[06:33:11] <peol> sindresorhus: addyosmani_: i'm done merging pull requests and stuff now. anyone up for tackling the formatting? ;)
[06:42:58] <sindresorhus_> Tip: With the newly released PHP 5.4, you can now do `php -S localhost:8000` to start a PHP server at the current directory. Useful for the testsuite. More info: http://php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php
[09:18:37] <amonat> I think I've found some now-unnecessary code in a test, at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/data.js#L188 (and again on line 202 of that file). Commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/d5f144a7bba98212d6fe9e257f722b62baf651f0 makes it so that the toJSON doesn't get returned from jQuery.data().
[09:18:38] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no commit found
[09:18:53] <amonat> If I've got that right, is it worth my filing a bug for it & submitting a pull request?
[09:20:31] <amonat> possibly the bot will like https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/d5f144a better

[09:30:14] <amonat> (sorry, didn't realize that clicking whois would put stuff into the channel)
[09:38:06] <ajpiano> amonat: it doesn't put it in the channel, it just prints it there in your client :)
[09:38:19] <ajpiano> amonat: file a bug and then reference in a PR if you are so inclined
[09:39:05] <amonat> Thanks ajpiano, will do!
[10:04:54] <amonat> ajpiano, I filed bug http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11435 and submitted pull request https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/699 for that.
[10:04:55] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by amonat (2m, 25s ago): Remove obsolete test code. Fixes #11435
[11:38:40] <amonat> For my pull request 699 I've been asked to "confirm the tests are passing in all supported browsers". Am I supposed to use TestSwarm to do this? (it looks like I'd need approval for an auth code)
[11:40:01] <ajpiano> no, run the unit tests locally
[11:49:51] <amonat> ajpiano, rwldrn who I gather is a Bocoup co-worker of yours, is the one who asked for that. I guess I have no idea how I'm supposed to test all supported browsers on my Mac, where I don't have any version of IE.
[11:50:18] <amonat> or Opera, or Firefox 3.6, etc.
[12:01:21] <ajpiano> run the unit tests in the browsers you have and then say which browsers you can't run the tests in
[12:02:50] <amonat> got it, will do!
[12:02:59] <amonat> thanks
[12:28:16] <paul_irish> who designed the .on / .off solution?
[12:37:16] <ajpiano> paul_irish: DaveMethvin did
[12:37:29] <paul_irish> k thought so
[12:37:39] <DaveMethvin> if it works, i did it
[12:37:48] <DaveMethvin> if not, then it was brandon or john
[12:39:01] <paul_irish> :)
