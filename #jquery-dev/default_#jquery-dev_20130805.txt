[08:38:14] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Migrate Core 1.x build #97: STILL FAILING in 3 min 17 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core%201.x/97/
[09:45:12] <siovene> DaveMethvin, hi! I was wondering if you had any plans to take perfectjs into use.
[09:45:48] <DaveMethvin> i haven't checked with orkel to see what he was using, did we get the copyright issue straightened out?
[09:45:54] <DaveMethvin> don't want Intel coming after us
[09:47:09] <siovene> DaveMethvin, yeah, all fine. It was approved for open sourcing.
[09:47:16] <DaveMethvin> cool
[09:49:12] <siovene> I think it's working pretty fine now, with the only limitation being the accuracy of benchmark.js
[09:50:17] <DaveMethvin> I think our bigger challenge now is to figure out a framework for running the tests and saving/displaying results in a job
[09:51:12] <siovene> DaveMethvin, so it can be part of CI?
[09:51:26] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:52:51] <siovene> DaveMethvin, well many test cases will work fine in phantomjs for instance, so we can just parse the output.
[09:53:21] <DaveMethvin> but phantomjs is an old webkit siovene, not sure that tests what we want to test perf-wise?
[09:53:51] <siovene> DaveMethvin, good point.
[09:54:51] <siovene> DaveMethvin, aren't you already running unit tests automatically on multiple browsers on Swarm?
[09:56:21] <DaveMethvin> yes, but the data collection and reporting is oriented towards unit tests
[09:57:06] <siovene> I don't know how testswarm works. Are you saying that I can't adapt perfectjs to work with it?
[09:57:22] <DaveMethvin> oh i am sure you can
[09:57:48] <DaveMethvin> but the current db tables and data collection is set up to count how many unit tests succeed or fail
[09:57:59] <DaveMethvin> not to time specific tests and save that timing in the db
[09:58:05] <DaveMethvin> and then to compare runs, etc
[09:58:41] <DaveMethvin> it's a simple matter of programming no doubt :)
[09:58:42] <siovene> DaveMethvin, I can make perfectjs output something so that if perf(B) > perf(A) then test = passed;
[09:59:14] <DaveMethvin> let's say B is the current result, then where is A stored?
[09:59:47] <siovene> No, like B is jquery 2.0 and A is jquery 1.9
[10:00:04] <siovene> if perf(B) > perf(A), you had an improvement, otherwise a regression
[10:00:06] <DaveMethvin> well that's even another pair of things to compare
[10:00:32] <DaveMethvin> A and B are vectors as well, since there's one for each browser
[10:00:45] <DaveMethvin> and there will be lose-no-matter-what scenarios
[10:00:48] <siovene> right
[10:01:04] <siovene> and benchmarkjs can't be 100% reliable, because sometimes CPU cycles go somewhere else
[10:01:36] <DaveMethvin> i guess i'm saying that i think the majority of our challenges are beyond the client-side benchmark harness at this point when it comes to CI
[10:01:52] <DaveMethvin> since we need to collect the data and analyze it elsewhere
[10:02:42] <siovene> wouldn't it be a first step if jquery adopted and contributed to perfectjs, manually at first (like checking stuff before pushing changes to the core), and then we think about CI?
[10:03:07] <snover> what is perfectjs
[10:03:20] <snover> oh, i found it.
[10:03:29] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/siovene/perfectjs right
[10:03:44] <siovene> snover, compares two versions of the same library for performance regressions, built on top of benchmark.js
[10:04:12] <DaveMethvin> siovene but i think we want to do the comparisons outside the client for CI don't we?
[10:04:37] <siovene> DaveMethvin, with client you mean browser?
[10:04:42] <DaveMethvin> right
[10:05:02] <DaveMethvin> i want to run the tests with one version of the library and send those results to a db
[10:05:11] <siovene> I don't think so... jquery ultimately runs on browsers. You might have a changeset that produce a performance regression on IE but not FF
[10:05:34] <DaveMethvin> and if the CI saves results you can see that
[10:05:51] <siovene> DaveMethvin, oh I see, so closer to how jsperf works
[10:06:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah, jsperf has the ability to save results
[10:06:10] <DaveMethvin> by browser
[10:06:17] <orkel> siovene weird i'm working on exact same thing
[10:06:18] <DaveMethvin> so it's a somewhat crude example
[10:06:37] <siovene> orkel, are you farther ahead? We can help each other :)
[10:06:49] <orkel> did not find this project before so i did start working from the 0
[10:07:01] <orkel> maybe :-)
[10:07:20] <orkel> in what platforms does perfect can be run?
[10:07:31] <siovene> DaveMethvin, I can do server side work too, so I can make a server app that uses perfectjs and saves results coming from different browsers, like jsperf
[10:07:53] <siovene> orkel, i've tried major browsers and node.
[10:08:13] <siovene> probably also rhino
[10:08:35] <orkel> how it can be run on them? do you use browserstack?
[10:08:54] <DaveMethvin> it would be helpful to get our testing team in on this, Krinkle, jzaefferer i am sure they have some great suggestions
[10:09:24] <siovene> orkel, no. perfectjs is just client side js
[10:09:27] <DaveMethvin> back in a few
[10:10:00] <orkel> so you have to manually open the page to get the results?
[10:10:25] <siovene> orkel, yeah
[10:10:38] <siovene> no automation yet
[10:10:48] <orkel> how would do the automation part?
[10:11:09] <siovene> we were just talking about it with DaveMethvin, but so far I'm not sure yet
[10:11:18] <orkel> DaveMethvin it would be very helpful if testing team could join the discussion
[10:11:37] <siovene> He was thinking of approaching the problem like jsperf: let people run the tests, and it saves the results to a db
[10:11:41] <snover> https://github.com/theintern/intern/pull/25 https://github.com/theintern/intern/issues/13 etc.
[10:12:19] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I saw I was mentioned in the discussion about lazy init with paul_irish 
[10:12:29] <orkel> i'm using saucelabs, we connect to the browser, get the result and dump them
[10:13:09] <orkel> so it should be automated from the start
[10:13:12] <mikesherov> I'm willing to tackle that, just need a bit of time to get used to having twins around that need my attention always
[10:13:48] <orkel> mikesherov m_gol wanted to tackle that too, maybe you could work together?
[10:14:04] <mikesherov> orkel: sure
[10:14:17] <mikesherov> if someone else has bandwidth to tackle those straight away, that'd be awesome
[10:14:35] <mikesherov> perhaps I can do code review with m_gol if he wants to take broad strokes at it
[10:15:14] <orkel> as i understand, you could already start working on that :-)
[10:15:19] <orkel> amd branch almost ready
[10:16:14] <orkel> siovene if tests needed to work with html, how would you define it?
[10:17:04] <siovene> orkel, the user of perfectjs needs to provide an HTML page (in which he/she includes perfectjs, some "performance unit tests" and all the HTML needed by those tests)
[10:18:20] <orkel> if i have a lot of perf tests and they all work with html, user should put it all on page?
[10:18:58] <siovene> orkel, you could have multiple pages but they need to be run separately
[10:21:38] <orkel> siovene in one week or soo, i will put together a proof of concept on what i'm trying to do, maybe you could review it or we could put those two projects together?
[10:22:50] <siovene> orkel, I'd love that!
[10:23:14] <orkel> okay then, i will email it to you
[10:23:29] <siovene> I've been working on this alone so far, and I'd rather collaborate with someone instead :)
[10:24:20] <siovene> orkel, sure, did you find my email?
[10:24:39] <orkel> salvatore@iovene.com ?
[10:25:05] <siovene> orkel, yeah that'd work
[10:25:14] <orkel> okay, good then!

[16:42:48] <Danwe_WMDE> jQuery.Callbacks().remove does not take Function[] but multiple Functions while add can deal with both. This is documented wrong/incomplete at http://api.jquery.com/callbacks.remove/ and http://api.jquery.com/callbacks.add/
[16:43:47] <Danwe_WMDE> discovered this in jQuery 1.8 but from looking at the current code, the bug still exists.
