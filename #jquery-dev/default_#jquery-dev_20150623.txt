[07:58:46] <m_gol> markelog: it seems the patch doesn't pass tests on IE8...
[08:00:48] <m_gol> I restarted those failed runs to be sure

[08:10:47] <markelog> m_gol: checked in ie8
[08:10:52] <markelog> before landing
[08:11:00] <markelog> maybe cache though
[08:11:08] <m_gol> markelog: might be a flake, let's see
[08:11:58] <m_gol> it takes it absurdly long time to re-spawn those IE8 instances...

[08:13:50] <markelog> hm
[08:13:57] <markelog> no, it seems it is still falling 
[08:14:49] <markelog> lets try again, to make sure
[08:17:39] <m_gol> markelog: did you clear cache in IE8 before testing? IE cache is veeeery aggressive
[08:18:02] <markelog> checked "always refresh from server" in dev tools
[08:20:15] <markelog> selector test is still falling, it seems it does something with attribute though
[08:20:32] <markelog> legitimated fail i guess
[08:20:39] <markelog> i will wait on reverting
[08:20:49] <markelog> will ask owner to contribute a fix
[08:22:47] <m_gol> ok, but we shouldn't wait too long, it's bad to have the development branch broken, you can't land anything in such a situation
[08:23:15] <markelog> i remember saying this to timmywil, he said it is acceptable situation
[08:23:33] <markelog> i.e. we can and should land another prs
[08:23:50] <timmywil> hmm?
[08:24:22] <timmywil> oh i see. compat is failing
[08:24:27] <markelog> timmywil: we had a discussion a while back, whenever or not dev branch should be always be green
[08:24:40] <timmywil> yes it should
[08:24:49] <timmywil> those were special times back then
[08:25:40] <markelog> okay, would appreciated note about changed policy though )
[08:26:27] <timmywil> Sorry, I didn't mean to imply before that the board shouldn't be green. It's not really a changed policy. We had flakey, hard-to-debug tests and it was necessary to keep moving at that time.
[08:27:06] <timmywil> Those tests have either been removed or fixed and we now have a pretty stable setup that passes consistently. Let's try to keep it that way.
[08:28:29] <markelog> nuh, that discussion was about landing features, you were implementing amd at the time, you said, we can have red tests on the board and fix them at release time
[08:29:09] <markelog> you said failing tests shouldn't stop us landing another prs
[08:31:00] <timmywil> I mean, do you want a hard policy here? I think we can allow for exceptions like that.
[08:31:01] <markelog> then, you landed amd pr, which broke most modules test
[08:31:16] <timmywil> amd was a big change and I didn't want to slow down development.
[08:31:38] <timmywil> For a case like this, where we've broken what looks like 8 tests, it should be fixed quickly.
[08:32:04] <markelog> okay
[08:32:23] <markelog> left a comment for the pr owner
[08:32:33] <markelog> i propose wait a day
[08:33:46] <timmywil> Thanks markelog
