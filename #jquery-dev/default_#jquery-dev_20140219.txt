[00:54:41] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15piuccio opened issue #535: Deep equal objects from different frames 02http://git.io/35svyQ
[03:42:14] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Build status of QUnit has been unstable ever since istanbul was introduced? Can you look into this and/or disable it for now?
[04:05:17] <Krinkle> Hm.. jQuery.ajax documentation says that the error handler will not be called if the request is cross-domain script or jsonp.
[04:05:34] <Krinkle> When making a request to a server that times out (or a hostname that doesn't resolve), in latest jQuery this properly gives me an error
[04:05:48] <Krinkle> in jQuery 1.8.3 however there is no error and the jqXHR stays pending indefinitely
[04:06:12] <Krinkle> This can be worked around by adding 'timeout' with some value, since it will then eventually timeout and trigger the error handler.
[04:06:40] <Krinkle> When making that broken request, I immediately get a red GET in the console, and it seems that latest jQuery is indeed somehow getting an error to process.
[04:06:51] <Krinkle> Intended change? Doc outdated? Bug? Feature?
[04:13:25] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/244
[04:14:33] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: also probably outdated docs, lots of issues there: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues?state=open
[04:14:44] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Your initial statement is incorrect
[04:14:52] <Krinkle> first unstable != first unstable build with that error 
[04:15:07] <Krinkle> http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/QUnit/374/ is just a browser timeout
[04:15:40] <jzaefferer> ah, right
[04:15:56] <jzaefferer> 375 has it
[04:16:31] <Krinkle> Hm..
[04:16:32] <Krinkle> right
[04:16:42] <Krinkle> so it's still possibly unrelated to instanbul
[04:16:44] <jzaefferer> still not introduced by switching to grunt-qunit-istanbul
[04:16:48] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Ah, right. It's the phantomjs version change
[04:17:07] <Krinkle> We need to manually install that font package
[04:17:21] <jzaefferer> what version change?
[04:20:52] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I suspect the lower level dependency on phantomjs changed (maybe a minor version or something)
[04:21:02] <Krinkle> and this one is now unable to see that package
