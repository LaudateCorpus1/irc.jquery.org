[16:52:24] <agcolom> timmywil: Would you have the url for the 2016 jQuery Core meetings agenda? I'm currently checking that the meetings repo point to the 2016 agendas. Thanks

[17:17:30] <agcolom> timmywil: it is not readable I think
[17:17:45] <timmywil> ah, of course
[17:17:46] <agcolom> (2015 was readable by anyone it seems)
[17:18:19] <timmywil> try now
[17:18:32] <agcolom> perfect! thank you :-)
[17:18:43] <timmywil> cool, np
[18:31:29] <zthall> Hi, I'm trying to run the jQuery unit tests locally but the documentation is very sparse: Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the "test" directory.
[18:31:48] <zthall> I've downloaded, installed WAMP. Now what? 
[18:32:44] <DaveMethvin> zthall: hey ... you should put your jquery cloned repo in the root of the server
[18:33:11] <DaveMethvin> that way you'll get to it via http://localhost/jquery/test/
[18:33:18] <DaveMethvin> there's an index.html in the test dir
[18:33:25] <zthall> Ahh, cool. And then that should be all? 
[18:33:40] <DaveMethvin> theoretically, if your wamp setup is all good
[18:34:07] <zthall> Awesome! Thanks DaveMethvin!
[18:34:11] <DaveMethvin> sure
[18:36:09] <zthall> Also, just read the full title of this chatroom. looks like I should be over on the jquery channel instead, but much appreciated with the help. 
[18:37:02] <DaveMethvin> you're in the right place zthall for help with geting tests set up
[18:37:21] <DaveMethvin> at least as long as someone answers :)
