[04:27:23] <bepolite> Helloo
[04:27:40] <bepolite> Are there a list of jquery bugs which are targetted at begineers?
[04:32:20] <kepta> hi
[04:32:27] <bepolite> hello
[07:54:16] <neophitetosaure> Hello
[07:57:02] <neophitetosaure> I'm having trouble in jquery using each + checkbox + click could someone help me ? http://paste.ubuntu.com/10621329/
[07:58:36] <neophitetosaure> as explained in the pastie, i would like that when some1 click on any avatar to select it, other checkboxes are unchecked
[08:02:01] <leobalter> neophitetosaure: ... nevermind, he left the channel
[08:02:48] <leobalter> Krinkle|detached: http://blog.yodersolutions.com/why-i-recommend-emberjs-over-angularjs/ this is one of the best posts I've read this month, the 2.0 and 1.x part is awesome. Thanks for linking it.
[08:11:36] <dcherman> leobalter: you've probably seen it, but you'd enjoy https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js/pull/10501 too.  the things that ember does while remaining backwards compatible is amazing, and that's understating it imo.
[08:15:54] <leobalter> dcherman: yes! QUnit is taking the same approach and this made me get rid of any doubts that we are in a good path.

[08:39:24] <Krinkle> leobalter: You're welcome!
[08:39:54] <Krinkle> leobalter: It reminded me of how scott_gonzalez advocates jQuery UI compatibility as well. The 1.9 support API in 1.10 is better than 1.9 ever was. It's implemented on top of it.
[08:39:56] <Krinkle> Similar paradigm
[08:40:16] <Krinkle> Makes so much sense and users love it
[08:41:02] <Krinkle> (I forgot whether scott said it about 1.8 in 1.9 or 1.9 in 1.10 etc., I imagine it applies to all recent N and N-1)
[08:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> It was 1.8 in 1.9
[08:41:28] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[08:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> But yes, it should apply to all after 1.8.
[08:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> But 1.9 has MUCH better support of the 1.8 API than 1.8 does.
[09:05:42] <Krinkle> rwaldron: Little ping on https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/2231 - preventing Wikimedia from upgrading to newer JSHint versions
[09:11:02] <rwaldron> Krinkle, thanks for the reminder, I'll have a look 
[09:15:06] <Krinkle> It can be worked around but by this point in time, use of '.static' has spread quite far through our code bases once we figured it was safe. We used to have klass and _static for a while, but phased it all out.
[09:15:50] <Krinkle> I mean raises, not klass.

[11:10:30] <fcarstens> jzaefferer: hi there. I'm interested in the GSoC project to improve QUnit's diffing capabilities. 
[11:10:52] <fcarstens> I played around with QUnit over the last few days. Can I send you a draft of my proposal to get some feedback? :)
[11:15:37] <jzaefferer> fcarstens: yes, though I've already seen at least one really good proposal for the diff idea. We haven't yet gotten any for the other two ideas. You should consider proposing for the Standard reporter interface, I'd like to see some work on that
[11:17:52] <ruipgil> jzaeffer: Hi, I summited a proposal yesterday, for the testing infrastructure
[11:18:23] <ruipgil> jzaefferer: First of all thanks for your feedback
[11:19:40] <ruipgil> jzaefferer: I'm improving it
[11:21:13] <jzaefferer> ruipgil: okay, just comment on the GSoC site when you've updated it
[11:23:05] <ruipgil> jzaefferer: When you say that I don't mention the current dependency, i.e. Testswarm, isn't the scope of the project to remove the dependency? Just to run the tests without the swarm.jquery.com instance, and then with CI tools run it to make sure that everything passes
[11:24:56] <ruipgil> jzaefferer: also, I do mention creating an abstract layer that can be used to run tests with karma, testswarm and browserstack-runner
[11:33:13] <jzaefferer> ruipgil: Its not so much about TestSwarm. Currently I need PHP to run the Core tests anywhere, also locally
[11:33:22] <jzaefferer> That's something that needs to be dealt with
[11:34:04] <jzaefferer> and due to how the TestSwarm architecture looks like, getting it to load files from a nodejs server isn't feasible
[11:36:44] <ruipgil> jzaefferer: yes, but wouldn't a tool such as karma deal with it by itself? And then replace the swarm for an instance that would run the tests each time a new commit happens. Much like with travisCI.
[11:38:20] <jzaefferer> ruipgil: no, that's not the issue; forget about TestSwarm, just consider how tests are run locally right now (e.g. apache with PHP module)
[11:38:31] <jzaefferer> ruipgil: I got to go now, markelog_ might be able to tell you more
[11:39:50] <markelog_> sure thing
[11:44:02] <ruipgil> so tests should run with a nodejs dependency (karma, intern, browserstack-runner, etc), right?
