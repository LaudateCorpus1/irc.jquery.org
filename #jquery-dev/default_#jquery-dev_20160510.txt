[16:47:04] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: the jsfiddle you linked to at https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery-deferred-reporter no longer works, perhaps you removed the jQuery used from your dropbox ;)
[16:47:44] <m_gol> it'd be more resilient to put it in a gist and link to via rawgit.com
[17:05:49] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: oh darn...yeah I'll fix that.
[17:06:48] <DaveMethvin> I also have a change to core for that, I've been debugging some stuff with 3.0 and it's often not easy with the error being caught but I think I can make a minor fix to improve it
[17:09:50] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: what fix?
[17:10:15] <DaveMethvin> reporting the stack when an error occurs 
[17:10:56] <DaveMethvin> I'll put together an issue tonight
