[16:13:10] <paul_irish> oh yeah i did.
[16:18:20] <robertmaxrees> oh no you di'int
[16:19:12] <DaveMethvin> ohai paul_irish robertmaxrees 
[16:19:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah he's asking questions again, troublemaker
[16:19:41] <DaveMethvin> imma give him a bad yelp review
[17:00:56] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15NekR opened pull request #2043: Fix .offset() to work in ShadowDOM (06master...061784-fix-offset-in-shadow-dom) 02http://git.io/F2GS
[17:25:28] <paul_irish>  /^.[^:#\[\.,]*$/ 
[17:30:38] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: is that a prefilter? :disabled is standard, :visible isn't and of course it can be a lot more complicated like input:visible
[17:30:57] <DaveMethvin> it's that question of how much extra time to invest to save the time you buy back by avoiding the standard methods
[17:32:01] <paul_irish> sorry i'm just pasting in rIsSimple while i read the source
[17:32:09] <DaveMethvin> also i wonder how much it might change if they were using the latest jquery instead of 1.8.3
[17:32:39] <DaveMethvin> which came out about the same time as chrome 23!
[17:32:51] <paul_irish> well it would change some things but not this, it looks like.
[17:33:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah, :hidden and such is just bad news
[17:33:14] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: im gathering numbers on what the difference is in time.
[17:33:17] <DaveMethvin> and calling it twice, ugh
[17:33:32] <paul_irish> well yeah here it's being called in every touchmove event
[17:33:49] <DaveMethvin> AAAUUUGH
[17:34:19] <paul_irish> watch https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama?veaction=edit booting up to see it hurt in a different situation
[17:34:21] <m_gol> paul_irish: I felt the pain just reading it :P
[17:36:15] <DaveMethvin> omg that wiki page is just horrible
[17:36:28] <paul_irish> oh yeah you betcha
[17:36:31] <DaveMethvin> i'll bench it as soon as i get the window back :)
[17:37:40] <paul_irish> yeah this one is worth a good look
[17:38:22] <paul_irish> in addition to :visible and :hidden  .. hide() and toggle() are also really rough.
[17:38:43] <DaveMethvin> all of those should be banished from code, i really wish we could
[17:38:53] <DaveMethvin> show/hide are bad because they mess up responsive designs
[17:39:07] <paul_irish> too much magic buried under such plain method names
[17:39:21] <DaveMethvin> don't want to override media queries with style attrs on the elements
[17:41:26] <m_gol> I believe we've long had a short, invitating demo with .show() or .hide(), right there on the front page ;P
[17:41:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[17:41:45] <paul_irish> ha
[17:42:05] <DaveMethvin> i think every js project makes it a point to have a horrible demo in their site
[17:42:20] <DaveMethvin> one that you should NEVER use
[17:43:18] <m_gol> well, it was pretty performant when running on our page in an iframe with 3 elements or sth ;p
[17:43:23] <DaveMethvin> well paul_irish all i can think as i look at that is "thanks Obama"
[17:43:39] <paul_irish> :D
[17:44:11] <DaveMethvin> i don't think i've ever had a flame chart taller than my screen
[17:44:32] <m_gol> :)
[17:45:04] <DaveMethvin> that is one deep rabbit hole
[17:47:34] <paul_irish> btw you can drag
[17:47:37] <paul_irish> and use WASD
[17:47:47] <paul_irish> in the flame charts
[17:47:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah and double click
[17:48:50] <DaveMethvin> i want full vi support so when i see something like this i can :wq
[17:48:59] <DaveMethvin> or :q!
[17:49:12] <robertmaxrees> DaveMethvin++
[17:49:26] <robertmaxrees> a ragequit for pages
[17:51:27] <DaveMethvin> ALL ON BOARD THE PERFORMANCE SLUG $('#bodyContent > :visible:not(#siteSub)').addClass('ve-init-mw-viewPageTarget-content').fadeTo('fast', 0.6);
[17:52:23] <Guest51481> I'm sorry Dave, I can't do that.
[17:52:31] <DaveMethvin> damn right you can't
[17:52:45] <Guest51481> hah the last second nick change made that wonderful.
[17:56:22] <paul_irish> are you nuking these selectors for 3.0?
[17:56:35] <DaveMethvin> wish we could
[17:56:39] <paul_irish> 3.0!
[17:56:43] <DaveMethvin> as you see they seem to be used everywhere
[17:56:44] <paul_irish> no better time
[17:56:51] <paul_irish> and slowing down pages everywhere
[17:57:15] <DaveMethvin> now that we're on the semver wagon i think you'll see us spinning the major version a lot more
[17:57:23] <DaveMethvin> probably 4.0 next year
[17:57:43] <DaveMethvin> but what diff does it make if yelp is on 1.8.3?
[17:58:03] <DaveMethvin> they'll have to rewrite their code, which will prob mean they'll stay on 1.8.3 rather than rewrite
[17:58:20] <paul_irish> I think it's not wise to support a legacy of poor development which enables the web continuing to be slow
[17:58:30] <DaveMethvin> that's what 1.9 was about as well
[17:58:33] <robertmaxrees> pfff.  it should only take one dev a few weeks to get them up, if that long.
[17:58:34] <DaveMethvin> but you can only do that so often
[17:59:02] <DaveMethvin> 3.0 has me worried, i am hoping our changes won't break a lot but honestly we can't tell
[17:59:13] <paul_irish> We're going to start using the DevTools to actively notify developers about these issues. If upgrading to 3.0 is the fix we will say that. 
[17:59:24] <DaveMethvin> it's fixable now
[17:59:34] <DaveMethvin> just don't use :hidden or :visible
[17:59:37] <robertmaxrees> i'd love to take both of those things for a spin using our sites.
[17:59:53] <m_gol> I think we could try to nuke them in 4.0.0
[17:59:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah me too
[18:00:03] <m_gol> but we already have huge things on agenda
[18:00:08] <m_gol> like Promises/A+ compat
[18:00:11] <DaveMethvin> right
[18:00:16] <m_gol> too much in one go can have a bad effect
[18:00:27] <robertmaxrees> hard to track down what broke what.
[18:00:28] <paul_irish> can i give you guys my 4.0 wishlist sometime?
[18:00:31] <paul_irish> :)
[18:00:36] <DaveMethvin> absolutely!
[18:00:41] <m_gol> if this goes smoothly, I'll be more certain about dumping these things in 4.0 :)
[18:00:43] <m_gol> sure! :)
[18:00:45] <DaveMethvin> we need someone to blame for all the borked stuff!
[18:00:59] <paul_irish> very happy to be that guy
[18:01:14] <m_gol> we can blame Paul Irish & Google in one go, PROFIT
[18:01:16] <paul_irish> i built up all this internet credibility over the years
[18:01:24] <m_gol> :)
[18:01:24] <DaveMethvin> WITH WHO
[18:01:25] <DaveMethvin> :)
[18:01:27] <paul_irish> might as well start chipping away at it
[18:01:43] <paul_irish> burn it all downnnn
[18:01:49] <DaveMethvin> poor 2018 paul_irish
[18:01:53] <DaveMethvin> no cred at all
[18:01:53] <paul_irish> who?
[18:02:06] <paul_irish> something about a boiler something who knows
[18:02:24] <paul_irish> come on guys lets go finish our typescript hoverboard
[18:02:34] <DaveMethvin> we can pull a lot of the stuff out and move it to jQuery Migrate
[18:02:38] <DaveMethvin> like we did last time
[18:02:47] <paul_irish> seems good
[18:02:48] <DaveMethvin> the problem is
[18:03:00] <DaveMethvin> some people continue to use it as a permanent crutch
[18:03:09] <DaveMethvin> instead of just to find their mistakes
[18:05:17] <robertmaxrees> the upgrade guide was very helpful for me personally.
[18:05:50] <DaveMethvin> glad to hear that
[18:06:05] <DaveMethvin> it was really the first time we did a BUNCH of breaking changes
[18:06:14] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: from now on pretend that you can speak to jquery users through the chrome devtools. the console, debugger, etc. 
[18:06:16] <robertmaxrees> i was able to send it to coworkers to tell them to stop doing bad things when i was working through the transition.
[18:06:20] <DaveMethvin> so jQuery Migrate was intended to make that as easy as possible
[18:06:52] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: can you have my spirit haunt their programs? cause i'll do it
[18:06:54] <paul_irish> just tell me what you want to tell them. we're going to be a lot more proactive what we see and telling developers to improve
[18:07:38] <DaveMethvin> i think we need to be a bit more scary in the docs and just say "stop using this, now"
[18:07:42] <paul_irish> exactly. can i get a .wav of you just  going eeeeeuuughhhhh  . Will play it at 0.0001 volume whenever migrate is on the page.
[18:07:53] <DaveMethvin> YEAH
[18:08:31] <DaveMethvin> but honestly, whatever you see that's buggering sites, let us know
[18:08:40] <DaveMethvin> then the hard part will be getting folks to upgrade
[18:08:56] <DaveMethvin> that wiki page tho
[18:09:00] <DaveMethvin> WHY
[18:09:13] <DaveMethvin> it's just so bad
[18:11:16] <robertmaxrees> well you see jquery just performs to terribly and
[18:11:33] <DaveMethvin> lol
[18:11:34] <DaveMethvin> you'd BETTER stop there :)
[18:11:55] <DaveMethvin> we have worked very hard to force layout efficiently, paul_irish can tell you
[18:12:03] <robertmaxrees> brb let me head over to ##javascript i'm sure they'll tell me about all the failings
[18:12:28] <paul_irish> i actually wrote up the full performance audit
[18:12:37] <paul_irish> let me clean it up and i'll share with you guys
[18:12:47] <DaveMethvin> thanks!

[20:00:14] <m_gol> `tell timmywil There's an old (2014-01-22) "delegation" branch of yours, can it be removed? this is the only such old branch
[20:00:15] <b-ot> m_gol: I’ll tell timmywil about that.
[21:35:47] <paul_irish> timmywil: i didnt understand what gibson was saying :x
[21:38:09] <timmywil> paul_irish: hehe, I think he was basically saying we could do it
[21:38:10] <b-ot> timmywil: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[21:38:15] <timmywil> `read
[21:38:15] <b-ot> timmywil: From m_gol, 1h 38m ago: There's an old (2014-01-22) "delegation" branch of yours, can it be removed? this is the only such old branch
[21:39:14] <paul_irish> okay cool. in my mind i dont see the complexitiy beyond /\:hidden|visible|animated/.test(expr)
[21:39:20] <timmywil> he was getting into the details of implementation. We couldn't detect invalid selectors perfectly without going through our parser, which we don't want to do for all selectors.
[21:39:40] <timmywil> but if we could get close enough
[21:39:51] <timmywil> then some would just go through sizzle unnecessarily
[21:40:10] <paul_irish> ah okay 
[21:40:19] <paul_irish> sgtm!
[21:40:56] <paul_irish> dropping ie8 in 4.0?
[21:40:58] <paul_irish> thats what dave said.
[21:41:32] <timmywil> we've been talking about a Sizzle branch that has the same browser support as jQuery 2.0
[21:42:02] <timmywil> but we would still maintain a branch that supports ie8, like jQuery 1.x
[21:42:08] <paul_irish> gotcha yah
[21:42:15] <paul_irish> that makes sense
