[05:10:39] <gnarf> because its trac running on mysql on an old box that still hasn't gotten all the bugs worked out yet...
[05:10:42] <gnarf> need someone who really wants to dig into getting that working right
[05:10:43] <gnarf> :)
[05:10:46] <gnarf> mgol: ^^^
[05:17:44] <mgol> duh, my IRC client messes my nick sometimes
[05:23:52] <gnarf> m_gol: was that you that replied on the ZNC thread? want me to setup an account?

[08:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> wat? https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/33
[08:11:45] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #33 by narenphp (15m 32s ago): Small UI issue with jquery site 
[08:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> I found the issue tracker for jquery.com. I shall use it to ask where to report issues with jquery.com!
[08:13:58] <JamesMGreene> Unless he means "his jQuery site"
[08:14:03] <JamesMGreene> pretty broken English
[08:37:54] <tj_vantoll> The bug is "rorate" instead of "rotate" on .cross-browser .feature-box-image:hover.
[13:26:18] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: jzaefferer: Sorry, wasn't available today. Had an appointment in real life.
[13:26:42] <Krinkle> I got my jQuery swag today. Messenger bag, shirt, hoodie. Nice stuff!
[14:04:27] <gnarf> sigh, i still haven't gotten my hoodie/shirt, but then again, i don't think i ever actually joined... maybe i missed the email from richard giving me my discount code? :)
[14:04:31] <gnarf> cc rworth
[14:26:27] <rworth> gnarf email to gnarf AT gnarf.net Mar 16 'jQuery Hack Night thank you gift'
[14:26:39] <rworth> I can resend/forward to gmail if you want
[14:26:50] <gnarf> yeah, fwd to my gmail please
[14:26:54] <gnarf> makes sense now why i didn't see it
[14:27:04] <gnarf> gnarf@gnarf.net gets ~300 spam a day so its hard for me to find shit there
[14:27:08] <gnarf> so i don't check it much
[14:27:34] <gnarf> im going to set that up to forward to my gmail someday
[14:27:43] <gnarf> and hope gmail can deal with my spam better than my own mail server does
[14:27:47] <rworth> that should take of the spam problem
[14:27:58] <rworth> yeah, that's how I dealt with my problem on my own server
[14:28:03] <rworth> such a difference
