[06:24:20] <gibson042> DaveMethvin|away: do you want a Sizzle 1.10.20 with only the webkit fix, or a "special edition" 2.1.1-jquery.2.1.2 without the "#" fix?
[06:42:10] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin closed issue #1798: Jquery caching DELETE Request on Android 02http://git.io/AbOA2A
[06:42:27] <DaveMethvin> s
[06:42:43] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: the other fixes looked pretty benign?
[06:42:59] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to include at least the memory leak fixes
[06:43:14] <gibson042> yeah
[06:43:15] <timmywil> sorry I couldn't get to that yesterday
[06:43:27] <gibson042> all should be 100% backwards compatible except for https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/commit/f204a6112216f31685717d9fc1bf6cabf42b2ef1
[06:43:42] <timmywil> That was my assessment
[06:43:49] <gibson042> and "drop unsupported browsers", but those were REALLY ancient
[06:43:53] <DaveMethvin> lets just pull that one out then
[06:43:58] <DaveMethvin> leave the rest
[06:44:03] <timmywil> +1
[06:44:11] <DaveMethvin> and since we'll be doing a breaking change we should do sizzle 3.x for jquery 3.x when we get there
[06:44:40] <gibson042> which breaking change are you thinking of?
[06:44:51] <DaveMethvin> the # one
[06:44:58] <gibson042> the "#" thing, while technically incompatible, was really a bug fix
[06:45:08] <timmywil> well....
[06:45:11] <DaveMethvin> you say potato ... :)
[06:45:23] <timmywil> technically, yes, but it's a behavior change
[06:45:23] <gibson042> those tests never should have been there in the first place because the selectors really are invalid
[06:45:32] <DaveMethvin> i see your point, and it's standards
[06:45:36] <timmywil> that's the technically part
[06:45:50] <timmywil> but, as you know, sometimes users depend on invalid behavior
[06:46:04] <DaveMethvin> from the jquery standpoint we're cool in any case b/c it's a 3.0
[06:46:10] <gibson042> I can't imagine jQuery major-bumping in an analogous case (dropping support for undocumented functionality)
[06:46:13] <DaveMethvin> we're allowed to be achy breaky
[06:46:56] <DaveMethvin> well look at the mess we've been discussing with plain objects, we can't even get everyone involved to agree to not shadow-support functionality
[06:47:07] <gibson042> I guess that's what I'm leaning on: we document nonstandard pseudos, but never promised to support other invalid selectors
[06:47:19] <gibson042> so changing that behavior doesn't affect the public API
[06:48:02] <DaveMethvin> it's probably not as critical for Sizzle to telegraph this point, but for jQuery i'd be worried about breakage now that we're trying to stick to semver
[06:48:07] <timmywil> it doesn't hurt to do the major version bump
[06:48:39] <DaveMethvin> it would not surprise me if we're going to 4.0 in 2016 tho so if we had something that was borderline next year we could hold it until then
[06:48:40] <timmywil> it is debatable whether the invalid selector should be seen as undocumented extension
[06:49:19] <gibson042> true
[06:49:44] <DaveMethvin> i think you can make a case either way, since semver specifically says undocumented behavior is not supported
[06:49:47] <timmywil> gibson042: do you want to make the changes? I could do it now.
[06:50:02] <gibson042> if you've got the time now, go for it
[06:50:10] <timmywil> ok
[06:50:16] <gibson042> "2.1.1-jquery.2.1.2" look good to you?
[06:50:40] <DaveMethvin> "special edition" :)
[06:50:52] <timmywil> oh,Â I was just going to do 2.1.2, but that works
[06:52:56] <timmywil> so, we just won't publish this to npm
[06:53:05] <gibson042> why not?
[06:54:06] <m_gol> 2.1.1-jquery.2.1.2 is technically a pre-release according to semver
[06:54:39] <gibson042> exactly
[06:54:41] <gibson042> "unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version"
[06:54:54] <gibson042> we're screwing with the chronology, but not the meaning
[06:55:00] <m_gol> it just seems weird to have a formally pre-release Sizzle in jQuery
[06:55:50] <gibson042> the alternative would be cherry-picking what we want into 1.10.20
[06:56:18] <gibson042> but both get us to the same place
[06:56:20] <m_gol> ...and suddenly having a pre-release Sizzle in jQuery seems a nice idea ;)
[06:56:34] <m_gol> ok, I guess there is no perfect solution here
[06:57:08] <m_gol> and formally speaking jQuery stable version guarantees stability of its internal Sizzle copy wrt previous jQuery patch versions
[06:57:19] <m_gol> so I guess we're formally OK

[07:17:06] <timmywil> bah, I shouldn't have put that on master, should I
[07:17:27] <timmywil> well, this will work
[07:17:30] <m_gol> you can always revert the revert ;)
[07:17:39] <timmywil> hehe, yea
[07:18:41] <timmywil> on a side note, it's times like this where I'm glad we don't use version ranges
[07:18:43] <m_gol> so we're not taking out the "drop unsupported browsers" commit?
[07:18:53] <m_gol> ;)
[07:18:58] <timmywil> those were too legacy anyway
[07:19:09] <m_gol> this one wouldn't be picked up, though, as it's a pre-release
[07:19:14] <m_gol> by ^2.0.0
[07:19:27] <timmywil> I meant with all our npm packages
[07:19:31] <m_gol> sure
[07:19:45] <m_gol> I usually add ~ to deps that are used by outsiders
[07:19:51] <m_gol> e.g. a Grunt task wrapping a lib
[07:19:57] <m_gol> and the rest is pinned
[07:20:08] <m_gol> in my own projects

[08:00:23] <timmywil> well, when you put it that way
[08:01:07] <timmywil> I saw it as, "this is not an official release"
[08:01:11] <gibson0421> heh
[08:01:12] <gibson0421> ok
[08:01:18] <gibson0421> no worries
[08:01:55] <m_gol> it always puzzled me when Sizzle had a pre-release version in its comment inside jQuery ;)
[08:02:12] <m_gol> even before I started contributing
[08:02:48] <m_gol> but it's not a huge problem
[08:37:39] <DaveMethvin> YAY! Tests look good. I'll wrap up the release this afternoon, thanks guys!
