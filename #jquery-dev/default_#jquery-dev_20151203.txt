[10:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: As far as I know, kborchers got rid of as much as he possibly could and has no plans to sell anything. Your only hope would be for DevSwag to start carrying a hoodie, but I wouldn't expect that to happen.
[10:32:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's entirely possible that there are a few still sitting around somewhere though.
[10:36:53] <Krinkle> Ah, DevSwag is the new shop. Is that linked from anywhere?
[11:06:19] <kborchers> Krinkle: DevSwag is at http://devswag.com/ but they only have the tshirt and stickers and don't think will add anything else. we don't run that shop ourselves they just license the logo

[18:04:31] <saptaks> Hi everyone..
[18:05:34] <saptaks> I have been trying to add noConflict to sizzle like that in jQuery but I can't really get how to do it correctly. Can someone please guide?
[18:07:16] <saptaks> as suggested in this issue, https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/352, I tried to check this in sizzle, but this check doesn't work with jQuery.noConflict either.. Am I missing something?
[18:45:18] <saptaks> @gibson42 can you please help..
[19:06:31] <robertmaxrees> saptaks wrong channel for support.
[19:06:48] <robertmaxrees> you want #jquery
[19:07:31] <saptaks> Well this is about an issue I was trying to create a fix. So, I thought that I should ask here..
[19:08:09] <robertmaxrees> ah, i thought you were looking for general assistance.  nevermind then!
[19:08:20] <saptaks> ok. :)
[19:15:24] <saptaks> btw robertmaxrees, can you suggest me some javascript related intermediate issues that I can solve?
[19:15:59] <saptaks> I would really like to contribute..
