[05:25:57] <mikesherov> .
[05:26:03] <addyosmani> ..
[05:26:14] <mikesherov> LOL, I was looking for mesages.
[05:26:23] <addyosmani> and here I thought you were communicating in morse code!
[05:26:33] <mikesherov> --. .-. ..
[05:26:39] <mikesherov> whatever that says
[05:26:47] <addyosmani> .. .... . .... ...
[05:26:52] <addyosmani> you did NOT just call my mother that!
[05:26:55] <mikesherov> LOL
[05:26:56] <addyosmani> *snaps fingers*
[05:27:05] <mikesherov> Oh no you di-int
[05:27:22] <addyosmani> You mean ... .... . . . ...  of course ; )
[05:27:27] <addyosmani> we're too good for actual letters
[05:28:10] <mikesherov> While your here, mind if I bounce an idea of off you?
[05:28:17] <addyosmani> sure thing
[05:28:26] <mikesherov> so... box-sizing: border-box
[05:29:03] <addyosmani> yep
[05:29:04] <mikesherov> It's causing problems in jQuery because .width() always gets "content width" regardless of an elements box-sizing value
[05:29:18] <mikesherov> because it's currently based off of offsetWidth
[05:29:37] <mikesherov> which is fine... that's a proprietary jQuery api
[05:29:49] <mikesherov> however, it carries over into .css('width')
[05:30:09] <addyosmani> I would expect it to do that, but I can see where that can cause issues
[05:30:24] <mikesherov> Yeah, I'm fine with what .width() does
[05:30:31] <mikesherov> but I'd argue that .css('width') should take into account box-sizing
[05:30:49] <mikesherov> because it causes this bug: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11004
[05:31:30] <mikesherov> and others that will be bound to show up in animate once box-sizing: border-box is still not being widely used (as IE7 support begins being dropped)
[05:31:39] <addyosmani> imo, we should come up with a solution or doc the issue but I wouldn't create discrepancies between css('width')/.width() etc. The assumption tends to be that they're 1:1 for a lot of cases
[05:31:51] <mikesherov> Yeah, but they are not
[05:32:03] <addyosmani> if only most people knew that :p
[05:32:07] <mikesherov> but the thing is
[05:32:10] <mikesherov> it's still early
[05:32:44] <mikesherov> its early enough to add a cssHook for the dimensions apis
[05:32:48] <addyosmani> truee.
[05:32:58] <mikesherov> and allow .css('width') to do the right thing
[05:33:08] <addyosmani> is this something you're just thinking about atm or have you been working on some changes to it in a super-secret fork somewhere? :)
[05:33:27] <mikesherov> and right now, if you have box-sizing: border-box on an elem, and you do:
[05:34:08] <mikesherov> elem.css('width',elem.css('width')); it'll make the the element smaller!
[05:34:13] <mikesherov> No, just something I plan on doing
[05:34:21] <mikesherov> the change is actually really small
[05:35:42] <mikesherov> $( this ).css( "width","+=200" ); will mess up too
[05:36:15] <mikesherov> because the get hook gets "content width" and the set hook sets the css width property
[05:36:27] <addyosmani> My two cents: it sounds like this change is sensible but it'll of course need to be tested to make sure it doesn't result in other weird quirks we're not thinking about atm.
[05:36:33] <mikesherov> Yeah
[05:36:41] <mikesherov> I'll test the hell out of it
[05:36:46] <addyosmani> I'd just go ahead and make the change so it can be tested out further. Happy to play around with it once its ready. As you mentioned, prolly won't take too long to add in.
[05:36:58] <mikesherov> the entire css.js code is in the RAM of my brain
[05:37:07] <addyosmani> hahaha
[05:37:17] <addyosmani> That must be one full brain ; )
[05:37:51] <mikesherov> LOL, it's not too bad
[05:38:07] <mikesherov> I'm just trying to prepare for the coming box-sizing: border-box tidal wave
[05:38:13] <mikesherov> it's starting to show
[05:38:37] <addyosmani> seen a few tickets for it start to come through (other than 11004)?
[05:38:51] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/search?q=border-box&go=&ticket=on
[05:39:13] <addyosmani> So NOTHING at all then!
[05:39:35] <mikesherov> well, it'll continue to creep in
[05:39:51] <mikesherov> border-box is gaining ground as people move to responsive design
[05:39:54] <mikesherov> and fluid layouts
[05:39:56] <mikesherov> and mobile
[05:40:08] <mikesherov> all signs point to border-box on mobile
[05:40:32] <mikesherov> Also, IE7 will b getting updated to IE8 on XP machines...
[05:40:35] <addyosmani> ah. fun times ahead, eh? :)
[05:40:46] <mikesherov> well, like I said, I'm preparing for it
[05:40:58] <addyosmani> I'm glad someone is looking at this
[05:40:58] <mikesherov> I have a few pulls open already to deal with it
[05:41:06] <addyosmani> aha. already a few steps ahead!
[05:41:07] <mikesherov> just need to tie up some loose ends
[05:41:29] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pulls/mikesherov
[05:41:36] <mikesherov> both of those PRs deal with it
[05:41:49] <addyosmani> Niiice mikesherov!
[05:42:03] <addyosmani> I'll have to take a look at them later. Definitely run this by Dave when he's about.
[05:42:08] <mikesherov> Yeah
[05:42:09] <addyosmani> Sure he'll have further insights
[05:42:11] <mikesherov> it's in the 1.8 vote
[05:42:31] <mikesherov> actually, no, the .css('width') change is not in there
[05:42:57] <mikesherov> but vendor prefixes are
[05:43:03] <mikesherov> which are a prereq for this
[05:43:44] <addyosmani> Well I'll be sure to upboat. I think there's a genuine need for this.
[05:44:04] <mikesherov> yeah, agreed, especially if jQuery wants to be taken seriously on mobile
[05:45:27] <addyosmani> I have to bolt, but great work so far mikesherov!. I'll catch you later!
[05:45:45] <mikesherov> later!
[05:45:46] <mikesherov> have a great day
[05:46:11] <addyosmani> you too! :)
[05:48:00] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell timmywil please read the conversation I had with addyosmani about .css('width') vs. .width(): http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery-dev/%23jquery-dev_20111216.log.html
[05:49:33] <mikesherov> what? where's bot-t?
[05:53:07] <Jon47> reading this article john resig posted on twitter awhile back: http://www.dartlang.org/articles/improving-the-dom/
[05:53:07] <Jon47> made me realize that everything good I learned about javascript and the DOM, I learned from jquery, and that all these technologies are both evolving in response to each other, and jquery is like a gateway drug into learning the  how these things *really* work, i just felt like I had to say thank you to all the people who have contributed to it
[05:54:46] <mikesherov> :-)
[05:55:02] <mikesherov> Jon47, you should get involved in jQuery!
[05:55:28] <Jon47> heh
[05:55:34] <mikesherov> no, seriously
[05:55:43] <Jon47> i've been reading a bit about it from all this move the web forward stuff
[05:55:49] <Jon47> maybe i could get started by helping triage bugs or something
[05:56:22] <mikesherov> or fixing bugs, or reporting bugs, or creating test cases, or fork the project on github and submit pull requests
[05:56:28] <mikesherov> there's tons you can do
[05:57:45] <Jon47> alright, i'm inspired
[05:59:00] <mikesherov> about 3 months ago, I was where you are right now
[05:59:09] <mikesherov> Now I'm on the core team
[05:59:14] <mikesherov> we're all just devs here
[05:59:36] <mikesherov> I think you'd be surprised about just how easy it is to make an impact
[06:02:36] <Jon47> I think I've got a ways to go before I've got the chops to be on the team, but I'll take a stab at helping out for sure, thanks for the encouragement :)
[06:04:23] <mikesherov> well, yeah, everyone has hurdles. Just saying that you can make an impact too.
[06:04:28] <mikesherov> Have a great day
[06:04:31] <mikesherov> Gotta go!
[07:19:41] <timmywil> .
[08:07:40] <DaveMethvin> hey johnbender
