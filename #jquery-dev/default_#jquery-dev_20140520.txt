[01:43:52] <jzaefferer> leobalter: I was thinking of a script that updates JS files to switch from globals to the assert argument
[06:59:38] <leobalter> jzaefferer: I forked jQuery-migrate to study how they worked on the warnings. That's my next task in my list, right after I'm done with documentations.
[07:03:20] <jzaefferer> leobalter: okay. As mentioned before: I was thinking of a script that updates JS files to switch from globals to the assert argument
[07:04:51] <leobalter> humm, got it, but I'm certainly not the best on doing this kind of scripts. 
[07:05:52] <leobalter> I can go in the manual way, if you don't mind. I know I always need a review, but I'll stay 100% focused.
[07:28:00] <Krinkle> Hm.. I think I just found a false positive for jq migrate giving me a notice, but I'm not sure now actually
[07:28:08] <Krinkle> the "value" attribute of list item elements
[07:28:34] <Krinkle> triggers a "don't use value in attr()" notice
[07:28:50] <Krinkle> I suppose properties will work there as well, but that goes for all documented attributes.
[08:16:34] <jayesh92> Hi, could any 1 suggest is it a good a idea to make a JS based applctn using jQuery moblie and then port it to android, using phonegap
[08:16:44] <jayesh92> I need to make a native application
[08:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> jayesh92: Support is in #jquery
