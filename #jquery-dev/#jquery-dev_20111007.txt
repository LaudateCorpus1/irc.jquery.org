[06:25:35] <timmywil> what about exposing the html5 fragment instead?
[06:26:15] <timmywil> i'm picking up on a conversation that was 11 hours ago
[06:29:44] <timmywil> nvm, that wouldn't carry over to other documents
[06:57:40] <rwaldron> timmywil
[06:57:42] <rwaldron> yt?
[06:57:49] <timmywil> yo
[06:57:55] <rwaldron> hey
[06:57:56] <rwaldron> https://github.com/rwldrn/jquery/pull/new/10427
[06:58:03] <rwaldron> basic idea
[06:58:23] <rwaldron> it needs to create safefragments both early and then whenever
[06:58:34] <rwaldron> pretty simple
[06:58:38] <rwaldron> i'm annoyed by the op though
[06:58:50] <rwaldron> i hate when insane assumptions are made
[06:59:13] <rwaldron> "i deleted shit from the test and added functionality that jQuery ultimately decided against supporting"
[06:59:19] <rwaldron> wtf
[06:59:46] <timmywil> yea, i noticed that.  you blitzed me
[07:00:35] <rwaldron> pay back is a BITCH
[07:00:37] <rwaldron> <3
[07:00:41] <timmywil> hahaha
[07:00:58] <rwaldron> holy shit
[07:01:09] <rwaldron> hahahaha look at the latest pull request
[07:01:20] <rwaldron> oh wait, nvm
[07:01:24] <rwaldron> i thought it was for jQuery
[07:01:29] <rwaldron> its for Sizzle
[07:01:40] <rwaldron> nvm, not as funny as I thought
[07:01:56] <rwaldron> but still...
[07:01:59] <rwaldron> REALLY FUNNY
[07:02:58] <rwaldron> well, just this...
[07:02:58] <rwaldron> https://github.com/berkerpeksag/sizzle/commit/84e3ecf9f6628f5a85e18b9c059cd1495614efb6
[07:02:59] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on sizzle by berkerpeksag (11m, 15s ago): Fixed #7796. Regexp includes the whitespace into the match for the attribute.
[07:03:11] <rwaldron> the broken style is free
[07:03:19] <gnarf> rwaldron - ewww on that bug u sent me
[07:03:52] <timmywil> rwaldron: yea ouch
[07:03:59] <rwaldron> hey gnarf sorry, i didnt rally know what to do with that
[07:04:05] <rwaldron> really*
[07:04:10] <timmywil> but there must be a way to not do a second replace
[07:04:13] <rwaldron> i figured it was something you could fix easily?
[07:04:14] <gnarf> techincally queue: true isn't a valid option
[07:04:19] <gnarf> it accepts a string or false
[07:04:23] <rwaldron> really?
[07:04:35] <gnarf> but i can see since it used to accept false that true might of been seen as the "other" option
[07:04:41] <gnarf> and it should prolly get normalized to "fx"
[07:04:46] <rwaldron> docs need fixin'?
[07:04:47] <rwaldron> http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[07:04:53] <DaveMethvin> .
[07:04:56] <DaveMethvin> hey guys
[07:04:59] <rwaldron> hey DaveMethvin
[07:05:11] <rwaldron> what does "." mean?
[07:05:12] <gnarf> rwaldron: docs are out of date
[07:05:20] <rwaldron> timmywil does that occassionally as well..
[07:05:27] <rwaldron> gnarf o gotcha
[07:05:29] <DaveMethvin> just means "I'm here, tell me if anyone has messages for me"
[07:05:36] <gnarf> rwaldron: thats his way of asking bot-t for any messages
[07:05:36] <timmywil> it's a bot check
[07:05:51] <rwaldron> hahaha
[07:05:52] <rwaldron> thanks
[07:05:53] <DaveMethvin> bot-t has really been slacking off lately tho
[07:05:53] <rwaldron> thanks
[07:05:55] <rwaldron> and thanks
[07:06:20] <timmywil> ?tell DaveMethvin STOP ENDING MY SENTENCES FOR ME
[07:06:26] <DaveMethvin> haha no bot
[07:06:32] <timmywil> dam
[07:06:41] <DaveMethvin> ?tell bot-t YOU'RE FIRED
[07:07:52] <DaveMethvin> so we haven't gotten much in the way of 1.7 bugs
[07:08:43] <gnarf> rwaldron: i think i have a solution for queue: true
[07:08:48] <kswedberg> gnarf: I can update the docs if you want. just let me know what the update should be and at what version it went into effect. or you can update the docs if you want.
[07:09:04] <gnarf> kswedberg: queue is no longer a boolean, it takes a string
[07:09:10] <gnarf> to name a queue
[07:09:16] <kswedberg> as of?
[07:09:19] <DaveMethvin> do you think there's much code that uses queue: true?
[07:09:21] <gnarf> 1.7
[07:09:29] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i'm not sure
[07:09:29] <kswedberg> ah. ok.
[07:09:30] <DaveMethvin> b/c if so we should switcch it to "fx"
[07:09:36] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: agree
[07:09:58] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i was just gonna do opt.queue === true ? "fx" : opt.queue in jQuery.speed
[07:10:16] <kswedberg> gnarf: hehe. I was just going to suggest that
[07:10:17] <DaveMethvin> sounds easy enough ... but it won't add bytes, right :P
[07:10:35] <gnarf> that looks like about 12 bytes :)
[07:10:41] <DaveMethvin> WAT!?
[07:10:46] <DaveMethvin> oh well
[07:12:11] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i think that br:hidden bug is cantfix
[07:12:32] <timmywil> unless we want to make them always visible or always hidden
[07:12:36] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: do you know the cause?
[07:12:46] <DaveMethvin> i thought the height would differ
[07:12:48] <timmywil> yea, the default offsetHeight of a br is 19 in ff
[07:12:52] <timmywil> it's 0 in webkit
[07:13:05] <DaveMethvin> so why didn't .height() differ?
[07:14:06] <DaveMethvin> we could look at display:none for br i guess?
[07:15:05] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/sgmLNQ
[07:15:05] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Merge pull request #531 from rwldrn/events.js-cleanup - Dave Methvin
[07:15:07] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: thanks!
[07:15:16] <rwaldron> :)
[07:15:26] <rwaldron> no problemo
[07:15:51] <DaveMethvin> damn i wish ppl would stop making PRs out of the blue, or for 1.8 features
[07:16:05] <DaveMethvin> those things are gonna be STALE STALE STALE by the time we try to land em
[07:17:07] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I put a breakpoint in the filter and it's 19 there, but 0 in getWH
[07:17:17] <timmywil> so idk wtf
[07:17:22] <DaveMethvin> lol
[07:18:18] <DaveMethvin> well getWH takes off padding/border
[07:18:40] <DaveMethvin> i'll look at the fiddle again
[07:20:05] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: no i mean, straight offsetHeight is different
[07:20:31] <timmywil> i thought that too at first, but no!
[07:20:42] <kswedberg> timmywil: did you try naturalWidth / naturalHeight for <br> in webkit?
[07:20:54] <timmywil> no
[07:21:09] <kswedberg> I had to do that for <img> recently
[07:21:22] <kswedberg> in a weird edge case
[07:21:50] <kswedberg> not sure if it applies here, but thought I'd throw this piece of spaghetti against the wall
[07:24:02] <timmywil> kswedberg: I think those only works for images
[07:24:13] <timmywil> work
[07:24:14] <kswedberg> ah. ok. just my luck.
[07:24:30] <kswedberg> makes sense, though
[07:24:56] <DaveMethvin> wow timmywil that is bizzarro
[07:25:24] <timmywil> http://gyazo.com/c0b8a40e7d62a737da560db4d4eaea2f
[07:26:04] <timmywil> http://gyazo.com/60ebb4df8a17903d3ca1744ac9afbed4
[07:26:24] <timmywil> strange as hell
[07:27:37] <timmywil> why would the offset property be different a cycle later?
[07:28:05] <DaveMethvin> didn't that case go through swap() tho?
[07:29:05] <timmywil> hmm, why does it need to?
[07:30:11] <DaveMethvin> b/c the offsetHeight was 0
[07:30:35] <timmywil> but it wasn't
[07:31:07] <timmywil> at least it wasn't a cycle earlier
[07:34:48] <timmywil> ohhhhh
[07:34:56] <timmywil> because offsetWIDTH was 0
[07:34:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's going thru swap
[07:35:00] <timmywil> duh
[07:35:16] <DaveMethvin> height/width, whats the diff :P
[07:35:18] <timmywil> well shoot
[07:35:42] <timmywil> i'd hate to add another function call to the filter
[07:35:55] <DaveMethvin> such a pain
[07:36:09] <DaveMethvin> unhiding these stupid elements is soooooo damn slow i bet
[07:36:39] <DaveMethvin> "Dear rendering engine, imagine for a second that these elements were visible. What size woudl they be? Take your time."
[07:36:48] <timmywil> ha
[07:37:57] <DaveMethvin> so when it goes thru swap, changing those css props make it take up space somehow
[07:38:08] <timmywil> other way around
[07:38:26] <timmywil> it no longer is height 19
[07:39:43] <timmywil> we switch it from inline to block
[07:40:02] <timmywil> which probably removes it's relativity to line-height or something
[07:40:29] <DaveMethvin> a br is a strange element indeed
[07:40:44] <timmywil> yar
[07:40:53] <DaveMethvin> does it even make sense to hide a br?
[07:41:07] <timmywil> i suppose it does if it takes up space
[07:41:10] <DaveMethvin> lol
[07:47:37] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: what about width === 0 || height === 0 instead of &&
[07:47:52] <timmywil> it's not visible if either one of those is 0 right?
[07:48:13] <DaveMethvin> i vaguely recall that we needed both for a tr/td fix in IE
[07:48:18] <DaveMethvin> but i could be wrong
[07:48:47] <timmywil> ok, i'll just comment for now and do some paid work for a while :)
[07:49:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah i have a meeting at 11 so i'd better get back to paying work too
[08:03:48] <rwaldron> ugh
[08:03:54] <rwaldron> ajpiano yt?
[08:03:57] <gnarf> DaveMethvin / timmywil: should we support queue: true ?
[08:04:27] <rwaldron> the dude with the unknown elements ticket and patch just emailed me directly
[08:04:28] <timmywil> has passing true always thrown an exception?
[08:04:34] <ajpiano> rwaldron: what'd he say
[08:04:52] <rwaldron> accusing me of stonewalling him for my own gain
[08:04:59] <gnarf> timmywil: no - it just didn't do anything, passing true was just like passing nothing
[08:05:06] <ajpiano> rwaldron: huh?
[08:05:08] <gnarf> its a pretty tiny fix too
[08:05:10] <gnarf> lemme push it up
[08:05:15] <ajpiano> what do you stand to ... gain??
[08:06:02] <timmywil> in that case, i'd fix it.  I could see a case for queue: someBooleanVariable
[08:07:10] <rwaldron> dammit timmywil is triaging bugs LAMF
[08:07:21] <rwaldron> save some for the rest of us dammit
[08:07:44] <timmywil> haha, work is slow!

[08:53:29] <rwaldron> it's my mistake, but that passed in error
[08:53:35] <rwaldron> wonder if we can tweeeeaaaak it
[08:53:54] <timmywil> ha, i was just doing that jaubourg
[08:54:43] <rwaldron> close 533 while you're at it
[08:55:14] <rwaldron> also... w/r 526 (padolsey's pull)
[08:55:31] <rwaldron> he seems to have gone away?
[08:56:15] <rwaldron> I'm indifferent about the whole thing, it adds 5 bytes but removes a split
[10:58:48] <timmywil> jzaefferer: i noticed the keyup event handler in the validate plugin is quite slow on the iPad
[10:59:13] <timmywil> is there an easy way to disable that if the only check is required: true?
[11:00:23] <timmywil> i could just leave it out
[11:01:10] <kborchers> timmywil: i almost always disable onkeyup $(".selector").validate({onkeyup: false});
[11:01:11] <bot-t> (7 hours 34 mins ago) <jzaefferer> tell kborchers tried to clarify the intent of that popup tooltip demo, see wiki
[11:01:48] <jzaefferer> timmywil: would have to look into that
[11:03:12] <timmywil> jzaefferer: ok, just a thought. i'll just disable it.
