[19:33:44] <prbc> Hi, should I ask for someone to assignee an issue to me or should I just make a PR?
[19:34:20] <DaveMethvin> prbc which issue?
[19:35:50] <snover1> i think the answer is yes
[19:36:25] <DaveMethvin> that is the safe answer
[19:36:56] <prbc> DaveMethvin: I'm a novice programmer, and I would like to start contributing with jQuery. I found this issue here http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14484
[19:37:24] <prbc> And I suppose I can do this
[19:37:29] <prbc> But I'm not sure
[19:37:52] <DaveMethvin> prbc cool ... make a comment in that ticket that you're going to work on it, be sure to register on the bug tracker
[19:38:07] <DaveMethvin> be sure to read all the stuff on contribute.jquery.org
[19:38:29] <DaveMethvin> well, at least MOST of the stuff
[19:38:51] <DaveMethvin> and then you can send a pull request
[19:38:53] <prbc> Should I describe what I indent to do?
[19:39:04] <prbc> Or just make the PR
[19:39:11] <DaveMethvin> you can discuss it here if you want
[19:39:13] <prbc> intend**
[19:41:05] <prbc> It would be nice, im afraid of messing everything
[19:41:15] <prbc> Let me think how to start
[19:41:26] <DaveMethvin> we're supposed to prevent you messing everything
[19:41:28] <DaveMethvin> :)
[19:41:52] <prbc> :D
[19:52:22] <prbc> Ok, here https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/css.js
[19:52:28] <prbc> we are checking if the value is a string("25px") or a number(25)
[19:52:46] <prbc> I thought we should check with regex inside "if line 265" if there is a '%' char inside that string.
[19:52:53] <prbc> If there is, we could calculate element width in percentage with parents width. And thene we calculate the new value for it.
[19:53:10] <prbc> Make sense?
[19:53:26] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked, is that what animations do as well? the reporter said it worked properly there
[19:53:46] <DaveMethvin> then i'm wondering whether we should use the same code for both
[19:54:57] <DaveMethvin> i have to run, but some folks should be around tomorrow if you have more questions
[19:55:53] <prbc> DaveMethvin: sorry, I don't get what you mean
[19:56:01] <prbc> is there another similar issue?
[19:57:35] <prbc> Which time I can find people to discuss this here?
