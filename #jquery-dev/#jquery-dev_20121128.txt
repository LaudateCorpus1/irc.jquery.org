[13:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Any chance you remember what I was looking at when I filed this? https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=678678
[13:04:58] <paul_irish> ummmmmm
[13:05:00] <paul_irish> no idea
[13:05:06] <paul_irish> can give you my IRC log for that day
[13:05:08] <paul_irish> but that's the best i got
[13:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that would probably help.
[13:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see if we have logs of jQuery IRC channels that far back.
[13:06:12] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:06:17] <scott_gonzalez> It was discussed in #jqueryui-dev
[13:31:04] <jaubourg> plop
[13:41:27] <gf3> GROSS jaubourg 
[13:41:45] <jaubourg> hey gf3... what did I do again?
[13:41:57] <gf3> You plopped in the channel
[13:42:09] <DaveMethvin> :D
[13:42:17] <jaubourg> I so did that :P
[13:42:33] * DaveMethvin gives gf3 a shovel
[13:42:40] * gf3 cleans the channel
[13:42:54] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: regarding the method/type aliasing PR, I'm wondering if the size increase was against the first, invalid but shorter, version of the patch
[13:42:59] <jaubourg> and hi
[13:43:06] <jaubourg> the dirty frenchman is here
[13:43:12] <DaveMethvin> hi jaubourg!
[13:43:23] <DaveMethvin> i just want to keep things simple for now
[13:43:49] <DaveMethvin> i'm a simple man
[13:44:23] <jaubourg> I hear you but I still think it's the wrong approach... granted it was my own in the first place
[13:44:53] <DaveMethvin> well the code won't be read-only after 1.9, if we need to change it we can
[13:44:58] <DaveMethvin> :P
[13:45:19] <jaubourg> btw, I won't be able to merge this right now... I left the laptop at my flat and I'm at the gf's flat... didn't think first
[13:45:22] <jaubourg> as usual :P
[13:45:40] <DaveMethvin> laptop, what about the ipad?
[13:45:56] <DaveMethvin> i would think you were using a blackberry to commit code by now
[13:46:06] <gf3> Git for S60
[13:46:09] <jaubourg> oh dang, I could do that on the ipad, you're right... haven't toyed with it since I went to Korea because I had the laptop
[13:46:11] <jaubourg> silly me
[13:46:23] <DaveMethvin> oh i was just kidding, and look at what i did
[13:47:18] <jaubourg> problem is I'm very bad at squashing stuff... did you admire how I duplicated gibson042's commits when merging the ajax unit tests?
[13:47:28] <DaveMethvin> i've had my days too
[13:47:31] <jaubourg> still dunno how that happened
[13:47:33] <DaveMethvin> not sure what happened there
[13:47:51] <DaveMethvin> basically, you just want one line from that mess
[13:48:04] <DaveMethvin> i'd be tempted to copy/pasta it and then commit with his name
[13:48:24] <DaveMethvin> committing other people's code is hard
[13:48:46] <jaubourg> yeah, that's what I should do... that and using the unit tests I made that doesn't require a new php script
[13:49:04] <DaveMethvin> that sounds like the winner
[13:49:20] <jaubourg> which reminds me that I seriously need to rationalize the php scripts we have
[13:49:48] <DaveMethvin> it would be great if we could simplify that, yes
[13:49:49] <jaubourg> also, any reason why testinit.js and testrunner.js are buried in test/data rather than in the root test directory?.
[13:49:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah!
[13:49:55] <jaubourg> that always puzzled me
[13:49:58] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[13:50:11] <DaveMethvin> i mean, they are data, KINDA
[13:50:17] <DaveMethvin> like what is program and what is data, really?
[13:50:24] <jaubourg> like we could put them in the main directory and call them init.js and runner.js for great justice
[13:50:34] * DaveMethvin exceeds philosophical quota for today
[13:50:42] <jaubourg> lol
[13:50:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah, let's save that for another day tho
[13:51:04] <DaveMethvin> that's all sock drawer stuff
[13:51:38] <DaveMethvin> like, some days i wake up and think, "what can i do to avoid doing whatever i shoudl really be doing? i know, i'll rearrange my socks"
[13:52:12] <jaubourg> haha... yes and no, this all test directory organization always puzzled me
[13:52:46] <DaveMethvin> brb
[13:59:02] <DaveMethvin> back
[14:08:53] <jaubourg> wb
[15:10:26] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: FYI, the size of the "simple" patch is 17 bytes for this method/type aliasing thingy
[15:10:32] <jaubourg> about to commit

[15:19:22] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: ^^ 
[15:19:55] <DaveMethvin> yay!  thanks
[15:20:10] <jaubourg> I even faked the guy's name with --author ;)
[15:20:28] <jaubourg> anyway, the final patch is +17 min-gzip
[15:20:35] <DaveMethvin> poor guy, a lot of work for 1 line of code
[15:20:51] <DaveMethvin> it's always more complicated than you think
[15:22:01] <jaubourg> yep
[15:23:01] <jaubourg> oh and done from the ipad(tm)
[15:29:36] <Dr4g> jaubourg: impressive! :D
