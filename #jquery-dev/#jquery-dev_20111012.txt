[07:06:38] <gnarf> anyone else here using browserstack btw?
[07:06:52] <gnarf> i was trying out the demo for a bit, and it seems pretty darn awesome
[07:07:00] <gnarf> pre-built VM's with dev tools and what not
[07:11:14] <aaronmcadam> it's a bit slow on my linux machine
[07:11:19] <aaronmcadam> that's more to do with java
[07:11:24] <aaronmcadam> but haven't tried it since it went flash

[07:36:42] <timmywil> nice
[07:36:57] <gnarf> figured those links might come in handy
[07:47:29] <gnarf> jzaefferer: seems the ajax module was missing from the swarm
[07:47:31] <gnarf> just added it

[07:53:37] <gnarf> hrm
[07:53:39] <gnarf> im not sure why
[07:53:51] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery/3ad0ba62f03ff3d7aec7d3dfb25492cdf33350a7/test/unit/ajax.js seems to still have the "functionunction"
[07:53:59] <gnarf> even tho its not in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/ajax.js
[07:59:19] <gnarf> aha - fixed
[07:59:28] <gnarf> seems that some local change was stoping a checkout of the SHA
[07:59:40] <gnarf> now doing a reset before checkout to stop that from happening
[08:01:45] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #119: STILL FAILING in 3 min 20 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/119/
[08:03:21] <gnarf> i don't trust that SHA anymore in swarm
[08:03:24] <gnarf> because it was corrupted
[08:03:31] <gnarf> we need to push something :)
[08:11:17] <jzaefferer> I'm gonna reset after merging Scott's patch for Firefox 7
[08:11:18] <bot-t> (13 hours 30 mins ago) <gnarf> tell jzaefferer can you maybe put some links to setting up "hub" in the http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40154555/Pull-Requests remote repo section?
[08:12:37] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yeah, need to publish my github-bash-tools post...

[08:38:03] <gnarf> we need to push something
[10:04:02] <meinmkv> hopefully quick question on a JSON response from $.ajax
[10:04:51] <meinmkv> im getting a valid JSON response
[10:05:02] <meinmkv> in responseText from $.ajax
[10:05:36] <meinmkv> but any attempts to use the data are looked at as a string
[10:06:30] <meinmkv> so if im trying to loop on index, it returns the char index instead of the item count in the collection
[10:06:51] <meinmkv> tried using $parseJSON but i get the same result.
[10:08:44] <kborchers> meinmkv: this channel is for discussing the development of jQuery. For support, please go to #jquery
[10:09:06] <meinmkv> aite - thanks

[15:54:46] <DaveMethvin> OH NOES! Github rearranged the furniture again!
[16:02:27] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: yeah, just noticed it
[16:02:27] <Krinkle> only small changes though (depending on when you last checked). last month they changed stuff too
[16:02:58] <DaveMethvin> some of it doesn't work that well for a big project like jQuery, such as the graph
[16:03:07] <Krinkle> the change from last month also involvement the commit-message header box.
[16:03:07] <Krinkle> the first line is now bolded and bigger and half-way cut off into â€¦ and then it continues on the next line with ...
[16:03:07] <Krinkle> sometimes it goes like <big>Foo bar baâ€¦</big><br/><small><em>z quux</em></small> (visually speaking)
[16:03:07] <Krinkle> annoying!
[16:04:19] <DaveMethvin> that commit message thing has definitely taken some getting used to
[16:04:33] <DaveMethvin> really need just a few words on the first line of the commit msg
[16:04:48] <DaveMethvin> it's annoying when it breaks
[16:17:27] <wwalser> jzaefferer: hey, did I introduce a global variable somewhere?
[16:18:24] <jzaefferer> wwalser: yep, within the test code, nothing serious
[16:19:17] <wwalser> what was the ?noglobals thing you wanted to tell me to use?
[16:19:26] <jzaefferer> its a checkbox in the header
[16:19:32] <wwalser> Ah, okay
[16:19:37] <jzaefferer> sets ?noglobals=true
[16:19:42] <jzaefferer> it'll check for globals...
[16:20:02] <jzaefferer> I wonder if there is actually any reason for not enabling that by default...
[16:20:51] <wwalser> would probably break stuff for a lot of people
[16:20:59] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: does .filter("[type='text']") by now match an input without a type attribute? related to that: https://github.com/jzaefferer/jquery-validation/issues/227
[16:21:00] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #227 on jquery-validation, reported by jjabba (18m, 24s ago): Input element without 'type' attribute is never verified on focus events.
[16:21:41] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: i don't think querySelectorAll matches that unless there is an explicit type
[16:22:14] <jzaefferer> okay, then I guess it was some other code where you fixed this
[16:22:20] <jzaefferer> maybe .attr("type")?
[16:22:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah i remember we fixed something like that, but let me create a test case to be sure
[16:25:16] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: http://jsfiddle.net/dmethvin/uEyhf/
[16:25:32] <DaveMethvin> people need to not be lazy, nothing we can do about qSA
[16:27:05] <jzaefferer> would be good if html5 required type=text to match the qSA behaviour
[16:27:21] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[16:27:45] <DaveMethvin> the whole props vs attrs thing is going to haunt us forever, thanks to the qSA semantics
[16:28:57] <jzaefferer> bah: "The missing value default is the http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/states-of-the-type-attribute.html#text-state-and-search-state state." http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/the-input-element.html#dom-input-type
[16:29:50] <jzaefferer> thanks for checking
[16:30:02] <jzaefferer> closed the ticket, let's see if he accepts my reasoning
[16:30:15] <DaveMethvin> haha, are you kidding? this is the internets!
[16:30:36] <jzaefferer> I didn't explicitly blame you :p
[16:31:22] <DaveMethvin> "dave says your code sux"
[16:44:51] <mikesherov> ...
[16:46:25] <mikesherov> jsperf.com still down!
[16:51:36] <miketaylr> mikesherov: WFM
[16:51:56] <mikesherov> hmm
[16:52:55] <mikesherov> gnarf, you here?
[17:17:22] <necromancer> haha check out this funny ass picture http://i.imgur.com/XIaWn.jpg
[17:17:29] <necromancer> ^^ pro click zone
[17:17:42] <necromancer> oh crap wrong channel sorry guys :)
[17:59:51] <mikesherov> gnarf!
[18:00:44] <gnarf> sup mikesherov
[18:01:04] <mikesherov> figured it out
[18:01:10] <mikesherov> our perf issue
[18:01:23] <gnarf> yes?
[18:01:38] <mikesherov> so in your rewrite, you accidentally were caching the transformed propName
[18:02:20] <gnarf> that made the perf worse? i would of thought better....
[18:02:34] <mikesherov> no, look at my fix
[18:02:36] <mikesherov> https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/commit/2f471cc1ff069de903107743458d443083a164a4
[18:02:37] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by mikesherov (3m, 9s ago): fixes to properly cache transformed names introduced from gnarf's rewritedirectly pass along elem.style to propName
[18:03:13] <gnarf> ahhh
[18:03:15] <gnarf> i see what you mean
[18:03:16] <gnarf> :)
[18:03:41] <gnarf> did you make a new build and push it up and update the perf?
[18:03:54] <mikesherov> yeah
[18:04:01] <mikesherov> http://jsperf.com/cssprops/2
[18:04:13] <mikesherov> all the patched2 stuff is me
[18:04:31] <mikesherov> also discovered JSLitmus perf testing
[18:04:57] <mikesherov> nice little library: http://broofa.com/Tools/JSLitmus/
[18:06:49] <gnarf> mikesherov: leaving my result in the perf is kinda pointless at this point - feel free to pull it out :)
[18:06:59] <mikesherov> No problem
[18:07:07] <mikesherov> What should I do with the perf?
[18:07:16] <mikesherov> should I add it to the ticket?
[18:07:24] <gnarf> or the pull, yah
[18:07:29] <mikesherov> OK
[18:13:42] <mikesherov> so, OK, I updated
[18:13:58] <mikesherov> So now I have the million dollar question
[18:14:24] <mikesherov> I can base some other fixes off this PR, wondering if I should do that or not...
[18:25:03] <gnarf> mikesherov: like using this as a base, you can fix other things?
[18:25:14] <gnarf> or like unrelated issues?
[18:25:24] <gnarf> bah
[19:13:52] <tbranyen> jzaefferer: you're killing me man xD
[19:14:21] <tbranyen> did jQuery 1.4.4 have a ready function bug that caused it to trigger multiple times with hash related stuff?
[19:15:05] <DaveMethvin> doesn't sound familiar to me
[19:15:19] <tbranyen> I'm trying to figure out if this Backbone issue is really Backbone or jQuery :-/
[19:15:25] <tbranyen> Or just really poorly coded coders
[19:16:49] <tbranyen> oh shit he's using an old backbone >_> issue is probably fixed in latest
[19:28:28] <tbranyen> wish it was easier to rip out the deep copy stuff from jquery, looking for an efficient implementation
[19:28:31] <tbranyen> gonna have to just grab the whole thing
[19:28:36] <tbranyen> extend, that is
