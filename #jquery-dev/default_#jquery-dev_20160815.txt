[06:30:35] <TimLoal> DaveMethvin i'm an experianced developer trying to learn a new technology, from a base of using JS and JQ, not to much of a learning curve on paper
[06:34:46] <TimLoal> I've been unable to get 100% from the official documentation, which is further diluted with many bad and outdated tutorials in html and video
[06:36:35] <TimLoal> i am able to and do help others in this channel, i am not here for a free ride expecting someone else to do it for me 
[06:37:16] <TimLoal> I was asking if ...
[06:38:06] <TimLoal> does someone have some time to help me progress a UI widget i'm building and to clarify my understanding https://jsfiddle.net/azstkbe4/
[06:38:37] <TimLoal> I'm currently looking at improving construction adding for each and passing the element as a parameter and attaching instance data to the dom
[06:41:03] <TimLoal> considdering i'm comming from a point of confusion in these areas specific confused question would be equally unhelpful
[06:43:55] <TimLoal> I was as i say looking to discuss my widget, which works, for as much as is currently built 
[06:45:59] <TimLoal> There was some confusion due to not being familure with jsfiddle: whilst i could refresh the page and my changes were preserved, they were not for others
[06:47:24] <TimLoal> changes that I made on request, to make things easier for Shoky, although what i wanted to discuss only required looking at specific areas at the top of the script
[06:48:32] <TimLoal> He then discribed my code as shit and 150 lines as tons of code
[06:53:41] <TimLoal> this is not the way either a professional or someone trying to help talks and so i took my ques and thanked him for his help
[06:56:28] <TimLoal> its a pitty, because this seems a great technology and I would have done a great deal with it and given much of it back to the universe
[07:00:05] <TimLoal> but if this is all i can get from a request for a conversation in a chat room dedicated to jquery with 500+ participants and documentation that doesn't even contain a diagram of the object model
[07:01:59] <TimLoal> then IMO its not a tecnology that should be invested in or relied upon
[07:12:38] <TimLoal_> this is not the sprit I'd expect from a champion of openness and advancement of technology
[07:13:11] <TimLoal_> surely the more people that know it the more people will use it, which is good for everyone
[07:14:02] <TimLoal_> and the more people who know it well the better the plugins will be, also good for everyone
[07:16:32] <TimLoal_> all of this would feed back into making jQuery core better
[07:17:37] <TimLoal_> so some 'free' help to fill in a few gaps for someone who is 90% there under his own steam, is helping the jquery project and everyone who benefits from it, not just one indavidual 
[07:21:03] <TimLoal_> with a solid understanding of the technology i would make a suite of great plugins, which i will try to gain now through a good book or two 
[07:22:49] <TimLoal_> when it comes to publishing them i will take my ques from the generosity of support in learning this open free technology and be equally generous
