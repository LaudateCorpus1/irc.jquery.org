[07:26:41] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jqueryui: jQuery UI 1.8.18 is out: http://t.co/uDw4ZT4W Scott doing all magic! Tons of bugfixes! ★ http://bit.ly/zvmda2
[08:37:05] <Mithaldu`> hey is the bug tracker currently broken? i tried to submit a bug from two ips now, from machines 500km apart and in both cases it claimed my ips were spamming, additionally after entering the captcha it would just display the rejection message and a link to tracguide
[08:37:45] <ajpiano> we have a really bad spam problem on there, it seems to be a little overzealous
[08:37:47] <ajpiano> is this on core or ui
[08:37:54] <Mithaldu`> core, ajax
[08:38:08] <Mithaldu`> i can dump it on gist and let you submit it if you'd like
[08:38:19] <ajpiano> i can give it a once over to see if it's a bug :p
[08:38:25] <Mithaldu`> sure
[08:38:59] <Mithaldu`> ajpiano: here you go: https://gist.github.com/1901919
[08:40:54] <ajpiano> Mithaldu`: do you have an account?
[08:41:00] <Mithaldu`> no
[08:41:05] <Mithaldu`> should i make one?
[08:41:45] <ajpiano> Mithaldu`: oh lol i'm looking at it now i see it caught in the rejection
[08:41:48] <ajpiano> filtering
[08:42:02] <ajpiano> it started rejecting you because you were posting so much from the same IP :|
[08:42:08] <Mithaldu`> um
[08:42:17] <Mithaldu`> i posted from 2 different ips
[08:42:19] <ajpiano> Mithaldu`: an account would help
[08:42:20] <Mithaldu`> one in the office
[08:42:30] <Mithaldu`> where i did a preview 4 times and then a submit
[08:42:37] <Mithaldu`> on the very first submit it blocked me
[08:42:46] <Mithaldu`> maybe other other people in the office did shit, but i didn
[08:42:58] <Mithaldu`> and subsequently from a machine 500km away at the coast, i tried too
[08:43:00] <ajpiano> hm, yea also trac is saying the ip is 127.0.0.1 so there is obv something wonky
[08:43:06] <Mithaldu`> oh
[08:43:07] <Mithaldu`> hahaha
[08:43:22] <Mithaldu`> i think our squid proxy is a bit weird :)
[08:43:29] <ajpiano> heh
[08:43:45] <ajpiano> Mithaldu`: i would say to register an account and maybe give it an hour our and then repost
[08:43:55] <Mithaldu`> :effort:
[08:43:58] <Mithaldu`> issue is solved for me
[08:43:59] <ajpiano> i can also say that everyoen who triages tickets will instantly ask for a jsfiddle test case to prove the behaviour
[08:44:06] <Mithaldu`> i only want you to be aware of the issue
[08:44:15] <Mithaldu`> i'll register and if i can't post it now, you have the text
[08:44:17] <ajpiano> yes, appreciate that
[08:44:24] <ajpiano> thanks
[08:44:39] <Mithaldu`> (it's 6 in the evening here ;))
[08:44:47] <ajpiano> hehe ok :)
[08:46:52] <Mithaldu`> ajpiano: still blocking me
[08:47:18] <ajpiano> sorry
[08:47:45] <Mithaldu`> so, i'd suggest you jsut go ahead and post it
[08:47:49] <ajpiano> bot-t: tell jaubourg can you give this a once-over and see if it actually seems like something we should fix
[08:47:49] <bot-t> ajpiano, Okay.
[08:47:55] <ajpiano> bot-t: tell jaubourg https://gist.github.com/1901919
[08:47:56] <bot-t> ajpiano, Okay.
[08:48:13] <Mithaldu`> i'll be hanging out here over the weekend, so feel free to highlight whenever
[08:49:31] <ajpiano> alrighty
[08:51:14] <ch3mical> ajpiano, as it turns out the problem I was having yesterday with animate is not resolvable by using a promise on the animate itself rather than manually building my deferreds
[08:52:09] <ch3mical> This is due to the facts that queue:false, while this does interrupt the previous animation, the "done" callback on the promise is still fired, even though the animation didn't technically happen
[08:52:18] <ch3mical> Or at least not to completion
[08:52:27] <ajpiano> ah
[08:53:25] <ch3mical> I was wondering if it would be useful to change that behavior in jQuery such that it treats queue:false interruptions more like a reject on the deferred
[08:53:43] <ajpiano> i can't say really, you'd have to talk to gnarf or someone else about that
[08:53:44] <ch3mical> I glanced at the source, but didn't see deferreds being used (not directly) in animate at all, though
[08:53:53] <ch3mical> Ok, no worries
[08:53:58] <ch3mical> Just bouncing ideas around
[10:34:57] <gnarf> ch3mical: .fn.promise() has never worked like i thought it should
[10:34:58] <bot-t> (2 hours 15 mins ago) <djQuery> tell gnarf seem to be having a problem with newContent. do I have to manualy call it when something is added to the dom? http://jsbin.com/acojev/edit#javascript,html,live
[10:35:30] <ch3mical> gnarf, I share your sentiment
[10:36:28] <ch3mical> But the problem is also present even when you're not using the promise
[10:36:56] <gnarf> queue: false animations that override each other don't get "terminated"
[10:37:00] <gnarf> its just that the second one wins
[10:37:04] <gnarf> its actually double animating
[10:37:17] <gnarf> but because the second one happens after, you only "see" the second one
[10:37:22] <ch3mical> That's what I mean, it seems like it should behave more like a proper deferred
[10:38:02] <ch3mical> So that when you want to chain more than one animation you can stop any further up the chain if one before it gets overridden
[10:38:11] <ch3mical> It's kind of messy :/
[10:41:31] <ch3mical> If you can recommend a work around other than manually creating deferreds, I'm all ears :)
