[01:19:58] <papysmrf> hey all, hey all, The PCI counsel's standards no longer include SSL (protocol) and things are moving more to TLS. With regard to Heroku, their documentation refers to SSL (HTTPS) still and I'm wondering if they are actually using TLS? Do I need to set the SSLContext and mess with the version?
[04:12:04] <frantic1048> Just submitted my draft proposal for GSoC - QUnit: Standard Reporter Interface, I'd appreciate to any comment given :)

[10:29:28] <snover> m_gol: sorry, i donâ€™t know what the manual verification process is intended to be. hopefully DaveMethvin or scott_gonzalez knows, and then we can all learn together :)
[10:29:40] <snover> i think it means you just commit the code :P

[10:54:13] <snover> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-dist/pull/3#issuecomment-196801283 this question
[10:56:07] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, so you have edit access to the CLA signatures.
[10:56:25] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have the link for the doc?
[10:56:44] <snover> i do
[10:56:55] <snover> i do not have edit access
[10:57:05] <snover> that was confusing
[10:57:10] <snover> i have the link, no edit access
[10:57:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, indeed. Well, now you have edit.
[10:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> To manually approve a name, just enter a short description of why in the "Name Confirmation" field.
[11:00:01] <scott_gonzalez> In this case, I'd just copy the value from PhistucK: "acceptable pseudonym; does not use real name on Internet"
[11:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> Though it's a bit strange because he does use his real name on the Internet. It's even in his GitHub profile.
[11:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> And obvious from his email address.
