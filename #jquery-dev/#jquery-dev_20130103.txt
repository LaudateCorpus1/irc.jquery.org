[18:41:18] <gibson042> hey DaveMethvin do we actually have a git build of 1.9? jquery-migrate is all kinds of messed up on 2.0
[18:41:49] <DaveMethvin> no we don't have one atm, that's one of the things I need to sort out
[18:42:00] <DaveMethvin> i noticed a problem as well
[18:42:18] <DaveMethvin> is it the ".apply to a nodelist" error?
[18:42:23] <gibson042> yeah
[18:42:26] <DaveMethvin> and where the heck is that coming from?
[18:42:39] <DaveMethvin> i noticed that yesterday and coudln't figure it out
[18:42:53] <DaveMethvin> it runs fine in real browsers
[18:43:02] <gibson042> one of our 2.0 optimizations was to drop a bunch of makeArrays since NodeLists are recognized as suitably array-like in our supported browsers
[18:43:17] <DaveMethvin> (groan)
[18:43:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah i thought it might be
[18:43:35] <DaveMethvin> oldIE didn't like it, now why doesn't phantomJS?
[18:43:43] <DaveMethvin> it's Chrome isn't it?
[18:43:49] <DaveMethvin> maybe an old Chrome
[18:44:47] <darcyclarke> anyone know where I can get the RSS feed for the query blog

[18:47:29] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: what version of phantomjs do you have? I'm on 1.5.1 and the web site says 1.8 was released december 12
[18:48:56] <gibson042> I'm even farther back; 1.4.0
[18:49:01] <DaveMethvin> haha
[18:49:23] <DaveMethvin> maybe an update will help us, i'm gonna try it
[18:49:44] <gibson042> but I think it might be overridden by the node module for these purposes

[20:13:01] <gibson042> you there, DaveMethvin?
[20:13:08] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: yep
[20:13:20] <gibson042> I'm looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues/2
[20:13:40] <gibson042> boolHook rollback (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/a763ae72775f69509d0a8a6b50702bcf2c7e6fbf) for jquery-migrate
[20:14:08] <DaveMethvin> ok
[20:14:55] <gibson042> it seems wrong to throw a warning whenever boolHook is used, but I don't know what the special cases would be when a warning would be helpful
[20:16:04] <gibson042> would it make sense to limit it to checked and selected? (the props for which IE needs default*)
[20:16:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was wondering if we could "cheat" a bit
[20:16:20] <DaveMethvin> but get the most common cases
[20:16:31] <DaveMethvin> that would be fine with me
[20:16:41] <gibson042> is there anything else you can think of?
[20:16:46] <DaveMethvin> disabled
[20:17:06] <DaveMethvin> nothing else offhand
[20:17:42] <gibson042> I think disabled didn't change (attribute/property always synchronized by browser)
[20:19:08] <gibson042> that should be enough to close out the issue, though
[20:19:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think so
[20:19:17] <gibson042> cool
[20:19:21] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[20:19:31] <DaveMethvin> i'm just about ready to bail out for the night
[20:19:53] <snover> DaveMethvin: but iâm here now
[20:19:57] <snover> surely you want to stay
[20:20:06] <DaveMethvin> all night long snover
[20:20:12] <snover> weâre gonna celebrate
[20:20:48] <DaveMethvin> i can celebrate that we finally got a successful test run
[20:26:33] <snover> nice!
[20:26:48] <snover> just in time to get all cosy with teststack
[20:26:53] <snover> i gotta find a new name for this thing
[20:27:26] <DaveMethvin> well  you came up with jquery-migrate so i know you have some good names in  you
[20:27:47] <gibson042> yeah, snover's naming my next child
[20:27:58] <DaveMethvin> haha
[20:29:05] <snover> I was thinking Jane, to go with Travis, though I have no idea how the two are related. As an upside, it works as a bad acronym, Just Another Neat Experiment
[20:29:45] <DaveMethvin> alrighty,gotta go
[20:29:56] <snover> thatâs not useful feedback, you person
[20:29:58] <snover> good bye!
