[03:24:54] <daleharvey> So jQuery.isPlainObject({constructor: 'hello'}); throws an error due to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L230
[03:25:17] <daleharvey> is this a known bug, anyone familiar around that area?
[03:26:33] <daleharvey> I am not smart enough to know what !hasOwn.call( obj.constructor.prototype, "isPrototypeOf" ) is testing for

[07:42:38] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ping
[08:10:02] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: what'sup
[08:10:31] <timmywil> I'll be on the Web Platform Podcast today talking about jQuery 3.0 and the jQuery Foundation.
[08:10:43] <timmywil> which site do you use for jQuery usage statistics?
[08:10:49] <DaveMethvin> builtwith.com
[08:11:02] <timmywil> ok, that's the one I picked
[08:11:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah, we're still pretty popular http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/jQuery
[08:11:27] <timmywil> heh
[08:12:32] <DaveMethvin> vs http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/Angular-JS and http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/Ember or http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/Backbone.js :)
[08:13:54] <timmywil> wow, didn't see those
[08:14:19] <DaveMethvin> frameworks are a lot more common for apps than they are for web sites i guess, which makes sense
[08:14:27] <DaveMethvin> either that or their detection algs suck~
[08:15:57] <timmywil> they might only be testing homepages too
[08:16:09] <timmywil> and often the app is behind auth
[08:16:42] <timmywil> but we could look at http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/Dojo-Toolkit
[08:16:55] <timmywil> and http://trends.builtwith.com/javascript/Prototype
[08:17:55] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: anything you'd like me to bring up during the podcast?
[08:18:01] <timmywil> about the foundation or otherwise
[08:18:35] <DaveMethvin> you could mention our merge with the dojo foundation and how we want to become a place for javascript projects of all kinds
[08:19:15] <timmywil> yup
[08:19:24] <timmywil> also talking about the summit
[08:19:30] <DaveMethvin> definitely
