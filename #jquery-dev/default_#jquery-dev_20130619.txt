[07:46:46] <ajpiano> we deprecated :checkbox and :radio ?
[07:46:55] <ajpiano> i thought we just strongly discouraged them
[11:50:20] <Krinkle> #jquerymobile-dev is invite-only now? My bouncer won't let me in.
[11:50:27] <Krinkle> I have it in auto-join
[11:50:36] <Krinkle> > Error(473): #jquerymobile-dev Cannot join channel (+i) - you must be invited
[11:50:50] <arschmitz> Krinkle: it is merged with #jquery-ui
[11:51:12] <arschmitz> Krinkle: it should auto forward you to #jquery-ui
[11:51:24] <Krinkle> I'm already in there so I wouldn't see.
[11:51:45] <arschmitz> ok
[11:51:55] <Krinkle> I'm all for less channels, just wondering how this was decided.
[11:52:10] * Krinkle removes it from auto-join
[11:52:12] <arschmitz> was decided last week in portland
[11:52:24] <Krinkle> k
[11:52:28] <arschmitz> kinda first step toward integration between the teams
[12:15:03] <SlexAxton> i can confirm
[14:39:32] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15terrycojones opened pull request #1292: Move too-early assignment inside the if stmt where the var is actually used (06master...06fix-trivial-unneeded-args-calculation)  02http://git.io/Kl-qXA
[14:53:00] <terrycojones> as a start in contributing a tiny bit to jquery, i just got myself set up with php/grunt etc., and ran the test suite. i get one error (on master): "Iteration over document.styleSheets" 2 != 5 at http://localhost/jquery/test/unit/core.js:1173:2     I'm wondering if that's normal & I can ignore it?  I'm running on a mac, os x 10.8.3 with chrome 27.0.1453.93 hitting a local apache2 server.   no errors appear in the JS console when 
[14:53:01] <terrycojones> failing test.
[15:41:03] <terrycojones> gibson042: just replied to you re https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1292    see above ^^^^ comment/question re error in the test suite?  i get it on master, so i'm sure i didn't introduce it. thx for the review!
[15:44:39] <gibson042> terrycojones: you should see the size effects every time you run grunt, because grunt_compare_size is the last step in the process
[15:44:56] <gibson042> and yes, your change shrinks the relevant file by 2 bytes
[15:45:17] <gibson042> but that test failure is not expected
[15:46:28] <terrycojones> gibson042: ok, thanks (re size).  i once had a client (Siemens) call up to see if we couldn't shrink a compile (C code) result by 2 bytes :-)
[15:47:00] <gibson042> heh
[15:47:46] <gibson042> as for the failure, the fact that you see *more* stylesheets than expected makes me wonder if you have extensions modifying the page
[15:48:06] <terrycojones> ah shit, yes i should disable extensions.  sorry / thanks.
[15:48:52] <terrycojones> ok, that's looking better.
[15:49:55] <terrycojones> gibson042: 6650 assertions of 6650 passed, 0 failed.
[15:50:02] <gibson042> :D
[15:50:08] <gibson042> fantastic
[15:51:32] <terrycojones> tests all pass on the branch in the pull request too.

[16:18:53] <jqcommit> 13jquery/061.x-master 14cafd88e 15terrycojones: Moved too-early assignment inside the if stmt where the var is actually used. Close gh-1292....
[16:19:41] <terrycojones> cool.   thanks gibson042 !
[16:19:45] <gibson042> thank you
[16:19:57] <gibson042> we look forward to more contributions
[16:20:08] <terrycojones> next time i'll try to do something with a bit more substance :-)
[16:20:31] <terrycojones> it was partly an exercise to get the build env set up, etc.
[16:22:12] <terrycojones> gibson042: i have a quick question - is eventual code size weighted heavily in jquery coding style?  i.e., other things being equal, sacrifice elegance or clarity to some extent in order to reduce download size.
[16:23:55] <gibson042> terrycojones: it's not a hard and fast rule, but generally yes
[16:24:26] <terrycojones> ok, thanks. that makes some of the code style make more sense :-)
[16:24:42] <gibson042> the ONLY size that matters is jquery.min.js.gz, but its size matters significantly enough that we make compromises (and add comments) to keep it small
[16:25:51] <terrycojones> thx

[22:26:40] * JamesMGreene submits his Expensify report
[22:26:45] <JamesMGreene> Expensify is so awesome....
[22:31:25] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: their mobile treatment not so much...
[22:31:52] <m_gol> I wanted to do sth from an iPhone so I clicked on a link and I obviously saw a big screen inviting me to their fucking app
[22:32:09] <m_gol> and when I clicked no, it redirected me to the login site - so far so good
[22:32:19] <m_gol> but when I tried to log in, the same popup!
[22:32:26] <m_gol> and clicking no points to the login site again
[22:32:30] <JamesMGreene> Eh, them and every other website
[22:32:49] <m_gol> so I couldn't do anything in the browser, unfortunately
[22:32:49] <JamesMGreene> On the other hand, their mobile app for Android was great
[22:32:54] <m_gol> yeah, I so hate that trend
[22:32:58] <JamesMGreene> So nice to just snap a photo of the receipts, etc.
[22:33:09] <m_gol> Google said they'd lower rankings of such sites
[22:33:18] <m_gol> wonder if they lower their Google+ site ranking :P
[22:33:29] <JamesMGreene> That would be interesting
[22:33:32] <JamesMGreene> lol
