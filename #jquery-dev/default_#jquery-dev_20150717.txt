[08:14:11] <robbygwdd> Hey. There doesn't seem to be much content on best practices about how to create plugins for QUnit. Should I open a ticket somewhere?

[12:05:49] <m_gol> Krinkle: ping
[12:06:36] <Krinkle> m_gol: pong
[12:06:48] <m_gol> Krinkle: Edge is not spawned for some reason: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/937
[12:08:23] <m_gol> Krinkle: my first (blind) guess is ua-parser recognizes it as Edge 12.0 - BrowserStack has an old Edge build, still marked as Spartan that has "Edge/12.0" in its user agent - wherease BrowserStack reports Edge version as 0.11
[12:08:42] <Krinkle> m_gol: checking
[12:09:07] <Krinkle> m_gol: Can you check testswarm-browserstack log?
[12:09:29] <m_gol> no errors, like nothing needed to be done
[12:09:34] <m_gol> action=info {"message":"Neediness exhausted, done!"}
[12:09:39] <m_gol> action=summary {"data":{}}
[12:09:44] <m_gol> and that many times
[12:10:08] <Krinkle> m_gol: Working fine here
[12:10:11] <m_gol> (I now restarted a couple of Android failures so it has Android info as well but that was what was there before I restarted there)
[12:10:24] <m_gol> did you join the swarm manually now?
[12:10:53] <Krinkle> Yes
[12:11:02] <Krinkle> http://i.imgur.com/XXLmAZ3.png
[12:11:03] <m_gol> so it's just not spawned but it works when joined manually
[12:11:19] <Krinkle> that means it's the userAgent profile in testswarm not being mapped to a browserStack worker
[12:11:33] <m_gol> can it be that it's because of version mismatch?
[12:11:36] <Krinkle> What does the browserstack api use for Edge?
[12:11:39] <Krinkle> There is no version, right?
[12:11:42] <m_gol> there is
[12:11:43] <m_gol> 0.11
[12:11:44] <Krinkle> Or did you add one?
[12:11:46] <m_gol> I wrote that above :)
[12:11:48] <m_gol> ah, me
[12:11:49] <Krinkle> No, I mean on our side
[12:11:54] <m_gol> no, I put nothing there
[12:12:11] <Krinkle> we don't specify "os: Windows 7" either, but Chrome 43 will  match "Chrome 43 / os 7"
[12:12:22] <Krinkle> our match is always a subset. 
[12:12:24] <m_gol> just `"edge": {"browserFamily": "Edge"}`
[12:12:57] <Krinkle> so it will look for browserstack workers that match all given properties. Can be very specific (browser name, major, minor, os name, major, device) or very generic (e.g. "Chrome", or "Edge")
[12:13:16] <Krinkle> m_gol: And what does the browserstack API use?
[12:13:18] <m_gol> it lowercases the browser family?
[12:13:24] <Krinkle> the browsers list
[12:13:27] <Krinkle> it's case insensitive
[12:14:28] <m_gol> in the JSON from the BrowserStack API under Windows[10] one array entry is {"browser_version": "0.11", "browser": "edge"}
[12:14:54] <m_gol> do we have a mapping? we specify e.g. "browserFamily": "IE" but in the api "browser" is "ie"
[12:15:16] <Krinkle> It's case insensitive
[12:15:22] <m_gol> ah, right
[12:15:25] <Krinkle> We only map when it's different
[12:15:37] <Krinkle> Hm..

[12:35:42] <m_gol> Krinkle: do you know where to look for potential problems? somewhere in https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack/blob/master/src/testswarm-browserstack.js?
[12:36:56] <Krinkle> m_gol: I'd look in splunk (or on the server) at testswarm-browstack log to see why it isn't finding a match
[12:37:55] <m_gol> Krinkle: you're not talking about /var/log/testswarm-browserstack/cli.log?
[12:38:01] <Krinkle> I am
[12:38:09] <m_gol> nothing related to Edge appears there
[12:38:36] <m_gol> it thinks no new requests are coming
[12:49:41] <m_gol> Krinkle: what should I see in the logs for non-matched browsers? the only logs that mention any browsers are action=spawn where it has already been matched
[12:53:07] <robbygwdd> Random idea: somebody should really build a yeoman generator or Qunit plugins. I developed one (actually, two) today and it wasn't too easy... And docs, that too.
[12:53:24] <robbygwdd> can somebody cc me the QUnit people? Or should I be in another channel?
[12:56:13] <m_gol> robbygwdd: hmm, I don't think QUnit has a dedicated channel, at least nothing is mentioned at http://irc.jquery.org/. jzaefferer, leobalter, Krinkle, JamesMGreene are a couple of people
[13:00:58] <leobalter> robbygwdd we have a plugins page here: http://qunitjs.com/plugins/
[13:01:16] <leobalter> repo: https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/
[13:01:30] <robbygwdd> leobalter: yes, I do know that, but that's not the same as documentation how to build plugins.
[13:01:38] <Krinkle> Yeah, qunit can be discussed here :)
[13:01:43] <leobalter> I never used yeoman, or I used only 1 or 2 times, just to see how it works
[13:02:54] <robbygwdd> oh but I wasn't really talking about yeoman in specific I just think there are some general workflow things lacking
[13:03:21] <arthurvr> Just use generator-jquery, you can the whole setup for free just need to replace the dependencies and the links in the test html page
[13:03:31] <arthurvr> I believe we have a ticket about docs, by the way
[13:03:33] <arthurvr> one minute
[13:03:48] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/issues/100
[13:04:46] <robbygwdd> thanks for the tip. Docs are the biggest missing factor though
