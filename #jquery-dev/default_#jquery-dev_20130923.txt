[04:24:11] <jdfm> hey all
[04:24:58] <jdfm> question, why is insertAdjacentHTML not being used in jquery appending or prepending html?
[04:25:07] <jdfm> *for appending...
[04:25:27] <jdfm> I read the article that resig wrote here: http://ejohn.org/blog/dom-insertadjacenthtml/
[04:26:35] <jdfm> but given that jqueryv2 no longer supports versions of IE below 9, is it really such a problem anymore?
[04:27:28] <jdfm> is there some other drawback to using insertAdjacentHTML beyond what was described in resig's post?

[09:34:29] <m_gol> sorry, not orkel but markelog ;)
[09:36:04] <markelog> m_gol: i'm here and silently watching you guys :-)
[09:36:14] <m_gol> :)
[09:36:29] <m_gol> markelog: you landed the optimizations pr, right?
[09:36:39] <markelog> yep
[09:37:02] <markelog> only prs not pr
[09:37:46] <markelog> i will make another commit, for focus issue of ie8
[09:38:11] <m_gol> ok :)
[09:40:15] <m_gol> markelog, how is 12757 going?
[09:40:26] <m_gol> automating checking for code style issues
[09:41:06] <markelog> it's ready, for some time know
[09:41:24] <markelog> but i forgot when i should present the pr, after 2.1 or after 2.1 beta
[09:41:42] <markelog> will talk to Dave about that
[09:42:38] <m_gol> Dave wrote that after a beta
[09:42:45] <m_gol> that's in the agenda docs from last week
[09:43:21] <markelog> yeah, i see know, will do it tomorrow
[09:43:51] <markelog> man, my english is horrible :-(
[09:44:40] <m_gol> who can add iOS browsers to TestSwarm? :)
[09:44:44] <m_gol> that one should be simple
[09:45:50] <markelog> Krinkle usually do this kind of stuff
[09:46:58] <m_gol> `tell Krinkle can you add iOS 5.1, 6.1 & 7.0 to TestSwarm? Or maybe without the last one if it's not available on BrowserStack yet
[09:46:59] <b-ot> m_gol: Iâ€™ll tell Krinkle about that.
[09:47:40] <Krinkle> Needs support in BrowserStack and testswarm-browserstack, then we can configure it in testswarm/localsettings.json
[09:47:40] <b-ot> Krinkle: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:47:43] <Krinkle> `read
[09:47:45] <b-ot> Krinkle: From m_gol, 44s ago: can you add iOS 5.1, 6.1 & 7.0 to TestSwarm? Or maybe without the last one if it's not available on BrowserStack yet
[09:48:05] <m_gol> ah, you're here
[09:48:18] <m_gol> we're discussing it on a meeting now, if you could pop in :)
[09:50:41] <m_gol> Krinkle: ping? :)

[09:53:26] <jqcommit> 13jquery/061.x-master 140b9a182 15Oleg: Run focus test only if document has focus
[09:56:25] <Krinkle> m_gol: Yes
[09:57:23] <m_gol> Krinkle: so what's exactly missing? BrowserStack does support at least iOS 5.1 & 6.sth
[09:57:32] <Krinkle> Yeah
[09:57:36] <Krinkle> I didn't say support was missing
[09:57:47] <Krinkle> just saying, there's a chain of things that need to be checked.
[09:57:50] <m_gol> 5.1 & 6.0, just checked
[09:57:57] <Krinkle> the lowest dependency is browserstack, but there's 3 layers on top that can break it
[09:57:58] <m_gol> no 6.1 & 7.0 unfortunately
[09:58:02] <m_gol> k, get it
[09:58:17] <Krinkle> node-browsetstack, (node) testswarm-browserstack, and ua-parser specifically
[09:58:22] <m_gol> how is our moving to Sauce Labs?
[10:00:05] <Krinkle> SauceLabs specifically is no longer a need since BrowserStack now supports the selenium API as well. The primary story around "testswarm to saucealabs" is a giant confusion. TestSwarm is a distributor, currently we are using BrowserStack's static HTTP workers to visit a page, and that's it.
[10:00:46] <Krinkle> We're interested in switching to a selenium-backed approach where we can extract the results directly from the javascript runtime (instead of just blinding pointing a vm at it)
[10:01:35] <Krinkle> So we're replacing testswarm with a grunt task, and having it connect to selenium workers instead of static http workers. those selenium workers can be both in suacelabs or browserstack, no matter :)
[10:02:20] <Krinkle> JÃ¶rn and I are slowly but surely getting a grip on (what is currently called) grunt-saucelabs.
[10:02:41] <markelog> Krinkle: I do remeber you were saying that browserstack browsers always has focus, but for IE8 it's not seems to be true â€“ http://swarm.jquery.org/result/879149
[10:03:06] <markelog> maybe something did changed on browserstack side?
[10:04:05] <Krinkle> Everytime they upgrade a vm, they re-build the virtual machine image. In doing so, the state before it gets paused and copied to an image is the state each clone will have. Every now and then a bug slips in.
[10:04:18] <Krinkle> I've reported it.
[10:05:02] <m_gol> Krinkle: great to hear it! one transition less is a win
[10:05:13] <m_gol> though moving to Selenium-based dispatch can be a big one
[10:05:48] <markelog> Krinkle: cool, can you ping when they will fix it, so we can revert https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/0b9a182ecde49adb508d76577e8f244da08a1e51 ?
[10:05:49] <b-ot> markelog: Oleg (15m 17s ago): Run focus test only if document has focus
[10:05:59] <Krinkle> Yeah. It's not entirely straight forward either. There's a lot of advantages that aren't technically required from our CI workflow that testswarm provides that we've grown to like.
[10:06:47] <Krinkle> .. that we will inherently lose when switching to a grunt and selenium based workflow.
[10:07:38] <m_gol> Krinkle: is there any way to follow your progress on this? I'd be interested to know where we are :)

[10:08:53] <doesallmagic2> markelog: Run focus test only if document has focus
[10:09:14] <Krinkle> m_gol: Not yet
[10:09:54] <Krinkle> m_gol: I can't reproduce the lack of focus in IE8 on browserstack.
[10:10:15] <Krinkle> It seems to be inconsistent in the past as well. Maybe it's not related browserstack
[10:10:41] <Krinkle> also, I'd recommend not disabling tests conditionally based on this. I'd rather have it fail for now so we know it's broken.

[10:11:08] <m_gol> Krinkle: might be related: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/879149
[10:12:41] <Krinkle> m_gol: that is the same failure?
[10:13:21] <Krinkle> Looking at http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery I see this test passed 3 days ago
[10:13:34] <Krinkle> failed 4 days ago, passed 6 days ago
[10:14:20] <m_gol> not sure
[10:14:25] <m_gol> markelog? ^^^
[10:14:54] <markelog> that's right, before it worked without any ifs now it's not
[10:18:53] <Krinkle> before, without any ifs, it sometimes worked and sometimes it didn't.
[10:19:01] <Krinkle> that is still the case

[10:19:23] <doesallmagic2> markelog: Run focus test only if document has focus
[10:19:25] <Krinkle> (if you remove the id)
[10:19:31] <Krinkle> if*
[10:19:53] <Krinkle> I can't consistently reproduce the failure when I test manually in browserstack, so the problem may be elsewhere
[11:19:00] <markelog> Krinkle: > that is still the case
[11:19:04] <markelog> what are you mean?
[11:19:45] <markelog> what do you mean?
[11:22:16] <Krinkle> markelog: I mean that the focus test was sometimes passing and sometimes failing in browserstack, it wasn't always failing.
[11:22:21] <Krinkle> that has been the case for the last 1-2 weeks
[11:22:33] <Krinkle> it didn't always fail, not earlier, not now.
[11:22:55] <Krinkle> (in IE 8)
[11:26:00] <markelog> so you saying it might be real bug?
[11:28:41] <markelog> when my IE is out of focus - test is consistently failing
[11:29:56] <markelog> when it is in focus - it's always pass
[11:32:17] <markelog> and it looks like that this fix has worked, so if it's not browserstack, then i don't know what might causing the problem
