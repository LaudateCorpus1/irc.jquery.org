[07:29:30] <cjwelborn> Which javascript compressor does the jquery team prefer (if any is preferred over the others)?
[11:37:26] <DaveMethvin> m_gol here now!
[11:46:52] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: just wanted to know how quick you wanted those fixes for beta.2 but since they weren't too big after all I've done it today ;)
[11:47:00] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[11:47:04] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[11:47:10] <DaveMethvin> just tryna catch up myself
[11:47:12] <m_gol> jaubourg wrote, though, that he's unavailable for a couple of days
[11:47:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah like two weeks
[11:47:28] <DaveMethvin> so we'll have to screw up ajax on our own!
[11:47:33] <m_gol> haha
[11:47:33] <DaveMethvin> i'm up to the job
[11:47:46] <m_gol> especially that we decided in Amsterdam that it should be rewritten ;)
[11:48:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah sounds like you guys had a good meeting
[11:48:43] <m_gol> the final point of the first day was when Julian quietly said "OK" :P
[11:49:13] <DaveMethvin> i am really looking forward to simpler  .xhr and .json apis or whatever
[11:49:55] <m_gol> I'm still puzzled about this whole promises battle
[11:50:16] <DaveMethvin> it's a philosophy thing on several points
[11:50:48] <DaveMethvin> but as far as i can tell the rest of the world has agreed on some things that don't match with our promises
[11:51:00] <DaveMethvin> although i still think there are some broken things there
[11:51:16] <DaveMethvin> the browser needs to support them to get it right
[11:51:48] <m_gol> so it seems once it's shipped we will change then to match the spec
[11:51:55] <m_gol> while preserving pipe
[11:51:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah ... somehow
[11:52:09] <m_gol> though that's a breaking change, obviously
[11:52:25] <DaveMethvin> seems kind of tricky, altho it will be easier if the new xhr/json apis support the new promise semantics 
[11:53:07] <m_gol> I'm not sure what the plan is about that
[11:53:34] <DaveMethvin> i am thinking we should get 1.11/2.1 out with our minor non-breaking changes
[11:53:42] <m_gol> well, 2.1/1.11 will be API-compatible with 2.0/1.10 to we get to break sth in 2.2/1.12, right? ;)
[11:53:57] <DaveMethvin> then the next version can have fancy stuff that may break things
[11:54:51] <m_gol> yeah, we need to keep fresh supply of dbrs ;)
[11:55:11] <DaveMethvin> api changes are always a great source of them
[12:20:46] <m_gol> the new Xcode download tab is so broken
[12:21:06] <m_gol> progress bars gets stuck, sometimes hovering over them resets them, wtf
[13:05:37] <m_gol> wow, IE7 is as slow to me in BrowserStack as Android emulators
[13:06:18] <DaveMethvin> i can't believe anyone still uses ie6/7 anymore, they are SOOOOOO slow
[13:06:39] <m_gol> but that makes me think we could test Android 2.3 automatically
[13:07:10] <m_gol> I thought it's way slower than anything else, but clearly IE6/7 are buddies in this regard...
[13:07:36] <DaveMethvin> i forget, wasn't there some issue where we tried that before?
[13:07:47] <m_gol> hmm, I thought it's only about speed
[13:08:02] <m_gol> and, obviously, about the fact we fail about 35 tests there currently :P
[13:08:35] <m_gol> I'm starting to think I should buy a cheap Android phone to test stuff like that, those emulators will kill me
[13:10:37] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: don't worry, IE7 is supported (on Vista) until April 11, 2017 ]:->
[13:10:47] <DaveMethvin> NOOOOOOO!
[13:10:50] <m_gol> IE8 until January 14, 2020
[13:11:13] <m_gol> ;)
[13:11:30] <DaveMethvin> there are cheap android 2.3 phones but it seems like a shame to buy them http://dx.com/p/cubot-c7-android-2-3-gsm-bar-phone-w-3-5-capacitive-screen-quad-band-and-wi-fi-deep-red-173372
[13:12:54] <m_gol> I could go for a used one to not bump sold 2.3 stats
[13:13:14] <DaveMethvin> haha
[13:13:27] <m_gol> at least on 4.4 Android browser is dead
[13:13:49] <m_gol> but Chrome-based WebView is still not updated automatically with Chrome :(
[13:13:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah and even the webview is chrome
[13:14:02] <m_gol> but tied to the OS
[13:14:24] <DaveMethvin> better than android at least ... i know it doesn't support a lot of hw acceleration either
[13:15:09] <m_gol> from our perspective at least it has modern APIs ;)
[13:16:21] <m_gol> argh
[13:16:34] <m_gol> I opened IE7 on BrowserStack to run the test suite
[13:16:46] <m_gol> it took a lot of time so I started doing other things
[13:16:54] <m_gol> and now the tunnel has been closed for inactivity :(
[13:17:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah i would like a longer timeout too
[13:17:33] <DaveMethvin> i do not want to sit there looking at ie7 ... it makes me kind of sick! :)
[13:17:58] <m_gol> :)
[13:18:33] <m_gol> I can't wait for the grunt task to do the testing remotely :)
[13:19:04] <m_gol> btw, what's the reson for the "hide passed test" option to be off by default?
[13:19:08] <m_gol> it slows down slow browsers
[13:19:36] <DaveMethvin> good question
[13:19:45] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[13:20:39] <m_gol> one test per 2 seconds, amazing speeeeed....

[13:41:25] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: still here?
[13:41:36] <DaveMethvin> yep m_gol
[13:41:45] <m_gol> what do you think about publishing beta.2 on npm?
[13:41:59] <m_gol> it has a notion of canary builds that are not installed unless asked specifically
[13:42:05] <DaveMethvin> would be a good trial run
[13:42:07] <m_gol> yep
[13:42:15] <DaveMethvin> what do we need to do for that?
[13:42:19] <DaveMethvin> i haven't been tracking
[13:42:28] <m_gol> I think timmywil has everything covered...
[13:42:29] <DaveMethvin> i think rwaldron has the keys to our npm setup
[13:42:37] <m_gol> so unless I'm missing sth we should be good to go
[13:42:41] <DaveMethvin> great
[13:42:47] <m_gol> yeah, he's listed as one of maintainers
[13:42:48] <DaveMethvin> at tomorrow
[13:43:04] <DaveMethvin> 's meeting we'll get everything straightened up for beta2
[13:43:12] <DaveMethvin> i am actually around all weeek
[13:43:16] <DaveMethvin> for a change
[13:43:31] <m_gol> I hope I'll be able to make a meeting though I'll be in a bus so it depends on my 3G connection on the road ;)
[13:43:35] <m_gol> haha
[13:43:56] <DaveMethvin> it;s always something i guess!
[13:44:06] <DaveMethvin> thanks for taking care of these tickets and pulls
[13:44:13] <m_gol> np.
[13:44:47] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I mailed them to you and Timmy a long time ago
[13:45:14] <DaveMethvin> ok rwaldron i prob have them but as long as timmy has them we're good
