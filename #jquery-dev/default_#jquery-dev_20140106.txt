[08:59:58] <jaubourg> sooo... is it freezing like crazy in the US?
[09:00:17] <arschmitz> jaubourg: where i am it is !
[09:00:32] <jaubourg> damn, take care and keep warm
[09:00:45] <jaubourg> saw the madness on the news
[09:00:49] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gibson042 m_gol markelog  rwaldron gnarf mikesherov jaubourg it's core meeting time over in #jquery-meeting!
[10:12:21] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin uGoMobi arschmitz ajpiano: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1161
[10:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to do something similar for Core and Mobile.
[10:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> These are projects that are big enough that our standard template isn't quite enough.
[10:13:15] <scott_gonzalez> But the amount of duplication is still too high.
[10:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> Feedback welcome.
[10:18:59] <ajpiano> seems like a good idea
[10:19:17] <ajpiano> was just looking through to make sure everything that was deleted was captured elsewhere

[10:25:50] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez ajpiano this sounds good to me too
[11:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Do we have a naming convention for options that have a negative connotation?
[11:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> Here's the scenario:
[11:02:40] <scott_gonzalez> I just made grunt-jquery-content automatically add permalinks to all headers for markdown files.
[11:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm adding an option to disable that.
[11:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> Do I use a positive name where only setting false makes a difference: headerLinks: false
[11:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> Or do I name the option in the negative?
[11:03:10] <DaveMethvin> i think usually it's "no" but i don't recall any discussion
[11:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> noHeaderLinks: true
[11:03:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah, something like that
[11:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll use that.
[11:04:42] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I updated the meeting notes link in #jquery-meeting
[11:05:00] <timmywil> I'm in San Fran btw
[11:05:09] <timmywil> meeting my new co-workers
[11:05:14] <DaveMethvin> oh thanks timmywil ... and good call,it's freezing back home i bet
[11:05:49] <timmywil> yea, it's incredible. Coldest it's been in decades. It's warm here tho.
[11:06:03] <DaveMethvin> lalalla don't want to hear it
[11:06:09] <timmywil> Chattanooga even got a little snow
[11:06:43] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: where are you again?
[11:06:49] <DaveMethvin> baltimore
[11:06:53] <timmywil> ah
[11:06:59] <DaveMethvin> gonna get to single digits tonight
[11:07:03] <timmywil> nana nana booboo
[11:07:12] <DaveMethvin> you can't stay there forever!
[11:07:15] <DaveMethvin> well you could
[11:08:08] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: do I have anything assigned to me for the RC?
[11:08:40] <DaveMethvin> is the release script done for that? if so then you're good
[11:09:18] <timmywil> "done" is a relative term. It is workable.
[11:09:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's NEVER done timmywil 
[11:09:51] <timmywil> My PR's landed so jquery-release now works with core, but there are still a few features missing.
[11:10:12] <DaveMethvin> i need to catch up on it anyway
[11:10:13] <timmywil> But nothing major
[11:11:22] <timmywil> Specifically, npm publishing, generating changelogs and contributor lists for pre-releases, and making sure the Google/MS CDN package building works

[11:11:47] <DaveMethvin> oh timmywil  were you good with publishing the 1.x to npm so browserify would work?
[11:12:17] <timmywil> Absolutely, but I was wondering if maybe we should do that under a different name
[11:12:39] <DaveMethvin> if they use the versioning properly it shouldn't be a problem :)
[11:12:41] <timmywil> npm install jquery-1.x, or something to that effect
[11:12:57] <DaveMethvin> you can use < in a version, right?
[11:13:30] <timmywil> true enough, but it would just be a matter of changing the name in the package.json on the 1.x-master branch
[11:14:01] <timmywil> maybe it's not such a good idea
[11:14:28] <DaveMethvin> i think we should have it all under jquery, we'll need some docs to explain we don't support 1.x in node anyway
[11:14:33] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery.com01] 15scottgonzalez tagged 06v2.0.13 at 142c13194: 02http://git.io/6vmOdQ
[11:14:48] <timmywil> yea, ok
[11:15:11] <timmywil> did we publish 1.11.0-beta2 to npm? I forget
[11:15:41] <DaveMethvin> honestly i would have to look
[11:15:52] <timmywil> beta3, but it looks like we didn't
[11:16:02] <DaveMethvin> i know there were a couple of tickets from people who were using the 1.8 that used to be there
[11:16:03] <timmywil> I could still do that
[11:16:13] <m_gol> we didn't
[11:16:36] <m_gol> the note 1.x is not supported in node should probably be added to README
[11:17:22] <m_gol> I wonder how many people need that btw
[11:17:34] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: quick Twitter survey like last time? ;)
[11:17:49] <timmywil> m_gol: anyone who uses browserify and supports oldIE
[11:17:49] <DaveMethvin> i think there are people doing lots of things we don't expect or encourage :)
[11:18:21] <DaveMethvin> domenic really wants npm to be the One True Package Manager, rather than Bower
[11:18:28] <timmywil> although "need" is debatable. I'd describe it as convenient for them.
[11:18:47] <m_gol> ok
[11:18:57] <DaveMethvin> or something they did, and it seemed to work, so they left it that way
[11:19:40] <timmywil> shall I publish the 1.x beta or should we wait for the RC?
[11:19:58] <DaveMethvin> somewhere out there someone has a web page with <script src="../node_modules/jquery/jquery-1.8.3.js"></script>
[11:20:25] <DaveMethvin> timmywil:  if you want to do it that would be fine
[11:20:30] <timmywil> I just couldn't bring myself to host the node_modules folder
[11:20:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[11:21:07] <DaveMethvin> then you could respond to that ticket and they can see if it works for them ... it should
[11:22:58] <m_gol> yeah, good idea to do it before RC
[11:23:19] <m_gol> oops https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/commit/844f197ecadc3f63efbc018983abb765c600a8a3#commitcomment-4994366

[11:40:24] <gnarf> anyone have a less dirty "force repaint" than .width() ? :) http://stackoverflow.com/a/20957733/91914
[11:46:11] <m_gol> gnarf: what's so dirty about that?
[11:48:13] <DaveMethvin> the funny thing about that is, i've seen chrome skip the repaint if the element you ask for width has a defined width in its css (not percent or auto)
[11:49:33] <m_gol> this forcing layouts via checking for specific things remind me of settings zoom: 1 to force hasLayout: true
[11:49:56] <m_gol> either sth is worth doing and there should be a standard way to do it or it's not and a different solution should be present
[11:50:10] <uGoMobi> gnarf: maybe setting outline 0
[11:50:52] <m_gol> uGoMobi: setting anything won't cause immediate repaint, only getting sth, will it?
[11:51:31] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, m_gol: how's this? https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commit/4d19306c7fe3e36dc5deba65b64a339baf2750e5
[11:51:35] <DaveMethvin> that example is a classic of when you do need a repaint to get the initial value set, but yeah i don't know a non-side-effect way to force that
[11:52:09] <DaveMethvin> looks good timmywil 
[11:53:55] <m_gol> timmywil: +1
[11:54:01] <uGoMobi> m_gol: I thought setting outline did cause an immediate repaint
[11:54:25] <m_gol> I thought we had another entry about support differences between 1.x & 2.x but can't find it now

[11:55:01] <DaveMethvin> i've written it several times but i don't remember where :/
[11:55:36] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: no, I remember it from sth different than blog posts

[11:57:38] <m_gol> btw, this is out of date
[11:57:38] <timmywil> 1.11.0-beta3 published to npm
[11:58:20] <m_gol> timmywil DaveMethvin: it should be tweeted
[11:58:29] <timmywil> good call
[11:58:35] <DaveMethvin> i can do that!
[11:58:43] <DaveMethvin> they gave me twitter keys
[11:58:55] <DaveMethvin> then i will retweet justin bieber
[11:58:58] <timmywil> Actually, we should probably remove the detailed list and link to browser support
[11:59:00] <m_gol> :D
[11:59:09] <m_gol> timmywil: I think the same
[11:59:12] <DaveMethvin> how would you like the tweet to read?
[11:59:15] <m_gol> or we'll always have situations like that
[11:59:21] <timmywil> exactly
[11:59:36] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: It should mention justin somehow
[12:02:34] <DaveMethvin> timmywil m_gol  how does this sound: For those of you using Browserify, we are publishing the 1.x branch on npm. Don't use it for node apps though! https://npmjs.org/package/jquery
[12:02:57] <DaveMethvin> the readme won't be on the main page there until we publish the production 1.11/2.1
[12:03:06] <m_gol> DaveMethvin +1
[12:03:18] <m_gol> (but without "how does this sound: " :P)

[12:07:19] <m_gol> https://github.com/mzgol/jquery/commit/dbd7e2be73329254b1fcacdd0ffa9516eef07bf4
[12:09:04] <timmywil> Maybe add something like: "Note that browser support differs depending on whether you are targeting master or 1.x-master."
[12:09:25] <m_gol> ok
[12:10:18] <m_gol> timmywil: https://github.com/mzgol/jquery/commit/452542a01dec95bac42449bc8774dc43662f2109

[13:41:03] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: was just visiting the ol' "functions passed to $.ready() don't fire after domReady" topic and was curious, would $.ready() returning a deferred be a bother?
[13:41:18] <danheberden> so that I could when($.ready()) or $.ready().then... 
[13:45:24] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: there's https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/205 but i don't think jQuery.ready.promise() will be its final form so I wouldn't write code against that
[13:45:56] <danheberden> oh, great
[13:46:02] * danheberden should have looked before asking
[13:46:06] <DaveMethvin> we're gonna transition to the standard DOM promises so something is going to change/break
[13:46:23] <danheberden> to detection of .then?
[13:46:39] <DaveMethvin> our internal code depends on Deferred behavior pretty heavily
