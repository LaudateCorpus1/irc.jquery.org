[05:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> Is it possible to get something like `ls -lR` without timestamps?
[05:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> The only data I care about is filename (full path from where I ran ls) and file size.

[07:53:17] <slon__> hola jquery!!!!!!!
[08:10:52] <slon__> Is this where all things jquery happen?
[08:11:07] <BradleyS> that's #jquery
[08:11:20] <BradleyS> this is for development of the jquery core
[08:11:38] <BradleyS> and pants
[08:18:13] <ajpiano> you really let him down there, BradleyS
[08:18:30] <BradleyS> apparently. i thought everyone liked pants.

[12:23:56] <tks2103> heyo! submitted pull request for ticket 8653
[12:23:57] <tks2103> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/714
[12:23:58] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by tks2103 (1m, 36s ago): Fixes #8653, handle undefined and null values in jQuery.param()
[12:26:18] <ajpiano> woo first time contriiiib
[12:26:32] <ajpiano> ?8653
[12:26:34] <bot-t> [#8653]  (bug : 1.5.1) - http://jqbug.com/8653
[12:35:32] <tks2103> hey ajpiano
[12:35:38] <tks2103> i work with msherov
[12:35:43] <tks2103> mikesherov
[12:35:49] <tks2103> rwaldron around?
[12:35:53] <ajpiano> oh nice, another new yorker
[12:35:55] <ajpiano> he probably is
[12:36:17] <tks2103> rwaldron: check the comments on my pull request, think the behavior in that ticket did not match some of the comments, the comments have more reasonable beahvior imo
[12:36:19] <tks2103> maybe
[12:36:41] <tks2103> ajpiano: yeah were having a hack-a-thon
[12:36:46] <tks2103> so... im hack-a-thon-ing hehe
[12:36:57] <ajpiano> oh nice, at SNAP
[12:36:57] <ajpiano> ?
[12:37:26] <tks2103> yarp
[12:37:42] <tks2103> ping pong and open source software
[12:37:45] <tks2103> come through, arent you in nyc?
[12:54:06] <ajpiano> haha yeah i am
[12:54:12] <ajpiano> got a bunch of stuff going on though right now
[13:01:05] <DaveMethvin> tks2103: thanks!
[13:01:37] <tks2103> DaveMethvin: np, what do you think expected behavior should be for nulls and undefineds
[13:01:57] <tks2103> seems reasonable to be able to specify a null and an empty string, and just leave off undefineds
[13:01:58] <DaveMethvin> i don't think ppl should pass nulls and undefineds :P
[13:02:01] <tks2103> lol
[13:02:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's what i proposed in the ticket
[13:02:35] <DaveMethvin> really it's ambiguous and trying to distinguish them at the server is probably not a good idea anyway
[13:02:43] <DaveMethvin> too many "special values"
[13:02:48] <tks2103> sure, but minor point, key= as expected behavior for null does not distinguish between a null value or an empty string
[13:02:49] <tks2103> sure
[13:02:59] <DaveMethvin> that doesn't bother me
[13:03:15] <DaveMethvin> but i don't know if it bothers the people who wanted this change in the first place
[13:03:33] <tks2103> yea
[13:03:44] <DaveMethvin> i just don't know how they get to that point, or what they are expecting their server to do
[13:03:59] <DaveMethvin> instead of val=undefined it seems like you'd just want to leave val out
[13:04:06] <tks2103> agree
[13:04:17] <tks2103> but its another "if"
[13:04:20] <tks2103> is it worth the codesize
[13:04:23] <tks2103> and breaking backwards compat
[13:04:23] <DaveMethvin> and for val=null i would be fine with it being the same as empty string
[13:04:30] <DaveMethvin> well it's a good question
[13:04:37] <DaveMethvin> what did the ticket whiners say?
[13:04:39] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[13:04:44] <tks2103> kthx
[13:04:55] <tks2103> im comfortable with whatever y'all decide, can implement np
[13:05:27] <DaveMethvin> wardrop is adamant that we are morons for doing what we do, so gosh we'd better change it asap :)
[13:06:10] <DaveMethvin> Douglas says that array.join is what we should look at, even though encodeURICompoenent is a standard API and it turns null/undefined into strings
[13:06:27] <DaveMethvin> so i guess it depends on what you randomly expected before you thought about it
[13:07:00] <tks2103> yeah, kidna thing that you would make up an opinion for on the spot no
[13:07:15] <DaveMethvin> and then stick to it no matter what!
[13:07:29] <tks2103> my first pull request is holy war territory
[13:07:38] <tks2103> how bout we just go with key= for undefineds and nulls
[13:07:44] <tks2103> minimal code
[13:07:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah i agree that's the simplest
[13:07:56] <tks2103> cool, ill fix it
[13:07:57] <tks2103> gracias
[13:08:00] <DaveMethvin> not worth the extra if
[13:08:05] <tks2103> kk, im on it
[13:08:10] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[13:08:14] <tks2103> np, thank you!

[14:01:53] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Can you weigh in on the EditorConfig discussion?
[14:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> There's been no input from anyone on any of the code teams :-(
[15:08:13] <johnbender> ajpiano: should I snap up an early bird ticket and then just get a refund for jqcon sf?
[15:08:41] <johnbender> ajpiano: if my talk get's the thumbs up that is
[15:09:35] <johnbender> for some reason I assume you have the answers to these things :P

[16:07:52] <mikesherov> danheberden: you here?
[16:07:52] <bot-t> (30 hours 10 mins ago) <paul_irish> tell mikesherov you could also try your gCS pleads with alexis!! http://trac.webkit.org/changeset/109818
[16:08:12] <danheberden> mikesherov for a couple more minutes perhaps
[16:08:20] <paul_irish> 4 more.
[16:08:26] <paul_irish> then the gypsies come.
[16:08:40] <mikesherov> just wanted the OK to restart mysql on the trac box if I need to
[16:08:45] <mikesherov> paul_irish: hey man!
[16:08:49] <paul_irish> hi
[16:09:03] <danheberden> mikesherov sure, just be sure to startup jquery-ui this time :p
[16:09:05] <mikesherov> I saw your message about gCS
[16:09:25] <mikesherov> so, I actually opened more than a few bugs about gCS
[16:09:31] <mikesherov> that thing is a shit show
[16:10:01] <mikesherov> not in chrome, per se
[16:10:18] <mikesherov> but the docs have *almost* nothing to do with reality
[16:10:48] <mikesherov> I've been talking to Glenn Adams about it a bit. So I wanted to thank you for pointing me in the right direction
[16:15:10] <paul_irish> \o/
[16:15:12] <paul_irish> whos glenn
[16:15:49] <mikesherov> New editor of CSSOM
[16:16:04] <mikesherov> which is actually a fairly old spec, just was mismanaged for a while
[16:16:13] <paul_irish> O
[16:16:18] <paul_irish> whos he from
[16:16:23] <paul_irish> ?g csswg cssom

[16:16:44] <paul_irish> well awesome
[16:16:48] <paul_irish> glad you're talkin
[16:16:49] <paul_irish> :D
[16:17:05] <mikesherov> Haha
[16:17:19] <mikesherov> I'm not there yet to actually commit to webkit
[16:17:59] <mikesherov> but I have a fairly good understanding of just how divergent gCS is, so I'm trying to poke the right people with sticks until the right things happen
[20:00:32] <mikesherov> .
[20:00:40] <mikesherov> Shucks
