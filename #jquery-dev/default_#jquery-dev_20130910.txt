[08:41:46] <JonathanDavis> Not all version of Opera support printing iframes but there is no current property available under jQuery.support that detects this
[08:42:41] <JonathanDavis> Am I missing something or is this simply an uncovered case in jQuery.support that I should whip up a patch and submit?
[08:43:02] <m_gol> jQuery.support is meant only for internal use
[08:43:09] <m_gol> no one outside of jQuery should use it
[08:43:17] <m_gol> so we only test what we need for our own code base
[08:43:33] <JonathanDavis> ohâ€¦Â ok
[08:44:02] <JonathanDavis> So feature detection for the rest of the jQuery user dev community should take place via our own mechanisms?
[08:44:18] <JonathanDavis> Since jQuery.browser is deprecated/removed
[08:46:21] <miketaylr> JonathanDavis: what versions of Opera, out of curiosity?
[08:47:12] <JonathanDavis> miketaylr: I'm currently in the process of nailing that down
[08:48:32] <miketaylr> JonathanDavis: if it's like, 11.60 or below you could easily make the argument that very few users will hit that bug
[08:48:56] <miketaylr> since like 95%+ of desktop users are autoupdated very quickly after a new release
[08:48:58] <JonathanDavis> yeah gimmie a few to verify this
[08:55:49] <JonathanDavis> So as of Opera 12.15 (Mac) the latest release delivered via App Store this issue still exists. It prints the entire window instead of the frame's contentWindow
[08:56:25] <JonathanDavis> I am unaware of later versions available for Mac
[08:57:09] <JonathanDavis> Hmmâ€¦Â I'm loading Opera 16 directly from their site
[08:57:17] <JonathanDavis> I'll give that one a try
[08:59:54] <JonathanDavis> Sorry, I don't follow Opera dev closely 
[09:01:35] <m_gol> JonathanDavis: for feature detection stuff it's best to use tools like Modernizr
[09:02:03] <m_gol> jQuery.support is by definition unstable, we can and we do make changes to it when needed (and sometimes we remove support tests when no longer needed)
[09:02:05] <JonathanDavis> Thanks for the tip and sorry to waste your time
[09:02:15] <JonathanDavis> m_gol yes, I understand
[09:02:39] <m_gol> in next jQuery version some jQuery.support properties become functions, for example ;)
[09:03:08] <JonathanDavis> I think the API docs are misleading then in that the jQuery.browser makes specific mention to look at jQuery.support instead leading a dev like myself to believe that it is the accepted best practice
[09:03:50] <JonathanDavis> https://www.dropbox.com/s/rix9anfkkdgt3ac/Screenshot%202013-09-10%2012.03.33.png
[09:05:03] <JonathanDavis> It does explain why jQuery.support.iframesPrintable doesn't exist though m_gol
[09:07:59] <m_gol> JonathanDavis: good catch... we should modify this text, thanks!
[09:09:08] <JonathanDavis> m_golâ€¦ I'd recommend updating that text and perhaps a stronger caution on jQuery.support
[09:09:19] <JonathanDavis> I read the text: "Since jQuery requires these tests internally, they must be performed on every page load. Although some of these properties are documented below, they are not subject to a long deprecation/removal cycle and may be removed once internal jQuery code no longer needs them." and understood the implications
[09:10:13] <JonathanDavis> But it only became really clear when you said that it was used internally and no one outside of jQuery devs should use it
[09:13:29] <JonathanDavis> miketaylr: wellâ€¦ I tried loading Opera 16
[09:13:46] <JonathanDavis> one of the guys on my team ran a test in Opera 15 and it is supported
[09:13:52] <JonathanDavis> or rather it works
[09:14:06] <JonathanDavis> Thanks for your help guys
[09:14:15] <JonathanDavis> and sorry to take up your time on such a niche issue
[09:16:54] <miketaylr> JonathanDavis: yeah Opera 15+ is based on Chromium so printing should be nicer
[09:17:05] <miketaylr> (printing was pretty terrible in presto)
[09:17:23] <JonathanDavis> aye
[09:20:42] <m_gol> JonathanDavis: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/366
[09:20:42] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #366 by mzgol (3m 55s ago): Fix #315. Discourage jQuery.support usage, remove examples.
[09:21:21] <JonathanDavis> yep looks good
[09:22:54] <JonathanDavis> thank m_gol should help a lot of other devs

[18:10:43] <timmywil> m_gol: hi
[18:11:13] <timmywil> thanks for doing that. seems to have saved some space in both branches.
[18:11:35] <m_gol> timmywil: I landed my patch as I saw you breaking a lot into smaller files and I wanted to avoid excessive rebasing :D
[18:12:00] <timmywil> no problem, wasn't actually hard to rebase on top of yours
[18:12:07] <m_gol> btw, we seem to be missing a policy of when to indend the function inside the define invocation
[18:12:20] <m_gol> I see most of the time it's not indented but sometimes it is
[18:12:50] <timmywil> yea, I haven't written it, but I recently conformed all modules to this rule: indent for var modules, no indent for non-var
[18:13:22] <m_gol> hmm, you made a mistake in getStyles
[18:13:36] <m_gol> you copied it from master and you redefine it again in curCSS
[18:13:52] <timmywil> which branch?
[18:14:01] <m_gol> and it can't be from master as there's an if for window.getComputedStyle
[18:14:02] <m_gol> 1.x
[18:14:06] <m_gol> the commit you just pushed
[18:14:17] <timmywil> oh, I must have left in the added getStyles from the cherry-pick
[18:14:24] <timmywil> I think it can simply be deleted

[18:14:42] <m_gol> right, if this is the only place it lies...
[18:14:53] <m_gol> maybe it should be merged to curCSS on master as well
[18:15:21] <m_gol> timmywil, do you know who can update browsers in TestSwarm? :)
[18:15:21] <m_gol> old Chrome & Firefox cause us failures
[18:16:15] <timmywil> I usually leave that to krinkle

[18:16:58] <m_gol> k
[18:17:23] <m_gol> we need to have Chrome >= 28 & Firefox >= 23
[18:18:05] <timmywil> I'm not sure browserstack has FF 23 yet
[18:18:29] <m_gol> it even has 24
[18:18:33] <m_gol> though it marks 23 as beta
[18:18:41] <m_gol> shouldn't be much of a problem, though?
[18:18:52] <timmywil> it should have the stable 23
[18:19:05] <m_gol> yeah, it doesn't so far
[18:19:22] <m_gol> but tests should behave the same on beta
[18:19:30] <timmywil> I'm curious why Chrome and FF are failing now though
[18:19:40] <m_gol> because of some tests
[18:19:44] <m_gol> Firefox & Chrome fixed them
[18:19:57] <m_gol> so the expected checks in support changed to true
[18:20:07] <m_gol> and they have false, hence the error
[18:20:29] <m_gol> maybe I'll just restore version checks I removed during my support refactor
[18:20:35] <timmywil> oh I see, just a support test
[18:20:44] <m_gol> I thought they're not needed anymore and it seems TestSwarm disagrees :)
[18:20:55] <m_gol> the only serious errors I see now are for Safari 5.1
[18:21:32] <timmywil> those 2 css errors in Safari 6 seem legit
