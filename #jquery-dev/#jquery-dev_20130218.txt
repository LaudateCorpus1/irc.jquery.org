[07:14:19] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin hi! I pinged you because I wanted you to review my patch to namespaced event removal
[07:14:52] <rwaldron> when no type was ever used, there was no way to get out of the recursive jQuery.event.remove call path
[07:15:25] <DaveMethvin> we didn't have a unit test for namespace only?
[07:16:26] <DaveMethvin> the attachment he did was wrong (using a namespace where an event name was needed) but we should be able to deal with removing by namespace for sure
[07:16:55] <DaveMethvin> oh but when we parsed the event name it looked like  a namespace :(
[07:17:14] <DaveMethvin> so it was the .on() that sent us to the dump
[07:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> This is what happens when people use event namespaces the wrong way...
[07:18:41] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin we had a test for namespace only, but the initial registration had a type
[07:18:44] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez is right
[07:18:49] <rwaldron> but bootstrap is doing it
[07:19:14] <rwaldron> jQuery(document).on(".ns", ... )
[07:19:17] <rwaldron> which is fine
[07:19:21] <rwaldron> until you try to trmove
[07:19:25] <rwaldron> jQuery(document).on(".ns", ... ).off(".ns")
[07:19:54] <rwaldron> when it goes into the if ( !type ) condition, then into the for ( type in events )... type will be ""
[07:20:09] <DaveMethvin> well it's "fine" but what does it do to look for only a namespace? logically that should be "on any event that has such a namespace..."
[07:20:21] <rwaldron> which means that the call to jQuery.event.remove( elem, type + types[i].... will just be the same call again
[07:20:34] <rwaldron> what does my patch do?
[07:20:36] <rwaldron> nothing
[07:21:01] <rwaldron> it just doesn't do the recursive call if type === ""
[07:21:15] <rwaldron> allowing it to continue through to the namespace removal
[07:21:21] <DaveMethvin> no my question is , what does .on(".abc", fn) do?
[07:21:37] <rwaldron> beats the hell out of me
[07:21:40] <DaveMethvin> lol
[07:21:54] <DaveMethvin> i think *that* is the problem
[07:22:19] <DaveMethvin> you can't have just a namespace for the event(s) argument when attaching events
[07:22:53] <DaveMethvin> the natural semantics for that would be "on any event of any kind that is triggered with that namespace, call the fn"
[07:23:20] * rwaldron facepalm
[07:23:32] <rwaldron> so... I just assumed that we supported insane shit like that
[07:23:37] <DaveMethvin> so .on(".abc", fn) would trigger on "click.abc", "mouseover.abc"
[07:23:38] <rwaldron> clooooosing
[07:23:39] <DaveMethvin> i  hope now
[07:23:41] <DaveMethvin> not
[07:24:08] <DaveMethvin> normally I'd say it's just bad input but it's not good that we get in a loop so much later
[07:24:21] <DaveMethvin> so it's probably good to turn .on(".abc", fn) into a nop
[07:24:24] <DaveMethvin> or something
[07:24:28] <DaveMethvin> but it's not critical
[07:24:34] <DaveMethvin> because it's a mistake
[07:24:38] <DaveMethvin> on their part
[07:26:18] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron i'm traveling today so i won't be able to make the meeting at noon ... i hoped to get the 2.0 beta out over the weekend but got backed up
[07:26:19] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling it's intentional on their part, but it's not how event namespaces are supposed to be used.
[07:26:25] <DaveMethvin> are we good to go there?
[07:26:45] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez i don't even know if that "works"
[07:26:58] <DaveMethvin> and if it does i'm inclined to go break it :)
[07:27:04] <DaveMethvin> we don't have unit tests for it
[07:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with us breaking it.
[07:27:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's absolutely the wrong way to use events.
[07:27:49] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron leave the ticket open and we'll figure out a resolution
[07:27:55] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, Yehuda encouraged using namespaces like this at the jQuery conf in '08 :-P
[07:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> It was the first time I met him in person and I heckled him from the back during his presentation :-)
[07:28:44] <DaveMethvin> well you shoulda done a better heckling job i blame YOU! :D
[07:29:14] <DaveMethvin> these event extensions are what makes our impl so complex
[07:29:32] <DaveMethvin> like the hassle with passing data, and the fact that it conflicts with the .data property on some native objects
[07:31:52] <DaveMethvin> i'll reopen the ticket so we can fix, but it's not priority at all
[08:07:01] <JamesMGreene> OK, scott_gonzalez, how would you produce we split out the QUnit addons into their own repos without duplicating the repo? Just push a branch to the new repo or something...?
[08:07:01] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[08:07:10] <JamesMGreene> `read
[08:07:10] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: From scott_gonzalez, 3h 12m 59s: duplicating the QUnit repo would definitely not be the right way to build a repo for an extension.
[08:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: There should just be a new repo with no history, and likely a different directory structure.
[08:08:51] <JamesMGreene> Well yeah, t
[08:09:03] <JamesMGreene> Definitely diff structure
[08:10:19] <JamesMGreene> I was assuming we'd want the history but, if not, then that makes it even easier
[08:12:04] <JamesMGreene> Any opposition to me trying that out?

[09:04:39] <siovene> Hi, is there a jquery meeting today, with Washington's bitrthday and all?
[09:09:26] <jaubourg> no meeting ?
[09:11:51] <siovene> Apparently...
[09:40:04] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer, thoughts? ^
[09:41:36] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: I don't know what jzaefferer's plans are for splitting repos.
[10:07:19] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene scott_gonzalez: I don't have immediate plans, though I'll start working on jQuery stuff again next week (conf prep took a lot more time than planned). Splitting addons isn't a high priority though, but also rather low effort. James, if you could create a repo for one or all of the addons you've been working on, to propose a layout, I could use that to push it to a repo under the jquery orga later. 
[10:13:10] <JamesMGreene> BTW, sounds good to me jzaefferer
[10:13:34] <JamesMGreene> I know the QUnit addons aren't high priority for QUnit but they are actually rather high priority for me at the moment :)
[10:16:17] <JamesMGreene> And, to be clear, I would be hoping for collaborator (admin) rights over all of these addon repos even after the initial transfer is completed
