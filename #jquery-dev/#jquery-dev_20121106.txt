[03:29:35] <jqcommit> qunit/master c1a3b59 JÃ¶rn Zaefferer: Canvas addon: Use 0.6 as alpha value to avoid inconsistencies between browsers. Fixes #342
[05:23:12] <scott_gonzalez> I think something just broke in jquery-git: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/420745
[05:24:14] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: interesting correlation with your removeData commit: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/886d6fe9fb8bcbf5e4e968bdd535a0fbcf2b88f7
[05:24:15] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery-ui by Scott GonzÃ¡lez (16h, 45m ago): Core: Patch over broken .removeData() in jQuery 1.6.1 + 1.6.2.
[05:25:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: It's unrelated.
[05:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> I think it was the jQuery.access() refactor.

[05:34:48] <gibson042> fix forthcoming
[05:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> thanks

[08:44:25] <DaveMethvin> oh swarmy
[08:44:35] <DaveMethvin> RO-bot? more like SLOW-bot, amirite?
[09:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? When did GitHub start promoting this as the way to handle PRs?
[09:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> curl https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/803.patch | git am
[09:38:09] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by elisy (4d, 11h ago):  	Datepicker: Added Kyrgyz localization
[09:39:10] <sindresorhus> scott_gonzalez: I use Hub, which gives me ability to do `git checkout https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/803` ;)
[09:39:10] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by elisy (4d, 11h ago):  	Datepicker: Added Kyrgyz localization
[09:41:07] <scott_gonzalez> sindresorhus: That adds a remote though, right?
[09:41:50] <sindresorhus> scott_gonzalez: yeah..., but it makes it super easy to pull updates from a PR when that happens, so I'd say it's worth the trouble
[09:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this is interesting.
[09:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> This guy doesn't have a fork.
[09:46:37] <scott_gonzalez> Or if he does, it's not public.
[09:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> That's why it's telling me to curl the patch instead of pulling his branch.
[09:48:41] <sindresorhus> scott_gonzalez: uhm, how is that possible?
[09:49:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's either private or he deleted after sending the PR, right?
[09:49:19] <scott_gonzalez> He has 0 public repos.
[09:49:36] <sindresorhus> I don't think you can have private forks of public repos
[09:49:44] <scott_gonzalez> Why not?
[09:49:51] <sindresorhus> I think I've heard it
[09:50:00] <sindresorhus> It might be the other way around though
[09:50:47] <sindresorhus> hmm, if he deleted it, would it still be possible to merge?
[09:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, PRs are forever.
[09:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> You can delete the branch, delete the repo, whatever.
[09:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub will keep the PR + associated commits + associated comments forever.
[09:52:45] <sindresorhus> oh, ok, yeah, that makes sense
[09:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> It's one of the reasons they recommend using PRs for everything.
[09:53:19] <scott_gonzalez> Permanent record of discussions for things that did and didn't land.
[09:53:41] <sindresorhus> ironic that you can't search through it though.
[09:55:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that'd be really useful.
[09:55:16] <scott_gonzalez> I can't count the number of times I've tried to find an old PR and struggled.
[09:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> I usually resort to searching Gmail.
[09:58:35] <sindresorhus> ya, the search is mostly useless
[09:59:04] <sindresorhus> also that artificial limit of only being able to search code in your own repos...
[09:59:56] <miketaylr> back
[10:05:30] <gnarf> wtf is going on with see ?12497 - This has got to be one of the strangest bugs i've ever heard of
[10:05:32] <bot-t> [#12497] jQuery 1.8.1 transitions crashing android 2.3.4 browser (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/12497
[10:06:45] <gibson042> I have no idea
[10:11:05] <gnarf> gibson042: I think I'm gonna close PR#1015 and ask him to open a new one and CC both of us when he gets there :)
[10:11:57] <gibson042> sounds good
[10:18:12] <gibson042> gnarf: what do you want to do about the android segfault pull https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1019 ?
[10:18:12] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by lukemelia (12h, 4m ago): Works around a crashing browser bug affecting Android browser < Android 2.3.5
[10:38:14] <gnarf> gibson042: if he's saying that fiddle is crashing his phone browser
[10:38:16] <gnarf> he's nuts
[10:38:49] <DaveMethvin> okay i just tried that with my nexus one phone android 2.3.4, it doesn't crash
[10:39:23] <DaveMethvin> but that was true of the other android bug from a while back
[10:39:45] <gnarf> only certain hardware?
[10:39:54] <DaveMethvin> i guess???
[10:40:11] <DaveMethvin> i couldnt repro on the emulators either
[10:40:13] <DaveMethvin> so i dunno
[10:40:14] <gnarf> I mean - he's saying that 1 - ( 400 / 500 || 0 ) is caushing his browser to crash...
[10:40:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah and his test case is like, "javascript is busted"
[10:40:28] <gibson042> yeah, that's the claim
[10:40:37] <DaveMethvin> you'd think that would cause more stuff to break
[10:40:40] <DaveMethvin> :)
[10:40:57] <DaveMethvin> that's not such a complex line of code
[10:41:01] <DaveMethvin> especially for us :D
[10:44:22] <DaveMethvin> percentÂ =Â 1Â -Â (Â 0.5Â ||Â 0Â );
[10:44:24] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[10:45:08] <gibson042> careful with that!
[10:47:42] <DaveMethvin> worksforme
[10:47:48] <DaveMethvin> replaced with an alert to be sure

[19:44:15] <ryanneufeld> hey koopersmith
[19:44:35] <koopersmith> hey ryanneufeld, how's it goin?
[19:44:41] <ryanneufeld> not bad
[19:44:49] <ryanneufeld> I was supposed to email you something... wasn't I?
[19:45:35] <koopersmith> I believe you were :)
[19:45:44] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna do that tonight
[19:45:52] <ryanneufeld> as someone else has asked for the same thing
[19:46:04] <koopersmith> awesome
[19:46:07] <ryanneufeld> there have been things happening at work
[19:46:23] <ryanneufeld> I thought I might stay, but alas, the usual has happened
[19:46:33] <ryanneufeld> so I'm continuing my search
[19:47:23] <koopersmith> gotcha. sorry to hear itÂ â€”Â I'll keep an eye on my inbox.
[19:48:22] <ryanneufeld> you can do ODT files? yes?
