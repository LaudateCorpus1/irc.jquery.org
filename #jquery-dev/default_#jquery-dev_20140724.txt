[02:41:44] <m_gol> it's us this time
[02:43:11] <m_gol> periodical TestSwarm force-kill time!

[05:50:16] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[05:50:17] <Krinkle> all browsers
[05:50:33] <m_gol> yes, one timmywil's commits broke effects tests
[05:50:41] <m_gol> * commit
[05:50:56] <Krinkle> ... and that's why we should test before merging.
[05:51:30] <m_gol> yeah, but it's a little harder when you can't do it from the command line
[05:52:04] <Krinkle> open test/ in any browser?
[05:52:18] <Krinkle> using our precious eyes to assert it passing
[05:52:31] <m_gol> yes, this one would be caught this way ;()
[05:52:32] <m_gol> * ;)
[05:52:41] <m_gol> but if only some browsers are breaking, it's harder
[05:52:47] <Krinkle> sure

[13:11:56] <JamesMGreene> Anyone have a Pro account on BuiltWith.com?
[14:57:33] <Krinkle> Hm.. anyone recognise this kind of distortion when using slide animation from jQuery in Chrome?
[14:57:39] <Krinkle> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=397281
[14:57:48] <Krinkle> It's creeping up in various places on Wikipedia
[15:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: I've seen that in the past (long time ago), but it's not happening for me now.
[15:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> And, of course, I have an out-of-date Chrome again...
[15:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> Stupid auto-updater never works for me.
