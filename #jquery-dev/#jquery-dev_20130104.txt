[05:49:28] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: i need to change the names for the -git versions built by jenkins, do you know where those jobs are located?
[06:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Are you logged into Jenkins?
[06:03:40] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: I don't think I've ever logged into Jenkins. Swarm, yes.
[06:04:15] <DaveMethvin> or is that what you meant?
[06:05:11] <scott_gonzalez> They have separate logins.
[06:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how to add a user, or if I even have proper permissions to do so.
[06:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> Let me poke around for a minute.
[06:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> You do have an account.
[06:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> dmethvin.
[06:07:25] <scott_gonzalez> See if you can log in.
[06:07:32] <scott_gonzalez> swarm.jquery.org:8080
[06:07:49] <scott_gonzalez> top right
[06:08:00] <DaveMethvin> yes
[06:08:06] <DaveMethvin> logged in
[06:09:21] <scott_gonzalez> ok, click on the jQuery Core project.
[06:09:37] <DaveMethvin> yep, found the job and the execute shell command
[06:09:37] <scott_gonzalez> Then click on Configure on the left.
[06:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[06:10:08] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, so i guess I'll need a new job for the 1.9 testing?
[06:10:17] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> You can create a job as a copy of another job.
[06:11:12] <scott_gonzalez> So you can do it pretty easily without worrying about missing stuff.
[06:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> Just click New Job on the left and then the last option is Copy existing Job.
[06:19:11] <DaveMethvin> thanks scott_gonzalez, i think i have it configured now ... i removed the dependent builds on the 1.x line for now, assuming that ui/mobile will need new jobs for those
[06:19:44] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we probably want to keep the existing depedents on 1.x.
[06:19:55] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need new dependents for 2.x since that will have a different browser set.
[06:20:10] <DaveMethvin> then you'll need to rename your jobs
[06:21:02] <DaveMethvin> all i know is that something has to change ... :D
[06:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:22:35] <scott_gonzalez> ok, we'll figure it out
[06:23:20] <DaveMethvin> if nobody depends on the project names I'd definitely rename them to make it clearer 
[06:23:36] <DaveMethvin> for now i can have the 1.9 branch build the oldly named jobs
[06:26:09] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, are they tied together by name?
[06:26:15] <scott_gonzalez> That's annoying.
[06:26:31] <jez> Did anyone see my suggestion here: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/add-thumb-up-thumb-down-icons-to-default-theme
[06:26:35] <jez> for thumbs up/down icons?
[06:26:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah, a job id would be easier to deal with
[06:28:53] <scott_gonzalez> You know, Zoho is much less useful when they don't send me emails.
[06:29:14] <DaveMethvin> I set up an rss feed, it's less noisy 
[06:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> I stopped getting emails 6 months ago.
[06:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea why.
[06:29:52] <DaveMethvin> spam filter perhaps?
[06:29:57] <scott_gonzalez> jez: To answer your question, no I didn't see it, and we're not currently adding any icons.
[06:35:19] <jez> scott_gonzalez: but can't we?  it should be quite easy
[06:35:28] <jez> i can even draw them
[06:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, Gmail is marking lots of stuff as spam.
[06:36:09] <scott_gonzalez> That explains why I stopped getting confirmation emails about status updates.
[06:36:31] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: yeah it marks the core bug updates as spam too, i had to whitelist 
[06:37:33] <scott_gonzalez> Oh no. How am I supposed to help these neglected wives seeking safe, discreet affairs if Gmail is marking all these messages as spam?!?
[06:38:03] <scott_gonzalez> jez: If it's quite easy, then you can add it yourself, right?
[06:38:19] <DaveMethvin> honey, if you want to fulfil my every desire, figure out how to make ie focus events work right
[06:38:25] <DaveMethvin> jez: it's not just about the drawing, it's creating new class names, updating the docs, updating themeroller, etc.
[06:40:50] <scott_gonzalez> jez: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/26308090/ThemeRoller%20icon%20set
[06:44:42] <scott_gonzalez> I bet Gmail started marking them as spam when they changed the format of their messages.
[06:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> I've never seen this format before.
[06:50:14] <jez> scott_gonzalez: has anyone suggested thumbs up/down yet?
[06:51:19] <scott_gonzalez> jez: I don't know. I don't follow the icons discussions.
[06:51:37] <jez> scott_gonzalez: also that page seems dead, not updated for 2 years
[06:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> Because we're not interested in adding icons right now.
[06:52:21] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Oh man, I just marked a ton of emails as not spam and now my inbox is huge.
[06:52:42] <DaveMethvin> see, google was doing you a favor
[06:53:03] <DaveMethvin> nobody appreciates the Big G
[06:56:19] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[06:56:27] <scott_gonzalez> Just replied to a year old thread.
[06:56:39] <DaveMethvin> oh you're gonna be THAT guy
[06:58:01] <scott_gonzalez> "Guys, I have a problem" ...1 year passes... "You're doing it wrong"
[07:07:37] <DaveMethvin> "You're doing it wrong, you should use this feature we added 5 months ago, 7 months after you posted."
[07:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I'm back down to one page...
