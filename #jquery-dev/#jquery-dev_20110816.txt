[08:22:22] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Remove requestAnimationFrame support. Fixes #9381. - timmywil
[12:19:57] <gnarf> timmywil: hey
[12:25:31] <timmywil> gnarf: hey, noticed there were some fails in effects due to the opacity filter removals, but I took care of it
[12:25:56] <gnarf> timmywil: did you see dave & I discussing the removal of raf yesterday after the meeting?
[12:26:25] <timmywil> i didn't
[12:26:48] <timmywil> brb
[12:26:55] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/6d7cf52d7cbf01959207
[12:31:27] <gnarf> timmywil: theres the log, i gotta run tho, got someone stopping in the office to copy some stuff off of a computer
[12:35:23] <timmywil> gnarf: This isn't really a feature.  This is effectively pulling an enhancement, which is not really out of the question in a point release if it fixes a bug.
[12:36:11] <timmywil> I see the flag as more of a feature because it is an addition to the API.
[12:37:11] <timmywil> Which in turn makes me concerned about removing said flag in the future.
[12:42:31] <gnarf> How long has raf been in?
[12:42:33] <gnarf> since 1.5 right?
[12:42:41] <timmywil> 1.6
[12:42:47] <gnarf> k
[12:42:54] <gnarf> changes my opinion mildly
[12:43:02] <gnarf> i thought it landed earlier than it did
[12:43:40] <gnarf> I'm still of the opinion that removing it is just a bad idea, it does nothing to solve the bad behavior issues, it just masks them until we bring back raf
[12:44:10] <timmywil> I really like raf, but given the fact that the spec for raf is still open to changes and that we're not exactly sure which direction the browsers will go in terms of saving CPU for ALL timers, I don't think adding it to jQuery is reliable or consistent enough yet.
[12:46:33] <gnarf> makes a good chunk of my presentation at jsconf kinda pointless
[12:46:44] <gnarf> specially since the title includes "requestAnimationFrame" :)
[12:48:00] <timmywil> that was actually mentioned lol
[12:48:07] <timmywil> I know everybody feels bad about that
[12:48:33] <gnarf> I'm as opposed to removing it as I was opposed to making .attr() back compat by default
[12:48:42] <gnarf> I think raf is where we want the library to move
[12:49:11] <gnarf> I think there are probably 10 people who don't mind having raf / actually like having raf for every 1 that is bothered by this "bug"
[12:49:32] <gnarf> I lost the previous argument too though
[12:49:43] <timmywil> heh, well you know how I felt about attr back compat.  I gave in.
[12:50:05] <gnarf> I think you shouldn't - I think you should have released the attrHooks as a "bc shim"
[12:50:12] <gnarf> not as a part of core
[12:50:35] <gnarf> because now .attr() is unpure bastard again
[12:50:46] <timmywil> The biggest one was probably too big of an issue (i.e. .attr('checked', true)
[12:51:06] <timmywil> but I'm talking about that at jqcon
[12:51:43] <timmywil> so maybe we'll be able to shave some of the unpure parts in a future release
[12:52:00] <gnarf> timmywil: shave them all in 1.7, release a back compat
[12:52:16] <gnarf> timmywil: get .attr() pure again
[12:52:28] <gnarf> timmywil: let the people who use it learn to do it "right" with .prop()
[12:52:43] <gnarf> or use the bc hooks
[12:53:51] <gnarf> re: raf --- I think its a dumb idea to remove it - I think adding a jQuery.support.raf = true/false is a better solution, and something we can continue to support with minimal impact in the future as well
[12:54:03] <ajpiano> i'm sorta inclined to agree with gnarf here
[12:54:10] <ajpiano> i'm surprised we're pulling it out so quickly
[12:54:23] <gnarf> Its all cuz i missed the meeeting yesterday
[12:54:28] <gnarf> and everyone had this argument without me
[12:54:35] <gnarf> :(
[12:54:51] <ajpiano> if we just acquiesced to cacophony we'd have fixed 7535 a long time ago
[12:57:23] <gnarf> For like 2 meetings straight I've brought up 9381 and JohnResig wasn't around to discuss - and we had constructive conversations that lead us to believe support flag was not a bad choice
[12:57:39] <ajpiano> ?9381
[12:57:40] <bot-t> [#9381] animations halt when the browser is out of focus due to requestAnimationFrame (closed bug: fixed in v1.6.3) - http://jqbug.com/9381
[12:58:10] <ajpiano> gnarf: if you e-mail bugs-team i'll back you p
[12:58:47] <ajpiano> cause like i'd be especially confused if we pulled it from 1.6.3 only to land a more robust version in 1.7
[12:58:54] <gnarf> well, i might do that in like 30 minutes, i need to shower and get to the office before this guy comes :)
[12:59:17] <ajpiano> heh ok!
[13:21:50] <rwaldron> gnarf, I'm also willing to back you up
[13:22:10] <rwaldron> btw, what is your email address?
[14:36:16] <gnarf> rwaldron: gnarf@gnarf.net / gnarf37@gmail.com
[14:37:35] <gnarf> jquery-bugs-team@googlegroups.com ?
[14:37:40] <gnarf> ajpiano: ?
[14:38:18] <ajpiano> yea
[14:38:29] <gnarf> I don't think im in that group
[14:38:32] <gnarf> mind adding me? :)
[14:38:42] <ajpiano> i don't have admin to it, ask danheberden
[14:39:57] <ajpiano> or you could open a forum thread too
[14:40:04] <ajpiano> would be interesting to get others perspectives as well besides our own
[14:40:11] <ajpiano> to the extent that people care
[14:40:54] <gnarf> http://oksoclap.com/s2vm9ieh1s
[14:42:22] <danheberden> gnarf is already a part of bugs team as gnarf@gnarf.net
[14:42:27] <gnarf> i am
[14:42:30] <gnarf> awesome
[14:42:51] <danheberden> which one would you rather have, gnarf?
[14:43:04] <danheberden> since i invited the gmail one just now not checking if the other was already on the list
[14:43:07] <rwaldron> gnarf did you get the incvite?
[14:43:11] <rwaldron> weird
[14:43:18] <rwaldron> danheberden i just sent an invite as well
[14:43:26] <danheberden> rwaldron he's been a member since april
[14:43:40] <gnarf> i knew i was on the -api-team
[14:43:43] <gnarf> wasn't sure about bugs
[14:43:47] <gnarf> but i guess i am :)
[14:43:54] <rwaldron> danheberden i didnt look, i jst sent it
[14:43:57] <rwaldron> but he must not be
[14:43:59] <danheberden> yeah me too
[14:44:01] <rwaldron> or i dunno
[14:44:06] <danheberden> heh heh
[14:44:10] <rwaldron> because didnt you want to edit the weekly meeting doc?
[14:44:12] <rwaldron> and couldn't?
[14:44:14] <danheberden> looks like timmywil never accepted his invite either
[14:44:34] <rwaldron> because anyone on bugs team mailing list has edit perms
[14:44:54] <danheberden> maybe he was logged in as the wrong email address
[14:45:03] <rwaldron> maybe?
[14:45:05] <timmywil> I never log in as that email
[14:45:27] <danheberden> oh there you are
[14:45:40] <timmywil> I get bugs team emails tho
[14:46:08] <danheberden> yeah, i didn't see the other one tehre
[14:46:15] <danheberden> didn't recognize the email
[14:46:47] <timmywil> np
[14:47:19] <gnarf> hrm
[14:47:25] <gnarf> maybe you should add me as gnarf37@gmail then
[14:47:31] <gnarf> if thats what controls the meeting doc too
[14:47:41] <gnarf> cuz i never login to gmail with gnarf@gnarf.net - its not hosted with google
[14:52:08] <timmywil> actually, I'm always logged into timmywillisn@gmail.com, but maybe I can change that myself?
[14:55:00] <timmywil> yea looks like i'd need another invite
[14:55:17] <gnarf> danheberden: now i'm getting this shitty spellcheck in chrome too
[14:55:51] <gnarf> ajpiano: forum or bugs-team - which you think?
[14:56:04] <ajpiano> forum, send a link to bugs team :)
[14:56:28] <ajpiano> i will prob tweet it from @jquery or something to
[14:56:59] <ajpiano> get a wider response
[14:57:06] <ajpiano> cause right now i think we are only hearing from the negative nancies
[15:02:27] <timmywil> it's a club: strong polemics for nancy pessimists
[15:06:18] <gnarf> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/please-don-t-remove-requestanimationframe
[15:08:15] <rwaldron> ugh
[15:08:28] <rwaldron> i dont care what people on forum say
[15:08:38] <ajpiano> rwaldron: why not
[15:08:58] <ajpiano> i want to encourage the people who agree with us to like, chime in
[15:09:07] <ajpiano> and not just base the ticket on people complaining on the tracker how its broken..
[15:09:32] <rwaldron> because if you asked them "what would you like to see in jQuery" they'd say.. "MOAR SUEDOH SLECTORZZZ!"
[15:09:40] <ajpiano> that's really cynical
[15:10:05] <gnarf> part of my argument includes that we've only heard from the vocal people with problems too
[15:10:14] <gnarf> so i'd like to hear from people who don't have problems with it too :)
[15:10:16] <ajpiano> if the question is whether this thing is a good idea or not we may as well bat it around in sunshine
[15:10:21] <ajpiano> exactly ^^
[15:11:23] <timmywil> i'd like to hear from smart people who think it should be removed as well.
[15:11:32] <ajpiano> that too
[15:11:42] <ajpiano> i guess i'm jus sayin that we know what the bugs team thinks :)
[15:11:59] <timmywil> i don't
[15:12:01] <rwaldron> "MOAR SINICLE!"
[15:12:04] <rwaldron> ugh
[15:12:05] <rwaldron> sorry
[15:12:14] <rwaldron> ajpiano kibits are fucking dumb
[15:12:54] <rwaldron> dude is changing an aspect of the api endpoint that will now require me to make more requests
[15:12:55] <gnarf> feel free to reply on bugs-team or on the forum post
[15:13:08] <timmywil> right now I think it's me and john versus you, gnarf, rwaldron with others on the fence so I'm not sure the bugs team has a clear position yet
[15:13:10] <rwaldron> and they filed >3 UI tickets today
[15:13:15] <rwaldron> >30**
[15:13:19] <gnarf> afk a bit
[15:13:38] <rwaldron> timmywil wait, what's my what?
[15:13:44] <ajpiano> timmywil: i guess i meant more like, we know what individuals think, not consensus
[15:13:50] <timmywil> oh i see
[15:14:14] <rwaldron> generally speaking, it think rAF is good and that end devs just write shitty code
[15:14:38] <timmywil> rwaldron: I think you've sided anti-removal?
[15:14:47] <DaveMethvin> me too
[15:14:49] <DaveMethvin> i just replied
[15:14:50] <rwaldron> but back in the day, when it was first brought up in a ticket I said i thought it was too soon
[15:14:57] <DaveMethvin> Corey is a convincer that guy
[15:15:11] <rwaldron> its like... we'll bolt on some rAF support
[15:15:26] <rwaldron> but fuck you for mentioning classList or dataset
[15:15:31] <DaveMethvin> hey what's wrong with bolts? it worked for Frankenstein!
[15:15:45] <timmywil> well I'll do my best to come up with a clear opposition later tonight so we can see both sides
[15:16:00] <DaveMethvin> we need a fox news of jquery
[15:16:07] <ajpiano> timmywil: i totally like, get the other side
[15:16:14] <ajpiano> like, what basically happened is
[15:16:16] <rwaldron> timmywil i guess what I mean is that as much as i know the end devs are making dumb mistakes, i jsut want what is best and easiest for them
[15:16:27] <rwaldron> and i'm open to differring POV
[15:16:33] <ajpiano> if you were writing code that wasn't a good idea before, but not getting punished for it, now you have code that isn't a good idea AND it's working badly
[15:16:57] <rwaldron> ^^^
[15:17:01] <DaveMethvin> that's why the flag makes sense i guess, and it's just basically disabling the rAF feature detect
[15:17:04] <rwaldron> ajpiano fights for the user
[15:17:04] <ajpiano> so the question is like, is the "improvement" in animations from rAF - which is awesome - but also hard for a lot of devs to really feel tangibly - is worth those breakages of bad patterns
[15:17:10] <DaveMethvin> so bad code can be free to be bad
[15:17:13] <timmywil> ajpiano: I think there are more factors than that, but I haven't constructed a comprehensible argument in my head yet
[15:17:18] <rwaldron> did anyone think about my idea?
[15:17:24] <rwaldron> reverse rAF flag?
[15:17:31] <rwaldron> off by default
[15:17:34] <ajpiano> off by default, and turn it on?
[15:17:37] <rwaldron> switch on for big kids
[15:17:38] <ajpiano> i don't think that's a bad idea
[15:17:52] <DaveMethvin> i'd prefer to leave it on
[15:17:52] <rwaldron> so UI and Mobile can benefit as much as possible
[15:17:57] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin stop it
[15:18:01] <DaveMethvin> lol
[15:18:06] <rwaldron> i agree
[15:18:07] <ajpiano> what's nice about off by default is like
[15:18:13] <rwaldron> but thats not going to solve anything... meany
[15:18:23] <ajpiano> this way people can opt in, and it doesn't break people'scode who are upgrading from 1.3.2 to 1.6.3
[15:18:33] <rwaldron> also a good point
[15:18:38] <rwaldron> gnarf thoughts?
[15:18:42] <rwaldron> timmywil
[15:18:47] <ajpiano> causeit's always gonna be those people who are gonna hate this type of thing
[15:18:57] <DaveMethvin> in a quantum leap from 1.3.2 to 1.6.3, rAF is your least worry :P
[15:18:59] <timmywil> I need to finish something right now, but lemme get back to you
[15:19:03] <rwaldron> ahahaha
[15:31:38] <rwaldron> kswedberg, you're generally a level headed guy
[15:31:50] <kswedberg> ohai :)
[15:31:55] <rwaldron> care to share thoughts here: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/please-don-t-remove-requestanimationframe ?
[15:33:09] <kswedberg> rwaldron: sure. have to attend to the grill at the moment. but will read through it and reply asap
[15:33:19] <rwaldron> aw man
[15:33:32] <rwaldron> grillin'
[15:36:44] <kswedberg> yessir!
[15:38:10] <gnarf> rwaldron: I think on by default is safer, leaves it to the end user to decide if it should be on or off, and libraries can write code with on in mind
[15:38:23] <gnarf> if we turn it off, then we hide the problem from the library developer who doesn't read about the flag
[15:38:40] <gnarf> and then the guy who uses the code and also uses raf is going to be in for a big suprise
[15:39:17] <rwaldron> Fair enough.
[15:40:25] <gnarf> added to the forum post ;)
[15:40:45] <rwaldron> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/please-don-t-remove-requestanimationframe#14737000002626964
[15:41:03] <danheberden> DaveMethvin <3
[15:41:16] <DaveMethvin> thanks for the review btw danheberden
[15:41:35] <danheberden> heh, well when i my original code getting improved, i HAVE to take a peek
[15:41:36] <danheberden> :p
[15:41:39] <DaveMethvin> you have a bright future as a code compressor
[15:41:52] <danheberden> you guys created this
[15:41:56] <rwaldron> aw maaaannnn
[15:42:05] * danheberden looks at rwaldron
[15:42:06] <rwaldron> i wish i got notifications when pull requests were made
[15:42:10] <rwaldron> :(
[15:42:15] <gnarf> you do if you watch don't you?
[15:42:20] <DaveMethvin> you should
[15:42:28] <gnarf> actually
[15:42:33] <rwaldron> "-ms-take": "msTake"
[15:42:39] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i don't
[15:42:45] <gnarf> i think you don't get "notifications" it just shows up on your dashboard
[15:42:50] <rwaldron> lame
[15:42:52] <danheberden> rwaldron i can have gmail forward them to you when i get them :p
[15:42:54] <rwaldron> i never look there
[15:42:55] <gnarf> only get "notified" if you have write access to the repo
[15:43:01] <rwaldron> danheberden do it!
[15:43:14] <rwaldron> gnarf what the fuck is the "dashboard"
[15:43:22] <rwaldron> (github feature fail)
[15:43:35] <gnarf> https://github.com/dashboard
[15:43:38] <DaveMethvin> the dashboard is where my hopes of getting other things done are dashed
[15:43:47] <danheberden> rwaldron pm me your email, i will :)
[15:44:05] <gnarf> I played with that -ms-take pull
[15:44:12] <gnarf> trying to compress it into a single re
[15:44:23] <gnarf> instead of two
[15:45:02] <rwaldron> twitter has a been a tool bar and a blank white screen for me all afternoon
[15:45:09] <rwaldron> how does that site still exist
[15:45:17] <rwaldron> worst user experience ever.
[15:46:24] <danheberden> rwaldron that's why i use tweetdeck
[15:46:33] <rwaldron> i dont want "another thing"
[15:46:37] <rwaldron> i just want a tab
[15:46:39] <rwaldron> in the browser
[15:47:29] <danheberden> exactly
[15:47:40] <danheberden> tweetdeck app in chrome
[15:47:45] <danheberden> got it pinned next to gmail
[15:48:24] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin maybe switch these...
[15:48:32] <rwaldron> && isNaN( value ) || value == null
[15:48:43] <rwaldron> && value == null || isNaN( value )
[15:48:58] <rwaldron> (i learned that from you, so no back sass )
[15:49:52] <danheberden> though i imagine the isNaN being the one that trips up
[15:50:08] <danheberden> meaning the value == null might be an extra conditional to check on it's way, albeit less expensive
[15:50:09] <rwaldron> but if the value is null or undef, there is no point
[15:50:19] <rwaldron> in asking isNull(anything)
[15:50:31] <danheberden> haha, i was trying to be all existential about it
[15:50:53] <danheberden> shouldn't play around like that at the end of the day :p
[15:51:04] <rwaldron> same ehre
[15:51:05] <rwaldron> here*
[15:51:18] <rwaldron> between the hours of 4-7 i make the most mistakes
[15:51:44] <danheberden> funny how coding works - i did that css stuff like 5 months ago
[15:52:02] <danheberden> and looking at it now i'm like 'oh i could have done that better'
[15:52:06] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://jsperf.com/camelcases
[15:53:24] <rwaldron> no entry for camelToe?
[15:53:31] <rwaldron> (bwahahahahahahahahahahahaha)
[15:54:24] <gnarf> heh
[15:54:40] <danheberden> dave might as well add a +=+9x to the test
[15:54:52] <danheberden> and -=+9x
[15:55:10] <danheberden> DaveMethvin ^
[15:55:36] <gnarf> seems some re interpretations disagree
[15:55:48] <gnarf> but chrome thinks mine is faster, everyone else thinks dave is faster
[15:55:54] <gnarf> which is why i gave up with it?
[15:55:59] <DaveMethvin> whoa, i go away for 5 minutes and you guys are rewritin mah code! sweet!
[15:58:57] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i did that last night actually
[15:59:24] <gnarf> but gave up on it cuz some RE apparently take longer with the lookahead
[15:59:53] <DaveMethvin> so in other words, our implementations went camelToe to camelToe and mine won?
[16:00:15] <gnarf> yours won in more browsers than mine did
[16:00:21] <gnarf> :)
[16:00:31] <DaveMethvin> and both were pretty fast anyway
[16:00:49] <DaveMethvin> but it's always worth testing some other ways of doing it
[16:00:55] <gnarf> aye
[16:01:00] <DaveMethvin> the double-replace just doesn't look as pretty i agree
[16:01:12] <gnarf> well using tricky re's becomes less maintainable
[16:01:25] <gnarf> so, prettiness is in the eye of the beholder too
[16:01:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah, the animation code for += worked already but then i had to change the css code and that was, er, trickier
[16:02:42] <DaveMethvin> how can there be so much of jquery i don't know?
[16:03:12] <DaveMethvin> i'm always coming across sections of code and thinking, "I've never seen this before"
[16:03:25] <gnarf> I dunno, I think I've read the whole core codebase at least once now
[16:03:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah me too but i forget it quickly
[16:03:44] <DaveMethvin> and it keeps changing
[16:03:52] <DaveMethvin> STOP CHANGING!
[16:04:07] <DaveMethvin> they have a name for codebases that stop changing. dead.
[16:04:18] <gnarf> effects / queue / css / deferred / manipulation / selector are parts that I've been in for way too much time
[16:05:00] <DaveMethvin> but it's good that we have ppl who are experts in sections of code
[16:07:51] <rwaldron> def
[16:08:02] <rwaldron> because some areas I want nothing to do with
[16:08:19] <rwaldron> tbh, i was a little terrified by the fixed position ticket
[16:08:24] <rwaldron> but whatevs. I win.
[16:08:57] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron don't go bitchin to me, i rewrote $.browser a while back. Do you know how hard it is to write code with a clothespin on your nose??!!!1
[16:09:08] <rwaldron> hahahahaha
[16:09:22] <rwaldron> yeah dude, remember... i begrudgingly added chrome!
[16:09:27] <rwaldron> clothespins and all
[16:09:35] <rwaldron> there was a lot of muttered swears
[16:09:39] <DaveMethvin> that's only a one-nostril-plugger patch
[16:11:05] <gnarf> I just updated that PR of mine to be jQuery.support.raf also
[17:21:11] <kswedberg> gnarf: yt?
[17:21:22] <gnarf> kinda
[17:21:41] <kswedberg> k. just commented on that forum post.
[17:21:50] <kswedberg> don't hate me!
[17:23:34] <gnarf> heh
[17:24:27] <gnarf> opt-in further encourages bad practice in animate code imo
[17:24:35] <gnarf> thats my main argument for opt-out
[17:25:06] <gnarf> but either way, opt-in or opt-out I'd rather have a flag that remove raf entirely
[17:25:08] <kswedberg> it doesn't encourage anything.
[17:25:20] <kswedberg> +1 on a flag
[17:25:29] <gnarf> i think removing raf is a bad choice
[17:26:11] <kswedberg> agreed
[17:26:43] <gnarf> I personally want to encourage people to learn to handle it with raf enabled by default - leaving the flag as a "last ditch" effort or a way to "quick revert" the enhancement
[17:26:56] <danheberden_> but now we can blame kswedberg for anything people dont' like
[17:27:12] <danheberden_> "WTF IS THIS RAF FLAG?!" - "it was karl's idea"
[17:27:13] <kswedberg> danheberden_: you could always do that.
[17:27:15] <gnarf> plus as a "support" test it makes sense to start out at the value of requestAnimationFrame exists or not
[17:27:17] <danheberden_> haha
[17:28:00] <gnarf> where as opt-in means we will basically "disable" raf even when its supported... I.E. jQuery.support.raf = false always
[17:28:28] <kswedberg> danheberden_: I have no idea whose idea the raf flag was, but I'm the last person to weigh in on it, not the first. ;)
[17:28:33] <gnarf> if we opt-out, jQuery.support.raf = !!requestAnimationFrame
[17:28:46] <gnarf> kswedberg: pretty sure the flag was my idea, so blame me ;)
[17:29:02] <kswedberg> IT'S ALL GNARF'S FAULT!!!111
[17:29:08] <DaveMethvin> How can anyone oppose the raf flag? why do you hate british military airmen?
[17:29:20] <kswedberg> ohai DaveMethvin!
[17:29:24] <danheberden> witty as ever, DaveMethvin
[17:29:26] <gnarf> opt-out makes more sense from inside the code base imo
[17:29:37] <gnarf> because the initial state of the flag is basically the featureDetect for raf
[17:29:45] <kswedberg> but jQuery users don't live inside the code base. you do.
[17:29:48] <gnarf> true
[17:29:57] <kswedberg> :)
[17:30:00] <gnarf> having a flag we set to false on default makes less sense to me though
[17:30:08] <gnarf> afk quick, brb
[17:30:09] <kswedberg> I understand that.
[17:30:13] <kswedberg> k
[17:30:18] <DaveMethvin> here is a thought ...
[17:30:30] <DaveMethvin> we make a lot of design decisions here that aren't written down well
[17:30:33] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: first time for everything!
[17:30:38] <kswedberg> :)
[17:30:40] <DaveMethvin> duhhhhh
[17:30:40] <kswedberg> jk
[17:30:56] <DaveMethvin> earlier i suggested a blog for these things
[17:31:00] <DaveMethvin> entries that live for a while
[17:31:05] <DaveMethvin> that we can link to
[17:31:16] <DaveMethvin> to document the choices and also show what they should be doing
[17:31:21] <kswedberg> what are you waiting for?
[17:31:27] <DaveMethvin> we could do that in learn.jquery.com?
[17:31:37] <DaveMethvin> i think i was waiting for that to appear :P
[17:31:48] <kswedberg> sure. but in the meantime, you could do that in learningjquery.com or blog.jquery.com.
[17:31:53] <DaveMethvin> honestly i'll write more of that up
[17:32:04] <kswedberg> we can transfer stuff over when it's ready.
[17:32:24] <DaveMethvin> i'll put something together and let everyone review it so it reflects the views of the team
[17:32:38] <kswedberg> cool
[17:32:38] <DaveMethvin> but i think we need to let ppl know the agonies we go through for them
[17:32:47] <kswedberg> absolutely.
[17:33:21] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll get started on this one ... gimme a few days
[17:33:32] <kswedberg> awesome. thx, Dave!
[17:34:15] <kswedberg> aww crap. didn't realize what time it was. gotta be afk for a while. will leave irc open in case good discussion happens. :)
[17:34:28] <kswedberg> SO NO TALKING BEHIND MY BACK, danheberden! :D
[17:34:50] * DaveMethvin listens for karl's footsteps ... is he gone?
[17:35:02] <DaveMethvin> ok, party time!
[17:35:05] <danheberden> :p
[17:35:40] <danheberden> now we can talk about him!
[17:40:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: share your blog post, I'll add some of my thoughts too ;)
[17:41:07] <DaveMethvin> gnarf yeah definitely ... i will have something written by tomorrow
[17:41:33] <DaveMethvin> i am on a plane most of the day tomorrow so that will give all of you plenty of time to throw it out and start again ... :)
