[06:03:41] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Please use PRs for jquery-release.
[06:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi arschmitz jzaefferer timmywil: Let's talk about GitHub issues.
[06:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> Since we just get flat labels for tagging issues, I'd like to propose using `field:value` for certain labels.
[06:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> For example, right now Mobile has a "Panel" label, I'd like to change that to: "component:panel" or "Component: Panel"
[06:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like QUnit has a few labels, but not one per src file (component).
[06:45:49] <scott_gonzalez> Sizzle is just component-less as far as I can tell.
[06:46:51] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: +1 i already proposed something like this to uGoMobi
[06:47:14] <jzaefferer> Sounds good to me. Sound that QUnit has src split into multiple files, it makes sense to structure issues accordingly
[06:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> For readability, I think "Component: Panel" works well.
[06:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> And it's just as easy to parse.
[06:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, sounds like we're good to make this change.
[06:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'll use that logic in the release script.
[06:48:30] <arschmitz> one thing is we were considdering using 0: because tags are applied in alphabetical order
[06:48:51] <arschmitz> so that would ensure the component was always first
[06:48:57] <arschmitz> label on the issue
[06:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> Seems bad.
[06:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> How many labels are you going to apply to an issue that order matters?
[06:50:23] <arschmitz> not enough 
[06:50:27] <arschmitz> lol
[06:51:14] <arschmitz> just something we talked about so i thought id mention it
[06:53:07] <arschmitz> so yeah i like this 
[06:54:36] <arschmitz> and i think with the space is better much more readable

[08:40:07] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: we use to publish the artifacts before pushing the tags because it's more reversible than the tag
[08:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> You shouldn't publish anything until the actual repo is fully updated.
[08:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> The code is the primary thing.
[08:40:47] <gseguin> we could put a confirmReview after the pushing of the artifacts 
[08:41:06] <gseguin> that's a good way for us to do a last sanity check
[08:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> Things like emaling Google and updating jquerymobile.com should not affect the tag.
[08:41:33] <gseguin> once the demos are uploaded on the website we can access them and double check
[08:41:39] <gseguin> that's what we use to do
[08:42:03] <gseguin> and if something goes wrong cancel the push of the tag
[08:42:59] <gseguin> code is primary I agree, but pushing the demos to the website is much less public than pushing the tag to the repo
[08:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> What kind of issues do you expect to appear during the demo copying?
[09:01:06] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: not during the demo copying but after the demos have been uploaded to the website we can do a sanity check before hitting the green button and pushing to github
[09:01:26] <gseguin> that's how we've been doing releases so far
[09:02:33] <gseguin> we push to the CDN and website first, make sure that the blog post links are working, do a sanity check then push the tag
[09:06:21] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I agree that the emailing Google should happen very last because it's more public than pushing to our website
[09:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> Why don't you just check your demos first?
[09:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> Before running the release script?
[09:09:02] <scott_gonzalez> If you're not expecting problems during the copy, then it's a question of "do the demos work?" not "do the demos work after the deploy when put on the web site?"
[09:10:12] <gseguin> there are also the links in the blog post
[09:10:36] <gseguin> uGoMobi can tell you it's been useful to use that process
[09:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> Can you expand on that?
[09:11:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how links in a blog post are related to this.
[09:11:10] <gseguin> I don't really care either way I'm just automating what the team has been doing manually so far
[09:11:39] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: make sure in the blog post draft that the links to the distributables are working
[09:11:53] <gseguin> that there are no typos
[09:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> They shouldn't be manually written for every post...
[09:12:20] <gseguin> well they are
[09:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> That should stop.
[09:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, that's unrelated.
[09:14:35] <scott_gonzalez> The blog post isn't published until after the release script finishes.
[09:29:58] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: like I said, I'm fine either way. I was just trying to stick to the steps that we've been doing so far
[09:46:23] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: on the other hand, do you want to push the tag if something went wrong during the publishing of the artifacts?
[09:50:06] <scott_gonzalez> Again, what is going to go wrong?
[09:50:21] <scott_gonzalez> If you haven't noticed by now, I don't like talking about abstract problems.

[11:25:24] <uGoMobi_> scott_gonzalez arschmitz : +1 to "Component: Name" for GH labels
[11:25:50] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: I think that "0" only had to do with something in the current script
[11:26:42] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: don't remember exactly but thought we needed "Fixed" to come first or something like that
[11:29:51] <uGoMobi_> gseguin scott_gonzalez: re: the release script... I think if we automate things there is no need to check everything manually before we release
[11:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks uGoMobi_
[11:42:49] <uGoMobi_> scott_gonzalez: can you point me at your template for UI blog posts so I can see how you handle the links in the "Download" section?
[11:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> I just use the previous blog post.
[11:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> search and replace the version number.
[11:44:42] <scott_gonzalez> I open WordPress, copy the previous post, paste it into my editor, search and replace the version number, change "Nth" to "N+1th", change the list of components, and change the thank you section.
[11:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'll probably automate that with the new system, but the manual process is pretty easy and not really error-prone.
[11:47:08] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ah ok, I do more or less the same
[11:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so there's not really a chance for you to get a typo the URL.
[11:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you get a typo in every URL from a typo in the search and replace.
[11:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> But either way, as I mentioned earlier, the blog post isn't going to be published until after this script finishes anyway.
[11:50:17] <uGoMobi> the problem with Mobile wasn't really updating the links in the blog posts, more that we kept changing infrastructure
[11:50:34] <scott_gonzalez> That makes more sense.
[11:50:52] <scott_gonzalez> And is a problem I'm trying to solve with jquery-release.
[11:51:51] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:52:23] <scott_gonzalez> Getting in a car. Gonna drop off IRC.
[11:52:33] <uGoMobi> ok later
