[06:19:29] <joshAnderson99> would anyone know why in page source, onclick="$('div#downloadlinks7619506').load('download.php?file_id=7619506'), when manually appended to the domain, file2find.com as http://file2find.com/download.php?file_id=7619506, the result is just a page with the text "bok", rather than what it should be, or what i think it should be, which is a list of URLs?  could the php page be checking whether 
[06:19:29] <joshAnderson99> the click occurred within the page, and if not, returns the nonsense "bok".
[06:19:55] <m_gol> joshAnderson99: support is in #jquery
[06:30:35] <joshAnderson99> ok ta

[09:01:43] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: meeting?
[09:01:48] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:54:44] <DaveMethvin> m_gol orkel you guys should have access to api and jquery.com 
[09:55:13] <m_gol> I do, thx!
[09:55:18] <m_gol> I'll merge both prs then
[09:55:29] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[09:55:32] <m_gol> if you have sth against, speak now! ;)
[10:04:27] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: weird, I see the green button but if I try to push to master, I'm asked for GitHub username & password
[10:04:40] <m_gol> I've pushed to my own GitHub branch without any problems a moment ago
[10:04:48] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, i will look into it after this meeting
[10:06:40] <kripper> Hi, i need some help here
[10:06:59] <kripper> I found a race condition bug related with releasePageTransitionLock()
[10:07:51] <kripper> I found out that in some cases a JQM transition is started transitionPages( toPage, fromPage, settings.transition, settings.reverse )
[10:07:58] <kripper> but the .done callback is not executed
[10:09:15] <kripper> the problem is occurs when 2 changePage calls are enqueued in the pageTransitionQueue()
[10:09:27] <kripper> it currently only supports enqueuing 1
[10:09:46] <kripper> a second enqueued changePage call will not be executed
[10:09:48] <kripper> I fixed this
[10:09:55] <kripper> but now I found another problem
[10:09:58] <kripper> probably related
[10:10:16] <kripper> where transitions are started but never ended (done is not called)
[10:10:21] <kripper> can anyone help?
[10:10:24] <m_gol> `tell DaveMethvin I was able to push to api.jquery.com but not to jQuery.com, even though I see the green merge button on the page, extremely weird...
[10:10:25] <b-ot> m_gol: I‚Äôll tell DaveMethvin about that.
[10:10:25] <kripper> plz
[10:10:25] <DaveMethvin> kripper support in #jquery
[10:10:29] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[10:10:53] <kripper> is #jquery for developers?
[10:12:00] <m_gol> kripper: yes, the only users of jQuery aware of its existence (and thus being able to ask questions) are developers
[10:12:02] <kripper> I need help form someone with deep knowledge of the pageTransitionQueue internals
[10:12:30] <kripper> I mean core-developers
[10:12:38] <kripper> not users
[10:12:38] <m_gol> besides, #jquery-dev is for jQuery Core developers, not jQuery Mobile ones
[10:14:08] <kripper> is there a JQM core developer channel?
[10:14:51] <m_gol> yes, #jqueryui-dev
[10:15:07] <kripper> ok, I've been redirected from there
[10:15:09] <kripper> will try again
[10:15:10] <kripper> thx

[12:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin|away gnarf JamesMGreene mikesherov mkwst paul_irish rwaldron snover wycats
[12:12:37] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yo
[12:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably get some feedback from the team on http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2013JulSep/0475.html
[12:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> 2 things in that thread.
[12:12:57] <scott_gonzalez> 1) The proposal of a first class Selectors.
[12:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> 2) A discussion about matches() vs. mastchesSelector() and prefix hell.
[12:13:15] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yeah, read that
[12:13:26] <snover> a new type makes something first-class?
[12:13:31] <mikesherov> but AVK is suggesting new API
[12:14:36] <mikesherov> I mean, it's basically $().is()
[12:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> right
[12:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> I think the discussion around this statement is where we should provide feedback from a scriptlib persepective: "I have no sympathy or patience to maintain the backward compatibility with the code that has never worked."
[12:16:09] <mikesherov> $ = function( selector) { this.selector = new Selector(selector); } $.prototype.is = function(match) { return this.selector.test(match);}
[12:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> I seem to recall us having the same discussion about matches vs. matchesSelector for unprefixed code in jQuery.
[12:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> But I haven't dug up the PR/discussion.
[12:17:28] <mikesherov> I read that thread and let it fly by
[12:18:55] <mikesherov> this reply was my sentiments exactly: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2013JulSep/0487.html

[13:14:23] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, is the `2.0.4` tag (generated by npm version patch) OK or should I wait for scott_gonzalez opinion?
[13:14:50] <scott_gonzalez> For jquery.com?
[13:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> 2.0.4 is fine.
[13:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin uses the wrong version all the time :-P
[13:15:48] <DaveMethvin> if it gets something pushed from stage to production, it can't be wrong! :)

[13:17:32] <m_gol> done on both jquery.com & api.jquery.com
[13:30:21] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: we should do sth with http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13956 and http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13767 before releasing beta IMO
[13:30:36] <m_gol> especially that we have pull requests waiting
[13:32:12] <DaveMethvin> m_gol i'm good with that, would you be able to get them ready?
[13:32:17] <DaveMethvin> i have a feeling they need some rebasing
[13:32:24] <m_gol> :)
[13:32:29] <m_gol> they mostly wait for decisions
[13:32:41] <m_gol> about what do we do about non-positioned elements
[13:33:04] <m_gol> do we try to normalize to the messed-up gCS spec etc.
[13:33:36] <DaveMethvin> which is, as i recall, not what most people expect
[13:33:39] <m_gol> at least the http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13767 one
[13:34:06] <m_gol> we have 3 options
[13:34:48] <m_gol> 1) try to match the gCS spec, i.e. returning 1%, auto etc. sometimes (especially this 1% is weird considering that it doesn't take effect as we're talking about non-positioned elements...)
[13:35:20] <m_gol> 2) try to always return pixels, i.e. we have to skip gCS on non-pos. elements and do our own thing
[13:35:39] <m_gol> 3) just declare results on non-pos. elements are undefined and not care about these cases
[13:36:15] <DaveMethvin> well you know #2 is the hardest and biggest
[13:36:25] <DaveMethvin> and i just have to wonder how common it is that people need it
[13:36:38] <DaveMethvin> sure i'd love for it to work
[13:36:49] <DaveMethvin> but not enough to have a bunch of special case code
[13:37:02] <DaveMethvin> but that's my opinion, having never needed it
[13:37:18] <m_gol> I like (3) but I wonder if people won't be complaining about inconsistent results in a public API
[13:37:36] <DaveMethvin> as long as we document it and it makes sense for it to be inconsistent
[13:37:41] <m_gol> of cource the best would be to have .usedStyle and use it but that's in the future
[13:37:46] <DaveMethvin> right
[13:38:24] <m_gol> we might do a little part of (2), i.e. on left/right/top/bottom to return 0 on non-positioned elements
[13:38:34] <m_gol> though I'm not sure if that improves the situation much
[13:38:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah becuase then people start to depend on THAT
[13:38:56] <DaveMethvin> and when we can give good results in the future their code breaks
[13:38:59] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov any thoughts on ^^
[13:39:21] <m_gol> yes, I'd love to hear mikesherov thoughs on that :)
[13:40:15] <m_gol> though he seems a little unavailable recently :)
[13:40:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's like he has twins or something
[13:41:01] <m_gol> ;)
[13:41:20] <m_gol> maybe I'll add those 2 tickets to the agenda so that we don't forget about them
[13:41:55] <DaveMethvin> sure, sounds good. they've been broken for a long time so at least it isn't a regression
[13:42:20] <m_gol> yes, that's what's making me a little calmer about that ;)
[13:42:58] <DaveMethvin> and really, we could close it wontfix if it's too hard
[13:45:05] <m_gol> nah, the bug was that .css('left') sometimes returns pixels in Webkit
[13:45:24] <m_gol> but in fixing this bug the question of what to do with position: static occured
[13:45:48] <m_gol> so it seems we lean towards just not putting any code that deals specially with this case, making the result undefined
[13:45:52] <m_gol> I'm fine with that
[13:45:59] <m_gol> but we should document it under .css :)
[13:46:28] <DaveMethvin> agreed .. once we get agreement
[13:46:30] <m_gol> * undefined -> unspecified
[13:46:37] <m_gol> (here, I redefined undefined)
[13:47:10] <m_gol> too bad I forgot about it during the meeting :)
[13:47:18] <m_gol> and we want to have beta before the next one
[13:47:27] <DaveMethvin> there's always next week, and there can be more betas!
[13:47:38] <DaveMethvin> i just want to get something out there and announce what we did so far
[13:47:39] <DaveMethvin> which is a lot
[13:47:46] <m_gol> yes, true
[13:48:13] <m_gol> you're right, since it's broken now it's not that we can't fix it between beta.1 & beta.2 :)
[13:52:03] <m_gol> could you create a 1.next/2.next milestone? some tickets would belong there rather than under 1.next or 2.next
[13:52:12] <DaveMethvin> sure
[13:52:55] <DaveMethvin> done
[13:53:15] <m_gol> thx
[13:58:25] <m_gol> separate milestones for 1.11 and 2.1 would be nice as well ;)
[14:00:31] <DaveMethvin> yep, added those
[14:00:53] <m_gol> ta
[14:55:22] <mikesherov> here
[14:55:28] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I was summoned?
[14:55:50] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov wondered about your opinion on a couple of pull reqs
[14:56:15] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1298
[14:56:15] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Pull request #1298 by b1lly (2mon 3w ago): fixes .css() #13956
[14:56:30] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1241
[14:56:30] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Pull request #1241 by yiminghe (5mon 2d ago): make left/top auto value consistent across browsers
[14:56:50] <DaveMethvin> should we try to actually fix position: static there or just document it as not defined
[14:57:04] <mikesherov> I think we should fix position static
[14:57:13] <mikesherov> I don't like fixing left/right/bottom/top
[14:57:50] <DaveMethvin> can you add some comments with your thoughts?
[14:57:56] <DaveMethvin> we're gonna discuss next meeting
[14:58:11] <mikesherov> sure
[14:58:17] <mikesherov> will do
[17:51:42] <Krinkle> m_gol: DaveMethvin: jzaefferer: JamesMGreene: orkel: Following up on a recent meeting, TestSwarm and SauceLabs are not mutually exclusive. TestSwarm is the distributor, currently backed by browserstack. The idea is to (if feasible and worth it) replace TestSwarm with a command-line only grunt plugin, which would be backed by saucelabs, but it can just as easily be backed by browserstack and saucelabs toge
[17:51:42] <Krinkle> ther.
[17:52:16] <Krinkle> The reason Android 2.3 (or whatever) works now is because of BrowserStack, not TestSwarm.
