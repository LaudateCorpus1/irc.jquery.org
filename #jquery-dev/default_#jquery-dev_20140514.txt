[10:39:00] <danheberden_> scott_gonzalez: is it possible to disable the scrollTo behaviour of a selected tab in jqueryui?
[10:39:58] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean?
[10:40:41] <danheberden_> if a jquery ui tab is out of screen and it's selected/opened programatically, it scrolls into view
[10:40:54] <danheberden_> at least it seems to be doing that?
[10:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:41:38] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check
[10:42:31] <danheberden_> ok i think i was wrong in that it's not doing that
[10:42:44] <danheberden_> i was trying it via keyboard nav which might be the browser itself
[10:42:51] <danheberden_> when i fire click on a tab element
[10:42:54] <danheberden_> it doesn't do any scrolling
[10:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, it doesn't scroll at all on programmatic focus.
[10:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well keyboard nav is going to scroll because of focus changing.
[10:44:14] <danheberden_> ok, that makes sense
[10:44:42] <danheberden_> having a weird issue we're trying to sort out where we select a tab and move focus inside of that tab, and then after that, the page scrolls to the top of the tabs
[10:45:02] <danheberden_> so i'll keep digging into it. thanks for your time :)
[12:15:35] <gnarf> danheberden_: is there a hash link #id "scrollto" happening?
[12:16:06] <gnarf> something else kicking off a url change that points to an id that is?
[13:33:52] <danheberden_> gnarf, some weird client that hosted their own file of jquery and had custom code to augment scroll
[13:34:02] <danheberden_> people surprise me
[13:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> That's pretty funny.
