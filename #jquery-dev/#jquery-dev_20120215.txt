[05:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> WOOHOO
[05:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> I like jq-jenkins' enthusiasm :-)
[06:08:37] <jzaefferer> so I ended up running Firefox 10 myself, need to figure out why BrowserStack didn't provide that one
[06:08:54] <jzaefferer> other then that, its working great, even helped find a IE issue

[06:41:08] <jqcommit> [qunit/master] Serialize expected and actual values only when test fails. Speeds up output of valid tests, especially for lots of large objects. Fixes #183 - Jörn Zaefferer
[06:41:08] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's not in the integration.
[06:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> According to https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack/blob/master/testswarm-browserstack.js we're only running 3.6 and 7.0
[06:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> I've got ideas for this, but I have no idea how to test the integration.
[06:43:09] <jzaefferer> Okay, that makes sense
[06:43:26] <jzaefferer> so yeah, we need to know how to run that script, and how to test it

[06:59:19] <jqcommit> [qunit/master] Remove the testEnviromentArg to test(). Most obscure, never used anywhere. test() is still heavily overloaded with argument shifting, this makes it a little more sane. Fixes #172 - Jörn Zaefferer
[07:05:42] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin rwaldron: that last commit may break something in core, in case my search-fu is really bad and I missed something. Though as far as I can tell, nothing was using that weird testEnviromentArg anyway. Would have had to look like this: test("name", { some object }, function() { ...
[07:06:45] <rwaldron> jzaefferer I'll check it out
[07:06:50] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: I don't think we have any of those ... I didn't even know it was possible!
[07:06:52] <rwaldron> thanks for the heads up
[07:07:02] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: that's why I've removed it
[07:07:05] <rwaldron> (also, +1 to what DaveMethvin said)
[07:07:09] <jzaefferer> most obscure feature ever
[07:07:11] <rwaldron> but I'll check anyway
[07:07:13] <DaveMethvin> so now it's unpossible!
[07:07:18] <jzaefferer> there even was a test for it

[08:57:16] <jzaefferer> Actually still one open bug that wasn't labelled...
[11:03:51] <clarkbox> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer: added FF10 to testswarm-browserstack
[11:04:10] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: nice
[11:04:18] <clarkbox> ill move the mapping into a separate file this weekend
[11:04:26] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: so, how do you start/stop that thing?
[11:04:38] <clarkbox> right now, i have it running via screen
[11:04:48] <clarkbox> but that was for debug
[11:04:56] <clarkbox> im ready to move it to cron now
[11:06:57] <clarkbox> started on documenting the implementation details: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/testswarm-browserstack-integration
[14:59:06] <mikesherov> .
[15:13:16] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: can I ask you a quick question?
[15:14:06] <mikesherov> I promise it'll be quick... what tool do you use to get the commit history for jquery to look so nice in github?
[15:14:35] <mikesherov> Most histories have the commit itself plus the merge commit in the history
[15:15:06] <mikesherov> I'm looking for my own projects to be able to remove the merge commit from the history and have author/committer information in one single commit
[15:18:19] <mikesherov> is it pulley?
[16:10:24] <DaveMethvin> ?tell mikesherov I do it the real man's way, either a cherry-pick or a merge --no-commit --squash, then touch up and a commit -a --author "their name"
[16:10:24] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, Okay.
