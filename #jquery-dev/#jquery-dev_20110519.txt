[06:14:39] <louisremi> Hi everybody
[06:16:08] <jaubourg> hey louisremi
[06:16:25] <louisremi> gnarf, jaubour: Is it a well known fact that jQuery can't animate opacity of inline elements in IE? http://jsfiddle.net/xca9g/3/
[06:18:12] <louisremi> Well, it's not only unable to animate, but also unable to simple change it using .css
[06:19:14] <jaubourg> have you tried setting a background to its parent?
[06:19:29] <louisremi> Will try
[06:19:50] <jaubourg> I know IE is very stupid with opacity
[06:20:12] <jaubourg> also, louisremi, you realize you're probably in for an effectsRewrite? :P
[06:20:56] <louisremi> I had a look at the spreadsheet yes ;-)
[06:21:02] <jaubourg> :P
[06:21:14] <louisremi> But I think it's too early to add transitions to jQuery
[06:21:38] <jaubourg> not sure about that... at the very least, we should prepare the architecture to support them
[06:21:51] <jaubourg> so the jump to adding them in is not that far
[06:21:57] <louisremi> Yes, I'm already trying to do that
[06:22:06] <jaubourg> figured
[06:22:17] <louisremi> I had no luck with you background trick
[06:22:26] <jaubourg> and on the elements themselves?
[06:22:34] <louisremi> I'll try with another library to see if it's feasible
[06:22:38] <louisremi> will try that too
[06:22:52] <jaubourg> I had terrible experiences with IE not changing opacity on elements with no background
[06:23:04] <jaubourg> never understood the exact conditions
[11:59:27] <timmywil> hahaha http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6115#comment:6
[11:59:52] <timmywil> we don't support wow gold spam thanks
[14:30:26] <cmcnulty> wookiehangover: Is there anything I can do for #6782 (currently assigned to you)
[16:58:09] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: doc#9347
[16:59:52] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg:  so i'm just worried that we're looking to solve every "problem" that one person has with jquery
[17:00:30] <DaveMethvin> i am not even a fan of $.fn.load because it doesn't give a lot of control over errors, etc
[17:00:33] <jaubourg> I hear you, but I really had that in mind originally, hence why I made it possible to get the promise for something else than running animations ;)
[17:01:05] <jaubourg> I never use fn.load, mind you :P
[17:01:23] <DaveMethvin> well like i said if it can be done basically for free then fine, but we're bloating this code with all the little 4 or 5 line enhancements
[17:01:32] <DaveMethvin> that's imo of course
[17:01:43] <DaveMethvin> maybe others prefer features over size
[17:02:16] <jaubourg> we could also add a param and return the deferred is needs be
[17:02:20] <jaubourg> if
[17:02:30] <jaubourg> that would be like a line of code or so
[17:02:46] <jaubourg> but then again, is it that useful?
[17:02:54] <DaveMethvin> not that useful to me
[17:02:57] <jaubourg> at least you could handle errors
[17:03:13] <jaubourg> heh, I don't think I use the ajax helper a lot to be frank
[17:03:37] <DaveMethvin> since the other ajax helpers return a promise the rewrite actually made them potentially useful since now they can handle errors for example
[17:03:44] <DaveMethvin> that's a feature i can believe it
[17:03:46] <DaveMethvin> in
[17:04:13] <jaubourg> true
[17:04:54] <DaveMethvin> so we have got a massive feature list for 1.7, it's scaring me
[17:05:12] <jaubourg> that's incidently how the success/error methods idea came in (seeing as helpers would have needed another param to deal with errors otherwise)
[17:05:23] <jaubourg> yeah, daunting number of features
[17:05:33] <DaveMethvin> seems like we are in line for an animation rewrite ...  maybe it can get smaller?
[17:05:34] <DaveMethvin> hahaha
[17:05:40] <jaubourg> lol
[17:05:43] <jaubourg> dream on
[17:05:55] <jaubourg> but yeah, an effectsRewrite is on the horizon for sure
[17:07:00] <DaveMethvin> see, to me the effects stuff is something I'd love to see pulled out of core, so by default they just did a show/hide
[17:07:06] <DaveMethvin> but that's just me
[17:07:54] <jaubourg> I dunno, if we go this road, I'd reduce core to what we call core, deferreds, data and sizzle
[17:08:01] <jaubourg> events
[17:08:03] <jaubourg> arf
[17:08:17] <DaveMethvin> in my dreams i would like to see sizzle replaced by a thin wrapper on qSA
[17:08:35] <jaubourg> wish it was possible
[17:08:44] <jaubourg> when will IE7- die?
[17:09:15] <DaveMethvin> that's the problem, isn't it
[17:09:30] <jaubourg> what I'd love to see is all the helper methods (for events, dom manip, ajax, etc) be deported into separate official plugins
[17:09:58] <DaveMethvin> it's really just a waste of time to refactor stuff if everyone ends up needing/wanting them
[17:10:07] <DaveMethvin> but if we gave enough notice i think we might be able to remove some stuff
[17:10:14] <DaveMethvin> that's what i'd like to do in 2.0
[17:10:37] <gnarf> effects is gonna be hard to make awesome while maintaining 100% back compat
[17:10:44] <jaubourg> well, I'm making ajaxHooks for a reason... a lot of stuff in ajax could be refactored using prefilters
[17:11:09] <jaubourg> ifModified for instance
[17:11:22] <DaveMethvin> there's an easy way to maintain 100% back compat, just keep adding code and never take anything out :(
[17:11:33] <jaubourg> yeah :(
[17:11:53] <jaubourg> but really, ajax helpers can live on a plugin of their own
[17:12:22] <DaveMethvin> we need to be brutal about feature requests, they need to be either really popular or make core itself easier to use or faster
[17:12:25] <jaubourg> hell, script and jsonp could be removed as ther are
[17:12:36] <jaubourg> they
[17:13:07] <jaubourg> we need to be brutal about them or we need to start thinking of jQuery as a more compact core with official plugins (ahem modules)
[17:13:35] <jaubourg> truth is we cannot continue like we do now, that's for sure
[17:14:36] <DaveMethvin> and the reception of  1.6 doesn't mean can't break things ... it's an example of how we need to be clear and give advanced notice on breaking changes
[17:15:16] <jaubourg> hell, 1.5 broke a lot of things ajax-wide but with simple enough alternatives
[17:15:26] <jaubourg> especially in the dataFilter/converter area
[17:15:35] <jaubourg> problem is to document this kind of stuff properly
[17:16:29] <gnarf> I could write essays on breaking changes I'd love to make to animate and queue :)
[17:16:48] <DaveMethvin> well let's define jQuery 2.0 as we'd like to see it and then work so that 1.7/8/9 work towards that, and change api.jquery.com to reflect that today
[17:17:01] <jaubourg> +1
[17:17:47] <DaveMethvin> so like, there is no reason for anyone to use $(document).attr("location", "http://...") and if it worked in the past that doesn't matter
[17:18:14] <jaubourg> people do that? for real?
[17:18:18] <tbranyen> lol
[17:18:22] <tbranyen> wow
[17:18:25] <DaveMethvin> lemme see if i can find the ticket ... blew me away
[17:18:27] <gnarf> jaubourg: you don't lurk #jquery often do you?
[17:18:39] <jaubourg> gnarf: I avoid it like the plague
[17:18:46] <jaubourg> maybe I need some reality check
[17:18:50] <jaubourg> but it depresses me
[17:19:52] <DaveMethvin> docs#8875
[17:20:17] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8875
[17:20:22] <DaveMethvin> lazy ass bot
[17:20:51] <gnarf> http://oksoclap.com/effects-proposal
[17:53:57] <eddiemonge> .css('opacity', '.5') sets alpha and not opacity in IE7?
[17:55:16] <DaveMethvin> eddiemonge: ie7 doesn't support css opacity right?
[17:55:21] <DaveMethvin> so it uses a filter
[18:07:28] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: you should take a look at http://oksoclap.com/effects-proposal
[18:08:01] <jaubourg> see Examples down the mess we made with gnarf ;)
[18:41:45] <jaubourg> I hate my ISP
[18:43:58] <jaubourg> JohnResig: you're very quiet ;)
[18:50:33] <gnarf> dave didn't have much to say either
[18:50:34] <gnarf> :/
[18:52:44] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, jaubourg: it's like when my wife asks which dress i like better
[18:52:59] <DaveMethvin> i don't know much about it, and can only get in trouble
[18:53:00] <jaubourg> yeah, well, let's shape the proposal... what's nice is that we can probably start by doing this as a plugin
[18:53:09] <gnarf> jaubourg++
[18:53:16] <gnarf> jaubourg: ui.effects.core ?
[18:53:17] <DaveMethvin> but i can tell you guys FOR SURE that it doesn't make either of you look fat
[18:53:32] <DaveMethvin> i like the idea of doing a plugin
[18:53:43] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: what T-Shirt do you think I should wear tomorrow? AND DON'T ASK AS IF YOU DIDN'T HEAR ME!
[18:53:47] <DaveMethvin> like, maybe it could start that way and be its own compat plugin?
[18:53:54] <jaubourg> ask = act
[18:53:58] <gnarf> lets play in plugin land for a bit tho
[18:54:03] <DaveMethvin> lalalala didn't hear you
[18:54:06] <gnarf> i think thats the winning idea
[18:54:09] <jaubourg> hahahaha
[18:54:53] <jaubourg> yeah, make the anim thingy and see how to redefine animate later on though deferreds appear to make the whole thing a lot simpler actually
[18:55:11] <jaubourg> just need to determine when to handle unqueue
[18:55:19] <jaubourg> dequeue I mean
[18:55:31] <jaubourg> ph well, queue emptying... getting late
[18:56:11] <gnarf> jaubourg: :)
[18:56:26] <gnarf> next( gotoEnd ) ?
[18:56:32] <gnarf> pass it onto the queues responsibility?
[18:56:50] <jaubourg> I'd like the queue to stay a mindless beast somehow
[18:56:56] <gnarf> though it really is more of an animation specific thing
[18:57:02] <jaubourg> trick is to know who should attach the queue handling callback
[18:57:28] <jaubourg> more about responsibility than anything else really and there may not be a better choice
[18:57:45] <gnarf> animate queues are the only stoppable ones anyway
[18:57:57] <jaubourg> true
[18:58:04] <gnarf> so if the anim deferred handles it...
[18:58:20] <jaubourg> fn.stop can be put into effects.js
[18:58:24] <jaubourg> ;)
[18:58:36] <gnarf> yes
[18:58:46] <gnarf> it isn't already?
[18:59:03] <gnarf> other than clearing queue - it doesn't have anything to do with queue... we should move that
[18:59:03] <jaubourg> I think it's in queue.js but I may be wrong
[18:59:18] <jaubourg> checking
[18:59:27] <gnarf> nope its in effects
[18:59:36] <jaubourg> ok, my bad
[18:59:52] <gnarf> actually
[18:59:54] <gnarf> interestingly
[19:00:07] <gnarf> you'll gain the ability to stop all animation on the element
[19:00:12] <gnarf> across all queues
[19:01:00] <jaubourg> we could add a queue id string as an optional parameter if we wanna have named queues
[19:01:17] <gnarf> don't need to since the timer has its queue in opts
[19:01:26] <jaubourg> heh, true
[19:01:46] <gnarf> i would store the "queue" the timer is in
[19:01:48] <gnarf> for sure
[19:02:23] <jaubourg> anyway, gotta rest a little
[19:02:30] <jaubourg> 4am again :/
[19:02:43] * jaubourg spanks himself
[19:02:44] <gnarf> gotoEnd becomes pretty simple -- if reject( true ) --- you call progress(1) one last time before dying
[19:02:55] <jaubourg> heh
[19:02:59] <gnarf> progress is easing
[19:03:30] <jaubourg> for now, methods for progress handling on deferred are as follows: ping/pingWith to notify, progress to attach a callback
[19:03:46] <gnarf> ping(1) then
[19:03:52] <jaubourg> heh
[19:03:55] <gnarf> can you .ping(1) after .reject(true) ?
[19:04:16] <jaubourg> no, but I think we'll add a stop method a-la jqXHR complete
[19:04:31] <gnarf> jaubourg: yeah, .ping(1).reject(true)
[19:04:33] <gnarf> :)
[19:04:37] <jaubourg> yep
[19:06:00] <gnarf> we might not even need the method...
[19:06:00] <gnarf> but it would keep things hidden i guess
[19:06:00] <gnarf> timer should know stop...
[19:06:00] <gnarf> that makes more than enough sense
[19:06:00] <gnarf> actually - is gotoEnd going to be a reject?
[19:06:17] <gnarf> i think its allPropertyAnims.ping(1).resolve();
[19:06:36] <jaubourg> yeah, could be handled with a resolve
[19:07:02] <gnarf> clearQueue could just be done in .fn.stop() like it is now
[19:07:29] <jaubourg> I dunno, I like the idea of clearing the queue in the same part of the code that created it
[19:07:40] <jaubourg> if you see what I mean
[19:08:09] <gnarf> I do -- but if its gonna be resolve one way, reject the other...
[19:08:31] <gnarf> $.fn.stop = function( clearQueue, gotoEnd ) {
[19:08:43] <gnarf> the clearQueue is just .queue([]);
[19:08:52] <gnarf> or .queue().empty()
[19:08:57] <gnarf> if we redecorate em
[19:09:16] <gnarf> eh - i said i was done thinking
[19:09:20] <gnarf> but i obviously wasnt
[19:09:22] <jaubourg> hehehe
[19:09:25] * gnarf walks away for realz
[19:09:29] <jaubourg> I have to sleep anyway
[19:09:35] <jaubourg> night gnarf, Dave
