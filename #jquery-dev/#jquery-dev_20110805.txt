[06:25:12] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron thanks for catching those unclosed tix and adding the new ones
[06:25:26] <rwaldron> oh... no problem
[06:25:26] <bot-t> (12 mins 40 secs ago) <erichynds> tell rwaldron this site is a good bookmark as well http://www.open-video.org/
[06:25:43] <rwaldron> i was actually just cleaning up my own mess
[06:25:57] <rwaldron> i should've added a ticket for the min license stuff
[06:26:09] <rwaldron> and I'm just going through my tickets right now
[06:26:38] <rwaldron> that ticket i closed as fixed, re: data... I should've closed as a duplicate actually :\
[06:28:07] <DaveMethvin> well as long as it's FIXED!
[06:29:21] <peol> :o
[06:32:52] <rwaldron> ...I'll fix you...
[06:32:54] <rwaldron> ;)
[07:24:19] <timmywil> .
[07:25:35] <DaveMethvin> geez! jQuery 1.6.3, code-named "rwaldron"
[07:26:17] <DaveMethvin> we're only 12 bugs away from 10000
[07:26:24] <DaveMethvin> is that good or bad?
[07:27:14] <DaveMethvin> i hope #10000 isn't some lame spam ticket
[07:27:33] <timmywil> wouldn't get your hopes up
[07:28:04] <DaveMethvin> i started working in the bug tracker when we were in the 1000s
[07:28:07] <DaveMethvin> get off my lawn
[07:28:09] <timmywil> Although, I'm hoping jon neal submits something for 10000
[07:35:24] <DaveMethvin> whoa! I filed my first jQuery bug 5 years and 2 days ago: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/118
[07:35:26] <rwaldron> Hey dudes
[07:35:33] <DaveMethvin> hey
[07:35:35] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin: NICE!
[07:35:54] <rwaldron> so, we should address those test suite issues ASAP
[07:36:00] <rwaldron> i've fixed the core issues
[07:36:03] <DaveMethvin> oh the ones you just opened?
[07:36:20] <rwaldron> but there is a problem in sizzle's selector tests, it's not a big deal
[07:36:30] <rwaldron> its actually harmless
[07:36:33] <rwaldron> just looks bad
[07:36:37] <rwaldron> know what i mean?
[07:37:59] <rwaldron> btw, how about that support for numbers in data props, fixed in 11 characters
[07:38:03] * rwaldron dances
[07:38:31] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin was just curious... i noticed your pull/merge/land whatever is different from timmywil's?
[07:38:55] <DaveMethvin> For those, I did them from the github ui
[07:39:06] <timmywil> I use pulley
[07:39:10] <DaveMethvin> if they were complicated i would have used pulley or manually checked them first
[07:39:27] <timmywil> merge button is convenient tho
[07:39:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah but only if you trust the person making the pr
[07:39:42] <DaveMethvin> :)
[07:39:50] <DaveMethvin> OH MY GOD WHAT HAVE I DONE?
[07:40:20] <timmywil> lol
[07:40:29] <timmywil> dooooooooomed
[07:42:08] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: on pull 456 do we have some tests for cases like "mydata-3"? I noticed pull 455 has test cases but none with digits
[07:42:23] <rwaldron> one sec

[07:43:38] <DaveMethvin> so you want I should land these?
[07:44:36] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://bit.ly/nkis31

[07:49:59] <rwaldron> hahaha
[07:50:08] <rwaldron> GTFOMPQ
[08:11:50] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i was about to write a test for docs#9989
[08:11:51] <bot-t> [#9989] $.each doesn't check for null (assigned enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/9989
[08:12:19] <rwaldron> and i realized... this likely falls under the umbrella of not patching every stupid edge case
[08:12:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[08:12:44] <rwaldron> ok
[08:12:46] <rwaldron> closing.
[08:13:00] <DaveMethvin> if you pass $.each(null ...) I think we should remove all your event handlers
[08:13:36] <DaveMethvin> it's easily fixed with $.each(whatever || {}, ...)
[08:13:50] <DaveMethvin> i could swear this is a dup
[08:13:58] <DaveMethvin> but in any case, yeah closed
[08:14:27] <rwaldron> maybe it is dup
[08:14:29] <rwaldron> seems it
[08:14:32] <rwaldron> i'll search
[08:15:05] <rwaldron> yikes
[08:15:09] <rwaldron> very much a dup
[08:15:13] <rwaldron> its reported once a week
[08:15:17] <rwaldron> not really.
[08:15:19] <rwaldron> but seems so
[08:31:00] <louisremi> I blogged about docs#9381 problem on hacks.mozilla.org, by the way: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2011/08/animating-with-javascript-from-setinterval-to-requestanimationframe/
[08:31:01] <bot-t> [#9381] animations halt when the browser is out of focus due to requestAnimationFrame (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9381
[08:57:00] <DaveMethvin> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=652472#c27
[08:59:02] <timmywil> just got my plane ticket for the conf.  They're pretty cheap right now.
[08:59:21] <timmywil> about half what I was going to pay for the triage
[09:04:18] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: Got my tix last week, $99.40 !!
[10:38:36] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: nice, better than mine
[10:39:46] <aaronmcadam> hey guys are any of you gonna make it to http://2011.full-frontal.org/ in november?
[10:40:56] <DaveMethvin> Nov 11 is my birthday ... will you have cake?
[10:41:33] <DaveMethvin> Also, it will be 11/11/11 !!!!!1
[10:41:40] <aaronmcadam> haha awesome :D
[10:42:03] <aaronmcadam> sounds like a prophecy will come true or something haha
[10:42:44] <DaveMethvin> wasn't planning on coming, but i'll take a look
[10:42:59] <DaveMethvin> aaronmcadam: you should pay timmywil's way over
[10:43:19] <aaronmcadam> well it's sold out, you need to get a workshop place that comes with a free pass
[10:43:32] <aaronmcadam> got mine today, day 2 of the nodejs workshop
[10:44:24] <DaveMethvin> damn sold out already?
[10:45:20] <aaronmcadam> yeah was only £120
[10:45:31] <aaronmcadam> I'm pissed off I missed out on naconf, it was only £100
[10:45:36] <aaronmcadam> was really great last year
[10:45:44] <aaronmcadam> or i mean this year haha
[10:46:06] <DaveMethvin> they need a bigger conf or a higher price if they're selling out that far in advance
[10:46:20] <aaronmcadam> ah nooo
[10:46:24] <aaronmcadam> not the higher price
[10:46:34] <aaronmcadam> it was cool cuz it wasn't huge
[11:36:07] <gnarf> wow, i think that was the most github inbox notifications I've ever had
[11:36:15] <gnarf> all that discussion on raf
[11:36:50] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you think I should alter that pull to put the flag on jQuery.support instead of jQuery.fx ?
[11:37:06] <gnarf> i think putting it on support might be a little more code
[11:37:21] <gnarf> just cuz all that raf stuff is already in fx.js
[11:37:42] <DaveMethvin> we'll just move the detect to support.js tho, right?
[11:38:40] <DaveMethvin> it seems natural to put the detect in support
[11:39:15] <DaveMethvin> trying to think of downsides...
[11:42:40] <gnarf> the detect is the same method to get the actual function tho
[11:43:45] <DaveMethvin> oic gnarf, you're saying if the detect is a boolean we need a new variable?
[11:43:52] <gnarf> so unless you want to duplicate the effort, you're going to end up storing a function on support instead of true/false
[11:44:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[11:44:09] <DaveMethvin> i guess by convention we have been doing booleans for support
[11:44:22] <DaveMethvin> can't think of a benefit to assigning a function
[11:44:23] <gnarf> if we knew effects was catted after support
[11:44:31] <gnarf> effects could add to support
[11:44:43] <DaveMethvin> unless someone wanted to provide a custom rAF function ... er is that a feature? :P
[11:46:03] <DaveMethvin> I'd keep the .support.raf as a boolean and then set up a var for it, but yeah we need to be sure the .support stuff runs earlier
[11:47:20] <DaveMethvin> do they get included in the order of BASE_FILES in the Makefile? If so we're good
[11:47:32] <gnarf> my reasoning for dumping it on .fx. now becomes more clear
[11:47:38] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: they should
[11:47:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah looks like it in the ${JQ} target
[11:48:09] <gnarf> i figured the flag is a part of the effects module, it makes sense for it to be on the effects module
[11:48:47] <gnarf> jQuery.fx.off ... jQuery.fx.raf ... jQuery.fx.interval are all kinda user configurable
[11:49:01] <DaveMethvin> i was gonna say it's easier to document on .support since we already have an api page for it :)
[11:49:10] <DaveMethvin> but otoh we do document those
[11:50:31] <DaveMethvin> but then it will need its own private new page like http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.fx.off/
[11:50:43] <DaveMethvin> rather than being a paragraph in an existing page
[11:50:57] <DaveMethvin> pro and con i guess, it's more visible as its own page
[11:51:12] <DaveMethvin> but easier to disavow if it's a paragraph in .support
[11:52:06] <DaveMethvin> ya know, i'm good with jQuery.fx.raf
[11:53:08] <DaveMethvin> really the only thing we will support on it is setting to null i guess to turn off rAF
[11:53:31] <DaveMethvin> and document it needs to be done before any animations i guess?
[11:53:36] <gnarf> yup and yup
[11:59:40] <ryanneufeld> do you guys have a tool you use for formatting code that has already been written? or do you just hand hack it all to meet the spec?
[12:00:09] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i have a perl oneliner to convert spaces -> tabs and empty "whitespace lines"
[12:00:25] <gnarf> but beyond that, all the internal whitespacing i do by hand
[12:00:46] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's what I'm looking for
[12:28:44] <gnarf> hrm
[12:28:50] <gnarf> speaking of rAF i think we have an issue
[12:29:35] <gnarf> we are getting a "not enough arguments" in canary when calling requestAnimationFrame: http://jsfiddle.net/ttREE/1/
[12:31:27] <gnarf> so chrome canary will NOT animate anything using jQuery atm ;)
[12:31:43] <paul_irish> lemme give u the ticket #
[12:32:02] <paul_irish> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=91687
[12:34:13] <aaronmcadam> oh hey paul you alrighty?
[12:35:45] <gnarf> thx paul_irish added a note about it stopping every site using jQuery 1.5 from animating
[12:35:57] <paul_irish> lol ok
[12:36:11] <gnarf> maybe it'll light a fire ;)
[12:36:26] <paul_irish> i pri-1'd it
[12:36:37] <gnarf> yer pro
[12:49:17] <gnarf> so, i guess today is a no canary day if i want to test effects
[12:49:19] * gnarf grins
