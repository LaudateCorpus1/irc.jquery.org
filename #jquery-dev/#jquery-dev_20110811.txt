[08:32:58] <Krinkle> Anyone here know about api.jquery.com worpress theme ? As of recently there's a bug in the stylesheet causing the description to be in Times New Roman
[08:33:19] <Krinkle> .api-jquery-com #jq-primaryContent .entry-details p.desc { font-family: "myriad pro";
[08:33:28] <Krinkle> not every computer has that font, let alone under that particular ID
[08:34:14] <kswedberg> weird. not sure how that got put in there.
[08:34:57] <Krinkle> http://i.imgur.com/jRUOT.png
[08:35:00] <kswedberg> Krinkle: I'll fix.
[08:37:30] <kswedberg> hello bot-t
[08:37:31] <bot-t> Hey kswedberg
[08:40:08] <kswedberg> Krinkle, try now. you might have to clear your browser cache.
[08:40:25] <Krinkle> nice
[08:40:27] <Krinkle> Thx
[08:41:00] <kswedberg> sure thing. :)
[08:43:36] <MrNibbles> i have an off-topic question
[08:43:40] <MrNibbles> but you lot are smart gents
[08:43:59] <MrNibbles> if no-one objects i will go ahead :)
[08:44:19] <MrNibbles> anyone know where the IE9 user agent stylesheet is located?
[10:45:38] <timmywil> jrburke: looking at it closer, it turns out I wasn't actually including those internally defined modules.  The define of the troublesome module ended up looking like this in the built file: define("enroll-panels/err", ["require", "exports", "module"],
[10:45:54] <timmywil> not sure what that means, but excluding it still worked fine
[10:46:25] <danheberden> did y'all see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/c1dcad69427b78f3e70628ab1444f42033ee593a#commitcomment-526601
[10:46:26] <socialhapy> http://bit.ly/pzvq86 jaubourg (5 months ago) on jquery: Rewrite of the support module. We use a temporary body element in order not to have to wait for the document to be ready for boxModel-related support tests.
[10:46:46] <danheberden> is this something that needs to be pulled from docs?
[10:49:51] <timmywil> danheberden: probably.  I don't think it was needed after 1.5
[11:04:28] <danheberden> just weird we'd delete something when not even deprecating it
[11:04:45] <danheberden> or, like, mention it
[11:09:27] <kswedberg> danheberden: what was deleted?
[11:25:24] <timmywil> danheberden: yea I'm not sure.  I understand it getting overlooked cause I'm not even sure what it's testing for.
[11:25:32] <timmywil> kswedberg: jQuery.support.scriptEval
[11:25:48] <danheberden> oh, sry kswedberg didn't see the highlight
[11:25:49] <timmywil> heh
[11:25:57] * danheberden unhides dock
[11:26:33] <kswedberg> no prob
[11:53:44] <AzaToth> anyone got any good ideas to (re)create a gettext compatible system under js/jq which is as optimal as possible and as compatible as posible with the real deal?
[11:54:48] <AzaToth> Frippe: use server auth
[11:55:05] <Frippe> Din't find that in macirssi
[11:55:29] <AzaToth> Frippe: not even something like "Server password"?
[11:56:02] <Frippe> nope
[11:56:19] <AzaToth> I see that the beta might have it
[11:57:37] <Frippe> okey, should look at the beta then
[12:21:07] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin thanks for writing up that clarification
[12:21:34] <DaveMethvin> np, just last night i was thinking about what a rats nest we've created there
[12:22:02] <DaveMethvin> and like i said in the pull req, i don't know whether to back out or keep going
[12:22:07] <DaveMethvin> but either will be a mess
[12:22:32] <rwaldron> I was thinking in the car about a jQuery.fn.data() implementation
[12:22:41] <rwaldron> but i didnt think miuch about it
[12:22:45] <rwaldron> because i hate the idea
[12:23:09] <DaveMethvin> we just have two very different ideas of data attachment frankensteined into a single api
[12:23:20] <rwaldron> i write commercial web software for clients that pay bocoup tens of thousands of dollars and i have never needed this
[12:23:33] <rwaldron> and im ok with using my experience as a baseline
[12:23:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:23:54] <rwaldron> additionally
[12:24:18] <rwaldron> the removeData() ticket is a different story
[12:24:27] <rwaldron> jQuery.fn.removeData()
[12:24:33] <jaubourg> yeah, I always use proper scope and closures and never needed to add data on the dom myself
[12:24:45] <jaubourg> and hi Dave, hi Rick
[12:24:48] <DaveMethvin> hey!
[12:24:49] <rwaldron> hi jaubourg
[12:24:51] <rwaldron> <3
[12:25:00] <jaubourg> rwaldron: I'll be on vacation in October... \o/
[12:25:05] <rwaldron> awesome
[12:25:12] <DaveMethvin> jQuery UI makes heavy use of .data() for attaching data
[12:25:13] <jaubourg> so I'll have all the time in the world to be with you guys
[12:25:18] <DaveMethvin>  jQuery Mobile makes heavy use of the importation of data- attrs so it would be hard to pry the two apart entirely
[12:25:18] <rwaldron> you need to talk to boaz btw
[12:25:25] <rwaldron> about accomodations
[12:25:28] <jaubourg> yeah
[12:25:35] <jaubourg> dang, what's his email addy?
[12:25:51] <DaveMethvin> boaz@bocoup.com?
[12:25:51] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yeah, but for that specific ticket
[12:25:57] <rwaldron> jaubourg: ^
[12:26:05] <jaubourg> k, thanks
[12:26:12] <rwaldron> it is totally weird that yu can't remove the data
[12:26:20] <rwaldron> but again... I have never had need for it
[12:26:23] <rwaldron> not sure why
[12:26:32] <rwaldron> but i havent
[12:26:45] <rwaldron> i think i write a lot of brute force code
[12:26:48] <DaveMethvin> in a world where .data() didn't mess with data- attrs you'd just use removeAttribute
[12:26:50] <rwaldron> that just DOES IT
[12:27:08] <DaveMethvin> and to get the mostest freshest value you'd use .attr
[12:27:09] <rwaldron> i also think i do alot of value integrity checking
[12:27:52] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin the problem in that ticket is that
[12:28:02] <rwaldron> the data is being removed from the internal cache
[12:28:03] <jaubourg> mail sent
[12:28:10] <rwaldron> but not from the element
[12:28:16] <rwaldron> so next time you go looking for it...
[12:28:23] <rwaldron> it appears to be there again
[12:28:40] <DaveMethvin> no, b/c we are going to cache that value
[12:28:46] <DaveMethvin> i haven't made that commit yet tho
[12:28:58] <rwaldron> hm
[12:28:58] <DaveMethvin> see the ticket i linked in that long post
[12:29:14] <DaveMethvin> and again, i don't know whether that improves or degrades things
[12:29:27] <rwaldron> i see
[12:29:32] <DaveMethvin> i see your pt about removeAttr, but it again moves us closer to a world where we try to treat them the same, even though they're not
[12:29:44] <rwaldron> i think it might also be time to consider using .dataset under the hood
[12:29:57] <rwaldron> a majority of our supported browsers have implemented it
[12:30:10] <rwaldron> i say we start using it like qSA
[12:30:21] <DaveMethvin> and fallback to cache only for ie6/7/8?
[12:30:32] <rwaldron> or whatever needs to happen
[12:30:34] <rwaldron> yeah
[12:30:50] <DaveMethvin> well it might be worth exploring i agree
[12:30:58] <DaveMethvin> also for those cases, we know it's safe to attach data to dom
[12:31:03] <DaveMethvin> so it cleans up after itself
[12:31:32] <rwaldron> indeed
[12:31:36] <rwaldron> in fact...
[12:31:49] <rwaldron> that might be how we feature test reliably
[12:32:00] <DaveMethvin> right
[12:32:08] <rwaldron> for attaching data to dom
[12:32:11] <DaveMethvin> although b/c we have special events, we still need to make a run thru the data to clean those up ... we can't just abandon the element
[12:32:19] <rwaldron> jQuery.support.icanhazdataset
[12:32:51] <rwaldron> btw, i need someone to review my outrageously awesome jQuery.support.fixedPosition ticket
[12:33:13] <DaveMethvin> someone must know about the position stuff better than me
[12:33:29] <DaveMethvin> cause i know i won't find any style probs
[12:35:16] <rwaldron> dude
[12:35:24] <rwaldron> you still have to see _HOW_ i did it
[12:35:30] * rwaldron dances
[12:35:35] * DaveMethvin looks now
[12:36:25] <rwaldron> https://github.com/rwldrn/jquery/tree/6809
[12:36:56] <DaveMethvin> ah thanks, lookign for a pr
[12:37:01] <rwaldron> nope, not yet
[12:37:05] <rwaldron> i wanted reviews first
[12:37:11] <rwaldron> and i wasnt sure if i was done yet either
[12:37:38] <rwaldron> no more jQuery.offset.initialize()
[12:37:48] <rwaldron> i reuse jaubourg's fake body :D
[12:37:53] <rwaldron> ready...
[12:37:55] * rwaldron dances
[12:38:28] <jaubourg> lol
[12:38:34] <DaveMethvin> well never use jaubourg's real body
[12:38:42] <rwaldron> then in the process, i discovered that the markup used in the test had huge strings repeated
[12:38:42] <DaveMethvin> it's too leaky
[12:38:47] <rwaldron> ew
[12:38:53] <jaubourg> ew
[12:38:59] <DaveMethvin> double ew
[12:39:14] <rwaldron> then i discovered that some browsers ahve a USABLE document.body
[12:39:19] <rwaldron> by the time that occurs
[12:39:24] <rwaldron> but inconsistently
[12:39:29] <rwaldron> but who cares??
[12:39:35] <rwaldron> i use it if possible
[12:39:40] <jaubourg> could explain some problems with have with background properties
[12:39:44] <rwaldron> if not, back to jaubourg's body
[12:40:02] * DaveMethvin is creeped out
[12:40:09] <rwaldron> and then...
[12:40:11] <jaubourg> oh, ic, I'm just there "in case"
[12:40:14] <jaubourg> THANK YOU RICK
[12:40:15] <rwaldron> https://github.com/rwldrn/jquery/commit/47997df20a23a928a9f8d7b2bd534f8535e2e6b3
[12:40:16] <socialhapy> http://bit.ly/pp7LzL rwldrn (3 weeks ago) on jquery: Reuse style string
[12:40:16] <rwaldron> BOOM
[12:40:19] * jaubourg runs away crying
[12:40:32] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg he just wants you for your fake body
[12:40:36] <rwaldron> reduced the amount of characters used significantl
[12:40:40] <rwaldron> significantly
[12:40:43] <jaubourg> Dave: I can see that now :/
[12:40:49] <DaveMethvin> zowie rwaldron i see what you mean
[12:40:54] <rwaldron> :D
[12:40:58] <DaveMethvin> HUGE tracts of code are gone
[12:41:11] <rwaldron> yep
[12:41:14] <rwaldron> 100% pass
[12:41:15] <DaveMethvin> good thing we have jaubourg to add bulk to 1.7 or the thing might float away
[12:41:18] * rwaldron dances
[12:41:38] <jaubourg> yeah, thank god I always add more bytes
[12:41:46] <jaubourg> we wouldn't be taken seriously otherwise
[12:42:07] <rwaldron> jaubourg i still want unique instance topics
[12:42:14] <rwaldron> i havent forgotten
[12:42:21] <jaubourg> rwaldron: you still haven't told me why
[12:42:24] <rwaldron> i will nag the shit out of you
[12:42:37] <jaubourg> you know I'm persistent, don't you?
[12:42:48] <DaveMethvin> so the new offset tests with the fake body pass totally?
[12:42:51] <DaveMethvin> that's nice
[12:42:51] <rwaldron> so that they are addressable by NOT using a string
[12:43:11] <jaubourg> why?
[12:43:17] <rwaldron> pretend "Foo" is a smart ctor that makes own instances
[12:43:20] <rwaldron> ready...
[12:43:42] <rwaldron> var f = Foo()
[12:44:07] <rwaldron> f.subscribe(function() {  console.log("Hello!") })
[12:44:12] <rwaldron> f.publish()
[12:44:21] <rwaldron> f.unsubscribe()
[12:44:24] <jaubourg> you can already do that
[12:44:25] <rwaldron> f==null; //true
[12:44:39] <jaubourg> Oo
[12:44:54] <jaubourg> ok, you lost me completely
[12:44:59] <jaubourg> I don't see you use-case
[12:45:02] <jaubourg> your
[12:45:18] <DaveMethvin> how did f get to be null?
[12:45:21] <rwaldron> topic.publish( "test" ); <-- yuck
[12:45:30] <jaubourg> I don't care much about the how or what. I care about the why
[12:45:30] <rwaldron> f.publish()
[12:45:45] <jaubourg> you can already do that
[12:46:00] <jaubourg> just like you can defer.resolve()
[12:46:44] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin f became null when i unsubscrib()'ed it
[12:47:07] <rwaldron> jaubourg let me look real wuick at the use case
[12:47:08] <jaubourg> I'm really lost here because I have honestly NO clue what you're trying to achieve and if it actually is not possible right now
[12:47:19] <rwaldron> that i came up with that couldnt be satisfied
[12:47:57] <DaveMethvin> there's a yo momma joke hanging around here
[12:49:15] <jaubourg> rwaldron: it really seems to me you're trying to use topics with another interface... which is fine but not the goal here
[12:49:27] <rwaldron> meh.
[12:49:31] <rwaldron> i cant remember why now
[12:49:35] <rwaldron> so whatever :(
[12:49:36] <jaubourg> haha
[12:49:53] <rwaldron> i swear, i found a case... i wish i could remember
[12:50:01] <rwaldron> bbiaf
[12:50:05] <jaubourg> k
[12:50:48] <rwaldron> jaubourg either way...
[12:50:52] <rwaldron> you love me right now
[12:51:14] <jaubourg> man, I'll always love you
[12:51:17] <rwaldron> now you won't have to rush to fix this...
[12:51:18] <jaubourg> you're awesome
[12:51:18] <rwaldron> git co master && git co -b 1.7/callbacks && git pull upstream 1.7/callbacks
[12:51:49] <jaubourg> I'll probably restart the 1.7/callbacks branch from scratch
[12:51:52] <rwaldron> http://pastie.org/2357394
[12:51:55] <jaubourg> btw, I need some naming advice
[12:52:04] <rwaldron> Topic +1
[12:52:20] <jaubourg> it's about progress in deferreds
[12:52:23] <rwaldron> oh
[12:52:35] <jaubourg> I wish to have progress together with resolve and reject
[12:53:06] <jaubourg> but to attach callbacks, I dunno... I came up with ping (as short as done and fail, quite simetric) but it sounds wrong somehow
[12:53:17] <jaubourg> I'd like something short and to the point but hell if I can find it
[12:53:43] <jaubourg> or doesn't it sound wrong?
[12:54:23] <jaubourg> (for now it's inversed in the branch -- progress and ping that is)
[12:57:00] <rwaldron> tell me about ping
[12:58:13] <jaubourg> well, it's quite simple really: var defer = $.Deferred(); defer.ping(function( value ) { console.log( value ); }); defer.progress( "hello" ) /* logs "hello" */; defer.progress( "world" ) /* logs "world" */;
[12:59:11] <jaubourg> does it look "right"?
[13:00:32] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: your input welcome too
[13:01:24] <DaveMethvin> so what does "ping" mean?
[13:01:36] <jaubourg> call me when there is progress
[13:01:37] <DaveMethvin> that's a progress callback?
[13:01:40] <jaubourg> yep
[13:01:54] <DaveMethvin> how bout sup() :P
[13:01:59] <jaubourg> haha
[13:02:09] <jaubourg> hey, defer, sup?
[13:02:26] <gnarf> notify ?
[13:02:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah i like that better than ping at least
[13:03:00] <gnarf> i like ping cuz its 4 letters and so is done and fail
[13:03:01] <gnarf> :)
[13:03:10] <DaveMethvin> well then sup is better
[13:03:11] <jaubourg> I was attempting to have something like done or fail
[13:03:22] <gnarf> done, fail, progress make sense
[13:03:27] <gnarf> resolve, reject, notify
[13:04:02] <jaubourg> heh
[13:04:08] <jaubourg> sounds good to everyone?
[13:05:01] <gnarf> done, fail, limbo
[13:05:04] <DaveMethvin> shoudl it be notify, or notice ?
[13:05:05] <gnarf> :)
[13:05:21] <DaveMethvin> we end  up using verbs as nouns and vice-versa so often
[13:05:35] <gnarf> resolve & reject are verbs
[13:06:04] <jaubourg> notify I like
[13:06:04] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking of done and fail
[13:06:11] * jaubourg hides
[13:06:22] <DaveMethvin> better than ping
[13:06:23] <jaubourg> my bad
[13:06:32] <DaveMethvin> well you gotta start with someting
[13:06:52] <DaveMethvin> the good thing about starting with something that sucks is we all can take credit for a better name
[13:06:56] <DaveMethvin> so now we bought into your plan
[13:07:08] <DaveMethvin> you are soooo devious
[13:07:09] <jaubourg> resolve, reject, notify / done, fail, progress?
[13:07:15] <jaubourg> bwahahahahahaha
[13:07:20] <gnarf> done, fail, progress / resolve, reject, notify / resolveWith, rejectWith, notifyWith
[13:07:33] <rwaldron> ping => talk
[13:07:37] <rwaldron> also 4 letters
[13:08:32] <rwaldron> tell
[13:08:38] <DaveMethvin> ooooh
[13:08:42] <rwaldron> blab
[13:08:48] <DaveMethvin> spew
[13:08:51] <rwaldron> tell +1
[13:08:57] <rwaldron> jaubourg ^
[13:09:34] <DaveMethvin> barf
[13:09:43] <rwaldron> meh
[13:09:54] <jaubourg> I dunno, I like notify but I'm uncertain about progress... it's long and feels weird... kinda like we're telling people: this is more complicated, beware
[13:10:02] <rwaldron> tell makes most semantic sense
[13:10:06] <jaubourg> but progress expresses the intent perfectly
[13:10:12] <DaveMethvin> not that anyone can change this now, but the fact that you have to know the word pairs is kind of a pain
[13:10:32] <DaveMethvin> resolve==>done etc
[13:11:01] <DaveMethvin> the more complex it gets the harder it is to keep it all straight
[13:11:10] <jaubourg> well, I could still have resolved and rejected as aliases... and have done and fail deprecated later on
[13:11:15] <rwaldron> var defer = $.Deferred(); defer.hear(function( value ) { console.log( value ); });
[13:11:15] <rwaldron> defer.tell( "hello" ) /* logs "hello" */; defer.tell( "world" ) /* logs "world" */;
[13:11:33] <gnarf> hrm
[13:11:39] <gnarf> hear...
[13:11:48] <gnarf> not bad
[13:11:59] <gnarf> i might lean that way instead of progress now
[13:12:00] <rwaldron> fuck it, listen()
[13:12:03] <rwaldron> that works too
[13:12:22] <jaubourg> we could have resolved, rejected and notified to bind, resolve, reject and notify to trigger and keep done & fail as shortcuts
[13:12:27] <rwaldron> ok, ajpiano is dne with android device, so i have to make sure client thingy works on it
[13:12:30] <jaubourg> not a big problem
[13:12:42] <rwaldron> btw, i've been standing in front of my desk for about 30 minutes
[13:12:47] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: ^
[13:12:48] <rwaldron> i think i'm going to try this
[13:13:03] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: my point prolly isn't too much of an issue
[13:13:14] <DaveMethvin> thinking of the mess with events
[13:13:37] <DaveMethvin> mainly it's a first-time-user thing
[13:13:41] <jaubourg> well, it's not too late to fix it really
[13:14:05] <DaveMethvin> it's never too late to break working code :P
[13:14:18] <rwaldron> So be good for goodness saaakkke whooooaaaaaa
[13:14:24] <rwaldron> somebodies comin'!
[13:14:33] <rwaldron> somebody's
[13:15:33] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: deferred methods are just free-to-move functions, so adding aliases to make things clear or for backward compat is a non-issue, really
[13:15:35] <rwaldron> http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087332/quotes#qt0475985
[13:15:39] * DaveMethvin thinks
[13:16:59] <DaveMethvin> i think we'll prolly just confuse people more if we change the names
[13:17:45] <jaubourg> k
[13:18:31] <DaveMethvin> so i think we have so many coats of paint on this bikeshed that it doesn't need a frame anymore
[13:19:09] <gnarf> announce -> notice ?
[13:19:32] <gnarf> notify -> notice
[13:20:19] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[13:22:47] <DaveMethvin> uh oh gnarf, we gave jaubourg api overloads
[13:23:44] <jaubourg> fuckin' belgacom
[13:23:46] <gnarf> jaubourg: notify -> notice ?
[13:23:59] <jaubourg> notify sounds better imo
[13:24:13] <gnarf> throw with notify, receive with notice
[13:24:38] <jaubourg> too close, people will get confused imo
[13:24:59] <DaveMethvin> i have the perfect words, try and catch
[13:25:05] <DaveMethvin> er
[13:25:18] <DaveMethvin> thow and catch
[13:25:30] <DaveMethvin> throw*
