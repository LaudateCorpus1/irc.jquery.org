[03:52:35] <arthurvr> arschmitz: leobalter: jzaefferer: That guy in jquery-release does have little of valid point IMHO (his last comment). I donâ€™t believe he would anyways but we donâ€™t really let people contribute (or at least make it difficult) 
[04:01:05] <jzaefferer> arthurvr: I replied once more...
[04:24:26] <arthurvr> jzaefferer: yeah the discussion is totally going nowhere (I TBH donâ€™t believe he actually would contribute anyways)
[04:24:54] <arthurvr> I was just saying that he may just have a valid point about contributing being difficult
[05:56:42] <scott_gonzalez> arthurvr: To be fair, contributing isn't *easy* even for dev leads.
[05:57:26] <scott_gonzalez> This is the hairiest part of any project I've ever worked on.

[08:33:25] <m_gol> computers. everything breaks something
[09:11:46] <Krinkle> markelog: Thx for the release!
[09:25:50] <markelog> Krinkle: is that issue is no longer reproducible?
[09:26:12] <Krinkle> Projects are updating their dependencies as we speak. It'll gradually increase exposure and we;ll see.
[09:26:28] <Krinkle> markelog: But given that we removed the components from harmony, the bug has to be gone.
[09:27:19] <Krinkle> markelog: It was never reproducible. It just happened a few times a day, causing everyoen to have to re-build or re-submit.
[09:32:50] <markelog> Krinkle: yeah, it annoyed a lot of people ((

[13:49:24] <Krinkle> m_gol: Hm.. isn't a string valid for $.each() though?
[13:49:27] <Krinkle> They're array-like
[13:49:42] <Krinkle> It just happens that JS doesn't support 'in' operator on strings
[13:50:04] <m_gol> Krinkle: $.each is only documented to work on arrays
[13:50:39] <m_gol> http://api.jquery.com/Types/#ArrayLikeObject
[13:50:51] <m_gol> "Either a true JavaScript Array or a JavaScript Object..."
[13:50:54] <Krinkle> Hm.. ok
[13:50:54] <m_gol> string is not an object
[13:52:28] <Krinkle> m_gol: Shoudl we re-close that issue then :) ?
[13:59:53] <m_gol> Krinkle: what issue?
[14:00:21] <Krinkle> The Issue (TM)
[14:00:22] <Krinkle> :P
[14:00:26] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2145
[14:01:10] <Krinkle> Oh it wasn't closed yet in the first place
[14:03:09] <m_gol> Krinkle: I see it hasn't landed on `master`/`compat` yet so it's rightfully not closed
[14:26:46] <Krinkle> Hm.. 
[14:26:56] <Krinkle> but we released it to the world
[14:27:00] <m_gol> in 2.1.4
[14:27:08] <m_gol> and 1.11.3
[14:27:10] <m_gol> separate branches
[14:27:16] <Krinkle> and 1.11x
[14:27:16] <Krinkle> How can it not be in master yet?
[14:27:18] <Krinkle> Isn't it backported from master to there
[14:27:29] <m_gol> master/compat have been about 3.0.0 for a long time
[14:27:36] <m_gol> no, it landed on 2.1-stable & 1.11-stable
[14:27:54] <Krinkle> Is this issue specific to 1./2.x ?
[14:28:03] <m_gol> no
[14:28:15] <m_gol> no idea why timmywil hasn't landed it on master
[14:28:19] <Krinkle> k
[15:01:48] <timmywil> Hey Krinkle, m_gol. Yea, I just haven't gotten to it.
[15:02:28] <timmywil> I'll do it now.

[15:04:16] <timmywil> Krinkle, m_gol done. That was easy.
[15:04:57] <Krinkle> Is there a post I can read somewhere about the compat/master branches and 1.x/2.x?
[15:05:34] <Krinkle> Hm.. branch '1.x-master' is obsolete right?
[15:06:08] <timmywil> http://blog.jquery.com/2014/10/29/jquery-3-0-the-next-generations/
[15:06:29] <timmywil> That clarifies our direction, but it doesn't mention 2.1-stable/1.11-stable.
[15:06:29] <Krinkle> I think I did read that, but let me re-read
[15:06:49] <timmywil> Those are just for internal use in case we needed to release patches on 1.x/2.x.
[15:06:53] <timmywil> they came in handy

[15:06:55] <doesallmagic2> Timmy Willison: Core: add workaround for iOS JIT error in isArrayLike
[15:07:59] <timmywil> yes, 1.x-master is obsolete, but deleting the branch auto-closes any PRs attached to that branch. There's still one left.
[15:08:08] <timmywil> Once that PR is updated, 1.x-master will be delted.
[15:08:12] <timmywil> deleted
[15:09:05] <m_gol> timmywil: we don't need those standards-then-* branches anymore,do we?
[15:09:20] <m_gol> these are mainly jaubourg's PR & my various commits to test it
[15:09:20] <timmywil> Don't think so
