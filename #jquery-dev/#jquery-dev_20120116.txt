[01:56:53] <Krinkle> Hey, I see I've been added to jquery.org/team
[01:56:55] <Krinkle> Awesome!
[16:56:31] <Krinkle> wow code of JQ.Mobi leaves to be wished for
[16:56:35] <Krinkle> if (target == null || typeof (target) === "undefined")
[16:56:44] <Krinkle> a hum, that's wrong in at least 3 ways
[16:56:51] <Krinkle> 4 ways
[16:56:54] <Krinkle> 5
[17:04:24] <tbranyen> Krinkle: if (target == null)
[17:04:29] <tbranyen> eh
[17:50:32] <danheberden> i donno why, but this guy seems familiar of jq.mobi.. like, i remember closing a pull req or something
[17:50:34] <danheberden> but i can't find it
[18:30:17] <SBSTP> is the meeting done, or it hasn't started yet?
[18:32:15] <danheberden> SBSTP there was a meeting about 8.5 hours ago?
[18:32:34] <danheberden> actually 9.5
[18:34:11] <SBSTP> #jquery-meeting
[18:34:15] <SBSTP> is done?
[18:43:28] <ajpiano> yes it is at noon eastern time
[18:46:26] <SBSTP> when is noon
[18:46:42] <ajpiano> 12:00 pm
[18:46:46] <ajpiano> 17:00 gmt
[18:46:52] <ajpiano> where do you live?
[18:47:00] <SBSTP> quebec
[18:47:13] <SBSTP> I guess I misread the announcement
[18:48:32] <ajpiano> SBSTP: c'est a midi
[19:00:19] <SBSTP> oui maintenant je le sais :d
[19:02:03] <ajpiano> mon francais est mort, j'espere que ton anglais est mieux
[19:03:58] <SBSTP> I'm still learning...
[19:04:17] <SBSTP> but I was able to get in 'English: First Language' in my college
[19:08:00] <ajpiano> j'ai appris quand j'etais a l'ecole, mais c'etait il y a 10 ans
[19:08:13] <ajpiano> so hopefully you can keep up, see you next week i suppose :)
[19:08:32] <SBSTP> yeah I'll try to
[19:08:43] <SBSTP> but joining an open source projects is tough
[19:09:08] <SBSTP> you have to get used to the people and the organization
[19:09:32] <ajpiano> have you got a lot of jQuery experience already, or are you relatively new to it as well
[19:09:38] <ajpiano> SBSTP: you are in the right place already :)
[19:09:53] <SBSTP> I always use jQuery
[19:10:00] <SBSTP> im familiar to most of its functions
[19:10:19] <SBSTP> but not used to the inside functionning
[19:10:57] <ajpiano> SBSTP: i have some slides about how you can sort of ramp up gradually
[19:11:01] <ajpiano> http://ajpiano.com/stateofjquery-2011/#slide20
[19:11:10] <ajpiano> if you go there and hit right to go through the next few slides
[19:11:41] <SBSTP> what if I'm a javascript ninja?
[19:11:52] <SBSTP> I know about closures, inheritance and a lot more
[19:12:13] <ajpiano> SBSTP: keep following along
[19:12:59] <ajpiano> the best way to gradually get exposure just to jquery's internals, is by reading through bugs that come in
[19:13:25] <ajpiano> and trying to figure out if things are really bugs or not, etc, etc.
[19:13:43] <ajpiano> and there are a lot of things to do in jquery land that are outisde of the scope of just jquery core
[19:14:22] <ajpiano> SBSTP: http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-jquery-bug-fixing-guide
[19:14:26] <SBSTP> is there a mailing list?
[19:15:04] <SBSTP> eww unix command line
[19:16:17] <SBSTP> just kidding
[19:16:17] <ajpiano> welcome to the future :p
[19:16:22] <ajpiano> hehe
[19:16:31] <SBSTP> *but unity sucks*
[19:16:33] <SBSTP> woups
