[05:55:13] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (20.942s ago): got a bit overzealous with converting to pixel, followup to #12018
[05:55:26] <DaveMethvin> yay
[05:55:28] <mikesherov> But at least I fixed my test fail :-/
[05:55:49] <DaveMethvin> imma try to get rc1 out today but i have a lot of stuff to land
[05:55:56] <DaveMethvin> and testswarm is hosing the ajax tests
[05:56:26] <mikesherov> i finally have wifi on the train again, so if you need another set of eyes, i'll be on around 5pm
[05:56:53] <DaveMethvin> great, thanks
[05:57:13] <DaveMethvin> btw mikesherov for those ie8 fails we needed Krinkle to change the css on the testswarm file, right?
[05:57:41] <DaveMethvin> what value should we ask for?

[07:15:42] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ping
[07:16:06] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[07:16:59] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: so in our docs for attribute selectors(http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/) we say the attribute value may be an unquoted single word or a quoted string
[07:17:06] <timmywil> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/ linkify
[07:17:49] <timmywil> is there a way to change all of the attribute selectors to say unquoted javascript identifier or a quoted string?
[07:17:53] <timmywil> at once
[07:18:11] <DaveMethvin> i know the rules are more complex than that, perhaps we can just link to the standard? (as long as we follow it)
[07:18:53] <timmywil> yea that would be fine with me
[07:19:21] <timmywil> we used to say quotes were mandatory right?
[07:19:52] <DaveMethvin> right, which isn't true
[07:20:04] <DaveMethvin> but it was true, for like 1.5.0 or something
[07:20:28] <timmywil> it's not true, but we could say something like when in doubt, use quotes
[07:20:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah but people NEVER do
[07:21:00] <DaveMethvin> i dunno what is so hard about quoting strange things
[07:21:07] <DaveMethvin> rather than memorizing complex rules
[07:21:37] <DaveMethvin> i figured if we could point to the standard at least we would be covered
[07:21:43] <timmywil> the quoted value can literally be anything under the sun. unquoted values are intentionally restricted
[07:21:50] <DaveMethvin> right
[07:22:08] <timmywil> yea, I'm looking for the syntax
[07:22:20] <timmywil> ah here it is
[07:22:28] <DaveMethvin> i keep meaning to ping kswedberg about how to make docs changes now
[07:22:31] <timmywil> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#attribute-selectors
[07:22:43] <DaveMethvin> it's in github but i don't know if there's an easy way to edit and see the changes formatted
[07:22:53] <timmywil> "Attribute values must be CSS identifiers or strings" (so I was wrong about javascript identifier)
[07:23:41] <DaveMethvin> then you gotta go look up css identifiers :)
[07:23:54] <DaveMethvin> "you are in a maze of twisty definitions, all alike"
[07:24:06] <timmywil> there's a link
[07:24:31] <timmywil> http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html#value-def-identifier
[07:24:51] <timmywil> however, this should be valid according to that http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12141
[07:24:57] <timmywil> so I'll look into it

[08:52:47] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: have you seen this trick? elem.nodeName > "@"
[08:52:57] <timmywil> I'm not sure what that means
[08:53:09] <timmywil> Diego came up with it
[08:53:27] <DaveMethvin> so it's an alphanumeric ... hmmm
[08:53:31] <DaveMethvin> no hadn't seen it
[08:55:14] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: doesn't that mean it only contains letters (not numbers)?
[08:55:37] <DaveMethvin> so that excludes cdata, comment, document, documentFragment, and text nodes timmywil https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Node.nodeName
[08:56:23] <DaveMethvin> everything else should start with a letter i assume? so ascii-wise it's @ then capital A
[08:56:24] <timmywil> oh, because they'll start with "#"?
[08:56:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[08:56:33] <timmywil> clever Diego
[08:56:34] <timmywil> clever
[08:56:37] <DaveMethvin> very!
[08:56:48] <DaveMethvin> cheaper than checking for all those with nodeType
[08:57:53] <timmywil> he makes me feel dumb
[08:57:58] <timmywil> :)
[08:58:09] <DaveMethvin> but we can stand on his shoulders, it makes us much taller!
[09:05:34] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it also excludes processing instructions, whcih start with ? for their nodeNames :)
[09:05:49] <DaveMethvin> even better
[09:06:17] <DaveMethvin> perhaps we could move to that in 1.9, since we already depend on nodeName
[09:06:40] <timmywil> I'm fixing a bug in :empty with this

[12:01:34] <gnarf> pretty sure i wrote a unit for it too
[12:02:08] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: ie9/10 just added some more situations where it fails

[12:26:54] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yeah i was thinking about those for 2.0 maybe
[12:27:03] <DaveMethvin> doesn't everyone have them by then?
[12:27:11] <timmywil> yea, IE9+
[12:27:21] <mikesherov> gnarf: what's up?
[12:27:32] <DaveMethvin> oh boy, mikesherov
[12:27:38] <timmywil> I'll leave them out for now
[12:27:45] <mikesherov> O_o
[12:27:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah, for 1.8 at least
[12:28:04] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to get rc1 out today but it's fighting me
[12:28:09] <gnarf> mikesherov: opera 11.6 effects fail with the "step" test
[12:28:33] <gnarf> mikesherov: also, i manually edited the css on swarm to set that body to 14px
[12:28:36] <gnarf> doesn't seem to make a diff
[12:29:57] <mikesherov> 11.6 is a jerk
[12:30:47] <gnarf> for the ie8 offsets
[12:30:53] <gnarf> i changed that font-size
[12:30:55] <gnarf> still have fails
[12:31:06] <mikesherov> yeah, that's interesting to me
[12:31:33] <mikesherov> because it fixed it for me
[12:31:46] <mikesherov> try taking the font-size declaration off completely
[12:33:06] <gnarf> hrm
[12:33:11] <mikesherov> I know I know
[12:33:12] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: now FF13 gets the same effects fail

[12:33:25] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/379
[12:33:33] <gnarf> mikesherov: just reran that one with no font-size on body
[12:33:42] <gnarf> trying one more time
[12:33:50] <mikesherov> ok
[12:34:03] <gnarf> yup
[12:34:05] <gnarf> still 4 fails
[12:34:12] <mikesherov> less than 10
[12:34:21] <mikesherov> try removing all of the body{} styles
[12:34:22] <DaveMethvin> i think my hacks are still in there
[12:34:35] <mikesherov> oh, yeah, hacks g2g too though
[12:35:13] <DaveMethvin> maybe it's failing because of the hacks?
[12:35:29] <DaveMethvin> oh and today is the day we get some real bug reports http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12148
[12:36:03] <DaveMethvin> i guess toggle() has to call hide() and show() for that to work

[12:44:22] <mikesherov> sorryI got disconnected
[12:44:55] <mikesherov> dave, did you remove your hacks?
[12:44:56] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Wow, that looks exotic
[12:44:57] <b-ot> Krinkle, you have 2 new messages, just say “read” to me when you wish to read them.
[12:45:00] <Krinkle> I didn't know that was inthere
[12:45:08] <Krinkle> (swarmy ? .. : ..)
[12:45:12] <Krinkle> read
[12:45:18] <Krinkle> b-ot: read
[12:45:18] <b-ot> Krinkle, from gnarf, 2d 12h ago: there is something wrong with saving the result html - need some help tracking it down
[12:45:23] <b-ot> Krinkle, from gnarf, 2d 10h ago: I tracked it down - required an ALTER TABLE runresults CHANGE report_html report_html BLOB NOT NULL; -- TEXT fields shouldn't store binary data - its very unreliable
[12:45:53] <DaveMethvin> swarmy was an experiment i did to see if i could make the problems go away
[12:45:56] <Krinkle> ??
[12:45:58] <Krinkle> gnarf: did you actually change anything in the repo or in the db ?
[12:46:05] <gnarf> Krinkle: yes
[12:46:08] <gnarf> i had to alter the db
[12:46:10] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov:  just removed and pushed
[12:46:27] <mikesherov> k
[12:46:29] <mikesherov> cool
[12:46:41] <gnarf> you were storing gzip'ed data in TEXT column, which should have been BLOB because gzip isn't text, its binary
[12:46:46] <DaveMethvin> so it's gonna get worse :P
[12:47:03] <DaveMethvin> i was skipping the tests entirely before, so they couldn't possibly fail
[12:47:11] <DaveMethvin> but i wanted t hose hacks out anyway
[12:49:44] <Krinkle> gnarf: Interesting, the thing is though that I knew that
[12:49:47] <Krinkle> I wonder why I did that
[12:49:53] <Krinkle> hm..
[12:49:54] <mikesherov> 12 fails :-\
[12:49:59] <Krinkle> ah, I didn't introduce that
[12:50:09] <Krinkle> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/v0.2.0/config/testswarm.sql#L46
[12:50:27] <Krinkle> its been in there since John Resig's initial version even.
[12:50:41] <Krinkle> gnarf: wanna put up a pr ?
[12:51:12] <gnarf> Krinkle: i could just push the change
[12:51:16] <Krinkle> gnarf: How did it break though ? I mean, in retrospect I wonder how it didn't fail earlier, but it did appear to work just fine until now
[12:51:21] <mikesherov> BLOB, TEXT… cosmetic
[12:51:30] <gnarf> mikesherov: not in newer mysql apparently
[12:51:38] <mikesherov> which version?
[12:51:39] <gnarf> because that TEXT field didn't store the gzip data
[12:51:54] <mikesherov> wonder what the storage requirements are.
[12:51:56] <gnarf> 5.5.25a
[12:52:06] <Krinkle> gnarf: oh yes, it did. TestSwarm always did gzip the result html into the db
[12:52:23] <mikesherov> :-)
[12:52:45] <mikesherov> how large is the gzipped data?
[12:53:02] <gnarf> not larger than TEXT
[12:53:03] <Krinkle> the qunit test result html
[12:53:14] <Krinkle> a regular html document for running 1 module in a qunit test suite
[12:53:16] <scott_gonzalez> Can anyone get this to work? Trying to upload a file to GitHub. https://gist.github.com/3178195
[12:53:18] <mikesherov> yeah, TEXT BLOB should be same thing than
[12:53:31] <Krinkle> then, yes. but apparently it failed.
[12:53:41] <Krinkle> gnarf: how did you run into this? on the new server ?
[12:53:46] <gnarf> yes
[12:54:03] <gnarf> it wasn't storing the HTML
[12:54:06] <gnarf> i turned on query logging
[12:54:12] <gnarf> and saw that it was actually storing the data
[12:54:21] <gnarf> but the field was empty after the UPDATE statement
[12:54:30] <gnarf> switched it to BLOB and it works
[12:55:11] <gnarf> either way - cosmetically it should be BLOB if its storing binary )
[12:57:10] <gnarf> Krinkle: you mind if I just push this rather than PR it?
[12:57:41] <gnarf> mikesherov: except TEXT trys to put it through the correlation ('utf8')
[12:58:16] <mikesherov> yup
[12:58:23] <mikesherov> that's true
[12:58:47] <mikesherov> also, the collations will force it to try to be sortable

[14:12:02] <DaveMethvin> haha
[14:12:15] <DaveMethvin> I didn't say it was a GOOD idea :P
[14:12:29] <DaveMethvin> it's just a backcompat thing though
[14:15:40] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i dunno - i suppose i could remove the optimizations we did to toggle to reduce size
[14:15:52] <gnarf> and have it call .fn.hide / .fn.show
[14:19:49] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: actually
[14:20:03] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L325-327
[14:21:03] <DaveMethvin> right but that's only if animated,right?
[14:21:26] <gnarf> right

[14:23:18] <mikesherov> why is http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12148 a blocker?
[14:23:19] <bot-t> (50 hours 50 mins ago) <gibson042> tell mikesherov https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/aa3fabce461313f7c31e9a250df57165f15be873 busts the effects test for 11971 by converting background-position-x from % to px
[14:23:20] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by Dave Methvin (2d, 19h ago): Fix #12088, Safari 5 and more percentages in getComputedStyle  In particular, min-width and max-width are taunting the awesome hack. Closes gh-865.
[14:23:59] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/css.js#L119 -> jQuery( this )[ state ? "show" : "hide" ](); ???
[14:24:11] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i wanted to resolve it before we went rc, one way or the other
[14:24:17] <mikesherov> i see
[14:24:27] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ^^^ ?
[14:24:29] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, yeah i don't think it is much harder than that
[14:24:42] <DaveMethvin> but i wondered whether we wanted to support that
[14:25:24] <gnarf> hrm
[14:25:27] <DaveMethvin> basically this guy wants a pseudo-guarantee that we'll go through hide/show rather than messing with display property directly
[14:25:37] <DaveMethvin> which i guess we can do
[14:25:48] <DaveMethvin> but i always get that spidey sense
[14:26:03] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Core build #286: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/286/
[14:26:03] <i-hate-dave> Corey Frang: Oops, didn't mean to revert sizzle last time
[14:26:51] <DaveMethvin> well it seems easy enough to fix, I can do the honors if you want gnarf
[14:27:25] <DaveMethvin> but i'm hesitant to add a unit test ... does that make me a bad person?
[14:27:44] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: It seems silly to change it without adding a unit
[14:28:03] <DaveMethvin> lemme see what the toggle docs say
[14:28:30] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: also - I wonder if it wouldn't be better to expose the new "showHide"
[14:29:10] <DaveMethvin> well the docs seem pretty clear that .toggle() uses show/hide: http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[14:29:10] <gnarf> jQuery.showHide( elements, state )
[14:29:24] <DaveMethvin> so yeah we need both the change and unit test
[14:29:39] <DaveMethvin> i wouldn't expose it for 1.8 gnarf
[14:29:41] <gnarf> i guess we do
[14:30:08] <DaveMethvin> damn you, realistic pseudo-code!!!!
[14:31:05] <DaveMethvin> brb
[14:51:34] <mikesherov> .
[15:08:27] <DaveMethvin> back
[15:08:49] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, i can do the fix for that toggle issue
[15:09:14] <DaveMethvin> oh and a unit test too :)
[15:17:34] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: sure - effects already worked so...
[15:54:41] <mikesherov> gnarf: Did you see my comment?

[18:37:11] <gnarf> also DaveMethvin when duck punching, shouldn't you "un punch" ?
[18:37:17] <gnarf> in a unit?
[18:37:20] <gnarf> oh nvm
[18:37:21] <gnarf> you did
[18:37:30] <gnarf> i just didn't see it the three times i read it
[18:37:31] <gnarf> ...

[18:37:46] <DaveMethvin> it's gonna be 102 here tomorrow

[18:39:56] <DaveMethvin> oh i bet isHidden is elsewhere and i missed it
[18:40:20] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i think it uses isHidden as a .filter( isHidden )
[18:40:29] <gnarf> hence the "el || elem" thing
[18:41:10] <orkel> yeah, just want to tell you guys
[18:41:10] <DaveMethvin> oh the call in this.filter()
[18:41:35] <DaveMethvin> orkel: we can always count on testswarm to let us know we're failing :P
[18:41:47] <orkel> :)
[18:41:48] <DaveMethvin> well, let ME know I'M failing
[18:42:00] <DaveMethvin> let me put that back
[18:42:16] <DaveMethvin> i was fixing a timing issue on one of the anim tests anyway

[18:49:25] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks orkel
[18:50:17] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov had a message for me about that ie8 fail, it's the only consistent fail left

[19:01:46] <gnarf> which comment
[19:01:47] <gnarf> where? :)
[19:03:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah what comment?
[19:03:42] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: the retest logic seems to be working well, i watched it redo an opera test that got fixed http://swarm.jquery.org/job/387
[19:04:01] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: that was probably me manually requesting it :)
[19:04:14] <gnarf> was it effects?
[19:04:21] <DaveMethvin> oh well your manual retesting is going well, stay there all night
[19:04:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:04:53] <DaveMethvin> pull-eeeze Mr IE8
[19:04:56] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: it should retest, but i think we need to fix something in browserstack related to it
[19:05:09] <DaveMethvin> and ie7 seems stuck

[19:05:18] <i-hate-dave> * dave.methvin: Unbreak isHidden args, they're needed by the .filter() call.
[19:05:19] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i really want to see "retest needed" a different color
[19:05:25] <gnarf> than red
[19:05:42] <DaveMethvin> i do like that it waits until the end to bitch though
[19:05:44] <gnarf> and make sure that it doesn't count the job as "complete" in the grunt task either
[19:07:34] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: what was this note from mike?
[19:07:47] <DaveMethvin> i hope it tells us how to fix those 12 ie fails
[19:08:30] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: same here, but I haven't seen it!
[19:08:42] <DaveMethvin> i don't see anything here
[19:08:56] <gnarf> not in email
[19:09:12] <DaveMethvin> i gotta land that ie9/10 checkbox thing, lets hope it works this time but i'll actually test everyting now
[19:09:58] <gnarf> "try removing all of the body{} styles"
[19:10:02] <gnarf> thats the only one i see
[19:10:09] <DaveMethvin> right which you did, right?
[19:10:13] <gnarf> nope
[19:10:15] <DaveMethvin> oh
[19:10:27] <DaveMethvin> remove ALL the things!
[19:10:34] <gnarf> sure, lets try
[19:11:14] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: should be removed now
[19:11:27] <DaveMethvin> can you fire off just the ie8 test?
[19:11:43] <gnarf> yeah
[19:12:24] <DaveMethvin> well, 5
[19:12:31] <DaveMethvin> but we get that variation sometimes
[19:13:13] <gnarf> thats when its the first test
[19:13:38] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[19:13:47] <gnarf> im reverting these changes now
[19:13:54] <gnarf> or actually
[19:13:54] <DaveMethvin> jquery 2.0 can't come fast enough
[19:14:28] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: :)
[19:14:52] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: can we ask the IE team WHY 8 hates us
[19:15:04] <DaveMethvin> we'll have to add ie10 to the swarm very soon
[19:15:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so what do we do about offset?
[19:15:50] <gnarf> this shit is only wrong in the swarm iframe right?
[19:15:59] <gnarf> like we can't reproduce it in iframes on local?
[19:16:07] <DaveMethvin> yep, and nope :D
[19:16:18] <DaveMethvin> we could just skip the whole damn test for ie8
[19:16:58] <DaveMethvin> if you look at that test it is already very strange
[19:17:14] <DaveMethvin> it *expects* different results for oldIE vs the world
[19:17:22] <DaveMethvin> so, like, why bother?
[19:18:58] <gnarf> voodoo is right
[19:19:04] <gnarf> i didn't realize it was serving .min.css
[19:19:45] <gnarf> with 14px is really does fix it
[19:19:47] <DaveMethvin> oh, i didn't either
[19:19:54] <DaveMethvin> AH
[19:20:08] <DaveMethvin> HOLY CRAP!
[19:20:16] <DaveMethvin> wait, i have a commit to start a run gnar
[19:20:22] <DaveMethvin> gnarf*
[19:21:15] <DaveMethvin> oh just  a sec

[19:27:42] <DaveMethvin> screw that gnarf, we won and we're goin home now
[19:28:51] <gnarf> so right now i think the fact that browserstack kills its clients off every 3 minutes
[19:28:58] <gnarf> or like 5 minutes
[19:29:00] <gnarf> sorry
[19:29:06] <gnarf> is whats causing the "timeouts"
[19:29:28] <gnarf> "callbacks that throw exceptions" opera error
[19:29:39] <gnarf> manually re-running :)
[19:29:54] <DaveMethvin> ah
[19:30:15] <gnarf> I wonder if we could build a "retest" into qunit
[19:31:14] <gnarf> animation callbacks progress count is off
[19:31:19] <gnarf> that one i've seen twice now
[19:32:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah, dunno if you saw but i'm trying to tweak some timing on those

[19:36:36] <DaveMethvin> aw yeah
[19:38:15] <DaveMethvin> hmm, effects fail
[19:39:37] <gnarf> RETEST!
[19:39:47] <gnarf> I DEMAND IT!
[19:40:03] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Core build #291: STILL FAILING in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/291/
[19:40:04] <i-hate-dave> dave.methvin: Pull in unit tests from gh-877, thanks @orkel!
[19:42:36] <gnarf> hrm
[19:42:42] <gnarf> i figured out the case of the infinite timeout
[19:42:47] <gnarf> its waiting for a rerunner
[19:43:04] <DaveMethvin> why doesn't it get one?
[19:43:13] <elijahmanor> i ran http://swarm.jquery.org/build/jquery-ui/548d37bca15c998429f35957f2166577023320bf/tests/unit/effects/effects.html?nojshint=true&jquery=git against my local VM of IE9 and it all passed green
[19:43:24] <gnarf> but my integration to browserstack has no way of knowing that its worker is not eligible for the last job it needs.
[19:43:26] <DaveMethvin> thanks elijahmanor
[19:43:37] <DaveMethvin> oh
[19:43:46] <elijahmanor> so yeah something w/ browserstack is fishy i guess
[19:44:01] <gnarf> oooo
[19:44:02] <gnarf> DaveMethvin:
[19:44:05] <gnarf> ie9 event
[19:44:07] <DaveMethvin> the testswarm environment is kind of complex
[19:44:21] <gnarf> jQuery loaded asynchronously fires ready before all sub-resources are loaded
[19:44:26] <elijahmanor> yeah: i'm starting to figure that out
[19:44:35] <DaveMethvin> that one fires sometimes
[19:44:41] <DaveMethvin> fails*
[19:44:53] <DaveMethvin> but randomly
[19:44:59] * gnarf calls for retest
[19:45:11] <DaveMethvin> i actually  haven't seen that one fail for a whil
[19:45:12] <DaveMethvin> e
[19:45:13] <gnarf> im like the swarm judge
[19:45:33] <DaveMethvin> swarm judge judy
[19:45:37] * elijahmanor seconds the call for a retest ;)
[19:46:10] <DaveMethvin> i'm comfortable we have eliminated most of the errors b/c the unit tests run fine locally outside the swarm
[19:46:17] <DaveMethvin> but we need to be able to trust swarm results
[19:46:50] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if we can start to iron out more of the unstable tests, the "retest" strategy will do its job
[19:47:06] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[19:47:10] <DaveMethvin> i think we are close now
[19:47:13] <gnarf> also, I'm not sure if it counts a timeout toward the "retest" limit of 1 or not
[19:47:17] <gnarf> we only retest once
[19:47:32] <DaveMethvin> it's possible that the ie9 one is a real problem since it's a timing kinda thing
[19:47:33] <gnarf> so if a browserstack browser is terminated early, the retest might be eaten up
[19:48:05] <DaveMethvin> but we're in iframeception hell i think for that test in particular
[19:48:10] <mikesherov> :)
[19:48:12] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov!
[19:48:33] <mikesherov> I am about to witness the first passing test
[19:48:36] <mikesherov> !
[19:48:41] <DaveMethvin> http://wnd8.com/grab/56f15b.png
[19:48:54] <DaveMethvin> that was after a few forced reruns
[19:48:59] <mikesherov> Nice
[19:49:11] <mikesherov> So it was the body thing
[19:49:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah we didn't realize it was using the compressed css
[19:49:38] <mikesherov> Now I just need to figure out what is behind that sorcery for my own sanity!
[19:49:45] <DaveMethvin> so gnarf was editing the normal file
[19:49:52] <mikesherov> Silly gnarf
[19:50:27] <DaveMethvin> i was saying that whole set of tests are kind of strange since they don't expect the same results from oldIE and have different numbers
[19:50:56] <mikesherov> Man, that green looks awesome
[19:51:03] <mikesherov> A sight for sore eyes
[19:51:19] <DaveMethvin> TELL IT TO ME SWARMY, I NEED YOU TO SAY IT
[19:56:39] <gnarf> why's it gotta be stalled on effects
[19:56:42] <gnarf> in ie7
[19:56:43] <gnarf> ...
[19:56:57] <DaveMethvin> because effects is big and ie7 is slow
[19:57:22] <DaveMethvin> ya
[19:57:23] <i-hate-dave> Yippie, build fixed!
[19:57:23] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Core build #292: FIXED in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/292/
[19:57:24] <i-hate-dave> * dave.methvin: Fix #12127, fer real. IE9/10 check state on clone. Close gh-875.
[19:57:24] <i-hate-dave> * Corey Frang: Adding a check for double progress call in effects units
[19:57:41] <DaveMethvin> ladies and gentlemen, you will remember where you were this day
[19:57:49] <mikesherov> Hahaha
[19:58:36] <mikesherov> So I was talking to Jorn about this, but... The run page on swarm should have zero CSS
[19:59:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah i am not sure why it needs any
[19:59:07] <mikesherov> It should be a hideously ugly page with an IFRAME
[19:59:17] <DaveMethvin> well hell i can design THAT
[19:59:38] <DaveMethvin> i bet that's i-hate-dave
[19:59:54] <snover> hi dave
[19:59:58] <DaveMethvin> hey snover
[19:59:59] <mikesherov> I mean, CSS shouldn't spill over into an IFRAME. But hell, ie8 begs to differ.
[20:00:09] <snover> WERTS HERPERNERN
[20:00:57] <DaveMethvin> so now that we got this build fixed, i need to break it
[20:01:06] <DaveMethvin> or maybe i should work on the release notes
[20:01:09] <DaveMethvin> naaaaaaah
[20:01:29] <mikesherov> Maybe you should go to bed
[20:02:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah at this point i'm tired and will probably break something
[20:02:53] <mikesherov> Don't worry I got that covered
[20:03:36] <mikesherov> I'm having a company Hackathon next week, so some of the SNAP people will be open source code raiding
[20:03:51] <mikesherov> I'm sure we'll break jquery somehow
[20:04:14] <DaveMethvin> today we got a bunch of decent tickets that need to be investigated
[20:04:28] <DaveMethvin> there is supposedly a memory leak in IE7/8 with the change event
[20:04:34] <mikesherov> Awesome. Just in time for RC1
[20:04:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[20:04:54] <DaveMethvin> if it's not killer i'm okay with going ahead
[20:05:01] <mikesherov> Yeah.
[20:05:05] <DaveMethvin> but we'll have to sort it out tomorrow
[20:05:29] <DaveMethvin> plus i'm not ready for a release, i have to do the release notes and get at least some simple build script working
[20:05:37] <mikesherov> Maybe I'll take a look. Gotta admit though that memory leaks ain't my forte.
[20:05:38] <DaveMethvin> the old one is pretty broken
[20:05:42] <mikesherov> Yeah
[20:05:56] <DaveMethvin> i think you got the css bugs pretty cleaned up
[20:06:09] <DaveMethvin> more than half the open bugs are oldIE ones
[20:06:14] <mikesherov> Yeah
[20:06:20] <DaveMethvin> so we either fix them in 1.9 or wontfix them
[20:06:51] <mikesherov> Plus, I got the W3C to amend CSSOM to my liking, and webkit is fixing some other bugs to support that
[20:07:05] <mikesherov> I feel I got that whole stack under control :)
[20:07:28] <DaveMethvin> bend them to  your will!
[20:08:20] <mikesherov> Hahaha. Trying. Glenn Adams is a good editor. So I'm confident I can effect more change there
[20:08:53] <mikesherov> Anyway, g2g. Awesome work getting the build passing. Good night!
[20:10:04] <DaveMethvin> thank YOU!
