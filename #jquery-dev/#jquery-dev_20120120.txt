[05:10:05] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell danheberden Is this on us or them? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8037
[05:10:06] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[05:29:11] <mikesherov> .
[05:37:48] <gibson042> .
[05:48:44] <mikesherov> Do we have a file naming standard?
[05:49:09] <mikesherov> I'm looking at you: /test/data
[05:50:50] <mikesherov> sample filenames: atom+xml.php, echoData.php, params_html.php, readywaitloader.js
[05:51:21] <mikesherov> camelCasing, underscore_casing, nospacing, plus+spacing
[08:16:09] <timmywil> i got it!
[08:16:20] <timmywil> sry, i just had a eureka moment
[08:16:55] <timmywil> ajpiano: so for docs#10848
[08:16:56] <bot-t> ajpiano, [#10848] Animation toggling loses state tracking in certain atomic edge cases (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10848
[08:17:06] <timmywil> I think I know what is happening
[08:17:33] <timmywil> for slides, multiple properties are being animated individually on the same element, paddingTop/Bottom, marginTop/Bottom, and height
[08:18:15] <timmywil> the state data is removed for each property at the moment each property has completed its own animation
[08:18:42] <timmywil> so when a slide is hiding, height completes first, removes its data, then padding, then margin
[08:19:15] <timmywil> but if one clicks between height and padding (or height and margin), the height data is removed, but the animation for the element has not yet completed
[08:19:34] <timmywil> so a new height state is saved on the next click and the full height is lost
[08:20:01] <timmywil> ok, helps to type that out
[08:20:59] <timmywil> so the answer is probably to remove all state data for all properties at the same time (upon full completion)
[08:32:42] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez i forwarded the request to (mt) re: that blocked ip
[08:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[09:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: CSS3 appearance was dropped?
[11:15:42] <timmywil> nvm, it was something else. i got it tho

[13:49:28] <rwaldron> ouch, jenkins is a dick
[13:56:49] <timmywil> rwaldron: someone has a chrome up that just hangs and doesn't do right
[13:58:34] <rwaldron> no idea
[13:58:37] <rwaldron> not I
[13:58:53] <rwaldron> thats a bummber though
[14:04:02] <danzik17> rwaldron: just curious - u have any automated tools to enforce your idiomatic js style?  figured it might be the kind of thing you'd have
[14:05:09] <rwaldron> The style I use is just an example of my personal taste
[14:05:49] <rwaldron> for those that dont want to learn to type that way, i recommend using https://github.com/einars/js-beautify or similar
[14:07:07] <danzik17> fair enough - just wanted to make sure i wasn't gonna spend a lot of time on something that's already written
[14:32:10] <rwaldron> do it!
[14:32:28] <rwaldron> i think js-beautify is probably pretty easy to modify
[14:32:34] <rwaldron> as a starting point
[15:22:59] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: appearance was dropped so css-ui L3 can ship down the line to CR, etc
[15:23:05] <paul_irish> its punted to css-ui4
[15:23:16] <paul_irish> tantek doesnt think he can standardize it
[16:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: So there's no recommended solution for https://github.com/jquery/standards/issues/19 at this point?
[16:12:14] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #19 on standards, reported by scottgonzalez (7h, 1m ago): Degrade HTML5 Inputs
[16:59:38] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: best bet is to ping tantek on this. he's in #html5 from time to time.
[16:59:54] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[17:00:11] <paul_irish> but from my talks with him he's pretty depressed about getting appearance to a standard state
[17:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> Well, at least with it out of CSS (for now), I'm willing to post on the WHATWG mailing list
[17:00:38] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really care about the full support of appearance.
[17:00:44] <paul_irish> but like Mike said... its likely it feels liek there isnt demand from authors
[17:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> I really just want to say "hey browser, act like you're really dumb and have no idea what this is...treat it like text"
[17:01:09] <paul_irish> cool.. this is actually a www-style issue .. i think
[17:01:19] <paul_irish> certainly a csswg spec, although it has to do with whatwg widgets.
[17:01:21] <paul_irish> confusing.
[17:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I...umm...don't want to be on more lists :-P
[17:01:36] <paul_irish> :)
