[13:23:14] <saptaks> gibson0421: I was wondering 2 things. Firstly should I round off and check only pixel values. Because in computeStyle there is one comparison including percentage. So if I do in a separate generic function, then there will be another line of code to add either px or % I think
[13:23:40] <gibson0421> right, this is only for pixel units
[13:23:44] <saptaks> Secondly, function creation and all won't be too much of a bloat in file size, right?
[13:23:50] <saptaks> gibson0421: ok. awesome
[13:24:36] <gibson0421> shouldn't be, but the way to check is with `grunt`, which ends with compare-file-size (we care about jquery.min.js.gz)
[13:26:25] <saptaks> Yeah. I checked with that. It's +27
[13:27:10] <gibson0421> I think we can work with that. Sometimes subtle changes squeeze out another 5 to 10 as well.
