[08:35:55] <ajpiano> jayar, http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jgfeed and also please don't ever ask random questions that are not related to jquery development specifically here please
[08:38:23] <ben_alman> just found what might be a new bug (?) docs#9496
[08:39:29] <ben_alman> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9496
[08:43:08] <jaubourg> hi there
[08:43:37] <jayar> thanx and srry, ajpiano
[09:00:50] <jaubourg> ?tell getify brb, going to get something to eat
[09:01:01] <jaubourg> damnit
[09:01:20] <jaubourg> if getify gets in there, could someone tell him I'll brb?
[09:09:13] <ryanneufeld> I'll keep an eye out, no promises
[09:13:25] <eddiemonge> anyone know how to fix this git issue: error: SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
[09:13:26] <eddiemonge> error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed while accessing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile.git/info/refs
[09:13:26] <eddiemonge> fatal: HTTP request failed
[09:13:38] <getify> jaubourg: ...
[09:13:42] <jaubourg> hey getify
[09:16:02] <eddiemonge> danheberden: yt?
[09:17:30] <danheberden> eddiemonge sup
[09:17:53] <cmcnulty> ben_alman: take a look at:
[09:17:55] <cmcnulty> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms531076%28VS.85%29.aspx
[09:18:15] <eddiemonge> see my message above?
[09:18:31] <cmcnulty> basically it works if you use classname: \:madeup {
[09:19:25] <cmcnulty> see: http://jsfiddle.net/PSGp6/9/
[09:19:31] <cmcnulty> except that that breaks it in firefox.
[09:20:00] <danheberden> eddiemonge via curl?
[09:21:08] <ben_alman> cmcnulty, yeah but what if i was using an html5 element
[09:21:26] <eddiemonge> danheberden: normal git pull. something changed around may 29
[09:21:48] <ben_alman> it just seems weird that the 1st element is created fine, but when subsequent elements are created via .cloneNode or whatever it fails
[09:22:13] <danheberden> that's odd eddiemonge i've pulled np :/
[09:23:03] <cmcnulty> yeah, definitely weird.
[09:23:23] <eddiemonge> i think it was because i cloned it using gits https instead of the git:// one. then something on mt changed
[09:24:24] <danheberden> i've had issues with other hosting companies and the CA cert
[09:24:36] <danheberden> i had to disabled ssl verification on some curl stuff cuz of it
[09:25:05] <ryanneufeld> getify: jaubourg said he'd brb
[09:25:10] <ryanneufeld> getting sammich
[09:27:01] <jaubourg> I didn't go ;)
[09:32:03] <ryanneufeld> oh :9
[09:32:07] <ryanneufeld> *:(
[10:15:52] <timmywil> booo, drawImage doesn't work in Chromium http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/9HtNy/5/
[10:31:54] <ben_alman> ok i'm so confused http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9498
[10:31:58] <ben_alman> what am i doing wrong?
[10:32:11] <ben_alman> danheberden, set me str8
[10:48:54] <dabear> ben_alman: that bug is invalid.
[10:49:00] <ben_alman> what am i doing wrong
[10:49:08] <ben_alman> i don't get it
[10:49:16] <dabear> ben_alman: the last syntax only works for <foo/> and <foo></foo>
[10:49:32] <dabear> it is supposed to be like that
[10:49:48] <dabear> it's a feature
[10:49:54] <ben_alman> what's the reason?
[10:51:24] <dabear> ben_alman: smaller, faster regex. and it encourages doing everything in the options
[10:51:33] <dabear> instead of the first string
[10:52:19] <ben_alman> why is a regex even needed there?
[10:52:56] <ben_alman> i mean, if the 2nd option is a hash, then just map that stuff onto the newly created element
[10:55:11] <dabear> because document.createElement is much faster than buildFragment?
[10:55:21] <ben_alman> hmmn
[10:55:45] <dabear> ret = rsingleTag.exec( selector );
[10:55:47] <ben_alman> why not only use the fragment if necessary then
[10:55:49] <dabear> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.1.js
[10:55:52] <dabear> search for that
[10:57:05] <ben_alman> if ( jQuery.isPlainObject( context ) ) {
[10:57:10] <ben_alman> is only used if ( ret )
[10:57:15] <ben_alman> but why not use it on both?
[10:57:55] <dabear> building the fragment takes time
[10:58:11] <ben_alman> so? if the user wants to do it, let them know it will be slightly slower
[10:58:15] <ben_alman> or don't and they'll figure it out
[10:58:19] <dabear> it is now necessary to build a fragment if the string contains a single tag
[10:58:36] <ben_alman> but only if that tag has attributes or html
[10:58:37] <dabear> not*
[10:59:04] <ben_alman> well it seems like if you can do $(html) then you should also be able to do $(html, options)
[10:59:08] <dabear> ben_alman: I think JohnResig mentioned why this was chosen in a release note somewhere
[10:59:12] <ben_alman> i don't see a downside
[10:59:14] <ben_alman> hmmn
[10:59:25] <ben_alman> JohnResig, i'm filing a complaint
[10:59:27] <ben_alman> :P
[11:01:07] <dabear> $("<span></span>", {foo: "bar"}) is fast, because it returns $.fn.attr.call([document.createElement("span")], options, true)
[11:01:18] <ben_alman> i understand whay it's fast
[11:01:19] <ben_alman> sure
[11:01:34] <ben_alman> but jquery is "write less, do more" not "only write what's fastest"
[11:02:37] <dabear> if you wanted that behavior, you would have to do returns $.fn.attr.call(buildthefragment(document.createElement("span")), options, true)
[11:02:55] <dabear> if you wanted that behavior, you would have to do returns $.fn.attr.call(buildthefragment(("span"), options, true)
[11:02:56] <dabear> sry
[11:03:30] <dabear> well, im just reading the source. others might know this better
[11:03:34] <ben_alman> np
[11:03:52] <ben_alman> i just don't see why effectively remove functionality
[11:04:01] <ben_alman> but if there's a good reason, then okeedokee
[11:12:23] <ben_alman> dabear, rwaldron fixed the issue :P
[11:12:52] <rwaldron> which?
[11:12:55] <rwaldron> madeup elements?
[11:13:04] <ben_alman> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9498
[11:13:26] <ben_alman> rw ^^ might be needsdocs at this point
[11:13:28] <rwaldron> ohhh you were talking _about_ me
[11:13:32] <rwaldron> not to me
[11:13:33] <ben_alman> er rwaldron that is
[11:13:36] <ben_alman> no ABOUT
[11:13:41] <ben_alman> you're internet-famous man
[11:13:54] <rwaldron> why needs docs?
[11:13:57] <rwaldron> its fixed
[11:14:06] <ben_alman> dabear said it was *not* a bug
[11:14:09] <ben_alman> and intentional
[11:14:13] <ben_alman> and documented as such
[11:14:23] <ben_alman> i said, well it should work that way
[11:14:26] <rwaldron> you'll be able to do retarded shit with no repercussions
[11:14:26] <ben_alman> then we hugged it out
[11:15:02] <rwaldron> i think the bug that prevented it from working correctly needed to be fixed anyway
[11:15:12] <rwaldron> totally weird to assume an obj is a document
[11:15:17] <rwaldron> the way it was before
[11:15:18] <rwaldron> anyway
[11:15:24] <rwaldron> back to figurig out your bug
[11:15:47] <ben_alman> rwaldron, i updated my .logSelector plugin
[11:15:50] <ben_alman> made it easier to use
[11:15:51] <ben_alman> http://jsfiddle.net/cowboy/skGZx/26/
[11:16:04] <ben_alman> really useful if you want to visually see what selectors are selecting
[11:16:40] <ben_alman> https://gist.github.com/640714
[11:16:47] <ben_alman> you forked it before, but it has been updated
[11:17:32] <rwaldron> ben_alman your bug about <IE9 madeup elements is annoying.
[11:17:39] <ben_alman> sorry :/
[11:17:49] <rwaldron> no, i didnt saw you were annoying
[11:17:53] <rwaldron> i said the bug was
[11:18:06] <ben_alman> it seems that only .cloneNode'd elements don't get the magic of the html5 shiv treatment
[11:18:12] <ben_alman> or whatev
[11:18:15] <ben_alman> weird, right?
[11:19:21] <rwaldron> my fault
[11:19:28] <rwaldron> hence... annoying.
[11:20:41] <rwaldron> remy sharp is doing something about css & style sheets in html5shim
[11:20:44] <rwaldron> wtf/
[11:21:20] <rwaldron> maybe unrelated
[11:22:10] <rwaldron> ben_alman http://ejohn.org/blog/html5-shiv/
[11:22:42] <ben_alman> rwaldron, yeah
[11:22:54] <ben_alman> like, in my example i even do a document.createElement
[11:23:03] <ben_alman> just to show that it doesn't make a difference
[11:23:20] <rwaldron> no
[11:23:27] <ben_alman> wat
[11:23:41] <rwaldron> i dont know
[11:23:44] <rwaldron> nevermind
[11:25:19] <jaubourg> so traditional html 5 shiv down the toilet?
[11:25:36] <jaubourg> can I say it sucks? :/
[11:25:40] <jaubourg> and hi guys
[11:25:44] <rwaldron> i think maybe the problem is createDocumentFragment
[11:25:48] <rwaldron> but i might be off my rocker
[11:25:52] <rwaldron> hey jaubourg <3
[11:26:04] <ben_alman> you might need to do fragment.createElement("madeup")
[11:26:10] <ben_alman> jon neal had to do somestuff with this
[11:26:11] <jaubourg> oh, could be
[11:26:15] <ben_alman> it got very complicated iirc
[11:26:37] <rwaldron> ben_alman exactly what I was thinking
[11:26:41] <rwaldron> i'm writing a fail test now
[11:26:48] <rwaldron> from your fiddle
[11:29:35] <ben_alman> rwaldron, http://jsfiddle.net/cowboy/g2WVn/show/
[11:29:38] <ben_alman> that fails in IE
[11:29:39] <ben_alman> check it out
[11:29:53] <rwaldron> dude
[11:29:59] <rwaldron> "show" links are annoying
[11:30:03] <rwaldron> just sayin
[11:30:13] <ben_alman> if you try to run it in IE6 it blows up tho without /show
[11:30:22] <rwaldron> interesting
[11:30:48] <ben_alman> rwaldron, ie6 w/o show http://gyazo.com/20a9a18ea1077d7c885a918b6f38df67.png
[11:31:01] <ben_alman> so...
[11:31:03] <rwaldron> yeah i getcha now
[11:31:04] <ben_alman> but w/e
[11:31:11] <rwaldron> no big deal
[11:31:16] * ben_alman hugz
[11:31:17] <rwaldron> thanks for making clear tests
[11:31:22] <ben_alman> it's what i do
[11:31:25] <rwaldron> and concise
[11:31:29] <ben_alman> thanks for fixing bugs
[11:33:43] <ben_alman> i added my POJ example
[11:34:27] <ben_alman> and i don't get that jsfiddle non-show error in IE7+ so i'll only use /show links if it's ie6 specific
[11:34:30] <ben_alman> :)
[11:45:46] <rwaldron> ben
[11:45:48] <rwaldron> ben_alman
[11:46:05] <ben_alman> hiya
[11:46:18] <rwaldron> http://pastebin.com/chYPnniq
[11:46:41] <rwaldron> i have a class called "madeup" in test/data/testsuite.css
[11:46:51] <rwaldron> so... that's passing in IE6,7,8
[11:46:53] <ben_alman> how do you unit test this to make sure it works?
[11:46:56] <ben_alman> wait
[11:47:07] <rwaldron> am I doing this wrong?
[11:47:17] <ben_alman> don't test based on the class
[11:47:19] <ben_alman> but the element
[11:47:21] <ben_alman> foo { }
[11:47:23] <ben_alman> not .foo { }
[11:47:35] <ben_alman> oof http://www.iecss.com/shimprove/
[11:48:45] <ben_alman> rwaldron, the unminifed script there might suggest a course of action
[11:48:56] <ben_alman> since it overrides cloneNode
[11:48:57] <ben_alman> heh
[11:49:47] <rwaldron> yay
[11:49:50] <rwaldron> test is failing now
[11:49:52] <rwaldron> woooo!
[11:50:55] <ben_alman> another possible helpful link http://jdbartlett.github.com/innershiv/
[11:51:57] <rwaldron> I'm trying a few things first
[11:52:00] <rwaldron> before I look at these
[12:08:17] <jaubourg> sooo... my klingon name generator works
[12:47:13] <rwaldron> ben_alman so, how would you write a support test that requires a non inline style?
[12:47:22] <rwaldron> should i create a style element and then remove it?
[12:47:36] <ben_alman> sure
[12:47:52] <ben_alman> article { width: 10px !important; }
[12:48:03] <rwaldron> ok
[12:48:07] <rwaldron> innerHTML?
[12:48:08] <ben_alman> in a <style> that you remove after
[12:48:10] <ben_alman> no
[12:48:14] <rwaldron> textContent?
[12:48:19] <rwaldron> createTextNode?
[12:48:39] <ben_alman> var elem = $("<style>article { width: 10px !important; }</style>").appendTo("#fixture");
[12:48:45] <ben_alman> do it all in one shot
[12:48:47] <ben_alman> and it will work
[12:48:53] <rwaldron> ugh
[12:48:58] <ben_alman> it gets complex if you need to do it in 2 steps
[12:49:37] <ben_alman> i guess if you append it to the fixture, you won't need a reference to it, as QUnit will remove it after the test
[12:49:52] <rwaldron> so, if you look at support.js .... not much jQuery()
[12:50:10] <ben_alman> well
[12:50:51] <ben_alman> var div = document.createElement("div"); div.innerHTML = "<style>article { width: 10px !important; }</style>"; whatev.appendChild(div);
[12:50:52] <ben_alman> ?
[12:51:06] <rwaldron> cool, i'll try that
[12:51:06] <ben_alman> that's probably be x-browser
[12:51:29] <ben_alman> it's just if you have a reference to a style element, you need to use either .cssText .innerText .innerHTML or something depending on the browser
[12:51:32] <ben_alman> etc
[12:51:51] <ben_alman> but if you set the whole thing as .innerHTML it's probably fine
[13:20:16] <rwaldron> ben_alman this is bullshit
[13:20:42] <rwaldron> I cant even get an element to report its style correct for the initial element being created.
[13:38:22] <rwaldron> ben_alman even adding <script>document.createElement('madeup')</script>
[13:38:35] <rwaldron> to the very top of the qunit test suite html doesnt do shit.
[13:38:43] <ben_alman> in all browsers?
[13:38:46] <ben_alman> just in IE?
[13:38:54] <rwaldron> other browsers dont have this problem
[13:39:12] <rwaldron> that last bit was from john's blog
[13:39:34] <rwaldron> doing this in support yields "auto" for the width
[13:39:49] <rwaldron> .style.width is an empty string
[13:39:58] <rwaldron> .currentStyle.width is auto
[13:40:11] <rwaldron> its so humid in here i can barely think
[13:40:11] <ben_alman> and if you change it from madeup to div it works ok, right?
[13:40:17] <rwaldron> no
[13:40:19] <rwaldron> still auto
[13:40:22] <ben_alman> um
[13:40:29] <ben_alman> wat
[13:40:32] <rwaldron> support tests happen in a make believe world
[13:40:37] <rwaldron> i'm not making it up
[13:40:43] <rwaldron> i tried exactly that
[13:40:51] <ben_alman> maybe these tests don't work in make believe
[13:40:55] <rwaldron> i'm done with this for the day
[13:41:02] <ben_alman> good idea
