[09:39:37] <m_gol> ehh
[09:39:39] <m_gol> http://getbootstrap.com/customize/
[09:39:45] <m_gol> wrong jQuery 1.10.2 map file
[09:39:59] <m_gol> moar 404 to the console, please!
[09:40:06] <m_gol> cc DaveMethvin ^^
[09:40:29] <DaveMethvin> thank you, sourcemap "standard"
[09:41:05] <DaveMethvin> hey i have an idea, let's just create our own sourcmap syntax and let the browser makers catch up with us
[09:41:30] <DaveMethvin> so like //&sourceMap=ROOTNAME.map
[09:41:46] <DaveMethvin> no existing browser will understand or give errors for it
[09:41:52] <snover> eh
[09:42:04] <DaveMethvin> so when they finally adopt our standard it will all work right
[09:42:30] <miketaylr> uh i think i found a bug in jquery
[09:42:31] <miketaylr> [11:40:12.084] Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead. @ http://getbootstrap.com/assets/js/jquery.js:5
[09:42:38] * miketaylr hides
[09:42:43] <snover> it is like blaming mozilla for following the DOM 2 Events standard exactly and requiring the third argument to addEventListener, where others didn‚Äôt, and then firefox was broken when others were not. user error, not browser error, though they eventually made it an optional argument
[09:43:40] <miketaylr> i think it was webkit that allowed that first, opera added it because webkit-optimized‚Ñ¢ sites were breaking
[09:44:05] <DaveMethvin> any process that requires the average end user to carry around multiple files and not rename them, or get deceptive messages on the console, is broken
[09:44:18] <DaveMethvin> that is where sourcemap is right now
[09:44:43] <snover> what‚Äôs deceptive? the map file is not there :)
[09:45:21] <DaveMethvin> the person seeing the message didn't ask for the map :)
[09:46:01] <snover> they did, they enabled ‚Äúuse source maps‚Äù in preferences
[09:46:12] <DaveMethvin> or was it enabled by default?
[09:46:17] <snover> it‚Äôs still enabled!
[09:46:20] <snover> and optional.
[09:46:53] <DaveMethvin> but if they enabled it, that is the opportunity to explain the downsides
[09:46:55] <DaveMethvin> like 404s
[09:47:10] <DaveMethvin> if it's by default, they are puzzled by a 404 they didn't create
[09:47:15] <snover> i just feel like complaining about sourcemap spec generating 404s is apologising for people that are too dumb to actually be web developers but are anyway because it happens to be a relatively accessible vocation
[09:47:31] <snover> but i am in my perpetual bad mood today
[09:47:35] <snover> get off my lawn etc
[09:47:43] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15lihanli opened pull request #1385: Fix #14394: Allow changing style !important in webkit (06master...06bug_14394)  02http://git.io/fCTUfQ
[09:47:49] <DaveMethvin> if the source map option was just off by default it would help most of the problem
[09:47:57] <DaveMethvin> NOOO
[09:48:11] <snover> so it is a chrome dev tools bug and not a spec bug then ? ;)
[09:48:16] <miketaylr> i dont' even see that error fwiw
[09:48:20] <miketaylr> maybe i'm looking in the wrong place
[09:49:39] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr i see it in chrome on getbootstrap.com
[09:49:54] <miketaylr> DaveMethvin: just in the console?
[09:50:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:50:07] <miketaylr> hmm don't see it in canary
[09:50:19] <DaveMethvin> oh good i hope
[09:50:26] <miketaylr> just the usual, "event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead."
[09:50:27] <DaveMethvin> are sourcemaps turned on?
[09:50:51] <miketaylr> dunno, i don't even see an option for thta in settings
[09:51:04] <miketaylr> oh i'm blind
[09:51:09] <miketaylr> "Enable JS source maps"
[09:51:11] <miketaylr> yeah turned on
[09:51:16] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr that sounds more like firefox as far as the warning goes
[09:51:42] <miketaylr> nah, chromesies
[09:52:00] <DaveMethvin> and of course they will get that FOREVER until they upgrade to 1.11/2.1 unless these guys stop warning on that crap
[09:52:04] <miketaylr> i wonder if i could submit a patch to supress those errors if it's coming from jquery
[09:52:05] <m_gol> I posted the example here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap/rIt4kvlC6GI
[09:52:16] <miketaylr> seems not unpossible to do
[09:52:30] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr it shouldn't be in jquery-git now
[09:52:38] <miketaylr> learning how to submit a patch is probably harder
[09:52:39] <DaveMethvin> but that doesn't help older versions
[09:52:46] <miketaylr> DaveMethvin: yeah, so many old jqueries
[09:52:56] <DaveMethvin> oh you mean have  the browser not barf that out
[09:53:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would be nice
[09:53:01] <miketaylr> yeah
[09:53:17] <DaveMethvin> because it does the right thing and feature detects anyway
[09:53:24] <DaveMethvin> so there's no harm at all
[09:53:49] <m_gol> I have an impression the most common jQuery versions on the web I bump into are 1.4.x & 1.7.x
[09:53:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah probably
[09:54:11] <miketaylr> i think i'm still rocking 1.3 on my website
[09:54:27] <miketaylr> oh, i took it off
[09:55:25] <DaveMethvin> we're up to 68% of the top 10,000 sites, if it continues at this pace we'll be on 127% of all sites by 2016
[09:55:48] <miketaylr> not enough growth DaveMethvin
[09:56:00] <miketaylr> you'll get ousted from your position of power if you don't hit 200%
[09:56:24] <miketaylr> two version on *every single site*
[09:56:47] <DaveMethvin> sadly, that's all too common
[09:56:57] <DaveMethvin> i've seen wordpress sites with 3
[09:57:12] <m_gol> actually
[09:57:15] <miketaylr> beauty.
[09:57:15] <m_gol> the issue is different
[09:57:23] <m_gol> they just copied the minified file without the rest: http://getbootstrap.com/assets/js/jquery.js
[09:57:25] <m_gol> hence 404
[09:58:02] <DaveMethvin> shoulda used a cdn :)
[09:59:22] <snover> when browsers start implementing patches to suppress warnings only for specific js libraries, something‚Äôs not right
[09:59:30] <m_gol> https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/10839
[09:59:30] <b-ot> m_gol: Issue #10839 by mzgol (7s ago): 404 on a source map on getbootstrap.com
[09:59:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah, the warning
[09:59:44] <miketaylr> tell me more snover
[09:59:49] <m_gol> maybe we should build versions without source map URLs as well
[09:59:55] <m_gol> if one only wants the minified file
[10:00:12] <DaveMethvin> i think this points out issues with the sourcemap spec
[10:00:14] <DaveMethvin> again
[10:00:24] <miketaylr> my thinking is: authors don't have control over big libs, so the warning isn't helpful to them
[10:00:25] <DaveMethvin> i don't really want lots of different "versions" of the same release
[10:00:30] <m_gol> or we should hardcode the source map URL to code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.map ;)
[10:00:53] <DaveMethvin> lol yeah that actually would make more sense
[10:00:55] <snover> i feel like you should establish a team to investigate creating a committee that can investigate the issue of whether or not this is actually a problem that affects anyone in a real important way
[10:00:55] <m_gol> at least it wouldn't be vulnerable to renaming
[10:01:22] <m_gol> hm, that actually might not be so bad an idea...
[10:01:26] <DaveMethvin> right
[10:01:55] <DaveMethvin> it's like, "use our copy of the map and original source, or make a copy and hack it up as you wish"
[10:03:22] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: I like that idea it essentially 100% fixes the problem
[10:04:28] <m_gol> my own Eureka moment ;)
[10:05:21] <arschmitz> m_gol: http://gifninja.com/animatedgifs/271043/edgeworth-eureka-animated.gif
[10:06:40] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: such a change could belong in release scripts
[10:06:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:06:51] <m_gol> if one compiles jQuery manually, we still need the relative URL
[10:07:03] <DaveMethvin> just went into a meeting
[10:07:40] <gibson042> m_gol +9001
[10:14:45] <m_gol> DaveMethvin gibson042 arschmitz: here you are: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14395
[10:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it was 2 way references.
[10:21:03] <scott_gonzalez> The source map references the source file by name.
[10:21:12] <scott_gonzalez> So we're still going to break a ton of stuff.
[10:23:59] <gibson042> damn, I think you're right
[10:25:14] <gibson042> I so hate the sourcemap spec
[10:25:22] <arschmitz> yeah there is the sourceRoot in the sourcemap
[10:25:31] <arschmitz> that combines with file to construct the path
[10:30:48] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: so we can change that as well to be an absolute path to the CDN, right?
[10:31:15] <scott_gonzalez> Doubtful, but you can try.
[10:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> I assume if it's not circular, it'll complain.
[10:32:04] <m_gol> meh
[10:32:08] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand why the map points to the source.
[10:32:17] <m_gol> me neither
[10:39:14] <DaveMethvin> the sourcemap spec is stupid
[10:39:24] <DaveMethvin> maybe we should just take out the sourcemap until this is resolved
[10:39:46] <DaveMethvin> m_gol and I have suggested several changes, no action
[10:40:16] <DaveMethvin> so rather than having it barf out errors by default, the people who actually WANT sourcemaps can add them to their own copies
[10:40:52] <m_gol> that might be a good idea
[10:41:11] <DaveMethvin> it's almost sure to get some action, that would be the positive thing
[10:41:13] <m_gol> we can even add it to README
[10:41:30] <DaveMethvin> nobody ever reads the README, it's the perfect place!
[10:42:19] <miketaylr> README == military-grade encryption
[10:42:44] <DaveMethvin> Even the NSA doesn't read the README
[10:43:45] <snover> given how long this conversation has been going on and the silliness, i think the solution is probably just to come up with a new file format that combines the minified source code, the map, and the unminified source code all in one file so people can just get it all together at once
