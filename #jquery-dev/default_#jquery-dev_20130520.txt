[07:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I have no idea what's going on with http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13907
[07:16:06] <DaveMethvin> don't sortableItems have data attached to them scott_gonzalez
[07:17:42] <DaveMethvin> that's why i suspected .detach() would fix the problem, and it does
[07:18:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but I'm not sure why .remove() doesn't work.
[07:18:27] <DaveMethvin> if it blasted some state data, that would explain it
[07:18:30] <scott_gonzalez> Even if you refresh the sortable it still fails: http://jsfiddle.net/8Qe8T/9/
[07:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> But why in 2.0 and not in 1.9?
[07:18:55] <DaveMethvin> first thing i wanted to do is establish whether .remove() was valid
[07:19:10] <DaveMethvin> if there is data on those items then it is not
[07:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> So use http://jsfiddle.net/8Qe8T/9/ as the valid test case.
[07:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'll edit my comment to point to that version.
[07:20:12] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13907#comment:3
[07:23:20] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez the items have a sortableItem data entry that is being wiped on .remove(), is that okay? 
[07:23:38] <DaveMethvin> is refresh supposed to put that back?
[07:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> There has to be something different in core.
[07:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> That data should be blown away in 1.9 as well.
[07:24:38] <DaveMethvin> so is the refresh supposed to be required for a case like that?
[07:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure. I would think so, but I'm not too familiar with sortable.
[07:25:20] <scott_gonzalez> In all other widgets, the answer is yes.
[07:25:52] <DaveMethvin> well the refresh case still fails so that's the best one to use for a repro
[07:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> I can just bisect and find the commit.
[07:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> But it'll probably just take us to a massive data rewrite.
[07:27:04] <DaveMethvin> it's in the ticket, yes it's the rewrite
[07:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[07:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> Oh...
[07:29:50] <scott_gonzalez> There's an error in this fiddle.
[07:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to close this ticket. refresh() does work.
[07:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> .remove() creates a new stack?
[07:30:50] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, probably .appendTo().
[07:30:56] <DaveMethvin> yes
[07:31:10] <DaveMethvin> ah
[07:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> CLOSED!
[07:32:03] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[07:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> So, now the question is how the hell did this work with 1.9?
[07:33:32] <DaveMethvin> seems like it should have failed there too
[07:35:00] <scott_gonzalez> yeah

[10:04:48] <m_gol> where did we have documentation about pull requests? gnarf?
[10:05:14] <m_gol> I mean things like 'git pr' etc., I saw this somewhere on jQuery's github repos I think
[10:13:00] <gnarf> contribute?
[10:13:17] <gnarf> i don't think i linked to my aliases tho
[10:13:27] <gnarf> m_gol: what do you want to know
[10:13:38] <gnarf> how to test a pull?
[10:13:43] <gnarf> how to merge?
[10:13:59] <m_gol> gnarf: I just wanted to see if 'git pr' uses upstream or origin in the docs
[10:14:14] <gnarf> it uses origin
[10:14:20] <gnarf> i have a "prr upstream 123"
[10:14:22] <gnarf> also
[10:14:26] <gnarf> gnarf37/.dotfiles
[10:14:48] <gnarf> m_gol: https://github.com/gnarf37/.dotfiles/blob/master/.gitconfig#L25-L27
[10:14:56] <m_gol> oh, so it was just in your repo? weren't there a proposal for including sth like that on contribute.jquery.org?
[10:15:12] <gnarf> i don't remember where either
[10:15:16] <gnarf> but it sounds familiar
[10:15:21] <m_gol> bc I thought that it might be more reasonable to write upstream in the docs
[10:15:22] <gnarf> maybe its a pull against contribute?
[10:15:41] <gnarf> maintainers are different from contributors
[10:15:49] <m_gol> since our recommended procedure for submitting a pull requests puts our repo at upstream
[10:15:51] <gnarf> but we should have some docs to share with new maintainers
[10:16:01] <m_gol> and then this alias fails
[10:16:11] <gnarf> well, now that i maintain, my gnarf37/ is called "gnarf" and origin is jquery/
[10:16:53] <gnarf> and i'll push a branch to jquery/ for a pull request sometimes too because I want people to be able to add to it
[10:16:58] <gnarf> like mikesherov or gibson
[10:17:24] <m_gol> yeah, I see your point
[10:18:18] <m_gol> anyway, if we're planning to document it (I think there was a plan to do that) we should either change the proposed alias to point to upstream or to change the recommendation about renaming the upstream repository from origin to upstream
[10:18:25] <m_gol> just sth to keep in mind
[10:18:41] <m_gol> I couldn't find any related pr on contribute.jquery.org repo
[10:18:57] <gnarf> yeah, not sure it exits
[10:19:09] <gnarf> cc scott_gonzalez ajpiano ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (back to doesallmagic)
[10:19:50] <gnarf> should we try to document maintainer tricks?
[10:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I know there's an issue, and that you said you wanted to handle it :-)
[10:20:49] <ajpiano> wouldn't seem to hurt
[10:21:05] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/33
[10:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> You put it in a branch, not a PR. That's why you couldn't find it :-)
[10:21:45] <gnarf> heh
[10:22:59] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/41
[10:23:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i encourage you to make the edits and push :)
[10:24:19] <gnarf> cc m_gol ^^^
[10:25:33] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:27:45] <m_gol> gnarf scott_gonzalez: I added a comment about my concern in the pr
[11:10:04] <rwaldron> m_gol ping
[11:10:12] <rwaldron> I have some strange things to share with you
[11:11:15] <rwaldron> hm
[11:11:34] <rwaldron> preparing my findings has revealed a potential silver bullet
[11:11:38] <rwaldron> stay tuned.
[11:18:40] <m_gol> rwaldron: :)
[13:06:35] <rwaldron> m_gol http://jsperf.com/jquery-1-x-vs-2-x/7
[13:06:43] <rwaldron> not sure if those FF numbers are a fluke
[13:07:29] <rwaldron> nvm, looks like a fluke
[13:08:23] <rwaldron> in chrome I'm seeing consistent improvement
[13:08:54] <rwaldron> ...until now?
[13:08:57] <rwaldron> ugh
[13:09:00] <rwaldron> nevermind again
[13:12:34] <rwaldron> m_gol something is wonky about these tests
[13:13:08] <rwaldron> if I comment out cleanData()'s entire body and now it does nothing, shouldnt that version of the code do the best?
[13:13:10] <rwaldron> it doesnt
[13:13:14] <rwaldron> it does worse
[13:57:23] <m_gol> rwaldron: this: http://jsperf.com/jquery-1-x-vs-2-x/7 returns script error in the 3rd script
[14:02:38] <rwaldron> hm
[14:02:51] <rwaldron> probably because its linked directly to my dropbox
[14:03:07] <rwaldron> and my dropbox jquery gets built everytime i save
[14:03:19] <rwaldron> so, its getting updated with everything, broken or not
