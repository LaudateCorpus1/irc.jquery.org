[06:03:35] <b-ot> rxaviers: Pull request #1029 by rxaviers (3mon 1w ago): AMD support
[06:13:21] <tj_vantoll> The techniques in that pull request are interesting but I don't think it's a path we want to go down for UI. I worry about injecting <style> or <link> tags during development because they're order dependent.
[06:15:26] <arschmitz> i tend to agree with tj_vantoll we have had source order issues with css in mobile in development vs built files and anything that increases the chances of this i would not be in favor of
[06:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> I think we'll just need to do what Mobile is doing.
[06:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> So far nobody has presented a good way to handle CSS.
[06:18:29] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah i just commented that i agree

[14:30:49] <DaveMethvin> haha timmywil, nearly simultaneous
[14:31:09] <timmywil> hehe, yea, just noticed that. blitz!
[14:32:21] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil should we go ahead and make bower a local devDependency? what was the final score on that?
[14:32:53] <timmywil> idk, if sindresorus says we should, my argument is hurting
[14:33:34] <DaveMethvin> haha yeah i was waiting for someone who knew more about the best way to do it
[14:33:37] <timmywil> apparently bower has already considered being installed as a local dependency and is fine with it
[14:33:48] <DaveMethvin> if they are, i guess we can be too
[14:33:55] <timmywil> agreed
[14:34:01] <DaveMethvin> it just seems like a big chunk to make into a dep
[14:34:05] <DaveMethvin> what next, grep?
[14:34:20] <timmywil> and I bet ben_alman could answer the grunt-cli question
[14:35:10] <DaveMethvin> i guess the key thing is that once something gets to a pretty stable plateau you could make it global, but then again how much of what we use is stable?
[14:35:27] <timmywil> heh, not Node ;)
[14:35:38] <DaveMethvin> or jshint, or grunt, or ... :)
[14:36:22] <timmywil> yea, I'm not as vehemently against installing those dependencies locally anymore, as long as we still promote their global installations in the README
[14:37:24] <timmywil> you know, I don't think anyone has mentioned this, but sizzle, requirejs, and qunit *could* be included with npm instead of bower
[14:38:14] <DaveMethvin> we should choose randomly 
[14:38:26] <DaveMethvin> odd numbered releases do bower, even is npm
[14:39:16] <timmywil> lol
[14:39:19] <timmywil> perfect
[14:39:37] <timmywil> we could try publishing grunt to bower, just to see how it works
[14:40:11] <DaveMethvin> veering dangerously towards Inception
[14:40:24] <timmywil> INSTALL NODE WITH BOWER
[14:40:36] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:40:59] <m_gol> it reminds my of the easiest way to install Ruby 2.0 on OS X 10.8
[14:41:08] <m_gol> 1) use system Ruby 1.8 to download Homebrew
[14:41:19] <m_gol> 2) install Ruby 2.0 via Homebrew
[14:41:19] <m_gol> ;)
[14:41:27] <m_gol> 1) * download -> install
[14:41:30] <timmywil> oh yea, I've done that
[14:42:15] <m_gol> then you can re-install Homebrew via Ruby 2.0 if you're evil enough ]:->
[14:44:06] <DaveMethvin> oh, it looks like i may miss the monday meeting m_gol timmywil, will just be getting off a plane in Las Vegas at noon. I will update the notes though. Can you carry on without me?
[14:44:16] <timmywil> sure
[14:44:21] <DaveMethvin> i will try to make it
[14:44:21] <m_gol> sure
[14:44:38] <m_gol> can you bootstrap the agenda? we'll get it from there
[14:44:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'll do that
