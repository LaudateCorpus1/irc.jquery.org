[09:47:20] <ryanneufeld> woot sauce for internal dns
[09:50:20] <callumacrae> I brought it up before, but didn't get a response, but could we discuss the "wontfix" status of this ticket? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8523
[09:50:55] <callumacrae> I don't understand why pageX and pageY are standardized while offsetX and offsetY are not; I can think of far more uses for offsetX than pageX
[09:52:19] <DaveMethvin> callumacrae: can't you compute them yourself? If we do it we will have to do it *every* time and slow down the 99% for the 1%
[09:52:46] <DaveMethvin> we have no way to know whether the event handler needs them
[09:52:52] <DaveMethvin> can't use getters in oldIE
[09:53:10] <DaveMethvin> so diy
[09:53:54] <callumacrae> I sure could, but it somewhat defeats the point in jQuery, imo
[09:54:46] <DaveMethvin> sorry
[09:57:06] <callumacrae> It is also a lot easier to standardize than pageX: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L480
[09:57:28] <callumacrae> because targetX exists
[10:09:30] <ryanneufeld> callumacrae: if it's something you do often, you can make a plugin or overlay to solve this problem.
[10:10:16] <callumacrae> Its easy enough to work round, I just don't think that it adds enough overhead to *not* warrent adding to the core
[10:12:55] <ryanneufeld> callumacrae: I think the ease of workaround plus the slowdown it would cause to have it in core for all browsers is a good reason to not have it in core.
[10:13:22] <ryanneufeld> I think that's what DaveMethvin was trying to communicate
[10:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> callumacrae: Out of curiousity, why do you want offsetX instead of pageX?
[10:13:43] <DaveMethvin> calling $(event.target).offset() for every mouse event would be really expensive
[10:14:09] <callumacrae> scott_gonzalez: I wrote this article unaware that .offsetX didn't work in FF: http://lynx.io/article/simple-drawing-application-raphaeljs
[10:14:19] <callumacrae> DaveMethvin: No, it doesn't require a call to offset()!
[10:14:31] <DaveMethvin> plus i don't think the w3c has defined offsetX/Y has it?
[10:14:44] <DaveMethvin> so is this about making things standards compliant?
[10:15:02] <DaveMethvin> or just adding something for convenience of the 1% case?
[10:15:13] <callumacrae> if (event.offsetX == null) { event.offsetX = event.layerX }
[10:15:33] <DaveMethvin> then use layerX

[15:02:03] <ryanneufeld> omg I just found out about git add -p
[15:02:04] <ryanneufeld> http://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Olo2SOcksek/TjGDjBwmCNI/AAAAAAAAADM/kGROa9hkmR8/Mind%2BBlown.gif
[15:02:43] <ryanneufeld> or: http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/jessie.gif
[15:05:39] <Eviltwin> git reset -p, git checkout -p, and git stash -p are also pretty damn awesome
[15:05:49] <ryanneufeld> http://i.imgur.com/c4pmB.gif
[15:06:05] <ryanneufeld> we're gonna make the switch soon
[15:06:11] <ryanneufeld> from svn => git
[15:06:23] <ryanneufeld> so i'm trying to grok as much of it as I can
[15:07:07] <Eviltwin> Git is usually overwhelming for most at first
[15:07:23] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:07:29] <Eviltwin> People get confused and fear data loss
[15:07:35] <Eviltwin> End up doing a lot of extra work
[15:07:40] <ryanneufeld> which is harder to have happen with git than with svn
[15:08:06] <Eviltwin> But once you've used git for long enough and really explore all of the commands, you reach git enlightenment
[15:08:13] <Eviltwin> And everything is happy and beautiful
[15:08:31] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, i only discovered svn merge -c the othe rday
[15:08:43] <ryanneufeld> and ony today did I learn that you can use -c and -r together!
