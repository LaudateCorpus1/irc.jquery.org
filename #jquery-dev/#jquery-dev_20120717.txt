[08:33:44] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: do the sizzle unit tests work okay for you in IE7? I'm getting errors for all the invalid tests (the second group) even when i go back a ways in commits.
[08:34:33] <gibson042> I get the same.... it seems like an issue with qunit raises, but I haven't had a chance to dig in yet
[08:34:57] <DaveMethvin> oh good, it's not just me
[08:34:59] <DaveMethvin> http://gyazo.com/5c2b441d548b8e6b3a6eade9e2b4b3e1
[08:35:17] <DaveMethvin> strange tho, i updated qunit a while back and haven't done it since
[08:35:46] <DaveMethvin> i tried the notrycatch so i could debug, but it was still catching
[08:36:51] <gibson042> looking at in now, though, it seems... weird
[08:37:22] <gibson042> I just saw Sizzle return undefined on an invalid selector
[08:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> There was something recently about IE9 and iframes and documents not being ready, right?
[08:49:27] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: in 1.8b1 we had some optimizations we had to back out for b2 because they caused jquery in an iframe to run ready too soon
[08:49:34] <DaveMethvin> in oldie
[08:49:52] <DaveMethvin> i don't think it affected ie9 but maybe?
[08:49:56] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[08:50:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting null for document.activeElement occassionally.
[08:50:40] <scott_gonzalez> I guess this is unrelated though.
[08:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> There's no iframe, and the page is open for a long time before the code runs.
[08:51:02] <DaveMethvin> doesn't sound related
[09:08:01] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: I have no idea what's going on... Sizzle the inner `select` errors, but Sizzle still returns
[09:08:31] <DaveMethvin> whatever it was,it didn't seem to be from recent changes
[09:08:40] <DaveMethvin> i checked out one from about two weeks ago, same problem
[09:08:48] <DaveMethvin> so it is bizarre
[10:36:40] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: What's up with #12096? It seems to be working fine for me.
[10:38:00] <DaveMethvin> oh hey, i misread the test case scott_gonzalez
[10:38:12] <DaveMethvin> funny b/c i thought it was right, then i looked and thought it was wrong
[10:38:22] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[10:38:25] <DaveMethvin> which is why i closed it worksforme, then reopened
[10:38:29] <DaveMethvin> well good
[10:39:49] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i'll bet he means ie or something but he didn't say so
[10:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> Entirely possible.
[10:40:09] <DaveMethvin> i thought about asking for a test case but figured i would build one
[10:40:17] <DaveMethvin> but of course that just wastes time
[10:40:28] <DaveMethvin> cause he'll come back and say "oh i meant ie6"
[10:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you didn't even put the inputs in a form!
[10:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> I changed the fiddle to use a form and 1.7.2 and it still worked (only tested in Chrome).
[10:42:29] <scott_gonzalez> IE is really pissing me off with the document.activeElement crap.
[10:43:10] <scott_gonzalez> In test #20 of jQuery UI menu, all of a sudden activElement is null, which is only supposed to happen if the document hasn't fully loaded yet.
[10:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> But it clearly has, and earlier tests even have activeElement set.
[10:46:11] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: so "load" has fired?
[10:46:27] <DaveMethvin> earlier tests in the same page load?
[10:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, earlier tests in the same page have document.activeElement.
[10:47:04] <scott_gonzalez> I can log when window load occurs and see when it is.
[10:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> Though I just did a: if !document.activeElement wait 500ms and retry and it'll looping forever.
[10:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[10:47:47] <snover> * if focus leaves the document because of keyboard navigation (for example because user focuses the address bar), activeElement is null. It is set to null This doesn't happen if the address bar is focused by a mouse click, which is consistent with the observation that it is set before the blur event and not by the blur event.
[10:47:55] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I clicked on teh page and it continued to run.
[10:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> snover: What is that from?
[10:48:33] <snover> scott_gonzalez: comments at http://my.opera.com/hallvors/blog/2007/05/16/quick-spec-for-ies-document-activeelement
[10:48:52] <DaveMethvin> that's where microsoft keeps its good docs, obviously :P
[10:48:57] <snover> also apparently if you delete <body>
[10:49:01] <snover> it will become null
[10:49:03] <snover> i have no idea how you do that
[10:49:31] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[10:51:10] <scott_gonzalez> So adding document.body.focus() in the beginning of the test makes it pass consistently.
[10:51:14] <scott_gonzalez> That's really odd.
[10:51:27] <scott_gonzalez> It's especially strange that this is inconsistent.
[10:52:34] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm....ok, it's not inconsistent.
[10:52:42] <scott_gonzalez> It fails every other time.
[10:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> But that's because of QUnit reordering failed tests.
[11:55:52] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a way to get .css( "left" ) in pixels for all versions of jQuery?
[11:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> Or a way to get it in % (if you know it's set in %)?

[13:09:49] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Typo and link update - granteagon
[13:09:49] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Merge pull request #220 from granteagon/patch-1 - Timo Tijhof
[14:01:59] <Dak> jzaefferer: I'm trying to use your jenkins-testswarm plugin; when I go to the TestSwarm Integration build option, there is no input field for the Test Suite. Do you know what would cause this?
[14:02:08] <Dak> perhaps I need to define my testsuites elsewhere?
[14:02:38] <Krinkle> Dak: jenkins-testswarm is no longer maintained and obsolete with the latest version of TestSwarm
[14:02:46] <Krinkle> it doesn't work with the latest version of TestSwarm
[14:02:54] <Krinkle> what version of TestSwarm are you using?
[14:03:02] <Dak> An old one. let me look.
[14:03:05] <jzaefferer> there's actually a PR to update it
[14:03:11] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/wiki/Automated-Distributed-Continuous-Integration-for-JavaScript
[14:03:11] <jzaefferer> still, node-testswarm is a much better choice: https://github.com/jzaefferer/node-testswarm
[14:03:26] <Krinkle> Follow this guide to set up Jenkins + TestSwarm through node-testswarm^ : https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/wiki/Automated-Distributed-Continuous-Integration-for-JavaScript
[14:03:46] <Dak> Alright. Thanks guys!
[14:04:08] <Dak> and its version 1.0.0-alpha
[14:10:16] <ben_alman> Testing my IRC themeâ€¦ don't mind me :D
[14:10:17] * ben_alman tests
[14:10:24] <ben_alman> ok, that's all I've got.
[14:12:09] <jzaefferer> punk!
