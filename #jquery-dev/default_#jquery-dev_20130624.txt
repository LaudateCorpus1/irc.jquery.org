[06:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't tested UI with 2.x yet, but we always use hyphenated words in UI, never camel case.
[06:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> And I don't think we ever use data- attributes.
[06:50:25] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: apparently someone set those to be sent to jquery-infrastructure google group, no idea who or why though
[06:51:32] <scott_gonzalez> But why were they added?
[06:51:38] <scott_gonzalez> I don't even see them on the site.
[08:24:30] <ralphholzmann> hey scott_gonzalez
[08:24:37] <ralphholzmann> can you check your dropbox referrals when you get a chance
[08:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> ralphholzmann: I'm up to 18.25 GB
[08:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> ralphholzmann: My last referral was April 2nd.
[08:33:34] <ralphholzmann> sweet
[08:33:37] <ralphholzmann> are you still getting more space?
[08:33:44] <ralphholzmann> or does it say "Completed" next to your last referral
[08:33:57] <ralphholzmann> sounds like you may be maxed
[08:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> My last referral email says "P.S. To get even more space, invite your friends or upgrade your Dropbox!"
[08:34:46] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't say that I've used all my referrals in the email.
[08:35:39] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...
[08:35:46] <ralphholzmann> ah okhttps://www.dropbox.com/account/bonus
[08:35:47] <scott_gonzalez> According to https://www.dropbox.com/help/200/en it sounds like I'm probably maxed out though.
[08:35:48] <ralphholzmann> https://www.dropbox.com/account/bonus
[08:36:04] <ralphholzmann> if you look at your last referral and it says "Completed"
[08:36:10] <ralphholzmann> instead of something like 250MB
[08:36:14] <ralphholzmann> then you're maxed
[08:36:15] <ralphholzmann> http://i.ralph.io/stsqeurn.png
[08:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it says completed.
[08:36:52] <ralphholzmann> sweet, you're maxed
[08:36:53] <scott_gonzalez> Take me out of the rotation.
[08:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks :-)
[08:36:59] <ralphholzmann> fo sho
[08:37:02] <ralphholzmann> enjoy the space
[08:37:10] <ralphholzmann> and dont hate on twitter OSS so much ;)
[08:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> Interestingly, I earned 16.25, not 16.
[08:37:19] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[08:37:28] <scott_gonzalez> If it makes you feel better, we'll be supporting Bower soon.
[08:37:36] <ralphholzmann> woot
[08:38:03] <ralphholzmann> although at this point, the "by twitter" notion on bower is just a novelty
[08:38:03] <scott_gonzalez> I think SlexAxton hypnotized me in Portland.
[08:38:17] <ralphholzmann> he's definitely capable of that
[09:07:16] <m_gol> hey, what about the core meeting?
