[05:31:33] <drecute> hello. Please I need some help with this: http://jsfiddle.net/pbv9b/17/
[05:31:49] <drecute> how can I make the slide auto slide
[10:54:14] <gnarf>  has JohnResig shared the 1.7 roadmap spreadsheet yet?
[11:06:39] <gnarf> jaubourg: sup
[11:06:46] <gnarf> nice mail :)
[11:06:51] <jaubourg> oh thanks
[11:06:57] <gnarf> you should like blog that
[11:07:12] <jaubourg> that's what I was thinking too while writing it
[14:07:01] <jaubourg> too many things to review in this 1.7 spreadsheet :/
[14:46:35] <gnarf> vote yes on row 86
[14:46:37] <gnarf> and 85
[14:46:40] <gnarf> +++ :)
[14:47:43] <gnarf> or 84-86
[14:47:44] <gnarf> :)
[14:47:52] <gnarf> why didn't "gnarf" show up for owner on 86?
[14:48:49] <gnarf> i kinda like 87
[14:48:56] <gnarf> modular jquery builds?
[14:48:59] <gnarf> sounds interesting
[14:50:21] <gnarf> now i can play with the gdata api and displaying this spreadsheet in a better format ;)
[14:59:09] <gnarf> so like rwaldron_ totally commented on almost everything in the 1.7 roadmap except my request ;)
[16:28:33] <jaubourg> rwaldron_: saw my latest proposal?
[17:33:34] <gnarf> kswedberg: yt?

[17:50:27] <gnarf> k
[17:50:33] <gnarf> just posted that roadmap proposal
[17:52:35] <gnarf> kswedberg: there was one issue btw
[17:52:50] <gnarf> kswedberg: i couldn't use an "=" in the meta for the attribute != selector
[18:22:23] <gnarf> jaubourg: we need better "Upgrading from x.x.x -> x.x.x" posts i think
[18:24:31] <gnarf> (re your comment in the spreadsheet of doom row 44)
[18:25:30] <gnarf> wow
[18:25:34] <gnarf> this just got worse
[18:25:44] <gnarf> i can't click on the links in these things
[18:25:54] <gnarf> nor can i highlight (because i can't edit)
[18:26:25] <jaubourg> :/
[18:26:29] <jaubourg> heh
[18:28:46] <gnarf> i'm so writing an interface to this
[18:28:56] <gnarf> if i ever find the time
[18:29:01] <gnarf> :/
[18:30:13] <gnarf> can you add me as owner on 35 / 86 / 90 ?
[18:30:36] <gnarf> :))
[18:31:03] <jaubourg> let me check
[18:34:56] <jaubourg> done
[18:36:12] <jaubourg> gnarf: I'm wondering if this Ilia will ever reply to my email
[18:36:21] <gnarf> Ilia?
[18:36:32] <jaubourg> the Deferred email
[18:36:47] <gnarf> ahh
[18:43:12] <gnarf> damn
[18:43:33] <gnarf> i kinda wanna append to my proposal #90
[18:46:27] <gnarf> jaubourg++ for #89
[18:46:30] <gnarf> ++
[18:47:22] <StevenBlack> Link to the 1.7 spreadsheet?
[18:50:55] <gnarf> "If they are actually useful for some other reason, we should put more about their uses on the docs page.
[19:02:33] <ajpiano> StevenBlack: https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AuWerG7Xqt-8dG0yTEs2ZTFWQUhDRUp5dzRyc3NwV2c&hl=en&authkey=CPmgicsO#gid=0
[19:04:12] <StevenBlack> ajpiano: thanks!
[19:12:18] <StevenBlack> The very best way I know to fragment a community, and create a long-tail of legacy users spread across the version-spectrum, gun-shy to upgrade, is the verb "deprecate".
[19:13:12] <StevenBlack> This has a cost that, on balance, isn't widely appreciated, and is too easily ignored.
[19:13:14] <ben_alman> defecate
[19:14:18] <StevenBlack> duplicate
[19:15:30] <rwaldron> ajpiano yt?
[19:15:38] <ajpiano> i am, about to not be
[19:15:49] <ben_alman> that's philosophical
[19:17:00] <rwaldron> can you vertical align your comments :(
[19:17:07] <rwaldron> vertical- align top*
[19:17:30] <rwaldron> jaubourg yt?
[19:18:12] <ajpiano> rwaldron how ?
[19:18:12] <ajpiano> :/
[19:18:22] <jaubourg> hey rick
[19:18:55] <jaubourg> hey Adam too :P
[19:20:54] * jaubourg spanks rwaldron
[19:21:10] <jaubourg> so you ask if I'm here and you ignore me after? :P
[19:21:37] <rwaldron> sorry
[19:21:42] <rwaldron> was tweeting something for ben
[19:21:55] <rwaldron> adam, i can just do it when you're done
[19:21:58] <jaubourg> hehehe
[19:22:10] <ajpiano> ah, got it
[19:22:15] <ajpiano> i'm done for now, mate's here to video gamez
[19:22:31] <rwaldron> jaubourg I've updated a few of my 1.7 comments after seeing your feedback
[19:22:39] <rwaldron> somethings ajax related i wasnt aware of
[19:23:17] <jaubourg> oh?
[19:23:34] <rwaldron> yeah, namely the prefilter no cache thing
[19:23:43] <rwaldron> i didnt know it could be done with a prefilter
[19:23:49] <rwaldron> and i had previously +1'e
[19:23:51] <rwaldron> ed
[19:23:55] <jaubourg> yeah, this is only for Oracle when you use the database directly
[19:24:06] <jaubourg> I mean come on
[19:24:07] <rwaldron> but retracted that in favor of back your "use a damn prefilter"
[19:24:51] <jaubourg> I wish I had more time to work on ajaxHooks and Callbacks and... oh well
[19:25:35] <rwaldron> jesus effing...
[19:25:44] <rwaldron> so, "hooks"
[19:25:52] <jaubourg> heh
[19:25:53] <rwaldron> did you see _my_ proposal?
[19:26:06] <jaubourg> yes
[19:26:13] <rwaldron> i think i wrote the best two proposal's i've ever written on the end there
[19:26:20] <rwaldron> 1. tell people why their ideas suck
[19:26:32] <rwaldron> 2. stop calling shit "thingyHooks"
[19:26:37] <rwaldron> >:|
[19:26:56] <jaubourg> I'm definitely more interested in dying out the hooks code
[19:27:01] <rwaldron> whoever came up with that in the first place should be slapped in the balls once... really hard.
[19:27:02] <jaubourg> drying out
[19:27:13] <rwaldron> yeah dude
[19:28:13] <jaubourg> well, if we put them under a common hooks, I feel like we'll need xxxHooks aliases :/
[19:29:08] <rwaldron> well, we will now
[19:29:12] <rwaldron> becaue made them
[19:29:17] <rwaldron> because*
[19:29:23] <rwaldron> and now have to suffer
[19:29:29] <rwaldron> jQuery.browser style
[19:30:49] <jaubourg> ajpiano: regarding not using a spreadsheet: create a forum, give reply access to "rating" people, have the form create a new post in said forum with a poll (yeah, meh, nay)
[19:31:13] <ajpiano> i prefer this spreadsheet 10000000x more than answering 90 forum polls
[19:31:22] <jaubourg> really?
[19:31:25] <ajpiano> yes
[19:31:26] <rwaldron> ajpiano i thought you'd be my biggest supporter for #88
[19:31:33] <rwaldron> seeing orange was weird....
[19:31:38] <ajpiano> the spreadsheet just needs frozen columns
[19:31:43] <jaubourg> I always feel like we need discussions regarding these proposals
[19:31:51] <rwaldron> jaubourg we do
[19:31:54] <rwaldron> in a meeting
[19:31:56] <ajpiano> rwaldron_ well did you read my actual feedback
[19:32:02] <jaubourg> weekly meeting won't cut it
[19:32:03] <rwaldron> i think this time though... it should be like the bugs sprint
[19:32:14] <jaubourg> and we ended up creating forum posts for 1.6 anyway
[19:32:16] <rwaldron> skype call at bocoup + world
[19:32:35] <jaubourg> maybe
[19:32:45] <jaubourg> (I love those meetings, mind you)
[19:32:45] <rwaldron> dude, that was SO productive
[19:32:49] <rwaldron> i do too
[19:33:05] <rwaldron> i feel like we did amazingly efficient work during that sprint
[19:33:15] <jaubourg> I feel like new features need more offline, thoughtful discussions where people have time to think
[19:33:34] <jaubourg> feature sprint doesn't compute in my brain
[19:33:44] <jaubourg> if you see what I mean
[19:35:40] <rwaldron> hrm
[19:35:44] <rwaldron> we can have more then one
[19:35:49] <rwaldron> and i mean and all day event
[19:36:36] <jaubourg> yeah, it's nearing 5am here :P
[19:36:44] <jaubourg> you and your damn american days :P
[19:36:56] <ben_alman> rwaldron, did anyone ever make that api endpoint that listed all versions of jquery via jsonp?
[19:39:40] <rwaldron> so, no
[19:39:42] <rwaldron> whoops
[19:39:45] <ben_alman> bummer
[19:39:46] <rwaldron> -so
[19:40:06] <ben_alman> well i can fake something for now, hard-coded
[19:40:12] <rwaldron> wait
[19:40:13] <rwaldron> DUDE
[19:40:19] <rwaldron> i saw something the other day
[19:40:21] <rwaldron> one sec
[19:40:25] <ben_alman> k
[19:40:41] <ben_alman> i just want a list of released jquery versions on the google cdn
[19:40:44] <ben_alman> basically
[19:41:35] <rwaldron> ben_alman http://www.google.com/uds/api?file=uds.js&v=0.1
[19:41:39] <rwaldron> scroll to the bottm
[19:41:43] <rwaldron> you could mine that
[19:41:57] <rwaldron> :D
[19:42:00] <ben_alman> it needs to be jsonp for this javascript
[19:42:04] <ben_alman> but that's cool
[19:42:24] <ben_alman> maybe yql or something, but i don't want to rely on them
[19:42:29] <ben_alman> thx
[19:42:40] <rwaldron> i could mine this and add it as an option to jqversion
[19:43:18] <rwaldron> like...http://jqversion.com/?releases=true&callback=...
[19:43:37] <ben_alman> well it's not releases exacly but google cdn releases
[19:43:48] <ben_alman> eddiemonge worked up a doc based on some feedback i had for him
[19:43:52] <ben_alman> maybe a month ago?
[19:43:53] <ben_alman> dunno
[19:44:25] <kswedberg> gnarf — sorry, will have to look at dealing with that reusable issue tomorrow. wiped out now; need sleep
[20:12:45] <jaubourg>  ok time to sleep in belgium
[20:12:53] <jaubourg> good night everyone
