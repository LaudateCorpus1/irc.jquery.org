[13:42:07] <timmywil> wycats: ping
[13:49:34] <rwaldron> timmywil hey dude...
[13:49:41] <rwaldron> I completely agree
[13:49:46] <rwaldron> and um... just a messanger
[13:49:50] <rwaldron> :|
[13:50:02] <timmywil> rwaldron: no worries, my tests started failing and I didn't know why :P
[13:50:29] <rwaldron> yeah, that's annoying
[15:52:41] <wycats> timmywil: hey
[15:52:51] <wycats> timmywil: sizzle is only partially "can run on its own"
[15:53:08] <wycats> the Sizzle tests all (stupidly, I think) test against the jQuery aliases
[15:53:32] <timmywil> actually the don't
[15:53:40] <wycats> lies
[15:54:01] <timmywil> I run them. your change is the only fail dude
[15:57:11] <wycats> timmywil: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/test/unit/selector.js#L7
[15:57:17] <wycats> the tests themselves use jQuery
[15:57:19] <wycats> confirm/deny

[16:04:05] <ajpiano> [18:57:11] <wycats> timmywil: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/test/unit/selector.js#L7
[16:04:06] <ajpiano> [18:57:17] <wycats> the tests themselves use jQuery

[16:04:13] <ajpiano> "While You Were Out"
[16:06:56] <timmywil> wycats: It is still independent. Yes, there are plenty of jQuery references, but they will still work without running from jQuery's test suite.
[16:07:11] <timmywil> ajpiano: thx
[16:07:29] <timmywil> but I agree that should be changed
[16:07:36] <timmywil> and I already do that in 1.8
[16:39:53] <wycats> timmywil: those tests should be using Sizzle references
[16:39:56] <wycats> not jQuery
[16:40:01] <wycats> there is no reason to use the jQuery aliases
[16:40:45] <timmywil> wycats: I already said I agree, but that's not the issue right now.
[16:41:15] <wycats> timmywil: confirm
[16:41:23] <wycats> timmywil: sorry :)
[16:41:35] <wycats> I just didn't know exactly where the line was
[16:41:54] <wycats> I ran all the tests inside jQuery and they passed
[16:42:08] <wycats> sorry bro
[16:42:21] <timmywil> no worries :) I gotta run tho. bbl!
