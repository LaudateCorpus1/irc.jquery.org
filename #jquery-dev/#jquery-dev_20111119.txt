[12:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: can you explain how 10729 affects UI?
[12:48:11] <scott_gonzalez> and what you tried to change in _trigger that caused lots of failures?

[22:41:24] <gavin_huang> the first arg of a success ajax callback is undefined if it's a 304 response, whereas jqXHR.responseText always contains the data. Is it a conscious choice? Does it mean jqXHR.responseText is the prefered way of accessing returned data?
[22:43:47] <tbranyen> gavin_huang: wait really?
[22:43:56] <tbranyen> i've done conditional caching a shit load and never encountered that issue before
[22:44:02] <tbranyen> but this was prior to 1.6
[22:44:21] <tbranyen> lemme try with my lib
[22:44:29] <tbranyen> gavin_huang: what version of jquery?
[22:44:39] <gavin_huang> tbranyen, i'm using 1.7
[22:46:01] <gavin_huang> i found a similar discussion on SO, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5215181/proper-way-to-handle-304-not-modified-in-jquery-ajax
[22:46:25] <tbranyen> yeah i have a sweet plugin that allows me to simulate a server in jQ
[22:46:29] <tbranyen> so i'm gonna set up a test case
[22:46:33] <gavin_huang> seems v1.5 already works like this.
[22:47:21] <gavin_huang> what plugin? I used sinon's fake server.
[22:48:27] <gavin_huang> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L536
[22:48:54] <gavin_huang> you can actually see in the source code. if status is 304, success data is never set
[23:02:45] <tbranyen> gavin_huang: vertebrae, but right now it doesn't work without Backbone
[23:02:47] <tbranyen> i need to fix that
[23:02:54] <tbranyen> it uses the regex pattern matching from it
[23:03:01] <tbranyen> https://github.com/tbranyen/vertebrae
[23:15:58] <gavin_huang> tbranyen, cool, looks promising. routes is interesting.
[23:17:06] <tbranyen> hmmm, seems to work okay for me
[23:17:11] <tbranyen> i got it to work without the backbone lib
[23:17:15] <tbranyen> i need to commit this change
[23:17:17] <tbranyen> but...
[23:17:23] <tbranyen> seems to work okay with 304s
[23:17:26] <tbranyen> in 1.7
[23:19:36] <tbranyen> http://dev.aboutnerd.com/jq-test/ << open up the console
[23:49:02] <gavin_huang> tbranyen, does vertebrae overwrite global xhr? I can reproduce it with sinonjs. http://jsfiddle.net/hDYtV/
[23:50:27] <tbranyen> gavin_huang: vertebrae uses the lowest level jquery ajax hook
[23:50:31] <tbranyen> ajaxTransport
[23:52:07] <gavin_huang> tbranyen, i think i should test with a real 304 response. otherwise i just can't be sure.
[23:52:42] <tbranyen> gavin_huang: i'd trust ajaxTransport over sinon any day
[23:52:51] <tbranyen> ajaxTransport is identical to what jQuery uses with xhr
[23:52:55] <tbranyen> it doesn't get any more real than that
[23:53:13] <tbranyen> under the hood xhr responds to ajaxTransport, so whether its real or not is irrelevant
