[06:33:41] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: look into --squash, --amend, and cherry-pick, it makes the commit  history a lot prettier
[06:33:47] <rwaldron> ok
[06:33:48] <rwaldron> will do
[06:33:52] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov is playing with pulley as well
[06:33:58] <DaveMethvin> which makes it somewhat easier
[06:34:03] <DaveMethvin> although i still prefer the manual process
[06:34:04] <rwaldron> I actually just hit the merge button on github
[06:34:10] <rwaldron> since it was low impact
[06:34:11] <sindresorhus> rwaldron: Or use Pulley ;)

[06:34:20] <rwaldron> I should get that set up
[06:34:25] <rwaldron> i have the oldest version

[06:35:52] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin good news, making that test async passes it
[06:36:26] <rwaldron> 11500 from above
[06:36:34] <DaveMethvin> hmmm ... why? lemme look at it again
[06:36:52] <rwaldron> not sure
[06:37:03] <rwaldron> Krinkle suggested, so it was the first thing I tried
[06:37:55] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: i'm guessing it needs time to inject the markup, but it shouldn't
[06:38:06] <DaveMethvin> oh well, sounds like a job for miketaylr
[06:38:33] <DaveMethvin> in the meantime, async it is
[06:38:39] <rwaldron> for the sake of our tests, making an event handler async is not a big deal
[06:38:43] <rwaldron> events are async
[06:38:46] <rwaldron> ;)
[06:39:03] <DaveMethvin> so are you back in boston now rwaldron?

[06:39:49] <rwaldron> nice!
[06:41:22] <rwaldron> almost done retesting the IEs
[06:41:49] <rwaldron> sindresorhus what do I have to do to set up pulley
[06:42:10] <sindresorhus> rwaldron: npm install -g pulley ;)
[06:42:28] <sindresorhus> Though the version on NPM is old, we're pushing out a new release this week
[06:42:52] <rwaldron> um ok
[06:43:03] <rwaldron> how does it know that I want to "pulley" jquery stuff?
[06:43:17] <rwaldron> (i havent used it in some time)
[06:44:06] <sindresorhus> just open up the folder in Terminal, make sure you're on master, and: pulley 123
[06:44:28] <DaveMethvin> 1.8pre in our case
[06:44:29] <rwaldron> where 123 is the branch?
[06:44:37] <rwaldron> hm.
[06:44:42] <sindresorhus> no pull id
[06:44:46] <sindresorhus> check the docs :p

[07:32:19] <danheberden> fly safe rwaldron - i hope they let you fly the plane
[07:52:43] <ralphholzmann> aww just missed rwaldron
[08:41:53] <danheberden> nacin rworth gnarf wassssup
[08:42:14] <gnarf> not much - just got to rworth's place
[08:42:27] <gnarf> much better internets than that hotel :)
[08:42:48] <danheberden> haha i'd hope so
[08:43:07] <danheberden> though if not, that would explain why the skype calls are so shitty when he initiates them
[08:43:13] <gnarf> danheberden: you home already? or at an airport? :)
[08:44:11] <danheberden> gnarf between chicago and pdx
[08:44:23] <gnarf> wifi on the plane again?
[08:44:26] <danheberden> got another 3.5 hours to go
[08:44:33] <gnarf> luck
[08:45:47] <gnarf> nacin: not sure how much rworth and I will be around before we head out to lunch real quick, but if you want to work on getting a little further on the multi-site for jq01.stage you should have everything you need.
[08:47:47] <danheberden> gnarf - on both planes! and i didn't have to pay agiain :)
[08:48:06] <gnarf> danheberden: do sexy people just end up with wifi on planes or something? ;)
[08:48:31] <danheberden> gnarf - i think it's a thing
[09:00:53] <DaveMethvin> one moment while i open the channel
[09:13:34] <rworth> danheberden oh it's a thing
[09:16:24] <nacin> gnarf: rworth: was at lunch myself.
[09:17:43] <gnarf> nacin: coo - i suppose right now we should make sure its up and running "multi site" - I think danheberden might be able to give you a list of the sites
[09:18:39] <nacin> gnarf: I was thinking about domain mapping and how it can be tested. thinking we can map various domains in a local hosts file to the IP of jq01.stage, then have that server be configured to serve all of the domains?
[09:19:06] <nacin> Should be easy then to finalize the configuration.
[09:19:26] <gnarf> nacin: yeah - that should work
[09:19:47] <gnarf> nacin: also, how is domain mapping configed? is it through the wp-admin?
[09:20:01] <nacin> it can be, but I am thinking we should just hardcode it into wp-config.
[09:20:19] <danheberden> +1
[09:20:35] <nacin> then there is no need for the plugin.
[09:20:53] <nacin> danheberden: can I get a list of domains?
[09:20:56] <gnarf> nacin: hrm... is there a way to do like a wp-config.d directory?
[09:21:11] <danheberden> nacin should be in the repo
[09:21:12] <danheberden> in the wiki
[09:21:17] <nacin> danheberden: great
[09:21:19] <nacin> gnarf: it would just be one wp-config.php file for the whole setup
[09:21:34] <danheberden> though i should update it now that we are killing off the old blogs
[09:21:42] <gnarf> nacin: yeah - im just thinking puppet wise, the list of domains its handling would make sense for me to have one file per domain...
[09:22:16] <nacin> gnarf: ah, yeah. since everything gets routed to the same endpoint, it'll just be one file that maintains all of them.
[09:22:35] <gnarf> nacin: thats cool, i have dirty tricks to get around that too
[09:22:46] <gnarf> i might just have wp-config.php include wp-domains.php or something
[09:22:57] <nacin> yeah, I am going to place things into separate files
[09:23:06] <gnarf> and have wp-domains be concated from the active domains directory
[09:24:04] <nacin> quite a bit of domains in this wiki.
[09:25:27] <nacin> not sure what is WP and what isn't
[09:25:46] <nacin> I imagine https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/tree/master/themes may be a good starting list?
[09:25:59] <danheberden> gnarf i can't believe you just suggested that
[09:25:59] <danheberden> like OMG
[09:25:59] * danheberden is kidding
[09:26:25] <gnarf> nacin: yeah, that plus "stage._________" for each of them
[09:26:35] <gnarf> perhaps danheberden might be able to give you real DNS for those even
[09:27:12] <nacin> would stage.* be the same server?
[09:35:57] <danheberden> gnarf Y U MAKE WORK 4 ME
[09:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> nacin, koopersmith: Do one of you have time to work through the new plan for node-wordpress later this week?
[09:53:55] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yep
[10:15:39] <koopersmith> scott_gonzalez: absolutely.
[10:41:42] <nacin> gnarf: danheberden: Still need to automate it all into an install script for easy deployment and local dev, but I've got the network, the sites, and the themes all set up.
[10:45:23] <danheberden> nacin hot, dude
[11:04:04] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: you and I and richard and nacin and whoever else might have to get together to hash out how the new api.jquery.com repo gets deployed into WP — because of the notes and categories stuff.
[11:05:13] <nacin> kswedberg: there is an existing script that parses the XML, yeah? where does it live?
[11:06:42] <kswedberg> nacin: the current theme has that in single.php and api.xml.php: https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-api/tree/master/htdocs/wp-content/themes/jquery.0002
[11:07:04] <kswedberg> beware: it's hacky! :D
[11:08:11] <kswedberg> nacin: also, node-wordpress will need to look for <category> nodes to make sure the entries are categorized correctly.
[11:08:33] <nacin> so the plan is for the node script to handle this as well
[11:09:10] <kswedberg> I guess so?
[11:10:19] <kswedberg> nacin: check out https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com . has 3 directories: 1 for entries, 1 for categories, 1 for notes.
[11:10:24] <nacin> okay. this will not be too much of a challenge. the XML has changed a bit for the notes, right?
[11:10:50] <nacin> getting a 404 on api.jquery.com - private?
[11:10:51] <kswedberg> yes, it has.
[11:11:09] <kswedberg> oh. yeah. danheberden: get this boy some privs on api.jquery.com repo! ;)
[11:11:31] <danheberden> kswedberg NOU
[11:11:35] <danheberden> :p
[11:11:45] <kswedberg> hahaha. I'm not an admin, right?
[11:12:13] <kswedberg> actually, is there any reason it has to stay private? I think we can just make it public now, no?
[11:13:14] <danheberden> yeah, wasn't sure why it was created as private
[11:13:32] <kswedberg> publicify it!
[11:16:21] <danheberden> added and publicified
[11:16:34] <kswedberg> yay! thx, danheberden!
[11:17:03] <kswedberg> nacin: try https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com again please.
[11:17:17] <nacin> works, thanks kswedberg, danheberden.
[11:19:07] <nacin> kswedberg: as a matter of workflow, it would make sense if a process takes the XML files and imports them into the post content. A plugin would then convert the XML to HTML en route to the theme, which would simply call the_content().
[11:19:13] <nacin> Not a whole lot different from how it is now.
[11:20:31] <kswedberg> that makes sense. so the db is still storing the xml, not the html, right?
[11:21:05] <nacin> yes. though I would probably store the generated HTML as well in a separate field.
[11:21:13] <kswedberg> oh, cool.
[11:22:04] <jzaefferer> hey kswedberg, you should consider adding the xslt to the repo, that way people can save-and-refresh the xml files without uploading to WordPress. Its simple enough with <?xml-stylesheet, see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-docs/blob/master/jquery/jQuery.ajax/jQuery.ajax.xml#L1-2
[11:25:00] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: ok. so prepend (not a word!) those first 2 lines to every entry file?
[11:25:22] <jzaefferer> pretty much, adjust the path the xslt accordingly
[11:25:32] <kswedberg> right. cool
[11:26:47] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: one other thing I haven't done yet is extract the <example>s from the entries and put them into their own files. is that still a thing that y'all want to have happen?
[11:27:00] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: no idea
[11:27:19] <jzaefferer> Richard might have an opinion on that
[11:27:40] <kswedberg> ok. I wasn't around for that discussion. kborchers: do you know what the rationale was for that? ^^
[11:27:46] <danheberden> i was the only one insisting on the idea, but whatevs
[11:28:00] <danheberden> just so that they were portable/external/easy-to-work-on
[11:28:01] <kswedberg> danheberden: figures. :p
[11:28:02] <danheberden> blah blah blah
[11:28:07] <danheberden> INORITE?!
[11:28:18] <kswedberg> JUST KIDDING!!;;;;;;
[11:28:28] <danheberden> haha
[11:29:12] <kborchers> kswedberg: sorry no, i don't think i was around for that either
[11:29:38] <kborchers> ; sorry, forgot my semicolon on that last line;
[11:29:58] <kswedberg> kborchers: hahaha;
[11:31:31] <kswedberg> kborchers: ok. danheberden, if you don't mind, let's just leave as is for now. we can change later if it causes problems. unless it'll make our lives a lot better by changing it now
[11:31:34] <kswedberg> ;
[11:31:52] <danheberden> ; /ragequit
[11:32:51] <kborchers> works for me;
[11:33:49] <danheberden>  `Exception: semicolon missing on line 0`
[11:34:23] <kborchers> lol
[12:10:49] <gnarf> hey danheberden nacin - i gotta jump on a plane, but that work looks good so far, might see you in my layover - might be tomorrow - either way, keep on truckin' !
[12:13:32] <nacin> gnarf: safe flight!
[13:37:54] <gnarf> nacin: are the config files on the server now mostly stable?
[13:38:06] <nacin> gnarf: mostly
[13:38:19] <nacin> I created a .config/, not sure how you wanted to handle that.
[13:38:50] <nacin> gnarf: also not necessary; it could all be moved into wp-config.
[13:40:11] <gnarf> coo
[13:40:13] <gnarf> looks good
[13:40:45] <gnarf> i might move some of that multisite back into the wp-config and try to make the multi-site just the sites defined to make it easier to puppet that part of the config as well
[13:41:24] <gnarf> nacin: out of curiosity
[13:41:42] <gnarf> could i have it automatically strip a prefixed "stage." from the HTTP_HOST there and everything would still work?
[13:43:59] <gnarf> nacin: this is nice... definitely helpful having ya around :)
[13:45:01] <gnarf> now i just need to get danheberden's post commit hooks wired in for web-base-template
[13:48:03] <gnarf> welp - packing up for a bit- maybe see you from cincinnati airport wifi
[13:53:11] <nacin> gnarf: absolutely, very easy to handle staging servers. will want to do a bit more than stripping stage, to ensure everything working.
[13:53:41] <nacin> gnarf: wondering if they should actually use different sites in the DB, rather than using the live DB. up to you guys.

[19:16:12] <DaveMethvin> i think we might as well make it the default though
[19:16:22] <DaveMethvin> at least that way if it adds bytes it's for better performance
[19:16:38] <mikesherov> sure, I'm all for that

[19:20:08] <snover> bot-t: any messages for me?
[19:20:09] <bot-t> snover, Yes - definitely.
[19:20:12] <snover> bot-t: can I have them?
[19:20:13] <bot-t> snover, Ask again later.
[19:20:14] <DaveMethvin> well THAT worked
[19:20:27] <DaveMethvin> ;
[19:20:35] <DaveMethvin> so much shorter
[19:20:57] <DaveMethvin> if bot-t just supported ASI i wouldnt need to type a character
[19:21:01] <DaveMethvin> first world problems
[19:22:03] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[19:22:05] <mikesherov>  
[19:22:25] <mikesherov> bot-t: are you an asshole?
[19:22:26] <bot-t> mikesherov, My reply is no.
[19:22:33] <mikesherov> well, that's good

[19:28:33] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: PR updated: https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/commit/e3f0fe80b2d6f873f0bc6ce224a12453c8165f66
[19:28:34] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by mikesherov (52.926s ago): ok, so we do want to break back compat for those daring to use jQuery to reach into IFRAMES on .ready
[19:28:45] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[19:29:00] <mikesherov> no problem
[19:37:49] <mikesherov> Just released Pulley 0.1.7!
[20:30:34] <gnarf> nacin1: we have a separate server for stage
[20:31:12] <nacin> gnarf: servers, yes, but live DB?
[20:31:30] <gnarf> nacin: so like jq01 = "live db"
[20:31:37] <gnarf> nacin: jq01.stage = "staging server"
[20:31:46] <gnarf> with a "staging db"
[20:31:54] <nacin> okay, that last part is what I was curious about.
[20:32:07] <gnarf> jq01 and jq01.stage will have the exact same server configs
[20:32:28] <gnarf> only diff will be that jq01.stage will pull from master always, and jq01 will only pull when people want to "push" a release
[20:32:47] <nacin> gotcha. both WP.com and WP.org use live databases on staging/dev.
