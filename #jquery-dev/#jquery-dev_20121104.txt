[00:07:16] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8685#comment:10 -- I'd really like to be able to sneak out a new 1.8 fix for this and not have to wait until 1.9 to get it stable
[00:07:26] <gnarf> cc mikesherov
[00:07:36] <gnarf> cc timmywil
[00:07:55] <gnarf> I'll try to have it done by meeting
[06:04:30] <mikesherov> gnarf: glad
[08:38:16] <gnarf> mikesherov: glad? :)
[08:43:21] <gnarf> mikesherov: did you see my comments on pull 1015?  Curious what you think about that unit approach
[08:43:44] <mikesherov> seems a bit crazy
[08:44:05] <mikesherov> But what else could you do really?
[08:44:22] <gnarf> use fake timers
[08:44:26] <gnarf> which i want anyway
[08:44:33] <gnarf> in the effects tests
[08:45:56] <gnarf> we could get things so much more efficient if we used something like sinon's clock API: http://sinonjs.org/docs/#clock-api
[08:48:45] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yt?
[08:49:22] <mikesherov> gnarf: sinon is awesome
[08:59:41] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: sup?
[09:04:47] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you see my post about see ?8685
[09:04:49] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, [#8685] Animations should keep track of animation state in order to properly address stacked animations (reopened enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/8685
[09:05:04] <gnarf> we regressed pretty hard in 1.8.0 on this
[09:05:09] <DaveMethvin> oh that's not good
[09:05:15] <gnarf> yeah
[09:05:19] <DaveMethvin> i guess a unit test would have helped
[09:05:22] <gnarf> i plan on hacking a fix tonight
[09:05:28] <gnarf> i think we TRIED to unit these
[09:05:31] <gnarf> but it didn't work
[09:05:47] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: I think this is serious enough to want to push a 1.8.3
[09:06:00] <DaveMethvin> it took quite a while for anyone to report
[09:06:05] <gnarf> i dunno why
[09:06:25] <gnarf> I just found it while I was working on a slide for my asia presentation
[09:06:57] <DaveMethvin> in any case we have a branch and i can cherry pick your fix into it
[09:07:02] <DaveMethvin> and then we can decide
[09:07:57] <gnarf> I'd really like to be able to just say "broken in 1.8.0 - 1.8.2" instead of "wait til 1.9 for the fix"
[09:08:17] <DaveMethvin> well yeah and 1.9 will "break" a lot of other stuff
[09:08:23] <DaveMethvin> so maybe we wait a month and 1.8.3
[09:09:02] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: maybe if you think there might be something else out there to squeeze in, otherwise I'd kinda like to push this fix out quick
[09:09:25] <DaveMethvin> is it really that critical?
[09:09:50] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: IMO - yes - it breaks one of the easier/more useful uses of .toggle animations
[09:10:07] <DaveMethvin> it was broken forever before that though, right?
[09:10:12] <DaveMethvin> 1.7 was the only shining moment
[09:10:23] <gnarf> I suppose
[09:10:44] <DaveMethvin> if we're putting out a 1.8.3 i don't want there to be a 1.8.4
[09:10:48] <DaveMethvin> we need to focus on 1.9
[09:11:08] <DaveMethvin> so if it took this long for a "critical" bug to surface there could be others
[09:11:17] <DaveMethvin> so that's why i was thinking we may want to wait
[09:12:32] <gnarf> Sure - I'm thinking I have to give a presentation on this and want to say it's fixed (again) :)
[09:12:38] <gnarf> in like 8 days
[09:12:55] <DaveMethvin> regardless you can say it'll be fixed in 1.8.3
[09:13:00] <gnarf> true
[09:13:27] <DaveMethvin> i think this is the only addl fix, or have others arrived in the last couple of weeks?
[09:13:57] <DaveMethvin> so it would be 1.8-stable plus your fix ==> 1.8.3
[09:14:19] <gnarf> yeah - I'll base my fix in 1.8-stable i think
[09:14:27] <gnarf> make sure it merges to master too
[09:14:40] <DaveMethvin> that would be great
[11:28:29] <jqcommit> [testswarm] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/h3Y6zQ
[11:28:29] <jqcommit> testswarm/master 40017c2 Mike Sherov: make sure the run page iframe doesn't cause scrollbars which can pollute IE8 environments
[11:30:27] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: how do you feel about sinon?
[11:30:33] <gnarf> I'd really like to use its timer stubs
[11:30:44] <gnarf> would RULE for these new tests
[11:31:04] <mikesherov> :-)
[11:32:11] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i saw that discussion upstream, sounds like a good idea if we could remove the timing-related fails we're always seeing in ajax and effects ... /cc gnarf
[11:32:43] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: is it going to slow down landing this fix if i write it with sinon?
[11:32:53] <scott_gonzalez> I've seen fails caused by including sinon.
[11:33:07] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we should land this for 1.8.3
[11:33:10] <scott_gonzalez> I think it overwrites window.setTimeout()
[11:33:13] <DaveMethvin> sinon that is
[11:33:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it does
[11:33:26] <DaveMethvin> let's tackle it for 1.9
[11:33:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thats the whole idea - is that you can solidly rely on the "timing" in the unit
[11:34:12] <gnarf> basically lets you force every test to be sync instead of async
[11:34:42] <gnarf> but the timing will be theoretically perfect
[13:17:25] <gnarf> mikesherov: you around?
