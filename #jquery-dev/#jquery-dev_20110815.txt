[07:16:32] <rwaldron> ?tell jaubourg I found some FF4 code that you can remove :D
[07:16:38] <rwaldron> ack
[09:01:32] <DaveMethvin> meeting today?
[09:02:32] <JohnResig> think so
[09:02:37] <rwaldron> hey guys
[09:02:37] <bot-t1> (12 hours 10 mins ago) <snover> Tell rwaldron belated hi-bye!
[09:28:54] <timmywil> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381#comment:29
[09:29:00] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron is there a lot of stuff that we can ditch now?
[09:29:03] <timmywil> would anyone like to be assigned that?
[09:29:10] <rwaldron> nice timmywil
[09:29:17] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin not sure yet
[09:29:21] <rwaldron> its a tough process
[09:29:43] <rwaldron> because we havent always been super awesome about identifying issues in code comments that are UA specific
[09:29:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:29:59] <timmywil> I'll assign to myself then
[09:30:18] <DaveMethvin> I've tried to incorporate more tix in comments, but without cluttering too much
[09:30:23] <rwaldron> so basically, it occurred to me that some junk in my defaultDisplay code was there to satisfy Firefox 3.0.x
[09:30:32] <rwaldron> which has almost no share anymore
[09:30:37] <rwaldron> its not even on the chart
[09:30:54] <rwaldron> and that got me thinking about the potential to find gems that can simply go
[09:31:06] <rwaldron> so, i'm setting out to find them
[09:31:10] <ajpiano> hmm so we're just backing out RAF
[09:31:21] <ajpiano> gnarf's talk title will make less sense now :p
[09:31:24] <DaveMethvin> if it's in github the blame view may be helpful
[09:31:29] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin same ehre
[09:31:33] <DaveMethvin> oh ajpiano good catch
[09:31:37] <DaveMethvin> er
[09:31:49] <rwaldron> its a fine line between being thorough and completely vague
[09:31:56] <rwaldron> if that makes sense
[09:32:01] <rwaldron> which it doesnt
[09:32:17] <DaveMethvin> which means its a good example of the concept :P
[09:32:22] <rwaldron> <3
[09:32:29] <rwaldron> thanks for picking me up when i was down
[09:46:29] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin re: VML and event.target.nodeType
[09:46:37] <DaveMethvin> slowly i turned ...
[09:46:41] <rwaldron> instead of that dumb try/catch
[09:46:46] <rwaldron> why not just...
[09:47:07] <rwaldron> "nodeType" in event.target && event.target.nodeType === 3
[09:47:15] <rwaldron> to avoid blow up
[09:47:24] <rwaldron> or am i over simplifying?
[09:47:37] <DaveMethvin> i don't think event.target will suport "in" but i could be wrong
[09:47:40] <DaveMethvin> it's a host object
[09:47:48] <DaveMethvin> worse, it's an IE host object
[09:47:50] * rwaldron shrugs
[09:48:07] <DaveMethvin> do we have a test case?
[09:48:10] <rwaldron> i dont really feel like testing
[09:48:14] <rwaldron> no
[09:48:21] <DaveMethvin> i thought i asked the guy for one
[09:48:30] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[09:48:37] <rwaldron> because honestly... http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix
[09:48:43] <rwaldron> http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix#SVG.2FXML.2FVML_Bugs
[09:49:32] <rwaldron> he references the exact ticket we've stated is the root of the wont fix decision
[09:49:40] <rwaldron> 7071
[09:50:16] <DaveMethvin> well we fixed a couple of vml bugs in 1.6 i think
[09:50:29] <DaveMethvin> i noticed them in the event code
[09:50:36] <rwaldron> so?
[09:50:36] <Lampoon> so are you
[09:51:08] <DaveMethvin> the problem with them is that the event bubbles up so it makes use of vml in a page impossible even if jQuery isn't doing anything with it
[09:51:16] <rwaldron> ok
[09:51:18] <DaveMethvin> so i have some sympathy
[09:51:24] <DaveMethvin> although i dislike the solution here
[09:51:26] <rwaldron> you're kind
[09:51:29] <rwaldron> same here
[09:51:37] <rwaldron> i'd like to try my solution
[09:51:47] <rwaldron> but i'm not really interested in spending the time on it
[09:51:51] * rwaldron shrugs
[09:51:53] <rwaldron> i need lunch
[09:52:06] <rwaldron> maybe i'll feel differently after
[09:52:07] <DaveMethvin> it's limited enough that the try/catch isn't likely to catch anything else , but if we get a test case maybe i can get zac to try a few things
[09:52:13] <DaveMethvin> eat!
[13:41:27] <DaveMethvin> timmywil rwaldron ajpiano paul_irish do any of you know where docs#6485 stands? It's slated for 1.7 but needs a sugar daddy
[13:41:28] <bot-t1> [#6485] Solution for HTML5 in IE (open feature) - http://jqbug.com/6485
[13:41:48] <timmywil> i vote paul_irish
[13:41:50] <rwaldron> I honestly havent been following it lately
[13:42:06] <DaveMethvin> i thought we got all the 1.7 things assigned but this one is blank owner
[13:42:25] <timmywil> or possibly jon neal.  they've been working on a solution
[13:42:37] <rwaldron> this ticket is loaded
[13:42:48] <rwaldron> its a long term commitment
[13:42:55] <rwaldron> post release support and all
[13:42:58] <DaveMethvin> i'm afraid of commitment
[13:43:39] <DaveMethvin> also afraid of file size
[13:43:57] <timmywil> the initial solution needs to get fleshed out.  I won't have time with all the stuff I have, but I think whatever they work out we can support.
[13:44:07] <rwaldron> at one point I started working on tooling somehing that would allow the creation of _any_ element on the fly
[13:44:12] <rwaldron> which is ideal
[13:44:23] <rwaldron> instead of having a string list somwhere
[13:44:55] <DaveMethvin> cmon timmywil you're just rewriting Sizzle, right? :P
[13:45:05] <DaveMethvin> how hard can THAT be?
[13:45:16] <timmywil> hehe
[13:45:32] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron has us all beat on PRs right now
[13:45:45] <rwaldron> I'm curating bit-rot
[13:45:47] <rwaldron> :P
[13:46:01] <DaveMethvin> those bits ain't gonna clean themselves
[13:46:12] <rwaldron> how about this
[13:46:15] <rwaldron> assign it to me
[13:46:23] <rwaldron> and I'll see how far I can take it
[13:46:28] <paul_irish> oh hai
[13:46:35] <timmywil> yay!
[13:46:35] <DaveMethvin> GET EM BOYS!
[13:46:42] * rwaldron pushes paul_irish in front
[13:46:45] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:46:49] <rwaldron> i was just kidding, he wants to do it
[13:46:51] <rwaldron> :P
[13:47:07] <timmywil> so paul, we need to assign the html5 ticket
[13:47:13] <DaveMethvin> so ... docs#6485
[13:47:14] <rwaldron> but for real, paul_irish as I recall you weren;t sure what knd of commitment you could make, correct?
[13:47:14] <bot-t1> [#6485] Solution for HTML5 in IE (open feature) - http://jqbug.com/6485
[13:47:28] <rwaldron> I'm willing to see it through, or at least try
[13:48:25] <DaveMethvin> although rick i think you have a pretty big plate o stuff already
[13:48:48] <paul_irish> let's assign to rwaldron and i'll skype and shit with him to work it out
[13:48:58] <rwaldron> crashlove it
[13:49:02] <rwaldron> -crash
[13:49:04] <paul_irish> :)
[13:49:09] <rwaldron> just, ya know.. love it.
[13:49:11] <rwaldron> thanks paul_irish
[13:49:21] <paul_irish> <3
[13:49:23] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin not too big
[13:49:30] <rwaldron> mostly just event property hooks
[13:49:38] <rwaldron> i already finished moving fixed position
[13:49:41] * rwaldron dances
[13:49:55] <rwaldron> trimmin' the fat
[13:51:09] <rwaldron> HA!
[13:51:12] <DaveMethvin> k, rwaldron, you're the proud owner of 6485
[13:51:16] <rwaldron> quote from crockford...
[13:51:19] <rwaldron> "I think you are probably right. They could have done a good thing, but getters and setters gave them a license to continue doing the bad thing. So ultimately they took a lot longer to finally adopt jQuery."
[13:51:21] <timmywil> rwaldron: grats!
[13:51:24] <rwaldron> with regard to MS
[13:54:25] <rwaldron> oh no... is this for real? http://www.conceivablytech.com/8873/products/firefox-to-drop-version-numbers-entirely
[13:55:13] <DaveMethvin> why not ... it's alrady true for chrome
[13:55:24] <rwaldron> but a version number exists
[13:55:32] <DaveMethvin> so are they gonna force-update too?
[13:55:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah no doubt a number wll be in there
[13:55:42] <rwaldron> they alrady do
[13:55:42] <DaveMethvin> but not in your face
[13:55:45] <rwaldron> already*
[13:56:02] <DaveMethvin> chrome just magically starts and my number is higher, don't think ff does that
[13:56:07] <rwaldron> Beginning with FF5, they do auto update
[13:56:27] <DaveMethvin> i updated to ff6 this weekend so i didn't wait for the auto ... :)
[13:57:18] <rwaldron> I have 3 going
[13:57:29] <rwaldron> FF Stable, Aurora and Nightly
[13:57:45] <rwaldron> + a zany try build for game controller suport
[13:57:47] <rwaldron> support
[13:57:58] <DaveMethvin> i figure if someone complains about a bug in ff<6 we can just tell them to upgrade
[13:58:12] <DaveMethvin> only a couple of tix left to be assigned for 1.7 ... gnarf do you want docs#5684 and docs#4660?
[13:58:14] <bot-t1> [#5684] Effects: exception in animation callback causes endless loop (open enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/5684
[13:58:17] <bot-t1> DaveMethvin, #4660 (fadeTo() does not fade-in elements after hide() or fadeOut ... - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4660
[13:59:07] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin somewhere in the weekly meeting notes, I made a motion to look towards changing FF support to Current-1 in the near future
[13:59:14] <rwaldron> we have to wait out the 3.6 stragglers
[13:59:20] <rwaldron> then all good
[13:59:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah it makes sense
[13:59:35] <rwaldron> mozilla is actively pushing out "reminder to upgrade" notices
[13:59:38] <rwaldron> but guess what...
[13:59:45] <rwaldron> you;re gonna love this
[14:00:23] <rwaldron> FF3.6 was the last stable release that mozilla pushed to it's 500K or so enterprise clients
[14:00:36] <rwaldron> and they aren't happy about the fast paced version changes
[14:00:44] <rwaldron> 3.6 will be the new IE6,7,8
[14:00:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah i heard about that
[14:01:18] <DaveMethvin> the corp types want to test it, deploy it, and never change it for 5 years
[14:01:57] <DaveMethvin> i swear, we should put in a feature for jquery that just does random shit every 100th run if they're running old stuff
[15:34:10] <gnarf> removing raf doesn't actually fix anything though... it just hides the problem
[15:34:11] <bot-t1> (66 hours 50 mins ago) <kborchers> tell gnarf we forgot about overflow-x and overflow-y so i updated it to check for those instead of just overflow. thanks to scott for pointing that one out
[15:34:50] <gnarf> but i suppose backing it out is better than adding a flag
[15:35:01] <paul_irish> rwaldron: moz will take the same approach as chrome, as best as they can
[15:35:11] <paul_irish> there will be version numbers for developers
[15:35:14] <paul_irish> as always
[15:44:08] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin "i swear, we should put in a feature for jquery that just does random shit every 100th run if they're running old stuff" +9001
[15:45:19] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i agree removing raf doesn't fix the problem with raf, but it does fix the problem caused by raf :P
[15:45:44] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: actually it just makes it less noticable
[15:45:49] <DaveMethvin> it doesnt fix the problem caused by slow tickers
[15:46:31] <DaveMethvin> i dunno if there is a solution short of sending all web developers to a re-education camp
[15:46:40] <gnarf> basically my argument is that there isn't anything "wrong" with the behavior in jQuery, there is something wrong with the people using it
[15:46:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and which one is easier to change? :(
[15:47:38] <gnarf> given, but how long do we need to hold everyones hand before we just say "This feature is way useful for you guys, not to mention, if you're having problems with the raf, you'll have other problems later"
[15:48:03] <rwaldron> gnarf " basically my argument is that there isn't anything "wrong" with the behavior in jQuery, there is something wrong with the people using it"
[15:48:06] <rwaldron> yep.
[15:48:12] <DaveMethvin> well if raf is the right way to go we need the browser makers to lead the way in saying so
[15:48:18] <rwaldron> i've been saying this since that ticket was filed.
[15:48:22] <DaveMethvin> b/c we are getting the heat for it
[15:48:22] <rwaldron> and long before that
[15:48:37] <DaveMethvin> and i totally agree with the sentiment that created raf and slow timers
[15:48:40] <gnarf> rwaldron: so have I, in fact I have MULTIPLE comments on the ticket showing ways around it
[15:48:45] <DaveMethvin> it IS the right way to go
[15:49:02] <gnarf> and plan on spending at least 5 minutes talking about ways around it in my talk @ jqconf :)
[15:49:08] <rwaldron> gnarf I explained to the dude the first day a simple work around
[15:49:08] <DaveMethvin> i know, but <whine>then i have to change MY code</whine>
[15:49:26] <DaveMethvin> isn't it easier for you jqueries guys to wave a magic wand or something?
[15:49:29] <rwaldron> but he insisted that his unique snowflake use case was way more complex then i could understand
[15:49:38] <rwaldron> which really means he wrote shit code
[15:49:40] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: <whine>I have to remove a great feature from jQuery cuz some dipshit doesn't want to code it right?</whine>
[15:49:42] <rwaldron> and is now paying for it
[15:49:43] <DaveMethvin> lol
[15:50:07] <rwaldron> i have an idea
[15:50:19] <rwaldron> default jQuery to not use rAF
[15:50:24] <rwaldron> but leave it in
[15:50:26] <DaveMethvin> well gnarf if  you feel strongly about it we can reopen the discussion, honestly ... ajpiano mentioned your jqcon session after we got out of the mtg
[15:50:31] <rwaldron> with an undocumented switch
[15:50:39] <rwaldron> jQuery UI and mobile can use it
[15:50:44] <rwaldron> and fuck everyone else
[15:50:52] <rwaldron> it's their punishment for complaining
[15:51:14] <rwaldron> brb
[15:51:52] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: I feel about as strong on this topic as I did on my losing argument for handholding the .prop .attr switch
[15:52:08] <gnarf> cuz now we have a .prop and a halfassed .attr that we are stuck with cause of some legacy
[15:52:31] <gnarf> although raf is much easier to pull
[15:52:35] <gnarf> and noone will ever notice
[15:52:46] <DaveMethvin> well gnarf on the attr stuff i think we're committed to removing the stuff eventually ... maybe the mythical 2.0
[15:52:51] * gnarf fights within himself
[15:52:58] <gnarf> i see both sides of it
[15:53:10] <gnarf> i just think removing it because of like the 3 guys actually bitching about it is silly
[15:53:15] <DaveMethvin> but for raf, yeah, i dunno
[15:53:29] <DaveMethvin> we need some way to shut up the whiners
[15:53:39] <gnarf> i think the flag to disable it gives us that
[15:53:42] <DaveMethvin> if we are going to keep it in long term maybe the flag is still the easy way to go
[15:53:49] <gnarf> and gives us time to write the "correct" solution
[15:54:13] <DaveMethvin> so would we want to keep the flag into eternity, or is there some reason we shoudl pull it?
[15:54:29] <DaveMethvin> atm we just can use the feature detect flag
[15:54:30] <gnarf> which we still haven't seen yet, but there is a really good chance it will require a rewrite of animate
[15:54:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[15:55:02] <DaveMethvin> honestly i just love the css transition stuff b/c it's declarative
[15:56:18] <DaveMethvin> well i think we could make the argument that if we're doing something as big as pulling raf support it should be done in a major version
[15:56:26] <DaveMethvin> really 1.6.3 shoudl be bug fixes
[15:56:31] <DaveMethvin> and this isn't really a bug
[15:56:49] <DaveMethvin> the flag would be low impact
[15:56:58] <DaveMethvin> if we left raf enabled by default
[16:05:51] <gnarf> I think its better to keep it in there
[16:06:10] <gnarf> for every dude that complains on that ticket, there are prolly 10 dudes who think using raf is cool
[16:08:24] <gnarf> plus, i also agree that pulling a feature in a point release sounds iffy
[16:08:48] <gnarf> adding the support flag seems less "crappy"
[16:09:00] <gnarf> and still gives us a "solution" to stop the whiners for now
[16:12:41] <gnarf> gotta run, busy ass day - talk later
