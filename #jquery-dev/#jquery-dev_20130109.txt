[08:15:49] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: Mike recently commented on some code that was doing .whatever( "string" ), he said it should be .whatever("string") - where in the style guide is that, and can we get rid of it?
[08:16:07] <jzaefferer> in general, what happened to the discussion about the style guide? Did you hear anything from rwaldron about that?
[08:17:24] <DaveMethvin> the guide says that a single string arg doesn't need spaces  jzaefferer
[08:17:36] <jzaefferer> doesn't need or can't have?
[08:17:45] <DaveMethvin> shouldn't  have
[08:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I've asked that question a million times.
[08:17:57] <jzaefferer> also can we drop that sucker?
[08:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> Nobody is ever willing to say "must not"
[08:18:12] <jzaefferer> its useless if it doesn't enforce consistency
[08:18:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah, in the core meeting rwaldron said we were going to look into that tool you mentioned
[08:18:33] <DaveMethvin> i agree it's inconsistent
[08:18:54] <DaveMethvin> http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines search for single
[08:19:37] <DaveMethvin> i'm moving those from docs.jquery.com to contribute.jquery.com as we speak
[08:20:18] <DaveMethvin> there's also the question of func( arg[ x ] ) versus func( arg[x] )
[08:20:32] <DaveMethvin> like, how deep to apply the "spaces around parens and braces" rule
[08:20:43] <DaveMethvin> that seems to be dealer's choice
[08:21:06] <DaveMethvin> the style guide says "is allowed"
[08:21:29] <DaveMethvin> i want a computer to just tell me what it wants
[08:23:19] <jzaefferer> get rid of the exceptions?

[12:23:22] <_|Nix|_> If anybody's around: Is there a way to take a given selector and refine it (in my case) with an additional :not()?
[12:24:07] <_|Nix|_> I've been using ":not(:not(" + originalSelector + ")):not(my criteria)" so far, but I'd like to avoid the double negative.
[12:24:45] <_|Nix|_> So, the semantics are supposed to be "whatever the original value, but only if my criteria are not met".
[12:25:04] <_|Nix|_> I guess what I need is a bracket operator.
[12:25:24] <_|Nix|_> There was supposed to be ":any()" or something like that. Whatever became of that?
[12:29:34] <_|Nix|_> Here's a thread about :any(): http://forum.jquery.com/topic/feature-req-any-selector-filter
[12:44:56] <paul_irish> mikesherov: saw the //@ sourceMappingURL=dist/jquery.min.map
[12:44:58] <paul_irish> so pumped.
[12:45:08] <mikesherov> :-)
[12:45:17] <mikesherov> glad I could oblige
[12:45:21] <paul_irish> i can make you a new and better  video
[12:45:24] <paul_irish> to explain it
[12:45:26] <paul_irish> for 1.9 final
[12:45:33] <mikesherov> yes, that would be awesome
[12:46:01] <mikesherov> paul_irish: definitely do that
[12:46:12] <paul_irish> when do you need it by
[12:46:19] <paul_irish> ish
[12:46:40] <ajpiano> 1.9 final is gonna be on mon, according to DaveMethvin :)
[12:47:16] <DaveMethvin> make us a video paul_irish!
[12:47:24] <paul_irish> ohboy ok
[12:47:41] <ajpiano> paul_irish: but really like any time in the two weeks after we are gonna be posting lots of shit
[12:47:48] <DaveMethvin> all the CDNs are on board, Microsoft says they're happy to host the map file
[12:47:55] <paul_irish> word
[12:48:05] <paul_irish> its an easy win
[12:48:07] <paul_irish> i'm excited.
[12:48:11] <mikesherov> me too
[12:51:24] <_|Nix|_> Can any of you guys help me? I've tried to use :not(:not()) to bracket an existing selector, but now I'm getting an error: "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [type]), input[type='file']" ...
[12:51:33] <_|Nix|_> Here's the selector: https://gist.github.com/4496811
[12:51:48] <_|Nix|_> Looks perfectly valid to me (albeit a bit long).
[12:52:05] <_|Nix|_> I'm using jQuery 1.8.3 ...
[13:01:43] <snover> _|Nix|_: please read the topic. this is not a support channel.
[13:04:15] <_|Nix|_> snover: Well, I'm pretty sure it's a bug in sizzle. I'm stepping through the tokenizer as we speak. I was just hoping you guys could quickly eliminate any obvious brain damage.
[13:04:21] <ajpiano> _|Nix|_: why would you ever be trying to do that inside of a single selector :/
[13:04:37] <ajpiano> snover: _|Nix|_ is a jqm dev
[13:04:46] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Because I have a selector that's given, and I need to restrict it.
[13:05:02] <ajpiano> why not use a .not() method call after?
[13:05:03] <gibson042>  _|Nix|_ it does appear to be a Sizzle bug
[13:05:28] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Because this is not on a jQuery object. This is simply a string that will later be used to construct a jQuery object.
[13:05:40] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: It's the initSelector for a widget class.
[13:05:59] <snover> :not(:not()) is not valid css
[13:06:51] <ajpiano> _|Nix|_: ok, had a feeling it was something like hthat
[13:10:09] <ajpiano> yeah i didn't know we supported or tried to support  :not(:not()) i
[13:11:18] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: There are other ways of doing it, and I might have to resort to them, but this seemed like the least invasive. And it used to work, too ... http://web-ui-fw.github.com/web-ui-fw/js/web-ui-fw.js:6758 ... that was with 1.6.4
[13:11:35] <ajpiano> 404
[13:11:53] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Well, yes ... I added the :6758 myself.
[13:12:12] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: It's a big file. I guess you can search for :not(:not(
[13:12:13] <ajpiano> ah
[13:33:02] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: My initial suspicion is matchExpr.PSEUDO ... It matches, but the match is passed into preFilter, and match[0] is the whole selector minus the last character.
[13:33:26] <gibson042> _|Nix|_ you're on the right track
[13:34:17] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: Wait ... it's not match[0], but match[4]
[13:34:24] <gibson042> the actual issue seems to be rpseudo.test(unquoted) in the pseudo prefilter
[13:34:35] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: Of course, match[0] is always the whole thing.
[13:34:35] <gibson042> I've gone back and forth with timmywil on this a few times
[13:35:22] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: Awesome. I'm a turtle compared to you guys :)
[13:36:07] <gibson042> it's just familiarity ;)
[13:37:15] <timmywil> without looking further, my guess it's cutting it off at :jqmData()
[13:37:16] <gibson042> _|Nix|_ I have to take off now, but I'll look at this again in a few hours
[13:37:28] <timmywil> is it's*
[13:38:00] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: Great! Thanks!
[13:38:12] <gibson042> timmywil it's not :jqmData(), it's that "[type]), input[type='file']" doesn't match rpseudo so Sizzle recognizes that string as the argument for :not
[13:38:22] <gibson042> rather than the "[type]" that it should
[13:38:54] <gibson042> at the "Only check arguments that contain a pseudo" line in the pseudo preFilter
[13:39:40] <gibson042> my guess is that we'll fix it by replacing "rpseudo.test(unquoted)" with "( unquoted.indexOf(")") !== -1 || rpseudo.test(unquoted) )"
[13:39:44] <_|Nix|_> Does it matter that match[4] has unbalanced brackets?
[13:40:03] <gibson042> timmywil: which will once again disallow unquoted parens ;)
[13:40:28] <gibson042> _|Nix|_ no, in fact that should be the case because we're using match[4] to *find* the correct closing parenthesis
[13:40:38] <gibson042> anyway, I'm out for now
[13:40:44] <gibson042> please open a ticket if you haven't yet
[13:40:53] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: OK, I understand. Can do. L8R!
[13:43:08] <timmywil> _|Nix|_: I don't see a syntax error against jquery git
[13:43:22] <timmywil> http://jsbin.com/ederov/1/
[13:43:44] <timmywil> 1.8.3 may not have all of the pseudo fixes
[13:44:30] <_|Nix|_> timmywil: OK. That's great!
[13:44:34] <timmywil> I switched out jqmData for a contains, but it's the same way
[13:44:42] <timmywil> parsed the same way*
[13:45:00] <_|Nix|_> timmywil: All the more reason we should move up ...
[13:47:41] <_|Nix|_> timmywil: I guess then you can close http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13184
[13:47:55] <timmywil> will do, thanks _|Nix|_ 
[13:53:23] <DaveMethvin> man that's one SCARY selector, i cannot imagine what it takes to parse and execute
[14:10:38] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: recursive tokenization ;)
[14:13:16] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: I am assuming the next version of sizzle will optimize the redundant gEBTN("input") calls into a single one, then convert the type attr comparisons to a single regexp check. can you get to that by next week? :D
[14:14:17] <timmywil> I'll just delegate to gibson
[14:14:30] <DaveMethvin> haah
[14:14:43] <DaveMethvin> you sizzle guys
[15:59:28] <gibson042> ?tell timmywil I thought all the pseudo fixes made it in for 1.8.3, but it looks like you were right. False alarm!
[15:59:30] <bot-t1> gibson042, Okay.
