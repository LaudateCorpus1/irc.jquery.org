[14:36:00] <amit_sh> how can i contribute to jquery?
[14:42:27] <amit_sh> helo?? 
[14:42:45] <amit_sh> some tips would be great
[18:30:35] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG, I'm going crazy. Who wants to help debug an issue?
[18:34:53] <DaveMethvin> what did you do *this* time scott_gonzalez? :)
[18:35:09] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to return a value from a function.
[18:35:17] <DaveMethvin> YOU FOOL
[18:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> Crazy, I know, but I thought the JS engine would allow it to work.
[18:35:29] <scott_gonzalez> Got a few minutes to look at this?
[18:35:34] <DaveMethvin> sure

[19:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> Who's next? Anyone else want to check out my alternate reality where functions refuse to return values?
[19:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: So I pulled the method out of the prototype and now it works.
[19:26:42] <DaveMethvin> you know that doesn't make sense though, right? :)
[19:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I know.
[19:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> But at least I have working code now.
[19:27:11] <DaveMethvin> thats always good.
[21:03:30] <snover> scott_gonzalez: i am interested in your alternate reality
