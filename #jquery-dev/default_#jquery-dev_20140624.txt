[03:53:48] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15Krinkle opened pull request #1605: core: Consistently use local reference to access() (06master...06optim-access) 02http://git.io/6FZMRg
[03:54:31] <Krinkle> We've got a spammer problem
[03:56:36] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/3b53b75160#commitcomment-6776927 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1605 got an immediate reply from a spammer
[03:56:44] <Krinkle> using github's reply-by-email feature. Great..
[05:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: I reported him, but then I realized it's not actually a spammer.
[05:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> His email address must be misconfigured. Those are actually undeliverable replies.
[05:31:28] <scott_gonzalez> His replies started yesterday.
[05:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> It's been fun deleting his response since it happens for every single PR/issue/comment...
[05:32:37] <Krinkle> I think you can block him. Any organisation you have access to will inherit that block
[05:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> I can try that.
[05:32:55] <Krinkle> Though you might not want to block him.
[05:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'll wait for a reply from GitHub first.
[05:33:07] <Krinkle> I guess it's because he "Watches" the jquery project.
[05:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:33:26] <Krinkle> Right, I guess GitHub isn't recognising the mail as a bounce
[05:33:26] <scott_gonzalez> He doesn't seem to have any legit activity.
[05:33:50] <Krinkle> If there even is a standard bounce format.
[05:34:07] <Krinkle> Wouldn't be surprised if it comprises of a legion of string matches and regexes for common mail servers.
[05:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> probably
[06:11:07] <Hawkfire> hi all
[06:12:00] <Hawkfire> I want to know how can I describe disabled times or allowed times in jquery simple datetime picker
[06:12:07] <Hawkfire> who can help me about this?
[06:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> Hawkfire: #jquery can help you.
[06:12:35] <Hawkfire> thank you very much
[06:12:50] <Hawkfire> I will go on
[06:14:45] <Krinkle> Hm.. been trying to figure out what's going on with grunt output colors
[06:14:50] <Krinkle> https://integration.wikimedia.org/ci/job/mwext-VisualEditor-qunit/10252/console#grunt-test
[06:15:05] <Krinkle> Perhaps someone have an idea what could cause the reset color to not be recognised?
[06:15:40] <Krinkle> I suspect it's caused by a dependency of grunt changing in a recent update
[06:23:05] <kswedberg> Krinkle: not sure if this is the issue, but at some point they stopped using a module that extended String prototype and started using `chalk` (https://www.npmjs.org/package/chalk)
[06:24:21] <Krinkle> kswedberg: interesting, I was looking at the color module indeed
[06:24:32] <Krinkle> colors.js is what grunt and grunt-legacy-log depend on 
[06:24:51] <Krinkle> Maybe they switched again? from color > chalk -> colors
[06:24:52] <Krinkle> https://www.npmjs.org/package/colors
[06:24:57] <Krinkle> this one also modifies string proto
[06:25:31] <kswedberg> Krinkle: ah, didn't know about switch to colors.js. hmm. 
[06:26:20] <Krinkle> I recall some vague stuff about how bash colors are quite hacky and not always compatible. Maybe there's a color type that is compatible with another type to start a color, but not uncolor? I'd expect it to either work or not work, not to only work to start a color and but not support the end color code.
[06:28:16] <kswedberg> I'm probably out of my depth here. I was replying based on a vague recollection. And, yeah, I'd expect the same.
[06:31:26] <kswedberg> Krinkle: actually, could be that I was thinking of yeoman (https://github.com/yeoman/yo/blob/master/package.json), not grunt. sorry for my non-help. 
[06:31:37] <Krinkle> no worries, thx

[07:57:52] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: The job didn't handle submodule changes very well.
[07:58:08] <Krinkle> and git in general doesn't handle it very well, not sure how I'll deploy it
[07:58:27] <Krinkle> needs git-clean to remove the old, and git submodule update --init after checkout to add the new
[07:58:47] <Krinkle> we should have a staging for testswarm :P
