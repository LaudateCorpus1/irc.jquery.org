[04:46:47] <MSK> I used superfish menus for project, In that I need when i mouseout from the submenus ,the submenus are keep on show
[05:25:45] <gibson042> .
[06:38:18] <sindresorhus> DaveMethvin:  Maybe remove this page: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Autocomplete ? Since it's depricated, and a part of jQuery UI now.
[06:38:49] <DaveMethvin> yep, good idea
[06:41:50] <sindresorhus> DaveMethvin:  You'll have to do it, I don't have access ;)
[06:41:59] <DaveMethvin> check out the page now sindresorhus
[06:42:51] <sindresorhus> DaveMethvin:  That works. Thanks ;)
[06:43:07] <DaveMethvin> i can wipe the page entirely if needed but let's see if that does the trick
[06:47:11] <sindresorhus> DaveMethvin: That might be a good idea. The problem is that users search for "jquery autocomplete" and get this as the first result, above the jQuery UI plugin, hence a lot of tickets about it.
[07:06:43] <sindresorhus> DaveMethvin:  Would be useful to add the page to disallow in robots.txt too, too make sure it isn't indexed and above the jQuery UI result on Google.
[07:07:43] <DaveMethvin> now that it's a pointer page it shoudl disappear relatively soon, and it does point to the right place
[10:03:02] <paul_irish> rwaldron: including IE8 ? i didnt think that was part of it
[10:05:19] <rwaldron> sorry, that wasn't really the point. I just threw that in there to satisfy those that might say "jQuery will need to support IE8"
[10:05:22] <rwaldron> not married to it
[10:05:33] <rwaldron> and honestly, I dont give a fucking fuck about IE8
[10:05:37] <rwaldron> :)
[11:58:57] * gf3 tells Microsoft on rwaldron

[16:02:02] <ajpiano> maybe i should dial back the spam filter aggressiveness and see if it doesn't result in an an uptick in *actual* spam?
[16:04:26] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: was it dialed up recently? We were getting quite a bit of spam about a month back
[16:04:36] <ajpiano> i dialed it up right after that
[16:04:47] <ajpiano> then i dialed it back to where it was before that like 1 or 2 weeks ago
[16:05:08] <ajpiano> so now it would be taking it down to lower than it's been since we've been like, staying on top of trac
[16:05:29] <DaveMethvin> that's fine
[16:05:37] <DaveMethvin> i did a bunch of cleanup about two weeks ago
[16:05:38] <ajpiano> when i got here, the "points" you had to have to beat the filter was 10, then 15, currently it's 10
[16:05:54] <DaveMethvin> there were posts from waaaay back that were spam that nobody had caught
[16:06:10] <ajpiano> yikes
[16:06:29] <DaveMethvin> i noticed that my gmail spam filters were blocking some of them so i had to allow everything from the bugs domain
[16:20:14] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: so take it down a bit more?
[16:20:22] <DaveMethvin> sure let's give it a try
[16:20:39] <DaveMethvin> i get all the emails ajpiano so i'll know if you took it down too far
[16:20:52] <ajpiano> twss
[16:20:59] <ajpiano> me too
[16:21:03] <DaveMethvin> haha
[16:21:47] <ajpiano> put the karma down to 5
[16:21:50] <ajpiano> we'll see what happens
[16:22:47] <mikesherov> .
[16:23:00] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: thanks for starting that discussion
[16:23:25] <DaveMethvin> sure mikesherov, although i am starting to regret the time it's taking ... i'm writing another reply now :D
[16:23:30] <mikesherov> Glad you're thinking about the best way forward
[16:23:59] <mikesherov> I'm cool with whatever the team deicdes, but I'm squarely on the "break stuff" team
[16:26:51] <mikesherov_> .
[16:46:57] <mikesherov_> I'm JSHinting my companies javascript files for the first time today
[16:47:00] <mikesherov_> 147 files
