[06:51:09] <scott_gonzalez> "img[usemap=#mymap]" is a valid selector, right?
[06:53:47] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I guess not.
[06:54:03] <leobalter> http://jsbin.com/dovex/1/edit 
[06:54:14] <leobalter> it works, and it looks valid
[06:54:43] <leobalter> not intended to work?
[06:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> It fails with git.

[06:55:59] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently all old versions of Sizzle were lax about the quoting requirement in this case.
[06:56:55] <arschmitz> yeah i thought that had to be quoted 
[06:58:35] <leobalter> that might break a lot. I used this kind of selector (with #something) in my former job
[07:02:03] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/10399ddcf8a239acc27bdec9231b996b178224d3
[07:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: That seems unrelated.
[07:03:07] <m_gol> ah, sorry, wrong one
[07:03:52] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: this one: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/commit/f204a6112216f31685717d9fc1bf6cabf42b2ef1
[07:06:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, tracking down another change as well right now.
[07:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: So this is pretty funny. The first commit you linked to is the one that's causing the other failures for me.
[07:14:39] <m_gol> :D
[07:15:16] <m_gol> not that surprising, though, considering that I automatically linked to one of the most major breaks in the upcoming version withouth thinking too much ;)
[07:15:35] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[07:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> Easy enough to fix on my end.

[08:45:58] <Krinkle> Ugh, that's a bit verbose. Notifications for labels now?
[08:50:06] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Yup, now it's: Can be one of ‚Äúassigned‚Äù, ‚Äúunassigned‚Äù, ‚Äúlabeled‚Äù, ‚Äúunlabeled‚Äù, ‚Äúopened‚Äù, ‚Äúclosed‚Äù, or ‚Äúreopened‚Äù, or ‚Äúsynchronize‚Äù.
[08:52:37] <JamesMGreene> :-\
[08:53:01] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: synchronize?
[08:53:07] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[08:53:13] <JamesMGreene> But it doesn't even display the label? :-\
[08:53:18] <Krinkle> Where did you see that
[08:53:39] <Krinkle> (there can be multiple label changes btw, it seems to back off a few seconds)
[08:53:55] <scott_gonzalez> https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pullrequestevent
[08:54:02] <Krinkle> right
[08:54:49] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, maybe synchronize is when you push new commits?
[08:56:29] <leobalter> Krinkle jzaefferer JamesMGreene: meeting today or wrong week?
[08:56:30] <Krinkle> document.head.appendChild( script ).parentNode.removeChild( script );
[08:56:32] <Krinkle> interesting
[08:56:39] <Krinkle> almost like chaining
[08:56:47] <Krinkle> people rarely use return values of DOM methods
[08:56:48] <Krinkle> nice
[08:58:33] <jzaefferer> leobalter: right week, but I missed it and your notification here
[08:58:36] <devnill> does anyone know how the $.ajax crossDomain parameter is set? I'm having trouble finding it in the source
[09:02:22] <Krinkle> devnill: if ( s.crossDomain == null ) {
[09:02:32] <Krinkle> It uses ajaxLocParts
[09:02:57] <JamesMGreene> devnill: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/c869a1ef8a031342e817a2c063179a787ff57239/src/ajax.js#L511
[09:04:54] <markelog> jzaefferer: hey, when new version of qunit will be published?
[09:05:22] <markelog> thought this change ‚Äì https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/26622e74d934f102550490cb24b2b5ed03ca7cd0
[09:05:33] <markelog> would already be available
[09:05:37] <markelog> ?
[09:06:40] <jzaefferer> markelog: soon!
[09:07:19] <devnill> thanks JamesMGreene!
[09:07:24] <JamesMGreene> np
[09:07:48] <devnill> I'm 90% sure i found a bug in jquery 2.x
[09:08:28] <devnill> i'm working on an embedded system which uses webkit to render the UI and .ajax fails silently without firirng the error callback
[09:08:43] <devnill> (it fires in 1 however)
[09:09:33] <devnill> Its a pretty extreme edge case though because it has to do with proxies on systems that don't need to obey the same origin policy 
[09:14:52] <JamesMGreene> Do you know what the WebKit version is?
[09:15:06] <JamesMGreene> jQuery core 2.x drops some support for older WebKit issues, IIRC
[09:15:24] <devnill> It's highly customized, but it is in fact older
[09:15:59] <devnill> The requests work when I manually set crossDomain, but I don't think there is a way to force the default, right?
[12:36:37] <m_gol> JamesMGreene devnill: at least for now, jQuery 2.x has the same browser support as 1.x with the only exception of IE<9
