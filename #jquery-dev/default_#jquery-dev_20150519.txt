[08:21:49] <gibson042> you know, they seemed pretty harmless at the time
[08:21:54] <gibson042> thanks for being our alpha testers :)
[08:22:02] <arschmitz> gibson042: dont they all :-)
[08:22:28] <arschmitz> gibson042: yeah testing against git catches this stuff pretty early at least
[08:24:19] <arschmitz> gibson042: im not even going to really try to argue that the current behavior does not make more sense, but there comes a point where if a method is too much of a PITA to use because of adding so many extra guards we kinda lose the "write less do more" approach
[08:24:45] <gibson042> I agree
[08:24:49] <arschmitz> gibson042: and to me the change for hidden elements is that

[08:57:46] <arschmitz> not sure how recently core updated
[08:57:50] <arschmitz> the jscs version

[09:02:50] <gnarf> okay commitplease is annoying me
[09:02:54] <gnarf> getting in the way of my workflow
[09:02:58] <gnarf> cc jzaefferer 
[09:03:27] <m_gol> gnarf: what does it do to annoy you?
[09:03:38] <gnarf> stop me from commiting
[09:04:28] <gnarf> tho at least it works with --fixup commits
[09:04:44] <gnarf> I leave a lot of "WIP" commits around when i move between branches
[09:05:01] <gnarf> git commit -nm WIP <-- hate having to add the -n
[09:05:20] <gibson042> gnarf: I think commitplease exempts "[WIP]" commits
[09:05:40] <gnarf> gibson042: well whatever I typed that time it stopped me
[09:05:43] <gnarf> and i got annoyed :)
[09:05:50] * gnarf hates auto-enforced hooks
[09:06:14] <gibson042> I get it
[09:06:50] <gibson042> yeah, square brackets exempt validation: https://github.com/jzaefferer/commitplease/commit/39475c806ad1933af15caf53b9e6c8fbad055439
[09:07:20] <gnarf> okay, square brackets
[09:07:36] <gnarf> anyone else working on updating to latest jscs?
[09:07:42] <gnarf> I'm tired of this tool not complaining
[09:10:09] <gibson042> not that I know of at the moment
[09:18:29] <m_gol> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2326/files#r30616698
[09:19:41] <gnarf> hrm
[09:19:51] <gnarf> so i'm like 25% of the way through converting to new jscs
[09:20:15] <gnarf> m_gol
[09:20:33] <m_gol> gnarf: well, talk to markelog :)
[09:20:59] <gnarf> happy to do the same thing to whatever branches I need to
[09:29:49] <gnarf> markelog__??
[09:30:02] <markelog__> gnarf: mm?
[09:30:11] <gnarf> ^^^^ ?
[09:30:25] <gnarf> I'm updating jscs on master right now
[09:30:32] <gnarf> is there another branch I should also do?
[09:30:44] <gnarf> not having the style checkers actually checking our style is being an annoyance for me
[09:30:45] <gnarf> :)
[09:31:11] <markelog__> we decided to update jscs after 3.0 release - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2056
[09:31:19] <m_gol> gnarf: compat
[09:31:33] <m_gol> gnarf: that's where jQuery Compat lives now (the continuation of 1.x)
[09:31:37] <markelog__> otherwise i would already done it
[09:31:59] <gnarf> markelog__: okay well - it's making working on a PR right now annoying
[09:32:02] <gnarf> why would we wait?
[09:32:13] <gnarf> annoying unless you've trained yourself to be jscs
[09:32:15] <gnarf> :)
[09:32:15] <markelog__> since there would be a looot of changes
[09:32:27] <gnarf> markelog__: I'm arlready like 40% through manual fixing
[09:32:36] <gnarf> It's not that drifty
[09:32:42] <markelog__> after jscs -x?
[09:32:45] <gnarf> though we do need a minor update to the build scripts to add some \s's
[09:32:52] <gnarf> markelog__: i didn't know there was an autofix
[09:32:55] <gnarf> i'm just doing it manually
[09:32:56] <markelog__> ))
[09:33:11] <markelog__> try it :-), just try it )
[09:33:33] <gnarf> can i turn it on in the gruntfile?
[09:33:44] <markelog__> we didn't discuss this
[09:34:09] <markelog__> might be weird for the contirbutors to see their code changing without their approval
[09:34:49] <gnarf> problem with jscs -x
[09:34:50] <gnarf> it requires a list of files
[09:34:54] <gnarf> and that list is in the gruntfile
[09:35:07] <markelog__> you can enable it the grunt plugin
[09:35:09] <markelog__> if you update it
[09:35:13] <markelog__> "fix" option
[09:36:14] <markelog__> but in any case, i would wait until 3.0 release, since with "jscs -x" those changes are very easy and wouldn't cloud new changes or affect pending PRs
[09:36:48] <markelog> gnarf: gotta go
[09:42:49] <gnarf> alrighty - setup sublime jscs autoformatter
[09:42:57] <gnarf> makes this much easier
[09:45:00] <arthurvr> I agree that it makes sense to handle all the code style things after v3.0
[09:45:05] <arthurvr>  though I also agree it’s currently a really irritating situation :/
[09:46:19] <arthurvr> jscs -x is pretty amazing by the way
[11:02:30] <gnarf> hrm
[11:02:42] <gnarf> hitting a bit of a blocker with testing one of my hook points because I don't expose it
[11:03:15] <gnarf> tweeners and animationPrefilters -- i could set one up
[11:03:20] <gnarf> but it would have to be "global" in the suite
[11:03:24] <gnarf> and thats kind of annoying
[11:03:51] <gnarf> thinking about exposing it off of the .Animation constructor 
[11:04:03] <gnarf> for test suitness
[11:04:20] <gnarf> thoughts cc gibson042 ?
[11:06:32] <gibson042> as in, `Animation.prefilters instanceof Array` rather than `typeof Animation.prefilters === "function"`
[11:06:41] <gibson042> ?
[11:06:54] <gibson042> I could see that
[11:08:25] <gnarf> Animation.prefilter = function() {} (to help you push)
[11:08:32] <gnarf> Animation.prefilters = array
[11:09:05] <gnarf> tweener() -- tweeners object
[11:09:24] <gibson042> yeah
[11:09:26] <gnarf> I think it brings size up a little bit
[11:09:48] <gibson042> we have Animation.prefilter now, and it looks like it hides too much
[11:09:49] <gnarf> assuming we want people to be able to jQuery.Animation.prefilters = [];
[11:09:55] <gibson042> right
[11:11:27] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/225bde37c997f5ddd9fe00fdfb8e9a43545cfbbc did something similar, exposing the HTML prefilter function for consumer override
[11:12:48] <gibson042> I think we're at the point where we trust users, which makes methods like Animation.prefilter unnecessary
[11:23:09] <gnarf> tweener is still useful
[11:23:16] <gnarf> because it does some format shifting
[11:23:32] <gnarf> for like multiple property lists
[11:23:38] <gnarf> and making sure each property is an array before pushing
[11:23:45] <gibson042> I agree
[11:27:46] <gibson042> `props = props.split(" ")` should probably be `props = props.match( rnotwhite ) || []`, though
[11:29:44] <gnarf> agree
[11:30:00] <gnarf> I could make that change and add some tests
[11:30:09] <gnarf> as long as I'm here ™
[11:30:12] <gibson042> :)
[11:30:15] <gnarf> 🎉
[11:30:31] <gnarf> btw - https://github.com/gnarf/osx-compose-key
[11:30:37] <gnarf> got bored
[11:30:38] <gnarf> :)
[11:31:28] <gnarf> so many random things I can remember how to type now https://github.com/gnarf/osx-compose-key/blob/master/DefaultKeyBinding.dict
[11:32:26] <gibson042> that's pretty cool
[11:34:16] <gibson042> I haven't thought to extend my keybindings, but they're complete enough for stuff I need occasionally: —, –, ï, è, →, Å, ², ±, etc.
[11:34:50] <gibson042> the emoji are a nice touch, though
[11:40:44] <gnarf> yeah
