[02:55:09] <qFox> hi. what do you guys use for code test coverage?
[02:55:20] <qFox> the swarm doesnt seem to mention code coverage
[02:57:18] <jzaefferer> there's jscoverage: http://siliconforks.com/jscoverage/
[02:59:43] <qFox> yeah, but what is jquery using?
[02:59:59] <qFox> i've been through the google and SO stuff. the number of options are limited
[03:00:26] <qFox> which is ok for me personally, i wanted to spend some time "there" anyways ;) but for now, i need something for development
[03:01:35] <qFox> (there are a few firebug extensions, the recently released bunker and something embedded in the js testdriver project. that's about where it ended for me)
[03:05:06] <qFox> jzaefferer, or did you mean you guys are using jscoverage for jquery?
[03:07:03] <jzaefferer> don't think core team is checking code coverage, jQuery UI certainly doesn't right now
[03:08:37] <qFox> hm, interesting by itself. but okay, thanks :)
[06:06:38] <jaubourg> hello :)
[06:22:50] <timmywil> hi jaubourg !
[06:22:58] <timmywil> can anyone add 1.6.3 as a milestone?
[06:23:12] <timmywil> ajpiano, danheberden, JohnResig
[06:32:05] <kswedberg> danheberden: can you please check on api.jquery.com ? appears to be down. :(
[07:10:23] <danheberden> ?down api.jquery.com
[07:10:26] <bot-t> danheberden, It's just you. - http://api.jquery.com is up.
[07:10:45] <danheberden> timmywil to the bug tracker?
[07:10:45] <kswedberg> thx for checking. was down before. now up.
[07:10:53] <danheberden> kswedberg it's being finicky
[07:10:55] <kswedberg> danheberden: did you do anything?
[07:11:01] <danheberden> no, just awoke
[07:11:05] <kswedberg> ...to fix it?
[07:11:11] <kswedberg> ah ok.
[07:11:23] <danheberden> i'll take a peek into the box here in a sec
[07:11:33] <kswedberg> danheberden: cool, thx.
[07:12:37] <danheberden> timmywil added
[07:14:28] <danheberden> JohnResig should the 1.5.2 open blockers report be consolidated into 1.5 and any remaining blockers be placed in a 1.6.3 open blockers report? (also create a 1.5 fixed tickets )
[08:33:31] <louisremi> hey timmywil, which browser return "auto" in you jsfiddle for PR 408?
[08:34:32] <louisremi> and did you see my comment on #7641? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7641#comment:10
[08:35:32] <jaubourg> does anybody have a vmware image onto which I could test for IE6?
[08:35:44] <jaubourg> tired of microsoft's stupid virtual pc
[08:35:47] <louisremi> timmywil: (nevermind about "which browser", I realized I was doing something wrong)
[08:35:54] <jaubourg> and hi guys
[08:36:02] <louisremi> hi jaubourg
[08:36:52] <jaubourg> hey louisremi :)
[08:36:54] <jaubourg> sup?
[08:37:12] <ben_alman> http://twitter.com/cowboy/status/93343572018999296
[08:37:14] <socialhapy> http://bit.ly/pz4x3H @cowboy: I had to set a reminder to replace smoke detector batteries and came across this http://bit.ly/o6xAA5 #jquery
[08:37:22] <jaubourg> just saw that ben ;)
[08:37:55] <louisremi> jaubourg: Just coming back from MountainView where I was for a work-week. Internship at Mozilla is awesome!
[08:38:58] <jaubourg> hehe
[08:39:12] <louisremi> what about you?
[08:39:14] <jaubourg> you got to their offices there? We passed by them with rick & ben
[08:39:24] <jaubourg> got a nice FF4 poster
[08:39:27] <jaubourg> ;)
[08:39:46] <louisremi> Yeah I know. There are many mozillians with Bocoup stickers on their laptops
[08:39:51] <jaubourg> working on ajaxHooks, usejs and node-plus... too much work
[08:40:07] <jaubourg> THE PLAN WORKED! BOCOUP IS EVERYWHERE!
[08:40:31] <louisremi> what are usejs and node-plus? gotta checkout on github!
[08:40:36] <ben_alman> wat
[08:40:46] <ben_alman> well that visit paid off
[08:40:50] <ben_alman> AND i got a t-shirt too
[08:41:04] <ben_alman> er i mean sweet knit polo shirt
[08:41:15] <jaubourg> oh yeah, got a t-shirt too :)
[08:42:29] <jaubourg> louisremi: usejs I'm completely redesigning right now, node-plus is an utility library we need at Creative-Area for our own projects with array methods available on array-like objects (and plain objects when it makes sense), deferreds and means to transform callback-based functions into deferred-enabled ones
[08:44:07] <louisremi> alright, I'm going to keep it at the back of my mind
[08:49:13] <louisremi> timmywil: yt?
[08:49:40] <timmywil> louisremi: hey man, currently busy
[08:50:15] <louisremi> alright, np, I know you'll look at that bug comment anyway ;-)
[08:50:31] <timmywil> louisremi: yea i saw. that's not a bad argument
[08:50:57] <timmywil> so i may be swayed
[08:52:03] <louisremi> Oh, now I'll have to lookup "swayed" on the Internet to understand your sentiment about my comment
[08:52:15] <jaubourg> flipped?
[08:52:24] <timmywil> haha, turned to the dark side?
[08:52:33] <timmywil> ;)
[08:52:36] <jaubourg> hehe
[08:53:14] <louisremi> ok, got it. thanks guys ;-)
[09:01:58] <rwaldron> ajpiano i have a suspicion you're not catering to my absurd needs and wants
[09:02:26] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:02:40] <ajpiano> having read my own reply though like myself
[09:02:42] <ajpiano> a few hours later
[09:02:47] <ajpiano> i remember kind of thinking it didn't make sense
[09:02:48] <ajpiano> :/
[10:20:51] <louisremi> jaubourg: writing a high level comment of what _mark() and _unmark() do would be highly appreciated
[10:20:53] <louisremi> (and there are coding style issues regarding spacing in _mark)
[10:21:15] <paul_irish> louisremi: i heard i missed you in CA
[10:21:18] <paul_irish> bummmrrr
[10:21:57] <louisremi> paul_irish: yes, that might have been a one in a life-time opportunity!
[10:22:12] <louisremi> paul_irish: kiddin', will see each-others next time :-)
[10:22:21] <paul_irish> :) hopeso
[10:23:05] <louisremi> Google offices are awesome, btw (but you know that already)
[10:24:57] <louisremi> JohnResig: can we open bugs to request comments on certain parts of the code?
[11:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> events shouldn't bubble from elements up to the window, right?
[11:03:25] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/ehoref/edit
[11:15:08] <JohnResig> louisremi: hmm, not sure if that makes sense?
[11:41:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think they stop at document
[11:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I found a ticket for it
[11:44:54] <scott_gonzalez> this bug has existed since 1.6 :-/
[14:22:36] <miketaylr> scott_gonzalez: gnarf: per spec, they stop at document. but in practice in most (if not all browsers) they bubble to window
