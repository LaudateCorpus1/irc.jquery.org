[07:39:42] <DaveMethvin> lol, rwaldron: "No, jQuery core does not use eval ... I said GOOD DAY SIR!"
[07:40:00] <timmywil> hehe
[07:40:41] <rwaldron> dudes...
[07:40:54] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/BrGHv/
[07:41:06] <DaveMethvin> animate/css should support arbitrary math expressions for sure
[07:41:16] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/2926
[07:41:30] <rwaldron> anywaaaaayy
[07:41:36] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin wat?
[07:42:07] <DaveMethvin> uh, ~ is a css selector so yeah
[07:42:47] <timmywil> was there someone complaining about ~ not working in IDs?
[07:43:32] <DaveMethvin> above i was just commenting on that pr to add Mathematica to css and animate expressions rwaldron ... we can do it with eval, yeah!
[07:43:52] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: where did rwaldron find that old ticket?
[07:45:03] <rwaldron> it was just commented on
[07:45:19] <DaveMethvin> oic!
[07:45:35] <timmywil> ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
[07:45:39] <timmywil> now i get it
[07:45:40] <rwaldron> i basically spit in the face of HTML5's "attributes can have any bullshit you want for values" policy
[07:45:47] <DaveMethvin> this is like old forum threads that lie dormant for years
[07:46:25] <DaveMethvin> ok, so whether we put out 1.6.4 rc1 today or not I would like to start landing some stuff soon for 1.7
[07:46:35] <DaveMethvin> maybe the branch is the right way to go
[07:46:51] <rwaldron> best: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10234
[07:47:10] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin do it!
[07:47:10] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yes we can start putting together 1.7 on its own branch
[07:47:24] <rwaldron> timmywil DaveMethvin protip: land chronologically <3
[07:47:31] <timmywil> let's go ahead and get rc out
[07:47:36] <rwaldron> yay
[07:47:47] <rwaldron> thats a solid idea
[07:47:57] <DaveMethvin> fortunately my stuff is isolated to event atm, although i have a few others to do but was gonna wait until the main part landed
[07:48:02] <rwaldron> will give the more active testers a nice weekend project
[07:48:43] <DaveMethvin> the good thing about an rc is that we don't need to notify everyone and have them update the cdns
[07:48:53] <timmywil> yerp
[07:49:13] <timmywil> except ours
[07:49:21] <DaveMethvin> right and release.js does that
[07:49:26] <timmywil> cool
[07:49:26] <DaveMethvin> if it runs ok :P
[07:49:36] <DaveMethvin> which I will know soon
[07:49:40] <timmywil> 1.6.4rc1 then back to 1.6.4pre btw
[07:50:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah those are the two things I have to type, lemme see if I can type them right
[07:51:05] <DaveMethvin> i'll get out the cheat sheet here ...
[07:55:26] <kborchers> anyone from mobile here? no one answering in #jquerymobile
[07:55:48] <DaveMethvin> kborchers: they are your best hope
[07:56:53] <kborchers> yeah, no one around and wondering if anything happened with the pageshow event from beta2 and the beta3 just released as none of my pageshow handlers work when i upgrade
[07:56:56] <kborchers> oh well
[07:57:14] <DaveMethvin> timmywil, rwaldron: how does this look? (before I push to jquery) https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/commits/master
[07:57:41] <timmywil> perfect!
[07:57:57] <DaveMethvin> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.4rc1.js is there as well
[07:58:06] <DaveMethvin> i love it when a script comes together
[07:59:25] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/A0qHvQ
[07:59:25] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Tagging the 1.6.4rc1 release. - Dave Methvin
[07:59:25] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Updating the source version to 1.6.4pre - Dave Methvin
[07:59:38] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: are you using the script to do the release?
[07:59:44] <DaveMethvin> yep, worked perfectly
[08:00:10] <JohnResig> cool :)
[08:05:54] <DaveMethvin> blog post: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/09/09/jquery-1-6-4-rc1-released/
[08:08:03] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: nice work
[08:08:21] <DaveMethvin> ok, "1.6.4rc1" added to the bug tracker as well
[08:08:44] <DaveMethvin> it's all over but the tweetin i think
[08:09:54] <rwaldron> looks awesome to me
[08:09:58] <DaveMethvin> who's got access to the jquery twitter acct? ajpiano?
[08:10:10] <ajpiano> yessir
[08:10:15] <rwaldron> <3 ajpiano
[08:10:21] <DaveMethvin> yes we do
[08:10:28] <rwaldron> wooo!
[08:10:34] <DaveMethvin> can you tweet the 1.6.4rc1 ajpiano
[08:10:35] <rwaldron> i dominate the 1.6.4 release
[08:10:45] <rwaldron> (sadly, I caused it too)
[08:10:47] <rwaldron> :P
[08:10:49] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron you dominated 1.6.3 and 4
[08:10:58] <DaveMethvin> you gotta break eggs to make mayonnaise
[08:11:24] <rwaldron> mayonnaise is delicious
[08:11:32] <DaveMethvin> especially on bacon
[08:11:51] <DaveMethvin> a perfect melange of saturated and unsaturated fats
[08:12:02] <rwaldron> i might have a cholesterol problem on deck
[08:12:08] <rwaldron> :D
[08:12:19] <rwaldron> So, we are released?
[08:12:25] <rwaldron> BRANCH 1.7!
[08:12:27] <DaveMethvin> well our candidate is
[08:12:35] <rwaldron> orite
[08:14:44] <DaveMethvin> ok i Google+ it (damn that's hard to verbify)
[08:15:49] <sean`> plus it
[08:16:22] <DaveMethvin> "i incremented it on Google" is too long
[08:16:58] <ajpiano> "I used the Google Plus social networking service to share the link with my selected circles!"
[08:17:11] <DaveMethvin> quite proper mr piano
[08:17:25] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin g+'ed?
[08:17:27] <rwaldron> +G
[08:17:33] <rwaldron> ^^^
[08:17:40] <rwaldron> it's like +1
[08:17:48] <rwaldron> but it's +G
[08:17:57] <rwaldron> even though you say it "Google Plus"
[08:18:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah but you can't add a past-tense verb ending to it :)
[08:18:09] <rwaldron> "I plus G'ed it"
[08:18:14] <DaveMethvin> maybe i'll just say i Plussed it
[08:18:19] <rwaldron> that works
[08:18:39] <DaveMethvin> does that make me a Plussy?
[08:18:54] <rwaldron> weird
[08:19:57] <sean`> lol
[08:51:20] <addyosmani> ?9941
[08:51:22] <bot-t> [#9941]  (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/9941
[08:51:29] <addyosmani> thoughts on whether we should attempt to normalize?.
[08:55:31] <rwaldron> I've got a line into the guys working on mobile
[08:59:47] <addyosmani> cool rwaldron
[09:00:08] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Just unboxed a n950 Meego phone today (thanks Nokia!). Slick OS and jQuery Mobile looks fantastic on it. ★ http://bit.ly/omdReO
[09:11:14] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I just chatted with the jQuery Mobile dudes and I've decided that docs#9941 should be fixed for 1.7
[09:11:16] <bot-t> [#9941]  (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/9941
[09:12:05] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: i assume that call is coming from jQuery.removeEvent?
[09:12:18] <rwaldron> document.removeEventListener( orig, handler, true );
[09:12:27] <rwaldron> if handler is undefined, exception is thrown
[09:12:27] <DaveMethvin> right and where is that in our code?
[09:12:32] <rwaldron> in removeEvent
[09:12:34] <rwaldron> i believe
[09:12:52] <DaveMethvin> not sure how handler is undefined ...
[09:12:57] <rwaldron> I just assigned it to me, but now that I think about it, I should assign it to you...?
[09:13:03] <rwaldron> dunno
[09:13:18] <DaveMethvin> would be good to check if 1.7 already fixes it, there have been a lot of changes
[09:15:56] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: it's gotta be the removeEvent in cleanData but again i am not sure how handle could be undefined there...it would be really good to see a test case
[09:16:25] <rwaldron> its all in the ticket
[09:16:51] <DaveMethvin> oh i missed the link!
[09:18:10] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: that just shows that it can throw an exception though, not how handler would be undefined in a real program
[09:18:57] <rwaldron> right...
[09:19:12] <DaveMethvin> somehow there is a non-special-event attached to an element yet there is no handler for that element in jQuery
[09:19:15] <rwaldron> but i as thinking a simple check to make sure handler was not undefined
[09:19:20] <DaveMethvin> that shouldn't ever happen afaik
[09:19:48] <DaveMethvin> you could have a *special* event and no handler attached but that's not the case
[09:20:10] <DaveMethvin> so that's why I'd like to know what is going on there and why a test case would help
[09:20:51] <DaveMethvin> if we could get his code and run in elsewhere, maybe we could use a debugger to see what is happening
[13:19:04] <rwaldron> timmywil ya know... that dude wasnt talking about input elements...
[13:19:15] <rwaldron> he was talking about friggin DIVs
[13:19:18] <rwaldron> *barf*
[13:19:41] <rwaldron> shockingly, `value` is a valid attribute of div
[13:19:42] <rwaldron> :\
[13:27:24] <timmywil> rwaldron: and it will retrieve the attribute value on a div
[13:27:42] <timmywil> because the property will always be empty string unless set with js
[13:27:50] <timmywil> empty string or undefined that is
[13:27:53] <timmywil> depending on the browser
[13:28:11] <timmywil> cause value is not a valid property on a div
[13:30:00] <rwaldron> oic
[13:30:10] <rwaldron> ><
[13:30:14] <timmywil> i didn't think it was a valid attribute either, but it still gets it for you
[13:30:27] <rwaldron> i looked it up in the spec
[13:30:50] <timmywil> you have a link?
[13:32:10] <timmywil> I'm looking at this page, but it's only talking about properties http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/index/attributes.html
[13:32:41] <timmywil> well, the whole page is a mixture, i mean value properties
[13:33:34] <timmywil> you know what, I read that wrong, they are attributes
[13:33:38] <timmywil> are you sure it's valid on a div?
[13:34:00] <rwaldron> At this moment, I seem to have been mistaken
[13:34:09] <rwaldron> i thought i had looked this same thing up recentlu
[13:34:11] <rwaldron> recently
[13:35:34] <rwaldron> I'm a total dummy
[13:35:44] <rwaldron> i just remembered what I am thinking of
[13:36:10] <rwaldron> i recently looked up infoz about using value="" with <button> vs <button>whatever</button
[13:36:13] <rwaldron> SORRY
[13:36:41] <timmywil> ah right
[13:37:21] <timmywil> yea, it's even valid on li's, but deprecated
[13:49:19] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: jQuery Mobile Beta 3 is now available on the Microsoft CDN - http://t.co/N706jvf ★ http://bit.ly/qgJTHv
[13:54:31] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: looks like jaubourg has a coupla branches already in jquery for his 1.7 stuff
[13:54:47] <timmywil> yup i know
[13:54:51] <DaveMethvin> i guess we shoudl create a new branch for landing everything?
[13:55:00] <timmywil> yea
[13:55:13] <timmywil> one of those branches is mine actually
[13:55:18] <timmywil> his is Callbacks
[13:55:23] <DaveMethvin> ok
[13:55:43] <timmywil> would you like me to merge them together?
[13:55:53] <DaveMethvin> sure, i was gonna say i have to run off soon
[13:56:01] <timmywil> kk
[13:56:02] <DaveMethvin> i have mine rebased to 1.6.4pre
[13:56:12] <DaveMethvin> so i will land them either tonight or tomorrow morning
[13:56:15] <timmywil> yea, that will be the fun part, hopefully not too bad
[13:56:31] <timmywil> i might ask jaubourg to rebase his own branch actually
[13:56:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah :)
[13:56:55] <DaveMethvin> always fun to do the rebase, it usually gets all my spacing wrong
[13:57:01] <DaveMethvin> and i don't notice until about 5 commits later
[14:01:20] <timmywil> ?tell jaubourg it's time! please rebase 1.7/Callbacks on the current master and resolve your conflicts. please.
[14:01:21] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[18:50:23] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yt?
[18:52:28] <DaveMethvin> ?tell timmywil Do you know why https://github.com/jquery/jquery/branches shows master last updated in july?
[18:52:28] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, Okay.
