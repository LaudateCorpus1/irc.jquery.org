[07:01:05] <timmywil> gibson042: ping
[07:10:16] <gibson042> yo timmywil
[07:10:54] <timmywil> gibson042: hey, what are your thoughts on tracking bower dependencies? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1452
[07:11:42] <timmywil> this doesn't track the whole bower_components folder, mind you
[07:12:26] <gibson042> honestly, I haven't followed along closely enough to form an opinion
[07:14:02] <timmywil> I'd like to merge this today so I can continue working on integrating our new release script. If you didn't object to that (fellow Sizzle updater), I was going to go ahead and merge.
[07:14:13] <gibson042> but I like control over the placement of dependencies
[07:17:50] <timmywil> Basically, when you want to update the new Sizzle, update the bower.json version, run `grunt bower`, then commit.
[07:30:31] <gibson042> nothing stands out as objectionable
[07:30:52] <timmywil> cool, thanks for looking
[08:02:52] <Krinkle> Hi
[08:03:11] <Krinkle> rxaviers: 
[08:03:20] <rxaviers> Hello
[08:04:44] <Krinkle> Is Iskren joining us?
[11:04:21] <jqcommit> [13testswarm] 15maherbeg closed issue #288: 'wiperun' action not distributing test re-runs to browsers 02http://git.io/mrhAUw
[14:23:00] <eddiemonge> why does http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.map 404 but other paths without the trailing slash redirect?
[14:37:33] <m_gol> eddiemonge: haha, good question! :D
[14:53:06] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: "It seems like Timo isâ€”or should beâ€”friends with Scott GonzÃ¡lez. With this in mind, it's worth noting that Scott is more of a CSS aficionado. There is also an obvious connection between Timo and JÃ¶rn Zaefferer, MZMcBride, James M. Greene, and gnarf37."
[14:53:10] <Krinkle> http://osrc.dfm.io/krinkle
[14:53:11] <Krinkle> hehe
[14:53:21] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHAHAHA
[14:53:23] <Krinkle> Spot on, each of those names is correct (MZMcBride is a wikimedian)
[14:53:30] <scott_gonzalez> CSS aficionado is not something I would call myself.
[14:53:46] <Krinkle> also "nine-to-fiver who works best late at night (around 10 pm)", perfect
[14:54:07] <Krinkle> eventhough things done late at night I usually push at different times, I guess it looked at the commit time
[14:54:11] <Krinkle> or author time even
[14:54:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm a champion JavaScripter.
[14:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> I love pushing code. Right into my veins. It feels so good.
[14:56:15] <Krinkle> http://osrc.dfm.io/scottgonzalez#schedule
[14:56:18] <Krinkle> tuesday tinker
[14:56:39] <Krinkle> wow, I find that hard to believe. Did you maybe run a bot script once on a tuesday?
[14:56:47] <Krinkle> There's a huge spike on tuesday
[14:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, nope, no bots.
[14:58:28] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa, that Tuesday spike is ridiculous.
[14:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> That can't be right.
[14:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub doesn't do punch cards for users, do they?
[14:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> Just for repos, right?
[15:01:33] <Krinkle> Indeed, they gathered the data manually.
[15:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: The Tuesday thing may actually be real.
[15:24:46] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: You just slack off the rest of the week :P
[15:24:55] <Krinkle> and then don't sleep for 24 hours on tuesday?
[15:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> Well, look at https://github.com/scottgonzalez#calendar-graph
[15:25:27] <scott_gonzalez> The Tuesday row is definitely darker.
[15:26:03] <Krinkle> 3rd row, right?
[15:26:44] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[15:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think the graph with the huge spike was right though.
[17:21:40] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: arschmitz figured out what my massive Tuesday spike is.
[17:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> I made up a game called The GitHub Game.
[17:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> And I pushed thousands of commits from a bot.
[17:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> HAHA: http://osrc.dfm.io/scottgonzalez/the-github-game
[17:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know who that Phil guy is. Maybe he forked it?
[17:23:38] <scott_gonzalez> http://osrc.dfm.io/scottgonzalez/the-github-game.json
[17:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> ~10k commits
[17:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/2b3F0K1r1W0F
[17:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> The contribution graph was interesting, actually.
[17:25:12] <scott_gonzalez> In the beginning everything started fading to yellow.
[17:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> Because that day's count was getting massive.
[17:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> But at some point it hit a threshold and then everything went back to normal. Like it knew that it was a statistical anomoly and should be ignored.
[17:31:46] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: private repo?
[17:32:00] <arschmitz> Krinkle: deleted
[17:32:03] <Krinkle> k
[17:32:09] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: probably starred it
[17:32:16] <arschmitz> Krinkle: yeah he did
[17:32:22] <Krinkle> I noticed earlier that somehow starring makes you a contributor according to this site
[17:32:32] <arschmitz> but he deleted it because then it remoes the commits from his stats
[17:32:32] <Krinkle> very confusing when I saw other people contributed to my dotfiles.git repo
[17:32:36] <Krinkle> which I never had a pull request or issue on
[17:32:59] <Krinkle> http://osrc.dfm.io/Krinkle/dotfiles
[17:33:00] <arschmitz> ( i was on a call with him waiting for tests to run when he made that repo lol )
[17:33:46] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: cool
[17:34:00] <Krinkle> What was the repo about? Or was the game itself making lots of commits?
[17:34:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it was fun.
[17:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> That was the game.
[17:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> The repo had a history of 1 commit.
[17:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> And there were no files.
[17:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> But I had 10k commits :-P
[17:34:27] <Krinkle> force pushes?
[17:34:29] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[17:34:32] <Krinkle> lol
[17:34:35] <scott_gonzalez> git commit --amend --allow-empty
[17:34:37] <scott_gonzalez> git push -f
[17:34:39] <scott_gonzalez> repeat
[17:34:49] <arschmitz> did it with a node script
[17:35:57] <arschmitz> pretty awesome
