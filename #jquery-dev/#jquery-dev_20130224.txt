[13:49:10] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yt?
[13:49:23] <DaveMethvin> yep mikesherov
[13:49:33] <mikesherov> Just saying hi. I'm back
[13:49:43] <DaveMethvin> welcome back!
[13:49:51] <mikesherov> Had to focus on the business for a few weeks
[13:50:06] <DaveMethvin> i could just see you wearing a Cupid outfit
[13:50:12] <mikesherov> HAHA
[13:50:16] <DaveMethvin> especially the arrow and diaper
[13:50:28] <mikesherov> the diaper is protection from reading the bug tracker
[13:50:41] <DaveMethvin> i've needed that a coupla times
[13:50:50] <snover> DaveMethvin: tests!
[13:50:57] <mikesherov> Looking forward to Toronto
[13:51:01] <DaveMethvin> there are a couple of new bugs that could use your tender touch mikesherov
[13:51:05] <mikesherov> tests! You said it snover 
[13:51:11] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: care to share?
[13:51:13] <mikesherov> cc me?
[13:51:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:52:33] <mikesherov> I don't see any open tixx with me as cc'ed
[13:52:37] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13453  http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13457
[13:52:51] <DaveMethvin> just looking at them now
[13:53:10] <mikesherov> hoo boy
[13:53:29] <mikesherov> OK, I'm just going to assign them all to myself
[13:53:39] <mikesherov> even if I am not going to work on them immediately
[13:53:42] <DaveMethvin> wow, let me get a bigger list :D
[13:53:49] <mikesherov> I'm gearing up for late night Toronto
[13:53:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah that will be fun
[13:54:05] <mikesherov> So MUCH THINGS
[13:54:16] <mikesherov> UI: effects rewrite, interactions rewrite
[13:54:21] <mikesherov> Infra: mergeatron
[13:54:27] <mikesherov> Core: this nonsense
[13:54:30] <snover> teststack!
[13:54:42] <mikesherov> Org: work with Mike West to tackle Webkit issues
[13:54:59] <DaveMethvin> we need FEWER tests snover, they keep failing
[13:55:07] <snover> -mergeatron +teststack
[13:55:26] <snover> well at least you can get coverage information so you know where you are overtesting :))
[13:56:13] <mikesherov> snover: what's teststack?
[13:56:22] <mikesherov> We just released mergatron 1.0 to NPM
[13:56:39] <snover> https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-teststack
[13:56:47] <DaveMethvin> what's teststack? some ci framework, it's supposed to be good for you
[13:56:55] <DaveMethvin> i'm not gonna try it, get mikey to try it
[13:57:06] <DaveMethvin> he likes it! hey mikey!
[13:57:13] <snover> aww, come on dave
[13:57:27] <DaveMethvin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgB25WBeBxA
[13:57:35] <mikesherov> so, mergeatron ~= travis
[13:57:46] <mikesherov> seems like we're talking about different things snover
[13:58:06] <mikesherov> but hey, I'll try anything
[13:58:14] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:58:18] <snover> teststack works with travis
[13:58:41] <snover> travis + sauce labs + teststack = distributed continuous integration with code coverage analysis
[13:58:54] <snover> and real events
[13:59:15] <mikesherov> sure, I use saucelabs as well
[13:59:41] <mikesherov> and mergeatron, and then a bunch of stuff: QUnit, selenium, etc.
[13:59:52] <mikesherov> real events are yummy
[14:00:01] <mikesherov> selenium drivers do all that
[14:01:00] <mikesherov> arg
[14:01:06] <snover> so in the last two weeks you have stopped using browserstack and testswarm?
[14:01:26] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13453 looks like when we screwed with :visible, we forgot about input type=hidden
[14:01:35] <mikesherov> snover: me personally?
[14:01:45] <snover> no, i am talking about jquery core
[14:01:48] <snover> and jquery ui
[14:01:50] <snover> and all the things
[14:01:52] <mikesherov> oh, no
[14:02:18] <mikesherov> I'm personally a huge fan of saucelabs
[14:02:39] <mikesherov> I was talking about for me
[14:03:07] <DaveMethvin> if it was more reliable to use saucelabs over browserstack i'd be for it, assuming they'll give us a decent enough setup
[14:03:20] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13453 looks like when we screwed with :visible for 1.9, we forgot about input type=hidden
[14:03:22] <snover> they have free oss accounts.
[14:03:41] <mikesherov> saucelabs also can run selenium scripts
[14:03:47] <mikesherov> which is sweet
[14:03:54] <mikesherov> get that real events goodness
[14:04:04] <snover> â€¦
[14:04:05] <DaveMethvin> right so we can use qunit but migrate to selenium/webdriver if we want
[14:04:06] <mikesherov> be able to write functional tests that units can't cover
[14:05:27] <snover> did you read the features list?
[14:09:59] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: can't repro http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13453
[14:14:26] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: 2 no repros
[14:14:34] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13457
[14:16:12] <DaveMethvin> oh mikesherov on 13457 that's an invalid doctype!
[14:16:17] <DaveMethvin> probably in quirks
[14:16:21] <DaveMethvin> duh
[14:16:53] <mikesherov> geez
[14:17:01] <mikesherov> even with invalid doctype it worked
[15:53:37] <kswedberg> ////////..
[17:01:20] <kswedberg> sorry, that was a 3-year-old â†‘
[17:03:40] <snover> happy birthday kswedberg
[17:03:56] <snover> three whole years, wow
[17:04:00] <snover> youâ€™re growing up so fast
