[09:28:50] <timmywil> jzaefferer: QUnit needs version tracking
[09:29:42] <timmywil> jzaefferer: Dave and I ran into a situation where we wanted to compare versions of QUnit and looked for the version number on the QUnit object and in the source
[09:30:17] <rwaldron> +1
[09:30:21] <rwaldron> so does Sizzle
[09:30:26] <jzaefferer> timmywil: there's no good argument against starting to version it, so I guess its about time
[09:31:03] <rwaldron> :)
[09:31:07] <rwaldron> progress!
[09:31:33] <jzaefferer> could start tagging 0.9 now and have an 1.0 once most (blocker) issues are fixed
[09:31:43] <jzaefferer> or 0.1
[09:31:44] <jzaefferer> whatever
[09:32:10] <timmywil> 0.9 is fine. it's already used like it's passed 1.0
[09:32:22] <jzaefferer> so far the question "when is QUnit starting to get versioned", not "it needs a version!"
[09:32:27] <jzaefferer> *+was
[09:32:53] <jzaefferer> where should QUnit releases be announced?
[09:33:17] <jzaefferer> I don't want separate blogs or twitter accounts...
[09:33:27] <timmywil> jquery's twitter is fine
[09:33:40] <timmywil> if you want to post something, jquery blog
[09:33:44] <jzaefferer> ok
[09:34:01] <jzaefferer> that'll help promote it :-)
[09:34:05] <timmywil> yea
[09:34:56] <timmywil> JohnResig: I don't actually know the state of versions on Sizzle
[09:40:20] <jzaefferer> timmywil rwaldron gnarf: do you have a script for doing git-releases? update version in src files, commit that, tag that commit, change version to next-pre thing, commit that...
[09:40:49] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: yes, it's in the jquery/build dir
[09:41:04] <jzaefferer> oh hai DaveMethvin
[09:41:08] <DaveMethvin> release.js
[09:41:08] <jzaefferer> thanks, will take a look
[09:41:38] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: can we get that into npm?
[09:41:43] <DaveMethvin> sure
[09:41:50] <jzaefferer> 3
[09:41:51] <jzaefferer> 2
[09:41:51] <jzaefferer> 1
[09:41:52] <jzaefferer> go!
[09:42:38] <jzaefferer> the makeFinal stuff seems to be very specific to jquery
[09:43:18] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[09:43:25] <DaveMethvin> not generic enough
[10:01:56] <eddiemonge> anyone got server access to bugs.jquery.com?
[10:03:46] <ajpiano> danheberden: ^^
[10:05:44] <eddiemonge> thats around. its the only server that requires a password and i forgot mine :(
[10:06:31] <danheberden> eddiemonge wats up?
[10:06:58] <eddiemonge> danheberden: can you reset my password on bugs? or set it up like every other server with the ssh and what not?
[10:07:21] <danheberden> eventually, ya - is there something pressing that needs attention right now?
[10:07:49] <eddiemonge> no, was just going to grab the theme files and get rolling on some minor styling changes to make it easier to use
[10:11:16] <danheberden> eddiemonge we're in team meetings all day so can't really get in there right now, but lets make sure to talk in the next day or two, k?

[16:30:59] <mikesherov> hey guys, I'm currently working on my pull request: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/528
[16:31:00] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (1d, 1h ago): make sure box-sizing:border-box children of a hidden div report inner/outer/Width()/Height() correctly, fixes #10413
[16:32:04] <mikesherov> I'm at the point where I'm testing for box-sizing: border-box
[16:32:41] <mikesherov> and I know how to test for all vendor prefixes, but I'm trying to think of the most performant way
[16:33:03] <mikesherov> there is the standard that is actually set out in: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.cssHooks/
[16:33:23] <mikesherov> I guess I have two questions:
[16:33:43] <mikesherov> 1. what is the most performant way to test for CSS3 style properties?
[16:34:45] <mikesherov> 2. Is the scope of my ticket overkill? I.E. Would the performance hit needed to look up the box-sizing value outweigh the utility of fixing this bug?
