[08:10:06] <danheberden> so apparently as soon as I added something to log what IP the captcha gets, it's no longer firing it on bugs.jquery.com :/
[08:10:22] <danheberden> or, rather, no one has tried to make a bug anonymously and i couldn't get it to show for me
[08:10:32] <ajpiano> want me to try
[08:10:37] <danheberden> sure?
[08:10:51] <danheberden> maybe you try making the ticket, gimme the # and i'll try commenting
[08:10:58] <danheberden> so it gets 2 ip's in an hour
[08:11:03] <ajpiano> kk
[08:16:20] <ajpiano> danheberden: def got bounced for spam
[08:16:25] <ajpiano> now filling out captcha
[08:16:30] <danheberden> cool
[08:16:37] <ajpiano> and then captcha'd
[08:16:46] <ajpiano> and then it just rejected it as spam, maximum # posts per hour etc
[08:16:53] <ajpiano> now i feel how our users do
[08:16:53] <ajpiano> :|
[08:16:57] <danheberden> wtf - why does python not want to log
[08:17:12] <ajpiano> save the rainforest?
[08:17:18] <danheberden> lol
[08:17:22] <danheberden> WHY DO I NOT KNOW PYTHON
[08:26:04] <Mithaldu> ajpiano: good to see some understanding :)
[09:40:34] <danheberden> if you're thinking to yourself "self, the bugs server is running even worse than normal" - i'm beating the hell out of it, so stay tuned
[10:26:49] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: april 9 sounds great
