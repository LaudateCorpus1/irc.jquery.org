[07:28:55] <rwaldron> danheberden ^
[07:31:01] <danheberden> rwaldron oh! yeah, whoever makes a stable release (jÃ¶rn) needs to upload it to the cdn
[07:31:06] <danheberden> do you want me to?
[07:31:12] <danheberden> or need it on the cdn?

[09:15:20] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: You didn't update the jshint rules for QUnit, did you? Like onevar?
[09:30:19] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: Getting a bunch of errors when adding onevar: true, even though you probably fixed a lot of those already
[09:30:41] <rwaldron> jzaefferer nope
[09:30:53] <rwaldron> none at all
[09:31:16] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: When I add `onevar: true`, I get a bunch of errors
[09:31:21] <rwaldron> cool
[09:31:24] <jzaefferer> Even though you probably got rid of a lot of them already
[09:31:26] <rwaldron> I can add it on this side
[09:31:29] <rwaldron> and fix them all
[09:31:36] <rwaldron> and push those fixes
[09:31:46] <jzaefferer> k, thanks
[09:31:55] <rwaldron> yesterday we agreed to make jquery 1.8 completely onevar friendly
[09:32:00] <rwaldron> so, +1
[09:36:18] <mikesherov> oh, wow, that's big news
[09:37:27] <mikesherov> rwaldron: should I be going through my stuff and onevar'ing it now? I just want to make sure I'm not duplicating work
[09:41:53] <rwaldron> mikesherov naw
[09:42:01] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez and I hatched a plan
[09:42:13] <rwaldron> he and I will tackle ui and core respectively
[09:42:28] <rwaldron> and just sweep the whole of each library at once
[09:42:37] <rwaldron> but, i guess...
[09:42:44] <rwaldron> yeah, make my life easier ;)
[09:42:51] <rwaldron> haha
[09:44:41] <mikesherov> ok, no problem
[09:45:39] <rwaldron> jzaefferer all set, onevar support is is pushed
[09:46:00] <rwaldron> so mikesherov, sorry if i was unclear, i definitely would like you to write everything as onevar
[09:46:31] <mikesherov> ok, will do Rick
[09:46:48] <mikesherov> I'm in css.js right now, so I'll cover that file
[09:46:54] <rwaldron> woo!

[10:18:08] <rwaldron> jzaefferer not yet, but I see no reason why we shouldn't explore it
[10:19:38] <jzaefferer> more a question of actually doing it
[10:19:41] <Krinkle> 20 minutes?

[10:53:22] <Krinkle> you're welcome
[10:53:38] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: We're < 20 issues on jquery/testswarm now

[10:57:00] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: was the jenkins plugin updated ?
[10:59:57] <mikesherov> gnarf: I can't change the vendor prefix stuff yet to return a falsey value, it breaks some stuff in the current events.js file
[11:00:18] <mikesherov> gnarf: and I'm not sure how to fix it
[11:01:02] <gnarf> mikesherov: thats a weird place to have something break...
[11:01:09] <gnarf> mikesherov: do you have that work on a branch?
[11:01:20] <gnarf> perhaps one of us can dig in
[11:01:45] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ^^^ events --- cssProps dependency?
[11:01:50] <mikesherov> My change is literally changing changing the last return in vendorPropName to "" instead of origName
[11:03:02] <gnarf> seems strange for it to break events for any reason
[11:03:11] <gnarf> but I haven't looked at that code in a really long time
[11:03:24] <mikesherov> excuse me
[11:03:29] <gnarf> effects?
[11:03:31] <mikesherov> brain fart... I meant effects
[11:03:34] <mikesherov> Yeah
[11:03:36] <gnarf> okay
[11:03:38] <mikesherov> sorry about that
[11:03:50] <gnarf> what units were failing?
[11:04:04] <mikesherov> ?filter=css in oldIE
[11:04:08] <bot-t> mikesherov, 03/02/2012 - Timeline – jQuery Core - Bug Tracker - http://bugs.jquery.com/timeline?from=2012-03-08T15:06:28Z&precision=second

[11:05:12] <gnarf> mikesherov: If you don't hear me say anything about it by like next week - remind me please - but I should have some time to look at it...  Super busy this weekend with servers stuff
[11:05:22] <mikesherov> OK
[11:05:23] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: no jenkins update, no, seems like its not all broken...
[11:05:32] <Krinkle> yeah
[11:05:39] <Krinkle> maybe because qunit only has one module
[11:06:39] <jzaefferer> as for https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/78 - I can work on that, but that shouldn't block the 1.0.0 milestone
[11:06:40] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #78 on testswarm (jzaefferer; 8m, 1w ago): Deal with non-stop browser releases (Chrome, Firefox)
[11:14:38] <rwaldron> Krinkle ha... I made 4 passes
[11:14:48] <rwaldron> thanks for catching those
[11:14:52] <Krinkle> np
[11:16:05] <rwaldron> QUnit looks very nice
[11:16:14] <mikesherov> gnarf: No need to respond, but I don't think that change is safe. I think it actually causes me to have to right more code in css.js for things to be performant in oldIE. When you're finishing with everything else, we can try tackling that change, but the effort doesn't seem to be worth the outcome
[11:16:14] <rwaldron> *to look at
[11:17:23] <Krinkle> rwaldron: TestSwarm is also getting prettier
[11:17:35] <Krinkle> rwaldron: http://i.imgur.com/82an1.png
[11:18:29] <Krinkle> latest master looks even better (slight edits) but the major overhaul is visible in that shot already
[11:22:12] <mikesherov> sindresorhus_: thanks for contributing to pulley :-)
[11:22:40] <sindresorhus_> mikesherov:  Sure, I find it very useful :D
[11:22:56] <mikesherov> You're actually using it? Cool.
[11:23:02] <sindresorhus_> mikesherov: I hate the dirty commit logs we get by using the default GitHub merge button, when there are like 20 commits
[11:23:32] <mikesherov> yeah, me too. It's an artifact of trying to represent a DAG as a straight line
[11:23:41] <sindresorhus_> mikesherov:  I actually just started using it today: https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/commit/912053358867cd1859e02993cb60ee95b86ff1b2
[11:23:41] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on todomvc by sindresorhus (43m, 59s ago): Landing pull request 132. Knockout.js updates for the new template and changes based on the Idiomatic style guide Fixes #????.  More Details:  - https://github.com/addyosmani/todomvc/pull/132
[11:23:58] <mikesherov> cool
[11:24:09] <mikesherov> the Fixes #???? needs to be fixed.
[11:24:12] <Krinkle> oww, mysterious ?? commit
[11:24:40] <mikesherov> pulley always assumes a ticket number will be in the commit message somewhere
[11:25:02] <mikesherov> stupidly
[11:25:10] <sindresorhus_> mikesherov:  I was going to submit a ticket on that
[11:25:21] <mikesherov> please do
[11:25:37] <mikesherov> You're the first real world user besides myself
[11:25:53] <mikesherov> I bashed it together to do what I needed, and that's what's currrently live there
[11:25:58] <mikesherov> I need more input
[11:28:03] <sindresorhus_> You should promote it more, it's very useful :)
[11:29:40] <mikesherov> I'm relying on word of mouth. If a retweet from JohnResig didn't promote it enough already, it just needs to be more useful before it catches on.
[11:29:41] <rwaldron> Krinkle definitely much nicer to look at
[11:30:01] <rwaldron> (i was actually talking about qunit's code, but either way, this is way nicer)
[11:30:10] <rwaldron> bootstrap ftw
[11:30:20] <Krinkle> I know you were talking about qunit's code
[11:30:30] <Krinkle> TestSwarm's code has also been rewritten to be nice to look at :)
[11:30:41] <Krinkle> but yeah, its visual is also nicer with bootstrap
[11:31:12] <Krinkle> I also added a fair amount of navigation in the interface (list of projects, link to project from job page, and more.. )
[11:32:21] <rwaldron> mikesherov you should reconstruct pulley repo and use grunt for linting/testing/maintenance ;)
[11:33:08] <mikesherov> Yeah, I am definitely going to be using grunt
[11:33:10] <sindresorhus_> +1 on grunt
[11:33:22] <mikesherov> Adding an issue for that
[11:33:25] <rwaldron> I'm looking through your work here, great fixes guys
[11:34:12] <rwaldron> mikesherov I would be interested to see a "mock" github api for testing
[11:34:43] <rwaldron> I recently learned a rad trick for mocking
[11:35:01] <rwaldron> it was a serialport interface
[11:35:13] <mikesherov> oh, for node-duino?
[11:35:19] <rwaldron> that really only needed to sp.emit([ octals ])
[11:35:28] <rwaldron> i'm no longer using node-duino
[11:35:58] <rwaldron> i dont like that it requires hand coded C++ protocol in a file that has to be compiled and uploaded to the board
[11:36:18] <rwaldron> I'm porting all of the modules I wrote to a new library that sites atop node-firmata
[11:36:25] <mikesherov> Cool
[11:36:48] <rwaldron> which is a JS api built specifically to take advantage of the built in Firmata protocol
[11:37:04] <rwaldron> that is actually meant for other language to interface with the microcontroller
[11:37:13] <rwaldron> so, no C++ needs to be written
[11:37:29] <rwaldron> also... node-firmata is written by a contributor to arduino firmata :)
[11:37:30] <mikesherov> yeah, in regards to mocking the github API: only roadblock is that I'd need a whole separate set of tests just to test the mock object.
[11:37:44] <mikesherov> I'm intrigued by arduino
[11:37:55] <rwaldron> mikesherov did i just hear you whisper "challenge accepted"?
[11:38:01] <mikesherov> You said it best: I want to use javascript to launch missiles
[11:38:05] <rwaldron> just use the tests that the github api ship?
[11:38:15] <mikesherov> Oh, github has a suite of tests?
[11:38:18] <rwaldron> HELL YEAH
[11:38:23] <rwaldron> dunno
[11:38:41] <rwaldron> perhaps there is a nice package already written
[11:38:46] <rwaldron> with tests and shit
[11:38:47] <mikesherov> to google!
[11:38:52] <rwaldron> that you can switch to?
[11:38:57] <rwaldron> just brainjamming
[11:39:39] <mikesherov> yeah, I hate searching for "github" on google
[11:39:49] <mikesherov> it just returns me a list of github projects
[11:40:02] <mikesherov> "github mock object" returns github projects about mock objects
[11:41:18] <mikesherov> and the truth is that most of the stuff that breaks is in actual pushes as opposed to the github API
[11:41:28] <mikesherov> but git isn't something that needs to be mocked really.
[11:41:40] <mikesherov> can use a real local repo for that
[11:42:00] <mikesherov> hmm, good brainjam
[11:43:14] <sindresorhus_> Is it really worth it to mock it when we can just test against the real thing?
[11:44:06] <mikesherov> yeah, I just added an issue that says: "test or mock"
[11:44:14] <mikesherov> whichever gives us best results.
[11:44:52] <mikesherov> We can always have the test harness fork the test repo and set up a new local repo to run unit tests against.
[11:45:02] <mikesherov> and we can use github API to verify the results.
[11:45:16] <sindresorhus_> yup
[11:45:20] <mikesherov> Cool
[11:46:23] <mikesherov> so, in the meantime, until I write the docs, sindresorhus: can you test that PR by cloning mikesherov/pulley-test and verifying it works as expected, and then I'll pulley it in?
[11:48:04] <sindresorhus_> mikesherov: Sure
[11:48:11] <mikesherov> Thanks!
[11:49:30] <sindresorhus_> mikesherov: You need to add something too it though. I can't fork it until you do.
[11:50:05] <mikesherov> K

[11:53:15] <sindresorhus_> mikesherov: You also need to either add me as a collab to the repo or pull in my changes and test it yourself
[11:54:48] <mikesherov> Well, don't you have a fork of the repo?
[11:55:12] <mikesherov> I'll add you as a collab, that's no problem, I just want to understand what the issue is
[11:55:19] <mikesherov> for any other contributor
[11:55:31] <sindresorhus_> I don't think I can submit a pull request to my own fork?
[11:55:59] <mikesherov> Oh...

[12:00:09] <mikesherov> I'm going to add those instructions to the test repo
[12:00:37] <sindresorhus_> Now the --remote would come in handy btw ;)
