[04:34:11] <CasW> Hey guys, with jQuery UI draggable, is it supposed to snap earlier if you have a bigger margin? And leave no margin between the elements?
[05:01:21] <CasW> Okay, I fixed it, but I don't really know how... In $.ui.plugin.add("draggable", "snap" { the function drag at the if(o.snapMode !== "inner") at if(ts) and if(ls) I changed the - inst.margins.top to - 3*inst.margins.top and the bs and rs the - to a +, and in if(o.snapMode !== "outer") I changed the - into a + at if(ts) and if(ls)
[05:02:43] <CasW> And yes, I do still get unexpected results...
[05:11:05] <terrycojones> Is there any plan to change jQuery deferreds to follow the promises/A+ spec?
[05:11:35] <CasW> Okay, if I don't change the if(o.snapMode !== "outer"), then it works as expected
[05:18:29] <CasW> Okay, I'm pretty sure it works as expected now, do you guys want my code? As I think the behavior I got by default was a bug or at least unexpected. I'm using jQuery UI 1.10.3, by the way

[09:55:42] <simba_> im currently working on a javascript library  .I am not an expert javascript programmer. The library is mostly for HTML5 and normal HTML. Im using jquery as the base library , what im doing is creatng adapater module for my library. I wanted to know what is the best way to intergrate jquery into my library
