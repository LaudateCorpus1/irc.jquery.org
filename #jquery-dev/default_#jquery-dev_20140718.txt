[14:25:53] <tbranyen> scott_gonzalez: did you ever get closure from: https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/146 ?
[14:26:03] <tbranyen> as far as i can tell it still doesn't work as wycats describes
[14:44:13] <wycats> Seems bad
[14:44:46] <wycats> \{{}} should work
[14:45:12] <wycats> And the reason we don't support delimiter changes is because we have a compiled lexer :)
[14:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> I honestly don't even remember what I was working on back in 2011.
[14:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> I only vaguely remember creating templates that create templates.
[14:48:11] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't know what it was for, so I can't even check if I ended up using the escape character.
[14:50:01] <tbranyen> scott_gonzalez: ha okay thanks, also wycats \{{name}} didn't work for me, it just didn't parse the property at all and did {{name}} instead of {Tim}
[15:00:51] <wycats> It's supposed to produce {{name}}
[15:00:59] <wycats> You want something different than Scott
[15:01:44] <wycats> I don't even understand by what logic you expect {Tim} o_O
[15:03:46] <tbranyen> wycats: https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/825
[15:03:53] <tbranyen> looks to be answered here
[15:05:48] <wycats> The helper approach seems best to me
[15:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, "\{{name}}" producing "{{name}}" is what I wanted.
