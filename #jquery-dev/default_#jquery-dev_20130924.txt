[06:47:12] <Krinkle> Did something change recently in the minifier configuration we use for jquery core?
[06:47:29] <Krinkle> Looks like it no longer merges var a = []; var b = a.slice; into var a = [], b = a.slice;
[06:47:57] <Krinkle> or maybe that was never enabled, but it is slightly increasing jquery core .min.js because we started to write statements like that
[06:48:00] <Krinkle> why is that?
[06:48:15] <Krinkle> var arr = []; var slice = arr.slice; var concat = arr.concat;
[07:01:10] <gibson042> Krinkle: the multiple var statements are a result of our AMD changes, but I have no idea why they are being merged by minification
[07:01:15] <gibson042> *aren't
[07:01:24] <Krinkle> I do, know

[07:01:30] <b-ot> Krinkle: Oleg (5mon 6d ago): Change uglify compression options, close gh-1245.
[07:01:41] <Krinkle> we explcitily set join_vars=false (the default is true)
[07:01:52] <m_gol> weid
[07:01:53] <Krinkle> traced it back to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1151
[07:01:53] <b-ot> Krinkle: Pull request #1151 by markelog (7mon 3w ago): #13355 - Uglifyjs compression options and variable sequence optimization 
[07:01:55] <m_gol> * weird
[07:02:02] <Krinkle> presumably it would save in gzip
[07:02:33] <Krinkle> Not sure though
[07:02:59] * Krinkle verifies
[07:03:00] <gibson042> I just checked 1.x-master; it's -13 bytes
[07:03:30] <gibson042> in favor of joining
[07:03:45] <Krinkle> that's not what I;m getting
[07:03:55] <markelog>  a lot has changed since that commit
[07:04:31] <markelog> back then join_vars = false has saved some bytes
[07:04:33] <Krinkle> https://dpaste.org/JujV4/
[07:04:48] <markelog> it might be useful to experiment with other properties as well
[07:04:49] <Krinkle> +1 in gzip
[07:05:41] <Krinkle> though -111 in min
[07:05:45] <Krinkle> +1 in min.gz
[07:05:56] <Krinkle> the -111 in min is obvious
[07:07:54] <markelog> it's +1 to master and -13 to 1.x-master
[07:08:39] <markelog> gzip is awesome that way :-)
[07:09:49] * Krinkle tries more optoins
[07:09:55] <Krinkle> I'll submit a PR later
