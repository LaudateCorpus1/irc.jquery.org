[04:28:51] <guy> so I get this buggy behaviour with jquery outerWidth that sometimes return randomly big values like 7265 for a 70px wide object, here is a demo https://dev.anuary.com/e12e6e59-daac-5c27-ade3-b0a1ecfde542/
[04:28:52] <guy> if you look at the logic how <ul> width is calculated, this should never happen http://cl.ly/image/3h0e3m2p0424
[04:29:26] <guy> (Google Chrome)
[07:44:25] <timmywil> haven't run a size check in a while, this is nice to see: http://cl.ly/image/1Y2i421m2F18
[07:46:03] <gibson042> 500+ bytes of that is DaveMethvin ripping through deprecated.js: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/6b14cef7a85d22d979266a754b2a279ecd636b24
[07:46:04] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by Dave Methvin (1d, 15h ago): Remove APIs now in jquery-compat
[07:47:21] <mikesherov> that's 1.6.4 levels
[07:51:22] <timmywil> gibson042: did you perf test the new cache strategy?
[07:51:57] <timmywil> how does it perform?
[07:52:17] <timmywil> if you like it, I'd say feel free to land
[07:53:08] <gibson042> timmywil: I wasn't able to test it in oldIE, but it looked ok everywhere else
[07:53:18] <gibson042> can you check the former?
[07:53:25] <timmywil> gibson042: also, with this strategy, an alternative to Sizzle.removeData would be exposing expando as Sizzle.expando. in jQuery => 'delete elem[ jQuery.find.expando ]`
[07:53:37] <gibson042> my thoughts exactly
[07:54:13] <timmywil> not bad sir
[07:56:12] <timmywil> gibson042: do you have a corporate jQuery browserstack account yet?
[07:57:07] <gibson042> as a matter of fact, I don't
[07:57:10] <timmywil> I have a deadline this weekend so I need to work on that, but we should get you an account if you don't already have one
[07:57:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, danheberden ^^
[07:57:39] <timmywil>  / gnarf
[07:58:26] <gnarf> um
[07:58:28] <gnarf> hrm
[07:58:36] <gnarf> how do we add people to that CC scott_gonzalez?
[07:58:45] <gnarf> do I just email em?
[07:58:51] <gnarf> or who's the contact there
[07:59:16] <gibson042> but https://raw.github.com/gibson042/sizzle/5638f7f6ea2bb32b06ace004d2fcebd5e0da2cac/speed/index.html doesn't work in browserstack IEs :(
[07:59:30] <gibson042> no Java
[07:59:54] <timmywil> you mean the java 7 issue?
[08:00:21] <gibson042> probably, I haven't looked too far into it
[08:00:28] <timmywil> java 7 won't run in mac chrome cause it's 32-bit. you can use safari or revert to java 6 (which is what I did)
[08:00:50] <timmywil> oh you're linux aren't you
[08:01:06] <timmywil> well, it's probably different, but it's something like that
[08:21:27] <paul_irish> sindresorhus: nah didnt make any headway
[08:21:35] <paul_irish> glad to see scott_gonzalez making moves :D
[08:23:02] <sindresorhus> ya, i'm sure it can be useful to a lot of projects, ours included.
[08:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You just tell me and I add people.
[08:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: What email address do you want me to send the invite to?
[08:26:01] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Do you know of anyone that could help me figure out why the Spreadsheet API doesn't work the way I'd expect?
[08:26:29] <paul_irish> i dont know any devrel specifically on docs
[08:26:35] <paul_irish> lemme look around though
[08:26:52] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: which API are you using
[08:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'm using https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds as that's the only thing I've found.
[08:27:41] <paul_irish> oh
[08:27:56] <paul_irish> i think you can still get it as JSON via that
[08:28:05] <paul_irish> and publically if its not a private spreadsheet
[08:29:05] <paul_irish> https://developers.google.com/gdata/samples/spreadsheet_sample
[08:29:22] <paul_irish> but yah. /feeds is the right thing, afaik
[08:30:04] <paul_irish> and i guess you saw http://www.ravelrumba.com/blog/json-google-spreadsheets/
[08:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> I hadn't seen that blog post.
[08:31:32] <scott_gonzalez> I saw that they support alt=json and also jsonp with their crazy name, but it didn't seem to work on private data, which didn't make sense to me.
[08:35:48] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: For private data, there's no way to use the API without a human actually logging in, right?
[08:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> That was the impression I got readin the docs.
[11:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> miketaylr: ping
[11:39:45] <cbarrett1> greetings irc://irc.freenode.com:6667/#jquery, which question about $.get - can you change the responseType to 'arraybuffer'?
[11:39:45] <cbarrett1> Would that be the dataType property?
[11:39:50] <cbarrett1> heh
[11:39:52] <cbarrett1> paste fail
[11:40:10] <cbarrett1> let me try again
[11:40:31] <cbarrett1> I have a question about $.get, can I change the dataType property to 'arraybuffer'?
[12:11:53] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: i believe that is correct.
