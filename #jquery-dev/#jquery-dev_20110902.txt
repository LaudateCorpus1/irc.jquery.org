[02:19:02] <DarsVaeda> Hi, is this a bug? http://jsfiddle.net/dsm3J/ -> jqueryUI 1.8.5 -- http://jsfiddle.net/dsm3J/1/ -> jqueryUI 1.8.16 ; if you drag the "ID19" to the other side you get a perfectly fine array with all elements in jqueryUI 1.8.5 but in jqueryUI 1.8.16 the id from "ID19" is missing
[04:06:19] <addyosmani> hey guys.
[04:07:29] <addyosmani> anyone around? :)
[05:34:34] <addyosmani> Hey DaveMethvin
[05:34:47] <DaveMethvin> hey addyosmani
[05:35:43] <addyosmani> Quick question: so with $.ajax/getJSON etc, do we support the single character form of '/' for urls, or do we require them to be passed as '//'?
[05:36:02] <addyosmani> I wasn't able to find any docs related to this and http://jsfiddle.net/GEJwe/ seems to confirm '/' doesn't work, but '//' does
[05:36:06] <DaveMethvin> i wondered if that was a problem with caching
[05:36:29] <DaveMethvin> if you do the equivalent ajax but use cache:false does it make a requeset?
[05:36:46] <addyosmani> lemme check
[05:39:22] <addyosmani> http://jsfiddle.net/Ga9sB/
[05:39:52] <addyosmani> if that's correct, it appears to work with '/' when cache:false is set and gets a cors exception with '//'
[05:40:01] <DaveMethvin> which does seem right
[05:40:20] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure why getJSON doesn't specify cache:false
[05:40:51] <addyosmani> good question
[05:41:02] <DaveMethvin> i think it must be returning 204 not modified, lemme look
[05:41:14] <addyosmani> mmk.
[05:41:29] <addyosmani> I've got to head for a meeting, but let me know if you discover something :) back soon!
[05:41:37] <DaveMethvin> k thanks!
[07:01:21] <addyosmani> hey DaveMethvin
[07:01:24] <addyosmani> any luck? :)
[07:01:25] <DaveMethvin> hey
[07:02:11] <DaveMethvin> i haven't run through the ajax issue totally but it looked like the ajax code was returning "No transport" which makes no sense to me
[07:02:24] <DaveMethvin> we should get jaubourg to take a look
[07:04:58] <addyosmani> definitely
[07:05:08] <addyosmani> I'll ping him when it he's around again
[07:05:25] <addyosmani> Thanks for preliminarily looking into it :)
[08:44:57] <DaveMethvin> matjas: I closed your forest of PRs but please do feel free to create a new PR later this month
[08:45:49] <DaveMethvin> also there is no need to create a new PR for updates, just push the changes to the original PR's branch and it will update the PR
[08:47:11] <ajpiano> i hope you can see the forest for the tries
[08:47:14] <ajpiano> bwaha
[08:50:10] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[08:53:00] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I hacked up your data article real good. It's all yours now.
[08:53:22] <DaveMethvin> lol, well i am sure it deserved its fate kswedberg, thanks!
[08:54:13] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: my pleasure. I added a code example for each of the 5 rules of the road. Please look especially closely at those to make sure they make sense and relate to the "rule"
[08:54:46] <DaveMethvin> oh that looks much nicer kswedberg
[08:55:01] <kswedberg> great. thanks. :)
[08:55:07] <DaveMethvin> i'll go through it and make sure it's all good
[08:55:24] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: awesome. then publish whenever you're ready.
[08:55:30] <DaveMethvin> k
[09:39:43] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: posted ... how do I set an avatar?
[09:39:54] <DaveMethvin> i see it in the profile but it doesn't seem to take a url there
[09:40:28] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: bbiam
[09:40:34] <DaveMethvin> np
[10:23:49] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: fixed it. sorry about that. the avatar field is optional, btw. it'll grab an img from gravatar.com if the field is empty.
[10:25:11] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[10:46:45] <gnarf-web> DaveMethvin: you around?
[10:51:09] <gnarf-web> DaveMethvin: was just curious if you were still planning on posting something about raf as well
[10:51:40] <DaveMethvin> gnarf-web: sure, i can post something but i wasn't quite sure where we stood on that
[10:52:41] <DaveMethvin> after thinking about it i wondered if we should come to some decision on 1.7 or 1.8 and then wrap that up in a blog post
[10:52:52] <DaveMethvin> that explained why we took it out and how we are going to put it back
[10:53:12] <DaveMethvin> i still believe in putting it back :)
[10:53:35] <DaveMethvin> so the blog post will explain what ppl need to do to ensure their code works properly
[10:54:04] <DaveMethvin> i am hoping the one i just did on data will put all those redundant tickets to rest so maybe that will be the test case
[10:55:12] <kswedberg> speaking of which … everyone should tweet the link to that post so we can help get the word out: http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[10:55:50] <DaveMethvin> i tweeted it and i saw a G+ by elijah manor
[10:55:56] <timmywil> kswedberg: I tweeted it so that's like….3 more people that will see it.
[10:56:13] <DaveMethvin> lol
[10:56:24] <DaveMethvin> you're popular with US and that's what counts
[10:56:29] <kswedberg> timmywil: awesome! we can add that to my 5.
[10:56:29] <gnarf-web> I think that we can be pretty sure it won't appear again in the 1.7 release cycle
[10:56:41] <timmywil> kswedberg: cool
[10:56:44] <gnarf-web> but I'll bid in on a animation restructure in 1.8 :)
[10:56:57] <timmywil> ajpiano: maybe jquery could tweet it
[10:57:13] <DaveMethvin> gnarf-web: ANIMATION RESTRUCTURE NO RESERVE L@@K
[10:57:14] <ajpiano> MAYBE
[10:57:32] <DaveMethvin> i don't think there will be a lot of bidding on THAT one

[11:37:12] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[11:37:16] <rwaldron> that bug is bogus
[11:37:18] <DaveMethvin> yep
[11:37:18] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/99eQ8/1/
[11:37:25] <rwaldron> i DID fix that
[11:37:33] <rwaldron> the OP used 1.6.2
[11:38:01] <DaveMethvin> reverse the two
[11:38:04] <DaveMethvin> do the camel one first
[11:38:54] <rwaldron> how the fucking fuck.
[11:38:59] <rwaldron> gs;rektngdksbg iuesbhrgsehrgiusehrgilvuknjeshr,kfjawlenfjhcqeiuwfhqo4rtyw3876t8q3v7y4cr[9qiupnfoquhwfo
[11:39:04] <DaveMethvin> it's the regexp that changes camel back to dashes
[11:39:41] <ajpiano> lol rwaldron i was wondering what that "keyboard mash" sound i just heard was
[11:40:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's a pisser b/c we just shipped 1.6.3 and i just wrote a big-ass post about .data
[11:40:35] <rwaldron> i'm so sorry
[11:40:43] <rwaldron> i fucked this up
[11:40:45] <DaveMethvin> not your fault
[11:40:49] <rwaldron> it is
[11:40:54] <rwaldron> i should've written better tests
[11:41:12] <DaveMethvin> lol wait until my event stuff lands in 1.7, THEN you'll see bugs
[11:41:52] <DaveMethvin> really don't beat yourself up on it
[11:43:28] <rwaldron> wtf. why is version.txt in conflict?
[11:43:43] <DaveMethvin> see that is prolly my fault right there
[11:44:19] <DaveMethvin> i had to manually fix the failed run of release.js
[11:48:56] <rwaldron> shit
[11:49:01] <rwaldron> my master is broken
[11:49:22] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin timmywil how would I get my master back on track?
[11:49:26] <paul_irish> pull -f  ?
[11:50:05] <rwaldron> i tried
[11:50:09] <rwaldron> hm
[11:50:13] <rwaldron> maybe now that I'm out of conflict
[11:50:17] <rwaldron> i'll try again
[11:50:28] <rwaldron> eff.
[11:50:32] <rwaldron> already up-to-date
[11:50:43] <DaveMethvin> so what's broken?
[11:51:13] <rwaldron> well, i now have an extra commit on my master
[11:51:25] <rwaldron> the commit made when i resolved the conflict
[11:51:29] <DaveMethvin> oh the resolve for version.txt
[11:51:33] <rwaldron> yeah
[11:52:28] <DaveMethvin> i don't think i shoudl be giving out git advice, i get mine from timmywil
[11:54:33] <rwaldron> i'm going to try github.app
[11:54:43] <rwaldron> maybe it is smart enough to sort this ut for me
[11:58:27] <rwaldron> yay
[11:58:28] <rwaldron> git reset --hard HEAD^1
[11:58:49] <timmywil> rwaldron: there are a few ways.  I've just checked out another branch and did git branch -f master upstream/master
[11:59:12] <rwaldron> yeah thats what I'm doing now
[12:01:46] <rwaldron> well.. here's hoping this is all set.

[12:30:53] <timmywil> haha
[12:30:58] <kswedberg> oh sorry i forgot. DaveMethvin.
[12:33:12] <DaveMethvin>  there's a convo going on at hacker news too: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2954726
[12:37:45] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin btw... the reason I pinged you earlier
[12:37:57] <rwaldron> was because data-* attrs have been around since summer of 08
[12:38:01] <rwaldron> just a heads up
[12:38:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah i looked at the html5 spec and it was close
[12:38:17] <DaveMethvin> but i think we won
[12:38:18] <rwaldron> there may be those folks that challenge your claim that jQuery had data() first
[12:38:38] <rwaldron> yeah, i think you're right
[12:38:43] <DaveMethvin> and certainly nobody got serious about them until much later
[12:38:46] <rwaldron> so, clearly you're already aware
[12:38:52] <rwaldron> oh absolutely
[12:40:10] <DaveMethvin> i think the problem we are running into is just a somewhat reasonable expectation that .data() would be the way to mess with HTML5 data- attributes
[12:40:35] <DaveMethvin> and that's just b/c of the name
[12:41:02] <rwaldron> yeah
[12:41:11] <rwaldron> would be nice if that was actually the case
[12:41:24] <rwaldron> like a wrapper for dataset
[12:41:53] <DaveMethvin> but really, once you load the values from the HTML5 attributes there are not that many times when you'd want to go back and change them
[12:42:04] <DaveMethvin> so i think the integration we've done is all we ever should do
[12:42:10] <rwaldron> agreed
[12:42:25] <DaveMethvin> the automagic data type conversion is much more of a problem imo
[12:42:34] <rwaldron> ugh
[12:42:36] <rwaldron> no kidding
[12:42:41] <DaveMethvin> as in "1C4" is a string but "1E4" is a number
[12:43:20] <DaveMethvin> and sure you can use attr to get those values but we just did such a good job explaining how convenient it is that we initialize our data object from the data attributes ... :)
[12:49:02] <kswedberg> rwaldron: heads up … you replied to someone on that hacker news thread, but now the other comment is deleted, so yours is missing context now.
[12:49:50] <rwaldron> hahahaha
[12:57:10] <kswedberg> :)

[13:13:55] <rwaldron> i dont get peope
[13:13:58] <rwaldron> people
[13:13:58] * gnarf nods
[13:13:59] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10195#comment:1
[13:14:03] <gnarf> in the future tho
[13:14:07] <gnarf> u can know
[13:17:02] <gnarf> i do that to myself all the time :)
[13:17:07] <gnarf> accidentally commit on master
[13:17:38] <gnarf> at least git makes it REALLY easy to fix that
[13:19:11] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: dunno why `hover` makes me sad too
[13:19:25] <DaveMethvin> i want to de-document it for 1.7
[13:19:34] <gnarf> like
[13:19:36] <gnarf> seriously
[13:19:45] <DaveMethvin> it seems like such a pita to s/hover/mouseenter mouseleave/
[13:19:46] <rwaldron> yeah, the problem is that it should've been created as a special event
[13:19:52] <rwaldron> but it existed pre-special event
[13:19:53] <gnarf> how hard is .live("mouseenter mouseleave")
[13:20:19] <DaveMethvin> i just think it's a waste b/c it's just a string sub
[13:20:24] <DaveMethvin> there's no semantics to it
[13:20:29] <gnarf> its not really tho
[13:20:36] <gnarf> cuz you have hover( enter, leave ) too
[13:20:37] <gnarf> right?
[13:20:42] <DaveMethvin> and the handler usually wants to know if it's an enter or leave
[13:20:51] <DaveMethvin> oh i meant .live("hover" ..)
[13:20:58] <gnarf> i don't think that works
[13:20:59] <DaveMethvin> but yeah .hover() is a pain too
[13:21:02] <gnarf> :)
[13:21:07] <DaveMethvin> believe it or not gnarf it does
[13:21:15] <DaveMethvin> and it's a feature
[13:21:23] <gnarf> it does? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10195
[13:21:30] <gnarf> oh
[13:21:32] <gnarf> wait
[13:21:33] <gnarf> wtf
[13:21:39] <gnarf> it works on live/delegate but not bind?
[13:21:49] * gnarf laughs
[13:22:02] <gnarf> i totally read that backwards
[13:22:08] * gnarf sides with DaveMethvin
[13:23:45] <DaveMethvin> http://google.com/codesearch#search/&q=live\%28\%22hover\%22&type=cs
[13:24:41] <gnarf> wtf \% ?
[13:25:19] <DaveMethvin> \(
[13:25:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:25:25] <DaveMethvin> kinda strange
[13:25:55] <DaveMethvin> the backslash is for escaping the regexp and the % for escaping the url
[13:26:13] <DaveMethvin> it's a full-on jailbreak if you ask me
[19:58:49] <Krinkle> Awesome! New browsers have a native api for class interaction
[19:59:00] <Krinkle> document.createElement('div').classList
[19:59:03] <Krinkle> http://i.imgur.com/mz6J4.png
[19:59:16] <Krinkle> length, add, remove, contains, even toggle! and mroe
[19:59:18] <Krinkle> more*
[20:00:59] <Krinkle> Any plans for making jQuery use this ?
[20:02:30] <Krinkle> Sounds like something that could be a construction ala .isArray (ie. one feature check and then reference it to native api or utility function for all future calls)
