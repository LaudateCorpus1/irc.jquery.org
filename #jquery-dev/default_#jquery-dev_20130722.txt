[02:57:29] <paul_irish> i want to work with someone on layout thrashing prevention in jQuery...
[02:58:19] <paul_irish> maybe mikesherov and me can make a plan
[02:58:54] <paul_irish> basically all the support checks will hold up a browser for like 10ms.. but it's likely we could improve that by quite a bit.
[03:08:04] <m_gol> paul_irish: a great idea :)
[03:08:30] <m_gol> we should look into support checks for 2.x, I think some of those tests might not be needed at all in this branch
[03:08:59] <m_gol> like the boxSizing test

[09:43:24] <paul_irish> m_gol: ah found it. the trashing is at dom ready. http://gyazo.com/707b78f43ef1fd6e0f00865f3a58c2ca
[09:44:02] <m_gol> paul_irish: yeah, we have some tests run at dom ready
[09:44:38] <DaveMethvin> those are definitely our feature detects
[09:46:08] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: orkel: For updating userAgent registry in testswarm, we need to make sure those browsers are available in browserstack and testswarm-browserstack, and make sure that their useragent is recognized both ways in the ua-parser library.
[09:46:41] <Krinkle> The actual code change (if all the above is OK) is just 1 line in testswarm/localSettings.js in jquery/infrastructure.git
[09:47:04] <Krinkle> But checking all that is a bit of work easily deferred. I'll get on it first thing tomorrow.
[09:47:25] <DaveMethvin> awesome thanks Krinkle!
[09:48:24] <Krinkle> mentioned here since the meeting I reply to is in the log, but I see now that that meeting is still on, so I could've just said it there.
[09:55:11] <orkel> Krinkle: thanks!
[10:00:38] <orkel> timmywil: how about putting "bower install" command to scripts.install in package.json?
[10:01:55] <timmywil> orkel: good idea!
[10:02:34] <orkel> cool, i will submit PR for that :-)
[10:02:45] <timmywil> cool
[10:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> orkel timmywil: package.json is for when you `npm install jquery`, which would be for node use, not client use, right?
[10:32:15] <scott_gonzalez> So `bower install` wouldn't be something you'd do.
[10:33:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this is to get Sizzle, right?
[10:33:07] <scott_gonzalez> Nevermind.
