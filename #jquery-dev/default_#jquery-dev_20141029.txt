[08:33:38] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gibson042 m_gol scott_gonzalez just minor changes from the gdoc you saw ^^
[08:34:20] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: i meant to confirm that google would be okay with two versions of jQuery in the cdn, jquery and jquery-compat
[08:34:32] <DaveMethvin> see preview blog post above ^^
[08:35:15] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: :+1:
[08:35:42] <gibson042> we might want to mention Android in the "support for the widest variety of browsers" list
[08:35:46] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: needs more jokes
[08:36:18] <timmywil> that was a joke...looks good
[08:36:20] <DaveMethvin> oh good point on android ... and the jokes too timmywil 
[08:36:31] <DaveMethvin> nobody will belive i write it

[15:20:54] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Hm.. I recall from our jquery plugins registry discussions that bower is essentially "dead", and that npmjs has indicated willingness aid frontend needs for the future.
[15:21:07] <Krinkle> Do you have some references for me to back that up? Or someone I can ask instead?
[15:21:37] <Krinkle> really liking where the css framework work is going!
[16:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: I have nothing for the Bower side of things, but for npm: https://github.com/npm/npm/issues/4321

[16:56:14] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[16:57:37] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[16:57:52] <m_gol> I submitted this branch dropping older browsers
[16:58:09] <DaveMethvin> ok
[16:58:12] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[16:58:18] <m_gol> which made me change some comments from "sth ancient we don't support" to "Android 2.3"
[16:58:20] <m_gol> I love it
[16:58:26] <DaveMethvin> haha
[16:58:34] <DaveMethvin> sth ancient we do support
[16:58:38] <m_gol> yup
[16:58:49] <m_gol> and I thought I can dump these PhantomJS quirks...
[16:58:58] <m_gol> are we still going for the IE8 baseline for -compat?
[16:59:13] <m_gol> I remember one issue about sth related to filter not working properly
[16:59:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think we can drop ie6/7 now, it's a change from previous blog but i think nobody will complain
[16:59:31] <m_gol> with IE8 I could use -ms-filter which adheres to CSS parsing rules and that would fix it
[16:59:44] <DaveMethvin> oh good!
[16:59:57] <m_gol> ok, I'll wait until the master PR gets merged and then get on to the -compat equivalent
[17:00:08] <DaveMethvin>  ok sounds good
[17:00:54] <m_gol> yeah, this was it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1723
[17:02:05] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: so I'm going to remove those browsers from the periodic run since we're dropping them anyway
[17:02:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah we don't need them now
[17:03:19] <m_gol> we won't see which run uses which branch, though
[17:03:28] <m_gol> at http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryweekly
[17:03:39] <m_gol> because all columns will match
[17:04:09] <m_gol> but maybe that's not so important
[17:04:19] <DaveMethvin> probably not
[17:04:39] <DaveMethvin> also, maybe we'll be dropping some of those in master?
[17:05:08] <DaveMethvin> it depends on what the final browser setup looks like but it's possible we'll push a few into -compat only
[17:05:36] <m_gol> there's not a lot of wiggle-room
[17:05:50] <m_gol> Firefox, Chrome, Opera will be handled in the same way
[17:05:55] <DaveMethvin> agreed, and i haven't thought about it much
[17:06:15] <m_gol> we'll still need to support Android 2.3 in master
[17:06:31] <DaveMethvin> don't remind me
[17:06:38] <m_gol> and besides that there's only IE9 which we've talked about last time
[17:06:40] <m_gol> ;)
[17:06:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[17:06:59] <m_gol> yeah, I've been running a single test suite on Android 2.3 for the past 30 minutes
[17:07:26] <m_gol> it's celebrating every single test...
[17:07:53] <m_gol> we should talk to BrowserStack about their plans for Android 5.0+
[17:08:06] <DaveMethvin> your test should be done by the time it ships
[17:08:12] <m_gol> with auto-updated Web View the current model of versioning by OS doesn't make sense
[17:08:14] <m_gol> hahaha
[17:08:35] <m_gol> we should be able to test last 2 Chromes on Android, regardless the version
[17:08:44] <m_gol> and not Android 5.0 and later 5.1 etc.
[17:09:36] <DaveMethvin> i suspect a lot of carriers and phones won't auto update
[17:09:43] <DaveMethvin> at least in the usa it seems that way
[17:10:19] <m_gol> :(
[17:10:30] <m_gol> will they explicitly break it?
[17:10:37] <m_gol> since it should just work as all other apps
[17:10:57] <m_gol> which can be updated regardless of carriers
[17:11:06] <DaveMethvin>  once they get to android 5.0 i suspect it will work
[17:11:12] <DaveMethvin> but i dunno about existing phones
[17:11:16] <m_gol> yeah, that's what I had in mind
[17:11:23] <m_gol> I fully expect them to screw <5.0 users
[17:11:30] <m_gol> but at least the future is bright
[17:13:02] <DaveMethvin> we're not in the future yet! :)
[17:13:19] <m_gol> shh, don't remind me!
