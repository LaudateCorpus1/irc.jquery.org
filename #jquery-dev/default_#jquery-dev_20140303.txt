[15:05:12] <gnarf> lol
[15:06:29] <gnarf> breaks with -webkit-transform: scale(50%) too
[15:06:40] <gnarf> but like, what are we supposed to do about it?
[15:07:08] <gnarf> definitely not read zoom/transform matrices to translate mouse position, yeah?
[15:15:38] <DaveMethvin> gnarf scott_gonzalez should we escalate this to the browser makers and/or stds groups? It seems really stupid that all these neato new features don't get reflected in the standard apis
[15:24:16] <gnarf> but like, what is the fix for this? :)
[15:31:44] <scottgonzalez> Well, I know transforms get reported in some API, is it gCS?
[15:31:51] <scottgonzalez> Does that handle zoom as well?
[15:43:43] <scottgonzalez> Holy crap this seems overly specific: ".editor .markup.underline.link.hyperlink"
[18:03:47] <rodrigobaron> hi
