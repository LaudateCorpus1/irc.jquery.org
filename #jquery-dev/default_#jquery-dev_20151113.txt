[10:35:05] <m_gol> markelog: so you went to a revert route with 2.2 as well? :)
[10:35:51] <m_gol> not bad! http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1693
[10:35:56] <m_gol> these looks like minor issues

[11:15:12] <mikes000> I am looking to us the .ajexSetup function to modify subsequent requests. The docs say it is strongly recommend against using this API and to define a simple plugin to do so. I have been looking around for some tips on how to do this but havent had much luck, could any one help provide me some direction?

[12:35:50] <m_gol> markelog: I fired up the 2.1.4 test suite on the compilation from 2.2-stable (the version from the previous force-push, before you reverted globalEval changes) and only one test failed in Chrome... looks good! :)
[12:38:25] <m_gol> markelog: the "fractions (see #7730 and #7885)" offset test failed, it returned a non-integer value in Chrome 46
[12:49:20] <markelog> still a long road ahead :0)
[12:50:52] <markelog> m_gol: could you send me a link to the code of the failed test? 
[12:51:47] <m_gol> markelog: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/2.1.4/test/unit/offset.js#L507-L532
[12:52:01] <m_gol> ah, but this is this test that started failing on master in Chrome 46
[12:52:03] <markelog> thanks
[12:52:05] <m_gol> and we workarounded it
[12:52:22] <m_gol> see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/78b9eac1198627eb4dad0cc35334c7704449f310/test/unit/offset.js#L555
[12:52:32] <m_gol> so it seems we just have to backport this workaround
[12:52:42] <m_gol> markelog: re "a long road" - what's left?
[12:52:52] <markelog> oh, okay, so screw that thing then
[12:53:01] <markelog> we need to do the same for 1.x
[12:53:13] <markelog> and someone need to check all the commits
[12:53:24] <markelog> also couple reverts
[12:53:33] <markelog> that need to be looked at
[12:54:19] <markelog> i need to finish with the ff failure, then i will create a ticket with full info in it
[13:00:56] <m_gol> markelog: right, but the fact that tests pass does give me a little confidence
[13:01:04] <m_gol> that you did it right

[14:27:27] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[14:27:45] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[14:27:53] <m_gol> it seems the migrate build is broken?
[14:27:56] <m_gol> http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core/180/console
[14:28:06] <m_gol> most latest commits failed so early they didn't get to TestSwarm
[14:28:34] <m_gol> timmywil: since we no longer commit to compat I disabled compat Jenkins jobs
[14:33:05] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: it seems to have been that way since Oct 23 :-)
[14:34:29] <DaveMethvin> yep
[14:34:45] <DaveMethvin> it's failing the phantomjs tests so it doesn't bother to run the swarm

[14:36:43] <markelog> okay, pushed the fix for the ff
[14:37:17] <markelog> if ff passes, 2.2 should be ready for the review (will create a ticket with details)

[14:40:24] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ok, I thought you didn't know :)
[14:40:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah i didn't know!
[14:40:51] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I'd appreciate quick review of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/pull/121 as it changes Jenkins config as well
[14:40:54] <m_gol> ah, ok :D
[14:41:19] <DaveMethvin> it was "the dog that didn't bark" since it usually puts a status here in irc every week
[14:41:26] <DaveMethvin> and it didn't say it FAILED :)
[14:41:29] <m_gol> haha
[14:46:23] <m_gol> markelog: Opera 12.1x is still failing
[14:46:41] <m_gol> markelog: the rest is just missing support tests results in test/unit/support.js
