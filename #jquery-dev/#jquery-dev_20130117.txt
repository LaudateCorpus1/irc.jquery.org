[14:10:19] <f0ster> why cant status codes be interpretted from responses when using jsonp in ajax ?
[14:19:52] <gnarf> f0ster: because it doesn't use XHR, it uses a <script> tag
[14:20:15] <gnarf> i don't believe there is any way to get the header / result code other than faking a 200
[14:23:48] <f0ster> gnarf: I didnt realize it didnt use XHR.. thanks :)
[14:24:21] <f0ster> what other ways can jquery open a request besides xhr

[15:46:52] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: should grunt-cli be in the package.json for jquery? i thought that was geared towards being a globally installed plugin?
[15:47:21] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: it should not, that is a mistake
[15:48:46] <danheberden> reminds me of when i asked my mom where babies come from. her answer? "mistakes..."
[15:49:06] <DaveMethvin> your mom is very wise
[15:51:18] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: is jQ still 32k?
[15:51:28] <danheberden> apparently building locally with jquery doesn't work
[15:51:39] <danheberden> `node_modules/.bin/grunt`
[15:52:15] <DaveMethvin> it works if you have grunt-cli globally installed
[15:52:26] <DaveMethvin> what's happening?
[15:52:40] * danheberden installs and hopes his existing grunt stuff doesn't esplodezors
[15:52:59] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/2809b.png
[15:53:12] <DaveMethvin> if it finds a global grunt that's not rc4, god save your soul
[15:53:46] <danheberden> how do i install global grunt the new one?
[15:53:54] <danheberden> should i specify a commit?
[15:54:10] <DaveMethvin> the problem is the grunt-based hell we live in atm
[15:54:17] <danheberden> npm install -g grunt#2943060eaa7107fea77f4507437c5f087995eafa ?
[15:54:28] <DaveMethvin> lol, not sure
[15:54:31] <danheberden> haha
[15:54:34] <danheberden> well here goes nothin
[15:54:38] <DaveMethvin> how did we get into this mess?
[15:55:04] <danheberden> oh wait, i don't need global grunt
[15:55:08] <danheberden> with cli
[15:55:21] <DaveMethvin> it should find the right one, yeah
[15:55:48] <danheberden> oh this is reassuring http://danheberden.com/share/a41a4f.png
[15:56:06] <danheberden> i have an idea
[15:56:16] <DaveMethvin> nope definitely  not rc5
[15:56:40] <danheberden> nope, no bueno
[15:56:57] <danheberden> well that is what is installed with `npm install` in jq
[15:56:58] <danheberden> :/
[15:57:00] <DaveMethvin> can you run the grunt in node_modules directly?
[15:57:06] <DaveMethvin> sounds like you tried
[15:57:08] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: that's how this started
[15:57:09] <danheberden> yeah
[15:57:15] <danheberden> i will try installing rc4
[15:57:28] <danheberden> although it seems that task is blowing up
[15:57:30] <danheberden> for some reason
[15:57:57] <DaveMethvin> just to be sure, the package.json specifies grunt rc4 right?
[15:58:38] <danheberden> oh! yeah
[15:58:41] <danheberden> wtf
[15:58:45] <danheberden> it installed fc5
[15:58:48] <danheberden> rc5
[15:58:56] <DaveMethvin> BAD npm bad!
[15:59:03] <danheberden> well https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/tags
[15:59:04] <DaveMethvin> whack it with a newspaper
[15:59:04] <danheberden> is this blank for you too?
[15:59:37] <danheberden> or is it my shitty inet
[15:59:37] <DaveMethvin> ayup
[15:59:45] <danheberden> so there is no rc4 tag
[15:59:47] <danheberden> to find
[16:00:10] <DaveMethvin> oh man
[16:00:11] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: i'll get this worked out
[16:00:18] <DaveMethvin> this town is turning into shit!
[16:00:19] <danheberden> do you want a pr or just a commit?
[16:00:38] <DaveMethvin> um, what were you originally trying to accomplish?
[16:00:47] <danheberden> to build jquery
[16:00:49] <danheberden> using grunt
[16:00:55] <DaveMethvin> dreamer
[16:00:55] <danheberden> keep in mind i'm on 1.9
[16:00:58] <danheberden> i'm trying to build 1.9
[16:01:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah should work
[16:01:02] <danheberden> haha
[16:01:08] <DaveMethvin> lemme just be sure
[16:01:08] <danheberden> you'd think our build process would...
[16:01:11] <danheberden> ... work
[16:01:32] <danheberden> oh wait
[16:01:35] <danheberden> oh fuck
[16:01:40] <danheberden> not only did it not work
[16:01:44] <danheberden> it removed .git
[16:01:45] <danheberden> hahahaha
[16:01:51] <danheberden> it obliterated the repo
[16:01:51] <DaveMethvin> that's bad
[16:01:56] <danheberden> hahahaha
[16:01:57] <danheberden> this is SO ba
[16:01:58] <danheberden> d
[16:02:06] <danheberden> i'm gonna play around with it some more
[16:02:07] <danheberden> hahahaha
[16:02:17] <danheberden> this is gonna be a funny screenshot
[16:02:32] <DaveMethvin> build does work here but i don't have the balz to try a clean npm install
[16:06:56] <danheberden> well, it installed rc4 on origin/master's tip
[16:08:23] <DaveMethvin> just install it on the tip
[16:08:45] <danheberden> :)
[16:08:46] <danheberden> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/96a349e46d61ee05e576b8544051e375094c0b4d
[16:08:47] <b-ot> danheberden, Mike Sherov (4w 21h ago): Better dependency versions for grunt packages, thanks @Krinkle!
[16:08:52] <danheberden> so 2.0 is fine
[16:08:56] <danheberden> but 1.9 was fucked
[16:09:00] <danheberden> because it installs rc5
[16:09:13] <danheberden> so now i want to see what happens with rc5 on 2.0
[16:09:13] <DaveMethvin> the latest 1.9 shoudl not
[16:09:20] <DaveMethvin> DONT DO IT
[16:09:27] <DaveMethvin> SAVE YOURSELF
[16:09:27] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: the "latest" 1.9?
[16:09:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[16:09:40] <danheberden> that's a fixed point in time, ya?
[16:09:55] <DaveMethvin> you mean tag 1.9.0 ?
[16:10:05] <DaveMethvin> we got that fixed before release
[16:10:06] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: http://danheberden.com/share/70426.png
[16:10:08] <danheberden> yuppers
[16:10:18] <danheberden> wellllll
[16:10:20] <danheberden> ^^^
[16:10:24] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[16:10:31] <danheberden> so lets see what happens on 2.0
[16:10:49] <danheberden> well
[16:10:52] <danheberden> lemme build 1.9 first
[16:10:56] <danheberden> like i wanted to 
[16:10:59] <danheberden> this whole effing time
[16:11:15] <danheberden> ok yes still 32k
[16:11:16] <danheberden> haha
[16:12:29] <DaveMethvin> i agree danheberden i could swear we fixed that before release
[16:12:39] <DaveMethvin> it must have been in 2.0
[16:12:45] <danheberden> i bet you did before you released it
[16:12:46] <danheberden> just not in the tag
[16:12:50] <DaveMethvin> i am losing my mind or something
[16:12:55] <danheberden> cuz after that 
[16:12:57] <danheberden> is adam's commit
[16:13:07] <danheberden> and i'm sure it worked then
[16:13:11] <danheberden> cuz it was rc4
[16:13:14] <DaveMethvin> oh you are probably right
[16:13:22] <DaveMethvin> i should have updated the tag
[16:13:30] <DaveMethvin> it's pretty useless as is
[16:13:39] <DaveMethvin> AS YOU FOUND OUT
[16:13:58] <danheberden> ok here goes the fun part
[16:13:59] <DaveMethvin> such a mess
[16:14:02] <danheberden> installing latest grunt
[16:14:19] <DaveMethvin> oh why do your torture yourself so?
[16:14:35] <danheberden> because i want to see it die
[16:14:37] <danheberden> BURN
[16:14:43] <danheberden> and whatever the eff is going on
[16:14:45] <danheberden> is a bug in rc5
[16:14:50] <danheberden> so i'll share it i guess
[16:14:52] <DaveMethvin> yes, it's the plugins
[16:14:52] <danheberden> maybe?
[16:15:08] <DaveMethvin> the grunt-contrib stuff needs updating for rc5
[16:15:19] <danheberden> ah
[16:15:20] <danheberden> well then
[16:15:23] <danheberden> i won't worrya bout it
[16:15:27] <DaveMethvin> but they were updated using hte same version numbers :(
[16:15:29] <danheberden> since i already ran the task and the submodules are updated
[16:15:35] <danheberden> it's workign fine
[16:15:37] <danheberden> *working fine
[16:15:45] <DaveMethvin> everything is norbal
[16:15:50] <danheberden> well, i wouldn't say working
[16:15:54] <danheberden> just... not obliterating itself
[16:16:20] <DaveMethvin> so is it all under control now?
[16:16:27] <DaveMethvin> i think it's still safe to say 32k
[16:16:31] <DaveMethvin> for 1.9
[16:16:39] <DaveMethvin> 2.0 is about 29k
[16:16:57] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: yeah, just will have to watch it moving forward
[16:17:01] <danheberden> like - test on a fresh pull
[16:17:06] <DaveMethvin> godspeed danheberden
[16:17:07] <danheberden> with new submodules and stuff
[16:29:06] <danheberden> ok DaveMethvin
[16:29:09] <danheberden> whatever the problem was
[16:29:11] <danheberden> it was particular to 1.9
[16:29:21] <danheberden> running latest grunt now just breaks
[16:29:26] <danheberden> it doesn't, like, remove the git repo
[16:30:07] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/33bab.png
[16:30:24] <DaveMethvin> well the 2.0 file is nailed to the right commits https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/86278d40ae86ecd45786eebcb20b72564f2bb53f/package.json
[16:30:59] <DaveMethvin> i think what must have  happened is that i did hte npm install on master and then built 1.9
[16:31:03] <DaveMethvin> which works
[16:31:14] <DaveMethvin> since it ignores the incorrect crap in the package.json file
[16:31:33] <DaveMethvin> but i wonder how testswarm is getting the right answer ...
[16:31:34] <danheberden> i'm just glad there isn't teh same catastrophic failure
[16:31:35] <danheberden> heh
[16:31:37] <danheberden> cuz that was funny
[16:31:46] <DaveMethvin> funny, yeah... :/
[17:34:02] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[17:34:42] <scott_gonzalez> What did you guys do to animations?
[17:34:45] <scott_gonzalez> You're killing me.
[18:52:49] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: cmon now
[18:52:59] <mikesherov> :-P
[18:55:00] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: :-)
[18:55:23] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: meanwhile, I'm almost done with the placeHolder stuff
[18:55:34] <scott_gonzalez> nice
[18:56:00] <mikesherov> I needed to make an effects prefilter that changes display on all the elements you're animating first...
[18:56:53] <mikesherov> because if you're going from hidden to shown, and animate one at a time, relative to absolute can change the computed width of the element
[18:57:26] <mikesherov> unless you change all the element's displays first, to get what the expected apparent width is first, and lock it in
[18:57:53] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[18:58:19] <mikesherov> WHATEVER DaveMethvin 
[18:58:40] <DaveMethvin> it's gonna take fewer bytes tho, right? :)
[18:59:26] <DaveMethvin> just keep it under 33000 bytes gzip
[18:59:32] <DaveMethvin> let me see what 1.9 is
[18:59:35] <mikesherov> only in UI
[18:59:39] <DaveMethvin> oh, 32999 :P
