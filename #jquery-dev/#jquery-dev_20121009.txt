[02:48:36] <jaubourg> hi there
[02:48:36] <bot-t> (18 hours 50 mins ago) <kswedberg> tell jaubourg: Please take a look at http://forum.jquery.com/topic/promise-on-multiple-elements-violates-documentated-behaviour#14737000003623076
[02:51:10] <jaubourg> jzaefferer: so, how do I get from the hotel to your work-place easily? Public transport at the train station?
[02:52:26] <jaubourg> and hi, I'm in Cologne!
[02:54:48] <jzaefferer> jaubourg: Hi!
[02:54:56] <jaubourg> :)
[02:55:01] <jzaefferer> jaubourg: where are you about? which hotel?
[02:55:21] <jzaefferer> public transport generally works, depending where you are, I can pick you up, saves you 10 minutes walking
[02:55:23] <jaubourg> the Eden Hotel right next to the station
[02:55:35] <jaubourg> I don't want to bother you
[02:55:36] <jzaefferer> station?
[02:55:39] <jzaefferer> Hbf?
[02:55:42] <jaubourg> yep
[02:56:15] <jaubourg> on the other side of this big religious building I fail to retain the name of in my poor feeble memory
[02:56:17] <jzaefferer> okay, so just take a train from Gleis 9/10 to Deutz
[02:56:34] <jaubourg> ok
[02:57:17] <jaubourg> I get off at the first station?
[02:57:49] <jzaefferer> yep, just across the river
[02:57:53] <jzaefferer> then walk a little: https://maps.google.com/maps?saddr=s-bahnhof+messe+deutz&daddr=Deutz-M%C3%BClheimer+Stra%C3%9Fe+129&hl=en&ie=UTF8&ll=50.944341,6.981125&spn=0.009545,0.022638&sll=50.943963,6.983399&sspn=0.009545,0.022638&geocode=FT1LCQMdMnFqACmTvHw9xiW_RzEq2a1r4-dwnA%3BFZ5rCQMdS5xqACmHRb9P3SW_RzEL3pGMhm5oig&dirflg=w&mra=ls&t=m&z=16
[02:58:15] <jzaefferer> maps says its 19 minutes
[02:58:26] <jaubourg> ok
[02:58:32] * jaubourg maps usually lie ;)
[02:58:36] <jzaefferer> if you get there not quite yet, I can pick you up
[02:59:05] <jzaefferer> if you get there by yourself, ring at "cowoco" (or coworking cologne)
[02:59:12] <jzaefferer> address is also here: http://colognejs.de/
[02:59:28] <jaubourg> ok, great
[02:59:50] <jaubourg> I think I'll look around the city a bit then come to cowoco in the middle of the afternoon
[02:59:57] <jaubourg> sounds good?
[03:00:27] <jzaefferer> okay, sounds good
[03:00:37] <jzaefferer> ping me before you get there, and I'll head over there as well
[03:00:51] <jaubourg> Deal! \o/
[03:00:55] <jzaefferer> you picked a nice day for sightseeing
[03:01:00] <jzaefferer> lots of rain the last few days
[03:01:16] <jaubourg> same in Brussels, I was surprised when exiting the train station
[03:01:23] <jaubourg> I won't complain ;)
[03:01:59] <jaubourg> anyway, I'll log off and I see you at the coworking place in a bit :)
[05:23:52] <jaubourg> jzaefferer: back at the hotel. I put my comp in the bag and I go catch line 3 or 4. Should take me about 20 to 30 mins I think to get to the coworking place ;) Cya soon
[05:34:13] <gibson042> .
[06:35:14] <jaubourg> jzaefferer: in the coworking space sat on a BIG G ;)
[06:39:39] <jzaefferer> jaubourg: great, should be there soonish
[06:39:44] <jzaefferer> finishing up things here
[06:40:03] <jaubourg> np, take your time, I'm good :)
[06:40:17] <jzaefferer> did someone introduce you to the fridge and coffee machine?
[06:40:48] <jaubourg> not yet but everyone is so focussed I dare not speak ;)
[06:41:09] <jaubourg> I'll wait for you and we'll get a coffee together (or tea, dunno which way you swing)
[06:41:21] <jaubourg> hell, I may get a tea :P
[06:43:31] <jzaefferer> I drink both
[06:43:38] <jzaefferer> I can bring some tea bags
[06:43:43] <jzaefferer> Got way too much here
[06:43:47] <jaubourg> coolness \o/
[06:44:06] <jaubourg> been rediscovering lately... found some awesome jasmin in Brussels!
[07:02:51] <jzaefferer> Heh, don't have that
[07:10:43] <jaubourg> dang, I should have brought some
[07:10:57] <jaubourg> next time :)
[07:47:19] <jzaefferer> jaubourg: heading out now, see you soon
[07:50:31] <jaubourg> :)
[13:43:21] <Eviltwin> Huh, $("input:not:checked") actually causes an exception
[13:44:14] <gnarf> Eviltwin: :not(:checked) ?
[13:48:23] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I know it's malformed
[13:48:34] <Eviltwin> I just don't usually run into even malformed selectors that cause an exception
[14:44:56] <gibson042> Eviltwin: you're welcome :)
[16:07:53] <Krinkle|detached> jzaefferer: I heard back from browserstack about some bug I reported, and they were so nice to uprise me about something else
[16:08:01] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Turns out IE6 workers for jquery are stuck.
[16:08:07] <Krinkle> and it's our fault
[16:20:01] <snover> apprise
[16:26:41] <Krinkle> this is the screenshot they sent:
[16:26:41] <Krinkle> http://cl.ly/image/3f20053m112n
[16:26:49] <Krinkle> qunit module 'core' of jquery core, it is too big
[16:27:21] <DaveMethvin> too big?
[16:27:22] <Krinkle> sometimes after a few tries it goes through, but it is too big.
[16:27:46] <Krinkle> too many instructions without any breathing room
[16:27:52] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[16:28:01] <Krinkle> e.g. continuos operation blocking the ui thread
[16:28:15] <Krinkle> we know the "script running slow" warnings, right?
[16:28:23] <Krinkle> even firefox has them
[16:28:25] <DaveMethvin> if i could only scroll down that screen shot to see where it was
[16:28:49] <DaveMethvin> lemme look at the core unit test
[16:28:57] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/971
[16:29:01] <Krinkle> 789 assertions
[16:29:13] <Krinkle> the #2 biggest
[16:29:40] <Krinkle> hey what is this
[16:29:41] <Krinkle> "Running Unit tests without PHP is unsupported! The AJAX tests won't run without it and don't expect all tests to pass without it!"
[16:29:44] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/300997
[16:29:53] <Krinkle> did something change to the setup?
[16:31:06] <Krinkle> oh, I see
[16:31:11] <Krinkle> rather confusing phrasing
[16:31:17] <Krinkle> it is passing fine
[16:32:21] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle:  my guess on the stall would be this:
[16:32:21] <DaveMethvin> 	for ( i = 0; i < 50000; i += 1 ) {
[16:32:22] <DaveMethvin> 		html.push(li);
[16:32:22] <DaveMethvin> 	}
[16:32:31] <DaveMethvin> :D
[16:32:39] <Krinkle> the whole thing only takes 7s in Chrome
[16:32:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah but that is CHROME
[16:33:40] <DaveMethvin> i can probably make it run a bit faster by reducing the loop and making the string bigger
[16:33:40] <snover> so use html[html.length] = li
[16:33:42] <snover> problem solved
[16:33:53] <DaveMethvin> it may, you're right snover
[16:34:01] <DaveMethvin> that's marginally faster
[16:34:12] <DaveMethvin> maybe a lot faster in ie6
[16:34:13] <snover> oh, it has nothing to do with speed
[16:34:31] <snover> IE’s slow script warning is based on number of function invocations
[16:34:50] <DaveMethvin> i thought it was "statements"
[16:34:59] <snover> hm
[16:35:01] <snover> maybe it is statements
[16:35:11] <snover> i thought it was dumb and used function invocations
[16:35:21] <DaveMethvin> everything i've known about ie6 i have worked damn hard to forget
[16:36:23] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/core.js#L646
[16:36:25] <Krinkle> Or maybe it checked the number of curly braces, regardless of script content
[16:36:36] <Krinkle> don't expect anything, its IE6
[16:36:40] <snover> you’re right, it is statements
[16:36:42] <snover> oh well
[16:36:43] <DaveMethvin> just checking the rest of the file
[16:36:58] <Krinkle> I'm prepping a clean up commit now for unit tests
[16:37:33] <snover> “Internet Explorer … tracks the total number of executed script statements and resets the value each time that a new script execution is started, such as from a timeout or from an event handler … it is possible to execute more than the default limit without the dialog if the entire script execution finishes before the script engine polls Internet Explorer.” woo
[16:37:50] <snover> that last part i left in for fun
[16:38:08] <snover> the default limit is 5 million
[16:38:20] * DaveMethvin holds pinky to mouth
[16:45:45] <Krinkle> Why do we use ["prop"] in test/unit/core.js
[16:45:49] <Krinkle> what's wrong with .prop ?
[16:49:13] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: snover: https://github.com/Krinkle/jquery/compare/test
[16:52:15] <DaveMethvin> haha Krinkle the uppercase bothered me too
[16:52:24] <Krinkle> oh ahm. I think I just exposed our sacred testswarm token
[16:52:42] <DaveMethvin> we use ["prop"] to be kind to Closure Compiler Advanced Optimizations
[16:53:00] <DaveMethvin> exposing our private parts? oh no!
[16:53:08] <Krinkle> fixing..
[16:53:25] <Krinkle> (its not a problematic token in anyway, just a high level guard against unwanted clients)
[16:54:42] <Krinkle> It was exposed in the screenshot browserstack sent us
[16:55:04] <Krinkle> Luckily there is a built-in script to refresh the tokens
[16:55:34] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: okay, makes sense.
[16:55:59] <Krinkle> though for some reason my editor doesn't like it. It does use .jshintrc
[16:56:22] <DaveMethvin> okay, it's time to look at the pull queue
[17:08:06] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/STLUcA
[17:08:06] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Test: Clean up and fix misc issues - Timo Tijhof

[17:14:54] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: doesn't seem to help IE6
[17:14:57] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/986
[17:15:00] <Krinkle> still stuck on core
[17:15:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah, looking at it again now
[17:15:39] <Krinkle> maybe try with a local ssh tunnel with browserstack and see if you can pinpoint it
[17:17:12] <DaveMethvin> yep, doing that now :D
[17:17:29] <DaveMethvin> aw damn, took my eyes off the screen
[17:18:37] <DaveMethvin> "jQuery.sub() - Static Methods" seems the likely suspect
[17:20:09] <DaveMethvin> oh boy
[17:20:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's a shitload of deepEqual
[17:21:11] <DaveMethvin> we're only about a week away from ripping this out anyway since jQuery.sub() is gone as of 1.9
