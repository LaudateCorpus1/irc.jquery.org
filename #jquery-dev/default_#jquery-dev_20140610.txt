[10:21:14] <mikesherov_> markelog: you there?
[10:21:20] <markelog> hey
[10:21:28] <mikesherov_> can I get a thumbs up on: https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs/pull/366
[10:21:43] <markelog> looking at right now
[10:21:44] <mikesherov_> then I can merge that, and I think we're all set for 1.5.0
[10:21:45] <mikesherov_> thanks
[10:22:31] <markelog> it's kinda weird that this thing would show up on every file
[11:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> Is anyone else having auth problems with GitHub?
[11:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> `git pull` is failing for me.
[11:02:39] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: same
[12:05:36] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: What's the deal with sizzle tests inside jQuery?
[12:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L56-L59
[12:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> That's not actually doing anything now. https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/bower.json#L21
[12:06:27] <timmywil> Leftover artifact probably
[12:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> So do you want the test files that already exist to stay in place?
[12:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> Or should they go away?
[12:07:15] <timmywil> They can go I believe
[12:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:21:04] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: What is this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/build/tasks/build.js#L28
[12:21:49] <timmywil> path setting for r.js optimizer
[12:22:29] <timmywil> Should point to the location of Sizzle proper
[12:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> What is it relative to? The src directory?
[12:23:00] <timmywil> yea
[12:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'm moving sizzle to /external/sizzle/dist/sizzle.js, so I can change that to "../extenral/sizzle/dist/sizzle" ?
[12:25:05] <timmywil> that should work
[12:31:25] <scott_gonzalez> I think this is working. Tests all pass :-)

[12:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm... timmywil, I think there's a bug in bowercopy.
[12:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1593/files#diff-35b4a816e0441e6a375cd925af50752cR66 works with the version in this repo, but not with 1.0.0.
[12:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> It treats the dest as a path.
[12:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> Specifying the path as "sinon/" works, but that seems wrong.
[12:45:02] <timmywil> I'm not seeing "sinon" in the config
[12:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> It shouldn't linked to line 66
[12:45:36] <scott_gonzalez> "sinon/LICENSE": "sinon/LICENSE"
[12:45:45] <scott_gonzalez> s/shouldn't/should've/
[12:45:56] <timmywil> i see
[12:46:57] <timmywil> Yea, it assumes you're specifying a directory if there's no extension.
[12:48:14] <scott_gonzalez> Seems odd.
[12:48:27] <scott_gonzalez> I would think this conditional just shouldn't exist: https://github.com/timmywil/grunt-bowercopy/blob/master/tasks/bowercopy.js#L193
[12:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> If you're copying a single file, you should just specify the target file name, not the directory.
[12:49:27] <timmywil> An issue was opened arguing the opposite.
[12:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> This is limited to a single file anyway, since you can't duplicate the dest directory as a key.
[12:49:59] <timmywil> But I'm not opposed to either way really.
[12:50:38] <timmywil> "sinon": is shorter, but "sinon/LICENSE" is specific.
[12:50:47] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it was jzaefferer and we're not doing what he said anymore.
[12:50:48] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[12:53:18] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there is a compromise.
[12:53:29] <scott_gonzalez> You could check if the dest exists and is a directory and use the current behavior.
[12:53:50] <scott_gonzalez> If it doesn't exist or isn't a directory, it should be treated as an explicit path.
[12:54:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's a better check anyway, since directories can contain dots.
[12:54:58] <timmywil> Unless it's supposed to create the directory. Maybe an option? directory: false or something
[12:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> Seems odd that someone would be copying a single file to a new directory. But it also seems odd to me that he wanted this behavior in the first place.
[12:57:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just use LICENSE.txt as the dest.

[14:16:47] <JamesMGreene> Anyone know if plugins.jquery.com will gracefully handle a plugin's repo being transferred to a new owner (org)?

[15:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> `tell JamesMGreene Yes, but you need to send a notification to plugins@jquery.com before trying to publish a new version from the new owner. Otherwise it will be rejected since only one owner can exist.
[15:04:33] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Iâ€™ll tell JamesMGreene about that.
[19:49:37] <JamesMGreene> Hey b-ot, gimme my messages or whatever
[19:49:37] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[19:49:41] <JamesMGreene> `read
[19:49:42] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: From scott_gonzalez, 4h 45m ago: Yes, but you need to send a notification to plugins@jquery.com before trying to publish a new version from the new owner. Otherwise it will be rejected since only one owner can exist.
