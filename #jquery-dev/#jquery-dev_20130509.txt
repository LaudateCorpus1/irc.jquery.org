[06:19:56] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you there?
[06:19:56] <bot-t> (58 hours 40 mins ago) <DaveStein> tell mikesherov I think scrolling is failing since _handleScrolling modifies originalPointer to keep element on screen in some way. i actually notice a jitter when going ove rscroll when going right, but not going down, like test indicates
[06:19:56] <bot-t> (58 hours 40 mins ago) <DaveStein> tell mikesherov in fact it lags in both directions now that i tried a few more times. man i have some comments in my code but not enough! at least i know its that one function
[06:20:19] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov yep
[06:20:39] <mikesherov> I forgot to put the team meeting time on my calendar, can you remind me when it is?
[06:20:49] <DaveMethvin> noon on mondays
[06:20:55] <mikesherov> haha, board meeting
[06:20:58] <DaveMethvin> oh the june one
[06:21:03] <DaveMethvin> let me double check
[06:21:05] <mikesherov> right :-)
[06:21:21] <mikesherov> Although considering my attendance, a refresher on the Monday time isn't out of order
[06:21:25] <DaveMethvin> June 11 all day
[06:21:44] <DaveMethvin> but that's west coast time so i would guess we start at noon eastern 
[06:22:12] <mikesherov> what about the teleconference?
[06:22:19] <mikesherov> that is all day too?
[06:22:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah we can set it up and leave it going
[06:22:34] <mikesherov> ok, great
[06:22:36] <mikesherov> thanks!
[06:28:43] <m_gol-> DaveMethvin: still here?
[06:28:56] <DaveMethvin> m_gol- yep
[06:29:23] <m_gol> I'd like to discuss this source map mess
[06:29:32] <DaveMethvin> oh sure
[06:29:46] <m_gol> I don't know if you followed the thread
[06:29:49] <m_gol> recently
[06:29:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah, some stuff added yesterday
[06:30:03] <m_gol> anyway, I see only two solutions
[06:30:33] <m_gol> either to empower the sourceMappingURL parsing to be able to get the source file name and maybe perform some string modifications
[06:30:41] <jqcommit> [13jquery.com] 15rjmunro opened pull request #36: Update version of migrate plugin on download page (06master...06patch-1)  02http://git.io/ylLt9g
[06:30:54] <m_gol> or to create a separate option that just takses the lib.js file and creates map named lib.js.map or lib.map
[06:31:10] <m_gol> it seems we're coming closer to the second one, though it's fugly
[06:31:32] <DaveMethvin> there are two (unrelated) problems here
[06:31:38] <m_gol> but the first one has a disatvantage of requiring more "sofiscitated" tools to parse the sourceMappingURL input
[06:31:52] <DaveMethvin> one is the use of //@ which triggers IE @cc_on behavior
[06:32:05] <DaveMethvin> that shoudl be fixable by changing the sequence
[06:32:05] <m_gol> yep, I pinged you on Twitter that apparently they're willing to change that
[06:32:15] <m_gol> at least that's what Nick told me directly on Front Trends ;)
[06:32:18] <DaveMethvin> or documenting that people MUST wrap
[06:32:22] <DaveMethvin> in a /* */
[06:32:33] <m_gol> yup
[06:32:38] <DaveMethvin> well the spec hasn't changed, the doc on google docs
[06:32:53] <DaveMethvin> the other is the concern that default naming would be inefficient
[06:32:59] <DaveMethvin> i dont' see why it has to be
[06:33:01] <m_gol> yeah, not so far, I'll maybe try to ping him about the timing...
[06:33:27] <DaveMethvin> so it would only go looking for the file, a specific url, if ...
[06:33:37] <m_gol> not default naming but sth like: sourceMappingURL=${source,2,7}-sth.map
[06:33:54] <DaveMethvin> that seems harder
[06:33:57] <m_gol> well, just looking without asking is not a good solution, too
[06:34:00] <m_gol> too many 404
[06:34:11] <m_gol> I loathe the favicon implicit loading for exactly this reason...
[06:34:11] <DaveMethvin> only if you start to debug
[06:34:19] <m_gol> hmm
[06:34:24] <m_gol> that's a valid remark ;)
[06:34:32] <DaveMethvin> it would only need the map if you want to set a breakpoint
[06:34:43] <DaveMethvin> or perhaps if there was an error that you looked up in the console
[06:34:48] <DaveMethvin> but either is relatively rare
[06:34:54] <m_gol> yeah, for some reason I didn't think about it...
[06:34:57] <DaveMethvin> not like the favicon situation where it happens for plain users
[06:35:44] <m_gol> do you actually have to click on the error message to force the map file loading?
[06:35:51] <m_gol> or just opening the console's enough?
[06:36:00] <DaveMethvin> i dunno when they need the map
[06:36:03] <DaveMethvin> i's also be okay with some  //@sourceMappingURL=DEFAULT
[06:36:16] <DaveMethvin> with DEFAULT being a keyword meaning, look for the default name
[06:36:26] <DaveMethvin> rather than make them parse a bunch of junk
[06:36:50] <m_gol> then there's concern of the js file being named "DEFAULT" :D
[06:37:01] <m_gol> I'm sure SOMEONE did sth like that somewhere
[06:37:10] <DaveMethvin> we they are screwed then :)
[06:37:16] <m_gol> :)
[06:37:34] <m_gol> well, maybe that's a clever point of view
[06:37:48] <m_gol> doesn't seem so pure to create exceptions, though
[06:37:58] <m_gol> well, the problem is the spec is not only for JS
[06:38:06] <m_gol> CSS can be minified in this way, too
[06:38:08] <m_gol> etc.
[06:38:13] <DaveMethvin> that's fine
[06:38:33] <m_gol> and I'm not sure if we can be absolutely sure there won't be any case where naming sth DEFAULT is actually the norm
[06:38:55] <m_gol> so Nick proposed to create a separate pragma @hasImplicitSourceMap
[06:38:56] <DaveMethvin> so there just needs to be a simple rule on how to construct the map and original source name from the minififed file which is the only file we have to start with
[06:39:03] <DaveMethvin> that would be fine too
[06:39:20] <DaveMethvin> but using ## instead of @ or something
[06:39:23] <m_gol> yep
[06:39:30] <m_gol> I reminded him of that ;)
[06:39:48] <m_gol> still, I have to say this is not ideal
[06:39:56] <m_gol> because we can do 2 separate things:
[06:40:10] <m_gol> 1) name sth however we want but with no relation to the original file name
[06:40:28] <m_gol> 2) name sth relating to the original file in a strictly defined way
[06:40:39] <DaveMethvin> rules aren't bad
[06:40:57] <m_gol> which would cause problems if sb had a file structure where libs are under lib/lib.js and the dev files under /dev/lib.map
[06:41:18] <DaveMethvin> they'd both need to be accessible from http to debug tho
[06:41:29] <DaveMethvin> so why use a complex structure?
[06:41:32] <m_gol> which might be not so rare as it's the simplest way to block most people from accessing debug files
[06:41:34] <DaveMethvin> but if you want to...
[06:41:45] <DaveMethvin> but then you're back to getting 404
[06:41:52] <DaveMethvin> or 401
[06:41:57] <m_gol> hah, right
[06:42:05] <m_gol> so this is a separate, 3rd problem ;D
[06:42:14] <DaveMethvin> and the complex name-it-anything approach solves all of those anyway
[06:42:28] <DaveMethvin> the problem i want to solve is the one that the google cdn guys did
[06:42:37] <DaveMethvin> which is, assume rightly that it was fine to rename the files
[06:42:48] <DaveMethvin> because it has ALWAYS been okay to just rename files on the web
[06:42:52] <DaveMethvin> until now
[06:43:08] <m_gol> well, adding a @hasImplicitURL pragma wouldn't solve it completely
[06:43:17] <DaveMethvin> how come
[06:43:27] <m_gol> if sb has a complicated structure with map files in a different dir than the js file
[06:43:36] <m_gol> they'd need to use the regular @sourceMappingURL
[06:43:44] <DaveMethvin> yep, which is fine with me
[06:43:46] <m_gol> and then when sb renames, they're screwed as now
[06:43:50] <m_gol> k
[06:43:50] <DaveMethvin> yep
[06:44:01] <m_gol> you seem more pragmatic than me, sir! ;)
[06:44:26] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure there are more ways to solve the in-between cases but i'm okay with this
[06:44:32] <DaveMethvin> it keeps their job a lot simpler
[06:44:37] <m_gol> Nick wrote that he might go with @hasImplicitSourceMap pragma if no one comes with a better idea, though he doesn't like it
[06:45:02] <m_gol> as for the @
[06:45:08] <m_gol> I'll probably try to push for it
[06:45:14] <DaveMethvin> the idea of making some macro language to parse file names is one that I'd avoid
[06:45:17] <m_gol> we now see enormous numer of tools for generating maps
[06:45:21] <m_gol> * source maps
[06:45:33] <DaveMethvin> and most of them unfortunately break in IE with @cc_on
[06:45:40] <m_gol> so the later the pragma changes, the more likely is that the current @ usage is too widespread already...
[06:45:46] <DaveMethvin> yep
[06:46:22] <DaveMethvin> so 1.10 beta 1 should be out later today...any last minute requests?
[06:46:25] <m_gol> ok, so we seem to be in agreement
[06:46:31] <DaveMethvin> yep
[06:46:46] <m_gol> I've missed last meeting :/
[06:47:30] <DaveMethvin> i think it's all under control, np
[06:48:04] <m_gol> ok, no requests from me as for the beta
[06:48:15] <gibson042> hey guys... if we're dreaming, I'd like to see map specified *outside* the JS so we can avoid these wacky issues
[06:48:36] <DaveMethvin> now that would be nice
[06:48:40] <DaveMethvin> so it will never happen :)
[06:48:44] <m_gol> :D
[06:48:45] <gibson042> 8-)
[06:48:46] <DaveMethvin> since they want to avoid another request
[06:49:07] <gibson042> *cough* <link> *cough*
[06:49:19] <m_gol> well, when (if?) they change the @ pragma to # or ! or sth we'll be able to put the comment at the end and the problem will disappear
[06:49:20] <DaveMethvin> they don't want to parse the html
[06:49:56] <DaveMethvin> oh actually i meant to look at that, one of the maps didn't look right when i did a test build
[06:50:07] <DaveMethvin> it was referring to jquery-pre.js
[06:50:16] <gibson042> yeah, I know
[06:50:26] <gibson042> but THIS: "because it has ALWAYS been okay to just rename files on the web"
[06:50:36] <gibson042> is worth a lot
[06:50:44] <DaveMethvin> it's just assumed
[06:51:04] <gibson042> yeah
[06:51:09] <m_gol> specifying map location in a separate file wouldn't solve that problem, tough
[06:51:11] <m_gol> * though
[06:51:30] <gibson042> sure it would
[06:51:41] <DaveMethvin> you could update the defn file separately
[06:51:51] <m_gol> ah, in this sense, ok
[06:51:52] <gibson042> I tell you that y is a map for x
[06:51:58] <gibson042> external to x
[06:52:09] <m_gol> yeah, well, the current way creates circular dependencies which is not nice
[06:52:17] <gibson042> exactly
[06:52:24] <m_gol> ha, that looks great
[06:52:31] <m_gol> maybe you could propose sth on the list? ;)
[06:52:41] <m_gol> https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap
[06:53:00] <DaveMethvin> this format is definitely created with simplicity for the browser in mind
[06:53:48] <m_gol> that would actually remove the need for some name parsing, you'd just define maps: {"jquery.min.js": "jquery.min.map"}
[06:54:11] <DaveMethvin> it would just be a json file, and browsers know json
[06:54:24] <m_gol> I'm not optimistic about their will to introduce such a change to the spec at this level
[06:54:29] <m_gol> but, well, we can try
[06:54:46] <DaveMethvin> especially because it would be an "in addition" thing i suspect
[06:54:55] <m_gol> yeah
[06:55:03] <DaveMethvin> but the //@ sequence has to change, regardless
[06:55:13] <DaveMethvin> the sooner the better
[06:55:30] <m_gol> but that's sick that source map refers to specific parts of the minified file that can be moved by introducing a comment with source map location...
[06:55:54] <m_gol> I'll post there about @ again, this is the most important of all those issues IMGO
[06:55:56] <m_gol> * IMHO
[06:56:06] <gibson042> I'm actually ok with that m_gol
[06:56:14] <gibson042> because it maps comments too
[06:56:36] <DaveMethvin> the //@ newline-terminated comment makes me uneasy
[06:56:42] <DaveMethvin> esp at the end of the file
[06:56:58] <gibson042> right
[06:57:12] <gibson042> the problem is in its syntax and default location
[06:57:26] <DaveMethvin> but sourcemaps already break the common practice of concatting files so i guess it doesn't matter
[06:57:43] <DaveMethvin> except for the first file concatted i suppose
[06:58:05] <DaveMethvin> assuming you get the file names right, etc
[06:58:46] <gibson042> none of which matters if we can get the map info *out* of the source file
[06:59:01] <gibson042> if we're to push on anything, I'd like it to be that
[07:01:05] <m_gol> I posted about @ here again: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap/4uo7Z5nTfUY
[07:02:25] <m_gol> is there any volunteer to describe the JSON config concept on the list? ;)
[07:03:03] <DaveMethvin> i'm posting a reply emphasizing my support for some changes here
[07:03:12] <m_gol> k
[07:03:23] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 do you want to propose the separate file?
[07:06:38] <gibson042> I don't think I have the availability for making sufficient noise on this, unfortunately, but I'll try to get something up there
[07:11:01] <m_gol> ok, so we're set, let's hope it works
[07:11:58] <DaveMethvin> had to reboot, something was going haywire with my pointing devices
