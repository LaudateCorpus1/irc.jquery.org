[08:56:27] <DaveMethvin> timmywil m_gol _markelog gibson042 I have a cool idea...let's do a release today! :)
[08:56:38] <timmywil> WAT
[08:56:38] <b-ot> timmywil: My site is completely unavailable because of you! You bitch!
[08:56:39] <gibson042> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH
[08:56:43] <DaveMethvin> of course a couple of things we might want to fix
[08:56:52] <DaveMethvin> b-ot pegged it that time
[08:57:03] <timmywil> b-ot: I'm sorry!
[08:57:20] <timmywil> I'm currently cleaning up tix
[08:57:30] <_markelog> we are now falling on ie11 of manipulation module
[08:57:34] <DaveMethvin> i have a fix for that IE11 fail but am a bit hesitant to put it in this release
[08:57:38] <_markelog> thanks m_gol!
[08:57:40] <_markelog> )
[08:57:55] <DaveMethvin> it SEEMS to work for all IE though
[08:57:59] <DaveMethvin> i have the pr for it
[08:58:20] <_markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1495/files
[08:58:20] <_markelog> ?
[08:58:20] <timmywil> he says tremulously
[08:58:52] <DaveMethvin> i can land it i guess
[08:59:06] <DaveMethvin> but then we still have the fails for ie6/7
[08:59:18] <DaveMethvin> WHY?
[08:59:33] <_markelog> swarm and sinon
[08:59:42] <_markelog> so it's just support change?
[08:59:44] <DaveMethvin> i'm telling ya, we really should drop those two as in 1.12/2.2
[08:59:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah, just using textarea as the canary for the feature
[09:00:04] <DaveMethvin> actually the old detect was not even looking at defaultValue
[09:00:17] <DaveMethvin> which is what we need to fix
[09:00:19] <_markelog> if you test it, i think we okay
[09:00:35] <DaveMethvin> let me just run thru it ONE more time :)
[09:00:44] <_markelog> > we really should drop those two as in 1.12/2.2
[09:00:45] <_markelog> wow!
[09:01:00] <DaveMethvin> i put that on the agenda for San Diego
[09:01:09] <_markelog> i'm not even sure we will cover all issues in San Diego )
[09:01:20] <DaveMethvin> by the time they ship, maybe mid-year, ie6/7 should be really small
[09:01:23] <_markelog> since we will have only couple days
[09:01:33] <DaveMethvin> it will be a lightning round
[09:01:40] <DaveMethvin> did i share the agenda yet?
[09:01:48] <_markelog> let me see
[09:02:11] <DaveMethvin> no i didn't
[09:02:15] <DaveMethvin> okay let me do that
[09:02:16] <_markelog> yeah
[09:02:35] <_markelog> only ui team has something
[09:03:08] <gibson042> meh... there's not much that IE6-7 but not IE8
[09:03:19] <gibson042> parts of attributes come to mind, but not much else
[09:03:42] <DaveMethvin> it knocks two troublesome browsers off our test list :)
[09:03:51] <timmywil> meh
[09:05:19] <gibson042> degraded status, absolutely
[09:06:02] <DaveMethvin> untested code is broken code though
[09:06:10] <DaveMethvin> so we either test it and keep it going or drop it
[09:07:44] <gibson042> UI has levels of support
[09:08:12] <DaveMethvin> and they've already dropped ie6 btw
[09:08:34] <gibson042> I'm cool with dropping it
[09:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> whoa https://github.com/fre5h/DoctrineEnumBundle/pull/12
[09:08:48] <gibson042> there just won't be large code impact
[09:09:46] <DaveMethvin> our levels of support are "sure i use it everyday", "darn i could have sworn that worked", "how come you're monkey patching that", and "StackOverflow answers don't document our API"
[09:10:49] <gibson042> :D
[09:11:02] <timmywil> I think I missed something. are you still talking about IE6/7?
[09:11:34] <scott_gonzalez> UI doens't have levels of support, Mobile does.
[09:11:36] <DaveMethvin> no, we moved on although the agenda has a bullet for it
[09:12:31] <DaveMethvin> damn, running full tests on oldIE sucks
[09:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Do you want infra-related stuff in that doc?
[09:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> Like code coverage discussion.
[09:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> Or stricly core stuff in this doc?
[09:18:01] <ryanneufeld> Morning
[09:18:08] <DaveMethvin> we could put it there ... we were doing a common discussion in the morning right?
[09:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> hopefully :-)
[09:18:28] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: about dropping ie6/7 in 1.x, didn't we promise that 1.x would always work on those?
[09:18:41] <DaveMethvin> ALWAYS
[09:19:11] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: so then why remove support in 1.x?
[09:19:35] <ryanneufeld> is it something that can be excluded from the build?
[09:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:19:40] <DaveMethvin> if nobody to a small delta is using them, we can save ourselves a lot of trouble in testing and avoiding breakage
[09:20:00] <DaveMethvin> ie8 still has quite a marketshare but ie6/7 don't
[09:20:09] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rhm7fq9d1p00jmj/Screenshot%202014-01-23%2009.20.08.png
[09:20:15] <ryanneufeld> that's one day of our traffic
[09:21:13] <ryanneufeld> 120k feels significant to me
[09:21:26] <DaveMethvin> so you think ie6/7 is used a lot by people visiting our sites?
[09:21:39] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure those are real
[09:21:56] <_markelog> we talking about the whole world here, if it's small percentage, it still could be big in absolute numbers
[09:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> I think our = ryanneufeld's company.
[09:22:06] <ryanneufeld> I take that back, that's from Dec 23 to Jan 22
[09:22:07] <DaveMethvin> oh lyrics
[09:22:17] <_markelog> but we could save that discussion for San Diego
[09:22:23] <DaveMethvin> then those are click fraud bots :)
[09:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:22:31] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: you can't prove that :p
[09:22:48] <DaveMethvin> our revenue model depends on it!
[09:23:46] <ryanneufeld> so for 24 hours we see about 10k visits with IE7 as the UA
[09:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> These are the stats for my personal site: http://cl.ly/image/1Y1h2R151Q12
[09:24:20] <ryanneufeld> IE 6?
[09:24:24] <ryanneufeld> lol
[09:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> This is probably a good view of "normal people": http://cl.ly/image/192f3N191Q2O
[09:25:12] <ryanneufeld> c'mon DaveMethvin .4525638 % of our traffic is IE7
[09:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> That's my dad's pharmacy.
[09:25:31] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: that's pretty even across the board
[09:26:08] <scott_gonzalez> Of course the sample is pretty small.
[09:26:14] <ryanneufeld> This is one day: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zisa9jsvdx12j87/Screenshot%202014-01-23%2009.26.05.png
[09:27:14] <DaveMethvin> but i live in bejing! http://www.modern.ie/ie6countdown
[09:27:30] <ryanneufeld> .363636364 % of our traffic is IE7
[09:27:34] <DaveMethvin> GAAH browserstack timeouts
[09:27:43] <ryanneufeld> POINT THREE PERCENT DAVE!
[09:28:03] <ryanneufeld> I'm willing to admit my reaction was rather knee jerk
[09:29:05] <DaveMethvin> the problem is that we're all scarred by a long history of dealing with these old browsers, but in reality they become less relevant every year
[09:29:11] <scott_gonzalez> Even if a company makes $1/mo off a customer on IE7, with stats like yours, that's $1.5M/yr.
[09:29:33] <DaveMethvin> first of all these are stats from before XP goes dead
[09:29:37] <ryanneufeld> and that's significant
[09:29:45] <ryanneufeld> XP isn't dying
[09:29:49] <m_gol> IMO it's less about code reduction & more about relaxing time needed for test maintenance
[09:29:51] <DaveMethvin> so by the time we release 1.12 that will be smaller
[09:29:52] <ryanneufeld> MS is extending support for it
[09:29:57] <m_gol> wat
[09:29:58] <b-ot> m_gol: A common tool in functional programming that is of such utility it should be in core.
[09:30:04] <DaveMethvin> no they are not
[09:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Are you thinking about Windows 7?
[09:30:24] <DaveMethvin> they are not supporting XP past April
[09:30:33] <ryanneufeld> oh
[09:30:38] <DaveMethvin> they will support their AV product on XP for another year
[09:30:41] <ryanneufeld> they are extending the anti malware support
[09:30:50] <DaveMethvin> there is a big difference
[09:30:52] <ryanneufeld> I am corrected
[09:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that means that we can expect it to continue hanging on for a least another year, right? :-P
[09:31:35] <DaveMethvin> if someone really has a large IE6/7 audience they can use 1.11
[09:31:52] <DaveMethvin> or, more likely, they will continue to use 1.3.2 or 1.4.2 like they have for the last half-decade
[09:32:32] <DaveMethvin> man i hate unit tests that die when you don't have the debugger open but then work when you do
[09:33:10] <m_gol> 1.2.6
[09:33:16] <ryanneufeld> schrodingers unit test?
[09:33:18] <m_gol> together with 1.4
[09:33:42] <m_gol> everyone knows 1.2 + 1.4 = 2.6 so putting two jQueries is better than our new 2.1, right?
[09:33:50] <DaveMethvin> right so any illusion that Chinese web sites are anxiously downloading the latest jQuery for their IE6 sites is crap
[09:34:20] <DaveMethvin> you do math funny over there in europe m_gol 
[09:34:20] <m_gol> and it's not that we introduced a lot of new APIs recently
[09:34:23] <m_gol> our code is pretty stable
[09:34:27] <m_gol> ;)
[09:34:48] <m_gol> another thing is what browsers do we want to target with $.xhr & stuff
[09:35:18] <m_gol> idk about Europe but in Poland IE6-7 doesn't exist, practically
[09:35:33] <m_gol> 0.5% market share combined
[09:35:34] <DaveMethvin> i think that's something we should talk about in San Diego
[09:36:04] <DaveMethvin> we could use a simple shim perhaps in 1.x but more in 2.x
[09:36:12] <m_gol> sure, I was just thinking it might be worthwile to put it near the to-drop-or-not-to-drop-IE6-7 point in the agenda
[09:36:37] <DaveMethvin> i am thinking if we use standards-based Promise we should use a standard shim and not try to bundle it if the env doesn't support it
[09:36:41] <m_gol> because if we introduce new APIs & support them in IE6-7 we won't be able to drop IE6-7 in 1.13
[09:36:48] <m_gol> since they won't be battle-tested
[09:38:11] <m_gol> it's better to do such things with tested code since then using 1.11 if IE6 support is needed should be pretty safe & shouldn't require fixes on our side
[09:43:25] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: you up for doing the release script a little later today? i still haven't worked out the windows issues
[09:44:02] <ryanneufeld> FYI, I noticed IE usage in general, drops on the weekends for our site
[09:44:14] <ryanneufeld> though none of the other browsers show that same usage
[09:44:47] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: that's a pretty common pattern, you don't see it on a lot of the public stats because they've been averaged over maybe a week
[09:44:58] <ryanneufeld> makes sense
[09:45:01] <ryanneufeld> people go to work
[09:45:03] <ryanneufeld> and only have IE
[09:45:09] <ryanneufeld> cause they're locked on winblows
[09:45:51] <DaveMethvin> you can really see it in this graph which is day by day http://clicky.com/marketshare/global/web-browsers/internet-explorer/
[09:47:09] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: sure! I'll be around
[09:47:38] <DaveMethvin> ok timmywil  i just need to land this ie11 fix and wait for the tests
[09:48:12] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: so we're doing it before the release after all?
[09:48:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah i decided why not, just finishing a few full runs on ie locally
[09:49:15] <DaveMethvin> that way we can say it all works with ie11
[09:49:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: admit it, you could no longer look at this red column for IE11: http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[09:49:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: actually, I think it's reasonable to expect China to continue to install the latest jQuery as mobile market share increases.
[09:49:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah the tests yelling at us is annoying
[09:49:51] <m_gol> timmywil: latest 1.x?
[09:50:15] <m_gol> btw, we had an incorrect value for one support test in Safari 5.1
[09:50:16] <DaveMethvin> i think most of the phones in china are android 2.3 based
[09:50:23] <DaveMethvin> the last fully open source one without any google ties
[09:50:28] <m_gol> but userAgent check was too strict so these tests were never run :D
[09:50:36] <m_gol> since it was added 2-3 years ago
[09:51:51] <m_gol> I always fear changing support test expected values since it should mean we screwed up the support test 99% of the time
[09:52:02] <timmywil> it's hard to say where things will land. I agree a good first step is announcement that we're considering it.
[09:52:21] <DaveMethvin> yes, definitely that timmywil 
[09:52:41] <DaveMethvin> of course we'll hear impassioned cries from both sides no matter what
[09:53:03] <DaveMethvin> ah damn another meeting at 1
[09:55:48] <erwan_> Hi!
[09:56:18] <DaveMethvin> hi erwan_ 
[09:56:32] <erwan_> The following bug, which is in closed state is *not* fixed in jQuery 2.x (although it is fixed in 1.10.1: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12072
[09:56:51] <DaveMethvin> did you see the reply from m_gol ?
[09:57:47] <m_gol> I've answered in the ticket
[09:57:59] <erwan_> Now I have. :)
[09:58:03] <erwan_> Thanks
[09:58:03] <m_gol> 12 minutes ago
[09:58:04] <DaveMethvin> lol ok
[09:58:09] <m_gol> ;)
[09:58:18] <m_gol> so maybe the milestone is just wrong
[09:58:23] <m_gol> because I could reproduce it in 2.0.3
[09:58:28] <m_gol> but not master
[09:59:50] <m_gol> erwan_: to make sure warnings are from jQuery & not jsFiddle, append "/show/" to the URL, you'll get the fiddle without all the edit options
[10:00:20] <DaveMethvin> oh good point
[10:00:37] <m_gol> Firefox does show where the warning originates so that's not necessary
[10:00:46] <m_gol> but I guess people will forget looking at that part of the info ;)
[10:01:48] <m_gol> so it looks like we'll be able to add iOS6 to TestSwarm soon and iOS7 a little later :)
[10:01:58] <erwan_> Nice! Thank you for the tip.
[10:02:26] <m_gol> I need to look at the iOS7 bug, it's kind of scary as it's in ready, for some reason it doesn't catch the load event if jQuery is loaded after DOMContentLoaded :/

[10:50:00] <doesallmagic2> Yippee, build fixed!
[10:50:01] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core build #1062: FIXED in 7 min 27 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/1062/
[10:50:01] <doesallmagic2> Dave Methvin: Manipulation: Use textarea for missing IE defaultValue check
[10:50:29] <DaveMethvin> well there is some progress
[10:50:39] <DaveMethvin> still double checking 1.x
[10:50:59] <m_gol> :)
[10:51:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: the problem is 1.x is flakey not only on oldIE
[10:51:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and not just from sinon
[10:51:37] <m_gol> I wonder if these oldIE-related Sinon fixes could introduce a disturbance in the force?
[10:51:47] <m_gol> hm, ok then
[10:52:08] <m_gol> though those are not test failures but hangs during tests, what could be causing that? :/
[10:52:13] <DaveMethvin> the sinon file is being included but that shouldn't break anything
[10:52:15] <DaveMethvin> who knows
[10:52:51] <DaveMethvin> i was just trying to add ie11 detects to test/support.js, they were totally missing
[10:53:30] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: what IE11 detects?
[10:54:15] <m_gol> because if you're talking about computed support values then I added them already
[10:54:17] <m_gol> yesterday
[10:54:19] <m_gol> to both branches
[10:54:19] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/a20494228d51c57c454ff9f10a4ba8bbdda0e49c/test/unit/support.js#L86-101
[10:55:10] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: you forgot to change the support value on 1.x: https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/commit/0009ae6ffc51875f831eb53de94b5afc9c805328
[10:57:36] <DaveMethvin> i haven't pushed anything to 1.x yet
[10:58:46] <m_gol> ah, ok
[10:58:58] <m_gol> I got fooled by the commit link
[11:02:39] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: for some reason appendChecked is coming up different so i need to figure that out
[11:02:49] <DaveMethvin> maybe i put it in the wrong place in src/support.js
[11:03:28] <m_gol> DaveMethvinL what did you mean when you said about adding ie11 detects to test/support.js?
[11:03:55] <DaveMethvin> it looks like  you added them with your last commit
[11:04:03] <DaveMethvin> i hadn't updated my branch
[11:05:27] <m_gol> ok ;)
[11:05:38] <m_gol> that's what I thought
[11:16:39] <DaveMethvin> if i can just get a 5 minute stretch without interruption i can run browserstack long enough to test this
[11:17:36] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: btw, defaultChecked didn't need to be set explicitly. Both are set the first time.
[11:18:02] <timmywil> thought I might have read some confusion earlier

[11:21:36] <jqcommit> 13jquery/061.x-master 14f345291 15Dave Methvin: Manipulation: Use textarea for missing IE defaultValue check...
[11:26:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: can't you test locally?
[11:30:27] <DaveMethvin> oh geez
[11:30:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah i tested all of that locally, even a full run
[11:30:38] <DaveMethvin> so let me see what broke
[11:31:30] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: these all look like the hangs from swarmy+sinon
[11:31:39] <m_gol> yes, they do
[11:31:48] <m_gol> even though they're not only in effects
[11:31:49] <DaveMethvin> except for the random safari ajax one
[11:32:02] <m_gol> what puzzles me is why it's no longer a problem on master, only on 1.x-master
[11:32:10] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2399
[11:32:29] <DaveMethvin> it only breaks on oldie
[11:32:31] <m_gol> ah, here are in effects only
[11:32:37] <m_gol> ok, but that's not what always happens
[11:32:55] <m_gol> see e.g. http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2394
[11:33:02] <DaveMethvin> it's got to be some interaction between the inject.js from swarm and our tests
[11:33:08] <DaveMethvin> like sinon
[11:33:39] <DaveMethvin> oh you mean why the random failures in 1.x and not 2.x?
[11:34:10] <m_gol> yes
[11:34:13] <DaveMethvin> to paraphrase Monty Python, "Because 2.x doesn't have shit all over it"
[11:34:16] <m_gol> :)
[11:34:53] <DaveMethvin> i sometimes get strangeness when texting 1.x on various IE, but rarely anywhere else unless it's Chrome being all cachey
[11:35:33] <m_gol> these issues are extremely hard to debug
[11:35:57] <m_gol> are there any swarm logs that would say why it got disconnected in a particular moment?
[11:36:10] <DaveMethvin> not that i know of
[11:36:23] <DaveMethvin> it could be that there's some sort of dialog that pops up, hanging the session
[11:36:36] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if we can overwrite window.alert etc just to see if they're being fired
[11:36:47] <DaveMethvin> or maybe inject already does that, lemme look
[11:37:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah it does
[11:37:11] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core 1.x build #363: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201.x/363/
[11:37:12] <doesallmagic2> Dave Methvin: Manipulation: Use textarea for missing IE defaultValue check
[11:37:18] <DaveMethvin> that Krinkle thinks of everything :)
[11:37:22] <m_gol> ok, that's what I meant when speaking about breaking not only in effects: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2399
[11:37:22] <m_gol> haha
[11:37:34] <m_gol> Safari in AJAX, Opera Presto in Core
[11:37:43] <m_gol> in the test run I linked to before it was AJAX in Firefox
[11:37:55] <m_gol> kinda random
[11:38:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah i dunno
[11:39:02] <DaveMethvin> not sure where that message comes from
[11:39:55] <DaveMethvin> hmmmm, there's a use of clearTimeout here https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/js/inject.js#L206
[11:40:12] <DaveMethvin> when we're using sinon that should be protected too
[11:42:03] <m_gol> in here? https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/js/inject.js#L23
[11:42:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah we're protecting setTimeout but not clearTimeout, dunno if that is causing a problem but it could
[11:43:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah, thinking about it that could be a problem
[11:44:39] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Objectray is that thing that pops out of old CD drives, right?
[11:44:59] <DaveMethvin> to hold your coffee
[11:45:41] <DaveMethvin> timer receipts are just small integers, at least the native ones. So if you got a recept of say 14 from the fake timers and then cancelled a the real timer of 14 which happened to be the heartbeat, that could hang the tests
[11:45:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I tried to make a cup holder out of one by hooking up some batteries and building a collapsible tray from the middle (where the mini CDs would fit in)
[11:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> At first I forgot to disconnect the laser out :-/
[11:46:29] <DaveMethvin> don't disable the laser, push the power up and you can have it keep the coffee warm!
[11:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> I also accidentally dragged the soldering iron across my hair.
[11:47:07] <DaveMethvin> ah, the smell of burning hair
[11:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> Good reason to keep your hair short ;-)
[11:47:17] <DaveMethvin> i did that with a welding rod and my neck ones
[11:47:19] <DaveMethvin> once*
[11:47:25] <DaveMethvin> owie
[11:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> How did you manage to get it onto your neck?!?
[11:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> At least my hair was hanging down, away from my face.
[11:48:13] <DaveMethvin> i can't remember
[11:48:29] <DaveMethvin> but to my credit i've never made that mistake again
[11:48:36] <DaveMethvin> although a rarely weld nowadays
[11:50:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm more convinced that it's because clearTimeout isn't protected m_gol 
[11:50:38] <m_gol> why does it work on master then?
[11:51:05] <DaveMethvin> the return values for oldIE may be different?
[11:51:48] <m_gol> yes, but it's not only oldIE
[11:51:57] <m_gol> mostly yes, but sometimes Fx or Safari breaks
[11:52:11] <DaveMethvin> i'm just looking at the sinon problem right now
[11:52:13] <m_gol> but ok, maybe 1.x is just a little more magical ;)
[11:52:22] <m_gol> but that looks promising, great find, Dave :)
[11:53:00] <DaveMethvin> chrome at least doesn't seem to reuse timer numbers
[11:53:11] <DaveMethvin> but of course it would depend on what sinon uses
[11:53:27] <DaveMethvin> they're all really small integers
[11:55:44] <DaveMethvin> okay, well i'm pretty convinced that the errors we are seeing here are test setup problems and not code problems
[11:55:46] <DaveMethvin> soooo
[11:55:55] <DaveMethvin> it's about time for some jquery-release action
[11:56:04] <DaveMethvin> oh timmywil !
[11:56:10] <timmywil> :)
[11:56:13] <timmywil> READY?
[11:56:34] <DaveMethvin> did everyone pee? once we start the car i don't want to stop it until we get there
[11:56:43] <timmywil> actually, I might need to
[11:56:50] <DaveMethvin> well now that you mention it
[11:56:58] <DaveMethvin> i need some more tea
[11:57:06] <timmywil> I shall refill my coffee then
[11:57:09] <timmywil> and pee
[11:57:15] <timmywil> not together
[11:57:21] <DaveMethvin> let's rendezvous at 3pm
[12:00:07] <DaveMethvin> when i was in france the conf organizer kept sending out messages about our rdv, took me a while to realize it was an abbreviation for rendezvous
[12:00:27] <DaveMethvin> i bet jaubourg would have known
[12:02:09] <m_gol> you mean now?
[12:02:24] <m_gol> I'm +6h from you, right?
[12:02:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah, now
[12:03:00] <DaveMethvin> once timmywil gets back, depends on how much he had to pee and whether he had to brew a new pot
[12:03:18] <DaveMethvin> if he was being efficient he shoudl have prefetched the coffee before he peed
[12:03:54] <m_gol> ;)
[12:03:59] <m_gol> are we doing it from new users?
[12:04:06] <m_gol> i.e. not this jquery npm weirdo?
[12:04:39] <DaveMethvin> just a sec, making the testswarm ticket before i forget
[12:06:10] <jqcommit> [13testswarm] 15dmethvin opened issue #298: Protect clearTimeout in inject.js as well 02http://git.io/XzatDQ
[12:06:28] <timmywil> also, I'm submitting a PR to desandro. Almost done
[12:06:41] <timmywil> He's new to AMD, the poor thing.
[12:08:21] <DaveMethvin> so a couple of notes before we start, be sure to grab the author list and the changelog ... dunno if those will be clobbered when you do the second run
[12:09:27] <timmywil> I'll do a test on my repo first
[12:09:44] <DaveMethvin> always a smart idea
[12:20:16] <DaveMethvin> i was not told we were having snow today
[12:20:24] <DaveMethvin> but we are
[12:23:41] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I filed a ticket for .outerWidth() just so it doesn't get lost: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14723
[12:24:12] <DaveMethvin> ok scott_gonzalez, sounded like we were going to make it a docs thing
[12:24:32] <scott_gonzalez> So the docs will say "This won't work in oldIE"?
[12:24:33] <DaveMethvin> esp if we drop ie6/8 :)
[12:24:38] <DaveMethvin> 6/7
[12:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, if we drop 6/7, then fine.
[12:25:19] <DaveMethvin> even if we don't i would say this is a wontfix at this point as far as they are concerned
[12:25:24] <m_gol> we should defer the decision for San Diego
[12:25:27] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can just be dicks like Bootstrap: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/12351
[12:25:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's fine
[12:25:54] <scott_gonzalez> "We don't support third party plugins or frameworks."
[12:26:03] <scott_gonzalez> If you use Bootstrap, you can't use any other plugins.
[12:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[12:26:22] <DaveMethvin> i hate to see THEIR kindergarten report card
[12:26:27] <DaveMethvin> "Doesn't play well with others"
[12:27:12] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:27:12] <DaveMethvin> did you know there were still people using sproutcore? I thought it was kind of dead
[12:27:21] <m_gol> I use * {box-sizing: border-box;} everywhere but in my final projects & not libs
[12:27:22] <DaveMethvin> but there is some activity on their repo
[12:27:54] <DaveMethvin> something that IE got right
[12:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> I love this: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/12351#issuecomment-33159525
[12:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> IT'S SO EASY! Just go manually edit every one of your plugins!
[12:28:33] <DaveMethvin> "I have found it no issue to go into the third party css and adjust the math to include padding and borders, it's actually easier and works better."
[12:28:35] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[12:28:40] <DaveMethvin> NO ISSUE
[12:28:56] <DaveMethvin> don't they know math is hard?
[12:29:36] <m_gol> grunt-fix-box-sizing
[12:29:53] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:30:06] <DaveMethvin> there's a grunt plugin for EVERYTHING
[12:30:13] <DaveMethvin> or should be
[12:30:27] <m_gol> grunt-support-ie6-in-jquery-ui
[12:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[12:31:16] <sonotos> lol
[12:32:30] <timmywil> ok, everything worked but archive production
[12:32:40] <DaveMethvin> oh that reminds me timmywil 
[12:32:48] <DaveMethvin> maybe we don't need to create the archive?
[12:32:57] <timmywil> ?
[12:33:01] <DaveMethvin> we could just create a subfolder and commit the cdn versions with the tag
[12:33:05] <DaveMethvin> then point them to that
[12:33:52] <DaveMethvin> but whatever works for this release, it's not too tricky other than making sure the stupid map files get the right name
[12:33:59] <DaveMethvin> now that we've removed the comment from the min file
[12:35:09] <timmywil> ok, well, lemme see if I can fix this for now. It might be simple.
[12:37:31] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: this is what was generated for the changelog https://gist.github.com/timmywil/3a63b27a1833b9ab9c9b
[12:38:14] <timmywil> and contributors https://gist.github.com/timmywil/db962e5defa51f643cc5
[12:38:37] <timmywil> which somehow got a few commit messages in there
[12:38:50] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[12:39:03] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: what do you usually do with that changelog?
[12:39:09] <DaveMethvin> is it processed somehow?
[12:39:28] <DaveMethvin> eventually it needs to be in the blog
[12:39:50] <DaveMethvin> the old script to generate one out of trac is still around, i can use that if needed
[12:40:06] <DaveMethvin> and the contributor log, i dunno what happened with that
[12:40:21] <DaveMethvin> i'd think it would be more like a git shortlog -nse
[12:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's a manual process after that.
[12:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> The contributors list has commits if they contain the word "thank"
[12:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> They'll always be at the bottom.
[12:41:12] <DaveMethvin> ok timmywil, i can work with that ... fire away!
[12:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> It requires manual editing anyway to remove duplicates like:
[12:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> Scott González
[12:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> scott.gonzalez
[12:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> Timmy Willison
[12:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil
[12:41:40] <DaveMethvin> ah i got it
[12:41:49] <DaveMethvin> that's handy 
[12:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's a mix of git data + trac data.
[12:42:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah i can combine and clean that
[12:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> So, the changelog....this is much easier to parse through with component prefixes ;-)
[12:43:46] <scott_gonzalez> You'll notice it's sorted by commit message.
[12:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> With components, that results in grouping.
[12:44:21] <DaveMethvin> i may fall back to grabbing trac, but for next time we should be in good shape
[12:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's fine.
[12:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> The commit message parsing for ticket references to handle our new format yet anyway.
[12:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> It's till based on "blah blah blah. Fixes #123"
[12:45:17] <scott_gonzalez> But I already filed an issue to update it.
[12:53:52] <timmywil> ok, I think we're good. last test
[12:54:27] <timmywil> I'm doing 1.x first btw
[12:54:46] <DaveMethvin> good call, to ensure latest is 2.x
[12:57:44] <DaveMethvin> grab me the authors and changelog from that when it's done timmywil 
[12:57:55] <timmywil> will do
[12:59:49] <timmywil> Ok, I'm not sure it's creating the archives correctly. I'm just going to go with it though.
[13:00:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's fine
[13:00:08] <DaveMethvin> i can do them manually if needed

[13:02:24] <DaveMethvin> please keep your hands and feet inside the ride at all times

[13:03:47] <DaveMethvin> it's a historical mistake
[13:03:56] <m_gol> maybe we should do what Google did
[13:04:02] <m_gol> leave it as it is and never update
[13:04:03] <DaveMethvin> buy Nest?
[13:04:07] <m_gol> :D
[13:04:07] <DaveMethvin> oh
[13:04:22] <m_gol> they did that for their /1/ jQuery URL
[13:04:29] <timmywil> ah, snag cp: dest file already exists: /Users/timmy/code/jquery-release/__release/codeorigin.jquery.com/cdn/jquery-latest.js
[13:04:34] <timmywil> but I think I can fix this manually
[13:04:41] <timmywil> before it pushes to the cdn
[13:05:15] <m_gol> too late to decide it now so let's push it but IMO we should leave jquery-latest on 1.11.x forever
[13:05:26] <m_gol> it's not that we advertise this URL in any place
[13:05:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'll add to the discussion
[13:06:54] <timmywil> fixed

[13:07:35] <timmywil> completed
[13:07:37] <timmywil> whew
[13:07:43] <DaveMethvin> oh i guess we didn't run in to that before because they were all betas
[13:07:51] <DaveMethvin> and 1.x updates the most files
[13:08:01] <timmywil> yea, probably need some way to force copy those
[13:08:32] <DaveMethvin> or we just leave it as-is from now on as m_gol  said, pros and cons to both
[13:09:31] <timmywil> OK MASTER
[13:10:04] <DaveMethvin> got those author and changelog files for me timmywil ?
[13:10:34] <DaveMethvin> it's amazing how exhausting it can be just running a script ... release days wear me out

[13:25:21] <timmywil> shoot
[13:25:57] <timmywil> well, we can fix that for next time. I TRIED to fix it quick.
[13:26:24] <DaveMethvin> i should be able to pull down the files from the cdn and create the zips from that
[13:26:36] <DaveMethvin> the ms one is easy, it keeps the same name we use
[13:27:07] <DaveMethvin> i just have to edit the map file to point to jquery.js

[14:19:18] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i hope the second one isn't us http://sindresorhus.com/bower-components/
[14:19:37] <timmywil> oh right!
[14:19:42] <timmywil> it's time for that
[14:19:54] <DaveMethvin> what, dinner? :P
[14:20:12] <timmywil> we need to update the registered location for jquery
[14:20:22] <DaveMethvin> ah
[14:20:30] <timmywil> I already have an issue, just need to pull the trigger
[14:20:39] <DaveMethvin> and THEN i can eat dinner?
[14:21:02] <DaveMethvin> they say you gotta stay hungry
[14:25:04] <timmywil> request is in the queue. go eat.
[14:26:05] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: did some test run get pushed up to the bower repo? http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/739bb5.png
[14:27:49] <timmywil> I'm not sure what's going on there.
[14:28:04] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure they can remove it
[14:28:41] <timmywil> depends on how it gets data. It must not be querying the bower registry
[16:46:08] <DaveMethvin> ===> Draft blog post: http://blog.jquery.com/?p=3344&preview=true&preview_id=3344&public=1&nonce=3cc6712b12
[16:47:09] <DaveMethvin> still need to update the download page and a few other things
[16:47:29] <DaveMethvin> list of contributors to come
[16:56:33] <dvpalex> hi everybody
[17:01:40] <snover> DaveMethvin: can you put me as a contributor in every blog post
[17:01:49] <snover> i am contributing positive energy
[17:01:55] <snover> i think i deserve an acknowledgement
[17:02:50] <DaveMethvin> ok updated snover 
[17:03:21] <snover> thanks!
[17:39:00] <snover> DaveMethvin: dojo has the same problem with the package managers
[17:39:29] <snover> oh, add support for nuget! oh, add support for composer! oh, add support for…
[17:39:29] <DaveMethvin> something seems really backwards about it
[17:40:03] <snover> there is a bloody standard, i don’t know why people think they need their own special files
[17:40:15] <DaveMethvin> well there's always a twist of some kind
[17:40:28] <DaveMethvin> not that there NEEDS to be
[17:40:45] <snover> there rarely does. more pertinently, there absolutely does *not* need to be another file that duplicates information that already exists in package.json
[17:40:56] <DaveMethvin> at some point there will be a small number of winners and we can be done with this
[17:40:59] <snover> how many version numbers do we need to keep in sync
[17:40:59] <snover> man
[17:41:00] <snover> you say that
[17:41:03] <snover> but now there is npm drama
[17:41:08] <snover> and i want to kill myself
[17:41:59] <DaveMethvin> with composer though, we just turned that down
[17:42:16] <DaveMethvin> because when you got down to it, we were just creating a file that had shit from elsewhere
[17:42:34] <snover> i think we will be doing bower and npm and that’s it, too
[17:42:44] <DaveMethvin> we're doing those because WE use them
[17:42:48] <DaveMethvin> so that's a reason
[17:42:56] <DaveMethvin> like, we pull in sizzle via bower now
[17:43:08] <snover> i think i like volo more, but volo is more than just package management
[17:43:24] <snover> and i don’t think it will catch on because it’s not as cool as something that is FROM TWITTER OMG
[17:43:55] <DaveMethvin> if it's from a big company it has to be good (tm)
[17:44:14] <DaveMethvin> so ibm wokrs on dojo, it must be REALLY good
[17:44:39] <snover> they’re like…i don’t know what they are doing now
[17:44:49] <snover> they seem to be working on creating their own library now
[17:45:06] <snover> it is kind of bizarre
[17:45:22] <snover> i assume they think that it will be brought back in but uh
[17:45:33] <snover> we’ll see.
[17:45:35] <DaveMethvin> aawwwwkward
[17:46:37] <snover> i’m ok with it. i’m working on some pretty amazing things. it will be a much better library if the people that created certain abominations are no longer allowed to contribute
[17:49:15] <snover> (it’s still REALLY good though.)
