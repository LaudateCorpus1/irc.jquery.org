[02:55:14] <aleph93> Hello, I was wondering if someone could help me get started with contributing to jQuery. I've gone over the articles on the foundation site. I've been using jQuery extensively and have made many apps with it. I'd be elated if I could contribute to it.
[03:12:01] <aleph93> Er, is there some other place I should post this query?
[08:13:13] <ekz> Morning everyone
[08:16:12] <ekz> Anyone got a few minutes for a little code review ?  :-). I wrote a pretty simple responsive widget (it works just fine), but wondering how i could streamline the code
[08:16:26] <ekz> Or apply best jquery practices.
[08:17:04] <ekz> Any takers? :-)
[08:23:51] <ekz> Anyone there?
[08:24:31] <ekz> Pls send me a /msg if you want to take a look, thanks!
