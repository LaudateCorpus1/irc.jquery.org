[07:31:26] <snover> hey scott_gonzalez do you know steve faulkner?
[07:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> I know of him.
[07:33:52] <snover> he just told me to ‚Äúhang out in the real world‚Äù because I spoke up on Twitter about how bad UA support for ARIA is https://twitter.com/stevefaulkner/status/540157277953863680
[07:33:53] <b-ot> snover: @stevefaulkner: @zetafleet come hang out in the real world
[07:35:00] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[07:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, I have the same feeling about jQuery UI widgets.
[07:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> We start by following the ARIA authoring guidelines, then hack the shit out of it until is almost works in some devices, then call it good enough for now.
[07:36:54] <scott_gonzalez> A lot of our widgets just devolve into live regions.
[07:37:14] <scott_gonzalez> And even that needs hacks and still doesn't work that great.
[07:41:03] <snover> I just don‚Äôt even understand how someone at the W3C can tell me I‚Äôm not living in the real world
[07:42:29] <snover> or https://twitter.com/stevefaulkner/status/540156942627659776
[07:42:30] <b-ot> snover: @stevefaulkner: @zetafleet but your griping sounds largely unsubstantiated
[07:46:43] <snover> you‚Äôre the editor of accessibility guidelines for HTML and you think that FIREFOX DOESN‚ÄôT EVEN SUPPORT VOICEOVER ON MAC OS is unsubstantiated griping?!
[07:46:49] <snover> i just don‚Äôt even
[07:58:41] <scott_gonzalez> snover: I should just collect all the commits where we completely swap ARIA implementations.
[08:00:10] <scott_gonzalez> You gotta love stuff like this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/b9e438d07c370ac2d4b198048feb6b6922469f70#diff-ddd333881d221fac0e69c43c144b3668R257
[08:00:55] <snover> scott_gonzalez: anything you can do would be appreciated, if you look at his main twitter stream he took one of my quotes out of context and is apparently making fun of me with bruce lawson
[08:01:14] <snover> super classy
[08:01:44] <snover> i‚Äôd love to dig up similar things in dijit code but i doubt anyone that had been working on it annotated any of the hacks
[08:02:23] <snover> and actually, i suspect a lot of it is just designed to follow the ARIA authoring guidelines, and when it didn‚Äôt work nobody bothered to work around it
[08:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> You'll love the discussion around how navigation of tabs works.
[08:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> It has an appropriate PR #: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/666
[08:03:02] <snover> haha
[08:03:04] <snover> man oh man.
[08:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> This is the big point in the discussion: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/666#issuecomment-6192174
[08:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> I love this part: As soon as VoiceOver is turned on, native tabs switch from delayed activation to manual activation.
[08:05:59] <snover> no big deal i am sure you can detect whether an accessibility device is in use in order to match that behaviour‚Ä¶¬¨
[08:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's really not surprising that everyone just ignores accessibility.
[08:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> It's near impossible to get right, and even if you can get it right, it's near impossible for the average developer to test.
[08:12:16] <snover> i agree completely
[08:13:03] <snover> and, well, if these are the sorts of responses that you get from the people that are supposed to be in charge of accessibility initiatives at the W3C, i don‚Äôt even know what to do to solve the problem except to pull a WHATWG

[12:43:36] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[12:43:45] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[12:44:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I cannot reproduce this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1837#discussion-diff-20456987R187
[12:44:26] <m_gol> I see you were involved in tracking this bug
[12:44:45] <m_gol> I commented out the dest.parentNode check, compiled and IE10 on Win7 in BrowserStack is still failing no tests
[12:45:02] <m_gol> and it should fail the "html() object element #10324" one according to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12132
[12:45:16] <DaveMethvin> they may have slipstreamed in a fix for IE10, does it fail in ie9?
[12:45:23] <m_gol> did MS fix sth in a patch update to IE10? I thought they've started doing these things in IE11
[12:45:40] <m_gol> this particular error was happening in IE10 only per this bug (also, I've checked in IE9 and it's not failing)
[12:47:04] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if we have a unit test for that...
[12:47:18] <DaveMethvin> classid is for <object> elements
[12:47:30] <DaveMethvin> so it might only happen for specific activex objects like flash
[12:48:10] <m_gol> the test I mentioned should cover it
[12:48:16] <m_gol> it has a cloned node without a parent
[12:48:26] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, i think this is the problem with <object> .... <param ... > </object?
[12:48:28] <m_gol> and the OP claimed this test was failing in IE10 before the patch
[12:48:31] <m_gol> yup
[12:48:59] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if they were in IE8 mode or something
[12:49:09] <m_gol> lol
[12:49:29] <DaveMethvin> well if  you can't repro you can't repro i guess
[12:49:33] <m_gol> it's funny what things you discover when you try to drop older browsers...
[12:49:42] <m_gol> maybe we should do it more often ]:->
[12:49:59] <DaveMethvin> oh no doubt there are lots of "here there be dragons" things lying around
[12:50:07] <DaveMethvin> that really have no dragons
[12:51:21] <m_gol> there are a few on master as well :)
[12:51:52] <DaveMethvin> so how did  your thesis defense go m_gol ?
[12:52:02] <m_gol> positive, thanks ;)
[12:52:11] <m_gol> I'm now free to forget everything
[12:52:17] <DaveMethvin> haha yeah
[12:52:50] <m_gol> turns out when you delay the defence by a few years you forget a lot of what was happening on the first few years :P
[12:53:09] <DaveMethvin> gotta make room in your brain for important info like, "how many stylesheets can IE8 handle?"
[12:53:18] <m_gol> :)
[12:54:08] <m_gol> ok, I've confirmed it doesn't throw on outerHTML setter even if parent is null
[12:54:15] <m_gol> so I guess they've fixed it, yay!
[12:54:36] <m_gol> (I hope it won't turn out it's broken only on Vista or sth)
[13:04:26] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: what exactly does "improperly" mean in "IE6-10 improperly clones children of object elements using classid"? no test is failing even in IE8 without this whole block and there are objects with classid tested
[13:05:14] <DaveMethvin> i am not completely sure tbh, i remember the bug but would need to look back at it
[13:05:39] <m_gol> gotta love those detailed comments ;)

[13:07:03] <DaveMethvin> oh i shoulda tested that last one on android 2.x ... let me do that now
[13:07:10] <m_gol> hahaha
[13:07:29] <DaveMethvin> even ie11 was a bit of a pain with it
[13:08:10] <DaveMethvin> but i decided to try and create a real unit test on master rather than have no unit test which we did before
[13:08:21] <m_gol> :)
[13:09:25] <m_gol> it's kinda worrying when you delete workarounds for specific browsers and they still don't fail tests :D

[13:10:52] <DaveMethvin> damn these android 2.3 emulators are S L O W
[13:11:28] <DaveMethvin> well at least my emulator battery is charging
[13:13:58] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: did you try the version on x86?
[13:14:00] <m_gol> it requires some Intel driver
[13:14:15] <m_gol> it's, like, a million times faster than the regular ARM one
[13:14:22] <DaveMethvin> oh!
[13:14:27] <m_gol> I type a letter and it immediately appears, not after 10 seconds
[13:15:22] <DaveMethvin> ok well i should try that ... i was using browserstack
[13:15:25] <m_gol> I couldn't have used it until recently as this driver was causing kernel panics on OS X but they've fixed it
[13:15:32] <m_gol> yeah, they are probably going ARM on that
[13:16:40] <DaveMethvin> yep it is according to the title bar
