[04:10:11] <callumacrae> Hiya! Could this be a thing? https://gist.github.com/callumacrae/ae76940581f5aad0a277
[04:10:35] <callumacrae> It's a pattern I've noticed quite a bit on the site I'm working on atm, don't see any reason why it wouldn't work. Would be interested in contributing

[11:41:11] <m_gol> Krinkle: are you doing sth on the swarm host currently?
[11:41:25] <Krinkle> m_gol: Not really. I was tailing the access log earlier.
[11:41:30] <Krinkle> I'll be deploying in a minute though
[11:41:33] <m_gol> ok
[11:41:41] <m_gol> I added Edge to browsers and wanted to update
[11:42:01] <m_gol> but `sudo puppet agent --test` errored and didn't update what it should, apparently
[11:42:15] <Krinkle> Hm..
[11:42:19] <m_gol> sth on ua-parser
[11:42:35] <m_gol> Error: php external/ua-parser/php/uaparser-cli.php -g returned 1 instead of one of [0]
[11:43:22] <Krinkle> m_gol: What code is doing that?
[11:43:24] <Krinkle> That doesn't exist
[11:43:42] <m_gol> not sure what's happening under the hood, I just invoked `sudo puppet agent --test`
[11:43:46] <Krinkle> OK
[11:43:48] <m_gol> it worked 30 minutes ago :-)
[11:43:48] <Krinkle> I'll check in a bit
[11:43:51] <m_gol> k
[11:44:18] <m_gol> may it be that browserMajor is actually required?...
[11:44:38] <m_gol> I skipped it for Edge as "12" doesn't make sense judging by all communication from Microsoft
[11:45:05] <m_gol> (esp. that BrowserStack specifies version as `0.11`)
[11:50:24] <Krinkle> m_gol: I suspect maybe a jquery commit triggered the outage
[11:50:31] <m_gol> :)
[11:50:36] <Krinkle> something about how inject.js is loaded?
[11:50:58] <Krinkle> Hm.. no recent commits though
[11:52:28] <m_gol> I don't remember anything (I was away for the past week, though)
[11:53:07] <Krinkle> Yeah
[11:53:10] <Krinkle> -infrastructure
[11:54:21] <m_gol> hm?
[12:09:30] <m_gol> Krinkle plz let me know when you deploy
[12:10:07] <Krinkle> m_gol: I'll fix the puppet failure first
[12:10:11] <Krinkle> will be another 30min or so
[12:10:11] <m_gol> k
[12:20:44] <Krinkle> m_gol: Are you blocked on that, or could you do somethig before me?
[12:21:51] <m_gol> Krinkle: it's fine, I'm getting home in a minute. :) It's just that it blocks any future updates; I can try running tests on Edge later

[13:38:31] <Krinkle> m_gol: http://swarm.jquery.org/ Android 2.3 now has a browser icon
[13:38:43] <Krinkle> see the relevant github issues for 4.x and 5.x problems
[13:38:47] <Krinkle> Not sure what browserFamily to use there
[13:38:56] <Krinkle> maybe it different between devices which browser is used by default
[13:39:47] <DaveMethvin> If Android 2.3 was in a family, its family would have thrown it out by now
[13:40:06] <Krinkle> Hehe
[13:40:28] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: It seems Windows 8 and 10 are not part of the Windows family according to ua-parser
[13:40:44] <DaveMethvin> thanks for your work there Krinkle, they just seem to make it harder and harder to tell these browsers apart
[13:40:47] <Krinkle> osFamily: 'Windows 10' osMajor: null
[13:41:24] <DaveMethvin> i understand their hesitance to support browser sniffing but there are valid cases like this

[13:49:36] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Yeah, I mean, if you're using us-parser, the ship has kind of sailed on whether or not you're gonna use it for something.
[13:49:50] <travis-ci> jquery/testswarm#48 (master - 37cf256 Timo Tijhof): The build passed. - https://travis-ci.org/jquery/testswarm/builds/71320819
[13:50:14] <Krinkle> At the very least they could classify it accurately. If someone is gonna use it for "if (ua.os.windows) { alert('Go away'); }" that's not gonna stop them I guess.
[13:50:46] <Krinkle> And ua-parser did follow Microsoft's advice on classifying Edge as a different browser family
[13:51:18] <Krinkle> They approached us (Wikimedia) as well do follow suit in jquery-client.js and make all our ie checks bypass in Edge until we know to do otherwise
[13:51:27] <DaveMethvin> i know it's especially sensitive for microsoft b/c they don't want anyone applying all those inappropriate IE fixes for Edge
[13:51:30] <Krinkle> most of our checks were version bound, but it was a good excercise to audit that.
[13:51:55] <Krinkle> but applying that logic to OS family seems odd. People use Firefox and Chrome on Windows too.
[13:52:19] <Krinkle> I think that's just some weird quirk in how ua-parser works. Not sure why they do it this way for os family of Windows
