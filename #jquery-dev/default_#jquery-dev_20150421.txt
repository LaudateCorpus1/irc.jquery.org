[09:38:12] <m_gol> do we guarantee event bubbling on detached elements?
[09:42:59] <m_gol> because clicks on detached checboxes bubble in Firefox but not in Chrome
[10:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> Can someone with access to the jquery account tweet about http://blog.jquery.com/2015/04/21/announcing-pep-0-3-0/?

[13:03:04] <gibson042> well, I was looking at it after yesterday's mention, and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1411#discussion-diff-22582521 suggests that the complexity is to avoid .pushStack memory leaks instead of the sorting overhead (since the "add" path is in fact explicitly sorting).
[13:03:11] <gibson042> it is also possible to simplify at least the else path (no need for `.get()`), and the if path as well if elements in both collections are attached to a document (older jQuery skipped sorting of disconnected elements): `$( $.unique( current.get().concat( options.element.get() ) ) )` â†’ `$( current.add( options.element ) )`
[13:03:25] <gibson042> and the cost of sorting is roughly equivalent to the cost of deduplication anyway (which makes sense, since deduping is most effective on sorted inputâ€”O(N log N) vs. O(N^2))

[21:46:43] <Krinkle> Hm.. http://sizzlejs.com/ reverted back to old version
[21:46:54] <Krinkle> Or have I been looking at stage for too long
[21:47:37] <Krinkle> Hm.. yeah, http://stage.sizzlejs.com/ looks a bit empty in its sidebar/nav bar
[21:47:42] <arthurvr> Krinkle: It always was like that.
[21:47:54] <arthurvr> the old version I mean. It always was that
[21:48:09] <Krinkle> Yeah
[21:48:10] <arthurvr> and the repo for that site has even been deleted a while ago.
[21:48:32] <Krinkle> The old site was just a single part so there isn't much missing
[21:48:41] <arthurvr> needs cleanup though lol
[21:48:43] <arthurvr> check that markup
[21:48:51] <Krinkle> it's just that the new layout is optimised for a larger site
[21:49:04] <arthurvr> yup
[21:49:36] <Krinkle> hiding the sidebar, and normalising the intro paragraph should make it good enough to publish as-is
[21:49:44] <Krinkle> http://stage.sizzlejs.com/ that is
[21:49:52] <Krinkle> it already has the theme color and HiDPI logo
[21:50:14] <arthurvr> I just landed the hidpi favicons for all sites
[21:50:21] <Krinkle> Yeah
[21:50:25] <Krinkle> that's what brought me there
[21:50:30] <arthurvr> oh
[21:50:33] <arthurvr> awesome :D
