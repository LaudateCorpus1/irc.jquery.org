[13:07:55] <mikesherov> So, this may sound like the dumbest question I ever asked...
[13:08:12] <mikesherov> why would you ever use .attr() over .prop()?
[13:11:19] <gibson042> I think .attr() makes sense if you'll be generating serialized output
[13:11:36] <mikesherov> oh word
[13:11:48] <mikesherov> .attr('style') is a good example I suppose gibson042 
[13:12:48] <mikesherov> thanks
[23:12:44] <m_gol> mikesherov gibson042: also, .attr() can be used to retrieve data-* attribute values
