[05:20:37] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: qunitjs.com (and all other code-related sites) are actually deployed with `npm version build`
[05:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> We have the site versions track the code versions.

[09:03:53] <DaveMethvin> gnarf can you open #jquery-meeting?
[09:05:48] <DaveMethvin> gseguin can you open #jquery-meeting?
[09:10:11] <DaveMethvin> oh well...unfortunately nobody is around to open the channel
[09:13:54] <timmywil> i got it
[09:33:23] <timmywil> gibson042: if it doesn't fail in IE7, it could just be an ID within selector issue in IE8's QSA.
[09:33:43] <timmywil> I don't think we have a test for that
[09:33:45] <gibson042> that's entirely possible
[09:33:54] <gibson042> are you picking it up, then?
[09:34:01] <timmywil> sure
[09:34:27] <gibson042> allright; please let me know if anything weird crops up
[09:34:37] <timmywil> It's IE
[09:34:44] <gibson042> ;)
[09:41:59] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you're listed as an op for #jquery-meeting
[09:42:06] <gnarf> just need to /msg chanserv op #jquery-meeting to get your @
[09:42:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah gnarf i must have typed something wrong
[09:42:31] <DaveMethvin> like my nick :)
[10:13:59] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: You only have to create a git tag and push it, we have a notifier running that automatically deploys the next semver tag
[10:14:17] <Krinkle> Ah nice, npm patch, I didn't know that existed. 
[10:14:23] <Krinkle> I don't have to manually edit it, awesome!
[10:23:17] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: ah, right, my bad
[11:32:55] <timmywil> grr, all my guesses were wrong. gibson042, this only happens in quirksmode
[11:33:13] <gibson042> woohoo, wontfix!
[11:33:17] <timmywil> :)
[11:34:43] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: I noticed that `npm version patch` makes the tag with a "v" prefix, whereas all of our existing tags for the QUnit site do not have "v" prefixes, so I manually revved the version and tagged it myself
[11:34:59] <JamesMGreene> (though I use "v" prefixes for my own repos)
[11:35:18] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Oh? 
[11:35:19] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/tree/v1.11.0-2
[11:35:39] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, which interestingly have non-"v" prefixed versions too if you look at the tags
[11:35:53] <Krinkle> Oh, the npm version, not the tag
[11:36:07] <JamesMGreene> No, the tag
[11:37:13] <JamesMGreene> v1.11.0-2 - 1.11.0-2
[11:37:13] <JamesMGreene> v1.11.0-1 - 1.11.0-1
[11:37:13] <JamesMGreene> 1.11.0-3
[11:37:13] <JamesMGreene> 1.11.0-2
[11:37:13] <JamesMGreene> 1.11.0-1
[11:37:28] <JamesMGreene> All under: https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/tags
[11:40:20] <Krinkle> Yeah, there's duplicates
[11:40:25] <Krinkle> Let's delete the odd ones
[11:48:52] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: I've deleted them for com and api.com
[11:49:11] <JamesMGreene> ok, thanks
[11:49:58] <JamesMGreene> BTW, what's the rationale behind having separate websites for the API pages? I'm guessing they're generated differently than the main content or something, right?
[11:54:27] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: Don't manually change versions. Always use `npm version` to deploy.

[17:57:02] <Krinkle> Interesting, github-compare supports time codes
[17:57:07] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/compare/master%40%7B1day%7D...master
[17:57:22] <Krinkle> @{1day}
[17:57:47] <Krinkle> Found out through a tip on this page: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/compare/v1.11.0..master
[17:57:47] <Krinkle> Anyone know whether this (and perhaps other tricks with github-compare) are documented?
[18:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Most URL features in GitHub are blog-documented only.
[18:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> They are the king of hidden features :-/
[18:24:25] <Krinkle> https://www.google.com/search?q=compare+time+site:github.com+inurl%3A%22.com%2Fblog%22
[18:24:31] <Krinkle> haven't found any blog post about it
[18:25:25] <Krinkle> nothing in the original post either https://github.com/blog/612-introducing-github-compare-view
[18:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Well, you're not going to find anything about time comparisons.
[18:30:47] <scott_gonzalez> That's a git feature
[18:31:08] <Krinkle> aha
[18:31:10] <Krinkle> of course it is
[18:31:24] <Krinkle> and they just pass it on
[18:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[18:31:29] <Krinkle> to their implementation of git
