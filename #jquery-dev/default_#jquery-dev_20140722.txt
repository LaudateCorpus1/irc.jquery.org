[10:09:25] <JamesMGreene> leobalter: Sounds good to me
[10:11:29] <JamesMGreene> leobalter Krinkle|detached jzaefferer: BTW, any idea why our browserstack.json is only configured to run the "index.html" test suite rather than all 4 of the suites?

[10:28:11] <leobalter> JamesMGreene I think it doesn't take multiple html files.

[10:44:21] <leobalter> JamesMGreene: it's always sad to close PRs without merging, but that was necessary to close.
[10:44:37] <JamesMGreene> Yeah
[10:44:43] <JamesMGreene> That one just didn't make sense IMHO
[10:44:50] <JamesMGreene> [for Core]
[10:45:06] <JamesMGreene> leobalter: No, browserstack-runner can handle multiple files
[10:45:12] <JamesMGreene> I use it as such for QUnit locally
[10:45:19] <JamesMGreene> I'll send a PR for it
[10:45:22] <leobalter> nice
[10:46:27] <leobalter> if that was the only issue with browserstack-runner, we can probably land this soon
[10:47:45] <JamesMGreene> Hey leobalter: Can you point me in the right directions as far as assessing PRs #577 and #607?
[10:51:20] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15JamesMGreene opened pull request #608: Build: Updating BrowserStack config to run all test pages (06master...06browserstack_updates) 02http://git.io/BjV6jw
[10:53:15] <leobalter> JamesMGreene: 577 is not necessary to merge at this moment, but #607 does a reference to something I discussed with jzaefferer there. 
[10:53:45] <JamesMGreene> So is #577 for v2.0.0?
[10:53:50] <JamesMGreene> and #607 is pre-v2.0.0?
[10:53:50] <leobalter> yes
[10:54:01] <leobalter> yes, yes :)
[10:54:06] <JamesMGreene> gotcha, thanks
[10:54:21] <leobalter> I broke the backwards compatibility in a previous PR, when I did that Assert instantiation stuff
[10:54:22] <JamesMGreene> I'll add milestones to them so at least I am less confused without reading the whole discussion :-P
[10:54:58] <leobalter> #607 addresses the fixes for that backwards compatibility
[10:56:34] <JamesMGreene> Right
[10:56:43] <JamesMGreene> Thanks for rebasing
[10:59:26] <leobalter> #607 rebase (after #603 merge) was surprisingly smooth and without conflicts
[11:08:14] <JamesMGreene> Definitely looks like a JSHint bug with globals
[11:08:18] <JamesMGreene> weird
[13:24:53] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: No idea why browserstack.json is the way it is.
[13:24:57] <Krinkle> I've actually never used it
[13:25:30] <Krinkle> browserstack-launcher is quite nice for standalone (limited, but good for the common case)
[13:25:48] <Krinkle> I'd rather have something more integrated via Grunt though.
[14:10:48] <leobalter> Krinkle|detached: browsertack-runner is good, but exclusive for those with accounts. It will be better when possible to attach that on Travis tests (we can do that through npm ci script, grunt is not necessary).
[14:12:38] <leobalter> We're still waiting browserstack to support TravisCI for open source accounts, but it's good to run 14 extra browser tests from cli
