[07:41:19] <defaultro> good morning folks, I have basic javascript foundation. I would like to ask if you can provide links to tutorials even professor led training. I was told this but not sure if it's going to be too advance for me, http://training.bocoup.com/comprehensive-jquery/
[09:17:24] <bharath> I am new to jquery development , can anyone suggest some good first bug to work on?
[09:39:03] <gibson042> bharath: I can't think of any offhand, but the links for this channel provide a good starting point
[09:39:26] <gibson042> in particular, the tickets with owner: anonymous are up for grabs
[09:40:56] <gibson042> bharath: it might also be a good idea to setup notifications for all new tickets
