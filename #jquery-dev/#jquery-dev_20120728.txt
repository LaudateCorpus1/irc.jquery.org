[03:28:51] <jqcommit> [testswarm] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/_taLbA
[03:28:51] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Fix font-size in bootstrap.css to avoid weird margin errors in IE8. Might get rid of CSS on run page or of the run page itself eventually, but for now this is useful - Jörn Zaefferer
[03:30:05] <jzaefferer> ?tell Krinkle gnarf I've commited that bootstrap.css fix to restore our testswarm instance to a regular checkout from master. Can still get rid of the CSS on the run page or the run page itself later
[03:30:05] <b-ot> jzaefferer, I’ll tell Krinkle about that.
[03:49:30] <gnarf> coo
[03:49:41] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i was hoping to find someplace other than bootstrap.css to put that ;)
[03:52:04] <jzaefferer> gnarf: right, but until we get rid of that iframe, might as well patch it there
[03:52:15] <jzaefferer> now we just need to fix that jquery-git/IE9/effects failure...
[03:52:36] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah - no clue wtf is happening there
[03:52:39] <gnarf> it never happens on rerun
[03:52:58] <gnarf> and the error message is beyond useless
[03:54:21] <jzaefferer> gnarf: have you tried increasing reruns?
[03:54:42] <gnarf> i think its set at 2
[03:54:45] <gnarf> but no
[03:54:48] <gnarf> feel free
[03:58:15] <jzaefferer> increased to five for now
[03:58:51] <jzaefferer> gnarf: this job is running way too many tests: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20UI%20-%201.6.x%20core/36/console
[03:59:57] <jzaefferer> looks like the config changed since that run though
[04:00:54] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah
[04:01:00] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i made a 1.6 1.7 and git one
[04:02:21] <jzaefferer> okay
[04:02:48] <jzaefferer> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/418 - doesn't look like the rerun thing works
[04:03:18] <jzaefferer> but I'm also not sure how to tell if it tried to rerun or not
[04:03:32] <jzaefferer> actually
[04:03:37] <jzaefferer> homepage had one pending rerun
[04:03:40] <jzaefferer> now its fixed
[04:05:43] <jzaefferer> but now stuck with four in progress runs that don't seem to finish...

[06:07:27] <M1k1> hi
[06:07:28] <M1k1> the fadein effect set in sec looks like 5000 why too speed?
[11:48:57] <FJ1> somebody here? i have a problem when i combine http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8rc1.js and http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.9.0-beta.1/jquery-ui.js and use "sortable".. i'm not shure if it is a jquery or a ui problem.. or my code :-/
[11:51:14] <shoky> FJ1: jquery 1.9b1 works with jquery 1.7.2 or below
[11:51:48] <shoky> *jquery ui 1.9b1
[11:54:12] <FJ1> yes with 1.7.2 it works all ok. that means jquery ui 1.9 will not be compatible with jquery 1.8?
[11:56:11] <FJ1> i just want help. that's why i tested my stuff with the newest releases/betas.
[11:56:30] <shoky> jquery ui 1.9 will be. 1.9b1 however, not
[11:57:00] <FJ1> ok. it works also not with http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js
[11:57:04] <shoky> you want help so you tested with non-stable releases?
[12:01:32] <FJ1> ok. i dont' test now… but if the bug still there after the release.. i don't want to read a fucking Post on jquery blog where they cry "Nothing makes us sadder than finishing up a release and only then seeing a report of a serious bug that could have been fixed earlier."
[12:07:40] <shoky> FJ1: note that i am not a dev or any authority on the matter..
