[04:27:40] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on testswarm by Krinkle (14h, 42m ago): Expand README
[04:28:39] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: okay, good to land then
[04:28:39] <bot-t> (14 hours 10 mins ago) <Krinkle-away> tell jzaefferer I've addressed the issues you left comments on, and packed it up in a pull request. I can pull it, but I'd rather have you check it and pull it https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/pull/123
[04:28:40] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on testswarm by Krinkle (14h, 18m ago): Many improvements
[04:29:31] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Would you be so kind to push "Merge pull request" then? I"m afraid to push my commits to my github fork as it might be injected into the pull request.
[04:29:52] <Krinkle> I should create a new branch locally I know.. I'm a lazy git noob
[04:34:21] <jzaefferer> well, testing locally now
[04:34:24] <Krinkle> OK
[04:34:42] <jzaefferer> should rename to testswarm-sample.ini
[04:35:16] <jzaefferer> this is wrong: "Set debug[show_exception_details] = 1; at the bottom of testswarm.ini to show detailed debugging information."
[04:35:29] <jzaefferer> should be
[04:35:30] <jzaefferer> [debug]
[04:35:30] <jzaefferer> 	show_exception_details = 1
[04:35:36] <Krinkle> Right
[04:35:46] <Krinkle> Did you get an exception?
[04:35:57] <Krinkle> (I agree on both)
[04:37:16] <jzaefferer> yeah, the stack helps
[04:37:35] <jzaefferer> now I'm getting problems with rewrites again :/
[04:37:44] <jzaefferer> [Thu Mar 22 12:37:10 2012] [error] [client 127.0.0.1] Request exceeded the limit of 10 internal redirects due to probable configuration error. Use 'LimitInternalRecursion' to increase the limit if necessary. Use 'LogLevel debug' to get a backtrace.
[04:38:00] <jzaefferer> must have messed up my apache config badly
[04:38:05] <Krinkle> Hm..
[04:38:27] <jzaefferer> got that two days ago on something else, too
[04:39:04] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: So locally I've made several commits to my master that I don't want to push to github yet. Can I create a new branch based on the remote master to make a quick fix that I'll push?
[04:39:24] <jzaefferer> yeah, sure
[04:39:28] <Krinkle> if not, I'll just make a separate new clone in a different directory and do it there
[04:39:44] <jzaefferer> checkout -b hotfix origin/master
[04:40:04] <Krinkle> So to store my local master branch temporarily and ...
[04:40:15] <Krinkle> OK, let's see what it does
[04:40:25] <Krinkle> I figured it would be like that but couldn't figure out the syntax
[04:40:46] <Krinkle> checkout -b is short for creating a branch and checking it out ? or should I create it first.
[04:41:09] <jzaefferer> you should be able to update thr PR from master to thatbranch
[04:42:18] <Krinkle> nice
[04:42:29] <jzaefferer> we should also remove the discussion and twitter links in the header
[04:42:46] <Krinkle> Lets first get this PR landed :)
[04:43:07] <jzaefferer> and strip that logo to just "TeestSwarm"
[04:44:36] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Is there an SVG or EPS template somewhere for jQuery style logos? Like the orange jUI and green QUnit have
[04:44:49] <Krinkle> I've got pretty good skills in Illustrator so should be able to make that nice :)
[04:45:27] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: so to push the commit I just made to hotfix to github, just 'git push' will do? Or should I specify that I don't want to push the master branch
[04:45:50] <Krinkle> (I know it could be named something other than hotfix, I just kept the name you used as example)
[04:50:13] <Krinkle> oh, now I've pushed the entire branch to github :D
[04:50:19] <Krinkle> `git push origin hot fix`
[04:50:22] <Krinkle> `git push origin hotfix`
[04:51:43] <Krinkle> Ah http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5423517/how-do-i-push-a-local-git-branch-to-master-branch-in-the-remote
[04:51:46] <Krinkle> Love you SO :)
[04:54:12] <jzaefferer> add -u to setup tracking
[04:54:29] <jzaefferer> so git pull will know what to do
[04:54:43] <jzaefferer> also I finally got this logged:
[04:54:44] <jzaefferer> 127.0.0.1 - - [22/Mar/2012:12:53:22 +0100] [localhost/sid#10080d720][rid#1009e1908/initial/redir#10] (2) [perdir /] trying to replace prefix / with /
[04:55:34] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: can you dump (parts of) your .ini and .htaccess for me?
[04:57:52] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: https://gist.github.com/82806edc8cf446d324cc
[04:58:23] <Krinkle> shouldn't matter, but try to remove the trailing slash from RewriteBase
[04:58:50] <jzaefferer> ok
[04:59:16] <Krinkle> Did you mean to comment out "RewriteRule (.*[^/])$ $1/ [R=301,QSA]" ?
[05:00:32] <jzaefferer> added the full rewritelog: https://gist.github.com/82806edc8cf446d324cc#file_rewritelog
[05:00:55] <jzaefferer> ah, meant to undo that
[05:01:27] <Krinkle> multiple files in a gist? Wow, I'm so out of date on github features
[05:02:57] <Krinkle> did that fix it?
[05:03:07] <jzaefferer> nope
[05:03:18] <jzaefferer> any idea what this is doing? RewriteRule ^.*$ - [S=51]
[05:04:09] <Krinkle> disallows viewing of .* files just in case
[05:04:27] <Krinkle> other than .ini that is
[05:04:36] <Krinkle> .git stuff
[05:04:59] <Krinkle> .htaccess and .git stuff
[05:05:13] <Krinkle> I'm also on a Mac
[05:05:15] <Krinkle> works here
[05:05:15] <Krinkle> weird
[05:05:33] <jzaefferer> this is bad: 'Users/jza/dev/testswarm/login/' -> '/index.php'
[05:05:42] <Krinkle> Why ?
[05:05:42] <jzaefferer> next it tries Users/jza/dev/index.php
[05:05:52] <Krinkle> everything is handled by index.php
[05:05:53] <jzaefferer> should be Users/jza/dev/testswarm/index.php
[05:05:57] <Krinkle> oh
[05:06:38] <Krinkle> http://localhost/testswarm/login/ works fine here
[05:06:43] <Krinkle> How are you accessing it?
[05:07:08] <Krinkle> "Users/jza/dev/testswarm/login/" shouldn't be requested afaik
[05:07:20] <Krinkle> it should be rewritten before it maps it to a file path
[05:11:08] <jzaefferer> accessing via http://localhost:82/testswarm/login/
[05:11:26] <Krinkle> did it work before via port 82?
[05:11:59] <jzaefferer> it works at /testswarm
[05:12:15] <jzaefferer> its just the folder rewrites that fail
[05:12:31] <Krinkle> does both ./testswam and ./testswarm/ work ?
[05:12:41] <Krinkle> (trailing slash)
[05:12:41] <jzaefferer> this works: http://localhost:82/testswarm/?state=login
[05:12:46] <Krinkle> ok
[05:13:35] <Krinkle> Can you try installing tag v0.2.0 of testswarm?
[05:14:56] <jzaefferer> nevermind, found the issue
[05:15:37] <jzaefferer> AllowOverride in the wrong <Directory>...
[05:18:02] <jzaefferer> landing the PR now
[05:18:11] <Krinkle> Thx
[05:18:29] <Krinkle> I'll admit I've never debugged apache with a smile on my face
[05:18:42] <jzaefferer> btw when you rename files, use `git mv`
[05:18:42] <Krinkle> to say the least :P
[05:18:45] <Krinkle> I do
[05:18:47] <Krinkle> always
[05:18:56] <jzaefferer> mhm
[05:19:46] <jzaefferer> okay, then its just the cli diff that fails to show that properly
[05:20:13] <Krinkle> ok
[05:21:53] <jzaefferer> btw even if you land your own PR, don't use github for that
[05:22:16] <jzaefferer> creates merge commits where a fast-forward would work
[05:22:35] <davidmurdoch> Any chance jQuery will host a source-map for the latest jQuery versions on code.jquery.com soon/eventually? There's an uglify JS branch that supports source-mapping on github
[05:23:47] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: landed
[05:23:53] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: fast forward the original repo to fork? Interesting. It makes perfect since since there is no "central" or "original" marking, it works either way. Just hadn't looked at it that way (I fast-forward the other way often)
[05:24:01] <jzaefferer> next commit should also get notified here
[05:24:03] <Krinkle> I'll do that :)
[05:24:47] <jzaefferer> davidmurdoch: got some links?
[05:25:19] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: lets close https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/pull/81 ?

[05:27:38] <jzaefferer> yeah, whatever :p
[05:27:44] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: fine by me, we'll have to redo that either way
[05:28:21] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, I've been going through the https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/forkqueue past 30 minutes to see if there's some interesting stuff
[05:28:28] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Someone experimented with using Twitter Bootstrap as UI
[05:28:33] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Someone experimented with using Twitter Bootstrap as UI framework
[05:28:44] <Krinkle> I haven't cloned it to see for myself, but that seems like a good idea
[05:28:47] <Krinkle> what do you think?
[05:29:24] <jzaefferer> can you fetch it and make a screenshot?
[05:31:12] <Krinkle> The edge case decisions could be discussed, but I mean in general using Bootstrap as design
[05:31:14] <Krinkle> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/
[05:31:40] <Krinkle> A bit like JSHint
[05:31:54] <Krinkle> (which is a stock bootstrap layout)

[05:54:37] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on testswarm by jayarjo (4w, 4h ago): Fixed "Add Job" interface
[05:54:55] <Krinkle> stores the user auth in the session, and when addjob POSTs it gets the auth from session if not submitted
[05:55:24] <jzaefferer> nice
[05:55:33] <Krinkle> xD
[06:04:21] <jzaefferer> so Krinkle, what are the next steps?
[06:04:33] <Krinkle> Locally I'm working on 2 projects
[06:04:40] <Krinkle> 3 actually
[06:04:41] <Krinkle> - Context
[06:04:43] <Krinkle> - API
[06:04:52] <Krinkle> - Page/Action
[06:05:13] <Krinkle> I'll finish them in the order: Context, Page/Action, API
[06:05:40] <Krinkle> Context was finished yesterday but haven't pushed yet
[06:06:10] <Krinkle> Page/Action is a small refactor of ./content and ./logic, to clean it up so that actions can be re-used in the API later
[06:06:57] <Krinkle> Page/Action also normalizes the url structure to use only action= and id= (optional)
[06:07:19] <Krinkle> `id` could be better named `arg` or `item`
[06:07:37] <Krinkle> action=jobstatus&item=123, action=tinder&item=jquery etc.
[06:07:48] <Krinkle> makes rewriting easier as well
[06:08:42] <Krinkle> after that I'm done for this week, and I'll probably be quiet for a another few weeks (aside form the occasional bug fix I find when using the new goodies for MediaWiki unit testing)
[06:10:03] <Krinkle> Context pushed
[06:11:35] <Krinkle> jzaefferer:
[06:12:09] <melter> does anyone know if we're going to see a new plugin.jquery.com?
[06:14:22] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Context is in the history of my fork now: https://github.com/Krinkle/testswarm/commits/
[06:15:44] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: good plan. Looking forward to the API
[06:15:53] <Krinkle> me too
[06:16:37] <Krinkle> I would like to make it according to some kind of standard but I'm not sure if there's any good one that is appropriate for us
[06:16:45] <Krinkle> RESTful seems nice
[06:17:13] <Krinkle> using headers instead of the query itself to determine the output format
[06:17:23] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I'm not seeing anything after the merge commit
[06:17:23] <Krinkle> anything to shorten the query command
[06:17:31] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: it got into the history
[06:17:31] <jzaefferer> what am I missing?
[06:17:36] <Krinkle> scroll down
[06:17:54] <jzaefferer> whats the commit message(s)?

[06:20:07] <scott_gonzalez> melter: Yes, it's coming soon.
[06:20:32] <scott_gonzalez> melter: http://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com
[06:24:48] <melter> scott_gonzalez: is that all it's going to be? just a github page?
[06:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> Umm...no. Not at all.
[06:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> Does it look like a GitHub page?
[06:25:42] <Krinkle> melter: that is a link to the source code of the plugins site being worked on, that link isn't the actual plugins site
[06:26:16] <Krinkle> :D
[06:26:40] <melter> Krinkle: thanks
[06:26:50] <Krinkle> bot-t1 has been acting up lately
[06:26:53] <Krinkle> you're welcome

[10:11:58] <gibson042> .
[10:58:22] <JMM> I filed a bug report against jQuery 1.4.4 (http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7891) that was unceremoniously marked as invalid, with no followup discussion (my last post was never replied to). I just revisited the issue and updated the jsfiddle testcases to jQuery 1.5.2 and that makes them work as expected...
[10:58:42] <JMM> So even though the report was marked invalid, the behavior of jQuery.blur() / jQuery.focus() that I reported about appears to have changed between 1.4.4 and 1.5.2. I'm curious what changes were made that result in the different behavior and I'm hoping someone can comment on that. Is there a related ticket? I skimmed release notes for intervening versions and didn't spot anything re: this.
[11:00:06] <jqcommit> [testswarm] Krinkle pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/a8JSNQ

[11:50:16] <gagarine> hello for jquery 1.7 how can I overwrite attr to make it compatible with property?
[11:50:21] <gagarine> Like in 1.6.1
[12:38:32] <snover> gagarine: this is not the support channel.
[13:01:59] <gagarine> snover oups.. my IRC client didn't show the complete description of the channel...
[13:02:22] <gagarine> thanks to notify me of my mistake
[13:47:14] <phuff> If I'm deep in the jquery internals trying to understand how things work is this the right place to ask a question or would #jquery be better?
[13:47:42] <phuff> :)
[13:50:56] <eddiemonge> #jquery would be better unless you are changing those internals for some reason
[13:54:12] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: phuff if you don't get any answer there you can re-ask in here, better chances of getting a good answer here :p
[13:54:23] <phuff> Heh heh
[13:54:38] <phuff> I figured I'd probably get a better answer here :)
[13:54:48] <phuff> But I didn't want to pester
[13:54:52] <eddiemonge> depends on if im answering in #jquery or not ;)
[13:54:57] <phuff> Ha ha
[15:45:18] <eddiemonge> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11506
[15:46:48] <ajpiano> i think we know about that already
[15:47:08] <ajpiano> i believe it's a temporary thing
[15:57:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I told Dan about that last week.
[15:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> Though we should fix jquery.com too.
[15:59:25] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess that's really two issues.
[15:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> 1) The redirect is gone.
[15:59:44] <scott_gonzalez> 2) Why are we still linking to a URL that changed forever ago?
[16:05:05] <ajpiano> 2. donno
[16:05:17] <ajpiano> seems that it would be pretty straightforward to just fix that in the few places it exists
[16:05:26] <ajpiano> waiting for new sites for that is silly
[16:06:39] <eddiemonge> yup, id fix it but i no longer have access
[16:06:54] <eddiemonge> sold my laptop and wiped the other one that had access
[16:07:05] <eddiemonge> i suppose i could dig my key out of timemachine
[16:08:47] <ajpiano> i think we can probably get it straightened :p
