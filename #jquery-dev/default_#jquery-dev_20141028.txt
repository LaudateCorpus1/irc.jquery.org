[07:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> Reminder: DST has ended in Europe but not the US. Double check the times for any meetings you have this week.
[07:25:45] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: fortunately I remembered that for the Core meeting yesterday ;)
[07:25:49] <m_gol> this time
[07:25:51] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:26:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I was a day late on the reminder.
[07:26:22] <scott_gonzalez> I thought about it over the weekend and then forgot about it yesterday.
