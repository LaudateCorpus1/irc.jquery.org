[12:03:51] <jzaefferer> leobalter: does that make sense?
[12:04:22] <jzaefferer> leobalter: I mean, if you can get node-qunit running on 1.20 in a few minutes or hours, nevermind. If not, my plan might be more attractive
[12:05:24] <leobalter> QUnit 2 will draw a lot of attention
[12:05:29] <leobalter> because it'll be a major release
[12:05:52] <leobalter> so it's the best opportunity to get the interest from node users as well
[12:07:16] <leobalter> if we get node-qunit back working and land the QUnit.reporter before QUnit 2, we'll be able to do this
[12:08:16] <Krinkle> leobalter: node-qunit
[12:08:31] <Krinkle> leobalter: Do you see a realistic/feasible path in which node-qunit becomes redundant?
[12:08:45] <Krinkle> We've done a lot toward node compatibility in recent releases.
[12:09:03] <Krinkle> I'm hoping we can make it redundant and reduce it to a cli reporter.
[12:09:13] <gibson042> +1 Krinkle
[12:09:35] <Krinkle> The main features we'll need to revise is code loading, which seems to be the only thing it does that is beyond plain QUnit.
[12:10:05] <leobalter> Krinkle: node-qunit is still useful as a cli tool
[12:10:48] <Krinkle> It doesn't ship with an executable though, right? So you'd always be invoking your own file that contains require('qunit');
[12:10:51] <leobalter> my idea is to import node-qunit work on the cli 
[12:11:18] <leobalter> no? I though we was usable as an executable
[12:11:23] <leobalter> like: qunit files.js
[12:11:34] <Krinkle> I'm curious how much we'll need if we instead have our idom be: test/index.js: require(qunitjs)
[12:11:35] <leobalter> if it does not work that way, there isn't much to do 
[12:11:46] <Krinkle> And then import the js files and test suites and register the cli reporter.
[12:12:15] <Krinkle> There is somethign to be said about having test suites execute in a shared global context, which I think it does (not 100% sure)
[12:12:19] <Krinkle> it has a 'namespace' option
[12:12:43] <Krinkle> Our update is not going to be a drop-in replacement, and I don't think it should be, so we can consider approaching it from a different perspective
[12:12:49] <Krinkle> I agree though, a qunit-cli sounds interesting
[12:12:51] <Krinkle> similar to mocha
[12:13:24] <Krinkle> I suppose for testing in node, you wouldn't need to include source files first, since the tests will already require() what they need themselves
[12:14:30] <Krinkle> Although right now the nice thing is that one can have the same test suite run in a browser and node-qunit
[12:14:43] <Krinkle> without browserify
[12:15:01] <Krinkle> I use that pattern quite a lot, e.g. https://github.com/wikimedia/oojs/blob/master/tests/node-index.js
[12:18:21] <leobalter> that's nice
[12:20:00] <leobalter> We are really close to say QUnit is ready for node. 
[12:21:21] <leobalter> from all the developers I talk about testing tools, their feedback is always they would use QUnit if it works out of the box on node. Chai would be a plus, but that's another story
[12:24:18] <Krinkle> https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-qunit/issues/24#issuecomment-77939712
[12:24:26] <Krinkle> Karma is short on resources
[12:24:46] <Krinkle> In my experience most plugins are unmaintained. Core is maintained, but could be better.
[12:25:02] <Krinkle> Could we potentially have a sprint to help out and/or reduce that layer a bit?
