[01:53:37] <ythej> anyone available??
[02:05:57] <hiren_> Hey all
[02:06:23] <hiren_> I wanted to fix some minor bug to get familiar with code
[02:06:46] <ythej> think no one is online :)
[02:06:48] <hiren_> Can anyone suggest from where i can find it?
[02:07:57] <ythej> hiren_, I am also a newbie in this org as you :P
[04:09:39] <arschmitz> ythej: hiren_: Hi how can i help you?
[04:10:12] <ythej> arschmitz, I am willing to take part in GSOC 2015 through JQUERY. I have already gone through the idea's list of jQuery foundation.
[04:10:34] <ythej> arschmitz, My skills are JS, HTML, CSS and I am well aware of unit testing and integration tests.
[04:10:56] <arschmitz> ythej: ok
[04:10:56] <ythej> arschmitz, I am interested in contributing some bug on jQuery to get comfortable with the code base. 
[04:11:17] <arschmitz> ythej: all the current open bugs can be found in the issue tracker
[04:11:29] <arschmitz> which task / project were you interested in
[04:11:42] <mavihs> Hi folks
[04:11:42] <ythej> arschmitz, can you help me with the pointer
[04:12:13] <arschmitz> ythej: if you can give me an idea which project or task your interested in i can point you in the right direction
[04:12:16] <arschmitz> mavihs: hi
[04:12:39] <ythej> arschmitz, yeah, one sec please
[04:12:55] <mavihs> I'm interested in contributing to qUnit in Google Summer Of Code.
[04:13:06] <mavihs> For the project - " Better diff output"
[04:13:58] <mavihs> How can I start contributing to fix bugs so that I can get idea of codebase?
[04:14:12] <arschmitz> mavihs: jzaefferer and leobalter are the qunit mentors so they will be able to provide better help there then i can but here is some background info and issues for that one https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/335 https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/364 https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/363
[04:14:25] <ythej> arschmitz, there are many projects in which I can do
[04:14:51] <ythej> arschmitz, I couldn't decide the exact project
[04:14:56] <arschmitz> mavihs: you can see a list of all open qunit bugs here https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues
[04:15:04] <mavihs> arschmitz: Thanks. I'm going through it.
[04:15:24] <arschmitz> ythej: well each of the different projects / tasks have different mentors and the code is in different repositories etc
[04:15:33] <ythej> arschmitz, (for information, I have been contributing Firefox OS from long time. can you please tell according to that ?)
[04:15:54] <arschmitz> ythej: so with out having some idea what your interested in i cant really point you in the right direction
[04:16:12] <arschmitz> ythej: most of the tasks require the same basic skill sets JS/HTML/CSS 
[04:16:22] <arschmitz> ythej: so its really about what you want to work on
[04:16:29] <ythej> arschmitz, yeah, I see that :)
[04:16:42] <mavihs> Hi jzaefferer and leobalter :)
[04:16:58] <ythej> arschmitz, I will decide it and come back to you :)
[04:17:31] <ythej> arschmitz, on what time zone this channel will be active ?
[04:19:27] <arschmitz> ythej: we have team members all over the world
[04:19:50] <arschmitz> ythej: though for most of th tasks you would want the channel specific to that project
[04:20:19] <arschmitz> the most active time tends to be 9-5 EST monday - friday but there is almost always someone around
[04:20:47] <ythej> arschmitz, okay, thank you :)
[04:27:31] <arschmitz> ythej: no problem
[04:28:36] <ythej> arschmitz, can you help me with more requirements of scijs ? 
[04:29:26] <ythej> arschmitz, I am not very much aware of c++ !
[04:29:50] <arschmitz> ythej: thats probably the one i'm least familiar with so i probably cant help much with that one and i have not written c++ in like 7 years lol 
[04:29:55] <arschmitz> ythej: but ill answer what i can
[04:30:31] <ythej> arschmitz, hmm :)
[04:31:24] <ythej> arschmitz, Chassis - Styling Components for JS Libraries ??
[04:31:43] <ythej> arschmitz, (sorry if I am troubling you so much :))
[04:33:33] <arschmitz> ythej: no problem #css-chassis is the channel for that one you can see one related issue here https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/6
[04:33:45] <arschmitz> ythej: my self or sfrisk can help you with that issue
[04:34:14] <ythej> arschmitz, cool :)
[04:34:28] <ythej> I will join the channel :)
[04:46:46] <ujjwal> hi, I would like to work on gsoc project - better testing infrastructure
[04:49:08] <ujjwal> can some one help in getting started, first task to begin with this project
[05:01:49] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15jzaefferer closed issue #757: assert.greaterThan() and assert.lesserThan() needed? 02http://git.io/x2lz
[05:04:51] <ythej> arschmitz, what does jQuery mobile use for unit testing?
[05:05:04] <arschmitz> ythej: qunit
[05:05:30] <ythej> ythej, okay :)
[05:08:13] <ythej> arschmitz, can I find some docs on performance testing?
[05:08:35] <arschmitz> ythej: we dont do performance testing currently
[05:08:53] <arschmitz> though its something im currently working on
[05:09:06] <ythej> arschmitz, jQuery Mobile - Prototype JavaScript transition module -> Its mention in here
[05:09:30] <arschmitz> ythej: yes the setup for that is still being made
[05:09:53] <arschmitz> im working on it for chassis right now and once its finalized there i will be bringing it to jquery ui and mobile
[05:13:00] <ythej> arschmitz, do we really need to have basic understanding of performance testing for this project ?
[05:14:40] <arschmitz> to complete it yes to start it no. However a good grasp on what things effect performance would be needed
[05:15:39] <ythej> arschmitz, I would back to you in some
[05:15:59] <ythej> arschmitz, I still searching to find a interesting project !
[05:31:47] <mavihs> what's the url of devel mailing list of qunit?
[05:51:37] <ujjwal> gsoc project - better testing infrastructure's mentors around?
[05:55:18] <jzaefferer> ujjwal: markelog__ is the mentor for that
[05:55:34] <jzaefferer> mavihs: QUnit doesn't have a mailing list
[05:56:02] <mavihs> jzaefferer: okay, so all the communication happens on IRC?
[05:56:27] <markelog__> .
[05:57:08] <mavihs> jzaefferer: I'm interested in the project - "Better diff output"
[05:57:19] <mavihs> I'm going through the source code
[05:58:27] <jzaefferer> mavihs: IRC and GitHub issues
[06:00:01] <ythej> arschmitz, jQuery Mobile - Switch library to use pointerevents -> I want to work on this.
[06:01:08] <mavihs> okay. Is jsdiff already implemented for qUnit as mentioned in #364?
[06:16:33] <arschmitz> ythej: that one is not quite ready yet its waiting on a es3 compatible release of PEP https://github.com/jquery/pep

[06:57:08] <hayataadil> hey 
[06:58:18] <hayataadil> anyone there ?
[07:04:07] <jacquerie> hayataadil: I think you should just ask your question. Eventually someone will come and answer it.
[07:10:19] <hayataadil> ???
[07:13:38] <arschmitz> hayataadil: can i help you
[07:14:26] <hayataadil> I wanted to know details about proposed gsoc 15 project : better testing infrastructure
[07:16:24] <hayataadil> involving removing of the php dependency 
[08:34:13] <hayataadil> hey ?
[08:36:23] <Caper> http://jsfiddle.net/3d6fbLbe/27/
[08:36:35] <Caper> i got some error on drop time while drop module over module
[08:36:41] <Caper> https://unsee.cc/zugonisa/
[08:36:49] <Caper> like drop Menu the User on it then device on user when you drop again any module in First menu you see the error
[08:37:11] <arthurvr> Caper: support questions in #jquery please
[08:42:04] <hayataadil> anyone ??
[08:43:04] <arthurvr> hayataadil: hi!
[08:43:11] <arthurvr> hayataadil: anything I can help you with?
[08:47:31] <hayataadil> i needed some info abt proposed gsoc project on better infrastructure testing 
[08:47:43] <hayataadil> replacing php with node.js
[08:48:38] <arschmitz> hayataadil: i have worked on that a little already but markelog__ may be able to help you more here the basic idea is to use a connect server or similar to server the needed testfiles instead of php
[08:50:06] <markelog__> hayataadil: i can answer you questions
[08:50:56] <markelog__> we have a ticket about it, with helpful discussion on it - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1999
[08:52:23] <markelog__> although migrating to node (io) is more or less a side-effect of changing our testing workflow 
[08:52:56] <hayataadil> ya i see
[08:54:18] <hayataadil> is there a subset of this project i can get started with ?
[08:56:41] <markelog__> it might be good idea to start here - https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students
