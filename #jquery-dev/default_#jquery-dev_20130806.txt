[10:50:08] <json-smith> anyone online - need help with equal div heights
[10:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> json-smith: Help is in #jquery
[15:28:36] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez re: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14227 yes
[15:28:52] <rwaldron> because we can't change 1.x, but 1.x is wrong
[15:30:12] <rwaldron> That ticket should actually be a duplicate
[20:14:33] <Guest11610> Hi
[20:24:14] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin|away: btw, the main reason several proposals include using saucelabs instead of browserstack is because of their Selenium API, as of last week BrowserStack released support for that API as well. It's very similar to what browserstack has.
[20:25:22] <Krinkle> I don't prefer either over the other, just saying that we no longer (to my knowledge) have much feature differences. It mostly comes down to other facts like existing infrastructure on our end. For example, we're in a close feedback loop with browserstack and they donated an account for us :)
[20:25:51] <Krinkle> but than again, saucelabs donated the whole opensource world an account
