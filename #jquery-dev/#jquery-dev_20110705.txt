[09:01:12] <JohnResig> timmywil_: hey
[09:02:31] <timmywil_> ajpiano and I haven't been available at the same times this morning
[09:03:22] <timmywil_> but it's looking like I won't be coming
[09:03:28] <timmywil_> JohnResig: ^
[09:04:34] <timmywil_> Having waited this long to get a ticket, they are naturally quite expensive and it's been up in the air so much, I haven't planned for the trip
[09:07:13] <timmywil_> JohnResig: However, I talked to Ralph and I know what to do for next time
[09:18:32] <JohnResig> timmywil_: ah, that's unfortunate
[09:18:39] <JohnResig> ok, thanks for the heads-up
[09:19:15] <timmywil_> JohnResig: yea, np
[09:19:26] <timmywil_> JohnResig: i'll be on skype tho
[10:37:01] <ajpiano> timmywil_ JohnResig sorry gents
[10:37:08] <ajpiano> i've been fighting the internet daemons in my router all morning
[10:37:16] <ajpiano> how much are flights?
[11:16:21] <timmywil_> back
[11:18:01] <timmywil_> ajpiano ^
[11:18:07] <ajpiano> seup
[11:18:11] <ajpiano> how much be flights
[11:18:36] <timmywil_> pretty bad, 650 was the best I found
[11:18:43] <ajpiano> roundtrip?
[11:18:47] <timmywil_> yea
[11:18:53] <ajpiano> $750 is budgeted
[11:19:16] <ajpiano> and you're the only one who is actually needing us to pay for travel
[11:19:20] <ajpiano> so i think we should do it
[11:19:33] <timmywil_> oh, well then
[11:19:42] <ajpiano> unless you also are like, not partic in the mood to do the whole flight in 2 days in a row etc etc etc
[11:20:10] <timmywil_> im ok with that.  I think next time I'd like to plan further ahead tho.
[11:21:28] <ajpiano> yes we certainly should
[11:22:23] <timmywil_> lemme see if it's still available
[11:25:33] <Sagar> hi
[11:26:03] <timmywil_> hmm, think I lost my window, now over 750.  It's ok tho, I'll come up next time which will help me prepare with stuff at work, etc.
[11:27:44] <timmywil_> ajpiano: I mean, it would be cool if they still had a flight cause I was looking forward to meeting everybody, but we'll do it next time.
[11:28:00] <ajpiano> ya
[11:28:07] <ajpiano> you should obvs come to jqcon
[11:28:15] <timmywil_> hehe obvs
[11:28:25] <timmywil_> actually signed up to speak
[11:29:00] <timmywil_> but I'll go whether or not that's accepted
[11:31:44] <ajpiano> woo
[12:25:33] <DaveMethvin> oh heck timmywil, i was just coming to meet you next week. you think i want to see ajpiano AGAIN???
[12:26:35] <ajpiano> haha
[12:30:06] <scott_gonzalez> docs#9748
[12:30:08] <bot-t> [#9748] Use msRequestAnimationFrame in jQuery.fx (new enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/9748
[12:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> there's an easy one for someone
[12:30:55] <timmywil_> DaveMethvin: catch you next time!
[12:31:11] <timmywil_> scott_gonzalez: dupe
[12:31:30] <scott_gonzalez> hmm... I searched for msRequestAnimationFrame and got 0 results
[12:31:46] <DaveMethvin> i know there's a pull for it
[12:32:06] <DaveMethvin> Microsoft implemented it? Mark that sucker CANTBELIEVE
[12:32:13] <timmywil_> scott_gonzalez: yea, that actual name wasn't in the ticket docs#9717
[12:32:15] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, [#9717] IE10PP2 supports requestionAnimationFrame (open enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/9717
[12:33:22] <timmywil_> should we include the non-prefixed?
[12:33:38] <scott_gonzalez> closed my own ticket :-P
[12:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> it's probably worth it even if nobody supports it yet
[12:34:39] <timmywil_> ok, that seems to be the consensus
[16:15:50] <rick-> danheberden yt?
[16:16:26] <rwaldron> anyone from infrastructure?
[18:06:08] <danheberden> rwaldron_ i'm here if you still need infra ?
