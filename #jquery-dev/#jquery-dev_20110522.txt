[12:00:44] <JohnResig> Hey everyone - I'm going to be moving tickets over from the spreadsheet to the bug tracker, please don't delete them until we have a chance to review them
[13:14:21] <gnarf> JohnResig: lol @ the trac spam on docs#9280
[13:14:22] <bot-t> JohnResig, [#9280] Allow multiple effect queues for animate() ( ) - http://jqbug.com/9280
[13:14:37] <gnarf> :-1, J/K, changed my vote.
[13:17:32] <matjas> can has developer access on the bug tracker?
[13:17:47] * matjas wants to vote
[13:18:03] <matjas> my account there is `mathias`, btw
[13:34:34] <JohnResig> gnarf: haha, I had to test somewhere!
[13:34:48] <gnarf> JohnResig: :) /me is honored ;)
[13:35:46] <JohnResig> matjas: done
[13:36:06] <gnarf> out of curiosity, does anyone think http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/uUvPe/1/ might be something useful to pluginify?
[13:36:25] <matjas> ty
[13:36:27] <gnarf> the idea was to provide something kinda like live() for "new content" being added to a page
[13:36:53] <gnarf> not sure that the weight of the feature is necessary in core, but it could be a decent plugin maybe?
[13:38:41] <JohnResig> I think I've seen similar done with events before
[13:38:49] <JohnResig> maybe this has better performance?
[13:39:44] <gnarf> JohnResig: i got tired of not having a solid recommendation for this situation, and this is similar to a pattern i use, but at little more easily used
[13:39:58] <gnarf> something to tell people not to use livequery ;)
[13:42:26] <JohnResig> ha
[17:24:32] <gnarf> rwaldron: yt?
[17:40:12] <gnarf> i think I'm spoiled by stackoverflow style posting

[17:42:50] <gnarf> heh
[17:43:08] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1058158 is an example of useful tho
[17:43:19] <gnarf> even http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1414365
[17:43:34] <gnarf> I've been going through and editing as many attr/prop questions as I can find on SO
[17:44:06] <gnarf> tbranyen: whats your userid on SO - I'll RSS stalk your posts to get you some rep :)
[17:44:10] <tbranyen> tbranyen

[17:44:51] <tbranyen> hmmm wonder if hardware accelerated canvas could do that
[17:45:31] <gnarf> paul_irish: i wish i could tell you who close voted that shit
[17:45:50] <paul_irish> close voted?
[17:46:21] <paul_irish> oh
[17:46:23] <paul_irish> i see.
[17:46:29] <paul_irish> weird
[17:47:18] <gnarf> paul_irish: i'd hang them
[18:05:00] <gnarf> hey - I'm getting pretty close to the end of ideas / code for jquery-color
[18:05:19] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/tree/api-2
[18:07:31] <gnarf> I'm pretty confident that we could maybe release it soon? whats the next step i need to take with it?
[18:54:36] <timmywil> wo, 100 jquery emails
[19:16:44] <rwaldron> timmywil, i realized after my first round of deleting them that if i kept them, they would just "thread" themselves instead of becoming _more_ unique emails to delete
[19:17:00] <rwaldron> so, hold on to the first 81 and let em thread
[19:17:15] <rwaldron> or else you'll be deleting them 81x8 times
[19:17:26] <timmywil> rwaldron: good point
[19:18:03] <ajpiano> i have a separate folder for jquery trac e-mails so i just don't care
[19:18:43] <rwaldron> timmywil, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/384 means well, but if we land it, we then set a precedent that jQuery patches itself when others fuck with native and host object
[19:18:48] <rwaldron> so, that being said.
[19:18:50] <rwaldron> fuck that.
[19:19:06] <rwaldron> ajpiano, folder? what the fuck is a folder?
[19:19:13] <rwaldron> :)
[19:19:17] <ajpiano> filter, folder, whatever
[19:19:54] <miketaylr> also, isn't hasOwnProperty slow?
[19:20:04] <rwaldron> yes
[19:20:04] <timmywil> miketaylr: no it's faster
[19:20:17] <timmywil> but I don't like that pull anyway
[19:20:18] <miketaylr> hmm, phiggins was telling me it's dog slow
[19:20:18] <rwaldron> timmywil, prove it. I dare you.
[19:20:33] <rwaldron> miketaylr, lets just put it this way...
[19:20:42] <timmywil> I did a perf test.  forget what I called it
[19:20:50] <timmywil> why would it be slow?
[19:20:54] <rwaldron> hasOwnProperty won't be making the team next time Special Olympics is in town
[19:20:54] <timmywil> it checks less
[19:21:07] <miketaylr> aww picked last on the special olympics team
[19:21:25] <rwaldron> timmywil, we must be talking about something unrelated.
[19:21:34] <timmywil> hasOwn vs in?
[19:21:47] <rwaldron> well, thats a start
[19:22:15] <rwaldron> I had this argument re: Popcorn.js plugin factory
[19:22:17] <rwaldron> and I won
[19:22:20] <rwaldron> so...
[19:22:25] <rwaldron> let me have it?
[19:23:09] <timmywil> I don't see the need for it in css, but I wouldn't say hasOwn is slow.  If you have to choose between hasOwn and in, hasOwn will be faster.
[19:23:26] <timmywil> but longer
[19:23:29] <timmywil> so it's a tradeoff
[19:23:41] <miketaylr> hmm, i'll have to pull logs on pete's explanation to me
[19:23:43] <miketaylr> i don't remember
[19:25:13] <miketaylr> go grep go
[19:25:57] <bot-t> go go gadget grep
[19:27:27] <rwaldron> timmywil, oh-rite. its hasOwn vs. existence.. not "in"
[19:28:16] <timmywil> ah, that makes sense
[19:28:46] <timmywil> just that may not be viable in IE6/7 with functions
[19:28:48] <rwaldron> sorry i was being over-general
[19:28:53] <rwaldron> and 1/2 wrong
[19:29:32] <rwaldron> right. my argument comes from the land where IE6/7 dont exist
[19:29:51] <rwaldron> so, given the two, hasOwn wins
[19:29:54] <rwaldron> fair enough
[19:29:58] <rwaldron> but this patch sucks
[19:30:25] <rwaldron> because I dont think jQuery should be apologetic for stupid host/native object meddling
[19:30:55] <timmywil> agreed.  I'd be concerned of where that would lead our code.
[19:31:17] <rwaldron> there is actually not a single possible instance that I can think of in which one _must_ alter host/native objects
[19:31:28] <rwaldron> exactly
[19:31:44] <rwaldron> if we bend once, then we'll find ourselves bent all the time
[19:31:51] <rwaldron> ass full of...
[19:31:53] <rwaldron> ;)
