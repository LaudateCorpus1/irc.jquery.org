[11:53:37] <toshiba> hi friends
[11:53:38] <toshiba>  can somebody tell me that if there is any jquery plugin for classromm teaching?
[11:58:48] <m_gol> toshiba: support is in #jquery
[11:59:35] <toshiba> m_gol, is it?
[11:59:49] <toshiba> is there any specific release for that?
[12:00:09] <m_gol> I mean such questions belong in the #jquery channel, not here
[12:04:43] <toshiba> oki bro
[12:04:43] <toshiba> and what is supported here?
[13:32:34] <kripper> Hi
[13:32:40] <kripper> happy sunday hacking
[13:32:46] <kripper> I have a strange issue here
[13:32:51] <kripper> releasePageTransitionLock() is changing the page
[13:33:02] <kripper> (calls changePage)
[13:33:10] <kripper> when I hit the back button
[13:33:24] <kripper> I have no idea why
[13:34:02] <kripper> anyone is familiar with the transition lock system?
[13:40:22] <kripper> it seems it has to do with the focus?
[13:50:54] <kripper> or some transition enqueued in pageTransitionQueue?
