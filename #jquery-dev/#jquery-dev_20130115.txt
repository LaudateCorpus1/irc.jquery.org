[05:11:02] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano scott_gonzalez and anyone else who's awake ... last call before this is posted: http://blog.jquery.com/?p=2419&preview=true&preview_id=2419&public=1&nonce=233dbf23cd
[05:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> Huh, I could've sworn I fixed the indentation in the code block of the upgrade guide.
[05:12:23] <DaveMethvin> don't sweat it
[05:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> I won't :-)
[05:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> You might want to add #readme to the link for the migrate readme.
[05:13:34] <DaveMethvin> oh good point
[05:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> downpayment -> down payment
[05:16:24] <scott_gonzalez> looks good
[05:16:36] <DaveMethvin> okay, i'll publish it then
[05:16:47] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez can you update the version at jquery.com?
[05:17:03] <DaveMethvin> i don't trust my internet connection
[05:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ummm...yeah, let me just undo everything danheberden has done :-P
[05:18:02] <DaveMethvin> haha
[05:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need any files added, right?
[05:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> Just change 1.8.3 -> 1.9.0 in a few places?
[05:18:32] <DaveMethvin> nope, just the version change

[05:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> I think I'm going to force push master :-/
[05:20:04] <DaveMethvin> do what you gotta do
[05:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? Why do we have two legacy branches?
[05:21:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, one is local only. Must be super old.
[05:23:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, this is such a mess.
[05:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> I really don't want to force push jquery-wp-content.
[05:25:01] <scott_gonzalez> I think I'm going to revert all of the commits individually :-(
[05:27:01] <scott_gonzalez> FUUUU
[05:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> There's a merge commit in here.
[05:27:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm now in revert hell.
[05:30:08] <DaveMethvin> ok, gotta board here ... good luck, i may be able to get internet on the plane

[09:04:10] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin|away: still need a tweet?????
[09:04:35] <ajpiano> yes, obviously :p
[09:04:39] <ajpiano> i peeked
[09:38:25] <paul_irish> Krinkle|detached: do you know much about Wikipedia's high DPI plans?
[09:39:03] <paul_irish> Krinkle|detached: Chrome would like to help if we can understand whats up :)
[09:52:01] <Krinkle> paul_irish: I do know about it, yes.
[09:52:03] <Krinkle> paul_irish: Let me look it up
[09:52:16] <paul_irish> Krinkle: awes
[09:52:23] <Krinkle> paul_irish: What we're doing is swapping src attributes on doc-ready based on the ratio.
[09:52:26] <Krinkle> We wrote a jQuery plugin for the MediaWiki software to use
[09:52:39] <Krinkle> Let me pull up the associated details, just a second.
[09:53:05] <paul_irish> Krinkle: i heard logos, buttons, favicon are still lowres. haven't confirmed
[09:53:43] <Krinkle> paul_irish: Indeed, the "hdpi" module is related towards content, thumbnails inside articles.
[09:54:48] <Krinkle> paul_irish: This is where it started: https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/24115/
[09:54:56] <Krinkle> jquery plugin, and attributes in the html formatter.
[09:55:06] <Krinkle> and polifil for devicePixelRatio
[09:55:55] <Krinkle> paul_irish: Buttons are CSS, so no dpi issue there
[09:56:07] <Krinkle> paul_irish: favicons, what do you suggest for that?
[09:58:49] <Krinkle> paul_irish: Is there a syntax for favicon links in html regarding pixel ratio?
[09:59:05] <Krinkle> I suppose there isn't and we should use .ico instead of .png?
[09:59:23] <Krinkle> right now favicons are mostly auto-generated from svg files into png.
[10:01:29] <paul_irish> k lemme poke around
[10:01:46] <paul_irish> Krinkle: is there a good mailing list or IRC channel to come into?
[10:01:50] <paul_irish> my colleague has better details
[10:02:02] <Krinkle> #wikimedia-dev
[10:02:25] <Krinkle> (on freenode)
[10:02:26] <Krinkle> and https://lists.wikimedia.org/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l

[19:56:06] <snover> so angry dave
[19:56:10] <snover> i think you need to‚Ä¶relax
[19:56:56] <DaveMethvin> it's all better now
[19:57:07] <DaveMethvin> the deploy looked bad but now it's good
[20:02:33] <arschmitz> Anyone around in here tonight?
[20:02:45] <DaveMethvin> it depends :)
[20:02:52] <danheberden> WHO'S ASKIN
[20:03:22] <arschmitz> Hey danheberden haven't talked to you since Korea 
[20:03:38] <danheberden> arschmitz: shit's been cray! how you been?
[20:03:53] <arschmitz> Really good you?
[20:04:40] <danheberden> doing alright  :)
[20:04:58] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: So question about a change in 1.9 did you change or remove $.event.handle?
[20:05:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's been $.event.dispatch for a while
[20:05:40] <arschmitz> Ah ok we are still using handle in some events on jqm
[20:06:19] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: Guess its time we update that
[20:06:27] <DaveMethvin> i think that changed back in 1.7, and handle wasn't ever documented
[20:06:40] <DaveMethvin> lemme find the source mengion
[20:07:09] <arschmitz> I knew it was not documented so I figured it probably went away
[20:07:31] <DaveMethvin> the upgrade guide mentions it's gone, i figured someone was using it :)
[20:07:37] <gibson042> yeah arschmitz, I removed it basically right before 1.9 went live
[20:07:50] <gibson042> I was worried we wouldn't break enough downstream projects otherwise
[20:07:56] <DaveMethvin> lol
[20:08:00] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/72300.png
[20:08:00] <DaveMethvin> our work here is done
[20:08:13] <danheberden> I'll miss $.uuid
[20:08:15] <arschmitz> gibson042:  Explains why we didn't notice on git build before
[20:08:31] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: make your own damn numbers! 
[20:08:54] <danheberden> gasp
[20:09:06] <DaveMethvin> it's always tough to decide how to document that you're removing an undocumented thing
[20:09:27] <DaveMethvin> WE'RE TAKING OUT THIS THING WE NEVER SAID EXISTED! 
[20:09:40] <arschmitz> Ha ha yeah
[20:10:13] <DaveMethvin> in that case its pretty straightforward, just change the name
[20:10:25] <arschmitz> Yea simple 
[20:10:39] <arschmitz> It's only like 3 places in one file took
[20:11:23] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.8-stable/src/event.js#L591
[20:11:52] <DaveMethvin> note that dispatch isn't documented either :D

[20:12:54] <gibson042> oh yeah, that was my "use documented APIs" solution :D
[20:13:04] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: What you expect us to look at your comments about undocumented stuff when we use it pff lol
[20:13:18] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: thanks for the quick turnaround on that!
[20:13:31] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: no problem
[20:13:40] <mikesherov> of course it's the day of final, right?
[20:13:52] <mikesherov> it's fixed for 1.9
[20:13:54] <DaveMethvin> well it was a week ago and i somehow missed it
[20:14:01] <mikesherov> I'm checking why or why not 2.0 is busted
[20:14:05] <mikesherov> I missed it too
[20:14:07] <mikesherov> so there
[20:14:15] <gibson042> mikesherov everyone knows not to use a jQuery x.y.0
[20:14:17] <DaveMethvin> ok, so WE suck, group hug
[20:14:27] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 makes a good point
[20:14:36] <DaveMethvin> i can hardly wait for 1.9.2
[20:14:40] <gibson042> lol
[20:14:44] <DaveMethvin> THAT will be the good one
[20:15:04] <DaveMethvin> i just love all these people using jquery-latest.js
[20:15:17] <gibson042> .live, Y U NO WORK?
[20:15:17] <b-ot> (Â±Æ'–î')Â±Æ
[20:15:20] <DaveMethvin> amazing that we haven't hosed those sites in previous releases
[20:15:29] <DaveMethvin> WE MUST TRY HARDER
[20:16:14] <arschmitz> Yeah 1.9 barely broke anything for mobile 3 lines in whole thing im dissappointed in all of you!
[20:16:29] <DaveMethvin> we will strive to break more in the future
[20:16:42] <arschmitz> That's what I like to heart
[20:16:47] <arschmitz> Heart
[20:17:06] <arschmitz> Ah I hate iOS sometimes
[20:17:13] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: bug exists, and is fixed by cherry-pick for 2.0 as well
[20:17:46] <mikesherov> land it?
[20:17:50] <DaveMethvin> kill two bugs with one pull, do it!
[20:18:07] <mikesherov> OK, so I've never updated 1.9 before
[20:18:21] <DaveMethvin> i can do it if you want
[20:18:27] <mikesherov> great, thanks
[20:18:37] <DaveMethvin> altho i'm pretty spaced out right now so imm a wait til morning
[20:19:00] <DaveMethvin> i was in SFO at 6am and now i'm in baltimore

[20:47:52] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: 
[20:47:53] <paul_irish> I'm hearding the Blogger guys are requesting that the /1/ alias be changed to 1.8.3 instead of 1.9.0
[20:48:26] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: why are they using the uncached CDN version?
[20:48:42] <DaveMethvin> that's as dumb as people who use jquery-latest.js
[20:49:10] <paul_irish> "it's apparently causing big breakages for blogger users"
[20:49:16] <DaveMethvin> well no shit
[20:49:35] <paul_irish> ya
[20:49:42] <DaveMethvin> you mean blogger has been force-upgrading people immediately all these years?
[20:49:56] <paul_irish> one sec. my buddy Eddie who did the CDN push this morning is coming in here
[20:50:05] <paul_irish> (i dont know)
[20:50:24] <DaveMethvin> here lemme look at my blog.methvin.com
[20:50:31] <ekay> hey all
[20:50:34] <paul_irish> ekay: thx. for some reason your IMs were going to my phone. so i could type back quickly
[20:50:41] <ekay> np
[20:50:56] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: this is Eddie. he did the push this morning. and is an awesome dude.
[20:51:06] <paul_irish> ekay: Dave's the dev and project lead for jquery
[20:51:09] <ekay> mletis says Blogger templates were using the alias
[20:51:21] <paul_irish> ah. default ones?
[20:51:23] <ekay> Dave: nice to meet you!
[20:51:28] <DaveMethvin> hi ekay!
[20:51:47] <paul_irish> all three of us are in agreement that it's totally stupid to be using that /1/ alias
[20:51:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's bad for caching
[20:52:05] <paul_irish> yup. i wrote the first post on that behavior. :)
[20:52:07] <DaveMethvin> plus it's bad b/c the user gets an immediate upgrade
[20:52:18] <sizcommit> 01[13sizzle01] 15gibson042 pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/uvXOvQ
[20:52:18] <sizcommit> 13sizzle/06master 14c04fce3 15Richard Gibson: No ticket: small size optimizations....
[20:52:40] <DaveMethvin> but if they want 1.8.3 they should ask for it
[20:52:43] <ekay> yup, they now know
[20:52:56] <paul_irish> ekay: i have the feeling these guys are just gonna have to break
[20:52:57] <ekay> they've hardcoded 1.8.3 now but the rollout will take "a while"
[20:53:18] <paul_irish> the blogger eng's are helping out the poorly written templates?
[20:53:31] <DaveMethvin> well dropping back /1/ seems like it has some risks too
[20:53:36] <ekay> the default templates are affected
[20:53:39] <DaveMethvin> bc it's supposed to be hte latest
[20:54:24] <DaveMethvin> so once a person chooses a template can blogger update it for things like jquery version?
[20:54:38] <paul_irish> http://googletesting.blogspot.com/ is using it, as an example.
[20:54:56] <ekay> a blogger eng is explaining the situation in an IM, I'll transcribe here
[20:55:05] <ekay> "the default templates have just been changed to 1.8.3 and that will go live next week"
[20:55:14] <paul_irish> ah. $.browser
[20:55:15] <ekay> "the templates for blogs that users have already created, and ones created until the fix goes live, are using /1/, so we are changing the JS that is included to be 1.9 compatible"
[20:55:45] <DaveMethvin> well  you gotta do what you gotta do
[20:56:49] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: is that the most recent template?
[20:56:56] <DaveMethvin> it's got several mistakes
[20:57:04] <DaveMethvin> they're shivving ie9/10
[20:57:05] <paul_irish> no idea. i was just looking randomly for something broken
[20:57:08] <paul_irish> :)
[20:57:16] <paul_irish> didnt do their testing! lol
[20:57:21] <ekay> hehe
[20:57:30] <DaveMethvin> also the x-ua-compatible is too low down to take effect i am pretty sure
[20:57:53] <DaveMethvin> let me know if you want a review on whatever is the latest
[20:59:21] <paul_irish> ekay: well,
[20:59:30] <DaveMethvin> well if blogger can't deploy for a week then you'll need some solution for the interim, and backing up /1/ may be the only choice but you should probably post an explanation why
[20:59:38] <DaveMethvin> so other people will know
[20:59:43] <paul_irish> yeah
[20:59:49] <DaveMethvin> and i think we all agree nobody should be using /1/ anyway
[20:59:54] <paul_irish> i know i was pinging /1/ a few times earlier to see when it went up
[20:59:55] <DaveMethvin> so this is their punishment :D
[20:59:59] <paul_irish> hah
[21:00:15] <mikesherov> death to /1/!
[21:00:19] <ekay> yeah, /1/'s definitely deprecated.
[21:00:31] <DaveMethvin> 24 hour caching should be enough for anyone!
[21:00:37] <mikesherov> OK, I'm delirious now. 
[21:00:41] <DaveMethvin> -- bill gates
[21:00:47] <mikesherov> night
[21:01:01] <DaveMethvin> so ekay paul_irish if you gotta, you gotta
[21:01:28] <paul_irish> ekay: 1) i'm pretty lukewarm on shifting CDN policy to deal with this fallout
[21:01:43] <paul_irish> 2) the scheduled push is scheduled for like noon pacific tomorrow. and i can't force it earlier.
[21:01:48] <paul_irish> only bryan can
[21:02:00] * paul_irish might be wrong about that...
[21:02:06] <ekay> ok.
[21:02:25] <ekay> I'll relay that to mletis and let him decide whether we should wake Bryan.
[21:02:39] <DaveMethvin> DON'T WAKE BRYAN!
[21:03:05] <paul_irish> :)
[21:03:13] <DaveMethvin> and honest if you need a review on these templates let me know
[21:03:23] <DaveMethvin> they look a little off to me

[21:45:19] <ekay> DaveMethvin|away: The Blogger team pushed an emergency JS fix to make it compatible with 1.9.0 which seems to have been successful. paul and I are leaving the redirect as is, so /1/ still points at 1.9.0.
[21:45:44] <paul_irish> i doubt this'll be the last time we hear this particular cry
[21:45:59] <paul_irish> but. hooray at a successful conclusion!
