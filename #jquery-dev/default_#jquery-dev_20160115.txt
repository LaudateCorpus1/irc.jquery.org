[16:53:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: look how easy! https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2840
[16:54:54] <DaveMethvin> just like when you fix the toilet by jiggling the handle timmywil  :)
[16:55:02] <DaveMethvin> that wasn't bad
[16:55:11] <timmywil> ha
[16:55:30] <DaveMethvin> tracker is looking pretty clean now
[16:55:55] <timmywil> Do you know why this calls parentNode twice? https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/blob/selected/src/attributes/prop.js#L88
[16:56:38] <timmywil> and yea!
[16:56:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah there was some strange thing with selects that had a parent
[16:56:52] <DaveMethvin> lemme see if i can find the ticke
[16:57:02] <DaveMethvin> there should have been a support comment with that one too
[16:57:18] <timmywil> yea, but it's been there as long as I can remember
[16:57:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's an old one
[16:58:47] <timmywil> oh, optgroups
[16:59:39] <DaveMethvin> i thought you had fixed that one in the 1.6 era for some reason
[17:00:16] <timmywil> John did it for Safari https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/4729f4d44326fd302c63af8f3324b6c4bac54084
[17:00:26] <timmywil> I wonder if we can drop that
[17:00:35] <DaveMethvin> oh before hooks
[17:00:45] <timmywil> yea
[17:00:52] <DaveMethvin> only one way to know... :)
[17:01:07] <DaveMethvin> i suspect safari fixed that a long time ago but who knows
[17:02:25] <timmywil> Safari looks okay. Checking ie9
[17:03:18] <timmywil> ie9 looks okay too. 
[17:05:45] <DaveMethvin> currently trying to fix https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom/issues/717 on the jsdom side
[17:06:07] <DaveMethvin> code is relatively straightforward, tests are a nightmare to figure out
[17:06:16] <DaveMethvin> glad it's not just jquery :)

[17:11:58] <timmywil> ah, ie9 was not okay
[17:12:20] <DaveMethvin> so get and set are both for the benefit of IE i guess
[17:12:41] <DaveMethvin> that means your support comment is in the right place
[17:14:48] <timmywil> yea, added support for optgroups in the setter too
