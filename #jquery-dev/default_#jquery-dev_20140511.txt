[05:00:41] <mayerbci> does anybody know why clicking the back button on Safari browser the previous page draws fine but Safari keeps running for up to a minute? 
[05:01:34] <mayerbci> all my pages complete in half a nminute when clicking regular buttons but the back button almost always causes pages to run up to  aminute but the page already completed
[05:02:18] <mayerbci> also...when using the back button radio buttons do not retain their values
[05:16:18] <scott_gonzalez> mayerbci: This is not the correct channel for such a question.
[05:16:27] <scott_gonzalez> This is only for development of jQuery.
[05:16:30] <mayerbci> which is?
[05:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> #jquery, Stack Overflow, etc.
[05:16:55] <mayerbci> using jquery and jquerymobile; this is where the issue is
[05:17:15] <mayerbci> i see thanks
