[07:15:37] <rworth> rwaldron what's the status of your grunt branch? I just checked it out and ran npm install and then grunt but I get an error
[07:18:05] <rworth> hmm, seems I just had to init submodules manually
[07:20:48] <rwaldron> rworth it's in 1.8pre
[07:20:49] <bot-t> (1 hour 6 mins 40 secs ago) <mikesherov> tell rwaldron got grunt working, here are the steps that worked for me: https://gist.github.com/2489540
[07:21:00] <rworth> rwaldron thanks
[07:21:03] <rwaldron> rworth can you give me the error?
[07:21:20] <rworth> rwaldron let me try 1.8pre
[07:21:38] <rwaldron> I think I need to add some kind of "auto-npm install"
[07:21:43] <rwaldron> because everyone seems to miss that
[07:23:45] <rworth> so, are we free of the Makefile? It still exists and is referenced by the README. Not sure what's still WIP or in testing
[07:25:08] <rworth> to give you some context I saw https://gist.github.com/2489540 and wondered about how well grunt is running in Windows because I just set it up in api.jquery.com
[07:25:29] <rworth> was getting ready to test it and haven't seen a need (yet) for Cygwin
[07:26:06] <rworth> s/api.jquery.com/the api.jquery.com repo/
[07:28:58] <rworth> rwaldron ok, same result in 1.8pre. If you haven't manually init'ed submodules, running grunt errors https://gist.github.com/2490081
[07:35:32] <rwaldron> rworth yeah, I haven't done anything with submodules yet
[07:35:42] <rwaldron> but this is super helpful
[07:35:44] <rwaldron> thank you
[07:35:45] <rworth> rwaldron ok, now I got to the compare-size task and it does indeed fail
[07:36:09] <rworth> can't find dist/.sizecache.json
[07:36:10] <rwaldron> can you add the errors to that gist
[07:36:15] <rworth> yeah
[07:36:18] <rwaldron> thanks
[07:38:24] <rworth> rwaldron done
[07:58:09] <rwaldron> rworth I just pushed a test + patch that should fix the issue
[07:58:15] <rwaldron> updated npm

[08:04:46] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Put default settings in testswarm-defaults.ini instead of in init.php - Timo Tijhof
[08:08:48] <rworth> rwaldron there's now a silent failure if there is no git command found
[08:10:17] <rworth> Is there some good way of checking non-npm dependencies like that? I've got the same issue with the docs. I want to ensure xmllint is installed.
[08:10:22] <rworth> I guess I can just add a dependencies task?
[08:10:43] <rwaldron> hm.
[08:10:53] <rwaldron> no git command?
[08:11:04] <rwaldron> how did you get jquery source code to begin with?
[08:11:28] <rwaldron> what is "xmllint"?
[08:11:43] <rwaldron> rworth ^
[08:11:50] <rworth> rwaldron ok, now with git installed and in the path, still a silent failure
[08:12:04] <rwaldron> what system are you on?
[08:12:16] <rwaldron> i need as much detail as possiblwe
[08:12:35] <rworth> sorry, xmllint was related to my grunt task in the api.jquery.com repo
[08:12:39] <rwaldron> because on my end, it works perfectly from start to finish
[08:12:43] <rwaldron> ok
[08:13:00] <rworth> I'm on Windows 7 with only node and msysgit installed
[08:13:04] <rworth> no cygwin
[08:13:48] <rworth> I got the jquery source in OS x, into a shared folder that I then test in my Windows vm
[08:14:13] <rwaldron> hm
[08:14:34] <rwaldron> wouldnt you only need to test built jquery?
[08:15:26] <rwaldron> We're making a push to move away from each source module being wrapped in IIFEs and included with sep. script tags to the test suite
[08:15:36] <rwaldron> because that's not an accurate portrayal of jQuery

[08:16:56] <rwaldron> effffff

[08:18:14] <rworth> ok, then I'm not sure what you're talking about. I'm testing building jQuery using grunt on Windows, more specifically testing how well grunt runs on Windows with minimal non-npm-non-grunt software installed

[08:19:19] <rworth> rwaldron what does that have to do with each source module being wrapped in IIFEs ?
[08:19:25] <rworth> rwaldron yup
[08:19:38] <rwaldron> rworth nothing, I was confused
[08:19:42] <rworth> ok
[08:19:55] <rwaldron> let's start from your " hence my clean windows with only node and grunt and msysgit"
[08:20:07] <rworth> ok
[08:20:08] <rwaldron> checklist: node, npm, grunt
[08:20:11] <rwaldron> and git
[08:20:32] <rworth> since npm is part of node these days, I assumed it in that list, yes
[08:20:41] <rwaldron> have you run "npm install" from within the jquery repo dir?
[08:20:45] <rworth> yes
[08:20:50] <rwaldron> ok
[08:20:52] <rworth> I have to do that before I can run grunt
[08:20:58] <rwaldron> so there is a node_modules
[08:21:02] <rworth> yes
[08:21:15] <rworth> has grunt and grunt-compare-size folders
[08:21:19] <rwaldron> inside there is: .bin, grunt, grunt-compare-size
[08:21:30] <rwaldron> maybe .bin is system specific
[08:21:35] <rwaldron> no worries
[08:21:37] <rwaldron> ok
[08:21:58] <rwaldron> can you run "npm install grunt-compare-size" for me?
[08:22:04] <rwaldron> just to make sure you have the latest
[08:22:17] <rwaldron> v0.1.5
[08:23:03] <rworth> got it
[08:23:44] <rwaldron> great
[08:23:54] <rworth> ok, I found the error
[08:24:11] <rwaldron> now run grunt -v
[08:25:05] <rworth> in the git_current_branch helper when it does the spawn for "git" cmd, error "CreateProcessW: The system cannot find the file specified."
[08:25:32] <rworth> but git from the command line works fine
[08:31:05] <rworth> weird, I can run >git branch --no-color
[08:31:12] <rworth> and I get the expected output
[09:01:38] <gnarf> .
[09:01:38] <bot-t> (2 hours 47 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell gnarf got grunt working, here are the steps that worked for me: https://gist.github.com/2489540
[09:02:06] <rworth> rwaldron about to send a pull request to add some error handling
[09:04:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: whats so sweet about it?
[09:05:07] <scott_gonzalez> Fields that you can't edit (because of perms) show up, but are crossed out and disabled.
[09:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> You can't submit without previewing first.
[09:05:32] <scott_gonzalez> If you don't have an email address set in your preferences, it warns you on the preview page.
[09:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> The required preview and warning if no email address are really nice.
[09:08:58] <rworth> +1
[09:11:43] <Krinkle> I *love* npm. It works pretty awesome. And very clean as well (aptget has the habbit of spilling the terminal with a lot of debugging stuff by default)
[09:12:05] <Krinkle> Just installed testswarm-browserstack locally. requires 3 simple npm install commands and that's it
[09:23:11] <rwaldron> rworth cool, i'll take a look when it arrive
[09:23:45] <rworth> still a mystery why it can't find the command, I'll keep digging on that

[09:35:32] <ben_alman> sure
[09:36:27] <mikesherov> XP is definitely a problem with child_process
[09:36:55] <mikesherov> it's part of why pulley uses setTimeout.. to work around timing issues in Windows XP
[09:37:04] <ben_alman> stop using xp
[09:37:06] <ben_alman> :)
[09:37:09] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:37:18] <mikesherov> I like having a variety of environments
[09:37:25] <ben_alman> yeah
[09:37:31] <mikesherov> When XP is EOL, I'll move on
[09:37:33] <ben_alman> just don't expect grunt or node to work in xp
[09:37:35] <ben_alman> heh
[09:37:44] <mikesherov> sure, and yet, here it is, working :-)
[09:38:08] <mikesherov> and I think those same instructions will make it work in cygwin in Windows 7
[09:38:13] <mikesherov> just trying to get some confirm
[09:38:13] <ben_alman> well, at least the subset you're relying on works
[09:38:20] <mikesherov> right, YMMV, for sure
[09:38:29] <ben_alman> yeah i want to add it to the FAQ but only once it's fleshed out
[09:38:39] <mikesherov> yup
[09:38:44] <mikesherov> I'll continue working on it
[09:38:51] <mikesherov> I'll test a windows 7 installation now
[09:39:23] <ben_alman> great
[09:41:08] <ben_alman> ok, afk

[12:55:04] <rworth> gnarf any idea why a command that's in my windows path isn't being found by node's child_process spawn?
[12:57:27] <gnarf> no clue
[12:57:38] <gnarf> i haven't touched windows other than to play video games in years
[12:57:55] <gnarf> maybe if mikesherov drops by today he might be able to help
[12:58:01] <rworth> thanks
