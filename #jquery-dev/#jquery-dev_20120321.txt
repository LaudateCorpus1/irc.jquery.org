[10:36:34] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[12:14:03] <louisremi> Hola, looks like we broke the ability to animate margins to negative values (currently in trunk). So I fixed it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/710
[12:14:05] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by louisremi (3m, 13s ago): fix 11469: exclude margins from the properties that can't be negative.
[12:22:33] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Thanks for your reviews
[12:22:33] <bot-t> (1 hour 45 mins ago) <jzaefferer> tell krinkle http://swarm.jquery.org/phpinfo.php
[12:23:17] <Krinkle> Okay, in that case my initial requirement for PHP 5.2.3 will be fine
[12:23:43] <Krinkle> although I could say that one should upgrade to PHP 5.3 (or 5.4 soon), this is good enough for now.
[12:24:16] <Krinkle> apache2handler looking good, lots of modules :)
[12:24:21] <Krinkle> nice server
[12:26:07] <DaveMethvin> louisremi: thanks for that fix, I dunno how I missed that

[12:48:02] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin louisremi cool fix, but can we get a test for thaT?
[12:48:11] <rwaldron> s/T/s
[12:48:13] <rwaldron> ack
[12:48:24] <rwaldron> please, forgive my typos
[12:48:28] <rwaldron> request still stands
[12:50:13] <louisremi> rwaldron: Yep, that would be good, I'll try to do it tomorrow.
[12:50:27] <rwaldron> louisremi thanks!
[12:50:28] <rwaldron> :)
[12:51:26] <louisremi> wow, I didn't knew 1.7.2 was that close! My patch was just in time.
[13:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Does Google verify the checksums in the manfist file that we send?
[13:49:52] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez "manfist"
[13:49:56] <rwaldron> ;)
[13:50:14] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:50:23] <DaveMethvin> haha
[13:50:29] <DaveMethvin> sounds painful
[13:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> My fingers apparently don't like the word manifest.
[13:50:41] <scott_gonzalez> But they sure do like forming a manfist!
[13:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> First we send them a manifest, then when they tell us it's wrong, we send them the manfist.

[15:57:35] <jaubourg> hi there
[16:18:09] <Krinkle> Hm.. is there some kind of tagging system at Github? Like tagging a revision with "needs-unit-test"?
[16:18:18] <Krinkle> something I could paste onto https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/07c8a9b2448f42ee940e7fc1351344eb372f7463#commitcomment-1116483
[16:18:18] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by dmethvin (3h, 50m ago): Fix #11469. Exclude margins from the negative property check.
[16:18:31] <Krinkle> (which would be trackable somewhere)
[17:29:12] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Any chance they use some simple tool that we can run locally to verify our builds?
[17:33:58] <paul_irish> hm
[17:34:06] <paul_irish> its just yaknow
[17:34:17] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[17:34:19] <paul_irish> running `shasum`
[17:34:26] <paul_irish> and md5sum
[17:35:39] <scott_gonzalez> oh, interesting. I didn't realize there was a CLI for checking shas.
[17:36:46] <scott_gonzalez> That's good to know, so we can verify that our build is doing the correct thing.
[17:37:00] <paul_irish> coolcool :D
[17:37:02] <scott_gonzalez> Though we're using md5s and I don't seem to have md5sum :-P
[17:37:09] <paul_irish> yah i think i brew'd it or some shit
[17:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure a quick Google search will fix this.
[17:37:26] <paul_irish> or md5
[17:38:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, cool. I do have md5.
[17:38:07] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[17:44:46] <Krinkle> Hey paul_irish
[17:45:51] <Krinkle> I was looking at your blog the other day and wondering what all those <span>'s are
[17:46:02] <Krinkle> <h2 class="c6"><span>Logical</span> <span>Actions</span></h2>
[17:48:17] <paul_irish> Krinkle: heh
[17:48:24] <paul_irish> output from googledocs that i was too lazy to clean up
[17:48:30] <Krinkle> Ah
[17:48:36] <paul_irish> i actually wrote a small app to clean up the HTML.. today!
[17:48:39] <paul_irish> but for something else
[17:49:07] <Krinkle> right, because googledocs has it's own js-renderer for everything
[17:49:43] <Krinkle> i.e. the kind where "even the blinking cursor is an element"
[17:49:46] <paul_irish> yup
[17:49:56] <paul_irish> aka contenteditable makes you cry
[17:50:27] <Krinkle> Yeah, I know all about it. contenteditable is nice if you don't have much time. It's a lot of features in little time,
[17:50:35] <Krinkle> but as soon as you hit it's limit, it's over.
[17:51:03] <Krinkle> We had the same problem at the Wikimedia Foundation (the new Visual Editor project for MediaWiki)
[17:51:53] <Krinkle> we went with the same conclusion. It takes a lot to do it right, but it's worth creating an entire renderer from scratch. Then things like handling special MediaWiki-type objects can get first-class handling
[17:52:05] <Krinkle> still very early stages, but if you're interested let me know :)
[17:52:20] <Krinkle> https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:VisualEditorSandbox
[17:52:35] <Krinkle> (not the latest version, but you get the idea)
[17:56:07] <Krinkle> paul_irish: btw, what did I hear about ShopTalkShow and yayQuery merging? can you share anything?
[17:56:25] <paul_irish> ha
[17:56:27] <paul_irish> that's a great idea
[17:56:34] <paul_irish> whered you hear that
[17:56:39] <Krinkle> I made it up
[17:56:40] <Krinkle> :P
[17:56:49] <paul_irish> o
[17:56:54] <paul_irish> good thinkin
[17:56:55] <Krinkle> I listen to both, would love to see it merge since both seem to need extra juice
[17:56:59] <paul_irish> well
[17:57:11] <paul_irish> consider STS the 2.0 of yQ
[17:57:21] <paul_irish> yQ will do one last ep
[17:58:34] <Krinkle> STS is currently on a slightly different focus (partially overlapping with that yayQuery covered) but I think STS could expand it's focus a little bit to include the more javascript stuff.
[17:58:56] <Krinkle> and of course the yayQuery people! Not just the subjects they covered :)
[17:59:00] <Krinkle> STS needs more unicorns
[18:00:21] <Krinkle> ohwell, we'll see how it goes.
[18:00:43] <Krinkle> Glad to hear there is going to be at least 1 more yQ ep tho :)
