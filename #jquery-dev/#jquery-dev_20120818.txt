[10:10:49] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: Hi
[10:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> So is padding-box new and just not implemented in most browsers?
[10:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> I see this note though:
[10:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> Note: The ‘padding-box’ value is at risk.
[10:12:21] <mikesherov_> yeah, it's at risk
[10:12:28] <mikesherov_> it was only ever implemented in FF
[10:12:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for responding to that PR.
[10:14:51] <mikesherov> no problem
