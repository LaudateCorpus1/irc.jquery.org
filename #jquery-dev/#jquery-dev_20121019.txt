[01:13:54] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Merge pull request #998 from jquery/strict - Julian Aubourg

[01:41:33] <doesallmagic> * j: adds strict rule to jshint options (except for test files). "use strict" is added to the main jQuery closure and some "could-be-unsafe" `this` trickery in effects is silenced.

[06:05:00] <DaveMethvin> .
[07:22:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you trying a new client yet?
[07:22:47] <DaveMethvin> tried quassel gnarf but it was a bit screwy for me
[07:22:53] <DaveMethvin> got pidgin running tho
[07:22:54] <DaveMethvin> i think
[07:23:04] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so long as it doesn't actually leave the channels when you close the window
[07:23:15] <gnarf> because if it does, you'll not get the important cool things about it
[07:23:33] <DaveMethvin> when you save "leave the channels" ...
[07:23:52] <gnarf> issue a "PART #jquery-dev" as you close the window :)
[07:24:03] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea if it does
[07:24:17] <DaveMethvin> if so i am sure there is a way to turn it off
[07:24:22] <DaveMethvin> or some half-ass plugin
[07:24:25] <DaveMethvin> ?D
[07:24:25] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, No results found for ''.
[07:24:29] <DaveMethvin> :D
[07:24:31] <gnarf> it did last time, try quitting pidgin quick - i'll let you know if you leave
[07:24:41] <gnarf> or rather, whatever you were using did last time
[07:25:30] <DaveMethvin> i'll try two things, sleeping and quitting
[07:25:58] <gnarf> seems yer still here, but i dunno if u ever disconnected :)
[07:26:12] <DaveMethvin> did i part?
[07:26:22] <gnarf> nop
[07:26:25] <gnarf> yay!
[07:26:25] <DaveMethvin> ok that's good
[07:26:31] <gnarf> yer ghost was here
[07:26:32] <gnarf> ;)
[07:26:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah but nobody SAID anything so no scrollback?
[07:26:57] <gnarf> prolly not
[07:27:24] <DaveMethvin> hmm, on the other channels i got the topic again
[07:27:31] <DaveMethvin> let me try closing the windo
[07:27:34] <gnarf> yeah, thats common
[07:28:19] <gnarf> yeah, that made you part... <#jquery-meeting> DaveMethvin has left () --- Did your client have a "this server is a bouncer" option?
[07:28:38] <gnarf> maybe thats what it does
[07:28:41] <DaveMethvin> no doubt there is an option let me check
[07:28:45] <gnarf> stops you from parting
[07:29:33] <gnarf> I've heard good things about xChat as well btw
[07:29:37] <gnarf> in the realm of possible others
[07:30:18] <gnarf> http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/top-7-free-irc-clients-windows-7/
[07:30:21] <gnarf> seems pretty good list
[07:33:39] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: turns out i have to quit the client from the main window, otherwise if i close a tab or window it parts
[07:33:48] * gnarf nods
[07:33:55] <gnarf> a little "risky" but if you think you can remember ;)
[07:33:58] <DaveMethvin> usually i sleep so it wouldn't be a problem
[07:34:01] <DaveMethvin> but yeah
[07:34:12] <DaveMethvin> kind of a pain there isn't a "never part" option
[07:34:24] <DaveMethvin> we'll see if i can remember
[07:34:53] <DaveMethvin> i may try some of the others, i did about a year ago and came back to pidgin
[07:38:13] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: strange -- the IM paradigm is so broken for IRC, I'm always surprised when people use an IM client to IRC
[07:41:25] <mikesherov> hi
[07:41:35] <mikesherov> ZNC has changed my life
[07:43:41] <snover> gnarf: because no instant messaging protocols have “chat room” right :)
[07:44:21] <gnarf> snover: pretty much, IM clients are private first, IRC is room first
[07:44:47] <gnarf> AIM, GTalk, etc allow group convos, but its just like the opposite approach from IRC
[07:45:15] <snover> er
[07:45:26] <snover> it’s a room with multiple participants.
[07:45:31] <snover> how is that the opposite approach.
[07:45:47] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: even for irc clients the setup on a bouncer is pretty opaque
[07:46:07] <DaveMethvin> thank you google
[07:46:28] <DaveMethvin> i'm looking at all kinds of bug tickets where the people before me were confused just the same way
[07:48:17] <gnarf> snover: in that they focus on delivering PM where IRC focuses on rooms
[07:48:43] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah - bouncers are a little wacky :)
[07:49:23] <snover> gnarf: I’m sitting in Adium right now and has all the same UI features of a “chat program”
[07:49:46] <snover> i don’t know why you think it is different
[07:50:07] <DaveMethvin> irc is pretty much a superset of im tho, right?
[07:50:22] <DaveMethvin> im is just group chat with two people in the room :D
[07:52:14] <gnarf> snover: i dunno, maybe because I've been using IRC for 18 years and in the old days all IM programs that did IRC were super-crippled IRC clients that could barely set modes, etc
[07:52:41] <DaveMethvin> i can tell gibson0421 is playing with the bouncer too
[07:52:49] <gibson0421> :)

[14:00:41] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I also changed the default priority to be "undetermined" so that we know when things have been determined to be a priority or not. I added a report to see if there are any unprioritized tixx as well
