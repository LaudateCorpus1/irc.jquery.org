[05:30:50] <DaveMethvin> hey scott_gonzalez just let that thing die
[05:31:43] <scott_gonzalez> which thing?
[05:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> The icons?
[05:32:04] <DaveMethvin> the one on the css issue, that guy will never give up
[05:32:10] <scott_gonzalez> It seems that way.
[05:32:23] <DaveMethvin> 20 other people must be wrong
[05:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> That was my first real comment about the icons.
[05:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> I actually haven't been following the discussion.
[05:32:47] <scott_gonzalez> I've just been skimming for organizational things.
[05:33:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah, understood, he just seems bound and determined to get it his way
[05:33:13] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[05:33:15] <DaveMethvin> and everyone else is wrong about it
[05:33:44] <arschmitz> He is driving me nuts but i refuse to comment any more
[05:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: While I've got you...
[05:34:20] <scott_gonzalez> The topic in #jquery-meeting has reached its max length.
[05:34:28] <scott_gonzalez> So I can't add the Chassis meeting to the topic.
[05:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz and I both had the same idea for a solution.
[05:34:45] <scott_gonzalez> Change the topic to just reference meetings.jquery.org
[05:34:51] <DaveMethvin> agreed, was going to suggest that as well
[05:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> And then get the agenda docs listed somewhere on that site.
[05:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts about where to put those links?
[05:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> The two things I've thought of are in the details of the events on the calendar.
[05:35:37] <arschmitz> I would probably just make and weekly agends page
[05:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> or at the top of each page within a category.
[05:35:53] <scott_gonzalez> That would work too.
[05:36:07] <DaveMethvin> top of the page seems easiest
[05:37:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll try to get that done today.
[05:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> Also need to add a Chassis category so we can post the notes.
[05:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've put in my last words on the icon issue, asking him to stop holding up progress.
[06:00:48] <DaveMethvin> m_gol and gibson042, can you put together those branches for the 1.11.2/2.1.2 release? I'd like to work on it over the weekend
[06:05:24] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I'll do it for Core today
[06:05:43] <DaveMethvin> awesome, thanks ... we'll need a new Sizzle obviously as well
[06:05:48] <m_gol> sure
[06:05:59] <m_gol> I'll leave that one to gibson042 :)
[06:07:14] <gibson042> I'll branch it tomorrow after landing the cleanup PRs
[06:08:20] <DaveMethvin> sounds good, thanks!
[06:14:43] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: quick organization question
[06:15:09] <timmywil> how would you feel about including the feature test for createHTMLDocument in core/parseHTML.js?
[06:15:22] <timmywil> outside of jQuery.parseHTML() of course
[06:16:04] <timmywil> it's only used there, so the support test wouldn't have to leak into the built file when parseHTML: wasn't included
[06:17:22] <timmywil> or, I could keep it in a separate file, but only include it as a dependency of parseHTML
[06:21:03] <m_gol> timmywil: the last one seems the best IMO
[06:21:11] <timmywil> cool
[06:22:22] <DaveMethvin> sorry was afk ... it's such a tiny test, including it in parseHTML.js or doing a /var dependency is fine either way
[06:33:01] <Krinkle> Can someone edit http://blog.jquery.com/2014/12/10/qunit-1-16-release-and-roadmap/ and fix a few markup issues?
[06:33:13] <Krinkle> assert.async()  link is broken (has curly quot inside the href)
[06:33:33] <Krinkle> and code sample seems bolded, instead of highighted. Not sure that's normally the case.
[06:33:45] <Krinkle> "* QUnit.skip: " link also has a broken quote
[06:33:55] <Krinkle> "* CommonJS exports:" link is broken also
[06:34:13] <Krinkle> and all the links after that also end in a " part of the url leading to 404
[06:34:37] <Krinkle> <a href="//github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/670”">
[06:34:57] <Krinkle> Yay for using Google Docs to draft HTML with happy smart quotes :)

[15:02:22] * miketaylr shakes fist at mootools
[15:03:01] <m_gol> miketaylr: anything new?
[15:03:23] <DaveMethvin> oh crap ... no
[15:03:33] <miketaylr> m_gol: just read that incoming sizzle bug https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/303
[15:03:34] <DaveMethvin> solution: don't use mootools
[15:03:38] <miketaylr> FIXED
[15:03:46] <m_gol> DaveMethin: my computer decided it doesn't like me
[15:03:51] <m_gol> so I'm repairing it today
[15:03:54] <DaveMethvin> i have a lot of sympathy for them but really
[15:04:06] <m_gol> hence I'll get to this branch creation, cherry-picking patches etc. tomorrow
[15:04:18] <m_gol> maybe I complained too much about Safari 8
[15:04:20] <DaveMethvin> you didn't spill a coke on it did you? :)
[15:04:25] <m_gol> Yosemite took a revenge
[15:04:26] <miketaylr> honestly tho, mootools is basically at the core of all the problems in the free world
[15:04:27] <m_gol> no ;)
[15:04:36] <m_gol> it was "running out of file descriptors"
[15:04:47] <m_gol> currently I don't have half of the icons in my menu bar
[15:04:52] <miketaylr> O_o
[15:04:56] <m_gol> and Disk Utility claims disk has errors
[15:04:58] <DaveMethvin> i don't want to rag on moo too much but really, just dump it from the page if you're doing new work on it
[15:05:16] <miketaylr> just no silently as i rag on mootools
[15:05:19] <miketaylr> *nod
[15:05:36] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: been there, had a similar prob on windows and limped along for a couple of days until i cleaned it up
[15:05:38] <m_gol> using MooTools and Sizzle together
[15:05:39] <m_gol> brave
[15:05:55] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I have backups from a few days ago so I'll try to restore
[15:06:09] <m_gol> if that fails I may just kick Yosemite out and revert to Mavericks that actually worked
[15:06:14] <DaveMethvin> like why did moo think they need to "upgrade" basic functions anyway?
[15:06:16] <m_gol> from day one
[15:06:32] <miketaylr> yosemite has been really crappy for me
[15:06:49] <DaveMethvin> kborchers has had a bunch of trouble as well
[15:07:02] <DaveMethvin> so he went to disneyworld for a week :)
[15:07:23] <m_gol> when I scroll in WebStorm, the whole screen flashes
[15:07:39] <m_gol> Mission Control performance is, like, 100x worse
[15:07:43] <DaveMethvin> signs of impending disaster
[15:07:49] <m_gol> I have the last non-retina MacBook Pro, from 2012
[15:07:59] <m_gol> but my friend has just bought the newest Retina one
[15:08:00] <DaveMethvin> next time you come here you need to get a new one
[15:08:03] <m_gol> and it's not smooth there either
[15:08:14] <m_gol> ;)
[15:08:24] <m_gol> and let's not remember: Yosemite brought us all Safari 8
[15:08:34] <m_gol> the crappity crap edition
[15:08:34] <DaveMethvin> AAAUUUUGH
[15:08:42] <m_gol> * let's not forget
[15:08:51] <m_gol> my subconscious is trying to choose the easier solution
[15:08:54] <DaveMethvin> Safari Significant Regressions Edition
[15:09:50] <m_gol> I'll just restore to Yosemite from 2 days ago for now; we'll see if it deserves to stay
[15:09:55] <m_gol> otherwise no Santa
[15:15:10] <m_gol> new iOS8 patch went out
[15:15:18] <m_gol> no fix for the qsa bug, obviously
