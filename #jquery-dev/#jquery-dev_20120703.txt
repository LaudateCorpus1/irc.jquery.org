[11:29:20] <DaveMethvin> Thanks for this jQuery bug, we're really sorry, have a hug, to figure out this problem best, we sure could use some code to test
[11:29:30] <DaveMethvin> oh just one more important bit, be sure to use jquery-git
[11:30:13] <rwaldron> gnarf i just have a text file on my desktop
[11:30:27] <rwaldron> i tihnk everyone has just been copy/pasting

[11:35:23] <DaveMethvin> go fer it
[11:35:50] <timmywil> actually, this might be a good time to give me access :)
[11:36:09] <DaveMethvin> lemme see if i can do that :)
[11:36:19] <gnarf> timmywil: it wont matter in like a week
[11:36:27] <gnarf> or whenever we switch to the new system
[11:36:37] <gnarf> you'll be posting blog posts via github anyway

[12:30:43] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: have you uploaded the videos from dramatic bugs yet? :)
[12:31:00] <ryanneufeld> no, I need to figure out how to get them off the playbook
[12:31:10] <ryanneufeld> and they need to be edited a bit or I'd just put em on youtubes
[12:31:11] <gnarf> lol
[12:31:27] <ryanneufeld> it's an interesting device
[12:31:32] <mikesherov> hi
[12:31:38] <mikesherov> I was just playing with johhny-five
[12:31:40] <ryanneufeld> now that I have one, i wouldn't pay for one :p
[12:31:49] <ryanneufeld> mikesherov: o/
[12:31:56] <mikesherov> \o
[12:32:04] <ryanneufeld> pretty neat stuff
[12:32:16] <mikesherov> bot-t: hi5 ryanneufeld
[12:32:18] <bot-t> mikesherov, Couldn't find "hi5 ryanneufeld" in jQuery Docs.
[12:32:20] <ryanneufeld> what I'd love is if there was a way to transpile to C/C++
[12:32:31] <mikesherov> there are lots of bugs in the led examples
[12:32:49] <ryanneufeld> mikesherov: how you tell bot-t to send stuff to channels?
[12:32:58] <mikesherov> the led commands that setInterval need to have clearInterval (via .stop) called
[12:33:05] <mikesherov> I dunno
[12:33:20] <ryanneufeld> ?hi5 @ mikesherov
[12:33:21] <bot-t> mikesherov, ⋰⁵⋱
[12:34:08] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11992 is a dupe, and I think it works in edge, no?
[12:34:32] <ryanneufeld> I haven't had much time to play with johny five, but I've been figting bronchitis
[12:37:43] <gnarf> ?slap @#jquery

[12:37:57] <gnarf> but you can only do that if you are a op in the channel
[12:38:30] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: hehehehe, that's gonna be too much fun
[12:38:48] * ryanneufeld looks for coldhead
[12:39:46] <ryanneufeld> bot-tYou must have +v in #jquery to be able to do that. :(

[13:18:04] <DaveMethvin> sure, a 4th of july post is fine
[13:18:37] <DaveMethvin> that way we will all have a sizzling hot 4th
[13:18:49] <timmywil> oo, I'm putting that in there

[13:40:15] <Krinkle> Hm.. didn't we fix $foo.data( 'key', undefined )
[13:40:28] <Krinkle> Its not working as expected in 1.7.2
[13:41:09] <Krinkle> ah, I see
[13:41:15] <Krinkle> setting to undefined will set it to undefined
[13:41:22] <Krinkle> but still makes it fallback to the attribute
[13:41:56] <Krinkle> so $('<div data-foo="hello"></div>').data( 'foo', undefined ).data( 'foo' ) !== undefined
[13:42:05] <Krinkle> bug? or expected behavior?
[13:42:15] <Krinkle> I'd say only removeData() should make it go back to attribute lookup

[20:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell DaveMethvin I want to change the copyright on all jQuery projects. Ideally before core 1.8, UI 1.9, color 2.0, mobile 1.1.1. Ping me when you're around.
[20:01:47] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[20:02:15] <DaveMethvin> I'm here scott_gonzalez, just hosing up some code

[20:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[20:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> Can we change all projects to "Copyright jQuery Foundation and other contributors"
[20:02:47] <DaveMethvin> changing a copyright sounds like something I could actually accomplish!
[20:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> Remove the lie that we've perpetuated for years.
[20:03:04] <DaveMethvin> can we just do that?
[20:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[20:03:14] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually correct, as opposed to what we have now :-P
[20:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> And our CLA doesn't transfer ownership, so that won't change anything.
[20:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> The copyright will still be spread among hundreds of people.
[20:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> We had also discussed dropping GPL at some point.
[20:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be nice, but I'm not as concerned.
[20:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> If we don't, we should probably upgrade to GPLv3 :-P
[20:06:36] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: it's just in the mit-license.txt?

[20:22:16] <DaveMethvin> i was experimenting with the coward's unit test repair method
[20:22:17] <snover> 70–85% of the things?
[20:22:30] <DaveMethvin> kind of a fuckit.js algorithm
[20:22:54] <DaveMethvin> delete tests and see if the problem moves elsewhere
[20:23:22] <snover> awesome
[20:23:25] <snover> how is it working out for you?
