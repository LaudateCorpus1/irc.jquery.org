[08:22:38] <ctc> I have problems with slow (1-2seconds) checkboxes "click" on a page with many (>1000) checkboxes and jquery loaded, but also slow when all jquery click events are disabled
[09:43:33] <scott_gonzalez> ctc: Support is in #jquery.
[09:50:50] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: the Foundation should be getting a dime for every such sentence on IRC ;)
[13:16:01] <dcherman2> out of curiosity, are the AMD exports for jQuery no longer tested?  can't find any links to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/exports.js in any test files
[13:18:43] <dcherman2> testswarm doesn't know an exports module being run either
[13:18:47] <dcherman2> s/know/show
[13:29:12] <DaveMethvin> dcherman2: we don't have any tests for that ... do you have some suggestions to do it? for example, browserify, node, etc
[13:29:28] <DaveMethvin> i don't think those need to be run in all browsers necessarily
[13:30:13] <dcherman2> DaveMethvin: nah, not specifically.  i was just looking to steal the methodology for testing the exports for a toolkit i develop at my job and noticed that exports.js from the testsuite is never referenced
[13:30:23] <DaveMethvin> haha
[13:30:38] <DaveMethvin> well you're gonna need to do it YOURSELF and let US know! :)
[13:30:46] <dcherman2> yessir!
[13:30:54] <DaveMethvin> and make it snappy!
[13:30:57] <DaveMethvin> :P
