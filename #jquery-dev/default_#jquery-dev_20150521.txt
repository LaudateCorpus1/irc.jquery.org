[08:33:31] <gnarf> hey gibson042 - you around?
[08:33:40] <gibson042> yeah, mostly
[08:34:02] <gnarf> can you think of other parts of $.Animation I should do more thorough testing of?
[08:34:12] <gnarf> and have you looked over the last PR?
[08:34:21] <gnarf> also - added some thoughts to your ticket
[08:40:48] <gibson042> wow, that PR grew :)
[08:41:19] <gibson042> it's covering Animation methods and Tween pretty thoroughly
[08:41:26] <gibson042> I can't see any gaps right now
[08:47:26] <gnarf> gibson042: had an open source week - the client I'm on had vacation this week
[08:47:27] <gnarf> :)
[08:47:37] <gnarf> gibson042: spent a few days down here...
[08:47:45] <gnarf> So do I need to backport this to compat also?
[08:47:51] <gnarf> I'm out of touch with jQuery core 
[08:47:58] <gnarf> haven't had the time to keep up to date :(
[08:48:24] <m_gol> gnarf: yes, we need this on both branches
[08:48:40] <gibson042> yeah, cherry-picking to compat is basically the last step before pushing/closing
[08:49:21] <m_gol> we usually cherry-pick ourselves unless the code is different enough that it's not so automatic
[08:53:49] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15gnarf opened pull request #2340: Effects Tests (compat) (06compat...06effects-tests-compat) 02http://git.io/vTrv2
[08:57:26] <gnarf> also can I say that â™¥ sinon https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2326/files#diff-a9b51b165b1b5e6371b04162c3981403R102 ;)
[08:58:22] <gnarf> m_gol: was pretty straightforward... rebase --onto only had like 2 tiny merge cpnflicts
