[05:25:33] <markelog> timmywil: hey there
[05:25:38] <markelog> you here?
[05:28:02] <markelog> DaveMethvin: ping
[05:28:15] <DaveMethvin> whatup?
[05:29:57] <markelog> we have three deprecated jqXHR methods
[05:30:07] <markelog> sucess, error and complete
[05:30:17] <markelog> i wounder if it's time to remove them?
[05:30:55] <DaveMethvin> it would be fine with me, but check with timmywil ... maybe make an issue for it?
[05:31:14] <markelog> yeah, that is what i'm about to do :)
[05:31:57] <DaveMethvin> definitely good to move people towards the standard Promise methods, so it seems like a good time now that our .then() is standard
[05:32:26] <markelog> seems like it!
[05:32:49] <markelog> we would need a ticket for migrate and docs too i guess
[05:33:41] <DaveMethvin> oh good point ... we can put in the check for migrate now since they are already deprecated
[05:34:55] <markelog> so we would need a ticket to migrate anyway
[05:35:06] <DaveMethvin> right
[05:35:18] <DaveMethvin> we only need a docs ticket if we decide to remove it
[05:35:27] <DaveMethvin> since it is already noted as deprecated
[05:36:26] <markelog> i even wounder if it would be a good idea to deprecate jQuery#load
[05:36:56] <markelog> seems as a weird use case
[05:37:29] <DaveMethvin> and it tempts people to insert entire documents into other docs ... you could open a ticket or just discuss on Monday
[05:38:08] <markelog> yeah, okay, will sleep on it )

[09:02:57] <jzaefferer> I guess leobalter could rant about how shitty QUnit's code base, preventing using ES6 modules. Not sure there's something else to talk about
[09:03:20] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: I hope you can restart the jsreporter effort sometime this quarter
