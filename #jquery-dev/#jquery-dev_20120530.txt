[06:36:44] <scott_gonzalez> HAHAHA http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10137
[06:37:07] <scott_gonzalez> If you guys are intentionally holding back important information about breaking changes, could you please tell me?
[06:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> sindresorhus: What are they changes that anonymous comes back and asks you to show just the changes related to the memory leak?
[06:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> s/changes/chanches/
[06:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> jeez
[06:43:35] <sindresorhus> scott_gonzalez:  But I won't take all the fun from him
[06:43:38] <sindresorhus> ;)
[07:24:46] <Krinkle> .
[07:24:46] <ircjsbot> Krinkle, you have one new message, from snover (13 hours and 44 minutes ago). Tell me if you want to read it (“read”).
[07:24:58] <Krinkle> since when does it ask
[07:25:02] <Krinkle> read!
[07:25:04] <Krinkle> read
[07:25:07] <Krinkle> . read
[07:25:11] <Krinkle> !read
[07:25:15] <Krinkle> ircjsbot: read
[07:25:15] <ircjsbot> Krinkle, from snover, 13 hours and 44 minutes ago: “I like the new jslint design actually” basically invalidates your opinion on all graphic design for eternity :)
[07:26:43] <Krinkle> ?tell snover I didn't say it was good, I said I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it – better than the previous design. There's still plenty of details I'd do different
[07:27:22] <Krinkle> ircjsbot: tell foo bar
[07:27:22] <ircjsbot> Krinkle, OK, I will tell foo if I see them.
[07:27:54] <Krinkle> ircjsbot: tell snover I didn't say it was good, I said I like it. I like it. I like it... I like it – better than the previous design. There's still plenty of details I don't like.
[07:27:55] <ircjsbot> Krinkle, OK, I will tell snover if I see them.
[07:28:07] <Krinkle> ircjsbot: tell snover I
[07:28:07] <ircjsbot> Krinkle, OK, I will tell snover if I see them.
[07:28:08] <Krinkle> ircjsbot: tell snover like
[07:28:09] <ircjsbot> Krinkle, OK, I will tell snover if I see them.
[07:28:10] <Krinkle> ircjsbot: tell snover it
[07:28:10] <ircjsbot> Krinkle, OK, I will tell snover if I see them.
[07:28:15] <Krinkle> :)
[07:44:16] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Chrome is all busted http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8368#comment:7
[07:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know where that bug report would have gone?
[07:49:19] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: did you get TestSwarm fixed?
[07:49:24] <scott_gonzalez> It seems to be happier.
[07:49:34] <Krinkle> I rebooted mysqld with a few tweaks for tracking
[07:49:42] <Krinkle> didn't find the cause, but we will next time
[07:49:52] <Krinkle> also gonna do show proceslist next time before killing mysql
[07:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> What the average time for that query now?
[07:50:21] <Krinkle> 0.0x
[07:50:22] <Krinkle> instead of 40-70.x
[07:50:23] <Krinkle> :D
[07:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:51:11] <scott_gonzalez> So we've still go almost a thousand pending runs. Can we clear that out somehow?
[07:51:17] <scott_gonzalez> Without totally killing the existing data.
[07:51:24] <Krinkle> new jobs always have priority
[07:51:28] <Krinkle> it'll catch up naturally
[07:51:34] <scott_gonzalez> heh, ok
[07:52:06] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it wouldn't be a bad idea to have allow limiting how many tests back it will go.
[07:52:19] <Krinkle> There's an odd pending run in Firefox 11 and 12 that I can quite figure out
[07:52:24] <Krinkle> can't*
[07:53:47] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: I'm not sure why we would need that. An expiry could be implemented on the job overall. but 1) we already have a time out on Jenkins, so it won't stall the build now, 2) When using test results in retrospect (e.g. 2 weeks later), then having complete results is probably more valuable.
[07:54:34] <Krinkle> older tests just catch up in the background in the idle time
[07:56:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not worried about #1 since that's already handled. I just feel like #2 is unlikely to be an issue.
[07:56:48] <scott_gonzalez> Can you even navigate to older jobs?
[07:56:53] <Krinkle> Yes
[07:56:55] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui only shows recent jobs.
[07:57:08] <Krinkle> that's just the /user/ page being too simplistic
[07:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> If there's no nav for it, it's not really that helpful.
[07:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> You'd be manually bisecting URLs
[07:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> might as well just bisect in git.
[07:57:43] <Krinkle> So just because nobody spent the 5 minutes to add pagination, we should drop them entirely?
[07:57:53] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't say that.
[07:57:56] <Krinkle> the job pages are there, we'll add pagination soon
[07:58:05] <scott_gonzalez> I said if they're really old and they haven't run, don't bother running them.
[07:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> For example, I will not care what the remaining results of http://swarm.jquery.org/job/140 actually are
[07:59:03] <Krinkle> "really old" would be hard to define. And it doesn't cost anything to keep it this way. They don't take over priority. And whenever we're bisecting an old issue, it would be useful to be able to trace when it started.
[07:59:20] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: I disagree
[07:59:26] <Krinkle> IE6 has been off for a while due to the attributes failures
[07:59:39] <Krinkle> as a result 'core" hasn't run for most jobs on IE6 either
[07:59:56] <Krinkle> It it turns out there is a test failure for that module in IE6, we need to trace it
[07:59:59] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: As the person that would need to fix it, I don't care about the old resutls.
[08:00:07] <scott_gonzalez> We really don't need to trace it.
[08:00:22] <Krinkle> by musing clicking a few kicks back on swamr, you'd find that.
[08:00:36] <Krinkle> So, ignore them if you don't need it?
[08:01:40] <Krinkle> I see a use for them, you don't. But there's no _problem_ with just letting it finish in the background.
[08:01:56] <timmywil> .
[08:05:33] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: also, in the long term this will be a non-issue. If it weren't for the IE6 issues, we could just require Jenkins to wait until the swarm build is complete. Which is our goal anyway. There shouldn't be able to be any old runs while development continues. We're currently still a bit in a transition phase from doing tests aside, to making it part of the default contribution/merge/build flow.

[08:32:10] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: actually there is at 1pm, if you and/or rwaldron could make it that would be great
[08:32:24] <DaveMethvin> i am on a plane and will be landing around that time

[08:33:37] <DaveMethvin> well darn i can't git push from the airplane wifi :D

[11:17:43] <jq-jenkins> timmywillisn: Remove the tabindex attrHook. Fixes #8473
[11:25:58] <timmywil> it seems jquery-git.js isn't updateing
[11:26:01] <timmywil> updating*
[11:26:33] <timmywil> er, wait
[11:26:57] <timmywil> yes, not updating
[11:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Yeah, infra knows about it.
[11:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> It broke with the update to grunt.
[11:32:22] <scott_gonzalez> They're working on it.
[11:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> Also, it's pretty amazing that we're -.5kb from 1.7.2.

[12:33:26] <jq-jenkins> timmywillisn: Adjust the return type for the tabindex attribute tests to be a string. Recomment a tabindex test since FF12's QSA includes video elements that don't have a tabindex attribute.
[12:47:38] <timmywil> it would seem that swarm unfortunately needs a timeout larger than 30min
[12:47:51] <timmywil> jenkins
[13:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Or you can just delete some tests :-P
[13:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> You can delete the code associated with whatever tests you remove too.
[13:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> Would help slim down core.
[13:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> There's an idea, prune features based on how long it takes to run the associated tests...
[13:05:26] <David_Souther> git rm -rf test/ && git commit && git push
[13:05:26] <David_Souther> Swarm passes in 0 minutes!
[13:05:32] <timmywil> sry everyone, ajax took too long
[13:06:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's good that it's a build option. Gives people a chance to get ready :-P
[13:06:29] <David_Souther> Etsy does some nice stuff in deployinator to skip the 1% or 10% of longest-running tests for normal builds
[21:41:12] <Corey> So, who's up for some fun? :-)
[21:50:00] <snover> at least take me out to dinner first
[21:51:27] <gf3> Corey === gnarf
[21:51:29] <gf3> ???
[21:51:44] <Corey> So funny story.
[21:51:53] <Corey> (mt) is EOLing older (dv) instances.
[21:52:12] <gf3> (lol)
[21:52:19] <Corey> Including api.jquery.com, blog.jquery.com, download-ui.jquery.com, jquery.com, planet.jquery.com, plugins-db.jquery.com, plugins.jquery.com, staging.jquery.com, swarm-01.host.jquery.com, themeroller-ui.jquery.com, ui.jquery.com
[21:52:24] <Corey> In two days.
[21:54:03] <Corey> Yeah, I'm making some calls.
[21:57:46] <snover> so, what…they made an announcement and nobody paid attention, or they don’t know how to manage customer relations, or…?
[22:01:43] <gf3> Somebody ping dainbrain?
[22:02:33] <snover> you know what i like
[22:02:34] <snover> linode
[22:07:01] <gf3> Yeah but he works there
[22:07:38] <snover> yeah but then there’s linode
[22:09:48] <gf3> snover: Valid point, I have no argument with that
[22:09:56] <snover> thought so!
[22:11:34] <snover> I’m just saying, one of these companies discontinues products and then doesn’t make sure people are migrated
[22:11:56] <snover> the other one puts a big-ass thing on your dashboard saying they will auto-migrate your node at a point in the future if you don’t do it first
[22:12:34] <gf3> And then they double your RAM
[22:12:43] <snover> and then they give you 20% more disk space
[22:13:44] <snover> and then they forget to enable STP and accidentally create a network loop that scuttles half their routing equipment in one of their NOCs…oh, wait a second…
[22:14:10] <snover> it was at least a highly redundant network loop
[22:14:21] <snover> I always like it when the solution to a problem is having someone go and unplug something though
[22:14:34] <gf3> snover: I feel like that's always the solution
[22:14:44] <snover> it so often is!
[22:33:57] <Corey> Indeed.
[23:29:17] <Corey> (mt) is going to make it right, yay.
