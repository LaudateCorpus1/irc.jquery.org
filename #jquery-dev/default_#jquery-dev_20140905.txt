[06:16:40] <gibson042> :)
[06:16:44] <gibson042> this is the traditional place for a "great minds" comment ;)
[06:17:50] <JamesMGreene> You beat me by 19 seconds :)
[06:18:22] <JamesMGreene> Though you also mentioned adding a comment, so kudos to you
[06:20:03] <gibson042> you win on phrasing, though
[06:22:54] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell snover I'm not sure that combobox is meant to be used on a wrapper. Perhaps mark the input as role="presentation"? That may really screw things up though since it is the editable portion of the widget. Perhaps using aria-controls or aria-owns to associate the input with the wrapper will help.
[06:22:54] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I‚Äôll tell snover about that.
[06:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell snover In practice, we've just hacked around autocomplete using live regions because the support for properly following ARIA recommendations was pretty terrible.
[06:23:28] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I‚Äôll tell snover about that.
[06:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell snover I'm not sure if b-ot captured both of my messages. You might want to check the logs.
[06:23:46] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I‚Äôll tell snover about that.
[06:24:03] <DaveMethvin> WAKE UP BOT!
[06:27:11] <gibson042> message #3 mentions "both" messages... I think scott_gonzalez is trying to logic bomb
[06:29:12] <DaveMethvin> typical scott_gonzalez, off by one error
[06:29:21] <scott_gonzalez> It's a subpixel error.
[08:35:48] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer leobalter Krinkle|detached scott_gonzalez gibson042: Any further review for the `assert.async` PR? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/653
[08:44:52] <JamesMGreene> leobalter: Shouldn't JSCS catch those?
[08:46:05] <gibson042> code looks good to me
[08:46:08] <leobalter> JSCS is not perfect, one thing that might help is ESFormatter, but it's not 100% to use it into QUnit, but good to start a new project as the js-reporter
[08:46:49] <leobalter> s/JSCS is not perfect/JSCS is not a silver bullet/
[08:59:11] <snover> scott_gonzalez: got them, thanks.
[08:59:42] <snover> it‚Äôs amazing to me that there are open standards that are even worse than the core DOM experience, but, there you go
[09:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> ARIA is nothing but a pain.
[09:01:27] <scott_gonzalez> A lot of our widgets devolve to hacks over time.

[09:01:52] <snover> which is insane considering how simple the api is
[09:02:59] <snover> with web audio (actually wasn‚Äôt there even a TTS API proposal at one point?) and dom mutation observers, someone could probably write a fully-featured javascript screen reader in a month

[09:04:25] <snover> JamesMGreene: no kidding‚Ä¶
[09:04:28] <snover> yeah, Web Speech API
[09:04:42] <JamesMGreene> Totally agree, though

[09:09:44] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer leobalter Krinkle|detached scott_gonzalez: Can someone explain to me why https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/501 needs to be milestoned as `v2.1.0` instead of just `v2.0`?
[09:11:10] <JamesMGreene> Well
[09:11:55] <JamesMGreene> I see the documentation note of wanting v2.0 to throw an Error and then removing it in v2.1.  I suppose that makes sense for function parameters in particular
[09:17:12] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15JamesMGreene labeled issue #657: Remove private `async` parameter from `QUnit.test` 02http://git.io/-UC2nQ
[09:17:39] <JamesMGreene> More importantly, jqcommit, I CREATED issue #657  ;)
[11:00:48] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: yeah, pretty much. 2.0 will be backwards incompatible, but helps with the migration. Like someone telling you your drivers license is expired, and helping you to get a new one
[12:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: JSCS needs a check for `foo ()`
