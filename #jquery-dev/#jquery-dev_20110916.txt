[08:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: yt?
[11:50:42] <cnnr> just a random question - are you all planning on making .attr like .css, where you can pass in a mapped Object, instead of having to do multiple .attr calls on separate lines?
[11:55:33] <kborchers> cnnr: you can already do that see ?attr
[11:55:33] <bot-t> cnnr, .attr(attributeName): Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[11:56:30] <cnnr> <facepalm /> - my bad. thank you!

[15:50:52] <gnarf> timmywil: hey had a question if you're around
[15:51:08] <gnarf> timmywil: should i base my new pulls against 1.7/combined ?
[15:51:32] <gnarf> should avoid some potential merge conflicts right?
[16:55:09] <gnarf> ?tell timmywil hey - for the other 1.7 pulls I'm working on - do you want me to base them on 1.7/combined or master?
[16:55:09] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
