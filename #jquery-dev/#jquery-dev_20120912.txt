[05:36:18] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[06:09:16] <SteveC> Using jquery forms to convert a form to ajax - is it possible to reset it back to being a regular form afterwards?

[06:39:39] <gnarf> mikesherov: yeah?
[06:39:53] <gnarf> mikesherov: we want to work on one that uses the new status API
[06:39:55] <gnarf> :)
[06:40:13] <mikesherov> yes
[06:40:19] <mikesherov> mergeatron does that
[06:40:31] <gnarf> nice you guys got it implemented
[06:40:34] <mikesherov> http://github.com/snapinteractive/mergeatron
[06:40:39] <mikesherov> we implemented it day 1
[06:41:06] <mikesherov> I'm putting together a readme on getting it set up over lunch
[06:41:12] <mikesherov> I'll love for it to work for jQuery
[06:41:39] <mikesherov> right now it automatically polls ever x seconds/minutes for updated or submitted pulls
[06:42:00] <gnarf> mind if I ask why you need mongo on it?
[06:42:19] <mikesherov> and runs whenever new PR's exist, new commits or rebases happen, or a comment happens asking it to retest
[06:42:32] <mikesherov> it needs mongo to comment on lines and keep tracks of SHA's
[06:43:03] <mikesherov> we have plugins to use JSHint directly
[06:43:15] <mikesherov> and it can comment directly on line numbers
[06:43:33] <gnarf> I'm a little afraid of putting mongo on any of the current live servers, it can be a memory hog
[06:43:45] <gnarf> and (mt) servers are well, really bad about memory
[06:43:49] <gnarf> no swap files, etc
[06:43:52] <mikesherov> it is certainly a memory hog
[06:43:59] <mikesherov> it is designed to be
[06:44:06] <gnarf> yup
[06:44:11] <mikesherov> so, I'll see if we could rip that out
[06:44:52] <mikesherov> would you be comfortable with mysql? postgre? flat file?
[06:45:11] <gnarf> mysql would work, its already on the machine I'd install it on
[06:45:12] <gnarf> also
[06:45:34] <gnarf> i see it ties in through jenkins, which seems interesting
[06:46:15] <mikesherov> yes
[06:46:24] <mikesherov> so it can do just jenkins too
[06:46:31] <mikesherov> it can do jenkins and others directly
[06:46:41] <mikesherov> but it's mainly built to fire off a jenkins job
[06:46:50] <mikesherov> like bot.io
[06:47:14] <gnarf> bot.io just fires off a js script
[06:47:17] <mikesherov> it merges and fires a jenkins job at the merged code
[06:47:33] <mikesherov> I'll get you more information later today
[06:47:40] <mikesherov> just wanted to see if you guys were interested
[06:49:36] <gnarf> seems like a good start
[06:49:41] <mikesherov> cool
[06:53:55] <gnarf> mikesherov: sent you some pms
[06:53:55] <bot-t> (1 hour 17 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell gnarf ping me when you get a moment, I'd like to talk to you about an alternative to bot.io for jQuery
[06:54:05] <gnarf> lol bot-t
[06:54:05] <bot-t> function _(l){return l+(_+l)[11-((_._=(_._?_._:!_)+1)%(1+1)?!1:1+1+1+1+1)]}_(_(_('')))

[10:24:29] <scott_gonzalez> Does IE7 have compatibility view?
[10:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> I thought that was just IE8+
[10:26:04] <gnarf> maybe they meant "IE7 compat" mode for "ie8" ?
[10:26:08] <gnarf> i don't think it did
[10:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> They were apparently using IE9 in IE7 compat mode, but they specifically said they were using IE7.
[11:01:01] <snover> scott_gonzalez: on a very superficial level, everyone running in quirks mode is running in IE5.5 compat mode
[11:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, well the bug they claim exists doens't seem to be reproducible outside of quirks mode.
[11:02:48] <ryanneufeld> .
[11:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'm waiting for a response from the reporter...
[11:05:39] <gnarf> i love how ryanneufeld's . seems like such an impressive statement based on scott_gonzalez's previous line...
[11:07:21] <ryanneufeld> lol gnarf
[11:07:51] <gnarf> was pretty much my reaction to the quirks mode comment
[11:07:52] <gnarf> .
[11:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, it gets even better.
[11:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> It's only in 64bit IE9 in compatibility mode.

[13:38:21] <gibson042> timmywil yt?
[13:38:32] <timmywil> yo
[13:38:59] <gibson042> I pulled speed/ from your pull-151 branch, but don't see any data when I open it
[13:39:24] <timmywil> run from a local server?
[13:39:39] <gibson042> yep
[13:39:46] <timmywil> not jquery's speed?
[13:40:03] <gibson042> the only thing between Note and Legend is a horizontal line
[13:40:13] <timmywil> what's the console say
[13:40:46] <gibson042> hrm
[13:40:55] <gibson042> benchmark.js dir is empty
[13:41:00] <timmywil> oh right
[13:41:03] <timmywil> git submodule update
[13:41:11] <gibson042> yeah
[13:41:12] <timmywil> --init
[13:41:14] * gibson042 slaps head
