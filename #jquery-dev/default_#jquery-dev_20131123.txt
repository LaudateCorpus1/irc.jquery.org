[14:56:07] <m_gol> but bugging from time to time may be beneficial anyway ;)
[15:00:43] <johnkpaul> m_gol: :) ok thanks
[15:00:59] <johnkpaul> I haven't actually bugged before, but I will continue every once in a while
[15:01:22] <m_gol> johnkpaul: it's hard to find true bugging balance but you're doing great so far ;D
[17:28:30] <DaveMethvin> johnkpaul m_gol any objections to landing this weekend?
[17:28:41] <DaveMethvin> and thanks for the reminder, don't want it to get stale
[17:52:02] <johnkpaul> DaveMethvin: no objection from me. I didn't check if I need to re-rebase though
