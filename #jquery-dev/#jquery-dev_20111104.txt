[04:20:59] <addyosmani> Hey kswe
[04:21:03] <addyosmani> *kswedberg
[04:21:04] <addyosmani> even
[04:21:20] <addyosmani> Doh. He isn't around.
[04:23:14] <Jakey> jquery sucks
[04:24:02] <addyosmani> INORITE
[05:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> does anyone know of a good BigNumber of BigDecimal implementation for JS?
[05:43:58] <JKarsrud> can anyone in here confirm if this is a bug? http://jsfiddle.net/beyondsanity/ZA45d/20/
[05:44:30] <JKarsrud> It's an accordion-thingy, so just click the header to show some more content, then click it again to hide it
[05:44:59] <JKarsrud> then if you click the header one more time, something doesn't seem right.. Don't know if it's a jQuery bug or not
[05:45:03] <JKarsrud> with .stop()
[06:03:05] <JKarsrud> mekwall just confirmed it wasn't :) It was a bug in the plugin code, sorry :)
[06:23:08] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: can you take a look at docs#10666 ?
[06:23:10] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, [#10666] event.metaKey returns false when ctrl key is down (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/10666
[06:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand, he's saying that even if you use the ctrl key on Windows, that event.metaKey doesn't get set?
[06:26:01] <DaveMethvin> well...
[06:26:12] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure what he's saying, other than sortable is broken with 1.7
[06:26:28] <DaveMethvin> i am only touching .metaKey if it was undefined now
[06:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> well, he's mixing plugins in that ticket
[06:26:47] <scott_gonzalez> I think he's actually talking about selectable
[06:26:59] <DaveMethvin> oh that makes sense
[06:27:13] <scott_gonzalez> also, what's up with the comment?
[06:27:22] <scott_gonzalez> saying that it doesn't work even with older jQuery
[06:27:50] <kborchers> actually he said it doesn't wok so maybe he's trying to cook with it?
[06:28:03] <DaveMethvin> lol
[06:28:11] <DaveMethvin> you so funny kborchers
[06:28:16] <kborchers> i try
[06:28:26] <DaveMethvin> well his two demos do demonstrate breakage
[06:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> works for me
[06:29:13] <DaveMethvin> on a mac, right?
[06:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> using ctrl key in IE 6
[06:29:19] <DaveMethvin> i'm on windows
[06:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> in a VM
[06:29:25] <kborchers> works for me too on win7
[06:29:31] <kborchers> chrome
[06:29:55] <kborchers> does not work with 1.7
[06:29:59] <kborchers> but old one works
[06:30:17] <DaveMethvin> kborchers: right
[06:30:23] <DaveMethvin> also doesn't work on ff
[06:30:27] <DaveMethvin> in 1.7
[06:30:38] <scott_gonzalez> it's working for me in IE 6
[06:31:06] <DaveMethvin> i think the mac must do some kb mapping in vms, b/c it is defnitely broken on windows
[06:31:49] <scott_gonzalez> attempting through BrowserStack :-P
[06:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> weird, ctrl+click goes through as a right click
[06:32:40] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.selectable.js#L121
[06:33:34] <DaveMethvin> since the browser is saying metakey==false, i am not clobbering that value anymore
[06:34:13] <DaveMethvin> used to be that if metaKey==false, we set it to ctrlKey's value
[06:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> would that mean that metaKey isn't getting normalized properly?
[06:35:36] <DaveMethvin> is metaKey supposed to be ctrlKey on Windows?
[06:37:44] <rwaldron> yeesh
[06:37:59] <rwaldron> Good morning
[06:38:09] <DaveMethvin> says who? :D
[06:38:47] <rwaldron> Hey man, I was just trying to be positive
[06:39:26] <DaveMethvin> btw rwaldron i saw your ticket about clicking on a video tag ... those ff guys didn't quite get it did they
[06:39:36] <rwaldron> Not even kind of
[06:39:55] <rwaldron> :(
[06:40:05] <rwaldron> also, they've ignored it since middle of october
[06:40:25] <rwaldron> thinking about that ticket makes me feel anxious
[06:40:42] <rwaldron> b/c on the one hand, I think I've given them enough opportunity to rectify
[06:40:57] <rwaldron> and I should start shouting from the rooftops about i
[06:40:59] <rwaldron> it*
[06:41:25] <rwaldron> on the other hand, I'm both involved with a Mozilla project and don't want to be a troll
[06:43:10] <rwaldron> also, why do people always want to submit patches for tickets assigned to me?
[06:43:25] <DaveMethvin> because they love you?
[06:43:27] <DaveMethvin> hey scott_gonzalez, here is the original ticket ... i am not sure why that code would fail unless my observations are wrong http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3368#comment:23
[06:43:42] <rwaldron> I feel like it happens to me disproportionately more often then anyone else here
[06:46:38] <DaveMethvin> i've got a breakpoint set in selectable and metaKey is true when i have ctrl held down, just the way i'd want it to be. ??
[06:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: this isn't very helpful: http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#events-KeyboardEvent-metaKey
[06:47:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah, agreed
[06:47:30] <DaveMethvin> but now i am wondering why this fails at all
[06:47:47] <DaveMethvin> b/c all the browsers seem to treat meta/ctrl the same on windows
[06:48:48] <scott_gonzalez> don't know, it works for me in my VMs :-P
[06:51:35] <DaveMethvin> ok well i see that metaKey is incorrectly false
[06:51:44] <DaveMethvin> so now i have to figure out why
[06:52:07] <rwaldron> psst DaveMethvin ... when you have a sec, ping me
[06:56:14] <DaveMethvin> arrrg scott_gonzalez: ctrlKey and metaKey are not moving in unison
[06:56:40] <scott_gonzalez> the spec doesn't really say when meta should be true
[06:56:50] <scott_gonzalez> there's no definition of what the meta key is
[06:57:00] <DaveMethvin> well it's when the keyboard-defined meta key is held down i guess :P
[06:57:15] <DaveMethvin> but the problem is, on windows there is no defined meta key
[06:57:30] <DaveMethvin> ctrl is true/false as you'd expect
[06:58:03] <DaveMethvin> but the previous code also did metaKey=ctrlKey IFF metaKey was false
[06:58:20] <DaveMethvin> which is the "bug" that was reported and fixed
[06:58:43] <DaveMethvin> so i have no idea what the desired behavior is here
[07:00:00] <timmywil> the old check is probably better
[07:00:06] <timmywil> I'm not sure we can get it perfect
[07:00:37] <DaveMethvin> if there was some way to check the platform i could always set metaKey=ctrlKey on windows
[07:00:47] <timmywil> It seems like the problem is that metaKey is not undefined, but still needs to be assigned to ctrlKey
[07:01:16] <DaveMethvin> if ( navigator.userAgent.indexof("Windows") ) ... NAH
[07:01:33] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: exactly
[07:01:33] <timmywil> checking undefined fixes some situations where metaKey should be false instead of undefined, but that's not as big of a deal
[07:02:38] <timmywil> hmm, on the other hand, metaKey should be false on a mac even when ctrl is true
[07:03:05] <DaveMethvin> which was the bug originally reported in 3368
[07:03:19] <timmywil> well that's tough. heh
[07:03:21] <DaveMethvin> but i need a platform detection in that case
[07:04:14] <DaveMethvin> and when i looked at it, I thought it was due to IE not setting the value at all in some cases ... but ctrl and meta are definitely not in sync on windows in all cases
[07:04:40] <DaveMethvin> oh i bet they aren't on a click, i only checked keyboard
[07:06:43] <DaveMethvin> ok well to wrap this up, i'm inclined to use the old test, clobber metaKey if it's false and ctrlKey is true, and close docs#3368 patchwelcome
[07:06:46] <bot-t> [#3368] event.metaKey should be assigned to event.ctrlKey on Non-Mac only (closed enhancement: fixed in v1.7) - http://jqbug.com/3368
[07:07:37] <timmywil> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/PRxq8/
[07:07:46] <timmywil> it seems the undefined check works fine for IE7
[07:07:54] <DaveMethvin> brb
[07:08:50] <timmywil> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/PRxq8/1/
[07:10:58] <timmywil> ie6-8 are fine
[07:11:06] <timmywil> ie9 has metaKey as false tho
[07:14:41] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/PRxq8/2/
[07:14:50] <timmywil> if you wanted a platform check
[07:15:15] <timmywil> but i'd leave the undefined check
[07:15:19] <timmywil> maybe something like
[07:15:32] <timmywil> if ( event.metaKey === undefined || platformCheck )
[07:15:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's easy to fix on ie6-8 since they were undefined
[07:15:50] <DaveMethvin> the platform check makes me uneasy
[07:16:01] <timmywil> yea, feels like browser sniff
[07:16:07] <timmywil> but is there any other way?
[07:16:20] <DaveMethvin> i am inclined to set it back to the old way and let people know they can get toe original values in originalEvent
[07:16:26] <DaveMethvin> the
[07:16:35] <timmywil> something inherintly different about keyboard event objects on windows?  and is that better than a platform check?
[07:17:03] <timmywil> actually, I think the new way is better
[07:17:04] <DaveMethvin> old ie doesn't use the formal w3c object model for events/dom in gneral
[07:17:48] <timmywil> the old way made metaKey unreliable on a mac
[07:18:01] <DaveMethvin> if the browsers would just stop lying about metaKey on windows we'd be golden
[07:18:14] <DaveMethvin> OR
[07:18:16] <timmywil> the new way never sets metaKey in ie9, but ctrl key is still correct
[07:18:26] <DaveMethvin> clients could look for the right key
[07:18:45] <DaveMethvin> i am holding down the ctrl key to multiselect, not metakey
[07:18:57] <DaveMethvin> but i think that would cause some havoc
[07:19:07] <timmywil> that's more what I'm getting at yea
[07:19:21] <timmywil> metaKey is really a mac distinction and that works right now
[07:19:30] <DaveMethvin> see, if we do it the RIGHT way then OTHER people will need to change THEIR code
[07:19:46] <DaveMethvin> but if we do it the WRONG way then only WE feel the pain  :D
[07:20:06] <timmywil> not sure which "wrong way" you're talking about :)
[07:20:11] <DaveMethvin> the old way
[07:20:23] <timmywil> but i really think the old way is worse
[07:20:30] <timmywil> for everyone
[07:20:59] <DaveMethvin> except that it makes all existing code work
[07:21:05] <DaveMethvin> but i agree
[07:21:11] <timmywil> how so?
[07:21:18] <DaveMethvin> selectable for one
[07:21:41] <DaveMethvin> it's looking at metaKey,
[07:21:48] <timmywil> any existing code checking metaKey on a mac would break again if relying on it not being the ctrlKey
[07:22:20] <DaveMethvin> true but that has been broken for years so nobody could depend on it
[07:22:35] <timmywil> so it's a tradeoff, but at least this way, users can get at what they want SOMEHOW
[07:22:55] <timmywil> the old way leaves no way to tell the latter
[07:22:58] <DaveMethvin> well they can get to it through originalEvent and there is no shame in that regardless
[07:23:13] <timmywil> ah, well, yes
[07:23:39] <DaveMethvin> at the very least, selectable is expecting metaKey to be set to ctrlKey on windows
[07:24:06] <DaveMethvin> so we need to figure out whether we can support that somehow
[07:24:52] <DaveMethvin> the platform detect concerns me and its big/long/ugly
[07:26:58] <DaveMethvin> that jaubourg guy is a fortune teller: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3368#comment:13
[07:44:57] <Rwhitbeck> DaveMethvin http://twitter.com/bentruyman/status/132462920524242944
[07:44:58] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from bentruyman: Yo @jquery comitters! Can someone tag 1.7 on GitHub? :) ★ http://bit.ly/tZ1COF
[07:45:20] <timmywil> wooops, i thought we did that
[07:45:32] <DaveMethvin> did i not push?
[07:46:07] <timmywil> ah, you pushed the version change, but not the tag
[07:46:38] <timmywil> git tag 1.7; git push --tags upstream master
[07:47:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah just did that
[07:47:23] <DaveMethvin> the build script pushes to origin with tags but i have to push to jquery manually
[07:47:35] <timmywil> yup there they are
[07:47:48] <timmywil> all the beta and rcs showed up too
[07:47:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'd forgotten
[07:48:01] <DaveMethvin> another thing for the checklist
[07:53:32] <timmywil> well woops, how did that not get caught in a test? docs#10670
[07:53:33] <bot-t> [#10670] rnoshimcache probably not constructed correctly (""i"") ""|"") + "")"") - http://jqbug.com/10670
[07:54:02] <DaveMethvin> i think from now on we should just release our beta1 as final so ppl will actually test it
[07:54:21] <timmywil> probably close the other as a dupe of the noshimcache
[07:54:28] <DaveMethvin> i just closed it
[07:54:42] <timmywil> yea i know, just thinking maybe the other way around?
[07:55:05] <timmywil> rnoshimcache is the real issue
[07:55:14] <DaveMethvin> well it'll get fixed either way, and i linked them
[07:55:20] <timmywil> true
[07:56:00] <DaveMethvin> it's nice that some of these ppl are actually looking into the bugs, rather than just posting "myPlugin is busted" tickets
[07:56:09] <DaveMethvin> makes fixing things a lot easier
[07:56:14] <timmywil> yea
[07:56:30] <DaveMethvin> i just wish they'd done it a month ago ... :D
[08:03:23] <DaveMethvin> i am clearly too conservative when i write jQuery, ppl are doing things i wouldn't even think of trying
[08:03:41] <DaveMethvin> "nuclear weapon detonates prematurely when animated with jQuery"
[08:04:08] <DaveMethvin> i never thought about animating percentages, i guess it makes sense tho
[08:06:17] <timmywil> not sure yet how that stopped working
[08:06:24] <timmywil> anyway, reduced http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/hkRaK/4/
[08:08:03] <timmywil> the nodeName is right, I wonder how that ':' is getting in there
[08:11:28] <DaveMethvin> oh i assumed it was from the regexp but let me actually try and follow the code
[08:11:46] <timmywil> you know what happens when we assume
[08:11:57] <DaveMethvin> lol
[08:11:57] <timmywil> ;)
[08:12:11] <timmywil> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/hkRaK/7/
[08:12:37] <DaveMethvin> well the important thing is we know it's borked, it's just a question of  how much and why :D
[08:12:47] <timmywil> yup
[08:21:12] <timmywil> I haven't checked if fixing the regex will fix it, but what's strange to me is that it's not using a cached fragment
[08:23:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm trying to run through the code now
[08:23:42] <DaveMethvin> doesn't hurt to actually understand the code before fixing it :P
[08:26:01] <timmywil> it seems the outerHTML of the cloned node is fine just after cloning, but contains the colon at domManip before appending?
[08:26:15] <timmywil> it hasn't gotten to buildFragment yet
[08:27:19] <timmywil> ah nvm
[08:27:30] <timmywil> it has the colon right at cloning
[08:28:03] <timmywil> but still, before buildFragment
[08:32:21] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: uhohs, http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/hkRaK/10/
[08:34:06] <DaveMethvin> look on the bright side, at least the closing tag is consistent
[08:34:10] <rwaldron> timmywil, i found an element creation path that I missed as well
[08:34:17] <rwaldron> basically, I fucked this up real bad
[08:34:36] <rwaldron> jQuery( "<imanidiot>" )
[08:34:46] <rwaldron> which wrapAll also uses
[08:34:46] <DaveMethvin> that won't work in IE
[08:35:12] <DaveMethvin> well that's what 1.7.1 is for
[08:35:14] <rwaldron> not to mention that shitty regex mistake
[08:35:23] <rwaldron> :(
[08:35:35] <rwaldron> right now I basically feel like a complete fucking joke.
[08:35:36] <DaveMethvin> on the regexp i think it would be smaller to use | as the separator and split on | in the function
[08:36:01] <DaveMethvin> well we had a two month beta and vewy few bugs reported
[08:36:03] <timmywil> i think we need to do this instead of cloneNode: http://www.iecss.com/shimprove/javascript/shimprove.1-0-1.js
[08:36:03] <DaveMethvin> until we release
[08:36:25] <timmywil> innerHTML on a fragment or disconnected element would work
[08:36:34] <rwaldron> timmywil that's exactly what I was trying toavoid
[08:37:06] <DaveMethvin> looks like a lot of code
[08:37:17] <timmywil> nono, just the newCloneNode function
[08:37:34] <rwaldron> we already do that I think
[08:37:44] <DaveMethvin> that;s what we used to do in ie but it was breaky
[08:38:08] <DaveMethvin> lemme find the old stuff
[08:38:13] <timmywil> the codepath does elem.cloneNode currently, which doesn't work right
[08:38:24] <rwaldron> ah, yes... now we do something similar-ish in clean but create the wrapper manually
[08:38:33] <DaveMethvin> oh maybe that trick just for html5 elements?
[08:39:14] <timmywil> that's what I'm thinking, but maybe clean should fix it?
[08:39:24] <timmywil> in which case it could still be the regex
[08:40:29] <timmywil> my mistake, we don't call clean on clone
[08:41:14] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin re: " " vs. "|"... " " gzips better
[08:41:19] <rwaldron> (last time I measured)
[08:41:23] <timmywil> so yea, this seems to be a separate clone problem
[08:42:09] <DaveMethvin> as far as cloning goes, are you suggesting we use the outerHTML trick just for html5 elements?
[08:42:23] <timmywil> yup
[08:42:39] <DaveMethvin> ok well it woudl be better than breakage
[08:42:53] <DaveMethvin> although there are some serious limitations in the string roundtrip
[08:43:03] <DaveMethvin> we used to always use that trick for IE cloning
[08:43:09] <rwaldron> appears that the regex fixes the two tests i just wrote from 10667
[08:43:24] <rwaldron> but the test probably wrong
[08:44:51] <timmywil> i bet attaching it to the shim'd fragment fixes it, but it still seems to be an issue when the clone is disconnected (which is probably how it got through testing)
[08:45:52] <timmywil> rwaldron: http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/hkRaK/11/
[08:46:45] <timmywil> it's interesting that nodeName is fine
[08:47:17] <DaveMethvin> hmm, perhaps an empty xml namespace?
[08:49:20] <rwaldron> i have the rnoshimcache patch
[08:50:17] <timmywil> so maybe for the elements in rnoshimcache, we could do the outerHTML trick on the safeFragment (which is already created) for cloning those elements
[08:50:29] <timmywil> make sense?
[08:50:39] <rwaldron> the clone thing sucks
[08:50:41] <rwaldron> i had clone tests
[08:50:51] <rwaldron> but they were attached
[08:50:53] <rwaldron> :\
[08:51:08] <rwaldron> yeah, that makes sense
[08:51:21] <timmywil> yea, i imagine that's how they passed.  hard to catch this really
[08:52:03] <timmywil> doing anything the clones does work, they're just a little off when not connected
[08:52:05] <timmywil> with*
[09:32:02] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin timmywil I've got a working patch
[09:32:09] <rwaldron> that combines both pieces of the puzzle
[09:32:14] <timmywil> rwaldron: awesome!
[09:32:15] <rwaldron> fixes rnoshimcache
[09:32:31] <timmywil> and disconnected clones?
[09:32:47] <rwaldron> and uses timmywil's suggested outerHTML approach for _only_ archaic IEs and _only_ when it's an "unknown element"
[09:32:51] <rwaldron> yes
[09:32:58] <rwaldron> i have a test specific for that
[09:33:02] <rwaldron> but the test is weird
[09:33:06] <timmywil> nice :)
[09:33:08] <rwaldron> ...BUT...works
[09:33:15] <DaveMethvin> you want to make a pr, or point us to the branch?
[09:33:28] <rwaldron> basically, testing the outerHTML of a cloned, detached node
[09:33:49] <rwaldron> without the special cloneNode path that timmywil suggested, it has colons
[09:33:56] <rwaldron> with the fix, it cmes out right
[09:34:12] <rwaldron> I've run the test suite as such...
[09:34:31] <rwaldron> IE8, Manipulation, then Complete
[09:34:34] <rwaldron> IE7, Manipulation, then Complete
[09:34:36] <rwaldron> IE6, Manipulation, then Complete
[09:34:41] <rwaldron> all passing
[09:34:51] <rwaldron> I have zero confidence right now
[09:35:05] <rwaldron> so I'd really appreciate if someone could verify that for me
[09:35:44] <rwaldron> wait
[09:35:47] <rwaldron> shit
[09:35:55] <rwaldron> the test is useless in Firefox
[09:35:59] <rwaldron> because there is no outerHTML
[09:36:14] <rwaldron> but the problem doesn't exist in Firefox
[09:37:23] <rwaldron> fixed
[09:38:23] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:40:30] <timmywil> haha
[09:40:52] <timmywil> have a lunch meeting.  bbl

[09:45:57] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (8.933s ago): Correct busted rnoshimcache, cloneNode shim. Fixes #10677
[09:46:10] <rwaldron> I need to step away for a min
[09:46:13] <rwaldron> be right back
[10:10:30] <rayj480> hello
[10:10:34] <rayj480> everybody
[10:11:28] <rayj480> I search how to make a horizontal scroll in my website
[10:11:35] <rayj480> do you know a way
[10:11:36] <rayj480> ?
[10:11:48] <rayj480> please, help me
[10:15:31] <rwaldron> rayj480 this channel is for jQuery core development
[10:15:45] <rwaldron> the folks in #jquery will gladly help you with support questions :)
[10:16:55] <rayj480> thanks
[10:26:26] <DaveMethvin> hey rwa
[10:26:30] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[11:00:28] <rwaldron> hey DaveMethvin, sorry, was eating
[11:00:32] <rwaldron> what's crackin'
[11:00:36] <DaveMethvin> you deserve to eat
[11:00:45] <DaveMethvin> i have a meeting in a minute i think
[11:00:48] <DaveMethvin> but anyway
[11:01:05] <DaveMethvin> for the clone case it looked good in general
[11:01:27] <DaveMethvin> it would be good to have some checks to make sure attributes and events are still copied over properly
[11:01:34] <rwaldron> good call
[11:01:43] <DaveMethvin> since all of that goes through a special path for ie6/7/8
[11:02:09] <rwaldron> I'll take some existing clone tests and retrofit them to this scenario
[11:02:15] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[11:02:18] <rwaldron> no problem
[11:03:05] <rwaldron> The placement of the alt path was selected so that as few operations as possible will be subjected to that path
[11:03:24] <rwaldron> anyyyyway
[11:03:29] <rwaldron> i'll write up the tests
[11:28:53] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin
[11:29:03] <ajpiano> please
[12:01:45] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[12:01:56] <DaveMethvin> sorry got another meeting ...
[12:02:03] <rwaldron> no problem
[12:02:15] <rwaldron> tests for attributes, children and events added
[13:29:20] <gnarf> phew... docs#10656 scared me
[13:29:21] <bot-t> [#10656] .removeData( list) does not appear to work (closed bug: wontfix) - http://jqbug.com/10656
[14:07:29] <ajpiano> guys
[14:07:40] <ajpiano> danheberden: has defeated the .it scourge
[14:08:00] <ajpiano> danheberden: i heard gnarf and rwaldron curious about your dark arts
[14:08:19] <rwaldron> i am!
[14:08:22] <rwaldron> LOIC?
[14:08:41] <ajpiano> i can summarise
[14:08:56] <ajpiano> basically dan put up some dummy pages for them to hit when they scraped
[14:09:01] <ajpiano> so then we got the ips
[14:09:06] <ajpiano> and served them crapz0rs
[14:09:30] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: $( 'a' ).map( function() { var href = $(this).attr( 'href' ); $.ajax({ url: /http/.test( href ) ? href.replace('.com', '.it' ) + '?' : 'http://jqueryui.it/' + href + '?', dataType: 'jsonp', type: 'GET' } ); });
[14:09:41] <danheberden> and bust the cache with a query param
[14:10:24] <rwaldron> i love it
[14:27:22] <gnarf> heh
[14:27:27] <gnarf> danheberden: clever
[14:28:43] <gnarf> any chance we can get the domain shut down for trademark infringement or anything stupid like that? :)
[14:31:07] <aaronmcadam> gnarf: I'm very sure there's a case
[14:31:53] <aaronmcadam> does jquery.org cover that
[14:32:04] <ajpiano> we are working on it
[14:32:14] <ajpiano> but it's a lot harder and more complicated than breaking their site
[14:33:35] <aaronmcadam> plus got lots of google indexes to sort out
[14:33:38] <gnarf> yeah
[14:33:45] <gnarf> but danheberden site break ftw
[14:33:46] <gnarf> :)
[14:34:06] <gnarf> now if only you could get it to keep the URL part on the redirection ;)
[14:34:29] <gnarf> anyway, gotta run
[14:34:43] <gnarf> got like 2 days left before this big meeting with Bioware
[14:35:14] <gnarf> trying to polish off some features on our site... - i won't be making it to meetings next week either...
[14:36:57] <gnarf> ya'll know how to find me if you need me ;)
[14:37:22] <gnarf> thanks for the shout-out in the release notes DaveMethvin! *huggs*
