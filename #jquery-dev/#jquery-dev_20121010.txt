[03:46:09] <johnwards> Hey! https://jqueryuk2013.busyconf.com/proposals/new jQuery UK CfP closes on the 11th October
[03:46:15] <johnwards> tomorrow!
[03:46:42] <johnwards> Not had a great number of talks from jQuery team members
[03:48:40] <jzaefferer> johnbender: that's why I submitted mine twice! (oops)
[08:27:18] <johnbender> jzaefferer: ??
[08:30:50] <jzaefferer> johnbender: ??
[08:31:02] <jzaefferer> johnbender: totally highlighted the wrong nickname, sorry
[08:31:21] <jzaefferer> johnwards: that's why I submitted mine twice! (oops)
[08:32:07] <johnwards> However johnbender I see no submission from you ;)
[08:33:04] <johnwards> I want Math and JavaScript ;) (The CfP committee rates however)
[08:37:22] <johnbender> johnwards: In my book that's an exceptionally high compliment you just payed me. Thank you :)
[08:37:52] <johnwards> Go on submit :)
[09:46:38] <johnbender> johnwards: talk submitted, though it looks like I missed the deadline :/
[09:46:40] <johnbender> lol
[09:46:50] * johnbender was not paying attention
[09:46:53] <johnbender> it let it through though
[09:47:41] <johnbender> ah my date is out of whack
[09:47:44] <johnbender> tomorrow is the 11th
[09:49:06] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: vagrant++++
[09:49:24] <ryanneufeld> I'm gushing over it like a schoolgirl over the beebs
[09:49:48] <ryanneufeld> co-workers compy crashed, I'll have her back up and running in no time :)
[09:51:48] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: haha awesome
[09:52:08] <ryanneufeld> I made my own local git repo with configs for each dev
[09:52:13] <ryanneufeld> then they can just clone it
[09:52:20] <ryanneufeld> checkout their branch
[09:52:26] <ryanneufeld> and boom
[09:52:27] <johnbender> :)
[09:52:49] <ryanneufeld> might move to a config.yaml method though
[09:52:56] <ryanneufeld> seems easier to set some configs that way
[09:56:02] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: easier to look at sometimes
[09:56:10] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[09:56:32] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: easier to alter with sed if you want to make some sort of global alteration too
[09:56:39] <ryanneufeld> just have to figure out what's gonna work best for us. Though for now. it's working awesome.
[09:56:43] <ryanneufeld> yeah, There is that
[09:56:46] <johnbender> great to hear
[09:56:54] <johnbender> I love Vagrant success stories
[09:57:07] <ryanneufeld> the only issue so far, is we're using dnsmasq to manage internal DNS
[09:57:14] <ryanneufeld> so DHCP hosts automagically resolve
[09:57:16] <johnbender> even if I only really get like 0.000001% of the credit
[09:57:20] <ryanneufeld> but wildcards don't
[09:57:36] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: you've supported me with it, so that's a big credit
[09:57:56] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: "supported"
[09:58:04] <johnbender> I end up saying "I'm not sure" most of the time lol
[09:58:15] <ryanneufeld> that's okay for me
[09:58:18] <ryanneufeld> it's an honest answer
[09:58:29] <ryanneufeld> I prefer that over "Try X"
[09:58:34] <ryanneufeld> when X is the wrong thing to do
[09:59:52] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I would say the vast majority of the issues that people run into that I really can't help with are networking issues
[09:59:55] <johnbender> like the one you mentioned
[10:00:01] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[10:00:07] <johnbender> I have almost zero networking knowledge
[10:00:16] <ryanneufeld> I have some fairly esoteric needs I think
[10:00:17] <ryanneufeld> LOL
[10:00:25] <ryanneufeld> I can do what I need with bind/dhcp
[10:00:37] <ryanneufeld> I just need time to set it up and configure it.
[10:03:00] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/_fYOqQ
[10:03:00] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix #12690. Avoid use of UTF-8 chars in final files. - Dave Methvin
[10:19:21] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #400: SUCCESS in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/400/
[10:19:21] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Fix #12690. Avoid use of UTF-8 chars in final files.
[12:09:37] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 timmywil: any sizzle fixes that should land in 1.8.3?
[12:43:48] <gibson042> DaveMethvin I haven't had time to work on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12672 , but it probably should be resolved
[12:43:58] <gibson042> as for tickets for which we *have* fixes, https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/157 and https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/161 should land unless timmywil sees a problem with either
[12:43:58] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on sizzle by gibson042 (1w, 4d ago): Fix jQuery #12606: stop cache keys from conflicting with Object.prototype properties
[12:44:51] <DaveMethvin> thanks gibson042, i always figure it's best for the two of you to look at each other's stuff since you actually have some idea of how it works :D
[12:45:10] <DaveMethvin> so i'll bug timmywil
[12:48:23] <timmywil> sorry I haven't had a chance to look at them. I'll be able to go through it all tomorrow.
[12:48:48] <gibson042> timmywil did you have plans for http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12672 ?
[12:49:16] <DaveMethvin> since we're going to be at the summit next week, i wanted to get 1.8.3 out tomorrow if possible
[12:49:32] <DaveMethvin> could push to Friday i suppose it if helps
[12:50:44] <gibson042> I may not get to work on it, but the right fix seems to be replacing a filter operation with a find then filter, pretty much like jQuery.fn.is
[12:51:13] <gibson042> or just moving that intersect into Sizzle
[17:40:37] <spiderworm> am i allowed to ask a support question here? i may have discovered a bug :S but maybe not
[17:49:58] <spiderworm> created a ticket: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12698
[19:49:31] <ryanneufeld> .
