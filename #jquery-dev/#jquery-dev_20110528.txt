[08:56:36] <timmywil> rwaldron: yt?
[09:04:20] <timmywil> so rwaldron: https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/compare/enhancement_9453
[09:04:31] <timmywil> you're a funny one
[12:27:59] <jaubourg> hi there
[12:28:30] <timmywil> hi jaubourg
[12:32:36] <jaubourg> hey timmy :)
[12:33:12] <timmywil> jaubourg: what are you working on?
[12:34:12] <jaubourg> looking into a CSS animation-like method for jQuery... working on a plugin to do that
[12:34:32] <jaubourg> any weird ajax thingy popped up while I was in London?
[12:34:43] <jaubourg> (just checking)
[12:34:45] <timmywil> jaubourg: not that I can think of
[12:34:49] <tbranyen> jaubourg: would be neat if that method could handle transitions from px to auto and vice versa
[12:35:00] <tbranyen> by using max-width/height instead of width/height
[12:35:53] <jaubourg> heh could be a nightmare to deal with but heh, I'll try to have something working first... very very deep into a lot of scenarii... and having the ability to stop an anim doesn't help :P
[12:36:08] <timmywil> max-width/height aren't supported in IE6/7
[12:36:16] <jaubourg> I know ;)
[12:36:34] <timmywil> jaubourg: I'm doing something in jQuery's animate
[12:36:49] <timmywil> for docs#8685
[12:36:51] <bot-t> [#8685] Animations should keep track of animation state in order to properly address stacked animations (assigned enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/8685
[12:37:42] <timmywil> what did you have in mind for animate?
[12:37:51] <jaubourg> hang on
[12:38:10] <jaubourg> http://oksoclap.com/effects-proposal
[12:38:59] <tbranyen> timmywil: he said css animations i assumed that meant the new css3 stuff
[12:39:02] <tbranyen> which doesn't work in ie anyways
[12:39:59] <jaubourg> see at the bottom for an API example
[12:45:20] <jaubourg> does anybody make sense of any of this? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/overlayqueryget#14737000002394730
[12:45:54] <timmywil> no ty
[12:51:15] <tbranyen> jaubourg: i like the blatant sql injection
[12:51:36] <tbranyen> i didn't know people still wrote code like that :-/
[12:51:46] <jaubourg> they do :/
[13:13:36] <timmywil> jaubourg: oldschool https://gist.github.com/997191
[13:23:11] <jaubourg> yes, and stop won't stop the whole animation ;)
[13:23:31] <jaubourg> (sorry to answer that late, was deep into some code)
[14:20:53] <Edler> is this the channel for jquery devs ?
[14:21:18] <jaubourg> dev of core, yes, why?
[14:21:29] <Edler> just asking
[14:21:36] <jaubourg> oki :)
[14:21:38] <Edler> so what's the difference between this channel and #jquery
[14:21:44] <Edler> other types of questions ?
[14:21:53] <Edler> this is for developing and the other if for using ?
[14:21:56] <jaubourg> #jquery is about support in *using* jquery
[14:22:01] <jaubourg> yep :)
[14:22:22] <Edler> ah awesome
[14:22:25] <Edler> question
[14:22:34] <Edler> when you have multiple elements that have the same id on a page
[14:22:42] <Edler> what problem does it cause css and js wise ?
[14:24:09] <jaubourg> #jquery... or even #javascript ;)
[14:24:23] <Edler> kk thx
