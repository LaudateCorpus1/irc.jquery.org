[07:43:06] <DaveMethvin> i'm getting the release ready
[07:43:11] <rwaldron> It was a test
[07:43:21] <rwaldron> no core code changes
[07:43:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah but it regens stuff
[07:43:28] <DaveMethvin> and i need to pull to get it
[07:43:32] <rwaldron> I wouldn't push core code on a release day :P
[07:43:37] <rwaldron> ah, gotcha
[07:43:39] <rwaldron> sorry!
[07:43:52] <rwaldron> Don't forget to "git rm GPL-LICENSE.txt"

[07:44:28] <DaveMethvin> so i won't have to do it all manually
[07:44:42] <rwaldron> sorry about the wrench in your gears

[11:17:02] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i can't bring myself to show this example in the blog entry: http://jsfiddle.net/XEbkZ/
[11:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: HAHA
[11:22:24] <scott_gonzalez> That example is awesome.
[11:22:43] <DaveMethvin> in an "awesome car accident" sort of way
[11:23:56] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: One of the nice things about the new UI release script is that it doesn't touch master, so I don't have to worry about anyone committing during the release process.
[11:24:36] <scott_gonzalez> re: awesome care accident, there are shows, nay, entire CHANNELS dedicated to that sort of thing :-)
[11:25:01] <DaveMethvin> Next up on Fox, "When $(html, props) go bad"

[11:25:56] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure how fancy i want to make the release script ... i think i've got something basic working now but i wont' know until i set debug=false :D
[11:26:26] <DaveMethvin> was just putting the finishing touches on the blog entry
[11:32:01] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: did you add $.attrFn = {} ?
[11:32:08] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: yep
[11:32:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: why not in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/deprecated.js ?
[11:32:32] <DaveMethvin> well that would have been a better place, i agree
[11:32:40] <DaveMethvin> i put it back where it was, not thinking
[11:32:56] <DaveMethvin> but we'll just pull it out soon anyway when we start the 1.9 branch
[11:33:14] <gnarf> yeah, we will pull all of deprecated.js out then too right?
[11:33:24] <gnarf> :)
[11:33:28] <DaveMethvin> yep
[11:33:47] <DaveMethvin> we'll all gonna need new delete keys when we're done
[11:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> Kristin left her iPad on the plane :-/
[11:46:45] <gnarf> doh

[11:48:35] <DaveMethvin> blog draft: http://blog.jquery.com/?p=2102&preview=true&preview_id=2102&public=1&nonce=3dd68fb4a7
[11:49:26] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: I'm thinking I won't mention the license changes in there, it might just cause more confusion if I try to make a short discussion of it
[11:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, that list of people is smaller than I expected.
[11:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> I guess 1.7.2 wasn't that long ago.
[11:55:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, it's limitied to authors, isn't it?
[11:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> Blog post looks good.
[11:56:49] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: right, i've only mention people who gave patches
[11:56:57] <DaveMethvin> the bug tracker results were a mess
[11:57:10] <DaveMethvin> i couldn't make out most of the people in those
[11:57:21] <DaveMethvin> they were nicknames or "anonymous" quite often
[12:02:36] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: why not link to that first draft documentation for effects?
[12:02:49] <DaveMethvin> oh that's a good idea
[12:02:56] <DaveMethvin> do  you have the link handy?
[12:05:03] <DaveMethvin> it was in the 1.8 tickets, not closed yet
[12:05:10] <DaveMethvin> cmon bug tracker
[12:05:11] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Wanna double check this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/6c76983db0aefdcd56e01f6f05e37bf8ca04d8c4
[12:06:24] <DaveMethvin> whew that's a lotta headers
[12:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> yeah...
[12:07:04] <scott_gonzalez> That URL was a lot cooler before I pressed y to normalize it.
[12:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/license
[12:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> Where's socialhapy anyway?
[12:08:43] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hi, thx for the code cleanup :-) What is the jQuery indentation standard? (I was using 2 spaces)
[12:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> tabs
[12:09:02] <agcolom> so one tab
[12:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:09:17] <DaveMethvin> looks good to me scott_gonzalez
[12:09:21] <scott_gonzalez> The XML files in api.jquerymobile.com have mixed spacing right now.
[12:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Ok, I'll push that to master.
[12:09:42] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: https://gist.github.com/54829d408993526fe475
[12:09:42] <agcolom> ok, thank you. I'll get the rest tidy....
[12:10:01] <DaveMethvin> thanks gnarf
[12:10:16] <gnarf> set the description to "Draft documentation for jQuery 1.8 Effects. Please contribute comments." :)
[12:10:18] <agcolom> (I'm on holiday until the 5th Sept but should be able to get that done).
[12:10:43] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: There's no rush.
[12:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I'll get the theming changes made since that affects the XSL which I'm trying to finalize.
[12:11:34] <agcolom> ok, cool Thanks!
[12:12:15] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: otherwise are the iframe examples ok the way I've done them?
[12:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Yeah, I'll see if I can make it easier for you though.
[12:12:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: socialhapy is on break until peol can fix him i guess
[12:13:35] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Also, you may have noticed that some of the demos at the bottom of the page are broken for Mobile. I know the problem and will get that fixed.
[12:13:49] <agcolom> What I find difficult is the fact that I have to go to the start of the line for code examples... then it makes the xml look really ugly!
[12:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It's a problem with the script that generates the iframe for the full demos.
[12:14:05] <agcolom> ok...
[12:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Yeah, that's a bit annoying, but we can't really do anything about that.
[12:16:58] <agcolom> I just have to pretend it's not there ;) ok, should get started in the next few days... I've run away from London for 2.5 weeks and finally found the summer, so I'm happy... and should be able to get that done when it's too hot outside...
[12:18:11] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: if I use dreamweaver, do I need to set the tab size or does it not matter?
[12:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> tab size doesn't matter if you're actually using tabs.
[12:19:36] <agcolom> ok, thank you, have a nice evening...
[12:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> If you're using spaces, it'll control how many spaces it inserts, but if you're using tabs it just changes what it looks like visually for you.
[12:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> you too
[12:21:01] <agcolom> thank you (different projects use different rules for the indentation! That was confusing!)
[12:50:46] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-requestAnimationFrame/blob/master/dist/jquery.requestAnimationFrame.js
[13:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Just published git-notifier to npm.

[14:08:21] <elijahmanor> davemethvin: should git reset for my last PR or wait until the next PR? wasn't sure how that would mess up anything
[14:09:01] <elijahmanor> general question: for issues in the tracker, does jQuery patch older versions or only patch the latest up-coming version?
[14:12:34] <DaveMethvin> elijahmanor: we only patch the latest
[14:12:51] <elijahmanor> okay, good ;)
[14:12:59] <DaveMethvin> it will be a while before we land that since we're just finishing up 1.8
[14:13:10] <DaveMethvin> but you should defn reset your master
[14:14:17] <elijahmanor> yeah, no problem. i actually found 1 of those 8 styles breaks in ie9 with that shorter fix. so i had to do a little more for the other one. i went ahead and made a support attribute too. i'll update that branch and then reset my master so future PRs will be better
[14:14:34] <elijahmanor> i'm looking into that other issue you mentioned... looks like a weird one
[14:16:47] <gnarf> elijahmanor: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-requestAnimationFrame
[14:18:50] <elijahmanor> gnarf: ohh nice... i actually thought jQuery already did this because I saw the comment on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.fx.interval/ "Note:jQuery.fx.interval currently has no effect in browsers that support the requestAnimationFrame property, such as Google Chrome 11. This behavior is subject to change in a future release."
[14:19:11] <kswedberg> oh whoops.
[14:19:12] <elijahmanor> so i looked into the source and saw a plain old setTimeout.
[14:19:25] <kswedberg> rAF was removed at some point.
[14:19:29] <elijahmanor> kswedberg: did the code change?
[14:19:33] <elijahmanor> ahhh i c
[14:19:33] <kswedberg> 1.5ish
[14:19:58] <gnarf> 1.6 introduced, 1.6.2 removed i think
[14:20:23] <elijahmanor> so, i guess that note should be removed, eh?
[14:20:45] <elijahmanor> anyone know why it was removed? gnarf you know?
[14:21:11] <gnarf> elijahmanor: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381?cversion=0&cnum_hist=9
[14:21:29] <elijahmanor> ahhhh, right right right
[14:22:00] <gnarf> 3 months of looking for a solution and eventually john said "rip it out" and it came out
[14:22:04] <gnarf> to my :(
[14:22:05] <elijahmanor> so i guess that is a behavior your plugin has too, right gnarf?
[14:22:29] <gnarf> elijahmanor: of course, don't use setInterval when you could use a callback on animation complete to queue the next
[14:22:33] <gnarf> bad programming
[14:23:04] <elijahmanor> ohh yeah setInterval stinks
[14:23:23] <gnarf> if you use the queue callbacks for "looping" animations you completely avoid this problem - just remember that someones browser might not finish 5000ms later, it might be 5000 seconds if they don't look at it :)
[14:26:37] <elijahmanor> hey this might be a silly question, but will the bug tickets ever go to GitHub issues?
[14:27:35] <gnarf> elijahmanor: doubtful - we do a lot more inside trac than the minimalist github issues supports
[14:28:04] <elijahmanor> gnarf: ahh, i c. just curious ;)
[14:28:27] <gnarf> hopefully I can replace/upgrade the hobbling trac server soon

[14:46:59] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: Care to do the honors? ^^
[14:47:05] <ajpiano> surely
[14:47:21] <DaveMethvin> you are an officer and a gentleman, kind sir
[14:50:46] <DaveMethvin> and with that, the 21-point version release checklist is done.
[14:51:17] <ajpiano> 73 clicks so far
[14:51:17] <ajpiano> lol
[14:51:34] <ajpiano> shit's poppin off
[15:05:46] <gnarf> how do we update the website?
[15:05:52] <gnarf> jquery.com still points at 1.7.2
[15:06:09] <snover> weird synchronised releases
[15:06:13] <snover> i just cut dojo 1.8 final
[15:06:19] <snover> maybe it’s a sign that we should work together
[15:06:48] <snover> HAHAHA JK GUYS nobody listens to me anyway
[15:06:52] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: question for you: Have you guys done any testing on parse time for mobile devices with core?
[15:07:16] <ryanneufeld> grats on 1.8 guys!
[15:07:40] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: i haven't looked at that metric, but would be interested
[15:07:41] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: also ^
[15:07:57] <DaveMethvin> really, it should get better with 2.0 i'd think
[15:07:58] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: cool - I'll file that under todo
[15:08:13] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: feature detection?
[15:08:25] <johnbender> (as to why it would be better with 2.0
[15:08:27] <johnbender> )
[15:08:29] <DaveMethvin> conditional comments
[15:08:33] <johnbender> ah
[15:08:34] <DaveMethvin> you'll get the smaller file
[15:08:47] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: ah
[15:08:55] <DaveMethvin> gnarf:  i still need to do that update
[15:09:07] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I was thinking about all the jQuery.fn.extend and jQuery.extend calls
[15:09:18] <johnbender> regex compilation
[15:09:21] <johnbender> some of those things
[15:09:27] <johnbender> no idea what the perf impact is
[15:09:32] <johnbender> total speculation in my head
[15:09:36] <johnbender> which is why I asked
[15:09:38] <gnarf> johnbender: there are a lot less extends in 1.8 i thin
[15:09:49] <gnarf> a lot of loops were unrolled for gzip compression
[15:09:54] <johnbender> gnarf: nice
[15:09:55] <gnarf> same with extends
[15:10:04] <johnbender> gnarf: good ol fashion assignment eh?
[15:10:16] <gnarf> yup
[15:10:56] <johnbender> gnarf: bangin'
[15:11:21] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: when i did a profiler run it seemed that running the script to create the page widgets based on the initial html structure was the biggest time killer
[15:11:42] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: you mean for mobile?
[15:11:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[15:11:48] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: oh my god
[15:11:55] <johnbender> we have so many performance issues to deal with in mobile
[15:11:59] <johnbender> lol
[15:12:10] <johnbender> I was thinking purely about core sans any mobile
[15:12:15] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: if the html is pre-rendered would it be faster?
[15:12:32] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I meant for websites that use jquery and are served to mobile devices
[15:12:46] <DaveMethvin> for core only, perhaps js parsing would be a big part of it but even then i am not sure
[15:12:47] <ryanneufeld> opposed to generating all the wrappers, could one simply use the generated html instead?
[15:12:48] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: we're descussing that option for future releases of mobile
[15:12:58] <ryanneufeld> how does the current code cope?
[15:13:10] <johnbender> not well
[15:13:13] <johnbender> we don't support it
[15:13:13] <ryanneufeld> does it make a mess of things?
[15:13:13] <DaveMethvin> lol
[15:13:15] <ryanneufeld> haha
[15:13:19] <ryanneufeld> thought as much
[15:13:48] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: alright, I just had the thought as I was working in manipulations.js
[15:14:27] <johnbender> and I wanted to ask to see if someone had already done the work
[15:14:37] <DaveMethvin> just a gut feeling but compressed js doesn't take very long for the browser to parse compared to all the junk we do in javascript
[15:24:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yay btw
[15:24:23] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: its over! :)
[15:24:33] <DaveMethvin> it's NEVER over!
[15:24:35] <DaveMethvin> :P
[15:24:36] <gnarf> Effects fixed a lot more than I remember actually trying to fix ;)
[15:24:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was looking over your docs and thinking, damn gnarf did a shitload of work there
[15:25:27] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: wasn't too terrible, just took like 3 false starts ;)
[15:25:48] <DaveMethvin> well then you're not as good as timmywil, it only took him two!
[15:25:57] <gnarf> heh
[15:25:59] <DaveMethvin> i updated the web repo but forget how to regen it
[15:26:11] <DaveMethvin> that may have changed as well
[15:26:43] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: um - rworth i think was the one that pushed that in the first place
[15:27:34] <gnarf> lemme see if i can get it to work
[15:27:57] <DaveMethvin> i like the concept of having everything in github but making the author pull an entire wordpress/mysql/node/etc setup to their own box isn't ideal
[15:28:32] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com ?
[15:28:53] <DaveMethvin> um
[15:29:00] <gnarf> the download page is there
[15:29:12] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-com
[15:29:17] <DaveMethvin> that's what I edited
[15:29:26] <DaveMethvin> which must be the old stuff?
[15:29:34] <DaveMethvin> IT'S TOO CONFUSING
[15:30:33] <gnarf> it is
[15:30:44] <gnarf> I have no idea where the index is in the jquery.com repo
[15:30:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^^^ ?
[15:31:08] <gnarf> the index file is like totally empty, but obviously works... is that hiding somewhere inside web-base-template or something?
[15:31:31] <DaveMethvin> i gotta go
[15:31:47] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i'll see if i can figure it out :)
[15:33:48] <gnarf> aha
[15:33:51] <gnarf> legacy branch
[15:38:43] * gnarf crosses fingers that I don't mess this up

[18:20:08] <snover> DaveMethvin: can’t we have a love-in to 1.8.1 instead? competition is so competitive
[18:20:18] <snover> i prefer working together
[18:20:38] <DaveMethvin> sounds good to me
[18:21:10] <DaveMethvin> i just want these people to actually TEST what we give them before it's released

[18:27:28] <snover> DaveMethvin: just be glad that jquery core is one relatively tiny set of things
[18:28:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah you have a whole zoo fulla stuff over there
[18:28:51] <snover> we now start the laborious process of evaluating every single module
[18:28:58] <snover> figuring out what needs to go into dojo 2
[18:29:39] <snover> and rewriting them to take advantage of no more oldie
[18:30:03] <DaveMethvin> say it again snover, NO MORE OLDIE
[18:30:18] <DaveMethvin> someone must be cutting onions around here
[18:30:32] <DaveMethvin> the tears
[18:30:38] <DaveMethvin> oh joy
[18:31:32] <snover> :)
[18:32:12] <snover> tbh the way dojo abstracts DOM away from the user there is much less heartache over oldie
[18:32:29] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/2S7QZg
[18:32:29] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Wait for both .stop() tests to finish, don't count on timing. - Dave Methvin
[18:33:10] <snover> I mean we don’t spend a lot of time dealing with oldie bugs
[18:33:25] <snover> usually oldie problems are “THIS IS REALLY SLOW MAKE IT FASTER”
[18:33:29] <snover> and then we go
[18:33:47] <snover> “upgrade your browser and it will be faster, we can’t make jscript 5 go fast”
[18:34:18] <DaveMethvin> well the bug where ie7 clones an element and then the properties are linked ... that's still got me puzzled
[18:34:40] <DaveMethvin> change the clone's id and it changes the parent

[19:56:07] <teka34>  is there any way to delay closing window by using UI dialog like alert()?
[23:25:53] <johnbender> ?tell DaveMethvin I've got some early minification overhead numbers for manipulations.js
