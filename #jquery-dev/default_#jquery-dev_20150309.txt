[02:38:43] <jacquerie> There's something I don't understand about jQuery development. Tabs are used instead of spaces, but the suggested settings for jshint and jscs in http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/ don't enforce this. Am I missing something?

[09:04:41] <tniessen> I'd like to participate in GSoC 2015 and would like to work on the testing infrastructure.
[09:05:27] <tniessen> The proposal suggests using browserstack (amongst other possibilities). I cannot think of a way to use browserstack (which is commercial and requires service authorization) for an open-source system, being available to everybody. We can neither grant everybody access to a single browserstack account nor can we expect developers to pay for an account. Is this consideration correct?

[09:41:20] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: It's because you signed the CAA as Richard Waldron, but your git config has Rick Waldron and we're now checking that names match.
[09:41:51] <scott_gonzalez> This problem popped up with mikesherov as well. I can just updated your CAA signature to use Rick Waldron if you'd like.
[09:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm also open to suggestions for other technical solutions to this problem.
[09:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> The reason we're checking names is because we get a lot of people who sign the CLA properly but then have a git config that uses a nick instead of their name.
[09:42:49] <scott_gonzalez> And we want to get the proper info into git.
[09:43:10] <scott_gonzalez> I've already filed an issue about better error reporting for this case.
[09:58:36] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15jzaefferer closed issue #766: QUnit.only to test only a single test block 02http://git.io/pehG
[10:01:20] <jzaefferer> tniessen: BrowserStack sponsors open-source projects. We have an admin account that we use to give other contributors access to our "company" account. We're already making heavy use of their service through TestSwarm
[10:06:06] <tniessen> jzaefferer: snover said that there is already a solution using intern. Is the project proposal still up to date?
[10:28:58] <jzaefferer> tniessen: we're using Intern on PEP now; we're using Karma for Sizzle and browserstack-runner for QUnit. In the end all of those tools make use for BrowserStack. Figuring out which tool is best for jQuery Core is part of the challenge
[10:29:33] <jzaefferer> tniessen: there might be other tools that aren't getting mentioned either; Intern is certainly an option
[10:31:02] <tniessen> jzaefferer: Sorry, what's PEP?
[10:31:55] <jzaefferer> tniessen: https://github.com/jquery/PEP - the PR to use Intern landed today: https://github.com/jquery/PEP/pull/167

[10:38:03] <tniessen> jzaefferer: Great, thank you. So the project is still up-to-date and work is required to test the jQuery core using browserstack etc?
[10:41:22] <jzaefferer> tniessen: yeah, pretty much. markelog (Oleg) wrote the idea on the wiki page, so he can probably tell you more when he's around
[10:42:08] <tniessen> jzaefferer: okay, thanks!
[10:43:22] <jzaefferer> tniessen: I've contributed to browserstack-runner and integrated it into QUnit, so that's the one I'm currently most familiar with. Whoever worked on Karma in Sizzle can tell you more about that, and snover as the author of Intern is the best person to talk to about Intern...
[10:44:05] <m_gol> to be clear, jQuery Core does use BrowserStack. it's just that the tests are written in PHP and the infrastructure uses TestSwarm
[10:44:44] <m_gol> ideally we'd switch to tests in Node & the test runner to Karma/Browserstack-runner/etc.
[10:46:10] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez yeah, please update to Rick Waldron
[10:46:25] <rwaldron> Thanks
[10:46:43] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: done
[10:46:57] <arthurvr> that was quick :)

[10:50:22] <tniessen> m_gol: There are some server-side test backends which are written in PHP, but the tests are already written in HTML/JS, right? So we basicaly need to exchange backend and test runner?
