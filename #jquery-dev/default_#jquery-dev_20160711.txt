[00:48:30] <somad> hi
[00:48:32] <somad> anyone here?
[02:37:44] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15ShashankaNataraj opened issue #950: Deprecate jQuery.isArray docs changes 02https://git.io/vKZ3U
[11:52:27] <scott_gonzalez> Was this an intentional change? http://jsbin.com/yobuhucife/1/edit?html,js,output
[11:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> The fact that text nodes get filtered out.

[11:57:16] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/0e2f8f9effd2c95647be534bf9055e099aad7cfd
[11:57:47] <gibson042> I think it was intended only for selector-based filters
[11:58:08] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we should switch to using `.filter()`?
[12:00:32] <gibson042> I'm inclined to treat this like a core bug
[12:02:21] <gibson042> because it's inconsistent with $collection.not( singleNode )
[13:01:01] <m_gol> gibson042: makes sense. scott_gonzalez: would you open an issue?
[13:40:10] <markelog> timmywil: mgol: DaveMethvin: gibson042: j_bedard: would like to release eslint-config-jquery 1.0.0 any objections, does anyone would like to add something to it?
[13:40:41] <markelog> timmywil: also, i have send couple of letters, do you have time to give me some time?
