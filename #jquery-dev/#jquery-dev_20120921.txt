[02:18:43] <faraway> i currently write a opensource stylesheet and rules accessing/manipulation library and i'm reusing many code parts of jquery. how should it add the information which and that are parts of the code are from jquery (just a the specific code parts or in the initial comment, so that it is not lost on minification)?
[03:19:23] <paul_irish> i expect google cdn will be all set by noon
[04:33:19] <callumacrae> Why is e.pageX standardised but not e.offsetX? I can think of far more use cases for offsetX than I can for pageX
[04:37:34] <callumacrae> Relevant: #8523

[09:12:17] <i8ramin> Hey everyone. Was wondering what dev's should do with the whole elem.outerWidth({margin: true}) and jQuery 1.8
[09:12:22] <i8ramin> it seems that even the jQuery UI codebase does that
[09:12:28] <i8ramin> and it doesn't work as expected in 1.8 .. returns an object instead of a number
[09:21:09] <ryanneufeld> this place is always so quiet on fridays
[09:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> i8ramin: That's just plain wrong. I don't know who wrote it in jQuery UI, but I removed it.
[09:39:09] <i8ramin> scott_gonzalez, thanks for removing it .. but i think a major change like that should've been communicated to the public a little better
[09:39:13] <i8ramin> it breaks a lot of things
[09:39:24] <i8ramin> older versions of jquery ui, jquery tools, etc
[09:39:38] <i8ramin> for a major company to upgrade both jquery AND jquery ui AND jquery tools ..
[09:39:39] <scott_gonzalez> i8ramin: It was very clearly stated that you cannot use old jQuery UI with new jQuery core.
[09:39:57] <scott_gonzalez> If jQuery Tools is using the API incorrectly, that's something for them to fix.
[09:40:30] <i8ramin> it just feels like the code could've been written in a way to handle the situation
[09:40:31] <i8ramin> thats all
[09:40:37] <i8ramin> oh well, it is what it is now
[09:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> We should definitely not write code to handle invalid input.
[09:40:49] <ajpiano> i8ramin: you mean the function should have been written to handle itself being overwritten
[09:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: The problem is that the call being made is .outerWidth({ margin true }) instead of .outerWidth( true )
[09:41:36] <scott_gonzalez> It's just wrong.
[09:41:42] <ajpiano> cause otherwise, i agree with scott_gonzalez - handling invalid input that could have potentially existed in the past
[09:41:56] <ajpiano> is not something we tend to do
[09:43:00] <scott_gonzalez> Similarly, people shouldn't be relying on type coercion for things like .outerWidth( 1 )
[09:43:03] <i8ramin> ok thanks guys. I'll have to communicate this up the chain and come up with an upgrade plan for BOTH libraries now
[09:43:24] <i8ramin> more work, but better off in the end i guess
[09:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> i8ramin: What version of UI are you using?
[09:43:40] <i8ramin> scott_gonzalez, unfortunately, different versions on different parts of the site
[09:44:06] <i8ramin> anywhere from 1.7.2 to 1.8.2
[09:44:13] <i8ramin> its a mess
[09:44:34] <scott_gonzalez> Well 1.8.x is going to become legacy in a week or two.
[09:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> And 1.7.2 has been legacy for years.
[09:45:22] <i8ramin> well, i just went through hell upgrading our jquery from version 1.4.x to 1.6.2 a few months ago
[09:45:49] <i8ramin> its really hard on large websites
[09:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> You must be doing some strange things.
[09:46:29] <i8ramin> I'm thinking of just doing a search/replace of ({margin:true}) for now
[09:46:32] <scott_gonzalez> Upgrading should be pretty painless.
[09:46:59] <i8ramin> scott_gonzalez, have you ever upgraded major JS versions on a site with 2+ billion page views a month? :)
[09:47:11] <ryanneufeld> from 1.6.2 and up it should be pretty easy
[09:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know how page views relates to difficulty upgrading.
[09:47:31] <i8ramin> yeah, from 1.4.x to 1.6 was not .. the whole attr() prop() change was interesting
[09:47:51] <i8ramin> it just means that its a huge site with many moving parts, many developers, many sub projects, etc
[09:47:55] <scott_gonzalez> attr() -> prop() should've been less than a day regardless of the size of your app.
[09:47:56] <ryanneufeld> i8ramin: we went from 1.6.2 to 1.7.2 with no code changes
[09:48:11] <i8ramin> ryanneufeld, we were hoping to do the same with 1.6 -> 1.8
[09:48:16] <i8ramin> until this outerWidth issue
[09:48:28] <i8ramin> we may just go to 1.7.2 for now
[09:48:37] <ryanneufeld> it is stable
[09:48:38] <i8ramin> we have a code freeze before the holidays
[09:49:02] <scott_gonzalez> i8ramin: If searching for calls to .outerWidth/Height is too much work, then something must be wrong with the dev process.
[09:49:23] <i8ramin> its not just searching and replacing. you gotta make sure it works as expected
[09:49:27] <i8ramin> there's QA process involved
[09:49:31] <i8ramin> different browers, etc
[09:49:42] <i8ramin> you can't just assume it works cause the release notes say it does
[09:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> i8ramin: I'm aware of what goes into testing a change.
[09:50:13] <scott_gonzalez> i8ramin: If you're honestly going to do full QA on every change from `{ margin: true }` to `true` then you must have little faith on software.
[09:50:29] <i8ramin> for example, nowhere on the jquery website does it say that your overlays (jquery tools) won't work after this upgrade. we found out after testing. so we gotta test all the 3rd party plugins as well
[09:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> This is one of the most trivial changes ever.
[09:50:42] <scott_gonzalez> Why would we say that?
[09:50:54] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: jQuery Mobile 1.2.0 Release Candidate 2 has arrived - http://t.co/vI16Drx5 ★ http://bit.ly/PHpufE
[09:50:54] <scott_gonzalez> We're not associated with jQuery Tools in any way.
[09:51:06] <i8ramin> scott_gonzalez, if I'm just replacing that string yes .. i agree. but if we're upgrading the entire jquery UI and jquery Tools libraries
[09:51:08] <i8ramin> then we gotta test
[09:51:38] <ryanneufeld> i8ramin: you'd have to do this anyway right?
[09:52:07] <i8ramin> ryanneufeld, if we're only upgrading jquery 1.6 -> 1.8 .. then there is less risk and less to test
[09:52:27] <scott_gonzalez> I highly doubt that's true.
[09:52:50] <i8ramin> cause i was involved in making sure that we only have a single version of jquery on our site (it used to be 4 different versions)
[09:53:01] <ryanneufeld> That's a good thing
[09:53:08] <i8ramin> but we still have different versions of jquery UI served on different parts of the site (sub projects, etc.)
[09:53:12] <i8ramin> so thats a more risky upgrade
[09:53:16] <ryanneufeld> okay
[09:53:23] <ryanneufeld> what are you expecting from the jQuery team?
[09:53:32] <i8ramin> I'm just stating real use cases here .. not saying you guys did anything wrong
[09:53:53] <i8ramin> nothing. i came here to get some information about the change
[09:53:55] <i8ramin> and I got it
[09:53:57] <i8ramin> so thank you.
[09:55:13] <ryanneufeld> You're welcome
[09:55:16] <i8ramin> but scott_gonzalez , you mentioned that somebody decided to pass in {margin:true} into outerWidth/Height .. and somebody decided to do the same exact thing in the jquery tools project (and possibly other 3rd party plugins)
[09:55:20] <i8ramin> just wondering how that all started
[09:55:29] <i8ramin> since it is clearly wrong
[09:55:47] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea.
[09:56:14] <i8ramin> ok guys. off to tell my manager that we're gonna need more time for this upgrade. wish me luck!
[09:56:29] <i8ramin> and keep up the strong work. looking forward to 1.9 and 2.0 ..
[09:56:41] <ajpiano> good luck and godspeed i8ramin :)
[09:57:08] <ryanneufeld> Good luck i8ramin
[09:58:53] <ryanneufeld> got my flights booked for DC
[10:01:24] <ryanneufeld> looking forward to it
[12:03:15] <sizcommit> [sizzle] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Y3LYHw
[12:03:15] <sizcommit> [sizzle/master] No more backcompat for new arguments; minor size reduction - Timmy Willison
[12:04:26] <timmywil> that also pushed the 1.8.2 tag for sizzle
[12:07:02] <ryanneufeld> who do you guys use for a domain registrar?
[12:07:14] <kswedberg> ryanneufeld: names.com
[12:07:23] <kswedberg> *name.com
[12:07:44] <ryanneufeld> cool
[12:08:14] <kswedberg> they're reasonably priced and not sleazy like godaddy
[13:34:50] <paul_irish> 1.8.2 is on the CDN
[13:36:01] <paul_irish> ryanneufeld: namecheap also good.
[13:36:12] <paul_irish> 1and1 takes too long to propogate
[13:39:28] <zz_zz_zz_zz_sind> gandi.net is pretty good
[13:50:34] <arielserafini> what about google's own domain service?
[14:14:16] <ryanneufeld> paul_irish: thanks, I'll check them out
[14:14:45] <ryanneufeld> zz_zz_zz_zz_zz_s: I use gandi right now, but I don't think it's easy enough for the average person, so I was exploring others
