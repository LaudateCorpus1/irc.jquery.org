[06:46:43] <m_gol> markelog: I guess it's fine if it makes life easier, I just thought we forbid it.
[06:47:05] <m_gol> and since it's not documented I couldn't know it was discussed. ;) It happens.
[06:49:16] <markelog> m_gol: you know, github allows you to change the message when squashing, so we can just do that instead, would be less convenient, but wouldn't require to change the docs 
[06:50:45] <m_gol> markelog: maybe; I don't have a strong opinion about that. I prefer to land from SourceTree locally anyway. ;)
[06:51:12] <markelog> it is so cool to do it from the phone :)
[06:52:10] <markelog> at eslint we decided to do the same thing, simplifies things a lot
