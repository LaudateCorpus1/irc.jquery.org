[14:31:26] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: when are you planning to do the 3.0 rc? I can get a Migrate 3.0rc out on Monday
[14:31:40] <DaveMethvin> we prob need the 1.x/2.x more urgently anyway
[14:32:01] <DaveMethvin> mainly i want to make sure nothing lands in core that breaks the migrate rc :)
[14:50:05] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: there's this focusin Firefox breakage that we might want to fix before 2.2.4
[14:50:31] <m_gol> We don't have to have it ready for 3.0.0-rc1 IMO, though
[14:51:08] <m_gol> The fix should be trivial but I'd love to understand what's going on & write a test
[14:52:06] <m_gol> markelog_ wanted to look into that
[14:52:51] <markelog_> yeah, probably on the weekend though
[14:53:05] <m_gol> Sure
[15:20:23] <timmywil> m_gol, DaveMethvin, markelog_ If we can get migrate released and the firefox bug fixed before Monday, we can release all 3 then.
[15:20:40] <timmywil> that doable?
[15:20:47] <markelog_> sgtm
[15:21:15] <timmywil> cool
[16:59:20] <DaveMethvin> yep worksforme
