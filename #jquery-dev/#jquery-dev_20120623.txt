[13:36:27] <gnarf> can people check to see if they can ssh to jquery.com ?
[13:36:47] <gnarf> Before I call up danheberden on a sat. I wanna make sure there isn't someone else around here that can add my key
[13:37:17] <gnarf> ajpiano: maybe you?
[13:37:37] <ajpiano> gnarf: i def don't have jquery.com
[13:37:53] <ajpiano> or the wherewithal to add keys
[13:37:57] <gnarf> cool - I'll call dan
[13:38:06] <gnarf> I can give you the echo command to add the key ;)
[13:42:06] <ajpiano> no i mean an acct with privs
[13:46:18] <gnarf> ajpiano: if you have jqadmin - you can add a key to jqadmin :)
[13:46:57] <ajpiano> gnarf: i also don't have my ssh keys setup on this comp :|
[14:09:33] <gnarf> ajpiano: do you use passphrased key?
[14:10:00] <gnarf> ajpiano: if so - i suggest dropboxing your id_rsa
[14:10:12] <ajpiano> gnarf: i have the keys i just have to move them over
[14:10:22] <gnarf> ajpiano: if not- i suggest converting them to passphrased anyway
[14:10:29] <ajpiano> heh, yeah, probably wise
[14:11:36] <gnarf> osx deals with passphrased keys REALLY well
[14:11:42] <gnarf> linux isn't terrible
[14:11:50] <gnarf> eval `ssh-agent` ; ssh-add
[14:12:02] <gnarf> but OSX pops up a nice little password box and remembers until you logout
[14:14:53] <gnarf> i really need to make my own dotfiles repo
[14:14:59] <gnarf> including my alias for that ^^^

[16:53:32] <Krinkle> hm.. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-compat-1.9/ is a 404 error (linked from the 1.8b1 blog post)
[16:57:06] <gnarf> it is?
[16:57:08] <gnarf> not for me
[16:57:12] <Krinkle> private?
[16:58:01] <gnarf> work now?
[16:58:09] <Krinkle> yup
[16:58:10] <gnarf> I assume dave wanted that repo public if he linked to it
[16:58:15] <gnarf> so i made it public
[16:58:32] <gnarf> thanks for pointing it out Krinkle :)
[16:58:39] <Krinkle> you're welcome
