[10:46:47] <mikesherov> happy new year
[11:03:02] <timmywil> .
[11:03:07] <timmywil> danheberden: yt?
[11:03:16] <timmywil> or gnarf, http://jewquery.com
[11:03:24] <timmywil> can we set the x-frame-options header?
[11:04:54] <ralphholzmann> wait, wasn't jewquery a splash page for the jewish contributors to the jquery project?
[11:05:30] <danheberden> timmywil ya
[11:08:50] <gibson042> .
[11:09:14] <timmywil> ralphholzmann: i'm not sure
[11:14:27] <danzik17> hey timmywil - just curious, how would removing the boolHook fix http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11115 ?  i didn't think it hit that codepath
[11:15:06] <timmywil> we override sizzle attribute retrieval with attr
[11:15:33] <danzik17> doh, that explains that.  tks.
[11:15:53] <timmywil> np :)
[11:15:55] <danheberden> timmywil can you verify jewquery for me
[11:16:35] <timmywil> danheberden: that got it
[11:16:37] <timmywil> thanks!
[11:17:17] <danheberden> thanks for pointing it out
[11:17:29] <timmywil> although clicking that page is kinda fun ;)
[13:18:29] <gibson042> .
[13:47:29] <RobertPlummer> Hey guys, I recently worked on a visible event that works quite well and wondering if it can be added to jQuery core.
[13:48:04] <RobertPlummer> It works very well and seems to be something many of us would like to use.
[13:48:07] <RobertPlummer> //a sudo "onvisible" event
[13:48:09] <RobertPlummer> $.fn.visible = function(fn, isOne) {
[13:48:11] <RobertPlummer> 	if (fn) {
[13:48:13] <RobertPlummer> 		$(this).each(function() {
[13:48:15] <RobertPlummer> 			var me = $(this);
[13:48:17] <RobertPlummer> 			if (isOne) {
[13:48:18] <ajpiano> RobertPlummer: hi
[13:48:19] <RobertPlummer> 				me.one('visible', fn);
[13:48:21] <RobertPlummer> 			} else {
[13:48:23] <RobertPlummer> 				me.bind('visible', fn);
[13:48:25] <RobertPlummer> 			}
[13:48:25] <ajpiano> please don't paste large blobs of code into irc channels
[13:48:27] <RobertPlummer> 			
[13:48:29] <RobertPlummer> 			function visibilityHelper() {
[13:48:31] <RobertPlummer> 				if (!me.is(':visible')) {
[13:48:33] <RobertPlummer> 					setTimeout(visibilityHelper, 500);
[13:48:33] <ajpiano> oh goodness
[13:48:35] <RobertPlummer> 				} else {
[13:48:37] <RobertPlummer> 					me.trigger('visible');
[13:48:39] <RobertPlummer> 				}
[13:48:41] <RobertPlummer> 			}
[13:48:43] <RobertPlummer> 			
[13:48:45] <RobertPlummer> 			visibilityHelper();
[13:48:47] <RobertPlummer> 		});
[13:48:49] <RobertPlummer> 	} else {
[13:48:51] <RobertPlummer> 		$(this).trigger('visible');
[13:48:53] <RobertPlummer> 	}
[13:49:35] <RobertPlummer> lol
[13:49:37] <RobertPlummer> sorry
[13:49:37] <ajpiano> RobertPlummer: the best way to make a feature request is to file a ticket on the bug tracker
[13:49:51] <ajpiano> and then perhaps file a pull request
[13:50:04] <ajpiano> however, i can't see the addition of such an event to jQuery core itself
[13:50:12] <ajpiano> seems like a plugin to me :)
[13:53:03] <ajpiano> sorry to be the bearer of bad news
[13:55:50] <RobertPlummer> yea, but it is sooo useful!
[13:56:04] <RobertPlummer> a visible event, doesnt' IE have something like that.
[13:56:44] <ajpiano> RobertPlummer: so are a lot of jquery plugins
[13:56:56] <ajpiano> like, 2 million people find the cycle plugin useful - it's still not in core :)
[13:57:14] <RobertPlummer> oh well, just thought I'd ask.
[13:58:02] <ajpiano> we have a feature proposal period to prepare for what we're gonna do for each major release
[13:58:20] <gnarf> i second ajpiano's opinion there
[13:58:20] <bot-t> (4 hours 31 mins ago) <ben_alman> tell gnarf thanks!
[13:58:23] <ajpiano> but i'm pretty sure that most of the core team would react similarly to the proposal of such an event
[13:58:37] <gnarf> its plugin land
[13:58:47] <ben_alman> less in core MORE PLUGINS
[13:59:17] <gnarf> we would only include something like that in core if it helped us write core smaller
[13:59:18] <gnarf> really
[13:59:26] <RobertPlummer> ah ok
[13:59:26] <gnarf> otherwise, it just makes more sense as a plugin
[13:59:38] <ben_alman> RobertPlummer: make your plugin, promote it on the net, and then people will ask that it be included in core
[13:59:41] <ben_alman> not the other way around
[13:59:51] <RobertPlummer> oh ok
[14:00:08] <ben_alman> (i mean, they *might* if they all like it enough)
[14:00:45] <RobertPlummer> In a way though tons of issue can be fixed if we could ensure that it was possible to get the size of a dom object.
[14:01:11] <RobertPlummer> That is 1 of my biggest problems when working with some types of ajax.
[14:01:26] <ben_alman> what does ajax have to do with dom objects?
[14:01:34] * ben_alman missed the setup
[14:01:53] <RobertPlummer> My current use case with with codemirror, and how each of the modes load individually.
[16:17:03] <mikesherov> .
[16:17:51] <mikesherov> anyone around?
[16:19:22] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you around?
[16:20:51] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[16:20:54] <DaveMethvin> sup?
[16:21:47] <mikesherov> Hey, so I was reading all of the minutes from the last meeting... I was off yesterday so I couldn't make it. Didn't see any discussion of plans for a 1.7.2 release
[16:22:11] <mikesherov> I was wondering if we were planning on doing one, and if the list of tickets currently targetted to it in Trac is accurate
[16:22:20] <DaveMethvin> no specific plans, mainly waiting for a good excuse to put one out
[16:22:24] <DaveMethvin> but i think there will be one
[16:22:48] <DaveMethvin> if it's a bug fix i think it's worth targeting to 1.7.2
[16:23:47] <DaveMethvin> i still don't know when we might do 1.8 but it wouldn't surprise me that we didn't do 1.8 until may or june
[16:23:50] <mikesherov> K, and the other thing I had was I told you I'd be around on tuesday to merge the include_js.php changes... so here I am in case you were planning on doing any merging today
[16:24:13] <DaveMethvin> i need to look at the pull q and also the tix targeted to 1.7.2
[16:24:22] <DaveMethvin> i may get the chance to do that later tonight
[16:24:25] <mikesherov> yeah, I read that part about having a long release window
[16:24:47] <DaveMethvin> i had so many grand plans for the holiday, dunno where the time went :D
[16:25:06] <DaveMethvin> somehow i'm 5 pounds heavier too
[16:25:21] <mikesherov> ha, I only got a chance to submit one PR
[16:25:26] <mikesherov> I was sick for the most of the rest of it
[16:25:33] <DaveMethvin> oh sorry to hear that
[16:25:47] <mikesherov> Meh, it was a good excuse to sit around and rot
[16:26:20] <mikesherov> and in general, I'm not sure how to specifically move forward on some of the tickets where I'm wondering about what our mobile support is
[16:26:34] <DaveMethvin> and the mobile guys would know that best
[16:26:50] <DaveMethvin> i would love to land that patch that saved us like 400 bytes
[16:26:58] <DaveMethvin> altho that might be safer to land in 1.8
[16:27:08] <mikesherov> also, I got some info regarding mobile safari and support for getClientRect() for the simplifying offset code
[16:27:33] <mikesherov> oh, for sure
[16:27:51] <DaveMethvin> i think we'll need a 1.8 branch so we can start to land that stuff
[16:28:13] <mikesherov> Hmm, that's a good diea
[16:28:14] <mikesherov> idea*
[16:28:28] <mikesherov> especially all the support test changes
[16:28:40] <DaveMethvin> yep
[16:28:40] <mikesherov> there are like 6 that are archaic now with our browser support
[16:28:51] <DaveMethvin> and the build system will prolly change a bunch
[16:29:00] <mikesherov> It already is :-)
[16:29:13] <mikesherov> and I think we need to have an official support document for mobile browsers
[16:29:20] <mikesherov> I can test on iPhone, I just need to know which versions
[16:29:36] <DaveMethvin> whatever Mobile supports, we  have to support obviously
[16:29:56] <mikesherov> because even the simplify offset change... I can get rid of the silly webkkit fallback if I know that we're only supporting iOS3+
[16:30:28] <DaveMethvin> i am not much of an expert on that, did the original 2007 iphone ship with safari2?
[16:30:48] <mikesherov> Well, I asked on stackoverflow
[16:30:50] <mikesherov> ...
[16:31:01] <mikesherov> I had to give up 50 rep to get an answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8627968/what-version-of-mobile-safari-comes-with-each-version-of-ios/8718970#8718970
[16:31:30] <mikesherov> do we support the original iPhone!?
[16:31:59] <DaveMethvin> i dunno, whatever Mobile does ...
[16:32:08] <mikesherov> k
[16:32:26] <DaveMethvin> http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/
[16:32:28] <mikesherov> A grade support: Apple iOS 3.2-5.0 - Tested on the original iPad (4.3 / 5.0), iPad 2 (4.3), original iPhone (3.1), iPhone 3 (3.2), 3GS (4.3), and 4 (4.3 / 5.0)
[16:33:24] <DaveMethvin> which is prolly before feb 2009 :(
[16:34:42] <mikesherov> In that case, I don't think we can support the offset drop
[16:34:57] <mikesherov> because even the webkit fallback didn't come until a later safari :-\
[16:35:12] <DaveMethvin> damn
[16:35:14] <mikesherov> but honestly, it's like <1% of users
[16:35:26] <mikesherov> it's a ridiculous level of support
[16:35:30] <DaveMethvin> which may still mean we can drop it
[16:35:34] <mikesherov> yeah
[16:35:40] <DaveMethvin> i mean, it's more a question of how badly it breaks
[16:35:46] <mikesherov> I just need to convince them though, you're saying
[16:35:50] <mikesherov> It break completely!
[16:35:55] <DaveMethvin> i dunno if mobile itself depends on offset
[16:35:58] <mikesherov> offset will return 0,0 always then
[16:36:13] <mikesherov> Oh, I see
[16:36:19] <DaveMethvin> well who knows that may be the right answer for their uses :P
[16:36:34] <mikesherov> is there anyone specific on the mobile team to talk to about this?
[16:36:57] <mikesherov> Because honestly, it's like 500 bytes we're savings, and a bunch of dumb support tests
[16:37:16] <DaveMethvin> the other possiblilty would be to push it off to them
[16:37:22] <mikesherov> I see
[16:37:25] <DaveMethvin> if it's only mobile, make them pay the price
[16:37:37] <DaveMethvin> scott jehl is prolly the best person to ask
[16:37:50] <mikesherov> so, if I wanted to do that, I just go to #jquerymobile-dev and tell them that
[16:38:00] <DaveMethvin> b/c that is such a massive amount of bytes
[16:38:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[16:38:50] <mikesherov> is scott on twitter?
[16:38:54] <mikesherov> ^^ dumb question
[16:39:04] <mikesherov> what's the best way to contact him
[16:39:19] <DaveMethvin> i have his email, just a sec
[16:41:27] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: it's scott at filamentgroup.com
[16:42:28] <mikesherov> thanks!
[16:44:50] <mikesherov> discussing in jquerymodile-dev right now
[18:45:34] <rwaldron> .
[18:45:39] <rwaldron> mke
[18:45:41] <rwaldron> ack
[18:45:59] <rwaldron> ?tell mikesherov I think scott is travelling the world these days
[18:45:59] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
[19:55:56] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin you blitzed me
[19:56:03] <rwaldron> i was mid-closing that ticket
[19:56:16] <DaveMethvin> gotta be faster rwaldron :D
[19:56:17] <rwaldron> it's a duplicate
[19:56:27] <rwaldron> he's being a whiner
[19:56:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah it is but i was just asking why he thought the current doocs didn't explain it well enough
[19:56:43] <DaveMethvin> he's asking for something that's already there
[19:56:53] <DaveMethvin> but i want him to actually read the page
[19:56:58] <DaveMethvin> :)
[19:57:01] <rwaldron> you're absolutely right
[19:57:12] <rwaldron> and I had additional comments
[19:57:21] <rwaldron> but i still think it's a close as wontfix
[19:57:28] <rwaldron> duplicate, rather
[19:57:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah it will be a dup for sure
[19:57:49] <rwaldron> "An easier course would be to simply not use strings will are known DOM Node properties or element attributes . No one files a bug against JavaScript for not allowing the arbitrary use of break, do, instanceof, typeof, case, else, new, var, catch, finally, return, void, continue, for, switch, while, debugger, function, this, with, default, if, throw, delete, in or try - that would be absurd right? Because you can j
[19:58:05] <rwaldron> ack, there is a weird typo in there
[19:58:10] <rwaldron> you saved me from the typo!
[19:58:18] <DaveMethvin> you're welcome!
[19:58:20] <DaveMethvin> haha
[19:58:39] <DaveMethvin> it's always risky to fire "custom" events that have common verbs for names
[19:59:05] <rwaldron> I'm not sure why people ever think to do that
[19:59:43] <DaveMethvin> because it's easier to type "init" than "whatever:init" or "initPlugin"
[19:59:52] <rwaldron> remember when we were chatting in boston about tickets that report things that we don't understand because we simply would never do whatever is being reported?
[19:59:56] <rwaldron> this is one of those
[20:00:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[20:00:13] <rwaldron> what's more, he refuses to let it go
[20:00:23] <DaveMethvin> and there are performance implications if this guy is using trigger when he should use triggerHandler
[20:00:23] <rwaldron> refuses to learn something from your _VERY_ sound advice
[20:00:28] <DaveMethvin> bubbling ain't free
[20:01:10] <rwaldron> for real
[20:44:01] <gibson042> .
[20:51:26] <danheberden> ?tell mikesherov yo, can you pm me when you got a minute?
[20:51:27] <bot-t> danheberden, Okay.
