[01:23:52] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol opened issue #1950: Don't assume the browser environment in src/, run a smoke-test on Node 02http://git.io/8yjlfQ
[06:31:39] <DaveMethvin> timmywil or m_gol  you've both done releases in the past right? I tried doing a test release last night and my vm is just not healthy
[06:31:44] <DaveMethvin> i keep getting lock file issues
[06:31:49] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: k, I can do it
[06:32:51] <DaveMethvin> you asked about 1.11.3 m_gol, if we don't do that one we get out of sync on the patch versions
[06:32:56] <DaveMethvin> dunno if people will be confused by that
[06:34:06] <m_gol> idk, patch versions are by definition non-breaking
[06:34:13] <m_gol> and our contract is about API compatibility
[06:34:21] <m_gol> so all patch releases are equivalent
[06:34:39] <DaveMethvin> except the ones that we break :)
[06:34:50] <m_gol> people should just assume 2.1 & 1.11 share the API, patch releases are irrelevant here
[06:34:52] <m_gol> true ;)
[06:35:01] <m_gol> I mean, the release process is a huge hassle
[06:35:03] <DaveMethvin> since we do have a working 1.11.2 i am inclined to agree with ou
[06:35:16] <m_gol> if breaking one of the releases makes us re-release both, we have a problem ;)
[06:35:22] <DaveMethvin> at least this way we only have one build run to do
[06:35:26] <m_gol> right
[06:35:29] <DaveMethvin> i think everything is cleaned up and ready to go
[06:35:36] <DaveMethvin> the authors are good
[06:35:48] <DaveMethvin> the only issue you will see is that the zip files aren't built correctly
[06:35:57] <DaveMethvin> but i can recreate them from the files pushed to the CDN
[06:36:09] <DaveMethvin> i have an issue open to fix that
[06:37:02] <DaveMethvin> oh also the "gathering contributors" step is borked, I blew away the report it was using by accident
[06:37:12] <DaveMethvin> well it was more like by *stupidity*
[06:37:15] <m_gol> k, give me 5 minutes to finish corrections to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1949 and I'll get to the release
[06:37:23] <m_gol> haha
[06:37:41] <DaveMethvin> anyway i created a new one but didn't commit a change to the release.js script to change the report number
[06:38:05] <DaveMethvin> after the first 3.0 release it won't matter since we won't have tickets to grab from Trac
[06:38:17] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks
[06:39:38] <m_gol> I haven't run the release for a while so I'll start with the dry run
[06:39:55] <DaveMethvin> good idea :)
[06:42:20] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: so we should change the milestone on GitHub to 2.1.3/1.11.2
[06:42:29] <DaveMethvin> yes
[06:42:38] <DaveMethvin> there are a few places, the milestone and the blog
[06:42:46] <DaveMethvin> and the titles of the tickets
[06:42:54] <DaveMethvin> i have them memorized by now :)
[06:43:02] <m_gol> haha
[06:43:17] <m_gol> and the download page ;)
[06:43:49] <m_gol> error; re-trying
[06:44:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i never updated the download page or sent the cdns so less to do
[06:44:31] <m_gol> I think I didn't have all the tags on my fork, heh :)
[06:45:03] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin closed issue #1788: 2.1.2-pre, ajax.js: environments that don't have 'location' variable will break 02http://git.io/h0C_pw
[06:47:05] <m_gol> something wrong again :/
[06:47:09] <m_gol> during changelog generation
[06:47:33] <m_gol> ok, I still don't have all the tags
[06:48:10] <m_gol> hopefully I'll have everything I need before the 10th try :)
[06:48:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think i ran it about 58 times during the past couple of days :)
[06:51:39] <DaveMethvin> brb
[06:57:30] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: my zips are empty as well
[06:57:51] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: the important part is to rename file references in the map file...
[06:58:19] <m_gol> btw, I have the "Release complete" message and it doesn't react to pressing enter etc.
[07:00:11] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: exactly, the files are the same except for the internal references
[07:00:16] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, it's hung?
[07:00:24] <m_gol> it seems so
[07:00:41] <m_gol> Creating production archive for googlecdn
[07:00:41] <m_gol> Creating production archive for mscdn
[07:00:41] <m_gol> Release complete.
[07:00:41] <m_gol> Please review the project-specific release checklist.
[07:00:42] <m_gol> the end
[07:01:00] <m_gol> seems that it should just finish at this point?
[07:01:03] <DaveMethvin> hmm did it push all the tags to your repo etc?
[07:01:08] <m_gol> it did
[07:01:51] <DaveMethvin> i suspect it's related to the zip file creation https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1940
[07:02:31] <DaveMethvin> the other release.js bug only applied to 1.11-stable so that one isn't a problem
[07:02:50] <DaveMethvin> if it pushed all the tags then i say go for it
[07:03:19] <m_gol> https://github.com/mzgol/jquery/commit/43f3a006b0d57bbb8c1d447d765aa778c052b53f
[07:03:37] <DaveMethvin> oh pretty!
[07:03:47] <m_gol> the most important part: https://github.com/mzgol/jquery/blob/43f3a006b0d57bbb8c1d447d765aa778c052b53f/dist/jquery.js#L7575
[07:03:48] <m_gol> :P
[07:05:52] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: if that looks good I'll procede to the real thing
[07:06:05] <m_gol> success at 3rd try, not bad :P
[07:06:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah i am jealous!
[07:06:20] <DaveMethvin> go for it
[07:06:32] <DaveMethvin> if something goes wrong there's always 2.1.4 :)
[07:07:06] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: "2.1.4" THANKS :P
[07:07:37] <DaveMethvin> good luck we're all counting on you!

[07:14:15] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: the last look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/8f2a9d9272d6 before I publish to npm? ;)
[07:15:52] <DaveMethvin> lgtm m_gol 
[07:15:54] <m_gol> looks good IMO but a second pair of eyes won't hurt :)
[07:15:56] <m_gol> ok!

[07:18:45] <m_gol> DONE
[07:18:52] <DaveMethvin> HOORAY!
[07:19:25] <DaveMethvin> yep, published to npm
[07:19:50] <m_gol> phew; nothing blew up ;)
[07:20:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i must have been lucky to get two releases out before my VM started acting up
[07:20:33] <DaveMethvin> i have a feeling it might be b/c i have the VM on an external flash
[07:20:52] <m_gol> that might be causing problems ;)
[07:20:54] <DaveMethvin> but if that's the case the image is probably corrupted so i have to rebuild...AGAIN!
[07:20:58] <m_gol> frequent writes etc.
[07:21:10] <m_gol> didn't you snapshot? ;)
[07:21:25] <DaveMethvin> i should have!
[07:21:55] <DaveMethvin> usually what happens when i do that is i end up capturing some stupid problem and when i roll back i keep forgetting to fix it
[07:22:20] <m_gol> haha
[07:22:33] <m_gol> btw, we should mention why we "omitted" 2.1.2
[07:22:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah i added a thing in the writeup
[07:22:47] <m_gol> and thank denis-sokolov for vigilance ;)
[07:22:51] <DaveMethvin> did that too!
[07:23:00] <m_gol> :)
[07:23:07] <m_gol> it's 1.11.2, not .3
[07:23:40] <DaveMethvin> just the title, right?
[07:23:45] <DaveMethvin> i think i got the others
[07:24:17] <m_gol> it seems so
[07:24:28] <m_gol> at least Google Docs' search says so :)
[07:24:48] <DaveMethvin> right, i forgot about the title
[07:24:50] <DaveMethvin> fixed now
[07:25:24] <DaveMethvin> btw if you have any additions you want to make to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Release-process feel free
[07:25:42] <m_gol> the link to the milestone in the doc seems wrong but just the link and I assume you copy it as plain-text to Wordpress
[07:26:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah, if you copy/paste the href it works
[07:26:44] <DaveMethvin> and i'll check once it's in the blog
[07:26:53] <DaveMethvin> the chars in your name always break too!
[07:26:59] <DaveMethvin> i have to use &xxx
[07:30:45] <DaveMethvin> blog preview http://blog.jquery.com/?p=3605&preview=true&preview_id=3605&public=1&nonce=191de2b7c5
[07:30:55] <DaveMethvin> ok i'm over to update jquery.com download page
[07:32:44] <m_gol> link to the WebKit bug is broken
[07:32:48] <m_gol> it points to http://blog.jquery.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps:/bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=135549%E2%80%9D
[07:32:57] <m_gol> same with the trac link
[07:33:14] <m_gol> smart quotes, haha
[07:33:27] <DaveMethvin> gotta love em
[07:34:09] <DaveMethvin> fixed
[07:36:16] <m_gol> don't we want to link to https versions of the files?
[07:36:58] <DaveMethvin> we didn't have that until recently ... so it wasn't a conscious choice
[07:37:02] <DaveMethvin> for our CDN that is
[07:37:03] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: we have the site in both https & http mode now so internal links should start with //
[07:37:27] <DaveMethvin> you mean for image references and the like?
[07:37:43] <m_gol> e.g. the link to the download page
[07:38:02] <m_gol> I think that's the only one
[07:38:05] <m_gol> in this post
[07:38:23] <DaveMethvin> hmmm ... yeah i guess that's true
[07:38:35] <DaveMethvin> just thinking about whether there are any holes in our coverage
[07:39:01] <DaveMethvin> I'll do that in a separate commit
[07:39:08] <m_gol> /download/ is available via https anyway :)
[07:39:09] <b-ot> m_gol: memorised ‚Äúdownload/‚Äù.
[07:39:16] <DaveMethvin> THANKS bot
[07:39:21] <m_gol> b-ot: ?forget download/
[07:39:26] <m_gol> what was the command...
[07:39:32] <m_gol> ?forget download/
[07:39:33] <b-ot> m_gol: I have forgotten ‚Äúdownload/‚Äù. My mind is going, I can feel it.
[07:39:39] <DaveMethvin> geez
[07:39:47] <m_gol> magic quotes, magic IRC commands... ;)
[07:41:06] <m_gol> oh, the green... :) http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[07:41:08] <DaveMethvin> ok i updated the download link in the blog
[07:41:27] <DaveMethvin> linkS
[07:42:16] <m_gol> the link now say it's http but it links to https :)
[07:42:18] <m_gol> the download one
[07:42:35] <m_gol> how about <a href="//jquery.com/download/">jquery.com/download/</a>?
[07:42:49] <DaveMethvin> well i figured we should encourage https
[07:42:54] <DaveMethvin> if we support it all over now
[07:43:13] <m_gol> k, then the link name should say https as well :)
[07:43:22] <m_gol> looks good now
[07:44:31] <m_gol> it took us half a week to get this release out the door! :)

[07:45:43] <DaveMethvin> oh true
[07:45:49] <DaveMethvin> i have to publish that first
[07:46:03] <m_gol> :)
[07:46:08] <DaveMethvin> there's a bit of a dance here b/c people immediately read the blog and go to the download, etc
[07:46:19] <m_gol> haha
[07:46:32] <DaveMethvin> so something is off for a while no matter what
[07:46:41] <m_gol> there are also links down the page
[07:46:44] <m_gol> to the CDN
[07:46:55] <m_gol> ah, they're ok
[07:47:08] <DaveMethvin> some of those are samples of usage and not always updated
[07:47:33] <m_gol> imagine how many places will need to change when we switch from 1.x/2.x to jQuery Compat/jQuery nomenclature ;)
[07:47:55] <DaveMethvin> don't remind me
[07:48:10] <m_gol> I've already noticed one; we link to in-progress versions of 1.x/2.x instead of compat etc.
[07:48:21] <m_gol> I'll submit a PR
