[05:04:38] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: ^
[05:04:42] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/140
[05:17:42] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: ah, no, that's not me
[05:17:50] <jzaefferer> no idea where that came from
[05:18:07] <Krinkle> it's the qunit cookbook example. Which failed since it didn't include testswarm inject
[05:21:15] <jzaefferer> testusr1, created 20130319085518. Not a JS timestamp though
[05:22:28] <jzaefferer> no idea
[05:22:50] <jzaefferer> a security hole somewhere? w
[05:22:55] <Krinkle> What do you mean by "Not a JS timestamp"
[05:23:06] <jzaefferer> would go away once we land the projects update?
[05:23:17] <Krinkle> Yes
[05:23:24] <jzaefferer> new Date(20130319085518) => Fri Nov 27 2607 20:18:05 GMT+0100 (CET)
[05:23:54] <Krinkle> Why would it be a js timestamp? Where do you see that timestamp? Is it a js timestamp for other accounts?
[05:24:33] <Krinkle> Pass as string instead of numer.
[05:24:41] <Krinkle> It only takes unix epoch as number
[05:24:54] <Krinkle> new Date('20130319085518')  -> Invalid Date
[05:25:09] <Krinkle> The Date constructor doesn't take many formats anyway.
[05:25:29] <jzaefferer> its in the mysql table for TestSwarm
[05:25:32] <jzaefferer> whatever the format
[05:25:39] <Krinkle> It's a 14 digit timestamp.

[08:31:31] <jzaefferer> yep
[08:31:37] <jzaefferer> back in the day on the Thinkpad
[08:55:41] <JamesMGreene> DaveMethvin Nice response to jashkenas
[08:56:30] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene thats some sneaky ju-jitsu right thare
[08:56:44] <DaveMethvin> "you want a fix? No problem, make one!"
[08:56:47] <JamesMGreene> That's why you're the president, my friend
[08:57:08] <DaveMethvin> hey i am? in that case lets invade canada
[08:57:24] <JamesMGreene> Making browsers older than the spec support the spec's method... sheesh....
[08:58:25] <DaveMethvin> using the old activex control makes me nervous, but i don't mind his users being the beta testers for that
[08:58:38] <DaveMethvin> if it works, who knows we might pull it in
[09:11:45] <JamesMGreene> Yeah
[09:11:54] <JamesMGreene> It would be cool to pull in if he does the work :)
[09:17:46] <JamesMGreene> So why do we use a CAA? I know there are a few differences, just curious which ones we wanted
[09:18:28] <JamesMGreene> Assuming so that jQuery Foundation is the sole copyright holder of all team members' work and therefore can sue for infringment...? Also possibly to relicense (aww, jQuery 2.0 Professional Edition!)
[09:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: Not for relicensing.
[09:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> MIT already allows relicening, and if it didn't, jQuery Foundation couldn't do it just because it's the majority copyright holder.
[09:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> There's still plenty of code that's owned by individuals.
[09:20:47] <JamesMGreene> Because of the CLA, right?
[09:20:52] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:20:55] <JamesMGreene> gotcha
[09:21:31] <scott_gonzalez> Putting the majority copyright under a single owner just simplifies things.
[09:35:36] <JamesMGreene> oh boy
[09:35:51] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez Your email is already getting shocked reactions
[09:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> Notice that all the shocked reactions are from the mobile team :-(
[09:36:32] <JamesMGreene> Totally agree with JasonDScott, though, we should be automating this
[09:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> We're working on it.
[09:36:53] <JamesMGreene> Add a grunt task to check it against the CLA list (and CAA list, too, apparently?)
[09:37:11] <JamesMGreene> It's definitely tricky when people use all these different frickin' emails, though
[09:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> The emails aren't the tricky part.
[09:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> Either they signed correctly, or they didn't.
[09:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> The tricky part is keeping the CLA list private while publicly automating.
[09:42:46] <JasonDScott> scott_gonzalez why is this something that we need to keep private (besides the emails)?
[09:43:01] <scott_gonzalez> It has addresses, phone numbers, etc.
[09:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> The emails are public.
[09:43:23] <scott_gonzalez> They're in the git data and in AUTHORS.txt.
[09:44:45] <JasonDScott> true. Can we keep just a of names / github id's public that we can check against? 
[09:45:13] <JasonDScott> s/just a/just a list
[09:45:39] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, or just add a simple web front to it so that it just takes the name and email to check and returns a list of match-y names and emails
[09:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> If we could do that, it would be done.
[09:46:07] <scott_gonzalez> Google makes this near impossible.
[09:46:09] <JamesMGreene> No auth required for that, right
[09:46:13] <JamesMGreene> oic
[09:46:23] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why it hasn't happened yet.
[09:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> We're looking into CLAHub.
[09:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> But we don't want to use it the way it was designed.
[09:46:41] <scott_gonzalez> They've already made some changes.
[09:48:28] <JamesMGreene> https://github.com/mikeymckay/google-spreadsheet-javascript ?
[09:49:48] <JamesMGreene> (but, you know, internally used so that we aren't exposing the spreadsheet)
[09:55:01] <JamesMGreene> I must be missing something as this seems pretty straight-forward (minus the whole needs-to-be-privately accessed thing): e.g.GET https://spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/list/key/worksheetId/private/full?sq=age>25%20and%20height<175
[09:55:19] <JamesMGreene> (+ OAuth)
[09:55:50] <JamesMGreene> (and an `?alt=json` unless you want to parse XML)
[09:57:04] <JamesMGreene> Also:
[09:57:07] <JamesMGreene> https://npmjs.org/package/spreadsheet
[09:57:09] <JamesMGreene> https://npmjs.org/package/gdata
[09:57:12] <JamesMGreene> https://npmjs.org/package/gdata-js
[09:58:19] <JamesMGreene> https://npmjs.org/package/google-spreadsheets
[09:58:46] <JamesMGreene> https://npmjs.org/package/google-spreadsheet
[09:58:50] <JamesMGreene> Fuckin' A, NPM....
[09:58:55] <JamesMGreene> Too many near dups
[10:02:39] <JamesMGreene> https://npmjs.org/package/google-spreadsheet looks somewhat promising, though
[10:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: Feel free to put something together.
[10:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> When I looked at it months ago, I couldn't find any way to do it.
[10:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> And all the documentation I could find basically enforced that you must be logged into a browser.
[10:04:43] <JamesMGreene> I've got some other things I need to work on first but if no one else tackles it, I'd be happy to
[10:04:59] <scott_gonzalez> I was able to do it with public documents without a problem.
[10:05:04] <JamesMGreene> I have experience working with the GData APIs in Node a bit already from https://npmjs.org/package/gcph-client
[10:05:33] <JamesMGreene> Though I just used the Google ClientLogin API for that instead of OAuth but it looks like there is a module for that anyway
[10:10:46] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez We could use the Google ClientLogin API until April 20, 2015 :-P
[10:11:08] <JamesMGreene> That works w/o a browser for sure
[10:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> What is that?
[10:15:31] <JamesMGreene> It's their old auth API
[10:15:35] <JamesMGreene> predates OAuth
[10:15:48] <JamesMGreene> It's what I used for https://npmjs.org/package/gcph-client
[10:16:07] <JamesMGreene> but it is being killed on April 20, 2015
[10:16:24] <JamesMGreene> Could be a good short term solution, though
[11:11:03] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Do you want to file a bug about the WSH problem since you have access to the environment?
[11:44:42] <rwaldron> gibson042 the output for compare-size is lovely
[11:45:40] <gibson042> awesome :)
[11:46:19] <rwaldron> gibson042 go ahead and merge it
[11:46:24] <rwaldron> also, what is your npm user name?
[11:46:37] <gibson042> gibson042
[11:46:47] <gibson042> I created it after your attempt to grant privileges
[11:46:58] <rwaldron> got it
[11:47:38] <rwaldron> gibson042 you're in
[11:47:43] <gibson042> sweet
[11:47:49] <rwaldron> go ahead and merge that, then do the release
[11:47:56] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^^
[11:48:13] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin would like you to test drive new compare-size
[11:48:17] <rwaldron> kthx bai!
[11:48:24] * rwaldron doesn't actually leave
[11:48:48] <gibson042> rwaldron this should be RC, right? I can't think of anything else we need to add
[11:48:56] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron gibson042 no way i'm gonna call your baby ugly ... go for it
[11:49:08] <rwaldron> gibson042 I can think of one...
[11:49:16] <rwaldron> we need to update the version of grunt
[11:49:21] <rwaldron> 0.4.1 or better
[11:49:38] <gibson042> np, I'll do that between the merge and publish
[11:49:39] <DaveMethvin> it said grunt 0.4.1 or better so i used `make`
[11:49:44] <gibson042> lol
[11:49:55] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ouch
[11:50:03] <DaveMethvin> i'll be here all day
[11:50:07] <DaveMethvin> actually, not
[11:50:09] <gibson042> I think it's ~0.4.0 now, but we'll lock it to 0.4.1
[11:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron gibson042: You might want to add peerDependencies.
[11:50:34] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez your mom's a peerDependencies
[11:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:50:49] <rwaldron> <3
[11:51:05] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Don't make me bring my mom to Brooklyn...
[11:51:10] <gibson042> I don't even understand peerDependencies
[11:51:17] <rwaldron> She's welcome to sto by!
[11:51:24] <rwaldron> gibson042 you and me both
[11:51:39] <rwaldron> I mean, I think I get it
[11:51:47] <rwaldron> but I've never used it
[11:51:50] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: It's a way for you to say, if you're installing grunt side-by-side with grunt-compare-size (which everyone will), then you can say I require 0.4.x
[11:52:07] <gibson042> isn't that just called a dependency?
[11:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:52:15] <rwaldron> ....which confirms what I thought I knew
[11:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> Imagine this case:
[11:52:23] <rwaldron> but I still haven't used it
[11:52:42] <scott_gonzalez> dependencies: { "grunt": "0.3.x", "grunt-compare-size": "0.4.x" }
[11:53:12] <scott_gonzalez> That would install grunt 0.3.17 and and then install grunt 0.4.0/1 under grunt-compare-size
[11:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> But grunt-compare-size would fail if it actually requires 0.4.x to work.
[11:54:33] <rwaldron> you just connected a dot for me
[11:54:36] <rwaldron> thank you
[11:54:40] <scott_gonzalez> You're welcome.
[11:54:40] <gibson042> me too
[11:54:43] <gibson042> thanks scott_gonzalez
[11:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:55:58] <scott_gonzalez> So generally what you want is: grunt to be a peerDependency and a devDependency.
[11:56:25] <gibson042> yep
[12:01:42] <JamesMGreeneAway> btw scott_gonzalez, apparently you can make a custom OAuth workflow WITHOUT launching a browser (called "2-legged") but it sounds like a pain in the ass
[12:02:00] <scott_gonzalez> oh yeah?
[12:02:05] <JamesMGreeneAway> See http://stackoverflow.com/a/14251144/471696 and https://developers.google.com/drive/delegation
[12:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub should just implement CLA signing.
[12:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ryan Dahl was bitching about this like 4 years ago
[12:10:06] <JamesMGreene> That would make it much easier
[12:10:25] <gf3> Isn't there that PR plugin thing for CLAs
[12:10:27] <gf3> ?
[12:10:35] <JamesMGreene> It's a shame a PR can't just count as an implicit CLA signature
[12:10:50] <gf3> http://www.clahub.com/
[12:11:24] <JamesMGreene> Yeah but it's not good enough for our needs yet
[12:11:38] <JamesMGreene> gf3: see https://github.com/clahub/clahub/issues/27
[12:11:40] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: Issue #27 by jasonm (1mon 2w ago): Make CLAHub compatible with other Commit Status tools
[12:12:54] <gf3> Mmmm
[12:20:23] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: Ooo, disappearing views
[12:22:35] <eddiemonge> should the code state a function is deprecated and what version it was deprecated in?
[12:22:45] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez All we really need GitHub to do is allow PRs to show multiple statuses by allow the providers to differentiate them
[12:22:58] <JamesMGreene> e.g. Travis status type = "CI", CLAHub status type = "CLA", etc.
[12:23:12] <scott_gonzalez> eddiemonge: Code shouldn't, docs should
[12:38:19] <eddiemonge> would i be wasting my time if i went through jquery and standardized var l = something.length; var len = something.length?
[12:39:03] <gnarf> eddiemonge: yes, but if you're editing something nearby, "l" shouldn't be used, it should probably be "length" anyway
[12:39:10] <gnarf> minifiers munge, we can use real words
[12:39:31] <gnarf> but doing a blanket commit of that change is pointless
[12:39:41] <gnarf> at least, IMO
[12:40:30] <gnarf> JamesMGreene: hrm.... you know, having the "type" flag and only showing the last of each "type" on the PR seems sane...
[12:41:06] <gnarf> i will get right on the 9ball status type...
[12:41:10] <gnarf> 8ball

[13:13:29] <gibson042> I thought we were shooting for semver
[13:13:45] <gibson042> x.y.z-extra+build
[13:14:41] <timmywil> I'm all for semver, but didn't we want to keep it the same as jquery?
[13:15:05] <gibson042> shoot, is jquery still 1.9.2pre?
[13:15:14] <timmywil> tis

[13:15:44] <DaveMethvin> ohai i saw your email gibson042
[13:15:51] <gibson042> I guess we'll stick with it then; maybe this can wait too
[13:15:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah we should decide to change
[13:15:59] <DaveMethvin> but pick a good time
[13:16:12] <DaveMethvin> i did the 2.0 betas in old style
[13:16:20] <DaveMethvin> but i do think semver is good
[13:17:11] <DaveMethvin> if we say we're semver now do people expect us to not break stuff on .x upgrades? because i'm an AMERICAN and that is my right!
[13:18:01] <gibson042> I've been making the 1.10 proposals with that in mind, figuring it's never too late to jump in front of a parade
[13:21:16] <timmywil> It's hard to imagine a lot of hub-bub over pre -> -pre
[13:22:34] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: inevitably things will get broken in .x upgrades. I EMBRACE it.

[16:02:44] <gseguin> JamesMGreene: I have no idea how to fix the PhantomJS issue on Jenkins, sorry
[16:18:27] <JamesMGreene> So, who can tell me about how to setup donation accounts for open source projects? wycats__?
[16:19:24] <JamesMGreene> We're on the fence for PhantomJS
[16:21:08] <JamesMGreene> We'd prefer indirect donations (e.g. domain name renewal, CI server infrastructure rental, etc.) versus direct financial contributions ($) but I'm pretty sure the latter will be necessary -- at least to maintain the CI server infrastructure costs (unless the donating entity is a server host themselves)
[16:21:23] <JamesMGreene> rworth?
[16:22:20] <JamesMGreene> gseguin gnarf? How is jQuery's server infrastructure funded? By $$ or indirect contribution of the server resources?
[16:23:37] <JamesMGreene> DaveMethvin?
[16:25:20] <JamesMGreene> Bueller?
[16:27:30] <gseguin> JamesMGreene: I think it is one of (mt) Media Temple's contribution to the jQuery Project but I could be wrong
[16:28:45] <JamesMGreene> So it is an indirect contribution of a resource then, versus $$
[16:29:30] <gseguin> JamesMGreene: correct
[16:30:06] <gnarf> yeah
[16:30:14] <JamesMGreene> Did they come to you or vice versa?
[16:30:41] <gnarf> before my time
[16:30:42] <gseguin> no idea, that's before my time and out of my scope
[16:30:45] <gnarf> maybe rworth would know
[16:30:51] <gnarf> ask rworth about these things
[16:31:10] <gnarf> possibly Rwhitbeck too
[16:31:58] <Rwhitbeck> MT donates it to the project
[16:32:27] <JamesMGreene> Rwhitbeck do you recall if MT reached out to jQuery, or vice versa?
[16:33:00] <gnarf> JamesMGreene: you should talk to rworth :)
[16:33:01] <Rwhitbeck> I don't remember … I think they offered it after we went looking for cheaper alternatives to Amazon
[16:33:12] <JamesMGreene> The trouble with PhantomJS is that we 3-4 CI servers (Windows, Mac, Linux 32-bit, Linux 64-bit)
[16:33:27] <JamesMGreene> Unfortunately I haven't seen any single service offer all of those
[16:33:35] <JamesMGreene> And their environments can vary a lot :-\
[16:33:38] <gnarf> vagrant + vms?
[16:34:40] <JamesMGreene> Do they offer a service to host them too?
[16:36:08] <JamesMGreene> gnarf ^
[16:37:13] <gnarf> no
[16:37:14] <gnarf> but
[16:37:20] <gnarf> you can run them in a host
[16:37:21] <danheberden> BUTT
[16:37:27] <gnarf> specially if you have a full host
[16:37:30] <gnarf> like not a vm itself
[16:37:35] <gnarf> also
[16:37:56] <gnarf> (mt) has this new thing which is pretty awesome using OpenStack
[16:39:36] <gnarf> you could build your CI server for each env, and just spawn it up with a job
[16:39:42] <gnarf> using open stack
[16:41:49] <JamesMGreene> Can Vagrant VMs be run on any host OS?
[16:42:06] <gnarf> JamesMGreene: yeah, its virtualbox
[16:42:16] <gnarf> in the backend
[16:42:30] <gseguin> It's using VirtualBox I believe
[16:42:32] <JamesMGreene> So a MacOSX or Windows VM could be run on a Linux server?
[16:42:39] <gnarf> easily
[16:42:39] <JamesMGreene> yeah, their site said VirtualBox, too
[16:42:55] <gnarf> you can run it headless too
[16:44:07] <JamesMGreene> My main concern at this point is I'd like a consistent setup (i.e. all VirtualBox images) and a single host (i.e. Amazon/OpenStack/whatever)
[16:44:25] <JamesMGreene> (for all 3-4 OS images)
[16:45:38] <JamesMGreene> and, of course, with a good price-to-quality ratio on the host service since the price will be recurring if not donated
[17:31:40] <JamesMGreene> rworth: Are all of jQuery's tech donations from (MT)?
[17:32:17] <JamesMGreene> (mt)
[17:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: First comment on http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12137737/Coding%20standards is "no Hungarian notation"
[17:48:46] <scott_gonzalez> $div is type hinting where $ = jQuery object.
[17:49:10] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Feel free to delete all the style guide comments in that PR.
[17:49:52] <timmywil> ah, I could see that. didn't think of it as hungarian.
[17:50:25] <scott_gonzalez> If you dig through the mailing list archive from years ago, I'm sure you'll find some heated debates about this :-)
[17:50:42] <timmywil> i bet
[17:55:59] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez timmywil feel free to have those conversations in here and not all over PR ;)
[17:56:12] <rwaldron> (i'm just busting your chops)
[17:56:41] <timmywil> i think I commented four times in a row :P
[17:57:04] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[17:59:52] <rwaldron> I want to close this http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13240
[18:00:10] <rwaldron> with "closing: underscore policy"
[18:00:58] <rwaldron> "underscore policy" => sacrificing cross browser consistency to avoid admitting you made a mistake
[18:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: I like "Also, your caps lock is broken."
[18:15:52] <rwaldron> :D
[18:16:14] <rwaldron> originally I wrote "Where can I file a bug for your caps lock key?"
[18:17:23] <snover> can someone tell me how we ever managed to successfully write apps that interacted with servers with only two http verbs?
[18:17:28] <snover> i just can’t even believe it
[18:18:22] <JamesMGreene> It's easy, POST can do anything and everything :-P
[18:18:37] <JamesMGreene> It's just not idempotent like GET
[18:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: It's cute that you think GET is actually idempotent on the web.
[18:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> GET is just POST with a data limit :-P
[18:20:13] <JamesMGreene> lol
[18:20:41] <JamesMGreene> Well, GET is _supposed_ to be idempotent but it's up to the backend implementation, of course
[18:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, ideally it is. I'm just saying that lots of people violate that.
[18:23:02] <JamesMGreene> yup yup, true that
[18:23:25] <snover> <a href="this?delete=1">delete record</a>
[18:23:52] <snover> idempotent
[18:33:34] <JamesMGreene> lol
