[12:11:38] <m_gol> timmywil: our build script doesn't like variables with names starting with "return" :-)
[12:22:57] <m_gol> timmywil: ping
[12:23:20] <timmywil> heh, that exists?
[12:28:00] <m_gol> timmywil: I was just wondering if not to make one for returnTrue/returnFalse
[12:28:15] <m_gol> but is seems smaller if they're just functions in a module so I reverted that change
[12:29:28] <timmywil> well, if we encounter the problem again, it's an easy fix. It's a matter of adding \b to the regex, I think.
[12:32:14] <m_gol> good idea, I was changing "return" to "return "
[12:33:17] <m_gol> how do we provide two components in the commit message
[12:33:29] <m_gol> I have a commit that affects both Event & Manipulation
[12:34:23] <timmywil> good question
[12:34:35] <timmywil> maybe Event: Manipulation: ?
[12:35:36] <m_gol> that sounds like a hack :-)
[12:35:42] <m_gol> not sure if changelog generation works with it
[12:35:49] <m_gol> I tried a comma but no dice
[12:36:02] <m_gol> ok, I divided it into two commits. Some changes might be harder to divide, though
[12:37:18] <timmywil> I think we've done that before though
[12:37:40] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol opened pull request #2366: Remove internal args to on & remove methods (06master...06remove-internal-args) 02http://git.io/vkM0j
[12:49:35] <Mr21> Hi :) somebody can explain me what it's the use of the four arguments after the percent here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects/Tween.js#L35
[12:51:01] <Mr21> they are here from the first commit but they are never used
[12:55:20] <m_gol> Mr21: the idea is that you can define your own easing function and it gets all these arguments, no built-in easing uses them, though. jQuery.easing has never been documented, gnarf is doing the first (big) step to changing it by adding tests for jQuery.Tween in PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2326/ where you can see tests for these parameters. gnarf would know more about it than me, though.
[13:00:43] <Mr21> m_gol: I know already we can add some easing I read the part in the code of jqueryui where you add many new easing, but even jqueryui dont use them :S do you have an example?
[13:03:38] <m_gol> Mr21: I don't. As I said, gnarf will surely know more. :)
[13:04:13] <gnarf> Mr21-- The only reason you'd ever want them is a super super edge case
[13:04:14] <Mr21> I understand, thanks
[13:04:19] <gnarf> Mr21: they are legacy
[13:04:26] <gnarf> they were defined in original jQuery effects
[13:04:41] <m_gol> gnarf: so maybe we could remove them in 3.0?
[13:06:32] <Mr21> gnarf: yeah, it's the really first commit, but if you see closely.. they are never used (even at the first commit), you see the 0, 1? in the first commit there was an formule who use them but... 0 + percent * 1 it's useful i think
[13:06:39] <Mr21> *it's not
[13:07:02] <gnarf> m_gol: probably
[13:11:06] <Mr21> I also asked to http://gsgd.co.uk/sandbox/jquery/easing/ why he design his plugin like this (he use only the other arguments but not the first)
[13:12:12] <Mr21> But he answer something like jquery made an update by adding directly the percent. But.. not in the history of the commit.. im lost
