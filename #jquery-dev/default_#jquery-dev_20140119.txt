[07:54:29] <gnarf> DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez : I really think we should bump the versions on wp-content's jquery core and migrate to the betas / rc's when they come out - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/277#issuecomment-32711193
[07:54:59] <DaveMethvin> sounds like a jquery-release task! :)
[07:56:00] <DaveMethvin> i'm good with that, perhaps we could also mention that we're using them site-wide and ask people to be on the lookout for problems they see, since we won't have the time to look everywhere for problems
[07:57:03] <DaveMethvin> is there code we are using that needs Migrate still? I'd be interested in seeing what warnings we get and see if we can get rid of it by patching or updating code
[07:57:17] <scott_gonzalez> We should not be using migrate.
[07:57:22] <scott_gonzalez> That needs to stop ASAP.
[07:57:36] <scott_gonzalez> But nobody has been willing to spend time on it.
[07:57:48] <DaveMethvin> oh so we may not really need it?
[07:59:00] <scott_gonzalez> We do, but I don't know why yet.
[07:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> I just remember doing an update, having stuff break, being annoyed, and throwing migrate at the problem.
[07:59:24] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/b9fd072cfe2a51a4a463d85657741328cc258ea6
[07:59:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still not happy with the mess we got from 47m.
[08:00:05] <DaveMethvin> do you know a page that breaks? I can look at it
[08:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember.
[08:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> This was during the big new-css updates.
[08:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> On Monday, I'm going to go through every site and try to figure out what breaks without it.
[08:02:30] <DaveMethvin> if we knew a page i could manually enable Migrate messages on the .min and look
[08:02:44] <DaveMethvin> but we could also just load the uncompressed instead
[08:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> I seem to recall it being a problem with a 3rd party plugin.
[08:03:18] <DaveMethvin> no doubt
[08:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't really remember the details.
[08:03:23] <DaveMethvin> probably something like .attr
[08:03:32] <DaveMethvin> so even if the plugin hasn't been updated we could patch it
[08:04:04] <scott_gonzalez> Well, patching plugins just breaks our upgrade path.
[08:04:04] <DaveMethvin> so if you're updating, just pull the unminified copy and at least we'll see the messages
[08:04:19] <DaveMethvin> we can push the patches upstream
[08:09:36] <gnarf> i think we should run it anyway
[08:09:47] <gnarf> unmined for messages
[08:09:58] <gnarf> but *shrug*
[08:10:40] <gnarf> we should also not need it
[08:10:41] <gnarf> :)
[08:11:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's pretty bad for us to run it.
[08:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> People will look at our site as a reference.
[08:11:19] <scott_gonzalez> And it's currently pretty bad.
[08:11:28] <scott_gonzalez> And having migrate is one of the bad things.
[08:11:55] <gnarf> sure
[08:12:02] <gnarf> can we at least bump to the 1.11 rc ?
[08:12:05] <gnarf> or should we?
[08:12:32] <scott_gonzalez> See my comment.
[08:12:44] <scott_gonzalez> If you want the testing to be community testing on production, then we can bump it.
[08:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise, we should leave it.
[08:14:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think that it's okay - cc ajpiano 
[08:14:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i mean, if a bug comes up, someone will report it
[08:15:14] <gnarf> we might want a better "report an issue with this page" link somewhere
[08:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> We've been trying to add that for over a year.

[08:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/218
[13:44:44] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: about patching plugins - if the plugin is dead, we can fork it and patch it to work with new core versions; if it's still maintained, nothing prevents us from sending patches upstream so that they'll integrated
[13:45:26] <m_gol> I agree it looks bad for us to use Migrate on our sites, it's like saying that we made all these awesome changes but they're unusable since even we have to patch it to simulate older behavior
[13:46:26] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: anyway, if you looked at the pages and marked clearly what breaks, that would be awesome. It's much easier to be fixing particular plugins than to try to do all of it at the same time
