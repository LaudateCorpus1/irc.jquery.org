[11:34:41] <leobalter> jzaefferer meeting
[11:35:07] <leobalter> Gibson, Krinkle and James are offline, I'm pinging JÃ¶rn on telegram
[11:35:07] <leobalter> wait
[11:35:19] <leobalter> everyone is online now (some bug on my client)
[11:35:31] <leobalter> jzaefferer gibson042  Krinkle JamesMGreene hello!
[11:39:18] <leobalter> I'll write this up on the related issue, but I'm thinking about dropping the QUnit.reporter proposal. I've been working a lot on web apps using node/npm and I believe we shouldn't have to call a QUnit native reporter method. With the event emitter (and even the current event methods) we should tell people to load the desired module.
[11:39:40] <leobalter> like in Babel, if you want the plugin to use it with react, you load babel and the babel react plugin
[11:39:49] <leobalter> no need to call extra stuff
[11:41:50] <leobalter> the node-qunit will still be useful to do the cli work and might accept different reporters, loaded from modules as well
[11:42:54] <leobalter> so QUnit is already ready to use on Node, just plug it and plug a reporter module. Calling from CLI is an extra
[11:43:41] <leobalter> said that, as I finish the event emitters, the only feature will be the deprecated warnings to support the migration process.
[11:53:35] <jzaefferer> leobalter: hey there
[11:53:44] <jzaefferer> just caught up on what you wrote above, sounds good
[11:54:05] <jzaefferer> seems like we're on the same page now :-)
[13:00:07] <m_gol> leobalter: sounds like you need to get op on #jquery-meeting so that you can have QUnit meetings in the proper place :)
[14:07:15] <robertmaxrees> getting reports that themeroller downloads are throwing a 502.

[19:27:05] <Krinkle> Hmm who knows the status of jQuery mechanise? I'm hoping to get my hands on another jQuery jumper like the blue one I got for becoming a member a few years back.
[19:27:33] <Krinkle> I recall at some point that went away and there being talk of a generic web shop.
[19:27:37] <Krinkle> But I can't find it
