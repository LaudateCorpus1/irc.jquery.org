[07:11:05] <gibson042> no, but it does inflate your grunt output

[11:19:16] <JamesMGreene> Just blogged, please share your thoughts. Thanks!  http://jamesonjavascript.wordpress.com/2013/03/11/javascript-required-reading/
[11:20:37] <JamesMGreene> Main topic I can think of that is missing is understanding asynchrony but I haven't seen any good posts on that
[11:29:10] <dcherman> JamesMGreene: https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js/ is another resource you might want to link to
[11:38:25] <JamesMGreene> dcherman It's been a while since I looked at idiomatic but isn't it essentially a style guide? Or has it evolved into more?
[11:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov DaveMethvin: I know you don't plan on ripping out .andSelf() yet, but I was just reading through the meeting log...
[11:40:32] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: hi
[11:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> I ripped out all uses of .andSelf() a while ago.
[11:40:44] <scott_gonzalez> We define .addBack() for old jQuery in UI core.
[11:40:49] <mikesherov> oh, right
[11:41:01] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: we discussed this
[11:41:07] <DaveMethvin> since it's not a lot of bytes to carry i'd prefer to avoid more people griping
[11:41:11] <mikesherov> I was saying that old UI needs andSelf
[11:41:43] <DaveMethvin> as long as UI isn't injecting script tags you'll be fine
[11:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well old UI + new core isn't much of a concern.
[11:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, it happens, but I think it's not too much of an issue.
[11:43:53] <DaveMethvin> we got a request to patch .curCSS() into jQuery Migrate, in particular b/c someone wanted an old UI to work
[11:44:01] <DaveMethvin> but is there a reason NOT to upgrade?
[11:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> No.
[11:44:15] <scott_gonzalez> They should just upgrade to 1.8.24.
[11:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> If they're on 1.7.x, they're SOL.
[11:44:57] <scott_gonzalez> Most people on 1.8.x should be able to upgrade to 1.9.2 without problems.
[11:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> But 1.8.24 should definitely be safe.
[11:45:14] <DaveMethvin> it's our first request for that, and if it's just UI it's already been fixed in the patch release
[11:45:24] <DaveMethvin> so i think i'll say no
[11:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> The patch would be `$.curCSS = $.css;` right?
[11:46:04] <DaveMethvin> right
[11:46:25] <DaveMethvin> guess it wouldn't hurt..
[11:46:34] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I guess for migrate, it needs logging.
[11:46:52] <DaveMethvin> right but i don't care about bytes there :D
[11:47:13] <DaveMethvin> so it's a call to log it and then re-apply
[11:47:26] <DaveMethvin> aw what the heck
[11:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> That DaveMethvin. He's such a nice guy.
[11:47:58] <DaveMethvin> sucker is the word you were looking for
[12:09:23] <dcherman> JamesMGreene: has a few best practices as well.  since your blog post is about improving javascript skills, i'd argue that style consistency is pretty important.  ditto with running a linter - i'd consider that required for improving your JS, long before i'd get into details about partial application or anything like that.  the simple stuff is surprisingly important.
[12:17:19] <JamesMGreene> True true
[12:43:45] <JamesMGreene> Shoot, wish Krinkle|detached was online
[12:59:44] <gf3> Psh
[13:02:35] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene well then, he wouldn't be Krinkle|detached WOULD  HE?
[13:03:39] <DaveMethvin> imma change my nick to DaveMethvin|unhinged
[13:04:03] <gf3> I will be gf3|unimpressed
[13:04:12] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:25:19] <JamesMGreene> C'mon stupid jQuery Tracker
[14:25:19] <JamesMGreene> I'm quite sure of my login
[14:25:20] <JamesMGreene> Y U NO LET ME IN?
[14:25:20] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: (å±®'Ð”')å±®
[14:26:37] <JamesMGreene> Is the Tracker broken?
[14:26:39] <JamesMGreene> I can't login
[14:26:46] <JamesMGreene> and my password reset email hasn't arrived
[14:27:05] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene what is your login name?
[14:32:47] <JamesMGreene> JamesMGreene
[14:32:54] <DaveMethvin> looks like you got in
[14:33:01] <JamesMGreene> I didn't
[14:33:04] <DaveMethvin> for tickets that old you're much better off creating a new one
[14:33:25] <JamesMGreene> I asked someone (you? I forget) and they said to ask for that one to reopen
[14:33:28] * JamesMGreene shrugs
[14:33:28] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[14:33:30] <JamesMGreene> I'm fine either way
[14:33:33] <JamesMGreene> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4825
[14:33:49] <DaveMethvin> i get an email on every one
[14:33:57] <JamesMGreene> Just sharing for the room ;)
[14:34:11] <JamesMGreene> But no, I never successfully logged in to Trac
[14:34:31] <DaveMethvin> so do you need a password reset?
[14:34:32] <JamesMGreene> I just typed my email/username in when commenting
[14:34:37] <JamesMGreene> I guess so...?
[14:34:50] <JamesMGreene> Pretty sure I used the right passwords... tried, like, all of mine
[14:34:58] <JamesMGreene> None worked
[14:35:32] <JamesMGreene> g2g
[14:35:43] <JamesMGreene> So open a new bug?
[14:35:47] <JamesMGreene> DaveMethvin ^
[14:36:27] <DaveMethvin> i'll just reuse that one
[14:36:46] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg worked it for th 1.5 rewrite, it would be unusual that he didn't have a regression test for it
[14:37:19] <JamesMGreene> He added a test in the referenced commit but it didn't make sense to me
[22:37:05] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle|detached yoooooyoyoyoyoyoyo
