[11:37:55] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Nice to have an about page. Want me to write up a blurp for myself?
[11:38:25] <Krinkle> I miss hanging out, wasn't able to attend any of the recent events.
[11:39:33] <Krinkle> I'm glad the new non-global context and assert stuff is catching on. As well as our approach to release it as a new feature yet non-breaking change  in the 1.x series I think was a good move. Similar to what Angular did as well.
