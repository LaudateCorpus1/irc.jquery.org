[01:18:31] <maqr> i think i found a bug: if you look at jQuery.ajaxPrefilter's "options.header", it's undefined unless you've specified a header, but the documentation says that the default value is {}
[06:11:30] <timmywil> docs#10000
[06:11:32] <bot-t> [#10000] the value got by calling position() in ie8 (bug but ""$("".content"").position()[""left""]"" returns a int value -739.This occurs in ie8.The value returned in firefox is -740.": 1.6.2) - http://jqbug.com/10000
[06:19:44] <gnarf> figures its not even like a real bug huh
[07:27:39] <scott_gonzalez> OMG, 5 digit bug numbers, jQuery sucks and we should all switch to My Library
[07:30:39] <tbranyen> 0 digit numbers on that lib
[08:19:40] <timmywil> is 0 a single-digit number or a a number that has no digits?  O.o
[08:48:45] <Krinkle> Who should I access if I would like to be able to add tags to issues in test swarm's github ?
[08:48:55] <Krinkle> s/access/ask
[08:50:12] <ajpiano> Krinkle: probably JohnResig, you should be able to catch him in the meetin in 10 minutes
[08:50:22] <Krinkle> Cool.
[08:52:08] <Krinkle> There's gonna be a lot of new issues and pull request for TestSwarm this week and next week. Pretty much everything has been rewritten at http://toolserver.org/~krinkle/testswarm by me for MediaWiki's JS unit testing for the Wikimedia Foundation. On the toolserver it was just a proof of concept. This week I'm re-doing it on a new server that will become accessible on testing.mediawiki.org , I've decided to start from a clean checkout and do pull req
[08:52:08] <Krinkle> timely this time :)
[08:53:16] <Krinkle> Query caching, profile pages indication for 'users' and 'projects' (projects can be marked by admins, logged in projects can get their addjob-token), several bug fixes and more.
[08:54:06] <timmywil> When I hear "meeting time", I sing "closing time".  just fyi
[08:54:23] <Krinkle> And a new HTML/CSS front, probably gonna base that on html5 boilerplate instead.
[09:01:44] <ajpiano> are folks even here to have a meeting
[09:02:56] <timmywil> im here
[09:03:04] <timmywil> JohnResig?
[09:03:19] <ajpiano> no dave or rick
[09:03:22] <ajpiano> or julian
[09:03:30] <ajpiano> gnarf might be ?
[09:03:35] <timmywil> julian is here
[09:03:38] <timmywil> in the meeting room
[09:03:45] <ajpiano> ohh
[09:03:51] <timmywil> as is gnarf and addy
[09:41:00] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I can get you access, ping me here or on Skype (joern.zaefferer, we've got a testing team group there, too)
[09:41:21] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: ping :) - adding on Skype as well
[09:41:28] <jzaefferer> I've merged some updates last week, so apart from the currently still open pull request, there's not that much pending
[09:42:02] <Krinkle> True, I haven't send any pulls yet for the MediaWiki project.
[10:39:47] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: http://jquerytesting.pbworks.com/w/page/44098626/TestSwarm-UserRewrite
[11:38:51] <ryanneufeld> rwaldron: do you have a tool you use for formatting to jquery conventions, or do you just do it all by hand?
[11:39:07] <rwaldron> by hand
[11:39:36] <ryanneufeld> dang, I'm very lazy :p
[11:39:47] <rwaldron> the only external tool i use is an on-save command in textmate that removes empty whitespace from the end of lines and from empty lines
[11:40:04] <rwaldron> could easily be a pre-commit hook
[11:40:10] <ryanneufeld> yeah, i use the same thing
[11:40:21] <rwaldron> i let jshint tell me if tabs and spaces are mixed on the same line
[11:40:27] <rwaldron> otherwise, i just write code like that
[11:41:10] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I do as well, but I'm going back and updating old code to support new features, so I'm looking for a tool to add all the appropriate formatting
[11:41:52] <rwaldron> i need to do the same
[11:41:58] <rwaldron> i hate my old code
[11:42:07] <ryanneufeld> I hate code I wrote a month ago :p
[11:42:36] <ryanneufeld> I've opened files and went "who wrote this garbage" only to check svn blame and find out it was me :p
[11:42:58] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Should I use jQuery conventions for JS for TestSwarm PHP code (mostly works, just curous)
[11:43:05] <Krinkle> BRB after dinner
[11:43:13] <Krinkle> (whitespace, quotes etc.)
[11:45:36] <paul_irish> Krinkle: we're just about to put out a new version so use hte h5bp thats in github
[11:45:53] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: yeah, makes sense
[12:18:26] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Sorry, I got disconnected. Did you see my question about coding style ?
[12:18:41] <Krinkle> back
[12:23:07] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: yeah, saw it, makes sense, lets do it!
[12:23:18] <Krinkle> k, already started :)
[12:24:39] <Krinkle> gonna be a big commit
[12:27:28] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Where would I put additional stuff for PHP specific stuff ?
[12:27:44] <Krinkle> Might as well restrain that before it goes on the loose (or already is)
[12:31:09] <jzaefferer> no idea, feel free to come up with something reasonable
[12:31:31] <jzaefferer> as long as URLs etc. keeping working, I'd be fine with rewriting pretty much the whole PHP backend
[12:31:45] <Krinkle> Sure
[12:31:50] <Krinkle> github wiki ok ?
[12:32:20] <jzaefferer> except for the users table, I'd also be fine refactoring the database
[12:32:27] <jzaefferer> wiki for what?
[12:33:54] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/wiki/Style-Guidelines
[12:57:33] <maqr> is there a reason why jQuery.ajaxPrefilter's "options.header" is undefined unless you've specified a header, but the documentation says that the default value for the header is {} (not undefined)?
[13:02:15] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Do you know who has access to jquery.com/demos ? There's an html injection venerability (one I better not post in public)
[13:43:51] <danheberden> Krinkle you mean jqueryui.com/demos?
[13:43:58] <Krinkle> yep
[13:44:10] <Krinkle> Sorry, that's what I meant. Yes, jQuery UI
[13:44:40] <Krinkle> Please PM with some kind of way to know that you're trusted and I'll send the example-link
[13:44:48] <ajpiano> huh
[13:44:50] <ajpiano> Krinkle:
[13:44:56] <ajpiano> danheberden: is the infrastructure lead for the jquery project
[13:45:11] <danheberden> but i wouldn't go so far as to say i'm trusted
[13:45:16] <ajpiano> heh :)
[13:45:27] <danheberden> i once defaced jquery with a picture of bruce willis
[13:45:30] <Krinkle> ajpiano: Sorry, I'm new here. But I know you ajpiano, so that's that.
[13:45:47] <ajpiano> no problemo :)
[13:45:52] <Krinkle> PM sent to danheberden
[13:46:20] <danheberden> luckily there is no 'admin' portion of the site for injection of that nature, getting passwords or hijacking cookies
[13:48:35] <Krinkle> Well, it won't risk leaking info. But it may very well leak info from other sites (ie. redirecting to a spam site, or stuff like that)
[13:55:27] <danheberden> yeah, that's the issue with that - some jq link that's all of a sudden got penises on it or something
[13:59:31] <rwaldron> danheberden ajpiano http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy17eyjnxsk
[13:59:38] <rwaldron> yeah. the future is actually at bocoup
[13:59:49] <rwaldron> its not just a fun t-shirt slogan
[14:01:45] <danheberden> that's hawt, rwaldron
[14:01:56] <danheberden> i wanna bind to xbox controller buttons!
[14:08:46] <tbranyen> danheberden: works with ps3 controller too
[14:08:47] <tbranyen> which is awesome
[14:09:23] <danheberden> yay! i like X, square, circle and triangle better
[14:17:51] <ryanneufeld> rwaldron: that is fucking bad ass!!!
[14:19:44] * ryanneufeld needs to get an arduino and an xbox controller... 
[15:37:57] <maqr> does anyone know what the callback to $.ajaxPrefilter should return? if i return "options.success" or "jqXHR", the calls seem to work, but if i return "random string", the ajax calls fails entirely... any idea what the proper thing to do is? i'm just trying to modify some headers before the xhr goes out
[15:44:17] <ajpiano> the proper thing to do is not to return anything
[15:44:38] <ajpiano> that's why i asked where you got the idea that returning something from that method was something you should do
[15:45:55] <maqr> ajpiano: some of the examples have returns in them
[15:46:11] <maqr> see the one above "converters" on http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/
[15:46:28] <ajpiano> ah i think i see what is going on
[15:47:09] <maqr> ajpiano: and the reason i noticed is because CoffeeScript is returning whatever the last statement's value is
[15:47:15] <maqr> i don't know if javascript does that too, i think it does?
[15:47:25] <ajpiano> it assumes that if you return a string, it's a datatype
[15:47:33] <ajpiano> ( i think)
[15:47:36] <ajpiano> no, javascript does not do that
[15:47:40] <ajpiano> that is just coffeescript emulating ruby
[15:47:42] <maqr> ah
[15:47:52] <maqr> so should i return {}, nil, null, or figure out how to make coffeescript return nothing?
[15:49:03] <ajpiano> i would probably add an explicit return
[15:50:45] <maqr> yeah, that's what i just did and it seems to work
[15:50:51] <maqr> maybe i'll just not ask questions about the return value then, heh
[15:51:29] <ajpiano> well i think you're now aware of a caveat to be careful of if you're using cofeescript :)
[15:52:16] <ajpiano> there are probably library functions that expect either no return, or react in a specific way when returning something that is supposed to do X but doesn't.
[15:52:48] <maqr> yeah, who would have thought
