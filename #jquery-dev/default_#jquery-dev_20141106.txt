[09:14:43] <doesallmagic2> joern.zaefferer: Build: Specify valid components for commit messages
[11:57:42] <m_gol> jzaefferer: is there a specific reason why QUnit.dump tests are not run on Android 2.3?
[11:58:51] <m_gol> Krinkle|detached JamesMGreene leobalter ^
[11:59:15] <leobalter> no
[11:59:24] <m_gol> :)
[11:59:35] <leobalter> as far I know, they should run there
[11:59:48] <m_gol> yeah, I don't see any place in the code that explicitely excludes them
[12:00:04] <m_gol> and yet they're skipped; see e.g.: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3805
[12:04:25] <m_gol> leobalter: anyway, just head ups; I don't have a lot of time to pinpoint the issue, I thought I'll at least let you know since I can't see the reason immediately
[12:06:43] <jzaefferer> m_gol leobalter: if you look back a bit further, there are runs where it runs all tests, there are also some where its missing a lot more. I just ran on two different 2.3 devices through BrowserStack, and it ran all tests
[12:07:26] <jzaefferer> dunno what's going on, but seems pretty random. Not sure if worth investigating, since it sometimes runs all tests, so eventually we'd notice issues on 2.3
[12:08:06] <m_gol> ha, right
[12:08:24] <m_gol> jzaefferer: you just need to remember to check periodically if there were runs that didn't skip tests
[12:11:05] <leobalter> master branch is not giving a clue why it's not running. 
[12:11:58] <leobalter> jzaefferer m_gol: worth investigating if browserstack is caching test/index.html from before this commit: @a69a112
[12:12:30] <m_gol> well, BrowserStack is run on freshly restored VMs, it shouldn't have anything cached
[12:13:37] <jzaefferer> leobalter: if you look through QUnit jobs on TestSwarm, you can see some with all tests and some with much less running on 2.3. Don't think its anything recent
[12:14:30] <leobalter> I know, but I'm considering anything as we don't have more clues, and the commit is from 2 months 
[12:15:06] <leobalter> There's no other reason I see to make this random dropping
