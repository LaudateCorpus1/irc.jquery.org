[21:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: ping
[21:44:13] <DaveMethvin> sup scott_gonzalez 
[21:44:38] <scott_gonzalez> For events, have you tried using defineProperty on jQuery.Event.prototype or just on the instances?
[21:46:06] <DaveMethvin> not sure i understand
[21:46:36] <scott_gonzalez> To avoid doing all the property copying during event fixing.
[21:46:48] <DaveMethvin> take a look at what's in core now
[21:46:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[21:47:07] <DaveMethvin> i think we're doing what you're saying now
[21:52:54] <scott_gonzalez> I like that :-)
[21:53:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah it took way too long to land but finally we got to a set of browsers that wouldn't break with it
[21:54:19] <DaveMethvin> i would still love to use Object.create(event) but it doesn't work on our 3.0 browser set ... i think it IE and Firefox don't like it
[21:55:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[21:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> I should read through the core code again. It's been a few years since I stopped watching every commit.
