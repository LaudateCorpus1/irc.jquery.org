[03:23:44] <jqcommit> 13qunit/06bower-json 1415d8b77 15JoÌˆrn Zaefferer: Add bower.json. Fixes #461
[03:58:22] <m_gol> why `bower install jquery` installs a migrate plugin, too?
[03:58:33] <m_gol> it should be a separate item
[03:58:47] <m_gol> timmywil, DaveMethvin?
[03:59:01] <m_gol> DaveMethvin|away?
[03:59:58] <m_gol> not to mention we have both bower.json and component.json in the bundle
[04:39:10] <uGoMobi> m_gol: ping!
[04:39:19] <m_gol> uGoMobi: pong
[04:39:34] <uGoMobi> m_gol: hey!
[04:39:41] <m_gol> hey, what's up?
[04:39:44] <uGoMobi> m_gol: did you just receive mail from me?
[04:40:10] <m_gol> uGoMobi: yes, I see one now :)
[04:40:56] <uGoMobi> m_gol: ok great... thought my mailserver crashed or something so I wanted to check
[04:56:50] <m_gol> uGoMobi: np, would be great to meet in Europe! :)
[05:58:00] <scott_gonzalez> Why does Sizzle have different commenting conventions than other projects?
[09:19:25] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:19:50] <DaveMethvin> m_gol are you still seeing the error  you reported in https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=247909 ?
[09:20:05] <DaveMethvin> I have something similar that doesn't happen in Chrome 27 but does in Chrome 30 canary
[09:20:17] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I'll check
[09:20:30] <DaveMethvin> it disappears if i tell chrome to skip the cache
[09:22:49] <m_gol> hmm, can't reproduce it anymore
[09:23:18] <DaveMethvin> well my bug seems similar, i'll have to narrow it down
[09:23:31] <DaveMethvin> btw did  your boss like his new macbook air?
[09:23:48] <m_gol> yep, with one caveat, some WiFi problems
[09:24:01] <m_gol> fortunately Apple's warranty is worldwide ;)
[09:24:10] <DaveMethvin> sweet!
[09:24:35] <m_gol> btw, I see I missed a switch to bower for jQuery dependencies :D
[09:25:06] <m_gol> I've tried to use it one day but why the jquery bower package has the migrate plugin bundled?
[09:25:12] <DaveMethvin> i still need to pull that and make sure it all works for me
[09:25:12] <m_gol> it seems it should be a separate item
[09:25:19] <DaveMethvin> agree they should not have it by defult
[09:25:22] <DaveMethvin> default
[09:25:53] <m_gol> that's one reason I gave up for now on bower in my company's current project
[09:26:24] <m_gol> the grunt task including everything from components/jquery/*.min.js wasn't doing what I wanted ;)
[09:26:35] <m_gol> who controls the jquery bower package?
[09:26:48] <DaveMethvin> not sure tbh
[09:26:54] <jqcommit> [13jquery.com] 15jdorfman closed pull request #41: CDN Tab [NOT READY] (06master...06maxcdn)  02http://git.io/JfOdCA
[09:27:32] <m_gol> how will we keep jQuery in sync with Sizzle fixes with bower?
[09:27:59] <jqcommit> [13jquery.com] 15jdorfman opened pull request #42: added cdn.md [NOT READY] (06master...06jdmaxcdn)  02http://git.io/1Y7aXw
[09:28:03] <m_gol> I mean, that's obvious for stable releases but we need to update Sizzle a couple of times before when a Sizzle bug occurs
[09:28:33] <DaveMethvin> we'll just pull the final Sizzle file from that repo i thought
[09:28:47] <DaveMethvin> i'll have to go look at the entire plumbing process 
[09:29:00] <m_gol> I mean what about jquery-git2.js build etc
[09:29:05] <m_gol> :)
[09:29:29] <DaveMethvin> that is done by testswarm and it will build from the repo at that point
[09:30:20] <m_gol> seems a dev cycle might get a little more complicated :)
[09:30:39] <m_gol> I'll have to manually pull Sizzle now to build current master version, right?
[09:30:44] <m_gol> no more just `grunt` and done?
[09:30:54] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: I don't think TestSwarm does that
[09:31:03] <DaveMethvin> sorry the jenkins build
[09:31:08] <Krinkle> (unless we have the git submodule still)
[09:31:15] <Krinkle> or Jenkins for that matter
[09:31:26] <Krinkle> or was Jenkins updated to do this now? Because it didn't before
[09:32:01] <DaveMethvin> jenkins was doing the builds before jzaefferer moved it, and i believe it was fixed to do it after as well
[09:32:28] <Krinkle> The last two jenkins builds (one for the commit that introduced bower, and one after) both fail fatally before grunt even starts
[09:32:32] <Krinkle> http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/854/console
[09:32:45] <DaveMethvin> yes, i have noticed that
[09:32:53] <DaveMethvin> and my login no longer seems to work
[09:32:57] <DaveMethvin> so i haven't investigated
[09:33:10] <DaveMethvin> but i can't investigate now either
[09:33:13] <Krinkle> Warning: Unable to read "bower_components/sizzle/dist/sizzle.js" file (Error code: ENOENT). Use --force to continue. 
[09:33:29] <Krinkle> I'm not sure but it looks like something generic that will happen locally as well
[09:33:38] <Krinkle> It's because there's no bower installed
[09:33:56] <DaveMethvin> i think jenkins doesn't do a full npm install does it?
[09:34:05] <DaveMethvin> we have to force that somehow when we update
[09:34:36] <Krinkle> It does
[09:35:06] <Krinkle> It does a full 'npm install' each build
[09:35:20] <DaveMethvin> ok then i am remembering wrong
[09:35:41] <DaveMethvin> timmywil any idea why the jenkins build would fail on bower?
[09:36:12] <Krinkle> It doesn't fail on bower
[09:36:16] <timmywil> perhaps bower is not on the jenkins server
[09:36:16] <Krinkle> it doesn't *have* bower :)
[09:36:29] <Krinkle> There is no where it says to do "bower install"
[09:36:40] <Krinkle> the only place that is is "readme"
[09:36:48] <DaveMethvin> oh!
[09:36:55] <DaveMethvin> ok then we need to install bower
[09:36:57] <DaveMethvin> duh
[09:37:51] <timmywil> I don't know much about the jenkins config. Whereever we tell jenkins to npm install, we'll need to add bower install.
[09:38:07] <Krinkle> done
[09:38:11] <Krinkle> http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/856/console
[09:38:12] <Krinkle> still failing
[09:38:26] <Krinkle> did you (anyone) even test plain "grunt" before committing?
[09:38:31] * Krinkle tries locally
[09:38:32] <timmywil> that doesn't look like a bower problem
[09:38:34] <Krinkle> could be a jenkins bug
[09:38:37] <Krinkle> indeed
[09:38:44] <timmywil> it's failing because jshint was updated
[09:38:49] <timmywil> I can fix that
[09:38:53] <Krinkle> bower works now (look at build 854 for the bower failure that is now solved in 856)
[09:39:02] <Krinkle> http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/854/console
[09:39:38] <timmywil> for some reason, jshint added an error for when you have es5: true in your jshintrc
[09:41:03] <Krinkle> timmywil: this one can be a bit tricky (might need more than remoing plain es5:true), so please do test it locally this time so that after this commit those warnings are gone :)
[09:41:24] <Krinkle> had a similar bug in qunit job a few weeks back when we switched
[09:41:45] <timmywil> I had tested locally, but I was bouncing between branches and forgot an npm install.
[09:42:11] <DaveMethvin> beentheredonethat
[09:42:25] <m_gol> ekhm
[09:42:34] <m_gol> my pull request from long ago fixes these problems
[09:42:36] <m_gol> about jshint
[09:42:41] <m_gol> while updating packages :P
[09:42:45] <m_gol> could we merge that?
[09:43:11] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1282
[09:43:12] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #1282 by mzgol (1mon 1w ago): Update devDependencies, adjust .jshintrc to jsHint 2.x, use .jshintignore
[09:43:18] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1283
[09:43:18] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #1283 by mzgol (1mon 1w ago): Update devDependencies, adjust .jshintrc to jsHint 2.x, use .jshintignore
[09:43:28] <DaveMethvin> heck, YOU could merge that.  I'm not against it i'm just lazy
[09:43:33] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:43:47] <m_gol> I know, I just didn't want to merge things without consulting :)
[09:44:22] <m_gol> at least non-trivial changes ;)
[09:44:49] <timmywil> I'll merge them both in case there are conflicts
[09:46:21] <m_gol> some of these packages might have newer versions now
[09:46:39] <m_gol> maybe I'll check first if something else could be updated as well, timmywil?
[09:47:13] <timmywil> m_gol: It's ok, I just checked. They're all at latest.
[09:47:28] <timmywil> well, what I have after handling the conflicts is the latest
[09:47:47] <m_gol> timmywil: they're not, grunt-contrib-uglify is 0.2.2 and the newest one is 0.2.3
[09:48:03] <timmywil> yea I got that
[09:48:21] <m_gol> this es5 warning is weird
[09:48:40] <m_gol> no other option is not thrown in your face only because you explicitely define it to be the same value as by default
[09:48:55] <m_gol> especially that both this warning and makind es5 default was commited at the same time
[09:49:01] <m_gol> * makind -> making
[09:50:08] <timmywil> m_gol: wait, actually I still see 0.2.2 as the latest
[09:50:21] <m_gol> ah, maybe it's only on github
[09:50:29] <m_gol> they didn't publish it to npm apparently
[09:51:27] <m_gol> k, so 0.2.2 it is

[10:03:22] <timmywil> m_gol: no thank you
[10:04:35] <timmywil> hmm, having trouble loading github
[10:05:08] <timmywil> or, more specificaly their static assets server
[10:05:13] <m_gol> me too
[10:07:26] <DaveMethvin> fyi https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=259400
[10:11:53] <timmywil> Krinkle: can you add bower cache-clean to the jenkins build? When QUnit gets registered, the cached repo will be wrong.
[10:12:26] <Krinkle> What do you mean by it will be wrong
[10:12:41] <Krinkle> Oh, i see
[10:13:25] <timmywil> If I ever have an issue with bower, cache-clean usually fixes it. Jenkins doing that by default should avoid most problems.
[10:13:48] <Krinkle> done, and triggered a new build
[10:14:33] <timmywil> cool, looks right
[10:14:34] <timmywil> thanks

[12:53:13] <JamesMGreene> Heeeeey DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez et al: does anyone recall if there was a jQuery core ticket ever filed jQuery.type() returning 'object' instead of 'function' for oldIE host objects?
[12:53:44] <JamesMGreene> I've been searching Trac but struggling to find any such thing
[12:54:01] <JamesMGreene> (though I also don't know if Trac has an advanced query capabilities)
[12:54:06] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene i think it's specifically on the wontfix if you mean things like jQuery.type(window.alert)
[12:55:01] <JamesMGreene> right
[12:55:04] <DaveMethvin> nope not there http://contribute.jquery.org/wont-fix/
[12:55:12] <DaveMethvin> but it should be :)
[12:55:27] <JamesMGreene> Curious... I know it's a PITA, but why WontFix?
[12:55:37] <JamesMGreene> It's definitely doable
[12:56:33] <DaveMethvin> even if you return "function" for window.alert, what happens if someone wants to .apply it for example?
[12:56:44] <DaveMethvin> i mean, functions ALWAYS have apply
[12:56:46] <DaveMethvin> right?
[12:59:12] <DaveMethvin> that's my reason and I'm sticking to it JamesMGreene :) http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4536
[12:59:55] <DaveMethvin> and we do document for isFunctoin http://api.jquery.com/jquery.isfunction/
[13:00:48] <DaveMethvin> The docs for http://api.jquery.com/jquery.type/ are correct as is but if you wanted to mentoin oldIE host objects you could add a pull for it
[13:04:31] <JamesMGreene> DaveMethvin: I see your point but I'd still disagree
[13:05:41] <JamesMGreene> Hmm
[13:05:49] <JamesMGreene> Maybe I'll change my tune
[13:06:08] <JamesMGreene> Chrome used to not allow you to call host methods with .call/.apply either but it looks like they work now
[13:06:38] <DaveMethvin> well then all you have to do is convince microsoft to reissue ie6/7/8 with a fix and you're done!
[13:07:24] <JamesMGreene> The only caveat is that you MUST pass the host method's parent object as the context or else it will die in Chrome
[13:07:37] <JamesMGreene> i.e.  `console.log.apply(console, ['blah'])` works
[13:07:48] <JamesMGreene> but i.e.  `console.log.apply(null, ['blah'])` fails
[13:14:12] <JamesMGreene> Works in Firefox, though
[13:14:16] <JamesMGreene> Crazy ole host methods
[13:16:14] <JamesMGreene> Maybe I'll make a little `isNativeFunction` plugin
[13:17:10] <JamesMGreene> P.S. Can't log in to Trac again  :(
[16:39:43] <josher> I've got a question for some more experienced developers in here. I've been told contributing to open source projects look good on the resume. I'd love to contribute to jQuery but I'm thrown off on how to start. Do you just pick a bug and work it?
