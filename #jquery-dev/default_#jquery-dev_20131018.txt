[08:56:47] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Migrate Core 1.x build #120: STILL FAILING in 8 min 44 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core%201.x/120/
[09:06:55] <jzaefferer> gibson042 m_gol markelog mikesherov timmywil: Is this valid? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14352 / we're probably going to work around it in UI anyway, but I'd like to see it addressed, if valid.
[09:11:24] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: ^^^
[09:13:49] <timmywil> jzaefferer: yea, that's the value I would expect for document height rather than window height
[09:14:24] <timmywil> maybe it's failing the window check?
[09:14:52] <timmywil> but if that is the value for documentElement.clientHeight, that'd be a tough fix
[09:17:10] <timmywil> ah, which it is
[09:18:40] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: quirks mode
[09:18:47] <mikesherov> timmywil: quirks mode
[09:20:12] <timmywil> ah, good call mikesherov

[09:21:27] <mikesherov> timmywil: lol jinx
[09:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> markelog: Added some more features to recursive-blame on the flight home :-)
[09:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> It now handles multiple matches per revision.
[09:28:44] <scott_gonzalez> And you can even walk back through history to find the pattern. For example, `recursive-blame src/traversing.js nextElement` will ask if you want to walk through history until it finds a revision that has "nextElement" in it.
[09:53:11] <jzaefferer> thanks timmywil mikesherov
[10:41:30] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: how is recursive-blame different than git log -S
[10:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> -S only shows additions and removals, not modifications.
[10:43:16] <mikesherov> what do you mean modification?
[10:43:33] <scott_gonzalez> Let's say you search for "createButtons"
[10:43:34] <mikesherov> what else is on a diff besides additions and deletions?
[10:44:33] <scott_gonzalez> `git log -S` will only show you commits where that string was introduced or removed
[10:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> recursive-blame will show you commits where that string appears in the diff.
[10:45:20] <scott_gonzalez> so if you had a commit that changed `createButtons( "foo" )` to `createButtons( "bar" )` it'd show up in recursive-blame
[10:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> recursive-blame also focuses in on the actual change that you care about.
[10:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> And it shows file contents as the output, not difs.
[10:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: You can view sample output in jzaefferer's blog post that he just wrote: http://t.co/VbLSsbTScR
[10:48:09] <mikesherov> awesome
