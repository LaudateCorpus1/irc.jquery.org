[06:25:44] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: probably wednesday or  thursday, wanted to wait for timmy to come back from vacay
[06:26:14] <DaveMethvin> mainly just trying to fix our testing issues and see what bugs must be fixed that are still open
[06:26:19] <DaveMethvin> i think we got most of the big ones
[06:28:12] <scott_gonzalez> I ran through all of the 1-8-stable demos in Chrome using jquery-git.
[06:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf and I fixed a few bugs (some in UI, some (one?) in core).
[06:28:54] <scott_gonzalez> So I think I'm ready to do the 1.8.22 release.
[06:29:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cool
[07:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: So I'm dying to know what you wanted to say to me the other day ;-)

[10:11:50] <timmywil> I landed your pull on relative selectors and event delegation, but there's a fail
[10:13:17] <timmywil> maybe it's my fault
[10:15:17] <gibson042> ok; I'll check

[10:24:23] <timmywil> hmmm
[10:24:35] <gibson042> you might have just noticed a hiccup in between Sizzle renaming globalPOS and jQuery looking for the new name
[10:25:50] <timmywil> yea, I'm at the same sha. I'm testing locally tho
[10:26:36] <timmywil> oh, you know what...
[10:26:46] <timmywil> oh nvm
[10:26:52] <timmywil> thought maybe it was my cache
[10:27:25] <timmywil> yea, it's just not triggering the first click in the new test
[10:29:29] <gibson042> so which part appears to be failing?

[12:10:47] <timmywil> problem is in tokenize
[12:11:25] <timmywil> needs to check context, but adding a space to the front still doesn't add a descendent combinator if the selector starts with another combinator

[13:33:53] <mikesherov> b-ot: read
[13:33:53] <b-ot> mikesherov, from gnarf, 1d 19h ago: how about just make it a GET param to the test... IE. on mine it could be http://jquery.local/jquery/test/unit?cors=http://not.jquery.local/jquery/
[13:33:58] <b-ot> mikesherov, from gnarf, 1d 18h ago: swarm would always have it in the url because its defined in the swarm submission.  Also is it possible to have a consistent endpoint online? then you could just enable it for those of us who need to test it with like ?cors in the url
[13:42:09] <gibson042> yes
[13:59:55] <elijahmanor> is rick here?
