[10:20:51] <_markelog> jzaefferer: awesome! Thank you
[10:36:26] <m_gol> gibson042: I'm starting to understand your distaste for differing test suites...
[10:36:52] <gibson042> what bit you?
[10:37:07] <m_gol> Android 2.3 fails on AJAX test
[10:37:10] <m_gol> but only on master
[10:37:15] <m_gol> and this test differs between branches
[10:37:21] <m_gol> in 2.x is async, in 1.x it's made sync
[10:37:29] <gibson042> ick
[10:37:31] <gibson042> yeah
[10:37:41] <m_gol> when I copy the 2.x async test to 1.x, it fails there as well
[10:37:52] <m_gol> but when I copy the sync one to 2.x, it fails even in Chrome
[10:38:13] <m_gol> so I guess this sync test was a little hacky and the hack doesn't work anymore in 2.x
[10:38:22] <m_gol> but its asyncness breaks Android 2.3
[10:38:40] <m_gol> I mean, the asyncness of the jQuery 2.x modification of this test
[10:38:48] <gibson042> what a pain
[10:39:43] <m_gol> funny enough, locally (i.e. on an emulator this test times out)
[10:39:59] <m_gol> but on TestSwarm it times out testswarm instead :P
[10:40:19] <m_gol> so half of AJAX tests are not even executed on Android 2.3
[10:40:47] <m_gol> en example: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1804776
[10:41:04] <m_gol> stops at "ajax: #11743 - jQuery.ajax() - script, throws exception" and that's all you can get!
[10:41:14] <m_gol> ok, that's not half
[10:41:21] <m_gol> but still, 40 tests are left unexecuted
[10:41:22] <gibson042> but still, ouch
[10:42:25] <m_gol> now I need to figure out which of the things we take for granted are missing on Android 2.3 so that this test timeouts :-)
[10:43:59] <gibson042> I wonder how Android 2.3 feels about `throws`
[10:44:15] <gibson042> but I guess that wouldn't leave us hanging to time out
[10:52:52] <m_gol> I don't think "throws" is reserved anywhere except ES3 ;)
[10:52:57] <m_gol> even IE6 doesn't have it reserved
[10:53:29] <m_gol> haha
[10:53:30] <m_gol> ok
[10:53:38] <gibson042> heh
[10:53:42] <m_gol> gibson042: Android 2.3 doesn't support async on script tags ;)
[10:53:56] <m_gol> and the script transport sets that
[10:54:07] <gibson042> wow
[10:54:31] <m_gol> hm, but IE9 doesn't support it either... http://caniuse.com/script-async
[10:54:35] <m_gol> and yet it doesn't break there
[10:54:47] <gibson042> they may be implicitly async on IE9
[10:54:53] <m_gol> right
[10:56:16] <gibson042> still, I didn't think we relied on sync vs. async evaluation for anything
[10:56:37] <gibson042> at least, not in that code
[10:57:05] <m_gol> if it's sync, it throws in the main loop and may prevent the window.onerror handler to fire, right?
[10:57:27] <gibson042> oooh, yeah it would when QUnit intercepts
[10:57:32] <m_gol> that would break the test
[10:57:55] <m_gol> so maybe in Android 2.3 we could use try-catch for it instead
[10:58:11] <gibson042> +1
[10:59:38] <m_gol> yep, that works :)
[11:00:06] <m_gol> btw, could you look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1572 re the cross-manip failing tests in 2.3? I've modified tests and now they pass
[11:00:19] <gibson042> will do

[12:36:00] <m_gol> gibson042: weird... when I tried to recreate what the script transport does and just create a script tag linking to a throwing script with async: true and append it to head, it throws synchronously not only in Android 2.3 but also in Chrome; Fx doesn't throw
[12:45:36] <m_gol> gibson042: no, my mistake, it just doesn't go to the onerror handler then (and I looked at the wrong test in Fx since numbers don't match)
