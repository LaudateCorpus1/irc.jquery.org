[05:28:32] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: did you see IE8 is no longer hanging in swarm?
[05:28:35] <m_gol> only 6-7
[05:28:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's a good sign
[05:28:51] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to see if clearTimeout helps
[05:29:01] <DaveMethvin> but at least we're making progress
[05:31:24] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: or did you break swarmy on IE6-7 on purpose to have an argument for San Diego? ]:->
[05:31:43] <DaveMethvin> :)
[05:32:03] <m_gol> what has happened to IE8? http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1522743
[05:32:08] <m_gol> 20 failures in offset
[05:32:41] <DaveMethvin> in the past that has happened when someone changes the CSS in the iframe outside the test frame
[05:32:53] <DaveMethvin> which of course should NEVER BREAK ANYTHING inside the teste iframe
[05:32:56] <DaveMethvin> but it does
[05:33:12] <m_gol> ha, that looks like it
[05:33:17] <DaveMethvin> i think Krinkle made a change there yesterday, lessee
[05:33:18] <m_gol> since there is no longer an overflow: scroll there
[05:33:46] <m_gol> so weird
[05:34:04] <m_gol> and they're all favorite kind of bugs
[05:34:06] <m_gol> off by one
[05:34:13] <DaveMethvin> yep
[05:34:45] <m_gol> maybe leaving overflow: scroll as it was but just making the iframe way higher would help?
[05:36:50] <DaveMethvin> i was looking for the last time it broke, i know mikesherov spent some time looking at it and found that changing the css a bit made swarmy work
[05:37:10] <DaveMethvin> but i don't see the commit by him in /jquery/testswarm
[05:37:36] <DaveMethvin> really, github's search is the suck
[05:38:02] <m_gol> git log is your friend
[05:38:19] <m_gol> but you need a clone
[05:38:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah, definitely better luck doing that
[05:38:28] <DaveMethvin> that's the way i find things in jquery
[05:38:45] <m_gol> :)
[05:38:50] <DaveMethvin> but github should WEB ALL THE THINGS
[05:39:00] <m_gol> they started with online PRs
[05:40:13] <DaveMethvin> between the PR and the related discussion, there is a lot of stuff missing from from the repo
[05:40:24] <DaveMethvin> i guess the pr is there if you fetch
[05:40:28] <DaveMethvin> but not the discussion
[05:45:33] <DaveMethvin> m_gol found the commit, changing the font size got rid of the 1px difference in this case: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/commit/3288a9b7f38edaca8760991e90027be9aedb1095
[06:37:11] <DaveMethvin> okay, now would be a good time to publish the blog and update the download page
[06:38:41] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Are you trying to search for commits by user in GitHub?
[06:39:05] <DaveMethvin> turned out i was trying to search for the wrong user so i never would have found it that way
[06:39:58] <DaveMethvin> so scott_gonzalez  to double check
[06:40:10] <DaveMethvin> when updating jquery.com it's npm version patch and push --tags right?
[06:41:21] <scott_gonzalez> `git push && push --tags` or `git push origin master --tags`
[06:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> You need to push the commit as well, not just the tag.
[06:41:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:41:46] <scott_gonzalez> Other than that, yes.
[06:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> `npm version patch` and then push.
[06:42:19] <scott_gonzalez> http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/#deploying-to-staging-and-production-environments :-)
[06:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: For future reference, you can do https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits?author=dmethvin if you ever need it.
[06:43:41] <DaveMethvin> can that be done with comments as well?
[06:43:48] <DaveMethvin> that's what it turned out i needed
[06:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> nope :-/
[06:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> You mean commit comments, right? Not commit message.
[06:44:50] <DaveMethvin> PR comments, commit comments, all text really
[06:45:12] <DaveMethvin> like, a full text search
[06:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they don't seem to support that.
[06:46:03] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think they support doing any type of searching on comments.
[06:46:22] <scott_gonzalez> Other than "Filter issues with X comments"
[06:47:42] <m_gol> the beta tag wasn't updated
[06:47:49] <m_gol> it's still on rc1
[06:48:03] <DaveMethvin> what should happen to the beta tag?
[06:48:11] <DaveMethvin> should it stay on the last beta?
[06:48:38] <m_gol> I think it should point to the latest version from all betas, rcs & releases
[06:48:51] <m_gol> so if there's no beta/rc newer than latest stable, it should point to that
[06:49:05] <m_gol> so that if sb wants to live on a bleeding edge they don't actually get an obsolete version
[06:49:42] <DaveMethvin> seems reasonable
[06:50:01] <m_gol> I guess this should be handled by jquery-release
[06:50:27] <DaveMethvin> draft blog post for review: http://blog.jquery.com/?p=3344&preview=true&preview_id=3344&public=1&nonce=0b7c0af7f5
[06:50:39] <DaveMethvin> i think i have everything changed, just need to double check it
[06:50:48] <DaveMethvin> milestones/versions are updated on trac
[06:51:33] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Filed: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/issues/30
[06:51:41] <jqcommit> [13jquery-release] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #30: NPM: Always set the beta tag 02http://git.io/jXigqw
[06:54:17] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: what is the "component" for this commit message? it's updating index.html and download.md
[06:55:17] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Sometimes it gets really tricky for sites :-/
[06:55:28] <scott_gonzalez> You can use the generic "Pages" component.
[06:55:40] <scott_gonzalez> Or "jQuery: Upgrade to x.y.z"
[06:55:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was looking back at older commits and not getting much guidance :)
[06:56:00] <DaveMethvin> i don't think it matters much for this repo
[06:56:06] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[06:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> We don't generate changelogs for sites.
[06:56:14] <DaveMethvin> much more important for repos that have jquery-release grabbing them
[06:56:20] <DaveMethvin> ok

[06:58:39] <m_gol> how to publish a beta tag without re-publishing 2.1.0?
[06:59:24] <m_gol> this time we need to update the beta manually
[06:59:59] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: not sure if we should put #14475 in the changelog
[07:00:07] <m_gol> it was open, then fixed, then changed to wontfix
[07:00:15] <m_gol> this local AJAX in IE in 2.x
[07:00:27] <DaveMethvin> oh good catch
[07:00:45] <m_gol> ah, it just has an incorrect resolution in trac
[07:00:53] <m_gol> I'll change to cantfix, ok?
[07:00:58] <DaveMethvin> wait
[07:01:01] <m_gol> ok
[07:01:06] <DaveMethvin> that was a different ticket? let me look
[07:02:06] <m_gol> ahh, sorry
[07:02:08] <m_gol> that's 1.x
[07:02:09] <m_gol> so it's ok
[07:02:11] <m_gol> my bad
[07:02:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah the other ticket was similar
[07:02:36] <m_gol> ok, no further remarks ;)
[07:03:21] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: you were thinking of http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14424
[07:03:34] <m_gol> yes, that :)
[07:04:33] <DaveMethvin> ok now to tweet
[07:10:18] <DaveMethvin> tweet complete, now for the CDNs
[07:10:59] <DaveMethvin> the checklist got shorter with jquery-release but there's still a lot of moving parts here
[07:13:46] <DaveMethvin> hmmmm, looks like http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js is still on 1.10.2
[07:14:32] <DaveMethvin> nope, just cached
[07:15:58] <DaveMethvin> ?reload fixed it
[07:20:54] <m_gol> hmm
[07:21:01] <m_gol> what is http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js?
[07:21:13] <m_gol> & how it relates to jquery-latest?
[07:21:16] <DaveMethvin> that is the latest version
[07:21:24] <DaveMethvin> same things
[07:21:28] <m_gol> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
[07:21:33] <m_gol> ok, so this one is not refreshed
[07:21:50] <DaveMethvin> well it was pushed, it just didn't get refreshed
[07:22:23] <DaveMethvin> kind of scary about the map, there is NOTHING that lets you know it's in sync with the min/src
[07:22:26] <DaveMethvin> not even a comment
[07:23:52] <m_gol> right
[07:23:56] <m_gol> but at least no default 404 ;)
[07:24:19] <m_gol> Is `npm publish --tag beta` enough on 2.1.0?
[07:24:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah who cares if it's right :)
[07:24:40] <DaveMethvin> don't ask me!
[07:26:10] <m_gol> nope, it doesn't work as the package is already published :/
[07:26:46] <DaveMethvin> must be some way to tag it retro
[07:27:07] <m_gol> google says mostly about publish --tag sth
[07:27:19] <m_gol> I hope it's not impossible :P
[07:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> npm tag jquery@2.1.0 beta
[07:28:02] <m_gol> ah, ok
[07:28:51] <m_gol> k, done
[07:29:32] <DaveMethvin> sweet!
[07:33:37] <timmywil> haha "Colin Snoverâ€™s commentary in #jquery-dev is also a source of rare humor for the team."
[07:33:45] <timmywil> <3 snover 
[07:34:18] <DaveMethvin> i tried to word that as ambiguously as possible :)
[07:47:26] <DaveMethvin> okay, all cdns contacted, emailed, uploaded to secret places, etc
[07:47:50] <DaveMethvin> this whole sourcemap thing makes it a pain
[07:48:41] <m_gol> I hope no CDN will add the sourcemap comment by itself :P
[07:49:25] <DaveMethvin> at least now all copies of jquery.js and jquery.min.js should checksum the same on all cdns, it's a start
[08:01:20] <m_gol> yes, that's concern number 2
[08:01:30] <m_gol> or maybe 1 if someone is serious about security there
[08:02:09] <DaveMethvin> as i've used the sourcemap stuff it's turned out to annoy me a lot
[08:02:21] <DaveMethvin> b/c it kind of magically shows you the unobfuscated code
[08:02:28] <DaveMethvin> but it doesn't know about variables
[08:02:40] <DaveMethvin> so it seems like dev tools are broken
[08:02:52] <DaveMethvin> there's no indication afaict that you are using a map
[08:03:13] <DaveMethvin> there needs to be some ui indication they are doing it
[08:05:49] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: and stack traces are not translated
[08:06:02] <m_gol> IMO source maps work for declarative languages
[08:06:13] <m_gol> especially if they're not natively supported by the browser
[08:06:34] <m_gol> I didn't have much trouble with Sass source maps for example
[08:06:39] <DaveMethvin> they can work for js as well, but to make it transparent you need a lot more info
[08:06:55] <DaveMethvin> and i dunno if i want to drag that over without a lot of advance notice
[08:07:05] <m_gol> sometimes minifiers optimize enough that it'd be even hard to fully reflect the code back to the unminified source
[08:07:29] <m_gol> I tried it on jQuery & in some loops debugger doesn't see all the steps, just i=lastvalue or sth like that
[08:07:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah, optimizations definitely can screw up the lines and vars
[08:07:54] <DaveMethvin> some vars may just disappear
[08:08:49] <DaveMethvin> a good format should handle the case of things getting *bigger* in the transformation as well, such as inline fn subtituion
[08:09:25] <m_gol> I can see that it's hard to get all that stuff right
[08:09:47] <m_gol> I generally just develop with unminified JS & test on production packages
[08:10:19] <DaveMethvin> i spend a lot of my time reverse engineering so i'm used to one-letter var names and just click the little brackets to break up the code :)
[08:10:52] <DaveMethvin> tbh the most confusing thing for me is looking at sites using various versions of jQuery and i'm thinking "wait, we fixed that!"
[08:11:15] <DaveMethvin> Amazon still uses a patched 1.2.6 in a lot of its site
[08:11:30] <DaveMethvin> wrapped by their own custom module loader and a lot of other junk
[08:11:53] <DaveMethvin> then they polyfill in stuff to make newer code work like jQuery.isArray
[08:11:59] <DaveMethvin> "newer"
[08:12:23] <DaveMethvin> since we only added isArray in 1.3!
[08:12:55] <m_gol> lol
[08:13:10] <m_gol> that's why I try as hard as possible to avoid patching vendor libraries
[08:13:15] <DaveMethvin> ok gotta walk the dog
[08:13:29] <m_gol> I added some info to the San Diego doc
[08:27:59] <snover> timmywil: :)

[09:19:23] <miketaylr> "Fewer forced layouts: In this release we declared war on places where we might inadvertently force the browser to do a time-consuming layout. We found a few and eliminated one in particular that could occur when changing class names."
[09:19:32] <miketaylr> anyone got a pointer to the bug or commit for that?
[09:19:44] <miketaylr> a) sounds awesome and b) just wanted to see what you guys did
[09:19:56] * miketaylr already grepped for layout in commits
[09:20:44] <DaveMethvin> huh, should have come up, let me find one
[09:20:55] <miketaylr> well, grep was generous
[09:20:59] <miketaylr> i just used github search
[09:21:08] <miketaylr> oh wait i actually have a tool for this
[09:21:12] <m_gol> miketaylr: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10814
[09:21:12] <snover> git log --grep?
[09:21:19] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14250
[09:21:32] <m_gol> there were a couple of this
[09:21:35] <miketaylr> awesome, thanks m_gol DaveMethvin
[09:21:45] <m_gol> I don't think we have all groupped under one container bug
[09:21:49] <DaveMethvin> that was also reported to Chrome as a bug, because they really shoudln't be forcing layout unless the className changes
[09:22:02] <miketaylr> snover: kind of https://github.com/miketaylr/commitgrep/blob/master/commitgrep.py
[09:22:03] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14164
[09:22:11] <miketaylr> (but it makes an html page w/ links to github)
[09:22:23] <DaveMethvin> the changes m_gol made to initialization got rid of some as well
[09:23:16] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: perhaps adding a link to the Chrome bug in http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14250 would be a good idea :)
[09:23:32] <DaveMethvin> let me find it in my twitter
[09:26:30] <DaveMethvin> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=278045
[09:28:23] <DaveMethvin> so miketaylr  we're still looking for situations where we might force layout, there are two that still happen but are kind of hard to avoid
[09:30:00] <miketaylr> oh funny that's a site i showed to paul and asked why the scrolling was so bad
[09:30:18] <DaveMethvin> NOW YOU KNOW
[09:46:18] <m_gol> what do other browsers do here?
[10:56:07] <timmywil> "you guys are sure going through these releases fast" wait. we are?
[11:29:19] <ryanneufeld> kborchers: yt?
