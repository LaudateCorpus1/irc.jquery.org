[20:29:34] <mavihs> Hi JohnResi, I'm trying to fix bug #554 of QUnit which is about exposing qunit version in API. I'm trying to do it the way it's done in jQuery. However there is no such equivalent object ofjQuery.fn in which I can add the version. What is the best way of doing it? Will exposing it in Qunit.config will make sense?
[20:29:47] <mavihs> JohnResig: ^
