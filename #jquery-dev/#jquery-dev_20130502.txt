[11:37:51] <johnkpaul> DaveMethvin:  gnarf asked me to send that to you. It's some work toward integrating sinon's fake timers into the jquery effects tests
[11:42:40] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: just wanted you to take a look at it and let us know if it's something john should keep moving forward with, i think this will make our effects tests run SO MUCH FASTER and be more reliable
[11:42:47] <gnarf> and we can actually test more accurately, etc
[11:43:09] <gnarf> do we really need to test "setInterval" in the browser, it seems this would be very stable
[11:44:32] <DaveMethvin> johnkpaul gnarf i see your point, and it would be great to put all these flakey timing issues to bed
[11:44:46] <DaveMethvin> let's give it a try
[11:45:13] <johnkpaul> cool
[11:45:22] <DaveMethvin> thanks johnkpaul!
[11:45:48] <gnarf> i figured since it was johnkpaul who showed me the way with sinon i'd ask him to tackle it ;)
[11:46:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah, the "no good idea goes unpunished" rule :D
[11:46:39] <johnkpaul> haha,  I'm glad to do it, excited to help with something that I have a little experience with
