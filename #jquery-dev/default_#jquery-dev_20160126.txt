[11:20:25] <chiragSoni> Hello again everyone!
[11:21:11] <chiragSoni> I have knowledge of html, css, javascript and jquery. I have now learned git and github also.
[11:21:36] <chiragSoni> I was browsing through the jquery repositories and issues.
[11:22:33] <chiragSoni> But i can't figure head or tail of the issue. I'm don't know how to start contributing
[11:22:58] <chiragSoni> Can anybody help? How to get yourself an bug assigned?
[11:25:43] <miketaylr> did you read https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md , chiragSoni?
[11:25:52] <chiragSoni> Yes
[11:26:04] <miketaylr> and https://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/ ?
[11:26:29] <chiragSoni> Yes
[11:28:30] <miketaylr> i'd recommend finding a bug you want to work on, making a patch, comment on the bug that you're working on it
[11:28:37] <miketaylr> then send a pull request for review when it's ready
[11:33:48] <chiragSoni> I have to look for a bug under issues tab, right? Because when I see there, many of the issues are declarative sentences like 'Deprecate jQuery.parseJSON' and others are already self-assigned.
