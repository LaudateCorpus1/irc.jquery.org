[08:08:04] <manus> Hey all! I just asked this in #jquery, so sorry for cross-reporting, but..
[08:08:13] <manus> It's a quick, hopefully easy question--how is the .has() method supposed to work? I've been using jQuery for quite a while but never really noticed or used .has. Read the API page and did some tests, and it seems possibly broken? Or maybe I'm doing something wrong.
[08:08:23] <manus> Example: $('<a 1></a><a 2><span></span></a><a 3></a>').filter('a').has('span')
[08:08:46] <manus> What's the expected result there? I get an empty jQuery object on 1.recent.
[08:09:05] <manus> on the other hand: $('<a 1></a><a 2><span></span></a><a 3></a>').filter('a:has(span)')
[08:09:17] <manus> ^ I get the expected result there
[08:09:29] <manus> i.e., a jQuery object containing the second <a> element
[08:09:45] <manus> Thoughts?
[08:11:07] <manus> Sorry if it's been reported/noabugged elsewhere, but it's a hard thing to search for. :]
[08:11:22] <manus> *notabugged
[08:15:04] <manus> same unexpected (to me) result with $('<div><a 1></a><a 2><span></span></a><a 3></a></div>').find('a').has('span')
[08:21:04] * manus hears crickets. spots a tumbleweed roll across the barren wasteland and into the forest. it collides into a tree. the crickets stop.
[08:23:07] * manus notices a chain-effect of trees falling... but does he hear them? or has he left upon realizing that he should probably just get back to work?
[08:24:13] <manus> Anywho, I don't remember my bugs.jquery creds.. if someone figures this is a bug, I'd appreciate if a response or the ticket link can be posted here, and I'll check the logs.
[08:30:00] <jzaefferer> markelog: regarding Karma - it can only execute the whole testsuite at once?
[08:30:50] <jzaefferer> markelog: I don't think TestSwarm splits the tests into modules for speed reasons. Its just more convenient to look at results for each module, instead of a giant huge list of tests and assertions for everything
[08:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> manus: I'm not seeing any problem: http://jsbin.com/ejIYeQAx/1/
[08:32:07] <_markelog> jzaefferer: we could do the same with karma, but travis output would be pretty big in that case
[08:32:26] <_markelog> we could workaround it though
[08:32:45] <_markelog> angular project does a similar thing
[08:32:56] <_markelog> but it looks awful
[08:33:03] <_markelog> code wise
[08:33:40] <_markelog> well, speed is a good enough reason too i guess :-)
[08:33:52] <manus> scott_gonzalez: strange, I copied the source for .has() from github, and it worked for me after that
[08:34:10] <manus> I even had a fiddle where it looked like it wasn't working
[08:34:25] <manus> ok, doing more testing
[08:35:35] <m_gol> _markelog: well, it's just a question of including proper test files, conceptually quite simple
[08:36:09] <m_gol> Angular has recently splitted their tests to a concurent unit & e2e runs
[08:36:14] <m_gol> but that's it
[08:42:52] <_markelog> m_gol: yes, as i said we could do this, but it would awful looking code
[08:43:18] <m_gol> yeah, I don't think it's necessary
[08:43:46] <_markelog> unfortunately, it might be
[08:44:17] <_markelog> btw m_gol, when you will become part of angular team?
[08:44:20] <_markelog> :-)
[08:44:36] <m_gol> _markelog: what makes you think so? :P
[08:45:12] <_markelog> i see you contribute a lot to that project
[08:45:36] <_markelog> 11 commits already
[08:46:03] <m_gol> lots of that is work-related, though not all ;)
[08:46:31] <m_gol> my jQuery involvement started with a bug in jQuery 2.0 data so it seems pretty standard for me :D
[08:46:52] <_markelog> right, same with me :-)
[08:47:20] <m_gol> secret plan by rwaldron :P
[08:54:39] <manus> scott_gonzalez: looks like I had just rediscovered http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11706
[09:16:12] <manus> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, I think I tried something funky with invalid markup in my fiddle, which is why I still got the error. So, user error. :] Thanks for looking into it, though.
[09:16:34] <manus> (user error + old jQuery)
[09:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> manus: no problem

[10:14:21] <_markelog> m_gol: any progress with timers?

[10:15:16] <_markelog> i think i fugure it out
[10:15:35] <_markelog> do you mind if i commit it?
[10:16:57] <m_gol> if you've already done it then sure :)
[10:17:23] <m_gol> or if you'll do it before I have a chance
[10:18:04] <_markelog> okay then
