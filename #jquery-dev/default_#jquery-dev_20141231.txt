[06:36:47] <gibson042> ?!?
[06:37:05] <gibson042> markelog: force-push _master_?
[06:37:22] <markelog> merged pull in the wrong branch
[06:37:31] <markelog> :((
[06:39:01] <markelog> it should be okay though, i dough someone pull in couple of seconds
[06:39:33] <gibson042> still, it's much preferred to just revert-commit
[06:39:50] <markelog> we did this before couple times
[06:39:54] <gibson042> we had some problems a couple of years ago
[06:40:10] <markelog> like?
[06:40:41] <gibson042> one of our own processes required a manual reset because it could no longer update properly
[06:40:55] <gibson042> I'm sure it's since been resolved, though
[06:41:30] <markelog> hm, how about we would force push only if couple of minutes pass, otherwise reverted
[06:41:49] <markelog> don't want to spoile the history if this stuff happen again
[06:44:47] <markelog> gibson042: ?
[06:44:48] <gibson042> I personally am extremely unlikely to ever force-push a releasable branch, especially master... breaking fast-forward on them makes me very uncomfortable

[06:45:30] <gibson042> I'd rather have some suboptimal history
[06:45:56] <markelog> gibson042: allrighty, if you are feeling that bad about it, then let's only revert from now on  
[06:47:23] <markelog> gibson042: we are fear potential problems here right? We don't have a real case now, when it would break something?
[06:47:51] <gibson042> right
[06:47:53] <gibson042> as far as I know, there are no remaining real problems from it
[06:48:25] <markelog> but let's be careful anyway, got it
[06:48:59] <markelog> btw, happy holidays Richard!
[06:49:04] <gibson042> you too!
