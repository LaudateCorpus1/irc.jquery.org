[13:46:04] <gnarf> dev team: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/167 /cc mikesherov DaveMethvin kswedberg
[13:46:05] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #167 on api.jquery.com (mblase75; 1d, 2h ago): toggle() animates if you provide a callback
[13:46:32] <kswedberg> gnarf: yeah, I saw that one. Seems like a bug?
[13:46:52] <gnarf> kswedberg: i'm inclined to call it a bug as well
[13:47:01] <gnarf> checking the units for it
[13:47:05] <gnarf> see if the case is covered
[13:47:14] <gnarf> so my thought really
[13:47:21] <kswedberg> or, actually, no.
[13:47:22] <gnarf> is that the "animation signature" (when you add a callback)
[13:47:27] <gnarf> wins
[13:47:31] <gnarf> so you get the default speed
[13:47:37] <kswedberg> yeah.
[13:47:56] <kswedberg> wow, .toggle() should be killed.
[13:48:00] <kswedberg> worst. method. ever.
[13:48:42] <DaveMethvin> oh....toggle
[13:48:52] <DaveMethvin> i'll be leaving now...
[13:48:59] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin. yeah, that. :p
[13:48:59] <gnarf> there are no unit tests covering that signature tho
[13:49:10] <gnarf> so, this is unwritten territory
[13:49:12] <DaveMethvin> maybe because it's undefined?
[13:49:37] <DaveMethvin> we'll be pulling .toggle(fn, fn...) out in 1.9
[13:49:37] <gnarf> basically, its interpreting it as .toggle( undefined, callback )
[13:49:50] <mikesherov> gnarf, yes
[13:49:53] <mikesherov> which is wrong
[13:50:06] <mikesherov> it's because we reversed the duck punches, right?
[13:50:06] <gnarf> actually
[13:50:10] <gnarf> you'd have to do that anyway
[13:50:20] <gnarf> because .toggle( callback ) should be an event
[13:50:25] <mikesherov> UGJH
[13:50:28] <DaveMethvin> WAT
[13:50:28] <b-ot> grr i just want that number that shows in the alert to be where the i is below it in the has
[13:50:37] <gnarf> this issue makes less sense now
[13:50:46] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:51:18] <DaveMethvin> for whatever reason the toggler only applies if there are 2 or more fns
[13:51:37] <gnarf> thats bad
[13:51:41] <DaveMethvin> so what should .toggle(fn)  do?
[13:51:43] <kswedberg> gnarf: I thought you needed to functions for .toggle() to be an event.
[13:51:50] <kswedberg> *two
[13:51:50] <gnarf> maybe it does
[13:51:57] <gnarf> i guess .click(fn)
[13:51:58] <gnarf> nvm
[13:52:07] <gnarf> .toggle(fn) is animation with undefined then
[13:52:10] <gnarf> thats what it is now
[13:52:14] <gnarf> apparently
[13:52:34] <kswedberg> yeah. it kind of makes sense in relation to other animation methods.
[13:52:56] <DaveMethvin> so we haven't documented .toggle(fn) to do anything, right?
[13:52:56] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/VJNQb/
[13:53:08] <kswedberg> nope
[13:53:12] <gnarf> we don't unit test .toggle( fn ) either
[13:53:23] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: no we haven't documented .toggle(fn)
[13:53:23] <DaveMethvin> which makes sense iff we haven't defined it
[13:53:32] <gnarf> true
[13:53:44] <DaveMethvin> so unless we're going to define a meaning  there isn't anything to do here
[13:53:45] <gnarf> seems like it is "animation with default speed" tho
[13:54:19] <gnarf> as far back as 1.6.4 at least :)
[13:54:39] <gnarf> is that what we want it to be?
[13:54:52] <DaveMethvin> so is someone proposing we define semantics for .toggle(fn)? if not it is undefined
[13:55:05] <DaveMethvin> and we have no action items here :D
[13:55:37] <gnarf> I think that the signature should be valid, as .hide( callback ), .show( callback ) do this as well, so does .fadeToggle( callback ) etc
[13:55:38] <DaveMethvin> we could always define semantics but i would not be for that unless they simplified the code
[13:56:00] <gnarf> they are all "animation with default speed"
[13:56:10] <kswedberg> gnarf: exactly.
[13:56:14] <gnarf> no code change needed
[13:56:19] <gnarf> just a test needs to be written
[13:56:24] <gnarf> and it needs to be documented
[13:56:27] <DaveMethvin> yay
[13:57:26] <DaveMethvin> oh that is probably why .toggle(fn,fn) had to take two fns
[13:57:31] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, also
[13:57:35] <gnarf> .click( fn )
[13:58:00] <kswedberg> Makes me feel yucky, but I think gnarf is right that it should be documented. :(
[13:58:10] <DaveMethvin> DAMMIT GNARF
[13:58:16] <DaveMethvin> you're right again
[13:58:21] <gnarf> sorry
[13:58:24] <gnarf> 2+2=5
[13:58:34] <DaveMethvin> ah that's more like it :D
[13:58:57] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin, gnarf: that isn't why .toggle(fn, fn) had to take two fns. It always had two functions because it was a "compound function" like .hover()
[13:59:22] <gnarf> kswedberg: it doesn't make sense as a "single function" anyway, you'd just use click :)
[13:59:38] <DaveMethvin> and .toggle(fn) makes sense as an animation? :)
[13:59:39] <kswedberg> right on, gnarf. (and .hover() only got the single-fn signature much later)
[14:00:21] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: No, but who said .toggle() had to make sense? If that were a requirement, we wouldn't have it at all. :)
[14:00:32] <DaveMethvin> hmm, i like the cut of your jib kswedberg
[14:00:42] <kswedberg> ?ts
[14:00:43] <bot-t> That's Sexualâ„¢
[14:00:52] <kswedberg> or â€¦ is it?
[14:01:15] <DaveMethvin> hot teen jibs ... yeah sounds liek it
[14:01:29] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: simluated click eventsâ€¦ is there something funky with them in IE8?
[14:01:39] <DaveMethvin> checkboxes?
[14:01:53] <DaveMethvin> or radios perhaps mikesherov
[14:01:55] <mikesherov> I ask because I'm crazy, but I'm trying to get jQuery UI's sortable test suite to pass in IE8
[14:02:35] <gnarf> hrm
[14:02:38] <mikesherov> change event on a link click?
[14:02:53] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: does that sound familiar
[14:03:00] <DaveMethvin> huh?
[14:03:01] <mikesherov> or maybe some tests in core you can point me too
[14:03:10] <DaveMethvin> where's your failing ui test?
[14:03:15] <mikesherov> nvm, click event on a link click
[14:03:43] <mikesherov> tests/unit/draggable/draggable_tickets.js
[14:03:44] <gnarf> wtb "test" type for trac :)
[14:03:48] <gnarf> i guess its a "feature"
[14:03:49] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12821
[14:03:58] <mikesherov> the one about 4752
[14:04:21] <mikesherov> gnarf: it's a feature
[14:05:43] <DaveMethvin> draggable_tickets.js ? mikesherov
[14:05:51] <mikesherov> yeah
[14:05:55] <mikesherov> um
[14:05:55] <mikesherov> no
[14:06:02] <mikesherov> sortable/sortable_tickets.js
[14:06:14] <mikesherov> Sorry, I'm going crazy from all the testing
[14:06:59] <DaveMethvin> ok it's using simulate
[14:07:08] <mikesherov> yeah, that's important info
[14:07:09] <DaveMethvin> which fires stuff with fireEvent on oldIE
[14:07:17] <mikesherov> which is not right>
[14:07:18] <mikesherov> ?
[14:07:23] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[14:07:26] <mikesherov> Oh, ha
[14:08:27] <DaveMethvin> i was going to run  the ui test locally but grunt complains in the lint  mikesherov
[14:08:43] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: it's a shitstorm
[14:08:48] <mikesherov> pull down my branch
[14:09:15] <DaveMethvin> what's the branch?
[14:09:17] <mikesherov> https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery-ui/tree/sortable_cleanup
[14:09:27] <mikesherov> that has where I'm at now
[14:09:37] <mikesherov> this is the last of the interaction cleanups
[14:10:03] <mikesherov> then it's on to an iron fisted denial of all pull requests that don't come with tests
[14:10:29] <DaveMethvin> clearly the hurricane has hardened your resolve mikesherov
[14:10:38] <mikesherov> HAHAAH
[14:11:05] <mikesherov> I just want UI to be at a point where it can demand and accept real contributions on the stuff that is slated for rewrite
[14:11:23] <mikesherov> and the only stuff that is acceptable (considering a rewrite) is bug patches, and those need tests
[14:11:33] <mikesherov> but need a sane test suite if you're going to demand tests
[14:13:23] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #472: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/472/
[14:13:24] <doesallmagic> richard.gibson: No ticket: fix effects test failure in IE6. Close gh-1012.
[14:13:57] <DaveMethvin> shut your whore mouth swarmy, gibson042 is a saint
[14:14:49] <DaveMethvin> i tellya there's something fishy bout browserstack lately
[14:15:14] <DaveMethvin> ok mikesherov got the sortable fails in unit tests
[14:15:29] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: They are effectively down
[14:15:31] <DaveMethvin> Died on test #3 undefined: 'undefined' is not an object
[14:15:40] <mikesherov> oh, hmmm
[14:15:43] <mikesherov> different than me
[14:15:45] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Though tests that do run should be fine
[14:15:52] <Krinkle> i.e. not browserstack but genuine IE bug.
[14:15:54] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: yeah as far as they go
[14:16:10] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1234
[14:16:28] <DaveMethvin> so Krinkle it looks like you fixed that ie6 fail, thanks
[14:16:29] <Krinkle> at least with the latest rewrite of testswarm-browserstack we won't be terminating/re-creating workers
[14:16:34] <Krinkle> Yep
[14:16:46] <Krinkle> I tested that through the browserstack GUI with secure tunnel
[14:17:11] <Krinkle> Currently there are 10 browser workers created but on status "queue" instead of "running"
[14:17:23] <Krinkle> Looks like their API cluster is overloaded or something. It takes like an hour for a worker to actually be booted.
[14:17:37] <Krinkle> I've sent an e-mail to them, CC on clarkbox and JÃ¶rn
[14:17:41] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: on IE8, the only fail I get is "17.2. click event should have fired."
[14:18:04] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: this was the headless testing that grunt did
[14:18:08] <DaveMethvin> maybe i have old stuff
[14:18:19] <DaveMethvin> let me run on ie8
[14:18:39] <mikesherov> yes, please
[14:18:41] <Krinkle> We do headless testing now on jquery core?
[14:18:47] <Krinkle> I thought we didn't do that yet.
[14:18:48] <Krinkle> Cool.
[14:18:52] <DaveMethvin> nnah,ui]
[14:18:58] <mikesherov> Krinkle: no, I'm off topic
[14:19:01] <Krinkle> k
[14:19:05] <mikesherov> asking for help on UI
[14:19:34] <Krinkle> I'd like one jquery-dev channel, but since people apparantly like it scattered, I got used to it.
[14:20:22] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i'm getting several fails in chrome onhttp://localhost/jquery-ui/tests/unit/sortable/sortable.html
[14:20:26] <DaveMethvin> is that right?
[14:20:33] <mikesherov> no
[14:20:45] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: yay, I got 1234 :D
[14:20:50] <DaveMethvin> http://wnd8.com/grab/a70c28.png
[14:20:58] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: ^
[14:21:24] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you sure you have my branched checked out?
[14:21:36] <DaveMethvin> lemme double check
[14:22:59] <mikesherov> so weird, everything passing for me, including on grunt
[14:23:11] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: well something went wrong http://wnd8.com/grab/a19102.png
[14:23:30] <DaveMethvin> could be a Windows thing
[14:23:42] <mikesherov> yeah, the undefined thing is a known issue in grunt, believe it or not
[14:23:44] <mikesherov> I think?
[14:23:50] <DaveMethvin> foh
[14:23:55] <DaveMethvin> d'oh
[14:24:13] <DaveMethvin> alrighty then
[14:24:23] <DaveMethvin> so, what should I do to clean up?
[14:24:30] <mikesherov> run grunt again?
[14:24:35] <DaveMethvin> sure!
[14:24:57] <mikesherov> I mean, technically, if you checked out my branch, I'm getting no qunit fails via grunt/phantom and passing in chrome
[14:25:06] <DaveMethvin> just to be sure, i'm still getting a LOT of lint errors ... right?
[14:25:11] <mikesherov> I have the same fail you have though on IE8
[14:25:16] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: no
[14:25:24] <mikesherov> should be clean with my branch
[14:25:29] <mikesherov> git log plase
[14:25:31] <mikesherov> please*
[14:25:43] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: npm install
[14:25:54] <mikesherov> git show: commit d43f5de885ee9915bd96cda30ee88d65d31fc37b
[14:25:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah let me start from scratch on that
[14:25:59] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you're on an old grunt / jshint i think
[14:26:03] <mikesherov> great
[14:26:03] <DaveMethvin> bc your comit is on the top
[14:26:20] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i just ran into similar issue, and i needed to npm install
[14:26:27] <gnarf> (lint errors)
[14:26:33] <DaveMethvin> oh good
[14:26:57] <DaveMethvin> damn this project has never met a dependency it didn't like
[14:27:41] <DaveMethvin> ok this time I  definitely DID run into a Windows thing, >> CreateProcessW: The system cannot find the file specified.
[14:28:05] <DaveMethvin> during the htmllint:all
[14:28:18] <gnarf> um
[14:29:23] <mikesherov> ok, so skip htmllint
[14:29:29] <mikesherov> that has a JAVA dep I think
[14:29:56] <mikesherov> thanks so much for helping me
[14:30:15] <DaveMethvin> i think it may be grunt.file.expand, but yeah it's "only" lint
[14:31:31] <DaveMethvin> nope, same fails in the headless
[14:31:36] <DaveMethvin> and same chrome fails
[14:31:42] <mikesherov> weird
[14:32:01] <mikesherov> well
[14:32:15] <mikesherov> and you have d43f5de885ee9915bd96cda30ee88d65d31fc37b as your head?
[14:32:25] <mikesherov> thanks anyway DaveMethvin
[14:32:37] <DaveMethvin> yep mikesherov that's my head
[14:32:44] <DaveMethvin> dunno what is up
[14:33:03] <mikesherov> K, well, that's disconcerting. Are you on release or canary?
[14:33:13] <DaveMethvin> release for chrome
[14:33:31] <DaveMethvin> lemme test in ie8 for giggles
[14:33:34] <mikesherov> maybe it's timing?
[14:34:00] <DaveMethvin> in ie8 i just get the one fail, "click event should have fired"
[14:34:09] <mikesherov> Right, that's the fail I'm trying to fix
[14:34:59] <DaveMethvin> the chrome fails are  http://localhost/jquery-ui/tests/unit/sortable/sortable_events.js:157:3: Cannot read property 'helper' of undefined
[14:35:58] <mikesherov> that is so weird
[14:36:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah considering that's the end of the file
[14:36:47] <DaveMethvin> but i assme the final "update" test failed
[14:36:56] <DaveMethvin> so it never called the fn setting hash=ui
[14:37:17] <DaveMethvin> brb
[14:41:43] <DaveMethvin> back
[14:41:52] <mikesherov> k, so I think it's a timing issue
[14:41:55] <mikesherov> which is weird
[14:42:21] <DaveMethvin> well if update happens async i could see how that could happen
[14:42:31] <DaveMethvin> you could use a deferred
[14:43:27] <mikesherov> ugh
[14:43:39] <mikesherov> This stupid test uses live even

[18:49:07] <paulbr> Hey guys, I'm trying to get started contributing to jQuery.  I've read the existing guides, but I'm still just trying to get a handle on the process of selecting what I should work on in the issue tracker.

[21:44:23] <Krinkle> swarm is doing fine, browserstack api is having issuues
[21:44:33] <Krinkle> still is
[21:44:46] <Krinkle> the core build passed because I was logged on the gui and started them manually
[21:45:00] <Krinkle> (needed to know if effects was passing in IE6 or not)
[21:45:28] <Krinkle> But browserstack is slowly coming back, Chrome and Firefox workers were started by the API last run, not by me
[21:45:38] <Krinkle> maybe upcoming build will do it on its own completely within time
[21:45:40] <Krinkle> lets hope so :)
[21:46:00] <gibson042> you're a good man, Krinkle
[21:46:12] <Krinkle> Thanks gibson042
[21:46:31] <Krinkle> gibson042: It was really nice meeting you in DC. Looking forward to hack together some time soon :D
[21:47:00] <gibson042> definitely
