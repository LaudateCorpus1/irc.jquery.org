[10:56:15] <danheberden> kswedberg not sure - though someone's been trying to get into the box
[10:56:54] <kswedberg> huh. h4x0rs
[10:57:38] <danheberden> haha
[10:57:41] <danheberden> from india!
[10:58:37] <kswedberg> great.
[11:24:30] <Cokegod> is it true that jQuery 2.0 might drop support for IE 6-8?
[11:27:32] <ajpiano> it was just mentioned in a meeting today
[11:28:16] <ajpiano> http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery-meeting/%23jquery-meeting_20120123.log.html
[11:29:08] <DaveMethvin> it's just brainstorming
[11:29:19] <DaveMethvin> so don't get excited Cokegod ajpiano
[11:29:25] <rwaldron> uh oh
[11:29:33] <ajpiano> yeah i am not excited, just curious why addyosmani_ tweeted it :x
[11:29:35] <rwaldron> Next thing it will be on HN
[11:29:42] <DaveMethvin> addyosmani_: !
[11:29:45] <rwaldron> wtf
[12:50:31] <DaveMethvin> hey addyosmani_: DM seems to be broken on twitter atm ... anyway np, it's just that we're too early in planning to say anything definitive
[13:15:05] <JohnResi1> what's this I hear about 2.0 not having IE 6-8 support?
[13:20:44] <timmywil> JohnResig: it was just something dave suggested. I say no
[13:20:58] <timmywil> then addy tweeted so like 30,000 people saw it ;)
[13:21:35] <danheberden> proof that putting *might* in your tweets means jack shit
[13:21:46] <DaveMethvin> lol it's everywhere
[13:22:08] <DaveMethvin> well i tweeted back saying he was jumpng the gun
[13:22:25] <DaveMethvin> and again i think it depends on when 2.0 comes out and whether 1.x is still around
[13:22:31] <DaveMethvin> we don't have a ship date for 1.8 yet
[13:22:47] <DaveMethvin> but i think it's safe to say we don't put out three major-point versions this year
[13:23:01] <JohnResig> yeah, that's probably a safe bet
[13:23:06] <tbranyen> jaubourg: yo man, is there any way to get the options back out of a jqXHR?
[13:23:11] <JohnResig> a spring, a fall, and probably one early next year
[13:23:19] <danheberden> tbranyen there's original options and options
[13:23:19] <DaveMethvin> 60% of ppl are still on 1.4.x or earlier
[13:23:27] <tbranyen> var jqxhr = $.ajax(options); jqxhr.?
[13:23:29] <danheberden> inspect it, you'll see it there tbranyen
[13:23:32] <tbranyen> nope i don't
[13:23:35] * danheberden looks
[13:23:43] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: fyi, i've cleaned up the sizzle issues and prs https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues
[13:23:43] <danheberden> oh, sorry tbranyen
[13:23:45] <tbranyen> i'm on 1.6.4
[13:23:48] <tbranyen> maybe its in on 1.7
[13:23:49] <danheberden> tbranyen: one sec
[13:23:52] <danheberden> i got just the thing for you!
[13:24:02] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i saw, thanks!
[13:24:42] <timmywil> I'm not an admin. Is there a way to make it so that people can't change the labels themselves?
[13:24:55] <DaveMethvin> you mean the issue labels?
[13:25:02] <DaveMethvin> i didn't think they could
[13:25:07] <timmywil> yea, one guy added blocker when it is not a blocker
[13:25:45] <DaveMethvin> looking now
[13:26:07] <DaveMethvin> oh i wonder if it's on a whole-project basis timmywil
[13:26:14] <DaveMethvin> who added the blocker?
[13:26:31] <timmywil> whoever had this one https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/5
[13:26:32] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #5 on sizzle, reported by cgriego (2y, 1m ago): Proprietary selectors should use a vendor prefix
[13:26:42] <timmywil> from 2009 lol
[13:26:45] <danheberden> tbranyen http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/qnFQf/
[13:27:12] <timmywil> you know, maybe I did that and I didn't realize it
[13:27:20] <tbranyen> ah dope this might be exactly what i need
[13:27:21] <tbranyen> thanks danheberden
[13:27:26] <danheberden> tbranyen np :)
[13:28:13] <tbranyen> ah shit can't attach this to a specific request... hrm
[13:28:35] <tbranyen> i think i can figure this out, thx for the tip
[13:29:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: could have been me, don't fret too much
[13:30:03] <tbranyen> haha sexy this is great
[13:30:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah timmywil i know i've been unable to change tags on other projects,
[13:30:43] <DaveMethvin> so it would seem odd
[13:33:15] <timmywil> cool, 15 is nicer than 42
[14:01:41] <Jayflux> I also joined this chan because I'm hearing on twitter support droping for ie 6 & 7?
[14:04:25] <tbranyen> how would you guys handle the case when you aren't sure if you have already set a prefilter or not?
[14:04:32] <tbranyen> is setting a flag on jQuery namespace a no-no here?
[14:04:37] <tbranyen> shame you can't name them
[14:04:56] <tbranyen> actually i'll bring this to #jquery
[15:21:50] <jaubourg> tbranyen: no but you can make a prefilter to do it
[15:22:17] <tbranyen> jaubourg: ya ended up doing that
[15:22:25] <tbranyen> any thoughts on if that should be available by default?
[15:23:09] <jaubourg> given it's a one-liner and not that useful in the field, I'd say no ;)
[15:23:24] <jaubourg> but I may underestimate the usefulness ?
[15:23:27] <jaubourg> and hi :)
[15:23:34] <tbranyen> sup :D
[15:23:38] <tbranyen> yeah the prefilter was easy enough
[15:23:56] <tbranyen> basically you pass options into Backbone.sync and he does a whole lot of magic, and then you get the jqXHR back but no idea as to what the options are now
[15:24:01] <jaubourg> good good, just too much work and too much social activity for my own good
[15:24:40] <jaubourg> heh, I hear you... I dunno, backbone.sync can add a prefilter to handle this I guess
[15:34:32] <addyosmani_> My new year's resolution is to avoid tweeting about anything discussed in -meeting.
[15:35:02] <addyosmani_> No one read the *might* part about the IE6-8 plugin idea.
[15:37:21] <addyosmani_> anyway..sorry all. Poor judgement on my part regardless.
[17:38:11] <bassheadx> so I am trying to install the plugin site and I am having problems with node. stuck on the second to last step. node src/update.js      This expects a post-receive hook as stdin. You can use {"repository":{"url":"http://github.com/scottgonzalez/temp-jquery-foo","watchers":3,"forks":25}} for testing.
