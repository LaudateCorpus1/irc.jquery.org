[07:12:44] <vaibhav_gupta> hey I was building jquery and got an error in jslint-check.js
[07:12:53] <vaibhav_gupta> TypeError: Cannot read property 'reason' of null
[07:14:57] <vaibhav_gupta> is it an issue?
[08:15:34] <mikesherov> for the love of god
[09:06:29] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yt?
[09:06:57] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: yep!
[09:07:00] <mikesherov> several things: 1. we need a resolution of "ported" or something similar for when we move to api.jquery.com tracker
[09:07:11] <mikesherov> feels wrong closing as invalid, etc.
[09:07:26] <DaveMethvin> i was gonna change invalid to notabug
[09:07:28] <mikesherov> second, we should probably change "invalid" to "notabug"
[09:07:31] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:07:31] <mikesherov> woah
[09:07:33] <mikesherov> jinx
[09:07:49] <DaveMethvin> mind reading is hard
[09:07:59] <mikesherov> 3. why can't you let the window.height() ticket die???
[09:08:12] <DaveMethvin> it was set to new
[09:08:16] <DaveMethvin> i made it pending
[09:08:25] <DaveMethvin> so it will die in its own time
[09:09:12] <mikesherov> but wikinaut keeps setting it back to new
[09:09:18] <mikesherov> it's cruel
[09:09:24] <DaveMethvin> oh, by replying
[09:09:43] <DaveMethvin> well if he does it again without a test case let's just close it invalid, er, notabug
[09:09:44] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:09:47] <mikesherov> K
[09:10:10] <mikesherov> so when I port things over to api.jquery.com tracker, I close as "notabug"? Seems weird
[09:10:20] <DaveMethvin> well, it's not a CODE bug
[09:10:30] <DaveMethvin> same with problems with a plugin, it's not OUR bug
[09:10:31] <DaveMethvin> it's a bug
[09:10:36] <DaveMethvin> but not our bug
[09:10:47] <DaveMethvin> notabug just seems friendlier
[09:11:09] <DaveMethvin> we definitely have a backlog of docs cleanups to do
[09:11:28] <mikesherov> sure, I just want to close as "moved"
[09:11:30] <mikesherov> or something
[09:11:34] <mikesherov> but que sera
[09:11:42] <mikesherov> it's fine
[09:11:45] <mikesherov> no reason to add another resolution I guess
[09:11:48] <DaveMethvin> well why not move ui or plugin bugs then?
[09:12:12] <mikesherov> hm?
[09:12:28] <DaveMethvin> i don't think there's a clean way to just move it
[09:12:32] <mikesherov> sure
[09:12:52] <DaveMethvin> oh and i wanted to combine feature/enhancement too
[09:12:56] <mikesherov> me too
[09:13:01] <mikesherov> here's an example: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12353
[09:13:18] <mikesherov> I responded that I remade the ticket in the right place
[09:13:31] <mikesherov> I wanted to close as "moved" or something
[09:13:41] <DaveMethvin> i would be fine with notabug, because it's not a bug and we're clarifying the docs
[09:13:43] <mikesherov> I suppose notabug works though!
[09:13:48] <mikesherov> fair enough
[09:13:52] <mikesherov> motion withdrawn
[09:13:52] <DaveMethvin> invalid just seems antisocial
[09:14:00] <mikesherov> YOUR ARGUMENT IS INVALID
[09:14:04] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:14:25] <DaveMethvin> thanks for taking care of all those tickets this morning
[09:14:54] <DaveMethvin> i need to go through the PRs, unfortunately are are accumulating 1.9 requests
[09:15:04] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking of tagging those
[09:15:17] <DaveMethvin> just to help keep them straight
[09:21:02] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:21:05] <mikesherov> No problem
[09:21:17] <mikesherov> I want to keep the reports manageable
[09:21:29] <mikesherov> I had been meaning to do a ruthless cleanup all week
[09:21:35] <mikesherov> just couldn't find the time
[09:23:18] <mikesherov> there it is! notabug
[09:25:52] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[09:28:47] <mikesherov> am I reading this wrong: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12363
[09:28:56] <mikesherov> How would that ever even work?
[09:30:02] <DaveMethvin> looking...
[09:31:11] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: all guessing of course...
[09:31:15] <DaveMethvin> but what i think is happening
[09:31:21] <DaveMethvin> is that the response is html
[09:31:24] <DaveMethvin> it's put into a <div>
[09:31:47] <DaveMethvin> since a body can't go into a div, the top level item the `data` ends up being the div with the id
[09:31:55] <mikesherov> but he's clearly just using it wrong
[09:31:56] <DaveMethvin> so .find() can't find it beneath itself
[09:32:02] <mikesherov> ohhhhh
[09:32:04] <mikesherov> right
[09:32:08] <mikesherov> that's funny
[09:32:26] <DaveMethvin> the docs are pretty clear about how html this way is flakey
[09:32:42] <DaveMethvin> and i absolutely dislike using this approach anyway
[09:32:51] <DaveMethvin> since you send markup from the server
[09:32:58] <DaveMethvin> great idea circa 2006
[09:33:02] <DaveMethvin> not great today
[09:33:38] <DaveMethvin> i'll reply
[09:34:12] <mikesherov> Oh, I did already saying to get help on the forums
[09:34:23] <mikesherov> but you can chime in to if you'd like
[09:34:38] <mikesherov> Thanks for contributing! Please ask for further help on the forums or stackoverflow, but you're using the jquery function incorrectly. It just happened to work weirdly enough. What you should be doing, assuming that data is some html is:
[09:34:39] <mikesherov> $.ajax({
[09:34:40] <mikesherov>   url: "/this_same_page.jsp",
[09:34:42] <mikesherov>   success: function(data) {
[09:34:43] <mikesherov>     $("#id_of_the_part_i_wanna_update").html(data);
[09:34:44] <mikesherov>   }
[09:34:45] <mikesherov> });
[09:34:46] <mikesherov> If you need further help, ask for it on the forums! Thanks!
[09:35:44] <DaveMethvin> ok cool!
[09:36:33] <DaveMethvin> that notabug makes me feel better already
[09:36:35] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12441this one is about when you disconnect a "visible" element from the dom, and then call toggle on it, and then reappend, it's still visible
[09:36:39] <DaveMethvin> i reorderd the resolutions too
[09:36:44] <mikesherov> yeah, I noticed
[09:36:47] <mikesherov> keep me on my toes
[09:37:13] <mikesherov> so, that ticket is not really a bug, because when you detach an element, you're making it "hidden"
[09:37:14] <DaveMethvin> those kind of things make me sad
[09:37:18] <DaveMethvin> it's like
[09:37:25] <mikesherov> and then you toggle, and it's visible
[09:37:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah, which seems reasonable
[09:37:40] <mikesherov> it's like he heard about this great optimization
[09:37:53] <mikesherov> "make all your dom changes on detached fragments to avoid reflow"
[09:38:01] <mikesherov> and then, boom
[09:38:18] <mikesherov> even thought that optimization is rarely true anymore
[09:38:35] <mikesherov> unless the changes significantly impact layout over and over again
[09:38:50] <mikesherov> OK, I'm going to close as won't fix
[09:39:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah it seems like our current impl is okay
[09:39:26] <mikesherov> k
[09:39:47] <DaveMethvin> if it's not in a doc i don't see how you could even ensure that it would be visible if you put it in a document and there was css that applied
[09:39:59] <DaveMethvin> the question is wrong in the first place
[09:40:55] <DaveMethvin> actually i think notabug is more appropriate there, thinking about it mikesherov
[09:41:06] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:41:08] <DaveMethvin> but as long as it's closed :D
[09:41:46] <mikesherov> I wonder if we should update our docs to say that toggle wont ever hide detached elements?
[09:41:51] <mikesherov> I'll add needsdocs though.
[09:41:54] <DaveMethvin> his expectation is that a detached tree will maintain a memory of the css in the document where it lived
[09:42:45] <mikesherov> which it does not
[09:42:55] <mikesherov> in chrome specifically, it's like, go screw yourself
[09:43:37] <mikesherov> OK, well, there goes a lot of ticketsâ€¦ almost through the list
[09:46:29] <DaveMethvin> damn, i forgot that github doesn't let you have tags unless you have enabled issues on a repo ... SUCKS!
[09:46:46] <DaveMethvin> every few months i have to re-discover that
[09:47:16] <DaveMethvin> ?tell DaveMethvin github doesn't let you have tags unless you have enabled issues on a repo (in 6 months)
[09:47:17] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, Okay.
[09:52:38] <mikesherov> LOL
[09:52:50] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I'm able to repro this guys issue: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12374
[09:54:05] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[09:54:06] <bot-t> (6 mins 49 secs ago) <DaveMethvin> tell DaveMethvin github doesn't let you have tags unless you have enabled issues on a repo (in 6 months)
[09:54:11] <mikesherov> in chrome, when I try to resize up and left it stops if I go too fast, as if something on the IFRAME content is cancelling the drag event
[09:54:50] <mikesherov> Aside from the broken english, I think this guy has something
[09:55:16] <DaveMethvin> i can't repro
[09:55:33] <DaveMethvin> so you're grabbing the resizer with the mouse and moving it up and left?
[09:55:59] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:56:13] <DaveMethvin> seems really smooth to me
[09:56:26] <DaveMethvin> try running incognito, maybe its a plugin?
[09:56:27] <mikesherov> in your version, it's buggy
[09:56:33] <mikesherov> in his version, not buggy
[09:57:11] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, now i see it mikesherov
[09:57:13] <DaveMethvin> in my version
[09:57:30] <sizcommit> [sizzle] timmywil pushed 7 new commits to master: http://git.io/J5Rn5g

[09:57:48] <mikesherov> right, he was showing how it's awesome in 1.4.2
[09:58:01] <mikesherov> timmywil: awesome
[09:58:25] <DaveMethvin> well it seems to work in 1.7.2 as well for me, did it for you mikesherov
[09:59:05] <mikesherov> 1.7.2 with what version of ui?
[09:59:21] <mikesherov> fiddle please?
[10:00:21] <DaveMethvin> oh that WAS 1.4.2 nevermind
[10:00:32] <DaveMethvin> not 1.7.2
[10:00:35] <mikesherov> right
[10:00:50] <mikesherov> so, mark as open?
[10:01:04] <mikesherov> heck, I'll assign it to you
[10:01:07] <DaveMethvin> sure
[10:01:39] <DaveMethvin> there is no way any browser but oldIE should need event.returnValue set
[10:02:12] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, i think i remember a bug from waaaay back about this
[10:02:24] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez impressed me with his git bisect skilllz
[10:02:43] <DaveMethvin> and we found that some browser was dying when event.returnValue was set
[10:02:46] <DaveMethvin> that wasn't oldIE
[10:02:52] <DaveMethvin> lemme see if i can find that commit

[10:06:46] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Update Sizzle: adds custom performance suite for testing across multiple selector engines and multiple versions of Sizzle - Timmy Willison
[10:06:55] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: HOW SLOW IS IT?
[10:08:17] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: so slow the "Chariots of Fire" theme song plays when it makes selections
[10:08:27] <DaveMethvin> ZING!
[10:08:37] <DaveMethvin> you didn't let me down timmywil
[10:08:43] <timmywil> :)
[10:08:58] <DaveMethvin> now that song is in my  head
[10:09:05] <timmywil> lol
[10:11:14] <timmywil> here's a shock: Sizzle is generally the fastest at pseudos
[10:12:11] <timmywil> dojo is slower than I thought
[10:12:31] <timmywil> Slick is freaking fast at everything but pseudos
[10:12:56] <timmywil> nwmatcher is okay at everything exception nth-child
[10:13:09] <timmywil> qwery sucks at everything except ID selectors
[10:13:17] <timmywil> and usually returns wrong results
[10:13:20] <DaveMethvin> haha
[10:13:38] <DaveMethvin> well nothing helps correctness like getting 100,000 web sites to use your code
[10:13:43] <timmywil> and sizzle pre 1.8 is slow
[10:14:31] <timmywil> although I need to speed up Sizzle 1.8+ for comma selectors
[10:14:52] <DaveMethvin> that's a tough one
[10:15:59] <timmywil> sort of, I think doing each selector separately and sorting afterwards will be the fastest way to go. slick does this well.
[10:16:34] <timmywil> nwmatcher is also slow for comma selectors, so it seems to be the downside of a purely bottom-up strategy
[10:17:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's not a good case for bottom-up esp if you want document order
[10:17:36] <DaveMethvin> but hey, as long as it's not horribly slow
[10:17:52] <timmywil> well, that's the kicker. nwmatcher and Sizzle preserve document order by starting with '*'
[10:18:14] <timmywil> just comma selectors that is
[10:19:43] <timmywil> single selectors can have a piece split off to reduce the original set. e.g. tag:pseudo reduces the set to gEBTN('tag'). Doing that for each part and sorting seems to be faster than checking all elements on the page and not sorting.
[10:21:33] <timmywil> I'm very impressed by slick now
[10:22:49] <DaveMethvin> funny how once you've had to do it yourself you get a lot more respect for the others, eh?
[10:23:17] <DaveMethvin> i had great fun stepping thru sizzle a few weeks back with some cases

[10:29:45] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: http://cl.ly/image/433N442p2d3U  that green is the ID selector :P
[10:30:09] <timmywil> yellow means different returned elements, but most of those yellow are also red
