[05:15:28] <mixonic> howdy jquery-dev
[05:15:59] <mixonic> Iâ€™m trying to author a commit for qunit, but Iâ€™m getting a message that the first line (subject) must indicate a component
[05:16:20] <mixonic> Iâ€™m not sure what component I should be indicating of what the syntax is, can you point me in the right direction?
[05:16:52] <m_gol> mixonic: did you read http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/?
[05:17:13] <mixonic> I read like 5 things, never made it to that :-(
[05:17:14] <mixonic> reading
[05:18:42] <mixonic> thanks m_gol, just what I needed.
[05:24:22] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15mixonic opened pull request #578: jsDump: Add a depth parameter to object parsing (06master...06shallow) 02http://git.io/M2w9IA
[06:56:28] <scott_gonzalez> leobalter: Why a migrate script instead of a script that actually migrates the code?
[06:57:16] <scott_gonzalez> QUnit's API is super tiny and the changes are straight forward.

[07:39:28] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz uGoMobi: Are you ok with me closing all new features for TR as "won't fix, wait for the new CSS framework"?
[07:39:56] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i am
[07:40:10] <arschmitz> iv already been saying no to them all with that answer anyway
[07:40:29] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so any old or new ones yeah go ahead i think
[07:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> great
[07:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the joy of closing a 3 year old PR from a team member...
[07:45:37] <arschmitz> oh thats an old one predates me
[07:45:39] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: thanks for closing those
[07:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> Can one of you look at https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com/pull/192
[07:47:12] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: done
[07:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[07:48:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i'm leaving for about an hour if you need anything else ill do it as soon as i get back
[08:31:21] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: ping
[08:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> pong
[08:32:00] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: you created 2 separate commits for normalizing LF in the infra repo, one for puppet-stage & one for puppet-master
[08:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:32:44] <m_gol> they need to point to the same one ;)
[08:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't do that.
[08:34:07] <scott_gonzalez> For the same reason I couldn't merge https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/305
[08:35:15] <m_gol> not really - you can do `git reset --hard another_branch`
[08:35:37] <m_gol> another_branch can even be a remote one
[08:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. Still had local changes.
[08:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin|away can confirm that I tried everything I could think of and nothing worked.
[08:36:24] <m_gol> how so? if you fixed it on one branch and did a hard reset to it, what changes did you see? :/
[08:36:53] <scott_gonzalez> You mean commit to puppet-master, then reset puppet-stage to that?
[08:37:01] <m_gol> yes
[08:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> I guess. You can still do that if it really matters.
[08:39:37] <m_gol> done
[08:39:42] <m_gol> it was either that or a merge commit
[08:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> The setup for the infrastructure repo is just weird.
[08:40:54] <scott_gonzalez> puppet-stage should be the main branch.
[08:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> That would've avoided the problem altogether.
[09:30:16] <leobalter> scott_gonzalez: about the migrate script, it's personal limitation. I don't know how to do it, maybe it's easy but I have no experience
[10:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> leobalter: Hmm...I guess this will actually be pretty hard without a CST.
