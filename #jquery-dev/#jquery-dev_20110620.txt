[05:18:35] <gnarf> okay, so i really don't like it when people post IE error messages in other languages
[05:18:42] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/416 :)
[06:01:15] <timmywil> .
[06:34:58] <rwaldron> how did we pass http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9385 to 1.7 roadmap?
[06:35:05] <rwaldron> with 5 down votes and 2 upvotes
[06:35:44] <timmywil> did it pass?
[06:36:02] <rwaldron> it has a green box and says "yes, with stern warnings"
[06:36:36] <ajpiano> rwaldron: my skills of argumentation
[06:36:43] <timmywil> wasn't that just somebody's comment?
[06:36:53] <rwaldron> timmywil someone just commented it on
[06:36:59] <rwaldron> which is what made me look
[06:37:19] <rwaldron> i immediately thought... how come i didnt close that when i closed all the rejected proposals
[06:37:28] <rwaldron> so i went back to look
[06:37:34] <rwaldron> and it was green
[06:37:45] <rwaldron> ajpiano thanks for clarifying
[06:37:51] <ajpiano> :)
[06:37:52] <timmywil> ah, right, close now?
[06:38:03] <rwaldron> I didnt bring it up because I wanted to be mad about it, FYI
[06:38:09] <rwaldron> i just didn't remember
[06:38:18] <ajpiano> timmywil, no, we agreed we were actualyl going to do it, iirc.
[06:38:19] <rwaldron> timmywil no
[06:38:29] <rwaldron> it still needs to be patched/landed
[06:38:57] <timmywil> i must have missed that
[06:40:25] <timmywil> rwaldron: where's that roadmap you're looking at
[06:40:43] <rwaldron> google docs
[07:20:30] <timmywil> heh @ docs#9619
[07:20:31] <bot-t> [#9619] toLowerCase (pending bug) - http://jqbug.com/9619

[09:59:39] <ben_alman> i just added the july 11-12 bug triage dates to my calendar!
[10:03:51] <timmywil> hmm? dates were set?
[10:09:28] <ben_alman> well, i see them in our calendar
[10:09:36] <ben_alman> it would be good to have them verified
[10:09:38] <ben_alman> just to make sure
[10:09:45] <timmywil> we have a calendar? :P
[10:09:52] <ben_alman> our = bocoup
[10:09:57] <timmywil> ah
[10:09:59] <timmywil> right
[10:10:05] <ben_alman> ajpiano, do you know if the bug triage thing is in fact july 11-12 ?
[10:10:47] <timmywil> brb
[10:13:05] <ajpiano> ben_alman: yes, it is now then.

[10:20:20] <ben_alman> awesomne.
[12:06:21] <gnarf> louisremi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/416#r48365
[12:08:21] <louisremi> gnarf, oh... have you tested both setting it to "" (empty string) or null?
[12:08:27] <gnarf> ummm
[12:08:29] <gnarf> not null
[12:08:33] <gnarf> lemme try quick
[12:08:45] <gnarf> empty string, "" or " " both leave the cleartype there
[12:08:54] <louisremi> ok, good to know
[12:09:09] <gnarf> i tried delete style.filter but that jsut blew up :)
[12:09:25] <louisremi> :D
[12:13:19] <gnarf> louisremi: style.filter = null results in "FILTER: null" in the cssText, which still disables cleartype
[12:13:27] <louisremi> alright
[12:14:05] <gnarf> yeah i tried a bunch of shit
[12:14:07] <louisremi> gnarf: would you mind adding your findings in the comments? This might help other library authors.
[12:14:11] <gnarf> but not null ;)
[12:14:29] <gnarf> code comments / bug comments ?
[12:14:38] <louisremi> (and curious ppl like me to understand the code)
[12:14:43] <louisremi> code comments
[12:15:02] <louisremi> if it fits in one line
[12:15:16] <louisremi> otherwise in the bug comment
[12:19:15] <gnarf> eh, i think i got it reduced to two lines
[12:19:30] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/1O2X3a3t420p1O3M0J2j
[12:21:28] <gnarf> im just gonna push amended
[12:28:02] <timmywil> nice gnarf
[12:29:16] <gnarf> eh, it seems ugly as hell to me
[12:29:29] <gnarf> but working ugly is better than broken cute
[12:29:51] <gnarf> i kinda agree with jaubourg on this one now
[12:30:08] <gnarf> that the flip back to working cleartext might look worse than not having cleartext :)
[16:27:16] <jaubourg> ben_alman: you around?
[16:29:52] <jaubourg> ?tell ben_alman: got hooked up in work and didn't realize I had a training to give next week... would like to discuss this training material we talked about a month or so ago ;)
[16:29:53] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[16:35:38] <ben_alman> sex
[16:35:39] <bot-t> (5 mins 46 secs ago) <jaubourg> tell ben_alman: got hooked up in work and didn't realize I had a training to give next week... would like to discuss this training material we talked about a month or so ago ;)
[16:36:08] <ben_alman> jaubourg, tbh i have a training this week
[16:36:14] <ben_alman> so i'm not sure how much time i'll have
[16:36:26] <ben_alman> definitely none until thursday at the hearliest
[16:38:10] <ben_alman> bbiam
[16:39:12] <jaubourg> arf
[16:39:42] <jaubourg> thing is I have no material of mine so far so I'd better find something to train about for these three days ><
[16:39:57] <jaubourg> looks like I'll have a hell of a week :P
[16:58:46] <ben_alman> 8pm and so light out
[16:58:48] <ben_alman> awesome
[17:17:21] <jaubourg> ><
[17:32:22] <ben_alman> does this disturb anyone else, or just me http://benalman.com/grab/5db060.png
[17:37:01] <jaubourg> I dunno what I'm supposed to look at :P
[17:37:25] <ben_alman> just .. how js works
[17:37:45] <jaubourg> oh, that, I gave up on this somehow... it just doesn't make sense most of the time
[17:40:17] <jaubourg> so anyway, ben, do you still wish to share training material with me? I really need to know so that I can schedule what I need to do this week
[17:40:26] <ben_alman> well i don't know that i have time tbh
[17:40:30] <ben_alman> i'm doing a training this week
[17:40:33] <ben_alman> i'm preparing for it right now
[17:41:42] <jaubourg> ok, so I'll have to make this three days training from scratch... at least I know :P
[17:42:01] <ben_alman> i can give you some slides
[17:42:04] <ben_alman> and maybe that will help
[17:42:12] <ben_alman> let me give you a link
[17:42:13] <jaubourg> that would be awesome
[17:42:41] <ben_alman> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/294332/Bocoup/jq_comp_trav_2011_05.zip
[17:42:50] <ben_alman> the slides work best in FF4
[17:43:09] <ben_alman> and i have a test page called like test-page.html that i use in chrome to show all my examples
[17:43:15] <ben_alman> there are also some exercises
[17:43:24] <ben_alman> feel free to base your stuff off of this
[17:43:33] <ben_alman> i need to rework my ajax slides
[17:43:41] <jaubourg> man you're so helpful, thanks so much
[17:43:44] <ben_alman> and i'm in the process of revamping, as always
[17:43:46] <ben_alman> np
[17:44:45] <jaubourg> thanks so much :)
[17:44:51] <ben_alman> i hope it helps
[17:44:58] <jaubourg> it definitely will
[17:45:00] <ben_alman> do me a favor
[17:45:11] <ben_alman> go through my slides and offer cosntructive criticism
[17:45:23] <ben_alman> give it to me after your training is all done
[17:45:33] <ben_alman> if you can
[17:45:46] <jaubourg> will do
[17:45:48] <ben_alman> it would help me
[17:45:48] <ben_alman> thanks
[17:48:33] <jaubourg> you wouldn't happen to have something on the ui widget factory would you?
[17:48:38] <ben_alman> no
[17:48:41] <ben_alman> ajpiano does
[17:48:44] <jaubourg> k
[17:48:44] <ben_alman> it's intense
[17:49:18] <ben_alman> check this out https://gist.github.com/1036978
[17:49:20] <ben_alman> heh
[17:49:31] <ben_alman> that's a pretty good snippet for knowing what == what
[17:49:41] <ben_alman> i might make minor tweaks
[17:53:26] <jaubourg> heh
[17:53:36] <jaubourg> == is such a hell of an operator
[17:54:23] <ben_alman> ok fixed https://gist.github.com/1036978
[17:54:43] <ben_alman> the best ones are the ones that are truthy but == false
[17:55:09] <ben_alman> ?eval [] ? "truthy" : "falsy"
[17:55:12] <bot-t> ben_alman: "truthy"
[17:55:17] <ben_alman> ?eval [] == false
[17:55:20] <bot-t> ben_alman: true
[17:55:47] <jaubourg> omg, I see what you mean
[17:56:42] <ben_alman> ?eval [].toString()
[17:56:45] <bot-t> ben_alman: ""
[17:56:48] <ben_alman> see?
[17:58:13] <jaubourg> yeah, I see how it makes sense in its madness
