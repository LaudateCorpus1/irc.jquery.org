[10:22:22] <frantic1048> Hello everyone, I'm frantic1048(https://frantic1048.com), a student from BIT, mainly foucous on frontend development. I'm interesting to GSoC idea: QUnit - Standard reporter interface.
[10:27:32] <timmywil> Hey frantic1048. I imagine you need to be hooked up with your mentor. jzaefferer or leobalter should point you in the right direction
[10:30:43] <timmywil> If they're not around right now, please message here again later. 
[10:31:45] <frantic1048> I have some questions about it. Is the idea means, to implement a standard reporter interface as draft(also with missing details) shows in Qunit, and the consumer side, like karma, implement an adapter for it, so that karma could work with Standard reporter interface, and work with Qunit uses Standard reporter interface.
[10:32:30] <frantic1048> Thanks, I see.
[10:34:19] <jzaefferer> hey frantic1048! I just added a "Getting Started" paragraph that might help: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2016-Ideas-List#qunit---standard-reporter-interface
[10:35:00] <jzaefferer> as for your question: All of it! For QUnit the will is there to adopt it, for other frameworks we need some lobbying
[10:35:52] <frantic1048> And further, make the standard reporter interface as common as possible. Then other test frameworks migrate to this interface, so things get more simpler as js-reporters README shows ?
[10:36:30] <jzaefferer> yeah, pretty much
[10:36:38] <frantic1048> Thank you jazefferer, I'm reading it.
[10:37:48] <frantic1048> oh, the link to `accepted proposal from last year` shows "You are not permitted to access this resource at this time."
[10:39:25] <jzaefferer> oh, okay
[10:42:21] <jzaefferer> I extracted the relevant part: https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/f551d372a1539284d376
[10:43:14] <frantic1048> Thank you, I see that.
