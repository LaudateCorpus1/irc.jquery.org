[21:55:40] <snover> DaveMethvin: we need to have another chatty chat!
[22:06:37] <snover> b-ot: Tell DaveMethvin that thing I just said about needing to have a chat when he gets back for me love ok?
[22:06:37] <b-ot> snover, I‚Äôll tell DaveMethvin about that.
[22:06:40] <snover> thanks
[22:06:54] <snover> b-ot: tell scott_gonzalez would you say the MS pointer event model is a good one that should be emulated?
[22:06:55] <b-ot> snover, I‚Äôll tell scott_gonzalez about that.
[23:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> snover: definitely
[23:42:22] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, you have one new message, say ‚Äúread‚Äù to me when you wish to read it.
[23:42:47] <snover> scott_gonzalez: ok. i thought that was probably the case. i think we will normalise to it in dojo 2‚Äôs event system.
[23:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> snover: There's a Pointer Events WG now, and all vendors are on board (nobody knows about Apple though).
[23:43:00] <scott_gonzalez> b-ot: read
[23:43:00] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, from snover, 1h 36m ago: would you say the MS pointer event model is a good one that should be emulated?
[23:43:09] <snover> twice the messages
[23:43:12] <snover> thanks b-ot
[23:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> snover: You might want to check out https://github.com/toolkitchen/PointerEvents
[23:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> We're considering just pushing people to use that instead of building our own polyfill in jQuery.
[23:44:54] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to build a compat layer for oldIE, but at least that would only need to be mouse -> pointer.
[23:45:02] <snover> https://github.com/toolkitchen/PointerEvents/blob/master/src/pointerevents.js kill me now, scott
[23:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's not the nicest. I'm sure we can clean it up.
[23:46:34] <snover> thanks for the ‚Ä¶pointer
[23:46:35] <snover> ‚Ä¶
[23:46:39] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[23:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> love the pun
[23:46:56] <snover> i‚Äôm glad someone appreciates it
[23:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> We haven't tested it yet, but if this can actually bring pointer event via native APIs to modern browsers, it seems good.
[23:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> Even if it means we still need to patch over oldIE, that's certainly better than doing the full thing.
[23:48:29] <scott_gonzalez> But that loader is definitely crazy. We need a build process.
[23:49:17] <snover> oh, i would expect if you were going to do something like this that it would be a hot new jquery 2-only feature
[23:49:39] <snover> seems like it would be a distinctly unpleasant challenge to try to take it back to ie6
[23:49:42] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, we want to get users off of mouse events ASAP.
[23:49:57] <snover> good luck with that! :)
[23:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> We want the pointer-only future to be here as soon as we can get it.
[23:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'm on the WG, so if you have any questions/concerns based on any work you guys do in dojo, just let me know.
[23:50:51] <snover> meeeee too.
[23:51:06] <snover> i suspect edchat never got back to you, did he?
[23:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so.
[23:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> You're on the WG? I guess you don't join the calls
[23:51:46] <snover> oh well. feedback from ibm is about as useful as the tickets that are used for dramatic readings
[23:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> Or do you just follow the mailing list?
[23:51:58] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[23:52:48] <snover> I am on whatever mailing list is used for Web IDL stuff, only because I bitched once about Web IDL and then bz came back at me and I decided that I don‚Äôt have enough time or energy to actually contribute to these things at this point
[23:53:09] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[23:53:51] <snover> i feel bad about it but i dunno what else to do really. it takes me like an hour to write an email.
[23:53:58] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we have a conference call every Tuesday, with a pretty consistent turn out.
[23:54:17] <scott_gonzalez> And we tend to make decisions quickly.
[23:55:07] <scott_gonzalez> So if there are any concerns, I'm sure we can get them resolved.
[23:55:11] <snover> sounds like fun
[23:55:26] <snover> I‚Äôm not sure what major issues we would run into really
[23:55:52] <snover> the problem I had that I approached the Web IDL group about was being able to delegate native platform objects
[23:55:54] <scott_gonzalez> Most of the stuff that's been brought up so far hasn't been big.
[23:56:01] <snover> like Events
[23:56:04] <scott_gonzalez> Other than the lack of enter/leave events.
[23:57:30] <snover> So long as it‚Äôs possible to augment event objects I doubt I will have any objection
[23:57:31] <snover> s
[23:57:35] <snover> but we‚Äôll see
[23:57:43] <snover> events are finally getting where they need to be. finally.
[23:57:53] <scott_gonzalez> On a completely unrelated note, I think mikesherov would want you to see this: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph?days=1000
[23:58:19] <snover> booooooooooom
[23:58:33] <snover> looks like he‚Äôs starting to slack off there at the end
[23:58:39] <snover> pick up the pace!
[23:58:58] <snover> it‚Äôs nice to discover that 50% of your tickets are invalid isn‚Äôt it? :)
[23:59:00] <scott_gonzalez> heh, we've got a lot of feature dev going on.
[23:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[23:59:29] <scott_gonzalez> That's a lot of invalids + duplicates + fixes + refactors.
