[04:06:10] <jq-jenkins> joern.zaefferer: Improve extractStacktrace() implementation. Fixes #254 - Include all relevant stack lines
[06:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf danheberden: What's going on with all the sites going down?
[06:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> blog.jqueryui.com is still down.
[06:35:58] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I dunno what's up with that either, but I restarted apache and mysqld on the blog.jquery.com  and api.jquery.com servers this weekend, and they seem to be up and running now.
[06:36:19] <kswedberg> I don't have shell access to blog.jqueryui.com, or I'd kick that one too
[06:36:46] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Ok, sounds like we'll have to wait. Thanks.
[06:37:39] <kswedberg> yeah. rworth might be able to do it, too. rworth, you around?
[06:38:19] <rworth> around, but don't seem to have access
[06:38:32] <kswedberg> ah, ok. thx for checking
[07:33:00] <gnarf> there are still a few old sites I can't get into
[07:33:08] <gnarf> these are some of them
[07:37:36] <danheberden> gnarf are the mysqld/apache processes starting on reboot?
[07:38:00] <danheberden> i'm wondering if (mt) is having to restart these boxes due to their clusters crashing during migrations or something?
[07:38:17] <danheberden> since, like last time, every service went down - dv and ve alike
[07:42:14] <gnarf> i don't know danheberden
[07:42:21] <gnarf> i don't have shell into those boxes afaik
[07:43:03] <danheberden> api and blog?
[07:43:09] <danheberden> i can add you to whatevs
[07:43:34] <danheberden> (and feel free to reset/add a root pw if you need to via (mt) in the event of some urgent thing-a-majig)
[08:43:14] <danheberden> blog.jqueryui.com back up
[08:43:38] <danheberden> these boxes are on the dv clusters that (mt) is migrating/destroying/obliterating/hurting/smashing
[08:43:46] <danheberden> which is probably why they keep having problems
[08:51:56] <snover> wishful thinking dan~
[08:56:36] <danheberden> snover er'day
[09:02:30] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: can you open #jquery-meeting? it's not letting me become an op
[09:02:32] <DaveMethvin> or ajpiano maybe ^^?
[09:03:12] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: not only are you an op, the channel is open
[09:03:12] <ircjsbot> ajpiano, you have one new message, from snover (one day and 11 hours ago). Tell me if you want to read it (“read”).
[09:03:12] <ajpiano> :p
[09:07:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah now it is, gnarf opened it
[09:07:10] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i was having the same problem
[09:07:10] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: my /msg 's to chanserv weren't going through
[09:07:11] <gnarf> so i reconnected
[09:07:11] <gnarf> ircjsbot: tell krinkle lets get together and talk about what I need to do to move testswarm to another machine
[09:07:11] <ircjsbot> gnarf, OK, I will tell krinkle if I see them.
[09:09:26] <ajpiano> danheberden: do you know what's going on with archive.plugins.jquery.com
[09:10:16] <danheberden> ajpiano no, since infra bombed i have no clue what's going on with anything :(
[09:10:17] <ajpiano> bummer
[09:10:19] <danheberden> it's probably just stopped like the others
[09:10:19] <ajpiano> we "need to get your act together your acting like a bunch of amateurs."
[09:10:19] <ajpiano> according to some angry guy on the blog comments
[09:11:14] <danheberden> there we go
[09:11:26] <ajpiano> awesome!!
[09:11:28] <ajpiano> thxxxxx
[09:11:48] <danheberden> let him know my address so he can start sending me a paycheck
[09:18:54] <gnarf> ajpiano / danheberden :)

[10:08:42] <gnarf> testing
[10:08:48] <DaveMethvin> .
[10:08:54] <gnarf> yay
[10:09:09] <DaveMethvin> well for you and me maybe
[10:11:21] <gnarf> where do we start?
[10:11:39] <gnarf> rwaldron ping?
[10:11:45] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to start with open unassigned tix gnarf rwaldron
[10:11:57] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=!closed&group=status&milestone=1.8
[10:14:26] <gnarf> so there is an issue with bugs#10467
[10:14:36] <rwaldron> gnarf pong
[10:14:43] <gnarf> async: false ajax requests
[10:14:44] <DaveMethvin> gnarf  yes
[10:14:47] <DaveMethvin> right
[10:15:11] <DaveMethvin> so i dunno how we can reconcile that without deprecating async: false
[10:15:17] <rwaldron> ack, I have to go
[10:15:17] <DaveMethvin> and removing it
[10:15:21] <DaveMethvin> ok cyl
[10:15:22] <rwaldron> have a call with facebook in 15
[10:15:28] <rwaldron> need to get lunch
[10:15:31] <rwaldron> sorry :(
[10:15:34] <DaveMethvin> see if you can run thru tix some time
[10:15:37] <DaveMethvin> np
[10:15:41] <DaveMethvin> say hi to zuck
[10:15:42] <rwaldron> Definitely
[10:15:47] <rwaldron> ugh
[10:15:51] * rwaldron barfs
[10:15:52] <rwaldron> ;)
[10:15:55] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah - we should probably deprecate?
[10:15:56] <DaveMethvin> BILLIONS!
[10:16:04] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: it wouldn't bother me
[10:16:07] <gnarf> push the async issue into 1.9?
[10:16:10] <timmywil> oh hi
[10:16:14] <gnarf> hey timmywil
[10:16:17] <DaveMethvin> just in time timmywil
[10:16:21] <DaveMethvin> bug triage
[10:16:22] <timmywil> glad I didn't miss it
[10:16:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah like a dentist appt glad! :P
[10:16:38] <gnarf> I don't think we should be supporting async: false in AJAX
[10:16:51] <DaveMethvin> rolling your own is not that much code
[10:16:54] <timmywil> oh, I did miss the meeting. Sorry, had another meeting. :)
[10:16:59] <timmywil> but now I'm here!
[10:17:06] <DaveMethvin> and we are happy!
[10:17:09] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: we might be able to compat it
[10:17:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah we could duck punch it
[10:17:35] <gnarf> no need - prefilters!
[10:17:42] <DaveMethvin> well that's #11013
[10:18:27] <DaveMethvin> scott mentions the beforeunload use case
[10:18:38] <DaveMethvin> but really it's again just about communication
[10:18:41] <DaveMethvin> we need to give fair warning
[10:19:55] <DaveMethvin> let me deprecate that and close the ticket
[10:20:16] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #104: STILL FAILING in 31 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/104/
[10:20:16] <jq-jenkins> waldron.rick: Strips IIFEs from modules; Always require built jQuery for tests.
[10:21:02] <timmywil> STILL FAILING
[10:21:09] <timmywil> I'm so dissapointed
[10:21:12] <gnarf> STILL FLAILING
[10:21:41] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we have ever had a successful run
[10:21:55] <timmywil> no, I don't think we have either
[10:22:01] <timmywil> but these days it is mostly due to timeouts
[10:22:13] <timmywil> takes way to long to run the tests
[10:22:18] <timmywil> too*
[10:22:32] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: 10903 -- any update in the last 6 months?
[10:22:50] <DaveMethvin> just a sec
[10:24:34] <DaveMethvin> k, async:false now deprecated
[10:25:02] <timmywil> closed docs#11212
[10:25:03] <bot-t> [#11212] Sizzle.getText converts unbreakable space into whitespace on IE (closed bug: fixed in v1.8) - http://jqbug.com/11212
[10:25:11] <DaveMethvin> yay
[10:25:41] <DaveMethvin> on #10903 imma close it wontfix
[10:26:03] <DaveMethvin> there is a solution but it involves attaching all the content to the doc which is not a good idea in general
[10:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> WHOA! Dropping sync XHR?
[10:27:18] <timmywil> http://goo.gl/LY9I6 open unassigned
[10:27:29] <timmywil> if that's helpful
[10:28:33] <gnarf> 11010 - promise/a
[10:29:00] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez:  we're doing it for you
[10:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> heh, I actually think sync XHR should stay :-P
[10:29:22] <DaveMethvin> we can either close that one or the one that says we will make promises resolve async
[10:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> It just shouldn't use promises.
[10:29:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah - if thats the case, its a compat prefilter issue
[10:29:43] <gnarf> why include it in the lib
[10:29:53] <DaveMethvin> well there's no  harm in deprecating it, since it's horrible practice
[10:29:55] <scott_gonzalez> Because there are valid use cases for sync XHR
[10:29:56] <gnarf> its bad practice 99% of the time, and the 1% who need can install the compat
[10:29:57] <scott_gonzalez> like beforeunload
[10:30:10] <DaveMethvin> yup
[10:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> As long as compat isn't massive, that's fine.
[10:30:26] <DaveMethvin> only as massive as the stuff we can manage to pry out
[10:30:40] <gnarf> i would think it would be pretty tiny - if not a wrapper in front of $.ajax
[10:30:49] <gnarf> $.sjax
[10:31:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah even the acronym is rong
[10:31:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'd be fine with $.sjax.
[10:31:55] <gnarf> as far as promise/a goes - the execptions issue is the stickiest point
[10:32:08] <gnarf> i don't know if we want to solve it
[10:32:23] <gnarf> i seem to be on jaubourg's side of saying that we dont
[10:32:54] <scott_gonzalez> I discussed this with DaveMethvin.
[10:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Do you remember if either of us convinced the other?
[10:33:13] <gnarf> lol
[10:33:24] <DaveMethvin> we can solve the exceptions part with triggered events
[10:33:30] <DaveMethvin> but they make promises like 10x slower
[10:33:35] <DaveMethvin> according to jaubourg
[10:33:45] <scott_gonzalez> Does he have proof?
[10:33:47] <DaveMethvin> since that's a lot of armour to carrya round
[10:33:52] <DaveMethvin> he had a test case
[10:33:58] <DaveMethvin> i will ask  him for a link
[10:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, wait, why do we need triggered events?
[10:34:22] <DaveMethvin> to insulate us from script errors
[10:34:39] <scott_gonzalez> The conversation is starting to come back to me.
[10:34:51] <DaveMethvin> we don't want to try-catch the error
[10:35:01] <DaveMethvin> b/c rethrowing it loses useful error info
[10:35:09] <scott_gonzalez> Don't we just wnat to try/catch and then reject the chained promise?
[10:35:32] <DaveMethvin> debugging nightmare though, right?
[10:35:46] <scott_gonzalez> unsure
[10:35:50] <DaveMethvin> you mean, just silently say, "something died?"
[10:35:51] <gnarf> i'm on the jaubourg boat - don't ever try and catch my exception - if i didn't catch it myself it shouldn't of happened
[10:35:53] <timmywil> yes it is
[10:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: It's not silent, is it? Doesn't it reject a promise automatically?
[10:36:31] <DaveMethvin> that's all you know though
[10:36:34] <gnarf> if i want a promise to be rejected in an excpetion case, i write the code to do it
[10:36:56] <gnarf> but
[10:37:04] <gnarf> i can see the reasoning behind the other side too
[10:37:06] <DaveMethvin> there are several scenarios here
[10:37:34] <scott_gonzalez> I won't argue this too much. I don't have much interest in CommonJS :-P
[10:37:58] <scott_gonzalez> But Promises/A seems reasonable.
[10:38:05] <DaveMethvin> but if your code to do something has a programming error that causes a problem that's diff than a logic rejection
[10:38:25] <DaveMethvin> and if we catch it and reject it is hard to debug the programming error
[10:38:30] <DaveMethvin> no line info etc
[10:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> I personally don't want to argue for try/catch without specific use cases and example code.
[10:38:49] <scott_gonzalez> And I don't want to spend time putting those together right now :-P
[10:39:03] <timmywil> Does Promises/A say we should keep going if there's an error?
[10:39:17] <scott_gonzalez> That's what the error details are for.
[10:39:20] <DaveMethvin> i think it's kind of implied
[10:39:28] <timmywil> Seems like we've already learned from experience not to try/catch user errors
[10:39:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah, agreed there
[10:40:02] <DaveMethvin> if the user's code throws and leaves the promise in a broken state, then all bets are off
[10:40:02] <gnarf> and thats the fundamental difference between jQuery.promise and Promises/A
[10:40:06] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: But that's because in the past there has been no course of action to take, correct?
[10:40:09] <DaveMethvin> it would be nice if we could give a consistent state
[10:40:14] <gnarf> well, that and pipe / then stuff
[10:40:27] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: because debugging is more important to our users than that something fail silently
[10:40:44] <timmywil> or fail and keep going
[10:41:21] <gnarf> it just feels like we don't want to fix that one
[10:41:27] <gnarf> because of the exceptions issue mostly
[10:41:36] <scott_gonzalez> The thing is that errorHandlers are the equivalent of catch in promises.
[10:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> It is the only way to handle an unexpected error asynchronously.
[10:41:59] <DaveMethvin> but again, how do you debug that?
[10:42:19] <timmywil> you can't as efficiently in a browser
[10:42:30] <DaveMethvin> it's bad enough when our own code has try/catch that causes collateral damage like that
[10:42:42] <DaveMethvin> but here we are providing a service that calls user code and potentially masks errors
[10:43:30] <timmywil> fyi, as we've been talking, I've assigned myself a couple of the unassigned bugs. might want to refresh the list.
[10:43:48] <scott_gonzalez> $.deferred.throws = true?
[10:43:49] <DaveMethvin> before the ajax rewrite we had one of these where any error in the success callback would be caught and call the error callback ... fun times
[10:46:29] <DaveMethvin> i have to run in a sec but will keep banging on the list here

[11:02:39] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: can you call my skype?
[11:03:50] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: what's your skype again?
[11:04:06] <DaveMethvin> i have two but neither seem online
[11:05:07] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: it says you're unreachable as well
[11:05:11] <mikesherov> and that you're offline
[11:05:28] <DaveMethvin> well skype is a lying sob
[11:06:35] <gnarf> just got reconnected
[11:06:38] <gnarf> bad day for internets it seems
[11:10:45] <gnarf> back now
[11:11:28] <mikesherov_> here
[11:11:42] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: you have the link for the tixx
[11:11:44] <mikesherov_> ?
[11:11:57] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=pending&status=reopened&milestone=1.8&group=status&order=priority
[11:12:01] <DaveMethvin> sorry about the length
[11:12:27] <mikesherov_> twss
[11:12:30] <gnarf> seems that list of unassigned is hitting some strange cases
[11:13:29] <mikesherov_> none of the open ones seem like a job for me
[11:13:51] <gnarf> same
[11:14:19] <DaveMethvin> well that's o-kay, as long as you have plenty of stuff to do
[11:14:22] <DaveMethvin> :D
[11:14:35] <timmywil> oh we're on skype?
[11:14:36] <timmywil> :P
[11:14:38] <timmywil> I"m online!
[11:14:44] <mikesherov_> I'm not on skype
[11:14:48] <mikesherov_> we're just doing it here
[11:14:55] <timmywil> k
[11:16:38] <mikesherov_> so I have: modularize css and dimensions, fix a few effects bugs, break jQuery.support into it's respective modules, and documenting all feature detect tests (groundwork for 2.0)
[11:18:09] <DaveMethvin> so mikesherov_ just get it done by 4pm and i can land it all today. :P
[11:19:10] <mikesherov_> I can get it done this weekend
[11:19:14] <mikesherov_> no joke
[11:19:45] <mikesherov_> I'd love to get my hands dirty in other parts of the system, I'm just reluctant to do so at this stage of the game for 1.8
[11:20:11] <mikesherov_> plus we have a ticket owned by lrbabe
[11:20:26] <mikesherov_> either we need to ping him, or make someone else own it
[11:21:28] <gnarf> i'll pick it up
[11:21:41] <gnarf> so - there is the basic for support of this in the new rewrite
[11:21:48] <gnarf> you can actually replace the timer tick functions
[11:22:04] <gnarf> #9384?
[11:25:50] <mikesherov_> .
[11:31:55] <mikesherov_> so...
[11:56:03] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: i'm getting a grunt fail in the new dist task
[11:56:30] <DaveMethvin> the key is "*" so it tries to write to */jquery.js
[11:59:23] <DaveMethvin> also did you want the dist task to go before lint?
[11:59:43] <DaveMethvin> oh heck, and min as well since dist copied the minified one
[11:59:49] <DaveMethvin> you're copying over the old min
[12:17:15] <DaveMethvin> gnarf can you run unit tests off master?
[12:17:24] <DaveMethvin> mine is breaky
[12:17:30] <DaveMethvin> just tryna figure out why
[14:24:03] <DaveMethvin> gnarf rwaldron timmywil are you able to run unit tests off the current master?
[14:24:22] <timmywil> just a sec
[14:25:53] <timmywil> nope, looks like it's not writing to the right place
[14:26:09] <timmywil> it's actually creating a folder called "*"
[14:26:51] <timmywil> careful not to rm -rf *
[14:26:53] <timmywil> :)
[14:27:03] <timmywil> rm -rf "*"
[14:27:57] <miketaylr> D:
[14:29:21] <DaveMethvin> no way i'd be that stupid
[14:30:26] <DaveMethvin> try using this stuff in Windows, then you'll really know what it's like to be a man
[14:31:24] <DaveMethvin> well even after I remove that task the unit tests aren't running, but I didn't want to dig deeper until I knew if anyone else saw it
[14:31:43] <timmywil> tests can't run without that task
[14:32:09] <DaveMethvin> i thought that one was just optionally copying the file
[14:32:15] <DaveMethvin> lemme go back and look
[14:32:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah i don't think the dist task looks mandatory
[14:35:48] <timmywil> you're right, but dist/jquery.js is 404
[14:35:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[14:35:59] <timmywil> ah, well
[14:36:03] <DaveMethvin> it wants the server to be rooted at jquery
[14:36:07] <DaveMethvin> ?
[14:36:15] <timmywil> yea apparently
[14:36:33] <timmywil> just remove the /
[14:37:04] <timmywil> ../
[14:37:22] <DaveMethvin> must be some rwaldron-isms remaining
[14:40:09] <timmywil> include_js.php was always a relative path, that should probably stay the same
[14:48:34] <DaveMethvin> GAH
[14:48:41] <DaveMethvin> the php is screwing with the path
[14:48:43] <DaveMethvin> gotta go

[15:04:43] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Relativize all urls pertaining to dist/jquery.js so users can run their server from any file location; Make sure Sizzle is available for its tests in testrunner. - timmywil
[15:07:05] <timmywil> ?tell DaveMethvin tests should run for you now
[15:07:05] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[15:16:14] <corystal> Trying to swap link text, but jQuery mobile buried it in some some spans.... should this code target the .ui-btn-text span that the text is in????
[15:16:16] <corystal>  $(this).children('.ui-btn-text').text($(this).children('.ui-btn-text').text() == 'Expand' ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand');
[15:17:12] <danheberden> corystal: would using the css selectors and changing the `content` css property be easier?
[15:18:18] <corystal> lemme think about that...
[15:24:40] <corystal> As opposed to using the text() method?
[15:24:42] <corystal> Can you give an example?
[15:25:40] <danheberden> .ui-btn-text span { content: "Collapse"; } ?
[15:26:01] <danheberden> but, like, qualified to the element you want
[15:27:26] <danheberden> you could even add a class like .ui-btn.collapse .ui-btn-text span { content: "collapse"; } and add remove that class on the parent
[15:31:38] <corystal> I'll give that a try
[15:31:46] <corystal> thx

[16:10:37] <gnarf> danheberden: that tip just blew my mind
[16:10:40] <gnarf> that shit works? :)

[17:42:01] <bot-t> (2 hours 34 mins ago) <timmywil> tell DaveMethvin tests should run for you now
[17:42:12] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[17:44:26] * DaveMethvin removes dist
[19:39:18] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/810/files
[19:39:19] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (1m, 9s ago): fixes #11856, make dimensions modular!
[19:39:31] <mikesherov> modular dimensions was easy
[19:39:38] <DaveMethvin> sweet mikesherov!
[19:39:50] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell gibson042 awesome work on the build flags for modularization
[19:39:50] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[19:40:03] <DaveMethvin> as long as there are no hairy deps it's not a prob with the build flags
[19:40:08] <mikesherov> Yeah
[19:40:14] <mikesherov> dimensions was easy
[19:40:16] <mikesherov> effects too
[19:40:33] <DaveMethvin> ajax has a coupla issues but should be doable
[19:40:36] <mikesherov> in my ticket for css modularization, I mentioned we should have the dep-graph listed somehwere
[19:40:50] <DaveMethvin> i saw gibson's suggestion, that might work
[19:40:52] <mikesherov> Rick mentioned keeping a YAML file
[19:41:00] <mikesherov> I like gibson's suggestion
[19:41:12] <mikesherov> or at least a JSON file or something
[19:41:26] <DaveMethvin> if we end up with some fancier build process we'd need it visible to grunt anyway, or a grunt plugin
[19:41:31] <mikesherov> hey _trev: you here?
[19:41:43] <mikesherov> yeah
[19:42:16] <mikesherov> I'll probably go with gibson042's suggestion for right now, as that's my path of least resistance
[19:42:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah we can pull it out to a separate file later if needed
[19:42:39] <mikesherov> would be nice to contrib back to cowboy the modular change plugin
[19:43:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah and at some point do the remaining makefile items
[19:43:10] <mikesherov> there was talk of how to do this over at Modernizr, when sindresorhus presented a grunt PR to them
[19:43:44] <mikesherov> prob makes sense to share that with them too, if we come up with a good soln
[19:43:57] <DaveMethvin> yep they should be simple and general i'd think
[19:44:34] <DaveMethvin> i liked rick's feature to copy the dist files to other dirs (such as dropbox) but it seems broken atm
[19:44:50] <DaveMethvin> the dist task
[19:46:33] <mikesherov> don't merge my dimensions modularity thing yet
[19:46:38] <DaveMethvin> np
[19:46:49] <DaveMethvin> i have a few tickets of my own to tackle
[19:46:49] <mikesherov> my feature detect is wonky
[19:47:01] <DaveMethvin> was going todo them earlier but got caught by the build bugs
[19:49:28] <mikesherov> ok I fixed the issue, 810 you can merge at will.
[19:49:51] <mikesherov> I gotta run. I'll submit a PR for the IE8 dimension fails tomorrow
[19:50:29] <DaveMethvin> cyl mike
[19:51:56] <mikesherov> yeah, ftr, the curent `grunt` creates a file called */jquery.js
[19:52:05] <mikesherov> I assume that's part of the build bugs?
[19:52:09] <mikesherov> cyl
