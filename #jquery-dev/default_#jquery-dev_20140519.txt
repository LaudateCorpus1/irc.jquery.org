[09:45:05] <jzaefferer> leobalter: regarding updating projects to use the assert argument: You should talk to scott_gonzalez about that, he thinks it should be scriptable. Having a migration script might be good for third-party project as well as our own.

[17:37:50] <leobalter> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez that might be good. I'll check jQuery Migrate to see how it's done. I'm looking forward to start working on those patches.

[20:00:47] <Emon> I need help 
[20:54:35] <leobalter> Emon: have you tried the #jquery channel?  
[20:55:03] <Emon> nope
[20:57:44] <leobalter> there're some people there to help you. #jquery is the support chart (using jQuery, writing plugins, etc)
[20:58:06] <snover> but who can help with my broken heart
[20:59:39] <leobalter> the $
[21:00:20] <Emon> thanks
[21:00:21] <leobalter> when it stands for jQuery, of course. Because money won't buy you a heart.
[21:00:35] <Emon> ha ha
[21:00:52] <Emon> thanks
[21:01:05] <leobalter> :)
