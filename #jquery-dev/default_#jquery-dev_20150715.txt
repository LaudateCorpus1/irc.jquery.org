[07:31:54] <markelog> DaveMethvin, timmywil: Didn't expect such pushback from domenic or anyone else, i'm sorry if i put you guys in such unpleasant predicament :-(
[07:32:26] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea why domenic is acting like that, but i'm pretty bugged about it
[07:32:49] <DaveMethvin> we're not testing with old chromes that aren't in the wild
[07:33:07] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea why more testing is bad
[07:33:17] <DaveMethvin> and why we are accused of being paid off for doing it
[07:34:35] <markelog> his opinion seems pretty peculiar, maybe he just in bad mood or something 
[07:36:29] <markelog> i can tell that no one "task" me to do something, purely mine initiative

[07:51:24] <arthurvr> Ugh that last ticket
[07:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> Haha, that user created a GitHub account just to file that issue.
[07:52:53] <arthurvr> Yeah. I don‚Äôt really know what to think about that.
[07:57:04] <arthurvr> Yay that ticket is gona already :)
[07:57:19] <arthurvr> s/gona/gone
[08:01:10] <DaveMethvin> when an influential person in the community accuses you of something shady without any evidence, it sticks around. Glad he apologized but at least one person on Twitter took it as fact
[08:01:38] <DaveMethvin> or, best case, it was David Mark :)

[08:04:45] <arthurvr> The fact that it only takes a few minutes to create an account is really getting a problem on GitHub. Email verification isn‚Äôt even a requirement.
[08:04:58] <DaveMethvin> yep
[08:05:15] <DaveMethvin> for all we know it could be the same troll who harasses you arthurvr 
[08:05:34] <arthurvr> Nah
[08:06:20] <arthurvr> I‚Äôm not active on the jquery/jquery repo and this is at least about something. My issues generally don‚Äôt have more content than ‚Äùfaggooott‚Äù :p
[08:08:13] <markelog> but github set very very small rate limits on api requests, can't use their api for legit reasons, but can harass ppl :-(
[08:11:27] <timmywil> Unfortunately, the people who read Domenic's tweet and accepted it as truth think they have a legitimate grievance. I'd like to be senstive to that, but at the same time avoid engaging with trolls.
[08:12:20] <arthurvr> Whatever you‚Äôre going to do is gonna feed trolls in some way.
[08:13:21] <DaveMethvin> i'm talking to domenic now, we'll try to fix whatever we can
[08:20:54] <timmywil> arthurvr: I don't intend to more than speak to those with concerns directly. Doing it on a public forum would further feed the beast.
[08:21:22] <DaveMethvin> most of the tweets are gone now

[08:51:26] <timmywil> I never facepalmed so many times in one day.
[08:54:41] <DaveMethvin> Clearly people there is a vast profit potential in charging for browsers to be tested in jQuery.
[08:54:50] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: how do you delete an issue?
[08:55:02] <timmywil> ha, I thought you did
[08:55:16] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[08:55:17] <timmywil> I figured it required more permissions than I have.
[08:55:19] <arthurvr> You can‚Äôt delete issues
[08:55:23] <timmywil> Did GitHub do it?
[08:55:25] <DaveMethvin> SOMEONE DID!
[08:55:33] <DaveMethvin> must have been
[08:55:33] <timmywil> ajpiano: did you?
[08:55:34] <arthurvr> I messaged GH support :p
[08:55:37] <DaveMethvin> ah
[08:55:42] <DaveMethvin> thanks arthurvr 
[08:55:56] <DaveMethvin> i guess you know the process well now
[08:56:18] <DaveMethvin> they should just give you direct sql access to the issue database so you can "delete troll from issues"
[08:56:32] <timmywil> I'm impressed with GitHub right now
[08:56:49] <DaveMethvin> it would really help if people had to verify their emails
[08:56:53] <timmywil> There are so many reasons this is dumb.
[08:57:32] <timmywil> Maybe we can Jenn to write something ;)
[08:57:36] <timmywil> can get
[08:58:10] <arthurvr> support at github dot com :p 
[08:58:14] <arthurvr> though it doesn‚Äôt help much
[08:59:27] <timmywil> Deleting the issue that quickly shows either trust or an understanding of the situation or both. Regardless, I'm impressed.
[09:00:03] <DaveMethvin> i think they're scared of arthurvr at this point and do what he says :)
[09:00:14] <timmywil> as we all should
[09:00:21] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:00:27] <arthurvr> :p
[09:00:50] <arthurvr> http://imgur.com/wDQeCSP
[09:01:13] <arthurvr> I mean they should know me already right :p
[09:01:29] <timmywil> I'm sorry you've had to email them that much
[09:02:02] <DaveMethvin> at this point i'm pretty sure some bot just looks for his email address and deletes whatever he linked. :P
[09:02:20] <timmywil> ha
[09:04:25] <arthurvr> Pretty crazy though. How difficult can mail verification be :p

[09:05:49] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: what are your thoughts about https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1875#issuecomment-121575191
[09:06:10] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking if phystuck wanted to do the work and test, we could land if it really was that simple
[09:06:22] <DaveMethvin> i'm more concerned about it becoming two code paths
[09:06:32] <timmywil> I think we should establish if there's an actual leak first
[09:06:55] <DaveMethvin> i think its more that there's no reason to use <a> if `new URL` does the job
[09:07:06] <DaveMethvin> saves creating a DOM element whether it leaks or not
[09:07:19] <timmywil> yea, but like you said, if it's not supported in all of our browsers, I don't see the advantage.
[09:07:42] <DaveMethvin> well only ie would need the <a> and if it is a one line change it's not bad
[09:07:50] <DaveMethvin> but again i don't want to end up with two code paths
[09:07:51] <timmywil> I think the cost of creating an element is pretty small
[09:07:56] <DaveMethvin> definitely
[09:07:59] <timmywil> we do it a lot for support tests
[09:08:07] <DaveMethvin> and this only happens a few times a second at most
[09:08:17] <DaveMethvin> we're not creating thousands of ajax req per second
[09:08:34] <DaveMethvin> but i figured if he wanted to do it we could land it
[09:09:01] <timmywil> yea, there's a couple concerns. We don't think two codepaths is worth the size and we can probably fix any leaks caused by element creation with a = null.

[09:09:13] <timmywil> sigh
[09:09:14] <DaveMethvin> oh geez
[09:09:31] <timmywil> I got this one
[09:10:20] <gibson042> I would rather reuse `originAnchor` than split into sometimes document.createElement and sometimes `new URL()`
[09:11:28] <timmywil> ok, well said scott_gonzalez 
[09:11:28] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15scottgonzalez closed issue #2474: What did you get for promoting Yandex? 02http://git.io/vmlbk
[09:11:49] <DaveMethvin> although a blowjob would have been nice
[09:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> This is just ridiculous.
[09:12:18] <timmywil> this is bordering on harassment, right?
[09:12:23] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: in the original PR we talked about that, i was a bit superstitious about reusing the object
[09:12:31] <DaveMethvin> bordering? 
[09:13:11] <timmywil> just making sure I'm being fair with that word
[09:13:28] <DaveMethvin> oh def
[09:14:04] <DaveMethvin> that's what bothered me so much about domenic's original tweet, and enough ppl follow him that at least a few thought he was stating fact
[09:14:18] <timmywil> IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE
[09:14:25] <DaveMethvin> if someone had given us money we would have been happy to say they were sponsoring us
[09:14:40] <DaveMethvin> why would we take money under the table?
[09:14:53] <DaveMethvin> why is more testing not good?
[09:14:57] <arthurvr> Not like we don‚Äôt do everything else in the open :p 
[09:15:02] <arthurvr> yeah exactly
[09:15:34] <DaveMethvin> if you want a conspiracy, why is google so interested in marginalizing all the other chromium-based browsers?
[09:15:59] <DaveMethvin> (tho that one seems pretty obvious)
[09:16:00] <timmywil> I still haven't heard a good reason for why it's "weird" that we mentioned it. Even if it is exactly like Chromium, it's a browser that was released and we will test it separately.
[09:17:28] <timmywil> Are people mad that it exists?
[09:17:33] <DaveMethvin> and honestly this is open source, if someone volunteers to do something and it is a good thing, it is going to get done because we have a person to scratch that itch
[09:18:14] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure that google, microsoft, opera would rather have that market share
[09:18:22] <DaveMethvin> come to think of it why do we test opera?
[09:18:27] <DaveMethvin> it's "just chromium"
[09:18:53] <markelog> maybe because chrome is competitor to google, maybe this is why they were felt "weird" about it
[09:19:00] <timmywil> Is there an argument for not supporting it? And if so, are we supposed to trust that it will never branch from Chromium? And if it is Chrome 38 or whatever, someone is calling it stable, which means we have to test it.
[09:19:00] <markelog> god damn
[09:19:12] <markelog> i meant yandex competitor to google )
[09:19:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:19:40] <jzaefferer> What was Domenic's original tweet?
[09:20:18] <markelog> this story feels so blow up out of proportion, especially bit about conspiracy theory
[09:20:30] <DaveMethvin> i don't think i kept it, but it basically said "you guys should be more honest about accepting money for putting yandex on your test matrix"
[09:20:46] <DaveMethvin> as if he knew for a fact we were paid to do it
[09:20:59] <DaveMethvin> and now some troll is creating bogus issues echoing that

[09:21:51] <markelog> ((
[09:22:09] <DaveMethvin> well good then he is definitely just a troll because he knows his statements are false
[09:22:38] <DaveMethvin> http://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2015/02/chrome_continue.html
[09:22:59] <DaveMethvin> this shows that chromium is becoming more of a problem as far as version spread
[09:23:15] <DaveMethvin> but we don't test chromiums, we test specific browsers
[09:23:26] <DaveMethvin> which is exactly what we are doing with Yandex
