[05:01:58] <JamesMGreene> Hey Krinkle|detached jzaefferer
[05:03:36] <JamesMGreene> So when Krinkle|detached broke out the JUnitLogger as qunit-reporter-junit, he already renamed the *.js file to "qunit-reporter-junit.js", which makes perfect sense.  However, I'm curious if the qunit-contrib-composite repo should include "-contrib" in its *.js and *.css file, or if it should just be "qunit-composite.*" and leave the "-contrib" annotation strictly at the repo name level. 
[05:03:36] <JamesMGreene> Thoughts?
[05:07:31] <jzaefferer> I'm good with keeping it simple
[05:07:50] <jzaefferer> Do we need the "contrib-" part at all?
[05:11:46] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: do you want to land the various phantomjs PRs?
[05:12:18] <jzaefferer> Apart from those, there's the test-in-node PRs...
[05:12:30] <jzaefferer> I'm setting up travis
[05:12:35] <jzaefferer> for the main QUnit repo

[05:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin|away mikesherov wycats__: Can someone with more knowledge of jQuery's offset code respond to this? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2013JanMar/0881.html
[05:23:35] <scott_gonzalez> My cocerns is that scripts that work in normal DOM will fail in shadow DOM.
[05:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> e.g., elem1.offset( elem2.offset() )
[05:24:07] <scott_gonzalez> However, a quick glance at our code makes me think that it our code will work.
[05:24:26] <scott_gonzalez> Which of course makes me wonder why we need so much code.
[05:24:41] <scott_gonzalez> There aren't support comments in the offset code.
[05:25:35] <scott_gonzalez> But it seems to me like if browsers didn't have bugs, the code could be simple, and the simple code would fail.
[05:28:41] <mikesherov> so, we don't use offsetLeft and offsetTop
[05:29:58] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: Personally, I don't feel the need for the "-contrib"
[05:30:17] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: And yes, I will land the PhantomJS runner PRs
[05:31:08] <mikesherov> the question, for jQuery, is what's the relation between offetParent and getBoundingRectClient
[05:31:30] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: okay great. How about I just rename the composite repo? You can update your remote with `git remote set-url`, and we won't speak of "contrib" ever again ;)
[05:31:35] <jzaefferer> the repo is empty anyway...
[05:32:41] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: Sounds good
[05:36:01] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: so this is wonky
[05:36:10] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: done: https://github.com/jquery/qunit-composite
[05:36:32] <jzaefferer> meanwhile I'm getting missing CLA signings :/
[05:36:43] <scott_gonzalez> re: "-contrib" for the love of all that is holy, please do not include it in the name.
[05:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: What's wonky? Our implementation or the proposal?
[05:37:55] <mikesherov> well, our implementation works, but mixes gCBR and offsetParent
[05:37:56] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: Can you turn on the composite repo's Travis hook, too?  I'll take care of the .travis.yml, etc.
[05:38:17] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: its gone
[05:38:33] <mikesherov> and gCBR gets viewport rectangles, adjusted for nothing
[05:39:08] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: :-)
[05:39:17] <mikesherov> i.e. gCBR needs to be scroll adjusted
[05:39:34] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: travis hook for composite is in
[05:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Does .offsetParent() work around bugs or missing .offsetParent in some browsers?
[05:41:05] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: thanks
[05:42:12] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: no.. it gets the top most offsetParnt
[05:42:46] <mikesherov> that isn't static
[05:43:49] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: hrmph, it seems the w3c definition differs from our implementation slightly
[05:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[05:44:19] <mikesherov> Ours doesn't stop implicitly stop on body nor td,th, table
[05:44:55] <mikesherov> I mean, I suppose if I trust our test suite, I could just remove the .offsetParent() loop and see what breaks!
[05:46:13] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: according to w3c, the body element should return null
[05:46:58] <mikesherov> anyway, jQuery's "offset" works fine with what W3C want's to do
[05:47:05] <mikesherov> but not "position"
[05:48:26] <mikesherov> offsetLeft, offsetTop not used with jQuery, and offsetParent only used by $.position'
[05:49:42] <mikesherov> if non-traversable roots can't be .offsetParents, then jQuery will just find position relative to the traversable offset
[05:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> Wel, .offsetParent() will find the *real* offset parent inside the shadow.
[05:50:50] <scott_gonzalez> Because we don't use .offsetParent, we just walk the tree looking at styles.
[06:57:06] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Can you pull an ajpiano on the Google CDN? I think it'd be pretty amusing.
[07:23:33] <ajpiano> lol, so that's what we're calling it now
[07:48:13] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez grunt-git-authors is returning duplicate people in some cases... unknown bug?
[07:48:56] <JamesMGreene> e.g. for QUnit repo, `grunt authors:"addons/composite/"` returns jzaefferer twice in the list
[07:49:22] <JamesMGreene> Same name, same email
[07:49:41] <JamesMGreene> Perhaps something else in the git entry differentiated him...?
[07:49:56] <jzaefferer> May need a .mailmap file like jQuery UI has
[07:49:56] <JamesMGreene> Either way, probably need to run a filter to eliminate dups
[07:50:06] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: Duplicates are already removed.
[07:50:19] <JamesMGreene> Then go run that command in the QUnit repo :)
[07:50:20] <scott_gonzalez> There must be something strange in the results.
[07:51:27] <JamesMGreene> btw, this "Wesley Walser" guy shows up with different name and email combos... for the AUTHORS.txt, can I just reduce it to the one he signed the CLA with?
[07:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: Use .mailmap
[07:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: For proof that the problem isn't in grunt-git-authors, run `git short -nse`
[07:54:39] <scott_gonzalez> sorry, `git shorlog -nse`
[07:54:42] <scott_gonzalez> damnit
[07:54:46] <scott_gonzalez> git shortlog -nse
[07:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> I suck at typing :-/

[07:55:38] <JamesMGreene>     86	jzaefferer <joern.zaefferer@gmail.com>
[07:55:43] <JamesMGreene> Maybe an encoding issue?
[07:56:01] <JamesMGreene> They both came out the same when I used grunt-git-authors, though
[07:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: They just look the same.
[07:56:16] <JamesMGreene> You and your umlaut, jzaefferer
[07:56:35] <scott_gonzalez> Do you need me to make a mailmap?
[07:56:53] <JamesMGreene> Looking at jQuery UI's now, looks self-explanatory for multiple emails
[07:57:02] <JamesMGreene> Is there a way to address the jzaefferer issue, though?
[07:57:16] <JamesMGreene> Or will .mailmap do that, too?
[07:57:26] <scott_gonzalez> JÃ¶rn Zaefferer <joern.zaefferer@gmail.com>
[07:58:16] <JamesMGreene> And that will make it always use that version of the name for every email that matches, right?
[07:58:18] <JamesMGreene> Makes sense
[07:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:58:49] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: tripping up Americans since 1984
[07:59:10] <scott_gonzalez> If a full, proper mailmap is created, grunt authors should exactly match AUTHORS.txt
[07:59:29] <scott_gonzalez> NOTE: There is a possible exception if the full history of the repo isn't in GitHub.
[07:59:48] <jzaefferer> I once had a TSA officer look at my passport and my ticket, then pointing out to me that my firstname wasn't written the same way. Of course the airlines just don't except the umlaut, so it was Joernâ€¦ he eventually let me pass anyway
[07:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> For example, there are authors for core and UI who don't exist in the git history
[08:00:15] <scott_gonzalez> Stupid TSA
[08:00:46] <JamesMGreene> Do I leave people's nicknames or map them to their real names?
[08:00:50] <JamesMGreene> e.g. busticated
[08:01:46] <JamesMGreene> speaking of which, jzaefferer, looks like busticated (itsbusticated@gmail.com) has not signed the CLA
[08:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> Always map to real name.
[08:02:23] <jzaefferer> As Jeff put it once: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1073412/javascript-validation-issue-with-international-characters/1073545#1073545 "crazy moon language characters (Ã Ã¨Ã¬Ã²Ã¹ etc)"

[08:03:37] <JamesMGreene> lol
[08:03:43] <JamesMGreene> crazy moon language indeed
[08:04:43] <JamesMGreene> If I'm using grunt-git-authors on a subdir, in which dir does the .mailmap need to exist?
[08:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> The root.
[08:05:43] <scott_gonzalez> `git help shortlog` and search for mailmap
[08:20:32] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez Any way to reduce the following 2 .mailmap lines into 1?
[08:20:33] <JamesMGreene> Wesley Walser <waw325@gmail.com> <wwalser@atlassian.com>
[08:20:33] <JamesMGreene> Wesley Walser <waw325@gmail.com> wwalser <waw325@gmail.com>
[08:21:02] <JamesMGreene> I didn't expect that 2nd line to be necessary at all but it seems that it is
[08:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: Nope, you'll need both.
[08:21:17] <JamesMGreene> k
[08:21:19] <JamesMGreene> thanks
[08:21:39] <JamesMGreene> So why is the 2nd line necessary?
[08:21:40] <scott_gonzalez> The second line might be able to just be "Wesley Walso <waw325@gmail.com> though.
[08:21:54] <JamesMGreene> Oh, sure
[08:21:57] <JamesMGreene> Now it makes sense
[08:21:59] <scott_gonzalez> Because the first line says "Adjust entries that have an email of wwalser@atlassian.com"
[08:22:27] <JamesMGreene> yup, that works
[08:22:28] <JamesMGreene> thanks
[08:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, when you have really whacky entries, it can be confusing at first.
[08:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[08:36:20] <jqcommit> [13qunit-reporter-junit] 15JamesMGreene opened pull request #6: Changed 'addon' to 'plugin'. (06master...06plugin_text)  02http://git.io/N-9YiQ
[08:51:31] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: are you going to commit the .mailmap for the qunit repo?
[08:52:59] <JamesMGreene> I can, was just doing it for composite right now
[09:00:31] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle|detached So I would say that Composite has a dependency on qunitjs but I see that Krinkle marked the JUnit reporter as just having a devDependency on it
[09:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: DO NOT ABUSE PACKAGE.JSON!
[09:00:54] <jzaefferer> hehe
[09:01:00] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: Yes yes, that's what I'm trying to clarify
[09:01:23] <JamesMGreene> So is it a devDependency because typically the consumer would have QUnit installed elsewhere?
[09:01:41] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: meeting?
[09:01:44] <JamesMGreene> (since it's browser-based testing and all)
[09:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> It should only be a devDependency if you need to for dev, e.g., to run the tests.
[09:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> But only if you're running tests through node.
[09:02:01] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov yeah but i can't open the channel!
[09:02:06] <DaveMethvin> won't let me be op
[09:02:12] <mikesherov> ugh
[09:02:20] <mikesherov> how about #jquery-meetin'
[09:02:25] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez Well the tests will be run through Node via Grunt
[09:02:32] <JamesMGreene> but using PhantomJS in reality
[09:02:48] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene scott_gonzalez: http://i.imgur.com/ZHIVWrh.jpg
[09:03:07] <JamesMGreene> lol nice
[09:03:16] <JamesMGreene> Y U ABUSE package.json???
[09:03:16] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: (å±®'Ð”')å±®
[09:03:45] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: we also want to run tests directly in node, right? Those other two PRs, remember?
[09:04:22] <jzaefferer> Btw. grunt plugins specify grunt as devDependency and peerDependency. This might also make sense for QUnit plugins
[09:05:28] <JamesMGreene> devDep and peerDep? Interesting
[09:05:48] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: Yes but QUnit Composite can't really run on Node
[09:05:52] <JamesMGreene> QUnit can
[09:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it makes sense to have both.
[09:06:31] <JamesMGreene> agreed with scott_gonzalez
[09:06:41] <jzaefferer> Well, for grunt plugins it makes sense
[09:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> Uness peerDependencies are ignored by default.
[09:06:48] <jzaefferer> I'm not sure about qunit-composite
[09:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember what the decision was on that.
[09:06:55] <jzaefferer> Why?
[09:07:44] <jzaefferer> When I install grunt-git-authors into my project, I don't want that to install grunt, but it should complain if I'm running an incompatible grunt version. That's the idea of peerDependencies, right?
[09:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I guess it makes sense if you're installing the dev depenencies and not peer dependencies when working on the repo.
[09:07:54] <jzaefferer> Yep
[09:08:16] <jzaefferer> peerDependencies are never installed (I think)
[09:08:37] <jzaefferer> but they need to be present when someone else uses your plugin
[09:32:10] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Why did you ask for a reduced test case of a feature? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13619
[09:32:17] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I'm 99% sure this is a duplicate.
[09:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> And even if it's not, it's not something that will be added to core.
[09:33:54] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: you know where the duplicate is?
[09:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to find it.
[09:34:07] <scott_gonzalez> I know this has come up over and over.
[09:34:17] <scott_gonzalez> Just not sure if it ever made it to the Trac.
[09:35:02] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: close http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7548
[09:35:37] <timmywil> thanks
[09:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> That was closed as a duplicate of http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3781
[09:36:19] <scott_gonzalez> So you can probably close this one as a duplicate of #3781 as well.
[09:36:21] <timmywil> true, but I like Dave's comment there
[09:36:37] <timmywil> can you close as duplicate of two tickets?
[09:36:53] <timmywil> anyway, I already closed
[09:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> Good enough :-)
[09:37:34] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I wrote this as .bindFirst() like 5 years ago.
[09:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> But then I was like "hmm...if I commit this, someone's gonna see it and use it."
[09:37:58] <timmywil> heh
[09:38:06] <scott_gonzalez> We were going to use it for modal dialogs in UI.

[10:22:35] <JamesMGreene> hey jzaefferer, when I remove the composite plugin from QUnit core, I'm assuming you want a PR so that it is tracked. Correct?
[10:23:18] <JamesMGreene> (i.e. vs just pushing the commit)
[10:23:44] <JamesMGreene> Well, I guess I could just push and reference its issue, so just let me know what you'd prefer
[10:27:45] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: PRs for tracking are only uesful if there's discussion tied to the PR.
[10:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> So if the expectation is that you send a PR, then it immediately merges, just skip the PR.
[10:28:15] <JamesMGreene> sounds good, scott_gonzalez
[10:28:56] <jzaefferer> yeah, in this case that's fine
[10:28:57] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: Regarding busticated, yes, I already looked him up but thanks!
[10:29:17] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: "Fixes #123" in the commit message is custom in that case.
[10:29:23] <Krinkle> At the end of the message.
[10:30:04] <Krinkle> In the case of removing the composite there isn't much to review, it's pretty trivial (the change itself)
[10:30:59] <JamesMGreene> yup
[10:31:33] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: make sure to refer to the target repo
[10:31:57] <Krinkle> and preferably also make a tag in the new repo so we have a stable tag to work from (the version last in the qunit repo)
[10:31:57] <JamesMGreene> Sure, I'll find your similar commit for the JUnit one and just mimic that
[10:32:10] <Krinkle> so that people who prefer working only on tags / releases can switch to the new layout immediately
[10:32:11] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/67585c7d98761e835d5361631b327016d0db6517
[10:32:11] <b-ot> Krinkle: Timo Tijhof (3w 5d ago): Moved 'addons/junitlogger' to 'jquery/qunit-reporter-junit.git'.  Tree: https://github.com/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit/tree/v1.0.0
[10:32:15] <Krinkle> Yeah
[10:32:36] <JamesMGreene> Did you also update the qunitjs.com site?
[10:32:44] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: How are you on the new repo for composite? What did you/we settle on for the approach? Local sample tests?
[10:32:58] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: I don't know, I don't update that as much as I should.
[10:33:00] <JamesMGreene> Starting with just a straight port
[10:33:00] <Krinkle> Probably not.
[10:33:08] <JamesMGreene> but then replacing with unit tests later
[10:33:53] <JamesMGreene> I've been thinking about having a suites that will run on both file system and HTTP, and then another suite that will fail on file system but pass on HTTP
[10:34:11] <JamesMGreene> But that last bit is the edge case of having a "../otherSuite.html" kind of reference
[10:34:27] <JamesMGreene> so low priority compared to the core unit tests
[10:35:09] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: It's a shame you had to make a custom qunit Grunt task for qunit-reporter-junit but I understand the need :(
[10:38:45] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene Krinkle: Would be great if one of you could send a PR for the site to update the references to the two plugins. I can take care of updating jquery-wp-content to rename Add-ons to Plugins
[10:39:57] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, I don't have write rights to qunitjs.com yet.
[10:40:04] <Krinkle> Should I?
[10:40:43] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I see you've been triaging jquery/qunit/issues. Lots of unread notifications from 1-2 hours ago.
[10:41:03] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I find myself also doing that every few weeks. Perhaps something we could do together during the bi-weekly meeting?
[10:41:07] <Krinkle> Might be more efficient
[10:41:09] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: mostly gathering CLA signatures
[10:41:23] <jzaefferer> not really anything else
[10:41:31] <jzaefferer> but yeah, some coop triage would be good
[10:41:46] <jzaefferer> though just working on issues would probably be more productive
[10:41:51] <Krinkle> ok, maybe this triage was mostly on commits. But yeah, I mean in general.
[10:41:55] <Krinkle> Of course :)
[10:42:46] <jzaefferer> as for write rights on qunitjs.com: I can hand that out, sure. Not sure about jquery-wp-content though, since that generally affects all sites
[10:42:49] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: Does this work? https://github.com/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit/blob/0e9b4150e16631e911fbca9a6c98e8344a7f9757/Gruntfile.js#L16-L22
[10:43:06] <JamesMGreene> I thought all those had to be in an `options` object?
[10:43:17] <JamesMGreene> per their docs
[10:43:34] <JamesMGreene> (the port, hostname, base)
[10:44:03] <JamesMGreene> Since those are the default values anyway it should still be working but I think your values would be ignored...?
[10:44:18] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: I'm not sure what you mean
[10:44:27] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: node-connect only works as a multi-task
[10:44:29] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene Krinkle: You got write access for both API sites now. Let me know when you make changes in master. Can review on stage, before we tag to deploy to live
[10:44:44] <Krinkle> it needs to have a level between "connect": and the actual options
[10:44:44] <JamesMGreene> i.e. compare to: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect#basic-use
[10:44:50] <Krinkle> so I named the level "server"
[10:45:04] <JamesMGreene> Right but the Object.keys under "server" will be ignored, AFAIK
[10:45:13] <JamesMGreene> because it is only expecting an "options" key
[10:45:24] <Krinkle> e.g. "grunt connect" -> "grunt connect:*" -> "grunt connect:server"
[10:45:36] <Krinkle> afaik this is how other projects do it also
[10:45:40] <JamesMGreene> I'm not talking about the multi-task bit
[10:45:44] <JamesMGreene> just the options
[10:45:53] <Krinkle> yes I'm aware they are the defaults, but I choose to hardcode some of the defaults. namely the options I rely on
[10:45:54] <JamesMGreene> Have you ever set it to anything other than those 3 default values? :)
[10:46:02] <JamesMGreene> like a different port?
[10:46:08] <JamesMGreene> Just curious if it _works_
[10:46:17] <Krinkle> (host, port, base) I'm referring to http://localhost:8000/test  later on 
[10:46:24] <JamesMGreene> Right
[10:46:25] <Krinkle> Yes
[10:46:30] <JamesMGreene> Huh, OK
[10:46:30] <Krinkle> I tried port 9001 at some point
[10:46:36] * JamesMGreene shrugs
[10:46:36] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[10:46:44] <JamesMGreene> Must be an undocumented thing thebnb
[10:46:45] <JamesMGreene> then
[10:46:50] <Krinkle> But feel free to clone the repo, change the port and the url and see if it still works
[10:47:48] <JamesMGreene> yeah, maybe later
[10:53:19] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: Using that `connect` config you have didn't work for me
[10:53:23] <JamesMGreene> i.e. it ignored the port, etc.
[10:53:36] <JamesMGreene> Adding the `options` object around it fixes it
[10:54:05] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: It seems lame
[10:54:15] <JamesMGreene> Agreed
[10:54:17] <Krinkle> there is only one documented property: options
[10:54:22] <Krinkle> ugh
[10:54:23] <Krinkle> https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-connect
[10:54:24] <Krinkle> Thanks :)
[10:54:33] <JamesMGreene> yup, np
[10:56:04] <JamesMGreene> lol, now you've done it jzaefferer
[10:56:24] <jzaefferer> done what?
[10:56:31] <JamesMGreene> The version of the jquery.org site they branched when making the new one still has my mispelled last name on it :-P
[10:56:43] <jzaefferer> ugh
[10:57:01] <JamesMGreene> lol
[10:57:04] * JamesMGreene is submitting a PR
[10:57:50] <jzaefferer> don't bother
[10:58:49] <JamesMGreene> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/pull/43
[10:58:49] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: Pull request #43 by JamesMGreene (12s ago): Fixed the spelling of "Greene".
[10:58:54] <JamesMGreene> oh, sorry, too late :-P
[10:59:09] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/commit/45cf6f050abb1ee6f600a279be42bc7ddf6c5f6d
[10:59:09] <b-ot> jzaefferer: JÃ¶rn Zaefferer (49s ago): Fix James' lastname
[10:59:55] <JamesMGreene> thanks
[11:02:00] <JamesMGreene> Hmm
[11:02:56] <JamesMGreene> So I guess QUnit Composite now relies on QUnit core master
[11:03:11] <JamesMGreene> because we added a reference to the newly exposed `QUnit.addClass`
[11:03:28] <Krinkle> Indeed
[11:03:33] <Krinkle> btw, I figured out why it needs .options
[11:03:35] <JamesMGreene> So either I need to declare that version of QUnit as a dependency, or else remove the use of that function...?
[11:03:41] <Krinkle> It isn't in the grunt-contrib-connect code
[11:03:46] <Krinkle> it's a grunt thing in general
[11:03:59] <Krinkle> multi-task tasks need the options property
[11:04:00] <JamesMGreene> Well yeah, I figured it was Grunt since all tasks have that `options` element
[11:04:07] <JamesMGreene> er, property, yes
[11:04:14] <JamesMGreene> Keep wanting to say 'element' today
[11:06:37] <JamesMGreene> So, recommendation? Add dependency of QUnit 1.12 or remove use of that exposed func?
[11:07:34] <JamesMGreene> (or make it a fallback, of course)
[11:08:41] <Krinkle> 1.12 can't be depend on yet, npm wouldn't take it I think
[11:11:00] <JamesMGreene> True
[11:11:13] <JamesMGreene> So I guess I remove it or make it a fallback
[11:11:23] <JamesMGreene> Any preference?
[11:11:40] <JamesMGreene> Maybe fallback just for the visual cue to clean it up later
[13:27:20] <JamesMGreene> Have you guys ever seen any good blog posts, articles, etc. explaining the JS event loop (or asynchrony in general) that would be good for beginners?
[13:27:28] <JamesMGreene> I can't seem to find any to share with them
[13:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> Beginners for node or browser?
[13:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure reading about event loops is useful for beginners writing browser code.
[13:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> You'd just want an article about event-driven programming.
[13:53:01] <JamesMGreene> Hmm, still not finding great resources on that either
[13:53:27] <JamesMGreene> And it is for the browser, yes
[13:53:55] <JamesMGreene> I mentioned the event loop as it relates to timers, etc.
[13:54:12] <JamesMGreene> As well as async callbacks, etc.
[14:01:18] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, it's relevant, I just think it's ok for things to be black boxes.
[14:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> Especially for beginners.
[14:05:46] <JamesMGreene> OK, let's call them novices that know a little but aren't understanding why they can't check the return value of an asynchronous callback synchronously
[14:05:55] <JamesMGreene> :)

[14:07:02] <snover> thanks everyboty
[14:07:51] <DaveMethvin> hey snover .. q for ya ... is dojo 1.8 really the last before 2.0?
[14:07:57] <snover> no, 1.9
[14:08:03] <snover> due april
[14:08:08] <DaveMethvin> ok
[14:08:22] <snover> there will probably be a 1.10 too but it will probably only be whatever ibm manage to cobble together
[14:08:40] <snover> as long as there are clients willing to pay for future releases of the 1.x branch basically
[14:08:43] <scott_gonzalez> So 1.10 will be a broken 1.9?
[14:08:50] <snover> :)) you got it
[14:08:59] <DaveMethvin> wait, we'll do it first!
[14:19:46] <JamesMGreene> At long last: https://github.com/jquery/qunit-composite

[14:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Hopping on a train?
[15:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Do you have a wsh environment?
[15:01:55] <DaveMethvin> wsh meaning windows script host?
[15:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[15:02:07] <DaveMethvin> yes
[15:02:15] <scott_gonzalez> Can you test something for me?
[15:02:18] <DaveMethvin> sure
[15:02:46] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: on my way
[15:02:52] <mikesherov> should be at my house by 6:45
[15:03:13] <DaveMethvin> oh that's right scott_gonzalez is in a new york state of mind
[15:04:01] <scott_gonzalez> I am :-)
[15:04:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, just to make this as complicated as possible for you...
[15:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> Clone https://github.com/scottgonzalez/csslint and checkout jsonrc
[15:04:48] <DaveMethvin> k brb
[15:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> Clone https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui and checkout csslintrc-json
[15:05:15] <DaveMethvin> k even more brb
[15:06:30] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, do you have ant?
[15:06:35] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[15:06:37] <DaveMethvin> :D
[15:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> I can probably just give you the built file.
[15:06:58] <DaveMethvin> no but i have about 5 different versions of grunt
[15:07:02] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it has any dependencies.
[15:07:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'll take that
[15:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/5191248
[15:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> So now you'll only need the jquery-ui clone.
[15:07:53] <DaveMethvin> awesome
[15:08:52] <DaveMethvin> damn that's a big repo
[15:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> we writez lotz of codez
[15:13:05] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Did you eat aleady?
[15:13:09] <DaveMethvin> okay, repo pulled down, npm installed, and copied the csslint-wsh.js file to root ... what now? 
[15:13:42] <scott_gonzalez> You're on the csslintrc-json branch?
[15:14:04] <DaveMethvin> yes
[15:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> From the root of the jquery-ui checkout, run csslint-wsh.js themes/base/jquery.ui.core.css
[15:14:15] <scott_gonzalez> However you invoke that in wsh.
[15:14:26] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: no, want to order some chinese or something?
[15:14:31] <mikesherov> OFF TOPIC
[15:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Sure. I was going to grab something quick on my way, but Chinese sounds delicious :-)
[15:14:59] <scott_gonzalez> Then I realized if I needed to get food, you probably did too...
[15:15:07] <mikesherov> yeah, the delivery comes in like 8 minutes when we order
[15:15:10] <mikesherov> they are like lightning
[15:15:29] <scott_gonzalez> Cool, so we'll order when I get there.
[15:15:36] <mikesherov> yup
[15:15:45] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#option-refreshPositions
[15:15:55] <mikesherov> this says recalc droppables on every drag
[15:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, sssllllloooowwwww
[15:16:12] <mikesherov> I wonder if that should also recalc other draggable positions
[15:16:17] <mikesherov> I know it's slow
[15:16:31] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, it's being replaced by a refresh method, which will recalc EVERYTHING
[15:16:32] <mikesherov> but at least it gives us an escape valve for bugs of the type of:
[15:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> But only on demand.
[15:16:36] <DaveMethvin> c:\wamp\www\jquery-ui\csslint-wsh.js(9296, 13) Microsoft JScript runtime error:
[15:16:36] <DaveMethvin> Object doesn't support this property or method
[15:16:42] <mikesherov> sure, on demand
[15:17:00] <mikesherov> by "recalc everything", you mean all droppable and other draggables?
[15:17:28] <DaveMethvin> it didn't like the path, let me try something simpler
[15:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> All activated droppables and all draggable options (like containment)
[15:18:28] <mikesherov> ok, so until then, can I make refreshPositions do the same for other draggables?
[15:18:59] <mikesherov> the reason I ask is that there are a slew of bugs of the type: "I did something to some element after 'start' and the drag doesn't recognize it.
[15:19:19] <mikesherov> or do you think tnat's investing in a dead API?
[15:20:07] <scott_gonzalez> By "other draggables" you mean options on the currently active draggable or actually other draggables?
[15:20:49] <mikesherov> actually other draggables
[15:20:55] <mikesherov> like for example, the "snap" method
[15:21:21] <mikesherov> there was a bug that was like "I removed the other draggable after start, and now it's snapping to a non-existent thing"
[15:21:41] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I'm thinking of that as options on the current draggable.
[15:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> I think updating snap in refreshPositions is fine.
[15:22:17] <mikesherov> and so I fixed it by checking for document presence every time it was supposed to snap
[15:22:30] <mikesherov> right, can I do the same for containment?
[15:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> Sure.
[15:23:35] <scott_gonzalez> The performance hit for containment shouldn't be much different from just having 1 more active droppable on the page, right?
[15:24:02] <mikesherov> well, I don't even think it's an issue for containment
[15:24:51] <mikesherov> I just meant that if I see any issue of the form "something is only updating on start but not drag", I can solve it by making the dynamic refresh part of refreshPositions and call it a day
[15:25:07] <mikesherov> and that you're cool with that as a generic strategy
[15:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I don't really want to be telling people they have to enable a potentially very slow operation for what should be a simple fix.
[15:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go clean my car off. I'll see you in a bit.
[15:28:42] <mikesherov> see ya
[15:29:37] <DaveMethvin> ?tell scott_gonzalez doesn't look like the Array object has .map in wsh which is a bit of a surprise
[15:29:37] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Iâ€™ll tell scott_gonzalez about that.
[15:29:38] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, Okay.
[15:31:53] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Ok, that's annoying, since it's unrelated to my change.
[15:31:53] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: You have 1 new message (and 1 unread), use `read when you wish to read it.
[15:31:53] <bot-t> (2 mins 16 secs ago) <DaveMethvin> tell scott_gonzalez doesn't look like the Array object has .map in wsh which is a bit of a surprise
[15:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[15:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> `read
[15:31:58] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: From ryanneufeld, 4d 6h ago: I'm gonna take a look at this, https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/159 but I don't know what change you made.
[15:32:03] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: From DaveMethvin, 2m 21s ago: doesn't look like the Array object has .map in wsh which is a bit of a surprise
[15:32:18] <ryanneufeld> haha scott_gonzalez that one is way old
[15:32:41] <DaveMethvin> so yeah a couple of things there
[15:32:55] <DaveMethvin> one is that the arguments "array" is not an Array
[15:33:00] <DaveMethvin> so it doesn't have .map
[15:33:05] <DaveMethvin> but even when i make it a real Array
[15:33:09] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't have .map
[15:34:37] <DaveMethvin> after i get past that one it complains about .forEach
[15:34:49] <DaveMethvin> and this is windows 8
[15:35:10] <DaveMethvin> so it looks like they didn't update the platform's JScript to match the js in IE10 :(
[15:36:40] <DaveMethvin> waitaminit, i don't understand this
[15:36:58] <DaveMethvin> they are shimming this functionality and it isn't shimming for some reason
[15:37:07] <DaveMethvin> anyway i gotta go
[15:55:23] <JamesMGreene> rwaldron I'm making a .mailmap file for QUnit
[15:55:52] <JamesMGreene> You show up as "Rick Waldron waldron.rick@gmail.com <waldron.rick@gmail.com>". Do you want your email in the name area like that?
[15:57:17] <JamesMGreene> Assuming "no" since you show up in the current AUTHORS.txt without that part
[15:57:26] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene if it helps the jquery/jquery/AUTHORS.txt should have everyone's preferred emails on the team
[15:57:53] <JamesMGreene> Not worried about the email, just about the crazy email-in-name-field bit :)
[15:58:11] <DaveMethvin> well that's CLEARLY wrong :D
[15:58:24] * JamesMGreene shrugs
[15:58:24] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[15:58:34] <JamesMGreene> People can put whatever they want, after all :-P
[15:58:56] <JamesMGreene> but I believe the expected format is just "preferred name <email@address>
[15:58:57] <JamesMGreene> "
[15:59:09] <DaveMethvin> well the AUTHORS.txt should be the canonical one, or it should be edited
[15:59:24] <JamesMGreene> right
[15:59:39] <JamesMGreene> Not all QUnit contribs would be in jQuery's AUTHORS.txt, though
[15:59:59] <DaveMethvin> should be in the CLA unless they're team members tho
[16:00:19] <DaveMethvin> did I send you a link to the CLA spreadsheet?
[16:00:53] <DaveMethvin> sharing list says i did
[16:01:49] <JamesMGreene> yes
[16:01:52] <JamesMGreene> I'm looking through it
[16:01:57] <JamesMGreene> QUnit is missing a lot :-\
[16:02:06] <DaveMethvin> so much FUN doing bookkeeping
[16:02:07] <JamesMGreene> though jzaefferer contacted ~12 today
[16:02:40] <DaveMethvin> yes, have them sign the documents in triplicate and return the goldenrod copy, be sure to use carbon paper :D
[16:03:55] <JamesMGreene> So when I run into those who haven't signed it, how best to track them down?
[16:04:05] <JamesMGreene> I'm assuming I can search the git logs by email or something, right?
[16:04:09] <DaveMethvin> right
[16:04:22] <rwaldron> JamesMGreene I don't know what that is
[16:04:29] <rwaldron> use your best judgement
[16:04:43] <JamesMGreene> rwaldron: indeed, already gotcha covered
[16:04:48] <DaveMethvin> wow he NEVER says that to me JamesMGreene
[16:04:49] <DaveMethvin> :D
[16:04:52] <JamesMGreene> Here's a fun one:   "unknown <Sergii@.(none)>"
[16:05:06] <JamesMGreene> Perhaps he is giving my judgement the benefit of the doubt...?
[16:05:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah that one will be fun, maybe jzaefferer knows who sergii is
[16:05:32] <JamesMGreene> There is a Sergii in the CLA
[16:05:38] <JamesMGreene> but obviously not that matches that email
[16:05:44] <DaveMethvin> that's a good sign tho
[16:05:45] <JamesMGreene> Sergii Kliuchnyk <sergiikliuchnyk@gmail.com>
[16:06:14] <DaveMethvin> check his github acct and see if he has a fork of qunit
[16:06:23] <DaveMethvin> that might give you a hint if it's the right one at least
[16:11:04] <JamesMGreene> Sooooo
[16:11:23] <JamesMGreene> What about people like paul_irish?
[16:11:30] <JamesMGreene> He's not on the CLA list....
[16:11:41] <DaveMethvin> it's people like him who give the internet a bad name
[16:11:45] <DaveMethvin> oh you mean shoudl  he sign?
[16:12:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah we shoudl prolly get paul_irish to sign
[16:12:06] <paul_irish> k
[16:12:23] <paul_irish> ez pz. where do i go
[16:12:32] <DaveMethvin> contribute.jquery.org/CLA
[16:13:24] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene you signed the CLA right? we shoudl have you sign a CAA in Portland
[16:13:47] <DaveMethvin> since you're a team member now
[16:13:55] <DaveMethvin> and you have to sign it in blood
[16:13:59] <DaveMethvin> ok that last part isn't true
[16:14:06] <DaveMethvin> although...
[16:14:20] <JamesMGreene> What's a CAA?
[16:14:30] <JamesMGreene> Sounds very top-secret
[16:14:34] <DaveMethvin> it's an *assignment*
[16:14:49] <DaveMethvin> so instead of licensing us the content you assign it to us (the jQuery Foundataion)
[16:15:17] <DaveMethvin> so if someone sued because of the code we'd have legal standing to defend
[16:15:25] <DaveMethvin> all that legalistic stuff
[16:15:44] <DaveMethvin> one day Oracle will claim that Google stole it from them
[16:15:45] <paul_irish> did yall hook up CLA to commit status API yet
[16:15:49] <paul_irish> or waiting for clahub
[16:16:02] <DaveMethvin> haven't hooked it up yet
[16:16:10] <DaveMethvin> that did look nice tho
[16:16:36] <paul_irish> ya
[16:18:29] <JamesMGreene> Great scott! Christopher Lloyd is a QUnit contrib
[16:19:24] * Krinkle 's irc notification bubble only showed "Great scott!" and hoped it would be a BTTF reference instead of scott_gonzalez, and indeed. It it!
[16:19:44] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Too bad it's not the actor, but awesome nonetheless.
[16:20:26] <Krinkle> No disrespect scott_gonzalez, you're awesome too :) But it'd be phrased "Great, Scott!" in that case.
[16:20:47] <DaveMethvin> see, punctuation is important
[16:21:10] <DaveMethvin> like "Krinkle: should be fixed"
[16:21:20] <DaveMethvin> instead of "Krinkle should be fixed"
[16:21:22] <Krinkle> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rlBfnqgnhzw
[16:21:28] <Krinkle> Let's eat grandpa
[16:21:57] <Krinkle> http://www.vappingo.com/word-blog/the-importance-of-punctuation/
[16:21:58] <Krinkle> etc.
[16:22:08] <Krinkle> all the stuff
[16:25:12] <JamesMGreene> Is there any Grunt flag to make it not output the stuff like the following?  [4mRunning "authors" task[24m
[16:27:12] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene not that i know of, if the code says grunt.verbose.log (or .error etc) then you can turn them ON with --verbose
[16:28:07] <JamesMGreene> bummer
[16:28:29] <JamesMGreene> annoying to have to kill the head and tail of the AUTHORS file every time
[16:31:04] <JamesMGreene> So we should be using the contributors' preferred emails vs. just the ones they signed the CLA with, yes?
[16:31:29] <DaveMethvin> well they were supposed to sign the CLA with their preferrred email...
[16:31:34] <JamesMGreene> lol
[17:02:06] <_JamesMGreene> "JZA <JZA@JZA-R60>"  <-- Anyone?
[17:02:10] <_JamesMGreene> Is that jzaefferer?
[17:31:04] <_JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: "JZA <JZA@JZA-R60>"  <-- That you?
[17:36:41] <_JamesMGreene> Looks like jaffa hasn't signed the CLA yet either
[17:36:43] <_JamesMGreene> d'oh
[17:37:01] <_JamesMGreene> Those Google dudes are trouble!

[18:26:43] <Krinkle> JamesMGreeneAway: Wording is still addon there?
[18:26:56] <Krinkle> I thought you wanted to update that to plugin.
[18:54:55] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov's brain is about to explode
[18:57:13] <JamesMGreeneAway> Krinkle|detached: Yes but I wasn't so sure that this commit was the right time for it
[18:57:24] <JamesMGreeneAway> happy to do it if desired, though
[18:58:00] <JamesMGreeneAway> I'm not familiar with the qunitjs.com repo and it clearly has some build magic involved since the HTML I edited wasn't a full HTML doc :)
[18:58:10] <JamesMGreeneAway> but the page itself needs to be renamed

[21:33:32] <JamesMGreene> Soooo should I _not_ merge PRs until the contributor signs the CLA?
[21:35:12] <JamesMGreene> gseguin, any knowledge on that? ^
[21:38:26] * JamesMGreene shouts "ECHO ECHo ECho Echo echo..."
[21:40:02] <snover> JamesMGreene: really, you shouldnâ€™t even be looking at them until then
[21:42:52] <JamesMGreene> Figured. Crappity crap crap
[21:43:06] <JamesMGreene> Well, I didn't push it upstream
[21:43:10] <JamesMGreene> Just to my fork
[21:44:28] <JamesMGreene> Bah
[21:44:39] <JamesMGreene> Well, there you go, I can only merge 1 PR tonight after all

[22:50:07] <JamesMGreene> mfer
[22:50:38] <JamesMGreene> gseguin|away gnarf jzaefferer How are we going to get that memory limitation issue fixed on the Jenkins server?
[22:51:01] <JamesMGreene> (that is causing PhantomJS crashes, e.g. http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/275/console )
[22:51:34] <doesallmagic> Project QUnit build #275: SUCCESS in 1 min 52 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/275/
[22:51:35] <doesallmagic> James M. Greene: Attempting to reenable the logs and step unit tests.
[22:54:20] <JamesMGreene> Commentary: Well, the 'logs' tests passed on PhantomJS+Jenkins but we didn't make it to the 'step' tests before PhantomJS crashed w/o memory
[22:55:28] <JamesMGreene> It also looks like the 'logs' tests are NOT a part of the TestSwarm config (which is only running 'index' and 'async' tests) but I have no idea where to change that.
