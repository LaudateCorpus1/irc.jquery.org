[07:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> Always run the `selector =` (also gives us consistency of doc vs. document)
[07:35:23] <scott_gonzalez> Then do the if with the attr call.
[07:39:04] <mikesherov> .
[07:53:49] <gibson042> scott_gonzalez: it's that way now to support two different signatures (html+ownerDocument vs. html+props)
[07:54:07] <gibson042> but could probably be reduced anyway

[08:03:42] <mikesherov> rwaldron: just testing grunt on a mac, and I had to manually do a `git submodule update --init` before grunting when I did a fresh checkout of the repo. Don't know if that's expected.
[08:06:03] <rwaldron> mikesherov i know.
[08:06:14] <mikesherov> OK, cool
[08:06:19] <rwaldron> i haven't ported any of the git submodule stuff
[08:06:22] <rwaldron> at all.
[08:06:27] <mikesherov> k
[08:06:41] <rwaldron> there are 3 major pieces
[08:07:03] <rwaldron> 1) build process. 2) git stuff. 3) release(?)
[08:07:13] <rwaldron> Right now we're at 1
[08:07:17] <rwaldron> for testing and such
[08:09:58] <mikesherov> cool.
[08:10:11] <mikesherov> I like grunt so far, it's nice
[08:10:33] <mikesherov> grunt-compare-size is neat the way it caches the delta against master

[08:43:10] <mikesherov> rwaldron: good catch
[09:16:22] <danzik17> mikesherov: keep meaning to test this real quick, but if you want to since you're touching this file anyway, https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/blob/71bb0796aed08d388d00c32169934847c9173c66/src/core.js#L421 can probably be changed to rootjQuery for another byte or two ...
[09:19:46] <mikesherov> danzik17: I'm in the middle of something else at the moment. I can check for you in a bit
[09:29:39] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: That code can't be reduced. There's a difference between doc and document :-/
[09:30:27] <gibson042> I know
[09:30:35] <gibson042> I was thinking you might redefine doc
[09:31:06] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if it'd save anything if we had to write that code.
[09:31:33] <gibson042> it'd be small either way
[09:32:01] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..may have something
[09:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> doc = ( context && context.nodeType ? context.ownerDocument || context : document );
[09:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> Adding context.nodeType check
[09:32:28] <gibson042> yeah
[09:32:42] <gibson042> exactly
[09:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> compare_size always compares to master, right?
[09:35:47] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez, it's easy fix
[09:36:08] <mikesherov> just go into the grunt-compare-size source and change to "1.8pre"
[09:36:15] <mikesherov> then checkout 1.8pre, run size
[09:36:21] <mikesherov> then go back to branch and run again

[14:10:23] <mikesherov> I told him I'd help him make it small, but only if the rest of the team, or DaveMethvin, gave it the go-ahead
[14:10:35] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: clarkbox scott_gonzalez https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/Continuous-integration:-Next
[14:10:42] <mikesherov> I just don't want to give someone false hope on a pull request
[16:37:20] <johnbender> here's a random question for one of the core team members, do you guys have a count on the number of iterative jQuery.fn methods?
[16:38:02] <johnbender> they seem to fall into two categories - those that manipulate the first element and those that manipulate all the elemens
[16:38:05] <johnbender> *elements
[16:41:02] <johnbender> otherwise I'm curious if it's accurate to say that those methods would rely on a for loop, each, map, or access?
[16:41:13] <johnbender> I can try to do some grep-fu based on that
[17:55:39] <Krinkle> johnbender: yes, how else?
[17:56:24] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: In general, it's getters that work on the first element.
[17:56:25] <Krinkle> The ones for multiple elements either use a for ( i; len; ) loop on the jQuery collection, or .domManip()  / each() or access()
[17:57:08] <scott_gonzalez> Are there cases of non-getters that only work on one element?
[18:02:10] <Krinkle> potential non-getters that I could find by looking at bit.ly/jqsource and searching for [0]: triggerHandler
[18:02:11] <Krinkle> that's all
[18:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> triggerHandler is a getter :-)
[18:02:41] <Krinkle> Yeah
[18:03:29] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: any word from browserstack yet? Haven't' heard back yet on raising the limit
[18:03:29] <johnbender> Krinkle: nice! I'll add those to my list
[18:03:31] <Krinkle> it appears the limit is 3
[18:03:45] <Krinkle> instead of 4
[18:03:49] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: Krinkle: thanks to both of you :D
[18:03:53] <Krinkle> I used to think it was 4, but now I'm thinking it is 3
[18:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's definitely 4.
[18:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sitting here watching 4 browsers run in parallel.
[18:04:16] <Krinkle> I've never seen more than 3 (not counting ghost workers that are no longer showing up in  /workers)
[18:04:25] <Krinkle> really?
[18:04:34] <Krinkle> I see 3: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/browserstack
[18:04:35] <Krinkle> now 2
[18:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> I just watched Chrome, Firefox, IE6, IE7 run.
[18:04:44] <Krinkle> ok
[18:04:50] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we don't have 4 browsers that need to run right now.
[18:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> IE6 isn't doing anything right now BTW
[18:05:13] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/37
[18:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what I'm watching.
[18:05:31] <Krinkle> IE6 might have crashed
[18:05:38] <scott_gonzalez> piece of shit
[18:05:47] <Krinkle> in that case it'll time out in 2 minutes
[18:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> It sat on tabs deprecated forever then just disappeared.
[18:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> Any idea why IE8 isn't running yet?
[18:06:04] <Krinkle> after that the testswarm-browerstack cron will see that IE6 has a worker but now in the swam and kill it and spawn a new one
[18:06:07] <Krinkle> no idea
[18:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> There it goes.
[18:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> IE6 + IE8
[18:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> cron must've just run.
[18:06:35] <Krinkle> started browser:  { name: 'ie', version: '8.0' } { id: 17191 }
[18:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> Let's see if it finishes this time.
[18:06:41] <Krinkle> yeah, it is being started each time
[18:06:45] <Krinkle> ah, there it s
[18:07:00] <Krinkle> exactly 5 minutes left
[18:07:09] <Krinkle> IE6 won't make it probably
[18:07:21] <Krinkle> but if it would do concurrent workers, it'll make it for use
[18:07:22] <Krinkle> sure*
[18:07:27] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like IE6 isn't running the new tests.
[18:07:36] <scott_gonzalez> Tabs deprecated shouldn't be spinning anymore.
[18:07:38] <Krinkle> because by now it could be having 2 workers for IE6
[18:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> I realize that's not really possible.
[18:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> WOOHOO
[18:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> It finished
[18:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> But there's no way it'll run all of the other tests in time.
[18:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[18:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> IE7 on accordion
[18:08:30] <Krinkle> what did?
[18:08:33] <Krinkle> oh
[18:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> Tabs deprecated in IE6.
[18:09:09] <Krinkle> let's not give status updates for each run in each browser :P
[18:09:33] <scott_gonzalez> Tabs deprecated in IE6/7 was the only remaining failure.
[18:09:40] <Krinkle> Hm..
[18:09:42] <Krinkle> you;re right
