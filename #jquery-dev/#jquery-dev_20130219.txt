[08:35:08] <rwaldron> Krinkle ... 0_o that PR...
[08:35:36] <Krinkle> yeah
[08:35:46] <Krinkle> rwaldron: Your comment phrases it nicer, revoked mine.
[08:35:51] <rwaldron> hahahaha
[08:35:56] <rwaldron> but you were still on point
[08:36:03] <rwaldron> I had to rewrite my response a few times
[08:37:03] <Krinkle> Ah, so you did see it
[08:37:10] <Krinkle> Right, real-time thin
[08:37:11] <Krinkle> nice
[08:37:29] <Krinkle> I edited mine a bit after, not sure whether you saw that version
[08:37:42] <Krinkle> afaik github real-time thing only drags in initial additions, not modifications
[08:37:43] <Krinkle> oh well
[08:37:45] <Krinkle> moving on :)
[08:38:01] <Krinkle> rwaldron: Do you know anything about splunk license issue we're having?
[08:38:08] <Krinkle> It is expired and I can't see anything now
[08:38:10] <rwaldron> Krinkle no idea, sorry
[08:38:11] <Krinkle> blind
[11:19:57] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle: If I separate out those addons into their own repos, should I also apply my PR for QUnit Composite to the new repo instead of waiting for it to be applied to the existing repo? If so, I'd plan to apply it as patches after the initial commit.
[11:20:35] <Krinkle> Under which account are those repos created?
[11:21:01] <Krinkle> It doesn't really matter, but lets avoid untracked code changes  between migration
[11:27:09] <JamesMGreene> The plan from jzaefferer was that I would create them under my personal account WITHOUT preserving the history, and then I'll be added to the jQuery org's QUnit team so that the addon repos can transfer in and be "official" again
[11:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: That's not what he means.
[11:27:52] <JamesMGreene> Hmm?
[11:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> He means the first commit in the new repo should have exactly the same code as what's in the existing repo.
[11:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> In terms of the source for the extension.
[11:28:10] <JamesMGreene> Oh, yes, understood
[11:28:16] <JamesMGreene> and agreed
[11:28:34] <JamesMGreene> Mine was more of an answer to just Krinkle's first question
[11:28:56] <JamesMGreene> We're on the same page :)
[11:29:04] <Krinkle> :)
[11:30:09] <JamesMGreene> Not 100% positive if I'll get through all of them this week, leaving for vacation on Friday
[11:30:15] <JamesMGreene> I'll see what I can do, though
[11:30:45] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: What exactly is the state if you getting access? As far as I'm concerned the repo's could be created right now.
[11:31:08] <Krinkle> Even without you having access
[11:31:25] <Krinkle> I mean, I can create the repo right now
[11:34:47] <JamesMGreene> I'm not 100% positive. Last message from jzaefferer on the subject was "JamesMGreene: you are inbound to getting write access to the QUnit repo anyway"
[11:35:06] <JamesMGreene> Not sure if there was some other unknown rite of passage I have to conquery first ;)
[11:35:34] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: The contributor license agreement, but you cleared that already?
[11:35:35] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: Nothing stopping you/me from creating the repos
[11:35:44] <JamesMGreene> Yup, signed that a few weeks back
[11:35:59] <Krinkle> http://contribute.jquery.org/
[11:36:01] <Krinkle> Ok
[11:36:42] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Settled on a naming scheme?
[11:36:49] <Krinkle> thinking qunit-addon-{name}
[11:36:50] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer just says the addons are not high priority to QUnit at the moment, so he didn't want to use up any effort on it right now. I told him the addons are actually high priority to ME right now, so I'd be happy to tackle it
[11:36:54] <Krinkle> or qunit-contrib-{name}
[11:37:00] <JamesMGreene> Hmm
[11:37:09] <JamesMGreene> We didn't talk about it too much
[11:37:19] <JamesMGreene> The HTML one that I split off is qunit-assert-html
[11:37:31] <JamesMGreene> Tried to make it clear what TYPE of addon it was
[11:37:38] <Krinkle> I'm considering to create them under jquery/* right now, then have you do your thing over PRs until you have access. PRs don't need access, can be done anywhere :)
[11:37:40] <JamesMGreene> since I am also making qunit-reporter-xunit
[11:38:06] <JamesMGreene> yeah but that makes it easier for jzaefferer to not grant me access as soon  ;)
[11:38:26] <Krinkle> Right, I think -contrib- would be a better separator so that it doesn't get too specific about what it is extending/providing (assertion methods, reporter, tests, addon etc.)
[11:38:48] <JamesMGreene> I'm on the fence
[11:38:51] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Well, I'm not trying to encourage delay, rather the opposite, as right now you're holding back.
[11:38:59] <Krinkle> :)
[11:39:12] * JamesMGreene shrugs
[11:39:12] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[11:39:19] <Krinkle> :)
[11:39:20] <JamesMGreene> I've been very busy
[11:39:35] <JamesMGreene> But yeah, I could've pushed some more Composite/JUnitLogger changes by now
[11:39:36] <Krinkle> Woudl be consistent with the naming of grunt plugins
[11:39:57] <JamesMGreene> So let's talk through the existing bundled addons
[11:40:16] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: How so? PRs can stack up, right? What exactly are you waiting for? It's not dependency related,right? More to ensure the code is right before basing on it.
[11:40:47] <Krinkle> Just thought of another type of plugin: theme
[11:41:06] <JamesMGreene> qunit-contrib-canvas, qunit-contrib-close-enough, qunit-contrib-composite, qunit-contrib-junitlogger, qunit-contrib-phantomjs, qunit-contrib-step, qunit-contrib-themes
[11:41:10] <Krinkle> Hm.. maybe we actually want to have the name not be consistent, so that the repo name is more clear.
[11:41:17] <Krinkle> themes wouldn't be 1 repo
[11:41:43] <JamesMGreene> Personally, I think contrib is a bit too generic, though I like the "officialness" of it
[11:42:11] <Krinkle> What if there is a theme and a reporter with the same name?
[11:42:14] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer and I had initially talked about "qunit-reporter-*", "qunit-assert-*" but we didn't flesh it out too much
[11:42:23] <Krinkle> qunit-theme-*
[11:42:26] <Krinkle> right
[11:42:40] <Krinkle> -contrib- could be used as catch all for misc stuff
[11:42:42] <JamesMGreene> There are a lot of extension points for QUnit :)
[11:42:47] <Krinkle> Yep
[11:42:56] <JamesMGreene> (and there will be more, I reckon)
[11:43:11] <Krinkle> some undocumented ones may disappear
[11:43:26] <Krinkle> phantomjs is one that isn't really extending qunit
[11:43:30] <JamesMGreene> yeah
[11:44:05] <Krinkle> it'd be the kind that'd be named "brige" (like "testswarm-browserstack", "qunit-phantomjs")
[11:44:11] <JamesMGreene> Actually, on that note... should we even keep that one?  Last time I submitted a PR for it, you guys (?) were explaining that you'd rather see effort put into grunt-lib-phantomjs instead
[11:44:22] <JamesMGreene> well, grunt-contrib-qunit in particular, I guess
[11:44:22] <Krinkle> Yeah (that was me)
[11:44:31] <Krinkle> Yes
[11:44:57] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: So which do you want to get on first? I'm willing to create a small handful right now
[11:45:23] <JamesMGreene> My top priorities right now are composite and junitlogger (which I would prefer to rename)
[11:45:35] <JamesMGreene> qunit-reporter-junit
[11:45:41] <JamesMGreene> Not sure what to call composite
[11:46:00] <JamesMGreene> It's not an assertion, reporter, theme, bridge, etc.
[11:46:24] <Krinkle> right
[11:46:27] <Krinkle> -contrib- in that case
[11:46:42] <JamesMGreene> Still wish it was part of core :-P
[11:46:51] <JamesMGreene> but scott_gonzalez is firmly opposed to that
[11:47:07] <Krinkle> Yeah, I like modular approach as well.
[11:47:20] <Krinkle> That way you can compose your own environment.
[11:47:45] <JamesMGreene> composite is just a bit tricky as it bastardizes the framework a bit conceptually
[11:47:48] <Krinkle> We probably won't have any other composite-like plugin under jquery/qunit-*, but it gives people choice
[11:47:55] <Krinkle> True
[11:47:58] <Krinkle> Anyway, let's do this
[11:48:42] <Krinkle> I'm pushing initial code in a second.
[11:48:42] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/qunit-contrib-composite
[11:48:53] <JamesMGreene> What are you pushing to it?
[11:49:10] <JamesMGreene> JUST the composite folder, right?
[11:49:17] <Krinkle> current code from qunit and (subset of?) authors file
[11:49:18] <Krinkle> yes
[11:49:20] <Krinkle> single commit
[11:49:23] <JamesMGreene> (and none of its history, structure, etc.)
[11:49:33] <JamesMGreene> OK, sounds good
[11:50:01] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit
[11:50:10] <JamesMGreene> colinclark Are you the same Colin Clark who used to work for Thomson Reuters?
[11:50:33] <colinclark> I'm not, no, JamesMGreene.
[11:50:50] <JamesMGreene> k :)
[11:53:15] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: So should we kill of the PhantomJS addon at this point?
[11:53:38] <Krinkle> I'm not creating a repo for it now. But not going to kill it either.
[11:53:56] <JamesMGreene> OK, well not this minute :)
[11:54:02] <JamesMGreene> But, you know, over the next few months
[11:55:45] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Hm.. composite test isn't trivial
[11:55:49] <Krinkle> It uses other addons :P
[11:56:15] <Krinkle> And qunit itself, naturally
[11:56:26] <Krinkle> will have to get qunit in there
[11:57:06] <JamesMGreene> The composite addon needs real tests
[11:57:12] <JamesMGreene> Not to just run other addon's tests
[11:57:22] <JamesMGreene> That was the easy way out
[11:57:49] <JamesMGreene> It's actually a rather complex addon that is definitely worthy of its own tests
[11:58:03] <JamesMGreene> complex = lots of little edge cases
[11:58:22] <Krinkle> I don't want to use a git submodule to bring in qunit into the test suite of qunit-reporter-junit
[11:58:35] <Krinkle> but npm dependendy doesn't work well because node-qunit doesn't include the css
[11:58:49] <JamesMGreene> What about qunitjs?
[11:58:51] <Krinkle> the nice thing about npm is one can specify "latest" or "1.x"
[11:59:13] <JamesMGreene> (qunitjs as the npm dependency)
[11:59:15] <Krinkle> Oh, that's right. We have our own npm presence now
[11:59:19] <JamesMGreene> Yup :)
[11:59:41] <JamesMGreene> Hooray
[12:00:42] <JamesMGreene> Unrelated tangent: testing Grunt plugins can be really hard :(
[12:05:50] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Are you listed in AUTHORS.txt? I can't find you in there when reducing it for this repo
[12:08:02] <Krinkle> Running `grunt authors` tells me I need to add:
[12:08:02] <Krinkle> James M. Greene <james.m.greene@gmail.com>
[12:08:06] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Looks right?
[12:08:27] <JamesMGreene> yup

[12:52:48] <JamesMGreeneAway> Cool, thanks Krinkle
[12:53:03] <JamesMGreeneAway> Ah, we'll also have to get these upgraded to Grunt 0.4 ;)
[14:17:31] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle If that Composite PR can be merged BEFORE we separate it into its own repo, that would make my life much easier =)
[14:20:45] <Krinkle> I'm not migrating composite yet as its tests aren't standalone yet
[14:21:11] <Krinkle> so there's a pretty good chance the PR will land before it migrates as you may be the one writing those tests (hint hint hint)
[14:23:40] <JamesMGreene> Indeed, I'm planning on it
[14:24:10] <JamesMGreene> Any advice on how to test the testing framework with the testing framework?  I'd imagine qunit/test/test.js would give me a good hint
[14:25:13] <JamesMGreene> I'd assume it's basically something like: add lifecycle logging event handlers that keep track of messages, assertion counts, etc. of all the nested pages and then assert on those things back in the main page...?
[14:27:33] <JamesMGreene> (for composite)
[14:55:04] <kam187-rMBP> hi guys
[14:56:05] <kam187-rMBP> I have a quick question about how page transitions work.  well in what order things happen. 
[14:57:12] <kam187-rMBP> am i right in thinking when u transitions from page A to B, it starts to load B, enhances B transitions out A, transitions in B ?
[15:13:12] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Sounds about right, yeah
[15:13:22] <Krinkle> kam187-rMBP: ?
[15:13:38] <Krinkle> What are you referring to? Are you using a jquery product?
[15:14:00] <Krinkle> (jQuery core, UI, Mobile, ..)
[15:14:09] <kam187-rMBP> yeah jquery + jquerymobile
[15:14:42] <Krinkle> There's probably people here that can help, but there's more of them in #jquery where support issues are usually answered much quicker
[15:15:14] <kam187-rMBP> it's more of a code question i guess.  I'm looking to mod the code for my own particular case
[15:15:46] <kam187-rMBP> basically i'm transitioning from page A to B.  there'a big lag between the click and it moving to page B
[15:16:11] <kam187-rMBP> i can see if i disable enhancment on B this speeds up dramatically.  So what i wanted to do was transition page A out, load and enhance B, then transition page B in
[15:16:44] <kam187-rMBP> i don't mine the use looking at my background during that time, it's better than it looks unresponsive
[15:16:47] <kam187-rMBP> *user
[15:17:03] <Krinkle> Hm..
[15:17:50] <Krinkle> well, I haven't used jquery mobile much. The developers of jQuery Mobile hang out in #jquerymobile-dev though they may be busy. in #jquery are loads of other experts using it everyday that can help you.
[15:18:14] <kam187-rMBP> thanks, i'll try one of those channels :)
[15:18:18] <Krinkle> Good luck.
[15:18:28] <kam187-rMBP> thanks!
[15:22:12] <kam187-rMBP> hmm just had a thought :P  I could just transition to an empty page, then transition to the new page
[15:22:46] <Krinkle> Looks like the devs are awake in  #jquerymobile-dev
[15:23:04] <kam187-rMBP> oh nice
[15:23:28] <Krinkle> if you still want them to look at it (or later), feel free to ping them to read you message in #jquery (they're in there as well I think(
[15:23:46] <Krinkle> brb later
[15:24:22] <kam187-rMBP> ahh cool
