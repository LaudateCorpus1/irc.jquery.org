[04:54:39] <jzaefferer> ?tell Krinkle can you open a PR for issue143 when you're done and leave it open long enough for me to review?
[04:54:40] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[07:32:40] <DaveMethvin> .
[11:02:23] <gnarf> hey DaveMethvin - you have a minute?
[11:02:43] <DaveMethvin> at yer service, gnarf
[11:03:11] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so - I'm debating renaming the jQuery.Tween that I created BACK to jQuery.fx
[11:03:27] <gnarf> and the making all the methods behave like the old jQuery.fx did
[11:03:52] <gnarf> a) it should make it more "back compat" but b) it feels like it might create its own compat issues...
[11:04:05] <DaveMethvin> we kinda sorta expose pieces parts of jQuery.fx, but never have documented it much
[11:04:09] <gnarf> For instance, my "Tween" doesn't have a .show() .hide() or .custom( from, to )
[11:04:11] <DaveMethvin> there was just a ticket abou tthat
[11:04:41] <DaveMethvin> so Tween would need some level of backcompat anyway if you were going to pass it to the callbacks instead
[11:04:51] <gnarf> my "Tween" gets all that information as you set it up, and you are welcome to modify the .startValue .finalValue .unit .easing etc after you make it
[11:05:11] <gnarf> right - fx.step[ * ]( fx )
[11:05:15] <gnarf> takes an fx
[11:05:25] <gnarf> so i was like "damn, i need to map this to an fx"
[11:05:41] <DaveMethvin> alternatively, break shit :D
[11:05:53] <gnarf> so my biggest problem with .fx is the pretty crappy method/property naming
[11:08:17] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/311k0V1R273x350m2h3f
[11:08:29] <gnarf> .start -> .end ... .now
[11:08:48] <gnarf> my current Tween obj doesn't care about time either
[11:08:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah, the "compressed" names are a bit cryptic
[11:09:19] <DaveMethvin> well how much of fx do you think really needs to stay?
[11:09:24] <Krinkle> .
[11:09:24] <bot-t> (6 hours 14 mins ago) <jzaefferer> tell Krinkle can you open a PR for issue143 when you're done and leave it open long enough for me to review?
[11:09:35] <DaveMethvin> basically just what we've documented for ppl to use
[11:09:38] <gnarf> if we want to support fx.step - who knows what people are using from it....
[11:09:49] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[11:10:16] <gnarf> yeh - i mean - someone will be like "i was using startTime cuz i console.log'ed this fx object and it totally had what i needed!
[11:10:36] <DaveMethvin> every refactor has this issue ... sure would be nice to start clean and not have to worry about people "figuring out the code"
[11:10:44] <DaveMethvin> damned "open source"
[11:10:46] <gnarf> heh
[11:11:10] <gnarf> so like - my Tween has a .cur() - i called it .get()
[11:11:38] <DaveMethvin> thing is, i'd bet that very few ppl are using most of that fx stuff but us
[11:11:46] <DaveMethvin> and a few effects plugins
[11:11:49] <gnarf> yeah
[11:12:00] <DaveMethvin> but if you break 3rdparty plugins the people who use them will be totally baffled
[11:12:09] <DaveMethvin> won't understand why/how/what to do
[11:12:22] <Krinkle> ?tell jzaefferer Done :) https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/pull/147 (screenshot of new HomePage: http://i.imgur.com/L4qfL.png )
[11:12:23] <bot-t> Krinkle, Okay.
[11:12:24] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on testswarm by Krinkle (1m, 14s ago): issue143 branch
[11:12:31] <gnarf> I was thinking - mirror the basic properties of the .fx - and .cur() - but the reset get blackholed
[11:12:43] <gnarf> unless I've already written a method for it
[11:13:04] <gnarf> .hide() .show() and .custom() are all "starters" in the jQuery.fx.proto
[11:13:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah...if you stayed with the current names it might save you a few bytes
[11:13:31] <gnarf> i don't like that pattern at all
[11:13:34] <DaveMethvin> lol
[11:13:38] <gnarf> nor do i think anyone is using it
[11:13:52] <gnarf> jQuery.fx is like - create with basics, then call a starter
[11:14:01] <DaveMethvin> only one way to find out if people are using it ...
[11:14:05] <gnarf> Mine is - create with sane defaults, then tweak the props
[11:14:10] <DaveMethvin> and it ain't by asking
[11:14:22] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: wait for the actual release, because we know that people wont test it until then?
[11:14:27] <DaveMethvin> yep
[11:14:48] <gnarf> Every Release makes me make this face :/ <---
[11:14:50] <DaveMethvin> i say we put out something called 1.8 and then a week later say, "Just kidding, we wanted you to really try it"
[11:15:22] <DaveMethvin> the prob with TinyMCE was a classic one, the ppl reporting the problem had no idea what the code did
[11:15:31] <DaveMethvin> nor did any of them make the connection that it was TinyMCE
[11:15:43] <DaveMethvin> DEBUGGER, people
[11:15:57] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you expect our users to press F12?
[11:16:20] <gnarf> have you seen the questions in #jquery lately? :)
[11:16:29] <DaveMethvin> they ain't getting smarter
[11:16:40] <DaveMethvin> i guess that's the problem with making something easy
[11:16:50] <gnarf> "how can I store the value of an input in a temporary variable in jQuery before I submit it to PHP"
[11:16:58] <DaveMethvin> sorry, cannot be done
[11:17:14] <DaveMethvin> that answer will make them go away maybe
[11:17:29] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i mean, going back to using jQuery.fx everywhere will prolly reduce my size a bit
[11:17:32] <gnarf> so im all for it
[11:18:04] <DaveMethvin> sounds good to me; i liked the Tween but backcompat is gonna be hard enough as it is
[11:18:07] <gnarf> not to mention, the ONLY unit test failing is one that tests jQuery.fx.prototype.cur()
[11:18:16] <DaveMethvin> well then you got a fix
[11:18:24] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: jQuery.Tween = jQuery.fx
[11:18:44] <gnarf> and we can deprecate .fx
[11:18:52] <gnarf> so we can some day move to the better name
[11:18:56] <DaveMethvin> yep, let's just hope nobody is doing something too crazy with .fx
[11:19:09] <gnarf> If they are - they will probably love me for .Tween anyway
[11:19:24] <DaveMethvin> true, if they don't mind looking at their code again
[11:19:27] <gnarf> i just hate the methods/props on that proto
[11:19:36] <gnarf> its an ugly object
[11:20:15] <DaveMethvin> in some ways i LIKE breaking really old jQuery code b/c it probably makes bad assumptions anyway
[11:20:27] <DaveMethvin> if it's not being maintained, it's deteriorating
[11:22:02] <DaveMethvin> so gnarf, imma try and land the changes that chad killingsworth made for the closure compiler, they are far-reaching
[11:22:13] <DaveMethvin> most are just to document the interfaces but they touch every file just about
[11:22:17] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/0A3x0D1R0M1J0u2H2l0y
[11:22:43] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: I'm pretty confident in my ability to redo all this work on top of a stable 1.8
[11:22:46] <gnarf> so go for it
[11:23:14] <DaveMethvin> more confident than you are that I can land this beast, especially since I just cleared the PR queue of about 20 requests
[11:23:19] <DaveMethvin> i know it's conflict city for me
[11:23:32] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/311k0V1R273x350m2h3f
[11:23:42] <gnarf> compare those two objects
[11:24:18] * Krinkle installs CloudApp
[11:24:24] <Krinkle> Awesome :)
[11:24:25] <Krinkle> http://cl.ly/3T1a0e0u0O1E220B1g0u
[11:24:26] <DaveMethvin> Tween and fx, separated at birth, er, construction
[11:24:28] <Krinkle> wow
[11:24:34] <gnarf> Krinkle: it rocks doesn't it?
[11:24:47] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: they used to be more different, but I've slowly been making them closer
[11:25:01] <gnarf> im not sure what "state" is
[11:25:03] <Krinkle> I have a short cut to access imgur.com in 1 sec but then I have to either browse.. or drag/drop
[11:25:13] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: i have been meaning to send you an attaboy or two
[11:25:26] <gnarf> Krinkle: gayzo is the same thing for windows too
[11:25:35] <gnarf> gyazo
[11:25:36] <gnarf> sorry
[11:25:40] <DaveMethvin> lol
[11:25:44] <Krinkle> "expose to desktop" in mac os x does make that drag/drop easy, but still. this is just a shortcut (ctrl-alt-R) and then I have the link ready in my clipboard !
[11:25:57] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Excuse me, a {what}boy ?
[11:26:03] <DaveMethvin> atta
[11:26:12] <DaveMethvin> as in, "good job" !
[11:26:12] <gnarf> That's a
[11:26:32] <Krinkle> My vocabulary expands again :)
[11:26:34] <Krinkle> Thanks DaveMethvin
[11:26:40] <Krinkle> (that's a double thanks)
[11:26:44] <DaveMethvin> An informal expression of encouragement or admiration, typically to a man or boy.
[11:26:54] <Krinkle> yes, that's what google gave me
[11:27:05] <DaveMethvin> even google thinks you're good
[11:27:12] <Krinkle> indeed ;-)
[11:27:41] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so... my thoughts here
[11:27:55] <gnarf> what if I make jQuery.fx = jQuery.Tween
[11:27:58] <gnarf> or should i bother?
[11:28:18] <DaveMethvin> sure if you just keep the names for the commonly used stuff constant
[11:28:49] <gnarf> Would you rather see .Tween in the code, cuz I know I would
[11:28:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah Tween is super
[11:29:14] <DaveMethvin> i just didn't think about aliasing it
[11:29:45] * gnarf sighs knowing that his property naming woulda been better, but we must support some jerk using these old ones too :)
[11:30:02] <DaveMethvin> another hope, dashed on the rocks of backcompat
[11:30:30] <gnarf> I can't believe I got that thing passing all the unit tests after like 3 nights of work
[11:30:38] <DaveMethvin> i am impressed
[11:30:40] <gnarf> well, all but this fx one
[11:30:55] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure there might be something messy in the .promise() implementation
[11:31:01] <gnarf> but I don't think we have any units on it
[11:31:17] <DaveMethvin> might want to see if the UI effects stuff still works too :)
[11:31:36] * Krinkle is reading the ES5 spec
[11:32:17] <Krinkle> I always believed and evangelized how JavaScript doesn't have a global object and the 'window' object in browsers is just a local object that is made apparent global
[11:32:30] <Krinkle> because <script> and .js executes in a hidden with(window) {} context
[11:32:36] <gnarf> ?tell jaubourg hey - I NEED your opinion/review/feedback on this new effects stuff --- gnarf37/jquery - 1.8-effects branch -- find me on skype/irc/in your dreams - whatever ;)
[11:32:37] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[11:33:11] <Krinkle> apparently there IS a global object in javascript, except that it is not named but browsers can create add a property to it that refers to itself
[11:33:19] <Krinkle> about:blank; Object.keys(window);
[11:33:20] <Krinkle> ["top", "location", "window", "external", "chrome", "v8Locale", "document"]'
[11:33:47] <Krinkle> those are the only window properties, the rest is one scope higher (the real global scope that has no name)
[11:34:12] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: yeah, and oldIE is even more bizarre as I recall
[11:34:59] <Krinkle> yeah, but I mean the "official" standard. oldIE is a different story alltogether
[11:35:05] <DaveMethvin> i think kangax did a great article about the diffs
[11:35:23] <DaveMethvin> http://perfectionkills.com/unnecessarily-comprehensive-look-into-a-rather-insignificant-issue-of-global-objects-creation/
[11:35:27] <Krinkle> I find embarrassing how a google for "JScript" puts jQuery on #4 though
[11:35:44] <DaveMethvin> oh, because of guilt by association? :P
[11:35:49] <Krinkle> right
[11:36:12] <Krinkle> Wikipeida ranks #1, MSDN/JScript main page is #2
[11:36:13] <gnarf> hey - it beatz w3schools
[11:36:15] <gnarf> im okay with that
[11:36:26] <Krinkle> yeah I was just wondering the same
[11:37:10] <Krinkle> did you read the article about w3schools (whether or not intentionally) pollutes google very good? even if you blacklist it via this link that google shows if you hit Back right after clicking a w3s link
[11:37:58] <Krinkle> http://www.impressivewebs.com/web-development-search-results-manipulated/
[11:40:14] <Krinkle> http://thisistheworstsiteontheinternet.w3schools.com/
[11:40:16] <Krinkle> :D
[11:40:52] <Krinkle> http://xxx-torrents-download-accelerator.w3schools.com/
[11:40:58] <Krinkle> etc. the list goes on
[11:41:21] <DaveMethvin> damn w3schools, you scary
[11:41:33] <gnarf> its just a *.
[11:41:36] <gnarf> no biggie
[11:41:46] <Krinkle> Yeah, but there is a significant amount of page rank behind them
[11:42:05] <Krinkle> it's not actual subdomains I know that, so anyone can think one up and link to it
[11:42:21] <Krinkle> but they do rank high, and that's what I find odd
[11:45:16] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i have that in my blocking and it does not appear to work
[11:45:29] <DaveMethvin> very strange, i just double checked
[11:48:40] <gnarf> we should add that to w3fools.com
[11:48:54] <gnarf> fill up the propaganda papers
[11:49:04] <gnarf> better yet
[11:49:23] <gnarf> we should make google allow blacklisting entire TLDs
[11:49:33] <gnarf> paul_irish: ?
[11:49:34] <gnarf> :)
[11:49:38] <paul_irish> SUP

[11:49:48] <paul_irish> ^^^^^
[11:49:55] <gnarf> o/ <3
[11:50:06] <paul_irish> i already pinged cutts about it.
[11:50:09] <gnarf> ?js peen(4) @paul_irish
[11:50:09] <paul_irish> lets see what else i can do
[11:50:14] <bot-t> paul_irish: "8====D"
[11:50:14] <gnarf> oh damn
[11:50:19] <paul_irish> thanks for the peen
[11:50:24] <gnarf> hawt
[11:50:56] <gnarf> paul_irish: do you like looking a code
[11:51:02] <gnarf> and / or - reviewing it?
[11:51:14] <gnarf> s/a/@/
[11:51:56] <gnarf> paul_irish: looking for feedback on my new Animate stuff -- github - gnarf37/jquery -- 1.8-effects branch
[11:52:12] <paul_irish> also
[11:52:18] <paul_irish> no i cant
[11:52:19] <paul_irish> but
[11:52:19] <gnarf> it has the word "tweener" in it a lot
[11:52:48] <chee> 1.8 blocking issue: not enough "tweener"

[11:53:45] <gnarf> innerstin
[11:55:17] <paul_irish> https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/spamreportform?hl=en i just filled that out btw
[11:55:23] <paul_irish> looking for a more internal one
[11:57:33] <gnarf> paul_irish: hey btw - did anything come of our walk to the bar conversation about a way to detect if an element is using top/right/bottom/left auto positioning?
[11:57:47] <gnarf> i was recently reminded of it
[11:57:51] <gnarf> and thought of you
[11:58:13] <gnarf> cuz i would still like a way to detect what positioning properties the element is using in jQuery UI Effects
[11:58:44] <gnarf> so i can leave it in the same state i found it
[12:07:27] <paul_irish> hm
[12:07:35] <paul_irish> i feel like you know the answer to that better than i do
[12:08:24] <mikesherov> just pushed the rewritten pulley to github: https://github.com/jeresig/pulley/
[12:08:33] <mikesherov> in case anyone wants to give it a whirl
[12:18:43] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: frog march is an awesome word
[12:18:47] <mikesherov> that is all
[12:18:58] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:19:20] <DaveMethvin> i love giving code human qualities
[12:19:30] <DaveMethvin> since it causes me inhuman pain
[12:19:38] <mikesherov> frog-march plays second fiddle only to duck-punch
[12:20:39] <DaveMethvin> it's like noah's ark in here, someone open a window
[12:21:28] <mikesherov> btw, I'm finishing up the .css('width') / .width() separation right now
[12:22:03] <mikesherov> Firefox is funny. getComputedStyle('width') is wrong with border-box
[12:22:12] <mikesherov> it's not round-trippable
[12:25:42] <DaveMethvin> BACK OUT THE PATCH
[12:25:45] <DaveMethvin> haha
[12:26:01] <DaveMethvin> Dear Firefox: That's not funny
[12:26:20] <mikesherov> no no no, my patch is fine
[12:27:03] <mikesherov> it's the next one I'm working on that needs a support test
[12:27:45] <DaveMethvin> wow, with everyone discovering border-box I'm surprised gCS("width") could be wrong in FF
[12:27:50] <DaveMethvin> is there a bug reported on it?
[12:28:14] <DaveMethvin> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=520992
[12:28:50] <DaveMethvin> October 2009 ... unconfirmed
[12:29:39] <DaveMethvin> so mikesherov what do we do for a case like that?
[12:30:45] <mikesherov> there is a bug reported on it, and I'm on top of it
[12:30:58] <mikesherov> regarding https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=520992, no idea
[12:31:52] <mikesherov> I'll fix it myself! :-P
[12:32:33] <DaveMethvin> that's the spirit!
[12:33:20] <mikesherov> I mean, honestly, someone's got to
[12:33:36] <mikesherov> I spent about a few days reporting bugs in gCS to W3C CSSOM guy
[12:33:48] <mikesherov> then I spent a few days reporting to chrome and FF what they're doing wrong
[12:33:55] <mikesherov> now, working around in jQuery
[12:34:01] <mikesherov> next stop, fix in browser myself
[12:35:08] <mikesherov> there's no reason it shouldn't work
[12:35:30] <DaveMethvin> i have a feeling that codebase is somewhat unholy
[12:36:18] <DaveMethvin> its unfortunate how much "setup"has to go into learning a project before you can really contribute
[12:36:28] <DaveMethvin> b/c i agree there are some itches in ff i'd really like to scratch
