[10:20:09] <mikesherov> .
[10:20:10] <bot-t> (18 hours 9 mins ago) <DaveMethvin> tell mikesherov I do it the real man's way, either a cherry-pick or a merge --no-commit --squash, then touch up and a commit -a --author "their name"
[10:20:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah so there, mikesherov!
[10:20:50] <mikesherov> LOL
[10:20:58] <mikesherov> isn't that what pulley does?
[10:21:03] <DaveMethvin> none of that wimp pulley stuff for me
[10:21:03] <mikesherov> you are just a real man
[10:21:19] <mikesherov> http://xkcd.com/378/
[10:21:24] <DaveMethvin> quite often if i can't cherry pick i end up wanting to make a minor tweak before the commit
[10:21:29] <DaveMethvin> like in the commit message
[10:21:35] <DaveMethvin> you know, anal retentive stuff :P
[10:21:40] <mikesherov> right
[10:21:53] <mikesherov> commit -a is the amend command
[10:21:57] <mikesherov> I learned something just now
[10:22:00] <DaveMethvin> you can do that with commit --amend yeah
[10:22:10] <mikesherov> cool, thanks
[10:22:28] <mikesherov> I'm days away from moving my team to git from SVN
[10:22:36] <DaveMethvin> to me the default of two messages is bad
[10:22:41] <mikesherov> I agree
[10:22:44] <mikesherov> it's confusing
[10:22:50] <DaveMethvin> esp because it will reflect the time the original commit was done
[10:22:54] <DaveMethvin> which coud have been a month ago
[10:23:12] <mikesherov> I also like the idea of the commit timestamp being the merge time instead of the initial commit time
[10:23:18] <mikesherov> right
[10:23:25] <mikesherov> I look down when I type
[10:23:31] <DaveMethvin> the main reason i didn't use pulley originally was b/c node was screwed up for windows
[10:23:34] <mikesherov> so I sent that not knowing you sent hat
[10:23:44] <mikesherov> SEND HAT
[10:23:47] <DaveMethvin> i just type badly
[10:23:53] <DaveMethvin> and look at the screen
[10:23:59] <mikesherov> LOL
[10:24:11] <mikesherov> I never learned touch typing
[10:24:26] <DaveMethvin> i used to be even better at typing but now i am lazy
[10:24:28] <mikesherov> so, yeah, I committed the PR for detecting PHP in the unit tests
[10:24:38] <mikesherov> hopefully, it's what you guys are after
[10:24:49] <DaveMethvin> i'll land it soon and edit your commit message to be funnier
[10:24:52] <DaveMethvin> :D
[10:24:55] <mikesherov> HAHA
[10:25:20] <mikesherov> And in doing so, I discovered that the queue: delay() tests are super flaky in firefox
[10:25:26] <mikesherov> SUPER FLAKY
[10:25:32] <paul_irish> how flaky?
[10:25:50] <mikesherov> half the time it passes, half the time it just hangs
[10:25:52] <DaveMethvin> they're so flaky that tony the tiger said THEY'RE GREAAAT
[10:25:53] <mikesherov> and ever gets run
[10:26:03] <mikesherov> never*
[10:26:09] <DaveMethvin> yes i've been meaning to deal with the test fails
[10:26:16] <mikesherov> it's not a fail
[10:26:22] <mikesherov> it's a straight up hang
[10:26:37] <DaveMethvin> which kind of makes the unit tests unusable
[10:26:51] <mikesherov> it's like stop() is called, and then start is called in a setTimeout but it never fired
[10:26:52] <DaveMethvin> i've seen the black box fail and the tests fail too
[10:27:04] <mikesherov> only happens in FF
[10:27:32] <DaveMethvin> if  you know how to fixee i would be grateful
[10:27:50] <mikesherov> I have NFC
[10:28:20] <mikesherov> paul_irish: you lurking?
[10:28:31] <mikesherov> paul_irish: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9338 makes me so sad
[10:29:03] <mikesherov> getComputedStyle makes me have hulk-smash level rage
[10:29:53] <mikesherov> will it return pixels? will it return zero? wit it return "used value"? will it return "computed value"? or "resolved value"?
[10:29:57] <mikesherov> HEAD ASPLODE
[10:30:16] <paul_irish> mikesherov: always
[10:30:32] <mikesherov> always what?
[10:30:33] <paul_irish> mikesherov: you should email jarrod
[10:30:35] <paul_irish> always lurking
[10:30:36] <mikesherov> I did
[10:30:47] <mikesherov> I don't want to be a pest about it
[10:31:07] <paul_irish> tell him jQuery will shower Sencha with praise
[10:31:15] <paul_irish> :p
[10:31:19] <mikesherov> it's me trying to force the CSSOM on people even though it's editor's draft
[10:31:31] <paul_irish> oic
[10:31:38] <paul_irish> people think cssom is broken
[10:31:43] <paul_irish> just got a new editor i hear
[10:31:46] <mikesherov> yes
[10:31:51] <paul_irish> shared between Glenn and Shane
[10:32:08] <mikesherov> So do I just bring it up to them?
[10:32:15] <paul_irish> yes
[10:32:21] <paul_irish> on www-style where i think cssom is debated
[10:32:25] <mikesherov> yeah
[10:32:31] <mikesherov> I once posted there
[10:32:41] <mikesherov> and it was like "yes, this is how CSSOM works"
[10:33:07] <mikesherov> getComputedStyle makes me sad
[10:33:20] <mikesherov> we need a new JS API for style resolution
[10:33:25] <mikesherov> that isn't so magical
[10:33:34] <mikesherov> the rules for getComputedStyle is bonkers
[10:33:39] <mikesherov> I'll raise it to them again
[10:33:41] <mikesherov> thanks
[11:59:35] <johnbender> danheberden: who was it that I was supposed to consult  before setting up a swapfile on the server that's hosting jenkins and jquerymobile.com
[12:00:49] <johnbender> I have timmywill in my brain but he seems to think I've got that wrong :D
[12:12:55] <danheberden> johnbender the only thing i remember asking was about the min/max memory settings when the jvm is started
[12:15:06] <danheberden> though i'm pretty sure the virtuozzo part doesn't allow swp file creation
[12:15:11] <danheberden> at least on ve's
[12:16:18] <danheberden> http://kb.parallels.com/1296
[12:16:42] <danheberden> it can be emulated, but that would be the same as using the ram
[12:18:13] <johnbender> danheberden: I'm trying to figure out what the max heap default is for the jvm, but it may not matter. I just watching the memory spike to about 95% of maximum when I ran my build
[12:18:40] <johnbender> to be clear it's dying on execing the git fetch
[12:18:45] <johnbender> we're not doing anything insane
[12:20:01] <johnbender> danheberden: when you say that virtuozzo "doesn't allow swap file creation" do you mean it's going to fail when I use mkswap
[12:20:32] <johnbender> +?
[12:22:18] <danheberden> johnbender i *think* - i can't remember when I personally ran into the issue, and of course have heard others having problems
[12:22:33] <danheberden> the git fetch causing problems is weird - unless it's all the file hooks going crazy?
[12:22:38] <danheberden> if so, is that an IO issue?
[12:23:09] <johnbender> danheberden: I'm not clear that it has anything to do with git, it just throws a ...
[12:23:16] <johnbender> java.io.IOException: error=12, Cannot allocate memory
[12:24:22] <johnbender> danheberden: though I will point out that it seems isolated to IO actions, though that may just be because there's a large memory allocation there
[12:24:40] <johnbender> s/isolated/correlated/
[12:27:17] <danheberden> hmmm
[12:51:23] <eddiemonge> is there an expected outcome for using .text() on a <script> tag? or is it an unsupported thing
[13:09:30] <DaveMethvin> eddiemonge: it's unsupported ... also, what should be the outcome if you have a div with a script inside it <evil grin>
[13:11:28] <eddiemonge> does .text() parse its contents?
[13:12:12] <danheberden> ?eval $( '<script>wat<div>nou<script>omg</script></div></script>').text();
[13:12:12] <bot-t> danheberden: TypeError: div is undefined
[13:12:21] <danheberden> wat
[13:13:56] <DaveMethvin> ?eval $( '<script>wat<div>nou<script>omg</script></div></scr'+'ipt>').text();
[13:13:56] <bot-t> DaveMethvin: TypeError: div is undefined
[13:14:42] <DaveMethvin> nested script tags, i am disappoint
[13:29:52] <danheberden> DaveMethvin exactly
[13:49:46] <johnbender> danheberden: so who was it that set up the server so we can ask about the swap file?
[13:50:33] <danheberden> johnbender we're going to have to move it to a machine with more memory
[13:50:41] <danheberden> swap file aren't going to be possible
[13:50:55] <danheberden> the start of server allocation will be next week
[13:50:58] <johnbender> danheberden: :(
[13:51:04] <danheberden> so hopefully we can get that moved in a timely manner
[13:51:19] <johnbender> danheberden: well keep in mind that it's 32 bit ...
[13:53:46] <johnbender> danheberden: I'm under the impression (I have been since around 98 when I ran my first linux desktop) that some sort of swap space is generally a good idea no?
[13:54:13] <johnbender> I'm still curious how virtuozzo replaces that
[13:54:25] <danheberden> johnbender it's supposed to be 'ok' because you have burstable ram through virtuozzo? but i really don't understand why
[13:54:32] <johnbender> kk
[13:57:45] <johnbender> danheberden: obviously you can't burst past the maximum amount of addressable memory, I guess that's something to keep in mind for the future
[13:58:10] <danheberden> johnbender: i wonder if the new nitro box can handle a swap file?
[13:58:25] <johnbender> danheberden: are they creating the machines now?
[13:58:33] <danheberden> though that poor box is overloaded anyway
[13:58:43] * johnbender would like to request a swap partition on the new boxes :D
[13:58:45] <danheberden> i'm sure not running every effing jq site on it AND swarm would hlep, lol
[13:58:54] <danheberden> johnbender they are built
[13:58:55] <johnbender> indeed
[13:59:06] <johnbender> danheberden: do they have swap space?
[14:00:21] <danheberden> johnbender haven't looked yet, heh
[14:00:24] <danheberden> it's still a "VE"
[14:00:28] <danheberden> well, no
[14:00:37] <danheberden> it's dedicated, so it's that image but not in virtuozzo i think
[14:00:55] <danheberden> it does have 16 cores though, so you know, whatevs
[14:03:33] <johnbender> danheberden: so we're positive I can't create a swapfile in the meantime
[14:03:39] * johnbender is grasping at straws
[14:03:49] <danheberden> if you want to try, by all means
[14:04:02] <danheberden> but parallels, jdsharp who originally allocated these servers and others have said no :(
[14:04:15] <danheberden> but maybe mt updated something? maybe?
[14:04:59] <johnbender> danheberden: is there any chance I could contact them, I'm curious as to why I can't create a swap file
[14:05:11] <johnbender> are they on the infra mailing list?
[14:07:31] <danheberden> corey and chris lea are, ya
[14:08:03] <danheberden> chris lea has been the main contact
[14:09:42] <Corey> I'm not at (mt) anymore.
[14:09:46] <Corey> I just pitch in when things explode. :-)
[14:13:26] <danheberden> Corey - oh! well much appreciated sir :D
[14:13:47] <Corey> It's easier now that I don't have to toe the company line. :-)
[14:14:31] <danheberden> So you'd probably know the quick/definitive answer, Corey, if you can make swap files on the ve's
[14:14:34] <danheberden> ya?
[14:17:18] <johnbender> Corey: that is `mkswap /swapfile; chmod 0600 /swapfile; echo '/swapfile swap swap defaults 0 0; reboot -h 0"
[14:17:52] <johnbender> have to zero out the swapfile first with dd
[14:17:56] <johnbender> but that's the question
[14:26:01] <Corey> I think so, but MT may have to flip a switch.
[14:26:06] <Corey> No need for reboot though.
[14:26:11] <Corey> "swapon" is your friend.
[14:26:23] <Corey> Testing.
[14:26:37] <johnbender> Corey: I really appreciate it
[14:26:54] * johnbender thanks Corey heartily
[14:27:05] <danheberden> yay \o/
[14:27:36] <johnbender> danheberden: sorry to pester you so much, but keeping that build running is something that todd parker pings me about alot
[14:27:40] <Corey> Or not.
[14:27:41] <Corey> http://forums.vpslink.com/linux/1567-how-create-swapfile-your-vps.html
[14:27:44] <Corey> :-)
[14:27:50] <Corey> I like their subtle warning.
[14:28:28] <danheberden> that looks all too familiar of a message/reasoning
[14:28:41] <johnbender> Corey: ah ok, it's because the cost is associated with memory usage
[14:28:43] <johnbender> arg!
[14:28:59] <johnbender> Corey: swap partition?
[14:29:04] <johnbender> lol
[14:29:28] <danheberden> johnbender i'm as interested in getting it working too - just in the middle of setting stuff up this week so that we can, like, actually start moving these servies
[14:29:31] <danheberden> *services
[14:29:47] <Corey> johnbender: Unfortunately that's not how OpenVZ / Virtuozzo work.
[14:30:04] <Corey> Explain it like I'm five; what's the real-world problem?
[14:30:21] <johnbender> Corey: the reason for wanting swap space?
[14:30:31] <johnbender> we're running out of memory on jenkins builds
[14:31:04] <johnbender> we could serialize the builds which would help a bit but it gets close to the limit with one build running
[14:32:03] <danheberden> though the same box is also running jquerymobile.com, jquerymobile dist builds, swarm and view.jqueryui.com
[14:32:15] <johnbender> ^
[14:32:20] <danheberden> hence why i think moving it to a more capable box is the answer
[14:32:31] <johnbender> danheberden: long term it most certainly is
[14:32:40] <johnbender> or just moving jenkins somewhere else
[14:32:48] <danheberden> though i'm curious of the possible issues with git and jvm colliding on file handles
[14:32:51] * johnbender secretly wishes we were using buildbot
[14:33:09] <danheberden> johnbender what is the jenkins proces doin?
[14:33:29] <danheberden> is it building jquerymobile docs/src?
[14:34:11] <johnbender> danheberden: yah
[14:34:25] <johnbender> just a couple shell execs
[14:34:38] <danheberden> that process should have been on services.jquery.com from the get go
[14:37:45] <Corey> I'm running Jenkins on my own OpenVZ box.
[14:37:49] <Corey> It's a neat tool.
[15:41:23] <nsfmc> while trying to track down a bug, i noticed that calling .clone() on a script causes the contents to be cleared out in ie8, but not in other browsers. http://jsfiddle.net/QCp2P/3/ in the #jquery room, i got the impression i was doing something stupid, but it seems weird for clone to clean out an element
[15:42:53] <nsfmc> so umm... yeah, if anyone has any feedback on what's going on, i'd be happy to hear it
[15:45:55] <nsfmc> or in particular if this is the problem i'm running up against https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L592
[15:48:25] <DaveMethvin> nsfmc: what are you trying to accomplish by cloning a script? this isn't a commonly reported problem so it may be better to do it a way that just works
[15:49:07] <nsfmc> i'm actually not cloning it for fun, i'm hooking into another project which clones it (and other friends) as a result of its execution
[15:50:11] <DaveMethvin> i still don't know what the effect of this is, or why you'd want to do it
[15:50:50] <DaveMethvin> so is the foo/bar type a template or something?
[15:51:12] <DaveMethvin> or is it real executable code?
[15:51:25] <DaveMethvin> that the browser should run, for example
[15:51:54] <nsfmc> so i agree that it's bad that it's being cloned
[15:52:19] <eddiemonge> DaveMethvin: this is kind of what i was asking earlier, in fact for the person that was asking
[15:52:22] <nsfmc> argh, brb
[15:53:32] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8111
[15:53:54] <DaveMethvin> eddiemonge: was that the q about text?
[15:53:57] <nsfmc> yes, so i'm cool with that behavior
[15:54:01] <nsfmc> the .text behavior
[15:54:48] <eddiemonge> i see them as the same concept/behavior
[15:55:10] <DaveMethvin> you mean you're cool with the current behavior as of 1.7.1? or the behavior we'll have by changing the code to fix #8111?
[15:55:14] <nsfmc> so my rationale is that i'm hooking into the exercise framework for the khan academy, but as a result of its dynamic exercise loading for review mode, it extracts each exercise and clones it
[15:55:50] <nsfmc> (i can agree that .text() behaving like spec suggests is ok)
[15:55:54] <DaveMethvin> k
[15:56:37] <nsfmc> what confuses me is that .clone would clean out the <script> which, i'm sure i can work around
[15:56:53] <nsfmc> so if it's 'notabug' i can deal
[15:57:10] <nsfmc> but the emptying behavior feels like a bug to me
[15:58:03] <DaveMethvin> hmm, where does it actually break? are you saying the clone breaks, or the .html()
[15:58:07] <eddiemonge> i agree with this statement from jitter: "Who uses inline script tags anyway ;)"
[15:58:12] <nsfmc> the clone breaks
[15:58:12] <DaveMethvin> lemme fire up my ie
[15:58:32] <nsfmc> (apologies for the ie loading)
[15:58:36] <DaveMethvin> well i tend to agree, inline scripts are such a mess
[15:58:41] <DaveMethvin> oh waitaminit
[15:59:01] <nsfmc> waiting :)
[15:59:15] <DaveMethvin> no, we strip out executable scripts, but shouldn't strip others
[16:00:15] <nsfmc> so $("[type='foo/bar']") should be ok, or will it get flagged as executable?
[16:02:05] <DaveMethvin> http://jsfiddle.net/QCp2P/4/
[16:02:16] <DaveMethvin> just tryna figure out where jQuery is coming in
[16:02:29] <DaveMethvin> seems like this is mangled before we get to it?
[16:03:18] <DaveMethvin> we strip out executable javascript and run it, once, so that it will not be run again by subsequent manipulation
[16:03:29] <DaveMethvin> there is a ticket about that, it messes up in some cases
[16:03:36] <DaveMethvin> but it's not related to this
[16:03:43] <nsfmc> hmmm
[16:04:52] <DaveMethvin> so it looks like ie7 cloneNode strips out the contents of the script?
[16:04:53] <nsfmc> what browser does that example work in?
[16:05:08] <DaveMethvin> oh, i tried it in ie7
[16:05:41] <DaveMethvin> and whaddya know it's broken everywhere :)
[16:05:47] <DaveMethvin> but does it seem like it should be?
[16:06:01] <eddiemonge> doesnt ie treat all script types as JS?
[16:06:03] <DaveMethvin> duh, (true)
[16:06:15] <nsfmc> so $.clone seems ok, but Node.cloneNode seems problematic
[16:06:17] <DaveMethvin> http://jsfiddle.net/QCp2P/5/
[16:06:34] <nsfmc> no eddiemonge, ie ignores the script tag unless it's text/js or undefined type
[16:06:53] <DaveMethvin> ok, when you clone children it works everywhere but ie7
[16:07:09] <nsfmc> yeah, ie8 actually, i don't worry about ie7 :)
[16:07:19] <DaveMethvin> oh aren't we special :)
[16:07:40] <DaveMethvin> so something about cloneNode on script tags i guess ... ?
[16:08:04] <DaveMethvin> seems like it's worth filing a ticket but i wouldn't expect a quick resolution
[16:08:16] <nsfmc> yeah, i'm not expecting instant gratification
[16:08:36] <nsfmc> but it felt buglike (even though the behavior is admittedly dubious)
[16:08:42] <DaveMethvin> what kind of bug reporter are you? I'm ashamed
[16:08:56] <nsfmc> hahahaha
[16:08:57] <DaveMethvin> you should demand instant hotfixes or something
[16:09:27] <DaveMethvin> alright, well just stop testing on ie please because it's no fun to test or fix
[16:09:58] <nsfmc> yeah, i'll submit the bug, and i'll see what i can do to alleviate the problem at hand
[16:11:18] <DaveMethvin> on the .text() behavior that's kind of interesting, some people want a do-what-i-mean behavior where it ignores script text unless you ask for the text of a script tag directly ... was that the impression  you got eddiemonge?
[16:13:36] <eddiemonge> i would think any method would ignore anything in the <script> tag unless you are specifically targeting that and using .html()
[16:16:21] <DaveMethvin> eddiemonge: yeah, although it always feels strange to special case code like that ... i kinda wonder the same thing as jitter did
[16:16:51] <eddiemonge> there shouldnt be inline js on a page anyway
[16:17:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and people should brush their teeth after every meal!
[16:17:30] <DaveMethvin> i've given up on people writing sane code
[16:17:47] <DaveMethvin> it's just a question of how much padding we apply to the api to prevent serious injury
[16:18:27] <eddiemonge> doesnt matter. people dont read the docs anyway to know how to use things
[16:18:41] <DaveMethvin> well if it doesn't work like they expect, it's a bug!
[16:20:09] <DaveMethvin> and if I accidentally misuse an api there should be a tidy alert box that says, "excuse me but you're calling .attr("vlaue", "5") and I am pretty sure you meant .attr("value", "5")
[16:20:33] <eddiemonge> inorite!
[16:20:34] <DaveMethvin> maybe with an animated paper clip
[16:21:08] <eddiemonge> whatever happened with the git docs branch?
[16:21:20] <DaveMethvin> I hope it will get going soon
[16:21:35] <DaveMethvin> we shoudl have a few people starting on projects in the next couple of weeks
[16:22:22] <eddiemonge> been hearing that for a year now
[16:22:36] <eddiemonge> kind of why i resigned from most teams i was unofficially on
[16:22:37] <DaveMethvin> we realllly mean it this time!
[16:22:57] <DaveMethvin> i know, it's hard to get people moving sometimes
[16:23:18] <eddiemonge> i had bandwidth for awhile but no direction. thats frustrating too
[16:23:58] <DaveMethvin> there's definitely some challenges to scaling a volunteer organization
[16:24:35] <mikesherov> .
[16:24:45] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[16:24:52] <mikesherov> hello hello
[16:24:52] <DaveMethvin> on the train?
[16:24:55] <mikesherov> yes sir
[16:25:03] <DaveMethvin> choo choo!
[16:25:17] <mikesherov> are we talking about the pitfalls of drive vs. direction?
[16:25:29] <DaveMethvin> i just drive in any direction
[16:25:42] <mikesherov> You know what kills my drive
[16:25:45] <DaveMethvin> eddiemonge wants to drive in a specific direction, that's his problem right ther
[16:25:49] <mikesherov> all this hoopla over vendor-prefixs
[16:25:49] <DaveMethvin> wazzat
[16:26:01] <mikesherov> it's bonkers
[16:26:24] <DaveMethvin> well it IS annoying, i really get the feeling there is no desire to standardize anymore after they release stuff
[16:26:50] <DaveMethvin> and you can see from their meeting notes that nobody wants to discuss stuff before they reveal an implementation
[16:26:54] <mikesherov> Look, release a feature, then figure out how to standardize when people start using it
[16:26:59] <DaveMethvin> it's the same with the -ms-box stuff too
[16:27:18] <DaveMethvin> in that case i'd prefer to avoid prefixes
[16:27:20] <mikesherov> I'm not sure why they behave that way?
[16:27:22] <DaveMethvin> let em slug it out
[16:27:36] <mikesherov> the web is a platform
[16:28:02] <mikesherov> whether browser A or B has flexbox or not isn't what's driving browser usage
[16:28:09] <mikesherov> it's everything else
[16:28:20] <DaveMethvin> well really it's browser market share
[16:28:21] <mikesherov> the enemy isn
[16:28:29] <DaveMethvin> and that's why firefox/opera/ms are complaining
[16:28:39] <mikesherov> the enemy isn't other browsers though, it's the app paradigm
[16:29:08] <DaveMethvin> i think the app paradigm is a result of being lazy about web design
[16:29:13] <mikesherov> I'm not sure I really follow
[16:29:18] <mikesherov> maybe I'm just naive
[16:29:19] <DaveMethvin> too many web sites are built out of 5-year-old tech
[16:29:28] <DaveMethvin> and tryna make them work with mobile is too hard
[16:29:32] <DaveMethvin> so apps are the "solution"
[16:29:45] <DaveMethvin> rather than making responsive designs for example
[16:29:55] <DaveMethvin> like, go to major sites with your phone
[16:30:00] <DaveMethvin> and they're funneling you to their app
[16:30:09] <DaveMethvin> because they KNOW their web site is unusuable on a phone
[16:30:25] <mikesherov> I disagree
[16:30:33] <DaveMethvin> oh good
[16:30:43] <DaveMethvin> another perspective! :)
[16:30:45] <mikesherov> I think it's because most product manager like being a shortcut from the app's phone page
[16:30:56] <mikesherov> home screen
[16:31:03] <mikesherov> Man, my typing is god awful today
[16:31:18] <DaveMethvin> their branding is better that way, i agree
[16:31:31] <mikesherov> they like saying "hey, we have X 'installs' and 'downloads'"
[16:31:40] <mikesherov> for some reason, that sounds more impressive than visits
[16:31:54] <DaveMethvin> and of course there is no browser implementation of webkitStealAddressBook(stealthy) so there's that
[16:31:55] <mikesherov> I think that's the whole freaking shebang
[16:32:29] <mikesherov> if you ask me, and no one did, this is much ado about nothing
[16:32:40] <DaveMethvin> really i think most apps will go to html/js so it's not a tech issue
[16:32:43] <mikesherov> just make the web more awesome, stop bickering about fairness
[16:33:09] <DaveMethvin> since you can't use ff/opera on an iPhone their market share isn't affected
[16:33:22] <DaveMethvin> so i think there could be legit reasons to only use -webkit
[16:33:27] <mikesherov> OH
[16:33:27] <mikesherov> I see
[16:34:37] <DaveMethvin> but i tellya it's going to get worse before it gets better
[16:34:58] <mikesherov> you're saying the dominance on mobile, with vendor prefixes, causes non-mobile sites to only implement -webkit
[16:34:59] <eddiemonge> if it ever gets better
[16:35:13] <eddiemonge> the standards groups are all out of whack
[16:35:15] <mikesherov> what does "get worse" mean?
[16:35:25] <DaveMethvin> we'll have html, js, and css in common but the environments are going to be very proprietary
[16:35:29] <mikesherov> "out of whack"? what does that mean?
[16:35:42] <DaveMethvin> just as an example
[16:35:52] <DaveMethvin> webkit has a touch events model that apple wrote
[16:35:55] <DaveMethvin> they have patents
[16:36:08] <DaveMethvin> that touch model was going to be standardized by w3c
[16:36:18] <DaveMethvin> but now they cannot do it, apple won't license the patents
[16:36:20] <DaveMethvin> sooo
[16:36:29] <DaveMethvin> microsoft is going to do its own touch model
[16:36:38] <DaveMethvin> firefox currently has the old w3c model
[16:36:43] <DaveMethvin> kinda-sorta like webkit
[16:36:47] <paul_irish> hey speaking of
[16:36:57] <mikesherov> So, more fodder for jQuery I guess
[16:37:00] <DaveMethvin> chaos?
[16:37:00] <paul_irish> you can Emulate Touch Events in canary's devtools now
[16:37:14] <paul_irish> http://paulirish.com/demo/multi is touch only
[16:37:14] <DaveMethvin> oh like on the desktop paul_irish
[16:37:17] <paul_irish> yup
[16:37:22] <DaveMethvin> that will be very useful
[16:37:35] <paul_irish> canary / devtools / settings (bottom right ) / enable touch emu
[16:37:37] <mikesherov> I suppose it'll keep us "in business" for quite a while
[16:37:50] <paul_irish> and as long as devtools is open you can click and it does all the touch events
[16:37:51] <paul_irish> its awesome
[16:38:04] <DaveMethvin> there is so much ipad-centricity it's gonna be scary to watch stuff fail in the next year
[16:38:12] <mikesherov> except those touch events are carany proprietary?
[16:38:19] <paul_irish> wha
[16:38:19] <paul_irish> no
[16:38:23] <paul_irish> its the webkit touch model
[16:38:29] <mikesherov> that's what I meant
[16:38:33] <DaveMethvin> the one apple won't license
[16:38:43] <DaveMethvin> the one the w3c is gonna bail on most likely
[16:38:45] <paul_irish> HEY IM JUST REPORTING FACTS GUYS
[16:38:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[16:38:51] <mikesherov> You know, I don't mind
[16:38:57] <DaveMethvin> but it's a defacto standard
[16:39:02] <DaveMethvin> a very dominant one
[16:39:09] <paul_irish> i told msft guys that they're assholes
[16:39:15] <mikesherov> paul_irish: I'm just pulling your chain
[16:39:15] <paul_irish> for introducing a new touch model
[16:39:17] <mikesherov> HAHA
[16:39:30] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: i thought so too until i saw that apple wouldn't licnese the patents
[16:39:53] <DaveMethvin> no way any big company is gonna build a product around something with patents they don't have clearance on
[16:39:58] <mikesherov> right, but they can't implement the apple one, so what's the alternative? Doing nothing?
[16:40:10] <DaveMethvin> right they had to build a new one
[16:40:16] <DaveMethvin> that was their alternative
[16:40:21] <DaveMethvin> but it sucks so bad
[16:40:26] <mikesherov> this is less about vendor prefixes though, and way more about patents
[16:40:31] <mikesherov> which is a much older problem
[16:40:42] <DaveMethvin> well it's about the coming divergence of platforms
[16:40:51] <DaveMethvin> just when we thought we were entering nirvana
[16:41:10] <DaveMethvin> god even bot-t couldn't handle it
[16:41:22] <mikesherov> why do you think this is happening all of a sudden?
[16:41:53] <DaveMethvin> so like, we'll all be writing html and javascript but with -webkit-stuff and MSPointerStuff
[16:42:10] <DaveMethvin> differentiation
[16:42:14] <mikesherov> but why is the divergence happening now?
[16:42:29] <mikesherov> seems like we were going in the right direction for a bit
[16:42:48] <DaveMethvin> some of it was needed, we needed SOME touch model and you know apple, no way they'd discuss that before they released
[16:42:56] <mikesherov> think it's due to the auto-update release model?
[16:43:15] <DaveMethvin> if anything, the faster pace should make it easier to forge standards
[16:43:18] <DaveMethvin> but it's not
[16:43:32] <DaveMethvin> look at the minutes from that css meeting
[16:43:38] <mikesherov> Sounds like a natural ebb and flow
[16:43:51] <DaveMethvin> apple is saying they won't talk about anything before they ship, and microsoft's rep agrees
[16:43:57] <mikesherov> new things are possible: proprietary stuff
[16:44:06] <mikesherov> people get fed up, innovation is stifled
[16:44:13] <mikesherov> standardization happends
[16:44:20] <mikesherov> then new things are possible...
[16:44:25] <mikesherov> wash, rinse, repeat?
[16:44:56] <DaveMethvin> well i think the reason innovation happened so quickly is that new platforms came out and we had to have new stuff like a touch model
[16:45:06] <mikesherov> right
[16:45:10] <mikesherov> and so first mover there is huge
[16:45:16] <DaveMethvin> and there was no time to just bang it out for two years in a committee anyway
[16:45:19] <mikesherov> ie6 all over again?
[16:45:29] <mikesherov> I mean, forget the committe
[16:45:41] <mikesherov> I'm fine with non-standards at the start
[16:45:49] <mikesherov> but BLOCKING standardization with patents: evil
[16:45:57] <DaveMethvin> well what IS true is that it's gonna be a golden age for libraries and frameworks if  you want to run cross platform
[16:46:10] <mikesherov> HOORAY
[16:46:17] <mikesherov> at least my coding muscles will stay in shape
[16:46:17] <DaveMethvin> nobody is gonna want to do all that mapping themselves
[16:46:30] <DaveMethvin> and if we're lucky the phones wl]ill have jquery in firmware
[16:46:45] <DaveMethvin> CHROME-ROM
[16:47:19] <DaveMethvin> the new stuff, even the new problems, are exciting
[16:47:21] <mikesherov> LOL
[16:47:27] <mikesherov> Sure
[16:47:31] <mikesherov> we're problem solvers
[16:47:39] <DaveMethvin> but of course people come back and say "why can't i clone a script tag in ie7?"
[16:47:42] <DaveMethvin> I DON"T CARE
[16:47:43] <mikesherov> just sucks that it's the devs that get shit on in all this
[16:48:07] <DaveMethvin> right, b/c the users just expect this crap to work
[16:48:10] <DaveMethvin> and it never does
[16:48:46] <mikesherov> I'm amazed anything ever works
[16:48:47] <mikesherov> ever
[16:48:58] <mikesherov> like even yum repo management
[16:49:05] <mikesherov> I was talking to my sysadmin today
[16:49:10] <mikesherov> I'm amazed yum works at all
[16:49:23] <DaveMethvin> it's kinda scary how sometimes you find a bug and you realize "holy crap that only worked by sheer luck"
[16:49:31] <mikesherov> yeah
[16:50:20] <DaveMethvin> oh damn i gotta run ... imma check out the pull q later and see if i can land some stuff
[16:50:22] <mikesherov> paul_irish: that demo is cool
[16:50:24] <DaveMethvin> cya
[16:50:27] <mikesherov> later
