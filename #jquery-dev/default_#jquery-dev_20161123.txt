[15:37:04] <gibson042> what of it?
[15:37:11] <Krinkle> gibson042: last comment
[15:38:21] <gibson042> ah
[15:38:23] <gibson042> thanks!
[15:40:05] <gibson042> the idiomatic approach would actually be `return this` â†’ `throw this`, but I disagree with that approach and far prefer your explicit "return rejected thenable" code
[15:45:08] <Krinkle> gibson042: I previously disliked this approach because potentnially multiple arguments
[15:45:15] <Krinkle> which makes it akward to re-create the same deferred
[15:45:30] <Krinkle> but as long as there is only one, creating it as Deferred(arg).reject() is simple enoguh
[15:46:14] <gibson042> +1
[15:46:17] <Krinkle> gibson042: throw this or throw 'arg1' ?
[15:46:21] <Krinkle> this = undefined
[15:46:25] <Krinkle> (in jq 3)
[15:46:30] <gibson042> right
[15:46:32] <gibson042> my mistake
[15:46:58] <gibson042> throw the argument
[15:47:41] <Krinkle> gibson042: What about void fail handlers? Are those changed as well? Or do they keep the state as rejected, but consider the value changed from it to undefined?
[15:47:57] <Krinkle> then(null, x -> return x) becomes rejected->resolved
[15:48:07] <Krinkle> what if there is no return. Does it happen then too?
[15:48:22] <Krinkle> presumably not
[15:49:34] <gibson042> do you mean like dfd.then(throws).then(onFulfilledOnly).then(onFulfilled, onRejected)?
[15:51:23] <gibson042> if there's no handler, the value passes through and the deferred state matches its predecessor
