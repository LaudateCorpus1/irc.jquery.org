[06:43:02] <miketaylr> DaveMethvin: ping
[06:43:14] <miketaylr> do you happen to know what time the meeting with moz is on the 16th?
[06:43:18] <miketaylr> (or anyone who does know)
[06:43:30] <miketaylr> hm, guess i could ping someone from moz side
[06:43:31] <miketaylr> >_>
[06:43:42] <DaveMethvin> not sure myself ... kborchers prob knows
[06:44:02] <DaveMethvin> let me check the emails, dunno if we set a time
[06:44:54] <DaveMethvin> looks like Rory and Kris were hoping for space at Civic Hall but i don't see anything finalized miketaylr 
[06:44:55] <kborchers> miketaylr: it was left with looking for space
[06:45:11] <kborchers> we are still trying to nail down the space but i think we are close
[06:45:26] <kborchers> on our end at least
[06:45:33] <kborchers> not sure if rory found anything out
[06:45:57] <miketaylr> yeah, i haven't heard from him either
[06:46:02] <miketaylr> i just pinged him on irc
[06:46:04] <miketaylr> thx kborchers DaveMethvin
[06:46:23] <miketaylr> was wondering if i could pull off arriving day of (if i come)
[06:46:43] <miketaylr> i'd rather not make a 3 day trip out of it, been in france for like 7 days already
[06:47:56] <kborchers> miketaylr: probably doable ... if we get it worked out i would want our teams to be able to get started together in the AM then maybe we could meet mid-dayish and give our folks time to get back together with their project teams for the afternoon
[06:48:16] <miketaylr> sweet
[06:48:31] <miketaylr> or i guess i could just arrive the day before and see if there's a late flight,e tc
[06:48:43] <miketaylr> NYC isn't the worst place to spend time
[06:48:46] <kborchers> :)
[06:48:52] <DaveMethvin> compared to Paris?
[06:49:04] <miketaylr> i wasn't sure if having someone from webcompat was worthwhile, but the fennec team just suggested i represent them
[06:49:15] <miketaylr> DaveMethvin: yeah, i guess Paris is more fancy
[06:49:25] <miketaylr> but they at least cook their meat in new york
[06:49:25] <DaveMethvin> it'd be great to see you anyway
[06:49:30] <DaveMethvin> haha
[06:49:31] <kborchers> +1
[06:49:39] <DaveMethvin> you won't have to eat any snails
[06:49:51] <miketaylr> i had snails and tartare for dinner the other night
[06:49:57] <miketaylr> so i'm probably chock full of parasites now
[06:50:05] <miketaylr> RIP
[06:50:10] <DaveMethvin> part of a sensible weight loss program
[06:50:26] <miketaylr> the "lose your appetite forever" plan
[06:50:38] * miketaylr sticks to the pastries
[06:51:19] <kborchers> miketaylr: just do a brisket cleans and you'll be fine
[06:51:34] <miketaylr> lol
[06:51:52] <miketaylr> ah yes, the dr pepper and smoked beef cleanse
[06:51:56] <kborchers> :)
[06:52:05] * miketaylr cries a single tear of freedom
[06:52:23] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i forget you two live in the same country ... Texas
[06:53:14] <kborchers> and i think by law if we are both in new york at the same time that is considered an occupation and Texas then owns New York
[08:37:07] <markelog> Krinkle: did you wrote me yesterday?
