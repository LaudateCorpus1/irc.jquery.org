[12:15:54] <dcherman> DaveMethvin: random thought - since the capturing phase occurs prior to the bubbling phase and goes downward, could delegated events use a capturing handler on the element handling the delegated event in order to simulate what you do now?
[12:16:13] <dcherman> would get weird with other capturing handlers, but i feel like those may be uncommon except for at the document level
