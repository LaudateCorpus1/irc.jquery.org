[09:58:53] <DaveMethvin> ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)  
[10:00:05] <ajpiano> that's a prety good face
[12:36:25] <pbramos> Lots of failures in the test recently
[13:28:53] <_|Nix|_> Hi! N00b question: What's the correct way to stop an event's handling dead in its tracks? i.e., I shall be the last handler this event ever sees. No bubbling, no other handlers, nothing. It all ends here.
[13:29:23] <_|Nix|_> I did e.preventDefault(); e.stopImmediatePropagation(); return false; from my handler.
[13:29:36] <_|Nix|_> ... and on Android 2.3.5 it still seems to keep going :(
[13:35:03] <pbramos> _|Nix|_: I think your question is better suited for #jquery.  This channel is about developing jQuery, not developing using it. :)
[13:35:37] <ajpiano> not if it's an android bug and _|Nix|_ is a jquery mobile team member :p
[13:35:47] <pbramos> woops!
[13:36:00] <pbramos> my mistake
[13:36:05] <ajpiano> sokay :)
[13:37:17] <_|Nix|_> Sorry guys, I'm just getting frustrated.
[13:37:20] <ajpiano> we had some weird issue with 2.3.4
[13:37:27] <ajpiano> so this brought that to mind
[13:37:44] <ajpiano> _|Nix|_: is it only failing in android 2.3.5 ?
[13:38:07] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Actually, if the emulator is any indication, it's also failing in 4.1 ...
[13:38:37] <ajpiano> hrm
[13:38:58] <ajpiano> assuming it works fine in say, a desktop browser, my gut would be that it's a browser bug
[13:39:08] <ajpiano> but i don't know obviously
[13:40:16] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Oh, it's almost certainly a browser bug. I just wanted to double-check that I'm not making a rookie mistake.
[13:40:44] <ajpiano> i would highly doubt that :p
[13:41:28] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Don't be so sure - I've only been doing this HTML5/CSS/js thing since September of last year.
[13:41:53] <ajpiano> well, does it work in a desktop browser :p
[13:42:17] <_|Nix|_> ajpiano: Always has. Only Android is f0rked up - as usual ...
[13:42:23] <ajpiano> bummer
[13:44:20] <_|Nix|_> Indeed ... well, I guess the Android experience is just going to have to suck ..
[18:03:06] <DaveMethvin> spammers are assholes
[19:15:20] <snover> DaveMethvin: everyone‚Äôs got one!
[19:16:08] <DaveMethvin> snover:  but i don't want to see it! ·Éö( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)·Éö 
[19:16:27] <snover> üê¥
[19:16:28] <DaveMethvin> these guys are posting all sorts of junk to trac
[19:16:54] <snover> hand-posting i presume?
[19:17:00] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[19:17:10] <DaveMethvin> it seems like the ones today were hand crafted
[19:17:11] <snover> don‚Äôt know don‚Äôt care?
[19:17:18] <DaveMethvin> just want them to stop
[19:17:26] <snover> well check the spam interface
[19:17:29] <snover> in admin
[19:17:38] <DaveMethvin> oh we can tighten it up
[19:17:47] <DaveMethvin> and then people bitch that it's rejecting their tix
[19:18:25] <snover> trac is half-working right now it seems
[19:18:32] <snover> ‚Äúplease wait while i do nothing when you try to log in‚Äù
[19:18:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah i dunno what's up with it
[19:18:50] <DaveMethvin> it was doing well 
[19:18:57] <snover> probably the joyous garbage collection of death
[19:19:37] <snover> oh well here‚Äôs a problem davemethvin
[19:19:40] <snover> cc gnarf
[19:19:49] <snover> all the ip addresses going to trac are 127.0.0.1
[19:19:52] <snover> you need to like
[19:19:54] <snover> forward those
[19:20:05] <snover> otherwise the spam killer can‚Äôt go EXCUSE ME I KNOW WHO YOU ARE
[19:21:26] <snover> without ip blacklists, the battle is lost
[19:21:59] <snover> thankfully it still stops ‚Äúbuy viagra cheap‚Äù, ‚Äúcheap evening dresses‚Äù, and ‚Äúparty poker‚Äù
[19:22:42] <DaveMethvin> i wish i knew more about how profitable that stuff it
[19:22:43] <DaveMethvin> is
[19:23:02] <DaveMethvin> i am hoping they will get tired of this after a while
[19:23:10] <snover> profitable enough to pay mechanical turk rates
[19:23:27] <DaveMethvin> turk? more like turd amirite?
[19:24:16] <snover> ok i am done touching trac, it seems interested in imploding this evening
[19:24:27] <snover> and so i let someone else be responsible for fixing it
[19:24:42] <snover> a.k.a abdicate 
[19:25:31] <DaveMethvin> it's not dead, just resting, it kinda works at least
[19:25:41] <snover> i marked some of them as spam for you dave
[19:25:56] <DaveMethvin> all my tickets no doubt!
[19:26:02] <snover> spammer dave
[19:26:25] <DaveMethvin> i saw where github is seeing spammers now too,
[19:26:28] <DaveMethvin> sad
[19:26:34] <snover> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10142#comment:11
[19:26:45] <snover> ugh DaveMethvin i have been getting spam to my github email address since forever ago
[19:27:05] <snover> wish i knew who thought letting that information be public was a good idea
[19:39:10] <gnarf> snover: X-Forwaded-For or whatever isn't being set?  i thought nginx set those whenever it proxied
[19:48:19] <snover> gnarf: maybe the spam filter is dumb
[19:48:26] <snover> and does not look at that
[19:48:26] <snover> or
[19:48:29] <snover> who knows
[19:50:24] <snover> maybe nginx does not set it by default and you need to proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $remote_addr; x)
