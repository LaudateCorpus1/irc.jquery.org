[21:02:57] <Mshven87> hey guys I come to you for desperate advice. I need to have a scrollable page on my hybrid mobile app, that contains concert schedules and events. It need to update daily. Currently there is a website that does just that, so I could pull an RSS from there. But what would be another option? Any advice would be helpful! Thanks in advanced!
