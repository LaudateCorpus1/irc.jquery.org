[18:15:10] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle leobalter scottgonzalez: someone suggested we make a repo dedicated to discussing a shared reporter interface. Can some create such a repo under the jQuery org and grant permissions the same as the "qunit" repo?
[18:18:52] <JamesMGreene> Not sure on name... "js-reporter", "universal-reporter", "common-reporter", etc.
[18:19:08] <JamesMGreene> Doesn't necessarily matter yet
[18:19:33] <JamesMGreene> We just need a centralized place to discuss and prototype
[18:30:50] <JamesMGreene> Or should I just create a not-officially-sanctioned one under my own account for now?
[19:08:55] <JamesMGr_> jzaefferer Krinkle|detached leobalter scott_gonzalez: No one around?
[20:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: I'd want much more detail before creating an account under jQuery.
[20:13:19] <scott_gonzalez> s/account/repo/
[20:14:33] <JamesMGreene> What's the brief version of the list of details?  If it's impractical or just a risky idea, I'm happy to create one under my account for now
