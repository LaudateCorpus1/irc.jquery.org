[11:59:28] <daleharvey_> Hey, how is jquery tested? as in do you guys have CI setup etc? 
[12:00:04] <daleharvey_> most of what I can find keeps bringing up stuff like testswarm, which I am guessing is very old
[12:08:18] <snover> old and still used for everything.
[12:09:45] <daleharvey_> yeh I just found the updated wiki + site
[12:16:50] <snover> iâ€™m actually working on something that, in a very long shot, might replacei t
[12:16:58] <snover> probably not though
[12:17:01] <snover> but maybe!
[12:17:56] <daleharvey_> I have a javascript library that really needs to be tested cross browser, currently using saucelabs but its not really working out
[12:19:31] <daleharvey_> the main problem is that the library needs to test itself against a running server with a lot of traffic running between it and the browser, testing in 3 browsers is running up to 30 minutes right now and most of the time ends up dying with connection issues
[12:19:47] <snover> whaaaaa
[12:20:02] <snover> 30 minutes
[12:20:13] <snover> what is up with your tests? heh
[12:20:38] <daleharvey_> it takes less than a minute per browser running locally
[12:20:49] <daleharvey_> https://travis-ci.org/daleharvey/pouchdb/builds/3873001 you can watch the latest run :P
[12:22:28] <snover> i see
[12:22:41] <snover> thatâ€™s a lot of requests
[12:23:06] <daleharvey_> yup, all running through a tunnel proxy
[12:23:27] <snover> is there a reason why you need to make so many requests?
[12:23:44] <snover> 2012-12-29 20:17:03,657 - DELETE http://localhost:2020/testdb_fdaab9f2-ca58-4aea-7638-2d7ced402e0b_1/undefined?rev=undefined -> 404 (2ms) this doesnâ€™t look so good :)
[12:24:07] <snover> anyway. what iâ€™m doing is similar to what you have already. https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-teststack
[12:26:23] <snover> If you are validating a remote API I am not sure why you are doing it from a browser like that, you should be able to separate your service API testing from client code testing using mocks
[12:27:31] <snover> With this number of requests I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if the amount of log output you are generating is slowing things down too
[12:27:37] <snover> significantly
[12:28:23] <daleharvey_> its specifically testing the integration with the remote service, not really possible to mock
[12:30:45] <snover> why do you need to send so much data to do that?
[12:34:47] <daleharvey_> we just have lots of stuff to test
