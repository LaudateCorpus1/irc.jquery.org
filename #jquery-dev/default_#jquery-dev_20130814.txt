[10:51:20] <mikesherov> paul_irish: last year at the dev summit we were tossing around the idea of a build option that exposed private internals
[10:52:09] <paul_irish> hmm. :/
[10:52:29] <paul_irish> sounds less awesome
[10:52:30] <mikesherov> imagine a src file called expose.js for example that is excluded from the normal build and excluded from the CDN that just contained public API surface that thinly passed through to private internals
[10:52:39] <mikesherov> yeah, definitely a bit less awesome
[10:53:20] <paul_irish> "sorry you cant debug your event listeners. make a custom debug build that you'll replace in a build step."
[10:53:27] <mikesherov> Word
[10:53:29] <mikesherov> not dieal
[10:53:31] <mikesherov> ideal
[10:53:47] <paul_irish> if everyone was making modular builds of jquery i think it'd have more legs
[10:54:17] <paul_irish> mikesherov: so how much do you want to kill _data('events')  ?
[10:54:23] <paul_irish> a little, a lot?
[10:54:47] <mikesherov> I don't want to kill anything, per se
[10:54:48] <mikesherov> I want to minimize the number of accidental APIs
[10:55:29] <mikesherov> I'm not sure why we don't just document a a better API to expose the event handlers
[10:55:38] <mikesherov> I remember DaveMethvin|away having a reason
[10:56:06] <mikesherov> paul_irish: why, how much do you want to kill it?
[10:56:40] <paul_irish> i dont want to. i want it there.
[10:57:13] <paul_irish> we were thinking about another solution for jQuery to provide a map file that associates a user event handler to the point of attachement
[10:57:21] <paul_irish> they're pretty ugly
[14:37:26] <paul_irish> m_gol: fwiw http://youtu.be/s-JOC_9sDCA .. the basics. still some ways to go
[14:37:33] <paul_irish> this is in canary already.
[15:48:34] <m_gol> paul_irish: cool :) I must say, though, that I prefer to be able to exclude specific files and not just patterns
[15:48:45] <paul_irish> ya
[15:48:54] <paul_irish> i think that's better too
[15:49:58] <m_gol> paul_irish: cool! :) though I'd like to be able to exclude specific files, not just patterns, as in Firefox. also, it'd be nice to be able to get rid of libraries entries from stack traces completely
[15:50:29] <paul_irish> noooooooo
[15:50:30] <paul_irish> no you dont
[15:50:53] <m_gol> no? ;)

[15:51:29] <paul_irish> you dont want them completely invisible.
[15:51:38] <paul_irish> that's a false view of your application's execution
[15:51:54] <paul_irish> you just want them out of the way
[15:52:02] <m_gol> paul_irish: you're probably right, but collapsing seems cool
[15:52:46] <m_gol> but not just in simple files - you might have a couple of vendor scripts heavily interacting with each other, they should collapse together
[15:52:53] <m_gol> * simple -> single
[15:54:00] <paul_irish> yah
[15:54:03] <paul_irish> something like that
[15:54:09] <paul_irish> @rioter was exploring that idea
[15:54:28] <m_gol> plus what I said earlier, blackboxing files, not only patterns
[15:54:46] <m_gol> e.g. if you use jQuery, most jQuery plugins have "jquery" somewhere in their name
[15:55:07] <m_gol> and you might want to debug them as their quality is less certain
[15:55:30] <m_gol> which makes for some complicated patterns to black-box jQuery without plugins etc.
[16:43:33] <ajpiano> ralphholzmann: DaveMethvin you guys should talk to each other about a thing
[17:11:37] <m_gol> `tell paul_irish do you know anyone from the WebKit team that could be pinged about issues ready to be resolved? I'd love to get these flex prefixes out in https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98420 but now it's outside of your scope. :)
[17:11:37] <b-ot> m_gol: Iâ€™ll tell paul_irish about that.
[17:11:42] <paul_irish> .
[17:11:42] <b-ot> paul_irish: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[17:11:54] <paul_irish> webkitttttt
[17:12:10] <paul_irish> lol your comments there the other night were funny
[17:12:15] <m_gol> ah, you're still here :)
[17:12:56] <m_gol> on the bug? ;) I messed up versions a little, but I hate prefixes so much I'd love sb from the WebKit team to look at this issue :)
[17:13:19] <paul_irish> i am not too hopeful
[17:13:32] <m_gol> :(
[17:13:36] <paul_irish> i dont know a good contact for it
[17:13:45] <paul_irish> but i think you should try.
[17:13:59] <paul_irish> drop into #webkit during pacific working hours and ask
[17:14:16] <paul_irish> smfr is a good dude and maybe you could ask him who a better person to ask is
[17:14:16] <m_gol> k, thx for the advice!
