[06:43:25] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I see you've started seriously going through issues :)
[06:43:31] <DaveMethvin> yep
[06:43:37] <DaveMethvin> trying to keep up with them now
[06:43:49] <m_gol> the downside of the migration is that it's hard for me to filter bug reports I'm involved in since 90% of them were auto-created from my account :P
[06:44:06] <DaveMethvin> :(
[06:44:29] <m_gol> I'll submit a PR with clean ups for master once my large one for compat lands; it seems we'll be able to save some more space
[06:44:49] <DaveMethvin> i guess there's no way to have it be owned by someone else now
[06:44:59] <DaveMethvin> if it helps you could tag the migrated ones or something
[06:45:37] <m_gol> it's not a huge problem; if I filter ones reported by me then I just need to look at newer than migration :)
[06:45:48] <m_gol> since there were few bug reports before that
[06:46:00] <m_gol> assignments are fine, I auto-migrated them as well with my monster script
[06:46:54] <m_gol> I hope the PR is ready now. :) I'd love to land it on Monday after the meeting; it's nice we'll be able to drop forcing zoom on body and using custom JSON parser
[06:47:15] <m_gol> those are quite inconvenient/dangerous
[06:49:20] <m_gol> btw, BrowserStack now has Windows Phone, we should start testing on that!
[06:49:44] <DaveMethvin> only if we pass already :)
[06:49:55] <m_gol> I guess I'll start with Sizzle, it's not getting recognized on TestSwarm for some reason and debuggin that requires going through a gazillion of abstraction layers
[06:50:11] <m_gol> but I've run the suite manually and we only fail 2 tests :)
[06:50:35] <m_gol> it's going to go to the periodic run so it may fail a few at the beginning
[06:51:27] <m_gol> each time I add a new browser to TestSwarm I hope it'll work and I won't have to debug anything :P
[06:51:51] <DaveMethvin> optimist!
[06:53:17] <m_gol> regexes from ua-parser, testswarm-browserstack, node-browserstack, the BrowserStack API, UA of the browser... everything has to match or it jus fails kinda silently
[06:54:24] <m_gol> so I usually just try a couple of variants in separate commits and only if all of them fail I know I have to debug
[06:54:31] <m_gol> which is the case here
[06:54:38] <m_gol> it's probably something trivial
[06:55:13] <m_gol> it's just the question of which of a tousand of trivial problems is this one :P

[10:37:45] <arthurvr> Hi guys! Somebody really needs to get over some PRs in the learn.jquery.com repo
[10:37:59] <arthurvr> Some are open for months :-(
[10:38:34] <DaveMethvin> hey arthurvr! You've been pretty active on comments, are you interested in doing more?
[10:39:04] <DaveMethvin> i agree it takes a while sometimes, we just need more folks helping out
[10:39:09] <arthurvr> What do you mean exactly by doing more?
[10:39:20] <arthurvr> If I can I‚Äôm wanting to help always ;-)
[10:39:38] <DaveMethvin> reviewing PRs, even being a maintainer on that site perhaps?
[10:40:32] <arthurvr> Maintaining is kinda much at the moment, but reviewing some PRs must be possible!
[10:40:44] <arthurvr> I‚Äôd love to help if I can!
[10:41:15] <DaveMethvin> that would be easy then, just take a look at the issues already there and see if they look reasonable. If there's not a pull request you could create one
[10:41:57] <DaveMethvin> even if it still needs work, your PR can be a starting point to get things going
[10:42:05] <arthurvr> Perfect. Hope I can help!
[10:42:12] <DaveMethvin> awesome!
[11:22:34] <arthurvr> DaveMethvin: Did 4 PRs right now, this night I‚Äôil do some more + review some other PRs ;-)
[11:46:09] <DaveMethvin> awesome, thanks arthurvr!
