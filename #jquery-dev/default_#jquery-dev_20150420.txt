[10:02:00] <dcherman> if i can weigh in on the htmlPrefilter discussion - implementing it via duck punching behavior might have issues down the road
[10:02:14] <dcherman> in the sense that it's impossible to remove your filter without potentially affecting others that were added
[10:04:41] <m_gol> dcherman: why would you want to remove a filter, though?
[10:05:36] <m_gol> markelog: same impression ;)
[10:05:38] <dcherman> consider a SPA where you might mix in behaviors in some views and not in others - you may want to remove said filter when it's not applicable
[10:05:47] <dcherman> i don't have a concrete use case at the moment
[10:05:57] <dcherman> but i implemented exactly what you're talking about for a different use case
[10:06:00] <dcherman> and i regret it
[10:06:13] <DaveMethvin> if there are multiple people punching that access point i think there is a problem in the project
[10:06:26] <DaveMethvin> it's not something that has local impact, it's global
[10:06:46] <m_gol> and if an SPA controls the whole process & they need conditional filters, they may keep an array themselves and use it in their prefilter impl
[10:06:49] <DaveMethvin> so thinking you can firewall off the effects and chain callers is probably not a good thing to imply
[10:09:47] <snover> dcherman: it is not impossible, you just replace the function with one that introduces indirection to your actual callbacks and then donâ€™t remove your function even if you remove your callbacks. see e.g. dojo/aspect.
[10:10:28] <m_gol> snover: yep, that's more or less what I suggested, except I phrased it uglier :-)
[10:10:53] <snover> and you can test to see if someone else has changed the function since you changed it so you can actually 100% restore it if nobody else added something after you
[10:11:36] <dcherman> snover: the trick with that is that if someone did add a function after you, then you must mutate your function's definition to essentially become an identity fn
[10:11:57] <dcherman> but if you're not careful about nulling out variables in that specific case, it's incredibly easy to create memory leaks
[10:12:03] <dcherman> i did it :/
[10:12:36] <snover> guess you should have just used dojo/aspect ;)
[10:28:43] <markelog> dcherman: perhaps, you should voice you concerns in the https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2203
[10:47:56] <dcherman> markelog: ya, i can do that.  will make a note to do it before i head out today.
