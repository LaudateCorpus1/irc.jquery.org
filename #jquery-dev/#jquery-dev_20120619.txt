[08:36:09] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] When detecting html in init, ignore html characters within quotes, brackets, and parens as well as escaped characters which are valid in selectors. Fixes #11290. - timmywil
[08:36:11] <gnarf> Out of curiosity, do we have a jenkins test for sizzle?
[08:37:57] <timmywil> gnarf: sry, I'm not sure what you mean.
[08:39:20] <timmywil> for Sizzle's independent suite?
[08:39:29] <gnarf> like does Sizzle get built/swarmed on its own
[08:39:34] <gnarf> or just as a part of jQuery
[08:39:48] <gnarf> cuz we should prolly setup the former?
[08:41:06] <timmywil> yea, I don't think it does.
[08:41:34] <timmywil> but if all of the tests pass in jQuery, I'm happy with that
[08:42:10] <gnarf> jzaefferer: think we could get a Jenkins job for sizzle?
[08:49:31] <jzaefferer> gnarf: sure
[08:50:20] <jzaefferer> timmywil: does Sizzle have its own suite of unit tests?
[08:50:39] <jzaefferer> looks like that
[08:50:55] <jzaefferer> but no grunt yet
[08:52:00] <jzaefferer> we should get grunt.js in place first - lint and qunit tasks (phantom), then can add a testswarm task
[08:52:20] <jzaefferer> I can take care of that eventually, but not today
[08:52:37] <timmywil> agreed, thanks man
[08:53:19] <jzaefferer> you don't need to me set up grunt anyway ;)

[10:04:19] <ircjsbot> rwaldron, you have one new message, from voodootikigod (16 hours and 19 minutes ago). Tell me if you want to read it (“read”).
[10:04:33] <rworth> rwaldron hey
[10:04:34] <rwaldron> ircjsbot read
[10:04:35] <ircjsbot> rwaldron, from voodootikigod, 16 hours and 19 minutes ago: to ping me
[10:04:42] <rwaldron> rworth heyo pm
[10:12:47] <rwaldron> ugh
[10:13:00] <rwaldron> ?tell DaveMethvin ping me when you get in
[10:13:01] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.

[13:17:41] <Krinkle> [jquery.photos.js:12] Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'top' of null

[13:17:47] <Krinkle> ^_^
[13:47:00] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[13:47:29] <timmywil> rwaldron: yo
[13:47:32] <rwaldron> hey
[13:47:59] <timmywil> haven't seen you in a bit
[13:48:05] <rwaldron> document.getElementById was in init to shortcut initializing and improve perf
[13:48:28] <rwaldron> i've been here, but i was away most of last week
[13:49:21] <timmywil> yes I know, but the loss is negligible with Sizzle also providing id optimization
[13:49:40] <timmywil> and more fully since it also accounts for element-rooted id queries
[13:50:09] <rwaldron> the whole point of that path was limiting the stack size in oldIE
[13:50:31] <rwaldron> it might be negligible in chrome 100, but I bet IE7 suffers
[13:52:51] <timmywil> I understand, but the stack size was increased by 2 (making it still less than any other selections)
[13:53:00] <timmywil> and the amount in those functions is small
[13:53:16] <timmywil> Dave and I talked about it first
[13:54:06] <timmywil> stack size is important, but going from 2-4 should not be an issue even in IE7
[13:54:35] <timmywil> plus it saves us from duplicating all of the id matching code
[13:54:46] <timmywil> about -90

[14:25:39] <bot-t> (4 hours 12 mins ago) <rwaldron> tell DaveMethvin ping me when you get in
[14:25:58] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[14:26:00] <rwaldron> tooo late
[14:26:00] <DaveMethvin> sup bud
[14:26:16] <rwaldron> i was prepping for an interview
[14:26:19] <DaveMethvin> awww
[14:26:33] <DaveMethvin> like what kind of interview
[14:27:04] <rwaldron> chris williams podcast
[14:27:09] <DaveMethvin> oh
[14:27:16] <rwaldron> i had to pad everything I said about jquery with "hypothetical"
[14:27:19] <DaveMethvin> spill ALL the beans!
[14:27:21] <rwaldron> "experimental"
[14:27:27] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:27:50] <rwaldron> they wanted to know about the future
[14:27:58] <DaveMethvin> i'm on the train so i may disconnect
[14:28:01] <DaveMethvin> the F U T U R E
[14:28:13] <DaveMethvin> the world ends in december 2012
[14:28:13] <DaveMethvin> makes our job easier
[14:28:23] <rwaldron> so i said, we're hypothetically going to use our unit tests to make an experimental "attempt" at possibly building a lighter jQuery
[14:28:50] <DaveMethvin> i  think we're gonna have a lot of fun over the next 6 months
[14:28:58] <rwaldron> same here
[14:29:29] <rwaldron> that version of jQuery, I suspect, will be svelt.
[14:29:48] <DaveMethvin> very
[14:30:07] <DaveMethvin> i'm sharpening my machete
[14:30:50] * rwaldron starts up chainsaw
[14:31:00] * rwaldron maniacal laughter
[14:31:39] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: imma send you a ppt with my draft keynote
[14:31:40] <DaveMethvin> oh god, uploads on a train
[14:31:48] <rwaldron> snakes?
[14:31:59] <DaveMethvin> snakes would be a quicker death

[17:26:13] <timmywil> ?tell DaveMethvin sooo, I'm running a bunch of perf tests now and I'm thinking perhaps we should add back matchesSelector. You know those bytes we shaved? :) Some of them are here: https://github.com/timmywil/sizzle/commit/f50989bf92f90d219a5f09b44d98b8b824ab8aa9#L0R637
[17:26:13] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[17:26:13] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on sizzle by timmywil (16m, 34s ago): Add back matchesSelector support (with all browser versions). The speed is too great to give up.  Related: http://jsperf.com/jquery-id-init/3
