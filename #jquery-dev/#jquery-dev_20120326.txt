[07:01:12] <Haprog> I've made a simple fiddle that fails in IE8 and older with a javascript error when using the html5shiv and jquery 1.7.2 or 1.7.1, but works on IE9 and other browsers. http://fiddle.jshell.net/Haprog/5MnDG/show/ Anyone know if there's a bug report made for this? I suspect it has something to do with: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6485 or http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10501 but I'm not sure.

[09:59:26] <Haprog> I'll try my luck reposting what I posted earlier in case someone didn't notice it before...:
[09:59:33] <Haprog> I've made a simple fiddle that fails in IE8 and older with a javascript error when using the html5shiv and jquery 1.7.2 or 1.7.1, but works on IE9 and other browsers. http://fiddle.jshell.net/Haprog/5MnDG/show/ Anyone know if there's a bug report made for this? I suspect it has something to do with: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6485 or http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10501 but I'm not sure.
[10:01:30] <Haprog> I was working on an AJAX application that completely stopped working on IE8 and older because of this issue, before I figured out what was the cause and found the workaround that's mentioned in the JS comments of that fiddle.
[10:05:05] <Haprog> Is this a known issue or should I make a bug report?
[10:09:42] <Haprog> And I thought I wouldn't need to worry about HTML5 AJAX issues with IE anymore since jQuery 1.7. I guess some things have been fixed/enhanced but this issue still persists.
[10:10:29] <ajpiano> Haprog: have you checked on the jquery (edge) version
[10:12:17] <Haprog> nope. I could do that though
[10:12:34] <ajpiano> do so and then if it is still broken, create a bug report
[10:12:55] <Haprog> I forgot about edge. I'll test it soon.
[10:14:48] <Haprog> problem persist on edge
[10:14:50] <Haprog> http://fiddle.jshell.net/Haprog/5MnDG/8/show/
[11:10:03] <Haprog> ticket created. http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11521 please discuss if you know something I don't.

[11:26:37] <rwaldron> ajpiano I just pinged jdalton for assistance on the 11521
[11:26:55] <ajpiano> nice
[11:26:59] <ajpiano> he never met a nut he didn't like to crack
[11:27:10] <ajpiano> rwaldron: jonathanneal just started a job today
[11:27:10] <ajpiano> as like
[11:27:16] <ajpiano> full time open source researcher at liferay
[11:27:19] <rwaldron> well, he wrote most of the latest html5shiv
[11:27:32] <rwaldron> cool
[11:55:39] <snover> what is an “open source researcher”?
[11:56:46] <ajpiano> ask him?
[11:59:30] <rwaldron> a guy that spends time figuring out how to re-define document methods with longer method names then they already have
[11:59:33] <rwaldron> snover ^
[11:59:35] <Haprog> rwaldron: Thanks for the feedback on #11521 Works with the html5shiv edge version :)
[11:59:56] <Haprog> you are awesome
[11:59:57] <rwaldron> Haprog np - but dont thank me! thank jdalton
[11:59:58] <snover> rwaldron: thanks
[12:00:30] <rwaldron> Haprog: "/msg jdalton thanks for the html5shiv!"
[12:00:33] <rwaldron> :)
[12:00:36] <Haprog> rwaldron: sure :)
[13:03:40] <gnarf> damnit, you guys are gonna make me pack my bowling ball???
[13:03:44] <gnarf> :)
[13:06:04] <ajpiano> wait, are you *way* better than everyone else now or something
[13:08:06] <gnarf> i haven't bowled in years - but i carry a ~180 average
[14:01:31] <bigbluehat> rwaldron: I'd like to comment on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/716 can you re-open comments?
[14:01:32] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by BigBlueHat (5h, 14m ago): added Shiv check so show/hide work with Modernizr
[14:02:01] <bigbluehat> switching to using a class doesn't fix the real issue: http://jsfiddle.net/BigBlueHat/mLLL5/
[14:17:35] <bigbluehat> rwaldron: comment posted here as GH comments are still locked for that issue: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11520#comment:2
[14:32:17] <mikesherov> rwaldron: you here?
[14:32:36] <mikesherov> looks like we were wrong about that edge case: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11520
[14:32:50] <mikesherov> I made a reduced test case: http://jsfiddle.net/mLLL5/2/
[14:33:22] <bigbluehat> mikesherov: thanks for jumping on this
[14:33:27] <bigbluehat> also, nice test case :)
[14:33:34] * bigbluehat will use Firebug Lite in future
[14:33:37] <mikesherov> yeah, it clearly demonstrates what's going on
[14:33:53] <mikesherov> well, it's just that your test case provided an easy red herring
[14:34:01] <mikesherov> so we all assumed it was that
[14:34:10] <bigbluehat> ah, what was that?
[14:34:16] <bigbluehat> the article{display:none} bit?
[14:34:21] <mikesherov> yeah
[14:34:37] <mikesherov> I mean, the `article: none` would definitely also cause that
[14:35:07] <bigbluehat> yeah, didn't realize it'd throw it off like that...makes sense, though
[14:35:28] <bigbluehat> I've switched my code to use .hide (using Bootstrap)
[14:35:46] <bigbluehat> I'm also happy to clean up my patch or do other work on getting this sorted, if that's at all helpful
[14:35:48] <bigbluehat> just let me know :)
[14:36:22] <mikesherov> Yeah, I can tell you that detecting modernizr and specifically working around that won't get merged
[14:36:35] <bigbluehat> yeah, didn't think so, actually
[14:36:41] <bigbluehat> just wasn't sure how to come at the problem differently
[14:36:55] <mikesherov> The solution will most likely involve fixing the first console.log to do the right thing
[14:37:20] <bigbluehat> gotcha.
[14:37:26] <mikesherov> namely: jQuery("<article/>").appendTo(document.body).css("display") should return block;
[14:37:33] <bigbluehat> right.
[14:37:42] <mikesherov> if you can navigate that code, and get that to work, AWESOME
[14:37:54] <bigbluehat> :) I'll definitely muck into it again tomorrow
[14:38:00] * bigbluehat has been summoned to dinner
[14:38:06] <bigbluehat> thanks for jumping in on this mikesherov
[14:38:07] <mikesherov> Enjoy dinner
[14:38:12] <bigbluehat> will do.
[14:38:13] <mikesherov> thanks for being persistent!
[14:38:18] <bigbluehat> happy to!

[14:40:27] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[14:50:34] <rwaldron> mikesherov
[14:50:35] <bot-t> (10 mins 8 secs ago) <mikesherov> tell rwaldron that he is handsome and oh yeah we were wrong about that edge case: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11520 http://jsfiddle.net/mLLL5/2/

[14:50:54] <rwaldron>  http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/mLLL5/5/show/light
[14:51:10] <rwaldron> that ticket and subsequently your fiddle are all using the broken html5shiv
[14:51:25] <rwaldron> its a known issue that has been fixed by html5shiv devs
[14:51:49] <rwaldron> ?tell mikesherov see all of the above.
[14:51:49] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
[15:03:17] <DaveMethvin> geez, who turned on the  tractor beam for the bug tracker today? rwaldron? sindresorhus?
[15:04:14] <Eviltwin> I decided to make a new bug for every time someone's come in to #jQuery saying they found a bug in jQuery from the last year.
[15:04:55] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin have you seen idiocracy?
[15:04:59] <DaveMethvin> Eviltwin: then you still have a LOT of bug making to do
[15:05:03] <DaveMethvin> yep rwaldron
[15:05:13] <DaveMethvin> it still bug, fix it
[15:05:22] <rwaldron> our bug tracker is hosting the casting party for the sequel
[15:06:07] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin did you review our meeting notes?
[15:06:19] <DaveMethvin> haven't done it yet, just got caught up on email
[15:06:26] <DaveMethvin> in a voice conf call now
[15:06:51] <rwaldron> oh
[15:06:54] <rwaldron> no worries
[15:06:59] <rwaldron> it went smoothly
[15:07:05] <rwaldron> everything is in the doc
[15:07:08] <rwaldron> I'm heading out
[15:07:30] <DaveMethvin> i'll try to hop on later
[15:12:28] <Eviltwin> Does jQuery have a Freenode project cloak?
[15:15:42] <ajpiano> i don't believe so
[15:21:01] <mikesherov> rwaldron: you're tright
[15:21:02] <bot-t> (29 mins 10 secs ago) <rwaldron> tell mikesherov see all of the above.
[15:21:07] <mikesherov> :-\
[15:21:59] <mikesherov> rwaldron: it's not my fault the tool we tell all of our bug reporters to use has a bug in it!
[15:24:23] <mikesherov> here's an idea: submit a fiddle in this busted ass thing
[16:01:53] <mikesherov> .
[16:02:03] <mikesherov> HTML5SHIV
[16:02:15] <mikesherov> It's a shiv that stabs you in the face
[16:02:33] <mikesherov> Can't oldIE just die already?
[16:06:46] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: you here?
[16:06:46] <mikesherov_> nvm
[16:11:19] <mikesherov_> ?pr
[16:11:20] <bot-t> jQuery Core Pull Request Queue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pulls
[16:14:47] <bigbluehat> mikesherov_: sadly, the saga continues... http://jsfiddle.net/89WBB/2/
[16:15:10] <bigbluehat> this one's using Modernizr 2.5.3, adding a .hide class to hide the article, then using show() to do what it should
[16:15:22] <bigbluehat> article ends up as 'inline' after the .show()
[16:15:29] <bigbluehat> in IE 8
[16:16:07] <mikesherov_> right, but it's using the busted htmls5shiv
[16:16:38] <bigbluehat> ?
[16:16:45] <bigbluehat> Modernizr uses the busted html5shiv?
[16:17:24] <bigbluehat> also, fwiw, .hide() then .show() works as it should: http://jsfiddle.net/6etCM/1/
[16:20:32] <mikesherov_> um
[16:20:33] <mikesherov_> hold on a sec
[16:22:23] <mikesherov_> yes, it uses html5shiv 3.4
[16:23:23] <mikesherov_> .
[16:23:50] <Eviltwin> Really shouldn't shiv change to accomodate jQuery?
[16:24:01] <Eviltwin> That'd be a lot easier
[16:25:41] <mikesherov_> they had a regression
[16:25:49] <mikesherov_> they fixed it
[16:25:55] <mikesherov_> it hasn't found it's way yet into all the libs
[16:25:56] <bigbluehat> so what's the "good" version?
[16:26:38] <bigbluehat> 3.4 seems to be the latest http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/source/list
[16:27:52] <mikesherov_> honestly, I'm not sure.
[16:27:54] <bigbluehat> I guess this is the fix? https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv/commit/9aa5bcdca367fd86ec5d5b73ca4d95e032a0f502
[16:27:55] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on html5shiv by aFarkas (1d, 2h ago): do not cache html5 elements fixes issue #54 (thx to @jamesreggio)
[16:27:59] <bigbluehat> so it's not even released yet...
[16:28:59] <bigbluehat> Eviltwin: fwiw, I'd hoped this was a shiv bug before I reported it...glad that's the case
[16:29:23] <mikesherov_> Point is, this is now off-topic for jQUery
[16:29:40] <mikesherov_> rwaldron already beat me into submission :-P
[16:31:15] <bigbluehat> yeah...I get that...
[16:32:22] <mikesherov_> if you want to know where the regression exactly is, keep testing each version of html5shiv starting at edge, until it breaks
[16:32:25] <mikesherov_> then open a PR on modernizr
[16:37:12] <bigbluehat> yeah, looks like it's their most recent commit that fixes the node cache
[16:41:25] <bigbluehat> mikesherov_: yeah, their commit from *yesterday* is what fixes the bug
[16:41:34] <bigbluehat> here's a fiddle using the commit just prior: http://jsfiddle.net/6etCM/2/
[18:33:14] <xion-db> hello guys have someone try jquery flexigrid with success, under php? i can get the json variable but when run the funtion, this not show me anytable...
[18:59:23] <gnarf> ?channels @xion-db
[18:59:23] <bot-t> xion-db, For support please go to #jquery or #jquerymobile. Development Channels: #jquery-dev - #jqueryui-dev - #jquerymobile-dev ; Meetings held in#jquery-meeting
[23:27:21] <gnarf> Eviltwin: thanks for the sarcasm, i decided to just start ignoring him, but you made me laugh after i got back :)
[23:30:25] <Eviltwin> Always love it when people say they found a bug in jQuery
[23:30:49] <Eviltwin> By which they mean it doesn't work how they expected, it works how it's documented instead
