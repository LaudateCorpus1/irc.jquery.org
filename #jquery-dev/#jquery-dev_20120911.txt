[10:46:50] <gnarf> johnbender: shared folders are annoying, but they work pretty decently
[10:47:05] <gnarf> its pretty doable if you turn off "readfile"
[10:47:17] <gnarf> or whatever that thing is

[13:10:52] <DaveMethvin> haha
[13:11:42] <DaveMethvin> if only that would have fixed it
[13:11:46] <DaveMethvin> i would be happy
[13:12:00] <DaveMethvin> it looks like i'll have to install ngnix
[13:12:07] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: :(
[13:12:45] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: we're definitely playing some games like doing a POST to an html page
[13:12:49] <DaveMethvin> so those we should fix
[13:13:04] <DaveMethvin> but these ones i am not sure what is going on
[13:17:31] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: where is the view that shows you a commit per line in a table with the rows being the modules?
[13:18:07] <gnarf> huh?
[13:18:11] <DaveMethvin> in testswarm
[13:18:30] <DaveMethvin> there is a view that shows a table with one row per commit
[13:18:52] <gnarf> ?swarm
[13:18:53] <bot-t> Swarm Status: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/qunit/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerycolor/ -- Jenkins http://swarm.jquery.org:8080
[13:18:53] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Not with modules in columns though.
[13:18:54] <gnarf> that one?
[13:19:10] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery
[13:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> This is the only view I know of that has commits as columns: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery
[13:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> s/columns/rows/
[13:19:24] <gnarf> dunno why it doesn't like the trailing slash there
[13:19:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's it
[13:19:38] <DaveMethvin> and i had a trailing slash
[13:19:50] <gnarf> ?swarm
[13:19:50] <bot-t> Swarm Status: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui http://swarm.jquery.org/user/qunit http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerycolor -- Jenkins http://swarm.jquery.org:8080
[13:19:53] <gnarf> updated factoid
[13:20:11] <DaveMethvin> did anything about the server setup change on Sept 6?
[13:20:30] <DaveMethvin> we're consistently failing now but the commit where it started failing didn't change ajax
[13:21:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if i go to http://swarm.jquery.org/build/jquery/9c5089a60d479a959b290a5b4ab8ef38c985e963/test/index.html?module=ajax in chrome
[13:21:54] <gnarf> it doesn't fail
[13:21:58] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: not that I'm aware of
[13:22:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: something might of changed about browserstack clients *shrug*
[13:22:24] <DaveMethvin> ah, true
[13:22:44] <DaveMethvin> and also, we're prolly both using Chrome 21 anyways
[13:23:34] <gnarf> that url fails chrome 20 windows on browserstack
[13:23:58] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[13:24:47] <gnarf> it passes chrome 20 mac
[13:37:12] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: emailed Browserstack support
[14:01:07] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: good luck
[14:01:09] <gnarf> :)
[14:38:10] <paul_irish> did anyone turn a jquery builder into a webapp yet?
[14:38:17] <paul_irish> gnarf: ^
[14:42:42] <paul_irish> because Iszak is thinking about it
[14:42:48] <paul_irish> and didnt want to duplicate efforts
[15:13:48] <Eviltwin> I call function3 "how to screw over most JavaScript developers": http://jsfiddle.net/WSxdN/
[16:03:31] <sonotos> Eviltwin: well that's why there is no question in wich line the braces have to be in js code conventions
[16:14:10] <DaveMethvin> Eviltwin: http://www.jshint.com/reports/751062
[18:00:14] <sizcommit> [sizzle] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/-hi1qA
[18:00:14] <sizcommit> [sizzle/master] Add console profiling to speed comparisons if available. - Timmy Willison
[18:12:17] <mikesherov> So, DaveMethvin, any interest in the new JSHint features?
[18:12:33] <DaveMethvin> which ones are those?
[18:12:46] <mikesherov> Well, first of all, enforce double quotes
[18:13:04] <mikesherov> but all the new max* options
[18:13:22] <mikesherov> maxparams, maxdepth, maxcomplexity...
[18:13:42] <DaveMethvin> if it allows exceptions for internal double quotes ... :)
[18:13:49] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at the max* ones
[18:13:49] <mikesherov> maxstatements
[18:14:03] <mikesherov> oh man, I love cyclomatic complexity enforcement
[18:14:27] <mikesherov> internal double quotes?
[18:14:40] <DaveMethvin> 'this is "quoted" inside'
[18:14:54] <DaveMethvin> "this is \"a pain\" and ugly"
[18:14:58] <mikesherov> "this is \"quoted\" inside"
[18:15:02] <DaveMethvin> haha
[18:15:21] <DaveMethvin> backslashes are a slipperly slope
[18:15:24] <DaveMethvin> LITERALLY!
[18:15:39] <mikesherov> so then we aren't interested in double quotes enforcement...
[18:15:48] <mikesherov> I'm going to just see how many fails we have :-)
[18:15:51] <DaveMethvin> i worked for mccabe back in the 1980s, his company was based here in maryland
[18:17:05] <DaveMethvin> warnings about complexity would be interesting
[18:19:20] <mikesherov> So, I'd have to update grunt to do so...
[18:19:27] <mikesherov> forgot we don't control jshint anymore
[18:26:59] <DaveMethvin> so mikesherov have you ever used/written a web crawler for node?
[18:27:15] <mikesherov> a web crawler, no
[18:27:30] <DaveMethvin> there are a few out there, i'm tryna get at least one to work
[18:28:30] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to see if I could have something crawl sites and tell me what was being used in jquery
[18:28:49] <DaveMethvin> but that takes it beyond the typical crawler that uses really ugly regexes
[18:32:48] <mikesherov> regexes???
[18:32:51] <mikesherov> tsk tsk
[18:32:57] <mikesherov> parsing HTML with regex?
[18:33:02] <mikesherov> :-P
[18:34:01] <mikesherov> so, just so you know, we could turn quotmark "double" on in core, with zero fails, and not enable it in the tests, which have about 80 errors
[18:34:30] <DaveMethvin> that's true, it's more of a problem in tests than in the main code
[18:34:41] <DaveMethvin> it's mainly when you want to mix them in markup for a test
[18:34:45] <DaveMethvin> so i'd be down with that
[18:35:11] <mikesherov> I could easily clean them up in tests too
[18:35:39] <mikesherov> we could always switch from '<img src"sdskd" />' to "<img src'dsdfds' />"
[18:35:48] <DaveMethvin> so the max* stuff
[18:35:54] <mikesherov> yeah, it's awesome
[18:36:07] <mikesherov> SNAP (my company) has a PR bot, called mergeatron
[18:36:24] <mikesherov> which we should be using instead of bot.io, btw :-P
[18:36:32] <DaveMethvin> that would be great
[18:36:43] <mikesherov> it already has true pull checking ability integration
[18:37:10] <mikesherov> https://github.com/blog/1227-commit-status-api
[18:37:21] <mikesherov> it currently polls...
[18:37:23] <mikesherov> not ideal
[18:37:36] <DaveMethvin> well as long as it's not too aggressive
[18:37:37] <mikesherov> has jenkins integration, etc.
[18:37:57] <DaveMethvin> we usually have plenty of time to let a pr settle
[18:38:10] <mikesherov> We're changing it to do on-demand
[18:38:10] <DaveMethvin> so even a slow bot should be able to keep up
[18:38:23] <mikesherov> so, it auto tests new pulls
[18:38:32] <DaveMethvin> that would be useful
[18:38:35] <mikesherov> it retests on rebase
[18:38:43] <mikesherov> or any code update
[18:38:54] <DaveMethvin> so, by the time we did code reviews we'd know it passed jshint style checks and unit tests
[18:38:55] <mikesherov> and you can even call it to retest on demand
[18:39:00] <mikesherov> exactly
[18:39:12] <DaveMethvin> that would be a time saver
[18:39:19] <mikesherov> Yes
[18:39:32] <mikesherov> and so, it has github and jenkins plugins
[18:39:40] <mikesherov> to do all that stuff
[18:39:51] <mikesherov> we're actively developing it and figuring out licensing shortly
[18:40:10] <mikesherov> 99% sure it'll be MIT
[18:40:24] <mikesherov> but anyway, I just introduced cyclomatic complexity detection
[18:40:35] <mikesherov> and it finds awesome things that can be cleaned up
[18:41:47] <mikesherov> jQuery.clean has complexity of 22!
[18:42:08] <DaveMethvin> w o w
[18:42:26] <DaveMethvin> but then again, foreaches with nested functions tend to get you kind of deep
[18:42:37] <mikesherov> sure
[18:42:45] <mikesherov> we have 2 functions with scores of 22
[18:42:49] <mikesherov> trigger and clean
[18:43:13] <mikesherov> and just LOOK at trigger
[18:43:23] <DaveMethvin> so does it have an analysis report?
[18:44:09] <mikesherov> you just set maxcomplexity
[18:44:15] <mikesherov> to whatever number you want
[18:44:20] <mikesherov> and it fails the ones who are over
[18:44:27] <mikesherov> and tells you the complexity of the ones that are over
[18:44:36] <mikesherov> I can set it to 10 and see what happens
[18:44:41] <mikesherov> I'll paste you the output
[18:45:09] <DaveMethvin> oh that reminds me
[18:45:18] <DaveMethvin> gotta open a ticket for trigger
[18:47:42] <mikesherov> http://oksoclap.com/Kglmd1uvaT
[18:48:41] <mikesherov> we could probably get away with 17 as the threshold and only have to clean up a few things
[18:49:21] <DaveMethvin> i suspect a lot of that will clean up naturally with 2.0
[18:51:33] <mikesherov> sure, just an interesting thing to keep an eye on
[18:51:38] <mikesherov> maxdepth is cool too
[18:51:41] <mikesherov> nesting level
[18:52:49] <mikesherov> this time nesting level culprit is cleanData
[18:53:15] <mikesherov> we could easily gaurd clause that instead of doing work inside the if
[18:53:24] <DaveMethvin> true
[18:53:24] <mikesherov> those are easier than reducing cyclomatic complexity
[18:53:33] <DaveMethvin> i like early-out
[18:53:42] <mikesherov> agreed
[18:53:47] <mikesherov> proven clarity tactic
[18:54:05] <mikesherov> easier to parse in the mind than keeping track of the ifs in your head
[18:54:29] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: i would ping ariya at sencha, who did a few analyses using esprima across a big corpous
[18:54:50] <mikesherov> paul_irish: yeah, esprima would be cool for this too
[18:54:53] <DaveMethvin> thanks paul_irish!
[18:54:58] <mikesherov> jshint is switching to esprima, right?
[18:55:10] <DaveMethvin> well you just cannot do any serious crawling with regexp
[18:55:21] <mikesherov> oh, nvm
[18:55:21] <paul_irish> mikesherov: yes
[18:55:35] <mikesherov> wrong convo, you're talking about web crawler, not linting right?
[18:55:45] <DaveMethvin> well both need to parse
[18:55:47] <paul_irish> and the new coffeescript compiler is preferring esmungle which is a new esprima based minifier
[18:55:48] <mikesherov> sure
[18:55:57] <paul_irish> and it just landed sourcemaps, as of 1hr ago
[18:56:14] <mikesherov> uglify is on the way there too
[18:56:14] <DaveMethvin> i hear IE15 will have sourcemaps
[18:56:17] <DaveMethvin> :D
[18:56:19] <mikesherov> LOL
[18:56:30] <paul_irish> mikesherov: yeah. nice 100e donation :D
[18:56:48] <mikesherov> Sucks his paypal got frozen
[18:56:55] <mikesherov> gotta support the guy
[18:57:00] <mikesherov> I use uglify at work
[18:57:07] <mikesherov> saved us way more than 100euro
[18:57:08] <DaveMethvin> even if we ended up using something else, we built up quite a debt with uglify :)
[18:57:09] <paul_irish> wait realy
[18:57:13] <paul_irish> mikesherov: where did he say that
[18:57:21] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: a debt?
[18:57:22] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: it was frozen all weekend
[18:57:29] <DaveMethvin> debt of gratitude
[18:57:32] <paul_irish> o
[18:57:45] <DaveMethvin> just got unfrozen last night
[18:57:53] <DaveMethvin> i was wondering why nobody was donating
[18:58:02] <DaveMethvin> and then i saw a blog update about it
[18:58:12] <DaveMethvin> but he's good now i think
[18:58:12] <paul_irish> on mihai's blog?
[18:58:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[18:58:16] <paul_irish> k
[18:58:28] <paul_irish> it looks like Chrome is going to donate too
[18:58:35] <DaveMethvin> nice
[18:59:03] <mikesherov> they mustve fixed it
[18:59:09] <mikesherov> two days ago, it was frozen
[18:59:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah mihai said he had to send some sort of paperwork to paypal
[18:59:29] <DaveMethvin> "imma person, not a scammer!"
[18:59:32] <mikesherov> LOL
[19:00:35] <mikesherov> ben_alman: wait will it take to update grunt's jshint version to latest?
[19:00:37] <mikesherov> what*
[19:01:26] <mikesherov> I need max nesting depth!
[19:06:06] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: jquery and dojo and telerik all kicked in 500e right?
[19:06:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah paul_irish
[19:06:34] <paul_irish> I got budget for more but don't wanna come across as douchey if our contribution is bigger :/
[19:06:34] <DaveMethvin> and i think we said we'd kick another 500 if he reached the goal
[19:06:44] <paul_irish> ah! problem solved
[19:06:47] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:07:03] <DaveMethvin> so contribute $1001 paul_irish
[19:07:10] <paul_irish> Aahahahaha
[19:07:13] <mikesherov> LOL
[19:07:35] <paul_irish> $1000.01 . Let's be frugal here
[19:07:47] <paul_irish> sweet. payment is paypal, right?
[19:07:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah, google's not made of mo...wait, it is
[19:07:54] <paul_irish> ahaha
[19:07:59] <DaveMethvin> right paypal only
[19:08:01] <DaveMethvin> afaik
[19:08:03] <paul_irish> kk cool.
[19:08:19] <mikesherov> nesting level 8: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L845
[19:08:43] <DaveMethvin> geez that is pretty damn deep nesting mike
[19:09:35] <DaveMethvin> maybe that was done to save a byte or two on "return"?
[19:09:44] <DaveMethvin> i'd prefer to use the bytes
[19:10:30] <mikesherov> weee https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/sizzle.js#L1252
[19:10:35] <DaveMethvin> seems like you could preload that return object
[19:10:41] <mikesherov> sure
[19:10:48] <mikesherov> these are code smells
[19:10:53] <mikesherov> they work just fine
[19:10:59] <mikesherov> but they smell like crap
[19:11:00] <DaveMethvin> damn that's some deeeeeeep nesting
[19:11:17] <DaveMethvin> well it can be a real challenge to nestle into them when you're debugging
[19:11:21] <mikesherov> and it's assignment in conditional
[19:11:30] <mikesherov> as if it wasn't already complex enough
[19:11:56] <mikesherov> anyway, I'm going to see what it'll take to get cowboy to update
[19:12:07] <mikesherov> and then we can decide if we want to enforce any of this stuff
[19:12:34] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[19:14:09] <mikesherov> ok, gotta run
[19:14:25] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[19:17:26] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell ben_alman we should update the jshint version on grunt, I'll gladly include a PR
[19:17:26] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[20:12:03] <paul_irish> jquery is ~3300 lines prettified in chrome
[20:12:10] <paul_irish> helps when finding whats after it ;)
