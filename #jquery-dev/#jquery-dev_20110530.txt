[06:23:42] <jaubourg> I dunno, aren't we?

[06:24:21] <JohnResig> I mean, we /could/ but I doubt that we'll be able to get everyone
[06:24:28] <JohnResig> jaubourg: heya - doing good!
[06:25:56] <jaubourg> coolness
[06:26:16] <jaubourg> 'been working on an alternative to animate more akin to CSS3 animation
[06:26:39] <jaubourg> trying to make it so implementing animate using it wouldn't be too painful
[06:28:02] <JohnResig> hmm, gotchya
[06:28:11] <JohnResig> is this to supplement the current API?
[06:33:44] <jaubourg> I HATE MY FUCKING ISP
[06:33:49] <jaubourg> oh and hi
[06:33:51] * jaubourg hides
[06:34:16] <jaubourg> JohnResig: goal is to test as a plugin and, in the long run, supplement if it proves interesting
[06:34:57] <jaubourg> JohnResig: think I'll have transition support in it but supporting pure CSS3 animation is a bit tricky regarding .stop()
[06:35:13] <JohnResig> jaubourg: hmm, ok
