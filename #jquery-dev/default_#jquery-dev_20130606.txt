[02:44:42] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: Chrome adopted the new //# sourceMappingURL pragma
[02:44:57] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: and they print deprecation warnings if you use //@ :)
[02:45:06] <m_gol> the same for SASS etc.
[05:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle|detached DaveMethvin: Let's just rejoince in the fact that shitty URLs don't work and leave it alone :-)
[05:27:26] <scott_gonzalez> s/rejoince/rejoice/
[05:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> damn, even when I tried to correct my typo I spelled it wrong again and had to go back and fix it. My hand just naturally moves to n after "joi"...
[05:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I thought non-jQuery events were out of scope?
[05:48:08] <scott_gonzalez> This is like "we've never supported quirks mode" all over again :-P
[05:48:18] <scott_gonzalez> 2 non-jQuery event tickets that were marked open this week.
[05:48:29] <DaveMethvin> it seems we should be calling stopImmediatePropagation() on the underlying object
[05:48:38] <DaveMethvin> just like we call stopPropagation
[05:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, we don't do that?
[05:52:33] <scott_gonzalez> I agree we should do that.
[05:53:01] <DaveMethvin> we call stopPropagation instead of stopImmedateProgatoin, which doesn't break for us because we only have one event handler
[05:55:07] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so this would just be something like: try { e.SIP(); } catch( er ) { e.sP(); } ?
[05:55:16] <scott_gonzalez> for 1.x
[05:55:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah basically
[05:55:45] <DaveMethvin> should't really need the try/catch
[05:55:51] <DaveMethvin> we'll see
[05:56:01] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right, just if sIP in
[05:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> I can see why we didn't do this before :-)
[06:16:06] <DaveMethvin> .
[06:18:00] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer this might prove useful in the future https://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md
[06:50:01] <scott_gonzalez_> DaveMethvin: Interesting.
[06:50:53] <DaveMethvin> i've never done a gdocs script so that alone is interesting, could be useful for other things like the cla

[15:27:29] <paul_irish> Krinkle|detached: yup shitty URLs are dead now so that includes jquery /2/
[15:36:14] <DaveMethvin> yay paul_irish!
[16:34:15] <Krinkle> paul_irish: Ah, I see. So it was intentional
[16:34:16] <Krinkle> Great
[16:34:28] <Krinkle> Those were indeed badly cached (naturally)
[16:34:41] <Krinkle> Though they were also convenient as a easy to bookmark url for 
[16:34:44] <Krinkle> "latest jquery source"
[16:34:56] <Krinkle> I suppose we should use code.jquery.com for that instead
