[10:06:13] <m_gol> gibson0421: I'm wondering, what can break if sb is just moving the internal data to a new node that is going to be placed in exactly the same place where the old node was? because that's the what Angular uses it for
[10:06:41] <m_gol> I mean, obviously, theoretically a lot can break as it's all private stuff and you can do a lot in setup/teardown but I wonder if this is issue currently
[10:07:27] <m_gol> maybe that's why they didn't stumble upon bugs related to that, maybe it just accidentally work ;)
[10:07:31] <m_gol> rwaldron ^^^
[10:08:19] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: i think as long as there are no special events hooks the chances are it will work
[10:08:37] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I mean with special hooks
[10:09:14] <m_gol> if it's e.g. moving handling the event do document, it'll still work since the new node is in the same place the old one was
[10:09:37] <m_gol> * to document
[10:09:41] <DaveMethvin> maybe, as long as the _data in the old node was removed so it woudln't be torn down
[10:10:10] <DaveMethvin> it really depends on what the special event does and we don't dictate that
[10:10:31] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: yeah, they remove the old node from the jQuery object manually so it bypasses cleanData
[10:10:35] <m_gol> oh boy, it's messy :D
[10:10:44] <DaveMethvin> for example, someone *could* have a special event hook that looked at the position of the element in the document when the event was attached
[10:10:50] <m_gol> yeah, obviously
[10:11:01] <DaveMethvin> but if they did, their own event would break if the element got moved in the tree :)
[10:11:26] <DaveMethvin> we don't have a special event "moved" handler :)
[10:12:08] <DaveMethvin> i don't think there are a lot of special event hooks outside the ones we use in jquery
[10:12:20] <DaveMethvin> the hoverIntent plugin is one of the few i can think of
[10:39:23] <m_gol> \o/ I'm unblocked
[10:39:53] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: "Make the alias /1 for jQuery point to 1.11.1"  this is going live probaby tomorrow
[10:40:10] <DaveMethvin> yay! thanks paul_irish 
[10:40:20] <DaveMethvin> it seems like 1.11.1 has been stable
[10:40:33] <DaveMethvin> i'll get going on the blog post

[11:21:13] <DaveMethvin> http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/aed236.png
[11:21:13] <Guest50001> It did not create the ticket
[11:21:30] <DaveMethvin> does it show you logged in on the left under TRACKER ACCOUNT?

[11:22:39] <Guest50001> Create New Ticket (bug)
[11:22:52] <Guest50001> Create New Ticket (bug)
[11:23:15] <Guest50001> create ticket does not work
[11:24:32] <DaveMethvin> well now the server seems to be locked up
[11:24:46] <Guest50001> It just worked now
[11:24:47] <DaveMethvin> i am trying to create a ticket and the server wont' respond
[11:24:54] <Guest50001> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15085
[11:25:50] <Guest50001> add a comment now works too
[11:26:11] <DaveMethvin> ok, i think it's working now ... what happened was that it always worked for me but that's because i had an admin account :/
[11:26:22] <Guest50001> LOL
[11:26:25] <DaveMethvin> i just created a DaveUser account for testing :)
[11:26:28] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[11:26:55] <Guest50001> I'll update the q on the forum
[11:26:58] <DaveMethvin> whoa, somehow we managed to create a bunch of dups http://bugs.jquery.com/timeline
[11:27:03] <DaveMethvin> i'll delete those
[11:27:25] <Guest50001> it worked, but didn't respond!
[11:27:37] <Guest50001> does that happen often?
[11:27:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i think it may be the spam checker
[11:28:05] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately, spammers are hitting the box several times a minute
[11:28:14] <Guest50001> yikes!
[11:28:30] <Guest50001> I keep the spam down to 0 on the forum.
[11:28:59] <DaveMethvin> there's a spam filter and capcha but the spammers get through that anyway
[11:29:24] <Guest50001> they are spamming manually?
[11:29:43] <DaveMethvin> has to be automated given the frequency, it's 24 hours a day
[11:30:01] <DaveMethvin> one of the problems is that the registration doesn't require a confirm link
[11:30:06] <DaveMethvin> you can make up email addresses
[11:30:21] <DaveMethvin> hell, it doesn't even require an email :/
[11:32:39] <Guest50001> If you have more to add, please comment on http://forum.jquery.com/topic/unable-to-report-a-bug-to-bugs-jquery-com#14737000005296046
[11:32:49] <Guest50001> Thanks Dave!
[11:32:59] <DaveMethvin> Thank you!
[11:33:09] <Guest50001> bye
[17:43:54] <m_gol> paul_irish DaveMethvin: jQuery 2.1.1 and 1.11.1 were released 2 weeks ago, does it take that long to get into the Google CDN?
