[09:23:46] <Barelds> Hello, not sure if this is quite the right place... But I just wrote my first jquery plugin- and since it's my first I probably did a bunch of thigns wrong. Where do I go to share it and/or get feedback?
[09:30:32] <m_gol> Barelds: #jquery, forum.jquery.com or Stack Overflow
[09:31:02] <Barelds> thanks m_gol, currently having a look at the forum
