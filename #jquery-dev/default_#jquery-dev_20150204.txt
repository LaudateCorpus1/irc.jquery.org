[07:36:28] <m_gol> timmywil: how about a label "Waiting for Sizzle update" (or a shorter equivalent name)? We could close all issues with this label when updating Sizzle; otherwise it's sometimes hard to find them
[07:37:48] <timmywil> What if we referenced the jquery issue in the Sizzle commit?
[07:39:32] <timmywil> like Fixes gh-103 \n Ref jquery/jquery#1400
[07:40:00] <timmywil> If we could auto-close, that would be even better.
[07:40:24] <m_gol> timmywil: but we want to have the issue open as long as Sizzle is not updated within jQuery, right?
[07:40:31] <m_gol> so auto-closing from Sizzle would defeat that purpose
[07:40:34] <timmywil> right right, not auto-close
[07:40:58] <m_gol> referencing would be nice but we still need to know which tickets to close after the newest Sizzle intake
[07:41:34] <timmywil> true
[07:42:03] <timmywil> the Sizzle log would list them, but I guess it would be nice to have some way to filter on github
[07:42:16] <timmywil> the Selector tag + milestone is almost that

[07:50:41] <m_gol> timmywil: almost :) it includes plans for the release so it still requires looking at every ticket
[07:50:49] <m_gol> there are not a lot of them so maybe that's not a problem
[07:51:02] <m_gol> obviously a label would be simpler to quickly comprehend
[08:21:35] <timmywil> m_gol: yea, I'll add a label. DaveMethvin still needs to give me admin. ;)
[08:21:53] <m_gol> you don't need to be an admin to add a label
[08:22:16] <m_gol> timmywil: just go to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/labels and you can add whatever you want ;)
[08:22:20] <timmywil> you don't? I don't see the "manage labels" button that was usually there.
[08:22:36] <timmywil> ha, you're right
[08:23:04] <m_gol> it's kinda not intuitive you can't add a label from issues view, I thought I don't have rights for this as well
[08:23:45] <timmywil> github changed stuff around right under my nose!
[08:25:39] <timmywil> done
[09:11:47] <gibson042> timmywil m_gol: do we really want it to be Sizzle-specific? I was thinking something like "Pending upstream" (or even just "Upstream"), to be applied immediately upon identifying an issue as someone else's problem (e.g., QUnit, Sizzle, or even BrowserStack or phantomjs)
[09:12:37] <m_gol> gibson042: maybe, but it happens way more often that we get a bug report, it gets migrated to Sizzle and we put a comment it's fixed but an issue stays open until Sizzle gets upgraded
[09:18:13] <timmywil> yea, I think Sizzle is the main culprit needing a label.
[09:18:52] <timmywil> We can always change it later.
[09:21:21] <m_gol> btw, timmywil gibson042: congrats on your new roles! :)
[09:21:23] <gibson042> true, but I think some issues _don't_ get created because they're not possible without upstream releases (think QUnit.skip, "test is flaky", change a build/test tool, update package configuration etc.)
[09:21:33] <gibson042> thanks :)

[10:44:23] <timmywil> gibson042: In that case, seems like we could make a "Awaiting QUnit Update" label too. I think specificity would be helpful.
[10:45:06] <timmywil> If it turns out to be common enough
[10:45:10] <gibson042> ok; Sizzle for now and others as-needed
