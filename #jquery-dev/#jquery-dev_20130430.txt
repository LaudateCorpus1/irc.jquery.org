[06:51:07] <JamesMGreene> Hey question
[06:51:24] <JamesMGreene> With regard to signing the CLA, are fake mailing addresses acceptable?
[06:51:55] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin rworth ajpiano et al: With regard to signing the CLA, are fake mailing addresses acceptable?
[06:52:21] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene they should not be fake
[06:52:34] <DaveMethvin> i haven't been verifying them though
[06:52:48] <DaveMethvin> but if they are clearly fake that's a differnet thing
[06:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: I already replied to him.
[06:54:46] <JamesMGreene> ok, thanks scott_gonzalez and DaveMethvin
[06:55:03] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: The CLA is a legal document. Fake anything is a serious issue.
[06:55:27] <JamesMGreene> Time to sue that DaveMethvin guy :)
[06:55:51] <JamesMGreene> Now how to mail it to him...?
[07:44:51] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: It comes down to the git author e-mailaddress though. 
[07:45:20] <Krinkle> If it is the same as their GitHub account profile e-mailaadress, it is pretty much sure to be real becuase they have to verify it at github
[07:46:04] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: It doesn't need to match.
[07:46:16] <scott_gonzalez> What needs to match is what's in the commit and what's in the CLA.
[07:47:05] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: I know It doesn't have to match github account, I mean, the CLA needs to match the addres of the commit (obviously)
[07:47:12] <Krinkle> the easiest way to verify that that address is real is through github
[07:47:40] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: does our online CLA form validate the e-mailaddress?
[07:47:55] <Krinkle> I'd hope so, else it is trivial to fake it.
[07:48:07] <DaveMethvin> how would we validate it?
[07:48:32] <DaveMethvin> it just records what the user typed, so no validate
[07:48:35] <Krinkle> add to database with confirmed=0 column and token, email contains link with token, click link, token confirmed, confirmed=1
[07:48:41] <Krinkle> trivial to do in any web app.
[07:48:53] <DaveMethvin> it's not a web app, it's a google spreadsheet
[07:49:14] <DaveMethvin> or properly a google form in front of a google spreadsheet
[07:50:03] <Krinkle> I know what it is now :-). Unless Google has a built-in thing for e-mail confirmation, this means this is not scalable and feasible way to keep track of CLA for the future.
[07:50:23] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Why?
[07:50:28] <DaveMethvin> we can certainly put a master CLA manager on the list of things to do
[07:50:39] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Because it just takes arbitrary input and adds it to the spreadsheet?
[07:50:39] <DaveMethvin> right now i'd really like to be able to have our unit tests run tho
[07:50:40] <scott_gonzalez> Are you concerned that people will commit perjury in order to try to sue us?
[07:52:21] <Krinkle> No
[07:53:11] <Krinkle> Aside from it being a tough one to make solid in a lawsuit (web forms with no attempt at validation/verification from the intaking party don't seem very solid)
[07:53:18] <Krinkle> It would also be open to spam I suppose.
[07:53:42] <Krinkle> Though it is an iframed form managed by google, so they keep that on the radar for us
[07:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> web forms with no attempt at validation/verification from the intaking party don't seem very solid -> About as solid as conventional paper documents...
[07:54:36] <Krinkle> I think we'd do ourselves a favour if we at least try to verify 1 bit of the data that matters most to us (emailaddress). And having our own database would also make it easier to look through and re-use data from.
[07:54:59] <DaveMethvin> how often do we need to use that email? is it worth our collective time to validate?
[07:55:06] <DaveMethvin> probably not
[07:55:10] <Krinkle> it isn't costing us any time.
[07:55:17] <Krinkle> You wouldn't do it manually, of course.
[07:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: So go ahead and build the system.
[07:55:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah honestly i'm not opposed to someone building the system
[07:55:44] <Krinkle> We confirm addresses everywhere. Sign up somewhere and guruanteed you get an email with a link. Even when signing up for news letters.
[07:55:57] <DaveMethvin> but i do think we have more important priorites as a project
[07:56:14] <DaveMethvin> like having our jenkins/swarm setup run right
[07:56:20] <Krinkle> sure :)
[07:56:33] <DaveMethvin> that's what it comes down to, priorities
[07:56:38] <Krinkle> I wouldn't be surprised if there was some (unenforceable outdated non-tech) law against this even.
[07:57:00] <DaveMethvin> law against what?
[07:57:02] <Krinkle> Like how some believe newsletters are required to verify addresses and include an unsubscribe link.
[07:57:16] <DaveMethvin> we're not sending these people anything
[07:57:20] <Krinkle> I know
[07:57:26] <Krinkle> It was a comparison
[07:57:31] <Krinkle> Anyhow, nevermidn.
[07:57:37] <DaveMethvin> okay, well let's worry about the real things and not the theoretical ones

[10:05:55] <Krinkle> brb later
[10:06:09] <Krinkle> It's Queen's day. The whole center of towns is going nuts
[11:10:41] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle jzaefferer: Can either of you explain this bit from the grunt-contrib-qunit bridge.js file?
[11:11:01] <JamesMGreene> `// Run tests serially, not in parallel.
[11:11:10] <JamesMGreene> QUnit.config.autorun = false;
[11:13:22] <Krinkle> I can
[11:13:42] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: There is two of them, right?
[11:14:01] <Krinkle> https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-qunit/blob/master/phantomjs/bridge.js#L13-L16
[11:14:26] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: autorun makes it start at dom-ready
[11:14:39] <Krinkle> otherwise, you need to call .start() to let the first test start
[11:14:55] <JamesMGreene> I thought that was `autostart`
[11:14:56] <Krinkle> i.e. without autorun=true (default) it will start is a stopped state
[11:15:04] <Krinkle> Right
[11:16:11] <JamesMGreene> ...?
[11:16:57] <JamesMGreene> I mean, I tried to look at the QUnit core code but there aren't any comments or obvious context, so it didn't really help
[11:17:25] <JamesMGreene> `autorun` is used during the `synchronize` and always set to `true` in the `done` callback (moduleDone)
[11:17:26] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: memorised ‚Äúautorun`‚Äù.

[11:23:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah, like one isn't enough trouble
[11:23:58] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Perhaps use Blame to figure out why/when it was added (both in qunit and in the grunt plugin)
[11:24:03] <Krinkle> I'm not sure why
[11:26:23] <JamesMGreene> Annoying that ` triggers the bot's memory instead of requiring something like ?memo
[11:26:55] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene i think it's the "is"
