[00:53:48] <gnarf> sigh
[00:54:18] <jaubourg> .
[00:56:46] <gnarf> jaubourg: hey
[00:58:06] <gnarf> jaubourg: I assume you want testswarm to test the serialize module too?

[00:59:38] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Push serialize module to swarm /cc @jaubourg - Corey Frang

[01:20:42] <i-hate-dave> j: Extracts the serialization code from the ajax module so that alternative ajax implementations can use it without the need for the whole ajax module to be included in the build.
[01:24:11] <gnarf> jaubourg: now in next swarm: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/254 ;)
[01:45:17] <jaubourg> damnit, completely forgot about that
[01:45:20] <jaubourg> thanks gnarf
[01:46:05] <gnarf> jaubourg: np
[01:46:29] <gnarf> jaubourg: it was a joy to work on something so easy after spending most of my day writing a multipart/form-data processor for Classic ASP in JScript mode
[01:46:39] <jaubourg> oh my
[01:46:54] <gnarf> jaubourg: which actually led me to a question... do you know of a multipart/form-data plugin for ajax? :)
[01:47:42] <jaubourg> whenever multipart is involved, all I see are people using iframes and upload forms
[01:47:59] <gnarf> fair nuff
[01:48:25] <gnarf> I need to try to figure out how to get a base64 string up to the server now
[01:48:37] <jaubourg> I need to dig into the xhr2 spec to see how we could offer something in ajax as painless as possible
[01:48:37] * gnarf shrugs
[01:48:40] <gnarf> figure it out tomorrow
[01:48:48] <jaubourg> why on earth would you work on ASP?
[01:48:51] <jaubourg> just curious
[01:49:27] <gnarf> because I haven't won the fight to use something not windows yet?  and given a choice between C#.NET or JScript asp...
[01:49:46] * gnarf shrugs, its usually not that bad actually
[01:50:00] <gnarf> just kinda stab around in the dark debug method
[01:50:07] <jaubourg> yeah, I hear you
[01:50:45] <gnarf> then i spent like 3 hours trying to get a trac clone setup on jq05.stage.jquery.com:3050
[01:50:55] <gnarf> and I'm really really annoyed with that one too
[01:51:19] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Core build #256: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/256/
[01:51:19] <i-hate-dave> Corey Frang: Push serialize module to swarm /cc @jaubourg
[01:51:38] <jaubourg> just some offset failure in IE8
[01:51:48] <jaubourg> cool, I didn't break ajax :)
[05:50:55] <gibson042> .
[06:33:17] <gibson042> does anyone else see 404 when ey try to submit a PR against sizzle? https://github.com/<github username>/sizzle/pull/new
[06:51:01] <DaveMethvin> .
[06:51:27] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: github has been flakey for me lately on both pushes and pulls, sometimes i get errors and then when i retry it works
[06:51:38] <DaveMethvin> is it consistently 404?
[06:55:10] <gibson042> yeah
[06:56:15] <DarsVaeda> is there some bug with attr('id')? I get the element back not the string of the id while prop always works as expected of attr in those cases
[06:56:22] <DarsVaeda> and 'id' is not a prop, or?
[06:58:31] <DarsVaeda> ahh nevermind I just found a bug ticket about this
[07:01:03] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: I just tried it again with the same results
[07:01:22] <gibson042> but I *can* open a PR against jquery
[07:01:54] <DaveMethvin> so are you opening the pr via the github pages?
[07:02:49] <gibson042> yes
[07:03:35] <gibson042> what are the alternatives?
[07:04:05] <DaveMethvin> good question... you could create a diff and email it? I've done patches that way before
[07:04:19] <jaubourg> PR broke?
[07:04:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:04:29] <jaubourg> hi gibson042, DaveMethvin
[07:04:35] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg
[07:04:40] <gibson042> oh hai
[07:04:44] <jaubourg> other alternative, Dave, give gibson042 commit priv
[07:04:45] * jaubourg hides
[07:05:19] <DaveMethvin> has to cause less damage than me :D
[07:05:24] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: It's hard to keep your servers up when you have $100 million :-P
[07:05:30] <gibson042> lol
[07:05:52] <jaubourg> hey scott_gonzalez
[07:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> hey jaubourg
[07:06:08] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: to where would I email?
[07:06:17] <jaubourg> gibson042: is it only sizzle?
[07:06:20] <gibson042> n/m; this work is a pair of patches
[07:06:23] <jaubourg> I mean the PR brokage
[07:06:32] <gibson042> one sizzle; one jquery
[07:06:46] <jaubourg> k
[07:07:19] <DaveMethvin> gibson042:  is there a ticket? you could put the diffs there if they aren't too big
[07:07:27] <DaveMethvin> that would give us an audit trail
[07:07:31] <jaubourg> +1
[07:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: gist-diff :-)
[07:08:07] <jaubourg> OR you could wait for github to fix the issue... unless they're unaware of it which I doubt
[07:08:26] <DaveMethvin> i would think this is temporary, the github guys are probably just cackling loudly as they roll naked in their money
[07:09:06] <gibson042> ok; I think I'll wait a bit and fallback on a diff post if it isn't fixed by Monday
[07:09:14] <gibson042> it's not urgent
[07:09:21] <jaubourg> oh, I thought they'd be rolling in tons of coke but maybe they couldn't contact the dealer yet
[07:09:41] <jaubourg> too.much.TV
[07:10:59] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: was todd going to put his budget numbers in your sheet?
[07:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Did the priority sheet make sense to you?
[07:12:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:12:36] <DaveMethvin> i didn't see todd's numbers
[07:13:05] <scott_gonzalez> Lines 13-17
[07:13:12] <scott_gonzalez> He's still gathering info to fill it in though.
[07:13:29] <DaveMethvin> ok
[07:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'm surprised that core is getting so many tickets about UI, but UI isn't getting any.
[07:22:07] <jaubourg> Most people stop at jQuery and forget about the UI part I guess
[07:22:42] <jaubourg> also, maybe testing 1.8b2 and seeing it fail with UI makes them assume it's a core problem, not UI
[07:23:10] <jaubourg> dunno if I make sense here btw
[07:33:47] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: is the serialize.js module ok with you? I didn't put the parseXXX methods there... not sure they belong here
[07:34:27] <DaveMethvin> depends on the use cases jaubourg ... seems like that would be fine if i just wanted jsonp.js right?
[07:34:32] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: there's the jQuery.ajaxSettings && jQuery.ajaxSettings.traditional bit that is "dodgy"
[07:34:32] <DaveMethvin> oh but JSON
[07:34:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah i thougth of that one
[07:34:52] <DaveMethvin> gah, maybe we should have deprecated that
[07:35:02] <DaveMethvin> i really dislike the global settings
[07:35:08] <jaubourg> yeah, so do I
[07:35:18] <jaubourg> especially given it should be handled inside ajax anyway
[07:35:54] <DaveMethvin> hmm, i'll give it some thought
[07:35:54] <jaubourg> I thought about putting parseJSON and parseXML... but they seem to go well with parseHTML which is NOT for ajax at all
[07:36:17] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin, unrelated but I want to mention before I forget: I'd really like to implement the handler object feature (or take a crack at it anyway) ping me when you're free
[07:36:20] <jaubourg> I dunno, I thought extracting only the serialize code would be nice
[07:36:49] <rwaldron> also, good morning/afternoon DaveMethvin and jaubourg (respectively)
[07:37:04] <jaubourg> hey rwaldron: what is the handler object? :)
[07:37:15] * jaubourg is always too curious
[07:37:16] <DaveMethvin> that was a proposal in a feature ticket a few days ago
[07:37:28] <DaveMethvin> lemme get the ticket
[07:37:31] <rwaldron> jaubourg http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12031
[07:37:32] <jaubourg> I didn't see it pass, week has been crazy crazy crazy
[07:37:39] <jaubourg> I'm under on tickets and PRs
[07:37:57] <DaveMethvin> it's not quite as easy as the guy makes out, but the concept is nice
[07:38:08] <rwaldron> it will add functionality that the DOM addEventListener has but we dont
[07:38:11] <jaubourg> yeah, nice
[07:38:11] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin oh, i know
[07:38:14] <DaveMethvin> and I think it can be ovreloaded on the current .on() signatures without too muc disruption
[07:38:20] <rwaldron> that's why I want to take a crack at it
[07:38:52] <rwaldron> But I wanted to clear that with you, since you're basically the Emporer of Events
[07:39:02] <rwaldron> I think it's a rad idea
[07:39:06] <DaveMethvin> in his example he has his own handleEvent shim, it seems like we could do that if there wasn't one already
[07:39:10] <jaubourg> could be very handy actually
[07:39:11] <DaveMethvin> but sure rwaldron go for it
[07:39:16] <rwaldron> yes
[07:39:34] <rwaldron> I was thinking that we could define one if not there
[07:39:36] <DaveMethvin> so if there was a method named click on the object and no handleEvent shim, we'd call click as the handler
[07:39:55] <rwaldron> so like... { click: function() {} } would still work
[07:40:07] <rwaldron> we'd just add a generic handleEvent
[07:40:45] <DaveMethvin> oh, from the current .on({ click: fn }) signature? yeah!
[07:41:06] <jaubourg> :)
[07:41:27] <jaubourg> anyway, I gotta fly, was nice to talk to you guys even briefly... hopefully next week will be more reasonable
[07:41:35] * jaubourg vanishes
[07:41:54] <DaveMethvin> has to handle .on({ click: fn }, "div") delegated events, and .on({ click: fn }, "div", dataobject)  as well, but hmmm maybe it won't be too hard!
[07:42:33] <rwaldron> cool, I'm adding all of this to the ticket to make sure it's covered
[07:44:02] <DaveMethvin> dog walking time
[08:58:01] <gnarf> gibson042: do you mean to be using https and not git@ ?
[09:01:17] <gibson042> I use git@ for pushing local commits and the web UI (https:) for making pull requests
[09:03:10] <gibson042> gnarf: is there a better way?
[09:10:22] <gnarf> nope
[09:10:29] <gnarf> i just realized you meant actually creating a pull
[09:10:32] <gnarf> not pushing to repo
[09:13:16] <DaveMethvin> generally i use git@ but sometimes when i'm at client sites i have to use https because their firewalls don't let it through otherwise
[09:42:44] <gnarf> so i finally threw in my $0.02 on that deferred discussion
[09:55:05] <ryanttb> how can i join the test swarm? I just updated IE9 to 9.0.8 & would like to see if their security fixes to "deleted objects & attributes" breaks anything in jQuery.
[09:56:01] <scott_gonzalez> ryanttb: You can't. We have swarm locked down for trusted browsers.
[09:56:23] <gnarf> ryanttb: you can clone jquery and run the unit tests on your own server tho
[09:57:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We should find a way to get tests to run on the view server :-)
[09:57:31] <scott_gonzalez> It works for UI since we don't require a build.
[09:59:06] <ryanttb> ok, thanks. will see about running my own copy. if I don't get to it, there's a new point release of IE out there :)
[10:00:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hrm
[10:01:05] <gnarf> We could prolly run grunt in each of those folders when it changed
[10:01:12] <gnarf>  /cc clarkbox ^^^
[10:02:11] <gnarf> and just like nginx/.htaccess restrict /dist/*
[10:02:22] <gnarf> to avoid hot-linking to view :)
[10:02:53] <gnarf> although that would totally break units
[10:02:55] <gnarf> :/
[10:07:22] <gnarf> Krinkle: re swarm tagline ideas
[10:07:26] <gnarf> jzaefferer: ^
[10:07:33] <Krinkle> qunit or testswarm tagline?
[10:07:36] <Krinkle> (both I suppose)
[10:07:45] <gnarf> maybe we could somehow come up with like a "write less, do more" kinda thing
[10:07:50] <gnarf> :)
[10:09:03] <gnarf> hard to sum up test swarm in such a catchy tagline tho
[10:11:04] <gnarf> "distributed testing framework" and "distributed unit testing" come to mind as well
[10:11:05] <ryanttb> test it like it's hot
[10:11:44] <gnarf> when the bugs try to hide on you?
[10:12:12] <ryanttb> ...test it like it's hot
[10:13:32] <gnarf> I got the swarm in my pocket, and I'm catchin those bugs.  I got all the browsers tested, cuz I got the test swarm?
[10:17:17] <ryanttb> now all you need is a photoshop of Snoop running test swarm on some blingged out machine
[10:19:52] <ajpiano> TestSwarm: Putting Our HEADs Together
[10:20:01] <ajpiano> :p
[10:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: re: "write less, do more" "wait less, test more"
[10:27:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: +1 :)
[10:28:04] <gnarf> watch less, test more ?
[10:44:59] <Krinkle> worry less, work more?
[10:46:06] <Krinkle> meh, not sure if that paradigm works
[11:43:00] <DaveMethvin> SUCCESS less, STILL FAILING more :P
[11:43:34] <DaveMethvin> WHY DID MY PHP SETUP BREAK?
[11:48:41] <gnarf> btw DaveMethvin
[11:48:49] <gnarf> what are we gonna do about those offset ie8 tests?
[11:48:59] <DaveMethvin> i gotta ping mikesherov
[11:49:05] <DaveMethvin> oh i guess i just did :D
[11:49:14] <DaveMethvin> and find out whether he had a plan
[11:49:20] <DaveMethvin> my plan would be to make the font 14 px
[11:49:54] <gnarf> those seem to be the only consistent failures we see now
[11:50:52] <DaveMethvin> right, and then we have to figure out the random ones
[11:51:01] <DaveMethvin> i noticed you asked Krinkle about the retest process
[11:51:13] <DaveMethvin> that would help too
[11:51:25] <DaveMethvin> a few of them can be fixed with longer timeouts
[11:51:33] <DaveMethvin> but that one error issue with opera is bizarre
[11:51:43] <gnarf> agree
[12:23:23] <gnarf> clarkbox jzaefferer Krinkle: ping me - we need to move swarm like ASAP
[12:26:02] <gnarf> It is on hardware that has been EOL at (mt) for way too long, and they are literally going to turn it off on us.  We MUST get this new environment working like yesterday, and I would appreciate a little help making sure its stable and set up properly
[12:33:10] <Krinkle> I'm currently at a conference in DC
[12:33:15] <Krinkle> I've got about 1-2 hours time right now
[12:33:21] <Krinkle> gnarf:
[12:33:57] <Krinkle> gnarf: Get me access and I'll see what I can do. I'll need you guidance probably to make sure stuff goes in the right places
[12:37:55] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Core build #257: STILL FAILING in 25 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/257/
[12:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I see John at 1:22 in this video: http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/13.0.1/firstrun/
[12:49:07] <gnarf> Krinkle: see pm
[12:49:19] <gnarf> sorry i had to walk to the store fast
[12:49:30] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ^^^ STILL FAILING
[12:51:16] <DaveMethvin> gnarf REVERT, REVERT!!!1
[12:51:22] <DaveMethvin> oh did you change the font size?
[12:51:31] <DaveMethvin> now it's failing in opera
[12:55:14] <gnarf> no, but i-hate-dave really hates you
[13:10:58] <scott_gonzalez> Why does this page not trigger the native autocomplete for me? http://jsbin.com/obuwoc/2
[13:14:13] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: it does for  me, in chrome, after i hit submit
[13:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[13:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't for me in Chrome.
[13:18:08] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well, it's working for me in Safari.
[13:20:27] <DaveMethvin> damn, 50% success rate, better than we do on unit tests
[13:28:35] <mikesherov> HI
[13:28:36] <bot-t> (31 hours 6 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell mikesherov I wasn't suggesting to keep a ticket open. I was wondering if we should choose one as the "master" ticket and close the others as duplicates of it.
[13:28:50] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: roger
[13:29:07] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here
[13:29:10] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, that message is old.
[13:29:33] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: yep
[13:29:39] <DaveMethvin> busy lately, eh?
[13:31:21] <mikesherov> yes
[13:31:24] <mikesherov> very
[13:31:28] <mikesherov> sorry about that
[13:31:47] <DaveMethvin> that does it, no paycheck for you :P
[13:31:51] <mikesherov> you pinged me before?
[13:32:04] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, just wondering what the fix would be for the unit tests
[13:32:15] <mikesherov> Oh, also, I keep irc open all day now where as before I used to only go into IRC when I was there
[13:32:21] <mikesherov> literally anything
[13:32:23] <DaveMethvin> you said it was in the bootstrap css?
[13:32:31] <mikesherov> change it to font-size:11px; would work
[13:32:36] <DaveMethvin> which file?
[13:32:39] <mikesherov> well, in bootstrap.min.css
[13:32:50] <mikesherov> and by that token, bootstrap.css
[13:32:59] <DaveMethvin> why the heck is someone using px for font sizes anyway?
[13:34:34] <DaveMethvin> okay, so this line: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/css/bootstrap.css#L161
[13:34:48] <Krinkle> Yes?
[13:35:01] <Krinkle> oh, that wasn't a ping for me
[13:35:03] <Krinkle> weird
[13:35:47] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: mikesherov: Why would css in the run page affect the test run?
[13:35:59] <mikesherov> Krinkle: I DONT KNOW!
[13:36:02] <Krinkle> Reset it inside the test run if needed. QUnit does that, right?
[13:36:15] <mikesherov> No, it's the OUTER FRAME
[13:36:18] <mikesherov> It's crazy
[13:36:25] <mikesherov> it's the craziest IE8 bug ever
[13:36:28] <gnarf> three cheers for IE8
[13:36:31] <Krinkle> Does QUnit reset the font-size in the inner frame?
[13:36:37] <mikesherov> I tried that
[13:36:46] <DaveMethvin> it's like the font size soaks into the inner frame and leaves a slight but noticeable stain
[13:37:02] <mikesherov> it didn't fix it
[13:37:07] <Krinkle> what is the assertion?
[13:37:21] <DaveMethvin> the one that fails  you mean?
[13:37:22] <mikesherov> body {font-size:12px;}
[13:38:00] <mikesherov> What must be happening is a variant of this: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8625
[13:38:16] <Krinkle> Yes
[13:38:20] <Krinkle> That is in IE9
[13:38:25] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/52770, right ?
[13:38:28] <DaveMethvin> you mean it could spread?
[13:38:35] <mikesherov> Krinkle: yes, it is
[13:38:41] <mikesherov> I'm saying it must be some weird variant of that
[13:38:53] <mikesherov> in that there are bugs that exists when an outer frame munges the inner frame
[13:38:59] <mikesherov> I'm not sure of the root cause
[13:39:06] <mikesherov> but you can verify it yourself if you like
[13:41:13] <Krinkle> gnarf: My time is about up, I'll be available tomorrow again. To allow for asynchronisity, please get me whatever details I might need so I can work on it. Basically I need to know:
[13:41:16] <Krinkle> * What server to ssh into
[13:41:23] <Krinkle> * What hostname I can preview what I'm doing
[13:41:29] <Krinkle> * Where on that server I should put my stuff
[13:41:31] <gnarf> Krinkle: all in your pm
[13:41:45] <Krinkle> * If and where I should document it (I'm bad at puppet, but could try)
[13:41:48] <Krinkle> that's it
[13:42:01] <Krinkle> ok
[13:48:29] <gnarf> mikesherov: just to be clear, we are discussing an IE8 bug that is a weird variant of a yet unreduced IE9 bug
[13:48:44] <gnarf> this is like some advanced chess strategy
[13:49:00] <gnarf> also - i still can't manage to write a unit test that actually catches that one bug
[13:50:08] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9217
[13:50:52] <gnarf> there is a test case that breaks for me
[13:51:03] <gnarf> in jsfiddle
[13:51:07] <gnarf> but not in qunit
[13:51:11] <gnarf> also seems ie8 related
[13:51:32] <DaveMethvin> so gnarf, you're saying we just wait til 2.0 and it's fixed? :D
[13:51:35] <DaveMethvin> done
[13:52:09] <gnarf> well, I can just try{ } catch(e) {}; the error away
[13:52:13] <DaveMethvin> this is probably the same iframe-related madness maybe?
[13:52:15] <gnarf> the fix is done...
[13:52:18] <DaveMethvin> ugh
