[11:26:27] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[16:31:20] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin not sure if i missed you while I was away...
[16:34:39] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: don't think i had anything urgent ... if so I can't remember :)
[16:34:58] <rwaldron> Oh, I meant in reply to me
[16:35:02] <rwaldron> I had asked if you were there
[16:35:04] <rwaldron> and then had to go
[16:35:32] <rwaldron> annnyway
[16:35:58] <rwaldron> was wondering if you're ready or interested in review stuff for your event-on-method branch
[16:36:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was thinking about how i wanted to proceed on that
[16:36:29] <DaveMethvin> i have  a bunch of bugs to fix
[16:36:42] <DaveMethvin> and was thinking i might want to apply them to the branch
[16:36:50] <DaveMethvin> after finding out if they are still there
[16:36:56] <rwaldron> i didnt want to start line commenting if you werent ready
[16:37:10] <DaveMethvin> well i know there is a bunch of cosmetic stuff broken
[16:37:18] <rwaldron> not too bad
[16:37:18] <DaveMethvin> and things like nested functions
[16:37:26] <DaveMethvin> so i needed to fix those
[16:37:29] <rwaldron> at least as far as the test suite goes
[16:37:41] <rwaldron> live with context and delegate with context are busted
[16:37:51] <rwaldron> but i figure that's wired to the same logic
[16:37:58] <DaveMethvin> i think i have some commits that fix that
[16:38:11] <DaveMethvin> just not pushed
[16:38:20] <rwaldron> i'm not even all the way through reading event.js
[16:38:34] <DaveMethvin> i am most concerned about the interface changes
[16:38:43] <DaveMethvin> like, i have removed the "live" event
[16:38:47] <rwaldron> i pulled yours and pushed to my fork, so i can also just line comment there
[16:39:01] <rwaldron> ad you can peek for notes
[16:39:07] <DaveMethvin> that works for me
[16:39:19] <DaveMethvin> that would be great!
[16:39:35] <rwaldron> so far, just style nits
[16:39:43] <rwaldron> but i only sat down with it about 20 mins ago
[16:39:56] <DaveMethvin> i still have a bunch of todos, there aren't any unit tests for .on() but since the old apis are implemented in terms of it
[16:40:03] <DaveMethvin> it is pretty well tested
[16:40:13] <rwaldron> i i figured
[16:40:15] <DaveMethvin> just need to explicitly call it and make sure arg passing works
[16:40:16] <rwaldron> -i
[16:40:21] <rwaldron> right
[16:40:31] <DaveMethvin> there is one ugly thing
[16:40:45] <rwaldron> that is...
[16:40:49] <DaveMethvin> .on(events, selector, data, fn)
[16:41:00] <DaveMethvin> if you specify data as a plain string
[16:41:07] <DaveMethvin> i can't tell it from a selector
[16:41:14] <rwaldron> oh man
[16:41:18] <DaveMethvin> so i think it's a delegated bind
[16:41:19] <rwaldron> i have a present for you
[16:41:23] <rwaldron> !!!!
[16:41:37] * rwaldron is too excited for words
[16:41:40] <DaveMethvin> is it shiny?
[16:41:51] <DaveMethvin> does it smelll like fresh daisies?
[16:42:15] <DaveMethvin> can it remove scratches from stainless steel?
[16:42:26] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/v5J6f/
[16:42:27] <DaveMethvin> don't keep me in suspense!
[16:42:36] <rwaldron> no, but it will tell you if something is a selector or not
[16:42:38] <rwaldron> :D
[16:42:47] <rwaldron> as in, a valid selector
[16:42:56] <rwaldron> in _every_ browser we support
[16:43:09] <rwaldron> so, it would work for you
[16:43:23] <rwaldron> unless the string data param was like... "div#foo"
[16:43:29] <rwaldron> in which case... bummer
[16:43:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah, the data string could be "div" or something
[16:44:02] <DaveMethvin> technically the docs say the data should be an OBJECT
[16:44:07] <rwaldron> this is true
[16:44:17] <DaveMethvin> but our own unit tests were passing a plain number
[16:44:23] <rwaldron> we can easily point to that and say "use a damn object"
[16:44:30] <rwaldron> well, i think i added those
[16:44:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah just like trigger :/
[16:44:39] <DaveMethvin> no that was for trigger
[16:44:46] <DaveMethvin> and i agree it was pretty common
[16:44:52] <DaveMethvin> this is for binding
[16:44:56] <rwaldron> gotcha
[16:45:00] <rwaldron> right... yes
[16:45:15] <rwaldron> i added the tests and support for non-bject stuff passing through trigger
[16:45:23] <rwaldron> sorry!
[16:45:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah and I  pass those nyeah neyha
[16:45:53] <rwaldron> you've likely already tried this...
[16:46:16] <rwaldron> can you couple your checks with arguments.length tests?
[16:46:27] <DaveMethvin> you can do .on(events, null, "datastring", fn)
[16:46:36] <DaveMethvin> well you can look at the code
[16:46:43] <DaveMethvin> it's already doing a bunch of parameter hockey
[16:46:47] <rwaldron> ugh
[16:46:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[16:46:52] <rwaldron> i dont think i got that far
[16:46:58] <rwaldron> and i've been talking to you
[16:47:02] <rwaldron> let me jump to that
[16:47:08] <DaveMethvin> near the bottom
[16:47:22] <DaveMethvin> i have a bunch of the old code commented out just to refer back to it
[16:47:26] <rwaldron> hahaha
[16:47:37] <rwaldron> holy shit, you did ditch live/die
[16:47:46] <DaveMethvin> take NO prisoners
[16:47:57] <rwaldron> i really was reading the blame line by line
[16:48:00] <rwaldron> so i hadnt seen that
[16:48:23] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking about re-applying the changes to get the diffs down
[16:48:39] <DaveMethvin> i refactored things about three times and in the process made a bunch of spurious changes and reorgs
[16:48:47] <DaveMethvin> the main changes are this:
[16:49:04] <rwaldron> i do that
[16:49:10] <DaveMethvin> 1) jQuery.event.add and .remove now pass a selector
[16:49:14] <rwaldron> then i hate myself for doing that
[16:49:22] <DaveMethvin> to indicate delegated events
[16:49:27] <rwaldron> right
[16:49:37] <DaveMethvin> 2) the handle method now handles delegated events directly
[16:50:05] <DaveMethvin> 3) the old jQuery.fn.bind/live/delegate are implemented in terms of .on()
[16:50:14] <DaveMethvin> and that's all the big changes
[16:50:41] <rwaldron> Hm.
[16:50:54] <rwaldron> I'm poking through on: function() {}
[16:51:08] <rwaldron> there is stuff you ported from previous code, but the comments are gone
[16:51:27] <rwaldron> i cant actually point to anything specific
[16:51:44] <rwaldron> but i'm pretty sure i commented the fn = false but != null stuff
[16:52:11] <DaveMethvin> oh that was in jQuery.event.add but I moved it here
[16:52:21] <rwaldron> right, it was
[16:52:51] <rwaldron> ooo i think i might be able to save you some bytes
[16:52:58] <rwaldron> https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/blame/event-on-method/src/event.js
[16:53:08] <rwaldron> line 936
[16:53:25] <rwaldron> here you're doing the fn == null test
[16:53:47] <rwaldron> but then another one, but with a different approach on line 950
[16:54:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah the parameter  hockey
[16:54:31] <rwaldron> nevermind
[16:54:38] <rwaldron> i think you need to keep it the way you've got it
[16:55:11] <DaveMethvin> i'll know once i have the unit tests :)
[16:55:15] <rwaldron> because actually, no.. because you're potentially changing fn to something else in the first else/if
[16:55:20] <DaveMethvin> right
[16:55:26] <rwaldron> yeesh
[16:56:04] <DaveMethvin> i tried using args.length but checking for null turned out to be easier
[16:56:20] <DaveMethvin> i also want to allow ppl to pass null/undefined as a placeholder
[16:56:27] <rwaldron> line 955, var origFn should be at the top of the function body
[16:56:42] <rwaldron> shame shame declaring vars in if/else blocks :P
[16:56:44] <DaveMethvin> all the var stuff i was going to go through and do at once
[16:56:50] <rwaldron> ok, cool
[16:56:57] <rwaldron> then i'll zip about that
[16:57:24] <DaveMethvin> my main concern is what people depend on externally
[16:57:32] <DaveMethvin> as far as jQuery.event.add/remove goes
[16:57:37] <DaveMethvin> or depending on "live" events
[16:57:49] <rwaldron> right
[16:57:53] <DaveMethvin> that's not in the documented api but like that will stop anyone
[16:58:09] <rwaldron> but wait, here is live and die in the same jQuery.fn.extend
[16:58:41] <rwaldron> apparently new revised
[16:58:51] <rwaldron> i hope anyway
[16:58:52] <DaveMethvin> implemented in terms of .on()
[16:58:57] <rwaldron> got it
[16:58:59] <DaveMethvin> the other stuff is all the commented out code
[16:59:25] <rwaldron> /TODO: unit test for this crap
[16:59:30] <rwaldron> hehhehehe
[16:59:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[16:59:50] <DaveMethvin> i have a bunch of //TODO in there as reminders
[17:00:20] <rwaldron> i saw, good stuff
[17:00:24] <rwaldron> i liked that one though...
[17:00:39] <rwaldron> i like this secret "**" thing
[17:01:21] <rwaldron> its surprisingly simple
[17:01:22] <DaveMethvin> damn the secret is out
[17:01:37] <DaveMethvin> sorry rwaldron now i  have to shoot you
[17:01:42] * rwaldron ducks
[17:02:02] <DaveMethvin> the delegated event code got SOOOO much simpler
[17:02:27] <DaveMethvin> now it uses the private dispatch() to run both types of  handlers, got rid of a lot of duplication
[17:02:42] <rwaldron> it was definitely a convoluted rat's nest
[17:02:59] <rwaldron> and doesnt appear that way now
[17:03:14] <rwaldron> in fact, this is getting close to being line-by-line readable
[17:03:41] <rwaldron> do we have a deadline for 1.7 features?
[17:03:51] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to bring that up in the monday mtg
[17:04:07] <rwaldron> I might miss said meeting
[17:04:22] <rwaldron> i have an appointment at an auto dealership tomorrow AM
[17:04:31] <DaveMethvin> getting a new car?
[17:04:37] <rwaldron> hopefully
[17:04:49] <DaveMethvin> what kind?
[17:04:52] <rwaldron> i still ahve some college loan woes that I'm ironing out
[17:05:07] <rwaldron> i defaulted on a loan about 8 years ago
[17:05:13] <rwaldron> and ignored it for a few years
[17:05:17] <rwaldron> but now i'm paying
[17:05:26] <rwaldron> but my credit sucks
[17:05:30] <rwaldron> :\
[17:05:35] <rwaldron> we'll see what happens
[17:05:42] <rwaldron> otherwise, not sure what kind
[17:05:46] <rwaldron> i'm not picky
[17:05:54] <DaveMethvin> get a fiat 500
[17:05:57] <rwaldron> i'd like to be picky
[17:06:08] <rwaldron> i've seen a few around boston
[17:06:23] <DaveMethvin> they're pretty cheap, under $20k
[17:06:30] <rwaldron> hm
[17:06:36] <rwaldron> i'll keep that in mind
[17:06:41] <DaveMethvin> all the other cheap cars are hard to find with the tsunami
[17:06:47] <rwaldron> these are kind neat http://www.fiatusa.com/en/
[17:06:57] <DaveMethvin> i wanted a manual and they just don't have any in stock
[17:07:18] <DaveMethvin> real men don't let the car shift gears for them
[17:07:19] <rwaldron> i have a problem with driving manual
[17:07:36] <rwaldron> my dog likes to sit in the passenger seat and poke me with her nose while i'm trying to shift
[17:07:43] <rwaldron> "pet me"
[17:07:48] <rwaldron> "no, i'm driving"
[17:08:09] <DaveMethvin> my dog just sits quietly in the back seat, thank goodness
[17:09:19] <rwaldron> most of the time she does
[17:09:48] <rwaldron> taco, the french bulldog puppy likes to climb up and just stare at me
[17:09:51] <rwaldron> like a creep
[17:10:05] <rwaldron> i've been driving my bestfriend's audi for about 2 months
[17:10:20] <DaveMethvin> even used cars are crazy expensive nowadays
[17:10:33] <DaveMethvin> was looking for something for my daughter to use at college
[17:10:56] <rwaldron> aw man
[17:10:59] <DaveMethvin> anything under 150k miles is more than $5000
[17:10:59] <rwaldron> dont tell me that
[17:11:10] <rwaldron> oh, thats not too bad
[17:11:21] <rwaldron> basically what I was expecting
[17:11:35] <rwaldron> my last used car was a 1999 pathfinder with 75k, 8000
[17:11:42] <DaveMethvin> but then you generally have to pay a stranger in cash
[17:11:48] <rwaldron> they failed to inform me that it had been in 3 accidents
[17:11:54] <DaveMethvin> have you been looking on craigslist?
[17:12:05] <rwaldron> no
[17:12:22] <rwaldron> i'm not looking to buy anything outright if i can help it
[17:12:48] <DaveMethvin> if you want financing it's almost impossible to buy from anybody but a big dealer
[17:12:53] <DaveMethvin> the banks won't do the loan
[17:13:19] <DaveMethvin> dunno if you've applied through any of the internet loan sites
[17:13:42] <DaveMethvin> like lendingtree.com
[17:15:34] <rwaldron> not sure, but the appointment i have tomorrow, the guy I spoke to says he has an approval for me
[17:15:49] <rwaldron> i faxed some info to the dealership
[17:15:54] <rwaldron> "faxed"
[17:16:09] <rwaldron> i chiselled some words into stone
[17:16:11] <DaveMethvin> tech-nology!
[17:23:12] <DaveMethvin> ok rwaldron after doing a quick run-through i definitely am going to re-apply the changes to minimize the diff noise
[17:23:25] <rwaldron> ok
[17:23:35] <rwaldron> i'll keep my ear to the ground for those
[17:24:09] <DaveMethvin> good luck on the car!
[17:24:14] <rwaldron> thanks!
