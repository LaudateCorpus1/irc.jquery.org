[05:28:55] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Great. Got an ETA for 1.9.0?
[05:35:33] <scott_gonzalez> Awww, Mike Taylor would be so happy http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12711
[06:39:48] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of Boris being a robot, he triaged that ticket at 2:00a.
[06:45:31] * miketaylr wonders how many more plugins will explode due to prefixless CSS https://github.com/rstacruz/jquery.transit/issues/82
[06:49:42] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr: jQuery 1.8 automatically determines prefixes so I'd think it's breaking now; try this on ie9 http://jsfiddle.net/uUbMe/
[06:50:14] <miketaylr> ah right, there was a bug in their tracker for "transit doesn't work in 1.8.2"
[06:50:32] * miketaylr shakes fists at plugins
[06:50:50] <DaveMethvin> "doesn't work"
[06:50:56] <DaveMethvin> the two saddest words
[06:51:06] <miketaylr> heh, yep https://github.com/rstacruz/jquery.transit/pull/81/files
[06:51:21] <miketaylr> dont wokrs plas halp
[06:51:35] <DaveMethvin> zowie, THREE calls to .css()
[06:52:26] <miketaylr> you're right, they could use more
[06:52:45] * DaveMethvin goes to the store to see if they have peanut butter, finds out they do so he comes back, goes to the store to see what brands they have, comes back, goes to the store and buys some
[06:53:00] <DaveMethvin> shopping is hard, let's go coding
[06:54:30] <miketaylr> mmm
[06:56:20] <miketaylr> oh looky, a nicer PR https://github.com/rstacruz/jquery.transit/pull/77/files
[06:56:26] <miketaylr> there's probably 5 more
[06:56:58] <DaveMethvin> all circling the repo, waiting for clearance to land
[06:57:34] <miketaylr> clearly abandoned
[07:47:11] <snover> DaveMethvin: i wanna talk to you~
[07:47:28] <DaveMethvin> uh oh....
[07:47:47] <DaveMethvin> look, i don't know how those shoes got glued to the floor
[07:48:54] <DaveMethvin> so don't blame me snover
[07:51:12] <snover> ya ya
[07:51:23] <snover> I’m scheming
[07:51:38] <snover> and wanted to see if I can get your buy-in on some things
[07:51:47] <DaveMethvin> like...?
[07:52:13] <snover> kinda don’t want to implement our own querying engine in dojo 2
[07:52:18] <snover> kinda want to maybe use jquery for that
[07:52:28] <DaveMethvin> sizzle alone?
[07:52:31] <snover> no
[07:52:37] <DaveMethvin> the whole shebang?
[07:52:46] <snover> a majority of the shebang
[07:53:06] <snover> it depends on how closely goals can be aligned etc. which is what I wanted to talk about
[07:53:17] <DaveMethvin> so would this be 1.9 based, or can you throw off the shackles of oldIE and use 2.0?
[07:53:20] <snover> 2.0
[07:53:22] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[07:53:51] <DaveMethvin> if there are parts you know you don't want, perhaps we can exclude them via the modular build
[07:53:55] <snover> we’d want to not have like the xhr stuff
[07:54:08] <DaveMethvin> so yeah, like remove the ajax parts
[07:55:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah we should definitely scheme on that
[07:56:12] <snover> kk, do you have available times for 30–60 minutes on skype sometime? i need to get back to work-work today but I am off Monday (or at the weekend of course)
[07:56:27] <DaveMethvin> next week i'll be at our dev summit
[07:56:41] <DaveMethvin> maybe the weekend?
[07:57:07] <DaveMethvin> or perhaps later tonight, if that works
[07:57:18] <snover> sure
[07:57:34] <snover> I probably won’t collapse into a blob by then :) just send me a ping when you have time
[07:57:41] <DaveMethvin> ok :D
[07:58:18] <DaveMethvin> gotta walk the dog now, bbl
[08:09:54] <scott_gonzalez> snover DaveMethvin: If you guys don't mind, I'd like to lurk on that call.
[08:10:16] <snover> scott_gonzalez: sure!
[08:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> Kristin's leaving for PA this afternoon with the kids, so my schedule should be wide open.
[08:14:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph?days=14 :-)
[08:41:07] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? <a href="#" disabled> works in IE?
[08:42:23] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Thoughts on this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8661
[08:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> Should I close as invalid since it's invalid markup?
[08:43:46] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: just pushed a commit that fixes everything from your review
[08:44:06] <ajpiano> except for the postStatus thing, which i commented that i think we don't need to change
[08:44:15] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Thanks, I'll check in a minute.
[08:44:21] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...is that working?
[08:44:30] <ajpiano> yea http://cl.ly/image/3N1g0h2I0741
[08:44:56] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-wordpress/blob/master/lib/fields.js#L86
[08:45:06] <ajpiano> heyo
[08:45:34] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I'm confused how that's working.
[08:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, haha
[08:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..no, that's not it.
[08:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-wordpress/blob/master/tasks/wordpress/posts.js#L281
[08:46:59] <ajpiano> i'm just gona push a commit changing it to status,
[08:48:10] <ajpiano> done
[08:48:11] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: It's confusing because postStatus should be dropped as an unrecognized field.
[08:48:18] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm curious how this is working.
[08:48:24] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-wordpress/blob/master/lib/fields.js#L34
[08:48:37] <ajpiano> most curious
[08:48:50] <ajpiano> i just wanted to get it up there right cause i have to kickoff NC in 12 minutes and i don't have coffee
[08:48:57] <ajpiano> :p
[08:49:14] <scott_gonzalez> NC?
[08:49:21] <ajpiano> nelson cash
[08:49:24] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[08:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[08:49:41] <ajpiano> so, should be good on the pr front
[08:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, if there's any small stuff left, I'll just make the edits when I merge.
[08:50:35] <ajpiano> danke
[08:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/pull/8/files#L0R90 We should pass false to taskDone(), right?
[08:51:33] <scott_gonzalez> To signify a failure?
[08:52:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing you didn't test the failure case, since this look like it'd throw: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/pull/8/files#L0R58 :-P
[08:52:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'll test that and fix it.
[08:52:37] <scott_gonzalez> The rest looks good.
[08:53:01] <ajpiano> not sure, scott_gonzalez, i just saw https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/master/tasks/build.js#L89-90 and followed it
[08:53:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that looks wrong too :-P
[08:53:28] <ajpiano> hehe
[08:53:41] <ajpiano> i ran all the changes publishing learn and api.jqueryui
[08:53:56] <ajpiano> to make sure nothing bad happened processing the order in places where it wasn't
[08:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/master/docs/api_task.md#thisasync--grunttaskcurrentasync
[08:54:00] <ajpiano> but yeah, double check
[08:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'll update that in the order code and land that, then update the other places.
[08:54:38] <ajpiano> great
[08:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> Grabbing lunch, then I'll get this published.
[08:58:36] <ajpiano> cool
[09:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> Oy
[09:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> drafts don't work so well in grunt-wordpress.
[09:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need to fix that.
[09:17:20] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: grunt-wordpress ?
[09:27:05] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: the thing that does all the work to put the processed content into wordpress
[09:27:16] <ajpiano> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-wordpress
[09:27:44] <ryanneufeld> wow
[09:27:46] <ryanneufeld> okay
[09:28:01] <ryanneufeld> I thought people usually just logged in an edited stuff
[09:28:12] <ryanneufeld> but I assume this allows people to contrib to the docs via PR?
[09:30:05] <ryanneufeld> cool
[09:42:32] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Yeah, all of the new sites have their content managed in GitHub.
[09:42:43] <ryanneufeld> that's kinda cool
[09:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> Then when the repo is tagged, there's a post-receive hook that pulls the code and runs `grunt deploy`
[09:43:04] <ryanneufeld> at first I was like "Whaaa...?" then I was like "Whoa dude that's cool"
[09:43:16] <scott_gonzalez> Which processes the raw content (HTML, markdown, XML, whatever) into a common format (JSON + HTML).
[09:43:19] <ryanneufeld> neatto
[09:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> And then that is synced to WordPress via XML-RPC.
[09:43:33] <ryanneufeld> my question though is, why bother with wp then?
[09:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> It gives us theming, searching, tags, etc.
[09:43:57] <scott_gonzalez> caching
[09:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> We're basically leveraging all of the WordPress infrastructure so that we can just focus on content.
[09:44:26] <ryanneufeld> oh, yeah, *those* things...
[09:44:32] <ryanneufeld> dep
[09:44:39] <ryanneufeld> *derp
[09:44:48] <ryanneufeld> that's pretty nifty
[09:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[09:45:07] <scott_gonzalez> It started off super hacky, but now it's pretty solid.
[09:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> My initial implementation was directly modifying the WordPress database.
[09:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> Not a good idea :-P
[09:47:09] <ajpiano>  haha
[09:47:29] <ajpiano> my initial implementation for everything i've done in the build post nanoc was to dupliate everything scott_gonzalez only 2 months later
[09:48:41] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: I've learned that WP doesn't like it when you muck in it's DB
[09:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:49:02] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: Indeed. There are hooks galore in the code.
[09:50:00] <ajpiano> if all else fails we always had some voodoo sql we would just throw at it
[09:50:20] <ryanneufeld> virgins, sheep, and bone altars
[09:50:42] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Aha, grunt auto-fails a task because fo the grunt.warn() call.
[09:51:09] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: ah, yeah.  i was originally using logger, and then the task kept running, so i used that :p
[09:51:42] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:54:05] <ajpiano> lolololol https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/blob/d1b064c631890dea6ebebd31b6642fd2942cd84a/nanoc2wordpress/nanoc2wordpress.js
[09:54:10] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: ^^
[09:54:43] <ryanneufeld> sql in node?
[09:55:07] <ajpiano> need somewhere to vom ?
[09:55:18] <ryanneufeld> vom?
[09:55:25] <ajpiano> vomit
[09:55:28] <ryanneufeld> oh
[09:55:31] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: when's a good time for you tonight? Maybe 9pm or so?
[09:55:31] <ryanneufeld> I have a bucket
[09:55:42] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: you should see some of the code I've had to work with
[09:55:43] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: sure
[09:55:45] <ryanneufeld> I'm always prepared
[09:55:57] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: looking at http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8661 now
[10:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: published grunt-jquery-content 0.5.4 and I updated learn to use it and to specify the wordpress.order in grunt.js.
[10:00:28] <ajpiano> hrm, i thought i already did the latter
[10:00:52] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/commit/15c6068d0f0c89f5b560afb662ce22d6a586329e
[10:00:53] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Maybe you put it in your config.json?
[10:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, did you already merge to master?
[10:01:24] <scott_gonzalez> I was still looking at de-wintersmith.
[10:01:33] <ajpiano> oh, yeah, i did
[10:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so you'll just need to update package.json in master then :-P
[10:01:52] <ajpiano> cause getting the order stuff working was orthoganal to the dewintersmithification process
[10:02:00] <ajpiano> cool, i'll pull and test
[10:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> And ignore the commit I just pushed to the branch...
[10:02:08] <ajpiano> no prob
[10:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> I still need to fix the draft bug.
[10:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's creating a new post on every deploy for each post in draft status.
[10:02:46] <scott_gonzalez> When I query for all existing posts, it must not be returning drafts.
[10:03:10] <ajpiano> ah, i noticed some posts being generated that it didn't seem had changed
[10:06:36] <ajpiano> that order.yml file right now only supports 1 level deep of chapter nesting, which works fine now for learn
[10:06:53] <ajpiano> but "theoretically" it should probably handle a more arbitrary structure
[10:06:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I noticed it wasn't recursive.
[10:07:03] <scott_gonzalez> We can add that when we need it.
[10:07:06] <ajpiano> which is why i broke it out into its own helper
[10:07:10] <ajpiano> so we can cross the bridge
[10:07:11] <ajpiano> exactly
[10:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Thoughts on the disabled anchor?
[10:12:37] <DaveMethvin> i think something is strange
[10:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> I agree.
[10:12:46] <DaveMethvin> it's firing the mouse events fine
[10:12:57] <scott_gonzalez> For one, the fact that IE disables anchors!
[10:13:48] <DaveMethvin> is it normal for tooltip.open to be called any time any element is hovered?
[10:14:05] <DaveMethvin> i've got a log on open and if i put it at the very top it seems to fire constantly
[10:14:17] <DaveMethvin> then there's that .closest() check that makes it exit
[10:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, because it's a delegated tooltip.
[10:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> People are lazy and want to do $( document ).tooltip();
[10:15:20] <DaveMethvin> also noticed it check for mouseover on entry but mouseleave for exit
[10:15:27] <DaveMethvin> should be okay but just seemed assymetrical
[10:15:34] <DaveMethvin> i guess for the same reasons with delegation?
[10:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> We don't know what elements we care about for open.
[10:15:59] <scott_gonzalez> So we listen to everything (mouseover instead of mouseenter)
[10:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> But once it's open, we know what we care about, so we listen for mouseleave.
[10:16:32] <DaveMethvin> oh god, $(document).tooltip() is using .closest() each time
[10:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: yup
[10:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> We might be able to use .is(), not sure if that would ever cause problems.
[10:19:32] <DaveMethvin> it's just a lot of traversals
[10:20:02] <DaveMethvin> so i don't get why close isn't being called, the event seems to be firing
[10:20:21] <DaveMethvin> and it seems to be firing at the right time
[10:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...let me check. I didn't actually dig in because of the nonstandard behavior.
[10:21:04] <DaveMethvin> the only delegated event we eat in 1.8+ on a disabled element is the click event, all others pass
[10:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I don't see any events on the disabled anchor.
[10:25:02] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i put this in the console $("#a2, #p2").on("mouseover mouseenter mouseout mouseleave", function(e){console.log(e.type+" "+e.target.id)})
[10:25:16] <DaveMethvin> also added some ids to make it easier to see them
[10:25:22] <DaveMethvin> and they are showing up
[10:25:43] <DaveMethvin> oh but p2 isn't
[10:25:50] <DaveMethvin> those shoudl be bubbling
[10:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsfiddle.net/dRk95/
[10:26:15] <scott_gonzalez> Hand-crafted just to make you smile :-)
[10:26:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:26:53] <DaveMethvin> strange
[10:27:06] <scott_gonzalez> IE is actually disabling the anchor
[10:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> It's grayed out, you can't click it, etc.
[10:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> But this is invalid markup.
[10:28:17] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: http://jsfiddle.net/dRk95/1/
[10:28:23] <DaveMethvin> the delegated events do occur
[10:28:26] <DaveMethvin> just not the direct ones
[10:28:37] <DaveMethvin> which is the same behavior as disabled form elements in ie
[10:29:00] <DaveMethvin> i was logging both and seeing one
[10:29:07] <DaveMethvin> but it was the delegated one
[10:29:34] <DaveMethvin> so the problem is that you're using delegated events for the on but direct for the off
[10:29:48] <DaveMethvin> i thought this was an issue with firefox at one point as well
[10:30:03] <DaveMethvin> oh but probably  not with links, where it's invalid
[10:30:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so this problem probably exists for valid markup as well.
[10:30:27] <scott_gonzalez> Like a disabled button.
[10:30:33] <DaveMethvin> let's see
[10:31:22] <DaveMethvin> yep
[10:31:36] <DaveMethvin> http://jsfiddle.net/dRk95/2/
[10:31:52] <DaveMethvin> http://jsfiddle.net/dRk95/2/
[10:31:57] <DaveMethvin> http://jsfiddle.net/dRk95/3/
[10:32:14] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[10:32:15] <DaveMethvin> oh and one more complication
[10:32:41] <DaveMethvin> in pre-1.8 jquery, we swallowed all delegated events on a disabled element
[10:32:51] <DaveMethvin> in 1.8+ we only swallow click
[10:33:03] <DaveMethvin> specifically so things like mouseover can give a tooltip on disabled elements
[10:33:12] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that'll just have to be a limitation then.
[10:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> So this isn't an issue in Chrome or Firefox.
[10:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> Neither one is showing the tooltip for a disabled button.
[10:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> Opera shows it, but also hides it.
[10:36:07] <DaveMethvin> http://jsbin.com/welcome/33780 on chrome
[10:36:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I don't get a tooltip for the disabled button.
[10:36:31] <scott_gonzalez> Do you?
[10:36:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah, the default system one
[10:36:43] <DaveMethvin> chrome one
[10:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah
[10:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> Because they're killing the native events.
[10:37:07] <scott_gonzalez> So we don't do anything, and then the default behavior kicks in
[10:37:20] <DaveMethvin> which isn't horrible, just a bit inconsistent
[10:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there are no events at all, so there's nothing we can do.
[10:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> That's a cantfix.
[10:38:32] <DaveMethvin> i agree
[10:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> Even without delegated tooltips.
[10:38:58] <DaveMethvin> if the delegated events are consistent you could do them all delegated
[10:39:08] <DaveMethvin> the fact that ie9 puts up the tip but never takes it down is not good
[10:39:24] <DaveMethvin> i can live with the chrome behavior
[10:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> We can filter on disabled.
[10:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can just tell users to filter on disabled.
[10:40:12] <DaveMethvin> i know, put a $(document).mousemove() handler on the page and see what's under the cursor every 250 milliseconds ...
[10:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> Which elements get tooltips is controlled by an option.
[10:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[10:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> [title]:not([diabled]) ?
[10:41:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah basically with disabled spelled right :D
[10:42:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if we should just change the default selector to exclude disabled elements or if we should hard-code filtering out disabled.
[10:42:09] <scott_gonzalez> Changing the default seems better to me.
[10:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> brb
[10:42:23] <DaveMethvin> well it will probalby trip up people no matter what
[10:56:03] <ralphholzmann> scott_gonzalez you need some dropbox space?
[10:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> ralphholzmann: Perhaps. It would allow me to actually use dropbox :-P
[10:57:22] <ralphholzmann> cool, send me your referral link and ill add it to the rotation at sendtodropbox.com
[10:57:30] <ralphholzmann> usually takes like 1-3 months to max out
[10:57:44] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:57:58] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, let me check something first.
[10:58:09] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe if I remove the appendTo folder, the jQuery folder will be under the free limit.
[10:59:23] <ryanneufeld> ralphholzmann: can you add mine too?
[11:01:08] <ralphholzmann> scott_gonzalez: ajpiano mentioned you needed space
[11:01:26] <ralphholzmann> I just thought I'd offer to put your referral link up in the rotation
[11:01:33] <ralphholzmann> no need to delete your shuffle your stuff around
[11:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I removed the appendTo folder and now I'm at 1.7 GB of 2.25 GB used
[11:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> I don't user dropbox personally. I only use it for jQuery.
[11:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> But I couldn't actually add file to it because of the appendTo share.
[11:02:44] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: you can get a tonne more space by using their photoimport
[11:02:47] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: just take the free space, you'll be at 32gb in no time :p
[11:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> Which I've never used.
[11:03:02] <ryanneufeld> max is 16GB now isn't it?
