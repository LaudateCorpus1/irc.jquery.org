[17:20:49] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[17:20:59] <DaveMethvin> wazzup m_gol 
[17:21:22] <m_gol> I've noticed most of our repos on GitHub link to http versions of project sites
[17:21:37] <m_gol> in their one-line descriptions
[17:21:43] <m_gol> like "jQuery JavaScript Library http://jquery.com/"
[17:21:51] <m_gol> we should probably change that, it's 2016 ;)
[17:21:54] <DaveMethvin> just habit i guess, rather than https
[17:22:24] <DaveMethvin> but yeah it would be good to change all those links
[17:24:25] <m_gol> should I create a ticket somewhere?
[17:24:30] <m_gol> (and where? :D)
[17:24:51] <m_gol> I think only repo owners can change that
[17:27:28] <DaveMethvin> i should be able to do it, let me check
[17:28:56] <DaveMethvin> yup, fixed!
[17:33:13] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: a few more: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile, https://github.com/jquery/qunit/, https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/
[17:33:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah, getting them now
[17:33:31] <m_gol> also, all the content sites etc. :D
[17:33:57] <DaveMethvin> i'm just running down the repo list
