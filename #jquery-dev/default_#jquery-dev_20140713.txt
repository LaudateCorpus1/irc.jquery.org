[10:40:13] <Zall> I think I've managed to fix this bug: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15160
[10:40:45] <Zall> as it is present in both jQuery 2 and jQuery 1 do I need to raise two separate PRs?
[10:40:58] <Zall> currently I've just fixed it by branching off of master
[10:50:47] <m_gol> Zall: we can cherry-pick the fix later ourselves if it's easy movable between branches. If it requires a little different fix, it's better to submit 2 PRs
[10:56:02] <Zall> thanks m_gol, it should be an easy cherry-pick

[14:28:43] <Zall> I've added some additional information to that PR ^
[14:29:08] <Zall> My first (and hopefully not last) PR to the jQuery project :)
