[08:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell danheberden are we currently using anything like monit or upstart to keep processes running forever on any of our servers?
[08:12:45] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[10:14:42] <ajpiano> "I don't think discussion is needed to this request because this should have been included in AJAX function for better usability."
[10:14:43] <ajpiano> wat
[10:15:21] <rpflo> it means "do this now, no discussion, punk"
[10:15:45] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/645
[10:17:15] <rpflo> haha, I was kidding, but yeah, that's exactly what he means.
[10:17:32] <ajpiano> yeah, what an insane line of reasoning
[10:17:45] <ajpiano> "I think that it should have been there, therefore, including it requires no discussion."
[10:18:21] <rpflo>  /jquery-team clicks "merge pull request"
[10:50:05] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez no, we aren't
[10:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: ok, I'm going to want something like that for the plugins site
[10:53:24] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: sorry, we can't do that - you'll have to log in every day to make sure things are running
[10:53:34] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:53:36] <danheberden> every 6 hours would be better actually
[10:53:37] <danheberden> :D
[11:43:01] <gibson042> .
[11:51:10] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: I think $.ajax() should have templating built in, mind if I paste mustache.js into that file? :P
[11:51:29] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin well...
[11:51:39] <ajpiano> hey btw guys
[11:51:42] <ajpiano> a guy in jquery made this:
[11:51:46] <ajpiano> http://jqfiddle.net
[11:51:53] <ajpiano> it just routes to jsfiddle with jquery 1.7.1 loaded
[11:51:56] <ajpiano> but still ... useful
[11:52:30] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/api/post/jquery/edge/
[11:53:01] <rpflo> so, I was involved really early with jsfiddle (not since) and have nudged the guys to change the default, but there's no chance until they all realize that MooTools is truly dead.
[11:53:17] <rwaldron> I'm not too worried about it
[11:53:44] <rwaldron> ajpiano anyway, pretty cool
[11:53:47] <ajpiano> yah, i 'm not crazy about the actual defulats he picked.... nowrap... inhead?
[11:53:53] <ajpiano> but still, useful to hand people
[11:53:59] <rwaldron> I think I will stick with my boilerplate that use
[11:54:13] <rwaldron> it uses Edge and has Firebug lite pre-checked
[11:54:48] <rwaldron> wtf
[11:54:59] <rwaldron> this guy with stringify is getting on my nerves
[11:55:56] <ajpiano> don't sweat it rwaldron
[11:56:21] <rwaldron> I'm not really
[11:56:34] <rwaldron> my strategy is working perfectly
[11:56:39] <rwaldron> file a ticket
[11:56:52] <ajpiano> i believe that all developers should be able to use jquery even if they mis type the characters, it should do fuzzy lookups on method names
[11:56:55] <rwaldron> open season.
[11:56:59] <ajpiano> that doesn't mean that the jquery team is gonna put it in
[11:57:00] <ajpiano> :
[11:57:01] <ajpiano> :p
[11:57:21] <rwaldron> i cant tell if you're serious
[11:57:32] <ajpiano> i am decidedly not
[11:57:45] * rwaldron sigh of relief
[11:58:04] <rwaldron> i was about to ask if you also wanted "fuzzy" bitwise operations
[19:44:52] <billwalton> i need some help understanding context
[19:46:14] <billwalton> just getting started on my first plugin.  not too far into learning jquery.  'this' inside the plugin is not what i understood it to be.
[19:47:14] <billwalton> hmmm...
[19:47:22] <billwalton> looks like my connection flaked out
[19:47:36] <billwalton> so...
[19:48:14] <billwalton> http://jsfiddle.net/yXBzc/
[19:48:33] <billwalton> anybody willing to take a look ?
[19:49:47] <billwalton> my understanding was that inside $.fn.findStretchyFields 'this' would be the object that the function was called on
[19:50:03] <billwalton> in my case, $(document)
[19:50:24] <billwalton> but if I do...
[19:51:28] <billwalton> an exception is thrown telling me that this.forms[0] is not a function
[20:02:19] <gibson042> .
