[10:58:11] <django_> hey everyone
[10:58:16] <django_> is it alright to ask about GSOC 2025 here?

[11:18:20] <m_gol> timmywil: please see https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2732#issuecomment-192888943 before the release
[11:20:39] <timmywil> m_gol: I guess it wouldn't hurt
[11:21:31] <m_gol> I went through other 3.0.0-milestoned issues and only this one caught my eye so maybe that's all
[11:21:54] <timmywil> It's a nice-to-have, but still not a blocker
[11:22:05] <m_gol> right
[11:22:50] <m_gol> though it should be trivial to cherry-pick :)
[11:23:12] <timmywil> yup, doing it now

[11:43:50] <m_gol> timmywil: the tests don't seem to pass in oldIE
[11:43:52] <m_gol> on 1.12
[11:44:07] <timmywil> attributes or isplain?
[11:44:36] <m_gol> isPlain
[11:44:39] <timmywil> ah, of course
[11:44:43] <m_gol> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1129486
[11:44:48] <timmywil> Object.create
[11:45:32] <m_gol> right
[11:45:37] <timmywil> I got it
[11:45:51] <m_gol> perhaps a polyfill on 1.12?
[11:46:12] <timmywil> nah, we'll just skip
[11:46:16] <m_gol> (a "polyfill" as we shouldn't put it on Object in tests)
[11:46:17] <m_gol> ok
[11:46:35] <m_gol> although it might we worth checking that case in oldIE as well
[11:46:42] <m_gol> so not sure if skipping is the best idea
[11:47:18] <timmywil> I don't think it's high enough priority to stick in a polyfill
[11:47:29] <timmywil> besides, we know it works
[11:47:39] <timmywil> and isPlainObject isn't changing there any time soon
[11:48:20] <timmywil> if it were the master branch, I'd say yes
[11:48:47] <gibson042> I agree with skipping anything depending on Object.create in 1.12
[11:49:39] <m_gol> it's an easily polyfillable API that used to be polyfilled quite often
[11:49:46] <m_gol> so such objects will exist in the wild
[11:49:52] <timmywil> it'll be fine
[11:51:08] <m_gol> ok, as you wish although it'd take me about 10 minutes ;)

[12:03:43] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: unmute
[12:50:45] <timmywil> m_gol: Perhaps you could email me that list of milestone changes when you get a change
[12:50:50] <timmywil> chance
[12:50:53] <m_gol> sure
[12:51:01] <timmywil> thanks
[12:51:07] <timmywil> gotta run for now
[12:52:03] <m_gol> timmywil: no need for mail, it's just https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3A1.12.0%2F2.2.0+%22This+has+been+backported%22
[12:52:20] <m_gol> 6 of them
[12:52:21] <timmywil> nice
[12:52:52] <timmywil> looks like 2, rather, since 4 are PRs
[12:53:23] <m_gol> if a PR has a milestone it's because it didn't have an assigned issue
[12:53:26] <m_gol> that has a milestone
[12:53:32] <m_gol> so it's a kinda issue+PR
[12:53:46] <timmywil> ok, I assumed the PRs have issues with milestones
[12:54:03] <m_gol> although I see we should e.g. move the milestone from the PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1988 to the issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1987
[12:54:25] <m_gol> but I know there are some PRs without issues and they have milestones
[12:54:31] <timmywil> anyway, I'll just check them all

[18:32:59] <m_gol> Hi django_; what project are you interested in? Did you see https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2016-Ideas-List?
[18:34:47] <m_gol> timmywil scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin: I removed Edge 12 from browser sets until BrowserStack unbreaks it
[18:34:59] <m_gol> Edge 13 is still fine & tested
[18:36:01] <django_> m_gol, hey thanks for the reply, i was thinking of this: jQuery Learning Center - Interactive tutorials for learn and other sites
[18:37:28] <m_gol> django_: great, people interested in docs/education stuff are definitely needed! You should talk to agcolom or AurelioDeRosa (they're both in London, though, so most likely sleeping already)
[18:37:39] <django_> right
[18:37:43] <django_> yes i love education
[18:37:59] <django_> m_gol, do they have out on IRC?
[18:38:27] <m_gol> yes, those are IRC links. I see Aurelio's nick changes to zz_AurelioDeRosa when he's away :)
[18:38:43] <django_> ohh heh
[18:38:52] <m_gol> ah, and the best channel for that will be #jquery-content, although they're here as well
[18:39:03] <m_gol> but maybe more people will be able to help there
[18:39:47] <django_> yeah i also messaged over there
[18:40:21] <django_> is there a lot of demand for these projects?
[18:42:03] <m_gol> agcolom will know more about specific projects but IMO more people are interested in libraries code than documentation/tutorials so I think it's needed
[18:42:40] <m_gol> I need to go to sleep now but do try to catch them tomorrow!
[18:42:51] <m_gol> see you
[18:47:08] <django_> m_gol, ok great ty and goodnight!!
