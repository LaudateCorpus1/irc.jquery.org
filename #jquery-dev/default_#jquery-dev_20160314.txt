[13:01:34] <all3fox> Hi, I noticed there are no GSoC Core ideas on the ideas list. Is that intentional?
[13:01:54] <markelog> m_gol: like this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TtjRViNYzJs :)

[13:02:11] <timmywil> all3fox: unfortunately, I don't think we had anyone available to mentor in core
[13:02:23] <markelog> all3fox: i have submitted two previously
[13:02:35] <markelog> but there is not a lot of spots open for it
[13:02:42] <all3fox> timmywill: A, ok, that explains it. Will try by Mobile then
[13:02:52] <all3fox> timmywill: thanks
[13:03:12] <timmywil> np
[13:03:24] <markelog> oh, i'm so used to be ignored, feels like i'm 18 again :)
[13:03:52] <m_gol> Burning a company MacBook might not be the best idea. :P
[13:04:00] <timmywil> markelog: did your ideas make it to the doc?
[13:04:28] <timmywil> I'm not sure there were core ideas that made it to the list.
[13:04:49] <markelog> timmywil: the were, but didn't get picked up
[13:04:52] <markelog>  the same ideas i had previously, but GSoC
[13:04:54] <m_gol> can the list be updated or is it impossible now that the program has begun?
[13:05:06] <timmywil> not sure
[13:05:10] <markelog> is really time consuming, even if you don't get picked up
[13:05:26] <timmywil> but I think we'd need a mentor if we wanted to have ideas posted
[13:05:32] <markelog> m_gol: do you want to be a mentor?
[13:06:13] <markelog> we probably wouldn't picked though anyway :)
[13:06:45] <m_gol> I won't have time in March, only from April forward, I don't know what the timeline is
[13:07:50] <all3fox> basically, timeline here https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/ (scroll a bit)
[13:07:59] <all3fox> basically, starts 22 April
[13:08:27] <all3fox> Or even May 23, depending on how yo define community bonding
[13:08:33] <m_gol> ah, but proposals need to be submitted before March 25?
[13:09:04] <all3fox> yes
[13:09:36] <m_gol> which means specific tasks for specific projects have to be available before March 25?
[13:10:12] <all3fox> I do not have much of a proposal tho: Mobile and Hammer have ideas about cleaning up their tests and issues, looks like Core could do that too
[13:11:21] <all3fox> No, you are already registered as an organisation -- you are fine. Now a student has to have a good proposal which you would like to pick. You can help students by giving ideas (like you have a list on github), but it is not a fixed list
[13:11:32] <m_gol> I see
[13:12:15] <all3fox> I do not know if you already must be registered as a mentor, tho. My bad. Maybe the org has to provide a list of mentors beforehand, dunno
[13:12:59] <m_gol> Core needs to get their tests moved from PHP to Node & runnable locally on an isolated Node server so that no PHP+Apache etc. setup is needed. But due to various integrations this is far from an easy task so this might be too much for a student summer project
[13:13:54] <all3fox> will not lie: not very skilled, so if you say that it is "too much" -- I would probably not complete that
[13:14:58] <m_gol> Core may be one of the hardest project of the jQuery line because it doesn't get many new features, mostly fixes/architecture changes so if you don't want to hit a rock, Mobile/UI might be a better fit :)
[13:15:18] <all3fox> ok, thx, I will try to jump to them then
[13:16:19] <m_gol> I'll try to think about something, though, there may be sth doable in a few months. If you're on this channel for the next week or so, I'll ping you if I think about sth :)
[13:16:42] <all3fox> great, will do
[13:17:31] <all3fox> keep in mind tho that after 25 March is too late. And one needs at least a day to write a decent proposal :)

[14:45:22] <snover> scott_gonzalez: hey, do you have a quick minute? i have a question about a jquery-license bug that you reported, which I cannot seem to reproduce or totally verify your explanation of what happened
[14:46:07] <snover> the explanation seemed plausible, except the refspec is actually separate from the url, so maybe it is just a difference in test environment.
