[15:15:46] <markelog> DaveMethvin: hey, have a sec?
[17:55:26] <markelog> DaveMethvin: you there?
[17:55:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah, here now
[17:56:31] <DaveMethvin> sup markelog 
[17:56:46] <markelog> Just stumble upon this perf - http://jsperf.com/jquery-off-with-callback/2
[17:57:13] <markelog> In absolute numbers it's okay i guess, but i wonder if we could improve it without hurting the byte size too much
[17:57:22] <markelog> what do you think?
[17:57:59] <DaveMethvin> let me look at the worst case, its still a big number but i have to run the bench
[17:58:51] <markelog> This probably happens because of the recursion
[17:58:58] <markelog> in jQuery.event.remove
[17:59:04] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[17:59:17] <DaveMethvin> even at 2600/sec it's not bad
[17:59:29] <markelog> yep
[17:59:31] <DaveMethvin> normally you're not attaching and detaching a lot
[17:59:44] <markelog> single page apps?
[17:59:47] <DaveMethvin> the recursion was for space saving i guess, it was there a while
[18:00:11] <DaveMethvin> ideally if you're using MV* you'd attach events to the container to avoid attach/detach
[18:00:34] <DaveMethvin> there could be situations where you can't avoid that, like a UI widget inside a view
[18:00:56] <DaveMethvin> but in those cases you're probably going through .cleanData
[18:01:03] <DaveMethvin> rather than explicitly calling .off
[18:01:12] <DaveMethvin> so it won't use namespaces
[18:02:23] <markelog> yeah, my colleague found this one, i don't know the specifics but it might real use case
[18:03:02] <markelog> https://github.com/ChrisAntaki was asking me if he could help out with some of the tickets, i'm thinking that could be one of them?
[18:03:35] <markelog> if it would be big, then no i guess, but if not?
[18:03:39] <DaveMethvin> if there's an easy fix i'm good with it
[18:04:06] <DaveMethvin> i wouldn't have thought of doing the recursion, it was there before i refactored in 1.7 and i must have left it in because a loop got it bigger
[18:05:26] <markelog> right, if we do weird things it because of the size or memory leaks for oldIE :-)
[18:05:58] <markelog> or just because of the oldIE altogether
[18:06:10] <markelog> okay, i'm gonna create ticket for it
[18:06:21] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[18:06:44] <markelog> btw, are we gonna create more labels?
[18:06:53] <markelog> like "core",  "effects" etc?
[18:07:07] <DaveMethvin> i dunno if we need that?
[18:07:43] <DaveMethvin> i used the categories in the changelog but by that point the commit message has a component too
[18:08:22] <markelog> it might be helpful to search stuff in github issues
[18:08:55] <markelog> similarly like we did in trac
[18:09:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah it might
[18:09:14] <DaveMethvin> do you want to create them?
[18:09:31] <DaveMethvin> i guess all you need right now is "event" :)
[18:09:36] <markelog> :-)
[18:10:03] <markelog> we have closed ones too - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+is%3Aissue+
[18:10:29] <markelog> founding those might be beneficial
[18:11:16] <DaveMethvin> i think we will end up having a lot more "junk" issues than real ones, wonder if there is an easy way to determine that difference without tagging
[18:11:35] <DaveMethvin> the ones referenced by PRs will usually be good
[18:11:54] <markelog> we could create label "junk" :-)
[18:12:07] <DaveMethvin> we'll  use it too much! :)
[18:12:23] <DaveMethvin> we could tag the good ones with "bug" or "feature" 
[18:12:30] <DaveMethvin> i had just figured we'd tag features
[18:12:37] <DaveMethvin> and assume the rest were bugs
[18:13:12] <DaveMethvin> what does mobile do, let me look
[18:13:48] <markelog> wow, they have a lot
[18:13:55] <DaveMethvin> they tag components
[18:14:33] <markelog> should we do the same - like "Component: Effects"?
[18:14:39] <DaveMethvin> dunno if they use the naming scheme for other processing, we'll need to check with arschmitz 
[18:14:48] <DaveMethvin> that might explain why those are prefixed
[18:15:12] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: whats up?
[18:15:22] <markelog> we wonder about your labels
[18:15:34] <DaveMethvin> in the issue tracker
[18:15:35] <markelog> prefixes mostly
[18:15:41] <arschmitz> ah 
[18:15:45] <DaveMethvin> do you have some program that processes them, and thus the prefixes?
[18:16:03] <arschmitz> we were going to
[18:16:17] <DaveMethvin> well dammit, we can't steal your code :) 
[18:16:31] <arschmitz> it was going to be for the changelog
[18:16:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's what i figured
[18:16:42] <arschmitz> which ps now that your on github issues does not work any more
[18:17:00] <DaveMethvin> our changelog barely worked on trac really
[18:17:06] <DaveMethvin> i guess ui was better at organizing it
[18:17:20] <arschmitz> yeah gotta be strict about your commit messages
[18:17:27] <DaveMethvin> and tickets
[18:17:40] <arschmitz> yup
[18:17:49] <arschmitz> we currently use a custom changelog script i wrote
[18:17:55] <arschmitz> based off the one for trac
[18:18:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think it would be pretty easy to sort something out
[18:18:14] <gibson042> the former will be much better with commitplease 1.11.0
[18:18:36] <DaveMethvin> oh the commit messages?
[18:18:52] <gibson042> we can now specify an array of valid components
[18:19:05] <DaveMethvin> plus "misc" :)
[18:19:53] <markelog> arschmitz: so you use "Component" prefix because of the changelog script?
[18:20:31] <DaveMethvin> if we don't mind having a little bit of noise in the processing script we can avoid the prefixes and keep the tags short
[18:21:03] <DaveMethvin> so just keep a list of component names in the script and use "Effects" rather than "Component: Effects"
[18:21:19] <markelog> i think it could work without prefixes
[18:21:58] <DaveMethvin> we're in a green field here so we can pretty much do it any way we want
[18:22:08] <markelog> alrighty, i'm gonna create those tomorrow
[18:22:12] <arschmitz> to be honest there is no reason for the labels
[18:22:15] <DaveMethvin> and I don't think we'll end up with more than 100 or so bugs in steady state
[18:22:30] <markelog> hope it would never happen )
[18:22:32] <arschmitz> I didnt make them that way and we dont really use them that way and there is nothing that depends on them being that way
[18:22:42] <DaveMethvin> ok that's good to know arschmitz 
[18:23:04] <DaveMethvin> markelog: i may look around a few other projects for some ideas
[18:23:11] <arschmitz> id actually be happy to settle on a label scheme and share it
[18:23:14] <markelog> okay, i'm on hold then )
[18:23:31] <DaveMethvin> we can always discuss on monday at the meeting
[18:23:44] <DaveMethvin> it won't be hard to add to the small number of tickets we have
[18:24:45] <markelog> btw gibson042: what is the status of https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/279
[18:24:45] <markelog> ?
[18:24:50] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: let me know what you are thinking for labels i dont really like how ours are right now
[18:25:16] <DaveMethvin> ok arschmitz, not sure there is any great solution unless someone else has made some good tools
[18:25:18] <gibson042> markelog: I'm actually resolving it now
[18:25:30] <gibson042> creating the failing unit test has been a bitch
[18:25:39] <markelog> gibson042: cool, i'm the mind reader then :-)
[18:25:41] <gibson042> and the solution I settled on abuses karma pretty badly
[18:25:45] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: by the way congrats on having the only website iv checked so far with no broken links
[18:25:46] <markelog> yeah, iframes right!
[18:25:57] <gibson042> I'll make a PR and cc you
[18:25:57] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[18:26:02] <markelog> cool
[18:26:57] <markelog> btw, if you saw fallures in the travis because something stop working on the browserstack side - please let me know
[18:27:10] <markelog> with the karma i mean
[18:27:48] <markelog> we had faillures with 2.3 android again because browsertack has removed some one of the platforms
[18:29:25] <gibson042> where should I be looking?
