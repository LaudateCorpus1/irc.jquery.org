[04:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: $.uiBackCompat was me. You're welcome.
[05:06:40] <dzigi_> hello, I'm currently working on making site compatible with ie8 but I've hit somewhat of a wall...
[05:06:42] <dzigi_> namely, I access the site via ie9 go into dev tools select browser mode to ie8 and when I try to debug scripts imidiatly I get 'SCRIPT5009: 'jQuery' is undefined' errors
[05:06:49] <dzigi_> and a ton of them too (
[05:07:38] <dzigi_> could you point me to the possible source of problem (other then stop using ie8 x)
[05:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> Who use Stack Overflow? I have an etiquette question.

[10:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> In case you have any other feedback.
[10:30:39] <scott_gonzalez> Also, can we actually land getBoundingClientRect() for width/height?
[10:30:57] <scott_gonzalez> Or will that really just totally break the Internet?
[10:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> $( elem ).realHeight()
[10:32:04] <DaveMethvin> you just know people will freak out if those aren't integers...they did last time that snuck in scott_gonzalez
[10:32:36] <DaveMethvin> "lie to me, i feel better about it that way"
[10:32:43] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, and the UI team flipped tables and cursed like crazy when we had to deal with fractional pixels.
[10:32:52] <DaveMethvin> YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!
[10:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> But, shit is broken, as Boris keeps telling us.
[10:33:06] <DaveMethvin> so true
[10:33:28] <DaveMethvin> i just don't look forward to the shitstorm that will happen when 8 years worth of old plugins break
[10:33:29] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov and I felt the pain first hand while I was at his house and we were working on UI effects.
[10:33:35] <scott_gonzalez> "Why is this off by 1 pixel?"
[10:33:58] <DaveMethvin> it's not a *whole* pixel, just 0.8231 of a pixel silly boy
[10:34:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but then THAT gets rounded for display, right?
[10:34:24] <scott_gonzalez> So visually it's a full pixel :-)
[10:34:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah, or truncated who knows what offsetLeft etc do
[10:34:57] <DaveMethvin> we can look it up in the spec...oh wait

[11:19:05] <gibson042> I don't even know what to tell them
[11:19:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah i kind of feel guilty, it's like seeing kids run out into the street to get a ball

[11:27:24] <DaveMethvin> I'm with mislav there, if they don't like the way qSA behaves then they need Sizzle
[12:12:57] <scott_gonzalez> Hah, we've reached the point where Zepto has more open issues than jQuery.
[12:13:04] <snover> BUT ITâ€™S SMALLER
[12:13:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they're really good at cramming those bugs into their code.
[12:24:09] <DaveMethvin> There's that fine balance between bug count and line count ... we'll call the sweet spot the Snover Peak
[13:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry guys, I just got an offer to work at "a fierce startup culture with a pedigree of minds forged at institutions such as Harvard, MIT, and Princeton" and "disrupt a 160-billion-dollar business". I'm outta here!
[13:13:18] <DaveMethvin> $160 billion? Must be a porn site
[13:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, home improvement industry.
[13:14:05] <scott_gonzalez> Something about partnering with Home Depot.
[13:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> Shockingly, I didn't take the time to dig in and get the details.
[13:14:31] <DaveMethvin> well you have hands-on experience with that industry
[13:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[13:15:17] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if I have any kind of non-compete that would prevent this.
[13:15:29] <scott_gonzalez> I worked on stuff for Lowe's when I was at appendTo.
[14:17:40] <snover> scott_gonzalez: it depends on how awful your lawyers were when drafting contracts, it would generally fall under trade secrets
[14:17:56] <snover> but such non-competes are mostly unenforceable

[22:17:03] <Krinkle> nschonni: I did
[22:17:15] <JamesMGreene> Won't the "*" catch the ".jshintrc" already?
[22:17:30] <JamesMGreene> Or does it not include dotfiles?
[22:17:36] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: No, * doesn't include dotfiles. Never (not in bash either).
[22:17:46] <JamesMGreene> oic
[22:18:07] <Krinkle> nschonni: That paste wasn't about adding grunt/watch. In the deal commit (pushed a few minutes ago) I did use ~0.3.0
[22:18:12] <Krinkle> real*
[22:18:13] <JamesMGreene> What about ".?*" :)
[22:18:22] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: It's not a regex
[22:18:30] <JamesMGreene> pisshaw :-o
[22:18:37] <JamesMGreene> globbing is for the birds
[22:18:38] <nschonni> k, i just noticed it in the gist
[22:18:50] <Krinkle> nschonni: no worries, thanks for the eye
[22:19:45] <JamesMGreene> Do the addon tests actually need the jQuery predef? I'd assume not
[22:20:42] <Krinkle> Indeed. I thought I removed all the redundant ones
[22:20:44] <Krinkle> Fixed
[22:21:58] <JamesMGreene> QUnit.current_testEnvironment = this.testEnvironment;
[22:22:11] <JamesMGreene> ^ that works? I thought the /*jshint directives were function-scoped
[22:22:23] <JamesMGreene> hey, that did not paste right....
[22:22:31] <Krinkle> https://gist.github.com/Krinkle/e989c74301b1ebabc0c3#file-git-commit-diff-L181
[22:22:32] <JamesMGreene> Ah, slashes
[22:22:49] <JamesMGreene> Yes, there
[22:23:03] <Krinkle> They are function scoped yes, but linear scope within the function scope
[22:23:05] <JamesMGreene> And so I repeat: that works? I thought the /*jshint directives were function-scoped
[22:23:18] <JamesMGreene> hmm, interesting
[22:23:30] <Krinkle> So /*jshint x:true */ will only set x to true from that point on until the end of the function
[22:23:46] <Krinkle> In a small function you'd put it on top
[22:23:56] <Krinkle> in a longer function I wrap it around the offending lines
[22:24:15] <Krinkle> and reset afterwards for the remainder of the function
[22:24:18] <JamesMGreene> -	extend( window, QUnit );
[22:24:18] <JamesMGreene> +	extend( window, QUnit.constructor.prototype );
[22:24:22] <JamesMGreene> ?
[22:24:34] <Krinkle> https://gist.github.com/Krinkle/e989c74301b1ebabc0c3#file-git-commit-diff-L9-L12
[22:25:26] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/qunit/qunit.js#L677-685
[22:25:49] <Krinkle> I ran into it when I changed extend() to filter own properties
[22:26:16] <Krinkle> suddenly all tests broke as extend(window, QUnit) became a no-op. It didn't do anything, since QUnit doesn't have any own properties
[22:29:02] <JamesMGreene> I see
[22:30:00] <JamesMGreene> https://gist.github.com/Krinkle/e989c74301b1ebabc0c3#file-git-commit-diff-L352  <-- add spaces around ||?
[22:30:49] <JamesMGreene> And space pad the parens that the || is in? (I think?)
[22:31:23] <Krinkle> In the touched lines, okay. I'm not going to do everything though, just where in the same scope.
[22:31:31] <Krinkle> atomic commits
[22:34:25] <JamesMGreene> sure
[22:34:30] <JamesMGreene> LGTM

[22:35:50] <JamesMGreene> Crock and I disagree on the IIFE parens

[22:39:51] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: I have a good track record of convincing people of using (function () { .. }()) (not just because they have to for the convention of the code being edited, but in general)
[22:40:03] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: To start off, tell me why it makes sense to put () on the outside?
[22:40:28] <doesallmagic> Project QUnit build #286: SUCCESS in 1 min 55 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/286/
[22:40:28] <doesallmagic> Timo Tijhof: Deprecate QUnit.current_testEnvironment in favour of config.current.testEnvironment.
[22:41:38] <JamesMGreene> Seems more widely used in the community, aesthetically pleasing, makes more sense to my brain in that the wrapping parens for the function more obviously differentiate it as a function expression
[22:42:15] <Krinkle> Except for the latter part, they're not justifiable arguments
[22:42:22] <Krinkle> As for the latter, let me explain
[22:42:38] <Krinkle> Functions don't need to be wrapped.
[22:42:45] <JamesMGreene> I know
[22:43:00] <Krinkle> The reason we wrap IIFE is to indicate that the return value is the result of the invocation, not the function itself.
[22:43:03] <JamesMGreene> Like I said, it just makes more sense to my brain that way :)
[22:43:15] <Krinkle> So you want to wrap the "special" thing.
[22:43:23] <JamesMGreene> I know that too, but I feel that the other style achieves the same
[22:43:48] <Krinkle> var x = function () {}(); that's what happens
[22:44:04] <Krinkle> var x = ( function () {}() ); // wrap to indicate special
[22:44:29] <Krinkle> Wrapping half of it does not make sense.
[22:44:35] <JamesMGreene> P.S. I saw him give this same talk in person
[22:44:43] <JamesMGreene> He convinced me of multiple style changes but not this one
[22:44:57] <Krinkle> Did my indoctrination work? 
[22:45:11] <JamesMGreene> Well you said the same thing he does, so not especially :)
[22:45:19] <JamesMGreene> I'm not vehemently against it or anything
[22:45:24] <JamesMGreene> I just prefer the other way
[22:45:27] <Krinkle> just messing with ya
[22:45:48] <Krinkle> Anyhow, most important is that you do it my way.
[22:45:49] <Krinkle> xD
[22:45:58] <JamesMGreene> lol
[22:46:12] <JamesMGreene> Crockford was much more reasonable in person than I expected
[22:46:19] <Krinkle> I was going to say, most important is style changes that have maintenance or side effects.
[22:46:33] <JamesMGreene> I thought he'd be a crotchedy old grump :)
[22:46:43] <Krinkle> The ones that are only different with no other side effects, I don't care about as long as we're consistent within a project
[22:47:00] <Krinkle> IIFE style is in the category that doesn't matter, has no advantage other than personal preference. Pick and and stick to it.
[22:47:25] <Krinkle> Things like semi colons, curly braces etc. those are style guides that "matter"
[22:49:20] <Krinkle> Which is why jshint dropped the preference for iffe style
[22:49:49] <Krinkle> both ways are allowed when restricting immed:true
[22:58:00] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: Good to know
[23:03:42] <JamesMGreene> In other news, I think ben_alman convinced me to use spaces instead of tabs
[23:03:47] <JamesMGreene> Didn't see that one comin'
[23:04:07] <JamesMGreene> Well, at least in an OSS environment
[23:04:31] <JamesMGreene> I'll probably stick to tabs at corporate where I can just make people use the same IDE settings
[23:46:29] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: ?? explain
[23:46:50] <Krinkle> how are IDE settings relevant
