[07:59:13] <JamesMGreene> Heeeeeeeeeey Krinkle|detached, you going to be around for the meeting?  If not, let's skip it since jzaefferer is out.
[08:07:38] <m_gol> I start to understand rwaldron irritation about people pushing classList ;)
[08:07:57] <m_gol> (even though I once created a pull request by myself)
[08:09:35] <JamesMGreene> No surprise here
[08:09:55] <JamesMGreene> They made an array-like object without Array prototype methods
[08:10:02] <JamesMGreene> Like `arguments`
[08:10:06] <JamesMGreene> It's gonna happen
[08:14:31] <m_gol> it's not array, rather set
[08:14:53] <m_gol> though officially it's DOMTokenList, i.e. sth different than set
[08:21:12] <rwaldron> m_gol <3
[08:21:22] <rwaldron> we all want to make jQuery the best
[08:21:54] <rwaldron> "DOMTokenList" so gros
[08:21:56] <rwaldron> gross*
[08:27:42] <JamesMGreene> Yeah... DOM APIs make me sad/mad
[08:27:48] <JamesMGreene> [most]
[08:40:30] <m_gol> yeah, it even sounds weird
[08:40:44] <m_gol> who would think DOMTokenList is just a Set, but a little different
[08:42:05] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: We can do a quick sync over irc now if you like. What's your status?
[08:42:48] <Krinkle> My status is: Get last confirmation that the split is good to go in 1.x current master, land it, then review/rebase/land your nodejs change
[08:42:55] <Krinkle> I'd like to do a release this week or next wek.
[09:11:16] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: I'm still basically out of commission, maybe even 2 more weeks
[09:11:22] <Krinkle> k
[09:11:27] <JamesMGreene> Looked over your split, though, LGTM
[10:17:43] <m_gol> rwaldron: WebKit Nightly works on Mavericks now :)
[10:22:12] <rwaldron> m_gol rad!
