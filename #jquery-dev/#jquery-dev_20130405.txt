[09:57:14] <m_gol> nice party they must be having now at Google
[09:57:28] <m_gol> first Canary fails 92 jQuery unit tests ;)
[09:57:58] <DaveMethvin> they can do better than that!
[09:58:21] <DaveMethvin> pretty impressive considering they said they deleted 7000 lines of code
[10:04:18] <m_gol> yeah, I supposed it'll be pretty unusable at the beginning but at least it compiles and runs and even sort-of-works ;)
[10:05:28] <m_gol> btw, I pushed a new commit to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1220
[10:05:29] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #1220 by mzgol (20h 31m ago): improved CSS rules, updated support comments
[10:32:47] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 are you around?
[10:35:51] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, is there any policy of using jQuery's BrowserStack accounts for not purely jQuery development purposes?
[10:36:26] <DaveMethvin> no problem if you need to test some stuff for other projects
[10:36:34] <m_gol> ok, thx!

[14:43:59] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 yeah but are you here NOW?
[14:44:08] <gibson042> more or less
[14:44:26] <DaveMethvin> just wanted to run a quick sanity check by you
[14:44:38] <DaveMethvin> i'm looking at what it would take to change script running to optional
[14:44:50] <DaveMethvin> i think we should make this a six-month-out thing
[14:44:55] <DaveMethvin> and discuss it
[14:45:10] <DaveMethvin> because although i think it can be done, it's gonna take some code changes for users
[14:45:44] <DaveMethvin> if I do .append(something-with-scripts) there needs to be some way to make the scripts run
[14:46:22] <gibson042> I agree; we don't want to rush this
[14:46:46] <DaveMethvin> the nice thing is that we get rid of a lot of gnarly stuff about deciding whether to run scripts
[14:47:08] <DaveMethvin> although you did get most of that debugged by now :)
[14:47:38] <DaveMethvin> okay well in that case i think we are almost ready for a beta
[14:47:46] <DaveMethvin> imma look at the pull q tonight
[14:48:05] <DaveMethvin> and also made a couple more pulls, take a look if you have some time
[14:48:25] <DaveMethvin> so that's it for now ... gotta go
[14:50:49] <gibson042> allright; will do
[19:21:14] <m_gol> lol
[19:21:15] <m_gol> JSON
[19:21:15] <m_gol> "TypeError"
[19:21:27] <m_gol> in Canary console
[21:28:25] <gnarf> ajpiano: you around
[21:28:40] <gnarf> did you see my comment earlier regarding jenknis.jquery.(com|org) ?
