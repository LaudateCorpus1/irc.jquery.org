[11:54:17] <m_gol> timmywil DaveMethvin: re jQuery.swap, I see a mention in the meeting that it's used internally a lot... Is it? I only see one use in css on master
[11:54:24] <m_gol> and it's for marginRight in old Android
[11:54:42] <DaveMethvin> i think there are just two uses
[11:54:47] <DaveMethvin> marginRight is one
[11:54:56] <DaveMethvin> and width/height of hidden elements is the other?
[11:55:56] <m_gol> right, 2
[11:56:00] <m_gol> still, not a lot :)
[11:56:04] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[11:56:10] <DaveMethvin> not sure where the lot came from
[11:56:39] <m_gol> I was actually thinking about removing it when discussing my PR fixing marginRight tests in Android 4.0-4.3
[11:56:58] <m_gol> if it was fully internal, we could tweak it so it better fits those few cases which might decrease its size

[11:59:44] <m_gol> I wonder why we still expose it at all...
[12:00:00] <m_gol> we shouldn't have internal helpers exposed, we don't need to do it with current AMD setup
[12:00:08] <DaveMethvin> not really sure, we never documented it
[12:00:28] <DaveMethvin> and it's such a BAD idea from a perf perspective
[12:10:59] <m_gol> even if we want to preserve it, we shouldn't expose it
