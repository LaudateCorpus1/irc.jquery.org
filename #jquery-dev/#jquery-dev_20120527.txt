[11:41:22] <Krinkle> OMG! The qunit-fixture in jquery/test is fragile as hell. One little tickle and all hell brakes loose in unit tests
[11:45:04] <Krinkle> I wish I never started this witch hunt, if I know it was that fragile I wouldn't have started. Grrr
[11:46:18] <snover> loose brakes? that sounds dangerous.
[11:56:39] <Krinkle> snover: Yeah, the tests for prev() and next() etc. don't have dedicated elements, they re-use random ones in the fixutre
[11:56:48] <Krinkle> meaning if you add anything anywhere, those all break
[11:57:04] <Krinkle> Refactoring a little bit to make those more stable
[12:16:55] <Krinkle> Argh! and of course the sizzle test suite depends on it as well.
[12:18:58] <snover> Krinkle: “break”
[12:19:06] <Krinkle> ?
[12:19:14] <Krinkle> 6586 tests of 6586 passed, 0 failed.
[12:19:16] <Krinkle> Yay :)
[12:19:34] <snover> brake = a thing that slows something down
[12:19:48] <Krinkle> Oh, I know. I type too fast
