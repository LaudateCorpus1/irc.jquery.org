[06:19:41] <timmywil> i dunno why, but "misleadingly" is irksome
[06:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> how do I get bot-t to do ?#000 with UI tickets?
[06:29:21] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: botty doesn't seem to be around at the moment, so it's a moot point
[06:29:30] <ajpiano> when he's back i'll check for ya
[06:29:36] <scott_gonzalez> bot-t1: tell ajpiano he's dump
[06:29:37] <bot-t1> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[06:29:41] <scott_gonzalez> creap
[06:29:42] <scott_gonzalez> dumb
[06:29:43] <ajpiano> damnit bot-t1
[06:29:44] <bot-t1> (7 secs ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell ajpiano he's dump
[06:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:29:58] <scott_gonzalez> I suck at typing
[06:30:09] <scott_gonzalez> as evidenced by the dump and creap
[06:30:42] <ajpiano> gah
[06:30:49] <ajpiano> i know it'spossible, just can't remmeber the command
[06:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> bot-t1: impart wisdom upon us

[06:31:48] <timmywil> ha
[06:32:48] <timmywil> temp01
[06:34:11] <scott_gonzalez> did bot-t.com ever exist?
[06:34:42] <timmywil> it did, hasn't worked for a long time
[06:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> what Opera versions do we support now?
[06:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.com still says Opera 9.0+
[06:47:34] <scott_gonzalez> also FF 2.0+
[06:58:18] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: you can do jqbug.com/ui/1234 but i don't know if there's a direct bot shortcut
[06:58:49] <scott_gonzalez> will bot-t show info about it thought?
[06:58:53] <scott_gonzalez> jqbug.com/ui/1234
[06:59:00] <scott_gonzalez> http://jqbug.com/ui/1234
[06:59:08] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[07:01:53] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: yea the homepage should probably be updated. http://docs.jquery.com/Browser_Compatibility
[07:03:41] <scott_gonzalez> for Opera, what is Current -1?
[07:03:53] <timmywil> 10+
[07:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so full versions like every other browser
[07:04:40] <timmywil> I would suppose so
[07:05:55] <scott_gonzalez> I always think of Opera X.YZ having X.Y as the "major" version
[07:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> but I think the same thing for Firefox X.Y.Z
[07:09:21] <scott_gonzalez> 10+ means we're supporting 10.0x, 10.1x, 10.5x, 10.6x, 11.0x, 11.1x, 11.5x
[07:09:55] <scott_gonzalez> that's more than IE :-P
[07:14:01] <timmywil> I'll just check opera latest locally until we testswarm
[07:14:18] <timmywil> and sometimes we don't testswarm :P
[07:14:28] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yt?
[07:14:48] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yep
[07:15:07] <timmywil> what say we testswarm before we release
[07:15:15] <timmywil> today that is
[07:15:27] <DaveMethvin> sounds good to me ...
[07:15:43] <DaveMethvin> now, who can do that?
[07:16:11] <DaveMethvin> are we really supporting all the way back to Opera 10.x?
[07:16:47] <DaveMethvin> i thought we were only supporting the latest two 11s a this point
[07:16:59] <DaveMethvin> i haven't been testing in 10
[07:17:34] <timmywil> well our homepage says 9+
[07:17:45] <DaveMethvin> you trust that? :P
[07:17:48] <timmywil> hehe
[07:18:11] <DaveMethvin> i think 11 came out in January and given its small market share it seems like a lot of busy work to support 10
[07:19:14] <ajpiano> yo guys can i run a data attr thing by you
[07:19:25] <DaveMethvin> oh my favorite topic ajpiano
[07:19:34] <DaveMethvin> NOT
[07:19:34] <ajpiano> dude in #jquery saying how data attrs that are already camelcased get coerced down to lowercase
[07:19:41] <ajpiano> i told him that's intended and we had it wrong before 1.6
[07:19:45] <ajpiano> http://jsfiddle.net/JxFtn/
[07:19:47] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: well, we haven't seen if there are even fails yet
[07:19:53] <timmywil> there probably are tho
[07:20:16] <ajpiano> so data-fooBar is only accessible as data("foobar") in 1.6
[07:20:33] <DaveMethvin> timmywil:  can you set up a testswarm run?
[07:20:46] <DaveMethvin> i'm never against testing
[07:20:56] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it takes more than just me tho
[07:20:59] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano:  his test makes bad assumptions
[07:21:06] <ajpiano> ya but that's not the problem
[07:21:07] <timmywil> I can contribute quite a few browsers
[07:21:12] <DaveMethvin> attribute names in HTML are always lowercased
[07:21:17] <ajpiano> the potential problem - or misunderstanding
[07:21:26] <ajpiano> is that data-Foobar is still accessible as data("Foobar")
[07:21:36] <ajpiano> as is data-FooBar
[07:21:47] <ajpiano> even on edge
[07:21:54] <ajpiano> and i'm not sure if that's right or wrong
[07:22:03] <DaveMethvin> that's a different test case than what you showed tho
[07:22:07] <ajpiano> ya
[07:22:22] <ajpiano> i told him what you told me
[07:22:23] <ajpiano> [10:17:48] <Nomikos> ajpiano: ok, that makes sense. Am I nitpicking if I point out that data-Foobar with data('Foobar') does still work in edge? :-)
[07:22:24] <ajpiano> :p
[07:22:39] <ajpiano> so i wanted to run it by you guys to see if its still bugging
[07:22:47] <DaveMethvin> now why would that work? hmmm
[07:22:55] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin:  http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/JxFtn/1/
[07:23:01] <timmywil> why not let fooBar get lowercased
[07:23:22] <ajpiano> timmywil: fooBar gets lowercased just fine, but FooBar gets lowercased/camelcased to Foobar instead of foobar
[07:23:25] <ajpiano> it seems
[07:23:42] <DaveMethvin> gota be the dash from the data- part?
[07:23:46] <DaveMethvin> lemme look at the code
[07:23:52] <ajpiano> kk
[07:23:53] <timmywil> ajpiano: no i mean, why don't we just lowercase all the time
[07:23:58] <DaveMethvin> b/c we may want a fix in 1.6.4
[07:24:00] <ajpiano> timmywil: i known't :)
[07:24:05] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: my thoughts exactly ;)
[07:24:09] <ajpiano> was kind of a now-or-never moment
[07:24:18] <DaveMethvin> well then i choose NEVER! :P
[07:24:24] <ajpiano> WRONG DECISION
[07:24:27] <ajpiano> *cave collapse*
[07:24:35] <ajpiano> hope you brought your magic carpet
[07:25:25] <timmywil> INFADELS
[07:26:00] <ajpiano> why does al qaeda only use linux?!?!
[07:26:09] <ajpiano> cause they don't want to be infi-dells
[07:26:25] <ajpiano> :|
[07:26:29] <timmywil> lol
[07:28:45] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: ugh
[07:29:01] <DaveMethvin> var name = "data-" + key.replace( rmultiDash, "-$1" ).toLowerCase();
[07:29:11] <DaveMethvin> so that's when it goes to get the data attr
[07:29:27] <ajpiano> :'(
[07:29:29] <DaveMethvin> the leading cap is ignored since it's not preceded by a -
[07:29:37] <DaveMethvin> then the whole thing is lowerecased
[07:29:42] <DaveMethvin> so FooBar becomes foo-bar
[07:29:46] <DaveMethvin> but so does fooBar
[07:30:06] <DaveMethvin> seems to me that FooBar should be -foo-bar???
[07:30:41] <DaveMethvin> timmywil what do you think? ^
[07:31:27] <DaveMethvin> i think i am gonna go over into the corner there and rock for a while
[07:31:53] <timmywil> i'm confused where is this?
[07:32:07] <DaveMethvin> in the processing for the data- attrs (data.js function dataAttr
[07:33:59] <DaveMethvin> seems to me that .data("fooBar") should look for a data-foo-bar attribute and .data("FooBar") should look for data--foo-bar
[07:34:03] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[07:34:07] <rwaldron> hey there
[07:34:12] <rwaldron> i'm in a meeting at the moment
[07:34:15] <ajpiano> rwaldron: i think i found a data- camelcasing edgecase :/
[07:34:22] <DaveMethvin> damn camels
[07:34:28] <ajpiano> rather, the collective We did
[07:34:32] <DaveMethvin> finish your meeting rwaldron
[07:34:36] <DaveMethvin> we'll still be here
[07:34:49] <timmywil> yea, but why is it looking there again, it's in our cache?
[07:35:08] <DaveMethvin> no it came up with undefined
[07:35:11] <DaveMethvin> so it looked again
[07:35:12] <rwaldron> why would you look for "FooBar" if the data-* was data-foo-bar
[07:35:25] <DaveMethvin> seems to me that .data("fooBar") should look for a data-foo-bar attribute and .data("FooBar") should look for data--foo-bar
[07:35:34] <DaveMethvin> that leading cap?
[07:35:50] <timmywil> hmm, I'm thinking .data('fooBar') should look in our cache for $.cache.foobar
[07:36:05] <timmywil> and same with FooBar
[07:36:32] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: the cache is just the data object for that element
[07:36:39] <rwaldron> hm
[07:36:49] <rwaldron> is data--foo-bar even valid?
[07:36:57] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: i was wondering the same
[07:37:03] <DaveMethvin> lemme test
[07:37:13] <ajpiano> rwaldron: the issue is really that data-FooBar should technically *not* be accessible as .data("Foobar"), only as data("foobar") but right now it's both
[07:37:15] <rwaldron> its not
[07:37:18] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: but if we go the route where everything gets put in the cache on first read, there's no need to read data-attrs anymore
[07:37:37] <rwaldron> well, fuck. maybe it it is
[07:37:44] <rwaldron> A custom data attribute is an attribute in no namespace whose name starts with the string "data-", has at least one character after the hyphen, is XML-compatible, and contains no characters in the range U+0041 to U+005A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A to LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z).
[07:38:08] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: agreed but that code isn't in there atm ... :)
[07:38:48] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: all the caps are lowercased since they're attrs so that part doesn't matter, right?
[07:38:51] <rwaldron> here we go
[07:39:01] <rwaldron> "The algorithm for setting names to certain values"
[07:39:06] <rwaldron> If name contains a U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character (-) followed by a character in the range U+0061 to U+007A (U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A to U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER Z), throw a SYNTAX_ERR exception and abort these steps.
[07:39:38] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yes, all are lower cased anyway
[07:40:08] <DaveMethvin> damn jsfiddle you slow
[07:40:54] <rwaldron> ajpiano anyway, it seems that "data-FooBar" isn't valid
[07:41:04] <rwaldron> because it will be turned into "data-foobar"
[07:41:34] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: right, but you can get it with .data("Foobar") and the question is do we want that?
[07:41:55] <rwaldron> I'm indifferent.
[07:42:08] <DaveMethvin> http://jsfiddle.net/JxFtn/2/
[07:42:13] <rwaldron> It was really nice to reduce the code in that patch
[07:42:33] <DaveMethvin> data--foobar is accessible via .data("-foobar")
[07:42:46] <DaveMethvin> dunno if that is covered by the standard or not tho
[07:43:07] <DaveMethvin> jsfiddle is just too slow today at least for me
[07:43:38] <rwaldron> it's not, see above
[07:44:18] <rwaldron> because `dataset` can't do that
[07:44:41] <DaveMethvin> in dataset you'd just say .dataset.Foobar right?
[07:44:47] <DaveMethvin> for data--foobar
[07:45:11] <ajpiano> rwaldron: yea , what dave just said
[07:45:43] <DaveMethvin> it seems strange to let .data("Foobar") get data-foobar
[07:45:57] <ajpiano> it's that we're saying "we're gonna force everything to lowercase" and then in reality, there's a case where everything *isn't* forced to lower case
[07:46:05] <rwaldron> hm. the spec says A, chrome does B
[07:46:11] * rwaldron kicks self
[07:46:15] <timmywil> how is it not getting converted to data--foobar
[07:46:22] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/NHN5n/
[07:46:25] <ajpiano> but since it *works* with lowercase just fine, i don't think we should tear our hair out over it
[07:46:45] <timmywil> we changed rmultidash to replace all uppercase with -
[07:47:00] <timmywil> it shouldn't matter that there's no lowercase in front of it
[07:47:10] <timmywil> anymore
[07:49:42] <DaveMethvin> http://jsfiddle.net/JxFtn/7/  Is this the desired behavior?
[07:49:51] <timmywil> ahah, jquery-git isn't updated
[07:49:56] <timmywil> in your face
[07:49:59] <DaveMethvin> haha
[07:50:01] <ajpiano> oh noes :/
[07:50:16] <DaveMethvin> so why wouldn't git update?
[07:50:21] <DaveMethvin> it's a nightly job or something
[07:50:29] <timmywil> it should happen like every 10 min
[07:50:34] <timmywil> maybe less
[07:50:44] <rwaldron> jQuery JavaScript Library v1.6.4pre Live From Git (d7f615a5ebc8c38df3118ad89cc30098e8f66a2d)
[07:51:12] <DaveMethvin> ok, so where is that job and why did it break?
[07:51:23] <DaveMethvin> maybe danheberden knows
[07:52:08] <danheberden> DaveMethvin which one?
[07:52:14] <rwaldron> looks good to me
[07:52:19] <DaveMethvin> jquery-git.js
[07:52:22] <rwaldron> i just copied that from http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js
[07:53:02] <timmywil> that's not hthe latest tho
[07:53:13] <rwaldron> no
[07:53:14] <rwaldron> ?
[07:53:17] <DaveMethvin> i just did three commits yesterday
[07:53:17] <rwaldron> 1.6.4pre?
[07:53:22] <danheberden> the revert probably fucked up the pull
[07:53:24] <timmywil> 69585ba3c7f4f49b6370f63963b7317698ead861
[07:53:27] <timmywil> is the latest
[07:53:28] <rwaldron> oh duh
[07:53:40] <rwaldron> sorry, i shouldnt try to participate while I'm in a meeting
[07:53:48] <rwaldron> but i hate this project
[07:53:50] <DaveMethvin> go meet rwaldron
[07:54:16] <timmywil> yea, the stuff I did to fix the branch probably screwed it up
[07:54:38] <DaveMethvin> just confused it I suspect ... I know it confused me
[07:54:59] <DaveMethvin> it all started with the bad run of the release.js script
[07:55:06] <DaveMethvin> downhill from there
[07:55:19] <danheberden> mergggge conflict
[07:55:27] <timmywil> i bet ha
[07:55:32] <timmywil> remake the branch
[07:56:09] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil, do you know what we need to do for the testswarm run?
[07:56:25] <DaveMethvin> I'm keeping a log of all this stuff since it's my first time thru
[07:56:57] <DaveMethvin> and it's not written down afaict ... the release.js gets the essence of the git part but there is a lot more of course
[07:59:53] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i only really know the concept behind it
[08:00:14] <DaveMethvin> hmm, wonder who does know
[08:00:22] <danheberden> git version should be available on the cdn in a couple minutes
[08:00:30] <DaveMethvin> thanks danheberden
[08:00:36] <timmywil> danheberden: thanks!
[08:00:54] <danheberden> i'll try to make a little time to fix the script so it doesn't choke on conflicts
[08:01:02] <DaveMethvin> ok, let's think about schedule here for a minute
[08:02:01] <rwaldron> thanks danheberden!
[08:02:03] <rwaldron> <3
[08:02:03] <DaveMethvin> i'm going to be traveling on the west coast all next week
[08:02:28] <danheberden> haha, i like this - you guys work and toil all day to make jquery amazing
[08:02:38] <danheberden> i come in and fix a build script and get tons of praise!
[08:03:05] <DaveMethvin> shut up and take your compliment, sucka! :P
[08:03:44] <DaveMethvin> not having the -git build right is like having 0 really be 1
[08:03:52] <DaveMethvin> really messes up our assumptions
[08:04:00] <danheberden> haha
[08:04:17] <danheberden> that'll be a fun joke, when i have it pull the version and commit info
[08:04:21] <danheberden> but put in jquery 1.2.6
[08:04:39] <DaveMethvin> oooooh, don't even think about it!
[08:05:20] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: there we go http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/JxFtn/3/
[08:05:55] <DaveMethvin> last one still seems wrong tho?
[08:05:59] <DaveMethvin> Foobar?
[08:06:08] <timmywil> refresh
[08:06:20] <timmywil> should say undefined
[08:06:42] <DaveMethvin> IT"S A MIRACLE!
[08:07:02] <DaveMethvin> ok, so SCHEDULE :)
[08:08:27] <DaveMethvin> i'm down with the testswarm thang for 1.6.4, we just need to figure out who can get that done ... JohnResig?
[08:08:38] <timmywil> I think we need the jquery account
[08:09:05] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: what's this?
[08:09:20] <timmywil> JohnResig: we wanna testswarm
[08:09:22] <DaveMethvin> we wanted to run testswarm but don't know how
[08:09:25] <timmywil> but dunno how
[08:09:30] <timmywil> heh
[08:09:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah what he said
[08:09:58] <JohnResig> hmm, I thought the build script was running automatically?
[08:10:08] <DaveMethvin> oh maybe that one broke too
[08:10:13] <timmywil> woooops
[08:10:29] * timmywil lowers his head
[08:10:31] <DaveMethvin> where is THAT script?
[08:10:54] <DaveMethvin> perhaps we can sweet-talk danheberden again
[08:11:00] <DaveMethvin> he likes being the hero
[08:11:35] <danheberden> there is *a* build script for test-swarm now?
[08:11:43] <timmywil> JohnResig: we had a little hiccup on dave's first release.js run, had to fix some stuff on master, which caused conflicts
[08:11:51] <JohnResig> ugh
[08:12:22] <danheberden> JohnResig it needs to be udpated to fetch and reset to origin/master
[08:12:27] <danheberden> instead of just pulling
[08:12:48] <JohnResig> I don't remember where the script is - danheberden you probably have access to it
[08:12:52] <JohnResig> I think it's just a cron job
[08:13:00] <danheberden> yeah, it's already fixed re: the conflict
[08:13:05] <JohnResig> ah
[08:13:12] <danheberden> i'll try to fix it for future reverts later
[08:13:51] <timmywil> hopefully reverts will not be necessary again, but probably a good idea
[08:16:09] <timmywil> JohnResig: is it necessary that have the login for the jquery account on testswarm or can I see the summary page from my account
[08:16:35] <JohnResig> timmywil: anyone can see the summary page, you don't need to be logged in
[08:17:04] <timmywil> swarm.jquery.org?
[08:17:25] <JohnResig> yes? http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery/
[08:17:28] <JohnResig> anyone can see that page
[08:17:42] <timmywil> ah, that's the url i was looking for
[08:19:07] <timmywil> ok, but yea, that cron job needs reset
[08:19:40] <timmywil> danheberden: do you know where the script resides to update testswarm?
[08:19:53] <timmywil> we're trying to fix that one now
[08:20:10] <danheberden> it's on the bugs server, but i'm not very up on test-swarm or it's workings
[08:20:25] <danheberden> oh, i'm sorry
[08:20:27] <danheberden> not test swarm
[08:20:43] <danheberden> that's on a different box that i haven't been involved with at all
[08:20:50] <danheberden> (sry, had confused the qunit build :/ )
[08:20:55] <timmywil> ah
[08:20:56] <danheberden> heh, they're both j√∂rn!
[08:21:02] * danheberden is making excuses
[08:21:11] <timmywil> jzaefferer: pingaling
[08:23:12] <timmywil> ?tell jzaefferer the testswarm cron job has stopped due to merge conflicts
[08:23:13] <bot-t1> timmywil, Okay.
[08:24:20] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: we should probably release rc without testswarm
[08:31:38] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yeah kind of a tough choice ... if we do find bugs to fix in testswarm i guess we can have an rc2
[08:32:56] <DaveMethvin> let me get the blog post ready at least
[08:33:05] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: well, i just ran through all of our supported browsers except Opera 11.1
[08:35:24] <rwaldron> timmywil same, yesterday
[08:35:35] <timmywil> cool
[08:35:39] <rwaldron> accept including 11.10 & 11.5
[08:35:42] <rwaldron> 11.50
[08:35:54] <timmywil> even better
[10:33:10] <grzegorz> hello! Probably I found the problem with combination of dialog() and position() functions. Can I ask for advice?
[10:38:34] <grzegorz> hello! Probably I found the problem with combination of dialog() and position() functions. Can I ask for advice?
[10:53:22] <rwaldron> hey grzegorz, dialog() is the realm of jQuery UI
[10:53:47] <rwaldron> file bugs for them here: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/
[10:53:52] <rwaldron> thanks!
[10:54:12] <kborchers> rwaldron: yeah, i grabbed him in #jquery and asked him to reduce his test case so we can help
[10:54:32] <rwaldron> woooord
[10:54:36] <rwaldron> thanks kborchers
[12:00:33] <DaveMethvin> timmywil rwaldron JohnResig: so are you guys ok with a 1.6.4 rc1 today?
[12:01:01] <timmywil> yup
[12:04:01] <JohnResig> I may have missed this, what was the 1.6.4 for?
[12:06:10] <rwaldron> 2 critical 1.6.3 issues
[12:06:24] <rwaldron> that were missed because we did not have proper tests for them
[12:06:32] <rwaldron> well, 1 critical
[12:06:41] <JohnResig> rwaldron: which one was this?
[12:06:43] <rwaldron> the other fixed a symmetry issue
[12:06:51] <rwaldron> content-type xhtml/xml
[12:07:34] <rwaldron> we had reports that the change from <link/> to <link> in support.js was throwing exceptions
[12:07:51] <rwaldron> so it had to be restored.
[12:08:30] <DaveMethvin> here's the three bugs: http://bugs.jquery.com/query?milestone=1.6.4&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=component&order=priority
[12:08:32] <rwaldron> the other was just a dashed-to-camel fix for data attrs
[12:08:36] <rwaldron> thanks DaveMethvin
[12:10:58] <DaveMethvin> i can do the rc1 but will be on a plane on Monday so I'll miss the meeting .. i assume we'll want 1.6.4 monday assuming no problems
[12:12:03] <DaveMethvin> that puts us a bit late on landing 1.7 stuff but it seems important to get a stable 1.6.x out there since 1.7 will no doubt have teething pains
[13:14:42] <DaveMethvin> timmywil rwaldron JohnResig: i have to take off in about 10 minutes so I can't do an rc now ... can we come up with a plan for 1.6.4/1.7 early tomorrow or maybe later tonight?
[13:14:58] <rwaldron> yes
[13:15:11] <timmywil> i think we should get rc out today
[13:15:24] <timmywil> if possible
[13:19:13] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: it couldn't be me at this point ... I have a draft of the rc1 blog post ready but i'd be nervous about trying to rush the build/release process
[13:19:30] <DaveMethvin> it takes me much longer than 10 minutes to screw things up, ya know :P
[13:19:44] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: docs#9941
[13:19:46] <bot-t1> rwaldron, [#9941]  (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/9941
[13:19:53] <timmywil> np
[13:20:17] <timmywil> maybe JohnResig could do it?
[13:20:28] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yes?
[13:20:37] <DaveMethvin> well he definitely has more experience than me on that
[13:20:49] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron isn't that ticket a java problem?
[13:20:55] <rwaldron> probably
[13:20:58] <DaveMethvin> from the message the guy said he got
[13:21:03] <DaveMethvin> so i don't see how it's us
[13:21:03] <rwaldron> i dont know why i assigned it to myself
[13:21:06] <rwaldron> seems like a mistae
[13:21:07] <rwaldron> mistake
[13:21:19] <DaveMethvin> i'mma mark it pending
[13:21:32] <rwaldron> hm.
[13:21:38] <rwaldron> no its not Java
[13:21:47] <rwaldron> i think that the browser is implemented in Java
[13:21:52] <rwaldron> and likely is a piece of shit
[13:22:02] <rwaldron> that can't report decent errors
[13:22:33] <DaveMethvin> well we can't do much with the info we have
[13:22:43] <rwaldron> i think this is totally a case where a simple if(){ BAM } will cover it
[13:22:43] <DaveMethvin> and if Mobile hasn't bitched about it how bad can it be? :)
[13:22:55] <rwaldron> and there's that too
[13:24:08] <DaveMethvin> everything under 1.7 should be closed once I land the 1.7 event changes: http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=reopened&type=bug&component=event&group=milestone&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=owner&col=priority&col=milestone&col=version&report=1&order=milestone
[13:24:31] <DaveMethvin> I have my eye on one of the 1.next tickets as well
[13:24:52] <DaveMethvin> still need to go back and turn some fiddles into test cases for about 5 of them
[13:26:14] <DaveMethvin> ok gotta go, see you guys later
[15:56:34] <paul_irish> fwiwiw
[15:56:47] <paul_irish> doc.body always exists
[15:56:48] <paul_irish> http://www.phpied.com/files/bscope/autobody.html
[15:57:15] <paul_irish> assuming end of body is reached or a div/span/etc has been added to dom via markup or script
