[01:39:07] <joobie> hey guys.. anyone got a neat jquery stop watch timer example?
[01:50:58] <superchu> why would you need jquery to write a stop watch?
[03:40:40] <MacroMan> Hi all. I've written a prototype rotatable custom function for use the jquery rotate extension. This is similar is use to the draggable and resizables functions of jqueryui. Anyone know if there would be any future interest in making this part of jqueryui?
[03:41:25] <MacroMan> I'm planning to release it as a library anyway.
[05:01:02] <bj0rn_> What is the recommended way to use jquery with class-style javascript programming? (binding jquery events to methods of javascript class instances)
[05:01:38] <bj0rn_> sorry, I should be in #jquery.. nevermind me

[06:35:57] <rworth> DaveMethvin :)
[09:04:30] <DaveMethvin> sorry i am a bit late, meeting starting in #jquery-meeting now timmywil rwaldron sindresorhus

[10:03:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Why can't you use async deferreds for animations?
[10:03:40] <gnarf> because it kicks off the queue, and if you are animating a group of elements, you want them to all end in the same frame, and all start their next animation in the same frame too
[10:04:07] <gnarf> if it goes async, it becomes hell to track
[10:05:20] <gnarf> also, it adds an unknown delay between the end of one animation an the start of the next
[10:05:44] <gnarf> although
[10:05:50] <gnarf> if ...
[10:06:20] <gnarf> we were to make it such that any deferred that is "immediately resolved" can't actually "fire" until the next event loop
[10:06:26] <gnarf> instead of making all fires async
[10:06:51] <gnarf> i need .fire() and the callbacks in the same event loop
[10:07:35] <gnarf> the only case that would effect then is a duration 0... and I'm not so worried about those
[10:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: The ticket is not about the resolution itself happening asynchronously.
[10:08:45] <scott_gonzalez> It's that a deferred cannot be generated and resolved in the same event loop.
[10:09:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: then i misinterpret - although it still will "add delay" - and still has the issue with async:false (not that we should be supporting it anyway)
[10:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> it doesn't add delay, unless your try to resolve synchronously.
[10:09:50] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/appendto/amplify/blob/master/request/amplify.request.js#L17
[10:10:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sure - 0 delay animations would be created and resolved in the same frame
[10:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> well, that's stupid
[10:11:08] <gnarf> and currently, the behavior is to automatically start the next animation on that same frame
[10:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> Is that really an issue?
[10:11:42] <gnarf> probably not
[10:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> Actually IIRC .delay(0) is async.
[10:11:56] <gnarf> like i said, that case is not one that i particularly care about
[10:12:06] <gnarf> .delay(0) is
[10:12:11] <gnarf> but its implemented with a setTimeout
[10:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so you're fine with forced async, then?
[10:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously there's still sync xhr to deal with.
[10:13:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: for effects, yes
[10:13:18] <scott_gonzalez> Honestly, I could care less if we dropped deferreds support for sync xhr.
[10:13:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but then thats how the internals actually resolve it...
[11:01:30] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: can you please merge jqbug.com/p764
[11:01:45] <mikesherov> it's in my way for the boxModel removal stuff
[11:02:02] <mikesherov> http://jqbug.com/p764
[11:06:25] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i can land it now
[11:06:34] <mikesherov> great, thanks
[11:06:47] <mikesherov> just want that guy to get the credit he deserves!
[11:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Not sure if you know the answer to my questions off the top of your head: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11351#comment:4
[11:22:36] <eddiemonge> rwaldron: invalid?
[11:27:36] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to 1.8pre: http://git.io/IKs52g
[11:27:36] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.8pre] Fix #6724, though the Mobile Safari wound remains. Closes gh-764. - Matt Farmer
[11:28:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah i have to say that should have been closed "matteroftaste" perhaps eddiemonge ... it IS a big banner
[11:29:41] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: i was gonna say earlier... probably better places to report that than core bug tracker is all ;)
[11:29:48] <eddiemonge> DaveMethvin:  it really is. lol it pushes the fold way down
[11:30:07] <eddiemonge> ajpiano: like where? issues for the site design?
[11:30:31] <ajpiano> going forward for new sites it would be here
[11:30:39] <ajpiano> and for stuff like that now, getting in touch in IRC or whatnot makes  more sense
[11:30:41] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template
[11:30:51] <ajpiano> core bugs is pretty much for core bugs at this point
[11:30:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah, save the core bug tracker for important issues like "jquery doesn't handle floating point numbers correctly"
[11:31:09] <ajpiano> cause we're tracking docs here: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues
[11:31:39] <eddiemonge> its a weird "bug" since its not really docs and web-base isnt live yet
[11:32:21] <ajpiano> right that's why im sayin just social channels works better
[11:32:52] <ajpiano> realistically i donno if we're gonna get a chance to tweak it more, it'll be gone in a few weeks ;)
[11:34:03] <eddiemonge> can it at least get a close icon?
[11:34:52] <ajpiano> so instead of it just being a static thing in the markup we have to write javascript to support it?
[11:35:13] <ajpiano> i mean i know it's not that much :p
[11:36:08] <eddiemonge> inline even!
[11:36:49] <ajpiano> danheberden: what do you think
[11:39:51] <eddiemonge> nevermind i guess. not really important. ill stop making suggestions in the future :(
[11:40:01] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: cmon
[11:41:04] <DaveMethvin> eddiemonge: here's a bookmarklet for you:   javascript:$("#jq-content a:first-child").hide()
[11:41:27] <DaveMethvin> now stop pouting! :D
[11:41:31] <ajpiano> it's not a matter of not making suggestions... it's just like, is something feasible and useful vs how much time it takes to do it
[11:41:54] <ajpiano> cause for it to be any use at all then it has to localstorage the state of the banner etc etc
[11:42:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah a button or close icon complicates things a mite
[11:42:55] <DaveMethvin> where's that jenkins guy?
[11:42:59] <DaveMethvin> i should have failed by now
[11:43:03] <DaveMethvin> ?swarm
[11:43:09] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery 1.8 build #60: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%201.8/60/
[11:43:09] <jq-jenkins> dave.methvin: Fix #6724, though the Mobile Safari wound remains. Closes gh-764.
[11:52:20] <DaveMethvin> bot-t: where are thee?
[11:52:48] <danheberden> ajpiano i think it's a good point
[11:53:02] <danheberden> and i *think* we might have done that in the past
[11:53:28] <ajpiano> danheberden: i agree that it's a good point
[11:53:38] <ajpiano> but it's basically on you to implement it, that's why i punted :p
[11:53:53] <danheberden> oh snap!
[11:53:57] <danheberden> then i HATE THE IDEA lol
[11:54:32] <DaveMethvin> conceptually easy but a pain to actually do
[13:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> When is $.browser moving out of core? 1.8 or 1.9?
[15:40:17] <DaveMethvin> .
[15:41:59] <snover> .
[17:37:24] <mikesherov> OK, dumb question... probably dumbest of all time
[17:38:39] <mikesherov> isn't this: !(options.shivCSS === false)
[17:38:53] <mikesherov> the same thing as: options.shivCSS !== false
[17:39:05] <mikesherov> and isn't the second one clearer?
[18:14:55] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/778
[18:14:56] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (30.629s ago): fixes #11721, deprecate and remove internal uses of jQuery.support.boxModel
[18:16:03] <mikesherov> p.s. DaveMethvin, we deprecated jQuery.boxModel (in favor of jQuery.support.boxModel) in jQuery 1.3... is it safe for removal now?
[20:34:18] <Krinkle> mikeycgto: Yes, I personally consider !( ) moronic code, no offense, whatever that means
[20:35:03] <Krinkle> usually written by someone who doesn't know javascript very well, or copied it from someone like that
[20:35:39] <Krinkle> but when we're off guard, even the pros make stupid mistakes, of any kind
[20:39:03] <mikeycgto> i did not write any such programming codes!
[20:40:35] <Krinkle> I'm not saying you did, you asked a question
[20:40:41] <ajpiano> Krinkle: mikesherov did ;)
[20:40:41] <Krinkle> now I;m curious, where did you see that code?
[20:40:52] <Krinkle> ah, mike mike
[20:41:08] <mikeycgto> :D
[20:41:16] <Krinkle> I mentally substr() nicknames after the first few chars, didn;'t  notice
[20:41:23] <mikeycgto> heard my nick alert go off was like what the
[20:41:27] <mikeycgto> yeah np ;)
[20:41:31] <Krinkle> oh I DID try to tab further but it is no longer showing up
[20:41:40] <mikeycgto> lol
[20:41:40] <Krinkle> mikesherov left the channel
[20:41:44] <gf3> WHAT YOU SUGGESTED WAS BAD AND YOU SHOULD FEEL BAD, mikeycgto
[20:41:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah he just bailed
[20:41:58] <Krinkle> even worse
[20:42:11] <DaveMethvin> if bot-t was around i'd ask him to yell at mikeycgto
[20:42:28] <mikeycgto> :(
[20:42:28] <DaveMethvin> but of course he's not
[20:42:30] <Krinkle> mikeycgto: (yes you) actually joined right after mikesherov said the thing I replied to
[20:42:33] <gf3> DaveMethvin: We can have ircjsbot do it!
[20:42:42] <DaveMethvin> ircjsbot: yell at mikeycgto
[20:42:43] <gf3> ircjsbot: tell mikeycgto YOU'RE BAD
[20:42:43] <ircjsbot> gf3, OK, I will tell mikeycgto if I see them.
[20:42:55] <Krinkle> ircjsbot: UR BLIND!
[20:42:55] <ircjsbot> Krinkle, no UR BLIND!
[20:43:00] <Krinkle> oh shit
[20:43:01] <Krinkle> he's smart
[20:43:07] <gf3> :D
[20:43:09] <DaveMethvin> ok, tomorrow is "be nice to mikeycgto day"
[20:43:17] <DaveMethvin> expecially for Krinkle
[20:43:19] <mikeycgto> sweet, about time
[20:43:19] <ircjsbot> mikeycgto, you have one new message, from gf3 (36 seconds ago). Tell me if you want to read it (“read”).
