[07:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron, paul_irish_: Have you seen http://veged.github.com/krasota.js/
[07:40:58] <skylamer`> yes, scott_gonzalez, after you shared it xD
[07:41:09] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez looking
[07:41:42] <rwaldron> ooooo
[07:41:51] <rwaldron> 8D
[07:42:12] <skylamer`> if these tools can be 'easily' integradted into some editors, would be very cool, :)
[07:42:44] <skylamer`> now its also cool, from the clis
[07:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: I remember a thread somewhere about different tools to look into, but I don't remember where.
[07:46:05] <rwaldron> this is waaayyyy cool
[07:46:08] <rwaldron> :D
[07:46:15] <rwaldron> has jzaefferer seen?
[07:46:37] <ajpiano> zomg
[07:47:05] <ajpiano> i didn't even know that "protection" was a coding style ;)
[07:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> I showed him this morning.
[08:11:37] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez rwaldron: this thread? https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/issues/93
[08:11:37] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #93 on grunt (jzaefferer; 1m, 16h ago): JS styleguide validator
[08:12:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, thanks jzaefferer
[09:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: "hover is not a real event" made me think of "prepend is not a real word" :-)
[10:07:43] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez haha
[10:07:48] <rwaldron> ack brb
[12:41:29] <EliPerelman> Question about expected behavior on event binding. I know this is expected: http://jsfiddle.net/cXgjd/       But what about this: http://jsfiddle.net/MAG4e/     Or this: http://jsfiddle.net/zmGxd/
[12:47:16] <scott_gonzalez> Holy crap, Mozilla has way too many IRC channels.
[12:57:14] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: EliPerelman ^
[13:13:47] <timmywil> EliPerelman: it's been that way since 1.4.4. I'd say yes
[13:15:42] <EliPerelman> OK, expected. Is it planned to stay that way? I can't think of a case where you would want to bind several event types to the same element with the same function and event data, at least not in this manner
[13:16:21] <ajpiano> you can't?
[13:16:37] <EliPerelman> OK, I couldn't in five seconds, but maybe I could :)
[13:16:41] <ajpiano> $("#someTextInput").on("keyup change blur". fn)
[13:17:06] <EliPerelman> i mean the same event type  $("#someTextInput").on("click click click". fn)
[13:17:30] <ajpiano> would the suggestion you're making then be that we filter for dupes and only bind once?
[13:18:06] <EliPerelman> only dedup types after the split, other methods dont seem to make as much sense to change
[13:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> EliPerelman: I can't think of a case where you'd end up binding multiple times to the same event in one call :-P
[13:18:31] <ajpiano> i can't see why we'd want to actively filter out dupes
[13:18:39] <ajpiano> it's not like the behaviour is confusing as-is
[13:18:48] <ajpiano> it just lets you do something you don't actually need to
[13:19:18] <EliPerelman> I was just figuring a little proactive prevention. I understand the use-case is minute at best.
[13:19:25] <ajpiano> what is it preventing?
[13:20:48] <EliPerelman> I was thinking programmatic generation of event types, but maybe it is best to not make something behave unexpectedly
[13:21:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm -1 on changing the behavior.
[13:21:38] <ajpiano> EliPerelman: to *prevent* programmatic generation of event types?
[13:21:46] <ajpiano> yeah i'm -1 as well obviously
[13:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: To prevent incorrect programattic generation.
[13:22:01] <ajpiano> ah
[13:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> var types = [ "click" ]; type.push( "click" ); .on( type.join( " " ), fn )
[13:22:18] <ajpiano> yeah that is a pretty app-specific thing for us to guard against generically every single time anyone in the entire world binds any event ever
[13:23:04] <EliPerelman> Yeah, makes sense, I knew the case was tiny. Thanks for the direction :)
[13:23:22] <ajpiano> EliPerelman: thanks for asking here first instead of filing a ticket ;)
[13:23:34] <EliPerelman> Haha, any time :D
