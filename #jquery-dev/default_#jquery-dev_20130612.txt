[00:22:07] <JamesMGreene> G'night Krinkle
[07:17:01] <JamesMGreene> Good morning, Portland people :)
[07:17:08] <JamesMGreene> (and everyone else)
[07:31:55] <rworth> good morning
[07:32:22] <rworth> I'm headed over in a few min if anyone wants a ride
[07:43:47] <JamesMGreene> rworth: Do you know which side of the OCC do we enter? Looks pretty massive on GMaps
[07:44:14] <JamesMGreene> [if you haven't left already]
[07:45:00] <rworth> the room we're in is on the ground level in the front hall, between the Portland Ballroom (the round one with the slanted up corner) and the Oregon Ballroom (the one with the two glass spires on top)
[07:45:09] <rworth> so either of those front doors would work

[11:25:48] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle: Initial work for QUnit Node.js support is ready but I'm thinking I'll wait on merging Krinkle's latest PR

[12:35:07] <upperlow> hey, i was wondering if support for the "arraybuffer" response type in ajax requests is coming to jquery someday
[12:35:13] <upperlow> i found this closed ticket: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11461
[12:35:31] <upperlow> but now when ie 6-8 supported is dropped from jquery2, is the situation still the same?
[12:36:26] <upperlow> i don't know much about the actual work involved, i just stumbled upon this when doing some web audio api stuff today, where i loaded audio data from binary files
[12:36:49] <upperlow> and it turned out jquery ajax calls can't handle the "arraybuffer" response type necessary to do this
[12:37:08] <rwaldron> upperlow, the point of "doesn't break compatibility" is to ensure that code written for jQuery 1.x works the same as code written for jQuery 2.x and vice-versa
[12:37:09] <upperlow> so instead of reopening or commenting in the ticket, i thought i'd ask here
[12:39:09] <jqcommit> 01[13qunit01] 15Krinkle merged 06test-assertcontext into 06master: 02http://git.io/AHpRfg
[12:39:11] <upperlow> rwaldron: can it be concluded that support for arraybuffer can't be added without breaking support?
[12:39:23] <upperlow> without breaking backwards comp that is
[12:39:56] <rwaldron> correct
[12:39:58] <upperlow> it just seems like at least an open ticket on this should exist, no?
[12:40:06] <rwaldron> that doesnt mean you can;t make an ajax plugi
[12:40:08] <rwaldron> plugin*

[12:40:20] <doesallmagic2> Timo Tijhof: test: Migrate to using assert context
[12:41:05] <upperlow> rwaldron: so maybe that's what i should be looking for then, or write :)
[12:41:34] <rwaldron> yes
[12:41:36] <rwaldron> +1
[12:41:40] <rwaldron> be proactive
[12:41:41] <rwaldron> :)
[12:42:52] <upperlow> rwaldron: when saying "ajax plugin" does that mean i can write a plugin for jquery to add this functionality?
[12:43:13] <upperlow> rwaldron: and if so, any pointers on where i should start? e.g. plugin writers guide etc.
[12:45:15] <JamesMGreene> upperlow: I'm guessing rwaldron means utilizing the ajaxTransport and/or ajaxPrefilter hooks

[14:42:37] <rwaldron> timmywil: you just reopened http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13768 and assigned to yourself
[14:43:08] <rwaldron> I was wondering if you had the npm credentials
[14:43:11] <rwaldron> or if you needed them
[14:43:45] <timmywil> I do need them :)
[14:44:01] <timmywil> but are you wanting to take it?

[14:50:44] <rwaldron> timmywil no i dont want to
[14:50:53] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin should have those credentials in an email
[14:51:19] <timmywil> rwaldron: ok thanks man!
[14:51:55] <jaubourg> what is this doc you shared DaveMethvin
[14:51:57] <jaubourg> ?
[14:52:46] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BpRMmuxswoAuvp8x3uvSp5IiG3bWLoNkZ7mnILWT3Kg/edit
[14:58:49] <rwaldron> timmywil i just sent the npm credentials to you
[14:58:56] <rwaldron> thats for the node-jquery thing
[14:59:01] <rwaldron> i think?
[14:59:05] <rwaldron> something like that
[14:59:48] <timmywil> ha, love the passw
[15:12:25] <rwaldron> timmywil: <3 ;)
[15:12:56] <snover> DaveMethvin: i can probably find time to update grunt builds if thereâ€™s a commitment
[15:19:07] <DaveMethvin> we are feeling warmer and fuzzier about it snover

[15:58:42] <DaveMethvin> snover so we're all good with switching to AMD for modules ... just a concern about sizes but we won't know the exact cost until it's built. I can't imagine it takes that much more space though

[22:00:32] <JamesMGreene> Anyone at jQCon want to help me hack on grunt-lib-phantomjs to make it use WebSockets instead of file I/O for the Node-PhantomJS IPC?
[22:06:52] <JamesMGreene> Soooooo... I just created a new public GH repo but it's showing up as private (and don't even have a plan that supports private repos). Anyone else seeing this?
[22:08:42] <snover> how can i see if it is private?!?
[22:08:50] <snover> paradox!
[22:10:21] <JamesMGreene> har har
[22:10:33] <JamesMGreene> I meant if you create a new public repo, does it show up as private?
[22:10:44] <JamesMGreene> You know, assuming you're a cheapo with only a free plan like me
[22:11:09] <snover> that is too much effort, yo.
[22:11:37] <snover> i bet you just got drunk and gave them your CC#
[22:12:17] <JamesMGreene> Nah, I restrained myself to a measly 2 drinks tonight
[22:12:52] <JamesMGreene> So why didn't you come out to Portland, snover?
[22:15:49] <snover> so awkward
[22:35:49] <JamesMGreene> snover: ...? <3
[22:37:38] <snover> sooo awkward
[22:37:41] <snover> DaveMethvin can verify
[22:47:11] <JamesMGreene> !? You're from Minneapolis?
[22:47:26] <JamesMGreene> Have we met?  o_O
[22:52:52] <snover> no
[22:53:00] <snover> i mean probably not
[22:53:31] <JamesMGreene> Not a JSMN attendee?
[22:54:18] <snover> no
[22:58:40] <JamesMGreene> I see
[22:59:07] <JamesMGreene> Well, you should come out to JSMN some time :)
[22:59:25] <JamesMGreene> http://meetup.com/JavaScriptMN/
[23:02:14] <snover> oh but iâ€™m not really interested in listening to or interacting with other people
[23:03:40] <JamesMGreene> What do you consider IRC?
[23:03:47] <JamesMGreene> For the record, I am not a robot
[23:08:11] <snover> youâ€™re just words on a screen
[23:08:17] <snover> far away words with really low ping times
[23:15:16] <JamesMGreene> So you didn't come to Portland because you hate people. Got it.  :-P
