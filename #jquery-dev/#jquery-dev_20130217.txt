[13:52:54] <guy> Why do I get a syntax error here? $($('script[data-name="table"]').html()); where script is https://gist.github.com/gajus/4e3694a7b269d729232f
[13:52:58] <guy> $('script[data-name="table"]').html() returns HTML as plain text, then $() should convert it to jQuery object.
[13:53:22] <guy> I am pretty sure this used to work with 1.8 jQuery. Did I miss any breaking changes or is this a bug?
[13:57:28] <DaveMethvin> guy when you used the jquery-migrate plugin did it give you a warning?
[13:57:38] <DaveMethvin> sounds like it should have
[13:57:48] <DaveMethvin> and when you looked it up it would be this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/warnings.md#jqmigrate-html-html-strings-must-start-with--character
[13:57:51] <guy> DaveMethvin: it is not something that migrate plugin could have detected.
[13:58:16] <DaveMethvin> orly?
[13:58:26] <DaveMethvin> do me a favor and give it a try
[13:58:27] <guy> uh. I guess I am wrong.
[13:58:56] <guy> That's pretty awesome. Someone did a really delicate job then.

[20:48:04] <JamesMGreene> Good evening
[20:49:51] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer I'm so terribly compelled to break QUnit Composite and JUnitLogger out into repos now, given that it sounds like the strategy moving forward anyway :)
[20:52:12] <JamesMGreene> But I don't want to be that guy who isn't a team player
[20:52:17] <JamesMGreene> Meh :-|
[22:14:56] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer gnarf gibson042 scott_gonzalez Krinkle|detached So being that I'm not a QUnit collaborator [yet], if I wanted to go about and create the separate repos for the existing QUnit bundled addons, would that be OK? i.e. I duplicate (https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository) -- not fork -- the QUnit repo once for each addon, trim down each repo to just that addon, and 
[22:14:56] <JamesMGreene> then allow the jQuery organization to take ownership of them...?
[22:32:18] <JamesMGreene> (Since, you know, you can't submit a PR to create a new repo =))
