[00:12:54] <JamesMGreene> Any Linux users around?
[06:00:52] <_|Nix|_> JamesMGreene: I am a Linux user. What's up?
[06:02:20] <_|Nix|_> Is it intentional that var x = $( "<div style='width: 150px; height: 150px; background: red;'></div>" ).appendTo( "body" ).addClass( "abc" ).removeClass( "abc" ); leaves x with a class attribute that is set to an empty string? Shouldn't the class attribute be removed when it becomes empty?
[06:05:02] <_|Nix|_> Otherwise, it's impossible to cleanly implement a destroy for a widget factory-based widget, because whenever I attach a class to this.element, upon _destroy() I have to not only remove that class, but also check if the removal has caused the class attribute to become "", because addClass will instantiate the class attribute, but removeClass will not remove it.

[06:09:03] <m_gol> _|Nix|_: you can't prevent in a sensible way
[06:09:31] <m_gol> _|Nix|_: in the future we'll switch to classList and classList.remove('sth') doesn't remove the attribute AFAIK
[06:09:37] <m_gol> _|Nix|_: so better not to rely on it
[06:10:02] <m_gol> though I'm not sure about the spec, it's in flux at the moment
[06:18:17] <_|Nix|_> m_gol: *sigh* ... I guess I'll have to relax my unit tests to accept "" as equivalent to null or undefined ...
[06:18:43] <_|Nix|_> m_gol: Feel free to close http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13950 ...
[06:40:26] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Are you aware of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/testsuite.js#L186 ?
[06:41:58] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Sweet! I could actually use that ...
[06:45:22] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... it looks like that file does more than just define window.TestHelpers ... is it possible to separate out the definition of window.TestHelpers from the rest of the file? That way, we might unify it withe jQM's $.testHelper ...
[06:51:16] <scott_gonzalez> The test helpers are pretty tightly integrated with UI right now.
[06:51:52] <scott_gonzalez> For example, TestHelpers.testJshint needs to know where the jshintrc file is and which source files to to load.
[06:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably pull out things like the common widget tests and domEqual.
[06:57:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I suppose I can copy domEqual to $.testHelper for now. I can make devtask issue about integrating it back with TestHelpers eventually.
