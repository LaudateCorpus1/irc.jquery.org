[09:15:22] <DaveMethvin> anyone who wants to be in the core meeting, we're holding the chat in the google doc
[09:15:23] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1su2ZTFZbnp_DD-LGZleuEudTFRJT_g4zf7UfGOMQvco/edit
[09:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: What's the difference between 1.x Backcompatiphilia and Status Quo 1.x?
[09:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand "Add keys as given"
[09:57:05] <DaveMethvin> in the meeting still
[09:57:30] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:04:17] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: when you .data(obj) we currently just extend() the keys from obj into the current data object
[10:04:17] <DaveMethvin> but if we are going to be "consistent"
[10:04:17] <DaveMethvin> we might camelize them
[10:04:17] <DaveMethvin> but i feel like the user knows best
[10:04:17] <DaveMethvin> and backcompat,e tc
[10:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> But what's the difference between the two?
[10:05:15] <DaveMethvin> oh probably none
[10:05:25] <DaveMethvin> 2.x is setting BOTH camel and hyphen
[10:05:30] <DaveMethvin> so it's not 1.x compat :)
[10:05:40] <scott_gonzalez> So the Backcompatiphilia line can be removed?
[10:06:10] <DaveMethvin> i think it's the same, yes, but gibson042 had made up the list so i left it in
[10:06:22] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: ^
[10:45:25] <snover> DaveMethvin: iâ€™m so sorry.
[10:56:09] <gibson042> scott_gonzalez: 1.x backcompatiphilia is the same as status quo 1.x
[10:56:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so let's remove it.
[10:56:32] <gibson042> DaveMethvin added the status quo lines and apparently didn't like my fancy talk
[14:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> "...it should be up to the developer whether or not to piss off users..." :-P https://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=24790#c0
[14:49:47] <scott_gonzalez> Where can I hire this guy?
[14:51:45] <DaveMethvin> good luck with that dude ... this is basically the same uproar we had from deprecate sync xhr a couple of years ago
