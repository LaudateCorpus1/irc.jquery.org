[07:56:58] <DaveMethvin> .
[07:56:59] <bot-t> (19 hours 10 mins ago) <rwaldron> tell DaveMethvin early draft of stripped IIFEs https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/strip_iife
[07:57:16] <DaveMethvin> uh, bot-t, you're late
[07:57:34] <scott_gonzalez> bot-t is late? Will there be little bots running around soon?
[07:57:52] <DaveMethvin> baby bots are SOOO cute
[07:58:49] <DaveMethvin> so scott_gonzalez, i meant to ask you about the continuing saga of my struggle with wordpress
[07:59:01] <DaveMethvin> i copied over the base template but there must be more than that
[07:59:13] <DaveMethvin> do i need to set some wordpress settings somewhere?
[07:59:19] <DaveMethvin> it's not seeing the template
[07:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> In admin, Appearance -> Themes
[08:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> Activate the appropriate theme (they're named based on URL).
[08:03:00] <DaveMethvin> okay, right after this meeting
[08:03:42] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin: i'm working on this PR for $
[08:03:49] <ben_alman> it's been a long time
[08:03:54] <ben_alman> am i using grunt to build stuff?
[08:04:00] <DaveMethvin> i hope so!
[08:04:06] <ben_alman> and am i working against master?
[08:04:12] <DaveMethvin> yep
[08:04:17] <DaveMethvin> maybe you can update the readme :P
[08:04:26] <ben_alman> yeah, i don't see this in the readme
[08:05:32] <ben_alman> so once i run grunt, i test by doing what?
[08:05:52] <DaveMethvin> running the unit tests
[08:05:56] <ben_alman> opening do i open test/index.html in a browser?
[08:06:01] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I set up WordPress web-base-template + api.jquery.com locally over the weekend. if you want help with that, let me know.
[08:06:09] <ben_alman> wait. i need a localhost web server, right?
[08:06:13] <DaveMethvin> right
[08:06:24] <ben_alman> is there one that comes built-in?
[08:06:34] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: nope, byo
[08:06:38] <ben_alman> ah
[08:06:44] <ben_alman> hmmn
[08:06:54] <DaveMethvin> we've discussed a switch but there are pros/cons
[08:06:56] <ben_alman> i don't have the time to set up a dev environment just to run unit tests
[08:07:09] <ben_alman> this is dom stuff
[08:07:13] <ben_alman> it should work from file:// right?
[08:07:31] <DaveMethvin> nope
[08:07:33] <ben_alman> i just want to make the PR and wash my hands of it, but i need a quick path to getting this done
[08:07:35] <ben_alman> really?
[08:07:41] <DaveMethvin> not ajax
[08:07:46] <ben_alman> no it's just DOM
[08:07:50] <ben_alman> i'm doing the .addBack thing
[08:08:05] <DaveMethvin> send a pr and i won't yell at you
[08:08:13] <DaveMethvin> sorry got a call
[08:08:18] <ben_alman> well i need to write and test the unit tests
[08:09:17] <ben_alman> i think i can just do file://localhost/Volumes/Data/Dropbox/Projects/Repos/cowboy/forks/jquery/test/index.html?filter=addBack
[08:09:23] <ben_alman> i mean, i hope that works
[08:09:53] <timmywil> ben_alman: it used to, there was talk of prohibiting that, against my strong objections
[08:10:36] <ben_alman> ok, well all i know is that if i have to build a dev environment just to contribute unit tests alongside code to jquery, i'm not likely to do that
[08:10:50] <ben_alman> so i want to grease the wheels here
[08:11:15] <ben_alman> my goal is to very rapidly contribute code + tests and be sure they work here
[08:11:18] <ben_alman> non-ajax
[08:11:26] <timmywil> agreed
[08:11:34] <ben_alman> i can understand this being extra work for anyone brave enough to work on ajax stuff
[08:11:55] <timmywil> ben_alman: ah, it works
[08:12:05] <ben_alman> what is "q" in the unit tests?
[08:12:07] <timmywil> looks like there was just a test added in core for test environment
[08:12:10] <ben_alman> i don't see it defined locally
[08:12:16] <timmywil> testinit.js
[08:12:27] <timmywil> it is used to create an array of elements selected by id
[08:12:33] <timmywil> for selection comparisons
[08:12:42] <ben_alman> ok
[08:12:47] <ben_alman> gotcha
[08:13:01] <ben_alman> this should be documented!
[08:13:04] <ben_alman> but thanks
[08:13:19] <timmywil> good point
[08:13:37] <ben_alman> i'm just thinking of all the stuff i'm having to do to contribute 3 lines of code
[08:13:45] <ben_alman> and most of it is guesswork atm
[08:13:48] <ben_alman> and this is ME
[08:13:52] <ben_alman> imagine joe schmoe contributor
[08:14:40] <timmywil> many things need to be documented before 1.8 is released
[08:14:59] <timmywil> it seems we're currently in a major transition period
[08:16:01] <timmywil> but you bring up a good point about documenting testinit
[08:17:06] <ben_alman> maybe not a bad idea to add some comments @ the top of each test .js file
[08:17:11] <ben_alman> with convenient info
[08:17:14] <ben_alman> i do this with grunt
[08:17:33] <ben_alman> https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/tasks/init/jquery/root/test/name_test.js
[08:17:35] <ben_alman> see the comments
[08:17:41] <ben_alman> useful stuff for anyone, really
[08:17:59] <ben_alman> but even just a link to where it's documented would be awesome
[08:18:07] <ben_alman> at the top of every unit test file
[08:18:38] <timmywil> actually I'd prefer that nice little guide. QUnit docs are :(
[08:18:44] <ben_alman> heh
[08:37:50] <jqcommit> [jquery] rwldrn pushed 2 new commits to strip_iife: http://git.io/X_XiXA
[08:37:50] <jqcommit> [jquery/strip_iife] More grunt task migration; Removes duplicate functionality from make - Rick Waldron
[08:37:50] <jqcommit> [jquery/strip_iife] Update README to include instructions for using grunt - Rick Waldron
[08:38:41] <timmywil> ben_alman: actually, mind if I just go ahead and use that guide?
[08:38:46] <ben_alman> please
[08:38:52] <ben_alman> but that's just qunit stuff
[08:38:59] <ben_alman> there's a ton of jquery specifics that need to be documented
[08:39:05] <timmywil> sure
[08:39:07] <ben_alman> ok
[08:40:11] <ben_alman> is this intentional?
[08:40:20] <ben_alman> jQuery("body").prevObject // document
[08:40:28] <ben_alman> well, a jQuery object containing document
[08:40:44] <timmywil> it is
[08:41:05] <ben_alman> so jQuery("body").addBack() will return an object with both the body and document selected
[08:41:11] <ben_alman> that is intentional?
[08:41:38] <ben_alman> just want to make sure
[08:41:45] <ben_alman> i've come across it in writing my unit tests
[08:41:51] <timmywil> makes sense to me, but maybe that's only because I know that jQuery objects use pushStack on creation
[08:41:59] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11797 -- I could actually support a "start" - "finish" etc callbacks pretty easily
[08:42:01] <ben_alman> i never knew that
[08:42:10] <gnarf> prolly not too many bytes either
[08:42:11] <ben_alman> is using pushstack on creation a new thing?>
[08:42:18] <timmywil> always done that
[08:42:27] <timmywil> hence rootjQuery
[08:42:47] <timmywil> jQuery("body") === rootjQuery.find("body")
[08:43:05] <ben_alman> in jquery 1.7.2, jQuery("body").prevObject // undefined
[08:43:19] <timmywil> oh yea?
[08:43:24] <ben_alman> in the current master, jQuery("body").prevObject // a jquery object with document selected
[08:43:32] <ben_alman> so .end() will be different
[08:43:37] <ben_alman> than it always has
[08:43:38] <ben_alman> always
[08:43:42] <ben_alman> *always*
[08:43:55] <ben_alman> jQuery("something").end() now behaves differently
[08:44:07] <timmywil> wait, this is different?
[08:44:26] <ben_alman> do jQuery("body").end() on api.jquery com
[08:44:33] <ben_alman> and then do it with the current github master
[08:45:14] <timmywil> interesting
[08:45:24] <ben_alman> i'll file an issue
[08:46:07] <timmywil> ben_alman: jQuery 1.2.6 returns document
[08:46:38] <timmywil> and 1.3.2
[08:47:06] <ben_alman> was 1.7.2 brokens?
[08:47:37] <timmywil> stopped at 1.4.4
[08:47:46] <ben_alman> ok yeah
[08:47:49] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: ben_alman: jQuery("body") was optimized in .init() to game the taskspeed benchmark, i removed that recently and that probalby fixed master
[08:47:52] <ben_alman> so for a long time the behavior has been different
[08:48:12] <timmywil> ahhhhh, right, it was optimized and skipped pushstack
[08:48:27] <ben_alman> oh weird
[08:48:37] <ben_alman> so .end() on body is different than many other things
[08:48:50] <ben_alman> should i file an issue?
[08:48:57] <ben_alman> if you don't care i won't
[08:49:02] <DaveMethvin> why? it's not documented
[08:49:08] <timmywil> I think the current master behavior is correct
[08:49:19] <timmywil> although, ID is wrong
[08:49:31] <timmywil> and $('<tag>')
[08:49:31] <ben_alman> timmywil: if so maybe there should be a unit test asserting that it is correct
[08:49:48] <ben_alman> i like the idea of the first selection ending to document
[08:49:54] <ben_alman> well
[08:50:00] <ben_alman> sec
[08:50:40] <timmywil> I mean, it's low priority, but consistency isn't out of the question
[08:51:12] <ben_alman> well i do like the idea of any initial context-based selection .end()ing on the context element
[08:51:29] <ben_alman> whcih is what it seems to do now
[08:51:44] <ben_alman> jQuery("div", document.body).end() // [<body id=​"body">​…​</body>​]
[08:51:56] <ben_alman> it feels intuitive-ish
[08:52:13] <ben_alman> except that you don't know, if you cared, that you were at the initial jquery object
[08:52:21] <ben_alman> since it no longer has a .prevObject of undefined
[08:52:22] <ben_alman> no matter
[08:52:31] <ben_alman> if nobody complains, it's perfect
[08:54:40] <timmywil> yes, I've only ever seen .end() used in chaining while traversing
[08:54:51] <DaveMethvin> prevObject isn't a public interface, and documenting it this way means we have to pushStack on #id
[08:55:29] <timmywil> I'm not sure he's saying we should document prevObject
[08:55:55] <ben_alman> yeah i'm just talking about .end()
[08:56:01] <ben_alman> just want to make sure it behaves consistently
[08:56:42] <ben_alman> ok PR submitted for 9800
[08:56:56] <timmywil> thanks ben_alman
[08:57:00] <ben_alman> np
[09:00:48] <DaveMethvin> on the docs angle, i still don't think we have any that explain which methods use pushStack and thus can be counterbalanced by .end()
[09:01:47] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking we could do it via the "Returns" and just have "current jQuery" and "new jQuery" or something like that, with an explanation in Types about the differnce
[09:02:20] <ben_alman> sounds reasonable
[09:02:56] <timmywil> somewhere I've seen docs about using pushStack in plugins which had a pretty good explanation of how it works. Maybe it was on the learning site.
[09:03:19] <kswedberg> timmywil: http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/12/using-jquerys-pushstack-for-reusable-dom-traversing-methods ?
[09:03:31] <timmywil> karl to the rescue
[09:03:32] <ben_alman> i cover pushStack in my plugins talk
[09:04:07] <kswedberg> :)

[09:45:29] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by timmywil (4m, 3s ago): Add quick-guide documentation for testing with QUnit and using jQuery's helper methods.
[09:46:43] <DaveMethvin> well i'm all for documentation
[09:46:44] <DaveMethvin> well i'm all for documentation
[09:46:46] <DaveMethvin> well i'm all for documentation
[09:47:22] <timmywil> you ok with having this little snippet in all of our test files?
[09:47:27] <DaveMethvin> seems strange to have that header in every file
[09:47:33] <timmywil> yea see
[09:47:36] <DaveMethvin> but i'm not sure where to put it that people would read it
[09:47:55] <DaveMethvin> perhaps in one place with a link in the README?
[09:48:15] <timmywil> it's probably most helpful to have it in each one, but I hear the argument that changes are annoying
[09:48:39] <DaveMethvin>  i've had the problem of finding the docs for the qunit stuff before so i know where you are coming from
[09:48:48] <DaveMethvin> it's the same with the whole build process and grunt
[09:49:14] <DaveMethvin> like, the grunt pages assume you are on a desert island and want to write a gruntfile
[09:49:24] <DaveMethvin> but for our project most ppl won't touch the build process at all
[09:49:29] <DaveMethvin> except to build :P
[09:49:32] <timmywil> hey, I'm actually using grunt now. I just never knew it was ready.
[09:49:49] <DaveMethvin> because the readme never got updated :D
[09:49:58] <timmywil> true nuff
[09:51:02] <DaveMethvin> i like those actual docs though timmywil, nice and short but a great explain of the tests we have
[09:51:16] <danheberden> a very great explain
[09:51:19] <timmywil> ok, but you'd prefer one file
[09:51:23] <DaveMethvin> so if they were just in one place i'd be happy yeah
[09:51:24] <timmywil> lol
[09:51:31] <timmywil> kk
[09:51:37] <timmywil> I guess I do too
[09:51:42] <DaveMethvin> y u fun my english danheberden
[09:52:01] <danheberden> dissapoint
[09:52:04] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil did you ship  your product?
[09:52:05] <danheberden> disssssapoint
[09:52:15] <DaveMethvin> can you take my order?
[09:52:18] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: we're submitting to the app store this week
[09:52:28] <timmywil> I'm excited
[09:52:51] <timmywil> things are a little less hectic now tho, which makes me :)
[09:53:13] <DaveMethvin> glad to have you back around for a while!
[09:53:25] <DaveMethvin> sizzle is sizzling again
[09:53:31] * timmywil shucks
[09:54:27] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: what you think of the revisions and stuff? Lots of tickets got closed. :)
[09:54:28] <DaveMethvin> so kswedberg  you said you'd gotten api.jquery.com set up ... how can I help?
[09:54:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw
[09:54:36] <DaveMethvin> looked good
[09:54:48] <DaveMethvin> haven't looked in detail
[09:54:55] <DaveMethvin> wondered about matchesSelector though
[09:55:17] <timmywil> yea, native matchesSelector really isn't worth it
[09:55:26] <DaveMethvin> really, that bad?
[09:55:44] <DaveMethvin> kinda sad, they have all that native code and they screw it up
[09:56:07] <timmywil> it's not that its buggy, it's that its too broad
[09:57:22] <DaveMethvin> well just about every time I've needed it, it's been for a non-hierarchical use which isnt' too bad in js anyway
[09:57:23] <timmywil> for instance, when we match ('#elem selector'), we use getElementById (if we can) for the context
[09:57:41] <timmywil> but according to the spec, more than one element can actually have the same id
[09:57:48] <timmywil> so matchesSelector will check *
[09:58:00] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, which is why querySelectorAll is slower than gEBTN i guess
[09:58:07] <timmywil> right
[09:58:28] <DaveMethvin> stupid spec
[09:59:06] <timmywil> but there are bugs, and adding tests for when matchesSelector would fail would also be a pain
[09:59:49] <DaveMethvin> i wish we had a decent code search for public projects, it would be interesting to see what people do with .is()
[09:59:50] <timmywil> also, this opens the door for a similar caching system to quickIs
[09:59:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:00:53] <timmywil> also, we're not the only selector engine to come to this conclusion
[10:01:26] <DaveMethvin> seems like some of this is tied to the dumb spec, and dumb specs are hard to change
[10:01:33] <DaveMethvin> if it was just a slow impl it would be different
[10:01:46] <snover> search everything and then filter, duh, so obvious, why would anyone not implement it this way
[10:02:00] <snover> —w3c on selectors api
[10:02:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah, just to be sure YOU GOT EVERYTHING
[10:04:24] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: should I just add these docs to the README?
[10:04:36] <DaveMethvin> i wouldn't object to that
[10:04:45] <DaveMethvin> we can always move them elsewehre later
[10:07:34] <timmywil> I think I'll leave it in sizzle's selector.js tho if that's cool with you. That's where q and t are used most anyway.
[10:07:58] <DaveMethvin> sure
[10:08:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah i don't use q and t much
[10:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> api.jquery.com doesn't mention that .fadeIn( object ) works (or any other animation method).
[10:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> Is that intentional or just an oversight?
[10:26:25] <sizcommit> [sizzle] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/rpxG5Q
[10:26:25] <sizcommit> [sizzle/master] Add quick-guide documentation for testing with QUnit and using jQuery's helper methods. - timmywil
[10:26:42] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/pxPXBA
[10:26:42] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Add quick-start documentation for testing with QUnit and using jQuery's helper methods. - timmywil
[10:26:42] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Update README to stylize docs on jQuery's test suite methods - timmywil
[10:26:58] <timmywil> sorry about the two commits
[10:27:07] <timmywil> updating README's on github is too nice
[10:29:00] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ^
[10:45:02] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: yeah, that's a glaring omission.
[10:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Do you want a ticket for it?
[10:47:10] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: please! https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/new
[10:47:52] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: want me to help get you set up locally for api.jquery.com?
[10:48:07] <DaveMethvin> however i can  help you kswedberg
[10:48:26] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: are you being a smartass or did you misunderstand? :)
[10:48:43] <DaveMethvin> no, honest!
[10:48:54] <DaveMethvin> this started about a week ago
[10:49:06] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to help get these sites up by the conf
[10:49:12] <kswedberg> ah, I see!
[10:49:12] <DaveMethvin> but it's taken me a week (on and off)
[10:49:13] <kswedberg> ok.
[10:49:21] <DaveMethvin> so i think i have everything set up now
[10:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/32
[10:49:30] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #32 on api.jquery.com (scottgonzalez; 0.759s ago): .show(), .fadeIn(), etc. missing object signature
[10:49:37] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: you got it running locally?
[10:49:43] <DaveMethvin> well i THINK so
[10:49:44] <kswedberg> thx, scott_gonzalez
[10:49:46] <kswedberg> cool.
[10:49:54] <DaveMethvin> and ... now what?
[10:50:06] <DaveMethvin> honestly i forgot what needs to be done now
[10:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: FYI nacin is working on automating the whole setup right now.
[10:50:39] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: Oh sure! after DaveMethvin goes through torture!
[10:50:44] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:50:56] <DaveMethvin> see there's a bright side to everything :D
[10:51:15] <DaveMethvin> well plus i'm on windows to make it gold-leaf-cluster hard
[10:51:33] <kswedberg> :)
[10:52:00] <DaveMethvin> so what useful work can I do to help now that I have this set up?
[10:52:32] <DaveMethvin> is there a task list somewhere?
[10:53:19] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: scott_gonzalez and Richard probably have a better idea of what the priorities are for getting the sites up by conf time

[10:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You were going to work on updating the HTML/CSS, right?
[10:54:53] <DaveMethvin> well i hoped there were some more specific instructions :D
[10:55:00] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Sure. jzaefferer or rworth might have some feedback about that.
[10:55:09] <kswedberg> ok.

[11:10:20] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by timmywil (1d, 59m ago): Update Sizzle: independent XML testing
[11:10:23] <Krinkle> started with the sizzle update
[11:10:37] <Krinkle> Made all this: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/165
[11:10:41] <Krinkle> all the same error
[11:10:47] <timmywil> already fixed
[11:11:06] <Krinkle> TestSwarm doesn't agree :P It is still living in pain, in the past.
[11:11:15] <DaveMethvin> does it do a submodule update?
[11:11:50] <timmywil> 165 is a pretty old job
[11:11:53] <Krinkle> dunno, but I don't doubt it being fixed. what I meant is, testswarm is still busy testing those old revs
[11:11:57] <DaveMethvin> job 180 seems to be stalled
[11:12:06] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/180
[11:12:15] <Krinkle> browserstack is stalled
[11:12:23] <Krinkle> it has been up/down randomly over the past 3 weeks
[11:12:26] <Krinkle> no idea what is to balem
[11:12:31] <Krinkle> sometimes it is down for hours
[11:12:33] <DaveMethvin> blame even
[11:12:42] <timmywil> I know the contains problem is fixed
[11:12:42] <Krinkle> practically at least, whether it actually is down I don't know
[11:12:51] <DaveMethvin> i hope they're not running out of venture capital
[11:12:51] <Krinkle> but I do know no browsers are online
[11:12:56] <Krinkle> hehe
[11:13:29] <DaveMethvin> going back to a ragtag group of random internets computers would be even worser
[11:15:20] <timmywil> Krinkle: sry, took me a second to realize what you were saying
[11:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: That diff is hard to read with all the whitespace that got fixed :-P
[11:31:05] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like tacking on ?w doesn't work...
[11:31:17] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I know. sorry! :/ didn't realize it until after I sent the pull request.
[11:31:21] <scott_gonzalez> There are other sites that use pretty-printing too.
[11:31:35] <kswedberg> should we just load it on all, then?
[11:32:06] <kswedberg> I thought it was at least a step in the right direction, getting it set up so we could massage it later
[11:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's probably fine, but I'd just want to run it past jzaefferer or rworth.
[11:33:16] <scott_gonzalez> They've been working on code highlighting for qunitjs.com
[11:33:29] <kswedberg> ah. okay.
[11:33:34] <scott_gonzalez> I think they wanted to do the markup adjustments on the server.
[11:33:57] <scott_gonzalez> So that it was just CSS in the theme.
[11:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> Seems reasonable now that we're processing all content before publishing anyway.
[11:34:22] <kswedberg> sure
[11:35:27] <scott_gonzalez> I added a comment on the PR.

[12:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> I assume that's inside TestSwarm?
[12:47:15] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Yes it is a testswarm error
[12:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> Problem connecting to the db?
[12:47:23] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: but I'd need to know where it happens for it to be useful
[12:47:37] <Krinkle> e.g. on the generation of the run page, or in the ajax request for getrun.
[12:47:50] <Krinkle> The former would be a real problem, the latter is self-solving with re-try
[12:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> I assume if you try to connect to TestSwarm you'll see it.
[12:47:58] <Krinkle> Lets find out
[12:48:01] <Krinkle> h/o
[12:49:07] <Krinkle> Run page itself works fine (http://swarm.jquery.org/run/<...>), trying with run_token now
[12:49:16] <Krinkle> ..which appears to be timing out
[12:50:35] <scott_gonzalez> So our workers connect, TestSwarm dies, then our workers hang out for a while doing nothing?
[12:50:40] <scott_gonzalez> Is that what's happening?
[12:50:47] <Krinkle> maybe
[12:50:52] <Krinkle> checking php error log
[12:50:54] <Krinkle> wtf

[12:51:29] <Krinkle> but that's not relevant

[12:51:58] <Krinkle> Getting the same exception in in my browser after 30 escons
[12:51:59] <Krinkle> seconds*
[12:52:25] <Krinkle> So the problem at hand (might not be the root cause) is that we have a query on the Runpage that is too slow
[12:52:43] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[12:52:51] <scott_gonzalez> That DB has some EXPLAINing to do :-P
[12:52:56] <Krinkle> yeah
[12:53:05] <Krinkle> enabling debug mode on jqswarm now
[12:55:14] <Krinkle> the annoying thing about a slow query is that it is slow :P
[12:55:25] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:55:46] <scott_gonzalez> If the slow queries were fast, they wouldn't be annoying :-)
[12:55:57] <Krinkle> Hm.. this doesn't make any sense (you make sense, I'm referring to my screen)
[12:56:12] <Krinkle> the query that it fails on is a basic INSERT query, not a slow select or anything
[12:57:20] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: do we have phpMyAdmin on jqswarm ?
[12:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[12:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden gnarf ^
[12:58:23] <danheberden> absolutely not
[12:58:34] <danheberden> you can use a client app to connect over ssh tho
[12:58:41] <danheberden> i use sequelpro

[13:00:13] <Krinkle> I'll try the same from cli

[13:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> How big is that table and how many indexes are there?
[13:01:40] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: working on it..
[13:02:29] <Krinkle> btw, this will be somewhat solved with the "projects" thing I'm working on for TestSwarm (issue148)

[13:10:58] <scott_gonzalez> bah
[13:11:32] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: any clue why mysqld is at 60+% CPU? Or is that what got you started?
[13:11:45] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: It is likely related yes
[13:12:20] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: The insert query for a new client (that is run when a new clients opens the run page with a valid run token) takes 47 seconds
[13:12:42] <jzaefferer> nice
[13:12:58] <jzaefferer> are there other inserts that run in a regular time?
[13:13:03] <Krinkle> I can't explain it any way other than to blame the load on the server, which is a bit of a paradox
[13:13:19] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I know that a regular select is doing fine, the home works
[13:13:26] <Krinkle> Let me try an insert on another table

[13:17:25] <Krinkle> I just tried another run client, this some 39 seconds instead of 47. Which means it is fast enough for PHP not to kill the query

[13:21:19] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: no other constraints

[13:47:17] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: k, I stopped it
[13:47:20] <Krinkle> *msyqld)
[13:47:23] <Krinkle>  /etc/init.d/mysqld start --slow_query_log=1 --slow_query_log_file="/srv/swarm.jquery.org/mysql-slow_query_log.log"
[13:47:57] <Krinkle> hm..
[13:48:00] <Krinkle> I'm not sure I did it right
[13:48:33] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I have no idea, but maybe snover has?
[13:49:03] <Krinkle> yeah, the options have to be passed to the lib executable, not to mysqld. Not sure, I feel like I'm at the edge of my mysql experience
[13:49:04] <snover> you can’t pass things to mysqld from the init script
[13:49:10] <Krinkle> yeah, I figured
[13:49:10] <snover> set it in my.cnf
[13:49:13] <Krinkle> ok
[13:49:25] <snover> or, do what i said, and run show processlist as root when the problem is happening to look at what queries are stalling
[13:49:46] <Krinkle> snover: I want slow query log regardless of todays issues
[13:49:55] <Krinkle> to improve testswarm performance and see what indexes we need
[13:50:20] <Krinkle> snover: .my.cnf in /home/jqadmin? It is started as -user=mysql
[13:50:24] <snover> no
[13:50:30] <Krinkle> right, didn't think so
[13:50:52] <Krinkle> there is no /home/mysql
[13:52:53] <Krinkle> ah, /etc/.my.cnf
[13:59:10] <Krinkle> Stopping MySQL:                                            [  OK  ]
[13:59:10] <Krinkle> Timeout error occurred trying to start MySQL Daemon.
[13:59:11] <Krinkle> Starting MySQL:                                            [FAILED]
[13:59:17] <Krinkle> snover: that doesn't' look good
[13:59:22] <Krinkle> ^ /etc/init.d/mysqld restart
[13:59:31] <snover> maybe don’t put invalid things into the my.cnf :)
[13:59:54] <snover> also it is normally at /etc/mysql/my.cnf
[13:59:58] <snover> i have no idea what /etc/.my.cnf would be
[14:00:06] <Krinkle> 120529 13:58:01 [ERROR] /usr/libexec/mysqld: unknown variable 'slow_query_log=1'
[14:00:47] <Krinkle>  /etc/my.cnf not /etc/.my.cnf
[14:00:57] <Krinkle> according to mysql docs both can be the location, both are normal
[14:01:06] <Krinkle> what version of mysql is this anyway
[14:01:20] <Krinkle> 5.0.77
[14:01:31] <Krinkle> _-_
[14:04:25] <Krinkle> https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-options.html#option_mysqld_log-slow-queries
[14:04:31] <Krinkle> 5.0 is different
[14:06:20] <Krinkle>  using mysqld start --log-slow-queries=/srv/swarm.jquery.org/mysql-slow_query_log.log instead
[14:06:21] <Krinkle> works
[14:06:28] <Krinkle> not sure if the option is being used, but it started at least
[14:11:39] <snover> at this point you are dangerously close to breaking everything
[14:11:46] <snover> do not start mysqld directly
[14:12:02] <snover> you will not pick up the configuration files that it requires and you can mess up the binary logs and other things, making a crash irrecoverable
[14:12:52] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez rwaldron DaveMethvin Krinkle: I'd like to do another QUnit meeting. Thursday at noon EST in #jquery-meeting
[14:13:10] <jzaefferer> I also put it on http://jquerytesting.pbworks.com/w/page/41556026/FrontPage - in case anyone gets edit notifications there
[14:13:24] <jzaefferer> johnbender ^^^
[14:13:31] <jzaefferer> who else am I missing?
[14:13:32] <Krinkle> snover: I wasn't starting it directly, I omitted part of the paste
[14:13:35] <DaveMethvin> I will try to attend, i'm traveling this week so i am not sure if I can make it
[14:13:42] <Krinkle>  etc/init.d/
[14:15:57] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I'm in Berlin between tomorrow and next monday (Wikimedia Hackathon). But I'll be on IRC
[15:59:25] <Krinkle> wut?
[15:59:31] <Krinkle> douglas disabled the issue tracker in the JSLint repo
[15:59:39] <Krinkle> 404 error now

[15:59:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #129 on JSLint (Krinkle; 1w, 1d ago): Logo on jslint.com is pixelated
[15:59:43] <Krinkle> wtf

[15:59:55] <snover> hahahahaha
[17:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I'll be there, just remind me :-)
[17:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: If you filed a ticket like that against one of my repos, I might turn off issues too :-P
[17:37:24] <Krinkle> seriously? it looks like shit
[17:37:25] <Krinkle> jpeg-70
[17:37:26] <Krinkle> cmon what is this, 1997 ?
[17:38:31] <Krinkle> I like the new jslint design actually, but him using jpg-70 on the list site instead of the hq png that is on github doesn't make sense
[17:38:32] <Krinkle> it looks broken
[17:38:41] <Krinkle> live*
[17:39:38] <Krinkle> :D
[17:40:21] <snover> ircjsbot: tell Krinkle “I like the new jslint design actually” basically invalidates your opinion on all graphic design for eternity :)
[17:40:21] <ircjsbot> snover, OK, I will tell Krinkle if I see them.
