[19:15:36] <platinumazure> Hey folks, how's it going?
[19:17:11] <platinumazure> I'm trying to write up a pull request for jQuery and I'm getting jscs errors-- it's complaining of a bad line break between src/intro.js and src/core.js, though my text editors don't show an extra line break and git doesn't believe I've changed either file.
[19:17:14] <platinumazure> Is there anything I need to do to suppress that, or is jQuery master currently in a bad state, or...?
[19:17:28] <platinumazure> Oops! Sorry, not jQuery, QUnit. That's important.
[19:20:52] <arschmitz> platinumazure: it should be fine on master but im double checking now
[19:21:53] <arschmitz> platinumazure: yup all tests are green including jscs checks
[19:22:07] <platinumazure> arschmitz: Thanks! To be honest it wouldn't surprise me if my editor were injecting a newline and I was having some confusion due to \r\n vs \n or something. I just wanted to double-check there wasn't a known issue.
[19:22:25] <arschmitz> platinumazure: no problem 
[19:22:33] <arschmitz> line endings can be a pain
[19:23:12] <platinumazure> I'm using Git Shell (Bash-like interface) on Windows, so a line ending issue is slightly more likely on my setup than average
[19:23:26] <platinumazure> Any idea how I could check and/or remedy, by chance?
[19:23:37] <arschmitz> platinumazure: yeah i used to use that when i was on windows
[19:23:45] <arschmitz> platinumazure: its been a long time though
[19:24:36] <arschmitz> platinumazure: the editor config and the .gitattributes *should* take care of it for most cases
[19:24:36] <platinumazure> arschmitz: Thanks. I'll keep investigating on my end, then.
[19:24:55] <platinumazure> arschmitz: Right, I'll be looking there first.
[19:25:23] <arschmitz> platinumazure: you welcome
