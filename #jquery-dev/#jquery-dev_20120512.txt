[11:24:26] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.8pre] Fix #11621, $(document).trigger() must bubble to window. - Dave Methvin
[11:34:11] <gnarf> hey dave!
[11:35:51] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so, smaller 1.8 seems reasonable eh?
[11:36:02] <DaveMethvin> well, let's hope so
[11:36:09] <DaveMethvin> seems like we're all tucking and trimming
[11:36:33] <DaveMethvin> there will probably be some must-fix thing that takes 300 bytes :D

[11:50:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: did you see p776 ?
[11:51:07] <gnarf> 1.8 queue optimizations to deal with promise
[11:52:04] <DaveMethvin> i saw your late-night im on that ... looking now
[11:52:14] <gnarf> I'm wondering if there is a better way to define these "private" functions: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/commit/fdf5c5317891ee13dc9254ade44e8a61f34acb0b#L1R55
[11:52:15] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by gnarf37 (7h, 19m ago): Cleaning up queue/fn.promise: -97gzip
[11:52:42] <DaveMethvin> false promises, haha
[11:53:02] <gnarf> the $.fn.promise issue was worse that I had thought... It actually lumps "unqueued" animations into the "fx" queue
[11:53:39] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: queue: false promises ;)
[11:54:05] <DaveMethvin> hey you read it  your way, i'll read it mine
[11:54:22] <gnarf> we need to queue false promises !
[11:54:43] <gnarf> like "1.8 will be bug free"
[11:55:26] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:08:43] <gnarf> i knew i'd get some bytes out with that code base
[12:08:52] <gnarf> who knew that queue has so many ripe for the pickin ;)
[12:10:10] <gnarf> i gotta run to a friends grad party
[12:11:44] <DaveMethvin> wow that's pretty slick gnarf

[12:42:19] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.8pre] Preserves context objects when multiple Deferreds are passed to $.when(). Context is an array containing the original contexts in order. When non-observable value is given, associated context is undefined. In case only a single non-observable value is given, context is the global object (thanks so much Function.prototype.apply!). Fixes #11749. - jaubourg

[13:49:22] <jaubourg> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/GLcJE/
[14:14:49] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: you around?
[14:15:08] <DaveMethvin> this fail seems to be due to that issue with html comments being /* */ out
[14:15:09] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/index.php?action=runresults&run_id=970&client_id=6995
[14:16:19] <jaubourg> that's 1.8pre?
[14:16:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[14:17:33] <DaveMethvin> ah here it is jaubourg: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10285
[14:18:03] <DaveMethvin> do we need to comment out those comments? Can't we just remove them?
[14:18:44] <jaubourg> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11402
[14:19:11] <jaubourg> let me check what's going on in IE9, because what's happening doesn't make sense... at all
[14:19:28] <DaveMethvin> oh, believe me jaubourg it didn't make sense :D
[14:20:02] <DaveMethvin> ///*-->\n*/   generates a syntax error but ///*-->*/ does not
[14:20:20] <DaveMethvin> who knows what lurks in the heart of ie9
[14:20:31] <jaubourg> bwahahaha... I'm so stupid :/
[14:21:14] <jaubourg> now I get it, it's about the replacer, not the regexp
[14:21:20] <jaubourg> damn, how blind one can be sometimes
[14:21:52] <DaveMethvin> so why *are* those commented out and just just plain removed?
[14:22:25] <jaubourg> because I'm stupid?
[14:22:42] <DaveMethvin> lol, you aren't taking MY title, buddy
[14:23:26] <jaubourg> I invented stupid :P
[14:23:50] <DaveMethvin> right, and al gore invented the internet
[14:24:02] <jaubourg> oh, you know about that?
[14:24:09] <jaubourg> SEE I AM STUPID AND GULLIBLE
[14:24:13] <jaubourg> \o/
[14:24:31] <jaubourg> let me fix this stupid replacement mistake
[14:24:36] <jaubourg> and gain bytes
[14:24:38] <jaubourg> \o/

[14:27:36] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.8pre] Fixes #10285 (for real this time). - jaubourg
[14:27:56] <jaubourg> done
[14:28:44] <DaveMethvin> i'll let jq-jenkins be the judge of that!
[14:29:00] <DaveMethvin> altho we have several other fails
[14:29:17] <jaubourg> yeah, I saw that
[14:29:20] <jaubourg> let's tackle those
[14:29:35] <jaubourg> I saw one in chrome locally
[14:29:41] <jaubourg> about an IE bug fix no less
[14:30:14] <jaubourg> yep, in the each test of core
[14:30:51] <jaubourg> we seem to have the wrong number of stylesheets
[14:31:41] <jaubourg> new swarm look is teh awesome btw
[14:32:12] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/80  yeah i agree ... if we could only get a SUCCEED i would be soooo  happy !
[14:33:23] <DaveMethvin> there must be some way we can desupport IE6, it's hard to believe anyone could really be using it
[14:33:51] <DaveMethvin> i am pretty sure the the only people using ie6 are web devs using it to see if their code still works
[14:36:46] <jaubourg> and half of china... :/

[14:43:05] <jq-jenkins> j: Fixes #10285 (for real this time).
[14:44:25] <DaveMethvin> The Safari 5.0 fails are the only ones consistent across http://swarm.jquery.org/job/79 and http://swarm.jquery.org/job/80 so far
[14:45:01] <DaveMethvin> oh plus the ajax timeouts on 5.1
[14:45:06] <jaubourg> ok
[14:45:19] <jaubourg> I'll check safari 5.1, see if ajax fails locally for me
[14:47:35] <DaveMethvin> safari 5.1 on windows passes just ajax, lemme try a full unit test run
[14:47:57] <jaubourg> damn, I was still on safari 4.x
[14:48:04] <jaubourg> wtf is wrong with auto-update?
[14:48:40] <DaveMethvin> hey grampa, get with the program there! :P
[14:49:44] <jaubourg> haha
[14:54:48] <jaubourg> no timeout here either
[14:54:50] <jaubourg> :/
[14:55:31] <jaubourg> didn't we get rid of this #2 adding to the url?
[14:56:55] <jaubourg> full run passing too
[14:57:33] <jaubourg> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/80 \o/ no more ajax timeout for safari 5.1 \o/
[14:57:38] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: ^^
[14:58:11] <DaveMethvin> sweet, just that one saf5.0 thing left so far
[14:58:18] <DaveMethvin> AND  HURRY UP OLDIE!
[14:58:51] <DaveMethvin> i think we may need to ship 1.8 and say "the IE6/7/8 unit tests are still running, we'll let you know when they finish"
[14:59:33] <jaubourg> you know what?
[14:59:50] <jaubourg> now that we don't add a secondary body, why do we keep this unit test
[14:59:50] <DaveMethvin> wat
[14:59:59] <jaubourg> (the one failing in safari 5.0)
[15:00:03] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[15:00:15] <jaubourg> we don't need it
[15:00:32] <DaveMethvin> well mister jaw-bore, you make a good point
[15:00:50] <DaveMethvin> if you can't beat em, delete em
[15:02:08] <jaubourg> hmm, not so simple
[15:02:16] <jaubourg> the properties should match... weird
[15:02:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah, when i run the full unit tests on IE9 I crash the test "A background on the testElement does not cause IE8 to crash (#9823)"
[15:03:16] <DaveMethvin> so, the ie8-crashy test also crashes ie9 i guess
[15:03:22] <DaveMethvin> but not in the swarm
[15:03:51] <DaveMethvin> oh IE, why must you be so fickle?
[15:04:05] <DaveMethvin> whoops, gotta go (according to my wife)
[15:04:52] <jaubourg> ?tell DaveMethvin same here :P
[15:04:53] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[16:07:22] <Krinkle> lol @ DaveMethvin
[16:07:42] <Krinkle> IE9 fixed as well, nice
[18:38:40] <DaveMethvin> .
[18:38:41] <bot-t> (3 hours 33 mins ago) <jaubourg> tell DaveMethvin same here :P
