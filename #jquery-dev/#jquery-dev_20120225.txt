[07:21:16] <kanzie> ok, so the problem with the extreme leak is not jQuery per se but my tests show that the parseFromString() in DOMParser is leaking like a sieve. What can I do to parse XML without using DOMParser and where do I report such a bug?

[13:09:43] <kanzie> ok, I have to give up with this memory-leak, I can't seem to isolate it enough. It seems to be in DOMParser when loading the XML using xhr. When feeding a variable with the string to DOMParser it works better.
[13:10:22] <kanzie> Anyhow, when running 1.4.4 I have no leak at all. Is there any way I can lift the ajax() from 1.4.4 into 1.7.1 or can someone help me think about what to do.
