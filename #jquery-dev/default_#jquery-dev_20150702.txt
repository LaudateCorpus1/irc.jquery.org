[05:37:56] <brennino> hi, I'm trying to make synchronous ajax calls chain, with jquery deferred objects, with a custom attribute but I can't understand how to do them correctly.
[05:38:05] <brennino> I follow this answer on stackoverflow: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16026942/how-do-i-chain-three-asynchronous-calls-using-jquery-promises
[05:38:27] <brennino> but I need custom arguments on functions.
[05:39:00] <arthurvr> brennino: Please use #jquery for support questions instead. This channel is for development purposes only. Also please read the topic of channels you join :)
[05:39:01] <brennino> this is a jsbin for try to make you understand better what I need;

[08:50:49] <ArtyomShegeda> hello
[08:51:33] <ArtyomShegeda> why does the issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1782 still not fixed?
[08:56:01] <scott_gonzalez> ArtyomShegeda: Did you read the comments?
[08:56:09] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1782#issuecomment-99224484
[08:56:37] <ArtyomShegeda> ok, coming to the problem from other side: how to write the test case and include it into the release testing flow?
[08:57:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the first step is providing a test case outside of the repo.
[08:58:06] <scott_gonzalez> The smallest possible test page that shows the problem.
[08:58:33] <ArtyomShegeda> so, it should be a regular html with the script that reproduces the issue, right?
[08:58:35] <scott_gonzalez> If possible, use jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com
[08:58:38] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[08:58:51] <ArtyomShegeda> nice. what is the next?
[08:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> Writing an actual unit test.
[08:59:21] <scott_gonzalez> See https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/ajax.js
[09:03:07] <ArtyomShegeda> nice. the test for the issue: http://jsfiddle.net/ArtyomShegeda/yspk9cnz/
