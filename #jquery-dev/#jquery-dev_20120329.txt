[08:27:35] <deAtog> rwaldron: I hit that attr issue while developing with jQuery Mobile.. jQuery's site says to use 1.7.2 or newer with jQuery Mobile 1.1.0. The only version of jQuery Mobile 1.1.0 currently available is 1.1.0 RC1 which doesn't work with jQuery 1.7.2 due to the behavior change in $.fn(opt, undefined) The changes needed in jQuery Mobile exist in their master branch, but not RC1. Bug reports about this issue simply stated the bug w

[08:57:46] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: got time today or tomorrow to help convert some old pages/actions to new class based?
[08:57:56] <Krinkle> I've done half a dozen yesterday, it's getting dull :P
[08:58:04] <Krinkle> Krinkle/testswarm, branch issue132
[08:58:40] <Krinkle> if you could do one or two that'd be great (also good excersise to get to know the new classes, and confirmation to me that it is sane)
[08:59:15] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Tomorrow should work

[10:53:12] * gnarf sighs
[10:53:17] <gnarf> wtf is up with trac?
[10:53:31] <gnarf> like every time i view it its a mysql error
[11:30:43] <rwaldron> deAtog sorry i missed your mesage earlier
[11:31:08] <rwaldron> jQuery Mobile team is aware of the issues and the fix will be in the next release
[11:31:19] <rwaldron> ...which it appears you're aware of
[11:31:34] <gibson042> rwaldron: what news from the mark? how goes the patch?
[11:32:10] <rwaldron> gibson042 we're keeping all of your changes
[11:32:14] <rwaldron> and patching over that
[11:32:25] <rwaldron> but there still needs to be discussion
[11:32:50] <rwaldron> the answer is basically... there is no answer yet
[11:33:18] <rwaldron> so, there may be no patch
[11:33:26] <gibson042> oh, wow
[11:35:10] <gibson042> I'm glad to find out that this isn't quite the catastrophe it appeared to be yesterday
[11:42:54] <gnarf> that duck punch in tinyMCE that ajpiano pointed out is annoying
[11:43:23] <gnarf> cuz like, they always seem to be passing arguments anyway, i really don't understand why they didn't make it use apply
[11:44:20] <gibson042> I'm with you
[11:45:15] <gibson042> why would one assume that a signature wouldn't change *IN* code that changes that signature
[11:49:21] <ajpiano> yeah, it's pretty silly
[11:49:28] <ajpiano> tinymce is the perfect storm for this though
[15:46:09] <LakWork> anyone know why http://dev.jquery.com/ is down?
[15:48:16] <danheberden> LakWork cuz it never existed, we just haven't fixed the link yet :(
[15:48:18] <danheberden> bugs.jquery.com
[15:48:43] <LakWork> well that's good to know; unfortunately, bugs.jquery.com is also down
[15:49:00] <danheberden> LakWork if you keep trying, it'll fire up
[15:49:06] <danheberden> i think i'm gonna kill it and reboote it
[15:52:08] <danheberden> LakWork there we go
[15:52:12] <danheberden> a bit more responsive
[15:52:15] <snover> danheberden: dunno what you mean “never”, it used to exist, then it was replaced
[15:52:25] <snover> and everything was redirected dev -> bugs
[15:53:28] <danheberden> snover - i meant "i don't want to explain a situation that doesn't need to be explained and i'm going to say never to someone who doesn't need the whole story because i'm going to tell them it's at bugs.jquery.com"
[15:53:39] <danheberden> but in the end, i blame the bourbon
[15:53:49] <snover> :)
[15:53:52] <danheberden> also, hi and <3z
[15:53:54] <danheberden> :)
[15:54:01] <snover> tl;dr quit breaking it
[15:54:04] <snover> and then nobody will ask questions
[15:54:04] <snover> :)
[16:01:42] <LakWork> nice thanks danheberden
[16:02:34] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Liked the slide transition from jQuery Mobile 1.0? We heard you. For RC2: slide (like 1.0) and slidefade (1.1 style) - http://t.co/mQapMIlP ★ http://bit.ly/HpkLvd
[16:36:15] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Thanks for your feedback on 1.1RC1 everyone. We've been listening. RC2 took time to get right but we plan on shipping late next week. ★ http://bit.ly/H0UJOh
[17:57:52] <miketaylr> ajpiano: do you guize need a tinymce contact?
[17:58:35] <gnarf> miketaylr: it'd prolly be useful since it seems they might have the big sticky attr duckpunch thats bugging out 1.7.2
[17:58:42] <miketaylr> yeah just reading the thread
[17:58:53] <gnarf> miketaylr: you got the bug # on trac?
[17:58:55] <miketaylr> maybe i'll just drop their email in the thread
[18:00:02] <gnarf> miketaylr: which thread you talkin about?
[18:01:56] <miketaylr> gnarf: "rash of reports regarding $(this).attr(foo) on jquery-bugs-team
[18:01:58] <miketaylr> "
[18:02:05] <gnarf> hrm
[18:02:16] <gnarf> i wonder if my bugs-team isn't getting delivered right
[18:02:34] <gnarf> NEVERMIND!
[18:02:41] <gnarf> just was looking in the wrong mailbox
[18:05:14] <miketaylr> hehe
[18:05:19] <miketaylr> yeah, i rarely check any gmails
[18:05:25] <miketaylr> once a week, if that
[18:06:55] <gnarf> miketaylr: but yeah, i think an actual "contact" for tinymce would help that thread along
[18:07:50] <miketaylr> ya just snet
