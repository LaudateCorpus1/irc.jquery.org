[11:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> leobalter: This is the error I'm getting: http://cl.ly/image/1a04181N0i1G
[11:16:39] <leobalter> these tests are affected by the run order, maybe opening the html in other tab or setting `QUnit.config.reorder = false` would help. I can't make it fail here. It's even passing 
[11:16:49] <leobalter> it's even passing on browserstack
[11:16:56] <leobalter> (Chrome, etc)
[11:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, yup, killing the reorder fixed it.
[11:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably disable reordering in the QUnit tests.
[11:19:47] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I'm not sure if people care, but the new diffing logic is a bit whacky with booleans.
[11:20:43] <arthurvr> Yeah I thought about it too ^
[11:20:53] <arthurvr> No big deal but it appears to look a little weird
[11:33:00] <leobalter> It is a big deal to me, it's very annoying. I thought I commented on https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/786 yesterday, but I missed that
[11:33:33] <leobalter> I'll see if I can include a boolean check to avoid that diff
