[08:31:10] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Can you go through https://github.com/dmethvin/pointerevents-test and send a PR for https://github.com/w3c/web-platform-tests/ ?
[08:31:57] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez yes, although i've been dreading it because it won't be an hour or two worth of work
[08:44:20] <snover> so it will be only like 15 minutes of work then?
[08:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Jacob Rossi is going to submit some tests from the IE team.
[08:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> So you can wait until that PR comes in before dealing with the TTWF tests.
[08:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> So you can avoid trying to merge any duplicate tests.
[08:55:36] <DaveMethvin> plus I can follow their template ... all these tests are pretty messy since the people weren't familiar with anything
[08:55:44] <DaveMethvin> but of course neither was I ... :)

[10:49:29] <DaveMethvin> jQuery Migrate: NOW WITH MORE UNSTABLE!
[10:50:11] <Danwe_WMDE> I just got a little deeper into jQuery's internals and just got really aware that each time jQuery.fn.pushStack gets called by any jQurey.fn. member, a whole copy of the jquery object is being done. It seems like most jQuery optimization tips do not consider this. When they recommend using something like $( '.foo' ).not( '.bar' ) instead of $( '.foo:not(.bar)' ), this might be a good tip on CPU critcal tasks but can lead to much 
[10:50:11] <Danwe_WMDE> higher memory usage when operating on sets with lots of DOM nodes, or am I missing something?
[10:50:43] <DaveMethvin> Danwe_WMDE it only matters if you save the result in a variable
[10:51:13] <Danwe_WMDE> DaveMethvin: right, otherwise the garbage collector will hit it anyhow
[10:52:06] <Danwe_WMDE> DaveMethvin: I guess this would be worth testing to give some advanced performance tips. Or do you know about any existing test? I searched a little but always ended up with totally unrelated basic topics.
[10:52:41] <DaveMethvin> the best way to deal with perf is to profile the code you find is slow or using too much memory
[10:52:48] <DaveMethvin> otherwise it's usually premature optimization
[10:53:33] <Danwe_WMDE> DaveMethvin: Would be nice to have a general idea to estimate which way would be preferred in certain situations
[10:54:05] <Danwe_WMDE> in some situations I'd prefer that premature optimization vs. no optimization at all because of lack of time
[10:54:11] <DaveMethvin> but it varies so much
[10:54:31] <DaveMethvin> $(".thing").not(".other") could filter 10 elements or 1000
[10:54:44] <DaveMethvin> if it starts with 10 there isn't much to worry about
[10:54:56] <DaveMethvin> if you start preoptimizing everything the code gets ugly
[10:55:41] <Danwe_WMDE> I gess you can say in gernal that the more elements you think you will end up with in the end, the more the tendency is given to give just one long filter string
[10:56:38] <DaveMethvin> you'd need to benchmark it *in situ* to know
[11:41:59] <doesallmagic2> Yippie, build fixed!

[12:40:46] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: migrate it still failing the same test on 1.x: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/974
[12:40:48] <Krinkle> consistently attr('value') undefied instead of empty string
[12:41:20] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle yeah, gibson042 was going to take a look
[13:04:34] <gnarf> http://code.jquery.com/ - see jquery-wp-content or shitty manual index page?
[13:14:32] <mikesherov> gnarf: what's up?
[13:26:19] <gnarf> mikesherov: was a PR 
[13:26:25] <gnarf> mikesherov: also cc'ed on github
[13:26:38] <mikesherov> yeah
[13:26:41] <mikesherov> I don't like it
[13:27:05] <gnarf> i didn't like it either
[13:30:51] <gnarf> i feel like its a fix that breaks something else
[13:30:57] <gnarf> just not sure what
[13:30:59] <gnarf> or why
[13:33:39] <mikesherov> but it also is just ugly
[13:33:54] <mikesherov> in the sense that it seems like this should be fixable elsewhere
[13:34:00] <mikesherov> not that the patch itself is bad

[13:59:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: are you seeing the new jquery-wp-content code.jquery.com yet?
[13:59:55] <gnarf> or still getting the old stuff
[13:59:58] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[14:00:18] <DaveMethvin> still the old for me
[14:00:30] <DaveMethvin> it's taken a while in the past
[14:00:51] <gnarf> yeah - this could be up to a week
[14:00:57] <gnarf> the ttl was set really really long
[14:01:17] <DaveMethvin> a day is prob the highest we'd want to go
[14:01:46] <DaveMethvin> damn that old page is ugly
