[05:04:22] <Tyvara> hey guys i have a little problem: i can dynamically add a svg-element (group) to a canvas based on a type and i want to add this type to the group... if i do it like this: $('g').attr("data-element-type", id); then it works perfect for the first but if i add another one, every group gets updated with the new id... how can i say that only the newly added group should get its type-id? :S
[06:51:37] <shoky> Tyvara: that's a question for #jquery . #jquery-dev is for development chat
[07:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> Why is our TestSwarm instance named yaySwarm?
[07:32:30] <pbramos> In terms of the jQuery style guide, which is correct/preferred?
[07:32:36] <pbramos> ok( jQuery( "#first" ).parent().parent().is( ".red" ), "Check if wrapper has class 'red'" );    or...
[07:32:46] <pbramos> ok( jQuery("#first").parent().parent().is(".red"), "Check if wrapper has class 'red'" );
[07:32:53] <pbramos> Or both are correct?
[07:33:00] <gibson042> pbramos: the latter
[07:33:20] <gibson042> no spaces when parentheses enclose only a single string
[07:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> That exception drives me nutes.
[07:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> s/nutes/nuts/
[07:33:48] <gibson042> clearly ;)
[07:34:08] <gibson042> I hear ya, but I can also see why we have it
[07:34:26] <pbramos> I guess my question is, will code that doesn't necessarily follow that exception (the former example) be rejected?
[07:34:42] <pbramos> To me, from the style guide, it seemed like that was up to the coder to decide which style to use
[07:38:01] <gibson042> not necessarily, but it's probably best to stick with the style near code that you're working on

[17:55:50] <pbramos> I do see it in jquery/jquery though hm
[17:56:20] <jaubourg> Dave likes to squash PRs into a single commit

[18:53:46] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: you're on fire
[18:54:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah we're at ajpiano's place here in nyc
[18:54:11] <jaubourg> oh, I get it now ;)
[18:54:19] <DaveMethvin> we will LEAVE NO TEST  UNFAILED!
[18:54:28] <jaubourg> haha
[18:54:43] <DaveMethvin> so those failed ajax tests, didn't see whether they were accounted for
[18:54:44] <jaubourg> I need to get in touch with Krinkle about those 12 ajax tests
[18:54:53] <DaveMethvin> i broke some in manip i'm looking at
[18:55:12] <jaubourg> all ajax unit pass all right in all browsers using browserstack
[18:55:32] <jaubourg> so it's probably some apache/php conf discrepancy
[18:55:40] <DaveMethvin> GAAH
[18:55:45] <jaubourg> exactly
[18:56:03] <jaubourg> welcome to AjaxLand where the Evil Server Side rules
[18:56:30] <gibson042> keep going, we still need to break effects for the hat trick
[18:56:35] <jaubourg> what did you think of the removal of a gazillion php scripts btw?
[18:56:40] <DaveMethvin> NONE SHALL PASS
[19:03:33] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: me likey, much cleaner now
[19:03:55] <DaveMethvin> i had to double check to make sure it wasn't a mistake

[19:06:13] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: yeah, it always puzzled me we had so much logic hidden into php code... it's much easier to know what's going on with the new approach.
[19:07:25] <jaubourg> Anyway, I passed so much time of those I almost gave up... was all "OMG finally!" when I hit the $.put units

[22:09:00] <Krinkle> jaubourg: Its a miracle of coincidence that it worked on your local web server configuration. There various inconsistencies and small triggers that could've gone wrong.

[23:04:01] <Krinkle> gibson042: +1 for converting to echo.php instead of echo/.
[23:06:32] <gibson042> yeah, I'm just not 100% sure about https://github.com/gibson042/jquery/blob/8f3ecbe2348aacb0616c7308b710f37cf44fb736/test/unit/ajax.js#L777,L781 etc.
[23:06:59] <gibson042> but I still think those could be dealt with a different way if they absolutely require such structure
[23:09:02] <gibson042> Krinkle is the rest of testing infrastructure up? I'm considering landing that patch just to confirm success
[23:09:38] <Krinkle> Well, our side is just swell :)
[23:09:56] <Krinkle> browserstack still doens't have their shit together (or atleast we don't know what we're doing wrong)
[23:10:23] <Krinkle> safari 6 has about 99% fail rate of lost VMs every day
[23:10:31] <Krinkle> but yeah, land it
[23:10:47] <Krinkle> jenkins and testswarm are fine and chrome is working on browserstack
[23:10:54] <Krinkle> which gives us all we need
[23:11:16] <gibson042> allright; buckle up :)
