[08:21:52] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know for sure which version of iOS added Touch Events?
[08:23:52] <m_gol> what do you need it for? or just curiosity?
[08:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> For my keynote in Austin.
[08:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> I have a timeline of important dates for Touch/Pointer Events.
[08:34:25] <snover> scott_gonzalez: ios 2.0
[08:34:41] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks snover.
[08:42:33] <m_gol> for a moment I though it's been from the beginning
[08:43:07] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: nice, I'll certainly watch your keynote once it's online, seems interesting :)
[08:43:30] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I thought too.
[08:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> But then I realized I had no proof.
[08:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> And doing a Google search for this wasn't returning anything useful.
[08:46:35] <m_gol> and BrowserStack's oldest iOS is 3.0
[08:54:44] <jgornick> Hey guys, when I grab 1.10.2 using bower and load the minified file, when an error happens, it loads the jquery.min.map file which then has the source set to jquery-1.10.2.js. However, that files isn't in the distribution, the file without the version exists.
[08:59:17] <m_gol> jgornick: could you create a bug report? these source map naming issues will kill us one day :/
[08:59:33] <jgornick> m_gol, Yeah, will do.
[09:19:50] <jgornick> m_gol: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14336
[09:20:05] <m_gol> jgornick: thanks!
[09:20:08] <DaveMethvin> jgornick thanks for testing!
[09:20:21] <DaveMethvin> i'm about ready to rip out that sourcemap stuff, such a pain
[09:20:26] <jgornick> Ha!
[09:21:05] <jgornick> Would it be possible to always name the files without the versions in them?
[09:21:26] <jgornick> I can see right now it's mixed. Sometimes you distribute jQuery with the version in the file name.
[09:21:37] <DaveMethvin> well, until some poor guy renames them thinking "what difference would that make?"
[09:22:08] <jgornick> That's true.
[09:22:09] <DaveMethvin> i think sourcemaps should have a way to assume the name of the map based on the name of the min file
[09:22:16] <DaveMethvin> if they did it would be less error prone
[09:22:23] <jgornick> Gotcha.
[09:22:31] <jgornick> Well, rip it out :)
[09:22:59] <DaveMethvin> so i'm guessing you didn't really need sourcemaps but noticed the 404 fetching it?
[09:23:10] <DaveMethvin> seems like a common complaint
[09:23:31] <DaveMethvin> because a lot of people just grab the min file and don't realize they  need the uncompressed and map as well now
[09:23:49] <jgornick> Yeah, the 404 seemed to stop chrome from debugging any further.
[09:24:12] <DaveMethvin> you can turn off sourcemaps

[09:24:39] <snover> the solution is people need to be not dumb
[09:24:44] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/dfaee326e6605dc6d848c4c5022e39069d2cee65
[09:24:55] <DaveMethvin> snover in other words, rip it out.
[09:25:07] <snover> because people are not going to be not dumb?
[09:25:22] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:25:53] <snover> should probably shut down jquery then :)
[09:26:14] <snover> ‚Äúwe decided to stop developing open source software because people can‚Äôt not be dumb‚Äù
[09:26:38] <DaveMethvin> we made a major change here without realizing it
[09:27:14] <DaveMethvin> we went from ".min.js is all you need" to "Chrome will scream bloody murder if you don't have the map and uncompressed file"
[09:27:24] <DaveMethvin> it only affects Chrome right now
[09:27:51] <m_gol> I've just switched pragma to //#; everything supports it now and grunt-contrib-uglify as well so I could rip our manual handling of it out
[09:27:51] <DaveMethvin> but if others support this spec it will spread
[09:28:16] <DaveMethvin> m_gol yeah that hack was soooooo ugly, thanks
[09:28:38] <m_gol> we still have one large hack
[09:28:41] <m_gol> for the banner issue
[09:28:49] <m_gol> but at least no manual //@ //# handling
[09:29:16] <snover> what is the practical ramification of a 404 being thrown on a source map failure
[09:29:17] <snover> nothing
[09:29:24] <m_gol> now, to finish lazy loading for 1.x :)
[09:29:36] <snover> it‚Äôs like people complaining about strict firefox warnings
[09:29:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah it is ... and remember what a mess that was :)
[09:29:48] <m_gol> snover: the practical ramification is that if people open a console and see an error, they assume it's their fault
[09:30:00] <DaveMethvin> not if it says JQUERY they dont! :)
[09:30:05] <snover> it‚Äôs not your job or my job to protect people from being retards
[09:30:31] <DaveMethvin> i don't think it's retarded at all, it's not clear
[09:30:45] <m_gol> snover: we protect people from carriers being retards by still supporting Android 2.3
[09:30:49] <DaveMethvin> now, the solution is to google for "missing map" or such and figure it out
[09:31:06] <DaveMethvin> but the fact it throws that error confuses people
[09:31:07] <snover> m_gol: and i think i already said that I think that‚Äôs a bad choice too :)

[09:32:13] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: as for lazy tests
[09:32:31] <m_gol> we had a couple of checks to make the support module exit ASAP in poor envs
[09:32:38] <m_gol> that's all gone now after refactor
[09:32:45] <m_gol> will have to think about it
[09:33:13] <DaveMethvin> m_gol agreed but we may not reach that code in those envs
[09:33:24] <m_gol> yeah
[09:33:34] <DaveMethvin> one situation i can recall is when you're in a frameset page and there is no body, we can't do offset checks
[09:33:39] <m_gol> I guess we can merge this PR as soon as we figure out why 3 tests are failing, this is a large code moving anyway so we can fix some minor issues later
[09:33:56] <DaveMethvin> nobody should be calling .offset() in a frameset page :)
[09:33:58] <m_gol> right
[09:34:02] <m_gol> that's for 1.x only, though
[09:34:05] <DaveMethvin> those failing tests have me puzzled
[09:34:20] <m_gol> me too...
[09:34:37] <DaveMethvin> i haven't had time to try your built file
[09:34:43] <m_gol> since even expect(sth) doesn't execute, I guess the code doesn't exit the iframe correctly
[09:34:53] <m_gol> since it's all in iframe tests
[09:35:04] <DaveMethvin> but other iframe tests work ... strange
[09:35:17] <DaveMethvin> and those don't seem particularly harder than many others
[09:35:29] <m_gol> yeah, that's what puzzles me
[09:35:34] <m_gol> can't find what's common between them
[09:35:40] <DaveMethvin> the long-loading page wont' have fired document ready yet, dunno if that's relevant
[09:35:58] <m_gol> on master it shouldn't as I moved body tests to docElem
[09:36:01] <DaveMethvin> so some of our support tests needed ready
[09:36:08] <DaveMethvin> oh right
[09:36:17] <m_gol> besides, the exact same tests fail in Chrome & Fx in the same way
[09:36:17] <DaveMethvin> well maybe that's why it broke :)
[09:36:21] <m_gol> hahaha
[09:36:34] <m_gol> but I have a separate commit just for moving body tests to docelem
[09:36:43] <m_gol> I believe this one commit didn't introduce failures
[09:36:45] <m_gol> lemme check
[09:38:50] <m_gol> yup, no failures there
[09:38:57] <m_gol> just after breaking into modules
[09:39:17] <DaveMethvin> so this is recent damage, i guess that's good :P

[11:42:48] <m_gol> wtf
[11:43:03] <m_gol> I have a weird bug in IE8 so I wanted to debug it
[11:43:05] <m_gol> >>data

[11:51:09] <snover> if someone has overwritten undefined it‚Äôs time to fire them out of a cannon into the sun
[11:55:17] <m_gol> nah, it was just some internal page-sandbox for doing some tests, like undefined immutability and it wasn't reset later

[17:27:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah m_gol what's up?
[17:27:13] <m_gol> seems these failures might have sth to do with using documentElement
[17:27:25] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[17:27:33] <m_gol> I mean I don't get these same errors on the 1.x refactor where I keep using body
[17:27:49] <m_gol> weird that all browsers fail on the same tests, though

[17:34:12] <m_gol> funny thing, refactor on master results in 27 bytes gzipped *less*
[17:34:24] <m_gol> on 1.x-master it adds 428 bytes, though
[17:34:38] <m_gol> probably can be lowered down but there will be some size increase
[17:34:57] <DaveMethvin> m_gol if you ever figure out gzip you are a genius, it surprises me every time
[17:35:01] <m_gol> :)
[17:35:28] <m_gol> well, on master even the minified file is smaller by 50 bytes
[17:35:41] <m_gol> that explains why gzipped version is smaller as well ;)
[17:36:15] <m_gol> I guess it may have sth in common with switching to docElem but we have to figure out if it doesn't cause too many problems
[17:38:32] <m_gol> I hope no one is planning any huge commits now or I'll have some happy rebasing :D
[17:38:49] <DaveMethvin> happy and rebasing never go together for me
[17:39:12] <m_gol> ;)
[17:39:21] <m_gol> ah, one surprise
[17:39:34] <m_gol> the refactor caused one support test to start failing on IE8
[17:39:47] <m_gol> and when I did it manually from F12 console it fails as well
[17:39:56] <m_gol> other browsers seem to pass it as before
[17:40:01] <DaveMethvin> well at least it's consistent
[17:40:07] <m_gol> I'm talking about the checkClone test
[17:42:37] <m_gol> meh, IE9 fails it as well now, adding to the TODO list...
[17:43:00] <DaveMethvin> that's really strange
[18:03:12] <m_gol> even IE11 fails this test now
