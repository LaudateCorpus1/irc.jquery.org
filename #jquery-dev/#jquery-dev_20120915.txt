[00:10:38] <johnbender> snover: was the purpose simply to normalize the names or is it a compatability issue as well
[00:10:44] <johnbender> I noticed there are some non standard mappings
[00:11:02] <johnbender> snover: sorry, let me rephrase
[00:11:22] <snover> they are all compatibility fixes :P
[00:11:27] <johnbender> snover: was the purpose to provide downcased convenience properties or to normalize property names across browsers
[00:11:32] <johnbender> snover: cool
[00:11:49] <johnbender> snover: the equivalent in attr is just for convenience I assume?
[00:12:29] <johnbender> snover: well, rowspan: "rowSpan" ?
[00:13:28] <johnbender> snover: the equivelant in attr, being name.toLowerCase()
[00:14:58] <johnbender> snover1: where did I loose you?
[00:15:10] <johnbender> snover: the equivalent in attr is just for convenience I assume?
[00:15:13] <johnbender> snover: the equivelant in attr, being name.toLowerCase()
[00:15:25] <snover1> i donâ€™t know what you are talking about
[00:15:49] <johnbender> gnarf: it downcases the name when it's not xml
[00:15:55] <johnbender> mishighlight
[00:16:03] <johnbender> snover: it downcases the name when it's not xml
[00:16:51] <snover> attr sure does!
[00:17:07] <johnbender> snover: and that's just a convenience for devs?
[00:17:17] <snover> it is a normalisation.
[00:17:27] <johnbender> cool
