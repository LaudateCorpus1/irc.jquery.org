[06:55:47] <m_gol> so far El Captain beta works much better than Yosemite 10.10.5
[06:56:22] <m_gol> and as a bonus I don't have to have Safari 8 installed

[15:41:26] <wishie> so i have a project that includes http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js and it has stopped working on Safari 9 developer seeds.. I know its not generally accepted to post bug reports about beta software (either jquery or the browser) but I thought i would mention that its non-functional at all.
[16:24:44] <m_gol> wishie: Don't use http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js, it's frozen at 1.11.1
[16:25:33] <wishie> yeah, i read that 
[16:25:41] <m_gol> wishie: what do you mean by "not working", though? Have you tried jQuery 1.11.3 (http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.3.js) and the jQuery Compat development version? (http://code.jquery.com/jquery-compat-git.js)
[16:25:45] <wishie> so, i changed it to 2.1.4... worked.. so tried 1.11.3... worked
[16:25:51] <wishie> so i tried jquery-1.11.1 it worked..
[16:27:06] <m_gol> the link you provided is exactly jQuery 1.11.1 so it must be something else
[16:27:16] <wishie> thats what i thought
[16:27:39] <wishie> ill test some more
[16:28:59] <wishie> found it
[16:29:28] <wishie> ok, the issue seems to be with Safari 9 silently blocking http:// because the rest of the project is now using SSL
[16:29:44] <wishie> other browsers have no issue, and the current 'release' of Safari works
[16:30:02] <wishie> changing to https:// for the jquery include fixes it in the developer seed of Safari 9
[16:51:59] <wishie> why people dont just use // is beyond me
[16:57:07] <m_gol> wishie: I don't think using relative-protocol URLs makes sense nowadays
[16:57:12] <m_gol> just use https if available
[16:57:40] <m_gol> https scripts & content work fine on a http site; only in the other direction there might be a problem
[16:59:47] <wishie> this is the source of a purchased project
[16:59:50] <wishie> as in, i didnt write it
[17:00:17] <wishie> i think authors of such things should take into account how the end-user will use it
