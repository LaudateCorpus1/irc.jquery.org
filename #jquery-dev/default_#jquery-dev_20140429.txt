[00:55:44] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core 1.x Weekly build #26: STILL FAILING in 24 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201.x%20Weekly/26/
[07:02:06] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[07:02:19] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[07:02:43] <m_gol> I assume there is no easy way to discard all the data collected by jQuery from outside?
[07:03:02] <m_gol> I mean, if there is a lot of tests and each creates a jQuery object in a closure etc.
[07:03:03] <DaveMethvin> nope
[07:03:18] <DaveMethvin> also no way to clear .data() cache
[07:03:20] <m_gol> obviously they'll get gc'd but since Data is not a WeakMap yet, some data lingers
[07:04:00] <m_gol> k, can't wait for the WeakMap to arrive then ;)
[07:04:09] <DaveMethvin> if a user creates something in a closure we can't clear it anyway since their code owns it
[07:04:28] <m_gol> yeah
[07:04:44] <m_gol> but with 1.x you could dump stuff from $.cache
[07:05:01] <DaveMethvin> right, and you can sump the sizzle cache
[07:05:11] <m_gol> fortunately, WeakMap begins to be quite well supported now
[07:05:13] <DaveMethvin> all undocumented not supposed to do it stuff, of course :)
[07:05:21] <m_gol> ;)
[07:05:31] <DaveMethvin> weakmap is def the way to go
[07:06:50] <m_gol> we can't attach data to elements because of oldIE or are there other reasons as well?
[07:07:19] <DaveMethvin> just oldie i think, so we're going to try it again for 1.12 i hope
[07:07:43] <DaveMethvin> however, any special events still have to be torn down if they're in the subtree being discarded
[07:07:52] <m_gol> right
[07:08:20] <DaveMethvin> so ideally we'll just do the teardown and throw the rest away without any more processing
[07:08:33] <m_gol> yeah, I recall rwaldron had a patch for that
[10:05:41] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> I have ap roblem with my javascript using jquery. The idea is to read from a text file line by line and display inside the Latest News red box of demo3 the lines and make them scroll up. Instead each few seconds its adding another new Latest News red box with all the text content of the text file. And not scrolling up only 2 lines each time.

[10:05:41] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> You can see it on my site: http://newsxpressmedia.com/test.html
[10:05:41] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> Each some seconds a new red box with Latest News is adding like append with the whole text file content and its not scrolling. 
[10:05:41] <Sharperte> <Sharperte> Where is the problem with the code ?
[10:06:01] <DaveMethvin> Sharperte: #jquery please
