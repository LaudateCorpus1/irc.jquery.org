[05:56:18] <ajpiano> sweet wounded jeebus
[06:36:18] <jaubourg> ajpiano: you around
[06:36:19] <jaubourg> ?
[06:36:25] <ajpiano> i am indeed
[06:36:59] <jaubourg> so, I was thinking... how about I'm in berlin on Saturday October 1st and the land in boston Sunday morning?
[06:37:05] <jaubourg> the = then
[06:37:25] <ajpiano> whoa
[06:37:27] <ajpiano> sounds intense :D
[06:37:45] <jaubourg> just been thinking... with the time change, I would arrive at Boston at about the same time I would depart Berlin
[06:37:55] <jaubourg> yes it does
[06:37:56] <ajpiano> hahaha
[06:38:38] <jaubourg> but heh, if I'm taken for jsconf.eu (which is far from sure), and if I'm taken for jqcon boston (also not sure), maybe I could do something like this?
[06:39:15] <ajpiano> surely
[06:39:21] <jaubourg> just need to be able to deal with people of both confs...
[06:39:24] <jaubourg> that's the trick
[06:39:33] <ajpiano> well we are looking at talks later today
[06:39:40] <ajpiano> i will keep in mind that day is better for you :)
[06:39:41] <jaubourg> and I need to prepare two talks
[06:39:46] <ajpiano> day 2*
[06:39:48] <jaubourg> yep
[06:40:01] <jaubourg> since I intend to stay in Boston a bit after
[06:40:17] <jaubourg> ans squat the bocoup loft ;)
[06:40:20] <jaubourg> and
[06:40:22] <ajpiano> nice DD
[06:41:02] <jaubourg> I'll try and contact the jsconf.eu people and make sure that, if by any chance they're considering my talk, I'd need to talk on the first day
[06:41:26] <jaubourg> dunno why I didn't think of it earlier really
[06:41:34] <ajpiano> cause it's INSANE
[06:41:34] <ajpiano> :D
[06:42:23] <jaubourg> well, not in that order
[06:42:33] <jaubourg> the other way around would be insane with time change
[06:42:46] <ajpiano> haha for realll
[06:53:14] <jaubourg> ok, email sent to jsconf.eu
[12:58:26] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: What exactly did you want an opinion on? :)
[12:59:17] <DaveMethvin> do you feel like obama is handling the debt ceiling standoff appropriately?
[12:59:21] <DaveMethvin> oh no wait
[12:59:32] <DaveMethvin> it was about a patch submitted last night
[13:00:18] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/435
[13:03:47] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: not a half bad idea
[13:03:52] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: wrong place though
[13:04:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah more of a concept thing
[13:04:17] <gnarf> fx.custom() gets called for each property
[13:04:24] <gnarf> so its going to set a ton of timeouts
[13:04:45] <gnarf> but ensuring that at least one tick runs after the duration of the animation isn't a half bad idea
[13:05:05] <gnarf> no horrible side effects unless you're animating a ton of shit
[13:05:09] <DaveMethvin> if it keeps ppl from complaining, especially!
[13:05:27] <DaveMethvin> this guy's use case seemed reasonalbe
[13:05:29] <DaveMethvin> ble
[13:05:42] <gnarf> it really should be on $.fn.animate()
[13:05:43] <DaveMethvin> he has a comet connection updating stuff on the screen
[13:06:16] <DaveMethvin> and if rAF is in use it doesn't update correctly
[13:06:25] <DaveMethvin> it's a poker app
[13:06:30] <gnarf> when tabbed out right?
[13:06:33] <DaveMethvin> right
[13:07:36] <DaveMethvin> well if it doesn't seem crazy maybe we can do something like that
[13:08:27] <DaveMethvin> i have never dug into the animate stuff so i figured you would have an opinion that carried more weight
[13:11:03] <gnarf> its a little crazy
[13:12:25] <DaveMethvin> have we reached our quota of crazy in 1.7? :P
[13:14:44] <gnarf> honestly
[13:15:12] <gnarf> *shrug*
[13:15:18] <gnarf> im on the fence
[13:15:35] <gnarf> no matter where we put it, its going to create a few timer loops outisde of the animation frames
[13:16:46] <DaveMethvin> i actually like that rAF works the way it does, and clearly it saves cpu time when animations don't need to happen
[13:17:12] <DaveMethvin> but we have this implication that things will  happen after a certain amount of time regardless, like with .delay
[13:18:03] <gnarf> yeah, but is queuing up multiple setTimeouts that do the same job as the rAF a solution?
[13:18:19] <gnarf> if we could somehow tell fx.tick to only update one elements timers
[13:18:23] <DaveMethvin> hey that's what i was askin u :)
[13:18:25] <gnarf> that might make it make more sense
[13:19:33] <gnarf> or maybe fx.cleanup
[13:19:46] <gnarf> make a new function that only runs expired animations
[13:19:54] <gnarf> basically forcing them to end
[13:20:09] <gnarf> i'd be more interested in seeing this guys use case
[13:20:22] <gnarf> and see if I can't work around the rAF issue in restructuring the code
[13:20:30] <DaveMethvin> essentially for this guys' case it was like, "if not visible set to the end case, else animate"
[13:20:44] <DaveMethvin> rick put together a fiddle with the basic design
[13:20:48] <DaveMethvin> lemme find it
[13:20:54] <gnarf> its on the ticket
[13:20:56] <gnarf> I've seen it
[13:21:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah it just seems like it woudl be nice for the animation to do that
[13:21:16] <DaveMethvin> if the window wasn't visible
[13:21:25] <DaveMethvin> rather than make every user do it
[13:21:54] <gnarf> well, if we detected window visibility, we could even "fake" rAF
[13:22:07] <gnarf> in that our setInterval could pick up the same behavior
[13:22:32] <gnarf> i guess my wonder is if that blur/focus trick  actually detects it reliably
[13:22:39] <DaveMethvin> i wondered too
[13:22:49] <DaveMethvin> i have seen that trick used by some advertising
[13:23:00] <DaveMethvin> like if it makes you look at the ad for 15 secs
[13:23:01] <gnarf> my initial unresearched feeling is that it wont...
[13:23:14] <DaveMethvin> for ads of course it doesn't matter when it doesn't work
[13:26:31] <gnarf> hrm
[13:26:37] <gnarf> this might seem silly
[13:26:48] <gnarf> but if his "update" ran jQuery.fx.tick()
[13:27:38] <DaveMethvin> oh god, don't document that!
[13:27:45] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:27:48] <gnarf> :)
[13:28:05] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure that solves the problem tho
[13:28:33] <DaveMethvin> well it gets things going again, so yeah
[13:28:51] <gnarf> not literaly
[13:29:08] <gnarf> but it will update all the timers to the current frame
[13:29:17] <gnarf> if it was behind, it might take multiple queue runs
[13:29:48] <gnarf> honestly,
[13:30:34] <gnarf> I would suggest that he instead of animating the data in his "feed" - he instead stored the "current" in a var - and used an animation that had a callback to start the next update
[13:30:42] <gnarf> when you tab back in, you just get brought up to speed
[13:31:36] <gnarf> if we wanted to put in this setTimeout hack, I think it would be easier to make a flag that just forced interval instead of raF
[13:32:06] <DaveMethvin> as long as we have some general advice for people who are affected, it's just nice to point them somewhere showing them how to fix their code
[13:32:15] <gnarf> either we teach / educate how to properly decouple animations which may not actually run....
[13:33:04] <gnarf> and then we offer the jQuery.fx.noRAF = true or some bs
[13:33:28] <gnarf> as the "lazy" solution
[13:34:00] <DaveMethvin> i guess that's not such a bad flag since we have to avoid rAF on platforms where it isn't pressent
[13:34:03] <gnarf> or we end up undermining orAF
[13:34:27] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.fx.off :)
[13:34:34] <gnarf> yeah
[13:34:45] <gnarf> jQuery.fx.raf = false;
[13:35:00] <gnarf> and raf could actually be a support test basically :)
[13:35:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:35:30] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.burn.more.cpu
[13:35:42] <gnarf> the only weirdness would be making sure the flag could be enabled/disabled while in a rAF loop / setInterval loop
[13:36:15] <DaveMethvin> we could always document that it has to be set at ready before starting animations
[13:36:17] <gnarf> might actually need to make it a function :/
[13:36:23] <gnarf> DaveMethvin++
[13:36:54] <DaveMethvin> so we're saying, either design your app right or set this flag
[13:36:56] <DaveMethvin> :)
[13:37:04] <gnarf> right
[13:37:11] <DaveMethvin> but at least it's an easy flag to implemnt
[13:37:45] <gnarf> that could actually probably land in a 1.6.x release
[13:37:59] <DaveMethvin> assuming we have one before 1.7
[13:38:02] <gnarf> right
[13:38:17] <clarkbox> new view.jqueryui.com.... > https://204.45.118.122/jqview/
[13:38:43] <clarkbox> what do you guys think about having just dir browsing for nav?
[13:39:31] <DaveMethvin> well it's easy to do :P
[13:39:53] <gnarf> i could have a pull in like 20 minutes
[13:40:31] <DaveMethvin> if  you think it's a good idea, go ahead with a pull and we can discuss with interested parties
[13:40:40] <DaveMethvin> seems pretty harmless and simple
[13:40:46] <clarkbox> fyi - ^ danheberden put me up to that task for jqinfra...
[13:42:57] <gnarf> hrm
[13:43:05] <gnarf> raf: !!requestAnimationFrame
[13:43:15] <gnarf> or just raf: requestAnimationFrame
[13:43:53] <DaveMethvin> prolly bang-bang for cleanliness, i think all the .support properties are boolean
[13:43:57] <gnarf> i think its a better idea to add a flag to shut the raf off than to add an extra timeout to hack it
[13:44:12] <DaveMethvin> cool with me
[13:44:33] <DaveMethvin> unless you want to call it support.makeAnimationsCrappier
[13:45:54] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/compare/jquery:master...ticket_9381
[13:47:15] <gnarf> thats like +8 bytes in minified
[13:47:18] <gnarf> ohnoews
[13:48:30] <gnarf> "we highly suggest never using this flag, as it makes your animations much less friendly to your viewers CPU - especially when they aren't even looking at the page"
[13:49:01] <gnarf> I'll make sure to have a slide on rAF / setInterval
[13:49:10] <gnarf> if they let me speak @ jqconf ;)
[13:56:03] <gnarf> DaveMethvin / rwaldron: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/436
[13:56:09] <DaveMethvin> whew gnarf, did you break a sweat on that one? :)
[13:56:25] <gnarf> trying to write the pull description
[13:56:27] <gnarf> yeah
[13:56:36] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:56:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah needsdocs is the saddest word
[13:57:03] <gnarf> I feel that no matter how much we try to educate the best practices mentioned in the ticket, there will still be situations where the end user can't manage to set up the animation queueing properly. I think something like this flag should probably be pulled in during 1.7 or perhaps even a 1.6.x release if we end up doing another.
[13:57:10] <gnarf> i think that drove the point
[13:57:14] <DaveMethvin> right
[13:57:39] <DaveMethvin> sometimes simple hacks are the best
[14:01:37] <ajpiano> rwaldron: yt
[14:01:48] <rwaldron> sort of
[14:02:00] <rwaldron> whats up?
[14:04:13] <DaveMethvin> gotta go, thanks gnarf
[14:04:50] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/435#issuecomment-1588153 (commented on his pull too just to log my thoughts for future discussions)
[14:07:09] <gnarf> ?setInterval
[14:07:10] <bot-t> http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[14:09:28] <rwaldron> gnarf, I like your approach to this
[14:09:36] <gnarf> DaveMethvin / rwaldron another random idea approach - store the last "fxNow" value on jQuery.fx so you can compare it to +new Date()
[14:09:48] <rwaldron> meh
[14:09:57] <rwaldron> i like this super simple approach
[14:09:58] <gnarf> i make the same face
[14:10:12] <rwaldron> your 436 patch
[14:10:20] <rwaldron> i want rAF by default
[14:10:43] <rwaldron> opt-in to old style
[14:10:53] <gnarf> yeah
[14:10:59] <gnarf> i mean, like +8 bytes minified?
[14:11:10] <rwaldron> can you add a test somehow?
[14:11:17] <gnarf> i'll think on it
[14:11:22] <rwaldron> might be tricky
[14:11:25] <gnarf> yeah
[14:11:28] <rwaldron> but id like to see something
[14:11:31] <rwaldron> if possible
[14:11:33] <gnarf> lemme know if you get inspired on it too
[14:11:38] <rwaldron> still, i really like this
[14:11:41] <rwaldron> sooooo simple
[14:12:05] <gnarf> i guess we just never predicted people having this many problems (or rather >this< problem) :)
[14:12:47] <gnarf> i added another paragraph to the pull
[14:13:11] <rwaldron> my beef with the previous pull and the attitude about it was that we "broke" animate
[14:13:14] <rwaldron> which is absurd
[14:13:36] <gnarf> you've seen me defend it in docs#9381 already ;)
[14:13:37] <bot-t> [#9381] animations halt when the browser is out of focus due to requestAnimationFrame (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9381
[14:13:43] <rwaldron> ok, i'll be back shortly, have to drive rose to friends bachelorette party
[14:13:58] <gnarf> and like i said to DaveMethvin - kinda wish i was here to have discussed the right decoupling of data / animation queueing
[20:44:18] <jaubourg> ?tell JohnResig https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/371#issuecomment-1589018 this madness has to stop, I mean it. Still love you though ;)
[20:44:18] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[21:39:44] <timmywil> anyone have an idea why IE6 wouldn't do a throw 'error'; ?  I know it's reaching it.
[23:34:02] <gnarf> timmywil: yt?
[23:34:22] <timmywil> just about to go to bed
[23:34:36] <timmywil> wuzup
[23:34:52] <gnarf> dave and rick were asking for our opinions on a pull / docs#9381 related
[23:34:53] <bot-t> [#9381] animations halt when the browser is out of focus due to requestAnimationFrame (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9381
[23:35:05] <gnarf> just curious if you ever looked at it
[23:35:35] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/435 which inspired some discuss and https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/436
[23:36:02] <gnarf> no rush, just making sure your eyes had registered the link / backscroll ;)
[23:36:07] <gnarf> go to bed! :)
[23:36:22] <timmywil> yea i saw the flag.  I'm cool with that.  the setTimeout addition is clever, but still kind of misses of the point of raf
[23:36:33] <gnarf> right
[23:36:35] <gnarf> kinda my point
[23:37:01] <timmywil> anyways, talk more tomorrow :0
[23:37:03] <timmywil> :)
