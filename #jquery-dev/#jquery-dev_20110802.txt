[06:56:49] <louisremi> gnarf: Spent 1 hour looking at jQuery slideshow plugins. Most of them are poorly written, only 1 goes mad after being in an inactive tab too long.
[07:20:04] <DaveMethvin> louisremi: so that's good news I guess? Even the poorly written ones manage to not die! :)
[07:21:51] <DaveMethvin> Maybe we can add something to the animation() docs with some guidance? I've wanted to put together some technical blog entries to put somewhere about specific issues as well. kswedberg said we could use learn.jquery.com for that
[07:24:54] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: yeah for sure. you could write the article now so it'll be ready to post as soon as the site goes live. whenever that happens.
[07:25:29] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: is there an approx date? I have some stuff that could go up in a week or two
[07:25:43] <DaveMethvin> but it could wait 6 weeks as well
[07:25:55] <kswedberg> dunno. ajpiano is the guy to talk to about that.
[07:26:13] <DaveMethvin> k, he's been paged
[07:29:42] <akahn> Would y'all ever consider accepting a patch that made $.ajax take a `method` parameter in addition to `type`?
[07:31:13] <gnarf> DaveMethvin / louisremi: I'm definately mentioning this caveat in my talk @ jqcon
[07:32:12] <DaveMethvin> akahn: you mean, just an alias?
[07:32:28] <akahn> DaveMethvin: yes
[07:32:47] <DaveMethvin> well once you know that it's "type" you don't get it wrong again, right? :)
[07:33:03] <DaveMethvin> if i had a time machine i'd definitely fix that one though.
[07:33:09] <DaveMethvin> after i killed hitler
[07:33:14] <akahn> no, I get it wrong every time, because 'type' makes me think of content type. and I think of HTTP verbs as methods, like the spec says
[07:33:24] <akahn> and then i have to look it up ;)
[07:34:30] <akahn> my question remains
[07:35:01] <DaveMethvin> i doubt it's worth the extra parameter to $.ajax at this point ... often I wrap $.ajax in my own function to shorten the calls
[07:35:08] <DaveMethvin> you should think about doing that
[07:35:32] <akahn> yeah.
[07:36:10] <DaveMethvin> you can request it as a feature at bugs.jquery.com but it's not a critical change
[07:41:09] <akahn> what about a patch/pull request?
[09:06:12] <jaubourg> hi there
[09:13:52] <ben_alman> jaubourg, i had a friend with a question about jquery-jsonp
[09:14:01] <ben_alman> you around for a question?
[09:14:33] <jaubourg> yep
[09:14:35] <jaubourg> shoot
[09:14:39] <ben_alman> sec
[09:15:54] <ben_alman> jaubourg, jspath. jspath, jaubourg
[09:15:59] <jaubourg> hi
[09:16:07] <ben_alman> i used to work with jspath :)
[09:16:07] <jspath> hey
[09:16:29] <jaubourg> so, what seems to be the problem?
[09:16:33] <ben_alman> heh
[09:16:35] <ben_alman> like eliza
[09:16:36] * jaubourg puts his doctor outfit
[09:17:13] <jspath> so ... i noticed an intermittant problem with ie9 with jsonp in our app.  basically, jsonp requests start to fail or some reason.  this is ONLY IE9 ... and we cannot reproduce on our side.  but we know it's happening due to some logging we instituted.
[09:17:22] <jspath> when it occurs the jqXHR looks like { readyState => 4, status => 0, statusText => "error" }
[09:17:37] <jspath> and the error thrown is {  description => "Operation aborted\r\n",         message     => "Operation aborted\r\n",         number      => -2147467260,       }
[09:18:07] <jaubourg> same-domain or cross-domain?
[09:18:11] <jspath> cross
[09:18:38] <jspath> i was going to try editing the jquery source to use code from this page:
[09:18:38] <jspath> http://paulirish.com/2011/surefire-dom-element-insertion/
[09:18:47] <jaubourg> ok, so IE9 may have troubles with script tag injection
[09:19:31] <jspath> yeah ... I haven't narrowed it down enough yet to give you much useful information ... but it's definitely happening for soem number of IE9 users
[09:19:32] <jaubourg> and we do use insertBefore in script tag injection
[09:19:42] <jspath> yeah, i noticed
[09:19:49] <jaubourg> do you do this before the dom is ready?
[09:20:02] <jspath> no, this is far after the dom is ready
[09:20:24] <jspath> whats weird is that by the time the error occurs, we've already made some successful jsonp requests
[09:21:54] <jaubourg> hmmm, seems like some kind of edge condition being triggered, but if we don't have something reproducible, it'll be hell to know what happens
[09:21:55] <jspath> also ... the request never reaches the server ... presumably because the attempt to write the script tag fails
[09:22:07] <jaubourg> yeah, it's the injection that throws the exception
[09:22:11] <jaubourg> that much I can gather
[09:22:26] <jspath> yeah ... i told ben it wouldn't be that useful for me to report the issue yet ... since I haven't narrowed it down and can't reproduce
[09:22:29] <jaubourg> so the script tag is not injected, and the request is never done
[09:23:18] <jaubourg> I have to admit, I can't really help you with at least some, even half, reproducible test case
[09:23:25] <jaubourg> without
[09:23:38] <ben_alman> ie sux
[09:23:39] <jspath> yeah, i totally understand :)
[09:23:51] <jspath> if I manage to produce one i'll def let you know
[09:24:32] <jaubourg> yeah, do so, but I never heard of this problem so there may be some condition in your app that triggers this
[09:24:48] <jaubourg> (just to give some pointers as to where to look at)
[09:25:22] <jaubourg> what kind of logging are you doing?
[09:25:26] <jspath> yep ... unfortunately the only way we can get info on the problem is to run live traffic through tests
[09:26:36] <jspath> i use the error callback and build some error information into an object and append a pixel to the body with the information in the query string as JSON encoded data ... then i look in the server logs
[09:26:38] <jspath> fun stuff :)
[09:30:43] <jaubourg> hehe, anyway, I gotta fly but keep me posted
[09:30:52] <jaubourg> If we have a bug, I wanna squash it ;)
