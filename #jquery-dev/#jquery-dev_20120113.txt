[08:35:44] <gnarf> crazy
[08:35:53] <gnarf> If your code is very hand-optimized concerning var declarations, this lifting variable declarations might actually increase size. For me it helps out. On jQuery it adds 865 bytes (243 after gzip). YMMV. Also note that (since it’s not enabled by default) this operation isn’t yet heavily tested (please report if you find issues!).
[08:36:10] <gnarf> thats with the --lift-vars on uglify
