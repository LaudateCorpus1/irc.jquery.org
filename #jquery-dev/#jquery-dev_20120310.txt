[08:38:03] <mikesherov> danheberden: did you ever enable my ssh key for the bugs.jquery.com trac box
[08:38:04] <mikesherov> ?
[08:47:29] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell danheberden did you ever enable my ssh key for the bugs.jquery.com trac box?
[08:47:29] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[08:49:06] <jaubourg> hey mike
[08:49:14] <mikesherov> hey jaubourg
[08:49:32] <mikesherov> Did you accidentally close my ticket 11004?
[08:49:41] <jaubourg> ??
[08:49:49] <jaubourg> ?#11004
[08:49:50] <bot-t> [#11004] getWH incorrectly removes padding and border width when box-sizing is border-box (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/11004
[08:50:07] <mikesherov> on the ticket history, the ticket was still open, but someone named "jaudourg" had closed it
[08:50:11] <mikesherov> or so it seemed
[08:50:19] <jaubourg> never touched this one
[08:50:22] <mikesherov> I deleted the comment, because it was weird
[08:50:28] <mikesherov> OK, weird
[08:50:31] <jaubourg> "jaudourg" with a d?
[08:50:34] <mikesherov> YES
[08:50:35] <mikesherov> LOL
[08:50:37] <jaubourg> lol
[08:50:55] <mikesherov> Having a nice weekend so far?
[08:51:00] <jaubourg> whatever you're drinking/smoking right now, I want some ;) :P
[08:51:10] <mikesherov> HAHA
[08:51:30] <jaubourg> yeah, got some work to do for a client, like experimentation or something
[08:51:43] <jaubourg> since my gf's got to work tonight, I'll take the opportunity
[08:52:14] <mikesherov> sneaking in programming whenever the lady is away
[08:52:24] <mikesherov> Exactly what I'm doing right now
[08:52:35] <jaubourg> hehe
[09:14:23] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov jaubourg: yeah i notice something is really strange with a bunch of tix, it says "jaudourg" closed them but they are open?
[09:14:41] <mikesherov> Yes
[09:14:54] <mikesherov> I just deleted the comment on mine
[09:15:06] <DaveMethvin> was jaubourg duplicated as an evil twin in some strange transporter malfunction?
[09:15:11] <DaveMethvin> i saw a show about that once
[09:15:18] <mikesherov> It didn't actually effect the ticket
[09:15:30] <DaveMethvin> right, even more strange
[09:15:37] <mikesherov> Let me look... dave, do you have another example
[09:15:48] <DaveMethvin> lemme look
[09:16:46] <mikesherov> it could be someone just trolling us, and making comments that are trac formatted to look like they are actions taken on tickets, but not really
[09:16:55] <mikesherov> and using a name similar to one of the team members
[09:17:11] <mikesherov> jaubourg: have you made an mortal enemies recently
[09:17:20] <mikesherov> any*
[09:17:22] <DaveMethvin> oh mikesherov i think that may be it
[09:17:27] <DaveMethvin> the formatting IS a bit off
[09:17:34] <mikesherov> example, dave?
[09:17:41] <DaveMethvin> still looking
[09:17:49] <mikesherov> hit edit on the comment and you can tell
[09:17:49] <DaveMethvin> i just notice the formatting was askew
[09:18:46] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5133
[09:19:10] <DaveMethvin> this report is good for finding them, they happened around 10-15 hours ago: http://bugs.jquery.com/query?changetime=5daysago..&report=301&desc=1&order=changetime
[09:19:25] <mikesherov> right, it's a troll
[09:19:54] <mikesherov> if you hit edit on a comment that has an actual action, you can only edit the comment, not the actions
[09:20:14] <mikesherov> on all those, it's HTML formatted to look like an action
[09:20:24] <mikesherov> the dead giveaway is the identation, and hitting edit
[09:20:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and it's still going, could be a bot
[09:20:49] <DaveMethvin> which is really annoying
[09:21:01] <DaveMethvin> we can delete the account though, and all its posts
[09:21:21] <DaveMethvin> but of course someone can come back and do it with another account
[09:21:29] <mikesherov> annoying
[09:22:01] <mikesherov> this is why we can't have nice things
[09:22:49] <DaveMethvin> yup
[09:24:12] <DaveMethvin> we can get danheberden to wipe that jaudourg guy and all his posts ... just need to be sure he doesn't accidentally type jaubourg!
[09:25:03] <mikesherov> hahaha
[09:58:57] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: got a sec?
[09:59:07] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:59:22] <mikesherov> jQuery.access, I've never fully understood how that works...
[10:00:15] <DaveMethvin> well conceptually it's simple at least :)
[10:00:28] <DaveMethvin> it's the details that get hairy
[10:00:51] <mikesherov> First param is a context, second is a callback with three params, third is the second param for the callback, fourth is third param in the callback...
[10:01:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah the args are a little funny when gibson042 refactored
[10:01:21] <DaveMethvin> but since it's an internal call i didn't sweat it too much
[10:01:52] <DaveMethvin> i'd have to go back to re-figure it all myself
[10:02:00] <mikesherov> OK
[10:02:11] <mikesherov> but basically, I have those first 4 correct, right?
[10:02:18] <DaveMethvin> lemme look
[10:03:03] <mikesherov> Thanks for the help
[10:03:42] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah now i remember kinda
[10:04:31] <DaveMethvin> the pass arg confused me the most on this, it existed before that refactor
[10:04:40] <DaveMethvin> but i have to remember why it confused me
[10:05:07] <mikesherov> don't sweat it too much, I was just wondering about it, and if you had a quick explanation
[10:06:27] <DaveMethvin> mainly it's tryna consolidate all the crap for checking if the arg is a fn/object/undefined
[10:06:41] <DaveMethvin> man i wish we had been hardass from the beginning about that stuff
[10:09:04] <DaveMethvin> so mikesherov did you have a specific q?
[10:09:20] <mikesherov> just about the first 4 params, if I got those right
[10:09:50] <mikesherov> it seems if you pass null as third param, the callback only expects 1 param, the fourth param of access
[10:10:01] <mikesherov> and doesn't pass in elem
[10:10:04] <mikesherov> so I got it
[10:10:21] <mikesherov> was just wondering if there was any other black magic I needed to be aware of
[10:10:49] <DaveMethvin> just walking thru that case
[10:11:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah if there's no key then it's a bulk operation basically
[10:13:11] <DaveMethvin> so like .text()
[10:24:07] <mikesherov> Thanks
[10:46:00] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: jaudourg is one of those wtf moments
[10:46:17] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: who on earth would come up with something that stupid?
[10:50:01] <mikesherov> LOL

[10:50:27] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: that's why I was asking about jQuery.access
[10:50:33] <mikesherov> it's a tiny code change.
[10:52:09] <mikesherov> 25% speed boost though: http://jsperf.com/jquery-style-vs-css-optimization
