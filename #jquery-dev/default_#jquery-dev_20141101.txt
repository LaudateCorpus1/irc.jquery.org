[01:19:36] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core Compat Periodic build #107: STILL UNSTABLE in 21 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%20Compat%20Periodic/107/
[01:19:36] <doesallmagic2> * m.goleb: Deprecated: Drop size and andSelf methods
[01:19:37] <doesallmagic2> * m.goleb: Test: Switch leftover andSelf to addBack
[01:19:37] <doesallmagic2> * Timmy Willison: Change broken url to wayback one
[01:19:38] <doesallmagic2> * m.goleb: README: Update the description of the deprecated module
[08:01:04] <m_gol> jsFiddle is useless in IE8 :(
[08:05:29] <m_gol> even the preview, argh
[08:06:12] <m_gol> I just don't get it; a site designed specifically to be able to recreate demos for e.g. browser bugs doesn't even have a working preview in IE8
[08:27:15] <arschmitz> m_gol: thats why i use jsbin
[08:27:24] <m_gol> is there an embed URL there?
[08:27:29] <arschmitz> yes
[08:27:31] <m_gol> fully without decoration?
[08:27:47] <arschmitz> its frameless but has a little hover link
[08:27:57] <arschmitz> though i think there is even a link to remove that i just cant remember
[08:28:48] <m_gol> I don't see a link to a non-frame version in the share menu, how to get to it?
[08:28:59] <arschmitz> there is a little arrow
[08:29:02] <arschmitz> or just remove edit
[08:29:06] <arschmitz> from the url
[08:29:55] <m_gol> cool
[08:30:23] <arschmitz> m_gol: i know there is a link to remove the floating link i just cant remember and i dont think its documented
[08:30:27] <m_gol> I don't see anything relevant under an arrow there
[08:30:36] <m_gol> I had to manually remove "edit" from the URL
[08:30:38] <m_gol> where is it?
[08:30:47] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/sumudu/1/edit?html,js,output
[08:30:55] <arschmitz> do you see a small black arrow just under help?
[08:31:00] <m_gol> yeah, even if the floating breaks then at least the site is not in a frame
[08:31:25] <m_gol> ah, this :)
[08:31:39] <arschmitz> m_gol: i think you have to make changes before it shows up
[08:31:51] <m_gol> we should change our recommendation from jsFiddle to jsBin to our bug reporters
[08:32:10] <m_gol> one drawback is that one has to create an account before having this preview option
[08:32:14] <m_gol> but at least it exists
[08:32:20] <arschmitz> m_gol: did you see this weeks dev leads notes
[08:32:21] <m_gol> which I cannot say about jsFiddle
[08:32:46] <arschmitz> m_gol: we are working on something with jsbin already 
[08:32:50] <m_gol> ok, great!
[08:33:02] <arschmitz> m_gol: iv been talking to remy 
[08:33:13] <arschmitz> m_gol: and we are going to be setting up things like jquery.jsbin.com
[08:33:19] <arschmitz> and jquerymobile.jsbin.com
[08:33:29] <arschmitz> with default templates and stuff
[08:33:43] <arschmitz> m_gol: similar to http://ember.jsbin.com
[08:34:05] <arschmitz> m_gol: i mean http://emberjs.jsbin.com/?html,css,js,output
[08:35:51] <m_gol> that will be a huge improvement to what we have now :)
[08:36:41] <arschmitz> m_gol: we are also talking about turning our demos and examples to be embeded jsbins
[08:36:53] <arschmitz> m_gol: so you can clickingto them and edit / play with them
[08:37:21] <arschmitz> m_gol: it will be a while though
[08:37:26] <m_gol> I can imagine :)
