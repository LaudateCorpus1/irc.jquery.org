[03:13:42] <jqcommit> [api.qunitjs.com] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/39O_wQ
[03:13:42] <jqcommit> [api.qunitjs.com/master] Document QUnit.log as a reference. Use <options> to list details properties - Jörn Zaefferer
[03:15:43] <jzaefferer> ?tell rwaldron could use your help on QUnit docs once more. I prepared QUnit.log as a reference - https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com/issues/3
[03:15:44] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[04:53:04] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: I can't repro those unit test fails in core
[04:53:24] <DaveMethvin> IE8, i've tried in both browserstack and my own vm
[04:53:28] <DaveMethvin> no offset fails
[04:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Does core's test suite support any values for version= besides min?
[04:54:49] <DaveMethvin> i can't remember, let me look
[04:55:47] <DaveMethvin> i think it's only min atm
[04:55:54] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: are you running the same ?module=offset filter?
[04:56:09] <scott_gonzalez> Are there plans for other versions in the future?
[04:56:16] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: yes
[04:56:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm wondering if I can change it from version=min to min=true
[04:56:20] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: let me try that
[04:56:33] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: just did, works fine :/
[04:56:47] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: does testswarm run the tests in another iframe?
[04:56:56] <DaveMethvin> i think ie has some measurement issues with iframes
[04:57:10] <jzaefferer> Yeah, that's a good guess
[04:57:16] <jzaefferer> TestSwarm runs tests in iframes
[04:58:04] <jzaefferer> just five assertions that are each off by one pixel
[04:58:07] <jzaefferer> so close..
[04:58:08] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Will the veresions be numbered versions or modular builds?
[04:59:07] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: not sure ... at one point some of the tests had the ability to use jquery=min but we did a bunch of rework and pulled it out
[04:59:31] <scott_gonzalez> Would it be ok to switch to min=true?
[04:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like even with other versions you might want to run against source or min.
[05:00:07] <DaveMethvin> well version can give the full file name
[05:00:16] <DaveMethvin> including ".min"
[05:01:22] <DaveMethvin> i dunno i'd prefer to wait until we do the full change than commit to min=true now
[05:01:33] <DaveMethvin> unless you are okay with it possibly going away?
[05:01:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine if it goes away.
[05:02:13] <DaveMethvin> just seems simpler to give either a keyword (e.g. "git") or the whole file name
[05:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> I saw Timmy's commit for qSA and saw that you're parsing configs yourself.
[05:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> Well, using a keyword would require the code to be changed anyway.
[05:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> I can keep version=min and just update the parsing.
[05:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> I can add git too, but that doesn't seem useful
[05:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> Since that's what you're already testing :-)
[05:03:54] <DaveMethvin> we wanted to be able to run current unit tests against other versions, but yes git is kind of, um, useless
[05:04:10] <DaveMethvin> that is, IF THE GIT BUILD EVER GOT BUILT
[05:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[05:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> So, one thing to consider is that you'll need to know whether to reach out somewhere else.
[05:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> So that's either special-casing version values to know to use /dist.
[05:05:06] <scott_gonzalez> Or only using version to point somewhere else (like code.jquery)
[05:05:24] <DaveMethvin> that's what we had earlier
[05:05:44] <DaveMethvin> it was code.jquery.com unless it started with http in which case all bets are off
[05:07:43] <scott_gonzalez> So based on your earlier question are you ok with min=true for now since that's all that's supported?
[05:07:57] <scott_gonzalez> And we can change it again later when you figure out what you want to do with versions?
[05:08:06] <DaveMethvin> sure
[05:09:14] <scott_gonzalez> Can I change qsa=no to noqsa=true?
[05:09:30] <scott_gonzalez> These changes bring the configs inline with how QUnit works internally.
[05:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> It makes the implementation simpler and the integration better.
[05:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> You'll actually get checkboxes in the header for free.
[05:10:13] <jzaefferer> FOR FREE
[05:10:29] <jzaefferer> also DaveMethvin, I'm close to fixing the -git build for UI. Can then apply the same thing for Core
[05:10:36] <jzaefferer> Jenkins will take care ;)
[05:10:45] <DaveMethvin> FREE FREE FREE!!!!
[05:11:01] <DaveMethvin> and anything that satisfies jenkins is good
[05:11:33] <jzaefferer> You relationship with Jenkins is seriously damaged
[05:12:48] <DaveMethvin> it can be saved
[05:17:05] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: i don't recall these errors until recently so i am suspecting some recent change in testswarm
[05:17:19] <DaveMethvin> for example the iframe is now centered
[05:17:24] <DaveMethvin> and it's resized by script: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/js/result.js#L10
[05:17:56] <DaveMethvin> that seems like it might interfere in general with something the tested software may be doing
[05:22:32] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: okay. No idea why Krinkle changed that.
[05:22:46] <jzaefferer> Actually
[05:22:54] <jzaefferer> This is just the results display, no what runs the tests
[05:22:59] <jzaefferer> So that shouldn't matter at all
[05:23:15] <jzaefferer> The code is not good, but does not affect the runner
[05:23:21] <DaveMethvin> so do you know where the code is that injects the iframe that runs the test?
[05:23:30] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to look at the commit history for that
[05:23:41] <jzaefferer> that's here: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/js/run.js
[05:23:53] <jzaefferer> well, thats the script for the runner
[05:24:00] <jzaefferer> iframe creation ...
[05:24:39] <jzaefferer> actually in run.js: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/js/run.js#L161
[05:25:19] <DaveMethvin> ah ok
[05:26:00] <jzaefferer> that's been a while: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/commit/be28299a3300eddb057c8e1b6597e0efa32d3fbd#L4R139
[05:26:01] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on testswarm by Krinkle (2m, 1w ago): Remove GetrunPage, using api.php?action=getrun / saverun  - API implemented in #115  - inject.js DEBUG, logging url instead of form.innerHTML   the innerHTML is redundant with the earlier log of `params`,   the url is more useful.
[05:26:20] <jzaefferer> fixed dimensions since 2 months
[05:26:51] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: you're good, you know that?
[05:26:54] <jzaefferer> also had the same dimensions before that
[05:27:12] <jzaefferer> maybe some css changed
[05:27:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah, where is that css located
[05:27:24] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: awww ...
[05:27:29] <jaubourg> :)
[05:28:05] <jzaefferer> class=test-runner-frame, but doesn't show up here https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/css/testswarm.css
[05:28:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah i didn't see it either
[05:29:13] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/827
[05:29:14] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by scottgonzalez ( ago): Use QUnit's URL configs to simplify custom configuration.
[05:29:23] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: cool
[05:29:54] <DaveMethvin> i have to walk the dog, then load up the tshirts and run down to rworth's house
[05:30:29] <DaveMethvin> i'll be back here for the 2pm mtg, then do some actual coding after that
[05:33:35] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: was the change to noqsa=true to match up with qunit's parsing? i don't know if timmywil has some other scripts that depend on that
[05:33:47] <DaveMethvin> prolly should check with him
[05:33:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's how the checkboxes work.
[05:34:26] <DaveMethvin> he'll prolly like the checkbox but just want to be sure he sees this change
[05:36:16] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: land this if you want, looks good to me
[05:36:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll wait for timmywil just in case.
[05:41:15] <DaveMethvin> ok, dog walking time
[05:50:58] <jzaefferer> ?tell Krinkle we could use your help debugging the IE8/offset test failures - suspecting IE-iframe issue, as its not reproducable outside of TestSwarm
[05:51:04] <jzaefferer> ah, not bot

[07:42:04] <timmywil> I thought you might notice that before I had a chance to fix it :)
[07:49:14] <jzaefferer> ?tell DaveMethvin look, a new -git build, from Jenkins: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js - headers should get an update, that's all in your grunt.js though
[07:49:15] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[08:25:30] <timmywil> gibson042: yea, I guess we can't get around arrays in checkSet
[08:25:47] <timmywil> oh well
[08:26:30] <timmywil> it's accurate, but I guess it's the downside of a right-to-left strategy
[08:34:41] <jaubourg> scott_gonzalez: nicely played with the url
[08:41:15] <scott_gonzalez> jaubourg: Thanks. The automatic checkbox stuff is really cool and has existed for a while.
[08:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> I added QUnit.urlParams a while ago because we do a bunch of parsing in jQuery UI and QUnit already needed to parse stuff anyway.
[08:49:01] <gibson042> timmywil: let me know if there's anything I can do to help
[08:49:32] <timmywil> gibson042: I'll ask you to check me when I push this

[13:13:03] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: any thoughts on those failing core unit tests?
[13:14:09] <DaveMethvin> it looks like some new ones cropped up, but i am more worried about the 5 in IE8 relating to offset
[13:14:27] <DaveMethvin> i just tried a simple test locally running that test in an iframe, it passed
[13:15:08] <timmywil> i noticed that too. According to swarm, they started with a commit to grunt: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1ea4fe705207476698e7768036343b2ebe3bb31f, but idk.
[13:15:09] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by Jörn Zaefferer (1d, 21h ago): Grunt: Update testswarm task to use new module filter, reduces duplication when running, should speed things up
[13:16:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah that has GOT to be coincidental timmywil
[13:16:22] <Krinkle> can you be more specific? what are you talking about
[13:17:05] <DaveMethvin> lemme find the test run Krinkle
[13:17:05] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: running the offset tests in browserstack seems to pass in both compability and not
[13:17:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah i noticed
[13:17:27] <DaveMethvin> and i made a test page with an iframe that it works in too
[13:17:45] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/26
[13:17:50] <DaveMethvin> that was the run that was SOOOOOO close
[13:17:59] <DaveMethvin> and i could not repro the fails
[13:18:56] <timmywil> they're all 1 pixel off, that probably means something
[13:19:01] <Krinkle> timmywil: your sizzle update to jquery core broke FF12 on the swarm
[13:19:18] <Krinkle> timmywil: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/5268
[13:19:58] <DaveMethvin> the ones in job 26 worry me b/c they seem to only happen in swarm and i can't repro
[13:19:59] <Krinkle> hm.. time out
[13:19:59] <Krinkle> hold on, I am in a meeting - I'll get back to y'all in a few minutes
[13:20:02] <timmywil> i noticed those. I can't repro that either, tho I'm on FF 13.
[13:20:03] <DaveMethvin> k np
[13:20:13] <DaveMethvin> GAAH
[13:20:28] <DaveMethvin> oh lemme see if i have updated yet
[13:20:53] <DaveMethvin> oh firefox, too quick for me
[13:20:59] <DaveMethvin> i'm on 13 too
[13:21:11] <timmywil> lemme browserstack it
[13:21:47] <timmywil> FF12 in browserstack is also passing
[13:26:28] <timmywil> FF12 and Opera 11.5 in testswarm look like timer issues. Maybe a timeout is being forced too early?
[13:26:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah i dunno
[13:27:07] <DaveMethvin> it seems like the remaining ones only can be repro on swarm
[13:27:15] <DaveMethvin> so it may be something we changed in our code
[13:27:21] <DaveMethvin> or it could be swarm code
[13:27:33] <DaveMethvin> but we may need to somehow git bisect both
[13:27:43] <DaveMethvin> don't really want to debug that in master tho :D
[13:31:01] <timmywil> Looks like it's not running the latest commit. Is that because there weren't any changes to src or is it down?
[13:40:31] <timmywil> Obviously Krinkle knows better, but I notice that in http://swarm.jquery.org/js/inject.js, submitTimeout is set to 5 sec. Some tests may take a little longer, especially in queue and effects, but those tests haven't been changed recently.
[13:43:25] <Krinkle> timmywil: that's not relevant
[13:43:38] <timmywil> ok, wasn't sure if it was
[13:43:47] * Krinkle is back
[13:44:02] <Krinkle> looking up ..
[13:44:18] <timmywil> wish I could reproduce. FF12 on browserstack running queue tests from swarm passes.
[13:44:33] <Krinkle> timmywil: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/data/testrunner.js#L25
[13:44:37] <Krinkle> 20 seconds
[13:44:54] <Krinkle> between every stop() and start()
[13:45:03] <Krinkle> (or asyncTest() and start())
[13:45:11] <timmywil> yea, didn't know if maybe testswarm timed out as well
[13:45:30] <Krinkle> timmywil: testswarm currently never times out, I've gotten rid of that last week
[13:45:37] <Krinkle> the browser now keeps pinging the swarm telling it is alive
[13:45:49] <timmywil> cool
[13:45:49] <Krinkle> as long as the dom is not dead, it will not time out
[13:46:17] <Krinkle> as for inject.js, there is an overal limit for the entire test suite though
[13:46:43] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/config/testswarm-defaults.json#L25
[13:46:48] <Krinkle> conf.client.runTimeout
[13:46:53] <Krinkle> 180s by default,
[13:46:56] <Krinkle> set to 300s on swarm.jquery.org
[13:47:22] <Krinkle> so basically the <iframe> on swarm/run/[username] is killed after 300s if QUnit.end has not fired
[13:47:32] <timmywil> gotch
[13:48:23] <timmywil> the queue and effects fails seem timer related, but that's the best I got.
[13:48:50] <Krinkle> yep
[13:49:04] <Krinkle> Qunit is not getting a start() when it wants to, so it moves on to the next test
[14:01:02] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #145: STILL FAILING in 23 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/145/
[14:01:02] <jq-jenkins> timmywillisn: Update Sizzle: Removes an unnecessary link in the test suite
[14:04:07] <timmywil> that's funny. That commit didn't change any code but IE7 picked up an effects fail.
[14:04:30] <timmywil> and ff12
[14:04:46] <DaveMethvin> that's NOT funny :/
[14:05:03] <timmywil> no. no I suppose not. :P
[14:05:14] <DaveMethvin> lol yeah i knew you'd come around to my position
[14:05:24] <timmywil> you're very persuasive
[14:05:33] <timmywil> I'm working on quickIs now btw
[14:05:33] <DaveMethvin> well, but it IS ie7
[14:05:36] <DaveMethvin> oh good
[14:06:12] <Krinkle> maybe ie7 just has a bad hair day
[14:06:32] <Krinkle> or a cold
[14:06:36] <Krinkle> it seems to be spreading
[14:06:41] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery
[14:07:32] <DaveMethvin> http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pqaj5/
[14:08:21] <DaveMethvin> oh man we were so close
[14:08:28] <DaveMethvin> these seem like the timing-related fails
[14:08:37] <Krinkle> nope
[14:08:48] <Krinkle> at least not timing-related as in 'too slow'
[14:09:06] <Krinkle> the new ie7 error that timmywil 's trivial sizzle update caused: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/5627
[14:09:11] <Krinkle> "4. Margin left is not 200 after partial animate"
[14:09:15] <Krinkle> Result: 200
[14:09:32] <DaveMethvin> that is a new test too
[14:10:00] <Krinkle> could be internally timing related (jQuery firing the callback too soon) - but not QUnit or TestSwarm timing
[14:10:10] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: maybe, but not introduced by timmywil removing an <a> from the qunit header xD
[14:10:35] <DaveMethvin> well you know  how those animations are, they likey the linky
[14:10:40] <timmywil> in the Sizzle index.html too, not jQuery's
[14:10:57] <Krinkle> lol, yeah
[14:11:03] <DaveMethvin> Sense. this makes none.
[14:11:14] <Krinkle> Where's jzaefferer hanging out?
[14:19:34] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: poing
[14:20:48] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: great :)
[14:20:56] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: so I was thinking a few things that I wanted your feedback on
[14:21:13] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: in no particular order, lets start with the email you sent regarding the frame issue
[14:21:26] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: which failure is that?
[14:25:34] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I was talking about this: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/30
[14:25:44] <jzaefferer> apparently it got worse though: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/34
[14:26:00] <jzaefferer> but those 12 offset failures still exist
[14:26:08] <Krinkle> right
[14:26:15] <Krinkle> so what I was thinking... what about window.open() ?
[14:26:33] <Krinkle> (instead of <iframe>) on the RunPage
[14:26:45] <Krinkle> how does that behave cross-browser, and can we make all the cross-context calls we need to make?
[14:27:04] <Krinkle> window.parent isn't going to work..
[14:28:22] <jzaefferer> as long as its on the same domain, it should have the same access as an iframe
[14:28:34] <jzaefferer> and a separate window could be more reliable
[14:30:59] <Krinkle> exactly
[14:31:11] <Krinkle> although it can potentially "go" crazy and out of bounds
[14:31:33] <Krinkle> js can close windows it opened, right?
[14:31:39] <Krinkle> lets investigate this
[14:32:27] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, does it make sense to have (bi) weekly meetings in #jquery-meeting for qunit+testswarm (and related npm modules maintained by jquery members)
[14:33:06] <jzaefferer> yeah, bi-weekly sounds good
[14:33:26] <jzaefferer> I've been doing random QUnit meetings, but bi-weekly covering both QUnit+TestSwarm makes sense
[14:33:34] * Krinkle nod
[14:33:38] <jzaefferer> increases the odds that more than two people show up
[14:33:51] <Krinkle> hehe
[14:34:04] <jzaefferer> I'll be in SF for three weeks starting Wednesday, afterwards I'd be happy to organize those
[14:34:27] <jzaefferer> not that I will be completely offline, but would focus on some essentials
[14:34:38] <jzaefferer> before the conference: UI 1.9 beta and sites launch
[14:34:44] <clarkbox> if you keep in mind that I'm on west coast, i can join. hint… after 10am pst
[14:35:50] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: well, that's just it. it ain't always on the same server, hence we need inject.js
[14:36:18] <Krinkle> window.parent isn't restricted to origin, only from parent to child
[14:36:32] <Krinkle> sorry, just realized that now
[14:36:38] <Krinkle> (half-way writing an issue on gh)
[14:45:33] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: did you use the attributes property in quickIs because of attroperties?
[14:45:48] <timmywil> I think I actually suggested it, but did it also have to with xml?
[14:46:29] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i can't completely remember, it was in response to a bug filed though so most likely attroperties cam into play
[14:46:58] <timmywil> kk

[15:12:48] <Krinkle> are all past versions in the repo?
[15:13:00] <Krinkle> (relative path, not code.jquery.com
[15:13:17] <jzaefferer> not all, just plenty
[15:14:13] <Krinkle> ah, I see them now
[15:14:50] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: the query is causing the issue
[15:15:29] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/build/jquery-ui/c9ff92a00876b7455a641bb6e5e11d19e4dc3688/tests/jquery-1.6.3?nojshint.js
[15:15:40] <Krinkle> ?nojshint
[15:16:06] <Krinkle> you found it
[15:16:08] <Krinkle> :D
[15:17:29] <jzaefferer> yeah, the double question mark
[15:17:58] <jzaefferer> I really didn't want to write some indexof(?) == −1 ? "?" : "&" crap :/
[15:31:18] <Krinkle> well, not the double question make, the fact that there was one there at all. it was inserted half-way a path
[15:31:32] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, the other thing I wanted to get your feedback on
[15:31:52] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I want to make it so that we don't need extensive code for 'testswarm task' in all repositories
[15:32:10] <Krinkle> one of the things bothering me is the manual reconstruction of each module() call / file
[15:32:20] <Krinkle> can we automate that?
[15:32:37] <Krinkle> we should be able to get that at jenkins after the headless webkit qunit run, right ?
[15:32:55] <Krinkle> simply get list of modules and make index.html?module= modules[i]
[15:33:07] <Krinkle> (except for jquery-ui which has separate html files)
[15:48:12] <jzaefferer> we could probably get the repo url from package.json
[15:48:15] <jzaefferer> to construct the anchor
[15:48:39] <jzaefferer> and yeah, some globbing for the tests would also help
[15:48:50] <jzaefferer> reusing the qunit config property seems reasonable
[15:50:12] <Krinkle> basically reduce the grunt part to "call node-testswarm and pass it a json file"
[15:50:13] <Krinkle> jzaefferer:
[15:50:30] <Krinkle> and/or other cli parameters
[15:51:42] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, I was having a conversation with someone about js continuous integration a few hours ago and he randomly inserted at some point "[..] so basically we can get rid of testswarm, wouldn't that be one less burden (aside from the work that has gone into it).."
[15:52:03] <Krinkle> I won't name his name (since it was a private convo), but it kept me thinking
[15:52:18] <Krinkle> I was looking at Yeti at the time
[15:53:01] <Krinkle> basically what it does: it takes a test suite, and pops it up from a web server (running on node even) which basically is just like the testswarm run page and aggregates test results back up, and thats it.
[15:53:32] <Krinkle> whatever browser can access that url gets to join it
[15:53:39] <jzaefferer> okay
[15:53:44] <Krinkle> http://www.yuiblog.com/blog/2010/08/25/introducing-yeti-the-yui-easy-testing-interface/
[15:53:57] <Krinkle> and when it thinks it has enough it kills it
[15:54:24] <Krinkle> the "enough" can e.g. be spawning off browserstack workers from the same script, and when it has received reports for the matching browsers, its done
[15:54:48] <Krinkle> it does mean we won't have a php web app to browser through everthing
[15:54:50] <Krinkle> b
[15:55:15] <Krinkle> but we can still have everything else: aggregates test results as JSON, and if we want to even save the DOM somewhere (like we do now)
[15:55:22] <Krinkle> except that we need a place to store it
[15:56:04] <Krinkle> I'm currently looking at Bunyip which seems nice, except too simple and too much focussed on a very narrow use case, but the general idea is nice
[15:56:07] <Krinkle> and you can use it locally
[15:56:32] <Krinkle> e.g. to pop it up in Chrome and whatever other browsers you have (pre-commit).
[15:56:57] <Krinkle> a node script that you pass the current directory and a set of browsers
[15:58:07] <Krinkle> and get back reports from the browsers (the script publishes the did, spawns off browsers to its run-page url in which the different test frameworks are detected (jasmine, qunit, ..), aggregated, and send back up through ajax, ending up in your CLI - or the Jenkins CLI)
[15:58:24] <Krinkle> did*directory
[15:58:59] <Krinkle> let me think this through for the weekend, and we'll talk at the meeting next week
[16:01:41] <jzaefferer> okay
[16:06:10] <Krinkle> It looks like Yeti is more similar to TestSwarm than I thought: https://github.com/yui/yeti/wiki/Yeti-Cocktails
[16:09:03] <jzaefferer> might be inspired be testswarm, but of course yahoo would roll their own /o\
[16:19:13] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: this may keep me up all night, and there is a risk involved that my monday I will have a repository testswarm-next which consists soley of node js files :-/
[16:19:31] <jzaefferer> hehe
[16:19:33] <jzaefferer> oh well
[16:20:01] <Krinkle> we're taking back from yahoo what they took, and make awesomeness :D
[16:20:08] <Krinkle> err. I mean grunt awesomeness, of course
[16:28:45] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I demand presentation feedback!
[16:28:46] <johnbender> joking
[16:28:56] <johnbender> I'd really appreciate it if/when you get time
[16:29:34] <jzaefferer> johnbender: you should get something tomorrow/later - you took your time, too ;)
[16:29:50] <johnbender> jzaefferer: hahaha fair enough
[16:30:01] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I appreciate you taking the time

[19:02:15] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i almost have a insanely long write up about all the new shit
[19:02:26] <gnarf> I really hope someone can distill some of this
[19:02:46] <DaveMethvin> if you have the raw material gnarf i will work on it
[19:02:50] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[19:04:13] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: https://gist.github.com/54829d408993526fe475 - take a peek?
[19:05:12] <gnarf> that whole part about callbacks isn't in master yet

[19:07:04] <DaveMethvin> This looks like the right level of detail for api.jquery.com, and perhaps we can put together a blog post or learn.jquery.com article
