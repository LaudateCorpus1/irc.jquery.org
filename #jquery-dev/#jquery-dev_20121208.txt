[00:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> And in the process, he got all of our old crufty code passing JSHint.
[00:00:23] <snover> by turning off all the options? ;)
[00:00:43] <scott_gonzalez> heh, nope, he actually went in and cleaned up the code just enough to pass.
[00:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> He also went through the disabled test suites and made them pass so he could require tests with all PRs.
[00:01:37] <snover> i just started a repo to get to that point with dojo core with a new strict set of rules
[00:02:28] <snover> 8 years of code
[00:02:29] <snover> ugh
[00:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> I know that feeling.
[00:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> We're not even that old.
[00:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> 1.0 was 5 years ago.
[00:03:56] <snover> the particular code i am looking at right now was written by someone that, for some reason, looooooved to write assignments with a whitespace after the = and no whitespace before the =
[00:04:03] <scott_gonzalez> The amount of green on this report is encouraging though: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/29
[00:04:33] <snover> yeah
[00:04:38] <snover> hey
[00:05:02] <snover> my login is broken
[00:05:02] <snover> ok
[00:05:10] <snover> i would really like that report if you could share it
[00:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/50df26961aca251dc06a
[00:06:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why I made that a private gist 7 months ago...
[00:06:12] <snover> time to break our trac
[00:07:11] <snover> god i hate ibm.
[00:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if you do a big thank you to everyone at the end of a release, but I created this report to find everyone who reported or commented on a ticket marked as fixed for a specific version: https://gist.github.com/3091798
[00:08:24] <snover> boy that report isnâ€™t working here for some reason
[00:08:27] <snover> either that or we have no bugs
[00:08:32] <snover> i suspect we call bug defect or something
[00:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> could be
[00:08:42] <snover> yep
[00:08:45] <snover> itâ€™s more enterprisey that way
[00:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[00:09:04] <snover> http://bugs.dojotoolkit.org/report/168 this is sweet. thanks!
[00:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[00:09:52] <snover> i canâ€™t tell you how chuffed i will be to get to tell most of the ibm people that their commit privileges are revoked due to being dumb
[00:10:24] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[00:11:32] <scott_gonzalez> I should get some sleep. I just know my kids will be awake in about 3 hours.
[00:11:43] <snover> sleep sounds good. 3 hours of sleep sounds awful
[00:11:45] <snover> good luck with that
[00:11:50] <snover> try earplugs and/or tying them to the bed
[00:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully they'll just go downsairs, watch tv and leave us alone.
[00:12:27] <snover> :) good night
[00:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> good night
[00:12:36] <snover> thanks again for your help!
[00:12:57] <scott_gonzalez> any time
[00:37:35] <warden23> Hello, how much to fix this problem.. It's fine in Firefox, Chrome but not IE9. It loads up fine but then when you click products link up top the slider doesn't work: http://www.toggleway.com.au/pre-release/tikraionline/index.php/products
[00:37:51] <warden23> Then debugger comes up with: SCRIPT438: Object doesn't support property or method 'undefined' 
[00:37:51] <warden23> module.js.php?v=1, line 82 character 3
[00:38:19] <warden23> Which is: return jQuery.easing[jQuery.easing.def](x, t, b, c, d);
[01:07:04] <snover> scott_gonzalez: it sure would be great if the pointer events api could also fix the thing where itâ€™s sorta annoying to get the pointer location relative to the target element
[01:07:18] <snover> instead of extending mouseevent and therefore only having screen/clientXY
[01:08:07] <snover> ALSO
[01:08:22] <snover> there are a lot of extra implied default actions with e.g. touch events
[01:08:57] <snover> sometimes maybe you donâ€™t want to stop *all* the default actions, just a subset of them
[01:09:36] <snover> but that all might be outside the purview of this spec.
[01:11:40] <snover> also nothing in the spec on gestures
[01:14:58] <snover> oh also, pointer positions on transformed elements
[06:25:10] <niyazpk> Hello all, is there a ticket/discussion where I can read more about fixing the promise implementation in jQuery ? (ref: "You're Missing the Point of Promises" https://gist.github.com/3889970 )

[15:56:31] <jaubourg> hi there
[15:56:48] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I hate time zones
[16:04:47] <bjartekll555> Looking for help on this problem http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ui-sortable-and-droppable-list
[19:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> snover: re: "itâ€™s sorta annoying to get the pointer location relative to the target element" Do you mean you want offsets from the top left of the target element?
[19:25:19] <snover> scott_gonzalez: yeha.
[19:25:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll bring that up.
[19:25:42] <snover> itâ€™s been a grip that i have had about dom mouseevents since forever
[19:25:44] <snover> gripe*
[19:25:46] <scott_gonzalez> Gestures are outside the scope of Pointer Events v1.
[19:25:48] <snover> cannot type tonightâ€¦
[19:27:05] <snover> thatâ€™s too bad. having to write platform-correct actions even for things as simple as a tap on an element are kind of annoyingly complex.
[19:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> Multiple WG members are interested in them, but we're more interested in getting a spec to recommendation status.
[19:28:07] <scott_gonzalez> MS does have the touch-action stuff.
[19:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> Gestures were out of scope for Touch Events v1 also.
[19:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if it's related to patents at all.
[19:29:11] <scott_gonzalez> But I know getting v1 finalized ASAP is a priority.
[19:32:23] <snover> well luckily the jobs gesture patent sounds like it is being invalidated
