[04:00:07] <phura> Hi guys anyone who can help I am new to jquery need some help anyone?
[04:01:48] <phura> help?
[04:01:56] <phura> anyone there?
[04:17:57] <phura> guys?
[04:18:03] <phura> anyone pls
[04:47:37] <jayflux> the whole layerX and layerY situation which has been deprecated in 1.7. Will i need to make any changes to plugins or my code or is this purely an internal jQuery thing?
[04:51:14] <gnarf> jayflux: layerX and layerY were deprecated by chrome
[04:51:30] <gnarf> jayflux: we just updated 1.7 to stop checking for them to stop giving the warnings
[04:52:00] <jayflux> Yeah gnarf  i get the notices coming up in my console. I was just checking weather it was my scripts causing the notices or jQuery. (IE do i need to change anything at all? or is it just a simple jQuery fix)
[04:52:18] <gnarf> jayflux: its just a warning
[04:52:21] <gnarf> and can be safely ignored
[04:52:35] <jayflux> ok thanks thats the answer i was looking for
[04:52:39] <gnarf> as long as YOU aren't using layerX
[04:52:41] <gnarf> and layerY
[04:52:44] <gnarf> you should be good
[04:52:45] <gnarf> :)
[04:52:59] <jayflux> well i did a search in my scripts for layerX and it didnt return anything so i think its just jQuery
[04:53:05] <gnarf> yup
[04:53:10] <gnarf> its in the event normalization
[04:53:18] <gnarf> it copys over all the properties from the old object
[04:53:23] <gnarf> so it ends up accessing layerX
[04:53:40] <gnarf> which chrome gladly informs you will be going away
[05:28:36] <mikesherov> github's line note discussion threads are dangerous
[05:28:53] <mikesherov> I find myself commenting on old commits way too often
[05:29:39] <mikesherov> One time it even prompted me to call myself a jerk
[05:40:17] <gnarf> heh
[05:41:00] <gnarf> mikesherov: does make size work for you? :)
[05:41:13] <mikesherov> ?
[05:41:45] <gnarf> there is a "make size" on jQuery which will give you a size report with diff from the last time you ran make size
[05:41:55] <mikesherov> yeah
[05:42:06] <gnarf> just saw your comment with the size in it :)
[05:42:19] <mikesherov> oh, to orkel?
[05:42:24] <gnarf> yeah
[05:42:25] <mikesherov> he's going to kill me
[05:42:59] <mikesherov> each comment I make, the stupider I sound
[05:43:11] <phura> ha ha ha h  funny
[05:43:13] <gnarf> there is an edit button...
[05:43:22] * gnarf raises an eyebrow
[05:43:30] <phura> ha ha ha
[05:43:37] <mikesherov> HAHAH
[05:43:38] <phura> need help guys
[05:43:43] * gnarf wonders how long phura would hold up at a dramatic bug reading
[05:43:49] <mikesherov> delete all my comments, and he's talking to himself
[05:43:50] <aaronmcadam> ?channels @ phura
[05:43:50] <bot-t> phura, For support please go to #jquery or #jquerymobile. Development Channels: #jquery-dev - #jqueryui-dev - #jquerymobile-dev ; Meetings held in#jquery-meeting
[05:44:15] <phura> why you like this?
[05:44:19] <mikesherov> you should read the comments between orkel and myself at the next dramatic reading
[05:44:23] <aaronmcadam> this is the DEV channel
[05:44:29] <aaronmcadam> not the support one
[05:44:41] <mikesherov> I envision steam coming out of his ears
[05:44:42] <phura> cool which one is the support?
[05:44:47] <aaronmcadam> #jquery
[05:45:12] <phura> cool thanks guys for you help sulking
[05:45:27] <mikesherov> the funny thing is that some of my coworkers a few months ago nicknamed me morkel
[05:45:32] <mikesherov> and then orkel shows up
[05:45:37] <mikesherov> he's like my arch nemesis
[05:45:45] <phura> mhhhhhhhh
[05:45:47] <phura> bye
[05:47:06] <mikesherov> oh, gnarf.... at the time of orkel's pull request, make size didn't exist
[05:47:19] <mikesherov> I was wondering why it didn't automatically do the size diff
[05:47:21] <gnarf> yeah, boo
[05:47:40] <gnarf> the branch is totally stale now too
[05:48:30] <mikesherov> but the PR actually seems like a win
[05:48:54] <mikesherov> again, to me 141 bytes is nothing
[05:49:02] <mikesherov> although, that's how code bloat happens
[05:49:14] <mikesherov> 141 bytes here, 50 there...
[05:50:18] <gnarf> you can cherry-pick 61277d2864b00c5206d0fdcefc67f7497663a012
[05:50:23] <gnarf> that will give you make sizer
[05:51:03] <mikesherov> cool, thanks
[05:51:57] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/befe48c397fe44185ba5
[05:52:00] <mikesherov> I manually made and gizpped the two versions, before orkel's and after his commits. I just thought somewhere on the thread we should have the actual perf vs. size numbers
[05:52:32] <mikesherov> yeah, so 141 bytes
[06:09:04] <timmywil> rwaldron: ohai
[06:09:27] <rwaldron> timmywil why I ougha
[06:09:32] <rwaldron> EFF
[06:09:35] <rwaldron> oughta
[06:09:38] <timmywil> hehe
[06:09:42] <rwaldron> my fingers are FREEZING
[06:09:56] <timmywil> yea, john tweeted about snow?
[06:09:58] <timmywil> and thunder?
[06:10:02] <timmywil> AT THE SAME TIME
[06:10:05] <rwaldron> last night: snow, thunder, lightning,
[06:10:06] <rwaldron> yeah
[06:10:13] <rwaldron> i woke up to a car COVERED in ice
[06:10:18] <timmywil> eek
[06:10:54] <timmywil> rwaldron: so yea, my comment wasn't actually constructive because currently there is nowhere better than #qunit-fixture, but I'd like to change that
[06:11:05] <rwaldron> talk to me
[06:11:17] <rwaldron> tell me what you're thinking
[06:11:39] <timmywil> our own container inside qunit-fixture that everything goes in, then use that for custom appending
[06:11:40] <rwaldron> I understand that sometimes, esp with position tests, we have no choice but to use the body
[06:11:54] <rwaldron> ok, I'm into that
[06:11:58] <rwaldron> definitely
[06:12:10] <rwaldron> used as like, context arg?
[06:12:22] <rwaldron> sorry
[06:12:31] <rwaldron> i mean, can be used as context arg
[06:12:37] <rwaldron> if needed
[06:12:42] <rwaldron> i like this idea
[06:12:46] <timmywil> cause QUnit depends on the name qunit-fixture. so using our own container separates dependencies
[06:13:02] <rwaldron> er, yeah, but that's the point
[06:13:14] <rwaldron> but still, I'm in support of your idea regardless
[06:13:15] <gnarf> rwaldron: spotify:track:4w0hWaSc3eXnOaDam5ctQa
[06:13:15] <socialhapy> ★ Information Society - What's On Your Mind (Popularity: ▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯▯, N/A in SE) ★ http://bit.ly/vSZldX
[06:13:29] <timmywil> rwaldron: sure, I'm not saying put anything outside of qunit-fixture.
[06:13:37] <timmywil> remember when qunit-fixture was called something else?
[06:13:44] <rwaldron> #main
[06:13:44] <timmywil> and i had to go through and change the name everywhere
[06:13:57] <rwaldron> but i dont think it will change again
[06:14:19] <timmywil> yea, i just remember thinking, maybe we should have been using our own container
[06:14:23] <rwaldron> i think it changed from main->qunit-fixture because jzaefferer got better at writing the suite
[06:14:27] <rwaldron> :)
[06:14:33] <timmywil> WHAT
[06:14:37] <timmywil> better?
[06:14:45] <timmywil> mind blown
[06:14:52] <rwaldron> ohhh sarcasm
[06:14:58] <rwaldron> i've heard of that!
[06:15:03] <rwaldron> it's new right???
[06:15:18] <timmywil> rwaldron: you're instantly a master
[06:15:21] <rwaldron> http://ponyfac.es/
[06:15:32] <timmywil> wow
[06:15:43] <timmywil> that's kind of amazing
[06:16:24] <timmywil> neway, w/e, im not that concerned.
[06:16:36] <rwaldron> lets not forget this idea
[06:16:43] <gnarf> what idea?
[06:16:58] <rwaldron> yer mom!
[06:17:07] <timmywil> good idea
[06:17:11] <gnarf> so's your face
[06:17:19] <rwaldron> \BOOM/
[06:17:46] <timmywil> it's raining here in the 'noog

[06:39:31] <gnarf> kswedberg: i just noticed something missing from animation docs
[06:39:49] <gnarf> all the .animate() aliases that take (duration, easing, callback) can also take the ( options ) map
[06:44:41] <rwaldron> timmywil they happen dude
[06:45:00] <kswedberg> gnar: ah, yearh
[06:45:05] <gnarf> kswedberg: and i tried to write a few words / copy some xml for some of the stuff in http://oksoclap.com/1-7-docs
[06:45:35] <kswedberg> gnarf: awesome. Imma gonna work on docs this weekend.
[06:46:02] <gnarf> kswedberg: cool, at some point maybe you and i could collab on the "runner" object being passed to the queue function
[06:46:24] <kswedberg> sure. hit me up sometime this weeknd.
[06:46:32] <timmywil> rwaldron: what happens?

[06:58:44] <gnarf> yup
[07:52:18] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gnarf rwaldron: are you good with an rc2 today?
[07:52:29] <timmywil> sure
[07:52:41] <rwaldron> lemme run test suites before answering that.
[07:52:51] <DaveMethvin> ideally i would like rc2 to be the exact same bits as the final
[07:53:02] <DaveMethvin> so yeah if anything needs to be changed let's do it now
[07:53:26] <timmywil> lemme land something first
[07:53:45] <rwaldron> dammit
[07:53:53] <gnarf> let timmy land then we can swarm his job with some pure browsers?
[07:53:54] <rwaldron> lemme know when you're ready
[07:54:03] <rwaldron> gnarf, link?
[07:54:09] <rwaldron> i will connect my XP machine here
[07:54:24] <gnarf> rwaldron: swarm.jquery.org/run/yourusernameafteryoumakeone
[07:54:46] <gnarf> rwaldron: make sure browser & tab are in focus :)
[07:55:13] <rwaldron> thank you sir
[07:55:16] <rwaldron> fuck
[07:55:32] <rwaldron> that sort of blows the wad
[07:56:01] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/mQc8Kg
[07:56:01] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Landing pull request 562. Make sure runtimeStyle isn't affected by dimensions. Fixes #9233. - Mike Sherov
[07:56:10] <timmywil> ok
[07:56:14] <DaveMethvin> "[jquery] timmywil pushed 14 new commits to master: complete rewrite of attribute engine" :D
[07:56:22] <timmywil> hehe
[07:56:25] <timmywil> don't tempt me
[07:56:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah we'll need an rc3 for that ....
[07:57:16] <DaveMethvin> damn real work ... i'll do rc2 during lunch
[07:57:43] <timmywil> im hooking up all IEs to swarm
[07:59:01] <gnarf> ?swarm
[07:59:02] <timmywil> ok, i've got ie6-9 running
[07:59:02] <bot-t> Swarm Status: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/qunit/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerycolor/ -- Jenkins http://swarm.jquery.org:8080
[07:59:27] <timmywil> i'll go ahead and stick opera 11.5 in there too
[08:00:08] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/189/
[08:00:46] <gnarf> i'll grab safari
[08:01:07] <timmywil> still need firefoxes and opera 11.1
[08:01:19] <rwaldron> hm, no new tests to run?
[08:01:25] <rwaldron> i'll get the foxes
[08:02:05] <rwaldron> i think i'd like testswarm more if i could use twitter/gmail/facebook/disqus WHATEVER to login
[08:02:52] <timmywil> or inifinte sessions
[08:02:53] <gnarf> ie9 clone test error in manip?
[08:03:03] <gnarf> "Element contents cloned"
[08:03:04] <timmywil> known error
[08:03:25] <timmywil> i guess we could finally look into it
[08:03:55] <gnarf> ie8 seems frozen timmy
[08:04:30] <timmywil> was waiting for opera to finish so i could take away focus
[08:04:43] <gnarf> :)
[08:04:52] <gnarf> im tabbing back and forth during "cooldowns"
[08:04:57] <timmywil> heh me too
[08:05:08] <timmywil> running ui tests now
[08:05:30] <rwaldron> WOOO
[08:05:51] <rwaldron> running opera 11.5x
[08:06:15] <timmywil> rwaldron: 11.1
[08:06:29] <timmywil> ie8 going again
[08:06:47] <rwaldron> i just updated opera and swarm identified as 11.5x
[08:06:54] <rwaldron> or do you mean yours was 11.1?
[08:07:05] <timmywil> mine was 11.5, they already ran
[08:07:15] <timmywil> so we need an 11.1
[08:07:40] <timmywil> ok, i've got ff3.6 now
[08:07:48] <rwaldron> weird
[08:07:57] <rwaldron> mine ran as 11.5x
[08:08:02] <rwaldron> hmmm
[08:08:39] <timmywil> yea, there's that ajax error with statusText in OPera
[08:09:00] <timmywil> jaubourg knows about it, but I don't think he's had a chance to look at it
[08:09:23] <rwaldron> eek
[08:09:28] <rwaldron> lots of tests in FF7?
[08:09:30] <rwaldron> effects
[08:09:31] <gnarf> i think new FF was not in the foreground
[08:09:42] <gnarf> running another FF to try to green em
[08:09:47] <rwaldron> ord
[08:09:48] <rwaldron> word*
[08:10:45] <timmywil> sweet
[08:11:42] <gnarf> im gonna start up another ie6
[08:11:44] <rwaldron> sadface
[08:11:45] <gnarf> try to get rid of that black
[08:11:57] <rwaldron> i think browserstack's IE8 is borked
[08:12:02] <rwaldron> it crashes on the test suite
[08:12:12] <timmywil> mine does too
[08:12:22] <timmywil> i think it's a testswarm issue
[08:12:22] <rwaldron> VM?
[08:12:35] <timmywil> yea
[08:12:37] <rwaldron> i was experiencing this with just the test suite
[08:12:40] <rwaldron> last week
[08:12:42] <rwaldron> :(
[08:12:46] <timmywil> orly?
[08:12:50] <rwaldron> yep
[08:12:53] <timmywil> hmm
[08:12:59] <rwaldron> yeah
[08:13:03] <rwaldron> hm indeed
[08:13:13] <rwaldron> lemme try the one native install i have for IE8
[08:14:39] <timmywil> hooking up op 11.1
[08:15:21] <rwaldron> this XP machine is fucked
[08:15:24] <rwaldron> its like...
[08:15:31] <rwaldron> i havent used it in months
[08:15:39] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: "event: fixHooks extensions" fails in FF3.6 maybe?
[08:15:48] <gnarf> someone have another FF3.6 to run against that and verify?
[08:15:53] <rwaldron> and it's acting like its confused about how to be a computer
[08:16:07] <timmywil> gnarf, DaveMethvin: yes, just checked in local test suite
[08:16:19] <rwaldron> gnarf one sec
[08:16:29] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/189/
[08:16:40] <gnarf> hole in the IE8
[08:18:09] <rwaldron> running in a real native IE8
[08:18:32] <timmywil> rwaldron: i just did and it all passed
[08:18:45] <timmywil> after recovering the tab of course :P
[08:18:50] <rwaldron> eff
[08:18:56] <rwaldron> holy shit
[08:19:04] <rwaldron> the XP machine just crashed
[08:19:08] <rwaldron> the whole thing
[08:19:10] <rwaldron> DEAD
[08:19:14] <rwaldron> rebooted
[08:19:18] <gnarf> heh
[08:19:26] <timmywil> in bstack?
[08:19:29] <rwaldron> no
[08:19:33] <rwaldron> on XP machine
[08:19:35] <gnarf> timmywil: IE8 refresh? see if it will give you traversing
[08:20:31] <timmywil> it's giving me mobile tests
[08:20:38] <rwaldron> i was seeing that as well
[08:20:47] <rwaldron> and UI tests
[08:23:05] <timmywil> the ff3.6 test didn't trigger a native click
[08:23:41] <rwaldron> has anyone seen this? http://testling.com/
[08:32:52] <timmywil> rwaldron: that looks cool
[08:43:27] <timmywil> why don't we apply fixHooks to jQuery events
[08:44:13] <timmywil> DaveMethvin?
[08:50:32] <timmywil> dave has disappeared
[08:50:42] <timmywil> lunchtime
[08:51:44] <timmywil> ?tell DaveMethvin concerning event: fixHooks extensions fail in ff3.6, I switched to jQuery triggering the click and I'm just curious why fixHooks don't get applied to jQuery events
[08:51:44] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[09:22:52] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: fixHooks only fix native event properties
[09:22:53] <bot-t> (31 mins 9 secs ago) <timmywil> tell DaveMethvin concerning event: fixHooks extensions fail in ff3.6, I switched to jQuery triggering the click and I'm just curious why fixHooks don't get applied to jQuery events
[09:23:19] <DaveMethvin> there's a second props arg to jQuery.Event if you want to pass fake values
[09:24:02] <DaveMethvin> as for why they fail in 3.6... i dunno
[09:24:25] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: is there a testswarm run that fails for 3.6?
[09:29:51] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/189/
[09:30:07] <gnarf> one lonely IE8 yellow spot
[09:30:15] <gnarf> that 3.6 events bug
[09:30:24] <gnarf> and the opera ajax statusText
[09:31:44] <gnarf> gl with RC2
[09:32:18] <gnarf> bbl
[09:56:25] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin according to... http://swarm.jquery.org/job/189/
[09:56:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah gnarf linked it
[09:56:42] <rwaldron> yeah
[09:56:44] <rwaldron> that was weird
[09:56:52] <rwaldron> his message was not on the screen
[09:56:54] <DaveMethvin> do you recall that test case? we changed it
[09:56:57] <rwaldron> as soon as I typed and hit enter
[09:57:00] <rwaldron> it appeared
[09:57:03] <rwaldron> then mine after
[09:57:04] <DaveMethvin> originally i had it as blur
[09:57:24] <DaveMethvin> then you and i worked on it for some reason (can't remember why) and changed to click
[09:57:39] <DaveMethvin> maybe b/c of all the focus/blur issues with testing
[09:57:53] <DaveMethvin> i just don't recall
[09:58:22] <DaveMethvin> but anyway, i think this is an artifact of testing and not a problem with 3.6
[09:58:39] <DaveMethvin> just like the focus/blur ones
[09:59:04] <timmywil> it seems the native click just doesn't fire
[09:59:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah, but i don't know why
[09:59:54] <DaveMethvin> and .trigger()ed events have never gone through fix since they aren't native browserr events
[09:59:57] <timmywil> maybe we should switch it to dispatch/fire?
[10:00:15] <timmywil> yea i saw your comment
[10:00:25] <timmywil> i didn't realize that
[10:00:25] <DaveMethvin> i have been meaning to look at doing that, it might help make the tests more realistic
[10:00:54] <DaveMethvin> the issue is that the triggered native events are hard to set up
[10:01:13] <DaveMethvin> i do it in one of the tests already though
[10:01:16] <DaveMethvin> lemme find it
[10:01:17] <timmywil> https://gist.github.com/1322771
[10:02:02] <timmywil> that's minimaljs's event trigger
[10:02:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah but there are diferent kind of events, dunno if we have to do them like MouseEvent, KeyEvent etc
[10:02:59] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/event.js#L362
[10:03:38] <DaveMethvin> so we could generalize that and use it instead of trigger()ing so much, IF it works in swarm and such
[10:04:07] <DaveMethvin> there was a reason i didn't fireEvent , but i don't recall it
[10:04:39] <DaveMethvin> o i have a meeting
[10:05:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i'll do some 3.6 testing
[10:11:55] <timmywil> hmm, neither works in ff3.6 http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/EgDbb/
[10:22:09] <timmywil> strange
[10:23:36] <timmywil> maybe an addEventListener bug
[10:23:37] <timmywil> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/EgDbb/10/
[10:23:59] <timmywil> fire does work if the handler is bound with .onclick
[10:31:19] <timmywil> ?tell DaveMethvin this works in all browsers https://gist.github.com/b0a55cfdefad7138ee79
[10:31:20] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[10:34:36] <timmywil> i'm not sure how that works cause I thought we bound our handlers with addEventListener in 3.6, but it fires
[10:34:59] <timmywil> hander*
[10:35:04] <timmywil> handler*
[10:39:16] <DaveMethvin> .
[10:39:16] <bot-t> (7 mins 57 secs ago) <timmywil> tell DaveMethvin this works in all browsers https://gist.github.com/b0a55cfdefad7138ee79
[10:39:21] <DaveMethvin> yay timmywil!
[10:39:40] <DaveMethvin> we do bind with addEventListener
[10:39:41] <timmywil> :)  maybe we want to add that to testinit?
[10:39:48] <timmywil> that's what i thought
[10:39:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah rather than copypasta into each test :P
[10:39:55] <timmywil> then i don't understand
[10:40:10] <DaveMethvin> what part?
[10:40:18] <timmywil> cause the fiddle shows that the handlers only fire when bound with the property handler
[10:40:35] <timmywil> maybe we do other fixes?
[10:41:03] <timmywil> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/EgDbb/
[10:41:12] <timmywil> in 3.6, nothing logs
[10:41:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was looking at the gist
[10:41:17] <DaveMethvin> lol
[10:41:40] <timmywil> but if i do, http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/EgDbb/10/
[10:41:47] <timmywil> the fire click and both blurs log
[10:42:18] <timmywil> so wtf
[10:42:20] <timmywil> :P
[10:43:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah i agree
[10:43:21] <DaveMethvin> there needs to be a differ for fiddles
[10:43:32] <DaveMethvin> took me a bit to find the diffs
[10:43:41] <timmywil> oh sry
[10:43:48] <DaveMethvin> so .onsomething prop fires but not aEL
[10:43:55] <timmywil> exactly
[10:43:56] <DaveMethvin> which is what you said
[10:44:13] <ben_alman> hey DaveMethvin when using .attachEvent do event handlers fire in reverse-order?
[10:44:24] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: shouldn't
[10:44:27] <ben_alman> just trying something in IE, nothing to do with jQuery
[10:44:28] <ben_alman> hmmn
[10:44:45] <DaveMethvin> oh like bare attachEvent? I dunno
[10:44:52] <ben_alman> yeah bare
[10:44:53] <ben_alman> hmmn
[10:44:54] <DaveMethvin> we only attach one and manage the list ourselves
[10:44:57] <ben_alman> right
[10:46:05] <timmywil> ben_alman: i haven't tested that behavior either
[10:46:10] <ben_alman> i'm looking @ it
[10:46:26] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yeah the only conclusion to draw from that is that aEL is broken somehow ... but only on that test??
[10:46:44] <ben_alman> http://cute-solutions.blogspot.com/2006/02/order-of-events.html
[10:46:53] <ben_alman> looks like IE is simply random-ish
[10:47:17] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: well it's broken everywhere, but why not on that test? :P
[10:47:25] <timmywil> know what i mean?
[10:47:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah someone is wrong and they must PAY!
[10:48:11] <DaveMethvin> when you use .onstuff with .trigger() we call it explcitly there so that's why that triggers
[10:48:26] <DaveMethvin> it's all in javascript with no browser ambiguity
[10:48:48] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: although in ie's defense the order of events wasn't defined until w3c events level 3
[10:48:57] <ben_alman> fair enough
[10:48:59] <ben_alman> I GUESS
[10:49:00] <DaveMethvin> it's just that normal ppl would have expected a q
[10:49:06] <timmywil> order of callbacks was
[10:49:35] <ben_alman> i dunno, multiple bound elem.attachEvent("onclick", fn); execute out of order
[10:49:39] <ben_alman> that's all i no
[10:50:04] <timmywil> WAIT
[10:50:08] <timmywil> holy shit
[10:50:16] <timmywil> "When sEvent fires on the object, the object's sEvent handler is called before fpNotify, the specified function. If you attach multiple functions to the same event on the same object, the functions are called in random order, immediately after the object's event handler is called."
[10:50:22] <timmywil> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536343(v=vs.85).aspx
[10:50:29] <ben_alman> lol
[10:50:36] <DaveMethvin> so THERE!
[10:50:47] <ben_alman> hahaha
[10:51:02] <timmywil> that is retarded
[10:52:06] <DaveMethvin> that is IE
[10:52:16] <ben_alman> when given the choice to implement something as an ordered list or random, microsoft chose random. brilliant
[10:52:30] <ben_alman> "NO REALLY IT CAN BE ORDERED THATS OK"
[10:52:49] <ben_alman> "NAH WE'LL LEAVE IT RANDOM. NOBODY WILL EVERY POSSIBLY WANT THESE IN ORDER"
[10:53:00] <DaveMethvin> Although all EventListeners on the EventTarget are guaranteed to be triggered by any event which is received by that EventTarget, no specification is made as to the order in which they will receive the event with regards to the other EventListeners on the EventTarget.
[10:53:09] <DaveMethvin> http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/
[10:53:16] <ben_alman> but still
[10:53:25] <timmywil> so they choose RANDOM?
[10:53:26] <ben_alman> ok, no specification? let's do them in the order in which they were bound.
[10:53:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah random is too strong a word, i think the l2 spec is right as far as wording
[10:54:15] <timmywil> they as in ms
[10:54:26] <ben_alman> but like, surely they maintain a list of bound handlers
[10:54:28] <ben_alman> somewhere
[10:54:31] <ben_alman> THERE IS A LIST
[10:54:31] <timmywil> they chose to implement random order because the spec didn't specify which order
[10:54:40] <ben_alman> do they specifically randomize that list?
[10:54:42] <ben_alman> heh
[10:54:55] <danzik17> seriously?  you'd think it'd take more effort for just processing them in order
[10:55:11] <DaveMethvin> maybe the ms implemeenter wanted to practice the card shuffle algorithm they learned in programming class
[10:55:18] <timmywil> haha
[10:55:26] <timmywil> THIS'LL BE FUN
[10:55:35] <sneakyness> gotta get down on friday
[10:56:42] <ben_alman> the DOM is good times
[10:56:54] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: anyway, shall I add fireNative to testinit?
[10:57:05] <DaveMethvin> sure timmywil that woudl be great
[10:57:11] <timmywil> kk
[10:59:23] <ben_alman> lol @ MDN "addEventListener() and removeEventListener() are a recent addition to the standard; as such they may not be present in all browsers. You can work around this by inserting the following code at the beginning of your scripts" followed by 50 lines of insane event handler code
[11:03:38] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ah, i see what i did differently
[11:03:48] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i forgot the third argument to ael
[11:03:53] <DaveMethvin> ah, ok
[11:03:58] <timmywil> i feel better
[11:04:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah and that dies on some browsers
[11:05:04] <ben_alman> yeah i just learned that as well
[11:05:05] <timmywil> it's not optional in some
[11:05:34] <timmywil> i have it in minimaljs, not sure how i missed it
[11:05:55] <DaveMethvin> cause you hardly ever use it, natch
[11:06:02] <timmywil> true facts
[11:06:25] <timmywil> soon, all i will is .on whatever i'm working on
[11:06:28] <timmywil> do*
[11:06:49] <paul_irish> ben_alman: should we remove that?
[11:06:57] <ben_alman> paul_irish, what
[11:07:03] <paul_irish> that MDN aEL bit
[11:07:16] <ben_alman> paul_irish, i dunno, it seems really mental
[11:07:29] <timmywil> eh, it's not bad to see what it takes exactly
[11:07:33] <paul_irish> ?mdc addeventlistener
[11:07:34] <bot-t> paul_irish, element.addEventListener - MDN - addEventListener registers a single event listener on a single target. The event target may be a single node in a document, the document itself, a window , or an XMLHttpRequest . https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener
[11:07:49] <ben_alman> i've been going through mdn a LOT lately and there's so many inconsistencies
[11:08:02] <ben_alman> but i have no time to deal with it, i just have to press on
[11:08:29] <timmywil> oh
[11:08:38] <paul_irish> with such a large corpus, there is bound to be lotssss of inconsistencies
[11:08:40] <timmywil> well, it doesn't use attachEvent as a fallback
[11:08:52] <timmywil> i probably wouldn't recommend that
[11:08:58] <paul_irish> you're right...
[11:09:04] <ben_alman> yeah
[11:09:11] <paul_irish> ah inline handlers.
[11:09:43] <timmywil> i see why it's done that way tho
[11:10:11] <timmywil> as we've just learned, attachEvent fires callbacks in random order (wtf?)
[11:10:39] <paul_irish> sweet.
[11:10:43] <timmywil> and if you've gotta do all that, why not write universal code for pre addEventListener browsers that don't have attachEvent
[11:10:53] <timmywil> but meh
[11:10:58] <timmywil> i don't care about those
[11:16:02] <ben_alman> element.onclick = fn;
[11:16:04] <ben_alman> WIN
[11:17:33] <DaveMethvin> THERE CAN BE ONLY ONE
[11:17:54] <timmywil> said jet li
[11:18:00] <ben_alman> "i want two" <closed worksforme>
[11:18:43] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/-3ouaQ
[11:18:43] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Add a way to fire native events using dispatchEvent/fireEvent in testinit.js; fixes failing click test in FF3.6 - timmywil
[11:19:36] <timmywil> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/190/
[11:20:17] <DaveMethvin> c'mon big green!
[11:20:46] <paul_irish> ben_alman: weird aEL polyfill was removed. talked to the MDN folks about it and they agreed to wipe it
[11:20:53] <timmywil> we've still got that one ajax fail in opera and that manipulation fail in ie9
[11:21:09] <timmywil> paul_irish: nice
[11:21:49] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: did you say you already looked at that fail in ie9?
[11:21:59] <ben_alman> cool paul
[11:22:05] <timmywil> i'm not worried about either one, but i suppose we could look at it
[11:22:20] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #147: STILL FAILING in 3 min 27 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/147/
[11:22:20] <jq-jenkins> timmywillisn: Add a way to fire native events using dispatchEvent/fireEvent in testinit.js; fixes failing click test in FF3.6
[11:22:31] <timmywil> aw, someone's chrome didn't have focus
[12:08:22] <DaveMethvin> ok, back
[12:08:30] <DaveMethvin> so are we ready for rc2?
[12:11:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yup
[12:11:37] <DaveMethvin> just reviewing the swarm results
[12:11:57] <DaveMethvin> ie8 is hung up in support?
[12:12:15] <timmywil> ie8 hangs on every page load
[12:12:21] <DaveMethvin> is that new?
[12:12:55] <timmywil> sort of, once the tests get going they all pass, but something is causing it to crash in the test suite on initial pageload
[12:13:01] <timmywil> im looking
[12:13:13] <DaveMethvin> the others look like the focus/blur issue except for the opera thing which seems trivial
[12:13:25] <timmywil> and the ie9 object clone
[12:13:35] <timmywil> that's about it
[12:14:01] <timmywil> i just cleared the callbacks opera fails
[12:14:26] <timmywil> lemme check why ie8 is crashing
[12:17:27] <DaveMethvin> on the ie9 object clone it seems like the problem is the clone is lowercase, lemme see if i can fix that
[12:17:49] <DaveMethvin> that must be new i don't think i've seen it on ie9
[12:19:53] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it's been there for a few releases actually
[12:19:59] <timmywil> i know you've seen it
[12:20:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah now i remember it, seeing it here
[12:20:55] <DaveMethvin> so i think we need a new test :P
[12:33:11] <timmywil> hmm, the callbacks tests are causing the crash
[12:33:21] <DaveMethvin> that's not good
[12:33:51] <DaveMethvin> but only for the isolated test?
[12:35:00] <timmywil> hmm?
[12:36:44] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah and my ie8 vm is borked ... i have been testing ie6/7 but not 8 locally damn
[12:39:55] <timmywil_> Ok it's not callbacks
[12:40:19] <timmywil_> The crash is inconsistent
[12:40:23] <DaveMethvin> tryna get my vm working
[12:40:46] <timmywil_> Hard to test
[12:41:15] <DaveMethvin> is there a public addr for running the test suite that I cna use?
[12:41:30] <DaveMethvin> this vm won't access my local net but will get to the internets, go figure
[12:41:45] <timmywil_> The swarm suite will crash it
[12:42:04] <DaveMethvin> but then i have to wait for a swarm run
[12:42:05] <DaveMethvin> right?
[12:42:33] <DaveMethvin> a basic test using jsfiddle works fine with -git
[12:42:35] <timmywil_> Nah, go to one of the jobs and click a module name
[12:42:58] <timmywil_> Ben
[12:43:03] <timmywil_> Brb
[12:43:20] <timmywil_> That was an iPhone autocorrect :P
[12:43:44] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[12:43:51] <DaveMethvin> yep crashes here
[12:46:36] <timmywil> ok
[12:46:42] <DaveMethvin> trying to narrow it down ... seems like once it crashes it works ok
[12:46:46] <DaveMethvin> on subsequent runs
[12:46:51] <timmywil> yea, it's strange
[12:47:00] <timmywil> maybe instead of commenting scripts, i'll go back commits
[12:48:41] <DaveMethvin> job 180 worked for me
[12:49:03] <DaveMethvin> i am closing out the browser and then going to the new test just in case
[12:50:51] <DaveMethvin> BIZARRE
[12:50:59] <DaveMethvin> ok, 189 works okay, but 190 fails
[12:51:16] <DaveMethvin> so in a normal world that would mean the commit for 190 broked it
[12:52:15] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, that's the native event stuff, maybe you're taunting IE too much :P
[12:55:34] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i'm going into a meeting in about 5 minutes, it looks like the prob may be that last native event commit. how about i back that out and we see if ie8 is appeased?
[12:55:54] <timmywil> i've gone back a lot farther and am still able to reproduce
[12:56:03] <DaveMethvin> oh i am sadder
[12:56:26] <timmywil> and im emptying cache and restarting so this may have been here a long time
[12:56:38] <DaveMethvin> man it must be an uninitialized pointer in ie8, the worst possible kind of bug
[12:57:04] <DaveMethvin> so we're doing something to tickle it
[12:57:24] <timmywil> or qunit is
[12:59:00] <timmywil> ok, i've gone back way too far
[12:59:25] <timmywil> went back to before we committed the new qunit and it still did it
[12:59:44] <DaveMethvin> well it's scary that we both got it
[12:59:54] <DaveMethvin> and i just applied patches from ms so it's not an old bug
[13:00:00] <DaveMethvin> i can't repro it now
[13:00:19] <DaveMethvin> tried cleaning out cache etc
[13:00:31] <DaveMethvin> but i got it 2 or 3 times on 190
[13:00:52] <timmywil> idk, if im running the full suite and i wait until after core gets through and try to refresh, i can make it crash
[13:00:57] <timmywil> maybe that's different tho
[13:04:12] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i can repro if i refresh like that too
[13:05:19] <DaveMethvin> c0000005 is what it's giving which is an access violation (bad pointer) ... not sure we can do a lot if it isn't consistent
[13:06:21] <DaveMethvin> yep if i refresh on job 180 i get the same crash
[13:06:31] <ben_alman> q:
[13:06:40] <DaveMethvin> :wq!
[13:06:51] <ben_alman> in jQuery is bubbling done by calling node.parentNode repetetively?
[13:06:59] <ben_alman> by calling i mean fetching
[13:07:07] <DaveMethvin> yep for .trigger()
[13:07:11] <ben_alman> ok
[13:07:12] <DaveMethvin> and for delegated events
[13:07:19] <timmywil> ugh, well this may be difficult to solve
[13:07:23] <ben_alman> so you're not using .dispatchEvent
[13:07:41] <DaveMethvin> no, not inside jquery
[13:07:44] <ben_alman> k
[13:07:50] <DaveMethvin> the browser is going to call our one handler
[13:08:15] <DaveMethvin> if there are no jq events attached then we don't have a handler on the element and the browser skips us
[13:08:15] <ben_alman> i just noiticed that at least in chrome, .dispatchEvent doesn't bubble unless the elements are actually in the DOM
[13:08:24] <ben_alman> makes sense
[13:08:31] <DaveMethvin> well our implementation is better than THEIRS!
[13:08:36] <ben_alman> yeah wacky
[13:08:43] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil what do you think?
[13:08:45] <ben_alman> i hadn't really dug into all this DOM stuff before
[13:08:58] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i think we've actually discovered two crashes
[13:09:11] <timmywil> one's been there forever on a refresh
[13:09:36] <timmywil> the other is reproducible only on the last 3 commits
[13:09:46] <DaveMethvin> orly?
[13:10:01] * DaveMethvin goes to look at last 3 commits
[13:10:34] <timmywil> if i go to #5c0c8… and click ajax, i get an immediate crash
[13:10:40] <timmywil> but not #df4a1
[13:14:07] <DaveMethvin> ok let's try to rule them out  timmywil ... the native event one would be suspect but it doesn't even run if  it's just ajax
[13:14:24] <timmywil> but it loads
[13:14:37] <DaveMethvin> it's only a functionunction!
[13:14:58] <DaveMethvin> but yeah i guess anything is possible
[13:15:16] <DaveMethvin> the runtimestyle one is ie-specific but seems incredibly innocuous
[13:15:25] <DaveMethvin> those are the kind that hurt the most :)
[13:15:39] <timmywil> it surely has something to do with loading, because it happens before anything executes
[13:15:52] <timmywil> at least this crash on load
[13:15:57] <timmywil> i dunno about the refresh
[13:16:21] <DaveMethvin> so that would point to basic program changes or code order changes i guess
[13:16:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah true the screen is empty
[13:22:01] <timmywil> grr
[13:22:30] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: if you can repro the non-refresh one can you send me the crash details?
[13:28:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i have this text file it produced, but it doesn't look right
[13:28:49] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to see if the addresses and errors matched the ones in the refresh
[13:28:56] <DaveMethvin> to see if we're dealing with the same error
[13:29:34] <DaveMethvin> and i've been running this for about 15 minutes and can't make it happen so i'm rebooting to see if that does it
[13:30:59] <timmywil> it produced this xml file http://oksoclap.com/4NJHphNxws
[13:31:10] <timmywil> i can't seem to get any other data
[13:31:40] <DaveMethvin> usually when it pops that window there's a little "details" button with some other text
[13:31:43] <DaveMethvin> bt this helps too
[13:32:33] <timmywil> this is what i see http://cl.ly/1a15392o3B1m0y2r350Z
[13:33:15] <timmywil> then this http://cl.ly/3V2J3Z3k1F3g0d2D1t21
[13:33:26] <timmywil> and i can't select that text :P
[13:34:32] <timmywil> and that txt it generates is the xml
[13:36:33] <DaveMethvin> ok it does look like they may be two sep crashes then
[13:36:52] <DaveMethvin> hard to tell b/c my ie8 is on vista so the addrs may not be the same, i had kinda  hoped the offsets would be
[13:38:57] <DaveMethvin> since i can't repro this crash anymore it's kind of hard for me to tell whether whatever we do is going to fix it
[13:39:18] <DaveMethvin> but i DID see it happen several times early on with 190
[13:39:25] <DaveMethvin> i just can't make it happen anymore
[13:39:54] <timmywil> i keep emptying cache
[13:39:59] <timmywil> but it's still inconsistent
[13:41:11] <timmywil> O.o
[13:41:17] <timmywil> i may have a way to reproduce
[13:41:28] * DaveMethvin listens
[13:41:28] <timmywil> can you still not use your local server?
[13:41:53] <DaveMethvin> still not there
[13:42:23] <timmywil> well if i close ie8 and open the suite from a new window...
[13:42:30] <timmywil> it crashes every time for me
[13:43:33] <timmywil> oo, this is promising
[13:43:50] <DaveMethvin> oh, it took about 30 seconds but while i was typing it finally connected!
[13:44:02] <DaveMethvin> the suite is running, didn't crash yet tho
[13:44:32] <DaveMethvin> where does it usually crash, right at the start?
[13:44:38] <timmywil> ahah
[13:44:41] <timmywil> support
[13:44:53] <timmywil> i knew it
[13:45:02] <DaveMethvin> which test?
[13:45:11] <timmywil> no tests at all
[13:45:25] <timmywil> just loading core, callbacks, deferred, and support
[13:45:35] <timmywil> but not when just core, callbacks, and deferred
[13:45:46] <DaveMethvin> just *loading* it?
[13:45:49] <timmywil> yup
[13:46:04] <DaveMethvin> man, ie8 must really hate jaubourg
[13:46:20] <DaveMethvin> i bet it's his code :)
[13:46:33] <timmywil> lol
[13:46:39] <timmywil> im with you
[13:46:50] <DaveMethvin> but we haven't changed anything there recently  have we?? at least not the last few commits
[13:46:50] <timmywil> not like i have any idea what it is in there yet
[13:47:12] <timmywil> we haven't
[13:47:57] <timmywil> well, i took out a $
[13:48:02] <timmywil> ohnoes!
[13:48:03] <n8o-mba_> any guesses why my qunit tests are repeating endlessly?
[13:48:06] <timmywil> :P
[13:48:09] <DaveMethvin> it isn't crashing for me, lemme empty cache
[13:48:17] <timmywil> and restart browser
[13:49:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah did that
[13:49:53] <DaveMethvin> for some reason it waits like 30 seconds to connect! man i gotta do a new vm
[13:50:01] <DaveMethvin> but it didn't crash
[13:50:08] <timmywil> hmm, it's really consistent for me right now
[13:50:22] <timmywil> i can make it go away by commenting support
[13:50:34] <DaveMethvin> there was a $ in the code?
[13:50:49] <timmywil> regex anchor
[13:50:52] <timmywil> for opacity
[13:50:52] <DaveMethvin> oh
[13:51:00] <DaveMethvin> i thought we took that out
[13:51:09] <timmywil> that's what i said
[13:51:12] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:52:07] <timmywil> and i've made it stop by commenting the offset support tests
[13:52:52] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[13:54:39] <timmywil> this line: body.insertBefore( container, body.firstChild );
[13:55:07] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/f60213648cefa9b53289ad01a55ead22a15e6ee1 maybe?
[13:55:08] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by timmywil (1m, 1w ago): Landing pull request 477. 1.7 jQuery.offset.supportsFixedPosition. Fixes #6809.More Details: - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/477 - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6809
[13:55:36] <timmywil> we moved the offset support tests from offset.js to support.js
[13:56:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah ... although that line was there before
[13:56:23] <DaveMethvin> just got run later no doubt
[13:56:36] <timmywil> it was run lazily actually
[13:56:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:57:20] <DaveMethvin> how far back could you repro this?
[13:57:50] <timmywil> hmm, you know
[13:57:53] <timmywil> there is no firstChild
[13:57:59] <timmywil> there are no children
[13:58:14] <timmywil> afaict
[13:58:30] <timmywil> line 235: testElement.innerHTML = ""
[13:58:42] <timmywil> body is testElement in the offset tests
[13:58:51] <timmywil> so it may be passing null to insertBefore
[13:59:03] <DaveMethvin> oooooh
[14:00:30] <timmywil> bah, it doesn't like appendChild either
[14:03:21] <DaveMethvin> ok i am stepping thru the debugger in chrome and td is a tr element ?
[14:03:48] <DaveMethvin> looks to me like something got confused  here
[14:04:05] <DaveMethvin> O WAITAMINIT
[14:04:14] <timmywil> breakthrough?
[14:04:20] <DaveMethvin> did this code take into acount the tbody that isn't in the markup>
[14:04:30] <timmywil> probably not
[14:04:52] <timmywil> er, i mean
[14:04:56] <timmywil> other way around
[14:05:03] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, did the old code take it into account? i wonder
[14:05:05] <timmywil> yes, but it's not there?
[14:05:16] <DaveMethvin> i think ie forces one in
[14:05:39] <timmywil> great catch tho, lemme try inserting a tbody
[14:06:05] <DaveMethvin> imma look at the old code
[14:09:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think we might have just gotten "lucky" since the offset code isn't called for a lot of pages if it's done lazy
[14:09:20] <timmywil> yea
[14:09:32] <timmywil> it really doesn't like getting attached to the container
[14:13:22] <DaveMethvin> i can't get ie to break on the code, damit
[14:14:43] <timmywil> i'm not sure the td being a tr is a problem
[14:15:03] <timmywil> it's just checkng for offset based on the table border
[14:15:07] <timmywil> which would affect both
[14:17:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah just seems like a very deceptive variable name
[14:17:33] <timmywil> sure
[14:18:02] <DaveMethvin> i am seeing what seems like the same behavior though in ie, the td variable is a tr
[14:18:17] <DaveMethvin> you said you were seeing a nulll?
[14:18:37] <timmywil> for body.firstChild
[14:18:54] <timmywil> but i switched it to body.appendChild and it has the same issue
[14:19:08] <timmywil> so that wasn't it
[14:24:05] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i wonder if the whole invisible-body thing is just too complicated for ie8 to deal with?
[14:24:12] <DaveMethvin> i know that's kind of vague
[14:24:44] <DaveMethvin> but if i was a 4 year old browser with lots of bugs it would probably hurt my widdle head to see that
[14:24:50] <timmywil> it works everywhere except for the offset tests
[14:24:57] <timmywil> well
[14:24:57] <timmywil> and
[14:25:04] <timmywil> this isn't an invisible body anymore
[14:25:26] <DaveMethvin> we haven't gotten to the body so we're using the div?
[14:25:51] <timmywil> oh wait, sry
[14:25:53] <timmywil> yes it is
[14:25:57] <timmywil> we're in the head
[14:26:00] <DaveMethvin> these files are included in the head so we made a body i think
[14:26:05] <timmywil> yea
[14:26:09] <DaveMethvin> and then we have to get rid of the body
[14:26:18] <DaveMethvin> i just wanted to type that
[14:26:24] <timmywil> hehe
[14:26:49] <timmywil> well, lemme move it to the body and see if it fails
[14:26:55] <DaveMethvin> i ws just typing that
[14:27:42] <DaveMethvin> gotta walk the dog brb in 5
[14:28:04] <timmywil> it doesn't fail
[14:28:10] <timmywil> well then
[14:29:14] <timmywil> yep, and i move it back and it fails
[14:29:44] <timmywil> well crapshakes
[14:30:53] <timmywil> O.o
[14:31:15] <timmywil> this may have to do with my ie8 crash test for the invisible body. HA
[14:32:26] <DaveMethvin> i TOLD you we should get rid of the body! lol
[14:32:28] <timmywil> lol yessssssss
[14:32:51] <timmywil>  /*body, div { background: url(http://static.jquery.com/files/rocker/images/logo_jquery_215x53.gif) no-repeat -1000px 0; }*/
[14:33:03] <timmywil>  /* #9239 Attach a background to the body( avoid crashes in removing the test element in support ) */
[14:33:20] <timmywil> that was for ie8
[14:33:27] <DaveMethvin> #9239 NO IT DID NOT
[14:34:03] <DaveMethvin> oh well i wonder how much this will upset ie8's apple cart
[14:34:42] <DaveMethvin> i don't recall all the issues involved here with offsets and when they should be calced
[14:35:14] <timmywil> they need to be attached, but maybe not to the invisible body
[14:35:47] <DaveMethvin> sorry, phone
[14:36:48] <timmywil> ah, yes it needs a body
[14:36:57] <timmywil> at least the fixed position one does
[14:43:48] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i have to run now .. maybe we can pick this up tomorrow? i think an rc2 is even more important now since we have to hide the body
[14:44:23] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: real quick. do you know why we can't use a div attached to the documentElement?
[14:46:28] <timmywil> nvm
[16:31:09] <mikesherov> hey, is there anywhere on the github or docs or forums where we tell people they should develop in feature branches?
[16:35:13] <mikesherov> nvm, it's in http://docs.jquery.com/Getting_Involved
[17:35:46] <rwaldron> ?jqbugz
[17:35:46] <bot-t> https://gist.github.com/672714
[17:48:21] <atrigent> hey guys... I have a question about how appendTo and those other "inverse" functions are implemented
[17:49:19] <atrigent> since I'm used to jquery functions returning the original set of matched elements, I was a bit surprised to learn that appendTo and friends actually return all of the elements which were added to the page
[17:49:46] <atrigent> which can be a lot since the initial element is cloned if it needs to be put in multiple places
[17:49:51] <atrigent> was this the intended behavior?
[17:50:03] <atrigent> because if it was, I think it should probably be documented...
[17:52:28] <gnarf> ?appendto
[17:52:28] <bot-t> .appendTo(target): Insert every element in the set of matched elements to the end of the target. http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[17:53:12] <gnarf> "If there is more than one target element, however, cloned copies of the inserted element will be created for each target after the first."
[17:53:48] <atrigent> gnarf: yes, but it doesn't say that those clones are also returned
[18:29:05] <DaveMethvin> atrigent: i've updated the appendTo docs
[18:29:21] <atrigent> DaveMethvin: oh, cool!
[18:29:30] <atrigent> I actually just submitted a ticket for this, haha
[18:29:37] <atrigent> DaveMethvin: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10612
[18:29:51] <atrigent> I think it effects other similar functions too, which I list in the ticket
[18:31:18] <DaveMethvin> yep, i agree it affects all the backwards methods
[18:41:38] <atrigent> DaveMethvin: thanks!
[18:41:48] <DaveMethvin> sure
