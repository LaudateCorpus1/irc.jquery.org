[07:23:09] <dcherman> DaveMethvin gibson042: re: leaving out undefined from the IIFE (  yea....this is late ).  what about just instructing uglify to not mangle undefined?  tested it locally - it's "only" 44 bytes min/gz saved rather than 62, but you're not losing that safe undefined safety wheel then
[07:23:34] <DaveMethvin> dcherman nice idea 
[07:23:55] <gibson042> yeah, works for me
[07:24:30] <DaveMethvin> dcherman can you do a pull req?
[07:24:58] <dcherman> DaveMethvin: yea, it'll have to be later tonight.  probably shouldn't do pull reqs at work
[07:25:04] <dcherman> or at lunch
[07:25:05] <DaveMethvin> np
[09:24:39] <m_gol> "immutable" undefined
[09:25:05] <m_gol> well, I've learned a new meaning of "immutable" today
[09:26:19] <m_gol> this immutability would have sense only if undefined was a reserved word
[09:26:28] <m_gol> otherwise it's kinda sorta useless
[09:27:09] <DaveMethvin> but if undefined was a reserved word, ES5 couldn't run jQuery
[09:28:29] <m_gol> yeah
[09:28:37] <m_gol> I just don't understand why pretend
[09:29:03] <m_gol> or maybe I'm missing some specific use case
[09:29:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's like "Don't touch my sister, but hey her twin sister is fine"
[09:31:01] <m_gol> :)

[15:46:03] <MrDHat> Are there any good first bugs in jquery?
[16:10:28] <m_gol> MrDHat: hard to tell, jQuery is a mature library so most bugs are not very simple, especially those ones that are long open
[16:11:12] <m_gol> you might look for newly reported ones here: http://bugs.jquery.com/report/400 if you want
[16:15:56] <ajpiano> or you can work on closing jquery bugs that aren't necessarily on jquery core itself, but rather in other jquery libraries, or in the documentation or websites
[16:17:22] <m_gol> is it just me or is GitHub commit view sort-of broken?
[16:17:29] <m_gol> see e.g. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/ac9cad19fa0473315489ee952ba73afdaeb80386
[16:17:30] <b-ot> m_gol: Timmy Willison (1d 6h ago): Add onevar to jshintrc, but remove the option for linting the concatenated file
[16:17:45] <m_gol> line numbers don't too good e.g.
[16:34:41] <m_gol> * don't look good
[19:16:14] <m_gol> why is bugs.jquery.com soooo slow today? :(
[19:18:34] <m_gol> and by slow I mean "doesn't even load most of the time"
[19:19:29] <DaveMethvin> m_gol the bug tracker has its ups and downs, it had been behaving pretty well recently
[19:19:47] <DaveMethvin> i think it's on a server with some other stuff, maybe that's slowing it down
[19:19:53] <DaveMethvin> gnarf would know better
