[05:07:55] <olavk> I have a question regarding higher-order functions in the jQuery documentation. Is this the right place?
[05:17:37] <jaubourg> could be
[05:17:40] <jaubourg> depends on the question
[05:27:08] <olavk> I am looking at the xml documentation file. Arguments which are functions are usually represented as type="Function" but sometimes type="Callback". I wonder if the documentation could be made more specific so the function signatures were specified in the type, eg. type="Function(EventHandler):void" or something like that.
[05:29:09] <olavk> The signatures are sometimes specified in the argument *name*, eg. <argument name="handler(eventObject)" type="Function">
[05:32:27] <scott_gonzalez> olavk: I would suspect that we cannot put the signature into the type.
[05:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be like <input type="text(maxlength=4)">
[05:33:45] <mikesherov> .
[05:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> olavk: Can't you build the signature anyway? Using the entry/signature/argument nodes?
[05:40:23] <olavk> I can more or less guess the signature of the function-arguments, I just wonder if it would be valuable to express the precise types in an unambiguous standard way. For example I can guess from the argument name "handler(eventObject)" that the argument to the callback is an EventObject, but the xml doesn't specifically say so.
[05:43:43] <olavk> The documentation does precisely state the types of "first level" parameters and return type, but not the types of parameters and return types in higher-order functions. I could use this, since I'm generating interface files from the xml. I can add the precise higher-order types on my side, but I would if it would be valuable to push this back into the actual jquery documentation.
[05:44:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see what you're saying.
[05:44:38] <scott_gonzalez> You can determine the signature of .bind(), but not of the callback that it accepts.
[05:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ^^
[05:46:34] <scott_gonzalez> olavk: This will be solved. If you're interested in helping, rworth should be able to give you all the info you need to help.
[05:46:40] <rworth> yeah
[05:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> We're actually in the middle of improving the XML: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/Docs2xml
[05:47:01] <rworth> Let me pull up an example of the new schema, see if this is already adressed
[05:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-docs
[05:47:55] <rworth> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-docs/blob/master/jquery-ui/accordion/accordion.xml#L88
[05:48:04] <rworth> olavk: is that what you're looking for?
[05:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> I think that solves it specifically for events, but not general high-order functions.
[05:49:20] <scott_gonzalez> How will we document .each()?
[05:49:56] <rworth> ok, so for example https://github.com/jquery/jquery-docs/blob/master/jquery/jQuery.ajax/jQuery.ajax.xml#L32 doesn't have that
[05:50:11] <rworth> is that a good example?
[05:53:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's a good example.
[05:53:14] <scott_gonzalez> Any function that receives a function as a parameter.
[05:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> Events do that, but in a very different way.
[05:57:14] <rworth> ok, so this seems to be covered in a draft spec here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-docs/blob/master/spec.xml
[05:57:23] <rworth> clearly we need to work it out in implementation
[05:58:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the comment for events says "same implementation as Function (arguments, return)"
[05:58:40] <scott_gonzalez> olavk: Interested in helping figure this out and get it implemented?
[05:59:34] <jzaefferer> So glad this is finally getting addressed. A few years back my attempts to get callback signatures documented never went anywhere.
[05:59:53] <rworth> scott_gonzalez: can you open in issue in that repo?
[06:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> Sure

[06:04:02] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2 on jquery-docs, reported by scottgonzalez (20.261s ago): Parameter Listing for Higher-Order Functions
[06:04:43] <olavk> I could try if I can be useful. What kind of help do you need?
[06:05:21] <rworth> are you starting from existing XML?
[06:07:59] <jzaefferer> olavk: You could take one of the example xml files in the repo, add the signature markup, then extend the xslt to output those elements as html
[06:08:18] <jzaefferer> If you're not familiar with xslt, just add the markup, that would still be helpful
[06:09:20] <olavk> OK, I'm looking into it
[06:33:15] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone know where DaveMethvin is? Sick? Vacation?
[06:38:50] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[06:58:34] <olavk> rworth: Is there a spec/schema for how to document the parameters for HOF's, or do we need to define that first? In spec.xml there is an example with having <argument>-elements as children of an <option type="Function>-element. I assume arguments could be children of <argument type="Function"> in the same way?
[06:59:34] <rworth> yeah
[06:59:53] <rworth> it may be up to you to figure out something that works :)
[07:13:30] <olavk> There may be an issue with *returning* functions. Since "return" is an attribute there is not room for substructures. Return could be changed to an element (e.g <return type="String|Function...">) but that would be a big change?
[08:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Is the dev.jquery.com redirect down for good or just temporary while we switch servers?
[08:46:27] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez where did it redirect to?
[08:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> bugs.
[08:46:39] <scott_gonzalez> It was the old Trac server.
[08:47:06] <danheberden> ... and you need the old bug server?
[08:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> No, there are just lots of legacy links.
[08:47:42] <danheberden> :/
[08:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> For example, any old jQuery UI bugs that link to jQuery bugs will link to dev.
[08:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure there are lots of other links across the Internet too.
[08:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> Not a huge deal since people should smart enough to figure out the correct URL.
[08:49:03] <scott_gonzalez> Just wondering if it dev. was gone for good.
[08:49:33] <danheberden> that data is still there, but all the services have been shutdown
[08:50:35] <scott_gonzalez> It was just a redirect to bugs.
[08:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> To keep the old links working.
[08:51:18] <danheberden> but those same old bugs are in the new trac, ya?
[08:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[08:51:24] <danheberden> so we could setup some redirects if we wanted
[08:51:33] <scott_gonzalez> Right, that's what used to be there :-)
[08:51:46] <danheberden> oh - if it was just config we can pull that
[08:51:54] <danheberden> i was thinking... like... serving old bugs
[08:52:10] <danheberden> and then i was like shaking my hands violently making the 'ewww ewww' sound
[08:52:12] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, no. It was just a redirect of all dev. URLs to bugs.
[08:52:23] <danheberden> coo - lemme yank that out
[08:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[08:58:24] <danheberden> though i think it's buried in php... maybe
[09:03:04] <scott_gonzalez> If it's down until the new servers are setup, that's probably fine.
[09:38:33] <olavk> rworth: I tried adding the HOF parameters to the jQuery.ajax.xml sample file, and update the xslt so it shows the types more or less human readable. Eg. for the dataFilter option the type is shown as "Type: function(Object, String) => Object". Don't know if the arrow makes sense.
[09:47:16] <davidmurdoch> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2rc1.js is rc2
[09:47:25] <davidmurdoch> nevermind
[09:47:31] <davidmurdoch> read it wrong
[09:47:37] <davidmurdoch> ignore that
[09:52:45] <rworth> olavk: you have a fork?
[09:55:09] <olavk> rworth: I think so. Not a github wizard yet :-)
[09:56:35] <rworth> what's your github userid?
[10:08:45] <davidmurdoch> Not sure if this goes to you guys, the UI team, or if this is intended behavior: http://jsfiddle.net/musicisair/YUkZw/
[10:09:23] <davidmurdoch> deep cloning an input that has a UI datepicker doesn't work as expected.
