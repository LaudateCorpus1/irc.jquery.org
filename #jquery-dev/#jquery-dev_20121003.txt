[08:57:45] <Gaurav_> Hello
[08:57:56] <Gaurav_> I am looking for some help on TestSwarm
[09:00:11] <jzaefferer> Guest93204: On what specifically?
[09:00:28] <Guest93204> I have managed to setup the server and connect client to it
[09:00:38] <Guest93204> the client runs the tests I want it to as well
[09:00:53] <Guest93204> but the server does not seem to be picking up the results from the client
[09:01:15] <Guest93204> I tried searching on the wiki but nothing seems to be resolving the problem
[09:17:49] <Guest93204> Has someone faced a similar type of a problem before?
[09:18:34] <jzaefferer> Guest93204: hard to tell what the problem is based on that description
[09:18:34] <Guest93204> I have also verified that the client does send a response back to the server with the test results. For some reason the server does not seem to be picking the results up
[09:19:10] <Guest93204> Could I provide some more information to you jzaefferer
