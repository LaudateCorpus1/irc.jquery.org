[06:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa. When did Chrome get a ruler while inspecting elements?
[06:47:52] <shoky> a while ago :p then they changed it to be off by default
[06:50:20] <shoky> and now canary's went and gotten rid of the main devtools tab icons
[06:50:51] <paul_irish_> is that bad?
[06:51:02] <paul_irish_> most people seem to be okay with it, but that surprises me
[06:51:03] <shoky> no, i think i like it :) 
[06:51:08] <paul_irish_> :) okay cool
[06:51:09] <shoky> but i'm not 100% sure :D
[06:51:14] <paul_irish_> there is also an option to turn those back on
[06:51:23] <paul_irish_> i do think the ruler should be on by default 
[06:51:23] <shoky> ah, perfect then :P
[06:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> A while ago, huh? I guess that's what happens when auto update breaks :-/
[07:53:16] <DaveMethvin> i won't be at the meeting today ... out shopping :)
[09:06:29] <gibson042> .
[20:01:46] <DaveMethvin> dmethvin-nexus: you there?
[20:02:04] <dmethvin-nexus> Yep
[21:13:53] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: dare i recommend a nexus and _one_ nick?
[21:13:58] <danheberden> *bouncer
[21:13:59] <danheberden> lol
[21:14:08] <danheberden> was reading -nexus when thinking "bouncer" - silly brain
[21:14:58] <snover> well a bouncer is kind of like a nexus for your chats
