[08:11:13] <mikesherov> mkwst: you there?
[08:11:23] <mkwst> mikesherov: hi
[08:11:46] <mikesherov> What's the likelihood that we can get a UseCounter into Blink to measure which version of jQuery people are using?
[08:13:15] <mikesherov> I'd love to know what percent of sites use both jQueryUI and a version of jQuery less than 1.6. This may be out of scope for Blink, but it would be useful for me :-)
[08:14:20] <mikesherov> mkwst: ^
[08:15:10] <mkwst> mikesherov: yeah, i tried to respond to that from my phone earlier, but it apparently didn't get through. :)
[08:15:53] <mikesherov> also, just saw the blink intent to deprecate document.allâ€¦ don't know if you saw this or if there is any other overall: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/bg182625%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#legacyAPIs
[08:15:59] <mkwst> file a bug! it's not really how we imagined UseCounter being used, but it'd be interesting and potentially valuable information. i'm not entirely sure how we'd implement it, and i'm not sure it's something we actually _want_ to implement, but it's a good discussion to have.
[08:16:10] <mkwst> mikesherov: that's why i sent the intent. :)
[08:16:11] <mkwst> i don
[08:16:22] <mkwst> I don't think we implement anything else on that list in blink.
[08:16:29] <mkwst> if i'm wrong, we should kill those apis too. :)
[08:16:46] <mikesherov> cool. I love nothing more than slashing and burning things
[08:17:09] <mkwst> mikesherov: seriously.
[08:17:43] <mikesherov> I'll send the bug about jQuery in UseCounter, and if I don't here anything for a bit I'll ping you
[08:18:18] <mkwst> sounds good. cc me :)

[11:44:55] <fearphage> concerning QUnit, is there a right way to wrap QUnit.test? I want to do methods.forEach(function(method) { QUnit.test('dynamic string', function() { document[method] = catpants; assert(things); } });
[16:29:31] <kripper> hi, one short question plz.
[16:29:41] <kripper> I have  page P1, loading P2, which then loads P1' (same URL as P1).
[16:30:00] <kripper> P1 and P1' are adding a pageinit event on the page-div, which is only fired the first time.
[16:30:06] <kripper> is this ok?
[16:30:20] <kripper> It seems the pageinit event of P1' is not triggered because the same URL is cached after loading P1
[16:32:08] <nschonni> kripper: that question is better asked in #jquery
[16:32:39] <kripper> its JQM related
[16:33:01] <kripper> thx

[23:49:03] <JamesMGreene> Anyone know any clever hacks for the native Error objects?  I'm trying to polfill the old `window.onerror` function to match the HTML5 spec version (adds `columnNumber` and `error` to the args) but I can't seem to get it working in oldIE, newIE, or Safari.  It works in Firefox, and Chrome and Opera don't need it because they've already implemented the HTML5 spec version
[23:49:14] <JamesMGreene> http://jsfiddle.net/JamesMGreene/MYgpY/
[23:50:51] <JamesMGreene> (the fiddle isn't trying to polyfill it, just to capture the last error thrown and unhandled by hijacking the Error prototypes' `toString` and `valueOf` methods)
[23:55:15] <JamesMGreene> (which I was hoping the browsers would be courteous enough to invoke when formulating the `message` to pass as the first arg of the `window.onerror` handler... apparently oldIE and Safari are not)
