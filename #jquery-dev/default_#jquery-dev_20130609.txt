[15:03:04] <rwaldron> also, you wrote "querySelector" where you meant "querySelectorAll", hopefully readers see past that and to the point
[15:03:11] <rwaldron> but I'm not sure I follow the point
[15:03:17] <rwaldron> unless I'm missing some key aspect?
[15:04:16] <timmywil> i meant both, but I think I see the difference now
[15:04:36] <timmywil> http://jsfiddle.net/sAH93/1/
[15:06:11] <timmywil> the wording was confusing. It seems like .find[All] should operate on its context object the same way as qs[a]
[15:06:29] <timmywil> I'm still not sure why .find operates on the whole tree
[16:24:05] <gnarf> just ran into the project lead for selenium in my hotel: http://www.seleniumconf.org/ apparently happening in boston this week :)
[16:50:43] <rwaldron> gnarf jason huggins?
[16:51:02] <rwaldron> (i dont know if he's the project lead, but he's something)
[17:06:29] <gnarf> yeah
[17:10:49] <rwaldron> gnarf if you see him again tell him I said "hi!"
[17:10:57] <gnarf> will do :)
[17:11:04] <gnarf> just met him in the elevator
[17:11:10] <gnarf> he was carrying a selenium shirt
[17:11:18] <gnarf> and i was like "hey - selenium!" :)
[17:11:50] <rwaldron> ah!
[17:11:51] <rwaldron> gotcha
[17:11:58] <rwaldron> btw, I will be at the office tomorrow
[17:12:06] <rwaldron> i decided i didnt want to drive back tonight
[18:29:02] <JamesMGreene> Anyone know how soon after the conference the videos will be available for replay?
[18:43:30] <JamesMGreene> ajpiano rworth DaveMethvin?
[18:52:59] <gnarf> JamesMGreene: historically it's been a few weeks
[18:58:37] <ajpiano> i think we're trying to do it faster this year
[19:00:15] <JamesMGreene> Either sounds fine, was just curious
[19:00:29] <JamesMGreene> Assumed it might be decently fast given Richard's email
[19:59:24] <rwaldron> JamesMGreene ajpiano <troll> if it's anything like previous years, you're better off getting someone to take 8mm video, get in a time machine and mail it to yourself in 1985</troll>
[20:01:02] <JamesMGreene> I'm not sure if 1-year-old me would understand jQuery conference film   ;)
[20:02:09] <JamesMGreene> P.S. Any experts here at digesting W3C specs?  Struggling to grok WTF is enabled in http://www.w3.org/TR/clipboard-apis/
[20:03:16] <snover> what do you mean “enabled”
[20:13:35] <JamesMGreene> snover: Well, I can see that it allows devs to capture paste data on a page
[20:14:08] <JamesMGreene> snover: But I want to know what it enables devs to do in terms of manipulating data on `copy`
[20:14:29] <snover> i bet you would!
[20:14:34] <JamesMGreene> And I'm just not sure I can figure that out given the existing spec  o_O
[20:15:04] <JamesMGreene> snover: Well, it's a touchy topic obviously due to the potential for clipboard poisoning
[20:15:22] <JamesMGreene> snover: but I want to leverage it for legitimate purposes :)  https://github.com/zeroclipboard/ZeroClipboard
[20:15:32] <snover> man, get a room with that thing already
[20:15:41] <JamesMGreene> lol
[20:16:03] <snover> the spec is mostly a reverse-engineering of the existing microsoft dhtml clipboard api
[20:16:10] <snover> which is referenced at the bottom
[20:19:51] <JamesMGreene> yeah, I'm somewhat familiar with that from the external view
[20:19:59] <JamesMGreene> including it's super annoying permissions prompts
[20:20:03] <JamesMGreene> its*
[20:28:18] <JamesMGreene> Maybe I can convince jaffa to figure it out ;)
[20:52:11] <JamesMGreene> All the same, I assume it will be of no use to me as it likely cannot be manually triggered without security prompts or whatever
