[05:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: rworth and I are available all day to discuss sites.
[05:35:56] <rworth> ya
[05:36:05] <DaveMethvin> k, how bout now?
[05:37:13] <DaveMethvin> actually how about 9am rworth scott_gonzalez, that will give the coffee time to kick in
[05:37:24] <rworth> that works
[05:37:25] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds good.
[05:38:15] <Krinkle> ie6 is still crashin'
[05:38:21] <Krinkle> browserstack vm at least
[06:18:04] <David_Souther> I'm still getting intermittent crashes on bugs.jquery.com

[07:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a list of all the custom selectors in core?
[07:25:41] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I found it: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/jquery-selector-extensions/
[07:25:51] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, that's a lot :-)
[08:29:07] <Krinkle> Did someone hack http://jslint.com/ ?
[08:29:14] <Krinkle> boy does that look fucked up
[08:29:21] <Krinkle> pixelated img on top
[08:29:26] <Krinkle> Crockford what did you do?
[08:29:45] <ajpiano> i think someone hacked it into being jshint
[08:29:47] <ajpiano> :p

[08:30:00] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on JSLint by douglascrockford (1d, 3h ago): new look
[08:30:25] <Krinkle> it looks nicer though
[08:30:28] <Krinkle> but the header is ugly
[08:30:47] <Krinkle> hm.. the img on github is fine
[08:30:53] <ajpiano> just think of it as a testament to the internet of the 1990s
[08:30:54] <Krinkle> maybe my cache is bad
[08:31:17] <Krinkle> some image jpg optimizer
[08:31:22] <scott_gonzalez> Testament to the 90s is right, it uses <center> :-)
[08:31:22] <bot-t> (44 hours 20 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell scott_gonzalez to check out https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/783
[08:31:23] <Krinkle> ah, indeed. not my cache
[08:31:26] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (1d, 20h ago): fixes #10877, Make outerWidth/Height a setter
[09:00:14] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: something is up at browserstack
[09:00:40] <Krinkle> only one browser is able to start at a time
[09:00:52] <Krinkle> and even that one is being killed without the script giving that command
[09:01:16] <Krinkle> chrome 19 was online just now, I checked the log, no terminate cmd was given but the vm did disconnect
[09:02:40] <Krinkle> lol wut: https://twitter.com/#!/nedsbeds/status/203058077228990465
[09:02:41] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from nedsbeds: viewing someone else's session on @browserstack... had a conversation in the address bar... ★ http://bit.ly/LlQ60N
[09:03:23] <DaveMethvin> that's not good
[09:04:07] <Krinkle> this is also bad https://twitter.com/#!/adamholwerda/status/200607898034909184/photo/1/large
[09:04:08] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from adamholwerda: @browserstack Or maybe this? http://t.co/mvidakBK ★ http://bit.ly/JKdZTK
[09:04:09] <Krinkle> \r
[09:04:30] <Krinkle> probably some windows dev who edited a browserstack asset and inserted a CR
[09:04:33] <Krinkle> :D
[09:04:49] <Krinkle> which surprisingly json_encode in PHP doesn't appear to handle very well
[10:22:26] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: scott_gonzalez: dimension setters?
[10:24:07] <mikesherov_> I'll just leave this here again: most of the work is to get .width() and .height() to ignore box-sizing and set content-width and content-height
[10:24:16] <mikesherov_> that *needs* to happen
[10:24:26] <mikesherov_> the other setters are just gravy
[10:24:42] <mikesherov_> and actually, the refactor makes dimensions smaller itself
[10:25:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm +1 on landing it.
[10:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> for 1.8
[10:25:34] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: how many bytes does it remove from ui?
[10:25:44] <scott_gonzalez> let me check
[10:25:51] <DaveMethvin> looking at the pr now
[10:26:01] <mikesherov_> thanks DaveMethvin!
[10:27:12] <scott_gonzalez>     417851     (-1140)  dist/jquery-ui.js
[10:27:12] <scott_gonzalez>     224614      (-681)  dist/jquery-ui.min.js
[10:27:12] <scott_gonzalez>      58684      (-192)  dist/jquery-ui.min.js.gz
[10:27:36] <scott_gonzalez> About double what you add to core :-)
[10:27:49] <scott_gonzalez> And it makes it work properly for box-sizing.
[10:27:56] <mikesherov_> yeah
[10:31:24] <DaveMethvin> okay i think the benefits are there, just wish it wasn't so big!
[10:31:29] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov_:
[10:31:39] <danheberden> that's....
[10:31:49] <mikesherov_> yeah, I mean, +101 isn't great
[10:32:04] <mikesherov_> but I think with it well factored, we can make the gains elsewhere
[10:32:06] <gibson042> mikesherov_: I think you can roll the `parseFloat`s into jQuery.css
[10:32:08] <danheberden> but the value
[10:32:55] <mikesherov_> gibson042, probably
[10:33:06] <mikesherov_> I just want this to land before doing more stuff
[10:33:16] <scott_gonzalez> DO IT!
[10:33:41] <DaveMethvin> i feel like scott_gonzalez is dressed in a devil suit  holding a pitchfork :D
[10:33:46] <mikesherov_> hahaha
[10:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> That's how I get stuff done.
[10:34:04] <scott_gonzalez> I put it on right before the meeting :-)
[10:34:27] <mikesherov_> only one small change davemethvin before you land: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/783/files#L0R347
[10:34:28] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (1d, 22h ago): fixes #10877, Make outerWidth/Height a setter
[10:34:41] <mikesherov_> that comment needs to move to the augmentWidthOrHeight function
[10:36:58] <gibson042> ok; I'm switching to +1 on this change
[10:37:41] <gibson042> we can shrink it later, but it's important to be solid in the face of box-sizing
[10:39:21] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: updated the PR with the comment change
[10:40:09] <DaveMethvin> whew, moving the comment didn't make it bigger :D
[10:40:30] <mikesherov_> HAHA
[10:40:53] <mikesherov_> btw, are when using 1.8 as the pull target or master?
[10:41:00] <mikesherov_> we*
[10:41:08] <DaveMethvin> master
[10:41:16] <mikesherov_> OK, tell everyone that
[10:42:47] <DaveMethvin> SQUASH!

[10:47:53] <mikesherov_> NOOOOOOO
[10:48:34] <mikesherov_> OK, I gotta run guys. Thanks for merging DaveMethvin:
[10:49:44] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: any ideas? http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/69/console
[10:50:45] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: "Cannot allocate memory"
[10:51:08] <DaveMethvin> well get some more memory then! :D
[10:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> HAH! Check out my support test: $( "<a>" ).outerWidth(1).jquery
[11:00:42] <elguapo99> could someone look at this question please:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10690213/jquery-sliding-questionair
[11:00:48] <elguapo99> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10690213/jquery-sliding-questionair
[11:03:10] <scott_gonzalez> ?topic @elguapo99
[11:03:25] <scott_gonzalez> Oh no, where's bot-t?
[11:03:49] <scott_gonzalez> elguapo99: Please use #jquery for support questions.
[11:06:12] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..that test isn't working.
[11:07:43] <scott_gonzalez> Bah, I'm too fast.
[11:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-git isn't updated yet :-P
[11:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> umm...actually, jquery-git.js says "Date: Wed Apr 18 17:21:01 UTC 2012"
[11:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-ui-git.js is also from 4/18
[11:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden gnarf: shit's busted
[11:09:15] <danheberden> k
[11:10:16] <danheberden> unable to locate tools.jar
[11:10:21] <danheberden> build.xml does not exist
[11:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[11:10:51] <scott_gonzalez> grunt build :-)
[11:11:04] <danheberden> funny how not using ant anymore messed up the build process :p
[11:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[11:13:30] <danheberden> lets home the bugs box doesn't die a fiery death installing node
[11:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> Does UI build before core?
[11:17:02] <snover> danheberden: ant?!
[11:17:20] <danheberden> snover - moo
[11:17:59] <danheberden> also, i have no idea why i said hat
[11:18:01] <danheberden> *that
[11:18:48] <snover> apt-get moo
[11:36:18] <scott_gonzalez> :button -> button,[type=button] ?
[11:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> or button,input[type=button] ?
[11:36:41] <scott_gonzalez> Is the latter faster?
[11:38:19] <danheberden> i haven't tested recently, but specifying the tag's name had been faster in chrome 10/11 ff3/4/5
[11:38:36] * scott_gonzalez should RTFM
[11:38:45] <danheberden> or tias
[11:38:52] <scott_gonzalez> An equivalent selector to $(":button") using valid CSS is $("button, input[type='button']"). http://api.jquery.com/button-selector/
[11:39:25] <danheberden> lol, you said butt
[11:39:48] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, Do I need to be quoting?
[11:39:58] <scott_gonzalez> [type='button'] instead of [type=button]?
[11:40:04] <danheberden> you don't have to quote, no
[11:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> ok, good
[12:47:16] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Thoughts on exposing the add/removeClass logic for other attributes that support space-delimited values?
[12:47:46] <DaveMethvin> like lang?
[12:48:18] <scott_gonzalez> lang supports multiple values?
[12:48:41] <DaveMethvin> what's the crazy syntax that needs |=
[12:48:47] <DaveMethvin> john took it out years ago
[12:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> You mean en vs. en-US?
[12:49:31] <DaveMethvin> right http://ejohn.org/blog/selectors-that-people-actually-use/
[12:49:45] <DaveMethvin> so not spaces
[12:50:03] <DaveMethvin> so which attributes need this?
[12:50:12] <DaveMethvin> and when you say expose do you mean a public interface?
[12:50:15] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to avoid that
[12:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> aria-describedby uses it
[12:51:04] <DaveMethvin> how much code is it?
[12:51:18] <DaveMethvin> do you need to set it?
[12:51:44] <scott_gonzalez> A lot? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes.js#L39-107
[12:52:49] <scott_gonzalez> We need the equivalent of .addClass(), .removeClass(), .hasClass()
[12:53:10] <DaveMethvin> right but is your use case that  you must both obtain and set arbitrary space-separated lists of words on a regular basis?
[12:53:55] <scott_gonzalez> We need to add/remove a value for tooltips.
[12:54:02] <scott_gonzalez> The element may or may not already have a value.
[12:54:10] <scott_gonzalez> If it does, we need to add.
[12:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> Regardless of whether core adds this, we'll need to do it ourselves for now.
[12:54:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if there's even a clean API to expose.
[12:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> The class API is sane, but it's attribute-specific.
[12:55:20] <DaveMethvin> and it's not that much faster
[12:55:31] <DaveMethvin> if we did expose this i would say screw classList
[12:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I meant jQuery's class API, not classList :-P
[12:55:53] <DaveMethvin> and ppl are bugging us all the time to add that code path for some reason
[12:56:10] <DaveMethvin> well if you could just pass another property for "className" it would be reusable?
[12:56:22] <scott_gonzalez> Probably :-)
[12:56:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well...
[12:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> It'd have to go through .attr()?
[12:56:57] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nevermind.
[12:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> prop = attr here
[12:57:11] <scott_gonzalez> guaranteed strings
[12:57:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah, prop/attr confusion ftw for ONCE
[12:59:32] <DaveMethvin> okay scott_gonzalez i'm stuck on tryna get wp installed ... actually it's a php config error but i've tried all the things google recommends so i am going to need a reboot
[12:59:57] <scott_gonzalez> heh, ok
[13:22:34] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: why remove usage of :button / :input in jquery-ui? For performance? Or other reasons
[13:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> Because they're deprecated.
[13:23:51] <Krinkle> oh?
[13:24:10] <Krinkle> I don't see a big warning on the api docs
[13:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9400
[13:25:41] <Krinkle> ok
[13:55:38] <DaveMethvin> well scott_gonzalez I'm about 90 minutes into the 5 minute install ... unfortunately it doesn't like something about my php setup
[13:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:56:05] <DaveMethvin> every other part went as planned, and i was thinking this was gonna be easy
[13:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> I can help on Skype with screen sharing.
[13:56:44] <DaveMethvin> well it comes down to this message: Your PHP installation appears to be missing the MySQL extension which is required by WordPress.
[13:56:59] <DaveMethvin> which generally means there's some stuff to be set up in php.ini
[13:57:01] <DaveMethvin> which i've done
[13:57:21] <DaveMethvin> but then when i look at the php config it says it's getting php.ini from a dir where there isn't even a php.ini
[13:57:29] <DaveMethvin> so i am not totally sure it's getting the one i edited
[13:57:36] <DaveMethvin> but there aren't any others on the drive
[13:57:55] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[13:58:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and the internet is strewn with threads of people having the same issues, of course with no simple single solution
[13:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> Where is your php.ini?
[13:59:43] <DaveMethvin> C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP
[13:59:58] <DaveMethvin> phpinfo says it's in c:\windows
[14:00:06] <DaveMethvin> which is like a default location
[14:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> Try moving it to c:\windows just to test.
[14:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> That's where I kept mine while I used Windows.
[14:02:18] <DaveMethvin> nope, it's definitely using the one in PHP
[14:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> So it's just a problem of loading the appropriate .dll?
[14:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like I've had that problem before.
[14:07:27] <DaveMethvin> i feel like it might be taht
[14:07:28] <DaveMethvin> that
[14:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> I think I had to copy one or two .dll files from some directory to the system directory.
[14:07:36] <DaveMethvin> either a path problem or a dll version mismatch
[14:08:28] <DaveMethvin> well once i start heading down this road, the most likely resolution if it doesn't work is to reinstall apache/php/mysql
[14:09:47] <scott_gonzalez> Or buy a MacBook :-P
[14:10:29] <DaveMethvin> honestly
[14:10:46] <DaveMethvin> that's the problem with open source dev on windows, it's not common enough for anyone to make it easy
[14:10:56] <DaveMethvin> altho github just came out with a windows client
[14:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> dinner time
[14:41:27] <elguapo99> scott_gonzalez: sorry for being off line... we were having a network glitch...
[14:41:39] <elguapo99> could someone look at this question please:http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10690213/jquery-sliding-questionair

[14:57:39] <snover> #jquery is the support chat.
[14:58:21] <elguapo99> thanks...  so what goes on here?
[14:58:39] <elguapo99> never mind... I thin I know
[15:25:49] <DaveMethvin> Wordpress achievement unlocked
[15:26:03] <DaveMethvin> 3 hour setup, 2 minute install
[15:39:43] <nacin> DaveMethvin: :-) Let's see what we can do to make that just a bit easier for you.
[16:06:56] <DaveMethvin> nacin, it was my php setup ... afaict my windows setup was pointing to a non-existent file and it seemed to be using defaults
[16:07:35] <nacin> DaveMethvin: hah. nice.
[16:07:57] <DaveMethvin> i used sysinternals process monitor to look for php.ini being opened and put it where it would be found
[16:08:35] <nacin> phpinfo() wouldn't tell you where it was loading it from?
[16:08:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it said c:\windows and there was no php.ini there
[16:09:01] <DaveMethvin> and even when i put it there it wasn't being used
[16:09:13] <DaveMethvin> turned out the apache setup had it at c:\php5
[16:09:45] <nacin> php will use different .ini files depending on the web server, over CLI, etc. Always a good time.
[19:21:47] <rizall> there is someone who can help me on my website with javascript
[19:22:39] <rizall> only to guide me in what I'm doing wrong and tell me where I should be looking

[19:23:50] <rizall> ok tks
