[04:03:50] <ckoekemoer> $.fx.step can anyone tell me what "fx.step" and "fx.now" is
[04:47:44] <louisremi> ckoekemoer: isn't it written in the doc? What do you want to know exactly?
[06:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman, DaveMethvin, JohnResig, jzaefferer, kswedberg, paul_irish, timmywil, wycats: style question
[06:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> the closing of a IIFE
[06:40:39] <kswedberg> hey scott
[06:40:41] <scott_gonzalez> })()
[06:40:43] <scott_gonzalez> }())
[06:40:49] <timmywil> })() is what I do
[06:40:57] <kswedberg> timmywil: +1.
[06:41:38] <kswedberg> seems })() is de facto standard, although pretty sure papacrock does }())
[06:42:03] <timmywil> ben_alman is a good man to ask as well
[06:42:11] <timmywil> oh he's on there
[06:42:20] <timmywil> you're the same color!
[06:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, core has all })(), UI is split, almost perfectly in half
[06:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> wondering if it makes sense to switch to }())
[06:47:15] <jzaefferer> I'm fine with the crock on that one
[06:47:20] <jzaefferer> using that elsewhere already
[06:48:30] <timmywil> i'd lean towards })() to match core
[06:48:44] <tbranyen> i like })() fwiwi
[06:48:56] <tbranyen> its more obvious what you're oding
[06:49:09] <tbranyen> (function() { }) makes it an expression () invokes it
[06:52:26] <jzaefferer> a bit of background on the jslint thing: http://www.jameswiseman.com/blog/2011/02/15/jslint-messages-move-the-invocation-into-the-parens-that-contain-the-function/
[06:52:56] <jzaefferer> still doesn't provide background on why that's recommended
[06:53:02] <jzaefferer> nothing here either: http://www.jslint.com/lint.html
[06:53:44] <jzaefferer> I don't really care enough, so going with jslint here seems to be the less annoying choice in the long run
[07:00:30] <ben_alman> wat
[09:15:44] <ben_alman> anyone know who i can talk to about jquery logo / brand usage guidelines?
[09:16:48] <ben_alman> all i can find is https://groups.google.com/group/jquery-en/browse_thread/thread/3f560bb02d2bf50b/d48c57bac06ea2ad?pli=1
[09:17:05] <ben_alman> which is for a way outdated logo
[09:44:39] <kswedberg> ben_alman: http://jquery.org/about/ scroll down to "Logos"
[09:45:22] <ben_alman> right
[09:45:30] <ben_alman> good to know
[09:45:41] <ben_alman> yeah, it would be in conjunction with a bocoup jquery training
[09:45:52] <ben_alman> of course, we do give 10% of the profit to jquery
[09:46:27] <ben_alman> i emailed richard
[09:46:35] <ben_alman> i'm sure he'll let me know
[09:46:39] <kswedberg> are you planning to put the logo on t-shirts or something?
[09:46:50] <ben_alman> lol no, facebook ad for training
[09:47:26] <kswedberg> ok. the guidelines on the about page are, to put it mildly, vague
[09:47:30] <ben_alman> yeah
[09:47:40] <ben_alman> trainign isn't a physical product per se
[09:47:49] <ben_alman> but it's still something that we're selling
[09:49:09] <kswedberg> right. ultimately, I'm sure it would be no problem. but probably best to make sure anyway.
[09:49:48] <kswedberg> ^^ not speaking for the jQuery Projectâ„¢ ;-)
[09:49:56] <ben_alman> yeah i don't want jquery's crack legal team busting down our front door
[09:50:02] <kswedberg> lol
[09:50:11] <gnarf> richard? rworth? isn't he out of town/communication for a bit?
[09:50:42] <ben_alman> he's wrapping up a training today then i think going on vaca tomorrow
[09:50:52] <ben_alman> but maybe he can reply to me today, if i'm lucky
[09:52:45] <kswedberg> ben_alman: see my PM.
[10:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: yt?
[10:37:14] <walkingeyerobot> did jquery ever add on to Array.prototype? If they did, any idea when it stopped?
[10:50:35] <scott_gonzalez> never
[10:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: is it expected that this no longer adds a class? $( "<div>", { className: "foo" } )
[10:55:35] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: className isn't an attribute, but "class" works
[10:55:54] <DaveMethvin> it used to work when we let people get all confusy about props and attrs
[10:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:56:12] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[12:05:51] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: did DaveMethvin answer what you wanted to ask me?
[12:06:30] <scott_gonzalez> no, tabIndex should go through .prop()?
[12:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> or does it just depend on whether the browser natively supports tabIndex on specific elements?
[12:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> Safari is returning undefined using .attr( "tabIndex" ) on an h3
[12:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> but I just tested in Chrome and it returned the expected value
[12:08:45] <gnarf> it should be a prop
[12:08:47] <gnarf> i would assume
[12:08:53] <gnarf> since its domelement.tabIndex
[12:08:59] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: you probably want prop then.  attr('tabindex') won't get you default tabindex (that is, the tabindex of an element that doesn't have a tabindex attribute)
[12:09:28] <gnarf> attr is whatever is defined in the html as tabindex
[12:09:37] <timmywil> tru nuff
[12:10:18] <timmywil> actually, let me revise that.  that's the way it SHOULD work
[12:10:39] <timmywil> we left the tabIndex attrHook in there so it will actually get you tabIndex even if the attribute isn't there
[12:11:12] <timmywil> but it should be noted that that hook checks the focusability of an element
[12:11:22] <timmywil> if it can't be focused, tabindex will be undefined
[12:11:30] <timmywil> maybe that's what you're running into?
[12:11:33] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez
[12:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....now I'm getting different results
[12:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> now I'm really confused why this test is failing :-/
[12:13:30] <timmywil> link?
[12:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/accordion/accordion.html
[12:15:25] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: which test do you see failing?
[12:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> 14. accordion: methods: destroy
[12:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> in Safari only
[12:16:31] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=224&client_id=46
[12:21:19] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: what does accordion destroy do to tabindex?
[12:21:27] <timmywil> reset it?
[12:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> .removeAttr( "tabIndex" )
[12:25:24] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: is it consistent if everything uses attr?
[12:26:09] <timmywil> looks like you're getting -1, which shouldn't be possible
[12:29:57] <timmywil> ?tell scott_gonzalez: I'm not able to reproduce on my end, but add this somewhere and let me know if it fixes the problem: jQuery.propHooks.tabIndex = jQuery.attrHooks.tabIndex;
[12:29:57] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.

[13:37:39] <timmywil> lol, just a few lines ;)

[13:49:29] <rwaldron> i see how it is
[13:49:54] <rwaldron> the pull request queue is like ellis island in the 1910s
[13:50:05] <rwaldron> timmywil gets in because he's got privelege
[13:50:14] <DaveMethvin> it has tuberculosis?

[13:50:20] <rwaldron> :\
[13:50:47] <wycats> timmywil: do you know if cssHooks give you += for free?
[13:50:51] <DaveMethvin> i started to look at it a few days ago, i was gonna land some of yours b/c they were simple cleanups
[13:50:52] <rwaldron> i seriously need those data patches reviewed and landed before i can proceed with another ticket that relies on the same pieces of code
[13:51:03] <rwaldron> feel free to continue ignoring me
[13:51:13] <DaveMethvin> well that counts me out, i never do anything seriously :P
[13:51:21] <rwaldron> i'm using an xbox controller in a special build of Firefox 8 right now
[13:51:22] <rwaldron> and you're not
[13:51:38] <DaveMethvin> are you trying to make me feel guilty? you gottawork harder than that
[13:51:51] <DaveMethvin> something involving cruelty to kittens should work
[13:52:24] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: i'll take a look at them in about 10 minutes
[13:52:36] <rwaldron> don't sweat it, really...
[13:52:40] <rwaldron> its like moldy cheese

[14:21:12] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: what's your take on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/437 ?
[14:22:20] <DaveMethvin> per http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/ it is not on the list for normalization
[14:22:39] <DaveMethvin> so I'm inclined to avoid more overhead in .fix()
[14:25:21] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I like the concept, not the implementation
[14:25:31] <rwaldron> I like the idea of limiting the work load
[14:25:44] <rwaldron> but that feels too ad hoc
[14:25:57] <DaveMethvin> as does all of .fix() you insensitive clod! :P
[14:26:11] <rwaldron> Wow.
[14:26:17] <rwaldron> hehhe
[14:26:26] <DaveMethvin> but yeah i just hate to add another if htere
[14:26:27] <DaveMethvin> there
[14:26:37] <rwaldron> same here
[14:26:47] <rwaldron> i'd rather solve it via event prop hooks
[14:27:02] <rwaldron> or not at all if it's too messy
[14:27:09] <DaveMethvin> how about i ask the submitter to create a feature ticket for it, and close the pull?
[14:27:20] <DaveMethvin> we never promised to normalize those two
[14:27:21] <rwaldron> Good call

[15:04:29] <timmywil> adding chrome support makes no sense to me tho
[15:04:57] <timmywil> we have $.browser.webkit(chrome or safari) and $.browser.chrome now

[15:19:23] <jaubourg> hopefully, I'll have the work I wanted to do on usejs done soon... then I finish $.Callbacks :)
[15:19:41] <timmywil> jaubourg: nice
[15:19:47] <timmywil> I have to tackle sizzle
[15:19:49] <timmywil> next
[15:19:54] * timmywil runs away
[15:19:57] <jaubourg> never looked into it
[15:20:04] <jaubourg> that's cool :)
[15:20:29] <timmywil> I'm looking forward to seeing how $.Callbacks finishes out
[15:22:24] <jaubourg> hopefully fantastically
[15:22:44] <jaubourg> but heh, I'm not immune to failure sadly
[15:22:54] <timmywil> jaubourg: sure you are
[15:23:17] * jaubourg doesn't need to remind timmywil of the body background debacle :P
[15:23:51] <timmywil> I feel partly responsible for that
[15:23:53] <jaubourg> btw, we should re-put the body background in support... did we do that already?
[15:24:07] <timmywil> at least, for not fixing it right
[15:24:09] <jaubourg> you're not, you fixed my mess actually
[15:24:19] <timmywil> then you fixed it better
[15:24:34] <jaubourg> then we still need your fix :P
[15:24:41] <timmywil> lol
[15:24:44] <timmywil> back and forth
[15:24:48] <jaubourg> heh
[15:24:56] <jaubourg> welcome to jQuery ;)
[15:24:57] <timmywil> so we do need the background: none after all?
[15:25:05] <jaubourg> yep, let me dig the bug
[15:25:22] <DaveMethvin> you guys sound like gangsters making veiled threats: you got a nice body there ... shame to see it go into the background
[15:25:37] <jaubourg> hahahaha
[15:25:41] <timmywil> I have a test for it that used to fail and no longer fails, so
[15:25:42] <jaubourg> timmywil: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9028
[15:25:43] <timmywil> haha
[15:25:45] <DaveMethvin> ok i landed everyting i feel safe doing
[15:26:23] <jaubourg> basically, we need the div trick when the body exists for Opera, then we need the background none for IE
[15:26:31] <jaubourg> \o/
[15:26:37] <jaubourg> me and my genius ideas ><
[15:27:21] <jaubourg> hang on... are we sure we won't re-introduce the bug in Opera
[15:27:25] <jaubourg> god I hate this thing
[15:27:52] <timmywil> that's my worry
[15:28:19] <timmywil> but I'm saying I have that same test case from the fiddle for the IE bug in the test suite
[15:28:38] <timmywil> it used to crash so I dunno what's different
[15:28:53] <jaubourg> apparentely it's limited to IE8 winxp
[15:30:49] <timmywil> oh, this is different, now it only crashes when doing the iframe refresh.  well that's a tough one to test :P
[15:32:18] <timmywil> we may be okay adding back the background: "none".  I think I removed it because I didn't think we needed it anymore.
[15:32:45] <jaubourg> yeah, having the div instead of a body when body exists should take care of Opera

[15:34:40] <jaubourg> damn, didn't see there was a blocker
[15:39:41] <timmywil> i don't know how to add a test case for this
[15:39:54] <timmywil> it fixes the fiddle tho
[15:40:19] <timmywil> and opera is fine
[15:41:54] <ricklamers> I think I might have found a bug
[15:41:58] <ricklamers> Anyone here?
[15:42:28] <jaubourg> timmywil: an independant page with an iframe putting us in the same situation and instructions on how to use it
[15:42:39] <jaubourg> I think I have some page like this for ajax stuff
[15:42:48] <timmywil> oh ok

[15:43:40] <jaubourg> something like this

[18:11:05] <electronplusplus> Hi
[18:11:12] <electronplusplus> just a quick question to the real experts
[18:11:19] <electronplusplus> I'm trying to make document as droppable, using $(document).droppable(); doesn't work
[18:11:39] <electronplusplus> I'm trying to drag and drop images between frames
[18:11:53] <ajpiano> electronplusplus: did you some how doubt that i was one of "the real experts"
[18:12:14] <electronplusplus> LOOL
[18:12:27] <electronplusplus> no ajpiano, I've not doubt
[18:12:55] <ajpiano> well, $(document).droppable() won't work
[18:13:36] <electronplusplus> it's possible to make an iframe droppable?
[18:14:53] <ajpiano> i don't think it will work in the way you expect, which is that you'll be able to move things from frame to frame
[18:15:08] <ajpiano> at least not without like, getting very very clever and hacky
[18:16:24] <electronplusplus> ajpiano: my idea is to do a callback when somethings drop on the frame
[18:16:56] <ajpiano> yeah, that's what i was ... getting at
[18:32:44] <electronplusplus> I couldn't make a frame droppable  :\
