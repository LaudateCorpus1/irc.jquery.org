[00:35:04] <bythenumbers> Hello, I am a 3rd year comp sci student and am looking to work on an opensource project. I was wondering how to get started?
[01:40:54] <Eviltwin> Is that open source project jQuery or not jQuery?

[22:01:48] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1015 - vote is -1 on this approach - I spelled out the approach I would take in case the guy wanted to try.  Also mikesherov - what do you think about the attack on that unit test.

[22:54:55] <gnarf> well rather toggle
[22:55:07] <gnarf> can't belive there wasn't a unit test on this
