[07:53:52] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: From m_gol, 2d 21h ago: I need feedback about an ancient bug from you; ping me when you have a moment
[07:54:03] <DaveMethvin> i'm around m_gol 
[08:00:09] <ben_alman> hey mikesherov i'm having some confusion with jscs
[08:00:37] <ben_alman> is that your thing? is there a channel for it?
[08:02:35] <mikesherov> hi ben_alman no channel currently
[08:02:38] <mikesherov> although there should be
[08:02:41] <ben_alman> ok
[08:02:52] <mikesherov> what's up?
[08:02:53] <ben_alman> i'm trying to do: "disallowMultipleVarDecl": "exceptUndefined"
[08:02:59] <mikesherov> ha
[08:03:02] <ben_alman> and am getting Warning: disallowMultipleVarDecl option requires true or "strict" value
[08:03:02] <mikesherov> the most confusing of rules
[08:03:10] <mikesherov> oh, just wait for 1.8
[08:03:13] <ben_alman> hrmn
[08:03:16] <mikesherov> it'll be out Friday
[08:03:23] <ben_alman> ok.
[08:03:29] <mikesherov> we're launching grunt preset that day to
[08:03:32] <mikesherov> too*
[08:03:51] <ben_alman> which is funny because the grunt style isn't deliberate
[08:04:08] <mikesherov> ya
[08:04:12] <ben_alman> i'm trying to make one right now, deliberately, for a new project
[08:04:26] <mikesherov> got it
[08:04:28] <ben_alman> ok well i'll put this on hold until next week
[08:04:29] <mikesherov> try master for now
[08:04:35] <ben_alman> i'm using the grunt plugin
[08:04:38] <ben_alman> so...
[08:04:39] <ben_alman> :P
[08:04:42] <mikesherov> Oh, ok
[08:04:47] <mikesherov> that makes sense
[08:05:30] <mikesherov> if you're using ST3, you can get the sublimeLinter plguin if you want to manually verify your config for now
[08:05:38] <mikesherov> ben_alman: ^
[08:05:48] <ben_alman> my personal rule for var declarations is "no assignments in a multi-var declaration" which seems to be what "exceptUndefined" does
[08:06:11] <mikesherov> ha, it might be! I lost track of that rule completely
[08:06:18] <ben_alman> yeah
[08:06:24] <ben_alman> no biggie, i have a super basic one for now
[08:06:53] <mikesherov> also, it might be easier to use a preset, and then nullify or modify the rules that are different
[08:07:04] <ben_alman> maybe
[08:07:12] <ben_alman> not sure i want to deal with the fallout when a preset changes
[08:07:21] <mikesherov> true
[08:07:30] <ben_alman> you should probably say you'll never, ever change them
[08:08:36] <mikesherov> we have rules about when and why we change things: https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs#versioning--semver
[08:09:26] <ben_alman> you might want to add presets to that list
[08:09:38] <mikesherov> true
[08:09:40] <ben_alman> (major release)
[08:09:49] <ben_alman> great work though. love the project.
[08:09:55] <mikesherov> thanks!
[08:11:32] <mikesherov> ben_alman: there's a #jscs room now. Ask future questions there or just ping me if you need anything else
[08:12:24] <ben_alman> thanks!

[16:38:27] <Krinkle> markelog_: ping
[16:39:37] <Krinkle> What's the status on using jscs or esformatter with regards to autocorrecting existing code (e.g. run a grunt task to fix up local changes that don't comply instead of doing it manually)
[16:40:29] <Krinkle> last I checked jzaefferer was in support of esformatter, and others were saying jscs is better but doesn't autoformat. jscs doesn't seem to have infrastructure in place to change code, but maybe it wants to?
[16:40:55] <Krinkle> basically I want to point at something when I say we shouldn't use jsbeautifier
