[16:29:20] <jbedard> DaveMethvin: do we want to move forward with https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues/200? Since I had a potential solution for that which we discussed yesterday (which probably needs a PR and more discussion still)...
[16:30:02] <DaveMethvin> jbedard: i was thinking there are cases like lazy loading where that might still catch problems
[16:30:30] <DaveMethvin> not really Migrate per se but kind of like the detection we do for quirks mode
[16:31:03] <jbedard> yeah it could, those would have been issues in v1/2 as well though right?
[16:31:11] <DaveMethvin> yep
[16:31:34] <DaveMethvin> more like a general debugging helper, i agree
[16:31:51] <jbedard> yeah it could be useful for that, thx for confirming
