[12:41:22] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[12:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:53:26] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: i added a web repo for us to track web stuff
[12:53:28] <danheberden> what do you think?
[12:53:44] <scott_gonzalez> What kind of web stuff?
[12:53:57] <danheberden> like anything that doesn't have its own repo
[12:54:01] <danheberden> like the issue i assigned to you :p
[12:54:21] <danheberden> or, like, overarching things like "add jqcon banner to websites"
[12:54:27] <danheberden> stuff that isn't foundation specific
[12:54:45] <danheberden> hence why i didn't just opt to use that repo (assuming more people would be on the 'web' repo than foundation members)
[12:54:49] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? I already removed the banner.
[12:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> How did it come back?
[12:54:57] <danheberden> seriously?
[12:54:59] <danheberden> that's weird
[12:55:06] <danheberden> cache problem maybe?
[12:55:12] <danheberden> weird, ya
[12:55:21] <danheberden> i just refreshed again and it went aaay
[12:55:22] <danheberden> *away
[12:55:32] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[12:55:35] <danheberden> one of the proxies is caching it
[12:55:44] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's going to be used very rarely.
[12:55:53] <danheberden> www3
[12:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> Every site will have it's own repo within a few weeks.
[12:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> And stuff like common headers will be handled in web-base-template.
[12:56:22] <danheberden> what about, like, "we need a website to do X"
[12:56:25] <danheberden> where do those requests go?
[12:56:32] <danheberden> i don't anticipate heavy useage
[12:56:47] <scott_gonzalez> A new site? Just create an empty repo...
[12:56:47] <danheberden> but i *would* like a sensible home for these disparate things
[12:56:56] <danheberden> no, i'm trying to not think of us here
[12:57:01] <danheberden> like - someone that isn't an admin
[12:57:09] <danheberden> but has a legitimate issue/need
[12:57:25] <danheberden> do you think, from that perspective, it still doesn't make sense
[12:57:26] <danheberden> ?
[12:57:28] <scott_gonzalez> I can't think of any legitimate issues/needs that aren't (or won't be) addressed by existing repos.
[12:58:21] <danheberden> and discussion re: a new website or service?
[12:58:39] <danheberden> should be in a new blank repo with its possible name?
[12:58:58] <danheberden> requiring its creating before its discussion?
[12:59:04] <scott_gonzalez> The discussion should just happen.
[12:59:07] <danheberden> lol
[12:59:14] <scott_gonzalez> I can't think of a case where we'd need an issue to discuss whether we need a site.
[12:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> IRC, email, weekly calls...there are plenty of places for a discussion.
[12:59:38] <danheberden> i'm worried we'll just keep on the way we do - only board members actually discussing/working at it
[12:59:43] <danheberden> ok
[12:59:47] <danheberden> i'll concede
[12:59:56] <scott_gonzalez> You think community members are going to tell us to build new sites?
[13:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> But only if we have a repo that nobody in the community even realizes exists?
[13:01:34] <danheberden> I think if we don't start creating areas for us to manage requests/issues/discussion besides organic IRC/Meetings/One-off meetings we'll continue to be the ones doing the work
[13:01:43] <danheberden> and not be as prepared to have help
[13:01:55] <danheberden> repo's gone - if we ever need it, we can make it
[13:02:00] <danheberden> and i appreciate your feedback
[13:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> But we have repos for EVERYTHING now (where now = within a month)
[13:02:12] <danheberden> then we're fine
[13:02:16] <danheberden> and there's no problem
[13:02:31] <danheberden> just trying to find a way to manage the thing i'm supposed to be managine
[13:02:33] <danheberden> *managing
[13:02:42] <danheberden> and i don't feel i have the tools to do that, so trying to fix that
[13:02:46] <danheberden> i'll figure it out
[13:03:25] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have an example of something that's not cleanly handled today?
[13:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> The jqueryui.com banner will be handled by jqueryui.com repo as soon as that's live.
[13:04:01] <scott_gonzalez> I can't imagine someone creating an issue to create a new site. That seems really odd to me.
[13:04:05] <danheberden> not specifically - just the issue of different communications that happen and dont have a sound place
[13:04:16] <danheberden> like you said, possible that the new repo's will fix this
[13:04:20] <danheberden> so there won't be a problem
[13:05:06] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[13:05:08] <danheberden> like i said, i just need to find a way to manage this - and a repo might now be the best way
[13:05:12] <danheberden> *might not be
[13:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> We've definitely had problems in the past with not having GitHub repos for everything.
[13:05:28] <danheberden> i wasn't being sarcastic when i said "thanks for your feedback"
[13:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> I think the important thing now will just be for us to be diligent about creating issues for things that aren't resolved immediately.
[13:07:29] <danheberden> i think i'll need to find a way to get some kind of bird's eye on this stuff, though - even if that be as simple as a google doc
[13:07:38] <danheberden> even if just, like, for my own sake
[13:07:44] <danheberden> so sounds like a personal problem! ha
[13:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> I've been thinking about creating a service that rolls up issues from many repos.
[13:09:16] <scott_gonzalez> Haven't put too much thought into it yet, but that might be good enough to solve your problem.
[13:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> I was thinking about it because I now have so many repos on GitHub that it's impossible for me to remember which ones have open issues.
[13:09:59] <scott_gonzalez> Which I assume is the exact problem you're trying to solve for yourself with jQuery repos.
[13:11:16] <danheberden> garann was working on something like that
[13:11:35] <danheberden> called haught
[13:11:57] <danheberden> wonder if she'd be interested in working on it more with jq peeps
[13:12:34] <danheberden> though, realistically, it'd be nice to just get through this launch of stuff
[13:12:37] <danheberden> and then see where we're att
[13:12:38] <danheberden> *at
[13:13:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, for now we should just focus on the launch.
[13:13:54] <scott_gonzalez> I did a test deploy of the plugin site (all manual) yesterday with gnarf.
[13:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> It went really well.
[13:14:07] <danheberden> wonderful!
[13:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> It was all of 5 commands from empty server to running site :-)
[13:15:02] <scott_gonzalez> So that should be easy to get into puppet...
[13:16:03] <danheberden> that's hot
[13:16:15] <danheberden> that smells of good success
[13:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[13:16:38] <danheberden> alright, almost out of power
[13:16:40] <danheberden> thanks for the feedback scott_gonzalez
[13:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> We'll see how it goes once it's up for real though.
[13:16:44] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[13:16:45] <danheberden> hearts and hugs and all that jazz
[13:17:00] <scott_gonzalez> later
