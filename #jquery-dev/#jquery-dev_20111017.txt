[08:49:24] <gnarf> kswedberg: i got addy to try to write it... :)

[10:13:04] <safzouf> Hi
[10:13:06] <safzouf> how to understand the closure ?
[10:13:09] <safzouf> (function($) {
[10:13:16] <safzouf> very confusing...
[10:14:22] <gnarf> safzouf: support in #jquery
[10:14:40] <safzouf> they didn't help ma :(
[10:17:21] <rwaldron> gnarf timmywil i figured it out
[10:17:28] <rwaldron> but.. it's a total effing bummer
[10:18:12] <rwaldron> i had an idea that possibly there was an issue with cached fragments
[10:18:40] <rwaldron> so i just added "section|article" to rnocache and boom, the test passes
[10:18:51] <rwaldron> obviously, that's not the "fix"
[10:19:34] <gnarf> hrm
[10:20:04] <rwaldron> basically, we need to treat "abbr|article|aside|audio|canvas|datalist|details|figcaption|figure|footer|header|hgroup|mark|meter|nav|output|progress|section|summary|time|video"
[10:20:18] <rwaldron> the same way as object and embed is treated in IE6
[10:20:21] <rwaldron> but in IE6,7,8
[10:20:44] <gnarf> new support test?
[10:21:18] <rwaldron> or just use one of the existing, that will infer IE6,7,8
[10:21:32] <rwaldron> and drop that string into something like...
[10:22:17] <rwaldron> ryunohazfragments = /<(?:abbr|article|aside|audio|canvas|datalist|details|figcaption|figure|footer|header|hgroup|mark|meter|nav|output|progress|section|summary|time|video)/i
[10:47:08] <rwaldron> gnarf timmywil review? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/550/
[10:47:09] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (2m, 12s ago): IE6,7,8 cannot cache fragments of unknown elems. Fixes #10501
[10:47:12] <rwaldron> going to lunch
[10:47:15] <rwaldron> bbiaf
[11:23:25] <rwaldron> jaubourg updated
[11:23:40] <rwaldron> but I realized that we refer to args[0] like crazy
[11:32:47] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[11:32:56] <timmywil> rwaldron: yea
[11:33:12] <rwaldron> i was thinking the same, about reusing the nodeName list
[11:33:30] <rwaldron> would require a new RegExp
[11:33:37] <rwaldron> are you into that?
[11:34:08] <timmywil> fine with me
[11:34:26] <timmywil> is that against our style guide?
[11:34:58] <timmywil> nah, we're good
[11:36:14] <rwaldron> word
[11:37:08] <jaubourg> \o/
[11:46:42] <rwaldron> timmywil whatchoo think? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/550/files
[11:46:43] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (1h, 1m ago): IE6,7,8 cannot cache fragments of unknown elems. Fixes #10501
[11:51:28] <timmywil> rwaldron: nice
[11:51:38] <rwaldron> glad you like it
[11:51:44] <timmywil> was passing nodeNames just to satisfy lint?
[11:51:52] <rwaldron> naw
[11:52:09] <rwaldron> real browsers actually said "nodeNames is undefined"
[11:52:57] <timmywil> orly?
[11:53:09] <rwaldron> waaaaaiiiit
[11:53:12] <rwaldron> one sec
[11:53:20] <rwaldron> i had 2 things going on at the same time
[11:53:23] <jaubourg> splitting at each exec? really? :P
[11:53:40] <rwaldron> i might've conflated them
[11:53:46] <timmywil> jaubourg: sort of
[11:53:53] <jaubourg> or is it called only once?
[11:53:57] <timmywil> ^^
[11:54:00] <jaubourg> <= eternal newb
[11:54:13] <rwaldron> WOO
[11:54:22] <rwaldron> timmywil glad you made me re-look at that
[11:54:33] <rwaldron> i def crossed the streams on that one
[11:54:47] <timmywil> love ghostbusters references
[11:55:12] <rwaldron> Ghostbusters is my all time favorite movie
[11:55:25] <rwaldron> a-ha!
[11:55:30] <rwaldron> lint is cool with this as well
[11:55:39] <timmywil> O.o
[11:55:43] <rwaldron> maybe we override that complaint
[11:56:37] <rwaldron> timmywil puuushed
[11:57:07] <timmywil> cool :)

[15:42:24] <mikesherov> http://jqbug.com/10254 is a dupe of http://jqbug.com/8388
[15:43:32] <gnarf> hrm
[15:47:10] <mikesherov> fix is simple too
[15:47:14] <mikesherov> submitting a PR for it now
[15:47:49] <gnarf> mikesherov: can you write a test that will pass after the patch and fail before too?
[15:48:25] <mikesherov> yeah, of course
[15:48:30] <mikesherov> that's a requirement ;-)
[15:48:43] <gnarf> kickass
[15:51:07] <gnarf> hrm

[15:51:37] <gnarf> yup
[15:51:40] <rwaldron> nice
[15:51:45] <kswedberg> rwaldron: that's what I was thinking. :)
[15:52:38] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/c8cfdd3c93abef4e02fa --- uglify runs 4 minutes faster, and seems smaller for UI :)

[15:58:37] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (13.04s ago): fallback to elem.style for disconnected nodes, fixes #10254 and #8388
[15:58:52] <mikesherov> my CSS PR's are piling up...
[16:00:09] <mikesherov> gnarf, that's the PR, it's basically falling back to elem.style if elem.currentStyle sucks...
[16:00:16] <mikesherov> i.e. a disconnected node in IE<9
[16:07:35] <rwaldron> mikesherov nix this: http://jsfiddle.net/img/logo.png
[16:07:47] <mikesherov> ok, no problem
[16:07:51] <mikesherov> copypasta
[16:08:17] <rwaldron> was there a newline at the end of the file?
[16:08:53] <mikesherov> Um
[16:08:58] <mikesherov> probably not
[16:10:22] <mikesherov> not really sure how to get rid of it...
[16:11:57] <mikesherov> rwaldron, PR updated
[16:12:31] <mikesherov> I stopped DDOS'ing jsfiddle
[16:13:33] <mikesherov> ok, gotta run
