[01:46:07] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Migrate build #468: STILL FAILING in 10 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Migrate/468/
[09:49:56] <mknaw> Hi. Want to ask about opinions about adding a starts with / ends with selector that would work against all classes for an element with multiple classes (e.g. "ba" matches element with class "foo bar"). Could be useful in some cases, although I understand that there are workarounds. Would this be better suited for a plugin? Would it be appropriate
[09:49:56] <mknaw> to open an issue on GitHub?
