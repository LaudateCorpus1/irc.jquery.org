[05:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: There is a distinct lack of squirrely brackets in
[06:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> our code
[06:43:00] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: to balance that out, there is a surplus of squirrely code within our brackets
[06:43:08] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[08:19:20] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L58 where is jQuery.text defined?
[08:24:09] <danzik17> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/sizzle-jquery.js https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/sizzle.js#L289-320
[08:24:57] <gnarf> thanks danzik17 - i had just grepped my way there finally :)
[08:52:25] <sizcommit> [sizzle] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/9eblvw
[08:52:25] <sizcommit> [sizzle/master] Adjust default selector engine list - Timmy Willison
[09:03:01] <mikesherov> meeting time!
[09:06:45] <gnarf> rwaldron: do you know if ES.next is going to support lookbehind?
[09:09:33] <rwaldron> gnarf looks like yes
[09:09:43] <rwaldron> there is a proposal that has reached harmony status
[09:09:44] <rwaldron> http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php?id=harmony:regexp_look-behind_support
[10:05:16] <gnarf> rwaldron: thanks for being my inside man - that news is awesome
[10:06:37] <rwaldron> hahah you're quite welcome
[10:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I'm not sure why I thought of this, but last night I remembered that I added the guaranteedUnique check for a methods.
[10:11:10] <timmywil> gibson042: just to clarify, when you say can't work on individual elements, you don't mean Sizzle( ":first", document, null, [ elem ]) is broken right?
[10:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> You can probably remove that in 2.0.
[10:11:29] <scott_gonzalez> It was a perf optimization for IE.
[10:11:34] <gibson042> timmywil: correct
[10:11:49] <gibson042> I mean that the matcher functions cannot work with an (elem, ...) signature
[10:12:10] <gibson042> not Sizzle itself, but the return value from filter[type]
[10:12:47] <timmywil> oh of course
[10:13:03] <timmywil> it didn't do that before
[10:13:16] <timmywil> had to finish the selection before running set pseudos
[10:14:08] <timmywil> but you're saying there are now two kinds of matchers from compile
[10:14:14] <gibson042> yeah
[10:14:17] <timmywil> gotcha
[10:14:18] <gibson042> poorly, apparently ;)
[10:14:31] <gibson042> English speak hard
[10:14:37] <timmywil> nah, I'm just trying to understand everything
[10:15:26] <timmywil> your english speak bueno fine
[10:17:09] <gibson042> element matchers are the ones you're already familiar with, setMatchers (indicated by passing through markFunction) accept two arrays and move matches from the first to the second if the first exists, otherwise search for matches under context and just push to the second array
[10:18:58] <timmywil> gibson042: have you had a chance to look at the new perf suite?
[10:19:55] <gibson042> not yet, but it should be obvious if I open up seed/index.html, right?
[10:20:34] <gibson042> *speed, rather
[10:21:07] <timmywil> yup, it doesn't need php, but due to iframe communication, it needs a local server
[10:21:14] <timmywil> so just not file:
[10:21:17] <gibson042> ok
[10:21:23] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin can you use waldron.rick@gmail instead?
[10:21:34] <DaveMethvin> i'll add it
[10:21:36] <rwaldron> I use rick@bocoup exclusively for bocoup stuff
[10:21:47] <rwaldron> thanks!
[10:22:25] <DaveMethvin> pesky address lists
[10:25:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What's the URL for the plugins site web hook?
[10:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> plugsin.jquery.com:3000?
[10:25:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: um
[10:25:51] <scott_gonzalez> plugsin.jquery.com:8001?
[10:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> It's something :-P
[10:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> *plugins
[10:26:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i don't have it staged yet
[10:26:52] <gnarf> download has 3000, amd-builder has 3100
[10:26:54] <scott_gonzalez> I thought you ddi.
[10:27:07] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't we test it a long time ago?
[10:27:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it's cloned - and we tested, but i was missing some scripts to get it running via services/etc
[10:28:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:28:29] <gnarf> i'll get it running here in a few
[10:28:37] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, I was apparently using http://jq02.stage.jquery.com:8001/
[10:29:20] <gnarf> looks like default is 8001
[10:29:26] <gnarf> which works
[10:29:36] <gnarf> what do i need to run after a pull btw?
[10:29:36] <scott_gonzalez> ok, so it'll be plugins.jquery.com:8001?
[10:29:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no, jq02 will prolly be the host
[10:30:05] <gnarf> plugins is on a different machine
[10:30:07] <gnarf> the wp-host
[10:30:16] <gnarf> i was thinking we could proxy it
[10:30:31] <gnarf> from plugins.jquery.com/hook
[10:30:32] <gnarf> or something
[10:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> I don't want to take a top-level path.
[10:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> We can, we just need to blacklist it as a plugin name though.
[10:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> We're already blacklisting stuff that comes from WordPress.
[11:05:37] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: preferred shortname for jquery ui?
[11:05:41] <paul_irish> is jquery-ui or jqueryui
[11:08:41] <scott_gonzalez> I guess jquery-ui
[11:08:56] <scott_gonzalez> That's what we use on Google Code.
[11:12:33] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: k
[11:12:49] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: i made a package for jquery ui for bower
[11:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's funny that they use us in the example.
[12:24:35] <rwaldron> sindresorhus yt?
[12:25:32] <rwaldron> paul_irish addyosmani?
[12:25:40] <rwaldron> just a quick q when any has a sec
[12:25:40] <addyosmani> heya rwaldron
[12:25:44] <rwaldron> oh hai!
[12:25:49] <addyosmani> hai hai!
[12:26:04] <rwaldron> addyosmani is there a specific version of grunt that yeoman expects?
[12:26:09] <rwaldron> I'm trying to run tests
[12:26:29] <addyosmani> ben feels its scary but we're using a specific SHA of 0.4
[12:26:31] <rwaldron> (from repo, not a project generated with yeoman)
[12:26:38] <rwaldron> i see
[12:26:40] <rwaldron> hm.
[12:27:00] <rwaldron> that explains why my attempts to update my global grunt were fruitless
[12:27:13] <rwaldron> oh my, nevermind
[12:27:20] <rwaldron> there arent tests for server.js
[12:27:43] <addyosmani> https://nodeload.github.com/cowboy/grunt/tarball/0ba6d4b529
[12:28:30] <rwaldron> yeah, i tried
[12:28:31] <addyosmani> We still have quite some way to go with retroactively adding tests for features that were landed earlier which had none.
[12:28:32] <rwaldron> no worries
[12:28:35] <addyosmani> cool cool
[12:28:41] <rwaldron> that's what I figured
[12:28:47] <rwaldron> sometimes the innovation happens fast
[12:29:05] <addyosmani> yep. We do want tests though. Its scary without them.
[12:29:20] <addyosmani> (and plz feel free to join us in #yeoman anytime you have q's in case one of us isnt around)
[12:29:21] <addyosmani> :)
[13:09:17] <jzaefferer> hey DaveMethvin - any updates from Chad on the closure compiler front?
[13:12:55] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: nope, he just had a baby back in July so he may be kind of busy
[13:18:11] <jzaefferer> okay
[13:29:44] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez (and anyone else)  ready to publish this I think: http://blog.jquery.com/?p=2220&preview=true&preview_id=2220&public=1&nonce=1137d690c6
[13:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: "They also ensure that when you contribute, youâ€™ll some recognition..."
[13:32:14] <scott_gonzalez> missing a word
[13:32:43] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Did you not want to get a sentence or two from FSF?
[13:32:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah  i was gonna ask about that
[13:37:31] <scott_gonzalez> If you send Josh a copy of the draft, I'm sure he can give you a quote.
[13:38:48] <DaveMethvin> k sounds good scott_gonzalez
[14:31:15] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You forgot to actually include the draft in that email...
[14:31:28] <DaveMethvin> haha, ok
[16:34:13] <mikesherov> .
[17:06:44] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: did you read this? http://net.tutsplus.com/articles/editorials/jquery-in-2013-or-how-to-properly-drop-ie/
[17:07:43] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: didn't see it but from a skim it seems he likes it!
[17:09:19] <kswedberg> yeah, except it gets muddled with the 1.9 stuff. I don't know if it's the writer's fault or the commenters' fault, but nobody seems to get that you can use 1.9 for oldIE and 2.0 for others
[17:09:30] <kswedberg> like, on the same page!!!1
[17:10:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah, imma need to be really clear on that when 1.9 comes out
[18:16:22] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yt?
[18:16:30] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: ya
[18:16:36] <mikesherov> I had a question about traversing
[18:16:50] <mikesherov> trying to expand my reach a bit :-)
[18:17:06] <mikesherov> got a sec for me?
[18:17:11] <DaveMethvin> oh sure, fire a way
[18:17:13] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12009
[18:18:00] <DaveMethvin> oh THAT one
[18:18:09] <DaveMethvin> there's a related ticket, lemme find it
[18:18:23] <mikesherov> so, I have a patch that fixes it
[18:18:28] <mikesherov> I wanna know if I did it right...
[18:18:35] <mikesherov> http://pastebin.com/Uw1teg96
[18:18:38] <DaveMethvin> did  you change a jQuery.merge?
[18:18:42] <mikesherov> no
[18:19:03] <mikesherov> lemme show you a compare actually
[18:19:08] <mikesherov> I know I did it wrong
[18:19:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah a diff would help
[18:20:16] <mikesherov> https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/compare/t12009
[18:20:52] <mikesherov> so, I'm fairly certain I could've done something else, but wasn't sure what to do other than that
[18:21:58] <DaveMethvin> i have to go back and check but i thought at least one of these was due to a jQuery.merge being misused
[18:22:05] <DaveMethvin> just a sec
[18:29:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think i was confused by another broken thing
[18:29:56] <DaveMethvin> i see the stacking issue
[18:30:33] <DaveMethvin> i guess you're doing the pushstack first since it's needed below anyway
[18:31:37] <DaveMethvin> why aren't we using $.unique there i wonder
[18:31:45] <mikesherov> sure, but I was thinking more along the lines of, I switched to an each
[18:31:48] <mikesherov> with a push
[18:31:56] <mikesherov> couldn't get the filter to do the right thing
[18:32:20] <DaveMethvin> that's what i was trying to trace
[18:32:36] <DaveMethvin> but the main problem is that before your change, there was no pushstack
[18:33:09] <DaveMethvin> i can't believe we never had a test for that
[18:33:42] <DaveMethvin> the filter should work, but you'd need to pushstack the filtered result, right?
[18:34:00] <mikesherov> right
[18:34:26] <mikesherov> let me try that and see if it works
[18:35:17] <mikesherov> yeah, a lot surprises me about test coverage
[18:35:27] <mikesherov> replaceWith is hopelessly undertested too
[18:35:48] <DaveMethvin> that explains why it's hopelessly overbroken
[18:35:58] <mikesherov> yes
[18:36:17] <mikesherov> So, does my approach seem reasonable?
[18:36:32] <mikesherov> is there something else I should've been doing?
[18:37:02] <DaveMethvin> most of the others pushstack with the set they want as the first arg i think
[18:37:25] <DaveMethvin> not that it's wrong, just kind of strange
[18:37:35] <DaveMethvin> it was already doing that,
[18:37:40] <mikesherov> I'll try that
[18:37:41] <DaveMethvin> so it's not something you introduced
[18:37:44] <mikesherov> gimme a minute
[18:40:20] <DaveMethvin> huh
[18:44:21] <mikesherov> updated the compare: https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery/compare/t12009?w=1
[18:45:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah fits the pattern better
[18:46:26] <DaveMethvin> how do you feel about caching the length? Seems unneeded to me
[18:46:41] <DaveMethvin> Chrome actually gets no benefit at all from it
[18:47:15] <mikesherov> I can also initialize i up higher
[18:47:25] <mikesherov> I was just wondering about the pattern in general
[18:47:35] <mikesherov> and actually, this way is smaller
[18:47:38] <mikesherov> one sec
[18:47:39] <DaveMethvin> i like the pattern of doing the pushstack last
[18:54:27] <mikesherov> cool, and I found 16 bytes in the process
[18:55:07] <mikesherov> thanks for the feedback
[18:55:29] <DaveMethvin> wow 16 bytes!
[18:55:56] <DaveMethvin> i'm looking at the ticket that just came in, it's a dup
[19:03:56] <mikesherov> which one?
[19:04:00] <mikesherov> the css anim one?
[19:08:39] <DaveMethvin> the one i closed as a dup :D
[19:09:54] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/927/
[19:09:55] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (17.211s ago): fixes #12009, jQueryObject.find(element) corrupts the stack
[19:09:59] <mikesherov> thanks for the help, Dave
[19:14:32] <mikesherov> I'm sure you're happy to have 19 pulls to review
[19:15:50] <mikesherov> this one should be easy as well: I'm taking it! http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10470
[19:26:49] <gnarf> mikesherov: +3 comments ;)
[19:26:58] <mikesherov> ?
[19:27:48] <gnarf> PR 927
[19:28:03] <mikesherov> I see
[19:29:58] <gnarf> just feels like a good opportunity to up the readability there :)
[19:32:47] <gnarf> there seem to be two sets of loop vars? *shrug*
[19:33:48] <gnarf> the one you commented back mikesherov was pointing out the spacing? might as well fix it
[19:34:04] <mikesherov> no, not about spacing
[19:34:08] <mikesherov> about n--
[19:34:23] <mikesherov> I didn't realize it was spacing
[19:34:25] <mikesherov> fixing now
[19:52:25] <danzik17> DaveMethvin: quick question on the CLA email that just went out - i'm assuming that even though a mailing address is required, it's not being published anywhere or publicly available, right?
[19:52:41] <DaveMethvin> Right, it's not for the public
[19:52:52] <DaveMethvin> only the name and email are public, per AUTHORS.txt danzik17
[19:53:07] <danzik17> cool, thanks - that's what i figured, but wanted to confirm before i filled it out
[19:53:27] <DaveMethvin> i think it's just to prove you really exist on the planet :)
[22:18:32] <johnbender> ?tell ryanneufeld you might want to try switching the shared folder over to nfs
[22:18:33] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[22:19:26] <johnbender> ?tell ryanneufeld the file structure wasn't too deep so I figured I would use the virtualbox shared folders, but they suck performance wise and they've been known to cause other issues
[22:19:27] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[22:20:06] <johnbender> ?tell ryanneufeld just have to keep that in mind if we get folks who use windows and want to work on infra (though the shared folders work really well on windows)
[22:20:13] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
