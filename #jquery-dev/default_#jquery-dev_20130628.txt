[08:54:42] <nacin> looks like the IRC logs (ZNC server?) are missing some/all of the meeting earlier this week. Just checking if "Monday/Tuesday for both?" (per agenda, re: 1.10.2/2.0.3) stands?
[10:03:16] <kborchers> danheberden: meeting?
[10:37:41] <gvilla23> Who can I speak to about hosting a company sponsored Meet-Up, like a http://meetup.com/, type of meeting?

[10:40:41] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, sorry
[10:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need to talk to anyone.
[10:41:06] <scott_gonzalez> Just organize the meetup.

[10:43:51] <scott_gonzalez> meetup.com has a lot of information for organizers.
