[09:16:57] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: where can I find the log in information for the jquery browserstack account?
[09:17:17] <DaveMethvin> everybody has a different account mikesherov 
[09:17:23] <mikesherov> ohhh
[09:17:34] <mikesherov> how do I get one under the org?
[09:17:39] <DaveMethvin> i think i have admin for it, but it's been ages
[09:17:43] <DaveMethvin> let me check
[09:18:10] <mikesherov> thanks DaveMethvin 
[09:20:10] <DaveMethvin> looks like scott_gonzalez has admin on the browserstack acct, he should be able to add you
[09:21:06] <mikesherov> kk, thanks DaveMethvin 
[09:21:26] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: Scott is marked as owner, the rest as users. BrowserStack also has admins, it seems at least you should be an admin
[09:22:34] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: i don't see a way to add users 
[09:23:00] <DaveMethvin> or to remove them for that matter
[09:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Check your inbox for an invite.
[09:24:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: because you're just a user; I'm saying that you should be given admin rights
[09:24:28] <DaveMethvin> oh, good idea
[09:24:34] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: give me admin rights :)
[09:25:09] <scott_gonzalez> I can't
[09:25:16] <scott_gonzalez> There's only one admin.
[09:25:22] <DaveMethvin> oh the owner?
[09:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, wait, maybe I can.
[09:25:47] <DaveMethvin> funny that it lets users on an acct see the whole list tho
[09:26:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, you're an admin.
[09:26:12] <mikesherov> thanks scott_gonzalez 
[09:26:23] <m_gol> there can only be one owner but many admins
[09:26:30] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[10:48:22] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: can you make me an admin, too?
[10:49:10] <jzaefferer> mikesherov m_gol DaveMethvin: I've been creating accounts for individual projects, using email addresses like browserstack+globalize@jquery.com browserstack+qunit@jquery.com and browserstack+sizzle@jquery.com
[10:49:27] <jzaefferer> that last one might be in use in Sizzle, not sure
[10:49:34] <mikesherov> i see
[10:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: done
[10:49:49] <jzaefferer> I can share the credentials for that google account if anyone needs it
[10:50:31] <jzaefferer> Nice, now I can invite users myself :-)
[10:50:35] <jzaefferer> FREEEEEEDOM
[11:49:03] <Krinkle> Why does parseHTML return null instead of empty array when given an empty string?
[11:49:24] <Krinkle> If given invalid parameters, it might make sense. But empty string is still a string.
[11:49:36] <Krinkle> (or array with text node)
[11:49:54] <arthurvr> you rease quite a good point there
[11:50:27] <Krinkle> It caused an error in Wikimedia code. Curious if this is something we'd be willing to change.
[11:50:48] <Krinkle> "we wrote code assuming that $.parseHTML() always returns something that you can check .length on"
[11:50:54] <Krinkle> "Returns: Array"
[11:52:30] <arthurvr> from the source: ‚Äùif ( !data || typeof data !== "string" ) { return null;‚Äù
[11:52:52] <Krinkle> Yeah
[11:52:55] <arthurvr> why the ‚Äùif( !data )‚Äù?
[11:53:02] <Krinkle> Presumably for non-string input
[11:53:08] <Krinkle> wait
[11:53:10] <Krinkle> right
[11:53:12] <Krinkle> it already checks tyoe
[11:53:13] <Krinkle> type
[11:53:17] <Krinkle> It's been there since the first version
[11:53:17] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/e2497c682f26b7916d76cb2896c6fe621b376d82
[11:53:18] <arthurvr> yes it does
[11:53:18] <Krinkle> timmywil: 
[11:53:30] <Krinkle> equal( jQuery.parseHTML( "" ), null, "Nothing in, null out." );
[11:53:31] <Krinkle> :D
[11:54:17] <arthurvr> Who might know why this was included?
[11:54:29] <arthurvr> (sorry if I‚Äôm asking stupid questions, I‚Äôm quite new)
[11:57:25] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15Krinkle opened issue #1997: $.parseHTML( "" ) should not return null 02http://git.io/WelRcA
[11:58:37] <timmywil> It could be argued that empty string should create an empty text node, but parseHTML() has historically been used internally to create elements passed to jQuery(). jQuery("") === jQuery() <-- this can't change.
[11:59:23] <timmywil> more accurately, jQuery("").length === jQuery().length
[12:00:29] <arthurvr> the workaround for that would be quite easy right?
[12:01:09] <timmywil> it could be. Let me see what the browser does.
[12:02:03] <timmywil> createHTMLDocument also ignores empty string.
[12:02:24] <arthurvr> (we might say this is a documentation bug then)
[12:02:53] <timmywil> I'd agree with that
[12:04:03] <timmywil> hmm
[12:04:13] <timmywil> returning an empty array might be ok
[12:04:30] <arthurvr> yeah - that might be a fix
[12:04:36] <timmywil> I was thinking the solution was an empty text node.
[12:04:42] <timmywil> but an empty array might work fine
[12:04:43] <arthurvr> and is IMHO more consistent with the browser
[12:04:50] <timmywil> yea
[12:06:27] <Krinkle> timmywil: empty array instead array with text node is fine by me to
[12:06:31] <timmywil> I commented to that effect
[12:06:35] <Krinkle> timmywil: but ideally not null
[12:06:38] <Krinkle> too*
[12:06:54] <timmywil> we'll let the rest of the team review before making the change
[12:06:58] <Krinkle> Cool
[12:07:04] <Krinkle> timmywil: I'll submit a PR
[12:07:11] <timmywil> nice, thanks!
[12:07:26] <Krinkle> as exercise, since I haven't done that in a while
[12:13:32] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15Krinkle opened pull request #1998: core: Return empty array instead of null for parseHTML("") (06master...06issue/1997) 02http://git.io/CZxnWw
[12:13:42] <arthurvr> thanks Krinkle!
[12:15:09] <arthurvr> Krinkle: seems like the test has wrong description
[12:15:16] <Krinkle> arthurvr: already fixed
[12:15:30] <arthurvr> That was quick :-)
[12:15:48] <Krinkle> timmywil: fyi, I've considered what passing truethy values like non-zero numbers and boolean true would do. Typically I'd expect them to be casted to a string. But due to the existing typeof, those are already discarded so at least I'm not changing that behaviour
[12:16:30] <timmywil> sounds good
[12:16:54] <arthurvr> +1. I mean, why not?
[12:17:13] <timmywil> I mean, let's not change behavior there.
