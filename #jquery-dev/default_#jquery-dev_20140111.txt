[02:39:52] <OODavo> Should there be a forEach() method available on jQuery objects that uses the same API as Array::forEach()? I was surprised by the way the existing $('thing').each() method uses an interface inconsistent with Array::forEach(), in particular that it expects a callback in the form function(index, value) as opposed to forEach()'s function(value, index, wholeCollection). Including a forEach() might be good for consistencyâ€¦
[02:39:58] <OODavo> â€¦with core JavaScript, as well as general convenience (values are more useful than their indices a *lot* of the time).
[02:42:08] <greg5green> Nobody asked me, but I agree that this would be useful
[02:42:23] <greg5green> and consistent
[02:48:55] <OODavo> The main problem with such an addition is probably the potential for confusion between .each() and .forEach(); the gain in consistency with core might make up for that, though.

[03:24:19] <s3d_matt> I'm using the query validation engine, which is working 100%, and have created a ajax rule.  Currently this is in the query.validationengine-en.js file, but ideally I would like to add this rule in <Script> tags - but how do I append a rule?
