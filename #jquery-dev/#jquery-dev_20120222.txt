[04:39:33] <jzaefferer> clarkbox scott_gonzalez: any idea what this error could mean? "null has invalid __iterator__ value null" - makes the Firefox 3.6 tests fail
[04:40:48] <jzaefferer> that and no IE6 coming in
[04:49:21] <jq-jenkins> Project QUnit build #75: STILL FAILING in 1 min 56 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/75/
[04:49:37] <jzaefferer>  workers to start: [{"name":"firefox","version":"3.6"},{"name":"ie","version":"8.0"},{"name":"ie","version":"9.0"},{"name":"opera","version":"11.1"},{"name":"opera","version":"11.5"},{"name":"firefox","version":"10.0"}]
[04:49:59] <jzaefferer> that looks wrong: no Chrome, no IE6 or 7
[04:50:04] <jzaefferer> no Safari
[04:50:16] <jzaefferer> while getneeded reported this: [1,3,8,9,10,11,13,14,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35]
[04:51:43] <jzaefferer> well, Chrome and Safari were not started as well
[04:51:59] <jzaefferer> still no sign of IE6/7
[05:04:12] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Which tests are causing that?
[05:04:46] <jzaefferer> QUnit's testsuite
[05:04:57] <jzaefferer> see jq-jenkins output
[05:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell DaveMethvin timmywil gnarf wycats paul_irish: Do we have anyone providing feedback for http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2012JanMar/0804.html
[05:24:45] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[05:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Bryan is out of the office for a week. Can you make sure jQuery UI 1.8.18 ends up on the CDN?
[05:30:34] <nFFF> What do donations towards jQuery go towards
[06:56:13] <scott_gonzalez> nFFF: conferences, team meetings, development, domain registrations, testing devices (think of the Filament phone lab), etc.
[07:16:35] <nFFF> scott_gonzalez, does anyone get paid?
[07:16:48] <nFFF> And how much do you guys raise in an avg yr?
[07:21:34] <rworth> nFFF: There are a few developers that have part-time contracts (myself and scott_gonzalez included), so they can dedicate more time than their employer or free-time would normally allow
[07:22:17] <rworth> Last year we raised around 500k if you include all donations and conference ticket sales, swag sales, conference sponsorships, and sponsorship of dedicated development efforts, such as jQuery Mobile and jQuery UI Grid
[07:24:22] <rworth> this year we hope to raise more. I announced a goal at the Oct conference of 750k for this year
[07:25:24] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8130 :-P
[07:46:32] <nFFF> rworth, basically are you guys getting to ball out of control on these donations :D
[07:49:58] <rworth> nFFF: "getting to ball out of control" is not a familiar expression to me. Can you rephrase that, if it is indeed a question?
[07:53:03] <nFFF> Im guessing you don't then :>
[07:53:11] <nFFF> Like private flights, nice hotels, bottles at da club
[07:53:33] <timmywil> only on the weekends
[07:53:52] <nFFF> aka kim dotcom :DD
[07:57:12] <rworth> thanks for the clarification. No, we take the trust of our community quite seriously. A majority vote of the jQuery Board is required to allocate resources and all voting is done in public (for transparency)
[07:59:39] <rworth> nFFF: also, we are organized as a non-profit, meaning we make decisions that are right for the project and the community not for a profit motive
[08:02:25] <nFFF> :>>
[08:04:56] <nFFF> rworth any logs of the past votes? :>
[08:05:03] <nFFF> just out of curiosity
[08:05:14] <rworth> all of them http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-board-public
[08:59:34] <nFFF> rworth
[08:59:36] <nFFF> whats swag?
[08:59:37] <nFFF> http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-board-public/browse_thread/thread/f36b11904cf3154e#
[09:00:11] <rworth> promotional items : t-shirts, mugs, bags, stickers, buttons, etc.
[09:01:08] <rworth> see also http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Promotional_merchandise
[09:01:31] <ajpiano> nFFF: swag is an initialism for "Stuff We All Get"
[09:08:40] <nFFF> I thought it was nice watches, and champagne
[09:08:51] <nFFF> I know whats going on in herre :F
[09:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> nFFF: Don't be silly, the champagne comes free with the private jets.
[09:57:00] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Is now good for a 15 min call?
[09:57:37] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez one sec and yes
[09:59:15] <jzaefferer> danheberden scott_gonzalez: is it about Scott's adoption? otherwise I'd join as well
[09:59:59] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: It depends how many run&coke™s we have
[10:00:11] <danheberden> jzaefferer i think scott_gonzalez just had some questions about infra?
[10:00:19] <danheberden> but yeah, come on in!
[10:00:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, jzaefferer may want to join
[15:25:09] <kanzie> Hi guys! I think I have found a problem with jQuery ajax() >1.4.4. I have isolated the problem to a fiddle here http://jsfiddle.net/TjPjF/
[15:26:07] <kanzie> If you run that fiddle with 1.7.1 using Webkit and track memory usage you will see that the test loads 3MB of XML, but it has Chrome consume and retain about 60MB which is not released by the garbage collector (running at 4min intervals).
[15:26:14] <kanzie> Only way to release it is closing the tab
[15:26:28] <kanzie> If you instead switch to jQuery 1.4.4, the memory is not consumed at all.
[15:26:37] <aaronmcadam> How does Gecko fare
[15:26:54] <kanzie> It could be the use of $.parseXML() in >1.4.4 for XML-data (which Im loading) that is leaking.
[15:27:08] <kanzie> I have not tried in Gecko as my single-page app rely on webkit only
[15:27:22] <aaronmcadam> Might be a webkit issue?
[15:27:41] <aaronmcadam> that's not good :p
[15:27:57] <kanzie> It could very well be. My tests in FF shows a memory building too, however John-David Dalton did not experience the leak in FF
[15:28:08] <aaronmcadam> I don't like this precedent being set, gonna end up back in the bad old days
[15:28:43] <kanzie> aaronmcadam: yeah, well we try not to use any tech that is incompatible with other browsers but have to target one renderer primarily.
[15:28:52] <aaronmcadam> why?
[15:29:37] <aaronmcadam> that's crazy
[15:29:53] <kanzie> Because its a contained system and we don't ship using different browsers but that's a bit beside the point. Please check the fiddle and see if I have found a valid bug that I should report or not. And also what I can do meanwhile to resolve this problem
[15:37:39] <aaronmcadam> bugger all by the looks of things
[15:37:49] <aaronmcadam> could well be webkit, file a bug there too who knows
[15:38:02] <aaronmcadam> hopefully one of the lads here will answer ye
[15:38:41] <aaronmcadam> in the meantime, file the bug
[15:38:49] <aaronmcadam> create an issue on github
[15:38:54] <aaronmcadam> tweet the project
