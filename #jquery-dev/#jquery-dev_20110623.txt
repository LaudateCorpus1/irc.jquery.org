[04:10:00] <gnarf> anyone around to talk about http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8627 ?
[04:23:43] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/420
[04:23:49] <gnarf> random idea
[07:59:32] <timmywil> .
[08:43:30] <jdsharp> Is there any documentation on the formatters for the jQuery UI grid?
[08:44:03] <rwaldron> ajpiano ^^ ?
[08:44:03] <jdsharp> I see them listed at http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/35172087/Grid-Features but I haven't found any additional details about it listed elsewhere
[08:45:41] <rwaldron> jdsharp I just asked richard worth (he's here IRL) and he said to tell you to add a comment to that page
[08:45:45] <rwaldron> (the one you linked)
[08:45:50] <rwaldron> hope that helps?
[08:47:06] <jdsharp> woah? IRL? Sweet!
[08:47:20] <rwaldron> yeah, he works at bocoup now
[08:47:31] <rwaldron> he's here doing a training
[08:47:51] <jdsharp> like IRL as in Ireland?
[08:48:19] <jdsharp> doh
[08:48:39] <jdsharp> Please excuse me, I am in need of more Coffee...
[08:48:57] <rwaldron> in real life
[08:48:58] <rwaldron> hahaha
[08:50:10] <jdsharp> For what it's Worth, my interpretation was much more exciting (my jokes are as bad as Doug Neiner's today)
[08:51:03] <rwaldron> a trip to ireland would be far more exciting
[08:58:13] <ajpiano> danheberden gnarf jzaefferer we're gonna have a plugins meeting in like 2 minutes
[08:58:36] <gnarf> ajpiano: skype?
[08:58:46] <ajpiano> yeah
[08:58:46] * danheberden plays "call me" on grooveshark
[08:58:54] <ajpiano> will do
[08:59:03] <gnarf> k, quick AFK, i wonder if i can set skype to auto answer
[08:59:13] <danheberden> gnarf you can rejoin
[08:59:16] <danheberden> without having to be rung in
[08:59:20] <gnarf> awesome
[08:59:22] <gnarf> afk a sec
[08:59:27] <danheberden> just click the call button on the group call after you've missed it
[08:59:30] <ajpiano> ping me when yr back, we can start then
[09:08:21] <danheberden> ♫ it's a quarter after one, i'm a little drunk and need ajpiano to call me now... ♫
[11:16:56] <gnarf> timmywil: yt?
[11:17:09] <timmywil> gnarf: yo
[11:17:32] <gnarf> curious if you had thoughts on my pulls today
[11:22:47] <timmywil> gnarf: im concerned about the added call on 420
[11:23:39] <gnarf> timmywil: yeah, i was thinking similarly, but was realizing as I was putting in the code that I was definately repeating myself :)
[11:24:36] <timmywil> gnarf: yea, sometimes that's ok in favor of performance.  In this case, it might be extra-important for animations
[11:24:55] <gnarf> that path is only followed once during animate
[11:25:00] <Jakey> gnarf are you who i think you are?
[11:25:04] <gnarf> maybe twive
[11:25:23] <timmywil> gnarf: good point
[11:25:30] <gnarf> animate only follows the get path to get initial state, its all set from there out
[11:25:36] <gnarf> Jakey: i dunno, who do you think i am?
[11:26:43] <timmywil> gnarf: ok, then maybe not so bad. think you could throw together a perf just so we can see if the loss is something to be concerned about?
[11:27:23] <gnarf> timmywil: umm, i think i can
[11:31:05] <timmywil> gnarf: i can make one later if you don't want to
[11:32:53] <timmywil> gnarf: I like your implementation of 422
[11:34:25] <timmywil> way to check for { margin: _, marginLeft: _ }
[11:35:25] <timmywil> hawtsauce
[11:35:39] <gnarf> timmywil: http://jsperf.com/jquery-hookget make sense to perf 420?
[11:36:12] <timmywil> gnarf: looks good to me, thanks!
[11:41:09] <gnarf> timmywil: i figure that unit test can get pulled in with whatever fix for animate to handle that :)
[11:41:09] <Jakey> gnarf, are you on another network?
[11:41:18] <gnarf> Jakey: IRC network?
[11:41:37] <gnarf> Jakey: long ago, but in the last 3 years or so, only freenode
[11:42:13] <Jakey> riight
[11:43:42] <gnarf> Jakey: *shrug*
[11:43:51] <gnarf> gnarf is apparently a somewhat common nick
[11:43:58] <gnarf> it has like a 50% taken percent :)
[11:50:15] <Jakey> :D
[13:05:01] <tbranyen> JohnResig: heads up but http://ejohn.org/category/blog/ is not working
[21:45:41] <addyosmani> kswedberg, when you get a chance would like to discuss a few doc related items with you. Another time maybe - I know your battery is about to go :)
[21:46:20] <kswedberg> ha. yeah, let's do it. this wknd maybe. I'll be on/off
[21:46:43] <addyosmani> sweet. that would be perfect@
[21:46:47] <addyosmani> *! as well.
