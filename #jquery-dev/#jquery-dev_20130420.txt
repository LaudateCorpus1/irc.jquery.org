[09:10:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you around?
[09:10:49] <gnarf> mikesherov: congrats btw ;)
[09:10:59] <DaveMethvin> gnarf yep
[09:11:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: need me to setup emails for mike and anne?
[09:11:41] <m_gol> gnarf, any way to tell why do we use jQuery-migrate on jQuery sites?
[09:11:46] <gnarf> cc mikesherov agcolom
[09:11:53] <DaveMethvin> i got a reply from mike, just waiting for anne to do both at once and send out a single welcome mail
[09:12:01] <DaveMethvin> tbh i am not sure i have all acess
[09:12:01] <m_gol> I'd like to eliminate it, I can fix some used plugins if that's needed but I'd have to have a way to narrow the problem down...
[09:12:15] <gnarf> m_gol: rworth may know?
[09:12:19] <DaveMethvin> noticed that i don't have Foundation on my dropbox for some reason
[09:12:34] <m_gol> ok, redirecting the question to rworth then ;)
[09:12:40] <gnarf> perhaps scott_gonzalez
[09:13:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: It's just called "jQuery" for me
[09:13:20] <gnarf> the dropbox
[09:13:43] <DaveMethvin> can you see /jQuery/Foundation gnarf?
[09:13:58] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: we moved all that stuff into _Archive and then are now using the folders per department
[09:14:21] <DaveMethvin> ok then the instructions in the wiki are out of date

[10:42:54] <agcolom> DaveMethvin: Just going to reply to your email now.
[10:43:04] <DaveMethvin> thanks agcolom!
[10:43:41] <agcolom> Thanks for everything btw :-) was my son's birthday yesterday so been spending time with him as I was at jquk yesterday
[10:43:54] <DaveMethvin> tell him happy birthday
[10:44:38] <agcolom> He says Thank you!
[10:46:07] <agcolom> DaveMethvin: preferred first name for me depends whether it's in conversation or official...
[10:46:27] <agcolom> in conversation it's Anne and official docs it's Anne-Gaelle
[10:46:43] <agcolom> (in French I use Anne-Gaelle and in English just Anne)
[10:46:43] <DaveMethvin> well, i'll be putting your name on jquery.org/team for example
[10:46:50] <DaveMethvin> i guess Anne-Gaelle there?
[10:47:00] <m_gol> new team members? :)
[10:47:05] <agcolom> yes
[10:47:07] <agcolom> please :-)
[10:47:11] <DaveMethvin> even better, board members!
[10:47:12] <DaveMethvin> ok
[10:52:24] <agcolom> DaveMethvin: do you need a short bio?
[10:52:40] <DaveMethvin> yes, thanks ... similar length/style to the ones there
[10:52:58] <agcolom> will do that now...
[13:16:11] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol gnarf: It's because of 3rd party plugins that we use.
[13:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/225
