[10:22:48] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[10:23:07] <DaveMethvin> periodic job not going well, m_gol?
[10:23:27] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: the job is fine, Android 4.3-4.4 isn't :(
[10:23:35] <m_gol> I added it an obviously it doesn't work
[10:23:35] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[10:23:49] <DaveMethvin> but it works okay manually?
[10:23:55] <m_gol> the weird thing is manually joining the swarm from BrowserStack's Androids 4.3-4.4 works, tests fire etc.
[10:24:02] <m_gol> but workers are not spawned
[10:24:12] <m_gol> logs don't even show attempts to spawn them
[10:24:22] <m_gol> I reported the issue to infra, I don't know where else to look
[10:24:42] <DaveMethvin> so it sounds like the problem is on our side then, not browserstack? if it's not spawning them even?
[10:24:49] <m_gol> arschmitz tried to narrow it down with me but I really don't know where it could be getting stuck so that it doesn't even spawn...
[10:24:54] <m_gol> yeah, maybe
[10:25:29] <m_gol> other than that, the move works; I also moved Operas to the periodic jobs
[10:25:39] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks
[10:26:10] <m_gol> I'm leaving those Androids there for now, I can periodically join the swarm manually to fire up accumulated jobs
[10:26:18] <m_gol> and maybe sb will figure out what's wrong
[10:26:23] <DaveMethvin> ok
[10:26:31] <m_gol> i.e. one of our infra folks :)
[10:26:59] <m_gol> I thought it's BrowserStack's fault but now I'm no longer so sure
[10:27:38] <m_gol> btw, I'd like to stop having to look at bugs.jquery.com... Do you mind me copying open tickets over?
[10:28:01] <DaveMethvin> can you get it to work? i can rarely get pages to open
[10:28:09] <DaveMethvin> if you want to give it a try, go for it!
[10:28:22] <m_gol> seems to work fine for me now, I can start
[10:28:33] <m_gol> so we're not creating component labels?
[10:29:06] <DaveMethvin> i wouldnt create them for the moment, do we need them?
[10:29:49] <m_gol> idk, I kinda liked them ;)
[10:30:05] <DaveMethvin> we talked about master-only and compat-only tags, anything not tagged would be  both branches
[10:30:21] <m_gol> yeah, right, we'll need those 2 labels
[10:30:37] <DaveMethvin> i looked at the angular repo, it's got a lot of tags :)
[10:30:42] <m_gol> haha, right
[10:30:44] <DaveMethvin> do you use them?
[10:30:48] <m_gol> and I sometimes cannot find the right one :P
[10:30:49] <m_gol> yes
[10:31:00] <m_gol> the triaging process is described in detail: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/TRIAGING.md
[10:31:08] <DaveMethvin> ah  let me look
[10:31:32] <m_gol> it makes sense if you have people that are more specialized in specific components
[10:31:37] <m_gol> which they do have
[10:31:47] <DaveMethvin> and so do we
[10:31:52] <m_gol> yeah
[10:31:59] <m_gol> we have fewer issues, though ;)
[10:32:13] <DaveMethvin> so was there a thought there about how the tags should look, they're like "Component: abc"
[10:32:19] <m_gol> yep
[10:32:19] <DaveMethvin> which gets kind of long
[10:32:28] <m_gol> you don't have to type it manually :)
[10:32:44] <DaveMethvin> i know but it does wrap a lot in the display
[10:32:52] <DaveMethvin> "severity: broken expected use"
[10:32:54] <DaveMethvin> :)
[10:33:04] <m_gol> yeah; example: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/9635
[10:33:41] <m_gol> `comp: selector` would fit
[10:33:53] <DaveMethvin> since  you're the one doing the work, if you want to tag components then i'm good with it
[10:34:03] <DaveMethvin> we can edit, change, add, or remove later
[10:35:01] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: i would move over the open tickets first, we can probably triage the new tickets and close at least half of them
[10:35:11] <m_gol> k
[10:35:13] <DaveMethvin> it took a while but the "new ticket" report did open for me
[10:35:23] <m_gol> haha
[10:35:41] <DaveMethvin> the list is really long and i don't recall getting email notification for most of these
[10:36:29] <DaveMethvin> oh man, some of them are 4 months old
[10:37:07] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: can you also create milestones master-next & compat-next?
[10:38:03] <DaveMethvin> i think there was going to be one milestone, 3.0.0 and the master-only and compat-only tags?
[10:38:23] <DaveMethvin> it just took 2 minutes to open a ticket
[10:38:28] <m_gol> ah, right
[10:38:29] <m_gol> yes
[10:38:39] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll create the milestones and tags
[10:38:47] <m_gol> so we need to change the existing 1.12/2.2 to 3.0
[10:38:56] <DaveMethvin> right
[10:38:57] <m_gol> and create the "next" milestone or sth like that
[10:38:59] <DaveMethvin> i'll do that
[10:44:33] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: you around?
[10:44:36] <DaveMethvin> ok, milestone changed and tags added
[10:44:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah arschmitz 
[10:44:49] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[10:44:55] <arschmitz> shouldnt that be ie8+ now?
[10:45:18] <DaveMethvin> technically the shipping release still supports IE6
[10:45:33] <arschmitz> oh right 1.12 is where its official right?
[10:45:37] <DaveMethvin> right
[10:45:50] <DaveMethvin> which will now most likely be jquery-compat 3.0
[10:45:52] <arschmitz> id been thinking it was 1.11 ok thanks
[10:46:01] <DaveMethvin> and that reminds me, i need to send an email out to jquery-devs-team
[10:46:09] <DaveMethvin> i'll do that now
[10:46:18] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol opened issue #1708: .position on table rows inside a relative div container gives different results based on scroll position 02http://git.io/6QkD6g
[10:47:08] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: any chance for a "moved" or "migrated" resolution on trac? :)
[10:47:33] <DaveMethvin> i think i can do that, lemme check
[10:48:13] <DaveMethvin> c'mon trac you can do it...
[10:48:28] <m_gol> hahaha
[10:48:42] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: you can create the "next" milestone on GitHub in the meantime ;)
[10:48:59] <DaveMethvin> haha yeah, no hurry
[10:49:06] <m_gol> or "future"; I wonder what's the best name
[10:49:27] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: you can probably also make a coffee before it loads
[10:49:30] <m_gol> ...or 3 coffees
[10:49:43] <DaveMethvin> maybe two milestones, a 3.next and future or something
[10:50:02] <DaveMethvin> i'll create with those names and we can edit as needed
[10:50:11] <m_gol> 3.next can just be a specific version
[10:50:19] <m_gol> and future is "we don't know when"
[10:50:58] <DaveMethvin> so there's 3.0.0 which is the next version, then the one after that, then "we don't know when"
[10:51:13] <DaveMethvin> or are you saying we don't need the one in the middle?
[10:51:28] <m_gol> yeah
[10:51:34] <DaveMethvin> technically anything not shipping in 3.0.0 is "we don't know when" :)
[10:51:37] <m_gol> we didn't have them on trac at least
[10:51:44] <DaveMethvin> ok
[10:52:03] <DaveMethvin> you should have "migrated" now in trac
[10:52:27] <DaveMethvin> just leave a link to the issue as well
[10:52:36] <m_gol> now I ONLY need to reload...
[10:52:45] <DaveMethvin> see you in 5 minutes
[10:52:51] <DaveMethvin> no make that 10
[10:52:52] <DaveMethvin> :)
[10:53:14] <m_gol> I actually cannot make a coffee during that time since sometimes it just gives a perfectly centered error message :P
[10:53:33] <DaveMethvin> haha

[11:09:05] <m_gol> I don't want to copy every comment individually, I did it in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1709 but that's tedious
[11:09:16] <DaveMethvin> i think that's fine, it preserves the discussion which is all we need
[11:09:51] <m_gol> I might also learn how to use the GitHub API for that and convert the Trac comment box structure to individual comments... not sure if worth the effort ;)
[11:10:12] <DaveMethvin> haha i was thinking about that a while back too
[11:10:26] <DaveMethvin> and decided it would be easier to manually port about 80 tickets
[11:10:56] <DaveMethvin> if it were more than 100 it might be worth the effort
[11:11:14] <DaveMethvin> but you just know it would take a bunch of tweaking to get just right

[11:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> If you didn't have to parse an RSS file or HTML to get the comments out of Trac, it'd actually be really easy.
[11:15:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why the CSVs don't provide comments. That'd make it so much easier.
[11:16:24] <scott_gonzalez> Of course with raw text, you'd need to do a fair amount of editing. Like Trac links to markdown links, {{{ to ```, etc.

[13:00:57] <agcolom> I have a question about best practice... I've had a look at some material (book and website companion for JavaScript and jQuery by Jon Duckett), and wanted to check something with you...
[13:01:07] <agcolom> he says: "When a variable holds a jQuery object, its name often begins with a $ symbol"
[13:01:30] <agcolom> and the example provided is "var $titles = $(‘.title’); "
[13:03:16] <agcolom> Now, I've not seen us use the $ symbol to start a variable name in either our docs or the learn center... 
[13:03:29] <agcolom> DaveMethvin: scott_gonzalez ^
[13:03:51] <DaveMethvin> some people like to do it but i wouldn't say it's required
[13:04:06] <agcolom> ok, thanks
