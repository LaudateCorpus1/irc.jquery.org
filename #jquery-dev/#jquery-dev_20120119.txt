[05:23:12] <mikesherov> .
[05:30:23] <mikesherov> addyosmani: http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines#JSLint is out of date
[05:31:11] <addyosmani> s/JSLint/JSHint BOOM :D
[05:31:21] <addyosmani> But I'll look into revising it.
[05:31:46] <addyosmani> Sure Anton has a useful guide we can also build on.
[05:32:52] <mikesherov_> oops
[05:37:00] <addyosmani> lol.
[05:37:15] <addyosmani> did you see my replies @ your JSLint msg?
[05:39:53] <mikesherov_> no
[05:39:58] <mikesherov_> :-\
[05:40:31] <mikesherov_> Ha
[05:40:35] <mikesherov_> I just checked the irc logs
[05:41:08] <mikesherov_> \/s\/JSLint\/JSHint
[05:42:08] <mikesherov_> Yeah, it's not much to change, but it came up when jq.Mobi was declaring that they didn't need to pass a linter because it didn't appear the other frameworks did
[05:42:09] <mikesherov_> LOL
[05:42:15] <mikesherov_> https://github.com/appMobi/jQ.Mobi/issues/7
[05:42:16] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #7 on jQ.Mobi, reported by ehynds (2d, 15h ago): lint the code
[05:44:37] <addyosmani> aha.
[05:44:44] <addyosmani> Yeah. We should definitely update that.
[05:45:33] <mikesherov_> yeah
[05:45:53] <addyosmani> I need to reconnect with the team working on the updates to the jQuery properties. I'm not sure where docs.jquery.com fits into that, but I'm sure they haven't forgot about it.
[05:45:57] <addyosmani> #famouslastwords
[05:47:18] <mikesherov_> lol
[05:48:00] <mikesherov_> i honestly believe thats docs are sometimes harder to do than the actual programming
[05:50:29] <addyosmani> I find the docs easier, but it depends on whether you have the patience for it. It can be a pain getting everything down, correct, formatted and what not.
[05:51:10] <mikesherov_> yeah, patience is not my strong suit
[05:51:18] <mikesherov_> except when it comes to smashing bugs
[05:51:37] <addyosmani> lol
[05:51:44] <addyosmani> well, you're doing that well.
[05:51:50] <mikesherov_> I try
[05:52:05] <addyosmani> I on the other hand need to get back into doing more jQ docs.
[05:52:10] <mikesherov_> there are a couple of types of devs: those who like new features, and those who like maintainence
[05:52:14] <addyosmani> somehow got myself into too many other projects. Need to reel back :)
[05:52:23] <addyosmani> I agree
[05:52:26] <mikesherov_> I'm a maintainence man
[05:52:34] <addyosmani> Well, we need those!
[05:52:39] <mikesherov_> I love figuring out the puzzle and finding a better way
[05:52:56] <mikesherov_> Yeah, I overextend myself often
[05:53:04] <mikesherov_> it seems like you're going a jillion things
[05:53:13] <addyosmani> I like the experimentation involved in newer features but improving the old can also be exciting
[05:53:16] <mikesherov_> those bootstraps you're doing are awesome
[05:53:21] <addyosmani> oh thanks.
[05:53:30] <addyosmani> Lots of work left to improve it, but it's getting there.
[05:53:35] <mikesherov_> yeah
[05:53:43] <mikesherov_> as long as it's going in the right direction
[05:53:49] <addyosmani> I'm hoping some day for it to be good enough to include the Themeroller gallery or something of the sort.
[05:53:49] <mikesherov_> and you're not getting burnt out
[05:54:07] <addyosmani> Yeah. That's always important
[05:54:19] <addyosmani> Managing not too bad right now. Just need to strike a balance :)
[05:54:31] <mikesherov_> balance is super important
[05:54:39] <addyosmani> Sure those jQuery issues you're patching up are taking up their fair time on your end
[05:54:50] <mikesherov_> in fact, I think it's the most important thing
[05:54:59] <mikesherov_> yeah, but it's a hobby
[05:55:07] <mikesherov_> I took a break from some other hobbies to accomodate
[05:55:14] <mikesherov_> like, I'm not reading as much now
[05:55:26] <addyosmani> hobbies like this are important.
[05:55:35] <mikesherov_> I'm sure a good book will change that right around and I'll have to stop some other thing like gaming
[05:55:38] <addyosmani> They tend to be more exciting than what we're doing at work quite regularly
[05:55:52] <mikesherov_> oh def
[05:55:52] <addyosmani> lol.
[05:56:13] <mikesherov_> I'm lead dev at my job, and most of my time is architecting and meetings, and helping other devs
[05:56:22] <mikesherov_> which is exciting and great, don't get me wron
[05:56:34] <mikesherov_> but it means I'm not as close to the code as I used to be
[05:56:53] <mikesherov_> jQuery keeps me sharp, helps me see why unit tests are important, linting, etc...
[05:57:01] <mikesherov_> those trickle back to the day job
[05:58:01] <addyosmani> I see that as one of the biggest reasons employers should consider giving away 20% of your time to OS stuff
[05:58:11] <addyosmani> if you do it right it can definitely feed back and improve your work projects
[05:58:12] <mikesherov_> yeah
[05:58:34] <mikesherov_> Trying to advocate for that at my job, not sure exactly how to structure it though
[05:59:28] <addyosmani> tbh, I don't officially get a % of time to work on anything OS
[05:59:48] <addyosmani> Convinced my line-manager there's value to letting me do it ad-hoc as long as it doesn't interfere with work and they seem to be okay with that
[05:59:56] <addyosmani> not working out too bad
[06:01:30] <mikesherov_> that's a good approach
[06:01:49] <mikesherov_> OK, I g2g
[06:01:55] <mikesherov_> thanks for the chat
[06:10:57] <addyosmani> anytime :)

[09:41:43] <danheberden> * NEW MESSAGE FROM /dev/null *
[11:52:00] <eddiemonge> danheberden: around?
[11:52:18] <danheberden> eddiemonge: yah what's up
[11:55:20] <eddiemonge> can you look at the cdn control panel to see if theres a way to refresh all files in a folder and if so recursively?
[11:55:45] <danheberden> they don't have a file manager unfortunately :/
[11:56:14] <danheberden> you can look at the reload script on code.origin and see what it does
[11:56:18] <danheberden> if there's a better way to recurse?
[11:57:37] <eddiemonge> wheres that script at?
[12:01:40] <danheberden> i have no idea, it should be reference in the apache config
[13:46:33] <fearphage> hello there. anyone know why the outro references the global `window` instead of `this`? is there some benefit or rationale that i'm missing?
[13:46:45] <fearphage> outro.js
[14:04:26] <eddiemonge> because this may not always be window
[14:04:50] <eddiemonge> and everything else expects window to be window
[15:25:21] <DaveMethvin> .
[15:25:22] <bot-t> (24 hours 10 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell DaveMethvin that I want to bring up JSHint undef:true at the next meeting
[16:19:05] <mikesherov> .
[16:19:20] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you get my message about the meeting on Monday?
[16:19:41] <DaveMethvin> yep, sure did
[16:20:03] <mikesherov> k, cool
[16:20:14] <mikesherov> I just think that if we wait for jshint to figure out hoisting before we turn on undef, we'll be waiting for a long time
[16:21:18] <DaveMethvin> right, so as i recall we'd need to rearrange some stuff so the defns come first? were there any specific gotchas?
[16:21:28] <mikesherov> no, I had it finished
[16:21:33] <mikesherov> passing all unit tests
[16:21:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah i remember the <big> commit
[16:21:59] <mikesherov> just that jaubourg didn't want to have to conform to it, because jshint should be smarter
[16:22:17] <DaveMethvin> everything shoudl be smarter
[16:22:19] <DaveMethvin> including me
[16:22:25] <mikesherov> and there was some cyclic stuff that needed a bit of more code than necessary, but nothing hard at all
[16:22:37] <mikesherov> again, it was minor stuff
[16:22:46] <mikesherov> so I just want to bring it up again on Monday
[16:23:03] <DaveMethvin> sounds good ... i also need to re-review everything that needs to land in 1.7.2
[16:23:23] <mikesherov> k
[16:23:50] <mikesherov> I'm looking to land another JSHint commit today actually though... they introduced "smarttabs"
[16:24:08] <mikesherov> which jaubourg was complaining about as well, for when spacing is used for alignment
[16:24:53] <mikesherov> Want me to keep the queue clean?
[16:24:58] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: so does it treat tabs == x spaces then?
[16:25:15] <mikesherov> no
[16:25:23] <mikesherov> it's actually pretty dumb
[16:25:58] <mikesherov> with smarttabs off: it's a regex that checks for: / \t|\t / that turns up a violation
[16:26:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah i read the description at jshint.com and can't figure out what the heck it did
[16:26:19] <mikesherov> with smart tabs on, the only violation is: / \t/
[16:26:31] <DaveMethvin> ok so that sounds good
[16:26:38] <mikesherov> so smarttabs literally allows spaces after tabs, but not before tabs
[16:26:51] <DaveMethvin> right like if you want to push something in a space
[16:26:57] <mikesherov> it's good for docblock
[16:27:06] <mikesherov> so tab size independence is still preserved
[16:27:17] <DaveMethvin> yep, good example
[16:27:50] <mikesherov> and in fact, I had to ruin some of the docbloc stuff jaubourg had to get jshint to pass the "trailing" check
[16:28:05] <mikesherov> I mean, the mixed tabs and spaces check
[16:28:12] <mikesherov> so I'm just going to knock that out tonight
[16:28:26] <mikesherov> figure I can appease jaubourg a  bit ahead of Monday :-P
[16:28:29] <DaveMethvin> sounds great, go ahead and make a pull request and i can land it asap
[16:28:37] <mikesherov> k, thanks
[16:29:00] <DaveMethvin> oh mikesherov you are the great conciliator :P
[16:29:10] <mikesherov> HAHA
[16:30:28] <mikesherov> ok, I'm off to do some coding... thanks again Dave

[18:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: you around?
[18:28:51] <DaveMethvin> yep
[18:29:12] <scott_gonzalez> I found a workaround for that IE 9 layout bug in the minHeight support test.
[18:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> If I access div.offsetHeight before setting the style properties, the bug goes away.
[18:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> I literally have a line that is just: `div.offsetHeight`
[18:29:59] <DaveMethvin> it sounds similar, the offsetHeight makes it recalc
[18:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> I'm a bit worried that it might get eaten by uglify though.
[18:30:19] <scott_gonzalez> well, the strange thing is that I have to do it before setting any style properties.
[18:30:40] <DaveMethvin> you would expect it to be the other way around i guess
[18:30:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, which is what I tried first.
[18:31:05] <DaveMethvin> and then you tried something futile and stupid :P
[18:31:14] <DaveMethvin> bonus!
[18:31:17] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, I'm working with IE :-)
[18:31:25] <DaveMethvin> haha
[18:34:26] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: BOOM https://github.com/jshint/jshint/pull/425
[18:34:27] <scott_gonzalez> Running a build now to see if uglify kills my fix.
[18:34:27] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jshint by antonkovalyov (1h, 28m ago): Fixed undef:true to respect function hoisting
[18:34:51] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[18:35:11] <mikesherov> committing the PR as we speak
[18:35:23] <mikesherov> just verifying that it catches the bugs it would caught before
[18:36:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, uglify didn't remove it :-)
[18:37:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah scott_gonzalez i think there's some similar one in sizzle, same kind of thing where jiggling the handle fixes a webkit bug
[18:37:15] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: maybe I'll try some stupid commits ... for testing purposes of course ;-)
[18:37:31] <DaveMethvin> like , undefined vars and such
[18:39:14] <mikesherov> Yeah, I just tested it against the last two times I can remember an undef got in there
[18:39:21] <mikesherov> newest version caught them both
[18:39:31] <mikesherov> but doesn't complain otherwise
[18:39:51] <mikesherov> I just used your previous "testing" commits ;-)
[18:40:02] <DaveMethvin> awwwww YEAH!
