[07:00:16] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: stop being so harassingly hard
[07:00:49] <DaveMethvin> blah blah blah :P
[07:00:49] <bot-t> (28 hours 30 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell DaveMethvin We're approaching double digits on duplicates for the dialog buttons issue :-P
[07:01:18] <DaveMethvin> geez bot-t, i'm glad it wasn't important
[07:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> heh, at this point I think we've actually reached double digits.
[07:01:31] <DaveMethvin> probably
[07:01:41] <DaveMethvin> but NOT ONE REPORT before we released
[07:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> We have 7 in UI Trac.
[07:02:02] <DaveMethvin> from now on the alpha will be x.x.0, the beta x.x.1
[07:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: To be fair, you broke it right before.
[07:02:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah, but only because i was tryna fix Mobile
[07:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> stupid mobile.
[07:02:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:02:38] <DaveMethvin> :D
[07:02:47] <DaveMethvin> bad choice on my part
[07:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if I'll have time to get the release done when I get home today.
[07:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> If not, I'll do the release tomorrow morning.
[07:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> Oh man, that guy is mad.
[07:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> "Yes, I'll try to post a simple test fiddle code. However If "dmethvin" lets us and doesn't close this Ticket as invalid like this..."
[07:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> How dare you close invalid tickets!
[07:07:19] <ajpiano> i love when people put "dmethvin" in quotes and talk about him like he's "some guy"
[07:07:25] <ajpiano> this isn't the first time it's happened
[07:07:31] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[07:07:34] <ajpiano> meanwhile if john closed the same ticket as invalid they'd be like
[07:07:56] <ajpiano> OMG *THE* JOHN RESIG TOOK TIME OUT OF HIS BUSY SCHEDULE TO CLOSE *MY* BUG AS INVALID! LOL IM SO DUMB. BEST DAY EVER
[07:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> For the next keynote, we should introduce Dave with air quotes.
[07:16:41] <DaveMethvin> lol
[07:16:56] <DaveMethvin> well....it looks like the microsoft cdn is having a bad day
[07:17:04] <DaveMethvin> normally i wouldn't care but it's breaking caniuse.com
[07:17:14] <DaveMethvin> i can haz caniuse? NO
[07:27:31] <equivoc> hi
[07:27:34] <equivoc> http://ideone.com/PqxxG
[07:27:48] <equivoc> sorry for that paste, but I don't know where else to report that bug
[07:28:15] <equivoc> with jquery 1.8.0 the text "Ok" won't show up on the button
[07:28:25] <equivoc> but it will show up with jquery 1.7.2
[07:29:35] <equivoc> http://ideone.com/NF3pN << the output from introspection of the button
[07:29:40] <equivoc> <span/> is empty
[08:10:41] <ajpiano> mikesherov: lol what's "dbr"
[08:10:51] <mikesherov> you know
[08:10:57] <mikesherov> Dr. Bu. Re.
[08:10:57] <ajpiano> i figure
[08:11:08] <mikesherov> Dra. Bug Rea.
[08:11:09] <ajpiano> ahhhhhh ;)
[08:11:15] <ajpiano> that's briliant
[08:11:29] <mikesherov> I mean, makes the job shorter for next year ;-)
[08:35:06] <tbranyen> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/tbranyen/backbone.layoutmanager/issues/132#issuecomment-7729654
[08:35:09] <tbranyen> some backup here please
[08:50:57] <tbranyen> thanks DaveMethvin :)
[08:51:04] <DaveMethvin> :D
[08:51:56] <tbranyen> try and do right by people and they don't even care :(
[08:53:14] <ajpiano> tbranyen: yea, and closing bugs as invalid is disrespectful
[09:36:53] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: did you guys do a writeup on the license changes in core?
[09:37:08] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: nope, not yet
[09:37:15] <DaveMethvin> thanks for the reminder though... :D
[09:37:27] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: ah, sorry didn't mean to imply you were behind :(
[09:37:35] <DaveMethvin> oh well I am!
[09:37:38] <johnbender> :D
[09:37:50] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: and just to be 100% clear the only difference is a removing the gpl.txt?
[09:38:04] <DaveMethvin> as i understand it ...
[09:38:08] * johnbender goes off to close that ticket
[09:38:22] <DaveMethvin> people can take our mit-licensed code and just release it with their changes as gpl
[09:38:27] <DaveMethvin> which is fine with me
[09:38:39] <DaveMethvin> it just simplifies our life to have a single simple license
[09:44:01] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: yar
[09:44:17] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I was just going to link in the commit message in case anyone is interested
[09:44:25] <johnbender> instead I added your email :P
[09:44:32] <DaveMethvin> gaaah! :D
[10:03:49] <elijahmanor> DaveMethvin: So it looks like the IE9 http://jqbug.com/12266 is a conflict with the core028.js library used by jsFiddle. If you recreate the issue listed in the ticket with JSBin, then the exception does not happen http://jsbin.com/onihul/4 The reason it fails in jsFiddle is that document[0] is somehow defined so the buildFragment method accesses (context[0] || context).ownerDocument https://githu
[10:03:49] <elijahmanor> b.com/appendto/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L493 & gets an exception. I'll see if I can find the unminified version of core028.js to see where things are going wrong. By the way, I can't seem to log into the tracker to add a comment to this ticket. Can someone reset my account. My username is elijahmanor
[10:04:33] <DaveMethvin> elijahmanor: thanks for digging into that, i noticed it was behaving differently on jsfiddle but hadn't tracked it down
[10:04:36] <elijahmanor> hmm that was weird... didn't mean to post two messages. ohh wells
[10:04:57] <DaveMethvin> i suspect it has something to do with document.id being a function
[10:05:00] <DaveMethvin> in jsfiddle
[10:05:12] <elijahmanor> ohh i didn't realize that
[10:05:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah, something (mootools?) is augmenting the heck out of document
[10:05:35] <DaveMethvin> use the debugger to inspect it
[10:05:48] <elijahmanor> DaveMethvin: I tried to reset my account, but didn't get an email (to tracker). Can someone reset it for me?
[10:07:08] <gnarf> elijahmanor: give me a minute, I'll PM you a password
[10:08:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah gnarf can probably do that easier, the admin interface wants to show me all users
[10:10:42] <elijahmanor> gnarf: ping
[10:11:00] <elijahmanor> gnarf: ohh, didn't see your message that you are on it ;)

[11:46:51] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[11:46:52] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #313: FIXED in 22 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/313/
[11:46:52] <doesallmagic> timmywillisn: Update Sizzle
[12:47:10] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: Y U FIX BUG AND BREAK MAH CODE! :D
[12:47:10] <b-ot> (屮'Д')屮
[12:47:23] <DaveMethvin> that was a good one tho
[12:47:34] <DaveMethvin> it was totally ignoring everything after the :input
[12:47:47] <gibson042> Sizzle swallowed the exception
[12:48:19] <DaveMethvin> gulp
[12:48:57] <gibson042> how would one get the idea that pipe-separating what would otherwise be an attribute selector matches on element name?
[12:49:58] <DaveMethvin> see, that's your problem gibson042, you're not creative enough!
[12:50:06] <gibson042> lol
[12:50:07] <DaveMethvin> if you can dream it, you can do it!
[12:50:10] <DaveMethvin> zombo.com
[12:50:22] <gibson042> jQuery("*{the elements I want}")
[12:50:39] <DaveMethvin> jQuery("the one on the left, no the one next to that")
[13:06:57] <Eviltwin> Yes, I'd like to be able to select by regular expression match on a nested value in a serialized JSON object in a data attribute of my element
[13:07:04] <Eviltwin> But it needs to be as fast as looking up by ID
[13:12:38] <DaveMethvin> and a pony, i want a pony too
[13:13:24] <ryanneufeld> my next tweet: DaveMethvin says 2.1 to come with a pony
[13:13:32] <gnarf> unicorn
[13:13:44] <DaveMethvin> hold on there gnarf, we shouldn't overpromise
[13:13:55] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: unicorns are just gay horses with strap-ons
[13:14:02] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[13:14:17] <ryanneufeld> I'm only kidding
[13:14:19] <DaveMethvin> you say that like it's a bad thing
[13:14:35] <ryanneufeld> I don't actually
[13:14:50] <ryanneufeld> Unicorns are fabulous
[13:15:03] <DaveMethvin> especially rainbowed ones
[13:15:18] <ryanneufeld> moar colors!
[13:15:25] <DaveMethvin> but we can only deliver 2 or 3 colors in jquery 2.1
[13:15:31] <DaveMethvin> it's a limitation of chrome
[13:15:42] <ryanneufeld> you misspelled IE
[13:15:58] <ryanneufeld> lol
[13:19:10] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: https://twitter.com/ryanneufeld/status/235470544676458497
[13:44:34] <ryanneufeld> rwaldron: hey sup
[13:48:22] <ryanneufeld> b-ot: tell rwaldron hey dude, msg me when you have a sec.
[13:48:22] <b-ot> ryanneufeld, I’ll tell rwaldron about that.
[14:51:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: whats our target for 1.8.1?
[14:51:19] <gnarf> I'd like to fix http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12273
[14:51:54] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i figured we'd do 1.8.1 next week
[14:52:00] <DaveMethvin> so fire away
[14:52:02] <gnarf> alright
[14:52:08] <gnarf> i'll try to get this fixed by the end of the week then
[16:53:36] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: so
[16:54:10] <paul_irish> http://paulirish.com/i/6f47b0.png i dont see that we received a 1.8.20 zip
[16:55:28] <snover> o shiiiiii
[16:55:33] <snover> bustedddddd
[16:56:22] <paul_irish> lol
