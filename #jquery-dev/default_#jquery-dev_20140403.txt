[11:06:27] <cmcnulty> I've noticed in a small handful of places, we skip qunit tests (eg JSON, CSS)... is that preferred over a conditional expect ( 0 )? 
[11:07:00] <cmcnulty> It seems like an expect( 0 ) has the advantage of being more verbose/transparent.
[11:23:20] <DaveMethvin> cmcnulty: not sure anyone thought too hard about it :) There was some discussion of a skipped-test feature for qunit at https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/434
[11:28:55] <cmcnulty> Thanks for pointing me to that...
[11:29:33] <DaveMethvin> cmcnulty: thanks for looking at the unit tests!
[11:29:55] <cmcnulty> I'm revisiting Sizzle pull #244
[11:30:13] <cmcnulty> And it would be nice to test *something*
[11:30:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[11:30:33] <cmcnulty> but figuring out what I can test that will pass al sizzle browsers is... challenging.
[11:31:12] <cmcnulty> actually, impossible, so I've been implementing some crazy conditionals in the tests.
[11:31:31] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15dmethvin opened issue #472: .on() should document that handler accepts .trigger() args 02http://git.io/YVmibw
[11:31:36] <DaveMethvin> some sort of "skipped because this browser is to lame" would be good
[11:31:46] <cmcnulty> which seems better than nothing - though of course you don't want to setup a condition where a browser fix causes a unit test fail.
[11:32:20] <cmcnulty> In particular PhantomJS falls into the lame category.
[11:32:25] <DaveMethvin> that wouldn't be the end of the world, it would let us know the workaround wouldn't be needed at some point
[11:32:42] <DaveMethvin> all the tests in support.js are essentially doing that
[11:33:07] <DaveMethvin> calling PhantomJS lame is giving it too much credit.
[11:33:14] <cmcnulty> :)
[11:35:55] <cmcnulty> Tangentially related note, is Opera 9 tested against Sizzle?  Because I'm getting 35 failures at the moment.
[11:36:29] <DaveMethvin> i doubt it is ... Opera 9? Where did you get that from, 2003?
[11:37:59] <cmcnulty> 2003 called, and I had them fax me a bunch of install files.
[11:38:13] <cmcnulty> I grabbed it from archive.org actually.
[11:38:27] <DaveMethvin> or myspace
[11:38:58] <cmcnulty> I was just going off of this: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/wiki/Sizzle-Documentation#browsers
[11:39:26] <DaveMethvin> easier to update the docs I'd think :)
[11:39:29] <cmcnulty> so I grabbed it - the hardest to find was actually Safari 3
[11:39:54] <cmcnulty> had to do a little URL manipulation to get it from apple.com
[11:40:02] <snover> apparently cmcnulty does not know of oldversion.com :)
[11:40:03] <cmcnulty> now you tell me. :)
[11:40:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah i just checked they have it
[11:40:34] <cmcnulty> I mean oldversion.com was the first google hit, obv, but wasn't necessarily sure I could trust it.
[11:41:04] <cmcnulty> Though, the backwaters of a major corporate domain isn't necessarily safe water either.
[11:41:29] <cmcnulty> Plus, I like a challenge.
[11:41:41] <DaveMethvin> if it's that hard to find, i suspect we don't need to support it 
[11:41:55] <DaveMethvin> and shouldn't say we do!
[11:42:14] <cmcnulty> If browserstack.com doesn't test it, I think it's safe to assume that no one does.
[11:42:31] <cmcnulty> and they both cut off at Safari 4 and Opera 10
