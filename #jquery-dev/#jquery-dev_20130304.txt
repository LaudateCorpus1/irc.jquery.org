[09:01:20] <DaveMethvin> ohai
[09:01:30] <DaveMethvin> i'm at the jquery board meeting
[09:01:50] <DaveMethvin> so let's skip the core meeting today
[09:57:02] <JamesMGreene> Anyone around who can tell me more about the $.ajax `dataFilter` functionality?
[10:07:30] <gnarf> JamesMGreene: see `ask
[10:07:33] <gnarf> `ask
[10:07:33] <b-ot> gnarf: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:07:44] <gnarf> someone im sure could help
[10:17:53] <rso3cin> Hey guys! I am a student of computer science, from Federal University of Pernambuco. Me and a colleague would really like to contribute to jquery development. It was a request from a teacher who lectures about Open Source software. Do you have any advise or tips for us? Where do we begin, what to learn first?
[10:21:18] <rso3cin> We read the getting involved and we are working to build jquery and run tests. We know that we need to volunteer to resolve a bug, but we would like to know if there is any bug or enhancement you recomend for starters
[10:22:06] <DaveMethvin> hi rso3cin! I'm in a meeting and having to run  in a minute but i'd definitely recommend you check out contribute.jquery.org
[10:28:04] <JamesMGreene> good call, gnarf
[10:28:34] <JamesMGreene> This time around, I just looked at the source and validated my thoughts on it (that what my colleague told me was incorrect)
[10:30:52] <rso3cin> Thank you, DaveMethvin! I checked contribute.jquery.org last week and signed, but I got no emails so far. Is it normal? Is it better to try to sign again? I also read some topics, like dive in contribution and code style, but I will read more for sure. 
[10:31:12] <ajpiano> there are no e-mails you should have received :)
[10:31:32] <rso3cin> oh
[10:31:55] <rso3cin> Do we get any help about where to start understanding the code?
[10:31:59] <ajpiano> it's just a step you have to complete so that we can accept changes you make
[10:32:12] <ajpiano> that is a bit of a different story :)
[10:32:55] <ajpiano> we don't really have a "guide" per se of how the code works
[10:33:49] <rso3cin> oh... how was it for you to start development?
[10:34:24] <ajpiano> i don't really work on jquery core :)
[10:34:34] <ajpiano> most folks start by using jQuery a lot
[10:34:43] <ajpiano> then trying to understand how things work when they try to fix bugs
[10:34:57] <ajpiano> brb - i'm in the same room as DaveMethvin :)
[10:35:06] <rso3cin> alrights
[10:37:12] <rso3cin> I'm here okay. Tell me when you return
[10:37:51] <ajpiano> hey
[10:37:56] <ros3cin> hi
[10:38:12] <ajpiano> so, it really depends a lot on how much jquery experience you have
[10:40:02] <ajpiano> what and how you'll be able to contribute
[10:40:41] <ajpiano> another good way to get started is to get involved with bug triage
[10:40:42] <ajpiano> http://contribute.jquery.org/triage/
[10:43:50] <ajpiano> to see how the team typically reacts to issues as they come in
[10:45:09] <ajpiano> and also there lots of other projects under the jQuery umbrella than just jQuery core
[10:45:51] <ros3cin> I am recording your advices*
[10:46:05] <ros3cin> to which project do you contribute?
[10:51:29] <ros3cin> Me and my colleague do not have much experience in jQuery. But we started using and studying in web applications, and we are enjoying.
[10:52:23] <ajpiano> ros3cin: i am the developer relations and marketing lead for the jquery foundation
[10:53:15] <ajpiano> so i work on content and docs and coordinating site designs and communicating with the community, working on conferences, etc
[10:53:43] <ros3cin> oh! pleased to meet you XD
[10:54:06] <ajpiano> :)
[10:54:45] <ajpiano> so we use the same open source workflows for committing documentation and design as well as code
[10:56:39] <ajpiano> what is the nature of your coursework?
[10:56:39] <snover> also works on his dance moves
[10:56:50] <ajpiano> to begin to contribute to an open source project?
[10:57:26] <JamesMGreene> As another example: I work on the testing team, so my projects include QUnit core, QUnit addons, and TestSwarm
[10:59:59] <ros3cin> what do you mean by nature of my coursework? Is it about the way I want to contribute? 
[11:06:22] <ajpiano> ros3cin: yes
[11:06:50] <ajpiano> just feeling inspired, or do you have a requirement as part of your class?
[11:10:11] <ros3cin> It is a requirement of the class, but our preference for jquery is because we like it. We know that it is a huge and famous project. But if we manage to get in, we may continue contributing.
[11:10:30] <T-Gunn> hello all, i am trying to extend a googlemaps plugin for some features i need/want.. i added a function to do reverse geocoding and I am trying to get the city, county, state and country based on the click in the map.. i am having a problem with scope because within the geocoder.geocode() it is defined but once i get out of it it becomes undefined. even variables like this.city that i define 
[11:10:30] <T-Gunn> in init() lose their value after it gets out of geocode(). how can I maintain the information outside of geocode() ?
[11:11:24] <ros3cin> WeÂ´ve also looked some of your guides and docs in github, and they are very welcoming
[11:12:55] <ajpiano> ros3cin: awesome -- that's good news
[11:13:21] <ajpiano> i guess what i am saying is that you might be able to learn more and also contribute more by looking at other aspects of jQuery beyond just core
[11:15:18] <T-Gunn> sorry, just read the topic, i assumed -dev would mean help developing jquery plugins.. very sorry
[11:17:11] <ros3cin> you mean other projects or learning more about it?
[11:17:47] <ros3cin> using more*
[11:42:45] <ros3cin> ajpiano: Other aspects of jQuery you mentioned is using more and learn more or looking into api, UI, mobile? Do you expect me to try fixing or contributing with plugin ? If I think I'm able to help fixing something, do I just say in the ticket or in the issue?
[11:43:25] <ajpiano> ros3cin: indeed
[12:17:43] <paul_irish> anyone here an owner for jquery-devs-team ?
[12:17:47] <paul_irish> I believe there is a setting to allow anyone to post but the group is still invite only. that's perfect, as sometimes (like this jsleakcheck thread) you need to include someone outside the group
[12:17:53] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin|away: ajpiano ^
[12:18:59] <ajpiano> paul_irish: what needs to change
[12:19:15] <paul_irish> lemme find setting
[12:20:03] <paul_irish> https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!groupsettings/jquery-devs-team/basic
[12:20:15] <paul_irish> all members, anyone, anyone can ask
[12:20:17] <paul_irish> probably best.
[12:20:19] <paul_irish> ajpiano: 
[12:21:04] <ajpiano> i don't think i'm an owner
[12:24:14] <ajpiano> and DaveMethvin|away is traveling atm
[12:43:49] <gnarf> i'll see if i have access
[13:07:31] <gnarf> paul_irish: what did you want us to do?
[13:07:50] <paul_irish> open up jquery-devs-team so non members can post to it gnarf
[13:08:19] <paul_irish> i have a few of my lists like that. closed to joining but open for posting
[13:08:22] <paul_irish> works nice
[13:08:56] <gnarf> paul_irish: so without the ability to view the messages
[13:08:59] <gnarf> how would they know to post on them
[13:27:07] <paul_irish> gnarf: they'd be included on a thread
[13:27:20] <paul_irish> like.. the list is talking about something but you want to cc in james burke, for example
[13:27:32] <paul_irish> or i email the group to introduce someone who wants to help with a memory leak detector
[13:29:25] <paul_irish> make sense?
[13:58:50] <gnarf> paul_irish: yeah, so if you include them on a CC, it will add them to that thread only and cc all the other replies to them?
[14:11:45] <paul_irish> yes
[14:11:47] <paul_irish> gnarf: exactly
[14:11:49] <paul_irish> but curently they cannot reply to that thread.
[14:11:57] <gnarf> seems good, changed it
[14:12:07] <paul_irish> cool
[14:12:49] <paul_irish> gnarf: http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/04/animating-web-gonna-need-bigger-api/ your raf plugin is in here
[14:20:20] <gnarf> danheberden / mikesherov: https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS2/commit/26746ce3167a768479435588dd9099bb7408018f we could enable this for jQuery 2.0 yeah?
[14:20:21] <b-ot> gnarf: Mihai Bazon (2d 9h ago): Add `--screw-ie` option  For now the implication is that UglifyJS will not leak a function expression's name in the surrounding scope (IE < 9 does that).  (ref. mishoo/UglifyJS#485)
