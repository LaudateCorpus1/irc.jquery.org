[11:54:39] <johnkpaul> DaveMethvin: I am checking on Chrome 32
[11:54:41] <johnkpaul> how can I install an older version of canary?
[11:54:51] <johnkpaul> oh no, disregard
[11:54:56] <johnkpaul> didn't realize chrome 31 is stable right now

[12:39:28] <m_gol> seems almost everything fails on ajax now
[12:42:30] <m_gol> Krinkle: can you add Win8 IE11, Opera 17 (you can remove 15) and Chrome 30 to TestSwarm? They're available now
[12:42:48] <m_gol> * Win 8.1
[12:43:26] <m_gol> Safari 7 is available as well
[12:43:29] <m_gol> lots of updating :)
[12:47:04] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: is there any bug tracker for the infra team so that we could report needed upgrades like this one?
[12:49:22] <m_gol> Fx 25 is on Browserstack as well now
[12:49:38] <m_gol> which means all the browsers need to be updated ;)
[20:17:03] <JamesMGreene> Anyone around that has an EPS editor (e.g. Adobe Illustrator, or Photoshop, Inkscape, etc.) installed and is willing to do me a quick favor?
