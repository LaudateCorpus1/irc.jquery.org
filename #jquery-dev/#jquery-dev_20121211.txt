[05:27:55] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin rwaldron: style question :-)
[05:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> I've noticed that there are random places in core that have a blank line as the first line of a function or a hash.
[05:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> Should those all go away or are there reasons for them?
[05:36:00] <gibson042> .
[05:53:35] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i am not sure why those are there, we have generally left no space between the top of the function and a var, then a line between the var and the rest of the code
[05:53:45] <DaveMethvin> so maybe if there is no var, a space?
[05:55:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just link to a few places and we'll see if they should go away.
[05:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/4258737#L131
[05:55:17] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/4258737#L158
[05:55:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/4258737#L191
[05:55:42] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/4258737#L236
[05:56:02] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/4258737#L395
[05:56:16] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/4258737#L529
[05:56:18] <DaveMethvin> so i think a lot of those are because of the comment, right? generally we put a blank line over a comment
[05:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/4258737#L867
[05:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so that's the rule?
[05:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> That does seem consistent.
[05:57:53] <DaveMethvin> well the last one seems unusual to me
[05:58:13] <DaveMethvin> i guess there were no vars so no blank line
[05:58:24] <DaveMethvin> and then the blank line after the if ... ?
[05:58:27] <DaveMethvin> but for the comment, yeah
[05:58:47] <DaveMethvin> but then again, later in the same fn we don't put a blank line after the commet
[05:59:13] <DaveMethvin> i think we should ask rwaldron :D
[05:59:42] <DaveMethvin> i'm okay with any rule that is obvious enough to be followed
[05:59:52] <DaveMethvin> or we can leave it coder's choice

[06:49:04] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I've figured out why fixing all these tests is so painful. It now seems obvious.
[06:49:50] <scott_gonzalez> The doubled up event made the widget code think focus was happening synchronously, so the tests actually ran fine synchronously.
[06:49:52] <DaveMethvin> why?
[06:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> The code doesn't *really* care whether the elements are focused.
[06:50:12] <DaveMethvin> oh!
[06:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> So if we did something like element.focus().simulate( some key press )
[06:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> The widget would think the element is actually focused and receiving key events.
[06:51:19] <scott_gonzalez> But in reality it's not focused and then when the test ends, QUnit blows everything away and the focus never actually happens.
[06:51:44] <scott_gonzalez> Now that we don't get the synthetic sync event, we have to wait for the actual focus to happen, and all the tests must now be async.
[06:52:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i had a similar experience making a unit test
[06:52:25] <scott_gonzalez> Alternatively, we could keep the tests sync with .triggerHandler( "focus" ).
[06:52:34] <scott_gonzalez> It would make writing tests a lot easier, but not as real-world.
[06:52:41] <scott_gonzalez> So async it is.

[07:11:29] <gibson042> hey
[07:11:42] <mikesherov> sup rwaldron 
[07:11:54] <rwaldron> Some folks at Mozilla are putting together a press thing for MDN and have reached out to me for "a nice word to share about MDN."
[07:12:13] <rwaldron> ie, from jQuery
[07:12:17] <DaveMethvin> "MDN doesn't sweat much for a fat lady"
[07:12:31] <rwaldron> original: "Paul Jarratt (cc'ed) is putting together an end-of-the-year press piece on MDN and he'd be interested in knowing if some people in the jQuery team had a nice word to share about MDN."
[07:12:45] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin that's true
[07:12:54] <DaveMethvin> "MDN is my go-to reference...after w3schools"
[07:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> MDN: Better than WebPlatform.org.
[07:13:30] <rwaldron> apropos of nothing, I just used the "two men holding hands" emoji in a jQuery PR comment
[07:13:31] <DaveMethvin> which moz was supposed to be contributing to
[07:13:45] <DaveMethvin> hmm, sounds gay to me
[07:13:49] <DaveMethvin> not that there's anything wrong with that
[07:13:54] <rwaldron> talk to scott_gonzalez and mikesherov
[07:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I talked to Doug Schepers about that.
[07:14:10] <rwaldron> i used it to signify their great teamwork
[07:14:29] <DaveMethvin> better than :punch:
[07:14:32] <rwaldron> +1
[07:14:38] <scott_gonzalez> He said that Mozilla is ultimately in favor of WebPlatform, but I have yet to see that in practice.
[07:14:43] <rwaldron> Ok, can we come up with something so I can email this guy?
[07:15:05] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure what to say
[07:15:19] <rwaldron> something like "we believe in this and are committed to it and blah blah blah, great stuff"
[07:15:25] <DaveMethvin> it seems strange they'd relaunch right after webplatform but i'm sure this has been in the works for a while
[07:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> I use it to look stuff up faster than checking specs.
[07:15:32] <DaveMethvin> yes
[07:15:49] <rwaldron> sooo
[07:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> Just the other day I used it to check the defaults for min-height and max-height.
[07:16:01] <DaveMethvin> faster, more practical than the w3c site
[07:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:16:45] <gibson042> "great for its concise representation of web standards"
[07:16:47] <DaveMethvin> so maybe "if you want to know the official word about how something works, go to the w3c site. If you want to know how it really works, go to MDN."
[07:16:48] <rwaldron> "MDN is the quickest and easiest resource for finding practical and accurate information" - jQuery Core Team
[07:17:02] <rwaldron> I like that
[07:17:18] <rwaldron> but maybe we can avoid digs on other projects?
[07:17:45] <scott_gonzalez> MDN is a great resource for quickly finding the information you need without poring through multiple specs for the relevant information.
[07:18:12] <rwaldron>  "If you want to know the official word about how something works, read the spec. If you want to know how it really works, go to MDN."
[07:18:36] <DaveMethvin> +1 on scott's 
[07:18:50] <DaveMethvin> sorry got a phone call
[07:19:06] <rwaldron> cool, I can get behind scott_gonzalez's as well.
[07:19:10] <rwaldron> I'll send them that
[07:19:15] <gibson042> scott's minus the last 4 words
[07:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> Sure.
[07:19:44] <scott_gonzalez> I think the biggest gain from MDN is having info that spans tons of specs in a single place.
[07:19:52] * rwaldron grumble
[07:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> It's organized well and has a decent search.
[07:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Why the grumble? Everyone just agreed on something :-)

[07:21:28] <rwaldron> I'm visiting Bocoup office, so I dont have IRC on a sep window
[07:21:56] <rwaldron> Ok... final word is:

[07:23:53] <rwaldron> great, sent
[07:28:34] <rwaldron> mikesherov ping
[07:29:04] <mikesherov> hi rwaldron 
[07:29:21] <rwaldron> mikesherov Is it possible for augmentWidthOrHeight to return any of the following: NaN, null or undefined
[07:29:28] <mikesherov> um
[07:29:41] <mikesherov> lemme check, and why do you ask?
[07:30:33] <rwaldron> in one call to setPositiveNumber, its return value is passed as the third argument, ie. "subtract"
[07:30:42] <mikesherov> rwaldron: no, every value is coerced to numeric
[07:30:51] <rwaldron> inside setPositiveNumber, there is an expression ( substract || 0 )
[07:31:52] <rwaldron> I'm wondering if we could track down calls to setPositiveNumber and ensure that the third arg is a number
[07:31:52] <rwaldron> and then remove the || 0
[07:31:52] <rwaldron> Math.max( 0, matches[ 1 ] - ( subtract || 0 ) ) + ( matches[ 2 ] || "px" ) =>
[07:32:06] <rwaldron> Math.max( 0, matches[ 1 ] - subtract ) + ( matches[ 2 ] || "px" )
[07:32:37] <mikesherov> rwaldron: lemme check, that's a good call
[07:33:09] <rwaldron> mikesherov could be defensive for this...
[07:33:09] <rwaldron> jQuery.cssHooks[ prefix + suffix ].set = setPositiveNumber;
[07:35:04] <mikesherov> rwaldron: oh yeah, that is definitely it, it's because no third argument is set there
[07:35:20] <mikesherov> and so the undefined needs to be coerced to 0 for the mathiness of it all
[07:35:35] <mikesherov> but augmentWidthOrHeight definitely returns a number
[07:35:50] <rwaldron> awesome
[07:36:19] <rwaldron> maybe scott_gonzalez would like to squeeze a comment for that line into his PR
[07:36:24] * rwaldron nudge nudge wink wink
[07:36:27] <rwaldron> :)
[07:36:52] <scott_gonzalez> heh, sure
[07:38:39] <rwaldron>   // Guard against undefined "subtract" arguments that occur when setPositiveNumber is called as jQuery.cssHooks[ prefix + suffix ].set
[07:38:41] <rwaldron> or something
[07:38:46] <rwaldron> that's kind of wordy
[07:38:57] <scott_gonzalez> I wrote: // subtract might not be passed, such as when used as a cssHook
[07:39:37] <rwaldron> works for me
[07:40:01] <scott_gonzalez> It starts lowercase because of the var name, is that ok?
[07:40:12] <rwaldron> In about 2 years, this won't even be an issue
[07:40:26] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez makes sense to me
[07:41:08] <scott_gonzalez> / Guard against undefined "subtract", e.g., when used as a cssHook
[07:41:28] <scott_gonzalez>  /a cssHook/in cssHooks/
[07:42:33] <scott_gonzalez> While we're talking about css.js...
[07:42:40] <scott_gonzalez> Any reason not to change https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/css.js#L578 to:
[07:42:49] <scott_gonzalez> return computed && curCSS( elem, "marginRight" );
[07:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> That should keep the same semantics, right?
[07:45:12] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/2d1Q2L1U2D1M :-P
[07:50:18] <gibson042> scott_gonzalez: no, we want it to return undefined when computed === false
[07:52:41] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/css.js#L211
[08:00:24] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok, thanks

[11:02:22] <Krinkle> oh really, it was just merged just now
[11:02:25] <Krinkle> I thought they were merged alreayd :)
[11:03:09] <mikesherov> Krinkle: I like to let my pulls sit for a bit
[11:03:14] <mikesherov> :-)
[11:10:10] <Krinkle> Isn't this supposed to give a collection with 1 element?
[11:10:11] <Krinkle> $('<body> <u><u></u></u> <s></s> <div id="qunit"></div> <i></i> <p><i></i></p> </body>')
[11:10:31] <Krinkle> I'm getting an array with 11 elements (few text nodes), but no <body>
[11:10:48] <Krinkle> and they all have #document-fragment as parentNode
[11:10:58] <DaveMethvin> you can't use <body> inside a <div>
[11:11:06] <DaveMethvin> which is how we conjure up the elements 
[11:11:07] <Krinkle> who's doing that?
[11:11:17] <DaveMethvin> $("html") is doing that for you
[11:11:31] <Krinkle> I mean, I'm not putting a body inside a div
[11:11:43] <DaveMethvin> div.innerHTML = '<body> <u><u></u></u> <s></s> <div id="qunit"></div> <i></i> <p><i></i></p> </body>'
[11:11:50] <DaveMethvin> that's what we're doing
[11:11:53] <Krinkle> I know
[11:12:01] <DaveMethvin> and body disappears
[11:12:03] <DaveMethvin> in many browsers
[11:12:05] <Krinkle> I know, but I thought we look into the string and special case certain things
[11:12:11] <Krinkle> such as <td> gets a table
[11:12:12] <DaveMethvin> but not body
[11:12:32] <DaveMethvin> we would need a document element
[11:13:51] <Krinkle> and we can't always use doc.createElement('html') as host, because it inserts <head> and <body> always
[11:14:14] <DaveMethvin> and i'm not sure that works in oldie anyway
[11:14:18] <Krinkle> using document element as host wouldn't help, it would have a <body> but not because of the innerHTML, document always has a body
[11:14:20] <DaveMethvin> there's createDocument
[11:14:48] <DaveMethvin> but anyway, slinging html with a body or head element is a losing game :D
[11:15:04] <snover> oh geez

[15:27:33] <Zak> hi. I'm looking at testswarm. I just want to know if there's a way to configure the iframe size in RunPage?
[15:31:36] <Zak> looking at run.js, it looks like the iframe height/width are hardcoded
[15:47:40] <Zak> is it bad if i modify the iframe to be much bigger?
[16:03:09] <Krinkle> Zak: What does it matter? Nobody is going to look at the RunPage, only run clients
[16:03:26] <Krinkle> The test suite runs automatically
[16:03:39] <Krinkle> you can view the results from the Job page afterwards at whatever size you prefer.
[16:12:29] <Zak> Krinkle: i was looking at integrating some screenshot capability into testswarm
[16:12:48] <Zak> what i'm trying to do is a bit hacky, but it would be a lot easier to integrate it with testswarm than to redesign the whole thing from scratch
[16:12:58] <Krinkle> Zak: Then you're probably doing the wrong things with the wrong tools.
[16:13:19] <Krinkle> Zak: TestSwarm already aggregates the entire HTML dom for viewing anything specific
[16:13:21] <Zak> there's not many good tools out there for automation, esp cross-browser
[16:13:29] <Krinkle> That is already beyond unit testsing
[16:13:46] <Krinkle> If you need visual confirmation, then there no automatic assertive behaviour I presume
[16:13:53] <Zak> no
[16:14:02] <Zak> it's more about sanity
[16:14:10] <Zak> err, automation i mean
[16:14:25] <Krinkle> Zak: And how do you plan on making a screenshot in a browser?
[16:14:31] <Zak> we really want to see what our webpages look like on different browsers
[16:14:41] <Zak> Krinkle: the screenshot happens at the OS level
[16:15:16] <Zak> there would be a number of assumptions about how the whole thing is set up
[16:15:21] <Krinkle> Zak: I think what you're looking for is much simpler than Jenkins or TestSwarm
[16:15:33] <Krinkle> And also in a very different area of software than these
[16:15:42] <Krinkle> Zak: Where do these browsers come from in your setup?
[16:16:10] <Zak> that's true, we could do it through something like Jenkins or Bamboo
[16:16:23] <Krinkle> not Jenkins, I was recommending not Jenkins
[16:16:27] <Zak> right
[16:16:59] <Zak> to summarize, we want to be able to take screenshots of our webpage (or portions of it) in different browsers
[16:17:05] <Krinkle> Zak: Assuming you're using browserstack, saucelabs or crossbrowsertesting.com to get the actual browsers automatically in the swarm, I recommend you use the intergrated solutions with those platforms to generate screenshots
[16:17:05] <Zak> in particular, the IE series
[16:17:20] <Krinkle> Then TestSwarm is the wrong approach, it isn't related not suitable for that need.
[16:17:39] <Krinkle> TestSwarm doesn't have browsers, it connects browsers.
[16:18:04] <Krinkle> so you still need VMs with IE somewhere, wherever you get those from, that has screenshot factory capabilities built in probably
[16:18:19] <Krinkle> for example, if you use SauceLabs to get IE  browsers on-demand, it has a screenshot factory built-in
[16:18:26] <Zak> we don't want to use a service and it's difficult doing that, because our site isn't normally exposed on the internet
[16:18:26] <Krinkle> and the same for CrossBrowserTesting.com
[16:18:39] <Krinkle> they both support tunnnels for localhost
[16:18:44] <Zak> right
[16:18:53] <Zak> i took at look at browserling too
[16:18:59] <Krinkle> Yep, that's another one
[16:19:16] <Zak> i guess the main impediment, is the idea of paying for a service that does this
[16:19:23] <Zak> but you are right, these are the right tools for this job
[16:19:28] <Krinkle> Either way, you're going to need browsers. Either a self-maintained vm cluster (maybe Selenium Grid?, beware though, it is a monster to maintain, I have done it a few times)
[16:19:36] <Zak> thanks for refering saucelabs too. i just took a look; they've got video recording, which is neat
[16:19:42] <Krinkle> Yep
[16:19:48] <Zak> nah, we have tried to use selenium. its a pos
[16:19:51] <Krinkle> And the source of those browsers likely has basic screenshot stuff built-in
[16:19:53] <Zak> we kept having issues with IE
[16:20:03] <Zak> and its slow
[16:20:16] <Krinkle> yeah I know, we (me at Wikimedia) shut down our Selenium Grid last year too.
[16:20:40] <Krinkle> too much maintenance, too slow, and sometimes inconsistencies between it and the real OS/browsers.
[16:20:41] <Zak> i still might pursue this option with testswarm
[16:20:51] <Zak> i know its not entirely correct, but these other options aren't available to me
[16:20:58] <Zak> (it's not my business and they're tight on the budget)
[16:21:04] <Zak> if it were me, i would definitely utilize them
[16:21:12] <Krinkle> There's a lot of great stuff in TestSwarm, but no matter how much I love it, I'm not sure you're going to be satisfied by using it as a basis for this.
[16:21:31] <Zak> yeah, there's already a lot of compromise in the solution i'm proposing
[16:21:39] <Zak> i.e. can't take  screenshot of the iframe alone
[16:21:49] <Zak> that's e.g., not i.e.
[16:22:04] <Krinkle> considering TestSwarm can't take screenshots, and you're still going to need to get browsers somehow... not sure where you'd spend the budget on.
[16:22:20] <Zak> our company is weird
[16:22:26] <Krinkle> gotta go :)
[16:22:28] <Zak> with budgeting. that's another conversation
[16:22:31] <Zak> thanks for your help krin
[16:22:33] <Zak> awe
[17:14:01] <DaveMethvin> okay, lessee what's in the q here
[19:06:59] <DaveMethvin> i am so tired of oldie

[20:17:23] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: sorry about the collision ... i think i'm spent for tonight
[20:17:48] <gibson042> there was a collision? don't even worry about it
[20:18:21] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at testswarm, lemme see whether these are normal failures
[20:18:41] <DaveMethvin> i think they are
[20:18:46] <gibson042> I hate that stupid IE8 pixel glitch
[20:19:24] <gibson042> what brought it back, anyway?
[20:19:25] <DaveMethvin> it's just a pain to need to check every run and see if the fails are expected
[20:19:28] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[20:19:33] <DaveMethvin> something in testswarm
[20:23:27] <pbramos_> Anyone know what's up with https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1068
[20:23:29] <pbramos_> Just checking
[20:23:45] <DaveMethvin> i was hoping to land it tonight pbramos_
[20:23:54] <pbramos_> ok sweet
[20:23:59] <DaveMethvin> i started at the bottom of the pile and am working up
[20:24:05] <pbramos_> Just making sure I didn't need to do anything else.
[20:24:25] <DaveMethvin> no, thanks a lot for rebasing!
[20:25:02] <pbramos_> no prob!
[20:26:41] <gibson042> yeah, big thanks pbramos_
[20:26:58] <DaveMethvin> ok lemme land that
[20:28:35] <pbramos_> I was going to look at http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12044 next unless you guys had any issues in mind that need attention and no one's claimed
[20:29:15] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg didn't seem to think it was needed; i'm neutral on it pbramos_
[20:29:27] <DaveMethvin> lemme see what else is around
[20:29:36] <DaveMethvin> actually let me get a test rolling before that
[20:29:39] <pbramos_> Ahh I didn't notice he had commented
[20:31:20] <DaveMethvin> oh how the heck did that get in
[20:31:32] <DaveMethvin> i have a prob with the previous commit
