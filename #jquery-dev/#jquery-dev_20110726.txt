[06:45:19] <timmywil> I don't think this is true: Note: Attributes are generally strings; however, in IE6/7 .attr() may return a Boolean (e.g. for checked) or a function (e.g. for onclick).
[06:45:22] <timmywil> from attr docs
[06:45:43] <timmywil> it'll always be "checked" or the contents of the onclick function
[06:46:03] <kswedberg> timmywil: was it true before the attr/prop rewrite?
[06:46:11] <timmywil> it was
[06:46:21] <kswedberg> ok. wanna yank it?
[06:46:36] <timmywil> sure
[06:46:46] <kswedberg> cool. thx. while you're in there...
[06:47:02] <timmywil> heh, whatcha got
[06:47:08] <kswedberg> "the docs imply that .attr will work for <input> "type" attributes in browsers other than IE, whereas in fact the jQuery source prohibits this for all browsers (due to the IE bug).
[06:47:08] <kswedberg> The documentation should state more clearly that this attribute _may not_ be modified, in any browser."
[06:47:35] <kswedberg> a little rephrasing would help there.
[06:47:42] <timmywil> hmm ok
[06:48:33] <kswedberg> thx. :)
[06:48:55] <timmywil> np
[07:21:01] <louisremi> Here is my patch for ?docs #9381 Couldn't make it shorter, but I still don't like it when bug fixes are more than one or two loc https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/446/files
[07:21:03] <bot-t> [#9381] animations halt when the browser is out of focus due to requestAnimationFrame (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9381
[07:41:54] <DaveMethvin> louisremi: still, that's not a lot of code
[07:42:02] <DaveMethvin> for what it fixes
[07:44:25] <louisremi> DaveMethvin: When I patch jQuery, I'm always anxious someone will come and punch me in the face saying "You added 50B to my favorite library for something I'll probably never need, I hate you!"
[07:45:20] <DaveMethvin> haha, yeah i am hoping to do something with the 1.7 event rewrite that is unheard of -- make the code SMALLER!
[07:45:37] <DaveMethvin> but i am sure i will break something and get punched in the face, metaphorically
[07:47:07] <ajpiano> I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHORS OF JQUERY WOULD [...]
[07:47:08] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I'll punch you in the face, literally, if that makes you feel better. :)
[07:47:28] <DaveMethvin> that kswedberg, always ready to help out a buddy :)
[07:47:48] <kswedberg> you can count on me!
[07:48:10] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: ... BE SUCH AN AWESOME BUNCH OF GUYS
[07:48:25] <DaveMethvin> sorry to hear about your ipad
[07:50:55] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: it's ok, i got a new one
[07:51:06] <ajpiano> and i got a military grade impact resistant cover for it
[07:51:13] <DaveMethvin> well good for you mr moneybags!
[07:51:23] <ajpiano> apple replaced it under applecare !!
[07:51:38] <DaveMethvin> my son cracked the screen on his macbook, and they replaced it even though it was out of warranty ... free!
[07:51:46] <DaveMethvin> those guys know how to treat customers
[07:56:10] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: yeah, for real.  i think they realise that having someone who'll spend another $10,000 over the next 5 years is better than $300 today.
[08:15:40] <timmywil> louisremi: time for you to rewrite effects :)
[08:18:15] <louisremi> timmywil: I'm fine with its current state, thank you :-)
[08:18:49] <timmywil> lol
[08:54:41] <rwaldron> So...
[08:55:02] <rwaldron> I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT THE [USERS] OF JQUERY WOULD [...]
[08:55:48] <rwaldron> clone DOM elements and then try to remove the `id` attribute twice
[08:55:52] <rwaldron> why?
[08:56:21] <rwaldron> we're going to rabbit hole jsut because someone can't check if the attr exists first
[08:57:12] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[08:58:53] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: that the repro...not sure what the original did
[08:59:11] <rwaldron> did you see what the latest comment says?
[08:59:18] <rwaldron> they described the behavior
[08:59:21] <DaveMethvin> oh, lemme look
[08:59:31] <rwaldron> "On second time around Internet Explorer 7 only gets to "alert class removed" and then crashes."
[09:00:24] <rwaldron> Didn't we decide we weren't going to add new code to satisfy IE6,7,8 edge cases anymore?
[09:01:09] <rwaldron> if we add a check, like... if ( this elem has ths attr ) { remove } else { don't do that }
[09:01:19] <rwaldron> the other browsers will suffer the performance hit
[09:01:26] <jaubourg> what the flying fuck?
[09:01:40] <jaubourg> <= pissed
[09:01:42] <DaveMethvin> well in the general case you'd need to remove the id attr
[09:01:43] <jaubourg> and hi there
[09:01:45] <DaveMethvin> sup jaubourg
[09:01:55] <DaveMethvin> why so blue?
[09:01:58] <jaubourg> about to fly to Chrome and FF's headquarters with a gun
[09:02:24] <jaubourg> seriously, can they be that unaware of what developping for the web entails?
[09:02:40] <jaubourg> and hi Dave :)
[09:02:49] <DaveMethvin> ok, let it all out jaubourg
[09:02:58] <DaveMethvin> then rwaldron and i will vent
[09:03:18] <jaubourg> ok, here goes: damn fucking timeouts being delayed no matter if they do rendering or not
[09:03:22] <jaubourg> WHAT THE FUCK?
[09:03:27] <rwaldron> oh shit.
[09:03:27] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[09:03:29] <jaubourg> here, done
[09:03:51] <rwaldron> as in, setTimeout has adopted the behaviour of requestAnimationFrame?
[09:04:00] <DaveMethvin> time is s l o w i n g    d    o   w   n
[09:04:06] <rwaldron> oh no
[09:04:16] <rwaldron> so, not at all what i said
[09:04:19] <rwaldron> but worse
[09:04:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah louisremi said it fires every second, max when the tab is out of focus
[09:04:47] <jaubourg> what kind of a moron came up with this idea?
[09:04:57] <DaveMethvin> a slow one?
[09:05:24] <DaveMethvin> it's not actually a bad idea, but too much code depends on setTimeout/setInterval to be close to clock time
[09:05:29] <rwaldron> ok, sorry, can you clarify...
[09:05:36] <rwaldron> when the window has lost focus...
[09:05:50] <rwaldron> setTimeout and now slowing down it's cycles?
[09:05:54] <rwaldron> is*
[09:06:04] <DaveMethvin> http://jsfiddle.net/dmethvin/LvE5R/
[09:06:08] <jaubourg> rwaldron: setTimeout( fn, delay ) => fn fired whenever the browser pleases
[09:06:21] <DaveMethvin> go to that fiddle and watch the third number, the diff
[09:06:28] <DaveMethvin> then click to another tab for a few secs
[09:06:37] <DaveMethvin> "where does the time go" lol
[09:07:13] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: and it is not a bad idea IF it is optional and necessitates explicit asking from the code
[09:07:32] <jaubourg> like raf
[09:07:33] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: but i am sure they wanted to reduce the load of non-visible tabs by default
[09:07:43] <DaveMethvin> because people are lazy and ignorant
[09:07:44] <jaubourg> yeah, they want to look good in the task manager
[09:07:57] <DaveMethvin> it's better to look good than to work good
[09:08:03] <jaubourg> seems so
[09:08:17] <DaveMethvin> but anyway, that really hoses up a LOT of code I agree
[09:08:25] <DaveMethvin> including ours
[09:08:37] <louisremi> jaubourg: browser vendors are trying to get their software to use less battery on your computer, and they don't won't to ask permission to every Web dev out there.
[09:08:40] <jaubourg> well, say hi to java applets to handle timeouts flourishing again
[09:09:03] <DaveMethvin> no, i think ppl need to UNDERSTAND how this works and write code that works with it
[09:09:07] <louisremi> firing setInterval less often in inactive tab is an efficient way to achieve that
[09:09:16] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: +1
[09:09:16] <DaveMethvin> if you need to know clock time differences, look at the clock time
[09:09:33] <jaubourg> web dev will become an impossible mess
[09:10:19] <DaveMethvin> the unfortunate thing is that, once again, jQuery is between the developer and these browser apis that have changed their semantics
[09:10:22] <louisremi> oh come on, it's not that an insurmountable problem... is it?
[09:10:26] <DaveMethvin> so guess who gets blamed!
[09:10:40] <jaubourg> louiremi: you're kiding right?
[09:10:44] <DaveMethvin> i think it's quite surmountable
[09:10:53] <DaveMethvin> if people understand what is happening
[09:11:01] <jaubourg> it's completely breaking existing pages, whether they use jQuery or not
[09:11:06] <rwaldron> I'll be right back
[09:11:29] <DaveMethvin> that's the good news, it's not our fault :P
[09:11:39] <DaveMethvin> although we do get the blame no doubt :(
[09:11:41] <louisremi> I'm using a browser that has this behavior implemented for quite some time now, and the Web is still usable
[09:12:06] <jaubourg> yes, I'm sure that's the argument floating around: "look, it works anyway"
[09:12:21] <DaveMethvin> I am 100% for the rAF and slower setTimeout changes given what they are trying to achieve
[09:12:35] <jaubourg> I'm not
[09:12:38] <DaveMethvin> but i understand that some assumptions are broken now
[09:12:44] <louisremi> yes
[09:12:48] <jaubourg> raf makes sense
[09:12:49] <DaveMethvin> so we need to review our own code to make sure we don
[09:12:54] <DaveMethvin> t make those asumpptions
[09:12:58] <jaubourg> delaying setTimeout is a monstruosity
[09:13:10] <DaveMethvin> it was never a hard-real-time guarantee
[09:13:36] <jaubourg> of course not, but it was not "delay by 20ms and get it done 1000ms later"
[09:13:57] <DaveMethvin> so maybe we should name it setProcrastinate()
[09:14:03] <jaubourg> lol
[09:14:04] <louisremi> :-D
[09:14:36] <jaubourg> to me, delaying timers makes as much sense as pausing audio when tab is not focussed
[09:14:42] <DaveMethvin> actually it is suprising how *little* breaks when you think about it
[09:14:47] <jaubourg> not rendering, I soooo get it
[09:15:02] <DaveMethvin> rendering to an unseen canvas
[09:15:43] <DaveMethvin> if you render a picture of a tree falling in a forest on a tab that isn't invisible, does anyone see it?
[09:15:52] <DaveMethvin> or something like that
[09:16:12] <jaubourg> yeah, I have NO problem with raf not being fired
[09:16:13] <jaubourg> at all
[09:17:13] <DaveMethvin> In the case of .delay() I suspect we need to document that the delay is the minimum ... and create a Reusable in Wordpress that says "timers may be delayed significantly in tabs that are not visible"
[09:18:40] <jaubourg> I really dunno why we're pushing for stuff like HTML5 with all this marketing around and then silently neuter js and make it even more unreliable than it already is
[09:18:51] <jaubourg> I just don't get it
[09:19:30] <jaubourg> I'd love to see an heavy-client framework that does that
[09:19:35] <DaveMethvin> it *is* really useful to slow down or even stop stuff that isn't visible, especially on mobile devices
[09:19:45] <DaveMethvin> i agree it would be good to have some sort of overrides
[09:19:46] <jaubourg> "visible" as in rendering
[09:19:56] <DaveMethvin> someone came in a coupla days ago with a good example
[09:19:57] <jaubourg> what about polling a source in ajax?
[09:20:00] <DaveMethvin> a poker game
[09:20:18] <DaveMethvin> it was using comet and doing a bunch of stuff in the background
[09:20:36] <DaveMethvin> so the user could keep the tab out of focus until a sound told them it was a new deal for example
[09:20:44] <DaveMethvin> and for that you'd want full-speed timers etc
[09:20:57] <jaubourg> exactly
[09:21:18] <jaubourg> anyway, I vented enough
[09:21:23] <jaubourg> thanks for the ears guys
[09:21:33] <DaveMethvin> but those are the exceptions, if there was a setRealTimers or something that would be good
[09:21:33] <jaubourg> and sorry to have shouted at you all ;)
[09:21:48] <DaveMethvin> get off my lawn!
[09:21:51] <jaubourg> :P
[09:22:28] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron and i were looking at docs#9905
[09:22:33] <bot-t> [#9905]  (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9905
[09:23:03] <DaveMethvin> wtf is up with that one? and should we care?
[09:23:40] <jaubourg> id should be removed before cloning
[09:23:43] <jaubourg> shouldn't it?
[09:24:06] <jaubourg> wait, doesn't make sense what i'm saying
[09:24:19] <jaubourg> clone should remove id
[09:24:21] <DaveMethvin> since the clones aren't attached i think it's fine to remove after
[09:24:28] <DaveMethvin> clone never has tho
[09:24:34] <jaubourg> yes, I know
[09:24:52] <DaveMethvin> plus you might clone and remove the original before reinserting the clone
[09:25:00] <jaubourg> I hear you, of course
[09:25:04] <DaveMethvin> or something equally bizarre :)
[09:25:09] <jaubourg> but seems like IE7 is acting all IE on us
[09:25:44] <DaveMethvin> that is such a lonely code path, nobody but ie goes down it
[09:26:14] <jaubourg> dang, gotta fly and have dinner with friends
[09:26:27] <jaubourg> is there a workaround?
[09:26:34] <DaveMethvin> not  yet
[09:27:01] <DaveMethvin> cya later jaubourg, we'll setTimeout(1000) and see you in a few hours
[09:27:07] <jaubourg> hahahaha
[09:27:19] <jaubourg> you own Dave and always know how to cheer me up ;)
[09:27:29] <jaubourg> bbl :)
[09:31:08] <rwaldron> Back
[09:31:21] <rwaldron> so, basically, I say eff this ticket
[09:31:23] <rwaldron> 9905
[09:31:46] <rwaldron> For the reason I said above
[09:32:24] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: it's definitely a pain
[09:33:01] <rwaldron> For me, it's like... if I came across this issue during development
[09:33:16] <rwaldron> I would simply check if the attr existed before blindly trying to remove it
[09:33:17] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: so what level of heroics do you think docs#9905 deserves?
[09:33:19] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, [#9905]  (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9905
[09:33:19] <rwaldron> and move on
[09:33:35] <rwaldron> then again, I thin i ahve a stellar bug filing history
[09:33:39] <DaveMethvin> the thing about clone() is that we already send it through a very different path
[09:33:48] <rwaldron> I think I have*
[09:33:53] <rwaldron> rght
[09:34:02] <DaveMethvin> with at least 2 special non-standard IE apis to shake off the events but copy over attribute
[09:34:03] <rwaldron> we're _already_ making excuses for it's behaviour
[09:34:32] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: think of it like a puppy peeing on the rug
[09:34:33] <rwaldron> "Sorry, IE's cloneNode() got drunk at the family reunion and we had to leave out the back door"
[09:34:36] <rwaldron> intervention time.
[09:35:13] <DaveMethvin> this is just a really bad outcome, not just breakage
[09:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: not sure, do we know what changed in 1.6 that causes the problem?
[09:35:35] <DaveMethvin> oh i missed that
[09:35:42] <rwaldron> attributes changed a lot
[09:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> oh, also, there's a fix
[09:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7538#comment:4
[09:36:20] <rwaldron> "This exists in 1.6.x and master and seems to only affect IE 7 (even IE 6 is fine)." when i read that, i thought you were simply confirming that it was current
[09:36:28] <rwaldron> i didnt realize you mean "regression"
[09:36:35] <rwaldron> that kind of changes things
[09:37:08] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, probably should've made that more clear
[09:37:13] <DaveMethvin> well shoot that looks easy
[09:37:14] <DaveMethvin> now!
[09:37:23] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7538
[09:37:24] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez no problem
[09:37:32] <rwaldron> thanks for clarifying here
[09:37:38] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i think i need better reading comprehension
[09:38:06] <rwaldron> hm
[09:38:20] <scott_gonzalez> sorry, I was kinda going insane when I was tracking down the bug
[09:38:26] <rwaldron> why would ( '' + name ).toUpperCase() === 'ID' be the solution?
[09:38:32] <DaveMethvin> why, it seems so logical? :P
[09:38:33] <scott_gonzalez> I kept thinking "there's no way this is the problem" and then it was
[09:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> or I'd think "obviously the problem comes from this line" and then it wouldn't
[09:38:50] <rwaldron> is it because removeAttributeNode is dumb?
[09:38:57] <DaveMethvin> never overestimate IE
[09:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't even dig into the proposed solution
[09:39:18] <rwaldron> that would branch the logic away from removeAttributeNode
[09:39:30] <DaveMethvin> the workaround the ie ticket can be done in removeAttr, yeah
[09:39:30] <rwaldron> i have an idea...
[09:39:53] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i think i can fix this relatively painlessly for everyone else
[10:10:56] <timmywil> hi all
[10:12:21] <timmywil> so scott_gonzalez: you think elem.removeAttributeNode( elem.getAttributeNode('id') ) on cloned nodes is causing the crash?
[10:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> not sure what's causing it, but it's even stranger that it happens on the second clone
[10:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> the first .clone().removeAttr( "id" ) works fine
[10:14:51] <timmywil> yea that's weird
[10:15:08] <timmywil> would make sense that removeAttribute('id') would be fine tho cause that doesn't do anything
