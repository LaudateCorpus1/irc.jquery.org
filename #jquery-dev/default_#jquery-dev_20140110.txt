[06:17:18] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: you can do `npm update`
[06:17:38] <m_gol> but I have no idea what can be done on swarm
[06:17:44] <m_gol> with regards to that
[06:18:24] <DaveMethvin> gnarf you around?
[06:18:31] <gnarf> DaveMethvin sup
[06:18:46] <DaveMethvin> we need to update the npm setup on swarm for core, i can't recall how it's done
[06:19:00] <DaveMethvin> it's caching the old one
[06:19:09] <gnarf> on jenkins
[06:19:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:19:28] <gnarf> its doing npm install right now
[06:19:37] <gnarf> is install not enough does it also need update?
[06:19:44] <DaveMethvin> it must
[06:20:18] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't seem to have the sinon stuff
[06:20:19] <gnarf> though i don't jnow
[06:20:23] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/1t430e1H2Y38
[06:20:30] <gnarf> it does a git clean -dffx; npm install right now
[06:21:32] <gnarf> sinon isn't in package.json?
[06:22:36] <DaveMethvin> it's in bower
[06:22:48] <gnarf> ok
[06:22:54] <gnarf> so the script doesn't see to bower install
[06:22:57] <gnarf> just npm install
[06:23:01] <gnarf> maybe thats the problem?
[06:23:21] <DaveMethvin> must be.. i recall this happening when we landed sinon in master but i just realized last night it never got over to 1.x
[06:26:17] <m_gol> doesn't npm install also install bower deps?
[06:26:23] <m_gol> I forgot what we currently have
[06:26:27] <DaveMethvin> it seems to locally?
[06:26:34] <DaveMethvin> i never manually bower install anything
[06:26:59] <DaveMethvin> but there may be some plumbing process i'm not understanding
[06:29:26] <m_gol> `npm build` does `npm install && grunt`
[06:29:47] <DaveMethvin> let me look at the irc logs, i think it was discussed when this landed in master
[06:31:15] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: btw, does `npm build` even work on windows?
[06:31:22] <m_gol> i.e. does `&&` in npm scripts work on windows?
[06:31:31] <m_gol> because if not then we seriously overlooked it
[06:31:36] <DaveMethvin> it does when you have bash installed
[06:31:45] <m_gol> only?
[06:31:48] <DaveMethvin> all works fine here
[06:31:49] <m_gol> oh, that's bad :(
[06:32:05] <DaveMethvin> i haven't tried the native command line but i don't think we support it
[06:32:12] <m_gol> hm, ok
[06:32:38] <m_gol> but we don't mention bash in readme
[06:32:44] <m_gol> so Windows users can try cmd
[06:33:01] <DaveMethvin> we mention using msysgit
[06:33:04] <DaveMethvin> which has bash
[06:33:27] <m_gol> ah, right
[06:33:31] <m_gol> not msysgit but git-bash
[06:33:34] <m_gol> but it works there as well
[06:33:35] <DaveMethvin> those instuctions used to work at least, i actually tested them out last time i set up a system
[06:33:48] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/#what-you-need-to-build-your-own-jquery
[06:34:31] <m_gol> though I'm not sure if "install git" with a link is clear enough that the user should use git-bash
[06:34:37] <m_gol> after all, git works from cmd as well
[06:35:03] <DaveMethvin> i had probs getting it to run from cmd in the past
[06:38:49] <m_gol> so maybe we should put that in clear that `Git Bash` should be used on Windows
[06:38:51] <m_gol> in README
[06:39:22] <DaveMethvin> well right now i'd settle for tests running right on jenkins
[06:39:27] <DaveMethvin> i don't see what's wrong
[06:39:32] <m_gol> or maybe people do it intuitively because cmd is so crappy :D
[06:39:36] <DaveMethvin> i just did a clean setup
[06:39:40] <DaveMethvin> npm install works locally
[06:40:01] <DaveMethvin> here let me create a new dir
[06:41:17] <DaveMethvin> i remembered wrong i think about landing sinon on master http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-dev/default_%23jquery-dev_20131124.log.html
[06:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> If we would just commit our bower dependencies we'd never have these problems ;-)
[06:42:19] <DaveMethvin> well i am mainly wondering what's different that makes it break
[06:42:53] <DaveMethvin> committing all files including temps from my own dir would fix it
[06:43:02] <DaveMethvin> since it works locally
[06:43:12] <m_gol> npm cache clean?
[06:44:12] <DaveMethvin> if that needs to be done on jenkins, then gnarf or someone with access to the box would have to do it, unless we want to make it part of our standard build process in which case i can add it to the job
[06:44:24] <gnarf> m_gol: git clean -dffx
[06:45:39] <gnarf> that deletes everything not committed
[06:45:44] <gnarf> first step of the build
[06:46:07] <m_gol> gnarf: are there exact commands available somewhere too look?
[06:46:29] <DaveMethvin> the jenkins job has the list
[06:46:31] <m_gol> I mean what commands exactly are done on Jenkins (except some sensitive stuff)
[06:47:08] <DaveMethvin> yay, i reproed it with a bare build
[06:47:15] <m_gol> :)
[06:47:26] <DaveMethvin> now i just have to figure out why
[06:47:34] <gnarf> m_gol: looking at the log in jenkins will tell you every command run
[06:47:50] <gnarf> m_gol: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201.x/341/console
[06:48:00] <gnarf> http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201.x/341/consoleFull
[06:50:06] <DaveMethvin> ARRRRGH
[06:50:19] <DaveMethvin> when did the name change from bower_modules to bower_components
[06:50:37] <DaveMethvin> this requires another cup of coffee
[06:50:48] <m_gol> maybe with timmywil's bowercopy addition?
[06:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> I've gotta admit, this is definitely easier than when we manually copied two or three files every few months...
[06:56:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that message needs cartoon fight scene noises
[06:56:22] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[06:57:18] <DaveMethvin> this has gotten really complicated
[07:00:14] <DaveMethvin> i don't see when bowercopy runs or how it's triggered
[07:01:21] <gnarf> grunt ?
[07:01:38] <DaveMethvin> the task is there, i just don't see when it is called
[07:02:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but it's just these three files!? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L63-L65 :)
[07:02:57] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: confirm
[07:04:03] <DaveMethvin> my normal "working" jquery dir doesn't have bower_components, and it works fine
[07:04:12] <DaveMethvin> but i think that's because the files were already copied
[07:04:18] <m_gol> ha
[07:04:20] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: try a fresh clone
[07:04:24] <m_gol> maybe it isn't run?
[07:04:29] <DaveMethvin> i did, that's how i broke it!
[07:04:39] <gnarf> right
[07:04:39] <DaveMethvin> git clone, npm install
[07:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't anyone tell the core team not to play with voodoo?
[07:04:54] <gnarf> so we also need grunt bowercopy 
[07:04:55] <gnarf> ?
[07:05:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah?
[07:05:05] <gnarf> stick that in the "default" ?
[07:05:11] <DaveMethvin> but it seems strange to have that as a manual step
[07:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> CONFIRM
[07:05:19] <DaveMethvin> and i suspect it only has to happen after the clone/install
[07:05:32] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: No, it's even better than that.
[07:05:32] <gnarf> agree
[07:05:33] <DaveMethvin> so i guess that's why it's not in the default
[07:05:38] <scott_gonzalez> It has to happen whenever the dependencies update.
[07:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> And you'll never know when that is :-)
[07:05:59] <DaveMethvin> well they are deps, so that kinda makes sense
[07:06:13] <gnarf> but now you just have to run it from time to time
[07:06:32] <DaveMethvin> but it doesn't work right at all for jenkins or even for users, we didn't mention this in the readme did we?
[07:06:35] <gnarf> i think it has to be "default"
[07:07:10] <m_gol> either default or `npm build` should evaluate to `npm install && grunt bowercopy && grunt`
[07:07:12] <gnarf> with an incremental build system, it wouldn't matter ;)
[07:07:22] <DaveMethvin> ugh, if it's default then it will happen every time we build
[07:07:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah gnarf, we shoudl get one of those :)
[07:07:34] <m_gol> so maybe just `npm build`
[07:07:42] <m_gol> though then we can sometimes miss it ;)
[07:07:54] <gnarf> so
[07:07:55] <gnarf> like
[07:08:03] <gnarf> bowercopy doesn't waste time copying every time does it?
[07:08:09] <m_gol> but in the same way as we can miss npm dependencies in proper versions
[07:08:19] <gnarf> or does it bower install too
[07:08:22] <gnarf> oh yeah
[07:08:37] <m_gol> I need to add this: https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-check-dependencies to the repo
[07:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> Guys, this is much less painful than you think.
[07:09:07] <m_gol> and maybe sth similar for bower
[07:09:26] <scott_gonzalez> Please go read this commit message: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/f9ad13c9ec8967916427642db2883a1bf3bccd86
[07:09:54] <DaveMethvin> OH
[07:09:57] <m_gol> ahh
[07:10:01] <DaveMethvin> ok
[07:10:03] <m_gol> right
[07:10:04] <gnarf> hah
[07:10:31] <gnarf> so we are still just manually copying three files around?
[07:10:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez?
[07:10:42] <scott_gonzalez> Sort of.
[07:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> We're using bower to avoid the manual getting of the files.
[07:11:17] <DaveMethvin> the problem with these sort of things they don't happen often enough to be burned into memory
[07:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> But bower gives us more files than we care about. And puts files in a place we don't want them.
[07:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> Bowercopy gets us back to the same result as manual.
[07:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> And committing gets us back to sanity.
[07:11:42] <DaveMethvin> right
[07:12:27] <gnarf> but sinon!? :)
[07:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> The manual process was obvious, had the same results, and based on history up to now was faster ;-)
[07:13:46] <m_gol> it would be simpler if this commit message was put in the comment near the bower task definition in Gruntfile
[07:13:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:13:59] <DaveMethvin> also, it doesn't seem to be working for me
[07:14:04] <m_gol> no one reads commit messages from the past unless looking for sth specific
[07:14:10] <DaveMethvin> it's not pulling in sinon
[07:14:18] <DaveMethvin> oh maybe missing in the gf
[07:15:05] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L65
[07:15:17] <m_gol> this is the only place
[07:15:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah, missing in the 1.x gf
[07:16:11] <DaveMethvin> but why didn't my cherry-pick get that?

[11:02:30] <eddiemonge> are license changes retroactive?
[11:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> No, that's impossible.
[11:04:18] <eddiemonge> i cant really find info on older versions that were dual licensed
[11:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> What information are you trying to find?
[11:05:01] <eddiemonge> the dual licensed versions. am i free to decide which license to use or are there specific requirements
[11:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> You pick which license you want.
[11:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> Which is honestly the same as today.
[11:06:32] <eddiemonge> just making sure because there is a business requirement to not use gpl'ed software thats being enforced now
[11:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery has been MIT since April 21, 2006
[11:09:10] <scott_gonzalez> So you're safe.
[11:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> From March 1 to April 26 it was CC-BY-SA :-P
[11:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, March 21
[11:14:42] <eddiemonge> licensing is so confusing
[11:15:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[11:15:28] <DaveMethvin> eddiemonge: it sounds like your company wants you to "prove this software is SAFE to use" which cannot be done
[11:15:40] <eddiemonge> why cant it be: use my code for whatever, give me credit when you use my code, or pay me when you use my code.
[11:15:51] <DaveMethvin> no matter the license, there is no firm guarantee that it doesn't contain proprietary information
[11:15:51] <eddiemonge> DaveMethvin: pretty much. hello IBM
[11:16:05] <scott_gonzalez> MIT is basically that simple.
[11:16:15] <scott_gonzalez> It says do what you want, keep this license available.
[11:16:16] <DaveMethvin> the way you find that out is that time goes by without anyone suing you, or if they do sue and they lose
[11:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't sound like the situation to me.
[11:16:50] <scott_gonzalez> They're not looking for safe code (GPL is no more or less safe than MIT or any other license).
[11:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> GPL is viral though.
[11:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> They're taking the legally safe road of avoiding the virality debate.
[11:17:33] <scott_gonzalez> There are no court rulings about whether linking applies JavaScript.
[11:18:07] <scott_gonzalez> *applies to*
[11:18:14] <DaveMethvin> they think they're avoiding virality, which if they are lucky they are
[11:18:33] <DaveMethvin> unless someone copy/pasted some gpl code into an mit project
[11:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that alone wouldn't make the MIT code viral.
[11:19:00] <eddiemonge> which i just found in a npm project
[11:19:11] <DaveMethvin> it would just complicate the legal situation
[11:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> The code would need to be non-trivial and also have only been available under GPL.
[11:19:34] <scott_gonzalez> Or other similarly restrictive licenses.
[11:19:48] <DaveMethvin> and then you get lawyers to do the search and pay experts to make the judgements about triviality
[11:20:02] <DaveMethvin> so yeah i understand why they want to avoid gpl
[11:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's very unlikely to ever happen though.
[11:20:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i think most of these issues are about unlikely things myself
[11:20:36] <eddiemonge> the bigger the company the bigger the target though (even if it will be harder to beat them)
[11:21:07] <DaveMethvin> my problem isn't gpl code right now, it's working code :)
[11:21:29] <DaveMethvin> seems like sinon timers aren't very happy with oldIE
[11:22:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm unsure if a company could get sued for using code which was illegally provided under the guise of legal provision.
[11:22:49] <DaveMethvin> isn't that how patent claims are being done by trolls? don't attack the maker but instead the little guy running it on their site
[11:23:20] <DaveMethvin> so big companies are offering idemnity and saying they'll protect their customers against those claims
[11:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> Patents and copyrights have different rules.
[11:24:00] <scott_gonzalez> You can't unknowingly create a copyright infringement from scratch.
[11:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> You can unknowingly create a patent infringement from scratch.
[11:24:31] <DaveMethvin> whatever
[11:24:36] <scott_gonzalez> Copyright infringement requires explicit copying.
[11:25:01] <scott_gonzalez> And I'm not sure if the third party that is using the infringed code can be held liable.
[11:25:11] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be a question for the legal experts.
[11:25:29] <DaveMethvin> as is most of this stuff that never happens very often
[11:29:14] <DaveMethvin> browserstack needs an onbeforeunload that prevents you from losing a 15-minute debugging session
[11:32:42] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We seemed to have consensus to change the Travis output. Should I go ahead and do that for all of our projects using Travis?
[11:33:04] <DaveMethvin> sounds good to me scott_gonzalez 
[11:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...jQuery Mobile may be the only project using IRC notifications right now.
[11:36:14] <scott_gonzalez> Should I add it for the other projects using Travis?
[11:36:55] <DaveMethvin> it would be good if we could reduce the noise, like maybe not announce the pr being opened and let travis tell us
[11:37:38] <scott_gonzalez> So you want me to disable PR notifications and enable Travis notifications?
[11:37:56] <DaveMethvin> does that seem reasonable?
[11:38:12] <DaveMethvin> we'll get a travis on every push to a pr as well, right?
[11:38:52] <DaveMethvin> at some point this is like email sound notifications, which i turn off so i can concentrate
[11:40:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should get a Travis notification on every push to a PR.
[11:40:43] <scott_gonzalez> So what we'd be losing would be when a PR is closed, but that doesn't seem too important to have in IRC.
[11:41:13] <DaveMethvin> when it's closed i get email
[11:41:28] <DaveMethvin> believe me i am not short of notifications, even today
[11:41:30] <DaveMethvin> :)
[11:53:37] <gnarf> travis notifications are noisy
[11:53:45] <gnarf> and the important ones come by email anyway
[11:56:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah a one-line travis would be nice, looks like they're three lines
[12:04:25] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we can make them one line.
[12:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> I use a two line two line notification for DEBT:
[12:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> [travis-ci] Scott GonzÃ¡lez updated the master branch of scottgonzalez/temp-test
[12:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> [travis-ci] The build was broken. http://travis-ci.org/scottgonzalez/temp-test/builds/15323980
[12:05:05] <DaveMethvin> one very LONG line doesn't count either :)
[12:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> It could be "scottgonzalez/temp-test master updated by Scott GonzÃ¡lez. The build was broken. {link}"
[12:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be nice if they had short URLs.
[12:06:40] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[12:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> If they provided the build ID, we could make our own short URLs.
[12:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> But they only provide the full URL.
[12:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, they do provide the build number.
[12:09:44] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure why they stuck that in the middle of the git related data.
[14:11:02] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: how does this command line look?  node release.js --pre-release=2.1.0-rc1 --remote=dmethvin/jquery
[14:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: beautiful
[14:14:20] <DaveMethvin> still have to get the 1.x branch cleaned up ... looks like i may have to back out the sinon timers if i can't get it squared away tonight
[14:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> Back in my day, we had to walk up hill (both ways!) to change the batteries in the room-sized computer just to get setTimeout() to work. And you're complaining about sinon timers!
[14:16:10] <DaveMethvin> it's always oldIE
[14:16:17] <DaveMethvin> and i KNEW it would be oldIE
[14:16:42] <DaveMethvin> but IE8 seems to be a lot better at caching than I am at clearing cache
[14:17:16] <DaveMethvin> and i've been trying to debug it today and every time i get about 5-10 minutes in i get some high prio interrupt and browserstack times me out
[14:17:29] <DaveMethvin> plus the time i refreshed Chrome and blew it away...that one hurt
[14:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> I can't help but think of this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEpsKnWZrJ8
[14:21:58] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: btw how do you update AUTHORS.txt ... just run `grunt authors` and check the end of both lists right?
[14:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[14:22:34] <DaveMethvin> huh, wonder how i screwed that up
[14:22:43] <scott_gonzalez> If they're out of sync, I just copy from the last name in AUTHORS.txt to the last line of grunt output.
[14:22:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah

[14:35:40] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: is there a debug mode? getting an error, prob related to the extra cdn stuff we do http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/0e3fd9.png
[14:35:58] <DaveMethvin> what's the best way to track it down?
[14:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> The output that you see is all the information that's available to us.
[14:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> We could do a console.log() of the command we ran.
[14:43:11] <DaveMethvin> well it seems like the prob must be in repo.js right after it logs that
[14:44:07] <DaveMethvin> my guesss is here: Release.git( "commit -m 'Tagging the " + Release.newVersion + " release.'" 
[14:44:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's not handling the quotes properly.
[14:44:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah, not sure why
[14:44:24] <scott_gonzalez> Is this a stupid Windows thing?
[14:44:38] <scott_gonzalez> Seems odd that this line would be failing.
[14:44:55] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[14:45:09] <DaveMethvin> and my newVersion doesn't have any single quotes in it :)
[14:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go, dinner's ready.
[14:45:16] <DaveMethvin> np i'll figure it out
[14:45:19] <DaveMethvin> running out myself soon
[14:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I'd start by trying to reduce the problem with just using shell.exec()
[15:01:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah, never used the shelljs module, just process.exec
[15:01:48] <DaveMethvin> i just checked the bug tracker for it, there are a couple of windows related bugs but nothing that would seem to be like this
[15:02:04] <DaveMethvin> i can try a test case where we use single quotes as an alternative which would work here as well
