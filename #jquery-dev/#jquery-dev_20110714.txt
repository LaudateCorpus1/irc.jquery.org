[05:39:27] <addyosmani> kswedberg, yt?
[05:39:38] <kswedberg> hey addyosmani
[05:39:45] <addyosmani> heya
[05:40:19] <addyosmani> quick docs question - so if I was documenting something related to $(">elem", context), should I assume http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/ would be the best place for it?
[05:40:52] <addyosmani> or am I way off base? :)
[05:42:17] <kswedberg> yeah. that makes sense. might also make sense to put it in http://api.jquery.com/jquery/#selector-context
[05:43:02] <addyosmani> awesome
[05:43:03] <addyosmani> thank you :)
[05:43:11] <kswedberg> or put it in a "Reusable" and add it as a "Note" custom field for both
[05:43:59] <addyosmani> good idea.
[05:44:23] <addyosmani> Hoping to trim down the docs list a little more.
[05:44:34] <kswedberg> awesome. the needsdocs list?
[05:44:54] <addyosmani> yes yes
[05:44:58] <addyosmani> bbs
[06:13:45] <ndee> when developing a plugin, what's best practice regarding CSS stuff? Should a plugin have a separate css file or is it acceptable to create the styles inline?
[06:13:52] <ndee> oops
[06:13:53] <ndee> sorry
[06:54:33] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: can we talk about this: Note: The $(">elem", context) selector will be deprecated in a future release. It's usage is thus discouraged in lieu of using alternative selectors.
[07:56:52] <JohnResig> sure
[08:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> there are lots of places where selectors that start with > are useful
[08:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> generally when you've got a widget that needs to find elements to control
[08:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> for example in jQuery UI sortable has an items option wichh defaults to "> *"
[08:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> and accordion has a header option which defaults to "> li > :first-child,> :not(li):even"
[08:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> I've seen other plugins outside of UI do the same thing
[08:10:00] <scott_gonzalez> and there are more examples than just those two inside UI
[08:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> I seem to recall Justin saying JMVC does it for event delegation a lot
[10:39:53] <Bubbi> Hey y'all, i was wondering if it was possible to reopen a closed ticket? This one is still going on: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7071
[10:42:08] <ajpiano> Bubbi: unfortunately... http://docs.jquery.com/Won%27t_Fix#SVG.2FXML.2FVML_Bugs
[10:45:02] <Bubbi> ajpiano: fair enough :) I've just had 5 hours of debugging and finally found the culprit in jQuery - It's a rather easy fix, so I would very much like to submit the patch for it.. Just don't know how yet..
[10:45:30] <ajpiano> Bubbi: http://weblog.bocoup.com/javascript-jquery-bug-fixing-guide
[10:45:51] <ajpiano> if you actually are able to come up with a pull request against this ticket
[10:45:59] <ajpiano> i will reopen the ticket for you, just ping me
[10:47:31] <Bubbi> ajpiano: Yeah.. hah, i have no clue what that page says :-D
[10:48:15] <Bubbi> I haven't worked that much with git and such
[10:49:04] <Bubbi> ajpiano: If you have the time, it's a one line "fix her up" kindda thing
[10:49:31] <ajpiano> you'd also have to write tests etcc
[10:49:55] <ajpiano> this would be a good opportunity for you to learn the git stuff :)
[10:51:00] <Bubbi> ajpiano: Heh yeah that's true :-) I'll just take a look and see if I can figure it out.. :)
[11:52:09] <plukevdh> hey, real quick, how do i run the ajax unit test suite?
[12:01:39] <scott_gonzalez> plukevdh: you need a web server, like Apache
[12:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> and then you run it just like any other test suite
[12:13:03] <jzaefferer> would be nice to get rid of the PHP dependency though
