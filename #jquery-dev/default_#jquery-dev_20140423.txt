[01:26:47] <brunoais> hey
[01:26:54] <brunoais> where do I file bugs in the documentation?
[01:46:48] <brunoais> hey
[01:46:49] <brunoais> where do I file bugs in the documentation?
[01:47:17] <brunoais> chriys, do you know?
[01:47:35] <chriys> Hi all
[01:48:05] <chriys> No sorry
[01:56:12] <brunoais> ok
[01:56:15] <brunoais> thanks anyway
[02:22:01] <m_gol> brunoais: code for documentation on specific sites is all on github, e.g. for api.jquery.com it's github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com
[02:22:25] <m_gol> brunoais: that's also where you should report potential bugs in the documentation
[02:22:37] <brunoais> m_gol, ok, thanks
[07:10:01] <brunoais> hey again
[07:10:15] <brunoais> (I forgot about this:) in the documentation there's this:
[07:10:22] <brunoais> "As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the DOM tree"
[07:10:24] <brunoais> and this
[07:10:34] <brunoais> "To trigger handlers bound via jQuery without also triggering the native event,"
[07:10:45] <brunoais> both are in this page:
[07:10:50] <brunoais> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[07:10:59] <brunoais> are both wrong?
[07:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> brunoais: Neither is wrong. Why would you think they are?
[07:24:38] <brunoais> scott_gonzalez, really?
[07:24:43] <brunoais> interesting....
[07:24:54] <brunoais> I may be outdated, though
[07:25:02] <brunoais> I's been a while since I last read jQuery's code
[07:25:06] <scott_gonzalez> If you're outdated, it's by several years.
[07:25:27] <brunoais> IIRC, for the 1st way it was using innerHTML
[07:25:34] <brunoais> the other way it uses createNode
[07:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> What does innerHTML have to do with triggering events?
[07:25:54] <scott_gonzalez> I think you're very confused about what's happening.
[07:26:06] <brunoais> it has to do with working with the DOM or with a hack that IE made years ago that ppl abuse ;)
[07:26:12] <brunoais> innerHTML is very broken
[07:26:21] <brunoais> it has a lot of gotchas
[07:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> What does that have to do with events?
[07:28:33] <brunoais> ups
[07:28:41] <brunoais> wrong channel, sorry scott_gonzalez 
[07:28:57] <brunoais> I was in 4 channels at the same time and I went the wrong way
[07:29:01] <brunoais> sorry
[07:29:13] <brunoais> ok, back on track
[07:29:25] <brunoais>  <scott_gonzalez> brunoais: Neither is wrong. Why would you think they are? <- they are wrong
[07:29:38] <brunoais> well
[07:29:44] <brunoais> in some situations are
[07:30:14] <brunoais> scott_gonzalez,  http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/bA7MB/
[07:30:18] <brunoais> that, for example
[07:30:37] <brunoais> the change event is not caught by the event listener
[07:31:35] <arschmitz> brunoais: thats exactly what the documentation says should happen
[07:31:49] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: No it's not.
[07:31:59] <arschmitz> brunoais: you pasted it yourself "To trigger handlers bound via jQuery without also triggering the native event"
[07:32:16] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: That sentence is about .triggerHandler().
[07:32:23] <arschmitz> oh sorry
[07:32:26] <brunoais> arschmitz, that's a change proposal given that:
[07:32:53] <brunoais> scott_gonzalez, http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11500
[07:32:58] <brunoais> this was deemed invalid
[07:33:27] <brunoais> I was told on this channel that trigger may not generate a DOM event
[07:33:30] <scott_gonzalez> brunoais: That's because .change() => .trigger( "change" ) => run jQuery's change handlers, then run element.change()
[07:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> Correct.
[07:33:48] <brunoais> well, it's not
[07:34:09] <brunoais> hum...
[07:34:19] <brunoais> element.change()? from the DOM?
[07:34:31] <brunoais> scott_gonzalez, I didn't see that in the source code... 
[07:34:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L338
[07:35:01] <scott_gonzalez> Native .change() does not run change handlers.
[07:37:14] <brunoais> checking...
[07:38:57] <brunoais> scott_gonzalez, there's no native change() event
[07:39:07] <brunoais> I mean
[07:39:10] <brunoais> that was wrong
[07:39:19] <brunoais> there's no native change() method on DOM elements
[07:41:21] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's why you don't get any native behavior.
[07:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery is doing what it's done for years.
[07:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> It's not designed for mixing native events and jQuery events.
[07:41:58] <brunoais> I'm being forced to mix 2 libs T.T
[07:42:06] <brunoais> the dependencies require that
[07:42:21] <scott_gonzalez> Monkey patch it yourself.
[07:42:25] <brunoais> so without the events in the DOM, they don't know how to communicate betwene eachother
[07:42:30] <brunoais> sounds like it, yes
[07:43:00] <brunoais> scott_gonzalez, I've been trying to find docs on how to add funcionality to jQuery's methods
[07:43:07] <brunoais> but I can't seem to be able to find that
[07:43:23] <brunoais> I have no access to change the jquery files that my system use
[07:43:36] <brunoais> but I can use the plugins concept in order to patch it up
[07:43:53] <scott_gonzalez> You shouldn't change the jQuery source directly.
[07:43:57] <scott_gonzalez> You'll have no upgrade path.
[07:44:03] <scott_gonzalez> Just proxy methods and do what you need.
[07:44:06] <brunoais> yeah, my thought too
[07:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> You're now in #jquery territory though.
[07:44:18] <brunoais> Ok
[07:44:24] <brunoais> thanks for the help
[07:44:27] <brunoais> I'll ask there
[07:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
