[17:13:22] <rwaldron> hey DaveMethvin
[17:13:26] <rwaldron> how was your weekend?
[17:13:29] <DaveMethvin> whatcha doin?
[17:13:54] <rwaldron> not much, why whats up?
[17:14:05] <DaveMethvin> i was working on the propHooks stuff of course
[17:14:09] <DaveMethvin> :)
[17:14:16] <rwaldron> nice
[17:14:25] <DaveMethvin> i dunno, been down several dead ends
[17:14:29] <DaveMethvin> you probably visited them too
[17:14:41] <DaveMethvin> lemme get a link to what i have

[17:15:19] <rwaldron> cool
[17:15:20] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by dmethvin (18m, 46s ago): propHooks now an object with `props` array and `filter` function.Use the originalEvent to grab properties in filter functions since they often won't have been copied to event. Mark a few current props in the main jQuery.event.props list as deprecated, they aren't supported across all browsers.
[17:15:32] <DaveMethvin> but there is just NO WAY TO TEST IT!!
[17:16:33] <DaveMethvin> i thought i had a nice unit test but then i tested in ie9 and it doesn't fire
[17:16:45] <rwaldron> that was constantly a problem for me
[17:17:13] <DaveMethvin> oh i know what might work, i could use click for ie and focus for everyone else
[17:17:15] <DaveMethvin> lemme try that
[17:18:04] <rwaldron> while you're in there.
[17:18:10] <rwaldron> "propHook.props?"
[17:18:16] <rwaldron> => "propHook.props ?"
[17:18:43] <rwaldron> i like this
[17:18:48] <rwaldron> structurally anyway
[17:19:06] <rwaldron> hook: { props: [], filter: function() {} }
[17:20:00] <rwaldron> i think the reduction on jQuery.event.props is going to be quite significant for events that dont need that stuff
[17:20:03] <rwaldron> eg. scroll
[17:21:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i came up with a bunch of concerns about the stuf we're copying, i don't know why we bother with ones like srcElement that are IE-only
[17:21:35] <DaveMethvin> but the fact that we can't really test this is a pain
[17:21:42] <DaveMethvin> b/c i am sure we're going to break things
[17:24:20] <rwaldron> things like this...

[17:24:50] <rwaldron> where original.fromElement is referred to 3 times... i think these need to be cached references as freq as possible
[17:25:11] <rwaldron> three property lookups, when it could be one
[17:25:19] <rwaldron> also bytes ;)
[17:26:51] <rwaldron> also...

[17:27:04] <rwaldron> "propHook.filter?" => "propHook.filter ?"
[17:27:55] <DaveMethvin> yep
[17:28:03] <DaveMethvin> my test still doesn't work
[17:40:32] <DaveMethvin> work damn you ie
