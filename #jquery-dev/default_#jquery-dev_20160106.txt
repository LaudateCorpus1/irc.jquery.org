[12:08:57] <zoe_infp> Hi I need to know why it doesn't work https://github.com/Zoeinfp/generateur-de-formulaire.git
[12:12:26] <DaveMethvin> hi zoe_infp, you should ask for help on #jquery

[14:08:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: success ^
[14:08:51] <DaveMethvin> \o/
[14:10:55] <timmywil> there will probably be some failures, but we can handle those separately now

[14:14:53] <jqcommit> 13jquery/061.12-stable 14729c75f 15Timmy Willison: Tests: fix support tests in ie9
[14:15:50] <timmywil> 8 tests failing in ie6? I'll take it.
[14:16:02] <DaveMethvin> that's not bad
[14:17:18] <DaveMethvin> man that's a bizarre offset failure http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/be7f7e.png
[14:17:53] <timmywil> yea, with a failure like that, I'd expect more offset tests to fail
[14:18:07] <DaveMethvin> all the other tests seem to be dimensional issues too?
[14:18:19] <DaveMethvin> width height type issues
[14:26:24] <timmywil> offsetParent is off. Might be this commit: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/96447575c23f7b313091750ed84cec05db3a25c6
[14:29:46] <DaveMethvin> seems like a good suspect
[14:38:01] <timmywil> well, that fixed one test
[14:57:20] <timmywil> oh right, ie6 doesn't support fixed position for injected code
[14:58:18] <timmywil> these new basic tests were using fixed

[16:33:13] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yes. http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1986 Remaining failures look like flukes.
[16:34:58] <timmywil> tested remaining failures manually and they're fine.
[16:36:31] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I believe we are about ready to release these puppies. If you get a chance, could you do a glancing verification?
[16:37:04] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: I won't be able to get to it until tomorrow, is that okay?
[16:37:14] <timmywil> that's fine
[16:37:19] <DaveMethvin> nice work!
[16:37:28] <timmywil> ty!
[16:51:37] <m_gol> timmywil: did you check the periodic run?
[16:52:00] <m_gol> http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryweekly
[16:52:12] <m_gol> they should be fired and Android 2.3 has to be verified manually
[16:52:41] <timmywil> Not sure I have the perms for that
[16:53:26] <m_gol> don't you have jenkins credentials?
[16:54:02] <m_gol> http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201%20Periodic/ & http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%202%20Periodic/
[16:54:09] <m_gol> I can schedule them
[16:54:21] <m_gol> but Android 2.3 will most likely have to be verified manually anyway
[16:55:46] <timmywil> doesn't look like I do
