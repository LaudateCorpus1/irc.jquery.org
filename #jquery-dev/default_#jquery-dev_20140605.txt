[07:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> Sometimes I just want to say "Are you fucking kidding me?"
[07:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> It seems to happen often when jdalton talks...
[07:11:48] <arschmitz> lol
[07:12:01] <scott_gonzalez> Does he really think it's sane for all projects to be doing this? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/540#issuecomment-45223164
[07:23:10] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats not anything "exotic" id hate to see what he thinks is crazy

[14:46:33] <gandalfx> where can I reliably submit a feature request for jQuery core?
[14:49:38] <snover> there is no reliability in open-source software
[14:49:49] <snover> you get what you get whenever someone feels like it :)
[14:50:11] <gandalfx> I guess so xD
[14:50:37] <gandalfx> though some projects have an issue tracker that looks more "inviting" then the jquery bugtracker
[14:50:54] <snover> well, since you know about the bug tracker, i guess i donâ€™t have to link you to it
[14:50:57] <snover> thatâ€™s where they go
[14:51:11] <gandalfx> mh
[14:51:34] <gandalfx> making an account so I can share a single thoughtâ€¦
[14:51:53] <gandalfx> I'd like to suggest an integer argument for .parent(n) that allows you to go up n levels
[14:55:14] <gandalfx> so I learned you can do that with .parents().eq(n)
[14:55:21] <gandalfx> problem solves
[22:30:22] <Krinkle> Okay, I can go to sleep now
