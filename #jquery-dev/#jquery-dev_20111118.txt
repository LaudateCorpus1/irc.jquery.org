[05:02:50] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[05:03:01] <jaubourg> hey Mike
[05:03:11] <jaubourg> had a good night?
[05:03:20] <mikesherov> meh
[05:03:29] <jaubourg> :|
[05:03:37] <jaubourg> well, I didn't sleep yet myself so...
[05:03:46] <mikesherov> Where do you live?
[05:04:38] <mikesherov> what part of the world?
[05:10:19] <jaubourg> brussels, belgium, europe ;)
[05:10:27] <jaubourg> heya Dave
[05:11:00] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg, sup!
[05:11:12] <jaubourg> nm, hanging around with mikesherov ;)
[05:11:21] <jaubourg> you?
[05:11:26] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin, bug in 1.7.1
[05:11:29] <DaveMethvin> pretty good
[05:11:33] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/3d6237ef8aff8a31ace3e956e2700aa11e3da752#commitcomment-729556
[05:11:34] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by timmywil (17h, 23m ago): Remove the invisible body in support; Add temporary tests to verify correct support completions for upcoming support changes.
[05:11:40] <mikesherov> found it using JSHint ;-)
[05:11:50] <DaveMethvin> ut oh, how bad?
[05:12:10] <mikesherov> global body leak
[05:12:16] <mikesherov> submitting PR right now
[05:12:18] <mikesherov> easy fix
[05:12:21] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: mike thinks it may be possible to have jsHint just test for assignments to undeclared vars, which wouldn't be as vocal as current option
[05:12:31] <DaveMethvin> that would be nice
[05:12:35] <jaubourg> heh
[05:13:13] <jaubourg> that would require modification of jsHint though, but I don't see why Anton wouldn't like this one
[05:13:16] <DaveMethvin> and "global body leak"
[05:13:19] <DaveMethvin> yuck
[05:13:27] <jaubourg> window.body = null
[05:13:29] <jaubourg> ouch
[05:13:40] <mikesherov> JSHint to the rescue
[05:13:46] <DaveMethvin> all i really want is to find variables i haven't declared
[05:13:53] <jaubourg> yep, same here
[05:14:11] <jaubourg> the ordering stuff is overkill and wrong (mostly because the parser assumes too much)
[05:14:15] <jaubourg> (or too little)
[05:14:29] <mikesherov> well, not "wrong", just a bit more cumbresome
[05:14:36] <mikesherov> actually leads to a smaller uglify though
[05:15:24] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/607
[05:15:25] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (11.616s ago): don't leak "body" to global, fixes #10826
[05:15:52] <jaubourg> yeah, well, when we get to gain size by re-ordering, we'll get to it... I'd love it if jsHint tests didn't require so much rewrite for something we actually don't really want to test for
[05:16:10] <jaubourg> but heh, I'm just repeating myself
[05:16:19] <jaubourg> forgive the old french
[05:16:25] <mikesherov> yeah, we can argue about it all day
[05:16:50] <mikesherov> for now, I think we'll need to eat that cost, but that's two bugs it's caught in 3 weeks.
[05:16:59] <mikesherov> but = because*
[05:17:42] <jaubourg> no, I think we should try and get the "assigning to non-declared var" in jsHint, not eat that cost
[05:18:33] <jaubourg> that's what's been caught, the other stuff tested by jsHint was wrongly flagged as incorrect
[05:18:47] <DaveMethvin> so jaubourg what is your take on docs#10824?
[05:18:48] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, Luma Pictures Seeking Web Developer - http://www.fxguide.com/forums/showthread.php?10824-Luma-Pictures-Seeking-Web-Developer
[05:18:52] <jaubourg> and involved so much reshuffling it's almost painful
[05:19:00] <DaveMethvin> ?10824
[05:19:01] <bot-t> [#10824] jQuery.ajax ($.ajax) and its memory leaking (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/10824
[05:19:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's more like it bot-t
[05:19:23] <DaveMethvin> but thanks for tryna find me a job
[05:19:23] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: it's obviously pre-1.5
[05:19:59] <jaubourg> oh yep, it's even said in the bug report itself
[05:20:22] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah 1.4.2
[05:20:24] <jaubourg> it's a wontfix unless we want to document the workaound for an older version?
[05:20:42] <DaveMethvin> do we even mark old version bugs wontfix?
[05:20:50] <jaubourg> that's pretty much why I undefine the transport in ajax as soon as the response has been received
[05:21:00] <DaveMethvin> if they can't repro it in the latest version then it's not a valid bug
[05:21:18] <jaubourg> (and also why I don't want to tackle the Firefox CORS header ticket that would break any kind of comportementalization)
[05:21:38] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: there are more than a few like that in the open css bugs
[05:21:50] <jaubourg> btw, is it me or isn't Firefox going all "let's break stuff all around" lately?
[05:21:54] <DaveMethvin> if they are fixed in the current release then they are fixed
[05:21:55] <mikesherov> css has a few that aren't reproducible in latest version
[05:22:18] <DaveMethvin> did you see the ticket I had for event.timestamp being wrong?  2004!
[05:22:25] <DaveMethvin> they haven't fixed it
[05:22:55] <DaveMethvin> ?10755
[05:22:56] <bot-t> [#10755] e.timeStamp (JQ 1.7)  wrong value in Firefox (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10755
[05:22:57] <jaubourg> yeah, I really have no clue how Mozilla priotirize stuff
[05:23:09] <mikesherov> jaubourg: poor FF, trying to keep up with Chrome
[05:23:16] <jaubourg> sometimes it feels like the good old Java bug parade of the late 90s
[05:23:40] <DaveMethvin> they have definitely fallen from grace
[05:23:59] <mikesherov> unfortunately, open source just has a hard time keeping up with a dedicated team
[05:24:17] <DaveMethvin> google money doesn't hurt, that's for sure
[05:24:39] <mikesherov> they proved that IE's stranglehold was overcomeable, and for that should be commended
[05:24:48] <mikesherov> they made the viability of chrome possible
[05:25:00] <DaveMethvin> yep, and they're not a bad browser, it's just that they are trying to move too fast for the resources they have
[05:25:17] <mikesherov> but I can't imagine a scenario in which they break chrome's momentum
[05:25:20] <jaubourg> I wouldn't bury firefox just yet but it truly doesn't have the same feel of excellence as it used to
[05:25:36] <mikesherov> No, I'm not burying it at all.
[05:25:49] <mikesherov> It'll be around for a looooong time
[05:25:50] <DaveMethvin> i don't want them to move too fast because it puts pressure on us as well
[05:26:05] <DaveMethvin> like, being able to integrate all the CSS3/4 animations into jQuery
[05:26:23] <mikesherov> it'll just be #3 until chrome eats all of IE, and then it'll be #2 again
[05:26:45] <mikesherov> I think putting the pressure on us is a good thing ;-)
[05:26:51] <DaveMethvin> ie 6/7/8 has incredible staying power b/c of the numbers they have, plus corporate adoption
[05:26:56] <mikesherov> easy for me to say though, I'm not a core team member
[05:27:20] <jaubourg> what I'd love to see is browser devs paying a little more attention to what's going on lib-side
[05:27:21] <DaveMethvin> well i don't mind putting in new things
[05:27:33] <DaveMethvin> but i want to remove old things too and that can cause controversy
[05:27:53] <mikesherov> core plugin: problem solved :-P
[05:27:53] <DaveMethvin> i don't see how we can remove ie6/7/8 support for several years
[05:28:10] <DaveMethvin> we can refactor a lot of that stuff out in a way that makes it easy to chop
[05:28:22] <mikesherov> I mean, this is that argument that jQuery has tons of IE6 stuff
[05:28:28] <mikesherov> when it's really IE6/7/8 stuff
[05:28:41] <mikesherov> so, yeah, we can remove IE6 in a year, but it's not even worth it
[05:28:43] <jaubourg> we're pretty much doomed with CSS transitions and animations... putting this kind of power is CSS may seem nice at first glance but it's as bad as IE CSS behaviour were back in the days: two concurrent ways to "program" stuff
[05:29:16] <mikesherov> but maybe that's not jQuery's job
[05:29:19] <DaveMethvin> well they are there so we need some sort of peaceful coexistence ... i guess we can coexist by jquery ignoring them
[05:29:29] <mikesherov> like who says jQuery needs to do CSS3 animations
[05:29:35] <jaubourg> well, that won't cut it sadly
[05:29:44] <jaubourg> because we need to, at least, be able to sync with them
[05:30:06] <jaubourg> that already comes with all kind of worms in the can
[05:30:09] <mikesherov> well, I'd love to be on the forefront of that battle
[05:30:27] <DaveMethvin> put on your hip waders mikesherov
[05:30:54] <DaveMethvin> i know gnarf intends to takle at least some of that in the animation rewrite
[05:31:02] <jaubourg> mikesherov: being on the forefront means not having any kind of real decision power, you can only react to what's been decided in comittees, don't be too eager to get there ;P
[05:31:05] <mikesherov> yeah, I already spoke to him
[05:31:23] <mikesherov> yeah, I'm the grunt, while the generals are decided my fate :\
[05:31:28] * jaubourg puts on his infantery suit
[05:31:45] <jaubourg> and most of the time it feels like WWI's trenches
[05:31:56] <DaveMethvin> i am interested in finding out what we really CAN get rid of and refactor
[05:32:20] <mikesherov> gnarf thought that css3 anims, because they aren't settable in .style.propname , need to be done with adding a stylesheet rule
[05:32:20] <DaveMethvin> once you start looking at dependencies it becomes clear that certain features are not good for modularity
[05:32:30] <mikesherov> when in fact, it's settable with .style.cssText
[05:32:45] <mikesherov> still a mess, but not as much as mess as adding a stylesheet rule
[05:32:56] <DaveMethvin> innnnteresting
[05:33:09] <jaubourg> mike: adding a stylesheet rule is probably much cleaner in the end though
[05:33:13] <mikesherov> yeah, like when window is not in focus, css3 stops animating !!!!
[05:33:15] <mikesherov> MAYBE
[05:33:20] <DaveMethvin> could we do it the other way round and process the ss rule for back compat with old browsers?
[05:33:41] <mikesherov> we'll find out, I'm sure
[05:34:01] <DaveMethvin> also, effects are a very likely candidate for becoming an independent plugin
[05:34:06] <jaubourg> the real decision is this: do we keep hard-timing or just give up on that and pause everything when out of focus
[05:34:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah we need to tackle the whole requestAnimationFrame thing again
[05:34:34] <jaubourg> yeah, effects and ajax should be out of core already
[05:34:41] <mikesherov> jaubourg, I think experience teaches that, as goes the standards, so goes jQuery
[05:34:59] <DaveMethvin> like i mentioned before tho, i'd love to see a very simple ajax and jsonp
[05:35:06] <jaubourg> except ajax is used  to execute scripts synchronously (which will fail for cross-domain but meh)
[05:35:25] <DaveMethvin> something that didn't have much functionality but would let peple do simple things
[05:35:29] <mikesherov> and, you know what, if we extract effects, we can always make a separate plugin, or option that allows the user to decide
[05:35:41] <mikesherov> css3 effects, or legacy strict timer
[05:35:46] <jaubourg> mikesherov: experience shows that the standard nearly never learns from the past and existing libs
[05:36:03] <mikesherov> no, I'm not saying the standard is right
[05:36:13] <mikesherov> to your point, I'm saying we have no choice but to go there
[05:36:18] <jaubourg> I hear you, I'm just rambling like the old cook I am
[05:36:24] <DaveMethvin> the problem with the current ajax api, which jaubourg inherited, is that its one monolithic thing and that makes it hard to document, use, and refactor
[05:36:47] <mikesherov> I submit as evidence, the sizzle rewrite to match qSa
[05:37:06] <mikesherov> much easier to just match what has become the standard
[05:37:28] <mikesherov> which, ironically, is one of the things that was championed by the libs
[05:37:30] <jaubourg> anyway, I gotta go take the dog out and then have a little nap before the gf gets back home
[05:37:35] <mikesherov> later
[05:37:46] <DaveMethvin> later!
[05:38:12] <DaveMethvin> so mikesherov i saw you work in nyc near penn station?
[05:38:21] <jaubourg> but I say: never give up, never surrender, if the standard is wrong, then it will fade away eventually and jQuery will have to provide a sane approach in the meantime, as usual
[05:38:32] <mikesherov> like, 2 blocks
[05:38:49] <mikesherov> that's the spirit jaubourg!
[05:38:53] <mikesherov> LOL
[05:39:03] <DaveMethvin> nice, i get up there from time to time so we should do lunch some day
[05:39:12] <mikesherov> would love that
[05:39:45] <DaveMethvin> so does your employer give you something like 20% time for projects, or do you steal it away on the train and such?
[05:39:58] <mikesherov> They let me do what I want
[05:40:06] <DaveMethvin> zowie!
[05:40:13] <mikesherov> I steal jQuery time on the train though
[05:40:23] <mikesherov> I mean, when I'm at work, I'm needed all the time
[05:40:30] <mikesherov> so, I can't really get 20% there
[05:40:36] <DaveMethvin> i'm a consultant so i just bill outrageous rates and work half the time
[05:40:45] <mikesherov> but if I said, I need to write some jQuery now, they'd be cool with it
[05:40:56] <mikesherov> Yeah, I'm lead dev.
[05:41:06] <mikesherov> the company is SNAP Interactive.
[05:41:26] <mikesherov> publicly traded, a couple of huge facebook apps
[05:41:31] <mikesherov> but really small team
[05:41:41] <mikesherov> sometimes I'm amazed at what we accomplish
[05:41:53] <DaveMethvin> software is funny that way
[05:41:57] <mikesherov> so my time is demanded pretty much the entire day every day
[05:42:08] <DaveMethvin> as long as the server holds out a small number of people can serve a lot
[05:42:08] <mikesherov> and at this point, I'm architecting usually
[05:42:30] <mikesherov> and I'm one of those who loves actual coding... so I do that in my free time
[05:42:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah me too
[05:42:47] <DaveMethvin> writing code is fun
[05:42:51] <DaveMethvin> like solving a puzzle
[05:42:52] <mikesherov> agreed
[05:42:56] <mikesherov> exactly right
[05:43:04] <mikesherov> I was doing jigsaw puzzles at 2
[05:43:09] <mikesherov> it was in my blood
[05:43:22] <mikesherov> my wife can't understand
[05:43:28] <mikesherov> "why are you working now?"
[05:43:35] <mikesherov> "it's not work"
[05:43:40] <DaveMethvin> it's FUN!
[05:43:47] <mikesherov> Exactly
[05:44:02] <mikesherov> I especially loving learning a new tool
[05:44:17] <mikesherov> like now, I'm all about learning about jQuery
[05:44:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah i have learned about a lot of tools and techniques working on jquery
[05:44:29] <mikesherov> and it's lead to tons of things
[05:44:42] <DaveMethvin> definitely helps at work as well
[05:44:47] <mikesherov> I can write unit tests (which I didn't have tons of experience before)
[05:44:56] <mikesherov> I can use git (which I was using svn before)
[05:45:09] <DaveMethvin> every time i go to a company and start running Chrome debugger, they're like, "what's that tool?"
[05:45:35] <mikesherov> I now need to learn JSHint internals, so I can convince jaubourg to use it :-P
[05:45:41] <DaveMethvin> lol
[05:45:55] <DaveMethvin> coding standards are all about compromise
[05:46:03] <mikesherov> yeah, chrome debugger gets better all the time
[05:46:13] <DaveMethvin> the core standard is a little too space-happy for me but when in rome...
[05:46:16] <DaveMethvin> and all that
[05:46:20] <mikesherov> Yeah, I think the reordering thing is worth it, a fair compromise
[05:46:36] <mikesherov> but, I hear jaubourg, and you, so it's worth it to me to investigate
[05:46:38] <DaveMethvin> well if it finds those evil globals it's a win for me
[05:46:53] <mikesherov> in the end, either I can give you guys what you want, or I learn a shit ton about JSHint... win win
[05:47:39] <DaveMethvin> i think the 1.8 stuff is going to be interesting
[05:47:52] <DaveMethvin> we'll have to see what sort of size improvements we can get
[05:47:56] <DaveMethvin> a lot of experimentation there
[05:47:57] <mikesherov> and honestly, the changes look drastic, but what do you expect when you go without a standard and then implement it
[05:48:08] <mikesherov> yeah, skunkworks are fun
[05:48:18] <DaveMethvin> but from that spreadsheet it's clear that we won't get a big reduction without something drastic
[05:48:25] <DaveMethvin> whether that's closure compiler i don't know
[05:48:34] <DaveMethvin> b/c it's a royal pain to follow all its rules
[05:48:39] <mikesherov> That's why I stayed out of John's post until someone proposed some action
[05:49:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah if we just eliminate the common issues i think closure will do a better job
[05:49:03] <mikesherov> I don't know the best yet, but I do know that I can help whatever decision is made
[05:49:13] <DaveMethvin> and it sounds like the cc guys  need to do some work on their end
[05:49:22] <mikesherov> yeah
[05:49:26] <mikesherov> well, for sure
[05:49:41] <mikesherov> you saw they released closure compiler for css yesterday?
[05:49:45] <DaveMethvin> unless we're gonna unroll all the places where we define functions via $.each(array of strings)
[05:49:51] <DaveMethvin> no i didn't
[05:50:00] <mikesherov> a glorified less/sass competitor
[05:50:16] <DaveMethvin> with all the stupid prefixes it's a good idea
[05:50:38] <DaveMethvin> tho so many ppl don't use any tools at all
[05:51:10] <DaveMethvin> i was reverse engineering some big-name sites and html apps lately for a client and you'd be surpised how bad they are inside
[05:51:25] <DaveMethvin> no compression, no sass, nothing
[05:51:29] <mikesherov> not surprised by anything
[05:51:48] <mikesherov> the number of "real programmers" out there is surprisingly small
[05:51:52] <DaveMethvin> i  haven't seen any that use closure compiler
[05:51:57] <DaveMethvin> that tells you something
[05:52:01] <mikesherov> yeah
[05:52:16] <mikesherov> especially when you're jQuery and you're on 50% of top 10K sites
[05:52:32] <mikesherov> but it's true
[05:52:40] <DaveMethvin> even the guys not using jquery don't use cc
[05:52:51] <DaveMethvin> it's miserable to debug for one thing
[05:52:58] <DaveMethvin> i can deal with uglified source
[05:52:59] <mikesherov> it's an advanced tool that still needs some work before people can figure out whether or not it's worth it
[05:53:56] <mikesherov> I mean, in a very real sense, pro javascript is still a fairly new concept
[05:54:37] <mikesherov> and the need for saving every last byte, no matter the cost, (because of mobile) is also new
[05:55:05] <mikesherov> well, it's old because of modems, but new for the current gen of programmers/technologies
[05:55:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah, we can only get so far out ahead of the audience using the tool ... i understand that truly advanced ppl may be able to use closure but for the 99% we will most likely need something simpler
[05:55:33] <mikesherov> agreed
[05:55:38] <mikesherov> I think AMD makes sense
[05:55:42] <DaveMethvin> we'll just need to play with it over the next few weeks and see where it leads
[05:55:59] <mikesherov> modularize the thing, tell people they don't need effects
[05:56:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah my "cut line comment" was basically to the effect that we have a /* ----- */ in the code saying "if you don't need ie8 support delete this
[05:56:46] <mikesherov> and I think timmywil's idea about support needing to be broken out is spot on, but I don't see that as bad
[05:57:15] <DaveMethvin> and there can still be some done early, like opacity
[05:58:25] <mikesherov> yeah, my thought is that, in practicality, we should be standardized our comments around deprecation, and which browsers cause us to use which hacks
[05:58:32] <mikesherov> he made a list of tests to make sure the values were right in the right browser
[05:58:41] <mikesherov> but like, timmy even did it when he refactored the support stuff
[05:58:46] <mikesherov> not that we should go back to UA sniffing
[05:59:01] <mikesherov> so those unit tests should just stay there
[05:59:20] <mikesherov> and serve as documentation for anyone who's clamoring for us to drop IE6
[05:59:56] <mikesherov> </rant>
[05:59:56] <DaveMethvin> once we take inventory on that i'd love to make a post about what browser carries what cost so we can put the "drop ie6" argumetn to rest
[06:00:11] <mikesherov> yeah
[06:00:12] <mikesherov> I'd love to help on that
[06:00:28] <mikesherov> I can make a build "without ie6", and we can post the diff
[06:00:28] <DaveMethvin> if we could drop ie 6/7/8 then there could be some big savings and refactoring but that is dream city right now
[06:00:41] <mikesherov> anyway, train is in the station
[06:00:47] <DaveMethvin> cya later
[06:00:51] <mikesherov> catch you on the train ride home

[07:30:57] <timmywil> haha
[07:34:44] <DaveMethvin> bot-t: do you have morning sickness?
[07:34:45] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, Don't count on it.
[07:34:53] <DaveMethvin> ah that's the bot-t we love
[07:44:56] <ryanneufeld> oh wow 10810....
[08:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> before I dig into the code, does anyone know off the top of their head why animating z-index doesn't work?
[08:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> got it, zIndex has to be an integer, but it ends up as a float during animation
[08:16:21] <scott_gonzalez> so it just needs a custom step
[08:22:31] <Centril> Hey! I tried to make an enhancement to the jQuery core adding to the functionality of jQuery.event.special: http://jsfiddle.net/qURbR/1/
[08:26:49] <Centril> awfully quiet in here ;) - I hope the code is of good quality - or that someone can improve it.
[08:29:36] <Centril> Also, there seems to be a bug on Line 3073: "if ( !special.teardown || special.teardown.call( elem, namespaces ) === false ) {" - special.teardown is called with a RegExp, which it didn't in jQuery 1.6
[08:36:52] <sl00> Hi. I am working on a new widget and everything worked fine until I created another instance. I have two private variables _main_container and _last_args. But somehow _last_args seemsto be shared between all instances. Why is that? What have I missed?
[08:40:25] <sl00> I seems it is shared as soon as it is an object/array ?!
[08:45:27] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/HotYHw
[08:45:27] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Remove rdigit now that it is no longer necessary - timmywil
[08:46:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: beat you
[08:46:26] <timmywil> hahaha ;)
[08:46:34] <DaveMethvin> damn
[08:46:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah but my comment was first!!!!
[08:46:53] <timmywil> hehe, true
[08:46:57] <timmywil> i didn't see it tho
[08:47:18] <timmywil> until after
[08:47:47] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: were we thinking Monday or today for release?
[08:47:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think that is enough time
[08:48:02] <DaveMethvin> like monday after the meeting maybe?
[08:48:06] <DaveMethvin> assuming no problems arise
[08:48:19] <timmywil> sounds good
[08:48:27] <Centril> Release, is jQuery 1.8 due?
[08:48:37] <timmywil> Centril: 1.7.1
[08:48:40] <Centril> aha
[08:48:53] <Centril> maybe you could think about my "enhancement", see if you like it
[08:49:10] <DaveMethvin> Centril: the special events stuff?
[08:49:15] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: we should get that form up for submitting 1.8 proposals
[08:49:16] <Centril> yup
[08:49:25] <Centril> and the bug ;)
[08:49:28] <timmywil> JohnResig: ^^
[08:49:29] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yeah i plan on doing that monday at the latest
[08:49:29] <Centril> (if it is one)
[08:49:34] <timmywil> ok cool
[08:50:09] <DaveMethvin> tryna think of words that might shape the types of submissions we get so it's less pie-in-the-sky and more focused
[08:50:26] <timmywil> I'm not sure that's possible
[08:50:38] <DaveMethvin> Centril: i don't think it's common at all that someone needs multiple hooks on the same event
[08:51:07] <DaveMethvin> event hooks are not meant to be a general extension mechanism, more of a way to shim support across browsers
[08:51:33] <DaveMethvin> we went through this discussion with attrHooks and valHooks as well
[08:52:09] <DaveMethvin> you can create some kind of awesome extensible mechanism that lets people completely redefine the meaning of .attr() or .val() or .on() for  specific events...
[08:52:27] <DaveMethvin> but that is actually a bad thing because it's hard to understand from the api level
[08:52:31] <Centril> Hehe - I needed it for: http://jsfiddle.net/Centril/Urfcw/ tho
[08:53:12] <DaveMethvin> focus is probably one of the worst possible ones, unfortunately
[08:53:27] <DaveMethvin> so i feel your pain
[08:53:56] <DaveMethvin> i just don't think the need for multiple handlers is common enough for a special.addHandler method
[08:54:04] <DaveMethvin> and the corresponding code weight
[08:54:14] <Centril> yeah... it's quite long ;)
[08:54:27] <DaveMethvin> btw, let me get the draft docs for you
[08:54:32] <Centril> But is the argument passed on line 3073 supposed to be a RegExp? - cause if I'd get the actual array of namespace, I could just make the "enhancement" a plugin.
[08:54:34] <DaveMethvin> maybe you can give some feedback
[08:55:19] <Centril> Sure!
[08:56:34] <DaveMethvin> damn, chrome crashed just a sec
[08:57:13] <timmywil> hahaha, i love seeing "Keywords change from to jqueries"
[08:57:14] <DaveMethvin> https://docs.google.com/document/d/11rRFvC51lDU8SBqgcsR5XwVKUeW__RO643iXSEVOdQ4/edit
[08:57:40] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: gotta track those you know :D
[08:59:40] <timmywil> :)
[09:00:19] <DaveMethvin> Centril: that's the link for the event extensions docs, i hope to have them in some public place soon
[09:01:01] <Centril> ah, reading it now - quite long =)
[09:01:01] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #211: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/211/
[09:01:01] <jq-jenkins> timmywillisn: Remove rdigit now that it is no longer necessary
[09:06:51] <Centril> DaveMethvin: btw, why is the use of the ternary operator not encouraged in the coding standards? I love that operator ;)
[09:07:24] <DaveMethvin> it's not discouraged in an expression context, but it is not condoned as a statement replacement
[09:08:54] <Centril> ah, so: var a = $.isFunction(func) ? 1337 : 42; is fine?
[09:14:08] <DaveMethvin> Centril: right
[09:21:14] <Centril> DaveMethvin: A much less bloated form of somewhat adding what I need to the core is just to call all special event handlers from a function that just iterates a passed list & executes each element - and in the core, each special-event-handler can be wrapped in a single element list.
[09:22:09] <Centril> say the function is called $.event.iterateSpecial... or something, and then it is possible to overwrite this function with something more extensive
[09:22:35] <DaveMethvin> take a look at the handle hook near the bottom of the list, i think it might do what you need
[09:25:40] <DaveMethvin> focus doesn't have a "handle" hook, you could just save the info about the key/mouse element when they happen and when you handle the focus event augment the event object with the source
[09:25:50] <DaveMethvin> that's gonna be a lot easier i think
[09:25:53] <Clooth> ajpiano: did you guys have that meeting yet? ;)
[09:26:30] <DaveMethvin> Clooth: you talking bout the 1.8 meeting?
[09:26:34] <Clooth> no
[09:26:36] <DaveMethvin> oh
[09:26:45] <Clooth> ajpiano knows what I'm talking about :D
[09:27:13] <Centril> DaveMethvin: Yeah, that's pretty easy to do - you could even write a wrapper jQuery.enhancedFocus(...) to bind it for you, but it is not as sexy as automation ;)
[09:28:20] <DaveMethvin> oh you want it to be a new event name centril?
[09:29:23] <Centril> no - but you could use a wrapper-function to bind mousedown & focus for you, instead of using special events
[09:29:34] <Clooth> http://cupcakeipsum.com/
[09:30:10] <Centril> still wondering about the argument supplied to teardown handlers... in 1.6 a list of namespaces is passed - in 1.7 a regex is passed (a regex for checking namespaces) - seems like a bug
[09:30:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's a bug, but it's a bug that you're looking at it
[09:31:13] <DaveMethvin> the namespace is for the last event detached and has nothing to do with the master handler
[09:31:38] <DaveMethvin> that is, the second-to-last event removed may have had a different namespace, or none at all
[09:32:05] <DaveMethvin> so if they are removed in differnet orders, teardown gets different namespaces
[09:32:11] <DaveMethvin> you can't depend on it
[09:32:23] <DaveMethvin> and it really shouldn't be passed at all
[09:32:34] <iPaintCode> Does anyone know if you can target this object outside of firebug: http://cl.ly/BtxN (inside that it has an object I'm trying to access it's showing window > Object in the DOM).
[09:33:08] <DaveMethvin> iPaintCode: probably a better q for a different group
[09:33:17] <DaveMethvin> i'd say #jquery but it doens't seem like  a jquery issue
[09:33:27] <iPaintCode> Tried last week and no luck
[09:33:32] <iPaintCode> Sorry man for asking...
[09:35:26] <Centril> DaveMethvin: ah, noticed now
[09:36:01] <DaveMethvin> for your event maybe pick a different name, i don't think a namespace is the appropriate way to do that
[09:36:39] <Centril> It not that hard to make your own setup/teardown handlers - I should probably do that instead
[09:37:54] <Centril> DaveMethvin: a custom event that binds focus & mousedown on setup/add?
[09:40:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah something like that, setup/teardown is fine but using a namespace isn't because what if .off("focus") gets called last on that elmeent? Your special event teardown doens;t happen
[09:40:54] <sl00> Can someone take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/9PU5z/2/ and explain to me why some (the push-array and the objects) variables are shared between instances.
[09:41:29] <Centril> DaveMethvin: aight
[09:41:42] <Centril> Clooth: great link, cupcakeipsum ;)
[09:42:20] <DaveMethvin> sl00: sorry but this is the wrong group
[09:42:55] <sl00> Oh okey.
[09:45:47] <iPaintCode> So Dave this was a plugin I writing so what other channels do you suggest? "sorry but this is the wrong group" isn't a great answer
[09:49:24] <timmywil> iPaintCode: #jquery is the best place
[09:50:23] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: docs#10829
[09:50:25] <iPaintCode> Had no luck was pointed to here
[09:50:26] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, [#10829] IE9 crashes when running jQuery Data tests suite from swarm.jquery.org (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/10829
[09:50:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah saw that timmywil
[09:50:36] <timmywil> do you have 64-bit windows?
[09:50:38] <timmywil> i don't
[09:50:56] <DaveMethvin> yes i do and no problems running the ie9 32-bit which is what most people use
[09:51:03] <DaveMethvin> that is, 64-bit os and 32-bit browser
[09:51:21] <DaveMethvin> so let me test with the 64bit one
[09:52:03] <DaveMethvin> data runs fine from localhost
[09:52:21] <DaveMethvin> running full tests now
[09:52:44] <timmywil> iPaintCode: this room is for discussion of the development of jQuery.  If someone did suggest pointing you here, that was the wrong suggestion.
[09:53:36] <timmywil> gotta run to a lunch meeting
[09:54:07] <iPaintCode> bummer...
[09:57:16] <danzik171> DaveMethvin: just curious, is there a hosted site to run the jquery test suite on the git build?  you know, without needing to set up the whole deal on localhost - i've got a couple test boxes at work i can use for stuff like that, but dont really wanna have to keep jquery up to sync on local or set it back up if i reimage the box
[09:57:40] <DaveMethvin> not that i know of
[09:58:30] <DaveMethvin> if we didn't need that tiny little bit of php we could even use gh-pages
[09:58:57] <DaveMethvin> i guess it could skip ajax tests, i think that's the only place it's used
[09:59:32] <danzik171> it'd be a little bit of work, but i'm sure google would donate some google app engine resources for that if you asked
[09:59:37] <danzik171> and just set up the response stuff on there
[09:59:53] <danzik171> or somethin
[10:00:23] <DaveMethvin> well we  have testswarm for master so if you just need to know what's passing you can look there
[10:00:26] <DaveMethvin> ?swarm
[10:00:26] <bot-t> Swarm Status: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/qunit/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerycolor/ -- Jenkins http://swarm.jquery.org:8080
[10:00:42] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/447/
[10:01:05] <danzik171> nah, i was more referring to you wanting to test 64bit IE and whatnot
[10:01:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah i figured
[10:30:37] <iPaintCode> timmywil: Got it, fired up FireQuery and tracked down the issue in my plugin. Thanks for the help
[10:52:40] <Clooth> ajpiano is a noob
[11:00:07] <kswedberg> upi
[11:06:36] <ajpiano> Clooth: hey :)
[11:06:51] <Clooth> the missing child returns
[11:07:02] <ajpiano> i'm taking most of today to bond with assassin's creed revelations lol
[11:07:07] <Clooth> meh, games
[11:07:19] <Clooth> ever since I started building my career I haven't played almost any game actively
[11:07:33] <ajpiano> anyhow, yes, we did have a little meeting
[11:07:40] <ajpiano> well, good on you for that :p
[11:07:41] <Clooth> talk in pm?
[11:07:49] <ajpiano> sure
[11:09:18] <jaubourg> please people, leave your thought after my latests message in the jquery-bug-team list jQuery size thread
[11:09:46] <jaubourg> I really really feel like I'm alone against John and I truly hate it when I know a lot think the exact same thing I do
[11:10:13] <jaubourg> that being said, time to go get some dinner with the gf ;)
[12:25:44] <timmywil> kswedberg: yt?
[12:25:55] <kswedberg> hey timmywil
[12:26:17] <timmywil> I'm looking for that clap you had for the docs styleguide
[12:27:04] <kswedberg> http://oksoclap.com/jquery-api-style-guide
[12:27:22] <timmywil> awesome, thanks!
[12:27:28] <kswedberg> :) np
[12:46:55] <timmywil> oh svg docs#10832
[12:46:57] <bot-t> [#10832] jQuery.contains() fails with SVG elements in IE9 (includes solution) ( you end up with a situation where jQuery reports that two elements contain each other.) - http://jqbug.com/10832
[15:06:22] <jaubourg> maybe I should just quit... the level of stupidity is deafening
[15:26:19] <JohnResig> gah, I think I just missed jaubourg
[15:40:06] <ajpiano> yeah he seems to be really riled up
[15:40:27] <tbranyen> :(
[15:40:30] <JohnResig> I'm not sure what's going on :(
[15:40:37] <ajpiano> i'm not either
[15:40:46] <ajpiano> it's like
[15:41:03] <ajpiano> if it's not too much work, we should support CC with advanced mode for jquery core
[15:41:15] <ajpiano> and modules is like, a relatively separate discussion
[15:41:42] <ajpiano> i am not sure why he is so mad!
[15:42:27] <JohnResig> yeah, it does seem like it, I'm not sure either - he seems to be very combative and throwing insults here is baffling to me
[15:42:44] <ajpiano> yeah and no one else is
[15:43:04] <ajpiano> so its .. bizarre
[15:45:38] <JohnResig> I feel like this is an opportunity to steer people towards best practices while providing an excellent solution at the same time
[15:47:10] <ajpiano> it's also just like, we get flack for a) not being able to run through on advanced mode and b) being too big - the fact that jQuery itself running through advanced mode won't save people who AREN'T otherwise optimising their code for advanced mode won't make a difference
[15:47:12] <ajpiano> is like... who cares?
[15:48:38] <ajpiano> the people who want to run their jquery through advanced mode on CC are likely NOT the same people who have 18 3rd party plugins of which they don't know implementatino details
[17:05:16] <clarkbox> whats the deal with jquery tmpl/jsrender? i thought tmpl was going away, in place of jsrender? but here http://jquery.org/updates/2011/11/05/grid-status-update-16/ i see a reference to tmpl?
[17:05:42] <clarkbox> and the grid is still using tmpl - is it transitioning over to jsrender?
[17:05:55] <clarkbox> maybe a question that belongs in jqueryui-dev
[17:07:20] <clarkbox> ohh, i see jsRnder in this demo - http://view.jqueryui.com/grid-jsrender/grid-spf/grid-plain.html
[17:07:53] <clarkbox> so whats the deal? if im looking to use a template lib in my project, is it a safe bet to go with jsRender?
[17:10:15] <DaveMethvin> clarkbox: neither of those is currently owned by the jquery project; tmpl is not being supported by boris and he's working on jsrender now
[17:10:38] <clarkbox> yes, but will jsrender be a requirement for the grid?
[17:10:56] <clarkbox> or is another template lib under development for inclusion within UI ?
[17:14:50] <DaveMethvin> there was a post about this on the jquery blog, i don't want to misquote it so you might take a look there
[17:16:40] <DaveMethvin> clarkbox: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/04/16/official-plugins-a-change-in-the-roadmap/
[17:18:46] <clarkbox> ah i recall that post now. thanks for the link.
[18:33:30] <mikesherov> timmywil: you here?
