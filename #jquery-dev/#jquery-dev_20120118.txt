[10:28:20] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know off the top of their heads what might be causing this layout issue from a support test in UI? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8026
[10:49:19] <DaveMethvin> hey scott_gonzalez, i landed something that may fix that layout issue last night: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/2982abbb13454bd4bdf0299f1183fb0d8c02f02d
[10:49:20] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by dmethvin (17h, 7m ago): fixes #11048: make sure support tests don't modify the layout of the body
[10:50:13] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: well, this is from a support test in UI
[10:50:25] <DaveMethvin> oh uh
[10:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> The comments on that commit don't give me the warm fuzzies for doing the same thing in the UI support test :-/
[10:51:08] <scott_gonzalez> It's supposedly from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.core.js#L222
[10:51:55] <DaveMethvin> sounds similar to the black magic i landed there
[10:52:46] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'll test it out later and see if it helps.
[11:42:37] <clarkbox> anyone know why jenkins is out of control?

[12:10:18] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: you around?
[12:22:02] <clarkbox> im going to kill jenkins unless someone says otherwise...
[12:24:36] <ajpiano> if it's acting out, i suppose that'lll be necessary no matter what?
[12:27:04] <clarkbox> ya. just killed it
[12:27:09] <clarkbox> not sure how to bring it back tho
[12:33:53] <clarkbox> k, its started back up
