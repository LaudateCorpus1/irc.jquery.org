[06:24:44] <DaveMethvin> mornin timmywil
[06:24:56] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: mornin!
[06:25:10] <DaveMethvin> do you remember where we were discussing the requestAnimationFrame issue?
[06:25:24] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: heh, I was just looking for it myself
[06:25:28] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to mark that new ticket as a dup but i can't find the dup!
[06:25:47] <DaveMethvin> maybe it was a forum thread i'll look there
[06:27:11] <DaveMethvin> doesn't seem to be in the forum
[06:28:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ahah docs#9381
[06:28:20] <bot-t1> DaveMethvin, [#9381] setTimeout and fadeIn/fadeOut blocking in Chrome (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9381
[06:28:23] <timmywil> we should rename that
[06:29:07] <DaveMethvin> i think it just needs requestAnimationFrame in the description to be found
[06:29:26] <timmywil> how's this: docs#9381
[06:29:27] <bot-t1> [#9381] animations halt when the browser is out of focus due to requestAnimationFrame (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9381
[06:29:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah!
[06:29:49] <timmywil> :D
[06:29:52] <DaveMethvin> too bad the search sucks so bad ... the first comment from rwaldron says requestAnimationFrame
[06:31:28] <timmywil> yea
[06:39:42] <scott_gonzalez> anyone know about specific issues with HTTPS + CORS?
[06:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm making ajax requests to a server that has Access-Control headers
[06:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> HTTP requests are working fine, HTTPS requests come back with no content
[06:46:29] <timmywil> temp01: yt?
[06:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> jaubourg: know of any limitations?
[06:48:10] <timmywil> ?tell temp01 was wondering if I could check out the source for bot-t
[06:48:11] <bot-t1> timmywil, Okay.
[07:38:22] <matjas> Any more feedback re: http://mothereffingcssescapes.com/? About to "launch" it
[07:40:23] <matjas> Shit, wrong channel.
[08:28:42] <gseguin> rwaldron: ping
[08:30:39] <rwaldron> gseguin hey dude
[08:30:46] <rwaldron> saw your pin earlier
[08:30:48] <rwaldron> ping*
[08:30:51] <rwaldron> what;s up?
[08:31:02] <gseguin> I see that your the last commiter to ajax.js
[08:31:10] <gseguin> so you must be familiar with that code
[08:31:12] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L730
[08:31:44] <gseguin> shouldn't that be: state < 2
[08:32:06] <rwaldron> jaubourg yt?
[08:32:25] <gseguin> 'cause if I read the code right status is the HTTP status
[08:33:58] <rwaldron> gseguin jaubourg is actually the author of the ajax rewrite and could give you a better answer than i could
[08:37:40] <gseguin> alright, I'll ping him
[08:37:45] <gseguin> thanks rwaldron
[08:37:57] <rwaldron> he's in here...
[08:37:58] <rwaldron> lurking
[08:38:05] <rwaldron> jaubourg stop lurking!!
[08:38:10] <gseguin> I'll ask bot-t to tell him
[08:39:37] <gseguin> ?tell jaubourg: hey, I suspect there is a typo at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L730 , shouldn't it be: state < 2 ?
[08:39:37] <bot-t1> gseguin, Okay.
[08:52:49] <jaubourg> gseguin: yes, we're aware of that, it's buried in another bug report: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9585 ;)
[08:52:49] <bot-t1> (13 mins 10 secs ago) <gseguin> tell jaubourg: hey, I suspect there is a typo at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L730 , shouldn't it be: state < 2 ?
[08:52:54] <jaubourg> sorry I was afk
[08:52:59] <jaubourg> hi rick
[08:53:23] <gseguin> ok cool
[09:15:16] <jaubourg> timmywil: weren't we supposed to release 1.6.2 already?
[09:15:24] <jaubourg> or did I miss the release?
[09:20:25] <jaubourg> there are bugs I'd need to fix and I'm waiting for the release... since it's in RC :/
[10:50:46] <timmywil> .
[10:51:50] <timmywil> .
[10:51:57] <timmywil> weird
[10:52:09] <timmywil> aubourg: yea, I thought we were.  I haven't seen JohnResig  around
[10:52:13] <timmywil> jaubourg
[10:52:29] <timmywil> everything's tested except for one fail in Opera 11.5 on isXMLDoc
[10:52:40] <timmywil> ?seen JohnResig
[10:52:41] <bot-t1> timmywil, JQuery bot commands - The bot in the #jquery channel on Freenode has a few commands that should help in collaborative debugging or explanations. http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_bot_commands
[10:56:15] <JohnResig> timmywil: hey sorry, in a meeting
[10:56:15] <bot-t1> (46 hours 50 mins ago) <timmywil> tell JohnResig browser testing done except for one fail in Opera 11.5...only occurs on full suite: core: isXMLDoc - HTML iframe body element exception. 'body' at that point is an HTMLDocument as it should be, but all its properties are set to undefined, according to DragonFly
[10:57:23] <timmywil> JohnResig: np, whenever you get a sec
[10:58:13] <JohnResig> timmywil: sounds like another silly opera regression, imo
[10:58:42] <timmywil> JohnResig: yea, my assessment as well
