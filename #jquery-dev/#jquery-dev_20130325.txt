[07:53:00] <scott_gonzalez> bz said "natch". I did not see that coming.
[07:53:41] <DaveMethvin> what is WRONG with those guys, can't we just beat up Chrome until they drop window.event?
[07:54:03] <DaveMethvin> a transient object in global scope is a horrible pattern

[08:46:54] <shanejonas> for npmâ€¦ I want to include jquery in browserify but the jquery on npm includes jsdom by default.. which i dont want client side obviously.
[08:47:15] <shanejonas> i could point my package.json to the jquery repo but the package.json there doesnt point to anything by default.
[09:01:30] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer can you open #jquery-meeting since you're sysop?
[09:24:44] <jaubourg> hi there
[09:24:45] <b-ot> jaubourg: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:24:54] <jaubourg> `read
[09:24:54] <b-ot> jaubourg: From scott_gonzalez, 1mon 1d ago: My reply on trac quotes your reply, but is not directly specifically at you :-)
[09:25:05] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg cmon to the meeting!
[09:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> Hah, jaubourg, I don't even remember which ticket this was.
[09:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Are you aware that jquery-migrate has the wrong source map URL?
[09:27:34] <jaubourg> scott_gonzalez: neither can I :/
[09:27:49] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez i didn't even recall setting up sourcemap for it
[09:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> It's in all 3 versions.
[09:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.1.1
[09:28:39] <DaveMethvin> make me a ticket
[09:40:47] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/issues/33
[09:40:47] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #33 by scottgonzalez (19s ago): Incorrect `sourceMappingURL` on CDNs
[09:41:05] <DaveMethvin> got it thanks scott_gonzalez
[10:18:10] <gibson042> DaveMethvin et al.: I'd like to port the changes from making Sizzle excludeable to 1.9-stable for things like Gruntfile compatibility... any objections or recommendations (I'm not planning to introduce the "-sizzle" option or selector-native.js, just everything else from https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1083f82d1ee0c8f15a66be15e6184294a69d4420 and subsequent commits)
[10:18:10] <b-ot> gibson042: Richard Gibson (1mon 4d ago): Fix #13434: native-API selector module What's out: * 6 KB * attribute not equal selector * positional selectors (:first; :eq(n); :odd; etc.) * type selectors (:input; :checkbox; :button; etc.) * state-based selectors (:animated; :visible; :hidden; etc.) * :has(selector) * custom selectors * leading combinators (e.g., $collection.find("> *")) * reliable functionality on XML fragments * requiring all parts of a selector 
[10:19:33] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 sure if you want do do that, i suspect it will get even less use there than in 2.0 but there's only one way to find out :D
[10:20:07] <gibson042> oh I don't want the build flag, just the logic to support it
[10:20:23] <gibson042> so the Gruntfile .gitignore etc. don't diverge too much
[10:20:29] <DaveMethvin> ah ok
[10:20:31] <DaveMethvin> sure

[13:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I wrote "the community at large does not understand licensing" and someone asked me to back that up.
[13:13:03] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Want to poke around see if you can convince someone to remove window.event from Chrome (and ideally upstream WebKit)?
[15:17:18] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: can you file a ticket to get the conversation started?
[15:18:10] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: removing stuff is reallly hard. so. it'd be hard to do.
[15:48:38] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Is https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list the best place?
[15:48:48] <scott_gonzalez> The required fields make it a bit awkward.
[15:52:34] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: yup

[19:57:25] <DaveMethvin> sup timmywil
[19:57:39] <timmywil> having trouble getting a failing test
[19:57:52] <timmywil> one sec, I'll show you what I've got
[19:59:15] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/timmywil/sizzle/compare/jquery_13378
[20:00:22] <DaveMethvin> i just LOVE focus-related bugs
[20:00:50] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if it only happens if the enclosing page is pre-ready as well
[20:01:22] <DaveMethvin> which of course is just about impossible to unit test
[20:01:40] <timmywil> oh right, hmm
[20:02:29] <DaveMethvin> maybe a page with an iframe inside an iframe and the one in the middle is not .ready() ???
[20:02:37] <DaveMethvin> GAAAAH
[20:02:52] <timmywil> i'll try an iframe directly on the page
[20:04:23] <timmywil> ugh pass
[20:05:10] <timmywil> maybe autofucs
[20:06:14] <timmywil> I'm flabbergasted
[20:07:47] <DaveMethvin> so JohnResig mentioned they were seeing this at khan, maybe they have a repro case
[20:08:20] <DaveMethvin> that other thread said it only happens before .ready() and i *think* it's only in an iframe
[20:09:17] <DaveMethvin> so i guess the iframe is ready, initializes some stuff that sets focus, but the enclosing page isn't yet ready?
[20:12:34] <timmywil> wracking the brainz. I've called focus and added autofocus in the iframe, I put the iframe at the top of index. Maybe I should try the selection in the head in the iframe or something.
[20:13:03] <DaveMethvin> worth a try
[20:13:42] <timmywil> eh, can't read ownerDocument, that's not right
[20:19:49] <timmywil> well, I'll keep trying to get a failing test tomorrow
[20:20:10] <DaveMethvin> so frustrating
[20:21:17] <timmywil> ?tell gibson042 Trying to get a failing test. Let me know if you have any suggestions: https://github.com/timmywil/sizzle/compare/jquery_13378
[20:21:18] <b-ot> timmywil: Iâ€™ll tell gibson042 about that.
