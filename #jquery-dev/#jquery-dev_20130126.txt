[11:33:12] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[11:33:15] <DaveMethvin> what happened to that build?
[11:33:37] <DaveMethvin> swarmy took saturday off i guess
[11:34:39] <DaveMethvin> oh geez http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2413
[11:36:19] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: any idea what's going on with the swarm today?

[11:39:55] <doesallmagic> * dave.methvin: Fix build until next grunt rc, disable compare_size.
[11:40:10] <DaveMethvin> that's because  you didn't try very hard, swarmy
[11:40:19] <DaveMethvin> and i made the thing all buildy nice for you
[11:40:54] <DaveMethvin> even got it to run with grunt 0.4.0rc6.93-pre-gonna-change-tomorrow
[11:48:19] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you just love talking to yourself
[11:48:30] <mikesherov> it's like your favorite thing
[11:48:36] <DaveMethvin> well i hold up my end of the conversation
[11:48:48] <mikesherov> Sometimes I hope in irc, and I see a monologue between DaveMethvin and the empty room
[11:49:09] <mikesherov> i hop*
[11:49:28] <DaveMethvin> oh good, while you're here mikesherov ... http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13310
[11:51:07] <mikesherov> fun
[11:51:26] <mikesherov> I wasn't the only one to touch animations between 1.8.3 and 1.9, YA KNOW!
[11:51:34] <mikesherov> probably me though
[11:51:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah but you know more about the bodies there
[11:51:39] <mikesherov> that's annoying
[11:51:55] <mikesherov> ha, you mean the littany of dead bodies in that code?
[11:52:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[11:52:54] <DaveMethvin> it's like that Thriller video when i run on testswarm
[11:53:03] <DaveMethvin> except with less rhythm

[12:11:10] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: while you're futzing with package.json, you might as well remove the tildes
[12:11:19] <mikesherov> and we should never use them ever again
[12:11:34] <DaveMethvin> i'll remember that for next time
[12:11:39] <DaveMethvin> and there will be a next time
[12:12:02] <DaveMethvin> since i'm sure grunt 0.1.0rc9 will completely redo the api :P
[12:12:07] <mikesherov> and also, if' you're removing grunt-cli, you should be removing the "
[12:12:08] <mikesherov> 	"scripts": {
[12:12:09] <mikesherov> 		"test": "./node_modules/.bin/grunt"
[12:12:09] <mikesherov> 	},"
[12:12:33] <DaveMethvin> i had no idea why that was there tbh
[12:12:46] <DaveMethvin> thought it might be needed by testswarm or somerhing
[12:12:58] <mikesherov> nah
[12:13:07] <mikesherov> it's if someone does "npm test"
[12:13:10] <mikesherov> it runs that command
[12:13:29] <mikesherov> but since you removed grunt-cli (which is fine), that isn't gauranteed to be there
[12:13:41] <DaveMethvin> grunt-cli is supposed to be installed global
[12:13:46] <mikesherov> Yes
[12:13:47] <mikesherov> sure
[12:13:58] <mikesherov> point being, if someone just does:
[12:14:12] <mikesherov> npm install jquery & npm test
[12:14:27] <mikesherov> without first installing grunt-cli globally...
[12:14:39] <DaveMethvin> well we can put grunt-cli back but scott_gonzalez seemed pretty adamant that it shouldn't be local
[12:14:42] <DaveMethvin> or maybe i misunderstood
[12:14:48] <mikesherov> I agree with scott_gonzalez 
[12:14:57] <mikesherov> but we should also nuke the npm test stuff
[12:15:14] <mikesherov> because now it's broken. Either both or neither
[12:15:30] <DaveMethvin> is "npm test" some standard convention?
[12:15:50] <DaveMethvin> all our docs should just tell people to "grunt" i suppose
[12:15:58] <mikesherov> right
[12:16:01] <mikesherov> which they do
[12:16:15] <mikesherov> https://npmjs.org/doc/test.html
[12:16:51] <mikesherov> we don't need to provide one, I added it when we added grunt-cli locally
[12:16:56] <DaveMethvin> ok so the correct way forward is to remove the npm test?
[12:17:01] <mikesherov> yes
[12:17:05] <DaveMethvin> ok, noted
[12:17:16] <mikesherov> duly
[12:44:16] <ben_alman> interesting. http://jquery.com/404 and http://axecopwedding.com/404 error pages have the same copy on them
[12:44:54] <ben_alman> mikesherov: you should tell people to install grunt-cli globally
[12:45:04] <ben_alman> while installing locally will work, we won't support it
[12:45:12] <mikesherov> ben_alman: agreed
[12:45:22] <ben_alman> also, installing it globally allows the user to run grunt from any subdirectory with just "Grunt"
[12:45:51] <mikesherov> right
[12:46:04] <mikesherov> it does the nice directory traversal stuff for you
[12:46:08] <ben_alman> when we use travis-ci to test grunt we tell it to npm install -g grunt-cli pre-testing
[12:46:18] <ben_alman> in the .travis.yml
[12:46:37] <mikesherov> right, which makes sense
[12:46:54] <mikesherov> I suppose that could be the command in npm test then if we really wanted it to be
[12:47:15] <mikesherov> but I'd rather ditch npm test
[12:47:16] <ben_alman> no because the user might have a different version of grunt-cli installed for some reason
[12:47:42] <mikesherov> good point
[12:48:07] <ben_alman> npm test, just like most fields of package.json only makes sense if you're using npm to publish or install your module
[12:49:12] <ben_alman> ihttps://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/914
[12:49:13] <b-ot> ben_alman: Issue #914 by isaacs (20mon 2w ago): make name and version optional in package.json
[12:49:38] <ben_alman> projects that use grunt probably only REALLY need "devDependencies"
[12:49:40] <ben_alman> maybe engine
[12:49:44] <ben_alman> prob not
[12:49:56] <ben_alman> o well
