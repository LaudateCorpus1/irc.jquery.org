[12:42:35] <m_gol> markelog: Sorry, I only now understand what you meant. :) Definitely worth checking.
[12:42:50] <markelog> ok-ok
[13:03:21] <timmywil> markelog: something I can answer quickly?
[13:03:29] <timmywil> or you could add to the agenda for next week
[13:03:30] <m_gol> timmywil: I'd like to land it on Wednesday morning or before (unless someone has blocking comments before that moment); any chance to release 3.1.0 later this week?
[13:03:39] <markelog> not quickly :)
[13:03:43] <markelog> it can wait 
[13:03:46] <timmywil> cool
[13:03:54] <timmywil> m_gol: yup!
[13:04:00] <timmywil> if you get it in, I can release pretty quickly
[13:04:00] <m_gol> ok, great :)
[13:04:03] <m_gol> k
[13:04:03] <markelog> would be cool to release this week
[13:04:12] <markelog> would we need a blog post?
[13:04:17] <timmywil> I'll need to write a blog post, but I think it's just the one change
[13:04:22] <timmywil> should be a short post
[13:04:22] <markelog> )
[13:04:49] <timmywil> cyl!
