[06:39:12] <ezio> hey guys ... anyone know what happened to the spinner function?
[06:41:17] <ezio> nm
[06:41:36] <ezio> still undocumented though
[06:53:56] <ajpiano> ezio: we know
[06:54:17] <ezio> keep on rockin'!
[06:54:39] <ajpiano> ....
[06:54:49] <ajpiano> was about to link him to the xml

[09:06:02] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] JSHint: Remove redundant annotations from inject.js - Timo Tijhof
[09:20:20] <Krinkle> gnarf: I can't sudo on jq03, /var/www/swarm is root root
[10:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Are you aware of any issues that might occur if we go directly into the trac db and change the value of the milestone field for a bunch of tickets?
[10:20:50] <snover> scott_gonzalez: your last modified time will not update. why not just use the batch modify plugin that is installed?
[10:21:04] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Because that sends emails.
[10:21:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't want ~2000 emails being sent around.
[10:21:35] <snover> that’s why there is a “send email notifications” checkbox in it that you uncheck
[10:21:37] <scott_gonzalez> I just need to change 1.9 to 1.9.0, there's no actual content change.
[10:21:37] <snover> and then it does not send them
[10:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...we do not have that.
[10:22:03] <scott_gonzalez> We just have "Modify Ticket Changetime"
[10:22:12] <snover> hm. well, it existed at some point
[10:22:19] <snover> anyway, there are no fk constraints
[10:22:38] <snover> so you can meddle with the database directly as much as you want really
[10:23:04] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that's what I thought. Thanks.
[10:49:47] <Krinkle> gnarf: Is it okay if I work on the instance directly to set up stuff, or should I work exclusively through the puppet repo? (I'd like to test things first, especially since I know shit about puppet)
[10:50:01] <Krinkle> is there a local puppetmaster that I can use so that I don't have to work in the real repo?
[10:50:09] <Krinkle> (and then commit once it works)(
[10:52:04] <gnarf> don't worry too much about puppet
[10:53:46] <gnarf> Just document anything you need to change really
[10:54:15] <gnarf> also - RE: the puppet local - short of setting up a VM, there isn't any way to do that
[12:37:00] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: if you're around, would be nice if you could merge https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/285 - then I can upgrade node-qunit to 1.9.0 without local hacks (right now its on 1.7.0 or 1.6.0)
[12:37:01] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on qunit by Krinkle (15m, 41s ago): Keep a local reference to Date.
[12:37:18] <Krinkle> and thus use node-qunit on code that uses assert.throws :D
[12:38:11] <Krinkle> well, I wouldn't update node-qunit to use 1.9.0 but as git-submodule pointing HEAD
[13:39:32] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: here now
[13:40:51] <jzaefferer> merging now
[13:59:58] <jzaefferer> git is weird - I'm pretty sure I renamed your remote to be lowercase, but it'll only find the uppercase one
[14:00:11] <jzaefferer> also your naming convention of issue/[number] is annoying
[14:00:33] <jzaefferer> just [number] would be more useful to me, I could just type enough for autocomplete to match the rest
[14:01:10] <jzaefferer> anyway, landed
[14:01:11] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i like namespaced branches, don't come down on him for it :)
[14:01:31] <jqcommit> [qunit] jzaefferer pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/mmVd4A

[14:22:14] <i-hate-dave> * joern.zaefferer: Update readme to include some more release instructions
[14:33:47] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/286
[14:33:48] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #286 on qunit (cberzan; 8m, 1s ago): 'throws' is a reserved keyword
[14:35:57] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: it is only an "extra" reserved word in ES3. It is not an ES3 reserved word, and it is not reserved nor extra-reserved in ES5
[14:35:58] <Krinkle> a
[14:36:00] <Krinkle> and ES3 as well as ES5 browsers handle it fine
[14:36:07] <Krinkle> so bug in yui I suppose.
[14:36:11] <Krinkle> we web is moving on
[14:36:30] <Krinkle> bbl
[14:45:33] <jzaefferer> well, more in Rhino
[14:45:49] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: unrelated to QUnit: http://lolcat.biz/post/27368236760/ency-cl-opedia
[14:48:22] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: you around?
[15:19:03] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: here
[15:19:17] <DaveMethvin> so although i landed the pulls you made for sizzle, they're failing unit tests for jquery b/c of the horrible way we integrate sizzle tests ... jquery's index.html is a kinda-copy of the one in sizzle and it's a nightmare to make it work :(
[15:19:48] <DaveMethvin> i am thinking we should make the sizzle tests run in an iframe or something...
[15:19:58] <DaveMethvin> it's crazy the way it seems to work now
[15:20:02] <gibson042> hmm, yeah
[15:20:08] <DaveMethvin> or not work as the case may be :D
[15:20:36] <DaveMethvin> actually you can pull the current sizzle submodule in your jquery setup and see what i mean
[15:23:17] <gibson042> the latest sizzle master, or one of my branches?
[15:24:52] <DaveMethvin> in  your jquery setup, go to jquery/src/sizzle and `git pull origin` (or whatever your remote name is)
[15:25:44] <DaveMethvin> that should get you the latest sizzle
[15:25:50] <DaveMethvin> and then you can build
[15:26:30] <gnarf> ?tell kswedberg ping ping - lookin for you ;)
[15:26:38] * gnarf frowns
[15:26:49] <gnarf> b-ot: tell kswedberg I'm looking for him
[15:26:49] <b-ot> gnarf, I’ll tell kswedberg about that.
[15:26:54] <gnarf> thanks b-ot
[15:27:05] <DaveMethvin> what's with b-ot lately?
[15:27:25] <DaveMethvin> flakey bots make me sad
[15:27:35] <gnarf> ? nlogax and a few others have been working on him-- to replace bot-t
[15:28:54] <DaveMethvin> "to replace bot-t" ... is that like "to serve man" ?
[15:29:12] <DaveMethvin> you're prolly too young to remember that
[15:29:44] <DaveMethvin> twilight zone episode, the aliens said they had a book and all they wanted to do was "to serve man"
[15:29:53] <DaveMethvin> turned out it was a cookbook
[15:30:41] <ajpiano> b-ot: is in his infancy but he is rapidly leveling up in skillz
[15:31:01] <ajpiano> bot-t has some rather strong feelings about him, but he's obviously not around to share them
[15:31:33] <DaveMethvin> ah, the young padwan becomes the jedi
[15:31:52] <ajpiano> yea but right now he is obviously in the hayden christiansen slash everything phase
[15:32:20] <ajpiano> that might mean he is going to turn into darth vader
[15:32:27] <snover> nerds
[15:32:32] <ajpiano> b-ot you are going to turn into darth vader
[15:32:32] <b-ot> ajpiano, no YOU are going to turn into darth vader
[15:32:45] <DaveMethvin> oh snover, like you don't know what we're talking about
[15:32:48] <ajpiano> the horror
[15:33:49] <DaveMethvin> oh gotta go, bbl
[15:35:41] <snover> DaveMethvin: my assessment was still accurate
[17:56:59] <tbranyen> DaveMethvin: around?
[17:57:15] <DaveMethvin> tbranyen: yep
[17:57:42] <tbranyen> DaveMethvin: any word on the async deferred resolve and dropping sync from deferreds?
[17:58:26] <tbranyen> i'm finding myself using sync xhr more and more in local development
[17:58:33] <DaveMethvin> we've committed to supporting $.ajax({ async: false, success: fn, error: fn, complete: fn})
[17:58:46] <DaveMethvin> but have not made a final decision on sync deferred
[17:58:53] <DaveMethvin> so stay with callbacks
[18:01:34] <tbranyen> never
[18:01:38] <tbranyen> but okay :)
[18:08:32] <snover> tbranyen doesn’t understand how to use amd to avoid sync xhr ;)
[18:09:29] * snover runs before he can get another word in edgewise
[18:10:08] <tbranyen> dojo developers
[18:10:15] <tbranyen> i'd be bitter too
