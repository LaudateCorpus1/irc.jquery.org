[06:28:02] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov gnarf: Can one of you take a look at a bad test for jQuery Color?
[06:28:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure the best way to fix this because the test doesn't really make sense to me.
[06:41:36] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov gnarf: I just disabled the test for now. I filed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/issues/69 to make sure it doesn't get lost.
[07:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> I think color just took the lead for most supported version of core: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/tree/master/external

[12:17:38] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: why does it fail in traversing anyway?
[12:17:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah, good question!
[12:18:10] <DaveMethvin> that whole thing is very strange
[12:18:28] <DaveMethvin> which is kinda redundant since we are talking about IE8
[12:18:34] <m_gol> ;)
[12:18:50] <m_gol> I expected sth like that tbh
[12:19:02] <DaveMethvin> really, it's never easy
[12:19:04] <m_gol> if you don't test on IE8 and then suddenly add it, sth must break :D
[12:31:05] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: seems like onload fires too early in IE8 or sth, nothing is added to the document at the moment this check is performed
[12:32:37] <DaveMethvin> definitely very strange, so did you get that output from a manual BrowserStack run?
[12:32:51] <m_gol> yes, when I did it manually
[12:33:12] <JamesMGreene> DaveMethvin: Having trouble reproducing in a fiddle :-\
[12:33:13] <m_gol> console.log(document.documentElement.outerHTML) after doing the selection
[12:39:21] <m_gol> does IE8 not preserve the order of handlers attached to onload? what is happening here O_o
[12:42:51] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: i'm only seeing one test in traversing.js but it says there are 3?
[12:43:32] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: what says about 3?
[12:44:05] <m_gol> I just see the message the number of expected assertions wasn't provided
[12:44:09] <DaveMethvin> http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/8e53af.png
[12:44:29] <m_gol> ah, this
[12:44:43] <m_gol> so, for some reason this global error is handled by QUnit in traversing
[12:44:49] <m_gol> so one additional error
[12:44:54] <DaveMethvin> ah ok
[12:44:54] <m_gol> and another one is about missing expect
[12:45:04] <m_gol> I wouldn't look at component too much here ;)
[12:45:42] <DaveMethvin> definitely seems to be delivering onload after it runs the first test
[12:45:45] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[12:46:01] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if qunit starts the tests using onload
[12:48:53] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: i think it's due to how the jquery files are loaded in the head
[12:49:00] <DaveMethvin> this is what the debugger shows: http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/a5b350.png
[12:49:14] <DaveMethvin> so it actually throws an error before QUnit runs
[12:49:58] <DaveMethvin> its doing a document.write to get the jquery include into the head, which maybe is confusing IE8 somehow
[12:50:43] <DaveMethvin> but in any case this seems to be another test-related problem and not a bug in the actual shipping library
[12:52:38] <m_gol> I don't see this TestManager error
[12:53:34] <DaveMethvin> it's pretty strange that it would crop up, since it's clearly defined in the previous script tag
[12:53:58] <m_gol> yeah
[12:54:36] <m_gol> this shouldn't have anything to do with loading jQuery, though
[12:55:01] <m_gol> ok, I see
[12:55:12] <m_gol> I run it on BrowserStack via a tunnel to my localhost
[12:55:17] <m_gol> where this doc.write is not invoked
[12:55:26] <m_gol> but the error in testinit is still happening
[12:55:48] <DaveMethvin> interesting, i only see the TestManager problem if I use ?module=
[12:56:02] <DaveMethvin> yes, i'm tunneling as well
[12:56:09] <m_gol> ah, ok
[12:56:35] <m_gol> and there isn't a lot of magic there... QUnit creates the HTML structure synchronously via innerHTML in the onload handler and also in the onload handler the code adding select boxes in Migrate is invoked
[12:56:59] <m_gol> so it seems for some reason current configuration causes it to not fire in correct order O_o
[12:57:31] <DaveMethvin> well there's only one answer
[12:57:34] <DaveMethvin> setTimeout
[12:57:58] <DaveMethvin> the answer is always setTimeout or an iframe
[12:58:06] <m_gol> :D
[12:58:06] <DaveMethvin> or is it the problem, i always get confused :)
[12:58:08] <m_gol> lol
[12:58:20] <m_gol> is it not possible to look at the DOM tree in IE8 during debugging?
[12:58:34] <m_gol> I see the "Loading..." text on the HTML tab and refreshing doesn't work
[12:58:41] <DaveMethvin> i don't think so but these dev tools make me want to take a shower
[12:58:44] <m_gol> when I'm on the breakpoint in this line 69
[12:59:07] <m_gol> yeah, I almost forgot how completely fucked up they are
[12:59:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah and the call stack doesn't help either
[13:00:27] <m_gol> works fine with setTimeout obviously
[13:01:07] <m_gol> I hope after patching this one at least test results will be showing properly

[13:04:59] <DaveMethvin> whoo boy, this debugger is just too primitive to even use
[13:05:19] <DaveMethvin> i remember thinking how useful this was ... 10 years ago!
[13:05:35] <m_gol> well, I can imagine this being impressive going from IE7... :P
[13:05:59] <DaveMethvin> it's not much different than the old MS Script Debugger which was an add-on
[13:06:07] <DaveMethvin> and came out in 1997
[13:06:13] <m_gol> it's funny how MS did a great job with DevTools in IE11 and up until IE10 they were all the same crappy ones from IE8
[13:06:40] <DaveMethvin> obviously they CAN do a good job, it's just a matter of resources and priorities
[13:08:27] <m_gol> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1901324
[13:08:35] <m_gol> 2 regular errors left
[13:08:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'll believe that
[13:10:01] <DaveMethvin> on the first test i am guessing it may not be a valid test, it probably assumes that the browser will serialize html sanely

[13:23:36] <m_gol> I hope you'll be able to figure out what's going on here :)(
[13:23:45] <m_gol> I'm happy that we started testing it finally!
[13:23:46] <DaveMethvin> eventually!
[13:24:03] <m_gol> we should add IE6/7 here probably...
[13:24:12] <m_gol> they're in weekly builds so they weren't picked up
[13:24:30] <m_gol> but Migrate doesn't have nearly as many tests as Core so they should actually finish quickly here
[13:24:39] <m_gol> but let's handle IE8 first :)
