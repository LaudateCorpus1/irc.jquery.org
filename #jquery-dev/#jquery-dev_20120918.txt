[07:00:28] <Krinkle|detached> gnarf: Hey
[07:00:47] <Krinkle> gnarf: Is there a docs.jquery.com stage?
[07:00:50] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/81
[07:00:50] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no issue found
[07:01:02] <Krinkle> or is the new host already live?
[07:08:15] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: i think the plan is for docs.jquery.com to be burned to the ground
[07:08:25] <DaveMethvin> its ashes spread across the new sites
[07:08:37] <Krinkle> I know
[07:08:52] <Krinkle> Did you hear about the developer who used tables?
[07:08:54] <Krinkle>  He ended up in a padded cell.
[07:08:55] <Krinkle> :D
[07:09:03] <Krinkle> http://danielcgold.com/thatsafunnyjoke/ (via ShopTalkShow)
[07:09:11] <DaveMethvin> ba dum pum!
[07:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: The new host is already live.
[07:37:25] <johnwards> I posted this up yesterday...but it was rather light on detail. So i've fleshed the info out a lot :)
[07:37:26] <johnwards> https://jqueryuk2013.busyconf.com/proposals/new
[07:55:25] <Krinkle> Hm.. is there a better way to do $foo.find( 'x' ).add( $foo.filter( 'x' ) ); ?
[07:55:40] <Krinkle> i.e. from a plugin act on a selector that is either inside and/or in the selection.
[07:57:15] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: nope, that's the best way
[07:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure there's a feature request for it though.
[07:58:36] <Krinkle> k
[07:58:48] <Krinkle> like maybe passing a parameter to find like 'andSelf'
[07:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there's this: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9800
[07:59:49] <scott_gonzalez> So that gets you a bit closer.
[08:05:00] <Krinkle> Yeah, it would save a reference
[08:05:01] <Krinkle> that's all
[08:05:22] <Krinkle> $foo is effectively the same as the 'previous' stack after the find() call
[08:05:47] <Krinkle> I'd say using $foo is probably more stable since there may be more than one stack shift, right?
[08:06:23] <Krinkle> not sure if that's still the case, but in the past some plugins and core methods use other core methods, as a result there is more than 1 stack shift from a method call on the outside.
[08:06:38] <Krinkle> using add( $foo ) seems more stable
[08:06:53] <Krinkle> or the other way arond
[08:07:14] <Krinkle> $foo.filter( 'img' ).add( $foo.find( 'img' ) ); that looks better imhjo
[09:05:19] <gnarf> Krinkle: there isn't a "staging" one right now
[09:05:19] <bot-t> (3 hours 47 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell gnarf is there any reason in defaultPrefilter to go past this line https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L271 if elem.nodeType !== 1?
[09:05:20] <bot-t> (3 hours 46 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell gnarf, what I mean is… this for is unnecessary https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L307 and this if is as well: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/effects.js#L319 , right?
[09:06:04] <gnarf> ?tell mikesherov probably not
[09:06:04] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[09:06:49] <Krinkle> gnarf: so the Namespace hack is live then?
[09:06:54] <gnarf> Krinkle: yes
[09:06:56] <Krinkle> and old server is gone, and new one is eol13 ?
[09:07:04] <gnarf> i had to kill the old server asap for (mt)
[09:07:14] <gnarf> and the hack seemed stable-ish
[09:07:17] <Krinkle> sure
[09:07:19] <gnarf> so i figured we could move forward with it
[09:07:29] <gnarf> i dunno how much of a pain upgrading mediawiki would be there
[09:07:41] <gnarf> if its too much work, don't worry about it, we plan to kill it anyway
[09:07:51] <Krinkle> not much, fairly easy. though for an old version as the one we run for docs, it would need a little bit of expertise from someone like me
[09:07:54] <Krinkle> but that's a given
[09:08:03] <Krinkle> can you set up a stage area with a copy of it?
[09:08:29] <gnarf> Krinkle: I could - would it be a bad thing to be on the same machine if I make an extra copy of the db?
[09:08:36] <Krinkle> (or help me do it)
[09:08:51] <Krinkle> should be fine, could set it up on a subdomain or even a subdirectory
[09:08:56] <gnarf> yeah
[09:09:08] <gnarf> gonna do stage. right beside the live one in /var/www
[09:09:31] <Krinkle> ok
[09:09:53] <Krinkle> it doesn't do any crazy shell executions, so it being on the same machine is fine
[09:10:11] <gnarf> cool, give me like 30 minutes and ill have that setup
[09:10:17] <Krinkle> awesome
[09:10:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: was also bringing up something that i broke on the docs frontend
[09:10:25] <Krinkle> btw, don't bother copying the www dir
[09:10:33] <Krinkle> just the db and login settings
[09:10:41] <Krinkle> (and subdomain pointer etc.)
[09:10:54] <Krinkle> I'll start clean in the new stage www with a git clone
[09:11:10] <Krinkle> (of mediawiki)
[09:11:34] <Krinkle> then I'll do the configuration similarly and handle the theme html
[09:17:02] <gnarf> Krinkle: same database settings, except there is a jqdocs_stage db
[09:18:17] <gnarf> also, I'm just gonna cp -a docs.jquery.com stage.docs.jquery.com - you can rm whatever you need to
[09:18:29] <gnarf> that way i can make sure the stage is setup right with the old version :)
[09:21:41] <gnarf> Krinkle: stage.docs.jquery.com should be set up
[09:21:57] <Krinkle> alrighty
[09:23:09] <gnarf> just fixed that db access issue, it is def up now :)
[09:40:20] <ryanneufeld> Which airport shoudl I be flying into?
[09:42:33] <ryanneufeld> mikesherov: any idea what airport I'd want to fly into for the conf?
[09:42:54] <mikesherov> um
[09:42:54] <bot-t> (36 mins 40 secs ago) <gnarf> tell mikesherov probably not
[09:43:04] <mikesherov> any DC airport
[09:43:37] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: Dulles is REALLY close
[09:43:59] <ryanneufeld> is that an airport?
[09:44:06] <DaveMethvin> IAD
[09:44:15] <DaveMethvin> that's the airport code
[09:44:45] <mikesherov> OH
[09:44:45] <ryanneufeld> crap, all the flights are over $750
[09:44:59] <mikesherov> ryanneufeld: where do you live?

[09:45:10] <ryanneufeld> west coast
[09:45:16] <mikesherov> oh
[09:45:22] <ryanneufeld> it's a looong flight for me
[09:45:27] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:45:36] <DaveMethvin> IAD should still be a good bet
[09:46:00] <ryanneufeld> Kayak's UX is so bad
[09:46:25] <DaveMethvin> try hipmunk.com
[09:46:28] <DaveMethvin> it's awesome
[09:46:37] <DaveMethvin> still links to kayak for the close
[09:46:42] <DaveMethvin> but the ui is awesome
[09:46:56] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:47:00] <mikesherov> reddit guys made that
[09:47:10] <ryanneufeld> ah
[09:47:47] <ryanneufeld> okay, I think I'm understanding what it showing me
[09:48:06] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: only booking your flight now? yer slackin :)
[09:48:24] <ryanneufeld> Sorry, house was falling apart
[09:48:32] <ryanneufeld> And I may be looking for a job soon
[09:48:34] <ryanneufeld> so yeah...

[09:48:49] <gnarf> carry on
[09:48:50] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[09:48:51] <DaveMethvin> so ryanneufeld no better way to look for a job than to talk to a bunch of people there
[09:48:58] <ryanneufeld> though I am legit looking for a job
[09:49:11] <ryanneufeld> I need a change, and I need to work with people that can teach me things
[09:49:33] <ryanneufeld> So yeah, anyone looking for a PHP/Jquery dude?
[09:49:37] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: want a careers.stackoverflow.com invite? I use it for my resume :)
[09:49:48] <DaveMethvin> are you looking at the $749 United flight ryanneufeld? that one seems pretty good
[09:50:02] <ryanneufeld> http://www.hipmunk.com/flights/YVR-to-IAD#!dates=Oct14,Oct18'
[09:50:04] <ryanneufeld> http://www.hipmunk.com/flights/YVR-to-IAD#!dates=Oct14,Oct18

[09:51:46] <DaveMethvin> 777 for a red eye
[09:51:56] <DaveMethvin> with two stops
[09:52:03] <ryanneufeld> boourns
[09:52:09] <DaveMethvin> you'd better get TWO bags of nuts at that price
[09:52:19] <mikesherov> ryanneufeld: what are you looking to do?
[09:52:22] <mikesherov> SNAP is hiring
[09:52:37] <ryanneufeld> mikesherov: build cool shit
[09:52:41] <mikesherov> the company I'm lead dev at
[09:52:54] <ryanneufeld> does it do ad sales?
[09:53:04] <mikesherov> is JS/frontend your main bag, or backend, or ops?
[09:53:10] <mikesherov> it does not do ad sales
[09:53:13] <ryanneufeld> I can do it all
[09:53:17] <mikesherov> we make a large scale dating app
[09:53:19] <ryanneufeld> I'm very comfortable on the cli
[09:53:28] <mikesherov> 500K+ daily visitors
[09:53:30] <ryanneufeld> I can write JS code pretty well
[09:53:45] <mikesherov> mongo/hadoop/solr/mysql/memcache js/css/html/php
[09:54:04] <ryanneufeld> I've used all but the second and third of those
[09:54:11] <mikesherov> cool
[09:54:14] <mikesherov> are you looking to move?
[09:54:36] <ryanneufeld> I'd prefer not to, but travel isn't out of the question
[09:55:10] <mikesherov> Yeah, it's NYC based, so unless you'd be willing to move, I can't help you :-\
[09:55:26] <mikesherov> but if we were willing, I have spots available for an awesome guy like you
[09:55:35] <ryanneufeld> D'aww
[09:55:37] <ryanneufeld> shucks
[09:55:56] <ryanneufeld> well, maybe a more serious talk could make someone willing :p
[09:56:02] <mikesherov> sure
[09:56:14] <mikesherov> well, we can talk at the hackathon
[09:56:18] <gnarf> did you graduate college btw? :)
[09:56:29] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: cuz otherwise getting an american work visa is a bitch
[09:56:30] <mikesherov> you don't need to be a college grad to work at SNAP
[09:56:35] <mikesherov> true
[09:56:37] <mikesherov> true
[09:56:44] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, I have a bachelors degree
[09:59:36] <ryanneufeld> oh, for expensly, I just sign up?
[10:00:05] <gnarf> yup
[10:00:19] <gnarf> then forward your receipt to the receipts@expensify.com
[10:00:23] <gnarf> and it will process it
[10:00:32] <gnarf> then add it to a "report" and send it to expenses@jquery.com
[10:00:52] <ryanneufeld> okay
[10:00:53] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[10:01:21] <ryanneufeld> I just dropped a line to my mum, sometimes she can get free standby passes through alaska air
[10:05:19] <ryanneufeld> Well, if anyone knows anyone on the west coast looking for a dev, lemme know
[10:28:44] <stevecrozz> ryanneufeld: is this you? http://ryanneufeld.net/
[10:33:54] <ryanneufeld> yes, that is
[10:34:16] <ryanneufeld> or it should be, looks like my DNS needs up dating
[10:34:18] <ryanneufeld> :S
[10:36:00] <ryanneufeld> stevecrozz: yes, that is me, though it's down atm. I'll have to update it later
[10:46:09] <Krinkle> gnarf: what else is running on eol3? Can I just go ahead and apt-get a bunch of stuff?
[10:46:12] <Krinkle> (I need git-core for example)
[10:48:36] <Krinkle> okay, looks safe.
[11:21:30] <gnarf> Krinkle: yeah - install whatever
[11:21:32] <gnarf> it also has plugins.jquery.com

[13:15:52] <ryanneufeld> wait to go DaveMethvin you broke it again!
[13:16:29] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: naw, it's just swarmy being swarmy: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/825
[13:16:58] <ryanneufeld> me shakes fist at IE7
[13:18:00] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/243887
[13:18:04] <Krinkle> likely browserstack snafu
[13:18:08] <Krinkle> 1 hour ago
[13:18:36] <Krinkle> I bet that VM has been buried alive
[13:18:52] <Krinkle> testswarm can detect that and give it another try in a fresh vm, I haven't had time to implement that, but its a known bug
[13:19:00] <Krinkle> I've manually reset that table cell, should be there in a minute
[13:20:39] <DaveMethvin> thanks Krinkle, since it all seemed to succed i wasn't too worried
[13:22:05] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: question for you if you have a second
[13:22:14] <DaveMethvin> sure johnbender
[13:22:19] <johnbender> I got another answer from snover but I wanted to double check with you
[13:22:36] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: propfix and the toLowerCase call in $.fn.prop and $.fn.attr
[13:23:08] <johnbender> the purpose of propfix appears to be to normalize inconsistent properties from different browsers
[13:23:34] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: for attr, is it just a convencience thing?
[13:23:40] <johnbender> ugh
[13:23:46] <johnbender> * convenience
[13:24:03] <DaveMethvin> we use it to fix several compat issues with oldIE in particular johnbender
[13:24:05] <johnbender> also I think that fits with what snover was saying
[13:24:11] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: propfix?
[13:24:14] <johnbender> or toLowerCase
[13:24:32] <johnbender> or both
[13:24:33] <DaveMethvin> propfix and attrfix
[13:25:00] <johnbender> is there an attrfix? I thought it just downcases when "notxml"
[13:25:06] * johnbender goes to look
[13:25:12] <snover> DaveMethvin: propfix sure looks like something to fix people typing "tabindex" with prop when they mean "tabIndex"
[13:25:17] <snover> not an oldie fix
[13:25:35] <johnbender> snover: well there's at least one attribute that's not a camelcase conversion
[13:25:46] <snover> there is one property that is wrapped in a feature detect.
[13:25:53] <johnbender> for: "htmlFor"
[13:26:01] <johnbender> though again, that may just be convenience
[13:26:03] <johnbender> this is why I'm asking
[13:26:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's propfix not attrfix
[13:26:15] <DaveMethvin> but what was the question again?
[13:26:23] <johnbender> is the purpose purely convenience
[13:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> propfix is lowercase attribute name -> property name, isn't it?
[13:26:36] <johnbender> ie, I can use prop( "for" ) instead of prop( "htmlFor" )
[13:27:13] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: that might make sense since attr delegates to prop when getAttribute isn't defined
[13:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Yes, though you should probably use .prop( "htmlFor" ) if you really care about the property.
[13:27:59] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: and that property consistently manifests as htmlFor across browsers?
[13:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:28:13] <DaveMethvin> if it goes through propfix, yes
[13:28:27] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: DaveMethvin: then it sounds like prop( "for" ) is just shorthand
[13:29:03] <DaveMethvin> i don't like the term shorthand
[13:29:23] <DaveMethvin> the standard property for "for" is htmlFor, right?
[13:29:24] <timmywil> johnbender: it is there for back-compat. the property is htmlFor
[13:29:55] <johnbender> timmywil: but newer browsers expose "for" ?
[13:30:10] <timmywil> not to my knowledge
[13:30:25] <johnbender> timmywil: so that means that being able to use "for" is just convenience unless I'm missing something
[13:30:36] <DaveMethvin> brb
[13:30:49] <johnbender> sorry to be stirring the pot here I'm just curious
[13:30:51] <timmywil> not many people know that the property is "htmlFor"
[13:30:56] <johnbender> I don't want to steal work time from you guys
[13:31:08] <johnbender> timmywil: ah, so it's an important convenvience
[13:31:14] <johnbender> that makes sense
[13:32:42] <timmywil> because the attribute is "for", you might think the property would also be called "for"
[13:33:05] <timmywil> so we cover for you
[13:33:31] <timmywil> which is convenient, but I wouldn't call it shorthand
[13:33:56] <timmywil> the user is actually doing something wrong, we just don't tell them about it
[13:34:13] <johnbender> timmywil: ah! I forgot about the for attr
[13:34:15] <johnbender> I see
[13:34:21] <johnbender> that makes _perfect_ sense
[13:34:27] <johnbender> the delegation to prop requires it
[13:34:38] <johnbender> which fits with what scott_gonzalez was saying
[13:34:39] <timmywil> cool :)
[13:34:43] * johnbender enlightenment
[13:34:55] <johnbender> timmywil: many thanks
[13:35:01] <timmywil> np!
