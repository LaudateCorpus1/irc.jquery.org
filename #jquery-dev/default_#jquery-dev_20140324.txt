[10:35:50] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: lol @ "m_gol points out we're failing tests on IE4 (inline block)"
[11:02:42] <m_gol> pretty green http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[11:27:58] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: you here?
[11:28:08] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: yep
[11:28:19] <m_gol> I see the Chicago conf dates are set up
[11:28:29] <m_gol> is the team participation there confirmed?
[11:28:31] <DaveMethvin> yep
[11:28:40] <DaveMethvin> its over a weekend
[11:28:52] <m_gol> bc I'm wondering about tickets
[11:29:17] <DaveMethvin> oh like for someone else?
[11:29:27] <m_gol> it should be cheaper to buy them now than later
[11:29:30] <m_gol> I mean plane tickets ;)
[11:29:34] <DaveMethvin> oh
[11:29:44] <DaveMethvin> usually it's not bad until 2 months or so beforehand
[11:29:48] <m_gol> k
[11:30:08] <DaveMethvin> but that's a good point, i'll talk to kborchers about when we should ask the team to make plane reservations
[11:30:17] <m_gol> I'm also not sure yet if my gf wouldn't like to come to Chicago around that date & that would change when I want to arrive/go back
[11:30:43] <m_gol> so I try to be on top where we are with booking decisions ;)
[11:30:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah thanks
[11:33:31] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: btw, don't get fooled by all this green in testswarm. that's me restarting jobs :P
[11:33:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah i've been doing that too to make it look pretty and be sure it's a random fail
[11:35:00] <m_gol> even IE8 starts cooperating
[11:35:03] <m_gol> sometimes
[11:57:35] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15mzgol opened pull request #546: Build: switch from the "popular" browser set to "popular-qunit" (06master...06testswarm) 02http://git.io/cMOnAw
