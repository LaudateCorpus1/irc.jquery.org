[08:15:33] <tbranyen> dang jauborg isn't around :-/
[08:15:45] <tbranyen> been trying to think of the best way to have an ajaxAbortAll
[08:15:50] <tbranyen> i think my code is kind of messy using prefilters
[08:16:03] <danheberden> more like ajaxAubourgAll
[08:16:26] <tbranyen> heh i should call it taht
[08:18:45] <DaveMethvin> lol

[09:13:51] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez: do you see anything wrong with the proposed solution here? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/195/files
[09:13:52] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on qunit by conzett (1w, 6d ago): Change QUnit fixture reset behavior
[09:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> Seems fine, though I wonder if it will break anyone's code.
[09:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> Stored references to #qunit-fixture will die.
[09:19:01] <jzaefferer> Yeah, though sharing that reference across tests would be odd anyway.
[09:19:10] <danzik171> tbranyen: your abort all thing looked interesting, so here's my take  :  http://jsfiddle.net/UQ89H/1/
[09:19:10] <jzaefferer> Never seen that, though doesn't mean no one is doing it
[09:19:50] <jzaefferer> Reminds me, apparently someone was recommendating `same` at the lunch talk on QUnit at jQuery UK m(
[09:20:04] <jzaefferer> I should just switch to throwing an error if you still use that
[09:20:23] <jzaefferer> There's releases now, and its easy to create a custom alias
[09:20:35] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think anyone would be doing it inside tests, maybe in wrappers around the tests though.
[09:21:32] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's probably fine to land it.

[09:28:18] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez: outerHTML? That's not available in Firefox is it?
[09:29:23] <tbranyen> danzik171: turns out ajaxAbortAll is relatively useless
[09:29:28] <tbranyen> data still comes back from the server
[09:29:29] <tbranyen> :-/
[09:29:34] <tbranyen> when using jsonp
[09:29:39] <sindresorhus> DaveMethvin: Firefox 11+
[09:29:49] <tbranyen> can't abort that
[09:30:07] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: seems fine in FF10
[09:30:21] <jzaefferer> checking 3.6 now
[09:30:36] <jzaefferer> working fine as well
[09:30:46] <tbranyen> danzik171: hrm but it works great without jsonp
[09:31:15] <DaveMethvin> since jsonp is just a script tag there's no way to "abort" it, you can only flag it to be ignored if/when it arrives
[09:31:23] <DaveMethvin> but it is still using up a connection :(
[09:32:56] <DaveMethvin> sindresorhus jzaefferer: document.getElementsByTagName("body")[0].outerHTML returns undefined for me in FF10

[09:34:33] <jq-jenkins> conzett: Change fixture reset behavior
[09:34:36] <sindresorhus> DaveMethvin:
[09:34:37] <sindresorhus> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.outerHTML#section_6
[09:36:01] <DaveMethvin> ok, good to see the official word sindresorhus
[09:36:17] <danzik171> tbranyen: looks like your use cache was just for auto-caching of results tho, or was that just added in for fun?
[09:36:24] <DaveMethvin> now if we could just drop ff3.6 support...
[09:36:48] <jzaefferer> maybe the unit test doesn't cover that particular case...
[09:36:57] <tbranyen> danzik171: i extracted that from an app that was caching yea
[09:37:43] <jzaefferer> yeah, that runs only when jQuery is included, which isn't the case in the QUnit testsuite
[09:38:56] <DaveMethvin> well it's gonna break for us :D
[09:40:38] <jzaefferer> so the seperate path, that was using jQuery's html method, was intended to clean up event handlers and whatever else html() is doing
[09:41:21] <jzaefferer> the non-jQuery path is using fixture.cloneNode(true), dunno if that should be cloneNode(false) and if that would be safe to use for the jQuery path as well
[09:41:59] <DaveMethvin> all the .data() would potentially get messed up tho
[09:42:50] <jzaefferer> so assuming the copy we get before any tests are run is good, what would be a safe method to keep copying that?
[09:43:52] <DaveMethvin> i'd need to think about that ... we have some checks for leaks,  I think each test should do its own manual cleanup so perhaps just clobbering it would not be so bad
[09:53:01] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: let me know if you come up with something else, for now this fixes it in Firefox when jQuery is loaded: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/3571d657837925cef694bd8e8b7d37efa439ec10
[09:53:17] <jzaefferer> I'm not sure we even need that branch, I think it was mostly to fix things in the jQuery testsuite itself

[14:56:04] <mikesherov> so, this PR for warning about using file:// is funny
[14:56:05] <bot-t> (19 hours 50 mins ago) <DaveMethvin> tell mikesherov I think it will be at least another month before Chrome beats IE, but yes most likely on a weekend.
[14:56:50] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I'm not really worrying if the tests fail... just that the tests that file:// and PHP are present fail
[14:59:26] <mikesherov> .
[16:17:23] <shichuan> what is the impact of sunsetting jquery-tmpl?
[17:40:12] <rwaldron> ?darius is Might as well be clownpenis.fart.
[17:40:14] <bot-t> rwaldron, Couldn't find "darius is Might as well be clownpenis.fart." in jQuery Docs.
[17:40:24] <rwaldron> bot-t: darius is Might as well be clownpenis.fart.
[17:40:24] <bot-t> rwaldron, Stored "darius".
[17:40:26] <rwaldron> nice
[19:49:07] <rtgibbons> seems bugs.jquery.com is down, mysql issues, my new ssh key isn't in place so I can't do anything about it
[19:49:24] <ajpiano> it's been really problematic today :|
[19:50:31] <rtgibbons> yeah, it's been problematic for months :/
