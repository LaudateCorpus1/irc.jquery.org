[01:08:35] <JamesMGreene> OK, I'm spent
[01:09:53] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle|detached jzaefferer: All 3 of the [formerly] bundled QUnit assertion plugins have been extracted to my GitHub account. I need one of you (or someone else) to deploy the latest master branch of the "qunitjs.com" repo to reflect my changes to the "plugins" page, though. Can someone take care of that today? Thanks!
[01:10:07] <JamesMGreene> 3:10am, sheesh... took longer than expected
[05:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreeneAway: There is no problem with changing the maintainer. Note that you do NOT own the code now, you're just maintaining it. AUTHORS.txt should not be modified (except to add new authors).
[14:43:44] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Thanks, nice work!

[15:39:07] <Krinkle> Now I need to migrate the database. Ugh...
[19:31:53] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle|detached scott_gonzalez: Anyone around to deploy the latest qunitjs.com site?
[19:32:49] <ajpiano> JamesMGreene: do you have commit access to qunitjs.com ?
[19:33:13] <ajpiano> if so... commit a semver tag using npm version
[19:33:25] <ajpiano> if not.... i'm getting off the train, can help you when i get to my destination!!
[19:33:34] <JamesMGreene> ajpiano: Yes, I do
[19:35:12] <JamesMGreene> ajpiano: Not sure I understand, would love some guidance when you are back on
[20:18:30] <ajpiano> JamesMGreene: the way that sites are deployed is that you do a git tag with a semantic version number
[20:18:36] <ajpiano> but the best way to do that is with "npm version"
[20:18:48] <ajpiano> https://npmjs.org/doc/version.html
[20:19:07] <ajpiano> so basically, assuming  everything on stage.qunitjs.com is copasetic
[20:19:23] <ajpiano> you can just "npm version patch && git push && git push --tags"
[20:20:41] <ajpiano> npm version bumps the version in the package.json, does a git commit, and makes the tag
[20:50:38] <JamesMGreene> ajpiano: I think you forgot to mention actually creating a tag, right?
[20:51:35] <JamesMGreene> oh, nm
[20:51:37] <JamesMGreene> "If run in a git repo, it will also create a version commit and tag, and fail if the repo is not clean."
[20:52:25] <JamesMGreene> ajpiano: Why do `&& git push && git push --tags` vs. just `&& git push --tags`?
[20:58:19] <JamesMGreene> ajpiano: Thanks! Updated: http://qunitjs.com/plugins/
[22:24:34] <kborchers> welcome s5fs :)
