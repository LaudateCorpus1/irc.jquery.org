[03:30:53] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Does anybody know what version of phantomjs and what version of npm is running the tests at http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/ ?
[03:30:53] <bot-t> (6 hours 27 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ I don't dictate teh versions there, I could check them and let you know
[08:32:46] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: um
[08:33:23] <gnarf> gnarf@jq03:~$ npm -v
[08:33:23] <gnarf> 1.1.61
[08:33:23] <gnarf> gnarf@jq03:~$ phantomjs -v
[08:33:24] <gnarf> 1.6.1
[08:33:47] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: is there a version issue? (i'm going to sleep btw, but will catch your message in the morning)
[08:38:38] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: where are we on the plugin site? this guy might be a good test case for the "how to get your plugin listed" process. http://www.reddit.com/r/jquery/comments/1329oc/open_sourcing_my_jquery_plugins_looking_for_advice/
[08:39:28] <gnarf>  /cc scott_gonzalez: ^^^^
[08:55:19] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I have a lunch meeting today. Can't make the meeting. I'll review IRC to know what I missed.
[08:55:32] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks mikesherov
[09:03:13] <snover> DaveMethvin: i canâ€™t make it either
[09:03:26] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:03:33] <snover> sry :()
[09:09:23] <FJ> is there a release date for 1.8.3?
[09:10:55] <gnarf> FJ: very soon - DaveMethvin said "today?" about 5 mintues ago in #jquery-meeting ;)
[09:11:57] <FJ> wow. thx!
[09:37:53] <DaveMethvin> okay, be back soon
[10:17:38] <jzaefferer> _|Nix|_: https://gist.github.com/7bf03779477099fde1c7
[11:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: 1.8.3 today?
[11:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> I need to track down a failure first.
[11:30:36] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, 1.8.3 probably doesn't have the fail, but it'd be good to be able to test UI against the code that's about to ship.
[11:38:31] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: the head of 1.8-stable is our candidate, I don't plan to add anything
[11:40:02] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:30:52] <_|Nix|_> jzaefferer: Thanks! Any chance that could be upgraded to phantomjs 1.7.0 and npm 1.1.65?
[12:34:18] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_ jzaefferer gnarf: We should get all of our servers on node 0.8.14, which will get us on npm 1.1.65.
[12:35:16] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, that's how I got there on my local machine as well.
