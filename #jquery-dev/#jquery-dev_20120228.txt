[08:24:57] <danheberden> has the bugs server been more cooperative for y'all?
[08:56:56] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: it does seem like the bug server has been less, er, buggy the last coupla days
[08:57:06] <DaveMethvin> but now i've jinxed it no doubt!
[08:57:10] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[08:57:16] <danheberden> i did some table work to help the reports out
[08:57:38] <danheberden> which seems to be helping resources so it doesn't shit it's pants every time you want to, you know, look at tickets
[08:57:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah it doesn't seem as skittish

[09:41:34] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[09:41:43] <timmywil> oi
[09:41:55] <DaveMethvin> do you remember why i closed that ticket on $.extend?
[09:42:08] <DaveMethvin> was that after the 1.8 vote?
[09:42:52] <DaveMethvin> you had reopened it
[09:43:11] <timmywil> we discussed it. I think it was decided that it wasn't worth fixing.
[09:43:22] <DaveMethvin> ok, i just couldn't remember
[09:43:39] <DaveMethvin> i think it's fine as is
[09:43:40] <timmywil> I mean, I'm still alright with changing it, but it would change behavior
[09:43:48] <DaveMethvin> really it's a horrible api choice no matter what
[09:44:10] <DaveMethvin> i should have noted our discussion when closing it ... gotta remember to do that in the future
[09:44:22] <timmywil> rwaldron might remember
[09:47:27] <rwaldron> which ticket?
[09:47:35] <rwaldron> was it "false" for a first param?
[09:48:19] <timmywil> rwaldron: yup
[09:49:41] <rwaldron> IIRC, we determined that because that signature was _never_ supported, never documented as such
[09:50:03] <rwaldron> that it was completely unnec to add code that handled `false`
[09:50:21] <rwaldron> when simply _not_ passing anything already does that
[09:50:31] <rwaldron> also, there were issues with the implementation
[09:50:44] <rwaldron> there is a really fragile code path for recursive extend calls
[09:50:58] <rwaldron> also, did I mention it's effing pointless.
[09:50:59] <rwaldron> ?
[10:51:14] <tbranyen> rworth: is this a better place to discuss jquery-ui stuff?
[10:51:22] <rworth> #jqueryui-dev
[10:51:27] <rworth> now we're up to 4 :)
[14:09:14] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez Krinkle wwalser DaveMethvin rwaldron: One of these days I'd like to get together with you to review the open QUnit issues. Your input would help a lot. There's mostly feature requests now, so your priorities can shape where things are moving.
[14:09:15] <bot-t> (3 hours 31 mins ago) <kborchers> tell jzaefferer saw your comments on the menu docs. hope to get that squared away tonight. other than the todo's for menu on the wiki, any thoughts on where i should focus next for 1.9?
[14:09:34] <rwaldron> jzaefferer definitely
[14:09:40] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Hey
[14:09:47] <rwaldron> maybe you can coordinate an IRC meeting in the near future
[14:09:54] <Krinkle> Yes please
[14:10:02] <jzaefferer> there's just 15 open issues: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues
[14:10:14] <Krinkle> I'm in a meeting right now (2), brb
[14:10:17] <Krinkle> in 1-2 hours
[14:10:33] <jzaefferer> looking through should only take a few minutes. Though an irc meeting would probably help!
[14:10:49] <jzaefferer> ya, not today
[14:11:25] <jzaefferer> how about noon EST on Thursday in #jquery-meeting?
[14:12:32] <jzaefferer> I'll also invite John Bender
[14:27:59] <jzaefferer> wwalser Krinkle: Don't have your email addresses - will be doing a QUnit IRC meeting on Thursday, noon EST
[14:28:11] <Krinkle> krinklemail@gmail.com
[16:00:43] <eddiemonge> anyone know why the code for minified files is split around 33k characters?
[16:01:51] <johnbender> jzaefferer: any idea how I can add DaveMethvin to the jquerymobile.com repo - he wants to work on the perf pages we've got set up
[16:01:57] <johnbender> or at least see them
[16:02:07] <johnbender> and it appears I can only add teams and not individuals
[16:03:06] <jzaefferer> johnbender: what's the repo?
[16:04:01] <DaveMethvin> jquerymobile.com
[16:04:35] <eddiemonge> DaveMethvin: you should have access now
[16:04:48] <DaveMethvin> yay! thanks!
[16:05:06] <johnbender> eddiemonge: what did you end up doing?
[16:05:08] <DaveMethvin> wow, like magic
[16:05:16] <eddiemonge> johnbender: added him to the jQuery Mobile Admin team
[16:05:23] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ah
[16:05:32] <johnbender> I'm glad I asked then
[16:05:34] <johnbender> thanks!
[16:05:50] <eddiemonge> where you add the teams, you can click on the team name to go to that team
[16:05:54] <eddiemonge> then you can add members there
[16:07:42] <DaveMethvin> so its "add member to team" not "add team to member"
[16:08:48] <eddiemonge> DaveMethvin: you are your own team
[16:09:08] <eddiemonge> one of you is equal to all of us
[16:09:10] <DaveMethvin> was it my aftershave?
[16:10:26] <nFFF> Theres some real issues with form submission on click events o other handlers apart from the <input submit> button
[16:12:16] <DaveMethvin> nFFF: http://jsFiddle.net/{yourTestCaseHere}
[16:12:55] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/A4XaV/15/
[16:13:05] <nFFF> No data is sent
[16:13:25] <nFFF> Here is the work around: http://jsfiddle.net/A4XaV/17/
[16:13:58] <nFFF> hide the input button, and trigger it with a click, when the new custom button is clicked
[16:14:40] <DaveMethvin> can you reduce the html?
[16:15:25] <eddiemonge> and maybe provide valid html?
[16:16:07] <DaveMethvin> eddiemonge: you are such a dreamer
[16:16:21] <eddiemonge> i know right?!
[16:16:52] <eddiemonge> i always have my forms have method="POST" method="POST" just in case one isnt enough
[16:28:10] <nFFF> Its not my html
[16:28:20] <nFFF> I was just helping someone solve this in the main jQuery channel
[16:29:26] <nFFF> Its documented here also: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/142000/jquery-override-form-submit-not-working-when-submit-called-by-javascript-on-a-el
[16:29:47] <Krinkle> Additionally certain types of "deep" selectors won't work correctly, such as: "body > div span" or "div + div span" (note the > or + followed by a " " selector). We hope to resolve this in the rewrite.
[16:29:50] <Krinkle> </unquote>
[16:29:58] <Krinkle> http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix
[16:30:01] <Krinkle> what is the " " selector ?
[16:30:08] <Krinkle> seems like something went missing
[16:30:27] <Krinkle> I only see a space
[16:33:15] <eddiemonge> nFFF: im still not seeing the problem. that example you have is submitting the form from what i see
[19:43:34] <mikesherov> .
[19:55:41] <kswedberg> .
[19:59:14] <mikesherov> .
[20:00:20] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: can you give me an overview of what situations we can a ticket as "needsreview"
[20:01:02] <mikesherov> I went to review a lot of the "triage" tickets, and they don't really look like most of them needs review
[20:01:09] <DaveMethvin> we don't have formal rules, and tbh we haven't used it for probably  a year
[20:01:25] <mikesherov> interesting
[20:01:29] <DaveMethvin> for a while we'd mark them and then ask everyone to review them before a mtg
[20:01:40] <DaveMethvin> then we all got lazy :D
[20:01:50] <mikesherov> LOL
[20:01:55] <mikesherov> so was it not helpful or something?
[20:02:05] <DaveMethvin> at this point we don't have that many unique hard tickets
[20:02:18] <DaveMethvin> but if you think one needs discussing we could just put it on the agenda
[20:02:21] <DaveMethvin> for a meeting
[20:02:30] <mikesherov> no, not really
[20:02:33] <DaveMethvin> or send someting to jquery-bugs-team
[20:02:44] <mikesherov> I just see "triage team: unreviewed tickets" at the top of IRC
[20:02:50] <mikesherov> and I periodically review them for new stuff
[20:03:06] <mikesherov> I just am obsessed with clearing out lists
[20:03:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah i need to get on that too
[20:03:14] <mikesherov> and that seems like a list needing clearing
[20:03:26] <DaveMethvin> there are a few tix i need to get for 1.7.2
[20:03:35] <mikesherov> Yeah
[20:04:01] <mikesherov> but I mean, if those tix no longer need review, do I then just go and classify them and then remove needsreview?
[20:04:11] <DaveMethvin> sure
[20:04:16] <mikesherov> or should I leave that to you at this point?
[20:04:29] <DaveMethvin> no. let's be sure it gets done :D
[20:04:36] <DaveMethvin> so you do it
[20:04:43] <mikesherov> OK, I'd like to run them by you... email the best way?
[20:04:54] <mikesherov> to jquery-bugs-team?
[20:05:05] <DaveMethvin> the list sounds good to me
[20:05:17] <mikesherov> ok, will do.
[20:05:20] <mikesherov> thanks
[20:05:24] <mikesherov> have a nice night
[20:05:29] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
