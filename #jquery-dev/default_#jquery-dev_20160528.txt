[02:13:15] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core Periodic build #375: UNSTABLE in 17 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%20Periodic/375/
[20:53:05] <platinumazure> Hi folks. I have an ESLint plugin for QUnit that is nearing maturity (https://github.com/platinumazure/eslint-plugin-qunit); would anyone mind taking a look at it to see if there are useful rules or enhancements to be made?
[20:53:40] <platinumazure> It could also pay off for the QUnit project itself, if they were to switch to ESLint (JSCS and ESLint combined forces recently, after all) and use the plugin.
[20:54:12] <platinumazure> And it could pay off for any jQuery projects that test with QUnit, which I assume is "basically all of them". :-)
[20:59:29] <platinumazure> Any questions, feel free to stop by the gitter chat. I'll try to keep an eye on this channel too just in case. Have a good weekend, folks.
