[05:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> What an awesome backlog :-)
[07:46:33] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Where do you see a spec saying that IDs aren't unique? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12893#comment:3
[07:46:53] <timmywil> one sec, I'll find it
[07:53:24] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: my world is being rocked. I could have sworn I read in the spec that IDs are not restricted to uniqueness, but now I don't see it anywhere.
[07:53:29] * timmywil lets it go
[07:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:53:52] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps in a CSS spec?
[07:54:05] <timmywil> perhaps
[07:54:08] <scott_gonzalez> In HTML/DOM, it's certainly required to be unique.
[07:54:19] <timmywil> yea, seems that way
[08:03:19] <snover> there are some multiple-IDs-per-DOM hacks that people have been known to use for various selectory activity
[08:03:24] <snover> but they are not valid
[09:11:49] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: if you create the repo and grant me access, I'll push the clone
[09:12:37] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Hm.. what about past issues though
[09:12:40] <Krinkle> maybe move it github-side?
[09:12:44] <Krinkle> https://github.com/clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack/issues/29
[09:12:44] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #29 on testswarm-browserstack (gnarf37; 3m, 6d ago): Move repo to jquery/testswarm-browserstack
[09:12:59] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: ah, right, Clark can actually to the move
[09:13:26] <Krinkle> Maybe bump that issue.
[09:14:09] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: done, thanks. Good find.

[19:24:38] <pbramos> Looking to define expectations of a fix for bug #4087
[21:02:09] <pbramos> Now, curious what people's thoughts are on changing function signatures for functions like .clean() and .domManip()
