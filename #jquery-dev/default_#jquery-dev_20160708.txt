[13:18:53] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15gibson042 opened pull request #1020: Core: Improve internal async handling (06master...062016-07-improve-async) 02https://git.io/vK34i
[13:26:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#callback-invocation we're getting a question about the language "If you are currently using .then(), you may only receive a single argument in your handler." against https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/30mj99rd/6/
[13:27:26] <robertmaxrees> does that language mean that the library itself will only ever pass one arg to the callback for .then()?  or will a limit be imposed eventually?
[13:36:08] <DaveMethvin> robertmaxrees: yeah we could probably clarify that a bit. If you use ONLY jQuery's Deferred it should pass all the args from a resolve but if you start mixing Promise impls the args are truncated to the first
[13:36:28] <DaveMethvin> e.g. https://jsfiddle.net/30mj99rd/7/
[13:36:47] <DaveMethvin> so expecting multiple args isn't a good idea
[13:37:04] <DaveMethvin> especially if you're not sure whether promise/a+ impls will be mixed
[13:38:49] <DaveMethvin> so perhaps s/If you are currently using .then()/If you mix Promise/A+ implementations in your code/
[13:39:40] <DaveMethvin> paging gibson0421 gibson042 for his opinion
[13:49:26] <robertmaxrees> that's really awesome info.
[13:49:34] <robertmaxrees> Thanks a ton!
[15:04:07] <gibson042> I'm late to the party, but what's up?
[15:04:15] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: ^
[15:04:41] <DaveMethvin> see the q above from robert about deferred
[15:08:44] <gibson042> robertmaxrees: Dave's information is correct. We currently pass all arguments, but that's coloring outside the lines and we may need to change the policy in order to remain compliant at some point.
[15:09:32] <DaveMethvin> i can update the guide to clarify
[15:12:37] <gibson042> I suppose multiple arguments are _practically_ deprecated, but not officially so
