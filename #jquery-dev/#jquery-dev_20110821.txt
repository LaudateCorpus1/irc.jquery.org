[16:21:08] <rwaldron> danheberden thanks for adding sizzle :)
[16:21:20] <danheberden> of course :)
[16:23:29] <rwaldron> rose thought she lost a $500 apple gift card in the move
[16:24:18] <rwaldron> she was really bummed and was nervous about explaining it to her folks, who got it for her after she bought her mom an iMac
[16:24:24] <rwaldron> (used)
[16:24:36] <rwaldron> anyway... i found it today
[16:25:05] <rwaldron> and I went out and picked up an iPad 2 for her (which was the point of the gift card to begin with)
[16:25:16] <rwaldron> she's gonna be stoked
[17:01:41] <danheberden> bot-t: tell rwaldron I hope rose like's her surprise dude! You're crafty!
[17:01:42] <bot-t> danheberden, Okay.
