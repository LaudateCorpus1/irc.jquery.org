[10:00:45] <markelog> don't mind me, m_gol )
[10:02:06] <m_gol> ok ;) I'll land everything mine except the XHR stuff then (just with the 2232 update for all browsers)

[14:05:29] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: seems migrate just got its build broken ;)
[14:06:03] <DaveMethvin> well at least I did *something* today :/
[14:06:35] <m_gol> :)
[14:07:08] <Krinkle> It works with 1.9+ but fails with 1.6-1.8
[14:07:13] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/432
[14:07:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's a legit fail!
[14:07:30] <Krinkle> "default context gets updated to latest promise in the chain"
[14:07:31] <Krinkle> Ha
[14:07:32] <Krinkle> Yeah
[14:07:54] <DaveMethvin> it's because I pulled over some unit tests from core that don't apply there
[14:08:01] <Krinkle> Would it be feasible to preserve the original .pipe if present (but still wrap with a warning)
[14:08:12] <DaveMethvin> that's what i did originally
[14:08:30] <DaveMethvin> but i talked it over with gibson042 and decided to always replace it
[14:08:45] <DaveMethvin> so i may go back to plan A
[14:09:16] <DaveMethvin> no biggee
[14:12:42] <Krinkle> col
[14:12:43] <Krinkle> cool
[14:16:24] <m_gol> I was looking at our .css('width') hooks; apart from allowing us to measure detached elements they also prevent us from getting fractional values that are available via gCS; pretty crazy :)
[14:19:13] <m_gol> hopefully this will work fine with getBoundingClientRect but it'll increase the size further, we'll still need workarounds for IE9 etc.
[14:20:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah gBCR is slower as well i think
[14:20:12] <m_gol> I was looking at the history of this code and it goes back very far in the past
[14:20:25] <m_gol> I think I found traces of special handling of .css('width') in 2009 or sth ;)
[14:21:18] <m_gol> this code already adds 337 bytes gzipped and it will now have a second code path added... well, I'll need to run some benchmarks
[14:22:03] <DaveMethvin> oh but don't you know? jQuery is just a simple wrapper around querySelectorAll
[14:22:08] <m_gol> ;)
[14:23:03] <m_gol> I see duplication in augmentWidthOrHeight, though, maybe it can be compressed
[16:20:37] <scott_gonzalez> markelog: ping
[17:46:28] <snover> kborchers DaveMethvin gentlemen.
[17:46:43] <snover> throw me a bone!
[17:48:06] <DaveMethvin> snover: wazzup?
[17:48:20] <snover> i sent two email replies now with no response :)
[17:49:05] <DaveMethvin> oh i think kris sent something to Dylan?
[17:49:25] <snover> I‚Äôd like to moo-oo-o üêÑ ve
[17:49:32] <snover> i‚Äôll check with him
[17:49:34] <DaveMethvin> it's being discussed tomorrow for sure, so i'll ask to get everyone updated
[17:49:45] <snover> ok, thanks
[17:49:50] <snover> that‚Äôs all i need!
