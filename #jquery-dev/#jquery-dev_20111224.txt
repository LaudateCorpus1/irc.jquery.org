[07:28:45] <mikesherov> Can anyone tell me what mobile browsers we support?
[07:28:46] <bot-t> (48 hours 50 mins ago) <rworth> tell mikesherov update jquery.com. Thanks
[07:29:40] <mikesherov> I'm trying to figure out what to do for: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10996#comment:10
[08:12:28] <addyosmani> mikesherov: the last time I spoke to John, he mentioned we should aim to provide a similar level of support as jQuery mobile does
[08:12:40] <mikesherov> Hey addy
[08:12:53] <addyosmani> I guess some of this comes down to a problem in that our page mentioning browsers supported doesn't actually cover this well
[08:12:56] <addyosmani> Heya :)
[08:13:11] <addyosmani> this was a while back though, so don't quote me on it! haha.
[08:13:16] <mikesherov> I'm mostly concerned with http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10996#comment:10
[08:13:59] <addyosmani> mikesherov: did anyone add you to the bug triage google group?
[08:14:09] <addyosmani> I'm assuming so. The others have privs to do so
[08:14:22] <mikesherov> which address?
[08:14:30] <addyosmani> one sec
[08:14:30] <addyosmani> http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-bugs-team
[08:14:31] <mikesherov> is that the same as the regular bugs team ML?
[08:14:37] <mikesherov> yeah, I'm on that one
[08:14:39] <addyosmani> yep
[08:14:40] <addyosmani> cool
[08:14:53] <addyosmani> let me post in there asking about this. Its something we need to nail for the future anyway
[08:15:14] <mikesherov> OK, cool
[08:15:29] <mikesherov> some times I'm not sure whether to comment in the bug tracker or on the ML
[08:15:45] <mikesherov> do you know how I can get added to the organization members listed here: https://github.com/jquery
[08:16:03] <addyosmani> The original goal with the ML was for longer discussions to be logged somewhere but I guess that that line got blurred once the -meetings started
[08:16:10] <addyosmani> I would ask rworth
[08:16:17] <addyosmani> He'd prolly know!
[08:17:15] <mikesherov> Thanks
[08:19:27] <mikesherov> I was asking about the support, because I'm wondering what to do for the conditional. If we only support getBoundingClientRect, then we don't need any webkit fallback
[08:19:55] <mikesherov> If we support old mobile safari, then we need the webkit only hack
[08:20:23] <mikesherov> and then, if we support browsers that don't have either of those, we need to keep the old ugly code anyway :-\
[08:21:26] <mikesherov> and the other question becomes, what do we do for browsers that support getBoundingClientRect nor webkit? Should getOffset just return 0,0, or should the function remain undef?
[08:21:48] <addyosmani> mikesherov: http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-bugs-team/browse_thread/thread/a0c0ccbcc031ba43
[08:21:53] <addyosmani> for the first issue about mobile support
[08:21:55] <mikesherov> Just got the email
[08:21:58] <addyosmani> coool
[08:22:40] <mikesherov> I'm going to follow that up with the specific concerns I just raised
[08:22:52] <addyosmani> on the second, I would say: if you're finding that it takes time to get a response from the others on a particular ticket (happens all the time) and you can't catch them in -dev, definitely opt for the ML
[08:22:56] <addyosmani> great :)
[08:23:21] <mikesherov> yeah, I've been trying to rely on bot-t for out of sync communication, but you're right
[08:23:28] <mikesherov> go to the ML
[08:25:54] <addyosmani> hopefully that should work
[08:26:51] <mikesherov> thanks
[08:27:24] <mikesherov> btw, great job on backbone-mobile-search
[08:27:52] <mikesherov> great example of what is possible these days when you mix and match the right libraries
[08:30:11] <addyosmani> thanks mikesherov :)
[08:30:22] <addyosmani> i'm really hoping to push that work forward with backbone-fundamentals
[08:30:48] <addyosmani> there's some amazing work that's been done this year in getting backbone hooked up to other things but a lot of the work is either disparate or people haven't had a chance to read about it
[08:30:53] <addyosmani> going to try helping with that
[08:31:46] <mikesherov> cool
[08:34:33] <mikesherov> also posted to the ML, can you let me know if what I said made any sense?
[08:38:14] <addyosmani> sure thing
[08:38:43] <addyosmani> it makes total sense
[08:39:56] <mikesherov> I'm trying to save as many bytes as possible
[08:40:06] <mikesherov> this thing could be .5K gone by the end of it
[08:40:26] <addyosmani> Not against a 3rd option for unsupported browsers that returns top:0, left:0 / something more elegant personally
[08:40:45] <addyosmani> but I agree with not necessarily supporting browsers without support for either feature
[08:41:20] <mikesherov> yeah, I mean, IMHO, returning top:0, left:0 is just as crappy as not defining the function
[08:41:35] <mikesherov> at least with an undefined function, the dev knows something is wrong!
[08:42:27] <mikesherov> and there are 4 specific support tests for the fallback, which leads me to believe that a specific browser was targetted for those tests
[08:42:51] <mikesherov> and if that browser is no longer supported, than at least we can remove the support test paths...
[08:43:00] <addyosmani> agreed.
[08:43:19] <mikesherov> I mean, everyone loves the "feature test instead of UA sniff" pattern these days
[08:43:22] <addyosmani> If it's possible to reduce unnecessary fallbacks that are outdated support-wise, all for it.
[08:43:23] <mikesherov> and I agree with that
[08:43:40] <mikesherov> but at least document in the code which browsers caused you to write the test!
[08:43:53] <addyosmani> absolutely.
[08:44:36] <mikesherov> I think a great standard for the team to adopt is to always comment which browser causes which support test, at least initially
[08:45:00] <mikesherov> and then when jQuery drops a browser, the first thing we should do is to see if we can eliminate the cruft
[08:45:52] <mikesherov> that came out in the "how do we make jQuery smaller" discussion, and no one acknowledged it... it's really hard to tell exactly how much code is there for IE6's benefit, or FF3.6, or Safari4 or 3
[08:46:35] <mikesherov> Merry christmas eve, rwaldron
[08:46:45] <rwaldron> thanks dude
[08:46:57] <rwaldron> Merry Christmas Eve to you as well
[08:47:02] <mikesherov> thanks
[08:47:29] <addyosmani> merry christmas to all!
[08:47:38] <mikesherov> did you happen to catch Addy's and My jquery-bugs-team posts?
[08:47:43] <addyosmani> rwaldron: your thoughts on the browser support shizzle on the ML would be appreciated :)
[08:47:45] <rwaldron> haha you to Tiny Addy
[08:47:50] <addyosmani> :p
[08:47:54] <rwaldron> (ya know.. like Tiny Tim)
[08:48:02] <addyosmani> that's so going to become a thing now
[08:48:11] <rwaldron> addyosmani hm?
[08:48:13] <addyosmani> as long as I don't die at the end of the movie, I don't mind!
[08:48:13] <mikesherov> Tiny Addy
[08:48:29] <addyosmani> rwaldron: ^ see. its become a thing already.
[08:48:46] <rwaldron> what browser support shizzle are you referring to?
[08:48:50] <mikesherov> http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-bugs-team/browse_thread/thread/a0c0ccbcc031ba43?pli=1
[08:48:57] <addyosmani> rwaldron: on the ML, we were wondering exactly what level of mobile support core officially offers
[08:49:00] <rwaldron> oh, duh
[08:49:17] <rwaldron> my gmail had not yet refreshed new emails
[08:49:26] <mikesherov> and not only that, but I'm wondering specifically for a certain ticket, what does "unsupported" mean
[08:49:27] <rwaldron> mbp has been closed since yesterday...
[08:51:04] <rwaldron> have I ever mentioned how much I hate Java programmers dipping their API dicks into our JavaScript punch?
[08:51:09] <rwaldron> "webkitConvertPointFromNodeToPage"
[08:51:16] <rwaldron> get the fuck out of here.
[08:52:13] <mikesherov> but aren't Java and Javascript the same thing? <<<< trolling
[08:52:47] <mikesherov> I mean, they are the same like car and carnage are the same, right?
[08:52:59] <Clooth> whats javascript
[08:53:17] <Clooth> addyosmani should be a verb
[08:53:52] <rwaldron> mikesherov nice one
[08:54:33] <addyosmani> mikesherov: that reminds me of the recruiters that email about Java jobs everyday. Like JavaScript? You'll obviously love our Java roles! trolololol.
[08:54:57] <mikesherov> HAHA
[08:55:17] <Clooth> HAHA
[08:55:27] <mikesherov> Do you like PHP? You'll love Python! Because they both start with the same thing! A "P"!
[08:55:45] <Clooth> and they both look like "p"
[08:55:48] <addyosmani> seriously. It literally gets that dumb sometimes.
[08:55:52] <rwaldron> That has a lot of hilarious potential
[08:55:57] <rwaldron> Anything wth a "C"
[08:55:59] <mikesherov> Do you like Java? Because then you'll love doing the Javelin Toss
[08:56:00] <addyosmani> :p
[08:56:02] <rwaldron> think about it..
[08:56:25] <mikesherov> LOLOL
[08:56:47] <rwaldron> I have some resumes out in the world from when I mainly focused on PHP dev
[08:57:07] <rwaldron> I get really gnarly recruiter emails
[08:57:41] <rwaldron> I may start replying with "reviews" of their email
[08:57:47] <mikesherov> LOL
[08:57:50] <addyosmani> LOL
[08:57:53] <addyosmani> Doooo it
[08:58:02] <rwaldron> let me see if I can find the email that inspired this...
[08:58:02] <addyosmani> and share your replies
[08:59:44] <rwaldron> http://gyazo.com/6cec156832ed374e1c73bb2c40eb5599.png
[08:59:58] <rwaldron> this will blow your mind
[09:00:09] <addyosmani> are you lookoing for something, rick?
[09:00:10] <addyosmani> haha
[09:00:32] <mikesherov> absorbing this now
[09:01:43] <rwaldron> you may need to read it twice
[09:01:45] <rwaldron> i did
[09:01:53] <mikesherov> this may involve some front end development in PHP/Zend
[09:01:54] <rwaldron> because I couldn't believe what I had written
[09:01:57] <rwaldron> wait
[09:02:00] <rwaldron> huh?
[09:02:06] <rwaldron> I had read*
[09:02:09] <rwaldron> ugh
[09:02:12] <mikesherov> "this may involve some front end development in PHP/Zend"
[09:02:18] <rwaldron> yeah
[09:02:36] <mikesherov> "using a scrubber program and doing some fixes"
[09:02:44] <rwaldron> wait, I have two from this guy
[09:02:46] <rwaldron> same job
[09:02:50] <addyosmani> oh awesome
[09:02:55] <rwaldron> holy shit
[09:03:01] <rwaldron> he used bold font in this one
[09:03:01] <mikesherov> Well, they have server-side JS now, I hadn't heard about front end PHP though
[09:03:29] <rwaldron> http://gyazo.com/4b8a3b88da37d98f7eb8e5b471235b01.png
[09:03:31] <addyosmani> php.js - it's what all the cool kids are using, don't ya know?
[09:03:38] <rwaldron> mikesherov it's like... PerlScript
[09:04:08] <mikesherov> They have a loader program on a linux box
[09:04:11] <mikesherov> WHAT THE FUCK
[09:04:25] <addyosmani> 'Your job is rewriting this shit to C#. C# knowledge optional'
[09:04:32] <mikesherov> No
[09:04:37] <rwaldron> $window->document->write("i'm serious");
[09:04:53] <mikesherov> addy, they are saying that Rick's job is supporting the shitty PHP until someone rewrites the C#
[09:05:04] <rwaldron> yeah, that's what I got out of it
[09:05:07] <addyosmani> mikesherov: at the end they say helping with the rewrite
[09:05:13] <mikesherov> Right
[09:05:16] <mikesherov> they have it both ways
[09:05:16] <rwaldron> Yes, I'd love to shovel shit for you
[09:05:18] <addyosmani> but I know. It's the 'frontend' php they want help with
[09:05:23] <mikesherov> at first, he's just support some shitty PHP
[09:05:40] <mikesherov> then he also is assumed to be doing the migration, but don't worry they have someone else just in case
[09:05:43] <mikesherov> this is too much
[09:05:50] <addyosmani> it's laughable
[09:06:02] <mikesherov> "if needed"
[09:06:13] <addyosmani> you should reply back if he emails you again, rwaldron
[09:06:22] <mikesherov> There are some great recruiters out there
[09:06:28] <mikesherov> but most of them are just clueless
[09:06:49] <rwaldron> mikesherov there is a "recruiter" that actually started the boston javascript meetup
[09:06:56] <mikesherov> you should reply back EVEN IF HE NEVER emails you again, rwaldron
[09:07:11] <rwaldron> he eventually handed over the keys to boaz, al and I
[09:07:23] <rwaldron> he was a cool guy, one of the few
[09:07:33] <mikesherov> Yeah, few and far between
[09:07:45] <mikesherov> when they are good, they are great
[09:07:50] <rwaldron> my dogs are talking about something right now
[09:07:51] <mikesherov> but the business is like a polarizing one
[09:08:11] <mikesherov> either you have someone who like really helps create a market, or you have that guy who's emailing you
[09:08:14] <rwaldron> alli: "roooooOOOooooo...arrooOOoo"
[09:08:28] <rwaldron> taco: "grrrr... ROOF ROOF"
[09:08:37] <mikesherov> Sounds like Taco is angry
[09:08:41] <rwaldron> i need to a sound activated camera
[09:08:45] <rwaldron> i need a*
[09:08:50] <rwaldron> or something
[09:09:05] <rwaldron> by the time I get my phone ready to record them, it's over
[09:09:30] <mikesherov> I'm about 15 seconds away from gutting offset.js and the ugly support tests
[09:10:09] <mikesherov> just buy an arduino, I'm sure sound-activated camera is like one of the built in projects they support
[09:10:40] <rwaldron> i <3 arduino
[09:10:54] <rwaldron> which reminds me.. i need to play with "duino"
[09:11:07] <rwaldron> BUT i left my arduino kits at bocoup
[09:11:09] <rwaldron> effff
[09:13:46] <mikesherov> how far away is it?
[09:13:50] <mikesherov> worth the drive?
[09:13:58] <mikesherov> you can set up a taco-cam!
[09:14:57] <rwaldron> chris williams is handing lea verou's ass to her
[09:15:01] <rwaldron> it's hi-larry-us
[09:15:09] <mikesherov> on twitter?
[09:15:46] <rwaldron> http://twatlr.com/thread/150622777026691072
[09:15:53] <rwaldron> goddamn I love twatler
[09:16:56] <addyosmani> rwaldron: i really </3 her.
[09:17:04] <rwaldron> hahhahaha
[09:17:10] <rwaldron> I'm torn
[09:17:17] <mikesherov> I'm indifferent. Some of her tweets and work are awesome
[09:17:26] <addyosmani> oh, I don't necessarily mean her work
[09:17:27] <mikesherov> I'm a principles before personalities guy
[09:17:31] <addyosmani> just as like. you know..a person :)
[09:17:35] <mikesherov> Right
[09:17:39] <rwaldron> yeah, same here
[09:17:44] <rwaldron> I think some of her work is great
[09:17:51] <rwaldron> but seems to have a chip on her shoulder
[09:17:56] * rwaldron shrugs
[09:18:01] <mikesherov> That's what I mean... If the person can teach me someone, even if they are snarky or sometimes mean-spirited, I gotta look past that
[09:18:24] <mikesherov> I'm here for the coding, not for the personalities
[09:18:41] <mikesherov> I mean, you can argue that Rick here has a super strong personality
[09:19:12] <addyosmani> this is true. That said, I tend to agree with much of what Rick thinks
[09:19:16] <mikesherov> and that prolly clashes a bit with other strong personalities
[09:19:17] <addyosmani> so that makes it easier : p
[09:19:23] <mikesherov> if I never got used to or past that, I would learn nothing from him
[09:19:48] <mikesherov> But he's probably taught me the most, either directly, or indirectly, over the past 3-4 months
[09:19:57] <mikesherov> except maybe DaveMethvin
[09:20:09] <addyosmani> I really want to meet both of them IRL eventually
[09:20:35] <mikesherov> Yeah, people on the internet are way different
[09:20:39] <addyosmani> rick's idiomatic stuff has been pretty hot.
[09:20:39] <mikesherov> it's that whole distance thing
[09:20:46] <mikesherov> Oh, it's unbelievable
[09:21:05] <addyosmani> mikesherov: my experience with meeting people in our circles has been interesting
[09:21:12] <addyosmani> they've all been exactly how they were online so far
[09:21:24] <mikesherov> really? That's interesting
[09:21:52] <mikesherov> I would imagine that some of the latent hostility goes away though
[09:21:58] <addyosmani> oh, for sure
[09:21:59] <mikesherov> that's like a universal
[09:22:01] <rwaldron> thanks guys, I'm blushing
[09:22:08] <rwaldron> if i had a HEART!
[09:22:10] <rwaldron> :D
[09:22:12] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[09:22:13] <addyosmani> lol
[09:22:18] <mikesherov> The tin man of the dev world
[09:22:24] <mikesherov> but you had one all along!!!
[09:23:02] <mikesherov> There's a difference though between the Rick's and the David Mark's of the world though
[09:23:16] <mikesherov> Rick is opinionated, but also helpful, and RIGHT
[09:23:24] <addyosmani> ugh. david mark
[09:23:39] <rwaldron> Well, I'm not always right
[09:23:45] <mikesherov> sure, no on is always right
[09:23:54] <mikesherov>  but at least you can recognize that!
[09:23:58] <addyosmani> though, I imagine rick is more willing to admit when he is wrong
[09:24:01] <rwaldron> but that's what is different between me and david mark
[09:24:05] <mikesherov> exactly
[09:24:06] <addyosmani> with dm, it's like..impossible
[09:24:13] <rwaldron> if i'm wrong, then it's a good thing
[09:24:20] <mikesherov> the number one reason I contribute to Jquery is the feedback
[09:24:39] <mikesherov> number one most powerful phrase a dev can utter is: I don't know
[09:24:44] <addyosmani> i thought it was for all the girls mikesherov
[09:24:48] <addyosmani> girls love the jqueries
[09:24:59] <mikesherov> Well, the wife hates the jQuery
[09:25:07] <rwaldron> yeah, I've learned so much from Dave Methvin by simply admitting "i don't know"
[09:25:09] <addyosmani> hahaha
[09:25:11] <addyosmani> same here
[09:25:13] <mikesherov> "What are you doing on the computer all night?"
[09:25:18] <mikesherov> "Working on jQuery"
[09:25:21] <rwaldron> and then working through to a solution
[09:25:25] <mikesherov> "But you just got home from work"
[09:25:29] <addyosmani> mikesherov: necolas and I were talking about this before
[09:25:34] <mikesherov> "No, it's not work... it's my hobby"
[09:25:37] <addyosmani> his mrs. calls herself a 'coder widow'
[09:25:43] <addyosmani> someone married to someone that is constantly coding
[09:25:47] <mikesherov> "Your work is your hobby? That's weird"
[09:26:18] <rwaldron> Rose is super supportive of extra-curricular computing
[09:26:29] <rwaldron> she's good at remembering things I tell her
[09:26:35] <mikesherov> Oh, Marissa is too.
[09:26:41] <addyosmani> that's pretty awesome rwaldron
[09:26:43] <rwaldron> I think she could actually tell you what a web worker does
[09:26:48] <addyosmani> no way
[09:26:49] <addyosmani> really?
[09:26:57] <mikesherov> She's great. She always tells me to work on this stuff.
[09:27:04] <rwaldron> not in technical detail
[09:27:16] <addyosmani> Mine helps with presentations. Long as I balance work/personal out she's great
[09:27:27] <mikesherov> She just thinks it's weird that I like programming all the time
[09:27:29] <addyosmani> well, still, groking it in itself for a non-coder is pretty cool
[09:28:02] <mikesherov> Yeah, I explained to her (and my yoga alt-lifestyle cousin) what jQuery was yesterday
[09:28:29] <mikesherov> It's super interesting explaining both what jQuery (the code) and jQuery (the idea/organization/open source project) is
[09:28:49] <rwaldron> So, this is actually pretty interesting to me
[09:29:14] <rwaldron> Rose has a number of friends that are into "online media" or are "designers" and shit
[09:29:38] <rwaldron> in the course of casual conversation it
[09:29:40] <rwaldron> ack
[09:29:48] <rwaldron> it's come up several times over the past 2 years
[09:29:58] <rwaldron> and these people know what jQuery is
[09:30:05] <rwaldron> and I'm always kind of surprised
[09:30:42] <rwaldron> and what's more is their reaction, because it usually comes like "I contribute to this open source project, jQuery, it makes JavaScript easy"
[09:30:44] <rwaldron> or whatever
[09:30:54] <rwaldron> and usually it goes like this...
[09:31:24] <rwaldron> "oh, I know jQuery! I used it on a bunch of portfolio sites i built for photographers" (or something similar)
[09:31:51] <mikesherov> right
[09:32:00] <mikesherov> On Thursday, I was at a company holiday party
[09:32:16] <mikesherov> And my coworkers tease me about "jQuery Core Team Member"
[09:32:36] <mikesherov> and so my wife was asking them all "Is it a big deal? Like honestly, is it a cool thing?"
[09:32:38] <mikesherov> LOL
[09:33:07] <mikesherov> and it's like this thing that you as a dev are proud of
[09:33:18] <rwaldron> damn, jdalton's deepClone is impressive.
[09:33:24] <mikesherov> but you're expecting it to be "meh" to others
[09:33:32] <mikesherov> and surprised when it isn't
[09:33:36] <mikesherov> linky?
[09:33:41] <rwaldron> I've been working on a "deep" clone method for a month or two, I took a different approach
[09:33:49] <rwaldron> and mine is only for modern browsers
[09:33:52] <rwaldron> but this is genious
[09:34:16] <rwaldron> mikesherov it's definitely a nerd pride thing :D
[09:34:44] <rwaldron> When your code touches 26.6 million sites worth of users, you fucking WIN.
[09:35:25] <addyosmani> rwaldron: it's pretty sweet re: jd's deepClone. Didn't see yours yet, but would love to take a look. Needed to perf test a decent one for something at work a while back. Something more performant is always useful.
[09:35:59] <rwaldron> addyosmani mine will only work where support for property descriptors exists
[09:36:03] <rwaldron> one sec.
[09:36:40] <rwaldron> I'm going to add his tests to mine and see what happens
[09:36:47] <addyosmani> awesome
[09:36:53] <mikesherov> you guys have a link to it?

[09:38:06] <addyosmani> brbrbs.
