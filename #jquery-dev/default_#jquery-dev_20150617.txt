[04:24:07] <m_gol> `tell timmywil let me know when you're available for a moment
[04:24:07] <b-ot> m_gol: Iâ€™ll tell timmywil about that.
[06:44:30] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I like https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2401 but I'd like to be sure MS doesn't plan to fix the bug in a future IE11 update or we're break their fix :D
[06:44:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i pinged reybango about it
[06:44:47] <m_gol> k, thanks
[06:45:06] <m_gol> this would be epic irony ;)
[06:52:21] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: in case you didn't catch up: we have 2 issues with Edge currently, one is missing window.onfocusing (a minor issue, using a polyfill doesn't break anything at least) and one more important one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2390
[06:53:35] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: yeah i'd love to see Edge fix #2390
[06:53:46] <m_gol> in this later one we really need MS to fix the bug if possible as we now have absolutely no way to restrict the fix to IE/Edge as we looked at documentMode. Applying the workaround everywhere breaks some things so that's not a good option.
[06:54:06] <m_gol> overall it's looking good, though :)
[06:54:17] <m_gol> and they fixed 4 our support tests
[06:54:27] <m_gol> including boxSizingReliable :)

[11:51:58] <paul_irish> is there structured data for release dates of all jquery releases?
[11:52:13] <paul_irish> probably via npm + some manual work
[12:00:08] <m_gol> paul_irish: `npm info jquery time`, but from our end dates are accurate only for 1.11+ & 2.1+ releases
[12:00:29] <m_gol> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery#Release_history also has info
[12:00:38] <m_gol> for all major & minor releases
[12:00:49] <paul_irish> i shared this before but
[12:00:52] <paul_irish> here's the raw data
[12:00:53] <paul_irish> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18_ZoSaUWTUS2Xm7-R2hie3BInAZjkzpvu3FW-Rw9TP8/edit#gid=1705553499
[12:01:05] <paul_irish> jquery lib use by version on google cdn
[12:01:39] <m_gol> I wonder where does 1.7.2 come from mostly
[12:01:48] <m_gol> Pinterest used to use 1.7 but I see they're on 1.11 now
[12:09:22] <paul_irish> i have a bet
[12:09:30] <paul_irish> that its proportional to time since release
[12:13:54] <m_gol> seems plausible :)
