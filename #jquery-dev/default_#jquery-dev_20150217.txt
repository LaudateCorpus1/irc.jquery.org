[03:13:07] <m_gol> markelog: what's up?
[03:18:37] <m_gol> markelog_: what's up?
[03:19:01] <markelog_> teach me how to restart swarm job
[03:19:20] <markelog_> for example, i have this - http://swarm.jquery.org/job/4352
[03:19:22] <m_gol> you need to log in
[03:19:32] <markelog_> i don't have account as i recall
[03:19:56] <m_gol> markelog_: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/TestSwarm#create-users
[03:20:01] <m_gol> there are no "user" accounts
[03:20:06] <m_gol> but an account per project
[03:20:12] <m_gol> I know, weird ;)
[03:20:39] <m_gol> I constantly re-login when I switch between jquery & jqueryweekly as they have diff users...
[03:21:07] <m_gol> id === username
[03:21:11] <markelog_> got it! thanks 
[03:21:14] <markelog_> just restarted it
[03:22:27] <m_gol> markelog_: switching to Karma may be hard as long as we have often failures like that...
[03:22:44] <m_gol> TestSwarm has its faults but at least you can restart single runs manually
[03:23:51] <markelog_> just as i suspected - false positive
[03:24:03] <markelog_> that's not the only problem with this concept (
[03:24:41] <markelog_> 45 tests in sizzle and they sometimes fail for no apparent reason, testswarm is much more stable
[03:25:10] <markelog_> i suspect it's because of the socket.io connection
[03:29:22] <m_gol> Karma has a development version with newer socket.io
[03:29:25] <m_gol> but it's still WIP
[03:29:49] <m_gol> this is the only version that works correctly with BrowserStack when connecting from OS X to a browser on OS X
[03:30:06] <m_gol> I had to disable Safari testing on my company's project for now because of this issue
[03:32:42] <markelog_> hm, i.e. sizzle tests should fail locally?
[03:32:46] <m_gol> yup
[03:33:03] <m_gol> irony: the newer socket.io branch of Karma branched from master some time ago which makes it incompatible with Node 0.12/io.js for now :D
[03:33:20] <markelog_> just tried "grunt test --browsers=bs_safari-8.0" from sizzle repo
[03:33:23] <markelog_> it works fine
[03:33:30] <markelog_> but i didn't update to .12
[03:33:43] <m_gol> ah, yeah, Sizzle tests might be passing on Safari, esp. desktop
[03:33:48] <m_gol> because there are not too many of them
[03:33:57] <markelog_> how many tests do you have?
[03:34:33] <markelog_> assertions wise
[03:34:53] <m_gol> in my project I have about 1000 tests and they disconnect from Safari all the time
[03:35:17] <m_gol> but that may be causing issues with iOS and - who knows - maybe Android
[03:35:25] <m_gol> for Sizzle
[03:35:42] <markelog_> did you tried browserstack runner?
[03:36:00] <m_gol> it's funny that browsers on Windows work more stable
[03:36:22] <markelog_> it would be really to cool to have a meeting with browserstack people and show them these errors
[03:36:25] <m_gol> I didn't, I have the whole infrastructure on Karma with preprocessors etc. so it'd require some refort to get it running on browserstack-runner
[03:36:37] <markelog_> right, you use angular right?
[03:37:07] <m_gol> yes
[03:37:21] <markelog_> it should be pretty simple i think, those preprocessors aren't needed if you have builded app
[03:37:44] <m_gol> hmm. maybe, I'm mostly preprocessing JSONs
[03:37:54] <markelog_> as far as i recall, you add one script to it and show path to your server
[03:37:54] <m_gol> I would have to modify the code to actually save the processed files
[03:37:56] <m_gol> and then load them
[03:39:45] <markelog_> i guess it depends on your app :-), but it should be much more simplier then with karma
[03:40:40] <markelog_> but browserstack needs to work without those issues
[03:40:51] <markelog_> otherwise it easier to setup your own grid
[03:41:25] <markelog_> this is why i think it would be cool to have a meeting with those guys
[03:41:46] <markelog_> maybe i/we should talk with Jorn about that
[03:41:56] <markelog_> jzaefferer: .
[03:45:11] <m_gol> the problem with an own grid is that you need to have a Mac hooked into Jenkins to run Safari ;)
[04:11:16] <markelog_> not the only problem :-), but yeah things like that are awful, but more stable 
[04:12:22] <markelog_> you can have a vm to mitigate that particular one
[04:13:05] <m_gol> markelog_: you can only run an OS X VM on an OS X host... at least officially
[04:15:02] <markelog_> didn't tried myself but i hear it's not difficult 
[04:17:03] <m_gol> markelog_: I'm sure it breaks Apple's EULA :P
[04:17:33] <markelog_> :-)
[04:19:20] <markelog_> well, if it does, you could always buy cheapest mac and do stuff on it, but it sounds, mmm... weird, it would be much better with bb working right, even without real mac devops costs would be high
[04:31:37] <jzaefferer> what's up?
[04:34:15] <jzaefferer> markelog_: I can introduce you to people at BrowserStack. They're very much interested in our help to get rid of any failures.
[04:35:18] <markelog_> jzaefferer: that would be intersting, i think we could triage the bugs together, could be productive
[04:37:40] <jzaefferer> markelog_: I'll add you to the last email thread I had with them
