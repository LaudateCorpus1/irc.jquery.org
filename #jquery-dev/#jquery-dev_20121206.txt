[09:34:51] <DaveMethvin> so kborchers i also wonder why there isn't a symmetrical check for setting min above max? see, down this path lies madness :D
[09:35:26] <kborchers> yeah
[09:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Because min isn't configurable :-
[10:04:13] <kswedberg> gnarf: Any idea why jquery-1.8.0.js is the last version listed at http://code.jquery.com/#jquery-all ?
[10:10:23] <gnarf> because someone hasn't been updating the index
[10:10:37] <gnarf> I'll bump that process up in my task list
[10:13:52] <kswedberg> gnarf: cool. thx. :)

[12:41:21] <gnarf> rwaldron mikesherov gibson042 who is "triage" team, and do we have a list of github usernames? I'd like to make an @jquery/jquery-triage mention on github and need a list
[12:44:49] <gnarf> gibson042: seems good to just remove that to me too, but haven't heard from timmywil or DaveMethvin

[12:47:04] <timmywil> gnarf, gibson042: I'm fine with removing most of it. the note about qsa bugs is still applicable
[12:47:44] <DaveMethvin> maybe we should put a pointer to a Sizzle wontfix page?  sorry i have a meeting in a sec

[14:22:15] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I've tried to explain to that dude that his change breaks back compat
[14:22:20] <rwaldron> and he kept pushing it
[14:22:53] <rwaldron> "Interesting. What is the stance on backward compatibility? I know of 1+ BC regressions that got WontFix-ed"
[14:23:13] <rwaldron> and then on and on
[14:23:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[14:23:39] <rwaldron> I just want to be like... "because I said so"
[14:23:49] <DaveMethvin> everyone wants their solution in core
[14:23:57] <DaveMethvin> because it makes sense
[14:23:58] <DaveMethvin> to them
[14:24:13] <DaveMethvin> and the last thing we need is ANOTHER special case in ajax
[14:27:47] <rwaldron> I agree with everything you just said.
[14:28:01] <rwaldron> And now he's doing it to you
[14:40:18] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I think you just walked into a trap
[14:40:25] <rwaldron> " There's no way we'd want to put this in core since it would require having a JSON.stringify shim for oldIE."
[14:40:31] <rwaldron> this is what he first asked me about
[14:40:52] <rwaldron> I'll wager $1 he suggests that we shim it.
[14:41:11] <DaveMethvin> well i suggest we don't, SO THERE NYAH NYAH
[14:41:21] <rwaldron> >:)
[14:41:28] <rwaldron> I already did that!!!
[14:41:46] <DaveMethvin> I can do a JSON.stringify shim in one line
[14:42:02] <DaveMethvin> <script src="json2.js"></script>
[14:42:18] <rwaldron> \BOOM/
[14:46:35] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #546: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/546/
[14:46:35] <doesallmagic> richard.gibson: Don't test what ain't there no more
[14:55:27] <DaveMethvin> You can't spend what you ain't got, you can't lose what you never had
[14:56:16] <DaveMethvin> funny, I've moved .sub to the compat plugin but must have forgotten to remove it from core
[15:03:15] <rwaldron> here we go
[15:03:24] <rwaldron> He made me do this dance
[15:03:29] <rwaldron> what about >2.0
[15:03:34] <rwaldron> *facepalm*
[15:03:36] <DaveMethvin> NO
[15:03:52] <rwaldron> forreals
[15:04:02] <DaveMethvin> BUT WE HAD ONE REQUEST IN THE LAST SIX YEARS!
[15:04:06] <DaveMethvin> THIS MUST BE IMPORTANT!
[15:04:09] <rwaldron> hahaha
[15:04:50] <rwaldron> ya know... when I worked with a client that had some weird aspx thing that required json in the post body, i just included json2, stringified and processData: false
[15:04:52] <rwaldron> moving on
[15:05:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah but that must have taken, what, five minutes?
[15:05:32] <DaveMethvin> we don't have time for that!
[15:05:35] <rwaldron> It was hard
[15:05:46] <rwaldron> toooo complicated
[15:06:14] <DaveMethvin> instead let's update core, add unit tests, revise the docs, and explain to ppl why 1.9 can't do this
[15:06:16] <rwaldron> I honestly believe that when people encounter these issues and there first instinct is to correct jQuery, they're doing it wrong
[15:06:30] <rwaldron> because at this point, jQuery's been through the wringer
[15:06:40] <rwaldron> real problems: addressed
[15:06:44] <DaveMethvin> well regardless, it's not like they can't do this with a few lines of their own, that's the thing
[15:06:52] <rwaldron> right, exactly
[15:06:57] <DaveMethvin> we're arguing about 1 line vs 4 lines
[15:07:01] <rwaldron> but for those that want to argue about it
[15:07:08] <rwaldron> *nods*
[15:23:16] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez are you familiar with the input type issue?
[15:23:26] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[15:23:34] <rwaldron> great. patch welcome
[15:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> You want me to send a patch that doesn't throw an error?
[15:25:15] <rwaldron> Should it throw or fail silently?
[15:25:33] <rwaldron> there is no way to "patch over"
[15:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> it should throw
[15:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, the browser error shouldn't be caught.
[15:26:40] <scott_gonzalez> We shouldn't patch over it.
[15:27:06] <rwaldron> ok, but then you're saying jQuery should behave differently based on the browser?
[15:27:23] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[15:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> If the browser doesn't support X, and we can't make it support X, we shouldn't prevent X in all browsers.
[15:28:09] <scott_gonzalez> That's like saying that you can't set border-radius because IE6 doesn't support it.
[15:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> I realize that setting border-radius won't throw an error.
[15:28:29] <rwaldron> but IE doesn't throw on border-radius
[15:28:35] <rwaldron> I dont really feel like arguing
[15:28:57] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to think of some other example where we let an error go through in only some browsers.
[15:29:03] <rwaldron> I'm actually sick of arguing with people that seem to infinitely know better
[15:29:18] <rwaldron> like I said, patch welcome.
[15:29:25] <rwaldron> I won't even review it
[15:29:29] <rwaldron> I'll let someone else
[16:43:43] <rwaldron> I wish we could have this for dramatic bugs reading
