[07:26:19] <doesallmagic2> Dave Methvin: Dimensions: Reverse a check to avoid potential reflows
[07:29:36] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: once those are done i think we are ready for a release if you have time
[07:29:54] <m_gol> I'm leaving in about an hour but before that it's ok
[07:30:16] <DaveMethvin> it's a beta, what the heck. :)
[07:30:31] <m_gol> :)
[07:30:57] <m_gol> I wonder how quickly someone would notice if we broke *everything* in a beta :P
[07:31:17] <m_gol> e.g. packaged Zepto and called it jQuery :P
[07:31:22] <DaveMethvin> haha
[07:31:25] <DaveMethvin> that would be a good one
[07:31:39] <m_gol> since this is a replacement... :P
[07:31:55] <doesallmagic2> Yippee, build fixed!
[07:31:55] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core build #1139: FIXED in 5 min 36 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/1139/
[07:31:56] <doesallmagic2> m.goleb: Css: Use only positive integers as values for widows/orphans
[07:31:59] <DaveMethvin> we should do that with jquery-latest instead
[07:32:02] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[07:32:03] <m_gol> hahaha
[07:32:40] <m_gol> we'll have to run effects tests manually on IE6/7 & Android 2.3-4.4 because of these timeout issues
[07:32:50] <DaveMethvin> i see you restarted ie8 ... come on ie8 we have faith in you!
[07:32:52] <m_gol> not necessary now but before the final release we should do it ;)
[07:33:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:33:15] <m_gol> IE8 sometimes gets in order quickly and sometimes I have to reset it, like, 20 times before it behaves
[07:37:57] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core 1.x build #435: STILL FAILING in 6 min 2 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201.x/435/
[07:37:58] <doesallmagic2> m.goleb: Css: Use only positive integers as values for widows/orphans
[07:45:53] <m_gol> I need to write a Chrome extension for restarting those tests on IE8 :P
[07:45:59] <DaveMethvin> haha
[07:46:06] <DaveMethvin> i think this is good enough tho
[07:46:20] <DaveMethvin> either ie8 will cooperate or it won't but we know why it's not working
[07:48:28] <m_gol> yup
[07:48:32] <m_gol> it passed previous tests
[07:48:37] <m_gol> and last commit changed one test only
[07:48:45] <DaveMethvin> so you want to start the release?
[07:48:56] <m_gol> my super professional Chrome DevTools snippet
[07:48:57] <m_gol> setInterval(function () {
[07:48:57] <m_gol>     $('.swarm-status-error .swarm-reset-run-single').click();
[07:48:57] <m_gol> }, 10000);
[07:48:58] <m_gol> ;)
[07:48:59] <m_gol> ok
[07:49:42] <DaveMethvin> so this will be 2.1.1-beta2
[07:49:49] <DaveMethvin> i hope we don't need any more
[07:49:54] <m_gol> maybe I should start with 1.11.1-beta2
[07:50:03] <m_gol> oh, we shouldn't have this problem now
[07:50:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's fine if you want tho
[07:50:09] <m_gol> now that jquery-release handles tags
[07:50:16] <DaveMethvin> we can test that :)
[07:50:20] <m_gol> so I might try starting from 2.x and see if it works :)
[07:50:21] <m_gol> yep
[07:50:47] <DaveMethvin> oh maybe we should call this an RC
[07:51:02] <DaveMethvin> it's all psychological
[07:51:04] <m_gol> :)
[07:51:09] <m_gol> I'm fine with that
[07:51:14] <DaveMethvin> how about 2.1.1-rc1 then?
[07:51:21] <m_gol> though it seems a little overkill to have rc for patch releases
[07:51:23] <m_gol> but whatever ;)
[07:51:35] <m_gol> if it helps us gain testers
[07:51:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's just to make people realize that they should test
[07:52:01] <m_gol> ok, starting the process
[07:52:03] <m_gol> ah, btw
[07:52:08] <m_gol> can we remove the jquery user
[07:52:10] <m_gol> like, completely>
[07:52:14] <DaveMethvin> yes!
[07:52:18] <m_gol> everyone seems to agree we should do it
[07:53:14] <m_gol> removed from maintainers
[07:55:00] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: should I do a test run as last time?
[07:55:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah, just for safety since a lot of stuff has changed in -release
[07:55:23] <m_gol> ok
[07:59:37] <m_gol> fail
[08:00:00] <m_gol> where does it take the version from?
[08:00:09] <m_gol> the one in package.json is correct, the one in bower.json is not
[08:00:59] <DaveMethvin> right, the one in bower is generated
[08:01:13] <DaveMethvin> it should be in the tagged commit
[08:01:14] <m_gol> so why does it complain :/
[08:01:19] <m_gol> Validating current version...
[08:01:20] <m_gol> The current version is 2.1.1pre.
[08:01:20] <m_gol> The version must be a pre version, e.g., 1.2.3-pre.
[08:01:20] <m_gol> Aborting.
[08:01:20] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[08:01:35] <DaveMethvin> oh you'll need to manually edit that i bet
[08:01:39] <DaveMethvin> it's not semver
[08:01:50] <DaveMethvin> i think that's the way scott_gonzalez was figuring we'd deal with that
[08:02:09] <m_gol> I know
[08:02:14] <m_gol> but package.json has a correct entry
[08:02:16] <m_gol> 2.1.1-pre
[08:02:33] <DaveMethvin> let's look at our script, maybe it needs an update
[08:05:05] <DaveMethvin> okay so it's not our stuff
[08:05:07] <m_gol> it breaks here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/blob/master/lib/repo.js#L161
[08:05:21] <m_gol> but currentVersion is read via Release.readPackage() and it reads package.json
[08:05:39] <m_gol> argh
[08:05:39] <m_gol> ok
[08:05:44] <m_gol> I need to have current master?
[08:05:51] <m_gol> on the fork
[08:05:54] <m_gol> deja vu :D
[08:05:59] <DaveMethvin> haha
[08:06:35] <m_gol> ok, repeat
[08:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, if you're actually up to date, it'll work :-)
[08:07:05] <m_gol> I made exactly the same mistake last time
[08:07:07] <DaveMethvin> what a DUMB system! :P
[08:07:10] <m_gol> ;)
[08:07:29] <DaveMethvin> always clone the repo
[08:07:45] <m_gol> yes, I removed everything and I started over
[08:08:15] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: I feel that if it detects we're doing a test release on a fork, it should check if the fork branch matches the official one
[08:08:26] <m_gol> then I'd know immediately what's the problem
[08:08:26] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds terrible.
[08:08:38] <m_gol> why?
[08:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> It means you can only test changes by committing to the main repo.
[08:09:24] <m_gol> ok, it could at least check if my branch X has official branch X as an ancestor
[08:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> So you want it to query GitHub for a matching branch name, get the SHA, check the history of the local branch and verify the SHA exists?
[08:10:38] <m_gol> git can check the common ancestor of 2 commits
[08:10:48] <m_gol> we could check if it's the official branch
[08:10:58] <scott_gonzalez> So you want it to query GitHub for a matching branch name, get the SHA, check the history of the local branch and verify the SHA exists?
[08:12:14] <m_gol> 99% of the time we don't need to have any excessive commits during the release, even when we're testing
[08:12:25] <m_gol> so I guess it's mostly for testing if updates to jquery-release work
[08:12:36] <m_gol> but checking the common ancestor could work
[08:13:00] <scott_gonzalez> From a branch of the same name on GitHub?
[08:13:17] <m_gol> all I know is that I made the same mistake of not updating my fork's master twice and both times the error message didn't tell me a lot; that suggests something could be more intuitive ;)
[08:13:20] <m_gol> yes, for example
[08:14:51] <m_gol> if you really needed to do a test on additional commits that start from an earlier commit than the tip of the branch, there could be a flag for it
[08:14:58] <m_gol> but I don't think this is a common scenario
[08:15:31] <DaveMethvin> releases are like taxes, we do them rarely enough that it's easy to forget any manual step
[08:15:48] <DaveMethvin> which is the whole reason for jquery-release :)
[08:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> Just start from a clean repo and you'll never have problem.s
[08:16:24] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: how do I start from a clean fork?
[08:16:26] <DaveMethvin> so jquery-release should check and say "I'm not fresh enough!"
[08:16:28] <m_gol> I'd have to delete mine
[08:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, or manually fork.
[08:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> Or just clone.
[08:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> Cloning = forking
[08:16:52] <arschmitz> i always just clone
[08:16:57] <arschmitz> and use the local clone
[08:17:01] <m_gol> I don't understand
[08:17:08] <m_gol> I need to have current master on mzgol/jquery
[08:17:12] <m_gol> how cloning helps me?
[08:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> Because you don't need to use GitHub.
[08:17:23] <arschmitz> m_gol: you can point to a local folder instead
[08:17:25] <m_gol> ah, ok
[08:17:29] <m_gol> that seems better
[08:17:40] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/mzgol/jquery/commit/64b0d653416a4ba2c651ab889c8821d37d22e0d3
[08:18:10] <DaveMethvin> lgtm!
[08:19:02] <DaveMethvin> cdn step hasn't completed
[08:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/fake-cdn/commit/fafbd69df2bd1202ad6f581236d519caef8223b0
[08:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> It was a test, so it went to fake-cdn
[08:21:36] <DaveMethvin> oh right, we're not to the real thing
[08:21:39] <arschmitz> i love the fake repos :)
[08:21:40] <DaveMethvin> nvm
[08:21:47] <DaveMethvin> they faked me out!

[08:24:40] <DaveMethvin> NOW we're talkin
[08:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I'm stepping up my game for jquery commits.
[08:25:01] <scott_gonzalez> I've moved from whitespace to dashes in versions :-P
[08:25:06] <DaveMethvin> i still will respect your whitespace
[08:25:18] <scott_gonzalez> We'll see what other meaningless changes I can get in :-)
[08:25:32] <m_gol> -beta1 -> beta.1? ;)
[08:25:34] <DaveMethvin> at least you can point to the README now
[08:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> I've got an awesome track record for node commits.
[08:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/joyent/node/commits?author=scottgonzalez
[08:26:41] <m_gol> ;)
[08:26:49] <m_gol> my awesome script is still restarting the job in IE8
[08:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> My first one char commit in node was an actual bug fix back in the 0.1 days :-)
[08:27:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah now i should do the same and wander around github making typo PRs
[08:27:17] <DaveMethvin> maybe i'll make one for Zepto
[08:28:17] <scott_gonzalez> I think I still have the project that I wrote in 0.1.x
[08:28:20] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if it still works.
[08:28:34] <DaveMethvin> i want to know when they'll get to 1.0
[08:28:39] <DaveMethvin> you know, for semver and all
[08:28:41] <m_gol> Zepto thinks about giving up on __proto__
[08:28:47] <m_gol> but not because of IE
[08:28:50] <DaveMethvin> just as IE supports it in 11
[08:28:53] <m_gol> but because Fx got slow
[08:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> oh no
[08:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> TypeError: Object #<process> has no method 'mixin'
[08:29:03] <m_gol> and told them they're doing it wrong
[08:29:05] <m_gol> ;)
[08:29:19] <scott_gonzalez> The good old days when node has a $.extend()-like method...
[08:30:02] <m_gol> release complete
[08:30:06] <m_gol> now 1.11.1-rc1
[08:30:15] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: should I start with a test release as well?
[08:30:20] <DaveMethvin> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1-rc1.js
[08:30:23] <DaveMethvin> yay
[08:30:34] <DaveMethvin> so what do you think m_gol 
[08:30:37] <DaveMethvin> go for it?
[08:30:50] <DaveMethvin> i mean, what are the odds scott_gonzalez screwed up jquery-release?
[08:30:54] <m_gol> ;)
[08:30:55] <m_gol> ok
[08:30:58] <m_gol> I have limited time
[08:31:02] <m_gol> and it's not the final version
[08:31:02] <DaveMethvin> go for it then
[08:31:22] * scott_gonzalez slowly walks away
[08:32:41] <m_gol> the codeorigin repo clones quite long
[08:33:06] <DaveMethvin> yes, that's a pain
[08:33:20] <DaveMethvin> I JUST WANT TO PUSH ONE NEW FILE
[08:33:41] <m_gol> actually, 3 ;)
[08:33:41] <DaveMethvin> so how far away are your parents m_gol?
[08:33:49] <m_gol> about 250 km
[08:33:57] <m_gol> 4,5h by bus, oh yeah
[08:34:13] <m_gol> I need to buy a car ;)
[08:34:16] <DaveMethvin> well not TOO bad i guess
[08:34:48] <DaveMethvin> you write sofware, you can afford a car!
[08:34:50] <m_gol> 155 miles (in these weird American units ;-))
[08:35:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah i did the conversion in my head
[08:35:06] <m_gol> yeah, but I need to have a place to park it as well :D
[08:35:13] <DaveMethvin> i was wondering about that
[08:35:20] <DaveMethvin> if you live in the city it's a pain to have a car
[08:35:30] <DaveMethvin> i guess there is no zipcar (car rental)?

[08:36:30] <DaveMethvin> woo hoo
[08:36:37] <m_gol> there might be sth like that but I'd need to first find such a place and I'm not sure if it wouldn't cost a lot
[08:36:54] <m_gol> besides, I haven't been driving for a couple of years
[08:37:06] <m_gol> you can see how I'm not American ;P
[08:37:40] <DaveMethvin> i don't drive that much either since i work at home
[08:37:51] <DaveMethvin> i drive more when i travel but try to avoid it
[08:38:00] <m_gol> I wouldn't have a place to park nearby my work
[08:38:09] <m_gol> besides, it's quite close anyway
[08:38:23] <m_gol> so I wouldn't have daily occasions now
[08:38:52] <DaveMethvin> one day i'll visit you ... there's a conf in Krakow i wanted to go to but that's pretty far away http://www.devday.pl/CFP
[08:38:52] * m_gol waiting until the codeorigin repo clones
[08:39:08] <m_gol> :)
[08:39:26] <m_gol> there are good train connections between Warsaw and Cracow
[08:39:37] <m_gol> ~3h
[08:39:46] <m_gol> that's not TGV but still not bad ;)
[08:40:05] <DaveMethvin> since it takes about 10h to get from here to there it's not bad i guess
[08:40:49] <m_gol> published!

[09:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> "it wasn't so scary as last time" I'll take that as a remark that jquery-release is in fact improving.

[10:16:09] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: This was mostly a remark that now I'm familiar with the process so I'm not afraid so much I'll mess sth up ;)
[10:16:24] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: But yes, it's improving :)
[10:16:53] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: Do you have a blog post ready?
[10:17:02] <DaveMethvin> not yet
[10:24:01] <m_gol> I enjoy your Twitter conversation
[10:24:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah i feel like i'm missing something but i'm not gonna taunt Domenic further
[10:26:39] <m_gol> Finally configured Colloquy on an iPhone
[10:26:49] <m_gol> Works better than on osx :P
[12:16:47] <DaveMethvin> blog post draft: http://blog.jquery.com/?p=3456&preview=true&preview_id=3456&public=1&nonce=e4434c30f1
[12:18:15] <gnarf> lgtm DaveMethvin 
[12:18:30] <DaveMethvin> thanks gnarf
[12:31:18] <gibson042> DaveMethvin et al.: y'all need a new version of Sizzle before the release
[12:31:32] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[12:31:37] <DaveMethvin> i JUST published the blog post
[12:31:48] <DaveMethvin> let me undo
[12:32:21] <gibson042> dammit
[12:32:29] <gibson042> sorry about that
[12:32:47] <DaveMethvin> we really need a double check on that process
[12:33:08] <DaveMethvin> ok release unpublished
[12:33:23] <gibson042> this time the problem is that jQuery bugs should have been marked as blockers but weren't
[12:33:52] <DaveMethvin> well i think we need a release-stopping warning in jquery-release about there being new commits in sizzle
[12:33:54] <gibson042> so, human process failure instead of machine
[12:34:32] <gibson042> I don't know, jquery-release shouldn't care about Sizzle *commits*, just (maybe) Sizzle tags
[12:34:40] <gibson042> and we don't have a new one of those yet
[12:35:07] <DaveMethvin> i think it would care whether the HEAD is tagged, if not it should prob ask if you really want to release jquery 
[12:35:30] <DaveMethvin> i mean you MIGHT but it just needs to ask
[12:36:48] <gibson042> shall I just try to publish one real quick?
[12:37:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would be good ... we'll need to re-run the script
[12:37:25] <DaveMethvin> not sure if we can actually overwrite the rc1 files that are there
[12:37:41] <DaveMethvin> but i'd prefer to do that than to create an rc2 and never have had an rc1
[12:37:59] <gibson042> that's bad luck anyway... let's show the world how serious we are and give them rc11 :)
[12:42:02] <DaveMethvin> binary, rc10
[12:42:22] <DaveMethvin> i just got a phone call
[12:42:28] <DaveMethvin> bbiab
[13:14:40] <DaveMethvin> ok back
[13:14:58] <gibson042> fighting with the Sizzle release at the moment
[13:15:32] <DaveMethvin> ya know i TOTALLY missed that ticket, should have known we needed a Sizzle for that
[13:15:50] <DaveMethvin> and i actually remember looking at the list ... or starting to 
[13:15:58] <DaveMethvin> too many interruptions these days
[13:17:39] <gibson042> nop biggie

[14:21:25] <gibson042> ok DaveMethvin, here's hoping for a good testswarm run
[14:21:44] <DaveMethvin> how would you like to do a release gibson042 ?
[14:22:09] <DaveMethvin> i will need to add you to the owners on the npm setup
[14:22:23] <gibson042> I'd love to, but have to bail on this one so I can get home and pack for a trip
[14:22:56] <DaveMethvin> ok i have been looking into alternate solutions ... looks like a Ubuntu VM will be my friend
[14:23:06] <gibson042> for sure
