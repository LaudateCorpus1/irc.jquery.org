[03:37:02] <gibson042> .
[05:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a way to detect if the browser supports fixed position with 1.8?
[05:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> Nevermind, I wrote a super simple test.
[05:15:46] <scott_gonzalez> $( "<div>" ).css({ position: "fixed", top: 10 }).appendTo( "body" ).offset().top === 10
[07:29:31] <mikesherov> gnarf: another ticket that was mysteriously fixed by the 1.8 rewrite: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8387 I left it open in case you wanted to write a unit for it.
[07:29:43] <mikesherov> that makes 2 now!
[07:43:05] <gibson042> yeah, that gnarf is sneaky...
[07:45:25] <mikesherov> gnarf: also, there was an open pull request to fix http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9217, but it was closed in favor of being put into the animation rewrite, can you take a look?
[07:50:27] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov gibson042 any ideas about these remaining testswarm fails?
[07:50:29] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/40
[07:50:34] <DaveMethvin> we are SOOOO close
[07:50:55] <DaveMethvin> btw i updated the jquery-git last night
[07:51:21] <DaveMethvin> i think those bugs have something to do with swarm running the tests in an iframe but I cannot repro
[07:51:30] <DaveMethvin> even on a test page where i use an iframe
[07:51:42] <DaveMethvin> but the one-pixel issue seems kind of familiar
[07:52:28] <mikesherov> Yeah, and only on IE8... seems suspect
[07:54:04] <mikesherov> what's weird, is that those tests are the remaining tests that do browser-sniffing
[07:55:06] <DaveMethvin> oh that reminds me, i've wanted to stick an X-UA-Compatible IE=Edge into our test file to be sure it's not in compat mode
[07:55:17] <mikesherov> That's going to be it
[07:55:37] <mikesherov> 	var ie = jQuery.browser.msie && parseInt( jQuery.browser.version, 10 ) < 8;
[07:55:46] <mikesherov> { id: "#relative-2",   top: ie ? 141 : 142, left: 27 }
[07:55:54] <mikesherov> equal( jQuery( this.id ).offset().left, this.left, "jQuery('" + this.id + "').offset().left" );
[07:56:02] <DaveMethvin> aaaaaaah
[07:56:16] <mikesherov> it's probably falling back to ie7, and our stupid browser sniff is biting us
[07:56:21] <DaveMethvin> here lemme fix that now
[07:56:26] <mikesherov> which is why we should be browser sniffing
[07:56:29] <mikesherov> shouldn't*
[07:56:57] <timmywil> gibson042: ping
[07:57:21] <mikesherov> where the hell is bot-t? is he ircjsbot now?
[07:57:28] <mikesherov> ircjsbot: are you bot-t?
[07:57:41] <mikesherov> ircjsbot: tell DaveMethvin hi
[07:57:41] <ircjsbot> mikesherov, OK, I will tell DaveMethvin if I see them.
[07:58:04] <DaveMethvin> well at least one bot is working
[07:58:04] <ircjsbot> DaveMethvin, you have one new message, from mikesherov (23 seconds ago). Tell me if you want to read it (“read”).
[07:58:05] <mikesherov> ircjsbot: tell mikesherov hi
[07:58:05] <ircjsbot> mikesherov, hi
[07:58:07] <DaveMethvin> read
[07:58:16] <DaveMethvin> ircjsbot: read
[07:58:16] <ircjsbot> DaveMethvin, from mikesherov, 35 seconds ago: hi
[07:58:28] <mikesherov> great!
[07:58:48] <mikesherov> ircjsbot: tell gnarf another ticket that was mysteriously fixed by the 1.8 rewrite: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8387 I left it open in case you wanted to write a unit for it.
[07:58:48] <ircjsbot> mikesherov, OK, I will tell gnarf if I see them.
[07:59:01] <mikesherov> ircjsbot: tell gnarf also, there was an open pull request to fix http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9217, but it was closed in favor of being put into the animation rewrite, can you take a look?
[07:59:02] <ircjsbot> mikesherov, OK, I will tell gnarf if I see them.
[08:00:33] <DaveMethvin> i guess i shoulda tested it
[08:00:38] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/7lUKQA
[08:00:38] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Ensure that IE stays in Big Boy mode. - Dave Methvin
[08:01:28] <DaveMethvin> oh good, worksforme still
[08:01:39] <mikesherov> I don't get why those unit tests browser sniff
[08:01:49] <mikesherov> can't we write a support test?
[08:02:17] <DaveMethvin> well then we'd be using the same var as the code itself?
[08:02:25] <DaveMethvin> i guess it was trying to come in from a different angle
[08:02:27] <mikesherov> We do that in some places
[08:02:28] <DaveMethvin> but yeah
[08:02:51] <mikesherov> just get an augmentation value in the test suite.
[08:03:11] <mikesherov> rather than use functionality in our test suite that we're deprecating!
[08:03:49] <DaveMethvin> oh you so picky mikesherov :P
[08:04:05] <DaveMethvin> still waiting for jenkins to pick up that build
[08:04:13] <mikesherov> I suppose we don't focus on the tests as long as they pass
[08:04:23] <DaveMethvin> the dog requires walking, so I'll be back
[08:04:37] <mikesherov> k
[08:04:41] <mikesherov> I'll be gone then
[08:05:01] <mikesherov> have a great day
[08:22:35] <gibson042> timmywil: what's up?
[08:23:20] <timmywil> gibson042: I know we're adding another function, but I think it's necessary. We can however, concat any arrays within checkSet. They don't need to go multiple levels.
[08:23:53] <gibson042> it's so damn expensive to invoke it for every element
[08:26:09] <gibson042> I see your point about preserving indexes, but couldn't that be accomplished with a parallel array?
[08:26:47] <timmywil> isn't it already a parallel array?
[08:28:16] <gibson042> I mean having a new array whose values are the original index of each element in checkSet
[08:28:32] <gibson042> so that checkSet can be safely flattened without losing that information
[08:29:34] <timmywil> I see, so when [ [ 1, 2, 3], 4] is flattened, the parallel array becomes [ 0, 3 ] ?
[08:30:10] <gibson042> [ 0, 0, 0, 1 ]
[08:30:33] <timmywil> ah
[08:30:34] <timmywil> sure
[08:30:43] <timmywil> that could work
[08:30:57] <gibson042> so index of `checkSet[i]` is `checkIndexes[i]` instead of `i`
[08:31:52] <timmywil> gotcha, not a bad idea
[08:45:58] <mikesherov> ?swarm
[08:45:59] <bot-t> (98 hours 40 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell mikesherov I finally go around to verifying all three bugs with animations. Thanks.
[08:45:59] <bot-t> Swarm Status: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/qunit/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerycolor/ -- Jenkins http://swarm.jquery.org:8080
[08:57:13] <gnarf> mikesherov: nice
[08:57:47] <mikesherov> yeah, I was just going through all the effects tickets
[08:57:49] <gnarf> mikesherov: i dunno that #8387 is testable
[08:58:30] <mikesherov> sure, that's fine. I just didn't want to close it without you giving the go ahead first
[08:58:46] <mikesherov> I closed tickets before that you wanted open to write tests for, so I wanted to give you that chance
[09:00:13] <gnarf> thx :)
[09:01:55] <mikesherov> close it if you feel it's untestable.
[09:02:22] <mikesherov> and then http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9217 just needs to be ported to the animation rewrite
[09:07:45] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: how does needsdocs work?
[09:08:08] <mikesherov> Lets say I know something needs docs, do I add needsdocs keyword and close? Or add keyword and leave open?
[09:08:13] <DaveMethvin> when an API and the documentation love each other very much ....
[09:08:13] <bot-t> (25 hours 10 mins ago) <jzaefferer> tell DaveMethvin look, a new -git build, from Jenkins: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js - headers should get an update, that's all in your grunt.js though
[09:08:17] <DaveMethvin> ask your mother
[09:08:36] <DaveMethvin> normally we close the ticket if it's just docs
[09:08:40] <mikesherov> I would imagine I add needsdocs and close, and then when docs are done, the documentor removes the needsdocs keyword
[09:08:48] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:08:49] <mikesherov> ok, that's what I though
[09:08:52] <DaveMethvin> t
[09:09:06] <gnarf> close the ticket and make it an issue on api.jquery.com repo
[09:09:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah i've been holding off on changes
[09:09:18] <kswedberg> gnarf: +1
[09:09:23] <DaveMethvin> they're in the process of migrating, right kswedberg
[09:09:24] <kswedberg> was just writing that
[09:09:25] <DaveMethvin> ?
[09:09:29] <kswedberg> yessir
[09:09:45] <kswedberg> all changes are being made in https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com now
[09:10:00] <DaveMethvin> ah okay, so it's good to change there?
[09:10:06] <mikesherov> cool... I'm just trying to prune the open effects bugs
[09:10:25] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: and when you change something on the live site, rworth or I have been making th change in the repo. :)
[09:10:32] <mikesherov> Closed 3, found 3 that can be closed shortly
[09:10:39] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: absolutely.
[09:10:40] <DaveMethvin> well heck, let me make your life easier kswedberg
[09:11:11] <kswedberg> if it's critical, make it in two places so the change is live asap. otherwise, just in the repo.
[09:11:21] <kswedberg> thank you, DaveMethvin!
[09:12:50] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: insert sad panda face http://swarm.jquery.org/job/45
[09:12:57] <DaveMethvin> but it just occurred to me
[09:13:04] <mikesherov> yeah, I was just about to right that
[09:13:07] <DaveMethvin> that won't help in testswarm anyway
[09:13:12] <mikesherov> looks like Opera 11.5 is intermittent
[09:13:13] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #150: STILL FAILING in 18 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/150/
[09:13:14] <jq-jenkins> dave.methvin: Ensure that IE stays in Big Boy mode.
[09:13:17] <DaveMethvin> because it's inside an iframe
[09:13:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah JENKINS WE KNOW
[09:13:34] <mikesherov> The real fix is not browser sniffing
[09:13:37] <DaveMethvin> so the testswarm would need the x-ua-compat
[09:13:39] <gnarf> mikesherov: btw - https://gist.github.com/54829d408993526fe475 -- not sure if you can think of anything missing here ( cc @kswedberg )
[09:14:17] <mikesherov> sounds like either we need to fix our tests to not sniff, or we need QUnit to add an option to add that to head
[09:14:42] <DaveMethvin> i think it's testswarm that needs to change, but i agree we should fix those tests
[09:16:15] <kswedberg> gnarf: wow. looks great! Looks like I gotta start diving in to see how this all works.
[09:17:28] <mikesherov> OK, if I have a few minutes today, I can open a PR... but the quickest and dirtiest fix DaveMethvin is to check for document.compatMode
[09:17:32] <mikesherov> g2g
[09:17:39] <mikesherov> bye!
[09:17:46] <kswedberg> bye mikesherov!
[09:17:55] <kswedberg>  gnarf: does jQuery.Tween replace jQuery.fx?
[09:19:02] <kswedberg> or just jQuery.Tween.propHooks replace jQuery.fx.step ?
[09:36:49] <gnarf> kswedberg: both
[09:37:01] <kswedberg> ok.
[09:37:22] <gnarf> like the properties that were hiding on jQuery.fx are still there
[09:37:28] <gnarf> but the Tween replaces it
[09:38:01] <kswedberg> so jQuery.Tween.off == jQuery.fx.off ?
[09:38:26] <gnarf> yes, but I think I'm still going to prefer jQuery.fx.off jQuery.fx.interval
[09:38:38] <gnarf> but jQuery.Tween === jQuery.fx for now to provide Back Compat
[09:40:59] <kswedberg> ok. the done, always, fail callbacks are options just like complete, duration, easing, etc?
[09:41:17] <kswedberg> or are they more like done, always, fail on $.ajax?
[09:41:46] <kswedberg> methods of the returned Promise
[09:42:22] <gnarf> The former if you're using a $.fn.animate
[09:42:24] <kswedberg> I guess they'd have to be the former. otherwise, no chaining on the jQuery object
[09:42:30] <gnarf> yeah
[09:42:31] <kswedberg> right on
[09:42:44] <gnarf> if you use jQuery.Animate to make the animation instead you get the full promise
[09:43:43] <kswedberg> which is different from jQuery.Animation() ?
[09:48:41] <gnarf> what you said was what my sleepy head meant
[09:49:06] <gnarf> Just FYI - the callbacks aren't in git yet
[09:49:10] <gnarf> but they should land soon
[09:49:22] <gnarf> I gotta fix a couple of things before I file the pull
[09:49:35] <gnarf> ( the callback options that is, the promise from jQuery.Animation() works
[10:53:26] <kswedberg> cool. thanks!
[10:53:35] <kswedberg> ↑ gnarf
[10:57:20] <gnarf> kswedberg: np
[10:57:22] <gnarf> kswedberg: I just hope it makes enough sense to distill it down a bit more
[10:58:45] <kswedberg> gnarf: I think it's a great start, and collectively we'll be able to get it into the api docs in a good form
[11:00:15] <kswedberg> gnarf: so, it looks like there are two new methods to document: jQuery.Animation and jQuery.Tween. (maybe jQuery.timers??). and the jQuery.fn animation methods will need updates
[11:00:20] <kswedberg> correct?
[11:01:17] <gnarf> yeah - I really think we should just make an "animation options" page tho
[11:01:24] <gnarf> and link to it from the description of the others
[11:01:42] <gnarf> oh wait
[11:01:47] <gnarf> damn
[11:01:48] <gnarf> no dave
[11:02:12] <gnarf> I was just thinking that it might be time to start suggesting animate( props, opts ) form instead of ( props, speed, callback )
[11:02:42] <gnarf> not that i think we can get rid of the speed, callback syntax
[11:02:54] <gnarf> but i'd like to see the "options" more obvious
[11:03:17] <gnarf> like http://api.jquery.com/slideToggle/
[11:03:27] <gnarf> that should be able to take .slideToggle( opts )
[11:03:56] <kswedberg> gnarf: yes!
[11:04:00] <gnarf> it does
[11:04:03] <gnarf> its just not doced
[11:04:08] <kswedberg> yes!
[11:04:10] <kswedberg> :)
[11:04:15] <kswedberg> I'm working on the docs.
[11:04:24] <gnarf> anything that takes speed, easing, callback form
[11:04:29] <gnarf> can take opts instead of those 3
[11:04:49] <kswedberg> I'm agreeing. those things need to be documented. and I'd like us to start recommending .animate(props, opts) too
[11:05:14] <gnarf> slideToggle({ duration: 200, complete: callback }) works too
[11:06:08] <gnarf> im also trying to think if there is anything else we want to deprecate there
[11:06:09] <gnarf> oh
[11:06:34] <gnarf> I want to deprecate the "per property easing" method of { property: [ value, easing ] }
[11:07:01] <gnarf> instead preferring the { specialEasing: {property: easing} } option
[11:07:47] <gnarf> the former makes it impossible for animate to smartly deal with "array values"
[11:08:31] <gnarf> because it always assumes any array value is [ value, easing ]
[11:08:45] <gnarf> it does no check to see if easing is even an easing func or anything
[11:47:10] <gibson042> timmywil: you there?
[17:40:21] <Krinkle> .
[23:08:17] <gnarf> ircjsbot: tell gibson042 I updated that WIP branch again - i added +1 but I think this makes just as much sense, also moved the callback attching to the actual jQuery.Animation instead of $.fn.animate
[23:08:18] <ircjsbot> gnarf, OK, I will tell gibson042 if I see them.
