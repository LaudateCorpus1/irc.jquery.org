[09:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Can you log the code inside Release.exec() and run the release script again?
[09:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to try running it locally right now as well.
[09:46:29] <DaveMethvin> i thought I'd try it without the changes in each to be sure our baseline is sane
[09:46:39] <DaveMethvin> just a sec, merging in a different PR

[10:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: The grunt task finished fine for me.
[10:05:54] <DaveMethvin> i'm running it now
[10:06:49] <DaveMethvin> ugh, now it's complaining because the old version i had installed the previous commitplease that needed admin
[10:07:08] <DaveMethvin> and now i have polluted this with files that can't be deleted without admin
[10:07:13] <DaveMethvin> so let me try to clean this up
[10:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[10:12:55] <DaveMethvin> this is why i really dislike anything that requires admin
[10:13:02] <scott_gonzalez> As do I.
[10:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> But I just chown /usr/local and most admin-related issues go away.
[10:14:09] <scott_gonzalez> Why did commitplease require admin in the first place?
[10:14:19] <scott_gonzalez> It was just editing files inside your checkout.
[10:14:20] <DaveMethvin> hard links need admin in windows
[10:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's dumb.
[10:14:34] <DaveMethvin> i don't make the rules
[10:14:36] <DaveMethvin> i agree
[10:17:00] <DaveMethvin> well fuck, the path names are too long
[10:17:44] <DaveMethvin> c:\wamp\www\jquery-release\node_modules\lodash._createwrapper\node_modules\lodash._basecreatewrapper\node_modules\lodash.isobject
[10:18:04] <DaveMethvin> that doesn't seem too long
[10:19:03] <DaveMethvin> oh wait, it's C:\wamp\www\jquery-release\__release\repo\node_modules\grunt-jscs-checker\node_modules\lodash.assign\node_modules\lodash._basecreatecallback\node_modules\lodash.bind\node_modules\lodash._createwrapper\node_modules\lodash._basecreatewrapper\node_modules\lodash.isobject
[10:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG
[10:19:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's 268 and i think i get 260
[10:20:01] <gnarf> rxaviers: you should be able to op in #jquery-meeting -- /msg chanserv op #jquery-meeting -- 
[10:20:16] <rxaviers> gnarf, ah! cool. Let me check
[10:21:15] <rxaviers> gnarf, \o/ worked like a charm
[10:21:18] <rxaviers> thanks!
[10:21:38] <DaveMethvin> so from that nasty path it looks like lodash has broken itself into little pieces-parts that get fetched from npm?
[10:21:40] <DaveMethvin> let me look
[10:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, lodash has a module for every function.
[10:22:17] <DaveMethvin> well this is the result
[10:22:52] <DaveMethvin> npm doesn't seem like the right tool for managing dependencies like this
[10:23:41] <DaveMethvin> i'll report an issue against lodash
[10:23:43] <scott_gonzalez> You can plea for grunt-jscs-checker to stop requiring a single function.
[10:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'm shocked that _.extend() needs that many dependencies.
[10:26:45] <DaveMethvin> it's just using _.extend() ?????
[10:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:27:53] <DaveMethvin> geez
[10:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> All of those nested deps are for this one line: https://github.com/gustavohenke/grunt-jscs-checker/blob/master/tasks/lib/jscs.js#L83
[10:29:05] <DaveMethvin> well i'm sure those dependencies are for all the parts that were factored so they can be common, given the names
[10:29:12] <DaveMethvin> but what a mess
[10:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Can you chime in on https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/pull/61 ?
[10:32:47] <scott_gonzalez> It didn't seem like you asked him to document installing individual files from the CDN through Bower.
[10:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> That just seems like a strange thing for us to put on the download page.
[10:33:24] <scott_gonzalez> Especially since it contains a version number.
[10:34:33] <DaveMethvin> I don't want anything long but would like something similar to what we say for the CDNs, which is "here is a way to load jQuery and go find more information here"
[10:37:31] <scott_gonzalez> Right, that's what I was expecting.
[10:37:48] <DaveMethvin> and the same for npm
[10:37:48] <scott_gonzalez> Basically the first half of what he wrote.
[10:37:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:38:10] <DaveMethvin> i think i'll just write something myself and give a thanks to him
[10:38:25] <DaveMethvin> we just want to link to bower for details
[10:38:29] <DaveMethvin> as we do for google cdn
[10:43:57] <DaveMethvin> not sure why everyone thinks micro-dependency-management is so much more trouble-free than just including a lump of code
[10:44:15] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/lodash/lodash/issues/501
[11:03:03] <snover> DaveMethvin: BECAUSE WHAT IF YOU WANT TO SAVE 200 BYTES BY NOT INCLUDING IT MAN
[11:04:02] <DaveMethvin> well no problem snover you just use an extra 2700 bytes of disk space and pull down 40 more modules to get the parts you really want and not waste those 200 byts
[11:05:13] <snover> WHATEVER MAN ZEPTO IS THE FUTURE
[11:05:54] <snover> i love this so much
[11:06:15] <snover> mikeal‚Äôs arrogance towards me about how node modules are perfect and amazing
[11:06:23] <snover> crumbling on yet another front
[11:06:36] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/joyent/node/issues/6960
[11:07:18] <snover> in b4 ‚Äúwell windows isn‚Äôt good so you should just use something unix-based‚Äù
[11:08:09] <DaveMethvin> using the file system as a module dependency tree does feel very unixy, i'll give you that for sure
[11:08:47] <DaveMethvin> maybe git should give up on its proprietary formats and use dirs too
[11:08:57] <DaveMethvin> just like CVS and Visual Sourcesafe did
[11:09:03] <DaveMethvin> they were good enough for grandpa
[11:09:09] <snover> i‚Äôve never heard anything bad about CVS or VSS, ever
[11:09:18] <snover> so this sounds good to me
[11:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Can you test the release PR?
[11:09:27] <snover> since i have heard a lot about how complicated git is
[11:09:34] <snover> this sounds much simpler
[11:09:55] <snover> git2: index.html index.html.old index.html.old.old index.html.old.old.old
[11:10:03] <snover> it‚Äôs so easy to look back in time
[11:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> snover: It'd probably be more like VMS with index.html, index.html.1, index.html.2
[11:11:08] <scott_gonzalez> Though hopefully they wouldn't introduce `git2 purge` which would kill all history :-P
[11:11:24] <DaveMethvin> i can't believe you know about vms scott_gonzalez 
[11:11:34] <scott_gonzalez> I used it in college :-)
[11:11:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah ... i probably used it before you were in college :P
[11:11:54] <scott_gonzalez> Not on my personal machines, but I logged in remotely for FORTRAN and COBOL :-P
[11:12:50] <scott_gonzalez> We had a room we called the VAX Cave.
[11:12:50] <DaveMethvin> okay since i'm screwed on the release script imma continue to land these little prs 
[11:16:00] <DaveMethvin> oh ffs trac
[11:19:53] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: sorry, I'm really busy with work right now
[11:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:20:55] <timmywil> I could probably take a look in a couple hours
[11:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be great.
[11:24:33] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
