[07:54:38] <DaveMethvin> damn, both the api site and the bugs site are dying today
[07:55:01] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: any ideas about that? Maybe we're under attack?
[07:55:35] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov said he knows trac pretty well and could help out if we needed it
[07:56:28] <danheberden> so the bugs site wasn't any better since yesterday?
[07:57:02] <danheberden> api site got upgraded yesterday or the day before
[07:57:11] <danheberden> hopefully that isn't the cause of this :/
[07:57:24] <danheberden> cuz i'm having troubles even connecting to it to ssh in
[07:58:08] <danheberden> holy httpd processed batman!
[08:02:22] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/'s not loading for me
[08:05:37] <danheberden> it shouldn't be, it's off
[08:05:49] <danheberden> even with httpd and mysqld killed, it's being really slow with nothing running
[08:05:56] <danheberden> i'm wondering if this is mt failing
[08:32:18] <gnarf> danheberden: iostat ?
[08:32:21] <gnarf> lots of swap?
[08:32:37] <danheberden> gnarf: i cant even connect to it now
[08:32:41] <danheberden> on hold with (mt)
[08:32:51] <danheberden> "the estimated hold time is currently twelve minutes"
[08:33:07] <gnarf> fun
[08:33:11] <danheberden> ya
[08:33:36] <danheberden> and i can't ssh into bugs either
[08:33:45] <danheberden> i made a support ticket for that like 3 days ago
[08:33:53] <danheberden> and they said they can ssh fine :/
[08:34:05] * danheberden pounds fist on desk
[08:38:44] <danheberden> whoa it finally booted
[08:39:23] <gnarf> it was the fist pounding
[08:40:37] <danheberden> gnarf http://danheberden.com/share/3c163.png
[08:41:29] <gnarf> woah!
[08:41:32] <gnarf> load 36?
[08:41:34] <gnarf> thats insane
[08:42:28] <gnarf> danheberden: still got my pubkey?
[08:42:31] <gnarf> throw it on docs
[08:42:38] <gnarf> i wanna peek closer at that one
[08:43:02] <gnarf> pm'ed the pubkey in case you didn't have it
[09:41:59] <danheberden> gnarf got load average below 4
[09:42:23] <danheberden> and the site is responding the way you'd expect now
[09:56:03] <gnarf> nice
[09:56:13] <gnarf> that other cache plugin behaving better?
[10:05:04] <danheberden> gnarf omg so much better
[10:05:10] <danheberden> load is like .5 now
[10:05:17] <danheberden> and it's zippy as hell
[10:05:21] <gnarf> nice
[10:05:33] <danheberden> side note, totally blaming kswedberg for updating wp
[10:05:57] <danheberden> but only cuz i know it'll get him in the mood to give me a hug
[10:08:35] <danheberden> DaveMethvin ruby has the error message javascript should have: `RuntimeError: can't add a new key into hash during iteration`
[10:09:58] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: Translation: "Yer doin it rong"
[10:10:24] <danheberden> haha, exactly!
[10:15:34] <tbranyen> sup mr burke
[10:15:50] <tbranyen> jrburke: i had a question for you if you have a min, mind if i pm?
[10:16:22] <jrburke> hi tbranyen
[10:16:25] <jrburke> sure
[10:27:21] <jzaefferer> hey jrburke, got a question, too, no need for PM though. Planning a workshop that, among other stuff, covers client side dependency managment. I want to use require.js for that. Do you know of any webinars or tutorials that could be used as a starting point?
[10:34:51] <jrburke> jzaefferer: hmm, i'm not aware of one, these resources might be useful:
[10:37:31] <jrburke> jzaefferer: http://integralist.co.uk/post/11705798780/beginners-guide-to-amd-and-requirejs  http://requirejs.org/docs/start.html http://requirejs.org/docs/jquery.html
[10:38:33] <jrburke> jzaefferer: you can also use volojs to use a command line command to pull down a simple template project that has requirejs included: https://github.com/volojs/volo
[10:38:35] <jzaefferer> thanks jrburke; was already looking at the two requirejs.org pages, good to have another tutorial
[10:39:04] <jzaefferer> will take a look at that, too
[10:49:47] <kswedberg> ohai danheberden: hugzzzz!!
[10:50:00] <danheberden> kswedberg :)
[10:50:32] <kswedberg> danheberden: I like to think of it as the wp upgrade exposed a flaw that was already there. ;)
[10:50:52] <danheberden> i'm sure that's it :p
[10:51:00] <danheberden> i think that plugin was just garbage
[10:51:11] <Clooth> Buying a life.
[10:51:12] <kswedberg> which one? wp-total-cache?
[10:51:18] <danheberden> the site actually ran better when i disabled it
[10:51:28] <danheberden> yah, total cache
[10:52:34] <kswedberg> danheberden: huh. weird. it's definitely finicky. like, you have to have everything set just right for your particular server or it all comes crumbling down.
[10:53:21] <danheberden> oh it did- it was so slow haha
[11:56:28] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: When core does releases, do you link to the CDNs before they're updated?
[11:56:38] <scott_gonzalez> Or do you add the links to the blog post after the CDNs are updated?
[11:56:51] <DaveMethvin> i have tried both ways, it just causes different styles of bitching :D
[11:57:00] <scott_gonzalez> Heh
[11:57:13] <scott_gonzalez> What is your plan for the 1.7.2 release?
[11:57:25] <scott_gonzalez> We're going to switch from using the Google CDN to code.jquery for jqueryui.com
[11:57:30] <DaveMethvin> haven't thought about it yet ...
[11:57:33] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll no longer be waiting for the CDNs to update before announcing.
[11:57:38] <DaveMethvin> well a lot of people want the google cdn
[11:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to do whatever you do :-P
[11:57:48] <DaveMethvin> esp because it supports https
[11:58:13] <DaveMethvin> why you would ever include someone else's code on a truly secure site is beyond me
[11:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> The MS CDN supports HTTPS
[11:58:43] <scott_gonzalez> And they update immediately :-)
[11:58:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah but people want the google one
[11:58:47] <DaveMethvin> like by 10 to 1
[11:59:01] <DaveMethvin> i agree ms is MUCH faster, like hours
[11:59:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, well MS is faster than Google, like by 100 to 1
[11:59:10] <DaveMethvin> for 1.7.0 it took a week
[11:59:19] <scott_gonzalez> for 1.8.17, it took 2 months...
[11:59:23] <DaveMethvin> so 100 is about right
[11:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> well, like 1.5 months
[11:59:47] <scott_gonzalez> but yeah, ~1wk is typical for Google
[11:59:51] <DaveMethvin> i think i will link to the ultimate destination and note that it will be there when it is there
[11:59:58] <DaveMethvin> and to stfu if it is not
[12:00:10] <DaveMethvin> or words to that effect :P
[12:00:10] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds like a good plan.
[12:00:23] <DaveMethvin> obtw how is the ms tablet thing going?
[12:01:11] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[12:01:50] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/interactions/ui/jquery.ui.interaction.js#L159 :-)
[12:02:17] <DaveMethvin> hey that looks like progress!
[12:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> Still lots of testing to do with various pointer devices, but I can use draggable with touch on the tablet :-)
[12:02:43] <DaveMethvin> sweet
[12:17:34] <gibson042> .
[12:19:04] <gibson042> timmywil: you there?
[12:19:35] <timmywil> somewhat
[12:21:18] <gibson042> DaveMethvin wants to roll #11109 into the Sizzle revamp, because it's a Sizzle bug... where should Sizzle bugs be filed?
[12:21:54] <gibson042> for future reference, and to make sure that this one doesn't get lost
[12:22:35] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues
[12:22:48] <DaveMethvin> and thanks for all the great pull requests gibson042!
[12:23:21] <gibson042> excellent; I'm glad I did find it (if a little late)
[12:23:31] <gibson042> and it's been my pleasure to give back to jquery
[12:23:56] <DaveMethvin> well we definitely appreciate the help
[12:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Any idea why trying to SSH to code.jquery.com would hang?
[12:24:37] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez cuz you can't
[12:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> Since when?
[12:26:05] <danheberden> SINCE I SAID SO
[12:26:06] <danheberden> also, never :(
[12:34:13] <gibson042> timmywil: if you do want to break out or offload some of #10697, I'd love to pitch in there too
[12:35:49] <timmywil> gibson042: for now, I'll need to do it all at once, but I will take your pull into account.  Once I finish rewriting, helping with bugs will be back to normal
[12:36:25] <gibson042> k, thanks
[12:52:04] <timmywil> jrburke: do you think you'll be able to maintain an amd fork for backbone?
[12:52:32] <timmywil> a hassle i know, but I'd use it
[12:53:59] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin let's change that data ticket to "patchwelcome"
[12:54:13] <rwaldron> it will be fun to shoot down all the attempts that wont work
[12:54:16] <DaveMethvin> well i don't want to get anyone's hopes up
[12:54:24] <DaveMethvin> that will just piss them off
[12:54:48] <DaveMethvin> i was not a fan of it, and still am not, but i t hink too much code depends on it now
[12:54:49] <rwaldron> "patchwelcome" we're not going to fix it, but youre welcome to try
[12:54:50] <jrburke> timmywil: looks like i'll have to now. ;) i'll more likely look at how best to do a format conversion though, something that could be run as part of volo: https://github.com/volojs/volo but backbone will be awkward since it looks for globals for its dependencies.
[13:03:16] <timmywil> jrburke: the main argument seems to be that es.next modules aren't the same as amd, but it seems to me that neither is commonjs and the node environment will change in the future too.
[13:03:50] <timmywil> that's a poorly constructed sentence
[13:05:39] <timmywil> backbone supports commonjs modules, but when es.next modules become more commonplace, my guess is that node will be persuaded to change with it.
[13:06:55] <jrburke> timmywil: to me, the main argument is that amd is not popular enough, so they do not know if it is the right way forward. Plus their typical development is done using ruby on rails and just needing a few scripts on a page. but yeah, the point about having to do some sort of API call does not ring true. there will be some sort of api call/syntax call to do any type of module development. oh well, just needs more time.
[13:07:21] <timmywil> i guess so
[13:08:16] <jrburke> you can bring a horse to water, but cannot make it drink. need to wait until it gets thirsty. :)
[13:08:17] <timmywil> is there some other browser module spec I don't know about or just script loaders doing their own thing?
[13:08:37] <rwaldron> I have a proposal...
[13:08:43] <rwaldron> jQuery.rtfm()
[13:08:48] <rwaldron> returns a link to the api docs
[13:09:03] <rwaldron> ... i jsut read through all the bug mail from today
[13:09:07] <rwaldron> you guys were busy
[13:11:07] <jrburke> timmywil: well yahoo has a module api. but there is nothing close to amd, which has multiple independent implementations.

[14:34:52] <mikesherov> bug tracker is getting slower by the day

[14:44:40] <danheberden> mikesherov can you pm me your ssh key?
[14:44:49] <danheberden> it'd be cool if you could take a peek at it
[14:45:18] <danheberden> i was hoping upgrading mysql would help the thread issue
[14:45:24] <danheberden> since it seems to be a closed issue with trac :/

[20:09:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's like december 23
[20:09:45] <mikesherov> Oh SNAP
[20:09:48] <DaveMethvin> no december 21
[20:09:51] <mikesherov> Just in time
[20:10:02] <mikesherov> hey, how do I get listed on this page: https://github.com/jquery
[20:10:10] <mikesherov> as an organization member
[20:10:26] <DaveMethvin> good question
[20:10:46] <DaveMethvin> heckifino
[20:10:49] <danheberden> mikesherov you have to click "publicize membership"
[20:10:56] <mikesherov> OK
[20:11:04] <danheberden> go to github.com
[20:11:07] <danheberden> switch organizations
[20:11:21] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i see "conceal membership" next to my name
[20:11:37] <DaveMethvin> i only do that for my github.com/donkeyporn membership
[20:12:05] <danheberden> oh, ya, right there
[20:12:12] <danheberden> DaveMethvin love that repo, btw
[20:12:26] <mikesherov> LOL
[20:12:30] <DaveMethvin> those donkeys do the darnedest things
[20:13:18] <mikesherov> hdanheberden: where is that setting?
[20:13:46] <mikesherov> danheberden: where is that setting?
[20:13:56] <danheberden> looks like it might be just github.com/jquery
[20:14:22] <danheberden> look for the work publicize
[20:14:26] <danheberden> *word
[20:14:45] <mikesherov> not on the page
[20:14:57] <danheberden> what's your github user name?
[20:15:16] <mikesherov> mikesherov
[20:15:34] <danheberden> weird, you aren't on the list
[20:15:34] <danheberden> haha
[20:15:49] <mikesherov> right, I was never added as part of my "official" induction
[20:16:06] <mikesherov> I was added to the team page on jquery.org and got a mention in the blog post
[20:16:10] <mikesherov> which was AWESOME
[20:16:12] <danheberden> do you have commit access?
[20:16:16] <mikesherov> No, I don't
[20:16:20] <danheberden> you have to have commit access to be on that page
[20:16:25] <danheberden> but un momento
[20:16:41] <DaveMethvin> wow, all those ppl have commit? I guess its for all the repos
[20:16:47] <mikesherov> No way! rwldrn doesn't have commit access, and he's on it
[20:16:59] <mikesherov> are you sure?
[20:17:34] <mikesherov> I don't need commit access, I can just keep bugging DaveMethvin :-)
[20:17:36] <danheberden> you aren't getting commit on jquery silly
[20:17:41] <danheberden> i don't make that call :)
[20:17:51] <DaveMethvin> heck i can't even add anyone
[20:18:00] <danheberden> but i can add you to a diff repo
[20:18:04] <mikesherov> No, I mean, are you sure I have to have commit access to be on the organization?
[20:18:04] <danheberden> and you can be on that list at least :)
[20:18:11] <danheberden> mikesherov ya
[20:18:14] <danheberden> to at least ONE of the repos
[20:18:22] <DaveMethvin> ok that makes sense
[20:18:22] <danheberden> so, like, those people have access to like jqm or learning or whatevs
[20:18:41] <danheberden> so now you can be on the list
[20:18:44] <danheberden> cuz you deserve to be
[20:19:01] * danheberden removes DaveMethvin
[20:19:05] <danheberden> not like that guy does anything
[20:19:06] <mikesherov> COOL
[20:19:07] <DaveMethvin> finally!
[20:19:10] <danheberden> haha
[20:19:16] <danheberden> <3 u dave
[20:19:18] <mikesherov> Thanks!
[20:19:20] <DaveMethvin> awww
[20:19:24] <danheberden> of course
[20:19:57] <danheberden> i'm sure you'll be on all kinds of repos soon enough
[20:20:19] <danheberden> and then you'll be like "OMG WHAT HAVE I DONE?!"
[20:20:23] <mikesherov> LOL
[20:20:41] <mikesherov> I think you can set up a "team" that only has pull access btw, for future reference
[20:20:53] <DaveMethvin> where's teh fun in that?
[20:20:56] <danheberden> correct
[20:21:01] <danheberden> but tha'ts more work
[20:21:06] <danheberden> and i'm def too lazy
[20:21:11] <DaveMethvin> confirm
[20:21:12] <DaveMethvin> lol
[20:21:18] <danheberden> these servers don't just crash themselves ya know!
[20:21:22] <mikesherov> LOL
[20:21:26] <danheberden> i, err, mean fix.. I MEAN FIX
[20:21:40] <mikesherov> speaking of which, I wonder when the last backup of Trac was
[20:21:47] <danheberden> hahahaha
[20:21:50] <danheberden> you're a funny guy mike
[20:21:51] <DaveMethvin> cmon now, you have some script that hoses the cache in wp just so you can look like a hero
[20:22:01] <danheberden> DaveMethvin planned it well, too
[20:22:08] <danheberden> waited for karl to upgrade wp
[20:22:14] <danheberden> then BOOM
[20:22:42] <mikesherov> No, but honestly, we need to set up replication on the bug tracker db
[20:22:47] <mikesherov> it's scary
[20:22:47] <danheberden> it's in my okcupid profile: "likes long walks on the beach, sabotaging servers to be the hero, setting homes on fire and rescuing children out of them"
[20:22:54] <danheberden> mikesherov dude, you have no idea
[20:22:56] <danheberden> it's ALL scary
[20:23:22] <mikesherov> oh shucks
[20:23:31] * danheberden signs mikesherov up for infra
[20:23:47] <mikesherov> I'll gladly help out
[20:23:49] <danheberden> congratulations mikesherov, your'e the new lead of infrastrucure!
[20:23:54] <mikesherov> HUZZAH
[20:23:59] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: he knows too much about trac, he must be eliminated
[20:24:09] <danheberden> lol
[20:24:19] <mikesherov> step 1: get a backup schedule in place for all critical databases
[20:24:23] <mikesherov> step 2: ???
[20:24:27] <danheberden> did you pm me your key mikesherov?
[20:24:28] <mikesherov> step 3: profit
[20:24:34] <danheberden> i'd love you to take a look at that box
[20:24:55] <mikesherov> No, I never did
[20:25:17] <danheberden> `cat .ssh/id_pub.rsa | pbcopy` that shiz
[20:25:40] <mikesherov> We left it at I would gladly help out, but I would never touch a not backed-up, non redundant, unfamiliar system
[20:26:13] <mikesherov> I'm a bit crazy, but not THAT crazy
[20:26:15] <mikesherov> :-)
[20:26:43] <mikesherov> Your trac skills are pretty freaking sweet
[20:26:54] <mikesherov> or whoever set up that voting script is pretty wicked
[20:27:39] <danheberden> that was john
[20:27:44] <mikesherov> interesting
[20:27:54] <danheberden> he's one of them python weirdos
[20:27:56] <danheberden> you know the ones
[20:27:59] <DaveMethvin> oh i found the video of danheberden running the trac server http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hoJfi9kPh0
[20:28:07] <danheberden> *ruining
[20:28:20] <mikesherov> TROLOLOLO
[20:28:25] <danheberden> in shark infested waters no less!
[20:28:39] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: that mystifying PR I have there
[20:28:50] <mikesherov> the one about zoom magically fixing a layout issue
[20:28:54] <DaveMethvin> right
[20:29:01] <mikesherov> need clarification?
[20:29:18] <DaveMethvin> other than "MAGIC?" naw
[20:29:18] <danheberden> "get claritin clear"
[20:29:46] <DaveMethvin> you're doing hte hasLayout thing?
[20:30:11] <DaveMethvin> but it's just before you yank it out of the doc, that's what has me confused
[20:30:41] <mikesherov> Yeah, I looked at it
[20:30:56] <mikesherov> and I said "this probably just needs a reflow"
[20:31:03] <mikesherov> and gosh darn it, it worked
[20:31:14] <DaveMethvin> oh right, you had to force the reflow
[20:31:35] <DaveMethvin> which you had to do before you removed it from the doc
[20:31:44] <mikesherov> I didn't put too much effort in it because I cut the offending code out in the "simplify offset" commit
[20:32:18] <DaveMethvin> ok that's enough of an excuse :P
[20:32:41] <mikesherov> I mean, it's going to live for the duration of 1.7.2 to 1.8
[20:32:52] <mikesherov> it's basically shutting up the person who submitted the PR
[20:32:58] <mikesherov> OOps
[20:33:04] <mikesherov> I mean the bug report
[20:33:12] <gnarf> danheberden: don't go givin mikesherov my job
[20:33:13] <gnarf> :)
[20:33:21] <gnarf> i want that shit in your jQuery will
[20:33:21] <mikesherov> There he is
[20:33:30] <gnarf> "gnarf gets infra"
[20:33:41] <danheberden> gnarf lol, do i have to die first?
[20:33:41] <mikesherov> Wait, so do we really not backup Trac ever?
[20:33:48] <DaveMethvin> don't fight boys, there's plenty of chaos to go around
[20:33:49] <danheberden> mikesherov i back it up when i get the itch
[20:33:55] <danheberden> but not on a schedule
[20:33:58] <gnarf> danheberden: nah, just like die on the team
[20:33:59] <mikesherov> hmmm
[20:34:04] <gnarf> that could mean giving it up
[20:34:06] <danheberden> gnarf oy!
[20:34:06] <gnarf> whatevs
[20:34:28] <danheberden> i'm going to restructure that a little bit gnarf
[20:34:31] <mikesherov> what is that box? managed? colo? virtual? dedicated?
[20:34:39] <danheberden> so you'll theoretically be server lead
[20:34:45] <gnarf> ooo
[20:34:49] <gnarf> one more title
[20:34:53] * gnarf collects titles
[20:34:57] <mikesherov> What would it take to get a slave server for it?
[20:34:58] <danheberden> well, "infrastructure" is a bit vague
[20:35:03] <gnarf> true
[20:35:09] <danheberden> mikesherov about 2 months of prodding a hosting company
[20:35:10] <danheberden> :/
[20:35:27] <gnarf> hey - check out my skill build for TOR - http://r2-db.com/skill-tree/calculator/7/imperial-agent/operative#build=0i00000000f3c187ekk6kc00000000 :)
[20:35:28] <mikesherov> mediatemple?
[20:35:35] <DaveMethvin> don't they know we need moar free servers?
[20:35:49] <gnarf> ( i was just working a LONG time on that page, so sorry to spam random shit )
[20:36:24] <danheberden> that looks neat gnarf
[20:36:28] <danheberden> mikesherov ya
[20:36:42] <danheberden> DaveMethvin supposedly soon, chris lea is working his magic
[20:37:15] <mikesherov> What kind of box? I mean what kind of value are we getting?
[20:37:31] <DaveMethvin> free
[20:37:42] <mikesherov> I *might* be able to get my company to sponsor a box
[20:37:59] <mikesherov> Like, what would the cost of sponsoring a box be
[20:38:00] <DaveMethvin> supposedly MT is ok for giving us whatever
[20:38:14] <mikesherov> OK, so it's just waiting for them to do it
[20:38:18] <DaveMethvin> it's just hard to get them to do it sometimes
[20:38:23] <danheberden> yeah, it's some boxes equivelant to their 'nitro' line
[20:38:31] <mikesherov> yeah, because we're free
[20:38:38] <gnarf> man
[20:38:56] <gnarf> i really feel like booking a trip to oxford for this UK conf ;)
[20:39:02] <mikesherov> So, Orkel was right, btw
[20:39:03] <danheberden> so 16core raid10 cool stuff
[20:39:09] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[20:39:11] <mikesherov> we say we don't support Safari4
[20:39:30] <DaveMethvin> we are gonna do some serious trimming here, sounds like
[20:39:34] <mikesherov> But we clearly have to to support jQM
[20:39:49] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ?
[20:40:06] <DaveMethvin> lookign at some of the PRs
[20:40:13] <mikesherov> Yes
[20:40:21] <mikesherov> the simplify offset is a major trim
[20:40:36] <DaveMethvin> who knew that JQM would be the reason we had to keep old lumps of code?
[20:40:46] <DaveMethvin> here we were worried about IE
[20:41:15] <mikesherov> well, that's why I keep saying, what browsers do we support
[20:41:20] <mikesherov> and if jQM relies on us
[20:41:25] <mikesherov> we gotta support their browsers
[20:41:33] <mikesherov> I have an email thread going with that team
[20:41:45] <DaveMethvin> although..."support" is relative
[20:41:50] <mikesherov> Yes
[20:41:56] <mikesherov> that's what I'm wrestling with
[20:41:58] <mikesherov> exactly that
[20:42:16] <danheberden> "kindly give consideration to"
[20:42:30] <DaveMethvin> also it might be possible to push some of the fix responsibility to jQM in some cases
[20:42:36] <DaveMethvin> if only they need the fix
[20:42:41] <mikesherov> and basically, it looks like every time we attempt to cut a support test, we have to make a build and send it to them so they can test how it would effect the support for jQM
[20:42:50] <DaveMethvin> oh joy
[20:42:59] <mikesherov> that's as far as I've gotten
[20:43:05] <mikesherov> it's not ideal, but it's a start
[20:43:08] <DaveMethvin> which reminds me, i wanted to take most of jQuery.support out of the public interface
[20:43:16] <mikesherov> YES
[20:43:24] <mikesherov> take it ALL out
[20:43:33] <mikesherov> burn it to the freaking ground
[20:43:48] <DaveMethvin> i know there are some plugins and such that depend on it
[20:44:03] <DaveMethvin> we took something out a while back and someone complained
[20:44:17] <DaveMethvin> but damned if we'lll leave that stuff in if we don't need it
[20:44:31] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately we're kind of breaking the public api the way we've set it up
[20:44:34] <gnarf> add it to the "bc" plugin
[20:44:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah but we need to deprecate it first :D
[20:45:05] <mikesherov> NO
[20:45:07] <DaveMethvin> might as well wave them off the whole thing
[20:45:08] <mikesherov> I'm sorry
[20:45:19] <mikesherov> the simplify offset thing is getting cut straight out
[20:45:28] <mikesherov> no deprecation, just surgery
[20:45:42] <DaveMethvin> oh definitely for that
[20:45:47] <mikesherov> pheew
[20:45:55] <mikesherov> I almost had a heart attack
[20:46:10] <mikesherov> actually, the simplify offset may get even simpler
[20:46:10] <DaveMethvin> or checkClone, which was broken anyway
[20:46:17] <gnarf> you talking about offset support tests?
[20:46:21] <mikesherov> well, orkel fixed it
[20:46:29] <DaveMethvin> right
[20:46:39] <gnarf> yeah, i don't think those are documented
[20:46:42] <mikesherov> orkel closed the PR to cut it because jQM "needs" it
[20:46:50] <mikesherov> what we should really do
[20:47:03] <gnarf> tell them to make their own .support test for it?
[20:47:03] <mikesherov> and I am tempted to just make a ticket for it
[20:47:29] <mikesherov> well, no, it's not something related to jQM code interacting with core code
[20:47:33] <DaveMethvin> i think the compat plugin would be fine
[20:47:39] <mikesherov> it's just a broken thing
[20:48:18] <DaveMethvin> they can certainly do their own support test, or monkey-patch a method if they need to make it work for an old browser
[20:48:26] <mikesherov> we really really really need a ticket that says: "document EVERY support test with what browsers we know it to be effected by, and provide a link to a bug tracker ticket if possible"
[20:48:37] <mikesherov> That's a good idea
[20:48:48] <mikesherov> they can monkey punch the checkClone back in
[20:49:04] <DaveMethvin> yep it's really coming back to bite us that we don't know who these tests were added for
[20:50:09] <mikesherov> I'm willing to sign myself up for the torture
[20:50:22] <mikesherov> I could use a brush up in "git bisect" anyway
[20:50:39] <mikesherov> and it'll help improve my #movethewebforward score
[20:50:53] <gnarf> wait, there's a score?
[20:51:00] <mikesherov> No
[20:51:02] <mikesherov> in my head
[20:51:14] <mikesherov> BUT THERE SHOULD BE A SCORE
[20:51:23] <gnarf> paul_irish: ^^^
[20:51:46] <mikesherov> Oooh
[20:52:15] <mikesherov> I'm off to write a github post receive hook that does just that!
[20:52:39] <DaveMethvin> you guys
[20:52:44] <mikesherov> Every commit you get merged into an open source project: +9000
[20:53:02] <mikesherov> but I digress
[20:53:16] <DaveMethvin> the scores are made up and the points don't matter
[20:53:17] <mikesherov> I would be willing to document EVERY support test in a standard way
[20:53:28] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: tell that to Drew Carey
[20:53:48] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, but like i have 22,048 rep on stack overflow
[20:53:52] <mikesherov> The points are made up on StackOverflow, and I still cared that my "rep" was over 4500
[20:53:55] <mikesherov> JINX
[20:54:04] <DaveMethvin> i'm at like 22 on SO
[20:54:15] <DaveMethvin> i can't get into answering the lame questions :D
[20:54:16] <mikesherov> I have +1000 on cooking.stackexchange.com SO THERE
[20:54:30] <DaveMethvin> i'm inviting you to my next bbq
[20:54:32] <mikesherov> I snipe PHP, jquery, regex, MySQL
[20:54:53] <gnarf> wtf someone downvoted for http://stackoverflow.com/q/1314266/91914
[20:54:55] <mikesherov> I carved out a "steak" and "knives" niche on seasonedadvice
[20:55:16] <mikesherov> there, I just upvoted it
[20:55:28] <mikesherov> LETS GAME THE SYSTEM!!!111
[20:56:24] <mikesherov> Anywho, like I said, maybe I'm just delirious, but I would document every support test if I knew that we would be willing to cut the ones that are no longer in a supported browser
[20:57:15] <mikesherov> none of this "but wait, some crazy plugin relies on it" BS
[20:57:21] <DaveMethvin> well i just updated the description
[20:57:26] <mikesherov> OK, I lied, I'd document them anyway
[20:57:36] <mikesherov> the description on what>
[20:58:02] <DaveMethvin> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[20:58:40] <DaveMethvin> technically we should just not document any of that, otherwise it's what the lawyers call  an "attractive nuisance"
[20:59:44] <mikesherov> right
[21:00:04] <gnarf> i really hate that you need use() in php5.3 btw
[21:00:11] <mikesherov> so just replace that api document page with "Hey guys, if you want to feature detect, use something else, jquery's are not for you"
[21:00:17] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/a/3378842/91914
[21:00:40] <mikesherov> are you scoping me out
[21:00:58] <mikesherov> OH SHIT, NO PUN INTENDED
[21:00:58] <DaveMethvin> DROP TABLE CATEGORIES
[21:01:31] <DaveMethvin> oh damn i'm turning into a pumpkin, gotta go
[21:01:53] <gnarf> hey mikesherov
[21:01:56] <gnarf> that answer
[21:02:18] <mikesherov> what about it
[21:02:20] <gnarf> couldn't you array_walk( $_POST['check_box'], array( $connection, "real_escape_string" ) );
[21:02:21] <gnarf> ?
[21:02:56] <gnarf> or even array_map( array( $connection, "real_escape_string" ), $_POST[ "check_box" ] );
[21:03:41] <mikesherov> Yeah, I just hate that syntax
[21:03:55] <gnarf> :)
[21:04:40] <mikesherov> but that's a great 1 liner
[21:04:56] <mikesherov> I'm from the "expressive code" camp
[21:05:10] <rpflo> wow, I haven't looked at php in a long time
[21:05:33] <mikesherov> I think my answer shows intent a bit better, and therefore serves as a better stackoverflow example
[21:05:50] <mikesherov> but you're way is pretty great
[21:06:25] <mikesherov> wait a sec
[21:06:59] <mikesherov> yeah, yours is pretty great
[21:08:08] <mikesherov> gnarf: this is the best answer I ever gave on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2330902/why-is-the-operator-in-php-working-on-an-object-property/2330914#2330914
[21:09:19] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/a/3314877/91914 is one of my favorite posts :)
[21:09:59] <rpflo> gnarf: that's a blog post.
[21:10:07] <gnarf> that or http://stackoverflow.com/a/2203549/91914
[21:10:20] <gnarf> rpflo: yeah, but i wrote it on stack overflow
[21:11:43] <mikesherov> OH, this one is good too!
[21:11:43] <mikesherov> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2233574/how-to-kill-a-project/2233622#2233622
[21:12:44] <gnarf> that question feels like a programmers.
[21:13:13] <mikesherov> yeah, it was froma  disgruntled employee at a company
[21:13:22] <mikesherov> my answer was: look in the mirror
[21:13:25] * gnarf close votes
[21:14:24] <mikesherov> CLOSE VOTES?
[21:14:29] <mikesherov> It's community wiki
[21:14:37] <gnarf> so, it still belongs on programmers.
[21:14:41] <gnarf> ;)
[21:14:43] <mikesherov> from when only SO,SU,and SF existed
[21:14:54] <gnarf> whats the argument?
[21:15:05] <mikesherov> Um, I dunno
[21:15:06] <gnarf> it will forever live on on SO anyway, just move it to programmers
[21:16:53] <mikesherov> the new jquery style guide is insanity: http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines#Function_Calls
[21:17:30] <mikesherov> 3 exceptions to the function call rule
[21:17:48] <mikesherov> honestly, let's just have a style that can be autoformatted
[21:18:12] <mikesherov> enter code into jsbeautifier, hit beautify, voila
[22:29:34] <paul_irish> mikesherov: the plan on docc'ing those tests sounds awesomeee
