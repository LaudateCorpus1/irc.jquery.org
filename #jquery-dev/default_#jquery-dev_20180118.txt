[14:12:09] <MaryO_> Hey guys, i have a simple question about a simple issue. Can't find anything about it though...
[14:12:23] <MaryO_> I have a .js file, that calls a PHP file from an ajax function
[14:13:18] <MaryO_> i want to reduce the load on the server and cache the php result to be used on other functions in that same JS file
[14:13:31] <MaryO_> :O
[14:30:49] <robertmaxrees> MaryO_ there are a few ways.
[14:31:11] <robertmaxrees> this is a good case for a promise.
