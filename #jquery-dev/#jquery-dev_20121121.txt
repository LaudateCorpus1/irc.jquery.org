[10:09:40] <DaveMethvin> paging mikesherov, dr sherov, you're wanted in surgery
[10:09:56] <mikesherov> Hi
[10:10:03] <DaveMethvin> hey, how are things going?
[10:10:09] <mikesherov> Good
[10:10:23] <DaveMethvin> i was just trudging thru the  new tix
[10:10:25] <mikesherov> What's up dr Methvin?
[10:10:30] <DaveMethvin> what do you think on this one http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12883
[10:10:40] <DaveMethvin> i'm not a real dr i just play one on irc
[10:11:28] <DaveMethvin> oh trac, y u so slow
[10:11:28] <b-ot> (Â±Æ'–î')Â±Æ
[10:11:40] <mikesherov> Oh man. I'll look into it tonight
[10:11:52] <DaveMethvin> np ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)·Éö 
[10:11:56] <mikesherov> Safari 5.1.7 sucks for dimensions. 
[10:12:19] <DaveMethvin> if it wasn't for holidays i'd never get anything done
[10:23:25] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #505: STILL FAILING in 24 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/505/
[10:43:53] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: I'm actually going to drop "Mac OS X" in this particular case entirely. We don't care about the os for most desktop browsers, no reason to do so for Safari 6.0
[10:44:07] <snover> because it only runs on one os?
[10:44:09] <Krinkle> as a matter of fact, Safari 6.0 only has a Mac version (contrary to the earlier versions)
[10:44:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah, in this case we know where safari6 lives
[10:44:35] <Krinkle> I did it more to check if the mash up works with the icons
[10:44:44] <Krinkle> but we'll get to that in the mobile jobs
[10:44:44] <DaveMethvin> as a windows user, the fact there is no safari6 really sucks
[10:44:53] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Chromium or Chrome?
[10:45:12] <Krinkle> I personally prefer chrome over Safari, even more so as of 6.0
[10:45:15] <DaveMethvin> but it's not the SAME! :D
[10:45:22] <DaveMethvin> i use chrome all the tiem
[10:45:23] <DaveMethvin> time
[10:45:55] <Krinkle> they totally disfigured and destroyed any remote usefulness of the debug tools in 6.0
[10:46:13] <snover> except for the part where they work with ios
[10:46:15] <Krinkle> okay, maybe not that bad. But from a UI point of view I don't see any justification of the changes made. They aren't better in any way.
[10:46:20] <DaveMethvin> but to compensate, they added a shitload of strange bugs that people want jQuery to fix
[10:46:35] <snover> the justification is ‚Äúit looks more like xcode, the pinnacle of great ux‚Äù
[10:46:38] <Krinkle> snover: that's webkit, not safari. That's in chrome too, and has been in chrome before safari 6.0 had it.
[10:46:50] <Krinkle> Xcode is pretty good.
[10:46:51] <snover> Krinkle: uh
[10:47:08] <Krinkle> (the remote debugger stuff for ios)
[10:47:11] <snover> citation needed
[10:47:20] <snover> you are talking about iwebinspector?
[10:47:47] <Krinkle> I'm talking about the ability for the debug tools in Safari and Chrome to be accessible from an outgoing port
[10:48:13] <snover> because it would be really great to not have to use safari 6
[10:48:16] <snover> to debug ios
[10:48:20] <Krinkle> Which is a WebKit feature, not Safari. Which means Mobile Safari, Safari and Chrome all have it. And Chrome has it first, naturally, since they release much more often.
[10:48:38] <Krinkle> they had it last year.
[10:48:50] <Krinkle> it has only been usable now with ios, because it needs support from 2 sides.
[10:49:01] <Krinkle> and the latest iOS upgraded their webkit engine.
[10:49:31] <Krinkle> actually, the webkit engine of last years ios also supported it.
[10:49:41] <Krinkle> but they had no interface to enable it.
[10:50:14] <Krinkle> Adobe (and several others) made an app that just embedded the native safari with that option enabled.
[14:24:34] <Guest33906> Hello, may I ask a question about a comment in the jQuery source code?
[14:25:25] <Guest33906> Is someone here?
[14:27:11] <Guest33906> ?
[14:27:17] <rworth> Guest33906 no need to ask whether you can ask a question. Just ask it. Someone might have an answer right away. If they do, they'll speak up. Someone might have an answer hours from now. If no one has an answer they'll remain silent
[14:28:04] <Guest33906> Sorry, I didn't want to be rude.
[14:28:17] <Guest33906> What does this comment mean:    // Handle it asynchronously to allow scripts the opportunity to delay ready
[14:28:35] <Guest33906> it's written above: return setTimeout( jQuery.ready, 1 );
[14:28:58] <rworth> see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.holdReady/
[14:33:26] <Guest33906> Thanks! really interesting!
[15:19:49] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15Krinkle opened pull request #1039: ajax/script.js: Set async to true instead of "async" (prop vs. attar). (06master...06ajax-script)  02http://git.io/h71cKQ
[15:27:23] <ajpiano> lol "attar"
[15:28:14] <DaveMethvin> ATTAR!
[17:05:48] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: awesome triage as usual
[17:05:58] <mikesherov> I was getting agita looking at the new pile up
[17:06:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah it was a pretty productive day mikesherov
[17:06:16] <mikesherov> I live by your mantra

[18:49:55] <Krinkle> rwaldron: Ever since I saw this mailing list thread about an after party for LGBT a few months back (I hadn't heard of that abbreviation before), I read that when I see LGTM
[18:50:10] <Krinkle> it looks too similar
[18:50:21] <Krinkle> and every time I'm like. what? how is that relevant
[18:50:35] <Krinkle> But if you are a member of such group, you're still welcome :)
[18:51:25] <Krinkle> Thx for the merge.
