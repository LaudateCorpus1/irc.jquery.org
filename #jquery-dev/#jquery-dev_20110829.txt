[08:20:48] <jaubourg> hi there
[08:57:03] <jaubourg> meeting today?
[08:57:31] <JohnResig> yep
[09:12:11] <addyosmani> off-topic: who's the best person to speak to about access to the plugin site?
[09:12:15] <addyosmani> until we nuke it, there's some rather nasty spam that would be useful to remove (unless nuking is coming soon)
[09:12:18] <addyosmani> :)
[09:12:33] <ajpiano> addyosmani: i think pifantastic actually has admin creds for that
[09:12:56] <addyosmani> cool ajpiano. i shall speak to pifantastic then!
[09:46:20] <DaveMethvin> JohnResig: do  you have the nodejs version of mustache used in release-notes.js? Or is it just the std one from the mustache github?
[09:46:53] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: I just installed it from the npm repo
[09:47:16] <JohnResig> http://search.npmjs.org/#/mustache
[09:51:42] <DaveMethvin> ugh, node npm install mustache starts fine but on my windows setup here it isn't finding gzip on the path
[09:51:49] <DaveMethvin> gotta figure that out
[09:52:38] <DaveMethvin> we should steal this for jQuery tho: "Just tweeting a tiny part of the error will not be helpful>"
[10:53:11] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/bUND5w
[10:53:11] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Tagging the 1.6.3rc1 release. - Dave Methvin
[10:53:11] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Updating the source version to 1.6.3 - Dave Methvin
[10:53:11] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Merge branch 'master' of github.com:jquery/jquery - Dave Methvin
[10:53:37] <JohnResig> booya
[10:53:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah!
[10:53:54] <DaveMethvin> took a bit of work to get the scripts working right
[10:54:16] <DaveMethvin> i work on my own fork, i guess your "origin" is jquery/jquery JohnResig?
[10:54:49] <DaveMethvin> those scripts make it incredibly easy, almost scary easy!
[10:55:21] <JohnResig> yeah
[10:55:26] <JohnResig> haha :D
[10:55:47] <DaveMethvin> brb phone
[11:04:30] <timmywil> tweeted?
[11:11:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: git pull --rebase upstream master
[11:12:06] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: working on the blog right now
[11:12:33] <DaveMethvin> i missed jaubourg's fix to the test cases , that's why i had a pull after it
[11:12:57] <DaveMethvin> the scripts check for changes to origin but of course that's MY origin, not the jquery master
[11:13:18] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yea, the --rebase will place any local commits at the end
[11:13:28] <timmywil> and then no merge commit
[11:13:42] <timmywil> all good tho
[11:13:51] <DaveMethvin> i'd already committed it to my own branch so i was a little worried about doing that
[11:14:07] <DaveMethvin> since it's jsut a change to the test cases it dosen't affect the generated files anyway
[11:14:17] <timmywil> it's safe.  it will stop and allow you to resolve/abort if there are conflicts
[11:15:35] <timmywil> it's just a preference thing, i know.  jaubourg's commit is still in the tree before the tag
[11:17:10] <DaveMethvin> ok, blog post away!
[11:20:29] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: well done!
[11:20:40] <DaveMethvin> well ... done
[11:20:44] <DaveMethvin> :)
[11:21:05] <DaveMethvin> so who can tweet from the main jQuery acct?
[11:21:19] <DaveMethvin> I'll just do it from my acct for now
[11:21:30] <DaveMethvin> also added 1.6.3rc1 to versions in the bug tracker
[11:21:32] <timmywil> my argument for avoiding merge commits is that all that merge commit tells us is that the committer updated their origin, which is extraneous to those watching
[11:21:43] <DaveMethvin> good point
[11:22:25] <timmywil> ajpiano: tweetem some jQuery
[11:23:34] <DaveMethvin> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/08/29/jquery-1-6-3-rc1-released/
[11:25:35] <DaveMethvin> timmywil danheberden JohnResig do we normally put rc's on the download on the jQuery.com home page? I'm thinking no?
[11:26:09] <timmywil> don't think so
[11:26:15] <timmywil> but for final sure
[11:27:13] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: oh, no
[11:27:15] <JohnResig> that's true
[11:27:17] <timmywil> ajpiano is away. JohnResig, wanna tweet?
[11:27:22] <JohnResig> k
[11:28:46] <JohnResig> DaveMethvin: done

[11:51:58] <timmywil> just checkin somethin
[12:44:54] <matjas> jQuery 1.6.3rc1 gzip+min is only 16 bytes larger than jQuery 1.6.2 http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size
[12:53:38] <timmywil> cool
[13:06:46] <Insanity5902> anybody working on teh servers?
[13:09:12] <DaveMethvin> matjas I know we've let everyone down :)
[13:09:23] <DaveMethvin> of course we shrank the header a LOG
[13:09:26] <DaveMethvin> LOT*
[13:12:37] <Insanity5902> Looks like the blog.jquery.com server was rebooted
[13:12:43] <Insanity5902> and mysql didn't come back up
[13:13:11] <Insanity5902> started mysqld and the sites are back up
[13:33:53] <DaveMethvin> Insanity5902: thanks for taking care of that ... not sure why it was rebooted
[13:34:23] <Insanity5902> np, it was rebooted around 2:50 CDT
[13:34:37] <DaveMethvin> i just added the 1.6.3rc1 blog entry but that was just a wordpress thing and a couple of hours earlier
[13:34:53] <DaveMethvin> maybe someone thought the extra traffic was a sign of problems and did a preemptive reboot??
[14:08:47] <Insanity5902> DaveMethvin: not sure. I honestly didn't investigate much other then seeing mysql wasn't running. Saw it was shutdown cleanly , uptim was under 15 min. so I restarted mysql

[14:24:05] <rwaldron> :D
[14:24:29] <DaveMethvin> i dunno what some of these guys are thinking sometimes
[14:33:18] <rwaldron> they aren't
[14:33:30] <rwaldron> ok, i'm off
[14:33:31] <rwaldron> later
[22:10:49] <matjas> 1.6.3rc1 is fricken awesome
