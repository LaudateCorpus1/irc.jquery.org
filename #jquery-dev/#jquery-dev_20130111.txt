[05:21:49] <mikesherov> ajpiano: just saw the grunt dependency stuff
[05:22:08] <ajpiano> yeah
[05:22:16] <ajpiano> what a pain in the butter
[05:22:20] <mikesherov> glad we locked in some SHAs
[05:22:42] <mikesherov> I did that for grunt-update-submodules
[05:23:25] <mikesherov> so anyway, sorry I didn't respond earlier. If you need something today, lmk
[05:38:23] <ajpiano> no prob
[05:38:32] <ajpiano> will do
[05:38:43] <ajpiano> we'll have to figure out how to update the tasks for 0.4.0rc5 format
[07:05:41] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: thanks for fixing the build!
[07:05:59] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: :)
[07:06:05] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i also made this page for you http://stage.contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/
[07:06:20] <ajpiano> so all the pages that talk about how you should go about contributing things back to us that are in repos
[07:06:21] <ajpiano> can refer to that
[07:06:34] <ajpiano> feel free to go to town on that, add more, whatever
[07:06:36] <DaveMethvin> oh nice
[07:06:41] <ajpiano> i haven't slept
[07:06:42] <ajpiano> lol
[07:09:22] <ben_alman> ping ajpiano DaveMethvin 
[07:09:34] <ajpiano> hey ben_alman
[07:09:35] <DaveMethvin> present
[07:09:37] <ben_alman> so i actually want to try to figure out what exactly i screwed up
[07:09:46] <ben_alman> so maybe i can force-publish over the breaking change i made
[07:09:56] <ben_alman> because this is horrible
[07:10:00] <ajpiano> i didn't go too crazy ben_alman
[07:10:07] <ajpiano> i just set us onto 0.4.0rc4
[07:10:07] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15danilsomsikov opened pull request #1127: Rejecting nodes other than element and document in acceptData to avoid memory leak. Fixes #8335 (06master...06bug_8335)  02http://git.io/bGz6Yg
[07:10:14] <ben_alman> does 0.4.0rc4 work?
[07:10:20] <ben_alman> with all your plubins?
[07:10:24] <ben_alman> 0.4.0rc5 is the new one
[07:10:33] <ajpiano> and then i picked out the last commit on grunt-contrib-jshint and grunt-contrib-uglify
[07:10:36] <ben_alman> and only works iwth the plugins that have actually been updated for it, which is like 5 of them
[07:10:39] <ajpiano> from before you made the changes for #606
[07:10:43] <ben_alman> hmmn
[07:10:53] <ben_alman> so i published changes for 606 as non-rc5 releases?
[07:10:56] <ben_alman> shit
[07:10:58] <ben_alman> that would be tproblem.
[07:11:07] <ajpiano> https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-uglify/commits/master
[07:11:26] <ben_alman> ok so i need to revert some publishes
[07:12:27] <ben_alman> were these the only 2 plugins you noticed being screwed up?
[07:13:57] <ben_alman> ajpiano: were you isng grunt-contrib-uglify@0.1.0 ?
[07:14:24] <ben_alman> because that version still uses this.file.srcRaw
[07:15:01] <ajpiano> yes, it was using that before
[07:15:47] <ben_alman> link me your old pacakge.json again?
[07:15:55] <ben_alman> i want to try to see wtf is actually getting installed by it
[07:16:14] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/c1a59f78c26eed95f4ad5d69d00578e63754713d/package.json
[07:16:51] <ajpiano> ben_alman: the problem was that it was a catch 22
[07:17:04] <ben_alman> ok doing an npm install with that
[07:17:04] <ajpiano> with just "0.4.0", a fresh clone would get rc5
[07:17:11] <ajpiano> but we have custom multitasks
[07:17:17] <ajpiano> that aren't compatible with rc5
[07:17:19] <ben_alman> OH
[07:17:25] <ben_alman> hmmn
[07:17:41] <ben_alman> i didn't think npm would fetch a pre-release if you did ~0.4.0
[07:17:44] <ben_alman> that's INSANE
[07:18:00] <ajpiano> so i had to roll back to 0.4.0rc4 specifically, where i knew it worked, so i just went and grabbed the last versions of uglify and jshint that looked like they'd work with 0.4.0rc4
[07:18:03] <ajpiano> yeah i was surprised about that too
[07:18:07] <ben_alman> let me see what semver says
[07:18:34] <ben_alman> hmmn semver says pre-release needs a dash
[07:18:38] <ben_alman> 0.4.0-rc1
[07:18:47] <ben_alman> derp
[07:18:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah we break that rule too in core
[07:18:57] <ben_alman> well
[07:19:01] <DaveMethvin> i was just following precedent!
[07:19:06] <ben_alman> it does say  Identifiers MUST be comprised of only ASCII alphanumerics and dash [0-9A-Za-z-].
[07:19:18] <ben_alman> but also says A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a dash and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version.
[07:19:37] <DaveMethvin> the version of semver itself is v2.0.0-rc.1 that tells you something :D
[07:20:07] <ben_alman> i guess
[07:20:36] <ben_alman> https://github.com/isaacs/node-semver
[07:20:53] <ben_alman> it prefers no-tag to tag
[07:21:01] <ben_alman> but seems to require hyphen
[07:21:03] <ben_alman> stull
[07:21:10] <ben_alman> still yeah, noted.
[07:21:25] <ben_alman> people have to specify the pre-release version of grunt explicitly
[07:21:28] <ben_alman> and not use a ~
[07:21:40] <ben_alman> so does 0.4.0rc4 work just fine?
[07:22:32] <DaveMethvin> seemed to work for me last night
[07:22:50] <ben_alman> phew. ok.
[07:23:17] <DaveMethvin> the current package.json with rc4 and the two plugins nailed to sha's work
[07:24:14] <DaveMethvin> hmm, depending on how long this will be a problem i should update master (2.0) to fix this as well
[07:25:12] <ben_alman> so here's our schedule
[07:25:27] <ben_alman> i published rc5 along with like 6 plugins to npm as rc5-designated
[07:25:39] <ben_alman> tkellen is in charge of contrib and is afk until wednesday
[07:25:50] <ben_alman> which means the other plugins might not get pushed until then.
[07:26:05] <ben_alman> shama has put in a lot of effort updating them all, but they have to be reviewed and published
[07:26:08] <ajpiano> what we should do is figure out how to get our multi tasks to run on rc5
[07:26:15] <ajpiano> and get that in a branch
[07:26:27] <ajpiano> and then have it ready to go when all the rc5 and contrib is out
[07:26:31] <ben_alman> any changes that happen at this point will be very minor
[07:26:31] <ajpiano> and we should roll with this for a few days
[07:26:36] <ben_alman> i might not even make them until 0.4.1 tbh
[07:26:44] <ajpiano> right
[07:26:48] <ben_alman> nothink like what happened with rc5
[07:26:51] <ben_alman> nothing
[07:27:11] <DaveMethvin> i've updated to grunt 0.4 in jquery-migrate too but now i have the decoder ring to fix it
[07:27:12] <ben_alman> see https://gist.github.com/4506644
[07:27:49] <DaveMethvin> since 1.9 final, 2.0 beta, and migrate final are all shipping early next week i'd rather just come up with something stable now
[07:27:55] <DaveMethvin> we can fix this later
[07:28:47] <ben_alman> in grunt 0.5, plugin authors won't be pulling apis off of grunt, they'll be requiring them
[07:28:56] <ben_alman> so when grunt changes, they won't have to update
[07:29:07] <ben_alman> grunt will just be the task runner system
[07:29:27] <ben_alman> not sure how it's all going tow ork, but we'll figure it out
[07:38:55] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[07:38:56] <doesallmagic> Project QUnit build #245: FIXED in 18 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/245/
[07:38:56] <doesallmagic> joern.zaefferer: Upgrade to latest node-testswarm, take out logs test again, since that timed out on TestSwarm so far.
[08:21:04] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin, ajpiano i just wrote this guide on installing grunt, can you tell me if it would have solved the problem you guys are having? https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/wiki/Advanced-usage
[08:22:33] <ajpiano> i've never used --save-dev
[08:22:37] <ajpiano> and i'm not usre why i'd start
[08:22:48] <ben_alman> it auto adds it to devDependencies
[08:22:55] <ben_alman> relatively new feature
[08:23:01] <ben_alman> few months maybe
[08:24:20] <DaveMethvin> i'm not up to speed on the install process, basically a PR arrived on my doorstep from mikesherov and I learned enough to feel like i knew what it was doing
[08:25:00] <ben_alman> well, ultimately, who is responsible for this
[08:25:08] <ben_alman> it would be great to get their feedback
[08:25:11] <DaveMethvin> the basic problem is that we're using a dev version of something, which is unstable from release to release even if the version doesn't change
[08:25:22] <DaveMethvin> in retrospect we shouldn't  have done that
[08:25:26] <ben_alman> but if you lock in a version it's no problem, right?
[08:25:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah and that was another problem we had
[08:25:49] <DaveMethvin> >= in dependencies
[08:25:55] <ben_alman> ya
[08:26:02] <ben_alman> for releases, ~ is great
[08:26:04] <DaveMethvin> i am not even a fan of ~ tbh
[08:26:10] <ben_alman> sure
[08:26:18] <DaveMethvin> i want to know that what i build is what you build
[08:26:26] <ben_alman> sure
[08:26:55] <DaveMethvin> so yeah if we specified one true version it should prevent this
[08:26:59] <ben_alman> yep
[08:27:21] <ben_alman> what i tried to say in that wiki page
[08:27:37] <ben_alman> is that for dev versions, please don't ever use a tilde
[08:28:20] <DaveMethvin> i'm afraid this is like telling a kid not to touch the stove
[08:28:30] <ben_alman> no i don't care
[08:28:45] <ben_alman> due dilligence is all i'm going for
[08:28:57] <DaveMethvin> plausible deniability :D
[08:29:01] <DaveMethvin> i think you got there
[08:29:13] <DaveMethvin> it's mainly that this dependency crap is incredibly complicated
[08:29:28] <DaveMethvin> but that's not grunt's fault per se

[08:41:21] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: I think the instructions for "Installing a published development version of grunt" should advise people to use a non-~ approach
[08:41:37] <ben_alman> didn't i do that?
[08:41:48] <ben_alman> like a whole thing in italics?
[08:42:07] <DaveMethvin> oh sorry, i meant the section above
[08:42:15] <DaveMethvin> there's some duplication there
[08:42:39] <DaveMethvin> Installing a specific version of grunt
[08:42:48] <DaveMethvin> to me a specific version is, well, a SPECIFIC version
[08:43:17] <ben_alman> hmmn
[08:43:41] <ben_alman> well grunt uses ~ versions internally
[08:43:53] <ben_alman> you can use npm shrinkwrap if you care about exact versions
[08:43:58] <DaveMethvin> sorry, gotta go ... don't sweat this now it's more of a philosophical thing

[12:48:59] <therealklanni> Does jQuery 1.8 still only use "success", "error" and "complete" for the _property name_ in the options object of an $.ajax object? I know the fluent interface is being deprecated in favor of "done"/"fail"/"always" but is that naming convention carrying over to the options object as well?
[12:54:09] <therealklanni> I'm asking because I'm writing a prefilter that needs to modify the callbacks and set up a new deferred. I'm not sure if I should plan on there being a "done" property in the options object (for instance)
