[08:12:27] <danheberden> gnarf: yo
[08:12:37] <gnarf> danheberden: you know anything about feedburner?
[08:12:53] <gnarf> or rather the jquery feedburner account?
[08:13:11] <danheberden> um, it was probably before my time
[08:13:19] <danheberden> do you need credentials for it or something?
[08:13:40] <gnarf> i don't know why its broken
[08:28:41] <gnarf> i think logging in to check the url would help
[08:47:40] <danheberden> gnarf, the password manager doesn't work on osx mountain lion
[08:47:42] <danheberden> ugh
[08:47:55] <gnarf> danheberden: i didn't see anything in there
[08:47:58] <gnarf> searched for "feed"
[08:48:00] <gnarf> got nothin
[08:48:03] <danheberden> in keepass?
[08:48:07] <gnarf> yeah
[08:48:09] <danheberden> oh
[08:48:10] <danheberden> well then
[08:48:16] <danheberden> i have no ideas
[08:48:32] <danheberden> someone has to know
[11:18:19] <coopersemantics> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/924
[11:19:06] <mikesherov> coopersemantics is another SNAPPer
[11:19:35] <mikesherov> ajpiano: now that rwaldron is in NY, we should all meetup
[11:19:45] <paul_irish> whats a SNAPPer
[11:19:49] <mikesherov> LOL
[11:20:04] <mikesherov> One of my coworkers at SNAP Interactive in NYC
[11:20:08] <paul_irish> oh
[11:20:12] <paul_irish> i though it stood for something
[11:20:13] <paul_irish> like
[11:20:14] <mikesherov> LOL
[11:20:30] <mikesherov> Social Networking Application Provider, or other such jargon
[11:20:50] <paul_irish> Spontaneously Notification Action Per Pullrequest
[11:20:56] <mikesherov> HAHA
[11:21:03] <paul_irish> aka
[11:21:03] <mikesherov> I suppose that works too
[11:21:12] <paul_irish> " I MADE A PULL REQUEST GUYS "
[11:21:14] <mikesherov> I will post on the ticket and in IRC immediately
[11:21:24] <paul_irish> feels like we should have an acrynom for that
[11:21:27] <paul_irish> ya
[11:21:30] <paul_irish> feels good
[11:21:37] <paul_irish> lol acrynom
[11:21:39] <mikesherov> Well, let's call it a SNAPPer
[11:21:57] <paul_irish> oh yeah coopersemantics with the unit test.
[11:21:58] <paul_irish> baller
[11:22:18] <paul_irish> hm
[11:22:28] <paul_irish> the manip commands are supposed to work on XML?
[11:22:34] <mikesherov> apparently
[11:22:38] <paul_irish> :'(
[11:23:25] <mikesherov> I personally feel it's a bit of a reach, but they do work, so...
[11:23:41] <mikesherov> I know in 3 months there'll be some other bug with it
[11:23:47] <mikesherov> and I'll want to kill myself
[11:24:57] <paul_irish> well
[11:25:03] <paul_irish> there should be a policy call on it.
[11:25:13] <paul_irish> like there kind of was with SVG
[11:25:21] <paul_irish> in that SVG isnt supported.
[11:25:58] <mikesherov> Sure
[11:26:07] <mikesherov> but I think $.parseXML seals the deal there
[11:26:16] <mikesherov> and DaveMethvin seemed pretty gung ho on the patch
[11:26:29] <mikesherov> but yeah, I agree it's one of the things that might toe the line
[11:27:09] <mikesherov> although…. http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix#SVG.2FXML.2FVML_Bugs
[11:27:15] <mikesherov> NOOOOOOOOO
[11:28:02] <mikesherov> "Won't Fix" always seemed like a guideline as opposed to a hard and fast rule. If the patch is simple enough, maybe it's worth it.
[11:53:07] <ajpiano> bot-t: tell mikesherov yea dude!!!
[11:53:08] <bot-t> ajpiano, Okay.
[12:03:47] <rwaldron> The problem with making "simple enough, maybe it's worth it" decisions is that they rarely take into consideration the support that comes with it
[12:04:03] <rwaldron> I'll repeat that, for mikesherov
[12:04:05] <rwaldron> The problem with making "simple enough, maybe it's worth it" decisions is that they rarely take into consideration the support that comes with it
[12:04:12] <mikesherov> yes
[12:04:13] <bot-t> (11 mins 5 secs ago) <ajpiano> tell mikesherov yea dude!!!
[12:04:21] <mikesherov> rwaldron:
[12:04:22] <mikesherov> mikesherov: I personally feel it's a bit of a reach, but they do work, so...
[12:04:28] <mikesherov> mikesherov: I know in 3 months there'll be some other bug with it
[12:04:34] <mikesherov> mikesherov: and I'll want to kill myself
[12:04:50] <rwaldron> yes
[12:04:57] <mikesherov> We can close wontfix, I don't mind
[12:05:04] <rwaldron> I will stop you from killing yourself
[12:05:08] <mikesherov> The pull request was good practice for coopersemantics
[12:05:19] <mikesherov> so if it's wontfix, it's wontfix
[12:05:27] <mikesherov> I just want the bug closed
[12:06:15] <rwaldron> scxml seems like a nightmare
[12:09:57] <rwaldron> mikesherov, I'm leaning towards "this is ok"
[12:10:16] <rwaldron> We always have the "Won't Fix" if the bugs in 6 months are absurd
[12:10:34] <mikesherov> yup
[12:10:47] <rwaldron> this at least gets a small piece of code in, for a reasonable pay off
[12:10:56] <rwaldron> I made some comments in the test
[12:11:09] <mikesherov> cool… cooopersemantics: you have some comments
[12:11:21] <mikesherov> coopersemantics ^
[12:11:32] <rwaldron> oh, didn't realize the author with present
[12:11:39] <rwaldron> howdy coopersemantics
[12:11:52] <paul_irish> coopersemantics coopersemantics coopersemantics coopersemantics coopersemantics
[12:11:53] <rwaldron> unrelated...
[12:12:32] <ajpiano> mikesherov: you sure are getting a lot of snappers to bite the jquery bug :D
[12:12:39] <ajpiano> i should say, infecting them with :)
[12:12:41] <mikesherov> trying
[12:13:01] <mikesherov> heck, if bocoup could do it...
[12:13:46] <paul_irish> nice work mikesherov
[12:13:48] <rwaldron> why does everyone think jQuery has anything to do with FF and XPConnect/Xul?
[12:13:54] <paul_irish> wat
[12:13:55] <b-ot> if i save vars in a click event and trigger a change event in the click event, can i commit this vars in the change event?
[12:14:08] <rwaldron> or that XPConnect/Xul is even representative of "the actual effing web"
[12:14:35] <mikesherov> thanks paul_irish it's important to have commitment from companies large and small to open source
[12:14:36] <rwaldron> paul_irish http://forum.jquery.com/topic/exposed-props#14737000003582815
[12:14:47] <mikesherov> we use jquery constantly, so, we gotta give back
[12:15:19] <ajpiano> mikesherov: yeah, it's rad
[12:15:33] <mikesherov> we have monthly hackathons, and I always do "open source code raid" on one of the projects we use
[12:15:35] <ajpiano> looking forward to meeting folks in dc....
[12:15:37] <ajpiano> or nyc, lol
[12:15:43] <mikesherov> well, at both
[12:15:56] <rwaldron> i've seen a square of light cross over the floor 7-8 times out the corner of my eye
[12:15:56] <mikesherov> I was telling rwaldron that we gotta meet up when he comes into the city
[12:16:04] <rwaldron> and I was getting freaked out
[12:16:41] <ajpiano> confirm
[12:16:42] <rwaldron> walked over to the place where it was and realized the fan in the loft was reflecting light when it oscillated.
[12:17:02] <rwaldron> for about 30 seconds I was terrified.
[12:17:09] <rwaldron> former linen factory?
[12:17:11] <rwaldron> GHOSTS.
[12:18:49] <rwaldron> Also, our loft has a distinct "tree house" feel to it
[13:07:31] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a way to get the full contents of a window?
[13:07:44] <scott_gonzalez> Basically document.innerHTML
[13:12:59] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: document.documentElement.innerHTML gives you everything but the <html> and the doctype
[13:14:20] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Yeah, I think I might have to use that and just tack on the doctype and html tags.
[13:14:30] <ajpiano> ah ok
[13:14:42] <ajpiano> html5ify everythign
[13:21:00] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: We've done all of our major updates for the API sites. Let me know if you have any thoughts on things that should change for http://api.qunitjs.com
[13:21:11] <scott_gonzalez> Now that we're off of the legacy branch, we can also deploy at any point.
[13:47:30] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez interesting... the main page example is gone
[13:48:27] <rwaldron> nevermind
[13:48:35] <rwaldron> thats on qunitjs.com
[15:52:06] <johnbender> ryanneuf_: you there?
[15:53:57] <ryanneuf_> I am
[15:54:01] <ryanneuf_> wassup
[15:54:24] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: hola amigo
[16:04:13] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: does setting an ip in a bridged network make sense? Doesn't the guest just assume the ip of the host?
[16:04:30] <ryanneufeld> no, it would DHCP
[16:04:41] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I'm asking because I'm ignorant
[16:05:19] <ryanneufeld> the current docs sate that it would DHCP automagically, and you'd have to ssh in to the hostonly ip and run ifconfig
[16:06:03] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: where in our dev environment it makes sense to have the IP set via a config, similar to how jquery's infra works
[16:06:31] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: ah
[16:06:34] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: plugins man
[16:06:35] <ryanneufeld> as we have an internal DNS, it would be handy to have the IPS set that way.
[16:06:47] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I might just use puppet to provision it
[16:06:48] <ryanneufeld> :P
[16:09:14] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: needs moar docs
