[12:58:18] <markelog_> random testing - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_testing
[12:58:44] <markelog_> not crazy, but clever! :)
[13:05:43] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15markelog closed issue #2824: 1.12.0 vs 1.11.2 selectors with # broken 02https://git.io/vwmlw
[13:59:26] <gibson042> markelog: those aren't exactly analogous to what we're talking about, though... "if an exception arises during test execution then it means there is a fault in the program" doesn't hold for us
[14:02:56] <markelog> gibson042: it is not literal in the sense, exceptions is just a flag, like golang, for example doesn't have exception, but it doesn't mean such testing approach doesn't apply for this language
[14:03:26] <gibson042> it's not that such a strategy is inapplicable for the language, but for jQuery as a library
[14:03:45] <gibson042> we explicitly permit exceptions
[14:04:10] <markelog> again, exceptions are just a flag, which says that test fails 
[14:04:19] <markelog> that flag could be anything
[14:04:23] <gibson042> such as?
[14:04:41] <gibson042> fuzz testing explores invalid input, for which we leave behavior unspecified
[14:04:53] <markelog> like throwing an exception could be considered as correct result 
[14:04:57] <markelog> or specific return value
[14:04:57] <gibson042> so literally any result is a non-failure
[14:05:28] <markelog> yes, but we discuss to change, and dave and timmy said we couldn't do that, without testing all possible values
[14:05:39] <markelog> since it would be "crazy"
[14:05:46] <gibson042> ah, ok
[14:05:54] <gibson042> yes, then in that sense I agree with you
[14:06:07] <DaveMethvin> fuzz testing mainly helps find security issues
[14:06:14] <markelog> testing world is a deep one :)
[14:06:25] <markelog> depends what kind of program you writing 
[14:06:30] <gibson042> fuzz testing is precisely the approach by which you get good coverage over all possible inputs, without actually testing every single one
[14:07:15] <gibson042> incidentally, http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/ and https://hypothesis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ make for great reading if you're interested in the space
[14:09:14] <markelog> yeah, i saw something like this for js too
[14:10:08] <markelog> it is pretty cool approach if you dig that kind of staff
