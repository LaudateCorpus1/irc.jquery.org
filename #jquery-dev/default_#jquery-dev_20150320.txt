[07:09:36] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol closed issue #2150: jQuery 2.x (3.0) still support IE 6, 7 and 8 02http://git.io/hafw
[07:16:06] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: I don't know about any, otherwise we wouldn't write our own. ;) I hope for more ES6-module-based tooling, though
[07:18:15] <JamesMGreene> Yeah m_gol, more ES6 modules would be nice 
[07:18:36] <JamesMGreene> Is amdClean insufficient for jQuery core's needs (while using AMD rather than ES6 modules)?
[07:18:54] <JamesMGreene> I haven't delved into either too deeply
[07:19:17] <m_gol> idk honestly, timmywil wrote most of that code afaik
[07:23:25] <timmywil> yes, it's insufficient. Our build system reduces the impact on size to zero.
[07:23:34] <timmywil> it's similar tho
[07:23:44] <JamesMGreene> k
[07:23:48] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol opened issue #2152: Run the Promises/A+ test suite in real browsers 02http://git.io/hwjp
[07:24:13] <JamesMGreene> Any more specific differences you know of offhand and/or have documented? If not, don't waste any time on it for my sake :)
[07:26:29] <timmywil> one difference is our var modules, which are transpiled directly to var declartions with no closures
[07:29:03] <timmywil> we can be a bit more aggressive because we don't have to guarantee it works for other projects
[07:30:52] <JamesMGreene> sure
[07:30:54] <JamesMGreene> cool, thanks

[20:55:40] <mavihs> hi :)
[20:56:10] <mavihs> jzaefferer: Thanks for your comments on my proposal. I'll update it soon :)
