[01:58:46] <jzaefferer> fcarstens: nice; can you (try to) include Intern there as well? 
[01:59:48] <fcarstens> you mean the very slightly complicated framework? ;-) 
[01:59:57] <fcarstens> I'll try :-)
[02:01:04] <jzaefferer> you can bug snover here or in #intern (when he's around) with Intern specific questions
[02:01:19] <jzaefferer> the docs are rather light on the custom reporter API
[02:02:17] <jzaefferer> adding intern would get us to the list of frameworks we were looking at before, e.g. https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/1#issuecomment-54572441

[10:12:26] <Krinkle> Hm.. so I keep running into this every other month when a remote server somewhere I use in experimental dashboards of mine isn't up - there is no error event or timeout on $.ajax() for <script>
[10:12:48] <Krinkle> if the request times out forever, or if it goes straight to HTTP 503 - the promise stays unresolved and pending 
[10:14:13] <m_gol> Krinkle: is this reproducible with every 503?
[10:14:31] <Krinkle> s = document.createElement('script');
[10:14:34] <Krinkle> s.src = 'http://anot.jquery.com/fo'
[10:14:38] <Krinkle> s.onload = s.onreadystatechange = function () { console.log(this, arguments); }
[10:14:42] <Krinkle> document.head.insertBefore(s, document.head.firstChild)
[10:14:44] <Krinkle> never called
[10:14:48] <Krinkle> eventhough it immediately fails
[10:15:06] <Krinkle> but shouldn't at least options.timeout kick in at some point?
[10:15:26] <m_gol> does it work with jQuery 2.1.3?
[10:15:43] <Krinkle> i = $.ajax({ url: 'http://anot.jquery.com/fo', dataType: 'script', cache: true, timeout: 9000 /*ms*/ })
[10:18:34] <m_gol> Krinkle: works for me both on master & compat
[10:18:42] <Krinkle> Hm..
[10:18:50] <m_gol> i.then(function () { console.log('1', arguments); }, function () { console.log('2', arguments); });
[10:18:53] <m_gol> logs 2 & arguments
[10:20:03] <Krinkle> Yeah, me too. after 9 seconds with jQuery 1.x
[10:20:06] <Krinkle> Interesting
[10:20:30] <Krinkle> trying to make a repro of the error I had
[10:20:34] <Krinkle> where it doesn't time out 
[10:21:16] <m_gol> on jQuery master the failure is immediate, on compat it's after a delay (tested in Chrome)
[10:21:35] <m_gol> the whole xhr was re-implemented in jQ 2 with onload/onerror etc., jQ 1 uses onreadystatechange
[10:22:02] <Krinkle> Yep
[10:22:24] <Krinkle> So without timeout: added to $.ajax, in jQuery 1 request will never resolve
[10:22:28] <m_gol> right
[10:22:34] <m_gol> can you report an issue?
[10:23:20] <Krinkle> There's an NFS outage at Wikimedia in one of the Labs services which a lot of power users depend on to host their scripts and gadgets. Since those requests either time out or yield 503, this is common.
[10:23:40] <Krinkle> most people don't specify timeout and I was noticing that unless I disable all gadgets I had enabled, the page would never load or give any error
[10:23:41] <Krinkle> just stay blank
[10:23:43] <Krinkle> :D
[10:23:59] <m_gol> haha
[10:24:14] <Krinkle> eventhough I see the error *immediately* in the Chrome console
[10:24:35] <m_gol> a browser extension that swaps jQuery 1 for an API-eqivalent jQuery 2 version? ;p
[10:24:58] <m_gol> it might be tricky on compat if onreadystatechange doesn't give enough useful information
[10:25:10] <m_gol> adding support for onerror wouldn't work in IE8
[10:25:25] <Krinkle> m_gol: Would it be acceptable to add it as an improvement?
[10:25:29] <Krinkle> For where it does work?
[10:25:39] <Krinkle> For compliance with jQuery 2
[10:25:42] <m_gol> maybe, this seems quite bad when it breaks
