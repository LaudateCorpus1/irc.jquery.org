[07:02:39] <scott_gonzalez> Still a work in progress.
[07:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> But you can get an idea for how it works.
[07:06:22] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: ^
[07:07:23] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: it seems I'm not part of the right group to see that
[07:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Try now.
[07:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> I just added you to the release team.
[07:08:55] <timmywil> cool, thanks. I can see it now
[07:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'd just like to get confirmation from everyone that this is a good path to follow and then we can make this public.
[07:12:18] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: nice work. this will be awesome if we can get it working for everyone.
[07:12:43] <timmywil> s/if/when
[07:13:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, shouldn't be too hard to do.
[07:13:22] <scott_gonzalez> Since core uses Trac, most of this should work already.
[07:13:29] <scott_gonzalez> I still need to write the GitHub integration for Mobile.
[07:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> But I can mostly just copy that from their existing script.
[07:13:58] <scott_gonzalez> I don't expect core to use this for the upcoming release.
[07:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> But we should be able to transition to it for the next one.
[07:14:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm hoping to use this for the UI 1.11 release.
[07:56:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: once the GitHub integration is done, I need to try this on the QUnit repo.
