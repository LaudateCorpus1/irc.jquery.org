[04:45:08] <m_gol> leobalter: congrats! :)
[04:45:53] <m_gol> leobalter: do you still need to run tests on IE6 in BrowserStack automatically, even from time to time? I'd like to tell them they can retire a special machine kept just for us as soon as we don't need it as I'm sure it's a real cost to them
[04:46:20] <m_gol> markelog: ping
[04:46:26] <markelog> pong

[06:43:35] <m_gol> markelog: when do you want to remove IE6/Yandex from various places? Since we've released 3.0.0 I'd like to write to BrowserStack soon about us no longer needing the constantly-running IE6 machine but we need to get rid of all that first
[06:43:47] <m_gol> I think I'd like to do all that next week
[06:44:21] <markelog> you already removed it from swarm for weekly, right?
[06:44:30] <markelog> i removed it from sizzle
[06:44:51] <markelog> letter to bb sounds good, if we are only one who is using it
[06:45:01] <markelog> we probably are

[09:46:04] <m_gol> markelog: I haven't removed it from anywhere. And it's not removed from Sizzle: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/603f51b8a15c8d64570c73c59c0c30c6d9de76fe/Gruntfile.js#L59
[09:47:03] <markelog> i don't see it on http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jqueryweekly
[09:47:16] <m_gol> it's in the regular runs, not weekly ones
[09:47:40] <m_gol> I see you only removed Yandex from Sizzle, not IE 6. :)
[09:47:42] <markelog> i don't see it there too - http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[09:47:53] <markelog> oh, man, i meant yandex.browser
[09:47:56] <markelog> not ie6
[09:47:58] <m_gol> haha
[09:48:06] <markelog> :)
[09:48:20] <m_gol> I can remove IE 6 & write to BrowserStack then
[09:48:30] <m_gol> I'll just make sure QUnit doesn't need it first
[09:48:39] <markelog> i think we can ask them to remove yandex.browser too
[09:48:43] <m_gol> no other project of ours supports IE 6, UI has dropped it ages ago
[09:48:46] <m_gol> sure, that makes sense
[09:48:51] <m_gol> I'll write that in one mail
[09:48:58] <markelog> sounds good
[09:49:04] <m_gol> k, thx
[09:49:16] <markelog> would you mind cc me in that letter?
[09:49:41] <m_gol> sure
[09:50:03] <m_gol> I mean, I wouldn't mind :-)
[09:54:59] <leobalter> m_gol: it's been a good while since the last release of QUnit 1.x and the last QUnit 2-rc (in April)
[09:55:24] <m_gol> leobalter: do you plan no further 1.x releases?
[09:55:29] <leobalter> nope
[09:55:44] <m_gol> ok, great, I'll notify BrowserStack next week then :)
[09:56:13] <leobalter> It would be super especific if someone reports a IE6 bug on QUnit 1.x from now on
[10:09:25] <m_gol> leobalter: what does "especific" mean?
[10:25:45] <leobalter> m_gol: I would not expect any bug report for IE6 from now on. 
[10:26:40] <leobalter> it's not worth to hold a browserstack server for it
[10:57:39] <m_gol> ok, thanks
