[10:55:29] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15jakob-stoeck opened pull request #1447: use innerHTML for numbers additionally to strings with .html() (06master...06master) 02http://git.io/5j9jIg
[10:57:32] <DaveMethvin> Yeah, use .html() instead of .text() when setting something you know to be a number. Right.
