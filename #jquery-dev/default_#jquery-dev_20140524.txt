[05:06:43] <scott_gonzalez> leobalter: Sounds promising :-)
[07:30:17] <leobalter> scott_gonzalez: I need some help there, even if I can detect the selected methods, I'm doing something noob by not knowing how to change the node.   
[11:13:52] <leobalter> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer : great news, it's working now! https://github.com/leobalter/rocambole-method-rename
[12:11:08] <leobalter> scott_gonzalez I'm using nodeunit because of the quick integration. I'm just waiting for https://github.com/JamesMGreene/grunt-qunitnode #5 and #6 to land to change it
[12:13:23] <leobalter> the next step is to make it helper function to save in dest file, and start updating some jQuery projects, carefully, of course. :) 
[12:14:01] <leobalter> anyway, thank you! It was an amazing challenge to write that module.
[17:38:50] <sotarules> Hey friends, anyone out there?
[17:40:10] <sotarules> I have a question about a pull request for JQuery Sortable and Travis CI--for some reason the automated tests failed with npm install step, it looks like it never ran any tests.
[17:42:24] <sotarules> This is JQuery UI pull request #1253.  It also looks like the build prior to mine failed in the same way.
[17:42:48] <sotarules> So the question is when Travis CI build fails in this manner, what is the process to get that fixed?
