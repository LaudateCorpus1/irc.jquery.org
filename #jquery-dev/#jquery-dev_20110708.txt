[03:15:46] <Patabugen> Hey All, I'm writing a plugin. The basic plugin I'm OK with, but if I want to split my code and have other functions, where's the best place to put them?
[03:16:02] <Patabugen> I gathered its' good practice to only have one $.fn. level function
[03:16:32] <Patabugen> Ah! Nevermind, I found the docs on the website :)
[05:27:10] <vhsjon> hi guys
[05:28:30] <vhsjon> I am building up a form dynamically using jQuery, but when Im submitting the form, the jQuery.validate validation does not work. Ive checked out jQuery.live, but I don't think this is what I need. Does anybody have a tip on how to use jQuery.validate to validate dynamically built forms?
[05:29:34] <scott_gonzalez_> vhsjon: ask support questions in #jquery, this channel is specifically for development of jQuery core
[05:29:55] <vhsjon> ah, ok, I just saw that in the topic, I was a little bit too fast, sorry!
[07:33:42] <sean`> anyone aware that the download button jquery.com doesnj't force a download?
[07:40:43] <Jon47> sean` i think that's by design?
[07:41:14] <sean`> could be, just pointing it out to be sure
[08:19:00] <rwaldron> sean` it has always just linked to the raw source
[08:19:49] <rwaldron> and intentionally does not force a download... so that people can link to it if they'd like
[08:20:01] <rwaldron> (link to it in their source that is)
[08:25:31] <sean`> hmpf
[08:25:32] <sean`> WEIRD
[08:25:35] <sean`> I always downloaded it :p

[08:39:46] <timmywil> lol, more like 250mps but ya
[08:43:49] <timmywil> that was awesome, ok back to work
[09:02:15] <azatoth_work> what is the probabillity of lurkabillity for the form wizard dude herearound?
[11:19:45] <kswedberg> timmywil: yt?
[11:19:53] <timmywil> kswedberg: yo
[11:20:07] <kswedberg> Hey man. Is this still true for .prop()? "The code if ( $(elem).attr("checked") ), on the other hand, will retrieve the attribute, which does not change as the checkbox is checked and unchecked. It is meant only to store the default or initial value of the checked property."
[11:20:27] <timmywil> kswedberg: ah, no that's only true in 1.6
[11:20:44] <kswedberg> k. wanna update the doc? or you want me to do that?
[11:21:01] <timmywil> I can do it if you'd like me to
[11:21:06] <kswedberg> I'd love it. :)
[11:21:08] <kswedberg> thx!
[11:21:14] <timmywil> kk, np
[11:53:22] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[11:53:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah, just a couple minutes
[11:53:49] <rwaldron> ok
[11:53:54] <rwaldron> ping me when you can chat
[11:53:59] <timmywil> kswedberg: how's this? http://api.jquery.com/prop/?preview=true&preview_id=4144&preview_nonce=bb43315bfa
[11:54:04] <timmywil> can you see that?
[11:54:23] <timmywil> or should I just focus on the latest jQuery
[11:59:34] <kswedberg> I think it looks good. Not sure if I'm seeing the right version
[12:00:02] <kswedberg> "Most often, <code>.prop()</code> should be used to set disabled and checked instead of" … maybe change "Most often" to "Typically"?
[12:00:36] <timmywil> kswedberg: oh I didn't edit that section
[12:00:50] <kswedberg> heh. ok.
[12:01:30] <kswedberg> timmywil: ah. I'm seeing the "autosave" now.
[12:01:42] <timmywil> ah ok cool
[12:03:45] <kswedberg> The changes look great!
[12:04:19] <timmywil> kswedberg: cool thx!
[12:04:33] <kswedberg> The only one I'd change back is "true if the attribute is present at all—even if,…"
[12:04:56] <kswedberg> Looks like you changed em-dash to en-dash or hyphen or something.
[12:04:56] <timmywil> kswedberg: that hyphen?
[12:05:07] <kswedberg> timmywil: yeah, it should be an em-dash;
[12:05:11] <kswedberg> —
[12:05:21] <timmywil> does it output that? cause I thought IE couldn't read those
[12:05:28] <kswedberg> sure it can.
[12:05:43] <timmywil> hm, ok then
[12:06:25] <kswedberg> &mdash; , &#8212;, —. no problems.
[12:06:37] <kswedberg> timmywil: except don't use &mdash; in XML.
[12:06:58] <timmywil> emacs barks at me cause it's not unicode or something
[12:07:22] <timmywil> (I copy and paste to edit)
[12:07:29] <timmywil> easier to read
[12:07:41] <timmywil> but I can leave those
[12:08:00] <kswedberg> (yeah, me too)
[12:08:15] <kswedberg> &#8212; should work too. it is unicode
[12:08:40] <timmywil> yea i'll do that one in sites
[12:09:04] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[12:09:05] <timmywil> if I can remember the code heh
[12:10:23] <kswedberg> timmywil: cool. :) btw, WP has a new fullscreen button in the Edit Post screen for quick edits. it's not too bad. http://swedberg.us/grab/wp-fullscreen-20110708-151011.png
[12:10:47] <timmywil> kswedberg: oh nice
[12:11:41] <kswedberg> yeah, not bad. no syntax highlighting, of course. but much better than the little textarea.
[12:25:16] <timmywil> kswedberg: updated
[12:25:31] <kswedberg> timmywil: rockstar!
[12:26:39] <timmywil> kswedberg: feel free to tweak.  I won't be offended. :)
[12:26:46] <kswedberg> k

[13:19:26] <DaveMethvin> wish timmywil was coming up
[13:19:32] <timmywil> me too!
[13:54:39] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin sorry i missed you
[13:54:41] <rwaldron> are you still there?
[13:54:58] <DaveMethvin> yep ... so you didn't miss me?
[13:55:06] <rwaldron> i do miss yo
[13:55:07] <rwaldron> you*
[13:55:10] <DaveMethvin> awwww
[13:55:17] <DaveMethvin> sup
[13:55:26] <rwaldron> well, i cant remember the ticket number
[13:55:30] <rwaldron> so i'm looking that up
[13:56:07] <rwaldron> ?9779
[13:56:08] <bot-t> [#9779]  (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/9779
[13:56:13] <rwaldron> docs#9779
[13:56:14] <bot-t> [#9779]  (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/9779
[13:56:16] <rwaldron> duh
[13:56:20] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9779
[13:56:22] <rwaldron> anyway
[13:56:39] <rwaldron> I was confused about your wording
[13:56:42] <DaveMethvin> i dunno if there's anything to do there
[13:56:54] <rwaldron> mostly, I just wanted you to know that I was on the same page as you
[13:56:54] <DaveMethvin> we can either document how the method fires or stop it from firing
[13:57:03] <rwaldron> just seemed like you thought I was arguing or something
[13:57:11] <DaveMethvin> me? argue with you?
[13:57:13] <rwaldron> "@rwaldron, right but we do support bind/trigger on plain JS objects."
[13:57:23] <rwaldron> i was confused
[13:57:28] <rwaldron> because thats what my fiddle was doing
[13:57:33] <rwaldron> thats what i was showing the dude
[13:57:42] <DaveMethvin> well just that unfortunately the method is called as a side effect
[13:57:47] <rwaldron> right
[13:58:06] <rwaldron> i was just trying to explain to them that they could totally bind events to plain objects
[13:58:12] <rwaldron> which you were also doing
[13:58:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah and i'd prefer he did it that way
[13:58:30] <rwaldron> anyway, seems like we're in agreement and i was just misunderstood
[13:58:33] <rwaldron> me too
[13:58:34] <DaveMethvin> that's why i asked if he *had* to name the event and the method the same
[13:58:56] <DaveMethvin> b/c it only happens when you do that
[13:58:58] <rwaldron> because the way he's saying "I used this as a reference: It was unintentional - way back in the day - but we've come to embrace it. "
[13:59:05] <rwaldron> makes no sense
[13:59:08] <rwaldron> because it never worked
[13:59:30] <DaveMethvin> the passing of data never worked, intentionally as your fiddle showed
[13:59:40] <DaveMethvin> we never intended for inline handlers to get jquery data
[13:59:40] <rwaldron> right right
[13:59:46] <rwaldron> exactly
[13:59:56] <DaveMethvin> dogs and cats sleeping together etc
[14:00:07] <rwaldron> I guess I'm just not sure why the OP tried to say that it "[used to work back in the day]"
[14:00:17] <rwaldron> ...mass hysteria
[14:00:21] <rwaldron> ;)
[14:00:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah i don't know what he was referring to so thats why i asked for clarification
[14:00:32] <rwaldron> gotcha
[14:00:34] <rwaldron> great!
[14:00:42] <rwaldron> so, did i read correctly?
[14:00:51] <rwaldron> you'll be at the coop next week
[14:00:53] <rwaldron> ?
[14:01:00] <DaveMethvin> yep, i'll be there
[14:01:02] <tbranyen> :O
[14:01:04] <rwaldron> neat!
[14:01:26] <rwaldron> http://theoatmeal.com/comics/wwddd
[16:03:38] <rwaldron> timmywil "the attached diff fixes both problems"
[16:03:50] <rwaldron> sometimes i wish i wasn't involed in open source projects
[16:06:00] <timmywil> rwaldron: heh, good times
[16:27:00] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[16:27:08] <rwaldron> I've jsut discovered something crazy
[16:27:10] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[16:27:13] <rwaldron> anyone?
[16:36:34] <rwaldron> kswedberg !
[16:36:44] <kswedberg> rwaldron!
[16:36:49] <rwaldron> hey dude
[16:36:53] <kswedberg> I just saw that api doc change
[16:36:55] <rwaldron> did you see the email i just sent to api?
[16:37:00] <kswedberg> yeah
[16:37:12] <rwaldron> i just want to make sure we're all on the same page
[16:37:25] <rwaldron> it seemed drastic
[16:37:33] <rwaldron> but totally necessary
[16:37:49] <kswedberg> whoa.
[16:37:58] <rwaldron> i was poking through the code trying to resolve the bug and then i looked at the blame on github and the code has been the same for a very long time
[16:38:00] <kswedberg> I could have sworn that it handled that.
[16:38:04] <kswedberg> but guess not
[16:38:47] <kswedberg> so multi-namespaced .bind() works but not .unbind()?
[16:38:50] <rwaldron> so i went and ran that example against 1.2.6 and that version removed one of the namespaces, but not both
[16:39:01] <rwaldron> 1.3.2+ dont remove any
[16:39:14] <kswedberg> crazy
[16:39:41] <kswedberg> now I'm curious about when that was added to the doc. wondering if we got it wrong in the book, too.
[16:39:51] <rwaldron> ruh roh
[16:40:40] <kswedberg> uh yeah. that's embarrassing. looks like we did have that erratum in the book.
[16:40:53] <kswedberg> (I like saying erratum. it sounds vaguely obscene)
[16:40:53] <rwaldron> not embarassing
[16:41:01] <rwaldron> it totally does
[16:41:06] <kswedberg> :)
[16:41:11] <rwaldron> its like erotic errection and rectum
[16:41:18] <rwaldron> erection* that is
[16:41:24] <rwaldron> ugh, i need a shower
[16:41:29] <kswedberg> thanks for that! I WANTED IT SPELLED OUT!
[16:41:34] <rwaldron> hahahahahahahahaha
[16:41:37] <rwaldron> kdjfnkjzdfkvjndzf;vkjdfv
[16:42:02] <kswedberg> rwaldron: thanks a lot for fixing the doc
[16:42:11] <rwaldron> i wrote a really good test for this too
[16:42:16] <rwaldron> le sigh
[16:42:20] <rwaldron> you're welcome
[16:42:23] <rwaldron> i was sorta worried
[16:42:30] <rwaldron> because, adding or editting is one thing
[16:42:48] <rwaldron> docucide is another
[16:43:01] <kswedberg> haha. but necessary in this case.
[16:43:14] <rwaldron> maybe I'll try to make this work
[16:43:21] <rwaldron> considering I have a test case for it now
[16:43:33] <rwaldron> it makes use of the expect number
[16:43:48] <rwaldron> expect(2), but 4 events are triggered
[16:44:05] <addyosmani> fix it and you might have to put those docs back in :p
[16:44:05] <rwaldron> if the handler fires 4 times = fail
[16:44:09] <addyosmani> great find regardless!
[16:44:22] <kswedberg> ah. not sure how far DaveMethvin is in his events work, but might be worth pinging him about it, too.
[16:44:22] <rwaldron> i'll hold onto the old version
[16:44:28] <rwaldron> goooood call
[16:44:31] <rwaldron> forgot about that
[16:44:31] <kswedberg> it's versioned anyway
[16:44:50] <kswedberg> In WordPress's own cute versiony sort of way
[16:44:54] <addyosmani> <3 versioning
[16:45:03] <rwaldron> ok, i
[16:45:05] <rwaldron> ack
[16:45:07] <rwaldron> i'm heading out
[16:45:13] <rwaldron> good weekend guys
[16:45:18] <addyosmani> you too, dude
[16:45:18] <kswedberg> ok. talk to you later!
[16:45:23] <rwaldron> later!
[16:58:09] <sean`> re: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9786
[16:58:20] <sean`> like, if I $('div').filter ('.foo.bar')
[16:58:38] <sean`> I'll just get stuff that matches both classes
[16:59:15] <sean`> So, perhaps the docs wasn't specific enough, but I do feel that .unbind ('.foo.bar') should only remove what those namespaces
[17:00:04] <sean`> what's ben attached by both of those namespaces*
