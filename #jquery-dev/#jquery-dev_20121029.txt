[08:22:53] <Wilto> whatup corebros
[08:23:59] <gnarf> not much
[08:25:41] <Wilto> Hey I got you guys a present.
[08:25:53] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4860#issuecomment-9827362
[08:25:54] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #4860 on jquery-mobile (bittlelum; 2m, 1w ago): Search input type is case-sensitive
[08:25:58] <Wilto> NO TAKE BACKS YOURS NOW BYE
[08:26:45] <Wilto> DaveMethvin: I dunno what we wanna do about the above.
[08:26:48] <mikesherov> Wilto: no!
[08:26:52] <Wilto> TOO LATE
[08:27:13] <Wilto> I mean, it is a Sizzle deal, but it‚Äôs a whole can of worms. Not something we can patch up on the Mobile side, for sure.
[08:27:21] <DaveMethvin> agreed on that Wilto
[08:27:35] <mikesherov> Yeah, in all seriousness, it's something we'll have to tackle
[08:27:44] <DaveMethvin> imma send you a hurrycane as a thankyou gift
[08:27:53] <mikesherov> to do the "Right Thing(c)"
[08:27:56] <Wilto> nope I‚Äôm good got one already
[08:28:09] <DaveMethvin> i'm in Baltimre
[08:28:13] <DaveMethvin> Baltimore even
[08:28:19] <mikesherov> I'm in Long Island
[08:28:24] <mikesherov> so I'll be underwater soon
[08:28:26] <DaveMethvin> we both are screwed
[08:28:34] <Wilto> Boston ain‚Äôt scurred.
[08:28:41] <mikesherov> I have an internet though
[08:28:42] <DaveMethvin> updated my will to leave the bug tracker to Wilto
[08:28:44] <mikesherov> so I'm ok
[08:28:56] <Wilto> We‚Äôre gonna be on our roofs throwing batteries at the hurricane and chanting about the Yankees for no discernable reason.
[08:28:58] <mikesherov> I will too!
[08:29:26] <mikesherov> only 139 bugs left to triage in jQuery UI: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/query?status=new&type=bug&group=component&col=id&col=summary&col=version&report=30&order=id
[08:29:33] <DaveMethvin> wow
[08:29:36] <mikesherov> Which sounds insane
[08:29:47] <mikesherov> but that's down from 450 2 weeks ago
[08:30:08] <mikesherov> it's just resizable and sortable now
[08:30:28] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph?days=100
[08:30:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah you really put a dent in that
[08:31:08] <mikesherov> and tj. vantoll
[08:31:09] <Wilto> Anyway, we‚Äôre closing the bug I just gifted to you all.
[08:31:14] <mikesherov> HOORAY
[08:31:22] <mikesherov> Wilto: did you open an issue?
[08:31:23] <Wilto> Anyone wanna comment with ‚Äúoh hello this is a core issue,‚Äù or what.
[08:31:26] <Wilto> Nah. I can.
[08:31:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah do that, we might as well face the bug
[08:31:43] <DaveMethvin> thanks Wilto
[08:32:01] <mikesherov> Wilto: I'll chime in, just make a core bug first and I'll do all the handwaving
[08:32:25] <gnarf> Wilto / DaveMethvin - didn't we do some research last week on that bug? the stuff inside the quotes of an attribute selector is case sensitive according to spec?
[08:32:31] <Wilto> ‚ÄúFace the Bug‚Äù was an underappreciated mid-90‚Äôs rock opera based on Kafka‚Äôs Metamorphosis.
[08:32:58] <Wilto> gnarf: Yeah. ‚ÄúEnumerated values‚Äù are case-insensitive; not all of ‚Äôem are.
[08:33:02] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: attributes that are "enumerated values" are not case sensitive
[08:33:06] <mikesherov> gnarf: unclear
[08:33:07] <DaveMethvin> what he said
[08:33:10] <gnarf> oh so lame
[08:33:13] <mikesherov> right
[08:33:18] <DaveMethvin> extremely lame
[08:33:21] <gnarf> so like we'd have to list the "enum" values?
[08:33:25] <mikesherov> STANDARDS are awesome
[08:33:27] <Wilto> Yep.
[08:33:41] <DaveMethvin> well, getAttributeNode has an .enumerated property i think
[08:33:44] <mikesherov> like, it's 2012. Just make the standard not dumb now, and break back compat
[08:33:45] <DaveMethvin> but isn't that deprecated?
[08:33:55] <Wilto> ?mlm
[08:33:55] <bot-t> much like myself
[08:36:20] <gnarf> wow - this is INSANE
[08:36:40] <gnarf> or wait, type="INSANE" ?
[08:37:59] <gnarf> seriously? http://jsfiddle.net/QMweQ/2/
[08:38:02] <gnarf> wtf CSS
[08:39:19] <mikesherov> CSS: best spec ever
[08:39:30] <mikesherov> as wilto and I discussed last week
[08:39:37] <mikesherov> especially getComputedStyle
[08:39:52] <DaveMethvin> gotta run off for a few minutes, back for the meeting at noon
[08:40:56] <mikesherov> gnarf: yes, although it makes some sense
[08:41:01] <mikesherov> in a weird way
[08:41:13] <mikesherov> enum values are case sensitive because they're constants
[08:41:35] <mikesherov> but it's like a dumb optimization
[08:44:50] <Wilto> ?mlm
[08:44:50] <bot-t> much like myself
[08:44:59] <mikesherov> ?ts
[08:44:59] <bot-t> That's Sexual‚Ñ¢
[08:45:12] <mikesherov> ?woah

[08:48:01] <Wilto> I made you guys a present.
[08:48:03] <Wilto> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12801
[08:49:50] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: I can't find .enumerated in the spec
[08:55:11] <mikesherov> Wilto: hands waved
[08:55:20] <Wilto> huzzah
[08:55:30] <mikesherov> Wilto: are there any other bugs we can take off your hands?
[08:55:43] <Wilto> You guys heard of these new ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù phones?
[08:55:47] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[08:55:57] <mikesherov> Oh man
[08:56:00] <Wilto> We have a few of those bugs; we were hoping you guys could take them all TOO LATE NO TAKE-BACKS BYE
[08:56:19] <mikesherov> No, honestly, which versions of Android browser?
[08:56:28] <mikesherov> 2.4 and 2.3 are notoriously terrible
[08:56:52] <mikesherov> stupid 2.4 was the reason we couldn't move forward with document.readyState === interactive in 1.8
[08:59:46] <Wilto> 1.6‚Äì4.0.
[08:59:54] <Wilto> In unique and horrible ways.
[09:00:00] <Wilto> 2.2/2.3 is the worst.
[09:00:12] <DaveMethvin> amen bro
[09:01:05] <Wilto> Drink this one in: https://github.com/scottjehl/Device-Bugs/issues/3
[09:01:06] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #3 on Device-Bugs (Wilto; 7m, 1w ago): Android 2.2/2.3‚Äôs Native Browser and Fixed Positioning
