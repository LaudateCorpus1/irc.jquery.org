[05:45:04] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15ForbesLindesay opened pull request #1476: Pass window to intro if available (06master...06patch-1) 02http://git.io/90lI3g
[05:59:39] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Don't you just love the browserify folks?
[05:59:49] <m_gol> always sth ;)
[06:01:06] <DaveMethvin> all 18 of them, but they sure know how to type
[06:04:28] <m_gol> so how many node-related intro commits did we have?
[06:04:48] <m_gol> but it's all so intuitive ;)
[06:06:15] <DaveMethvin> well m_gol you have to realize how perfect fit of the nodejs require() and module setup is for the client-side browser, it's great!
[06:06:25] <DaveMethvin> :(
[06:07:09] <m_gol> so we have global, this & window
[06:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> If I had my way, we wouldn't be dealing with any of this ;-)
[06:07:49] <m_gol> in browser we have `this === window` and no `global`, in node we have `global !== this` and no `window` and in browserify we have all 3 of them, all different
[06:08:14] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: what was your way? to give up on browserify compatibility?
[06:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:08:49] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't even want to give in to AMD. I wanted to just wait for ES6.
[06:08:57] <m_gol> but we're constantly so close to being compatible, lol
[06:09:17] <DaveMethvin> missed it by THAT MUCH
[06:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> perpertually almost useful
[06:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> Next up: publishing jQuery as 30 modules on npm.
[06:10:09] <DaveMethvin> nope
[06:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> Because managing that sounds like so much fun.
[06:10:32] <DaveMethvin> i don't see how these guys are completely blind to how much new public surface that exposes
[06:10:43] <m_gol> 30 is too low, remember: one module per function!
[06:10:52] <DaveMethvin> it's one of the problems with open source, unfortunately, if you can see it then it's documented
[06:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> I still firmly stand by this comment: https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/36#issuecomment-14197092
[06:11:28] <DaveMethvin> but for example, when we switch to es6 modules i know there will be someone who whines they were consuming amd modules
[06:11:46] <m_gol> AMD should just build a compatibility layer to ES6 modules
[06:11:53] <m_gol> npm folks plan to AFAIK
[06:11:58] <DaveMethvin> i agree with that comment scott
[06:12:25] <DaveMethvin> that's why i want to use plain old standard DOM Promises and some standard shim with $.xhr and $.json
[06:12:32] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We could've traded that whining for current whining by not implementing AMD.
[06:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> But that's a lost cause.
[06:13:22] <DaveMethvin> i don't see the refactoring with amd as bad from that aspect, we refactored and have a better custom build
[06:13:41] <DaveMethvin> and the dependencies are right there in the file, rather than a list in the grunt task
[06:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I don't care about AMD for internal use.
[06:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> But we spent a TON of time debating and tweaking the exposed AMD code.
[06:17:17] <DaveMethvin> not as much as we spent on code style :P
[06:17:20] <scott_gonzalez> Hell, require.js added a new property specifically for jQuery, right?
[06:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I never said I was happy about how much time we spent on code style :-)
[06:17:40] <DaveMethvin> lol
[06:17:51] <m_gol> that's a bold statement ;)
[06:18:01] <DaveMethvin> all i'm sayin is we gotta have SOMETHING to talk about
[06:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:18:30] <scott_gonzalez> Just think what we could accomplish if we had all that time back. We could probably get XHTML 2.0 revived! :-P
[06:18:50] <DaveMethvin> idle hands do the devil's work
[06:19:09] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, is that why we keep busy? So we don't accidentally do bad stuff?
[06:19:26] <DaveMethvin> on the upside, i think i have that guy convinced that he's asking for something kind of complicated
[06:19:35] <DaveMethvin> for browserify
[06:21:25] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe, but the tricky part is convincing him that it shouldn't happen.
[06:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> Lots of people want things they know to be complex.
[06:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> And of course there's the usual justification of "I'll build it"
[06:22:38] * scott_gonzalez gets back to real work ;-)
[06:22:46] <DaveMethvin> wish i could get back to real work
[06:22:59] <DaveMethvin> i got my moms computer last night and brought it home
[06:23:11] <DaveMethvin> gotta try to get the data off the bad drive
[06:24:52] <scott_gonzalez> Good luck with that.
[06:41:03] <m_gol> hehe, it seems I took it too simple
[06:41:11] <m_gol> global in browserify is window AFAIK
[06:41:39] <m_gol> so: in browser we have `this === window` and no `global`, in server-side node we have `global !== this === module.exports` and no `window` and in browserify we have `this === module.exports` and `window === global`
[08:14:46] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Any objection to adding a note on http://jquery.com/browser-support/ about pre-release channels?
[08:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically that we will not land bug fixes for beta and dev releases of browsers.
[08:15:23] <DaveMethvin> sounds reasonable scott_gonzalez 
[08:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> Just add a sentence in the Unsupported Browsers section?
[08:16:18] <DaveMethvin> yep, maybe suggest they report a bug to the browser maker
[08:17:54] <scott_gonzalez> Similarly, jQuery does not fix bugs in pre-release versions of browsers, such as beta or dev releases. If you find a bug with jQuery in a pre-release of a browser, you should report the bug to the browser vendor.
