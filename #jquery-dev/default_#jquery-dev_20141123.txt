[12:55:24] <neymello> hello guys.. I am working on a presentation about JQuery development ... And for the presentation I have to say how the conflicts between members are solved in the project
[12:55:59] <neymello> can somebody help me with this question?
[15:16:24] <pitch4k> hey guys, I have a question
[15:17:23] <pitch4k> If I try to run the jQuery tests with the "Load with AMD" config, I get "Uncaught ReferenceError: noGlobal is not defined"
[15:17:32] <pitch4k> is this remotely normal?
[15:19:28] <m_gol> pitch4k: shouldn't happen but we're not testing this configuration so it's possible we broke something. Can you open a bug on jquery/jquery?
[15:20:09] <pitch4k> certainly, thanks
