[07:08:54] <m_gol> timmywil: ping
[07:09:14] <timmywil> hey
[07:09:46] <m_gol> timmywil: I may not be able to solve https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1724 before 10.04
[07:10:17] <m_gol> and starting tomorrow I'll only be available on 7.04 and then 10.04
[07:11:04] <m_gol> it's marked as a blocker so I thought I'd inform you
[07:11:14] <m_gol> I submitted PRs for some other things
[07:11:25] <timmywil> ok, that's fine. would you prefer someone else to grab it?
[07:12:16] <m_gol> depending on how urgent it is
[07:12:31] <m_gol> if doing it 10.04 is fine I can keep it, otherwise sb else would better do it
[07:12:43] <timmywil> I think we can wait. We're going to release the patch first anyway.
[07:12:49] <m_gol> ok

[15:50:59] <ryanneufeld> timmywil:  question for yoiu
[15:51:17] <ryanneufeld> $('#id_cluster').find('option').remove();
[15:51:17] <ryanneufeld> $('option', $('#id_cluster')).remove();
[15:51:39] <ryanneufeld> those lines exactly the same thing, right? If so, is there any benefit to one vs the other?

[16:04:26] <mavihs> Hi.
[16:05:39] <mavihs> All of a sudden, jscs started whining about code style errors like "Missing space after opening round bracket at build/release.js" in QUnit. Even though I changed nothing, it was working fine previously.
[16:05:50] <mavihs> Any suggestions what might have gone wrong?
[16:14:10] <mavihs> Its fixed now. I guessed I messed up with npm.
