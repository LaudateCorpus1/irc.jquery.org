[07:02:44] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Per @gibson042, don't need .documentElement since Sizzle handles.
[07:03:06] <DaveMethvin> LIAR!
[07:03:14] <DaveMethvin> run chrome 20 willya?
[07:04:01] <DaveMethvin> ok i started a new run
[07:04:23] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/396
[07:17:01] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: do you know how a fella can get a Chrome 20 around here? http://swarm.jquery.org/job/396
[07:17:33] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: dunno why that is booting up
[07:17:52] <jzaefferer> unrelated, is it okay for the number of support tests to vary wildly?
[07:18:07] <DaveMethvin> yes
[07:18:16] <DaveMethvin> we do some extra tests on some versions
[07:19:00] <jzaefferer> seems pretty random
[07:19:10] <jzaefferer> Chrome 19: 34, Firefox 12/13: 4
[07:19:24] <DaveMethvin> it does a browser detect and then checks the support values against the ones we expect
[07:19:41] <DaveMethvin> the idea is that we would know when they fix a bug and could remove the feature detect
[07:19:48] <DaveMethvin> bug detect*
[07:20:47] <timmywil> holy crap, did we get a SUCCESS and I missed it?
[07:21:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah timmywil
[07:21:47] <timmywil> sorry I missed the celebration
[07:22:06] <timmywil> I would have played something by Notorious or something
[07:22:19] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/390
[07:22:52] * timmywil cries a little
[07:23:02] <DaveMethvin> removing the css from the swarm frame fixed the ie8 issues
[07:23:14] <timmywil> sweeeet
[07:23:20] <DaveMethvin> and gnarf made the retesting smarter
[07:23:23] <timmywil> and those random effects?
[07:23:34] <DaveMethvin> i changed some timing on a few, but the restests got the rest
[07:23:43] <timmywil> cool
[07:23:54] <timmywil> come back chrome 20
[07:23:54] <DaveMethvin> now if a fella could just get a Chrome 20 around here... :P

[08:00:01] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: do you know who modified css file on swarm.jquery.org without commiting those?
[08:00:18] <jzaefferer> looks like modified font-sizes in bootstrap.css
[08:51:18] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: that was gnarf, we were trying to figure out what was going on with the core test fails ... and yeah the font-size is the culprit
[08:56:32] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: okay. Will check with him to get those changes commited
[13:22:07] <gnarf> jzaefferer: we wanted to talk to you
[13:22:17] <gnarf> jzaefferer: because the 'run page' should probably not have any CSS
[13:22:31] <gnarf>  /cc Krinkle ^^
[13:27:02] <gnarf> clarkbox: you around?
[13:33:12] <gibson042> .
[13:38:20] <Krinkle> gnarf: it should have css, its just a regular host page. it shouldn't affect the frames inside
[13:38:34] <Krinkle> knowing that it does affect it however, the solution is to not use iframes
[13:38:35] <Krinkle> a
[13:38:45] <Krinkle> and we've already discussed that and there is an open bug for that and a solution
[13:38:53] <Krinkle> that will also fix various other bugs
[13:39:07] <Krinkle> but that takes time to develop, time I currently don't have while in san francisco
[13:40:20] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/issues/195
[13:40:20] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #195 on testswarm (Krinkle; 1m, 1w ago): RunPage should not use iframes for testing
[13:42:28] <gnarf> Krinkle: alrighty - we just figured that the minimalist way to go might work
[13:51:08] <Krinkle> gnarf: maybe, but isn't core passing now ?
[13:51:09] <Krinkle> what up?
[13:51:29] <gnarf> Krinkle: with a 14px font size change in bootstrap.min.css - it passes
[13:51:51] <gnarf> I just figured there was a better place to put that 14px override than in an upstream css file
[13:52:04] <gnarf> and figured id wait for someone who could actually land i
[13:52:05] <gnarf> it
[13:59:47] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #295: STILL FAILING in 4 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/295/
[14:02:05] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle gnarf does the iframe that runs the test need any css?
[14:02:29] <gnarf> hrm
[14:02:33] <Krinkle> (that could be done from within jquery/jquery/test
[14:02:34] <gnarf> firefox 14 just showed up in swarm
[14:02:42] <gnarf> were we expecting that? :)
[14:02:42] <Krinkle> jzaefferer added that
[14:03:10] <Krinkle> it is not in testswarm-browserstack yet
[14:03:26] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Did you also add ff14 to 'popular' on swarm srv ?
[14:03:30] <Krinkle> that would make it fail
[14:05:22] <gnarf> it looks like ff13/14 are "popular" now
[14:05:31] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/404
[14:05:35] <Krinkle> damn it
[14:05:56] * Krinkle commits to testswarm-browserstack
[14:07:09] <gnarf> Krinkle: i just added FF14 and fixed Chrome 20 in the map
[14:07:38] <gnarf> (on the server)
[14:07:49] <Krinkle> fixed c20 how?
[14:08:01] <gnarf> Krinkle: chrome 20 is now "Chrome 20.0" not "Chrome 20.0b"
[14:08:14] <Krinkle> according to Google or according to BrowserStack API ?
[14:08:21] <gnarf> Krinkle: browserstack api
[14:08:38] <gnarf> 21.0b <---
[14:08:59] <gnarf> DaveMethvin et all - jzaefferer: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/404  -- wtf FF14
[14:09:01] <Krinkle> yeah, I know, but the browserstack ID was 20.0b for a long time while 21.0 was also in the api already
[14:09:31] <Krinkle> I'm writing a reply to browerstack now asking them to not ever include 'b' in browser IDs again from now on
[14:09:47] <Krinkle> totally pointless and increases maintenance
[14:09:53] <gnarf> at least in the API :)
[14:10:02] <gnarf> in the "description" on their site, the "b" might make sense
[14:10:05] <Krinkle> exactly
[14:10:18] <gnarf> so - wtf is up with FF 14 blowing up on like every test
[14:10:20] <Krinkle> I'd argue its pointless there too, but whatever.
[14:11:25] <gnarf> Krinkle: if you want to commit my newest "map.js" - copy it from scp krinkle@swarm.jquery.org:/usr/local/bin/tools/testswarm-browserstack/lib/map.js
[14:12:52] <Krinkle> what's up with http://swarm.jquery.org/favicon.ico ?
[14:13:00] <Krinkle> why do we have a jquery.com favicon there?
[14:13:10] <Krinkle> that's new
[14:13:13] <gnarf> cuz i got tired of seeing it in the error log?
[14:13:15] <Krinkle> wait.. it was moved to the new server?
[14:13:22] <gnarf> Krinkle: on monday
[14:13:29] <gnarf> Krinkle: well - sunday night
[14:13:32] <Krinkle> gnarf: Just a plain $ touch ./favicon.ico would've fixed the error
[14:13:44] <Krinkle> no need to put something in there that looks confusing, but whatever
[14:14:00] <Krinkle> gnarf: so you don't need me to move it anymore I suppose? Or are some things not migrated yet?
[14:14:19] <gnarf> Krinkle: i think most of it moved cleanly - we had to do some tweaks to the nginx config
[14:15:19] <gnarf> your example nginx block had a -f in it which should of been a -e
[14:15:24] <gnarf> otherwise its generally stable
[14:15:24] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/110410
[14:15:33] <gnarf> check /etc/nginx/conf.d/swarm.conf
[14:15:35] <Krinkle> the exception is logged and shown in the results frame
[14:15:38] <Krinkle> [TestSwarm] window.onerror: Script error.
[14:16:18] <gnarf> I'm gonna drop a qunit build in there
[14:16:21] <gnarf> see if it passes qunit
[14:16:39] <gnarf> so btw
[14:16:47] <gnarf> right here is a sticky point in the testswarm
[14:17:09] <Krinkle> I can't spend more time on this right now. got stuff to do.
[14:17:11] <gnarf> swarm lists itself as having an "online" client - but that client is ruled out from performing whatever last test is needed
[14:17:33] <Krinkle> I have to prioritize now, sorry. I'll be online again later tonight
[14:17:37] <gnarf> nop
[14:17:42] <gnarf> er no prob
[14:19:26] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: got some issues in FF14 we need to solve
[14:20:18] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[14:21:09] <DaveMethvin> SOME???
[14:22:46] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: are those real, or just swarm strangeness?
[14:23:01] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #296: STILL FAILING in 22 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/296/
[14:23:16] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: they are consistent
[14:23:22] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i did reruns on most of them
[14:23:36] <DaveMethvin> well i have ff14 let me check locally
[14:24:34] <DaveMethvin> works fine here gnarf
[14:24:58] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: well its really fucked in swarm - can you point your ff14 at the swarm run url?
[14:28:22] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[14:28:23] <doesallmagic> Project QUnit build #172: FIXED in 7 min 21 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/172/
[14:52:24] <johnbender> gnarf: DaveMethvin: it probably doesn't matter for you guys but the url in test results link is _not_ the url that the test is run under
[14:52:34] <johnbender> large query string
[14:52:44] <gnarf> johnbender: ?
[14:53:08] <johnbender> gnarf: when you view the testswarm results, the link you click takes to to the git commit subdir for the project yes?
[14:53:27] <johnbender> in the left column of the results table
[14:53:47] <johnbender> it's missing the large query string which is included in the actual request
[14:54:00] <gnarf> johnbender: yeah - the swarm control stuff
[14:54:03] <johnbender> right
[14:54:15] <johnbender> firefox doesn't play nicely with encoded query strings in a hash
[14:54:16] <gnarf> johnbender: you gotta run it from http://swarm.jquery.org/run/username/?run_token=......
[14:54:18] <johnbender> so we had to fix that
[14:54:43] <johnbender> gnarf: anyway, I'm 99% sure that doesn't affect you guys but you never know
[14:55:11] <gnarf> johnbender: yeah this is FF14 + some addon browserstack has installed by default that is causing havoc on jquery's test suite
[14:55:20] <johnbender> ah
[14:55:28] <johnbender> I was worried we would run into that too
[14:55:36] <johnbender> so far so good
[14:55:39] <gnarf> yeah
[14:55:44] <johnbender> though I'm wading through IE failures now :(
[14:55:45] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: have you finished that email yet?
[14:56:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah sent it with you cced
[14:57:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i really hope they don't come back and say " yeah - we already do that... "
[14:58:38] <DaveMethvin> well for now i think we assume ff14 is invalid
[14:59:11] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i wonder how many of the other errors (ie8 css issue) might be caused by the debug tools
[14:59:23] <DaveMethvin> dun dun DUN!
[15:14:02] <w00tner> hello, can anyone help me out with json and jquery ?
[15:14:26] <w00tner> i already have the json file, and i can retrieve data using console.log()
[15:14:44] <w00tner> I just want to know how to insert this content into divs using javascript
[15:15:11] <w00tner> Im using $.getJSON()
