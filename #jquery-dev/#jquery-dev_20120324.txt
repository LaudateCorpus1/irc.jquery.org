[09:06:01] <ben_alman> hey jqury plugin site people, any progress on .. it?
[09:06:19] <ben_alman> i'd love grunt's jquery plugin generated package.json to be awesome for it
[09:06:29] <ben_alman> but i've yet to get any feedback or recommendations
[09:07:11] <ajpiano> what wouldn't be awesome about it
[09:07:24] <ben_alman> i dunno, the format could be all wrong
[09:07:35] <ajpiano> the format hasn't changed
[09:07:36] <ben_alman> i was just winging it
[09:08:47] <ajpiano> that's probably not th feedback you were looking for
[09:09:07] <ben_alman> yeah i'd like someone to try it out and see where it could be improved
[09:09:11] <ajpiano> ben_alman: you should poke around on this stuff during the week, more folks around there
[09:09:13] <ajpiano> then*
[09:09:28] <ben_alman> yeah, the thing is that people will either want to do it or not
[09:09:39] <ben_alman> it's very hard to motivate people to help with stuff they don't really want to help with
[09:10:31] <ben_alman> but i guess i'll have no choice but to mention it on thursday if nobody has looked at it before then
[09:10:44] <ajpiano> i feel like in oss
[09:10:48] <ben_alman> i just have lots of stuff on my plate and am looking for contributions from others
[09:10:49] <ajpiano> people help when there's A Problem
[09:10:53] <ben_alman> yeah
[09:11:04] <ben_alman> the thing is, if there's 100 generated jquery plugins and then there's a problem
[09:11:08] <ajpiano> you are looking for Deus Ex Opensourcica
[09:11:11] <ben_alman> it's going to be hard to fix them all after the fact
[09:11:14] <ben_alman> although
[09:11:39] <ajpiano> i don't think that is an actual problem we will encounter
[09:11:47] <ben_alman> if enough people use my grunt jquery plugin template, you'll have to change your api to support it if there are inconsistencies
[09:11:58] <ben_alman> because people will demand it
[09:12:04] <ben_alman> heh
[09:12:06] <ajpiano> ben_alman: so you're saying, right now you aren't getting any usage or feedback
[09:12:11] <ben_alman> correct
[09:12:14] <ajpiano> but then
[09:12:14] <ben_alman> zero feedback
[09:12:19] <ajpiano> ther'es going to be a critical mass of people using it
[09:12:25] <ajpiano> to the extent than minor flaws that may or may not exist
[09:12:28] <ben_alman> exactly, literally billions of people
[09:12:31] <ajpiano> could prove to be crippling problems
[09:12:35] <ben_alman> will be creating jquery plugins with it
[09:12:41] <ben_alman> yeah scaling is a b
[09:12:50] <ajpiano> :D
[09:13:08] <ben_alman> i'm about to start promoting it and pushing it
[09:13:20] <ben_alman> and i want as many loose ends tied up as possible before doing that
[09:13:35] <ben_alman> so i'm asking for feedback
[09:17:20] <ajpiano> i can help you set up a local plugins site if you want next week
[09:17:24] <ajpiano> maybe that would help in your testing?
[09:17:37] <ben_alman> er
[09:18:05] <ben_alman> so you're not interested in helping test
[09:18:06] <ben_alman> that's cool
[09:18:13] <ajpiano> i'm happy to help but i don't know what means "test"
[09:18:17] <ajpiano> create a bunch of juqery plugins
[09:18:18] <ben_alman> create a plugin
[09:18:20] <ajpiano> using grunt?
[09:18:24] <ben_alman> see if it makes sense
[09:18:25] <ben_alman> yeah
[09:18:29] <ajpiano> try to submit it to plugins site? see if it breaks?
[09:18:33] <ben_alman> see if i did anything retarded
[09:18:47] <ben_alman> well no
[09:19:03] <ben_alman> see if the init template is asking the right questions
[09:19:10] <ben_alman> and that it's suggesting proper naming conventions
[09:19:20] <ben_alman> and that the package.json generated is valid
[09:19:42] <ben_alman> you might see subtel things i'm doing that don't exactly jive with what your intentions are
[09:19:48] <ben_alman> despite what the spec says
[09:19:59] <ben_alman> i remember going by the spec, but this was a lnng time ago
[09:20:06] <ajpiano> spec hasn't changed
[09:20:10] <ajpiano> in a while
[09:20:13] <ben_alman> right
[09:20:31] <ben_alman> it seems like i'm failing to communicate with you
[09:20:34] <ben_alman> so i'll try another time
[09:20:46] <ajpiano> i kno what you're saying
[09:20:50] <ben_alman> i'll have to reconsider how i go about asking for what i'm truing to ask
[09:21:08] <ben_alman> maybe "i'm looking for a second set of eyes" or something
[09:21:14] <ben_alman> i'll give it some thought
[09:21:32] <ajpiano> i think the prob is that you know grunt better than anyone obvs
[09:21:51] <ajpiano> and very few of us have mastery over the plguins site stuff either (i wouldn't say i really do, i just kinda... have it here)
[09:22:03] <ben_alman> who does? richard?
[09:22:13] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez mostly
[09:22:16] <ben_alman> who "owns" package.json
[09:22:17] <ben_alman> ok
[09:22:21] <ben_alman> i'll ask scott to try it out then
[09:22:24] <ben_alman> thx
[09:22:34] <ben_alman> since he's also used grunt a lot
[09:22:47] <ajpiano> ah, i didn't know that
[09:23:02] <ben_alman> yes, he joern and rick have used it a lot lately
[09:23:21] <ben_alman> they're working on completely rewriting all the jquery project build processes in grunt
[09:23:30] <ben_alman> and have bben giving me awesome feedback
[09:23:33] <ajpiano> ah yeah, i knew about that, didn't realise scott was in on that
[09:23:41] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:23:51] <ben_alman> you should give it a whirl
[09:23:52] <ajpiano> i guess i would just say
[09:23:56] <ajpiano> yeah i'm doing that now
[09:23:57] <ben_alman> maybe you'd have awesome feedback for me too
[09:24:11] <ajpiano> i'm just saying, you gotta realise that feedback is probably just gonna dribble in slowly
[09:24:18] <ben_alman> yes
[09:24:21] <ajpiano> there aren't exactly a tonne of people starting brand new jquery plugins every day
[09:24:29] <ben_alman> but there are certain things i want feedback on
[09:24:37] <ben_alman> mainly the init templates at this point
[09:24:41] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:24:51] <ajpiano> and also i'm gonna try not to ask you questions cause the idea is to like
[09:24:56] <ajpiano> figure out how to do it from the docs
[09:24:59] <ajpiano> i assume :)
[09:25:04] <ben_alman> yes i need to know where the docs are inadequate
[09:25:09] <ben_alman> i'm working on init task docs now actually
[09:25:16] <ben_alman> so there isn't much yet
[09:25:47] <ben_alman> btw i made this insane expect script to fully automate generation of repos from all the grunt init templates, capture full transcripts and upload them to github
[09:25:51] <ben_alman> it's sooo amazing
[09:25:58] <ben_alman> and was a total PITA to create
[09:26:15] <ben_alman> but i consider it part of my docs now
[09:26:19] <ajpiano> haha yea i remember you showing it
[09:27:51] <ben_alman> feel free to comment in #grunt if this is OT for here
[09:28:08] <ben_alman> it certainly won't be OT for there
[09:28:12] <ajpiano> haha
[11:40:17] <mikesherov> .

[19:03:13] <sindresorhus_> .
[20:18:04] <DaveMethvin> .
[22:29:47] <RealityBall> hello I am a noob and I was just wondering
[22:29:56] <RealityBall> if jquery and javascript are interchangeable
[22:30:28] <RealityBall> like can I have an if statement written in javascript and a statement to run written in jquery if the statement is true?
[22:31:07] <snover> RealityBall: this is not the support channel.
[22:31:21] <RealityBall> snover: ahhh alright my bad
