[06:04:42] <DaveMethvin> m_gol markelog any luck on the problem with sinon timers?
[06:05:33] <markelog> DaveMethvin: on my local browsers they work okay, just like with that url http://builds.jenkins.jquery.com/jquery/a3cd88f14bc99cbb80e6abe939576cbed093cb47/test/index.html?module=effects
[06:05:41] <markelog> but swarm shows error
[06:06:00] <markelog> i'm not sure who is lying
[06:06:23] <DaveMethvin> strange
[06:06:33] <markelog> also we have one legit failure in IE6 for attributes module
[06:06:40] <markelog> will PR it a bit later
[06:06:58] <DaveMethvin> ok ... just trying to decide whether we should do the RC today
[06:07:32] <markelog> DaveMethvin: can you check out on your browsers effects module?
[06:07:55] <DaveMethvin> yep, let me check
[06:11:11] <DaveMethvin> markelog: ie6, ie7, ie8 all passed
[06:11:21] <DaveMethvin> and so fast!
[06:13:53] <DaveMethvin> oh did Krinkle|detached ever change the use of setTimeout in the injected code markelog? If not that may be what's breaking
[06:14:43] <markelog> yeah sinon is awesome that way
[06:14:46] <markelog> :-)
[06:14:59] <markelog> we probably could use for some subset of ajax tests too
[06:16:31] <DaveMethvin> well, saving the real setTimeout at the top of https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/js/inject.js wouldn't hurt, even if it isn't the cause of this problem
[06:18:20] <markelog> i guess no one yet used swarm, qunit, timers_ie and sinon together
[06:18:48] <markelog> so it might be a new problem for us to deal with
[06:19:10] <DaveMethvin> well at least that link from above works, so we must be close!
[06:20:25] <markelog> we could restart the swarm job as i remember to confirm its consistency
[06:20:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah i can do that
[06:26:05] <DaveMethvin> UGH http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201.x/350/console
[06:26:45] <DaveMethvin> it built ok but can't talk to jq01
[06:27:40] <DaveMethvin> gnarf s5fs  ^^ maybe does the server need to be whitelisted, was this related to the codeorigin change yesterday?
[06:29:04] <gnarf> nah
[06:29:08] <gnarf> something else
[06:30:56] <gnarf> i'm gonna start a call to (mt)
[06:31:08] <DaveMethvin> thanks gnarf 
[08:35:00] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle|detached scott_gonzalez et al: QUnit Team Meeting?
[08:42:31] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Yep
[08:42:51] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: We can chat here isntead.
[08:50:53] <JamesMGreene> No major updates other than I should be able to start spending some limited time on QUnit & co. again now.
[08:51:01] <JamesMGreene> Any preference on issues to start with?
[08:51:34] <JamesMGreene> I know jzaefferer asked me to extract the phantomjs plugin so I can do that first
[08:52:42] <Krinkle> Yeah, that's a good one to take.
[08:53:14] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: My work on QUnit.Assertion and QUnit.Test have been deferred a bit (I've been working on it locally, but nothing pushable yet, I did push a WIP in December but haven't pushed since)
[08:53:45] <Krinkle> In December I was longer away from home that I thought, and had some other distractions in January (family member in the hospital). All sorted now though.
[08:54:37] <Krinkle> So I'll get back on that, and I've been keeping testswarm user agents updated and bugging browserstack with various issues that came up (iOS 7, Safari 7, and latest Firefox each had some issues when they were first exposed in their API, fixed now though)
[08:55:33] <jzaefferer> hey JamesMGreene Krinkle; forgot about this again :/
[08:55:46] <jzaefferer> Good to hear you both will be more available
[08:56:05] <jzaefferer> While I've released 1.13, I've got a lot of other stuff to work on before coming back to QUnit
[08:56:26] <jzaefferer> Somewhat testing-related, my commitplease module is now working pretty well: https://github.com/jzaefferer/commitplease
[08:57:08] <jzaefferer> And yes, getting the last addon out of the QUnit repo would be good
[09:03:11] <JamesMGreene> Cool
[09:04:18] <JamesMGreene> Any other high priority tasks/issues for QUnit, or should I just choose for myself (after extracting the "phantomjs" plugin)?
[09:04:38] <Krinkle> I'm currentlt refactoring js files in jquery/testswarm to confirm with coding style and to fix the setTimeout bug
[09:04:45] <Krinkle> conform*
[09:06:58] <JamesMGreene> Did we ever patch that issue that allows additional tests to be run after `QUnit.done` was already called?
[09:11:48] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: I don't think so, at this moment I think that is a QUnit feature
[09:21:51] <JamesMGreene> "feature" indeed, lol
[09:22:27] <JamesMGreene> That's not what I recall us calling it in Portland when we discovered that we didn't know our tests were failing because Grunt exits after the `QUnit.done` ;)
[09:27:34] <JamesMGreene> DaveMethvin: So I got a little confused by the Standards/Collaboration email chain: are you going to pull Standards work from the Wiki page or did you want it emailed to you?
[09:28:05] <JamesMGreene> (when writing your blog post)
[09:28:27] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gm0gzpFNqt3UW7tjTki5YYsjMDrBXqe8G2FVxq2JTfM/edit
[09:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> You can just throw stuff at the very top.
[09:32:37] <JamesMGreene> kthx
[09:42:43] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Both grunt and testswarm will stop after the first qunit.done, as they should because there is no way of knowing whether there will be more.
[09:42:47] <Krinkle> I suppose it's more of a debug feature
[09:43:02] <Krinkle> I think it's fine to deprecate and remove it, I don't recommend we keep it.
[09:43:16] <Krinkle> But I wouldn't classify it as a bug, afaik it was kept on purpose (maybe not introduced on purpose though)

[11:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Standards post looks good.
[11:02:48] <DaveMethvin> thanks scott_gonzalez, wp draft here: http://blog.jquery.com/?p=3283&preview=true&preview_id=3283&public=1&nonce=aab17bee3d
[11:06:54] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: it looks good to me too, i left one comment though
[11:07:07] <DaveMethvin> yep, included another sentence ajpiano 
[11:07:17] <ajpiano> ah i see it there
[11:48:03] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: afaik, the selectors API will need to change the name of findAll
[11:48:19] <timmywil> but I don't know how necessary it is to point that out
[11:48:44] <DaveMethvin> i wasn't going to mention findAll but scott_gonzalez suggested it, mainly its about qSA sucking and unable to be fixed
[11:48:53] <timmywil> agreed
[11:49:11] <DaveMethvin> oh so timmywil  do you think you could do the rc tonight?
[11:49:20] <DaveMethvin> i THINK we'll be ready
[11:49:22] <timmywil> I do
[11:49:34] <DaveMethvin> right now there are some test issues but i think they just are with swarm
[11:49:46] <DaveMethvin> cool
[11:49:57] <DaveMethvin> are you in TN now, or still out in san fran
[11:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We can switch the order of the UI and core releases if we need to.
[11:50:20] <scott_gonzalez> Since core's an RC, it won't get pulled into UI anyway.
[11:50:56] <DaveMethvin> i really think we'll be ready, and the blog post won't need to be very long
[11:51:13] <DaveMethvin> i'll do more for the final release, which if we're lucky will be next week
[11:51:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:18:15] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: timmywil said findAll is not current name
[12:18:58] <DaveMethvin> let me just delete that sentence
[12:19:20] <DaveMethvin> done
[12:20:07] <m_gol> http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-parentnode-queryall
[12:20:11] <m_gol> it seems it's queryAll
[12:20:43] <DaveMethvin> it wasn't an important point so i'll just leave it out, esp since it will probably change again :)
[12:20:52] <m_gol> removing "Selector" from the name brings sanity back ;)
[12:21:22] <m_gol> sorry for being a little ephemeral, I thought I'd have time but I had a little storm at work
[12:21:27] <m_gol> how's the Sinon issue going?
[12:22:00] <DaveMethvin> i think it's fixed on our side
[12:22:11] <DaveMethvin> waiting for a testswarm update to see if the last issue goes away
[12:22:11] <m_gol> oh, great :)
[12:22:24] <m_gol> I've seen tests stopped at random times, what was that?
[12:22:33] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2345
[12:22:51] <DaveMethvin> i think it was because we stole setTimeout from poor inject.js
[12:23:10] <DaveMethvin> as Krinkle pointed out, the setup/teardown runs per test
[12:23:29] <DaveMethvin> however, if there is a stop() inside the test, well, then inject's setTimeout can run
[12:23:52] <DaveMethvin> and is probably very confused about being faked out
[12:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron wycats_: Do you know if there have been any discussions about updates to the Date object?
[12:24:30] <m_gol> other than that, tests look quite good
[12:24:47] <m_gol> except 2 issues, one with Chrome 31 (my favorite release...) and one with IE6
[12:24:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah just that one chrome 31 issue that is chrome's fault
[12:25:13] <m_gol> have they fixed it already?
[12:25:23] <DaveMethvin> the ie6 one i think is from that patch markelog pulled out that SAID it was only for blackberry but seems to have also affected IE6
[12:25:30] <DaveMethvin> bad bad comment
[12:25:41] <m_gol> that can happen
[12:25:53] <DaveMethvin> esp for a problem as old as ie6
[12:25:57] <m_gol> you add sth because of one browser and you don't have to notice it fixes sth in another one
[12:26:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:26:17] <m_gol> well, at least we'll get the comment fixed ;)
[12:26:26] <DaveMethvin> so we should talk about dropping ie6/7 support (at least the unit testing) for 1.12/2.2
[12:26:49] <DaveMethvin> by the time it releases (middle of the year?) XP will be unsupported
[12:27:00] <m_gol> do we have any data on how many people relies on that?
[12:27:16] <DaveMethvin> ie7 usage is smaller than ie6 now i think
[12:27:29] <DaveMethvin> http://www.modern.ie/ie6countdown
[12:27:43] * DaveMethvin shakes fist at chinese
[12:27:44] <m_gol> yeah
[12:28:05] <m_gol> depends on the country, though
[12:28:41] <markelog> DaveMethvin: i didn't merge that one yet
[12:28:41] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1482
[12:28:44] <markelog> still open
[12:28:54] <DaveMethvin> oh, ha!
[12:29:08] <markelog> but we can't remove option valhook entirly for 1.x-master
[12:29:16] <markelog> but it can be simplified
[12:29:28] <markelog> including removal of blackberry fix
[12:29:38] <DaveMethvin> markelog: do you think you will be able to get to that in the next few hours?
[12:29:40] <markelog> problem with ie6 is quite awesome
[12:29:47] <markelog> actually
[12:29:53] <markelog> yes
[12:29:57] <DaveMethvin> cool
[12:30:01] <m_gol> btw, it seems iPhone iOS7 fails more tests than iPad iOS7
[12:30:02] <DaveMethvin> so what happened with ie6?
[12:30:08] <m_gol> so we might have to test them both...
[12:30:17] <markelog> will explain all in PR
[12:30:21] <markelog> it will come soon
[12:30:25] <DaveMethvin> great!
[12:30:46] <DaveMethvin> once that lands and we see a good testswarm i think we're ready for the RC
[12:31:04] <markelog> testswarm comming today?
[12:31:37] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: can you land that change to save the real setTimeout? 
[12:31:45] <DaveMethvin> and if it's just oldIE failing on the effects tests I'm still inclined to do the RC tonight
[12:31:54] <DaveMethvin> local runs seem fine
[12:32:08] <markelog> we did that sort of thing before
[12:32:17] <markelog> if local is fine i guess we could
[12:32:37] <jqcommit> 01[13testswarm01] 15Krinkle pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/opDoSw
[12:32:37] <jqcommit> 13testswarm/06master 14d81e522 15Timo Tijhof: inject: Save a reference to setTimeout...
[12:32:38] <DaveMethvin> and the spots where it is randomly failing do seem to be ones that are using stop() and thus could be getting broken by sinon
[12:32:43] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[12:32:50] <DaveMethvin> imma fire off another test
[12:33:39] <Krinkle> Deploying to jq03
[12:33:57] <DaveMethvin> look at me, all trigger happy!
[12:34:22] <DaveMethvin> we'll see who won
[12:34:23] <DaveMethvin> :)
[12:34:25] <DaveMethvin> thanks Krinkle 
[12:34:35] <markelog> DaveMethvin: will work on all that stuff in 30 min or so
[12:34:45] <DaveMethvin> awesome thanks MacHawk 
[12:34:50] <markelog> :-)
[12:34:50] <DaveMethvin> markelog!
[12:34:54] <markelog> you did again
[12:34:56] <DaveMethvin> sorry MacHawk 
[12:35:11] <DaveMethvin> you have betrayed me, tab key
[12:45:10] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez hi! what updates in particular are you wondering about? As far as I know the only updates to Date will be done via ECMA-402 which is the i18n spec: http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/ECMA-402.pdf
[12:45:18] <rwaldron> 13.3 has some definitions 
[12:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> Wondering if they will have better timezone suppoert
[12:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically storing time zones as part of the object.
[12:48:46] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell rxaviers rwaldron pointed me to http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-402/1.0/ECMA-402.pdf re: timezones
[12:48:46] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I’ll tell rxaviers about that.
[12:49:36] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Thanks. It looks like it does add timezone info.
[12:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> Set the [[timeZone]] internal property of dateTimeFormat to tz.
[12:53:35] <DaveMethvin> okay well it still looks like we're getting fails on oldIE but I reset those runs to be sure http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2346
[12:57:37] <DaveMethvin> AHA! IE7 succeeded that time
[12:58:03] <DaveMethvin> there's 4 words you rarely see together
[13:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> If DaveMethvin + succeeded wasn't enough, you've thrown in IE7!
[13:01:19] <DaveMethvin> well of course ie6 and 8 don't seem to be cooperating, so there's that
[13:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> They teamed up to trick you.
[13:06:00] <DaveMethvin> IE7 works but 6 and 8 don't, it's a classic "man in the middle" attack
[13:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> cross-browser test forgery

[15:11:21] <rwaldron> markelog ping
[15:11:26] <markelog>  hey
[15:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> Did timmywil really just close one package manager ticket and accept the other?
[15:18:22] <scott_gonzalez> The world is fucked if we think it's a good idea to crank out a new package manager every month and then after X months have popular projects support them.
[15:18:57] <scott_gonzalez>  /rant
[15:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just refrain from speaking any time package managers and dependency resolution tools come up.
[15:22:14] <gnarf> hrm
[15:22:21] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez +9001
[15:22:34] <gnarf> random thought - i remember seeing someone talk about .each and making a .forEach with the proper syntax
[15:23:00] <gnarf> but our each has the return false semantics
[15:23:31] <gnarf> we don't really map to any of the array iterators very well do we :)
[15:23:33] <rwaldron> I want to punch everything after fighting with a bower module that's shim'ed to to work with an AMD module—whose tests are run in node
[15:23:38] * rwaldron kills self
[15:24:22] <gnarf> rwaldron inception
[15:24:35] <gnarf> (still hasn't seen that movie)
[15:24:43] <rwaldron> There is no way to make jQuery.prototype.each work like Array.prototype.forEach. Tell the next person who asks to piss off.
[15:24:46] <rwaldron> ;)
[15:25:39] <gnarf> if they REALLY want forEach they can borrow from $.fn.forEach = [].forEach; anyway
[15:25:46] <rwaldron> +1
[15:26:34] <m_gol> unfortunately by its virtue there's no standard package manager arriving
[15:26:42] <gnarf> timmywil: can i borrow your tardis and fix each ?
[15:26:56] <m_gol> it's much easier to argue against supporting new module libraries knowing ES6 is coming
[15:27:10] <timmywil> gnarf: please do :)
[15:27:20] <gnarf> or is that like a fixed point in time?
[15:27:40] <gnarf> "and each was broken"
[15:28:07] <gnarf> "the index was deemed to be first henceforce"
[15:29:50] <timmywil> perhaps in an alternate universe
[15:30:11] <gnarf> how many bytes would we save?
[15:33:22] <gnarf> hrm
[15:37:52] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: FWIW, I backed you in a comment at http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14664
[15:46:44] <m_gol> rwaldron: is tail call optimization still in scope for ES6?
[16:27:13] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks m_gol.
[16:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: I feel your pain.
[16:34:32] <DaveMethvin> oh boy
[16:34:44] <DaveMethvin> just trying to get my computer running again
[16:34:58] <DaveMethvin> but it's gonna be a while
[16:35:40] <DaveMethvin> markelog: do you think you'll get your changes landed soon?
[16:36:15] <markelog> they ready, you want me to land them?
[16:36:36] <DaveMethvin> i think timmywil took a look, right?
[16:36:42] <markelog> yep
[16:36:47] <DaveMethvin> ok that's good enough for me
[16:37:01] <DaveMethvin> i don't know if you saw but IE7 passed the last run
[16:37:08] <DaveMethvin> IE6 and IE8 still hang
[16:37:14] <DaveMethvin> so let's see how this one does 
[16:37:21] * DaveMethvin keeps fingers crossed
[16:37:42] <markelog> yeah, i saw it even spend so time figuring it out
[16:38:00] <markelog> one thing though
[16:38:02] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1485
[16:38:14] <markelog> IE6 only fix and try...catch in it
[16:38:19] <DaveMethvin> that's an ugly one
[16:38:26] <DaveMethvin> i rememeber having to deal with it
[16:38:35] <DaveMethvin> about 7 years ago :)
[16:39:04] <markelog> yeah we could do it without try...catch but in some cases we will hit other env
[16:39:24] <markelog> although modern browsers should not fill it
[16:40:05] <DaveMethvin> well let's make this our last IE6 fix, EVAR
[16:41:14] <markelog> all righty
[16:41:40] <DaveMethvin> ok i have to run but will be back later, i hope timmywil will reappear

[17:18:56] <markelog> hm, something wrong with jenkins.jquery.com
[18:11:52] <DaveMethvin> Looks like jenkins is broken?
[18:18:07] <s5fs> DaveMethvin: something broken?
[18:18:26] <s5fs> yeah ok, that doesn't look right
[18:18:51] <DaveMethvin> s5fs: is this another jq01 problem?
[18:19:25] <s5fs> probably related, yes
[18:19:37] <s5fs> well, possibly related, i'm digging into it now
[18:19:43] <DaveMethvin> k thanks!
[18:19:47] <s5fs> (its the last thing that changed, therefore it's suspect ;)
[18:28:35] <DaveMethvin> time for another reboot
[18:28:48] <doesallmagic2> Project QUnit build #360: SUCCESS in 4 min 10 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/QUnit/360/
[18:32:33] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin|away: Not related to jq03 and not broken fortunately, it seems Jenkins corrupted build history during the upgrade. So though everything is in tact (installed binaries, job configuration, grunt/npm/github hooks), but it doesn't show the "last build status" for most jobs as they haven't run since the upgrade. 
[18:32:41] <Krinkle> As commits come in for them, the data will populate again
[18:32:45] <Krinkle> QUnit is green again.
