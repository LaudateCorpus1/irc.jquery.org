[04:09:04] <m_gol> anyone here? I have a problem with callbacks in grunt
[06:07:15] <m_gol> ehh, this is such a mess
[06:19:21] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol opened pull request #1275: Fixes 13793. Corrects source map generation bugs. (06master...06sourcemap)  02http://git.io/TNPREw
[06:57:40] <m_gol> please test http://git.io/TNPREw :)
[07:09:03] <gibson042> m_gol: we need to preserve line count in the pre-uglify banner stripping too
[07:13:38] <m_gol> gibson042: what do you mean?
[07:14:03] <m_gol> I thought this short banner is only needed so that we can preserve it in minification
[07:14:16] <m_gol> but the minification strips leading newlines anyway
[07:14:23] <m_gol> so what's exactly wrong?
[07:15:38] <gibson042> you needed to add those "\n"s because the map was generated from a pre-min file that started with a one-line top banner and did *not* apply to the jquery.js file with a multi-line top banner
[07:16:10] <gibson042> but the pre-min file also differs from jquery.js in its lack of the embedded Sizzle banner, which is the exact same problem
[07:16:43] <m_gol> hah
[07:16:46] <m_gol> right
[07:16:46] <gibson042> https://github.com/mzgol/jquery/blob/cbe0b428180a935abe447ca55213e1762b072492/Gruntfile.js#L534
[07:16:52] <m_gol> that explains my problems
[07:17:17] <m_gol> k, will look into it
[07:22:47] <m_gol> gibson042: is it possible to do sth like that purely with regex replace?
[07:23:28] <gibson042> if the replacement is a function, you can just return the match minus all non-newline characters
[07:24:37] <m_gol> k, thx
[07:40:56] <m_gol> gibson042: pr updated, seems everything works correctly now!
[07:41:56] <gibson042> woohoo
[07:41:59] * gibson042 cheers
[07:57:33] <mvta> hi mates, good evening all
[07:58:15] <mvta> does anybody know why $('input:checked').length returns 0 for me in IE8 ?
[07:59:45] <mvta> the content was loaded by ajax and the checkbox are checked by default in the html
[08:00:14] <mvta> I'm working with 1.9.1 and migration 1.1.1
[08:01:10] <m_gol> mvta: support is in #jquery; if you find a bug, please provide a test case on jsfiddle.net and report a bug at bugs.jquery.com
[08:01:28] <mvta> m_gol, I think that is a bug
[08:02:01] <mvta> I will find in the tracker
[08:02:08] <m_gol> k, thx
[08:12:39] <mvta> m_gol, it works fine with http://jsbin.com/osaqub/1/edit#/osaqub/3/edit
[08:12:45] <mvta> in IE
[08:13:01] <mvta> but, how could I reproduce with ajax?
[08:13:19] <m_gol> mvta: let's go to #jquery with that
[08:13:27] <mvta> oki
[08:19:43] <snover> DaveMethvin: b-yo
[08:19:57] <snover> let me know when you are not in ‚Äòmeetings‚Äô
[08:23:06] <mvta> m_gol, http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12135 the last comment explains something
[08:25:00] <m_gol> mvta: can you report a bug, please?
[09:09:42] <JamesMGreene> Anyone know: does editing an existing annotated tag's message (in Git) change the date of the tag?
[09:10:07] <JamesMGreene> See my comment on this SO answer (for the same question): http://stackoverflow.com/a/7813236/471696
[09:18:50] <JamesMGreene> nm, tested it myself: yes, the date does change >_<
[09:19:34] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: can't it be forced to behave otherwise?
[09:19:45] <JamesMGreene> m_gol: Yeah but it's annoying :)
[09:19:46] <JamesMGreene> https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-tag.html#_on_backdating_tags
[09:20:04] <JamesMGreene> I was hoping there would just be a flag to set :(
[09:20:27] <JamesMGreene> Trouble is that changing the message doesn't actually replace the original tag, it just makes a new tag on top of the old tag
[09:20:47] <m_gol> uhh
[09:20:50] <JamesMGreene> (so if you do a `git show` on the tag, you will actually see both)
[09:21:27] <m_gol> git squash-tags ;D
[09:22:04] <JamesMGreene> lol, exactly :)

[12:38:11] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:39:02] <m_gol> I see Dave is away today
[12:39:29] <m_gol> I wonder where we're staying on jQuery 1.10
[12:58:27] <DaveMethvin> ?forget foo
[12:58:27] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[12:58:29] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, .off() | jQuery API Documentation - Remove an event handler. http://api.jquery.com/off/
[12:58:32] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: I can‚Äôt forget that which I do not know.
[12:58:43] <DaveMethvin> b-ot: read
[12:58:55] <DaveMethvin> damn b-ot you slow
[12:59:48] <m_gol> hi, Dave!
[13:00:00] <DaveMethvin> hey m_gol
[13:00:06] <m_gol> how are we staying on the release?
[13:00:29] <DaveMethvin> seems like nothing major has come up so it should be good to go?
[13:00:41] <m_gol> I fixed the source map problem with a little help from gibson042 :)
[13:00:47] <m_gol> lemme look
[13:00:57] <DaveMethvin> i may want to wait until Friday, which turns out the be the 5th anniversary of the release of jQuery 1.2.6
[13:01:04] <m_gol> nice :)
[13:02:28] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: what about this one? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13912
[13:02:39] <m_gol> (I'm looking at the agenda doc)
[13:02:53] <m_gol> and this: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13914
[13:03:09] <m_gol> other things are solved (well, the source map pr needs to be merged but that's all)
[13:04:41] <DaveMethvin> i  think that is a dup? we had two tickets related to activeElement
[13:05:47] <DaveMethvin> lemme search
[13:06:03] <m_gol> I remember mostly this one (about :focus selector) http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13378
[13:07:03] <DaveMethvin> ?13393
[13:07:05] <bot-t> [#13393]  (closed bug: fixed in v1.10) - http://jqbug.com/13393
[13:07:14] <DaveMethvin> ?13378
[13:07:16] <bot-t> [#13378]  ( click ""Allow blocked content"".) - http://jqbug.com/13378
[13:07:33] <DaveMethvin> but also #13393 
[13:07:36] <DaveMethvin> can you ask them to verify it's fixed on -git?
[13:07:49] <DaveMethvin> bout time you lazy-ass bot
[13:09:06] <m_gol> k, I asked
[13:09:46] <m_gol> so, there's one important left
[13:09:48] <m_gol> ?13914
[13:09:49] <bot-t> [#13914] revert change from #13752 - tabIndex propHook's default value for non-focusable elements should be -1 (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/13914
[13:12:46] <m_gol> what was the reason of this change?
[13:13:25] <DaveMethvin> see the ticket m_gol
[13:13:29] <DaveMethvin> i didn't follow it all but sounded like we broked someting :)
[13:14:01] <m_gol> well, the ticket only says: "TABINDEX PROPHOOK'S DEFAULT VALUE FOR NON-FOCUSABLE ELEMENTS SHOULD BE -1"
[13:14:05] <m_gol> without explanation
[13:54:07] <snover> DaveMethvin: b-ot doesn‚Äôt accept addressing like that
[13:54:12] <snover> if it says to use `read you have to use `read
[13:54:18] <snover> just like you have to use `tell instead of b-ot: tel
[13:54:19] <snover> l
[13:54:26] <snover> i hate everyone involved for that
