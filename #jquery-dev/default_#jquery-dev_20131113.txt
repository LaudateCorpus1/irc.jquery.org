[07:03:03] <DaveMethvin> well that escalated quickly rwaldron .. in a good way
[07:03:10] <rwaldron> I'm impressed

[11:20:09] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: is there anyway using jQuery position to provide coords for "within" instead of a selector?
[11:20:19] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:21:31] <mikesherov_> scott_gonzalez: if I added that functionality, what are the chances you'd let me land it?
[11:21:59] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it depends on how much complexity it adds. I'm assuming not too much.
[11:22:13] <mikesherov_> Yeah
[11:22:46] <mikesherov_> I have a use case where I want to collide with a div horizontally, and the window vertically, and I was thinking the easiest most generic way to get that
[11:23:02] <mikesherov_> would be to just provide coords
[11:23:39] <mikesherov_> the other thoughts were to be able to provide multiple elements for within, and getting the minimal rectangle there, but that just seemed like too much
[11:24:06] <mikesherov_> OK, so I'll add a ticket for that, please don't immediately close :-)

[13:28:20] <b-ot> jqcommit: Pull request #1433 by markelog (19s ago): Use grunt and bower packages as local dependencies
[13:47:46] <Krinkle> FYI: Running a debug build now in TestSwarm for jquery/jquery on mobile browsers: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1872
[13:48:28] <DaveMethvin> I'd grab popcorn Krinkle but I am sure this won't be pretty
[13:48:38] <DaveMethvin> although we do need IE11
[13:48:42] <markelog> wow
[13:48:49] <DaveMethvin> did they ever get it on BrowserStack?
[13:49:09] <Krinkle> I'm currently trying to figure out why Android 2.3 won't start.
[13:49:41] <DaveMethvin> like, not at all?
[13:52:18] <DaveMethvin> still are running preview IE11 on BS
[13:52:36] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/browserstack
[13:52:47] <Krinkle> 	22:51:55	spawn	{"version":"2.3","device":"Samsung Galaxy Note","os":"android"}	{"id":5542107}
[13:52:54] <Krinkle> 16/16 android2.3 workers lost
[13:53:38] <DaveMethvin> my splunk account is not there or i lost the pass, so i'll take your word for it
[13:55:58] <Krinkle> Seems to work when I try it manually
[13:56:10] <Krinkle> http://cl.ly/image/2f2L0s163j0B
[13:56:16] <Krinkle> maybe it is too slow?
[13:56:58] <DaveMethvin> you mean the connection is timing out maybe?
[13:59:22] <Krinkle> Ah, no. Looks like the ua-parser doesn't recognise it bi-directionally
[14:02:31] <m_gol> meh
[14:02:48] <m_gol> you'd think a service dedicated to testing browsers would keep those browsers up-to-date...
[14:03:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah i hate to be pushy but IE11 has been out for HOURS now (well days)
[14:04:21] <m_gol> almost a month
[14:04:23] <m_gol> on Windows 8.1
[14:04:35] <m_gol> 17.10.2013
[14:04:46] <m_gol> 7.11 on Win7
[14:05:01] <m_gol> 25 days or so should be enough...
[14:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> You'd think with the MS partnership, they'd get IE11 updated pretty quickly.
[14:06:48] <m_gol> Sauce Labs, OTH, doesn't have Opera newer than 12.x
[14:07:18] <m_gol> but they have Fx 25 & Chrome 31
[14:07:34] <m_gol> Chrome 31 is stable and Browser Stack still has only 29...
[14:07:45] <m_gol> ridiculous
[14:14:48] <Krinkle> m_gol: DaveMethvin: IE11 has been available on browserstack for several months
[14:14:58] <Krinkle> 11.0 Release Preview and 11.0 Desktop on Windows 8.1
[14:15:00] <m_gol> Krinkle: the preview
[14:15:06] <m_gol> ah
[14:15:07] <m_gol> ok
[14:15:23] <DaveMethvin> that desktop is a preview not the release
[14:15:42] <Krinkle> Also, Chrome 31 is on browserstack, but still labeled "dev" instead of stable.
[14:15:55] <Krinkle> ok, just saying, it is on there, but an outdated version.
[14:16:10] <m_gol> Krinkle: a dev version is not a stable version
[14:16:15] <m_gol> it can differ in significant ways
[14:16:19] <Krinkle> I know..
[14:16:19] <DaveMethvin> an outdated version isn't helping us either
[14:16:39] <DaveMethvin> so what you're saying Krinkle is that you're technically correct, the best kind of correct :)
[14:16:43] <m_gol> hm, but IE11 does seem to be available for Windows 8.1
[14:16:56] <m_gol> they have the preview and the "Desktop"
[14:16:56] <DaveMethvin> i'm running it now on my own system
[14:17:11] <DaveMethvin> ie11 for windows 7 final shipped last week too
[14:17:12] <m_gol> I mean on BrowserStack
[14:17:13] <Krinkle> No, I'm merely acknowledging that browserstack has thought of IE11 very early on but have forgotten to update it once the stable release came out.
[14:17:43] <DaveMethvin> and that brings us back to doe, a deer, a female deer ...
[14:17:52] <DaveMethvin> that was my point in the beginning at least
[14:17:54] <m_gol> ok, but we're testing on stable versions anyway so that doesn't help us
[14:18:52] <Krinkle> Fixed Android 2.3 http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1873
[14:19:06] <DaveMethvin> it used to be that IE changed very little once it was released, but since IE9 they have been doing a bunch of slipstream bug fixes on patch tuesdays
[14:19:10] <Krinkle> (well, it's up to you to "fix" fix it, but it's running now)
[14:19:19] <DaveMethvin> so it's become important to get those updates
[14:19:49] <m_gol> right
[14:20:07] <m_gol> especially that IE11 screams "I'm not IE!" in every direction so it matters a lot to test on it
[14:20:35] <DaveMethvin> attachEvent? What attachEvent? HE'S NOT HERE!
[14:22:27] <m_gol> well, that one is true at least
[14:22:37] <m_gol> IE11 doesn't have attachEvent for real
[14:23:12] <m_gol> but there's ActiveXObject, document.all etc.
[14:23:18] <DaveMethvin> right
[14:23:25] <timmywil> HAI
[14:23:35] <DaveMethvin> speaking of not here, he's here!
[14:23:50] <m_gol> they even made their DevTools sane to look less like IE!
[14:24:01] <DaveMethvin> i like the new UI Responsivenes view
[14:24:17] <timmywil> Soon we may hear phrases like "IE is the new IE"
[14:24:58] <timmywil> but I'm reserving judgement
[14:25:02] <m_gol> I actually wonder what out policy for IE will be in the near future
[14:25:03] <m_gol> for 2.x
[14:25:28] <m_gol> I guess we won't support IE9 until 2020 or sth ;)
[14:27:20] <DaveMethvin> there's always jQuery 3.0 with ES6 being the minimum
[14:27:21] <DaveMethvin> :)
[14:27:24] <m_gol> :)
[14:27:27] <m_gol> can't wait
[14:27:36] <DaveMethvin> well you're gonna have to wait
[14:27:39] <m_gol> hahaha
[14:27:40] <DaveMethvin> A LONG TIME
[14:27:57] <m_gol> I guess we won't support Android 2.3 on that one :P
[14:29:34] <m_gol> btw, if MS doesn't change their support policy they'll support 10 IE versions in 2020
[14:30:48] <DaveMethvin> ie6/7 dies next year doesn't it?
[14:30:54] <m_gol> only ie6
[14:31:00] <m_gol> ie7 is supported as long as Vista
[14:31:04] <m_gol> which is until 2017
[14:31:12] <DaveMethvin> oh right
[14:31:17] <m_gol> ie8 went out with win7 so it'll be 2020 :P
[14:31:19] <DaveMethvin> but who uses Vista?
[14:31:30] <m_gol> that's a valid question ;)
[14:31:38] <m_gol> but IE8 until 2020... imagine that
[14:31:45] <DaveMethvin> what ms supports and what we support are two different things
[14:31:52] <DaveMethvin> the ie8 one is really bad
[14:31:55] <m_gol> yeah
[14:31:59] <DaveMethvin> but then android 2.3 is bad too
[14:32:06] <DaveMethvin> they're still shipping it
[14:32:14] <m_gol> if they support it but only corps use it we don't have to care a lot
[14:32:25] <m_gol> I mean, as long as we don't have team members in China :P
[14:32:46] <DaveMethvin> last i looked it was like 22% ie6 in china
[14:33:08] <m_gol> btw, Google works to be able to update the WebView together with bundled Chrome (though not for 4.4), that'll be great
[14:33:14] <DaveMethvin> so sad http://www.modern.ie/en-us/ie6countdown
[14:33:18] <m_gol> now waiting for iOS to do the same (right...)
[14:33:51] <m_gol> iOS is not so bad because iOS users tend to update their phones more often
[14:33:53] <DaveMethvin> the good thing is that if apple is the only one NOT to do it then it becomes a competitive thing
[14:33:54] <m_gol> but still
[14:33:59] <m_gol> true
[14:34:23] <m_gol> hm
[14:34:38] <m_gol> StatCounter & Net Applications differ so much in their stats
[14:35:34] <DaveMethvin> the clicky.com ones are the most interesting to me
[14:35:48] <DaveMethvin> they show that people are only using ie 6/7/8 at work
[14:35:55] <m_gol> nice!
[14:36:17] <DaveMethvin> http://clicky.com/marketshare/global/web-browsers/internet-explorer/
[14:36:20] <m_gol> or on XP I guess ;)
[14:36:50] <m_gol> there are some nice jumps there!
[14:37:04] <DaveMethvin> ie8 is like half the markeshare on weekends
[14:37:33] <m_gol> once IE9 got auto-updated to IE10 the jumps for it increased a lot
[14:38:00] <m_gol> my current project has assumed support IE10+ ;)
[14:38:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and you can see ie11 start to creep in there too
[14:38:19] <m_gol> IE10 will die quicker than IE9 (because Vista)
[14:38:31] <DaveMethvin> notice how ie9 is starting to follow that same "only on weekdays" pattern
[14:38:58] <m_gol> yup, that's what I said above when I was speaking about "jumps" :)
[14:41:38] <m_gol> BrowserStack has iOS7 now
[14:41:52] <m_gol> we should get 5.1, 6 & 7 on TestSwarm
[14:42:31] <m_gol> there may be some failures but last time I checked there weren't a lot of them (Android 2.3 is a different story...)
[14:43:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[14:43:10] <DaveMethvin> might be time for some more skipped tests
[14:43:19] <m_gol> ;)
[14:43:26] <m_gol> I have an idea about Android 2.3 testing
[14:43:29] <DaveMethvin> not sure how important .position() is on 2.3
[14:43:31] <m_gol> SKIP ALL THE TESTS
[14:44:03] <DaveMethvin> normally this is the place where i'd lol but in this case,hmmm
[14:44:09] <m_gol> :D
[14:45:09] <m_gol> what do you mean?
[14:45:26] <DaveMethvin> well, skip MOST of the tests
[14:45:44] <DaveMethvin> in the case of .position() for example, how important is that for a tiny little screen?
[14:46:12] <DaveMethvin> is there some fallback that would allow basic functionality but not meet all the API guarantees?
[14:46:20] <DaveMethvin> that kind of things
[14:46:31] <m_gol> ok
[14:46:36] <m_gol> many more ifs in the tests
[14:46:57] <m_gol> anyway, now we don't even test on Android 4.sth, we should start from that
[14:47:13] <DaveMethvin> true
[14:47:27] <DaveMethvin> okay, gotta run for a while
[14:47:52] <m_gol> k, I'll go bathe in github.com/features glory ;)
