[08:24:02] <ralphholzmann> https://www.dropbox.com/account/bonus
[08:24:06] <ralphholzmann> Are you maxed yet?
[08:24:09] <ralphholzmann> (no rush, just checking)
[09:06:36] <joshmock> you guys probably get this a lot, but is there any intentional plan to have "official" versions of jQuery on npm?
[09:07:03] <joshmock> this readme gives me a little hope: https://github.com/coolaj86/node-jquery
[09:17:50] <ajpiano> i think we are working on it
[09:17:59] <ajpiano> timmywil i recall you chatting about it last week?
[09:18:28] <timmywil> yes, I just need to do some build adjustments
[09:18:37] <timmywil> It's on my list
[09:18:47] <timmywil> I might be able to get to it today
[09:19:07] <timmywil> if I can get a testswarm installation going
[09:19:30] <joshmock> nice!
[09:19:42] <joshmock> is the plan to put several versions on there, or just 2.* and onward?
[09:20:42] <timmywil> joshmock: just 2.x current+
[09:20:48] <joshmock> gotcha
[09:21:59] <joshmock> I suppose given it's v8 there's not really any need for 1.9
[16:09:30] <Krinkle> gseguin|away: That third parameter (nickname) is redundant if you `/cs op #channel` yourself :)
[16:14:34] <eddiemonge> Krinkle: nice
[20:38:51] <JamesMGreene> So I got this lovely T-shirt and notebook in the mail today from Media Temple
[20:39:09] <JamesMGreene> And all I could think was "Oh man, John Bender is going to be so excited about his notebook!"
[20:40:53] <JamesMGreene> RWhitbeck and kswedberg know what I'm talking about :)
[20:46:21] <JamesMGreene> and JasonDScott___
