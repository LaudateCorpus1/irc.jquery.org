[09:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Every time I look at the GSoC ideas list, I wonder why the mentors don't have their GitHub username listed.
[09:05:42] <arschmitz> we shoudl and IRC too since thats where we ask them to go
[09:32:09] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: that is a good point, for some reason I never thought about that. Could've mentioned that a few weeks ago :-)
[09:33:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, probably should have said something the first time I noticed it :-/
[09:42:16] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: oh well, I've added them now
[09:54:36] <fcarstens> jzaefferer: ping
[09:54:52] <jzaefferer> fcarstens: pong
[09:55:13] <fcarstens> I'm currently writing my proposal for the reporter interface project. I was wondering why you mentioned TAP and JUnit XML in https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/531 Isn't that a reporter output and not a reporter interface?
[09:55:25] <fcarstens> Or do you just mean that we need a standardized (JSON) data format for the events?
[09:57:46] <jzaefferer> fcarstens: well, the bullet list there outlines two separate, but related aspects. TAP and JUnit XML represent data consumable by a reporter. The other one is about the interface outputting that data
[09:58:23] <jzaefferer> the jsreporter project JamesMGreene started is about the latter, which by itself seems to be a decent challenge enough
[10:00:06] <jzaefferer> fcarstens: does that answer your question?
[10:00:40] <fcarstens> As I understand it, a reporter would consume JSON from the testframework and maybe output TAP. But in which scenario would a reporter consume TAP?
[10:01:40] <jzaefferer> fcarstens: let me try to describe a few scenarios, I'll add that to the issue
[10:01:52] <fcarstens> I mean, QUnit outputs JSON, not TAP :)
[10:02:04] <fcarstens> OK, thanks :)
[10:10:17] <jzaefferer> fcarstens: this might answer your question: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/531#issuecomment-85601755
[10:11:02] <jzaefferer> (tiny update)
[10:17:14] <mavihs> is this channel logged?
[10:18:33] <mavihs> I was wondering why there is no mailing list for QUnit. Whatever discussion takes place on channel, vanishes after some time. 
[10:18:41] <jzaefferer> mavihs: yes, for some reason the topic is missing this link: http://irc.jquery.org/
[10:18:56] <mavihs> jzaefferer: thanks
[10:19:14] <jzaefferer> mavihs: yes, that's okay, we use GitHub issues and PRs as a more permanent discussion channel
[10:21:12] <mavihs> jzaefferer: yeah, but I would really appreciate if minutes of IRC meetings are posted somewhere.
[10:21:53] <jzaefferer> mavihs: those are on http://meetings.jquery.org/
[10:22:10] <jzaefferer> mavihs: for QUnit http://meetings.jquery.org/category/testing/
[10:22:36] <mavihs> jzaefferer: wow, that looks great. Thanks :)
[10:23:43] <mavihs> It has a calander also, would love to take part in future meetings as well :)
[10:26:52] <fcarstens> jzeaferrerer: replied there.
[10:36:13] <jzaefferer> fcarstens: I'll be away for the rest of the day, but should be around most of the time in the next days if you have further questions. The sooner you submit your proposal, the more to review and improve; deadline is looming (Friday!)
[10:37:03] <fcarstens> I aim for tonight ;)
[10:41:54] <jzaefferer> cool, I'll check it out tomorrow morning then
[11:24:12] <bepolite>  Please what are some great issues here https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues for beginners?

[23:40:02] <ugoub> I think this expression feels right but works wrong. $(':not(.DatatTable .DataRow)',$('[id=theDataTableWithADataTableInside].DataTable'));
