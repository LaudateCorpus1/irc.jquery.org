[09:59:23] <jqcommit> [testswarm-browserstack/2012-rewrite] WIP - Rewrite - Timo Tijhof
[10:40:20] <ninjanlu> hello guys
[10:40:55] <ninjanlu> jquery plugin website is still down right?
[10:41:39] <ninjanlu> i made a design prototype of a new jquery plugin website pretty cool and fast www.gianlucaguarini.com/blog/jquery-plugins-website-redesign-proposal/
[11:04:42] <jaubourg> hi there
[11:05:43] <jaubourg> rworth: you guys booked from Saturday to Wednesday then?
[11:06:30] <jaubourg> today is news day: first I'm made co-editor of the XHR spec then I'm invited to jQuery Asia \o/
[11:20:18] <rworth> yeah
[11:20:29] <rworth> that's awesome :)
[11:25:35] <jaubourg> =)
[11:29:40] <ryanneuf_> that should be fun
[11:30:02] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking forward to the summit
[11:30:39] <jaubourg> same here
[12:19:20] <ryanneufeld> it seems push perms was just added to some people... it's comming!
[12:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> ninjanlu: There's a much more feature complete site that will be launching soon.
[12:53:11] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yt?
[12:53:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:53:38] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov:
[12:53:40] <mikesherov> hi
[12:54:04] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12462
[12:54:50] <DaveMethvin> oh the animating text node one?
[12:55:08] <mikesherov> so, the last blocker I have for the fix is that .data doesn't work on IE7/6, I was wondering if after another bit of debugging you minded if I closed this as won't fix?
[12:55:38] <DaveMethvin> well before it must have just ignored text nodes i guess
[12:56:01] <mikesherov> .
[12:56:11] <DaveMethvin> welcome back mikesherov
[12:56:13] <DaveMethvin> :D
[12:56:46] <DaveMethvin> i think we can close it as wontfix
[12:56:52] <mikesherov> OK
[12:57:10] <mikesherov> I mean, it's related to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3925
[12:57:49] <DaveMethvin> right, we can't save data on text nodes there so we can't animate them
[12:57:55] <DaveMethvin> all we could do is ignore them in the set
[13:01:09] <mikesherov> right, but worked in 1.7.2
[13:01:12] <mikesherov> weirdly enough
[13:01:22] <mikesherov> ok, I might wontfix if I can't get a solution shortly
[13:07:16] <ninjanlu> hello there
[13:10:54] <ninjanlu> is there someone agree with me that jquery plugin website needs a restyle?
[13:14:45] <rworth> ninjanlu it's being worked on
[13:15:02] <rworth> in fact, it will be a big focus of the Developer Summit event we've got coming up in just a couple of weeks
[13:15:10] <ninjanlu> http://www.gianlucaguarini.com/blog/jquery-plugins-website-redesign-proposal/
[13:15:15] <ninjanlu> i made this draft
[13:15:28] <ninjanlu> and currently I am working on it just for fun
[13:16:15] <rworth> sorry, I thought you were talking about jquery.com. The plugins site has been rebuilt and restyled, will be launching in a couple weeks.
[13:17:15] <ninjanlu> are you sure?
[13:18:03] <rworth> I'm one of the folks that's been working on it for the last 10 months, so I'm pretty sure :)
[13:18:14] <ninjanlu> ahah sorry
[13:18:18] <rworth> np
[13:19:04] <ninjanlu> is there any chance to that you could consider my prototype?
[13:19:57] <rworth> the new design of the plugins site is part of a redesign of all 30+ jquery sites that has been in progress for over 3 years
[13:21:04] <ninjanlu> ok so I think I will make it just for fun as a side project
[13:23:36] <ninjanlu> are you working also on an API to get the plugins info directly from your official website?
[13:36:28] <ninjanlu> so in two weeks we could finally download and search plugins from an official jquery plugins website.. what a great news
[13:37:04] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: are you that guy
[13:37:10] <ajpiano> who made that proposal
[13:37:16] <ninjanlu> yea
[13:37:18] <ajpiano> awesome
[13:37:20] <ajpiano> it looks great :)
[13:37:28] <ninjanlu> thanks i am working on it
[13:37:37] <ajpiano> rworth explained above how it's part of a big rollout of a lot of other things
[13:37:41] <ajpiano> so it's taken longer than we've expected
[13:37:49] <ninjanlu> but it seems that they are already working on it
[13:37:58] <ajpiano> but it's still awesome the effort you put in
[13:38:13] <ryanneufeld> ninjanlu: dude, that's sessy
[13:38:33] <ninjanlu> yeah maybe i will release this as an unofficial website
[13:38:52] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: have you coded up the interaction or just the designs
[13:38:55] <ninjanlu> but anyway i think that a jquery plugin search engine could becool
[13:39:04] <ajpiano> the idea of lilke a thing like github's launch bar is cool
[13:39:06] <ninjanlu> both
[13:39:15] <ajpiano> have you seen https://github.com/launch
[13:39:43] <ninjanlu> yea i would like to login users with their github account
[13:40:22] <ninjanlu> cool but I am full of all these shitty websites
[13:40:36] <ninjanlu> man we are almost in 2013
[13:41:09] <ninjanlu> so i think we need something cooler to push our plugins
[13:41:38] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com
[13:41:46] <mikesherov> make it cooler!
[13:41:58] <ninjanlu> ahah
[13:42:00] <ninjanlu> i will
[13:42:04] <ninjanlu> i promise
[13:42:21] <ninjanlu> backend laravel + frontend backbone and requirejs
[13:43:35] <mikesherov> .
[13:44:03] <ryanneufeld> ninjanlu: it needs to be, at least 20% cooler
[13:44:20] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: i think we could incorporate some of the ideas from your mockup in
[13:44:39] <ninjanlu> it would be great
[13:44:52] <ninjanlu> i will be proud for this
[13:45:50] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: http://stage.plugins.jquery.com
[13:46:23] <ninjanlu> oh man! wtf is this?!
[13:46:42] <ninjanlu> it seems coming from a joomla template!
[13:46:55] <ajpiano> it's the staging site
[13:47:29] <ninjanlu> I am sorry if i am rude
[13:47:46] <ninjanlu> but do we really need all those info?
[13:48:16] <ajpiano> what info?
[13:48:48] <ninjanlu> on the entire website you have:
[13:48:58] <ninjanlu> 1 the list of the new plugins
[13:49:07] <ninjanlu> 2 recent updates
[13:49:18] <ninjanlu> 3 popular tags
[13:49:27] <ninjanlu> 4 toolbar on the top
[13:49:38] <ninjanlu> 5 footer
[13:49:52] <ninjanlu> and call to action to search something
[13:50:10] <ninjanlu> ehy I want just search a plugin
[13:50:19] <ajpiano> i'm trying to understand how this is not that
[13:50:21] <ninjanlu> i don't need all this noise
[13:50:30] <ajpiano> if you're talking about the size of that one main thing in the middle
[13:50:33] <ajpiano> yes it's rather large
[13:50:36] <ajpiano> that's why this is the staging site
[13:50:44] <ninjanlu> I mean
[13:51:36] <ninjanlu> there are many unofficial websites showing the last plugins
[13:51:59] <ajpiano> what do you mean, "the last plugins?"
[13:52:04] <ninjanlu> i would like to see something original coming from the official jquery plugin
[13:52:17] <ninjanlu> sorry i meant the latest
[13:52:32] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: we are starting an official plugin registry
[13:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> ninjanlu: You want something new, but so far you've said you want nothing but search.
[13:52:41] <ninjanlu> i can imagine a kinf of search engine..
[13:52:44] <ajpiano> the website is jsut part of the whole system we've had to build
[13:53:21] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: i think it would be very possible to integrate some of your ideas for an awesome search bar right into the middle of the front page
[13:53:31] <ajpiano> instead of it just being a textbox that you press enter in
[13:54:18] <ninjanlu> what about the rating stars?
[13:54:41] <ajpiano> right now we're going with the github activity as a metric
[13:55:21] <ninjanlu> so nothing stored by you..
[13:56:07] <ajpiano> i mean, we store the info, but we aren't doing our own rating system right now
[13:56:19] <ninjanlu> ok ok
[13:56:49] <ninjanlu> so this website will be released in two weeks?! right?
[13:57:14] <ajpiano> you may be right
[13:57:20] <ajpiano> or not :)
[13:57:43] <ajpiano> there's an event in two weeks where we'll be trying to do a lot of work in it
[13:57:46] <ninjanlu> ok I gave you my idea
[13:58:18] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: i mean, you could try to code it and participate in the process if you want
[13:58:19] <ninjanlu> I could tell you that I am working on it with another backend developer
[13:58:28] <ajpiano> the entire plugins site is open source
[13:58:41] <ninjanlu> ok than maybe before publish it
[13:58:58] <ninjanlu> i could send you the prototype
[13:59:15] <ninjanlu> and if you like it we could host it on an official domain
[13:59:18] <ajpiano> do you guys have your own database of plugins?
[13:59:34] <scott_gonzalez> ninjanlu: We absolutely will not start from a new prototype. If you want to help, work on the existing code.
[13:59:46] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: i think we'd need a more holistic involvement
[13:59:46] <ajpiano> yeah
[14:00:02] <ajpiano> like, we aren't just gonna have different-plugin-search.juery.com
[14:00:14] <ajpiano> but at the same time we appreciate the work you have done
[14:00:14] <ninjanlu> my prototype will be a completely working website
[14:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> ninjanlu: We already have the new official plugins site.
[14:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> You can help with it or not.
[14:00:34] <ninjanlu> than it is your choice if publish it as a jquery satellite or not
[14:00:38] <ajpiano> where are you storing that plugin data
[14:00:44] <scott_gonzalez> We will not publish any "satellite" sites.
[14:01:04] <ninjanlu> ok that is clear now
[14:01:29] <ninjanlu> i will store the plugins on an our db
[14:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> That's silly.
[14:01:52] <scott_gonzalez> Pull data from us.
[14:01:56] <ajpiano> you're just going to enter them in there yourself?
[14:01:57] <ajpiano> ^^
[14:02:06] <ninjanlu> naa
[14:02:39] <ninjanlu> we are thinking about a json file to host on github
[14:02:51] <ajpiano> so you're going to do exactly what we are doing already
[14:02:55] <ninjanlu> and to fork whether there is a new plugin
[14:02:57] <ninjanlu> right
[14:03:16] <ninjanlu> but i did't know if steal your data is legal :)
[14:03:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's the entire purpose of the site.
[14:03:47] <ninjanlu> ok that s great
[14:04:03] <ajpiano> it wouldn't really make sense for you to define your own alternate entire infrastructure for how jquery plugins shouldbe registered etc
[14:04:12] <ajpiano> right as this one is being finalised
[14:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> ninjanlu: See https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/3#issuecomment-3082282
[14:04:23] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3 on plugins.jquery.com (micmath; 9m, 2w ago): Integration with (AMD) Package Manager
[14:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> We never got any response.
[14:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to put together a proposal for an API.
[14:05:01] <ajpiano> but if you want to build a super hot front end and host it yourself, you can do that
[14:05:07] <ninjanlu> my AMD implementation is on my website itself
[14:05:17] <ninjanlu> to make it completely in ajax
[14:05:17] <ajpiano> but on the other hand it would be nice to have your involvement in the official site if you want to help
[14:05:17] <scott_gonzalez> I don't care about AMD.
[14:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> Read the comment I linked to.
[14:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> The plugins site is the official front-end to the list of plugins.
[14:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> In order to build that, we'll have lots of data around plugins.
[14:06:41] <ninjanlu> wow what a great news
[14:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> We can serve that data in other ways.
[14:07:08] <scott_gonzalez> That isn't a priority item for us until someone wants to actually use it.
[14:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> So we're waiting for someone to tell us what they want.
[14:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> So far nobody has.
[14:07:29] <ninjanlu> yes this is really helpful for us
[14:09:35] <ninjanlu> Ok so maybe i could answer to this issue to specify what kind of data you could provide with your open API
[14:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> Please file a new issue.
[14:10:06] <ninjanlu> ok
[14:10:22] <ninjanlu> but what about the crossdomain requests?
[14:11:57] <ninjanlu> XMLHttpRequest2?
[14:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> JSONP
[14:13:36] <ninjanlu> ok
[14:14:04] <ninjanlu> I will prepare a draft of open json plugins API
[14:15:39] <ninjanlu> but honestly I think to develop my prototype as a side project because my concept is completely different from yours
[14:16:56] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: i don't really think it's that different
[14:17:04] <ajpiano> that's why i pointed out the github.com/launch
[14:17:27] <ajpiano> the functionality of this autocomplete could either be included in the existing search box
[14:17:33] <ajpiano> or done as a separate thing like github has
[14:17:56] <ajpiano> otherwise, it's just down to design decisions and the front-end tech choies
[14:18:05] <ninjanlu> right
[14:18:54] <ninjanlu> de gustibus non disputandum est http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_gustibus_non_est_disputandum :)
[14:19:16] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: well put :)
[14:19:56] <ninjanlu> btw thanks for the tips
[14:20:18] <ajpiano> :)
[14:20:19] <ninjanlu> as soon as possible i will submit a new issue
[14:20:57] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: you should be aware that using the jquery logo like that  might not be totally kosher
[14:21:01] <ajpiano> which is something to keep in mind
[14:22:06] <ninjanlu> is it allowed or not? :)
[14:22:58] <ajpiano> as long as it is completley unaltered it can be ok, but you'd still have to disclaim that it wasn't associated with the jQuery Foundation, etc
[14:23:36] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: ping
[14:24:13] <ninjanlu> ok otherwise I am forced to make another one even better ;p
[14:25:11] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: that's also an option
[14:26:11] <ninjanlu> we will see...
[14:26:36] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: so i'm just sort of curious if you don't mind explaining why you want to go it alone
[14:27:20] <ninjanlu> jQuery is the best library on this planet
[14:27:33] <ajpiano> i don't want to tell you what to do or discourage you from it, i just want to get insight into what makes people make these decision
[14:27:45] <ninjanlu> it has millions plugins
[14:28:07] <ajpiano> indeed
[14:28:30] <ninjanlu> but when i arrive on a site like this http://www.jqueryplugins.com/
[14:28:50] <ninjanlu> to check something new..
[14:28:59] <ajpiano> agreed
[14:29:17] <ninjanlu> I really want to turn off my mac
[14:29:24] <ajpiano> but now that we are telling you that we are actually pretty close to completion, what makes you not want to get involved in incorporating your ideas into that process
[14:29:35] <ajpiano> and prefer to complete the thing you've built
[14:29:46] <ninjanlu> yes but again
[14:29:52] <ninjanlu> your website design
[14:30:04] <ninjanlu> (with all the respect for the designers)
[14:30:16] <ninjanlu> seems to be an old joomla template
[14:30:32] <ninjanlu> code matters but also design
[14:30:48] <ajpiano> so does it being part of jquery.com
[14:31:00] <ajpiano> but that's fine
[14:31:00] <ninjanlu> wait
[14:31:18] <ajpiano> i just wanted to understand your perspective
[14:31:19] <ninjanlu> do you think that jquery website is right ?
[14:31:38] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: i'm saying that you could get involved in the process of how the site ends up coming along
[14:31:50] <ninjanlu> too late :P
[14:31:59] <ajpiano> alright
[14:32:04] <ninjanlu> you are a developer like me
[14:32:06] <ninjanlu> so
[14:32:11] <ninjanlu> you need a plugin
[14:32:37] <ninjanlu> what would you like to do googling it or searching on a jquery plugins website?
[14:32:42] <ninjanlu> honestly!
[14:32:56] <ajpiano> on "a jquery plugins website?"
[14:33:13] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: right now we realise it's problematic how the ecosystem is
[14:33:25] <ninjanlu> yes
[14:33:29] <ajpiano> and we're finally about to take a big step to remedy that
[14:33:47] <ajpiano> and if you don't want to be involved in that because of either the design or because it took us too long or whateve
[14:33:52] <ninjanlu> jQuery system is too big and too much involved many stuff
[14:33:59] <ajpiano> it's important for me to know what makes people contribute or not
[14:34:12] <ninjanlu> man i need just a plugin nothing else
[14:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> ninjanlu: Is it fair to say you want extremely minimilasitc or nothing at all?
[14:34:38] <ninjanlu> yes
[14:34:44] <ninjanlu> but official
[14:34:53] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: i don't understand what would be wrong with plugins.jquery.com/lite
[14:34:55] <ninjanlu> not on github..
[14:35:03] <ajpiano> some kind of interface likle this,
[14:35:06] <ajpiano> that used the right colours
[14:35:09] <ajpiano> but was your interaction
[14:35:16] <ajpiano> and then linked to the same result pages
[14:35:20] <ninjanlu> that's different
[14:35:32] <ninjanlu> and closer to my idea
[14:35:38] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: that's what i'm trying to say
[14:35:46] <ajpiano> don't just say, "no your guys design sucks"
[14:35:51] <ninjanlu> ahah
[14:36:00] <ajpiano> let's talk and figure out if there's something that can make every body happy
[14:36:07] <ninjanlu> but i said in the beginning i give you the work
[14:36:15] <ninjanlu> and you need just to publish it..
[14:36:27] <ajpiano> that's not how open source works
[14:36:29] <scott_gonzalez> ninjanlu: That's not at all how we operate.
[14:36:50] <ninjanlu> ok that sounds good
[14:36:57] <ajpiano> for better or worse, projects have infrastructure
[14:36:58] <ninjanlu> :)
[14:37:09] <ninjanlu> yes but i am employed
[14:37:11] <ajpiano> you can't just go to mozilla and be like, here's a new better browser, please call it firefox
[14:37:20] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: ok?
[14:37:21] <ninjanlu> haha
[14:37:27] <ninjanlu> right i know
[14:37:40] <ajpiano> we are all employed (i hope)
[14:38:05] <ninjanlu> ah ok so you are not working just for jquery?!
[14:38:19] <ajpiano> correct
[14:38:20] <ninjanlu> even if it is opensource..
[14:38:34] <ninjanlu> even because*
[14:38:44] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: did you do this prototype on your own, or as part of your job
[14:38:54] <scott_gonzalez> ninjanlu: jQuery is primarily a volunteer project.
[14:38:56] <ninjanlu> no it is completely mine
[14:39:13] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: so there you go, it's just a matter of what people want to do in the time they can make available
[14:39:14] <ninjanlu> i am fighting agains yeoman
[14:39:33] <ajpiano> if you want to work on projects alone because it's fun or you want to get better or you want to make something great, that's one thing
[14:39:55] <ninjanlu> but?
[14:39:59] <ajpiano> no but
[14:40:10] <ajpiano> just that it's also a thing that people do to work on a big open source project
[14:40:18] <ninjanlu> if i would make it available for you...
[14:40:28] <ajpiano> even if it isn't as agile or like as immediately gratifiying as jsut building something yourself and shipping it
[14:40:31] <ninjanlu> what is needed?
[14:40:51] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: we have spent almost a year now unifying our entire website deploy etc
[14:40:54] <ajpiano> we can't just "take a website"
[14:41:06] <ninjanlu> ok right
[14:41:20] <ninjanlu> but the jquery lint could be a good idea
[14:41:40] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: that's what i'm saying.  i think at the core, the basic richer autocomplete search is a good thing
[14:41:50] <ajpiano> i have to get going
[14:42:00] <ajpiano> the point is, all the jquery sites and infrastructure are pretty much open source now
[14:42:22] <ajpiano> so if working on that autocomplete and exploring where it could maybe go, we could help to get you started
[14:42:30] <ninjanlu> ok
[14:42:32] <ajpiano> if you want to keep on doing your own thing, you can also :)
[14:42:37] <ninjanlu> that s grat
[14:42:47] <ninjanlu> great*
[14:43:07] <ninjanlu> can I update you about that through email?
[14:43:17] <ajpiano> sure, adam.sontag@jquery.com
[14:44:08] <ninjanlu> let me think about that and maybe than i could receive all the assets that i need to start working on it
[14:44:23] <ninjanlu> then*
[14:44:35] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com
[14:44:41] <ajpiano> there are the assets :D
[14:44:52] <ninjanlu> color palette..
[14:45:01] <ninjanlu> ui?
[14:45:16] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: you're right i can't just hadn you that and start going
[14:45:34] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: the best thing to do is to first try to get the basic site running locally, and we can help you with that
[14:46:04] <ninjanlu> ok you will receive my email
[14:46:27] <ajpiano> sounds good, you can also go to #jquery-infrastructure
[14:46:54] <ninjanlu> maybe you can start talking with the other folks to check whether my idea could be useful
[14:47:14] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: the best thing to do there is to start a github issue
[14:47:16] <ajpiano> on the plugins site
[14:47:24] <ajpiano> so we can start the discusssion
[14:47:50] <ninjanlu> is there on #jquery-infrastructure someone still alive? or they are already sleeping!
[14:48:22] <ajpiano> it's a pretty small channel, it looks like folks are having a discussion about soemthing completley unrelated
[14:48:41] <ajpiano> ninjanlu: #jqueryui-dev is also a place where some of the things where plugins get talked about a lot
[14:48:52] <ajpiano> but for Big Ideas™, github issues is the best
[14:49:22] <ninjanlu> ahaha thanks
[14:50:08] <ninjanlu> i am going to go
[14:50:27] <ninjanlu> nice talk and thanks for the tips
[14:50:31] <ajpiano> ok, me too
[14:50:40] <ajpiano> thanks for your like, massive initial effort
[14:50:46] <ajpiano> and your enthusiasm
[14:50:54] <ninjanlu> keep rokin
[14:50:59] <ajpiano> have a good weekend
[14:51:15] <ajpiano> bam
[14:52:53] <ajpiano> lol scott_gonzalez already made the issue 44 minutes ago
[18:50:28] <Krinkle> clarkbox: Would you like to give me rights on clarkbox/testswarm-browserstack?
[18:50:41] <Krinkle> (or maybe we can do the move now - if all involved parties are available)
[19:07:34] <jqcommit> [testswarm-browserstack] Krinkle force-pushed 2012-rewrite from 49d3c1f to f0b5227: http://git.io/P5HWkg
[19:07:34] <jqcommit> [testswarm-browserstack/2012-rewrite] WIP - Major rewrite (version 0.2.0) - Timo Tijhof
[19:13:12] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: I assume you know this, but the browserstack module already supports the v2 API
[19:13:20] <Krinkle> Yes I know
[19:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> Just FYI
[19:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I figured you did :-)
[19:27:12] <clarkbox> will do krinkle
[19:33:06] <Krinkle> clarkbox: when you do expect we'll move the repo? Maybe set up an IRC service hook for now.
[19:33:32] <Krinkle> https://github.com/Krinkle/testswarm-browserstack/admin/hooks#irc irc.freenode.net 6667 #jquery-dev jqcommit
[19:33:34] <clarkbox> I'm just going to keep it where it is. not worth moving.
[19:33:39] <Krinkle> (well for /clarkbox)
[19:33:46] <Krinkle> ok
[19:34:19] <clarkbox> ill add IRC hook
[19:34:57] <clarkbox> this is pretty comprehensive rewrite. nice work
[19:35:45] <Krinkle> pushed it, switching clone on swarm server back to your repo
[19:39:51] <Krinkle> Does anybody recognize this? I just got myself a declious big egg biscuits, then I got distracted for a big and now my hand is reaching in air. I already ate it!
[19:39:58] <Krinkle> bit*
[19:40:36] <Krinkle> I guess I just ate it on auto-pilot :P
[19:46:47] <scott_gonzalez> Late Friday night is the best time to do a release right? :-P http://blog.jqueryui.com/2012/09/jquery-ui-1-8-24/
[19:47:29] <scott_gonzalez> This release process is so painful.
[19:47:35] <scott_gonzalez> Still getting the site updated.
[19:48:32] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: the people who said "release early release often" clearly didn't have a release process that involved regression testing, blog posts, updating sites, notifying CDNs, etc, etc
[19:49:30] <scott_gonzalez> clearly
[19:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> Well, "release early" implies none of that stuff, right?
[19:50:33] <DaveMethvin> haha, right, maybe they really meant "aw fuck it just release"
[19:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> I have high hopes that the release process will be a LOT better with 1.9.x.
[19:50:52] <scott_gonzalez> That's very possible.
[19:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> There's so much SVN in this release process :-(
[19:52:16] <DaveMethvin> well there's your problem right there
[19:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that all goes away with 1.9.0 though :-)
[19:53:14] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, now it's time for me to SSH into multiple production servers and run some scripts...
[19:59:57] <scott_gonzalez> WHEW! All done.
[20:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> Looking forward to selling my MBP now.
[20:13:22] <Krinkle> Alrighty, new tsbs is running now
[20:13:36] <Krinkle> lets make sure it works
[20:18:18] <Krinkle> looks like grunt.js emits: path.existsSync is now called `fs.existsSync`.
