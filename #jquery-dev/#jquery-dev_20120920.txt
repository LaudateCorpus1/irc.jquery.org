[03:42:59] <pharotek> anyone here using linux? it's just taken me 3 hours to work out why the .addClass was malfunctioning. In a completely unrelated .js file there was a }) missing. I could use a new tool for writing in which could identify that for me my current editor seems underpowered in that respect
[04:33:33] <jaubourg> hi there
[05:03:10] <gibson042> .
[05:05:41] <jaubourg> ..
[07:01:22] <callumacrae> First ever jQuery patch coming soon… xD
[07:07:51] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: The @TravelRepublic site uses jQuery Mobile and adds a UI date picker, custom spinner, dual sliders - http://t.co/0aPE1Q8S ★ http://bit.ly/Uh96qI
[07:08:43] <callumacrae> Maybe not
[07:08:48] <callumacrae> Is GitHub having problems?
[07:08:51] <Dr4g> nice  stars :)
[07:10:47] <DaveMethvin> callumacrae: not that I know of
[07:10:51] <DaveMethvin> what's happening?
[07:11:06] <callumacrae> https://github.com/callumacrae/jquery
[07:11:15] <callumacrae> That should be up to date (and there should be a "contributing" branch)
[07:11:23] <callumacrae> According to git
[07:11:44] <callumacrae> Don't worry, the branch is only called contributing because it changes contributing.md :-)
[07:16:15] <callumacrae> Meh, probably job queue problems again
[07:16:28] <callumacrae> Oh, it's updated now anyway
[07:17:16] <DaveMethvin> ah ok
[07:17:21] <DaveMethvin> sometimes there's a bit of a delay
[07:17:35] <callumacrae> It was a good 20 minutes, though xD
[07:17:42] <DaveMethvin> oh that's more than a bit :D
[07:17:52] <callumacrae> Anyway, PR is sent now
[07:17:57] <DaveMethvin> k thanks!
[07:18:39] <callumacrae> Only documentation changes at the moment, I'll send a real PR later with some actual useful stuff in
[07:28:00] <callumacrae> zsh: correct 'grunt' to 'grn' [nyae]? n
[07:28:06] <callumacrae> zsh makes me want to kill myself

[09:08:43] <timmywil> ?tell gibson042 we have a major slowdown in nth-child selectors. See the perf suite.
[09:08:43] <b-ot> timmywil, I’ll tell gibson042 about that.
[09:10:02] <gibson042> timmywil as of the past 24 hours, or farther back?
[09:10:02] <b-ot> gibson042, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[09:10:09] <gibson042> b-ot: read
[09:10:09] <b-ot> gibson042, from timmywil, 1m 25s ago: we have a major slowdown in nth-child selectors. See the perf suite.
[09:10:20] <timmywil> gibson042: not sure, just checked
[09:10:50] <timmywil> gibson042: 1.8.1 was the fastest at that, but it dropped to ops below 1000
[09:11:23] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: ping
[09:11:50] <ajpiano> hey scott_gonzalez i am at the computer but i am actually not "in" today
[09:12:04] <timmywil> actually below 200
[09:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Just wondering if you want to use ajpiano.com or gmail.com address for Basecamp.
[09:12:15] <ajpiano> adam.sontag@jquery.com
[09:12:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:12:20] <ajpiano> thx
[09:12:33] <gibson042> timmywil: I'm guessing from https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/commit/1656af71d83ea1bf1861d646cc01d18a1d80d839
[09:12:34] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on sizzle by Timmy Willison (1d, 9m ago): Harden position caching against DOM manipulation for child selectors. Fixes jQuery bug #12337. Closes gh-153.
[09:12:45] <timmywil> gibson042: yea probably
[09:14:01] <timmywil> maybe it was so much faster because it was caching too much. other engines aren't exactly fast at it, but it's pretty slow
[09:16:56] <gibson042> timmywil: looking at the return line again, I think we should go back to `first === 0 ? diff === 0 : ...`
[09:17:13] <gibson042> because first === 0 is going to dominate the use of nth-child
[09:17:23] <timmywil> ok, I'll try it
[09:17:27] <gibson042> oh, n/m
[09:17:35] <gibson042> anything % 0 is NaN anyway
[09:18:28] <timmywil> yea, I don't think that didn't make a difference
[09:20:13] <gibson042> maybe we should just drop the caching there entirely, now that it can't be used for subsequent calls to Sizzle
[09:20:17] <timmywil> I understand we need to harden caching for DOM manip, but the caching has become less useful
[09:20:20] <timmywil> hehe
[09:20:50] <timmywil> let's see if we get a speedup dropping it
[09:21:50] <gibson042> the other problem is that we require forward iteration, so element 0 is going to have sizset defined O(n) times
[09:22:54] <gibson042> the more I look at this, the more I favor dropping this cache logic entirely
[09:31:46] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #385: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/385/
[09:31:46] <doesallmagic> timmywillisn: Sizzle: account for external document contexts (such as iframes) in combinator checks. Fixes #12572.
[09:31:51] <gibson042> timmywil: or iterating over elems backwards in matcherFromGroupMatchers
[09:33:04] <jqcommit> [testswarm] Krinkle pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/av1T9w
[09:33:04] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] fixed depreceted comments starting with '#' - s-a
[09:33:04] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Merge pull request #231 from s-a/fix-deprecated-error-BrowserInfophp - Timo Tijhof
[09:33:04] <timmywil> it's a little better dropping the cache. still not great
[09:35:09] <timmywil> gibson042: why iterate backwards?
[09:36:06] <timmywil> cool if it's faster
[09:36:30] <gibson042> because it'll be VERY common for elems to be in document order, so hitting the end first would correctly set `sizset` for all preceding siblings and they'd hit the preferred fork that sets diff = sizset.substr( childkey.length );
[09:39:21] <timmywil> i see
[09:39:53] <timmywil> but that only helps in comma selectors right?
[09:40:37] <timmywil> gibson042: ^
[09:41:09] <gibson042> no, in just about all nth-child calls
[09:41:24] <gibson042> anytime elems contains consecutive siblings
[09:41:49] <gibson042> I don't have time to try now, but it wouldn't take much (updating slice to the != null condition, calling slice on elems to make it an array, keeping an intermediate array to push.apply( results, intermediate.reverse() ), and changing unmatched.push to unmatched.unshift)
[09:44:31] <timmywil> gibson042: ok, give it a shot later
[09:44:36] <timmywil> :)
[09:44:45] <gibson042> awesome :)
[09:45:02] <gibson042> oh hey, we can also get back the attr speedup for +7 bytes
[09:45:19] <gibson042> (from remembering isXML)
[09:57:13] <gibson042> timmywil: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/156
[09:57:14] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on sizzle by gibson042 ( ago): no ticket: speedup ATTR by remembering isXML
[09:58:13] <gibson042> it gives ATTR 50% more Hz with only negligible impact on everything else
[10:01:15] <timmywil> gibson042: maybe we could just make isXML faster, or keep an xml cache
[10:01:31] <timmywil> might make everything faster
[13:05:23] <Krinkle> Hey, I'm looking for 2 kinds of pages that I suspect may not exist anywhere yet
[13:05:27] <Krinkle> 1) overview of teams
[13:05:34] <Krinkle> 2) list of official irc channels
[13:05:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://jquery.org/team/
[13:06:01] <scott_gonzalez> http://irc.jquery.com/
[13:06:11] <Krinkle> yeah, I know both
[13:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> That's the extent of what we have today.
[13:06:47] <Krinkle> irc.jquery.com is for logging and doesn't appear to be complete (btw, will that stay as subdomain? seems a bit minor for a subdomain)
[13:07:12] <Krinkle> as for teams, I suppose /team is complete indeed. I didn't' know it had captions under each name, that's nice
[13:08:11] <Krinkle> hm.. new github profils
[13:10:06] <ryanneufeld> I'd be open to having my github profile under my name
[13:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: That's not a bad idea.
[13:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub, Twitter, Web site links
[13:11:19] <ryanneufeld> I *might* even go for IRC name
[13:11:25] <Krinkle> Interesting
[13:11:30] <ryanneufeld> though some of us it's obvious
[13:11:31] <Krinkle> perhaps integrate with a web service?
[13:11:38] <ryanneufeld> I have no idea who Krinkle is IRL
[13:11:48] <Krinkle> It says it on the team page
[13:11:54] <Krinkle> and on my github page
[13:12:07] <ryanneufeld> oh, so it does
[13:12:13] <ryanneufeld> TL;DR;
[13:12:37] <Krinkle> perhaps the team page could integrate with about.me, do we all have that?
[13:12:39] <Krinkle> http://about.me/timotijhof
[13:12:47] <Krinkle> from there it has links with other networks and stuff
[13:13:06] <Krinkle> I believe it even has an API, so we wouldn't have to link to about.me directly
[13:15:20] <ryanneufeld> http://about.me/ryanneufeld is mine
[13:15:25] <ryanneufeld> though I don't really have it up to date
[13:15:28] <ryanneufeld> I suppose I should
[13:16:32] <Krinkle> photography is written in your background
[13:16:34] <Krinkle> Interesting
[13:16:53] <Krinkle> Too bad the T in .NET is cut off by the top menu
[13:17:13] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that BG should change shortly
[13:17:15] <ryanneufeld> I just updated it
[13:21:50] <Krinkle> podcast.jquery.com wow that's old
[13:22:08] <Krinkle> we have too many subdomains and little side sites. there's soo many
[13:29:49] <scott_gonzalez> I don't use about.me and don't have any plans to.
[13:30:07] <scott_gonzalez> But if a fair amount of people do, we can certainly use it for those people.
[13:31:30] <ryanneufeld> well, it can be a per-person thing too
[13:54:36] <DaveMethvin> timmywil, gibson042: is this 1.8.2 train ready to leave the station? The hangs from the past few runs seem random http://swarm.jquery.org/job/842
[13:54:41] <DaveMethvin> i guess that's good news
[13:55:17] <timmywil> one sec
[13:55:31] <DaveMethvin> gonna walk the dog brb
[13:55:33] <gibson042> I think so, but we may have a hold for speeding up nth-child
[13:56:18] <timmywil> gibson042: I'll just get rid of the cache for now. We can do something bigger for 1.9
[13:56:51] <gibson042> that sounds fair
[13:57:12] <timmywil> as for holding onto xml for attributes, same thing. I have some plans for handling the environment.
[13:57:28] <timmywil> similar to setDocument in Slick
[13:57:55] <timmywil> we can get into that later tho
[13:58:15] <timmywil> we're pretty solid for 1.8.2
[13:58:41] <gibson042> DaveMethvin, is Sizzle the last thing pending for 1.8.2?
[13:59:14] <gibson042> I may try for nth-child tonight, but not if you're otherwise ready to go
[13:59:16] <sizcommit> [sizzle] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vNrvqg
[13:59:16] <sizcommit> [sizzle/master] Do away with child selector cache until we can do something more widespread. - Timmy Willison
[14:00:59] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: the nth-child was a perf optimization, right?
[14:01:05] <gibson042> right
[14:01:24] <DaveMethvin> i know it's slower now, but it doesn't seem obscenely so
[14:01:54] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/-iXnJw
[14:01:54] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Sizzle: removes nth-child cache - Timmy Willison
[14:01:54] <timmywil> first run is probably about the same. It's a cache issue.
[14:02:24] <timmywil> if it wasn't cache, I'd be more concerned
[14:02:45] <gibson042> and perf is all relative anyway.... the only way to really see changes is to try things in a loop
[14:02:57] <DaveMethvin> so i was only half paying attention on the isXML thing
[14:02:59] <timmywil> still faster than nwmatcher right now
[14:03:33] <timmywil> we mostly dropped from our last version, which overcached
[14:03:36] <gibson042> DaveMethvin, it's just a way to speedup "[attr]" etc. by 50% while still supporting jQuery's replacement of Sizzle.attr
[14:03:48] <DaveMethvin> but would it help to compare the xml status of the last doc and then see if elem.ownerDocument matched that?
[14:03:58] <DaveMethvin> s/compare/cache/
[14:04:05] <timmywil> it's a good speed-up, but I think we should wait on it until we can do something more extensive that affects all selectors, not just attr
[14:04:06] <gibson042> not really
[14:04:34] <gibson042> well, `xml` is already passed around to everything except the replaceable API methods
[14:04:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah which is a good optimization
[14:04:46] <gibson042> attr is definitely the pain point
[14:04:56] <gibson042> because of jQuery :P
[14:05:15] <DaveMethvin> we DEFINE pain point, buddy! :D
[14:05:38] <gibson042> it certainly doesn't need to land for 1.8.2, but it could because it's harmless anyway
[14:05:59] <timmywil> I would want to revert it eventually tho
[14:06:06] <timmywil> it's not pretty
[14:06:07] <gibson042> yeah
[14:06:23] <DaveMethvin> in that case let's hold with what we have
[14:06:28] <DaveMethvin> i'll do a blog post
[14:06:33] <DaveMethvin> and get this out tonight
[14:06:52] <timmywil> well, just so you know, it's not a regression. attributes is slow in all engines
[14:07:27] <DaveMethvin> well good, as long as it's fast enough it hardly matters
[14:07:41] <DaveMethvin> there is always some pathological code out there it seems
[14:07:52] <DaveMethvin> probably faster for us to rewrite their code than ours :P
[14:07:57] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You're killing me. I haven't even added 1.8.1 to UI yet :-P
[14:08:15] <DaveMethvin> you snooze you lose scott_gonzalez
[14:09:00] <DaveMethvin> oh did we put in the breaking changes for mobile and ui? I think mikesherov was assigned
[14:09:17] <timmywil> BLOCKER
[14:09:26] <DaveMethvin> haha
[14:09:36] <scott_gonzalez> I seem to recall you putting those in immediately before tagging last time...
[14:09:50] <DaveMethvin> exactly
[14:09:57] <DaveMethvin> so i'd better do it tonight
[14:10:01] <timmywil> did we do a run through of UI/mobile?
[14:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> $.attrFn = Object.prototype
[14:10:12] <timmywil> lol
[14:10:13] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't and swarm is spinning.
[14:10:54] <gibson042> timmywil: hell, we didn't even do a run through of jQuery
[14:11:09] <DaveMethvin> damn perfectionists
[14:11:10] <timmywil> gibson042: ?
[14:11:16] <DaveMethvin> a few tests hung
[14:11:19] <DaveMethvin> seems random
[14:11:19] <scott_gonzalez> Though lines 2-5 are probably from the last core commit: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui
[14:11:28] <timmywil> oh I think that's just swarm
[14:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, probably not.
[14:11:34] <gibson042> the commit that broke jQuery.attr
[14:11:39] <scott_gonzalez> Since core is still spinning.
[14:11:45] <scott_gonzalez> Downstream projects won't run.
[14:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> We were passing around 2:00a ET this morning.
[14:12:21] <DaveMethvin> we need a todo to have some javascript take the utc and turn it into the local time zon
[14:12:22] <DaveMethvin> e
[14:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> I can kick of a set of tests.
[14:12:41] <timmywil> gibson042: it started hanging even before that
[14:12:45] <scott_gonzalez> I just click through until I end up on GitHub :-P
[14:14:09] <gibson042> well, I'm off for now
[14:14:18] <gibson042> I look forward to all the fresh 1.8.2 bug reports
[14:14:37] <DaveMethvin> pessimist!
[14:14:40] <timmywil> ahahah…wait.
[14:15:15] <scott_gonzalez> I kicked off a build: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/844
[14:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> Seems to be hanging now.
[14:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> At least every test that finished was green :-)
[14:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Do you know what's going on with TestSwarm?
[14:20:48] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We know that it work in Opera 11.6. That's the majority of our user base, right?
[14:20:58] <DaveMethvin> SHIP IT
[14:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> Firefox 14 is green.
[14:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> This sucks.
[14:23:41] <DaveMethvin> Damn UI tests, you slow!
[14:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> I'm presenting on BrowserStack at Strange Loop in a few days.
[14:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> I really don't want to point to TestSwarm and be like "LOOK HOW AWESOME IT IS" and have everything spinning.
[14:24:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's also hard when you don't know if it's us or them or what
[14:24:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[14:24:43] <DaveMethvin> just like that chrome issu
[14:24:45] <DaveMethvin> e
[14:24:53] <Krinkle> Whats going on is that browserstack has some issues with IE VMs, and I haven't finished the rewrite of testswarm-browserstack yet
[14:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: It's pretty much every browser that's hanging.
[14:25:20] <Krinkle> there are a few logic errors in the testswarm-browserstack bridge causing it to mess up and skip browsers or start way too many sometimes.
[14:25:23] <Krinkle> I know
[14:25:30] <Krinkle> hence the second point ^
[14:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> Is there an easy way to basically reset it right now?
[14:26:07] <Krinkle> log in as jquery in testswarm and there you can reset entire jobs or invididual runs
[14:26:14] <Krinkle> reset jobs: big blue button on the job/### page
[14:26:26] <Krinkle> reset runs (part of a job for a particular browser): double click the table cell
[14:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> Will that fix testswarm-browserstack's problem for now?
[14:26:39] <Krinkle> what it will do is reset it, so that it gets another try
[14:26:44] <Krinkle> no guruantee
[14:26:47] <DaveMethvin> has this changed recently? it seemed to behave pretty well a coupla days ago
[14:26:55] <Krinkle> yes, it is a bit random
[14:27:06] <DaveMethvin> seems like bs can be pretty random
[14:27:13] <Krinkle> it seems to build up suspense, explode and then recover and start again
[14:27:27] <Krinkle> like a good action movie but on repeat
[14:28:16] <DaveMethvin> well, i'm about to release 1.8.2 but there's a problem with testswarm, browserstack, ui, jquery, or sizzle. where's my magic 8 ball?
[14:28:38] <scott_gonzalez> It looks pretty solid: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/844
[14:28:45] <Krinkle> If you need results (as opposed to a cool demo), you can do it manually
[14:28:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah gettin there
[14:28:53] <Krinkle> log into browserstack and navigate to testswarm
[14:29:00] <Krinkle> and then let it do its magic
[14:29:21] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Tell me which job you want results for, I'll do it
[14:29:58] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: scott_gonzalez Do both of you have a browserstack account?
[14:30:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah i do
[14:30:08] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: yes
[14:30:14] <Krinkle> alrighty
[14:30:24] <Krinkle> I'll send a url in PM to both of you, just a moment
[14:30:32] <Krinkle> (public joining is disabled in swarm, need a token)
[14:31:24] <DaveMethvin> i can run the ie9 tests here
[14:31:48] <DaveMethvin> on a ferrealz ie9 even

[14:34:41] <Krinkle> (either by browserstack api, or by one of us, whichever comes first)
[14:35:20] <Krinkle> wait a second, I just reset a job started yesterday
[14:35:25] <Krinkle> *yesterday*
[14:35:35] <Krinkle> that's not supposed to be possible, there is a cronjob that does this automaticaly
[14:35:49] <Krinkle> gnarf: does puppet clear out manauly added entries or something?
[14:35:51] <Krinkle> its gone again
[14:36:13] <Krinkle> the cronjob that calls the testswarm api action=cleanup
[14:36:50] <DaveMethvin> testswarm has achieved consciousness, you cannot control it Krinkle
[14:37:05] <gnarf> its in in /etc/crontab  ?
[14:37:09] <gnarf> Krinkle: that one?
[14:37:31] <gnarf> Krinkle: it shouldn't remove any crontab entries unless they are the ones after a # Puppet Name:
[14:37:49] <Krinkle> I don't know where, it just has to be somewhere
[14:37:58] <gnarf> there is one in /etc/crontab
[14:38:00] <Krinkle> okay
[14:38:08] <Krinkle> can you see when it last ran (where does the output go?)
[14:38:18] <gnarf> its piped into /var/log
[14:38:19] <gnarf> but
[14:38:26] <Krinkle> I see
[14:38:27] <Krinkle> * * * * * jenkins curl -s "http://swarm.jquery.org/api.php?action=cleanup" > /var/log/testswarm-api-cleanup.log 2>&1
[14:38:43] <gnarf> i have it piped to /tmp now
[14:38:49] <gnarf> because jenkins doesn't have access to /var/log
[14:38:51] <Krinkle> ..
[14:39:08] <gnarf> one minute we should see the output :)
[14:39:18] <Krinkle> thx
[14:39:25] <gnarf> {"cleanup":{"resetTimedoutRuns":99}}
[14:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> 844 just reset
[14:39:34] <Krinkle> nice
[14:39:47] <Krinkle> it should be a lot more stable now :)
[14:39:58] <Krinkle> at least no job will limbo over 1 minute
[14:40:45] <Krinkle> soon we won;t have limbo at all, with the new homing signal I implemented before the summer we can avoid time outs entirely and detect as soon as a signal goes dead and send it again or somewhere else
[14:41:19] <Krinkle> but at least we got it back to < 1 minute instead of 24 horus
[14:41:32] <gnarf> cool
[14:44:05] <Krinkle> does anyone know the feeling (using Chrome) that you recently visited a website of which the url ranks higher in the url auto-completion for a website you visit very often.
[14:44:19] <Krinkle> need to remove it from history so I can go to browserstack again with 2 characters and hitting return
[14:45:04] <Krinkle> I suppose chrome should learn that when I overwrite it suggestions by going to #2 instead of #1 for the same query very often to learn from that
[14:45:05] <Krinkle> anyway..
[14:46:17] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: chrome://predictors/
[14:46:33] <Krinkle> hm.. interesting
[14:47:18] <Krinkle> interesting, it works
[14:47:29] <Krinkle> must be learning slower than I expected, but this is awesome
[14:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> You can explore other pages like that too: chrome://chrome-urls/
[14:48:06] <Krinkle> nice, It ranks again where it should (I just want to it a few times to bump the rank)
[14:50:19] <Krinkle> "WebKitHack, monospace"
[14:50:37] <Krinkle> (on chrome://blob-internals/)
[14:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> "No available blob data."
[15:01:56] <Krinkle> yeah, but the font
[15:02:07] <Krinkle> I just looked into the source code and found an interesting little hack
[15:02:10] <Krinkle> "WebKitHack, monospace"
[15:02:49] <Krinkle> 844 is looking good
[15:02:51] <Krinkle> lots of green :)

[15:19:37] <ryanneufeld> Boourns, socialhapy 👎
[15:41:33] <Krinkle> http://cl.ly/image/2E1n2Y071z2y
[15:41:41] <Krinkle> People search on google
[15:41:57] <Krinkle> the infobox on the right now has a link 'people also search' that expands to what is shown on that link
[15:42:00] <Krinkle> pretty sweet
[15:42:59] <Krinkle> I wonder how far google can go with their policy of not caring about copyright of the internets content
[15:43:05] <Krinkle> e.g. re-using samples.
[15:43:54] <Krinkle> not just textual snippets from the pages themselves, they're almost building whole new pages with pieces from other stuff. imagine the main column with the blue/green links is gone.
[15:44:11] <Krinkle> that's still a very useful page
[16:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: ETA on 1.8.2?
[16:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm in the mood for some search+replace :-)
[17:39:24] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: finally back to my pc
[17:39:29] <DaveMethvin> starting on the release
[17:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[17:39:36] <DaveMethvin> probably about an hour?
[17:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[17:39:42] <DaveMethvin> assuming no problems
[17:39:53] <DaveMethvin> what am i saying? no problems?
[18:06:27] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: :)
[18:07:04] <DaveMethvin> hey i stil have 30 minutes left!!
[18:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Your PR repsonse wasn't horrible, but something like "Thanks for your contribution. Could you please add some tests for this change?" would be better :-)
[18:10:07] <gnarf> thanks
[18:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> I still have trouble responding appropriately after years of doing this :-/
[18:11:20] <gnarf> yeah
[18:11:22] <gnarf> i meant all that
[18:11:34] <gnarf> just "no new tests?" was the first on my mind :)
[18:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> heh, I know exactly how it is.
[18:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> For example: Not a great response: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/729#issuecomment-8743206
[18:12:11] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-ui by frediana (5h, 31m ago): Autocomplete: trigger _search when get focus back.
[18:12:39] <gnarf> :)
[18:13:32] <scott_gonzalez> We need a script that's like "Your response would fit in a tweet. Are you sure it's acceptable?"
[18:13:38] <gnarf> lol
[18:26:52] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/NLwzfQ
[18:26:52] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Update release notes script to 1.8.2 and add debug option. - Dave Methvin
[18:26:52] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Tagging the 1.8.2 release. - Dave Methvin
[18:26:52] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Updating the source version to 1.8.3pre - Dave Methvin
[18:26:56] <DaveMethvin> BOOM
[18:27:29] <DaveMethvin> wow, it actually looks like the CDN updated
[18:27:43] <DaveMethvin> so something else must have gone horribly wrong and i didn't notice
[18:27:57] <DaveMethvin> on to the blog post!
[18:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I don't think you pushed the tag.
[18:28:58] <DaveMethvin> yep
[18:29:11] <DaveMethvin> had to push it manually
[18:29:11] <scott_gonzalez> Also, you didn't update the license and author links to point to the tag :-P
[18:29:57] <scott_gonzalez> But what I really care about is http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.2.js existing.
[18:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> Now I can update jQuery UI.
[18:30:03] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: well that't because i haven't done that before
[18:30:13] <DaveMethvin> update the license to point to the tag?
[18:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> In package.json.
[18:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> The URLs that point to master should point to the tag.
[18:30:36] <DaveMethvin> oh its the first release since those were added
[18:30:42] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[18:30:43] <DaveMethvin> and the build script doesn't do it
[18:30:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[18:30:52] <scott_gonzalez> Not a big deal.
[18:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> But you should add it to the build script.
[18:31:12] <DaveMethvin> this script is such a pain to run in windows
[18:31:16] <scott_gonzalez> If you're going to commit that to master, you'll also want to undo it when setting the pre version.
[18:31:40] <DaveMethvin> i may just give up and do a linux vm
[18:32:16] <scott_gonzalez> What's the problem?
[18:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> It's node so it should work fine.
[18:32:36] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you're shelling out to stuff that isn't normally on Windows.
[18:33:14] <DaveMethvin> lemme finish the release, i'll cry on your shoulder then
[18:42:16] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: you around? http://blog.jquery.com/2012/09/20/jquery-1-8-2-released/
[18:42:27] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: awesome
[18:42:33] <ajpiano> i've been waiting to make this joke for so long
[18:42:47] <DaveMethvin> 789?

[18:57:00] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: push to master, check on stage
[18:57:07] <gnarf> then tag and push tags
[18:57:11] <gnarf> and its on live

[19:07:13] <gnarf> tag it 1.8.2
[19:07:15] <gnarf> push it
[19:07:29] <gnarf> it should push that live
[19:07:50] <ajpiano> we already um, did a 1.8.2 tag
[19:08:01] <gnarf> on jquery.com ?
[19:08:04] <ajpiano> yeah :(
[19:08:09] <gnarf> call it 1.8.2-1 then
[19:08:10] <ajpiano> the first tag should ahve been 0.0.1, not 1.8.1
[19:08:15] <gnarf> sorry
[19:08:17] <ajpiano> does -1 work
[19:08:21] <gnarf> yes
[19:08:29] <ajpiano> cool
[19:08:36] <gnarf> as long as the tag starts with #.#
[19:08:39] <gnarf> it goes live
[19:08:42] <ajpiano> gotcha
[19:08:44] <gnarf> it doesn't even check ordering
[19:08:45] <ajpiano> good to know
[19:08:51] <gnarf> we could go to 0.0.2 if we wanted
[19:08:54] <DaveMethvin> ok so the act of tagging pushes it live?
[19:09:01] <ajpiano> the act of pushing a tag
[19:09:05] <gnarf> the act of pushing the tag pushes it live
[19:09:07] <DaveMethvin> TIL
