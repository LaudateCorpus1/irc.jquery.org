[02:25:25] <brrc> Hello, i'm using the gmaps plugin for jquery, but I'm using it in a toggled div, that start as display: none or hiden, and that makes the map to be out of place, I can show the real case example online, can anyone help ?
[04:23:16] <Krinkle> brrc: this channel is for development of jquery.js itself, I'll reply in #jquery
[04:24:02] <Krinkle> brrc: the gmaps plugin is not from jquery, that's a third party plugin- of which there are many
[04:24:38] <Krinkle> it says so in the source: http://www.denisewhitesotogrande.com/new/js/jquery.gmap-1.1.0-min.js
