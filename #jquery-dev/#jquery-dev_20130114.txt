[09:49:34] <mikesherov> I had that listed under https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/190
[09:49:34] <b-ot> mikesherov, issue #190 by mikesherov (1mon 3d ago): new signature in 1.9 for $.fn.css: accepts an array to retrieve a map of property names to values
[09:49:57] <mikesherov> kswedberg: has it ready to go

[14:31:37] <Krinkle> http://cdn.omgpost.com/images/2012/March/28/4f73067daf170.jpg
[14:32:00] <Krinkle> I think that's what it can feel like sometimes when someone's wrestling without learning the language.
[14:34:05] <ajpiano> damn krinkleloll
[14:35:39] <Krinkle> Wouldn't you agree? I've seen code that looks like this. Border line getting yourself killed. Anything not to step outside and keep pushing it.
[14:37:10] <Krinkle> ajpiano: btw, do you happen to know anything about a next jquery summit?
[14:37:21] <ajpiano> Krinkle: not yet
[14:38:15] <Krinkle> eg. whether it'll be annual in the  US, or twice a year (once US/ once EU) or picking a different location each year etc. 
[14:38:45] <Krinkle> I see around me all sorts of organisations starting to reserve dates in 2013.
[14:38:54] <Krinkle> lets not be late :)
[14:39:31] <Krinkle> we wouldn't want to end up with a reserved word
[14:39:34] <Krinkle> eh.. a reserved date :P
[14:40:57] <ajpiano> Krinkle: we already have dates for the confs, just have n't figured out summit yet
[14:41:06] <Krinkle> cool
[15:16:26] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I noticed the blog post doesn't mention jquery-to
[15:16:53] <ajpiano> yeah
[15:17:07] <ajpiano> TO isn't actually a jq foundation conf
[15:17:07] <ryanneufeld> whycome?
[15:17:10] <ryanneufeld> oh
[15:17:12] <ryanneufeld> I see
[15:17:18] <ajpiano> though i suppose we could mention it
[15:17:27] <ryanneufeld> is that cause it's in Canadia?
[15:17:36] <ajpiano> it's cause we aren't running it !
[15:17:58] <ryanneufeld> oh
[15:18:08] <ryanneufeld> well, either way I wouldn't be offended
[15:18:11] <ryanneufeld> I'm Canadian
[15:18:18] <ryanneufeld> so I'm sorry
[15:18:18] <ajpiano> haha
[15:18:19] <ryanneufeld> eh.
[15:18:44] <ryanneufeld> I really wanna go to that one though
[15:18:57] <ryanneufeld> cause, you know, not having to go through US customs for a trip is kinda nice :p
[15:19:11] <ryanneufeld> The portland one I'll probably drive down or something
[15:19:33] <ajpiano> ha, yeah
[15:19:39] <ryanneufeld> isn't that in danheberden's area?
[15:22:51] <ajpiano> yeah
[15:44:53] <gf3> ryanneufeld: There's a Portland one?
[15:47:37] <ajpiano> gf3:  ya
[15:47:42] <ajpiano> june 12-14
[15:48:05] <gf3> OH SHI-
[15:48:19] <gf3> ryanneufeld: I split on gas if I can hitch a ride
[15:54:44] <mikesherov> Who's here? 
[15:54:54] <mikesherov> This is a good idea: http://blog.jquery.com/2013/01/14/the-state-of-jquery-2013/#comment-535383
[15:56:09] <gf3> mikesherov: I prefer this comment ‚Üí http://blog.jquery.com/2013/01/14/the-state-of-jquery-2013/#comment-535381
[15:56:35] <ajpiano> hahaa
[15:56:52] <mikesherov> LOL
[15:59:13] <ryanneufeld> gf3: sure dude
[15:59:29] <gf3> ryanneufeld: ‚ù§
[15:59:49] <ryanneufeld> gf3: ass, grass or cash, no one rides for free
[15:59:56] <ryanneufeld> lol
[16:00:22] <gf3> crassh
[16:00:44] <ryanneufeld> gf3: you're not a cigarette chocker are you?
[16:01:06] <gf3> Chocker?
[16:01:11] <ryanneufeld> do you smoke?
[16:01:14] <gf3> No
[16:01:16] <ryanneufeld> good
[16:01:32] <ryanneufeld> I should warn you, I drive like I'm being chased
[16:01:41] <gf3> I will chase you
[16:01:43] <gf3> So it's all good
[16:01:46] <ryanneufeld> nice
[16:01:53] <ryanneufeld> Finally I can justify it
[16:02:14] <ryanneufeld> I could prolly even work it out to pick you up from tswassesnenenshsdsbsbs
[17:53:25] <DaveMethvin> okay, i'm starting to work on the releases
[18:42:59] <mikesherov> good luck, we're all counting on you DaveMethvin 
[18:43:26] <DaveMethvin> i may get shot down over Macho Grande
