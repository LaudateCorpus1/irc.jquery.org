[05:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Such an awesome response for http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13727 :-)
[05:12:03] <DaveMethvin> That was just the kind of mood i was in last night (·óí·ó©·óï)
[05:20:13] <scott_gonzalez> Every time I see someone say "I cannot reproduce this in jsFiddle because <insert basic principle that all web pages allow>" I want to punch someone.
[05:52:46] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle|detached: regarding importing issues to GitHub from Google Code: I produced all the data for GitHub to import using some Node.js modules I wrote but GitHub had to do an internal import process in order to maintain dates and -- where possible -- user accounts (if their Google Account is associated with their GitHub account)
[05:53:31] <JamesMGreene> The integer offset can be controlled by either you during the data creation or else manually set by GH but they prefer the former
[05:54:27] <JamesMGreene> From the 3rd comment: 'If anyone wants to learn more about the conversion process, you can look at JamesMGreene/gc2gh-issue-migrator.  The two scripts for PhantomJS issue migration are under the "examples" folder, too. Far warning, through, gc2gh-issue-migrator is pretty raw and ugly code... definitely not proud of the code but it yields useful results and I didn't want to blow any more 
[05:54:27] <JamesMGreene> time on it at this point, especially since the Google Code issue tracker API is being shutdown in June.'
[05:54:35] <JamesMGreene> The most "major
[05:54:58] <JamesMGreene> The most "major" issue I've noticed is that it wasn't possible to export/import any file attachments
[05:55:10] <JamesMGreene> We didn't really have THAT many so it wasn
[05:55:13] <JamesMGreene> 't a huge deal
[05:55:34] <JamesMGreene> but every now and then someone asks where an attachment is on GH instead of clicking through to the linked GC original issue
[05:57:40] <JamesMGreene> All-in-all, though, people were _really_ pleased with the results
[05:59:30] <JamesMGreene> You need to be a GC project admin for the export process to work correctly for the best importing (get the users' real emails), though
[06:33:01] <JamesMGreene> The only other minor issues I've seen have to do with either [a] plain text vs. markdown (some users write '# blah' or show terminal output that contains Markdown syntactically significant characters, or [b] referenced GC issue numbers (e.g. 'Issue #22') which correspond to pre-existing PR #s on GH
[06:33:29] <JamesMGreene> The latter would be easy to fix, just didn't think about it before
[06:44:19] <JamesMGreene> Happy to explain more when we're both online

[09:01:13] <DaveMethvin> we have achieved quantum testing folks, the unit test fails before the commit!
[09:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> We're so efficient.
[09:07:32] <esas> I might ask here instead of the normal channel. Have there been any plans on including animation support for box-shadow?
[09:07:44] <DaveMethvin> if we're so efficient, why do we use so much memory? http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%201.x%20Core/106/console
[09:07:56] <DaveMethvin> esas no
[09:08:12] <DaveMethvin> you could write a plugin tho
[09:12:27] <esas> DaveMethvin: I have a plugin that adds boxShadow as an option for animate and it works okay :) Just thought it might be good to include native support for it, since that what's animate is supposed to do (animate all provided css properties).
[09:14:23] <DaveMethvin> esas it's documented to animate any single-number css property, is it not doing that?
[09:22:07] <esas> DaveMethvin: Sure, but since box-shadow is not a single-number property, animate can't handle it. I'm just saying it should. Understandable that it's not there if too much code is needed (compared to what is already needed), tho.
[09:23:47] <DaveMethvin> sorry, it's definitely a lot of code to animate those cases and they tend to be edgy and most of the rest of the word won't want to carry it around for the rare cases where you need to animate "border: 1px solid red" to "border: 3px dashed blue"
[09:23:59] <DaveMethvin> but that's why there are plugins
[09:24:07] <DaveMethvin> so special cases won't bloat core
[09:24:15] <DaveMethvin> everyone wins
[09:27:37] <esas> yeah, I can agree with that. the browsers/spec should have included individual properties for setting the box-shadow.
[09:29:08] <DaveMethvin> esas we lobbied, they said no http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2009Nov/0279.html

[09:34:09] <esas> DaveMethvin: oh okay. well, cheers for trying :)
[09:36:08] <esas> although I think they have a bad way of doing things if they are afraid of memory usage problems with the css specification growing.
[09:36:45] <esas> and at the same time I think you can have some confidence in that they are doing good implementations.. it just seemed like a lazy argument
[09:39:06] <DaveMethvin> css3/4 is introducing a lot of properties that we would have previously called "shorthand" properties like border that can take some tricky parsing to get right, and without individual broken-out props for each it's just too expensive to parse given how rarely people want to do it
[09:41:27] <snover> nobody needs to retrieve data structures from CSS DaveMethvin, strings ought to be enough for everybody

[10:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> So that's instead of defining them in externs or whatever?
[10:41:41] <DaveMethvin> right i suppose it could be done with externs
[10:41:53] <DaveMethvin> at least as i understand it
[10:42:13] <DaveMethvin> but we always want to get Expr.find.ID

[10:42:56] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/.jshintrc
[10:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what those groups are.
[10:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> browser/es5 grouping seems to be "environment"
[10:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> eqnull/sub/boss is ???
[10:43:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm not sure either
[10:44:12] <scott_gonzalez> Can we alphabetize them?
[10:44:20] <scott_gonzalez> And remove maxerr.
[10:44:49] <scott_gonzalez> Also: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/237413e75dd3c4b76b0f9ced117f1c9c9cb98ac5#commitcomment-2884028
[10:44:49] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Steven Benner (1mon 5d ago): Changed .jshintrc predef lists to globals objects.
[10:45:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah, alpha seems like a good idea for that big list especially
[10:45:50] <scott_gonzalez> We can keep globals at the bottom.
[10:46:11] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, how about this for grouping:
[10:46:34] <scott_gonzalez> common (rules shared by every jQuery project), repo-specific (for example, sub), globals
[10:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> So es5, browser would fall into repo-specific as well.
[10:47:29] <scott_gonzalez> That way we can easily compare the top group across repos and make sure they're in sync.
[10:47:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that sounds reasonable
[10:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll do some comparisons and figure out what our baseline is.
[10:48:37] <scott_gonzalez> Then I'll send a PR to get some more discussion and agreement on the baseline.
[10:48:54] <DaveMethvin> might want to do an email to jquery-devs-team
[10:49:10] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:21:56] <gnarf> `tell JamesMGreene - There is not currently a ticket tracking this change, I could start one, but it's pretty informal... I have a machine running @ jenkins.jquery.com now, you should have SSH
[11:21:56] <b-ot> gnarf: I‚Äôll tell JamesMGreene about that.
[11:51:05] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez i'm going to be at at this event next week: http://blogs.adobe.com/webplatform/2013/03/21/test-the-web-forward-seattle-2013/
[11:51:24] <DaveMethvin> jacob rossi from MS will be there, maybe I can work on those touch event tests?
[11:57:32] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we were discussing that on the call.
[11:58:23] <scott_gonzalez> I'm hoping to get started on some tests today, but it's getting late.

[13:34:22] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron ping regarding http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13566
[13:43:04] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin looking
[13:43:54] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13566#comment:4
[13:44:17] <rwaldron> hm
[13:44:41] <DaveMethvin> well, i'm okay with breaking things if we document the alternatives
[13:44:50] <rwaldron> I dont know
[13:44:53] <rwaldron> this is odd
[13:44:58] <rwaldron> seems like an easy thing to fix
[13:45:17] <DaveMethvin> right now, if someone loads jq in node they get window.jQuery set 
[13:45:24] <DaveMethvin> in 1.9 that is
[13:45:27] <DaveMethvin> but in 2.0 we skip it
[13:45:37] <rwaldron> ugh
[13:45:41] <DaveMethvin> but there may not even be a window object
[13:45:48] <DaveMethvin> so we'd need to check for that
[13:45:48] <rwaldron> so there is all kinds of code relying on this stupid behaviour
[13:45:53] <DaveMethvin> yesh
[13:46:07] <DaveMethvin> like jsdom
[13:46:16] <DaveMethvin> it kind of makes sense
[13:46:36] <DaveMethvin> if we're loaded into a browser-like env we should treat it like a browser
[13:46:59] <DaveMethvin> since this is 2.0 only we could check for typeof window === "object" perhaps?
[13:47:00] <rwaldron> I like Isaac's first suggestion
[13:47:10] <rwaldron> just look for typeof window === 'object'
[13:47:14] <rwaldron> haha
[13:47:24] <rwaldron> I'll drop that in.
[13:47:25] <DaveMethvin> i'm good with that
[13:47:49] <DaveMethvin> thanks ... also i just pinged you via email on ticket http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11570 rwaldron
[13:48:10] <DaveMethvin> oh actually forgot to press submit ... so i wont
[13:48:48] <rwaldron> real quick...
[13:49:10] <rwaldron> if ( typeof window !== "object" && typeof module === "object" && typeof module.exports === "object" ) {
[13:49:26] <DaveMethvin> oh
[13:49:27] <rwaldron> to get the window.jQuery where there is a window object?
[13:49:46] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, if there is a window do we want to set exports?
[13:49:52] <DaveMethvin> even if it's there?
[13:50:09] <DaveMethvin> damn i hate this
[13:50:12] <rwaldron> yeah
[13:50:15] <rwaldron> me too
[13:50:30] <rwaldron> so let's add a different condition
[13:50:50] <rwaldron> (after the existing)
[13:50:59] <rwaldron> if ( typeof window !== "object" ) { 	// Otherwise expose jQuery to the global object as usual
[13:50:59] <rwaldron> 	window.jQuery = window.$ = jQuery;
[13:50:59] <rwaldron> }
[13:51:06] <rwaldron> that should be ===
[13:51:11] <rwaldron> i just copy/pasted
[13:52:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah that makes sense
[13:52:44] <DaveMethvin> we just won't assume a window object which is good and shoudl work on all browsres
[13:53:22] <rwaldron> sure
[13:53:30] <rwaldron> if people are making var window = ...
[13:53:35] <rwaldron> that's their own fault
[13:53:40] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin https://gist.github.com/rwldrn/5314266
[13:54:02] <DaveMethvin> yep, looks good
[13:54:08] <DaveMethvin> i wonder what it will break :D
[13:54:09] <rwaldron> great, committing

[14:21:17] <dcherman> if you want to simplify it, $.isWindow would probably work fine also
[14:21:27] <DaveMethvin> rabbit hole, rabbit  hole, goin down the rabbit hole :D
[14:21:30] <dcherman> if someone really defines this.window = this in node...thats their own fault imo
[14:22:11] <DaveMethvin> seems like the window they pass us should have a document though, so it's a better logical match
[14:22:27] <rwaldron> right
[14:22:30] <rwaldron> that was my thinking
[14:22:43] <rwaldron> ok
[14:22:49] <DaveMethvin> less wtfy
[14:23:00] <rwaldron> Domenic (who maintains jsdom) has confirmed this will be acceptable
[14:23:11] <dcherman> that works - you can get rid of the first condition though since we know that typeof window === "object" is always true, right?
[14:23:11] <DaveMethvin> oh thanks for checking!
[14:23:20] <rwaldron> [5:22 PM] <Domeni___> i'm pretty sure it will.
[14:23:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah `this` can't be non-objecty
[14:23:39] <rwaldron> dcherman no it's not always true
[14:24:15] <rwaldron> if there is another thing similar to jsdom that expects jQuery to module.exports etc
[14:24:25] <rwaldron> and makes no global.window
[14:24:31] <rwaldron> oh my god what a nightmare
[14:24:33] <dcherman> ah ok, fair enough.
[14:24:40] <rwaldron> you're probably right

[14:47:54] <m_gol> Yeah, I was wondering if at least detecting it in Opera would be feasible but then events order change so it's not worth to introduce such an inconsistency, especially now that Presto is going away
[14:48:45] <DaveMethvin> Yeah the Opera people say they will support Presto until 2020 but it seems unlikely anyone will be using it until then
[14:49:17] <m_gol> yeah, they're talking mainly about some TVs having Presto browsers built-in
[14:50:13] <DaveMethvin> the nice thing is that Opera hasn't contributed a lot of bugs to the things we need to fix so it really doesn't matter that much to us
[14:50:25] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately we still need to do basic testing with it
[14:50:39] <m_gol> I thought that only IE has such only-via-addEventListener quirks (this broke my little wheel plugin and I had to do some nasty UA-sniffing), isn't it the rule that all events on DOM elements should have ('on' + eventType) attribute exposed?
[14:51:04] <m_gol> yeah, it seems in 2.x WebKit is the bad guy mostly
[14:51:18] <m_gol> and mostly in Safari, Chrome at least patches quickly
[14:52:16] <DaveMethvin> i dunno what the rules are for DOM0 style listeners (onxxxx) but I think they're only required for the events that existed at the time
[14:52:26] <DaveMethvin> it's just that a lot more got exposed over time
[14:52:55] <m_gol> I know it's a bad idea to use them, it's just browser vendors seem not to notice that it's the only way to detect if event is supported
[14:53:25] <snover> there is no rule for the dom 2 events
[14:53:28] <m_gol> I can trigger any weird "string" via addEventListener so AFAIK there's no way to detect via it
[14:54:12] <m_gol> unless I don't know sth ;)

[16:47:03] <m_gol> is iOS 4 still supported? (that's the last version available for iPhone 3G, newer ones have iOS 6)
[16:47:25] <DaveMethvin> are there a lot of iPhone 3G around?
[16:47:34] <DaveMethvin> i hope not :)
[16:47:58] <DaveMethvin> IMO Safari 5.0x is as far back as we should worry about
[16:48:10] <gibson042> m_gol is this in relation to https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1216 ?
[16:48:10] <b-ot> gibson042: Pull request #1216 by gibson042 (1d 6h ago): Fix #13596; #13722: .replaceWith consistency
[16:48:35] <gibson042> I'm checking on that now
[16:48:57] <m_gol> no, I'm checking if any further workarounds can be removed
[16:49:35] <m_gol> now that I have access to BrowserStack I'm testing on mobile, too and some Safari workarounds are no longer needed for desktop Safari so I'd like to know which iOS versions need to work
[16:51:34] <m_gol> and for these ones that are needed on supported iOS & Android I'd add comments so that it's clear when they can be dropped since I'm testing anyway now
[16:52:21] <gibson042> excellent
[16:52:56] <m_gol> I know Android is supported from 2.3 but I don't know about iOS :)
[16:53:18] <DaveMethvin> http://www.netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=2&qpcustomd=1
[16:53:40] <DaveMethvin> not sure i belive that, it almost seems cheery
[16:53:42] <snover> netapplications, really
[16:54:10] <DaveMethvin> if you need stats real bad, we've got real bad stats
[16:54:32] <m_gol> their mobile Safari recognitions are weird, what's Safari 536...
[16:54:55] <DaveMethvin> it's 5.72% obviously! :)
[16:55:14] <snover> could be safari 6, could be chrome 20
[16:55:32] <DaveMethvin> i know there are a ton of old Android 2.x mobile browsers out there still
[16:55:36] <DaveMethvin> not reflected here
[16:56:01] <m_gol> gs.statcounter.com has more conf. options in their stats
[16:56:11] <m_gol> thought they're not weighing them
[16:56:16] <m_gol> so they're more optimistic ;)
[16:56:49] <m_gol> meh, but they have Browser, Browser Version & Mobile Browser but no Mobile Browser Version...
[16:56:59] <DaveMethvin> SO close
[16:57:31] <m_gol> there's also mobile OS but without version, too
[16:57:41] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery 1.x Core build #108: STILL FAILING in 31 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%201.x%20Core/108/
[16:57:41] <doesallmagic> richard.gibson: Ref 65a66489: oldIE handholding for native event tests
[16:58:17] <DaveMethvin> i haven't checked lately, is swarmy sane at ALL?
[16:58:32] <m_gol> I can find a lot of unofficial stats for iOS but they're mostly from app developers and people using apps tend to upgrade OS more often so it's probably too optimistic
[16:58:53] <DaveMethvin> i just pinged the guys in #jquerymobile-dev to see if they have a better source
[16:58:55] <snover> that‚Äôs a weird statement
[16:59:25] <DaveMethvin> i dunno what events drive ppl to upgrade browsers
[16:59:41] <DaveMethvin> i had a Nexus One for two years and it was stuck on android 2.4 browser
[16:59:45] <snover> http://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html
[16:59:49] <DaveMethvin> afaik i never had the chance to update
[17:00:07] <m_gol> on mobile it's usually correlated to OS upgrades
[17:00:16] <m_gol> at least for iOS & Android stock browser
[17:00:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah 
[17:00:23] <m_gol> dunno about Firefox & stuff
[17:00:42] <DaveMethvin> the android 4.0 browser is okay but it's only about half the market
[17:01:40] <snover> well, people on old android can install opera or chrome
[17:02:13] <snover> but android 2.3 is like ie6, no more vendor support means no more updates
[17:02:22] <snover> i mean, carrier support
[17:02:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah they are pretty bad phones
[17:02:35] <m_gol> IE6 is still supported! ;)
[17:02:41] <DaveMethvin> but some 2.x phones are being sold too!
[17:02:42] <m_gol> for another year
[17:03:17] <m_gol> this is fascinating, people use all these phones that no longer receive any updates, even security ones
[17:03:21] <snover> if someone buys a $50 android tablet running android 2.x that doesn‚Äôt mean it should be supported‚Ä¶
[17:03:26] <m_gol> and they're still sold in this state... amazing
[17:03:37] <m_gol> well, it's all about market share
[17:03:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[17:03:59] <m_gol> if half the population buys obsolete stuff we have no choice but to support it :(
[17:04:18] <DaveMethvin> when carriers are selling new phones with android 2.2 then it's not going away very quickly
[17:04:44] <snover> m_gol: that is a wrong statement :)
[17:05:09] <DaveMethvin> someone's gotta support it
[17:05:27] <snover> that sounds wrong
[17:05:32] <DaveMethvin> what's wrong with swarmy lately? It seems to hate oldIE as much as us http://swarm.jquery.org/job/271
[17:05:32] <m_gol> 2.2? jQuery supports "only" >=2.3, right?
[17:06:00] <DaveMethvin> for some definitoin of "support" that's always the trick
[17:06:19] <DaveMethvin> we don't have it nearly as bad as the Mobile guys
[17:07:05] <m_gol> yeah, in jQuery wiki there's nothing saying about mobile browsers at all
[17:07:14] <m_gol> so it's kind of a guessing game ;)
[17:07:34] <m_gol> jQuery mobile is mostly a higher-level framework, though?
[17:07:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[17:07:44] <m_gol> I had an impression it's closer to jq UI
[17:07:50] <DaveMethvin> so they have to deal with issues like transitions not working
[17:08:01] <m_gol> oh, that's a mess
[17:08:19] <m_gol> that inspired me to begin this long topic on dev forum about getting event handlers ;)
[17:08:39] <m_gol> I actually use transitions for all animations in the recent project I'm working on
[17:08:51] <m_gol> but it requires a lot of hacking sometimes
[17:09:00] <m_gol> force-refreshing styles, for example...
[17:09:59] <m_gol> but only when I have to manually do sth so I hope it helps performance at least a little
[17:10:31] <snover> the problem with transitions is that the people that wrote the css transitions spec are clueless :)
[17:11:24] <DaveMethvin> there's a tension between giving program access to all that juicy stuff vs just handing some bits to the graphics system and letting it run
[17:12:20] <m_gol> yeah, I suppose it's hard to access all in progress "steps"
[17:12:28] <m_gol> but at least start & end could be easier to handle
[17:12:39] <m_gol> browsers batch style changes so it's a problem sometimes
[17:12:46] <m_gol> e.g. transitioning from 0 to auto
[17:13:12] <DaveMethvin> like snover said they didn't exactly trial this with js devs before dumping it on our doorstep in a basket
[17:13:18] <DaveMethvin> that would have helped
[17:13:31] <DaveMethvin> i hope we're getting them better trained now
[17:13:49] <m_gol> I actually have to disable transitions, refresh styles, go to auto, check used style, go back to 0, re-enable transitions, force style refresh, transition to the checked used style and restore to auto on transitionend
[17:13:51] <m_gol> a real mess
[17:13:52] <snover> considering all the shorthand combined comma-separated nonsense we‚Äôre getting now‚Ä¶i‚Äôd say no
[17:14:51] <m_gol> it seems they thought they'll just create a transitionend event and it'll be enough... not
[17:15:38] <m_gol> a mobile-friendly version of the test suite site could be useful ;)
[17:15:44] <DaveMethvin> but if they have a progress callback they've created a link btwn the graphics processor and the single-threaded js prog
[17:15:52] <DaveMethvin> which adds all sorts of issues
[17:15:54] <m_gol> just fired jQuery test suite on Galaxy Note with Android 2.3 and everything is so tiny!
[17:16:11] <DaveMethvin> as long as it's so GREEN we're good
[17:16:31] <m_gol> not so much, unfortunately ;)
[17:16:44] <m_gol> I just want to ensure I'm not adding new errors
[17:16:55] <m_gol> but current master on iOS 4 fails about 9 tests
[17:17:11] <m_gol> that's one of reasons I asked if it's supported
[17:17:16] <DaveMethvin> only 4? decent
[17:17:22] <DaveMethvin> only 9 that is
[17:17:26] <DaveMethvin> still decent
[17:17:45] <DaveMethvin> i think the old blackberry 5 fails all the position tests now
[17:18:57] <m_gol> should I worry about iOS 4?
[17:19:11] <DaveMethvin> numbers seem to say no
[17:19:15] <m_gol> ok
[17:19:27] <m_gol> I was able to gain 173 bytes gzipped and it's OK with Safari 5.1 but then we're entering the mobile world...
[17:19:47] <m_gol> maybe I'll update some support comments at least
[17:19:47] <DaveMethvin> 173? wat?
[17:20:21] <m_gol> webkit stuff mostly
[17:20:47] <m_gol> e.g. the margin-right hook doesn't seem to be needed in Safari 5.1
[17:20:56] <m_gol> but iOS 4 requires it
[17:23:58] <m_gol> but a more realistic thing, saved 38 bytes here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1220

[18:23:05] <JamesMGreene> `read
[18:23:06] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: From gnarf, 7h 1m ago: - There is not currently a ticket tracking this change, I could start one, but it's pretty informal... I have a machine running @ jenkins.jquery.com now, you should have SSH
[18:23:57] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: And also note the open issues: https://github.com/JamesMGreene/gc2gh-issue-migrator/issues
[18:36:16] <gnarf> ajpiano: you here?
[18:38:31] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Looks like we just witnessed a github deployment of the issue tracker redesign
[18:38:43] <Krinkle> At least I just got a new look
[18:41:09] <m_gol> me too
[18:49:59] <gnarf> Krinkle: btw, .com vs .org on jenkins... I tend to think that the pattern we want to have is that only foundation related content on .org, but then again, it confuses me every time...  cc ajpiano scott_gonzalez rworth
[18:50:35] <gnarf> personally, i think jenkins.jquery.com can handle ui/mobile/qunit/etc
[18:51:33] <gnarf> I'm not gonna have any more time to play with it tonight
[18:51:57] <gnarf> if anyone else wants to copy settings over / try to spin up some jobs, you're welcome to it, just keep me updated on what you needed to install/ssh keys, etc
[18:52:10] <gnarf> JamesMGreene / Krinkle / jzaefferer
[18:52:17] <Krinkle> events.jquery.org contribute.jquery.org swarm.jquery.org  jenkins.jquery.org ?
[18:52:29] <gnarf> swarm is the oddball there
[18:52:31] <gnarf> imo
[18:52:54] <gnarf> events is basically jquery foundation (and members) events, contribute is about more than just the code
[18:53:58] <Krinkle> yeah
[18:53:59] <Krinkle> I see
[18:54:03] <Krinkle> Lets keep it on com
[18:54:12] <Krinkle> and perhaps fix swarm as wlel
[18:54:15] <Krinkle> that should be easy right?
[18:54:18] <gnarf> yeah
[18:54:46] <gnarf> also, i was planning on making http://jenkins.jquery.com/ forward to 8080 through nginx
[18:54:47] <gnarf> so 
[18:54:49] <Krinkle> create subdmain, points IP, rename vhost on jq03 and add vhost to for redirect
[18:54:53] <gnarf> either would work
[18:55:01] <Krinkle> gnarf: Why on 8080 at all?
[18:55:10] <gnarf> well, nginx will be on 80
[18:55:21] <gnarf> i don't wanna put jenkins on the front on that ip
[18:55:21] <Krinkle> jenkins has a built-in server?
[18:55:27] <Krinkle> Oh, that's right.
[18:55:43] <Krinkle> Yeah we have the same at Wikimedia
[18:55:48] <Krinkle> (though with Apache)
[18:55:50] <gnarf> in case we ever want to host another side domain on that for some purpose (i.e. serving built files instead of copying to swarm)
[18:56:00] <Krinkle> Lets make sure to make 8080 private then
[18:56:02] <Krinkle> localhost only
[18:56:13] <gnarf> we can do that, and I opened it up in the firewall
[18:56:18] <gnarf> for now
[18:56:23] <gnarf> i can remove if we move it to :80
[18:56:40] <Krinkle> only listen for hostname localhost, and allow, deny allow 127.0.01 / :1;1. or something liek that
[18:56:51] <Krinkle> then proxy with nginx
[18:56:56] <Krinkle> sounds good
[18:56:58] <gnarf> the helix has a access list of ports to allow
[18:57:05] <gnarf> i can just remove 8080 and it does all that :)
[18:57:22] <Krinkle> It doesn't do all that, but it results in the same
[18:57:29] <Krinkle> It would still allow it within the cluster
[18:57:31] <Krinkle> which is fine
[18:57:50] <gnarf> local ip's is one of the targets in the CIDR mask for the allow
[18:57:57] <gnarf> so i'm pretty sure it walls local too
[18:57:58] <Krinkle> yeah
[18:58:39] <Krinkle> lower level is better :)
[19:00:15] <Krinkle> gnarf: Is https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/ajax-script-2.0 HTTP 406 (blank) for you as well?

[19:04:46] <Krinkle> Hm.. no that won't wor
[19:04:47] <Krinkle> work*
[19:04:55] <Krinkle> So it is a bug in full
[19:39:03] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: Yeah, there was a GH Issues facelift today
[19:40:22] <JamesMGreene> https://twitter.com/jasonlong/status/319963555065655296
[19:40:22] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: @jasonlong: .@cameronmcefee and I just shipped a little design refresh to the @github issues page.
[19:53:11] <nschonni> I'm trying to very roughly gauge the jquery 2.0 release date. I'm trying to avoid some YAGNI code in a project I work in. If jQuery 2.0 is very early fall/late summer I'd really like to pull out some oldIE conditional stuff
[19:56:18] <DaveMethvin> nschonni jQuery 2.0 should be out this month.
[19:56:46] <nschonni> congrats team :)
[19:56:57] <nschonni> damn for my unrelated arguement :(
[20:00:07] <nschonni> i'm trying to prevent them releasing the 1.9 to 2.0 as a bug fix
[20:00:29] <DaveMethvin> nschonni is this a web site, or is it an app?
[20:00:40] <nschonni> framework
[20:00:57] <nschonni> that's mostly why i'm concerned. unforseen consequences
[20:01:05] <DaveMethvin> so if you need oldIE support i'd just make 1.9 a requirement
[20:01:18] <nschonni> https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew
[20:01:27] <DaveMethvin> the apis are the same so as far as a framework is concerned it prolly won't matter
[20:01:33] <nschonni> we're moving with a JQM first approach in the next release
[20:01:50] <nschonni> but it has a conditional for oldIE till the next major
[20:02:15] <DaveMethvin> there will be another (final i hope) beta coming out soon
[20:02:23] <DaveMethvin> give it a try and let us know feedback
[20:03:00] <nschonni> Yeah, I was just trying to figure out here https://github.com/wet-boew/wet-boew/issues/1811
[20:03:00] <b-ot> nschonni: Issue #1811 by nschonni (7h 22m ago): Remove jquery-ie.min.js
[20:03:47] <nschonni> if we should cut out the conditional till we know for sure about the jquery 2.0 would fall between this release and the next major

[20:05:16] <nschonni> we've already fixed all issues with 1.9 without having to use the migrate plugin

[20:06:13] <nschonni> we've pushed back as many fixes to upstream plugins that would take them
