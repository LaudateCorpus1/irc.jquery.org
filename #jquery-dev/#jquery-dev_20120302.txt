[04:51:43] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell DaveMethvin You better crack the whip if you want to get to a full year of <250 open tickets http://bugs.jquery.com/ticketgraph?days=365 :-P
[04:51:44] <bot-t1> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[06:57:07] <bartmax> have a bug but cant fill because 'looks like' spam
[06:57:10] <bartmax> anyone can help me ?
[06:57:32] <ajpiano> bartmax: is it actually a bug
[06:57:34] <ajpiano> :|
[06:57:40] <ajpiano> bartmax: sorry about the spam thing, do you have an account?
[06:57:49] <danheberden> bartmax what error are you getting?
[06:57:52] <bartmax> http://jsfiddle.net/wybre/3/
[06:57:56] <danheberden> (we disabled the ip limiter)
[06:58:11] <bartmax> i *think* i have an account bart@bartmax.com
[06:58:14] <bartmax> the problem is .. hold on
[06:58:40] <ajpiano> hm, looks like a bug in fact!
[06:59:03] <bartmax> ajpiano: i want my FOUND  A BUG badge :D
[06:59:20] <bartmax> damn browser is kinda slow with 80+ open tabs ...
[06:59:53] <bartmax> ajpiano: looks like someone passed on the 'selector' tests :D
[07:00:05] <danheberden> akismet said it was spam
[07:00:07] <danheberden> interesting
[07:00:14] <danheberden> ranked it a -5
[07:00:25] <ajpiano> it's an event bug more likely, i'm sure DaveMethvin will want to take a looksee
[07:00:31] <danheberden> oh, wait, i think that's the stragety in place
[07:01:22] <bartmax> error is : Submission rejected as potential spam (Akismet says content is spam)
[07:01:39] <bartmax> tryed to submit again
[07:01:44] <bartmax> my email is bart@bartmax.com
[07:01:48] <bartmax> dunno if you can see it either way
[07:01:57] <danheberden> bartmax yeah, i saw the failed attempts
[07:02:09] <bartmax> ok. i don't know what i did wrong.
[07:02:20] <danheberden> ajpiano any ideas on the akismet part?
[07:02:24] <danheberden> i know you've dealt with that a bit
[07:02:34] <ajpiano> not really, i think all i did was turn it on :|
[07:03:00] <DaveMethvin> bartmax: try it with (edge)
[07:03:01] <bot-t1> (2 hours 11 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell DaveMethvin You better crack the whip if you want to get to a full year of <250 open tickets http://bugs.jquery.com/ticketgraph?days=365 :-P
[07:03:03] <danheberden> twss
[07:03:04] <bartmax> edge ?
[07:03:30] <DaveMethvin> in jsfiddle, choose "jQuery (edge)" in the dropdown and click Run
[07:03:52] <ajpiano> lol
[07:03:53] * ajpiano sucks
[07:03:57] <ajpiano> should have noticed
[07:03:59] <bartmax> doesn't work either DaveMethvin
[07:04:20] <bartmax> DaveMethvin: now it's different, it triggers only ONCE but for all matching selectors
[07:04:24] <bartmax> dunno if that's intented
[07:04:30] <bartmax> and what's is jquery edge btw ?
[07:04:37] <danheberden> bartmax adjusted min karma to what you have/got
[07:04:43] <danheberden> so you should be able to report now
[07:04:54] <DaveMethvin> edge is built nightly, it's the latest and greatest
[07:05:09] <danheberden> s/nightly/every 5 minutes/
[07:05:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah true
[07:05:20] <bartmax> danheberden: reported successfully now.
[07:05:24] <DaveMethvin> it's pipin' fresh
[07:05:24] <danheberden> bartmax awes
[07:05:32] <DaveMethvin> the event triggers once for each element where the event is attached
[07:05:35] <danheberden> DaveMethvin sry i haven't gotten that new branch one up yet
[07:05:44] <bartmax> DaveMethvin: if 2 matches selectors match the .one, should it trigger one for each or one for all of them ?
[07:05:55] <ajpiano> bartmax: it only triggers once
[07:06:00] <bartmax> so if i attach to document, it will only one.
[07:06:03] <bartmax> huh :(
[07:06:03] <danheberden> DaveMethvin we were supposed to get our new services box a few days ago :/
[07:06:07] <DaveMethvin> for a delegated event where there was only one element where it was attached, it woudl trigger once
[07:06:19] <bartmax> ok, so in edge is already 'working'
[07:06:38] <DaveMethvin> bartmax we can't predict the future so if you add more elements later we can't know that they haven't been done once
[07:07:01] <DaveMethvin> the .one() applies to the delegation point not the element matching the selector
[07:07:17] <DaveMethvin> if you created a ticket we can clarify in the docs
[07:08:11] <bartmax> DaveMethvin: ok. so i need to use live then.
[07:08:23] <DaveMethvin> nope, live is the same
[07:08:25] <bartmax> don't get it, without live i would not be able to reproduce the functionability with on.
[07:08:41] <bartmax> mmm let me think.
[07:09:13] <DaveMethvin> oic
[07:09:40] <DaveMethvin> you can do the one-ness yourself with either .on(), .delegate(), or YUCK .live()
[07:09:47] <DaveMethvin> that is, just have the handler detach itself
[07:09:50] <DaveMethvin> once it runs
[07:10:27] <DaveMethvin> but for delegated events it's the attachment point that matters, not the selector
[07:10:35] <bartmax> but ... if i do (document) on and detach, i will detach from all elements
[07:10:51] <bartmax> i *think* i need the (selector).live()
[07:11:20] <ajpiano> bartmax: .live *is* .on, you aren't cheating the system by using it
[07:12:10] <bartmax> i will eat something and then rewrite this, mind kinda messy right now.
[07:12:23] <bartmax> and btw, this matter does not belongs to jquery-dev :)
[07:12:31] <bartmax> bug filled and as I see, it's fixed already on edge.
[07:12:42] <bartmax> so thanks. /me backs to jquery standard chan :D
[07:12:59] <bartmax> still, ajpiano you OWE me now the 'FOUND A BUG' badge.
[07:13:03] <DaveMethvin> bartmax: http://jsfiddle.net/dmethvin/wybre/5/
[07:13:17] <DaveMethvin> really, the "focus" name is not correct because focus doesn't bubble
[07:13:21] <DaveMethvin> but we try to fix it up for you
[07:13:29] <DaveMethvin> it is better to use the bubbling name though
[07:13:40] <DaveMethvin> the .on() docs mention that
[07:14:06] <bartmax> DaveMethvin: that fiddle still doesn't fire once per element (what i want to accomplish)
[07:14:18] <bartmax> and elements are loaded via ajax, of course.
[07:14:21] <bartmax> dyn
[07:14:40] <DaveMethvin> you would need to track that yourself then
[07:15:02] <DaveMethvin> or find someone willing to work through another solution
[07:15:02] <bartmax> DaveMethvin: i think i should remove something from the dom to make it not match anymore
[07:15:33] <DaveMethvin> well the important thing to me is that there is no bug in (edge) so my work here is done ... :D
[07:15:43] <bartmax> DaveMethvin: ok, thanks!
[07:16:03] <bartmax> DaveMethvin: good to know it's fixed already
[15:59:29] <mikesherov> damn, no DaveMethvin?
