[10:39:01] <timmywil> markelog: if you're there, you want to talk about the tickets you linked?
[10:39:22] <markelog> timmywil:sure thing, just give me a minute
[10:39:34] <markelog> i need to finish an argument at the github :)
[10:39:51] <timmywil> well, if it's to me, argue with me here :)
[10:40:48] <timmywil> I can explain in detail why those perfs are valid.
[10:40:48] <markelog> how i would i show it to my grandkids then?
[10:41:01] <markelog> i think it is a rabbit whole
[10:41:17] <markelog> i'm pretty sure i will maintain my opinion
[10:41:25] <markelog> and i'm pretty sure you would to
[10:41:30] <timmywil> ok, let me try to persuade you
[10:41:35] <timmywil> kindly
[10:41:37] <markelog> okay, shoot
[10:41:54] <timmywil> I'm mainly interested in these lines https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/css/showHide.js#L61
[10:42:34] <timmywil> which differ from 2.2 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/33b548c8e3d43b2ebdfb129fd8086a3b0c905919/src/css.js#L209
[10:42:43] <timmywil> notice the extra isHidden call
[10:43:11] <timmywil> I can tell you for certain that the perf issue that paul showed us had to do with retrieving computed display on each call to hide.
[10:43:24] <timmywil> webkit was super slow retrieving it for some reason
[10:43:56] <timmywil> by skipping that and just setting display: none, we did improve performance
[10:44:09] <timmywil> so, really, hiding hidden elements is an okay case to check
[10:44:30] <timmywil> because before we were avoiding setting display, but now we set it all the time
[10:44:41] <timmywil> and it turns out that it was faster to do so
[10:44:55] <markelog> paul_irish_ was taking about wikipedia case?
[10:45:14] <markelog> with their editor?
[10:45:49] <timmywil> yea https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/88#issuecomment-72479215
[10:46:08] <timmywil> most of the time there was spent in isHidden
[10:46:18] <timmywil> for a bunch of hide calls
[10:47:22] <timmywil> I checked it multiple times
[10:47:35] <timmywil> maybe it was doing a layout or something
[10:47:46] <timmywil> either way, by avoiding that call, we got a perf boost
[10:48:06] <markelog> hide calls yeah, but not for already hidden elements
[10:48:09] <timmywil> now, I will concede that you have a point about the cases we've skipped
[10:48:11] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil are you releasing later today? I'm ready to press the button on a "Ten years of jQuery" post
[10:48:23] <DaveMethvin> so it would be good to wait a few hours that we won't step on each other
[10:48:23] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: that's the plan
[10:48:31] <DaveMethvin> ok later today then
[10:48:45] <markelog> since i'm looking at the code of right after the words "And let's look at how it ended up getting used:"
[10:48:50] <DaveMethvin> we'll go ahead with this blog post now
[10:49:11] <timmywil> markelog: those lines still get hit for hidden elements
[10:49:26] <markelog> if showHandles used correctly
[10:49:28] <markelog> then no
[10:49:53] <markelog> since they call it without arguments
[10:49:57] <markelog> it would show all elements
[10:50:00] <markelog> with arguments
[10:50:02] <timmywil> how so? isHidden was getting called even before we checked display === none
[10:50:04] <markelog> it will hide all elements
[10:50:27] <timmywil> now we check if display is already none, but that's it
[10:50:36] <markelog> i meant the legitimacy of the hide already hidden elements
[10:50:40] <markelog> case
[10:51:03] <markelog> since in their case, they either show or hide, not hide hide
[10:51:40] <timmywil> ok, well the first perf was to demonstrate that we no longer call isHidden
[10:51:57] <markelog> you did that, not argue that you was not
[10:52:03] <markelog> did not
[10:52:08] <timmywil> ok, so we agree there
[10:52:17] <timmywil> I understand now what you're saying
[10:52:38] <markelog> "ok, so we agree there" -> yeah, i think so :-)
[10:52:59] <timmywil> and I will concede that it's not a valid case in the sense you're describing
[10:53:32] <timmywil> but doesn't my latest jsperf address that? testing the hide on a bunch of elements that are shown in between tests?
[10:53:45] <markelog> let me check it
[10:54:23] <timmywil> By the way, I'm not sure the show path is faster.
[10:54:32] <timmywil> I just wanted to show off hide
[10:54:38] <markelog> it should be 
[10:54:51] <markelog> since we don't use contains() anymore
[10:54:55] <timmywil> ok, and that's for the reason you mentioned before?
[10:55:00] <markelog> yeap
[10:55:03] <timmywil> I see
[10:55:13] <timmywil> ok, then I think we were both right about different things
[10:55:14] <markelog> http://jsperf.com/old-vs-new-show-hide/2
[10:55:21] <timmywil> this is why I wanted to talk it out :)
[10:55:31] <markelog> thank you timmywil!
[10:55:49] <markelog> at github we might have continue to not understand each other
[10:56:17] <markelog> my perf checks both cases
[10:56:30] <markelog> and it also very have positive results
[10:56:38] <markelog> "have very"
[10:57:07] <timmywil> I'll comment saying we talked it over so it doesn't look like we just stopped at the disagreement.
[10:57:31] <markelog> ok-ok
[10:57:46] <markelog> but those cases with detached elements are rare
[10:57:49] <markelog> as you said
[10:58:04] <markelog> but they happens a lot more often then first two
[10:58:25] <markelog> like for template engine that could be common 
[10:58:47] <markelog> i remember fixing that bug was my first contrib to jq
[10:59:45] <markelog> and rick help me with it, because we receive similar tickets for it
[10:59:45] <m_gol> hmm, I run markelog's test and jQuery 2 is 2x faster there
[11:00:12] <markelog> in ff?
[11:00:26] <m_gol> Chrome
[11:00:29] <timmywil> ok, so you'd like to see the fix for detached elements stay?
[11:01:08] <markelog> m_gol: it could because page is changing when first dom is hidden
[11:01:19] <markelog> so your position on the page changes
[11:01:25] <m_gol> hmm, ok, the second run is faster in jq#
[11:01:29] <m_gol> * jQ3
[11:01:34] <markelog> you move your window 
[11:01:42] <markelog> and 3.0 is the first test
[11:01:45] <markelog> so it affects 
[11:01:54] <m_gol> yeah, this should be fixed in the test so that it's genuine
[11:01:58] <markelog> timmywil: i'm not sure timmy
[11:02:06] <markelog> i would like to see how people would react
[11:02:23] <markelog> but i do think we should have know about it
[11:02:48] <timmywil> ok, so maybe leave as-is for beta and address before final?
[11:03:21] <markelog> we didn't say anything about perf boost in the post, right?
[11:03:31] <markelog> for show/hide
[11:03:37] <timmywil> I added something about hide, but that's safe, right?
[11:03:47] <timmywil> I didn't say show was faster yet
[11:04:27] <markelog> we would need to specifically test the show()
[11:04:44] <markelog> but i think my perf proves it is
[11:05:17] <timmywil> actually, here's the post https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UcfR24rfK7bFFwlX2-PPjr7MPe6E0aVZ1wfih061INM/edit
[11:05:20] <timmywil> wanna review?
[11:05:21] <m_gol> this https://jsperf.com/old-vs-new-show-hide/4 doesn't jump but first run is still worse in jQ3
[11:05:45] <markelog> timmywil: on it
[11:08:20] <timmywil> Most of it is the same as the alpha except for the intro and the show/hide stuff.
[11:09:24] <markelog> timmywil: i think we could say that show/hide is faster as a whole
[11:09:42] <markelog> but with the trade-off
[11:10:14] <markelog> and would mention something about cases that we are dropping
[11:10:26] <markelog> m_gol: only the first run
[11:10:33] <markelog> for some reason
[11:10:35] <m_gol> yes but most people click once :-)
[11:11:26] <timmywil> markelog: You want to add that?
[11:11:28] <markelog> i'd say most people look at the browser table
[11:12:09] <markelog> i really would, honestly, but i'd need to go to the meeting 
[11:12:23] <markelog> i probably will free up in two hours though
[11:16:23] <m_gol> markelog: the browser table is dead, though. And it would be wrong anyway as it would include both 1st & latter runs
[11:16:37] <m_gol> timmywil: I added some comments to the blog post draft
[11:16:58] <timmywil> m_gol: ok thanks
