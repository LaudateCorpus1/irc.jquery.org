[10:29:39] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: jquery core is passing testswarm? What is this for a strange world.
[10:29:53] <DaveMethvin> no, i don't believe you
[10:29:58] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/projects
[10:30:04] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/552
[10:30:18] <Krinkle> Well, the last run is one without ie6-7-8, but still, nice to see it passing
[10:30:39] <DaveMethvin> well clearly you now have broken it with your upgrade
[10:30:41] <DaveMethvin> :D
[10:30:55] <Krinkle> you mean the opposite
[10:31:12] <DaveMethvin> nope, there's no way that can be right!
[10:31:23] <DaveMethvin> it must not be reporting failures correctly
[10:31:41] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: hehe
[10:44:03] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: jquery.migrate has some failures with jq-git
[10:44:15] <Krinkle> button.attr('value') returns empty string. Expected: 
[10:44:15] <Krinkle> "" Result:	 undefined Diff:  "" undefined 
[10:44:30] <Krinkle> Can you look at that later?
[10:45:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah, there is a twice-weekly job that runs against it so that is my reminder Krinkle
[10:45:52] <DaveMethvin> i'll wait for the swarm site to speed up
[10:46:04] <Krinkle> It has run this one yesterday
[10:46:12] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquerymigrate
[10:46:14] <Krinkle> started 4 days ago
[10:47:03] <DaveMethvin> was it not sending notifications to irc?
[10:47:11] <Krinkle> I don't know
[10:47:15] <Krinkle> I suppse it was
[10:47:40] <DaveMethvin> i'll have to look at it last
[10:47:41] <DaveMethvin> later
[10:47:56] <DaveMethvin> and it runs the job twice a week regardless so if i forget it should remind me

[13:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin kborchers: Repo name?
[13:26:15] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-pointer-events?
[13:26:46] <DaveMethvin> sounds pretty descriptive :)
[13:26:50] <kborchers> screw-you-touch ?
[13:26:56] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:27:18] <kborchers> jquery-pointer-events sounds good
[13:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> I bet snover has some clever touch-condescending name :-)
[13:27:41] <DaveMethvin> well he did come up with jQuery Migrate
[13:28:40] <Krinkle> GitHub always suggests funny names

[13:31:33] <snover> dialing-wand
[13:31:50] <DaveMethvin> STRANGER DANGER!
[13:43:31] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'm headed out but just wanted to confirm ‚Ä¶ you are creating the repo and then do you want me to push the initial commit or are you going to do it?
[13:43:51] <scott_gonzalez> You can push it.
[13:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> I gave you push access.
[13:45:57] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: creative message or just "Initial commit"?
[13:51:11] <scott_gonzalez> I was just do initial commit.
[13:51:25] <scott_gonzalez> But "Fuck you Apple" would be appropriate too.
[14:48:27] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Hehe, I've got a few of those on my name. Different context and I almost forgot about it, but you spelling it out ("Fuck you Apple") made me remember it instantly
[14:48:51] <Krinkle> The Dictionary app used to scrape html using a hacky way of accessing Safari. Breaking in mysterious ways.
[14:49:27] <Krinkle> It extracted part of the html stream, but failing in such a way that if you were logged in in Safari, you'd see a half notifications bar if you have new messages (you can't click it though)
[14:49:35] <Krinkle> and when we switches themes, all hell broke loose.
[14:49:40] <Krinkle> switched*
[14:49:52] <Krinkle> (Wikipedia this is)
[14:50:43] <Krinkle> Worked around by keeping the old theme and triggering it for Dictionary's user agent....
[14:50:50] <Krinkle> I wonder whether they fixed it since.
[14:50:55] <Krinkle> xD
[14:51:01] <Krinkle> (to use the API instead)
