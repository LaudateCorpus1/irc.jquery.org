[04:49:42] <DaveMethvin> ;
[05:52:39] <mikesherov> dearest bot-t, have I any messages?
[05:53:24] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell snover that bot-t doesn't give me any messages even if I ask nicely"
[05:53:25] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[05:53:29] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: no semi's
[05:53:42] <mikesherov> hey gnarf
[05:53:55] <gnarf> hey mikesherov
[05:53:56] <DaveMethvin> ;
[05:54:01] <DaveMethvin> so there
[05:54:02] <mikesherov> I had a quick question, that I'm sure has an easy answer on your PR
[05:54:07] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: did you see scott's gist? :)
[05:54:10] <DaveMethvin> yep
[05:54:31] <gnarf> i was lmao in the airport when i read that shit
[05:54:32] <mikesherov> scott's gist? link please?

[05:54:53] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from k_borchers: LOL! https://t.co/gaYsM9nM Best part is the number of people that think @scott_gonzalez is serious! :D ★ http://bit.ly/HQMd9a
[05:56:29] <scott_gonzalez> Some of the comments make me sad. But I did get to troll someone who trolled someone who didn't get that it was a joke :-)
[05:56:32] <mikesherov> gnarf: in effects.js, why is "clearFxNow" it's own named function? is there a perf hit by inlining it into createFXNow?
[05:57:11] <gnarf> mikesherov: probably not - i don't think it has any use outside that createFxNow
[05:57:43] <gnarf> considering every use of createFxNow is `fxNow || createFxNow()` the perf is negligable
[06:00:06] <mikesherov> there you go, another 5 bytes you can save
[06:00:51] <mikesherov> just inline clearFXNow into the setTimeout
[06:01:57] <mikesherov> on another note, DaveMethvin: isn't it about time we created a setImmediate jQuery function? There are setTimeout(foo, 0); and setTimeout(blah, 1); all over the place
[06:02:31] <DaveMethvin> we had a ticket for that
[06:02:33] <gibson042> jQuery.soon, if I remember correctly, was the ticket for just that
[06:02:43] <mikesherov> ha, jQuery soon
[06:02:51] <mikesherov> or later?
[06:02:58] <gibson042> mmm, might have been
[06:03:00] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.rightQuick
[06:03:33] <gibson042> ah, the blazing performance of bugs.jquery.com
[06:03:34] <DaveMethvin> i was wondering whether we should just use jQuery.setImmediate
[06:03:40] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10417
[06:03:45] <DaveMethvin> blazing, as in the house is burning down
[06:05:41] <gnarf> later
[06:05:42] <gnarf> i thought
[06:06:10] <gnarf> i've been pointing that out since like 1.6
[06:06:27] <gnarf> poor bugs.jquery.com
[06:06:29] <gnarf> hey mikesherov
[06:06:39] <gnarf> i know you expressed an interest in trac setups
[06:06:55] <gnarf> do you think you could help us move trac to a new home?
[06:07:33] <gnarf> and while we're at it see if we can't update package versions along the way too?
[06:20:29] <gnarf> psst...
[06:20:37] <gnarf> whats the email to send the expense report to?
[06:24:48] <scott_gonzalez> We have .delay() in the widget factory.

[09:14:57] <rwaldron> ?test
[09:14:58] <bot-t> (25 hours 4 mins ago) <snover> tell rwaldron Rick has invited you to connect on Masterbranch. Hello! I've registered on Masterbranch, a website for coders to showcase projects and programming skills. This is only for tech people, and I'd like to add you to my network on Masterbranch.
[09:14:58] <bot-t> rwaldron, JQuerySprint/test - The following test pages already exist: http://docs.jquery.com/JQuerySprint/test
[09:15:08] <rwaldron> .
[09:18:13] <jugglinmike> DaveMethvin Hey Dave--are the jQuery unit tests runnable via the web anywhere?
[09:22:07] <gnarf> jugglinmike: like the tests on master?
[09:22:13] <gnarf> jugglinmike: swarm....
[09:22:19] <gnarf> ?swarm
[09:22:19] <bot-t> Swarm Status: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/qunit/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerycolor/ -- Jenkins http://swarm.jquery.org:8080
[09:23:21] <gnarf> jugglinmike: although its kinda dirty: http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery/abd2a07498afa48a4ec3ce0471b9b0b4fc812b55/test/
[09:23:36] <gnarf> jugglinmike: jQuery UI has a "view" script that lets you do it
[09:23:48] <gnarf> we could maybe setup something similar in jQuery too
[09:23:49] <jugglinmike> thanks gnarf! that last link will do I think
[09:24:19] <gnarf> jugglinmike: the only downside is you have to have the commit id
[09:24:45] <gnarf> although http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery/master/test will be the "last commit" that was tested in swarm (which might not actually be master for the case of the 1.8pre branch)
[09:24:52] <jugglinmike> ah right
[09:25:35] <jugglinmike> could you tell me about http://view.jquery.com/ ? because that looks like what I want, but the tests aren't available
[09:26:19] <gnarf> jugglinmike: it probably isn't pulling qunit
[09:26:28] <gnarf> danheberden - who set that one up?
[09:26:33] <gnarf> is that a clarkbox project?
[09:26:45] <gnarf> it needs a git submodule init ; git submodule update
[09:27:15] <danheberden> gnarf wa?
[09:27:18] <danheberden> just gotup
[09:27:22] <gnarf> jugglinmike: but yes - that is what you are looking for, its just not getting its qunit dependencies
[09:27:33] <gnarf> danheberden: view.jquery.com -- its not pulling qunit?
[09:27:36] <gnarf> http://view.jquery.com/master/test/
[09:27:41] <danheberden> yeah, clarkbox set that up
[09:28:11] <danheberden> so we need it to update the submodules too - i think i cna do that
[09:28:13] <danheberden> *can
[09:28:22] <danheberden> not that i'm a python guy, but..
[09:28:52] <gnarf> actually
[09:28:56] <gnarf> it might be doing that already
[09:29:09] <gnarf> seems the "include_js.php" bull is causing issues
[09:30:05] <gnarf> also yeah - http://view.jquery.com/master/test/qunit/ is empty
[09:30:16] <gnarf> danheberden: good luck in there... ;)
[11:51:03] <Jim_> I've updated testswarm and running into a few problems (like user creation), is anyone here familiar with testswarm? The docs included this channel.
[12:20:12] <danheberden> gnarf can you look at the bugs server? for some reason each tracd instance is running at like 1.5 load
[12:20:22] <danheberden> i have no idea why it's running so rough all of a sudden
[12:51:08] <superchu> this channel is strange, yes?
[12:51:57] <ajpiano> ?
[12:52:44] <danheberden> if you consider the execution of bugs strange, then yes
[14:07:41] <gnarf> danheberden: sorry - had  staff meeting
[14:08:01] <gnarf> i'll look after i get back if someone else doesn't beat me to it - i gotta run some errands b4 i head home
[16:07:39] <mikesherov> .
[16:15:43] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: reading through the CCAO stuff
[16:16:29] <mikesherov> maybe I just need to get used to it, but the inline comments are major hindrances to readability. Not sure if there is any other way to accomplish it?
[16:44:51] <gnarf> danheberden: um
[16:44:53] <gnarf> you around?
[16:51:44] <gnarf> I really don't get this
[16:51:59] <gnarf> its like bugs.jquery.com is being DDoS'ed
[16:53:14] <gnarf> aha
[16:53:32] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/14362d68c26e0bcf30a0
[16:55:10] <gnarf> so like all those request are falling down to bugs. and thus causing tracd to go into overtime
[16:55:22] <gnarf> i just 404'ed all requests to /view
[16:55:35] <gnarf> load average falling pretty quick
[17:00:11] <gnarf> danheberden: ^^^^ talk to me about this
[17:01:50] <Krinkle> .
[17:05:27] <gnarf> oh well, that shit has been 404/invalid for a LONG time
[17:05:34] <gnarf> but I assume you 302'ed dev. to bugs.
[17:05:40] <gnarf> so thats why trac suddely picked up all this spam
[17:07:44] <gnarf> nacin: did you ever track down those nginx proxy configs?
[17:17:20] <gnarf> can people test bugs.jquery.com for responsiveness btw? I'm hoping this change has fixed the issue its been having the past day or so
[17:18:02] <ajpiano> seems a lot snappier
[17:25:49] <gnarf> any github admin's floating around?
[17:27:29] <gnarf> oh danheberden - how I wish, how I wish you were here....
[17:36:58] <gnarf> danheberden: telling nginx to just 404 /view URLs seems to have the load average on the trac box under control now
[18:00:23] <rwaldron> I'm probably going to resign from jQuery
[18:00:40] <miketaylr> sorry guys, i stole rwaldron for my open source project
[18:00:43] <rwaldron> -MAX_FUCKING_VALUE to google closure compiler.

[18:01:47] <miketaylr> yeah i've followed some of the emails about CC
[18:02:01] <miketaylr> i've got my suspicions that it's going to make things super complicated
[18:02:44] <rwaldron> same here

[18:03:22] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by dmethvin (3h, 50m ago): Google Closure Compiler CCAO changes
[18:03:29] <rwaldron> too bad i already commented
[18:03:35] <rwaldron> i wanted you to guess what that was
[18:03:41] <DaveMethvin> well that's why i'm not planning to land it on master for 1.8
[18:04:06] <DaveMethvin> i want to see if anyone will use it
[18:04:13] <miketaylr> sweet sed in ur js
[18:04:53] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin does that mean you're not going to land it on 1.8pre either?
[18:05:05] <DaveMethvin> i wasn't planning to, no
[18:05:14] <DaveMethvin> it was just rebased against 1.8pre
[18:05:14] <rwaldron> good to know
[18:05:24] <rwaldron> I won't be resigning for now
[18:05:25] <rwaldron> ;)
[18:05:30] <DaveMethvin> lol
[18:05:40] <DaveMethvin> it is a mess
[18:05:51] <DaveMethvin> mainly just too complex
[18:05:55] <rwaldron> agreed
[18:06:12] <DaveMethvin> i don't like the jsdoc comments at all
[18:06:22] <rwaldron> I feel like we would need a member of closure library to review everything we added to library
[18:06:27] <rwaldron> at least for quite some time
[18:06:34] <rwaldron> until we figured it out
[18:06:47] <rwaldron> also, agreed on disliking the jsdoc comments
[18:06:57] <rwaldron> bums me out when there is more comment then code
[18:07:10] <rwaldron> i understand realy good, explanatory "why" comments
[18:07:17] <rwaldron> really*
[18:07:28] <rwaldron> but this is like... boilerplate overkill
[18:07:36] <DaveMethvin> yep ... the minimally invasive stuff we could land, but i want to have the jsdoc and crazy changes in a ccao branch
[18:08:11] <DaveMethvin> it just seems like if we are having problems getting into ccao that very few of our users will go through the trouble
[18:08:28] <DaveMethvin> and i don't want ppl blaming us when their own code doesn't pass ccao
[18:08:35] <DaveMethvin> which i think will happen quite often
[18:09:31] <rwaldron> same here
[18:09:41] <rwaldron> and debugging will be a nightmare
[18:09:46] <rwaldron> basically we wont be able to
[18:10:04] <rwaldron> then people will be upset that we dnt help with their CCAO/jQuery issues
[18:10:05] <miketaylr> does this actually make the lib smaller?
[18:10:12] <rwaldron> it might
[18:10:20] <rwaldron> if you used jQuery for like...
[18:10:38] <rwaldron> $(function() { $("thingy").show(); })
[18:10:47] <rwaldron> it would rip out almost all of the library
[18:10:56] <rwaldron> but then if you added code
[18:11:01] <rwaldron> you'd have to recompile
[18:11:17] <rwaldron> with all of your own code included, so that CCAO know what to cut
[18:11:32] <rwaldron> also, if you have plugins, those have to be bundled into the build as well
[18:11:38] <miketaylr> adios to shared google ajax lib cache
[18:11:51] <miketaylr> (nvm, if you're adding code)
[18:12:01] <DaveMethvin> exactly, it defn would make a large app smaller if everything worked with ccao but you'd have to host the resulting lump yourself
[18:12:08] <rwaldron> but this would be like, an "option"
[18:12:21] <rwaldron> not the standard build
[18:12:30] <rwaldron> all of the regular jQuery stuff would still exist
[18:12:43] <miketaylr> sounds like fun!
[18:12:50] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron ... alternatives
[18:12:50] <miketaylr> DaveMethvin: you should aks for a raise
[18:12:56] <miketaylr> s/aks/ask/
[18:13:02] <rwaldron> my issue is that maintaining regs jQuery is severely and negatively impacted by CCAO annotation
[18:13:12] <DaveMethvin> i want my pay doubled! 2*0
[18:13:26] <rwaldron> +2^32
[18:13:32] <miketaylr> gotta market more aggressivly for jquery foundation membership!
[18:13:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah, how about those opera deadbeats? we have a special sponsor level
[18:14:16] <miketaylr> man, don't get me started
[18:14:42] <DaveMethvin> tell em we promise not to spend more than half on hookers and blow
[18:14:59] <miketaylr> i personally think it's weird for browser vendors to sponsor js libs
[18:15:10] <miketaylr> the good news, i don't make these decisions ^_^
[18:15:26] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron ... how about we refactor the existing code to make it possible to leave parts out?
[18:15:36] <DaveMethvin> that would beat ccao for most users
[18:16:08] <danzik17> just lurking, but why not go the AMD/requirejs route - then you could still provide the built file, kind of like what jqm does
[18:16:17] <rwaldron> I'd be more interested in that then anything
[18:16:54] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^^ (sorry, not danzik17)
[18:17:02] <danzik17> :(
[18:18:37] <ajpiano> wow,
[18:18:48] <ajpiano> someone in #jquery is whinging about the fact that "rwldrn is spamming the jquery github feed"
[18:19:06] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately, all those comments DO fill the feed
[18:19:14] <DaveMethvin> i think there were 29
[18:23:47] <rwaldron> i was conservative
[18:23:51] <rwaldron> that code is fucked.
[18:24:01] <rwaldron> like..
[18:24:32] <ajpiano> rwaldron: don't sweat that dude, it's like the opposite of a big deal
[18:24:36] <rwaldron> jQuery.extend( obj, ({ "yes": "unnec. grouping parens" }));
[18:24:49] <rwaldron> ajpiano i'm not
[18:24:58] <rwaldron> my time in #jquery is drawing to a close
[18:24:59] <ajpiano> i also don't think we should land this ccao thing
[18:30:55] <DaveMethvin> per the meeting notes this week, it's staying in a branch
[18:31:13] <DaveMethvin> but we need it to be in good enough shape for people to experiment with
[18:46:31] <gnarf> i wonder if we could recruit someone to be responsible for testing that and keeping it based on 1.8pre
[18:53:13] <gnarf> rwaldron: i stood up for you in #jquery to that foo
[18:56:55] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: will there be a blog post for people to let them know its there to experiment with?
[18:57:25] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: sure, but probably not until close to the release
[18:57:41] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we'll try to keep it in sync during development
[18:57:43] <DaveMethvin> it's a lot of work
[18:57:53] <paul_irish> ya
[18:58:14] <paul_irish> would a snapshot of it now be useful?
[18:58:48] <DaveMethvin> i dunno, it has to be synchronized with some sizzle changes that haven't been committed
[18:58:56] <DaveMethvin> so probably not
[18:59:04] <DaveMethvin> plus the build needs to be switch to grunt
[18:59:05] <DaveMethvin> etc
[19:15:06] <gnarf> WTB danheberden!
