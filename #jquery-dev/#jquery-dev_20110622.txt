[00:36:55] <alystair> Why aren't css hooks for the various css3 built-in to jquery? Eg. css3 transition and transforms are pretty much the same thing between all latest browsers
[00:37:19] <alystair> wasn't one of the goals for jQ to normalize the development platform between browsers or am I mistaken
[07:04:56] <ajpiano> did anyone ever reply to alystair
[07:04:57] <ajpiano> lol
[07:06:09] <rwaldron_> I mailed him/her a slap in the face
[07:06:36] <ajpiano> lol
[07:06:44] <ajpiano> as much as like
[07:06:51] <ajpiano> jquery is a cross browser js lib
[07:07:22] <ajpiano> it's really annoying when people use that as the main weight behind the  "why don't you support X" question
[07:07:46] <rwaldron_> I've modified my response language in the last month or so
[07:07:51] <rwaldron_> I now say "we do!"
[07:08:00] <rwaldron_> and point them to [whatever]Hooks
[07:08:01] <ajpiano> for transitions/transforms?
[07:08:03] <rwaldron_> :D
[07:08:10] <ajpiano> yea, link to louisremi's thing is useful
[07:08:14] <rwaldron_> and i encourage them to write their own support
[07:08:18] <rwaldron_> and that too
[07:08:24] <rwaldron_> i mean this on a broader level
[07:08:58] <rwaldron_> for all silly requests that say "orange-u s'posed-ta be cross-browsie??"
[07:09:24] <ajpiano> yah
[07:09:32] <rwaldron_> c'mon... that was funny

[13:06:46] <timmywil> the success message for the boston conference speaker form needs an update: "Thank you for submitting your talk proposal for the San Francisco Bay Area Conference. "
[14:04:41] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[14:04:50] <rwaldron> i dont want to add even more shit to jQuery.browser
[14:05:02] <rwaldron> i answered the ticket to the letter
[14:05:09] <rwaldron> as much as i disagreed with it
[14:17:54] <timmywil> rwaldron: oh i know, I just wasn't in on the discussion so I was voicing my opinion
[14:18:44] <timmywil> wasn't particulary directed at you
[14:18:55] <rwaldron> i didnt think it was
[14:19:18] <rwaldron> i was just clarifying that under no circumstance do i tihnk we should do anything more then what the ticket requests
[14:20:04] <timmywil> yea, it's just the argument behind adding support for sniffing chrome breaks down if we're not also sniffing safari
[14:20:48] <rwaldron> super lame.
