[03:25:07] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15abody opened pull request #1057: Replaced `typeof` check in line 28 with a more efficient alternative (06master...06patch-1)  02http://git.io/3uFzZg
[04:23:35] <Krinkle> mikesherov: Can you revert 228ab3d and friends? jaubourg will have to make PR instead. That commit is broken from all angles.
[04:31:19] <jaubourg> thank you for keeping it in and let me fix it. Thanks also for the multiple review
[04:58:46] <ravenzz> hello there folks
[05:00:20] <ravenzz> is there any good reason why a datepicker binded to a date input doesn't work?
[05:02:20] <ravenzz> bound*
[05:12:26] <Krinkle> jaubourg: excuse me?
[05:15:15] <Krinkle> jaubourg: I intend to send my fix up to your PR, not to jquery/master. Unless someone else fixes up master before that (in which case I"m doing this for nothing)
[05:19:11] <Krinkle> jaubourg: I'd rather not reach out to someone else and fix this with you. Can you revert this rewrite and submit it as a PR?
[05:19:44] <Krinkle> It will probably take 2 or 3 more commits before it works properly 
[05:20:14] <Krinkle> given the time it takes to merge PRs, probably another day etc.
[05:20:32] <jaubourg> Krinkle: I'm sorry but you seem very aggressive in the matter. I'm willing to work on this and fix it. I wasn't aware of any PHP code style guide and I just assumed too much regarding 301 redirections + a silly silly security hiccup. I'm willing to fix these and was asking for guidance. This should all take me a mere hour. I never asked you to fix all this for me.
[05:20:48] <Krinkle> This is not about the coding style and not about the directory indexes.
[05:21:16] <jaubourg> What is it about then?
[05:21:17] <Krinkle> I know you didn't ask me, but since you committed it to master with other problems and maskings, and you asked me for review.
[05:21:21] <Krinkle> just a moment
[05:22:57] <Krinkle> so I review it, but in trying to find those issues I'm right at the code. Solving it is another second of the 3 minutes spent on that. I'm fixing it not because I don't want you to, but because it makes sense to not have to have 2 people go all over it.
[05:23:26] <Krinkle> the other issues are explained in the other dozen comments on that commit (still writing them in finding more issues as I go through)
[05:23:38] <jaubourg> Oh, got you but I'm really sorry, I didn't want you to take more work on your shoulders
[05:23:54] <Krinkle> no work at all, I enjoy doing review and documentation.
[05:24:44] <Krinkle> the coding style doesn't affect anything serious, and the directory issue is only on swarm (it uses nginx, I presume you use apache, like I do, since I couldn't reproduce it locally)
[05:25:35] <jaubourg> As for the process, that's something I always intended to fix in master and be done with it. I didn't want to clobber the PR queue and add noise for everyone while I'm convinced this (non-critical as in not the lib proper) patch can be fixed in place.
[05:25:43] <jaubourg> yes, I'm using apache
[05:26:05] <jaubourg> what I don't get though is that I don't have errors showing up even if I use E_ALL and display_errors
[05:26:31] <jaubourg> no idea why my PHP install is acting like it does and it worries me because I don't do just jQuery PHP work :/
[05:28:08] <Krinkle> well, I'm actually of opinion that we should (within a few months) socially lock direct pushes completely. Regardless of whether it is a test fix, readme or a trailing comma.
[05:28:40] <Krinkle> so that any commit goes in PR, gets mergeatron tests ran, and then (preferably but not required)  after human review, merged.
[05:29:26] <Krinkle> as for not being critical, I'm obviously biased since this area is my job, but I do think it is important.
[05:29:35] <Krinkle> because nobody can use mergatron or jenkins now for jquery commits
[05:29:47] <Krinkle> not pushes , not PRs
[05:30:03] <Krinkle> lots of wasted browserstack workers for re-running known to be broken tests etc.
[05:30:07] <Krinkle> all those IE6 kittens :P
[05:31:09] <jaubourg> I hear you but direct pushes are useful for a lot of situations, though I hear you wth mergatron. Can we use it on branches? Would be awesome if we could test a branch even before opening a PR. I use branches on the main repo to create mine.
[05:31:38] <Krinkle> PRs can be for branches within a repo too
[05:31:39] <jaubourg> damn, didn't know I would break everything that bad :(
[05:31:43] <Krinkle> and yes, it can (and already does) run on branches too
[05:32:06] <Krinkle> not any branch, but it can be whitelisted
[05:32:14] <jaubourg> nice
[05:32:17] <Krinkle> we could make branch *, but there may be some branches not passing. good idea!
[05:32:25] <Krinkle> right now I think it is master|1.8pre
[05:32:27] <Krinkle> or was anyway
[05:32:54] <jaubourg> again, I'm sorry if I made you life a little harder here... I tested everything on browserstack on all supported browsers, hence why I just pushed it :(
[05:33:11] <Krinkle> yeah
[05:33:15] <Krinkle> I can see how it happens
[05:33:32] <jaubourg> the PHP not reporting errors is a big issue on my side though
[05:33:55] <Krinkle> but still, could you back it out for now and submit those 3 commits in a branch in your (or jquerys) repo, and create a PR?
[05:34:11] <jaubourg> it is set to... but it doesn't report "hello[world]" problems
[05:34:33] <jaubourg> Isn't it simpler to just make a PR on master?
[05:34:42] <Krinkle> Whatever works for you.
[05:35:15] <jaubourg> I mean, the thing is in master anyway already, let's fix the bugger and I'll know better than doing this ever again :/
[05:35:50] <Krinkle> well, I'm gonna leave for a few hours in a bit, then someone will review my fix (since I don't have nor want push access), and merge it. That's up to another day. And it's already been a day.
[05:36:25] <Krinkle> jaubourg: it's just a unit test right? so no urge in keeping it now, so that other peopls commits will pass (that way I can also tell if any of the commits since introduced regressions)
[05:37:02] <jaubourg> got you, so I would create a branch, push it remotely, then go back to master and revert?
[05:37:33] <jaubourg> <= not a git magician
[05:38:00] <Krinkle> hm.. lets see. There've been a few commits in between, so using the current HEAD master as the base for your PR wouldn't work.
[05:38:21] <Krinkle> undo those 3 commits in master, push those, then create a branch from that new master, cherry-pick those 3 commits back on, and push that as a PR.
[05:39:54] <jaubourg> I have no clue how to revert yet keep the commits some place, that's the thing
[05:40:08] <Krinkle> git-revert is the inverse of cherry-pick
[05:40:16] <Krinkle> All you need is the SHA1 as ID.
[05:40:29] <Krinkle> They'll stay in the history so you don't have to keep them anywhere.
[05:40:53] <Krinkle> and you can copy-paste the hash from github as well if you prefer not to use git-log to figure out the ID.
[05:42:43] <Krinkle> there's copy hash buttons on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits/master), you'd take the 3 for this topic (228ab3d, 2a419a7e8, 20608b3). git-revert those on master, push to jquery/jquery, then in your own fork or topic branch, cherry-pick them back on and PR.
[05:42:54] <jaubourg> So once it's reverted, it's still there? How to I re-commit a reverted one in a branch then? Sorry to be a pain in the ass. Just don't wanna lose 2 days of work :/
[05:43:19] <Krinkle> you don't re-commit them. You re-apply the original commit.
[05:43:32] <jaubourg> I just cancel the revert?
[05:43:44] <Krinkle> every commit has an ID. you can use it to git-show, git-cherry-pick or git-revert it from any point in time.
[05:44:17] <Krinkle> with git cherry-pick <id> (after the revert) you simulate the original commit exactly as it was on top of the current state.
[05:44:24] <jaubourg> ok, I'll try that then
[05:44:47] <Krinkle> I've only switched to git from svn last year, but I guess I'm a natural, I always struggled with svn.
[05:45:19] <jaubourg> never liked any repo system... it always seems overly convoluted to me

[06:01:13] <jaubourg> Krinkle: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1058
[06:01:14] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by jaubourg ( ago): No Ticket: Rationalize PHP scripts for ajax unit tests
[06:01:58] <Krinkle> jaubourg: thx, looks good.
[06:02:59] <jaubourg> wasn't that complicated after all
[06:03:19] <jaubourg> so you can PR on the ajax-unit branch if you want to ;)
[06:07:32] <jaubourg> rwaldron: regarding the tweet, is it that you'd want a serializeJSON?
[06:14:44] <Krinkle> jaubourg: okay, will do. thanks.
[06:47:49] <Krinkle> jaubourg: found in my notes from a few months ago how I re-enabled php error_reporting after updating OSX (which nuked my php.ini, since then  I also switched to keeping it in a different locatio)
[06:48:45] <Krinkle> jaubourg: in php.ini: error_reporting = E_ALL
[06:48:46] <Krinkle> display_errors = On
[06:48:51] <Krinkle> display_startup_errors = On 
[06:49:09] <Krinkle> by default apache will also catch those and log them to /var/log/apache2/error_log
[06:49:17] <Krinkle> (mixed with other language errors)
[06:49:54] <Krinkle> if you want them in a dedicated file as well (I personally stopped doing that)  set error_log = /tmp/php_error_log and log_errors = On
[06:50:43] <Krinkle> In production (on testswarm) display_errors is Off and logs to a file instead.
[06:51:23] <Krinkle> to verify it uses that php.ini file, put <? phpinfo(); in a file and open it, cmd+F for ".ini" and you'll find it
[06:52:05] <jaubourg> ok, I use wamp locally and I have all of this set properly... but I also have 3 diff versions of php so I'm never sure which file is which :/
[06:52:25] <jaubourg> I'll check the phpinfo to make sure
[06:56:49] <ravenzz> where I can file a bug?
[06:56:57] <ravenzz> it's my first time ^^
[06:57:45] <scott_gonzalez> ravenzz: bugs.jquery.com
[06:58:01] <scott_gonzalez> Make sure to include a link to a reduced test case. You can use jsFiddle or jsbin.
[06:58:15] <scott_gonzalez> Just read the big red box :-)
[06:58:28] <ravenzz> sure
[06:58:50] <jaubourg> and search the database first ;)
[06:58:55] <ravenzz> oh maybe it was already reported
[06:58:57] <ravenzz> yep
[06:59:13] <ravenzz> it is about slideDown that sets overflow: hidden;
[06:59:26] <ravenzz> is there any reason why would it do that?
[06:59:30] <jaubourg> I seem to remember something like that
[07:00:03] <ravenzz> my element has overflow-y: auto;
[07:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> ravenzz: Are you talking about during the animation or after it finishes?
[07:00:36] <ravenzz> and the inline hidden, which is more specific, will ovewrite it
[07:00:36] <jaubourg> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12854
[07:00:38] <ravenzz> scott_gonzalez after
[07:00:48] <jaubourg> ravenzz: related?
[07:00:54] <ravenzz> let me check
[07:01:34] <ravenzz> uhm not really, let me prepare a testcase
[07:01:42] <jaubourg> look the last comment
[07:01:48] <ravenzz> 1 sec
[07:03:19] <ravenzz> alright but where it defines shrinkWrapBlocks ?
[07:10:47] <ravenzz> on jsFiddle I don't experience this issue, typical
[07:10:52] <jaubourg> in support.js
[07:10:54] <ravenzz> nvm I'll investigate further
[07:11:08] <Krinkle> ravenzz: the test case only has to show what you do, no need to dive in the source code for shrinkWrapBlocks yet (unless you want to ofcourse!)
[07:11:16] <jaubourg> probably some css shenanigan some place?
[07:11:35] <Krinkle> ravenzz: nice, I know the feeling when "it works on jsFiddle, but at least you've 
[07:11:35] <ravenzz> eh the thing is that overflow: hidden is inline :|
[07:11:39] <ravenzz> so it is not my fault
[07:11:46] <Krinkle> ravenzz: nice, I know the feeling when "it works on jsFiddle", but at least you've got something to work from now :) 
[07:12:05] <jaubourg> ravenzz: never said it was ;)
[07:12:17] <ravenzz> I don't have any inline css :)
[07:13:49] <ravenzz> actually "it is"
[07:14:03] <ravenzz> jaubourg you were correct, it is related to box-sizing
[07:14:44] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/hKFJp/ http://jsfiddle.net/hKFJp/1/
[07:14:51] <jaubourg> I just searched the bug database, you did the job of confirming it was related ;)
[07:23:56] <ravenzz> is there any better workaround than this: slideToggle(function () { $(this).css("overflow-y", "auto" }); ?
[07:49:33] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: any  idea what to do about browserstack? IE7 and Safari 6 are still massively failwhaleing
[07:50:11] <Krinkle> jenkins queue is up to 3 hours, especially due to big jquery ui test suites which are all waiting for IE7 and Safari 6 (which isn't happening much)
[07:50:15] <Krinkle> so they time out after 30 minutes
[07:52:18] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: turn of IE7 and Safari 6 for our active browserSets and add a test job with just those two, and give that to the BrowserStack guys?
[07:53:13] <Krinkle> gnarf: any news yet? I don't want to do something if you're already doing it
[07:53:29] <Krinkle> it seemed like you were on to something
[07:54:57] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: seemed like you could just take over what gnarf offered?
[07:55:03] <Krinkle> sure
[07:55:42] <gnarf> Krinkle: he pinged me once in gchat but we missed each other
[07:55:48] <Krinkle> ok
[07:55:59] <Krinkle> gnarf: what about timezone availability, is yours better than mine?
[07:56:07] <Krinkle> if so, I can set it up now and send you two the link
[07:56:21] <gnarf> but please, offer up your own gchat - it would be better to have more than one of us have a browserstack guy on gchat, and it makes even more sense for you to be one of those guys :)
[07:56:36] <Krinkle> alrighty :)
[08:13:57] <Krinkle> gnarf: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/tmp (sending password per email, which you need to login to testswarm and reset the job at will)
[08:14:12] <Krinkle> .. which will make testswarm-browserstack deamon spawn the relevant browsers within a few seconds
[08:24:05] <rwaldron> jaubourg huh? no
[08:24:19] <jaubourg> k
[08:24:44] <rwaldron> for the same reason we don't roll-in html5shim

[08:46:55] <Krinkle> thought I'd share it with you now to look at as well.
[08:48:11] <Krinkle> jaubourg: I suspect you might have magic_quotes enabled (been deprecated for a long time), if so I'd recommend you disable it. Either way, the script now detects it and decodes them only if magic quotes is enabled.
[08:48:18] <Krinkle> this caused some of the \" bugs
[08:48:30] <Krinkle> (unexpected parserror) for xml
[08:49:01] <Krinkle> I don't think I left a comment about that issue, that was another major thing that caused about 5/12 errors on testswarm
[08:49:17] <Krinkle> the xml string wasn't roundtripping properly as PHP magic quotes would quote a bunch of stuff
[08:56:38] <ajpiano> lol holy commit message batman
[08:57:38] <Krinkle> W.i.p.
[09:02:59] <snover> magic quotes, really :(
[09:12:17] <Krinkle> unfortunately yes.
[09:12:27] <Krinkle> it is still enabled by default on some web servers.
[09:12:52] <Krinkle> It was enabled on PHP 5.3.x even (the php.ini that shipped with Mac OS X)
[09:14:28] <Krinkle> gnarf: (from -meeting) yes, by all means in that case. Just making sure people don't leave it idling in the background, as that won't work/scale.
[09:14:29] <snover> um. not on my mac
[09:14:36] <Krinkle> gnarf: but quick catching up is cool
[09:14:39] <Krinkle> (I do it too)
[09:14:45] <Krinkle> snover: snow leopard
[09:15:08] <Krinkle> snover: anyhow, whatever :) disable if you can
[09:15:13] <gnarf> Krinkle: yeah - its way useful to have that run url in the hands of people who can notice the backlog / attack it when it happens
[09:15:14] <Krinkle> either way, its covered now
[09:15:29] <gnarf> i mean it doesn't take much to click in a window occasioanlly to defeat the timer, or restart it if it times out
[09:15:36] <Krinkle> sure
[09:15:45] <gnarf> i just got that "error connecting to server" again (timeout???)
[09:17:32] <Krinkle> no, busy server and slow query
[09:17:40] <Krinkle> still haven't found the query of doom yet (or forgot about it)
[09:17:48] <Krinkle> its a lot rarer now, but not defeated yet
[09:23:46] <Krinkle> gnarf: btw, in case you're on a recent Mac system (I forgot what you ran), Safari 6 actually, you know, is natively available.
[09:23:54] * Krinkle just realised (DUH!)
[09:24:16] <gnarf> Krinkle: yeah it is, but it doesn't stay "in focus" when i tab around, easier to just launch a browserstack
[09:24:32] <Krinkle> ah, good point. jquery ui needs focus
[09:24:39] <Krinkle> this is among the reasons we restricted the swarm
[09:24:58] <gnarf> core selectors has a few too
[09:25:08] <Krinkle> (and why handing out tokens needs to be with care and a warning)
[09:25:14] <gnarf> anything that uses :focus is susceptible to the issues
[09:25:28] <Krinkle> though I believe only IE7 is subject to those :focus bugs
[09:25:40] <gnarf> chrome actually
[09:25:41] <Krinkle> afaik webkit and gecko handle that fine when triggered from javascript in an inactive tab
[09:25:42] <gnarf> and safari
[09:25:46] <gnarf> and firefox
[09:25:50] <gnarf> old ie's handled it okay
[09:25:55] <gnarf> new ie's don;t
[09:25:59] <gnarf> it was upside down 
[09:26:20] <gnarf> if a browser tab isn't focused, :focus doesn't apply with qSA engines it seems
[09:26:23] <Krinkle> I don't remember it being the way I just described in mediawiki's tests with :focus and text selection.
[09:26:27] <Krinkle> but I believe you.
[09:26:41] <Krinkle> I do*
[09:27:19] <gnarf> whatever it was - it was black magic voodoo *shakes a stick*

[11:12:58] <gibson042> what's the estimated time remaining on ECTD-5770Create and unit test BLL method: DSF/RESPONSE_POOL_DETAIL ?
[11:13:33] <gibson042> ack, n/m
[11:20:43] <ajpiano> lol
[12:55:21] <guy> I asked this in #jquery, though #jquery-dev is probably more adequate: "this" in this context refers to the object rather than the selected element, is there a way to obtain the original reference? https://gist.github.com/b7fb656c037f27d02a4e
[13:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> guy: That's not how jQuery works. And #jquery is the correct place.
