[08:22:45] <DaveMethvin> whatsup m_gol 
[08:23:32] <m_gol> I wanted to ask timmywil but he's not here; I assume I'm fine to move 3.0.1 to 3.1.1 & 3.1.0 to 3.2.0 and tag the issue for the ready exception PR as in the 3.1.0 milestone?
[08:25:04] <m_gol> ^ DaveMethvin
[08:25:13] <DaveMethvin> i forget, which bug was the one that 3.0.1 was gonna fix?
[08:25:47] <m_gol> there are a couple
[08:26:05] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+milestone%3A3.0.1
[08:26:16] <m_gol> just things that made sense for the next patch release
[08:27:03] <m_gol> but they should wait for 3.1.1 now that we're planning a quick 3.1.0 with the jQuery.readyException fix/feature
[08:27:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah sounds good to me
[08:27:34] <DaveMethvin> i was confused about 3.0.1 vs 3.1.0
[08:37:07] <m_gol> ok, done
