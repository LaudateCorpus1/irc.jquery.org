[08:13:37] <Rainb> I was reading jQuery source code when I found this on jQuery,each.  "for ( ; i < length; )" I want to know why they used this for loop instead of "while(i<length)"
[08:13:58] <Rainb> jQuery.each*
[08:36:51] <JamesMGreene> So jzaefferer, why would we want to _not_ auto-expand the tests with failures anyway...?
[08:36:56] <JamesMGreene> (re: QUnit Composite)
[08:37:12] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery 1.x Core build #52: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%201.x%20Core/52/

[08:37:13] <doesallmagic> * dave.methvin: Fix #13355. Tweak Uglify options and var order for gzip. Close gh-1151.
[08:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: Because you shouldn't be debugging in a composite suite. You should debug in the actual test file that has failures.
[08:38:47] <JamesMGreene> Hmm
[08:39:00] <JamesMGreene> But I still want to see what failed without having to re-run the whole suite
[08:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> So you can expand if you want, but I don't think that should be the default behavior.
[08:39:29] <gnarf> jzaefferer: re this recursion thing - there are some assertions where it fails https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/test/deepEqual.js#L1380
[08:39:41] <gnarf> i think i have a way to fix that tho
[08:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> When I run a composite suite, I want to see the big picture.
[08:39:50] <JamesMGreene> Isn't expansion the default for every other reported result in QUnit, though? :-\
[08:39:50] <scott_gonzalez> Expanding makes that really hard.
[08:40:01] <JamesMGreene> I suppose so
[08:40:18] <JamesMGreene> I think just fixing the inline style vs. CSS class discrepancy is good enough for me
[08:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that should be fixed.
[08:40:40] <JamesMGreene> Will do
[08:41:25] <JamesMGreene> So, jzaefferer: `QUnit["stay-off-my-lawn"].registerCallback(...)`? LOL
[08:41:36] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: sounds good. Let me know about the register/run callbacks stuff, just make something up and send a PR?
[08:41:44] <JamesMGreene> lol
[08:42:02] <JamesMGreene> I guess I'm not sure what you're OK with exposing
[08:43:05] <JamesMGreene> I wouldn't necessarily even need to add new logging events
[08:43:33] <JamesMGreene> I really just need to be able to append a property into the data that gets passed to the `testStart`/`testDone` callbacks
[08:44:02] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: can you hack something together and share that? I think that would help a lot
[08:44:03] <JamesMGreene> Any obscure way to do that currently?
[08:46:03] <JamesMGreene> Yeah I guess
[08:46:14] <JamesMGreene> Looked at the code, doesn't look like any backdoor way to achieve that right now
[08:46:27] <JamesMGreene> (we're just making object literals in the immediate call)
[08:47:50] <JamesMGreene> I'm just not sure where I'd shim the data in
[08:48:12] <JamesMGreene> Seems like it would have to be on the `asyncTest` call but that seems nasty
[08:49:24] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez Thoughts on leaving the Composite iframes around so you can view the actual results without having to (a) re-run the whole suite or (b) deducing what bits of the prefix correlate to pages vs. modules vs. tests, etc.?
[08:50:01] <JamesMGreene> Meaning using the actual iframes to display the results rather than rolling them up with prefixed messages

[09:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: That seems fine.
[09:03:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez mikesherov gibson042 ^^^ that circular reference logic seem sane?
[09:04:14] <gnarf> i figured if they are both circular to the same point in their tree, or one is circular, and they are equal, it should be equal
[09:05:32] <JamesMGreene> OK, thanks
[09:08:12] <gibson042> gnarf: it's pretty dense, but that looks right to me
[09:09:50] <gnarf> cool
[09:16:45] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: after the latest suggestion here https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1140#issuecomment-12950231 i almost want to merge it - tiny impact for bit of safety?
[09:16:45] <b-ot> gnarf: Pull request #1140 by andrewplummer (1w 2d ago): 1.9 stable sugar fix 265
[09:17:03] <DaveMethvin> agreed, that's not a lot of change at this point
[09:17:29] <gnarf> I think I'll just make the change by hand and give him author
[09:17:40] <DaveMethvin> probably easier since it's just changing two lines
[09:17:52] <gnarf> you like his test case?
[09:17:53] <DaveMethvin> but he'll need to sign the CLA if he hasn't
[09:17:54] <DaveMethvin> let me check
[09:18:24] <gnarf> it seems too complex
[09:18:36] <DaveMethvin> nope, he hasn't signed yet
[09:18:47] <DaveMethvin> on test cases, the simpler the better since this is pretty rare
[09:18:50] <gnarf> I'll poke him
[09:18:54] <DaveMethvin> i don't want a complex bunch of changes
[09:19:03] <gnarf> yeah
[09:19:07] <DaveMethvin> thanks, we'll make him happy
[09:19:08] <gnarf> when are we doing 1.9.1 ?
[09:19:16] <DaveMethvin> um, tomorrow?
[09:19:22] <DaveMethvin> still have a few tix to deal with

[10:51:10] <DaveMethvin> if you sign the jQuery Foundation CLA you're covered for all projects

[10:57:41] <JamesMGreene> I don't believe I have signed any

[11:04:38] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: Good point. I never bother asking QUnit contributors to sign the CLA, need to start doing that. Along with checking past contributors.

[12:16:03] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I'm not sure I follow, I'd rather avoid more personally selected add-ons in the repo. 
[12:16:06] <Krinkle> More modular instead
[12:16:10] <Krinkle> (like grunt did)
[12:16:14] <Krinkle> not bringing in more
[12:16:43] <Krinkle> using submodules or npm should be an acceptable method and something the developer should be able to understand and use.
[12:16:52] <Krinkle> especially considering it isn't production but testing.
[12:17:07] <Krinkle> though even then, jquery plugins are separate too.
[12:17:46] <Krinkle> I'd rather move things out (though we shouldn't do that yet to avoid breaking compatibility and path errors).

[18:58:50] <mikesherov> yes, on target
[18:58:57] <DaveMethvin> that's the kind of meany i am :)
[18:59:08] <mikesherov> just digging up of an overwhelming mountain of work at work past couple of weeks
[18:59:09] <DaveMethvin> we need to get a 1.9.1 out here soon
[18:59:15] <mikesherov> yeah, I agree
[18:59:22] <DaveMethvin> just to eliminate all the dups
[18:59:35] <mikesherov> Which is why I said "someone please take it if I can't"
[18:59:47] <mikesherov> but I'll make sure it's addressed
[18:59:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think eeryone else is slammed too
[19:00:04] <DaveMethvin> several nasty sizzle issues
[19:00:27] <mikesherov> yeah
[19:00:32] <mikesherov> I was reading
[19:00:36] <mikesherov> then my head hurt
[19:00:54] <DaveMethvin> focus issues on firefox, node ordering on chrome
[19:01:11] <DaveMethvin> i mean, i thought WE had focus problems
[19:01:19] <mikesherov> every focus issue scares me
[19:01:26] <DaveMethvin> there are SO MANY focus bugs at the firefox site, and they're OLD
[19:02:04] <mikesherov> yeah, I mean, i cringe when our bug tracker gets over 100
[19:02:12] <mikesherov> the firefox tracker is literally insanity
[19:02:22] <DaveMethvin> they need a snover-pass
[19:02:28] <mikesherov> haha
[19:02:46] <mikesherov> what they NEED is a ticketgraph
[19:02:53] <mikesherov> that's all it takes and then I'm hooked
[19:03:07] <DaveMethvin> i think they would be depressed
[19:03:16] <DaveMethvin> but you just know a lot fo them are dups
[19:03:34] <DaveMethvin> plus they don't seem to close tickets very aggressivly

[21:27:13] <JamesMGreene> Say question for you
[21:27:32] <JamesMGreene> So as I'm cleaning up the various QUnit addons, would you prefer incremental PRs?
[21:28:00] <JamesMGreene> I'm assuming so
[21:28:15] <JamesMGreene> but just wanted to check before I end up creating several staggered PRs
[21:32:15] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle?

[21:54:06] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Separate commits is most important
[21:54:14] <Krinkle> how many PRs I don't really care
[21:54:20] <Krinkle> we can merge separately or at once
[21:54:32] <Krinkle> I'd say make them atomic changes in separate local branchces
[21:54:40] <Krinkle> so they'll naturally end up as separate PRs
