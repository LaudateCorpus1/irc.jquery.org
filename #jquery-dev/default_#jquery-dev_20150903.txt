[07:42:13] <JamesMGreene> Core folks or anything else in the know: what's the short list of property names required to make the browser treat jQuery sets like an array?
[07:42:30] <JamesMGreene> Just `length`? Or more?
[07:43:08] <JamesMGreene> I see the latest includes the following property names that overlap with Arrays: length, push, sort, splice, slice, map
[07:54:21] <dcherman> JamesMGreene: if you mean make it display as an array in the console, then i think it's the presence of `length` and `splice`
[07:54:39] <JamesMGreene> dcherman: yeah, that's what I meant, sorry
[07:56:08] <JamesMGreene> indeed seems to be the case in Chrome anyway :)
