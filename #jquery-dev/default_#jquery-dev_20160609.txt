[10:30:37] <m_gol> timmywil: maybe I'll merge the jquery-3 branch on jquery.com to master now?
[10:30:45] <m_gol> just without releasing it yet
[10:30:54] <m_gol> i.e. without tagging
[10:31:03] <timmywil> no worries. that's in my checklist.
[10:31:12] <timmywil> also api.jquery.com
[10:31:53] <timmywil> If I go through it one by one, I'll be more confident about not missing something.
[10:32:09] <timmywil> except DaveMethvin|away will need to release migrate 3.0
[10:32:16] <timmywil> before I do the release

[14:46:35] <Krinkle> I'm slightly confused between reading the upgrade guide for 3.0 and the jquery-migrate readme. If I run jQuery 1.11.x now without migrate plugin, and want to go to jQuery 3.0, will that work directly with the 3.0 migrate? Or need to go to 1.12 first?
[14:46:49] <Krinkle> It seems the major changes in 1.12 are covered by the 3.0 migrate plugin.

[15:29:04] <timmywil> Krinkle: there's probably some overlap, but I think safest way is to first upgrade to the latest 1.x, then upgrade to 3.0.
[15:29:37] <timmywil> This post has more details: http://blog.jquery.com/2016/05/19/jquery-migrate-1-4-1-released-and-the-path-to-jquery-3-0/
[15:29:59] <Krinkle> timmywil: "upgrade" in this context means announcing to thousands of developers, and waiting 6 months before we can move forward with the breaking change.
[15:30:17] <Krinkle> Wikimedia has a lot of plugins, all running in the same JS context, unfortunately.
[15:30:37] <timmywil> If they need an older version of jQuery, they shouldn't upgrade
[15:30:46] <timmywil> same as any other library that has a major version bump
[15:32:22] <timmywil> I would hope whatever plugins their using will upgrade and then upgrading will be easy for wikimedia.
[15:32:33] <Krinkle> I'm referring to Wikipedia as the site, not MediaWIki the software. There isn't a way to upgrade on a case by case basis. So we'll upgrade to 1.12 with the 1.x migrate plugin, and then wait 6 months before removing it to give time to all developers of plugins and wiki extensions we have installed to support 1.12
[15:32:53] <Krinkle> There is also millions of individual site users with custom JS code in their customisation panel.
[15:33:06] <timmywil> oh I see. Do you support IE<9?
[15:33:23] <Krinkle> Imagine Chrome shipping jQuery and it trying to upgrade.
[15:33:32] <Krinkle> (slightly exxagerated)
[15:33:35] <timmywil> sure
[15:33:45] <Krinkle> Nope, we dropped IE6-8
[15:33:46] <timmywil> I mean, that's to be expected right?
[15:33:59] <Krinkle> Yeah, but you can see why I'd like to avoid 2 upgrades if 1 will do.
[15:34:24] <Krinkle> I can't see anything that changed in 1.11 -> 1.12 that Migrate 3.0 doesn't cover.
[15:35:02] <timmywil> yea, I can't think of any intentionally breaking changes in 1.12
[15:35:12] <timmywil> any regressions that were found were fixed in patches
[15:35:23] <timmywil> so that *should* be safe
[15:35:32] <timmywil> the big one is 1.9
[15:35:53] <timmywil> that had breaking stuff before we decided to follow semver
[15:36:50] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: all done!

[17:16:03] <timmywil> should the version be 3.0.0?
[17:16:10] <timmywil> on the tag
[17:16:44] <timmywil> maybe just 1.12.4
[17:16:49] <timmywil> we've already got some 3.0 stuff in there
[17:17:13] <Krinkle> timmywil: well, I know there are braking changes in 1.12, such as the selector chose
[17:17:16] <Krinkle> Change
[17:17:28] <Krinkle> I'm just confirming whether the migrate 3.0 will cover them
[17:17:45] <Krinkle> As opposed to needing to migrate to 1.12 with 1.d first
[17:19:13] <Krinkle> If 1.12 breaks other things that's fine too and inevitable regardless of whether to 3.0 directly. I'm mainly worried about changes in 1.12 that *are* patched by migrate 1.x but not by migrate 3
[17:19:16] <timmywil> technically, the selector change is a bug fix. And yea, looks like that's covered in migrate 3.0.
[17:20:03] <Krinkle> If that's the case, we may wanna change the migrate readme note to say 1.11 instead of 1.12
[17:21:21] <timmywil> It's covered in 1.4.1 as well, so I don't see the need.
[17:21:26] <timmywil> you're a special case.
[17:22:22] <timmywil> saying latest 1.x seems simpler anyway
