[06:56:52] <m_gol> Mr21: you have missing dependencies... invoke 'npm install'
[06:58:47] <Mr21> m_gol: thanks, I'm trying
[07:00:52] <m_gol> Mr21: if you use Node.js you'll also need to have Visual Studio installed so that jsdom installation works
[07:01:01] <m_gol> Mr21: it's simpler if you use io.js
[07:01:19] <m_gol> since jsdom then doesn't require compiled modules
[07:04:58] <Mr21> m_gol: after the `npm install` I tried a new `grunt` and here: https://gist.github.com/Mr21/6c1d2a5135855b0ec575 is what I have. But you gave me some new search to do
[07:07:34] <m_gol> Mr21: exactly. That means you use Node.js (probably 0.10 or 0.12) and don't have Visual Studio installed
[07:07:53] <m_gol> Mr21: the easiest solution is to install io.js, remove node_modules & invoke 'npm install' again
[07:08:09] <m_gol> Mr21: if you need to stay on Node.js, you need to install Visual Studio
[07:08:51] <m_gol> Mr21: for more on this Visual Studio thing, read the Windows section at https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-gyp#installation
[07:12:23] <Mr21> m_gol: thanks I'll try this asap, and I will edit my comment on the issue with the solution (for other peoples maybe)
[07:12:46] <m_gol> Mr21: btw, it's useful to have many Node.js & io.js versions on one machine
[07:13:00] <m_gol> on Linus/OS X the good tool to do it is nvm, there is a Windows equivalent: https://github.com/hakobera/nvmw
[07:13:22] <m_gol> you'll then be able to use Node.js in projects that don't work with io.js & io.js in others, like jQuery

[09:59:28] <m_gol> gibson042: re https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2390#issuecomment-112133616, there is no "IE Edge", it's just "Edge" ;)
[09:59:35] <m_gol> unless you meant "IE & Edge"
[09:59:49] <m_gol> it's officially a new browser
[09:59:53] <gibson042> I suppose the latter applies, but thanks
[09:59:57] <gibson042> :)
[10:00:31] <m_gol> gibson042: the good thing about this separation is that on Windows 10 you can test on Edge & IE11 without using any additional VMs ;-)
[10:11:27] <gibson042> I never thought I'd see the day
[10:18:35] <m_gol> gibson042: do you have a specific plan for https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/294? I don't understand Sizzle innards enough to make bigger refactorings that are now possible but I could help in removing legacy code if it helps at all.
[10:22:59] <gibson042> I'd like to get to a point where the same codebase supports multiple buildsâ€”standard/modern/etc. and "compat"
[10:23:31] <gibson042> there shouldn't be need of a major refactoring until/unless positional selectors hit the chopping block
[10:23:57] <m_gol> compat will be aligned with jQuery Compat, right?
[10:24:17] <gibson042> no, compat for Sizzle will be IE6+
[10:24:22] <m_gol> ah, ok
[10:24:33] <gibson042> it's just a more raw and low-level library
[10:24:37] <m_gol> I see
[10:25:31] <m_gol> gibson042: something like https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js/blob/c8fd9c8c06cf14ff2203a089f17c881dcdb9ca10/src/pdf.js#L40-L51?
[10:26:01] <m_gol> and do you plan to support what's there currently (e.g. Firefox 3.0+) or just jQuery Compat browser set + IE6+?
[10:26:01] <gibson042> maybe
[10:26:16] <gibson042> what's there currently
[10:26:31] <gibson042> jQuery should need only the standard build
[10:26:54] <gibson042> the other one will be much less utilized
[10:27:13] <m_gol> standard for Compat & modern for master?
[10:27:22] <m_gol> not sure how many IE8-only workarounds are there
[10:27:59] <gibson042> no, hopefully both builds of jQuery will use the same Sizzle build
[10:28:08] <gibson042> but it depends on the nature of the workarounds
[10:30:23] <gibson042> it may just coincide with jQuery dropping IE8
[10:30:50] <m_gol> gibson042: the issue is targetted at jQuery 3.0.0, though
[10:31:20] <gibson042> corrected
[10:31:55] <gibson042> it's still high priority, but I won't hold up jQuery over it
[10:32:07] <m_gol> k
[10:34:10] <m_gol> excluding via comments is one way, another is to wrap in `if (COMPAT) {...}` and let uglify chop it via dead code removal & --define
[10:34:40] <m_gol> but then only minified builds would have those blocks removed so perhaps comments are better
[10:35:52] <gibson042> yeah, it's basically comments or dead code removal, with the latter achievable through modules or if blocks
[10:39:02] <m_gol> gibson042: do you want to split the file into modules?
[10:40:02] <gibson042> yes, provided it doesn't uncomfortably inflate the size
