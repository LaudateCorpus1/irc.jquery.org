[05:41:08] <mgol> leobalter: ping
[08:25:54] <leobalter> mgol pong
[08:36:39] <mgol> leobalter: is there any good way to mock native stuff in QUnit before the tested code is loaded?
[08:37:22] <mgol> we currently load jQuery in the template but then during the QUnit setup/beforeEach hook jQuery has already run so it's sometimes too late to reliably mock stuff
[08:53:06] <leobalter> we don't use any mock w/ QUnit, so this is something I would need to investigate
[08:54:28] <leobalter> but are you trying to set QUnit hooks to run before loading jQuery?
[18:01:35] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: leobalter: Would it make sense to invite node-qunit to the qunit org? (Or perhaps this was attempted already?)

[18:01:57] <Krinkle> etc.
[18:02:16] <Krinkle> Also given our plans to provide a cli, this would be a good spot for it to go
[18:02:25] <Krinkle> even if it ends up merging into core, using that package name 
[18:02:35] <Krinkle> or deprecating it it we want
