[06:20:29] <mgol> saptaks: you'll need an iframe test
[06:20:56] <saptaks> mgol: so I tried writing an iframe test.
[06:21:26] <saptaks> But now I am facing a different issue.
[06:22:07] <saptaks> So I wrote this html file to use in iframe test. The html file when opened from the browser shows the error perfectly (I did window.console.log).
[06:22:27] <saptaks> But when I use it with testIframe(), it doesn't replicate the error.
[06:22:32] <mgol> an example of how to hook it up: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/3.2.1/test/unit/event.js#L2538-L2545 for the page https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/3.2.1/test/data/event/focusElem.html
[06:22:59] <saptaks> mgol: yes.
[06:23:03] <saptaks> I wrote like this only.
[06:23:13] <saptaks> Wait. I will push to my branch so you can have a look
[06:23:16] <mgol> saptaks: it's hard to debug without seeing it. Do you have it on a brach?
[06:23:18] <mgol> haha, right
[06:23:38] <mgol> I can't promise to look into it right now (I'm at work) but I'll try to do that soon enough
[06:28:05] <saptaks> mgol: I understand. I am at work too. :)
[06:29:37] <saptaks> mgol: when you are free please have a look at this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/compare/master...SaptakS:css/width
[06:31:58] <mgol> thx
[06:33:18] <saptaks> mgol: I have the fix for the issue ready. But first I wanted the unittest to work properly so as to confirm.
[06:35:25] <mgol> cool, thx
[06:36:15] <mgol> btw, the team is currently using Gitter's jquery/dev channel more often than IRC
[06:37:38] <saptaks> mgol: oh. cool.
