[09:49:14] <brennino> Hi, in jquery mobile with multipage configuration I open a page with $( "body" ).pagecontainer( "change", "#my-page",{role:"page"});  after that I open the page with $( "body" ).pagecontainer( "change", "#my-page",{role:"dialog"}); but the framework still show me the page as a page and not as a dialog.
[09:49:35] <brennino> How can I solve this and get the presumibly correct behaviour
[09:49:36] <brennino> ?
