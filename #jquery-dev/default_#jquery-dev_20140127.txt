[07:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...on the verge of some GitHub outages? https://status.github.com/
[07:08:09] <scott_gonzalez> heh, indeed, status just changed out of green.

[08:38:14] <DaveMethvin> so i managed to get a connection, will be there for the meeting in 20 minutes
[08:38:25] <m_gol> :)
[08:38:40] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: did you see latest swarmy?
[08:38:47] <m_gol> only IE6 is failing
[08:38:48] <DaveMethvin> lemme look
[08:39:16] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: ie7 is fixed?
[08:39:18] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[08:39:45] <m_gol> at this point I think IE6 might never be satisfied
[08:40:02] <DaveMethvin> something ironic about it stopping on stop()
[08:40:09] <m_gol> haha
[08:40:22] <m_gol> maybe I'll re-trigger the build and see if it happens again
[08:40:33] <m_gol> maybe this time it'll stop on start() in a true Windows manner
[08:40:41] <DaveMethvin> lol
[08:41:11] <m_gol> there was a weird bug recently
[08:41:17] <m_gol> only IE6 was running tests
[08:46:13] <m_gol> wow, this time Safari 7 has some problems
[08:46:24] <m_gol> in ajax
[08:46:48] <m_gol> never-ending story ;)
[08:46:59] <DaveMethvin> let's get krinkle to redo this so each run gets a "best 2 out of 3" mode, if it passes twice we consider it passed
[08:47:09] <m_gol> & Chrome fails in effects again :(
[08:47:26] <DaveMethvin> do you ever see these failing randomly when local?
[08:47:32] <m_gol> no
[08:47:38] <m_gol> those are not failures per se
[08:47:40] <DaveMethvin> i think i've seen it a couple of times with ie11 but that tends to be stable in the swarm
[08:47:48] <m_gol> it just stops executing tests at some point
[08:48:04] <DaveMethvin> oh did that fix to clearTimeout land?
[08:50:40] <m_gol> I guess not ;)
[08:50:41] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/libs/qunit/qunit.js#L23
[08:51:43] <DaveMethvin> we could land something but i wanted Krinkle to be aware since he knows the code better
[08:51:49] <m_gol> sure
[08:52:02] <m_gol> maybe we could create a PR and ping Krinkle
[08:53:20] <m_gol> it might have gone right because IE6 was running by itself due to infra hiccup and the rest was tested separately after some time
[08:53:27] <m_gol> maybe it's worse if you do it all at the same time
[08:54:39] <DaveMethvin> oh like load dependent somehow
[08:54:47] <DaveMethvin> which might affect timing
[08:55:06] <m_gol> yup
[08:55:53] <DaveMethvin> m_gol:  can you put together a pr for the clearTimeout thing?
[08:55:58] <DaveMethvin> adding that to the agenda

[11:04:24] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[11:04:33] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[11:04:54] <m_gol> I assume I can add iOS6 to browserSets: popular, popular-no-ie6 & popular-no-old-ie?
[11:05:28] <DaveMethvin> that sounds like the easiest way since we're using those sets
[11:05:38] <m_gol> ok, I was mostly thinking about UI etc.
[11:05:48] <DaveMethvin> oh better check with scott_gonzalez 
[11:05:56] <m_gol> yeah, that's why I asked
[11:06:06] <DaveMethvin> browserstack aint done until ui won't run
[11:06:24] <m_gol> I know they use popular-no-ie6, but just ommiting it there seems like not the best idea
[11:06:33] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: ping
[11:06:43] <DaveMethvin> how clean is our iOS6 run right now
[11:06:45] <DaveMethvin> ?
[11:06:50] <m_gol> 0 errors :)
[11:06:55] <DaveMethvin> can't beat that!
[11:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we want UI tests running on mobile devices right now.
[11:07:08] <m_gol> I checked on 6.1 so I'll try 6.0, there's always a chance sth will differ
[11:07:11] <DaveMethvin> then whatever problems come up should be UI ones or core-UI ineractions
[11:07:26] <m_gol> ok, so it seems we'd like to get different sets for UI & core
[11:07:31] <DaveMethvin> i am thinking we may want our own browsersets too
[11:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: You can try running the UI tests in iOS6 and see what happens.
[11:07:39] <m_gol> :)
[11:07:45] <DaveMethvin> can't we specify them in the gruntfile?
[11:07:48] <m_gol> so maybe "popular" is not the best name if we want to add iOS there
[11:07:50] <DaveMethvin> i thougth we could
[11:08:04] <DaveMethvin> seems like an unneeded extra indirection
[11:08:13] <m_gol> so that we're clear it's not the same as popular-no-ie6 but just without IE6
[11:08:47] <m_gol> we're passing the browserSets variable to testswarm
[11:08:56] <m_gol> so I don't see a place where I could add a browser
[11:09:25] <DaveMethvin> it would be more convenient if we could specify the browsers in the gruntfile
[11:09:28] <m_gol> does any other project use the popular browserSet?
[11:09:32] <m_gol> yeah, definitely
[11:11:58] <m_gol> ha
[11:12:00] <m_gol> seems we can
[11:12:08] <m_gol> https://github.com/jzaefferer/node-testswarm/blob/596a58e74e63bc2d06938b5e36f3eb303900bd23/lib/testswarm.js#L167
[11:12:59] <m_gol> I'd try it but maybe not necessarily on master
[11:13:06] <m_gol> ok, I can try a separate Jenkins job
[11:13:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah, make a test job and see what you can break :)
[11:14:07] <DaveMethvin> make that jenkins guy sweat!
[11:14:11] <m_gol> ;)
[11:14:19] <m_gol> I can see now infra work can be time-consuming...
[11:21:22] <m_gol> hm
[11:21:42] <m_gol> tried to save settings on a copy job and got a huge popup titled "Error" with empty contents
[11:21:53] <DaveMethvin> good news, no error~

[11:27:33] <m_gol> so, it seems it doesn't accept an array
[11:27:38] <m_gol> even though docs say otherwise
[11:28:55] <m_gol> jzaefferer: ping
[11:29:28] <DaveMethvin> i see the browserset code but trying to find where it accepts an explicit set
[11:29:58] <m_gol> I'm looking at this: https://github.com/jzaefferer/node-testswarm/blob/master/lib/testswarm.js#L185
[11:30:18] <m_gol> ok, so I need to look at testswarm code directly
[11:30:56] <DaveMethvin> so do we define the bs in our incoming data? https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/ca6eba0e00ef3c135937e22822560b730ba233fb/scripts/addjob/README.md#browsers
[11:31:57] <m_gol> not sure what those entries "browserSets[]=: .." mean
[11:32:39] <DaveMethvin> to accomplish this miracle, specify "dot dot dot" and then it will work :)
[11:32:48] <m_gol> :)
[11:32:58] <m_gol> where is the actual code for that? I see only readme
[11:33:31] <DaveMethvin> i think i did this before..tryna find my code

[11:37:54] <m_gol> there's this: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/inc/pages/AddjobPage.php
[11:37:56] <DaveMethvin> i am pretty sure we can specify a bs in the gruntfile, seem to remember jzaefferer mentioning that but i don't remember how to do it
[11:37:59] <m_gol> but it doesn't look like it
[11:38:26] <m_gol> well, node-testswarm claims you just pass an arary instead of string: https://github.com/jzaefferer/node-testswarm/blob/master/lib/testswarm.js#L185
[11:38:41] <m_gol> but if it's an array, it seems it's not just an array of browser name strings
[11:38:51] <m_gol> http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%20mzgol%20swarmy%20ios6/2/console
[11:39:03] <m_gol> ahh
[11:39:11] <m_gol> I guess you can provide an array of browserSets
[11:39:15] <m_gol> and not an array of browsers
[11:39:30] <m_gol> but that means we could define ios & android browserSets
[11:39:35] <m_gol> & dispatch to both popular & ios
[11:39:45] <m_gol> gonna try that
[11:39:49] <DaveMethvin> we could define each browser as a browserSet!
[11:39:54] <m_gol> hahaha
[11:39:59] <m_gol> I was waiting for you to say that :P
[11:40:07] <DaveMethvin> thereby defeating the purpose of the redirection entirely!
[11:40:49] <m_gol> I'll add ios: ["iphone-ios_6_0"] to infra if you don't mind
[11:40:57] <m_gol> later we can add 7_0 to that set
[11:41:09] <DaveMethvin> give it a try, don't cost nothin
[11:41:32] <m_gol> and android: ["android_4_4"]
[11:42:24] <m_gol> meh, no
[11:42:30] <m_gol> BrowserStack didn't notice 4.4 is out
[11:42:37] <m_gol> it didn't even notice 4.3 is out! :(
[11:42:55] <m_gol> it amazes me their updates are going so slow... considering it's all the service is about
[11:43:07] <m_gol> so much for our testing on Android :(
[11:43:44] <m_gol> SauceLabs doesn't even have 4.1
[11:44:10] <m_gol> maybe they adjust the speed of adding new versions to the speed of the Android emulator
[11:45:01] <DaveMethvin> maybe they decided to do a test run before adding it and the test run isn't done  yet. :)
[11:45:31] <m_gol> seems probable :P
[11:45:41] <m_gol> but seriously, I'm amazed
[11:46:10] <m_gol> considering we're doing much better on newer releases, it's hard to just start from Android 4.2
[11:46:23] <m_gol> and fix all 20 errors
[11:46:25] <m_gol> or so

[12:08:36] <doesallmagic2> m.goleb: Tests: Add ios to TestSwarm browserSets
[12:16:21] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: so it seems browserSets are defined in /usr/local/bin/tools/node-testswarm-config.json on jq03
[12:16:25] <m_gol> per project
[12:16:31] <m_gol> do we want to move it to the repo?
[12:17:07] <m_gol> maybe not since the sets are defined in infra repo anyway
[12:19:19] <DaveMethvin> i'm just wondering what benefit the browserset mapping provides
[12:19:24] <m_gol> yeah
[12:19:40] <m_gol> though I'm not sure how 1.x is handled anyway since it's not mentioned in this json
[12:19:48] <m_gol> maybe it's hacked around
[12:20:31] <m_gol> keeping it in the repo would also make it easier for us to both develop on master & maintain the last stable branch with different browser sets
[12:20:35] <m_gol> now it's kinda impossib;e
[12:21:21] <m_gol> ok, so I guess I'll add the browserset to the config and we can discuss moving the info later

[13:10:59] <gnarf> m_gol: sup?
[13:11:47] <m_gol> I had a problem with /tools/node-testswarm-config.json not being respected
[13:11:58] <m_gol> I wanted to change browserSets to add ios for jQuery
[13:12:11] <m_gol> in the end I just added them to the repo as was already done for jQuery
[13:12:25] <m_gol> so I'm ok now
[13:12:45] <m_gol> but I think it would be more convenient to be able to specify browsers directly instead of predefined sets, see https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/236
[13:13:47] <m_gol> I created way too many jobs during troubleshooting: http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery but they'll resolve over time
