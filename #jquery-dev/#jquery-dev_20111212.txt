[06:27:06] <timmywil> mornin rick
[06:45:42] <danzik17> rwaldron: before i forget to mention it again, your page on google ( richardwaldron.com ) is redirecting to some spam site
[06:46:10] <DaveMethvin> danzik17: not for me
[06:46:24] <DaveMethvin> unless you consider spam to be some ugly guy with a light saber
[06:46:32] <danzik17> DaveMethvin: you going straight to it, or searching via google?  going straight to the hostname works just fine
[06:46:37] <danzik17> it's only the google link, oddly enough
[06:46:45] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll try that
[06:47:14] <DaveMethvin> Hmmm, that is STRANGE
[06:47:17] <danzik17> HAH
[06:47:50] <DaveMethvin> breaks for subpage searches too
[06:50:17] <rwaldron> danzik17 thanks
[06:50:20] <rwaldron> tht's a bummer
[06:50:27] <rwaldron> but i asked boaz to take it down
[06:50:28] * rwaldron shrugs
[06:51:37] <DaveMethvin> how is that happening? did you look at the net trace rwaldron?
[06:51:47] <DaveMethvin> i don't see it hitting richardwaldron.com at all
[06:52:20] <danzik17> DaveMethvin: its not - the actual href on googles link isn't actually richwardwaldron.com, it's some internal googly thing which must have been corrupted
[06:52:28] <danzik17> i'm curious how they pulled that off honestly
[06:52:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah it seems devilishly clever
[06:52:58] <timmywil> like joker
[06:53:22] <DaveMethvin> if we can figure it out I'll split the profits from spamming 50/50 with you :P
[06:53:32] <rwaldron> danzik17 DaveMethvin so... basically it looks like "if there is a search referrer, forward to ...."
[06:53:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah but that is coming from google?

[06:54:33] * rwaldron shrug
[06:54:50] <rwaldron> i'm just telling you what I've observed in the source
[06:54:50] <danzik17> ah well that makes more sense than you know....google getting tricked.
[06:55:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah, there is probably something i am missing there
[06:55:28] <rwaldron> I'm going to contact reinvigorate.net and tell them the account number of the snippet that was embedded
[06:55:45] <DaveMethvin> looks like the spam site has beeen taken down
[07:07:48] <rwaldron> timmywil "best not to make commits that have tests for methods that don't exist... makes it very clear that you didn't test your code"

[07:10:15] <DaveMethvin> i don't think he even looked at the diffs, seems kinda obvious when you look at them
[07:12:16] <rwaldron> painfully obvious

[07:13:05] <rwaldron> "looking in code, this is not a duplicate of the nextAll/prevAll."
[07:13:27] <DaveMethvin> i love the way danheberden takes a screen shot on that one
[07:15:55] <rwaldron> ?rtfp is https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/README.md
[07:15:57] <bot-t> rwaldron, Couldn't find "rtfp is https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/README.md" in jQuery Docs.
[07:16:18] <rwaldron> bot-t: rtfp is https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/README.md
[07:16:19] <bot-t> rwaldron, Stored "rtfp".

[07:30:16] <timmywil> rwaldron, DaveMethvin https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/compare/master...bug_10782#L0R273
[07:30:40] <timmywil> ?10782
[07:30:41] <bot-t> [#10782] Incorrect calculating width (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10782
[07:30:51] <timmywil> Better, not perfect
[07:31:19] <rwaldron> ["height", "width"] => [ "height", "width" ]
[07:31:39] <timmywil> heh
[07:32:02] <rwaldron> it was like that before
[07:32:13] <timmywil> yea
[07:32:16] <timmywil> but i can change it
[07:32:17] <rwaldron> I realize that wasn't the point of showing us that
[07:32:31] <rwaldron> sorry, I'm not ignoring the important part
[07:32:36] <rwaldron> i just happen to notice it
[07:32:42] <rwaldron> happened*
[07:32:45] <timmywil> understandable
[07:33:27] <rwaldron> I also realize that is irrelevant for your current purposes
[07:33:32] <rwaldron> so, sorry about that
[07:34:15] <rwaldron> how does it compress?
[07:34:59] <timmywil> rwaldron: somehow, -3
[07:35:03] <rwaldron> nice
[07:37:24] <timmywil> i have a jshint mode in emacs so I just reordered to satisfy undef, which seemed to compress a bit better and didn't require messing with recursive definitions.  The main point here though is that we return the value if the unit is not pixels.  So a computed or uncomputed width of 20% gets returned immediately.
[07:38:31] <timmywil> The problem is that outer/innerWidth won't add/remove padding/border/margin, but .css('width') is corrected to not show 20px anymore
[07:38:53] <timmywil> I'm ok with the former and the latter is an improvement.  What you think?
[07:40:04] <timmywil> and this is still an edge case where the parent is hidden and the child has a unit other than pixels
[07:40:06] <DaveMethvin> it's better than lying about px, that's fer sure
[07:40:16] <DaveMethvin> or if the element is not in a doc
[07:40:45] <DaveMethvin> i mean, what could we possibly return if width is 20% and the elment is detached?
[07:40:47] <timmywil> right, that too
[07:40:57] <timmywil> i suppose null
[07:41:04] <DaveMethvin> "stupid"
[07:41:04] <timmywil> but 20% is probably more useful
[07:41:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:41:25] <DaveMethvin> they are all edge cases from doing questionable things
[07:41:37] <DaveMethvin> so as long as they aren't flat-out incorrect it sounds good to me
[07:41:48] <timmywil> cool
[07:42:14] <DaveMethvin> and yay for -3 :D
[07:43:03] <rwaldron> yeah definitely
[07:43:27] <DaveMethvin> oh timmywil were you going to expose origPOS?
[07:43:33] <timmywil> ok, going with that
[07:43:39] <timmywil> oh yea
[07:43:42] <timmywil> forgot about that
[07:43:43] <timmywil> which ticket?
[07:44:06] <timmywil> i remember it was for traversing
[07:44:22] <DaveMethvin> hold on i have it
[07:44:41] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/eHWzrg
[07:44:41] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] When the width/height computed unit is not pixels, return that instead. Fixes #10782. - timmywil
[07:44:44] <danheberden> DaveMethvin so i have an idea for a prevAt method

[07:46:30] <jq-jenkins> timmywillisn: When the width/height computed unit is not pixels, return that instead. Fixes #10782.
[07:46:48] <timmywil> ah yea
[07:46:55] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: copy and paste some code, then file a pull request with no test cases
[07:47:13] <DaveMethvin> that is our standard procedure ... oh and don't forget to work on the MASTER branch
[07:47:24] <danheberden> DaveMethvin http://danheberden.com/share/09c3.png
[07:47:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah!
[07:52:20] <timmywil> hmm, how should we expose this
[07:52:33] <timmywil> jQuery.expr.match.orig.POS ?
[07:52:35] <timmywil> eek
[07:52:46] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[07:53:01] <DaveMethvin> orig seems like the wrong connotatino
[07:53:05] <DaveMethvin> connotation
[07:53:34] <DaveMethvin> so it's modified in that loop that appends more stuff to it
[07:53:51] <DaveMethvin> but the original POS value is what really is looking just for positional selectors
[07:53:52] <timmywil> yup
[07:54:08] <timmywil> regardless of their presence in brackets/parens
[07:54:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:54:20] <DaveMethvin> which we don't care about over in jQUery land
[07:54:28] <timmywil> right
[07:54:41] <timmywil> well, maybe we care about brackets
[07:54:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah technicallly we do don't we
[07:54:52] <timmywil> but worst case it selects it again
[07:55:16] <DaveMethvin> all i want to know for event is whether to throw it to sizzle or not
[07:55:20] <timmywil> the difference in .is (and .closest for that matter), is it gets passed to fn.init again
[07:55:25] <DaveMethvin> so a false positive doesn't bother me
[07:55:51] <timmywil> instead of matchesSelector
[07:56:10] <timmywil> in other word, I think we can use origPOS safely
[07:56:14] <timmywil> words*
[07:56:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah i agree
[07:56:28] <DaveMethvin> and if it does fail it's on a pathological selector
[07:56:30] <timmywil> but where oh where does it go
[07:56:49] <DaveMethvin> and what is it called
[07:56:57] <timmywil> Expr.unwrappedMatch?
[07:57:10] <DaveMethvin> simpleMatch?
[07:57:20] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.expr.match.simplePOS ?
[07:58:31] <timmywil> hmm
[07:59:06] <timmywil> match.globalPOS?
[07:59:14] <DaveMethvin> works for me
[07:59:40] <timmywil> kk
[08:23:14] <sizcommit> [sizzle] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/LBBH_A

[08:46:52] <timmywil> that's exciting
[08:54:10] <rwaldron> kswedberg yt?
[08:54:29] <rwaldron> i have a question about how to "categorize" api methods
[08:54:33] <kswedberg> hey rwaldron
[08:54:50] <rwaldron> in a way that is easily understood by both seasoned JS devs and n00bs alike
[08:54:55] <rwaldron> currently, using:
[08:55:30] <rwaldron> Static Methods: Popcorn.foo()
[08:55:40] <rwaldron> Instance Methods: Popcorn.prototype.foo()
[08:55:47] <rwaldron> static and instance are crappy
[08:56:06] <kswedberg> yeah. there has to be a better way of describing that distinction
[08:56:13] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: meeting today?
[08:56:24] <DaveMethvin> sure why not :)
[08:56:34] <DaveMethvin> i have the agenda updated, it's pretty light
[08:56:48] <DaveMethvin> if you guys want to add anything or just bring anything up feel free
[08:57:25] <timmywil> channel open
[08:58:19] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i loved your ticket summaries, so many lols
[08:58:40] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: HOWEVER i still think that serializeObject should be in core
[08:58:56] <DaveMethvin> after a while it gets kind of boring to see "please add moar stuff"
[08:58:59] <DaveMethvin> so i had to spice it up
[09:00:09] <kswedberg> rwaldron: are all of the static methods "utility methods"?
[09:00:15] <rwaldron> yeah
[09:00:23] <rwaldron> that might work nicely
[09:00:28] <rwaldron> "utility methods"
[09:00:46] <kswedberg> k
[09:01:51] <kswedberg> rwaldron:  the Instance methods are maybe "Popcorn video methods"? or something like that?
[09:02:23] <DaveMethvin> core meeting starting in #jquery-meeting now if anyone wants to join
[09:11:21] <rwaldron> kswedberg yeah, i'm into that
[09:54:24] <jaubourg> ...
[09:54:53] <rwaldron> where is mikesherov
[09:55:56] <mikesherov> still can't see it
[09:56:12] <rwaldron> did you click on a summary?
[09:56:17] <rwaldron> in that link that timmywil send?
[09:56:19] <rwaldron> sent*
[09:56:21] <mikesherov> yes
[09:56:24] <rwaldron> ok
[09:56:34] <mikesherov> I left clicked on the summary, took me to the detail view

[09:57:14] <rwaldron> ?slap mikesherov

[09:58:31] <mikesherov> I can't see the votes though?
[09:58:56] <mikesherov> didn't you guys used to say "+1" on the tickets literally?
[09:59:06] <mikesherov> Am I supposed to do that, or just vote?
[09:59:15] <ajpiano> mikesherov: the vote ends up getting processed into the comment that you saw
[09:59:38] <mikesherov> ok, so I voted it up but I don't see a comment from me
[10:00:25] <rwaldron> try again
[10:00:29] <rwaldron> sorry

[10:03:21] <rwaldron> i'm hungru

[10:14:57] <mikesherov> thanks for trying to help!
[10:21:43] <danheberden> JohnResig any secret to getting mikesherov voting rights on bugs.jquery.com ?
[10:31:29] <JohnResig> danheberden: it's part of the script, a static list of contributors
[10:35:44] <danheberden> JohnResig where is it roughly?
[10:35:47] <danheberden> i had a hard time finding it
[10:36:59] <gnarf> hey - can anyone change my password on trac for me?
[10:37:24] <gnarf> i can't remember it - and the forgot password email never showed up in my inbox
[10:38:50] <gnarf> i thought the voting script let people with TRAC_ADMIN vote... *shrug*
[10:39:11] <gnarf> john knows best tho, he wrote the thing :)
[10:41:01] <rwaldron> gnarf yeah same here
[10:43:48] <gnarf> okay
[10:43:53] <gnarf> before someone else does
[10:44:04] <gnarf> both danheberden and timmywil have changed my pass for me - thanks guys :)
[10:44:09] <timmywil> ha, woops
[10:44:11] <danheberden> hha
[10:44:16] <danheberden> h'ha
[10:44:30] <gnarf> i went to change the pass and it was like "wrong password"
[10:44:52] <gnarf> and i was like "DAN JUST CHANGED IT!!!" - then i was like - wait, i'll get another PM from someone.... TIMMY!!!!

[14:11:55] <ben_alman> thx
[16:01:32] <mikesherov> danheberden: you here? I need access to the 1.8 ticket vote!
[16:01:32] <bot-t> (5 hours 4 mins 40 secs ago) <danheberden> tell mikesherov - should be ok now
[16:24:01] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin, i'm still unable to vote on tixx for 1.8
[16:24:41] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: i think i have the right perms, just not sure why its not working
[16:26:00] <DaveMethvin> ugh mikesherov, i dunno
[16:26:12] <mikesherov> k
[16:26:13] <DaveMethvin> sounds like the names are hardwired into the script?
[16:26:21] <mikesherov> maybe
[16:26:22] <DaveMethvin> i think danheberden was looking at it
[16:26:57] <mikesherov> maybe i need to be in the htpasswd file?
[16:27:12] <mikesherov> danheberden: maybe?
[16:27:18] <DaveMethvin> wouldn't seem that way
[16:27:29] <DaveMethvin> i would guess either a permissions flag or it's in the script
[16:27:32] <DaveMethvin> lemme look at the perms
[16:30:27] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i think it has to be somewhere other than trac perms b/c yours are similar to others who can vote
[16:30:40] <mikesherov> yes
[16:30:57] <mikesherov> its gotta be in the script then
[16:31:04] <DaveMethvin> i like the idea of adding a TRAC_VOTER perm tho
[16:31:13] <DaveMethvin> sure would make this easier
[16:31:39] <ajpiano> [13:31:29] <JohnResig> danheberden: it's part of the script, a static list of contributors
[16:35:14] <mikesherov> hmm
[16:35:28] <mikesherov> so.... can i edit the file?
[16:35:33] <ajpiano> i donno what script it is though, i just write the blog posts
[16:35:55] <ajpiano> and ... delete massive amounts of data :|
[16:36:24] <DaveMethvin> i had access to that server at one time
[16:36:26] <mikesherov> somewhere in: /var/www/bugs.jquery.com?
[16:36:42] <mikesherov> k
[16:36:53] <DaveMethvin> i dunno where the script is
[16:37:02] <mikesherov> so who WOULD have access?
[16:37:10] <DaveMethvin> danheberden fer shure
[16:37:17] <ajpiano> i think he's afk atm
[16:37:40] <DaveMethvin> well the polls are open all week, no hurry
[16:37:47] <mikesherov> k
[16:37:57] <mikesherov> g2g, i'll bug dh later
[16:38:03] <DaveMethvin> if worse come to worst you can keep notes and add them
