[08:21:31] <Guest25982> hello all
[08:22:20] <Guest25982> i am new to open source and i want to contribute to jQuery. I would like some guidance on where to begin.
[10:29:08] <Elena-rus> hi
[10:30:54] <Elena-rus> I've got to play an mp3 on tap, and the source has got to depend on the index of the a tag
[10:31:07] <Elena-rus> not sure how to implement this, would anybody please advise?
[10:31:45] <kborchers> Elena-rus: not sure what that has to do with jQuery. Also, for support ask in #jquery, this is the development channel
[10:31:55] <Elena-rus>  $("#playaudio").live('tap', function() { var src = 'crash.mp3';
[10:31:55] <Elena-rus>         playAudio(src);
[10:31:55] <Elena-rus>     })
[10:32:11] <kborchers> also, please don't paste code in the channel
[10:32:12] <Elena-rus> #playaudio is an A href id
[10:32:45] <Elena-rus> the src has got to be dynamic
[10:33:00] <Elena-rus> the name of the link depending on the A index
