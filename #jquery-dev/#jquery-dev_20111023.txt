[10:31:45] <rwaldron> gnarf yt?
[10:31:53] <gnarf> sup rick
[10:31:56] <rwaldron> hey dude
[10:32:19] <rwaldron> as wondering, have you recently experienced IE8 crashes with the test suite?
[10:32:22] <rwaldron> was*
[10:32:55] <gnarf> i try not to experience ie8 at all ;)
[10:33:04] <rwaldron> good call
[10:33:33] <gnarf> but as far as i know, it seems to be running alright
[10:33:39] <gnarf> you're talking the core unit i imagine?
[10:33:52] <rwaldron> yep
[10:34:20] <gnarf> ill run ie8 against it now
[10:34:27] <rwaldron> thanks
[10:34:32] <rwaldron> ie7 is fine
[10:35:00] <rwaldron> but i've crashed ie8 11 times now
[10:35:13] <rwaldron> but I'm not sure if it's Browserstack or the test suite
[10:37:25] <gnarf> well im using a clean ie8 on win 7 vm
[10:37:36] <gnarf> about to get it running
[10:37:39] <gnarf> my cpu is slow as shit
[10:43:54] <gnarf> rwaldron: where did it "crash" ?
[10:44:23] <rwaldron> when I navigate to the test suite
[10:44:29] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/3p1D2C1v0R1F3B340Q3T
[10:44:33] <gnarf> i managed to run it
[10:44:43] <gnarf> so im guessing its one of the browserstack addons for debugging?
[10:44:49] <rwaldron> ok, cool
[10:45:15] <rwaldron> thanks for helping me with that
[10:45:24] <gnarf> np
[10:45:30] <rwaldron> sucks though, i can't test this thing I'm trying to figure out
[10:45:33] * rwaldron sighs
[10:53:58] <gnarf> have you tried running the browserstack without the debug tools?
[10:54:02] <gnarf> to see if it makes a difference?
[12:53:39] <timmywil> ?tell jaubourg Opera 11.51 is failing on jQuery.ajax - statusText. jqXHR.statusText === "error" instead of "World" or even Safari's "Not Found".
[12:53:39] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[12:55:39] <timmywil> and why does opera have a problem with iframes only when running the full suite? O.o

[15:19:40] <Krinkle> hey all, got an annoying bug on http://bugs.jquery.com/ that I'm not sure where to report. Whenever a commit is mentioned in a comment on a ticket, it's nicely detected by Trac but the anchor tag doesn't have a href="" attribute. Instead it's title says "No commit **** found in this repository"
[15:19:58] <Krinkle> can it be simply made to just link to gh.com/jquery/jquery/commit/* ?
[15:20:05] <Krinkle> or otherwise be fixed to become a link ?
[15:20:33] <Krinkle> kinda annoying having to copy and paste it into github, which sometimes doesn't work because Github's permalinks only seem to accept the shorter versions of the hashes
[15:20:43] <Krinkle> Changeset: 83c08ffa1ffa778e41d728ed7fa49044dd7135f9

[15:23:08] <Krinkle> hm.. github search doesn't find it, but directly putting it into the url does work
