[05:55:35] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell DaveMethvin I've rebased all of my PR's in the queue, and that I *SHOULD* be on around noon EST to discuss
[05:55:36] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[05:56:45] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell timmywil Congrats on the new job! Also, if you're planning on merging in JSHint today, I'll be here around noon to assist. Also, don't forget the sizzle PR that goes along with it
[05:56:45] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[07:36:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, jaubourg
[07:36:40] <bot-t> (1 hour 39 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell timmywil Congrats on the new job! Also, if you're planning on merging in JSHint today, I'll be here around noon to assist. Also, don't forget the sizzle PR that goes along with it
[07:37:03] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil, and btw congrats!
[07:37:03] <bot-t> (1 hour 41 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell DaveMethvin I've rebased all of my PR's in the queue, and that I *SHOULD* be on around noon EST to discuss
[07:37:05] <timmywil> I don't think we don't need to merge all the jshint hoisting shit anymore
[07:37:16] <timmywil> new option: http://www.jshint.com/options/  latedef
[07:37:23] <DaveMethvin> HOORAY!
[07:37:41] <DaveMethvin> we can be lazy and still find undefs!
[07:38:19] <DaveMethvin> so can you be around at noon for a pull-fest?  ... wait that didn't sound right
[07:40:57] <jaubourg> \o/
[07:42:27] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: it sounded as gay as it can get
[07:42:32] <jaubourg> \o/
[07:42:33] <DaveMethvin> lol
[07:46:15] <jaubourg> and gratz timmywil too
[07:46:36] <timmywil> oh thanks :)
[07:46:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah that new job looked schweet!
[07:46:58] <timmywil> and yea, I'll be around.  It's my second day so I might be busy at unpredictable times
[07:47:22] <timmywil> it is.  It's new territory for me, but I'm excited to finally get into mobile
[07:50:11] <jaubourg> man, I so need to do something with my life at one point or another
[08:05:17] <mikesherov> timmywil: we still need to do the jshint hoisting shit
[08:05:31] <mikesherov> latedef only works for functions in scope
[08:05:47] <mikesherov> I've been keeping a VERY close eye on JSHint's commit queue
[08:06:31] <mikesherov> and as a matter of fact, the defaults for JSHint are latedef: false
[08:06:36] <mikesherov> which is what we want anyway
[08:06:46] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[08:07:57] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell timmywil we still need to do the jshint hoisting shit, latedef only works for functions in scope, I've been keeping a VERY close eye on JSHint's commit queue, and as a matter of fact, the defaults for JSHint are latedef: false, which is what we want anyway
[08:07:57] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[08:08:42] <timmywil> mikesherov: so it doesn't help us at all?
[08:08:42] <bot-t> (45 secs ago) <mikesherov> tell timmywil we still need to do the jshint hoisting shit, latedef only works for functions in scope, I've been keeping a VERY close eye on JSHint's commit queue, and as a matter of fact, the defaults for JSHint are latedef: false, which is what we want anyway
[08:08:49] <mikesherov> no, unfortunately
[08:09:14] <mikesherov> the hoisting problem isn't solved by the solution implemented in JSHint
[08:09:25] <timmywil> mikesherov: why not?
[08:09:30] <mikesherov> basically, JSHint now waits till the end of parse to see what is defined in scope
[08:09:47] <mikesherov> and if it defined in scope, but later, and latedef is false, no warning
[08:10:05] <mikesherov> but what we do is define util functions in a higher scope
[08:10:19] <mikesherov> so JSHint still says, NO, THATS BAD
[08:10:46] <mikesherov> and really, that way CANT work
[08:11:00] <mikesherov> basically, JSHint should be doing hoisting before parsing
[08:11:03] <mikesherov> that would work
[08:11:30] <mikesherov> but as is, JSHint can't tell the difference between something defined in an outer scope, and an undef
[08:11:55] <timmywil> sounds like it would still help in some places
[08:11:56] <mikesherov> the best it can do is fix it for same-scope at the moment
[08:12:08] <mikesherov> honestly, those are the defaults
[08:12:08] <timmywil> we have definitions in the same scope that are above their usage
[08:12:17] <mikesherov> timmy, not really
[08:12:24] <mikesherov> I tried it 2 days ago
[08:12:32] <timmywil> yes we do
[08:12:38] <mikesherov> and actually, also like 15 days ago when that PR came out, but before it was merged
[08:12:38] <timmywil> jQuery.Deferred
[08:13:06] <mikesherov> link to source on github?
[08:13:59] <timmywil> maybe since then, always pipe are functions it still doesn't apply
[08:14:16] <mikesherov> that's right
[08:14:27] <timmywil> gotcha
[08:14:34] <mikesherov> unfortunately
[08:14:52] <mikesherov> I'd been trying to satisfy jaubourg since he made the argument
[08:15:33] <timmywil> well, I agree with him to an extent
[08:15:40] <timmywil> there are places I don't mind changing order
[08:15:42] <mikesherov> I do too!
[08:15:51] <mikesherov> It'd be great if JSHint understood hoisting
[08:16:09] <mikesherov> I mean, really, whatever uglify does to hoist, that should be a preparse on JSHint
[08:16:30] <timmywil> well, I think we can get it in at some point
[08:16:43] <mikesherov> but I know valueof is working on a new parser anyway, and that's why he has a feature freeze going
[08:16:59] <mikesherov> so maybe we'll see some benefits for that soon
[08:17:41] <mikesherov> I just went ahead and hoisted all the code :-)
[08:17:57] <timmywil> yea, but I don't think we should land that
[08:18:25] <timmywil> switching to jshint is fine, but I'm confident jshint will have a proper hoisting option in the future
[08:18:39] <mikesherov> OK, well, I'm open to suggestions... or are you saying we should wait until JSHint can do the hoisting for us?
[08:18:45] <mikesherov> I see
[08:18:52] <mikesherov> then how do we move forward?
[08:19:04] <timmywil> you still have 2 pulls to choose from right?
[08:19:24] <mikesherov> if I understand, you're saying we want to do everything except undef true?
[08:19:35] <timmywil> for now
[08:20:12] <mikesherov> Well, I'd argue that's the only real reason I even like JSHint, but I'll bite
[08:20:21] <mikesherov> Yeah, I had a closed PR, I can update it
[08:20:39] <mikesherov> just to make sure it has all of the things we want besides undef true
[08:20:50] <timmywil> if jaubourg, DaveMethvin disagree, we can change it, but recursive defitions is the major advantage to hoisting.  jshint should understand it
[08:20:59] <timmywil> and we can wait
[08:21:04] <mikesherov> and then we also gotta pull in the sizzle PR
[08:21:19] <mikesherov> OK, but I think someone should ping valueof and see if that's on his roadmap
[08:21:25] <mikesherov> to do hoisting
[08:22:26] <timmywil> we'll keep bugging him. It may be easier to contribute ourselves after the refactor
[08:22:49] <jaubourg> yep, I think we shouldn't pay the price of recursive defs too
[08:22:50] <timmywil> alright, meeting time
[08:23:28] <mikesherov> k
[08:23:33] <mikesherov> I'll dig up the closed PR
[08:23:35] <mikesherov> thanks for the chat
[08:23:50] <jaubourg> coolness, having jshint will make us safe for the future if nothing else
[08:23:55] <mikesherov> sure
[08:24:12] <mikesherov> and then when it understands hoisting, turn on undef:true
[08:24:24] <jaubourg> ftw, definitely
[08:25:09] <mikesherov> k
[08:25:17] <mikesherov> I'm sad about it, but I understand
[09:00:25] <DaveMethvin> it's time for pull requests, it's time for pull requests, we're gonna clear the queue, that's what we're gonna do
[09:04:50] <ajpiano> is there a ticket for serializeObject somewhere, danheberden ?
[09:04:55] <ajpiano> i feel like there is but i can't find it
[09:05:11] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: i am pretty sure there was
[09:05:27] <DaveMethvin> now i have to prove it
[09:08:03] <DaveMethvin> strike!
[09:08:36] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: that could be a good thing or a bad thing, we talkin baseball or bowling here
[09:08:49] <ajpiano> and if we are talking baseball, are we the hitter or the pitcher
[09:08:53] <DaveMethvin> good point, my word is ambiguous
[09:09:03] <DaveMethvin> i was speaking from the perspective of the head pin
[09:09:14] <DaveMethvin> which is kind of good since i never seem to hit it
[09:09:37] <DaveMethvin> i could have sworn there was a ticket but it doesn't seem to have used the term JSON
[09:10:42] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron timmywil jaubourg mikesherov gnarf:  thoughts on the pull requests?
[09:11:18] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: wait on hoisting changes for jshint
[09:11:26] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: skype review?
[09:11:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah for mike's
[09:11:34] <DaveMethvin> sure
[09:11:49] <DaveMethvin> let me get Skype rumblin stumblin bumblin
[09:12:06] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: no, that's my thought :) wait on it
[09:12:43] <DaveMethvin> for those pulls, yes, we can just close them
[09:12:51] <DaveMethvin> i meant the other ones
[09:13:19] <gnarf> i think timmywil means we should wait to land the hoisting hint changes before landing pulls?
[09:13:29] <timmywil> i mean do not land
[09:13:33] <DaveMethvin> i thought we were not going to ladnd them
[09:13:46] <gnarf> okay
[09:13:48] <DaveMethvin> reading the scrollback from about an hour ago
[09:13:57] <gnarf> i think timmywil means we should land these ;)
[09:14:07] <timmywil> ha
[09:14:13] <DaveMethvin> hit em with an ipad, timmy!
[09:14:24] <gnarf> throw it on the ground!
[09:14:29] <timmywil> i will
[09:14:33] <timmywil> we got plenty here
[09:14:41] <DaveMethvin> gnarf is not a very good timmywil translator, i see
[09:14:47] <gnarf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAYL5H46QnQ
[09:15:03] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i leave this to you https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/620/files
[09:15:06] <gnarf> i think this guy has filed some jQuery bug reports
[09:15:21] <jaubourg> here
[09:15:32] <timmywil> seems like a good idea to me, but what you think?
[09:15:45] <gnarf> hey - where is the submit link for 1.8?
[09:15:48] <gnarf> i can't find it
[09:15:49] <gnarf> :/
[09:16:02] <DaveMethvin> on that drag/drop one i added some more comments on the bug ticket, since the event isn't really cross browser i didn't want to do it unless we were causing pain to someone
[09:16:16] <DaveMethvin> there haven't been a lot of complaints, just suggestted patches
[09:16:19] <gnarf> i wanna make sure to write something up about refactoring effects.js to allow easily swapping out the "timer loop" code with your own, or using it without animating css
[09:16:22] <timmywil> ok
[09:16:54] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: do you mean the spreadsheet with suggestions?
[09:17:11] <jaubourg> do we gather on skype or something?
[09:17:32] <jaubourg> arf, update
[09:17:53] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: or the place to submit a new one - since i never did submit my plan for effects yet
[09:18:06] <gnarf> we've been talking about it since 1.6 tho
[09:18:08] <gnarf> so like
[09:18:11] <gnarf> i assume we could just do it
[09:18:18] <gnarf> but to be fair it needs to be voted
[09:18:29] <DaveMethvin> oh, it's in the blog post, but you can just create a ticket directly with 1.8-discuss in the keywords
[09:18:32] <gnarf> maybe i should just make it a trac ticket and skip the spreadsheet?
[09:18:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:18:41] <timmywil> I'm in a meeting as we do this btw, can't get on skype
[09:19:00] <DaveMethvin> ok, i think we can prolly handle it here, the queue isn't too long
[09:19:01] <jaubourg> focus on your meeting timmy :P
[09:19:16] <jaubourg> allrighty, shoot then :)à
[09:19:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah you need to make a good impression for a few days before they realize you spend all your time here
[09:19:46] <gnarf> jaubourg: i don't think i have you on skype
[09:19:47] <jaubourg> +1 Dave
[09:19:56] <jaubourg> gnarf: orly? it's "underaloz"
[09:19:59] <gnarf> im gnarf37
[09:20:31] <jaubourg> you beat me to the friend request
[09:21:45] <DaveMethvin> we can't hear you julian, lots of static
[09:21:54] <gnarf> sounds like a bad mic cable maybe?
[09:22:08] <jaubourg> do you hear me now?
[09:22:39] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: p610 > p616
[09:23:00] <jaubourg> oki
[09:23:27] <rwaldron> sorry, i missed the ping
[09:24:03] <DaveMethvin> can you skype rwaldron?
[09:24:07] <rwaldron> sure
[09:24:14] <rwaldron> are you all chatting on skype?
[09:24:17] <rwaldron> i need to relocate
[09:24:52] <jaubourg> yes skype
[09:24:58] <jaubourg> Dave will add you rick
[09:24:58] <mikesherov> I'm here!
[09:25:05] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[09:25:14] <DaveMethvin> if you have skype we can add you there
[09:25:17] <mikesherov> hello everyone
[09:25:34] <mikesherov> Hmm, I'm not in a quiet place at work
[09:25:43] <DaveMethvin> np, we'll keep the typing here
[09:25:49] <mikesherov> OK
[09:25:50] <jaubourg> heh, sounds good to me
[09:25:54] <DaveMethvin> timmy is in a meeting and just monitoring
[09:26:23] <mikesherov> so, I'm switching to laptop
[09:26:52] <mikesherov> to drudge up the old PR
[09:27:03] <mikesherov> that has JSHint without undef:true
[09:27:31] <mikesherov> brb
[09:28:22] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i think pull 406 and 528 are related
[09:29:33] <rick-> what is the bug list we're looking at?
[09:29:36] <mikesherov> looking
[09:29:43] <DaveMethvin> it's the pull request list
[09:29:59] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pulls
[09:30:01] <rwaldron> thats what i thought
[09:30:03] <rwaldron> smartass
[09:30:05] <rwaldron> :)
[09:30:06] <DaveMethvin> started at the bottom
[09:30:41] <danheberden> ajpiano did you find your ticket?
[09:30:50] <mikesherov> so 406 is sort of related
[09:31:53] <mikesherov> if we wanted to add box-sizing: border-box to the check in 406
[09:31:58] <mikesherov> that would be fine
[09:32:19] <mikesherov> but 406 still assumes that we don't need to explicitly set box-sizing on the test
[09:32:47] <mikesherov> I would add div.style.boxSizing = "content-box" to the check
[09:33:08] <mikesherov> because the check there seems like it's asking, do you even support the box model at all
[09:33:49] <mikesherov> as opposed to "is the current default style for a div box-sizing:content-box"
[09:34:23] <DaveMethvin> so let me ask, doesn't $.support.boxModel make a bad assumption anyway?
[09:34:31] <mikesherov> Well, SORT OF
[09:34:37] <DaveMethvin> we need to take the element's box-sizing into account
[09:34:43] <mikesherov> I think it's there because it wants to know, is box model available at all
[09:35:03] <mikesherov> as opposed to WHICH box model is used
[09:35:38] <DaveMethvin> but since newer browsers allow  you to override on a per-lement basis...is this telling us anything we can trust?
[09:36:02] <mikesherov_> switched to laptop
[09:36:18] <mikesherov_> so, yeah, let me look at it for a min
[09:38:07] <mikesherov_> my understanding is that this PR, if it's too be corrected, should set all properties related to box-model: box-sizing, width, padding, margin, border
[09:38:33] <mikesherov_> but you're questioning whether or not support.boxModel is even a valid check to have around?
[09:39:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's used in offset but we can't assume all elements have the same boxModel
[09:39:07] <mikesherov_> right
[09:39:41] <rwaldron> "boxModel is equal to true if the page is rendering according to the W3C CSS Box Model (is currently false in IE 6 and 7 when they are in Quirks Mode). This property is null until document ready occurs."
[09:39:41] <mikesherov_> isn't there a PR out there for removing boxModel from the check?
[09:39:53] <rwaldron> gnarf DaveMethvin jaubourg ^^
[09:40:02] <rwaldron> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.support/
[09:40:36] <mikesherov_> Yeah, I think it's needed
[09:41:03] <mikesherov_> because docElem is the document
[09:41:15] <mikesherov_> which itself can't get a different boxSizing
[09:41:19] <DaveMethvin> isn't $.support.boxModel just telling us whether it's in quirks mode?
[09:41:25] <mikesherov_> it is!
[09:41:32] <mikesherov_> but it detects it incorrectly
[09:41:35] <DaveMethvin> but that's not what we want to know when we are using it
[09:41:57] <mikesherov_> well, in offset it's a proxy for "is this quirks mode"?
[09:42:34] <DaveMethvin> but if the element being tested has a box-model that changes the default then it "looks"like quirks mode?
[09:42:39] <mikesherov_> becuase that's when "docElem.scrollTop" is relevant
[09:42:48] <mikesherov_> looks like it, exactly
[09:43:14] <mikesherov_> right
[09:43:33] <mikesherov_> div { box-sizing: border-box; } will through off the test
[09:43:39] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:43:42] <mikesherov_> throw*
[09:43:44] <rwaldron> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/flexbox/quick/#toc-support
[09:44:02] <mikesherov_> DONT YOU DARE MENTION flexbox here
[09:44:12] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:44:19] <rwaldron> read before you yell
[09:44:43] <mikesherov_> oh, ok
[09:45:00] <DaveMethvin> ok, is this right? To determine the offset of the element we need to take into account its box-sizing, if any, plus quirks mode
[09:45:15] <jaubourg> seems so
[09:45:23] <DaveMethvin> so that's two things, we are only taking one into account atm (quirks mode, via $.support.boxModel)
[09:45:46] <mikesherov_> well, I'm not sure how box-sizing affects offset...
[09:46:20] <DaveMethvin> oh i thougght it affected offset the same way quirks mode did, but i coudl be wrong
[09:46:32] <mikesherov_> I'm not sure.
[09:46:46] <DaveMethvin> basically the way i read it was that ppl decided that it made sense to do dimensions the ie7 way so they created box-sizing
[09:46:53] <mikesherov_> by the way, this just happened: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73334
[09:47:44] <mikesherov_> well, box-sizing is about what "width" is: content-width, or content + padding + border
[09:47:55] <jaubourg> mike; could you like, come and listen?
[09:47:57] <mikesherov_> not sure how that affects offset
[09:48:01] <mikesherov_> Yes, I could
[09:48:03] <jaubourg> (even with mic off)
[09:48:04] <gnarf> mikesherov_: can you listen on skype?
[09:48:07] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg suggested a master bug for box-sizing
[09:48:12] <gnarf> damn you lolbat
[09:48:16] <jaubourg> ?lolbat
[09:48:16] <bot-t> "Curses! it's the LOLBAT!" http://www.pvponline.com/2008/06/30/interlude-the-adventures-of-lolbat/
[09:48:20] <rwaldron> ahahahaha
[09:48:20] <DaveMethvin> k, where do we call?
[09:48:29] <mikesherov_> I need to get on skype, one sec
[09:48:35] <rwaldron> Ghostbusters!
[09:48:50] <gnarf> mikesherov_: im "gnarf37" if you wanna add me
[09:49:17] <mikesherov_> I don't have skype on my laptop
[09:49:23] <mikesherov_> keep talking while I get set up

[09:51:28] <jaubourg> why not block ?7986 with this one?
[09:52:58] <mikesherov_> right, this ticket contains css3 feature detection
[09:53:22] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov_: i'll just do what jaubourg said
[09:54:02] <mikesherov_> OK
[09:57:14] <mikesherov_> ALMOST THERE
[09:58:21] <mikesherov_> skype name: mikesherov

[10:00:48] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/513
[10:01:22] <mikesherov_> why not cssText?
[10:05:14] <mikesherov_> yes
[10:05:52] <mikesherov_> that's a great idea
[10:06:02] <mikesherov_> that's the way to get rid of those strings
[10:06:13] <mikesherov_> also, the border*Width stuff is also in getWH
[10:06:39] <mikesherov_> those deserve to be examined
[10:06:54] <mikesherov_> like, getWH is SO CLOSE to this
[10:06:58] <mikesherov_> well, not *
[10:07:08] <mikesherov_> but using those strings
[10:07:15] <mikesherov_> yeah, definite reuse
[10:07:34] <mikesherov_> corey, I  definitely think you can merge getWH strings with this
[10:07:39] <mikesherov_> the savings would be in getWH
[10:07:48] <mikesherov_> like we steal bytes from getWH
[10:08:02] <mikesherov_> Yeah, I'll do it tonight
[10:08:12] <mikesherov_> IM A MUTE
[10:08:22] <mikesherov_> THERE IS NO GOD
[10:08:38] <mikesherov_> Yeah, corey pulled off of my borderBox one
[10:09:07] <mikesherov_> sure, that function is my best friend
[10:09:23] <mikesherov_> functon doSeomthing
[10:09:45] <mikesherov_> there are unctions in JSHint
[10:10:19] <mikesherov_> brainfuck
[10:11:20] <rwaldron> http://www.freewebs.com/criticjay/DVD.jpg
[10:11:22] <mikesherov_> well, the thing is, it's slow, no?
[10:12:54] <mikesherov_> prolly around 50
[10:13:05] <mikesherov_> not even close a ticket, close a PR
[10:13:09] <mikesherov_> um
[10:13:12] <rwaldron> I pronounce it
[10:13:14] <mikesherov_> motolov
[10:13:15] <rwaldron> Cher-ovv
[10:13:22] <rwaldron> ?
[10:13:24] <mikesherov_> YES
[10:13:24] <rwaldron> no
[10:13:26] <rwaldron> nice
[10:13:35] <jaubourg> OMG
[10:14:02] <mikesherov_> Hooray
[10:14:08] <mikesherov_> I don't care
[10:14:12] <mikesherov_> either way
[10:14:16] <mikesherov_> if it's not getting merged, close it
[10:14:34] <mikesherov_> I thought so
[10:14:48] <mikesherov_> I want to roll it up in a central commit
[10:14:56] <rwaldron> nice
[10:15:27] <mikesherov_> I'll keep the branch
[10:15:32] <mikesherov_> Yes
[10:15:34] <mikesherov_> getWH is my friend
[10:16:45] <mikesherov_> orkel is good at micro-optimizing
[10:18:18] <mikesherov_> close all of the things
[10:18:34] <rwaldron> +1
[10:18:52] <mikesherov_> for checked?
[10:18:58] <mikesherov_> boolean attributes
[10:19:03] <mikesherov_> boolean properties
[10:19:06] <rwaldron> if ( foo.iCanHazAttribute("thing") )
[10:19:37] <mikesherov_> yeah, and so orkel doesn't give up
[10:21:49] <mikesherov_> good PR
[10:22:02] <mikesherov_> new string("") vs. "" is dumb
[10:22:11] <mikesherov_> yeah, makes perfect sense
[10:22:19] <mikesherov_> I hate new String()
[10:23:06] <mikesherov_> does this need more discussion? good PR
[10:23:17] <mikesherov_> NOOO, WHY?
[10:23:48] <mikesherov_> well, if other libraries do bullshit, we shouldn't care about that
[10:23:56] <mikesherov_> some libs extend object.prototype
[10:24:13] <mikesherov_> and we don't do hasOwnProperty
[10:24:19] <timmywil> btw, I don't think we should do 538 unless and until hasAttr gets into core
[10:24:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah but that's the question
[10:24:40] <mikesherov_> um, my next PR kind of sucks
[10:24:41] <DaveMethvin> do we have a ticket for hasAttr on 1.8?
[10:24:44] <timmywil> if it does,  we should not have a private hasAttr
[10:25:05] <timmywil> i believe so, lemme check
[10:25:47] <mikesherov_>  33263    (+33) jquery.min.js.gz
[10:25:54] <timmywil> ah, there was one for 1.7 discussion, which got -1'd http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9396
[10:26:38] <mikesherov_> oh, it fixes a crash? 33 bytes not a big deal
[10:26:38] <DaveMethvin> so it sounds like this should be closed
[10:26:45] <DaveMethvin> this being hasAttr
[10:27:03] <timmywil> yea, the issues are the same.  This would mostly be a perf improvement for modern browsers, but not a big one.
[10:27:19] <timmywil> may not be worth the size.  we can tag for 1.8-discuss or just close it
[10:27:31] <gnarf> timmywil: can you join as a listener in skype?
[10:27:31] <rwaldron> timmywil thanks for the reminder
[10:27:35] <rwaldron> you're the best
[10:27:45] <mikesherov_> bye julian
[10:27:53] <timmywil> gnarf: i can't.  in a meeting
[10:27:59] <timmywil> rwaldron: :)
[10:28:07] <mikesherov_> Well, two things
[10:28:13] <mikesherov_> 1. hardcorded list of elements
[10:28:20] <mikesherov_> 2. not exhaustive list
[10:28:32] <mikesherov_> I would argue that we could do a default display, but that would be slow
[10:28:40] <mikesherov_> and doesn't work for display: hidden
[10:29:03] <mikesherov_> I mean input hidden
[10:29:15] <mikesherov_> yeah, prolly needsdoc
[10:29:24] <mikesherov_> it's just for people who are doing the wrong thing
[10:29:40] <mikesherov_> no, I have that separate too though
[10:30:21] <mikesherov_> I do though want a resolution on this ticket
[10:30:29] <mikesherov_> ok, grat
[10:30:33] <mikesherov_> 10159
[10:30:41] <mikesherov_> well, it'll give it a height!
[10:30:58] <mikesherov_> mathias
[10:30:59] <mikesherov_> mathias
[10:31:05] <mikesherov_> yes
[10:31:29] <mikesherov_> but that's not what this is
[10:31:41] <mikesherov_> here's why
[10:31:57] <mikesherov_> if offset is 0
[10:31:58] <mikesherov_> it attempts a swap
[10:32:06] <mikesherov_> so it makes things that were 0, not zero
[10:32:19] <mikesherov_> a script tag will have height if you set display:block!
[10:32:53] <mikesherov_> this isn't to stop idiots from setting height on script
[10:33:03] <mikesherov_> no, this isn't about that
[10:33:10] <mikesherov_> OK, no problem
[10:33:14] <rwaldron> yeah, stop fuckin' up
[10:33:15] <rwaldron> <3
[10:33:20] <mikesherov_> HAHA
[10:33:36] <mikesherov_> NOOOOES
[10:33:50] <mikesherov_> 10227 is the wrong one to close anyway
[10:33:59] <mikesherov_> 10159 is the one to close
[10:34:05] <mikesherov_> 10227 is different
[10:34:20] <mikesherov_> 10227 is the one rick wants to close because he hates FF3.6
[10:34:30] <mikesherov_> wontfix: needsdocs
[10:34:36] <mikesherov_> 10159: wontfix, needsdocs
[10:36:12] <mikesherov_> so, 10227?
[10:36:52] <mikesherov_> no, wrong one
[10:36:55] <mikesherov_> 10227
[10:37:12] <mikesherov_> yes, I love it
[10:37:15] <mikesherov_> Rick hates it
[10:37:38] <mikesherov_> because he hates adding another fix for ff3.6
[10:37:52] <mikesherov_> yeah
[10:38:07] <mikesherov_> FF3.6 iframes inherit the style of the outer document
[10:38:28] <mikesherov_> body { display: none }
[10:39:08] <mikesherov_> well, some people do it to not display content until everything loaded
[10:39:15] <mikesherov_> sure, jerks
[10:40:13] <mikesherov_> so, I think the PR is sound, it only effects ff3.6
[10:40:16] <mikesherov_> that's the only arguments I got
[10:40:20] <rwaldron> http://viewvc.svn.mozilla.org/vc/libs/product-details/json/firefox_versions.json?view=co
[10:40:21] <mikesherov_> if we say it's EOL
[10:40:22] <mikesherov_> that's fine
[10:40:39] <mikesherov_> I just like submitting PR's
[10:40:42] <mikesherov_> you can take it or not
[10:40:45] <rwaldron> ahahahahahaha
[10:40:50] <rwaldron> the truth!
[10:40:51] <mikesherov_> no problem
[10:41:05] <rwaldron> i just like closing them
[10:41:09] <mikesherov_> have to take off the headphones
[10:41:45] <mikesherov_> one minute
[10:43:57] <gnarf> mikesherov_:  u should mute skype ;)
[10:46:53] <rwaldron> mikesherov_ are you doing an indexed query?
[10:46:58] <gnarf> mikesherov_: its definitely an indexed query
[10:47:21] <rwaldron> gnarf... I think we should index all queries for scoped binding forms.
[10:47:29] <rwaldron> <33333333333
[10:47:37] <mikesherov_> wait, you can here me?
[10:47:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah mute
[10:47:44] <rwaldron> um... nope
[10:50:37] <mikesherov_> and I'm serious
[10:54:03] <mikesherov> I'm here
[10:56:48] <mikesherov_> I'm here
[10:56:50] <mikesherov_> I'm here
[10:57:07] <mikesherov_> I'm completely here
[10:57:09] <mikesherov_> wait
[10:58:09] <mikesherov_> some stuff
[10:58:10] <mikesherov_> I'm here
[10:59:14] <mikesherov__> Derfine before use I'm for
[10:59:37] <mikesherov__> it's totally realiastic
[10:59:54] <mikesherov__> I'll dig up the PR without undef:true
[11:00:15] <mikesherov__> hoisting
[11:00:16] <mikesherov__> darn hoisting
[11:00:20] <mikesherov__> I don't know if they will
[11:00:28] <mikesherov__> there is the promise of maybe hoisting
[11:00:41] <mikesherov__> 24 bytes to be exact
[11:00:44] <mikesherov__> :-P
[11:00:47] <mikesherov__> or so
[11:00:50] <mikesherov__> to be not exact
[11:00:53] <mikesherov__> it's on the PR
[11:01:07] <mikesherov__> well, maybe
[11:01:32] <mikesherov__> I've kept it fresh for a while :-)
[11:01:58] <mikesherov__> ugh, skype sucks at the moment
[11:02:10] <mikesherov__> I'll do either one, pull up the old one
[11:02:10] <mikesherov__> and then "move slowly"
[11:02:19] <necromancer> are jQuery.ajax responses supposed to be independent of the loaded scripts on the page?
[11:02:30] <mikesherov__> or merge this one, I'm fine with both ways
[11:02:41] <necromancer> like, the JS executed in an inline script in an HTML page
[11:03:57] <mikesherov__> call one more time
[11:04:01] <mikesherov__> sorry
[11:04:12] <mikesherov__> on a wired connection now
[11:05:17] <mikesherov__> haha
[11:05:23] <mikesherov__> no, it was ping pong
[11:06:07] <rwaldron> ?slap mikesherov__
[11:06:08] * bot-t slaps mikesherov__ around a bit with a large trout
[11:06:15] <rwaldron> are you sure???
[11:07:38] <mikesherov__> STYLE GUIDE
[11:09:51] <mikesherov__> gibson042 is a smart guy
[11:11:20] <rwaldron> why are you yelling "style guide"?
[11:12:16] <mikesherov__> wait, I want to discuss my other PRs
[11:12:29] <mikesherov__> yup
[11:12:45] <mikesherov__> so
[11:12:50] <mikesherov__> this one has an interesting story
[11:12:59] <mikesherov__> it's now fixed in webkit
[11:13:07] <mikesherov__> https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73334
[11:13:12] <mikesherov__> so it's fixed in webkit
[11:13:21] <mikesherov__> but not for old safari and old chrome
[11:13:28] <mikesherov__> I told paul_irish
[11:13:30] <mikesherov__> he's the internet
[11:13:42] <mikesherov__> ios5
[11:13:46] <rwaldron> ...jesus...
[11:13:53] <mikesherov__> it's dean edwards awesome hack
[11:13:58] <mikesherov__> it's slow
[11:14:05] <mikesherov__> verrry slow
[11:14:19] <mikesherov__> css.js
[11:14:26] <mikesherov__> the dean edwards hack part
[11:14:30] <mikesherov__> causes reflow
[11:14:40] <mikesherov__> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/616/files#L0R280
[11:14:50] <mikesherov__> margin reports percent
[11:14:57] <mikesherov__> other box attributes don't
[11:14:59] <mikesherov__> yes
[11:15:03] <mikesherov__> px vs. percent
[11:15:07] <mikesherov__> now in 1 regex, not 2
[11:15:33] <mikesherov__> yeah, it's super tough
[11:15:39] <mikesherov__> yeah have to awesome hack it
[11:15:48] <mikesherov__> otherwise it's russian doll all the way up
[11:15:53] <mikesherov__> tongue in cheek "awesome"
[11:16:13] <mikesherov__> alternative is, "hey, what is your parent's width?
[11:16:18] <mikesherov__> oh, it's percent, GREAT
[11:16:24] <mikesherov__> only margin
[11:16:32] <mikesherov__> no
[11:16:38] <mikesherov__> http://dev.w3.org/csswg/cssom/#resolved-value
[11:16:54] <mikesherov__> getCOmputedStyle is supposed to return px only for box model attributes
[11:17:02] <mikesherov__> I think it needs to be pulled in
[11:17:12] <mikesherov__> shout loudly about it
[11:17:18] <mikesherov__> in the release notes
[11:17:21] <mikesherov__> I hate the style guide
[11:17:31] <mikesherov__> it should be an autoformattable style
[11:17:35] <mikesherov__> so I don't have to think about it
[11:18:03] <mikesherov__> I can make the changes
[11:18:07] <mikesherov__> it's not a big deal
[11:18:14] <mikesherov__> rick is a hawk
[11:18:32] <mikesherov__> ok, I'll add them
[11:18:42] <mikesherov__> just doc them, I'll add them on the train ride home
[11:18:51] <mikesherov__> DaveMethvin, I'll ping you when I'm done
[11:18:54] <mikesherov__> yeah, I agree
[11:19:05] <mikesherov__> whitespace doesn't matter as long as it's consistent
[11:19:30] <mikesherov__> I'd say we really really really should have a style that be done with an autoformatter
[11:19:51] <mikesherov__> IE9 uncomputed
[11:19:59] <mikesherov__> 610
[11:20:01] <rwaldron> " it should be an autoformattable style" in a perfect world
[11:20:03] <mikesherov__> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/610
[11:20:35] <rwaldron> maybe, one day... we'll jut switch to "js beautify"
[11:20:49] <rwaldron> just*
[11:20:53] <mikesherov__> this PR has the same regex change as the css rollup one
[11:21:09] <mikesherov__> I gotta include it in both
[11:21:14] <mikesherov__> actually, the regex needed to change too
[11:21:33] <mikesherov__> because it caught "10px 10%: as coimputable
[11:21:47] <mikesherov__> so the regex needed to make sure we don't dean edwards hack it
[11:22:17] <mikesherov__> well, any rolled up CSS property actually
[11:22:30] <mikesherov__> checks for number, string not px, then no space
[11:23:13] <mikesherov__> YAY
[11:23:26] <mikesherov__> just remember, it'll conflict with the other CSS rollup
[11:24:00] <mikesherov__> and I'll dredge up the JSHint PR as well
[11:24:03] <mikesherov__> no
[11:24:18] <mikesherov__> it has regex but not the other
[11:24:38] <mikesherov__> hahaha
[11:24:52] <mikesherov__> so, about JSHint, can you just repeat the resolution
[11:25:09] <DaveMethvin> we were going to switch to jshint but not do the reorg?
[11:25:19] <mikesherov__> yes
[11:25:23] <mikesherov__> great
[11:25:43] <mikesherov__> ok guys
[11:25:47] <mikesherov__> I gotta bail
[11:25:52] <mikesherov__> thanks for putting up with me!
[12:06:10] <gibson042> .
[12:11:29] <DaveMethvin> hey gibson042
[12:12:19] <DaveMethvin> i like your pull request: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/608
[12:12:47] <gibson042> thanks so much
[12:13:37] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to land it tonight, did you feel like it was better before you made the second set of changes?
[12:13:50] <DaveMethvin> or are you good with the final outcome?
[12:14:07] <gibson042> I'm really happy with the final outcome
[12:14:31] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.access is a beast no matter how you look at it, but it's pretty impressive that you managed to squeeze that much out of it
[12:14:38] <gibson042> back-and-forth with the core team was very valuable for honing the concept
[12:15:13] <DaveMethvin> ok, just wanted to check with you before I landed it
[12:17:56] <gibson042> did I go about everything correctly from a technical perspective? I'm new to git and github
[12:18:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah it looks pretty good style wise, i'll take a scan through it before the commit
[13:19:08] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: regarding https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/615 ... does this mean ticket 10867 is dead and $.extend(false, obj, obj2) will remain equivalent to $.extend({}, obj, obj2) ?
[13:19:29] <DaveMethvin> yes, i think it's better to document that than change behavior
[13:20:07] <gibson042> so the resolution will be an update to http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/ ?
[13:20:34] <DaveMethvin> well technically there is nothing wrong with the current documentation but we can add something that says "don't use false"
[13:20:41] <gibson042> got it
[13:20:43] <gibson042> thanks for the info

[16:01:59] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[16:02:06] <mikesherov> next time I'll make sure I have a mic
[16:02:50] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell gibson042 congrats on getting your PR merged
[16:02:50] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[16:11:17] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: found a bug?
[16:11:49] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: whats up?
[16:12:21] <DaveMethvin> or mikesherov_
[16:12:32] <DaveMethvin> i haven't checked the jenkins run
[16:12:43] <mikesherov_> not sure where it was introduced, but I'm getting a failing test on "http://jquery/test/index.html?filter=attributes%3A%20prop(String%2C%20Object)"
[16:12:53] <mikesherov_> can you run that?
[16:12:54] <DaveMethvin> all browsers?
[16:13:00] <mikesherov_> um, at least in chrome
[16:13:15] <mikesherov_> let me double check one more time:
[16:13:22] <DaveMethvin> works in chrome
[16:13:35] <DaveMethvin> works in ff8
[16:13:36] <mikesherov_> passes in FF
[16:13:54] <mikesherov_> 16.0.912.59 beta-m
[16:13:56] <mikesherov_> chrome
[16:14:04] <DaveMethvin> works in safari
[16:14:17] <mikesherov_> hmmm
[16:14:22] <DaveMethvin> ie9 too
[16:14:32] <DaveMethvin> i ran it locally with all those commits before i pushed
[16:14:36] <DaveMethvin> checked ie7 as well
[16:14:40] <mikesherov_> actually, it isn't even in the merges from today
[16:14:59] <DaveMethvin> try running incognito
[16:15:09] <DaveMethvin> sometimes plugins cause strange things to happen
[16:15:20] <mikesherov_> yeah, ran incognito
[16:15:21] <mikesherov_> works
[16:15:24] <mikesherov_> that's weird
[16:15:32] <mikesherov_> maybe it's from the skype plugin
[16:15:41] <DaveMethvin> i get a few different fails in chrome if i don't
[16:15:50] <DaveMethvin> one of them is a check for an ie8 problem!
[16:16:05] <mikesherov_> good tip, thanks
[16:16:09] <DaveMethvin> it does seem to depend on the specific plugins yo have
[16:16:15] <DaveMethvin> like i have adblock
[16:16:37] <DaveMethvin> so i still have a few to land but i just got out of a meeting, gotta get dinner
[16:16:56] <DaveMethvin> you on the train mikesherov_?
[16:21:58] <mikesherov_> Yes
[16:22:37] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: btw, just found some JSHint violations in the things we landed today
[16:22:39] <mikesherov_> will be part of the PR
[16:22:48] <mikesherov_> JSLint just misses tons of stuff
[16:23:20] <DaveMethvin> well i'm glad we are switching
[16:23:48] <mikesherov_> lol
[16:32:18] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: updated the JSHint PR:https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/602
[16:32:22] <mikesherov_> now undef:true free
[16:39:00] <DaveMethvin>  mikesherov_: actually jslint didn't miss that one problem, i just forgot to run the makefile! :/
[16:39:22] <DaveMethvin> two of those vars need to be moved inside the function
[16:41:14] <mikesherov_> OK
[16:41:20] <mikesherov_> then I'll look at it again
[16:41:24] <mikesherov_> brb
[16:41:46] <mikesherov_> do I need to make a change, or will you fix in the merge?

[18:53:09] <mikesheroc> DaveMethvin: I see you made the style changes for me on 616
[18:53:13] <mikesheroc> thanks!
[18:53:29] <DaveMethvin> sure, np, it was SUCH HEAVY LIFTING :P
[18:53:38] <DaveMethvin> i am getting my github practice in
[18:53:48] <mikesheroc> cool
[18:53:55] <mikesheroc> so about that JSHint thing
[18:53:56] <DaveMethvin> git cherry-pick --no-commit xxxx
[18:54:05] <DaveMethvin> yeha
[18:54:20] <mikesheroc> you said there was a real bug there?
[18:54:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that commit i did in data.js fixed a problem i should have seen
[18:55:05] <DaveMethvin> but i had forgotten to run make
[18:55:41] <DaveMethvin> this is going to be even more fun when we have closure compiler
[18:56:01] <mikesheroc> Woah, someone finally beat Rick for a new isWindow?!?!
[18:56:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah i kept having flashbacks that there was a problem but when i would go back to look it was okay
[18:56:51] <DaveMethvin> i am nervous about it but couldn't think of a reason why it would break
[18:57:36] <mikesheroc> yeah
[18:58:02] <mikesheroc> My suggestion would have been to make the unit tests PURPOSELY fail when using an obj with a setInterval property
[18:58:17] <mikesheroc> so people wouldn't be follish enough to submit new PR's about isWindow
[18:58:23] <mikesheroc> foolish*
[18:58:40] <DaveMethvin> isWindow is the old isNumeric
[18:58:58] <DaveMethvin> why is it that the simplest apis get the most attention?
[18:59:09] <DaveMethvin> simplest stuff, in general
[18:59:26] <DaveMethvin> i am so tired of commits to cache the loop count
[19:00:07] <mikesheroc> well, I think it's Dev's trying to break in
[19:00:10] <mikesheroc> leave their name on jQuery
[19:00:19] <mikesheroc> so they go after something they understand easily
[19:00:28] <mikesheroc> it's what I did :-)
[19:01:22] <DaveMethvin> hey someone rewrite effects!
[19:01:39] <DaveMethvin> here you go, mike, rewrite manipulation!
[19:01:58] <mikesheroc> Well, I'll stick with css bugs for now
[19:02:07] <mikesheroc> :-P
[19:02:11] <DaveMethvin> i was looking at that a couple of weeks ago and it was scary how much of it i no longer recognized
[19:02:23] <mikesheroc> Oh, so, one other thing
[19:02:30] <mikesheroc> sizzle has a PR that deals with JSHint
[19:02:53] <mikesheroc> if you're going to merge JSHint, you should merge my sizzle PR too
[19:03:13] <DaveMethvin> so is that PR ready to go now?
[19:03:24] <mikesheroc> just pushing the rebase right now
[19:03:28] <DaveMethvin> k
[19:03:41] <mikesheroc> hmmm
[19:03:47] <mikesheroc> actually, somethign is weird
[19:03:51] <DaveMethvin> oh, hmmm isn't ever good
[19:04:06] <DaveMethvin> i gotta run for about a half hour
[19:04:23] <mikesheroc> k, I'll be here
[19:04:29] <mikesheroc> I think I added a weird character
[19:05:04] <mikesheroc> yeah, I borked data
[19:06:33] <mikesheroc> utf8 character encoding
[19:06:52] <mikesheroc> K, that's bad
[19:06:55] <mikesheroc> PR is ready to go!!!
[19:07:03] <mikesheroc> I fixed it
[19:25:37] <mikesheroc> so, now I'm trying to figure out why we even still have jQuery.boxModel
[19:25:46] <mikesheroc> it was deprecated in jQuery 1.3
[19:28:06] <mikesheroc> aaronasachimp's PR is just fine actually
[19:28:13] <mikesheroc> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/406
[19:30:10] <mikesheroc> also, regarding the PR's that were closed as needsdocs, do I need to follow up with addy osmani, or does my involvement end here?
[19:35:31] <mikesheroc> bot-t: tell gibson042 the PR's related to the css regexs are now merged, feel free to submit a PR for 10858, and please include unit tests
[19:35:32] <bot-t> mikesheroc, Okay.
[19:36:36] <mikesheroc> bot-t: tell gibson042 I've also assigned the ticket to you: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10858
[19:36:37] <bot-t> mikesheroc, Okay.
[19:45:59] <mikesheroc> rwaldron: hello
[19:46:09] <rwaldron> yo
[19:46:14] <mikesheroc> Hey, I had a question about the boxModel tickets that I'm rolling up
[19:46:45] <mikesheroc> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/406 is one
[19:47:23] <mikesheroc> but that's the only one?
[19:48:44] <rwaldron> i dunno
[19:48:52] <rwaldron> i'm tired
[19:49:23] <mikesheroc> ok
[19:49:51] <rwaldron> so what's up?
[19:50:00] <rwaldron> question?
[19:51:00] <mikesheroc> that was the question
[19:51:25] <rwaldron> oh
[19:51:30] <rwaldron> sorry, i dont know
[19:51:59] <mikesheroc> no problem
[19:52:20] <mikesheroc> because on a second look, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/406 seems fine as is
[19:52:28] <mikesheroc> I missed the skype part of that discussion
[19:52:34] <mikesheroc> what was wrong with that PR?
[19:57:35] <mikesheroc> gnarf: you around?
[19:58:32] <mikesheroc> ok, I gotta hit the hay, I guess it's up to you, bot-t
[19:59:42] <mikesheroc> bot-t: tell DaveMethvin I'm not sure what was wrong with https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/406 except for possibly using a better test for when to use docElem scrollTop stuff instead of jQuery.boxModel
[19:59:43] <bot-t> mikesheroc, Okay.
[20:01:31] <mikesheroc> bot-t: tell DaveMethvin also, I'm not sure what other fixes I need to roll up into https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/528 (10413) besides for https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/406 (7986)
[20:01:32] <bot-t> mikesheroc, Okay.
[20:02:22] <mikesheroc> bot-t: tell DavMethvin the trac ticket for 10413 says it should also solve for 7986, which I'm fine with, but I think the existing PR was OK upon a closer look
[20:02:23] <bot-t> mikesheroc, Okay.
[20:02:49] <mikesheroc> how obedient of you, bot-t
[20:02:49] <bot-t> mikesheroc, Is that a question?
[20:03:05] <mikesheroc> LOL
[20:04:14] <mikesheroc> bot-t: tell DaveMethvin, if you could, just summarize responses to these questions on the trac ticket, and I'd be much obliged
[20:04:15] <bot-t> mikesheroc, Okay.
