[16:08:57] <swissspidy> Hi there, Pascal Birchler from WordPress here. We received some reports about a bug affecting jQuery 1.12 (https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3065) and wanted to talk re: joining efforts. Who could we talk to? Please let me know! :)
[16:10:55] <DaveMethvin> hi swissspidy yeah it looks like there are two tickets, sort of related
[16:11:05] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3043
[16:12:08] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at it myself, do you have some insight?
[16:12:36] <DaveMethvin> we have a few fixes to put in the next releases but are hoping to get a 3.0 beta out soon 
[16:12:45] <DaveMethvin> which is taking a lot of time the past week or so
[16:13:14] <DaveMethvin> oic you were in the ticket as well
[16:14:38] <swissspidy> Yeah I was trying to track down the bug which causes the media modal in WordPress to break in some cases.
[16:14:39] <swissspidy> https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36533
[16:15:04] <swissspidy> Great to hear you're all on it!
[16:15:52] <swissspidy> We're currently discussing whether we should wait for 1.12.4 (1.x comes bundled with WordPress) or try to fix the CSS.
[16:16:42] <DaveMethvin> as i understand it the problem is due to styling the bare `table` element which confuses one of our feature detects
[16:16:58] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at the code to see how that can be fixed
[16:17:38] <DaveMethvin> so it might take a week or two for a resolution
[16:18:58] <swissspidy> OK, cool. An approximate date already helps!
[16:19:36] <swissspidy> 3043 seems to have a promising pull request. Happy to test it in the next few days. Hope it resolves the other issue as well, or at least makes it easier to do so.
