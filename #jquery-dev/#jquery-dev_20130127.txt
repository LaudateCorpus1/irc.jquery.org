[05:25:29] <guy> Why ubind/bind methods aliases are not marked as deprecated?
[06:03:07] <gnarf> guy: ?
[06:05:49] <Iszak> How come the current tagged version of jQuery uses grunt 0.4.0 yet.. there is no tagged version for 0.4.0?
[06:05:57] <Iszak> So I can't install grunt 0.4.0
[06:06:40] <Iszak> Sorry, I mean jQuery 1.9.0 to be precise.
[06:07:45] <guy> gnarf: what's up?
[06:09:12] <Iszak> Hmm seems I need to install the dev version of it.

[06:24:14] <DaveMethvin> Iszak: did you get it ironed out?
[06:24:31] <Iszak> DaveMethvin not really, I couldn't install the module as a dev dependency, it errored.
[06:26:12] <DaveMethvin> Iszak: the whole grunt version thing is pretty hosed, several plugins got released with the same version but different apis
[06:26:23] <DaveMethvin> i just spent a lot of yesterday trying to get it ironed out
[06:26:39] <DaveMethvin> but i may not have gotten it all right, i was working with two branches at the same time
[06:26:47] <DaveMethvin> and it's easy to get confused
[06:27:09] <DaveMethvin> so let me try removing node_modules and reinstalling on 1.9.0
[06:29:49] <DaveMethvin> Iszak: seems to work for me ... what exactly is not working/
[06:33:04] <gibson042> .
[06:33:12] <DaveMethvin> hey gibson042
[06:35:12] <DaveMethvin> wow a PERFECT run! http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2416
[06:35:35] <Iszak> Sigh, time to reinstall.
[06:35:46] <Iszak> DaveMethvin thanks for trying to help, got to go reinstall because OSX is being a piece of shit, thanks.
[06:35:47] <DaveMethvin> Iszak: try rm -rf node_modules
[06:36:28] <DaveMethvin> "State of the Swarm": EMPTY http://swarm.jquery.org/
[06:42:51] <gibson042> woo!
[06:43:12] <DaveMethvin> obviously the swarm took Sunday off
[06:43:18] <DaveMethvin> and saturday too
[06:43:49] <DaveMethvin> that won't stop me, i'll just keep committing and deal with the consequences later
[06:44:07] <gibson042> apparently, one can only fail 1.9 so many times before Jenkins gives up on it
[06:44:17] <DaveMethvin> let that be a lesson to us
[06:44:46] <DaveMethvin> turns out that typeof elem.getAttribute ==="undefined" is needed for IE9 b/c of xml 
[06:45:33] <gibson042> it's so depressing to see all those 2.0 changes get backed out
[06:45:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:45:51] <DaveMethvin> fortunately they tend to be one liners
[06:45:55] <DaveMethvin> and not the huge shims
[06:46:46] <gibson042> yeah
[06:47:12] <gibson042> so, what's up with grunt-compare-size? is this another grunt rc<N> mess?
[06:47:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's rwaldron's plugin and just needs an update
[06:47:43] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to have it be less verbose anyway
[06:47:52] <DaveMethvin> it gets cray when you start dealing with 6 branches
[06:48:36] <gibson042> did you have anything specific in mind? I can't publish to npm, but I am admin on the repo
[06:49:39] <DaveMethvin> all we really care about is the min/gzip size, so instead of like 5 lines per branch just one line with the min/gzip
[06:51:01] <DaveMethvin> so on that typeof/"undefined" problem caused by uglify, i guess we'll need to do the workaround you proposed with "undefined" in a var
[06:51:15] <DaveMethvin> that's enough to fool uglify/
[06:51:17] <DaveMethvin> ?
[06:52:17] <gibson042> that's almost possible right now; if we send compare_size only `["dist/jquery.min.js"]` it will output a line for that and one for gzipped
[06:52:34] <gibson042> but yes; having strundefined is enough to fool uglify
[06:53:21] <gibson042> are you not seeing different since https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/ec9b38a34fb9bd81d1903cf12b69466f699abca5 ?
[06:53:42] <gibson042> oh, n/m, that was for 1.9
[06:53:57] <DaveMethvin> right, and ie9 needs it

[07:03:50] <gibson042> DaveMethvin what's the ticket for this IE9 xml bug?
[07:04:16] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure there is one

[07:30:13] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: looks like that fixed it
[07:30:29] <DaveMethvin> it's funny, if i run the tests one at a time from the drop down it seems they run faster
[07:30:34] <DaveMethvin> or maybe it's just my imagination

[13:21:45] <mikesherov> that's it, I'm fed up
[13:22:01] <mikesherov> I'm proposing a replacement for getComputedStyle()
[13:22:03] <mikesherov> http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Jan/0492.html
[13:22:09] <mikesherov> paul_irish: ^
[13:24:17] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i agree the browsers know a lot that they could tell us but there's no spec for conveying the info
[13:24:26] <DaveMethvin> it's crazy for us to need to do acrobatics
[13:24:30] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I'm proposing one here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-style/2013Jan/0492.html
[13:24:56] <mikesherov> would love a retweet or your thoughts on the ML
[13:25:13] <DaveMethvin> being able to get the default/initial/etc style woudl be VERY handy
[13:25:58] <DaveMethvin> things like getting the "width" of an element that is skewed by transforms is another one
[13:26:13] <DaveMethvin> the original unskewed width does few people any good
[13:26:25] <mikesherov> https://twitter.com/mikesherov/status/295643911358140416
[13:26:40] <mikesherov> well, transforms are even another layer
[13:27:10] <DaveMethvin> and yet again the browser has all the info but there's no api to tell us
[13:27:16] <mikesherov> yeah
[13:27:33] <mikesherov> well, it should be able to tell us everything about the transform
[13:28:00] <DaveMethvin> and then people want us to magically give them the transformed width in .width() even when the browser doesn't
[13:28:01] <mikesherov> but that is separate from "width"
[13:28:29] <mikesherov> transforms is something we should support the day we have correct access to the info
[13:28:40] <DaveMethvin> oh good, NEVER :D
[13:28:48] <mikesherov> haha
[13:29:02] <DaveMethvin> getTransformedComputedStyle
[13:29:12] <mikesherov> well transforms are styles
[13:29:19] <mikesherov> styles != dimensions
[13:29:26] <DaveMethvin> trye
[13:29:27] <DaveMethvin> true
[13:29:44] <mikesherov> our dimension library just needs to make it clear that it only deals with old school dimension css properties
[13:29:48] <mikesherov> for now
[13:30:07] <mikesherov> what's problematic is our usage of getBoundingClientRect, which comingles new and old
[13:30:12] <mikesherov> even though we haven't yet

[17:25:18] <Afflicto> I was sent here from #jquery, I just pushed this jquery plugin to my github but it's not showing up in the jQuery plugin (I have added the post-receive hook). Here's my repo: https://github.com/afflicto/jQuery.pairAttr - thanks in advance.
[17:28:46] <gnarf> Afflicto: check http://plugins.jquery.com/error.log
[17:29:04] <gnarf> search for your repo name
[17:29:08] <gnarf> it should show you all the errors
[17:29:25] <gnarf> just fyi, youll have to bump to new version numbers and new tags

[17:35:36] <Afflicto> aah great stuff! error log is nice to have :P
[17:43:22] <Afflicto> gnarf: So I renamed my pairAttr.jquery.json to lowercase, but it is still mixed case on the remote repo. How do I tell git that I renamed it? :\
[17:56:58] <Afflicto> yay! I managed to do it finally! =D
[18:17:22] <gnarf> Afflicto: yay

[22:22:52] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin|away: To get some clients going when there are no pending jobs either re-trigger a job in Jenkins (click "Build now" in Jenkins when logged-in), or in TestSwarm "Reset all runs" within a job.
[22:23:12] <Krinkle> Basically either reset a job already in TestSwarm, or make Jenkins re-submit an old one.
