[11:40:46] <paul_irish> nobody knows about modular jquery builds
[11:41:02] <paul_irish> worth making a blog post about them and the three ways to get them?
[11:45:30] <ajpiano> paul_irish: just asked DaveMethvin about it
[11:45:40] <ajpiano> we both kinda think it's a little premature
[11:45:50] <ajpiano> once 2.0 is out, we'll be more modular etc
[11:45:57] <ajpiano> and things will be a lot more settled
[11:46:07] <ajpiano> whereas what we have now is kind of the v 0.1 of modular jquery
[11:46:12] <DaveMethvin> probably too early to talk about what we will do there
[11:46:29] <DaveMethvin> and what we have is documented in the release info and the README.md
[11:47:09] <paul_irish> ajpiano: okok

[12:51:51] <mikesherov> snover: yt?
[12:52:36] <mikesherov> I'm trying to update http://bugs.jquery.com/chrome/ticketgraph/ticketgraph.js I've modified it on the server but it seems like trac is caching
[12:52:47] <mikesherov> any idea of how to clear that cache
[12:55:04] <snover> mikesherov: restart trac
[12:55:27] <mikesherov> snover: did that. It reloads the python but doesn't effect the .js files
[12:55:47] <mikesherov> is there an internal trac cache for plugins?
[12:55:55] <snover> i have no remembering of this
[12:56:04] <mikesherov> ok, thanks anyway!

[15:09:12] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: 1.9.0 live now. also got someone else to help with maintenance so hopefully response time++
[15:09:14] <paul_irish> or -- rather, :)
[15:17:46] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: how are you guys using new vs. open in the tracker?  I assume this ticket is "open" because YOU filed it, but it's marked as new… http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7406
[15:48:46] <snover> mikesherov: unless someone worked on it some more the workflow plugin isn’t smart enough to set state to open automatically based on a user’s permissions
[15:48:52] <snover> so if someone forgets…
[16:19:08] <mikesherov> snover: sure. I'm just confirming that open is what I think it is… i.e. the same thing as it is on the core tracker
[16:44:14] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: We use new vs. open exactly as you'd expect, but we just started doing so very recently.
[16:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> So there are lots of valid tickets that are still marked as new.
[16:44:26] <mikesherov> K
[16:44:27] <mikesherov> cool
[16:44:51] <snover> scott_gonzalez: how’s the summit?
[16:45:25] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Pretty good. We got a ton of tickets triaged and I've got an inbox full of pull requests :-)
[16:45:34] <snover> that sounds like the best kind of horror
[16:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[16:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> I need to get through all these PRs so I can make all the changes for sites that I promised to other tables at the summit :-P
[16:52:13] <snover> oof.
[18:54:18] <mikesherov> gnarf: when you get a minute, can you just confirm that http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7110 is a dupe of http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7041
[21:21:26] <DaveMethvin> .
[21:25:20] <ryanneufeld> .
