[17:32:44] <DaveMethvin> IT'S ALIVE
[17:34:44] <DaveMethvin> thanks Krinkle, i've got some ice cream here i can mail you
[17:39:01] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Hehe, I'm still waiting for the api.jquery.com build to start though, I don't see it yet.
[17:39:09] <Krinkle> I see it working for qunitjs.com though which is a nice start
[17:39:28] <Krinkle> maybe the webhook for that one is wrong?
[17:39:54] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Can you check the settings/webhook for https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com and https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com and see if any difference stands out?
[17:40:03] <DaveMethvin> sure
[17:42:20] <DaveMethvin> strange
[17:42:31] <DaveMethvin> both are talking to builder-01.ops.jquery.net
[17:42:41] <DaveMethvin> but api.jquery.com gets a We couldnâ€™t deliver this payload: Service Timeout
[17:43:15] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Same port and all?
[17:43:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[17:43:40] <DaveMethvin> last successful run on api was way back in  â€¦ 2016-07-25 07:43:57
[17:43:50] <DaveMethvin> if that helps
[17:47:32] <Krinkle> Hm.. no nothing stands out around that date
[17:47:43] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Maybe one more time? Just to verify it's not intermittent.
[17:47:45] <Krinkle> (another tag)
[17:47:58] <Krinkle> I don't see any difference in configuration for api.jq and api.qunit
[17:48:04] <Krinkle> On our side, either
[17:48:27] <DaveMethvin> btw similar fail on contribute.jquery.org, last good  â€¦ 2016-07-27 16:34:26
[17:49:04] <DaveMethvin> jquery.com last success  â€¦ 2016-07-14 12:50:15
[17:49:35] <DaveMethvin> but stage is working?

[17:50:27] <DaveMethvin> sorry i have to run but will be back later
[17:50:28] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Are there two web hooks configured for each?
[17:50:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah one for each
[17:50:38] <Krinkle> Or is stage doing pull instead of push?
[17:50:39] <DaveMethvin> stage is okay
[17:50:41] <Krinkle> Okay, good. so they work the same way
[17:50:45] <Krinkle> Alright, thanks
[17:51:01] <Krinkle> I'll poke at it a bit further and then have to go as well. Will check back in a day or two.
[17:51:47] <Krinkle> yay, it works now!
