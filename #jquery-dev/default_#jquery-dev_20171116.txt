[07:30:19] <saptaks> Hello everyone.
[07:30:26] <saptaks> So I was trying to solve this issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3808
[07:30:45] <saptaks> I have debugged the problem but am not sure how to go about solving it.
[07:30:59] <saptaks> Need some guidance.
[07:33:44] <saptaks> I found out that even though it is a border box, on resizing, the valueIsBorderBox flag becomes false, because support.boxSizingReliable() becomes false, as a result boxModelAdjustment gives some weird results
[07:43:25] <saptaks> So I logged the values of boxModelAdjustment. Once on resizing. And next time resizing and reloading the page.

[23:47:02] <saptaks> gibson042: can you help me with this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3808 ? support.boxSizingReliable returns false on zooming because the expected value is a little more than the derived value.
[23:47:37] <saptaks> The problem gets solved by rounding, but should we round and if so, then till what decimal place?
[23:49:25] <gibson042> to the unit should be sufficient, but really it's just "whatever works without bloating the file size"
[23:53:24] <saptaks> gibson042: I am not sure about unit preserving. Can you maybe point to somewhere where I can read up about it? Right now 2 decimal places works fine.
[23:54:58] <gibson042> to the unit means zero decimal places; equivalent to Math.round
[23:55:18] <saptaks> gibson042: oh. ok.
