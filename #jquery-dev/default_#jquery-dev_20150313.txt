[12:43:36] <lawliet> Hi! I'm new here and looking forward to contributing to jQuery. Is there any specific page for easy hacks?
[12:49:11] <lawliet> Can anyone help? :|
[12:54:03] <arthurvr> lawliet: Hi!
[12:54:27] <arthurvr> lawliet: Be sure to start on http://contribute.jquery.org/ :D
[12:54:58] <lawliet> What is the work flow?
[12:55:33] <arthurvr> lawliet: Depends on what project youâ€™re interested in contributing to? Core, ui, mobile, documentation, ...
[12:56:42] <lawliet> Core and ui..
[12:58:44] <arthurvr> lawliet: Okay, thanks. For core you can check out the open tickets at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues, and for UI you can find them on bugs.jqueryui.com :D
[12:59:07] <arthurvr> lawliet: Youâ€™re free to take every ticket which somebody else isnâ€™t already working on :)
[13:00:36] <arthurvr> lawliet: Besides from contribute.jquery.org, be sure to checkout the project-specific `contributing.md` file as well.
[13:01:24] <lawliet> Okay, for starters, how do I find the easy bugs for core and UI? I want to work my way up :)
[13:03:26] <arthurvr> lawliet: I think itâ€™s better to find the issues you think you can fix, I canâ€™t really think about â€˜easyâ€™ ones atm :D Generally the low-hanging fruit is documentation, tho
[13:04:13] <arthurvr> lawliet: If you have any questions, the team is hanging out in this channel and in #jqueryui-dev
[13:04:37] <lawliet> okay, much thanks! :)
[16:23:47] <ashg1910> vagrant up isn't working and says:
[16:23:49] <ashg1910> The guest machine entered an invalid state while waiting for it
[16:23:50] <ashg1910> to boot. Valid states are 'starting, running'. The machine is in the
[16:23:50] <ashg1910> 'poweroff' state. Please verify everything is configured
[16:23:50] <ashg1910> properly and try again.
[16:23:50] <ashg1910> If the provider you're using has a GUI that comes with it,
[16:23:50] <ashg1910> it is often helpful to open that and watch the machine, since the
[16:23:50] <ashg1910> GUI often has more helpful error messages than Vagrant can retrieve.
[16:23:50] <ashg1910> For example, if you're using VirtualBox, run `vagrant up` while the
[16:23:51] <ashg1910> VirtualBox GUI is open.
