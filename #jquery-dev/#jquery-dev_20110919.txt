[03:53:54] <addyosmani> :)
[03:56:11] <jaubourg> I hate it that I cannot edit the meeting doc
[03:56:42] <jaubourg> especially when I won't be able to be at the meeting yet need to convey things :P
[03:59:16] <addyosmani> if only you could have bot-t do that for you :P
[04:00:15] <addyosmani> eg.? tell #jquery-meeting msg 17:00 CST
[04:04:04] <jaubourg> heh
[04:04:19] <jaubourg> that would be awesome and a bit confusing for the one hosting the meeting :P
[04:06:46] <addyosmani> lol.
[04:06:49] <addyosmani> very true
[04:07:10] <addyosmani> hows the prep for that presentation on introducing jQuery going?
[04:16:31] <jaubourg> errr... nil, nada, nothing? Still need to prep my jqcon prez :/
[04:16:49] <jaubourg> then I'll have the Deferred prez for Wakanday... then the into

[05:30:53] <jaubourg> =)
[05:30:57] <jaubourg> sup?
[06:27:33] <timmywil> hi
[06:33:15] <DaveMethvin> hi
[06:33:45] <timmywil> HAI
[06:34:10] <DaveMethvin> O HAI
[06:55:49] <jaubourg> OH HAI
[06:56:51] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin, timmywil: I cannot be at the meeting but I'd like to request a code review for $.Callbacks: are the flag names good enough? Are the one implemented all useful? Is there any missing? Is the code OK?
[06:57:08] <jaubourg> I'd love if someone could look into that at one point or another
[06:57:41] <timmywil> jaubourg: will do :)
[06:58:27] <jaubourg> thanks a bunch timmy
[07:07:05] <gnarf> omg
[07:07:31] <gnarf> jaubourg: if you're on the bugs list or whatever you should be able to edit the meeting notes
[07:11:17] <jzaefferer> jaubourg: where's the $.Callbacks code?
[07:11:28] <gnarf> its on 1.7/combined
[07:12:06] <gnarf> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.7/combined/src/callbacks.js
[07:18:10] <jzaefferer> that's a very silly branch name, like you can't decide when to fork a 1-6-stable branch and start with 1.7 in master :p
[07:19:14] <jzaefferer> is there a (group of) commit(s) that show how this affects the ajax and deferred modules?
[07:20:36] <jzaefferer> is there some motivation documented for all the various flags?
[07:20:36] <jzaefferer> jaubourg?
[07:20:44] <gnarf> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/b47e8c2785da05bfb5452e381db65c62e9f4cdd5
[07:20:45] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by timmywil (6d, 13h ago): $.Callbacks, $.Topic and notify/progress on $.Deferred.
[07:21:31] <gnarf> thats callbacks/topic/ajax/progress/etc
[07:21:52] <jzaefferer> $.Topic?
[07:22:02] <gnarf> not landing, just a demo i think
[07:22:07] <gnarf> its a pub/sub
[07:22:26] <timmywil> see next commit. $.Topic will be a plugin
[07:23:22] <jzaefferer> also wondering why Deferred gets even more methods, instead of less
[07:23:36] <timmywil> less?
[07:23:53] <timmywil> is there some method you don't like?
[07:24:39] <gnarf> it adds progress to the generic deferred ?
[07:24:53] <gnarf> thats like +2 methods
[07:25:16] <gnarf> +4 actually, progress/removeProgress/notify/notifyWith
[07:26:00] <gnarf> oh hey
[07:26:11] <gnarf> i didn't notice that the removeDone, etc weren't there before :)
[07:26:51] <jzaefferer> what about notify?
[07:26:51] <jzaefferer> anyway, is there some documentation besides the code?
[07:27:08] <rwaldron> I love code reviews
[07:27:16] <timmywil> it will need to be documented before release
[07:28:15] <gnarf> rwaldron: thanks for being my whitespace second eyes
[07:28:20] <rwaldron> <3
[07:28:20] <gnarf> ++
[07:28:28] <rwaldron> thanks for writing awesome fixes
[07:28:37] <jzaefferer> timmywil: I'm looking for usecases, why are we adding that?
[07:28:48] <jzaefferer> not for usage documentation for the end user
[07:28:53] <rwaldron> i REALLY liked the template-ish thing you did
[07:29:06] <timmywil> jzaefferer: adding which? progress?
[07:29:12] <gnarf> rwaldron: yeah, that cssHooks[].expand function felt pretty inspired
[07:29:25] <timmywil> gnarf: yes it did
[07:29:30] <gnarf> timmywil: i actually managed to "make it smaller" - dunno if you looked at it yet
[07:29:30] <jzaefferer> timmywil: more deferred methods, $.Callbacks, whatever else
[07:30:13] <gnarf> jzaefferer: progress is needed for CORS
[07:30:16] <timmywil> $.Callbacks was proposed as a way to clean up $._Deferred and generalize callback lists.
[07:30:36] <gnarf> jzaefferer: $.Callbacks has uses outside of Deferred, it could easily be used to replace queues, events, etc
[07:30:48] <timmywil> jzaefferer: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9398
[07:34:47] <gnarf> timmywil: any chance we might be able to poke http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8627 into 1.7 too? it worked in previous versions - causes some bugs over in my UI effects trac too
[07:35:38] <timmywil> gnarf: that worked in previous versions?
[07:35:53] <gnarf> supposedly, pre 1.5 it probably assumed normal was "0"
[07:36:00] <timmywil> ah
[07:36:12] <gnarf> now its NaN
[07:36:37] <timmywil> makes sense. yea we can get that in.
[07:36:54] <timmywil> we can always fix bugs :)
[07:37:19] <gnarf> I'm gonna grab ownership on that one
[07:37:25] <gnarf> just so i don't lose track of it
[07:37:33] <timmywil> kk
[07:38:46] <jzaefferer> gnarf timmywil: how about keeping $.Callbacks an impelemntation detail for 1.7? would allow you to overhaul it based on the needs of $.deferred, instead of not changing it or breaking everyones code in 1.8
[07:39:02] <jzaefferer> still looking for usecases for all those flags...
[07:39:13] <rwaldron> timmywil do you already have something in mind for that ticket you filed about size?
[07:39:47] <timmywil> rwaldron: in my excavations into qwery, I noticed they used something called smoosh.  I'd imagine a similar implementation
[07:40:15] <rwaldron> timmywil http://gyazo.com/eba36c5b96b9afd469f4589db5ea6dd9.png
[07:40:21] <timmywil> gave you the number of bytes you've added for each built file
[07:41:17] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer timmywil, i share the concerns about $.Callbacks ... seems like it's got a lot of options
[07:41:21] <timmywil> rwaldron: that has good info, but I'm also looking for a comparison so I can see if I made jquery smaller or bigger
[07:41:53] <gnarf> timmywil: I generally do a make ; wc dist/jquery.min.js ; git checkout master; make; wc dist/jquery.min.js
[07:42:01] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, jzaefferer: yea, I'm not sure about all of the flags
[07:42:03] <rwaldron> timmywil yeah, it could easily do that
[07:42:14] <rwaldron> I wrote this using node-stats
[07:42:26] <rwaldron> i just give it a list of files to compare
[07:42:28] <gnarf> like i know that the 1.7-internal-data-2 is 62 bytes smaller minified than its base :)
[07:43:06] <rwaldron> timmywil smoosh gets annoying
[07:43:09] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, timmywil, rwaldron, what gzip options best represent the ones used by web servers? that would be the best final size to compare
[07:43:11] <rwaldron> no jok
[07:43:13] <rwaldron> joke*
[07:43:40] <timmywil> rwaldron: lol, i was a little annoyed by the playfully pretentious commenting
[07:44:08] <gnarf> i remember someone had a jQuery size chart
[07:44:14] <rwaldron> matjas
[07:44:16] <timmywil> matjas
[07:44:20] <timmywil> heh
[07:44:23] <timmywil> brb
[07:44:38] <gnarf> but i think whatever he was doing could basically check any commit
[07:48:20] <timmywil> back
[07:49:15] <gnarf> we could probably write a post-commit / deploy script that built / logged sizes of each commit
[07:49:47] <gnarf> it could even prolly add them as a github comment on the commit - but that might get noisy :)
[07:50:34] <rwaldron> jaubourg yt?
[07:50:50] <rwaldron> (he's gonna hate me for this)
[07:53:23] <timmywil> i think i see how these flags could be useful in 1.8 in the animate rewrite
[07:53:38] <timmywil> but i'll ask jaubourg for more details neway
[07:53:57] <DaveMethvin> i think it would be good to wait until a need is proven ... same with removeFail etc
[07:54:00] <gnarf> some of those flags are probably to support queue / event type callback buckets
[07:54:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah i can see how they can be used, but wonder if they are being used
[07:54:21] <gnarf> i think i missed some chat there... hrm
[07:54:37] <gnarf> i had (he's gonna hate me) then timmy talking about usefulness in 1.8
[07:54:41] <gnarf> someone fill me in in pm?
[07:55:05] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron always thinks ppl hate him :)
[07:55:17] <DaveMethvin> most of the time he's wrong ... MOST of the time
[07:55:25] <timmywil> gnarf: i'm not sure what rwaldron was gonna say
[07:55:37] <timmywil> i was referring to the flags concern
[07:55:39] <gnarf> ahhh
[07:55:43] <gnarf> okay, just topic jumped
[07:55:43] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i'm going to ask him to put empty lines before any comment blocks
[07:55:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah me too
[07:55:56] <rwaldron> $.Callbacks is great...
[07:55:59] <rwaldron> but hard to read
[07:56:03] <rwaldron> I get lost
[07:56:05] <gnarf> rwaldron - whitespace police
[07:56:16] <DaveMethvin> i would just like to see 1.7 get better, but smaller
[07:56:20] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, jzaefferer: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9398#comment:14
[07:56:47] <DaveMethvin> thanks timmywil
[07:56:48] <jzaefferer> timmywil: thanks
[07:57:54] <timmywil> np
[08:42:33] <matjas> http://mths.be/demo/jquery-size you spammers
[08:47:48] <gnarf> matjas: ++ :)
[08:54:51] <timmywil> still, i wouldn't mind having that in make
[08:55:19] <gnarf> matjas: whats the gzip cmmd?
[08:55:21] <timmywil> and not just per version
[08:55:44] * timmywil giggles at "per version"
[08:57:28] <JohnResig> hey all
[08:57:40] <rwaldron> hey JohnResig
[08:57:41] <timmywil> JohnResig: hi!
[08:58:56] <gnarf> hey timmy
[08:58:59] <gnarf> have you pushed sizzle?
[08:59:26] <gnarf> i can't seem to submodule update
[09:00:04] <timmywil> gnarf: on 1.7/combined?
[09:00:19] <gnarf> yeah
[09:00:42] <timmywil> go into sizzle and git checkout origin/1.7/sizzle -b 1.7/sizzle
[09:00:58] <rwaldron> meeting time?
[09:01:00] <timmywil> sizzle isn't on master either
[09:01:28] <timmywil> might have to git fetch first
[09:02:56] <timmywil> we tweeting?
[09:04:46] <DaveMethvin> izzit meeting time?
[09:04:49] <JohnResig> oh yeah, meeting
[09:14:23] <gnarf> timmywil: http://cl.ly/0d0T130h0M1g0r311p0d
[09:14:26] <gnarf> something like that?
[09:24:13] <timmywil> gnarf: that's cool, but I'm also hoping for a comparison since the last commit
[09:24:35] <gnarf> timmywil: hrm
[09:24:41] <gnarf> on commit?
[09:25:02] <timmywil> or since the last make
[09:25:17] <gnarf> last make might be easier
[09:31:58] <gnarf> hrm rwaldron / timmywil - i thought we fixed docs#10235 already
[09:31:59] <bot-t> [#10235] Timers deletion race condition causes animations to stop (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/10235
[09:33:14] <rwaldron> we may have?
[09:33:29] <rwaldron> i just assigned it to you because i saw "effects" and "animation"
[09:33:38] <rwaldron> and figured you could close it or whatever
[09:36:11] <gnarf> yeah, i think timmywil landed that, which is why i asked him :)
[09:36:53] <rwaldron> word!
[10:01:58] <matjas> gnarf: gzip -c foo.js > foo.js.gz (or just gzip foo.js if you donâ€™t need the original version anymore)
[10:03:24] <gnarf> yeah
[10:03:31] <gnarf> didn't know if you were gzip -c9
[10:03:32] <gnarf> or not
[10:04:08] <DaveMethvin> iis uses -c9 level, the default is -c6
[10:06:32] <gnarf> timmywil: check out that bug link about half hour ago if ya get a moment
[10:08:24] <matjas> -c6 is most common (default on apache + mod_deflate IIRC)
[10:08:34] <matjas> donâ€™t quote me on that
[10:42:05] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/80dd22a3a92082bb804f
[10:42:07] <gnarf> @timmywil
[10:46:28] <paul_irish> I'm speaking at jQuery UK btw ya'll
[10:50:32] <gnarf> timmywil: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/commit/a7a946577f70a43f46504d612251187b3a9d9b7c if you want to play with it
[10:54:25] <gnarf> jQuery Size - compared to last make
[10:54:25] <gnarf>   245858  (+7693) jquery.js
[10:54:25] <gnarf>    93302  (+1627) jquery.min.js
[10:54:26] <gnarf>    32883   (+805) jquery.min.js.gz
[10:54:28] <gnarf> jQuery build complete.
[10:54:30] <gnarf> this is master -> 1.7/combined:
[10:54:32] <gnarf> oops
[10:54:35] <gnarf> i meant to gist that
[10:54:36] <gnarf> sorry to flood
[11:13:42] <timmywil> paul_irish: if only i lived in the UK
[11:13:54] <timmywil> will i see you in boston?
[11:26:41] <rwaldron> gnarf aw snap
[11:26:44] <rwaldron> you beat me to it
[11:26:47] <rwaldron> nice one
[11:26:53] <rwaldron> you should use stats
[11:27:03] <rwaldron> npm install stats
[11:31:56] <gnarf> rwaldron: feel free to pick up my commit :)
[11:32:17] <gnarf> i was just bored
[11:32:25] <rwaldron> naw it's cool
[11:32:27] <rwaldron> roll with it
[11:32:38] <gnarf> i don't have npm on my primary dev machine
[11:32:39] <gnarf> :)
[11:35:13] <gnarf> hrm
[11:35:20] <gnarf> how many of those stats do we care about? :)
[11:37:37] <rwaldron> i dunno
[11:37:40] <rwaldron> one sec
[11:38:05] <rwaldron> gnarf http://gyazo.com/2e0205fedfbe58e305dd11971fbe9b28.png
[11:38:19] <rwaldron> this is the output from what i use in bocoup projects
[11:57:34] <gnarf> okay
[11:57:38] <gnarf> should we camel case before splitting
[11:57:43] <gnarf> or after in this data thing? :)
[11:58:09] <gnarf> like, should "test-a test-b" remove both data["test-a"] and data["testB"]
[11:58:10] <rwaldron> i dunno
[12:07:08] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: damn
[12:07:41] <DaveMethvin> okay let's think
[12:08:20] <DaveMethvin> "test-a test-b" first try the whole string, then if it doesn't match split(" ") and camel-case each in the loop
[12:08:37] <gnarf> or - don't waste time calling camelCase every time
[12:08:39] <DaveMethvin> oh but you have to try the whole string in the loop first before camelcase
[12:08:58] <gnarf> jQuery.camelCase( name ).split(" ")
[12:09:11] <DaveMethvin> then you would miss test-a
[12:09:15] <gnarf> true
[12:09:17] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:09:20] <timmywil> how would "test-a test-b" get stored?
[12:09:24] <DaveMethvin> damn this was supposed to be easy
[12:09:36] <timmywil> testA testB right?
[12:09:48] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: .data("imm-a nice guy", 42)
[12:10:04] <timmywil> would become immA nice guy yea?
[12:10:28] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we camel it on the way in ... or do we?
[12:10:31] <gnarf> we do
[12:10:34] <timmywil> i think we do
[12:10:40] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/fLgrm/
[12:10:49] <timmywil> so one call beforehand should do the trick
[12:10:55] <DaveMethvin> ok then precamelization should work
[12:11:11] <DaveMethvin> use the correct nomenclature, PLEEZE! :P
[12:11:22] <timmywil> hehe
[12:11:29] <gnarf> however if you .data()[ "test-a test-b" ] :)
[12:11:33] <gnarf> also
[12:11:40] <DaveMethvin> agreed but that was true before as well
[12:11:52] <gnarf> should it check the camel pre split once too?
[12:11:55] <DaveMethvin> if you go bareback it's your responsibility to do it right
[12:12:04] <timmywil> gnarf: yea
[12:12:14] * gnarf is trying to write tests
[12:12:15] <gnarf> lols
[12:12:19] <timmywil> first check "testA testB"
[12:12:26] <timmywil> then "testA", then "testB"
[12:12:41] <gnarf> "test-a test-b" then "testA testB" then "testA" and "testB"
[12:13:10] <timmywil> why the first?
[12:13:24] <DaveMethvin> if we camelized then you don't need to do the first, right?
[12:13:44] <gnarf> well in the standard path you check for hyphens first
[12:13:44] <DaveMethvin> unless someone did .data()[ whatever ] and we document that is wrong
[12:13:45] <gnarf> then camel
[12:14:16] <timmywil> i suppose you can, but like you said we camelCase before storing so it shouldn't be there
[12:14:42] <timmywil> unless like DaveMethvin says, a direct key is used
[12:15:41] <DaveMethvin> hmm, maybe that is a historical artifact then ... doesn't seem like we need to test the first if there is no way to get there other than direct access to .data()
[12:16:15] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/0C0Y0q3D0K0R0C063h2O
[12:16:15] <timmywil> well, maybe it saves a function call for the majority of use cases that don't have hyphens
[12:16:47] <gnarf> my brain i think wrapped around it
[12:16:57] <gnarf> although i don't like the isArray
[12:17:05] <gnarf> +1 function call :/
[12:17:22] <DaveMethvin> can we just use typeof there? it should be a gen-u-wine array
[12:17:30] <DaveMethvin> oh nevermind
[12:18:21] <gnarf> whats kinda cool is this actually cleans up some other code in events.js too :)
[12:18:39] <DaveMethvin> events?
[12:18:57] <gnarf> we can get rid of a "delete" keyword in the cleanup for remove event
[12:19:07] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i saw that
[12:19:09] <DaveMethvin> nice!
[12:19:13] <gnarf> just jQuery.removeData( elem, "events handle", true );
[12:19:35] <DaveMethvin> there was some ugly duplication there that your previous patch eliminated as well
[12:19:51] <gnarf> yeah
[12:20:08] <gnarf> where it was checking for the empty object
[12:20:11] <DaveMethvin> right
[12:20:20] <DaveMethvin> the pounds just melt away!
[12:22:32] <DaveMethvin> gnarf i wouldn't sweat the function call, can't imagine removeData is used that heavily
[12:22:44] <gnarf> yeah, i was thinking that myself ;)
[12:22:53] <DaveMethvin> ppl who need to use it  heavily should do jQuery.data() and chow down on the whole thing
[12:26:01] <timmywil> gnarf: you wanna set up a pull for your build utility?
[12:26:17] <gnarf> um, sure
[12:26:55] <timmywil> then I can use pulley to check it out
[12:27:00] <gnarf> http://jqbug.com/p511
[12:27:07] <gnarf> you cant pulley a commit?
[12:27:09] <gnarf> thats lame
[12:27:12] <gnarf> :)
[12:28:22] <rwaldron> i'm excited about this tool
[12:28:37] <gnarf> i never added rwaldron's stats yet
[12:28:46] <gnarf> but i think those 3 numbers are pretty solid to start with
[12:28:52] <gnarf> also random thing
[12:28:56] <timmywil> yea, we can always edit
[12:28:58] <gnarf> its possible to remove it from "core"
[12:29:04] <gnarf> and then just make size
[12:29:20] <gnarf> if you don't want it to run on every make
[12:29:29] <timmywil> cool
[12:29:53] <timmywil> if i run make twice in a row, will the second time always be zeros?
[12:30:09] <rwaldron> gnarf i will add later
[12:30:12] <gnarf> timmywil: yeah
[12:30:16] <rwaldron> as an optional thing
[12:30:31] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: awesome!
[12:31:02] <DaveMethvin> so do we have a fighting chance of 1.7 actually being the first version to be smaller than its predecessor?
[12:31:19] <gnarf> its +1.6k this time so far
[12:31:22] <gnarf> minified
[12:31:37] * DaveMethvin shakes fist  
[12:31:48] <gnarf> you could prolly have some fun bisecting it with my Makefile
[12:31:53] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[12:31:58] <gnarf> find the big shit
[12:32:05] <DaveMethvin> well prolly it's the html5 tag names and $.Callbacks
[12:32:11] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin so...
[12:32:20] <rwaldron> why dont you pull my fixedPosition in?
[12:32:27] <gnarf> damnit
[12:32:31] <rwaldron> that shit is like clear cutting in south america
[12:32:40] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:32:50] <rwaldron> for real though...
[12:32:55] <rwaldron> it removes a truck load of code
[12:32:58] <gnarf> theres a merge conflict between event.js 1.7/callbacks / internal-data-2
[12:33:01] <gnarf> er sry
[12:33:07] <gnarf> 1.7/combined
[12:34:16] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: only 805 bytes min.gz

[13:09:12] <rwaldron> timmywil guess how awesome that is...
[13:09:26] <rwaldron> the problem doesnt exist in my branch
[13:09:26] <timmywil> (                                                                  this awesome                                                                          )
[13:09:38] <rwaldron> so it is caused by something else
[13:09:51] <timmywil> hmm
[13:09:55] <rwaldron> i'm seeing the error, no doubt

[13:16:33] <timmywil> lemme see
[13:16:36] <gnarf> is it checking within an iframe?
[13:16:46] <rwaldron> i think so
[13:17:28] <rwaldron> wtf
[13:17:30] <timmywil> ah
[13:17:41] <timmywil> hehe, "ok = false"
[13:17:50] <timmywil> there goes the ok function!
[13:18:10] <rwaldron> weird
[13:18:16] <rwaldron> but I'm still failing that test
[13:18:47] <timmywil> yea me too, i don't think it actually got there
[13:18:56] <timmywil> but that's funny
[13:19:51] <rwaldron> well like.. i dont understand that test
[13:20:29] <rwaldron> I need to change which "body" i'm using
[13:20:31] <rwaldron> wtf

[13:23:00] <rwaldron> I WIN

[13:23:13] <timmywil> oh you got it?

[13:43:42] <timmywil> i haven't kept up with the discussion
[13:44:57] <rwaldron> oh awesome
[13:45:05] <rwaldron> but it will conflict with 6809
[13:45:11] <rwaldron> what else is new
[13:45:13] <rwaldron> merge it
[13:45:20] <rwaldron> fixedposition is fucked
[13:45:30] <rwaldron> i'm going to have to redo the whole fucking thing

[13:46:01] <rwaldron> everything
[13:46:12] <timmywil> ha, well. that narrows it down.
[13:46:12] <rwaldron> and nothing
[13:46:16] <rwaldron> i dontknow
[13:46:34] <rwaldron> i just now that when i was doing 6485, i test merged it with 6809 and it conflicts
[13:46:39] <rwaldron> i wanted to be prepared
[13:46:41] <rwaldron> just forget it
[13:46:47] <rwaldron> merge 6485

[14:04:24] <rwaldron> i think i got it
[14:04:28] <rwaldron> and reduced the code
[14:04:32] <rwaldron> i think it was always wrong
[14:04:33] <timmywil> sweeeet
[14:05:03] <rwaldron> If i push this, can you help me with testing?
[14:05:11] <timmywil> yarr
[14:05:18] <rwaldron> thanks
[14:05:24] <timmywil> (that's my pirate yes)
[14:07:26] <rwaldron> timmywil updated pull request
[14:07:32] <timmywil> kk
[14:07:33] <rwaldron> but i might have to merge it with master
[14:07:50] <rwaldron> kind of rushed out the door, so need help testing
[14:08:49] <rwaldron> so far so good though
[14:09:25] <timmywil> rwaldron: so what's wrong with using the testElement?
[14:09:44] <timmywil> just curious
[14:09:53] <rwaldron> the reason it was "true" in the iframe was because it was using the real document.body
[14:10:02] <rwaldron> it was always false before
[14:10:13] <rwaldron> it was wrong when i was using testElement
[14:10:24] <rwaldron> anyway, i'm still using elements wherever possible
[14:11:39] <timmywil> rwaldron: you are? it looks like you're only using body when it becomes available
[14:12:07] <timmywil> which might be a problem if it's a frameset that has no body
[14:12:34] <timmywil> wait, that was a different problem
[14:12:40] <timmywil> document.body vs document.get
[14:12:41] <rwaldron> timmywilam now
[14:12:42] <timmywil> nvm
[14:12:51] <rwaldron> yeah
[14:13:40] <timmywil> rwaldron: ok, but here's one thing https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/477/files#L1R298
[14:13:40] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (3w, 2h ago): 1.7 jQuery.offset.supportsFixedPosition. Ticket #6809
[14:13:52] <timmywil> passing in testElement and div, but they're not arguments
[14:13:55] <rwaldron> pfft
[14:13:56] <rwaldron> nice
[14:13:59] <rwaldron> thanks
[14:15:09] <rwaldron> i think, if i add || document.body
[14:15:16] <rwaldron> that it might be a little smarter
[14:15:23] <rwaldron> then relying one possible condition
[14:16:42] <rwaldron> timmywil updated
[14:17:09] <timmywil> forgive my slowness, but im still confused as to why testElement isn't being used
[14:17:47] <gnarf> hrm
[14:18:07] <rwaldron> that was the direct reason that supportsFixedPosition was false
[14:18:17] <rwaldron> wait, let me try one thing
[14:18:22] <timmywil> was it?
[14:18:23] <rwaldron> i just realized that...
[14:18:28] <timmywil> when I switched it to testElement
[14:18:31] <timmywil> it was true
[14:18:53] <rwaldron> it was already using testElement before
[14:19:01] <rwaldron> passed in as a param
[14:19:01] <timmywil> it was doing document.body || body
[14:19:06] <rwaldron> no
[14:19:14] <timmywil> yes it was
[14:19:17] <rwaldron> testElement was passed as a formal param
[14:19:21] <rwaldron> and named "body"
[14:19:25] <timmywil> yes, i know
[14:19:32] <timmywil> but document.body was given precedence
[14:19:37] <timmywil> if I took that line out
[14:19:41] <timmywil> testElement was always used
[14:19:42] <timmywil> and it passed
[14:19:45] <rwaldron> right, but when i removed that line
[14:19:50] <rwaldron> it was still broken
[14:20:04] <rwaldron> one sec
[14:20:05] <timmywil> still false?
[14:20:08] <gnarf> i wonder if there isn't an abstraction layer here for $.bodyTest( fn )
[14:20:09] <rwaldron> yes
[14:20:09] <timmywil> hrm
[14:20:14] <rwaldron> let me triple check
[14:20:23] <timmywil> i was sure it turned true for me
[14:20:25] <gnarf> we use this a few times in ui as well
[14:21:23] <rwaldron> hot shit
[14:21:25] <rwaldron> you were right
[14:21:34] <rwaldron> I missed it somehow
[14:21:38] <rwaldron> thanks for pressing the issue

[18:19:19] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by dmethvin (1w, 5d ago): Fix #7322. Make `.is()` with a positional selector work like delegated event logic
[18:19:23] <timmywil> there we go
[18:19:33] <DaveMethvin> so what do you think about that?
[18:20:02] <timmywil> seems strange that we need a POS test when there's one in winnow
[18:20:19] <timmywil> but i'm not sure i understand the problem
[18:20:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah and i totally DO NOT understand some of those test case results
[18:20:35] <DaveMethvin> they don't make any sense to me
[18:20:41] <DaveMethvin> the ones in my fiddle that is
[18:21:07] <timmywil> looking now
[18:21:16] <DaveMethvin> jQuery( Â #firstaÂ  ).is( Â #firstp span:firstÂ  ) = Â trueÂ 
[18:21:24] <DaveMethvin> i don't see how that could be true
[18:21:51] <timmywil> i do understand this one tho jQuery(  #seconda  ).is(  #firstp a:first  ) =  true
[18:22:01] <timmywil> #seconda is first in the selection
[18:22:08] <timmywil> not first in relation to other a tags
[18:22:23] <timmywil> as that would be :first-child
[18:22:27] <timmywil> but yea
[18:22:29] <timmywil> the span one
[18:22:31] <timmywil> wat
[18:24:25] <DaveMethvin> well the pull fixes it  but since you are the resident sizzler ... :)
[18:24:31] <timmywil> hmmmmmm
[18:24:46] <DaveMethvin> i wondered if it belonged in matchesSelector instead
[18:24:53] <timmywil> the POS I was thinking of is in closest
[18:25:06] <timmywil> i did .is and .closest edits roughly at the same time
[18:25:22] <DaveMethvin> it definitely feels dirty for me to be looking at POS deep inside event.js
[18:25:31] <timmywil> for sure
[18:26:05] <timmywil> the problem I foresee is that if .is() has a problem, .filter() probably has the same problem and it should be handled in winnow
[18:26:25] <DaveMethvin> hmmmm
[18:26:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's been a while since i actually looked at the problem and i do recall being very confused by it
[18:27:06] <timmywil> what does .filter('#firsta').filter('#firstp span:first') give us?
[18:27:13] <timmywil> woops
[18:27:18] <timmywil> just the second filter
[18:27:30] <timmywil> im typing sporatically
[18:28:34] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yup, check it out http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/eJ4yd/5/
[18:28:59] <DaveMethvin> why?
[18:29:10] <timmywil> .is() just calls .filter() and checks length
[18:29:19] <timmywil> .filter shouldn't be returning anything
[18:29:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was wondering why filter was borked too :)
[18:29:32] <DaveMethvin> but yeah good eye
[18:29:44] <timmywil> lemme follow the stack
[18:29:44] <DaveMethvin> so winnow is at fault
[18:29:49] <DaveMethvin> most likely
[18:32:43] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: looks like a sizzle issue
[18:32:56] <DaveMethvin> i am shocked! :P
[18:38:11] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ah
[18:38:17] <timmywil> well, hmm
[18:38:38] <DaveMethvin> uh oh, this is an ah AND a hmm?
[18:38:44] <timmywil> because it is being filter by a descendent selector, the set that Sizzle filters becomes the children of the parent
[18:38:51] <timmywil> filtered*
[18:38:56] <timmywil> make sense?
[18:39:21] <timmywil> so first it gets #firstp
[18:40:04] <timmywil> then it gets any spans in #firstp
[18:40:37] <DaveMethvin> oh i see...
[18:40:57] <timmywil> instead of filtering against #firsta, it's filtering spans
[18:41:41] <timmywil> this may be hard to fix
[18:44:59] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil, why is  jQuery( Â #firstaÂ  ).is( Â #firstp spanÂ  ) = Â falseÂ 
[18:45:20] <timmywil> wait, huh?
[18:45:26] <DaveMethvin> given your description it should return the span
[18:45:28] <timmywil> you said it was true
[18:45:43] <DaveMethvin> no, jQuery( Â #firstaÂ  ).is( Â #firstp span:firstÂ  ) = Â falseÂ 
[18:45:49] <DaveMethvin> sorry true
[18:45:54] <DaveMethvin> only breaks on the :first
[18:46:01] <timmywil> yea, it's just when :first is added
[18:46:19] <timmywil> when I say filter I mean sizzle filter, as in :first
[18:46:26] <DaveMethvin> oh
[18:46:30] <timmywil> sry bout that
[18:46:46] <DaveMethvin> whaddya think i am, some kinda sizzle expert? :)
[18:47:09] <timmywil> YES
[18:47:21] <timmywil> plz
[18:47:23] <DaveMethvin> this must have been a "known bug" for a while, whoever wrote the live() code worked aroud it
[18:47:34] <DaveMethvin> so i was just propagating that workaround
[18:47:46] <DaveMethvin> which was easier than figuring out sizzle :/
[18:48:21] <timmywil> how much is dependent on the position selector for .is() working in events
[18:48:31] <timmywil> i mean, I'm going to try to fix it
[18:48:52] <DaveMethvin> i don't need it for 1.7, i have the workaround in there already
[18:49:04] <DaveMethvin> this was just pushing it to .is()
[18:49:04] <timmywil> kk
[18:49:24] <timmywil> what was your workaround? avoiding calling filter with POS selectors?
[18:49:46] <DaveMethvin> basically i do what's in that pull ... if it's a POS selector, get the set and see if my element is there
[18:50:04] <timmywil> i see
[18:50:28] <timmywil> well, that should be what sizzle does.  i'll look into it further
[18:50:40] <DaveMethvin> sounds like we don't need that patch for jQuery but you might want the unit tests
[18:51:12] <timmywil> yea, those will definitely be helpful
[19:01:06] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i think I was off a little
[19:01:08] <timmywil> surprise!
[19:01:32] <timmywil> Sizzle follows a unique codepath for POS selectors
[19:01:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's a BIG surprise /sarcasm
[19:02:20] <timmywil> it SEEMS that this code path does not include any filtering
[19:02:32] <timmywil> and i mean jQuery filtering this time
[19:03:56] <DaveMethvin> i remember john mumbling something about positional selectors when reviewing some tickets during our bugfest day in boston ... but i thought it was just the ravings of a madman
[19:03:58] <timmywil> jQuery.filter is basically a wrapper around Sizzle.matchesSelector, which in this case (since :first is not a support QSA selector), is really a special call to Sizzle with a certain argument called seed (which is the anchor tag to filter this span against)
[19:04:18] <timmywil> that argument
[19:04:19] <timmywil> seed
[19:04:21] <timmywil> is never
[19:04:27] <timmywil> used in this codepath
[19:04:33] <DaveMethvin> i remember getting that far ... [node] :)
[19:04:39] <timmywil> yup!
[19:04:43] <timmywil> [node] is seed
[19:04:45] <DaveMethvin> well that would be a bug, eh?
[19:04:48] <timmywil> oh ya
[19:04:59] <timmywil> JohnResig
[19:05:19] <timmywil> i could use your expertise if you're around
[19:13:19] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: woo!
[19:13:24] <timmywil> think i have a fix
[19:13:29] <DaveMethvin> that was quick
[19:13:56] <timmywil> the codepath does call Sizzle again later on.
[19:14:03] <timmywil> if i keep passing seed through, it works
[19:14:39] <DaveMethvin> that sounds easy
[19:14:41] <DaveMethvin> TOO easy :P
[19:14:53] <timmywil> much too easy, but I'm adding your tests now
[19:15:09] <timmywil> i just had it hooked up to the fiddle
[19:15:59] <timmywil> i think I'm starting to form a path through this maze
[19:16:52] <DaveMethvin> sizzle has you right where it wants  you, timmy
[19:17:05] <DaveMethvin> sense of false security
[19:17:29] <timmywil> all i can do now is let it
[19:24:50] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: your tests are a little off tho
[19:24:58] <DaveMethvin> uh oh
[19:25:26] <DaveMethvin> you mean like wrong results?
[19:25:52] <DaveMethvin> they prolly should have some more complex and varied cases
[19:26:19] <timmywil> i think you're confusing :first with :first-child and the like
[19:26:44] <DaveMethvin> ugh, i hope not
[19:26:45] <timmywil> even though an anchor is the second anchor positionally, it is still :first in the selection so it's true
[19:27:06] <timmywil> because :first is just a matter of where it is in the jQuery object
[19:27:13] <timmywil> is it index === 0
[19:27:16] <timmywil> that's it
[19:27:21] <DaveMethvin> right
[19:27:41] <timmywil> that goes for :last
[19:27:54] <timmywil> if the selection is only 1 element, :last will be true too
[19:28:25] <DaveMethvin> pick one that's wrong, lemme look
[19:28:39] <timmywil> isit( "#posp .firsta", "#posp a:last", true );
[19:28:59] <timmywil> oops
[19:29:05] <timmywil> i changed it from false
[19:29:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah that looks riht to me
[19:29:14] <timmywil> it was false
[19:29:41] <timmywil> your test had false, which should fail.
[19:29:44] <timmywil> is what i mean
[19:30:11] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, now should it?
[19:30:23] <DaveMethvin> see this is where comparing the elements comes in
[19:30:37] <timmywil> that would be :last-child
[19:31:00] <timmywil> because $('#posp .first') only selects one thing, :last will always be true
[19:31:11] <timmywil> :last-child will not
[19:32:25] <DaveMethvin> that seems counterintuitive tho ... #posp .firsta is a particular element, #posp a:last is not that element
[19:32:36] <timmywil> sure it is
[19:32:43] <timmywil> http://gyazo.com/aee0fa1d12fde0c3d3106e7175a7367d
[19:33:49] <timmywil> $('#posp a:last') and $('#posp a:last-child') will often select the same thing, but they are very different
[19:34:04] <DaveMethvin> #posp .firsta is <a class=firsta>  but #posp a:last is <a class=seconda>
[19:34:08] <DaveMethvin> right?
[19:35:35] <timmywil> this is a filter tho
[19:35:41] <timmywil> not a selection
[19:35:56] <DaveMethvin> OH, i see what you mean
[19:36:04] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking in terms of identity
[19:36:13] <DaveMethvin> which is also what we need to know in the event code
[19:36:40] <DaveMethvin> the word "is" implies identity but since it's implemented in terms of filter that isn't necessarily true
[19:36:53] <DaveMethvin> and deja vu i've been here before
[19:37:14] <timmywil> and now we come full circle and i understand why you thought this was just a problem with .is()
[19:37:19] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:37:25] <DaveMethvin> good night everyone!
[19:37:28] <timmywil> lol
[19:37:44] <timmywil> ugh, well i DID fix a sizzle bug
[19:37:48] <timmywil> so there
[19:37:49] <DaveMethvin> well matchesSelector WAS broken yeah
[19:38:06] <DaveMethvin> i'll have to add a comment so i don't end up here a third time
[19:38:15] <timmywil> ok, i think we should merge your patch then
[19:38:27] <DaveMethvin> do you think it makes sense?
[19:38:32] <timmywil> after you add a comment explaining why POS is special
[19:38:35] <timmywil> totally
[19:39:03] <DaveMethvin> ok lemme update the pull ... i just need to clean up an ie patch first
[19:39:07] <timmywil> we can't be filtering existing selections instead of creating new ones to confirm identity
[19:39:34] <timmywil> when the selector is in relation to the elements next to it
[19:40:08] <timmywil> :first-child and :last-child still worked fine, but any that depended on the jQuery object containing certain elements were broken
[19:40:23] <timmywil> anyway, just thinking out loud
[19:44:40] <DaveMethvin> good to think out loud timmywil ... so i wonder, should we really be checking for set membership in all cases?
[19:45:01] <timmywil> i think it makes sense if filtering
[19:45:17] <timmywil> filter should never create a new selection
[19:46:45] <DaveMethvin> $(elem).is("ul")  vs $(elem).is("ul:first")
[19:47:29] <DaveMethvin> i mean, the native matchesSelector is prolly smart and just looks at nodeName for the first case anyway
[19:48:09] <DaveMethvin> the second case gets hairy b/c i'm askign for the first one and the fact that it's the first one clearly seems to be important to me
[19:48:23] <timmywil> agreed, but your patch will fix that
[19:48:28] <DaveMethvin> right
[19:48:48] <timmywil> although
[19:49:00] <timmywil> $(disconnectedElem).is('ul:first')
[19:49:13] <DaveMethvin> damn you
[19:49:14] <timmywil> always false?
[19:49:18] <timmywil> hehe
[19:49:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'd say so
[19:49:30] <DaveMethvin> i guess i'd say so
[19:49:37] <DaveMethvin> i just HATE positional selectors
[19:50:03] <DaveMethvin> in the case of events we never ask such a stooooopid question
[19:50:09] <timmywil> lol
[19:50:35] <timmywil> no we ask SMART questions
[19:52:11] <timmywil> yea, always false sounds right
[19:52:40] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: on master i'm getting a missing semicolon in jslint, looks like it's in support.js
[19:52:58] <timmywil> but eeeeek $(disconnectedelem).is(':first')
[19:53:11] <timmywil> me too, already added it
[19:53:18] <DaveMethvin> k just wanted to be sure
[19:53:39] <timmywil> ?tell rwaldron more semicolons
[19:53:39] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[19:53:58] <DaveMethvin> good lord what is the right answer there?
[19:54:34] <timmywil> the old way would always return true, the new way will always return false
[19:54:42] <DaveMethvin> if .is() is implicitly searching the document then the answer is false
[19:54:48] <DaveMethvin> the CORRECT answer
[19:54:53] <timmywil> yes
[19:54:57] <DaveMethvin> for some definitions of CORRECT
[19:55:04] <timmywil> hehe yes
[19:55:17] <DaveMethvin> ok
[19:55:19] <timmywil> for the filtering mindset like my old one, it would be true
[19:55:28] <timmywil> but I've been told I'm too low-level
[19:55:46] <DaveMethvin> i totally understand the .filter().length look on things
[19:55:52] <timmywil> and kinda nerdy
[19:56:01] <DaveMethvin> it's just that when you start witht he positional filters it gets really wonky
[19:56:07] <timmywil> and pretentious
[19:56:15] <DaveMethvin> but curiously interesting
[19:56:32] <timmywil> and now getting a little loopy
[19:56:34] <DaveMethvin> ok lemme get this comment done
[19:56:39] <DaveMethvin> damn 11pm

[20:18:55] <timmywil> you pulled jquery?
[20:19:11] <gnarf> yeah
[20:19:11] <timmywil> oh! sizzle can go back on master
[20:19:13] <DaveMethvin> ut oh me too
[20:19:42] <gnarf> just seems sizzle git repo is missing your commit
[20:19:46] <gnarf> that its refing
[20:19:58] <gnarf> i can't make to see what kinda shavings
[20:19:59] <gnarf> :)
[20:20:09] <timmywil> cd src/sizzle
[20:20:15] <timmywil> which branch are you on?
[20:20:21] <gnarf> detached head
[20:20:26] <timmywil> if you mistakenly listened to me earlier
[20:20:27] <timmywil> oh
[20:20:28] <gnarf> like anyone who doesn't mess with master
[20:20:30] <gnarf> :)
[20:20:37] <timmywil> hmmmmm
[20:20:45] <timmywil> make pull_submodules
[20:20:50] <timmywil> maybe
[20:21:03] <gnarf> it just runs git submodule update
[20:21:07] <gnarf> which is failing
[20:21:13] <gnarf> cuz it can't ref the sizzle commit
[20:21:33] <timmywil> ha
[20:21:38] <timmywil> woooops
[20:21:41] <timmywil> my bad guys
[20:21:54] <sizcommit> [sizzle] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vYgbAQ
[20:21:54] <sizcommit> [sizzle/master] Pass through seed argument for filtering seeded positional selections. - timmywil
[20:22:18] <timmywil> i pushed to origin
[20:22:30] <gnarf> im still getting a missing semicolon
[20:22:36] * gnarf shrugs and moves on
[20:22:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah me too
[20:22:56] <DaveMethvin> at least sizzle is happy now
[20:23:09] <gnarf>    93880    (-35) jquery.min.js
[20:23:09] <gnarf>    33217     (-7) jquery.min.js.gz
[20:23:09] <gnarf> woot :)
[20:23:26] <DaveMethvin> wait until i land this ie stuff i'm working on
[20:23:32] <DaveMethvin> LOTS fewer butes
[20:23:33] <DaveMethvin> bytes
[20:23:42] <timmywil> yay!
[20:24:30] <DaveMethvin> that includes all the stuff jaubourg added too, so i think we're doing pretty well
[20:24:55] <gnarf> i'll prolly eat up those 35 i shaved adding hooks
[20:24:56] <gnarf> :)
[20:25:19] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/TaB7TQ
[20:25:19] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] semicolon for jshint happiness - timmywil
[20:25:47] <DaveMethvin> and there was great rejoicing
[20:25:54] <timmywil> best. commit. ever.
[20:26:08] <DaveMethvin> wait, we need a code review for that
[20:26:11] <timmywil> make +1 byte
[20:27:25] <timmywil> gnarf: how hard would it be to add size difference since last commit?  Would we have to commit the build folder?
[20:27:48] <gnarf> timmywil: umm...
[20:27:58] <gnarf> prolly not hard if i can figure out how to tie it into git status
[20:28:10] <gnarf> but really
[20:28:29] <gnarf> git stash ; make ; git stash pop; make
[20:28:45] <timmywil> ah good point
[20:28:46] <gnarf> or just git checkout sha ; make ; git checkout branch ; make
[20:29:11] <timmywil> yea ok
[20:30:08] <timmywil> hey gnarf: i fixed my first semi-major sizzle bug tonight
[20:30:16] <gnarf> nice
[20:30:22] <timmywil> praise and rejoicing
[20:30:24] <gnarf> i started working on my slides
[20:30:38] <timmywil> how many you got?
[20:30:42] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/3C042b2z012f0e0h2t0z
[20:31:07] <DaveMethvin> you guys have such pro slides
[20:31:15] <DaveMethvin> wait till you see my prezo
[20:31:17] <gnarf> thats just a deck.js template
[20:31:30] <DaveMethvin> mine is all lolcats all the time
[20:31:33] <timmywil> I just forked the html5 preso
[20:31:44] <timmywil> ha
[20:31:45] <DaveMethvin> ok so pulley hates me
[20:31:47] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/special-fx
[20:32:00] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: is your origin wired to jquery?
[20:32:17] <timmywil> you're trying to use my upstream one?
[20:32:25] <DaveMethvin> let me double check, it was the one i got from you and i editted it
[20:34:31] <timmywil> i did npm install pulley, went to /usr/local/lib/node_modules/pulley and replaced pulley.js and config.js
[20:34:56] <DaveMethvin> it's saying i have changes staged for commit, but t hey're in test/qunit ?
[20:35:04] <DaveMethvin> nothing to commit to master
[20:35:20] <DaveMethvin> so i can't stash them
[20:35:47] <timmywil> if you can't stash, it won't be added to the commit
[20:36:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah but pulley refuses to run if anything needs to be committed
[20:36:27] <DaveMethvin> even in a submodule like qunit
[20:36:33] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you ran git pull_submodules?
[20:36:37] <timmywil> i mean make
[20:36:43] <timmywil> make pull_submodules
[20:36:50] <DaveMethvin> doing it now
[20:37:02] <DaveMethvin> says it's all  up to date
[20:37:05] <timmywil> that would pull in the latest qunit, which you would then need to commit
[20:37:18] <timmywil> yea, you already pulled in qunit changes apparently
[20:37:33] <timmywil> you can commit that and just say "Update QUnit"
[20:39:10] <gnarf> ooo
[20:39:17] <gnarf> this slide looks nice with textmate cobalt theme
[20:39:18] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/141b0k2d320T1r2A0j3N
[20:39:42] <timmywil> sure does
[20:39:43] <DaveMethvin> ok well pulley crashed
[20:39:59] <DaveMethvin> i've seen this before...
[20:40:02] <timmywil> you haven't committed QUnit yet
[20:40:20] <DaveMethvin> oh i did to MY origin
[20:40:37] <DaveMethvin> pushed that is
[20:40:49] <timmywil> yea, that may be a problem for pulley
[20:41:05] <timmywil> push to upstream, we'll just make to update
[20:41:26] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/bSv6FA
[20:41:26] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Update qunit. - Dave Methvin
[20:42:05] <timmywil> perfect, that fix it?
[20:42:14] <DaveMethvin> nope
[20:42:25] <timmywil> what's the message
[20:42:33] <DaveMethvin> node.js:134
[20:42:33] <DaveMethvin>         throw e; // process.nextTick error, or 'error' event on first tick
[20:42:33] <DaveMethvin>         ^
[20:42:33] <DaveMethvin> TypeError: Cannot call method 'emit' of undefined
[20:43:25] <timmywil> hmm, emit?
[20:43:37] <timmywil> is that a typo?
[20:44:09] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: did you get "initializingâ€¦"?
[20:44:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it got to pulling and merging, then this stack trace:
[20:44:28] <DaveMethvin> TypeError: Cannot call method 'emit' of undefined

[20:45:11] <gnarf> hrm
[20:45:43] <gnarf> would anyone mind if I renamed the queue 'type' param to queueName ?
[20:46:18] <timmywil> suppose not
[20:46:43] <DaveMethvin> hey it's compressed to one char either way
[20:46:46] <gnarf> yeah
[20:47:02] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: did it create a branch for the pull?
[20:47:05] <gnarf> its just kinda not a "queue type" its the name...
[20:47:07] <timmywil> pull-###
[20:47:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah timmywil
[20:47:09] <gnarf> maybe even just "name"
[20:47:21] <gnarf> name makes more sense
[20:47:30] <DaveMethvin> i cleaned it out to see if that was choking it
[20:47:57] <DaveMethvin> actualy it left me on that branch, lemme see what it did
[20:48:10] <timmywil> oh it left you there?
[20:48:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[20:48:27] <DaveMethvin> left me on pull-491
[20:48:35] <DaveMethvin> didn't change any files
[20:48:58] <DaveMethvin> this seems somehow familar
[20:49:16] <DaveMethvin> i gotta go now tho, i'll figure it out tomorrow
[20:49:23] <DaveMethvin> can you land pull 491?
[20:49:27] <timmywil> sure
[20:49:53] <DaveMethvin> thanks! i'll either figure out pulley or do it manually
[20:50:19] <DaveMethvin> when it works it's great, when it fails it's incomprehensible
[20:50:44] <timmywil> and hard to help debug from irc
[20:51:03] <DaveMethvin> prolly something stupid but it's hard to tell
[20:51:25] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/t6yhYA
[20:51:25] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Landing pull request 491. Fix #7322. Make `.is()` with a positional selector work like delegated event logic. Fixes #7322. - Dave Methvin
[20:51:53] <DaveMethvin> see  you guys tomorrow!
[20:52:00] <timmywil> seeya dave!
[21:25:04] <gnarf> welp - done with the first rev of .queue() slides
[21:25:06] <gnarf> :)
