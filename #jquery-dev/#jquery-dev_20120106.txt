[04:35:42] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[04:43:31] <gf3> DEPRECATE ALL CUSTOM SELECTORS
[04:43:33] <gf3> +1

[04:59:19] <gf3> jzaefferer: bahaha amazing, it's like you're in my mind
[04:59:57] <jzaefferer> or like I read your message and dumped that into iMeme ;)
[05:00:35] <gf3> one of the two
[05:05:02] <Clooth> Help me think of a name for a Web Development / IT company I am starting. :) Short, catchy, relevant, modern, memorable, easy to pronounce, must be in english.
[05:11:10] <gf3> Clooth: call it jQuery
[05:11:14] <Clooth> yeh
[05:34:51] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Thoughts on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7991 ?
[05:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> Firefox throws an error if you try to access the input property of the event
[05:37:13] <DaveMethvin> hmm i wonder why?

[05:45:08] <scott_gonzalez> It's apparently not implemented, not sure why they don't just leave it out instead of throwing an error
[05:46:02] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: yeah, it seems pretty stupid to implement a property only to say "nope, not here"
[05:46:18] <scott_gonzalez> The error comes from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.widget.js#L394
[05:47:04] <DaveMethvin> i set a breakpoint in that area and it didn't seem to fire though
[05:47:29] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I was able to see it firing and dying there
[05:47:35] <DaveMethvin> i get a trigger on "create" but nothing before that
[05:47:57] <DaveMethvin> the errors appear, in the output before i get the breakpoint
[05:47:58] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it'll be after that
[05:48:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you should also change the name of the widget from the fiddle
[05:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> test.trigger is a horrible name
[05:48:37] <scott_gonzalez> since it overwrites $.fn.trigger
[05:49:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and now no error?
[05:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> did you change it in both places?
[05:49:31] <scott_gonzalez> The definition of the widget and the call to the widget?
[05:49:52] <DaveMethvin> well now i did, and yeah error
[05:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[05:50:24] <DaveMethvin> but again i never get a _trigger for "progress"
[05:50:26] <scott_gonzalez> I really don't want to have to wrap each property set in a try/catch
[05:50:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[05:50:48] <DaveMethvin> i have a breakpoint set on data = data || {}
[05:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> Skype for screenshare?
[05:51:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah lemme start it
[07:15:42] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[07:16:04] <rwaldron> that one/mouseenter issue also applies to mouseleave: http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/fS6fV/
[07:45:26] <andrew_sayers> I've tried to submit a bug report in Trac, but it gets rejected as spam.  I would report a bug in the bug tracker, but the infinite loop might make my head might explode... is it OK to describe the bug here instead?
[07:53:57] <andrew_sayers> Ok ok, don't ask if you can ask :)
[07:54:12] <andrew_sayers> I would like to do $(selector).load( ... ), and have the loaded document automatically fire JS that interacts with the <script> it's called from, e.g.: <script class="foo">$(".foo").after(stuff_built_dynamically_in_the_page)</script>
[07:54:48] <andrew_sayers> This doesn't work right now, because $.clean() deletes the <script> tag while pulling it out to execute it.
[07:54:59] <andrew_sayers> So the bug is that, while building the DocumentFragment, $.clean() should insert the <script> tag as well as making a note to implement it.
[07:56:10] <andrew_sayers> I would be happy to work on this if it's any help.
