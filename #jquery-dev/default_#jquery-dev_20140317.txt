[05:49:51] <JamesMGreene> Any Textual users out there?  Curious why this thing costs $5... seems pretty darn basic
[05:51:33] <JamesMGreene> Maybe it's all the underlying stuff (SSL, certificates, deep ZNC, etc.)
[06:11:27] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: let me know your experiences from Textual, looks fine at first sight :)
[06:12:10] <m_gol> I tried Colloquy but it allows me to send messages when I get disconnected from the internet which is enough to make it unusable for me
[06:31:11] <JamesMGreene> Good criteria, m_gol. Let me try that with Textual from now
[06:40:41] <JamesMGreene> m_gol: Some notes on Textual: (1) can still send messages while offline :-\   (2) doesn't reconnect on disconnect by default but can be turned on (and works, though had a surprisingly long delay (~30 seconds?) before the reconnect happens)
[06:46:44] <JamesMGreene> m_gol: You can, however, set up special alerts for when the disconnection happens (sounds, popups, etc.), so perhaps that would meet your needs...?  Still annoying that you can send messages while offline without getting a warning alert
[07:45:04] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: meh, that's bad :/
[07:45:21] <m_gol> Linkinus does this one thing right but it's no longer developed and has other annoying issues...
[07:57:25] <ajpiano> i gave up on linkinus recently after like 4 years, for textual
[07:57:47] <ajpiano> textual plays back ZNC logs in like a second and doesn't leak memory like a sieve
[07:58:27] <m_gol> ajpiano: yeah, that's my issue as well - restart takes, like, half a minute because it's printing those logs from ZNC extremely slowly
[07:58:34] <m_gol> gnarf: ping
[07:59:26] <ajpiano> m_gol i got into the habit of just closing linkinus while it plays back the znc logs
[08:00:16] <ajpiano> it loads everything in faster than if you actually wait for it to stream 'em all in 
[08:00:29] <ajpiano> m_gol also disable rich text logging if you haven't already
[08:05:08] <m_gol> ajpiano: how can it load logs if you close it?
[08:05:26] <ajpiano> m_gol cause the agent works in the background

[09:41:37] <JamesMGreene> Wow, Textual's trial is pretty brutal to trial users :)
[09:41:51] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: you mean? ;)
[09:41:51] <JamesMGreene> Auto-disconnects after 2 hours (and won't honor the auto-reconnect)
[09:41:56] <m_gol> haha
[09:41:57] <JamesMGreene> "[10:39:41] Disconnected from server due to trial period limit. Please consider purchasing Textual to continue or simply reconnect."
[09:42:02] <JamesMGreene> :-P
[09:42:40] <JamesMGreene> I'm used to mIRC on Windows that just gives you an annoying popup that you have to wait to click through when you first open it (when you're beyond the trial period)
[09:49:59] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: did the ranting guy say anything interesting about oldIE? ;)
[09:52:34] <gibson042> timmywil did you check the Sizzle pull against IE8?
[09:55:39] <timmywil> gibson042: works for me
[09:55:44] <gibson042> cool

[10:37:08] <gnarf> m_gol: travelling internationally today
[10:38:53] <markelog> Krinkle|detached: ping
[11:06:20] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: still here?
[11:06:31] <DaveMethvin> kinda, multitasking meetings :)
[11:06:35] <m_gol> ;)
[11:06:37] <DaveMethvin> looks like you fixed the tests?
[11:06:43] <DaveMethvin> you and Krinkle
[11:06:51] <m_gol> seems Android jobs on TestSwarm aren't executing nearly as long as locally
[11:06:53] <m_gol> yup
[11:07:05] <m_gol> the last run that actually run finished after ~15 mintues
[11:07:09] <DaveMethvin> that's good
[11:07:47] <m_gol> another one took 27 min
[11:08:08] <m_gol> but since one Android takes about 30 min when running the whole suite, it's definitely not bad
[11:08:25] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if they run "headless" somehow in those cases
[11:08:32] <DaveMethvin> so it's not having to waste time painting
[11:08:42] <m_gol> one thing is that we divide by modules
[11:08:49] <m_gol> and execute a lot simultaneously
[11:08:57] <DaveMethvin> right, maybe it's memory
[11:08:58] <m_gol> so maybe our BrowserStack account is handling it well enough
[11:09:24] <DaveMethvin> i noticed something similar with old ie if you run a full test
[11:09:28] <DaveMethvin> sizzle takes a long time
[11:09:32] <DaveMethvin> but if you run it separately not so bad
[11:09:39] <m_gol> haha
[11:10:02] <m_gol> we might even revisit running Androids in the main run, dunno
[11:10:21] <m_gol> but then it'd probably take ~30-35 mins instead of 10-15 so maybe it's not worth it
[11:10:41] <m_gol> still, way better than 4 hours that I expected ;)
[11:10:52] <DaveMethvin> Android 2.3 is like a crazy uncle, best to keep him in the attic
[11:11:01] <m_gol> (I expected ~2.5h, I set the timeout to 4h)
[11:11:19] <DaveMethvin> four hours! 
[11:11:42] <m_gol> I was thinking about 4.x, but yeah, it would double our test time certainly
[11:11:55] <m_gol> 2.x jobs sometimes finish after 5 minutes :-)
[11:11:59] <m_gol> not always, but it happens
[11:12:34] <m_gol> but we might consider running them twice a week during the night since it's only ~30 minutes
[11:13:11] <DaveMethvin> that would be good with me, even more often if it doesn't bother anyone else and use up their workers
[11:13:48] <m_gol> I shouldn't have named them "weekly" :P
[11:14:00] <m_gol> it doesn't matter a lot, though ;)
[11:14:02] <DaveMethvin> weakly
[11:14:18] <m_gol> :D
[11:14:24] <m_gol> IE7 passed effects again: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2696
[11:14:39] <JamesMGreene> \o/
[11:14:39] <m_gol> this one certainly just didn't like Chrome & Firefox companions
[11:19:11] <m_gol> haha, IE6 will finish after Android 2.3
