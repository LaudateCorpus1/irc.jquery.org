[13:33:06] <JamesMGreene> Heeeeey, ajpiano
[13:33:30] <JamesMGreene> Do we know which date the team mtg will be in San Diego?  I assume either the 11th or (gasp) Valentine's Day
[13:33:49] <JamesMGreene> Might be wise to avoid the latter
[13:33:49] <ajpiano> it won't be valentine's
[13:33:51] <ajpiano> yes
[13:33:55] <JamesMGreene> \o/

[13:34:05] <JamesMGreene> word
[13:34:12] <JamesMGreene> OK, so probably the 11th then
[13:34:19] <ajpiano> prob
[13:34:38] <JamesMGreene> kthx, good enough for now
