[06:39:03] <timmywil> hi
[06:46:26] <gibson042> .
[08:32:24] <gnarf> kswedberg: you lurking #jquery?  There is a docish conversation hapening there, let me get you a transcript
[08:33:00] <kswedberg> hey gnarf. thx.
[08:33:13] <kswedberg> just joined the #jquery channel
[08:37:04] <gnarf> kswedberg: https://gist.github.com/0f9f6ceaf50e1a26f487
[08:37:38] <gnarf> thats the back scroll
[09:02:04] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin you blitzed me!
[09:02:07] <rwaldron> "Evidently, IE won't recognize the invalid "put" method. When i changed it to "get" it worked fine."
[09:02:18] <DaveMethvin> haha
[09:02:37] <DaveMethvin> i always like to quote the spec
[09:03:38] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron you recruited sindresorhus, who the heck is he? should I add him to jquery-bugs?
[09:07:15] <kswedberg> gnarf: I updated http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.hasData/
[09:07:19] <kswedberg> thx for the heads up
[09:21:10] <gnarf> kswedberg: one more caveat potentially - private data will cause hasData to be true
[09:21:28] <gnarf> (i.e. events)
[09:21:41] <gnarf> so .data() could be an empty object, and .hasData() still turns true
[09:22:55] <kswedberg> gnarf: ok, so maybe I shouldn't be so specific as to just say "events"
[09:23:10] <gnarf> right
[09:23:20] <kswedberg> cool. gotta run. back after lunch
[09:23:25] <gnarf> the "olddisplay" data from .hide/.show animations would be another example
[10:04:59] <tbranyen> jrburke: do you have an amd/require channel?
[10:05:21] <jrburke> tbranyen: there is a requirejs irc room on freenode
[10:05:51] <jrburke> but no general amd one. hmm maybe it would make sense, i'll ask on amd-implement
[10:06:02] <tbranyen> to requirejs!
[10:51:02] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin oh hai
[10:51:12] <rwaldron> sorry, I went to lunch right after i sent my last message
[10:51:26] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, whatshisname
[10:51:30] <rwaldron> re: sindresorhus, yep, I sure did
[10:51:55] <DaveMethvin> should we get him on the list?
[10:52:00] <DaveMethvin> prolly so
[10:52:47] <rwaldron> yes definitely
[10:53:14] <DaveMethvin> i can add it, just need an email
[10:53:16] <rwaldron> basically, I noticed him triaging a bunch of stuff
[10:53:19] <rwaldron> accurately
[10:53:27] <rwaldron> and then found that he was in here lurking
[10:53:34] <rwaldron> so i invited him into conversation
[10:53:41] <rwaldron> and gave him ticket_admin
[10:53:45] <DaveMethvin> poor sucker, he didn't see it coming
[10:54:00] <rwaldron> ahahaha
[10:54:15] <gnarf> its like a press gang
[10:54:24] <gnarf> you get abducted into the bugs-team
[10:54:38] <rwaldron> ahahahahaha
[10:54:46] <rwaldron> man... trac is so slooooowww
[10:55:02] <DaveMethvin> the database prolly needs some fixin
[10:55:03] <gnarf> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressment
[10:55:42] <DaveMethvin> i think mikesherov said he knew somthin about trac fixin
[10:56:39] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin invite sent
[10:56:48] <DaveMethvin> ok good, thanks
[10:56:52] <rwaldron> i think it's just that the user list is so long
[10:56:56] <DaveMethvin> and keep luring the kids into the van with candy rwaldron
[10:56:58] <rwaldron> it takes forever to load that page
[10:57:04] <rwaldron> will do
[11:22:52] <timmywil> jaubourg: yt?
[11:23:03] <timmywil> remember this one? docs#8084
[11:23:04] <bot-t> [#8084] jsonp transport overrides dataType: json setting (closed bug: wontfix) - http://jqbug.com/8084
[11:23:19] <timmywil> I just ran into this myself
[11:24:38] <timmywil> with the google v3 maps api
[11:26:12] <timmywil> maybe it's not related.  i'm still debugging
[11:27:10] <rwaldron> hm
[11:28:00] <rwaldron> one of my first contributions was the detection of content-type JSON resulting in automattically parsed response
[11:28:09] <rwaldron> in the form of a "patch"
[11:28:34] <rwaldron> in which John actually re-worked and landed himself
[11:29:56] <timmywil> for some reason, the callback I am passing to getJSON is not getting attached to the window.  However, ajax is attaching the appropriate callback name (with the jQuery expando and such), but it is set to undefined for some reason
[11:30:04] <timmywil> - for some reason
[11:30:45] <timmywil> I'm switching to ajax and setting the dataType directly to see if there's an issue with the detection
[11:30:55] <rwaldron> hm
[11:30:56] <rwaldron> well...
[11:31:09] <rwaldron> what i said is clearly un-effing-related.
[11:31:11] <rwaldron> :D
[11:31:19] <timmywil> heh, sry
[11:31:38] <rwaldron> sorry for what?
[11:31:47] <timmywil> your face
[11:32:10] <timmywil> ;)
[11:51:22] <timmywil> hmm same thing
[11:51:39] <timmywil> lemme see if i can fiddle this
[11:57:07] <ajpiano> The devil went down to jQuery, he was looking for a soul to steal.  He was in a bind 'cos he was way behind and he was willin' to make a deal.  When he came across this young man sawin' on a jsjsFiddle and playin' it hot.  And the devil jumped upon a hickory stump and said: "Boy let me tell you what: "
[11:57:18] <ajpiano> I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a jsFiddle player too.  "And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.  "Now you play a pretty good jsFiddle, boy, but give the devil his due: "I bet a jsFiddle of gold against your soul, 'cos I think I'm better than you." The boy said: "My name's Timmy and it might be a sin, "But I'll take your bet, your gonna regret, 'cos I'm the best that's ever been."
[12:03:42] <timmywil> hahaha
[12:04:04] <timmywil> bot-t: jsfiddle is what ajpiano said
[12:04:05] <bot-t> timmywil, Changed "jsfiddle".
[12:04:13] <ajpiano> :/
[12:04:23] <ajpiano> i had a good factoid in there for jsfiddle
[12:04:23] <ajpiano> :p
[12:04:24] <timmywil> oops, didn't think i actually had access to that
[12:04:37] <timmywil> my bad
[12:04:56] <timmywil> i can fix it
[12:05:20] <rwaldron> timmywil...
[12:05:23] <rwaldron> your mom
[12:05:59] <timmywil> ugh, where's bot-t's logs
[12:06:30] <rwaldron> timmywil http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hP0kWqJJZa4
[12:07:21] <ajpiano> timmywil: don't worry about it
[12:07:21] <timmywil> found it
[12:07:42] <ajpiano> so did i :p
[12:08:01] <timmywil> bot-t: jsfiddle is jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your
[12:08:02] <timmywil>  issue and pres
[12:08:02] <bot-t> timmywil, Changed "jsfiddle".
[12:08:11] <timmywil> too long?

[12:11:09] <timmywil> rwaldron: see anything weird? http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/QpStq/1/
[12:11:57] <gnarf> h btw
[12:12:01] <gnarf> ?livequery
[12:12:02] <bot-t> livequery is the devil. stay away from its evil temptation
[12:12:11] <gnarf> finally did that
[12:12:24] <gnarf> tired of people suggesting it in #jquery :)
[12:12:58] <timmywil> rwaldron: haha, i used to love ren
[12:13:14] <timmywil> gnarf: good call
[12:14:02] <rwaldron> timmywil this is strange...
[12:14:21] <gnarf> ajpiano: i think you could make like "sawing" into "typin" and "playin" into codin, and "hot" into "hawt"
[12:14:38] <gnarf> then we could totally get jon neal to record it
[12:14:53] <gnarf> or aybe rick
[12:14:58] <gnarf> :)
[12:15:20] <gnarf> "The devil went down to jQuery"
[12:15:24] <rwaldron> I'll sing it.
[12:15:42] <gnarf> can you jam out the fiddle part in punk style guitar? :)
[12:15:43] <timmywil> and rapped by jau-bore
[12:19:14] <rwaldron> timmywil I know what the problem is...
[12:19:23] <rwaldron> this thing your requesting is the API
[12:19:27] <rwaldron> not json or jsonp
[12:19:54] <rwaldron> timmywil http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/QpStq/5/
[12:19:55] <rwaldron> works
[12:20:00] <rwaldron> dataType: "script"
[12:20:22] <timmywil> oh im dumb
[12:20:41] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/x3qUt/
[12:20:44] <timmywil> i immediately think jsonp when attaching a callback to the url
[12:20:45] <rwaldron> i removed the type: get
[12:21:00] <rwaldron> (that i added)
[12:23:28] <timmywil> thanks, brain fart
