[18:06:35] <TimLoal> is the jquery channel on here official or or have any accountability if not is there a better more official/professional arena to discuss jquery?
[18:45:21] <DaveMethvin> TimLoal: the #jquery channel is probably what you want, or jquery on StackOverflow
[21:04:44] <TimLoal> hi DaveMethvin, yes #jQuery would be a good place but who is in charge of the ops, because who insult and abuse people, which is not a good reflection of the jQuery project
[22:48:29] <DaveMethvin> TimLoal: I reviewed the log here (http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/default_%23jquery_20160814.log.html#t12:09:57) and I understand their frustration, I don't see that they made a personal attack on you.
[22:51:40] <DaveMethvin> The people on #jquery offer to help others for free, they expect that someone clearly state their issue
[22:52:24] <DaveMethvin> Your own comments there were not exactly friendly to someone who was helping you for free
