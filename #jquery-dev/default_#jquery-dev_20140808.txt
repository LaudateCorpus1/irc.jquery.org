[06:38:28] <leobalter> about your question in #625
[06:38:41] <leobalter> this is what I'm about to submit in a new PR
[06:39:56] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15leobalter opened pull request #626: Callbacks: Register only function callbacks (06master...06625-callback-fn) 02http://git.io/AxQWHA
[06:41:09] <JamesMGreene> leobalter: Does `QUnit.objectType` account for native host object functions?  I can't recall
[06:42:03] <leobalter> Not sure. https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/src/core.js#L308-L339
[06:42:11] <leobalter> I don't think so
[06:47:01] <JamesMGreene> If we care, I guess you'd want to try something like this in oldIE:  Object.prototype.toString.call( window.setTimeout ).match( /^\[object\s(.*)\]$/ )[1]
[06:50:00] <JamesMGreene> You know what?  I'd just skip it and stick to custom functions only
[06:50:08] <JamesMGreene> the host functions are a pain in the ass
[06:50:14] <JamesMGreene> Some have `call` methods, some don't, etc.
[06:59:52] <leobalter> we're not using call anymore: config.callbacks[ key ].push( callback );
[07:03:01] <leobalter> JamesMGreene: regarding it, that PR looks good?
[07:04:36] <leobalter> btw: var log = Function.prototype.call.bind(console.log, console) // wtf
[07:06:23] <JamesMGreene> leobalter: Do `QUnit.log` callbacks get dispatched BEFORE the assertions are finished? o_O
[07:06:40] <JamesMGreene> That would seem odd to me but seems to be what your test is suggesting...?
[07:07:23] <leobalter> good call, that should fail!
[07:09:02] <leobalter> ok, I need to isolate that.
[07:09:14] <leobalter> It's passing when I have the other tests together
[07:12:54] <leobalter> JamesMGreene: commit amended
[07:15:52] <leobalter> pushed.
