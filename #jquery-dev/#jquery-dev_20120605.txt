[08:53:00] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Create special "grunt watch" task called "dev" - Rick Waldron
[08:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> ralphholzmann: We know, but it doesn't help with the slow browsers.
[08:53:29] <ralphholzmann> scott_gonzalez: I understand that
[08:53:44] <ralphholzmann> but there are es5 getters available in slow browsers
[08:53:46] <ralphholzmann> such as mobile
[08:55:37] <ralphholzmann> certainly there's interest in improving mobile perf across the board
[08:56:05] <jzaefferer> hey rwaldron, want to help some more with QUnit docs? One thing that remains is converting the existing API docs to https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com - mostly content editing
[08:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> The first step would be getting mobile results on that page...
[08:58:02] <rwaldron> jzaefferer does qunitjs.com still use the same setup that we had when did the dev days work?
[08:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: no more docpad
[08:58:46] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: nope, docpad is gone :-)
[08:59:10] <jzaefferer> ralphholzmann: on stock Android ICS (4.0.4) browser, that jsperf test fails to run at all
[08:59:25] <rwaldron> ugh
[08:59:32] <rwaldron> what is it now?
[08:59:39] <jqcommit> [jquery] rwldrn pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/TqHjFg
[08:59:39] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Adds "grunt submodules" docs to readme, removes old make command docs - Rick Waldron
[08:59:55] <ralphholzmann> jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez i see that, perhaps I spoke too soon
[09:00:22] <ralphholzmann> if we get the fiddle fixed up for mobile, and it shows substantial results on ios and android, would it be something you would consider?
[09:00:46] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: the WordPress based deployment, as with any of the other sites. Though to edit API docs, you don't really need to deploy, just run `grunt` to view the html files
[09:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> That's a question for DaveMethvin. Last time we discussed this (maybe a month ago?) he wasn't really interested.
[09:01:17] <jzaefferer> Running on Opera Mobile now, same device
[09:01:22] <jzaefferer> At least that doesn't error out instantly
[09:01:25] <ralphholzmann> gotcha
[09:01:50] <jzaefferer> Opera Mobile 12 should show up in the results now
[09:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> 3x
[09:02:23] <scott_gonzalez> That's about the average across all.
[09:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> Some show better, like 5x.
[09:02:40] <DaveMethvin> ralphholzmann: have you encountered that as a bottleneck?
[09:02:52] <ralphholzmann> DaveMethvin on mobile, yes :/
[09:02:57] <DaveMethvin> doing what?
[09:02:57] <ralphholzmann> had to write my own drag and drop implementation
[09:03:06] <ralphholzmann> cause plumbing through jquery was too slow for android
[09:03:16] <rwaldron> ralphholzmann I cant even run that on Mobile Safari
[09:03:29] <ralphholzmann> rwaldron yeah
[09:03:33] <rwaldron> Something throws a TypeError exception...
[09:03:36] <DaveMethvin> so it should work to use that plugin, right?
[09:03:46] <rwaldron> so how does this work better on mobile?
[09:03:55] <ralphholzmann> safari requires both a setter and a getter
[09:03:56] <DaveMethvin> brb
[09:04:00] <jzaefferer> meh, Chrome for Android gets detected as Chrome 18.0.1025
[09:04:07] <rwaldron> ralphholzmann ok...
[09:04:14] <rwaldron> can you fix so I can run on mobile safari?
[09:04:17] <ralphholzmann> rwaldron we'll get it fixed up
[09:04:18] <ralphholzmann> yeah
[09:05:00] <rwaldron> I can't run this in older browsers to add a comparison
[09:05:46] <rwaldron> can you feature detect the "fix" so this perf can run on all browsers that we support so a "bigger picture" comparison can be made?
[09:06:39] <ralphholzmann> sure
[09:06:59] <rwaldron> thanks dude
[09:08:16] <timmywil> rwaldron: are you aware of the dist task issue in grunt?
[09:09:08] <rwaldron> hm
[09:09:09] <rwaldron> nope
[09:09:25] <rwaldron> is it related to you relativization
[09:09:28] <rwaldron> timmywil ^
[09:09:34] <timmywil> when running dist without providing a file location, it creates a folder called "*"
[09:09:44] <rwaldron> oh snap
[09:09:46] <rwaldron> will fix
[09:11:05] <timmywil> thanks man :)
[09:17:01] <rwaldron> timmywil fixed!

[09:17:06] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Don't create "*" dir when "grunt dist" is run without explicit destination dir. (thanks @timmywil) - Rick Waldron
[09:17:07] <rwaldron> it now does nothing!
[09:17:11] <rwaldron> wooo!
[09:17:27] <timmywil> cool, thanks
[09:17:31] <DaveMethvin> great work rwaldron, i can always count on you to do nothing! :P
[09:18:01] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron i had a question about that, are you adding dest on the command line?
[09:18:11] <DaveMethvin> or is there a config file it can draw from as well?
[09:18:18] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin mikesherov's modular dimensions patch is looking good
[09:18:37] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin we could do either
[09:18:57] <DaveMethvin> well i don't want to touch the project's grunt.js to add my local dest
[09:19:02] <rwaldron> right
[09:19:08] <DaveMethvin> so i wondered if there's like a .gruntrc or somethign
[09:19:34] <rwaldron> That's a great idea
[09:19:43] <DaveMethvin> i mean i can always alias gg grunt ... etc
[09:20:11] <DaveMethvin> plus i don't know if a per-user gruntrc is right since the grunt is per-project
[09:20:55] <rwaldron> Not sure how I would solve it at the moment
[09:21:02] <rwaldron> but I think it's worth exploring
[09:21:14] <DaveMethvin> i'll use an alias
[09:21:52] <DaveMethvin> which of course has the same drawback as the .gruntrc approach, gg will run the same command across projects
[09:23:31] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #107: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/107/
[09:23:32] <jq-jenkins> waldron.rick: Create special "grunt watch" task called "dev"
[09:25:50] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I spoke to ben_alman and we both came up with the same idea
[09:26:38] <rwaldron> special json file (that ships with the repo), imported into grunt, values parsed, destination for "dist" is set.
[09:26:41] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^
[09:27:15] <DaveMethvin> so how would it know where my local dropbox folder was for example?
[09:27:34] <rwaldron> you would type that value into the special json file
[09:27:42] <DaveMethvin> but it comes with the repo?
[09:27:51] <rwaldron> i dunno
[09:27:54] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:27:54] <rwaldron> maybe not
[09:28:13] <DaveMethvin> i could use an env var i guess
[09:28:16] <rwaldron> it will be treated the same way .sizecache.json is treated
[09:28:27] <rwaldron> gitignored and such
[09:28:36] <rwaldron> so i guess it wont ship with the repo
[09:28:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would work
[09:29:02] <rwaldron> cool
[09:29:06] <DaveMethvin> so, optional but if it's there it would suck that in
[09:29:23] <rwaldron> exactly
[09:29:29] <rwaldron> and we'll put all that in the readme
[09:29:33] <rwaldron> I can do this now
[09:29:43] <DaveMethvin> cool thanks!
[09:29:49] <rwaldron> no problem!
[09:30:05] <ben_alman> fwiw if you use the '<json:foo.json>' directive in grunt config, it will error if foo.json is missing
[09:30:36] <ben_alman> perhaps an option could be added to allow the file to not exist
[09:30:54] <ben_alman> or an alternate directive that defaults to {}
[09:30:56] <ben_alman> but i dunno
[09:31:08] <DaveMethvin> maybe we could provide an empty one in the project but gitignore it? not sure if that is possible
[09:31:11] <ben_alman> you could also read the json file manually
[09:31:20] <ben_alman> and only use it if it exists
[09:31:25] <ben_alman> and even log if it does
[09:31:29] <rwaldron> yeah, I'm going to go that route
[09:31:33] <rwaldron> seems easier
[09:32:21] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin where is the easiest place to put this file
[09:32:23] <rwaldron> also... name?
[09:33:38] <rwaldron> Since I'm not using <json:file.json>, maybe I can make this easier then a json file...
[09:36:32] <ben_alman> rwaldron: https://gist.github.com/2876125
[09:36:58] <rwaldron> word
[09:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Reminder: call in 10 minutes.

[11:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> Go save the project.
[11:18:38] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: wat?
[11:18:44] <ajpiano> oh
[11:18:45] <ajpiano> god
[11:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> Dear Graeme, jQuery is probably not for you. Good thing you saw right through us. Sorry to disappoint. Sincerely, jQuery.
[11:19:57] <ajpiano> well no it's like
[11:20:02] <ajpiano> i can see how he thinks he's being helpful
[11:20:31] <ajpiano> but like
[11:20:35] <scott_gonzalez> We should just wait till the new sites launch and be like "Thanks Graeme, We took your advice and spent some time improving the site."
[11:20:37] <ajpiano> a) we know the websites aren't great
[11:20:43] <ajpiano> and are redoing
[11:20:46] <ajpiano> haha
[11:21:19] <ajpiano> b) we don't have a problem of not getting adopters
[11:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? is docs.jquery.com down?
[11:23:01] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: came right up for me
[11:23:07] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i dont even know how to reply to this
[11:23:26] <ajpiano> it's so overwhelming
[11:23:44] <ajpiano> we aren't "selling" jquery and we aren't worried about our "conversion rates"
[11:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> bah, my fault.
[11:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> I have a bad habit of typing docs[tab]
[11:24:09] <scott_gonzalez> Which Chrome always completes to docs.google.com
[11:24:25] <scott_gonzalez> And when I hit enter it switched to https, and docs.jquery.com doesn't load over https :-P
[11:24:42] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i have the problem of going to "docs.jquery.com" when we're on a call and need to load up a google doc
[11:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:25:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I don't know how to respond to that email.
[11:25:12] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: should i ask him for directions to the magical town where screencasts fall out of trees
[11:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[11:25:32] <gnarf> timmywil: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11842#comment:2 ?
[11:25:35] <ajpiano> i think a short little like
[11:25:49] <gnarf> timmywil: any idea whats going on for this?
[11:26:06] <ajpiano> "Yes, we're aware that the website is dated and needs improvement and we're working on a new design etc etc"
[11:26:07] <scott_gonzalez> We should just post one of the rails screencasts and be like "This uses jQuery for some stuff."
[11:26:22] <ajpiano> but it's like
[11:26:31] <ajpiano> i am considerably *more* shocked that someone would tap out this entire e-mail
[11:26:44] <ajpiano> than the fact that .. google autocomplete isn't excatly the most complimentary thing in the world
[11:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:26:59] <ajpiano> type in ANY male celebrity's name into google and the next thing it autocompletes to is "gay"
[11:27:00] <ajpiano> so
[11:27:24] <ajpiano> this is not exactly a barometer of reality by which one should coordinate one's life or projects
[11:27:43] <timmywil> gnarf: yea, it has to do with selector divisions for element-rooted selections using QSA
[11:27:48] <timmywil> I'm working on it
[11:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/3i3K1p291r2903333N1o
[11:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> 50% is pretty good
[11:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, it's the Internet...
[11:28:12] <gnarf> timmywil: cool - just wanted to make sure you saw that ticket - dupe it or whatever ;)
[11:28:22] <timmywil> gnarf: thx!
[11:33:01] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: do you wanna take this or shal i
[11:33:15] <scott_gonzalez> You, please.
[11:33:17] <ajpiano> :|
[11:33:18] <ajpiano> ok
[11:33:26] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise I might take out my hatred of SVN and jqueryui.com on him :-P
[11:34:06] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery UI releases are even more painful now that I've stopped using Eclipse.
[11:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> I actually have to deal with SVN on the command line.
[11:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: http://cl.ly/3O2V3R0s1G472L0T332g
[11:41:54] <gnarf> huh
[11:42:23] <gnarf> that seems like an obscure error message there
[11:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> It says that the file are "switched"
[11:44:38] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/18030k0t373T3v1W0C33
[11:45:00] <scott_gonzalez> Should I try deleting the testing dir and re-running?
[12:00:53] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ?
[12:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...I just re-ran cron.sh and it didn't complain.
[12:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> Still shows all the files as switched though.
[12:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well, I don't know what that tag is used for anyway.
[12:04:54] <scott_gonzalez> I was able to download 1.8.21 from staging, so I'm just going to ignore it.
[12:08:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: alright - good - cuz that svn error was strage
[12:08:33] <scott_gonzalez> I hate SVN
[12:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> I can't wait for the new site.
[12:08:59] <scott_gonzalez> I also hate that we need to deploy to the staging server just to complete the release process.
[12:30:19] <jqcommit> [jquery] rwldrn pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/3GMbPQ
[12:30:19] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Make dimensions modular, adds optional build flag. Fixes #11856 - Mike Sherov
[12:40:39] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I just updated the CDN listing and I'm seeing different results for code.jquery.com and code.jquery.com/index.html
[12:41:02] <scott_gonzalez> Now it's updated.
[12:41:06] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it's not instant?
[12:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, does it cache locally for a minute or something?
[12:56:27] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: fsf extremism?
[12:56:30] <DaveMethvin> geez
[12:58:30] <ajpiano> this is just that guy following up on his earlier complaint
[12:58:54] <ajpiano> maybe the same place where the magical free awesome screencasts come from also has a free-as-in-freedom jsfiddle version
[12:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You know you just set him up with "It's certainly free as in no cost."
[13:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know what freedoms we're giving up by using jsFiddle?
[13:00:26] <ajpiano> he's the one coming to a project saying "hey, go build a new tool so i can feel better about myself"

[13:02:04] <ajpiano> well there's free as in no cost, free as in freedom
[13:02:09] <ajpiano> and now there's "free as in freeloading"
[13:02:19] <ajpiano> as in "you guys go build a completely open jsfiddle!"
[13:02:59] <ajpiano> ok i need to biuld this desk. i'm sitting on the floor and typing on my tv stand
[13:03:00] <ajpiano> :|
[13:08:22] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin not the first time
[13:08:33] <rwaldron> did you see the one I closed about drag/drop?
[13:08:39] <rwaldron> relatedTarget being null?
[13:08:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:08:51] <rwaldron> they claimed it was jQuery's fault, but wouldnt create test case
[13:09:00] <danheberden> specs are for sissies
[13:09:01] <rwaldron> turns out that's how the spec says it should be
[13:09:17] <DaveMethvin> WELL THE SPEC IS RONG
[13:09:29] <DaveMethvin> IT SHOULD BE FREE TOO
[13:09:49] <danheberden> ?mlu
[13:09:51] <rwaldron> d-bags
[13:11:10] <danheberden> it's like giving someone a brand new car, and they're like "but i want one of those backup cameras!" - just turn your head, gheesh
[13:11:55] <rwaldron> I hate the tone
[13:24:23] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'm pulling the last commit out. When I was testing this patch, nothing was failing except for the test that I reported to mike in the PR. Now that it's in, I'm seeing a consistent failure
[13:24:30] <rwaldron> so it's coming out.
[13:24:50] <rwaldron> the issue is that "width" could be called from core
[13:25:09] <DaveMethvin> let's figure it out first
[13:25:09] <rwaldron> if i do.. jQuery("<div/>", { width: 10 })
[13:25:18] <rwaldron> I did
[13:25:21] <DaveMethvin> to me that's a use of dimensions though
[13:25:25] <rwaldron> yes
[13:25:28] <rwaldron> exactly
[13:25:33] <rwaldron> if i build -dimensions
[13:25:49] <rwaldron> which is what mike's patch introduced...
[13:25:57] <rwaldron> then I'm dead in the water
[13:26:01] <rwaldron> UNLESS
[13:26:03] <DaveMethvin> right, but if you the developer build without dimensions you made a mistake by saying jQuery("<div/>", { width: 10 })
[13:26:08] <rwaldron> we want to run it conditionally?
[13:26:11] <rwaldron> like the other tests?
[13:26:12] <DaveMethvin> because  you lied to us
[13:26:20] <rwaldron> fair enough
[13:26:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's just that test needs to be redone
[13:26:27] <DaveMethvin> conditionally
[13:26:36] <rwaldron> I'll just split it into two tests
[13:26:41] <rwaldron> and wrap it in conditions
[13:26:43] <DaveMethvin> that would work fine
[13:26:49] <rwaldron> one with "width" and one without
[13:26:55] <DaveMethvin> or we can deprecate jQuery("<div/>", { width: 10 }) /cc scott_gonzalez
[13:27:01] <DaveMethvin> :D
[13:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[13:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> You guys are silly with the closing slash.
[13:28:05] <DaveMethvin> if someone is building and saying they don't use dimensions, we will need to make it clear what that means
[13:28:40] <DaveMethvin> jQuery("html", props) is a sneak path into lots of functionality, but if you control the props it's not a problem
[13:29:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's like the best parts of jQuery all rolled into one API :-)
[13:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> Can we add a way to start an animation as soon as it's created?
[13:29:33] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery( "<div>", { animate: { height: 500 } } );
[13:29:45] <DaveMethvin> kind of like combining the appetizer, main course, and dessert all in one pile!
[13:29:47] <DaveMethvin> mmmm
[13:30:13] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...that might actually work.
[13:30:15] * DaveMethvin slaps scott_gonzalez
[13:31:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it totally does.
[13:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> $.attrFn.animate = true;
[13:31:44] <scott_gonzalez> $( "<div>", { "class": "ui-widget-header", animate: { height: 500 } }).appendTo( "body" ) :-)
[13:31:48] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez the closing slash is the result of me copy/pasting
[13:32:00] <rwaldron> I don't buy into that voodoo
[13:32:44] <DaveMethvin> it works in that case b/c the height starts at 0, but not in general i'd think
[13:33:29] <scott_gonzalez> OH SO AWESOME
[13:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> $.attrFn.load = true;
[13:33:35] <gibson042> just add everything to attrFn!
[13:33:46] <scott_gonzalez> $( "<div>", { load: "content.html" });
[13:33:56] <gibson042> $("<div>", {after: "body>*:last"})
[13:34:11] <gibson042> $("<div>", {load: url})
[13:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: You're a genius!
[13:34:31] <DaveMethvin> i'm calling the police
[13:34:34] <gibson042> wooo
[13:35:07] <scott_gonzalez> So silly of me to chain .appendTo() when I can just $.attrFn.appendTo = true!
[13:35:28] <rwaldron> ok DaveMethvin looking good over here.
[13:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> Best plugin idea ever: $.extend( $.attrFn, $.fn );
[13:36:07] <gibson042> lol
[13:37:25] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, can you nest attr to "chain' inside the object?
[13:38:36] <jqcommit> [jquery] rwldrn pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Vftscg
[13:38:36] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix busted tests that relied on width in 2nd param to jQuery(), dimensions stays modular. (core, attributes, offset) - Rick Waldron
[13:38:42] <rwaldron> ta-da
[13:39:22] <DaveMethvin> see rwaldron? no retreat! :D
[13:41:06] <rwaldron> I got nervous!
[13:41:12] <rwaldron> 0_0
[13:41:51] <rwaldron> So, we're just barely over 30k gzipped if you drop effects and dimensions
[13:42:24] <DaveMethvin> so once we come up with a lopper for ajax I think that's about it
[13:42:36] <rwaldron> agreed
[13:42:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, we'll be down to about 5k at that point.
[13:42:47] <DaveMethvin> but imagine what we can cut when we get rid of oldIE
[13:42:49] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[13:42:52] <DaveMethvin> there's a lot more than you think
[13:43:04] <paul_irish> woo!
[13:43:06] <DaveMethvin> we need to revisit some design decisions at that point too
[13:43:12] <rwaldron> +1
[13:43:18] <DaveMethvin> like, attach data directly to elements
[13:43:20] <paul_irish> more es5
[13:43:35] <DaveMethvin> ve must use ze strict mode!
[13:43:43] <rwaldron> more ES5 means split path
[13:43:52] <paul_irish> why split
[13:43:52] <rwaldron> we need better ways to do things in one path
[13:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Think about the Chinese users!
[13:44:01] <rwaldron> because for example...
[13:44:08] <rwaldron> Safari is a modern browser
[13:44:12] <rwaldron> but doesnt support bind
[13:44:13] <paul_irish> no fn.bind
[13:44:16] <rwaldron> off the top of my head
[13:44:18] <paul_irish> but like. thats it.
[13:44:50] <paul_irish> and modernizr is polyfilling that already
[13:44:55] <rwaldron> I guess I was thinking that IE8 was still there
[13:45:06] <paul_irish> i'm thinking ie8 is not part of the equation
[13:45:07] <DaveMethvin> scortched earth
[13:45:15] <DaveMethvin> ie8 is not even a number
[13:45:28] <DaveMethvin> we can prevent chinese users by adding "Tianenmen Square" to the header comments, then blame it on their govt
[13:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, we can be more discreet. There are specific numbers that get blocke.
[13:50:03] <scott_gonzalez> *blocked.
[13:51:47] <rwaldron> sorry, stepped away.
[13:55:03] <danheberden> paul_irish is google not going to host jqueryui themes any longer?
[13:56:35] <rwaldron> paul_irish Function.prototype.bind can't be shimmed correctly, because it's not possible to set the length or to remove the "prototype" property from the resulting bound function
[13:56:47] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: It's not just themes.
[13:56:58] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.20 isn't on Google CDN at all.
[13:57:37] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I released 1.8.21 today...
[13:57:41] <danheberden> oy
[13:58:03] <danheberden> addyosmani paul_irish input please? ^
[13:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> Working on the site deploy right now...
[14:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: So as crazy as this sounds, would you feel like $( html, props ) was less magical if we dropped $.attrFn and just checked $.fn?
[14:08:51] <shoky> 1.8.21 ! thanks scott_gonzalez !!
[14:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:09:04] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #111: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/111/
[14:09:04] <jq-jenkins> waldron.rick: Fix busted tests that relied on width in 2nd param to jQuery(), dimensions stays modular. (core, attributes, offset)
[14:09:13] <rwaldron> ugh
[14:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> With no links to CDNs :-P
[14:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> But our CDN has 1.8.21, so that's good.
[14:14:14] <paul_irish> well
[14:15:21] <paul_irish> i'm a little concerned that it isnt doing jquery ui users any good.
[14:16:00] <paul_irish> 21 minor releases and spread across two CDNs mean a pretty low chance of a positive cache hit
[14:16:54] <danheberden> we boast the google cdn as the goto cdn, and jquery as a fallback - i'm comfortable supporting only google if that's what it takes; but we'd need commitment on being able to push versions in a timely manner
[14:17:51] <paul_irish> tbh what's been happening is burnout due to all the minors
[14:18:05] <paul_irish> it's not an automated process for us and we can't make it one either
[14:18:35] <scott_gonzalez> How complicated is the process?
[14:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> We release once per month.
[14:19:02] <scott_gonzalez> I realize other projects have releases too...
[14:19:46] <danheberden> well we *are* the only one that often and with all the themese
[14:19:49] <danheberden> *themes even
[14:20:01] <danheberden> the problem is we've boasted google all this time
[14:20:11] <danheberden> and now to have google back out is kinda sucky
[14:20:27] <paul_irish> yes.
[14:20:59] <paul_irish> erm.
[14:21:07] <paul_irish> can we go sexychat for a moment
[14:21:19] <paul_irish>  /join #jquery-dev-ot
[14:21:43] <rwaldron>  /join #jquery-dev-ot
[14:21:47] <rwaldron> wat
[14:21:54] <rwaldron> stupid space.

[19:21:31] <gf3> Hello
[19:21:37] <mikesherov> Hi, what's up?
[19:21:47] <gf3> Absolutely nothing
[19:21:51] <gf3> Yourself?
[19:21:56] <mikesherov> oh, did you ping me?
[19:22:29] <gf3> I WOULD NEVER, HOW DARE YOU ACCUSE ME OF SUCH A THING
[19:22:40] <mikesherov> LOL
[19:42:58] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I have to modularize offset before I modularize css, as css supports effects, dimensions, and offset. So I'm adding that to my queue as well
