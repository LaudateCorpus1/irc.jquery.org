[08:17:52] <jqcommit> 13jquery/06master 148a79be7 15jaubourg: Simplifies how url is kept devoid of anti-cache parameter for ifModified requests. Also, renames ifModifiedKey to cacheURL so that it now conveys the variable's nature rather than its purpose. -5 min/gzipped.

[13:21:35] <ryanneufeld> Are we removing ajax: false ?
[13:21:40] <ryanneufeld> like all together?
[13:24:39] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: ^^ ?
[13:25:03] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: ajax:false?
[13:25:22] <ryanneufeld> Yes, the option to $.ajax()
[13:25:29] <ryanneufeld> I thought I read somewhere we weren't going to disable it

[13:26:10] <ryanneufeld> I read that on the docs
[13:26:24] <ryanneufeld> makes sense that you can't use deferreds with it though
[13:26:30] <DaveMethvin> right now it works with them but we don't want to guarantee
[14:40:33] <ryanneufeld> ah
