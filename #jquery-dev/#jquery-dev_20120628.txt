[07:07:21] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] CSS: .swarm-results should not wrap - Timo Tijhof
[07:09:06] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: https://integration.mediawiki.org/testswarm/job/3491/ (with human testers) -> http://integration.wmflabs.org/testswarm/job/3 (browserstack)
[07:09:14] <Krinkle> looks like an improvement I'd say
[07:09:15] <Krinkle> :D
[07:09:37] <Krinkle> also, we've added all browsers in comply with wmf traffic statistics (e.g. 90%)
[07:10:03] <Krinkle> firefox is slow in upgrading
[07:10:21] <Krinkle> we kicked off Opera 11.1 and 11.5, as well as Chrome < 16
[08:00:41] <Gho5t> so i tried to figure out how to contribute to jquery, but it seems like from what i'm reading they want you to submit a bug and then fix it?
[08:00:50] <Gho5t> in order to get started
[08:03:51] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: job not found, for the wmflabs link
[08:05:33] <miketaylr> Gho5t: most people are at jqcon right now, but you could talk to rwaldron or DaveMethvin if you want to get involved
[08:06:33] <Gho5t> ok
[08:06:36] <Gho5t> so PM them?
[08:08:24] <miketaylr> Gho5t: not necessary, just when they're around
[08:08:35] <Gho5t> ok
[09:11:12] <gdoron> Hi, I got a question, why jQuery is wrapped by a function with the two parameters "function( window, undefined ) {" while it's invoked only with one : "})( window );"
[09:11:50] <gdoron> Anyone home...? :)
[09:13:01] <gdoron> Does someone monitor this chat room? Am I in the right place for this kind of questions?
[09:14:01] <nacin> gdoron: most people are at jqcon, and the better place would be #jquery. but note that this construct allows a minifier to shorten the reserved word "undefined" as it is simply an argument inside the closure.
[09:15:44] <gdoron> ummm, I thought it tries to save from cases where someone is hiding undefined with a local variable with that name.
[09:16:08] <nacin> yes, that too. but then why'd you ask? :)
[09:17:00] <gdoron> Because it doesn't do that... in the minified version : "(function(a,b){"
[09:17:08] <gdoron> undefined is now b...
[09:18:13] <gdoron> @nacin, Did you got me?
[09:18:28] <nacin> and since only (window) is passed in, then b===undefined. tell me, how many instances of the word undefined do you find in http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.js?
[09:18:37] <nacin> now look for it in http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.2.min.js
[09:19:40] <gdoron> 18
[09:20:13] <nacin> and in the unminified version?
[09:20:14] <gdoron> Why are you asking?
[09:21:08] <gdoron> @nacin in the development version 120 (including comments!)
[09:21:40] <nacin> so, something like 800 bytes saved just from that one trick.
[09:25:20] <gdoron> And why do I still find those 18 instances? (They are using the "undefined" string literal instead of the undefined variable- using typeof)

[12:33:02] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Yeah, I reset it (its a vm)
[12:33:33] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: anyway, that was a burst of enthusiasm. After working on it here with you, felt right to finally get it running there :)
[12:33:46] <Krinkle> (I would've done that earlier, but the environment wasn't ready yet)

[14:17:01] <jzaefferer> Would've been great to have you here at the conference
[14:17:21] <jzaefferer> I'll do a breakout session soon to talk about some of that
[14:17:24] <Krinkle> Yeah, I wanted to be there :) next time

[16:28:19] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: so, as you may have heard, window.opener is not going to help us
[16:29:45] <Krinkle> The only solution is to not have a master RunPage. The RunPage would redirect to the test suite, and from there inject.js will use JSONP or (instead of postMessage or <form> POST), and then redirect back to the RunPage to idle etc.
[16:30:04] <Krinkle> but that brings the obvious problem of.. what if execution dies in that window?
