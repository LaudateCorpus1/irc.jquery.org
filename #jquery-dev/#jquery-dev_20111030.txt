[00:49:31] <gnarf> i wonder why people like feel offended if we dismiss their report
[10:52:16] <gnarf> timmywil: do you know what held up RC2?
[10:54:22] <timmywil> yea, our invisible body in support is still causing crashes in IE8 and some mobile browsers
[10:54:47] <gnarf> boo
[10:55:05] <timmywil> we'd like to fix that before releasing rc2, but I'm not sure what to do about it yet
[11:59:00] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gnarf: so what do you guys think about this second-body prob with IE8? I think it might be the cause of the other issue reported with the blackberry simulator that crashes only a few lines down
[11:59:41] * gnarf shrugs - is there any way we can detect the problem?
[11:59:54] <timmywil> i can reproduce the ie8 crash
[12:00:14] <timmywil> maybe we should just defer the offset tests until doc ready?
[12:00:45] <DaveMethvin> that also means we do them in a div ... we can't use a body at that point i surmised from the code?
[12:00:55] <DaveMethvin> so there must be some tickets to reopen as a result
[12:01:13] <timmywil> we can use the real body at that point
[12:01:58] <DaveMethvin> well we have the real body in document.body for everything but frameset docs, even in the head I am pretty sure
[12:02:23] <DaveMethvin> maybe the workaround i had for frameset docs was confusing things?
[12:03:00] <timmywil> this has always been a problem. i don't think we actually have a body when in the head (hence the fake body)
[12:03:37] <timmywil> and why there are never crashes when jQuery is included at the bottom of the body
[12:04:03] <DaveMethvin> for that blackberry ticket the guy said he still got the crash when he put it at the bottom
[12:04:21] <DaveMethvin> i marked it as a blocker thinking it was related, and i think it still may be
[12:04:36] <DaveMethvin> in the past it was lazy-evaled so in many cases the code might not run at all
[12:04:51] <DaveMethvin> could be that bb just doesn't like that code :)
[12:05:21] <timmywil> well, we know the ie8 issue is related to the invisible body.  There is no invisible body if jQuery is included at the bottom.
[12:06:13] <timmywil> bb may be a different issue
[12:07:32] <timmywil> yea, also doesn't make sense why 1.6.4 wouldn't crash
[12:07:42] <timmywil> we haven't changed this code
[12:08:14] <DaveMethvin> if it's not consistent, it could just be some sort of timing or minor change issue that causes a wayward pointer
[12:08:23] <DaveMethvin> which is like the worst possible kind of bug
[12:11:07] <timmywil> gotta run for a bit
[12:38:08] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: if it's safe to do so, I can temporarily reference jquery-git.js in the api demos so we can test .on() and .off() demos. thoughts?
[12:38:40] <DaveMethvin> either that or the 1.7rc1 perhaps?
[12:38:53] <DaveMethvin> oh but wait that has the ie8 crash we're trying to fix
[12:39:07] <DaveMethvin> oh well it's temporary so it prolly doesn't matter
[12:39:23] <DaveMethvin> nobody in their right mind will be going to that page in ie8 :)
[12:39:44] <kswedberg> but if I change the reference, it'll change it for all api.jquery.com demos
[12:40:24] <DaveMethvin> i guess -git is fine temporarily, we shoudl be fixing it in the next day
[12:42:27] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: ok, well, tell you whatâ€¦ let's wait for the rc2 and then I'll ref -git and we can publish .on() and .off()
[12:42:45] <DaveMethvin> ok
[12:42:57] <kswedberg> all around the same time. will be nice to have those docs up before the actual release. awesome job on those, by the way!
[15:10:45] <addyosmani> heya DaveMethvin
[15:10:53] <DaveMethvin> hey addy
[15:11:06] <addyosmani> Great job on all the docs updates between you and Karl :)
[15:11:12] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[15:11:33] <addyosmani> I was wondering if you might know: if you're currently editing something and someone else begins editing/changing a page in Wordpress, does that overwrite your changes?
[15:11:58] <addyosmani> I noticed some very minor style-guide stuff that could be updated in .on() but didn't want to (destructively) update :)
[15:12:09] <DaveMethvin> not sure ... usually it says something about a newer version
[15:12:45] <addyosmani> that's cool. I'll wait until later/tomorrow in that case. Sure you guys have a lot left to do anyway!
[15:12:59] <DaveMethvin> i will prolly do changes to all these pages a lot over the next day as I am editing the others and notice i left something out, so yeah
[15:13:06] <DaveMethvin> then you can get your shot!
[15:13:09] <addyosmani> haha
[15:13:14] <addyosmani> Sounds good :D
[15:15:43] <addyosmani> oh! thanks for the docs mention by the way. It's been a life-long dream to be alerted on click!
[17:38:33] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yt?
[18:20:25] <Guest3863> hi
