[05:46:45] <scott_gonzalez> .
[05:57:29] <gibson042> .
[06:51:16] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042 and anyone else that's around: Does this look correct based on the discussion? http://cl.ly/image/0L3s0e3D3J3o
[07:13:32] <gibson042> scott_gonzalez: what does Function link to?
[07:23:38] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jquery.com/Types#Function
[07:49:19] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: why does http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js show 1.8.0 but http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latst.js shows 1.8.1?
[07:49:34] <kswedberg> * http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js
[07:49:45] <DaveMethvin> hmm, sounds like something didn't get copied ... i know the script does it
[07:50:05] <DaveMethvin> ht
[07:50:25] <kswedberg> k
[07:53:31] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: just tried re-copying them, no dice
[07:53:37] <kswedberg> weird
[07:53:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah the .min is okay
[07:54:10] <DaveMethvin> i really wish we didn't have so many aliases
[08:04:47] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I just tried to reload jquery.js, we'll see if it updates in a few minutes.
[08:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, that fixed it.
[08:10:02] <kswedberg> nice. thx scott_gonzalez
[08:25:25] <scott_gonzalez> boo http://cl.ly/image/3I361T1C1f1f
[08:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I'm not using BrowserStack on Chrome any more.
[08:34:44] <jaubourg> plop
[08:51:45] <kswedberg> jaubourg: hi!
[08:56:52] <jaubourg> hey Karl!
[08:57:04] <jaubourg> so, seems we'll share a room.. uh uh uh ;)
[08:57:33] <kswedberg> oh yeah! awesome. ;-)
[08:58:15] <jaubourg> yeah, can't wait for the event, promises to be awesome
[08:58:55] <kswedberg> def
[08:58:59] <kswedberg> so, btw, I think the $.Callbacks docs need some love.
[08:59:00] <jaubourg> you wouldn't know if there is a core meeting today with the day off your side of the ocean?
[08:59:06] <jaubourg> oh yes it does
[08:59:24] <jaubourg> we still don't document the options-in-an-object signature iirc
[08:59:38] <kswedberg> don't know about meeting today. probably not. DaveMethvin?
[09:00:34] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, meeting
[09:01:05] <DaveMethvin> i think we're in pretty good shape and since it's a holiday let's skip it
[09:01:17] <jaubourg> ok
[09:01:18] <DaveMethvin> regardless, hi kswedberg jaubourg
[09:01:26] <jaubourg> hey DaveMethvin
[09:01:31] <kswedberg> hey DaveMethvin
[09:02:10] <DaveMethvin> i dunno why scott_gonzalez was able to get the file unstuck, i guess the server just likes him better
[09:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> Of course it does.
[09:02:30] <jaubourg> The man who whispered at the servers ears
[09:02:51] <ryanneufeld> morning
[09:03:07] <jaubourg> hi ryan
[09:06:04] <kswedberg> jaubourg: sent you a PM.
[09:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: https://gist.github.com/b78068e8468dd259335f
[09:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> I can't think of anything else to make the demos work in IE.
[09:10:33] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that inline scripts are executing before remote scripts.
[09:10:42] <scott_gonzalez> s/remote/external/
[09:15:36] <kswedberg> that's annoying.
[09:15:52] <kswedberg> does using window.onload actually work?
[09:17:29] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, since it waits for scripts to load.
[09:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I think it's safe to just switch to about:blank instead of an actual empty page.
[09:19:40] <kswedberg> ok. yeah, saw that.
[09:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: ping
[09:40:42] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: sup
[09:40:52] <scott_gonzalez> So other than docs, do we have people interested in content?
[09:41:00] <ajpiano> yes
[09:41:20] <scott_gonzalez> Learn style content or like content for jqueryui.com?
[09:41:49] <ajpiano> seemeed like learn style, but we didnt' really ask for jqueryui.com type people
[09:42:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so here's my thought.
[09:42:03] <ajpiano> we could probably meet that need though if we look
[09:42:12] <scott_gonzalez> I doubt we'll need 3 tables worth of people working on actual docs.
[09:42:24] <ajpiano> right, core ui mobile
[09:42:26] <ajpiano> seems like overkill
[09:42:33] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably consolidate docs tables to be cross-project.
[09:42:35] <ajpiano> that's why i wanted to consolidate a bit of those into sites etc
[09:42:47] <ajpiano> that could work too
[09:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> Rather than merge docs + testing to keep the table in the same project, just merge docs with docs and testing with testing.
[09:43:11] <ajpiano> Mobile/UI Docs would be a good consolidation
[09:43:28] <ajpiano> word up, that makes sense
[09:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> So that should free up at least two tables for you.
[09:43:45] <ajpiano> yep!
[09:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> 2 docs + 2 testing
[09:43:48] <ajpiano> that does the trick
[09:44:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's hard to tell where we'll be with sites by mid-October, but I hope we won't need two tables wroth of implementing design.
[09:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> Though I could definitely see two tables worth of expanding the sites.
[09:45:36] <scott_gonzalez> That's why I was asking what kind of people we had that were interested in sites.
[09:45:39] <ajpiano> yah, but i can see having people on themeroller, or adding new functionality ot plugins site, etc
[09:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> If we're getting overwhelmed with designers, I don't know that making more room for this is going to be beneficial.
[09:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> right
[09:46:02] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: not designers
[09:46:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:46:38] <ajpiano> once i start getitng confirmations, i can start slotting people in
[09:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure we'll have plenty of tasks for "general site work"
[09:46:46] <ajpiano> and figuring out where our cards are falling
[09:46:48] <ajpiano> exactly.
[09:47:13] <ajpiano> we're going to start figuring out what we want to have each table accomplish *before* the event so we should be able to have some clear punch lists
[09:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> I also have a few questions about the learn site.
[09:48:30] <ajpiano> and don't we all
[09:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:48:49] <ajpiano> there's kind of a log jam that i need to clear out
[09:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> Just about the metadata for the articles.
[09:48:59] <ajpiano> so that i can get people to a place where it can be productive
[09:49:04] <scott_gonzalez> Is attribution currently being used?
[09:49:05] <ajpiano> shoot
[09:49:21] <ajpiano> no, it's an artificat
[09:49:39] <ajpiano> it was mostly a way of denoting stuff that was originally from jqf but it might be unncessary
[09:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> What's editrequired?
[09:50:20] <ajpiano> uch, another vestige
[09:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> Same for status?
[09:50:38] <ajpiano> it was something we started trying to denote that cretain adopted blogposts etc needed some attention
[09:50:55] <ajpiano> yep
[09:51:11] <ajpiano> and i think the "github" field is going to go away in favour of a more automated solution that looks at the actual file history
[09:51:14] <ajpiano> and contribs
[09:51:29] <ajpiano> (which is the type of task that someone interested in 'site build" and "grunt" could do)
[09:51:33] <scott_gonzalez> I assume chapter and section in some of the dex files is just leftover also?
[09:51:38] <scott_gonzalez> Since they're not in all dex files.
[09:51:49] <ajpiano> yeah, they aren't going to be dex anymore either
[09:52:09] <ajpiano> i have like 75% of a refactor that eliminates nanoc done
[09:52:17] <ajpiano> but some logjams to clear up, like i said
[09:52:31] <ajpiano> which i'm going to start attending to either this week or next
[09:52:34] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, ok. I was about to do that :-P
[09:52:45] <scott_gonzalez> grunt-jquery-content now supports markdown.
[09:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'll remove it from my list.
[09:52:53] <ajpiano> ohhhh really
[09:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it looks like the learn site should actually be really easy to convert.
[09:53:20] <ajpiano> yeah, i did this thing with Wintersmith
[09:53:40] <scott_gonzalez> There's a lot of work going on in the build that can just move to WordPress.
[09:53:43] <ajpiano> i might look at just using grunt-jquery-content, when i revisit it
[09:53:46] <ajpiano> yep
[09:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> Like listing the child pages on the indexes.
[09:53:58] <ajpiano> yeah, i alreay have that switched over locally
[09:54:09] <ajpiano> to wordpress templates, etc
[09:54:36] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[09:54:43] <ajpiano> i was really rocking and rolling on it like 7 weeks ago, then a client project came in, then this summit stuff, and wow, now it's been 7 weeks
[09:55:20] <ajpiano> time flies when you are Having Funâ„¢
[09:55:25] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[10:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Can you commit to a branch so that people can see the progress?
[10:04:18] <ajpiano> i sort of can.  right now it's kind of a sew-the-patient-up-with-the-knife-inside situation.  i am in OK enough shape with event  stuff that i could theoreticalyl spend the rest of today getting it to a stopping/starting point
[10:04:56] <ajpiano> need to do a bit of housework first but yeah, i would like to .. pull out the knife ... so that i can get some other hands on deck
[10:05:20] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: assigning leads for all these tables and projects kind of made me realise how over extended a bunch of us are :p
[10:08:18] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you send the email to google?
[10:08:42] <timmywil> I want me my cdn
[10:12:40] <Od1n> hi
[10:13:30] <Od1n> there's a spam comment on http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/30/jquery-1-8-1-released/
[10:14:39] <ajpiano> Od1n: thanks - there *was* a spam comment there but now it's gone :)
[10:20:10] <Od1n> do you know why google CDN takes so much time to push 1.8.1?
[10:21:46] <timmywil> Od1n: they do it manually. We have no control over it.
[10:23:11] <timmywil> My guess is they'll get to it tomorrow, due to Labor Day
[11:20:10] <mikesherov> .
[11:20:10] <bot-t> (48 hours 20 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell mikesherov http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8545
[11:20:55] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez LOL
[11:21:10] <mikesherov> I suppose I'm the curator now for all DBR's
[12:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: yup
[12:17:50] <mikesherov> haha, do you have a keywords field in your trac?
[12:18:00] <mikesherov> Can you tag that as dbr?
[12:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> Does that field not show up for you?
[12:19:04] <mikesherov> I don't have the privs on UI
[12:19:12] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: while I have you, is IE10 in browserstack borked for you too?
[12:19:37] <scott_gonzalez> You should have privs now :-)
[12:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check IE10.
[12:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> I've been using IE7 and IE9 today without a problem.
[12:20:09] <mikesherov> I get start screen for IE10 but no browser
[12:20:27] <mikesherov> nice, thanks for the upgrade
[12:20:46] <mikesherov> I'm a connesiuer of fine dramatic bug reports
[12:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: IE10 just loaded for me.
[12:22:36] <mikesherov> k, there it goes
[12:24:28] <mikesherov> yeah, it's about 50% for me
[12:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov is not one with a bleeding heart for the dozens of people worldwide :-P
[12:27:50] <mikesherov> LOL
[12:28:16] <mikesherov> I mean, honestly, if you're optimizing your table designed flash site for safari 5 users, you're doing it wrong
[12:29:02] <scott_gonzalez> But how else am I supposed to build my splash page?
[12:32:31] <mikesherov> animated gifs?
[12:32:34] <mikesherov> blink tags?
[12:32:42] <scott_gonzalez> animated gifs inside blink tags?
[12:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> <center><blink><img src="under-construction.gif"></blink></center>
[12:33:30] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...maybe <marquee> instead of <center>...
[12:36:42] <mikesherov> yeah
[12:36:55] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yt?
[12:38:52] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I'm on a ticket closing binge, what's your opinion of this ticket? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8625
[12:38:59] <mikesherov> Read my comments
[12:39:06] <mikesherov> if you can, please :-)
[12:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...seems like John was able to reproduce with the original test case.
[12:40:46] <mikesherov> yes
[12:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> But without a test case today that reproduces, I'd say set it back to pending.
[12:40:58] <mikesherov> and not fix it, but report to the IE9 team
[12:41:12] <mikesherov> oh, and then let trac-o-bot take care of the dirty work?
[12:41:15] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[12:41:34] <mikesherov> I think that's what I'll do.
[12:41:59] <scott_gonzalez> It actually worked with that tabs + java applet ticket from years ago.
[12:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> I set it to pending and the guy replied immediately.
[12:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> I was shocked.
[12:43:36] <mikesherov> yeah, I guess that makes sense
[12:44:02] <mikesherov> sometimes I underestimate the goodness and willingness to help of others
[12:44:13] <mikesherov> a few months on the bug tracker will do that to you
[12:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it definitely makes you skeptical.
[14:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> haha, dbr from my UI extensions? https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-ui-extensions/issues/9
[17:31:08] <mikesherov> .
[19:17:26] <mikesherov> timmywil: around?
[19:34:48] <DaveMethvin> .
[20:32:53] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Do you know when google cdn is updated for jq 1.8.1 ?
[20:32:59] <Krinkle> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js
[20:33:09] <paul_irish> tomorrow.
[20:33:22] <Krinkle> ok
[20:42:36] <paul_irish> :)
[21:12:17] <Krinkle> Wikipedia and sissie sites now runs jq 1.8.1
