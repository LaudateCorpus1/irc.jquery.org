[10:41:38] <m_gol> gibson042: is anything preventing a new Sizzle release?
[10:42:06] <m_gol> gibson042: BrowserStack has updated their Edge versions to ones that work fine so this is the only blocker to move it to the main browser set
[10:42:08] <gibson042> not that I can think of
[10:42:20] <gibson042> woohoo
[10:42:24] <m_gol> well, that and markelog's huge patch. :)
[10:42:28] <m_gol> so that we can update Sizzle
[10:42:33] <m_gol> afterwards
[10:48:42] <m_gol> gibson042: or maybe I'll just move it; only one test fails and it's good to see results on every commit in major browsers
[10:49:32] <gibson042> no objection here
[10:49:34] <m_gol> k
[10:51:44] <m_gol> I just need to get someone from BrowserStack answer why they updated Edge in place, keeping the old, now inadequate version...
[10:51:56] <gibson042> what?
[10:52:05] <m_gol> this versioning is a mess tbh
[10:52:12] <m_gol> in user agent you have Edge/12.10240
[10:52:21] <m_gol> the thing after "12." is the Windows build number
[10:52:38] <gibson042> the extra dots don't make it into user agent?
[10:52:46] <gibson042> I remember seeing one with four or five components
[10:52:49] <m_gol> while if you go to the settings screen you'll see "Microsoft Edge "20.10240.16384.0"
[10:52:51] <gibson042> none of which were clear
[10:52:55] <gibson042> yeah, that's it
[10:53:09] <snover> at least they enabled session queuing so you don‚Äôt experience test failures just because you happen to request a VM but other sessions are already running
[10:53:25] <m_gol> the Spartan build had "Project Spartan 0.11.10074.0" in the settings screen and "Edge/12.0" in the user agent
[10:53:39] <m_gol> but that was before they decided to put the build number after "12."
[10:54:01] <m_gol> and Edge is available as "0.11" in BrowserStack, even though they updated the build to the latest, 10240
[10:54:22] <m_gol> snover: that sounds bad
[10:54:43] <m_gol> snover: our tests were passing, though (mostly)
[10:54:43] <snover> m_gol: what sounds bad?
[10:54:45] <gibson042> ugh
[10:55:10] <m_gol> snover: the failures you described. Where were they happening?
[10:55:40] <snover> oh, whenever you reach your VM limit. So like‚Ä¶someone submits a PR but you are in the middle of running your test suite already? well the PR will fail its tests
[10:55:58] <snover> just because BS would immediately fail the request to create another VM instead of waiting for resources to free up
[10:56:02] <m_gol> gibson042: I have an impression that now that I pointed it out to them they'll update the version in the API to "20.10240" and break many projects that have "0.11" hardcoded. :P Like QUnit
[10:57:05] <m_gol> snover: did you have this problem in general or just with Edge machines? When using karma-browserstack-launcher the workers were waiting correctly for me
[10:57:25] <snover> in general
[10:57:27] <gibson042> you don't think they'll leave 0.11 and just restore it?
[10:57:45] <m_gol> ah, no, QUnit uses edge_latest so it will work
[10:57:55] <snover> sure if you wanted to do polling to figure it out yourself you could do that
[10:57:58] <m_gol> gibson042: it was a pre-release, they rarely keep pre-release versions around
[10:58:17] <snover> or just catch the error and ignore it and try again and again and again until it works
[10:58:32] <snover> i don‚Äôt know which strategy that package takes but it‚Äôd have been one or the other
[10:58:49] <snover> anyway. my point is‚Ä¶ they actually fix things sometimes :)
[10:58:57] <m_gol> gibson042: iOS 8 simulator had a broken user agent so we couldn't use it in TestSwarm as it relies on it being correct. iOS 8.3 simulator fixed it; when I notified BrowserStack they just added 8.3 and removed 8.0, breaking some projects in the process, obviously
[10:59:01] <m_gol> jzaefferer hit it
[10:59:08] <m_gol> snover: ;)
[10:59:28] <gibson042> mmm
[11:05:15] <m_gol> gibson042: for other browsers they may just clone the VM, update the browser and save the snapshot; for Edge they have to update the entire OS; if they dropped the old pre-release Spartan version I doubt they'll restore it now.

[12:14:32] <iamdamannieeez> Hey i found a typo in the blogpost about Dojo
[12:14:57] <iamdamannieeez> can somebody fix that quickly?
[12:15:04] <iamdamannieeez> about Lo-Dash
[12:15:30] <iamdamannieeez> kborchers are you the one that written it?
[12:15:55] <arthurvr> .. and then he left
[12:16:02] <arthurvr> oh now I get it
[12:16:34] <arthurvr> ‚ÄùLo-Dash‚Äù should‚Äôve been ‚Äùlodash‚Äù
[12:16:38] <m_gol> yeah
[12:16:41] <arthurvr> was renamed a while ago
[12:17:12] <arthurvr> kborchers: can you fix that ^? :)
[12:18:17] <kborchers> i mean ... the release was approved by JDD ...
[12:18:52] <arthurvr> Ha, yeah, but still
[12:18:53] <arthurvr> lolz
[12:19:08] <kborchers> so i can fix the blog post but the the press release
[12:19:13] <kborchers> which is everywhere
[12:19:42] <arthurvr> oh, yeah, right.
[12:19:45] <arthurvr> no worries though
[12:19:53] <arthurvr> don‚Äôt think anyone will notice :p
[12:22:54] <iamdamannieeez> coz I writing article about the merger
[12:23:06] <iamdamannieeez> s/I/I'm/
[12:24:22] <iamdamannieeez> kborchers: will there be software merged together too or is this only a merger of the underlying foundations?
[12:24:58] <iamdamannieeez> and will the jquery team now become dojo foundation team members? merging the github orgs?
[12:25:02] <iamdamannieeez> or is this only about the money?
[12:26:06] <iamdamannieeez> will there be any merging of organisations structure like teams and the board?
[12:29:11] <kborchers> neither foundationn makes technical decisions for its projects so if they want to work together that's up to them but we will not dictate that at the foundation level
[12:30:03] <iamdamannieeez> so jquery foundation doesn't decide about jQuery and jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile et al?
[12:30:25] <iamdamannieeez> ok ty
[12:31:27] <snover> kborchers: no more press releases on the first of the month ok :P
[12:31:45] <kborchers> snover: why is that?
[12:31:56] <snover> ‚Äúgoogle google google. google. google! google google.‚Äù is my news feed today
[12:32:08] <kborchers> yeah ...
[12:32:24] <kborchers> i could care less about a logo but it gets clicks
[12:32:31] <kborchers> ugh
[12:32:48] <kborchers> couldn't care less ... i hate when people (including myself) say that wrong
[12:32:49] <kborchers> :)
[12:33:05] <snover> english is hard, don‚Äôt worry about it
[12:33:11] <kborchers> heh
[12:33:19] <snover> for all intensive purposes you did it correctly
[12:33:28] <kborchers> lol
[12:35:04] <iamdamannieeez> will dojo be renamed to something jQuery *?
[12:35:27] <iamdamannieeez> like jQuery UI, jQuery mobile, ..
[12:36:11] <snover> no
[12:36:27] <iamdamannieeez> noted thank you
[12:36:46] <snover> as the dojo foundation hosts many projects not called dojo, the jquery foundation hosts many projects not called jquery
[12:37:19] <iamdamannieeez> I don't quite get it but anyway the article is finished goes live this eve thank you very much you peoples
[12:37:25] <iamdamannieeez> bye
[12:37:45] <snover> it‚Äôs always good to be a journalist publishing news about things that they don‚Äôt understand, i think that lends itself to very high quality reporting‚Ä¶
[12:38:40] <kborchers> lol
[12:38:41] <kborchers> wow
[12:38:46] <arthurvr> I‚Äôm so looking forward to this one :/ :\
[12:39:35] <snover> headline: ‚Äújquery consumes dojo logo, renames itself alphabet‚Äù
[12:41:37] <snover> whatever guys. i thought that was funny.
[12:42:20] <arthurvr> haha :P
[12:47:44] <kborchers> :)

[20:29:59] <alturic> hey guys, i have a .hover function that fires when you hover over something (duh), and it works fine on pageload BUT, I also have a function that changes the .html of that container. Now the actual selector exits in the replaced .html but it doesn't fire after the .html replace... is that normal functionality?
[20:30:02] <alturic> So the actual .hover function that fires on the hovered button still exists in the replaced .html, but it no longer works once the .html replace would have replaced the html.
[20:30:04] <alturic> http://jsfiddle.net/bjra624f/ is a fiddle.
