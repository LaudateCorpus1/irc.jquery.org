[08:19:06] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14151 seems odd
[08:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> Good luck getting a fix in amplify though :-P
[08:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> Might be worth tracking down because amplify doesn't modify jQuery or Sizzle in any way.
[08:43:17] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez appears to be the #userdata element added to the page http://jsfiddle.net/BG5aT/14/
[08:43:57] <DaveMethvin> since it's *[type=xxx] that element is seen and it prob doesn't have a getAttribute?
[08:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> Probably.
[08:44:33] <scott_gonzalez> Behaviors are weird.
[08:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure what it does to the element.
[08:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's too bad we have to inject that div into the page.
[08:45:52] <DaveMethvin> typeof div.getAttribute === "unknown"
[08:46:02] <DaveMethvin> but i think that should be callable
[08:46:17] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...so do we need to guard against this?
[08:46:23] <scott_gonzalez> Or are we going to say this is out of scope?
[08:46:32] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a simple check could be added in 1.x.
[08:46:43] <DaveMethvin> i haven't figured out where it is throwing the error yet
[08:46:50] <DaveMethvin> just that the behavior code causes it
[08:47:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's not getAttribute directly, because I can call it
[08:48:11] <DaveMethvin> should a <div> be in the <head>?
[08:48:18] <scott_gonzalez> Not really.
[08:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> But it was to work around something stupid, I'm sure.
[08:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, they totally destroyed this repo by using a different build system.
