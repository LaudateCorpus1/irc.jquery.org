[07:12:39] <heatxsink> does anyone in here know how to make the menu button show up in an app targeted for honeycomb?
[08:46:37] <gnarf> JohnResig: yt?
[08:57:37] <JohnResig> gnarf: yep
[08:57:41] <JohnResig> almost meeting time!
[08:57:59] <gnarf> aye... I'm wondering what the next step to making api-2 -> master for jQuery color is
[08:58:13] <JohnResig> good question - let's touch base after the meeting
[08:58:17] <gnarf> k
[09:00:18] <JohnResig> jaubourg: meeting time!
[09:00:22] <JohnResig> rwaldron: meeting
[09:06:05] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:29:31] <gnarf> where does sizzle handle commas?
[09:46:42] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: heya
[09:47:08] <jaubourg> sorry about the meeting, I was deep-down in some php bug madness :/
[09:47:16] <jzaefferer> btw. seems like I have the same issue as Scott, I see the voting form on the report when expanding a ticket, but not on the ticket page itself
[09:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: hey
[09:47:45] <JohnResig> weird...
[09:47:55] <JohnResig> which ticket(s) do you see this on?
[09:48:13] <scott_gonzalez> ok, just checked another ticket and it's not working there either
[09:48:18] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9392
[09:48:29] <JohnResig> what browser are you guys in?
[09:48:35] <JohnResig> this is working for me in Firefox and Chrome
[09:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> Chrome dev, Firefox 4, Firefox 3.6
[09:48:57] <JohnResig> :-|
[09:49:43] <gnarf> he scott_gonzalez -- i just reduced that opera selector issue
[09:49:48] <gnarf> not sure what we can do about it :)
[09:49:49] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/Yxd5P/1/
[09:50:01] <gnarf> opera doesn't throw an error when the :selected is on the right side of a comma
[09:50:34] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr: ^^
[09:50:37] <gnarf> it does when its on the left side....
[09:50:43] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/Yxd5P/2/
[09:52:22] <miketaylr> gnarf: yeah, that's actually getting fixed right now
[09:52:31] <gnarf> docs#8468
[09:52:33] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[09:52:33] <bot-t> [#8468] Find by multiple selector return different value in Opera (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/8468
[09:52:36] <miketaylr> i reported it a while back and there's been a lot of activity this week on that bug
[09:53:24] <gnarf> thats a strange one :)
[09:53:33] <gnarf> so JohnResig --- jquery-color?
[09:54:21] <JohnResig> gnarf: yep
[09:55:01] <gnarf> I have a little bit of documentation sitting in http://oksoclap.com/jquery-color-api that I wanna bring over to the README.md
[09:55:07] <gnarf> but thats like my last "todo" in that code
[09:55:48] <gnarf> Just curious what we want to do about releasing the API-2 -- I wouldn't mind trying to garner some feedback via a RC or something
[09:56:13] <JohnResig> well, if it's an API change then we should do a beta first, at least
[09:56:34] <gnarf> JohnResig: there really isn't a "change" in the API, there is just now an API ;)
[09:56:39] <JohnResig> heh
[09:56:52] <JohnResig> maybe draft up a blog post then and we can put it on the jQuery blog?
[09:57:07] <gnarf> danheberden: you willing to help me with that? :)
[09:57:31] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: where are you looking for the vote button
[09:57:41] <JohnResig> it should be beneath the large yellow desription
[09:57:44] <JohnResig> *description
[09:58:03] <JohnResig> http://gyazo.com/dee8aadec0e9f0746e0c666693912a5e.png
[09:58:06] <gnarf> JohnResig: should we push the source / minified versions up to code.jquery.com too?
[09:58:07] <JohnResig> (same for you jzaefferer)
[09:58:17] <JohnResig> gnarf: probably, yeah
[09:59:18] <gnarf> JohnResig: should I branch the current master to "stable" and then pull api-2 into master?
[09:59:52] <JohnResig> gnarf: nah, just overwrite master
[10:00:18] <kswedberg> hey JohnResig: sorry I missed the mtg. was at physical therapy.
[10:00:58] <DaveMethvin> hey kswedberg
[10:01:05] <kswedberg> hey DaveMethvin
[10:01:22] <danheberden> gnarf, ya - i don't hink today though :/
[10:01:26] <DaveMethvin> we talked about putting the 1.7 docs into api.jquery.com early, tagged as beta, after we land new features
[10:01:28] <DaveMethvin> thoughts?
[10:01:55] <gnarf> danheberden: no problem... I' should have time this week whenever we can get to it
[10:02:17] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: fine with me — although we should also provide a link to jquery-git
[10:02:24] <gnarf> oh, should we call it "version 2" of color?
[10:02:24] <DaveMethvin> good idea
[10:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: I know, Adam showed me a screenshot before
[10:02:43] <danheberden> gnarf - ya, i think so; ride the existing fame and glory
[10:03:33] <danheberden> kswedberg how can we have both 1.7 and current exist but not confuse people?
[10:04:10] <kswedberg> danheberden: I see. so, you're talking about changes to existing methods?
[10:04:12] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: as long as the new stuff is tagged as 1.7 beta and is already present in -git i think it should be good
[10:04:37] <danheberden> kswedberg i haven't gotten through all the req's so i'm not sure on that
[10:04:40] <DaveMethvin> for changes to existing methods, hmmm, that might be harder
[10:04:54] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: know of a ticket for pubsub?
[10:05:27] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: doesn't look like we got one for the 1.7 go-round
[10:05:39] <danheberden> ?7547
[10:05:41] <bot-t> [#7547] Adding pub/sub into jQuery core? ( handle );) - http://jqbug.com/7547
[10:05:44] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: yeah, changes to existing methods is the tough part — because we don't want to flag an existing method as beta. only a signature. or whatever
[10:06:03] <jzaefferer> JohnResig: http://bassistance.de/i/2f1ec6.png
[10:06:09] <paul_irish> thx dan
[10:06:36] <danheberden> also, https://gist.github.com/961057
[10:06:40] <jzaefferer> maybe a problem of lack of edit rights in Trac?
[10:06:49] <danheberden> paul_irish ^
[10:07:23] <paul_irish> danheberden: yeah i just want it in the core api
[10:07:48] <danheberden> jzaefferer bumped up your privs
[10:07:54] <danheberden> try it now
[10:08:31] <danheberden> actually sequelpro just crashed so maybe it didn't save :/
[10:09:26] <jzaefferer> I see the new privs, but no voting form :o
[10:09:27] <danheberden> it saved
[10:09:43] <danheberden> sounds like you don't got the new .js?
[10:10:08] <danheberden> paul_irish ya, i think $.bind/$.trigger seem more core api-ish, but i'm sure tha'ts a big debate
[10:10:42] <DaveMethvin> danheberden, paul_irish: if we add pub/sub then I think we should ban use of bind/trigger on plain objects
[10:11:05] <danheberden> DaveMethvin that's exactly the goal of having it on $ - boaz finally got me to see his point on that
[10:11:41] <DaveMethvin> the other approach is to get bind/trigger to have minimal overhead on plain objs so there is no need for pub/sub
[10:11:53] <DaveMethvin> but i am not sure how well we can do that
[10:12:03] <danheberden> still seems messy
[10:12:10] <DaveMethvin> they ARE very similar so it seems a shame to have two different mechanisms
[10:12:20] <danheberden> (for a pubsub implementation)
[10:12:30] <danheberden> i donno - bind to a collection vs bind to jquery
[10:12:57] <danheberden> though the name pub/sub might be better suited than bind/trigger
[10:13:02] <danheberden> for that purpose
[10:14:12] <DaveMethvin> it's just that there are crazy semantics for dom events that don't make sense for simple pub/sub ... bubbling, event object with lots of irrelevant data, default actions, etc.
[10:16:37] <danheberden> which is why having a separate implementatoin makes sense, ya?
[10:16:56] <danheberden> instead of $( {} ).bind( 'something', fn )
[10:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> I can tell you that there are two reasons we implemented pub/sub in amplify
[10:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> 1) get rid of the event object
[10:17:35] <scott_gonzalez> 2) lots of people find $( non-DOMElement ) confusing
[10:17:37] <rwaldron> danheberden dont drink the koolaid
[10:17:45] <danheberden> rwaldron haha
[10:17:54] <rwaldron> i was once pro-"pub/sub" too
[10:18:09] <danheberden> "welcome to pub/sub anonymous"
[10:18:36] <rwaldron> i need to go grab lunch
[10:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'm -1 on pub/sub in jQuery
[10:18:41] <rwaldron> back in a few
[10:18:54] <danheberden> i just think if people are wanting pub/sub, having  a small implementation on $ makes sense - definitely wrt: scott_gonzalez point #2
[10:19:00] <danheberden> rwaldron looking forward to the koolaid talk
[10:19:08] <rwaldron> danheberden people dont know what they want
[10:19:21] <DaveMethvin> i'm not against pub/sub, but am not sure it belongs in my jQuery back yard
[10:19:29] <DaveMethvin> we don't need it in core atm
[10:19:30] <rwaldron> they _heard_ a few devs talking about it and the term "pub/sub" is fun to say
[10:19:39] <jaubourg> implementing pub/sub with $.Callbacks would be trivial
[10:19:41] <DaveMethvin> unlike events
[10:19:42] <rwaldron> and all of a sudden its a trending topic on twitter
[10:20:01] <rwaldron> I'm interested in what jaubourg is cookin' up
[10:20:11] <rwaldron> he has an uncanny ability to deliver us free shit
[10:20:18] <DaveMethvin> i can hear gzip groaning already :P
[10:20:29] <rwaldron> fix deferreds? oh, here's pub/sub for free
[10:20:37] <rwaldron> anyway, food time
[10:20:37] <danheberden> haha
[10:20:44] <rwaldron> <3 jaubourg
[10:20:50] <jaubourg> well, I need a more generic callbacks list for progress on deferred
[10:21:04] <jaubourg> and progress callbacks... well they are like pub sub with a small variant
[10:21:10] <jaubourg> so heh
[10:21:42] <rwaldron> jaubourg as long as you can give them "topics" or "labels", then you're in business
[10:21:47] <rwaldron> ok food for real now
[10:22:31] <jaubourg> heh, gotta go to an RPG session
[10:23:02] <jaubourg> I can hack a pub/sub imp in the 1.7/callbacks branch when I get back
[10:23:35] <jaubourg> bbl fellows
[10:24:53] <jzaefferer> btw. in regards to jQuery filesize, this post is quite interesting: http://blog.bolinfest.com/2011/04/jquerycom-uses-only-34-of-jquery.html - in that it suggest to just use Closure Compiler in Advanced Mode to get rid of the code you don't use
[10:25:33] <jzaefferer> I haven't really seen that advocated anywhere in reply to "jQuery is too big"
[10:26:12] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: how can you be sure you've exercised all the code paths though?
[10:26:22] <DaveMethvin> i am assuming it looks at dynamic calls
[10:26:39] <ajpiano> also, doesn't jQuery not support advanced_optimizations
[10:26:53] <jzaefferer> I don't know how advanced mode actually works
[10:27:06] <DaveMethvin> they talk about "mousing around" so I assume you'd have to try everything on the page and even then there could be code paths not exercised
[10:27:08] <ajpiano> i am kind of really suspicious of this metric
[10:27:14] <jzaefferer> ajpiano, there's some guy working on closure compiler who maintains a externs file for jQuery Core
[10:27:27] <ajpiano> oh?
[10:28:28] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin, that's not how Closure Compiler works, so that part doesn't matter that much
[10:28:38] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/5885
[10:28:55] <jzaefferer> among other links in there: http://blogs.missouristate.edu/web/2011/02/14/jquery-plugins-and-closure-compiler/
[10:29:56] <jzaefferer> not actually what I wanted to link to
[10:29:57] <jzaefferer> http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/contrib/externs/jquery-1.5.js
[10:30:42] <ajpiano> ?7318
[10:30:43] <bot-t> [#7318] Support Closure Compiler ADVANCED,OPTIMIZATIONS (closed feature: wontfix) - http://jqbug.com/7318
[10:30:45] <jzaefferer> there's quite some overhead for that type of optimization, but if its already done for 1.5 at least..
[10:31:15] <ajpiano> seems like, we couldn't use it to minify jquery - just end users of the lib could, if they wanted to
[10:32:06] <jzaefferer> yep, but that's okay
[10:32:26] <jzaefferer> not just okay, that's the point of advanced mode
[10:32:33] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:32:49] <DaveMethvin> although i'd expect if we don't use it, the feature may not end up being well tested
[10:32:55] <DaveMethvin> and it works differently for each user
[10:33:06] <DaveMethvin> so there's a lot of potential error there
[10:34:17] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez, jzaefferer: Just a reminder that you don't actually need the voting tool on the individual ticket pages, it's good enough to just reply with a comment that says "+1, Let's do it." or similar.
[10:34:26] <JohnResig> just make sure you start the comment with +1 or -1 or +0
[10:34:37] <ajpiano> is there no way to run jquery through closure with advaned_optimsizations without the externs file, jzaefferer ?
[10:34:44] <JohnResig> jzaefferer: I've been advocating for using Closure Compiler
[10:35:14] <DaveMethvin> it needs the externs file to know what it can't rename, right?
[10:35:30] <jzaefferer> JohnResig: haven't seen you advocating it :-)
[10:35:41] <JohnResig> ajpiano: it would be good to know what gets stripped out even if it's used
[10:35:54] <JohnResig> I wonder if there's anyway to programmatically determine that
[10:36:07] <gnarf> so, when pulling this big change from api-2 -> master -- should i -no-ff or -squash or any of that funkiness? :)
[10:36:26] <JohnResig> gnarf: nah, just do a regular merge
[10:37:25] <JohnResig> won't that externs file make it so that none of those items are compressed/removed?
[10:39:24] <jzaefferer> JohnResig, dunno, I could try to contact that guy who did the tooltip blog post and see if he'd be interested in working with us so that new releases could provide that externs file
[10:39:47] <jzaefferer> updating it for a new release should be quite trivial, testing would require good knowledge of how that all actually works
[10:43:22] <ajpiano> i like the idea of us having the externs file around to allow people to use CC if they would like
[10:43:34] <ajpiano> jzaefferer, you should definitely do that ;)
[10:43:58] <timmywil> .
[10:44:53] <jzaefferer> will do
[10:45:25] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color -- README updated with general API documentation
[10:51:57] <danheberden> gnarf :D
[10:55:00] <AaronDCampbell> Are older versions of jQuery UI (like 1.8.9) easily available somewhere?
[10:55:26] <danheberden> ?g google api jquery
[10:55:28] <bot-t> danheberden, Google Libraries API - Developer's Guide - Google Libraries API ... - http://code.google.com/apis/libraries/devguide.html
[10:55:40] <danheberden> just replace 1.8.13 with whatever version you want
[10:55:57] <danheberden> AaronDCampbell ^
[10:56:10] <timmywil> AaronDCampbell: the blog has full lists of what's on the cdn -- http://blog.jqueryui.com/
[10:56:54] <AaronDCampbell> danheberden: The thing is...I just need the accordion bit from 1.8.9
[10:57:15] <AaronDCampbell> I can copy/paste from the non-minified version...just means I need to build my own minified one
[10:57:35] <AaronDCampbell> Or try to figure out where accordion starts/stops in the minified version...but that's a pain
[10:57:37] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell: i pasted you the minifed 1.8.9 accordion in #jquery, but also, you can get the developer pacakge for 1.8.9 from the blog
[10:58:06] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell: http://jquery-ui.googlecode.com/files/jquery-ui-1.8.9.zip
[10:58:37] <ajpiano> AaronDCampbell: if you have an editor that lets you jump between matching parens, it's not that bad
[10:59:01] <AaronDCampbell> thanks
[11:03:47] <jzaefferer> ajpiano, JohnResig, DaveMethvin: the video quality sucks, but it gives a good overview of what is involved in using advanced mode, skip ahead to 10:30: http://blogs.missouristate.edu/web/2011/03/26/1671/
[11:06:28] <jzaefferer> also an interesting tidbit, from the UI ticket I linked to earlier: "I also use/reference the jQuery 1.5 externs: http://closure-compiler.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/contrib/externs/jquery-1.5.js. While I realize that UI still depends upon jQuery 1.4.4, the externs for 1.5 are much more accurate as I refine the generation program with every new release."
[11:06:36] <jzaefferer> so he actually got some generator for that externs file
[11:26:23] <ajpiano> that's clever
[11:26:36] <ajpiano> this could be a good side-feature for 1.7

[17:01:28] <jaubourg> subscribe
[17:05:22] <jaubourg> rwaldron: if you're curious look up ^^
[17:28:49] <timmywil> jaubourg: docs#9408  am i crazy in thinking that's not a valid request?
[17:28:50] <bot-t> jaubourg, [#9408] Ajax syncronously success function problem (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/9408
[17:29:19] <timmywil> can't really make cross-domain requests synchronous is what I'm thinking
[17:29:34] <timmywil> not that I see any point in doing that anyway
[17:35:34] <jaubourg> you're correct timmy and this is documented actually
[17:36:08] <timmywil> Ah, shoulda checked
[17:36:49] <timmywil> thanks jaubourg
[17:38:35] <jaubourg> np ;)
[17:39:15] <gnarf> jaubourg: dunno if you noticed, but i responsed to the proposal of mine you -1'ed ;)
[17:41:44] <gnarf> http://jqbug.com/8921
[17:42:20] <gnarf> or that was timmywil
[17:42:21] <jaubourg> I +1ed it :P
[17:42:34] <gnarf> http://jqbug.com/8498
[17:42:53] <gnarf> ^^ that one was you
[17:43:59] <jaubourg> yeah, I would map it no matter what really
[17:44:14] <jaubourg> I hate the idea of having css mapping done in effects
[17:44:35] <gnarf> well .css("margin", 10) is a bit different then .css({ marginTop: 10, marginLeft: 10, marginRight: 10, marginBottom: 10 });
[17:44:40] <timmywil> it's a css mapping for the sake of effects
[17:44:50] <timmywil> shouldn't be done for css
[17:44:51] <gnarf> its only really needed for animate purpose
[17:45:05] <gnarf> shorthand property map?
[17:45:07] <gnarf> i dunno
[17:45:21] <timmywil> but I see the point
[17:45:55] <timmywil> perhaps an effects specific property on cssProps
[17:46:07] <jaubourg> is the gain in not mapping for pure css worth putting definitions all around or specialize hooks? My opinion is no
[17:46:19] <gnarf> however we map it, the point was we need to map it...
[17:46:23] <jaubourg> but that's just my opinion, really
[17:47:28] <gnarf> i actually think it should probably be on cssHooks
[17:47:38] <jaubourg> but yes, we do need to map it, I hate the idea that animating doesn't support margin
[17:47:53] <gnarf> it supports margin if you had all margins set equal
[17:47:54] <gnarf> :)
[17:48:00] <gnarf> otherwise it gets top (i think)
[17:48:04] <timmywil> well, animateHooks is really a different idea than animateProps.  I think animateHooks could be useful, but I see the argument against animateProps since they are css properties.
[17:49:10] <gnarf> if we were to make the map functinos a little smarter
[17:49:18] <gnarf> like allowing margin: "10px 100px"
[17:49:28] <jaubourg> heh
[17:49:30] <gnarf> that could be cool too
[17:49:35] <jaubourg> instant gain
[17:49:45] <gnarf> not for .css() tho
[17:49:51] <gnarf> because again, the browser takes care of it for us
[17:50:08] <jaubourg> what's the exact performance gain of not doing it for css?
[17:50:15] <jaubourg> I'd say marginal
[17:50:33] <timmywil> there's just not a lot of point in adding
[17:50:41] <gnarf> entirely unneeded lines of code
[17:50:50] <timmywil> it would take extra code for it to work
[17:50:55] <timmywil> in css
[17:51:21] <jaubourg> how so?
[17:51:40] <gnarf> the only time we need to know what each of those expanded properties resolves to is when we need to do something per property (like animate)
[17:51:40] <jaubourg> it's not different than how we map opacity is it?
[17:51:51] <gnarf> jaubourg: yes, its quite different
[17:51:52] <timmywil> jaubourg: it is
[17:52:00] <jaubourg> (mind you I haven't looked deeply into cssHooks)
[17:52:03] <gnarf> the opacity is a get/set map
[17:52:25] <gnarf> the proposed map actually returns a new object which needs to be merged with the original object
[17:52:32] <gnarf> for properties
[17:52:40] <gnarf> then in .css() you'd have to worry about string key too
[17:52:50] <gnarf> .css("margin", 10) vs .css({margin: 10})
[17:53:55] <jaubourg> I see your point
[17:54:07] <jaubourg> let me look into cssHooks
[17:55:18] <gnarf> jaubourg: also, since the browser does automatically expand those properties the way it should automatically, .css("margin", 10) already does what it wants, any characters we add to .css() to support the mappers is just wasted bytes IMO
[17:55:33] <gnarf> one too many automaticallies in that sentance
[17:55:37] <gnarf> but you got the point im sure
[17:55:38] <gnarf> :)
[17:56:08] <jaubourg> yeah, well, if we had a browser with a bug regarding said expansion, we would handle it, wouldn't we?
[17:56:36] <jaubourg> my point is, it's css-related, not effects-related
[17:56:49] <gnarf> jaubourg: true - but if the browser bugged on that, thats some serious issues ;)
[17:56:59] <timmywil> jaubourg: it's debatable ;)
[17:57:05] <gnarf> jaubourg: effects are inherently css related though
[17:57:17] <jaubourg> gnarf: could happen in some weird document constructs and would be simpler to handle by always expanding
[17:57:24] <gnarf> because we are animating css properties...
[17:57:49] <jaubourg> yes, but my point is: CSS "definitions"/behaviour === css module
[17:58:18] <gnarf> jaubourg: and I'd be willing to refactor the "property parser" logic into css.js
[17:58:23] <gnarf> it makes more sense there
[17:58:40] <jaubourg> I know I'm stubborn with these things but having CSS expansion handled in effects.js sounds like a bad patch to me
[17:58:43] <gnarf> might even be able to DRY out some of the prop handling between .css() and .animate()
[17:58:49] <jaubourg> heh
[17:58:54] <jaubourg> DRY away my friend :)
[18:04:31] <gnarf> imma go kill some shit in DDO
[18:04:49] <gnarf> thanks for listening to my counterpoints ;)
[18:07:54] <jaubourg> thanks for making them... that's why I love to work on this project so much :)
[23:48:16] <gnarf> I don't wanna close this yet
[23:48:23] <gnarf> but docs#9381 seems like a wontfix to me
[23:48:28] <bot-t> [#9381] setTimeout and fadeIn/fadeOut blocking in Chrome (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9381
[23:48:37] <gnarf> rwaldron: ^^^^
[23:54:05] <gnarf> same with docs#8515
[23:54:06] <bot-t> [#8515] Animate hiding contained borders (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/8515
[23:54:22] <gnarf> i leave them to someone who feels more authority to kill requests than I do ;)
