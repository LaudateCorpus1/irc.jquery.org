[07:28:43] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer Krinkle|detached The error with getting back an html error page rather than JSON is browserstack's? Or is it us? Just wanted to be sure before i send them a message.

[11:37:30] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 are you seeing a fail in the event unit test for onbeforeunload?
[11:37:54] <DaveMethvin> it seems due to qunit 1.11 but i don't see any obvious changes in qunit that would cause it
[11:45:47] <DaveMethvin> hey orkel are you seeing a fail in the event unit tests for 1.9-stable and master?
[11:45:55] <DaveMethvin> it's the onbeforeunload test
[11:46:09] <DaveMethvin> i can make it go away if i back out the qunit 1.11 upgrade

[13:36:37] <DaveMethvin> dear swarmy: Project jQuery 1.x Core build #59: HASN'T FINISHED
[13:41:25] <JeyKeu> Higuys I'vejust requested a commit which will create a composer config file allowing composer users to fetch jquery js file
[13:42:05] <JeyKeu> how much time does it take to approve/dissapprove the commit?
[13:44:34] <ajpiano> hi JeyKeu
[13:44:36] <ajpiano> what is composer :p
[13:44:57] <ajpiano> http://getcomposer.org/
[13:44:57] <ajpiano> ?
[13:45:20] <JeyKeu> its much like npm but for php projects
[13:45:35] <ajpiano> right
[13:45:36] <JeyKeu> yea,
[13:45:52] <ajpiano> i wonder if we should do it
[13:46:04] <JeyKeu> why not?
[13:46:58] <ajpiano> there are a lot of different package managers we could forseeably add
[13:47:12] <ajpiano> interesting that the bower shim for loading jquery ships with a composer.json
[13:47:20] <ajpiano> https://github.com/components/jquery
[13:49:38] <JeyKeu> some guy/company kracksoft has forked 1.8.2 version of jquery and uploaded a composer packege library, packagist
[13:50:07] <JeyKeu> so i thought it woud be better to make the actual thing 
[13:50:14] <JeyKeu> put*
[13:50:47] <ajpiano> do you have a link to that one
[13:50:53] <JeyKeu> https://packagist.org/
[13:51:00] <JeyKeu> https://github.com/kraksoft/jquery
[13:51:16] <ajpiano> right
[13:51:37] <ajpiano> so the thing is it looks like composer needs a built jQuery
[13:51:38] <ajpiano> to refer to
[13:51:52] <ajpiano> there is no jquery.js in https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[13:54:54] <JeyKeu> I'm not currently sure how composer grabs the files, but you have the release.js.
[13:55:10] <JeyKeu> and yea,
[13:56:47] <JeyKeu> on packagist, when submit  a package is clicked, it asks for the repo url
[13:57:57] <DaveMethvin> JeyKeu: so does it want the repo without a built file?
[13:58:04] <DaveMethvin> and it's going to pull down and build the file?
[13:58:14] <DaveMethvin> I would not recommend people run a jquery built that way
[13:58:29] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15rwldrn opened pull request #1160: Rewrite data to use a valueOf-override keying system (06master...06data-optimized)  02http://git.io/3dY7kQ
[13:58:57] <JeyKeu> yea, i gues, it  initially looks for the json file
[13:59:06] <DaveMethvin> we don't  have a built file in our repo
[13:59:08] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin PR up
[13:59:12] <DaveMethvin> thanks rwaldron
[13:59:16] <JeyKeu> the recommend github hooks
[13:59:25] <JeyKeu> they*
[13:59:54] <DaveMethvin> we have a CDN full of built files at http://code.jquery.com
[14:00:29] <DaveMethvin> if someone wants a built copy of jquery that's not bleeding edge, that's where they would get it
[14:00:51] <JeyKeu> so how to go about it
[14:01:01] <DaveMethvin> i don't know, it's YOUR pull request :D
[14:02:24] <JeyKeu> :)
[14:02:52] <JeyKeu> ok let me do some "experiment" on a foked repo
[14:03:04] <DaveMethvin> ok, that's a good idea
[14:03:08] <JeyKeu> bear with me plz
[14:03:10] <JeyKeu> thx
[14:04:51] <DaveMethvin> JeyKeu: https://github.com/composer/composer/issues/946
[14:04:52] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Issue #946 by disposable-ksa98 (6mon 1w 3d 17h 23m 36s): Add dist type file for packages that are single plain text files.
[14:07:43] <JeyKeu> i downloaded jquery from https://github.com/kraksoft/jquery repo via composer and the type mentioned in the json file is "library"
[14:09:11] <JeyKeu> have look in the file plz, but there is no dist property/object there
[14:11:52] <DaveMethvin> JeyKeu: i am just saying it doesn't seem like putting this file in the jquery repo solves any problem by itself, if you think it does please change your fork and demonstrate how it works
[14:24:35] <DaveMethvin> um, swarmy, I demand an apology: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2528

[18:01:08] <sayd> is there a place i could point my architects to for 2.0 roadmap?
[18:03:11] <gf3> *ahem*
[18:04:09] <snover> something stuck in your throat gf3?
[18:16:24] <DaveMethvin> sayd: API-wise, 1.9 and 2.0 are the same
[18:17:01] <DaveMethvin> so if you upgrade to 1.9 there shouldn't be much problem moving to 2.0 if you want
[18:17:16] <DaveMethvin> but i would suggest 1.9 for most web pages, and 2.0 for non-web use
[22:37:46] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin|away: you sure you want migrate on google CDN? to me makes more sense to keep it on one server instead of fragmenting possible cache hits
[22:37:52] <paul_irish> dont know if Bryan agrees with me though
[22:38:08] <paul_irish> i'm not gonna say no, though.. if you want it on and Bryan says oK
