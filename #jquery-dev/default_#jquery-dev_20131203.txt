[07:24:51] <markelog> timmywil: you there?
[07:25:04] <timmywil> yo
[07:25:21] <markelog> https://github.com/timmywil/grunt-bowercopy
[07:25:40] <markelog> is it what i think it is?
[07:26:09] <timmywil> I'm not sure. What do you think it is? :)
[07:26:45] <markelog> analogue of grunt-bower-task?
[07:27:18] <timmywil> certainly similar, but slightly different approach
[07:27:48] <timmywil> I prefer to have meticulous control over where specific files from bower components are placed
[07:28:15] <timmywil> so bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.js -> js/libs/jquery.js and so on
[07:28:28] <markelog> it looks better then grunt-bower-task, could we use it in jQuery Core?
[07:29:22] <timmywil> Absolutely. I was going to ask the core team's opinion to see if it would be preferred.
[07:29:49] <markelog> you got my vote :-)
[07:30:14] <timmywil> cool :D
[07:31:28] <markelog> i would like to make a PR with your task, i think we could discuss it there
[07:32:07] <timmywil> certainly
[07:32:12] <markelog> or you wanted to do it yourself?
[07:34:03] <timmywil> oh no, feel free! I'd appreciate the help. I'm working on integrating scott_gonzalez's build script today.
[07:34:24] <markelog> okay, great
[08:23:35] <markelog> timmywil: it looks like i can't copy folders right?
[08:26:35] <timmywil> markelog: hmm, I haven't considered that. It just uses grunt.file.copy
[08:27:19] <markelog> yeah, i can send a PR about it
[08:28:01] <timmywil> markelog: awesome, thanks!
