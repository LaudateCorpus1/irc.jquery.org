[06:53:08] <matjas> http://jsperf.com/ready $().ready(fn) > $(document).ready(fn) > $(fn)
[07:04:01] <jzaefferer> those numbers look like it doesn't matter at all what you use, as you'll have only up to a dozen, if even more then one
[07:10:16] <timmywil> matjas: require.ready >
[07:10:37] <timmywil> :P
[07:14:32] <matjas> jzaefferer: sure, yet still i was kinda surprised that $(doc).ready(fn) is faster than just $(fn)
[07:14:51] <matjas> itâ€™s an extra function call so it *seems* slower when you look at it
[07:15:07] <matjas> but i guess internally $(fn) is slightly heavier
[07:15:14] * matjas sticks with $(fn) anyhow
[09:07:55] <ben_alman> rworth, there?
[09:09:34] <rworth> ben_alman: what's up?
[09:10:02] <ben_alman> what about adding a "prettyname" field
[09:10:15] <ben_alman> a lot of people would like to see "jQuery History" instead of just history
[09:10:22] <ben_alman> or "jQuery BBQ" instead of bbq
[09:10:28] <ben_alman> at the top of the page
[09:10:56] <ben_alman> it could be added into the description but then it would be weird
[09:10:59] <ben_alman> then the title would be like
[09:11:10] <ben_alman> "jQuery BBQ: The full title of this plugin is also in super huge text"
[09:11:26] <ben_alman> "jQuery Random Element: Filter the current set down to a single random element."
[09:11:29] <ben_alman> etc
[09:11:34] <ajpiano> ben_alman, rworth and i are on a call atm
[09:11:35] <rworth> so I looked at the definition of "main"
[09:11:42] <ajpiano> let's discuss after
[09:11:47] <ben_alman> it can wait until after the call or after lunch
[09:11:48] <ben_alman> np
[09:11:50] <rworth> ok
[09:11:54] <ben_alman> we can get on skype then if it works for y'all
[09:12:15] <rworth> I need to call boaz after this call, but let's get on after that
[09:12:25] <ben_alman> sure
[09:29:06] <rworth> ben_alman: you on skype?
[09:32:18] <ben_alman> sec
[10:29:42] <DaveMethvin> .
[11:59:28] <ajpiano> rworth: you said you posted a package.json to the wiki somewhere? can you send a link
[12:00:17] <rworth> not to the wiki, to the github repo https://github.com/jquery/jquery-plugins/blob/master/docs/json.md
[12:00:46] <rworth> I have not yet created a package.json, only the spec (based on npm's)
[12:01:59] <ajpiano> aha
[14:37:42] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://bit.ly/jaRLpG
[14:37:42] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Landing pull request 413. Move border/padding checks to after width validation to avoid unnecessary fallbacks. Fixes #9598.... - Mike Sherov
[14:45:24] <timmywil> that should probably say to avoid unnecessary border/padding checks
[14:45:31] <timmywil> oops
[14:51:24] <gnarf> too bad it is forever vauge in history
[14:52:00] <timmywil> nooooo!
[15:22:26] <jaubourg> hello there
[15:22:35] <gnarf> hey there sexy
[15:22:43] <gnarf> some guy was just offering $15 to fix his ajax problem
[15:22:50] <gnarf> :)
[15:23:06] <gnarf> in #jquery .... gotta love it
[15:23:46] <jaubourg> haha
[16:07:19] <gnarf> has the 1.7 roadmap been finalized?
[16:07:35] <gnarf> like did everyone vote / is stuff still open being considered?
[16:08:21] <gnarf> just curious if i should start digging into my 1.7 stuff
[16:08:50] <jaubourg> I think things that are still open have been selected
[16:09:10] <jaubourg> some require inspection of proposed patch but that's about it
[16:09:25] <gnarf> coo
[16:09:37] <gnarf> i'll try to put some pulls together
[16:12:10] <gnarf> recently updated https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/367 btw
[16:12:16] <gnarf> someone caught a bug
[23:57:20] <alystair> is there any way to modify the variable inside step function during animation?
[23:58:05] <alystair> I tried changing the 'now' value during a step but it just seems to be for reference, also tried changing the actual property being animated directly inside step but it also gets ignored or overwritten
[23:58:23] <alystair> just curious how to change the animation in progress properly
[23:59:15] <gnarf> alystair: stop it and start a new one :/
[23:59:39] <alystair> gnarf: but I'd be changing it in every step because I'm doing some silly physics :S
