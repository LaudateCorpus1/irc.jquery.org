[08:58:09] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: we could just if ( style.removeAttribute ) as the original ticket suggests, and this seems to be biting people in various unit testing suites

[11:08:10] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: sorry I missed the meeting. helped someone move over lunch
[11:08:21] <timmywil> I saw the logs tho
[11:10:07] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: cool
[11:10:15] <DaveMethvin> i think we're in good shape
[11:11:04] <DaveMethvin> oh i meant to ask about this one timmywil http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12201
[11:12:34] <timmywil> yea I saw that. I'm not sure what to do there. Creating custom pseudos with arguments is different. The previous way was certainly ugly, but if there are enough people making custom pseudos with arguments, it could be an issue.
[11:16:26] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I don't think the API for creating custom selectors is documented anywhere but Sizzle. Is that right?
[11:16:42] <DaveMethvin> haha i was just looking that up, yeah
[11:17:07] <DaveMethvin> there were a few old blog posts from various places i think, still trying to find them
[11:18:32] <DaveMethvin> malsup's stuff is unaffected, it doesn't describe the other args: http://www.malsup.com/jquery/expr/
[11:30:17] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11624345/getting-the-match-object-in-a-custom-filter-selector-in-jquery-1-8
[11:52:14] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I posted an answer. we'll see the reaction.
[12:32:44] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: nice agenda! "Ship? Fuck yes!"
[12:33:40] <DaveMethvin> Shipping is its own statement, jzaefferer :)
[12:34:16] <DaveMethvin> it'll take me a day just to do the blog post for the release
[12:34:55] <jzaefferer> ya well. Scott worked a week or so on the 1.9 upgrade guide /o\
[12:35:10] <jzaefferer> but then we also spend two years and a half on that..
[19:51:54] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: do  you have the link to that jsfiddle you did using promises and progress callbacks?
[19:52:11] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to use it in the blog post as an example
