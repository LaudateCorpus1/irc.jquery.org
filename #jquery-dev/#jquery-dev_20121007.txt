[06:27:37] <mbutubuntu> hello folks, I'm reading jquery sources and I've a question about core.js line #62. Why the fcamelCase function returns (letter + "").toUpperCase() and not simply letter.toUpperCase() ?
[06:28:35] <mbutubuntu> I've tried to search the commit about that line but github seems not to be able to show commits by line...
