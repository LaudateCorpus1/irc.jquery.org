[05:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: done
[05:43:59] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, wrong issue...
[12:15:09] <johnbender> gnarf: I totally lied to you about being online this morning :(
[12:15:17] <johnbender> I slept in and I have a much earlier flight than I thought
[12:15:26] <johnbender> really sorry
[12:15:28] <gnarf> johnbender: no probs
[12:15:31] <gnarf> johnbender: i wasn't ready anyway
[12:15:43] <gnarf> johnbender: we have until monday tho
[12:16:10] <gnarf> i should have the *.jquerymobile.com services up on eol2 within the next hours
[12:16:31] <gnarf> if you could jump back after your flight/travel wears down and just help verify things are working
[13:46:47] <scott_gonzalez> How did we get so big with so much scrutiny over the bytes? http://groups.drupal.org/node/665#comment-1889 :-P
[13:56:31] <ajpiano> it's ironic in light of their recent decisions
[13:56:32] <ajpiano> lol
[14:01:31] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: They will actually continue to use jQuery.
[14:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> I was just talking to them about 1.9/2.0 yesterday.
[14:02:21] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: did the conversation in that thread shift dramatically? or did they just decide not to do that
[14:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't really followed that thread, but I assume they realized it was crazy talk.
[14:24:58] <rwaldron> I like john's avatar in that thread.
[14:31:08] <gnarf> rwaldron: Agree
[14:43:46] <dme> Krinkle: If I have a question about trying to get your automation part of testswarm working, would here be a good place to ask, or is there better place to do so?
[14:45:25] <Krinkle> here is good
[14:45:42] <Krinkle> dme: got a public link? where are you working. what's the progress so far?
[14:46:40] <dme> Cool. I'm right now trying to get the Jenkins integration worked out and am getting an error that I have no idea what to do with on the "grunt --no-color" command
[14:47:29] <Krinkle> Do you know what grunt is?
[14:48:14] <dme> Not really. At least not anymore that what the readme says
[14:49:03] <gnarf> clarkbox: you around?
[14:49:32] <dme> I can link you to the testswarm, but this really doesn't have to do with that. I'm honestly not sure what my problem is, but figured I have to ask somewhere.
[14:52:06] <dme> on the build console, Jenkins shows me: [workspace] $ /bin/sh -xe /tmp/hudson<long number>.sh and then later says that the .sh file can't be found
[14:52:44] <dme> the numbers are different for each build (not really sure what meaning they have, if anything other than a file marker)
[14:54:03] <dme> I have taken a look at jQuery's grunt file for node testswarm and copied the testswarm registerTask section into there
[14:54:18] <dme> making changes from jQuery's info, of course
[14:54:38] <Krinkle> dme: if you don't know what grunt is and/or if you wouldn't know why you would need it in your repository, just don't use it and skip that step
[14:55:03] <Krinkle> dme: you need to actually install grunt for that to work
[14:55:07] <Krinkle> just leave it out
[14:55:21] <Krinkle> if you're interested in it later, you could check it out at a later time
[14:56:03] <dme> Ok. That sounds nice and painless. I'll see what happens :)
[14:59:41] <dme> Krinkle: So I'm clear, I'll instead need to write the file which adds jobs to testswarm, correct? I have a test one working right now, but it can only successfully add one job at a time
[15:00:19] <dme> although I'm sure that can be changed (I really haven't put much time into it, just threw some things together)
[15:00:23] <Krinkle> Oh, that's right. The submission to testswarm is done from within grunt\
[15:00:23] <Krinkle> 
[15:00:38] <Krinkle> yeah, trying to do that in another way could work but not worth it imho.
[15:01:11] <Krinkle> Do you have npm installed?
[15:01:19] <dme> yes
[15:01:21] <Krinkle> So you can add grunt to your devDependencies
[15:01:24] <Krinkle> and node-testswarm
[15:01:32] <dme> mmk
[15:01:40] <Krinkle> that's what jquery has
[15:03:35] <Krinkle>   "devDependencies": {
[15:03:35] <Krinkle>     "grunt-compare-size": ">=0.1.0",
[15:03:36] <Krinkle>     "grunt": "~0.3.9",
[15:03:37] <Krinkle>     "testswarm": "0.2.2"
[15:03:41] <Krinkle> ignore the grunt-compare-size
[15:03:58] <Krinkle> as in, don't include it
[15:04:48] <Krinkle> dme: the jquery one is very big and contains lots of stuff
[15:04:56] <Krinkle> also for other build steps and stuff
[15:05:06] <Krinkle> look at this one for a simpler example
[15:05:06] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/grunt.js
[15:05:21] <Krinkle> that also contains the linting and testswarm submissions, without most of the other stuff
[15:06:27] <gnarf> Krinkle: btw, whats your availability looking like this weekend?
[15:06:38] <gnarf> Krinkle: i'm definitely moving swarm over the next 2 days
[15:06:50] <gnarf> i doubt i'll need anything from you
[15:06:59] <gnarf> but it'd be nice to have you around to look over it :)
[15:15:12] <dme> Krinkle: so should I add those devDependencies to testswarm.json file, for node-testswarm's package.json?
[15:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Did you write the code for Trac's ticketgraph?
[15:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Nevermind, quick Google search answered that question :-)
[15:45:10] <snover> boom
[15:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> snover: It'd be nice to be able to filter tickets for the graph.
[15:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'll send a PR if gnarf let's me hack on the server :-P
[15:48:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think jq05.stage.jquery.com is currently hosting a stage.bugs.jquery.com
[15:48:40] <gnarf> that you could tweak with
[15:48:44] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[15:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> I would love to be able to look at a graph of just bugs
[15:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: http://stage.bugs.jquery.com/ -> 404
[15:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> 205.186.155.154 stage.bugs.jquery.com
[15:52:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it might actually be called "bugs.jquery.com" in the server config
[15:52:32] <gnarf> if you wanna ssh there and fix that
[15:52:34] <gnarf> yer welcome
[15:52:35] <gnarf> :)
[15:52:42] <gnarf>  /etc/nginx/conf.d most likely
[15:53:16] <gnarf> actually
[15:53:26] <gnarf> :3050
[15:53:29] <gnarf> just use that port
[15:53:34] <gnarf> the vhost frontends aren't setup yet
[15:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Should the actual directory be bugs.jquery.com or stage.bugs.jquery.com?
[15:55:01] <gnarf> dns doesn't matter, just hit the port
[15:55:07] <gnarf> directory on the server i think is bugs.jquery.com
[15:57:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: drop bug is related to outerWidth({ margin: true });
[15:58:59] <gnarf> apparently that used to do something
[15:59:05] <gnarf> and now its being treated like a setter?
[15:59:32] <gnarf> works if you remove the { margin: true }
[16:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't that be .outerWidth( true ) ?
[16:01:33] <gnarf> is true even needed?
[16:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> probably not
[16:02:16] <gnarf> but yeah
[16:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> find / -name 'ticketgraphy.py' -> no results
[16:02:23] <gnarf> ill commit that
[16:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[16:02:47] <gnarf> no ticket # needed right scott_gonzalez?
[16:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> Helps if you type the filename correctly.
[16:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: If it's broken in 1.7.2, we should probably add a ticket.
[16:03:41] <gnarf> drop works with 1.7.2
[16:03:50] <gnarf> its the outerWidth change in 1.8 that breaks
[16:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> ok, no ticket then
[16:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...there are 5 instances of the ticketgraph plugin on this server.
[16:05:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: 1-8-stable is using {margin:true}
[16:05:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: should i also patch there?
[16:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[16:05:46] <scott_gonzalez> cherry-pick -x
[16:06:35] <snover> scott_gonzalez: i accept most pull requests eventually
[16:06:44] <snover> workload is dangerously high atm
[16:06:56] <scott_gonzalez> snover: I'm sure it'll be small.
[16:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> I modified all 5 versions, none of them made a difference :-/
[16:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> snover: I should be modifying ticketgraph.py, correct?
[16:07:40] <snover> i think so, it has been a while
[16:07:43] <scott_gonzalez> I modified the default # of days to test.
[16:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you know how to figure out which of these files is actually being used?
[16:08:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: nope, i'm pretty lost when it comes to python libraries
[16:09:56] <snover> scott_gonzalez: just to make sure you know, after you make a change you have to restart trac
[16:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> snover: good to know
[16:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> How do I do that?
[16:10:41] <snover> umm. /etc/init.d/spawn-fcgi-trac restart i think?
[16:10:44] <snover> can’t remember
[16:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> bash: /etc/init.d/spawn-fcgi-trac: No such file or directory
[16:11:21] * scott_gonzalez Googles...
[16:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you know the command to restart Trac?
[16:13:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: /etc/init.d/trac-bugs.jquery.com restart
[16:13:57] <snover> i’m sure there’s something somewhere in /etc/init.d that has the word trac in it
[16:13:58] <gnarf> prolly
[16:14:24] <snover> just run everything in /etc/init.d alphabetically until it restarts, problem solved
[16:14:43] <scott_gonzalez>  /etc/init.d/trac-bugs.jquery.com: line 25: restart: command not found
[16:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> Just run stop and start?
[16:15:16] * scott_gonzalez should probably learn more about servers.
[16:15:48] <gnarf> sigh
[16:15:52] <gnarf> wtb MikeSherov
[16:21:22] <scott_gonzalez> Found the one that's being used :-)
