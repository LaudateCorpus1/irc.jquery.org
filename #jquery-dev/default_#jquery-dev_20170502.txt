[20:10:00] <BigCheese_> I've been using version 1.11.3 but changed to 3.... when I do that POST doesn't work. Is their documentation somewhere that lists changes from one version to another?
[20:13:49] <BigCheese_> Version 1.11.3 works great but I was checking out BootStrap and their examples call for <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script> once don't my jQuery AJAX code fails. Any ideas?
