[08:56:18] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by dmethvin (18h, 52m ago): Fix #10588. For now, event voyeurism only merits the look of disapproval.If you are using `.data("events")` we would like to know how we can provide a documented interface that satisfies the need.
[09:19:51] <gnarf> paul_irish: you around?
[09:28:22] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: yeah i am not sure how a plugin groping undocumented data is better than .unbind("click")
[09:29:19] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: thats like so disgusting
[09:29:23] <gnarf> the code style is atrocious too :)
[09:29:29] <DaveMethvin> i still haven't seen an example that convinces me we need to expose a complex method for this, i'd be okay with the hasEvents one
[09:29:53] <DaveMethvin> and the rest is just debugging which ppl can do with _data("events")
[09:30:12] <gnarf> except there is no $.fn.data() so its a minor pain to get around
[09:30:19] <DaveMethvin> well boo frickin hoo
[09:30:19] <gnarf> er $.fn._data
[09:30:27] <gnarf> but yeah
[09:30:30] <DaveMethvin> i don't think there should be one either
[09:30:34] <gnarf> agreed
[10:25:23] <paul_irish> gnarf: am now
[10:25:56] <gnarf> paul_irish: so i think i finally came up with something you standards guys might be able to find a solution to
[10:26:06] <paul_irish> o
[10:26:17] <gnarf> the left vs right / top vs bottom problem when writing effects that should work on arbitrary elements
[10:27:18] <gnarf> currently, most browsers (i think FF is the only one that doesnt) will actually return "auto" for .css( "right" )
[10:27:36] <gnarf> but FF i think is actually more accurate to the spec
[10:27:51] <gnarf> in that it shows what right WOULD be if it were set
[10:28:25] <gnarf> but - it makes it literally impossible for me to detect if after i do my animation, i should leave the element positioned with right/bottom or top/left
[10:30:05] <gnarf> I had an idea of supporting a new CSS prop that was the expansion of "left top right bottom" that MUST return auto if auto is being used
[10:30:49] <paul_irish> isCSSAuto
[10:30:49] <paul_irish> There is no way of determining if a CSS property is currently set to “auto”
[10:30:49] <paul_irish> This should be resolved, makes it much easier to do some types of animations
[10:30:58] <paul_irish> is that ya?
[10:31:14] <gnarf> paul_irish: that would help a lot yes
[10:31:29] <paul_irish> can you write up the issue on the standards issue tracker? using the format of the first couple?
[10:31:36] <paul_irish> sounds like a good one
[10:31:56] <gnarf> yeah, is that isCSSAuto already out there somewhere?
[10:33:22] <paul_irish> gnarf:  its from a talk resig did a while ago
[10:33:50] <paul_irish> http://www.slideshare.net/jeresig/jquery-and-the-w3c
[10:46:56] <gnarf> paul_irish: https://github.com/jquery/standards/issues/16 please feel free to edit this
[10:46:57] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #16 on standards, reported by gnarf37 (17.107s ago): No reliable way to determine if a CSS property is "auto"
[10:48:44] <paul_irish> thx
[11:08:07] <gnarf> paul_irish: https://github.com/jquery/standards/issues/3 - i already documented all the selector extensions a while back :)
[11:08:08] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3 on standards, reported by paulirish (1w, 14h ago): Available selectors don’t meet developer needs
[11:08:28] <paul_irish> gnarf: o rly
[11:08:40] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/jquery-selector-extensions/
[11:11:53] <gnarf> when i did my comparison it was against selectors level 3 tho i think
[11:14:09] <paul_irish> ah
[11:14:25] <paul_irish> we should see if our :not matches sel4's
[11:15:20] <gnarf> actually, maybe i did go against level 4
[11:15:23] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/ isn't marked
[11:17:24] <kswedberg> gnarf: :not() is part of css3
[11:17:47] <gnarf> blame paul
[11:17:48] <gnarf> :)
[11:17:52] <DaveMethvin> oh good kswedberg is here
[11:17:59] <kswedberg> hi DaveMethvin
[11:18:06] <DaveMethvin> so how would you like to do the pages that are goign to be updated?
[11:18:11] <paul_irish> o
[11:18:13] <DaveMethvin> i have a new .live() page
[11:18:28] <kswedberg> cool
[11:19:11] <DaveMethvin> i can email you an xml or whatever
[11:19:23] <DaveMethvin> or can I save an existing page as draft?
[11:19:29] <kswedberg> sure. or put it in oksoclap.com somewhere. or google docs.
[11:19:40] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[11:19:49] <kswedberg> no. can't save existing page as draft. sadly. :(
[11:19:56] <DaveMethvin> i'll get a few pages cleaned up and let go of them so you can do your magic
[11:20:08] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: sounds great
[11:21:14] <gnarf> kswedberg: im not sure i'll have time to write out docs for my stuff before monday
[11:21:25] <gnarf> kswedberg: some of it is pretty easy tho
[11:22:02] <kswedberg> gnarf: ok. if you can give me status on what you've done and what still needs to be done by eod tomorrow, that would be awesome.
[11:22:24] <gnarf> http://oksoclap.com/1-7-docs is basically all my notes / quick descriptions of changes
[11:22:42] <kswedberg> ok. cool deal
[11:22:43] <kswedberg> thx
[11:22:56] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin... new live() page... live() === don't be a idiot?
[11:23:16] <DaveMethvin> lol yeah kinda like that but politically correct :P
[11:23:52] <rwaldron> that's not politically incorrect
[11:24:09] <rwaldron> it's bad grammar... that's for sure
[11:24:13] <rwaldron> hahahah
[11:24:23] <rwaldron> I've been in a meeting for 3 hours
[11:24:38] <ajpiano> something more along the lines of like "we originally created live to be an event-delegation-only version of the popular liveQuery plugin"
[11:25:44] <kswedberg> ajpiano: or… we originally created live to be a drop-in replacement for bind, but with the advantage of event delegation
[11:25:49] <ajpiano> "over time, we realised that emulating that plugin caused significant overhead and also was inconsistent with traditional ways of approaching jQuery, so we introduced .delegate, and now have introduced .on"
[11:25:57] <ajpiano> yeah just something more... narrative
[11:26:21] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg ajpiano rwaldron http://oksoclap.com/xCkKlNI3qw
[11:26:25] <ajpiano> explaining that live is still there, but there are other methods etc
[11:26:48] <ajpiano> are we ever going to actually remove it?
[11:26:53] <ajpiano> if so deprecating is misleading
[11:26:59] <ajpiano> i mean, if not*
[11:28:38] <DaveMethvin> we can say "strongly discouraged" if you prefer, i would be up for removing it in 2.0 due to its drawbacks
[11:28:48] <ajpiano> is "Originally introduced in jQuery 1.3, as of 1.7, .live() is an archaic method of performing event delegation.
[11:29:06] <DaveMethvin> for example, we could take out a bunch of cruft relating to maintaining the .selector property which only live needs
[11:29:25] <DaveMethvin> since .selector can't really be maintained properly
[11:29:27] <ajpiano> strongly discouraged is good
[11:29:55] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin, ajpiano: I agree with Adam that some kind of brief historical narrative would be good.
[11:30:08] <DaveMethvin> sure do you want to add it?
[11:30:11] <kswedberg> sure
[11:30:55] <gnarf> "Before jQuery 1.7, to stop further handlers from executing after one bound using <code>.live()</code>, the handler must return <code>false</code>. Calling <code>.stopPropagation()</code> will not accomplish this."
[11:31:22] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: that doesn't make much sense to me
[11:32:01] <DaveMethvin> well it used to be that stopprop didn't work in stopping the bubbled event on the delegated target, now it does
[11:32:17] <DaveMethvin> but i agree it seems pretty dense, it was fromt he original page and i didn't edit it much
[11:32:35] <DaveMethvin> how about "live is broken, don't use live" :P
[11:34:56] <DaveMethvin> i think what makes live so difficult for people to understand is that we made it seem like magic, they couldn't "see" that the event was delegated to document
[11:35:25] <ajpiano> so we can say something like that
[11:35:33] <DaveMethvin> we had a ticket a few days ago where someone expected a detached element to get a live event because the docs said something like "elements created now or in the future"
[11:35:57] <DaveMethvin> well the new examples there make it explicit that document is the delegation point
[11:36:06] <gnarf> it did too much magic
[11:36:22] <Rwhitbeck> People love magic
[11:36:32] <DaveMethvin> until it bites them in the ass
[11:36:35] <gnarf> whereas .on does ALL magic
[11:36:42] <DaveMethvin> yes!
[11:36:50] <kswedberg> ?box
[11:36:51] <bot-t> kswedberg, ThickBox 3.1 - http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/
[11:36:57] <kswedberg> bot-t nooo!
[11:36:59] <Rwhitbeck> .on() - this is the magic you are looking for
[11:37:00] <DaveMethvin> not good enough, bot-t
[11:37:01] <ajpiano> o
[11:37:13] <kswedberg> .box do all magic!
[11:37:18] <ajpiano> i'm inclined to say mentioning liveQuery etc, will provide context
[11:37:36] <DaveMethvin> well it will to us old-timers
[11:37:44] <DaveMethvin> feel free
[11:37:47] <ajpiano> cause like, we basically implciitly said that this will *detect* new elements, when in reality it was event delegation
[11:37:55] <rwaldron> kswedberg What You Think???
[11:38:01] <kswedberg> :)
[11:39:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah i rewrote the discussion in .on() to make it more in terms of event delegation, and clarify that the place where you attach the element MUST be there no matter what
[11:39:08] <kswedberg> rwaldron: I think you funny man
[11:39:15] <DaveMethvin> it's just that when you attach to document or document.body it's always there
[11:39:49] <kswedberg> ajpiano: I think referring to liveQuery will muddy the waters for people who don't know about it (which is a lot of people).
[11:40:02] <ajpiano> kswedberg: ok
[11:40:04] <DaveMethvin> so there's no real magic going on for elements that are born later, it's just that their bubbling events make it to an element that has a handler
[11:40:09] <ajpiano> can always put an article on the learning site
[11:40:12] <rwaldron> kswedberg you and mary poppins, guvnah
[11:40:15] <ajpiano> "Why Live Isn't Good"
[11:40:16] <ajpiano> etc.
[11:40:19] <kswedberg> yeah
[11:40:31] <DaveMethvin> i'm up for some learning articles at some point
[11:40:51] <DaveMethvin> i still want to do the one explaining prop and attr more
[11:41:11] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: pip pip
[11:41:13] <ajpiano> gnarf: by any chance did dan ask you about helping with the deploy
[11:41:15] <ajpiano> for learning site
[11:41:34] <gnarf> ajpiano: not yet
[11:41:45] <ajpiano> hm
[11:41:58] <gnarf> dan seems super swamped this last week or so
[11:42:05] <ajpiano> yeah
[11:42:07] <gnarf> haven't seen him arund
[11:42:31] <ajpiano> there's a deploy script that is in php and having what we think is permission porabalems
[11:42:45] <ajpiano> danheberden can possibly tell you more soon
[11:42:52] <gnarf> k
[11:43:20] <danheberden> gnarf do you have access to learn.jquery.com?
[11:46:59] <gnarf> not sure if i do yet
[11:47:23] <gnarf> dont thik so
[11:48:08] <danheberden> k - lemme get you in there, cuz i'm sure you'll be able to square it up in a minute or two
[11:48:40] <danheberden> apparently for me getting php to shell_exec the `nanoc compile` process is like reasoning with a two year-old

[12:12:00] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10601#comment:3
[12:12:23] <gnarf> im pretty sure he meant use your texteditor to match that regexp
[12:12:53] <gnarf> not search for the regexp itself in the source
[12:12:56] <gnarf> :)
[12:21:00] <rwaldron> gnarf interesting.
[12:21:05] <rwaldron> you're probably right.
[12:21:14] <rwaldron> but the OP should've said that
[12:21:30] <gnarf> rwaldron: course, its a good thing his RE skills are so amazing
[12:21:35] <rwaldron> incidentally, i turned on regex search in textmate
[12:21:42] <rwaldron> and didnt find a match
[12:22:01] <gnarf> i would have said search for if \(\S
[12:22:21] <rwaldron> lemme see
[12:22:40] <rwaldron> yeah. no match
[12:22:50] <rwaldron> wrong
[12:22:58] <rwaldron> i switched OFF the check box
[12:23:03] <rwaldron> it was previously on
[12:23:04] <gnarf> setOffset has a few
[12:23:16] <gnarf> $.fn.init has one
[12:23:47] <rwaldron> yeah, got thos
[12:23:49] <rwaldron> those*
[12:24:54] <gnarf> random question
[12:25:07] <gnarf> is there any DOM method of listing event listeners?
[12:29:40] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: do you think .hasEvent() has any "legit" uses?
[12:29:52] <DaveMethvin> now i am starting to wonder ....
[12:30:10] <gnarf> `hasEvent` might be a use case we could provide support for, but I'm siding with @dmethvin here.  I think there will always be a better alternative design than peeking at attached event handlers.  This is evidenced by the fact that the pure DOM events have no similar method.  **NOTE:** I still feel that the debugging clause has its uses, but you shouldn't ever need a `hasEvent` in production code.
[12:30:42] <DaveMethvin> really good point about DOM events
[12:30:46] <gnarf> im not putting words in your mouth there am i?
[12:30:54] <rpflo> I agree.  if you're checking if something has an event, then you don't know what you're doing.
[12:30:55] <DaveMethvin> if you are they are tasty words
[12:31:03] <gnarf> fair nuff
[12:31:32] <DaveMethvin> rpflo: i just  have never wanted to ask that other than debugging
[12:31:41] <ajpiano> hey rwaldron don't do the rain dance and forget an umbrell
[12:31:45] <ajpiano> umbrella*
[12:31:47] <gnarf> I've NEVER been like "oh, did i bind this event yet?"
[12:31:53] <gnarf> that seems stoopid
[12:31:59] <DaveMethvin> oh damn i did, forgetful me
[12:32:14] <DaveMethvin> i know, why don't i set some flaggy thing to remind me
[12:32:21] <rpflo> DaveMethvin: debugging makes sense, but in real code you have state management issues if you're branching off of hasEvent
[12:32:28] <ajpiano> $("foo").hasEvent("click") sounds like step 1 of a really bad plan
[12:32:29] <ajpiano> :/
[12:32:35] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:32:44] <gnarf> agree
[12:33:18] <DaveMethvin> when faced with an event problem, some people say, "Hey, i'll use hasEvent." now they have two problems
[12:33:21] <ajpiano> "so i just step on the gas...?" "yep" "right off the cliff?" "yeah"
[12:33:24] <gnarf> heheh
[12:33:52] * gnarf wants to save that quote for posterity
[12:33:56] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: when faced with an event problem, some people say, "Hey, i'll use hasEvent." now they have two problems
[12:34:11] <gnarf> bot-t: hasEvent is DaveMethvin: when faced with an event problem, some people say, "Hey, i'll use hasEvent." now they have two problems
[12:34:11] <bot-t> gnarf, Stored "hasEvent".
[12:34:24] <DaveMethvin> it's a take on a jwz quote about regexps
[12:34:28] <gnarf> yeah i know
[12:34:37] <gnarf> thats why i love it
[12:35:12] <rwaldron> gnarf all updated
[12:35:27] <gnarf> it was like the anti-"Parsing HTML with Regexp" camp on SO's favorite quote for a while
[12:38:21] <ajpiano> rwaldron: sometimes ppl make duplicates cause like, trac is slow for a second and they hit submit twice or some other wacky thing happens
[12:38:31] <ajpiano> you should be happy people are actually reporting styleguide issues :)
[12:39:09] <ajpiano> im making a new policy right now
[12:39:12] <ajpiano> called we can just delete those
[12:39:19] <ajpiano> dupes should be for multiple reports of the same underlying issue
[12:39:23] <ajpiano> not the exact same ticket
[12:39:36] <ajpiano> reported twice in the same 3 seconds by the same poster.
[12:39:56] <rwaldron> ajpiano don't defend them
[12:40:10] <rwaldron> they do it because they heard it annoys Rick Waldron
[12:40:13] <rwaldron> SPECIFICALLY
[12:40:25] <ajpiano> true

[12:40:39] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin time sensitive PR
[12:40:46] <rwaldron> #565

[12:41:18] <rwaldron> and will likely cause conflict with anything else
[12:41:40] <skamikaze> o/
[12:41:50] <DaveMethvin> ok so i'll land this now but i want to look at it as well
[12:41:55] <DaveMethvin> not that i don't trust you
[12:42:07] <DaveMethvin> these kitchen sink changes are such a pain diff-wize
[12:43:00] <skamikaze> i got a minor suggestion on jquerys makefile => JS_ENGINE=`which node nodejs 2> /dev/null`
[12:43:30] <skamikaze> suppresses error on which call (would be very nice -espacially on jquerymobiles build)
[12:43:41] <skamikaze> *especially
[12:44:59] <DaveMethvin> skamikaze: YES finally someone else sees that too
[12:45:27] <DaveMethvin> it could also be done with a conditional which, i have a commit around here for it
[12:45:58] <skamikaze> you mean sth like which node || which nodejs ?
[12:46:48] <skamikaze> fiddled a bit with a conditional which but it feeled to complicated compared to a one liner
[12:47:01] <skamikaze> but maybe your solution is cleaner than my approach
[12:48:12] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin that diff is pretty clean
[12:48:21] <rwaldron> the only things that changed are the things i changed

[12:55:49] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin the good news is that jQuery has never passed on jenkins
[12:55:56] <gnarf> i would have probably squashed it
[12:56:03] <skamikaze> lol rwaldron :D
[12:56:08] <rwaldron> gnarf ....? but usually there is 1,2,3?
[12:56:19] <rwaldron> i've never seen it publish for each commit
[12:56:23] <rwaldron> only for the pull request
[12:56:30] <rwaldron> anyway
[12:56:32] <DaveMethvin> well now that i know jenkins is gonna tweet them all, i definitely will squash them
[12:56:34] <rwaldron> maybe i'm wrong
[12:56:34] <gnarf> rwaldron: thats cuz most of those guys use pulley, which squashes
[12:56:44] <rwaldron> gotcha
[12:56:54] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: thats not jenkins - thats the commit hook
[13:03:40] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/hi5Kcg
[13:03:40] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Pass correct arg list to special._default. Thanks @mikaelkaron! - Dave Methvin

[13:07:47] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #144: STILL FAILING in 3 min 58 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/144/
[13:07:48] <jq-jenkins> dave.methvin: Pass correct arg list to special._default. Thanks @mikaelkaron!
[13:09:37] <DaveMethvin> ok so what else in the pull queue should go into rc2?
[13:11:25] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i don't think any of them
[13:11:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah i don't think any are critical
[13:11:41] <DaveMethvin> and some could be risky
[13:11:53] <DaveMethvin> so they can at least wait for 1.7.1
[13:12:46] <timmywil> i went through them during beta2.  some need better solutions
[13:13:05] <DaveMethvin> some of those mikesherov ones look like they could land in a .1, unless you saw issues
[13:13:49] <DaveMethvin> gotta run for a minute
[13:19:23] <rwaldron> timmywil i could've sworn i left that same comment
[13:19:46] <rwaldron> hm
[13:19:56] <rwaldron> either in here or on the original PR?
[13:20:25] <timmywil> yea i think we've talked about it before
[13:21:01] <rwaldron> i hate client work
[13:21:04] <rwaldron> i miss you guys
[13:21:10] <timmywil> ditto
[13:21:29] <timmywil> well, not hate it but
[13:21:45] <rwaldron> i dont like this particular client
[13:22:49] <timmywil> if anyone wants to pay me to work on jquery all day, i would accept that
[14:12:02] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/LW0QFA
[14:12:02] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] DRY the hover pseudo-event, get the type right, allow override. - Dave Methvin
[14:16:17] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #145: STILL FAILING in 4 min 6 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/145/
[14:16:18] <jq-jenkins> dave.methvin: DRY the hover pseudo-event, get the type right, allow override.
[15:17:13] <gnarf> ajpiano: yt?
[15:17:38] <ajpiano> sup
[15:17:48] <ajpiano> we're having our learn call atm
[15:18:20] <gnarf> im looking at the server now
[15:24:03] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: just to point out, we have been storing the events in the "private data" since 1.5
[15:30:37] <DaveMethvin> right i should be saying "expose it in the public interface" which is what made the code so ugly
[16:10:47] <mikesherov_> hi
[18:12:55] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[18:13:03] <rwaldron> i misread your comment on that PR
[18:13:38] <rwaldron> we absolutely should be appending temporary junk elements to #qunit-fixture
[18:13:56] <rwaldron> because it's guaranteed that they are cleaned up after every test.
[18:22:01] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: are you around?
[18:22:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[18:22:32] <DaveMethvin> gnarf yeah
[18:23:04] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you willing to talk with us UI guys about our mouse+touch abstraction layer? We on skype atm...
[18:23:11] <DaveMethvin> sure
[18:23:32] <DaveMethvin> you wanna call?
[18:38:21] <DaveMethvin> http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/ieblog/2011/oct/samemarkuptouch.html
[18:43:00] <mikesherov> the js is pretty interesting
[18:43:31] <mikesherov> uses browser sniffing to detect VML
[18:44:32] <mikesherov> and document.documentMode !
[18:44:43] <mikesherov> that's fun
[18:45:40] <paul_irish> whaat
[18:46:27] <mikesherov> document.documentMode... you know, for when your browser acts like a different one, DUH
[18:46:43] <mikesherov> LOL
[19:08:50] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: that's how ms is suggesting developers combine the iOS/W3C and MS touch models ... THIS is a job for jquery-standards!
[19:21:18] <paul_irish> yeah msft is ppissing people off with that
[19:21:19] <paul_irish> but
[19:21:26] <paul_irish> ive seen people think its a bette rmodel
[19:21:33] <paul_irish> shrug
