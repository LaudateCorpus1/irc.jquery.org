[15:28:46] <dcherman> now that Symbols have landed in several browsers, would there be interest in using them as an alternative solution for storing the "unlock" in Data?  i'm seeing some sweet perf gains in my AngularJS apps with a locally modified version of jQuery that does that.  i'll file an issue to discuss further if you think there might be interest
[15:29:59] <DaveMethvin> dcherman: please do file an issue ... sounds like we might be able to do that without too much trouble?
[15:31:08] <dcherman> DaveMethvin: pretty easily.  you'd also want to extract the try/catch in there into a different function as well so that v8 and other compilers can optimize, but that's no big deal
[15:31:29] <dcherman> Data.key went from 70+ms CPU time down to 0.3ms in what i've been profiling
[15:31:38] <DaveMethvin> WOW
