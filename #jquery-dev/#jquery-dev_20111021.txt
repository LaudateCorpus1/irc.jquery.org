[02:44:25] <Zirak> A small question: Does jQuery do anything to make the returned value of the constructor look like an array?
[02:44:54] <Zirak> If you log for example jQuery() , the result is [] , and not a traversable Object
[02:47:01] <Zirak> I've spent some time browsing through the source, and found nothing that could explain why this happens. Is it some weird dev tools/firebug quirk, or something more profound?
[02:47:05] <mytoz> Zirak: I think the jquery object uses Array.prototype
[02:47:22] <mytoz> so the result is basically an array
[02:47:42] <mytoz> thus why firebug/dev tools display it like an array
[02:47:54] <Zirak> mytoz: I thought so too, but nothing in the source suggests that.
[02:48:00] <mytoz> oh, hmm
[02:48:58] <Zirak> They just implement some array methods (like push and slice). You also can't, for example, do jQuery().forEach, which you could do if they implemented Array.prototype
[02:49:16] <mytoz> interesting
[02:50:12] <Zirak> I've been staring at the source for about 3 hours in vain. Someone suggested that Firebug/dev tools just detect that it's jQuery and show it as an array...but that doesn't sound very, well, sane.
[02:59:03] <Zirak> Aha! We found it. It's basic feature detection
[02:59:26] <Zirak> Because of jQuery.prototype.length, jQuery.prototype.splice and jQuery.prototype.push
[02:59:57] <Zirak> If those exist, then the console reports it as an array
[03:00:36] <jzaefferer> quack!
[07:03:38] <timmywil> .
[07:03:46] <timmywil> weird
[07:04:28] <timmywil> ?tell jaubourg callbacks docs? http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-1-7s-callbacks-feature-demystified/
[07:04:29] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[16:33:01] <mikesherov> so, do contributor lists on github sort by impact?
