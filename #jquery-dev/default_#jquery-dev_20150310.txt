[11:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> leobalter JamesMGr_ jzaefferer: Have you ever seen a problem with QUnit URL config dropdowns not working in IE 7/8?
[11:33:42] <leobalter> nope
[11:35:13] <scott_gonzalez> leobalter: Try changing the jQuery version dropdown on http://view.jqueryui.com/master/tests/unit/progressbar/progressbar.html
[11:35:41] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't dug in yet, just noticed this.
[11:37:49] <leobalter> I'll need to do this at home, I'm without a windows VM here. I'll send a note to remember this
[11:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> That's what BrowserStack is for :-)
[11:42:36] <scott_gonzalez> You don't have to check it out now though. I just wanted to see if you had ever heard about this.

[12:50:54] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: hadn't noticed that before; might be shitty testing on QUnit's end
[12:52:00] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it applies to the checkboxes too.
[12:52:07] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't turn on no-try-catch.

[14:06:26] <leobalter> timed out :(
[14:13:54] <jzaefferer> leobalter: we still run a lot more browsers on testswarm than via browserstack-runner
[14:14:12] <jzaefferer> maybe we should disable to testswarm job for QUnit and add more browsers to browserstack.json?
[14:15:20] <leobalter> Travis worked fine when I broke the master branch, but the testswarm does usually timeout less often.
