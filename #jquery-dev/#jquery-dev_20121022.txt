[07:41:18] <snover> DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez: so that thing is over! looking forward to hearing from you about what’s happs
[07:41:38] <scott_gonzalez> snover: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticketgraph :-)
[07:41:52] <DaveMethvin> we got a ton of new contribs
[07:41:57] <snover> looks like someone closed some tickets
[07:42:16] <scott_gonzalez> About half of the UI tickets were triaged.
[07:42:21] <scott_gonzalez> Got a bunch of bug fixes.
[07:42:26] <DaveMethvin> yes, your name was lifted high as an example snover
[07:42:43] <DaveMethvin> i'm excited about the new contribs
[07:42:45] <snover> “if you’re like this guy, we’re going to kick you out”
[07:42:49] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[07:42:49] <DaveMethvin> haha
[07:43:04] <DaveMethvin> more like, "see that giant drop in the core bugs graph? snover.
[07:43:33] <snover> man, fewer than 150 bugs in core. a zero bug future is like…in your future
[07:43:45] <DaveMethvin> really excited about the new contribs, some are rough around the edges, but they have potential
[07:45:50] <snover> super cool
[08:58:47] <mikesherov> snover: I was inspired by the snover cliff
[08:58:57] <mikesherov> I'm trying to create a sherov cliff in UI
[08:59:04] <mikesherov> just by triaging the chaff away
[08:59:13] <DaveMethvin> snover cliff > ballmer peak
[08:59:14] <snover> that’s how it works!
[08:59:47] <mikesherov> ajpiano showed me the ?days=X feature on the ticketgraph
[08:59:52] <mikesherov> and I was inspired
[08:59:53] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticketgraph?days=3000
[09:02:16] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov gnarf rwaldron timmywil gibson042 jaubourg meeting time!
[09:02:49] <DaveMethvin> saiwong carldanley (and others?) I see you're on as well, you're welcome to drop into #jquery-meeting to see sausage being made
[09:03:09] <mikesherov> saiwong, definitely
[09:03:17] <mikesherov> carldanley too
[09:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Is it safe to assume that element.nextAll().insertBefore( element ) will keep the "next" elements in the same order?
[09:26:15] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like it should be safe, since all methods sort in DOM order and use .each().
[10:01:55] <gibson042> scott_gonzalez: yes, that's right
[10:07:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems strange to move everything but the element
[10:07:18] <gnarf> when really, you just want to move the element to the end
[10:07:25] <gnarf> but i suppose it might fix that clicky issue
[10:10:12] <gnarf> whats the URL for vote btw?
[10:11:57] <gibson042> gnarf: for core 1.9? http://bugs.jquery.com/query?keywords=~1.9-discuss&order=priority
[10:12:56] <gnarf> gibson042: im seeing if i can figure out how to let you vote
[10:13:06] <gibson042> k, thanks
[10:16:19] <gnarf> gibson042: can you vote now?
[10:17:03] <gibson042> sure can; thanks!
[10:19:07] <gnarf> danheberden / mikesherov / ryanneufeld: For future knowledge - To give someone vote permission on trac, add them to /var/www/bugs.jquery.com/public/htdocs/common/js/folding.js (search for "Voting")
[10:21:37] <danheberden> hopefully we can make that, like, non js authenticated lol
[10:30:26] <jqcommit> [jquery] mikesherov pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/y7glmA
[10:30:26] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] new JSHINT mixed spaces/tabs is smart enough to not warn on multiline comments, rendering smarttabs useless - Mike Sherov
[10:32:17] <mikesherov> gnarf: can you restart nginx so the cache gets busted?
[10:33:23] <gnarf> mikesherov: sure, but I don't think nginx is actually caching there
[10:33:44] <mikesherov> yeah
[10:33:48] <mikesherov> whatever it is
[10:34:03] <mikesherov> it's the same problem I had modifying ticketgraph js
[10:34:10] <mikesherov> which is still unresolved
[10:36:19] <gnarf> might be trac caching
[10:36:33] <gnarf> lemme restart tracd
[10:36:54] <gnarf> mikesherov: just poked tracd
[10:36:56] <gnarf> any change?
[10:37:40] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yup, it fixes the click issue. It seems less ideal of a solution, but in reality there shouldn't be any elements that get moved which wouldn't potentially be moved via append on click anyway.
[10:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> Since the dialog is appended on open, the only thing that would get moved via .insertBefore() would be other elements appended after the dialog is opened.
[10:46:33] <timmywil> down to 2 assigned to me for 1.9
[10:46:50] <timmywil> I know I'm doing more for 1.9, so I need to find those
[10:53:42] <gnarf> I threw some votes around on the 1.9 list
[11:01:23] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #456: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/456/
[11:01:23] <doesallmagic> mike.sherov: new JSHINT mixed spaces/tabs is smart enough to not warn on multiline comments, rendering smarttabs useless
[13:40:56] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yt?
[13:41:15] <gnarf> and/or scott_gonzalez: I want to land a pull on jquery-color, but curious what my CLA steps need to be
[13:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> You need to get them to sign the CLA before landing the commit.
[13:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> I think
[13:44:16] <scott_gonzalez> At least, that's what I would do.
[13:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> I saw DaveMethvin tell someone they needed to sign the CLA if they wanted to be in AUTHORS.txt.
[13:44:32] <gnarf> is there a list of people already signed?
[13:44:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, one sec.
[13:45:07] <scott_gonzalez> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj5JJFjq9rZDdFJucXdGZXlRdVh2SUVUb2hsb0FBYkE#gid=0
[13:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> You should have access to that.
[13:45:58] <gnarf> hrm
[13:46:12] <gnarf> could we get this to reference github account name or something?
[13:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: The commit itself should have proper author info.
[13:47:02] <scott_gonzalez> You need to verify that either way.
[13:51:39] <gnarf> that spreadsheet gets updated as people sign right?
[14:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[14:28:48] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you there?
[16:12:23] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: what's with all the closed tickets that are up for voting?
[16:13:29] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: not that many
[16:13:45] <snover> DaveMethvin: what’s with all the closed tickets?
[16:13:48] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: well, four
[16:14:22] <DaveMethvin> that's what I call "pre-biased outcome"
[16:14:54] <DaveMethvin> who closed all those tix anyway?
[16:15:26] <DaveMethvin> if i was going to pick a nickname it would not be BillyRayPreachersSon
[16:15:29] <DaveMethvin> too hard to type
[16:15:36] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11887
[16:16:24] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: can you look through your assigned tix and let go of any you don't plan on doing soon?
[16:16:43] <DaveMethvin> don't Bogart  those tix, my friend
[16:16:53] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: I'd like to chime in on those votes, but parsing even a single ticket takes more time then I'm willing to invest :/ Too much discussion and paperwork that is not relevant to understanding the actual issue and its state. I can also see that the effort of cleaning that up isn't worth it, if that time can be spend on actually fixing the issue...
[16:17:19] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: understood
[16:17:56] <DaveMethvin> we only do voting for the hard-to-understand stuff
[16:18:05] <DaveMethvin> that way we can spread the blame around
[16:18:11] <jzaefferer> nice
[16:18:16] <DaveMethvin> YOU VOTED FOR IT!
[16:18:25] <DaveMethvin> we should let snover vote
[16:18:37] <jzaefferer> that's how board votes used to work, too, right?
[16:19:05] <DaveMethvin> board votes were for every trival thing
[16:19:22] <DaveMethvin> "let jzaefferer buy a USB drive" VOTE
[16:19:40] <jzaefferer> but how big?
[16:19:47] <snover> gibson042 likes to vote multiple times
[16:20:03] <DaveMethvin> and they still don't work b/c he isn't on the blessed list
[16:20:11] <snover> did the voting plugin go away?
[16:20:20] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: the board must approve any drive over 16GB :D
[16:20:32] <DaveMethvin> snover: it's there but the list is hard wired
[16:20:37] <DaveMethvin> i think
[16:20:39] <snover> no, it didn’t, so why do people vote on the commentsssss
[16:20:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i updated - gibson counts now
[16:20:53] <DaveMethvin> ah ok gnarf
[16:20:55] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[16:21:03] <DaveMethvin> oh that's a different one snover
[16:21:09] <DaveMethvin> there's the voting thang at the top
[16:21:16] <gnarf> took a "grep -i gnarf " tho
[16:21:17] <gnarf> :)
[16:21:24] <DaveMethvin> and the team vote, triggered by 1.9-discuss
[16:21:25] <snover> yeah, there used to be a report that tabulated and displayed who voted on the tickets requiring votes
[16:21:39] <gnarf> snover: it was a specific report #
[16:21:44] <gnarf> that had the extra info
[16:21:53] <snover> i know! i made it! :F
[16:21:54] <gnarf> for the 1.6 vote i think
[16:22:08] <gnarf> snover: i dunno how to get it turned on for the report
[16:22:16] <snover> well, the report was a custom job
[16:22:18] <snover> sql
[16:22:43] <snover> oh well!
[16:22:52] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
