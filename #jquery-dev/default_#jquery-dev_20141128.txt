[03:59:18] <Hrusdik> Hello everyone. I have a problem with a script in IE 8 (yeah yeah, but my client can't move to another version), so I tried using JQ 1.7 and 1.9 and I have always the same error. My problem is in the clean method, when it recieves --> "<tr><td style="width: 100%; height: 0.6cm;" colspan="3"></td></tr></table></div>" <-- and tries last child after wrapping it in table, it fails in IE 8. But it does work in Chrome. Any ideas about 
[04:05:35] <Hrusdik> My bad, "</table></div>" is useless in my append, and IE 8 can't parse the HTMl.

[08:08:28] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I've got a little delay... I'm defending my Master's Thesis on Tuesday and I didn't have time to finish my PR (dropping IE6-7 etc.) and it doesn't seem I'll have time before Tuesday
[08:08:37] <m_gol> I hope that doesn't disrupt everyone's work too much
[08:08:48] <DaveMethvin> no problem, good luck on your defense!
[08:08:53] <m_gol> I've accumulated a little backlog ;)
[08:09:00] <DaveMethvin> haha yeah i can imagine
[08:10:39] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I'm not sure if I'll be able to attend the next meeting so I just wanted to mention I didn't disappear and I'll get back to my tasks once I'm done with the defense ;)
