[12:56:02] <marti_> Hi
[12:57:33] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15timmywil opened issue #3011: Revert Ajax behavior change in 1.12.2 02https://git.io/vay4U
[12:57:53] <marti_> Is there mentors of jQuery Mobile for GSoC ? 
[12:58:39] <m_gol> marti_: ask on #jqueryui-dev, that's where they talk :)
[12:59:08] <markelog> i honestly don't understand if we are better on fps front or not
[12:59:21] <marti_> thanks m_gol 
[12:59:33] <m_gol> markelog: me neither
[12:59:38] <markelog> it shows me like 3 fps, but those dots are fast!
[12:59:45] <m_gol> exactly, had the same
[12:59:51] <m_gol> if I select >300 dots
[13:00:06] <m_gol> I think it counts the number of dots
[13:00:18] <m_gol> and in the jQuery version there are often a lot less of them than they should
[13:00:31] <m_gol> and that's why the FPS counter shows such low values
[13:00:41] <m_gol> that'd be my guess at least :)
[13:00:55] <markelog> well, fps has pretty precise description
[13:00:58] <markelog> don't know
[13:01:11] <markelog> but as you said raf shouldn't more then 60
[13:01:12] <markelog> but
[13:01:16] <markelog> gsap uses raf
[13:01:20] <markelog> and it has 110
[13:01:34] <m_gol> maybe it doesn't cap at 60 fps, I'm not sure
[13:02:06] <markelog> should be, if i recall correctly
[13:02:16] <m_gol> or they're using more than just raf
[13:02:52] <markelog> yeah, trying to verify
[13:03:16] <all3fox> hello markelog and m_gol
[13:03:23] <all3fox> m_gol: did you have a chance to think about a project for GSoC?
[13:03:40] <markelog> m_gol: yeah, raf indeed https://github.com/greensock/GreenSock-JS/blob/b3d1ec5c50859a41a6574f098b698508e5304b55/src/uncompressed/TweenLite.js#L274
[13:03:44] <markelog> hey
[13:03:45] <m_gol> all3fox: I didn't, too busy at work, sorry :(
[13:04:05] <m_gol> markelog: yeah, I realise they use rAF but they may use more than that
[13:04:15] <m_gol> just guessing
[13:04:20] <markelog> like transitions or something?
[13:04:31] <markelog> they shouldn't
[13:04:39] <markelog> and there is nothing else there
[13:04:49] <markelog> couple tricks
[13:04:56] <markelog> but nothing more
[13:07:16] <m_gol> the benchmark shows 110 fps but the Chrome FPS counter shows 55-60 ;)
[13:08:36] <m_gol> anyway, gotta go
[13:20:14] <m_gol> timmywil: jquery@beta points to 2.2.2 on npm, it should be reset to 3.0.0-beta1. I can do that if you're OK with it.
[13:20:35] <timmywil> makes sense
[13:21:35] <m_gol> timmywil: updated
[13:22:19] <m_gol> and perhaps the compat tag should point to 1.12.2 instead of the current 1.11.3?
