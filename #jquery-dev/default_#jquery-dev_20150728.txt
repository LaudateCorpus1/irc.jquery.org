[03:54:49] <renatosoares> arthurvr: I've sent a message to leobalter. I was waiting him to reply.
[04:01:20] <renatosoares> arthurvr: do you mean a private message? Thx for answering me.. sorry for bothering you..
[04:02:18] <arthurvr> Just stick around for a while and somebody will be able to answer you (though note that support questions are better asked in #jquery)

[08:52:31] <DaveMethvin> that guy needs some serious help
[08:59:53] <arthurvr> DaveMethvin: Yeah, imagine how nice he is in person. 
[09:00:00] <arthurvr> I just had a long skype call with GitHub‚Äôs social impact VP and a security guy.
[09:06:39] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: shouldn't the CLA checker check all the matching entries, not just the first one?
[09:16:07] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[09:16:18] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: whatup?
[09:16:54] <m_gol> did you talk to someone from MS about how could we run tests against their restrictive Modern apps environmnent?
[09:17:32] <DaveMethvin> oh you mean the "Windows Universal Apps" or whatever they're named these days?
[09:17:36] <DaveMethvin> i haven't but  I can
[09:17:39] <m_gol> yeah
[09:17:40] <m_gol> I've submitted https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2504 adding non-browser support to compat (review welcome ;)), I'd love to test it since I've already found 2-3 places where I forgot to apply changes after submitting a PR
[09:17:56] <m_gol> but it seems we'll just be waiting for bug reports :D
[09:18:25] <DaveMethvin> ok i have to look at that then, seems like it might be hard to get non-browser stuff into compat until we get rid of IE8
[09:18:29] <DaveMethvin> but that's just a feling
[09:18:32] <DaveMethvin> feeling*
[09:18:58] <m_gol> if only IE8 goes into weird code paths meant for it, it shouldn't be a problem
[09:19:09] <m_gol> most issues have happened in support tests
[09:19:13] <DaveMethvin> well the feature detects can trigger issues tho
[09:19:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:19:32] <m_gol> they're much less crazy now that we dropped IE6-7, they had the weirdest tests, some of which had to be run on doc ready etc.
[09:20:08] <m_gol> I've even changed container for test divs from body to docElem as on master and it seems to work :)
[09:20:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw, that's nice
[09:20:29] <DaveMethvin> much better to do it sooner
[09:20:36] <DaveMethvin> before there is a body full of stuff
[09:21:27] <m_gol> in most cases they'll be performed after doc ready as they're lazy but I've checked what happens if I force-compute them all in head and it seems to work :)
[09:21:59] <DaveMethvin> oh true
[09:22:25] <m_gol> IE8 is much less crazy than IE6-7, even if you can't see it from the code we could drop ;)
[09:22:33] <m_gol> * from the amount of that code
[09:22:37] <DaveMethvin> alright, i'll check with some folks at MS about whether there's a way to do an automated test of their env
[09:22:56] <m_gol> that would be great
[09:23:09] <DaveMethvin> back in about 10 minutes
[09:23:14] <m_gol> this is one of the greatest things we fail to test - XHTML and hybrid envs
[09:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Well, really nobody should ever sign twice with the same email address.
[09:35:30] <m_gol> it happens, though, and it's not easy to go back from such a situation once it happens
[09:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: But we're going to start using all of the signatures. See https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license/issues/32
[09:35:53] <m_gol> thx ;)
[09:36:53] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: since you're here... I've removed Safari 6 testing from both Core & UI but I'm not sure about planned UI's releases; was that OK to do?
[09:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:37:56] <m_gol> k, thx
[09:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: So the official support is 7.0+, not (Current - 1) and Current?
[09:39:55] <scott_gonzalez> They're the same thing today.
[09:40:09] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: we use "(Current - 1) and Current" or "Current" only for evergreen browsers
[09:40:12] <scott_gonzalez> But is the plan to stay locked at 7.0+ for now?
[09:40:16] <m_gol> yup
[09:40:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:40:40] <m_gol> the idea is that once Chrome 45 is out, we can drop Chrome 43 but to drop Safari 7 we'd have to bump the major
[09:41:01] <m_gol> it seemed to make sense to treat browsers that are not automatically updated to the latest differently
[09:41:16] <m_gol> so that dropping a particular version is always a conscious choice backed by market share etc.
[09:42:02] <m_gol> Safari is actually now the only still developed desktop browser that's not evergreen
