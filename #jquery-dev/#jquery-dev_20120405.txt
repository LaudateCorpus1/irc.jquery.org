[10:07:18] <snover> scott_gonzalez: “Tell dojo to stop working in a bubble and work with the W3C” what is that supposed to mean?
[10:08:43] <scott_gonzalez> It means that dojo isn't helping the web if they're creating a full abstraction over non-standardized events like Touch and MSPointer.
[10:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> They should instead work with the W3C to standardize something.
[10:09:13] <snover> Because the two are mutually exclusive or something?
[10:10:23] <snover> As it turns out people wanna get work done, not paint the bikeshed, so of course we’ll be creating abstractions just like all libraries create abstractions for the DOM EventTarget IDL.
[10:11:49] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well, whatever, I'd rather have the web have a good standard than force everyone to use dojo to get reasonable event handling.
[10:12:10] <snover> Because obviously we’ve patented the interface so nobody else could implement it?
[10:12:21] <snover> I don’t know what this animosity is all about man but it’s not productive.
[10:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's not about nobody else being able to implement it.
[10:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> But while there's no standard, why don't you propose your abstraction to the W3C?
[10:16:41] <snover> There is a standard. http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/.
[10:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> snover: That is a draft spec
[10:16:53] <snover> It’s a CR
[10:17:51] <snover> not a draft
[10:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, it's a CR, it's not proposed and it's not a not a W3C REC.
[10:20:50] <snover> you know what else isn’t a REC? HTML5.
[10:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> How many browsre vendors implement HTML5?
[10:21:05] <scott_gonzalez> How many implement Touch?
[10:21:15] <scott_gonzalez> This isn't theoretical.
[10:22:02] <snover> I don’t understand. Can you say that again differently?
[10:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> WebKit has Touch. Other vendors are waiting on the spec, and would actually prefer something else.
[10:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know that MS would implement Touch, and I don't know that Apple would implement Pointer.
[10:24:49] <snover> That’s weird because MDC says that Mozilla has implemented the W3C Touch Event spec too…
[10:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> But Mozilla and Opera seem like they'd be pretty happy to implement whichever becomes a REC.
[10:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> W3C even started closer to MSPointer, Opera suggested something closer to MSPointer, Mozilla IMPLEMENTED somthing closer to MSPointer, and Microsoft HAS MSPointer.
[10:25:45] <snover> It is my understanding that nothing becomes a REC until there are at least two compatible supporting implementations
[10:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> Are there any docs about what dojo is doing?
[10:26:40] <scott_gonzalez> And would anyone working on this be willing to discuss it with the W3C?
[10:27:07] <snover> As far as I know, it is simply a shim to the current W3C spec
[10:27:10] <snover> I mean
[10:27:14] <snover> The abstraction layer does two things
[10:27:50] <snover> One, it provides cross-browser compatibility; two, it allows for the registration of custom events
[10:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> Are the people working on it aware of the patent and patent applications?
[10:28:08] <snover> I’m pretty sure the code is coming from IBM, who have the most anal lawyers in the universe
[10:28:58] <scott_gonzalez> Can you find out if they are willing to discuss this with the W3C?
[10:29:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure the Touch Events PAG would like to talk to the IBM lawyers who have looked into the patents.
[10:30:18] <snover> Can you provide contact information for whomever should be contacted?
[10:31:28] <scott_gonzalez> Doug Schepers schepers@w3.org
[10:32:00] <scott_gonzalez> Arthur Barstow art.barstow@nokia.com
[10:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> Email the two of them, and if you wouldn't mind CC me.
[10:32:15] <snover> And they are looking for which information specifically? Patent research? Usability suggestions?
[10:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> Both. For patent stuff, leave me out. For API design, please include me.
[10:33:31] <scott_gonzalez> The Touch Events WG has weekly calls, and this would definitely be of interest.
[10:34:31] <snover> OK, I’ll ask the component owner to get in touch.
[10:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[10:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know where the code lives?
[10:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> I assume it's in SVN, but not sure where it would be.
[10:38:59] <snover> So the event abstraction is at https://github.com/dojo/dojo/blob/master/on.js, convenience methods for touch are at https://github.com/dojo/dojo/blob/master/touch.js, and the experimental gestures API is at https://github.com/dojo/dojox/tree/master/gesture. It looks like nobody has landed mspointerevent support at this point. I will double check since I think that is supposed to be a goal for 1.8.
[10:39:44] <snover> fwiw the gestures support was bumped from core because the api wasn’t considered strong enough
[10:39:50] <snover> right before the 1.7 release
[10:40:11] <snover> There may also be some extra stuff in dojox/mobile but that code is pretty bad as well at the moment
[10:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, thanks.
[10:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> So that's abstracting to press, move, release, cancel.
[10:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> And then .on() normalizes the structure of the event object.
[10:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> Is that correct?
[10:44:28] <snover> at the moment, yes
[10:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> So, I don't think "it is simply a shim to the current W3C spec" is an accurate description. It's a new set of events, that don't look anything like Touch events.
[10:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> So the patents wouldn't apply.
[10:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...maybe they do look like touches? But they're also normalized to look like normal events?
[10:52:39] <snover> it tries to use the native touch events if they exist and falls back to mouse events if they don’t
[10:52:59] <scott_gonzalez> Right, but if it uses a touch event, then it mutates the event object to look like a normal event.
[10:53:14] <scott_gonzalez> Creating event.target, event.pageX, etc.
[10:53:42] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/dojo/dojo/blob/master/on.js#L503
[10:54:05] <snover> I think normalization occurs on all events regardless of type, though I have to imagine in the case of target, etc. that’s mostly to normalize oldie
[10:54:27] <scott_gonzalez> There is no event.target in Touch.
[10:54:35] <scott_gonzalez> There's pretty much no event.anything in Touch.
[10:54:41] <scott_gonzalez> It's kinda a shitty spec.
[10:57:38] <snover> I’ve sent an email to Evan asking him to send feedback, as well as to a PM at IBM that might have more resources. Hopefully you hear something in the next couple of days (looks like this team is in IBM China)
[10:57:52] <snover> For now I need to get back to work-work
[10:58:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, thanks for the details.
[12:47:52] <johnbender> jzaefferer: is there any way to quickly limit the browser stack requests, we need our builds
[12:48:29] <johnbender> :(
[12:53:57] <Krinkle> Is it acting up again?
[12:55:00] <johnbender> Krinkle: yah, were back up over 50+ forked httpd processes :(
[12:55:05] <gnarf> johnbender: thats not an issue
[12:55:14] <johnbender> gnarf: ?
[12:55:28] <gnarf> johnbender: load avg < 1, free mem 30% or so
[12:55:40] <Krinkle> hm.. how it httpd the problem?
[12:55:45] <gnarf> httpd is supposed to fork... it doesn't cause much of a problem
[12:55:46] <johnbender> gnarf: well we're running out of memory on builds
[12:55:47] <Krinkle> I thought the problem was browserstack limit
[12:55:49] <Krinkle> I guess not
[12:55:56] * Krinkle knows nothing about the server and shuts up
[12:56:07] <johnbender> gnarf: well forking instead of using workers is memory hungry but yes it is indeed supposed to fork
[12:56:13] <gnarf> johnbender: is it building on swarm.jquery.org?
[12:56:20] <johnbender> gnarf: yes
[12:56:36] <gnarf> most of the apache memory footprint is SHM
[12:56:52] <gnarf> johnbender: how much memory do you need to build?
[12:57:04] <gnarf> johnbender: we should probably just add some swap space on this machine
[12:57:10] <johnbender> gnarf: !
[12:57:15] <johnbender> I would love to do that but we can't
[12:57:16] <johnbender> lol
[12:57:22] <johnbender> that was the very very first thing that I watned to do
[12:57:25] <johnbender> a quick swap file
[12:57:40] <johnbender> but the way media temple is setup the machin won't boot with a swap file
[12:57:47] <johnbender> because they use memory as one element of billing
[12:58:30] <gnarf> johnbender: im not sure that reducing the number of apache processes will help much
[12:58:48] <johnbender> gnarf: the way it's supposed to work is that the memory can ostensibly "burst" to accomodate extra meed but it's a 32 bit machine
[12:58:54] <johnbender> so we can't address any more memory
[12:59:28] <johnbender> gnarf: I'm not convinced either but I'm trying to find memory wherever I can get it at this point
[12:59:47] <johnbender> and the httpd processes are the most obvious chunk
[12:59:55] <johnbender> it spikes to 70 forks
[13:00:14] <johnbender> gnarf: I should say that they jumped out at me
[13:00:17] <Krinkle> johnbender: Any particular url that stands out?
[13:00:30] <Krinkle> johnbender: (e.g. state=getrun or state=saverun or something)
[13:00:33] <johnbender> Krinkle: I can't tell what it's serving, but I haven't checked the access logs
[13:00:45] <Krinkle> I'd love to get some perf stats on testswarm
[13:00:52] <johnbender> Krinkle: !
[13:00:55] <johnbender> monitoring
[13:00:56] <johnbender> :D
[13:00:58] <Krinkle> Yes
[13:01:11] <Krinkle> monitoring on a real scale that is
[13:01:18] <gnarf> the new run of servers will have zabbix
[13:01:21] <johnbender> Krinkle: it's tough though in this case because adding anything to the server is an issue
[13:01:25] <Krinkle> we'll probably monitor it at Wikimedia soon, but right now it's not monitored at wikimedia
[13:01:37] <johnbender> gnarf: yah that's what I've been telling the team
[13:01:45] <johnbender> this should be temporary
[13:03:57] <johnbender> Krinkle: doing some log grepping
[13:04:04] <gnarf> johnbender: so right now you don't have enough memory to build?
[13:04:39] <johnbender> gnarf: it's off and on
[13:05:07] <Krinkle> johnbender: e.g which requests are taking the longest time to respond (or even time out)
[13:05:25] <Krinkle> likely caused by slow queries
[13:05:29] <Krinkle> mysql that is
[13:05:39] <johnbender> gnarf: you can look at the latest build history to see how it's been for the last couple of days: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/buildTimeTrend
[13:06:32] <gnarf> johnbender: i limited it to 40 forks to see if it will help
[13:06:46] <gnarf> but tbh - jenkins is the hog on that box
[13:06:54] <gnarf> and the lack of swap file is a bitch
[13:07:20] <johnbender> gnarf: you are absolutely correct on both counts
[13:07:41] <johnbender> gnarf: and we spawn jvm processes to minify css so that is a problem
[13:07:48] <johnbender> but we don't have another option really
[13:07:54] <johnbender> well
[13:07:56] <johnbender> that's not entirely t rue
[13:08:09] <johnbender> we are in the process of switching to grunt
[13:08:17] <johnbender> but that's not going to happen in the next couple of days
[13:08:23] <gnarf> right
[13:08:27] <johnbender> gnarf: what was the directive you altered to do that for my own education
[13:08:29] <gnarf> well i think i freed up ~300k
[13:08:34] <johnbender> :(
[13:08:54] <gnarf> johnbender: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf - MaxServers etc in the prefork module - i commented the old values
[13:09:00] <johnbender> gnarf: kk
[13:09:24] <gnarf> ServerLimit      40
[13:09:24] <gnarf> MaxClients       40
[13:09:24] <gnarf> MaxRequestsPerChild  200
[13:09:44] <johnbender> gnarf: when the new servers come up and these builds that create web content still need to run I'll probably do it with builtdbot
[13:09:50] <johnbender> *buildbot
[13:10:05] <johnbender> but before doing any of that stuff I'll consult you guys
[13:10:09] <johnbender> and it'll be well documented
[13:10:19] <gnarf> johnbender: well sadly, the newer servers will have more memory and swap files so the need to change is less :)
[13:10:41] <johnbender> gnarf: well the site and jenkins will be on different boxes right?
[13:10:44] <gnarf> we should be switching as much shit over to new servers this next week as we can from what i know
[13:10:54] <johnbender> gnarf: ahh very cool
[13:11:20] <gnarf> johnbender: potentially - i haven't seen dan's plan for that... its kinda convinent they are on the same machine tho as jenkins can checkout the project into the swarm folder directly
[13:11:54] <johnbender> gnarf: ah, I mean jquerymobile.com shouldn't be on the jenkins server right?
[13:12:09] <gnarf> i don't think it is atm
[13:12:12] <johnbender> cool
[13:12:25] <gnarf> but yeah, swarm & jenkins are a logical group
[13:12:36] <gnarf> but any other external facing sites will probably live somewhere else
[13:12:46] <johnbender> gnarf: so our branches preview build and the latest site build will have to be on the webserver
[13:12:51] <johnbender> in whatever for the "build" takes
[13:13:06] <johnbender> *form
[13:13:26] <gnarf> johnbender: that or we can setup some ssh keys for jenkins to be able to push his build to the prod servers
[13:13:33] <johnbender> gnarf: true
[13:13:43] <gnarf> depends on which workflow sounds better
[13:13:46] <johnbender> gnarf: I'm disinclined to give jenkins the keys to anything
[13:14:05] <gnarf> johnbender: are you or todd gonna be @ dev days?
[13:14:13] <johnbender> gnarf: before jqueryconf?
[13:14:21] <johnbender> or is that something else
[13:14:32] <gnarf> DC next week?
[13:14:37] <johnbender> I'm not
[13:14:42] <johnbender> not sure about todd
[13:14:57] <johnbender> gnarf: keys + jenkins ... shit makes me nervous
[13:15:15] <gnarf> johnbender: heh - understandably
[13:15:33] <johnbender> gnarf: whatever we do I will consult you guys first
[13:15:44] <gnarf> same
[13:15:46] <gnarf> :)
[13:16:01] <johnbender> it will live on beyond my involvement and I'm accutely aware of the pain in support other peoples config without information
[13:16:10] <johnbender> alright
[13:16:13] <johnbender> I'll leave you alone
[13:16:15] <gnarf> i doubt the lowering of httpd spares will be an issue for swarm though
[13:16:22] <johnbender> gnarf: yah probably note
[13:16:25] <johnbender> *not
[13:16:35] <johnbender> I might need to accelerate the css min change
[13:16:36] <gnarf> so if it helps free up a little mem for your build, im happy to help
[13:16:37] <gnarf> :)
[13:16:48] <johnbender> gnarf: thanks for your help :D
[13:18:03] <johnbender> gnarf: build worked, skin of our teeth :P
[13:18:27] <gnarf> johnbender: run another for me, i wanna watch top as it runs
[13:20:28] <johnbender> gnarf: rubbubg
[13:20:33] <johnbender> gnarf: running
[13:20:39] <gnarf> lol
[13:20:44] <gnarf> i liked the typo better :)
[13:20:46] <gnarf> holy balls
[13:20:51] <johnbender> yah
[13:20:52] <johnbender> lol
[13:20:57] <gnarf> that shit ate a meg
[13:21:08] <johnbender> gnarf: gig?
[13:21:12] <gnarf> gig yeah
[13:21:13] <gnarf> sry
[13:21:20] <gnarf> i was in base k ;)
[13:21:35] <johnbender> gnarf: the home row nubs on my keyboard aren't hyper pronounced
[13:21:40] <johnbender> typo
[13:21:59] <gnarf> it went from 1,3~~,~~~ to 3~~,~~~
[13:22:04] <johnbender> yerp
[13:22:07] <gnarf> crazy
[13:22:29] <johnbender> I wonder if that's just a function of the yui compressor ...
[13:22:39] <johnbender> keeping all its data structures in memory
[13:22:49] * johnbender sighs
[13:23:54] <johnbender> I keep going back to the fact that a simple swap file would solve all of this instantly :(
[13:24:21] <gnarf> johnbender: yeah
[13:24:37] <gnarf> johnbender: we should be able to get some drive space set aside for swap
[13:24:58] <johnbender> gnarf: I forget who the media temple guy was who we talked to but he said it was a no go
[13:25:36] <gnarf> johnbender: thats literally insanity to not allow someone to use a swap partition :)
[13:25:42] <johnbender> :D
[13:25:42] <gnarf> but it could just be that "class" of server
[13:25:46] <johnbender> yah
[13:25:52] <johnbender> and it's supposed to allow memory expansion
[13:25:56] <johnbender> but again
[13:26:01] <johnbender> it's 32 bit
[13:26:15] <gnarf> we are probably already having issues with doing more on that server than we should be anyway
[13:26:18] <gnarf> :)
[13:26:28] <johnbender> it's an impressive confluence of things

[14:01:02] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] add documentation links - Timo Tijhof
[14:13:51] <gnarf> danheberden: thanks :)
[14:14:42] <danheberden> gnarf is it busted?
[14:15:24] <danheberden> it looks up-to-date?
[14:15:55] <gnarf> danheberden: nope, i wanna make another cron for 1.8-git
[14:18:41] <danheberden> gnarf that's to go on the services box
[14:18:50] <danheberden> hence why i've been, like, trying to get teh servers done
[14:19:03] <danheberden> i didn't want that box even more loaded down
[14:19:07] <danheberden> as it crashes regularly
[14:21:36] <gnarf> danheberden: right - makes sense
[14:21:57] <gnarf> danheberden: I could move it
[14:22:06] <gnarf> danheberden: if we have a box for it to land on
[14:22:23] <danheberden> gnarf trying - it'd be awes if you could spare some time to help with the puppet stuff
[14:29:34] <jzaefferer> johnbender: have you tried squish? using that for CSS minifaction now instead of yuicompressor; my grunt-css plugin provides a cssmin task for that
[14:29:52] <jzaefferer> johnbender: see https://github.com/jzaefferer/grunt-css
[14:30:12] <jzaefferer> I meant "sqwish", that's the node module for CSS minifaction
[14:30:13] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah that's the plan
[14:30:22] <jzaefferer> What are you waiting for?
[14:30:24] <johnbender> just don't have the time right now
[14:30:36] <jzaefferer> You'd rather debug JVM memory issues? :p
[14:30:56] <jzaefferer> You could just replace the CSS task with `grunt cssmin` and leave the rest in your makefile
[14:31:01] <johnbender> jzaefferer: no I'd rather we get it back to the working state it was in before tuesday so that I can get to it when I have time I guess
[14:31:23] <johnbender> jzaefferer: definitely want to switch though
[14:31:33] <jzaefferer> if the thing needs a gig of memory to process a few css files, you shouldn't blame apache
[14:31:43] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I'm not blaming apache
[14:31:54] <jzaefferer> forks and all?
[14:32:01] <jzaefferer> Anyway...
[14:32:07] <johnbender> jzaefferer: if you read my conversation with gnarf you'll see what I mean
[14:32:13] <johnbender> it's clearly a jvm problem
[14:32:14] <jzaefferer> I can help set up some basics for grunt
[14:32:19] <johnbender> but I can't change it right now
[14:32:28] <jzaefferer> I've spend plenty of time with it
[14:32:37] <johnbender> we have a release in the next day or two and I'd rather not futz with the Makefile before then
[14:32:50] <johnbender> the makefile is super duper fragile
[14:33:16] <johnbender> thus, the long migration path to gruntness (in the grunt google doc)
[14:33:18] <jzaefferer> And that build is essential for the release?
[14:33:21] <johnbender> yes
[14:33:40] <johnbender> jzaefferer: well, the parts of the make file we would change affect the release build target
[14:33:47] <johnbender> release => "make deploy"
[14:36:27] <jzaefferer> Well, let me know if you can use my help on the conversion to grunt
[14:36:45] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I have no doubt I will, and I appreciate the offer
[14:36:52] <johnbender> hopefully I can get to it after railsconf
[14:36:56] <johnbender> that's my plan at least
[14:46:05] <jzaefferer> Have you started anything with grunt? I could just integrate the cssmin stuff - after the release you can then see about using that already
[14:46:23] <jzaefferer> That should be done in half an hour or so
[14:47:08] <johnbender> jzaefferer: anything at all you can contribute would be great
[14:47:20] <johnbender> jzaefferer: there's a grunt branch up there where I've started the migration to grunt
[14:47:36] <johnbender> beginning with moving the makefile stuff out to bash scripts that are run by the makefile
[14:47:46] <johnbender> jzaefferer: if you can start in there it would be huge
[14:48:54] <jzaefferer> What's with the bash scripts?
[14:49:02] <jzaefferer> I mean, why not just move to grunt in one step?
[14:49:05] <johnbender> jzaefferer: just an intermediate step between using the makefile
[14:49:11] <jzaefferer> Okay, but why?
[14:49:20] <johnbender> so that I can verify the output is the same as I make the migration
[14:49:28] <johnbender> jzaefferer: you don't do refactoring whole sale right?
[14:49:33] <johnbender> same with the migration
[14:49:49] <jzaefferer> Sure, but just keep the existing build and create the grunt.js in parallel
[14:49:54] <jzaefferer> then you have something to compare
[14:50:04] <jzaefferer> We did that for UI and it worked fine
[14:50:15] <jzaefferer> Just use a different output folder so that you can run both builds in parallel
[14:50:42] <johnbender> jzaefferer: if you want to get started with that in a different branch you're welcome to
[14:51:00] <johnbender> the grunt branch that's up there now is like an hour worth of work
[14:51:01] <jzaefferer> I really don't want to write any bash ;)
[14:51:22] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah, the problem is we use bash for what it does really wel
[14:51:28] <johnbender> file / text manip
[14:51:35] <jzaefferer> its still bash
[14:51:39] <johnbender> that part of migrating to grunt is going to be painful
[14:51:54] <jzaefferer> JS may not be the best tool, but I know it really well, that makes up a lot
[14:51:57] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I don't find bash that distasteful when it's used for it's intended purpose
[14:52:08] <jzaefferer> not talking about taste, just experience
[14:53:33] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I don't know node's stdlib at all so figuring out how to reproduce find's with execs etc etc is going to be time consuming f or me
[14:53:37] <johnbender> still on the roadmap though
[14:53:42] <jzaefferer> the grunt brunch doesn't yet have a grunt.js, right?
[14:54:41] <johnbender> jzaefferer: correct
[15:05:48] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: okay, it turns out that while trying to implement UserAction (since the logic of that is still  in UserPage), I will end up implementing useragents.ini first, I need "display name"
[15:05:58] <Krinkle> currently that is hardcoded in UserPage.php
[15:09:13] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Okay
[15:09:26] <jzaefferer> And btw. no, I don't think anyone needs to register just to run tests
[15:09:36] <jzaefferer> Who cares about scores
[15:14:16] <Krinkle> Scores are also added to non-logged in users
[15:14:43] <Krinkle> I basically wanted to make it (at some point) that users table is renamed to projects, and one can create a project instead
[15:14:46] <Krinkle> users don't create accounts
[15:15:14] <Krinkle> and only an admin can do so (by running a php script that inserts a row to it in the database)
[15:15:26] <Krinkle> allowing sign up doesn't make sense because only with a token it is useful
[15:15:33] <Krinkle> oh well, that[s for later, no reason to do right now
[15:15:46] <Krinkle> by the way, do you have any suggestions for a user agent parser?
[15:15:55] <Krinkle> Or just keep it as is for now
[15:16:43] <Krinkle> for example the fact that "Chrome" is chrome/.* but "Safari" is webkit/webkitVersion (Safari user agents have the word "Safari" in them with a Version/ annotation as well)
[15:16:46] <Krinkle> it seems a bit ugly all
[15:17:08] <Krinkle> so any other non-Chrome webkit browser will match as safari
[15:18:16] <Krinkle> for instance, last christmas someone disrupted (although with good intentions) the mediawiki swarm by joining with an Epiphany browser (which has bugs that Safari doesn't, but uses webkit and was recognized as Safar)
[15:18:18] <Krinkle> Safari*
[15:19:28] <jzaefferer> Related to that, we should look for stable, beta and dev Chrome's
[15:19:41] <jzaefferer> Whatever version that is at any moment
[15:19:47] <Krinkle> Right
[15:19:53] <Krinkle> http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-browser.php looks interesting
[15:19:59] <Krinkle> Uses http://browsers.garykeith.com/downloads.asp
[15:21:15] <johnbender> Krinkle: wurfl?
[15:21:26] <johnbender> I might be interjecting with useless information here though
[15:21:29] <Krinkle> I'd say lets run some tests with various parsers so that useragents.ini will only be a list of browser IDs that we want to support and map them to categories (mobile, gps, beta, popular etc.)
[15:21:43] <Krinkle> no regexes or stuff in it
[15:22:13] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I don't know node's stdlib at all so figuring out how to reproduce find's with execs etc etc is going to be time consuming f or me
[15:22:16] <johnbender> arg
[15:22:18] <johnbender> wtf
[15:22:24] <johnbender> Krinkle: http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/php_index.php
[15:22:34] <johnbender> not sure if that helps

[15:29:33] <jzaefferer> johnbender: Unless I'm missing something, I just generated the same CSS output with grunt/sqwish instead of yuicompressor
[15:31:33] <jzaefferer> replacing java calls within Makefile with grunt cssmin:… calls

[15:35:39] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] add annotations to testswarm-sample.ini - Timo Tijhof
[15:43:01] <johnbender> jzaefferer: pull request? I'm not clear if you have access to creat branches
[15:43:06] <johnbender> if you do you could just push a branch
[15:43:08] <johnbender> either way
[15:43:15] <johnbender> so I can take a look sometime this week or next
[15:43:19] <johnbender> hopefully tomorrow
[15:45:34] <jzaefferer> so the CSS min output isn't the same, dunno how I got there
[15:45:48] <jzaefferer> doesn't make sense for two different minifiers to produce the same exact output
[16:51:55] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: good news garetjax/phpbrowscap is awesome
[16:52:04] <Krinkle> even automatically updates itself
[16:52:06] <Krinkle> and caches it locally
[17:02:19] <Krinkle> most if not all ua bugs will be fixed
[17:08:16] <Krinkle> Any mobile experts  here? Wondering whether blackberry 5, 6 and/or 7 uses Opera Mini or if it has it's own branded browser
[17:08:44] <Krinkle> The new ua detector considers "Blackberry" and "Opera Mini" to be separate browsers. Although it does recognize that there is an Opera Mini with platform=Blackberry OS
[17:09:01] <Krinkle> so maybe blackberry once had it's own branded browser and now uses Opera Mini, or the other way around?

[18:33:53] <mikesherov> I closed all my PR's that WERE at the bottom
[18:34:08] <mikesherov> sure, I have thought
[18:34:10] <DaveMethvin> i just hate adding a bunch of "just in case" code
[18:34:11] <mikesherov> thoughts*
[18:34:26] <DaveMethvin> MATCH YOUR CASE, PEOPLE
[18:34:38] <DaveMethvin> .removeAttr("ChEckED")
[18:34:56] <mikesherov> exactly
[18:35:00] <mikesherov> who needs this
[18:35:07] <mikesherov> just use the right case
[18:35:25] <mikesherov> I fight to remove 8 bytes for this!?
[18:35:46] <DaveMethvin> it's just the crushing weight of the incremental cognitive loads
[18:36:14] <mikesherov> of course, I'll argue the opposite when it comes time to you see the final border box stuff I'm doing
[18:36:29] <DaveMethvin> well you banked like 450 bytes for later fights
[18:37:23] <mikesherov> yes
[18:37:48] <mikesherov> The border-box + vendor-prefix stuff is like 300 total
[18:38:03] <mikesherov> and I've tried really hard to make it as small as possible
[18:38:20] <mikesherov> I looked at that damn getWidthorHeight function for about 2 hours straight
[18:38:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah that one made me sad
[18:38:38] <DaveMethvin> not because it was bad
[18:38:40] <DaveMethvin> because it was big
[18:39:00] <mikesherov> but it needs to happen! You all voted on it!
[18:39:05] <mikesherov> so, in summary, close 724
[18:39:17] <mikesherov> for the case of css3!
[18:39:20] <mikesherov> sake*
[18:40:06] <mikesherov> it'll be so awesome when you can use .css('box-sizing') and it just works
[18:40:11] <mikesherov> think of the people
[18:40:13] <mikesherov> :-P
[18:40:31] <DaveMethvin> my boxes seemed to be quite a nice size already
[18:40:54] <DaveMethvin> i have a very nice 5-pound box
[18:40:59] <DaveMethvin> put 10 pounds of shit in it
[18:42:42] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[18:42:55] <mikesherov> but border-box is awesome
[18:43:11] <mikesherov> it allows you to do sane things
[18:43:14] <mikesherov> anyway
[18:43:31] <mikesherov> we voted, I don't need to convince you further :-P

[19:12:25] <DaveMethvin> ?tell mikesherov we're getting some offset failures but it looks like older Opera ... thoughts? http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=273&client_id=305
[19:12:25] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, Okay.
[19:38:12] <mikesherov> back
[19:38:13] <bot-t> (25 mins 40 secs ago) <DaveMethvin> tell mikesherov we're getting some offset failures but it looks like older Opera ... thoughts? http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=273&client_id=305
[19:39:07] <mikesherov> hmm
[19:39:16] <mikesherov> how old opera?
[19:40:05] <mikesherov> Opera 9.8? My thoughts are that we support current - 1, which I believe is 11.6 and 11.5
[19:40:19] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[19:40:23] <mikesherov> I can take a look
[19:40:36] <DaveMethvin> present and acct for mikesherov
[19:40:51] <DaveMethvin> it looked like it was opera 11.11?
[19:41:04] <DaveMethvin> who runs that?
[19:41:08] <mikesherov> Oh
[19:41:09] <mikesherov> Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 5.2; U; en) Presto/2.8.131 Version/11.11
[19:41:30] <DaveMethvin> between testswarm and jenkins i have very little hair left
[19:41:57] <mikesherov> that's 11.11?
[19:42:00] <mikesherov> Not 9.8?
[19:42:10] <DaveMethvin> i guess, seems strange
[19:42:25] <DaveMethvin> if it really is, I'd say we ignore it and pretend it never happened
[19:42:26] <mikesherov> nvm, it's Opera 11.11
[19:42:46] <mikesherov> Which is still unsupported
[19:42:50] <DaveMethvin> right
[19:42:50] <mikesherov> right?
[19:42:54] <DaveMethvin> RIGHT.
[19:42:57] <DaveMethvin> damn right
[19:43:09] <mikesherov> I'll take a look, because maybe there's a fix
[19:43:20] <mikesherov> but not before I finish the other stuff I gotta get done for you
[19:43:27] <DaveMethvin> i can't imagine it's that important
[19:43:35] <DaveMethvin> most opera users update quickly
[19:44:02] <mikesherov> yeah
[19:44:05] <DaveMethvin> i am REALLY looking forward to merging that closure compiler commit now that i've landed a dozen other pulls
[19:44:10] * DaveMethvin is really good at sarcasm
[19:44:11] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[19:44:24] <mikesherov> I can't wait till everyone has to maintain it
[19:44:27] <DaveMethvin> but i can't ask chad to do it ... poor guy he's done so much
[19:44:34] <mikesherov> Yeah, he's amazing
[19:44:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah we have some learnin' do do
[19:44:49] <mikesherov> I already read the chapters on it in the O Rielly book
[19:44:52] <DaveMethvin> but maybe that will discourage us from screwing with the public interfaces
[19:45:01] <mikesherov> now I just need to make a bunch of mistakes, and then I'll be all set
[19:45:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah i have the oreilly book too
[19:45:33] <DaveMethvin> but we need to, um, figure out the build process and stuff
[19:45:49] <DaveMethvin> this month will be interesting
[19:52:32] <mikesherov> yes, very
[19:52:40] <mikesherov> Almost done rebasing the test failures PR
[22:40:25] <gnarf> hrm
[22:40:30] <gnarf> getting close....
[22:59:50] <gnarf> <10% test fails on the new animation core
[23:00:14] <gnarf> sitting at around +300 gz right now though... hoping i can find some bytes to get rid of now with simpler logic
[23:59:06] <msk2020ckp> I need to submit the form on the same page(without URL) using AJAX
[23:59:08] <msk2020ckp> Here i used this code:
[23:59:10] <msk2020ckp> $.ajax({type: "POST",url: "postForm.ajax.php",data: $("#myForm").serialize(),dataType: "json"});
