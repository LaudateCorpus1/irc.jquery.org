[05:34:13] <spycrab0> hi i have the following problem if i want to use .live() it says that live is no function(Btw i'm using jQuery 1.4.4)
[05:35:41] <m_gol> spycrab0, this is a dev channel, you should go to #jquery, not #jquery-dev
[05:36:47] <m_gol> and jQuery 1.4 is so old... you should switch to 1.9.1 with the jQuery migrate plugin
