[07:47:37] <karan1276> Hey guys :)
[07:50:34] <karan1276> I wanted contribute to jquery documentation, i have choosen a issue to work on (issue #659), i want to set up a developing environment, I read this page : github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content 
[07:50:47] <karan1276> should i download wordpress to set it up?
[07:51:12] <karan1276> or do i only need virtual box and vagrant
[07:53:33] <karan1276> anyone?
[07:57:05] <gnarf> karan1276 hey!
[07:57:13] <gnarf> karan1276 first off #jquery-content is where most of the docs people hang out also
[07:57:20] <gnarf> karan1276: secondly, the vagrant box you download will include wordpress and set it up for you - you can also run jquery-wp-content on a local php/mysql/wordpress server
[07:57:49] <gnarf> karan1276: but unless you really want to check out what the change *looks* like locally, you can do most authoring without ever pushing it to the wordpress 
[07:58:01] <gnarf> It's just text :)
[08:02:57] <karan1276> Thanks @gnaf
[08:03:14] <karan1276> Thanks #gnaf
