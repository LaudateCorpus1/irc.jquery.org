[05:31:19] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell krinkle we're working hard to completely stop using docs.jquery.com over the next month or two.
[05:31:20] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[10:12:03] <paul_irish> rwaldron: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=80376#c2
[10:12:06] <paul_irish> classList perf!
[10:12:17] <paul_irish> 640% improvement
[10:12:19] <paul_irish> nbd
[10:13:28] <rwaldron> paul_irish oh shit
[10:13:30] <rwaldron> nice
[10:13:38] <rwaldron> time to dust those perf tests off
[10:13:51] <paul_irish> :D
[10:13:58] <paul_irish> this is all very fresh webkit stuff
[10:13:59] <paul_irish> but
[10:13:59] <rwaldron> thanks for the heads up there
[10:14:01] <paul_irish> yup
[10:14:10] <paul_irish> innerHTML also is 240% faster
[10:14:20] <paul_irish> and a bunch of other DOM stuff
[10:14:23] <rwaldron> i love that
[10:14:28] <paul_irish> basically webkit DOM just got 2-3x faster
[10:14:41] <rwaldron> nice, this is awesome news
[10:14:43] <rwaldron> :D!!!
[10:14:43] <paul_irish> we're putting together some stats and charts
[10:14:54] <paul_irish> show this shit off
[10:14:54] <rwaldron> can't wait to see them
[10:14:55] <paul_irish> boom
[10:14:58] <rwaldron> hell yeah
[10:15:02] <rwaldron> eta?
[10:15:08] <rwaldron> on release?
[12:03:23] <mikesherov> .
[13:21:21] <mikesherov> .
[13:21:30] <mikesherov> danheberden, you here?
[13:21:40] <danheberden> mikesherov aye
[13:21:48] <mikesherov> so I read up the meeting minutes
[13:21:58] <mikesherov> looks like I'm on task for trac?
[13:22:11] <danheberden> whatever you can do to help it out, would be awesome
[13:22:22] <mikesherov> right, so I think it comes down to a few things
[13:22:43] <mikesherov> I think we agree that the arbitrary HTML parser should be stopped?
[13:22:53] <danheberden> ya
[13:23:08] <mikesherov> OK, and then, the autolinker... nofollow?
[13:23:23] <mikesherov> that seems to be most of it, right?
[13:23:31] <danheberden> from what i understood from the thread
[13:25:22] <mikesherov> OK, cool
[13:25:28] <mikesherov> I'll see what I can do tonight
[13:25:38] <mikesherov> permission to fiddle around?
[13:38:45] <danheberden> mikesherov de
[13:38:46] <danheberden> *Def
[13:38:58] <mikesherov> OK, what happens if I break stuff?
[13:39:09] <mikesherov> Who do I contact?
[13:39:32] <danheberden> me - although if something breaks, i imagine 98% of that is something you can unbreak pretty easy
[13:39:54] <danheberden> we got backups 'n stuff, so worse case we bust 'em open
[13:40:12] <danheberden> but it's apparently awful enough to warrant this much attention so _something_ has to be done about it
[13:46:43] <mikesherov> OK
[13:46:46] <mikesherov> great, thanks

[14:28:12] <ajpiano> holy e-mails batman
[14:29:50] <mikesherov> holy emails?
[14:30:07] <mikesherov> what happened? trac notif emails are back?
[14:30:17] <ajpiano> a bunch of ones from one guy just all landed at once
[14:35:48] <mikesherov> OH, is it our spammer?
[14:36:05] <danheberden> mikesherov it is
[14:36:20] <danheberden> look at the white text http://danheberden.com/share/85da.png
[14:37:06] <danheberden> by the way - fuck you spammers. We spend so much goddamn time trying to get things working on their own and we have to deal with this shit
[14:37:09] <danheberden> </vent>
[14:39:04] <mikesherov> right, I spotted that guy about a week ago
[14:39:12] <mikesherov> I was actually accusing jaubourg
[14:39:20] <mikesherov> and then realized it was jaudourg
[14:41:02] <ajpiano> yeah, this is seriously twisted
[14:41:09] <ajpiano> the amount of effort someone is putting into hammering us
[14:41:14] <mikesherov> I'm on it tonight
[14:41:28] <mikesherov> removing the ability to insert HTML into comments
[14:41:37] <mikesherov> it's completely unnecessary
[14:48:14] <danheberden> mikesherov <3z
[14:48:50] <mikesherov> Well, don't love me yet
[14:48:57] <mikesherov> I haven't wrestled with Trac in a while
[14:49:04] <mikesherov> it's like super abstracted
[14:49:14] <mikesherov> meant to be the most extensible thing ever
[14:49:29] <mikesherov> and it's impossible to get small things done reasonably
[16:01:01] <mikesherov> .
[16:02:03] <mikesherov> .
[16:06:05] <mikesherov_> .
[19:25:07] <Eviltwin> So one of the attrHooks is to use "Use the value property for back compat"
[19:25:25] <Eviltwin> What's the suggested way to get the attribute instead?
[19:25:38] <Eviltwin> And will this hook be removed at some point?
[19:48:23] <gnarf> Eviltwin: i suggest deleting the attrHook
[19:48:40] <gnarf> Eviltwin: if you know nothing uses .attr("value") wrongly
[19:49:11] <gnarf> Eviltwin: otherwise, you could easily write a attrHook for realValue to return / set this.value
[19:49:12] <Eviltwin> That's why I did
[19:49:18] <Eviltwin> For my code
[19:49:26] <Eviltwin> I was wondering for the future of jQuery
[19:49:37] <gnarf> Eviltwin: undecided at the moment
[19:49:58] <Eviltwin> That's what I did*
[19:50:01] <gnarf> Eviltwin: timmywil prolly knows the most about it
[19:52:40] <gnarf> i personally think those particular attrHooks might become part of a "back compat" plugin
[19:52:47] <gnarf> there has been talk of that
[19:54:35] <Eviltwin> I was trying to use .val() == .attr("value") to check if a form field had been changed
[19:54:58] <Eviltwin> When it wasn't working I started to skim the .attr source and saw the attrHooks
[19:56:28] <gnarf> Eviltwin: I kinda hate it being there
[19:56:33] <gnarf> but so much bad code
[19:56:35] <gnarf> :)
[19:56:40] <Eviltwin> Yeah, I know how you feel
[19:56:53] <gnarf> attr/prop made some very bad practices
[19:57:15] <gnarf> i love the separation now
[19:57:21] <gnarf> thanks timmywil
[19:57:40] <gnarf> there are actually a bunch of them that had to be hacked into being BC because so many plugins use them
[19:57:41] <Eviltwin> It's nice when attr fetches attributes and prop fetches properties :D
[19:58:15] <gnarf> mostly because they didn't have a prop()
[19:58:24] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[19:59:39] <Eviltwin> I don't see that hook clearly documented on the .attr page
[19:59:43] <Eviltwin> Maybe I'm just overlooking it
[20:00:45] <gnarf> Eviltwin: if you have a suggestion for a change to the docs, please make it :)
[20:01:58] <Eviltwin> I don't actually know how to :)
[20:02:25] <gnarf> Eviltwin: myself and a few other lurkers here can edit the docs
[20:02:31] <gnarf> for now its in wordpress
[20:02:39] <gnarf> someday soon, i can share github url for ya
[20:02:40] <gnarf> :)
[20:03:55] <gnarf> actually this might just be an issue
[20:08:05] <gnarf> ?tell kswedberg Hey Karl! - What do we need to do to document jQuery.attrHooks ?  Eviltwin brought up the point that there is no documentation for it. I could write up a brief overview of the hooks, as well as the default defined ones but don't wanna duplicate any works in progress...
[20:08:05] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[20:08:33] <gnarf> Eviltwin: thanks :)
[20:08:41] <Eviltwin> No problem
[20:10:22] <Eviltwin> One other thing I thought of that I don't think is documented is .toggle(fn1, fn2, [..., fnN])
[20:11:05] <Eviltwin> Where you can cycle a series of functions on click
[20:16:13] <gnarf> ?toggle
[20:16:14] <bot-t> .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[20:17:06] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[20:17:17] <Eviltwin> Oh, huh
[20:17:28] <Eviltwin> That link's broken there then
[20:17:51] <gnarf> ?tell kswedberg http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/ vs http://api.jquery.com/toggle/ -- might want to link from one to the other somehow
[20:17:51] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[20:18:03] <gnarf> Eviltwin: bot-t has a REALLY old copy of the api xml
[20:18:30] <Eviltwin> I also need to build up my bot-t-fu
[20:30:56] <mikesherov> .
[20:51:49] <gnarf> ?tell mikesherov I just want you to have a message this time -- <3
[20:51:49] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[21:00:58] <snover> gnarf: hahaha I was thinking about doing that
[21:01:11] <snover> also telling him that he can message bot-t directly to get messages…
[23:21:43] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Just FYI, I'm taking today as a 100% TestSwarm day (8h give or take).
[23:21:44] <bot-t> (17 hours 50 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell krinkle we're working hard to completely stop using docs.jquery.com over the next month or two.
[23:22:12] <Krinkle> ?help
[23:22:12] <bot-t> Get FREE A++ HELP - http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc
[23:23:54] <Krinkle> ?tell scott_gonzalez I figured as much, since it was still running MediaWiki 1.8 (2006!). But while it exists, I'd be happy to do a little cleaning up and keeping it up to date (assuming content is going to migrated from it in some way shape or form)
[23:23:55] <bot-t> Krinkle, Okay.
