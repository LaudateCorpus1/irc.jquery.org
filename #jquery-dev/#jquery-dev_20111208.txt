[05:23:47] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: did you see my PR for gnarf's animate thing?
[05:24:03] <DaveMethvin> not yet
[05:24:08] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: good morning by the way
[05:24:11] <DaveMethvin> izzit ready to go?
[05:24:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah hi!
[05:24:52] <mikesherov_> I was able to shave it down from 162 min+gzip impact to 119 min+gzip impact
[05:25:03] <mikesherov_> so if that means it's ready to go, then yes

[05:28:33] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (9h, 12m ago): 1.7 - adding a cssHooks[prop].expand for use by animate() - Fixes #8498
[05:28:33] <bot-t> (8 hours 47 mins ago) <rwaldron> tell mikesherov your handling of cssExpand = [ "Top", "Right", "Bottom", "Left" ], to replace the other two arrays is killer. brings a tear of joy to my eye
[05:28:57] <mikesherov> lol
[05:32:01] <mikesherov_> bot-t: tell rwaldron that I thought up the solution while I was driving in my car, and I nearly killed myself rushing home to make the change (RE: cssExpand)
[05:32:02] <bot-t> mikesherov_, Okay.
[05:32:14] <mikesherov_> geez, my internet on the train has been terrible the past two days
[07:29:02] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[07:29:03] <bot-t> (1 hour 57 mins ago) <mikesherov_> tell rwaldron that I thought up the solution while I was driving in my car, and I nearly killed myself rushing home to make the change (RE: cssExpand)
[07:34:43] <gibson042> .
[07:36:11] <timmywil> rwaldron: hey
[07:36:11] <bot-t> (14 hours 40 mins ago) <tbranyen> tell timmywil lol, nitpicking the readability has been done to death in backbone, good luck if you can convince changes :-p
[07:36:36] <timmywil> ha
[07:37:25] <rwaldron> hey dude
[07:37:38] <rwaldron> saw your comment on that ticket from twitter
[07:37:43] <rwaldron> thanks for that
[07:37:47] <rwaldron> should we just close it?
[07:37:54] <rwaldron> duplicate?
[07:38:08] <timmywil> it's very related, but not quite a duplicate
[07:38:14] <timmywil> i think dave already closed it tho
[07:41:06] <timmywil> the ticket I linked to was about $('a:not([href])').  In ie6/7, it will still select all hrefs because .getAttribute('href', 2) always returns a string.  The one from twitter is also an issue concerning .getAttribute('href',2), which is getting the right thing, but the href has already been munged by setting with innerHTML.  It was just another reason that the former ticket is wontfix.
[08:56:48] <gnarf> yeah mikesherov = epic DRY

[10:21:36] <DaveMethvin> cool mikesherov i'll do another round of updates tonight, or timmywil if you want
[10:24:45] <mikesherov> np
[10:26:25] <timmywil> we should remove src/selector.js
[10:26:29] <timmywil> from the make
[10:27:40] <mikesherov> oh, you mean for JSHint?
[10:27:48] <timmywil> from everywhere
[10:27:55] <mikesherov> yeah
[11:26:55] <gibson042> timmywil: how do I pull mikesherov:1.7-cssHooks-expand into gibson042/jquery?
[11:29:13] <rwaldron> git cob 1.7-cssHooks-expand && git pull https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery 1.7-cssHooks-expand
[11:29:18] <rwaldron> whoops
[11:29:26] <rwaldron> git checkout -b 1.7-cssHooks-expand && git pull https://github.com/mikesherov/jquery 1.7-cssHooks-expand
[11:29:30] <rwaldron> sorry about that.
[11:29:35] <rwaldron> gibson042 ^
[11:30:25] <gibson042> and that'll copy the branch under my fork?
[11:34:11] <gibson042> rwaldron
[11:36:57] <rwaldron> locally
[11:37:02] <rwaldron> and then when you're done
[11:37:12] <rwaldron> git push origin 1.7-cssHooks-expand
[11:37:16] <gibson042> thanks, that's exactly what I need
[11:37:21] <rwaldron> and it will appear on your github account
[11:37:34] <rwaldron> you can then make a pull request directly to mikesherov :)
[11:39:11] <gibson042> even better
[11:39:13] <gibson042> thank you
[11:39:14] <timmywil> well, you'd have to fork mike's to do a pull request on his
[11:39:26] <gibson042> ?
[11:39:42] <timmywil> is there a way?
[11:40:00] <timmywil> oh nvm, you can
[11:40:07] <timmywil> gibson042: sry for confusion
[11:40:23] <gibson042> because we're dealing with two independent forks of the same project, right?
[11:40:40] <timmywil> yea, id didn't think github did pull requests on other forks, but they do
[11:40:46] <gibson042> ok
[11:53:15] <gnarf> as long as you both forked the same project you can send a pull request to mikes repo
[11:53:46] <gnarf> its kinda a pain tho
[11:53:59] <gnarf> you have to like hack the compare / pull url manually to get it to work
[11:54:30] <gnarf> https://github.com/yourname/jquery/compare/mikesherov:branchname...yourbranchname
[11:54:48] <gnarf> and i dont remember if you want the original left or right, but i think its left
[11:54:56] <gnarf> then the "pull request" button will send mike a pull :)
[12:15:07] <gibson042> gnarf: how do I see compares without URL manipulation?
[12:15:30] <gnarf> i dunno if there is a ui for cross repo diffs
[12:15:55] <gnarf> i just do it with the urls
[12:16:23] <gibson042> how about not cross-repo?
[12:18:03] <rwaldron> timmywil that's the instructions i gave him
[12:18:13] <rwaldron> to pull from mike's branch
[12:18:23] <rwaldron> you dont need a fork-of
[12:18:34] <timmywil> yea i thought you did
[12:18:41] <eddiemonge> ben_alman: you around?
[12:18:45] <rwaldron> what the effff
[12:18:54] <rwaldron> sorry, i didnt see the gnarf replied already
[12:19:00] <rwaldron> excuse the echo
[12:19:09] <rwaldron> eddiemonge he's on vaca
[12:19:19] <eddiemonge> oh
[12:19:23] <gnarf> gibson042: use reponame:branch as an endpoint of a diff
[12:19:45] <gnarf> in the compare url
[12:20:41] <gibson042> PR created with the URL hacking
[12:21:39] <gibson042> now I'm asking for steps to get to *any* diff through the github UI so I can recreate this process in the future
[12:21:56] <gibson042> all the URLs I see end in changeset hashes
[12:22:40] <eddiemonge> master will be all releases. So bug fixes go in there and can be released as 1.x.x+1. New features or major changes will be developed in branches until they are feature complete. when they are ready, merge them into master and release as 1.x+1.x
[12:22:51] <eddiemonge> is that how the master/branches work?
[12:31:35] <rwaldron> gnarf gibson042 one of the students i work with on Popcorn created a compare bookmarklet
[12:32:59] <rwaldron> gnarf gibson042 http://www.chrisdecairos.ca/projects/CompareMarklet/
[12:49:42] <rwaldron> timmywil i'm really tempted to reply to chad and correct is his incorrect use of "array syntax"
[12:50:06] <rwaldron> "blah blah blah dotted syntax blah blah blah array syntax"
[12:50:38] <rwaldron> oh, I'm sorry, do you mean "dot notation" and "bracket notation"? >:|
[12:51:49] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin would probably follow it up with an email telling me to go sit in a corner :P
[12:52:09] <gnarf> sit in a corner and scope some binding forms
[12:52:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah cut the poor guy a break!
[12:52:44] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i was advised by a google engineer to send that email
[12:53:01] <DaveMethvin> i can just imagine the closure compiler in a smoldering heap after trying to compile jQuery
[12:53:10] <rwaldron> and you basically pants-ed me in front of the whole class,
[12:54:00] <DaveMethvin> right now i just want him to see if it's doable, we can clean up the mess later
[12:54:37] <DaveMethvin> i loled when i saw that google and jquery have like polar opposite coding standards
[12:54:49] <DaveMethvin> SPACES? YOU USE SPACES?
[12:55:02] <rwaldron> Fact: jQuery has greater developer mindshare
[12:55:14] <rwaldron> Fact: 2 people use Google Closure Library
[12:55:23] <rwaldron> ok, so not so much "fact"...
[12:55:53] <gnarf> is that like the episode of psych where he keeps saying "fact" ? :)
[12:56:43] <DaveMethvin> i prefer the "False" meme
[12:56:45] <rwaldron> maybe
[12:56:51] <rwaldron> Confirm.
[12:56:58] <DaveMethvin> hah
[12:57:51] <rwaldron> ahahah
[12:57:56] <rwaldron> he still fixed all those quotes

[12:58:53] <rwaldron> so?
[12:58:57] <timmywil> EXACTLY
[12:59:01] <timmywil> sobs
[12:59:16] <timmywil> that's SOBs ;)
[12:59:17] <rwaldron> i have a script that does conversion for me
[12:59:27] <rwaldron> i no longer worry about it
[12:59:33] <timmywil> yea, it's easy to change
[12:59:34] <rwaldron> i use tabs in the editor

[13:01:40] <rwaldron> This is the difference between devs that are paid for code maintenance
[13:01:48] <rwaldron> and devs that volunteer
[13:02:46] <rwaldron> https://github.com/ChadKillingsworth/jquery/tree/closure-compiler/test/closure-compiler
[13:02:55] <rwaldron> there are now 3 different test suites to maintain
[13:03:05] <rwaldron> i really hope this works out!
[13:03:12] * rwaldron shudders
[13:06:00] <timmywil> why is he changing unit tests? just to be consistent?
[13:08:23] <timmywil> we don't need to compile test scripts
[13:10:48] <timmywil> nvm, not all of it is like the first change i saw
[15:13:50] <johnbender> hey guys, we're working on a builder and we're using module definitions
[15:14:09] <johnbender> I was hoping to get a sanity check from you guys as far as "endorsing" the module definitions in the code base
[15:14:25] <johnbender> is there anyone in particular who would like to take part in the discussioni?
[15:14:34] <johnbender> s/discussioni/discussion/
[15:14:56] <johnbender> it'll probably be an email thread
[15:18:21] <timmywil> I wouldn't mind being on that thread. timmywillisn@gmail.com
[15:20:41] <rpflo> "We’ve pared down the submission and maintenance process to a single, one-time step: adding a post-receive hook"
[15:20:43] * rpflo claps
[15:20:47] <rpflo> that's awesome
[15:22:54] <ajpiano> rpflo: :D
[15:23:03] <rpflo> also, when are you resigning?
[15:23:06] <ajpiano> rworth and scott_gonzalez have done most of the engineering
[15:23:10] <rpflo> because seriously, intolerable.
[15:23:12] <ajpiano> so kudos tho them
[15:23:21] <ajpiano> rpflo: i'm gonna negotiate a lucrative severance package
[15:23:36] <rpflo> as a non-member of the jQuery core team, I'm firing you.
[15:23:37] <ajpiano> cause not only does jquery have infinite people resources, it also has infinite monetary resources

[16:05:18] <mikesherov> timmywil: coming or going?
[16:09:52] <mikesherov> there he is
[16:09:59] <mikesherov> tmmywil: stay a while
[16:10:07] <mikesherov> timmywil: stay a while
[16:10:23] <timmywil> dunno what's up :P
[16:13:55] <mikesherov> no, just saw your multiple login logouts
[16:14:13] <mikesherov> but I did want to ask you about removing selector from the JSHint check?
[16:14:20] <mikesherov> selector.js?
[16:16:25] <timmywil> yea, we don't really need it anymore
[16:19:55] <mikesherov> not sure how to specifically do that, because the minifier needs it though, right?
[16:20:17] <mikesherov> and the unit tests too?
[16:23:26] <timmywil> it's just a concatenation of sizzle and sizzle-jquery
[16:24:11] <timmywil> the makefile still uses it, but we don't use it in the tests anymore
[16:26:34] <mikesherov> so, should it remain in the makefile? I mean, the JSHint checks runs on dist/jquery.js
[16:27:27] <mikesherov> are you saying to replace all the places of selector.js with sizzle/sizzle.js and sizzle-jquery.js ?
[16:28:25] <timmywil> yea, that's the suggestion
[16:28:26] <mikesherov> If so, that makes sense
[16:28:54] <mikesherov> I was thinking you were saying get rid of all that code completely in the build process since it's a submodule
[16:28:57] <mikesherov> so nevermind
[16:29:19] <mikesherov> my PR for JSHint on the sizzle repo still stands then :-)

[16:32:25] <mikesherov> I need that merged to continue working on my box model stuff
[16:32:44] <DaveMethvin> k, sounds good
[16:32:51] <mikesherov> or if not merging it tonight, at least some indication of the likelihood it will be merged
[16:33:08] <DaveMethvin> i've been busy w a bunch of other stuff but should be able to spend a couple of hours tonight
[16:33:16] <mikesherov> k, no pressure
[16:33:39] <DaveMethvin> we might as well land this stuff, no reason for the pull q to back up again
[16:33:51] <DaveMethvin> is the jshint one ready to go as well?
[16:34:50] <mikesherov> Yeah, JSHint is ready
[16:35:04] <mikesherov> timmywil mentioned he wanted to look over it too
[16:35:21] <DaveMethvin> k i'll start with 626
[16:35:22] <mikesherov> at the least it need to be merged along with the corresponding PR on Sizzle
[16:35:43] <mikesherov> but I think timmywil mostly wanted to look at it when it still did undef
[16:35:54] <mikesherov> timmywil: please verify
[16:36:12] <timmywil> no, i don't think we should do undef right now
[16:36:12] <mikesherov> OK, I'll be around if you have some questions
[16:36:17] <mikesherov> right, I didn't
[16:36:22] <mikesherov> I have the PR without undef
[16:36:30] <DaveMethvin> so it's just the switch to jshint, basically?
[16:36:33] <mikesherov> yes
[16:36:48] <mikesherov> plus style changes and /*falls through*/ on sizzle
[16:36:55] <DaveMethvin> yep
[16:37:34] <mikesherov> K, I'll be back in about 25 minutes

[17:23:30] <danzik17> mikesherov: ill test the others real quick, but i know trailing would need to be switched on.  i think if you define your own settings object, things default to false  ( built an MSBuilt task for jshint earlier so i ran into that )

[17:33:42] <danzik17> mikesherov mikesherov_ :  yup, pure defaults don't catch curly, trailing, or eqeqeq - just tested it
[17:35:03] <mikesherov_> danzik17: so you're saying I should add those in
[17:35:09] <mikesherov_> Good idea
[17:35:17] <danzik17> mikesherov_: pretty much
[17:35:32] <mikesherov_> eqeqeq plays nice with eqnull?
[17:36:01] <danzik17> yes - the docs explicitly reference that case.  long as eqnull === true, you'll get the behavior i know u want
[17:36:45] <mikesherov_> OK, great
[17:36:50] <mikesherov_> I'll add those in
[17:37:08] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: can you wait like 10 minutes on the JSHint PR?

[17:49:08] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: can you wait like 10 minutes on the JSHint PR?
[17:49:29] <mikesherov_> danzik wants me to include some other config options:
[17:49:44] <mikesherov_> curly, trailing, eqeqeq
[17:49:46] <DaveMethvin> i've got it pretty much ready, can you just tell me what to change?
[17:51:01] <mikesherov_> k
[17:51:09] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: can i just edit those options in?
[17:51:17] <mikesherov_> yes
[17:51:21] <mikesherov_> curly: true
[17:51:37] <mikesherov_> eqeqeq: true
[17:51:52] <mikesherov_> trailing: true
[17:52:01] <mikesherov_> that's it
[17:52:13] <mikesherov_> danzik: those can be made straight away, right?
[17:52:54] <DaveMethvin> haha trailing catches a lotta stuff
[17:53:22] <DaveMethvin> also, i need to add the falls through, can i be lazy and ask you the exact syntax for that? /* falls through */ doesnt seem to be it
[17:53:23] <danzik17> DaveMethvin: yea....thatll help you enforce styleguide going forward =P
[17:53:52] <mikesherov_> Dave, the falls through is on sizzle
[17:54:06] <danzik17> mikesherov_: yes, they can be straight added - you might want to go thru the rest of the jshint options and see what else you might want.  i was just pretty solid that you'd want those 3.
[17:54:11] <mikesherov_> hmmm, eqeqeq also can't be true yet
[17:54:21] <DaveMethvin> oh that's right, gotta get that coordinated
[17:54:21] <mikesherov_> it catches some stuff too
[17:54:42] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: do the PR without those options
[17:54:53] <mikesherov_> danzik17: I'll add those options in another PR
[17:55:17] <DaveMethvin> the only one causing issues is trailing, i can fix those now
[17:55:35] <DaveMethvin> plus the ones from sizzle
[17:55:38] <danzik17> mikesherov_: thats fine, just wanted it on the radar so someone else knew about it.
[17:55:49] <mikesherov_> eqeqeq true causes problems too
[17:56:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah we don't have that one yet
[17:56:21] <mikesherov_> right
[17:56:35] <danzik17> you didnt have that enforced in jslint?
[17:56:45] <mikesherov_> so you can do curly:true and trailing: true if you feel like picking those out
[17:56:51] <mikesherov_> danzik17: no, we didn't
[17:57:18] <mikesherov_> because there is no eqnull in JSLint
[17:57:22] <mikesherov_> so we had to blanket ignore strict equals
[17:57:29] <danzik17> ah i see
[17:59:56] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: funnily enough, the first error for eqeqeq is the new isWindow check! LOL
[18:00:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i hope there's an override...
[18:00:44] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov_ you'll need to update  the sizzle pull to match the options
[18:00:59] <DaveMethvin> quite a few whitespace issues
[18:01:26] <mikesherov_> OK, I can do that, or we can go without danzik17's options for now and add those in later
[18:01:38] <mikesherov_> I'm just ready to land this sucker
[18:03:09] <DaveMethvin> i feel like going for broke, let's put in the curly whitespace and eqeq
[18:03:25] <mikesherov_> ok then
[18:03:43] <DaveMethvin> we can always back it out if it becomes too annoying
[18:03:49] <mikesherov_> ok
[18:03:49] <danzik17> dont know if you can ignore a single instance of an error though ( for your isWindow check )
[18:04:53] <mikesherov_> I don't think we can
[18:04:59] <gnarf> i think its a planned feature
[18:05:02] <mikesherov_> the eqeqeq seems dangerous
[18:05:17] <gnarf> other than the window check, are there other errors?
[18:05:30] <mikesherov_> yes
[18:05:34] <gnarf> cuz obj === obj.window isn't true on some windows :/ (namely ie)

[18:05:43] <DaveMethvin> boom!
[18:05:48] <mikesherov_> YEAH!
[18:05:52] <danzik17> leave eqeqeq out imo and just do it later - it hasnt been enabled in jslint for how long and you survived
[18:07:12] <mikesherov_> so what, we ned to fix Sizzle now?
[18:07:26] <danzik17> DaveMethvin: if you wanna go for it....the option is "eqeqeq" not "eqeq" =P
[18:07:48] <DaveMethvin> well no wonder it didn't hurt!
[18:08:02] <mikesherov_> hahaha
[18:08:14] <DaveMethvin> well that saves some typing when we want to enable it :P
[18:08:15] <danzik17> it wasn't long enough.  it'll hurt more now.
[18:08:30] <mikesherov_> ok, leave it off
[18:08:36] <mikesherov_> it's a big unsafe change
[18:08:46] <mikesherov_> we'll handle it soon after major testing
[18:08:49] <gnarf> did u see my comment on that comit?
[18:08:55] <mikesherov_> it's bigger than undef if you ask me
[18:09:05] <DaveMethvin> i saw it gnarf
[18:10:04] <mikesherov_> ok, let's back out eqeq and gnarf's comment
[18:10:23] <mikesherov_> I gotta go, hit me up on github if you need me

[18:44:49] <DaveMethvin> gotta keep you guys entertained... :D
[18:46:11] <mikesherov> ok, so now I can delete almost all my branches
[18:46:11] <mikesherov> LOL
[18:46:42] <mikesherov> hopefully, I'll have a new PR for the boxSizing stuff
[18:47:23] <mikesherov> but remember that other PR for jQuery.boxModel that I said needed fixing up
[18:47:32] <mikesherov> It's probably OK on it's own
[18:47:42] <DaveMethvin> is it worth landing by itself though?
[18:47:50] <mikesherov> I think so
[18:47:55] <mikesherov> it's definitely a fix
[18:48:24] <mikesherov> and nothing I can add can make it better
[18:48:29] <DaveMethvin> it just fixes the case of having div { box-sizing: .. } and mainly fools us into thinking we are in quirks mode which we don't support anyway
[18:48:51] <mikesherov> well no
[18:49:09] <rick-_> DaveMethvin while you're landing...

[18:49:25] <rwaldron> legit
[18:49:39] <mikesherov> it was a fix for div { padding: 5px}
[18:49:39] <DaveMethvin> i had a q about that one, just a sec
[18:49:47] <rwaldron> sure thing
[18:51:48] <sizcommit> [sizzle] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/1oB2lg

[18:53:46] <rwaldron> oh man...
[18:53:54] <rwaldron> our jshint needs some love
[18:53:58] <rwaldron> those errors are atrocious
[18:54:12] <DaveMethvin> the sizzle commit should fix it
[18:54:25] <mikesherov> yeah
[18:54:26] <rwaldron> still, the error formatting is useless
[18:54:27] <DaveMethvin> there were a LOT of spacing issues with it
[18:54:35] <rwaldron> not surprised.
[18:54:38] <gnarf> once you push that sizzle to jQuery that is
[18:55:59] <rwaldron> why the hell do i have untracked or modified content in submodules?
[18:56:28] <gnarf> did you just pull sizzle?
[18:56:42] <gnarf> cuz DaveMethvin hasn't pushed the jQuery repo commit to tell it to use that new sizzle
[18:57:14] <rwaldron> oic
[18:57:21] <rwaldron> i ran update_submodules and its cool now
[18:57:32] <gnarf> so you're "ahead" of jquery/master
[18:57:50] <rwaldron> $ git st
[18:57:50] <rwaldron> # On branch master
[18:57:50] <rwaldron> nothing to commit (working directory clean)
[18:57:50] <mikesherov> yup
[18:58:54] <DaveMethvin> ok, so now I need to update the submodules...never done that
[19:00:19] <DaveMethvin> soooo gnarf
[19:00:30] <mikesherov> lol
[19:00:42] <DaveMethvin> hey, there's a first time for everything
[19:00:51] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: git add submodule ; git commit - m "Updating to sizzle/master" ; git push
[19:01:16] <gnarf> you add the submodule (after you get it pointing at the right commit ;) )
[19:01:43] <rwaldron> Rose made this awesome chili two nights ago
[19:01:51] <rwaldron> i was looking forward to eating left overs for dinner
[19:01:59] <gnarf> you're basically adding that SHA for the submodule to the staged commit
[19:02:05] <rwaldron> turns out she took it to her friends' place
[19:02:06] <rwaldron> wtf.
[19:03:10] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, yeah it's the process for adding the sha that isnt' clear to me
[19:03:58] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: treat the directory like a file you modified
[19:04:11] <gnarf> git add sizzle ; git commit -m "updating sizzle/master"; git push
[19:04:12] <gnarf> done
[19:04:22] <gnarf> i dont remeber the exact directory
[19:04:29] <DaveMethvin> oh the one inside jquery?
[19:04:33] <gnarf> yeah
[19:04:42] <gnarf> checkout whichever sha you need from sizzle
[19:04:44] <mikesherov> after you do make update_submodules
[19:04:57] <mikesherov> then do git add sizzle;
[19:05:09] <mikesherov> git add src/sizzle;
[19:05:09] <gnarf> like git checkout master ; git pull ; cd .. ; git add sizzle ; git commit -m "yo yo yo"
[19:05:23] <gnarf> and update_submodules is unneeded
[19:05:47] <gnarf> all that does I think is a) clone it if it doesn't exist, b) updates to whatever SHA is stored in the commit
[19:06:51] <DaveMethvin> ok so src/sizzle is there
[19:07:03] <DaveMethvin> now, how do i tell jquery which sha to use?
[19:07:18] <DaveMethvin> i mean, am i overthinking this?
[19:07:19] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i need to take Alli the dingo-fox for a walk, ill be back shortly to discuss that PR

[19:16:17] <rwaldron> nice
[19:17:18] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron how long does your dog go before s/he needs to go out again?
[19:17:25] <DaveMethvin> was that it for the night?
[19:17:40] <DaveMethvin> or are they actually smart enough to tell you they need to pee
[19:17:42] <rwaldron> I'll probably take her out one more time
[19:17:58] <DaveMethvin> my dog would just find a corner if we didn't take him out
[19:18:07] <mikesherov> awesome DaveMethvin
[19:18:17] <rwaldron> ohhhh... i see..
[19:18:18] <DaveMethvin> but he'd hate to waste perfectly good urine that way

[19:24:25] <DaveMethvin> it has to be in the tix closed in the past week
[19:25:13] <mikesherov> yeah
[19:27:59] <DaveMethvin> Here's the original ticket, but no link to the pull: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/5520
[19:28:13] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin are you using actual node now?
[19:28:20] <rwaldron> with full npm support?
[19:28:25] <rwaldron> (not just the standalone)
[19:28:29] <DaveMethvin> it's like 0.4
[19:28:43] <rwaldron> but the real windows node right?
[19:28:57] <DaveMethvin> is there a really fresh one?
[19:29:04] <rwaldron> maybe?
[19:29:11] <rwaldron> dont worry about it
[19:29:21] <DaveMethvin> i had problems getting 0.5 to work
[19:29:25] <rwaldron> i wanted to colorize the errors
[19:29:28] <DaveMethvin> npm works with 0.4
[19:29:30] <rwaldron> no big deal
[19:29:41] <DaveMethvin> i am hoping there is a recent one
[19:29:52] <rwaldron> i was using a weird standalone on windows before
[19:29:58] <DaveMethvin> node is cool and all but not all that stable afaict at least on windows
[19:30:43] <DaveMethvin> ya know, the search capabilites of github suck

[19:36:41] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by AaronAsAChimp (6m, 4d ago): FIx support.boxModel when padding or other styles are applied to div (#7986)
[19:36:45] <mikesherov> I think it's sound
[19:36:45] <rwaldron> !
[19:36:59] <rwaldron> btw, i found it by clicking "updated"
[19:37:02] <rwaldron> in the PR queue
[19:37:10] <mikesherov> hmm
[19:37:11] <rwaldron> sorts by lat updated-ness
[19:37:14] <rwaldron> last*
[19:37:18] <DaveMethvin> oh
[19:37:30] <DaveMethvin> that makes ... something
[19:38:59] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: can you just reopen that one so I can take a closer look
[19:39:06] <DaveMethvin> yep just did
[19:39:12] <mikesherov> gnarf: can you take a closer look at that one too
[19:39:36] <mikesherov> I mean, at the end of the day, support.boxModel's use in offset is just a proxy for IE7 and IE6
[19:39:50] <DaveMethvin> he did the commit on his master, ugh, so be prepared for pain
[19:40:06] <mikesherov> and this PR fixes the situation where you have DIV {padding:0px;} causing the boxModel to say it's not supported
[19:40:35] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: yeah i wondered why we didn't just use  the document mode var, i mentioned that in the ticket
[19:40:53] <mikesherov> So that's the other thing
[19:40:55] <DaveMethvin> i mean, it's documented so we could really use that instead of the feature detect
[19:40:56] <gnarf> heh opened another one for boxModel?
[19:41:18] <mikesherov> well, no, I wanted that other one reopened
[19:41:27] <mikesherov> the thing is that jQuery.boxModel was deprecated in 1.3
[19:41:28] <gnarf> i thought we weren't gonna pick that one up because we wanted to find a better approach
[19:41:35] <mikesherov> and I think it's time to remove it completely
[19:41:47] <mikesherov> those are unnecessary support tests we're doing
[19:42:04] <mikesherov> especially if it's only as a proxy for document mode
[19:42:14] <DaveMethvin> you mean the jQuery.boxModel, jQuery.support.boxModel, and support for quirks mode? (aka the Unholy Trinity)
[19:42:15] <mikesherov> CSS1Compat right?
[19:42:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:42:31] <mikesherov> well, let's not get rid of quirks mode support per se
[19:42:54] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure we are doing it right atm anyway
[19:43:03] <gnarf> well if you wanna remove boxModel - why are you supporting a pull that fixes it? :)
[19:43:05] <mikesherov> let's replace the jQuery.support.boxModel check in offset with CSS1Compat
[19:43:14] <mikesherov> I'm not
[19:43:24] <mikesherov> I'm saying we should re-examine it
[19:43:35] <mikesherov> keep it open so I can know where it is :-)
[19:43:37] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, the bigger problem is that the new css3 box-sizing stuff lets you go back to the quirks-mode box model
[19:43:51] <mikesherov> Well, DaveMethvin, no.
[19:44:14] <mikesherov> Even with other box-sizing's, with this PR, it would be fine
[19:44:32] <mikesherov> support.boxModel = div.offsetWidth === 3;
[19:44:39] <mikesherov> that line, checking for offsetWidth
[19:44:50] <mikesherov> offsetWidth is unaffected by boxSizing
[19:45:02] <mikesherov> so I was wrong in saying we needed to care about that
[19:45:13] <DaveMethvin> the way i understood it at least, if you say box-model:border-box (i think thats it) then it includes the padding/border in the css width?
[19:45:13] <mikesherov> specifically for the offset test
[19:45:22] <mikesherov> Dave, it does
[19:45:27] <mikesherov> but not in offsetWidth
[19:45:49] <mikesherov> offsetWidth, no matter the box-sizing is content-width + padding + border
[19:46:25] <DaveMethvin> so the only impact is in offset
[19:46:29] <mikesherov> it's just that box-sizing content-box has css width = content width, and box-sizing border-box has css width = offsetWidth
[19:46:42] <mikesherov> well, this PR fixes the impact in offset
[19:46:44] <mikesherov> right
[19:47:16] <mikesherov> the point being that if we can get rid of jquery.support.boxModel in offset, we can get rid of jQuery.boxModel in whole
[19:47:32] <DaveMethvin> which would be good
[19:47:43] <mikesherov> yes, considering it was done in 10413
[19:47:49] <mikesherov> oops
[19:48:03] <mikesherov> I mean, yes, it's good because jQuery.boxModel was deprecated in 1.3
[19:48:09] <mikesherov> removed in 1.8!
[19:48:38] <mikesherov> the other larger point being that it has nothing to do with my fixes for 10413
[19:48:43] <DaveMethvin> it's more of a prob that every time we want to remove a jQuery.support test we are potentially breaking user code b/c of the fact we documented it
[19:49:05] <mikesherov> well, we don't need to remove it fine
[19:49:10] <mikesherov> but we won't have to fix it either
[19:49:46] <mikesherov> and if we can remove the check for it from offset, it fixes that bug without having to fix the support test
[19:49:49] <DaveMethvin> ok so imma leave soon, any other damage I can do tonight?
[19:49:57] <mikesherov> Nope
[19:50:03] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to ask rwaldron about that commit
[19:50:04] <mikesherov> I'll let 406 stew for a bit
[19:50:08] <DaveMethvin> sure
[19:50:11] <rwaldron> yo yo yo
[19:50:32] <rwaldron> gzipped difference: 0 bytes
[19:50:32] <DaveMethvin> there was one other tidbit from rkatic in that commit
[19:50:36] <DaveMethvin> pull er
[19:50:56] <DaveMethvin> remember we had like a typeof==="object" && isArray()
[19:51:06] <DaveMethvin> lemme see if i can find the code
[19:51:08] <rwaldron> he meant above
[19:51:12] <DaveMethvin> right
[19:51:25] <rwaldron> thing is... that's a different change
[19:51:35] <rwaldron> this actually had a testable benefit
[19:51:41] <rwaldron> something that could be proven
[19:51:55] <rwaldron> eg. userland constructed objects
[19:52:17] <DaveMethvin> it's not a big deal i can land it, but i am not sure why ppl would be sending constructed object to serialize them
[19:52:33] <rwaldron> nor am i
[19:52:35] <rwaldron> BUT
[19:52:47] <rwaldron> if he mentioned it, there is probably code and porn about it
[19:53:06] <DaveMethvin> if it was +1 i'd throw your ass out :D
[19:53:19] <rwaldron> if it was +1 I wouldn't have bothered
[19:53:29] <rwaldron> :D
