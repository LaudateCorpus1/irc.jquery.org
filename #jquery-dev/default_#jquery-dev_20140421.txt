[09:45:48] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: jzaefferer and I have been playing around with Trac configs and we haven't gotten spam in a while.
[09:46:20] <DaveMethvin> ours was pretty good but the last couple of weeks have been a problem
[09:46:51] <DaveMethvin> some scripts are generating a bunch of logins as well, i delete them but they come back within a day
[09:46:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's gotten pretty bad.
[09:52:58] <snover> why donâ€™t you just ask nicely for them to stop

[11:22:34] <ben_alman> is there an easy-to-setup app i can run from within the jquery project to create the php webserver it needs to pass all the unit tests?
[11:45:48] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: the easiest formal way is in the README, it would be nice if someone set up a VM and you could use vagrant or something
[11:57:05] <ben_alman> oh i missed in the readme
[11:57:07] <ben_alman> let me check again
[11:58:21] <ben_alman> christ mongoose was easy
[11:58:22] <ben_alman> lol
[12:00:06] <ben_alman> hmmnâ€¦ lots of 500s
[12:00:27] <ben_alman> CGI program sent malformed or too big (>16384 bytes) HTTP headers: [spawn_process: execle(dont_return.php): Permission denied
[12:01:37] <DaveMethvin> i just did this over the weekend, it was basically apt-get install apache2 and a few other things and it worked
[12:02:08] <ben_alman> yeah i just installed mongoose but am getting that error
[12:02:18] <ben_alman> i'm doing a presentation and wanted to show off grunt in jquery
[12:02:44] <DaveMethvin> well mongoose must not like something we're doing
[12:02:49] <ben_alman> hmmn
[12:02:51] <DaveMethvin> but i dunno
[12:02:55] <ben_alman> yeah i hear ya
[12:03:05] <DaveMethvin> i think it says to use apache doesn't it?
[12:03:19] <DaveMethvin> i wish we didn't have any server deps but it's hard to do that for the ajax stuff
[12:03:21] <ben_alman> no it lists 4 options
[12:03:24] <ben_alman> mongoose is one of them
[12:03:32] <ben_alman> https://github.com/jquery/jquery#running-the-unit-tests
[12:03:37] <DaveMethvin> i've never taken that route
[12:04:02] <DaveMethvin> if you skip the ajax tests it may finish
[12:30:06] <ben_alman> yeah, it's timing out randomly
[12:30:18] <ben_alman> any ide who uses mongoose around here anyways?
[12:30:24] <ben_alman> maybe it should be taken off the list
[12:30:36] <DaveMethvin> i've never installed it, not sure who put it on the list
[12:30:48] <DaveMethvin> it works for apache and ngnix
[12:30:54] <ben_alman> yeah
[12:37:17] <ben_alman> ok trying with mamp this time
[12:43:34] <ben_alman> ok, i give up
[12:43:39] <ben_alman> thx anyways DaveMethvin 
[12:43:59] <DaveMethvin> sorry, that's strange
[12:44:18] <DaveMethvin> i was surprised i got it running so easy this weekend tbh
[12:44:30] <DaveMethvin> didn't even follow the instructions, just installed apache2 and php
[12:48:49] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: since i know you've looked at this lately I will ask
[12:49:09] <DaveMethvin> about the problem with "CR being replaced by CRLF"
[12:49:21] <DaveMethvin> getting that while testing out the release
[12:49:41] <DaveMethvin> http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/5460e0.png
[12:51:13] <DaveMethvin> oh they must already be committed that way? http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/69e19c.png
[12:51:41] <DaveMethvin> how do i find out the CRLF-ication status of a committed file?
[12:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Does adding __release to .gitignore make that go away?
[12:55:10] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't normalize the CDN. I figured we probably shouldn't change files that we've already published.
[12:55:10] <DaveMethvin> i can try that
[12:55:25] <scott_gonzalez> Not that it would really matter. And they wouldn't get re-read from the source anyway.
[12:56:32] <DaveMethvin> well the screen shot seems to be saying bower.json has CRLF in the repo
[12:56:38] <DaveMethvin> which ignoring won't help
[12:56:48] <DaveMethvin> but it shouldn't have CRLF in the repo :)
[12:56:55] <DaveMethvin> or package.json for that matter
[12:58:16] <DaveMethvin> but in this case it seems to be saying the repo is set to always use CRLF because I just created the RC2 file
[12:58:20] <DaveMethvin> http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/5460e0.png
[12:58:47] <DaveMethvin> but i guess when it's checked out into the CDN it's got LF only because it's a Unix/Linux box with LF native
[13:00:02] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..yeah, I wonder why it's saying that it'll convert it to CRLF since we have `*.js eol=lf`
[13:00:06] <DaveMethvin> so i'm still stumped
[13:00:58] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, maybe because codeorigin doesn't have a .gitattributes, so it's reading your global git config?
[13:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> And that's telling it to use auto?
[13:01:16] <DaveMethvin> ah let me check that
[13:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> We could add .gitattributes to codeorigin. I don't think it'd cause any problems.
[13:02:24] <DaveMethvin> yep, that was it
[13:02:31] <DaveMethvin> that's some good detective work there, Lou
[13:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:02:42] <scott_gonzalez> So how do you want to proceed?
[13:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> Should we just add the .gitattributes to the CDN?
[13:02:58] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure why i had autocrlf there tbh
[13:03:12] <DaveMethvin> this is on the Debian VM i just set up
[13:03:21] <DaveMethvin> but i copied over some config files
[13:03:32] <DaveMethvin> let me check on my host
[13:04:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's on there
[13:04:56] <DaveMethvin> bc thats what github says to do https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings
[13:05:06] <DaveMethvin> and i'm not sure I agree
[13:05:46] <DaveMethvin> seems like adding .gitattributes to the CDN would be a good safety measure
[13:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> Try doing that and see what happens.
[13:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing there will be a few files that get modified, but that should be fine.
[13:07:49] <DaveMethvin> existing files shouldn't be hurt
[13:08:01] <DaveMethvin> *.js  eol=lf right?
[13:08:30] <DaveMethvin> oh i guess i need to do the fakecdn too
[13:09:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, just copy the .gitattributes from any other project.
[13:11:24] <DaveMethvin> text=auto .. is that safe for zip files and the like that will go on the cdn?
[13:11:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'd think so.
[13:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> I would certainly hope git knows that zip files are raw text.
[13:12:17] <scott_gonzalez> *aren't
[13:12:40] <DaveMethvin> well i'll see if it fixes this issue at least
[13:14:56] <DaveMethvin> oh darn, gotta reset my repo
[13:17:33] <DaveMethvin> maybe jquery 1.4.2 doesn't exist
[13:17:40] <DaveMethvin> it was all a dream
[13:18:18] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:18:59] <DaveMethvin> yes, much quieter
[13:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> How to submit a patch for jQuery
[13:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> 1. Buy a mac or install linux
[13:20:12] <DaveMethvin> just about
[13:28:06] <arschmitz> i started on a pc
[13:28:13] <arschmitz> so much easier once i switch to a mac
[13:28:36] <DaveMethvin> aw cmon, i'm on a pc now and it works fine
[13:28:44] <DaveMethvin> since i'm running a Debian vm :)
[13:28:52] <arschmitz> lol

[13:29:06] <jqcommit> 13jquery/062.1.1-rc2 14c2fdcaa 15Dave Methvin: 2.1.1-rc2
[13:29:18] <DaveMethvin> now that there's some real work
[13:29:59] <DaveMethvin> cloning the cdn ... ugh
[13:30:21] <DaveMethvin> it's all those mobile and ui themes clogging things up
[13:30:38] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: we only have one theme on mobile
[13:30:48] <arschmitz> :)
[13:30:50] <DaveMethvin> BIG
[13:31:28] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: you would think we put images in our repos or something :)
[13:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> Wow. Tom Preston-Werner left GitHub.
[13:32:16] <DaveMethvin> i'm waiting for a theme that has mp3 sounds and mp4 backgrounds
[13:32:21] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[13:34:47] <DaveMethvin> ut oh scott_gonzalez, didn't seem to like the npm publish http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/e8f69b.png
[13:35:30] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[13:35:56] <DaveMethvin> it could be a config thing since i just set up the vm
[13:36:07] <DaveMethvin> but it checked creds before starting right?
[13:36:31] <DaveMethvin> but that would seem like a long shot
[13:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> It says it was an error parsing json.
[13:36:52] <DaveMethvin> you don't believe error messages do you?
[13:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> And there was a 502 error.
[13:37:10] <scott_gonzalez> They're also in the middle of maintainence.
[13:37:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah it finally failed and i think it was returning a 502 with html instead of the JSON the code wanted
[13:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> Well, at least npm is the last thing for pre-releases.
[13:39:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah so i should be able to manually issue the commands
[13:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:39:17] <DaveMethvin> whenever "maintenance is done"
[13:39:22] <DaveMethvin> which i didn't know was going on
[13:39:46] <DaveMethvin> i just need to get this crap done, it's a busy day
[13:43:50] <scott_gonzalez> The maintainence notice doesn't say that it should affect publishing.
[13:44:03] <scott_gonzalez> You should just try again now. If it doesn't work, say something in #npm.
[13:52:00] <DaveMethvin> how long does publishing usually take? Is it normal for it to hang for a minute or more?
[13:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[13:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> Should be pretty fast.
[13:52:35] <DaveMethvin> ok it finally came back, seemed to work
[13:53:44] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, wonder if i should risk 1.11.1 rc2 now
[13:54:00] <DaveMethvin> well screw it, i would just need to manually publish to npm
