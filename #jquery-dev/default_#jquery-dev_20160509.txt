[12:42:49] <DaveMethvin> i forgot about it, good thing it's on my calendar
[12:44:02] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: just asking as I'm not a special person in the team and only us 3 got in the thread :)

[12:44:20] <DaveMethvin> it's probably just a get-to-know-you thing, what's the limit on hangouts these days?
[12:44:30] <DaveMethvin> if it's not too many people it seems like the more the better
[12:44:55] <m_gol> I don't think there's a limit, at least not a low one
[12:45:05] <DaveMethvin> i thought it was 10 for video calls
[12:45:07] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core build #1602: UNSTABLE in 13 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/1602/
[12:45:07] <doesallmagic2> Dave Methvin: Event: Add touch event properties, eliminates need for a plugin
[12:45:08] <DaveMethvin> at least it used to be
[12:45:27] <m_gol> k, I haven't tried more than 8-9 I think so I don't know
[12:45:50] <leobalter> DaveMethvin: I believe I've already got more than 15ppl in a hangouts call. 
[12:45:53] <m_gol> one limit is that each video stream consumes additional CPU power, my CPU is heating when I'm talking to 5 other streams :-)
[12:46:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah hangouts is the WORST for that
[12:46:16] <DaveMethvin> i did a video hangout on my phone once, got so hot it rebooted
[12:46:21] <m_gol> hahaha
[12:46:39] <DaveMethvin> so yeah you're on the invite list so if you can make it go for it
[12:46:44] <leobalter> it's an "etiquette" to mute audio and video when you're not talking.
[12:46:49] <m_gol> I had 200-300% CPU usage on the latest 15" MacBook Pro, not exactly the slowest of machines
[12:47:02] <m_gol> k :)
[12:47:36] <m_gol> leobalter: interesting; I've always muted audio but I've been in a lot of Hangouts talks and no one was muting video
[12:47:51] <leobalter> the alternative I use is appear.in, but I have no idea on limits
[12:47:51] <m_gol> it's not a quick switch to unmute the video, contrary to unmuting audio
[12:49:13] <leobalter> m_gol: we use hangouts at Bocoup, and for our cases, the video unmuting is not a problem. Anyway, we don't disable videos for smaller calls, up until 5 ppl
[12:49:15] <DaveMethvin> mozilla did the invite via hangouts so i guess we'll at least try to start with that
[12:50:48] <leobalter> has anything happened with the CLA checker? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/996 it didn't work here.
[12:51:47] <leobalter> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[12:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> I think jdalton had changes made.
[12:53:56] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't been working on the CLA checker.
