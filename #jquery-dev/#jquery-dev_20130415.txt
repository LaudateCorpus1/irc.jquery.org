[08:13:51] <rwaldron> ?tell JamesMGreene this is rad https://github.com/JamesMGreene/qunit-assert-html
[08:13:51] <b-ot> rwaldron: I‚Äôll tell JamesMGreene about that.
[08:13:52] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
[09:40:59] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron are you at txjs too?
[09:41:52] <m_gol> ok, so let's see if I got this right:
[09:41:52] <m_gol> 1) I pull upstream master to mine (done)
[09:41:52] <m_gol> 2) I rebase 13759-undefined to master (done)
[09:41:52] <m_gol> 3) I merge 13759-undefined to master and push it to upstream? is that OK?
[09:42:15] <DaveMethvin> yep looks good to me ... a couple of extras
[09:42:33] <DaveMethvin> 1) be sure to mention the ticket #13759 in the short summary
[09:43:00] <m_gol> it's in the description at the end
[09:43:10] <m_gol> Fixes #13759
[09:43:23] <DaveMethvin> 2) Mention "Close gh-1339" and it will close the pr
[09:43:35] <m_gol> ok
[09:43:42] <DaveMethvin> i usually do that touch up in an --amend after the merge
[09:44:14] <m_gol> btw, if you did that to my commits how did you preserve my author field?
[09:44:34] <DaveMethvin> the merge  preserves it
[09:44:42] <DaveMethvin> unless you --squash
[09:45:12] <DaveMethvin> but you can explictly specify --author="Their Name <their@mail>"
[09:45:20] <m_gol> ok
[09:45:36] <m_gol> I can check if everything's all right just before push, thankfully it's not svn :D
[09:45:42] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:46:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah there are a bunch of things that a committer does that the normal contributor doesn't ever have to do
[09:46:45] <m_gol> :)
[09:46:58] <DaveMethvin> git rebase -i   is awesome for squashing pull requests that have lots of spurious "fixed typo" commits
[09:47:42] <m_gol> yeah, I use it frequently :)
[09:47:53] <m_gol> ah, wrong repo URL, it has to be git@, not git://

[09:49:33] <DaveMethvin> Yeah!
[09:49:41] <m_gol> feels good! :D
[09:50:12] <DaveMethvin> looks great
[09:51:09] <m_gol> I can't wait until --screw-ie8 gets to the stable uglifyjs version
[09:51:32] <DaveMethvin> gotta love the name
[09:52:07] * m_gol I reported them the error I had in a nice construct:
[09:52:07] <m_gol> var fun;
[09:52:30] <m_gol> var fun;
[09:52:30] <m_gol> (function () {
[09:52:30] <m_gol>     fun = function fun() {...}
[09:52:30] <m_gol> })();
[09:52:59] <DaveMethvin> next uglify update we do, we'll need to change the way we do the sourcemap as well, mishoo fixed a bug in that where it was adding the path always
[09:53:13] <m_gol> it turned out it was because some defensive code against oldIE named function epressions screw ups
[09:53:31] <DaveMethvin> right, they always go into global scope,right?
[09:53:44] <m_gol> yup
[09:53:55] <m_gol> up until IE8
[09:54:13] <DaveMethvin> gotta run, be back in about an hour
[09:54:19] <m_gol> I asked mishoo to change the name from --screw-ie to --screw-ie8 so that we're sure IE9 is safe in the future
[09:54:27] <m_gol> ok, CU! thx for help with my first push :)

[12:00:06] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if you want to land https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1205#issuecomment-16394860 now, do it - let him PR for the unit tweak
[12:00:07] <b-ot> gnarf: Pull request #1205 by ros3cin (4w 1d ago): Fix for the ticket #13483
[12:00:11] <gnarf> the unit tests included are okay
[12:00:12] <gnarf> so 
[12:00:43] <gnarf> i was just asking for a little more generic, and make sure it tests all of the possibles, but the tests he already has gives me confidence in the patch
[18:10:00] <Krinkle> Guys, stuff is failing
[18:10:06] <Krinkle> Sizzle has failing tests
[18:10:08] <Krinkle> weird ones
[18:10:19] <Krinkle> Also, I get a weird blank error on this one: http://swarm.jquery.org/build/jquery/a19c831b382b737f8eb3de3955cc9d0fdf957660/test/index.html?module=Sizzle#
[18:10:23] <Krinkle> Can anyone reproduce that?
[18:10:37] <Krinkle> I see qunit for a second and then the page is wiped clean, <body> gone
[18:10:44] <Krinkle> seems to originate from ajax
[18:11:08] <Krinkle> not just sizzle
[18:11:09] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery
[19:03:21] <dcherman> Krinkle: was curious so i looked - i think it's this assertion blanking out the page - https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/test/unit/selector.js#L551
[19:36:05] <DaveMethvin> that looks like the code timmywil just added ^
