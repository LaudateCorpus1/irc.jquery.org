[08:35:05] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle|detached leobalter gibson042 scott_gonzalez arthurvr et al: QUnit meeting?
[08:36:10] <gibson042> I'm down
[08:36:34] <gibson042> but will have to leave a little early
[08:37:55] <arthurvr> Iâ€™m here :)
[08:38:38] <JamesMGreene> Hmm
[08:38:45] <JamesMGreene> ping jzaefferer Krinkle|detached leobalter 
[08:38:52] <leobalter> pong
[08:38:57] <JamesMGreene> o/
[08:38:58] <leobalter> I'm sorry for the delay
[08:39:12] <JamesMGreene> no worries, as you can see we haven't officially started yet
[08:39:51] <leobalter> jzaefferer told he's in a very busy week
[08:40:03] <JamesMGreene> oh, OK
[08:40:13] <JamesMGreene> We can just proceed in here, then
[08:40:14] <leobalter> We've got a lot of PRs from the GSoC
[08:40:30] <JamesMGreene> Yeah :+1:
[08:41:25] <JamesMGreene> So fill me in, if you can
[08:41:38] <leobalter> browserstack timeout are being a PITA
[08:41:38] <JamesMGreene> Is right now like the "student application" period?
[08:41:42] <leobalter> on travis CI
[08:42:05] <JamesMGreene> Assuming so since it's not nearly summer yet
[08:42:06] <leobalter> yes, it's still student application and they are already doing a lot of PRs :)
[08:42:15] <JamesMGreene> That's awesome :)
[08:43:11] <leobalter> scott_gonzalez found some existing bugs at #791
[08:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[08:44:11] <leobalter> on the autostart test, and we are in a way to make QUnit more friendly on AMD and Node enviroments. For node there's a proposal at #790 (more reviews appreciated)
[08:44:42] <leobalter> there's also a lot of good changes to come on the QUnit's diff
[08:46:18] <leobalter> JamesMGreene, I'm looking forward to see #670 done!
[08:47:24] <leobalter> and I'm waiting some changes like #784 and #785 to land so I can make a new patch to update the code style
[08:48:50] <leobalter> from today I'll need to stop writing more PRs to focus on reviewing the current PRs there
[08:49:02] <leobalter> there's a lot and I don't like to see them ageing
[08:49:18] <leobalter> that's my summary 
[08:52:15] <JamesMGreene> I should get about 2 hours tonight to work on jQuery stuff
[08:52:35] <JamesMGreene> But I'll probably start by catching up on js-reporters as that's been stagnant too long
[08:52:45] <JamesMGreene> and then come back to my QUnit PRs
[08:53:17] <JamesMGreene> #670 still seems to have much debate :-|
[09:07:39] <JamesMGreene> </QUnit meeting>
[09:08:48] <arthurvr> We should really try to get jquery-meeting next time guys
[09:09:45] <JamesMGreene> Agreed... but the muting and lack/availability of ops makes things difficult :-\
[09:11:19] <arthurvr> Who has the keys to give some more people access?
[09:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: I'd give you op, but I don't think I do it properly for it to stick around.
[09:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf s5fs arschmitz: Can one of you give JamesMGreene op in #jquery-meeting.
[09:13:04] <JamesMGreene> cool, thanks
[09:13:17] <arschmitz> i cant remember the "right" way
[09:13:23] <arschmitz> ill leave that to gnarf
[09:17:36] <JamesMGreene> Pretty sure that would be:  /msg chanserv flags #jquery-meeting JamesMGreene +o
[09:17:50] <JamesMGreene> and than I would have to request ops from ChanServ when I want them
[09:17:52] <JamesMGreene> then*
[09:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> Bah, it says I'm not authorized for that.
[09:22:29] <JamesMGreene> You could try /msg chanserv op #jquery-meeting JamesMGreene
[09:23:01] <JamesMGreene> same thing but I'm not sure if ChanServ is smart enough to see that a flags command is only for op granting (i.e. if they have different permission requirements)
[09:23:20] <JamesMGreene> Guessing it will end the same, though....
[09:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> That I can do.
[09:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> That's the command that doesn't stick.
[09:24:38] <JamesMGreene> Hmm, thought that was just `/op JamesMGreene`
[09:24:43] <JamesMGreene> but maybe that's just shorthand for the other
[09:25:36] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, looks like you were right
[09:25:42] <arschmitz> JamesMGreene: scott_gonzalez: oh right we cant do it properly you need flags permission
[09:25:44] <JamesMGreene> blargh
[09:25:50] <arschmitz> and i think just gnarf and ajpiano have that
[09:25:56] <JamesMGreene> oh well
[09:26:00] <JamesMGreene> I can wait, thanks for trying
[09:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil gibson042: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1516
[09:32:01] <synobium> hi
[09:32:16] <timmywil> Looks good, but keep in mind it may be backed out depending on beta feedback
[09:34:00] <synobium> i have experience of working in android studios, jqury, javascript, sqlite , can i waor in some project..? or do i need to learn something more ...?
[09:35:22] <synobium> take part*
[09:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Well, it's making our tests fail today.
[09:38:02] <scott_gonzalez> But notice that it's not just tests that needed to be updated.
[09:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> We had actual code break.
[09:39:35] <timmywil> ok, bring it up in the next meeting. That may be enough of a reason to back it out.
[09:39:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:42:21] <synobium> anyone
[09:51:03] <ryanneufeld>  /o\ Woot! https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=162757#c146
[09:53:47] <arthurvr> ryanneufeld: I just saw it 5 minutes ago. Awesome isnâ€™t it
[09:54:43] <ryanneufeld> it is very awesome
[09:56:16] <robertmaxrees> wow.  finally.
[09:57:01] <scott_gonzalez> Well, they still have required changes to the spec before they'll implement.
[09:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> But it's progress.
[09:57:23] <arthurvr> Yup
[09:57:26] <robertmaxrees> they're finally participating in some meaningful way.
[09:57:59] <scott_gonzalez> They've been participating in a meaningful way since day one.
[10:06:56] <ryanneufeld> Either way, this is a pretty important announcment
[10:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> indeed

[11:50:31] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: Thanks for digging into that UI PR.
[11:50:47] <gibson042> np; thanks for the heads-up
[11:52:02] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: What's this about? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1516/files#r27153236
[11:52:47] <gibson042> just noting different behavior when `this.options.title` is an empty string
[11:53:01] <gibson042> the old code would replace it with originalTitle; the new code doesn't
[11:53:15] <gibson042> which I think fixes an unreported bug
[11:53:37] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[11:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> The reason I had to change this is because `.text( undefined )` and `.text( null )` were different.
[11:54:43] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol 04deleted 06npo-update at 140065e1f: 02http://git.io/jtPk
[11:54:47] <scott_gonzalez>  `.text( null )` actually sets the text to "null"
[11:57:56] <gibson042> indeed
[11:58:22] <gibson042> and `.text( undefined )` may also set text to "undefined" in a future release
[11:58:24] <gibson042> FYI
[12:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> The old code was clearly buggy anyway.
[12:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> It didn't do the setting in an if/else.
[12:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> It did the if and then just unconditionally did another set.
[12:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure how the code got like that.
[12:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'd blame, but I'm 99% sure it will just say it was me :-P
