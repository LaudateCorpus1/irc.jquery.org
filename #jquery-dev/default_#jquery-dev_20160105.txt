[17:19:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ping
[17:19:30] <DaveMethvin> sup timeless 
[17:19:33] <DaveMethvin> timmywil
[17:19:35] <DaveMethvin> suh
[17:19:40] <timmywil> hey
[17:19:50] * timeless is just idling
[17:19:53] <DaveMethvin> lol
[17:20:05] <timmywil> there's a test I'm trying to fix in ie7
[17:20:15] <timmywil> looks like it was added for 1.11
[17:20:17] <timeless> ok, i'm going to assume i should go back to idling :)
[17:20:19] <timmywil> by YOU
[17:20:23] <DaveMethvin> ut oh
[17:20:24] <timeless> not me! :)
[17:20:36] <DaveMethvin> pointer?
[17:21:10] <timmywil> https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/blob/3e1cc501e0aeb643a597183c22f4ccbb3e07e9bd/test/unit/ajax.js#L45
[17:21:17] <timmywil> looks like it's dangling
[17:22:01] <timmywil> it says it passes, but the tests afterward hang
[17:22:25] <timmywil> how does it work?
[17:22:57] <DaveMethvin> let me take a look and see if i can remember
[17:23:39] <timmywil> doing a massive revert. I probably changed something that shouldn't be changed.
[17:24:07] <timmywil> the revert is the commit that dropped old browser support. Getting close, tho.
[17:25:56] <DaveMethvin> okay, i don't recall that at all but it looks like jaubourg wrote the test originally and I moved it over
[17:26:47] <DaveMethvin> i think that failure mode may actually be the way it reports tho
[17:29:33] <DaveMethvin> so that test should fail (and it seems to be) if there is no patch to close pending requests after a page unloads
[17:29:55] <timmywil> was it the removal of the unload handler?
[17:30:04] <DaveMethvin> that would do it
[17:30:17] <DaveMethvin> you;d still need that code in ie7
[17:30:19] <timmywil> ah, ok, I'll try addin git back
[17:30:25] <timmywil> adding it
[17:30:29] <DaveMethvin> godspeed
[17:30:34] <timmywil> :P
[17:30:44] <timmywil> after that is 3 json-related failures
[17:30:51] <timmywil> I'm hoping I'm nearing the end
