[06:38:55] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/build-system-future#14737000003081041
[06:39:52] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: yep, it's on our list for soon. rwaldron is looking into using grunt, which is ben_alman's build system
[06:40:12] <scott_gonzalez> Can you reply on the forum?
[06:40:25] <DaveMethvin> yep, will do
[06:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we should ditch our make branch if core's switching to grunt.
[06:41:21] <jzaefferer> I've kind of tried grunt the other day for my validation plugin
[06:42:08] <jzaefferer> its at least rough around the edges, but the general idea seems to be quite sane - abstract away all the gnarly details into a tool, leave only project specific configuration in each project
[06:42:41] <jzaefferer> for jQuery UI we'd probably need a few custom tasks
[06:42:58] <jzaefferer> but building them should be easier with the grunt API, e.g. using the uglify directive
[07:41:24] <mikesherov> .
[08:24:55] <Vespakoen> Hey there! I think i found a bug in the connectWith sortable stuff (jQuery UI) can you guys take a peek?
[08:25:07] <Vespakoen> http://jsfiddle.net/F3nck/19/
[08:25:27] <nFFF> Can we get closest() method renamed? :>>
[08:25:56] <nFFF> to parentClosest() :|
[08:26:03] <nFFF> bit ambigious as it is
[08:26:13] <ajpiano> Vespakoen: the stock answer on any interaction bug is that all the interactions are being rewritten and we are aware of bugs that exist in the implementation but aren't actively fixing bugs unless it's a dead-simple fix that can be shown not to break anything
[08:26:16] <ajpiano> nFFF: no
[08:26:54] <nFFF> ajpiano why?
[08:26:59] <nFFF> Dont you agree?
[08:27:25] <Vespakoen> breaks the api =P
[08:27:40] <ajpiano> nFFF: because we're not gonna rename methods that have been in core for several years just because it's ever so slightly vague
[08:27:49] <ajpiano> i hear ya that it's a touch ambiguous
[08:28:07] <Vespakoen> ajpiano, ok thats clear, although i am still a bit unsure if it is a bug or if i am just missing something / doing the impossible =P
[08:28:13] <ajpiano> but we're not gonna start having internal duplicative names for methods, and we're not gonna rename methods because of backcompat
[08:28:27] <nFFF> I understand, I just think a lot of people new to jQuery will think it will find the closest matched element, regardless of relationship
[08:28:37] <nFFF> ok fair points
[08:28:39] <nFFF> :>>
[08:28:43] <ajpiano> and then they can read the documentation, it doesn't hurt :)
[08:28:59] <nFFF> Perhaps it was just me :D
[08:29:35] <ajpiano> nFFF: if we renamed every method to avoid ambiguity to complete newcomers
[08:30:00] <nFFF> I didn't think about backwards compatibility
[08:30:07] <ajpiano> we'd also have .nextSiblingInTheDOM
[08:30:10] <ajpiano> etc.
[08:30:40] <nFFF> tru dat
[08:31:02] <kswedberg> nFFF: the other problem with parentClosest() is that it doesn't take into account that the "closest" could be the element itself, not necessarily a parent/ancestor
[08:31:02] <Vespakoen> oops, hit the close button
[08:32:18] <nFFF> kswedberg, I understand
[08:33:03] <nFFF> I wonder though if a method will ever be introduced to find the closest regardless of relationship and what it would be called :D
[08:33:25] <Vespakoen> nearest =P
[08:33:42] <Vespakoen> first()
[08:33:55] <ajpiano> nFFF: when we figure that out, it will just be overloaded into the method that most jquery users really want anything
[08:33:57] <nFFF> nearest works I think
[08:34:00] <ajpiano> $.fn.figureOutWhatImThinking
[08:36:26] <Vespakoen> need a pro, need a pro, need a pro, pro, pro http://jsfiddle.net/F3nck/19/
[08:37:03] <Vespakoen> fucking hell, i have been fiddling around all day =) =P
[08:37:03] <ajpiano> Vespakoen: unfortunately this is the wrong venue for that
[08:37:10] <Vespakoen> where should i go ?
[08:37:14] <ajpiano> Vespakoen: i know it's a tricky situation with complicated interactions stuff, i've been there myself
[08:37:17] <Vespakoen> jQuery chan doesnt help me either =(
[08:37:26] <ajpiano> turn inward :/
[08:37:34] <Vespakoen> lol
[08:37:40] <Vespakoen> ill put my head up my arse
[08:38:06] <ajpiano> Vespakoen: the problem with intensely custom sortable/droppable installs is that it really takes awhile for a third party to jump in and figure out and debug
[08:38:38] <Vespakoen> well i think its a basic question, mabye i should delete some crap thats irrelevant= P
[08:38:46] <ajpiano> always helps :)

[08:39:39] <Vespakoen> there you go, 19 lines =)

[16:31:39] <mikesherov> .
[16:32:24] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[16:32:36] <mikesherov> almighty core team lead
[16:33:07] <mikesherov> or anyone?
[16:33:08] <DaveMethvin> who DARES to summon the almighty core team lead? :)
[16:33:12] <mikesherov> HAHA
[16:33:27] <mikesherov> So, what's our policy on IE6 and IE7 bugs
[16:33:44] <mikesherov> I remember reading/hearing somewhere that we're not fixing those??
[16:33:56] <DaveMethvin> well it depends on the bug
[16:33:59] <mikesherov> I see
[16:34:10] <DaveMethvin> in general if it's an ie6/7 bug people should be used to them bynow
[16:34:16] <mikesherov> LOL
[16:34:18] <DaveMethvin> we're not trying any new heroics
[16:34:24] <mikesherov> ok, so I'm trying to really clean up the bug list for CSS/dimensions
[16:35:00] <mikesherov> and I keep looking at the same IE7/IE6 bugs every pass through
[16:35:03] <DaveMethvin> if you have a list, send em out to the bugs team and we can come to some conclusion
[16:35:14] <DaveMethvin> if they're minor i'd prefer to close them wontfix
[16:35:41] <DaveMethvin> ie6/7 can still be used with jquery even tho there are some probs here and there
[16:35:50] <mikesherov> right
[16:36:18] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6841 is the one I'm most concerned with closing
[16:36:41] <mikesherov> oh, actually, that's IE8 too
[16:36:41] <mikesherov> nvm
[16:36:47] <mikesherov> I'll send the list out as you suggested
[16:37:00] <DaveMethvin> sounds good, let's bury those suckers
[16:37:09] <mikesherov> yeah
[16:37:33] <mikesherov> also, I have one other question
[16:37:57] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/630
[16:37:58] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (2m, 1w ago): fixes #7986, Bug in $.support.boxModel if page has DIV-element CSS
[16:38:12] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, that was for 1.8?
[16:38:22] <mikesherov> this is the one I submitted a while ago that turns support.boxModel into really a check for CSS1Compat
[16:38:27] <mikesherov> it didn't need to be for 1.8
[16:38:31] <DaveMethvin> oh ok
[16:38:47] <DaveMethvin> well we can land that one in 1.7.2 then
[16:38:55] <mikesherov> it got closed when we had that big purge a few months back when there were like 25 pulls in the queue
[16:39:04] <mikesherov> and I said I can save it
[16:39:35] <mikesherov> Before it's merged... I tested it pretty thoroughly, but... it is a change for support.boxModel in theory
[16:39:49] <mikesherov> so it might have some effects on quirks mode
[16:39:58] <mikesherov> but it isn't really a bug
[16:40:12] <DaveMethvin> that reminds me i need to put together that message about deprecations, and really we don't fully support quirks anyway
[16:40:30] <mikesherov> Right, and our tests doesn't test quirks mode
[16:40:46] <mikesherov> I'd just love some guidance on whether or not it's really appropriate for 1.7.2, and I'd like I guess some more testing from someone else
[16:41:00] <mikesherov> but as far as I'm concerned, I think we can land it in 1.7.2
[16:41:08] <mikesherov> it'll be gone by 1.8 anyway :-)
[16:41:45] <DaveMethvin> i'll take a look
[16:41:49] <mikesherov> so I'm going to rebase it ONE LAST TIME
[16:41:57] <DaveMethvin> ok this will be the LAST ONE
[16:42:02] <mikesherov> and then I'll leave it in your capable hands if it's mergable or not
[16:43:00] <mikesherov> oh, by the way, congrats in person on your promotion to HIGH EXALTED RULER
[16:43:51] <mikesherov> pushed
[16:43:54] <mikesherov> rebased*
[16:44:28] <DaveMethvin> awww, shucks
[16:44:41] <DaveMethvin> ok, now the ball is in my court
[16:44:56] <DaveMethvin> imma go take a shower, just finished running
[16:44:57] <mikesherov> LOL
[16:45:05] <mikesherov> later
