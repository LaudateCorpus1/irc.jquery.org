[17:57:23] <gnarf> gibson042: you here?
[17:57:29] <gnarf> looking at that finish pull
[17:57:35] <gnarf> what causes this bug?
[17:58:00] <gibson042> gnarf: animating multiple elements, and then .finish()ing a subset of them
[17:58:04] <gnarf> sure
[17:58:11] <gnarf> but whats funky in the old code
[17:58:27] <gnarf> why do you need to look for one that already started?
[17:58:35] <gnarf> etc
[17:59:18] <gibson042> the old code had all animations share a function, and each overwrote the `.finish` property when they began
[17:59:34] <gnarf> oh
[17:59:45] <gnarf> doAnimation.finish
[17:59:49] <gibson042> yep
[18:04:10] <gnarf> hrm
[18:08:46] <gnarf> gibson042: do you remember if it was finish that added hooks.cur to queue?
[18:10:31] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/compare/jquery:1.x-master...finish-fix
[18:10:38] <gnarf> gibson042: we might be able to cut out hooks.cur
[18:11:51] <gibson042> ah, now we're talkin'
[18:13:04] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1118
[18:13:18] <gnarf> yeah
[18:13:21] <gnarf> added by finish
[18:15:24] <gibson042> I thought it went back farther, but there it is
[18:16:59] <gnarf> gibson042: https://github.com/gibson042/jquery/pull/1
[18:18:04] <gnarf> gibson042: only -27
[18:18:05] <gnarf> but
[18:18:11] <gnarf> ;)
[18:18:11] <gibson042> no, that's great
[18:18:18] <gibson042> and looks much better to boot
[18:18:28] <gibson042> thanks a ton
[18:18:47] <gnarf> i think that nets us -7 yeah?
[18:19:49] <gibson042> yes; I do believe so
[18:20:01] <gibson042> :D
[18:20:23] <gnarf> oooh
[18:20:30] <gnarf>    raw     gz Compared to last run                                             
[18:20:30] <gnarf>    -12     -4 dist/jquery.js                                                   
[18:20:30] <gnarf>    -17     -9 dist/jquery.min.js  
[18:20:33] <gnarf> -9 even
[18:22:07] <gnarf> you should pick up those two commits on your fork, update the pr and land it
[18:22:08] <gnarf> :)
[18:22:16] <gibson042> that's the plan :)
[18:22:29] <gibson042> thanks again
[18:24:08] <gnarf> sok
[18:24:14] <gnarf> got my sunday activity on github
[18:24:17] <gnarf> those are rare ;)
[18:31:35] <gnarf> eh
[18:31:37] <gnarf> failed us a unit
[18:31:47] <gibson042> yeah; https://github.com/gibson042/jquery/blob/9227ef0ecb3c147b50b07d2ad0d998928fbe22e7/test/unit/effects.js#L2096
[18:31:49] <gnarf> effects: .finish() calls finish of custom queue functions (1, 2, 3)
[18:32:07] <gibson042> a missing finish call in there somewhere
[18:32:11] <gnarf> nope
[18:32:18] <gnarf> so
[18:32:19] <gnarf> hey
[18:32:33] <gnarf> move that to queueTester( next, hooks ) { hooks.finish = 
[18:32:38] <gnarf> also
[18:33:01] <gnarf> should call the one in progress inside the hooks
[18:33:06] <gnarf> and 2 of the fn.finish()
[18:33:36] <gnarf> and let DaveMethvin|away take a look at it
[18:33:41] <gnarf> i don't think we ever documented these
[18:36:27] <gnarf> gibson042: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/commit/78878eab44fb19cf53c16594183f7a3692dd6f64
[18:36:34] <gnarf> cherry-pick if you like
[18:39:26] <gibson042> yeah, that's ringing bells
[18:40:21] <gnarf> pretty sure this was just undocumented :)
[18:42:51] <gnarf> though thinking about it it should probably call (hooks.finish || hooks.stop || $.noop)(); here: https://github.com/gibson042/jquery/pull/1/files#L0R578
[18:43:41] <gnarf> and yeah, only stop if finish doesn't exist
[18:44:04] <gnarf> i wonder 
[18:44:09] <gnarf> if stop.true() might be enough
[18:44:12] <gnarf> stop(true)
[18:45:31] <gibson042> will that actually be applicable?
[18:45:51] <gibson042> I don't remember the details of populating hooks
[18:49:33] <gnarf> so 
[18:49:44] <gnarf> the hook doesn't actually do anything once its the one running
[18:55:03] <gnarf> gibson042: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/commit/1626145
[18:55:53] <gnarf> now it's -13 total
[18:56:13] <gnarf> you should just reset --hard 1626145 on your branch :)
[18:56:17] <gnarf> get rid of that merge commit
[18:56:35] <gibson042> lol
[18:56:39] <gibson042> fair enough :)
[18:56:57] <gnarf> seems better this way
[18:56:58] <gnarf> yeah?
[18:58:45] <gibson042> very much so
[19:00:22] <gibson042> so queueable.finish was never documented, right?
[19:21:39] <gnarf> i dont think so
[20:28:20] <gnarf> gibson042: heh, solved a bug i didn't know we had
[20:29:01] <gibson042> now I *know* it's the right fix :)
