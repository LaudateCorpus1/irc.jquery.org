[05:19:00] <JamesMGreeneAway> gseguin|away Did you attend JSConf US 2012? I have this feeling that I've actually met you

[09:40:42] <JamesMGreene> gseguin: Do you work for Jive?
[09:41:02] <gseguin> JamesMGreene: I do
[09:41:10] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, I think we met in AZ
[09:41:23] <JamesMGreene> (Just briefly, like while eating a meal)
[09:41:45] <gseguin> heh, small world
[09:41:51] <JamesMGreene> indeed
[09:41:56] <gseguin> are you going this year?
[09:42:28] <JamesMGreene> 'fraid not
[09:42:36] <JamesMGreene> but I'll be in Portland for jQCon
[09:42:58] <gseguin> kewl! It'll be a pleasure to meet you again ;)
[09:43:33] <gseguin> I'll be in Portland as well
[09:44:02] <JamesMGreene> CityPages.com is ironic... as soon as I go to it, it prompts me to join mailing lists, and yet it also wants me to succeed at a CAPTCHA, wtf
[09:44:54] <JamesMGreene> I applied to be a trainer at JSConf this year
[09:45:02] <JamesMGreene> Pretty surprised I got turned down, honestly, but oh well
[09:46:00] <gseguin> that's a bummer! sorry to hear
[09:46:24] <JamesMGreene> Yeah... I don't find their training offerings all that thrilling either o_O
[09:46:32] <JamesMGreene> I figured I would be beat out by awesome stuff
[09:48:02] <JamesMGreene> Justin Meyer's sound fun but the rest are just "meh" to me

[09:50:15] <gseguin> JamesMGreene: I would have attended ;)
[09:50:30] <gseguin> but Appium looks interesting
[09:50:36] <JamesMGreene> Thanks, I think lots of people would've
[09:51:20] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, Appium is somewhat interesting but I personally don't have a lot of interest in iOS
[09:51:52] <gseguin> I don't have an interest in it either but my users do

[11:08:47] * JamesMGreene is frantically working to choose a date for a Nodecopter Summer of Drones event
[12:38:30] <JamesMGreene> gseguin Is there a Jive App for Wiki?
[12:38:50] <JamesMGreene> I'm very shocked our company's Jive-based intranet site don't have Wikis....
[12:40:15] <gseguin> JamesMGreene: not that I know off
[12:40:43] <JamesMGreene> Very surprising
[12:40:57] <gseguin> JamesMGreene: wiki is a little technical. Our target audience is very much enterprise
[12:41:05] <JamesMGreene> Leads to us have fragmented Wiki usage on various other platforms
[12:41:12] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, I suppose that's true
[12:41:16] <gseguin> They mostly need RTE
[12:41:26] <JamesMGreene> Most of our company is "enterprise", minus the devs ;)
[12:41:52] <gseguin> JamesMGreene: though you can have a document that you edit either with the RTE or directly in HTML
[12:42:16] <gseguin> and it can be edited by multiple people
[12:42:48] <gseguin> JamesMGreene: who do you work for?
[12:42:55] <JamesMGreene> Thomson Reuters
[12:43:24] <gseguin> Oh I remember talking with you now
[12:43:45] <JamesMGreene> yeah :)
[14:51:28] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: Actually, the organisations link *is* in the interface
[14:51:47] <Krinkle> The top left GitHub logo
[14:51:53] <Krinkle> it links to the dashboard you last used
[14:52:12] <Krinkle> https://github.com/ -> Dashboards: [ Krinkle, jquery ] -> jquery -> https://github.com/organizations/jquery
[14:52:19] <Krinkle> From then on the logo links straight to https://github.com/organizations/jquery
[14:52:24] <Krinkle> on every page
[20:04:45] * JamesMGreene hopes his application to host a Nodecopter "Summer of Drones" event goes through
