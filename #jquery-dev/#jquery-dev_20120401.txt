[16:04:21] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg created 1.8/#11011/Callbacks (+1 new commit): http://git.io/8FPi5A
[16:04:21] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.8/#11011/Callbacks] Allows traditional options object for $.Callbacks flags. Fixes #11011. Unit tests added. - jaubourg
[16:30:20] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg created 1.8/#11010/Deferred (+1 new commit): http://git.io/epBqHg
[16:30:20] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.8/#11010/Deferred] Makes Deferred implementation truly Promise/A compliant. Unit tests amended. Actually few changes required in jQuery's own source and we gained 8 bytes minified gzipped \o/. - jaubourg
[16:54:46] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg created 1.8/#10944/ajax (+1 new commit): http://git.io/XYRMHg
[16:54:46] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.8/#10944/ajax] $.ajax now always returns an object implementing the Promise interface. Fixes #10944. Unit tests amended. - jaubourg
[17:05:15] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg pushed 1 new commit to 1.8/#10944/ajax: http://git.io/dNC95w
[17:05:15] <jqcommit> [jquery/1.8/#10944/ajax] For much improved consistency, jqXHR.abort() sets a default statusText of 'canceled' right until after beforeSend has been called (in which case it reverts to the default of 'abort'): now all early aborts have a statusText of 'canceled'. - jaubourg
