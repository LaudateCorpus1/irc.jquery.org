[16:50:09] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: it waits for non-responsive browsers that have timed out
[16:50:28] <m_gol> I restarted those 2 runs, they should get the new browsers spawned

[16:50:36] <DaveMethvin> :)
[16:50:37] <m_gol> yup, almost immediately ;)
[16:50:45] <m_gol> it has started happening recently
[16:51:04] <m_gol> so many quirks to remember :)
[16:51:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[16:51:36] <DaveMethvin> ok i just need to land the change to the startup message and I think 1.4.0 is ready
[16:51:48] <m_gol> cool :)
[17:03:48] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: FYI: I had to kill testswarm-browserstack to update it to the new API, it will resume itself in a minute
[17:03:56] <m_gol> in the meantime, no browsers spawned
[17:04:10] <DaveMethvin> ok
[17:04:12] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[17:04:40] <m_gol> we should finally access the API via a secure protocol now (oops)
