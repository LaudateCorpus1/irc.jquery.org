[01:04:35] <jl2753> hi, i'm stuck and hoping someone could give some advice or direction on how to proceed.
[01:04:39] <jl2753> http://jsfiddle.net/nncK6/3/
[01:04:56] <jl2753> whenever I enter 5 characters in input1, it hides the active (this is correct)
[01:05:15] <jl2753> but whenever I enter more than 5 characters, the active text then flashes
[01:05:34] <jl2753> I'm new to jquery and assuming that this has something to do with the keypress still being recognized?
[07:38:26] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, do we have a meeting today?
[07:52:56] <DaveMethvin> m_gol yes!
[07:52:56] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[07:52:59] <DaveMethvin> `read
[07:53:01] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: From m_gol, 19h 15m ago: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap/HsImWQq9J8g/jaRrwfp85OwJ
[07:53:38] <DaveMethvin> > Dart omits this field and Chrome just emits a warning.
[07:53:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah and NOBODY will complain about Chrome spewing a warning with the word jquery in it ... 
[07:54:22] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: you know that chrome throws an error mentioning jquery?
[07:54:33] * ryanneufeld ducks
[07:54:46] <DaveMethvin> why I aughta ... 
[07:54:55] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ahh, I ommited that one
[07:55:14] <m_gol> but if they remove the requirement for that from the spec, Chrome should remove the warning
[07:55:26] <m_gol> and we could use the absolute path
[07:56:01] <DaveMethvin> we'll have to give that one a try and see what it barfs
[07:56:05] <m_gol> I re-posted this another proposal excluding path from the file here: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap/HsImWQq9J8g/jaRrwfp85OwJ
[07:56:34] <m_gol> using the absolute path is still not ideal, CDNs would probably prefer to have their own map location
[07:56:35] <jaubourg> plop
[07:56:45] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg
[07:56:51] <jaubourg> hey Dave
[07:56:54] <jaubourg> sup?
[07:57:13] <DaveMethvin> just recovering from my moscow trip
[07:57:25] <DaveMethvin> i dunno how markelog can live 8 hours in the future like that :)
[07:57:45] <jaubourg> that bad? did you fly east or west to go there? west I suppose?
[07:57:45] <DaveMethvin> it was awesome tho
[07:58:01] <m_gol> :)
[07:58:07] <DaveMethvin> i flew over sweden
[07:58:16] <jaubourg> I can imagine, wish I had the time but I'm due in Norway next week, then there's amsterdam, then there's thailand, too many travels
[07:58:24] <DaveMethvin> wow
[07:58:38] <DaveMethvin> i'll be in paris with my wife early december for that dotJS conf
[07:58:44] <jaubourg> niiiice
[07:59:03] <jaubourg> let me know exactly when and I'll come and see you guys
[07:59:07] <DaveMethvin> ok
[08:25:57] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I won't be able to attend more than 20/25 minutes of the meeting today
[08:26:27] <DaveMethvin> ok, i hope it won't take the whole hour
[08:41:24] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Migrate Core 1.x build #121: STILL FAILING in 3 min 1 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Migrate%20Core%201.x/121/
[09:00:27] <DaveMethvin> okay, i'll start the meeting in just a minute
[10:09:00] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap/rIt4kvlC6GI/0xtaB7TLqMwJ
[10:09:15] <m_gol> I'll be happy if this one little change went through
[10:09:24] <m_gol> * I'd
[10:10:48] <DaveMethvin> m_gol where would sourceRoot be set? In the map file?
[10:11:04] <m_gol> yes
[10:11:07] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[10:11:24] <DaveMethvin> here is what i am thinking
[10:12:13] <DaveMethvin> there are two common scenarios
[10:12:30] <DaveMethvin> 1) people use the files from the cdn; the map should "just work" for that situation
[10:12:40] <DaveMethvin> 2) people copy the min file but nothing else
[10:12:51] <DaveMethvin> 3) people copy all the files
[10:13:04] <DaveMethvin> i think #2 gets fixed here too
[10:13:20] <DaveMethvin> but if they copy all 3 the map will still come from the cdn where they got the file
[10:13:36] <m_gol> so, if there's no reference to the map file in the minified once, all of them by default would generate no map support at all
[10:13:40] <m_gol> even if one copied all 3 files
[10:13:53] <m_gol> it would require people to add this one reference manually in the script tag
[10:13:59] <m_gol> but I don't think that's a bad thing
[10:14:08] <DaveMethvin> with the current spec, there's only 1 way to get map support
[10:14:12] <DaveMethvin> via the comment
[10:14:22] <m_gol> most people don't care about source maps, they just see the errors and freak out
[10:14:23] <m_gol> yes
[10:14:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:14:43] <m_gol> so what I wrote should fix these most common problems
[10:14:55] <DaveMethvin> but it would be just as easy to have some external method of associating maps within the dev tools
[10:15:12] <m_gol> sure, that would be awesome as well
[10:15:27] <m_gol> those 2 can co-exist
[10:15:35] <m_gol> I just want the path out of the minified file
[10:15:39] <DaveMethvin> that avoids any need to spec out a new property of the script tag, which i can see taking years
[10:15:43] <m_gol> since we see how that works out
[10:15:47] <m_gol> hmm
[10:15:54] <m_gol> I see your point
[10:16:15] <m_gol> well, there's always the manifest approach as well
[10:16:15] <DaveMethvin> i mean it may  happen eventually but really this is only used by dev tools so it can be out of band
[10:16:21] <m_gol> doesn't require new script attributes
[10:16:56] <DaveMethvin> for the beta i'm inclined to leave it out and start a discussion to see whether there are really a lot of people using it now
[10:17:03] <DaveMethvin> not sure there are
[10:17:11] <m_gol> ah, I see
[10:17:33] <m_gol> you want to see if there's any feedback like "WHERE ARE MY SOURCEMAPS, YOU STUPID JQUERY"
[10:17:35] <m_gol> ;)
[10:17:41] <DaveMethvin> lol yeah
[10:17:59] <DaveMethvin> the funny thing is, they can just tack on //# sourceMappingURL=http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js 
[10:18:03] <DaveMethvin> to the end of the file
[10:18:12] <m_gol> hmm
[10:18:16] <m_gol> that's a nice idea
[10:18:24] <m_gol> we could generate all 3 files but just strip out the comment
[10:18:32] <DaveMethvin> but of course they will complain that they can't get THAT file from the CDN
[10:18:37] <DaveMethvin> only the one without the comment
[10:19:15] <DaveMethvin> jquery-2.0.3-with-map.min.js
[10:19:21] <DaveMethvin> :)
[10:19:31] <DaveMethvin> which nobody would ever use
[10:19:36] <m_gol> ideally CDNs would produce the files with the comment but the comment would be stripped out on any copying the file by users :P (I know, I know)
[10:19:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah!
[10:19:55] <m_gol> hmm
[10:20:06] <m_gol> I started thinking this -with-map might be a good idea :P
[10:20:27] <m_gol> we could put it far on the bottom of the download page with a disclaimer
[10:20:44] <DaveMethvin> it seems one of the scenarios the map creators thought would be common was people wanting to debug production sites that were using minified js
[10:20:56] <m_gol> yes
[10:20:59] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: sorry I missed the meeting. I had a lunch meeting. Reading the notes now
[10:21:06] <DaveMethvin> np timmywil
[10:21:21] <DaveMethvin> i have to run out and do an errand, i'll be back in about 45 minutes
[10:21:26] <m_gol> there are some cases where it'd be almost impossible to debug without source maps
[10:21:37] <m_gol> it's when you write in languages not recognized by the browser, like Sass
[10:21:50] <m_gol> with JS for most of the time you can just use unminified files for debugging
[10:22:02] <DeeJRoth> Hello group. I am having an issue building jquery via the directions on github, is this the correct place to ask? (there is a trail here...#jquery sent me to #Node.js, they sent me here.)
[10:22:59] <m_gol> DeeJRoth: let's head to #jquery, I'll help you there
[10:23:10] <DeeJRoth> Awesome, thank you
[10:51:01] <miketaylr> back
[13:08:44] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Karma (previously known as Testacular) has made some recent improvents. Looks like they've cut out the middle layer of WebDriver/Selenium. Quite nice. It's quite close to the model that I was after for TestSwarm Next (connect browsers to the nodejs server swarm, distribute tests through an child page iframe or next page, then report back and report to nodejs console output) 
[13:08:58] <Krinkle> And even includes an experimental browserstack/saucelabs integration now.
[13:09:18] <Krinkle> I'll be checking that out this week before I potentially pick up the grunt-saucelabs pieces again.
[13:14:20] <Krinkle> And passing unique IDs in the urls to the clients so that you can tie the new client connecting to the spawn command.
[13:14:33] <Krinkle> and a nice plugin interface
[13:14:35] <Krinkle> Like like like!
[13:29:05] <Krinkle> Found 1 good example of a project using it (https://travis-ci.org/yhwh/stimuli), was hard to find though, so looks like documentation is lacking
[13:36:44] <snover> curiously how is it ‚Äúnice‚Äù to cut out the standards-track API part that enables testing things that cannot be tested from within the browser sandbox?
[14:01:02] <Krinkle> snover: I'm referring to the context of unit tests, not UI or integration tests.
[14:01:20] <Krinkle> For UI and intergration tests, wd/selenium seems like the best way to go.
[14:04:18] <Krinkle> snover: also, perceptual image diff is nice. Slowly getting more tracking, and quite useful in development of UI rich applications. I'm currently looking into using that for one of Wikipedia's new UI features (VisualEditor, the new page editor). We've had a few cases now where something caused a regression that could've visually been spotted by a machine, but hard to catch by the human eye, unit tests or 
[14:04:18] <Krinkle> integration tests.
[14:04:48] <Krinkle> of course a diff doesnt' always mean a failure, it's just information to look at and useful to have while looking at the per-merge build.
