[07:32:34] <DaveMethvin> just playing swarmy here on my local machine, and then running the release scripts
[08:14:41] <JamesMGreene> A question I never expected to be asking: Does anyone know any current or former Flash/Flex/ActionScript dev experts?
[09:31:23] <snover> JamesMGreene: i am one of those
[09:31:24] <b-ot> snover: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.

[09:32:04] <snover> scott_gonzalez: aside from the overuse of abbrs, the internals of trac are not awful enough that i want to write a new bug tracker

[10:25:18] <snover> say, can someone point me in the direction of the documentation for committers about how to commit to the repo?
[10:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> git commit :-P
[10:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Does this cover what you want? http://contribute.jquery.org/code/
[10:26:45] <snover> Iâ€™m interested in guidelines for squashing commits etc.
[10:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[10:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure if core has a document about it.
[10:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> UI has a short section about it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui#for-committers
[10:29:22] <scott_gonzalez> We have some more extensive notes about PRs/merging/squashing: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40154555/Pull%20Requests
[10:29:46] <scott_gonzalez> Which we're in the process of porting to the contribute site: https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/41
[10:30:18] <snover> sweet.
[10:30:19] <snover> thanks!
[10:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[10:40:57] <snover> TIL cherry-pick -x flag
[10:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, it's really nice.
[10:44:14] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Check this out: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/33cf8d4b350f11fa954f
[10:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> Commits in master that weren't cherry-picked to 1-8-stable :-)
[10:58:11] <snover> i wonder how long it will take for that to become an unwieldy list :)
[10:59:48] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, well that list was >1,000
[11:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> I wasn't using it to find commits that should be cherry-picked.
[11:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> I was using it as a base list for the 1.9 changelog.
[11:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> The goal was just to weed out the hundreds of commits that had already been cherry-picked and were in a 1.8.x changelog.
[11:01:36] <snover> itâ€™s a good thing.
