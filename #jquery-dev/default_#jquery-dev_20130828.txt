[01:59:22] <m_gol> paul_irish: tests requiring layout will be executed only when needed (and with cached results, obviously)
[05:10:18] <scott_gonzalez> New comment on one of my articles: "I had 3 jQuery version running on same page and was not able to resolve the problem. Your article helped me in solving it."
[05:10:32] <m_gol> hahaha
[05:10:50] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe I should write another article: How to stop using multiple versions of jQuery.
[05:11:11] <m_gol> one of official US VISA sites has a pattern: repeat a few times: {one jQuery, one script tag with code in doc ready}
[05:11:24] <m_gol> one of these jQuerys were 1.4.x, another 1.2.x
[05:11:42] <m_gol> it was one just under the other in HTML
[05:21:03] <scott_gonzalez> oh boy
[06:00:13] <scott_gonzalez> New requirement for using jQuery: The page must be UTF-8. :-)

[11:15:50] <rogeruiz> question about event testing with qunit. is there a reliable way to test complex events like orientationchange or resize with qunit? or would it just be easier to abstract that code out and pass a context to my testable js?
[11:16:56] <DaveMethvin> rogeruiz you might try asking in #jquery
[11:24:24] <snover> rogeruiz: try using a testing framework designed to dispatch real events like those, like intern
[11:30:58] <rogeruiz> snover: DaveMethvin: thanks. I'll check that out
[11:33:26] <rogeruiz> snover: intern.js sounds promising. thanks again
