[05:35:07] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin mikesherov: Do we support this? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8940
[05:35:24] <scott_gonzalez> .seen Krinkle
[05:35:25] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, I saw Krinkle 2h 29m ago, changing nick to Krinkle|detached.
[05:35:31] <scott_gonzalez> .seen JohnResig
[05:35:32] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, I saw JohnResig 16h 41m ago, joining #jquery.
[05:35:40] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's not helpful.
[05:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? I can't resolve github.com o_O
[07:24:04] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: should each jquery project declare a dependency on grunt-cli?
[07:24:53] <DaveMethvin> it has to be installed globally, which the npm wont' do, right?
[07:24:56] <DaveMethvin> npm install
[07:26:07] <DaveMethvin> so it seems like the readme should just specify npm -g install grunt-cli ; npm install
[07:28:27] <DaveMethvin> on the #8940 question above, padding and margin on html/body always made me queasy; he's saying it works on all browsers but i have a vague recollection of problems there. maybe it was just the default stylesheets though
[08:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: No projects should declare a dependency on grunt-cli.
[08:01:54] <DaveMethvin> but it needs to be installed, right?
[08:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[08:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> But it should be installed at the system level.
[08:02:04] <DaveMethvin> so i need to update our readme, cool
[08:02:08] <scott_gonzalez> Not as a local module.
[08:02:12] <DaveMethvin> right

[08:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, you linked to my fork :-P
[08:07:00] <DaveMethvin> oh that's the one i had up, hm
[08:11:49] <DaveMethvin> dog walk
[08:44:51] <DaveMethvin> back
[08:51:43] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: So are you not sure whether jQuery supports that CSS?
[08:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, found this on the .position() docs:
[08:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> Note: jQuery does not support getting the position coordinates of hidden elements or accounting for borders, margins, or padding set on the body element.
[08:52:51] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: right, i thought that was due to some irreconcilable cross-browser differences
[08:52:57] <DaveMethvin> but i don't know what they are
[08:53:14] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm going to close as wontfix and tell him to take it up with core :-)
[08:53:29] <DaveMethvin> sure .. i suspect if it was simple it would have been fixed long ago
