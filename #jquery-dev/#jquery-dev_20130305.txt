[06:56:40] <JamesMGreene> Holy crap is the Flex compiler ever complicated....
[06:57:18] <JamesMGreene> (off-topic, sorry, just working on a Grunt plugin for the Flex compiler and being amazed at the depth of its configuration)
[12:55:40] <paul_irish> Krinkle: have any updates on addEmbeddedCSS ?
[12:55:57] <Krinkle> rarrrr, got me.
[12:56:07] <Krinkle> Something else came up.
[12:56:18] <Krinkle> I'll do it right now actually.
[12:57:37] <paul_irish> Cool! I'll stick around
[13:03:08] <Krinkle> paul_irish: Meanwhile, do you have a local mediawiki install to play with?
[13:05:03] <paul_irish> i don't
[13:05:48] <Krinkle> paul_irish: I'll make screenshots of my timeline, but if you want to play with it, you may wanna do a git clone so you can check it out from our code-review (Gerrit) later to play with it yourself.
[13:06:02] <paul_irish> Krinkle: what OS are you on
[13:06:07] <Krinkle> I'm on Mac.
[13:06:21] <paul_irish> http://progrium.com/localtunnel/
[13:06:32] <Krinkle> git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/p/mediawiki/core.git (may wanna do depth/1 since it has a large history)
[13:06:42] <Krinkle> I'm familiar with it
[13:06:53] <paul_irish> that way i can try your instance
[13:07:39] <paul_irish> i can't set up MW today. super busy :
[13:07:40] <paul_irish> :/
[13:07:54] <Krinkle> I got quite a few vhosts locally, I'll have to add that to it. I'll use no-ip.org instead, since I have that set up already.
[13:08:54] <Krinkle> paul_irish: git clone, pauls.awesome.dev/tmp/mediawiki-core/config, steps, done. (slightly more complicated than WordPress, though MW supports sqlite)
[13:09:03] <Krinkle> paul_irish: will provide a url for you, no worries.
[13:12:03] <Krinkle> paul_irish: This is what I got currently (before any change) http://cl.ly/image/200n3E1c3F1e does that resemble the problem as you last saw it?
[13:13:30] <paul_irish> Krinkle: swtich to frames view. you'll se the big yellow spike.
[13:13:40] <paul_irish> then open the three yellow container bars
[13:13:47] <paul_irish> to see all the big recalc style blocks
[13:17:16] <paul_irish> Krinkle: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwyiLQAniQo
[13:21:31] <Krinkle> paul_irish: http://krinkle.no-ip.org/wiki/Main_Page
[13:21:40] <Krinkle> paul_irish: "This video is private."
[13:22:04] <paul_irish> Krinkle: fixed
[13:22:35] <Krinkle> thx
[13:22:38] <paul_irish> cool. the host works nice
[13:23:42] <paul_irish> i can repro the same on your host though it's about 15% of the pain that WP feels. 
[13:25:07] <Krinkle> yeah, I don't have any plugins installed on that host. But it all uses the same system.
[13:31:05] <Krinkle> paul_irish: I'm reconfiguring it now, I'll let you know when I have something.
[13:40:51] <paul_irish> sgtm
