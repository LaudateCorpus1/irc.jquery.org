[00:55:27] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] No more php/js logic duplication. Ensures modules are still loaded separately when using "file:" protocol (makes debugging much easier, /kiss @rwaldron).

[03:02:30] <jqcommit> [qunit/master] Add QUnit.pushFailure to log error conditions like exceptions.

[05:35:11] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I broke testwarm or so it seems (aren't you glad I'm back :P)
[05:35:34] <jaubourg> jzaefferer: thanks for the heads up :) and hi :)
[05:35:43] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: i noticed jenkins didn't yell at me last night
[05:36:03] <DaveMethvin> so i figured somebody put the cement shoes on him
[05:36:23] <DaveMethvin> couldn't happen to a nicer bot
[05:36:38] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: johnbender rm-rf-ed it
[05:36:52] <DaveMethvin> whoops
[05:36:57] <jzaefferer> at least the jquery job
[05:37:17] <jzaefferer> `rm -rf jQuery Mobile Latest` <- not what he intended :-)
[05:37:25] <DaveMethvin> lol!
[05:38:29] <jaubourg> woops
[05:39:14] <jaubourg> I dunno, maybe there was a reason for the rather convoluted php/js logic duplication in include_js.php? I should check with Mike on this
[05:39:26] <DaveMethvin> well i'm here ready to push out 1.7.2rc1 but have a coupla things i wanted to sort out before that
[05:39:30] <jzaefferer> The jquery jobs actually looks alright, just no irc notifications - waiting for johnbender to reply if we can just enable those again
[05:39:40] <jaubourg> ok
[05:39:57] <DaveMethvin> one is for you jaubourg, did you have any tix you wanted to fix before that?
[05:40:05] <DaveMethvin> didn't know if you got a chance to look through htem
[05:40:07] <DaveMethvin> them
[05:40:22] <jaubourg> I wanted to browse the ajax issues but didn't get the chance yet
[05:40:29] <jaubourg> had to fix this include_js.php thingy
[05:40:39] <DaveMethvin> is it borked, or just ugly?
[05:40:46] <jaubourg> found it ugly
[05:40:53] <jaubourg> didn't you see the new one?
[05:41:00] <jaubourg> soooo beautiful now :P
[05:41:33] <DaveMethvin> we're gonnna put a lot more lipstick on the build/test process for 1.8 so i'm not worried there
[05:41:41] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron is working on a grunt setup
[05:41:56] <DaveMethvin> sounds like jzaefferer already has one for ui
[05:42:18] <DaveMethvin> but if you could get the tickets sorted out asap that woudl be great
[05:42:37] <DaveMethvin> the other is a really annoying ie6 problem, it's crashing on some people on the unit tests
[05:42:43] <DaveMethvin> but not for me
[05:42:51] <DaveMethvin> it just goes black for rwaldron
[05:42:58] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: grunting
[05:43:08] <DaveMethvin> and rkatic had the same problem
[05:43:25] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/grunt/grunt.js
[05:44:11] <DaveMethvin> wow it's like shell script in javascript! :)
[05:46:34] <jzaefferer> Lot's of potential there to make it all a little prettier :-)
[05:47:51] <jaubourg> hey mike
[05:48:19] <jaubourg> sorry I pissed you off ;) and hi
[05:51:47] <jaubourg> mikesherov?
[06:09:51] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: mikesherov is on the train to work from about 8:15 to 9:00am so you probably caught him just as he was pulling into the station
[06:09:52] <bot-t> (3 hours 4 mins 30 secs ago) <jaubourg> tell DaveMethvin is there some kind of black hole sitting next to testswarm that makes it fail no matter what?
[06:10:11] <DaveMethvin> oh even bot-t was slacking off
[06:10:35] <DaveMethvin> you just can't get good bots these days
[06:13:35] <jaubourg> heh
[06:32:56] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: the lack of completion for all three ie 6/7/8 has me kinda worried http://swarm.jquery.org/job/978/ but when i run locally they all finish fine
[06:36:11] <jaubourg> yeah, I'm starting to think we may have to rethink out automated testing from scratch in the not so far future and I sure as hell aren't looking forward to this
[06:37:37] <jaubourg> I dunno, maybe we finally hit a critical mass in the size of our test suite
[06:39:59] <jaubourg> and one more unit test, one
[06:40:07] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/UmKkvA

[06:42:57] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: thanks for updating the milestone! i keep forgetting to do that myself and have to go back to see what ive closed recently
[06:43:31] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin, jaubourg I have a weird idea

[06:44:04] <jq-jenkins> j: Fixes #11426: getting the responseText of an xhr should be tried/caught because of IE's inability to give access to binary data. Unit test added.
[06:44:10] <DaveMethvin> julia roberts is not gonna wear a frog suit, so give it up rwaldron
[06:44:15] <DaveMethvin> or did you have a different idea
[06:44:26] <rwaldron> I came up with some crazy shit for the Ringmark tests, that allow me to run any test in a qunit suite without the suite ever knowing which test it will run
[06:44:40] <rwaldron> it takes advantage of the ?filter=foo
[06:44:55] <DaveMethvin> so like each test does its own setup?
[06:44:58] <rwaldron> i wonder if there is a way to run each module seperately, in sequential order
[06:45:14] <rwaldron> automated*
[06:45:28] <jaubourg> well, splitting tests may solve our issues with testswarm
[06:45:39] <DaveMethvin> i know this might be heresy, but maybe we are running too many tests
[06:45:39] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin jaubourg example: http://rng.io/suite/visual.html
[06:45:46] <rwaldron> see, no test
[06:46:05] <jaubourg> \o/ you broke your tests
[06:46:08] <jaubourg> ;)
[06:46:09] <rwaldron> http://rng.io/suite/visual.html?spec=webworkers
[06:46:27] <rwaldron> thats a bad example, there are no fixtures
[06:46:28] <rwaldron> one sec
[06:46:56] <rwaldron> here we go
[06:46:56] <rwaldron> http://rng.io/suite/visual.html?spec=hashchange
[06:47:05] <jaubourg> the real question is: could we have a proper report if we had separate runs per browser, per module in testswarm?
[06:47:17] <rwaldron> that loads an iframe that actually does a hashchange
[06:47:29] <rwaldron> anyway, just brainstorming
[06:47:46] <rwaldron> don't take this as me thinking I have the "one true solution"
[06:47:51] <rwaldron> most of this is crummy in opera
[06:47:54] <jaubourg> yeah, I'm leaning toward we have too many tests at once like DaveMethvin
[06:47:55] * rwaldron shrugs
[06:48:02] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i definitely think we need to reexamine everything
[06:48:04] <rwaldron> jaubourg DaveMethvin +1
[06:48:11] <rwaldron> so, that's what I'm saying
[06:48:16] <rwaldron> I wonder if there is a way to say...
[06:48:22] <rwaldron> 1. Core
[06:48:24] <rwaldron> 2. ...
[06:48:28] <rwaldron> separately
[06:48:40] <rwaldron> but automattically
[06:48:41] <jaubourg> yes, run them in separate iframes, join the results ?
[06:48:49] <rwaldron> something like that, yes!
[06:49:03] <rwaldron> because if we're doing it right, this should be no issue
[06:49:06] <rwaldron> a unit is a unit
[06:49:20] <DaveMethvin> right, there shouldn't be leakage across tests anyway
[06:49:31] <rwaldron> it might also expose some Bad Parts™
[06:49:36] <rwaldron> that we can fix
[06:49:47] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ++
[06:50:17] <jaubourg> like start core, wait for it to finish, then module1, then module2... problem is I have no clue how testswarm extracts info from qunit... but heh, simply cloning dom nodesc could work I suppose
[06:50:18] <rwaldron> now, snover actually laid the ground work quite well for ensuring no leaks across tests with dom elements
[06:50:25] <rwaldron> so that's a step in the right direction
[06:50:31] <rwaldron> jaubourg exactly
[06:50:33] <DaveMethvin> right
[06:52:01] <rwaldron> also, for ringmark, we needed to be able to use dom fixtures in more then one place
[06:52:27] <rwaldron> ie. needed in the w3c compatible tests, the qunit compatible tests and the site's ring-runner
[06:52:39] <jaubourg> ?#11264
[06:52:41] <bot-t> [#11264] evalScript() uses defaults set by ajaxSetup() (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/11264
[06:53:01] <jaubourg> do I go about setting all the proper options?
[06:53:16] <rwaldron> so the part of test/index.html that has all of the fixture html could be put into its own file
[06:53:31] <rwaldron> and used to build >1 suite
[06:53:56] <rwaldron> Suites: All the things, Ordered Execution of the Things
[06:54:16] <rwaldron> (again, I don't know if this is the answer, I'm just ranting ideas)
[06:54:33] <jaubourg> a test suite launching test suites... would be cool and we would be able to use another page for this, actually not changing the way testing works locally
[06:54:42] <rwaldron> exacttly!!!
[06:54:44] <rwaldron> :D
[06:54:53] <rwaldron> jaubourg are we mind-linking this morning?
[06:55:06] <jaubourg> could be ;)
[06:55:20] <jaubourg> anyway, the dog needs some walking
[06:55:24] <jaubourg> bbiab
[06:55:39] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: do you think I should attempt to fix #11264?
[06:55:42] <rwaldron> dog??
[06:55:49] <rwaldron> when did you get a dog?
[06:55:50] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: can you?
[06:56:00] <jaubourg> I can make it less broken
[06:56:07] <jaubourg> does it count as fixed?
[06:56:08] <DaveMethvin> i am glad my dog can't read, he would get excited by the word "walk"
[06:56:15] <jaubourg> hehe
[06:56:21] <DaveMethvin> can you override the POST?
[06:56:24] <jaubourg> rwaldron: my gf has an english bulldog
[06:56:26] <DaveMethvin> i didn't look at the code
[06:56:34] <DaveMethvin> but it did seem unusual
[06:56:38] <jaubourg> she's stubborn as hell but a very kind dog
[06:56:41] <DaveMethvin> frankly, global options suck
[06:56:59] <DaveMethvin> BECAUSE THEY ARE GLOBAL
[06:57:20] <jaubourg> yeah, I wanted to have name "type" of globals, which would have been perfect for this situation but code was already too bloated (ajax rewrite)
[06:57:33] <rwaldron> jaubourg btw... this is what github did with you commit message
[06:57:34] <rwaldron> http://gyazo.com/c06464f1204fd7af43e4c789e61476a0
[06:57:37] <rwaldron> hahaha
[06:57:46] <DaveMethvin> it would be much better for ppl to wrap their own ajax calls with their custom options
[06:58:05] <rwaldron> jaubourg what's the dog's name?
[06:58:12] <jaubourg> pinkie
[06:58:17] <rwaldron> hahaha
[06:58:26] <rwaldron> "pinkie" the english bulldog
[06:58:28] <rwaldron> <3
[06:58:38] <jaubourg> yeah a girl's name for a girl's dog
[06:58:45] <rwaldron> too cute
[06:59:04] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg has an english bulldog, rwaldron has a french bulldog, YER DOIN IT RONG
[06:59:14] <jaubourg> bwahahahaha
[06:59:15] <rwaldron> hahahahahahaahahahaha
[06:59:22] <rwaldron> jaubourg ^5
[06:59:23] <jaubourg> note there are american bulldogs
[06:59:30] <jaubourg> maybe jorn should have one
[06:59:35] <rwaldron> ahahaha
[06:59:37] <rwaldron> hilarious
[06:59:47] <DaveMethvin> are they overweight and think obama was born in indonesia?
[06:59:56] <jaubourg> probably
[07:00:01] <kswedberg> jaubourg: "she's stubborn as hell…" that's not a nice thing to say about your girlfriend.
[07:00:13] <DaveMethvin> ba-dum-pum!
[07:00:14] * jaubourg spanks karl
[07:00:30] <kswedberg> :D and hi jaubourg!
[07:00:36] <jaubourg> well, to be fair, my gf is probably more stubborn than the dog...
[07:00:44] <jaubourg> and hi Karl \o/
[07:00:50] <DaveMethvin> at least you don't have to pick up her poop though
[07:00:53] <jaubourg> anyway, gotta walk pinkie
[07:00:59] <rwaldron> kswedberg shows up for the zingers
[07:01:07] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: now THAT's dirty :P
[07:01:24] <rwaldron> nothing dirty about it... use a mutt mitt
[07:01:26] <rwaldron> DUH
[07:01:28] <DaveMethvin> i have a dog and three cats, sometimes i feel like my main job is managing poop
[07:01:28] <rwaldron> :D
[07:01:37] <kswedberg> hi rwaldron
[07:01:38] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin AAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
[07:01:48] * rwaldron hugs kswedberg
[07:02:09] <rwaldron> I just realized... jqconf is coming soon, right?
[07:02:32] <kswedberg> sometime in late June, methinks
[07:02:39] <rwaldron> wow, late June?
[07:02:46] <rwaldron> that's different
[07:03:06] <kswedberg> don't quote me on that, but that was last I heard.
[07:03:13] <jaubourg> that late?
[07:03:31] <jaubourg> my gf took vacations in May so that she could come with me :/
[07:03:44] <jaubourg> she has to take them very early
[07:03:56] <kswedberg> I haven't been up to speed on the latest goings on, so could be totally wrong. but that's my recollection.
[07:04:08] <ajpiano> yes, late june
[07:04:09] <jaubourg> k, good to knowanyway
[07:04:19] <jaubourg> now, I gotta walk the dog for real
[07:04:21] <jaubourg> and hi adam
[07:04:22] <kswedberg> thx ajpiano.
[07:04:41] <ajpiano> hi jaubourg :)
[07:04:46] <kswedberg> ajpiano: btw, I hate you and your evil WWF ways
[07:04:57] <kswedberg> <3
[07:05:00] <jaubourg> hey, if any of you would mail me the probable dates that would help me a lot
[07:05:01] <ajpiano> haha sorry kswedberg i was surprised that BOUSY was good
[07:05:20] <ajpiano> jaubourg: 28-29
[07:05:35] <rwaldron> ajpiano definite?
[07:06:00] <kswedberg> hey man, if WWF says it's good, it's good. anyway, ajpiano, I'm convinced WWF has it out for me. all i ever get is vowels. sigh
[07:06:43] <ajpiano> rwaldron: pretty much
[07:07:12] <rwaldron> thank you sir
[07:15:56] <jaubourg> woah, it's like a storm outside
[07:16:04] <jaubourg> poor dog was totally wet
[07:16:25] <jaubourg> happy to be able to run into the mud though... dogs
[07:16:33] <jaubourg> thanks ajpiano
[07:19:42] <jaubourg> ajpiano: does it mean jqcon boston will also be later? or that we only have one jqcon this year?
[07:19:54] <ajpiano> we aren't in fact sure yet
[07:20:05] <jaubourg> ok
[07:42:26] <jaubourg> damnit
[07:42:31] <jaubourg> who removed evalScript and inlined it?
[07:43:04] <jaubourg> or am I blind now
[07:43:50] <jaubourg> no no no... evalScript inlined :(
[07:44:00] <jaubourg> I guess gaining 2 bytes was too tempting

[08:15:04] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez ummmm
[08:15:15] <danheberden> noon est i think is what we said?
[08:20:51] <jaubourg> that's what she said
[08:24:55] <danheberden> "you wanna deploy me baby?"
[08:29:40] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> I sent a message a few hours ago about it on Skype, but the brilliant developers of Skype have decided the message should not go to anyone until everyone is online...

[08:44:48] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez ah, i sees it!
[08:45:38] <mikesherov> is trac down?
[08:46:38] <danheberden> mikesherov seems good for me?
[08:46:40] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin ><
[08:46:44] <jaubourg> I always test locally
[08:46:46] <mikesherov> oh, it's fine now
[08:46:48] <danheberden> but, then, i feed it bug snakcs
[08:46:51] <danheberden> *snacks
[08:46:59] <danheberden> ?snack
[08:47:11] <danheberden> ?botsnack
[08:47:14] <mikesherov> I got a "temporarily unavailable" message before
[08:47:17] <danheberden> what the hell bot-t
[08:47:38] <danheberden> mikesherov yeah, it's running as fcgi, which is *Stellar*
[08:47:40] <DaveMethvin> hey at least bot-t shuts up, unlike that jenkins guy
[08:48:50] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: yeah i got a few of those too ... kind of strange because it didn't seem like they were coming from the server
[08:48:57] <jaubourg> ffffuuuuu
[08:49:26] <danheberden> jabourgeous
[08:49:31] <DaveMethvin> Errrrrrrrrrr! http://swarm.jquery.org/job/995/
[08:49:53] <DaveMethvin> we should change that to Deeeerp
[08:50:35] <DaveMethvin> bot-t: you feelin better?
[08:50:48] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, Without a doubt.
[08:51:13] <danheberden> ?botsnack
[08:51:13] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[08:51:17] <jaubourg> so firefox is blocking right in the middle of the ajax tests
[08:51:20] <jaubourg> ffffuuuuu
[08:51:44] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: yep, in the recent versions of ff it seems like the timeouts are not working
[08:52:29] <DaveMethvin> i bumped up the timeouts on some tests and it seemed to help
[08:52:48] <DaveMethvin> but it's kinda scary, we'd need to add a lot of dead time in order to make it work reliably
[08:53:27] <DaveMethvin> another possible vote for unit tests in iframes? at least that way they could run in parallel
[08:54:02] <danheberden> DaveMethvin are there any cons to that?
[08:54:12] <jaubourg> I think I got it
[08:54:14] <DaveMethvin> no doubt
[08:54:18] <jaubourg> but god is it strange
[08:54:23] <danheberden> twss
[08:54:28] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: timeouts are borked in newer FF
[08:54:44] <DaveMethvin> mainly when the window is out of focus
[08:54:50] <DaveMethvin> which we can't seem to control
[08:55:02] <mikesherov> right, so FF changed granularity of setTimeout when window is not focused
[08:55:08] <danheberden> Wait, they eff with timeouts on focus leave?
[08:55:10] <DaveMethvin> we were depending on 50ms timeouts
[08:55:12] <danheberden> wow
[08:55:24] <jaubourg> I think it's more stupid than that
[08:55:25] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/t-gIBA
[08:55:25] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Prevents firefox from hanging on the test (could it be that firefox passes the delay to start?). - jaubourg
[08:55:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah danheberden, any timeout of less than 1 second is extended to 1 second if the window isn't visible
[08:55:57] <jaubourg> setTimeout, in FF, will give the number of ms "late" iirc
[08:56:10] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: i think they finally took that "feature" out
[08:56:10] <jaubourg> and that's probably what's breaking stuff
[08:56:16] <danheberden> i guess that's cool in it's own right, but, like, as a new api would be better
[08:56:22] <danheberden> smartTImeout or something
[08:56:22] <jaubourg> def
[08:56:27] <danheberden> but what do we know?
[08:56:34] <DaveMethvin> bend over
[08:56:48] * danheberden feels a draft
[08:57:03] <DaveMethvin> the reason they hosed setTimeout was to prevent people from having their background windows burn up cpu time
[08:57:17] <mikesherov> which is stupid
[08:57:27] <danheberden> yeah, fuck those cpu's
[08:57:27] <DaveMethvin> it's a noble goal but breaks all the rules of programming physics
[08:57:35] <DaveMethvin> time dilation
[08:57:58] <danheberden> i think it's a cool idea, just not, like, messing with the time continuum
[08:58:03] <jaubourg> I'd like linux to do the same thing, just to see those browser devs face
[08:58:16] <jaubourg> "omg, my timeouts dunnot work in C anymore wtf?"
[08:58:31] <jaubourg> maybe that would make them realize
[08:58:53] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #278: STILL FAILING in 3 min 21 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/278/
[08:58:54] <jq-jenkins> j: Prevents firefox from hanging on the test (could it be that firefox passes the delay to start?).
[08:58:59] <DaveMethvin> silly jaubourg, don't you know that javascript isn't REAL code? :)
[08:59:46] <DaveMethvin> especially your last coupla commits http://swarm.jquery.org/job/995/ :P
[09:04:11] <jaubourg> damnit, what did I do again?
[09:04:53] <mikesherov> so, no, really, what are we supposed to do about setTimeout?
[09:05:15] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: well i was just giving up and adding a bunch of extra delays
[09:05:32] <DaveMethvin> so instead of 100ms/200ms i was doing 1000ms/2000ms
[09:05:44] <DaveMethvin> making sure no timeout in the test was <1sec
[09:05:49] <DaveMethvin> not sure what else to do
[09:06:09] <DaveMethvin> but i was hoping someone else could come up with a better solution
[09:06:25] <jaubourg> I think it's the setTimeout( start, xxx ) format that's the problem: setTimeout( function() { start(); }, xxx ) fixed it for me
[09:06:52] <DaveMethvin> wonder why
[09:06:53] <jaubourg> I dunno what FF passes as argument/context for the callback but it seems to be the problem
[09:07:06] <DaveMethvin> OH now i see why you mentioned that
[09:07:23] <DaveMethvin> and yeah, it makes sense that ff is barfing
[09:07:46] <DaveMethvin> you're right, they pass a non-std "milliseconds of your life that you lost by me being late" to the function
[09:08:14] <DaveMethvin> i just saw a bugzilla ticket closed about that, must be for post-ff10
[09:08:26] <jaubourg> heh
[09:08:38] <jaubourg> we could redefine qunit's start in init.js?
[09:08:46] <DaveMethvin> oh and i think if we upgraded to QUnit 1.3 it might go away
[09:08:57] <DaveMethvin> i don't think QUnit start takes an arg anymore
[09:10:07] <jaubourg> \o/
[09:10:19] <DaveMethvin> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=394769  fixed in FF13
[09:11:16] <jaubourg> hmmm
[09:11:45] <mikesherov> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=66078
[09:12:51] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: looks like QUnit/master still uses the start() arg: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/qunit/qunit.js#L385
[09:14:24] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: oh boy, more timer chaos ... i've got a bad feeling about all this
[09:14:41] <DaveMethvin> that's why we had to back out requestAnimationFrame
[09:14:51] <DaveMethvin> none of this stuff matches developer expectations
[09:15:17] <DaveMethvin> they are free to change the rules but they'd better let eveyone know, we are NOT going to take the heat on this
[09:16:47] <jaubourg> I think it's all about setTimeout providing arguments
[09:16:57] <jaubourg> I'll hotfix in testinit.js
[09:17:01] <ajpiano> glwtd DaveMethvin
[09:17:20] <ajpiano> "I thought the point of jQuery was to deal with all these cross browser inconsistencies. Please fix this."
[09:18:27] <mikesherov> http://codereview.chromium.org/6577021/patch/1/2
[09:19:00] <mikesherov> Hey, it's consistent... in Chrome and FF... http://www.sadtrombone.com
[09:19:29] <DaveMethvin> c'mon mikesherov, changing a number from 0.004 to 1.000 can't make THAT much difference can it?
[09:20:31] <jaubourg> lol
[09:20:42] <DaveMethvin> like i said i totally understand why they're doing this, but it has a bunch of ripple effects, including the ajpiano-alikes who will expect jQuery to somehow protect them from this  madness in the name of cross-browser consistency
[09:21:06] <jaubourg> ok, hotfix seems to make ff happy
[09:21:26] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: we'll let Jenkins be the judge of that :P
[09:21:39] <ajpiano> cmon DaveMethvin if you like at biology it's clear that something becoming 250 times larger rarely has any effect on how it works
[09:21:49] <DaveMethvin> twss
[09:21:51] <ajpiano> look at*
[09:22:04] <DaveMethvin> ?tell jq-jenkins BLAME JAUBOURG

[09:28:41] <DaveMethvin> that worked pretty well!
[09:29:03] <jaubourg> I can't even make sense of the graph :P
[09:29:24] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/999/
[09:29:32] <DaveMethvin> ok so lemme look at this thang
[09:30:05] <jaubourg> I have to fly... I'll be back later though
[09:30:17] <jaubourg> this is crazy, everything works locally
[09:30:45] <jaubourg> the 5929 tests, all passing
[09:30:52] <mikesherov> locally
[09:30:54] <mikesherov> file://
[09:31:01] <jaubourg> no, local server
[09:31:02] <mikesherov> I HATE file://
[09:31:44] <jaubourg> ok gotta fly$
[09:31:47] <jaubourg> cya around guys
[09:32:17] <DaveMethvin> works with localhost too mikesherov
[09:33:57] <mikesherov> interesting
[09:34:43] <DaveMethvin> oh.. i wonder if the swarm is backlogged, lemme check
[09:35:22] <DaveMethvin> nope, that's the most recent commit
[09:40:57] <eddiemonge> paul_irish: wasnt there a thing from google that showed chrome's upgrade adoption rate?
[09:43:13] <epm> I have a "can it be done with jquery" question (and I'm fairly new to jquery, so bear with me)
[09:44:29] <eddiemonge> epm: if its not core jquery development related, you should ask it in #jquery
[09:44:57] <epm> Ok - thanks eddiemonge
[11:47:30] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: last night?
[11:47:52] <DaveMethvin> it was wonderful gnarf, the flowers, the wine, everything
[11:48:03] <DaveMethvin> oh, you mean the other thing?
[11:48:09] <gnarf> you pinged :)
[11:48:19] <DaveMethvin> oh then nevermind about what i just said
[11:48:42] <DaveMethvin> so anyway, i was tryna figure out these test failures on firefox
[11:48:48] <DaveMethvin> just looking for some brainstorming help
[11:48:57] <DaveMethvin> when ff is hidden they stretch out the timeouts
[11:49:12] <DaveMethvin> and we have a bunch of setTimeouts with sub-1-second times
[11:49:20] <DaveMethvin> so our unit tests have been really flakey
[11:49:20] <gnarf> yeah
[11:49:41] <gnarf> the swarm version of FF shouldn't ever be "out of focus" tho
[11:49:45] <gnarf> so it should catch them
[11:49:48] <DaveMethvin> you'd think
[11:49:57] <DaveMethvin> but it doesn't seem so
[11:50:05] <DaveMethvin> or perhaps it is breaking for some other reason
[11:50:10] <DaveMethvin> lemme find one
[11:51:09] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=5607&client_id=10503 gnarf
[11:51:54] <DaveMethvin> i dunno, maybe i am mis-diagnosing them
[11:52:12] <DaveMethvin> at the moment, some changes jaubourg put in are breaking the unit tests
[11:52:13] <gnarf> seems like the correct diagnosis
[11:52:37] <DaveMethvin> so i need to figure those out: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/999/
[11:53:41] <DaveMethvin> all the tests run fine locally but i wanted to get a relatively clean swarm run before putting out 1.7.2rc1
[12:36:08] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/nX1nxg

[12:38:47] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #280: STILL FAILING in 2 min 30 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/280/
[12:38:47] <jq-jenkins> dave.methvin: Revert "No more php/js logic duplication..." on a hunch.
[12:40:40] <DaveMethvin> you just keep havin those hunches, dave
[12:42:49] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, i wonder what was wrong with that php commit
[13:07:08] <DaveMethvin> hey waitaminit, why is our testswarm Chrome version 15?
[13:07:25] <DaveMethvin> why i oughta...
[13:15:09] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin that shit was probably caused by include_js.php not serving the the correct headers
[13:15:30] <rwaldron> maybe I'm crazzzy
[13:15:49] <rwaldron> window.hasPHP = false /* <?php echo "*" + "/ || true /*"; ?> */;
[13:16:17] <DaveMethvin> well backing out the commit fixed it, which was ok with me since it wasn't essential atm
[13:16:36] <DaveMethvin> i didn't want to try and suss it out
[13:16:36] <rwaldron> sounds good
[13:17:14] <DaveMethvin> obtw, i got an interesting fail that was similar to the one you had in ie6 rwaldron
[13:17:24] <rwaldron> orly?
[13:17:36] <DaveMethvin> the support body-background test made ie9 go wonky
[13:17:45] <DaveMethvin> but when i cleared the cache everything was happy
[13:18:05] <rwaldron> interesting...
[13:18:24] <DaveMethvin> so if you get a chance you might try clearing the cache
[15:36:19] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: so it was include_js.php Oo weird
[17:11:53] <Krinkle> jaubourg: I left a comment, that might be touching the cause
[17:11:54] <bot-t> (15 hours 40 mins ago) <jzaefferer> tell krinkle TestSwarm v0.2.0 is tagged
[17:12:04] <Krinkle> Oh nice :)
[17:12:27] <Krinkle> why didn't it say that earlier :(
[17:12:27] <Krinkle> (I know I know why)
[17:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: $( [] ).fadeIn(function() { // never runs }); :-(
[17:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> Is this known and/or intentional?
[17:17:50] <DaveMethvin> i believe the callback calls for each element, right?
[17:18:01] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, right.
[17:18:11] <DaveMethvin> so how may times should it run for 0 elements? :P
[17:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously the answer is 1. :-P
[17:18:29] <DaveMethvin> dwim!
[17:18:38] <DaveMethvin> i think this has come up before
[17:18:53] <scott_gonzalez> It makes sense.
[17:18:53] <DaveMethvin> if you know it's 0 maybe you could add a fake element or something...
[17:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I was foolishly thinking of running something at the end regardless of # of elems.
[17:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> My code is just wrong.
[17:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> Is this was .promise() is for?
[17:20:17] <DaveMethvin> that might work
[17:20:29] <DaveMethvin> brb
[17:21:19] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG, you can pass a jQuery object to $.when() ?!?
[17:22:02] <scott_gonzalez> I should pay more attention.
[17:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> Using .promise() works.
[17:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[17:34:27] <Krinkle> Why are there 22 instances of most browsers in swarm ?
[17:34:43] <Krinkle> isn't that a little overkill? or is there something wrong with the browserstack automated script we use
[17:38:15] <Krinkle> IE6 is failing right now due to syntax errors it seems
[17:42:55] <Krinkle> Can someone with login to swarm jquery account remove some jobs before 8d94ed91e47f68f742b6c282c8de40eb5fa8e140 ? They are all going to fail and time out and causing swarm clients to have to re-run each test in each module 4 times for each commit
[18:01:36] <jaubourg> Krinkle: t'was corrected in a subsequent commit: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/014b2a57007c4fd2bc85397f83fe36eec88aa975
