[12:07:48] <dhardison> trying to load some binary data via ajax and getting an error in chrome: Failed to read the 'responseText' property from 'XMLHttpRequest': The value is only accessible if the object's 'responseType' is '' or 'text' (was 'blob') --- jquery line 8604
[12:08:04] <dhardison> looks like typeof xhr.responseText is throwing the error... 
[13:21:59] <m_gol> the worst morons in the whole world must be creating airline sites
[13:22:42] <m_gol> this is a completely new level of f***ing everything up, you have to try to mess it up so bad as they're doing
[13:22:58] <m_gol> I'm amazed
[13:25:37] <m_gol> what do you do if there's an error with processing credit card payment? try again? no, it's better to redirect to the main site & have to find the connection & enter all the info again :/
