[13:08:26] <m_gol> markelog: I'd like to land the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/3073 (that shouldn't require a PR) and run the test on updated browsers so I can handle removing Yandex from the swarm (unless you're doing it now)
[13:09:39] <markelog> m_gol: ok-ok, be careful with the browserstack though
[13:09:47] <markelog> although, i know you will anyways :)
[13:47:24] <m_gol> yeah, I'll wait for the test run to finish, just in case :-)
[13:55:46] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[13:55:58] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[13:56:07] <m_gol> should the 3.0 upgrade guide be already live?
[13:56:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i figured it didn't hurt
[13:56:58] <m_gol> ok, I'm asking because we have the jquery-3 branch there with related changes, I'd like to avoid major conflicts
[13:57:10] <m_gol> but this is a new file so perhaps it's fine
[13:57:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah i won't add it to that branch so it should merge cleanly
[13:57:38] <DaveMethvin> this file isn't linked from anywhere right now 
[13:57:58] <m_gol> I bet someone will find it :-)
[13:58:07] <DaveMethvin> which is fine
[13:58:07] <m_gol> the URL is intuitive if you know the 1.9 one
[13:58:09] <m_gol> k
[13:58:59] <m_gol> I forgot to mention one thing at the meeting
[13:59:31] <m_gol> I've just looked at https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards/index.html and Android 2.3 usage is down from 4% last time we checked (a few months ago) to 2.6%
[14:00:33] <m_gol> The text "The limited Android 2.3 support may not correct minor known issues with positioning" is very mild, it may have many more issues now that we almost don't test it :-)
[14:00:56] <m_gol> not sure if it's worth all the trouble, really; it will be another month before we release the final etc.
