[09:17:56] <ajpiano> danheberden, we should track down this guy
[09:18:10] <ajpiano> "
[09:18:10] <ajpiano> This should be easy to sabotage/fix for the real jQuery.com guys. Since the fake .it-site hotlinks directly to the css and custom javascript from jquery.com they can add some code that will warn users that the site is a fake, automatically redirect all traffic to jquery.com with a 301, add canonical headers etc...
[09:19:45] <danheberden> yeah, it shouldn't be hard at all - i was more worried about some legal issue
[09:19:57] <ajpiano> ya
[09:19:59] <danheberden> like inability to pursue if we did that re: tm stuff
[09:20:05] <ajpiano> he he just makes it sound like lickety split
[09:20:28] <danheberden> i think if we deny access, the need to say "this site is fake" might be a next step
[09:20:41] <danheberden> if he's copying the site and it suddenly is dead, the mirror will breka
[09:20:46] <danheberden> *break
[09:22:56] <ajpiano> danheberden: alex just had an interesting idea on cabal
[09:23:07] <danheberden> ya
[09:23:17] <danheberden> but google will stil get it
[09:23:44] <danheberden> so i think ip based would be the best route?
[09:23:59] <ajpiano> yeah, probably
[09:24:07] <ajpiano> his solution seems like just "get 'em off the site now"
[09:24:18] <danheberden> what is your opinion of having some kind of replacement page?
[09:24:24] <danheberden> as dev-rel lead, that's your boat to steer
[09:26:13] <ajpiano> as in, "you've just been redirected from a bunch of shady leeches?"
[09:29:47] <danheberden> or "omg, remember that one time when you got to the wrong site because they copied the legitimate site you WANTED just to make money with google ads? OMG THAT WAS AWESOME"
[09:30:00] <ajpiano> seems like overkill, we should just redirect them if we can
[09:33:25] <danheberden> so a 401 with javascript redirect?
[09:36:23] <ajpiano> sounds goood for now
[09:48:42] <danheberden> ajpiano can you visit the blog for me - just make sure it's working properly
[09:49:01] <ajpiano> ours or .it ?
[09:49:12] <danheberden> ours
[09:49:18] <danheberden> just making sure the redirect isn't playin funny
[09:49:23] <ajpiano> seems fine to me
[09:49:26] <danheberden> cool
[09:54:38] <danheberden> ajpiano don't forget -m for grid meeting? or is that off today
[09:55:03] <ajpiano> lol good point
[11:00:46] <danheberden> ajpiano jquery.com and blog.jquery.com blocked
[11:00:53] <ajpiano> awes
[11:00:53] <danheberden> with js redirect
[11:01:47] <miketaylr> what about code.jquery.com
[11:02:02] <danheberden> unfortunately, we can't do anything with static or code
[11:02:09] <danheberden> since it's a cdn
[11:02:09] <miketaylr> ah
[11:02:17] <miketaylr> nuke it from orbit
[11:02:27] <danheberden> we can add the location check and redirect in our custom.js on the homepage tho
[11:02:30] <danheberden> SOL!!!!!!
[11:03:34] <danheberden> now i think we need some kind of update
[11:03:57] <ajpiano> could write a short blog post being like
[11:04:07] <miketaylr> can we replace http://static.jquery.com/favicon.ico with a goatse favicon?
[11:04:08] <danheberden> i wonder if a comment might be enoguh?
[11:04:12] <danheberden> hahahaha
[11:04:21] <danheberden> miketaylr cdn :/
[11:04:26] <miketaylr> STUPID CND
[11:04:30] <miketaylr> CDN too
[11:05:01] <miketaylr> (sorry canadian dollar)
[11:05:25] <danheberden> hmm, there's a comment on blog.jquery.com that hasn't been updated by jquery.it from 4:55am
[11:05:34] <danheberden> it has teh one from yesterday though, so it might update daily
[11:07:22] <ajpiano> hum
[11:07:28] <ajpiano> donnno how often they scrape
[11:07:36] <ajpiano> danheberden fyi see docs#9760
[11:07:37] <bot-t> [#9760] What is jQuery.it? (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/9760
[11:09:22] <danheberden> wat
[11:09:49] <danheberden> sry, pulling from git just freaked out on jquery.com :/
[11:14:23] <danheberden> sweet - k, jquery.com has a source change
[11:14:39] <danheberden> last thing - do we add a redirect in the js?
[11:17:16] <ajpiano> i am for it
[11:17:19] <ajpiano> screw those guys
[11:20:47] <danheberden> ajpiano look good? http://jsfiddle.net/danheberden/hWzzh/
[11:21:58] <ajpiano> haha yeah
[11:22:09] <ajpiano> i, for one, am not interested in it being particularly graceful
[11:22:11] <ajpiano> just pwning
[11:22:23] <danheberden> lets see what this looks like :)
[11:22:31] <ajpiano> like if we add this, and it works, and then he makes a change to "fix" it
[11:22:40] <ajpiano> then at least we'll know we've got a live fish on the other end of the line
[11:26:32] <danheberden> HAHAHAHA fuckers
[11:28:11] <danheberden> thank god gmail updates threads
[11:28:17] <danheberden> i was about to post that update

[15:41:07] <marcosa> hello, Does somebody use jqgrid? I have one question
[22:01:49] <addyosmani> bot-t: tell rwaldron have you had a chance to look at the docs item in #8142? Just wondering if the page you reference putting together is something external to the api site / this should still have needsdocs status.
[22:01:49] <bot-t> addyosmani, Okay.
