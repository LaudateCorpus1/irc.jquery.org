[09:38:16] <Krinkle> yeah, nginx gone away
[09:38:43] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[09:39:14] <DaveMethvin> btw, getting ready for the 2.0 beta right now...everyone clear of master? gibson042 rwaldron?
[09:39:50] <gibson042> I've got nothing going on with it
[09:40:06] <DaveMethvin> neither does swarmy :D
[09:43:20] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: makes sense
[09:43:32] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: though we need to fix that stupid nginx anyway
[09:43:39] <Krinkle> yeah
[09:43:59] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: So at least we know what isn't the problem. it isn't php, and it wasn't git-view taking up cpu in the background
[09:44:11] <Krinkle> (eventhough that certainly was *a* problem, it wasn't *the* the problem)
[09:44:16] <Krinkle> I'm checking db now.
[09:44:32] <Krinkle> making a clean start (aside the old db) to see if it does anything.
[09:44:38] <Krinkle> see # -infra

[09:46:13] <DaveMethvin> maybe i'll just bareback this release
[09:46:42] <Krinkle> oh, hai, DaveMethvin. This should only take a few minutes. Sorry for the inconvinience.
[09:46:57] <DaveMethvin> np i have to clean up the bug list
[09:49:00] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin +1
[09:49:06] <rwaldron> (to beta release)
[09:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin gnarf: re: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12821 It'd be nice if core could split out tests for methods that jQuery UI overrides into their own file(s).
[09:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> Then we could pull in those tests as part of the UI tests.
[09:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure how much of a hassle that would be though, for either project.
[09:52:29] <DaveMethvin> sorry about the trac spam...trying to get the milestones clean up only a few more left
[09:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> This is nothing compared to the stuff we do with UI trac :-P
[09:53:13] <DaveMethvin> well if people would stop claiming tickets and then not getting them done ... :D
[09:53:14] <scott_gonzalez> But we're down to 369 tickets!
[09:53:52] <scott_gonzalez> Must be nice to be <70.
[09:54:22] <DaveMethvin> barely ... oh you mean the tickets and not my age
[09:54:28] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:54:40] <DaveMethvin> seems like more than 70 tix
[09:54:55] <scott_gonzalez> Not according to ticketgraph.
[09:54:59] <DaveMethvin> once you get down low there are these ones that just wont' go away
[09:55:28] <scott_gonzalez> You need to just close or give in and spend a month making huge changes and breaking other stuff :-P
[09:55:49] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking this as i was moving those milestones
[09:59:22] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1
[09:59:46] <DaveMethvin> WE'RE #1 !!!!!!
[10:03:12] <Krinkle> All browsers are done
[10:03:17] <Krinkle> IE6 just finished the first test
[10:03:29] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery 1.x Core build #83: STILL FAILING in 6 min 54 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%201.x%20Core/83/
[10:03:30] <Krinkle> wtf just happened
[10:03:52] <Krinkle> who edited localSettings.json back to database=testswarm ?
[10:03:59] <DaveMethvin> um, not me
[10:04:06] <DaveMethvin> the job is GONE!
[10:04:13] <Krinkle> Yes
[10:05:06] <Krinkle> gnarf: jzaefferer: ryanneufeld: did any of you edit jq03:/var/www/swarm/config/localSetting.json
[10:05:17] <Krinkle> exactly 2 minutes ago
[10:05:44] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #725: STILL FAILING in 2 min 15 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/725/
[10:05:48] <Krinkle> revertign that whoever did it
[10:07:35] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I didn't touch it since gnarf and me put it into puppet
[10:07:44] <Krinkle> oh crap
[10:07:46] <Krinkle> that must be it
[10:07:53] <Krinkle> puppet is overwriting it?
[10:08:14] <Krinkle> That's why I did it differently in my branch in infrastructure
[10:08:29] <Krinkle> I made it pull from 2 files in localSettings.*php*
[10:08:42] <Krinkle> one from puppet for db settings
[10:08:47] <Krinkle> one maintained locally with ua stuff
[10:08:55] <Krinkle> unless we want to do it all from puppet
[10:11:37] <Krinkle> anyway, apparently I just cleared out our real database, not the copy. since dbClearJobsAndClients.php reads from the json file, which I edited to point to testswarm2, but puppet reverted before I ran it.
[10:11:37] <Krinkle> :)
[10:11:45] <Krinkle> Luckily I backuped the user table
[10:11:47] <Krinkle> but the rest is gone
[10:12:00] <DaveMethvin> no problem, we can make more
[10:12:10] <gnarf> Krinkle: it's in puppet
[10:12:13] <gnarf> i think
[10:12:15] <DaveMethvin> you  mean all our failures have been covered up?
[10:12:20] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[10:12:23] <gnarf> localSettings.json that is
[10:12:29] <gnarf> not sure
[10:12:30] <Krinkle> gnarf: yeah
[10:12:36] <gnarf> it should have a comment saying so?
[10:12:47] <Krinkle> Yep
[10:12:48] <gnarf> feel free to commit your change to puppet
[10:12:51] <gnarf> and puppet agent --test
[10:12:54] <gnarf> after the hook fires
[10:12:57] <Krinkle> Though it needs to be valid json
[10:13:02] <Krinkle> so a _ property on top or something
[10:13:03] <Krinkle> anyway
[10:13:07] <Krinkle> details :P
[10:13:14] <Krinkle> 	"usage": "This file is controlled by Puppet, manual changes will be overwritten!", 
[10:13:16] <Krinkle> of course it has
[10:13:17] <gnarf> yeah, i think we did "puppet": "will overwrite this file" or something
[10:13:41] <DaveMethvin> "mystery":"solved"
[10:13:45] <Krinkle> and I read over it, because we always made local changes and I wouldn't implement something in puppet that overwrites a file we change all the time.
[10:14:01] <Krinkle> browser sets, user agents etc
[10:14:23] <Krinkle> lets discuss that later
[10:16:27] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #726: STILL FAILING in 5 min 45 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/726/
[10:16:51] <Krinkle> okay, so we've crossed off that as well
[10:17:01] <Krinkle> baby database does not help a bit
[10:17:08] <Krinkle> it just snafu'ed again
[10:17:15] <Krinkle> gateway, nginx gone away
[10:17:42] <Krinkle> gnarf: Something is seriously haunting that server.
[10:17:58] <Krinkle> we have a < 1KB database
[10:18:02] <Krinkle> almost 0 traffic
[10:18:09] <Krinkle> wtf just happened?
[10:21:20] <gnarf> no clue
[10:21:30] <gnarf> i can order us a new machine to throw something on
[10:21:39] <gnarf> try to pull apart services and move em
[10:22:43] <gnarf> ill see if we can't pull it off early next week
[10:23:01] <gnarf> try to separate jenkins & testswarm 
[10:23:05] <gnarf> both are pretty heavy
[10:23:36] <DaveMethvin> how can they be *that* heavy?
[10:23:53] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: it doesn't take very heavy when running out of ram kills random processes
[10:23:58] <gnarf> and there is 0 swap
[10:24:05] <DaveMethvin> oh
[10:24:43] <gnarf> that machine is doing builds
[10:24:49] <gnarf> with like phantomjs
[10:24:51] <gnarf> and stuff like that
[10:25:08] <gnarf> Krinkle: we should lower the build queue on swarm back down to a single job only
[10:25:14] <gnarf> just in case it might be the problem
[10:25:26] <gnarf> two builds causing a ram issue, causing php-fpm to die or something
[10:32:05] <Krinkle> gnarf: isn't it on 1 already?
[10:32:13] <Krinkle> why would it not be 1? we only have 1 browserstack account
[10:32:32] <Krinkle> gnarf: btw, are these real machines or vms?
[10:32:56] <Krinkle> can we create vms ourselves, or are they on a higher level / customer level?
[10:38:44] <gnarf> Krinkle: we have to ask support to do anything with these machines
[10:38:54] <Krinkle> k
[10:38:57] <gnarf> but basically whatever i ask for i get 
[10:39:05] <gnarf> or at least they haven't said "no" to a request yet
[10:39:26] <Krinkle> do we have a quota? was it donated?
[10:39:32] <gnarf> its all dontated
[10:39:35] <Krinkle> ok
[10:39:42] <Krinkle> so the quota is whatever they are willing to donate
[10:39:43] <Krinkle> cool
[10:39:49] <gnarf> i'm really looking forward to the helix tho
[10:39:55] <gnarf> because then i can just spawn servers for shit
[10:40:10] <Krinkle> yeah, you demo'd that in DC iirc
[10:40:12] <Krinkle> openstack, right?
[10:40:14] <gnarf> yeah
[10:40:19] <Krinkle> (it looked similar to what we have internally at Wikimedia)
[10:40:23] <Krinkle> (which I know is openstack)
[10:40:31] <gnarf> and (mt) apparently has adapters for jenkins + openstack api
[10:40:44] <gnarf> so we could actually spawn builds on single-use VMs
[10:40:50] <Krinkle> Right
[10:41:18] <Krinkle> that would make it more feasible to start doing PR testing en mass
[10:41:26] <Krinkle> blindly, that is
[10:43:15] <Krinkle> gnarf: though depending on how things go and how long they take, we might have phased out jenkins/testswarm by then (if we're doing that, that is)
[10:43:22] <Krinkle> in favour or just travis-co
[10:43:24] <Krinkle> ci*
[10:43:32] <Krinkle> there's a few things blocking us, but they are getting better.
[10:46:07] <Krinkle> gnarf: Ah, I better understand what you meant there, now that I read the reply on infra/issues
[10:46:12] <gnarf> yeah
[10:46:18] <Krinkle> gnarf: Aside from jenkins/testswarm themselves (testswarm itself is very light)
[10:46:30] <Krinkle> it is unclear whether jenkins or its builds are the issue
[10:46:39] <gnarf> or even some other client on the same (ve)
[10:46:47] <gnarf> abusing its disk 
[10:46:50] <Krinkle> yeah, there's other stuff happening on jq03 as well
[10:46:52] <gnarf> and leaking into ours
[10:47:15] <Krinkle> (ve) ?
[10:47:25] <Krinkle> is that a vm host?
[10:47:54] <gnarf> yeah
[10:48:01] <gnarf> just mt's name for their cluster
[10:48:05] <Krinkle> ok
[10:48:37] <Krinkle> so jq03 is a mt.ve.dv?

[19:53:35] <Ancient> Can anyone comment if there's a particular reason why delegate, undelegate, bind & unbind are in event rather than event-alias?
[22:26:07] <gnarf> Ancient: an argument could be made those should be event-alias, perhaps you should open an issue on https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com
