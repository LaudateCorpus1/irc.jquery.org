[06:42:02] <DaveMethvin> okay, i think we are ready to ship the betas for 1.11.1 and 2.1.1, just one small problem
[06:42:09] <DaveMethvin> I can't do it!
[06:43:57] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: would you be able to do the jquery-release for the betas later today?
[06:45:18] <DaveMethvin> geez, nota lot of people online today
[09:22:01] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I think that you got far enough in the release script to prove that the PR works.
[09:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> Can we land it?
[09:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> Grunt obviously ran.
[09:22:41] <DaveMethvin> migtht as well since it won't affect any mac users who run this
[09:22:45] <DaveMethvin> which will be all of them
[09:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I'll land the PR on jquery-release.
[09:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> Doing so will require the core PR to be merged.
[09:23:58] <DaveMethvin> i haven't found a volunteer to do the release yet
[09:24:03] <DaveMethvin> everyone seems to be gone today
[09:24:30] <scott_gonzalez> Well, whoever does it will get the extra joy of being the *real* tester ;-)
[09:24:46] <DaveMethvin> pioneers have to be used to arrows
[09:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> I just really want to land this because it affects pretty much everything inside jquery-release and we're trying to iterate on that pretty quickly.
[09:25:31] <DaveMethvin> do it! I'll land this pr in core
[09:30:04] <DaveMethvin> alphabetizing the deps list seems like such a fine thing to do until you have to merge shit
[09:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, it's merged into jquery-release.

[09:35:25] <DaveMethvin> dunzo
[09:36:58] <scott_gonzalez> I just got 0.00011867 …É for that commit :-P
[09:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder how tip4commit decides which commits deserve tips.
[09:37:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah i got one of those a couple of weeks ago
[09:37:44] <DaveMethvin> i figured it was more of a promo for their service
[09:37:56] <scott_gonzalez> I got 0.00004395 …É for a docs fix in node a few months ago.
[09:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have an account though, so the money just goes back after a month.
[09:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> I thought that was their service.
[09:38:40] <DaveMethvin> kind of like having all your btc in mtgox i guess :)
[09:39:28] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know what that is. I'm oblivious to these digital currency things.
[09:39:51] <scott_gonzalez> I did hear that you can mine for bitcoins in the browser though.
[09:39:51] <DaveMethvin> pay me in beer or money
[09:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> We could sneak that in to our CDN versions and give all the money to the foundation :-)
[09:40:27] <DaveMethvin> just in the jquery-latest version, those guys deserve it
[09:40:34] <arschmitz> ha ha
[09:40:47] <DaveMethvin> looks like we're getting some interest in the jquery.github.io site
[09:43:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'll be nice if we can get a project fully done by the community.
[09:43:24] <DaveMethvin> s/the community/not me/
[09:46:23] <snover> js library used on some absurd amount of sites and questions whether or not the community can actually get something done
[09:46:25] <snover> oss is depressing
[09:47:53] <DaveMethvin> scott did a talk where he looked at the team size vs the number of people using it, it is pretty amazing
[09:48:19] <DaveMethvin> our total list of CLA signatories is only about 1300 and most of them only did one or two commits
[09:51:10] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Not whether they can get it done, but whether they would do it.
[09:51:25] <scott_gonzalez> I have no doubt there are countless people who can build the simple site we want.
[09:51:44] <snover> well that is what i mean
[09:51:59] <snover> ‚Äúyeah i would love to do that! sign me up!‚Äù ‚Ä¶months pass‚Ä¶ ‚Äúoh yeah sorry i just haven‚Äôt really had time to do it yet but i swear i will soon‚Äù

[10:51:02] <kswedberg> git br
[10:51:11] <kswedberg> sorry.
[10:54:58] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: What do you think about i-love-oldie for the npm tag on 1.x releases? :-)
[10:55:13] <scott_gonzalez> npm install jquery@i-love-oldie
[10:55:31] <scott_gonzalez> We can actually use "1.x" for the tag.
[10:55:36] <jzaefferer> kswedberg: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrjwaqZfjIY
[10:55:39] <scott_gonzalez> It's a bit weird since it's a valid version range.
[10:55:51] <scott_gonzalez> And it'll never really get used because npm checks for version ranges first.
[10:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> But we have to have *some* tag applied to every version, which is a little annoying.
[10:56:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'll let the core team bikeshed about that.
[10:56:56] <kswedberg> jzaefferer: hahalarious. :)
