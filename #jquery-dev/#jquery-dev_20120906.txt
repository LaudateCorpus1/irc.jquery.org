[07:13:37] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: did qunit used to apply a shiv/shim for oldIE?
[07:13:38] <bot-t> (11 hours 40 mins ago) <kborchers> tell DaveMethvin you should have stuck around for the "Yippie, build fixed!" :)
[07:13:55] <DaveMethvin> haha
[07:14:18] <DaveMethvin> me and swarmy are good pals now
[07:14:34] <kborchers> :D
[07:14:38] <DaveMethvin> i'm going out drinkin with him tonight
[07:15:41] <kborchers> nice … i'm assuming he drinks Cosmos
[07:15:55] <DaveMethvin> even better,  he doesn't drink so i get 2
[07:15:59] <kborchers> LOL
[07:17:15] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: oldIE shiv? For what?
[07:17:32] <jzaefferer> at least none to murder oldIE in its sleep...
[07:17:52] <DaveMethvin> our tests had a shiv that was missing datalist
[07:18:07] <DaveMethvin> but it worked before we upgraded to 1.10
[07:18:16] <DaveMethvin> so i figured it musta had one somewhere
[07:18:53] <jzaefferer> you're referring to the createElement stuff, right?
[07:19:52] <DaveMethvin> right jzaefferer
[07:20:50] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/compare/v1.9.0...v1.10.0
[07:21:24] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/compare/v1.9.0...v1.10.0#L10R0
[07:22:17] <jzaefferer> so the reset changed, but you took care of that already
[07:22:25] <jzaefferer> the module filter select is new
[07:22:32] <jzaefferer> and it scrolls to top at then end
[07:22:48] <jzaefferer> that's pretty much it
[07:23:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:23:41] <DaveMethvin> it must be something about the difference in the fixture reset, since we duck-punch that
[07:24:08] <DaveMethvin> i mean, it works now and i saw that we needed to shiv datalist, but i can't figure out why it worked before :D
[10:09:04] <Eviltwin> Hey, I think there's a missing hasOwnProperty shield in cleanData
[10:09:06] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/unmNH/
[10:09:54] <Eviltwin> The weirdest thing is that if the function doesn't take any arguments, everything is fine
[10:10:31] <Eviltwin> (Repro'd in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox)
[10:11:19] <gnarf> Eviltwin: we don't support modififcations to Object.prototype http://docs.jquery.com/Won%27t_Fix
[10:11:27] <Eviltwin> Ah, okay
[10:11:57] <Eviltwin> I should probably have read that
[10:12:32] <ryanneufeld> but you have now
[10:12:33] <ryanneufeld> :)
[10:13:14] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I noticed you did some commit
[10:13:42] <ryanneufeld> Where do I add my username/password in the repo?
[10:41:34] <mikesherov> .
[11:03:26] <scott_gonzalez> I remember a repo collaborator list on GitHub, but I can't seem to find it. Anyone know what I'm talking about?
[11:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> Not the committers graph.
[11:15:28] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? How is this useful? http://developer.github.com/v3/git/commits/#create-a-commit
[11:31:39] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: teams?
[11:32:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: or maybe http://developer.github.com/v3/repos/collaborators/
[11:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I assume that API is for the page I'm thinking of, but I can't find the page.
[11:34:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-ui/collaborators
[11:35:34] <scott_gonzalez> Not quite what I was thinking of.
[11:35:53] <scott_gonzalez> There used to be a page that showed all authors ordered by commit count.
[11:39:42] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/graphs/contributors
[11:39:43] <gnarf> ?
[11:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: There used to be a page that was just a list, no graphs.
[11:55:10] <scott_gonzalez> They may have replaced it with the graphs though.
[11:55:12] <gnarf> probably before they redid the "graphs" page
[11:55:29] <scott_gonzalez> I was actually trying to find the data from that contributors graph page in the API.
[11:58:40] <DaveMethvin> most of that does not look useful as presented
[11:59:09] <DaveMethvin> i'd rather have some way to see what scott_gonzalez is talking about, total commits for a time period
[11:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yeah, I wanted to graph commits across all of our repos.
[12:00:02] <scott_gonzalez> Or subsets, like code repos, site repos, etc.
[12:00:08] <DaveMethvin> data visualizationis hard, let's go shopping
[12:00:17] <DaveMethvin> these just don't do much for me
[12:00:58] <DaveMethvin> i might be interested to know files or regions of files most modified
[12:03:58] <DaveMethvin> we need to do more commits at 4am according to this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/graphs/punch-card
[12:04:36] <ajpiano> wow, take MORE time off on sundays at 5am, will ya DaveMethvin
[12:04:44] <ajpiano> slacker
[12:05:22] <DaveMethvin> and again i am not sure how that graph improves anything, it just seems like eye-candy trivia
[12:06:18] <ajpiano> i donno DaveMethvin i feel like that really puts things in black and white, don't you
[12:06:23] <ajpiano> :D
[12:08:48] <Eviltwin> :D
[12:37:14] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: howd the botio test go?
[12:38:14] <DaveMethvin> just a sec gnarf
[12:58:12] <miketaylr> quick guys, time to strike is now: http://twitter.com/yaypie/status/243800061199413249
[13:35:17] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: the botio test went well except for a random failure in ajax for Chrome ... but it served its purpose anyway
[13:35:39] <DaveMethvin> the messages could use normal text i think
[15:05:05] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/timmywil/sizzle/commit/0142261e42aaa87cf7ddd0bb3064ee7a3e7120a3  So excited. Now I need to present the results.
[15:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues?milestone=1
[15:47:47] <scott_gonzalez> I spent the day working on the plugins site. This is the only issue left before we can do a soft launch.
[15:48:33] <scott_gonzalez> We *should* write user docs, but we can launch with what we've got.
[17:39:25] <jqcommit> [api.qunitjs.com] scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/kT6EHw
[17:39:25] <jqcommit> [api.qunitjs.com/master] Update XSL to match UI. - Scott González
[18:18:48] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: i just want to say that the uglify donation was an incredibly good idea
[18:20:01] <DaveMethvin> i think snover got Dojo to donate because he wanted us to pony up another $500 when it hits goal :D
[18:23:52] <snover> my goal is to make you go broke
[18:24:23] <snover> the only thing that bugs me about it is how insistent mishoo is on using his parser instead of esprima
[18:24:29] <snover> oh well
[18:26:56] <Eviltwin> Can't you just let the man be proud of his parser?
[18:28:17] <snover> I haven’t looked at the new one, I tried actually using the old one on another project before and quickly abandoned it
[18:29:01] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: well jzaefferer actually should get credit for the original idea :)
[18:29:17] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: but yeah, i was saying to snover
[18:29:22] <DaveMethvin> okay jzaefferer +1
[18:29:23] <ajpiano> this is library wars we can believe in
[18:29:47] <snover> yes
[18:29:48] <snover> oh
[18:29:48] <snover> uh
[18:29:51] <snover> YOU GUYS
[18:29:53] <snover> ARE TERRIBLE
[18:29:58] <snover> BLAH BLAH JQUERY SMELLY
[18:30:05] <DaveMethvin> ya ha poopie head
[18:31:02] <DaveMethvin> we got a lot of retweets, i'm hoping it will lead to donations
[18:31:31] <ajpiano> 14 people besides dojo and df donated
[18:32:29] <ajpiano> notbad.jpg
[18:42:33] <snover> ajpiano: up next, that package management thing
[18:45:25] <ajpiano> now now snover you know i've been encouraging you to wear pants for some time
[18:46:33] <snover> but they’re so constricting
[18:46:38] <snover> bbl
