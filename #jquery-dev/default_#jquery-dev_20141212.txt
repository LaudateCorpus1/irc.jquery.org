[06:02:35] <m_gol> gibon042: thanks!
[06:02:46] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[06:03:44] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[06:03:57] <m_gol> I've set up Jenkins jobs for 2.1-stable & 1.11-stable
[06:04:10] <m_gol> they'll show up in jQuery TestSwarm project, that would be hard to change
[06:04:28] <DaveMethvin> oh nice, that will save us the hassle of running by hand at least
[06:04:49] <m_gol> I'll add a separate browserSet for IE6-7 so that we have those run automatically for 1.11-stable as well
[06:05:06] <m_gol> thx to jzaefferer for reminding me about that :)
[06:05:09] <DaveMethvin> ok, great
[06:05:19] <DaveMethvin> let's hope we didn't break anything there !
[06:06:48] <m_gol> :)
[06:16:29] <m_gol> gibson042: just to be sure: I assume there are no breaking changes between Sizzle 1.10.19 and 2.1.0?
[06:16:52] <m_gol> `tell gibson042 just to be sure: I assume there are no breaking changes between Sizzle 1.10.19 and 2.1.0?
[06:16:52] <b-ot> m_gol: Iâ€™ll tell gibson042 about that.
[06:18:34] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: seems we didn't break anything: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3982 ;)
[06:18:57] <DaveMethvin> HOW DID WE MANAGE THAT :)
[06:19:21] <m_gol> just one Safari red
[06:19:41] <m_gol> when do you want to update Sizzle?
[06:20:18] <DaveMethvin> now would be great on both master and the -stables, might as well
[06:20:42] <DaveMethvin> we'd stop getting that darned "STILL UNSTABLE"
[06:20:47] <m_gol> yeah
[06:21:11] <m_gol> I need to run now; at least Jenkins is on so we'll see if Sizzle update broke sth
[06:21:24] <DaveMethvin> yep, thanks a lot!
[06:21:29] <m_gol> np
[06:39:40] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: back for a moment: I've added Chrome & Fx that we tested when 2.1.1 came out as well as Opera 12.1x and Safari 5.1 so that we don't break them as well (older Fx needs prefixed box-sizing for example)
[06:39:43] <m_gol> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/3983
[06:39:50] <m_gol> it'll be a little wider than usual :P
[06:40:19] <DaveMethvin> ok sounds good ... the wider table is np
[12:51:59] <robertmaxrees> I'm currently looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1774 - I tested with 1.11.0 and saw the bug, but then it went away in 1.11.1, and stayed "gone" in current master.  We wouldn't want to fix an "old" version, right?
[12:52:51] <DaveMethvin> robertmaxrees: right ... do you have a test case working then? Post it and I'll close the ticket
[12:53:40] <robertmaxrees> not up live anywhere, no.  just testing locally.  I can get one together, though.
[12:53:46] <robertmaxrees> might not be for a little while.
[12:54:06] <DaveMethvin> no problem, the ticket will be there for  you :) thanks!
[12:54:12] <robertmaxrees> thank you!
[13:04:32] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin closed issue #1774: Show animations, like $.show() $.toggle() and $.slideDown(), don't respect css display property if initial state is display:none; 02http://git.io/Y3D22Q
[17:14:29] <Krinkle> $('a<br/><br/>') -> invalid selector, makes sense since we now require '<' at the start to avoid location.hash-like xss vectors.
[17:14:43] <Krinkle> $('<br/>a<br/>') -> 3 nodes (br, text, br)
[17:14:50] <Krinkle> $('<br/><br/>a') -> 2 nodes (br, br)
[17:14:51] <Krinkle> ?
[17:14:53] <Krinkle> Is that a bug?
[17:19:55] <Krinkle> $('<div>').append('a<br/><br/>') -> 3 nodes (text , br, br)
[17:20:00] <Krinkle> inconistent? Mmm.
[17:20:34] <Krinkle> Ah, right. append() never takes a selector. That's appendTo
