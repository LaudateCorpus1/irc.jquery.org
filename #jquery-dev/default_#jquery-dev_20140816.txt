[18:37:14] <gnarf> RFC from the AMD / require crew: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/pull/73
[18:37:48] <gnarf> cc scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin|away arschmitz - do we have a standard wrapper I should wrap color in?
[19:01:35] <arschmitz> gnarf: for ui ( and in the future for mobile ) we use https://github.com/umdjs/umd/blob/master/jqueryPlugin.js similar to the one kswedberg suggested in the ticket. 
[19:02:11] <arschmitz> gnarf: thats the one we had settled on when he had the big amd / umd meeting last year
