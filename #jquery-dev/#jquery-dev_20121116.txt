[06:34:58] <ikesherov> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/820
[06:34:59] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-ui by jpka (2d, 13h ago): Slider: when handles overlap, clicking and dragging will now pick the last...
[06:35:12] <ikesherov> so that pull needs the Qunit.reset() for event synchronization
[06:40:26] <timmywil> who updates the download page? 1.8.2 is so yesterday
[06:41:01] <timmywil> DaveMethvin
[06:41:16] <timmywil> gnarf maybe?
[06:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin is supposed to do it as part of the release process.
[07:12:37] <elijahmanor> John Hann noticed that the version of jQuery on jquery.com is 1.8.2
[07:12:44] <elijahmanor> Just thought I'd mention that if you didn't know already
[07:20:30] <timmywil> elijahmanor: yea sounds like a bug in the release script
[07:20:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin hasn't shown up yet today
[07:21:55] <elijahmanor> timmywil: ahh, no problem. just thought i'd mention it
[07:24:00] <timmywil> maybe danheberden or gnarf could update it? or we'll take care of it as soon as dave is available to pong
[07:27:48] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: okay, what exactly should I do other than edit the repo and commit? I thought it rebuilt automagically
[07:29:25] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/commit/23d62bf35794843cf8d6a39643c7c0bfbed134d3

[09:07:02] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ping
[09:07:13] <DaveMethvin> sup rwaldron
[09:07:29] <rwaldron> Do you have a moment to do me a favor?
[09:07:34] <rwaldron> If yes, just build jQuery
[09:07:44] <rwaldron> then open build/jquery.js and min
[09:07:51] <DaveMethvin> ok
[09:07:51] <rwaldron> and tell me what the version is
[09:08:14] <DaveMethvin> probably 1.8.3pre
[09:08:19] <rwaldron> same here
[09:08:25] <DaveMethvin> it just needs to be updated
[09:08:28] <rwaldron> ok
[09:08:32] <rwaldron> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.js
[09:08:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:08:41] <rwaldron> one more thing
[09:08:57] <rwaldron> actually, one se
[09:08:58] <rwaldron> sec*
[09:09:32] <rwaldron> just needed to confirm something
[09:09:36] <rwaldron> notice something missing?
[09:09:46] <DaveMethvin> um
[09:09:50] <rwaldron> Also missing here
[09:09:50] <rwaldron> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.min.js
[09:10:08] <rwaldron> but is present in my local build and probably yours as well
[09:10:12] <rwaldron> "use strict"
[09:10:43] <DaveMethvin> i don't know if we did that in 1.8-stable
[09:10:46] <DaveMethvin> i doubt we did
[09:11:13] <DaveMethvin> 1.8.3 wasn't built from master
[09:11:18] <DaveMethvin> it came out of a branch
[09:11:33] <DaveMethvin> otherwise we'd have gotten a bunch of breaking changes
[09:11:52] <rwaldron> right
[09:12:01] <rwaldron> but this was added several weeks ago
[09:12:15] <rwaldron> ...wasn't it?
[09:12:26] <DaveMethvin> yes but 1.8-stable was branched from before the summit
[09:12:38] <DaveMethvin> and we cherry picked a few fixes from after that
[09:12:41] <rwaldron> ohhhh right I completely forgot that
[09:12:43] <rwaldron> ha
[09:12:47] <DaveMethvin> :)
[09:12:55] <rwaldron> great
[09:12:57] <rwaldron> awesome
[09:13:06] <DaveMethvin> i'll update the version to 1.9pre tho
[09:13:12] <rwaldron> cool
[09:17:57] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/7xwpzg
[09:17:57] <jqcommit> jquery/master 28df086 Dave Methvin: Updating the version to 1.9.0pre.
[09:24:22] <elijahmanor> DaveMethvin: backgroundPositionX & backgroundPositionY are weird buggers because they don't show up in window.getComputedStyle (at least not in IE10 where I'm checking it) so even though I can set it with elem.css("backgroundPositionX", "5%") I can't get it back out elem.css("backgroundPositionX") => undefined
[09:25:21] <elijahmanor> let me check if getPropertyValue gives me anything different
[09:30:44] <Krinkle> jquery 1.8.1-2-3 is missing from http://code.jquery.com/ index
[09:32:21] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: agreed, i can't get into the server anymore to edit the page
[09:32:57] <Krinkle> can't get into the server, or not to edit the page?
[09:33:15] <DaveMethvin> i have no access to make the change
[09:33:21] <DaveMethvin> afaik
[09:33:24] <Krinkle> k
[09:33:32] <Krinkle> I'll add it later
[09:33:42] <DaveMethvin> i had it on my todo list to figure out
[09:33:49] <Krinkle> though, ping gnarf, any ideas/progress on getting git-deployish ?
[09:34:08] <Krinkle> we were going to maintain the file on github instead, and/or in some automated version
[09:34:10] <Krinkle> fashion*
[09:34:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's a simple site
[09:34:39] <DaveMethvin> although, deploy doesn't seem to be working for jquery.com either
[09:34:46] <DaveMethvin> i just tried pushing today, 3 times
[09:34:52] <DaveMethvin> still stuck at 1.8.2

[09:41:48] <Krinkle> okay so the debug line is gone, but it still won't connect to the databse
[09:43:52] <Krinkle> I didn't even touch db stuff
[09:43:54] <Krinkle> wtf?
[09:48:27] <Krinkle> It can't read localSettings.json

[12:54:16] <gibson042> DaveMethvin timmywil et al: are you actively working on anything right now? I'd like to drop in a smaller Sizzle and confirm that it passes TestSwarm
[12:54:39] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: you had me at "smaller"
[12:54:51] <timmywil> yea, I'm working on something currently
[12:55:12] <gibson042> timmywil: should I hold or go ahead?
[12:55:25] <timmywil> gibson042: go ahead
[12:55:28] <DaveMethvin> i am working on a pull but a   new sizzle won't affect it, so whatever works for you and timmywil
[12:56:32] <timmywil> oh you meant for jQuery. no I'm just busy

[13:21:04] <gibson042> woohoo :D
[14:53:21] <ajpiano> gnarf: you might also want to check in with DaveMethvin, he is having a whale of a time with getting 1.8.3 onto jquery.com
[14:54:14] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ?
[14:55:02] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i've updated the repo but it doesn't seem to be pushing to the site
[14:55:05] <DaveMethvin> tagged a few times
[14:55:35] <gnarf> jquery.com?
[14:55:40] <DaveMethvin> yep
[14:56:18] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com
[14:56:43] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: grunt is failing lint
[14:56:47] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/d994b5c49c30a0d12e2a
[14:57:18] <DaveMethvin> ok..but i didn't change that
[14:57:30] <DaveMethvin> i just s/2/3/g "D
[14:57:32] <DaveMethvin> "D
[14:57:35] <DaveMethvin> :D
[14:58:04] <gnarf> yeah, the newer versions of grunt are more picky
[14:58:13] <DaveMethvin> as are newer versions of lint i've noticed
[14:58:25] <gnarf> we should start asking for a specific grunt version so this stops happening
[14:58:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[14:58:58] <DaveMethvin> if there's a way to expose the build errors that would be good too
[14:59:06] <DaveMethvin> i just couldn't see what was happening
[14:59:14] <gnarf> yes
[14:59:30] <gnarf> its pretty high on my list to find some way to email/irc announce the deploy results
[14:59:52] <DaveMethvin> that would be peachy!
[15:00:18] <DaveMethvin> my wife is telling me i have to leave
[15:00:28] <gnarf> i got the fix getting pushed now
