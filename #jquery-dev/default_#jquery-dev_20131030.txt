[09:26:52] <steu> hi guys
[09:27:43] <steu> i was trying 2.1.0-beta1. it fails to initialize because at row 3974 it uses a bad XML formatted HTML.
[09:27:55] <steu> div.innerHTML = "<input type='radio' checked name='t'/>"
[09:27:59] <steu> should be
[09:28:06] <steu> div.innerHTML = "<input type='radio' checked='checked' name='t'/>"
[09:28:23] <steu> this makes it work with XHTML strict
[09:28:37] <m_gol> steu: would you like to submit a PR and get to AUTHORS.txt? ;)
[09:29:16] <m_gol> create a ticket on bugs.jquery.com first, please
[09:32:16] <steu> done, ticket #14496
[09:32:57] <m_gol> steu: do you want to submit a pull request?
[09:34:04] <steu> would be nice.
[09:40:18] <steunix> how can a PR be submitted?
[09:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Can you weigh in on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1029 about handling CSS dependencies?
[09:40:36] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #1029 by rxaviers (3mon 2w ago): AMD support
[09:41:17] <steunix> oh, ok, with github
[09:41:35] <snover> scott_gonzalez: this is kind of a long thing, is there something specific i should ook at?
[09:42:11] <scott_gonzalez> The actual discussion starts about half way down https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1029#issuecomment-26918767
[09:42:11] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #1029 by rxaviers (3mon 2w ago): AMD support
[09:42:21] <scott_gonzalez> We're wondering how we should handle CSS dependencies for widgets.
[09:42:38] <scott_gonzalez> Whether we should put them in the define() and require an AMD implementation that supports CSS loading.
[09:42:40] <snover> do what dgrid does
[09:42:49] <scott_gonzalez> Or we should use comments.
[09:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> Can you explain what dgrid does in that PR?
[09:43:23] <snover> yuip
[09:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:47:03] <steunix> m_gol, but where should I look for the incriminated row in the source?
[09:50:26] <steunix> m_gol:btw, it seems it is already fixed
[09:52:44] <snover> scott_gonzalez: replied
[09:52:57] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[09:57:03] <m_gol> steunix: possible ;) always check in http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git2.js for jQuery 2.x & http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git1.js for jQuery 1.x
[09:58:08] <steunix> yes, i've found the row in src/manipulation/support.js
[09:58:38] <steunix> it's fine now
[10:37:07] <valtido> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm
[10:37:21] <valtido> I am stuck on number 8, no idea what that means any help ?
[11:31:47] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Can you grant me access to screenshots on browserstack?
[11:32:00] <Krinkle> https://www.browserstack.com/accounts/manage-users
[11:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: I can ask them to upgrade our account, but we don't have a screenshoot plan.
[11:32:52] <Krinkle> isn't that included>?
[11:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[11:33:05] <Krinkle> oh, ok. np.
[11:33:16] <scott_gonzalez> https://www.browserstack.com/accounts/subscriptions
[11:33:19] <Krinkle> it used to be available on my account, I thought it was just a change in default for corp accounts
[11:33:45] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they changed their pricing recently.
[11:35:31] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Ah, it is included
[11:35:33] <Krinkle> but 1 user only
[11:35:37] <Krinkle> you in this case :)
[11:35:43] <Krinkle> Live
[11:35:44] <Krinkle> Corporate 35 users
[11:35:44] <Krinkle> Automate
[11:35:45] <Krinkle> Turbo 30 parallel runs
[11:35:47] <Krinkle> Screenshots
[11:35:49] <Krinkle> Lite 1 user
[11:36:00] <Krinkle> np
[11:37:17] <Krinkle> oddly, when I log out it works fine.
[11:37:24] <Krinkle> Seems like a bug
[11:37:31] <Krinkle> they have limited options for free users
[11:37:45] <Krinkle> when logged in the advanced options appear, but it also becomes restricted to having that plan.
[11:40:54] <scott_gonzalez> odd
