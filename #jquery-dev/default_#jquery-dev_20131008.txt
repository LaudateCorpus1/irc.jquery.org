[05:04:31] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin|away miketaylr gnarf: Do we support `body { overflow: hidden; }` ?
[05:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9588
[05:05:32] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like this has come up before and someone said it wasn't supported.
[05:05:48] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm not positive about that, and it could have changed.
[09:46:59] <rwaldron> m_gol I just responded to your Q about classList
[09:48:06] <rwaldron> in Chrome: document.body.classList.add("foo", "bar", "baz"); document.body.classList.length === 3; document.body.className; // "foo bar baz"
[09:48:50] <rwaldron> you could feature detect this by creating an element, add 2 classes to it and check that the length is 2
[09:49:25] <rwaldron> in which case, jQuery.fn.addClass(str) => elem.classList.add(str.split(space));
[09:51:47] <m_gol> hmm, I don't understand your comment
[09:52:06] <m_gol> rwaldron: why elem.classList.add("foo", "bar", "baz"); would be treated as  elem.classList.add("foo");?
[09:53:06] <rwaldron> because it was updated to behave as though it was implemented with rest parameters
[09:53:24] <rwaldron> function f(…rest) { return rest.length; } 
[09:53:58] <m_gol> yes, I know about rest parameters, it just seems that with them in the implementation elem.classList.add("foo", "bar", "baz") should actually work
[09:54:04] <m_gol> what am I missing?
[09:54:15] <rwaldron> foo(1,2,3,4,5,6,7); // 7
[09:54:19] <rwaldron> try this in Firefox
[09:54:54] <rwaldron> noooo i dont mean that elem.classList.add("foo", "bar", "baz"); would be treated _as_ elem.classList.add("foo",); 
[09:54:57] <rwaldron> -,
[09:55:15] <snover> hi rwaldron ::
[09:55:17] <rwaldron> I meant that it would be handled the same way, as an array
[09:55:18] <snover> :)*
[09:55:23] <m_gol> ah, ok ;)
[09:55:30] <rwaldron> the latter being an array of one string
[09:55:31] <snover> i like your tweets about moz
[09:55:32] <rwaldron> sorry
[09:55:33] <m_gol> sure
[09:55:38] <m_gol> now I understand, hehe
[09:55:52] <rwaldron> snover getVibrator is a google jam
[09:56:23] <snover> is that the version 2 api for getDildo?
[09:56:45] <rwaldron> snover probably
[09:57:05] <rwaldron> snover I caught you talking shit, but couldn't confront you about it
[09:57:10] <rwaldron> but now it's too late
[09:57:18] <rwaldron> y u no love -ot?
[09:57:19] <b-ot> rwaldron: (屮'Д')屮
