[03:53:07] <Guest11702> blahblah
[08:00:53] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle|detached: Meeting time?  /cc: scott_gonzalez gnarf
[08:02:00] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: I pinged jzaefferer 10 minutes ago, but haven't heard back yet.
[08:02:09] <scott_gonzalez> I can open #jquery-meeting if you have stuff to go over.
[08:10:43] <JamesMGreene> I don't
[08:11:04] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: I don't. Been swamped with crazy life, family medical things, etc. :-\
[08:11:11] <JamesMGreene> slackin'
[08:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer just responded saying no meeting.
[08:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> So don't feel bad :-P
[08:12:21] <scott_gonzalez> Hope everything goes well with your family.
[08:40:42] <ralphholzmann> hey DaveMethvin
[08:41:01] <ralphholzmann> have any Dropbox referrals shown up yet?
[08:42:09] <DaveMethvin> ralphholzmann I don't  *think* so ... where would I see them?
[08:53:43] <ralphholzmann> you'd get an email to whatever address is on file with Dropbox
[09:02:22] <JamesMGreene> Thanks, scott_gonzalez
[09:02:29] <JamesMGreene> later, ladies and gents
[12:19:09] <nacin> You guys might enjoy - WordPress core just started using QUnit.
[12:22:59] <DaveMethvin> ralphholzmann definitely haven't gotten anything from dropbox, and no notices when i log in
[12:23:26] <DaveMethvin> nacin nice to hear!
[12:23:29] <snover> unsend to dropbox
[12:23:40] <snover> why would you â€¦sigh
[12:23:51] <miketaylr> why would i sigh?
[12:23:59] <miketaylr> let me count the ways
[12:24:48] <DaveMethvin> snover miketaylr the annoying thing is that 2.9GB of my 3GB quota is in a folder SHARED wiht me
[12:25:10] <miketaylr> DaveMethvin: time to unshare that shiz
[12:25:11] <DaveMethvin> supposedly they do that to prevent people chaining free accounts
[12:25:20] <DaveMethvin> what if I NEED it?
[12:25:27] <miketaylr> but what if you DONT!
[12:25:29] <snover> iâ€™d tell you to use spideroak, butâ€¦donâ€™t use spideroak
[12:25:38] <snover> i want to like it but it is awful
[12:25:49] <miketaylr> somehow i've accumulated 61GB of free dropbox space
[12:25:52] <DaveMethvin> i have plenty of other cloud storage, just not dropbox
[12:25:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah i have 30gb on skydrive
[12:26:11] <miketaylr> probs 20GB from ralphholzmann's s2d hookup
[13:05:45] <Krinkle> nacin: Thanks, that's great to hear.
[13:06:13] <Krinkle> nacin: I heard you guys are also using CSSJanus (specifically the PHP port of Wikimedia incl. bugfixes etc.)
[13:11:41] <nacin> Krinkle: I think WordPress.com is using the PHP port. We've adopted Grunt for core; worked on our own Grunt plugin: https://github.com/yoavf/grunt-cssjanus
[13:14:56] <Krinkle> Nice
