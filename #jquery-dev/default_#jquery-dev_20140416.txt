[00:53:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin|away scott_gonzalez: can we get rid of the npm jquery user completely? Especially that it has a non-existing e-mail assigned and mails in the isaacs thread bounce off of it
[00:53:59] <m_gol> DaveMethvin|away scott_gonzalez: it's better if we just know who has access and don't give the same key to an unspecified number of people

[10:06:32] <DaveMethvin> m_gol scott_gonzalez agreed, we shouldn't be sharing auth if we don't have to
[14:11:38] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I just created two new reports for UI's Trac: open tickets with duplicates and all tickets with more than one duplicate.
[14:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> Useful for determining open tickets that need attention and finding an old ticket when you know a new ticket is a duplicate.
[14:12:50] <snover> scott_gonzalez: the answer to your dvd problem is to upload the video to youtube and then write the URL on the DVD with a permanent marker
[14:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Thanks. That'll be useful when my van gets an Internet connection.
[14:13:55] <snover> just tape a 4g ipad to it
[14:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> Sounds expensive.
[14:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> There's another flaw with that plan. The MPAA wouldn't let the youtube videos happen.
[20:18:03] <Krinkle> m_gol: jzaefferer: I thought i created the account already? I shared the credentials on the wiki and on the infra ticket. If you need another one, just let me know on an infra ticket. Should be simple enough to have done within a day.
[20:18:14] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: m_gol: Which account did you create? Did it work?
[20:18:33] <Krinkle> If so, please document on https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/TestSwarm#create-users

[20:18:54] <Krinkle> OK :)
