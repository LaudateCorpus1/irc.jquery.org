[09:04:32] <JamesMGreene> Has anyone worked with the CSS zoom property much?
[09:04:42] <JamesMGreene> (both in its oldIE and CSS3 implementations)
[09:06:31] <JamesMGreene> Trying to figure out if some of the weirdness I'm seeing is the expected standard behavior or maybe bugs
[09:06:45] <JamesMGreene> mikesherov timmywil?
[09:12:47] <timmywil> JamesMGreene: I haven't played with it much. I've only used it to magically fix stuff in IE sometimes.
[09:13:08] <timmywil> arschmitz: pong
[09:13:55] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ping
[09:14:03] <arschmitz> timmywil: hey having issues with jquery git build in the mobile tests thought it was the updated sizzle because of timing but digging deeper seems to be an events issue
[09:14:32] <timmywil> arschmitz: what's the issue?
[09:17:02] <arschmitz> timmywil: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/jquery.setNameSpace.js no longer works
[09:17:21] <arschmitz> that event no longer fires
[09:17:34] <arschmitz> works if i wrap in a document ready though
[09:18:06] <timmywil> arschmitz: where's the code to trigger it?
[09:18:57] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.init.js#L32
[09:19:42] <arschmitz> worked until yesterday
[09:19:50] <arschmitz> and works on all other jquery versions
[09:21:54] <timmywil> no error, right? just doesn't fire?
[09:22:03] <arschmitz> right
[09:22:07] <timmywil> checking
[09:23:07] <arschmitz> thanks i originally thought sizzle because its only real change i see in last day or so and its effecting a selector but that clearly does not seem to be the case

[09:57:19] <timmywil> arschmitz: so funny story, I forgot to include the AMD definition
[09:57:54] <timmywil> I ran jquery-mobile button tests against it and it seems to fix the fails
[09:58:06] <arschmitz> ok awesome
[09:59:28] <arschmitz> thanks for looking into that
[09:59:40] <timmywil> np, thanks for letting me know
[10:01:47] <timmywil> it might take a minute for jquery-git to update
[10:07:37] <timmywil> gnarf, Krinkle|detached : ping
[10:08:43] <timmywil> swarm is just timing out on everything. I'm not sure what the problem is, but I'd be willing to investigate if I log into jenkins.
[10:08:53] <timmywil> *could log*
[10:09:10] <timmywil> uh, into swarm

[10:12:01] <doesallmagic2> timmywillisn: When converting the source to AMD, don't forget to AMD
[10:16:05] <JamesMGreene> Oh, well that's just grand
[10:17:47] <JamesMGreene> With CSS `zoom` in IE10, it affects width as well as height even if the width isn't specified. Chrome does not. And, of course, Firefox doesn't even honor `zoom` at all yet.
[10:17:49] <JamesMGreene> argh
[10:18:13] <timmywil> JamesMGreene: why don't you use transform?
[10:18:50] <JamesMGreene> timmywil: Not my CSS
[10:19:02] <JamesMGreene> It's just negatively impacting users when they use my lib on a page with it
[10:19:11] <JamesMGreene> e.g. with Reveal.js (grr)
[10:19:48] <JamesMGreene> Maybe Hakim isn't aware of the transforms...?
[10:20:24] <JamesMGreene> CSS zoom is wicked frustrating since `getComputedStyle` gives non-inherited values
[10:20:49] <JamesMGreene> Oh hey, look at that, JSFiddle doesn't work in IE7/IE8 mode
[10:21:56] <JamesMGreene> Has that been the case for a while now?
[10:22:03] <JamesMGreene> I haven't tested any fiddles in IE7/8 lately
[10:22:17] <timmywil> I'm sure he's aware. Not sure why he's using zoom tho.
[10:24:55] <JamesMGreene> "// Prefer applying scale via zoom since Chrome blurs scaled content with nested transforms"
[10:25:53] <timmywil> interesting

[11:57:38] <timmywil> Oh, I actually talked to scott about that in IRC. Didn't know there was an open issue. Yes, I think it is still necessary.
[11:57:55] <arschmitz> ah ok he had not told me he talked to you about it 
[11:58:43] <arschmitz> he probably meant to and just got busy :)
