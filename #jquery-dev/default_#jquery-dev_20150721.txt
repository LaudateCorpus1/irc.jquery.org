[09:17:55] <rrrosenfeld> Hi there, I was discussing in #jquery about the toggleClass([state]) signature and we think there's some sort of bug going on, at least in the docs, which seem to be missing:
[09:17:57] <rrrosenfeld> https://jsfiddle.net/jdoedx2v/4/
[09:18:03] <rrrosenfeld> http://api.jquery.com/toggleclass/#toggleClass-state
[09:18:28] <rrrosenfeld> It's not clear from the docs what it does when a class is not provided...
[09:18:52] <rrrosenfeld> by experimenting, like in the jsfiddle above, you'll also note that it's a bit inconsistent with what some might expect...
[09:19:21] <rrrosenfeld> for example, it seems the classes are assumed to be those existing before the first call to toggleClass without providing a class...
[09:19:39] <rrrosenfeld> but if you pass true it behaves the same way when no parameter is passed to state...
[09:20:06] <rrrosenfeld> while one might expect it to always have all classes added back to the selector to be consistent with the other signatures...
[09:20:26] <rrrosenfeld> Otherwise, to get this behavior one would have to call toggleClass(false) and then toggleClass()
[09:20:30] <rrrosenfeld> Are we missing anything?
[09:41:11] <m_gol> rrosenfeld: yeah, ot seems not described very well... could you open an issue at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues?
[09:44:03] <rrrosenfeld> sure, thanks for confirming

[09:48:34] <arthurvr> Thank you rrrosenfeld :)
[09:48:53] <arthurvr> I fully agree that thereâ€™s much we can clarify
