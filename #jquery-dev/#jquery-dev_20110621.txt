[12:35:25] <timmywil> isn't /\s\s*/ the same as /\s+/ or is there some advantage to the former?
[12:36:31] <timmywil> i just keep seeing it, oh well
[12:36:57] <sean`> timmywil, same as /\s{1,}/
[12:37:44] <timmywil> heh, yea that too

[13:21:58] <timmywil> nice
[15:46:14] <gnarf> jaubourg: yt?
[15:46:36] <jaubourg> yes
[15:46:49] <jaubourg> sup gnarf?
[15:47:57] <gnarf> do you have / have seen an ajax hook for queued requests yet?
[15:48:50] <jaubourg> no but it's something to be done outside of ajax, using the promise properties
[15:49:03] <gnarf> yeah
[15:49:05] <jaubourg> I'm wondering if I didn't post some kind of queue thing on SO back in the days
[15:49:13] <gnarf> I have an old one
[15:49:17] <gnarf> but it doesn't pass back a deferred
[15:50:04] <jaubourg> problem with queued requests is that you need a function for each success so that you can pipe properly using what the previous ajax call gave
[15:50:34] <jaubourg> but it's definitely doable, let me cook something up on a fiddle
[15:51:02] <gnarf> jaubourg: I wanna do one ;)
[15:51:12] <jaubourg> hehe
[15:51:31] <jaubourg> let me take a stab at it and see where we two go... :)
[15:51:41] <gnarf> k, we will compare notes
[15:51:42] <gnarf> :)
[15:51:43] <jaubourg> confrontation of ideas ftw
[15:52:17] <gnarf> can you delay the actual send of the request in a jqXHR?
[15:55:36] <jaubourg> no, but you can do this: function( ajaxOptions, delay ) { return $.Deferred(function( defer ) { setTimeout( defer.resolve, delay ); }).pipe(function() { return $.ajax( ajaxOptions ); }); }
[15:58:07] <gnarf> jaubourg: but that wont pass the jqXHR methods/props down right?
[15:58:11] <gnarf> just the promise?
[15:58:23] <jaubourg> yep, just the promise
[15:58:49] <jaubourg> but you have the jqXHR in the callbacks arguments so heh
[16:01:59] <gnarf> hrm
[16:02:21] <gnarf> another random question - can you add extra methods to the things copied by .promise() ?
[16:06:08] <jaubourg> no but if you manually add things to what promise returns, it'll stay there since the promise object is unique to a deferred
[16:06:13] <jaubourg> you can
[16:06:33] <gnarf> even if you call .promise() on the promise?
[16:06:36] <gnarf> does it return this?
[16:06:53] <jaubourg> yes
[16:06:59] <gnarf> kickass
[16:07:28] <jaubourg> it has more to do with the promise method being the same, thus in the closure, thus returning the same cached object
[16:11:32] <jaubourg> god I hate jsfiddle ajax testing stuff... since it handles redirection I have a feeling it just fails silently using ajax... and the fact it's POST only, plz
[16:14:40] <jaubourg> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/XkUfq/3/
[16:14:48] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[16:15:22] <jaubourg> hey rick :)
[16:15:30] <rwaldron> hey jaubourg
[16:15:35] <jaubourg> sup?
[16:15:35] <rwaldron> how goes?
[16:15:38] <rwaldron> ugh
[16:15:54] <rwaldron> i had a to make an emergency dentist appointment
[16:16:01] <rwaldron> for today
[16:16:19] <jaubourg> tired of this "t is showing bug" thought we had that fixed in the support rewrite, but I guess we must have removed something since then
[16:16:22] <jaubourg> I hate this thing
[16:16:31] <jaubourg> ouch
[16:16:39] <jaubourg> not too painful?
[16:16:42] <rwaldron> so they took x-rays and the dude comes in says "these have to come out - see that (points to xray) its you nerve ending - this will only get worse"
[16:16:58] <rwaldron> two teeth gone
[16:17:05] <rwaldron> in a matter of minuts
[16:17:14] <jaubourg> :(
[16:17:22] <jaubourg> not front ones I hope
[16:17:29] <rwaldron> no thankfully
[16:17:33] <rwaldron> but still sucks
[16:17:37] * erichynds vomits
[16:17:41] <erichynds> did they put you under?
[16:17:45] <rwaldron> no
[16:17:53] <erichynds> that's the only way i could do it
[16:17:55] <rwaldron> and dig this...
[16:18:00] <rwaldron> no topical
[16:18:07] <erichynds> ...
[16:18:24] <jaubourg> :/
[16:18:25] <rwaldron> like, they usually put topical gel in mouth
[16:18:34] <rwaldron> before they stick you with needles
[16:18:44] <rwaldron> its like the warm up to the needles
[16:18:53] <rwaldron> he skipped that
[16:19:00] <rwaldron> surprisingly, no pain
[16:19:14] <rwaldron> deep breath, pinch then done
[16:19:39] <erichynds> you are a stronger man than i
[16:19:41] <rwaldron> the only shitty part was when one of the teeth broke as he was pulling it
[16:19:51] <rwaldron> i fucking HEARD the cracking noise
[16:19:58] <rwaldron> but obviously didnt feel it.
[16:20:20] <rwaldron> still, thats crazy shit to hear coming from inside your own mouth
[16:24:23] <rwaldron> wow
[16:24:32] <rwaldron> I used to play bass for this project... http://lindseystarr.bandcamp.com/
[16:24:41] <rwaldron> the dude on this recording is boring as shit.
[16:24:42] <timmywil> rwaldron: hey there
[16:24:55] <rwaldron> timmywil stop promoting bad practices
[16:24:55] <timmywil> sry about your teeth
[16:24:58] <rwaldron> that is all.
[16:25:11] <timmywil> ?
[16:25:14] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9328
[16:25:30] <rwaldron> (my teeth and the ghosts of my teeth appreciate it)
[16:25:46] <jaubourg> lol
[16:25:54] <jaubourg> gumprickwaldron
[16:26:03] <rwaldron> ?
[16:26:07] <rwaldron> gump?
[16:26:09] <jaubourg> grumpy sorry
[16:26:12] <timmywil> oh haha, hey man, the fact we have a value hook at all promotes bad practices, that commit is a little closer to good practices
[16:26:28] <rwaldron> i was only teasing
[16:26:42] <rwaldron> jaubourg its true, this guys is boring as fuck
[16:26:53] <rwaldron> but....
[16:26:53] <gnarf> jaubourg: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NqVgK/
[16:26:55] <timmywil> i know, i defend myself.  it's a reflex
[16:27:01] <rwaldron> i;m about to find out if i need to hire a lawyer
[16:27:09] <rwaldron> (i didnt part on good terms)
[16:27:21] <rwaldron> nor did my best friend, who was the drummer
[16:27:23] <timmywil> with your dentist?
[16:27:28] <rwaldron> noooo
[16:27:30] <timmywil> lol
[16:27:32] <rwaldron> http://lindseystarr.bandcamp.com/
[16:27:47] <rwaldron> i used to play base for her
[16:27:50] <rwaldron> bass*
[16:27:52] <rwaldron> ugh
[16:27:56] <rwaldron> my head is swampy
[16:28:36] <jaubourg> I find it a bit "boring" music-wise
[16:28:46] <timmywil> cool, don't know much about her but I've heard of her
[16:29:07] <jaubourg> gnarf: ah, using the promise to add the abort method I see
[16:29:13] <gnarf> jaubourg: :)
[16:29:19] <gnarf> i like yours too
[16:29:25] <gnarf> took a few reads to get it
[16:29:34] <rwaldron> jaubourg it is
[16:29:42] <rwaldron> but this guy is a boring bass player
[16:29:44] <rwaldron> http://lindseystarr.bandcamp.com/track/love-and-death-in-the-city-2
[16:29:58] <rwaldron> the chorus used to be a doo-wop sounding bassline
[16:30:05] <jaubourg> gnarf: yes it's a structure-less approach
[16:30:13] <rwaldron> it was a nice mix with her hook
[16:30:58] <jaubourg> gnarf: could be easy enought to wrap this in a deferred and add the proper always callback to maintain the jqXHR and have the abort method
[16:31:08] <timmywil> twss
[16:31:40] <jaubourg> rick: you're too rock'n'roll to play this kind of stuff methinks ;)
[16:31:50] <rwaldron> likely
[16:32:24] <rwaldron> jaubourg this is _my_ band: http://www.myspace.com/chainsawdisasters/music/songs/nuclear-secrets-532293
[16:32:54] <rwaldron> er.. this is better link http://www.myspace.com/chainsawdisasters
[16:33:12] <jaubourg> you don't honestly think I didn't already check?
[16:33:17] <jaubourg> :P
[16:33:34] <rwaldron> talking to me?
[16:33:50] <jaubourg> yep
[16:34:08] <rwaldron> oh, you mean the other link
[16:34:14] <rwaldron> i got confused for a moment
[16:36:21] <rwaldron> jaubourg this is my band from 2003 http://www.myspace.com/mishapboston
[16:36:47] <rwaldron> this is me... in 2003 http://www.myspace.com/mishapboston/photos/214918#%7B%22ImageId%22%3A214918%7D
[16:37:11] <jaubourg> hehe, I remember this pic
[16:38:35] <gnarf> jaubourg: i think I might even be able to add support for multiple queues
[16:39:19] <jaubourg> rwaldron: an ambient track I'm really happy about: http://tfuture.org/julian/Julian%20Hope%20-%20Nextango.mp3
[16:40:00] <darcyclarke> jaubourg that should have been in tron
[16:40:20] <jaubourg> woah thanks :)
[16:40:37] <gnarf> hrm
[16:40:37] <rwaldron> yeah, i def agree
[16:40:50] <gnarf> does anyone know if you could write a gist minifier using uglify?
[16:42:33] <rwaldron> jaubourg is this you on the piano?
[16:42:36] <jaubourg> darcy, rick: I dunno, I think this one http://tfuture.org/julian/Julian%20Hope%20-%20Right%20Ahead,%20Always%202.ogg is more of a tron thingy
[16:42:47] <jaubourg> rick: it's all programmed
[16:42:59] <jaubourg> gnarf: with your own node server?
[16:43:01] <rwaldron> but you prgrammed the piano?
[16:43:05] <jaubourg> yes
[16:43:16] <darcyclarke> so cool man
[16:43:34] <gnarf> jaubourg: yeah, like when I post a gist i can just run my node script on it to minify the .js files
[16:43:51] <darcyclarke> I'm just jamming on my acoustic all day and your here programming music
[16:44:04] <darcyclarke> feel like a noob lol
[16:44:21] <jaubourg> what I do is easy, really, doing real music with an instrument is far superior
[16:45:03] <jaubourg> hang on, where is this test track where I play the guitar again...
[16:45:04] <gnarf> jaubourg: does calling .abort() .reject() the deferred?
[16:45:18] <jaubourg> gnarf: yes iirc
[16:46:15] <jaubourg> oh yeah, this: http://tfuture.org/julian/gotta%20love%20bridget%20-%201989%20-%20realistic.mp3
[16:46:34] <jaubourg> I've been meaning to do vocals for this for ages
[16:50:10] <jaubourg> rick: http://tfuture.org/julian/Julian%20Hope%20-%20Inside%20and%20Out.mp3 <= on this one everything is played on the keyboard we bought together... just a test track but meh
[16:50:14] <darcyclarke> jaubourg lay down some sweet opera esc vocals, have you ever checked out these guys: http://www.myspace.com/protestthehero My not be your cup of tea but the singer has got some sweet pipes
[16:51:24] <jaubourg> oh my 80s hard-rock ahead ;)
[16:51:44] <jaubourg> nice voice indeed
[16:53:24] <jaubourg> hahaha, just found a totally not work safe old cover concept
[16:53:39] <jaubourg> you guys let me know if you want a link
[16:54:04] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/1039247 gisted
[16:57:51] <darcyclarke> gnarf !! I was totally looking for this
[16:58:02] <gnarf> darcyclarke: check out jaubourg's approach too
[16:58:12] <gnarf> darcyclarke: I'm trying to come up with some things to talk about re: queues
[16:58:20] <gnarf> potentially .animate() too
[16:58:30] <gnarf> maybe ui effects
[16:58:30] <darcyclarke> I started somehting like this nearly 3 months ago
[16:58:37] <darcyclarke> and never saw it through
[16:58:50] <gnarf> hrm
[16:58:54] <gnarf> i should make that 1.5+
[16:59:02] <gnarf> by using .then( next, next )
[16:59:49] <jaubourg> heh
[16:59:58] <gnarf> k, its 1.5 compatible now :)
[17:00:53] <jaubourg> darcy: this one is real fun when it starts, intro is quite boring: http://tfuture.org/julian/Julian%20Hope%20-%20Over%20Latte.mp3
[17:02:12] <rwaldron> just listening to the SF-Ghetto keyboard track
[17:02:15] <rwaldron> this is awesome
[17:02:25] <rwaldron> i like it
[17:02:29] <rwaldron> test track or not
[17:02:31] <jaubourg> everything on the keyboard, including the drums
[17:02:33] <jaubourg> ;)
[17:02:37] <rwaldron> we braved some seediness for that
[17:02:40] <rwaldron> wow

[17:04:06] <jaubourg> I also made this one with the keyboard... trying to sound off and live http://tfuture.org/julian/Julian%20Hope%20-%20Duel.mp3 but I think I overdid the off thing
[17:04:45] <jaubourg> oh yeah, and I love spaghetti westerns ;)
[17:05:37] <rwaldron> yeah i do too
[17:06:01] <rwaldron> at txjs, brendan eich's pres was titled "the good, the bad and the ugly"
