[04:53:11] <kborchers> hey guys, not sure who can do it so pinging a bunch of you but http://jquery.com/download/ still points to 1.8.0 ajpiano danheberden DaveMethvin gnarf
[04:59:48] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: I *think* that's because they're waiting on Google.
[05:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> Because of the CDN links on the left.
[05:00:16] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: oh yeah? hmmm, but the home page points to 1.8.0 so it's a little confusing
[05:00:29] <kborchers> 1.8.1*
[05:00:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, not sure. I know Corey committed 1.8.1 for the main download on the right the day of the release.
[05:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> But he didn't deploy.
[05:00:59] <scott_gonzalez> I can only assume it's because he's waiting for the links on the left to match.
[05:01:26] <kborchers> ok, just wanted to make sure someone was aware :)
[05:12:35] <gnarf> did we update to 1.8.1 yet?
[05:12:48] <gnarf> i was waiting for MS / Goog
[05:12:50] <gnarf> but um
[05:12:54] <gnarf> i suppose we could just push it
[05:13:20] <gnarf> neither of them has it
[05:21:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thoughts?
[05:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'd just publish without the updates.
[05:26:01] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe add a note that we have no control over when they update?
[06:01:27] <gnarf> ajpiano: do you have an opinion RE pushing the 1.8.1 links without MS or Goog being updated yet?
[06:01:54] <ajpiano> mixed feelings
[06:02:01] <ajpiano> i don't understand how we are suposed to sit on releases
[06:02:05] <ajpiano> until a 3rd party is ready
[06:02:28] <gnarf> is it better than a 404 link tho?
[07:04:14] <timmywil> mikesherov: you trying to get a hold of me?
[07:08:14] <mikesherov> I was
[07:08:30] <mikesherov> just commented on a few old tickets, wanted your opinion
[07:09:27] <timmywil> cool, which ones?
[07:56:52] <timmywil> mikesherov: I think I got them all
[08:07:50] <gnarf> ajpiano: do you think I should just push the 1.8.1 download page now?
[08:08:13] <ajpiano> yeah, i already got a question over the weekend
[08:08:20] <ajpiano> we could push it with a note until it's on the CDNs
[08:08:25] <gnarf> or do you want to write up some quick "google and microsoft might not have the release" thing to put in that section?
[08:08:30] <ajpiano> or just put a general disclaimer on the there that we don't control hte
[08:08:30] <ajpiano> yeah
[08:08:45] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/blob/master/pages/download.html
[08:10:32] <ajpiano> i mean, quite frankly, i'm not sure why we hock the CDNs as the top level consumption method
[08:12:29] <gnarf> put our CDN on top and then add a "Other CDNs (might take some time to get a new release)" or something
[08:12:32] <gnarf> ?
[08:12:40] <ajpiano> no i just mean cdns in generaly
[08:12:48] <ajpiano> i am so skeptical of the value
[08:13:02] <ajpiano> but for now. we can just add this
[08:13:46] <ajpiano> below the bottom CDN
[08:14:32] <ajpiano> "We do not control the Microsoft or Google CDNs and there may be a delay from the time of a new release until it is available on these CDNs."
[08:14:46] <ajpiano> or just ... "available there."
[08:15:09] <gnarf> might look better under the title above the list?
[08:20:56] <gnarf> ajpiano: http://stage.jquery.com/download/
[08:20:58] <gnarf> :(
[08:21:04] <gnarf> uneven column pain
[08:21:31] <ajpiano> i am thinking make it more disclamier looking
[08:21:47] <ajpiano> smaller font size, less line height
[08:23:20] <ajpiano> gnarf: make it 1.2 em and take the bottom margin off the ul abov eit
[08:23:22] <ajpiano> and it should be already
[08:23:53] <ajpiano> alright
[08:23:56] <ajpiano> sorry for backseat driving
[08:24:39] <gnarf> ajpiano: http://stage.jquery.com/download/
[08:26:17] <ajpiano> put margin-bottom: 0 !important on the li.discalim
[08:27:03] <gnarf> k
[08:28:01] <gnarf> hrm
[08:28:17] <gnarf> I wonder if I copied some of the header style to the download header if it looks better
[08:28:35] <ajpiano> i could see that being the case
[08:29:42] <gnarf> i dunno where to edit that it's in screen.css
[08:29:52] <gnarf> either way, gonna push this
[08:31:51] <ajpiano> yeah, +1
[08:37:52] <gnarf> ajpiano: http://jquery.com/download/
[08:38:22] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/tags -- wasn't sure how we wanted to name these
[08:50:06] <danheberden> gnarf ajpiano: just got up, i like y'alls thinkin
[08:50:27] <ajpiano> A WILD DANHEBERDEN APPEARS
[08:50:45] <danheberden> ajpiano: heh heh, indeed - i'm back and actually have suitable interwebs!
[08:51:13] <danheberden> and some awful stomach bug from mexico
[08:51:15] <ajpiano> howabout that
[08:51:24] <ajpiano> a stomach bug? in mexico
[08:51:27] <ajpiano> WELL I NEVER
[08:51:31] <danheberden> haha
[08:51:35] <danheberden> INORITE?
[08:53:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Adding build numbers seems fine.
[08:54:30] <ajpiano> bot-t: tell DaveMethvin ping
[08:54:30] <bot-t> ajpiano, Okay.
[11:19:44] <paul_irish> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.1/jquery.min.js
[11:29:52] <Krinkle> paul_irish: nice
[11:29:54] <Krinkle> paul_irish: http://jsperf.com/jq-1-7-2-vs-jq-1-8-1-performance-of-mw-has
[11:30:06] <Krinkle> That is among 2 reasons we had to revert to 1.7.2 this morning
[11:30:20] <Krinkle> factor 100 slowdown almost
[11:30:36] <Krinkle> not sure what's going on there
[11:30:38] <ajpiano> yikes
[11:30:46] <ajpiano> Krinkle: can you look at 1.8.0 as well
[11:30:54] <ajpiano> i guess i can add it in
[11:30:58] <Krinkle> sure
[11:31:01] <Krinkle> already doing
[11:31:05] <ajpiano> danke
[11:31:39] <paul_irish> :has() :/
[11:31:49] <Krinkle> the html sample is a wikipedia talk page (without the paragraphs)
[11:31:57] <paul_irish> i feel like webkit is gonna have that natively soon
[11:34:30] <Krinkle> The other problem is slowdown in keydown handlers. There is a js library we use to input foreign characters. Before 1.8.1 (1.8.0 and earlier handle it fine) it was not noticeable, since 1.8.1 it only does like 1 character per second. So typing a word and letting go means you see the remainder appearing character/second afterwards.
[11:34:40] <Krinkle> could be related to http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/30/jquery-1-8-1-released/#comment-532990
[11:34:58] <Krinkle> so that's not en-mass but a single handler and a single user typing.
[11:35:25] <Krinkle> the has selector in that jsperf is causing some IE and FF users to get a "Slow script warning" (Chrome seems faster)
[11:36:04] <ryanneufeld> That is unfortunate
[11:36:12] <ajpiano> Krinkle: hopefully we can get timmywil and mikesherov to take a look at that
[11:36:13] <ryanneufeld> timmywil: have you seen this?
[11:36:17] <Krinkle> a single selector
[11:36:27] <mikesherov> hi
[11:36:31] <ajpiano> the keydown thing is weird, would like to see a jsfiddle of that
[11:36:35] <mikesherov> a wild msherov appears
[11:36:43] <Krinkle> some devs suspect it might be in an infinite loop, though I don't' see a loop warning in Chrome.
[11:36:48] <ryanneufeld> mikesherov: http://jsperf.com/jq-1-7-2-vs-jq-1-8-1-performance-of-mw-has :S
[11:37:44] <mikesherov> woah
[11:37:51] <Krinkle> It used to be h1,2,3,4,5,6 with a find() but I changed it to this a few months ago as that seemed to be faster. Though not sure if it does/should matter.
[11:38:18] <Krinkle> I suppose now the first selector could be native (without Sizzle)
[11:38:36] <Krinkle> does Sizzle optimize for parts of selectors like that? Or is it all or none?
[11:38:55] <mikesherov> I think there's gotta be some sort of infinte loop ther
[11:39:03] <mikesherov> well, maybe not infinite
[11:39:09] <ryanneufeld> Krinkle: perhaps you can do a jsperf with the find()?
[11:39:14] <mikesherov> if it has a measurable ops per second
[11:39:14] <ajpiano> i'm doing that right now
[11:41:02] <ajpiano> http://jsperf.com/jq-1-7-2-vs-jq-1-8-1-performance-of-mw-has/2
[11:41:04] <Krinkle> mikesherov: timmywil ajpiano Chrome profile: http://cl.ly/image/1X3Y2O201o1e
[11:41:19] <Krinkle> that's for 1 run
[11:41:21] <Krinkle> almost a second
[11:41:26] <ajpiano> $jq172('h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6').filter(':has(.editsection a)'); is much faster
[11:41:32] <ajpiano> but it's faster in 1.7.2 than 1.8.1
[11:41:45] <ajpiano> but in 1.8.1 it's faster than the really verbose selector in 1.7.2
[11:41:46] <ajpiano> ... in chrome
[11:42:20] <ajpiano> i would always be going with the $("h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6").filter() approach
[11:43:02] <ryanneufeld> could use grep or find too couldn't you?
[11:43:10] <Krinkle> ajpiano: yeah, me too. I'll g ahead and put that in mediawiki right away
[11:43:17] <ajpiano> i'm trying another thing too
[11:43:27] <Krinkle> oh, I"ll wait then :)
[11:46:58] <ajpiano> woohoo
[11:47:03] <ajpiano> found something super fast
[11:47:06] <ajpiano> fwiw :)
[11:47:10] <ajpiano> http://jsperf.com/jq-1-7-2-vs-jq-1-8-1-performance-of-mw-has/2
[11:47:24] <Krinkle> ajpiano: Oh, now I know why I changed it to not use .filter() - eh... it ahm... it got a new "feature" to work on dynamically inserted headings as well. i.e. .live() (now .on( ..., 'selector' )
[11:47:47] <ajpiano> ah
[11:47:52] <Krinkle> so can't use filter()
[11:47:55] <Krinkle> at least not as a method
[11:48:04] <ajpiano> you can if you just do the filter when the event actually happens
[11:48:07] <ajpiano> instead of paying for it upfront
[11:48:24] <Krinkle> it is a rare event (contextmenu)
[11:48:38] <ajpiano> allt he more reason to not pay for it upfront
[11:48:41] <Krinkle> so the perf is not so in it happening too many times, but the selector being slow
[11:48:56] <ajpiano> $(document).on("click", ".editsection a", function(e) { if ($(e.target).closest("h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6").length) { });
[11:49:31] <Krinkle> the other way around, the event is triggered on the headings
[11:49:48] <ajpiano> tru
[11:49:52] <Krinkle> but only if they have an ".editsection a", but yeah, thx, I'll use it that way
[11:50:17] <ajpiano> obviously this cat is going to find himself skinned :)
[11:50:31] <Krinkle> So this is for the short term (since I need to get mediawiki back on 1.8.1 asap since other scripts are failing as they now expect to be able to use 1.8.1)
[11:50:50] <Krinkle> ideally it should be possible to let jquery/sizzle optimize and not need me to split it up
[11:52:40] <Krinkle> ajpiano: ow... this is annoying. e.target is not the match of the selector but where the click happened
[11:53:02] <ajpiano> that's fine
[11:53:04] <ajpiano> just do it like
[11:53:05] <Krinkle> ajpiano: $( document ).on( 'contextmenu', 'h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6', function ( e ) { e.target is not always the heading, it can be a span inside
[11:53:15] <Krinkle> si can't do e.target.is(' ... ')
[11:53:15] <ajpiano> just makes things easier, really
[11:53:31] <Krinkle> alrighty
[11:53:48] <ajpiano> var heading = $(e.target).closest("h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6"); if (heading.length) { heading.whatevs() } });
[11:55:29] <timmywil> yea, I think I know why it's so much slower. The original set of elements to check can be larger 1.8+ for comma selectors due to the nature of a bottom-up matcher.
[11:57:54] <timmywil> usually, that's fine because it also avoids the need for document sorting
[11:58:44] <timmywil> regardless, I'm working on a new performance suite for Sizzle and jQuery and I plan on tackling performance enhancments now that the rewrite is stable
[11:59:58] <timmywil> fyi, the event delegation performance degradation is unrelated to this regression
[12:00:17] <timmywil> we already have a solution for that
[12:03:56] <Krinkle> ajpiano: http://paste2.org/p/2190573
[12:03:59] <Krinkle> that's what I got now
[12:04:27] <Krinkle> (fyi: this is an opt-in feature - just in case you wanna try it on Wikipedia)
[12:04:55] <Krinkle> oh crap
[12:05:01] <Krinkle> I forgot the actual check
[12:05:32] <Krinkle> Hm.. I might not need it. I can check href to be truthy
[12:07:34] <Krinkle> yeah, http://paste2.org/p/2190581
[12:09:28] <gnarf> Krinkle / ajpiano - $( document ).on( 'contextmenu', '.editsection a', function( event ) { var heading = jQuery( this ).closest( "h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6" ); if ( !heading.length ) { return; } .... }); prolly best
[12:10:08] <Krinkle> how so ? It needs to trigger anywhere on the heading, not just the 10px editsection
[12:10:14] <gnarf> oh
[12:10:17] <gnarf> sorry then
[12:10:27] <Krinkle> np
[12:10:45] <gnarf> Krinkle / ajpiano - $( document ).on( 'contextmenu', 'h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6', function( event ) { var link = jQuery( this ).find( ".editsection a" ); if ( !link.length ) { return; } .... }); prolly best
[12:10:49] <gnarf> :)
[12:11:26] <Krinkle> gnarf: so 'this' is always the heading, right ?
[12:11:33] <gnarf> Krinkle: yup
[12:11:37] <Krinkle> ah, right. obvousy
[12:13:42] <timmywil> Krinkle: sorry about that. I'll see if we can reduce the original set of elements. You actually encountered the two main performance degradations of 1.8.1 in one line.
[12:13:57] <gnarf> as silly as it sounds, I think that splitting that up into .on( event, 'h1', handle ); etc would actually result in the "fastest" performance, cuz it can switch to quickIs for the event matching
[12:14:34] <Krinkle> brb later
[12:14:35] <ajpiano> gnarf: true dat
[12:14:42] <timmywil> quickIs is no more
[12:14:52] <ajpiano> true dat re: .find()
[12:15:12] <gnarf> timmywil: but its still faster with "h1" "h2" "h3" "h4" "h5" "h6" as possible selectors than "h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6" ?
[12:15:56] <gnarf> or is it optimized for tagname checks like that
[12:16:24] <timmywil> yea that would be a bit faster
[12:16:38] <timmywil> cause it would go straight to gEBTN
[12:17:26] <timmywil> however, once we switch event.js to use .is() again, it won't make much of a difference
[12:18:10] <timmywil> dave had changed it to a selection + .index() in order to fix a bug related to event context
[12:18:21] <timmywil> which killed
[12:18:38] <timmywil> but we can swtich it back to .is() and add $.contains
[12:19:05] <timmywil> which should simply match against one element rather than do a selection
[12:30:06] <Krinkle> ajpiano: any suggestions? http://paste2.org/p/2190627
[12:34:24] <ajpiano> seems ok!
[12:51:30] <Krinkle> timmywil: which two per degragations ?
[12:57:51] <timmywil> Krinkle: custom comma selectors on the entire document and event delegation
[13:02:03] <Krinkle> ok
[13:02:17] <Krinkle> timmywil: there's bug reports for those?
[13:03:45] <timmywil> for the second one at least
[13:18:59] <timmywil> gnarf: noticed this?
[13:19:01] <timmywil> https://github.com/blog/1227-status-api
[13:19:44] <timmywil> mmm, maybe we couldn't use that
[13:20:23] <paul_irish> hot
[13:21:25] <gnarf> I'm pretty sure I could get that to work with some help from scott_gonzalez :)
[13:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> get what?
[13:21:44] <gnarf> github commit status api ^^^
[13:22:07] <gnarf> looks like a postreceive + a callback, but like add in some logic to run grunt / swarm / etc
[13:22:16] <gnarf> all automated
[13:22:20] <gnarf> no spammy botio
[13:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> Oh nice.
[13:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we can get that working.
[13:23:28] <timmywil> that would be awesome
[13:23:31] <timmywil> js
[13:23:36] <DaveMethvin> they're reading our minds
[13:23:36] <bot-t> (4 hours 29 mins ago) <ajpiano> tell DaveMethvin ping
[13:23:48] <DaveMethvin> i already talked to that guy
[13:29:23] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/485
[13:30:24] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: ^
[13:30:37] <scott_gonzalez> Notice that it's pending :-)
[13:32:08] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: nice!
[13:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if you can just keep changing the status on the same commit.
[13:33:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, you can bounce back and forth between success, error, pending, etc.
[13:34:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You can play around with this: https://gist.github.com/3626141
[13:34:41] <scott_gonzalez> Should be easy to modify, just add params for the account, repo, and sha.
[13:51:05] <jaubourg> plop
[14:06:42] <jaubourg> too many mikes
[14:10:19] <miketaylr> not enough man
[14:15:50] <ryanneufeld> needs more ryan's
[14:16:09] <ryanneufeld> there can only be one jaubourg
[14:25:06] <jaubourg> ryanneufeld: thank god given the mouthful it is in english
[14:25:41] <ryanneufeld> not so much a mouthful, but a tongue twister
[14:51:20] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: running into a weird error in qunit
[14:51:40] <Krinkle> http://cl.ly/image/2f411m3b2i0v
[14:51:55] <Krinkle> it uses assert.deelEqual(foo, { .. }, ..);
[14:51:59] <Krinkle> where foo = new Foo();
[14:52:31] <Krinkle> why doesn't it compare it, I don't get it
[14:56:20] <Krinkle> A figured it out by adding debugger; in qunit.js internals
[14:56:27] <Krinkle> the .constructor property is being compared
[14:57:33] <Krinkle> too bad, would be nice to have a deepEqual that only goes into own properties for easy testing
[15:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh no, we're breaking Opera!!!!11
[15:10:31] <DaveMethvin> Notify their user!
[15:13:40] <ajpiano> woohoo ryanneufeld you are order #1
[15:13:54] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: FINALLY I'M FIRST!!
[15:14:07] <ryanneufeld> ack -caps
[15:14:13] <ryanneufeld> cruise control was on
[15:14:22] <ryanneufeld> I am excite
[15:14:51] <ryanneufeld> So, I have a full stack ticket... how do I get my deets?
[15:15:19] <ryanneufeld> oh, hotel only... gotta book a flight
[15:16:01] <jaubourg> mine is already booked ;)
[15:20:24] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: what other deets do you need
[15:20:47] <ryanneufeld> thought flights were in there... but I failed at reading
[15:21:04] <ajpiano> ah
[15:21:26] <ryanneufeld> are flights out of pocket?
[15:21:39] <ajpiano> not for team members
[15:21:47] <ajpiano> aka, you
[15:22:08] <ryanneufeld> coolbeans
[15:22:19] <ryanneufeld> I was gonna see if work would pay for it :p
[15:22:35] <ryanneufeld> They usually do
[15:23:06] <ajpiano> you can still let them ;)
[15:23:51] <ryanneufeld> haha, well, I was thinking, whoever ends up sharing a room w/ me
[15:23:57] <ryanneufeld> better have earplugs
[15:24:04] <ryanneufeld> my wife needs em to sleep w/ me
[15:24:06] <ryanneufeld> :S
[15:25:03] <ajpiano> heheh
[15:25:47] <ryanneufeld> "you snore like a lawnmower" is a phrase I'm too familiar with
[15:26:07] <jaubourg> btw ajpiano: where is the hotel?
[15:26:11] <jaubourg> and hi :)
[15:27:45] <ajpiano> hi jaubourg  :)
[15:27:55] <ajpiano> looking forward to seeing your smiling face soon :)
[15:27:56] <ajpiano> http://goo.gl/maps/mRkkw
[15:28:01] <jaubourg> =)
[15:29:24] <jaubourg> woah, everything's so close :)
[15:38:31] <ryanneufeld> neato
[15:38:43] <ryanneufeld> What's the weather like there that time of year?
[15:38:49] <ryanneufeld> never been to the east coast
[15:39:07] <ajpiano> mediocre
[15:39:34] <ajpiano> like, mid 50s
[15:39:37] <ryanneufeld> as in? rain? snow? sleet? locusts?
[15:39:55] <ajpiano> i can only really speak for new york
[15:40:05] <ajpiano> it's not that bad really, starts to get a touch chilly but not necessarily
[15:40:19] <ryanneufeld> so hoodie weather?
[15:40:29] <ajpiano> yea
[15:40:48] <ryanneufeld> k, I can cope with that
[15:57:51] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: yt?
[16:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Should we be registering with package b?
[16:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> We're actually staying till Thursday, right?
[16:02:38] <ajpiano> we are supposed to be registering with the Team discount code of $0.00
[16:02:42] <ajpiano> which should have everything covered
[16:02:47] <ajpiano> there's a code in your email
[16:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see, that adds a new ticket type.
[16:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it was just going to drop the price.
[16:03:12] <ajpiano> ya
[16:03:44] <ryanneufeld> so we're checked in till thursday am?
[16:04:51] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: ^^
[16:05:25] <ajpiano> i'm not entirely sure, it might be slightly different for team vs people who are staying thru thursdays meeting
[16:05:35] <ryanneufeld> aahh
[16:05:36] <ryanneufeld> right
[16:05:43] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: can you write an e-mail to events@jquery.org, they will know better than me :p
[16:05:49] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[16:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, here we go. Now I'm the one breaking Opera...
[16:12:22] <DaveMethvin> YEAH SCOTT
[16:12:36] <DaveMethvin> create a ticket fast and then close his as a dup
[16:12:45] <jaubourg> HOIW DARE YOU SCOTT111
[16:13:06] <jaubourg> gotta love rage-tickets
[16:13:09] <DaveMethvin> imagine how that Opera user must feel right now
[16:16:06] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: Still superior to any IE user i would imagine
[16:16:23] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: but greatly outnumbered
[16:16:37] <ryanneufeld> oh it's lonely at the top
[16:17:03] <ryanneufeld> nothing like truncating an entire database to make your day! DERP
[16:17:14] <ryanneufeld> thankfully it was only a dev db
[16:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> I really hope he doesn't file a ticket for UI.
[16:18:33] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise we'll have to go down the same road of posting screenshots of there not being a problem.
[16:19:39] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i suspect he's combining core, ui, and his own stuff into a big lump and then blaming us rather than his compressor
[16:19:46] <DaveMethvin> which is what the twitter thing was about
[16:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> probably
[16:59:30] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: ?
[16:59:39] <ryanneufeld> heysup
[16:59:52] <ryanneufeld> I don't even remember what I was gonna ask you now
[16:59:56] <ryanneufeld> must not have been that important
[18:02:13] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[18:02:41] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell scott_gonzalez I'll just leave this here for you: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12459
[18:02:42] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[18:48:24] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Yeah, I'm just wiating for him to file the UI ticket so we can go through another round of screenshots...
[18:48:24] <bot-t> (45 mins 40 secs ago) <mikesherov> tell scott_gonzalez I'll just leave this here for you: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12459
[18:48:36] <mikesherov> LOL
[18:48:41] <mikesherov> YOU are breaking Opera
[18:49:06] <mikesherov> We are literally going into the source code and ruining Opera
[18:50:48] <scott_gonzalez> Indeed. That's what browser.js is for, backdoors for script libs to break Opera :-)
[18:52:22] <scott_gonzalez> What time is 16:00Z ?
[18:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> Is that like 4:00p GMT?
[18:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...yeah: http://timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20120905T12&p1=43
[18:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> This WG meets like every day. This is crazy.
[19:12:46] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yt?
[19:12:53] <DaveMethvin> yep
[19:12:58] <mikesherov> hello!
[19:13:05] <mikesherov> I feel like I haven't bugged you in a bit
[19:13:19] <mikesherov> doing some triage
[19:13:35] <DaveMethvin> well BUG AWAY!
[19:13:37] <mikesherov> there are a few tixx that may or may not be stale and closeable
[19:14:21] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12406
[19:14:34] <mikesherov> which is a dupe of: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9832
[19:15:00] <mikesherov> are we ever going to fix that?
[19:15:54] <DaveMethvin> let's open it for 1.9-discuss
[19:16:00] <mikesherov> k
[19:16:02] <DaveMethvin> i think it's too much of a pain
[19:16:12] <DaveMethvin> a stylesheet is a thing unto its own
[19:16:21] <DaveMethvin> and there are stylesheet manager plugins
[19:16:23] <mikesherov> sure, we need to check if the object is a stylesheet and not a DOM node
[19:16:53] <mikesherov> so, just add 1.9-discuss
[19:16:54] <DaveMethvin> it just seems ugly but if we WERE going to do it 1.9 would be the time
[19:17:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:17:27] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9832#comment:5
[19:18:01] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12416
[19:18:19] <DaveMethvin> well if it's working ... :D
[19:18:25] <mikesherov> so, magically fixed...
[19:18:34] <mikesherov> I have a few "magically fixed" tixx
[19:19:35] <mikesherov> and so for some of them, I'm inclined to just tag as 1.8.1 milestone and resolve as fixed
[19:19:47] <mikesherov> the others, I'm going to write unit tests
[19:19:56] <mikesherov> this one seems like it's fine to just close
[19:20:13] <mikesherov> because it wasn't in the magical 1.8 rewrite
[19:20:20] <DaveMethvin> ok
[19:20:25] <DaveMethvin> and yeah we need some more unit tests
[19:20:40] <DaveMethvin> timmywil is going to work on some basic perf regression tests
[19:20:44] <DaveMethvin> which we also need
[19:20:56] <DaveMethvin> considering i blew away delegated event perf :.
[19:20:59] <mikesherov> so 12416 I'm just closing
[19:21:06] <DaveMethvin> ok
[19:21:23] <mikesherov> yeah, several things we're missing:
[19:21:50] <mikesherov> 1. ability to have unit test load in various ways (XHTML, HTML5, CSP)
[19:22:00] <mikesherov> 2. ability to have unit tests against CORS
[19:22:12] <mikesherov> 3. ability to do perf testing in a consistent way
[19:22:44] <mikesherov> 4. ability to have a common server side environment (PHP local and PHP on swarm are different)
[19:22:59] <mikesherov> 4a. standardize on node so we can be assured of common backend config
[19:23:13] <mikesherov> so
[19:23:16] <mikesherov> there's that
[19:23:31] <DaveMethvin> agreed on all of those
[19:24:02] <DaveMethvin> a lot of the issues are ajax related, those tests could be cleaned up a bit to reduce the apache/ngnix issues
[19:24:29] <DaveMethvin> we're tryna POST to a static html page and ngnix doesn't like that :)
[19:25:12] <mikesherov> yeah
[19:25:34] <mikesherov> well, if we ever want to do some goofy thing like test document.readyState === "interactive"
[19:25:45] <mikesherov> then we need server side config to be same as local
[19:25:54] <DaveMethvin> YOU"RE TALKING CRAZY TALK AGAIN MIKE
[19:26:53] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[19:26:57] <mikesherov> ok, next up: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9960
[19:27:06] <mikesherov> the fix is literally in the fiddle
[19:27:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah seems easy
[19:28:03] <mikesherov> so, we need XML tests to append to document?
[19:28:11] <mikesherov> or is that just the use case?
[19:28:29] <mikesherov> i.e. can I write a unit for this that doesn't require me to create an XMLDoc?
[19:28:47] <DaveMethvin> we have some xml test cases so that's not a problem
[19:28:53] <DaveMethvin> just use $.parseXML
[19:29:02] <mikesherov> and that creates a document?
[19:29:30] <DaveMethvin> it should
[19:29:40] <mikesherov> with nodetype 9?
[19:29:57] <mikesherov> OK doke
[19:29:59] <DaveMethvin> lemme check for sure
[19:31:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah the result of parseXML is a document node
[19:31:13] <mikesherov> cool
[19:31:20] <mikesherov> Then that's that
[19:32:14] <DaveMethvin> btw, if i go into porn imma take the name Rod Vagg
[19:32:54] <mikesherov> LOL
[19:33:45] <mikesherov> OK, next up: our list of trac reports...
[19:34:13] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?keywords=~needsreview&status=%21closed&report=405&order=id
[19:34:19] <mikesherov> we don't use needsreview anymore
[19:34:30] <DaveMethvin> right
[19:34:41] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=%21closed&summary=~regression&or&status=%21closed&keywords=~regression&report=6&order=priority
[19:34:48] <mikesherov> we don't use regression anymore
[19:35:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah there's too much detail on a lot of thoe
[19:35:30] <scott_gonzalez> You guys know this is the only report that matters: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/report/29
[19:36:04] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/report/104 we don't really use voting anymore
[19:36:06] <DaveMethvin> report 29: print("shitloads")
[19:36:14] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[19:36:55] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: you can vote a ticket up/down but we rarely look at it
[19:36:59] <mikesherov> so, can I just kill those reports that don't make any freaking sense
[19:37:09] <DaveMethvin> sure
[19:37:13] <DaveMethvin> i was thinking about doing that
[19:37:22] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/report/305
[19:37:23] <DaveMethvin> really the old version reports don't make a lot of sense
[19:37:28] <mikesherov> OK
[19:37:40] <DaveMethvin> chop chop!
[19:37:43] <mikesherov> so can we just go down the list and yay or nay?
[19:37:51] <DaveMethvin> lemme pull it up
[19:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> We use 1 version report for UI and it's the next version.
[19:38:17] <mikesherov> Open regressions: nay
[19:38:18] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: that makes sense
[19:38:31] <DaveMethvin> 6 dies
[19:38:36] <DaveMethvin> 7 dies
[19:39:12] <DaveMethvin> 103 104 die
[19:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> The one I use the most is one that just filters by component.
[19:39:25] <DaveMethvin> 200-206 die
[19:39:27] <scott_gonzalez>  /report/10?P=dialog
[19:39:32] <mikesherov> I like 103
[19:40:02] <DaveMethvin> we can keep 103 although for me it's like "all tickets since time began"
[19:41:50] <mikesherov> LOL
[19:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> 103 seems kinda cool. I wonder how often I would want to use that for UI.
[19:42:32] <mikesherov> 401,400 gone
[19:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> How did you get custom report ids?
[19:43:08] <mikesherov> 403 gone?
[19:43:27] <ryanneufeld> anyone heard of DaVinci studio?
[19:43:29] <DaveMethvin> 403 gone
[19:43:51] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: not ringing a bell with me
[19:43:59] <ryanneufeld> I just got an email from them
[19:44:22] <ryanneufeld> claiming they are a sliver sponser for “jQuery Conference Asia 2012 in Seoul”
[19:44:32] <ryanneufeld> Spam?
[19:44:33] <DaveMethvin> oh they might be
[19:44:45] <DaveMethvin> we just licensed someone to give that conf
[19:44:49] <ryanneufeld> ah
[19:44:56] <ryanneufeld> how would they have got my email address?
[19:45:00] <DaveMethvin> you could send it on to richard worth
[19:45:14] <DaveMethvin> you're on the internets ryanneufeld
[19:45:19] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: They're not a silver sponser of the conf, they're a silver member of jQuery Foundation and hosting the conf.
[19:45:20] <ryanneufeld> I'm already a little miffed that Telerik was soliciting me
[19:45:22] <DaveMethvin> everybody knows where you live
[19:45:32] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[19:45:37] <ryanneufeld> I suppose you're right
[19:45:50] <DaveMethvin> and you're wearing THAT shirt? cmon
[19:46:28] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: any others you want to remove?
[19:46:40] <DaveMethvin> i created contribs but it's not that useful
[19:46:40] <ryanneufeld> I have tinfoil on my windows... how you see me?!
[19:46:50] <mikesherov> 405
[19:47:14] <DaveMethvin> k
[19:47:30] <mikesherov> 501, 503
[19:48:46] <mikesherov> IRC topic needs updating
[19:48:55] <mikesherov> it still references report 405
[19:49:00] <mikesherov> which I just killed
[19:49:18] <mikesherov> deleting 501,503 now
[19:49:21] <DaveMethvin> ok
[19:49:35] <DaveMethvin> i tweaked 404 to not show new/pending bugs
[19:49:52] <DaveMethvin> we sometimes can't categorize until we get a test case
[19:50:26] <mikesherov> 207 killing too
[19:50:29] <mikesherov> and I think that's it
[19:50:43] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[19:51:25] <mikesherov> last but not least, I promise: 305
[19:52:01] <DaveMethvin> since we all get emails it's not needed
[19:52:15] <mikesherov> yeah
[19:52:16] <DaveMethvin> oh 305
[19:52:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah don't need that
[19:52:38] <mikesherov> ok, done
[19:52:44] <DaveMethvin> ?topic
[19:52:44] <bot-t> Topic: jQuery developmen
[19:53:07] <DaveMethvin> well bot-t you don't need to be so short with me
[19:53:20] <mikesherov> jQuery development chat. Support chat (using jQuery, writing plugins, or other inquiries) is at #jquery. Triage team: Unreviewed tickets at http://bugs.jquery.com/report/400 - Tickets Needing Review: http://bugs.jquery.com/report/405 - 1.8 Suggestion Box http://gul.ly/d72 | This channel is publicly logged to http://irc.jquery.com
[19:53:34] <mikesherov> even includes 1.8 suggestion box!
[19:53:35] <mikesherov> WOW
[19:54:10] <mikesherov> so report 400 works, but because it's a misnomer
[19:54:54] <mikesherov> 400 and 401 just have things that are not "needsreview"
[19:55:31] <DaveMethvin> whoops
[19:55:50] <DaveMethvin> like nobody reads it anyway
[19:56:02] <mikesherov> I'm going to make a report that mirrors "Triage: Open tickets without a filed component" that's called "Triage: Open tickets without a filed priority" and then get rid of 400 and 401
[19:56:20] <DaveMethvin> that sounds good
[19:56:28] <DaveMethvin> just number that one 400
[19:57:38] <DaveMethvin> we also need to remove the feature/enhancement split
[20:02:20] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: look at the 400 series now: http://bugs.jquery.com/report
[20:02:31] <mikesherov> that should be all of the triage stuff
[20:03:37] <DaveMethvin> so the process is that as soon as we can figure out what it IS, we can give it a priority ... yeah. :)
[20:04:30] <DaveMethvin> damn gotta work on those needsdocs
[20:04:42] <DaveMethvin> we should have about 10 docs tables at the summit
[20:06:08] <DaveMethvin> needsdocs: do not taunt $.makeArray
[20:06:57] <mikesherov> so 400-406 + 505 is the new triage reports
[20:07:12] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[20:07:16] <mikesherov> seems to me that's what we need to really stay on top of incoming
[20:07:22] <DaveMethvin> so clean now!
[20:07:24] <mikesherov> do what you will with the topic
[20:08:52] <DaveMethvin> ok mikesherov i need to take off
[20:09:00] <mikesherov> have a nice night
[20:09:02] <DaveMethvin> thanks for your help!
