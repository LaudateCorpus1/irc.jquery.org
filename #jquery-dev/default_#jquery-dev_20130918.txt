[12:39:27] <miketaylr> arschmitz: ping!
[12:39:41] <arschmitz> miketaylr: Pong!
[12:39:46] <miketaylr> ugh, so sorry
[12:39:54] <miketaylr> got distracted by shenanigans
[12:40:06] <arschmitz> not a problem
[12:40:50] <miketaylr> so.
[12:41:00] <miketaylr> just wanted to float this idea
[12:41:12] <miketaylr> and maybe we can hash it out via email or other means
[12:41:15] <miketaylr> or whatever
[12:41:19] <arschmitz> sure
[12:41:33] <miketaylr> but basically just wanted to have my/our finger very close to jquery mobile's pulse
[12:41:43] <miketaylr> and eventually find out where all the bugs/workarounds are
[12:42:23] <miketaylr> does jqmobile use testswarm?
[12:42:29] <miketaylr> or some other kind of CI?
[12:42:37] <arschmitz> we use travis mostly
[12:42:52] <miketaylr> i'm guessing 4 seconds of google could have answered that >_>
[12:43:08] <miketaylr> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile :D
[12:43:11] <arschmitz> lol thats ok thats what im here for :)
[12:43:20] <miketaylr> ok cool, so i can monitor that
[12:43:41] <arschmitz> yup
[12:44:09] <miketaylr> i guess ideally i just want to know about everywhere that jquery core or mobile is breaking or being weird for firefox os or firefox for android
[12:44:11] <miketaylr> desktop too
[12:44:22] <miketaylr> (but i'm focusing more on mobile)
[12:44:25] <arschmitz> do you actually have like ten minutes to do a skype call ?
[12:44:30] <miketaylr> sure
[12:44:31] <miketaylr> one sec
[12:44:36] <arschmitz> sure
[12:44:39] <miketaylr> oh lol
[12:44:41] <miketaylr> don't have skype installed
[12:44:43] <miketaylr> new laptop
[12:44:47] <miketaylr> ok give me like 3 mins
[12:44:52] <arschmitz> lol not a problem
[12:45:36] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: Ping!
[12:45:55] <DaveMethvin> sup arschmitz
[12:46:33] <arschmitz> miketaylr: had mentioned tracking firefox bugs on core as well as mobile so thought if you had a few minutes you might want to join us to talk about this?
[12:47:15] <DaveMethvin> sure
[12:47:33] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: cool he said he just needed a couple minutes
[12:47:50] <DaveMethvin> ok just ping me, we can do irc or skype
[12:47:59] <miketaylr> just finished downloading
[12:49:27] <miketaylr> ok arschmitz: i'm miketayl_r on skype
