[13:08:59] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: you  have to pass an empty string to createHTMLDocument("")
[13:09:10] <DaveMethvin> so say the internets
[13:09:52] <snover> Sure
[13:11:05] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: that would explain IE failures, I guess :)
[13:11:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:12:22] <DaveMethvin> i guess the others make it optional but the spec does seem to say it's needed http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/CR-DOM-Level-2-20000510/html.html#ID-HTML-DOM

[13:20:47] <m_gol> but only WD etc.
[13:21:28] <DaveMethvin> well in any case, we need an empty string there :)
[13:21:58] <m_gol> sure ;)
[13:24:25] <snover> why wonâ€™t you just let everything be broken daaaaaavvveee
[13:24:28] <snover> come onnnnnnn
[13:25:07] <DaveMethvin> it's broken by default

[13:38:14] <timmywil> I tested IE 9/10. We'll see how that does
[13:41:18] <timmywil> Looks better now, but Safari 8 is still whining about something.
[13:41:43] <DaveMethvin> the selector is still broken right?
[13:41:47] <DaveMethvin> or did that land today?
[13:41:55] <timmywil> yea, that selector test and...
[13:42:02] <timmywil> some event bubbling thing

[13:44:40] <m_gol> timmywil: Sauce Labs does have Safari 8: https://saucelabs.com/platforms
[13:45:03] <timmywil> ah, was looking at mavericks
[13:45:52] <m_gol> this data-url script test is flakey
[13:46:13] <m_gol> fails quite frequently; we need to improve it
[13:46:46] <timmywil> ah, I think the bubbling is related to the selector failure
[13:47:07] <timmywil> so our patch should fix that
[13:47:23] <m_gol> how so? it didn't fail before
[13:47:36] <DaveMethvin> delegated events?

[13:47:40] <doesallmagic2> Dave Methvin: Css: Remove non-functional unit test for negative margin
[13:48:02] <timmywil> well, let me dig deeper then
[13:48:08] <timmywil> I assumed delegation
[13:48:40] <m_gol> it doesn't fail on compat :)
[13:48:48] <timmywil> seemed unlikely safari 8 also has a createHTMLDocument difference
[13:51:35] <m_gol> it fails consistently now and didn't before this commit so sth must have changed
[13:51:53] <m_gol> I've reset an older run to make sure it's not BrowserStack fault and it passed
[13:51:54] <timmywil> yea, just strange safari 8 is the only one

[13:52:13] <doesallmagic2> Dave Methvin: Css: Remove non-functional unit test for negative margin
[13:59:41] <DaveMethvin> timmywil m_gol given that the failing event test uses parseHTML it probably is a real failure https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/4ab743188ec6bdaafe8550dab84f374ef7e22aca/test/unit/event.js#L1115
[13:59:52] <timmywil> I'm looking into it
[14:02:57] <timmywil> an element is missing somehow
[14:03:38] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15AustP opened issue #1919: css/hiddenVisibleSelectors "../selector" dependency should be "../selector-sizzle" 02http://git.io/EDoXaQ
[14:05:37] <timmywil> yea, #testForm doesn't make it through parsing
[14:05:53] <timmywil> well, that's weird
[14:07:15] <DaveMethvin> sounds like we may have found another Safari bug, oh joy
[14:08:21] <timmywil> ugh, now I need to narrow this down
[14:08:39] <DaveMethvin> you could back it out
[14:08:55] <timmywil> I should know the problem first
[14:09:44] <m_gol> Safari 7 seems more stable than 8
[14:09:47] <DaveMethvin> well it's sending the entire fixture's HTML to the new parsing using document.createHTMLDocument so if there ever was a torture test this is it :)
[14:09:53] <m_gol> that mirrors Yosemite being more buggy than Mavericks
[14:09:59] <m_gol> haha
[14:10:36] <m_gol> if this is Safari bug then they have sth really nasty there
[14:11:05] <DaveMethvin> DAMN YOU, EFFECTIVE UNIT TESTS!
[14:11:15] <timmywil> inorite, 1 test
[14:11:39] <DaveMethvin> this is like that little flake of paint on your car that turns out to be a whole bucket of rust
[14:13:45] <timmywil> hmm, has something to do with the HTML before it
[14:13:58] <timmywil> maybe a missing closing tag?
[14:15:50] <DaveMethvin> i guess that's possible, strange that it only affects Safari
[14:16:30] <m_gol> * only Safari 8
[14:16:47] <DaveMethvin> the WORST of all Safaris
[14:17:13] <m_gol> Safari 5.1 still passes our test suite
[14:17:41] <m_gol> mostly by the virtue of us keeping all these Android 2.3 hacks; funny how much they share despite having different JS engines
[14:23:42] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15AustP opened issue #1920: Should ajax.js depend on ajax/xhr.js? 02http://git.io/3oYIsA
[14:45:21] <timmywil> Wow, this is crazy.
[14:45:56] <timmywil> no matter the order or which ones I take out, it always ends up with one form containing the other forms
[14:46:26] <timmywil> I still have no idea what's going on, but we can't fix that.
[14:46:51] <m_gol> O_O
[14:47:42] <timmywil> actually, this could more accurately be described as "forms don't close"
[14:47:55] <timmywil> it's as if we didn't put in any closing tags for forms
[14:49:16] <timmywil> so the end always looks like this https://www.dropbox.com/s/aakrg1vvk2lji7o/Screenshot%202014-12-09%2017.49.06.png?dl=0
[14:49:47] <timmywil> that be messed up
[14:50:02] <snover> i feel like this is a natural conclusion to bureaucracy
[14:50:05] <snover> forms that never end
[14:50:30] <m_gol> snover: that perfectly sums up our recent experience with Apple
[14:50:42] <m_gol> questions that never get answered
[14:51:34] <m_gol> internal policy or sth
[14:52:06] <snover> well you see, weâ€™ll never be able to steal their new DOM selector innovations if we donâ€™t know about them
[14:52:11] <m_gol> because the crowd at WWDC will be interested in if the bug is going to be fixed or not
[14:52:50] <m_gol> or that
[14:52:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: given this bureaucracy, you vote to back it out?
[14:53:21] <m_gol> timmywil: can you reproduce it on a trivial example?
[14:53:23] <snover> you want to back out safari 8?
[14:53:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah let's back it out for now then, and regroup ... maybe another thing to mention in our blog post :)
[14:53:28] <snover> sounds like a good idea
[14:53:37] <snover> iâ€™d like to back out safari 8 too
[14:53:38] <m_gol> snover: +1
[14:53:57] <DaveMethvin> maybe we can drop support for safari in our next release :)
[14:54:03] <m_gol> snover: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/290
[14:54:10] <timmywil> m_gol: the next step will be to construct an example without using jQuery, but I need to work on other things now
[14:54:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah, understood, when PRs get to be this much of a mess it's better to just regroup
[14:55:00] <m_gol> timmywil: we may back it out for now and try later
[14:55:10] <timmywil> yea, maybe
[14:56:22] <snover> i wonder what is the meanest word you can get away with putting in the code
