[10:51:07] <danissa518> Hi

[10:51:47] <danissa518> I upload the code somewere if someone want to help me please :)
[10:54:50] <miketaylr> danissa518: better to ask in #jquery
[11:05:05] <danissa518> thks
[14:49:13] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, do we have a meeting this Monday? :)
[14:49:40] <DaveMethvin> we darn well should m_gol! I am actually going to be here
[14:49:40] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[14:49:47] <DaveMethvin> `read
[14:49:47] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: From m_gol, 5d 15m ago: do we plan a meeting on Monday considering a part of the team is in Austin?
[14:49:51] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:49:51] <m_gol> great, I started to miss it!
[14:49:53] <m_gol> hahahaha
[14:50:05] <m_gol> you don't have to answer
[14:50:06] <m_gol> ;P
[14:50:20] <DaveMethvin> that's all in the past now :)
[14:50:25] <m_gol> :)
[14:50:35] <m_gol> I've seen timmywil has been on fire recently :D
[14:50:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah you get that guy drunk and he can really program! 
[14:50:57] <m_gol> :D
[14:51:15] <m_gol> I started to think if we shouldn't prepare an official GUI jQuery custom builder
[14:51:22] <m_gol> since almost no one does that atm
[14:51:46] <m_gol> you have to clone the repo, checkout to the proper tag, do npm install, then a correct grunt command... it's not so obvious
[14:52:00] <DaveMethvin> now that we have AMD maybe it would make sense, although i am still worried that people have no idea what their dependencies are in an average web page (vs web app)
[14:52:08] <DaveMethvin> but i guess they wouldn't use the tool!
[14:52:11] <DaveMethvin> so there
[14:52:33] <m_gol> because I've seen a lot of criticism about how using jQuery do everything is not a good choice
[14:52:52] <m_gol> I agree if you do a static page with a couple of animations then you can go without it
[14:53:08] <m_gol> but when I mention custom builds then I always get a response: "how many people use it?"
[14:53:21] <m_gol> so I figured making it a little easier for people to use might improve the situation
[14:53:47] <DaveMethvin> i have a feeling that it's easier for people to complain than use just about any tool
[14:53:52] <m_gol> hahaha
[14:53:53] <DaveMethvin> but yeah
[14:54:35] <m_gol> we shouldn't expose all grunt options, though
[14:54:45] <m_gol> you can compile 9000 bytes jQuery then :P
[14:54:49] <m_gol> doing almost nothing
[14:54:55] <DaveMethvin> but it's small!
[14:55:19] <m_gol> I have a smaller version
[14:55:23] <m_gol> var jQuery = {};
[14:55:31] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:55:46] <DaveMethvin> i'll wait for someone to file a bug against that
[14:55:50] <m_gol> ;)
[14:56:10] <DaveMethvin> BUG: jQuery.fn != jQuery.prototype
[14:56:32] <m_gol> bug: "hi, if I exclude all modules, jQuery doesn't have any methods"
[14:57:05] <m_gol> haha, yours is better
[14:58:32] <m_gol> do you think anyone will use jQuery AMD modules without compilation?
[14:58:39] <m_gol> that's a lot of files :)
[14:58:52] <DaveMethvin> maybe during dev, but i wouldn't think it's common
[14:59:26] <m_gol> I love that my editor (PyCharm/WebStorm) doesn't highlight half of the file on red because they're defined in another file anymore :)
[14:59:34] <m_gol> easier to find real bugs
[14:59:42] <DaveMethvin> yes, and harder to get sneak dependencies
[14:59:55] <miketaylr> who's in charge of jqmobile these days? i missed all the keynotes at the conf >_>
[15:00:54] <DaveMethvin> i would blame arschmitz and jasper for mobile :)
[15:00:59] <m_gol> :)
[15:01:00] <miketaylr> oh busted
[15:01:16] <miketaylr> arschmitz: & jasper, i wanna chat about stuffs one day next week
[15:01:20] <miketaylr> YOUVE BEEN WARNED
[15:01:27] <DaveMethvin> i forget jasper's handle
[15:01:36] <miketaylr> cool_guy2006
[15:01:41] <miketaylr> probably
[15:01:57] <DaveMethvin> no that's mine when i'm idle
[15:02:22] <DaveMethvin> hey thanks for hanging out with us miketaylr, nice bat bridge you got there
[15:02:38] <miketaylr> were there any bats, DaveMethvin?
[15:02:49] <miketaylr> i know there's like a "bat season" i just have no idea when that is
[15:03:02] <DaveMethvin> more bats came out of that bridge than bugs out of my code
[15:03:19] <DaveMethvin> in fact my code could feed a bat colony for several months
[15:03:27] <DaveMethvin> why is it 60 degrees inside the buildings but 90 outside in austin?
[15:03:33] <miketaylr> sweet
[15:03:41] <miketaylr> i dunno, i had the insane AC
[15:03:45] <miketaylr> i keep my house at 75
[15:04:27] <m_gol> I read your sentences in European units in my mind
[15:04:38] <m_gol> 60 degrees C seems really hot, indeed! :P
[15:04:46] <miketaylr> `tell arschmitz hi! can you send me an email -> miket@mozilla.com would like to talk about fireox os/mobile stuff thankssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
[15:04:46] <b-ot> miketaylr: Iâ€™ll tell arschmitz about that.
[15:04:52] <miketaylr> you better, b-ot
[15:05:21] <DaveMethvin> alright, gotta run
[15:05:26] <miketaylr> DaveMethvin: laters
[15:05:32] <miketaylr> save travels, assuming you ever leave the bat bridge
