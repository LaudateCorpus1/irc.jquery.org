[11:31:15] <scottgonzalez> DaveMethvin: Thoughts on http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8464 ?
[11:31:24] <scottgonzalez> Should we be using document.body everything instead of $( "body" ) ?
[11:36:29] <DaveMethvin> that was a long time ago ... did something new happen?
[11:36:50] <DaveMethvin> in any case scott_gonzalez yeah document.body is gonna be faster too
[11:37:17] <DaveMethvin> as long as nobody uses UI in a frameset document you're fine
[11:38:23] <DaveMethvin> oic, on the pull request
[11:39:21] <scottgonzalez> Yeah, I came from the PR and was wondering why there were multiple bodies in the first place.
[11:39:31] <scottgonzalez> After looking at the ticket again, it makes sense.
[11:39:34] <scottgonzalez> Just seems annoying.
[12:15:40] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15silverwind opened pull request #1528: CSS: Don't add 'px' to '-ms-flex-order' (06master...06ms-flex-order) 02http://git.io/R4lS0w
[13:16:56] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: those are the moments where I really dislike that we're adding 'px' automatically anywhere at all :-)
[13:38:10] <DaveMethvin> One day we will learn there is no such thing as "selective magic", only "magic"
[13:38:57] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: "sufficiently advanced technology" ;)
[13:39:17] <DaveMethvin> clearly the problem is that our technology isn't sufficiently advanced yet!
[13:39:56] <DaveMethvin> maybe we should get the current value and see if it says some unit, and if not we should autopopulate the cssNumber object
[13:40:12] <DaveMethvin> accounting, of course, for all the special cases like "number", "bold", "inherit", etc
[13:40:17] <DaveMethvin> but that should be easy
[13:40:19] <DaveMethvin> HAHAHAHAHA
[13:40:21] <m_gol> though that will slow the setter a bit
[13:40:50] <m_gol> we can do an AJAX request to all relevant CSS spec docs, parse it and auto-populate cssNumber :P
[13:41:06] <m_gol> :devil thoughts:
[13:41:07] <DaveMethvin> now you're thinking m_gol 
[13:41:31] <m_gol> could we deprecate this 'px'-appending? even if that meant we cannot remove it before 2.20?
[13:42:13] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we could deprecate it, as doge would say so much break
[13:42:29] <m_gol> yeah, heh
[13:42:36] <m_gol> seems like sth that would be used a lot
[13:42:44] <m_gol> I'm sure my apps rely on it :->
[13:42:59] <DaveMethvin> and i'm sure it started as a "sure we can auto-append px"
[13:43:08] <DaveMethvin> what could possibly go wrong?
[13:43:54] <gibson042> ironically, it can be worked around by passing in true CSS numbers as strings :)
[13:45:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was just thinking about the whole issue of auto conversion from string to number because of http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14792
[13:46:12] <DaveMethvin> it's really bad practice to auto-convert from string to number, but everyone does that in order to use browser CSS properties
[13:46:26] <DaveMethvin> since they're always supposed to come back strings
[13:46:57] <gibson042> I'm still really curious about things like http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14792
[13:47:15] <gibson042> what, other than developer sensibilities, breaks when we return `400` instead of `"400"`?
[13:47:20] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: "supposed" is the right word :-)
[13:47:28] <DaveMethvin> good question
[13:47:50] <DaveMethvin> it's just a case of returning the exceptions as strings and not numbers but you have to wonder
[13:47:58] <DaveMethvin> and there is no way we're going to convert "bold"
[13:48:22] <gibson042> right
[13:48:31] <DaveMethvin> obtw gibson042 did you want to land your big squishy pull?
[13:48:32] <gibson042> define a cssHook if it matters that much for your application
[13:48:48] <DaveMethvin> i have about 6 or 7 that i will be landing soon but wanted you to get yours in
[13:48:52] <gibson042> depends; did I sell everyone on the minification comments?
[13:49:18] <m_gol> "jQuery developers hate him. A man discovers one weird trick to automatically add 'px' to CSS values"
[13:49:22] <DaveMethvin> i'm okay with it, if it turns out they degrade over time we'll have to figure out whether it's worth the extra review
[13:49:28] <DaveMethvin> lol m_gol 
[13:49:40] <gibson042> ok, I'll land it now
[13:49:46] <DaveMethvin> but the gains are pretty nice
[13:49:59] <gibson042> yeah
[13:50:13] <DaveMethvin> i do think that isNumeric one is worth fixing, and simple
[13:50:29] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea how he's running into that though
[13:50:49] <gibson042> I'm against it, but don't care a whole lot
[13:51:08] <DaveMethvin> isNumeric, yet another example of why not to expose utility functions
[13:51:36] <m_gol> that's how it ends when lib authors are too nice to users :)
[13:52:00] <DaveMethvin> "jQuery is supposed to solve all my problems, why can't you guys just do that?"
[13:52:22] <m_gol> and then "why is jQuery so large?" ;)

[14:57:12] <george> Hello there, anyone here?
[14:57:25] <m_gol> I think the day we drop the 1.x line we should also deprecate all our helper methods that we unfortunately exposed
[14:58:22] <george> Oops, seems like I got in the middle of a discussion, sorry
[15:02:25] <george> I don't mean to spam you guys, but I'm trying to get involved with the development of jquery, can someone give me a lead?
[15:05:10] <DaveMethvin> hi george, have you seen the info at http://contribute.jquery.org?
[15:05:21] <DaveMethvin> you're here, so that's a start :)
[15:05:54] <george> Hello dave, I have read the links on that page and signed the CLA already :)
[15:06:00] <DaveMethvin> great!
[15:06:18] <DaveMethvin> one good way to start is to monitor the bug reports and see what problems are reported
[15:06:31] <DaveMethvin> also, we always need help on documentation
[15:06:45] <m_gol> the "always" should be made bold :-)
[15:06:50] <DaveMethvin> haha
[15:08:11] <DaveMethvin> i have to run ... getting started can be the hardest part george but if you just idle here and keep track of new bugs on bugs.jquery.com or api.jquery.com you will be off to a good start
[15:08:32] <george> Ok!
[15:08:35] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues?state=open
[15:08:36] <george> thanks :)
[15:08:57] <m_gol> george: I started with one data bug a couple of months ago that broke our app; I reported a bug and then a PR, I started looking into the code & at the issues and that's how I got involved :)
[15:10:06] <george> Oh nice! Can you please give me a little more info on how to take action? It's the first time I'm trying get involved in a big project ... :)
[15:13:34] <m_gol> george: well, as DaveMethvin said, if you don't just hit an issue yourself, you can monitor open ones, experiment with jQuery code base locally and see if you can understand what's causing the problem and maybe propose a fix
[15:14:12] <m_gol> george: but if sth overwhelmed you, sometimes working with the api docs can deepen the understanding of what's really going on so it might be an easier start
