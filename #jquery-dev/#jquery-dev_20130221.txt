[04:19:24] <Krinkle> rwaldron: jquery-git isn't updating, http://www.youbrokethebuild ;-)
[05:37:05] <scott_gonzalez> If you take jquery.min.js which has the sourceMappingURL and you concatenate it with other files, what happens?
[05:37:13] <scott_gonzalez> a) Is the sourceMappingURL still recognized?
[05:37:31] <scott_gonzalez> b) Is the browser able to handle the additional code in the file?

[07:02:53] <Gho5t> scott_gonzalez: around?
[07:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:03:05] <Gho5t> morning
[07:03:09] <Gho5t> so I was able to get those tests running
[07:03:21] <Gho5t> it turns out I set my alias in apache to be for the "tests" directory
[07:03:28] <Gho5t> when I should have set it to the root jquery directory
[07:03:45] <Gho5t> since some of the files, like sizzle, need to be accessible
[07:03:45] <rwaldron> Gho5t that'll do it
[07:03:50] <rwaldron> nice job getting set up :)
[07:03:54] <Gho5t> thanks!
[07:04:01] <Gho5t> so I'm ready for the next part then
[07:04:09] <scott_gonzalez> Gho5t: So after all of that, what (if anything) wasn't documented?
[07:04:14] <rwaldron> the exciting part!
[07:04:23] <rwaldron> read bugs
[07:04:24] <Gho5t> well what I just mentioned surely wasn't
[07:04:36] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #696: STILL FAILING in 7 min 10 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/696/
[07:04:36] <Gho5t> thinking
[07:04:37] <doesallmagic> waldron.rick: Adds module to jshintrc
[07:04:43] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez I believe the tips guide I wrote does say that
[07:04:48] <rwaldron> but not sure if readme does
[07:05:00] <Gho5t> I think that's it
[07:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> Can you file an issue at https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/new and just add stuff to it as your remember?
[07:05:13] <Gho5t> scott_gonzalez: me?
[07:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Oh, where's that?
[07:05:33] <rwaldron> the link Gho5t posted yesterday
[07:05:37] <rwaldron> I wrote that
[07:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> Gho5t: Yeah, you're the one who had to struggle through it, so whatever wasn't super obvious should be listed?
[07:05:49] <rwaldron> but check it... the readme _does_ _not_
[07:05:49] <Gho5t> ok
[07:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the docs.jquery one?
[07:06:01] <rwaldron> Gho5t can you update this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery#running-the-unit-tests
[07:06:11] <rwaldron> (this section)
[07:06:16] <Gho5t> sure
[07:06:24] <Gho5t> how
[07:06:28] <rwaldron> to include a bold message: "must be run from root"
[07:06:35] <rwaldron> edit the readme file locally
[07:06:43] <rwaldron> (on a git branch)
[07:06:44] <scott_gonzalez> (in a branch)
[07:06:46] <Gho5t> ok hey this will be my first check in
[07:06:50] <Gho5t> ok I have a branch
[07:06:53] <Gho5t> 1 sec
[07:06:53] <rwaldron> let me start from beginning
[07:07:02] <Gho5t> ok
[07:07:09] <rwaldron> got your branch?
[07:07:26] <Gho5t> I created one yesterday but I don't see it
[07:07:28] <Gho5t> sorry new to git
[07:07:31] <Gho5t> I have Git open
[07:07:34] <Gho5t> and the jquery repo open
[07:08:04] <rwaldron> Gho5t ok
[07:08:09] <Gho5t> shouldn't the branch be in a separate folder in the root jQuery folder
[07:08:12] <rwaldron> at the command line, type: git branch
[07:08:17] <rwaldron> it will give you a list of branches
[07:08:35] <Gho5t> ok
[07:08:38] <Gho5t> Branch1 is in there
[07:08:40] <rwaldron> the one you're on will be starred (I think? I have it displayed in my command line path)
[07:08:43] <rwaldron> great!
[07:08:53] <Gho5t> yes it's starred
[07:08:59] <rwaldron> now open the readme in your editor
[07:09:03] <rwaldron> readme.md
[07:09:24] <rwaldron> and then go to that section and add a description about running the webserver from root of repo
[07:09:30] <rwaldron> save file
[07:09:35] <rwaldron> back to command
[07:09:40] <rwaldron> git add readme.md
[07:10:02] <rwaldron> git commit -m "Updated readme to have more info"
[07:10:14] <rwaldron> (you should make the message better then that)
[07:10:16] <rwaldron> :D
[07:10:26] <rwaldron> git push origin master
[07:10:31] <rwaldron> ack
[07:10:32] <rwaldron> no
[07:10:35] <rwaldron> sorry
[07:10:43] <rwaldron> git push orgin Branch1
[07:10:52] * rwaldron facepalm at self
[07:11:25] <rwaldron> now go to your fork on github and there will be a "Pull Request" button for this new branch
[07:11:28] <rwaldron> press it!
[07:11:45] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez can you help with any other q's? I have to run to the bodega to get some milk
[07:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[07:12:01] <rwaldron> thanks
[07:12:04] <rwaldron> btw
[07:12:04] <rwaldron> jinx
[07:12:16] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:12:54] <Gho5t> ok 
[07:12:55] <Gho5t> Run the unit tests with a local server that supports PHP. Ensure that you run the site from the root directory, not the "tests" directory.  No database is required. Pre-configured php local servers are available for Windows and Mac. Here are some options:
[07:12:57] <Gho5t> how's that sound
[07:13:15] <rwaldron> brilliant
[07:14:28] <rwaldron> before I go...
[07:14:35] <rwaldron> gibson042 ping
[07:14:55] <rwaldron> gibson042 I need that qsa option!! (stepping out for minute)
[07:15:32] <Gho5t> ok checking in now
[07:17:12] <Gho5t> crap
[07:17:17] <Gho5t> seems I need to update my email address
[07:17:53] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know how to do that?
[07:18:48] <Gho5t> yeah sorry
[07:18:52] <Gho5t> it said in there how to
[07:18:56] <Gho5t> ok after comming I'm getting
[07:19:10] <Gho5t> "no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
[07:19:14] <Gho5t> I already did add it
[07:19:27] <Gho5t> git add readme.md
[07:19:38] <Gho5t> git commit -m "Updated readme file"
[07:19:53] <scott_gonzalez> What does `git status` show?
[07:20:20] <Gho5t> same error
[07:20:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, `git status` doesn't show errors.
[07:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> You mean it says "nothing to commit"
[07:21:49] <Gho5t> yeah
[07:21:51] <Gho5t> 1 sec
[07:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> Does it say "Your branch is ahead..." ?
[07:22:48] <Gho5t> http://imgur.com/Ic0cVsv
[07:23:29] <scott_gonzalez> `git add README.md`
[07:24:44] <Gho5t> wow
[07:24:47] <Gho5t> case sensitive aye
[07:25:39] <Gho5t> ok my first commit
[07:25:40] <Gho5t> sweet
[07:26:11] <Gho5t> so when I pick up bugs did I read right that I should create a new branch for each?
[07:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:26:24] <scott_gonzalez> Pull requests are based on branches.
[07:26:34] <scott_gonzalez> And you never want to work in your master branch.
[07:26:42] <Gho5t> ok
[07:26:43] <scott_gonzalez> If you do, it will diverge from upstream master.
[07:26:56] <Gho5t> so do I need to do a pull request now?
[07:27:00] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:27:11] <Gho5t> ok can you walk me through that
[07:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> `git push origin Branch1`
[07:28:40] <Gho5t> I wish I would have named me branch a little better
[07:28:46] <Gho5t> so what would my next step be?
[07:28:50] <Gho5t> as far as finding bugs
[07:29:05] <scott_gonzalez> Well, first you need to send the pull request.
[07:29:14] <Gho5t> yep I just did
[07:29:47] <scott_gonzalez> No you didn't. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pulls/
[07:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> You need to go to your fork on GitHub.
[07:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> It should say that you just pushed to a new branch and there should be a button to send a pull request.
[07:31:23] <rwaldron> so... my car was tossed last night
[07:31:28] <Gho5t> ok I typed the command you said
[07:31:32] <Gho5t> now I go to https://github.com/ksieburg/jquery/branches
[07:31:38] <Gho5t> right?
[07:31:48] <Gho5t> and then click "Pull Requests"
[07:32:06] <Gho5t> ok
[07:32:07] <Gho5t> https://github.com/ksieburg/jquery/tree/Branch1
[07:32:18] <Gho5t> done
[07:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to sign the CLA http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/
[07:34:02] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: What happened?
[07:34:20] <Gho5t> mailing address huh
[07:34:33] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez I left my car door unlocked in Bed/Stuy ;)
[07:34:44] <Gho5t> brooklyn?
[07:34:49] <rwaldron> Gho5t yessor
[07:34:54] <rwaldron> ack
[07:34:55] <Gho5t> whoops
[07:34:55] <rwaldron> yessier
[07:34:58] <rwaldron> oh man
[07:35:00] <Gho5t> sorry to hear that
[07:35:02] <rwaldron> I can't type at all today
[07:35:04] <rwaldron> no worries
[07:35:06] <Gho5t> they steal it?
[07:35:09] <rwaldron> nope
[07:35:09] <Gho5t> or just poop in it
[07:35:12] <rwaldron> hahaha
[07:35:13] <rwaldron> no
[07:35:19] <rwaldron> wait... what??
[07:35:31] <Gho5t> I've seen vids on the net
[07:35:37] <rwaldron> all they did was take everything out of the glove box and make a mess
[07:35:44] <rwaldron> my car is boring
[07:35:48] <rwaldron> and so are the things in it
[07:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: At least they didn't steal your stereo or battery.
[07:36:11] <Gho5t> scott_gonzalez: done
[07:36:30] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez the stereo is one of those factory jobs that's mounted/glued etc
[07:36:35] <scott_gonzalez> Sometimes they'll find cars that are always parked in the same place and steal the battery and throw it out.
[07:36:41] <rwaldron> the battery is actually in the trunk
[07:36:42] <scott_gonzalez> Then they'll come back in a few days and steal the new battery.
[07:36:51] <rwaldron> so they might've given up before they found it
[07:36:55] <rwaldron> but they WOULD suck
[07:36:57] <rwaldron> that*
[07:37:13] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez that's a genious scam
[07:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:37:47] <Gho5t> lot of work for $100 though
[07:37:54] <Gho5t> maybe not
[07:37:59] <Gho5t> scott_gonzalez: what's next?
[07:38:07] <scott_gonzalez> Gho5t: Find some bugs and fix 'em :-)
[07:38:11] <rwaldron> I once dated a girl that had her honda accord's distributor cap stolen
[07:38:15] <Gho5t> ok where is the bug tracker
[07:38:19] <rwaldron> but that actually makes sense to me
[07:38:22] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/
[07:38:24] <Gho5t> yeah
[07:38:37] <rwaldron> honda accord and civic are the most common cars of all cars of all tie
[07:38:41] <Gho5t> ok I've looked in here before
[07:38:42] <rwaldron> time*
[07:38:57] <Gho5t> so I click on View Tickets -> Open bugs by component right
[07:39:08] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[07:39:09] <Gho5t> and then just pick any that are open?
[07:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:39:24] <Gho5t> any with a status of "open" rather
[07:39:33] <Gho5t> ok
[07:39:39] <Gho5t> and if I need help fixing it, do I come here?
[07:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like GitHub's contribution calendar has a bug: https://github.com/ksieburg
[07:40:21] <scott_gonzalez> Current streak should be 1 day.
[07:40:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, though you'll be at the mercy of the availability of others :-)
[07:40:51] <Gho5t> ah
[07:40:58] <Gho5t> right : )
[07:41:01] <Gho5t> give me your cell
[07:41:03] <Gho5t> haha jk
[07:41:08] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez where is that documented?
[07:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> The contribution calendar?
[07:41:30] <rwaldron> yeah
[07:42:08] <scott_gonzalez> This is all I've seen: https://help.github.com/articles/why-are-my-contributions-not-showing-up-on-my-profile
[07:42:35] <rwaldron> thanks
[07:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> Basically it's issues, PRs and commits to master on the main branch of an original repo
[07:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> So not a fork, not a branch.
[07:43:04] <rwaldron> sometimes I wish I could get more of the things I want to read about and less of the things I dont want to read about... in a convenient location
[07:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> And the repo needs at least 1 star.
[07:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: If you can solve that problem, you'd make a lot of people very happy.
[07:43:52] <scott_gonzalez> I've stopped using my feed reader.
[07:43:56] <scott_gonzalez> Too much noise.
[07:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> I figure I'll eventually hear about the important stuff somehow.
[07:44:42] <gibson042> rwaldron yt?
[07:46:00] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez speakign of which, I just added a few of these to my google reader: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Project:Feeds
[07:46:04] <rwaldron> kind of awesome :)
[07:46:09] <rwaldron> gibson042 I am
[07:46:37] <gibson042> and you're looking for the no-Sizzle build?
[07:47:36] <rwaldron> gibson042 I am
[07:48:03] <gibson042> I think it'll be ready today or tomorrow
[07:51:04] <rwaldron> gibson042 brilliant
[07:51:18] <gibson042> what's your purpose?
[07:51:38] <rwaldron> b2g/gaia/FirefoxOS apps
[07:51:53] <rwaldron> Q: Will there be getElementById fast path?
[07:53:03] <gibson042> I hadn't planned on it
[07:53:12] <rwaldron> eg. selector[0] === # ? [ gEBI(selector.slice(1)) ] : qSA
[07:53:18] <rwaldron> oh hm ok
[07:53:31] <gibson042> basically just the thinnest of wrappers around jQuery.find = DOMNode.querySelectorAll
[07:53:44] <rwaldron> hm
[07:53:46] <rwaldron> ok
[07:54:36] <rwaldron> I wonder if we should consider, at very least, having the fast path for ID
[07:54:45] <rwaldron> it's a considerable performance boost
[07:55:10] <gibson042> actually, we don't need to
[07:55:17] <gibson042> that one's already in jQuery.fn.init
[07:55:17] <rwaldron> oh?
[07:55:30] <rwaldron> for some reason I thought we removed it
[07:55:40] <gibson042> doesn't look like it
[07:55:46] <rwaldron> but of course, I didnt look before mentioning it just now
[07:55:48] <rwaldron> duh
[07:55:49] <gibson042> ;)
[07:56:01] <rwaldron> I thought timmywil had wanted to get rid of it some time ago
[07:56:12] <rwaldron> to put all of the selection in Sizzle
[07:56:15] <rwaldron> great!
[07:56:15] <gibson042> I think he was talked out of it
[07:56:20] <gibson042> (for performance)
[07:56:21] <rwaldron> yeah
[07:56:24] <rwaldron> never did it
[07:56:28] <rwaldron> got it
[07:56:31] <rwaldron> thanks
[07:56:40] <gibson042> np
[07:56:42] <rwaldron> that's basically the same as fulfilling the feature request
[07:56:43] <rwaldron> <3

[08:37:42] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez what email should we use for the official jquery npm user account?
[08:37:58] <scott_gonzalez> hmm... npm@jquery.com?
[08:38:00] <rwaldron> isaacs just made us the owner of both jquery and jQuery

[09:31:36] <DaveMethvin> hi guys! yes i'm at w3conf scott_gonzalez
[09:31:52] <DaveMethvin> they have a camera focused on me so i'm trying not to pick my nose
[09:32:46] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron i tend to agree with you on the Android issue ... but ugh that is going to be a shitstorm
[09:33:13] <DaveMethvin> if you go back to my last jqcon slides though i did say, "not just mobile...MODERN"
[09:33:23] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery 2.0: Works in Canary and maybe some other browsers.
[09:33:34] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:33:41] <scott_gonzalez> YMMV
[09:34:33] <DaveMethvin> this just points out that the webkit clan is now our worst case scenario though, it's no longer oldIE holding us back
[09:34:52] <DaveMethvin> nothing stops someone from using 1.9 there tho
[09:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> oldWebKit
[09:35:10] <snover> aka mobile safari
[09:35:13] <DaveMethvin> oldcantbeupdatedwebkit
[09:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> I think we just want to change the messaging to: Use jQuery 2.0 where you know the full range of browsers/devices.
[09:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> Use 1.9 in all other cases.
[09:36:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i have been edging that direction
[09:36:12] <DaveMethvin> use 2.0 for non-web situations, mostly
[09:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> Does kangax have a support table that we can point people to?
[09:36:21] <scott_gonzalez> OR THE WEB PLATFORM DOCS!
[09:36:52] <DaveMethvin> there's definitey a lack of support info that crosses both desktop and mobile
[09:36:56] <scott_gonzalez> Or even for internal sites where you have control over what browsers are used.
[09:37:01] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:37:13] <snover> saywhatnow
[09:37:44] <DaveMethvin> what you confused about snover
[09:37:45] <snover> that makes it sound like the 2.0 branch is some sort of failure
[09:38:23] <DaveMethvin> it's just not the mainstream version for web sites until the older browsers die
[09:38:38] <DaveMethvin> but there are lots of non-browser situations where it's great
[09:39:18] <DaveMethvin> chome plugins, firefox plugins, node.js, windows 8 apps, probably a lot of phonegap/cordova stuff
[09:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, snover, what browser support are you aiming for in Dojo 2?
[09:40:52] <snover> ie9+, ios 6+, android 4.2+
[09:41:10] <snover> latest ff, chrome, opera
[09:41:33] <snover> safari 6+ i guesssss
[09:41:56] <DaveMethvin> what runs safari 5.1?
[09:42:04] <DaveMethvin> older iphone?
[09:42:15] <snover> that, and people that hate apple maps so refuse to upgrade
[09:42:27] <DaveMethvin> oh
[09:42:36] <snover> actually
[09:42:42] <snover> there is no iphone that runs ios 5 that does not run ios 4
[09:42:46] <snover> according to wikipedia
[09:42:48] <snover> er
[09:42:50] <snover> that does not run ios 6
[09:42:59] <snover> the 3G is stuck at 4.2.1
[09:43:13] <snover> 3GS can run 6.1.2
[09:43:13] <DaveMethvin> i'm more mad at android right now
[09:43:20] * DaveMethvin shakes fist
[09:43:31] <snover> as you should be, but it’s chrome now
[09:43:43] <snover> as long as you can ignore the 25% that are on a dead end road using android 2.3
[09:43:54] <DaveMethvin> that was me until 4 months ago
[09:44:03] <DaveMethvin> but i got out and walked
[09:44:38] <DaveMethvin> ignoring them probably is the right path, but we'll need to tweak the messaging
[09:44:49] <DaveMethvin> damn i sound like some marketing guy
[09:44:58] <DaveMethvin> "we'll need to adjust the optics"
[09:47:06] <DaveMethvin> mkay got to reload coffee, watch for me on the live feed
[09:47:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's just a spinny conf icon right now.
[12:25:23] <rwaldron> Krinkle there is a "timo" in #b2g on irc.mozilla.org and I keep wanting it to be you
[12:25:35] <Krinkle> Nope, not me.
[12:25:41] <rwaldron> I know!
[12:25:44] <rwaldron> I wish it was
[12:25:53] * rwaldron grumbles...
[12:30:56] <Krinkle> rwaldron: He's on a dutch server
[12:31:02] <rwaldron> bwagahahahahahaha
[12:31:03] <rwaldron> <3
[12:31:12] <Krinkle> Nickname:	timo
[12:31:12] <Krinkle> Username:	timo
[12:31:12] <Krinkle> Server:	gravel.mozilla.org
[12:31:14] <Krinkle> Server info:	Amsterdam, Netherlands
[12:32:17] <Krinkle> rwaldron: btw, do you know about Smoigel?
[12:32:34] <rwaldron> Krinkle from LOTR?
[12:32:34] <Krinkle> I'm currently tired and writing some code peotry
[12:32:51] <Krinkle> rwaldron: Not smigel
[12:32:54] <rwaldron> ;)
[12:33:00] <Krinkle> From friday night dinner
[12:33:16] <Krinkle> Transcribing a funny scene from that show in code.
[12:36:11] <Stilo> how i can drop an element into a box and keep the image there without showing any alert.
[12:36:45] <Krinkle> Stilo: 'visibility: hidden;' in CSS?>
[13:18:26] <Krinkle> rwaldron: thx
[16:47:17] <rwaldron> gibson042 ping
[16:47:25] <rwaldron> i'm not sure I understand what timmywil is saying
[16:47:56] <rwaldron> at first I thought he was in support of letting jQuery 2.0 be the progressive dev's library and 1.9.x for everyone else
[16:48:08] <rwaldron> but then it sort of swings away at the end?
[16:48:13] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13494#comment:5
[17:03:27] <gibson042> rwaldron I'm pretty sure it's saying ES5 incompatibility means use 1.x
[17:04:51] <gibson042> but I'm saying case-by-case to cast a wide net for the "close enough" environments
[17:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell jaubourg My reply on trac quotes your reply, but is not directly specifically at you :-)
[17:07:17] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I’ll tell jaubourg about that.
[17:07:44] <rwaldron> gibson042 that's what i figured
[17:08:03] <rwaldron> goddamnit... you've both blitzed me.
[17:08:13] <gibson042> lol
[17:08:32] <gibson042> you're the #1 victim for that, by far
[17:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> definitely
[17:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> Time to go build some more walls...
[17:09:15] <rwaldron> whoever decided that trac made post ids (or whatever the problem is) before the actual POST occurs... is a jerk.
[17:09:47] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez my post essentially says the same as yours but  have a bit of summary
[17:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[17:10:05] <rwaldron> and need to refute jaubourh's insane concept of what an implementation is responsible for
[17:10:25] * scott_gonzalez actually heads to the basement to build walls now
[17:10:40] <rwaldron> nice
[17:10:44] <rwaldron> that sounds super fun
[17:12:05] <gibson042> rwaldron: I've also been thinking about our backout of the push.apply(_, NodeList) calls in jQuery 2.0
[17:12:17] <gibson042> we *could* shim core_push like I just did in https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/commit/b56589f114ad6d8a267bbb75dbb001c3d4fa18f2
[17:12:17] <b-ot> gibson042: Richard Gibson (3d 9h ago): Followup e15dd8e1: Combine slice and push shims for better oldIE performance
[17:12:51] <gibson042> and defineProperty as well, for that matter
[17:14:31] <rwaldron> gibson042 as in Object.defineProperty = Object.defineProperty || function( target, property, descriptor ) { return (target[property] = descriptor.value ...blah blah blah figure out how to do [[Get]]) }
[17:15:07] <gibson042> more or less
[17:15:12] <gibson042> well, definitely less
[17:15:27] <gibson042> because we just need the valueOf override to work
[17:15:44] <rwaldron> hm
[17:16:15] <rwaldron> so the Object.defineProperties use is mostly to keep the object's expected shape in-tact
[17:16:42] <rwaldron> it's not likely that Android Browser will have too many people inspecting objects
[17:16:42] <gibson042> right
[17:16:50] <gibson042> especially DOM nodes
[17:17:16] <rwaldron> this could work
[17:17:20] <rwaldron> reasonable
[17:17:25] <rwaldron> y
[17:17:29] <rwaldron> whatever ;)
[17:17:57] <rwaldron> and Sizzle _does_ have a precedent for us to follow
[17:18:11] <gibson042> it's just nice graceful degradation... we work with ES5 APIs, and shim those that just barely fail
[17:18:18] <rwaldron> I'm in.
[17:18:23] <rwaldron> rules?
[17:18:41] <rwaldron> 1. the shim is bound to the IIFE scope
[17:18:53] <rwaldron> none of this: jQuery.defineProperties
[17:18:59] <gibson042> +9001
[17:19:11] <rwaldron> 2. it's defined in data for now
[17:19:17] <gibson042> yep
[17:19:29] <rwaldron> i can't think of anything else...
[17:19:50] <rwaldron> hm
[17:19:51] <gibson042> 3. environments that are fully functional use native code
[17:19:52] <rwaldron> dude
[17:19:57] <rwaldron> does this work...
[17:20:17] <rwaldron> var define = Object.defineProperties || jQuery.extend
[17:20:28] <rwaldron> (this, descriptor)
[17:20:39] <rwaldron> target, objectOfProperties
[17:20:47] <rwaldron> 0_0
[17:20:54] <gibson042> I'm thinking absolutely
[17:21:11] <rwaldron> because we're betting on the DEFAULTS for descriptor
[17:21:29] <rwaldron> writable: false, configurable: false, enumerable: false
[17:21:41] <rwaldron> wanna do it up?
[17:21:41] <rwaldron> i have to go to dinner
[17:21:44] <rwaldron> I'm getting yelled at
[17:21:53] <rwaldron> I mean... beckoned
[17:21:54] <rwaldron> ;)
[17:21:56] <gibson042> :)
[17:22:07] <gibson042> no can do right now, but this can be committed by tomorrow for sure
[17:22:15] <rwaldron> rad
[17:22:30] <rwaldron> make sure you include explanation from this discussion
[17:22:31] <rwaldron> :D
[17:39:08] <rwaldron> gibson042 you'll need to do a support test
[17:39:30] <rwaldron> since you only want to acccount for the "define on dom node" case
[17:39:34] <rwaldron> anyway, ttyl
[20:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Yeah, it's fun. Sometimes tedious, but always a sense of accomplishment after any type of construction work.
[20:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> I got ~200 sq. ft. of drywall up tonight.
