[13:52:55] <nacin> I have a philosophical question for y'all. Should the next version of WordPress ship jQuery Migrate? As you probably know our version of jQuery is noConflict for historical reasons. Should we attach migrate onto core just the same?
[13:53:54] <DaveMethvin> nacin i guess it depends on how many wordpress plugins etc still might need migrate
[13:54:15] <nacin> DaveMethvin: we're operating on the assumption that many, many of them will.
[13:54:35] <DaveMethvin> always the dilemma that as long as the crutch is there, they will lean on it
[13:54:41] <DaveMethvin> but when you take it away they fall over
[13:54:45] <DaveMethvin> which is usually worse
[13:55:14] <nacin> for us it especially is worse. our worst upgrades are always the JS errors that prevent users from doing anything.
[13:55:26] <DaveMethvin> i'd keep it around for the rest of the year
[13:55:34] <DaveMethvin> and make scary noises about it going away
[13:55:46] <DaveMethvin> dunno if you have a way to motivate people to upgrate
[13:55:48] <DaveMethvin> de
[13:55:48] <nacin> Well, I guess I'm asking: Is it unreasonable to ship migrate in production for the long-term?
[13:56:11] <kswedberg> another philosophical question would be whether to use the version of migrate that spits out all the warnings or not.
[13:56:14] <DaveMethvin> i think we'll be trying to keep it updated for a while
[13:56:29] <DaveMethvin> i'd say yes to that one kswedberg
[13:56:41] <DaveMethvin> that would hopefully encourage ppl to upgrade
[13:56:55] <nacin> we have a developer mode that would trigger those, yes.
[13:57:16] <nacin> would the plan be to continue to move deprecated functionality into migrate over time, or was this a one-time 1.8-to-1.9 thing?
[13:57:37] <DaveMethvin> i think we'll be trying to keep it up to date for 1.10 
[13:58:18] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: true. I haven't looked at the migrate code, but does it assume the browser has window.console or does it check for it?
[13:58:18] <DaveMethvin> the challenge for us is to have a single plugin that tries to keep all code from jQuery 1.0 to 1.9 from breaking during upgrades
[13:58:25] <DaveMethvin> it checks
[13:58:32] <kswedberg> ah. good.
[13:59:02] <nacin> migrate doesn't cover back to 1.0?
[13:59:07] <DaveMethvin> no
[13:59:12] <DaveMethvin> only from 1.6
[13:59:24] <DaveMethvin> our apis change a bunch before 1.6
[13:59:55] <nacin> what about 1.x after 1.10?
[14:00:36] <DaveMethvin> there shouldn't be any big breaking changes in 1.10
[14:01:02] <nacin> PHP upstream has made us look like idiots more times than I can count. I am just trying to make sure we are on the same page.
[14:01:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that's good, we should talk more :)
[14:01:46] <DaveMethvin> i think it does make sense to continue having Migrate there for at least another 6 months
[14:02:13] <DaveMethvin> give people a chance to upgrade everything
[14:02:24] <DaveMethvin> the problem is going to be the abandoned plugins
[14:02:47] <DaveMethvin> we still get people asking for help on code written in 2007
[14:03:06] <nacin> you're preaching to the choir.
[14:03:45] <nacin> What we'd end up doing is stick it in there for 6 months (3.6), then take it out during the next release cycle (3.7), then probably have to add it back right before the release of 3.7. Warnings in 3.6, followed by a bigger stick during 3.7-dev, should move the needle quite a bit. So maybe a year from now we remove it.
[14:04:28] <DaveMethvin> so, stand out on the ledge and say you're gonna jump, then duck back into the window right before release. Got it.
[14:04:32] <DaveMethvin> :D
[14:05:06] <nacin> It actually works for us. We don't have much choice. It's less of the threat of jumping, and more of others actually going "oh, right, there's a guy on the ledge". They have no idea otherwise their code is broken. :-)
[14:05:44] <DaveMethvin> so true
[14:06:05] <nacin> Actually, while I am here, is there a timeline for 1.10? The 2.0 post said a few months. We'll be shipping 1.9 + migrate for the foreseeable future (because reasons).
[14:06:28] <DaveMethvin> 1.10 beta 1 should be out this week, hopefully tomorrow
[14:06:42] <DaveMethvin> not a lot of changes, but we figured people might want to see it
[14:06:53] <DaveMethvin> and it brings in some small fixes that sync up with 2.0
[14:06:58] <nacin> you guys normally have fairly quick beta-to-final, would that be the case here?
[14:07:04] <DaveMethvin> probably
[14:07:25] <nacin> I worry that plugin developers will clamor for 2.0, override ours, and break everything else.
[14:07:57] <DaveMethvin> i've worred bout that too, 2.0 isn't really ready for the web with so much old IE out there
[14:08:12] <DaveMethvin> but it helps us to get a running start on that fine day
[14:08:58] <nacin> We're probably under a month to final release. I may drop in 1.10 beta 1 into trunk, if 1.10 final comes out quickly enough, we may be able to run with it.
[14:09:32] <DaveMethvin> testing with the beta would be great, at minimum
[14:09:51] <DaveMethvin> we shoudl have final out in a couple of weeks unless people find big problems
[14:10:31] <DaveMethvin> we don't get a lot of beta action ... when 1.9 came out we found out that a major plugin for ASP.NET broke horribly
[14:10:38] <DaveMethvin> but nobody ever reported it in 6 months of beta
[14:11:48] <nacin> We frequently push your betas into our trunk, which goes to a few thousand sites or so.
[14:12:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's greatly appreciated
[14:12:24] <DaveMethvin> now if you could just push them into Microsoft sites ... :)
[14:13:06] <nacin> Sadly, my influence stops somewhere before that edge.
[14:13:13] <nacin> migrate does console.warn(), right?
[14:13:18] <DaveMethvin> yes
[14:13:41] <nacin> depending on the browser, regular users could actually see a count of those in a status bar, right?
[14:13:51] <DaveMethvin> yep
[14:16:04] <nacin> We wouldn't want regular users to see console.warn, but maybe we could swap that out for console.log. Alternative is suppressing it entirely when debug mode is off.
[14:16:30] <nacin> course, now we're filling up consoles in production, not sure how fair that is.
[14:16:53] <DaveMethvin> depends on whether you think that will help devs fix the issues :)
[14:17:43] <DaveMethvin> there are some variables you can set to control whether those get logged https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate#migrate-plugin-api
[14:18:36] <DaveMethvin> so you could set .migrateMute=true or .migrateTrace=false to reduce the output
[14:18:41] <nacin> right. I was only thinking about warn versus log.
[14:19:35] <DaveMethvin> log messages are just about invisible to people, kind of surprising how even some web devs don't seem to look at them
[14:20:45] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't help that IE only logs console messages if you have their dev tools open
[15:20:55] <mycomu> hello
[15:23:11] <mycomu> is ther any way to select one div inside the third <td>  in the second <tr> of my <table>
[15:25:56] <mycomu> I tested that $('#mytable tr:eq(2) td:eq(3) div').css('background-color','red')
[15:26:01] <mycomu> but no result

[18:26:10] <JamesMGreene> Are jQuery event handlers fired synchronously when the event is triggered?
[18:26:49] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene yes
[18:26:59] <JamesMGreene> k thx
[18:27:08] <JamesMGreene> Assumed so

[19:48:10] <Solineoz> Hi all, is there someone who know how to contact the administrator of the jQuery forum ??
[19:48:28] <DaveMethvin> Solineoz what do you need?
[19:49:54] <Solineoz> Report some issues with the forum
[19:50:19] <DaveMethvin> what kind of issues?
[19:51:16] <Solineoz> post deleted, can't follow threads, can't colorize text
[19:51:34] <DaveMethvin> do you have a link to a post that shows the problem?
[19:51:57] <Solineoz> yeah, wait a sec I'll connect
[19:53:34] <Solineoz> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/legacy-problem-jquery#14737000004112325
[19:53:42] <Solineoz> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-method-only-seems-to-work-once#14737000004112197
[19:53:58] <Solineoz> in those threads my answer was deleted
[19:55:08] <Solineoz> Win7 64-bits ultimate FR, firefox 20.0.1 and connecting using gmail account
[19:56:34] <DaveMethvin> Solineoz the forum log shows that you deleted those posts
[19:56:56] <Solineoz> No I didn't, I keep them for records
[19:57:51] <DaveMethvin> what plugins do you have installed in firefox? maybe one is clicking links on the page
[19:58:36] <DaveMethvin> i don't see any large number of self-deleted posts, only yours and they all happened within the last hour
[19:59:34] <Solineoz> Adobe Acrobat, Google Update, Java Platform, QuickTime, Shockwave Flash, Silverlight, Uplay Pc, Uplcay Pc hub, VLC
[20:00:29] <DaveMethvin> well looking at the log i don't see anything wrong with the forum, and it really sounds like something is clicking links on your behalf
[20:00:41] <DaveMethvin> those are plugins, do you have any add-ons?
[20:01:37] <DaveMethvin> click the firefox (orange) button and then Add-ons
[20:01:47] <Solineoz> only the activated/enabled one ??
[20:01:50] <DaveMethvin> any extensons?
[20:01:55] <Solineoz> yeah
[20:02:18] <Solineoz> BTW my native language and OS is french
[20:03:34] <DaveMethvin> do you want those posts restored? I can do it from the moderator panel
[20:03:35] <Solineoz> active: Downloadhelper, firebug, flash and video download, ghostery. irc client (install within 20 mins) and live reload
[20:03:52] <Solineoz> yeah it would be great
[20:04:00] <Solineoz> for me and others
[20:04:16] <Solineoz> Ok, would you suggest that I'll use chrome for the next week or so ??
[20:04:34] <DaveMethvin> or disable some of the add-ons to see if one of them may be causing problems
[20:05:55] <Solineoz> ok, and what about the follow links that don't work
[20:06:19] <DaveMethvin> which page was that on?
[20:06:26] <Solineoz> I even tried with chrome
[20:06:36] <Solineoz> I'll try one
[20:07:21] <Solineoz> I would say almost all
[20:07:23] <Solineoz> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/hello-world#14737000004112051
[20:09:32] <DaveMethvin> the reply by jakecigar? it has a space at the end of the URL
[20:11:17] <Solineoz> yeah
[20:11:33] <DaveMethvin> i don't know if it was typed in that way or somehow a space was added
[20:11:47] <Solineoz> even at the start
[20:13:30] <Solineoz> I looked back at the https://forum.jquery.com/topic/legacy-problem-jquery#14737000004112325 and my post was alredy deleted
[20:13:44] <Solineoz> I'll disconnect from the forum
[20:20:30] <DaveMethvin> Solineoz it is definitely strange, a LOT of your posts have been deleted but it says they were all deleted by you
[20:20:56] <DaveMethvin> and i don't see other people's posts deleted the same way
[20:22:07] <Solineoz> I retried chrome and I can follow and change the text color
[20:22:23] <Solineoz> Somethings wrong with my firefox
[20:22:35] <DaveMethvin> i would think it is one of the add-ons
[20:23:06] <DaveMethvin> it must be "clicking" the delete links when you visit the page :(
[20:23:09] <Solineoz> probably, or a combination of them
[20:23:21] <Solineoz> yeah what is strange
[20:23:47] <DaveMethvin> i think i have undeleted all the posts, you can check and see
[20:23:52] <DaveMethvin> don't use Firefox :)
[20:24:06] <Solineoz> yeah I won't
[20:26:41] <Solineoz> they seems to be there
[20:26:51] <DaveMethvin> ok great
[20:26:54] <Solineoz> I really appreciate your time
[20:27:01] <DaveMethvin> no problem, good luck
[20:27:02] <Solineoz> thank you very much
[21:40:29] <JamesMGreene> How do I kill merge commits again?  They don't show up in rebase (at least not be default)
