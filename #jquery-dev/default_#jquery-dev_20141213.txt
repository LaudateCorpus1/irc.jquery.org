[12:46:46] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[12:47:20] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[12:47:55] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: since we're already complaining about Safari 8/iOS 8... how about mentioning that we're unable to test iOS 8 in jQuery since the simulator reports an incorrect user agent?
[12:48:08] <m_gol> that's another issue that has been fixed but wasn't backported
[12:48:19] <m_gol> even thought the fix is a one-liner
[12:48:47] <m_gol> on the other hand, we could be testing on that if we didn't parse user agents ourselves ;)
[12:48:53] <m_gol> so Sizzle can do it, only jQuery can't
[12:49:06] <DaveMethvin> can you add a note to the blog post with suggested wording?
[12:49:35] <m_gol> k
[12:49:43] <DaveMethvin> awesome!
[12:56:27] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ok, added sth. Not sure if wording is best so change what you want
[12:56:39] <m_gol> (I added it as a suggestion)
[12:56:52] <DaveMethvin> sure, it's always easier for me if I can start with something, so that's great
