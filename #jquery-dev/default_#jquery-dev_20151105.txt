[13:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I can't seem to find the public preview link in blog.jquery.com.
[13:13:38] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it was just below the editor.
[13:13:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah it is, usually
[13:13:53] <DaveMethvin> maybe we don't have the plugin loaded?
[13:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, maybe it doesn't work with the new version of WordPress.
[13:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> Let me update the plugin and see if that helps.
[13:14:50] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...didn't seem to help.
[13:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, it's in the public section now, in the top right.
[13:19:09] <DaveMethvin> rearranging the furniture :)
[13:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> Can we get a tweet or retweet from @jquery? https://twitter.com/scott_gonzalez/status/662342392499056640

[13:57:24] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: yep, i can do it

[14:24:10] <m_gol> DaveMethvin timmywil gibson042 DaveMethvin: has anyone seen markelog recently?
[14:24:24] <DaveMethvin> not since the meeting
[14:24:38] <m_gol> I worry about the list for 1.12/2.2...
[14:24:49] <m_gol> we don't have a lot of time to release them
[14:24:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i have been working on other stuff but would like to start that
[14:26:18] <DaveMethvin> m_gol:  do we need to set up jenkins jobs for that?
[14:26:26] <m_gol> yup
[14:26:30] <m_gol> but we need branches first
[14:26:33] <m_gol> so I'm waiting for that
[14:26:41] <m_gol> I'll set it all up once we have the branches
[14:27:06] <m_gol> I've created the proper browserSets: jquery-1 & jquery-2
[14:27:21] <DaveMethvin> ok so it should be quick once we have the branches
[14:27:33] <DaveMethvin> just wondered if there were other things we could do
[14:27:36] <m_gol> yes, just cloning the job & tweaking a couple of settings, I can do it
[14:28:14] <m_gol> I guess we could rename the 2.1-stable branch to 2.2-stable, 1.11-stable to 1.12-stable
[14:28:18] <m_gol> and set it up on them
[14:28:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah that is probably where we will start
[14:28:35] <DaveMethvin> and you could see if the job actually works :)
[14:28:40] <m_gol> yep
[14:28:52] <m_gol> but I'd like to wait for timmywil before creating new branches & removing old ones :-)
[14:28:58] <m_gol> because that's what branch "renaming" really is
[14:29:14] <timmywil> sounds good to me
[14:29:18] <m_gol> k, great
[14:29:20] <DaveMethvin> right, same hash different name
[14:29:28] <m_gol> we'll also need to have the Periodic jobs set up
[14:29:39] <m_gol> which will mean 4 periodic jobs running now that we still have compat :-D
[14:29:52] <DaveMethvin> can we kill the compat one?
[14:29:52] <timmywil> Probably don't need to run jobs on compat anymore
[14:30:01] <m_gol> yeah, you're right

[14:32:23] <m_gol> I'll hold of with bumping the version in package.json to not make cherry-picking harder (since we haven't decided how much to cherry-pick yet)

[14:44:21] <m_gol> the build is going although we do have some red here & there... http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1639
[14:46:46] <DaveMethvin> not bad tho
[14:47:12] <DaveMethvin> gotta walk the dog
[15:03:16] <m_gol> this table is so long... http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1640
[15:16:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that table alone is a good reason to not have a jquery-compat! :)
[15:16:38] <DaveMethvin> the fails are real, but the chrome ones are the fractional offset issue we already fixed in the test
[15:17:04] <DaveMethvin> and the IE one is one of those cross-frame window issue, i think that was fixed in sizzle?
[15:17:17] <DaveMethvin> so it's holding up pretty well
[15:43:46] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: yeah, but we haven't backported anything yet so that was easy :P
[15:44:06] <DaveMethvin> haven't you ever heard of bit rot? :)
[15:44:48] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: but yeah, jQuery 2 doesn't build on Node >=4, that's bad
[15:44:59] <m_gol> it also doesn't build with npm@3 (same for jQuery 1)
[15:45:08] <m_gol> so we'll have to do some build updates before releasing
[15:45:22] <m_gol> I'd do it even now but we need to decide what we do with these branches first
[15:45:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah, definitely ... it's a bit sad that JS build tools move so quickly that you can't rebuild a project after a year
[15:46:06] <DaveMethvin> I've successfully rebuilt C programs that were more than a decade old
[15:46:45] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I think we need to have a build task that does no linters, no tests etc.
[15:46:53] <m_gol> this just increases the error surface
[15:46:55] <m_gol> also, no native deps
[15:47:03] <m_gol> that's why `npm install` fails on jQuery 2 currently
[15:47:16] <m_gol> because of jsdom which depends on a broken contextify version
[15:47:52] <m_gol> we fixed that issue on master by updating jsdom and not installing the old one automatically
[15:48:29] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: so, I have ideas on how to make it less vulnerable to future changes as you see but we really need to decide on sth first :D
[15:48:48] <m_gol> jQuery Core 2 Periodic: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1641
[15:49:12] <m_gol> jQuery Core Compat Periodic disabled
[15:51:14] <m_gol> jQuery Core 1 Periodic: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1642
[15:51:22] <m_gol> all jobs set up
[15:51:27] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[15:51:37] <DaveMethvin> now we just need to start picking
[15:51:40] <DaveMethvin> gimme that list
[15:51:52] <m_gol> "just", a famous last word :-)
[15:51:57] <DaveMethvin> right
[15:52:41] <DaveMethvin> especially since ie6 and ie7 are involved
[15:53:42] <DaveMethvin> did we determine that the current sizzle will be fine for this, or do we need to use something older and cherry pick it too?
[15:59:21] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: gibson042 said the latest Sizzle should be fine
[15:59:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah i thought that might be the case...good
[16:04:05] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: did you think what do to about the compat branch?
[16:04:41] <m_gol> I don't like an idea of removing a branch that has some unique commits so I thought maybe we could rename it to compat-archived once we're done with 1.12/2.2
[16:06:33] <m_gol> Or archived/compat so that some GUI clients are able to collapse it. :P
[16:38:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah that sounds like a good idea to me for now, let's check with timmywil
