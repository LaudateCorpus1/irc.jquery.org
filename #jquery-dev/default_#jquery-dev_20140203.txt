[09:14:40] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core build #1074: SUCCESS in 5 min 9 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/1074/
[15:22:52] <Krinkle> rwaldron: Hi, what about http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2474
[15:23:07] <rwaldron> I was just curious about the errors 
[15:28:08] <Krinkle> Two timed out without any useful message. Looks like a browser crash, or loose VM connection. I'll let testswarm re-create and re-run those.
[15:28:29] <Krinkle> The third one (iPhone ajax) is a genuine error but suspicious
[15:28:32] <Krinkle> I'll re-run that one as well
[15:34:32] <m_gol> Krinkle rwaldron: these might have sth to do with this: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/89714da93460d68941c44563d26c7b6213affb9f
[15:35:15] <m_gol> Krinkle rwaldron: but we can't be sure before updating to QUnit 1.14 which requires merging this PR first: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/248
[15:39:59] <Krinkle> rwaldron: They're all green now on http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2474
[15:40:06] <Krinkle> looks like they were false positives or race conditions 
[15:40:28] <rwaldron> Krinkle I figured as much, since they hadn't failed when I ran them manually on browserstack
[15:40:38] <rwaldron> ok, thanks for taking a look
[15:54:37] <m_gol> they almost never fail
[15:54:44] <m_gol> that's why we suspect it's Sinon-related
[15:55:15] <m_gol> if you're running locally, you don't depend on setTimeout being a true one in some cases, TestSwarm needs to listen to that in a couple of places
[15:55:23] <m_gol> rwaldron ^^^
[15:55:41] <rwaldron> I see
[15:55:46] <rwaldron> thanks again
