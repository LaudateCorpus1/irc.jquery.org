[10:49:09] <Jayflux> is it just me or is the bug tracker very slow to load?
[10:50:50] <scott_gonzalez> Jayflux: jQuery is transitions to GitHub issues.
[10:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> Use that instead.
[10:51:47] <Jayflux> scott_gonzalez,  you sure about that? i only see 2 issues on the jquery repo
[10:53:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm positive.
[10:54:28] <robertmaxrees> wasn't the transition made because trac is so slow?
[10:55:27] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[10:57:05] <snover> trac isnâ€™t slow if you apply the fix to stop it from garbage collecting when users visit
[10:57:40] <snover> which causes one big-ass table lock
[10:58:52] <scott_gonzalez> snover: I've given up on discussing Trac + jQuery Core. I have no desire to stop using Trac for jQuery UI.
[10:59:36] <snover> iâ€™m just saying it in case that knowledge got lost in one transfer or another

[19:18:26] <Krinkle> ben_alman: Remember https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-hashchange/pull/45 :)
[19:18:42] <Krinkle> I invested a fair bit of time into the refactor, would be nice to see it merged.
[19:19:04] <Krinkle> Since a few people at Wikimedia are using it, if you'd rather to a transfer (with redirect, thx to github), I'd take that, too.
[19:19:11] <Krinkle> under @wikimedia or @Krinkle
[19:33:17] <miketaylr> Krinkle: good luck :)
