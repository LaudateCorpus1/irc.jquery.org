[09:48:33] <gnarf> johnkpaul: bring this up over here?
[09:48:56] <johnkpaul> hey, sure
[09:50:08] <johnkpaul> gnarf: mikesherov I've been spending some time looking at the effects tests, and thinking about how to include sinon fake timers
[09:50:21] <johnkpaul> I'd like your thoughts on how to approach this
[09:50:48] <johnkpaul> currently, the tests are failing on master, so I started from the 2.0.0 branch
[09:52:02] <gnarf> so, i think we could do a setup/teardown that puts the fake timers in place
[09:52:09] <gnarf> for the effects modules
[09:52:30] <gnarf> perhaps do something like set the jQuery.fx.interval to 10 so we have a nice number
[09:53:05] <johnkpaul> yeah, I did that and I was surprised that jQuery.now holds a reference to Date.now, so I couldn't just mock out Date.now
[09:53:07] <johnkpaul> gnarf: https://github.com/johnkpaul/jquery/commit/b2592dcdcd4e4dcb7552c46a6b8ff0539d4c8516#diff-3
[09:53:19] <gnarf> hrm
[09:54:02] <johnkpaul> ah, what is jQuery.fx.interval, I was going to look into why there was a very regular bit of delay
[09:55:19] <johnkpaul> anyway, that I can work through, what I'm wondering is where to start these changes and how to ensure that these tests are still valid after changes
[09:55:28] <johnkpaul> should I work from the 2.0.0 tag?
[10:10:10] <gnarf> for now sure, i mean, the rebase might be hell
[10:10:20] <gnarf> but like - it should be mostly clean
[10:10:21] <gnarf> :)
[10:10:36] <gnarf> jQuery.fx.interval == the number of ms for the interval loop
[10:10:55] <gnarf> so if it was set to 10, you could advance the clock by 10 and hit a point and check that it is 1/10 of the 100ms animate
[10:10:59] <gnarf> and be like super accurate about it

[11:12:19] <johnkpaul> gnarf: ah I see, jQuery.fx.interval will be useful, and probably why some of my clock.ticks seemed so irregular
[11:12:41] <johnkpaul> I'm hoping that my changes to the tests are minimal, and almost purely additive, so I'll cross my fingers on the merge
