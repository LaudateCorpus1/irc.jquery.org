[11:13:53] <JamesMGreene> Ooo, San Fran, eh?
[11:29:08] <gnarf> we can add this bug to the "list of random chrome bugs we fix" https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=333868 :)
[11:31:44] <robertmaxrees> that's a neat one.

[12:18:13] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer mikesherov: Since this is easily lost in a sea of comments: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1411/files#r23040126
[12:39:04] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: Mike has been working on draggable in master while Dave works on draggable in interactions branch
[12:39:18] <mikesherov> Milestone release when draggable is ‚Äúdone‚Äù (not necessary with 1.13 release)
[12:39:24] <mikesherov> 1.12: Deprecate distance and delay for all interactions.
[12:39:36] <mikesherov> 1.13: Merge rewritten draggable on interaction.js to master, replace mouse with interaction for the others, without a rewrite (yet)
[12:39:36] <mikesherov> Change containment default to ‚Äúhtml‚Äù (aka document.documentElement)
[12:39:36] <mikesherov> Deprecate all other draggable options that we‚Äôll remove in 1.14, remove them later
[12:39:48] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I have that sitting in my inbox from the chicago meeting
[12:40:02] <mikesherov> all of those steps you have documented somewhere?
[12:43:18] <scott_gonzalez> I do now :-P
[12:43:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure they're in a document somewhere, but I have it in my todo list now, so I'll make sure it's documented in the right place.
