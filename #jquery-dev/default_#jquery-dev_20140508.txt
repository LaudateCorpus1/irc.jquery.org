[01:01:29] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core 1.x Weekly build #30: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201.x%20Weekly/30/
[01:01:30] <doesallmagic2> m.goleb: Ajax, Manipulation: don't test cross-document manip in Android 2.3
[08:11:58] <markelog> jzaefferer: hey, you there?
[08:16:55] <markelog> jzaefferer: when new version of the qunit will be released? Under what version? 1.15? Krinkle|detached?
[08:25:46] <jzaefferer> markelog: yeah, 1.15 is next. So far the only interesting change is the totalTests in QUnit.begin, otherwise its CSS fixes and random build and style fixes...
[08:26:20] <markelog> do decided on the date yet?
[08:27:15] <jzaefferer> No, usually there's no need to
[08:27:31] <jzaefferer> Why are you asking?
[08:27:39] <jzaefferer> Looking for the QUnit.begin change or anything else?
[08:29:49] <markelog> preparing PR for karma-qunit repo
[08:30:11] <markelog> so when qunit will be released, adapter for karma could be released too
[08:31:53] <jzaefferer> ok
[08:32:16] <jzaefferer> There's several open PRs for QUnit right now, would be good to get those closes (landed or not, whatever), then doing anothe release
[08:36:23] <dcherman> markelog: might want to check out the PR queue on the karma-qunit repo, i already made that PR :)
[08:59:56] <markelog> dcherman: cool
[09:00:58] <markelog> you beat me to it :-)

[15:49:21] <reavowed> Hi all
[15:49:32] <reavowed> I have a potentially useful comment for one of the open jquery bugs
[15:49:44] <reavowed> But because I just registered, I don't think I'm allowed to add it?
[15:50:37] <reavowed> Is there a sensible way for me to share my thoughts?
[15:54:19] <markelog> you allowed to add comments
[16:01:44] <reavowed> I can't for the life of me work out how
[16:02:06] <reavowed> Visiting http://bugs.jquery.com/newticket tells me I don't have the TICKET_CREATE privilege
[16:02:37] <reavowed> and http://bugs.jquery.com/wiki/TracPermissions implies that this should go with the TICKET_MODIFY one as an authenticated user
[16:11:52] <markelog> hm, we had a lot of spam recently, it might one of the actions taken to prevent it
[16:12:12] <markelog> damn, he is left (
