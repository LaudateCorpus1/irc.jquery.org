[07:41:12] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Color build #84: FAILURE in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/84/
[07:41:13] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: Ensure white and black both have a saturation of 0 to keep them in greyscale color space. - Closes gh-47
[08:11:24] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Color build #85: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/85/
[08:11:25] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: Adding @bseth99 to AUTHORS.TXT - Thanks for the contribution
[14:14:57] <Gho5t> Is there a bug that prevents <area> elements from firing cllick handlers?
[14:34:22] <gnarf> not that I'm aware of
[14:34:33] <gnarf> I've used that before with some success
[14:34:38] <gnarf> got a fiddle?
[14:38:45] <Gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/w9E4t/1/
[14:40:00] <scott_gonzalez> That fiddle is working for me.
[14:41:39] <Gho5t> really
[14:41:41] <Gho5t> in firefox?
[14:42:05] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[14:42:11] <gnarf> confirm
[14:42:11] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/w9E4t/5/
[14:42:20] <gnarf> chrome/ff
[14:42:43] <gnarf> as in confirm worksforme
[14:42:59] <Gho5t> which version of firefox please
[14:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> 16
[14:43:18] <Gho5t> I'm using 16.0.1 and not seeing anything logged
[14:43:19] <Gho5t> weird
[14:44:24] <gnarf> 15
[14:44:26] <Gho5t> http://jsfiddle.net/w9E4t/6/
[14:44:30] <Gho5t> is this alerting for you guys too
[14:45:28] <gnarf> no, but the render looks way different to me from chrome
[14:45:38] <Gho5t> yeah
[14:45:39] <gnarf> so it seems an html/stacking issue probably
[14:46:00] <Gho5t> what do you mean exactly
[15:06:42] <gnarf> like something isn't valid about what you're doing and chrome is more forgiving
[16:12:01] <mikesherov> gnarf: updated JSHint on jquery-color
[16:12:17] <gnarf> mikesherov: cool, shove it in :)
[16:12:23] <mikesherov> it's in already
[16:12:36] <gnarf> oh, is the commit bot not setup for color
[16:12:38] <gnarf> lame
[16:12:46] <mikesherov> I thought it was
[16:12:53] <gnarf> mikesherov: how do you feel about number format?
[16:13:01] <gnarf> mikesherov: like you think we should add it?
[16:13:03] <mikesherov> I left a comment :-)
[16:13:05] <gnarf> i'm on the fence
[16:13:13] <mikesherov> I don't know of any other numeric color formats
[16:13:33] <gnarf> k, i'll rewrite it to use actual bitwise operators
[16:13:36] <gnarf> rather than floor
[16:13:41] <mikesherov> yes
[16:13:51] <gnarf> and push it in
[16:13:51] <mikesherov> At the end of the day, we get to decide what the numeric number format we accept is
[16:14:07] <gnarf> yeah, any others have to get delegated to a .fn. method
[16:14:08] <mikesherov> and one that has interop with WebGL is quite a compelling use case
[16:14:16] <gnarf> agree
[16:14:22] <mikesherov> cool
[16:21:08] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg created promisea (+1 new commit): http://git.io/kppF1g

[16:22:57] <gnarf> interesting

[17:58:18] <danheberden> meta, because the added authors can
[18:01:21] <DaveMethvin> as Shakespeare said, "A project with one additional name would build as sweet."
