[11:31:05] <leobalter> gibson042 jzaefferer Krinkle QUnit Meeting
[11:31:18] <gibson042> ready
[11:32:17] <leobalter> it's the -m to open the channel, right?
[11:32:39] <gibson042> I believe so, but you might have to +o yourself first
[11:33:11] <leobalter> oh, I don't know how to do that :)
[11:34:03] <leobalter> well
[11:34:39] <gibson042> try `/msg ChanServ op #jquery-meeting leobalter`
[11:35:09] <leobalter> not working. 
[11:35:13] <leobalter> We can continue this here
[11:35:15] <gibson042> ok
[11:35:54] <leobalter> first thing: welcome to team, gibson042! :) I've opened an issue on qunitjs.com to update the about page
[11:36:04] <gibson042> editing markdown now :)
[11:36:34] <leobalter> also, I'm trying waffle.io. It's working fine so far. https://waffle.io/jquery/qunit/join
[11:37:11] <leobalter> There I can organize what I'm planning to work next and easily check what's in progress.
[11:37:54] <leobalter> Also, I've set an priority order (from top to bottom) on the next issues to work. 
[11:38:25] <leobalter> I still need to finish checking the column on the left, there are some closed issues/PRs there that need to be moved to the "Done" column.
[11:38:55] <leobalter> also, the Summit was great! We've got 2 PRs already merged to master. 
[11:39:03] <gibson042> \o/
[11:40:41] <leobalter> We've got several issues fixed since last meeting.
[11:42:11] <leobalter> now my next plan (already on Waffle) is to check the usage of LoDash (using _.isEqual and _.create) and webpack (to bundle QUnit with the lodash methods.
[11:42:41] <gibson042> awesome
[11:43:00] <leobalter> I might also get the #644, finishing the reporter interface.
[11:43:07] <gibson042> there are several QUnit methods that have more robust equivalents in LoDash
[11:43:23] <leobalter> yes
[11:43:59] <leobalter> the first part is: see how to bundle QUnit with webpack, if we get that, we will be probably fine to use LoDash methods
[11:44:10] <leobalter> webpack/browserify
[11:44:45] <leobalter> I have only a small preference using webpack because I've used it more than browserify, but honestly both should do the work.
[11:45:19] <gibson042> right
[11:46:24] <leobalter> And regarding to the waffle ready column: it's not necessary to work only on the issues that are listed there. The issues on the backlog column are also good to work.
[11:46:30] <leobalter> maybe less priority only
[11:46:36] <leobalter> JamesMGreeneAway: ping
[11:47:32] <leobalter> Ok, James is busy, I'll work next on the logging interface
[11:48:01] <leobalter> gibson042: anything else to update?
[11:48:26] <gibson042> I don't think so
[11:49:49] <leobalter> I saw on js-reporters they fixed the build process. 
[11:50:30] <leobalter> that's all. I'm looking forward to your PR on the qunitjs.com
[11:50:43] <leobalter> I'll tweet when it's ready :)
[11:51:06] <gibson042> thanks

[12:46:07] <Krinkle> leobalter: I keep missing the meeting as it coincides with another meeting.
[12:46:16] <Krinkle> How are things going?
[12:46:28] <Krinkle> I'm happy to see our brainstorm session from the conference last year finally paying off.
[12:46:47] <Krinkle> It seemed simple on paper, but I'm glad to see it all come to life 
[12:46:58] <Krinkle> test nesting, event emitter and more :)

[14:05:58] <scott_gonzalez> And now you HAVE to work on it :-P

[14:06:06] <gibson042> that's a nice trick

[14:58:31] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[14:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> And as a result of the 100% coverage, we have no bugs!
