[08:56:08] <markelog> leobalter: so what kind of issues we're facing there?
[08:56:28] <leobalter> QUnit now fails on leaked async assertions
[08:56:37] <leobalter> I might check if that's exactly the problem
[08:56:42] <leobalter> so far I got through this: https://github.com/leobalter/jquery/compare/jquery:master...leobalter:qunit-1.15?expand=1
[08:57:09] <markelog> do you need help?
[09:00:13] <leobalter> I need extra time :)
[09:00:52] <leobalter> but I would be glad if you could check the failing tests if you can also catch and fix some leaking assertions. I'll verify the other tests
[09:01:14] <markelog> okay, will do
[09:07:27] <Krinkle> markelog: what would be the difference between >= and ^ in this case?
[09:07:34] <Krinkle> avoid 2.0 ?
[09:17:56] <markelog> yeah
[10:16:38] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15leobalter opened pull request #627: Reporter: Implements the console reporter (06master...06console-log) 02http://git.io/yeODwA
