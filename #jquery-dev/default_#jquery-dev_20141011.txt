[05:45:44] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[05:45:55] <DaveMethvin> hey m_gol 
[05:46:34] <m_gol> Sizzle is failing one test on iOS8 and I wonder - should I add it to our Karma tests or just post an issue and fix it (or wait for it to be fixed) before adding it?
[05:46:54] <m_gol> this would make every commit fail the tests until the bug is fixed
[05:47:12] <DaveMethvin> let's wait then, it's so depressing to see so many fails :)
[05:47:15] <m_gol> ;)
[05:47:18] <m_gol> ok, I'll post an issue
[05:47:23] <DaveMethvin> thanks!

[06:49:19] <m_gol> congratulations, Apple
[06:49:29] <m_gol> UA of iOS8 emulator is different from UA of real iOS8
[06:49:33] <m_gol> in an important way
[06:49:51] <DaveMethvin> geez
[06:49:53] <m_gol> iPhone OS 8_0_2 vs. iPhone OS 10_10
[06:50:03] <DaveMethvin> whoa that IS different
[06:50:11] <DaveMethvin> well thank goodness NOBODY uses UA sniffing
[06:50:14] <DaveMethvin> :)
[06:50:18] <m_gol> they took version of OS X instead of iOS
[06:50:29] <m_gol> bad news is BrowserStack uses the emulator, obviously
[06:50:38] <m_gol> so until they fix it, we cannot test iOS8 in TestSwarm
[06:50:47] <m_gol> (we can on Karma since we don't UA-sniff there)

[15:23:37] <m_gol> how many more weird host objects does IE11 have? :/
[15:23:43] <m_gol> history.pushState({a: 2}, 'a', 'b');
[15:23:43] <m_gol> var o = history.state;
[15:23:44] <m_gol> console.log(o === history.state); // false
[15:38:43] <m_gol> o lol, even better: history.state === history.state; // false
