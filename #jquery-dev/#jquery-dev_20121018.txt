[07:08:03] <ryanneufeld> gibson042: are you interesed in having an account on znc.jquery.com?
[07:08:26] <gibson042> what's that?
[07:08:34] <ryanneufeld> irc bouncer
[07:08:39] <ryanneufeld> you'd basically be logged in all the time
[07:08:50] <ryanneufeld> and then connect to it instead of freenode
[07:08:58] <ryanneufeld> when you log in you get backlogs
[07:09:07] <gibson042> yeah, that sounds pretty nice

[11:39:27] <gnarf> RWhitbeck: I'll try again, last time I was there, their "forgot password" box was broken
[11:39:34] <gnarf> i couldn't retrieve the password, I know what the email is now
[11:40:05] <RWhitbeck> Is there a ticket I can point them too?  I seem to remember there being one?  Or is it a private repo.
[11:41:32] <gnarf> its in infra
[11:41:40] <gnarf> paul_irish: ping on this too
[11:42:41] <gnarf> paul_irish: I'm really very very very upset with this BS forgot password/feedburner issue.  If I send you a message from jquery.org can you forward it along to whomever can make sure to get this fixed (finally)
[11:44:29] <gnarf> the "forgot password" part of this is TOTALLY broken http://cl.ly/image/3C2d38134609
[11:48:53] <RWhitbeck> gnarf I think it's time to transition to another feed service.  I've heard that it's going to be killed off eventually.   Thoughts?
[11:49:07] <gnarf> why can't we just serve our RSS?
[11:49:15] <gnarf> do we need a "feed service"?
[11:49:20] <gnarf> or what did it do for us
[11:49:24] <gnarf> beyond an RSS
[11:51:33] <RWhitbeck> stats.
[11:51:46] <RWhitbeck> but apparently no one has looked at it in a long time ;-)
[11:51:58] <gnarf> we can get stats from our own logs right?
[11:52:02] <gnarf> splunk
[11:52:02] <gnarf> etc
[11:52:03] <gnarf> ?
[11:52:09] <RWhitbeck> you tell me :)
[12:04:55] <RWhitbeck> gnarf I replied to that thread.  Let me know what you decide to do.
[12:06:49] <gnarf> RWhitbeck: i had to change the log format - but I think I should be able to figure out what URL it's hitting now
[12:07:10] <gnarf> just gotta wait

[12:26:11] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from ryah: We should not be supporting more programming languages. We should be killing them. All these bullshit projects are confusing people. ★ http://bit.ly/Wtjblt
[12:26:13] <johnbender> c'mon
[12:26:17] <johnbender> you retweeted that?
[12:26:37] <johnbender> I have my own opinions but that seems like a departure for you no?
[12:26:55] <johnbender> granted we're not besties or anything so maybe I've got you pegged wrong :)
[12:52:38] <miketaylr> everyone should just use php
[12:52:58] <gf3> php.js
[12:53:53] <gf3> johnbender: I enjoyed this → http://twatlr.com/thread/258647359477665792
[12:54:12] <paul_irish> RWhitbeck: gnarf: you should host your own rssfeed. badassjs has a guide on it
[12:54:19] <paul_irish> the feedburner story is not good
[12:55:04] <gnarf> paul_irish: thanks
[12:55:10] <gnarf> paul_irish: I'll just move that way then
[12:55:26] <gf3> gnarf: Just use FriendFeed
[12:55:27] <gf3> BOOM!
[12:56:54] <johnbender> gf3: I retweeted that :)
[12:57:46] <paul_irish> lol
[12:57:58] <paul_irish> johnbender: were you at jsconf eu for a total of 3 hours? ahah
[12:58:12] <johnbender> paul_irish: :( my wife was with me
[12:58:22] <johnbender> paul_irish: in berlin that is
[12:58:34] <johnbender> but I was there until like 3 each day
[12:58:37] <johnbender> didn't go the parties
[12:58:39] * johnbender is lame
[12:58:46] <johnbender> paul_irish: why?
[12:59:05] <paul_irish> just curious because i didnt see you except for that brief moment
[12:59:43] <johnbender> paul_irish: I was fairly social (for me at least), I got to hang out with the facebook folks for a while
[12:59:49] <johnbender> they sympathized with my "mobile pain"
[13:00:10] <johnbender> I acknowledge that should be more social at these events :)
[13:00:15] <paul_irish> hah
[13:00:22] <paul_irish> you gonna work at facebook?
[13:00:29] <johnbender> paul_irish: no
[13:00:48] <johnbender> I'm applying to grad school for fall 2013 anyhow
[13:00:51] <paul_irish> ah, then you should come over to mountain view
[13:01:17] <paul_irish> enjoy whatever the eff is happening to your $goog stock options right now
[13:01:21] <paul_irish> haha
[13:02:43] <johnbender> lol
[17:24:13] <ryanneufeld> Anyone still in DC?
