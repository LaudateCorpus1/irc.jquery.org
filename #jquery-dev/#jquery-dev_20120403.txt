[06:08:10] <SimonSimCity> Hi, all
[06:08:14] <SimonSimCity> There seems to be something wrong with the jquery-bug-tracker .. I often get the error-message "MySQL server has gone away" ... I'm not quite sure if this is the right place to post it ..
[06:08:47] <SimonSimCity> And if it works, I just see the whole source-code in IE9 .. FF12 works
[06:19:39] <SimonSimCity> Is someone around who can fix this? :) At least the problem with the MySQL server ..
[10:24:07] <ryanneufeld> woot, got my JQ SF tix!
[11:23:14] <johnbender> danheberden: https://gist.github.com/68dfc962f4c20802aa36
[11:23:47] <johnbender> there aren't any builds running but that shell script is eating 96+% of the cpu
[11:23:57] <johnbender> I pinged jzaefferer too
[11:25:39] <johnbender> not sure if that's normal or not but we're seeing build failures on jenkins with: "Could not create Java virtual machine" and our old friend "Cannot allocate memory"
[11:43:21] <Krinkle> .
[11:43:53] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: You there?

[13:17:32] <gnarf> ?tell jaubourg - check yer skype!
[13:17:33] <bot-t> gnarf, Okay.
[13:36:01] <jzaefferer> hey Krinkle
[13:36:02] <bot-t> (17 hours 50 mins ago) <scott_gonzalez> tell jzaefferer I fixed bouncy tooltips
[13:36:43] <jzaefferer> johnbender: clarkbox is back, I've sent that to him as well
[13:39:24] <clarkbox> im actually looking into the browserstack integration right now.there has been 200+min of browserstack time in the last 24hrs, so it seems to be running. but it does not seem to be running as often as it was. huge drop off on march 21ish
[13:40:41] <jzaefferer> Well, it has been running way to much, at least we got word from BrowserStack that we were hammering their servers
[13:41:01] <clarkbox> ok. ill get to the bottom of it
[13:47:26] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I've done a start with twitter bootstrap
[13:47:32] <Krinkle> can you check it out and tell me what you think of it?
[13:48:01] <Krinkle> It needs a few adjustments but overall I like it
[13:56:40] <jzaefferer> btw. clarkbox, I've been trying to compile phantomjs 1.5 on that server today, which I still didn't get to work :/
[13:57:25] <clarkbox> remind me what that is for again?
[13:57:38] <jzaefferer> headless everything, mostly unit testing
[14:00:07] <clarkbox> oh i dont recall that initiative. Thats going on swarm server?
[14:00:29] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: ping
[14:01:06] <jzaefferer> I once had 1.3 working, but that required xvfb (or whatever that was called)
[14:01:46] <clarkbox> i recently set up phantomjs on another server/project. i remember it was a pain in the ass.
[14:02:10] <clarkbox> can swarm handle that load? last i heard, it was pretty loaded down. can we put it on another server?
[14:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> clarkbox: that u/p is correct.
[14:09:02] <clarkbox> ya just tried it again. worked
[14:09:04] <clarkbox> thanks
[14:09:40] <clarkbox> i dont see any problems tho. besides the stuck process, which should not have been causing excessive worker requests
[14:09:53] <clarkbox> looking at the logs, browserstack usage was at a consistent level
[14:10:06] <clarkbox> no surge
[14:10:07] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[14:10:19] <clarkbox> i think it was likely legit usage
[14:10:29] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: once danheberden is done with the puppet setup, we'll probably move things off that swarm machine to a new one anyway
[14:12:30] <clarkbox> you can see a bar graph of usage by day here:
[14:12:31] <clarkbox> https://swarm-01.host.jquery.net:8000/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?q=search%20source%3D%22%2Fvar%2Flog%2Ftestswarm-browserstack.log%22%20started&earliest=0
[14:12:58] <clarkbox> then it just dropped off on the 21st
[14:13:20] <clarkbox> but there was a rather large uptick in usage on march 7th
[14:13:40] <jzaefferer> Getting an SSL warning there, but "proceed anyway" does nothing :/ silly Chrome
[14:13:43] <clarkbox> but not an unprecedented usage level
[14:13:53] <clarkbox> odd
[14:15:05] <clarkbox> and now, it seems like browser stack has us to the end of the queue. when i spark up a bunch of browsers, they are not running
[14:17:04] <clarkbox> here is output of most recent run...
[14:17:05] <clarkbox> Tue Apr 03 2012 14:15:13 GMT-0700 (PDT) needed workers: [3,10,11,12,13,14,16,17,18,21,23,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36]
[14:17:06] <clarkbox> Tue Apr 03 2012 14:15:13 GMT-0700 (PDT) currnet workers:
[14:17:06] <clarkbox> [{"id":10745,"browser":{"name":"ie","version":"8.0"},"status":"queue"},{"id":10746,"browser":{"name":"ie","version":"9.0"},"status":"queue"},{"id":10747,"browser":{"name":"opera","version":"11.1"},"status":"queue"},{"id":10748,"browser":{"name":"opera","version":"11.5"},"status":"queue"},{"id":10749,"browser":{"name":"ie","version":"10.0"},"status":"queue"},{"id":10750,"browser":{"name":"firefox","version":"3.6"},"status":"queue"},{"id":10751,"browse
[14:17:06] <clarkbox> ame":"safari","version":"5.0"},"status":"queue"},{"id":10752,"browser":{"name":"safari","version":"5.1"},"status":"queue"},{"id":10753,"browser":{"name":"firefox","version":"10.0"},"status":"queue"}]
[14:17:23] <clarkbox> so you can see testswarm tells us it needs a lot of clients
[14:17:29] <clarkbox> and they are all already started
[14:17:36] <clarkbox> well, requested (not started)
[14:18:01] <Krinkle> Hm..
[14:18:16] <Krinkle> they're queued
[14:18:19] <clarkbox> ya
[14:18:25] <Krinkle> maybe browserstack is overloaded?
[14:18:29] <Krinkle> or the queue is broken
[14:18:47] <clarkbox> well they may have throttled us because we were using an excessive amount of browser time
[14:19:20] <clarkbox> now, that MAY have been illegitimate time - where we were requesting browsers that were not actually needed, and the workers are sitting idle
[14:19:43] <clarkbox> but im not sure that was the case
[14:19:46] <Krinkle> "Unlimited time" ?
[14:20:21] <clarkbox> im going to send them an email, and ask them to remove the throttle, and ill keep my eye on things, and make sure we are not sending bogus requests
[14:20:32] <Krinkle> Hm.. the api-created instances do shutdown after 30 minutes though? so it can't be that much
[14:20:56] <Krinkle> and we could even terminate them ourselves if they are no longer needed
[14:21:12] <clarkbox> well if they shut it down, the next run we would ask it to start right back up again
[14:21:30] <Krinkle> getneeded does take actual runs in consideration
[14:21:34] <Krinkle> not just online-ness of useragents
[14:21:42] <clarkbox> that is IF testswarm getneeded endpoint was not reporting the clients correctly
[14:22:28] <Krinkle> I've refactored getneeded in testswarm 0.3.0 (not named 'swarmstate' it includes how many are online of each browser and how many pending runs
[14:22:51] <Krinkle> so once 0.3.0 has been tested to be stable enough I suggest we update the script to use that
[14:22:58] <clarkbox> yes sounds good
[14:23:02] <Krinkle> if there are 0 unrun tests and we have an instance for that browser, shut it down
[14:23:17] <Krinkle> right not getneeded doesn't allow that because it includes the browserstack agents
[14:23:22] <Krinkle> right now*
[14:23:28] <clarkbox> Krinkle could you wipe out all current test-runs?
[14:23:38] <Krinkle> How?
[14:23:51] <Krinkle> I'm not sure what you mean
[14:24:09] <clarkbox> well im asking browserstack to remove throttle. and to avoid running the backlog of tests currently in swarm queue, id like to wipe them out
[14:24:20] <Krinkle> if you mean on swarm.jquery.org, then no, I don't have any access to that.
[14:24:23] <clarkbox> ah
[14:24:24] <clarkbox> ok
[14:24:29] <Krinkle> (not yet anyway.. :P )
[14:27:59] <clarkbox> do you know what i would have to do to clear out the backlog?
[14:31:18] <clarkbox> krinkle, jzaefferer ?
[14:31:33] <Krinkle> clarkbox: What do you want to do?
[14:31:39] <Krinkle> Remove past jobs up to today?
[14:31:45] <clarkbox> flush the test queue
[14:31:49] <clarkbox> yes
[14:32:28] <Krinkle> The way I do it is, msyql dump the 'users' table, then drop the entire database, re-create it, run testswarm.sql and useragents.sql and import users table again
[14:33:02] <Krinkle> there may be easier ways but due to the foreign key restrictions, I like this simple/aggresive way instead :)
[14:33:28] <jzaefferer> clarkbox: you can do that, you've got ssh access
[14:34:35] <clarkbox> yes, simply aggressive.
[14:34:57] <jzaefferer> looks like I managed to compile phantomjs, wow
[14:35:10] <jzaefferer> aaanyway
[14:35:14] <clarkbox> nice work!
[14:35:23] <jzaefferer> run
[14:35:42] <jzaefferer> this: /srv/swarm.jquery.org/htdocs/sql_update_useragents.sh
[14:35:55] <jzaefferer> actualy
[14:35:56] <jzaefferer> don't
[14:36:11] <jzaefferer> we shouldn't pull from master right now
[14:36:19] <jzaefferer> nevermind, I'll edit that to only reset jobs
[14:36:46] <jzaefferer> okay, all clear
[14:37:14] <clarkbox> run that now?
[14:37:28] <clarkbox> oh
[14:37:34] <clarkbox> you cleared it
[14:37:34] <clarkbox> thanks
[14:38:02] <clarkbox> sent email to browserstack. will report back when things are running again.
[14:43:24] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Can you check out the twitterbootstrapskin branch on jquery/testswarm later today (or tomorrow)?

[17:15:41] <mikesherov> rwaldron: you here?
[17:16:32] <DaveMethvin> wow you're a pull requestin' fool today mikesherov!
[17:17:03] <DaveMethvin> i hope i can still find the code after i land all these byte-shaving pull requests
[17:17:42] <mikesherov> well, they are my original pull reuqests
[17:17:51] <mikesherov> I just redid them against 1.8
[17:18:08] <mikesherov> don't pull in 10413
[17:18:27] <rwaldron> mikesherov sort of
[17:18:28] <bot-t> (7 hours 55 mins ago) <iros> tell rwaldron fyi http://projects.latimes.com/prop8/donation/8930/
[17:18:47] <mikesherov> Oh, OK. I was just gonna say that I was here if you wanted to give direct feedback
[17:18:57] <mikesherov> but through the pull requests is fine
[17:19:26] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I'm still doing some final tweaks from rick, and having the ability to specify a hook for a vendor-prefixed property and un-prefixed property
[17:20:17] <DaveMethvin> i was taking a run thru the bug tracker and my next stop is the pull request q
[17:20:42] <DaveMethvin> let's hope all these changes merge quietly without drama
[17:20:43] <mikesherov> Hooray!
[17:20:49] <mikesherov> Mine should be fine mostly
[17:20:55] <mikesherov> I'll get 10413 in order then
[17:21:07] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: http://memegenerator.net/instance/17787965 is priceless
[17:21:26] <mikesherov> this one is fine to merge: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/725
[17:21:27] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (56m, 13s ago): avoid unnecessary delegation as an optimization
[17:21:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah i like that one
[17:22:03] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: do you have the inner/outerWidth/Height as a setter ticket?
[17:22:06] <rwaldron> mikesherov whats with two tickets in one?
[17:22:17] <mikesherov> it was 1 ticket
[17:22:34] <mikesherov> and then I created a second jquery bug when I was just getting started to help advocate for it in 1.8
[17:22:42] <mikesherov> I was/am a noob
[17:22:53] <mikesherov> and then it got accepted
[17:23:03] <mikesherov> so really, this one PR is to do both those things
[17:23:42] <mikesherov> but really, it's to do one thing (do the right thing for border box) that needed another thing (ability to detect border-box) to get it done
[17:23:57] <rwaldron> are webkit and moz the only browsers that prefix the box szing stuff?
[17:24:16] <mikesherov> yes
[17:24:29] <rwaldron> is it implemented in any other browser?
[17:24:39] <mikesherov> yes, unprefixed in opera and IE
[17:24:46] <rwaldron> ok, cool
[17:24:57] <mikesherov> I had it doing o and ms as well at first, and then did some research to make sure
[17:25:01] <mikesherov> and then dropped those
[17:25:22] <rwaldron> ok
[17:25:40] <rwaldron> lots of tests
[17:25:41] <rwaldron> nice
[17:26:32] <mikesherov> just tried to cover every case I could think of
[17:26:37] <mikesherov> untested code is broken code
[17:38:06] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: so there was a good discussion we had about browser support, did anything come out of that?
[17:38:50] <mikesherov> For example, it looks like we can drop the reliableMarginRight support test if we're not supporting Safari 5.0 anymore
[17:39:18] <DaveMethvin> the part I remember was that we wanted to have a list at ONE place, but i am not sure we yet have a list of browsers we support
[17:39:23] <DaveMethvin> mainly b/c of the mobile factor
[17:39:30] <mikesherov> :-\
[17:39:36] <DaveMethvin> we have the desktop rules down pretty well
[17:39:41] <mikesherov> That's my least favorite answer
[17:40:10] <DaveMethvin> well there's also the issue of what "support" means
[17:40:16] <mikesherov> right
[17:40:27] <DaveMethvin> like, it's a decent bet that most stuff still works on safari 3
[17:41:08] <mikesherov> and probably only Kit Cambridge and John David Dalton care that it still works in Safari 3
[17:41:57] <mikesherov> but when and how are we going to solve and answer those questions.
[17:42:17] <mikesherov> There are lots of things we can begin to cut right out if our support statement was clearer.
[17:42:37] <DaveMethvin> very good point ... ok i should take the point on this
[17:42:44] <DaveMethvin> dammit i want to be lazy waaaaah
[17:42:51] <mikesherov> HAHA
[17:43:06] <mikesherov> The only points I care about is what support tests do we need around
[17:43:13] <mikesherov> honestly, that's the only thing I care about
[17:43:44] <DaveMethvin> well the UI and Mobile guys care about whatever they're supporting obviously but perhaps are looking at it a different way
[17:44:08] <DaveMethvin> so they probably don't care if we break something as long as it's not something they care about
[17:44:19] <DaveMethvin> hmm, circular logic
[17:44:29] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't seem circular when i start to type it
[17:44:37] <mikesherov> right, but even then, they can duckpunch stuff for us
[17:44:45] <DaveMethvin> true
[17:44:59] <DaveMethvin> if it's really just a rare mobile platform for example
[17:45:01] <mikesherov> Like, I was asking mobile about the simplify offset PR
[17:45:14] <mikesherov> and they only seemed to care if they were even using .offset() themselves
[17:45:23] <DaveMethvin> but i'd think a lot of those are B or C grade and not using .offset anyway
[17:45:25] <mikesherov> and concluded they weren't really using it
[17:45:55] <DaveMethvin> so what are the basic questions we need them to answer?
[17:46:57] <mikesherov> 1. can we remove support tests that desktop doesn't care about
[17:47:15] <mikesherov> to which they may say something like: just send us a patch so we can test
[17:47:38] <DaveMethvin> i think that's on a case by case basis
[17:47:45] <mikesherov> Right
[17:47:50] <mikesherov> 2. what does "support" mean?
[17:48:12] <mikesherov> Does that mean core fixes bugs reported by mobile?
[17:48:21] <DaveMethvin> it can at times
[17:49:12] <DaveMethvin> at least in the past, we have not implied that mobile users *had* to use jQuery Mobile to work properly in jQuery
[17:49:29] <DaveMethvin> but otoh we haven't been clear about which mobile browsers we support
[17:49:42] <DaveMethvin> so the important thing is we can weasel out of it :P
[17:50:35] <mikesherov> LOL
[17:50:44] <DaveMethvin> I think we need a blog post about browser support to clarify this all, and formally state a lot of the things we're mumbling
[17:50:54] <mikesherov> 3. Which mobile browsers do we test in?
[17:51:06] <mikesherov> I think those are the big 3 questions about mobile support
[17:51:27] <DaveMethvin> if you come up with a 4. keep it to yourself!
[17:51:40] <mikesherov> 4. do we need to "support" all the browsers jQm is supporting
[17:51:44] <mikesherov> because that list is insanity
[17:51:56] <DaveMethvin> i've been meaning to look at browserstack support and see how well that works
[17:52:38] <mikesherov> Oh, no
[17:52:40] <mikesherov> don't bother
[17:52:53] <mikesherov> The android simulators will make your eyes bleed
[17:53:05] <mikesherov> they run about 1 test per second, no exaggerating
[17:53:16] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[17:53:33] <DaveMethvin> well that's another issue, our tests are getting kinda big
[17:53:47] <DaveMethvin> i wonder how much of our test coverage is duplicated
[17:54:49] <mikesherov> well, yeah, they're getting big, and we could do a whole sweep at removing redundant tests, but the point is that it'd take about 3 hours for the android test suite to run
[17:56:39] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if only there was some project that could measure test coverage.... ;)
[17:57:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah i've heard of that :P
[17:57:36] <gnarf> man
[17:57:48] <gnarf> my brain is so burnt out after that refactoring last night
[17:57:57] <gnarf> but i think i nailed that design i wanted
[17:58:03] <gnarf> and it seems to be supporting all the current shit
[17:58:38] <DaveMethvin> yay, it really did look better
[17:59:50] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/compare/master...1.8-effects for anyone else interested in looking at the current "base" i'm working on
[18:00:18] <gnarf> oksoclap.com/BixD4HaDYf a collection of thoughts on it
[18:00:33] <gnarf> mikesherov: input welcome :)
[18:00:51] <mikesherov> cool
[18:01:54] <mikesherov> holy shit gnarf
[18:02:22] <gnarf> i still haven't gone through any DRY on it yet
[18:02:35] <gnarf> just kinda slammin code down its throat to make sure it will support everything
[18:02:48] <mikesherov> I'll attempt to grok this so I can give some input
[18:03:06] <gnarf> TBH - even asking whats happening will help me identify what i need to comment
[18:03:07] <gnarf> :)
[18:03:09] <mikesherov> but manhttp://knowyourmeme.com/photos/87427
[18:03:17] <mikesherov> but man: http://knowyourmeme.com/photos/87427
[18:03:54] <gnarf> im not sure preFilter is strong enough yet
[18:04:04] <gnarf> cuz there is like this pipeline of setting that stuff up
[18:04:23] <mikesherov> OK, well, you're talking all jibberish to me right now
[18:04:41] <gnarf> its pretty much jibberish to me too
[18:04:45] <mikesherov> But I promise I will read the shit out of this code so I can have a sane intelligent conversation with you about it
[18:04:45] <gnarf> just organized
[18:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Can you put me on the bugs list?
[18:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like I'm missing lots of discussions :-/
[18:09:20] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Today, UI only cares about the browsers that core officially supports. That will probably remain true.
[18:09:54] <scott_gonzalez> And you know that I'll harass you guys if UI needs something :-P
[18:10:01] <mikesherov> Cool
[18:10:27] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: I've done a lot of work to css.js for border-box, were you planning on working on inner/outerheight as a setter?
[18:10:42] <scott_gonzalez> Did I file a ticket for that?
[18:10:48] <scott_gonzalez> We have it in UI already.
[18:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't look like I filed a ticket for it.
[18:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> Or at least if I did, it's no longer open.
[18:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, never filed a ticket for that.
[18:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> The closes was .inner/outer/Width/Height on window/document.
[18:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> s/closes/closest/
[18:15:11] <mikesherov> oh, http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10877 it was jzaefferer
[18:15:41] <mikesherov> It's MINE NOW
[18:16:13] <mikesherov> dmethvin: this looks like it was voted on for 1.87
[18:16:24] <mikesherov> 1.8... I'm going to put it in that milestone
[18:17:16] <scott_gonzalez> Bah, people need to learn not to link to files using a branch name...
[18:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> The link in that ticket comes close enough today, but could be totally wrong at any point in time.
[18:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure the code would be a lot smaller in core.
[18:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> Like 50% or more will give shaved off.
[18:18:29] <mikesherov> Yes
[18:18:55] <mikesherov> I have a pretty big set of changes for css.js especially on width/height
[18:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> So if that lands in 1.8, we can use it in like 2015 :D
[18:19:08] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: you should get an invite for bugs-team
[18:19:12] <mikesherov> and I'm going to roll that all in.
[18:19:38] <DaveMethvin> somehow this notebook gets its sound turned off and i miss notifications
[18:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks DaveMethvin.
[18:21:05] <DaveMethvin> i feel so deprived not being at #jsconf
[18:21:41] <mikesherov> agreed
[18:22:47] <gnarf> also agreed
[18:23:22] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Do you agree that this should be closed as wontfix? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8192
[18:23:45] <DaveMethvin> wat, you can'
[18:23:57] <DaveMethvin> t focus a hidden element? :)
[18:24:22] <DaveMethvin> dear user, the element is focused, you just can't SEE it
[18:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> I guess I'll take that as a yes :-)
[18:25:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah i definitely agree
[18:33:38] <snover> DaveMethvin: you’re such a superstar :)
[18:33:59] <DaveMethvin> uh oh, what did i do now?
[18:34:53] <snover> seems like every time I am paying attention someone is asking for your opinion
[18:34:57] <snover> even when you aren’t here
[18:37:14] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: 1 more question about "support"
[18:37:26] <DaveMethvin> yep
[18:37:34] <DaveMethvin> we are up to 5 now
[18:37:51] <scott_gonzalez> Just read the browser support thread.
[18:37:55] <mikesherov> 5. what does a "version" mean? For Safari, is 5.1 a version, or is 5.1.2 a version
[18:38:01] <scott_gonzalez> So we can stop esting in FF 3.6 this month?
[18:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> Please say 5.1
[18:38:35] <DaveMethvin> market share has to matter
[18:38:44] <DaveMethvin> that's how we got into the mess with ie, right?
[18:39:09] <mikesherov> To clarify, when we say Safari - 1 version, I think it means 5.0 and 5.1. Rick thinks it means 5.1.4 and 5.1.2
[18:39:23] <scott_gonzalez> Scott Gonzalez and I did some back of the envelope calculations based on
[18:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> google analytics that puts Safari <5.1 at 20% of Safari market share, which
[18:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> is around 6% of total market share. This puts Safari 5.0 and lower at 1.2%
[18:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> of the market, which conforms to stats from http://gs.statcounter.com
[18:39:27] <mikesherov> Yes, there are a few things that can go when we drop FF3.6 too
[18:39:55] <mikesherov> document.defaultView being the biggest
[18:40:00] <DaveMethvin> i think moz drops ff 3.6 this month, right?
[18:40:04] <mikesherov> 4/24
[18:40:09] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[18:40:17] <mikesherov> I want to make FF36countdown.com
[18:40:26] <mikesherov> a tribute to IE6countdown.com
[18:41:16] <DaveMethvin> well mikesherov i think my vote would be 5.0 and 5.1 but the reason we support two is b/c most browsers other than ie turn over quickly
[18:41:24] <DaveMethvin> so two is a safe bet
[18:41:30] <mikesherov> Sure
[18:41:36] <mikesherov> let's just clarify that
[18:41:49] <DaveMethvin> these are really guidelines, not hard rules that we point to so we can weasel out of supporting stuff
[18:41:57] <mikesherov> I have a ticket to fix a test in Safari 5.0
[18:42:02] <mikesherov> it's super simple
[18:42:04] <DaveMethvin> cause i would have weaseled out of ie6/7/8 a long time ago
[18:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I've been arguing for 5.0 and 5.1 :-)
[18:42:47] <DaveMethvin> oh in that case i'm siding with rwaldron :P
[18:43:18] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[18:43:26] <mikesherov> LOL
[18:45:00] <DaveMethvin> I LIKE YOUR NEW PULL REQUEST MIKESHEROV
[18:45:14] <DaveMethvin> text-transform: UPPERCASEY
[18:45:24] <mikesherov> I copy paste it from trac
[18:46:05] <mikesherov> It loses 8 bytes
[18:46:41] <DaveMethvin> wouldn't it be nice if 1.8 was smaller? a man can dream
[18:46:52] <mikesherov> Wait, no, I did make it smaller
[18:46:55] <mikesherov> 8 bytes!
[18:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts on making a useful input special event? http://mathiasbynens.be/notes/oninput
[18:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> We're gonna do it in UI.
[18:48:10] <DaveMethvin> that would be a good place, i think i closed the core ticket "plugin"
[18:48:26] <DaveMethvin> or maybe it was on the forum
[18:48:39] <mikesherov> OK, so DaveMethvin: I think if you're going to merge any of my stuff tonight into 1.8pre, you should merge these: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/728 https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/725
[18:48:40] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (4m, 15s ago): fixes #11443 CHECKCLONE AND APPENDCHECKED TEST FAILURES IN CHROME 18

[18:49:26] <mikesherov> because if/when you merge 728, I need to fix the simplify offset one again
[18:49:48] <DaveMethvin> i think imma wait til tomorrow to land things, i still have a bunch of other stuff and whenever i land stuff too late i make dumb mistakes
[18:50:18] <mikesherov> K
[18:50:29] <gnarf> mathias... sigh
[18:50:30] <gnarf> https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery-oninput/blob/master/jquery.oninput.js#L16
[18:50:39] <gnarf> really? trigger the one you remove??? :)
[18:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Triggering input would unbind keydown.
[18:52:32] <gnarf> broken still either way then
[18:52:37] <scott_gonzalez> Though, I guess that's a problem.
[18:52:38] <gnarf> and i just realized it too
[18:52:38] <gnarf> :)
[18:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> heh, definitely wrong.
[18:53:01] <DaveMethvin> so few lines, so many mistakes
[18:53:32] <scott_gonzalez> heh, it should really just be a special event.
[18:53:42] <scott_gonzalez> Can't do delegation with what he's got.
[18:53:50] <gnarf> yeah
[18:54:07] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone interested in doing it right? :-)
[18:54:44] <gnarf> i could look at it
[18:54:53] <gnarf> shouldn't be too difficult
[18:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Cool. Can you make sure it also works with paste on linux?
[18:55:22] <gnarf> it would be easiest to trigger a meta-event for it
[18:55:29] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8062
[18:55:49] <gnarf> i would think... have keydown/input/paste trigger "omginput"
[18:56:00] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:56:05] <scott_gonzalez> Does paste not normally trigger input?
[18:56:19] <gnarf> it probably does
[18:56:39] <gnarf> but im talking theory before testing... bad me....
[18:56:46] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> Just did a quick test and it does.
[18:57:12] <gnarf> speaking of which - i gotta see if i can get these jQuery 1.8 build tasks running
[18:57:24] <gnarf> anyone know which box builds jquery-latest.js right now?
[18:57:43] <gnarf> danheberden: ?
[19:01:59] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2/
[19:02:31] <DaveMethvin> it's a start...
[19:04:31] <gnarf> if only the browserstack was on top of this
[19:04:34] <gnarf> clarkbox:  ;)
[19:04:56] <DaveMethvin> yes, browserstack would be nice
[19:04:59] <DaveMethvin> and a pony
[19:06:57] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery 1.8 build #1: FAILURE in 5 min 53 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%201.8/1/
[19:07:36] <DaveMethvin> oh jenkins, I missed you so
[19:08:07] <DaveMethvin> ?tell jq-jenkins You say FAILURE I say LEARNING EXPERIENCE
[19:08:07] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, Okay.
[19:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> I really hope the next build passes :-P
[19:08:54] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: you're new around here aren't  you?
[19:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> It'd just be funny to see bot-t yell at jq-jenkins after he says that the build passed
[19:09:19] <DaveMethvin> jenkins always finds something to complain about
[19:09:37] <DaveMethvin> all those damn timers in the animations
[19:09:55] <DaveMethvin> too many racy conditions
[19:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> Check out my the awesomeness of my animation tests: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/4a6692a57aa156dcaa916af66b36f767a25e37c3
[19:10:31] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (1w, 4h ago): Accordion: Added animation tests.
[19:10:44] <Krinkle> Status: Running jQuery 1.8 commit #41056ab1957b44bf5be2184f5c566121a985b38a Effects tests...
[19:10:50] <Krinkle> ^ that one is timing out
[19:11:02] <scott_gonzalez> .promise() is so awesome for that.
[19:11:07] <Krinkle> In Chrome  at least
[19:11:22] <Krinkle> or not
[19:11:42] <DaveMethvin> the ones that are getting us into trouble are the "stopping about halfway through" type of tests
[19:11:52] <gnarf> yeah
[19:11:57] <gnarf> there is a better way to do that
[19:11:58] <DaveMethvin> where we are cancelling tests to see that they really stop
[19:11:58] <gnarf> btw
[19:12:12] <DaveMethvin> well good because what we are doing isn't working very well
[19:12:21] <gnarf> set duration fairly high, and .stop() from a custom step function
[19:12:32] <gnarf> i just came up with that
[19:12:32] <gnarf> just now
[19:12:34] <DaveMethvin> well i got the high duration part done already :P
[19:12:52] <DaveMethvin> since timers are stretched to 1 sec, i think i've already set the duration to 2 sec
[19:12:56] <DaveMethvin> but i may have missed some
[19:13:05] <Krinkle> I've started safari/chrome/opera{all versions}/FF2.6
[19:13:07] <DaveMethvin> i got one good run for 1.7.2 and then ran away quickly
[19:13:09] <Krinkle> 3.6*
[19:13:20] <DaveMethvin> ohboy!
[19:13:34] <gnarf> darnit danheberden - i need your intimate knowledge of our servers
[19:13:52] <DaveMethvin> no failures yet, what's up with that?
[19:16:11] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2/
[19:16:19] <Krinkle> 2 time outs, but hopefully those will recover
[19:17:10] <mikesherov> so, DaveMethvin, one question. I have another ticket I'm working on that is dependent on the CSS3 and border-box PR I have... should I submit another pull request that covers all 3 tickets?
[19:17:11] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if i could figure out which server was building the git version of jQuery - i'd have a 1.8pre build done by now
[19:17:14] <gnarf> but i ran out of ideas
[19:17:44] <DaveMethvin> sounds like a good idea mikesherov so it won't be order-dependent for landing the pulls
[19:17:51] <mikesherov> OK
[19:18:04] <gnarf> mikesherov: unless you're worried it wont land as all 3
[19:19:16] <mikesherov> Well, I mean, one is css3 vendor prefixing, 1 is use that to properly do border-box, and 1 is to use those 2 to have .css('width') return the correct border-box value and have it differ from .width()
[19:19:27] <mikesherov> All 3 were voted up for 1.8
[19:19:42] <gnarf> sounds like a logical chain of dependency :)
[19:19:56] <DaveMethvin> if it's easier mikesherov just make a note on which to land first
[19:20:00] <gnarf> it can be the triple play merge
[19:20:28] <mikesherov> Ok, I'll just make a note
[19:23:28] <mikesherov> btw, I completely rewrote pulley to work with github API v3
[19:23:53] <mikesherov> John sort of abandoned that project when github moved to v3 of their API
[19:24:04] <mikesherov> in case anyone want it
[19:24:21] <Krinkle> ?pulley
[19:24:24] <bot-t> Krinkle, #10733 (remove uses of jQuery.each in css module in favor of a for ... - Opened 5 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10733?cversion=0&cnum_hist=4
[19:24:38] <Krinkle> I'll assume that isn't it
[19:24:53] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jeresig/pulley
[19:24:56] <DaveMethvin> gnarf taught me how to be a real man and land my patches directly
[19:25:07] <mikesherov> FINE
[19:25:48] <DaveMethvin> the real reason i stopped using it was that the Windows version of node.js died on it for some strange reason
[19:25:54] <mikesherov> YES
[19:26:00] <mikesherov> And I "fixed" that
[19:26:01] <DaveMethvin> even now i can't use the most recent version
[19:26:10] <mikesherov> mine work
[19:26:13] <mikesherov> mine works*
[19:26:14] <mikesherov> on windows
[19:26:29] <mikesherov> by using setTimeout fucking everywhere
[19:26:35] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:26:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah i didn't know who to blame but it's frustrating
[19:26:58] <mikesherov> there is a weird bug with threading on windows nodejs
[19:27:13] <mikesherov> anyway, if you'd like to check it out, I have it
[19:27:19] <DaveMethvin> looking forward to the grunt build system
[19:27:26] <mikesherov> k
[19:27:37] <JohnResig> mikesherov: you right, didn't you ask for access to pulley?
[19:27:44] <mikesherov> Yeah
[19:27:50] <JohnResig> k, give me a sec
[19:27:54] <mikesherov> Oh, awesome
[19:28:03] <mikesherov> That would be amazing
[19:28:11] <JohnResig> mikesherov: done, you're an admin now
[19:28:16] <JohnResig> mikesherov: sorry for the delay!
[19:28:22] <mikesherov> Wow! Thanks John!
[19:28:30] <JohnResig> no problem, thanks for your help!
[19:28:43] <gnarf> JohnResig: shows up and hands off a project - you rule bro
[19:28:44] <gnarf> ;)
[19:28:51] <JohnResig> haha
[19:28:54] <gnarf> How's things btw JohnResig - long time no see
[19:28:59] <JohnResig> yeah, don't have much time to maintain stuff
[19:29:06] <JohnResig> gnarf: going well! Khan Academy work is going really well
[19:29:14] <mikesherov> I can imagine Kahn is keeping you busy. It's understood
[19:29:23] <JohnResig> gnarf: I'm working on developing Computer Science curriculum, using JavaScript
[19:29:34] <JohnResig> I'm hoping to release by the end of the summer, it should be pretty awesome
[19:33:13] <DaveMethvin> oh boy now i can bug mikesherov with pulley bugs!
[19:33:17] <JohnResig> hehe
[19:33:20] <mikesherov> YES
[19:33:26] <mikesherov> Challenge accepted
[19:33:45] <mikesherov> I'm just going to plop down a rebuilt version tomorrow
[19:33:55] <mikesherov> and then you can assault me with bug reports
[19:35:19] <DaveMethvin> JohnResig: You need a slogan, like "Khan Academy: You might just learn something"
[19:36:06] <DaveMethvin> Khan Acadamy: It's like college, but without the crippling debt
[19:36:13] <DaveMethvin> and beer
[19:37:35] <gnarf> JohnResig: lemme know if yoy want someone to audit your curriculum :)
[19:38:33] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: "for your first assignment, rewrite jQuery animations"
[19:38:51] <DaveMethvin> poor suckers
[19:39:03] <gnarf> lol
[19:39:13] <gnarf> i gave myself a brain ache today
[19:39:58] <gnarf> i think there were chunks of animate code leaking out of my eyeball
[19:40:32] <DaveMethvin> i've had those days
[19:51:26] <Krinkle> #11153
[19:51:30] <Krinkle> ? 11153
[19:51:31] <bot-t> [#11153] jQuery 1.7 Strips Carriage Returns in IE 8 (closed bug: fixed in v1.8) - http://jqbug.com/11153
[20:32:43] <gnarf> hrm
[20:32:50] <gnarf> darn, dave took off
[22:26:11] <matjas> gnarf: well i can’t trigger input.input, as that would remove the keydown handler :P
[22:26:14] <matjas> gnarf: good catch
[22:26:24] <matjas> can’t believe that sat there for… 10 months
[22:53:43] <gnarf> matjas: heh
[22:53:57] <gnarf> blame scott
[22:54:18] <gnarf> he brought it up because he wanted to support input event in ui
[22:55:32] <matjas> scott_gonzalez: thanks! :D
[22:55:57] <matjas> easiest way to do it that i can think of is binding the same handler to some unknown event type, then triggering that one
[22:56:13] <matjas> any other clever ideas?
[22:56:26] <matjas> (*more clever* ideas)
[22:57:42] <gnarf> yeah
[22:57:44] <gnarf> special hooks
[23:00:08] <gnarf> haven't thought it through entirely, but its gotta be similar to like "clickoutside"
[23:00:22] <gnarf> but some sort of "self removing" hook
[23:00:36] <gnarf> that once it detects you support input it stops proxying keyp
