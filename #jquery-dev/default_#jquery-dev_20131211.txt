[06:27:27] <cjqed> Hi all. I'm trying to make a QUnit test in ./test/unit/css.js, but when I go to the QUnit page I have set up on my local php server, it's just not... recognizing any changes to that file. I am able to make changes in every other page I've tried (core, manipulation, attributes, etc) and it shows up correctly (That is, changed) on the QUnit page. However, nothing I do to the css.js file will 
[06:27:28] <cjqed> register. Is there something weird about it, has anyone else ever encountered something like this?

[13:40:30] <Krinkle> Argh, spent an hour figuring out a bug with focus not bubbling inside iframes.
[13:40:44] <Krinkle> After reproducing it on jsfiddle, figured it was fixed in 1.x edge
[13:40:45] <Krinkle> http://jsfiddle.net/sw3hr/
[13:40:51] <Krinkle> Yay :)
[14:24:50] <Krinkle> Hm..  I just got a reply from a browserstack support thread, and I see that my original message was altered from when I submitted it through the web app. It got "\n\nthanks,\n<full name>\n<email>" appended.
[14:24:58] <Krinkle> They're thanking themselves, aigh?
[14:25:14] <Krinkle> lol
[14:31:56] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[14:43:25] <Krinkle> Hehe, I love that when signing up for jqcon I "decided" to use ISO date format (eventhough the e-mail contained "February 10").
[14:43:33] <Krinkle> Then I open the screenshots and see DaveMethvin did the same.
[14:43:40] <Krinkle> yay :) http://xkcd.com/1179/
