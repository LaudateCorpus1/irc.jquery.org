[06:07:21] <rwaldron> m_gol as far as I know, yes. The last thing I heard was that Allen was still working on defining where optimizations should be applied
[06:29:58] <DaveMethvin> jamesMGreene: I'm pretty sure I said Wednesday and had asked for it earlier as well ... sorry you missed it
[06:47:10] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core 1.x build #353: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201.x/353/
[06:47:49] <DaveMethvin> at this point i have no confidence in those swarm results
[06:52:48] <m_gol> this is weird
[06:53:05] <m_gol> note that not only oldIE fails (at least from time to time) on 1.x-master
[06:53:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and it's the same kind of thing where it just stops mid-tests m_gol 
[06:53:45] <DaveMethvin> possibly different causes, but who knows
[06:54:43] <m_gol> kinda hard to debug such things
[06:54:56] <DaveMethvin> esp when it seems to work fine locally
[06:56:55] <m_gol> at least IE6 & 8 fail consistently :P
[06:59:34] <DaveMethvin> that's good 8(
[07:03:19] <m_gol> well, since they pass locally, we can get RC out
[07:03:38] <DaveMethvin> assuming we can find timmywil
[07:03:43] <m_gol> haha
[07:03:45] <m_gol> there are a couple other "true" issues (Chrome & IE6)
[07:03:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah but minor
[07:04:06] <m_gol> btw, Opera 16 has some problems with itself but 18 is available on BrowserStack now so we could dump 16
[07:04:20] <m_gol> but it seems only Krinkle knows how to do that, right? ;)
[07:04:58] <DaveMethvin> are there instructions for doing that Krinkle?
[07:05:35] <m_gol> anyway, we can ignore that one for now
[07:06:17] <Krinkle> Needs to be listed on http://api.browserstack.com/2/browsers, then registered in infrastructure:/swarm/localSettings.json#userAgents, then deployed and verify using BrowserStack Live that using that browser to join the swarm works (e.g. userAgent parses in both ways by ua-parser lib and testswarm-browserstack mapping), then update swarm/localSettings.json again, this time updating the browser sets accordi
[07:06:18] <Krinkle> ngly (e.g. - Opera 16, + Opera 18)
[07:06:53] <Krinkle> The API is usually slightly behind what is available in the GUI, Opera 18 is there now though.
[07:07:28] <DaveMethvin> chrome 32 needs to come out SOON, i am pretty sure it fixes that 31 issue we are seeing
[07:07:45] <DaveMethvin> i know there was some regression they fixed
[07:08:01] <DaveMethvin> my system is kinda messed up so i can't run my local server
[07:08:08] <DaveMethvin> need to reinstall windows today
[07:08:17] <DaveMethvin> but i was waiting until we got the rc out
[07:08:37] <m_gol> yup, Chrome 32 passes effects tests locally
[07:09:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I can run tests on all supported browsers locally (except Safari <7)
[07:09:39] <m_gol> so let me know if you need them for a specific commit
[07:11:49] <DaveMethvin> markelog m_gol are we all set for 1.x-master changes then?
[07:12:05] <m_gol> there are errors on IE6
[07:12:20] <m_gol> in attributes
[07:13:25] <DaveMethvin> hmm, that's the one i thought was from the commit that hasn't landed yet :)
[07:14:20] <DaveMethvin> GAAH
[07:14:32] <DaveMethvin> windows being stupid
[07:15:18] <m_gol> but markelog landed sth attr-related
[07:16:24] <m_gol> I haven't run tests on IE6 manually for some time, I forgot how slow it is
[07:17:21] <m_gol> I forgot I don't have IE6-7 & Safari 5.1-6 locally but it works on Browserstack if I connect via a tunnel
[07:18:25] <DaveMethvin> GAH AGAIN
[07:18:40] <DaveMethvin> the test runs are not taking the latest commit
[07:18:57] <m_gol> :?
[07:18:58] <m_gol> :/
[07:19:00] <DaveMethvin> all the commits from jan 15 are being ignored
[07:19:14] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[07:20:02] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle, any ideas on why that would be? If i manually fire off a test in jenkins shouldn't it take the latest commit?
[07:20:50] * m_gol sets timer for 10 minutes to move the mouse on Browserstack
[07:21:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah m_gol that's really annoying, i was trying to debug something in ie8 a while back and kept losing the session
[07:21:39] <Krinkle> Not sure
[07:22:04] <DaveMethvin> the server was all messed up yesterday, maybe it missed some notifications
[07:22:51] <DaveMethvin> gnarf s5fs : with the probs on jq01 yesterday would that have meant the pushes to 1.x-master would have been lost?
[07:31:25] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: m_gol: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/TestSwarm#add-a-browser
[07:31:41] <m_gol> Krinkle: thanks!
[07:33:19] <DaveMethvin> thanks Krinkle ... gotta run for about 45 minutes
[07:33:52] <m_gol> my IE6 disappeared in BrowserStack :(
[07:37:54] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: not sure what you mean? "lost"? The git build might not of made it, but a forced build now should fix it
[07:48:56] <m_gol> ha, our parser library doesn't recognize IE11
[07:49:00] <m_gol> update coming...
[07:51:39] <m_gol> oh come on, BrowserStack... 5 minuts timeout?!?
[08:02:29] <m_gol> gnarf: can you force the build then?
[08:02:56] <DaveMethvin> m_gol gnarf  do you mean manually starting one from jenkins? did that a couple of hours ago
[08:03:07] <DaveMethvin> the latest commit is https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits/1.x-master
[08:03:17] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I thought the BS timeout is 15 min, not 5 :(

[08:04:47] <DaveMethvin> using the Build Now link in Jenkins
[08:05:39] <DaveMethvin> we have entered some bizarro world
[08:10:12] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: Think i got it
[08:10:16] <gnarf> it was the ?reload that was failing
[08:10:25] <gnarf> a) forgot to whitelist the new IP on netdna
[08:10:46] <gnarf> b) forgot to install submodules in codeorigin.jquery.com -- going to fix that soon
[08:10:58] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js

[08:13:44] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: still grabbed the wrong commit http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[08:13:56] <m_gol> unfortunately, the latest ua-parser from npm is old and doesn't recognize IE11
[08:13:59] <DaveMethvin> the prob may be in jenkins, i dunno
[08:14:06] <m_gol> and I'd like to add it to TestSwarm
[08:15:57] <DaveMethvin> m_gol:  i'd do it but my system is a little messed up and i'm worried about doing anything too ambitious right now until i reformat
[08:16:06] <DaveMethvin> which i will do as soon as we get the rc out
[08:16:17] <DaveMethvin> which we can do as soon as we know what's up with the latest commit
[08:16:21] <m_gol> ;)
[08:16:36] <DaveMethvin> i just LOVE computers

[10:24:38] <DaveMethvin> m_gol and markelog i don't think we can expect anything useful out of the swarm today
[10:24:43] <DaveMethvin> soooooo
[10:24:59] <DaveMethvin> how do you guys feel about RC?
[10:25:12] <DaveMethvin> i would kind of like to get it done
[10:30:36] <_markelog> DaveMethvin: oh well :-(
[10:33:44] <rwaldron> _markelog ping
[10:36:57] <_markelog> rwaldron: pong
[10:38:07] <rwaldron> _markelog regarding our discussion yesterday, Promises
[10:38:15] <_markelog> yeah?
[10:38:53] <rwaldron> I was able to confirm for you that the Promises spec deltas have been folded into the ES6 draft
[10:39:24] <rwaldron> and will be in the next draft release (barring some unforeseen issue)
[10:39:44] <_markelog> thank you rwaldron! That's very helpful
[10:40:02] <rwaldron> You can also ping Domenic_ if you have any questionsâ€”I'm sure he won't mind :)
[10:40:21] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron _markelog I'd be interested in discussing how we incorporate spec Promises in jQuery, they seem to have several downsides that can't be overcome unless they have language support
[10:40:27] <DaveMethvin> we can do that in san diego
[10:41:22] <_markelog> DaveMethvin yeah, i just wanted to confirm that promise spec will be in the next draft
[10:41:37] <DaveMethvin> even so, i wonder about the timing of our suppoet
[10:41:42] <DaveMethvin> support
[10:41:57] <DaveMethvin> like, whether we could support the shim perhaps
[10:42:24] <DaveMethvin> and then if someone did a custom build they could use just the shim
[10:42:51] <_markelog> that's one possible route we could take
[10:43:08] <_markelog> there is a lot of them :-)
[10:43:12] <DaveMethvin> TOO MANY
[10:43:13] <DaveMethvin> :)
[10:43:34] <DaveMethvin> but they all depend on supporting another 27 package managers I suspect :)))
[10:43:52] <_markelog> :-)))
[10:44:54] <_markelog> rwaldron: you confirm that with Allan?
[10:45:14] <rwaldron> I spoke to Domenic_ who has been working directly with Allen
[10:54:51] <DaveMethvin> hey _markelog ... how would you like to do the release for the RC?
[10:55:35] <_markelog> i thought timmywil had to do it?
[10:55:46] <DaveMethvin> he doesn't *have* to do it
[10:55:50] <DaveMethvin> he just did it last time
[10:55:57] <DaveMethvin> i would do it but it's breaking on windows
[10:56:05] <DaveMethvin> and my system is a little broken right now
[10:56:19] <DaveMethvin> once you run the script it will generate some changelogs
[10:56:25] <DaveMethvin> and i'll write the blog from those
[10:56:37] <_markelog> okay, is there a specific protocol i should follow?
[10:56:56] <DaveMethvin> clone the jquery-release repo to your system
[10:57:03] <DaveMethvin> the readme is pretty good
[10:57:17] <DaveMethvin> then you run the command
[10:57:25] <DaveMethvin> you can do a dry run to see how it works
[10:57:30] <DaveMethvin> to your own repo as a test
[10:57:33] <DaveMethvin> something like this
[10:57:45] <DaveMethvin> node release.js --pre-release=2.1.0-rc1 --remote=markelog/jquery
[10:57:59] <_markelog> okay, i will be able to do this in 30 min, is that okay?
[10:58:05] <DaveMethvin> sure
[10:58:12] <_markelog> all right
[10:58:16] <DaveMethvin> i was pretty surpised how slick it was

[11:55:49] <DaveMethvin> NOW HE'S A REAL MAN!
[11:56:12] <scott_gonzalez> I read that line and heard "I'm a real boy!" in the back of my head.
[11:56:19] <DaveMethvin> let's see how it looks
[11:57:26] <scott_gonzalez> Hah, the silly blank lines in package.json got removed :-)
[11:59:24] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: shouldn't those be showing on master?
[11:59:29] <DaveMethvin> i see the tag
[11:59:52] <scott_gonzalez> No, the release happens in a branch that never gets pushed.
[12:00:02] <scott_gonzalez> That way artifacts don't clutter master.
[12:00:04] <DaveMethvin> ah, right
[12:00:13] <markelog> have a problem, it seems npm responds with bad request
[12:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> During the publish?
[12:00:29] <DaveMethvin> oh you prob need some auth
[12:00:32] <markelog> yeah
[12:00:46] <DaveMethvin> well that would have borked for me too
[12:00:56] <DaveMethvin> we can push those manually
[12:01:02] <markelog> i have one in .npmrc
[12:01:07] <DaveMethvin> oh but recovery
[12:01:11] <DaveMethvin> always the fun part
[12:01:30] <DaveMethvin> how far into the process is that? do we need to really run the rest?
[12:01:37] <DaveMethvin> lemme look
[12:01:51] <scott_gonzalez> Luckily npm publishing is the last step for pre-releases.
[12:01:52] <markelog> npm publish is the last step
[12:01:57] <markelog> :-)
[12:02:00] <DaveMethvin> awesome
[12:02:07] <DaveMethvin> that makes recovery much easier! :)
[12:02:31] <DaveMethvin> altho we've never checked the build artifacts yet afaik
[12:02:36] <DaveMethvin> cdn distributions
[12:02:43] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to do this part after publishing to npm: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/build/release.js#L140
[12:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, most of that doens't happen for pre-releases :-)
[12:03:20] <DaveMethvin> we don't need those for the rc yeah
[12:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> So, yeah, looks like just npm publish.
[12:03:51] <markelog> what about 1.x?
[12:04:41] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to run the release process again.
[12:04:55] <DaveMethvin> same thing, but change the --pre-release=1.11.0-rc1
[12:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> Using --branch=1.x-master
[12:05:07] <markelog> will it try to do npm publish?
[12:05:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah, let me look for auth and i'll pm them to you
[12:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[12:05:32] <scott_gonzalez> 1.x doesn't go to npm.
[12:05:36] <DaveMethvin> oh we didn't change that yet?
[12:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[12:05:46] <DaveMethvin> we will need to publish it
[12:05:52] * DaveMethvin shakes fist at browserify
[12:05:55] <scott_gonzalez> master: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/build/release.js#L120-L121
[12:06:09] <DaveMethvin> ok then we are good to go for 1.x then
[12:06:10] <scott_gonzalez> 1.x-master: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.x-master/build/release.js#L119-L120
[12:06:41] <markelog> so all we have to do
[12:06:42] <markelog> is
[12:06:43] <markelog> npmPublish: true
[12:06:47] <markelog> right?
[12:06:54] <DaveMethvin> right
[12:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, if you're cherry-picking, here's the commit: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/ee64df82745c6bbe7a3a73bd85e79b53729d8455
[12:07:04] <DaveMethvin> actually let me see if i have those auth
[12:07:41] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer might be able to grant permission if you don't have it already.
[12:08:23] <markelog> grant permission to what?
[12:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> npm
[12:09:15] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nevermind, this isn't going to be tied to a shared auth like GitHub.
[12:10:35] <DaveMethvin> sent them over ... scott_gonzalez  we just npm adduser those?
[12:10:56] <DaveMethvin> i think i recall timmywil mentioning that as the process
[12:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:11:36] <DaveMethvin> what email should we be using for that?
[12:11:53] <DaveMethvin> i think it's gone from rick's to timmy's to whoever committed ast
[12:11:54] <DaveMethvin> last
[12:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You'd use your own email.
[12:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> Each peron would have their own npm user.
[12:12:20] <scott_gonzalez> And then you'd `npm owner add` each of them to the package.
[12:12:27] <DaveMethvin> oh
[12:12:30] <markelog> yeah, but don't do that
[12:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> `npm owner add dave jquery`
[12:12:49] <markelog> we have only jquery user as a maintainer
[12:12:56] <scott_gonzalez> That's silly.
[12:13:04] <markelog> i guess :-)
[12:13:04] <scott_gonzalez> Who decided to do that?
[12:13:14] <DaveMethvin> whoever started it i guess
[12:13:20] <DaveMethvin> i am not familiar with npm's process
[12:13:24] <markelog> all right i just publish it
[12:14:02] <markelog> now 1.x
[12:14:26] <DaveMethvin> so does the script refresh the cdn scott_gonzalez ?
[12:15:03] <DaveMethvin> I think i should be seeing http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0-rc1.js
[12:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/7
[12:15:48] <DaveMethvin> ah ok
[12:16:14] <DaveMethvin> didn't the refresh used to require a pull from codeorigin.jquery.com anyway? which now we've whitelisted only a few ips for that
[12:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:16:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^
[12:16:46] <DaveMethvin> it's always something :)
[12:17:14] <scott_gonzalez> always

[12:24:10] <gnarf> i already did it
[12:24:23] <scott_gonzalez> Is the reload whitelisted?
[12:24:30] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/2a320o1e2R2t
[12:24:37] <DaveMethvin> so should 1.11.0-rc1 be there now as well?
[12:24:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: meaning?
[12:24:48] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: might need to do some manual ?reloads
[12:24:57] <gnarf> i did them for 2.1.0
[12:25:13] <gnarf> basically take whatever url isn't giving you the right output
[12:25:18] <gnarf> add "origin" and ?reload
[12:25:31] <gnarf> and if you want to see what is on codeorigin
[12:25:37] <gnarf> add "origin" and "?view"
[12:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...now it's working for me.
[12:25:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:25:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that was broken in the move 
[12:26:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/8 
[12:26:17] <gnarf> fixed about 4 hrs ago
[12:26:39] <scott_gonzalez> Can we do this? https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/7
[12:26:47] <scott_gonzalez> Just send an automated reload on the listing pages.
[12:27:03] <gnarf> curl http://{{deployhost}}/index/?reload

[12:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> Can you add that to the deploy script?
[12:27:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: just need to add a grunt task to do it
[12:27:43] <gnarf> it runs grunt deploy
[12:28:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i might be able to add it to the post-receive, but its a template that deploys every site
[12:29:07] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll see if there's a a good way to do this from grunt.
[12:29:07] <DaveMethvin> markelog: did it bail out on you because the authors were out of sync?
[12:29:09] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery01] 15markelog tagged 061.11.0-rc1 at 145c62f3c: 02http://git.io/Eeiodg

[12:29:09] <gnarf> adding some extra commands over "grunt deploy" doesn't make sense
[12:29:19] <scott_gonzalez> Probalby just need to redefine the deploy task.
[12:29:20] <markelog> DaveMethvin: yep,
[12:29:29] <DaveMethvin> see, the authors check would be one that i'd like to see front-loaded, to avoid a bailout
[12:29:30] <markelog> pretty cool
[12:29:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you just need to fire (number of pages changed) http requests and wait for them to tell you if they worked
[12:29:38] <gnarf> :)
[12:29:55] <DaveMethvin> polling at its best :)
[12:30:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah this release script is pretty awesome
[12:30:41] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[12:30:52] <scott_gonzalez> It'll get better over time too.
[12:31:03] <markelog> yeah, basically only you have to do is run one command
[12:31:03] <DaveMethvin> it's like watching some amazingly complex machine lumber across the landscape, with dramatic music behind it
[12:31:10] <DaveMethvin> we do need the music, scott_gonzalez 
[12:31:16] <DaveMethvin> can we add a spotify hook?
[12:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> hehe
[12:31:26] <markelog> :-)))
[12:31:29] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub is writing about jQuery performance: https://github.com/blog/1756-optimizing-large-selector-sets
[12:31:51] <gnarf> btw DaveMethvin : 1.11.0-rc1 isn't pushed to the codeorigin yet?
[12:32:17] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[12:32:38] <DaveMethvin> it was tagged a few minutes ago, would think it's there now?
[12:32:45] <DaveMethvin> markelog did it finish?
[12:32:56] <gnarf> it might not of pushed to codeorigin ?
[12:33:00] <markelog> at cdn step
[12:33:05] <gnarf> :)
[12:33:47] <DaveMethvin> see the music should be reaching a crescendo about now
[12:34:39] <scott_gonzalez> "I've got 99 problems and deploying is one"
[12:36:23] <gnarf> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.0-rc1.js
[12:36:50] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder how big this would be if it were part of core: https://github.com/josh/jquery-selector-set/blob/master/jquery.selector-set.js
[12:37:12] <DaveMethvin> probably not that big, a lot of it is the monkey patching
[12:37:45] <DaveMethvin> actually the jsperf is the interesting part, it's good to see something based on a real page
[12:38:09] <scott_gonzalez> We should ask them what hooks they would need publish support for to avoid patching jQuery.
[12:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> s/publish/public/
[12:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> Because even after the monkey patching, you still need to load all of this: https://github.com/josh/selector-set/blob/master/selector-set.js
[12:38:48] <DaveMethvin> also need to be sure they haven't made simplifying assumptions we can't make
[12:39:15] <DaveMethvin> oh ugh
[12:39:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, they need stuff we can't sanely expose: https://github.com/josh/jquery-selector-set/blob/master/jquery.selector-set.js#L93-L96
[12:39:59] <DaveMethvin> well like i said, the jsperf is the most interesting part to me
[12:40:12] <DaveMethvin> if there is a perf bottleneck in delegated events, we can look at fixing it
[12:40:14] <markelog> npm still bailed on me at npm publish
[12:40:19] <markelog> with
[12:40:19] <markelog> npm ERR! registry error parsing json
[12:40:28] <markelog> had to do it manually again
[12:40:34] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[12:40:38] <DaveMethvin> wonder why that was
[12:40:47] <markelog> yeah me too
[12:40:51] <DaveMethvin> okay, instant postmortem
[12:41:00] <DaveMethvin> the npm publish needs work
[12:41:26] <DaveMethvin> also do we want to do the npm credentials differently? scott_gonzalez was proposing separate users
[12:41:30] <DaveMethvin> which does seem better
[12:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> We should definitely do separate users.
[12:41:38] <DaveMethvin> otherwise we have to pass this stuff around
[12:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> We're already doing that for all of our other projects.
[12:41:47] <markelog> yeah, i think it's right way
[12:41:51] <DaveMethvin> ok good
[12:42:42] <DaveMethvin> but the npm publish is still broken :)
[12:43:10] <scott_gonzalez> Was the error in our code or with the actual npm registry?
[12:43:53] <markelog> the last one
[12:44:02] <markelog> npm http 400 https://registry.npmjs.org/jquery/-/jquery-1.11.0-rc1.tgz/-rev/69-d0617fae0f05f5acb066e003d31b9e67
[12:44:02] <markelog> npm ERR! registry error parsing json
[12:44:02] <markelog> npm ERR! publish Error uploading package
[12:44:02] <markelog> npm ERR! SyntaxError: Unexpected token
[12:44:06] <DaveMethvin> markelog: can you send me the changelog and authors?
[12:45:08] <markelog> sec
[12:45:18] <DaveMethvin> np
[12:49:19] <markelog> DaveMethvin: how do i generate those?
[12:49:37] <DaveMethvin> they should have been created as part of the build
[12:49:42] <DaveMethvin> if not i can do them manually
[12:49:52] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: where is the changelog and authors list usually put?
[12:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> markelog: Check the output from the script, it will tell you where the files are.
[12:50:12] <DaveMethvin> all 25,000 lines :)
[12:50:31] <scott_gonzalez> They should just be in the base directory from the release.
[12:50:54] <scott_gonzalez> So, __release/changelog
[12:50:58] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i am wondering if just putting back quickIs would make this fast enough, we took it out in 1.8
[12:51:14] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/713cc8609637a943f77039726d96f5e9f7a36f2b#diff-031bb62d959e7e4949d1847c82507f33L7
[12:51:20] <scott_gonzalez> We should find someone at GitHub to work with.
[12:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling that they do more complex selectors than quickIs handled.
[12:51:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah i wouldn't land a huge amount of code to fix this, but now that i have a jsperf i can see what putting back quickis would do
[12:51:58] <DaveMethvin> you can look at their selectors
[12:52:01] <DaveMethvin> most are just class
[12:52:08] <markelog> scott_gonzalez: they not there
[12:52:17] <markelog> for both master and 1.x
[12:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> markelog: Can you paste the output of the release script?
[12:52:44] <DaveMethvin> maybe the final cleanup removes them?
[12:53:10] <DaveMethvin> i haven't ever used the output and when timmy ran it last time i had already built it manually
[12:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> There shouldn't be any cleanup script that gets run.
[12:53:36] <markelog> maybe they not there because of the npm failure?
[12:54:43] <markelog> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/markelog/bd3f5aaabd4d610d6d4a
[12:55:09] <DaveMethvin> that's in stabletasks
[12:55:12] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this came up before.
[12:55:14] <DaveMethvin> so i guess it doesn't run for prelease
[12:55:16] <DaveMethvin> right
[12:55:17] <scott_gonzalez> UI never did this for pre-releases.
[12:55:30] <scott_gonzalez> We can move it out of the stable-only section.
[12:55:48] <DaveMethvin> it wouldn't hurt to do it every time
[12:55:54] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/issues/28
[12:56:54] <jqcommit> [13jquery-release] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #28: Always create changelog and contributor list 02http://git.io/iQNzRg
[12:57:55] <DaveMethvin> i'll just generate the changelog via the old release script, that's no problem
[12:58:00] <DaveMethvin> and save the authors for the final
[12:58:09] <markelog> okay
[12:58:12] <markelog> and that's it i suppose
[12:58:27] <DaveMethvin> the music reaches a climax!
[12:58:28] <markelog> i'm man now
[12:58:31] <markelog>  :-)
[12:58:33] <DaveMethvin> a REAL man!
[12:58:36] <DaveMethvin> thanks markelog
