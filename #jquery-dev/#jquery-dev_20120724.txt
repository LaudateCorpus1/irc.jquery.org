[05:39:16] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by Scott González (9m, 11s ago): Tagging the 1.8.22 release.
[05:39:48] <DaveMethvin> FINALLY! Now I can land that complete rewrite to our focus handling scott_gonzalez
[05:39:55] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[05:40:00] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[05:40:10] <DaveMethvin> we'll try not to break anything
[05:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> It takes a while to do the full release, especially since 1.8.x sitll deals with SVN.
[05:40:35] <scott_gonzalez> But it'll be done today, hopefully by lunch.
[05:40:38] * DaveMethvin shudders
[05:41:05] <scott_gonzalez> I should really run the `svn commit`s through `time`. It takes multiple minutes to commit.
[05:41:32] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[05:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1m201m430W1o and still going...
[05:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> We commit a LOT of files.
[05:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, it's done. And I shrunk my terminal down to 80 characters for perspective. http://cl.ly/image/3t0t171b2N1j
[05:48:29] <DaveMethvin> thems a lotta dots
[05:48:50] <DaveMethvin> i'll never complain about git again

[06:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Should I just delete the code.origin.jquery.com line from the known_hosts?
[07:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: http://blog.jqueryui.com/?p=1029&preview=true
[07:37:20] <DaveMethvin> i can't see previews on blog.jqueryui.com scott_gonzalez, not sure i have a login at all
[07:37:43] <scott_gonzalez> let me check
[07:38:01] <DaveMethvin> it would be my gmail, it didn't have that as a user
[07:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'll create an account. What do you want for your username?
[07:39:41] <scott_gonzalez> This will probably only last a month or so, since we're redoing all the sites :-P
[07:40:05] <DaveMethvin> dmethvin would be good, thanks
[07:43:27] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: looks good
[07:44:31] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[09:34:27] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: ben_alman had a suggestion about changing the URLs in licenses field in package.json.
[09:34:55] <scott_gonzalez> The URL would point to the GitHub URL for the actual license in master.
[09:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> During a release, we would change the URL to point at the tag.
[09:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> So the info is actually correct (contains our name and the year).
[10:21:50] <ajpiano> did something happen to trac
[10:22:37] <ajpiano> had to also do a forgotten password
