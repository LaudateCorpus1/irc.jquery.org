[05:18:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, it's temp01
[05:23:17] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You should ask in #node.js about node-waf on Windows.
[05:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Could you use some help on the learn site?
[05:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> I've got someone asking which project would be best for them to contribute to right now.
[05:36:59] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: looked around and can't see anyone who's gotten node-waf on windows
[05:37:05] <DaveMethvin> what is richard doing then?
[05:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> He's not on Windows.
[05:37:28] <DaveMethvin> oh, i got the impression he was
[05:37:30] <scott_gonzalez> He abandoned you like a year ago.
[05:37:41] * DaveMethvin cried
[05:38:00] <DaveMethvin> the best long-term solution for node is to use grunt, of course
[05:38:03] <DaveMethvin> :)
[05:38:13] <DaveMethvin> but that doesn't solve our (my) near-term problem
[05:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> You tried `node-gyp configure`?
[05:40:05] <DaveMethvin> i don't have node-gyp
[05:40:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ask in #node.js?
[05:40:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah, just got an answer to try node-gyp
[05:40:30] <gibson042> I've done a lot on Windows, but haven't yet got the grunt process to work
[05:40:42] <DaveMethvin> so i have to figure out where that is
[05:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: jzaefferer has grunt working on Windows.
[05:41:18] <scott_gonzalez> He successfully ran a build of jQuery UI the other day in a Windows VM.
[05:41:33] <DaveMethvin> you have to say grunt.cmd
[05:41:40] <DaveMethvin> or alias grunt to that
[05:41:56] <DaveMethvin> i have the jquery core build stuff working fine
[05:42:17] <gibson042> yes, I haven't been on that PC since finding out about grunt.cmd
[05:42:40] <gibson042> I'll probably give it another shot within a week
[05:53:27] <DaveMethvin> well i have node-gyp installed, now all i need to do is install a different version of Python and figure out why it can't see Microsoft Visual C++ on my path
[05:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Check your email :-)
[05:56:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah, saw that scott_gonzalez
[05:57:41] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[05:57:55] <DaveMethvin> our long national nightmare is over
[05:59:53] <DaveMethvin> please come back bot-t!
[06:04:39] <DaveMethvin> so, scott_gonzalez, i have completed the 5 minute install i started on Monday :)  what was it i was going to do once i had this installed again?
[06:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:05:10] <DaveMethvin> well the wordpress stuff was actually much less than 5 min
[06:05:11] <scott_gonzalez> Setup config.json to point at your WP install.
[06:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> There should be a sample config file in the root.
[06:05:44] <DaveMethvin> think i've got that done, lemme check
[06:06:04] <DaveMethvin> oh one of the other things that happened is that my editor setup file got corrupted in a reboot, still have to fix that
[06:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, if you've got config.json setup, then you should be able to run `grunt wordpress-deploy`
[06:09:57] <DaveMethvin> Error: Cannot find module 'hooker'
[06:10:30] <DaveMethvin> grunt with no args gives the same error
[06:10:40] <DaveMethvin> if i switch to jquery and grunt it's ok
[06:10:47] <DaveMethvin> so it has to be something in this project
[06:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> What does `npm ls` show?
[06:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna do a clean `npm install` for api.jquery.com and see if I get the same problem.
[06:13:27] <DaveMethvin> a bunch of unmet dependencies
[06:13:36] <DaveMethvin> including hooker
[06:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> try `npm install` again
[06:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> Did you run that after the last `git pull`?
[06:14:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah it does nothing
[06:14:15] <DaveMethvin> no output
[06:14:18] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[06:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> rm -rf node_modules
[06:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> npm install
[06:17:52] <DaveMethvin> so i'd call that progress, scott_gonzalez, it worked up to the wordpress-sync task
[06:17:58] <DaveMethvin> what's the format of that url?
[06:18:24] <scott_gonzalez> It's the URL of where WordPress is installed.
[06:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> It can be as short as a domain name or as long as a full URL.
[06:18:49] <DaveMethvin> ok that's what i couldn't tell from the template
[06:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> so "api.jquery.com" and "http://api.jquery.com" and "http://api.jquery.com:80" are all valid.
[06:19:43] <DaveMethvin> ok, seems i have to enable xml-rpc services...
[06:20:12] <scott_gonzalez> Log in, then under Settings -> Writing there's a checkbox at the bottom.
[06:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> This will happen automatically when you're using web-base-template.
[06:21:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you're going to need the WP extensions if you're not using web-base-tempalte yet.
[06:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> You can just copy the mu-plugins directory from web-base-tempalte into your WP install.
[06:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> It goes in the wp-conent directory.
[06:22:34] <DaveMethvin> so it may be faster to get web-base-template then?
[06:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> It depends :-P
[06:23:00] <DaveMethvin> i feel kind of bad because it's unlikely i could ever reproduce these steps to help anyone else get through this
[06:23:17] <DaveMethvin> it's just a random walk through error messages .. :P
[06:23:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to work with nacin this week to make the process simpler.
[06:23:59] <DaveMethvin> so does the wordpress sync task want my local wordpress username/password? Or does it want the mysql password?
[06:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> WP user/pass.
[06:24:30] <DaveMethvin> for my local wordpress setup, right?
[06:26:00] <DaveMethvin> ok that has it going
[06:27:14] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[06:28:04] <DaveMethvin> well i jinxed it
[06:28:05] <DaveMethvin> >> Error processing category Uncategorized.
[06:28:05] <DaveMethvin> >> Error: XML-RPC fault: A term with the name provided already exists with this
[06:28:05] <DaveMethvin> parent.
[06:28:40] <scott_gonzalez> So that's a problem with the repo itself.
[06:29:38] <scott_gonzalez> Log into WordPress and find the Uncategorized category.
[06:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to get this fixed in the repo, but getting WordPress to match the repo for now will work.
[06:30:34] <DaveMethvin> so what should i do with Uncategorized?
[06:31:01] <scott_gonzalez> Is the slug all lowercase?
[06:31:10] <DaveMethvin> yep
[06:31:29] <scott_gonzalez> Change it to Uncategorized.
[06:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why Richard has it in the repo capitalized.
[06:32:19] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ?
[06:32:30] <DaveMethvin> it won't change, still lowercase
[06:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[06:33:18] <DaveMethvin> there's always mysql :D
[06:33:31] <scott_gonzalez> ok, let's change it in the repo.
[06:33:55] <scott_gonzalez>  /dist/wordpress/taxonomies.json
[06:34:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's the first item.
[06:34:18] <rworth> are you on latest DaveMethvin ? Did you get my email?
[06:34:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:34:33] <rworth> cool
[06:34:38] <DaveMethvin> we're past that and the next 3 errors :)
[06:36:02] <DaveMethvin> deploy restarted
[06:37:07] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: It's going to fail again.
[06:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry :-/
[06:37:23] <scott_gonzalez> You need to `grunt wordpress-syn` after changing taxonomies.json.
[06:37:29] <DaveMethvin> oh
[06:37:31] <scott_gonzalez> The deploy is going to regenerate taxonomies.json.
[06:37:36] <DaveMethvin> lol
[06:37:42] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't look at where that was going done yet.
[06:38:54] <DaveMethvin> do i need --force? it says Required task "wordpress-validate" missing
[06:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right.
[06:40:22] <DaveMethvin> basically i am just tryna skip the build steps where it is going to regen the json file, right?
[06:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> grunt wordpress-publish
[06:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> right
[06:40:45] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry, so many tasks.
[06:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> wordpress-publish = wordpress-validate + wordpress-sync
[06:41:07] <scott_gonzalez> wordpress-deploy = build-wordpress + wordpress-publish
[06:41:53] <rworth> back to your questions scott_gonzalez I have it capitalized caus that's the default
[06:42:13] <DaveMethvin> the slug seems to be pretty forcefully lowercased
[06:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> The default is a capitalized slug?
[06:42:22] <DaveMethvin> the ui won't even let me uppercasify it
[06:42:22] <rworth> yeah. weird, huh
[06:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> How would DaveMethvin have it lowercase then?
[06:42:39] <rworth> mmmm, he's one Windows?
[06:42:45] <rworth> maybe we're not on the same version of WP?
[06:42:47] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, blame it on that :P
[06:42:49] <rworth> haha
[06:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> Mine is lowercase.
[06:42:57] <rworth> hmmm
[06:43:08] <rworth> let me get onto latest master WP
[06:43:31] <DaveMethvin> well it got past uncategorized this time
[06:44:18] <DaveMethvin> awww Error: XML-RPC fault: server error. requested method gw.getPostPaths does not exist
[06:45:22] <rworth> do you have web-base-template ?
[06:45:29] <DaveMethvin> not atm
[06:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> Did you copy mu-plugins?
[06:45:44] <DaveMethvin> one step at a time
[06:45:55] <DaveMethvin> so, now that i got this far, which approach would you suggest?
[06:46:01] <DaveMethvin> pulling down web-base-template?
[06:46:12] <rworth> yeah, that'll replace the wp-content folder
[06:46:26] <scott_gonzalez> I should also release grunt-wordpress 0.1.1 soon.
[06:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> It would fail immediately telling you that the XML-RPC extension was missing.
[06:46:45] <rworth> but if you want to be able to do a clean git pull to get the latest WP, you'll want it in a different location, like a folder level up
[06:46:54] <DaveMethvin> okay, when you say  that'll replace the wp-content folder is it like a submodule?
[06:47:20] <rworth> no, we leave the wordpress folder from WP github untouched
[06:47:26] <scott_gonzalez> Simplest for now is to just replace wp-content.
[06:47:30] <rworth> indeed
[06:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Don't complicate this for him.
[06:47:43] <rworth> forget we still need some more help from nacin to get this going clean
[06:47:44] <rworth> yeh
[06:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> He can get it setup properly after nacin and I simplify the setup.
[06:47:56] <rworth> DaveMethvin rimraf the contents of wp-content
[06:48:06] <rworth> put the contents of web-base-template into wp-content
[06:48:17] <DaveMethvin> okay
[06:49:15] <DaveMethvin> gotta clone web-base-template
[06:50:04] <scott_gonzalez> umm...what? https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/commit/ac29e225fa3e05921de2e8b2970850d2e015d12b#commitcomment-1365942
[06:50:04] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on plugins.jquery.com by scottgonzalez (2m, 15h ago): Added documentation on plugin names and name reserveration process. Fixes #7.
[06:51:59] <DaveMethvin> sorry guys i'll have to finish this later, i have a 10am meeting
[06:52:36] <rworth> scott_gonzalez can I respond?
[06:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Please do.
[06:53:34] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery-data-replace doesn't extend jQuery, but it's a jQuery plugin.
[07:18:28] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I just created a brand new site and it has 1 category - name: Uncategorized, slug: Uncategorized
[07:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> You've got a crazy setup.
[07:19:00] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: What's the deal with Uncategorized? ^^
[07:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Give up. Just stop arguing with him.
[07:41:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's not worth it.
[07:46:10] <rworth> scott_gonzalez ok, I'm done
[07:46:12] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: rworth yeah, seems like it's time for "Agree to disagree" which translates to "Prefix with jquery. or it's not in. Bye!"
[07:46:32] <scott_gonzalez> seriously
[09:56:24] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: WP creates an 'Uncategorized' category by default. normally its slug would be 'uncategorized' but your filter allowing uppercase letters prevents that.
[09:58:03] <scott_gonzalez> So rworth has it captialized because he setup his site after setting up web-base-template.
[10:04:16] <nacin> yes
[13:22:01] <scott_gonzalez> oh boy http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11806#comment:1
