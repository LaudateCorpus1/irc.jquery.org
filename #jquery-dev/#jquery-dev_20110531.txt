[03:52:38] <AzaToth> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#animated ← try moving the dialog before it's animation is completed ツ
[03:53:04] <AzaToth> define it as "bug" or "too much work to ever be fixable"?
[04:12:42] <jzaefferer> those two aren't exclusive :-)
[04:15:26] <jzaefferer> anyone around who can tell me how the animated spinning loading icon works in jQuery Mobile? all I find is the non-animated png (themes/default/images/ajax-loader.png)
[07:39:14] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil, what do you think of this request: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-traversal-functions-should-conform-to-standard-css-selectors
[07:39:43] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately we documented .selector and now people expect it to actually work
[07:39:51] <DaveMethvin> but it cannot work
[07:40:08] <timmywil> we documented it?
[07:40:12] <timmywil> well woops :P
[07:40:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah i don't know when
[07:41:05] <DaveMethvin> http://api.jquery.com/selector/
[07:41:26] <DaveMethvin> "This property contains a string representing the matched set of elements, but if DOM traversal methods have been called on the object, the string may not be a valid jQuery selector expression. For this reason, the value of .selector is generally most useful immediately following the original creation of the object. "
[07:41:57] <timmywil> Oh that doesn't seem that bad then
[07:42:03] <timmywil> "may not be a valid jQuery selector"
[07:42:03] <DaveMethvin> sounds like it is working as documented  --- broken
[07:42:22] <DaveMethvin> but this guy is asking, somewhat reasonably on the surface, for it to work better
[07:42:27] <DaveMethvin> but his examples are broken
[07:42:38] <DaveMethvin> $('elem').eq(0) - "elem.slice(0,1)" - could be "elem:nth-child(0)"
[07:42:48] <DaveMethvin> but that's not true
[07:43:01] <timmywil> no it's not
[07:43:11] <DaveMethvin> and unfortunately we'd have to add a bunch of code to each traversal/selector method to get the selector right
[07:43:18] <timmywil> but is that even possible?  we can't remove the traversal functions names right?
[07:43:37] <DaveMethvin> well i'm certain it could be done
[07:44:01] <DaveMethvin> but it seems like a lot of work to still not be able to get things right in the general case
[07:44:03] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I asked John about something similar a month ago. http://oksoclap.com/EBAWZmnQ39
[07:44:29] <DaveMethvin> i think the only place we use it is in .live()
[07:44:45] <DaveMethvin> and that's why we suggest not doing traversal methods before .live
[07:45:07] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: except .find(), which will work
[07:45:58] <rwaldron> timmywil how goes
[07:45:58] <bot-t> (30 hours 20 mins ago) <miketaylr> tell rwaldron don't feed the trolls.
[07:46:02] <timmywil> kswedberg: I think he means the selector property
[07:46:16] <timmywil> rwaldron: hi!
[07:46:22] <DaveMethvin> as long as it's a selector ... find(object) or find(element) won't
[07:46:25] <rwaldron> :D
[07:46:45] <rwaldron> timmywil so, I'm just as curious as the OP regarding docs#9468
[07:46:46] <bot-t> [#9468] $('form').attr('class') always return undefined in IE 6 (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/9468
[07:46:46] <kswedberg> timmywil: ok. sorry, just jumped in because I thought it was somewhat related.
[07:47:10] <timmywil> rwaldron: he's right, but it's a duplicate that I already fixed
[07:47:17] <timmywil> looking for the ticket now
[07:47:17] <rwaldron> word
[07:47:24] <rwaldron> ok, i was just curious
[07:47:30] <timmywil> np
[07:47:37] <rwaldron> i'll wait for the ticke tto update and read the orig
[07:47:41] <rwaldron> no big deal.
[07:49:24] <timmywil> having trouble finding it...
[07:49:32] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: i think .selector is a property we shoudl take underground again, it's not reliable enough and bound to create these kind of questions
[07:49:47] <kswedberg> so, just unpublish it?
[07:49:54] <DaveMethvin> this guy wants to use it in a plugin but it won't always have a valid selector .. he's just identified a few cases where we could improve
[07:49:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah, unpublish
[07:50:09] <timmywil> agreed
[07:50:16] <kswedberg> yeah.
[07:50:28] <DaveMethvin> i was kind of surprised we had documented it
[07:50:38] <DaveMethvin> i was gonna say "it's undocumented" but then i checked ... ")
[07:51:04] <timmywil> rwaldron: maybe that's something I figured out without a ticket
[07:51:54] * rwaldron shrugs
[07:52:07] <timmywil> i'll just say fixed
[07:57:26] <timmywil> rwaldron: pretty excited about this one...see it yet?  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/fb3647f6558fddd8f05416b8a166e66b117244c5  Fiddle example in the commit message.
[07:58:09] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin, timmywil: I just unpublished it.
[07:58:28] <timmywil> kswedberg: cool
[07:58:37] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: yay! that will confuse the heck out of that guy i guess but we can explain why
[07:58:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: check out the above :D
[08:00:02] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: we documented it in jQuery 1.4 Reference Guide, which you tech reviewed, so it's partly your fault! :D
[08:00:24] <rwaldron> timmywil nice one dude
[08:00:25] <timmywil> haha
[08:00:25] <rwaldron> :)
[08:00:47] <timmywil> rwaldron: woot :)
[08:04:14] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin, timmywil: what about http://api.jquery.com/context/ ? Should that remain documented?
[08:04:59] <timmywil> heh, forgot that was there
[08:05:10] <timmywil> seems ok to leave tho
[08:05:37] <kswedberg> ok
[08:06:01] <timmywil> context should be unaffected going through traversal methods at least
[08:07:33] <timmywil> I mean, in terms of adding "parent()" or something.  I would suspect it's still an element.
[08:14:48] <DaveMethvin> sorry, off on a conf call but i'll be back
[08:26:17] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin, i'd like to talk to you about our discussion regarding http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7389
[08:26:21] <ben_alman> when you have a sec
[08:45:22] <DaveMethvin> so ben_alman ... docs#7389
[08:45:24] <bot-t> [#7389] change .selector property into .selectors array (assigned enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/7389
[08:46:17] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we want something like that
[08:46:45] <DaveMethvin> jQuery is about "find elements and do something with them" but it seems like that encourages selecting for the side effect of getting the selector
[08:46:55] <DaveMethvin> It's exactly why $().live() is strange  ... i don't think we want to encourage others to do that
[08:47:07] <ben_alman> right
[08:47:13] <ben_alman> but remember we talked about it
[08:47:21] <ben_alman> and then made a suggestion to john
[08:47:43] <DaveMethvin> uh... my memory fails
[08:47:49] <ben_alman> ok let me try to remember
[08:47:52] <DaveMethvin> lol
[08:48:25] <DaveMethvin> the reason .selector appeared originally was to support .live which is a strike against it already
[08:48:34] <rwaldron> JohnResig apparently the domain reg for ejohn.org has expired
[08:48:37] <rwaldron> just a heads uo
[08:48:38] <rwaldron> up*
[08:48:44] <JohnResig> rwaldron: already fixed
[08:48:47] <ben_alman> one idea was to either remove .selector completely once a traversal/filtering operation is done, so that it only exists on a "just created" collection, returned from $() (so that live would only work if no traversals were done)
[08:48:55] <rwaldron> nice... clears cache
[08:49:03] <ben_alman> or to always pass it through, never modifying it after the initial selection
[08:49:07] <ben_alman> that was ONE idea
[08:49:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah i could get into that
[08:49:34] <DaveMethvin> it would prevent people from misusing it
[08:49:38] <ben_alman> another part of that was to remove the 3rd argument from $.fn.pushStack because is it ever really useful?
[08:49:50] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah now it's coming back
[08:50:12] <ben_alman> and then another was to take the 2nd (and possibly 3rd) args to .pushStack and create a new debugging property
[08:50:13] <DaveMethvin> i am for anything that removes code!
[08:50:23] <ben_alman> that's NOT .selector
[08:50:30] <ben_alman> but imo the debugging property is just not needed
[08:50:53] <DaveMethvin> i still would love to see some better debuging/diags but man it seems like it should be done as a plugin
[08:50:55] <ben_alman> and .pushStack could just accept the 1 argument
[08:51:04] <ben_alman> ie, the new collection
[08:51:17] <ben_alman> so that was what we brainstormed
[08:51:40] <ben_alman> neither of us made it into a ticket
[08:51:42] <ben_alman> heh
[08:51:47] <ben_alman> but i think we should explore it
[08:52:01] <DaveMethvin> how about i create a ticket now?
[08:52:05] <ben_alman> yay
[08:52:16] <ben_alman> this is my 1st day back from over a week away
[08:52:21] <ben_alman> so i'm still catching up on emails
[08:52:53] <timmywil> no meeting this week?
[08:53:07] <DaveMethvin> since yesterday was a holiday i guess not
[08:53:20] <timmywil> kk
[08:53:54] <ben_alman> also fwiw i don't think i have the ability to vote on features
[08:54:05] <ben_alman> i got the email, saw the list, but had no voting options
[08:54:55] <timmywil> JohnResig can fix that
[08:56:03] <JohnResig> ben_alman: can you close tickets?
[08:56:30] * rwaldron giving ben_alman premissions
[08:56:36] <ben_alman> hmmn
[08:56:38] <JohnResig> what's his username?
[08:56:43] <ben_alman> cowboy
[08:56:52] <rwaldron> looks like he can already
[08:57:02] <rwaldron> ticket_admin
[08:57:13] <ben_alman> maybe i missed it in the voting page
[08:57:19] <ben_alman> it seemed all screwed up visually
[08:57:29] <JohnResig> ben_alman: you need to shift+reload
[08:57:35] <ben_alman> let me try
[08:57:38] <JohnResig> your CSS is probably cached
[08:57:43] <ben_alman> DAMN CSS
[08:57:45] <JohnResig> err, JS, I mean
[09:02:05] <ben_alman> hmmn
[09:02:12] <ben_alman> i did shift-cmd-r ?
[09:02:34] <JohnResig> ben_alman: your username is 'cowboy', right?
[09:02:51] <ben_alman> HAHA i'm not logged in
[09:02:53] <ben_alman> christ
[09:03:09] <rwaldron> bwahahahahahaha
[09:03:11] <ben_alman> i need sleep
[09:03:32] <timmywil> lol
[09:05:59] <ben_alman> JohnResig, i know you created jQuery, but do you know how to use it? http://gyazo.com/dd5df9ad7d5c18ea0b13e7578f782330.png
[09:06:29] <ben_alman> (that was for rwaldron)
[09:06:31] <rwaldron> hahahahahah
[09:07:01] <ben_alman> http://gyazo.com/c463e8c61d36929f776dc5ded1d3d85f.png
[09:07:18] <ben_alman> JohnResig, i have a plugin you might want to try http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[09:07:36] <ben_alman> (i must've double-clicked the link, for some reason)
[09:13:00] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: docs#9469
[09:13:01] <bot-t> ben_alman, [#9469] Remove semi-functional .selector calculation from .pushStack() (new enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/9469
[09:13:42] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin, looks great
[09:14:04] <DaveMethvin> good, that means lunch
[10:30:12] <Dr4g> browser bug or well Chrome Windows has new functionality
[10:30:25] <Dr4g> .hide() or .show() on an <option> tag doesn't work apart from Chrome Win
[10:30:35] <Dr4g> so i'm working around it to set them as disabled
[10:30:46] <Dr4g> maybe something to raise awareness of? if it's useful
[10:31:08] <Dr4g> and i'm happy to log this as a ticket on the bug tracker if someone thinks we (jquery) can do something about it
[10:31:11] <ajpiano> IIRC that's a known thing
[10:31:22] <ajpiano> i had to battle it when doing filtering in select
[10:31:51] <kswedberg> yeah, this is known but nothing we can do.
[10:33:16] <Dr4g> ok karl thanks
[10:33:41] <Dr4g> we may have to add/remove dom elements to filter a select list
[10:33:53] <Dr4g> which is hacky as hell but like you said, vendor issue
[10:33:54] <kswedberg> sure, Dr4g. yeah, that's what I do.
[10:34:02] <Dr4g> any code donation? :)
[10:34:13] <Dr4g> Dropdown #1 changes the values on Dropdown #2
[10:34:21] <Dr4g> dorpdown #2 must change dynamically
[10:36:33] <kswedberg> Dr4g: I'll PM you.
[10:36:41] <Dr4g> cheers mate
[10:37:49] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin, http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9469#comment:2
[12:54:25] <sean`> i before e except after c
[13:28:58] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin
[13:29:06] <ben_alman> did you see my comment / gist ?
[14:36:36] <rgbworld> Does jqueryui have a cellrender callback function yet?
[14:37:24] <rgbworld> oops sorry, jqueryui with datepicker
[14:38:02] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[14:39:12] <DaveMethvin> yep
[14:39:16] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron:
[14:39:27] <rwaldron> how accurate is sIEve?
[14:39:47] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure ...
[14:40:09] <rwaldron> i'm testing with jquery git version, and its reporting the things that i predicted I would see
[14:40:18] <DaveMethvin> like?
[14:41:16] <rwaldron> the things that arent being nulled in support
[14:41:24] <rwaldron> one of the inputs is nulled
[14:42:18] <rwaldron> but, select, input, the fake body
[14:42:38] <DaveMethvin> k, so these are leaks from the rewrite done in 1.6?
[14:42:38] <rwaldron> a couple divs
[14:42:47] <rwaldron> sort of
[14:43:09] <rwaldron> you and snover agreed one day to remove all the nulling line
[14:43:20] <DaveMethvin> how much do we really leak there? The support stuff is only run once per page.
[14:43:25] <DaveMethvin> or does it accumulate over pages?
[14:43:28] <rwaldron> jaubourg just copied that precedent
[14:43:35] <rwaldron> well, its mostly in iframes apparently
[14:43:51] <rwaldron> where people are loading in content into an iframe
[14:43:58] <rwaldron> 1 page, 2, 3, 4, 5, etc
[14:44:01] <rwaldron> the leak grows
[14:44:03] <DaveMethvin> i had checked the ones i took out and didn't see any leaks, but not loading things into iframes lots of times
[14:44:07] <rwaldron> i repro'd the latest ticket
[14:44:09] <DaveMethvin> i didn't see any leaks after taking those out
[14:44:12] <rwaldron> and I can confirm it
[14:44:41] <DaveMethvin> so setting the local var to null fixes it?
[14:44:59] <rwaldron> I'm about to find out
[14:45:18] <rwaldron> i wanted to talk to you about it beore i invested _more_ time
[14:45:21] <rwaldron> one min
[14:45:37] <DaveMethvin> what's the test case look like?
[14:47:11] <rwaldron> not much
[14:47:18] <rwaldron> its an iframe that has 2 sources
[14:47:29] <rwaldron> all have minimal html
[14:47:31] <rwaldron> one sec
[14:47:52] <DaveMethvin> gotta run but i'll be back later
[14:47:56] <rwaldron> ok
[14:48:01] <rgbworld> Anyone interested in a quick $20 for some jqueryui datepicker assistance? or where might I look for assistance?
[14:48:14] <eddiemonge> #jquery
[14:48:15] <rwaldron> ajpiano ^^
[14:48:26] <ajpiano> you should look in #jquery
[14:48:31] <rwaldron> thanks bro
[14:48:34] <monokrome> or #jquery-ui
[14:48:54] <gnarf> i don't think we use #jquery-ui anymore
[14:49:02] <monokrome> Ah, okay.
[14:49:03] <ajpiano> correct
[14:49:20] <monokrome> Does anyone know how difficult it would be to modify jQuery to not pollute the global namespace?
[14:49:49] <monokrome> I've modified the Makefile to build another copy which outputs a require.js module, but I am wondering how hard it will be to get jQuery to actually act like one.
[14:50:00] <gnarf> monokrome: .noConflict()
[14:50:02] <gnarf> ?
[14:50:46] <eddiemonge> monokrome: yeah i think one variable isnt really polluting the global namespace.
[14:50:54] <monokrome> I was going to use noConflict, but I'm just wanting to make sure that jQuery doesn't pollute the global namespace anywhere else
[14:51:43] <monokrome> eddiemonge: I understand your argument, but I think that any variable that is not being used is pollution :)
[14:52:32] <rwaldron> monokrome so, where would you put it?
[14:52:53] <monokrome> rwaldron: Are you familiar with require.js?
[14:52:58] <rwaldron> yeah.
[14:53:11] <monokrome> Then I suppose that answers the question?
[14:53:24] <rwaldron> old news. search the tracker
[14:53:36] <monokrome> What's old news?
[14:53:50] <rwaldron> i believe asynch module support is will get voted in for 1.7
[14:53:55] <rwaldron> -is
[14:54:00] <monokrome> Okay?
[14:54:23] <monokrome> I've modified the makefile to do require.js as a secondary output file
[14:54:34] <monokrome> Is there already a patch for require.js that I should be using instead?
[14:57:01] <rwaldron> its still in pull request form
[14:57:20] <monokrome> That's fine with me. Whose repository is it?
[14:58:46] <rwaldron> let me google that for you?
[14:59:04] <rwaldron> -dev isnt a support channel
[14:59:13] <rwaldron> its specifically for development
[14:59:25] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/331
[14:59:30] <rwaldron> monokrome ^^^^^^^^^^
[15:00:06] <monokrome> Well, I wouldn't have written a requirejs module for jQuery if I hadn't searched for it initially :/
[15:01:55] <monokrome> That's an interesting way to have done it...
[15:01:55] <ajpiano> monokrome: you know that requirejs also has a build that does exactly what you need, right?
[15:02:05] <monokrome> It's not on their site any more
[15:02:29] <ajpiano> it's in the dev bundle, i belive, and also https://github.com/jrburke/require-jquery/blob/master/jquery-require-sample/webapp/scripts/require-jquery.js
[15:02:45] <ajpiano> i think it still adds jQuery to window though
[15:04:50] <monokrome> I didn't want to mess with the library itself, so I just defined an intro-require.js / outro-require.js and created a separate rule in Makefile for use as a require.js module. I think that seems better.
[15:05:06] <monokrome> Thanks, ajpiano. That might work :)
