[08:46:49] <gnarf> hey guys
[08:47:25] <gnarf> anyone got a chance to try and catch me up before the meeting? whats happened in the past 3 weeks or so :/
[08:49:24] <DaveMethvin> hey gnarf
[08:49:31] <DaveMethvin> well, let's see
[08:49:36] <DaveMethvin> we released 1.7.1
[08:49:41] <gnarf> 1.8 proposals?
[08:49:46] <gnarf> whats the status there
[08:49:46] <DaveMethvin> and we put out the blog post asking for 1.8 stuff
[08:49:58] <DaveMethvin> you should have gotten an email with the link to the spreadsheet
[08:50:02] <gnarf> whats the deadline / when do we think we are aiming to release 1.8?
[08:50:09] <gnarf> i believe i did - i remember seeing it
[08:50:11] <DaveMethvin> pretty open right now
[08:50:26] <DaveMethvin> i would think we need a 1.7.2 late in december maybe
[08:50:35] <gnarf> seems fair
[08:50:48] <DaveMethvin> but we also need to figure out any refactoring to reduce dependencies
[08:51:06] <DaveMethvin> and see how much progress we'll make on Closure compiler
[08:51:35] <DaveMethvin> so many ppl ask for "modular jQuery" but i don't see a lot of real opportunities there
[08:51:42] <rwaldron> gnarf "try and catch"
[08:51:44] <rwaldron> <3
[08:51:53] <DaveMethvin> if you look at mootools, once you select events almost everything is pulled in
[08:52:02] <gnarf> rwaldron: is that anything like "catch and release" ? :)
[08:52:04] <DaveMethvin> same for us
[08:52:26] <DaveMethvin> you could factor out effects and ajax that's about it
[08:52:31] <rwaldron> gnarf you said... "anyone got a chance to try and catch me up before the meeting?"
[08:52:37] <gnarf> ahh
[08:52:37] <rwaldron> like "try/catch"
[08:52:39] <gnarf> :)
[08:52:55] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i have a theory about all of this
[08:52:56] <DaveMethvin> we got it ... finally
[08:53:00] <gnarf> try { gnarf.update(); } catch ( e ) { facepalm(); }
[08:53:04] <rwaldron> of the millions of sites that are using jQuery
[08:53:30] <rwaldron> i think only 10 give a shit about modular jQuery or advanced mode compression
[08:53:40] <rwaldron> and those 10 just keep yapping
[08:54:10] <DaveMethvin> i have been looking inside a lot of apps lately that use jquery
[08:54:32] <DaveMethvin> it's pretty surprising how little they seem to care (or at least do) when it comes to size reduction
[08:54:38] <DaveMethvin> uncompressed scripts for example
[08:54:56] <rwaldron> I've delivered mobile apps to clients that use current jQuery, gzipped, with jQuery Mobile and they load fast and respond nicely
[08:55:06] <DaveMethvin> one big file?
[08:55:06] <rwaldron> these clients are happy with their products
[08:55:10] <rwaldron> no
[08:55:16] <DaveMethvin> oh like smaller chunks
[08:55:20] <rwaldron> jQuery is one file of its own
[08:55:29] <rwaldron> usually the google cdn
[08:55:33] <rwaldron> with a backup plan
[08:55:45] <rwaldron> then jQuery Mobile is another
[08:56:05] <rwaldron> then the app is a concatenated and compressed (min + gzip)
[08:56:13] <DaveMethvin> makes sense
[08:56:19] <rwaldron> by "app" i mean the "application javascript"
[08:56:33] <DaveMethvin> loading jQuery parts would seem like it would slow things down
[08:56:36] <DaveMethvin> more http requests
[08:56:39] <rwaldron> This is pretty common for our mobile apps
[08:56:52] <rwaldron> and I can honestly say, I don't feel like a modular jQuery is what I need
[08:57:03] <rwaldron> I would like better compression if anything
[08:57:25] <DaveMethvin> i would like to see the ability to have multiple files but compile them all with closure at once
[08:57:30] <DaveMethvin> to get the best compression
[08:57:42] <DaveMethvin> dunno how easy/possible that is atm
[08:57:58] <rwaldron> why closure?
[08:58:07] <rwaldron> we're developing a node based system called grunt
[08:58:10] <DaveMethvin> so it will rename "public" names
[08:58:15] <addyosmani> Somewhat on the fence. I agreed with @jaubourg's assertions that it might be tricky getting people to learn/adopt closure usage, even in the long term.
[08:58:18] <rwaldron> well, ben is and I'm "consulting"
[08:58:28] <DaveMethvin> so event.stopPropagation() gets renamed to a.x()
[08:58:34] <rwaldron> and it will build N scripts into one compressed file
[08:58:53] <miketaylr> i was on board until the "For instance, if you wanted say a webkit only jQuery"...
[08:59:03] <rwaldron> miketaylr that too
[08:59:16] <addyosmani> webkit only jQuery -> use that zepto crap.
[08:59:30] <rwaldron> an entire OTHER argument that I'm vehemently opposed to
[08:59:38] <rwaldron> addyosmani yah +9001
[08:59:47] <gnarf> afk a bit - brb for meeting
[08:59:56] <rwaldron> gnarf 1 min
[08:59:58] <DaveMethvin> miketaylr: supposedly closure could do a webkit-only jquery if we had a var for it, so someone building an app wrapped in phonegap could find that useful
[09:00:12] <DaveMethvin> but for web it would be a bad idea
[09:00:20] <DaveMethvin> ok meeting time
[09:00:48] <miketaylr> well, you have to define all the features with WEBKIT_ONLY and then !WEBKIT_ONLY
[09:00:55] <addyosmani> I remember reading someone mention an IE8+ optimized jQuery build or the likes with closure. Guess with markers it's effectively the same idea
[09:01:01] <miketaylr> dunno if that has to be in core, or in your app
[09:01:50] <miketaylr> but honestly, if you just want a phonegap app... why use jQuery?
[09:01:57] * miketaylr shrugs
[09:28:28] <DaveMethvin> first
[09:30:03] <gnarf> I've never really liked the resolveWith
[09:30:22] <gnarf> i always thought it would be better to set a context on the deferred somehow if you didn't want "this" to be the promise
[09:30:24] <rwaldron> So, i didnt mean to imply that it was useless and needed to go
[09:30:26] <gnarf> or whatever it is by default
[09:30:30] <rwaldron> i think that no one knows about it
[09:30:57] <DaveMethvin> there was a request to make our Deferred compliant with the Promises/A spec
[09:31:04] <DaveMethvin> which involves some breakage
[09:31:21] <gnarf> resolveWith( someElementAdded )
[09:31:31] <rwaldron> brb, I have to blow my nose
[09:31:39] <DaveMethvin> tmi!
[09:31:40] <rwaldron> which requires walking all the way to bocoup bathrooms
[09:31:50] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin :P
[09:32:12] <DaveMethvin> it would be nice to have fewer methods on the Deferred, it's a monster to document
[09:32:26] <DaveMethvin> most impls get by with .then( success, fail, progress )
[09:33:25] <DaveMethvin> and when we move to Promises/A compliance (if we do) the chained method meaning changes
[09:33:35] <DaveMethvin> which would be a good time to change it
[09:38:06] <rwaldron> holy crap
[09:38:17] <rwaldron> 82 items in the 1.8 doc
[09:38:22] <rwaldron> rm
[09:38:31] <rwaldron> "it stinks"
[09:38:48] <rwaldron> http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NDI2MzE3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjA4NjQyMQ@@._V1._SY317_.jpg
[09:38:55] <rwaldron> can we close stuff with this ^^
[09:40:12] <rwaldron> #11, recommend jQueryLint
[09:40:22] <ajpiano> oh man i am just looking at this for the first time
[09:40:39] <rwaldron> #12 seems interesting
[09:40:54] <rwaldron> well, the first part of it
[09:41:19] <rwaldron> #13 seems fun too
[09:41:56] <rwaldron> #14, use deferreds homie
[09:42:08] <ajpiano> who would have known that aliasing things for scope maintenance inside of a closure was the source of all code bloat
[09:43:22] <rwaldron> #18, umm... http://bugs.jquery.com
[09:43:58] <rwaldron> #19, submitted by someone who identifies themselves as "Phuc"
[09:44:07] <ajpiano> he could be philipino
[09:44:09] <ajpiano> filipino
[09:44:16] <ajpiano> 21 is insaneeee
[09:44:25] <rwaldron> yeah
[09:44:30] <rwaldron> i was just typing...
[09:44:36] <rwaldron> #21... yarite
[09:44:54] <rwaldron> #22, um... what? we do that.. dont we?
[09:46:11] <rwaldron> so, is it possible that #25 nd #28 are from the same person?
[09:46:53] <rwaldron> #31, good thinkin'
[09:47:07] <rwaldron> (I have a branch with jQuery.browser removed)
[09:47:21] <rwaldron> (I also have a repo with jQuery.browser as a plugin)
[09:49:53] <rwaldron> ahahah
[09:49:55] <rwaldron> #48
[09:51:55] <ajpiano> #41 is crazy
[09:52:48] <rwaldron> ahaha
[09:52:49] <rwaldron> totally
[09:53:10] <rwaldron> i got to the 4th "paragraph" and skipped to the next
[09:53:37] <rwaldron> #60 is not too shabby
[09:54:02] <jaubourg> too late for the meeting I gather? dang I hate how I cannot make it like all the time
[09:54:02] <bot-t> (142 hours ago) <miketaylr> tell jaubourg is http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/ still maintained?
[09:54:12] <miketaylr> heh
[09:54:13] <ajpiano> rwaldron: how could we possibly do that
[09:54:16] * miketaylr knows the answer
[09:54:20] <jaubourg> hey mike
[09:54:24] <miketaylr> hiya
[09:54:39] <jaubourg> didn't get time to look into this in the week-end :/
[09:54:43] <rwaldron> ajpiano not sure
[09:54:58] <rwaldron> it's not realistic is it?
[09:54:59] <mikesherov> I missed the meeting!
[09:55:11] <mikesherov> I had a minor fire to put out at work
[09:55:11] <ajpiano> i don't think so
[09:55:16] <rwaldron> ?slap mikesherov jaubourg
[09:55:17] * bot-t slaps mikesherov jaubourg around a bit with a large trout
[09:55:36] <mikesherov> And I had an agenda item!
[09:55:37] <jaubourg> now "mikesherov jaubourg" is a weird name
[09:55:44] <miketaylr> no rush jaubourg
[09:55:45] <rwaldron> ahahaha
[09:56:04] <mikesherov> Did we skip over discussing JSHint?
[09:56:36] <mikesherov> I was supposed to beat jaubourg into submission
[09:56:49] <rwaldron> mikesherov we discussed it
[09:56:56] <mikesherov> and.....
[09:56:58] <rwaldron> and at least DaveMethvin and I agreed with like it
[09:57:15] <mikesherov> did anyone disagree?
[09:57:25] <rwaldron> but then he mentioned that jaubourg wasnt a fan of onevar or something
[09:57:25] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg wasn't there, we had the ring all ready and boxing gloves
[09:57:26] <miketaylr> jaubourg: besides i still need to double check that fix, i'll ping you then
[09:57:52] <DaveMethvin> i don't particularly like onevar but the benefits won me over
[09:57:54] <mikesherov> no, jaubourg doesn't like having to define functions and vars before using them
[09:58:04] <rwaldron> at which point I joked that "jaubourg hates change"
[09:58:05] <mikesherov> I don't really even care about onevar
[09:58:18] <mikesherov> my PR brings us to undef:true, but no support for onevar yet
[09:58:38] <mikesherov> undef true is the big bug catching one
[09:58:46] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:58:46] <mikesherov> onevar is more of a style thing
[09:58:53] <rwaldron> mikesherov onevar has never had anything bad to say about you...
[09:59:06] <rwaldron> oh well in that case
[09:59:10] <rwaldron> neat
[09:59:12] <mikesherov> undef:true requires some minor moiving around of variables
[09:59:15] <rwaldron> undef true is good stuff
[09:59:19] <mikesherov> and that's what's in the PR
[09:59:23] <rwaldron>  nice
[09:59:39] <mikesherov> the big problem jaubourg had can be summarized as thus:
[09:59:40] <rwaldron> jaubourg any opinions there?
[10:00:16] <mikesherov> var a,b =function(){c = 'something';},c=b();
[10:00:28] <mikesherov> you see, in this case, you'd need to convert that to...
[10:00:43] <mikesherov> var a,c,b =function(){c = 'something';}; c=b();
[10:00:50] <mikesherov> that's the big deal
[10:01:04] <mikesherov> also, one other one:
[10:01:34] <mikesherov> var a = doSomething(); function doSomething(){ return 'value'}
[10:01:38] <mikesherov> needs to become:
[10:01:39] <rwaldron> ( #74 is a BLOCKER )
[10:01:42] <rwaldron> (hehehe)
[10:01:45] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: yeah i saw the changes in ajax and thought they were annoying but needed
[10:01:45] <rwaldron> ajpiano ^
[10:01:54] <mikesherov> function doSomething(){ return 'value'} var a = doSomething();
[10:01:57] <rwaldron> mikesherov that's dumb
[10:02:10] <DaveMethvin> IT'S ONLY A COMPUTER PEOPLE!
[10:02:10] <rwaldron> my biggest complaint about lint/hint
[10:02:20] <mikesherov> it's fine if it's dumb, but that's what JSHint requires
[10:02:23] <rwaldron> it's fucking CLUELESS about declaration hoisting
[10:02:36] <mikesherov> note that it caught 2 bugs in 1.7
[10:02:44] <mikesherov> yes, it's clueless about hoisting
[10:02:50] <mikesherov> and makes you do it yourself
[10:03:00] <rwaldron> the example you gave.. that happens implicitly
[10:03:04] <mikesherov> yes, it does
[10:03:08] <mikesherov> that's why it works :-)
[10:03:20] <rwaldron> it's silly that lint/hint ever complained about that
[10:03:20] <mikesherov> I know all about hoisting
[10:03:32] <rwaldron> i'm not saying that you don
[10:03:34] <rwaldron> don't
[10:03:36] <mikesherov> JSHint is moving to a new parser soon... and I suspect it'll give them the ability to figure out hoisting
[10:03:50] <rwaldron> yeah, anton was telling me about that at the last conf
[10:04:00] <DaveMethvin> i am very interested to see what the closure guys do to parse jquery
[10:04:03] <mikesherov> but until then, doesn't the benefit that it caught 2 bugs already outweigh the fact that it's not the brightest about hoisting?
[10:04:04] <rwaldron> we had a laugh about how shitty crockford's code is
[10:04:16] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: yeah that's what sold me
[10:04:21] <DaveMethvin> and one of the bugs was mine!
[10:04:26] <rwaldron> mikesherov i'm already sold
[10:04:36] <rwaldron> i use undef:true in all of my own projects
[10:04:54] <rwaldron> I've already firmly positioned myself in support of this change
[10:05:00] <mikesherov> and one was overriding window.body!
[10:05:16] <mikesherov> OK, so then what do I need to do to get you guys to merge the patch?
[10:05:27] <mikesherov> I suppose coming to the meeting would be a start :-P
[10:05:37] <DaveMethvin> i was just looking at the pull q now
[10:05:46] <mikesherov> I have 10 I think in there
[10:05:47] <mikesherov> LOL
[10:06:37] <mikesherov> oh, actually only 7, and one of them is sort of a dupe
[10:08:47] <rwaldron> ajpiano dude...
[10:08:51] <rwaldron> #80
[10:08:51] <ajpiano> let's just build a download buidler
[10:08:53] <rwaldron> gnarf ^
[10:08:59] <ajpiano> that always gives you the full jquery build
[10:09:04] <rwaldron> ajpiano +9001
[10:09:46] <ajpiano> this list is crazy, definitely a bit of culling to do
[10:09:59] <mikesherov> I put a lot of build realted stuff on the list
[10:10:04] <mikesherov> that I suppose doesn't belong there
[10:10:06] <ajpiano> 68 is pretty nuts too
[10:10:16] <mikesherov> I also put css3 support as a suggestion
[10:10:44] <gnarf> rwaldron: ?
[10:10:49] <gnarf> #80 what?
[10:11:00] <rwaldron> look at the 1.8 suggestion spreadsheet
[10:11:03] <gnarf> oh
[10:11:14] <gnarf> share the url so i dont have to search my inbox?
[10:11:31] <mikesherov> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj5JJFjq9rZDdDQxd2Q4NDdCTUNqREwwaGRPZEE1enc
[10:12:11] <mikesherov> SOME KIND OF ANIMATION INTERFACE
[10:12:17] <gnarf> heh
[10:12:27] <DaveMethvin> hey, that's some kind of animation interface you got there
[10:12:30] <gnarf> maybe we need to allow 1.8 suggestions for the dramatic readings
[10:12:33] <DaveMethvin> does all magic i hope
[10:13:41] <mikesherov> so, I repeat, what do I have to do to get JSHint PR integrated?
[10:13:42] <DaveMethvin> since the spreadsheet  has email addresses in it, I'm not sharing it beyond the team
[10:13:43] * gnarf gets scare of ajpiano's massive @
[10:14:15] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i will most likely go thru them and land a bunch tonight
[10:14:41] <mikesherov> so that's it? No one else to convince?
[10:15:08] <rwaldron> mikesherov simmer down broseph :P
[10:15:26] <mikesherov> I must improve the build process, it is my only mission
[10:15:38] <mikesherov> that and fix every bug ever in css
[10:15:50] <gnarf> mikesherov: i've got build issues with ant on ui
[10:15:59] <rwaldron> the issue: ant
[10:16:02] <gnarf> agreed
[10:16:02] <mikesherov> HAHA
[10:16:03] <rwaldron> bwahahahahah
[10:17:58] <mikesherov> OK, well, I just came here to hang my head in shame about missing the meeting.
[10:18:20] <mikesherov> other than that, I'll ask for comments on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/616 one last time
[10:18:21] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (5d, 17h ago): CSS fixes rollup: fixes #10796 and fixes #10639
[10:18:30] <mikesherov> gnarf: I'd love you to comment on it
[10:18:52] <gnarf> mikesherov: i'll add it to my growing list of things to look at when i get done with this shit at the "day job"
[10:19:01] <mikesherov> k, thanks
[10:19:15] <mikesherov> enjoy the day guys! later
[10:19:27] <ajpiano> gnarf: those routers aren't going to ... route themselves
[10:19:30] <ajpiano> GET TO WORK
[10:20:36] <gnarf> ajpiano: no shit
[11:10:34] <ajpiano> even if we do do modular jquery, we can't just go to tell with ourselves and put in all sorts of crazy features - the majority of people are still going to be using the one standard build always
[11:10:37] <ajpiano> true or false
[11:27:45] <gnarf> ajpiano: i vote true
[11:29:06] <danzik17> gnarf: but if its modular, then you could offer a standard package comprised of only the "standard components".  just playing devils advocate, i'm not too for going modular
[11:29:28] <gnarf> danzik17: don't we already do that? with plugins?
[11:29:39] <gnarf> like really - jquery-color is a good example
[11:29:48] <gnarf> not everyone needs it, and if you do, slap it on
[11:30:01] <gnarf> its just that our "core" is quite "large"
[11:30:12] <gnarf> like i'm writing this third party JS thing
[11:30:18] <gnarf> I'd love to be able to use .offset() from jQuery
[11:30:35] <gnarf> but its so damn tied into .css that i'm scared of trying to find a way to rip it out
[11:31:45] <danzik17> gnarf: i suppose... just wondering if making it modular would increase the code size for everyone else
[11:31:45] <davidmurdoch> Why is `typeof fn  === "function"` used in some places and `$.isFunction` in others? jQuery's gzipped size might benefit from normalizing this.
[11:33:22] <danzik17> that and i am against modularization because like you guys and a lot of others have pointed out, plugins have been depending on certain features for a while.  all of the sudden, they're going to either need to refactor or put out a list of jquery dependencies
[11:33:28] <gnarf> davidmurdoch: $.isFunction is a function? :)
[11:33:41] <danzik17> and probably if you use a single UI plugin, hell you may as well just use full jQuery since it'll probably depend on most of it
[11:33:41] <gnarf> davidmurdoch: typeof = function = better perf in tight loops
[11:33:50] <davidmurdoch> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isFunction/
[11:33:51] <gnarf> that would be my guess
[11:34:16] <gnarf> davidmurdoch: i meant because it is a function it inherently takes more time than the typeof check
[11:34:23] <gnarf> so in a perf scenario typeof might be better
[11:34:34] <davidmurdoch> So the only benefit to using isFunction in core is that it is shorter?
[11:35:09] * davidmurdoch searches jsperf
[11:35:35] <davidmurdoch> http://jsperf.com/isfunction-vs-typeof-function
[11:35:40] <gnarf> davidmurdoch: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isFunction/#comment-128339529
[11:38:01] <davidmurdoch> Booooo: "There was a problem loading Disqus." :-/ I can't see the comment

[11:41:05] <gnarf> stuff like that
[11:41:14] <gnarf> thats why $.isFunction exists :)
[11:51:00] <davidmurdoch> gnarf, thanks. I'll look into if there are any filesize/perf benefits of doing replacements for any typeof fn checks and submit a ticket + pull req if results look good.
[12:11:10] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin, rwaldron, mikesherov: the whole undef: true rule is broken in lint/hint
[12:12:59] <jaubourg> we should ask for jshint to integrate a true "non defined rule" rather than move around perfectly fine code because a rule a broken
[12:13:20] <jaubourg> "a broken" => "is broken"
[12:14:08] <jaubourg> I find the whole idea completely stupid: no bug has been found because of the broken behaviour, and a simple "undeclared in current scope rule" would have caught the bugs mikesherov refers to
[12:16:48] <jaubourg> what I really don't understand is that mike hinted at me it would be possible to make such a reduced rule... but it seems now that he prefers to impact a lot of code for nothing
[12:17:57] <jaubourg> ... but apprently, I don't make much sense?
[12:18:44] <timmywil> I don't think it would be trivial to implement an option for truly undefined.
[12:19:20] <timmywil> given the current structure of lint/hint
[12:19:28] <jaubourg> no second pass system?
[12:20:16] <jaubourg> I find it simply amazingly dumb to re-arrange fine code because having the correct rule coded in an help tool is inconvenient
[12:20:38] <jaubourg> but I'm always the one complaining, aren't I?
[12:20:49] <timmywil> isn't it easier to read to define vars before you use them?
[12:21:31] <timmywil> in dave's rewrite of event, he seemed to do that naturally
[12:22:11] <jaubourg> timmy: look at the code in $.Deferred, especially how the defer and promise variables are initialized... promise uses defer in some methods, yet defer is created using promise.promise... jshin is unable to understand that defer will not be used before it's initialized, which is completely stupid
[12:22:56] <jaubourg> no hoisting, so you end up with cumbersome, declare here, initialize later, just because jshint cannot hoist
[12:23:07] <jaubourg> I dunno, I reallt hate this limitation
[12:23:08] <timmywil> yea, that's a good point
[12:23:53] <jaubourg> I'd honestly be very saddened if we had that change in... yet I understand the need to track undefined vars
[12:24:03] <jaubourg> I simply don't think the need outweights the cost here
[12:24:13] <timmywil> well, I can track them locally in sublime :)
[12:25:16] <jaubourg> timmywil: so, are you implying that jshint only works on a syntactic level: there is no possibility to make a "semantics" second pass?
[12:25:43] <jaubourg> like on the resulting tree after having extracting specific info (here hoisting)
[12:26:35] <timmywil> well, it's a possibility. maybe I'm assuming too much
[12:27:48] <jaubourg> I dunno, I never looked into it
[12:33:23] <gnarf> jaubourg: i actually think there was an undef caught from undef:true
[12:34:00] <gnarf> not sure tho
[12:47:04] <timmywil> jaubourg: looks like it does not do a second pass
[12:47:16] <timmywil> i don't know how hard it would be to implement
[12:51:19] <jaubourg> :|
[12:51:25] <jaubourg> god I hate this kind of situation
[12:51:52] <jaubourg> gnarf: there were two, but not because of the broken part of the rule
[12:52:31] <jaubourg> we have lotsa re-ordering in the code that ammount to no bug fixed
[12:53:33] <jaubourg> I mean, isn't the whole point of jshint vs jslint to avoid this kind of situation?
[13:00:17] <timmywil> we should ask anton why he's avoided a hoisting option
[13:01:17] <timmywil> he's closed several issues regarding it wontfix
[13:05:08] <jaubourg> probably because it's a nightmare
[13:07:21] <timmywil> i'd imagine
[13:11:38] <rwaldron> who is "sindresorhus"
[13:11:45] <rwaldron> timmywil jaubourg ^^?
[13:11:59] <rwaldron> oh, there is someone named such in here now
[13:12:04] <rwaldron> sindresorhus, hi!
[13:12:11] <sindresorhus> Hi!
[13:12:46] <rwaldron> thanks for the triage
[13:12:51] <timmywil> obviously, his name is sind resorhus
[13:13:19] <timmywil> jk
[13:13:31] <sindresorhus> Sure, been wanting to contribute to jQuery for a while, but haven't had the time, until now.
[13:13:37] <sindresorhus> or Sindre Sorhus
[13:13:37] <rwaldron> neat
[13:13:41] <rwaldron> ahaha
[13:13:44] <rwaldron> take that timmywil!
[13:13:50] <sindresorhus> I'm from Norway
[13:13:55] <rwaldron> Cool
[13:13:59] <rwaldron> I'm Rick Waldron
[13:14:07] <rwaldron> (while we're introducing)
[13:14:20] <rwaldron> triaging is suppper helpful
[13:14:23] <sindresorhus> Yeah, I know. I've been lurking here for a while.
[13:14:26] <sindresorhus> ;)
[13:14:34] <timmywil> ew, stalker
[13:14:54] <rwaldron> i feel so... violated.
[13:15:00] <rwaldron> just kidding!
[13:15:04] <timmywil> you always feel like that
[13:15:11] <sindresorhus> Haha, it's your fault you're so active on GitHub.
[13:15:28] <sindresorhus> You're filling up my newsfeed
[13:15:49] <rwaldron> sorry
[13:16:02] <rwaldron> i have a habit of forking stuff
[13:16:06] <sindresorhus> Not a bad thing
[13:16:08] <rwaldron> instead of just hitting "watch"
[13:16:14] <rwaldron> because i actually wanna do stuff
[13:16:23] <sindresorhus> I've discovered some great project that way
[13:16:31] <rwaldron> and also because I almost never look at my activity feed
[13:17:16] <rwaldron> sindresorhus, when you look at tickets...
[13:17:48] <rwaldron> do you see: http://gyazo.com/638603c19cd2c84f8ffb5061835b4dd1.png
[13:17:51] <rwaldron> those tools?
[13:18:27] <sindresorhus> rwaldron: No...
[13:18:31] <rwaldron> hm
[13:18:32] <rwaldron> ok
[13:18:37] <rwaldron> i didnt think so
[13:19:28] <rwaldron> so, when we post back that "thanks for filing a bug, now give us a damn jsfiddle" message, you'll need to also check the box "return to reporter for more information"
[13:19:38] <rwaldron> which doesnt actually show on that box, because i already did that
[13:19:41] * rwaldron sighs
[13:19:42] <rwaldron> soooo
[13:19:49] <rwaldron> let me see if i can switch that on for you
[13:21:26] <rwaldron> sindresorhus yt?
[13:21:30] <rwaldron> go back to this ticket: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10908
[13:21:39] <sindresorhus> rwaldron: Yes, thanks ;)
[13:21:41] <rwaldron> tell me if you see the tools at the bottom
[13:22:23] <sindresorhus> rwaldron: I do
[13:22:27] <rwaldron> sweet
[13:22:46] <rwaldron> it appears that you believe this to be invalid?
[13:22:48] <rwaldron> i agree
[13:23:06] <rwaldron> Set the "Priority" to "Low"
[13:23:22] <rwaldron> Set the "Component" to "Core"
[13:23:37] <rwaldron> Click the radio next to "Resolve"
[13:23:43] <rwaldron> and select "Invalid"
[13:23:50] <rwaldron> dunzo
[13:23:58] <rwaldron> you'll basically do alot of that
[13:24:20] <sindresorhus> rwaldron: Will do
[13:24:21] <rwaldron> the first two are important for "book keeping"
[13:24:31] <rwaldron> so we can see what is closed for what part of the lib
[13:25:45] <rwaldron> dont worry if your not sure what stuff to pick from all the options
[13:25:59] <rwaldron> if you make a mistake, someone will likely double back for you
[13:26:02] <rwaldron> we do that
[13:26:12] <rwaldron> eventually it will all catch on
[13:26:21] <rwaldron> so, welcome to bugsville.
[13:26:23] <rwaldron> :D
[13:26:43] <sindresorhus> rwaldron: Thanks, will do my best.
[13:26:47] <rwaldron> awesome
[13:27:35] <sindresorhus> I've also noticed a lot of people don't read the big red box. Are people blind?
[13:34:26] <gnarf> sindresorhus: yes
[13:34:54] <gnarf> sindresorhus: probably not the ones that are filing the bugs - they need a better excuse
[13:35:53] <miketaylr> sindresorhus: what part of norway are you in?
[13:36:15] <sindresorhus> miketaylr: I live in Lillehammer, a couple of hours north of Oslo.
[13:36:20] <miketaylr> sweet
[13:36:29] <miketaylr> i'm in oslo a couple of times a year
[13:37:01] <sindresorhus> miketaylr: What brings you to far north?
[13:37:10] <miketaylr> sindresorhus: work (at opera)
[13:37:28] <miketaylr> i might be there in feb... or april for a team meeting
[13:37:35] <sindresorhus> miketaylr: Ah, right.
[13:41:35] <sindresorhus> For those who are interested. I'm 22 years old. I work as a programmer/photographer in the Norwegian Armed Forces. In my free time I hack around with my own pet projects, mostly in JS/Python. I've used jQuery since 1.2 or something. I'm planning to contribute on a regular basis to the jQuery project as much as I can. Looking forward getting to know you guys!
[13:44:12] <miketaylr> that's awesome
[15:08:18] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: OK, I'm about to close a ticket as invalid because it only shows up when you use it wrong
[15:08:41] <mikesherov> just want to make sure one time that I got it right: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10582
[15:09:14] <mikesherov> IE<9 throws an error on this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ucmGV/7/
[15:09:31] <mikesherov> trying to use: <input type="button" value="(wrong) Move the red square" onclick="jQuery('#square').animate({marginLeft: '=0'}, 500);" />
[15:09:39] <mikesherov> notice the '=0'
[15:21:05] <mikesherov> Just closed my first ticket as wontfix: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10582 I'd love for someone to let me know if I did the right thing.
[18:45:19] <bribroder> hey guys, quick one. can you explain the syntax used in the #1 answer?
[18:45:25] <bribroder> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3471973/jquery-text-change-on-toggle
[18:47:50] <gnarf> bribroder: support in #jquery
