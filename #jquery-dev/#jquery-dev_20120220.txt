[08:29:32] <jzaefferer> hey ben_alman, grunt is lacking an actual Getting Started - I installed it, but can't figure out how to use `grunt ini`
[08:29:53] <jzaefferer> getting errors messages about specifying what template to use, but `grund init jquery` doesn't work
[08:30:08] <jzaefferer> that just causes it to complain about a missing grunt.js file again
[08:30:36] <jzaefferer> *`grunt init` FFS
[08:50:23] <rwaldron> jzaefferer
[08:50:27] <rwaldron> grunt init:jquery
[08:50:35] <rwaldron> grunt init:commonjs
[08:50:38] <rwaldron> grunt init:node
[08:50:41] <rwaldron> needs a colon
[08:50:42] <rwaldron> :)
[08:51:14] <rwaldron> but you're right... I saw the progress first hand and still felt like I needed "Getting Started..."
[08:52:13] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: thanks, that works, if that is all that's needed - that should be right in the Installing section
[09:34:39] <rwaldron> Sorry was on the same call as ajpiano
[09:34:50] <rwaldron> i was actually talking to ajpiano

[20:42:06] <aviraldg> Hi. I just got my hands on jQuery from git and it seems like it's failing almost all tests, despite the fact that:
[20:42:08] <aviraldg> 1. The build process completes without any problems.
[20:42:10] <aviraldg> 2. I have a proper testing environment set up (with PHP)
[20:42:12] <aviraldg> 3. I've tried `make; make clean`, but to no avail.
[20:42:16] <aviraldg> Any idea about what might be causing this?
