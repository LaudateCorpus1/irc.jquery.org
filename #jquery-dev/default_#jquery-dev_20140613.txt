[07:05:23] <scott_gonzalez> Can I get someone to review https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/270 ?
[07:11:51] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 or timmywil, can you take a look at the PR from scott_gonzalez ? ^^
[07:14:22] <scott_gonzalez> I could also use a review of https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1593
[07:14:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to have a release of Sizzle after ther Sizzle PR lands.
[07:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> Then I can pull that into the jQuery PR and add the license file.
[07:17:05] <DaveMethvin> sorry, rebooted

[07:45:42] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle|detached: Can you check https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/pull/301 when you get a chance?
[08:55:21] <DaveMethvin> Ok, so OpenTable buys QuickCue and now Priceline buys OpenTable. Is timmywil rich yet?
[08:57:32] <frankenstein> Is it possible to submit an item for review to appear in this list? http://jquerymobile.com/resources/#Apps
[09:43:26] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: inorite?
[09:43:42] <timmywil> WHY DO PEOPLE KEEP BUYING ME
[09:44:25] <DaveMethvin> headline: "Priceline buys timmywil to bolster DOM selection skills"
[09:45:37] <timmywil> I think you mean DOM caressing skillz
[09:45:57] <timmywil> I please the DOM
[09:46:40] <DaveMethvin> "Waitaminit, you said this timmywil guy was good at selecting tables! I meant restaurant tables!"
[10:02:06] <scott_gonzalez> frankenstein: Send a PR for https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com
[10:05:46] <frankenstein> scott_gonzalez, thank you.
[10:06:37] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Any idea what this is about? https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery/builds/27251518
[10:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> This is the only thing I changed related to JSCS: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1593/files#diff-0
[10:08:12] <DaveMethvin> no idea ... did jscs get updated via some sloppy dependency? 
[10:08:53] <DaveMethvin> nope
[10:11:29] <DaveMethvin> the grunt-jscs-checker there is a specific version, and the jscs it pulls in is ~1.3.0 which has no patch upgrade tho there's a 1.4.x
[10:11:48] <DaveMethvin> wait, is that a jscs error message, or a grunt one?
[10:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> I can't tell.
[10:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's extremely vague.
[10:14:15] <DaveMethvin> the "use --force" sounds like grunt but i'm not sure
[10:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that is from Grunt, but the error message could be from JSCS, right?
[10:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> The "Unexpected token s" part.
[10:15:47] <DaveMethvin> i guess? that's what has me confused
[10:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> I found it.
[10:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> Missing quote in .jscsrc
[10:17:03] <DaveMethvin> well YEAH now that you point it out its obvous! :) 
[10:17:04] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1593/files#diff-e5b8cacefa8c329daed4f4b628f72e61R4
[10:17:31] <DaveMethvin> boy that's a tough error, thank goodness for diffs
[10:18:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'd be useful if it at least mentioned which file the unexpected token was in.
[10:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I pushed a fix, so we'll see if it passes now.
[10:18:33] <DaveMethvin> that's probably a good issue for jscs, it could at least give the file name
[10:18:45] <DaveMethvin> or the module/app giving the message
[10:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> Well, looks like JSCS gives good output in the CLI version: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/30c0841c49545d16657a
[10:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try with the node API.
[10:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> See if that same level of detail is provided.
[10:23:17] <DaveMethvin> it must be catching the error and printing it out, then exiting 
[10:23:28] <DaveMethvin> the dump would be better
[10:23:35] <DaveMethvin> let me look at the jscs code
[10:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> I actually can't find docs about how to use this in node.
[10:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this is much more complex than I expected: https://github.com/gustavohenke/grunt-jscs-checker/blob/master/tasks/lib/jscs.js
[10:27:04] <scott_gonzalez> That's the wrapper around JSCS for the Grunt plugin.
[10:27:38] <DaveMethvin> damn thatsa lotta code for a wrapper
[10:29:15] <DaveMethvin> ah markelog is ahead of us, this got fixed in 0.4
[10:29:16] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs/commit/2d91fe31fda50b6be35b8d1d117b15a9772c7102
[10:31:10] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:32:19] <DaveMethvin> the issue's error looks just like ours: https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs/issues/409 :)
[10:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, build passed. Can you review https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1593?
[10:35:56] <DaveMethvin> looking now
[10:44:07] <DaveMethvin> lgtm scott_gonzalez, i like having the /external layout
[10:44:26] <DaveMethvin> is qunit going to change their license from MIT-LICENSE.txt to LICENSE.txt?
[10:45:03] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yeah, everything will change to LICENSE.txt once all of these updates are done.
[10:45:09] <DaveMethvin> ok
[10:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> I made sure to update all the projects to use bowercopy 1.0.0 since that will notify us if a file is renamed and we don't udpate our config.
[10:46:10] <DaveMethvin> much nicer than silent failure, i agree
