[03:24:41] <Krinkle> Hm,.. why is it that most of the time git hashes aren't linkified in trac?
[03:24:45] <Krinkle> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13997
[03:25:08] <Krinkle> Seems like trivial thing to parse out 7+ length hex sequences between word boundaries into a github url.
[03:25:24] <Krinkle> I suspect it's probably doing something more complex and as such failing.
[04:20:54] <m_gol> `tell DaveMethvin yeah, I was thinking the same that bower is for client-side, npm for node... the thing is, npm does a lot of things making scripting in node easier by supplying require, resolving paths etc. but bower only downloads files and that's it. We need to copy those files later anyway. npm is good for just downloading files as well and in fact it's way better since it has publishing and we never have to worry about pas
[04:21:39] <m_gol> DaveMethvin|away ^^^ (did the `tell bot get broken?)
[04:22:50] <m_gol> DaveMethvin DaveMethvin|away: also, the prepublish hook which would make all of these detached tags unnecessary & would decrease repo size. The AnguarJS team is going to use npm for distrubuting Angular 2.0 packages but they won't use require but regular ES6 modules so this is happening
[04:29:00] <m_gol> DaveMethvin DaveMethvin|away: in fact, bower is reinventing a part of npm functionality and doing it quite poorly. It seems standardizing on npm packages with the browser keyword would be safer; we just need to remember that publishing on npm !== you have to use require

[04:33:51] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I'm not sure what to do with changes like https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1570... It's not adding a lot of value but the OP is right; should I ask to sign the CLA & merge it or just commit with thanks? With api sites I wouldn't have doubts but I'm not sure if we should treat core commits in the same way
[04:40:31] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: i would just go ahead with the full CLA, if their name is on the commit we need that. If they don't want to sign then one of us can just do a commit with the deletion
[04:40:40] <m_gol> k
[04:53:08] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I'll ask Igor Minar from the Angular team about exact reasons for this moving-data between elements, maybe it could be done more elegantly

[05:52:33] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: it's not '//#sourceMap', it's '//# sourceMappingURL='
[05:52:49] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah ... i'll fix that
[05:53:03] <m_gol> a name and a space after #
[05:55:27] <DaveMethvin> Fixed, thanks! I think from now on I'll just point people to the jquery.com/download page ... although that page isn't updating for some reason
[05:57:01] <m_gol> weird...
[05:57:08] <m_gol> tagging should do a publish automatically
[05:57:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah i tagged it and pushed with tags
[05:57:22] <m_gol> who can check it? gnarf?
[05:57:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah i already pinged them in -infrastructure
[05:57:57] <m_gol> k
[05:58:57] <m_gol> just redirecting to /download will make it harder to download older versions from old blog posts
[05:59:06] <m_gol> unless that's what you want to achieve :P
[05:59:10] <DaveMethvin> :)
[06:00:50] <DaveMethvin> I'm mainly trying to avoid having information in about 5 different places that needs to be updated on each release, and in ways that make it hard or dangerous to have the release script try to do it automagically
[06:03:09] <m_gol> well, blog posts aren't updated so that shouldn't be much of an issue
[06:04:01] <DaveMethvin> Mainly I have to say a lot of the same stuff each time like 1.x vs 2.x, sourcemaps, etc.

[06:05:42] <m_gol> hmm, right
[06:05:54] <m_gol> we could have general comments about that on the download page
[06:05:56] <m_gol> and link to them
[06:06:11] <m_gol> but since links to versions change, perhaps they should stay in blog posts

[07:05:27] <DaveMethvin> haha
[07:08:07] <m_gol> 1-line changes are the most difficult :P
[07:08:18] <DaveMethvin> you said it!
[07:08:31] <DaveMethvin> i can manage to screw up more 1-line commits
[07:08:37] <m_gol> :)
[07:08:46] <m_gol> if only we had PRs tested on Travis...
[07:08:47] <m_gol> ;)
[07:08:56] <DaveMethvin> dreamer
[07:09:38] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: m_gol: what stops you guys from testing pr's on travis?
[07:09:42] <m_gol> we'd need https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/1946 to be resolved...
[07:09:51] <m_gol> or just expose our private keys, yeah
[07:09:56] <m_gol> many projects do that btw
[07:10:04] <m_gol> and apparently it's not exploited
[07:10:13] <m_gol> and you can always reset the key if this happens
[07:10:25] <m_gol> but it still seems not the right thing to do...
[07:10:30] <DaveMethvin> i suspect that it's exploited but not detected
[07:10:34] <m_gol> haha
[07:10:43] <m_gol> in Angular they reverse the key in settings :P
[07:10:44] <arschmitz> couldnt you just only do phantom tests on travis for now
[07:10:52] <arschmitz> and add browserstack once its resolved?
[07:10:53] <m_gol> I wonder how many people does that stop :P
[07:10:56] <DaveMethvin> man those Angular guys are hackerz
[07:11:14] <m_gol> they know it's crap but maybe it does stop some people
[07:11:15] <DaveMethvin> phantom is pretty useless for us
[07:11:18] <m_gol> yeah
[07:11:23] <m_gol> it's like Safari 5.0
[07:11:40] <m_gol> and we're dropping 5.1 in a few months or so
[07:11:41] <DaveMethvin> it only catches really obvious things like number of expected tests :P
[07:11:45] <m_gol> :P
[07:11:49] <m_gol> touche :P
[07:12:05] <m_gol> but Travis does have some non-too-obsolete Fx
[07:12:14] <m_gol> that's what markelog put in Sizzle config
[07:12:21] <m_gol> so we'd at least catch those bastards
[07:13:13] <arschmitz> so does that mean that every one that uses phantom to unit test and uses jquery will break ha ha ?

[07:13:36] <doesallmagic2> m.goleb: Core: Remove repeated test
[07:13:38] <DaveMethvin> well technically phantomjs isn't a supported browser :)
[07:13:47] <arschmitz> right 
[07:14:01] <DaveMethvin> but we keep it limping along even though it's the oldest webkit on the face of the planet
[07:14:08] <DaveMethvin> well except for android 2.x
[07:14:18] <arschmitz> ha
[07:14:45] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: hey touchmove still works in 2.3 lol
[07:15:01] <arschmitz> nothing else does but hey
[07:15:20] <arschmitz> they didn't retroactively break that one
[07:16:00] <m_gol> I really dislike the ancientness of PhantomJS engine
[07:16:03] <DaveMethvin> that't the thing about hopelessly obsolete browsers, at least they don't change their bugs
[07:16:10] <m_gol> we keep it mostly so that other projects can test on Phantom
[07:16:12] <m_gol> like Mobile ;)
[07:16:31] <m_gol> but when the day comes that we drop Android 2.3 I wouldn't still want to support it ;)
[07:16:33] <DaveMethvin> i wish we could talk the blink team into doing a headless one
[07:16:49] <arschmitz> yeah its a pain someone needs to make something better
[07:17:17] <m_gol> from what I've heard, PhantomJS 2 is supposed to be based on QtWebKit and only v3 on Chromium
[07:17:20] <m_gol> or sth like that
[07:17:59] <DaveMethvin> oh while i'm wishing, i wish Apple would let people install real browsers
[07:18:11] <arschmitz> ha
[07:18:39] <arschmitz> i was actually doing some tests just the other day on if they had removed the restriction on js execution in apps yet
[07:18:42] <arschmitz> nope!
[07:19:08] <arschmitz> iphone5s and ios7 js in a webview is 3X slower still
[07:19:43] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: other browser engines? if they've just allowed to use JIT in other browsers I'd be happy...
