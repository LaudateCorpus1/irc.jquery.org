[13:12:24] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you just made my week dude...
[13:12:53] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: heh - saw your dubba johnny listens and decided to forward that playlist to you ;)
[13:13:06] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: your instinct was good
[13:13:37] <ryanneufeld> This is exactly what I've needed all week. I shared it with another dub-head here in the office
[13:13:55] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: its collaborative, feel free to add suggestions ;)
[13:14:00] <ryanneufeld> Ill do
[13:14:04] <ryanneufeld> *will do
[13:14:13] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: I've just been doing "start playlist radio" on it and adding songs that i like that come up
[13:14:29] <ryanneufeld> not a bad idea
