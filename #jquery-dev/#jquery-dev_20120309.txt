[08:14:00] <DaveMethvin> ok, looks like the decks are clear for 1.7.2rc1, i expect to have it out this afternoon!
[08:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: It's about time we land on a .2 release. You screwed up the whole Internet leaving jQuery on an odd number!
[08:22:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah and everyone knows the .2s are the BEST scott_gonzalez!
[08:22:27] <DaveMethvin> that's why i've been waiting to clean everything up
[08:22:34] <DaveMethvin> i don't want a .3
[08:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> Good thinking :-)
[08:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> Of couse UI is on .18 already...
[08:23:30] <DaveMethvin> no comment. :P
[08:54:34] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I must have been under a rock, gratz regarding your position at the foundation
[08:55:08] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[09:05:06] <jaubourg> shouldn't you rename DaveResig or something?

[11:10:43] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[11:10:44] <bot-t> (41 hours 2 mins ago) <DaveMethvin> tell mikesherov Does http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11390 seem familiar?
[11:11:18] <mikesherov> yes, thanks bot-t. That's what I was trying to get more info about
[11:11:31] <DaveMethvin> lol ... in a meeting atm
[11:12:24] <mikesherov> OK, when you get a chance. I'm just a bit hazy on what the expected vs. actual is on that bug report.
[11:20:13] <David_Souther> smart IRC bots are smart. Yay bot-t
[11:21:35] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: looks like https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/a52391aa1dcf3f28306e274e1b2d7f0affc4e725 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/935df49d77c9719b12e28b07e1c26bcf8a5ab6a7 fixed the issue
[11:21:37] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by dmethvin (2w, 14h ago): Fix #7986. $.support.boxModel shan't be fooled by page-level CSS.
[11:22:37] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: as of 13 days ago, #7986 wasn't properly merged. Then I did the fix, and it's been fixed since then.
[11:22:51] <mikesherov> that's why I couldn't repro!
[11:22:57] <DaveMethvin> ah ok, thanks for looking at it
[11:23:29] <mikesherov> I'm closing the ticket now
[11:36:14] <matjas> http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size 1.7.2rc1 added
[11:38:03] <mikesherov> matjas: NOOOOO
[11:38:23] <matjas> Δ +199 bytes FFFFFFUUUUUU
[11:41:07] <DaveMethvin> well, if people would stop reporting bugs we could stop adding fixes
[11:41:32] <DaveMethvin> we can't lose significant bytes without removing stuff, and that takes longer notice
[11:41:49] <mikesherov> yeah, I swear, I have at least 400+ bytes coming out in 1.8
[11:41:57] <mikesherov> give me another chance PLZ!
[11:42:13] <DaveMethvin> and 1.9 will let us pull a lot of junk out
[11:42:21] <matjas> man who cares about bytes
[11:42:38] <DaveMethvin> well YOU must :)
[11:42:40] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquery: jQuery 1.7.2 Release Candidate 1 is now available! Happy testing! http://t.co/ZrtKMbhK ★ http://bit.ly/xWeN30
[11:43:11] <matjas> from now on jQuery’s going on a diet
[11:43:41] <matjas> 1.8 will be 1.7’s anorectic sibling
[11:44:22] <DaveMethvin> 1.8 WILL be smaller than 1.7 (he says) but we can't remove a lot of junk until 1.9
[11:44:36] <DaveMethvin> we need to give people time to change their code before we break it
[11:44:50] <DaveMethvin> that's what the deprecation process is about
[11:45:36] <matjas> i really wonder how much of an issue this all is, given that people deploy their site with a certain jquery version, and never update it *unless* something breaks
[11:45:53] <matjas> but this has been discussed on the mailing list before
[11:46:01] <DaveMethvin> it's not that simple ... people use plugins, and those plugins aren't updated every month
[11:46:28] <DaveMethvin> so someone tries to update jQuery to get some great new feature, but maybe some of their plugins break
[11:46:36] <DaveMethvin> or their own code does because of attr/prop etc
[11:47:16] <DaveMethvin> it would be easier if there were no third-party plugins, but then of course jQuery wouldn't be as useful
[11:48:12] * matjas shakes fist at third-party plugins
[11:48:30] <DaveMethvin> i do want to point out that even if we put it on a MEGA diet, we are only cutting  maybe 10k min/gz out of the file
[11:48:42] <matjas> but still… if it’s just for some rad new feature… if upgrading jquery breaks it, either fix your code, or just don’t upgrade
[11:48:58] <DaveMethvin> that won't make much of a dent  in the overall throw weight of most pages
[11:49:06] <DaveMethvin> js+css+html+images
[11:49:53] <DaveMethvin> i think what we're doing is important but it's not going to solve the problem that most sites have, which is that THEIR OWN code is bloated or they don't follow simple practices like combining/compressing scripts and CSS
[11:50:08] <danzik171> you really think you can but 1/3 of the current size of jQuery out?
[11:50:11] <danzik171> cut*
[11:51:35] <DaveMethvin> danzik171: it's more for our own sanity than for "load time" of the average jquery site
[11:52:14] <DaveMethvin> http://apple.com  serves out an uncompressed and uncombined copy of prototype.js and scriptaculous FFS
[11:52:28] <DaveMethvin> you'd think bandwidth was important to them
[11:53:15] <danzik171> and as you noted the other day, amazon is on 1.2.6 or something like that.   i just mean - what do you even cut out to save 10k min/gz?
[11:53:45] <mikesherov> MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
[11:53:59] <DaveMethvin> i don't think the "off the rack" jquery served off code.jquery.com or the other CDNs will get that small
[11:54:23] <DaveMethvin> it's more that, for example, you might be able to build a custom jquery for your project that didn't have $.ajax if all you needed was JSONP requests
[11:54:32] <mikesherov> Look, at the end of the day, we keep coming back to CCAO or modularization
[11:54:39] <DaveMethvin> yep
[11:54:41] <mikesherov> that's what's gonna matter
[11:55:11] <mikesherov> if you REALLY care about jQuery filesize, and you've done every other optimization you can, then you'll be willing to run it through CCAO
[11:55:36] <mikesherov> we need to make jQuery CCAO friendly without effecting the default filesize that much
[11:55:57] <mikesherov> then we can tell people that if they want, they can serve it themselves, or build a modular version, or whatever
[11:56:02] <DaveMethvin> but, as sites like Apple.com show, the majority of people are not at all serious about load performance
[11:56:08] <mikesherov> Right
[11:56:16] <DaveMethvin> they are simply looking at one number, the size of jquery, and bitching about it
[11:56:20] <mikesherov> the new iPad page is like 9.5MB!
[11:56:30] <DaveMethvin> at the same time they load a dozen style sheets and 15 scripts
[11:56:34] <mikesherov> right
[11:56:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah that iPad page image is beeeeyutiful
[11:56:53] <mikesherov> anyway, the modularization / CCAO path lets us ignore these people
[11:57:11] <DaveMethvin> but god forbid they add jQuery to it, then it would REALLY be bloated :)
[11:57:21] <mikesherov> if you want smaller jquery, and you've done other things, build your own, but sorry if your plugins don't work!
[11:57:49] <danzik171> that's actually what i did for an internal mobile site, and i STILL didn't save all that much =P
[11:58:07] <DaveMethvin> i can definitely see someone using jQuery minus ajax and effects, with only basic JSONP support and CSS transitions for animations
[11:58:19] <mikesherov> right
[11:58:21] <mikesherov> sure
[11:58:39] <mikesherov> but the point is, build your own and face the consequences, or eat the 30K
[11:58:43] <mikesherov> they'll have the choice
[11:58:51] <mikesherov> and we can put on sunglasses and walk away
[11:59:01] <ajpiano> the notion that this is like magically gonna fix the internet is really absurd though
[11:59:08] <mikesherov> ABSURD
[11:59:11] <mikesherov> completely absurd
[11:59:14] <ajpiano> i don't understand that whole kerfluffle the other day with all the sites load times
[11:59:17] <mikesherov> it's the vocal minority
[11:59:27] <DaveMethvin> a lot of it is simply misinformed
[11:59:30] <ajpiano> like, OMG THESE GUYS ARE LOADING A MEG OF JS... they really need to stop paying the jquery tax
[11:59:32] <mikesherov> echo chamber
[11:59:55] <mikesherov> it's like the whole kerfuffle over localStorage
[12:00:01] <mikesherov> it has uses
[12:00:04] <DaveMethvin> absolutely
[12:00:06] <mikesherov> it's not fucking harmful
[12:00:26] <mikesherov> just understand WTH you're doing before you do it
[12:00:57] <mikesherov> I save tons of "is it still cached" network load by storing JS templates in localStorage
[12:01:06] <mikesherov> but anyway...
[12:01:34] <DaveMethvin> well when 1.8 comes out the laundry bills are gonna be high, because everyone is gonna pee their pants it's soo good
[12:01:51] <DaveMethvin> especially when we remove IE 6/7/8 support
[12:01:53] * DaveMethvin runs away
[12:04:08] <mikesherov> NICE
[12:04:20] <mikesherov> I think we should remove all support except webkit
[12:04:23] <mikesherov> :-P
[13:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Does the learn site use nested categories?
[13:48:56] <ajpiano> as of right now there is only one level deep
[13:49:12] <scott_gonzalez> ok
