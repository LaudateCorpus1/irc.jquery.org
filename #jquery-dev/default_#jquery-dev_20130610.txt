[14:57:13] <Danwe_WMDE> is it valid to overwrite some jQuery object collection value by its index? E.g. var foos = $( '.foo' ); foos[0] = $( '<span>' ). I don't suppose it is (e.g. foos.length will not work). So is this documented somewhere, didn't really find anything.
[15:00:38] <m_gol> Danwe_WMDE: you should never do such things
[15:01:56] <Danwe_WMDE> m_gol: is this documented somewhere? I am just considering having my own collection objects implemented which would work with jQuery.each out of the box. So they would also have indexes which should not be manipulated by convention
[15:03:47] <m_gol> Danwe_WMDE: let's go to #jquery with that

[21:48:47] <rworth> JamesMGreene sorry - you have your own room :)
[21:49:03] <JamesMGreene> rworth: For real?
[21:49:07] <rworth> yeah, we all do
[21:49:14] <rworth> are you here?
[21:49:21] <rworth> or you arrive tomorrow?
[21:49:22] <JamesMGreene> No, not till tomorrow afternoon
[21:49:25] <rworth> ok
[21:49:41] <JamesMGreene> Well that's pretty awesome, I thought we were going to be doubled up
[21:49:56] <JamesMGreene> (not that THAT couldn't have also been awesome)
[21:51:04] <JamesMGreene> How long is the MAX ride from PDX to [near] the hotel?
[21:54:55] <Eviltwin> Oh, conference
[21:55:06] <Eviltwin> I should join one of those at some point
[21:55:49] <JamesMGreene> Looks like ~25 minutes from PDX to Lloyd Center, yes?
[21:56:05] <JamesMGreene> Eviltwin: Seems like it ;)
[22:17:19] * JamesMGreene is oddly perplexed as to why `QUnit.assert` is exporting into the global space (`global.assert`) of Node.js instead of just on the `exports` object...
[22:31:34] <JamesMGreene> Oh, duh
[22:31:48] <JamesMGreene> It's not from QUnit, it's from the custom Grunt task
[22:33:50] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle|detached: Any thoughts on updating all the core QUnit unit tests to NOT use the globally exposed methods?  Obviously we still want to test those in the browser but perhaps in a separate suite...?
