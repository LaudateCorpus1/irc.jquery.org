[11:55:10] <m_gol-> wat, I seemto be banned somewhere
[12:38:18] <m_gol-> gnarf: ping me when you're available plz
[12:50:01] <m_gol-> DaveMethvin: still here?
[12:50:12] <DaveMethvin> yep
[12:50:28] <m_gol-> Could you have a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/pull/121?
[12:51:01] <DaveMethvin> yep, lgtm

[12:55:52] <m_gol-> DaveMethvin: thx, landed
[12:56:42] <DaveMethvin> m_gol-: i suspect it will still fail early since the attribute changes in jquery-git are going to trip it up
[12:57:01] <DaveMethvin> but it won't be your fault! :)
[12:57:26] <DaveMethvin> so did you figure out why your normal m_gol doesn't work? Is it banned here?
[12:59:44] <m_gol-> DaveMethvin: I'm banned on #node.js, not sure why as I wasn't really interacting there a lot. But I changed the office today so maybe an IP-based ban is in place
[13:00:00] <DaveMethvin> ok
[13:11:49] <m_gol-> markelog DaveMethvin timmywil: can we agree to not force-push to 2.2-stable from now on? force-pushing to 1.12-stable is fine until markelog finishes the job he did for 2.2-stable before
[13:12:00] <m_gol-> gibson042 ^

[13:21:14] <m_gol-> DaveMethvin: https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.x-git.js will appear in a minute
[13:21:22] <m_gol-> minified versions are there as wekk
[13:21:24] <m_gol-> * as well
[13:22:22] <DaveMethvin> thanks m_gol- !
[13:27:03] <JamesMGreene> Hey leobalter jzaefferer gibson042 Krinkle: just a quick note that I had to publish an updated release of https://github.com/JamesMGreene/grunt-qunitnode to get it working with QUnit >= 1.19
[13:28:11] <JamesMGreene> https://github.com/JamesMGreene/grunt-qunitnode/compare/98ecd6ff1c5fa02da3c314e6839c7afd72c0382d...v1.0.0
[13:28:27] <JamesMGreene> Mostly just because `QUnit.init` was no longer accessible in non-browser environments
[13:28:43] <JamesMGreene> o/
[13:31:22] <timmywil> m_gol-: fine with me

[21:40:47] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[21:41:08] <DaveMethvin> hey m_gol did you notice the migrate project at least got close?
[21:41:15] <m_gol> :D
[21:41:19] <m_gol> I wanted to ask
[21:41:28] <m_gol> on what branch do you prepare Migrate 2?
[21:41:58] <DaveMethvin> you mean migrate 3?
[21:42:02] <DaveMethvin> i haven't started one
[21:42:31] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I mean the one meant for Core 1.12/2.2
[21:42:40] <DaveMethvin> it's on master
[21:42:42] <m_gol> you asked me to turn on jquery-2.x-git.js etc.
[21:42:43] <m_gol> k
[21:42:49] <m_gol> so I'd apply one other change
[21:42:50] <DaveMethvin> there's only one migrate for both
[21:43:01] <m_gol> the key jquery under test should be changed to jquery-2
[21:43:15] <m_gol> so that you have jquery-1 & jquery-2 and not jquery-1 & jquery
[21:43:25] <m_gol> since it takes the name of the key as the name of the browserSet to use
[21:43:45] <m_gol> and Migrate should be tested on all browsers supported by jQuery 2.2, not just by the one supported by 3.0
[21:43:47] <DaveMethvin> ah ok
[21:43:50] <m_gol> can I apply that change?
[21:43:52] <DaveMethvin> sure
[21:43:54] <m_gol> k
[21:44:00] <DaveMethvin> thanks for catching that
[21:48:55] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I also updated 1.11.2/2.1.3 to 1.11.3/2.1.4

[21:49:02] <jqcommit> 13jquery-migrate/06master 14d8b8434 15MichaÅ‚ GoÅ‚Ä™biowski: Tests: Update jQueries 1.11.2/2.1.3 to 1.11.3/2.1.4
[21:49:13] <m_gol> btw, no wonder IE6-7 is failing since Migrate was never tested on them... ;)
[21:49:41] <m_gol> the branch 1.12-stable is in the state from 1.11.3 so theoretically it should work, perhaps something needs to be fixed in Migrate or its tests
[21:49:49] <DaveMethvin> i tested it manually, but looks like a couple of fails
[21:50:01] <DaveMethvin> one is the XSS and the other a pretty obscure attr one
[21:53:28] <m_gol> on the bright side, 2.2 tests are mostly fixed
[21:54:18] <DaveMethvin> and working in migrate! http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1725
