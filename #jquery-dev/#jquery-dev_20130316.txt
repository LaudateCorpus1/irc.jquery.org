[10:39:45] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: is there a reason we use $.contains to see if an element is disconnected over just walking up the parentNode tree?
[10:40:39] <mikesherov> I know it isn't much of a bottleneck, but the second method is about 5X faster, and in some tight loops it might matter: http://jsperf.com/is-the-element-in-the-document
[10:41:23] <DaveMethvin> probably because we thought the perf would be the opposite!
[10:41:25] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov
[10:41:38] <DaveMethvin> a loop in js vs a function call to native code
[10:44:49] <mikesherov> no behavioral difference you can think of though? DaveMethvin
[10:45:59] <DaveMethvin> since sizzle uses it heavily we should bring gibson042 and timmywil in on this dission
[10:46:02] <DaveMethvin> discussino
[10:46:06] <DaveMethvin> whatev
[10:46:09] <mikesherov> ha
[10:46:26] <mikesherov> discussino is the italian word for discussion
[10:46:36] * DaveMethvin gestures with hands
[10:46:52] <DaveMethvin> i can kind of understand why a loop might be faster
[10:47:09] <DaveMethvin> $.contains will often use compareDocumentPosition which answers a more general question
[10:47:18] <mikesherov> right
[10:47:32] <mikesherov> so there's definitely some traversal there
[10:48:17] <DaveMethvin> and in the real code i guess it would be elem.ownerDocument
[10:48:36] <mikesherov> oh, I should do that
[10:50:24] <mikesherov> still much faster
[10:51:15] <DaveMethvin> so maybe it makes sense to have some specialized fns for specific questions rather than always using $.contains
[10:52:14] <mikesherov> right
[10:52:45] <DaveMethvin> well the fallback is to use that code anyway https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/sizzle.js#L602
[10:52:59] <DaveMethvin> so it seems like a deoptimization
[10:53:24] <mikesherov> hmmmm
[10:53:35] <mikesherov> I'm sure there's an edge case somewhere?
[10:53:41] <DaveMethvin> maybe the code can be SMALLER!
[10:53:45] <mikesherov> someone had to test the speed of this thing
[10:53:59] <DaveMethvin> it may have evolved to this
[10:54:09] <mikesherov> like a good neighbor, gibson042 is there
[10:54:10] <DaveMethvin> and maybe it was slower at some point
[10:54:16] <mikesherov> damn, didn't work
[10:54:25] <mikesherov> gibson042 didn't magically appear
[10:54:27] <DaveMethvin> lol
[10:54:42] <DaveMethvin> i need optimization, so person come help!
[10:54:49] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[10:54:55] <DaveMethvin> (random internet troll appears)
[10:57:16] <DaveMethvin> affects sortOrder as well https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/sizzle.js#L624
[10:58:45] <mikesherov> so I buy that for sortOrder, native will be faster, but for contains, doesn't look like it
[11:00:06] <DaveMethvin> right since we need to know more than just whether it's contained
[11:04:07] <mikesherov> hmmm
[11:04:20] <mikesherov> but looks like it starts with the native <Node>.contains
[11:07:30] <mikesherov> which is STILL SLOWER
[11:07:33] <mikesherov> weird
[11:08:10] <DaveMethvin> yep, gotta ask our sizzlers about that
[11:08:24] <mikesherov> k
[11:09:31] <mikesherov> bot-t: tell gibson042 take a look at this, and let me know if you think Sizzle.contains should just do parentNode traversal always: http://jsperf.com/is-the-element-in-the-document
[11:09:32] <bot-t> mikesherov, Okay.
[11:09:59] <mikesherov> timmywil: take a look at this, and let me know if you think Sizzle.contains should just do parentNode traversal always: http://jsperf.com/is-the-element-in-the-document
[14:22:07] <DaveMethvin> NameVirtualHost has no effect http://wnd8.com/grab/7ceaf6.png
[16:34:30] <arcanis> hi, is there a policy about prefixed functionalities in jQuery support ?
[16:35:03] <arcanis> I'm currently working on the Mouse lock API, but it seems that the movementX/Y properties are not available from a jQuery event handler
[16:36:07] <arcanis> so I was wondering : can I make a pull request to fix it, or is it something that should not belong to the jquery core ?
[18:31:19] <DaveMethvin> arcanis use event.originalEvnet
[18:31:24] <DaveMethvin> originalEvent
[19:12:20] <danheberden> eventOriginal√©
[19:51:21] <arcanis> DaveMethvin, thanks :)
