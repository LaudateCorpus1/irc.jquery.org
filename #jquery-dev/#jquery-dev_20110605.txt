[07:26:35] <Jakey> hello
[07:26:39] <davidwalsh> Hello sir
[07:26:47] <Jakey> i'm no sir sir
[07:26:51] <Jakey> but you sir are sir :)
[08:33:20] <rick-_> ?
[08:33:24] <rick-_> yikes
[08:46:47] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt
[08:46:49] <rwaldron> ?
[08:46:58] <DaveMethvin> yep
[08:47:04] <rwaldron> hey dude
[08:47:10] <DaveMethvin> hey, sup?
[08:47:21] <rwaldron> so, I was just looking at docs#9463
[08:47:29] <rwaldron> ...
[08:47:34] <rwaldron> okaaay.
[08:47:36] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9463
[08:48:00] <rwaldron> anyway, I looked at the fiddle and then did some research: http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/BNcty/
[08:48:35] <rwaldron> so, of course its sort of silly to file a ticket for $("<textarea>").attr("type") or $("<select>").attr("type")
[08:48:46] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[08:48:53] <rwaldron> because they don't have type "attributes"
[08:48:54] <DaveMethvin> if you can't see the attr in the html markup it isn't there
[08:49:00] <rwaldron> right
[08:49:05] <DaveMethvin> what the browser assumes to make the property is another story
[08:49:08] <rwaldron> but the third is cause for concern
[08:49:21] <rwaldron> $("<input>").attr("type") is legit
[08:49:27] <rwaldron> but is undefined?
[08:49:39] <DaveMethvin> it is if a type isn't specified :)
[08:49:47] <rwaldron> OHHHh snap
[08:49:50] <rwaldron> you're SO RIGHT
[08:49:52] <rwaldron> whoops!
[08:49:55] <rwaldron> :D
[08:50:00] <DaveMethvin> that's why prop is good!
[08:50:05] * rwaldron drinks coffee
[08:50:08] <rwaldron> duh
[08:50:26] <DaveMethvin> and of course, the type attr can be "number" but the type prop can be "text" on older browsers
[08:51:46] <rwaldron> right right
[08:51:49] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/BNcty/
[08:52:02] <rwaldron> I'm trying to make this fiddle crystal clear to help these guys on the ticket
[08:52:06] <rwaldron> they seem upset.
[08:53:50] <rwaldron> updated: http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/BNcty/
[08:54:07] <rwaldron> more information about each of the HTML*Element constructor objects.
[08:58:27] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: some other examples: http://jsfiddle.net/BNcty/4/
[08:58:55] <rwaldron> cool, should I add those or just link seperately?
[08:59:06] <DaveMethvin> separate link i guess
[08:59:12] <rwaldron> cool.
[10:50:47] <timmywil> we've had several tickets related to docs#9033, but I'm having trouble writing a test case
[10:52:11] <timmywil> ?tell jaubourg http://grab.by/ahXn  perhaps something like this
[10:52:20] <timmywil> arg
[15:37:08] <ajpiano> whewwwwwwwwwwwwww voting complete
[15:38:42] <rwaldron> +1 to ajpiano, he's a core dude.
[15:38:57] <ajpiano> hehe
[19:29:56] <ryanneufeld> anyone know how to make bot-t come back?
