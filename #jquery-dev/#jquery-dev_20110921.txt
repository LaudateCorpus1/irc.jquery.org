[02:14:31] <jaubourg> plop
[02:15:23] <aaronmcadam> haha poo
[02:15:29] <jaubourg> ?tell DaveMethvin I'll be in boston for nearly 20 days after the conf so I'll be there for the meeting
[02:15:29] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[04:55:26] <gnarf> anyone awake?
[04:56:44] <jaubourg> yep
[04:56:47] <jaubourg> ^^
[04:57:07] <gnarf> awesome
[04:57:42] <gnarf> I'm thinking about how best to handle this .delay() bug
[04:58:02] <gnarf> and also ran into some other things...
[04:58:37] <gnarf> docs#6150
[04:58:40] <bot-t> [#6150] .stop sometimes doesn't clear .delay (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/6150
[04:58:50] <gnarf> so, one thing I noticed which is gonna bug me
[04:58:56] <gnarf> stop doesn't accept a queue param
[04:59:03] <gnarf> it literally just stops ALL animations
[04:59:09] <gnarf> so you could never stop a single queue
[04:59:40] <gnarf> Now that animate can actually be on multiple queues, I'm wondering if I should add a queue to stop
[05:00:52] <gnarf> also, i'm curious if this approach for the stop bug seems worthwhile: https://gist.github.com/b235d1ca123d73cc5567 - should I maybe try to leverage $.Callbacks ?
[05:04:31] <jaubourg> sorry, was with my work buddy on a little js problem
[05:05:14] <jaubourg> if we switch to $.Callbacks, we will probably get crucified for not giving access to the internal array anymore
[05:05:58] <gnarf> i was talking more about switching to $.Callbacks for the stop/complete stuff
[05:06:03] <gnarf> maybe even $.Deferred
[05:06:38] <gnarf> stop can be a reject / done can be a resolve
[05:07:30] <jaubourg> creating a deferred everytime we initiate an animation would have to be per element and performance cost on big collections will be enormous (hence why I created deferred on demand when generating promises using fn.promise)
[05:08:00] <jaubourg> at least that's what I believe, maybe it wouldn't be that big of an impact
[05:12:34] <gnarf> what do you think of storing a "stop" function per the queue
[05:15:19] <jaubourg> could work
[05:17:00] <gnarf> i don't think there's ever a reason to have more than one
[05:20:25] <gnarf> so this stop() inconsistency is gonna bug me i think
[05:20:34] <gnarf> currently it kills all timers
[05:50:08] <gnarf> hrm
[05:50:13] <gnarf> i think i might of got this branch working
[06:29:40] <gnarf> hrm
[06:43:28] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/zb6ZEg
[06:43:28] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Remove the rarely-used pseudos from quickis.html - Dave Methvin
[06:52:27] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: you cannot hide!
[06:52:37] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg!
[06:52:37] <bot-t> (4 hours 37 mins ago) <jaubourg> tell DaveMethvin I'll be in boston for nearly 20 days after the conf so I'll be there for the meeting
[06:52:43] <DaveMethvin> sweet!
[06:52:46] <jaubourg> :)
[06:52:59] <DaveMethvin> so do you ever sleep?
[06:53:31] <jaubourg> I do and I'm on my gf's schedule right now so I go to bed early and wake up in the morning
[06:53:40] <jaubourg> I'm going soft
[06:53:42] <jaubourg> ;)
[06:53:45] <DaveMethvin> gettin old
[06:53:56] <jaubourg> that I was already doing :P
[06:54:00] <addyosmani> jaubourg? on a regular schedule?
[06:54:04] <addyosmani> its a modern day miracle :D
[06:54:13] <DaveMethvin> hey addyosmani i like your idea of some release notes
[06:54:20] <addyosmani> thanks DaveMethvin
[06:54:33] <jaubourg> what idea?
[06:54:33] <DaveMethvin> i had it on my list of things to do, we need to highlight all the changes so ppl can test them
[06:54:36] <addyosmani> I wasn't sure whether to push those as a release preview this week or wait until release date
[06:54:38] <jaubourg> <= curious mode on
[06:54:44] <addyosmani> oh. one sec
[06:54:58] <addyosmani> http://oksoclap.com/releasepreview
[06:55:09] <DaveMethvin> i had said something about trying to do  beta tomorrow but i don't think all the parts will have landed
[06:55:20] <DaveMethvin> maybe we could do a beta after the meeting on monday?
[06:55:29] <DaveMethvin> that will give us time to review and land everything
[06:55:31] <addyosmani> Sounds like a plan
[06:55:54] <jaubourg> I still need a proper review of $.Callbacks
[06:55:57] <jaubourg> ;)
[06:56:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's a great start addy!
[06:56:19] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: i did a quick look and was thinking of what we could trim to keep the size down
[06:56:37] <DaveMethvin> we are actually pretty close to having this be the first major release that is smaller than the one before
[06:56:47] <DaveMethvin> so it would be a nice thing to be able to say
[06:57:11] <jaubourg> let me know... I'm sure I could squeeze more in deferred.js itself
[06:57:16] <jaubourg> but I lack time right now
[06:57:26] <DaveMethvin> do you have use cases for removeFail etc?
[06:57:52] <DaveMethvin> i can see the need to remove events since they last a while but for promises not so much
[06:57:55] <jaubourg> well, use cases no, but the fact it was missing came right in my face when doing progress
[06:58:32] <addyosmani> Im sure I missed this, but was the final call on $.Callbacks that we were going to delegate pub/sub stuff to plugin or actually integrate, jaubourg?
[06:58:41] <addyosmani> *leave integrated
[06:58:43] <DaveMethvin> i think we went plugin
[06:58:44] <jaubourg> plugin for now
[06:58:50] <DaveMethvin> which saves a few bytes
[06:59:03] <addyosmani> cool
[06:59:04] <DaveMethvin> i've cut a ton of stuff from event
[06:59:25] <DaveMethvin> without cutting features
[06:59:30] <jaubourg> Dave: I just said to myself: ok, I need removeProgress.... why on earth wouldn't I have a removeDone and removeFail?
[06:59:48] <DaveMethvin> you can always add them later
[07:00:04] <jaubourg> I could prolly render this part of code generic and save a lot of bytes
[07:00:09] <DaveMethvin> even removeprogress isn't essential?
[07:00:28] <jaubourg> well, it is, it's like registering to an event
[07:00:38] <DaveMethvin> true, so that one should stay
[07:00:44] <jaubourg> you wanna be able to unregister
[07:00:56] <jaubourg> how bigger are we right now?
[07:01:05] <jaubourg> (1.6 vs 1.7)
[07:01:06] <DaveMethvin> i think gnarf said it was like 10 bytes
[07:01:16] <jaubourg> gzipped?
[07:01:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah the gzip site
[07:01:24] <jaubourg> that'll be hell to get
[07:01:25] <DaveMethvin> size
[07:01:46] <DaveMethvin> i cut a couple of things this morning lemme see where we stand
[07:02:51] <jaubourg> regarding $.Callbacks flags, I could remove queue and possibly relocate (though I think it could be useful
[07:02:56] <jaubourg> )
[07:04:14] <DaveMethvin> 1.7 is currently 15 bytes bigger
[07:04:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah i wondered about all the flags jaubourg
[07:04:53] <DaveMethvin> do those have current use cases? If not i'd remove them and we can add if someone needs it
[07:05:08] <jaubourg> I tried to be thourough... remember what Yehuda said about needing to relocate callbacks?
[07:05:19] <jaubourg> but yeah, I can trim it
[07:05:25] <DaveMethvin> from a style standpoint though, we don't have a lot of apis like that
[07:05:25] <jaubourg> let me try that
[07:05:56] <DaveMethvin> sweet
[07:06:13] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[07:06:17] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron did you get in trouble with rose?
[07:06:19] <jaubourg> yeah, I was hesitant about the api but I felt like forcing people to create options like this: { flag1: true, flag2: true } was a bit much
[07:06:21] <rwaldron> i think clone + object = exception
[07:06:30] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin nope! was on time
[07:06:35] <jaubourg> wat? trouble with rose?
[07:06:40] <jaubourg> \o/
[07:06:46] <DaveMethvin> he was with his mistress, jquery
[07:06:57] <jaubourg> she's so goddam sexy
[07:07:02] <jaubourg> rwaldron: don't forget me :P
[07:07:13] <timmywil> rwaldron: hi!
[07:07:18] <rwaldron> jaubourg i had to leave to pick up rose in the middle of a rendezvous with jQuery
[07:07:22] <DaveMethvin> i am so pumped about 1.7 and i have this damned paying work to do, such a shame
[07:07:23] <rwaldron> timmywil hi!
[07:07:25] <rwaldron> :)
[07:07:40] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yeah, same here
[07:08:08] <DaveMethvin> so i have to go play with that but will try to review the stuff that hasn't landed
[07:08:13] <rwaldron> all i want to do is test it, try out new event stuff, play with callbacks, write performance tests etc
[07:08:36] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin real quick, were does event prop hooks stand?
[07:08:56] <timmywil> rwaldron: strange that only IE9 has an issue
[07:09:05] <timmywil> clone + object
[07:09:05] <DaveMethvin> i haven't looked at them since you made your changes, lemme scan the diff
[07:09:21] <rwaldron> timmywil i'm trying to put together the pieces
[07:09:46] <rwaldron> i know that object elems are not clone friendly
[07:10:02] <rwaldron> i think they crash archaic IEs or something awful
[07:10:19] <timmywil> ew
[07:10:31] <DaveMethvin> well we know you can't attach data to them
[07:10:45] <DaveMethvin> objects aren't DOM elements really are they?
[07:10:50] <DaveMethvin> in ie that is
[07:11:17] <rwaldron> correct
[07:11:31] <DaveMethvin> i think the reason it works in old jquery is that we used to use innerHTML to clone it
[07:11:36] <rwaldron> we classify them in the "rnocache" check
[07:11:56] <rwaldron> shiiiittt
[07:12:07] <rwaldron> snover and I re-wrote all that
[07:12:10] <DaveMethvin> right
[07:12:14] <DaveMethvin> which is good
[07:12:35] <DaveMethvin> the innerhtml way had a LOT of problems
[07:12:45] <DaveMethvin> but i guess cloning objects wasn't one of them :P
[07:13:42] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron did you update your pull request for the event property hooks? I don't see any updates
[07:16:29] * jaubourg is squashing bytes out of jQuery
[07:16:39] <timmywil> jaubourg: yay!
[07:16:48] <timmywil> rm -rf bytes
[07:18:02] <jaubourg> lol
[07:18:16] <jaubourg> removed relocate, queue and addAfterFire flags
[07:18:32] <jaubourg> about to go into deferred.js
[07:19:23] <jaubourg> hmmm, I broke something in effects.js
[07:20:03] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin it's totally up to date
[07:20:05] <rwaldron> lemme look
[07:21:08] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin the last update was the removal of pageX/Y from the standard prop list
[07:21:58] <DaveMethvin> oh i missed the comit at the bottom
[07:23:18] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron i still want to understand why the hooks need to be called two places
[07:23:21] <DaveMethvin> i would think fix shoudl do it
[07:23:40] <DaveMethvin> not sure why an un-fixed event would bail out of fix since the expando shoudn't have been set
[07:23:53] <jaubourg> hmmm, could be a cache problem
[07:24:34] <DaveMethvin> man i hate those kinda problems
[07:24:55] <DaveMethvin> anyway i need to get going on some work before the west coast wakes up
[07:25:00] <DaveMethvin> "The cutting will continue until file size is improved"
[07:26:32] <jaubourg> gnarf: did you break some tests in effects?
[07:26:46] <jaubourg> or is it chrome acting up AGAIN
[07:32:22] <rwaldron> timmywil DaveMethvin yt?
[07:33:02] <rwaldron> I have no way of testing IE9 :(
[07:33:23] <DaveMethvin> i have ie9 rwaldron
[07:33:28] <rwaldron> (aside from needing to fix that...)
[07:33:42] <rwaldron> in jQuery.clone(), there is a special path that IE6,7,8 would follow
[07:33:45] <DaveMethvin> but i'll need to wait until later today at least, maybe tonight
[07:33:56] <rwaldron> but i was certain IE9 didnt follow that path
[07:33:58] <rwaldron> ok
[07:34:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah i thought ie9 didn't need to
[07:34:03] <rwaldron> right
[07:34:46] <DaveMethvin> what's the feature detect it uses? maybe that fires on ie9 when it shoudl not
[07:40:41] <rwaldron> !jQuery.support.noCloneEvent || !jQuery.support.noCloneChecked
[07:40:55] <rwaldron> (elem.nodeType === 1 || elem.nodeType === 11) && !jQuery.isXMLDoc(elem)
[07:45:43] <gnarf> jaubourg: afaik i haven't broken anything
[07:46:35] <gnarf> If anyone wants to peek into this: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/compare/1.7-queue-refactor - It has more than a few changes...
[07:46:51] <gnarf> one thing that I'm wondering
[07:47:17] <gnarf> do we need to support .stop() on specific queues, or should it (as it always has done) just stop ALL animations, and send the "stop" to all queues?
[07:54:53] <jaubourg> weird, when I test modules separately, everything is fine
[07:55:01] <jaubourg> when I do all the run, bang
[08:01:23] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/gBq3Gg
[08:01:23] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Trimmed down $.Callbacks and $.Deferred. - jaubourg
[08:01:32] <jaubourg> 32947 says make
[08:02:26] <jaubourg> and I even added isProgressing to deferred in the process
[08:02:31] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: ^^
[08:03:29] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: you made it smaller!
[08:03:32] <DaveMethvin> oh no
[08:03:46] <jaubourg> yep, some stuff in effects and offsets fail in the unit tests, but not if the modules are ran separately
[08:03:48] <jaubourg> \o/
[08:03:59] <DaveMethvin> screw the unit tests, it's smaller :P
[08:04:04] <jaubourg> haha
[08:04:36] <DaveMethvin> ok back to work
[08:07:02] <rwaldron> gnarf isnt that something that timmywil _just_ landed?
[08:08:49] <timmywil> jaubourg: woot
[08:08:49] <timmywil> jQuery Size - compared to last make
[08:08:49] <timmywil>   245183  (-2484) jquery.js
[08:08:49] <timmywil>    93080   (-879) jquery.min.js
[08:08:49] <timmywil>    32947   (-291) jquery.min.js.gz
[08:09:07] <timmywil> rwaldron: i haven't landed any stop changes
[08:09:21] <timmywil> the queue is in tho
[08:10:04] <gnarf> rwaldron: isn't what?
[08:11:34] <rwaldron> timmywil gnarf http://code.bocoup.com/jquery1-7/#qUnique1
[08:11:41] <rwaldron> thats what i was thinking of
[08:11:43] <rwaldron> nevermind
[08:21:35] <gnarf> hrm
[08:21:40] <gnarf> this is kinda upsetting
[08:22:08] <gnarf> if i dig any deeper in here there are all sorts of things cropping up
[08:38:54] <gnarf> why is stop() putting a pin in my plans :/
[08:40:47] <gnarf> timmywil: do you have a thought about multiple queues?
[08:40:52] <gnarf> and stop?
[08:43:33] <timmywil> gnarf: i like it as long as it's short :)
[08:43:43] <gnarf> yeah.....
[08:43:56] <gnarf> im at like +310 min on the branch right now
[08:44:09] <gnarf> :/
[08:45:22] <jaubourg> hmmm
[08:45:36] <gnarf> right now its just trying to figure out what to do with .stop() without passing a queue
[08:45:56] <jaubourg> my gf only wants to see me if and when I've done what I needed to regarding jQuery and my talk
[08:46:05] <jaubourg> I find it kind of cool if not a bit depressing :P
[08:46:54] <timmywil> jaubourg: maybe that means be done now? :)
[08:46:56] <gnarf> +301....
[08:47:20] <jaubourg> timmy: oh no it doesn't
[08:47:27] <jaubourg> gnarf: that bad?
[08:47:52] <jaubourg> hey steve
[08:49:47] <gnarf> jaubourg: yeah, hooking in on stop is proving to not be simple
[08:49:56] <gnarf> lots of strangeness in our queues
[08:49:57] <gnarf> :(
[08:51:13] <jaubourg> man, did you know that "queue" is a way to say "dick" in french?
[08:51:22] <jaubourg> so I, as a french, am not surprised ;)
[08:51:38] <gnarf> heh
[08:51:51] <gnarf> I'm not sure why its exploding this much
[08:51:59] <gnarf> but like nothing "simple" seems to work
[08:52:18] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/compare/1.7-queue-refactor
[08:52:35] <gnarf> basically - the weight comes in from adding the new way of "stopping" other than jQuery.timers
[08:53:16] <jaubourg> how about making custom queues non stoppable until we refactor effects for 1.8?
[08:55:25] <gnarf> doesn't clean up much... but then that doesn't help me solve my UI effects bugs either
[08:58:00] <jaubourg> heh
[08:59:35] <gnarf> the stop per animation queue / ALL animations when undefined is less intense than the extra loop added for "stop hooks"
[08:59:55] <gnarf> i tried to use my new loop for the animation too, but then timers don't get cleaned properly
[09:02:57] <jaubourg> I feel for you gnarf but I have to fly right now
[09:03:10] <jaubourg> I catch you later and we try and see what we can cook?
[09:05:14] <rwaldron> docs#10202 is making me crazy
[09:05:16] <bot-t> [#10202] `data` attribute disappears from settings for ajax GET requests (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/10202
[09:05:25] <rwaldron> s/attribute/property/
[09:06:23] <gnarf> it gets added to the url doesn't it?
[09:06:33] <gnarf> url encoded?
[09:24:37] <gnarf> you could fix it with a prefilter probably
[09:24:39] <gnarf> rwaldron:
[09:24:59] <gnarf> or just clone the data key
[09:25:06] <gnarf> data: data, storedData: data
[09:25:22] <gnarf> even on a POST it urlencodes data:
[09:25:36] <gnarf> and has done that behavior since the dawn of ajax as far as i can recall
[09:27:14] <rwaldron> gnarf no, i jsut hated that the OP called it a "attribute"
[09:27:17] <rwaldron> just*
[09:27:21] <gnarf> lolz
[09:27:24] <rwaldron> when they meant "property"
[09:27:28] <rwaldron> i changed the subject
[09:27:32] <rwaldron> in theticket
[09:32:32] <gnarf> timmywil / rwaldron / DaveMethvin : https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/compare/1.7-queue-refactor --- worth the 306 minified / 115 min.gz bytes?
[09:32:44] <gnarf> i can probably golf it a bit
[09:34:05] <DaveMethvin> so gnarf how do you feel about the changes?
[09:34:25] <gnarf> like its halfway to where i want it
[09:34:29] <DaveMethvin> i feel like a shrink ... "and how do you FEEL about that" :P
[09:34:31] <gnarf> but it lets me solve bugs
[09:34:37] <DaveMethvin> well that's a plus
[09:34:58] <gnarf> i don't think anything short of a gut/rewrite on this will solve it any better
[09:35:07] <gnarf> the timers and the ways we use them just breaks
[09:35:17] <DaveMethvin> which i guess will come with the 1.8 effects stuff?
[09:35:37] <gnarf> yeah
[09:35:49] <gnarf> I can prolly golf a few more bytes out here
[09:35:55] <DaveMethvin> so give that a try
[09:36:04] <gnarf> but like its still gonna be 300 prolly
[09:36:18] <DaveMethvin> originally i was thinking we might be able to do a beta this week but maybe we could wait until monday
[09:36:29] <DaveMethvin> that gives us all time to land functionality
[09:36:45] <DaveMethvin> i would like a long beta for this since we changed so much
[09:37:01] <gnarf> this is my last blocker
[09:37:01] <DaveMethvin> but of course the beta only helps if we have everything landed
[09:37:14] <DaveMethvin> most of what i have left is just little odds and ends
[09:37:27] <DaveMethvin> i also need to be sure i didn't introduce any ie memory leaks
[09:38:02] <DaveMethvin> the ticket graph is impressive
[09:38:11] <DaveMethvin> maybe we can get down to 150
[09:38:18] <DaveMethvin> i have about 6 to close
[09:42:08] <gnarf> ooo
[09:42:18] <gnarf> golfed -47/-10/-3
[09:42:38] <gnarf> so, under 300
[09:42:40] <gnarf> barely ;)
[09:44:06] <gnarf> i.indexOf(".run") === i.length - 4
[09:44:08] <gnarf> feels long
[09:44:18] <gnarf> but prolly fastest
[10:18:45] <gnarf> i feel like a jerk suggesting like 700 bytes of injection
[10:18:57] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i want it to be smaller too!!! :)
[10:19:26] <DaveMethvin> that's NOT what she said
[10:19:39] * gnarf winks
[10:25:37] <borismoore_> Chrome crashed!

[11:25:52] <DaveMethvin> chrome crashes a *lot* on me lately, especially while debugging
[11:28:51] <timmywil> this is awesome http://peepcode.com/products/peepopen
[11:31:34] <gnarf> timmywil: RE: p513 ( was p508 ) if I remove the ability for "expand" to parse the strings, it cuts the code impact a bit btw
[11:33:07] <timmywil> gnarf: cool
[11:33:28] <gnarf> still >300bytes tho
[12:01:29] <gnarf> for 60 / 29 bytes we can have margin: "20px 100px" actually work
[12:01:50] <gnarf> hell .animate({ margin: "+=10px -=10px" }) would work too
[12:02:59] <gnarf> why do these two pulls need so many characters :/
