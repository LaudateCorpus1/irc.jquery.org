[05:45:37] <jaubourg> hi there
[05:47:51] <jaubourg> danheberden: you don't speak at jqcon? :(
[05:50:02] <addyosmani> he's too busy danheberdering :)
[05:51:17] <jaubourg> well, and YOU my friend, are busy addyosmaning
[05:51:27] <addyosmani> SOMEONE has to do it :D
[05:51:38] <jaubourg> jeez, what devil possess you nowadays? ;)
[05:52:12] <addyosmani> the ghost of JavaScript past, my friend. He says hello()!
[05:52:30] <addyosmani> that was a terrible terrible, joke.
[05:52:36] <addyosmani> I apologize!
[05:53:24] <jaubourg> lol
[05:53:50] <jaubourg> you even know of conferences I never heard of... in my fucking own country of residence :P
[05:53:54] <addyosmani> haha
[05:54:08] <addyosmani> It must not be a very well known one, then!
[05:54:16] <jaubourg> apparently, it is
[05:54:50] <addyosmani> I'll hopefully get to see you around!
[05:54:57] <jaubourg> it's just that I'm stuck in my cave, re-inventing the wheel, while you travel and have all the girls... and champagne... and things I cannot even imagine!
[05:55:12] <jaubourg> you MI6 agent you
[05:55:13] <addyosmani> you mean just the travel, then :P
[05:55:24] <addyosmani> Married plus on a diet means onnnly the travel
[05:55:30] <addyosmani> :D
[05:55:37] <jaubourg> on a diet, seriously?
[05:55:46] <addyosmani> Yeah. I need to trim down, man
[05:56:01] <jaubourg> haha, well I need to super-trim then :P
[05:56:31] <addyosmani> lol. It's all part of the jaubourg charm.
[05:56:36] <jaubourg> so anyway, any plan to stay a bit longer in belgium?
[05:56:43] <addyosmani> I may well try!
[05:56:47] <jaubourg> so that we can, like, hang out or something ;)
[05:56:53] <addyosmani> I'll see if work will let me stretch it to a few days
[05:57:03] <jaubourg> it's in November, right?
[05:57:10] <addyosmani> or like..fake near-death illness. Whatever gets me off the hook :D
[05:57:13] <addyosmani> yep
[05:57:20] <jaubourg> good, I'll be back from the US
[05:57:39] <jaubourg> oh btw, you wouldn't happen to have a nice half hour introduction talk about jQuery?
[05:58:09] <jaubourg> I have to give one at the Riviera conf and I already have 2 to prepare (one on $.Callbacks, the other on Deferred client & server-side)
[05:58:22] <jaubourg> how stupid of me to always propose different talks :/
[05:58:30] <addyosmani> I don't believe so, but I can recommend looking at some of @appendTo's stuff.
[05:58:42] <addyosmani> Sure we can get some of their slides as they're all friends
[05:58:51] <addyosmani> but their site has all the videos
[05:58:53] <addyosmani> you seen it?
[05:58:55] <jaubourg> yep
[05:59:10] <jaubourg> it's the crunching it down to 30 minutes part that has me worried
[05:59:54] <jaubourg> man, I'm just a coder with facial hair... how am I supposed to talk in public? :P
[06:00:04] <addyosmani> mmm. I mean, you can't really cover it all at great depth in that time, but I imagine say 3-4 minutes on each section (or 5-8 on the important ones) could work as a high level/fast overview
[06:00:08] <addyosmani> lol
[06:00:26] <addyosmani> shush man. I heard just how much everyone loved your talk at last year's jqcon
[06:00:30] <addyosmani> you'll do great regardless
[06:00:44] <jaubourg> it's for java coders... and I haven't touched java in years... so it's a bit difficult to gauge what will cause them problems
[06:01:03] <jaubourg> or wow them for that matter
[06:01:50] <addyosmani> is it a generic java conference or for say, more front-enders than backenders?
[06:02:30] <jaubourg> a bit more front-end from what I gathered
[06:03:48] <addyosmani> Thats useful to know. I mean, if they're already more frontend orientated its easier to explain how, where and why jQuery might be useful to them.
[06:03:51] <jaubourg> and btw, did anybody hear if and when google apps users will finally get access to google plus? This is getting quite old ;)
[06:03:56] <addyosmani> lol.
[06:04:03] <addyosmani> I have people in the office with the same problem.
[06:04:21] <addyosmani> So, the issue is that google apps accounts don't actually have user profiles because they're considered business/corp.
[06:04:28] <addyosmani> but plus actually heavily relies on profiles.
[06:04:36] <addyosmani> So I think it might still be a while yet.
[06:05:05] <addyosmani> They should just do something opt-in'ish for app accounts. Sure there are tons of people that want to use +
[06:06:37] <jaubourg> yeah, they made lots of annoucements "in a few weeks", "in a few months"... it's been months now
[06:06:48] <jaubourg> nice way to alienate your paying user base really
[06:09:28] <addyosmani> it really is
[06:09:54] <addyosmani> I think they seriously under-anticipated how successful it might be with paying accts
[11:05:09] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[11:05:50] <timmywil> rwaldron: yo
[11:05:54] <rwaldron> hey dude
[11:06:06] <timmywil> so am i confused?
[11:06:08] <rwaldron> so, i just read your last comment on 9994
[11:06:12] <rwaldron> i think yes
[11:06:18] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L307
[11:06:36] <timmywil> mhmm
[11:06:44] <rwaldron> when this happens, if arguments[0] was any kind of falsy, target is set to an obj lit
[11:06:45] <rwaldron> so...
[11:06:57] <rwaldron> when it gets to that conditional block,
[11:06:59] <timmywil> right, but it's not set to arguments[1], which may not be empty
[11:07:06] <timmywil> so it's not the same
[11:07:11] <rwaldron> if ( typeof target === "boolean" ) ...
[11:08:17] <rwaldron> right, but by the time line 313 happens, if the first arg was "false", 313 will evaluate as false, because "target" is not a boolean
[11:08:41] <rwaldron> so that block can and will ONLY happen when the first arg is truthy
[11:08:51] <rwaldron> and when it's actually a boolean
[11:09:33] <timmywil> well damn, i've been going in circles
[11:09:40] <rwaldron> does it make sense now?
[11:09:53] <rwaldron> its almost silly that it's checking for boolean
[11:09:57] <rwaldron> er... typeof
[11:10:02] <rwaldron> typeof boolean
[11:10:17] <timmywil> so how does $.extend(false, { 'something': 'else' }, { 'some': 'thing' }); get target to be the right thin?
[11:10:19] <rwaldron> because "false" would never even happen
[11:10:28] <rwaldron> that turns into...
[11:10:29] <timmywil> and not an empty object
[11:10:39] <rwaldron> $.extend( {}, { 'something': 'else' }, { 'some': 'thing' });
[11:11:17] <rwaldron> passing "false" is not supported
[11:11:20] <timmywil> ha, brilliant, forgot about infinite args
[11:11:33] <rwaldron> right
[11:11:47] <rwaldron> its one of the better .extend() implementations in that regard
[11:12:07] <rwaldron> i'm not fond of the extend( dest, src )
[11:12:16] <rwaldron> i want...
[11:12:18] <timmywil> so lemme see, would this all still work if || {} was removed?
[11:12:25] <rwaldron> extend( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5....)
[11:12:46] <timmywil> yea, agreed, I just don't use multiple args that often
[11:13:29] <rwaldron> i use it alot to do implicit override stuff
[11:14:10] <rwaldron> hm, i wonder what happens if we replace target = arguments[0] || {}; with target = arguments[0] || false;
[11:14:23] <rwaldron> which would evaluate that block
[11:14:33] <rwaldron> i'm just thinking outloud
[11:14:47] <timmywil> I'm wondering that too, might save a loop right?
[11:14:58] <rwaldron> that would actually satisfy your original thinking
[11:15:29] <rwaldron> hm
[11:15:33] <rwaldron> hat might work well
[11:15:35] <rwaldron> that*
[11:15:45] <rwaldron> because... it would cause deep to be set to false
[11:15:57] <rwaldron> and obviously...
[11:16:02] <rwaldron> $.extend( false, ....)
[11:16:36] <rwaldron> would be, very explicitly, a call that did not want to be deep
[11:16:57] <rwaldron> I think I'm going to highjack bug #10000
[11:17:04] <timmywil> hahaha
[11:17:05] <rwaldron> and dedicate it to the bugs team
[11:17:18] <timmywil> dear bugs team: <3
[11:17:24] <rwaldron> :D
[11:17:34] <rwaldron> i as thinking about actually assigning us a task
[11:17:38] <rwaldron> we'll see
[11:17:42] <rwaldron> 5 more to go
[11:17:55] <rwaldron> with my luck, it will happen whle I'm sleeping
[11:18:00] <timmywil> we might just get spammed 5 times in a min or something
[11:19:00] <rwaldron> yeah
[11:19:04] <rwaldron> here's hoping
[11:19:16] <timmywil> alright, back to folding laundry. thanks for helping me work that out.
[11:19:48] <rwaldron> no problem
[11:19:52] <rwaldron> i did laundry yesterday
[11:20:02] <rwaldron> eek... this is a weird ticket...
[11:20:17] <rwaldron> catch ya later
