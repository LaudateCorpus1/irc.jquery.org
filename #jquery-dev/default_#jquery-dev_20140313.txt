[05:57:15] <manus> Hi folks. Quick question(s) regarding Sizzle's non-support for certain pseudo-selectors, specifically ":hover" (I asked a couple days ago on #jQuery and was told I might have better luck asking here.)--
[05:57:28] <manus> I've read the docs and issues (https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/wiki/Sizzle-Documentation#wiki--selectors , https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/44 , etc.)
[05:57:47] <manus> And I understand the motivation for not adding official support to unsupported browsers, but I'm not convinced that the only solution involves adding special events to the DOM.
[05:58:07] <manus> I'm also not (yet?) convinced that an "unsupported pseudo" syntax error is necessary, even in the browsers that DO natively & correctly support the CSS pseuduselector.
[05:58:23] <manus> *pseudoselector
[05:58:37] <manus> Thirdly, the current decision/implementation is inconsistent. E.g., $('body:hover') works, but $('body:hover').is(':hover') doesn't.. I know querySelectorAll() is being used in the background, but if that works, why disallow the pseudoselector when filtering?
[05:59:46] <manus> Why not just reserve the error for browsers that are known to not support it? And then add a note in the docs?
[06:00:03] <manus> Are there even any jQuery/Sizzle-supported browsers other than IE6 that don't support ":hover" natively?
[06:02:04] <manus> I know IE7+ standards-mode (and we don't support quirks/compatibility mode anyway) does the right thing, at least according to http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/cc848866(v=vs.85).aspx

[13:13:07] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: lol, did you notice the http://colloquy.info/ site displays ads only in Firefox and not in Chrome?
[13:13:25] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: in Chrome it displays a Safari logo and text "welcome Safari user" :D
[13:13:45] <JamesMGreene> lol, no I did not notice that m_gol
[13:14:05] <m_gol> changing user agent is enough to swap the ad for the logo
[13:14:10] <m_gol> IE gets ads as well
[13:14:21] <JamesMGreene> how odd
[13:14:37] <m_gol> any WebKit gets the logo
[13:16:20] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: anyway, how are your ideal IRC searches? :)
[13:21:45] <JamesMGreene> Colloquy looks nice but seems to be buggy
[13:21:56] <JamesMGreene> I can't see the text I am typing
[13:22:05] <JamesMGreene> So I'll probably try Textual next week
[13:37:42] <m_gol> JamesMGreen: constantly, at all? or did the text stop appearing after some time?
