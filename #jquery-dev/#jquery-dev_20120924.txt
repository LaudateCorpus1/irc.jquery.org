[09:00:07] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron timmywil gibson042 mikesherov jaubourg gnarf Meeting time!
[09:33:51] <timmywil> peol: if it's a Sizzle issue, it might be a simple fix
[09:33:58] <timmywil> anyway, bbl
[09:34:00] <peol> timmywil, go grab your lunch. Will you be back later to discuss? :)
[09:34:04] <timmywil> yea
[09:34:23] <peol> Awesome, I'll be here 3-4 hours more until bed. Just ping me when you have time
[09:43:59] <peol> timmywil, rwaldron, DaveMethvin, btw, attribute selector on class works: http://jsfiddle.net/qqvzM/4/
[09:45:37] <DaveMethvin> it just doesn't get mirrored to the .className property ... i ran into that with quickIs back in 1.7 as well.
[09:47:35] <peol> That's what I was suspecting as well, but thought sizzle used getElementByClassName on simple selectors so I never researched it further
[09:51:07] <gibson042> peol DaveMethvin timmywil rwaldron: also of note is http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10791
[09:51:50] <gibson042> for the complete unit tests if nothing else
[09:51:58] <DaveMethvin> did i mention i hate SVG?
[09:52:13] <peol> Haha
[09:52:27] <snover> svg is terrible but it’s not as terrible as it could be
[09:52:33] <peol> gibson042, yeah, that's why I double-checked what we're doing with SVG bugs in -meeting earlier
[09:53:41] <DaveMethvin> that's the problem, snover, if it realized its terrible potential we wouldn't even need to discuss whether it was fixable
[09:53:48] <DaveMethvin> but nooooo
[09:54:32] <snover> i guess the thing is that svg doesn’t need a helper library like jquery
[11:37:14] <ryanneufeld> Seems to me that the SVG components would be better served Via a plugin/overlay than in core
[11:37:29] <ryanneufeld> I'd be curious to know how many people use SVG/jQuery
[12:03:50] <peol> ryanneufeld, I'm sure there's quite a lot relying on plugins at this point. Most issues with basic SVG stuff could probably be fixed in core without any overhead (e.g. events, modifying classes, css stuff)
[12:03:50] <peol> For advanced usage, it would make sense to use a plugin though
