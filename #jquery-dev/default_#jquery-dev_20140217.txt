[11:37:16] <_|Nix|_> Hey! I'm wondering: Would it be possible to add an API function to core that would either expose a regex that allows one to safely pass an ID retrieved from the DOM into a selector? Some use cases: $( theAnchor.attr( "href" ) ) after having established that the href is indeed merely a hash and not something more, or $( "input[type='radio'][form='" + theForm.attr( "id" ) + "']" ) to find radios that belong to a form, but are outside that form.
[11:37:50] <_|Nix|_> ... either expose the regex, or provide a function that will make an ID safe as a parameter to a by-attribute selector.
[11:39:46] <_|Nix|_> We're currently using this bit of modem noise in mobile: .replace( /([!"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~])/g, "\\$1" )
