[04:55:58] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: *sigh* We've been over this :-P
[04:55:59] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/0C0f0P2v0t3O
[04:56:17] <scott_gonzalez> I even put the zip up for donwload at your request: http://temp.nemikor.com/jquery-ui-1.8.20-cdn.zip
[07:18:14] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: I just left a couple comments (and fixed a couple punctuation things) on that blog entry draft.
[09:32:00] <scott_gonzalez> Dear DaveMethvin, Please log in to my machine and run my test case. I cannot provide you with a test case that will fail in your browser.
[09:32:12] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:32:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:32:20] <DaveMethvin> i mean, it COULD be a bug
[09:32:44] <DaveMethvin> but it will be very difficult if we have to run testswarm through this guy's vm for regression tests :D
[09:32:50] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:55:34] <elijahmanor> well i sure do get width: 0 & height: 0 in ie6/7 on browserstack for that guy's code
[09:56:03] <DaveMethvin> good, we'll use your pc for the unit tests!
[09:56:10] <DaveMethvin> i suspect i can repro now that i have his file
[10:12:12] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you know, jQuery's homepage says FF3.6+
[10:12:26] <DaveMethvin> well we have to fix that!
[10:12:47] <DaveMethvin> but it is true we're not supporting it in jquery, right timmywil
[10:12:49] <DaveMethvin> ?
[10:13:25] <DaveMethvin> i believe the "legacy corporate" version of Firefox right now is 10?
[10:13:27] <timmywil> yes, but Sizzle supports it. So it would be great if selector issues could be ported to Sizzle's github.
[10:13:35] <timmywil> when necessary
[10:14:10] <DaveMethvin> i guess what we'll do there is if someone reports against ff3.6 we will just ask them to report in Sizzle
[10:14:24] <timmywil> that works
[10:14:44] <DaveMethvin> really they shouldn't be reporting ff3.6 bugs against jQuery, because even if selectors work many other things may not
[10:15:03] <timmywil> true, but our homepage is no indication that they should ;)
[10:15:11] <timmywil> n't
[10:15:13] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: what is the process for editing the jquery.com page now?
[10:16:51] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I think that's running off of a legacy branch of web-base-template?
[10:17:02] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^
[10:17:17] <gnarf> confirm
[10:17:44] <gnarf> and the legacy branch of jquery.com repo for content
[10:18:03] <gnarf> What needs to change? I already have that repo configured here
[10:18:06] <gnarf> and I can push the change
[10:18:27] <DaveMethvin> we need to say we support Firefox 10+ not Firefox 3.6+ gnarf
[10:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG, Google CDN updated before I finished the release process.
[10:19:52] <scott_gonzalez> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.23/jquery-ui.js
[10:20:35] <gnarf> where do we say that DaveMethvin?
[10:20:55] <DaveMethvin> it's in the hover for the "cross browser"
[10:21:00] <gnarf> gotcha
[10:21:49] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: change deployed
[10:22:04] <DaveMethvin> thanks gnarf!
[10:22:20] <DaveMethvin> now we just need to find the other 215 places on jquery sites where it says that :D
[10:28:51] <sizcommit> [sizzle] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/P8lEkA
[10:28:51] <sizcommit> [sizzle/master] Update README.md: Add browser support link - Timmy Willison
[10:48:13] <gnarf> when did we change then to be pipe?
[10:50:44] <gnarf> cuz that totally just broke code
[10:50:56] <gnarf> https://github.com/maccman/spine/pull/328/files#r1371798
[10:58:54] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: it was on the list and voted for
[10:59:12] * gnarf shrugs
[10:59:13] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[10:59:18] <gnarf> seems like thats gonna break shit
[10:59:40] <gnarf> but oh well
[11:00:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah had I known it wouldn't satisfy Promise/A zealots i think we should have left it alone
[11:00:33] <DaveMethvin> but done/fail keeps the existing promise fine
[11:00:48] <gnarf> what about .always() ?
[11:00:55] <gnarf> i think that was implemented as .then( a, a )
[11:00:58] <DaveMethvin> yes only then changed
[11:01:15] <DaveMethvin> letme check to be sure
[11:01:47] <DaveMethvin> yep always is fine
[11:01:52] <gnarf> okay :)
[11:02:07] <DaveMethvin> the idea was that the "standard" way to detect a Promise/A impl is to look for a "then" method
[11:02:31] <DaveMethvin> so people were doing that and we gave them something that didn't return a new promise
[11:02:41] <DaveMethvin> so that broke interoperability
[11:02:45] <DaveMethvin> but then once we changed it
[11:03:05] <DaveMethvin> people complained we didn't try to fail script errors to the error callback
[11:03:16] <DaveMethvin> which i don't think we can do
[11:03:29] <DaveMethvin> because we don't know what args the error callback expects
[11:05:31] <DaveMethvin> damn scott_gonzalez is already out with .23 and i haven't figured out what we'll break in 1.8.1 yet ... better get moving
[11:05:46] <DaveMethvin> well there's always mobile
[11:05:54] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:07:08] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Will 1.8.x be bug-fix only?
[11:07:18] <DaveMethvin> i sure hope so scott_gonzalez
[11:07:46] <DaveMethvin> vs say, changing the meaning of .then or .width?
[11:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[11:08:07] <DaveMethvin> i would like to think we can stay with what we have
[11:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> I want to get to a point where I can sell my old MBP.
[11:08:19] <DaveMethvin> and just explain the changes in some blog posts
[11:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have any intention of checking out any SVN repos on my new one.
[11:08:25] <DaveMethvin> yay@
[11:08:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah don't pollute the pool
[11:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> So UI 1.8.x releases are still happening on the old one.
[11:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> I honestly don't even know the password for the SVN repo.
[11:09:10] <DaveMethvin> hah
[11:13:33] <elijahmanor> opps, i wasn't logged in when i commented on a bug ;) http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12310
[11:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Did you see Krinkle's comment about the encoding on our CDN?
[11:24:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no
[11:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> http://code.jquery.com/color/jquery.color-git.js
[11:24:27] <scott_gonzalez> search for 4.2.3
[11:31:14] <elijahmanor> now that win8 has RTM'ed is IE10 going to be added to testswarm?
[11:31:22] <elijahmanor> or has it already?
[11:34:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: think i fixed it
[11:35:43] <gnarf> some things may need to be reloaded
[11:35:52] <gnarf> but new content will get served with utf-8
[11:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://code.jquery.com/color/jquery.color-2.0.0.js needs to be reloaded.
[11:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember what Krinkle was looking at when he noticed the problem.
[11:37:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it has been
[11:37:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:38:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: also Krinkle: its http://code.origin.jquery.com/jquery.color-2.0.0.js?reload
[11:38:47] <gnarf> danheberden: are you around?
[11:39:45] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: GMAIL HATES SEARCHING for "1.8.20"> I AM SORRY. D:
[11:39:53] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for getting 1.8.23 up so fast.
[11:40:58] <paul_irish> aye
[11:41:05] <paul_irish> :)
[12:04:56] <danheberden> gnarf, ya
[12:05:46] <gnarf> danheberden: can you get me keys to docs.jquery.com
[12:05:58] <gnarf> ?
[12:06:22] <gnarf> we are referencing some old files we killed in the server migration
[12:06:38] <gnarf> i could dig them back up, but I'd really just like to kill these links
[12:07:44] <danheberden> gnarf: added
[12:07:51] <danheberden> your key to the box for jqadmin
[12:11:38] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin maybe we should store all styles as strings in an object table? We can add the lookup, concatenation, attribute validation and updating to every single API in jQuery. That overhead will likely be trivial.
[12:11:38] <b-ot> rwaldron, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[12:11:45] <rwaldron> b-ot: read
[12:11:46] <b-ot> rwaldron, from ryanneufeld, 22h 23m ago: hey dude, msg me when you have a sec.
[12:12:19] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: it's the least we can do to prevent the slaughter of innocent -moz attributes in Chrome
[12:13:13] <DaveMethvin> first they came for the -moz attributes, and i said nothing....
[12:17:41] <gibson042> way to crush his spirit with your attitude, rwaldron
[12:17:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah, meany!
[12:17:57] <gibson042> or should I say, "rwaldron"
[12:18:35] <DaveMethvin> i was just about ready to get Sarah McLachlan to sing "Arms of an Angel" for a "Save the Attributes" campaign, and you RUINED it
[12:19:29] <DaveMethvin> we never shoudl have exposed things like $.merge and $.unique
[12:39:06] <scott_gonzalez> OMG, I thought jQuery bugs were bad: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=765645#c13
[12:41:04] <gnarf> jesus
[12:42:11] <gibson042> no, even better
[12:42:13] <gibson042> YHWH
[12:43:58] <snover> †
[12:47:07] <sonotos> lol
[12:50:24] <paul_irish> you need to click through to constellation7.org to really take it in
[12:51:49] <gibson042> I can see why YHWH is upset; opacity: 0.7 really ties it all together
[12:54:35] <ajpiano> that thing is so insane that trying to analyse it to say funny thigns about it is almost unnecessary
[12:54:59] <ajpiano> but that said, i like how he's not a professional web developer, which means that therefore he should be reimbursed his hourly rate as CEO for all his webdevelopment work, by mozilla
[12:55:04] <ajpiano> amazebalsl'
[13:01:11] <gnarf> paul_irish: lolz
[13:16:25] <ryanneufeld> Oh man, the alert telling you to zoom out twice LOLZ
[13:16:48] <ryanneufeld> Chrome want's three plugins for this.... !?!
[14:48:20] <shoky> thus spake YHWH
[16:10:31] <mikesherov> remysharp: jsbin renders in quirksmode! http://jsbin.com/otipoq/11/
[16:11:35] <mikesherov> <!doctype html> needs to be the first thing, but jsbin does a <script>setInterval=setTimeout;</script><!DOCTYPE html>
[18:53:36] <elijahmanor> nice catch mikesherov & sweet that remysharp fixed it sooo quickly
