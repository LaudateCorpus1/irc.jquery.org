[08:00:02] <Krinkle> Anyone who's admin on jquery/qunit-composite with an npmjs.org account set up locally?
[08:00:10] <Krinkle> I see I'm the only one with push access to the npm package of it.
[08:00:16] <Krinkle> I'd like to virally share it with one or two people

[08:01:01] <Krinkle> Same for qunit-reporter-junit

[08:02:33] <Krinkle> https://www.npmjs.org/package/qunit-composite
[08:23:40] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: would you be interested in taking these over, moving them to your account?
[08:24:10] <Krinkle> Not really. I never used composite, and for output I use JSON everywhere
[08:24:22] <Krinkle> they used to be in jquery/qunit

[08:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: I haven't looked at composite in a while, but I might be able to take that over.
[11:28:15] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: we're adding integration tests using corpus files to JSCS to verify presets match the given code: https://github.com/mdevils/node-jscs/pull/489/files
[11:28:58] <mikesherov_> is copying jQuery source files for the purpose of testing ok: https://github.com/mrjoelkemp/node-jscs/blob/google_preset/test/data/options/preset/jquery.js do we need to include any licensing info?
[11:29:11] <mikesherov_> or maybe scott_gonzalez ^ you know the answer?
[11:31:38] <scott_gonzalez> You must include the license for any substantial portion of jQuery code.
[11:33:19] <mikesherov_> I suppose the contents of core.js counts as substantial ;-) I'll add the license from the dist file?
[11:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> That works.
[12:49:13] <leobalter> jzaefferer and Krinkle: ping
[12:49:24] <Krinkle> pong
[12:49:55] <leobalter> I really want to remove these tests implemented here: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/1ac4a1219113087f6068ea43c1d5e333cac60009 (in test/tests.js)
[12:50:03] <leobalter> they look unnecessary
[12:50:25] <leobalter> at least they're not nicely implemented 
[12:52:26] <leobalter> even I believe I won't do anything wrong, removing existing tests tells me that I need to discuss this before.
[12:58:58] <leobalter> it's testing only the HTML reporter, and it deletes all the QUnit.done callbacks. I

[13:51:50] <gibson042> timmywil: why did you stray from semver?
[13:52:29] <timmywil> gibson042: see https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/266
[13:53:22] <timmywil> gibson042: or for a summary https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/releases/tag/2.0.0
[13:53:39] <gibson042> ah, interesting
[13:53:45] <gibson042> hooray for us, I guess :)
[13:55:13] <timmywil> gibson042: what's your npm username?
[13:55:31] <gibson042> I think I'm gibson042, but I haven't used it in a long while
[13:56:04] <gibson042> yeah; gibson042
[13:56:13] <DaveMethvin> nice work timmywil, I think your compromise made everyone happy!
[13:56:30] <timmywil> thanks :)

[13:58:24] <timmywil> gibson042, DaveMethvin: you've been added as Sizzle owners
[13:58:32] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[14:10:31] <Krinkle> leobalter: A while back we already discussed the nature of adding tests are the suite has been completed
[14:10:48] <Krinkle> It also affects reporters and aggregators such as grunt and testswarm
[14:10:54] <Krinkle> in that, they won't be seen.
[14:11:07] <Krinkle> I think we all agree it's a useless and annoying feature.
[14:11:19] <Krinkle> possibly implemented by accident and then considered a feature later on
[14:11:27] <Krinkle> I'd say drop it
[14:11:42] <leobalter> nice
[14:12:23] <Krinkle> Both addition of assertions after a test is async/done(), and adding of tests/modules after the suite is done, should result in an error 
[14:12:48] <Krinkle> I guess it was nice during development so you can add thigns one by one from the console
