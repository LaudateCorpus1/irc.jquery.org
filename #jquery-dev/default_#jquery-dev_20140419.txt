[02:15:32] <Hugues_> Hi.
[02:17:53] <Hugues_> I've an issue with Jquery.
[02:19:11] <Hugues_> I try to manage another arg_separator.input than "&" as said here: http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-html401-19991224/appendix/notes.html#h-B.2.2
[02:19:48] <Hugues_> Do you know if there is a way to manage this argument separator in jquery please?
[02:20:10] <Hugues_> Or is it in progress maybe?
[19:08:04] <m_gol> Crap
[19:08:57] <m_gol> DaveMethvin|away: I came here to check if we didn't forget to update Sizzle again as it's just come to my mind...
[19:09:37] <m_gol> DaveMethvin|away gibson042: we can't re-publish on npm, the option was removed
[19:09:45] <m_gol> At best we can unpublish
[19:09:59] <m_gol> But we can't publish another rc1 on npm
[19:10:35] <m_gol> Unless we convince sb from the npm team to make an exception this time.
[19:11:55] <m_gol> DaveMethvin|away: Anyway, if we want to try to move the rc1 tag to another place we should unpublish it asap
[19:12:38] <m_gol> Maybe we can publish sth like 2.1.1-rc1+1 to npm this time
[19:12:49] <m_gol> After unpublishing 2.1.1-rc1
[19:16:37] <m_gol> DaveMethvin|away: I won't have my computer before Monday evening European time, though.
