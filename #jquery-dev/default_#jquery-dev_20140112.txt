[06:55:25] <markelog> ping DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez
[06:55:55] <DaveMethvin> hey MacHawk 
[06:56:00] <DaveMethvin> markelog: duh
[06:56:14] <markelog> MacHawk :-)
[06:56:15] <DaveMethvin> sup?
[06:56:22] <markelog> hey
[06:56:23] <markelog> In our style guide - http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/
[06:56:29] <markelog> there is clause about spaces
[06:56:40] <markelog> but there is no mentions about parentheses for grouping
[06:56:54] <markelog> only implicitly
[06:56:59] <markelog> like â€“
[06:57:05] <markelog> for ( ; (elem = elems[ i ]) != null; i++ ) {
[06:57:10] <markelog> should parentheses around "(elem = elems[ i ])" require extra spaces?
[06:57:15] <DaveMethvin> we used to have that exception abou grouping but i think we dropped it
[06:57:21] <DaveMethvin> so now there are spaces
[06:57:44] <markelog> wow
[06:57:53] <DaveMethvin> i think we are too spacey
[06:58:09] <markelog> how text under "Multi-line Statements" header
[06:58:17] <markelog> / Good
[06:58:17] <markelog> var html = "<p>The sum of " + a + " and " + b + " plus " + c +
[06:58:17] <markelog>     " is " + (a + b + c);
[06:58:40] <DaveMethvin> i like the lack of spacing there
[06:59:03] <markelog> i'm implementing rule for this in jscs
[06:59:07] <DaveMethvin> but i seem to recall dropping it with the thought it would be hard to detect and validate
[06:59:18] <DaveMethvin> can jscs tell the difference?
[06:59:28] <markelog> yeah
[06:59:33] <markelog> but it's hard to implemented
[06:59:44] <DaveMethvin> well see, we made your job easier!
[06:59:45] <DaveMethvin> :)
[07:00:02] <markelog> okay! So there should be spaces then
[07:00:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:25:27] <scott_gonzalez> markelog DaveMethvin: Yes, I think we had full agreement that no spaces for grouping looks nice, but we would defer to spaces if we couldn't automate that check.
