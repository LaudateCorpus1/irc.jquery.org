[07:05:34] <mayerbci> does anybody have issues with page loads on android/chrome? everytime I push new code to my server this browser hangs and eventually loads a page
[07:06:03] <DaveMethvin> mayerbci: #jquery please, if it's a jquery problem
[07:06:20] <mayerbci> will do
[07:19:42] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 m_gol I'm planning on doing the release today ... looks like sizzle needs an update?
[07:20:06] <DaveMethvin> or is that commit not related to a ticket?
[07:21:05] <rwaldron> m_gol ping
[07:28:24] <DaveMethvin> afk for a while
[09:07:38] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: you're good to go with Sizzle 1.10.19; https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/commit/f204a6112216f31685717d9fc1bf6cabf42b2ef1 is intended to reduce size without affecting functionality and is hopefully harmless, but I see no reason to introduce risk right on top of a release
[09:35:48] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: yeah i looked at it and figured that, but given history it doesn't hurt to ask! thanks
[10:09:43] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: present
[10:10:03] <DaveMethvin> hey m_gol, i think i got everything i need
[10:10:10] <DaveMethvin> just about to do the release
[10:10:19] <m_gol> in a Debian VM? ;)
[10:10:23] <DaveMethvin> yep!
[10:10:27] <m_gol> good luck!

[10:14:10] <m_gol> that was quick!
[10:14:10] <DaveMethvin> i like that hash better than my test, which had "bad" in it :)
[10:14:19] <m_gol> :)
[10:15:33] <DaveMethvin> crap, looks like the npm publish command is flaking out again
[10:15:35] <DaveMethvin> i had this problem with the beta too
[10:15:44] <DaveMethvin> but it works fine when i do it manually
[10:16:05] <DaveMethvin> oh there it goes ... just took 45 seconds
[10:16:31] <m_gol> lol
[10:16:33] <DaveMethvin> hey why did it tag that beta?
[10:16:35] <snover> npm publishing is super fun now since they donâ€™t let you unpublish
[10:16:41] <snover> and republish
[10:16:44] <snover> with the same version number
[10:16:52] <snover> so make sure you never get it wrong!
[10:17:04] <DaveMethvin> http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/87e98a.png
[10:17:27] <DaveMethvin> i demand the right to revise history!
[10:17:50] <snover> it works ok for git
[10:17:59] <DaveMethvin> of course, the only thing the dry run doesn't test is the npm publish ... :(
[10:18:13] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: hmm, we could do it
[10:18:19] <m_gol> if we use a fake test package
[10:18:32] <m_gol> not sure if it's worth the effort
[10:18:38] <DaveMethvin> well let me find out why this tagged beta
[10:18:45] <vladikoff> :(
[10:19:44] <DaveMethvin> wat https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/blob/master/lib/npm.js#L42
[10:20:03] <DaveMethvin> were we supposed to override npmTags?
[10:21:09] <DaveMethvin> cause we don't https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/build/release.js#L115
[10:23:21] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, how do i just remove the beta tag there?
[10:25:16] <DaveMethvin> npm docs are sucky
[10:29:33] <DaveMethvin> well screw it, the npm damage is done so i'm pushing to git
[10:30:03] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/568f3dd84693629768b40e7b5cf4c60e0c57c4d4

[10:35:11] <doesallmagic2> Dave Methvin: Build: Updating the master version to 2.1.2-pre.
[10:36:34] <DaveMethvin> well the 1.x branch shouldn't be tagged beta since it overrides npmTags https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.x-master/build/release.js#L116
[10:37:00] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we've done a non-beta release on master before, at least I haven't
[10:38:16] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: when you ran jquery-release did it return to a prompt once it was complete? i haven't gotten to a prompt and the last output was "please review the project-specific checklist"
[10:46:15] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin tagged 061.11.1 at 140d5ec2d: 02http://git.io/7OSfVg
[10:46:15] <jqcommit> 13jquery/061.11.1 140d5ec2d 15Dave Methvin: 1.11.1
[10:48:09] <DaveMethvin> yes, we have definitely never done a real release using jquery-release http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/fc4dcf.png
[10:49:03] <DaveMethvin> so now i need to figure out whether i shoudl let it go ahead, or stop it now and continue the other steps manually
[10:49:10] <DaveMethvin> man i hate when this happens
[11:01:27] <DaveMethvin> whee, more errors http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/785f55.png
[11:06:52] <DaveMethvin> i don't get it, this is like the third time I've had npm publish fail on me and then work fine when i do the command myself http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/3d36ff.png
[11:08:10] <DaveMethvin> now i have to do all the zipping for the cdn's myself, no way i'm retrying this
[11:12:48] <DaveMethvin> oh i think i see what "beta" is supposed to mean now, it's more like a version tag meaning "latest unstable version availble"
[11:13:16] <DaveMethvin> which makes sense, jquery@latest is default and jquery@beta is the most recent dev version
[11:13:42] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: yes
[11:14:03] <m_gol> since 2.1.1 is the latest unstable version as well as the latest stable one, it's ok it's labeled as beta
[11:14:11] <DaveMethvin> so the only mystery is why the npm publish dies so often
[11:14:22] <m_gol> it's because when sb installs jquery@beta, they shouldn't get an older release than the current stable one
[11:14:23] <DaveMethvin> and leaves me to complete the other steps manually
[11:14:26] <DaveMethvin> right
[11:14:41] <m_gol> what was that with the wrong copying to cdnrelease?...
[11:15:08] <DaveMethvin> the 1.x branch needs to overwrite jquery.js and jquery-latest.js and cp said no dice
[11:15:22] <DaveMethvin> i went to another window, copied it, committed, and continued
[11:16:02] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/commits/master
[11:16:30] <m_gol> what is cdn/jquery.js?
[11:17:08] <DaveMethvin> it's this file: http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js
[11:17:14] <m_gol> yeah, but what is this file?
[11:17:20] <m_gol> and how does it relate to jquery-latest?
[11:17:32] <DaveMethvin> it's yet another copy of the latest 1.x
[11:17:38] <m_gol> oh
[11:17:40] <DaveMethvin> history
[11:17:41] <m_gol> why? :D
[11:17:45] <m_gol> lol
[11:18:01] <m_gol> ok, so we need to freeze it as well when we freeze jquery-latest
[11:18:22] <DaveMethvin> well i was expecting to have some place where people could get a copy
[11:18:38] <DaveMethvin> if they're not using Bower or npm
[11:18:53] <DaveMethvin> we talked about having some file on the CDN that was a pointer to the latest
[11:19:13] <m_gol> pointer as in a JSON file with the path to the latest file?
[11:19:19] <DaveMethvin> something like that
[11:19:19] <m_gol> because I'm fine with that
[11:19:31] <DaveMethvin> otherwise there's no easy way to know what the latest version is
[11:19:32] <m_gol> I'm not fine with having a URL that always points to the latest version ;)
[11:19:52] <DaveMethvin> i didn't update -latest this go round, we can do it later
[11:20:30] <m_gol> but such a double-tiered approach (always the same link with JSON -> path to the latest file) seems tedious enough to automate I don't think it'd lead to the same problems as jquery-latest did
[11:20:56] <DaveMethvin> oh man i have to make the zip files manually for 1.x
[11:20:59] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: btw, that means we don't need to fix jquery-release for this copying as we won't do it anymore
[11:21:03] <m_gol> hahaha
[11:21:12] <m_gol> why?
[11:21:35] <DaveMethvin> that step came after npm, which failed and blew out the script
[11:21:50] <DaveMethvin> there's no ability to restart afaik
[11:22:24] <m_gol> ah, right
[11:22:31] <m_gol> npm should be the latest of the latest ones
[11:22:56] <DaveMethvin> after that came building the zip files for google and microsoft cdns, then creating the changelog
[11:23:32] <DaveMethvin> i can do the changelog from the script we have in /build
[11:23:57] <m_gol> it'd be cool if all online operations (exept the initial clone) were done at the end
[11:24:12] <m_gol> with the ability to repeat or skip a step
[11:24:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah there is prob a better way to do this to make it more robust
[11:24:51] <m_gol> we could generate a file with a list of things to do
[11:25:02] <m_gol> in jquery-release
[11:25:21] <m_gol> and then it could pop the first thing from the list, save the file and do it
[11:25:37] <m_gol> if it breaks, we still could do this one step manually and resume from the next item
[11:25:53] <DaveMethvin> you just need to be really careful that a "step" has known effects and can be backed out, but that's where doing all the pushy stuff at the end comes in handy
[11:26:29] <DaveMethvin> ok so i think i have npm right at this point
[11:26:42] <DaveMethvin> and i have the parts i needed from 2.x
[11:26:48] <DaveMethvin> just need to generate the 1.x parts
[13:21:29] <m_gol> DaveMerhvin: ping
[13:21:51] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[13:22:09] <m_gol> it seems the commit to bump version on 1.x-master to 1.11.2-pre wasn't generated
[13:22:34] <DaveMethvin> oh man
[13:22:38] <m_gol> ;)
[13:22:41] <DaveMethvin> did the tag get pushed?
[13:22:44] <m_gol> yes
[13:22:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah i see it above
[13:23:10] <DaveMethvin> i guess it was after the point where it died
[13:23:20] <DaveMethvin> there were several other problems
[13:23:34] <DaveMethvin> the zip files i send to google/ms were empty
[13:23:36] <DaveMethvin> zero bytes
[13:23:38] <m_gol> several?
[13:23:39] <m_gol> oh lol
[13:23:41] <DaveMethvin> so i built those manaully
[13:23:43] <DaveMethvin> manually
[13:23:55] <DaveMethvin> i think i got it all sorted, writing the blog post now
[13:24:03] <DaveMethvin> but not sure what else didn't get pushed
[13:24:04] <m_gol> new jQuery is leanest than ever! 0 bytes!
[13:24:09] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:24:24] <DaveMethvin> 0 bytes ZIPPED
[13:24:35] <DaveMethvin> ok, uh
[13:24:38] <m_gol> try to remember what went wrong, we should get bugs filled for jquery-releaae
[13:24:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:24:44] <m_gol> * jquery-release
[13:24:54] <DaveMethvin> now it's all here in the irc, fortunatley
[13:24:58] <m_gol> :)
[13:25:08] <DaveMethvin> but as far as the bump goes, i am not sure which steps got missed
[13:25:48] <m_gol> fortunately it's easy to recreate this one commit ;)
[13:26:02] <m_gol> although...
[13:26:03] <DaveMethvin> if that's all that broke,  yeah
[13:26:05] <m_gol> on master
[13:26:12] <m_gol> only package.json got the number bumped
[13:26:14] <m_gol> not bower.json
[13:26:33] <m_gol> is it expected?
[13:26:34] <DaveMethvin> i forgot why we have bower.json there anyway
[13:26:40] <m_gol> ;)
[13:26:42] <DaveMethvin> don't we just need it on the tags?
[13:27:00] <DaveMethvin> oh i guess it was so bower users could get edge?
[13:27:05] <m_gol> hmm
[13:27:15] <m_gol> bower doesn't support prepublish scripts
[13:27:16] <DaveMethvin> i think there was some discussion of this
[13:27:21] <m_gol> so I don't know if this matters
[13:27:46] <m_gol> isn't Bower the only reason we have detached tags? npm could probably go just with a prepublish script
[13:27:57] <m_gol> if I understand correctly what it does
[13:28:14] <DaveMethvin> i dunno if we want to publish everything to npm, including unit tests?
[13:28:25] <m_gol> .npmignore takes care of that
[13:28:35] <DaveMethvin> then it may just be bower
[13:28:43] <DaveMethvin> i'd need to defer to timmywil on that
[13:29:00] <m_gol> we only bump versions and add dist/* files in the tags
[13:29:18] <DaveMethvin> but if we don't need bower.json there except for the tags we might as well generate it during release
[13:29:23] <DaveMethvin> and not have to have it clutter the root
[13:29:26] <DaveMethvin> and be out of date :)
[13:29:27] <m_gol> true
[13:29:30] <m_gol> I'm starting to like bower less & less...
[13:29:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:29:36] <m_gol> it's not really reliable
[13:29:45] <m_gol> I mean, we use sth like bowercopy anyway
[13:30:00] <m_gol> one might as well just publish everything to npm & use npmcopy or sth
[13:30:17] <m_gol> at least they have publishing so we'll never need to rewrite 1000 of tags
[13:30:41] <DaveMethvin> i don't think  bower has gotten the kinks out
[13:30:57] <DaveMethvin> and i have to wonder how many of these package managers we need
[13:31:06] <m_gol> yeah
[13:31:38] <m_gol> gotta go for now, congrats on making this stuff work ;)
[13:31:40] <DaveMethvin> i guess the idea was that bower was for client stuff, and npm used by node, php has one, .net has one
[13:31:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah not quite yet
[13:31:51] <DaveMethvin> ok see ya later
