[15:32:27] <forumulator> Hi, devs
[15:32:55] <forumulator> Can someone help me out?
[15:45:34] <robertmaxrees> forumulator do you have a general help question?
[15:46:57] <forumulator> Nope, this is about GSoc. I see that you guys don't have an ideas page up yet. 
[15:47:31] <forumulator> My question is if the unimplemented ideas from the previous year would be carried forward to this year
[15:47:46] <forumulator> Or if you would generate entirely new ideas
