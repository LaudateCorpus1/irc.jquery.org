[03:01:40] <jzaefferer> Krinkle|detached: I think there were plans to extend jscs to fix issues, but I haven't seen anything implemented. esformatter kinda works, but still has plenty issues and isn't moving along

[06:59:27] <markelog> Krinkle: we working on this, first step already there, will merge those soon
[06:59:37] <markelog> Krinkle: you could point here - https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs/issues/516
[06:59:59] <markelog> Krinkle: by my estimation we need a month or so, to do this feature
[07:00:13] <Krinkle> markelog: is someone assigned to it?
[07:00:21] <Krinkle> e.g. it's expected to be usable a month from now
[07:00:49] <markelog> collective effort, basically everyone on the team are involve
[07:01:10] <markelog> Krinkle: first round - https://github.com/jscs-dev/node-jscs/pull/751
[07:01:17] <Krinkle> markelog: And "jQuery Team" generally are on board with using this for our repos?
[07:01:27] <Krinkle> as opposed to esformatter, or js-beautifier
[07:02:30] <markelog> as far as i know those projects are not ready yet, but we're collabrating with Ariya and with those projects too 
[07:20:47] <Krinkle> cool :)
