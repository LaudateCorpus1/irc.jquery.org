[11:34:17] <timmywil> kk
[11:54:10] <rwaldron> timmywil this is killing me
[11:54:23] <rwaldron> ;)
[11:54:31] <timmywil> rwaldron: what's that
[11:54:39] <rwaldron> this failing test
[11:54:49] <rwaldron> I'm removing the IIFEs from the modules so that we're always testing built jQuery
[11:55:06] <rwaldron> no more include_js.php and friends

[11:55:45] <timmywil> yay!
[11:55:55] <rwaldron> yeah, it's good
[11:56:50] <timmywil> and sorry, I'm having trouble with Sizzle.error in IE for some reason and the problem eludes me
[12:00:03] <timmywil> I'll switch to yours

[12:01:20] <rwaldron> forget what I said above
[12:02:03] <rwaldron> timmywil i found it

[12:39:10] <timmywil> rwaldron: so the idea is we build before testing
[12:39:21] <rwaldron> yep
[12:39:26] <rwaldron> just run "grunt watch"
[12:39:29] <rwaldron> timmywil ^
[12:39:37] <rwaldron> and it will "just work"
[12:39:43] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/strip_iife
[12:40:02] <timmywil> nice
[12:40:12] <rwaldron> ?tell DaveMethvin early draft of stripped IIFEs https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/strip_iife
[12:40:12] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
[12:41:03] <rwaldron> ?tell gibson042 Can you make this even smaller? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/strip_iife
[12:41:03] <bot-t> rwaldron, Okay.
[12:41:42] <timmywil> rwaldron: are you busy right now? I think I need a fresh pair of eyes
[12:41:56] <rwaldron> timmywil i can look at stuff
[12:42:53] <timmywil> In IE8, on the "broken" selector tests (meaning invalid selectors), Sizzle.error is throwing a new Error object, but somehow it is not coming through to the test suite.
[12:46:35] <timmywil> these tests only starting failing since I changed things, but for the life of me I can't figure out what's different. There is a different version of QUnit, but I also don't see a problem there.
[12:48:03] <rwaldron> timmywil does this issue occur on sizzle/master?
[12:48:13] <timmywil> it does
[12:48:18] <rwaldron> cool

[13:07:13] <timmywil> rwaldron: any thoughts yet?
[13:08:20] <rwaldron> got side tracked
[13:08:24] <rwaldron> looking at it now though
[13:08:51] <timmywil> cool
[13:12:32] <rwaldron> interesting
[13:12:38] <rwaldron> I'm getting...
[13:13:04] <rwaldron> "object doesn't support this property or method" as the value of the error message property
[13:13:31] <timmywil> me too, but if I alert the error being thrown, the message is correct
[13:13:51] <timmywil> as in, alert in Sizzle, not in the tests
[13:14:27] <timmywil> my guess is maybe it is getting rethrown by QUnit or something, but it's hard to find
[13:14:50] <timmywil> jzaefferer: ping
[13:16:06] <rwaldron> yeah
[13:16:10] <rwaldron> I think this is the case...
[13:16:19] <rwaldron> I just arrived at the same place.
[13:26:02] <rwaldron> timmywil it's not just you
[13:26:08] <rwaldron> I can't figure this out either
[13:26:15] <rwaldron> it's definitely in QUnit
[13:26:30] <timmywil> rwaldron: I feel better then :)
[13:26:35] <rwaldron> I can confirm all the things that you've tried

[15:33:25] <timmywil> alrighty, just the broken error messages and IE6-8 are clean
[15:40:38] <jzaefferer> timmywil: sup? not that I'll be around much longer
[15:40:57] <jzaefferer> also, if there's a QUnit issue, just file an issue over there
[15:41:21] <jzaefferer> even if you aren't sure if QUnit is at fault, maybe QUnit can help in the future to make debugging similar issues easier
[15:42:06] <timmywil> I have one more issue that I can't figure out in the jQuery test suite. Do you know if there's anything changed in QUnit recently that might cause a thrown error to be different than it used to be in IE?
[15:42:40] <timmywil> the error seems to be getting thrown from Sizzle correctly, but e.message isn't what it used to be in the tests.
[15:43:46] <timmywil> actually, the whole error isn't what it used to be. it is changed from an Error to a TypeError somewhere between throwing it and catching it.
[15:45:54] <timmywil> If you don't know of anything, I'm just going to keep investigating.

[16:04:53] <jq-jenkins> timmywillisn: Update Sizzle: Add test for [selected] attribute selections. Addresses a small issue in IE8's boolean attribute selections with QSA.
[16:06:48] <jzaefferer> timmywil: there were changes in QUnit to display stack-lines (where did an assertion fail, where was an error thrown), but generally that's not supported at all in IE, so it shouldn't affect anything
[16:07:16] <jzaefferer> timmywil: though we don't know if its supported until we check for `stack` or similar properties on the exception object
[16:07:23] <jzaefferer> maybe that's whats causing the issue
[16:07:57] <timmywil> jzaefferer: could be, IE Error objects are very sensitive
[16:08:17] <jzaefferer> timmywil: what QUnit version are you at?
[16:08:53] <timmywil> 1.7.0pre
[16:09:07] <jzaefferer> okay
[16:09:11] <jzaefferer> you shouldn't use pre versions
[16:09:24] <jzaefferer> annoying to track down what "version" you're using exactly
[16:09:33] <timmywil> good point
[16:09:36] <jzaefferer> there's tags, latest is 1.6.0
[16:09:41] <jzaefferer> actually v1.6.9
[16:09:43] <jzaefferer> er
[16:09:49] <jzaefferer> v1.6.0
[16:09:58] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/tags
[16:10:02] <timmywil> I didn't notice that, just ran our make update
[16:10:34] <jzaefferer> well, that made sense when there were no tags, which was true for years
[16:11:01] <timmywil> i'll revert back and see if it's still an issue
[16:11:04] <jzaefferer> but changed after Rick and others mentioned the lack of tags at the devday meeting back in October in Boston last year
[16:11:22] <timmywil> yea, I think I may have mentioned it too :)
[16:11:25] <jzaefferer> you can also tell QUnit not to catch errors
[16:11:38] <jzaefferer> or did you do that already?
[16:11:52] <timmywil> yea I did
[16:12:02] <timmywil> but I'd like QUnit to catch errors most of the time
[16:12:08] <jzaefferer> yeah
[16:15:40] <timmywil> jzaefferer: ok same with 1.6.0
[16:15:53] <timmywil> but I'll go ahead and revert to 1.6.0 for core

[18:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: I can't figure it out.
[18:50:16] <scott_gonzalez> It makes it all the way to Sizzle.error() but then a differnet error comes through.
[18:50:19] <scott_gonzalez> It doens't make any sense.
[18:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> AFAICT it's unrelated to QUnit.
[18:53:45] <scott_gonzalez> I get the exact same behavior if I just use try/catch directly instead of raises().

[19:18:59] <rwaldron> why did you change dist to build?
[19:19:02] <rwaldron> that's wrong
[19:19:08] <timmywil> ? I didn't
[19:19:10] <rwaldron> the sizecache file is in dist
[19:19:15] <timmywil> it already was in build
[19:19:20] <rwaldron> no
[19:19:22] <timmywil> I just changed it to what it was
[19:19:27] <rwaldron> we're moving shit out of build
[19:19:38] <rwaldron> we moved sizecache into dist about a month ago
[19:19:53] <rwaldron> hence the new address to ignore in the gitignore
[19:20:17] <timmywil> ok, somebody moved it back then. I don't care where it is, but every time I was doing a make, sizecache was being added to the build directory and was not ignored

[19:20:52] <timmywil> so if you want to change that, that's fine with me
[19:21:00] <rwaldron> yikes
[19:21:03] <rwaldron> make?
[19:21:14] <timmywil> yes
[19:21:18] <rwaldron> you're way behind hombre
[19:21:24] <rwaldron> please dont use make anymore
[19:21:29] <rwaldron> we're replacing the system
[19:21:39] <rwaldron> moving everything to a JS-only system
[19:21:47] <rwaldron> its all in the readme
[19:21:57] <rwaldron> and we've been planning and migrating for months
[19:22:10] <rwaldron> we have a document that should be shared to you as well
[19:22:19] <rwaldron> that outlines all of the project's movement to grunt
[19:22:54] <timmywil> ah, ok
[19:23:28] <rwaldron> ok, you werent shared, sorry
[19:23:36] <rwaldron> I've just sent you a share for the doc
[19:23:41] <rwaldron> sorry for the confusion
[19:23:44] <rwaldron> :\
[19:23:49] <rwaldron> so much to keep track of
[19:23:59] <timmywil> I don't see anything in the readme about grunt
[19:24:13] <rwaldron> and here, I'm thinking "wtf??" meanwhile... you have no idea, which I take the blame for
[19:24:58] <rwaldron> hm. weird
[19:25:02] <rwaldron> i wrote the stuff
[19:25:07] <rwaldron> where is the stuff?
[19:25:22] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[19:25:34] <DaveMethvin> that's why i wrote that ticket about  the readme rwaldron :D
[19:25:42] <rwaldron> ugh FML.
[19:25:44] <DaveMethvin> in the meantime, let me land this commit
[19:25:47] <rwaldron> you're right
[19:25:57] <rwaldron> i never committed the stuff, not pushed the stuff
[19:25:59] <rwaldron> nor*
[19:26:03] <rwaldron> I'm sorry everyone
[19:26:07] <DaveMethvin> just hold on don't push anything
[19:26:07] <rwaldron> my head is clearly up my ass
[19:26:13] <DaveMethvin> i've rebased this commit about 3 times
[19:26:23] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin sure thing
[19:32:43] <DaveMethvin> GAAAH
[19:32:59] <DaveMethvin> i hate merge conflict
[19:33:36] <timmywil> you guys are irritable today
[19:33:43] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:33:54] <DaveMethvin> well i shoulda merged this on thursday
[19:33:55] <timmywil> ;)
[19:34:00] <DaveMethvin> so it's kinda stale now
[19:34:12] <DaveMethvin> and every commit seems to anger the conflict gods
[19:37:09] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vmiFLg
[19:37:09] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix #11767. Modularize build and unit tests for exluding effects. - Richard Gibson
[19:37:14] <DaveMethvin> EAT THAT JENKINS
[19:51:03] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #85: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/85/
[19:51:03] <jq-jenkins> waldron.rick: Adds back dist/.sizecache.json; maintain build/.sizecache.json until build dir is removed
[20:03:42] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin we need to talk
[20:03:51] <rwaldron> I really wish that hadnt landed
[20:04:14] <rwaldron> there was definitely enough discussion asking gibson042 to change the approach
[20:04:36] <rwaldron> I'm very much opposed to exposing defaultDisplay as jQuery.defaultDisplay
[20:05:19] <gibson042> aren't we going to have shared_ by the time 1.8 is released?
[20:05:46] <rwaldron> and now I'm trying to resolve this with the branch https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/strip_iife that was going to fix that problem
[20:05:53] <rwaldron> yeah, I did it today
[20:05:58] <rwaldron> the branch is there
[20:06:03] <rwaldron> you should
[20:06:05] <rwaldron> ack
[20:06:08] <rwaldron> eff
[20:06:39] <rwaldron> but you moved it to css.js
[20:07:16] <gibson042> yeah, we're conflict crazy right now :\
[20:07:27] <rwaldron> the problem is that there are conflicts that AREN'T conflicts
[20:07:38] <rwaldron> not according to git anyway
[20:07:51] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'd like to get you to roll that back
[20:08:07] <DaveMethvin> which one
[20:08:09] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron:
[20:08:16] <rwaldron> the whole thing you just landed
[20:08:25] <rwaldron> it had jQuery.defaultDisplay()
[20:08:37] <gibson042> to be clear: the proper place for that function is in css.js, but we won't need to expose it as long as it's reachable from effects.js
[20:08:38] <DaveMethvin> i thought that was just transitional
[20:08:39] <rwaldron> moved from effects to css
[20:09:03] <DaveMethvin> so we're not planning to ship 1.8 that way
[20:09:09] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin right
[20:09:10] <DaveMethvin> but we have stuff that is  half baked atm
[20:09:18] <DaveMethvin> so that was just for  getting it landed
[20:09:20] <rwaldron> but I pushed the branch today that makes that code unnec
[20:09:38] <DaveMethvin> well let's move forward and not back! :P
[20:09:56] <DaveMethvin> we can land that, and then land the change to remove defaultDisplay()
[20:10:03] <rwaldron> here's how I thought it would play... I thought gibson042 would pull just that part off, making it possible for me to remove the iifes
[20:10:07] <rwaldron> then we would merge
[20:10:18] <DaveMethvin> oh i missed that
[20:10:36] <rwaldron> that way the shared code would be in play
[20:10:47] <rwaldron> and there would be no need for jQuery.defaultDisplay()
[20:11:06] <DaveMethvin> well that's fine, we can remove it rather than back out the whole pull
[20:11:22] <DaveMethvin> where is the branch you mention?
[20:11:47] <rwaldron> hold on, I think I can resolve this
[20:11:51] <rwaldron> give me a min
[20:24:30] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #86: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/86/

[20:33:09] <rwaldron> ok, now I'm good I think
[20:38:38] <gibson042> excellent; I can't wait to revisit https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/668
[20:38:39] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by gibson042 (3m, 4w ago): no ticket: smarter build to avoid redefining common subcomponent-local variables
[20:41:21] <DaveMethvin> looks good rwaldron
[20:45:04] <rwaldron> gibson042 definitely
[20:45:24] <rwaldron> I need to redo my readme stuff, it stinks
[20:45:28] <gibson042> rwaldron: I made some major local changes to grunt-compare-size for arbitrary comparisons. Shall I submit a PR?
[20:45:41] <gibson042> I'm sure there'll be more required for good syntax/style/etc.
[20:45:52] <rwaldron> gibson042 submit to that and I'll pull it in and push it to NPM
[20:46:08] <rwaldron> make sure it's good with jQuery UIs needs as well
[20:46:26] <gibson042> I don't know what those are
[20:46:36] <rwaldron> Oh, just that all of the projects are using it
[20:46:36] <gibson042> but we'll all hash it out on github
[20:46:58] <rwaldron> sounds good
[20:47:02] <rwaldron> ok, i have to go get Rose
[20:47:11] <rwaldron> ttyl
[20:47:14] <rwaldron> have a good night
