[09:31:14] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[09:31:14] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Color build #97: FIXED in 7 min 34 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/97/
[09:31:15] <doesallmagic> mike.sherov: Lock in exact version numbers for NPM
[13:18:14] <ben_alman1> hey scott_gonzalez ajpiano has anyone tried the latest jquery grunt-init template with the plugins site?
[13:26:58] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman ben_alman1: danheberden was working on a plugin, he had probably tried it
[13:28:34] <ben_alman1> thanks DaveMethvin 
[13:28:40] <ben_alman1> i haven't been able to checkb
[13:28:51] <DaveMethvin> btw is it safe to move forward to rc6 now?
[13:28:52] <ben_alman1> but i have to update bbq and hashchange to work without $.browser
[13:29:10] <ben_alman1> rc6 has all grunt-related dependencies locked in without ~
[13:29:18] <DaveMethvin> we seem to be creating work for each other :)
[13:29:22] <ben_alman1> and if there are no show-stopping bugs will be gold
[13:29:28] <DaveMethvin> YAY!
[13:29:37] <ben_alman1> it's rc5 but with the deps locked
[13:29:49] <ben_alman1> when 0.4 comes out officially, they will all go to ~ deps again
[13:30:00] <ben_alman1> but at that point no breaking api changes will be made again until 0.5
[13:30:07] <ben_alman1> so it will be safe
[13:30:26] <ben_alman1> lesson learned
[13:30:30] <DaveMethvin> safe, and effective
[13:30:36] <ben_alman1> yeah
[13:30:43] <ben_alman1> because rc4 -> rc5 saw a major change
[13:31:01] <ben_alman1> but since i had never released it, i wasn't going to burn a whole minor release just to stay in development
[13:31:02] <DaveMethvin> oh i forgot to give you your gold membership card to the Breaking Changes Club
[13:31:13] <ben_alman1> haha well, you ARE the president aren't you
[13:31:21] <ben_alman1> but technically this was pre-release
[13:31:21] <DaveMethvin> you're on the conceirge level
[13:31:23] <ben_alman1> so...
[13:31:43] <DaveMethvin> oh man i know the pain, no problem
[13:31:48] <ben_alman1> heh
[13:32:02] <DaveMethvin> we ship, you ship, we all survive
[13:32:18] <ben_alman1> haha
[13:32:47] <ben_alman1> it's good to know that anything i've fucked up, you've fucked up worse
[13:32:49] <ben_alman1> well until 0.5 i guess
[13:33:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah you are an amateur
[13:33:20] <DaveMethvin> you need more installed base to magnify the pain
[13:40:59] <ben_alman1> back, no idea what i missed
[13:41:10] <ben_alman1> yay ship internet
[13:48:01] <mikesherov> wow, finally fixed all margin-collapse bugs on the ui rewrite
[13:48:05] <mikesherov> effects*
[13:48:09] <mikesherov> oops, wrong channel
[13:48:21] <DaveMethvin> we're still proud of you mikesherov
[13:49:03] <ben_alman1> speak for yourself
[13:49:11] <DaveMethvin> haha
[13:49:43] <ben_alman1> that was the "royal we"
[13:58:03] <mikesherov> DAMN YOU ben_alman 
[13:58:20] <DaveMethvin> oh how many times have i said THAT
[13:58:25] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: want to know something funny
[13:58:53] <DaveMethvin> of course
[13:58:53] <snover> DaveMethvin: what day don’t you work
[13:59:04] <mikesherov> so, if you have a form element
[13:59:09] <mikesherov> and you don't specify a height
[13:59:27] <mikesherov> and then you ask for margin, it's all like "the margin is 2px"
[13:59:30] <mikesherov> which is awesome
[13:59:45] <mikesherov> if you then ask for the height, it's all like "the height is 13px"
[13:59:47] <mikesherov> which is awesome
[14:00:15] <mikesherov> if you then say "style.height is 13px"
[14:00:29] <mikesherov> and then ask for the margin, it's all like "the margin is 0px"
[14:00:44] <mikesherov> and it's not border-box
[14:00:50] <DaveMethvin> vanishing margin ... it's magic
[14:00:51] <mikesherov> or at least doesn't report as such
[14:01:07] <mikesherov> but even if it was border-box, what the hell does that have to do with margins
[14:01:19] <mikesherov> so you have to ask for margin first,
[14:01:23] <mikesherov> then specify margin
[14:01:33] <mikesherov> then ask for height (which was thankfully unchange)
[14:01:37] <mikesherov> then specify height
[14:01:38] <mikesherov> UGH
[14:01:46] <DaveMethvin> so mikesherov is this pretty consistent across browsers?
[14:01:48] <snover> this sounds like an old ie hasLayout question
[14:02:06] <mikesherov> making a test case now
[14:02:15] <mikesherov> but it seemed like it
[14:02:18] <mikesherov> consistent
[14:02:22] <DaveMethvin> snover: to answer  your question, every day is fun day
[14:02:34] <snover> well that answered one question
[14:02:36] <DaveMethvin> although my wife is bugging me to steam clean the shower now
[14:02:42] <snover> you are talking about old ie right now though
[14:02:43] <snover> right?
[14:02:47] <DaveMethvin> die you soap scum
[14:02:53] <snover> very clever dave
[14:03:06] <snover> i dunno why you aren’t an award-winning author with gems like that
[14:03:18] <mikesherov> snover, nope
[14:03:19] <mikesherov> chrome
[14:04:39] <DaveMethvin> hey, i AM an award winning author: http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CMP%27s+WINDOWS+Magazine+Honored+by+the+American+Business+Press-a019213969
[14:05:16] <DaveMethvin> that's the kind of journalism that gets you indicted by the attorney general nowadays
[14:05:38] <snover> you know, i have never been awarded
[14:06:08] <mikesherov> and without normalize
[14:06:18] <DaveMethvin> if you steam clean my shower i will give you my award
[14:06:20] <mikesherov> normalize removed the 2px chrome margins that report weirdly
[14:06:47] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: "normalize"?
[14:07:07] <mikesherov> https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/blob/master/normalize.css#L264
[14:07:16] <DaveMethvin> ah
[14:07:20] <mikesherov> for specifally this reason
[14:07:24] <mikesherov> this BULLSHIT
[14:07:36] <mikesherov> this insane insane BS
[14:07:49] <DaveMethvin> shouldnt' that apply even before you set the height?
[14:07:59] <DaveMethvin> oh nm
[14:08:23] <DaveMethvin> so mikesherov why do you think they call it NORMALIZE?? :D
[14:08:29] <mikesherov> http://jsfiddle.net/JZSMt/
[14:08:37] <mikesherov> feast your eyes on that
[14:09:33] <mikesherov> looks like just a chrome bug
[14:09:41] <DaveMethvin> if jaubourg was here he'd say "sacre bleu!"
[14:09:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah bug them chromies
[14:10:07] <DaveMethvin> boy that is bizaaaaare
[14:11:56] <DaveMethvin> okay, now i really have to clean the shower
[14:12:00] <mikesherov> and take one
