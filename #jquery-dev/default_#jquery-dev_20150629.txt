[06:14:07] <superman10> I am creating an function that contains Ajax, i have a global variable to store the different types of data that can arrive. What would be the best way of passing a global variable as a parameter in the function containing the ajax?
[06:37:06] <arthurvr> superman10: please ask support questions in #jquery. This channel is for development purposes only.
[06:37:46] <superman10> thanks

[08:19:33] <gnarf> m_gol thanks 
[08:19:33] <b-ot> gnarf: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[08:19:34] <gnarf> m_gol I'll try to take a look tonight
[08:19:35] <gnarf> I was so confused
[08:19:36] <gnarf> spent like 2 hrs trying to track it down
[08:19:39] <m_gol> :)
[08:19:43] <m_gol> this was a cool bug
[08:19:58] <m_gol> basically teardown was broken
[08:20:05] <m_gol> so every test run individually succeeded

[08:47:35] <urgrap> johnresig: hello I'm willing to contribute to the jQuery project where can I get started?
[09:24:53] <m_gol> is there anyone with a working content vagrant setup that would be able to help me get it running?
[09:25:35] <m_gol> I was following instructions on freshly cloned repos and they don't work for me
[09:26:46] <arthurvr> m_gol: hey
[09:26:57] <arthurvr> m_gol: where is it going wrong?
[09:27:11] <m_gol> arthurvr: my previous content setup stopped working after a recent pull (I haven't tried it for a long time, though)(
[09:27:17] <m_gol> so I tried to get it running from scratch
[09:27:20] <m_gol> via vagrant
[09:27:24] <m_gol> on freshly cloned repos
[09:27:34] <m_gol> so on jquery-wp-content I just did vagrant up - it worked
[09:28:00] <arthurvr> m_gol: freshly cloned sites or freshly cloned wp-content repo?
[09:28:22] <m_gol> freshly cloned jquery.com, api.jquery.com & jquery-wp-content repos, all of them
[09:28:29] <m_gol> they're in directories side-by-side
[09:29:09] <m_gol> in the jquery.com directory I did `npm install & grunt deploy` - but it fails on wordpress-validate task
[09:30:43] <arthurvr> normally first time you setup and go to vagrant.jquery.com it will ask you to create a new wordpress setup, did you do that?
[09:31:03] <arthurvr> or did it just pick up your previous wordpress install? Iâ€™m not sure myself.
[09:31:28] <arthurvr> m_gol: ^
[09:31:31] <m_gol> it asks me to create a new wordpress setup, do I have to do it
[09:31:32] <m_gol> ?
[09:31:43] <m_gol> I thought it's going to get populated by other repos deploy runs
[09:32:27] <m_gol> when I did the full local setup some time ago, I don't think I did the wordpress install, I just set up a config according to instructions & it worked
[09:32:38] <m_gol> arthurvr: https://gist.github.com/mzgol/fe5b471f85a37b60223e
[09:32:54] <arthurvr> well first time you set the system up you have to setup your new wordpress install with a username/password. Though Iâ€™m unsure if it, after a fresh clone, will pick up you old configs again or not.
[09:33:14] <m_gol> probably not
[09:33:44] <arthurvr> then I think you just gotta go to vagrant.jquery.com (or whatever vagrant.*) and go input a new username/pass again
[09:33:50] <arthurvr> then try the grunt deploy again
[09:33:52] <m_gol> ok, I'll try
[09:33:59] <m_gol> maybe the docs should mention that :)
[09:34:06] <m_gol> I started from https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com README
[09:34:21] <m_gol> it tells to first read the jquery-wp-content one that basically just says "do vagrant up"
[09:34:28] <m_gol> and then to follow http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/#workflow
[09:34:48] <arthurvr> yeah there are some things we can clarify in the docs
[09:35:14] <m_gol> maybe it's logical that if it says "Edit config.json to use the URL, username, and password for your local WordPress network" that one should setup it first manually ;)
[09:35:30] <m_gol> but with the vagrant box doing most of the setup I thought this is handled as well so it's worth clarifying :)
[09:35:38] <arthurvr> yeah sure
[09:35:48] <m_gol> I'll create an issue on contribute for that (after making sure it works with this change ;))
[09:36:02] <m_gol> arthurvr: thx for the help :)
[09:37:47] <m_gol> arthurvr: it works. :) Heh, I feel stupid now. :P
[09:37:57] <arthurvr> Woohooo! :p
[09:42:27] <m_gol> arthurvr: https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/124
[09:59:06] <arthurvr> Thanks m_gol. 
[09:59:17] <arthurvr> Our whole wp-content setup rocks but it confuses all of us once upon a time. I think there are still some team members out there (like DaveMethvin?) whoâ€™ve never been able to set it up.
[10:00:52] <m_gol> well, it's definitely much simpler now with Vagrant than it was before with setting it all manually :)
[10:01:05] <m_gol> at least on UNIX
[10:02:01] <arthurvr> m_gol: never knew the times you had to set it up manually :p
[10:03:22] <m_gol> :)
