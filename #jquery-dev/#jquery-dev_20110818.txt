[07:15:43] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[07:16:33] <jaubourg> so, apparentely I cannot take a microscopic vacation without a big decision being taken at the meeting?
[07:16:52] <gnarf> jaubourg: the one meeting I miss ;)
[07:18:11] <jaubourg> hey timmy :)
[07:21:55] <rwaldron> morning jaubourg gnarf timmywil
[07:21:55] <bot-t> (12 hours 30 mins ago) <ralphholzmann> tell rwaldron check out the boys finished room! http://grabs.ralphholzmann.com/3m.png
[07:22:14] <jaubourg> hey rick
[07:22:15] <gnarf> mornin rwaldron
[07:22:19] <timmywil> jaubourg, rwaldron: mornin!
[07:23:48] <rwaldron> timmywil if you get a chance, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/470 is closable. I had a previous pull request, but the solution was "eh", now updated to combine both his work and mine
[07:23:49] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by moschel (7h, 46m ago): Fix removeData for case when cache is a frame's window
[07:25:07] <timmywil> rwaldron: cool
[07:25:34] <rwaldron> his test was good and approach was sound
[07:25:42] <rwaldron> just not the best execution
[07:25:52] <rwaldron> for a core method
[07:26:23] <rwaldron> so instead of running _every_ removeData call through isWindow as he had, I simple test for !cache.setInterval
[07:26:39] <rwaldron> tests pass across the board
[07:26:55] <rwaldron> theres a link to jsperf if you wanna see numbers
[07:29:46] <timmywil> firefox 3 is so weird
[07:30:11] <timmywil> i'm always seeing opposite numbers for that browser
[07:30:21] <rwaldron> weird === crappy
[07:30:22] <rwaldron> ?
[07:30:52] <timmywil> not necessarily, just unexplainable
[07:31:32] <timmywil> i guess it has more to do with spidermonkey
[07:31:44] <timmywil> jaegermonkey makes much more sense to me
[08:06:24] <jaubourg> rwaldron: http://jsperf.com/iswindow-vs-inline-test/2
[08:07:06] <jaubourg> weird how in is so slow when it shouldn't try and access the value (and should be faster)
[08:07:14] <jaubourg> timmy: any difference in FF3?
[08:09:31] <jaubourg> in a little faster in FF5
[08:11:04] <rwaldron> FF5 is no longer supported
[08:11:15] <rwaldron> by Mozilla, and in short order by jQuery
[08:11:24] <rwaldron> they do push updates now like chrome
[08:11:30] <rwaldron> so now one will be using it.
[08:11:54] <rwaldron> also, "in" is incredibly slow
[08:12:13] <rwaldron> that was half of what i meant
[08:12:16] <rwaldron> sorry...
[08:12:25] <rwaldron> also, "in" is incredibly slow in older IE browsers
[08:12:32] <jaubourg> yeah, but I'm surprised it is
[08:12:40] <rwaldron> i'm not
[08:12:42] <jaubourg> it should be faster than accessing the property
[08:12:50] <jaubourg> "should"
[08:13:51] <rwaldron> http://es5.github.com/#x11.8.7
[08:14:01] <rwaldron> two calls to GetValue
[08:14:09] <rwaldron> http://es5.github.com/#x8.7.1
[08:14:55] <jaubourg> faster in FF6 too
[08:15:48] <rwaldron> before i went with !cache.setInterval, i was testing with the "in" operator
[08:15:57] <jaubourg> weird that they would make in that slow
[08:16:06] <rwaldron> the balance had to be struck between modern and archaic
[08:16:11] <jaubourg> yep, agreed$
[08:16:19] <jaubourg> I was just toying around really
[08:16:26] <rwaldron> word
[08:17:09] <rwaldron> TBH, i was suprised that property access worked in old IEs
[08:17:21] <rwaldron> as smoothly as it did, that is
[08:18:03] <jaubourg> anyway, regarding this test, in is only marginally faster in FF anyway
[08:18:31] <rwaldron> either way, significantly faster then the isWindow call
[08:20:10] <rwaldron> whoa....
[08:20:13] <rwaldron> wtf.
[08:20:21] <jaubourg> wtf what?
[08:20:23] <rwaldron> i just ran the test suite in IE8
[08:20:28] <rwaldron> and saw something I've never seen
[08:20:40] <rwaldron> the suite triggered compatibility mode
[08:20:54] <jaubourg> ><
