[08:01:07] <ben_alman> is there any good way to add a custom property-to-be-animated?
[08:01:35] <ben_alman> so I could do like: $('div').animate({foo: 1}); and have it handle a custom "foo" thing I've defined?
[08:01:46] <ben_alman> or do i have to do it manually using step
[08:01:58] <ben_alman> (i remember talk of an animationHooks way back)
[08:02:03] <ben_alman> gnarf: ping ^
[08:53:05] <gnarf> ben_alman: it uses cssHooks / fx.step.foo
[08:59:09] <ben_alman> oh interesting
[08:59:11] <ben_alman> k
[10:17:25] <kswedberg> ben_alman: check out https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks for some examples
[10:45:25] <ben_alman> hmmn
[10:45:31] <ben_alman> not sure how much it helps me in this example
[10:46:08] <ben_alman> the problem with cssHooks is that they don't seem to provide anything to handle state implicitly
[10:56:42] <gnarf> you could use data inside the csshook
[10:56:48] <ben_alman> yeah
[10:57:07] <ben_alman> so this only makes sense inside of .animate but not really .css
[10:57:18] <ben_alman> well
[10:57:19] <ben_alman> hmmn
[10:57:37] <gnarf> at the current moment, animate relies HEAVILY on .css
[10:57:38] <ben_alman> there's no implicit way to "reset" the state
[10:57:40] <ben_alman> right
[10:58:07] <gnarf> the animateHooks I had were meant to be a prefilter to animate options
[10:58:13] <gnarf> lemme see if i can find the pr
