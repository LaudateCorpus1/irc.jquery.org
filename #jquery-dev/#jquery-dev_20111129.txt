[06:24:49] <rwaldron> .
[06:24:58] <jaubourg> ...
[06:25:03] <rwaldron> hey dude :)
[06:25:06] <jaubourg> hey man
[06:25:08] <jaubourg> sup?
[06:25:11] <rwaldron> not much
[06:25:18] <rwaldron> trying to kick this headcold
[06:25:25] <jaubourg> ouch
[06:25:54] <rwaldron> last night i forked "jquip", created a branch and imported the jQuery test suite
[06:26:00] <jaubourg> soooo... american airlines filling for bankrupcy
[06:26:15] <rwaldron> did a "build all" and tried to test it against the suite...
[06:26:22] <rwaldron> anyone that uses that project is in trouble
[06:26:27] <rwaldron> oh really?
[06:26:28] <rwaldron> good
[06:26:29] <jaubourg> I can imagine that
[06:26:30] <rwaldron> they stink
[06:26:32] <jaubourg> yes, they are
[06:26:40] <rwaldron> i like disruptive airlines
[06:26:42] <rwaldron> jetblue
[06:26:44] <jaubourg> my jqcon slides now have a whole new flavor now
[06:27:04] <rwaldron> they dont have a "first class" section
[06:27:19] <rwaldron> instead, they give everyone  few more inches of leg room
[06:27:21] <rwaldron> and wifi
[06:27:33] <rwaldron> american airlines? not so much...
[06:27:43] <ajpiano> rwaldron: there's wifi on jetblue????
[06:27:51] <jaubourg> that's pretty awesome
[06:27:53] <rwaldron> isnt there?
[06:27:54] <ajpiano> i have never had wifi on it
[06:27:58] <ajpiano> and i fly jetblue all the time
[06:27:59] <ajpiano> nope
[06:28:04] <rwaldron> or am i think of another airline
[06:28:07] <ajpiano> yep
[06:28:12] <rwaldron> sorry, my bad
[06:28:16] <rwaldron> thanks for chiming in
[06:28:26] <rwaldron> well, Virgin is distruptive
[06:28:28] <rwaldron> they have wifi
[06:28:32] <jaubourg> I like the idea of more legroom for everyone
[06:28:36] <rwaldron> and on demand entertainment
[06:28:48] <jaubourg> british airways has on-demand too
[06:28:50] <rwaldron> also, Virgin and Jetblue are always cheaper then American
[06:29:00] <rwaldron> so, again... American Airlines... not so much
[06:29:29] <rwaldron> ajpiano i might've been confusing Jetblue and Virgin
[06:29:37] <ajpiano> yeah
[06:29:39] <ajpiano> virgin has wifi
[06:30:32] <jaubourg> never been on a plane with wifo
[06:30:34] <jaubourg> fi
[06:33:41] <ajpiano> me neither :/
[06:37:12] <rwaldron> boaz got me a t-shirt for hanukkah that says "Unit Tests" (on the front) and "AAAAAAAHHHHH!!!" (on the back)
[06:37:50] <ajpiano> lol
[06:39:26] <ajpiano> bot-t: tell sindresorhus when you encounter a spam ticket, please delete the ticket outright instead of closing it invalid
[06:39:27] <bot-t> ajpiano, Okay.
[06:39:53] <sindresorhus> Will do
[06:39:53] <bot-t> (27 secs ago) <ajpiano> tell sindresorhus when you encounter a spam ticket, please delete the ticket outright instead of closing it invalid
[06:40:00] <ajpiano> also, thanks for helping out!
[06:40:12] <sindresorhus> Sure ;)
[06:41:21] <sindresorhus> ajpiano:  Is it possible to report a user on Trac?
[06:41:35] <ajpiano> i'm not sure, tbh,
[06:41:46] <ajpiano> i don't believe it does much good, they seem to have new accounts every time
[06:41:59] <ajpiano> and the spam volume is relatively low compared to where it was months ago :/
[06:42:12] <sindresorhus> ajpiano:  IP blocking?
[06:43:29] <ajpiano> haven't looked into it, there's a couple antispam solutions in place (akismet, typepad)
[06:45:14] <ajpiano> there's a blacklist thing here, but it seems to filter on actual content rather than user
[07:07:04] <rwaldron> ajpiano not sure if you were formally introduced to sindresorhus - I gave him ticket admin yesterday
[07:07:12] <ajpiano> yeah, i saw the loggz
[07:07:12] <rwaldron> :)
[07:07:14] <rwaldron> word
[07:53:50] <crystal88_> hello
[07:56:07] <crystal88_> my question is far not related to the development of jQuery, but I think it is the best place where I can get answer: so does the jQuery license enable me to distribute a project under BSD license that contains the jQuery source in it's unmodified form?
[08:02:21] <martin-g> crystal88_: it shouldn't be a problem. Use jQuery with its MIT license
[08:05:59] <crystal88_> so is it enough to include the uncompressed jquery-1.7.1.js in my library?
[08:06:16] <crystal88_> it contains the MIT license at the beginning
[08:06:26] <ajpiano> yes
[08:07:01] <crystal88_> ok, thank you very much.
[08:23:19] <Rwhitbeck> Just a heads up http://twitter.com/aarronpainter/status/140883372858810370 there were some missing .1 on the link text for 1.7.1 links on the Download jQuery page.  I went through and fixed it.
[08:23:20] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from aarronpainter: Hey @jquery - you're missing some .1's here : http://t.co/ACaExbZk ★ http://bit.ly/uNeAtp
[08:27:08] <ajpiano> thanks Rwhitbeck
[08:27:48] <Rwhitbeck> ajpiano posted a blog post about the trainings for UK…got a tweet scheduled for early tomorrow morning to be timed for mid morning UK.
[08:31:29] <ajpiano> cool
[08:52:38] <sindresorhus> I tried running the testsuite for the latest git and 1.7.1 in Chrome 15 on a Mac, and I'm getting some failed testcases: https://img.skitch.com/20111129-xaj54nai69p13nhfhh9fux24yk.png
[08:52:39] <sindresorhus> Any thoughts why?
