[18:30:16] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 4 new commits to master: http://git.io/NPuWvQ
[18:30:16] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Update .editorconfig with new properties. Close gh-915. - Sindre Sorhus
[18:30:16] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Remove useless guard for `a`. Close gh-918. - Dave Methvin
[18:30:16] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix #12436, make delegated events fast again. Close gh-923. - Dave Methvin
[18:30:52] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: yeah, triggered focus events don't act anything like real ones :(
[18:31:02] <mikesherov> oh, what a guess
[18:31:10] <mikesherov> Awesome to know
[18:31:17] <mikesherov> I fixed a bug in sizzle!
[18:31:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm impressed
[18:31:27] <mikesherov> I'm generally afraid of that thing
[18:31:38] <mikesherov> only mutants like timmywil and gibson042 dare go there
[18:31:39] <DaveMethvin> haha
[18:31:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah my brain doesn't work like that
[18:31:52] <tbranyen> it sizzles?
[18:31:56] <DaveMethvin> but good on ya!
[18:33:41] <mikesherov> :-)
[18:33:52] <mikesherov> so, I have no unit to prove it, but I know that works
[18:34:30] <mikesherov> oh, you're doing pull requests tonight?
[18:34:35] <DaveMethvin> yep
[18:35:04] <DaveMethvin> at least a few
[18:36:19] <mikesherov> I'd be wary of https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/920 I think it's not fully baked just yet
[18:36:20] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by rvagg (6d, 22h ago): make replaceWith() clone elements where required
[18:36:27] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[18:36:37] <DaveMethvin> i don't think i'll land anything there until 1.9
[18:36:46] <DaveMethvin> i really want 1.8.2 to be the last of that line
[18:36:57] <DaveMethvin> i'd rather leave a rare bug than create a new one
[18:37:17] <mikesherov> yeah
[18:37:38] <mikesherov> I'd also caution against https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/913/files
[18:37:39] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by matjae (1w, 5d ago): Fix #12411 removeClass() doesn't remove as expected
[18:37:54] <mikesherov> that one is ripe for "oh shit, my duck punch stopped working" complaints
[18:38:06] <DaveMethvin> i really wish i could tag these
[18:38:17] <DaveMethvin> it's such a big mess
[18:38:23] <mikesherov> um, can't you create tags?
[18:39:02] <DaveMethvin> not unless we turn on the issues
[18:39:09] <DaveMethvin> they're related i guess
[18:39:17] <DaveMethvin> since they use the same number space
[18:40:59] <mikesherov> well, that's silly
[18:43:31] <mikesherov> I suppose you can edit the titles?
[18:43:48] <mikesherov> and put the version you're considering them for in the front of the titles
[18:43:54] <mikesherov> like a poor mans tagging system
[18:43:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah i can do that

[18:48:19] <DaveMethvin> MAN that is annoying
[18:50:01] <mikesherov> so, how did we make chrome hang THIS time?
[18:53:13] <mikesherov> this must land for 1.8.2: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/922
[18:53:13] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by gibson042 (4d, 7h ago): 12447
[18:53:21] <mikesherov> infinite loop
[18:54:00] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/908/ can land with no problem
[18:54:01] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by staabm (2w, 2d ago): sanitzed data from POST. fixes #12254.
[18:54:07] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: agreed on 922
[18:54:26] <DaveMethvin> just gazing at it and thinking it looks kind of fragile
[18:54:33] <mikesherov> in fact, I'm nervous that 922 doesn't go far enough
[18:54:52] <mikesherov> I think we just put in a stop at like 5 iterations
[18:55:08] <mikesherov> we should*
[18:57:08] <mikesherov> OK, I gotta run. When were you planning on getting 1.8.2 out?
[18:57:24] <mikesherov> I have a few smaller bugs (as usual) I want to knock out before it goes out
[18:58:30] <DaveMethvin> a few weeks mikesherov
[18:58:34] <mikesherov> OK, cool
[18:58:41] <mikesherov> g'night
[18:58:45] <DaveMethvin> gnight!
