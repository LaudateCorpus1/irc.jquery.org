[02:07:35] <trumpete> Hi all. My element events seem to stop firing after I append() the element for the second time. Just wondering if this is expected behaviour? Demo here: http://jsfiddle.net/W8j9x/
[02:43:00] <aaronmcadam> trumpete: wrong channel, #jquery
[02:43:48] <aaronmcadam> trumpete: you probably want $.delegate anyway
[02:48:42] <trumpete> thanks, sorry about the spam

[11:49:33] <jaubourg> and hi there too
[11:55:51] <rwaldron> i hate being home sick
[11:55:52] <bot-t> (5 hours 24 mins ago) <miketaylr> tell rwaldron ping me when you're free to chat about ISO 6391 stuff
[11:55:52] <bot-t> (5 hours 22 mins ago) <miketaylr> tell rwaldron we can also talk about ISO 639:1988, http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=12724
[11:56:34] <rwaldron> miketaylr yt?
[11:57:16] <miketaylr> hey rwaldron
[11:57:22] <rwaldron> yo
[11:57:31] <miketaylr> i went to comment on that ticket... but got a 404
[11:57:47] <miketaylr> oh it's working now
[11:57:50] <miketaylr> let me comment there
[11:58:15] <rwaldron> well, talk to me for a second
[11:58:41] <miketaylr> cool
[11:58:43] <rwaldron> (btw, lighthouse has been effed all day)
[11:58:56] <rwaldron> basically, that format was how it was requested to me
[11:59:08] <rwaldron> "en-US"
[11:59:09] <miketaylr> basically... ola thinks that's going to fail
[11:59:20] <rwaldron> that's vague
[11:59:25] <miketaylr> yeah sorry, one sec
[11:59:44] <miketaylr> here's a screenshot he took, http://people.opera.com/olak/navlang.png
[11:59:56] <miketaylr> when you set locale to Norway
[12:00:20] <miketaylr> also IE10 only returns two-letter codes... (i know you probably don't support IE10 yet, etc.)
[12:00:31] <miketaylr> (that screenshot is in XP... no idea if you have OS-level support)
[12:00:37] <rwaldron> we're not worried about ie10 atm
[12:00:49] <rwaldron> weird
[12:00:50] <miketaylr> sure, but you'll get a bug once you are
[12:01:06] <rwaldron> that stuff has all been tested
[12:01:07] <miketaylr> can i forward you his responses, or do you prefer them in the ticket?
[12:01:40] <rwaldron> drop it into the ticket
[12:01:47] <miketaylr> as far as i understood the ISO, a two letter code is still valid
[12:01:59] <miketaylr> s/ISO/standard/
[12:02:26] <miketaylr> so short answer, no way to get en-US from opera right now. long answer, that might also fail in other browsers for different locales
[12:03:18] <rwaldron> goddamnit
[12:03:48] <miketaylr> well it does fail in XP anyways
[12:04:00] <miketaylr> i don't have windows to check win7 or whatever
[12:04:41] <rwaldron> blech
[12:04:47] <miketaylr> yep
[12:04:54] <rwaldron> this is a failure of our testing capabilities
[12:05:30] <miketaylr> wtf, i can't log in
[12:05:38] <miketaylr> "It looks like you've stumbled on an error. We've been notified of the problem."
[12:05:41] <miketaylr> i'll do it tomorrow
[12:05:52] <jaubourg> hey rick
[12:07:52] <rwaldron> miketaylr that's been happening all day
