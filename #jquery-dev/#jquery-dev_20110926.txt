[06:16:30] <jaubourg> fuuuuuu
[06:16:31] <bot-t> (17 hours 50 mins ago) <tbranyen> tell jaubourg question for you about ajaxTransport when you come back
[06:16:57] <jaubourg> tbranyen: if you're around, so am I
[06:32:09] <tbranyen> jaubourg: oh i got it figured out.  was trying to determine the best way to "fall back" to a different transport
[06:32:17] <tbranyen> so instead of triggering a 404 in mine, fall back to the normal ajax
[06:32:28] <tbranyen> and i realized your brillance shown by just not returning an object :-p
[06:41:32] <jaubourg> hehe
[06:42:11] <jaubourg> yeah, transport selection is a "I'll give you something if I can, ask someone else if I can't" thingy
[06:43:00] <tbranyen> yeah i wasn't sure if i was going to have to make a custom dataType
[06:43:03] <tbranyen> this works really well right now tho
[06:43:26] <tbranyen> https://github.com/tbranyen/vertebrae/blob/master/lib/plugins/jquery.js
[06:56:47] <gnarf> mornin
[06:57:44] <gnarf> meeting today?
[06:58:21] <timmywil> yup
[06:59:11] <jaubourg> guess who won't be able to attend?
[06:59:16] * jaubourg spanks himself
[06:59:26] <timmywil> the belgian
[06:59:35] <jaubourg> \o/
[07:11:23] <danheberden> jaubourg when are you flying out?
[07:11:46] <jaubourg> to or from boston?
[07:11:56] <danheberden> when do you arrive in boston
[07:12:06] <jaubourg> friday in the afternoon
[07:12:09] <gnarf> hrm
[07:12:12] <jaubourg> iirc
[07:12:15] <gnarf> this unit failure is bugging me
[07:12:43] <jaubourg> gnarf: the IE7 needing a closure one?
[07:12:49] <gnarf> i'm getting timers still running / leaking in cache after trying http://jqbug.com/p513
[07:12:58] <jaubourg> oh
[07:13:08] <gnarf> and i can't figure out what anything I did would have to do with that
[07:13:39] <jaubourg> you're just running effects tests?
[07:14:22] <gnarf> effects tests are the only ones failing
[07:14:28] <gnarf> but if i ?filter=effects
[07:14:30] <gnarf> they all pass
[07:14:33] <gnarf> if I don't
[07:14:35] <gnarf> ....
[07:14:58] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: all browsers?
[07:15:11] <gnarf> chrome atm
[07:15:26] <DaveMethvin> i had a few probs unless I ran incognito
[07:15:37] <DaveMethvin> some of my plugins screw up the dom i guess
[07:16:13] <gnarf> i've seen those failures
[07:16:20] <gnarf> i don't think this is the same
[07:16:35] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/2f3W3y103f2j1i2q1J2v
[07:17:00] <DaveMethvin> I think it's because you declared `parts` in a var statement. :P
[07:17:26] <gnarf> heh
[07:17:41] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if some other test is leaving crap behind?
[07:17:52] <DaveMethvin> i just almost did that with some propHooks tests
[07:19:03] <gnarf> Yeah, my new tests seem okay
[07:19:35] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, is it possible this is due to the qunit update?
[07:19:48] <gnarf> um, maybe
[07:19:54] <DaveMethvin> it's caused several issues
[07:20:05] <gnarf> but that doesn't explain why it passes in the branch without my changes
[07:23:05] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, the first test fail is the test above "animate with per-property easing", right?
[07:23:12] <DaveMethvin> since it must leave timers running
[07:23:41] <gnarf> i would think that the error would be on the test thats failing
[07:23:49] <gnarf> since its in the teardown that the check is done
[07:24:28] <gnarf> wtf.... they didn't fail this time
[07:25:30] <DaveMethvin> well, that's convenient
[07:26:52] <DaveMethvin> btw gnarf which version of chrome?
[07:26:57] <gnarf> dev
[07:27:01] <gnarf> but same fails in ff
[07:27:06] <DaveMethvin> oh ok
[07:27:13] <DaveMethvin> strange
[07:27:17] <gnarf> yeah
[07:27:24] <DaveMethvin> and it went away on a fresh run of the full unit tests?
[07:27:27] <gnarf> i mean i didn't mess with anything that should mess with that
[07:27:42] <DaveMethvin> did you take the window out of focus?
[07:27:42] <gnarf> it seems to fail about 80% of the time
[07:27:51] <DaveMethvin> or are you leaving it up on screen?
[07:28:34] <DaveMethvin> just wondering if it has something to do with the way timers are treated in background
[07:28:56] <gnarf> maybe?
[07:29:02] <gnarf> hrm
[07:29:09] <DaveMethvin> was that a FIRM maybe? :P
[07:29:11] <gnarf> okay
[07:29:23] <gnarf> that just like crept in on me
[07:29:27] <gnarf> i've seen the focus selector
[07:29:29] <gnarf> so
[07:29:34] <gnarf> now there is another one failing
[07:29:36] <gnarf> offset: scroll
[07:29:53] <jaubourg> guys, sometimes it's near stand-up comedy when you chit-chat about where a bug can possibly come from :)
[07:30:23] <jaubourg> can't help but smile while being completely un-helpful
[07:30:53] <gnarf> no fails if i kept the window focused other than this offset thing
[07:31:25] <DaveMethvin> ah, and ff/chrome are the only two that mess with timers
[07:31:26] <jaubourg> gnarf: have you tried to setTimeout( start, 0 )? SetTimeout( __, 0 ) is my all-healing patch
[07:31:49] <jaubourg> attack of the timers
[07:31:54] <DaveMethvin> or the ever-popular .then( start, start ) // start damn you
[07:32:00] <jaubourg> hehe
[07:32:05] <DaveMethvin> i gotta tellya, i don't get no respect. just yesterday i set a timer for 100ms and it didn't fire until 1 second later
[07:32:07] <timmywil> i still don't understand that
[07:32:51] <jaubourg> I could also switch to always( start ), silly me, dunno why I left this "then" it's sooo 1.5
[07:33:15] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, gnarf, does that mean we'll leak timers when someone has a tab not visible? that sounds bad
[07:33:17] <jaubourg> timmywil: the need for a closure? No idea... I guess start is now using this?
[07:33:25] <timmywil> it's not tho
[07:33:32] <jaubourg> Dave: we won't leak them... they'll just stay longer
[07:33:46] <timmywil> hence my confusion
[07:33:48] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[07:34:10] <jaubourg> at the very least ff and chrome should honor setTimeout( _, 0 )
[07:34:26] <DaveMethvin> setImmediate
[07:34:31] <jaubourg> at least until we have this setImmediate
[07:34:33] <jaubourg> heh
[07:34:37] <gnarf> I still think we should wrap that
[07:34:49] <gnarf> cuz we seem to use setTimeout 0 a bit
[07:34:57] <jaubourg> we should, so that we can provide an imp with setImmediate
[07:34:59] <jaubourg> $.later
[07:35:21] <DaveMethvin> can we just shim window.setImmediate?
[07:35:31] <timmywil> yum
[07:36:29] <DaveMethvin> so how is everyone's stuff doing for 1.7?
[07:37:03] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron and i have been trying to get the propHooks stuff finished, but i'm stuck trying to figure out why the unit test won't work in IE9
[07:37:06] <gnarf> aside from these tests failing
[07:37:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah my prob is unit tests too
[07:37:23] <DaveMethvin> i say we skip them :P
[07:37:28] <gnarf> I should be done with my blockers
[07:38:03] <timmywil> I'll work on getText tonight.  didn't have time over the weekend
[07:38:15] <jaubourg> Dave: I still need a review... I have to make my prez and need to know if I can count on the terms I use in the code :P
[07:38:25] <DaveMethvin> for callbacks?
[07:38:28] <jaubourg> yep
[07:38:41] <DaveMethvin> k, i'll look at that by tonight
[07:38:43] <jaubourg> method names, flag names, etc
[07:38:49] <gnarf> hrm
[07:38:55] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: now this time they failed again
[07:38:58] <gnarf> with the window active
[07:39:03] <gnarf> ....
[07:39:07] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: word on hotel?
[07:39:17] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah looks like they are booked
[07:39:23] <DaveMethvin> for sunday
[07:39:26] <timmywil> mmmmm
[07:39:32] <DaveMethvin> but most likely we can find something
[07:39:51] <jaubourg> http://joseoncode.com/2011/09/26/a-walkthrough-jquery-deferred-and-promise/ <= particularly like the explanation of pipe and the recursive use of it
[07:39:53] <DaveMethvin> we can work it out there
[07:40:16] <timmywil> yea, or i'll be on the street
[07:40:26] <DaveMethvin> oh jaubourg btw the Windows 8 html-js stuff is using promises all over the place
[07:40:35] <jaubourg> :)
[07:40:42] <DaveMethvin> don't worry timmywil we'll find you a place
[07:40:45] <jaubourg> coolness
[07:41:00] <jaubourg> yeah, I heard John's porch is quite nice
[07:41:02] * jaubourg hides
[07:41:30] <jaubourg> Dave: any API doc anywhere?
[07:42:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah lemme get you a link
[07:42:16] <timmywil> jaubourg: better than my porch
[07:42:28] <timmywil> im sure
[07:42:53] <jaubourg> wish I had one myself... "come and squat my porch" sounds sooo cool ;P
[07:43:03] <timmywil> lol
[07:43:21] <jaubourg> man, I so can't wait to be there already... except I need to do my prezo like yesterday :/
[07:43:43] <jaubourg> I'm wondering if I shouldn't talk about pipe a bit for people behind on deferreds
[07:44:04] <timmywil> yea, i still need to update my pres
[07:44:10] <DaveMethvin> http://gist.github.com/1242388
[07:44:27] <DaveMethvin> check out those crazy namespaces
[07:44:46] <DaveMethvin> and yeah jaubourg i think you should mention pipe
[07:44:51] <DaveMethvin> b/c they are crazy useful
[07:45:19] <gnarf> I hope my presentation isn't too dry/useless ;)
[07:45:41] <DaveMethvin> the windows 8 promise impl doesnt' have a pipe-ish thing
[07:45:59] <jaubourg> Dave: oh man, will I get sued if I say the namespacing is of a java-like epic proportion?
[07:46:23] <jaubourg> Dave: they're probably Promise/A compliant and have then handle that
[07:46:42] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: oh yeah i totally agree, they took their .net-ish namespacing and pushed it into javascript
[07:47:25] <jaubourg> in Promise/A, then === pipe, except it's not quite clear from the spec what happens if you return nothing, which is solved with pipe (you use pipe, whatever you return -- even nothing -- is the filtered value)
[07:48:02] <gnarf> so, the fact that this doesn't fail reliably is really f'n annoying
[07:48:16] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: yeah, this is like when you have zoom set
[07:48:24] <DaveMethvin> things just fail and it doesn't make sense
[07:48:37] <gnarf> lol i got caught by that one recently too
[07:49:12] <DaveMethvin> i get caught by it about once a month, just often enough to forget and it takes me about five minutes of saying , "damn this looks familiar"
[07:49:50] <DaveMethvin> but it's really annoying that you have to leave the window in focus and visible else it will misbehave
[07:49:55] <gnarf> yeah
[07:50:04] <gnarf> especially when it gets worse
[07:50:17] <DaveMethvin> i suppose we could start using the page visiblity api and/or focus detection
[07:50:44] <DaveMethvin> might be something to think about for the animation rewrite as wll
[07:51:24] <jaubourg> wheeeeeeeeee animation rewrite
[07:51:31] <jaubourg> DO WANT
[07:51:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:52:04] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: here are the windows 8 samples, atm most of them include the javascript api wrappers in their zip files
[07:52:07] <DaveMethvin> http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/windowsapps/
[07:52:24] <gnarf> okay, this time through - it got caught up in the test
[07:53:10] <jaubourg> I would love it if nodejs would embrace promises
[07:53:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's the perfect application
[07:53:23] <jaubourg> that would make working with its API so much easier
[07:53:26] <gnarf> OMG
[07:53:29] <gnarf> this time it passed
[07:53:32] <gnarf> i changed NOTHING
[07:53:42] <DaveMethvin> but gnarf did you keep it in focus this time?
[07:54:06] <jaubourg> gnarf: yes you did, you need to type in the chat and talk to us... then everything works \o/
[07:54:13] <DaveMethvin> maybe our unit tests just crave attention, yeah
[07:54:27] <gnarf> okay
[07:54:33] <gnarf> sorry for the delayed response
[07:54:37] <gnarf> i was re-running the unit
[07:54:40] <gnarf> this time its failing
[07:54:49] <jaubourg> Dave: are you implying our unit tests are attention whores?
[07:55:05] <gnarf> and all 3 times i kept the window front and focused
[07:55:19] <DaveMethvin> well they certainly are demanding a lot of attention from gnarf and me
[07:55:35] <jaubourg> damn, just got an image of blond chicks chewing bubble-gum with t-shirts saying "unit test this"
[07:55:38] <DaveMethvin> of course mine is an ie issue so that's par for the course
[07:55:51] <DaveMethvin> easy there big fella
[07:55:56] <jaubourg> hehe
[07:56:16] <DaveMethvin> so gnarf you're saying that the three tests gave different results? please say that you're not saying that :/
[07:56:36] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i just ran the test suite, 3 times, hitting refresh - waiting
[07:56:39] <gnarf> fail - pass - fail
[07:56:44] <DaveMethvin> take #2
[07:56:51] <jaubourg> :|
[07:57:05] <gnarf> i'll screenshare this shit just to have someone else to freak out about it with me
[07:57:06] <gnarf> lol
[07:57:22] <DaveMethvin> so is everything ok without this patch?
[07:59:30] <gnarf> no...
[07:59:53] <gnarf> i just checkout'ed master
[08:00:26] <gnarf> lemme pull to newest
[08:00:29] <gnarf> make sure i'm there
[08:01:21] <DaveMethvin> ok well at least you know this patch didn't cause it ... but we don't know what did, ugh
[08:01:36] <gnarf> actually
[08:01:40] <gnarf> i think i tracked it down
[08:01:49] <gnarf> somehow i managed to have a master that was ahead of upstream
[08:02:04] <gnarf> now to rebase this pull
[08:02:05] <DaveMethvin> pull -f that sucker
[08:02:25] <gnarf> hrm
[08:04:50] <gnarf> damnit!
[08:04:52] <gnarf> okay
[08:04:58] <gnarf> i know i'm on clean master now
[08:05:06] <gnarf> and if i run the test once - pass
[08:05:10] <gnarf> refresh - run again - fail
[08:05:33] <DaveMethvin> and the same tests are failing?
[08:05:51] <gnarf> yup
[08:06:02] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/322a0q1U0m06131I0627
[08:06:27] <gnarf> okay
[08:06:31] <gnarf> noone else is getting these right?
[08:06:48] <gnarf> i just got it on chrome stable
[08:06:49] <gnarf> too
[08:06:58] <DaveMethvin> lemme see how chrome 13 fares
[08:09:43] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, i am getting them too
[08:10:06] <DaveMethvin> ran incognito to be sure there was no interference
[08:10:16] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/2l3u273b0n0C082L1f23
[08:10:23] <gnarf> im seeing this one occasionally too
[08:11:20] <gnarf> alright
[08:11:27] <gnarf> i guess i'm debugging these tests for real now
[08:13:08] <gnarf> time to try bisect :)
[08:13:56] <jaubourg> I *did* mention I won't be at the meeting, yes?
[08:14:23] <timmywil> jaubourg: you always miss the meeting
[08:14:30] <jaubourg> yeah, it's weird
[08:14:39] <jaubourg> worked like a charm for me before summer
[08:14:48] <jaubourg> since then, I always end up with something at that very spot
[08:15:03] <jaubourg> always something different too
[08:15:13] <jaubourg> :/
[08:16:07] <gnarf> wtf
[08:16:25] <gnarf> git checkout 1.6.4 ; git submodule update ; make --- run tests --- its locking up....
[08:16:44] <jaubourg> like just hanging?
[08:16:49] <DaveMethvin> ok, now i'm REALLY starting to suspect qunit
[08:16:53] <gnarf> stalling on Running manipulation: append the same fragment with events (Bug #6997, 5566)
[08:17:02] <timmywil> that's expected
[08:17:14] <gnarf> stalling on 1.6.4 is expected?
[08:17:20] <timmywil> with the new qunit yes
[08:17:22] <DaveMethvin> with the new qunit
[08:17:38] <gnarf> i should be on the qunit that was with 1.6.4 right?
[08:17:48] <timmywil> it won't downgrade unless you force a reset
[08:18:00] <gnarf> git submodule update checks it out
[08:18:10] <gnarf> git status doesn't show (new commits)
[08:18:23] <gnarf> so i am assuming I'm on the version of qunit that was tagged with 1.6.4
[08:19:17] <timmywil> ah yes, you didn't do make
[08:19:24] <timmywil> well then
[08:19:33] <gnarf> i did make, just after git submodule update
[08:20:00] <timmywil> hmm, ok, i did the same and mine doesn't hang
[08:20:12] <gnarf> wtfbbq
[08:20:31] <timmywil> i also have cache disabled
[08:20:32] * gnarf clones fresh
[08:20:59] <jaubourg> fresh is a nice project name
[08:21:00] * jaubourg hides
[08:22:30] <timmywil> mchammer fresh
[08:22:44] <jaubourg> yaw dawg
[08:23:21] <gnarf> okay
[08:23:36] <gnarf> whatever was happening there isn't happening on a fresh clone...
[08:25:03] <timmywil> i am getting effects and offset fails on the current master with the new qunit
[08:25:12] <timmywil> seems they all have to do with timers
[08:25:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah, seeing them as well with chrome 13 and firefox 6
[08:27:25] <timmywil> running current master with old qunit
[08:27:54] <timmywil> and it seems everything passes
[08:28:32] <timmywil> so i vote we revert qunit and let jörn deal with adding those extra timers
[08:28:58] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, gnarf: what say you
[08:29:14] <gnarf> i say let me dig a second and see if i can't find why
[08:30:17] <DaveMethvin> and if  you can't find out i agree, let's revert ... there's another pull from AaronAsAChimp that exhibits fails with the latest qunit too
[08:34:07] <jaubourg> +1 on reverting
[08:34:13] <timmywil> i might have a fix
[08:34:34] <jaubourg> anyway, I gotta fly
[08:34:43] <timmywil> cyl jaubourg
[08:34:44] <jaubourg> have a nice meeting guys
[08:34:51] <jaubourg> bbl :)
[08:37:51] <gnarf> so - it seems qunit 7f292170fa1109f1355f3e96f8973c32fc553946 is solid
[08:38:00] <gnarf> timmywil: what qunit sha were you using?
[08:38:50] <timmywil> the 1.6.4 one
[08:38:55] <timmywil> that one
[08:45:19] <gnarf> 61137fd6d1813b5f9ab2dfe7e4749ef1d51115d9 is the first bad commit
[08:45:19] <timmywil> yea nvm, i don't have a fix
[08:45:37] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/61137fd6d1813b5f9ab2dfe7e4749ef1d51115d9
[08:45:38] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on qunit by wwalser (1w, 1d ago): added parameter to start and stop allowing a user to increment/decrement the semaphore more than once per call
[08:45:46] <timmywil> i figured
[08:46:09] <timmywil> it changed the api for stop
[08:46:26] <DaveMethvin> yeah and they say WE don't respect the API :P
[08:46:38] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: well, we fixed that
[08:46:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[08:46:54] <timmywil> more importantly, the change adds timers so that our timer check fails
[08:47:04] <timmywil> i don't know what the timers are for
[08:47:25] <timmywil> or how exactly they are getting added and they weren't before
[08:47:33] <gnarf> i think its to allow you to stop( 1000 );
[08:47:44] <gnarf> saying if it doesn't finish in 1000ms consider it failed
[08:47:45] <timmywil> gnarf: that's what it used to do
[08:48:12] <gnarf> but they changed it
[08:48:13] <gnarf> ?
[08:48:13] <timmywil> now it sets a timeout based on the config a certain number of times based on that "semaphore"
[08:48:25] <timmywil> which means we may have stray timers
[08:48:46] <timmywil> so stop(1000) would set 1000 timers
[08:50:35] <aaronmcadam> is it an api decision to not allow the settings of { buttons : null } in a jquery ui dialog?
[08:51:25] <DaveMethvin> aaronmcadam: best to ask in #jquery
[08:51:30] <aaronmcadam> i have done
[08:51:37] <aaronmcadam> I was just wondering, the api is confusing

[08:52:27] <gnarf> i'm not sure, and kinda in the middle of something
[08:52:34] <aaronmcadam> no prob
[08:54:33] <gnarf> so i guess timmywil that my pull is okay then
[08:54:43] <gnarf> it seems to pass with the parent to that commit
[08:59:11] <timmywil> ok, i'll roll out a revert
[08:59:43] <timmywil> has something to do with the start/stop calls, but I don't think we're using them incorrectly
[08:59:57] <timmywil> and we're never using arguments
[09:01:42] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/S1Avrg
[09:01:42] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Revert QUnit. Recent start/stop changes cause problems with some start/stop calls in effects and offset. Run git submodule update - timmywil
[09:04:28] <timmywil> ?tell jzaefferer http://git.io/S1Avrg  We reverted QUnit.
[09:04:30] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[09:09:38] <kborchers> poor jzaefferer, first he's not wearing his own underwear, now this ;)
[09:12:51] <rwaldron> wait
[09:12:53] <rwaldron> wtf?
[09:13:05] <rwaldron> i thought stop() already expected an arg
[09:13:07] <rwaldron> for timeout?
[09:13:13] <rwaldron> (or is that the issue)
[09:13:30] <rwaldron> sorry, was working on a popcorn.js bug
[09:28:36] <timmywil> rwaldron: they changed what the argument is, but that wasn't really the problem
[09:28:55] <timmywil> in making that change, they created an issue for us with their semaphore
[09:29:02] <timmywil> i don't really understand it all
[09:29:57] <rwaldron> yeah... that sucks
[09:30:12] <rwaldron> i have a ticket for popcorn.js to upgrade qunit
[09:30:28] <rwaldron> we use the timeout arg
[09:30:33] * rwaldron shrugs
[09:33:39] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[09:34:50] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin hey dude
[09:35:15] <DaveMethvin> oh man, i just cannot get this unit test to work on ie9
[09:35:31] <DaveMethvin> this fiddle works: http://jsfiddle.net/PECfF/
[09:36:44] <DaveMethvin> this unit test does not: https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/blob/fix-8789-rwldrn-fix/test/unit/event.js#L2403
[09:36:48] <DaveMethvin> the events don't fire
[09:37:15] <DaveMethvin> works fine in chrome and firefox natch
[09:37:58] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: what are you trying to do?
[09:38:10] <DaveMethvin> fire a focus event using the native dom focus method
[09:38:15] <gnarf> triggering .focus() ?
[09:38:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:38:28] <rwaldron> err
[09:38:36] <gnarf> have you tried delaying the test to the next loop?
[09:38:39] <rwaldron> am i missing something in your jsfiddle?
[09:38:41] <gnarf> setImmediately
[09:38:41] <gnarf> ;)
[09:38:53] <rwaldron> how would blurrinessLevel ever get added?
[09:39:16] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: it's not added the first time, that fiddle is just a reduction of the unit test showing the event is/isn't fired
[09:39:23] <rwaldron> oh cool
[09:39:25] <rwaldron> so... dig this
[09:39:26] <DaveMethvin> gnarf i see your point
[09:39:37] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/nxgVN/1/
[09:39:41] <DaveMethvin> of course then why does it work in fiddle
[09:39:44] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^
[09:39:58] <rwaldron> (run in IE9)
[09:40:06] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: because its fully async
[09:40:15] <gnarf> the elem is getting removed before the focus happens?
[09:40:19] <gnarf> in your test
[09:40:21] <gnarf> thats my theory
[09:40:32] <DaveMethvin> and you're sticking to it :)
[09:40:37] <DaveMethvin> i think i tried with it removed too
[09:40:42] <DaveMethvin> er, not removed
[09:40:46] <DaveMethvin> lemme see
[09:40:50] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin did you see my fiddle?
[09:40:57] <DaveMethvin> eyah what changed?
[09:41:07] <rwaldron> well, put your cursor in the box
[09:41:16] <rwaldron> it fires with "focusin"
[09:41:19] * rwaldron shrugs
[09:41:24] <rwaldron> then i realized thats not helpful at all
[09:41:39] <rwaldron> you're trying to fire the thing programmatically
[09:41:41] <rwaldron> i'll shut up now
[09:41:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah sorry i need a differ b/c i don't see the code change
[09:42:00] <rwaldron> no worries
[09:42:01] <DaveMethvin> oh focusin!
[09:42:06] <rwaldron> yeah, forget it though
[09:42:11] <rwaldron> still requires a person
[09:42:25] <DaveMethvin> damn people, screwing up our unit tests
[09:42:42] <DaveMethvin> just a sec, gotta switch branches
[09:43:35] <DaveMethvin> damn 100 bytes ... that makes me sad
[09:43:47] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/nxgVN/3/embedded/result/
[09:43:54] * DaveMethvin shakes fist at gnarf for taunting me with size info :)
[09:44:07] <gnarf> hey - timmywil requested it
[09:44:09] <gnarf> i just complied
[09:44:19] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin that is firing on it's own in IE9
[09:44:50] <DaveMethvin> sorry rwaldron i prolly wasn't clear .. the fiddle works (fires the event) but the unit test doesn't
[09:44:51] <DaveMethvin> in ie9
[09:45:01] <rwaldron> gotcha
[09:45:06] <DaveMethvin> and i just dont get it
[09:45:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://jsfiddle.net/nxgVN/4/ in ie9 says what?
[09:45:30] <gnarf> does OMG happen after or before ? :)
[09:45:57] <DaveMethvin> after
[09:45:59] <DaveMethvin> :P
[09:46:06] <gnarf> hrm
[09:46:10] <gnarf> but not in the unit?
[09:46:57] <DaveMethvin> i just commented out the delete and unbind at the end, still not firing
[09:47:20] <DaveMethvin> of course now i get a memory leak reported since i didn't unbind ... :)
[09:47:47] <DaveMethvin> but interestingly enough the now-visible box did not get focus, the cursor isn't in it
[09:48:01] <DaveMethvin> oh yes it did
[09:48:11] <DaveMethvin> i must have just clicked off it
[09:48:36] <gnarf> i really wish i had ie9
[09:48:50] <DaveMethvin> now THERE's something i've never heard anyone say before
[09:48:56] <gnarf> :)
[09:49:03] <gnarf> is it ie9 only? or ie8 as well?
[09:49:18] <DaveMethvin> well since ie9 didn't work i didnt' bother to check
[09:49:43] <gnarf> well after i finish cloning this ie8 vm so i can upgrade it to 9
[09:49:48] <gnarf> i'll look again :)
[09:50:44] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, same breakage in IE7 so they're all conspiring against me
[09:51:20] <rwaldron> so it looks like filter is never run?
[09:51:34] <DaveMethvin> right, i put a breakpoint and it isn't
[09:51:40] <DaveMethvin> also the event never seems to be triggered
[09:51:43] <rwaldron> yeah
[09:51:49] <DaveMethvin> so that explains why filter isn't run :)
[09:51:56] <gnarf> maybe its the blur that isn't working
[09:52:03] <rwaldron> i pulled the branch, so I'm poking around the source
[09:52:17] <DaveMethvin> if it was a failure in blur the first event woudl fire tho
[09:52:27] <gnarf> so neither event is firing?
[09:52:33] <DaveMethvin> right, neither one
[09:53:16] <rwaldron> hm
[09:53:20] <gnarf> what about a console.log( document.activeElement ) ?
[09:53:25] <rwaldron> i just changed the event name to something else and it works
[09:53:28] <rwaldron> you probably knew that
[09:53:31] <gnarf> just curious if its actually switching
[09:53:51] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: like what event?
[09:53:56] <rwaldron> hahaha
[09:54:00] <rwaldron> the word "fuck"
[09:54:02] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:54:06] <rwaldron> and trigger("fuck")
[09:54:11] <DaveMethvin> oh sure, if you trigger
[09:54:14] <DaveMethvin> but that's not a native event
[09:54:20] <DaveMethvin> although it woudl be sweet if it was
[09:54:36] <DaveMethvin> div.onfuck = function()
[09:54:37] <rwaldron> rght, but it wasnt working by triggering focus either
[09:54:52] <gnarf> onfuck="alert( peen(5) );"
[09:55:23] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin: click works
[09:55:27] <rwaldron> bind("click")
[09:55:34] <rwaldron> [0].click()
[09:55:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah but try in chrome/ff
[09:56:02] <rwaldron> works in chrome
[09:56:18] <rwaldron> works in FF
[09:56:43] <DaveMethvin> damn, there was some reason why i didn't use click
[09:56:50] <DaveMethvin> i thought it broke somewhere
[09:57:17] <DaveMethvin> like, i tried click but it broke
[09:57:19] <DaveMethvin> last night
[09:58:11] <rwaldron> click is a mouseevent
[09:58:15] <rwaldron> with mouseProps
[09:58:34] <DaveMethvin> oh right
[09:58:41] <DaveMethvin> well let me clobber it and see if it works otherwise
[09:58:42] <rwaldron> fails your clobber test
[09:58:50] <gnarf> so hrm... .trigger("focus") wasn't working?
[09:59:00] <rwaldron> but we could save the real hook, define our own and restore it
[10:00:05] <rwaldron> wwwwwwwwwwooorrrks
[10:00:08] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: appears so
[10:00:27] <gnarf> thats a little scary - why wouldn't .trigger() call the event bound?
[10:00:59] <gnarf> removing the [0] right?
[10:01:18] <DaveMethvin> oh i think i know the reason for that

[10:05:00] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (6.596s ago): Event Prop Hooks, #8789
[10:05:12] <rwaldron> i should close the original
[10:05:18] <DaveMethvin> eyah
[10:05:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah even
[10:05:29] <rwaldron> closed
[10:05:33] <rwaldron> with a note for the new one
[10:05:45] <DaveMethvin> but anyway gnarf, if ie isn't firing the event on focus then we aren't calling the handlers
[10:06:20] <DaveMethvin> now for as why ie isn't firing the event i don't know. i do know that ie will not let you focus a hidden element
[10:06:30] <gnarf> right
[10:06:34] <gnarf> but it passes in the fiddle
[10:06:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah and in the unit i speicfically put it in the body and had a chekc in there to make sure it was visible
[10:07:05] <DaveMethvin> so it had no excuse for failing afaik
[10:07:32] <rwaldron> No Excuse!
[10:07:44] <DaveMethvin> ie don't need no stinking excuse
[10:08:17] <rwaldron> aaaaaaahahahaha
[10:08:21] <rwaldron> ok, i need food
[10:08:26] <DaveMethvin> eat!
[10:12:04] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/3JmEd/1/ mini qunit :)
[10:16:40] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: so what's strange is that it works there -- the error is related to changes that are only on the branch, but the first event fired
[10:20:48] <gnarf> hey DaveMethvin
[10:20:52] <gnarf> got it to work with focus
[10:21:00] <DaveMethvin> so what did you do?
[10:21:44] <gnarf> wrapped everything starting from unbind to the end with setTimeout(...,0) and added start() to the second event handler - made it an asyncTest
[10:21:47] <gnarf> and it works in ie
[10:22:20] <DaveMethvin> so you were right all along ...
[10:22:25] <gnarf> yeah
[10:23:05] <DaveMethvin> i always underestimate ie's stupidity
[10:23:16] <gnarf> but
[10:23:19] <gnarf> what doesn't make sense
[10:23:35] <gnarf> is why http://jsfiddle.net/nxgVN/4/ appears correct
[10:24:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah that is why i didn't think it was an async prob
[10:24:12] <DaveMethvin> i had done something similar last night
[10:25:12] <DaveMethvin> oh well i guess we'll leave it with click, i am SOOO tired of this patch
[10:25:18] <DaveMethvin> but this is good to know
[10:25:19] <gnarf> aha
[10:25:39] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/nxgVN/8/ in ie
[10:26:03] <gnarf> apparently - focusin was working
[10:26:04] <gnarf> :)
[10:26:08] <gnarf> "focus" isnt
[10:26:43] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[10:26:44] <jmotta> I have a string that was rendered in my html as a return of a db query, but there are double white spaces on it and when I obtain these strings using jquery the double white spaces disappear (e.g. the original string was "something  here" and when I obtain the value I get "something here")
[10:26:58] <gnarf> support in #jquery ? :)
[10:27:07] <DaveMethvin> jmotta: try #jquery although i don't see jquery in there anywhere
[10:27:33] <jmotta> hm
[10:27:36] <jmotta> thanks
[10:27:42] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, i ran into some weirdness with .focus() in my mask unit tests
[10:27:54] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: only reason i knew to suggest delaying looking for it
[10:28:26] <DaveMethvin> actually let me ask you about a change i made to fix a different bug .. now i'm starting to worry about it
[10:29:04] <DaveMethvin> in 1.7 i have focus/blur fire the native focus/blur method, and *that* fires the focus/blur event and we run handlers off that
[10:29:29] <DaveMethvin> in 1.6 we ran the handlers directly, then fired the method and blocked the handlers from running a second time
[10:29:49] <DaveMethvin> which ensures the handlers fire even if ie doesn't focus or blur
[10:30:17] <DaveMethvin> so it seems like this test case is saying that might not be a good idea
[10:30:35] <gnarf> well apparently neither is your "blocking"
[10:30:41] <gnarf> might cause a dupe fire right?
[10:31:22] <DaveMethvin> that's a result of how trigger() has always fired events, it's backwards of native events
[10:31:47] <DaveMethvin> normally you run the DOM .click() or whatever method, and that fires onclick, and runs handlers
[10:32:09] <DaveMethvin> but in jquery we run the handlers then run the DOM .click() method but  block any event that comes out of it
[10:32:59] <DaveMethvin> so for focus/blur I was trying to do it the "right" way  and run the dom method, letting that fire events
[10:33:26] <DaveMethvin> which solves a few sticky ui problems with the fact that focus doesn't bubble for example but focusin does
[10:33:27] <gnarf> switching that order around might cause regression?
[10:33:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah technically it could
[10:34:24] <DaveMethvin> the main problem is that .trigger("blur") is nothing like a native blur event
[10:34:56] <DaveMethvin> but now it's a lot more like a native blur event in 1.7
[10:35:16] <DaveMethvin> it runs the blur method, then triggers blur on the target, then triggers focusout on the parents

[10:43:24] <DaveMethvin> btw there seems to be NO working precompiled node.js that works with pulley
[10:43:39] <DaveMethvin> that's what was causing the crash i get
[10:43:44] <DaveMethvin> but the older one crashes too
[10:43:46] <timmywil> hmmmmmm?
[10:43:53] <timmywil> what version?
[10:44:50] <DaveMethvin> i am looking for the version of the one i'm using, no luck
[10:45:04] <DaveMethvin> node -v ftw
[10:45:14] <DaveMethvin> 0.4.7
[10:45:22] <DaveMethvin> that's the one that works well enough for make
[10:45:33] <timmywil> hmm, ok, well i'm on 0.4.8
[10:46:01] <timmywil> can't imagine pulley wouldn't work with 0.4.7 tho
[10:46:11] <DaveMethvin> well, something is broke with it

[19:28:13] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: do the unit tests run ok for you on master in ie7?
[19:29:01] <timmywil> they did earlier today
[19:29:09] <timmywil> i'd check now, but i'm in the middle of getText
[19:29:19] <DaveMethvin> that's fine
[19:29:29] <DaveMethvin> let me back up a bit and see if it gets better
[19:29:38] <DaveMethvin> seems to be in support.js
[19:32:21] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: so I rewrote barberjoy's test and it seems his is slower
[19:32:46] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[19:32:52] <DaveMethvin> how about using textContent/innerText?
[19:32:52] <timmywil> i did it on a selections of divs rather than a selection of the body element
[19:33:05] <timmywil> haven't gotten that far
[19:33:18] <DaveMethvin> if we could use them i think that would be the fastest way
[19:33:26] <DaveMethvin> but of couse you need the recursive stuff for xml
[19:33:28] <DaveMethvin> still
[19:33:51] <DaveMethvin> there was another implementation in the related ticket
[19:34:34] <timmywil> yea, looking into that one now
[19:34:55] <DaveMethvin> docs#3144 ... took me that long to load the page
[19:34:56] <bot-t> [#3144] Inconsistent cross-browser results from .text() method (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/3144
[19:36:50] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: so you like his solution for the bug fix?
[19:37:09] <DaveMethvin> i liked it when i played with it, seemed good to me
[19:37:18] <timmywil> cool
[19:37:45] <DaveMethvin> john mentioned that we'd had probs with textContent/innerText but i think those probs are gone
[19:38:00] <DaveMethvin> and the biggest pains are from ie, but this makes them better
[19:40:30] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: here's what the new code looks like in ie7: http://i.imgur.com/DZzjc.png
[19:40:45] <DaveMethvin> and for reasonable browsers there's no change
[19:41:48] <timmywil> sounds good to me
[19:42:21] <timmywil> i have an idea for improving getText performance too.  I think I can work the bugfix in and still keep the code pretty short.
[19:43:03] <timmywil> we'll see
[20:05:42] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: according to my tests, the performance loss is minor with the bugfix and barber's getText is noticeably slower
[20:05:53] <timmywil> my idea didn't pan out
[20:06:24] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: which one is barber's gettext?
[20:06:44] <timmywil> the PR
[20:06:54] <timmywil> with nextSibling
[20:06:57] <DaveMethvin> k found it
[20:07:24] <DaveMethvin> maybe this one instead? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3144#comment:2
[20:07:41] <timmywil> yea, that's the bugfix i'm talking about
[20:07:49] <timmywil> performance loss is minor
[20:08:35] <DaveMethvin> hmm i would have expected it to be faster if anything
[20:08:50] <DaveMethvin> altho ... maybe it should not query the text properties twice and keep them in a local var
[20:09:14] <DaveMethvin> poor browser prolly does what we do, traverse the tree and collect the strings :)
[20:13:15] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ok, my test was bad
[20:13:38] <timmywil> but wow
[20:13:50] <timmywil> using textContent is a boost
[20:14:06] <DaveMethvin> hey, C code has got to be faster than recursive javascript
[20:14:38] <timmywil> certainly
[20:15:36] <timmywil> barber's is better than 164, but the bugfix is faster than barber's
[20:15:50] <timmywil> :P
[20:16:16] <DaveMethvin> hope it's not too much bigger
[20:16:40] <DaveMethvin> but also it's good that it fixes some issues with .text() on IE
[20:47:09] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: need to sleep.  I'll pick it up again tomorrow.
[20:47:20] <timmywil> the bugfix causes some problems in manipulation
[20:47:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i'm tired too and my patches aren't behaving
[20:47:41] <timmywil> I think it's because innerText allows newlines
[20:47:49] <DaveMethvin> amazing how tough these things can be
[20:47:53] <timmywil> but i'll look into it more tomorrow
[20:48:01] <DaveMethvin> ok, well maybe tomorrow, gnite
[20:50:33] <timmywil> hmm, btw, it's only a problem in IE with appending elements for some reason
