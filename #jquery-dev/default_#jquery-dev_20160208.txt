[12:47:00] <markelog> sorry for going offline my battery died
[13:12:12] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol markelog DaveMethvin: Just got back from lunch. What did you want to know regarding jQuery UI and https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2895?
[13:12:15] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin closed issue #2908: 3.0.0-beta1: implement unhandledrejection event 02https://git.io/vgBSA
[13:12:55] <scott_gonzalez> We do use .offsetParent() in a few places, but I don't know of any issues with the previous implementation.
[13:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I *think* the few uses we have will go away with the interaction rewrites.
[13:13:12] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: any SVG-related uses in UI?
[13:13:30] <DaveMethvin> that's supposedly where these warnings come out
[13:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> We had this: https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8335
[13:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> Mike closed it three years ago as not supported though.
[13:14:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah, sounds like firefox never supported it
[13:15:37] <DaveMethvin> it only works in core by "accident" I think but it has worked consistently since like jquery 1.3 on chrome and svg
[13:15:51] <DaveMethvin> so i am betting there are people out there using it
[13:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> There's also this, which admittedly I haven't even looked at before; https://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/14721
[13:16:20] <DaveMethvin> but if they yank it there isn't much we can do so shrug
[13:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> Though I don't think that last bug is related to jQuery's offset handling at all.
[13:17:24] <DaveMethvin> i'm just tired of svg acting enough like html that people think they can treat it like html
[13:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, check out the response on SO: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33040911/svg-icons-dissapears-in-windows-10-ie-11-using-jquery-sortable
[13:18:07] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they just keep shoehorning it in.
[13:18:43] <DaveMethvin> ok gotta run
[15:31:08] <m_gol> DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez: the SVG part is not the most important here IMHO as we don't officially support it. The main part for me is that all offsetSomething APIs are considered legacy, don't receive "fixes" and browser vendors advise to switch to alternative APIs, mostly getBoundingClientRect(). But there's no equivalent there for offsetParent, hence the question if this API is useful and, if so, what are its use cases
[15:31:08] <m_gol>  so that a new alternative API for that one can be proposed. That's where I wanted to hear UI input.
[15:33:25] <scott_gonzalez> I just replied on the issue. I don't think uses of .offsetParent() will remain.
[15:33:46] <m_gol> k, thx
[15:33:55] <scott_gonzalez> It's only used in code that everyone is afraid to touch ;-)
