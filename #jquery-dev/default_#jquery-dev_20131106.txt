[07:50:19] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin those data tickets are all done now
[08:05:39] <gnarf> rwaldron: did you land the backport too?

[08:06:45] <rwaldron> gnarf no, sorry
[08:06:49] <gnarf> rwaldron I'll land it
[08:06:53] <rwaldron> gnarf can you/

[08:24:27] <gnarf> rwaldron: re http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14376
[08:24:42] <gnarf> rwaldron: it feels like some day in the future, we need to pull the trigger on that
[08:24:51] <rwaldron> ?
[08:24:54] <rwaldron> On what?
[08:25:07] <gnarf> it would be nice to be able to just import the data-* attribs from .dataset
[08:25:26] <gnarf> and if foo-42 should be ['foo-42'] thats what we should do?
[08:26:10] <rwaldron> so then...
[08:26:20] <rwaldron> what does data("foo42") return?
[08:26:25] <gnarf> undefined
[08:26:40] <rwaldron> not today
[08:26:47] <rwaldron> not according to our test suite
[08:26:52] <gnarf> data("foo-42") and .data("foo42") should be distinct keys according to the spec
[08:26:56] <rwaldron> yep
[08:27:13] <rwaldron> but that was broken long before you and I took over data
[08:27:17] <gnarf> we should fix that
[08:27:20] <gnarf> DaveMethvin?
[08:27:32] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin and I talked about this yesterday
[08:27:48] <gnarf> can this be a migrate?
[08:27:56] <rwaldron> maybe
[08:28:02] <gnarf> warning - key includes /-(\d)/
[08:28:16] <rwaldron> yeah, maybe
[08:28:43] <rwaldron> but that isn't broken
[08:28:50] <rwaldron> data-foo-123
[08:29:23] <rwaldron> if you ignore the data- part, yes
[08:29:32] <rwaldron> but this is a breaking change
[08:29:54] <rwaldron> and it would have to be broken in both 1.x and 2.x
[08:30:30] <gnarf> $({}).data( "foo-123", "test" ).data().foo123 === "test"; // true
[08:30:47] <rwaldron> that's not the bug
[08:30:57] <gnarf> i'm saying that would need to change too
[08:31:03] <rwaldron> oh right
[08:31:07] <rwaldron> that's the break
[08:31:16] <gnarf> "foo-123" and "foo123" are distinct data keys
[08:31:21] <rwaldron> $({}).data( "foo-123", "test" ).data()["foo-123"] === "test"; // true
[08:31:29] <rwaldron> I agree
[08:31:33] <gnarf> pretty sure thats false right now ^
[08:31:37] <rwaldron> correct
[08:31:40] <rwaldron> that's the break
[08:31:57] <rwaldron> didn't I say that?
[08:32:07] <gnarf> you did
[08:32:10] <rwaldron> sorry, I think what I said was unclear
[08:32:13] <rwaldron> anyway
[08:32:15] <rwaldron> I'm with you
[08:32:21] <gnarf> but DaveMethvin ?
[08:32:24] <rwaldron> I'm just playing this out in my head
[08:32:27] <rwaldron> it's not good
[08:32:56] <rwaldron> honestly, I think putting numbers in your attr names should be a fireable offense
[08:34:01] <gibson042> yet another case for the roman numeral Unicode characters? :P
[08:36:01] <gnarf> consider: deepEqual( $('<span data-foo-42="meaning" data-foo42="life">').data(), { "foo-42": "meaning", foo42: "life" } );
[08:36:41] <gnarf> monday's agenda?
[08:37:18] <gnarf> ^ totally broken
[08:37:20] <gnarf> currently
[08:38:10] <gnarf> $('<span data-foo-42="meaning" data-foo42="life">').data() // Object {foo42: "life"}
[08:38:10] <gnarf> $('<span data-foo42="life" data-foo-42="meaning" >').data() // Object {foo42: "life"}
[08:40:12] <gibson042> I'm for breaking behavior changes in 1.12/2.2 to sync with the spec, with some measure of backcompat in jquery-migrate
[09:07:07] <snover> maybe you just donâ€™t have $.fn.data try to pull data attributes :)
[09:58:44] <gnarf> oh in a world where....
[10:13:46] <gibson042> what's our current best practice for reporting Chrome/Blink bugs? their dataset implementation ignores data-* attributes containing a hyphen followed by a number: http://jsfiddle.net/mmN3c/
[10:25:30] <gnarf> gibson042: i think it was already reported by rwaldron 
[10:26:01] <rwaldron> gnarf gibson042 yep
[10:26:15] <gibson042> cool; I must've missed that
[10:26:22] <rwaldron> it was linked in that ticket
[10:26:26] <rwaldron> it was also a dupe
[10:26:37] <rwaldron> so I updated with a link to to the orig
[10:27:36] <gibson042> that might be it
[10:27:43] <gibson042> at any rate, sounds like we're good
[10:27:44] <gibson042> thanks
