[07:56:44] <arschmitz> timmywil: Hey any update on the offset issue? would like to figure out what if any changes we need to make in ui and mobile and get tests passing again
[08:30:44] <timmywil> arschmitz: sorry we haven't gotten to it yet. We still plan on returning zeros for disconnected elements.
[08:43:01] <arschmitz> timmywil: so just to be clear your going to switch back to zeros instead of undefined?

[08:43:18] <arschmitz> awesome thanks
[08:44:49] <arschmitz> thats all i needed i can live with failing tests for now as long as i know what i do dont need to fix
