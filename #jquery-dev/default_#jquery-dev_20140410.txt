[08:05:16] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: we should build a bunch of these :p http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:123420
[08:05:45] <arschmitz> for sure
[08:06:11] <arschmitz> would be awesome for the touch event testing
[08:07:03] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: could make that into a pretty sweet talk / demo too lol
[08:07:22] <arschmitz> get a whole bunch of those going with cameras on them
[08:07:25] <ryanneufeld> yeah, especially if you could get it running fast enough
[08:10:53] <arschmitz> i would need a lot more desk space for all those lol

[08:14:12] <arschmitz> m_gol: its actually compatible with Selenium
[08:14:21] <m_gol> :)
[08:14:23] <arschmitz> designed by the creator of selenium
[08:17:07] <m_gol> what I meant by this is that the whole concept of WebDriver here is moved outside the browser & even outside of the device :)
