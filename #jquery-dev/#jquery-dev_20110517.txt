[07:08:44] <jaubourg> hi
[07:10:03] <timmywil> ciao jaubourg
[07:57:39] <davidmurdoch> the link to http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui.git.css on code.jquery.com should point to http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.css
[07:57:50] <davidmurdoch> :-)
[08:05:09] <JohnResig> I'm not sure who's in charge of it - but the link to jquery.min.js is wrong too
[08:09:17] <timmywil> it is? http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.1.min.js
[08:09:31] <davidmurdoch> yah, its broken for me to
[08:09:35] <davidmurdoch> http://code.jquery.com/jquerymin.js
[08:10:05] <timmywil> that doesn't look right at all
[08:10:29] <timmywil> http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js
[08:10:30] <davidmurdoch> whatchutalkinbout?

[13:45:35] <jqp> is the problem in this question a bug in $.ajax(), or simply a programming error on my part?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6035987/can-i-use-jquery-prefilters-to-detect-onreadystatechange-events-where-readystate
[13:46:35] <jqp> the question might also be relevant to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8327
[14:01:37] <timmywil> jrburke: I noticed you updated the jquery sample project.  You took out the bit about setting the jquery path to a blank file for the optimizer, but if loaded from a cdn, won't this still be required when tracing dependencies?
[14:03:51] <timmywil> anyway, loading locally is simple enough
[14:04:10] <jrburke> timmywil: eek! yes and looks like i have a markdown formatting issue displaying the readme too. i'll fix in just a moment
[14:04:45] <timmywil> jrburke: oh woops, :P
[14:07:54] <rwaldron> timmywil docs#9319 I have a test case for that
[14:07:56] <bot-t> [#9319] Default val() getter expects a String returned (function() { ""progress"" ]) - http://jqbug.com/9319
[14:08:58] <timmywil> rwaldron: cool
[14:10:19] <rwaldron> i can own it and patch it
[14:10:25] <rwaldron> wasnt sure if you were already on that
[14:10:48] <timmywil> rwaldron: nope, haven't gotten to it. go for it. :)
[14:11:10] <rwaldron> cool
[14:21:52] <ryanneufed> paul_irish: yt?
[14:22:23] <paul_irish> hi
[14:22:25] <paul_irish> sup
[14:22:28] <paul_irish> its on the cdn
[14:22:36] <ryanneufed> Sweet, ths
[14:22:41] <paul_irish> as of 6pm yesterday
[14:22:48] <ryanneufed> I was actually gonna ask about transforms stuffs
[14:22:52] <paul_irish> o ok
[14:22:53] <paul_irish> sup
[14:23:17] <ryanneufed> with regards to css3 transforms
[14:23:33] <ryanneufed> I remember reading about using null transforms to decrease render times
[14:23:39] <ryanneufed> or was I having a dream?
[14:23:44] <ryanneufed> do you know about that?
[14:24:43] <paul_irish> its in my DOM perf talk that i videod not too long ago
[14:24:44] <ryanneufed> I'm trying to speed up the responsiveness of this http://beta.metrolyrics.com/born-this-way-lyrics-lady-gaga.html (u: omd p:omd)
[14:24:51] <paul_irish> transform: translatez(0);
[14:24:54] <ryanneufed> yea, I just watched that
[14:25:02] <ryanneufed> and our CSS guy is telling me I'm smoking crack
[14:25:14] <paul_irish> your css guy doesnt know this shit
[14:25:22] <ryanneufed> I'm pretty sure that i could use it to make it smoother
[14:25:30] <paul_irish> i depends.
[14:25:41] <ryanneufed> it usually does
[14:25:50] <gnarf> the "magic bullet" ? :)
[14:25:53] <paul_irish> are you gonna make a lyrics site that doesnt suck?
[14:26:05] <ryanneufed> we're working on it
[14:26:25] <ryanneufed> any suggestions to make it less sucky are openly welcomed
[14:27:43] <paul_irish> make it load fucking fast.
[14:27:50] <paul_irish> that's mostly all i want
[14:27:53] <paul_irish> it can have ads all over
[14:27:57] <paul_irish> but i want it to load fastttttttttttt
[14:28:02] <paul_irish> so FAST
[14:28:08] <ryanneufed> Tell the DFP guys to give us async ads then
[14:28:21] <ryanneufed> no one can do it
[14:28:24] <ryanneufed> it seems
[14:28:35] <paul_irish> you could lazy them in with iframes and all that jazz
[14:28:47] <paul_irish> also see ?g document.write ghostwrite
[14:28:48] <bot-t> paul_irish, GhostWriter -- Total Web Performance Control | Digital Fulcrum - http://digital-fulcrum.com/solutions/ghostwriter-complete-control/
[14:29:22] <paul_irish> ryanneufed: which part were you gonna apply the transform to
[14:29:38] <ryanneufed> when you hover over the lyrics
[14:29:52] <ryanneufed> and move around to highlight different lines
[14:30:12] <paul_irish> o
[14:30:16] <paul_irish> i wouldnt expect a benefit there
[14:30:21] <paul_irish> ryanneufed: can we move this to #html5 ?
[14:30:30] <ryanneufed> 100%
[14:36:29] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[14:36:38] <timmywil> rwaldron: sup
[14:37:27] <rwaldron> so, re: docs#9319
[14:37:29] <bot-t> so, [#9319] Default val() getter expects a String returned (function() { ""progress"" ]) - http://jqbug.com/9319
[14:37:36] <rwaldron> i agree with you
[14:37:53] <rwaldron> we should return a number if the value is _supposed_ to be a number
[14:38:13] <rwaldron> but peter made a good point just now that jQuery guarantees a string frm val()
[14:38:52] <rwaldron> from*
[14:39:09] <rwaldron> actually...
[14:39:24] <rwaldron> eh
[14:39:26] <rwaldron> yeah
[14:39:30] <rwaldron> string or an array of strings
[14:40:13] <timmywil> I think we can add number to the list of return types.  Most of the time (ie form inputs), a string would still be returned.
[14:40:28] <rwaldron> cool
[14:40:35] <rwaldron> i'm really just using your recommendation
[14:40:38] <rwaldron> but with my tests
[14:41:06] <rwaldron> can I include in you by name? i'm going to comment on the ticket noting that we discussed this
[14:42:03] <timmywil> you mean mention my name in the ticket?  that's cool.  no need to put my name in the code or anything.
[14:42:11] <rwaldron> yeah in the ticket
[14:44:06] <timmywil> DaveMethvin! we got another liposuction ticket! :D
[14:44:20] <DaveMethvin> where?!
[14:44:29] <timmywil> lol
[14:44:49] <rwaldron> moar penis enlargement!
[14:45:04] <DaveMethvin> man i deleted about three of those in the last day
[14:45:35] <DaveMethvin> but it's nice that they add pretty pictures in tickets, we need more pretty pictures
[14:45:43] <rwaldron> moar!
[14:45:47] <timmywil> i'm sure captcha has been mentioned before, why hasn't that happened?
[14:46:04] <DaveMethvin> i thought it did have some sort of spam filter
[14:46:10] <DaveMethvin> (just not a very good one i guess)
[14:47:08] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin or timmywil review? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/382
[14:48:11] <rwaldron> ~150 tests until 5000
[14:48:20] <rwaldron> 139
[14:50:08] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: would the valhooks be a better approach? It wouldn't clutter the main line case but we'd need to add exceptions for each of them (just 2 right now)
[14:50:56] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: are there other types that value can be?
[14:51:20] <DaveMethvin> hey i'm surprised at the doubles, i thought it was always a string
[14:51:27] <rwaldron> I considered valHooks... but then i read some spec stuff
[14:51:30] <DaveMethvin> so don't look at me :P
[14:51:57] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yea, so did I.  those w3c guys need a *facesmack*
[14:51:59] <rwaldron> while reading it occurred to me that these might not be the last to have value = number(double)
[14:52:17] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin timmywil its _not_even_real_
[14:52:27] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron:  sounds like you did the homework then ... would it hurt to always coerce the result to string?
[14:52:35] <rwaldron> if you put an integer in it... it's still an integer
[14:52:45] <rwaldron> like... 1 doesn't magically become 1.0
[14:53:01] <DaveMethvin> what is *wrong* with those w3c dudes?
[14:53:05] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin thought about that too, it seems along the same lines
[14:53:27] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it wouldn't hurt really, but it's not much longer to have it match the spec.  Most cases should hit the first check and be done.
[14:53:44] <rwaldron> what he said ^^
[14:53:51] <rwaldron> it very little code
[14:54:01] <DaveMethvin> sounds good to me
[14:54:06] <rwaldron> to be able to say "jQuery supports X"
[14:54:12] <rwaldron> people like that shit
[14:54:26] <DaveMethvin> jQuery supports Al Quaida
[14:54:31] <timmywil> jQuery supports "boolean attributes"??????
[14:54:42] <DaveMethvin> don't say "boolean attributes" again
[14:54:47] <timmywil> hahaha
[14:54:48] <rwaldron> hahahahahahah
[14:54:51] <DaveMethvin> AAAAAGHHHG!
[14:55:29] <DaveMethvin> i say we crash the next w3c meeting and pound the crap outta these guys
[14:55:52] <rwaldron> "dude... what were you thinking???/ THERE IS NO DOUBLE IN JAVASCRIPT"
[14:56:04] <rwaldron> ...which by default means html cant have it either
[14:56:28] <timmywil> w3c: we haz nuff stuff to do
[14:56:50] <DaveMethvin> Yeah we're busy breaking our own crap, we don't need you breaking stuff for us
[14:58:06] <DaveMethvin> damn this stuff in docs#9301 has me sad
[14:58:07] <bot-t> [#9301] Setting data() via an object with hyphenated keys create inaccessible data. (assigned bug) - http://jqbug.com/9301
[14:58:24] <DaveMethvin> another breaking change no matter which way we go
[14:58:43] <DaveMethvin> all we can do is document it
[14:58:47] <DaveMethvin> imo
[14:58:57] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i did some serious research trying to debunk that
[14:59:04] <rwaldron> because those look WRONG
[14:59:21] <rwaldron> i even made a fake document and it validated
[14:59:23] <rwaldron> :\
[14:59:44] <DaveMethvin> the problem started when we imported data- attributes into our own .data() because they have different rules about names
[15:00:18] <DaveMethvin> it's totally ok up to this point to say .data("abc-XX-v3\x04 ha ha ha", 43)
[15:00:31] <DaveMethvin> spaces, control chars, whatever
[15:00:41] <DaveMethvin> so now we're making dashes special
[15:00:50] <DaveMethvin> and 1.7 is proposing to make spaces special
[15:01:16] <DaveMethvin> i always think "what sane person would do this"
[15:01:47] <DaveMethvin> but then i found out there are a lot of insane people out there
[15:02:03] <DaveMethvin> and when you break the code of insane people you'd better hide :P
[15:02:10] <DaveMethvin> whoops gotta go, brb
[15:04:02] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i ask the same thing
[15:04:10] <rwaldron> if you have a data attr like...
[15:04:17] <rwaldron> data-some-junk-123
[15:04:20] <rwaldron> you're doing it wrong
[15:26:51] <gnarf> sigh
[15:27:54] <gnarf> does anyone know if any browsers don't convert color css like "aliceblue" to rgb() or #xxxxxx format: http://jsfiddle.net/v6ubF/ ?  -- if all browsers do this, I can dump the "color list" and try parsing it from jquery-color
[15:54:55] <JohnResig> gnarf: I think Opera doesn't
[15:54:58] <JohnResig> or was it IE
[15:55:03] <gnarf> JohnResig: ie6 :/
[15:55:05] <JohnResig> there is one that doesn't
[15:55:08] <JohnResig> ah, there we go
[15:55:09] <gnarf> fuckin ie6
[15:55:26] <gnarf> i'm seeing if i can work around somehow
[15:55:35] <gnarf> i'd love to drop that like ~2k of color names
[15:55:58] <ben_alman> hey JohnResig, what if, when a function was passed to $.fn.detach, it did this: https://gist.github.com/938767
[15:56:34] <gnarf> ben_alman: nifty
[15:56:50] <ben_alman> maybe if the function returned false it would become "async" i dunno
[15:57:09] <ben_alman> i'm probably going to make a jQuery plugin to do this, either way
[15:58:23] <gnarf> ben_alman: dedicated to the rewardjs winner? ;)
[15:58:51] <ben_alman> no i've already made that plugin: http://jsfiddle.net/cowboy/74QFk/
[16:03:41] <gnarf> ooo
[16:04:22] <gnarf> it seems if you use a textArea and .createTextRange().queryCommandValue("ForeColor") you can get at the parsed value in IE...
[16:04:27] <TonkaTruck> Shouldn't $.ajax() pass the parsed (according to dataType) server response to the error callback as it does the success callback?  This goes against REST response patterns, no?
[16:08:00] <TonkaTruck> I understand that it exists in the xhr object...but not parsed.  It's almost like $.ajax() demoted the server response for the error callback while rfc 2616 10.4 suggests that "the server SHOULD include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation".
[16:09:44] <TonkaTruck> I've collected a bunch of info on this...just wondering if anyone thinks I should post it to the jquery forums or if it's a lost cause...
[16:12:30] <rwaldron> ben_alman where is "done"
[16:12:50] <ben_alman> in teh codes
[16:12:56] <rwaldron> nope
[16:13:01] <ben_alman> passed to the callback (if async)
[16:13:29] <ben_alman> do you think i'd post code i hadn't tested?
[16:13:31] <ben_alman> :P
[16:13:31] <rwaldron> i'm too tired to be looking at anything
[16:13:34] <rwaldron> nevermin
[16:13:40] <ben_alman> i have unit tests linked
[16:13:48] <ben_alman> GO TO SLEEP
[16:14:02] <rwaldron> i've reviewed about 20 tickets, most of them _several_ times today :\
[16:14:12] <rwaldron> cool, i'll look later
[16:14:14] <rwaldron> afk
[16:14:17] <rwaldron> <3z
[16:31:21] <gnarf> JohnResig: http://jsfiddle.net/v6ubF/8/  --- http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2009/10/convert-any-colour-value-to-hex-in-msie/
[16:31:32] <gnarf> looks like that will work for IE's
[16:31:40] <gnarf> but the createPopup() use kinda sucks
[16:31:50] <JohnResig> lol, yes
[16:32:05] <gnarf> maybe a display: none hidden div?
[16:32:13] <JohnResig> can't be display none
[16:32:24] <gnarf> hrm
[16:37:02] <gnarf> any wise advice?
[16:51:17] <gnarf> createPopup() seems to be the only method I can figure out that isn't giving me this strange "The element has already been set as a drop target" error...
[16:51:29] <gnarf> when I try to .queryCommandValue("ForeColor")
[17:00:08] <gnarf> just trying to think of a way to get rid of that huge list of colors...
[17:04:33] <gnarf> i'm not sure its worth doing if createPopup() is the only workable solution in IE tho...
[19:28:40] <stuart-> im having trouble getting a list view to filter. im using jquerymobile nightly
[19:28:44] <stuart-> is there any special tags i have to use other than data-filter="true" and data-role="listview"
[19:29:06] <stuart-> for the search filter to filter results?
[19:29:15] <stuart-> the search bar is rendering, but it doesnt filter....
[20:24:29] <locksmithdon> Hello all. Is _super the only thing changing in jquery-ui 1.9 core?
[20:25:05] <locksmithdon> well, I know _super is new for 1.9, but I'm interested in all changes and I couldn't find it on the wiki
[20:36:33] <ajpiano> locksmithdon: the other thing is changing is so called "self inheritance" https://gist.github.com/962848
[20:36:43] <ajpiano> a widget can extend from itself
[20:37:45] <locksmithdon> Thanks Adam, I saw that in your deck from jqcon and I still can't appreciate why a widget would need to do that
[20:38:18] <locksmithdon> widget inheritance is obvious, but why from itself?
[20:38:56] <locksmithdon> btw, I have a gist for you too :) is this just an oversight?
[20:39:07] <locksmithdon> https://gist.github.com/977948
[21:15:01] <locksmithdon> I probably should have used ajpiano instead of Adam :)
[21:15:44] <ajpiano> locksmithdon: lol :)
[21:16:04] <ajpiano> the reason is because a lot of the time, someone just wants to modify some small aspect of the behaviour of a widget
[21:16:32] <ajpiano> without like, creating a whole other namespace and widget, you just want dialog to have some other events or duckpunch a method or something like that
[21:16:52] <locksmithdon> ah, now I get it. thanks, that helps
[21:17:01] <ajpiano> without the self-inheritance, you had to like, make $.widget("foo.mygreatdialog",$.ui.dialog, {});
[21:17:04] <ajpiano> ok cool
[21:17:14] <locksmithdon> and then bridge, right?
[21:17:18] <ajpiano> yep
[21:17:24] <locksmithdon> gotcha
[21:17:44] <ajpiano> locksmithdon: are you don smith??
[21:17:57] <locksmithdon> I'm making good progress on my widget chapter. I'll try to fire it off to you by the end of the week
[21:18:01] <locksmithdon> I am
[21:18:04] <ajpiano> aha!
[21:18:16] <ajpiano> i'm looking at your business card now, it's still in here
[21:18:17] <ajpiano> sounds good
[21:18:26] <locksmithdon> cool :)
[22:02:45] <locksmithdon> http://jqueryui.com/docs/Developer_Guide indicates the base destroy should be called before doing other cleanup, but I can't see any reason why it can't be called last. Does order matter? ajpiano?
[22:28:43] <ajpiano> locksmithdon: no i don't believe that code sample is prescriptive
[23:49:05] <sac> is it intended that when binding .live('mouseenter', ... the event.type in the callback is mouseover and not mouseenter? it was mouseenter before 1.6
[23:51:46] <sac> also no mention about this change in the change log
