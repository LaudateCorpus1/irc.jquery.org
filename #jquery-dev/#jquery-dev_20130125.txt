[12:15:22] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: ajpiano: in a bit i'll be introducing you to a googler who's been working on jsleakcheck, a tool to discover and help you avoid memory leaks at author-time
[12:15:56] <paul_irish> it's very closure lib compatible but she really is excited about making it have 1st class support for  jQuery 
[12:17:39] <paul_irish> anyway.. ill holler next week or so
[12:18:38] <ajpiano> sounds good paul_irish
[12:18:47] <DaveMethvin> cool thanks paul_irish
[14:23:40] <scott_gonzalez> We need something like http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/
[14:23:43] <scott_gonzalez> That's pretty slick.
[14:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> This view is especially nice: http://contributors.rubyonrails.org/releases
[14:26:20] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: agreed, seems like github should be showing us these kind of slices
[14:26:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'd be nice if it did.
[14:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> Could probably build it pretty easily.
[14:27:01] <ajpiano> http://www.clahub.com/ is also kind of interesting
[14:27:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah saw that
[14:32:31] <snover> on the tweeters?
[15:05:11] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! Can I treat a jQuery object like an array and .push( element ) to it?
[15:05:36] <_|Nix|_> I don't want to create a new object every time I add an element.
[15:06:48] <_|Nix|_> I have a situation where I need to run what is essentially a custom selector, but it needs to collect the matching elements asynchronously. It's OK if at the time I use it the collection process has not yet completed.
[15:07:37] <_|Nix|_> However, I'd like to have a jQuery object from the very first element I add, because I want to be able to use all the jQuery goodness like .not( someOtherElements ) and stuff like that.
[15:11:04] <_|Nix|_> The use case: I'm trying to import UI's :tabbable selector into jQM's popup widget, but I have found that running $( ":tabbable" ) on a decent-sized page increases the delay from button click to the appearance of the popup by, like, half a second on iOS 6.0.1 ...
[15:11:12] <_|Nix|_> Not a good UX, I'd say.
[15:11:14] <paul_irish> is jquery-migrate recommended for production?
[15:11:16] <paul_irish> seems like a bad idea
[15:11:21] <paul_irish> people want it on the google CDN
[15:11:50] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: ajpiano ^
[15:21:01] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: the migrate plugin in minified form doesn't generate warnings, so at that point it is just a compat layer to make old code work 
[15:21:08] <DaveMethvin> so it could be useful on production sites
[15:21:11] <paul_irish> aiight
[15:21:26] <DaveMethvin> i'd prefer people fix their code tho :D
[15:21:31] <paul_irish> you just replied to a 3 year old feature request of mine :)
[15:22:04] <DaveMethvin> but the answer was still "no" right? So i'm consistent. :)
[15:22:32] <paul_irish> yup
[15:22:36] <paul_irish> i agree with that call
