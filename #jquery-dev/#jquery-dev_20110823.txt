[06:03:43] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: I have a coupla new pulls in for 1.6.3, at this point we are down to only a few open tix
[06:04:21] <DaveMethvin> right now i'm on the train and connecitivy isn't too good
[06:04:21] <DaveMethvin> of course neaither is my typing
[06:05:11] <DaveMethvin> oh and i can't get to the bugs site atm, amtrak has it on a ban list
[06:09:31] <jaubourg> tired
[06:09:35] <jaubourg> hi there
[06:24:19] <DaveMethvin> hi jaubourg!
[06:24:50] <DaveMethvin> we're looking to release 1.6.3 in the next coupla days
[06:25:23] <DaveMethvin> i tagged a couple of tickets that might interest you, one was asking about a potential typo in ajax
[06:31:55] <timmywil> jaubourg: hi!
[06:32:02] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: cool
[06:32:09] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: and go amtrak
[06:33:14] <jaubourg> Dave: ok, I'll check this but later in the day, freaking busy right now
[06:33:50] <jaubourg> life's nightmarishingly full these days
[06:38:22] <DaveMethvin> i will try to wrap up whatever is left in the 1.6.3 queue tonight
[06:45:01] <jaubourg> typo thingy already fixed
[07:03:17] <tbranyen> where is julian :(
[07:03:22] <tbranyen> i has ajax question
[07:03:58] <aaronmcadam> he was here a few mins ago
[07:04:40] <tbranyen> bah
[07:04:49] <tbranyen> anyone else familiar with ajaxTransport?
[07:12:43] <jaubourg> yop
[07:12:56] <tbranyen> jaubourg: :D
[07:13:21] <jaubourg> what can I do for you?
[07:13:56] <tbranyen> i got from the docs here: http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/#Transports that if i omit the dataTypes to listen for, it'll intercept all requests
[07:14:22] <jaubourg> if no other catch-all transport intercepted first, of course
[07:14:48] <jaubourg> wanna intercept before existing ones?
[07:15:06] <tbranyen> yeah, the weird thing is that if i provide a list of all the dataTypes as the first param it catches everything
[07:15:10] <jaubourg> (usually, the idea is to add transports as fallbacks)
[07:15:14] <tbranyen> does that bump it up in priority or something?
[07:15:23] <tbranyen> jaubourg: i just found it works amazing for simulating ajax requests
[07:15:46] <jaubourg> no, the structure is inspected first for the data type, then  for catchall ("*")
[07:15:48] <tbranyen> but i want to intercept custom dataTypes as well
[07:15:54] <jaubourg> hence why it works if you give all data types
[07:16:04] <tbranyen> hmmm can i unregister all existing transports?
[07:16:13] <jaubourg> $.ajaxTransport( "+*", yourTransport )
[07:16:21] <jaubourg> will put it BEFORE all existing catchall
[07:16:24] <tbranyen> boom, whats the + do?
[07:16:31] <tbranyen> move it to the top?
[07:16:46] <jaubourg> "+script" would put it before all script transports, etc
[07:17:00] <tbranyen> interesting, is that documented?
[07:17:05] <jaubourg> I dunno
[07:17:06] <tbranyen> like can i count on that always being a feature
[07:17:48] <jaubourg> if it's not documented, then it should, I think I thought about leaving it "hidden" in case I came with a better character/means, but we're well passed that now
[07:18:13] <tbranyen> yeah its def not documented in that section i linked
[07:18:22] <tbranyen> i scanned the shit out of it yesterday
[07:18:59] <jaubourg> thing is we should have some kind of tutorial for ajaxTransport... it's very difficult to document it properly
[07:19:21] <jaubourg> anyway, I don't see the "+" sign going anywhere
[07:19:22] <tbranyen> jaubourg: i'm working on a blog post
[07:19:26] <jaubourg> :)
[07:19:49] <tbranyen> specifically i'm doing it to show how to simulate ajax requests using the formal api instead of duck punching which is what i was doing
[07:19:55] <tbranyen> and how mockjax works
[07:20:02] <jaubourg> coolness
[07:23:02] <ben_alman> wat
[07:25:23] <jaubourg> wat wat
[07:25:25] <jaubourg> hi ben
[07:28:57] <ben_alman> hi jaubourg
[07:28:58] <ben_alman> how goes it
[07:37:52] <tbranyen> jaubourg: all my unit tests are passing now :D
[07:37:54] <tbranyen> so happy

[08:07:39] <jaubourg> lolbat is awesome, you really have to check the other strips
[08:33:26] <loris> Ajax calls : any idea why jqXHR.getAllResponseHeaders() would not return any custom headers ?
[19:02:37] <min|dvir|us> Hi. Where is .clean called, and what does it do?
[20:53:37] <danheberden> bot-t: tell min|dvir|us https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L440
