[00:52:53] <matjas> would be cool if e.g. `grunt custom:-deprecated` would also create a dist/jquery.min.js
[01:00:00] <matjas> IMHO having to run `grunt min` after creating a custom build is confusing
[01:00:43] <matjas> what if you run `grunt` then later run `grunt custom:-ajax` to create a custom build… there is a dist/jquery.min.js but it’s not the custom-built one
[05:22:20] <matjas> re: previous messages, I filed http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12059

[05:29:58] <gnarf> matjas: lemme see if i can hack that in
[05:30:51] <matjas> gnarf: yay! \o/ ideally `grunt build` would simply run the `min` task as well
[05:31:43] <matjas> OTOH dmethvin’s suggestion of adding module info to the banner for custom builds is not as straight-forward, probably
[05:34:46] <scott_gonzalez> matjas: You can look at what UI does for the banner.

[05:36:00] <jqcommit> [qunit/master] Bump post-release version - Jörn Zaefferer
[05:39:29] <DaveMethvin> matjas: even if the header just said CUSTOM BUILD I would be okay with that, but I foresee problems otherwise -- especially for minified custom builds
[05:39:56] <matjas> DaveMethvin: i agree it’s necessary to have the custom headers
[05:40:02] <matjas> just saying it may not be as easy a fix as the other thing
[05:40:11] <DaveMethvin> plus that's an excuse to build both files no matter what :)
[05:40:19] <matjas> listing out the modules that are included / excluded would be super useful
[05:40:55] <matjas> e.g. Modernizr spits out a link in the license comment that recreates the same build against the latest official version
[05:41:53] <matjas> if the jQuery license header could include the `grunt custom` parameters so they could just be copy pasted into `grunt custom:<paste>`, you’d win all the internets
[05:42:13] <matjas> easy updating of custom builds \o/
[05:42:38] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[05:43:24] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: did you see that bot message from Mike? About IE8 CSS?
[05:43:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that's great

[05:45:49] <DaveMethvin> wow, I dream it and gnarf does it! thanks!
[05:47:36] <matjas> while we were bickering about it, gnarf just got it done
[05:47:38] <matjas> hahah
[05:47:40] <matjas> nice work!
[05:48:40] <gnarf> eh - grunt is pretty awesome
[05:48:41] <gnarf> :)
[05:48:49] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: is Mike working on that?
[05:49:18] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: looks like there are effects regressions: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/229
[05:49:23] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: haven't talked to him yet but it seems he's on the trail
[05:49:57] <jzaefferer> one of these days...
[05:50:16] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: we get random fails in any timeout-based tests every once in a while
[05:50:27] <gnarf> the "all three still in queue" is prolly a timeout based failure
[05:50:33] <DaveMethvin> i have been trying to fix those by lengthening the timeouts
[05:50:41] <DaveMethvin> some of them are too tight, like 100ms
[05:50:52] <gnarf> jzaefferer: the other error is http://swarm.jquery.org/result/49764
[05:50:58] <DaveMethvin> and i think it fails when there is a hiccup in the swarm computers
[05:50:59] <gnarf> jzaefferer: in effects, that seems more qunit related :)
[05:51:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah that opera one i just was ignoring
[05:51:36] <DaveMethvin> maybe it will go away
[05:52:07] <jzaefferer> I wonder if the rerunning works
[05:52:09] <gnarf> jzaefferer: it is supposed to be capturing the exception - but it doesn't seem like it is...
[05:52:19] <jzaefferer> If its random, rerunning it should get rid of the failure
[05:52:30] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Can I close that core/UI ticket as invalid?
[05:53:02] <DaveMethvin> sure ... i'll add a note on the blog post that users will need a UI update
[05:56:45] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: have you tested this opera bug?
[05:57:14] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i didn't see it in earlier runs, is it consistent?
[05:59:58] <DaveMethvin> i don't have opera 11.62 locally but it seems to work fine on 12  ... let me try browserstack

[06:02:05] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by Corey Frang (21.003s ago): Adresses @mathiasbynens comment from last commit - version format is now pastable to grunt custom:
[06:02:49] <matjas> gnarf: ♥
[06:03:02] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i can't repro it
[06:03:13] <gnarf> it seems like it was a weird timing issue thing
[06:03:36] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: yep, didn't repro here on browserstack
[06:03:45] <gnarf> i think i know what the issue is
[06:04:19] <gnarf> the "fxNow" unseting timeout isn't being called before the one queued after it - its the only case I could think that this bug would show up
[06:04:36] <DaveMethvin> hmm, is there a place where users can get a prebuilt jquery ui master?
[06:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> http://code.jquery.com/ui/jquery-ui-git.js
[06:05:41] <scott_gonzalez> silly DaveMethvin
[06:05:53] <scott_gonzalez> There's no pre-built 1-8-stable though.
[06:06:21] <DaveMethvin> right that's what i was asking, like if someone wants to test ui 1.8
[06:06:48] <DaveMethvin> but yes it's not master
[06:07:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do we want one?
[06:07:32] <DaveMethvin> it's for the blog post, i wanted to tell people they could include a newer patched ui but they probably don't want to jump to 1.9 do they?
[06:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, they do.
[06:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well...
[06:07:56] <DaveMethvin> lol
[06:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> It depends what version of jQuery they're using.
[06:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> Nevermind, that's dumb. They're obviously using 1.8 :-P
[06:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> They should use UI 1.9.
[06:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's fully back compat.
[06:08:45] <DaveMethvin> okay so I'll point them to the -git one
[06:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[06:09:06] <gnarf> if you are using core beta 1.8, try out UI beta 1.9 too!
[06:09:12] <gnarf> just go all beta
[06:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> Might be worth mentioning in your blog post that UI will release 1.8.x with jQuery 1.8 support, but users are encouraged to upgrade to jQuery UI 1.9.
[06:10:15] <scott_gonzalez> There are people using 1.9.0-beta.1 in production :-)
[06:10:47] <scott_gonzalez> Amazingly, I don't think we've received a single bug against 1.9.0-beta.1 and we've had reports that replacing 1.8.x worked just fine.
[06:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> We'll see if that continues when we get to a stable release.

[07:09:41] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: nice detective work btw
[07:12:09] <mikesherov> :-)
[07:12:47] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: it's stupid, I tested 100 combinations
[07:12:59] <mikesherov> ONLY font-size:13px on the body causes that
[07:13:11] <mikesherov> Like literally, each parameter of that matters
[07:13:18] <mikesherov> font-size anything else works just fine
[07:13:29] <mikesherov> font-size:13px on a different selector, fine
[07:13:42] <mikesherov> other css properties, fine
[07:13:51] <DaveMethvin> so bizarre
[07:14:15] <mikesherov> and there is nothing on the net about IE8 font-size messing with an iframe as far as I can tell
[07:14:52] <mikesherov> I think there might be a bug in jQuery here that makes some assumptions about body, but no one has ever reported it...

[10:59:19] <jzaefferer> who are you?
[11:00:23] <DaveMethvin> your jedi mind tricks don't work on me
[11:00:42] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez:  the whole custom event idea for onbeforeunload in core was a bad idea because we don't abstract it, and it only applies to window. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L560
[11:00:57] <DaveMethvin> so now that we've stepped halfway in, i suppose we need to chain them too ... ugh
[11:01:06] <DaveMethvin> we don't do that for ANY OTHER native event
[11:01:24] <scott_gonzalez> FIX IT!
[11:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> Did you see my comment in the other ticket?
[11:01:49] <scott_gonzalez> Where I said no?
[11:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...
[11:03:04] <DaveMethvin> the problem is that inline handlers is the only way to use onbeforeunload?
[11:03:08] <DaveMethvin> at least on several browsers?
[11:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> I think so.
[11:03:24] <DaveMethvin> i'll be in my room, crying
[11:03:35] <scott_gonzalez> We don't actually care about that in UI, we just need a way to do something right before the page unloads.
[11:04:18] <DaveMethvin> sounds like a great application for onbeforeunload :D
[11:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, too bad it's totally busted :-/
[11:05:19] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, and the problem is that it's not a normal event, in that it returns a STRING rather than true/false
[11:05:32] <DaveMethvin> so our normal event plumbing would be flummoxed anyway
[11:05:40] <DaveMethvin> just like window.onerror
[11:06:12] <scott_gonzalez> Who designs this crap?
[11:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[11:06:19] <DaveMethvin> designs?

[12:00:10] <gibson042> I think so; I'll claim it now
[12:01:00] <gibson042> I think my latest Sizzle pull fixes that
[12:02:48] <gibson042> hrm; or not
[12:06:29] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[12:11:40] <gibson042> got a fix, PR against sizzle forthcoming
[12:14:45] <FJ> anybody here?

[12:17:30] <FJ> perfect :-)
[12:18:47] <FJ> http://jsfiddle.net/FlasJunior/vLHJF/ with jQuery 1.8 / git version has an error. With jQuery 1.7.2 it works http://jsfiddle.net/FlasJunior/vLHJF/1 . is this a jQuery Problem or jsTree?
[12:19:16] <FJ> error is: jquery-git.js (4094)
[12:19:16] <FJ> elem.getAttribute is not a function
[12:19:16] <FJ> return pattern.test( elem.className || elem.getAttribute("class") || "" );
[12:21:35] <ajpiano> it's JStree being a little silly
[12:21:40] <ajpiano> coupled with recent changes to sizzle
[12:21:54] <ajpiano> where we get a bit stricter about input
[12:22:04] <ajpiano> what's happening is that jstree is doing $(-1).is(".jstree")
[12:22:04] <ajpiano> :|
[12:22:23] <FJ> i can remove the input fields.. i have the same problems.
[12:22:25] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/3126131R0R2i0c1b3Y0F
[12:22:37] <ajpiano> FJ: no i mean input to $( )
[12:22:43] <FJ> a, sorry.
[12:23:02] <ajpiano> FJ:  earlier today the lads were discussing problems with $(document).is("whatever") being broken in the 1.8 betas
[12:23:14] <ajpiano> but i suspect we might be a little less forgiving about $(integer).is("whatever") :p[
[12:23:32] <FJ> so i don't add this to the bugtracker, right?
[12:23:33] <danheberden> $(4).is(':even') doesn't work
[12:23:40] <danheberden> PLEASE FIX THIS BUG
[12:24:16] <ajpiano> i would still say that this is somehow related to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12054
[12:24:56] <ajpiano> cause yes, "jQuery wasn't erroring out before" but also $(-1) is a crazy thing to pass to jQuery
[12:25:10] <ajpiano> JSTree should definitely be doing its check in the opposite order
[12:27:24] <FJ> i made an issue @ jstree git repo.
[12:28:35] <FJ> if you like to write there something: https://github.com/vakata/jstree/issues/242 that could help me

[12:35:30] <scott_gonzalez> I agree, $( document/window ).is( whatever ) should be valid input.
[12:35:39] <scott_gonzalez> $( -1 ).is( whatever ) should not be valid.
[12:36:51] <FJ> i hate jstree anyway :-) my problem is that this is the only thing why i can't update our intranet to 1.8 :-/

[12:38:39] <ajpiano> FJ if you just hack your copy of JSTree to reverse the order of that check you'll probably be ok
[12:39:05] <FJ> i shoud remove that crappy jstree and build an owne with html5 like http://farhadi.ir/projects/html5sortable/

[12:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather not introduce that complexity until we solve a lot of other issues.
[12:41:18] <FJ> i think i'll use https://github.com/dbushell/Nestable for basic trees.

[12:48:39] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on sizzle by gibson042 ( ago): Fix jQuery #12057: accept numbers as unquoted attribute values
[12:49:12] <DaveMethvin> ah thanks gibson042
[12:49:37] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: this one has me a bit worried http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12054
[12:49:41] <gibson042> also, we have a quasi-regression of #10791
[12:50:24] <gibson042> it's visible if you check the noqsa box, which means it will manifest in any browser that understands SVG but doesn't have qsA
[12:50:34] <DaveMethvin> well I STILL HATE SVG
[12:50:41] <gibson042> I don't know if that's an empty set or not
[12:51:11] <DaveMethvin> hmm, svg but not qsa, that would be ie6/7
[12:51:21] <gibson042> I'm inclined to say we just go back and wontfix it; [class=foo] is a perfectly viable workaround
[12:51:37] <gibson042> no; I didn't see it there because their SVG support is lacking
[12:51:54] <DaveMethvin> lacking? you don't say!
[12:51:59] <gibson042> :O
[12:52:35] <DaveMethvin> 12054 looks pretty fixable but concerns me b/c people are passing crap like $(-1).is(".class") to us
[12:52:41] <gibson042> but I just don't like having the test in there if we're not committing to support it
[12:52:53] <gibson042> mmm, right
[12:53:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah i see your point, and i still hate svg so that's something
[12:53:43] <DaveMethvin> i will reopen 10791 and we can decide whether it can be fixed, i'd say the workaround is fine
[12:53:59] <gibson042> JQUERY Y U NO $(-1)
[12:54:27] <DaveMethvin> and of course it makes a bunch of plugins blow up
[12:54:32] <DaveMethvin> so it has to be a bug in 1.8
[12:54:55] <DaveMethvin> lol @  danheberden: $(4).is(':even') doesn't work
[12:55:16] <gibson042> also, how come jQuery(true).is(true) === false
[12:55:21] <gibson042> FIX IT FIX IT FIX IT
[12:55:24] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:55:38] <DaveMethvin> i mean clearly it's true
[12:55:47] <gibson042> that's what I'm sayin'!
[12:56:01] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: THEN MAKE IT WORK
[12:56:07] <danheberden> you're the jQuery expert
[12:56:07] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: great communication and handling of the 2.0 1.9 news
[12:56:20] <danheberden> christ, how will i ever know if a number is even or not?!
[12:56:45] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: hoo boy, never underestimate the reading comprehension of people
[12:56:58] <DaveMethvin> but i think it will be okay
[12:57:11] <DaveMethvin> and if not well screw them, we'll be having too much fun writing 2.0
[12:57:13] <paul_irish> yah :)
[12:58:07] <paul_irish> i made a post that explained IE's update policy. and was as fair as possible (which, in reality, means i gave IE too much credit) and thus people celebrated the thing that i was actually explaining was incomplete and weak
[12:58:48] <paul_irish> cant bury the lede. or even write a headline that is balanced.
[13:00:44] <DaveMethvin> amen bro
[13:03:29] <DaveMethvin> so gibson042 you'll pul that test for #10791? I'm marking the old ticket open for now
[13:04:22] <gibson042> just take it out, right?
[13:04:26] <gibson042> sure
[13:04:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah

[13:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Do you know how much SSL certs cost? And whether we'd need them for anything other than code.jquery.com?
[13:53:46] <gnarf> gibson042: window and document should be valid for that call
[13:54:09] <gibson042> right, that's what's being tested
[13:54:37] <gibson042> they won't have the class (because they don't have any), but Sizzle shouldn't blow up trying to call getAttribute on them
[13:54:47] <gnarf> yes
[13:57:22] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez ~$30
[13:57:54] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's cheap. I always thought they were kind of expensive.
[13:58:51] <danheberden> they have different ratings, though code.jquery.com doesn't need anything special accept to get an 'ok'
[13:59:24] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: http://danheberden.com/share/b6ce.png
[14:00:36] <danheberden> though the $91 one would be a value if we wanted to do all of jquery.com and allow code/static/whateverelse
[14:00:57] <danheberden> but we really only need code.jquery.com

[14:26:47] <DaveMethvin> wow, what a strange sequence of events
[14:27:39] <gnarf> should we be suggesting class =
[14:27:50] <gnarf> dont we have the one ~= or whatever that matches a "word" ?
[14:28:04] <gibson042> yes; you're right
[14:28:12] <gibson042> I was way too hasty with that
[14:29:55] <gnarf> also - that feels like its going to be a slap in the face, but i don't even know what an svg element is - so I don't care

[14:42:14] <gibson042> cleanup of the cleanup
[14:42:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah no problem
[14:43:01] <DaveMethvin> took me an hour, my sizzle was ancient and then i forgot to pull before my own merge/push and it had me confused as heck
[14:43:35] <gibson042> looks like it straightened out, though
[14:44:05] <DaveMethvin> yay, no regressions! http://swarm.jquery.org/job/237
[14:44:46] <DaveMethvin> just the IE8 issues, i think mikesherov has those figured out, and i've seen that event prob with async before
[14:44:53] <DaveMethvin> it comes and goes
[14:45:04] <DaveMethvin> as do the ones with event and ajax due to timing
[14:45:06] <gibson042> yeah, I saw that
[14:45:10] <gibson042> big kudos to him
[14:45:18] <DaveMethvin> i think we just need to lengthen the timeouts for the random fails
[14:45:19] <mikesherov> just took tenacity :-)
[14:45:30] <gibson042> ^5
[14:48:05] <gibson042> also, to revisit another old ticket, http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10762 (`.on("event", "> child delegation", handler)`) looks like it can be had for 12 bytes min+gzip... any thoughts?
[14:49:54] <DaveMethvin> well that's tempting gibson042

[15:59:36] <shoky> seems much better now though, loading pages at least
[16:14:45] <gnarf> okay

[16:29:23] <gnarf> i think i might of found a culprit
[16:41:43] <gnarf> well - i'll keep monitoring - see if this change makes an appreciable difference
[16:42:09] <gnarf> overnight tonight I'm probably going to take down bugs for a few hours and see if I can't spring a stage for a new trac too

[20:47:23] <alcuadrado> Hi, I've found a bug in firefox implementation of String.prototype.trim which is affecting jquery (at leaste in parseJson). Of course I'll file it in mozilla's bugzilla, but I fill that I should also report it to you (so jquery isn't affected by it). I'm right? Sorry if this is not the right place
[21:05:27] <ajpiano> alcuadrado: in a pre-release version of ff?
[21:06:16] <ajpiano> alcuadrado: you can file it for us, too, i'd say
[21:06:20] <alcuadrado> the stable one
[21:06:27] <ajpiano> cause we're trimming whitespace before we check whether we can use a native parser
[21:06:41] <ajpiano> which at my first glance seems odd to me
[21:06:45] <alcuadrado> yeah, that's why I thought it would be important to you
[21:06:57] <ajpiano> can you file it with like, a view of that
[21:07:14] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L492 says that the trim only has to happen for oldIE
[21:08:53] <alcuadrado> sure, I'm filing it at mozilla at the moment, then I'll do that
[21:09:38] <ajpiano> alcuadrado: thanks
[21:10:20] <alcuadrado> thanks to you for your great work at jq
[21:13:18] <snover> i am very curious how moz managed to fuck up trim
[21:16:24] <alcuadrado> it seems to be a bug in the rope implementation
[21:16:30] <alcuadrado> "\\n".trim() === "n" gives true
[21:16:35] <alcuadrado> but not always :(
