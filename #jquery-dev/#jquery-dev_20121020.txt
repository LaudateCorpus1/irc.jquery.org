[07:09:59] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix #12610, remove unneeded window.event. Close gh-968. - Sai Wong
[07:27:21] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #443: FAILURE in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/443/
[07:27:21] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Fix #12610, remove unneeded window.event. Close gh-968.
[09:24:44] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yt?
[09:24:56] <DaveMethvin> yep mikesherov
[09:25:06] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I'm trying to accomplish this authors task that you evilly assigned to me
[09:25:18] <DaveMethvin> feel free to punt :D
[09:25:25] <mikesherov> I can do the part with adding to authors.txt by just using `grunt authors`
[09:25:37] <mikesherov> But just need to know how to do it
[09:25:40] <DaveMethvin> well...not really
[09:25:49] <mikesherov> Meaning, do they need to sign the CLA first?
[09:25:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah they  need to sign the cla
[09:26:02] <mikesherov> BEFORE
[09:26:03] <DaveMethvin> we could do it in either order
[09:26:12] <DaveMethvin> but we need to be sure it's not a dup
[09:26:20] <mikesherov> yeah, dupes I got covered
[09:26:34] <DaveMethvin> i am just using the grunt authors as a check
[09:26:37] <mikesherov> but do I then need to edit history?
[09:26:42] <DaveMethvin> and then editing AUTHORS.txt manually
[09:26:53] <mikesherov> Right, that's what I'm doing...
[09:27:03] <DaveMethvin> no if they had the name wrong and it was committed, we just need to update authors.txt
[09:27:13] <DaveMethvin> and ask them to set their git info right
[09:27:15] <DaveMethvin> for the future
[09:27:18] <mikesherov> for example: Daniel Galvez <dgalvez@editablething.com> has a commit
[09:27:33] <mikesherov> but then, so does Daniel Gàlvez <dgalvez@editablething.com>
[09:27:37] <mikesherov> notice the utf8
[09:27:39] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:27:45] <mikesherov> so I add both?
[09:27:49] <DaveMethvin> no  just one
[09:28:02] <mikesherov> Right, so Daniel Galvez was already merged in
[09:28:08] <DaveMethvin> you just have to manually de-dup, and  yeah he's added already
[09:28:22] <mikesherov> right, so then do I amend the commits from him?
[09:28:33] <DaveMethvin> i don't think you can?
[09:28:36] <DaveMethvin> and i wasn't
[09:28:45] <mikesherov> so that the next run of `grunt authors` doesn't re catch him
[09:29:05] <DaveMethvin> grunt authors is just a blunt tool, it's not authoritative
[09:29:13] <mikesherov> right, but for our sanity
[09:29:17] <DaveMethvin> AUTHORS.txt is authoritative
[09:29:21] <mikesherov> right
[09:29:23] <mikesherov> I get that
[09:29:27] <mikesherov> let me give a use case
[09:29:31] <DaveMethvin> you mean, edit a commit in the history from last week/month?
[09:29:38] <mikesherov> so I see this guy is a dupe
[09:29:46] <mikesherov> and so I merge in his commit
[09:30:00] <mikesherov> but don't add to authors.txt because he's already there
[09:30:20] <mikesherov> next time I run `grunt authors` his dupe will be listed there again
[09:30:31] <mikesherov> and I'll have to remember that I did that already
[09:31:35] <DaveMethvin> right ... not sure how to avoid that
[09:31:46] <mikesherov> what `grunt authors` should do is parse out the email addys of contributors, and compare against the email addys in authors.txt
[09:31:54] <mikesherov> that handles that
[09:32:05] <DaveMethvin> ideally, but it would need to know which mistakes were dups
[09:32:08] <DaveMethvin> including changed emails etc
[09:32:17] <mikesherov> which mistakes?
[09:32:33] <DaveMethvin> like when someone used an email 6 months ago but changed to a new one
[09:32:37] <mikesherov> oh, right
[09:32:46] <DaveMethvin> we'd want to update the email
[09:32:52] <mikesherov> sure
[09:32:53] <DaveMethvin> but we won't change the old commits
[09:33:00] <DaveMethvin> from 6 months ago
[09:33:02] <mikesherov> so that's separate, and I have a way to tackle that
[09:33:08] <DaveMethvin> oh good!
[09:33:17] <mikesherov> it's by changing the old commits
[09:33:23] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[09:33:38] <DaveMethvin> first, i didn't even know you could amend anything but head
[09:33:39] <gnarf> changing?
[09:33:48] <DaveMethvin> second, i am not sure it's a good idea
[09:33:53] <mikesherov> agreed
[09:33:57] <mikesherov> it may not be
[09:34:01] <gnarf> terribad idea
[09:34:04] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[09:34:11] <mikesherov> but that's a way to tackle it :-)
[09:34:12] <gnarf> better would be extending grunt authors
[09:34:14] <gnarf> to have a "map"
[09:34:18] <mikesherov> gnarf, yes
[09:34:24] <mikesherov> sure
[09:34:26] <gnarf> so you can say "this dude sucks and has 5 emails"
[09:34:32] <mikesherov> right
[09:34:41] <mikesherov> step 1 is compare emails
[09:35:23] <DaveMethvin> i had a little hacky node program that did this so I could tell who responded
[09:35:35] <DaveMethvin> compared names and emails and let me know if the name or email changed
[09:35:52] <mikesherov> believe it or not, both dupes based off latest run are name changes
[09:35:55] <mikesherov> not email changes
[09:36:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah, accents and sometimes initials
[09:36:15] <mikesherov> right
[09:36:18] <mikesherov> and middle names
[09:36:24] <mikesherov> so grunt authors should check emails
[09:36:33] <DaveMethvin> in the CLA people tend to give their formal names rather than nicknames
[09:36:38] <mikesherov> right
[09:37:05] <DaveMethvin> i dont' care if they use their common names like Ben for Benjamin or whatever as long as they sign the CLA
[09:37:37] <DaveMethvin> so you should have access to the spreadsheet now, you can see what we have
[09:37:43] <mikesherov> grunt authors should parse authors.txt and get out emails, then compare against emails from it's current output, and note the differences
[09:37:52] <DaveMethvin> and then the CAA, we'll need to add those in as well somehow
[09:38:09] <mikesherov> that's a good first step
[09:38:13] <DaveMethvin> this seems like bookkeeping junk, i am not sure it needs to be in the project itself
[09:38:21] <mikesherov> well, grunt authors is
[09:38:28] <mikesherov> and it's a useful tool for committers
[09:38:31] <DaveMethvin> like old emails, spelling mistakes, CLA vs CAA
[09:38:35] <mikesherov> and scott will need it
[09:38:38] <mikesherov> and mobile will need it
[09:38:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah i know, and there's no other place to put it
[09:38:50] <mikesherov> so I think it belongs in the project
[09:38:53] <DaveMethvin> true it shoudl be in a common repo
[09:38:58] <DaveMethvin> not in each project's repo
[09:39:01] <mikesherov> right
[09:39:05] <DaveMethvin> we share authors
[09:39:21] <mikesherov> jquery/jquery-tools
[09:39:26] <DaveMethvin> for that matter it could go in a private repo
[09:39:32] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yes
[09:39:50] <mikesherov> like a committers toolset
[09:39:56] <DaveMethvin> if you have a plan that would be awesome
[09:40:01] <DaveMethvin> or even an inkling of a hint of a plan
[09:40:18] <mikesherov> Here's the plan: gnarf, make a private repo, call it whatever
[09:40:29] <mikesherov> actually
[09:40:41] <mikesherov> yeah, and make it a submodule of each project
[09:40:50] <mikesherov> not sure it needs to be private
[09:40:50] <DaveMethvin> technically you should be able to pull that spreadsheet via curl or whatever
[09:41:00] <mikesherov> spreadsheet!?
[09:41:12] <DaveMethvin> the one i just shared, you should have gotten an email
[09:41:18] <DaveMethvin> it is the list of ppl who signed the CLA
[09:41:31] <DaveMethvin> which you might need
[09:42:15] <mikesherov> I see, so `grunt authors`, imagining the perfect tool, is:
[09:42:22] <gnarf> could we use github.jquery.com
[09:42:34] <gnarf> like /authorMap.json ?
[09:42:39] <DaveMethvin> it's private so yeah
[09:44:22] <DaveMethvin> the perfect tool would look at the pull queue, ask any new contribs to sign the CLA, add a note to the pull that they were signers, warn contribs if their git info wasn't "Firstname Lastname <myemail@wherever.com>", notify them that will be public in AUTHORS.txt, etc
[09:44:41] <DaveMethvin> oh and cook me some bacon
[09:45:02] <DaveMethvin> i am willing to settle for much less than perfection for now tho
[09:45:05] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: so this would be a mergeatron task
[09:45:18] <mikesherov> gnarf: ^
[09:45:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah from the way you described that tool
[09:45:44] <mikesherov> like, when you submit pull, are already a signed contributor
[09:45:47] <DaveMethvin> adding the style checks, botio,, et
[09:45:48] <DaveMethvin> c
[09:46:23] <mikesherov> and it would comment on the pull if they aren't already in authors.txt with something like "Hey, sign this CLA!"
[09:46:50] <mikesherov> or in authorsMap.json (or whatever we call it)
[09:46:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:47:13] <mikesherov> cool
[09:47:16] <DaveMethvin> that would be fully awesome
[09:47:23] <gnarf> seems very cool
[09:47:41] <mikesherov> and it would use github status API to warn us not to merge until they sign the CLA
[09:48:06] <DaveMethvin> love it
[09:48:07] <gnarf> also seems like it's remarkably more work than just manually updating AUTHORS when you land a pull for now (of course, like maybe 30 manual updates will be > than the implementation effort)
[09:48:17] <DaveMethvin> i agree with that
[09:48:22] <DaveMethvin> don't want this to be a blocker
[09:48:25] <mikesherov> sure
[09:48:26] <mikesherov> I agree
[09:48:36] <gnarf> its a "bucket list" task for sure
[09:48:38] <DaveMethvin> the reason this became more work was the Summit
[09:48:42] <DaveMethvin> lots of new contribs
[09:48:45] <mikesherov> well, sure
[09:48:46] <DaveMethvin> which is good news
[09:48:57] <mikesherov> but if mergeatron is a thing we're after anyway
[09:49:01] <mikesherov> which I think we are
[09:49:04] <gnarf> shit that would be good to do when we can, but like surely there are more higher priority uses of a sherov's time
[09:49:06] <mikesherov> it's trivial after that
[09:49:26] <DaveMethvin> it shouldn't be too bad to do these manually for now, but i LOVE the idea of having the pull request process take care of all this for us
[09:49:27] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: when's the next dev leads meeting? this upcoming week, or next?
[09:49:28] <DaveMethvin> automation ftw
[09:49:29] <mikesherov> grunt authors is 90% of the way there
[09:49:43] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: it was last week
[09:49:47] <gnarf> k
[09:49:58] <DaveMethvin> there's always -devs-team
[09:50:05] <gnarf> i wanna invite mike there to talk about mergatron if he can make it
[09:50:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:50:20] <DaveMethvin> we need more shared tools
[09:51:06] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov now that you've seen lots of ui processes you are in a good position to see common tasks we could tackle like this
[09:51:23] <DaveMethvin> we should definitely avoid duplicate efforts
[09:51:32] <mikesherov> yes
[09:51:36] <mikesherov> for example, ui hasn
[09:51:37] <mikesherov> '
[09:51:41] <mikesherov> like tirage
[09:51:47] <DaveMethvin> which reminds me i wanted to ask about ui using AMD for modularity as well
[09:52:02] <DaveMethvin> maybe we can create a common tool for that
[09:52:12] <mikesherov> yes
[09:52:40] <gnarf> gseguin made the amd builder for mobile
[09:53:16] <DaveMethvin> gotta go for about an hour, but i plan to come back and land some more PRs this afternoon
[09:54:23] <mikesherov> k
[10:46:34] <jqcommit> [jquery] mikesherov pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Mrss6Q
[10:46:34] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] adding awesome new contributors to AUTHORS.txt - Mike Sherov
[10:47:50] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: sent you email with people who need to be added as contributors
[10:47:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah got it
[10:47:59] <DaveMethvin> i can ping them
[10:48:02] <mikesherov> thanks
[10:48:10] <DaveMethvin> were those all from the summit mikesherov
[10:48:14] <mikesherov> yes
[10:48:24] <DaveMethvin> ok
[10:48:41] <mikesherov> morgan, ish, and Akintayo were specifically at my table
[10:49:01] <mikesherov> next summit, make signing of the CLA as prereq for attendance
[10:49:05] <DaveMethvin> I'll ask for their full names
[10:49:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah we could do that
[10:49:15] <mikesherov> morgan is Dan Morgan
[10:49:26] <mikesherov> but anyway, you'll get that info :-)
[10:49:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah and Ish seems pretty clear from the email :D
[10:49:54] <mikesherov> ha
[10:50:02] <DaveMethvin> but we'll either need your magical map or they'll need to set their git info right
[10:50:09] <mikesherov> magic map for the win
[10:50:35] <mikesherov> why trust humans when you can trust magic computers
[10:50:41] <DaveMethvin> since their git info is what shows up in the log, it would be great to have that be correct too
[10:50:53] <DaveMethvin> otherwise we have to fix it manually or leave it "wrong"
[10:50:58] <mikesherov> well, mergeatron
[10:51:04] <mikesherov> and magic map
[10:51:10] <mikesherov> that plugs the leak
[10:51:17] <mikesherov> but no way to mop the floor
[10:51:26] <DaveMethvin> right we should only have to manually change it once
[10:51:37] <DaveMethvin> and then have mergy yell at them
[10:51:52] <mikesherov> well, if you and gnarf weren't such sissies about CHANGING PUBLISH HISTORY
[10:51:57] <mikesherov> :-P
[10:52:16] <DaveMethvin> hey this ain't Back to the Future, McFly!
[10:52:37] <mikesherov> just to be clear, I think author changing doesn't change the SHA
[10:52:55] <mikesherov> but I'm not positive
[10:53:20] <mikesherov> no, I'm wrong
[10:53:21] <mikesherov> nvm
[10:53:23] <DaveMethvin> tbh i did'n't even know you could edit that in any form once it was not the head
[10:53:33] <mikesherov> well, what do you think a rebase is?
[10:53:42] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[10:53:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah but that changes the sha?
[10:53:53] <mikesherov> yes
[10:54:04] <mikesherov> and that's why you have to push origin --force
[10:54:17] <DaveMethvin> right unless you haven't pushed
[10:54:20] <mikesherov> to tell git you're absolutely positive you want to overwrite pushed history
[10:54:22] <DaveMethvin> which i do all the time
[10:54:25] <mikesherov> right
[10:54:30] <mikesherov> edit local history all you want
[10:54:41] <mikesherov> but be damn sure when you want to push those history changes
[10:54:45] <DaveMethvin> it's only history once you push, otherwise it's the present
[10:54:50] <mikesherov> right
[10:54:53] <DaveMethvin> there's no time like the present
[10:55:02] <mikesherov> which is safe on pull requests because no one is relying on that history
[10:55:28] <mikesherov> but author changes do change SHA's, so it's a no go
[10:55:35] <mikesherov> unless we want Biff running the place
[10:55:48] <DaveMethvin> THINK McMike!
[10:56:03] <mikesherov> ha
[10:56:25] <mikesherov> ok, I'm landing this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/958
[10:56:26] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by fracmak (5d, 2h ago): Fixes Ticket #12518
[10:56:37] <mikesherov> best pull request description ever
[10:56:57] <DaveMethvin> do it!
[11:02:48] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #444: STILL FAILING in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/444/
[11:02:49] <doesallmagic> mike.sherov: adding awesome new contributors to AUTHORS.txt
[11:03:34] <DaveMethvin> damn, back to random fails the last two tests
[11:04:17] <jqcommit> [jquery] mikesherov pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/CPAjmQ
[11:04:17] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fixes #12518, removes an offsetWidth on focus/blur events for an <IE9 bug that caused a performance hit. Closes gh-958 - Merrifield, Jay
[11:05:30] <mikesherov> DavMethvin: what's with the "speed" directory
[11:18:04] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: that's timmy's perf tests
[11:18:21] <mikesherov> really?
[11:18:32] <mikesherov> didn't he update them to make them look great?
[11:19:13] <mikesherov> http://localhost:8888/jquery/src/sizzle/speed/ is that
[11:19:17] <DaveMethvin> oh no those aren't the ones
[11:19:18] <DaveMethvin> sorry
[11:19:31] <mikesherov> I'm talking about http://localhost:8888/jquery/speed/
[11:19:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[11:19:40] <DaveMethvin> that's really old
[11:19:47] <mikesherov> they still work
[11:19:50] <DaveMethvin> those are circa 2008
[11:19:53] <DaveMethvin> "work"
[11:19:56] <mikesherov> is there any use in keeping them around?
[11:20:17] <DaveMethvin> as a shameful reminder we need updated perf tests? :D
[11:20:32] <mikesherov> like jquery-basis.js can just be pulled from CDN
[11:20:40] <mikesherov> rather than keeping a copy of jq1.4.2 around
[11:21:01] <DaveMethvin> i don't think any of that stuff is very representative
[11:21:11] <DaveMethvin> but we do need some basic perf tests to avoid regressions
[11:21:13] <mikesherov> I agree
[11:21:23] <mikesherov> the sizzle one is awesome
[11:21:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's timmy's
[11:21:29] <mikesherov> I was thinking base it off of that
[11:21:46] <mikesherov> remove John's old benchmark code
[11:21:47] <DaveMethvin> we need something more representative than the old /speed stuff
[11:21:49] <mikesherov> and use benchmark.js
[11:21:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[11:22:00] <mikesherov> Sure, the question is refactor vs. rewrite
[11:22:02] <DaveMethvin> that was actually from something called slickspeed
[11:22:17] <mikesherov> I'm tempted to just delete the directory and start fresh
[11:22:23] <DaveMethvin> i don't know if any of that can be salvaged
[11:22:25] <DaveMethvin> so yeah
[11:22:35] <mikesherov> But what would be nice would be a jsperf style thing
[11:22:42] <mikesherov> where you put in one piece of code
[11:22:58] <mikesherov> and it runs your local against last release
[11:23:18] <mikesherov> but that's another discussion
[11:23:38] <mikesherov> I want to put in a ticket for nuke and rethink perf tests
[11:23:44] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[11:23:45] <mikesherov> and the first step is nuke
[11:23:52] <DaveMethvin> perhaps as a topic for monday?
[11:23:56] <mikesherov> great
[11:24:00] <mikesherov> good idea
[11:26:07] <mikesherov> so fracmak was a contributor about 20 months ago too
[11:26:12] <mikesherov> he's not really "new"
[11:26:20] <DaveMethvin> oh really
[11:26:23] <DaveMethvin> well he's good
[11:26:49] <mikesherov> yeah, 3 pulls at the summit
[11:27:02] <mikesherov> he's on line 72 of the jqueryUI authors file
[11:27:13] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[11:27:14] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #445: FIXED in 22 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/445/
[11:27:14] <doesallmagic> mike.sherov: Fixes #12518, removes an offsetWidth on focus/blur events for an <IE9 bug that caused a performance hit. Closes gh-958
[11:32:08] <DaveMethvin> okay, emails sent
[11:35:47] <mikesherov> thanks!
[11:39:45] <gnarf> mikesherov: changing history breaks peoples clones --- all the time
[11:39:55] <mikesherov> yes
[11:39:57] <gnarf> because then they have to force pull
