[11:08:38] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: yessir
[12:05:38] <DaveMethvin> sorry paul_irish, you still there?
[12:05:45] <paul_irish> yup
[12:05:52] <DaveMethvin> woohoo!
[12:05:53] <DaveMethvin> ok
[12:06:02] <DaveMethvin> i just wanted to verify about sourcemaps
[12:06:23] <DaveMethvin> i'm going to assume that all three files (map, uncompressed, and compressed) are in the same folder
[12:06:32] <DaveMethvin> since the map needs to specify that path
[12:06:46] <DaveMethvin> so when i deliver them it will assume that
[12:19:24] <paul_irish> they don't need to be in the same folder
[12:19:34] <paul_irish> could be in 3 separate ones
[12:19:45] <DaveMethvin> right, but we need to agree on where they will go :D
[12:19:48] <paul_irish> yes
[12:19:58] <DaveMethvin> i'm good with something simple
[12:20:01] <paul_irish> same
[12:20:19] <DaveMethvin> if it gets complicated i just know people will get it wrong
[12:20:30] <DaveMethvin> there's a bug in uglify2 atm that adds the path
[12:20:39] <DaveMethvin> so i have to remove it
[12:21:50] <DaveMethvin> if you were doing something with custom builds it might make sense to have fancy relative paths there, but for the CDN case i don't think so
[12:22:31] <DaveMethvin> btw paul_irish, using source maps is awesome
[12:22:50] <paul_irish> yeah! :D

[13:39:10] <DaveMethvin> oh swarmy, jQuery 2.0 can't come soon enough
[13:39:27] <DaveMethvin> what are you gonna do when you can't bitch about that one little pixel in IE8?
[13:40:12] <DaveMethvin> no IE8 users on the face of the planet care about a pixel
[13:40:20] <DaveMethvin> if they did, they wouldn't be using IE8
[13:40:33] <DaveMethvin> it's like eating caviar off a paper plate

[15:01:45] <snover> DaveMethvin: want a new test stack? :)
[15:02:07] <DaveMethvin> depends, snover, can santa fit it in the chimney?
[15:02:22] <snover> it would have to be a metaphorical chimney
[15:04:03] <DaveMethvin> i'm just spending all day dealing with issues having to do with the test environment, rather than the code itself
[15:04:39] <snover> i hope to have something useful within the next week
[15:05:04] <DaveMethvin> i'll be looking in my metaphorical chimney
