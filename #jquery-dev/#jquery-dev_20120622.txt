[07:18:33] <timmywil> .
[07:18:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: need anything before release?
[07:19:11] <DaveMethvin> i think we're pretty good
[07:19:17] <timmywil> kk
[07:19:17] <DaveMethvin> i have one ie6/7 mem leak i'm fixing
[07:19:40] <DaveMethvin> anything you'd like to add about sizzzle on the blog post timmywil?
[07:19:45] <DaveMethvin> i don't have a section for it atm
[07:19:56] <timmywil> sure!
[07:20:09] <timmywil> I can do a little summary
[07:20:11] <DaveMethvin> i think you have write access on the doc so you can just add it in if you want
[07:22:32] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I think I missed the link
[07:22:41] <rwaldron> What was the final word on this https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commit/d6ea222b4a9cccb9eb4dd3a717129a528c2cb525
[07:22:42] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by timmywil (17h, 11m ago): Throw an error when the context passed to jQuery.parseHTML is not a document.
[07:22:47] <rwaldron> (sorry I missed that yesterday)
[07:23:16] <timmywil> rwaldron: we were leaning towards skipping it for now. what do you think?
[07:23:36] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: nvm, i got it
[07:23:55] <DaveMethvin> i'd say skip the document check, it should be a document
[07:25:08] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ok, I thought I had it. sry, link please
[07:25:30] <DaveMethvin> should be in your gmail now
[07:25:59] <rwaldron> timmywil I support skipping this
[07:27:34] <DaveMethvin> yay, ie memory leak plugged!

[07:28:06] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix #11757. IE 6/7 can't clean up circular DOM-JS refs. - Dave Methvin
[07:30:48] <DaveMethvin> walking the dog, back in about 30
[07:31:15] <kswedberg> timmywil: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/26bdbb806eeb1d8e1881b3fc11ff298eb4d1dca0#commitcomment-1492545
[07:31:16] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by timmywil (18h, 33m ago): Do jQuery.trim in less bytes (-5).
[07:39:00] <timmywil> kswedberg: ok, I'll do some perfs. It sounds like that thread also wanted to get native trim into jQuery, which is still used when available.
[07:39:48] <kswedberg> right on timmywil
[07:40:55] <kswedberg> here's the original post by Steve Levithan, with his perf results, if you're interested: http://blog.stevenlevithan.com/archives/faster-trim-javascript
[07:44:20] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #171: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/171/
[07:44:20] <jq-jenkins> dave.methvin: Fix #11757. IE 6/7 can't clean up circular DOM-JS refs.
[07:48:39] <timmywil> http://jsperf.com/jquery-trim
[07:49:58] <timmywil> kswedberg: ^^  I'm seeing about the same in Chrome and about 2x faster in FF, althought those have native trim. Checking IE
[07:51:16] <kswedberg> timmywil: cool. and btw, I'm not saying you should change anything back. Just wanted you to be aware of the backstory ahead of time in case someone gets huffy about it
[07:51:47] <timmywil> kswedberg: nono, good to know. I'm just curious now
[07:53:03] <kswedberg> cool. the other variable here of course is string length. I imagine relative perf results will differ depending on that
[07:53:11] <timmywil> true
[07:54:32] <kswedberg> my hunch is:  the longer the string, the slower the single-replace trim would be, while the two-replace trim would stay about the same
[07:55:15] <kswedberg> because the two-replace is anchored to start and end, while the single-replace has the /g flag
[07:57:11] <timmywil> yea, maybe it's worth switching back even though one call with /g is faster for short strings
[07:57:37] <timmywil> so it will be consistently fast
[07:57:43] <kswedberg> dunno. I'm just the reporter, not the decider. :)
[07:58:16] <kswedberg> you also add those bytes back. so that's sad
[07:58:17] <timmywil> I didn't realize all of these perf differences when I made the change to make it smaller
[07:59:27] <timmywil> this is also something that can be changed back after beta
[07:59:28] <kswedberg> yeah. It's really hard for me to know how much of all that is bikeshedding. I suspect most of it.
[07:59:48] <kswedberg> true
[08:07:43] <rick_> timmywil kswedberg it's too bad we're insanely byte stingy
[08:08:33] <kswedberg> rwaldron: yep! competing interests. size v speed
[08:08:34] <rwaldron> it would be nice to have an abstraction that wrapped some contextual optimizations
[08:08:48] <rwaldron> like... short strings, do this. long strings, do that.
[08:08:55] <kswedberg> yeah
[08:09:08] <kswedberg> that'd be nice. but also even MOAR bytes.
[08:09:29] <rwaldron> speaking of byte expenditures
[08:09:53] <rwaldron> for only 75 bytes we can stop using "core_" and make it an object called "core"
[08:10:02] * rwaldron hates core_
[08:10:09] <rwaldron> timmywil DaveMethvin ^^
[08:13:50] <timmywil> rwaldron: I don't like core_ either, but I'd prefer not to add the overhead of property retrieval
[08:19:07] <rwaldron> FINE!
[08:31:11] <timmywil> sry rwaldron :)
[09:07:02] <DaveMethvin> timmywil rwaldron next thing you'll be arguing that _ takes more pixels than .  :D
[09:07:39] <timmywil> i like arguing
[09:07:43] <timmywil> it's fun
[09:08:08] <DaveMethvin> only if I WIN!
[09:08:14] <timmywil> hmm DaveMethvin and rwaldron are the same color in my irc right now. that doesn't happen often
[09:08:38] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I'd like to argue with that point!
[09:13:32] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I wrote a little section on sizzle at the bottom. how's that?
[09:13:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw, looks good timmywil
[09:14:01] <timmywil> cool
[09:14:06] <DaveMethvin> so how bad are the unit tests? haven't checked in a while
[09:14:29] <DaveMethvin> oh good, just those ie8 ones
[09:14:39] <timmywil> yea
[09:14:48] <timmywil> though those effects ones pop up randomly
[09:14:59] <DaveMethvin> i ran against ui and mobile a couple of days ago, just got a couple of fails against ui but mobile was clean
[09:15:10] <DaveMethvin> so i'm good with that for beta
[09:15:20] <timmywil> sounds good to me
[09:15:50] <DaveMethvin> i'll get going on the beta in just a few minutes
[09:15:51] <rwaldron> sames +1
[09:16:17] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron yea there are just a FEW manual steps to get the release out the door
[09:16:36] <rwaldron> Am i doing this?
[09:17:00] <rwaldron> This doc needs updatin'
[09:17:04] <DaveMethvin> if you have some time, let's do it together
[09:17:09] <DaveMethvin> <3
[09:17:13] <rwaldron> I'm ready
[09:17:20] <DaveMethvin> gimme about 10 minutes if you can
[09:17:21] * rwaldron holds DaveMethvin's hand
[09:17:27] <rwaldron> I already did #1
[09:18:13] <DaveMethvin> fresh eyes on the list defn help
[09:18:23] <rwaldron> I also updated #1
[09:18:28] <rwaldron> looking through everything else
[09:18:34] <rwaldron> we need to move release jobs to grunt
[09:18:39] <rwaldron> but that's not urgent
[09:20:25] <rwaldron> YIKES
[09:20:37] <rwaldron> build/release.js will try to run "make && make clean"
[09:20:42] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^^
[09:20:52] <rwaldron> looks like some updates are actually gonna be urgent
[09:21:11] <DaveMethvin> we can do it manually
[09:21:41] <rwaldron> Actually, I think just changing that to "grunt" should do the trick
[09:22:04] <DaveMethvin> i've been eyeing some changes to release.js but putting them off since I new grunt was coming
[09:22:15] <timmywil> curious, why the make clean? didn't that remove everything built?
[09:22:33] <rwaldron> yes, it did
[09:22:54] <timmywil> I guess it still pulled in any changes, but strange
[09:22:58] <rwaldron> yeah
[09:23:19] <rwaldron> have you ever had issues writing to a file that already exists?
[09:23:26] <rwaldron> I have
[09:24:09] <rwaldron> but never with node's fs.writeFile
[09:24:32] <timmywil> with bash, I
[09:24:36] <timmywil> ..
[09:24:47] <timmywil> 've gotten used to doing rm -rf &&
[09:25:10] <timmywil> like with r.js
[09:31:26] <DaveMethvin> my palms get sweaty just typing rm -rf into irc :)
[09:31:47] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron you wanna try building this?
[09:33:29] <rwaldron> sure
[09:34:02] <DaveMethvin> hold on a couple of minutes, sorry
[09:34:32] <rwaldron> haha no problem
[09:55:59] <DaveMethvin> alright rwaldron lets give it another try
[09:56:32] <rwaldron> ok, ready!
[09:57:03] <DaveMethvin> do  you have keys on the server for the copy to code.jquery.com?
[09:57:14] <rwaldron> probably not
[09:57:26] <DaveMethvin> that's fine i can do that part
[09:57:37] <rwaldron> ok
[09:57:45] <DaveMethvin> oh but hmmm i don't know if the script will die gracefully
[09:57:51] <rwaldron> its ok
[09:57:53] <DaveMethvin> it's part of the release.js process
[09:57:54] <rwaldron> we can wait
[09:58:00] <rwaldron> until we have my keys up
[09:58:06] <rwaldron> how about this...
[09:58:12] <rwaldron> let's work through it in person next week
[09:58:18] <rwaldron> like an rc or something
[09:58:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah and there's also beta 2,3,4 :D
[09:58:29] <rwaldron> or even "re-release" 1.8beta
[09:58:32] <rwaldron> right
[09:58:38] <rwaldron> that will be waaaayyyy easier
[09:58:48] <rwaldron> that way you can see if I fuck up

[12:32:25] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: what is 1.7.2 ?
[12:32:34] <gnarf> like 1.7.2 -> 1.8b1 ?
[12:33:21] <DaveMethvin> you mean in a string compare gnarf?
[12:34:23] <gnarf> gzip
[12:34:28] <gnarf> size
[12:34:29] <DaveMethvin> oh, size wise
[12:34:50] <DaveMethvin> http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size
[12:35:12] <DaveMethvin> so we're smaller but not by much
[12:35:14] <gnarf> so um
[12:35:16] <gnarf> yeah
[12:35:22] <DaveMethvin> blame timmywil
[12:35:31] <gnarf> better code, same weight
[12:35:37] <DaveMethvin> we were flirting with 33000 at one point
[12:35:42] <gnarf> we just lost some water weight
[12:35:46] <gnarf> thats all
[12:35:47] <DaveMethvin> haha
[12:35:59] <DaveMethvin> well i could have thrown out $.sub too i think
[12:36:13] <DaveMethvin> but decided it was easier to dump it all into a single 1.9-compat plugin
[12:36:25] <gnarf> hrm
[12:36:31] <gnarf> curious
[12:36:37] <gnarf> could we put it into a deprecated.js
[12:36:39] <DaveMethvin> and saving a few bytes in 1.8 wasn't worth the hassle of having to remember which version what stuff got dumped into the compat plugin
[12:36:45] <gnarf> and have that be an exclusion target?
[12:36:56] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[12:37:25] <gnarf> some of the things can't be done that way obviously
[12:37:32] <gnarf> since they are inside other things in modules
[12:37:51] <DaveMethvin> it might work for some stuff tho
[12:38:22] <DaveMethvin> if we target 1.9 for the major cleanup tho I think that will simplify our life
[12:38:28] <DaveMethvin> cleanup as in throwing it out
[12:38:31] <DaveMethvin> vs just deprecating

[13:28:00] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: rwaldron isn't there gonna be a $.browser "plugin" ?
[13:28:27] <DaveMethvin> yes as part of the 1.9 compat repo
[13:28:36] <DaveMethvin> it says that in the blog doesn't it?
[13:29:39] <DaveMethvin> if not we need to say it
[13:29:53] <DaveMethvin> because YOU KNOW HOW IMPORTANT $.BROWSER ISS!!!! :D
[13:29:57] <ajpiano> it doesn't specificially say that $.browser will be in it
[13:30:05] <ajpiano> but it does specifically say that $.sub will so.....
[13:30:26] <matjas> heads up: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8b1.min.js is missing
[13:31:03] <DaveMethvin> matjas: yes, no min
[13:31:12] <matjas> ah, intentional, i see
[13:31:13] <DaveMethvin> was there a link to one?
[13:31:25] <DaveMethvin> no way i want someone reporting a bug against minified code
[13:31:28] <matjas> no, my script that generates http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size just assumes there is such a resource
[13:31:34] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: nope, but matjas's size thing prolly ...
[13:31:35] <gnarf> ;)
[13:31:38] <matjas> :D
[13:31:57] <DaveMethvin> if the file is missing just put "TOO BIG" there :D
[13:31:59] <matjas> git checkout 2236c55b9135dc9867218cc35b713bacdd0a8350 && grunt
[13:32:00] <matjas> boom
[13:32:26] <DaveMethvin> DAMN YOU OPEN SOURCE!
[13:32:28] <matjas> actually it’s much smaller than 1.7 after minification
[13:32:54] <matjas> of course it’s a moot discussion now that jQuery has modular builds \o/
[13:33:12] <DaveMethvin> "How big is jQuery"?

[13:40:27] <DaveMethvin> geez this joint is jumping on a friday afternoon
[13:40:37] <timmywil> gooooo beta!
[13:40:56] <DaveMethvin> sorry about the late landing gnarf but at least its in -git
[13:41:06] <DaveMethvin> also i think the missing semi was in timo's pull
[13:41:16] <DaveMethvin> and face it, it's only a semicolon
[13:41:18] <gnarf> oh
[13:41:22] <gnarf> damn
[13:41:33] <gnarf> here i'm taking blame for timo
[13:41:39] <gnarf> i thought it was my fault
[13:41:40] <gnarf> :)
[13:41:55] <DaveMethvin> if the worst i got blamed for was a semicolon my life would be unicornish
[13:44:38] <ben_alman> don't you lint stuff?
[13:44:51] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: we didn't lint the unit tests until yesterday
[13:44:53] <ben_alman> i mean, a missing semicolon would indicate someone didn't follow the process?
[13:44:55] <ben_alman> ah ok
[13:44:57] <ben_alman> fair enough
[13:45:06] <ben_alman> well it's nice that you're doing that now
[13:45:26] <DaveMethvin> i should have caught it myself but i have to manually grunt on landing each pull
[13:45:34] <DaveMethvin> well, grunt.cmd
[13:45:44] <ben_alman> you could make it a pre-commit hook
[13:45:54] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you using pulley?
[13:45:57] <ben_alman> there's an open issue about that kind of thing
[13:45:58] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: no
[13:46:10] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it's improved
[13:46:31] <DaveMethvin> so i hear ... you're gonna guilt me into trying it again aren't you :D
[13:46:38] <DaveMethvin> i should
[13:46:40] <ben_alman> in your package.json please change grunt >=0.3.9 to ~0.3.9 before 0.4.0 comes out
[13:46:45] <ben_alman> or you're going to enter a world of hurt
[13:46:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it's much easier to set up now
[13:46:59] <DaveMethvin> can we change the name to gruntfile.js too?
[13:47:19] <ben_alman> not until you actually switch to 0.4.0
[13:47:27] <timmywil> gruntinator.js?
[13:47:30] <ben_alman> you'll need to geep it grunt.js as long as you use 0.3.x
[13:47:52] <DaveMethvin> well rwaldron is my go-to grunt expert
[13:48:00] <ben_alman> ok
[13:48:03] <DaveMethvin> he seems to know the guy who wrote it
[13:48:06] <ben_alman> might as well ask him instead of me
[13:48:16] <gnarf> lol
[13:48:17] <ben_alman> since he handles ad-hoc questions very, very well
[13:48:37] <gnarf> this conversation could only be funnier over a beer at the bar
[13:48:43] <DaveMethvin> oh that reminds me
[13:48:52] <DaveMethvin> poetry readings
[13:49:03] <gnarf> Dramatic Bugs?
[13:49:05] * timmywil giggles
[13:49:09] <DaveMethvin> i wrote a few poems based on bugs
[13:49:16] <gnarf> allowable
[13:49:35] <gnarf> did you see my comment haiku?
[13:49:38] <DaveMethvin> no
[13:49:39] <timmywil> I was a little excited before but now...
[13:49:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah screw the tech presentations, wait for the bug readings!
[13:50:41] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: https://gist.github.com/bb4d8fbf36b0d493c698
[13:51:14] * DaveMethvin wipes away tear
[13:51:28] <DaveMethvin> it's beyoutiful
[13:52:29] <FJ1> how many $.browser are in jqueryui? :-)
[13:53:00] <gnarf> FJ1: less than there used to be every day
[13:53:01] <gnarf> :)

[13:54:12] <ben_alman> it helps me every time i need to share some code i just freakin committed
[13:54:18] <ben_alman> which is like, every 10 minutes
[13:56:31] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i read that comment in the original source and took me a bit to figure it out
[13:57:14] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #173: STILL FAILING in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/173/
[13:57:15] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Fix #11925, Pass eventHandle to special.teardown. Closes gh-831.
[13:57:15] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Fix #11797. Use Deferred for better animation callbacks. Closes gh-830.
[13:57:16] <jq-jenkins> * dave.methvin: Add a semicolon in unit test; this pull predated lint mandate.
[13:57:53] <gnarf> I dunno why but I always imagine jq-jenkins raising his fist to the sky when he says STILL FAILING
[14:00:43] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: did you still want to add that note on :active or just leave it for the next one?
[14:01:06] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: usually we do the whole changelog on each beta/release
[14:01:12] <DaveMethvin> so we'll catch it next time
[14:01:19] <timmywil> ok
[14:01:22] <DaveMethvin> i think unit tests are okay i think we're okay tho http://swarm.jquery.org/job/75
[14:01:34] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, overpasted
[14:01:52] <DaveMethvin> there seem to be a few of the random ones this time thru
[14:01:59] <DaveMethvin> at least i hope they are random
[14:02:04] <timmywil> agreed, those look like the normal testswarm failures
[14:02:55] <DaveMethvin> "normal testswarm failures" :(
[14:03:08] <DaveMethvin> jenkins, we want to love you
[14:03:14] <DaveMethvin> but we've been hurt so many times before
[14:03:25] <timmywil> true fact
[14:04:02] <DaveMethvin> alright, i have a few errands to run, probably back in about half an hour
[14:45:49] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4148678 :)
[14:53:37] <ajpiano> oh joy
[14:53:54] <ajpiano> quick scan through that thread is all i need to remind me it's friday and there's other things to do
[14:53:54] <ajpiano> :|

[15:42:53] <snover> i hope nobody is doing that
[15:53:30] <gnarf> damn
[15:53:32] <gnarf> DaveMethvin:
[15:53:43] <gnarf> jQuery.fn.jquery === "@VERSION" in 1.8b1
[15:54:18] <DaveMethvin> another thing to fix i suppose
[15:54:37] <DaveMethvin> the release.js script failed and i had to patch it
[15:55:06] <DaveMethvin> it really needs quite a bit of work
[15:55:23] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, i figured this was just one of the things that it didn't do right
[15:55:37] <gnarf> thought you should add it to a list if we already had one
[16:05:52] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: the ajaxStart stuff
[16:05:55] <gnarf> 1.8? or 1.9?
[16:06:08] <gnarf> thats just deprication notice right, not whats hapening in 1.8?
[16:06:18] <DaveMethvin> right, deprecation in 1.8
[16:06:21] <gnarf> or did we actually yank it
[16:06:22] <gnarf> ok
[16:06:35] <gnarf> It might not be entirely clear when reading
[16:06:50] <gnarf> since the others say "as of 1.9 ...." and it doesn't
[16:08:20] <DaveMethvin> rewritten gnarf

[18:38:07] <gnarf> man - tearing out anim.tick made this a bitch to punch http://jsbin.com/ilumef/6/edit#javascript,html
[18:49:56] * gnarf frowns
[18:50:03] <gnarf> All alone on a friday night...
[18:50:04] <gnarf> http://jsbin.com/ilumef/7/edit
[18:50:18] <gnarf> no gibson, dave, mike to bounce ideas off of
[19:30:23] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: hey - maybe .progress() wasn't such a bad idea for a callback
[19:30:30] <gnarf> http://jsbin.com/ilumef/7/edit
[19:30:36] <gnarf> inspired by @padolsey
[19:31:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah gnarf i saw that suggestion ... is it high overhead compared to a simple callback?
[19:31:21] <DaveMethvin> wouldn't think it was too bad compared to the length of an animation
[19:32:47] <DaveMethvin> although that demo does peg one of my cpus :D
[19:58:08] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: its already on the deferred
[19:58:26] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: like 2 lines of code cost, and implements the "simple callback"
[19:59:00] <DaveMethvin> well if it's such as good idea, where's the pull request? :D
[19:59:03] <gnarf> I just had to overwrite the actual "progress" to give myself a hook for it in the demo
[19:59:14] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: arriving tomorrow
[19:59:23] <DaveMethvin> i didn't even think about it until i saw the note in the ticket earlier today
[19:59:33] <DaveMethvin> and then i had one of those forehead smack moments
[20:12:49] <gnarf> yup
[20:13:08] <gnarf> I'm gonna apologize
[20:13:09] <gnarf> :)
