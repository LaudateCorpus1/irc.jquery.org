[10:31:08] <agcolom> Our sites seems to become slow to respond from time to time (all projects main sites and api docs) for the past few mins
[10:31:56] <agcolom> noted about 10 mins ago, Then all was back to normal, and not responding again now
[10:33:37] <agcolom> s5fs gnarf ryanneufeld ^ if you are around...
[10:34:11] <agcolom> try for example http://api.jqueryui.com/
[10:35:16] <agcolom> it's back on again...
[10:35:37] <gnarf> agcolom: it doesn't seem to be server related
[10:35:43] <agcolom> strange.
[10:36:03] <agcolom> are you seeing any pb your end?
[10:36:28] <gnarf> can you try to get a network timeline from chrome for a bad request?
[10:36:40] <agcolom> sure
[10:36:59] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/432X0Q0R2c2m 
[10:37:11] <gnarf> looking at the graphs, i see pretty steady traffic over the last hour
[10:37:36] <agcolom> I'm getting "https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0da75906b1cc0f8bc9f2"
[10:38:16] <gnarf> ping jq01.jquery.com / traceroute jq01.jquery.com ?
[10:38:56] <agcolom> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/650f45d703ca902050bc
[10:39:34] <agcolom> traceroute ongoing...
[10:39:51] <agcolom> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cbe2916fa8f783270488
[10:41:48] <agcolom> it's working fine again!
[10:42:10] <agcolom> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/92f7df1f7026f0a6eaea
[10:42:30] <gnarf> hrm
[10:42:59] <gnarf> might be (mt)'s fault
[10:43:01] <agcolom> so this time, no pb: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/3cd21a76710971e1cc5a
[10:43:16] <gnarf> yeah something in that route seems broken
[10:43:25] <gnarf> either way its outside our scope to fix i think 
[10:43:39] <agcolom> sure, ok. Thanks
[10:43:49] <gnarf> they are probably aware/on it
[10:44:03] <agcolom> I was worried our servers had pbs.
[10:44:41] <agcolom> Thanks and hope you have a good weekend!
[11:53:28] <s5fs> agcolom: i'm pleased to have been first in your list when asking for help haha! sorry i was away wrangling children tho
[12:19:37] <agcolom> s5fs: ha yes, I felt bad asking on a sunday. Luckily it wasn't anything serious ;-)
[17:32:04] <s5fs> agcolom: no worries, if you have a real emergency or need faster support, please email me directly or call.
[17:32:18] <s5fs> irc is convenient but i'm not fully integrated (yet)
