[05:51:32] <_|Nix|_> Hey! When removing all the classes from an element with removeClass, is it intentional that the attribute is left in place, but set to ""?
[05:52:04] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: that's the way the class attribute rolls, it is always an empty string
[05:52:13] <DaveMethvin> if there arent' any classes defined
[05:52:43] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: I'm just asking because our unit tests failed again because of an empty but present class attribute.
[05:53:04] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[05:53:08] <_|Nix|_> Like, $( "<div></div>" ).addClass( "something" ).removeClass( "something" ) ...
[05:53:18] <DaveMethvin> class is one of those that has a corresponding property
[05:53:20] <DaveMethvin> className
[05:53:21] <_|Nix|_> That results in "<div class></div>
[05:53:29] <DaveMethvin> and className is always a string
[05:54:09] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Doesn't the browser maintain .className though?
[05:54:16] <DaveMethvin> yes
[05:54:35] <DaveMethvin> so did this change recently?
[05:54:53] <_|Nix|_> Yes. It broke last night with b9dfcfd7362825ccda0ca4ea96d385b0c6ae522d from core.
[05:55:05] <DaveMethvin> oh, let me look
[05:55:51] <scott_gonzalez> Wow, that is a horrible comment.
[05:56:05] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea why that sandboxing exists.
[05:56:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah, but also i don't know why that would break classes
[05:58:19] <gibson042> _|Nix|_: are you sure it wasn't with 07662406e1125cc7b5dc084fdd63b29644417d33 or 0877d424e08d57e6f0d1da9a86289fb10d0ee136?
[05:58:46] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: I'm about to do a bisect
[05:58:49] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: did you bisect it down to that one?
[05:58:59] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: No. That's from jenkins.
[05:59:05] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Bisecting now.
[05:59:25] <DaveMethvin> actually, i'm not sure why he needed to sandbox start() anyway
[05:59:45] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: There's been a sizzle update between the last known good (53a06660d82d03dfff52a03a91f7d4408b6e6e47) and b9dfcfd7362825ccda0ca4ea96d385b0c6ae522d.
[06:00:02] <DaveMethvin> intentional, or unintentional? :D
[06:00:05] <gibson042> I can see now that it was me
[06:00:36] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: Got a commitid?
[06:00:59] <gibson042> the two that I pasted above (jaubourg mistakenly re-committed)
[06:01:36] <gibson042> I removed a guard that required className to start non-empty
[06:02:11] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/0877d424e08d57e6f0d1da9a86289fb10d0ee136#L2L86
[06:05:21] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: That is indeed the commit that breaks it.
[06:05:29] <gibson042> since we're looking at it, *should* there be a removeAttribute?
[06:05:42] <gibson042> or is the old behavior fine?
[06:06:27] <DaveMethvin> good question ... i just thought the browser made it happen automagically
[06:06:40] <DaveMethvin> time for a test case
[06:07:00] <DaveMethvin> jsfiddle is down!
[06:07:10] <DaveMethvin> jsbin is up
[06:07:12] <_|Nix|_> Well, when you set a class with .addClass() it instantiates a new attribute, so it makes sense that .removeClass() invert that.
[06:07:46] <_|Nix|_> NaÃ¯vely speaking ...
[06:08:27] <_|Nix|_> ... and it /was/ doing it so far.
[06:08:31] <gibson042>  _|Nix|_: can you link to the test that broke?
[06:09:19] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: It's a rather complicated test, but sure ... http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/jquery-mobile/tests/unit/select/?testNumber=34
[06:10:12] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: But it suffices if you type $( "<div></div>" ).addClass( "some-class" ).removeClass( "some-class" ) into Chrome Developer Tools JS console.
[06:10:54] <gibson042> *that* shouldn't be different....
[06:11:18] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: Well, the result as of that commit is "<div class></div>"
[06:12:53] <gibson042> I get same results for that line before and after my commit
[06:12:58] <DaveMethvin> Seems we've been leaving the class in place in the past, with a value of an empty string
[06:12:58] <DaveMethvin> http://jsbin.com/ulidoj/1/edit
[06:13:06] <DaveMethvin> that's 1.7.2
[06:13:16] <gibson042> it's only different on .removeClass when there *wasn't* previously a class
[06:13:38] <_|Nix|_> OK ... weird ... lemme check the test ...
[06:14:29] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: the change is for something like $("<div>").removeClass("foo")
[06:14:39] <gibson042> previously, it was noop
[06:14:49] <gibson042> now it sets elem.className = ""
[06:15:21] <gibson042> but since I'm here anyway, I'm wondering if we want to removeAttribute("class") instead of setting to empty string
[06:15:41] <DaveMethvin> i fear changing anything about adding or removing classes
[06:15:48] <_|Nix|_> I ran our unit test against HEAD~1 from that commit, and the left and right side are equal. Then, I ran the unit test against that commit, and the right side has an extra empty class attribute.
[06:16:29] <DaveMethvin> someone is depending on this behavior
[06:16:45] <DaveMethvin> so i'd go back to 1.8 behavior and be done
[06:16:49] <gibson042> back to 1.8 it is, then
[06:17:26] <_|Nix|_> Look, it's only our unit tests, so I can update the test. NP.
[06:17:31] <_|Nix|_> It's not in production.
[06:17:46] <gibson042> no,  you've identified a change that we don't want
[06:17:53] <gibson042> your tests can stay ;)
[06:17:53] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: OK.
[06:18:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah, you just know someone may be depending on the way used to work
[06:19:14] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: thanks for letting us know on this, we have made a bunch of changes in the past week and will be making a bunch more in the next so just yell if we break anything
[06:19:31] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: NP. I can file a bug if you'd like.
[06:19:44] <DaveMethvin> i think gibson042 has it
[06:20:22] <gibson042> is this worth a ticket?
[06:20:32] <DaveMethvin> i'd just do it :D
[06:20:48] <gibson042> sensitive subject ;)
[06:21:02] <DaveMethvin> since it's fixing something that just broke, we don't need a record for the release changelog
[06:21:09] <gibson042> my thoughts too
[06:37:05] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: It's weird ... if I do this: var before = "<div></div>", after = $( before ).addClass( "something" ).removeClass( "something" ).appendTo( "<div></div>" ).parent().html(); I get the empty class attribute both before and after your commit. Yet the google chrome js console outputs things differently before and after your commit, and the presence/absence of the attribute is also different.
[06:37:45] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: Maybe it's the fact that I'm wrapping it in a parent and outputting its html() ...
[06:38:18] <gibson042> I don't know; there should be no behavior change from that case
[06:44:40] <_|Nix|_> gibson042: Well, I've just been trying to come up with a simplified version of that unit test that might be helpful for core. I guess I'm too much of a n00b when it comes to core issues.

[09:45:31] <DaveMethvin> i would do it in bulk but i have to review them
[09:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you don't default to a milestone?
[09:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> I guess not.
[09:46:40] <DaveMethvin> the default is usualy None
[09:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that makes sense.
[09:46:53] <DaveMethvin> but these were manually set to 1.9
[09:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> For UI, we default to the next major release.
[09:46:59] <DaveMethvin> almost done, just one or two more
[09:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, well this is nothing compared to what happens when I do this in UI :-P
[09:47:50] <scott_gonzalez> Although, we're under 400 tickets now!

[12:17:05] <paul_irish> we'll have to proxy it through the h5bp org
[12:17:14] <mikesherov> sure! that works

[12:28:21] <paul_irish> "This repository is awaiting GitHub staff approval to transfer ownership to mikesherov."
[12:28:32] <mikesherov> it looks like nothing
[12:28:36] <paul_irish> OK
[12:28:37] <paul_irish> well.
[12:28:38] <paul_irish> we'll see.
[12:28:45] <mikesherov> seems like we have to wait on github staff apparently
[12:29:22] <DaveMethvin> I don't recall the "Rubber stamp transfer approver guy is a Githubber" post on their blog
[12:29:45] <DaveMethvin> dammit nexus 4 site!
[12:29:50] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: lols all around. Probably because it's got 250+ stars or something like that
[12:30:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah i can imagine some human intervention is in order
[12:31:47] <mikesherov> otherwise there'd be a blog post "Oh noes, github allows no verification transfer of popular repos".
[12:32:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah like one of us would get drunk and transfer the jquery repos to david mark
[12:33:17] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[12:33:45] <scott_gonzalez> David Mark would probably reject the transfer :-P

[17:45:15] <ajpiano> dju see the e-mail i just fwded
[17:45:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i hate when he's right, wonder if he can help
[17:45:34] <ajpiano> yea
[17:45:39] <ajpiano> i think i'm gonna redo the box on bugs.jquery.com
[17:45:43] <ajpiano> some of the things he's not right about
[17:45:54] <ajpiano> anonymous submissions are really not a useful thing imo
[17:45:59] <DaveMethvin> ageed
[17:46:09] <DaveMethvin> it SEEMS like it should be good but it's not really
[17:46:20] <DaveMethvin> none of the browser guys allow anon
[17:46:25] <ajpiano> and we already do cross post things if they are *notabug*
[17:46:46] <DaveMethvin> definitely good to redo that box
[17:47:12] <snover> oh, you guys are getting rid of anon posts?
[17:47:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and block that snover guy too ajpiano
[17:47:41] <snover> :(
[17:47:52] <DaveMethvin> aw don't take it personally!
[17:47:56] <snover> so unfurrrr
[17:47:58] <DaveMethvin> take it anonymously! :D
[17:48:02] <snover> ermahgerd
[17:48:13] <ajpiano> snover: no, someone's saying that if we use gh issues for site/docs bugs
[17:48:16] <DaveMethvin> where are my unicode faces when i need them
[17:48:19] <ajpiano> then that should *also* allow registration
[17:48:40] <DaveMethvin> gh issues are so weeak tho
[17:48:43] <snover> i donâ€™t get it
[17:48:46] <snover> yeah they are
[17:48:53] <DaveMethvin> good in many ways but not very useful as a bug db
[17:49:11] <snover> the issue tracker on github is really the pinnacle of incremental enhancement
[17:49:22] <snover> snail slow enhanacement
[17:49:28] <ajpiano> well it's not like we're gonna set up trac for 18 websites
[17:49:29] <ajpiano> :p
[17:49:35] <DaveMethvin> amen bro
[17:49:42] <ajpiano> yeesh
[17:52:30] <ajpiano> also, how do we make people understand that setting up a local apache is not so scary
[17:52:39] <ajpiano> otoh i think we probably need an even simpler install
[17:53:12] <DaveMethvin> we've talked about doing some simple node server
[17:53:37] <DaveMethvin> but then we also would need to redo testwwarm i fear
[17:56:37] <ajpiano> it's an attitude thing
[17:56:49] <ajpiano> people either are or aren't willing to set up local environments out of their comfort zone
[17:57:10] <ajpiano> i'm not a ruby or php or python expert but i've gotten projects in all three running locally so i can work on the front end
[17:57:58] <DaveMethvin> agreed on the attitude ... if there's some way to make it easier i'm all for it though
[17:58:04] <ajpiano> but i also get it, because sometimes trying to get a new environment up and running is just a never ending circle of failure
[17:58:24] <DaveMethvin> hey  you're talking to a guy who runs WINDOWS
[18:04:20] <ajpiano> right
[18:04:36] <ajpiano> but he could have gotten xampp or wamp up and running in the time it took to write this email
[18:04:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah, installing some web server is easy
[18:05:02] <DaveMethvin> even on windows
[18:05:06] <ajpiano> that's what i'm saying about attitude
[18:05:25] <DaveMethvin> i think it's more about someone who is more end-user than developer
[18:05:41] <ajpiano> i suppose
[18:05:52] <DaveMethvin> they're more comfortable running an installer and reading the docs
[18:05:52] <ajpiano> but clearly there are end users who want to contribute
[18:05:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[18:06:07] <DaveMethvin> which is both the good and bad of our new docs for example
[18:06:11] <ajpiano> saying "you guys should do a better job" is... not quite that
[18:06:16] <ajpiano> yeah
[18:06:31] <DaveMethvin> well us guys are all pedaling as fast as we can
[18:06:52] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: http://learn.jquery.com/contributing/ donno if you've seen that yet
[18:07:06] <DaveMethvin> oh that's nice
[18:08:27] <ajpiano> i hope we can just hold people's hands and get them to buy in
[18:09:51] <ajpiano> in the long run, all of open source requires you to buy in to a certain set of tools
[18:10:04] <ajpiano> and if you don't want to that's fun but you're not really going to be able to help anywhere
[18:10:20] <ajpiano> anyway
[18:10:41] <DaveMethvin> i agree, we often know that things need fixing but it takes time for each item
[18:10:47] <DaveMethvin> we need people who will spend time doing it
[18:11:21] <ajpiano> not express their disbelief that it has not yet be completed
[18:11:22] <ajpiano> alas

[19:44:44] <DaveMethvin> hey pbramos, missed your ping
[19:45:04] <pbramos> Hey DaveMethvin  - just letting you know I'm around if you wanted to discuss the issue
[19:45:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah, what a tricky one
[19:45:37] <DaveMethvin> i keep staring at it and thinking there must be a way
[19:45:46] <DaveMethvin> but that bug didn't get such a low number for nothing
[19:56:40] <pbramos> I spent a good deal of time considering alternatives over the past couple weeks
[19:56:52] <pbramos> IT's definitely tricky :)
[20:00:09] <pbramos> This problem in its simplest form is "Does the destination include the origin element"
[20:00:32] <pbramos> Which means those comparisons need to be made at some point
[20:00:48] <DaveMethvin> right, and it infects so many apis so some central location for the fix makes sense
