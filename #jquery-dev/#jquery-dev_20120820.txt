[05:20:30] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix #12282. IE has premature .readyState == "interactive". Close gh-901. - Mike Sherov
[05:25:25] <jaubourg> hi there
[05:25:26] <bot-t> (16 hours 40 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell jaubourg please review the conversation ben_alman and I had about deferreds here: http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery-dev/%23jquery-dev_20120819.log.html#t11:13:20
[05:33:06] <jaubourg> ?tell mikesherov I answered in the bug tracker, it all boils down to this: 1) you cannot wrap single values into arrays or you make it impossible for when to use the result of another when call without incurring that many dereference 2) you cannot ignore multiple
[05:33:06] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[05:33:15] <jaubourg> god I hate my keyboard
[05:33:37] <jaubourg> ?tell mikesherov ... values, so you have to make do with a mix of both
[05:33:37] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[05:34:20] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #325: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/325/
[05:34:20] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Fix #12329. Remove leftover jQuery.bindReady reference.
[05:34:44] <jaubourg> ?tell mikesherov if it was up to me and we didn't have to deal with back-compat in ajax and such, I'd limit resolution/rejection to a single value without ontext and things would be soooo much simpler
[05:34:45] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[05:35:49] <jaubourg> dunno if I make sense though
[05:58:02] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: hi :)
[05:58:21] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg
[05:58:32] <jaubourg> had a question about the DC thing
[05:59:08] <DaveMethvin> fire away
[06:00:09] <jaubourg> I see that hotel will be booked with a Monday check-in... but with between 9 and 15 hours of flight, it would make sense for an international flyer to arrive on Sunday
[06:01:07] <jaubourg> I looked into tickets and it's difficult to get something that would arrive in the morning, and that's not counting crossing the border and all
[06:01:40] <DaveMethvin> we can arrange for the border patrol to hold you overnight :D
[06:01:41] <jaubourg> maybe JÃ¶rn has a tip though
[06:01:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah seems reasonable to add a day
[06:02:03] <DaveMethvin> check with jzaefferer and see what he's doing
[06:02:10] <jaubourg> yeah, I'll do that
[06:02:47] <jaubourg> thanks and sorry to have paused your jQuery morning run
[06:03:23] <DaveMethvin> np, i'm actually amazed i am getting things done this early
[06:03:29] <DaveMethvin> coffeeee
[06:04:36] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #326: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/326/
[06:04:37] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Fix #12282. IE has premature .readyState == "interactive". Close gh-901.
[06:04:50] <jaubourg> btw, ticket #12348 brought me back to #10811 and I suddenly realized this xmorel character acted the same "can't you read way" with you in this blur/focus ticket
[06:06:10] <jaubourg> omg, just saw the name of the bot
[06:06:16] <jaubourg> am I blind or what?
[06:06:21] <jaubourg> nice one :)
[06:07:03] <DaveMethvin> oh boy, two different errors
[06:07:27] <DaveMethvin> looks like i missed committing a file
[06:09:25] <mikesherov> .
[06:09:25] <bot-t> (36 mins 10 secs ago) <jaubourg> tell mikesherov I answered in the bug tracker, it all boils down to this: 1) you cannot wrap single values into arrays or you make it impossible for when to use the result of another when call without incurring that many dereference 2) you cannot ignore multiple
[06:09:25] <bot-t> (35 mins 40 secs ago) <jaubourg> tell mikesherov ... values, so you have to make do with a mix of both
[06:09:26] <bot-t> (34 mins 40 secs ago) <jaubourg> tell mikesherov if it was up to me and we didn't have to deal with back-compat in ajax and such, I'd limit resolution/rejection to a single value without ontext and things would be soooo much simpler
[06:09:55] <DaveMethvin> .
[06:10:13] <mikesherov> Hey DaveMethvin, saw you didn't merge the doc ready PR
[06:10:24] <DaveMethvin> well i did now
[06:10:28] <DaveMethvin> but i think i missed a file
[06:10:29] <mikesherov> Oh, awesome
[06:10:39] <mikesherov> did you miss the file I added?
[06:11:25] <mikesherov> looks like you got everything
[06:11:33] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/165404
[06:11:46] <DaveMethvin> not sure what happened
[06:11:54] <DaveMethvin> it was a single commit that i cherrry-picked
[06:13:02] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah now it's failing here too
[06:14:27] <mikesherov> weird, got a 404 on the IFRAME
[06:15:33] <mikesherov> looks like the swarm couldn't find the file?
[06:16:04] <DaveMethvin> i think i must have not committed it
[06:16:23] <DaveMethvin> it's definitely that commit
[06:16:54] <DaveMethvin> nope the file is there
[06:17:28] <mikesherov> yeah, weird
[06:18:05] <DaveMethvin> but master is failing locally
[06:18:12] <DaveMethvin> the test times otu
[06:18:14] <DaveMethvin> out
[06:20:41] <mikesherov> the run result shows 404 though
[06:21:21] <DaveMethvin> The requested URL /jquery/test/data/event/promiseReady.html.html was not found on this server.
[06:21:26] <DaveMethvin> why the .html.html there?
[06:21:28] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[06:21:43] <DaveMethvin> all the files have .html appended
[06:22:22] <DaveMethvin> whoops, testinit
[06:22:50] <DaveMethvin> but how did that ... ?
[06:23:43] <mikesherov> I modified testinit
[06:24:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah and the commit got it
[06:24:17] <DaveMethvin> but somehow that run used the old one that appended the extension???
[06:24:56] <mikesherov> possibly caching issue?
[06:25:25] <DaveMethvin> yes
[06:25:29] <DaveMethvin> NOW it works locally
[06:25:37] <DaveMethvin> but i thought they re-pulled for each run??
[06:26:07] <mikesherov> I dunno
[06:26:45] <DaveMethvin> anyway, you know that simple "remove BOM in $.trim" pull?
[06:26:46] <DaveMethvin> it's breaking
[06:27:04] <DaveMethvin> looks like safari 5.0 String.trim doesn't remove BOM
[06:27:08] <DaveMethvin> FML
[06:28:17] <gibson042> that's hilarious
[06:28:51] <DaveMethvin> so typical
[06:29:21] <DaveMethvin> which of course if we wanted to fix this, now we have to feature detect the bad implementation and fix it
[06:29:40] <DaveMethvin> lemme just stare at the test case a bit more
[06:30:23] <DaveMethvin> yep, it's broken
[06:33:24] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/897#discussion_r1402074
[06:33:25] <jaubourg> OMG, that's sad but it can be feature detected
[06:34:54] <jaubourg> yeah, it's not the same thing but of the same caliber: assume anything in browser implementations and be in for a big surprise
[06:35:12] <jaubourg> hi gibson042 and mikesherov btw
[06:35:26] <gibson042> hi :)

[06:36:48] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Revert "Fix #12350. Remove BOM in jQuery.trim. Close gh-897." - Dave Methvin
[06:37:56] <jaubourg> man, lots of Deferred noise on twitter coming from Taiwan http://coscup.org/2012/en/ ... the reach sometimes amazes me
[06:37:59] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: How long will we be supporting Safari 5.0?
[06:38:29] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: which iphone still uses it?
[06:38:52] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[06:38:55] <DaveMethvin> i'm guessing that's our reason for needing suppport
[06:39:10] <scott_gonzalez> 3G?
[06:39:13] <scott_gonzalez> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_version_history
[06:39:13] <jaubourg> yeah, probably
[06:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'm making a horrible guess that iOS versions will match up with Safari versions :-P
[06:40:16] <DaveMethvin> iphones are the new windows xp, they make us keep browser support for years longer than we otherwise would
[06:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm having trouble finding a page showing which version of Safari comes with which iOS versions.
[06:45:17] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: me too
[06:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We should make it clear what versions of Safari we support. Since current - 1 is no longer true.
[06:46:02] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: oh you mean we don't just support two versions?
[06:46:14] <DaveMethvin> i think we had that debate about what a version was a while back
[06:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we treat 5.0 and 5.1 and two major versions.
[06:46:23] <scott_gonzalez> 6.0 is current now.
[06:46:58] <gibson042> scott_gonazlez: mikesherov was looking for that list a while back; I think he found *something* but it wasn't as good as we hoped for
[06:47:05] <DaveMethvin> right b/c iphone is (i think) holding us back
[06:47:10] <DaveMethvin> it's like ie now
[06:47:21] <DaveMethvin> or android browser for that matter
[06:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: I found this SO thread with mikesherov: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8627968/what-version-of-mobile-safari-comes-with-each-version-of-ios
[06:49:43] <DaveMethvin> i want to do a blog post about which browsers we support
[06:50:00] <DaveMethvin> and then nuke all the places where we have lists and create the One True List
[06:50:11] <DaveMethvin> brb
[06:51:27] <gibson042> :w
[06:51:31] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #327: STILL FAILING in 14 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/327/
[06:51:32] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Revert "Fix #12350. Remove BOM in jQuery.trim. Close gh-897."
[07:00:58] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, still doesn't seem to have the right files on swarm: http://swarm.jquery.org/result/165475
[07:01:09] <DaveMethvin> got payin work to do, gotta run
[07:09:43] <jaubourg> gibson042: I don't get the difference in your new PR
[07:09:45] <jaubourg> the trim one
[07:10:20] <gibson042> it uses BOM as the test instead of NBSP
[07:12:15] <jaubourg> oh, still no proper feature inference, just a weak one?
[07:12:41] <jaubourg> core_rnotwhite.test("\xA0\uFEFF") ?
[07:13:31] <gibson042> I waffled on that, but \xA0 is unnecessary given our supported browsers
[07:14:08] <jaubourg> I dunno, it can't hurt and it's actually correct
[07:14:13] <jaubourg> shouldn't it gzip better?
[07:15:12] <gibson042> I thought so, but it's actually a small hit
[07:15:44] <gibson042> +4 bytes
[07:15:50] <jaubourg> weird
[07:15:57] <jaubourg> probably situational mess
[07:16:13] <gibson042> yeah
[07:16:35] <jaubourg> arf, I hate the test and the way it works probably as much as the barely disguised IE sniff for dom readiness
[07:17:24] <jaubourg> I sometimes have the feeling we're getting back to fugly inferences... wasn't the web supposed to be a better place by now?
[07:18:07] <gibson042> that just means the crazy edge cases get smaller and smaller
[07:19:16] <jaubourg> you mean in byte size, rigth? not in number :P
[07:19:34] <gibson042> exactly
[07:19:48] <gibson042> or perhaps in frequency
[07:20:18] <jaubourg> I wish, demultiplication of browsers just demultiplicated the source of inconsistencies
[07:20:30] <jaubourg> before you had 2k inconsistencies in a browser
[07:21:16] <jaubourg> now we have to deal with 6 conflicting minds or so it seems to me at times
[07:21:52] <gibson042> yep
[07:22:17] <gibson042> the inconsistency count only grows, even as the frequency of hitting any given bug decreases
[07:22:28] <gibson042> .05% of code is just screwed
[07:23:04] <jaubourg> \o/
[07:23:22] <jaubourg> I feel old
[09:00:48] <DaveMethvin> meeting time!
[09:01:50] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg timmywill rwaldron gibson042 gnarf  meeting time!
[09:24:41] <jaubourg> mikesherov
[09:25:19] <jaubourg> ...
[09:25:24] <jaubourg> anyway, gotta fly
[09:26:31] <DaveMethvin> btw gibson042 thanks for that solution on the BOM-trimmer, haven't tried it but it seems it should work
[09:29:43] <mikesherov> hi
[09:29:50] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: sorry I missed the meeting
[09:29:56] <mikesherov> I was dealing with a work issue
[09:29:58] <DaveMethvin> np mikesherov
[09:30:03] <DaveMethvin> that's what they pay you for
[09:30:09] <DaveMethvin> we're good
[09:30:27] <DaveMethvin> we're aiming for a release on Thursday
[09:30:43] <DaveMethvin> it may be an RC depending on whether we think it needs one
[09:31:05] <mikesherov> 1.8 WAS the rc
[09:31:06] <mikesherov> :-P
[09:31:31] <DaveMethvin> YEAH
[09:31:53] <DaveMethvin> we'll see if we can get people to pay better attention in 1.9
[09:32:11] <mikesherov> I don't mind
[09:32:16] <mikesherov> it's the same thing really
[09:32:33] <mikesherov> we should always just plan a follow up release 2 weeks after a major release
[09:32:38] <mikesherov> the rest is just semantics
[09:33:12] <DaveMethvin> for 1.9 i want to do a series of blog posts going over the major removals and changes
[09:33:16] <DaveMethvin> so ppl won't be surprised
[09:33:31] <mikesherov> yeah
[09:33:38] <DaveMethvin> the ppl who will install 1.9.0 and say OMG $.BROWSER IS GONE!
[09:34:02] <DaveMethvin> oh that reminds me i was gonna fix that $.browser.chrome bug
[10:04:56] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: question for you
[10:05:14] <DaveMethvin> i am currently taking easy questions john
[10:05:21] <johnbender> how do I go about rebasing something onto the code that was released in 1.8.0
[10:05:30] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: specifically
[10:05:32] <johnbender> sizzle
[10:05:56] <DaveMethvin> you want to use 1.8.0 swith a different sizzle?
[10:06:05] <johnbender> rebasing on to the core codebase is easy but I see a diff with sizzle
[10:06:23] <DaveMethvin> sizzle is its own submodule
[10:06:31] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: right
[10:06:33] <DaveMethvin> so you'd get a copy of sizze and edit that
[10:06:37] <johnbender> how do I ensure it's at the right commit?
[10:06:46] <DaveMethvin> go into src/sizzle
[10:06:47] <johnbender> grunt submodules
[10:06:54] <johnbender> ?
[10:06:58] <DaveMethvin> and then change the commit
[10:07:04] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: too?
[10:07:06] <johnbender> *to?
[10:07:16] <johnbender> how do I know which commit?
[10:07:30] <DaveMethvin> generally it will be the lattest one
[10:07:40] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: if I'm using the latest jquery core
[10:07:50] <DaveMethvin> so you have a copy of sizzle in johnbender/sizzle on github
[10:07:56] <johnbender> nope
[10:08:01] <johnbender> it's just in src/sizzle
[10:08:09] <DaveMethvin> well you'll need one if you want to change sizzle
[10:08:14] <DaveMethvin> so fork it
[10:08:14] <johnbender> I don't
[10:08:25] <DaveMethvin> hey waitaminit
[10:08:28] <johnbender> I just want to make sure it's the same commit that was used in the build for 1.8
[10:08:32] <DaveMethvin> oh
[10:08:34] <johnbender> sorry
[10:08:38] <DaveMethvin> np
[10:08:38] <johnbender> bad explanation
[10:08:44] <DaveMethvin> well in that case you're good as is
[10:08:58] <DaveMethvin> oh but you want 1.8.0
[10:09:01] <johnbender> yes
[10:09:04] <johnbender> not the latest
[10:09:25] <DaveMethvin> in that case you should checkout the hash for the one that was  used in 1.8
[10:09:26] <DaveMethvin> lemme get a link
[10:09:49] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: yes! just need to know where to find that
[10:09:50] <johnbender> :D
[10:10:59] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/tree/95559f5117c8a21c1b8cc99f4badc320fd3dcbda/src
[10:11:18] <DaveMethvin> that's the commit for the 1.8.0 and the sizzle commit was feb5de3
[10:11:31] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: feb5de3
[10:11:34] <johnbender> yar!
[10:11:35] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: thanks
[10:11:36] <DaveMethvin> so you should be able to go into the sizzle dir and git checkout feb5de3
[10:11:48] <johnbender> any idea where that info comes from on the command line?
[10:12:05] <DaveMethvin> git tags maybe?
[10:14:27] <DaveMethvin> well i can git checkout 1.8.0 and git submodule to get some hashes :D
[10:38:13] <DaveMethvin> elijahmanor: ping ... remember this one? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12266
[10:38:40] <DaveMethvin> how did you narrow it down to the line in http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12266#comment:4
[10:47:08] <danheberden> i just got a phone call from someone having problems accessing the jquery api docs; how the fuck did they get my #?
[10:47:15] <danheberden> creepy
[11:05:08] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: is your number listed on the doman registrar's info?
[11:05:22] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: umm... i don't know?
[13:52:57] <johnbender> gnarf: did you see my Vagrant PR?
[13:58:37] <gnarf> johnbender: i did
[13:59:08] <gnarf> johnbender: looks pretty decent to me, still need to test it out
[13:59:24] <gnarf> if you want to merge it into puppet-stage - feel free - everything is pretty "contained" in the directory
[14:31:19] <johnbender> gnarf: cool, definitely excited for you to try it out. I'm sure there are a few issues we'll need to address but hopefully nothing two drastic
[15:32:39] <johnbender> gnarf: done

[20:34:06] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Fix #12333. Chrome needs $.browser.webkit too.
[20:51:03] <dialman> Is this the right place to ask: I am trying to run grunt under windows, I've read the FAQ, I am getting up through dist/jquery.min.js and jquery.js being built, but then it fails with:
[20:51:05] <dialman> Running "compare_size:files" (compare_size) task
[20:51:05] <dialman> >> CreateProcessW: The system cannot find the file specified.
[20:51:16] <dialman> Can anyone either help or direct me somewhere that can?
[20:56:25] <ajpiano> dialman: did you npm install
[20:57:18] <dialman> npm install grunt and npm install -g grunt as well (as admin)
[20:57:27] <ajpiano> yea but you also have to run "npm install"
[20:57:41] <ajpiano> inside of ~/path/to/jquery
[20:57:44] <ajpiano> to install the rest of the deps
[20:58:14] <dialman> Ayup, did that
[20:58:25] <ajpiano> and you're still getting the error about compare_sizes?
[20:59:01] <dialman> Yep, I *see* a file, which I assume is the one it's attempting to reference: ~\node_modules\grunt-compare-size\tasks\compare-size.js
[21:00:01] <ajpiano> hmm, strange
[21:00:15] <ajpiano> i just got that far on windows and doing npm install got me further
[21:00:18] <ajpiano> but beyond that, i'm not sure
[21:00:39] <dialman> Hehe
[21:00:57] <dialman> Perhaps time to switch over to my ubuntu partition
[21:00:59] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin works on windows though so ostensibly it works
[21:01:14] <ajpiano> hang around here and someone should be able to help you out
[21:01:23] <ajpiano> over the next day or so, i'd imagine
[21:01:46] <dialman> Nifty, thanks. I'd like to start contributing.
[21:02:18] <dialman> As far as that goes, can I just grab an unassigned/open bug and get going?
[21:02:46] <ajpiano> that works
[21:02:58] <ajpiano> might want to shout a holler on the bug that you're planning to take a crack at it
[21:03:54] <ajpiano> and once you have a PR ready, be ready for spirited discussion around it
[21:04:01] <ajpiano> hang around here though in general and you should be alright
[21:05:12] <dialman> Sounds good.
[21:10:01] <ajpiano> looking forward to seeing you around :)
