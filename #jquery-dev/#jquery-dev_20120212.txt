[12:29:45] <prometh> is the jquery chain FASTER or just "better" cuz things can be merged into 1 line of code?
[12:29:59] <prometh> i can't seem to find any documentation on WHY one would want to use the chain
[12:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> prometh: That's a question for #jquery
[12:48:46] <prometh> i figured you guys would want to know in case you'd like to add such to the docs
[12:49:34] <prometh> i got my answer in #jquery, though, yeah :)
[13:09:42] <gf3> prometh: it is convenient and easy to understand
[13:10:15] <prometh> yeah, but not any more efficient than using a variable and starting over with a new jquery line
[13:10:24] <prometh> i'm anal about efficiency
[13:10:51] <gf3> if you're anal about efficiency then why are you using jQuery?
[13:10:55] <prometh> i knew you'd say that.
[13:11:00] <prometh> there is some give.
[13:11:12] <gf3> sounds silly
[13:11:12] <prometh> anal, yet compromising
[13:11:15] <prometh> meh
[13:11:20] <prometh> why waste cpu cycles?
[13:11:44] <gf3> chain vs. var makes no difference
[13:11:50] <prometh> hence the question
[13:11:55] <gf3> compared to something like not using jquery
[13:12:04] <gf3> your bottleneck will never be there..
[13:12:24] <gf3> it'll almost always be your DOM interaction or networking
[13:12:46] <prometh> well, i thought perhaps you guys would be interested in letting your audience know what is more efficient and what is irrelegant
[13:12:50] <prometh> irrelevant
[13:13:10] <prometh> hmm... irrelevant is the wrong word
[13:13:22] <prometh> "isn't"
[13:13:25] <gf3> it really doesn't matter because that kind of change will not affect your app
[13:13:36] <prometh> it could the more and more code that is added
[13:13:54] <prometh> those saved cpu cycles could be used on more important, very intensive things, like rendering
[13:13:58] <gf3> simply "breaking" the chain will not make it quicker
[13:14:11] <gf3> it will _always_ be something else
[13:14:16] <gf3> Guaranteedâ„¢
[13:14:16] <prometh> yes, but it's not slower either.... so, no reason to try so hard to keep everything to one line
[13:14:33] <prometh> like i was doing
[13:14:49] <gf3> dude, you are not wasting CPU cycles by chaining
[13:15:01] <prometh> you're not understanding me
[13:15:06] <gf3> you're wasting CPU cycles by doing silly things like custom CSS selectors, etc...
[13:15:15] <prometh> i was trying to chain everything, thinking that it was faster
[13:15:31] <gf3> chain or don't chain, that's personal preference
[13:15:38] <prometh> well, that's what i was asking
[13:15:41] <gf3> it won't make a difference
[13:15:50] <prometh> i think people should know that there's no performance boost
[13:16:00] <gf3> I don't think people care?
[13:16:16] <prometh> well, i do
[13:17:10] <gf3> there are so many more important things that could affect one's app
[13:17:17] <prometh> and i focus on those too
[13:17:29] <gf3> chaining is just a convenient way of grouping related actions
[13:17:35] <prometh> i did not know this
[13:17:45] <prometh> i thought there was also a performance boost
[13:17:49] <gf3> well you just leveled up
[13:17:57] <prometh> great, but what about the others?
[13:18:15] <prometh> the reason i mentioned it here was in hopes that it would level you guys up too
[13:18:20] <prometh> yeah yeah "it didn't
[13:18:37] <prometh> but with that level up, perhaps you'd update the docs for otehrs like me
[13:19:46] <kswedberg> prometh: where exactly in the docs do you think we should say, "by the way, chaining does not provide a performance boost"?
[13:20:01] <prometh> i don't know, that's not my "job"
[13:20:33] <prometh> how about "While not giving a performance boost of any kind, chaining can save you loads of time. Check this shit out:"
[13:21:25] <kswedberg> prometh: I know it's not your "job," but you're the one suggesting we put it somewhere.
[13:21:32] <prometh> ^ :)
[13:21:34] <gf3> prometh: http://jsperf.com/chain-vs-no-chain
[13:22:00] <prometh> heh... 45 seconds ago.. thanks :)
[13:22:03] <kswedberg> Yeah, but where? It seems like an answer in search of a question.
[13:22:04] <prometh> now, for google to pick that up
[13:22:55] <gf3> IMHO it's not important enough to note
[13:22:56] <prometh> kswedberg: i don't know.. that part's not up to me
[13:23:03] <gf3> no offence prometh
[13:23:09] <prometh> gf3: fair enough... i thought it was
[13:23:11] <kswedberg> gf3: +1
[13:23:19] <danzik17> just write what's correct and readable imho.  it doesn't make sense to go to the extreme of "im gonna chain everything" or "never chain anything!"
[13:26:29] <kswedberg> prometh: it might be nice to discuss something like that in a blog post somewhere, but there's no place for it in the API documentation.
[13:27:05] <prometh> ok.. i just think it's good to know why things were created
[13:27:53] <prometh> that way i know how to better apply them
[13:40:10] <kswedberg> and now you know. :)
[13:40:57] <prometh> but what about everyone else?
[13:41:10] <prometh> anyway... the jsperf gf3 created will do just fine once google finds it
[13:41:23] <prometh> i searched for that exact string: "jquery chain vs no chain"
[20:00:49] <kborchers> ?down api.jquery.com
[20:00:56] <bot-t> kborchers, It's not just you! - http://api.jquery.com looks down from here.
[20:01:13] <kborchers> danheberden, ajpiano ^^ !
[20:20:03] <vladikoff> kborchers, yeah i pinged them earlier , no luck
[20:20:16] <kborchers> :(
[23:22:33] <danheberden> kborchers yeah, it had a problem and they took it down, but like - no info
