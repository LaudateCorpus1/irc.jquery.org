[11:45:38] <DaveMethvin> timmywil thanks for the cleanup on the tickets ... were you going to work on release script?
[11:46:27] <timmywil> I was just in the middle of finishing up the build option to remove the global. I should have time to work on the release script after that.
[11:46:39] <DaveMethvin> awesome, thanks!
[11:46:47] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: do you think we should skip the exposure for Browserify?
[11:47:03] <DaveMethvin> i think so based on the feedback we got
[11:47:07] <timmywil> we could use the same check we use to see if there is a global window with a document
[11:47:09] <DaveMethvin> it's easy for someone to add a global back
[11:47:55] <DaveMethvin> it's a beta, so if we get it wrong i hope we'll hear some complaints :)
[11:48:17] <timmywil> what do you think of removing $.noConflict if doing -exports/global?
[11:48:46] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[11:48:59] <timmywil> basically, I just put the exposure in its own file, along with the vars to save the previous values of $ and jQuery and $.noConflict
[11:49:38] <timmywil> if there's no exposure, it does nothing
[11:49:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah, that's a clean way to do it!
[11:50:00] <timmywil> cool

[13:11:15] <Krinkle> rxaviers: relative date would be done by moment.js, right?
[13:11:36] <Krinkle> primarily just the time-ago/from-now formatting
[13:12:30] <Krinkle> and ability to parse differnet timestamp formats (since we have quite a few different formats in the wild to deal with right now on the client-side, though working on moving it all to iso, which old browsers don't parse well using built-in Date) 
[13:13:28] <Krinkle> most common are: unix time, ISO and 14 long mw-format (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS)
[13:14:01] <Krinkle> a third major one, though currently momentjs doesn't support that I think, is dealing with timezones.
[13:14:18] <Krinkle> It is particulary hard to use a timezone other than the one the user browser has.
[13:14:52] <Krinkle> e.g. display timestamp YYYYMMDDHHMMSS as "Month day, HH:II" according to UTC +4:00 (users account timezone) in user's language.
[13:15:13] * Krinkle wraps in email reply
[13:50:37] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: The test fails we are getting in the data module are due to a prompt the test throws about Java being out of date. Is Java supposed to be installed at all? Is that something the BrowserStack guys can remove?
[13:57:58] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Are we getting them through testswarm or when you're testing manually?
[13:58:28] <Krinkle> The IE6/IE7 data module failures?
[13:58:31] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2165
[13:58:32] <DaveMethvin> i do not know, i tested locally and got it
[13:58:43] <Krinkle> within the vm or on your own system?
[13:58:56] <Krinkle> (the java alert)
[13:58:57] <DaveMethvin> inside browserstack, running from my localhost
[13:59:21] <Krinkle> Becuase i got a OSX java update thing whenever I open a browserstack vm
[13:59:39] <DaveMethvin> no this is an alert from the bs window, not my own system
[13:59:40] <Krinkle> they trigger it somehow but it's on my system, not affecting the tests
[13:59:48] <DaveMethvin> and it happens about halfway into the test
[14:00:02] <DaveMethvin> which matches behaviorally what we're seeing there
[14:00:08] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: OK, which os/browser/version and which test are you using to reproduce it on browerstack live?
[14:00:25] <DaveMethvin> ie7, the data module
[14:00:54] <Krinkle> http://builds.jenkins.jquery.com/jquery/36c3f32f00e016f71a54a73fc9e46b6fa298f491/test/index.html?module=data
[14:00:59] <Krinkle> OK, winXP/IE7
[14:01:07] <Krinkle> checking, will report in the browserstack feedback loop
[14:06:38] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Got it, thanks. http://cl.ly/image/0Y2F2d363r1g
[14:06:58] <DaveMethvin> yup that's it
[14:54:45] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez, DaveMethvin: Release._getVersions is all wrong for core.
[14:55:34] <timmywil> Perhaps we could specify versions on the command line, but I'm wondering why UI and mobile haven't adopted semver formatting yet
[14:55:58] <scott_gonzalez> What are you talking about? We do have semver.
[14:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> We've had it for a long time.
[14:56:11] <DaveMethvin> timmywil can you point to the code?
[14:57:03] <timmywil> 1.2.3pre should be 1.2.3-pre
[14:57:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, we do that on purpose actually.
[14:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> You should never release a "pre" version.
[14:57:39] <scott_gonzalez> So we don't follow the normal convention.
[14:58:52] <scott_gonzalez> So by "all wrong" do you just mean that it doesn't handle "-pre"?
[14:59:35] <timmywil> Sort of. All of the versions it generated were wrong because of the -pre format.
[14:59:59] <timmywil> For instance, it wants to release "2.1.0-"
[15:00:13] <scott_gonzalez> We can make it support -pre, but if I remember correctly, when I tested this like a year ago, using 1.2.3pre prevented publishing, which we viewed as a plus.
[15:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> Either way, we should be consistent. So either sticking with the invalid pre, or using a valid, but never actually published -pre.
[15:01:15] <DaveMethvin> i can see the value of the "feature" that the pre version is not semver
[15:01:17] <scott_gonzalez> -pre will also sort above alpha band beta.
[15:01:18] <DaveMethvin> so i'm okay with that
[15:01:19] <timmywil> Fair enough. Maybe core should switch back.
[15:01:56] <DaveMethvin> we just need to change the current versions to "pre" vs "-pre" before running the script i guess?
[15:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[15:02:27] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you ok with that?
[15:02:35] <timmywil> I can include it in my patches
[15:02:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah that sounds good
[15:02:44] <timmywil> ok
[15:02:52] <timmywil> one step closer then
[15:02:56] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[15:03:51] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: does jquery-release update the version in bower.json?
[15:07:01] <timmywil> I'll find out
[15:11:39] <DaveMethvin> gotta reboot but I'll be back

[15:36:43] <scott_gonzalez> There's a fair amount that's not implemented yet.
[15:42:37] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: are you wanting to get beta3 out tonight?
[15:43:03] <DaveMethvin> timmywil we can hold up a bit if you have more to do
[15:43:10] <DaveMethvin> i still need to write the blog post
[15:43:25] <DaveMethvin> whoa it's 7pm already
[15:43:37] <DaveMethvin> HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?!
[15:43:49] <timmywil> I have a dinner to go to so I can't work on it more tonight, but I'm available more during the day tomorrow
[15:44:03] <DaveMethvin> ok sounds good, i'll do the blog post in teh meantime
[15:44:10] <timmywil> I have it creating a beautiful tag
[15:44:16] <timmywil> but there's a quite a bit to do
[15:44:29] <timmywil> and I'm not sure jquery-release is actually set up to do beta releases
[15:44:29] <DaveMethvin> i think you could actually do this release if you want 
[15:44:48] <DaveMethvin> it's a beta, we are entitled to screw it up all we want
[15:44:53] <DaveMethvin> and bame scott_gonzalez
[15:45:14] <timmywil> that's true! there will be no lack of finger-pointing.
[15:45:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah i have to run as well, didn't realize it was so late
[15:45:21] <DaveMethvin> lo
[15:45:23] <DaveMethvin> lol
[15:45:31] <DaveMethvin> ok we'll regroup tomorrow
[15:45:34] <DaveMethvin> have a great dinner
[15:45:40] <timmywil> sounds good. have a good night
[15:46:08] <timmywil> oh, I take it back though. It can do betas.
[15:46:14] <timmywil> hooray!
[15:46:27] <timmywil> ok, cyl
[16:00:21] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell timmywil It supports beta releases, but I wouldn't suggest using it right now as it's known to be buggy (based on the Mobile release).
[16:00:21] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: I’ll tell timmywil about that.
