[00:18:25] <ajpiano> sorry for all the e-mails
[00:18:30] <ajpiano> if anyone's here
[00:36:07] <ajpiano> bot-t: tell rwaldron http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8961
[00:36:08] <bot-t> ajpiano, Okay.
[02:17:20] <martin-g> hi! at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ the doc entry for 'xhr' setting says "Default:Â ActiveXObject when available (IE), the XMLHttpRequest otherwise"
[02:17:40] <martin-g> does that mean that even IE9/10 use ActiveXObject instead of XMLHttpRequest ?
[03:48:16] <warden23> http://pastebin.parentnode.org/104245 <- works.. but I want the button that is clicked to be a certain colour (showing that it is selected) so I tried http://pastebin.parentnode.org/104246 <- notice line 13, line 17 and line 22 are all I changed.. any help is welcome, cheers))
[03:49:21] <skamikaze> warden23: support in #jquery :)
[03:50:50] <warden23> ok thx
[04:43:56] <jzaefferer> since when does outerWidth work as a setter? why isn't that documented?
[05:08:19] <addyosmani> jzaefferer: weird.
[05:08:40] <addyosmani> unless there wasn't a desire for it to be documented for some reason (Dave probably has some more insights into that), feel free to open up a ticket for it.
[05:08:48] <addyosmani> One of us will make sure docs get written.
[05:32:48] <mikesherov> gibson042: did you submit a bug report yet?
[05:37:04] <gibson042> mikesherov: the real-number bug won't be there until PR 610 lands... 1.7.1 still catches ints and reals with rnum = /^-?\d/
[05:38:10] <mikesherov> gison042: add a ticket first, then I can add unit tests for your specific situation and fix both bugs with the PR
[05:38:24] <gibson042> mikesherov: ok; will do
[05:38:51] <mikesherov> It may seem like busy work, but every ticket needs a bug report, so it can get mentioned in the release notes.
[06:21:43] <miketaylr> someone accidentally the jquery 1.2 xpath compat plugin, http://plugins.jquery.com/project/xpath
[06:34:12] <timmywil> miketaylr: i think you're missing a verb there

[06:35:29] <timmywil> heh ok
[06:35:35] <timmywil> you got me

[06:40:03] <timmywil> jqueries
[06:40:21] <timmywil> too bad it was deleted
[06:44:26] <DaveMethvin> oh sorry timmywil didn't think of jqueries
[06:44:44] <timmywil> heh, that's alright
[06:44:59] <DaveMethvin> and for the record, I rarely  have nosebleeds
[06:46:44] <jzaefferer> ?tell addyosmani nevermind, its just in jQuery UI
[06:46:44] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[06:47:44] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i only have them once a day or so
[06:47:50] <DaveMethvin> lol
[07:38:17] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you sent the google email ya?
[07:38:25] <DaveMethvin> yep
[07:38:28] <DaveMethvin> they acked
[07:38:34] <DaveMethvin> and the ms one too
[07:38:42] <timmywil> cool

[07:44:39] <rwaldron> ajpiano ?
[07:45:11] <rwaldron> are you trying to show me that my request for references was dutifully fulfilled?
[07:45:13] <rwaldron> good for them
[07:45:20] <rwaldron> apparently they waited too long
[08:41:56] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: looks great
[08:42:04] <timmywil> needs more unicorns
[08:42:26] <DaveMethvin> hmmmm...
[09:35:55] <rwaldron> .
[09:54:33] <DaveMethvin> .
[10:19:48] <ryanneufeld> .
[10:27:48] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: you ready for another tweet? I'm about to put up the call for 1.8 suggestions
[10:27:57] <ajpiano> i was born ready
[10:28:03] <DaveMethvin> wow
[10:28:05] <ajpiano> but then had to wait a long time for twitter to be invented
[10:28:29] <DaveMethvin> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/22/call-for-jquery-1-8-ideas/
[10:37:13] <DaveMethvin> thanks ajpiano
[10:37:17] <ajpiano> np
[10:37:53] <timmywil> twitter's loading really slowly for me too
[10:40:31] <DaveMethvin> yep, on the verge of a fail whale i suspect
[10:54:11] <ajpiano> rwaldron: did you see that ticket i linked last night
[10:54:25] <ajpiano> yes you did
[10:55:04] <ajpiano> trac-o-bot is not a binding contract
[10:56:33] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: thoughts?
[10:56:55] <DaveMethvin> trac-o-bot is sometimes wrong
[10:57:03] <DaveMethvin> we won't insult him by reversing his decision
[10:57:08] <ajpiano> exactly
[10:57:12] <rwaldron> huh?
[10:57:14] <DaveMethvin> so what are we talking about?
[10:57:19] <timmywil> ajpiano: you ninja'd me http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/GaWdM/
[10:57:19] <ajpiano> ?8961
[10:57:21] <bot-t> [#8961]  (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/8961
[10:57:24] <rwaldron> so, re-open?
[10:57:31] <ajpiano> seems like it
[10:57:31] <rwaldron> why do you need me to re-open?
[10:57:42] <rwaldron> want me to hold it for you while you peee?
[10:57:57] <ajpiano> OVERREACT MUCH
[10:57:59] <ajpiano> :D
[10:58:25] <DaveMethvin> well I always thought that get requests could not  have a body
[10:58:27] <ajpiano> my ACTUAL thought was that you could reopen it and be like HELLO LOOK I MYSELF WAS CONSCIENTIOUSLY REVIEWING AN OLD ISSUE AND NOTICED YOUR COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION, USER
[10:58:41] <DaveMethvin> but if the spec says they can then we should either fix or close wontfix
[10:58:52] <DaveMethvin> this sounds like a jaubourg to me
[10:59:05] <ajpiano> bazickly
[10:59:19] <ajpiano> timmywil: you have no idea how fast i was working to file that
[10:59:28] <ajpiano> i knew i was either going to ninja or get ninja'd
[10:59:30] <timmywil> heh, bazickly
[10:59:38] <DaveMethvin> of course i say that because jauborg isn't here
[10:59:54] <timmywil> i even had a link to the combinator in the selectors spec and everything
[11:01:18] <rwaldron> ajpiano i'm the picture of calm right now
[11:01:25] <rwaldron> you're the one typing in caps
[11:01:27] <rwaldron> https://gist.github.com/1386354
[11:01:32] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ajpiano ^
[11:01:55] <ajpiano> rwaldron: i use caps instead of quotes
[11:01:57] <ajpiano> duhhhhh
[11:02:12] <DaveMethvin> yo dawg i herd you like [Subject] so ...
[11:02:16] <rwaldron> ahahahah
[11:02:27] <skamikaze> rwaldron: lol :)
[11:02:46] <rwaldron> I'd like to encourage people to re-write in other languages and take crash-shots
[11:07:58] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin on the 1.8 form, bugs.jquery.com isn't a link
[11:08:18] <DaveMethvin> true, let me change that
[11:23:47] <rwaldron> uhhh ohhh
[11:23:59] <rwaldron> ajpiano in HTML5 "anything" can be in an ID
[11:24:12] <rwaldron> so...
[11:24:39] <ajpiano> ?
[11:24:47] <rwaldron> document.querySelectorAll("#whoops+.imanidiot")
[11:24:53] <rwaldron> :(
[11:25:08] <ajpiano> right?
[11:25:31] <rwaldron> you closed the ticket as invalid no?
[11:25:43] <ajpiano> it's invalid because we have \\
[11:25:46] <ajpiano> and if you have that as an id
[11:25:47] <DaveMethvin> you gotta escapey those thangs
[11:25:56] <rwaldron> oh, i know
[11:26:01] <rwaldron> but i'm sayiiin'
[11:26:09] <rwaldron> i think that's valid as is?
[11:26:21] <ajpiano> you can do $("#whoops\\+\\.imanidiot")
[11:26:21] * rwaldron wants to be wrong
[11:26:28] <ajpiano> it's 'valid' per spec
[11:26:29] <rwaldron> yeah, i know
[11:26:33] <ajpiano> but it's not going to work in jquery
[11:26:37] <ajpiano> thus we have espacing
[11:26:39] <rwaldron> right right
[11:26:44] <DaveMethvin> you'd have to escape it in a css selector as well
[11:27:21] <ajpiano> i want to see the rest of that dom too
[11:27:29] <ajpiano> $("#dang\\+\\.imanidiot")
[11:27:40] <ajpiano> meh, moron
[11:27:41] <ajpiano> #jokefail

[11:29:27] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/q5ZZW/
[11:29:37] <rwaldron> mother-effing-sad-face
[11:30:05] <DaveMethvin> why?
[11:30:24] <rwaldron> just that it's inconsistent
[11:30:30] <rwaldron> but the inconsistency makes sense
[11:30:34] <paul_irish> files are waiting for approval to go to the CDN
[11:30:42] <DaveMethvin> i mean, qSA uses CSS selector rules, and gEBI uses just an id string
[11:30:44] <DaveMethvin> thanks paul_irish
[11:30:46] <rwaldron> one accepts "selector" and the other not
[11:30:58] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yes, right ^^
[11:31:01] <rwaldron> ;)
[11:31:16] <DaveMethvin> btw rwaldron you can't put links in a google form caption for a field it seems
[11:31:27] <rwaldron> no shit huh?
[11:31:29] <rwaldron> crazy
[11:31:33] <rwaldron> thanks for trying
[11:32:09] <timmywil> rwaldron: yes, getElementById will be fine because no parsing is required
[11:33:23] <timmywil> or are we arguing something else
[11:34:28] <timmywil> there's absolutely no way to know that it is meant to be a '+' character and not an adjacent combinator unless it is escaped
[11:39:33] <DaveMethvin> sure there is, any time we see a # we should find the nearest chunker break character on the right and see if that  substring matches an id, and keep going adding chunks and seeing if they are a valid id, Etc. Problem solved. :P
[11:39:55] <timmywil> oh perfect
[11:40:02] <DaveMethvin> believe it or not, that is the way Microsoft determines where to break file names
[11:40:04] <miketaylr> ?tell jaubourg is http://code.google.com/p/jquery-jsonp/ still maintained?
[11:40:04] <bot-t> miketaylr, Okay.
[11:40:18] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682425(v=vs.85).aspx
[11:40:27] <DaveMethvin> look at lpApplicationName
[11:40:29] <DaveMethvin> i kid you not
[11:40:56] <timmywil> sweeeet
[11:41:00] <DaveMethvin> now THERE'S some reliable softwares
[11:41:29] <timmywil> still, then I couldn't use the combinator if my ID has a +
[11:42:21] <timmywil> $('#a++++.b') Why doesn't this work!?
[11:42:50] <DaveMethvin> must be those nosebleed developers
[11:42:51] <timmywil> obviously, jQuery sucks
[11:42:54] <timmywil> ^^
[11:42:55] <timmywil> haha
[11:44:31] <ryanneufeld> ?cc @ timmywil
[11:44:31] <bot-t> timmywil, CASE CLOASED >: |
[11:45:28] <timmywil> man, you know what jQuery needs
[11:45:35] <DaveMethvin> unicorns?
[11:45:36] <timmywil> more lolcat methods
[11:45:40] <DaveMethvin> YEAH!
[11:45:45] <DaveMethvin> i was just ... oh yeah
[11:46:11] <timmywil> someone should suggest that
[11:46:20] <timmywil> oh wait!
[11:47:16] <timmywil> interesting.  all 3 so far concern ajax
[11:47:25] <timmywil> MOAR
[11:47:29] <timmywil> MOAR AJAX
[11:47:30] <DaveMethvin> well that file upload will be PLUGIN for sure
[11:47:41] <timmywil> yes
[11:47:55] <DaveMethvin> Coming Soon: The Ajax That Ate The Code Base
[11:48:27] <DaveMethvin> exposing XHR2 is a good point, i still wonder if we shoudl head a completely different direction with that
[11:48:44] <DaveMethvin> i mean, if you write your own xhr it's like 20 lines at most
[11:49:01] <DaveMethvin> but then we get all these special cases and pretty soon we have $.ajax
[11:49:44] <timmywil> perhaps
[11:50:08] <timmywil> $.ajax deprectaed
[11:50:24] <DaveMethvin> $.xhr, $.jsonp
[11:51:16] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin docs#10863
[11:51:18] <bot-t> [#10863] .data method does not return an object if the JSON string contains newlines. (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/10863
[11:51:39] <rwaldron> timmywil are newline chars even valid in attribute values?
[11:51:49] <DaveMethvin> i believe they are
[11:51:57] <DaveMethvin> they are valid in json fer sure
[11:52:07] <timmywil> yea they're pretty much valid everywhere
[11:52:28] <timmywil> they have to be escaped to be ignored
[11:53:37] <timmywil> there are exceptions like ID, which can't contain any "space characters"
[11:54:43] <rwaldron> i feel like i read otherwise in a spec
[11:54:49] <rwaldron> but i'll take your word for it
[11:55:47] <rwaldron> what the hell is up with everyone passing undefined to everything
[11:56:21] <timmywil> you can even have newlines in selectors
[11:57:03] <timmywil> http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors4/#structure crrrazy
[11:57:11] <rwaldron> i meant attribute values
[11:57:18] <rwaldron> but like i said, I'll take your word
[11:57:26] <timmywil> yea, it's even more surprising to me for selectors
[11:57:29] <rwaldron> considering the amount of time you've spent working on attributes
[11:57:59] <rpflo> rwaldron: I saw it in the jQuery source, so now I do it everywhere I can.
[11:58:10] <rwaldron> saw what?
[11:58:19] <rpflo> passing undefined all over
[11:58:51] <rwaldron> :\
[11:59:26] <rwaldron> timmywil where is the spreadsheet for 1.8 requests?
[11:59:29] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^
[11:59:38] <timmywil> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj5JJFjq9rZDdDQxd2Q4NDdCTUNqREwwaGRPZEE1enc#gid=0
[11:59:42] <rwaldron> thank you sir
[11:59:48] <timmywil> np
[12:00:57] <rwaldron> timmywil DaveMethvin things that are in trac, marked as 1.8-discuss already... we dont need to add those to the spreadsheet do we?
[12:01:07] <rwaldron> the spreadsheet will be imported to trac, right?
[12:01:15] <timmywil> i would hope so
[12:01:26] <timmywil> to the 2nd question
[12:01:42] <rwaldron> that's what we did last time
[12:02:00] <timmywil> yea, I just figured we would do that
[12:02:18] <ryanneufeld> OH, can you guys add for 1.8 the .dwim() function?
[12:02:28] <ryanneufeld> j/k
[12:02:37] <ryanneufeld> unless you're gonna do it
[12:02:45] <timmywil> dwim?
[12:02:50] <rwaldron> "do what i mean"?
[12:02:56] <timmywil> ah
[12:03:00] <rwaldron> just a guess
[12:03:27] <rwaldron> I think we should stop listening to all the "turn jQuery into modules" chatter
[12:03:36] <rwaldron> there i said it
[12:03:45] <rwaldron> jsut because 5 people want it
[12:03:54] <rwaldron> doesnt mean the other 26.6 million do
[12:04:07] <ryanneufeld> I don't think it's big enough to justify it
[12:04:07] <rwaldron> brb
[12:04:32] <rwaldron> agreed
[12:04:38] <rwaldron> brb for real this time
[12:06:39] <ajpiano> do we need to go through and add stuff we know is already 1.8-discuss to this form
[12:06:49] <ajpiano> or shoudl we just let community stuff come into here
[12:07:49] <timmywil> I don't think it's necessary.  We'll port it the community requests to tickets.
[12:07:55] <timmywil> -it
[12:08:13] <ajpiano> yeah, struck me as a redundant duplication
[12:08:20] <ajpiano> ?dyswidt
[12:08:20] <bot-t> did you see what i did thereâ½
[12:08:34] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: confirm or die
[12:09:12] <timmywil> cake or...
[12:16:57] <DaveMethvin> timmywil rwaldron yes we can distill the sane suggestions to tickets for voting
[12:17:35] <DaveMethvin> on the modules front I thought some people did testing and found that it doesn't really help loading time
[12:17:45] <DaveMethvin> i seem to recall a blog post a few months back
[12:17:50] <DaveMethvin> by someone
[12:18:36] <DaveMethvin> and it makes sense that it wouldn't help ... i can see it being useful but only if you designed the app to understand it was being progressively loaded from the ground up
[12:18:46] <DaveMethvin> and most ppl don't take the time to do that
[12:41:39] <ryanneufeld> Why not keep .tmpl() alive in future versions?
[12:43:34] <ajpiano> cause we never every maintained it
[12:43:54] <ajpiano> to begin with
[12:43:56] <ajpiano> it never was alive
[12:43:57] <ryanneufeld> That's my point
[12:44:04] <ryanneufeld> make it alive?
[12:44:15] <ajpiano> in core?
[12:44:28] <ryanneufeld> if it's small enough
[12:44:48] <ajpiano> it isn't
[12:45:01] <rwaldron> ajpiano what version of node do you have?
[12:45:21] <ajpiano> 0.4.8
[12:45:29] <rwaldron> fffffuuuuuuu
[12:45:35] <ajpiano> why
[12:45:42] <ajpiano> stuff being weird on 0.6?
[12:45:47] <rwaldron> i have 0.6.0 and can't build jQuery anymore
[12:45:55] <ajpiano> whats workn't
[12:46:05] <rwaldron> "workn't" hahaha
[12:46:18] <rwaldron> it throw exceptions at jslint-check.js
[12:46:27] <rwaldron> L24
[12:46:45] <rwaldron> throws*
[12:46:54] <rwaldron> shit
[12:47:13] <rwaldron> i cant fix this because mike has an outstanding PR to move over to jshint
[12:47:34] <ajpiano> do you have nave
[12:47:56] <ajpiano> https://github.com/isaacs/nave
[13:20:20] <rwaldron> ajpiano nope
[13:20:22] <rwaldron> looking
[13:20:45] <ajpiano> i don't use it, i still have nvm chillin - gotta switch
[13:20:55] <ajpiano> but i feel like something like one of those two could help
[13:21:03] <rwaldron> looks like it
[13:22:25] <rwaldron> i really love npm
[13:25:15] <iPaintCode> @rwaldron you using the npm brew install or just straight install
[14:08:23] <Krinkle> anyone here know what's behind http://api.jquery.com/api/ ? Is it cached ? It seems a bit slow (Chrome brings up a kill/wait alert). I know it's 1.06 MB, but the way it comes it makes me think the slowdown is server side parsing not downloading
[14:09:29] <paul_irish> i wget'd it in 600ms
[14:09:49] <paul_irish> *on the worlds fastest internet connection
[14:09:52] <paul_irish> :p
[14:10:00] <Krinkle> k, took about 10 seconds here
[14:10:02] <iPaintCode> I haven't got the kill wait alert in chrome for months (oh boy here comes the kills now)
[14:10:21] <Krinkle> Oh, when I finally managed to scroll down I see a WP W3 Total Cache comment
[14:10:33] <Krinkle> well then
[14:10:41] <Krinkle> ?cc
[14:10:42] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[14:11:09] <Krinkle> iPaintCode: yeah, haven't had it in a while either. hence the suspicion
[14:11:30] <Krinkle> wow, it includes all plugins ?
[14:11:39] <paul_irish> just some
[14:11:45] <paul_irish> the ones documented on the site
[14:11:59] <Krinkle> yeah, sure.
[14:12:40] <Krinkle> I was about to start a jQueryLint/Hint/good practices nag thingy, then found padolsey's existing lint on github.
[14:12:54] <Krinkle> shortly after found his PHP script to feed the lint, which mentioned this api.
[14:12:59] <paul_irish> Krinkle: you should talk to him about taking over maintainership of it
[14:13:06] <paul_irish> or.. collaborating
[14:13:12] <paul_irish> depending on his avail time
[14:13:21] <Krinkle> I have some ideas, yeah
[14:13:39] <Krinkle> some ideas here as well: http://markmail.org/message/wzkosk2s5jklpkv4
[14:13:59] <Krinkle> other things are like nagging for use of .size() and improper use of .attr() vs. prop()
[14:15:15] <Krinkle> however there's a fundamental difference between padolsey's approach and the approach I originally planned to take (now that I know his I like his in a way too). Mine was scanning of code (instead of running it and overloading jQuery methods and using __defineGetter__ etc. )
[14:15:37] <Krinkle> things I wanted to look for is like empty().html( .. ) or .css( .. ).css( .. )
[14:15:55] <Krinkle> not impossible from code itself, but easier when scanning
[14:16:20] <Krinkle> something like last_called_method, although that can get messy with jQuery calling itself internally
[14:16:43] <Krinkle> paul_irish: Do you know him ?
[14:17:15] <paul_irish> yup
[14:17:59] <paul_irish> static analysis will probably be too messy
[14:18:31] <paul_irish> it's hard.
[14:19:42] <Krinkle> yeah, which is why I liked his approach a lot, hand't considered it really.
[14:21:39] <ajpiano> i wonder if ben_alman_ 's new thing would be useful for this kind of stuff
[14:21:39] <ajpiano> https://github.com/cowboy/javascript-hooker
[14:22:05] <ajpiano> someone also commented on the 1.8 blog post talking about having a debug mode/linting tool would be sweet
[14:22:55] <Krinkle> Hm.. I had to build an "inject spy" function once myself, I'm not sure which edge cases I missed, but is it complicated enough to do right for there to be a library for it ?
[14:22:56] <danzik17> ajpiano: oh how i wish i had know he was doing that a few weeks ago :(
[14:23:10] * Krinkle checks out js-hooker
[14:23:32] <ajpiano> ben_alman_: has been going OD on that thing lately
[14:36:00] <ben_alman_> hi
[14:36:02] <ajpiano> Krinkle: http://jsfiddle.net/Z7Pj6/1/
[14:36:20] <ben_alman_> yeah this can be used to spy
[14:36:33] <ben_alman_> and you can hook all methods of an object
[14:36:41] <ben_alman_> just by passing in the object
[14:37:03] <ajpiano> ben_alman_: that was surprisingly enjoyable to use
[14:37:09] <ben_alman_> what was
[14:37:17] <ajpiano> hooker
[14:37:19] <ben_alman_> oh ok
[14:37:20] <ajpiano> check that fiddle
[14:37:25] <ben_alman_> suprisingly?
[14:37:27] <ben_alman_> heh
[14:37:36] <ajpiano> not because i expected it to be unpleasant
[14:37:40] <ajpiano> but i didn't expect it to be that pleasant
[14:39:11] <Krinkle> ben_alman_: before I go through and read all the code or actually try it, does your js-hooker work properly for constructors ?
[14:39:17] <Krinkle> i.e. spying new Foo() ?
[14:39:25] <ben_alman_> doubtful
[14:39:29] <ben_alman_> never tried it
[14:39:44] <Krinkle> it requires some special handling, depending on how you implemented it
[14:39:50] <ben_alman_> certainly
[14:39:57] <ben_alman_> i do nothing with function prototypes
[14:40:06] <ben_alman_> and if i did, un-hooking would break instanceof etc
[14:40:13] <Krinkle> yep
[14:40:30] <Krinkle> hm.. factory functions are a good solution though
[14:40:45] <Krinkle> i.e. hooking jQuery() is easy since that function calls jQuery.fn.init
[14:40:56] <ben_alman_> correct
[14:41:30] <ben_alman_> ajpiano, http://jsfiddle.net/Z7Pj6/2/
[14:41:31] <ben_alman_> fwiw
[14:41:55] <ajpiano> nice, i saw that in the docs
[14:43:13] <ben_alman_> interesting idea to make it work for constructors
[14:44:22] <Krinkle> Hm.. I didn't read until now that you're going OD on that according to ajpiano , I hope this won't keep you awake tonight :P (Must. Have. It. Work. For. Constructors.)
[14:44:36] <Krinkle> please don't, I didn't say a thing
[14:44:42] <ben_alman_> testing now
[14:44:44] <ben_alman_> have an idea
[14:44:48] <Krinkle> oops
[14:44:54] <ben_alman_> hmmn
[14:44:57] <Krinkle> ajpiano: he's already going :P
[14:45:01] <Krinkle> wee
[14:45:03] <Krinkle> awesome!
[14:45:06] <ben_alman_> so the constructor would have to be a property of an object
[14:45:10] <ben_alman_> like window.Foo
[14:45:15] <ben_alman_> and not a free variable Foo
[14:46:01] <Krinkle> ben_alman_: You're thinking of re-defining the global constructor on load time so that instanceof still works ?
[14:46:11] <ben_alman_> no
[14:46:16] <ben_alman_> i don't know what i'm thinking yet
[14:46:19] <Krinkle> ok
[14:46:21] <ben_alman_> other than that this is probably impossible
[14:46:28] <ben_alman_> since you can't use "new" with apply invocation
[14:46:38] <Krinkle> since I'm not sure that works since jQuery assigns itself to .constructor early on
[14:47:26] <Krinkle> ben_alman_: No, you'd have to catch the properties and call new X() as-is.
[14:47:31] <Krinkle> nvm, you still need .apply
[14:49:46] <ben_alman_> i don't see how to do this
[14:49:57] <Krinkle> ben_alman_: stack overflow has a way, but you won't like it
[14:50:06] <ben_alman_> new Function(string) ?
[14:50:10] <Krinkle> no
[14:50:13] <ben_alman_> link?
[14:50:17] <Krinkle> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7667163/use-apply-with-a-function-constructor#answers-header
[14:50:23] <Krinkle> eval, arguments.join()
[14:50:29] <ben_alman_> right
[14:50:40] <ben_alman_> not really practical
[14:51:42] <ben_alman_> but entertaining
[14:51:53] <Krinkle> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1606797/use-of-apply-with-new-operator-is-this-possible
[14:52:43] <ben_alman_> it would cause someone to have to set a flag when hooking
[14:52:47] <Krinkle> you don't need to call originalConstructor with 'new'
[14:52:59] <Krinkle> you just need to give it the right context
[14:53:14] <Krinkle> there's no difference in JS really between foo() and new foo(), other than the context, right ?
[14:53:21] <ben_alman_> yes
[14:53:44] <ben_alman_> new creates an object that's instanceof the constructor function
[14:53:48] <ben_alman_> sets the object's prototype
[14:54:07] <ben_alman_> invokes the consturctur function with that new instance obj as the this value
[14:54:13] <ben_alman_> and then returns it when the function is done
[14:55:13] <Krinkle> that's not impossible to do, so the real problem isn't getting the context / passing the arguments. The problem is hooking into that function while maintaining reference/instanceof comparison to the original constructor.
[14:55:36] <ben_alman_> the problem is in doing it in a way that makes it feel like a worthwhile endeavor
[14:55:39] <ben_alman_> well, my problem at least
[14:55:47] <Krinkle> i.e. Foo (before spy) !== Foo (after spy)
[14:56:28] <Krinkle> it would be cool if JavaScript would be more flexible. i.e. that whatever is in prototype.constructor is what `instanceof` looks at
[14:57:12] <ben_alman_> instanceof tests to see if its right operand's prototype property exists anywhere in the prototype chain of the left operand
[14:57:48] <ben_alman_> so yeah, not what you want
[14:58:58] <Krinkle> window.__defineKeyword__.instanceof = function(left, right) { /* next version of JavaScript ? */
[15:00:19] <Krinkle> anyway, looks like something to put back on the shelf for now (at least for js-hooker)
[15:00:31] <ben_alman_> feel free to submit a pull request
[15:00:37] <Krinkle> hehe
[15:00:50] <ben_alman_> i'm not sure what's worse
[15:01:01] <ben_alman_> when you hear me say "patch welcome"
[15:01:09] <ben_alman_> or when i get the email with your pull request
[15:01:18] <ben_alman_> :)
[15:04:40] <Krinkle> "feature not supported for now" works good enough. if it ain't there, it can't be broken.
[15:08:53] <ryanneufeld> I got brain teaser for you guys
[15:08:55] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ua9wZ/1/
[15:09:09] <ryanneufeld> how the heck can I make that work the way I'm thinking?
[15:09:39] <ryanneufeld> at the moment I can only see a solution which would to be to also bind to the child elements
[15:10:23] <Krinkle> ryanneufeld: what are you thinking ?
[15:10:26] <Krinkle> e.target ?
[15:11:06] <ryanneufeld> well, a clickable 'background'
[15:11:30] <ryanneufeld> so you have a clickable background element, but clicking on any of it's children would not count
[15:11:32] <Krinkle> yeah, either bind to children and stopPropagation, or bind to #clickable and check $(e.target)
[15:12:25] <Krinkle> http://jsfiddle.net/Ua9wZ/2/
[15:12:33] <danzik17> ryanneufeld: so you just want to click anywhere outside of those boxes?
[15:12:54] <ryanneufeld> got it
[15:12:55] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ua9wZ/3/
[15:13:02] <ryanneufeld> Thanks Krinkle
[15:13:27] <ryanneufeld> I think I just made some really old shitty code a bout a bajillion times better
[15:13:45] <Krinkle> awesome
[15:14:08] <Krinkle> which code ?
[15:15:33] <ryanneufeld> skin code
[15:15:38] <ryanneufeld> well what we call skin code
[15:15:44] <ryanneufeld> we have ad products that we call skins
[15:15:51] <ryanneufeld> basically a background takeover
[15:15:55] <Krinkle> ok
[15:16:10] <ryanneufeld> http://www.metrolyrics.com/
[15:16:13] <ryanneufeld> like if you check that out
[15:16:23] <ryanneufeld> you'll probably see a sony walkman background on the page
[15:16:24] <ryanneufeld> it's clickable
[15:16:54] <ryanneufeld> gonna spam a little code here
[15:16:57] <ryanneufeld> .children()
[15:16:57] <ryanneufeld> 		.css('cursor', 'default') //Change cursor for all children of container
[15:16:57] <ryanneufeld> 		.click(function() {
[15:16:59] <ryanneufeld> 			//Don't propagate skin clicks to other elements
[15:17:01] <ryanneufeld> 			no_clickable_bg = true;
[15:17:03] <ryanneufeld> 			setTimeout(function() { no_clickable_bg = false; }, 100);
[15:17:05] <ryanneufeld> 		 });
[15:17:07] <ryanneufeld> thats' what it used to do
[15:17:41] <Krinkle> where is this walkman ?
[15:17:52] <ryanneufeld> do you use addblock?
[15:17:56] <ryanneufeld> *adblock?
[15:18:02] <Krinkle> no
[15:18:20] <ryanneufeld> http://www.metrolyrics.com/dont-stop-believin-glee-cast-version-lyrics-glee-cast.html
[15:18:22] <ryanneufeld> try that?
[15:18:30] <ryanneufeld> may have to refresh once or twice
[15:18:35] <ryanneufeld> you in the US?
[15:18:42] <Krinkle> I get a lightbox ad
[15:18:46] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:18:53] <ryanneufeld> after that
[15:19:27] <ryanneufeld> http://beta.metrolyrics.com/?adid=74&key=48d838d99fba537a952b57a09b75a601
[15:19:33] <ryanneufeld> metrolyrics//metrolyrics
[15:19:45] <ryanneufeld> the background should be a nickleback ad
[15:19:52] <Krinkle> http://i.imgur.com/dIxsk.png
[15:19:59] <ryanneufeld> dang
[15:20:03] <ryanneufeld> try the beta link?
[15:20:06] <ryanneufeld> http://beta.metrolyrics.com/?adid=74&key=48d838d99fba537a952b57a09b75a601
[15:20:08] <ryanneufeld> metrolyrics//metrolyrics
[15:20:35] <Krinkle> yeah got it
[15:21:41] <Krinkle> ml_skin, right ?
[15:23:41] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:23:55] <ryanneufeld> you scoping out our js?
[15:24:12] <Krinkle> nah
[15:24:14] <ryanneufeld> http://beta.metrolyrics.com/js/raw/jquery.ml_skin.js
[15:24:17] <Krinkle> found that
[15:24:27] <ryanneufeld> you found the raw one?
[15:24:28] <ryanneufeld> how?
[15:24:37] <Krinkle> no, not the raw one.
[15:24:44] <ryanneufeld> ah
[15:24:44] <ryanneufeld> k
[15:25:04] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I've got some clever htaccess setup so you get raw/min depending on environment
[15:25:05] <Krinkle> I clicked "Pretty print" in Web Inspector in Chrome
[15:25:09] <ryanneufeld> oic
[15:25:12] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:25:27] <Krinkle> but that doesn't bring any comments :)
[15:25:28] <ryanneufeld> http://beta.metrolyrics.com/js/raw/jquery.ml_skin.js <- might as well look at that one
[15:26:17] <Krinkle> oops ? http://beta.metrolyrics.com/raw/.htaccess
[15:26:36] <Krinkle> like that 404 error
[15:26:59] <ryanneufeld> that's what you should see :p
[15:27:09] <Krinkle> ofc!
[15:27:23] <ryanneufeld> haha
[15:28:37] <ryanneufeld> any way, I didn't write that originally
[15:28:46] <ryanneufeld> but after going over .on() with someone the other day
[15:28:55] <ryanneufeld> I knew there had to be a better way
[15:42:47] <Krinkle> ben_alman_: Hm.. perhaps this is what you meant with "it has to be window.Foo not var Foo" but.. defineGetter on window for the constructor call ?
[15:42:57] <Krinkle> that doesn't provide a post-hook, but it's something
[15:53:33] <Krinkle> ben_alman_: http://i.imgur.com/67HnN.png
[15:58:07] <ben_alman_> is __defineGetter__ supported in all the implementations you care about?
[16:04:35] <ryanneufeld> anyone see any way to improve on this: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ua9wZ/ ?
[16:16:10] <mikesherov> I feel dirty
[16:16:26] <ryanneufeld> oh?

[16:21:45] <ryanneufeld> oh, is that for animating things like % widths?
[16:22:11] <mikesherov_> no, it's to fix this stupid bug on chrome:
[16:22:20] <mikesherov_> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10639
[16:23:34] <ryanneufeld> oh
[16:23:56] <ryanneufeld> well, if it works...
[16:24:14] <mikesherov_> yeah
[16:24:27] <mikesherov_> next I'm going to actually fix the fucking thing IN webkit
[16:24:40] <ryanneufeld> what's you're take on this http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ua9wZ/  ?
[16:25:27] <ryanneufeld> could I do it better?
[16:25:34] <mikesherov_> events over my head at the moment
[16:26:04] <ryanneufeld> no worries
[16:26:09] <ryanneufeld> I gotta run any way
