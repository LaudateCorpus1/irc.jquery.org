[08:23:27] <jq-jenkins> waldron.rick: Update dimensions unit tests from changes in #11604
[08:23:40] <gnarf> that one is a lil scary - known potential BC issue
[08:23:48] <gnarf> shutup jenkins
[08:23:50] <rwaldron> The original, yes
[08:23:55] <rwaldron> but this was just tests
[08:24:02] <rwaldron> i feel comfortable committing tests
[08:24:12] <rwaldron> er "landing"
[10:33:42] <mikesherov> gnarf: WTF
[10:34:12] <gnarf> mikesherov: :/
[10:34:19] <mikesherov> LOL
[10:34:27] <mikesherov> Don't forget I have access to the databse
[10:34:32] <mikesherov> ACCESS MAIN PROGRAM
[10:35:30] <gnarf> mikesherov: would some comment haiku make you feel better? https://gist.github.com/bb4d8fbf36b0d493c698

[13:14:37] <johnkpaul> what version of PHP is supposed to be used to run the jQuery unit tests?
[13:24:40] <rwaldron> johnkpaul whatever version was used in 2008?
[13:24:52] <rwaldron> i dont think there is a special version requirement there
[13:24:58] <rwaldron> its not doing much
[13:25:00] <johnkpaul> yeah, I figured it out
[13:25:05] <johnkpaul> 5.3 works fine
[13:25:09] <johnkpaul> 5.4 built in server does not
[13:25:19] <johnkpaul> I am trying to find out if 5.4 + apache also works fine
[13:25:32] <johnkpaul> it might be the 5.4 or it might be the built in server
[13:39:12] <johnkpaul> it's the built in server. damn
[14:05:55] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil, rwaldron: Do we have a rule about handling Number objects where numbers are expected?
[14:08:09] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: I'd say we generally don't worry too much about it. String objects can cause problems in places as well.
[14:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> So I can close this as wontfix? http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8280
[14:10:28] <timmywil> I would vote yes.
[16:40:51] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I like the idea of porting the jenkins-testswarm integration to grunt
[16:40:57] <jzaefferer> Or rather, writing it from scratch
[16:41:09] <jzaefferer> Will be a lot easier with the new TestSwarm API
[16:41:30] <jzaefferer> And will give us more options in specifying what files to run
[17:58:42] <scott_gonzalez> Quality bug report: #11668
[22:09:21] <clarkbox> does anyone know what the new URL is for testswarm rewrite krinkle is working on
[23:26:35] <gnarf> clarkbox: like a stage?
[23:26:42] <gnarf> no
[23:27:39] <clarkbox> ya. whats the plan. when is new stuff going live?
[23:27:43] <clarkbox> are we going to stage first?
[23:28:04] <gnarf> working on stages for everything now
[23:29:10] <gnarf> i think trac or our proxies are next for me
[23:29:23] <gnarf> i really don't wanna have to become a trac expert though
[23:29:30] <gnarf> not looking forward to that install at all
[23:29:40] <clarkbox> ok. ive been outta touch the last couple months. doing a bit of work on browserstack-testswarm right now
[23:29:49] <clarkbox> better you than me :)
[23:30:04] <gnarf> sadly, i think thats everyone's opinion
[23:30:11] <gnarf> :)
[23:32:15] <gnarf> clarkbox: just so you know, I've been tossing the idea of turning testswarm submission into a grunt process
[23:32:37] <clarkbox> ya makes sense to me
[23:33:12] <clarkbox> where does that leave jenkins?
[23:33:21] <gnarf> clarkbox: running grunt ;)
[23:33:29] <clarkbox> ahh
[23:33:40] <gnarf> clarkbox: it should be pretty "replacable" at that point
[23:33:54] <clarkbox> haha. nice.
[23:34:00] <gnarf> dunno what else we'd use
[23:34:29] <gnarf> clarkbox: it might be really neat to be able to do the job and spawn the workers from the same process
[23:34:46] <clarkbox> using bamboo right now at day job. i dont interact with it much, but seems to get the job done fairly reliably
[23:35:03] <gnarf> jenkins isn't too bad
[23:35:26] <gnarf> its just that we have issues with testswarm failures
[23:35:38] <gnarf> Krinkle was saying he put in a "token api" into the new swarm
[23:35:54] <clarkbox> ya i dont know much about this area. i dont do much testing. i just happen to be around when this testswarm-browserstack integ needed doing...
[23:35:57] <gnarf> so we could have the browserstack be the only client "allowed" and stop the crowdsource
[23:36:25] <clarkbox> ya sounds like krinkles rewrite will make things much more sane/reliable
