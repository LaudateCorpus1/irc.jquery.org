[07:19:32] <gibson042> .
[07:20:26] <DaveMethvin> hey gibson042, you've been a busy guy!
[07:21:02] <gibson042> yeah, I'm just about boolHooked out
[07:21:10] <DaveMethvin> i bet
[07:21:28] <gibson042> one more thing to do, though, related to the test failures I fixed
[07:24:19] <gibson042> we really should reorganize attrHooks to cover get/set/delete instead of just get/set, but *that's* a job for another day
[07:39:46] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery01] 15gibson042 pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/JpCyvQ
[07:39:46] <jqcommit> 13jquery/06master 1406f46da 15Richard Gibson: let .attr(checked|selected, true) update the property
[07:47:57] <gibson042> woohoo, the swarm's already done! http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1928
[07:48:25] <DaveMethvin> victory is yours!
[07:49:43] <gibson042> that's it for my 1.9 blockers, unless you think jquery-compat also needs https://github.com/jquery/jquery-compat/issues/2 first
[07:49:43] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2 on jquery-compat (gibson042; 11h, 26m ago): Restore 1.8 boolHook behavior
[07:49:56] <DaveMethvin> so gibson042 i should update the docs for the upgrade guide to remove the warning about checked and selected?
[07:50:13] <DaveMethvin> i mean, there's what is good practice and there's what breaks
[07:50:37] <gibson042> I think I'd leave them as-is
[07:50:46] <DaveMethvin> ok
[07:50:57] <gibson042> this last bit is just making IE<8 consistent with what other browsers *actually* do
[07:51:32] <DaveMethvin> i'm about to walk the dog but will finish off the docs this afternoon and i think we can get a release out by tonight
[07:51:40] <DaveMethvin> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[07:51:51] <gibson042> OH YEAH
[07:52:08] <DaveMethvin> thanks for all your work on this, it's awesome
[07:52:44] <gibson042> thanks for covering the loose ends
[07:53:07] <DaveMethvin> so is there anything that you think needs to go into the compat plugin still?
[07:53:18] <DaveMethvin> i agree the Deferred one doesn't seem that useful
[07:53:26] <DaveMethvin> really more like fixing a bug
[07:53:37] <gibson042> yep
[07:54:09] <gibson042> I think the compat plugin is good after it gets the boolHook update
[07:54:42] <DaveMethvin> so i've been testing the compat plugin locally using ?jquery=1.6.4 etc with various versions, there were a few cases where i couldn't easily make it all work with older versions but i still think it will be a useful tool for upgraders
[07:55:36] <gibson042> yeah, that's awesome
[07:55:44] <DaveMethvin> technically we should be testing jquery+jquery-compat with that jquery version's full test suite but, well, i'm too LAZY to do that
[07:55:58] <gibson042> :)
[07:56:10] <DaveMethvin> already too many permutations!
[07:56:25] <gibson042> heh
[07:56:30] <gibson042> what are we, jQuery UI? ;)
[07:56:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah!
[07:56:50] <DaveMethvin> there is ONE TRUE VERSION of core
[07:56:53] <gibson042> we can't be expected to support our old code!
[07:56:55] <DaveMethvin> well, um, two
[07:57:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah, the guys who wrote that crap were crazy
[07:57:23] <DaveMethvin> that's how i feel about all my code older than a month
[07:57:32] <gibson042> amen
[07:58:05] <DaveMethvin> so do you  have a handle on moving the boolHook over? Is it just cut and paste or do we need to be more subtle than that?
[07:58:29] <gibson042> cut and paste should be enough
[07:58:34] <gibson042> for the code and the tests, actually
[07:59:21] <DaveMethvin> ok, gotta run before the dog has an accident

[17:23:44] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1946
[17:24:26] <snover> quit breaking things
[17:24:39] <DaveMethvin> it wasn't me, honest!
[17:25:38] <DaveMethvin> i'm ready to do this beta release and the only thing stopping me is that the upgrade guide won't push to the live server
[17:26:43] <DaveMethvin> it should be at http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9 and i can see it at the stage server
[17:27:09] <DaveMethvin> no choice but to put out the ajpiano-shaped signal light
[17:28:20] <snover> the most embarrassing thing about that 404 page is how bad it looks
[18:10:45] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: whats going on , i just walked in
[18:10:50] <DaveMethvin> hey
[18:11:04] <DaveMethvin> looking for why my content won't push to production
[18:11:24] <DaveMethvin> so i edited stuff on jquery.com and it shows on stage
[18:11:35] <DaveMethvin> but not in production when i tag and push
[18:11:43] <ajpiano> did you t... darn
[18:11:48] <DaveMethvin> lol
[18:12:35] <DaveMethvin> i got the email that says it built and saw the new tag
[18:12:45] <ajpiano> oh man
[18:12:55] <ajpiano> so we are looking at the same things :/
[18:12:59] <ajpiano> i wonder if....
[18:13:00] <ajpiano> hm
[18:13:04] <snover> it’s because you are out of disk space!!!!1
[18:13:14] <ajpiano> YOURE OUT OF DISK SPACE
[18:13:15] <ajpiano> AND LINE
[18:13:20] <DaveMethvin> nonsense, i have plenty!
[18:13:59] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: i wonder if it's confused b/c that was the first page in the folder
[18:14:21] <snover> i ran out of line endings because unix kept putting them at the ends of my files
[18:14:48] <DaveMethvin> no that's probably not it, http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide should be there too
[18:15:03] <DaveMethvin> and it isnt
[18:15:37] <ajpiano> is 1.9.0b1 actually a valid semver
[18:15:48] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[18:16:31] <DaveMethvin> ut oh, see #10 http://semver.org/
[18:17:19] <ajpiano> yea you need some dash action
[18:17:27] <DaveMethvin> well we've always done our versions that way, and i already built them
[18:17:32] <DaveMethvin> but i can retag with a valid semver
[18:18:53] <DaveMethvin> oh i wonder if it will do that without some meaningless change and a new hash
[18:18:57] <DaveMethvin> i pushed the new tag
[18:19:48] <ajpiano> hrmmarm
[18:20:33] <ajpiano> haven't gotten a deploy e-mail :/
[18:20:37] <DaveMethvin> me neither
[18:20:45] <DaveMethvin> okay let me touch something and retag

[18:23:30] <snover> gogo
[18:23:32] <ajpiano> still no deploy email
[18:23:38] <ajpiano> and still 404 :(
[18:23:49] <DaveMethvin> RELOAD FASTER
[18:24:46] <DaveMethvin> i broked it
[18:26:22] <ajpiano> i still haven't seen a deploy e-mail
[18:26:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah, none for me either
[18:26:43] <DaveMethvin> that's not a good sign
[18:26:52] <DaveMethvin> at least it said it deployed before
[18:26:53] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: WOOO
[18:27:02] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[18:27:07] <ajpiano> i just deployed manually
[18:27:19] <ajpiano> oh god
[18:27:20] <DaveMethvin> it needs to have the other files deployed too
[18:27:26] <ajpiano> web-base-template?
[18:27:26] <DaveMethvin> there was  a change to web-base-template
[18:27:29] <DaveMethvin> lol
[18:27:39] <DaveMethvin> STOP READING MY MIND
[18:27:47] <ajpiano> did you do the tag there?
[18:27:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah when i made the change
[18:28:05] <DaveMethvin> or, maybe not
[18:28:12] <DaveMethvin> too many moving parts
[18:28:30] <ajpiano> there's only 2
[18:30:20] <snover> that’s so many
[18:30:52] <DaveMethvin> plus /jquery/jquery plus /jquery/jquery-compat plus several deploy scripts plus the tracker plus ....
[18:31:24] <DaveMethvin> THAT'S MORE LIKE IT
[18:31:39] <DaveMethvin> ok ajpiano thanks!
[18:31:50] <DaveMethvin> now i can put up the blog post
[18:32:56] <ajpiano> yay DaveMethvin !!
[18:32:58] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: can you sanity check this before i make it live? http://blog.jquery.com/?p=2310&preview=true&preview_id=2310&public=1&nonce=6d315ab016
[18:33:08] <DaveMethvin> and then i'll be ready for a tweeeeet
[18:33:52] <ajpiano> you don't want to wait till the morn to announce?
[18:34:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah i guess it's pretty late now
[18:35:12] <DaveMethvin> okay let me wait and i'll do it in the morning
[18:35:29] <ajpiano> ok
[18:35:37] <ajpiano> are we rolling with jQuery Compat plugin as like the plain english title
[18:35:49] <DaveMethvin> i guess, got a better name?
[18:35:50] <ajpiano> it's jarring to me
[18:36:00] <snover> jQuery Don’t Use This Plugin
[18:36:04] <snover> plugin
[18:36:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah...!
[18:36:14] <snover> just rolls off the tongue
[18:36:17] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: jQuery Compatibility at a bare min would prob be fine w/ me
[18:36:27] <ajpiano> just you know something that's like a word n stuff
[18:36:43] <DaveMethvin> like prepend then
[18:36:53] <ajpiano> ?wj
[18:36:53] <bot-t> well rejoindered
[18:36:55] <DaveMethvin> people can't spell that word!
[18:37:17] <ajpiano> oh oh DaveMethvin
[18:37:22] <ajpiano> eturns them as a map of properties.
[18:37:32] <ajpiano> should be object instead of map
[18:37:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah sloppy me
[18:37:59] <ajpiano> contributors–new and veteran–
[18:38:03] <ajpiano> should be
[18:38:14] <ajpiano> "contributors -- new and veteran -- worked"
[18:38:21] <ajpiano> or maybe "both old and new"
[18:38:28] <snover> just replace it with “ballers”
[18:38:48] <DaveMethvin> experienced and virgin
[18:38:56] <ajpiano> sweet, lots of summit folks in here
[18:38:59] <snover> shiny new ballers, well-weathered ballers
[18:39:16] <DaveMethvin> really hoping to draw them back in once they see their name in lights
[18:39:18] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: otherwise, post seems fine
[18:39:38] <snover> DaveMethvin: in that case, <marquee><blink><font size="72">contributor names</font></blink></marquee>
[18:39:41] <DaveMethvin> let me know if you can come up with some cornier things to say ajpiano
[18:39:53] <ajpiano>  DaveMethvin can't tell if people will brtistle at the xmas stuff but it seems harmless enough to me
[18:39:53] <DaveMethvin> that's where i can REALLY use YOUR expertise
[18:40:01] <ajpiano> also source tree is awesome
[18:40:21] <DaveMethvin> if i talk about kwanza at all people will think i'm ridiculing it
[18:40:26] <snover> it’s a festivus miracle
[18:40:54] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: do you think that "This plugin restores several of the deprecated and removed features so that existing code can run." should be extended to include "without having to modify it to conform to new APIs" or something:
[18:40:54] <ajpiano> ?
[18:41:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah i like that being more explicit
[18:41:20] <DaveMethvin> i like my blogs the same way i like my porn
[18:41:24] <ajpiano> haha
[18:41:27] <ajpiano> also, to snover's point
[18:41:34] <snover> can you get a dig in there, like, “will enable bad code to continue to work”
[18:41:42] <DaveMethvin> awww yeah
[18:41:42] <ajpiano> do you want to add a paragraph about how loike, we have the compat plugin, but it's meant to be a temporary thing
[18:41:57] <DaveMethvin> maybe we change the name to jQuery Crutch
[18:42:10] <DaveMethvin> jQuery Training Wheels, er Pants
[18:42:18] <ajpiano> you should use it to identify old things and fix them, not drop it in there and forget that you're using .live until 2037
[18:43:25] <snover> non-sarcastically (for once!!!), maybe you want to use the word migration
[18:43:30] <snover> instead of compatibility
[18:45:17] <ajpiano> that actually is a good idead, would require a repo name change tho
[18:45:36] <DaveMethvin> hmmmmmmmmm
[18:45:47] <DaveMethvin> dammit snover!
[18:45:56] <DaveMethvin> where were you before?
[18:45:57] <ajpiano> brb
[18:46:01] <snover> also which one of you removed me from the jquery members list on github, i am way more contributionering than cody
[18:46:16] <DaveMethvin> what list?
[18:46:16] * snover so offended
[18:46:26] <snover> https://github.com/jquery/
[18:46:28] <snover> i think it was gnarf
[18:46:40] <snover> when i was like “hey maybe you don’t want me on your private infrastructure repo”
[18:46:47] <DaveMethvin> oh
[18:46:50] <snover> and then he was like “OK GEEZ WHATEVER SNOVER”
[18:46:54] <snover> “DRAMA GUY”
[18:46:57] <snover> and removed me
[18:47:01] <snover> i am pretty sure that is exactly how it happened
[18:47:26] <gnarf> yup
[18:47:38] <snover> I have an eidetic memory for these kinds of insults
[18:47:43] <snover> i mean, idiotic memory
[18:48:05] <gnarf> what about the ones when you make fun of yourself?
[18:48:39] <snover> when isn’t that happening?
[18:52:27] <DaveMethvin> okay, if i renamed this repo from jquery-compat to jquery-migrate because snover made me, how hard would that be?
[18:52:33] <DaveMethvin> lessee
[18:52:47] <snover> i’ve got the gun and the kitten right here
[18:52:49] <DaveMethvin> how many watchers we got
[18:53:17] <snover> 5
[18:53:20] <DaveMethvin> not much action
[18:53:24] <DaveMethvin> so i think we'd be okay
[18:53:41] <snover> does this mean that you’ll have a 2.0 branch soon finally
[18:53:47] <snover> by which i mean
[18:53:49] <snover> a master branch
[18:53:52] <snover> that has 2.0 code
[18:53:53] <DaveMethvin> right
[18:53:54] <snover> :)
[18:53:55] <DaveMethvin> about another week
[18:54:07] <DaveMethvin> once the dust settles here
[18:54:15] <snover> ok, if i don’t murder the people that live upstairs from me by then, i am looking forward to it
[18:55:20] <DaveMethvin> okay, i really like jquery-migrade
[18:55:25] <DaveMethvin> migrate!
[18:55:32] <DaveMethvin> or maybe migrane
[18:56:01] <DaveMethvin> well at least now i have something to do tonight
[18:56:10] <DaveMethvin> totally hose everything
[18:56:20] <DaveMethvin> and it's all yer fault snover
[18:56:33] <snover> i am a work generator 
[18:56:40] <DaveMethvin> LALALALA NOT LISTENING
[18:56:57] <snover> busy generating work for myself by evaluating every test framework on the planet and finding them all deficient in one way or another
[18:58:22] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: what do you think about renaming jquery-compat to jquery-migrate?
[18:58:35] <DaveMethvin> since you're the only other forker i think you should know
[18:59:39] <gibson042> well I wouldn't know how to move my stuff over, but even if that's impossible (unlikely) I'd still be ok with it
[18:59:59] <DaveMethvin> do you have commits to land?
[19:00:04] <DaveMethvin> push up
[19:00:45] <DaveMethvin> i'll just rename the  heck out of everything, push, then rename the repo, and pull a fresh copy under the new name
[19:00:50] <DaveMethvin> at least that's the theory
[19:01:12] <DaveMethvin> and rename the references in the blog post and upgrade guide
[19:01:28] <gibson042> :yes: for me
[19:01:33] <DaveMethvin> what could possibly go wrong? :D
[19:01:59] <DaveMethvin> was that a yes for things to push up?
[19:02:00] <gibson042> and we can always blame it on snover
[19:02:07] <gibson042> no, you're clear to break it
[19:02:11] <DaveMethvin> it's a no-lose situation 
[19:02:22] <DaveMethvin> it either works or we blame it on snover
[19:02:44] <DaveMethvin> okay, starting my editor now ...
[19:06:59] <ajpiano> +1 for migrate
[19:07:09] <ajpiano> it's clearer and also a word that we can use in paragraphs
[19:07:10] <ajpiano> :D
[19:07:25] <ajpiano> also we have already had "compat" plugins in the past, now it's like an actual new thing
[19:07:25] <DaveMethvin> imma use premigrate
[19:07:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah, true
[19:55:22] <DaveMethvin> okay, i've migrated Compat to Migrate
[20:16:02] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery.com01] 15dmethvin pushed 2 new commits to 06master: 02http://git.io/wgBoiQ
[20:16:02] <jqcommit> 13jquery.com/06master 145658c7c 15Dave Methvin: See if this will go live with a tag.
[20:16:02] <jqcommit> 13jquery.com/06master 1405ed3cb 15Dave Methvin: Rename jQuery Compat to jQuery Migrate.
[20:22:26] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: why are we tracking bugs on migrate on bugs.jquery.com intead of in gh isues?
[20:22:47] <DaveMethvin> oh that was something i was gonna bring up in the meeting
[20:22:53] <DaveMethvin> i think we should do it on gh
[20:24:23] <snover> poor trac
[20:24:50] <DaveMethvin> mainly b/c i think it will confuse people more to have it be in trac
[20:28:33] <snover> i thought jquery.com was supposed to have a new design
[20:28:35] <snover> like 2 years ago
[20:29:00] <DaveMethvin> we couldn't find the rockstar graphic
[20:29:29] <DaveMethvin> redesign in the making, nobody wants it more than me .. except ajpiano
[20:30:00] <ajpiano> yea i was confused that it was in trac
[20:30:15] <DaveMethvin> we do sizzle bugs in gh
[20:30:20] <ajpiano> everytime i tell snover it's close
[20:30:22] <DaveMethvin> so we do have precedent
[20:30:28] <ajpiano> and jqm
[20:30:32] <ajpiano> etc
[20:30:42] <DaveMethvin> although i think they're pushing its limits for mobile
[20:30:43] <ajpiano> every time i tell him it's close then it doesn't happen
[20:30:58] <ajpiano> snover: we actually are using the OLD legacy design in our new wordpress now on purpose, it's heinous
[20:31:30] <snover> :)
[20:31:43] <snover> you’ll get it someday, don’t worry
[20:31:48] <ajpiano> yeah
[20:31:52] <ajpiano> Something Something™
[20:32:29] <DaveMethvin> alright guys i've done enough damage for tonight, i'd better stop before snover convinces me to rename the jquery repot to dojo3
[20:32:47] <snover> :)
[20:33:49] <ajpiano> :D
[20:33:54] <ajpiano> catch you tom DaveMethvin
[20:34:06] <DaveMethvin> when willya be around ajpiano
