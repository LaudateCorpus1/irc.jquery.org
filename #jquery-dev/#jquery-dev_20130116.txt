[05:28:33] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin|away: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13223 Not that I want to retreat or anything, but surely whitespace at the beginning of an otherwise perfectly fine piece of HTML should be treated as HTML, right? dmethvin, perhaps we went a bit too far on "looks like HTML" strictness? I know we can have this debate for years, and the answer is "use $.parseHTML()", but just a fleeting thought.
[05:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: I think the big argument for why we don't allow leading spaces is because it forces them to do the right thing and use $.parseHTML.
[05:35:28] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: can you repeat what you wrote
[05:35:30] <mikesherov> I missed it
[05:35:38] <scott_gonzalez> I think the big argument for why we don't allow leading spaces is because it forces them to do the right thing and use $.parseHTML.
[05:36:02] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: sure
[05:36:13] <scott_gonzalez> You should really only end up with leading spaces for constructed HTML, as opposed to static strings.
[05:36:28] <mikesherov> well, for example, what about this
[05:36:40] <mikesherov> $('
[05:36:41] <scott_gonzalez> Of course the $( "\{new-line}<div>..." ) example came up.
[05:36:48] <mikesherov> right
[05:37:00] <mikesherov> and I think some people do that as a "best practice"
[05:37:14] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[05:37:24] <mikesherov> air quotes
[05:37:46] <mikesherov> My only thought is that leading whitespace is not meaningful for selectors
[05:38:19] <mikesherov> it's not ambiguous like other situations
[05:38:27] <mikesherov> so, just a fleeting thought
[05:38:31] <mikesherov> I'm fine if we keep it as is
[05:41:06] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have strong feelings either way.
[05:42:00] <scott_gonzalez> I seem to remember the last time we had this discussion, it ended with someone saying that timmywil would be able to say "I told you so" at some point.
[05:42:11] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't remember whether he wanted to accept the leading whitespace or not.

[09:48:57] <ajpiano> oh man i just saw that jaubourg
[09:48:58] <ajpiano> legendary
[09:49:10] <jaubourg> isnt it? :)
[09:50:32] <DaveMethvin> I ASKED FOR THE LATEST VERSION AND DAMMIT YOU GAVE ME THE LATEST VERSION
[09:50:51] <jaubourg> HOW DARE U?!?
[09:51:03] <DaveMethvin> I MEANT THE LATEST VERSION THAT WORKS WITH MY COPY/PASTAED PLUGINS OF COURSE
[09:51:08] <ajpiano> https://twitter.com/brianblakely/status/291585097289842688
[09:51:08] <b-ot> ajpiano, @brianblakely: Who was the genius who decided to remove a major feature from @jquery before version 2?  Do they not understand semantic versioning?
[09:51:21] <ajpiano> trololol
[09:51:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:51:44] <jaubourg> those jquery guys are so dumb!
[09:51:52] <DaveMethvin> I think that's a valid question but we're kind of stuck between a rock and a hard place
[09:52:07] <DaveMethvin> i suppose we could have dropped stuff and made that 2, then dropped oldIE and made that 3
[09:52:17] <jaubourg> it's not, we just removed deprecated stuff
[09:52:26] <jaubourg> stuff that was not supported any longer
[09:52:33] <DaveMethvin> deprecated, schmeprecated! :D
[09:52:37] <jaubourg> we could have dropped this stuff in 1.8.4
[09:52:43] <jaubourg> :P
[09:52:57] <DaveMethvin> well usually you wait for a major-point
[09:53:25] <DaveMethvin> but again the main reason these guys are complaining is that they are asking for latest without any testing on their part
[09:53:28] <DaveMethvin> and i think that's a bad idea
[09:53:43] <jaubourg> remove "and I think" from your last sentence
[09:54:00] <DaveMethvin> we just went through the "gimme the latest" with our node dependencies so we KNOW how bad an idea this is
[09:54:11] <jaubourg> heh
[09:54:44] <DaveMethvin> if you've never tested the combo of a new jquery and your plugins you shouldn't be using it on your site
[09:54:55] <DaveMethvin> semantic versioning or not
[09:56:14] <snover> fuckers
[09:56:47] <DaveMethvin> yeah why didn't we do like dojo
[09:57:08] <DaveMethvin> i can have 1.5 code and use 1.8, it works perfectly i bet!

[10:00:49] <gibson0421> DaveMethvin are you intentionally referencing the guide on stage.jquery.com instead of jquery.com?

[10:02:31] <gibson0421> but jaubourg may in fact be right
[10:02:32] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: most likely
