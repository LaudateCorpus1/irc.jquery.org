[13:15:47] <Krinkle> RoanKattouw and I are investigating some performance issues in Wikimedia's VisualEditor library and we're encountering quite a lot of overhead from Sizzle.setDocument due differnet code paths interacting with different documents.
[13:16:23] <Krinkle> Things like $foo.children( selector ) and $( selector ), where $foo is from a detached data model document, causes it to switch a lot, and thus redo all the support tests 
[13:16:43] <Krinkle> Up to ~ 100 times on a simple page.
[13:17:39] <RoanKattouw> My favorite one is where $foo.children() takes different code paths depending on whether $foo[0].childNodes.length is 1 or >1
[13:17:59] <RoanKattouw> If it's 1, it calls setDocument( $foo[0].ownerDocument ) , if it's >1 it calls setDocument( window.document )
[13:18:34] <RoanKattouw> So even if the client code isn't doing things that causes Sizzle to context-switch between documents all the time, things like that will still cause context switches
[13:20:46] <Krinkle> Yeah, I'm curious why matches() passes null->global document to setDocument from Sizzle, and matchesSelector() the owner document. I guess if seed contains multiple nodes it can't know for sure which the owner document is, but when coming from children(), it's a bit odd to have it switch back and forth. Which means even if you only interact with one document at a time, it still switches to global a lot. P
[13:20:46] <Krinkle> ractically impossible to deal with in a feasible way it seems..
[14:17:23] <gibson042> Krinkle & RoanKattouw: that .matches resets the context document is a bug that was just never visible until now... the fix is straightforward and should come soon
[14:18:20] <gibson042> but "if seed contains multiple nodes it can't know for sure which the owner document is" is indeed why the code is in its current state
[14:28:40] <Krinkle> gibson042: Those two things are the same thing. matches() is only used if more than one node is involved.
[14:28:49] <Krinkle> otherwise it uses matchesSelector
[14:58:28] <nerb_> i'm pretty new to coding, and i'm having a tough time understanding whether i don't understand the replaceWith() function or if Chrome dev tools are just slightly misleading.
[14:58:32] <nerb_> i've got a span with class 'current-selection' which is just coloring a portion of a <p i'm trying to remove the span and place the original text in the <p>
[14:58:37] <nerb_> the line i'm using is $(".current-selection").replaceWith($(".current-selection").text());
[14:58:45] <nerb_> from the way i understand it, i'm actually getting rid of the span from the DOM but the elements displayed in the chrome dev tools don't change and i can't tell if i'm actually affecting the DOM at all
[14:59:01] <nerb_> any help would be much appreciated!
[15:05:27] <RoanKattouw> nerb_: When I'm trying to unwrap something like that, I usually use $foo.replaceWith($foo.contents())   (same as your code but .contents() as opposed to .text())
[15:05:39] <RoanKattouw> I know .contents() works, I don't know if .text() works, so that may or may not be your problem
[15:06:15] <RoanKattouw> Also, the Chrome console will show you the return value of .replaceWith(), which might be something misleading like the element that was removed or something
