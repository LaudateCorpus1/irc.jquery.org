[06:05:58] <kborchers> can someone verify that the contentType option on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ should have Type: String or Boolean based on https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/ajax.js#L589 or is that something we aren't documenting?
[06:09:12] <DaveMethvin> kborchers news to me, I wonder if it was added in response to a ticket
[06:09:47] <kborchers> DaveMethvin: yeah, i just noticed it too doing some multipart upload stuff
[06:11:06] <DaveMethvin> well it seems like too good a feature to be accidental
[06:11:11] <DaveMethvin> so it shoudl be documented
[06:11:24] <kborchers> ok, i'll send a PR

[08:10:23] <DaveMethvin> okay, now i grow some balls and land this cross-frame focus nightmare
[08:25:31] <DaveMethvin> okay so much for that ... failing in 1.x so not this beta
[08:26:03] <snover> or ever
[08:26:32] <DaveMethvin> well the two branches are different in their data handling and it's leaking data
[08:26:45] <DaveMethvin> just no time to track it down, i have a meeting at noon
[08:27:11] <DaveMethvin> and i really dislike cross-frame crap anyway
[08:30:34] <gibson042> line-height tests are looking good :)
[08:30:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah they're holding up
[08:36:29] <DaveMethvin> dammit chrome, stop being so cachey
[08:58:47] <m_gol> incognito mode to the rescue ;)
[09:18:35] <tbranyen> DaveMethvin: when is 2.1 expected to land and would any amount of $$$ help that date along?
[09:19:02] <DaveMethvin> 1 million dollars
[09:19:29] <tbranyen> so pumped about this AMDification
[09:19:45] <tbranyen> DaveMethvin: would you guys consider migration to ES6 modules and transpiling to AMD/CJS
[09:20:08] <tbranyen> Kind of a nice win there
[09:20:25] <m_gol> the drawback is compilation is required then
[09:20:33] <m_gol> and AMD can be used in current browsers as-is
[09:21:09] <DaveMethvin> we can use es6 modules when they are real
[09:38:15] <m_gol> :)
[09:38:23] <m_gol> true that, the spec is still in flux
[09:55:20] <tbranyen> DaveMethvin|away: ha fair enough
[09:55:28] <tbranyen> not like you have to say, yes we are converting today
[09:55:46] <tbranyen> it'll be nice once they are "real" because we already have build tools for it
[09:55:52] <tbranyen> will be ready to go from day 1
[09:57:28] <m_gol> but not client-side ready and that's important for us

[13:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I am :-)
[13:46:43] <DaveMethvin> so just wanted to double check how to put something in the cdn
[13:46:57] <DaveMethvin> clone the repo, commit the new files, tag and push?
[13:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> Don't need to tag, it deploys on every commit.
[13:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> But other than that, yes.
[13:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> The indexes are auto-generated.
[13:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> So you just need to add the files.
[13:47:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah it looked simple ... TOO simple
[13:48:08] <DaveMethvin> other than having to clone the entire cdn to my disk
[13:48:10] <DaveMethvin> but now i have it
[13:49:11] <DaveMethvin> aw crap autocrlf
[13:49:26] <DaveMethvin> now i have to refigure this for the 38th times
[13:49:44] <DaveMethvin> warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in cdn/jquery-1.11.0-beta1.js.
[13:49:44] <DaveMethvin> The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
[14:13:05] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: what is this... http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core/948/console
[14:13:09] <m_gol> all passed and the test failed
[14:13:20] <m_gol> did a browser capture failed or what?
[14:13:44] <DaveMethvin> it timed out i think
[14:14:19] <m_gol> I guess this is sth that shouldn't happen so often if we had a Selenium-based backend?
[14:15:04] <m_gol> umm, Dave, you tagged it wrong :P
[14:15:19] <m_gol> should be 2.1.0-beta.1, not 2.1.0-beta1
[14:15:19] <m_gol> ;)
[14:15:40] <DaveMethvin> either worksforme
[14:16:03] <m_gol> at least that's more semver-like ;)
[14:16:25] <m_gol> I guess that's because beta2 > beta10
[14:16:32] <m_gol> and beta.2 < beta.10
[14:16:53] <m_gol> not that it matters very very much, but it'd be better to be consistent ;)
[14:41:48] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I believe there were more tickets closed, weren't there? http://blog.jquery.com/?p=3068&preview=true&preview_id=3068&public=1&nonce=7efff6a5ad
[14:42:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah there were, i need to update the post
[14:42:10] <DaveMethvin> still need to push to the cdn
[14:42:26] <DaveMethvin> i'll get it within the hour
[14:43:09] <m_gol> k, great :)
[15:27:18] <DaveMethvin> m_gol do you know of some missing tickets? I made the post live b/c i have to run but I can update if I missed some
[15:28:13] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I can look into it
[15:28:19] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[15:28:51] <m_gol> did you parse git logs to produce the list?
[15:29:18] <DaveMethvin> i used trac reports
[15:29:35] <DaveMethvin> there's a script in build/release-notes.js
[15:29:45] <m_gol> ok, so I
[15:30:07] <m_gol> * so I guess what remains for me is to look at the list and think if I remember about anything else
[15:30:13] <m_gol> since automatic checks are done :)
[15:30:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah it could be that there were some tix closed with wrong milestones or something, i did a quick search and didn't see any
[15:30:50] <DaveMethvin> i updated all the 1.10.3/2.0.4 ones 
[15:31:08] <m_gol> ok, so I'll maybe try to parse git logs
[15:31:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would be a good double check ... it's easy to miss some if they're setup wrong in trac
[15:31:58] <m_gol> k, will do
[15:37:35] <snover> thanks DaveMethvin

[17:18:59] <DaveMethvin> m_gol thanks! I updated the post
[17:19:04] <m_gol> thx :)
[17:23:44] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: we fail 2 tests on iOS7
[17:23:47] <m_gol> very weird tests
[17:23:56] <m_gol> e.g. doc ready is not fired after DOMContentLoaded
[17:24:17] <DaveMethvin> well it looks like I need to buy a new iPad then
[17:24:18] <DaveMethvin> :)
[17:24:23] <m_gol> ;)
[17:24:38] <DaveMethvin> all i have is an iPad1, good for safari 5.1 tests tho
[17:24:49] <m_gol> I wonder what could possibly make this test fail, it's kind of an important one :)
[17:25:03] <m_gol> I have iPhone 4 & iPad 4
[17:25:08] <m_gol> and a Mac with an emulator ;)
[17:25:10] <m_gol> good for tests
[17:25:22] <DaveMethvin> emulator? not good enough! i deserve the best!
[17:25:41] <m_gol> contrary to what's in the Android world, iOS simulator is actually faster than a proper iOS device
[17:25:41] <DaveMethvin> i have a feeling this version of safari will get a bunch of fixes soon
[17:25:48] <DaveMethvin> they really screwed up a bunch of stuff
[17:25:51] <m_gol> since it doesn't emulate anything, it runs natively :)
[17:25:54] <m_gol> haha, yeah
[17:26:00] <m_gol> no alerts in WebView, wtf.
[17:26:42] <m_gol> if they don't fire window load properly... that would be a big one
[17:28:08] <m_gol> and the onbeforeunload test fails
[17:28:20] <DaveMethvin> http://www.mobilexweb.com/blog/safari-ios7-html5-problems-apis-review
[17:28:29] <m_gol> I have a feeling it's not our fault ;)
[17:28:34] <m_gol> yeah, I've seen this one
[17:28:34] <snover> oh, is everything broken? great
[17:28:48] <snover> “REMOVED support for input type=datetime” fuckin thanks guys
[17:29:05] <DaveMethvin> i got no time for dates
[17:29:22] <snover> because native date picker is such a great thing to need to emulate
[17:29:29] <m_gol> well, that's actually not a big deal, I believe it's deprecated
[17:29:38] <m_gol> you have type="date" & type="time" separate
[17:30:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah it was kicked out by the w3c
[17:30:05] <snover> since when?
[17:30:26] <DaveMethvin> imo those widgets are too complex to be built into the browser, much better as Web Components
[17:30:55] <snover> datetime is still in the html5 spec
[17:30:57] <m_gol> the real screw-up is removind type="week" without making it fallback to type="text" :)
[17:31:02] <snover> y’alls on crack
[17:31:16] <DaveMethvin> WAT?
[17:31:16] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: Hey, there's the word java in javascript, so that should guarantee the performance, right?
[17:31:18] <gibson042> I want my type="meat-doneness"!
[17:31:20] <snover> http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/the-input-element.html#attr-input-type
[17:31:22] <snover> spec!
[17:31:37] <snover> <input> is the dumbest html element
[17:31:42] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 it should be a spinner shaped like a rotisserie
[17:31:59] <gibson042> :D
[17:32:08] <snover> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/Input just look at this thing
[17:32:16] <snover> let’s overload it some more please
[17:32:25] <DaveMethvin> too many things are inputty
[17:32:43] <DaveMethvin> they should deprecate select and make input type=select
[17:33:10] <DaveMethvin> which would be cool since there's a select event on inputs and that would confuse the crap out of everything
[17:33:35] <gibson042> and textarea, that one's even worse
[17:33:58] <DaveMethvin> input type="image-editor"
[17:34:00] <gibson042> <textarea>value goes here because suck it</textarea>
[17:34:27] <DaveMethvin> did you know you could appendChild(text node) on a textarea?
[17:34:40] <DaveMethvin> who dealt this mess?
[17:34:51] <m_gol> input type="address-bar"
[17:35:01] <DaveMethvin> lol now that is an idea
[17:35:06] <DaveMethvin> not a good idea, but still
[17:35:18] <gibson042> input type="input-type"
[17:35:18] <m_gol> I'm sure iOS8 would remove support :P
[17:35:31] <DaveMethvin> input-ception
[17:37:04] <DaveMethvin> snover i can't find the official info on datetime deprecation 
[17:37:22] <snover> well it was always a pretty dumb control, datetime-local is always the one you wanted
[17:37:23] <gibson042> hell, let's get Singularity-ready and declare input type="sensorium-stream"
[17:37:25] <m_gol> I'd be happy to try to find these bugs in a pre-release but I'm not paying $99 a year to do tests for Apple
[17:38:16] <m_gol> actually, we fail the onbeforeunload test even on iOS6 so it seems our fault after all
[17:38:18] <DaveMethvin> Web Components can only create new element names afaik, so at least they won't try to overload more input names
[17:38:37] <m_gol> but the no-doc-ready-after-DOMContentLoaded bug is iOS7-exclusive ;)
[17:41:26] <snover> webkitcurrentplaybacktargetiswirelesschanged
[17:41:28] <snover> are you kidding me
[17:41:43] <snover> why are there so many bad developers
[17:41:46] <snover> why are they allowed to make APIs
[17:41:52] <snover> god help us
[17:42:07] <m_gol> well, the JS convention of event names is screwed up
[17:42:19] <DaveMethvin> don't worry snover, that's a vendor-specific event
[17:42:36] <snover> oh ok, nobody ever uses those so i guess it is ok
[17:42:49] <DaveMethvin> the standard will go with currentplaybacktargetiswirelesschanged
[17:42:51] <m_gol> webkitdidijustintroduceanawesomeamountofnewbugs
[17:42:55] <m_gol> hahahaha
[17:43:36] <m_gol> neither Sauce Labs nor BrowserStack have iOS7 yet
[17:43:51] <DaveMethvin> that's just supercalifragilisticexpialadocious
[17:43:59] <m_gol> where are we on automating iOS tests?
[17:44:12] <m_gol> are we waiting for a switch to Sauce Labs before adding them?
[17:44:29] <snover> ooh. switch to intern while you are at it :D
[17:44:32] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure
[17:45:48] <m_gol> snover: yeah, let's rewrite all 6667 tests :P
[17:46:00] <snover> hey they were all pretty bad the last time i checked
[17:46:13] <snover> which admittedly was like 2 years ago
[17:46:22] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: who is on switching us there? :)
[17:46:42] <DaveMethvin> are you volunteering? PLEASE!
[17:46:43] <snover> anyway you would not really be rewriting the tests
[17:46:55] <snover> you would probably just write a qunit interface and wrap them in amd modules
[17:47:02] <snover> i wish i was not doing 100 different things or i would do it for you
[17:47:24] <DaveMethvin> just like snover, can't handle 101 things
[17:47:25] <DaveMethvin> :)
[17:47:31] <snover> i know :(
[17:47:34] <DaveMethvin> btw snover thanks for getting the AMD stuff started
[17:47:55] <snover> anything i can do to diminish dojo’s technical superiority versus other things DaveMethvin :)
[17:47:58] <m_gol> yeah, I like how the codebase looks after the switch :)
[17:48:26] <DaveMethvin> snover isn't that IBM's job?
[17:48:34] <snover> and a good job they do!
[17:48:59] <snover> someone put out some framework complexity comparison and thanks to their inability to ship good code it makes dojo look a lot worse than it actually is
[17:49:06] <snover> since it is based on todomvc
[17:50:02] <snover> i want to win the lottery, not because i am lazy, but because software development is terminally depressing and i want to go find a hole and crawl into it
[17:50:09] <snover> forever
[17:50:11] <snover> ))<>((
[17:50:41] <DaveMethvin> you set your standards too high snover
[17:50:57] <snover> i know
[17:51:47] <snover> today during a meeting someone said “can we have someone that is less thorough than snover review this instead to save time”
[17:52:08] <DaveMethvin> lol they have a point
[17:53:24] <snover> the day i review some code and go “wow this is the most amazing code and i have no nitpicks at all” is the day i retire
[17:54:37] <snover> so never ask me to review your code, DaveMethvin
[17:54:44] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, right!
[17:54:47] <snover> i’m going to have a mortgage to pay soon
[17:55:02] <DaveMethvin> what can you buy up there, an igloo?
