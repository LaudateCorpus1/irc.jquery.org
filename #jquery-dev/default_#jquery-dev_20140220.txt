[07:19:53] <timmywil> gibson042: when are you going to land your shit
[07:20:39] <timmywil> I want moar speed
[07:21:27] <DaveMethvin> THIS is why they shouldn't give people in Chattanooga a fast internet connection
[07:22:28] <DaveMethvin> i'd settle for getting my puny 500M box via vagrant without a checksum error
[08:20:38] <scott_gonzalez> mkwst: ping
[11:15:54] <scott_gonzalez> This is fun: http://jsbin.com/juvoceba/3/edit
[11:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> At least it's always <.5px difference
[11:28:30] <gnarf> hah
[11:28:57] <gnarf> the pattern continues actually too
[11:29:41] <DaveMethvin> what tha .... ?
[11:29:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: replace em with px same thing
[11:29:59] <gnarf> if you have a fractional pixel
[11:30:03] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[11:30:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: set font-size to 10px and use em and no bug
[11:30:25] <gnarf> :)
[11:30:35] <gnarf> cuz .1em = 1pc
[11:30:36] <gnarf> px
[11:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> I discovered this while JÃ¶rn and I were debugging dialog test failures that started in Chrome 32.
[11:31:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm assuming this is because 0.1 + 299.8 + 0.1 == 300.00000000000006
[11:32:05] <scott_gonzalez> But why does it get up to .4 off?
[11:32:42] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's the really strange part
[11:33:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: check the pattern: http://jsbin.com/juvoceba/5/
[11:33:46] <gnarf> for each 0.01 it seems to go off by 0.02 until the half pixel marker
[11:34:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's off by the amount of padding until it hits .25.
[11:34:12] <gnarf> also, .25px padding results in 0.25px: 300.5 which rounds to 301
[11:36:51] <gnarf> there are some interesting differences in the get bounding client rect: http://jsbin.com/juvoceba/7/edit
[11:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's adjusting by the amount of padding (if you use paddingTop instead of padding, it won't double).
[11:38:26] <gnarf> seems subpixels are rounded to the nearest 1/Math.pow(2,5) 
[11:39:00] <DaveMethvin> obviously! :P
[11:41:23] <gnarf> but yeah, it seems to remove the "subpixel" from the "height"
[11:43:52] <gnarf> seems at a .5px padding weirdness happens
[16:59:30] <Krinkle> I want to build an index of jQuery API documentation that is compatible with jsduck. Example of it's syntax: https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck/tree/master/js-classes (contains jsduck-style docs for ES5)
[16:59:44] <Krinkle> thinking I should be able to build that based on api.jquery.com source files from git
[17:00:33] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: seems like it, you could just write some code to read the xml and transform it
[18:20:09] <arschmitz> apparently google is scrapping the api docs now https://www.dropbox.com/s/tb985nkl57zfl3b/Screenshot%202014-02-20%2021.18.30.png
[18:21:12] <DaveMethvin> I would think "jquery parent" should return a picture of jeresig
[18:21:43] <arschmitz> ha ha

[19:36:55] <arschmitz> awesome ha ha ha 
[19:56:22] <Krinkle> Still a work in progress, but initial commit: https://github.com/Krinkle/jsduck-jquery
[19:56:32] <Krinkle> http://krinkle.github.io/jsduck-jquery/dist/jsduck-jquery.js
[19:56:33] <Krinkle> http://krinkle.github.io/jsduck-jquery/doc/
[19:56:41] <Krinkle> the generated version doesen't really matter (no-one would use that)
[19:57:05] <Krinkle> but for people that use jsduck to document their app, to include and resolve type hints etc.
