[13:42:17] <timmywil> releases tested
[13:44:16] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: you there?
[13:44:22] <timmywil> ya
[13:44:39] <DaveMethvin> so i think we should expose at least that one for 1.12/2.2
[13:44:46] <DaveMethvin> we know they're using it
[13:44:52] <timmywil> which? domManip?
[13:45:04] <DaveMethvin> let me look
[13:45:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah domManip
[13:45:31] <timmywil> ok
[13:45:34] <DaveMethvin> they're using it and it's gonna break their code
[13:45:43] <timmywil> they?
[13:45:59] <DaveMethvin> justinbmeyer
[13:46:06] <DaveMethvin> he's in that thread
[13:46:10] <timmywil> ah, canjs
[13:46:16] <timmywil> ok then
[13:46:33] <timmywil> should have read the full ticket
[13:46:49] <DaveMethvin> we should keep it unexposed in 3.0, that's the time to remove those
[13:46:51] <timmywil> I only read your comment.
[13:47:04] <DaveMethvin> the others make me nervous removing in a minor but nobody mentioned them
[13:47:29] <timmywil> technically, domManip is internal too, but we'll make an exception for canjs
[13:47:49] <DaveMethvin> they were internal but exposed, that's the problem
[13:48:04] <DaveMethvin> on a 3.0 i think we can make the strong case for taking them out
[13:48:10] <timmywil> right, but subject to change
[13:48:20] <DaveMethvin> which is what was going to happen until we came up with 1.12/2.2
[13:48:29] <timmywil> didn't we de-expose some stuff in 1.11 too?
[13:48:57] <DaveMethvin> maybe? i can't recall
[13:49:06] <DaveMethvin> obvs in 1.9/2.0 we did
[13:49:16] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we'd do that today since we've gone semver
[13:50:04] <timmywil> well, I don't agree with the semver argument. Use undocumented methods at your own risk. But I will agree with a pragmatic argument if people are using something.
[13:51:36] <DaveMethvin> we are hiding a lot of stuff: .dir, .sibling, .domManip, .buildFragment, .access, .swap some of those have been around for nearly the whole time
[13:52:18] <DaveMethvin> i wish we had some way to tell if they were being used!
[13:52:43] <timmywil> yea
[13:53:17] <DaveMethvin> i suppose we can just unhide domManip for now and re-expose any critical ones in a .1 release if needed
[13:53:30] <timmywil> I like that idea
[13:53:39] <DaveMethvin> but they should all come out in 3.0 anyway
[13:53:51] <timmywil> agreed
[13:54:36] <timmywil> Honestly, if we're down to whether or not to expose would-be private methods, I'd rather get this out the door and address it in a point release if needed.
[13:55:04] <DaveMethvin> except for domManip which we already know is needed, i agree
[13:55:13] <timmywil> ya, except for that
[13:55:50] <DaveMethvin> i went back and reset the versions of the tickets to 1.12/2.2 so the changelog shoudl be right, but you may want to check again
[13:56:06] <DaveMethvin> there's a LOT of stuff in this release!
[13:56:13] <DaveMethvin> some of it is pretty old
[13:56:31] <timmywil> thanks, will do
[13:56:49] <DaveMethvin> i have to run, be back a bit later
[13:57:23] <timmywil> ok, thanks

[15:29:42] <markelog> timmywil: you just released 2.2/1.12?
[15:29:52] <timmywil> I did!
[15:30:00] <timmywil> working on blog post names
[15:30:24] <markelog> cool, did you label 2.2/1.12 issues?
[15:30:30] <timmywil> dave did
[15:31:14] <markelog> awesome!
[15:31:21] <markelog> let me know if i can help
[15:31:30] <timmywil> thanks
[15:32:03] <markelog> didn't realize we wanted to do it today
[15:32:21] <timmywil> looked ready
[15:32:42] <markelog> yeah, it seems we checked everything :-)
[16:26:42] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: did you need help on anything? didn't realize you were pulling the trigger
[16:26:58] <timmywil> nope, just working out changelogs now
[16:27:02] <DaveMethvin> k
[16:27:31] <timmywil> I've got the contributor list with github links.
[16:27:39] <timmywil> all that's left is a good changelog.
[16:27:49] <DaveMethvin> THE HARD PART :)
[16:27:55] <timmywil> yea, it's a pain
[16:28:05] <timmywil> Fortunately, I wrote a script last time
[16:28:17] <timmywil> but now I want to remove all these reverted commits
[16:28:23] <timmywil> there's a lot this time
[16:28:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[16:28:32] <DaveMethvin> normally we hardly revert anything
[16:28:42] <DaveMethvin> i think the blog already  highlights some good stuff
[16:28:46] <DaveMethvin> brb
[17:16:11] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: if you get a chance, could we tweet the release? Or we could tweet in the morning or on Monday.

[18:20:12] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil are you around this weekend? may be quite a bit of traffic in the tracker
[18:20:25] <timmywil> yea, I'll try to keep an eye out
[18:41:18] <snover> timmywil: well he phrases like an innocent question but actually i am pretty sure he will break your arms if you don’t comply :)
[18:41:30] <snover> oh good lord

[18:41:36] <snover> timmywil: well he phrases like an innocent question but actually i am pretty sure he will break your arms if you don’t comply :)
[18:42:34] <timmywil> we all know how vicious Dave is
[18:46:35] <snover> it’s where he got his nickname “nice guy dave”
[18:46:46] <snover> those aren’t quotes around the nickname, they are actually part of it
