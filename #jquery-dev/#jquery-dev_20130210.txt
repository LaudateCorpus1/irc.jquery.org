[16:54:05] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 your commit for jquery-migrate for attrFn got me thinking, i wonder if we should preserve any older $.browser
[17:18:14] <snover> DaveMethvin: that is a terrible thing to wonder
[17:37:26] <gibson042> DaveMethvin it *would* be true to the spirit of jquery-migrate
[17:37:36] <gibson042> old code works the same, but with warnings as appropriate
[17:38:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah i don't know how common it would be, but it looks easy to do
[17:54:54] <DaveMethvin> the github issue tracker interface is SO unintutitive that it was faster for me to figure out what i wanted and craft a URL
