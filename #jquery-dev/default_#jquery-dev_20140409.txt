[05:20:41] <rxaviers> all: hello guys! Does anyone (AMD-expert) have a clue of what could be possibly going on here? https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/10194312
[05:21:20] <rxaviers> I've already asked a couple of folks, but still couldnt figure out
[09:43:48] <markelog> scott_gonzalez: ping
[09:44:45] <markelog> jzaefferer: ping
[09:44:49] <scott_gonzalez> pong
[09:47:37] <markelog> DaveMethvin: it looks like we're ready to merge https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/236
[09:47:39] <markelog> are we?
[09:51:12] <jzaefferer> I see Karma's lack of support of loading the html file directly as a blocker, so no
[09:52:44] <markelog> aren't we discuss this?
[09:53:01] <markelog> sizzle does not have testing infra
[09:53:03] <markelog> right know
[09:53:17] <markelog> it better to have something to begin with
[09:53:22] <markelog> then nothing at all
[09:54:00] <markelog> i distinctly remember you saying that we do sizzle, then try to work our way up
[09:54:51] <jzaefferer> I'm still okay with starting at Sizzle, but not with a half-backed solution that introduces a lot of new complexity itself
[09:55:20] <jzaefferer> If its just a matter of getting test coverage for each push, we could as well put Sizzle on the existing infrastructure that we already have
[09:56:21] <jzaefferer> I still haven't heard anything about how you'd replace the PHP scripts in jQuery Core's testsuite - that's a problem for Karma, and most other tools that bring their own HTTP server (like browserstack-runner)
[09:56:51] <markelog> that's not a problem, start nodejs server, proxy karma to it
[09:56:53] <jzaefferer> I'd like to see at least a prototype for that, e.g. convert a single PHP file and the tests that use it to something else
[09:57:16] <markelog> what prototype?
[09:57:19] <markelog> it's feature of karma
[09:57:28] <jzaefferer> a prototype for "start nodejs server, proxy karma to it"
[09:58:11] <markelog> start task, which starts server, then start karma task, point to it's proxy to our server
[09:58:47] <markelog> in fact we even can leave php tests
[09:58:49] <markelog> if you like them
[09:58:51] <markelog> )
[09:59:01] <markelog> and point karma proxy there
[09:59:17] <jzaefferer> if its that easy, write some code
[10:03:07] <markelog> jzaefferer: i actually ment to ask about my comment there https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/350#issuecomment-39978719
[10:05:46] <markelog> good or not?
[10:06:07] <jzaefferer> almost, commented there
[10:34:24] <markelog> jzaefferer: can you comment there again please? :-)
