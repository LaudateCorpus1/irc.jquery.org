[05:08:37] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: that opera 11.11 bug, I couldn't figure it out
[05:08:48] <mikesherov> Not sure why those specific tests failed
[05:09:08] <DaveMethvin> could have been cosmic rays mikesherov, i get a lot of that from testswarm
[05:09:16] <mikesherov> but according to my own analytics, only .79% of Opera Users are on 11.11
[05:09:32] <DaveMethvin> wow, we were SO lucky to find a copy to run then
[05:09:32] <mikesherov> which is like .001% of users
[05:09:55] <mikesherov> LUCKY
[05:10:07] <mikesherov> anyway, so my appendchecked PR is ready to go
[05:10:19] <mikesherov> I'm still rebasing the vendor prefix one
[05:10:33] <DaveMethvin> i really want to get 1.8 infrastructure straightened out this month ... build process, testing, that kind of stuff
[05:10:46] <mikesherov> yeah, agreed
[05:10:54] <mikesherov> especially with grunt and CCAO
[05:11:08] <mikesherov> in other news, looks like Chrome 18 fixed the checked cloning stuff
[05:11:31] <DaveMethvin> so we don't need to land that?
[05:11:57] <mikesherov> no, we need to land that
[05:12:13] <DaveMethvin> yay
[05:12:22] <mikesherov> either that or remove the chrome unit tests altogether because they currently target chrome 18
[05:12:45] <mikesherov> and the PR actually hardens the reliableMarginRight check
[05:13:04] <mikesherov> not that anyone asked for a fix
[05:14:50] <mikesherov_> back
[05:15:10] <DaveMethvin> i'll close https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/728
[05:15:10] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (2d, 10h ago): fixes #11443 CHECKCLONE AND APPENDCHECKED TEST FAILURES IN CHROME 18
[05:16:40] <mikesherov_> wait no
[05:17:11] <mikesherov_> we're checking chrome 16 in the unit tests
[05:17:12] <mikesherov_> it's silly
[05:17:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah that needs to be dealt with
[05:17:35] <mikesherov_> and that PR dealt with it
[05:17:41] <mikesherov_> oh, nvm
[05:17:46] <mikesherov_> I see what you're saying
[05:17:49] <DaveMethvin> by changing it to 18
[05:18:00] <mikesherov_> that it's silly to have to keep updating those
[05:18:05] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[05:18:44] <mikesherov_> hmmmph
[05:18:53] <mikesherov_> but it's also saving bytes too
[05:19:12] <mikesherov_> OK, maybe I'll just roll up the good parts into another PR
[05:20:08] <DaveMethvin> if you want i can reopen
[05:21:38] <mikesherov> well, I don't really want to waste your cycles over this
[05:21:51] <mikesherov> but I'm just wondering what the correct solution is here.
[05:22:04] <mikesherov> Just remove the chrome test?
[05:22:19] <mikesherov> because they release too fast for us to naturally keep up?
[05:22:25] <DaveMethvin> it was fixed in 18?
[05:22:47] <mikesherov> yes, those two feature detects are now RIGHTFULLY true in Chrome 18
[05:22:58] <DaveMethvin> ok then let's just remove
[05:23:13] <DaveMethvin> by the time 1.8 ships we'll be okay
[05:23:20] <mikesherov> right
[05:23:33] <mikesherov> let me just explain my reasoning why it makes sense to maintain these
[05:23:47] <mikesherov> it gives us clarity into what support tests become archaic
[05:24:03] <mikesherov> maybe that's not a strong enough reason
[05:24:32] <mikesherov> but it told me that chrome fixed something
[05:24:41] <mikesherov> which is good knowledge to have
[05:24:54] <mikesherov> so, that's my final input
[05:25:12] <DaveMethvin> my multitasking is failing here
[05:25:33] <DaveMethvin> there's still a merge conflict in that css prefix PR
[05:25:40] <mikesherov> Right
[05:25:46] <mikesherov> that one I haven't finalized yet
[05:25:54] <DaveMethvin> oh sorry
[05:25:57] <mikesherov> I didn't rebase
[05:26:03] <mikesherov> I'll do that now
[05:26:12] <mikesherov> rather than waste time on this chrome 18 nonsense

[05:34:31] <DaveMethvin> yay thanks mikesherov
[05:34:38] <mikesherov> just running tests too to 100% make sure
[05:35:06] <DaveMethvin> i will prefetch
[05:35:27] <mikesherov> yup
[05:36:06] <DaveMethvin> imma put in a bug report on the git tools, plus signs should be red and minus should be green
[05:36:37] <mikesherov> btw, the final impact of that that PR is: (+174) jquery.min.js.gz
[05:36:45] <mikesherov> so I still have 300 in the bank
[05:38:48] <DaveMethvin> gnarf said he might need a couple hundred for effects
[05:38:54] <DaveMethvin> and the car keys
[05:39:36] <mikesherov> well, I also committed to helping him dry it out if need be
[05:39:41] <mikesherov> css and effects are like bffs
[05:40:38] <mikesherov> tests pass in chrome
[05:40:45] <DaveMethvin> confirmed
[05:40:54] <mikesherov> just checking FF, as that's the tricky one
[05:41:08] <DaveMethvin> chrome is my go-to sanity check browser b/c it is fast
[05:41:37] <mikesherov> yeah
[05:43:24] <mikesherov> FF passes
[05:43:39] <mikesherov> I'm confident the rebase was correct
[05:44:43] <mikesherov> g2g, let me know if there are any issues

[08:10:19] <gnarf> yeah
[08:10:28] <gnarf> im a little upset at the +300 im sitting at right now
[08:10:34] <gnarf> i was sure it would be smaller
[08:10:53] <gnarf> but either way, its definitely more robust
[08:11:34] <gnarf> I have 99% of tests passing in chrome
[08:33:25] <gnarf> hrm...  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10045613/alternative-to-jquery-when-just-requiring-dom-traversal-ajax-deferred
[08:35:58] <ajpiano> lol
[08:36:01] <ajpiano> so he isn't using events?
[08:38:03] <gnarf> i guess not
[08:38:04] <gnarf> :)
[08:39:21] <gnarf> ajpiano: want to review my giant chunk of Animation code? :)
[08:40:40] <ajpiano> if you want animations to break, then sure
[08:41:23] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/compare/master...1.8-effects ;)
[08:41:49] <gnarf> i really need to base those against the 1.8 branch still, luckilly right now only one file has changed
[08:42:57] <gnarf> so I think I can save some more bytes if I make the new "Tweener" just be a reworked "fx"
[08:43:08] <gnarf> also, plugs some back compat back in
[08:43:36] <gnarf> but - just so you know
[08:44:03] <gnarf> working with this code - you can write/say "tweener" like 10 times a day
[08:44:06] <gnarf> that has to be a bonus
[08:44:11] <ajpiano> haha
[08:48:00] <gnarf> it passes like 99% of the units right now
[08:48:25] <gnarf> the only failling unit is the support for the old jQuery.fx() stuff
[08:49:03] <gnarf> sadly, i'm at like +350 right now
[08:49:09] <gnarf> gzipped
[08:49:15] <gnarf> i feel like a byte whore
[08:50:13] <ajpiano> i feel like, you should just get it to where it works then we can go crazy on golfing it down after
[08:50:37] <gnarf> well 99% units passing is "works" right now
[08:50:41] <ajpiano> yea
[08:51:29] <ajpiano> gnarf: the +350b is after min/gzip ?
[08:51:33] <gnarf> yup
[08:51:47] <ajpiano> ahh ohh
[08:51:58] <gnarf> but i've added like 2 hook points to the animation sequence
[08:52:45] <gnarf> it should be possible to write an animation plugin that can skip all of the core "tweens" and go directly to CSS3 transitions and jQuery will never be the wiser
[08:54:44] <gnarf> bbiab, walking into work
[14:15:03] <chee> oops sry about that
[16:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I see a few spots where you can drop some bytes, but that view doesn't allow comments and I don't want to dig through individual commits right now.
[16:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> Also jQuery.Tween.propHooks -> jQuery.tweenHooks.
[16:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, kinda reminds me of https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/6245ecb2b91cca73f66dc0543beb6626c138bcfc

[17:19:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: feel free to compile a list of lines/comments based on a commit id
[17:19:20] <gnarf> i can work from there
[17:19:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but yeah - i think im gonna drop jQuery.Tween
[17:19:41] <gnarf> and just re-refactor it to behave as jQuery.fx
[17:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that sounds good.
[17:20:25] <gnarf> its basically the same thing
[17:21:12] <gnarf> its the only failing unit test right now -- the fact that jQuery.fx() doesn't do what it expects
[17:21:32] <gnarf> also - need to think about prefilter shit too
[17:21:49] <gnarf> cuz like there are a few "injection points" there that need to be available
[17:21:58] <gnarf> but I REALLY like how that show/hide prefilter worked
[17:22:16] <gnarf> the "first" prefilter defined should probably not be a preFilter
[17:22:51] <gnarf> and the "core" preFilters should probably run after user defined by default
[17:26:39] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: fyi, issue143 (maybe obvious or not) needs a new db, since `useragents` is gone now
[17:26:44] <Krinkle> there's a lot depending on that
[17:26:52] <Krinkle> but the branch is stable now
[17:26:57] <Krinkle> gonna merge tonight or tomorrow
