[15:15:53] <terrycojones> Is there any way to find out if there's a plan to modify jQuery deferreds to adhere to Promises/A+?  Each time I ask here there's no reply…..  Is there someone specific I could ask that question of?
[15:31:18] <dcherman> terrycojones: doubtful, considering even conforming fully to Promises/A was rejected.  http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11010
[15:32:16] * terrycojones reads...
[15:34:37] <snover> terrycojones: i wish you would stop asking, i feel angry every time this comes up :)
[15:35:03] <terrycojones> snover: lol, i take it all back.
[15:41:52] <snover> i told julian to make it spec compliant from the start, so it is very frustrating to hear that we are exactly where i knew it would end up when that didn’t happen
[15:45:56] <snover> it’s non-conforming with the dom promises spec too, so it is inevitablet hat sooner or later it will end up needing to be changed and break jquery user code
[15:53:57] <terrycojones> snover: thanks… i'm not sure what to say/think.  i do agree with the comment in that thread that promises/A+ (as opposed to promises/A) has been well thought out. the A version left many things unstated, the A+ version really spells it out.
[15:54:28] <terrycojones> there are 34 promises/A+ compliant implementations (at least).
[15:55:29] <terrycojones> i mailed jaubourg a couple of times & didn't get a reply. i guess i can understand why now :-)
[15:57:15] <terrycojones> snover: i mentioned it before in this channel, i'm almost done writing a book on jQuery deferreds, so I'm trying to make sure i get everything right, including talking about the future, etc.
[15:58:58] <terrycojones> the approach has been to intro people to deferreds (in jquery), show a bunch of examples, and later talk about other things like promises/a+ and why they exist, etc.  i mainly would like to bring deferreds to wider attention, let people know about them in jquery, and point them towards the wider world of deferreds.
[15:59:16] <terrycojones> anyway, thanks again.
[15:59:39] <terrycojones> ah, wait, just got mail back from Julian :-)
