[08:10:41] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: good morning
[08:10:54] <DaveMethvin> hey johnbender
[08:11:17] <johnbender> you know one thing i totally forgot to mention is that creating elements usint `$` is probably part of the issue too
[08:11:22] <johnbender> danzik17: wrt perf
[08:11:42] <johnbender> $'s has this massive type union for it's first param
[08:11:51] <johnbender> -'s
[08:12:06] <johnbender> danzik17: sorry wrong highlight
[08:12:09] <DaveMethvin> its definitely clustered in the creation of widgets, i am seeing a lot of time being spent getting the nearest page data
[08:12:12] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: wrt to perf
[08:12:31] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: that makes sense
[08:12:35] <DaveMethvin> lots of need to traverse up and find out parent data
[08:12:40] <johnbender> for the keep native stuff
[08:12:48] <DaveMethvin> right now that's done with .closest() and complex selectors
[08:13:07] <DaveMethvin> so i think it may be possible to shave that down
[08:13:16] <DaveMethvin> i was looking at it this morning
[08:13:24] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: hmm we can probably do parent node traversal and plane old attribute checks
[08:13:31] <DaveMethvin> yep i t hink so
[08:13:57] <DaveMethvin> i have a coupla hacks in a local version already just to see if it made a diff
[08:14:12] <DaveMethvin> there's still a lot of time being spent in _create for the widgets
[08:14:34] <DaveMethvin> so it's just a case of making changes and doing another profile
[08:14:46] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: man, thanks for taking a look
[08:14:54] <DaveMethvin> sure, i like this kinda thing

[09:43:50] <johnbender> posted something new to my blerg if anyone's interested: http://johnbender.us/2012/02/29/faster-javascript-through-category-theory/
[10:43:29] <David_Souther> So, my co-worker (26) has decided he needs a walker- since $.scope no longer exists, and he is aghast and surprised that it's been superseded by $.proxy
