[16:56:56] <Nikita_> hello everyone! I am new here. Can anyone help me get started? I want to get assigned a bug to be fixed.
[17:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> Nikita_: Generally bugs aren't assigned to community members. If there's a bug you'd like to work on, just leave a comment on the issue saying you're working on it.
[17:07:40] <Nikita_> okay
[17:08:34] <Nikita_> where can i get the list of reported bugs?
[17:12:35] <DaveMethvin> Nikita_: the current open issues are at https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues
[17:22:52] <Nikita_> got it!
[17:22:58] <Nikita_> thankyou
