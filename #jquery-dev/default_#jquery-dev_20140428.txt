[08:49:40] <ajpiano> http://julian.com/research/velocity/
[08:49:44] <ajpiano> interesting.....
[09:04:55] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: meeting?
[09:05:30] <DaveMethvin> yup i hope!
[09:05:43] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: you around?
[09:05:57] <timmywil> yea
[09:06:15] <DaveMethvin> really i don't have much to talk about this week, but wanted to get the final of the .1 releases out this week if possible
[09:06:20] <DaveMethvin> markelog got his ticket done
[09:06:24] <DaveMethvin> mine is simple too
[09:06:27] <DaveMethvin> and that's pretty much it
[09:06:42] <DaveMethvin> i should be able to do the release from my shiny new VM
[09:07:11] <DaveMethvin> then i'd like to get 1.12/2.2 planning started
[09:07:52] <timmywil> ok, I need to get on the Sizzle insurance. Sorry I didn't have much time in San Fran.
[09:08:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's not a blocker so no biggie
[09:08:13] <DaveMethvin> i hope you had fun!
[09:08:26] <DaveMethvin> some interesting stuff in that Veolocity code, maybe we can get gnarf to take a look and think about changes we could pick
[09:08:38] <timmywil> It was great.
[09:08:44] <DaveMethvin> at the very least bring back rAF
[09:09:47] <DaveMethvin> so how about we do the 1.12/2.2 stuff async since so few people are here ... i'll send out a message and review the tickets we have, and create new ones if needed
[09:09:59] <timmywil> ok
[09:10:11] <DaveMethvin> anything you wanted to discuss m_gol ?
[09:10:21] <m_gol> present
[09:10:27] <m_gol> sorry, didn't see the notification
[09:10:29] <m_gol> 2 PRs for sizzle
[09:10:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah saw those
[09:10:52] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/259 & https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/260
[09:12:04] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure timmywil and gibson042 will want to look too ... the whole peerDependencies thing, ugh
[09:12:11] <m_gol> yeah, they'll go away
[09:12:22] <m_gol> actually, I was surprised to discover it works not only as a check
[09:12:28] <m_gol> but it actually installs deps
[09:12:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's what i thought it did too
[09:12:36] <m_gol> IMO it's 99% of all the reasons why it fails
[09:12:46] <m_gol> if it just checked, we wouldn't have this mess
[09:13:35] <DaveMethvin> ok then, i'll plan on doing the final later this week for 1.11.1 and 2.1.1
[09:13:42] <m_gol> \o/
[09:13:51] <DaveMethvin> then we'll start planning on the real fun stuff
[09:14:01] <DaveMethvin> BREAK THINGS!
[09:14:08] <m_gol> timmywil gibson042: will you have some time to glance at those PR? it's test/build stuff only, nothing major
[09:14:16] <m_gol> * PR -> PRs
[09:14:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah you can land that whenever it's convenient, except for Thursday in the middle of the release :)
[09:14:52] <m_gol> :)
[09:15:00] <m_gol> is https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1566 for 2.2/1.12?
[09:15:21] <DaveMethvin> no it's for the .1 releases
[09:15:32] <timmywil> I saw them. They looked fine.
[09:15:36] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to review and then we can land
[09:15:44] <DaveMethvin> 1566 that is
[09:16:15] <DaveMethvin> in 1.12 i want to see if we can tear out some of the defaultDisplay magic
[09:16:25] <DaveMethvin> esp the getDefaultDisplayStyle stuff that only works in Firefox
[09:17:23] <DaveMethvin> we need to push people away from magic stuff like getting dimensions/position on hidden elements or hide/show on things that have ever-changing styles
[09:18:33] <DaveMethvin> ok that's all for me ... ping me in -dev if you need anything, i shoudl be around this week
[09:18:40] <m_gol> I wish there was a way to deprecate the magic behind appending px...
[09:18:52] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: we're in -dev :P
[09:19:08] <DaveMethvin> oh DUH
[09:19:18] <m_gol> meeting stealth mode
[09:19:21] <DaveMethvin> well i meant to be in -meeting
[09:19:40] <DaveMethvin> good thing I didn't +m this room!
[09:19:49] <m_gol> :D
[09:19:59] <DaveMethvin> alright then i'm staying put!
[09:21:18] <DaveMethvin> haha gibson042 you're just too late
[09:21:25] <DaveMethvin> i ended up chatting here
[09:22:08] <gibson042> at least I have the tools to catch up :)
[09:25:56] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: ping
[11:48:48] <mousemke> what gets overwritten to give $('.aClass') the same behavior as $('.aClass').get()?
[11:50:53] <m_gol> mousemke: support in #jquery
[11:51:18] <mousemke> k thnx

[13:34:12] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[13:35:36] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[13:36:26] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: am I ok to use jQuery.cleanData in outside projects?
[13:36:49] <m_gol> I mean, I'm trying to end the terrible mess that is current Angular scary monkey-patching jQuery methods like .remove/.empty etc.
[13:36:56] <DaveMethvin> well jQueryUI uses it so ... its quasi-public
[13:37:00] <m_gol> they did some horrible things with that, it had bugs etc.
[13:37:07] <DaveMethvin> there's a ticket to make it more formal
[13:37:12] <DaveMethvin> lemme find that
[13:37:14] <m_gol> and they only need to be able to trigger the $destroy event on those elements
[13:37:26] <DaveMethvin> right that's the most common case
[13:37:34] <m_gol> so I want to switch their impl. to just monkey-patching jQuery.cleanData like jQuery UI does
[13:38:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think that is safe compared to other ugly solutions
[13:38:12] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12213
[13:38:26] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: look at this monster: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/jqLite.js#L139-180
[13:39:04] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[13:39:16] <m_gol> before I patched it it didn't even consider that .remove() could accept a selector argument
[13:39:21] <m_gol> so it was removing too much
[13:39:22] <m_gol> etc.
[13:39:32] <DaveMethvin> cleanData is def better
[13:39:52] <DaveMethvin> and since UI uses it I suspect we wouldn't remove it
[13:39:53] <m_gol> ok, that's what I thought, just wanted to make sure since it's not documented currently
[13:40:10] <DaveMethvin> it's a solid use case to want to known when elements go away
[13:40:24] <DaveMethvin> assuming all the code goes through jQuery/jQLite
[13:40:33] <m_gol> yep, that's the case
[13:40:48] <m_gol> if jQuery is included, all goes through jQuery; otherwise through it's little jqLite
[13:40:55] <m_gol> * it's -> its
[13:43:13] <m_gol> monkey-patching such things is dangerous :)
[13:43:35] <m_gol> a new signature appears, someone uses it and happy debugging then why it's doing weird things!

[20:50:05] <Sharperte> I have ap roblem with my javascript using jquery. The idea is to read from a text file line by line and display inside the Latest News red box of demo3 the lines and make them scroll up. Instead each few seconds its adding another new Latest News red box with all the text content of the text file. And not scrolling up only 2 lines each time.

[20:50:24] <Sharperte> You can see it on my site: http://newsxpressmedia.com/test.html
[20:50:35] <Sharperte> Each some seconds a new red box with Latest News is adding like append with the whole text file content and its not scrolling. 
[20:50:43] <Sharperte> Where is the problem with the code ?
