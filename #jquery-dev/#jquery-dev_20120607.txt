[06:07:29] <scott_gonzalez> sindresorhus: Should #11873 be closed as duplicate?
[06:10:00] <sindresorhus> scott_gonzalez:  Don't think so, but not sure. Since they committ I referred to fixed a bug in Firefox, but this one is referred to as bug in Chrome
[06:10:57] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...so it was a bug that's now fixed?
[06:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> The ticket doesn't seem invalid, it's either dup, works, fixed.
[06:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> It could be pending for a test case :-)
[06:13:26] <sindresorhus> In my mind it was invalid since the code he removed that he said fixed it was already removed in edge
[06:13:52] <sindresorhus> If you think it's wrong, please feel free to set it to whatever ;)

[06:26:17] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: you know, its a reasonable choice in this particular context
[06:27:03] <rwaldron> jzaefferer maybe so, but I think we could accomplish the same goals with something lighter
[06:27:18] <jzaefferer> like what?
[06:27:21] <rwaldron> of course, it would require a complete change
[06:27:53] <rwaldron> ben_alman and I chatted briefly
[06:28:21] <rwaldron> yaml would be nice
[06:28:25] <rwaldron> generate some markdown
[06:28:33] <rwaldron> I'm not asking to change the system
[06:28:42] <rwaldron> as you saw, I had no issue filling in api
[06:28:53] <rwaldron> i just like to make fun of xml :D
[06:29:23] <jzaefferer> that's never wrong :-)
[06:29:34] <jzaefferer> And there's more work to do on the QUnit docs ;)
[06:29:40] <rwaldron> i know
[06:29:42] <rwaldron> haha
[06:30:16] <rwaldron> jzaefferer http://gyazo.com/c9f6041d6fa7702f09dff6f1ee4c4c4a
[06:30:18] <rwaldron> <3
[06:30:18] <rwaldron> :D
[06:31:22] <rwaldron> jzaefferer I'm going to work on these this AM
[06:31:46] <rwaldron> are you also working on it? I'm just curious - don't want to duplicate efforts
[06:32:02] <jzaefferer> nope, just that one commit I mentioned, working on UI docs currently
[06:32:07] <rwaldron> great
[06:32:20] <rwaldron> i'll use stop.xml as a guide for what needs to be done
[06:32:24] <rwaldron> thanks for filling that out
[06:33:06] <jzaefferer> unrelated but true: http://i.imgur.com/c1UYw.jpg
[06:35:18] <rwaldron> hahaha
[06:35:28] <rwaldron> pull --rebase?
[06:35:42] <rwaldron> is there a shorthand for inline code?
[06:35:49] <rwaldron> eg. `asyncTest`
[06:36:02] <rwaldron> or do I have to write out <code>asyncTest</code>
[06:36:14] <rwaldron> jzaefferer ^
[06:36:32] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: I believe you have to write it out.
[06:36:39] <scott_gonzalez> In XML?
[06:36:59] <scott_gonzalez> Or on the main site?
[06:37:01] <jzaefferer> We could add some custom processing to replace backtickets with <code>
[06:37:18] <jzaefferer> Currently needs to be written out
[06:37:54] <rwaldron> ok
[06:38:03] <rwaldron> I'll just write it out
[06:38:08] <rwaldron> less technical debt
[07:10:04] <ralphholzmann> rwaldron DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez http://jsperf.com/jquery-event-fix/6 - yeilds 5x increase in android 4.0.x, 4.4x in iOS 5 iPad, 5x in iOS 5 iPhone
[07:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> ralphholzmann: Thanks.
[07:12:09] <scott_gonzalez> Can you test http://view.jqueryui.com/interactions/demos/draggable/default.html in whatever devices were too slow for you?
[07:13:50] <ralphholzmann> sure
[07:16:18] <rwaldron> ralphholzmann we've actually been discussing something even more radical
[07:16:30] <rwaldron> ...just using the event object.
[07:16:42] <rwaldron> in webkit, it's mutable.
[07:16:56] <ralphholzmann> interesting
[07:17:00] <rwaldron> we would then only have to "fix" it in oldIE
[07:17:06] <ralphholzmann> right
[07:17:07] <rwaldron> (also mutable in FF)
[07:17:09] <ralphholzmann> less code
[07:17:11] <ralphholzmann> as well
[07:17:13] <rwaldron> much less
[07:17:47] <rwaldron> ralphholzmann I dont want you to think your research was for nothing
[07:17:57] <rwaldron> you definitely made us take another look
[07:18:05] <ralphholzmann> rwaldron: not at all
[07:18:15] <ralphholzmann> cool, i appreciate it
[07:18:16] <rwaldron> I have a branch that uses the original event object and passes all the tests
[07:18:28] <rwaldron> and its because you guys pushed us to look harder
[07:18:28] <ralphholzmann> oooh
[07:18:32] <rwaldron> :)
[07:18:39] <ralphholzmann> woot =)
[07:18:58] <rwaldron> but we wont be using Object.defineProperty approach, sorry
[07:19:10] <ralphholzmann> its all good in the hood
[07:19:20] <ralphholzmann> better perf is what we're all after, I think
[07:19:22] <rwaldron> I think you can agree this is infinitely better
[07:19:24] <ralphholzmann> thats what matters
[07:19:25] <ralphholzmann> yeah
[07:19:31] <rwaldron> there wont be any "fix" on mobile now
[07:19:36] <rwaldron> which is AWESOME
[07:19:43] <ralphholzmann> yeaaaah man
[07:19:47] <ralphholzmann> my phonegap app thanks you
[07:20:02] <rwaldron> Jupiter/Bitovi will definitely get credit for lighting the fire
[07:20:10] <rwaldron> ok... back to qunit api docs
[07:20:14] * rwaldron sighs
[07:20:17] <rwaldron> <3

[07:21:26] <jqcommit> [qunit] jzaefferer pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/FEqupw
[07:21:26] <jqcommit> [qunit/master] Release 1.7.0 - Jörn Zaefferer
[07:21:26] <jqcommit> [qunit/master] Bump post-release version - Jörn Zaefferer
[07:22:04] <rwaldron> jzaefferer i have a thought
[07:22:16] <rwaldron> the (not) functions... do they really need their own pages?
[07:22:26] <rwaldron> they dont even get their own tests
[07:22:31] <rwaldron> in qunit/test/
[07:22:52] <rwaldron> could they be mentioned on their respective posi-test
[07:23:16] <rwaldron> eg. deepEqual would have a section that was for notDeepEqual
[07:23:26] <rwaldron> it would reduce the number of pages we need to maintain
[07:23:44] <rwaldron> I've already done notDeepEqual, notEqual
[07:23:50] <jq-jenkins> Project QUnit build #135: SUCCESS in 2 min 26 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/QUnit/135/
[07:23:51] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Release 1.7.0
[07:23:51] <jq-jenkins> * joern.zaefferer: Bump post-release version
[07:24:40] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: I'm totally okay with that. I really don't care about those methods anyway...
[07:24:46] <rwaldron> hahaha
[07:24:47] <rwaldron> ok
[07:25:09] <rwaldron> also... describing "notDeepEqual" is AWKWARD
[07:25:13] <rwaldron> because deepEqual is a special case
[07:25:20] <rwaldron> that can do objects, arrays, etc.
[07:25:37] <rwaldron> so like.. _anything_ else is implicitly "not deep equal"
[07:25:49] <rwaldron> "equal" is "not deep equal"
[07:25:59] <rwaldron> hopefully that makes sense
[07:26:05] <rwaldron> I'm going to re-org this
[07:26:07] <rwaldron> thanks!
[07:26:34] <jzaefferer> this is pretty funny: http://textfromxcode.tumblr.com/
[07:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> I've gotta know. Does bzbarsky actually follow jQuery PRs or did someone ping him?
[07:31:17] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: he was pinged in the initial PR
[07:31:25] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[07:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> Boris is my favorite browser dev :-)
[07:32:07] <DaveMethvin> man i have to brush up on my ticket trolling
[07:32:23] <scott_gonzalez> Seriously DaveMethvin. You need a better response about a.
[07:32:26] <DaveMethvin> i am being way to subtle
[07:33:29] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can just check if everything is defined before using it.
[08:04:14] <rwaldron> jzaefferer drafts of docs finished
[08:04:18] <rwaldron> minus the events
[08:04:26] <rwaldron> I think those belong on one page
[08:04:32] <rwaldron> not sure
[08:04:45] <rwaldron> I need to break from this for now

[08:30:12] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez I can't tell if you're serious " Boris is my favorite browser dev :-)"
[08:30:23] <scott_gonzalez> I am
[08:30:57] <rwaldron> I can never decide if I like him or not
[08:31:07] <rwaldron> more frequently he's great and right
[08:31:13] <rwaldron> and a killer voice of reason
[08:31:29] <scott_gonzalez> He's like a tamer Mark Pilgrim :-P
[08:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> But I love Mark as well, so...
[08:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> Boris has a crazy amount of knowledge.
[08:33:03] <rwaldron> I butted heads over Firefox adhering to the spec w/r to the media element currentTime BS. the spec was doing it wrong, every other browser was doing something to account for that wrongness, but he insisted that it was ok that FF had this ghastly behaviour, because it was in the spec
[08:33:18] <rwaldron> it's like... are you trolling me.. OR hixie - BY PROXY??
[08:33:20] <rwaldron> hahaha
[08:33:26] <rwaldron> like.. i will stick to this broken ass spec
[08:33:31] <rwaldron> to make an example
[08:33:53] <rwaldron> Mozilla is trying to get Boris to work on tool development
[08:34:00] <rwaldron> because he debugs like no one else
[08:34:59] <paul_irish> well the profiler dropped like 6 days ago

[10:58:22] <jzaefferer> ?tell rwaldron great work on the QUnit docs, much appreciated
[10:58:22] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[11:19:01] <jzaefferer> gnarf Krinkle: between the three of us, can we fix the jQuery Core Jenkins job?
[11:19:13] <Krinkle> who's the third
[11:19:16] <Krinkle> gnarf:
[11:19:21] <Krinkle> Yes, I suppose we can
[11:19:49] <jzaefferer> well, I can leave it to you two, too :p
[11:20:17] <Krinkle> * get rid of ./git/, * get rid of chekcout_sha1.sh, * have jenkins execute shell command to rsync the jenkins working directory to swarm/build/{project}/{sha1}
[11:20:19] <Krinkle> that should do it
[11:20:29] <Krinkle> (for all projects, not just core)
[11:20:34] <Krinkle> but we can start with just core
[11:20:41] <jzaefferer> okay
[11:20:51] <jzaefferer> that means we'd have to update paths in grunt.js's testswarm task?
[11:20:55] <Krinkle> I already created an empty ./build directory in htdocs
[11:21:14] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: possibly, I'm not sure
[11:21:27] <Krinkle> I'm hoping this is not hardcoded in the repo itself, this is really a server side thing.
[11:21:27] <jzaefferer> if the path for swarm changes, then yeah
[11:21:50] * Krinkle checks
[11:21:55] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/grunt.js
[11:21:55] <jzaefferer> currently it is: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/grunt.js#L137
[11:22:02] <jzaefferer> which is totally my fault ;)
[11:22:09] <Krinkle> testUrls.push
[11:22:11] <Krinkle> Hm..
[11:22:18] <jzaefferer> but that's also easy to fix, we can just add more properties to that configFile
[11:22:27] <Krinkle> yeah
[11:22:29] <jzaefferer> already contains usernames and passwords for swarm, might also contain paths
[11:22:39] <Krinkle> like... all properties (almost) ?
[11:23:15] <jzaefferer> replace "http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery/" with config.jquery.testUrl orsomething
[11:23:40] <jzaefferer> well, swarm url itself, too
[11:23:44] <jzaefferer> the rest seems fine
[11:23:45] <Krinkle> indeed
[11:23:53] <Krinkle> sure, rest can wait
[11:23:58] <Krinkle> I was thinking authUsername as well
[11:24:08] <Krinkle> but whatever
[11:24:18] <jzaefferer> swarmUrl, testUrl
[11:24:24] <Krinkle> enough for now
[11:24:24] <jzaefferer> I can get that done
[11:24:32] <Krinkle> great
[11:25:16] <jzaefferer> can you write a shell command for the rsync stuff?
[11:25:49] <gnarf> seems like a good plan ^^^^
[11:26:11] <gnarf> jenkins runs grunt, rsyncs the folder to the htdocs for swarm
[11:26:17] <gnarf> then submits job?
[11:26:39] <jzaefferer> yeah
[11:26:45] <gnarf> +!
[11:29:48] <Krinkle> yes
[11:29:51] <jzaefferer> I'm updating that config file, then will push an update for core to use those extra properties
[11:29:56] <gnarf> so long as the "settings" for those locations are in a config file
[11:30:00] <gnarf> we should be good
[11:30:01] <gnarf> also
[11:30:03] <gnarf> insterestingly
[11:30:21] <gnarf> it would allow us to submit jobs from our local PC's if we had proper keys to get into rsync ;)
[11:30:50] <gnarf> like a "gnarf's effects change test swarm build" would be possible
[11:30:54] <Krinkle> I'm currently fixing a unit test on mediawiki, I'll get on this in a few minutes.
[11:34:14] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, I am in love with jQuery Promise: http://dpaste.com/756446/
[11:34:51] <Krinkle> The power of 'always' combined with '$.when' is unmatched.
[11:36:46] <jqcommit> [jquery] jzaefferer pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/0Fbfbw
[11:36:46] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Grunt: Update testswarm task to use more config properties. Already deployed on Jenkins server - Jörn Zaefferer
[11:37:04] <jzaefferer> Deferreds are pretty nice :-)
[11:37:14] <jzaefferer> And there's the update for Core's grunt.js
[11:37:24] <Krinkle> k, logging into jenkins and swarm01 now
[11:43:22] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: To avoid duplication by putting it in the raw jenkins exec for each project, I'm creating ./srv-swarm/tools/publish-jenkins-working-copy.sh
[11:43:25] <Krinkle> just fyi
[11:46:12] <jzaefferer> okay
[11:46:33] <jzaefferer> as we do this step by step, we can remove the old bash script once we're done migrating all projects
[11:46:56] <jzaefferer> you should reuse the cleanup from the existing script
[11:47:04] <jzaefferer> delete everything that's older than a week or something like that
[11:48:18] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I am reusing that indeed
[11:48:24] <Krinkle> changed the outdated from 31 to 14 for now
[11:48:30] <Krinkle> tested from cli just now, seems to work

[11:55:20] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: okay, I'm swapping the 'git fetch; checkout_sha1' executable shell entry in jquery-core jerkins for this one:
[11:55:21] <jzaefferer> why is that test failing?

[11:56:19] <jzaefferer> I'm getting one failure
[11:56:23] <jzaefferer> whatever
[11:56:26] <jzaefferer> my Chrome sucks
[11:56:38] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: why pass that first argument? Just put it into the script
[11:56:49] <jzaefferer> less trouble then repeating that in each job
[11:57:02] <Krinkle> I'll create an additional argument for project then
[11:57:02] <jzaefferer> err
[11:57:03] <jzaefferer> nevermind
[11:57:08] <jzaefferer> well
[11:57:08] <jzaefferer> yeah
[11:57:15] <jzaefferer> just for project, but not the full path

[12:06:16] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: okay, working now http://swarm.jquery.org/build/jquery/0344a390b7673e2f014dc120a4cc5d3492731369/test/index.html?filter=ajax
[12:06:20] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/225
[12:08:25] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I suppose this might also speed up IE with its crappy concurrent download stuff
[12:08:36] <Krinkle> since it now only downloads 1 js for jquery core
[12:08:46] <Krinkle> instead of all separately (did it do that?)(
[12:09:04] <Krinkle> meh, I guess PHP concatenated them
[12:13:14] <Krinkle> IE6 done in < 10 minutes
[12:28:41] <jzaefferer> nice
[12:32:50] <jzaefferer> ?tell DaveMethvin Jenkins job is back up (kudos to Krinkle!) - now fix (or exclude) those failures!
[12:32:51] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[12:33:07] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: it is basically done now (in 28 minutes)
[12:33:13] <Krinkle> but some ajax tests are still repeating
[12:33:23] <Krinkle> probably won't make it
[12:33:28] <Krinkle> (for jenkins)
[12:36:01] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Core build #117: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/117/

[12:47:22] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: is $.when documented to accept an array of promise objects /
[12:47:28] <Krinkle> I don't see it, but should it?
[13:04:29] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: my love towards $.when is declining, can you help out? http://dpaste.com/756467/
[13:04:45] <Krinkle> I need a callback when all 3 are done
[13:05:06] <Krinkle> but $.when fires 'fail' if one of the promises is rejected, even when others are pending
[13:05:12] <Krinkle> is there a "complete" or something ?
[13:05:30] <Krinkle> s/done/finished
[13:06:02] <Krinkle> I expect one of the three to fail
[13:06:19] <Krinkle> the === 3 hack I tried there doesn't work either, ignore that
[13:20:23] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: okay, I solved it this way: http://dpaste.com/756475/ - maybe you have a better idea?
[14:27:18] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[14:45:38] <mikesherov> rwaldron: !
[14:46:12] <mikesherov> you here?
[14:48:31] <rwaldron> I am
[14:48:38] <rwaldron> I'm bisecting for a fourth time
[14:49:05] <rwaldron> I have a feeling i had a good bisect from a cached build
[14:49:18] <rwaldron> so, I'm doing this as painfully as possible
[14:49:39] <rwaldron> its paying off
[14:49:46] <mikesherov> yeah, I'm seeing the same failure
[14:49:48] <rwaldron> bisect went a different direction
[14:50:43] <rwaldron> I was missing these for the last 4-5 days because I've been testing -effects
[14:50:50] <rwaldron> ya know... to put it through the paces
[14:51:39] <rwaldron> my suspicion and patience paid off
[14:51:44] <rwaldron> mikesherov ^^
[14:52:07] <rwaldron> gnarf yt?
[14:52:16] <rwaldron> please ping, urgent-ish
[14:52:22] <mikesherov> rwaldron, was it me?
[14:52:25] <rwaldron> no
[14:52:29] <rwaldron> animation rewrite
[14:52:37] <rwaldron> definitively
[14:52:52] <mikesherov> hmm, no specific commit?
[14:53:02] <rwaldron> 58ed62ed12cb48d9224f699e86e197804ca5ece4
[14:53:06] <rwaldron> the animation rewrite
[14:53:14] <rwaldron> it was squashed
[14:53:37] <mikesherov> hrmmm.
[14:53:40] <mikesherov> I can look into as well
[14:54:01] <rwaldron> of course, it's not on gnarf, we'll all work through it.
[14:54:33] <mikesherov> Probably should ping gibson042 as well
[14:54:46] <rwaldron> he's not here?
[14:55:17] <mikesherov> I mean in general
[14:55:23] <rwaldron> yeah
[14:55:29] <mikesherov> he has great understanding of effects code
[14:55:32] <rwaldron> i dont know why that was a question
[14:58:31] <rwaldron> mikesherov i've emailed everyone involved, we'll work this out
[14:58:36] <rwaldron> plenty of time
[14:58:47] <rwaldron> I feel like I have DaveMethvin composure right now...
[14:58:53] <rwaldron> that never happens
[15:01:29] <mikesherov> sorry, got disconnected
