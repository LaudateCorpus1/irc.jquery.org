[06:49:59] <Krinkle> Could anyone take a look at this ? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/141
[06:50:22] <Krinkle> Would be nice to have that in so I can use it in my projects without risking to get pull/merge conflicts
[07:46:55] <Krinkle> fyi: logos are broken here http://jquery.org/sponsors/
[08:46:40] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Perhaps you can review/comment and/or pull this one in ? https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/141
[08:48:38] <jzaefferer> yeah, will do; there was another ticket about autoreloading the page, would be nice if this change would allow that kind of customization
