[05:32:20] <m_gol> paul_irish: I was actually on vacation. :) Thanks for quick fixes!
[07:01:57] <scott_gonzalez> Are we seriously considering just flat out breaking our API? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14117
[07:31:38] <snover> doesnâ€™t look like it :)
[09:12:01] <clorenzo> Hey, I believe that the sourcemap is pointing wrong for the cdnjs version of jquery 2.0.3
[09:12:10] <clorenzo> http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js
[09:12:16] <clorenzo> it should be jquery.min.map right?
[09:13:31] <m_gol> clorenzo: right, uhh
[09:13:51] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, did sth in a release script get messed up? :/
[09:14:12] <clorenzo> -.-;;
[09:14:13] <m_gol> ahh, a moment, what CDN is that, clorenzo?
[09:14:17] <clorenzo> cdnjs
[09:14:43] <m_gol> well, that's probably their fault, they changed file names and they didn't change file contents
[09:14:50] <m_gol> Google CDN has a correct file: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js
[09:15:01] <clorenzo> yeah, just thought I would give a heads up
[09:15:07] <clorenzo> should I email them?
[09:15:15] <m_gol> yep, asap ;)
[09:15:27] <m_gol> since anyone that has already downloaded the file will always have the wrong one
[09:16:02] <clorenzo> alright
[09:16:16] <m_gol> `tell DaveMethvin we should press hard for a quick introduction of `@hasImplicitSourceMap` to the spec, we're constantly getting incorrect map file names, see http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js
[09:16:17] <b-ot> m_gol: Iâ€™ll tell DaveMethvin about that.
[09:17:01] <m_gol> `tell DaveMethvin damn, wrong URL: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js
[09:17:02] <b-ot> m_gol: Iâ€™ll tell DaveMethvin about that.
[09:17:31] <m_gol> `tell DaveMethvin I'll go kill myself, wrong again... This is the correct one: http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.0.3/jquery.min.js
[09:17:32] <b-ot> m_gol: Iâ€™ll tell DaveMethvin about that.
[09:21:30] <snover> man, if people canâ€™t debug their cdn jquery they might need to switch temporarily to another version :(
[09:22:14] <m_gol> or use different CDN ;)
[09:22:38] <m_gol> I don't like the way source map location is specified
[09:22:58] <snover> how would you like it?
[09:23:03] <m_gol> it breaks a natural assumption that groups of files can have batch-renamed file name prefixes safely
[09:23:28] <m_gol> I mean, currently the minified file points to the map file and vice versa
[09:24:04] <m_gol> configuration should preferably be outside of the minified file in a JSON file
[09:24:32] <m_gol> but, well, the `@hasImplicitSourceMapURL` would solve 90% of those problems as well so be it
[09:26:27] <m_gol> `tell DaveMethvin I replied once again, could you reply, too? we seem to have to press them a little harder... https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap/rIt4kvlC6GI
[09:26:27] <b-ot> m_gol: Iâ€™ll tell DaveMethvin about that.
[09:27:23] <snover> why should it be .map instead of .js.map?
[09:28:57] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Please look up meaning of the word "discarded". I've removed the label from the issues you recently applied it to (it is meant to be used if the issue report is wontfix/duplicate/invalid whatever the reason may be for the issue itself to be discarded)
[09:29:02] <Krinkle> I'm assuming you didn't mean to discard those issues.
[09:29:09] <Krinkle> (as they were still open)
[09:30:56] <m_gol> snover: probably to not have jquery.min.js.map. I don't care, though, I just want this problem to go away.
[09:32:49] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: oops, okay
[10:02:39] <rwaldron> Did "zoom" get removed in the migration to http://contribute.jquery.org/wont-fix/ ?
[10:02:50] <rwaldron> Or am I imagining that we covered that?
[10:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it was in the old won't fix. I'm pretty sure it was only ever mentioned in a ticket.
[10:25:32] <jgornick> Hey guys, looking for some insight to why performance of sortable (draggable) is so poor in IE8/IE9. My fiddle can be found @ http://jsfiddle.net/jgornick/Przxf/72/
[10:26:13] <jgornick> Meh, wrong channel.
[12:13:36] <DaveMethvin> .
[12:13:36] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: You have 4 new messages, use `read when you wish to read them.
[12:13:45] <DaveMethvin> tick ready
[12:13:48] <DaveMethvin> `read

[12:14:08] <DaveMethvin> there ya go
[12:14:32] <DaveMethvin> m_gol yeah they renamed it themselves because they just grabbed it from our CDN

[20:09:15] <JamesMGreene> Sorry for the long absence, guys!  Apparently the newer versions of mIRC actually disable the UI after the trial expires, so I've been running mIRC without any UI for, uhh, a few weeks now.  o_O
