[14:12:23] <arthurvr> Hi dr_ichel 
[14:15:09] <dr_ichel> :) id like to ask a propably stupid question - ive got a website and im using stickUp.js for some sticky Sidebar http://lirancohen.github.io/stickUp/ to make the magic happen i just have to call it on a selector (on doc ready) $('.navbar-wrapper').stickUp();
[14:15:17] <dr_ichel> but this magic should only happen in desktop view
[14:15:42] <arthurvr> This is the jQuery development channel. You will need to ask in #jquery
[14:15:52] <dr_ichel> ah kk ^^ sry then
