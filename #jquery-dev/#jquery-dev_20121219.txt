[05:21:17] <DaveMethvin> over here mikesherov
[05:21:18] <mikesherov> hi DaveMethvin 
[05:21:29] <DaveMethvin> ok lemme try this
[05:22:20] <mikesherov> thanks
[05:25:19] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: got a fail installing lodash
[05:25:33] <mikesherov> oh, that's weird
[05:25:42] <mikesherov> the task I'm mostly concerned with is `custom` because that's a grunt task calling a grunt task using grunt.cmd
[05:25:49] <mikesherov> installing lodash?
[05:25:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah during the npm install
[05:26:13] <mikesherov> hmm, do you have latest node on your machine?
[05:26:21] <mikesherov> are you on 0.8?
[05:26:29] <mikesherov> dependency hell
[05:26:37] <DaveMethvin> 0.8.9
[05:26:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i noticed coffee-script fly by?
[05:26:49] <mikesherov> hmmm, what's the err message?
[05:26:53] <DaveMethvin> `cmd "/c" "node build/post-install"` failed with 127
[05:27:40] <DaveMethvin> npm ERR! command "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node.exe" "C:\\Program Files\\nodejs\\node_modules\\npm\\bin\\npm-cli.js" "install"

[05:27:49] <DaveMethvin> welcome to the hell that is windows
[05:28:01] <mikesherov> someone contact jdalton
[05:28:19] <mikesherov> OK, I gotta go, but that seems to be where the problem is :-\
[05:28:35] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'll look at it
[05:48:21] <scott_gonzalez> Awesome bug report just now contained: `este = $(this)` :-)
[05:48:39] <DaveMethvin> muy bueno
[05:48:57] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i think i figured out the install issue, just need to determine how to test the fix

[15:32:01] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you there?
[15:32:38] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: yep
[15:32:51] <mikesherov> soâ€¦ I saw your lodash fun today
[15:32:58] <mikesherov> is grunt 0.4 working for you now?
[15:33:09] <mikesherov> were you able to verify my PR?
[15:33:09] <DaveMethvin> seems to be working fine now!
[15:33:24] <mikesherov> OK, if that's the case, I'm going to land itâ€¦ cool?
[15:33:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah, nobody complained so do it
[15:33:40] <mikesherov> source maps get put in dist/jquery.source-map.js
[15:33:43] <DaveMethvin> let's get this party started!
[15:33:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah i saw
[15:33:56] <mikesherov> last chance for a bikeshed...
[15:34:14] <DaveMethvin> oh i didn't even THINK about that opportunity
[15:34:21] <DaveMethvin> like, jquery.srcmap.js
[15:34:32] <DaveMethvin> or, jquery-source-map.js
[15:34:38] <mikesherov> or jquery.SRCMAPZ.js
[15:34:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah that last one
[15:34:51] <mikesherov> cool, so I'
[15:34:59] <mikesherov> ll just pretend we didn't have this convo
[15:35:03] <mikesherov> and land as is
[15:35:03] <DaveMethvin> land it as is, we can always do that later

[17:03:02] <mikesherov> Krinkle: do you know how to rerun a jenkins job on jq03?
[17:03:31] <Krinkle> mikesherov: yes
[17:03:36] <Krinkle> mikesherov: jenkins job or testswarm job
[17:03:56] <mikesherov> jenkins
[17:04:14] <mikesherov> I just landed the grunt 0.4 stuff, and Jenkins is complaining
[17:04:15] <Krinkle> log in from web ui and click rerun :)
[17:04:32] <Krinkle> but it is unusual to rerun a jenkins job
[17:04:38] <Krinkle> nothing will change if nothing changed
[17:04:51] <Krinkle> if there is a new commit, it'll create a new build, right?
[17:04:52] <Krinkle> link?
[17:05:06] <mikesherov> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/588/
[17:05:28] <mikesherov> I think the Jenkins build process relies on a global Grunt, which it shouldn't
[17:05:50] <Krinkle> Indeed, so be sure to add grunt-cli to npm dependencies and use ./node_modules/.bin/grunt
[17:06:00] <mikesherov> the first thing I did was http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/587/ which errored out while looking for "grunt.js" which means it was using global grunt 0.3
[17:06:16] <mikesherov> so I went onto jq03 and did npm uninstall grunt -g
[17:06:30] <Krinkle> ok
[17:06:54] <mikesherov> so I'm dumb
[17:07:09] <Krinkle> once logged in, go to jQuery Core/ and click " Build Now" (if you want to kick off a buld without making a commit)
[17:07:22] <Krinkle> but in this case you'll probably need to make another commit
[17:07:23] <Krinkle> hold on
[17:07:39] <mikesherov> I thought Jenkins downloaded the code first, then did npm install (which should theoretically install the local grunt as a dependency), and then running `grunt` should work
[17:07:42] <mikesherov> but it doesn't
[17:07:59] <Krinkle> yes, but no
[17:08:03] <Krinkle> it installs grunt yes
[17:08:12] <Krinkle> but 1) it doesn't install grunt-cli (that is a separate project as of 0.4)
[17:08:25] <Krinkle> 2) even if it would install that, it would be in node_modules/.bin, not in /usr/local/bin
[17:08:39] <Krinkle> npm install never touches your PATH neither does it default to global
[17:09:00] <Krinkle> mikesherov: so, in this case, commit to package.json adding grunt-cli
[17:09:00] <mikesherov> right, but I thought it didn't need grunt-cli if you had grunt itself in your package.json
[17:09:10] <mikesherov> I see
[17:09:15] <Krinkle> still need it :) default grunt is only usable with require('')
[17:09:23] <Krinkle> it is an npm module
[17:09:33] <Krinkle> as in, nothing more
[17:09:39] <mikesherov> right right
[17:09:41] <Krinkle> btw, while at it, also add it to scripts.test
[17:09:42] <mikesherov> that makes sense
[17:09:48] <mikesherov> thanks!
[17:10:00] <mikesherov> So I should do 2 things:
[17:10:09] <Krinkle> "scripts": { "test" : "./node_modules/.bin/grunt" }
[17:10:29] <Krinkle> and in devDependencies, add "grunt-cli": "latest"
[17:10:48] <mikesherov> 1. npm install -g grunt 0.3.17 on jq03 to get good old global grunt back for the projects we haven't upgraded
[17:10:56] <Krinkle> Right
[17:11:10] <mikesherov> and 2. do the devDependencies you mentioned
[17:11:22] <mikesherov> what does the : "scripts": { "test" : "./node_modules/.bin/grunt" } get us?
[17:11:42] <Krinkle> Makes "npm test" do "grunt"
[17:11:49] <Krinkle> which is nice and semantically right
[17:12:07] <Krinkle> we previously didnt do that because it wouldn't work out of the box anyway as grunt had to be global
[17:12:07] <mikesherov> oh, so that's just a bonus ;-)
[17:12:10] <Krinkle> but now that it isn't..
[17:12:12] <Krinkle> yeah
[17:12:16] <mikesherov> I see
[17:12:19] <mikesherov> thanks Krinkle!
[17:12:36] <Krinkle> and we can use some features in jenkins to use "npm test" so that we don't have to edit jenkins everytime we change the build command
[17:12:49] <Krinkle> but that's for later
[17:13:02] <Krinkle> I've went ahead and edited "JQuery Core" in jenkins to use './node_modules/.bin/grunt" instead of "grunt"
[17:13:55] <mikesherov> Krinkle: thanks
[17:18:28] <mikesherov> Krinkle: fingers crossed! Hopefully that works
[17:18:34] <mikesherov> thanks again for your help
