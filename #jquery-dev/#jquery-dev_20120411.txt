[05:27:02] <mikesherov> .
[05:28:11] <mikesherov> so, am I correct in saying it doesn't matter how many times .ready is actually fired on a page, because the actual queue is only run once?
[05:29:08] <mikesherov> for example, .ready is fired twice on most page loads already
[05:29:19] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: ^^^?
[05:29:34] <DaveMethvin> yup
[05:30:02] <mikesherov> cool, thanks

[10:14:15] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (1h, 10m ago): Remove object markup fixture; create programmatically; Supplements #10324
[10:14:20] <Krinkle> can you see whats going on?
[10:14:41] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: can you grant me edit permission in jquery/qunit issues?
[10:15:00] <Krinkle> I'd like to maybe organize some tickets like we do in testswarm
[10:26:56] <rwaldron> Krinkle, I can see them
[10:27:17] <Krinkle> https://a248.e.akamai.net/camo.github.com/5295323139a2c919d4f751e7dcc27737f6d0417e/687474703a2f2f6779617a6f2e636f6d2f37386462656663386439333537626639353438383439333532336237363933372e706e67
[10:27:20] <Krinkle> 404 Not Found
[10:27:37] <Krinkle> rwaldron: maybe do a fake edit and see if github reparse will fix it?
[10:27:44] <rwaldron> I'm loohttp://gyazo.com/4496e407c6900a5954602bd29cf6bf73
[10:27:46] <rwaldron> fffffffffffff
[10:27:46] <rwaldron> http://gyazo.com/4496e407c6900a5954602bd29cf6bf73
[10:28:27] <Krinkle> k
[10:29:46] <Krinkle> I'm not sure that fix is acceptable though, I mean.. if jQuery("param", "#object1") is doing that, I'd say there is more going on
[10:29:52] <Krinkle> we shouldn't cover it up by working around it
[10:30:02] <rwaldron> ugh
[10:30:33] <rwaldron> the problem was that the existing selector tests were too specific and expecting exactly 1 match
[10:30:46] <rwaldron> I shouldn't have added markup to the fixture
[10:30:56] <rwaldron> nothing more, nothing less
[10:31:26] <Krinkle> if `jQuery("param", "#object1")` is somehow matching a `<param>` outside #object1 ..
[10:31:54] <Krinkle> that's what's happening right?
[10:32:33] <rwaldron> But that has nothing to do with this issue
[10:32:37] <rwaldron> if that's the case
[10:32:46] <rwaldron> that would be a separate, Sizzle issue
[10:33:06] <Krinkle> rwaldron: Yes
[10:33:08] <Krinkle> that is the case
[10:33:17] <Krinkle> rwaldron: your commit added <object id="object2"><param name="test" value="test"></param></object>​
[10:33:27] <rwaldron> Right, I'm saying: Let's not conflate.
[10:33:28] <Krinkle> and it caused `jQuery("param", "#object1").length` to be higher
[10:33:47] <Krinkle> rwaldron: sure :)
[10:34:45] <rwaldron> yeah, that test is in Sizzle
[10:34:49] <rwaldron> so, file there
[10:37:09] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron Krinkle: I agree, the bug wasn't related to that patch ... also I am not sure why jQuery("param", "#object1") is tested since technically context can't be a string
[10:37:38] <DaveMethvin> i mean it works ... mostly ... except here, which seems to be an IE bug
[10:38:01] <Krinkle> afaik it just does $(context).find("param") and that is supported
[10:38:10] <DaveMethvin> right but jQuery("param", "#object1") is not
[10:38:26] <Krinkle> I'd bet the same bug happens when jQuery("#object1").find("param") is used
[10:38:35] <DaveMethvin> probably does :D
[10:38:52] <Krinkle> ahm.. where do I file this kind of bug?
[10:39:00] <Krinkle> jquery/sizzle on github?
[10:39:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:39:05] <Krinkle> ok
[10:44:37] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: rwaldron http://jsfiddle.net/C5PTY/
[10:45:21] <Krinkle> Testing http://jsfiddle.net/C5PTY/1/ in browserstack nw
[10:46:18] <Krinkle> http://jsfiddle.net/C5PTY/2/ (2: adds one with find() for DaveMethvin )
[10:46:42] <DaveMethvin> looks like a bug to me
[10:46:47] <Krinkle> yep
[10:46:55] <Krinkle> reproducible in IE7 and IE8
[10:47:06] <DaveMethvin> kinda have to wonder how IE gets to that
[10:47:16] <DaveMethvin> but i'll leave it to timmywil
[10:47:18] <DaveMethvin> :D
[10:47:26] <Krinkle> maybe it doesn't close the element properly ( /> vs </param>)
[10:47:39] <Krinkle> and then figures out some way to encapsulate 2 inside 1
[10:48:12] <Krinkle> if that is the case, then there is no way to fix it
[10:49:14] <DaveMethvin> whoops, i have angered ie7 and it has hung
[10:50:04] <timmywil> object tags can be very screwy in IE
[10:50:36] <DaveMethvin> oh sure, but ONLY object tags ... everything else works fine in IE ;-)
[10:52:00] <timmywil> we skip qsa completely for objects tags in IE8-9
[10:52:15] <Krinkle> qsa?
[10:52:17] <timmywil> sizzle should find params tho
[10:52:21] <Krinkle> (not query string append ?)
[10:52:22] <timmywil> querySelectorAll
[10:52:29] <Krinkle> right
[10:54:21] <Krinkle> timmywil: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/102
[10:54:21] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #102 on sizzle (Krinkle; 31.224s ago): find() matches a <param> outside the given `context`
[11:09:30] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: one question, does getElementsByTagName('*') include the param?
[11:09:56] <timmywil> that is a possible solution, but maybe not worth the code
[11:10:00] <DaveMethvin> I don't recall ... doesn't oldIE have a problem with "*"
[11:10:21] <DaveMethvin> that is,in general
[11:10:25] <timmywil> yea, it includes comments and sometimes text nodes
[11:10:30] <DaveMethvin> oh right
[11:11:06] <DaveMethvin> well it is a bug but doesnt seem to be a bug anyone but us has discovered
[11:11:17] <DaveMethvin> so i'd say it's low priority
[11:11:20] <timmywil> yerp
[11:12:55] <DaveMethvin> oh, and it turns out gEBTN("*") does NOT include the param timmywil
[11:13:03] <DaveMethvin> i'll note it on the ticket
[11:13:10] <timmywil> grr
[11:14:22] <DaveMethvin> scumbag gEBTN ... finds everything or finds nothing
[12:04:34] <jqcommit> [testswarm] Krinkle pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/CWPSaw

[12:05:04] <Krinkle-away> timmywil: DaveMethvin : Could my earlier hunch be correct?
[12:05:16] <Krinkle> that its not a param specific bug?
[12:05:41] <Krinkle> what happens if a non self-closing  is stated as if if it was self-closing?
[12:05:56] <DaveMethvin> i played with it a bit, seemed like it was specific to param
[12:05:58] <DaveMethvin> but who knows
[12:06:07] <Krinkle> e.g. if IE doesn't support a self-closing <param> (I recall something like that when working on a flash plugin once, that it has to be <param></param>)
[12:06:08] <DaveMethvin> it can't be that widespread or we would have gotten reports
[12:06:30] <Krinkle> in which case the <li> -like behavior applies
[12:06:42] <DaveMethvin> i think ie knows that params don't need closing tags tho
[12:06:50] <DaveMethvin> it just gets really confused
[12:07:05] <DaveMethvin> you can see that gEBTN("*") doesn't return param for example
[12:07:07] <DaveMethvin> but it should
[12:07:10] <DaveMethvin> if ie were sane
[12:07:14] <Krinkle> it sees <param>: ok; it sees another <param>, and implicitly closes it; it sees </object>: illegal, ignored, it sees <object>: accepted; it sees <param> and done
[12:07:28] <DaveMethvin> i tried moving the html around too, no change
[12:07:42] <Krinkle> so the tree ends up like <object 1> <param></param> <param></param> <object 2><param></param></object> </object>
[12:07:59] <Krinkle> maybe check firstChild stuff
[12:08:17] <DaveMethvin> i wrote out the names, no blank names there
[12:08:37] <Krinkle> can we at least determine whether the context is failing (i.e. it selects all param elements on the entire page?) or the parser is actually building a different dom.
[12:08:38] <DaveMethvin> it is really grabbing the "test" one out of object2 ... some how
[12:08:50] <Krinkle> yes
[12:09:17] <DaveMethvin> but in any case there is a ticket open, if you find out more you can post it there but it's not a high prio for me atm
[12:09:18] <Krinkle> Look at the sample above, it would make sense then if it considers object2 child of object1
[12:09:18] <Krinkle> maybe verify firstChild
[12:09:19] <Krinkle> children
[12:09:24] <Krinkle> k, np
[12:09:44] <Krinkle> I don't expect to encounter this in production either, but interesting nonetheless :)
