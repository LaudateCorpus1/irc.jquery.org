[04:16:17] <jaubourg> hi there
[04:18:17] <addyosmani> hola jaubourg
[04:38:36] <jaubourg> addy: I'll be in Boston in October
[04:38:52] <jaubourg> so I cannot be at fronteers
[04:39:48] <addyosmani> oh, of course.
[04:39:52] <addyosmani> thats alright jaubourg
[04:40:00] <addyosmani> too many confs in october. they're all overlapping :)
[04:54:41] <jaubourg> indeed
[04:58:38] <addyosmani> anyway..I have to eventually schedule in some time to drop by and say hi
[04:58:47] <addyosmani> haven't travelled too much around europe over the past few months
[04:59:13] <addyosmani> you're still RPG'ing, I assume? :)
[05:28:22] <jaubourg> yep I am
[05:28:32] <jaubourg> and yes, you should come
[05:28:43] <jaubourg> though I still need to buy a second bed or something
[05:29:14] <jaubourg> but you're welcome anytime my friend
[05:32:35] <addyosmani> lol. I'm sure I'd be fine on the couch
[05:32:59] <addyosmani> but thanks :) I'll see if I can something setup in the next few months!
[05:33:16] <addyosmani> time for lunch. brbs
[05:34:29] <jaubourg> :)
[06:05:56] <rgap64> good afternoon/morning/evening, would it be possible to find a list of the people responsible for the core development of jQuery (i.e those who actually contribute code to the project)
[06:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> rgap64: you can run `git log --pretty="%an" | sort | uniq` against the repo to find all contributors, but I don't think that's what your'e looking for
[06:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> you can use %cn to get all committers
[06:40:39] <scott_gonzalez> which will be close to what you want
[06:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> the current committers are dmethvin, jaubourg, jeresig, jitter, timmywil, wycats
[06:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> though wycats isn't active
[06:43:48] <rgap64> thanks scott_gonzalez :)
[06:44:08] <rgap64> i am doing an analysis of jQuery v some idiots own library for a client
[06:44:26] <scott_gonzalez> rwldrn is active too, though he's not on the he's not on the core team
[06:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> he's on the bugs team
[06:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> that list is ajpiano, cowboy, danheberden, gf3, louisremi, rdworth, rwldrn, scottgonzalez, timmywil
[06:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> but the bugs team doesn't have commit access
[06:46:50] <rgap64> it's more the number of people involved, i am proposing to a major corporate to use jquery instead of a proprietory library (a distilled version of jquery) which has no docs, and is developed by a single contractor within the organisation :)
[06:47:07] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[06:47:25] <scott_gonzalez> do you want the the total number of people who have contributed?
[06:47:26] <gf3> that number will be massive
[06:47:36] <gf3> if you consider all the people who report issues on the bug tracker
[06:47:42] <gf3> and all the forum posts
[06:47:45] <gf3> &c...
[06:47:53] <timmywil> rgap64: that would be enough of an argument right there: no docs
[06:47:58] <timmywil> for me that is
[06:48:05] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, all code contributors is easy to get, all contributors is pretty tough
[06:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> this is interesting: # of commits by committer: http://typewith.me/zAy7VcXwI4
[06:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> stats are a little funky because of the svn --> git change
[06:51:27] <scott_gonzalez> some people are listed twice
[06:51:38] <scott_gonzalez> like John Resig + jeresig
[06:52:22] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: rgap64: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/77245/git-rank-contributors is really nice.
[06:52:28] <kswedberg> ## git-rank-contributors: a simple script to trace through the logs and
[06:52:28] <kswedberg> ## rank contributors by the total size of the diffs they're responsible for.
[06:52:28] <kswedberg> ## A change counts twice as much as a plain addition or deletion.
[07:05:49] <rgap64> thanks very much indeed for your help all
[07:45:42] <timmywil> man chrome needs a lion update
[07:45:47] <timmywil> bad
[07:59:12] <danheberden> timmywil http://twitter.com/#!/danheberden/statuses/94053129078833153
[07:59:13] <socialhapy> http://bit.ly/oLL8gX @danheberden: setting `swipe between pages` to two/three fingers and `swipe between full-screen apps` to swipe w/ 4 fingers has made #lion useable
[07:59:57] <timmywil> danheberden: yea I did that as well. Chrome is significantly slower for me tho.
[08:00:21] <danheberden> timmywil oh you want _performance_ too? no, you only get cool swipy things or performance
[08:00:22] <danheberden> :p
[08:00:31] <timmywil> lol
[08:00:48] <timmywil> paul_irish_: make speedy
[08:00:56] <danheberden> twss
[08:01:16] <timmywil> hehe
[08:39:52] <jaubourg> re
[09:14:24] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: I added a sentence about colors to the .css page before seeing your comment.
[09:14:54] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: eh, ok :)
[09:15:30] <DaveMethvin> in general i agree on some of these things though, the docs get kind of cluttered with "don't do this thing you shouldn't be doing anyway"
[09:15:50] <DaveMethvin> none of of this stuff is black and white
[09:15:59] <DaveMethvin> whoops i mean #000 and #fff
[09:16:37] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: yeah, that's the tricky thing with needsdocs tags on issues, too. it's easy to say needsdocs, but it's hard to finesse the docs without overwhelming
[09:17:00] <DaveMethvin> especially when ppl expect jQuery to insulate them from every bump in the road
[09:17:08] <kswedberg> yep
[09:17:53] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg timmywil, what do you guys think about some kind of jquery dev blog where we could cover some of these things outside the api pages?
[09:18:07] <DaveMethvin> they come up over and over
[09:18:17] <timmywil> yea that could be cool
[09:18:23] <DaveMethvin> we could all contribute
[09:18:26] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: that's partly what the learn.jquery.com site is about
[09:18:36] <kswedberg> just need to get it up.
[09:18:38] <DaveMethvin> we can use that vehicle if it's appropriate
[09:18:39] <kswedberg> TWSS
[09:18:43] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:18:46] <timmywil> hehe
[09:19:01] <timmywil> alright, gotta run to a lunch mtg, bbl
[09:19:07] <DaveMethvin> slater
[09:19:18] <kswedberg> timmywil: btw, http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#How_do_I_check.2Funcheck_a_checkbox_input_or_radio_button.3F
[09:19:22] <kswedberg> needs an update. ;)
[09:19:26] <kswedberg> but go eat lunch first!
[09:19:31] <phishbot> hi guys!
[09:19:46] <DaveMethvin> sup phishbot
[09:19:54] <phishbot> i feel like an outsider in here
[09:20:00] <kswedberg> phishbot: ?
[09:20:01] <kswedberg> why?
[09:21:06] <kswedberg> do you feel like a phish out of water?
[09:21:07] <phishbot> i haven't committed anything to the jquery project
[09:21:09] <phishbot> lol
[09:21:11] <phishbot> :P
[09:21:24] <DaveMethvin> there are lotsa ways to help
[09:21:34] <kswedberg> :) what DaveMethvin said ^
[09:21:36] <DaveMethvin> like,  you can  head over the forum and answer questions
[09:21:38] <phishbot> i've tried to do bug triage
[09:22:07] <DaveMethvin> the trick with bug triage is to get to know the old tickets, and yeah it takes a while
[09:22:18] <DaveMethvin> about 3/4 of all new tickets are really dups
[09:22:21] <phishbot> ah i see
[09:22:44] <DaveMethvin> well, once you pull out the invalid ones i guess
[09:22:59] <DaveMethvin> too many ppl posting the "my code doesn't work" ticket
[09:23:03] <phishbot> yeah
[09:23:19] <DaveMethvin> that's why we close em after two weeks if they can't give a test case
[09:23:31] <phishbot> ah
[09:23:41] <DaveMethvin> well trac-o-bot closes them
[09:23:53] <DaveMethvin> that way we can be passive aggressive
[09:24:04] <DaveMethvin> "oh no it wasn't us, it was the bot"
[09:24:22] <phishbot> lol
[09:24:38] <DaveMethvin> but really, feel free to hang out in the forum and i bet you can answer questions there
[09:24:55] <DaveMethvin> if it keeps them from opening bug tix we'd be eternally grateful!
[09:24:58] <phishbot> okay, thanks Dave :)
[12:34:37] <rwaldron> psst
[12:35:21] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron did you just psst yourself?
[12:35:43] <rwaldron> hahahaha
