[07:39:21] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish miketaylr http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14415 we'd love some input on how to fix this, short of removing support
[07:45:37] <m_gol> the url doesn't load for me...
[07:45:52] <m_gol> ok, it loaded after a minute :D
[07:45:59] <DaveMethvin> damn trac
[07:46:20] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, what about what I wrote in reply to your post?
[07:46:34] <DaveMethvin> did i miss your comment?
[07:46:52] <DaveMethvin> oh  yeah i did
[07:46:55] <m_gol> :)
[07:46:57] <DaveMethvin> sorry!
[07:47:01] <DaveMethvin> can you add that to the ticket?
[07:47:21] <DaveMethvin> assuming you can get trac to cooperate
[07:48:54] <m_gol> sure
[07:51:43] <m_gol> DaveMetvin: I added the comment
[07:51:54] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[07:52:30] <m_gol> it would be soooo good if spec authors went for that approach
[07:52:36] <m_gol> :dreaming:
[07:52:49] <DaveMethvin> i am sure they have their reasons for not doing it that way
[07:52:58] <DaveMethvin> not necessarily GOOD reasons :)
[07:53:17] <DaveMethvin> we just need to start this discussion and get a usable sourcemap behavior
[07:53:23] <m_gol> one of the reasons might be: "I moved all 3 files to my site and source maps don't work on them!"
[07:53:40] <DaveMethvin> so many ways to break this at the moment
[07:53:41] <m_gol> but I'd prefer to screw web devs in this way rather than throwing 404s at them
[07:54:17] <m_gol> anyway, this all is still new, once more libraries adopt source maps, a dev could stumble upon massive amount of 404s just because they copied minified files only
[07:54:26] <DaveMethvin> clearly at least 341 people are confused http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18365315/jquerys-jquery-1-10-2-min-map-is-triggering-a-404-not-found
[07:54:50] <m_gol> yeah
[07:55:12] <m_gol> "Fix: get the files" -> "Fix: get the proper files because different CDNs use different formats"
[07:55:38] <m_gol> "omg why are there 3 versions of jquery-1.10.2"
[07:55:49] <DaveMethvin> exactly
[07:56:12] <DaveMethvin> and DON'T RENAME ANYTHING
[08:04:17] <miketaylr> thanks DaveMethvin, will forward that to the right guys
[08:08:51] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I forwarded a mail Nick wrote to me instead to the whole group (by mistake?) to our dev list
[08:16:59] <miketaylr> m_gol: is your dev list public?
[08:18:09] <m_gol> miketaylr: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jquery-devs-team/COdo73ZPk78
[08:18:22] <miketaylr> m_gol: thanks!
[08:18:29] <m_gol> anyway, that would solve SOME of our issues but not all (see my comment under jQuery bug linked by DaveMethvin)
[08:18:30] <miketaylr> ah, You must be signed in and a member of this group to view and participate in it.
[08:18:42] <miketaylr> THANKS OBAMA
[08:18:50] <DaveMethvin> let's discuss on the ticket, that's why i opened it
[08:19:02] <DaveMethvin> or if that's a prob we can find another place
[08:19:26] <m_gol> anyway, Nick proposed more officialy what we were discussing some time ago, i.e. the "//# implicitSourceMap" version of the pragma
[08:19:51] <m_gol> though that wouldn't solve all the issues, e.g. getbootstrap.com would still generate 404s
[08:42:38] <miketaylr> DaveMethvin: ok, sent an email to the devtools list and encouraged people to discuss things in trac
[08:43:01] <m_gol> great, thanks!
[10:06:20] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Color build #109: SUCCESS in 1 min 13 sec: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Color/109/
[10:06:21] <doesallmagic2> * Timo Tijhof: Gruntfile: Remove project prefix from TestSwarm job name
[10:06:21] <doesallmagic2> * Timo Tijhof: readme: Update build status badge to jenkins.jquery.com
[10:49:21] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: curious - how was the experience of https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/commit/df96b831eea25788f2a0df3852369c0210782bc0 ?
[10:49:22] <b-ot> gnarf: Dave Methvin (1w 5d ago): jQuery core 2.1.0-beta1 and 1.11.0-beta1
[10:49:32] <gnarf> did things work mostly as expected?
[10:49:37] <gnarf> easy to push to cdn?
[12:44:23] <DaveMethvin> gnarf it wasn't too hard to figure out, so yeah I'd say it was a success
[12:44:34] <DaveMethvin> the cdn that is
[13:53:09] <paul_irish> m_gol: DaveMethvin: some good news.
[13:53:18] <paul_irish> a new Chrome version is shipping today/tomorrow
[13:53:26] <paul_irish> and it does not have those 404s anymore
[13:53:31] <paul_irish> we fast tracked it
[14:03:00] <m_gol> paul_irish: great!
