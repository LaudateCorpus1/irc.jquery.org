[04:51:06] <Dr4g> How does one stop jquery mobile include from attaching its 'mobile' process onto <a> tags on the page? I was only looking to use it for its 'orientationchange' event
[04:54:10] <Dr4g> I fixed it, found some config options and added this:
[04:54:11] <Dr4g> $.extend(  $.mobile , { linkBindingEnabled: false });
[07:59:44] <gibson042> .
[13:39:36] <Krinkle> I'm so happy I never have to do this anymore with BrowserStack:
