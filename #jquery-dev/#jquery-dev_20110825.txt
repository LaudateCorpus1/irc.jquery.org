[11:01:21] <DaveMethvin> timmywil, rwaldron: Anything other than these that need to get into 1.6.3?  http://bugs.jquery.com/query?milestone=^1.6&status=!closed&order=priority
[11:01:39] <DaveMethvin> maybe we should tackle the .data() fixes in 1.7?
[11:01:45] <rwaldron> looking
[11:01:49] <rwaldron> sure
[11:02:00] <rwaldron> thats become a harder nut to crack then i thought
[11:02:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah not surprisingly
[11:02:19] <DaveMethvin> and we need to get 1.6.3 out to clear the decks for 1.7
[11:02:20] <rwaldron> To be honest, the issue I'm having is that I disagree
[11:02:26] * rwaldron shrugs
[11:02:30] <rwaldron> but its not about me
[11:02:38] <DaveMethvin> disagree with what?
[11:02:42] <rwaldron> it's about what is best for the lib
[11:03:05] <rwaldron> I disagree that we should only read data-* once
[11:03:12] <rwaldron> as some kind of declarative thing
[11:03:23] <DaveMethvin> well the only other consistent thing is to always keep it in sync, would you agree?
[11:03:52] <rwaldron> which i also dont think is a good idea
[11:03:58] <rwaldron> i need to get over it really
[11:04:01] <rwaldron> so yeah
[11:04:02] <rwaldron> 1.7
[11:04:14] <DaveMethvin> well if you feel bad because .data() is all screwed up then join the crowd
[11:04:42] <rwaldron> hahahah
[11:04:44] <DaveMethvin> but i just can't see any way out that lets us resolve backcompat and an intuitive relationship with html5 data- attrs
[11:05:03] <DaveMethvin> we have the same problem with .removeData("abc def otherProp")
[11:05:15] <rwaldron> yeah
[11:05:15] <DaveMethvin> there was never a rule that data strings couldn't have a space
[11:05:39] <DaveMethvin> hell, it can be .data("abc\x04-def", true)
[11:07:12] <DaveMethvin> ok, so it sounds like a better idea to wait until 1.7 for that since we will be changing rules
[11:08:05] <DaveMethvin> most of the stuff on that list has a pull, except docs#10067 and docs#9699
[11:08:26] <DaveMethvin> damn lazy bot
[11:15:37] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: what are your thoughts on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10067 going into 1.6.3? Changes to .ready() make me queasy since they can be tough to test
[11:15:55] <DaveMethvin> has that been broken all along?
[11:34:17] <rwaldron> looking
[11:34:24] <rwaldron> (sorry was in a quick meeting)
[11:34:45] <rwaldron> Oh right... I actually consulted jdalton about that
[11:35:00] <rwaldron> he has a knack for those things
[11:35:18] <rwaldron> Basically, his advice echo'ed my original stance
[11:35:30] <rwaldron> DOMContentLoaded exists for a reason
[11:35:37] <rwaldron> no need to mess with it
[11:35:47] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^^
[11:36:26] <DaveMethvin> so we're not missing .ready?
[11:36:47] <rwaldron> the "use case" is absurd
[11:37:01] <DaveMethvin> you mean the never-ending iframe?
[11:37:26] <rwaldron> "a lot of Ctrl+F5"
[11:38:34] <DaveMethvin> checking the test case there
[11:40:23] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin the lik i gave is easier to understand
[11:40:24] <rwaldron> http://jsfiddle.net/rwaldron/cUqWc/
[11:40:52] <DaveMethvin> right, i saw that but no jQuery
[11:40:57] <DaveMethvin> so what is the jquery thing?
[11:41:07] <rwaldron> first inconsistency: http://gyazo.com/bd522b7920ff812688e2ce6ca400876a
[11:41:10] <DaveMethvin> his example loads jquery after the doc is loaded
[11:41:35] <rwaldron> indeed it does
[11:41:53] <rwaldron> my example is showing what states occur
[11:41:56] <DaveMethvin> you're saying for that shot, there is no complete
[11:42:10] <rwaldron> as you can see, we already have a case, in Opera, where interactive doesnt happen
[11:42:27] <rwaldron> the changes are piling up
[11:42:30] <DaveMethvin> ok well i'm gonna push it to 1.7 at least
[11:42:37] <DaveMethvin> b/c it's not a 1.6.3 thing at this point
[11:44:09] <timmywil> hi there
[11:44:25] <rwaldron> hey timmywil
[11:44:53] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[11:44:56] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin looking at this list
[11:44:59] <rwaldron> i think that's everything
[11:45:18] <DaveMethvin> all but #9699 that's timmywil's call
[11:45:22] <rwaldron> timmywil docs#9699
[11:45:36] <rwaldron> as soon as that's sorted we can test for 1.6.3
[11:45:46] <DaveMethvin> we need to land everything
[11:45:51] <rwaldron> that too
[11:45:58] <DaveMethvin> there is one patch for the "crushes" prob with inarray that needs some tweaking
[11:46:02] <rwaldron> 1.6.2 went out without being confirmed btw
[11:46:12] <DaveMethvin> and we need to run testswarm on it all
[11:46:20] <DaveMethvin> anybody done that before?
[11:46:25] <DaveMethvin> not me :)
[11:46:27] <rwaldron> no i havent
[11:46:37] <DaveMethvin> timmywil is our only hope
[11:46:37] <rwaldron> i just run in every browser that we support
[11:46:51] <rwaldron> help us timmywil, you're our only hope.
[11:46:53] <DaveMethvin> i can work on the release notes tonight
[11:47:00] <rwaldron> cool
[11:47:20] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin what needs to be tweaked?
[11:47:20] <timmywil> John has just had me run the full suite in every browser
[11:47:23] <DaveMethvin> maybe do a rc tomorrow and then final on monday if nobody has any probs
[11:47:23] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/465/files
[11:47:24] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by anton-ryzhov (1w, 1d ago): $.inArray crushes IE6 and Chrome if second argument is `null` or `undefined`
[11:47:32] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin: +1
[11:48:02] <DaveMethvin> ok we can all have a browserfest
[11:48:40] <DaveMethvin> i was getting some strange probs on master using Chrome a coupla days ago, gotta go back and see if those were self-inflicted
[11:49:23] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: maybe all those got fixed in pull 465, i'll have to check
[11:49:34] <rwaldron> i think they dide
[11:49:37] <rwaldron> did*
[11:49:41] <rwaldron> looks good from ehre
[11:49:42] <rwaldron> here*
[11:50:15] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin one thing I've encountered alot lately
[11:50:27] <rwaldron> is chrome extension goggles
[11:50:48] <rwaldron> viewing the tests through chrome with any extensions enabled is asking for a headache
[11:50:57] <DaveMethvin> i don't have that one, but that's a good point ... incognito mode might help
[11:51:08] <rwaldron> ohhh good call
[11:51:11] <rwaldron> i never thought of that
[11:51:15] <rwaldron> i just disable them
[11:51:18] <rwaldron> and them enable
[11:51:20] <rwaldron> manually
[11:51:41] <rwaldron> b/c "measureit" and "window resizer" are basically a bunch of jerks
[11:51:47] <rwaldron> they run "in page" or whatever
[11:51:52] <rwaldron> and add shit to the DOM
[11:52:48] <DaveMethvin> this one still fails in incognito: selector: pseudo - position (1, 24, 25)
[11:53:18] <DaveMethvin> oh but im not on master, lemme switch
[11:54:28] <DaveMethvin> hmm, even worse ... browser detect change from webkit to chrome is failing???

[12:46:42] <timmywil> DaveMethvin
[12:52:29] <DaveMethvin> timmywil:
[12:52:40] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[12:52:57] <DaveMethvin> so i will do a draft of the blog post tonight
[12:52:59] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you have anything else?
[12:53:05] <DaveMethvin> i think that's it]
[12:53:09] <timmywil> cool
[12:53:12] <DaveMethvin> unless someone had a patch they really wanted
[12:53:26] <DaveMethvin> the rest of the queue looks like it doesn't belong
[12:53:37] <timmywil> I'm good here
[12:53:58] <DaveMethvin> wheee!
[12:54:06] <timmywil> wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
[14:47:36] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin FWIW, merging in chronological order FTW.
[14:47:39] <rwaldron> :P
[14:48:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah, now that you mention it ..
[14:48:25] <DaveMethvin> also we should merge patches asap i guess
[14:48:33] <rwaldron> agreed
[14:48:44] <rwaldron> at least as soon as they are reviewed, vetted, etc.
[14:48:50] <DaveMethvin> right
[14:49:01] <rwaldron> i have a replacement for 9453 coming up in a moment
[14:49:10] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[14:49:13] <rwaldron> no problem!
[14:53:15] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin all set broseph
[14:53:26] <rwaldron> my new favorite thing...
[14:53:52] <rwaldron> when i have a pull request that needs fixin'... git push origin :branchname && git push origin -u branchname
[14:54:11] <rwaldron> deletes the remote and pushes the new same named branch
[14:54:20] <rwaldron> github is smart enough to swap em out
[18:08:45] <jdevel> I'm relatively new to jquery but not javascript.  I'm working on creating a quick plugin and was wondering what the best way to get to access the element(s)?  When I use this, it's referring to the jQuery object.  I can access the element by using the zero index such as this[0] and I get my element.  Is this the best way to access it?
[18:10:15] <jdevel> I was thinking perhaps a function like getBoundElement or something to that effect.  I do understand that a collection of elements are returned based on the selector used in the jQuery call.
[18:17:10] <DaveMethvin> jdevel: try the #jquery channel, or http://forum.jquery.com, there is a "Writing jQuery Plugins" group there
[18:17:24] <jdevel> Thank you for your feedback
[18:17:33] <DaveMethvin> but in general, the "this" in a plugin is the collection which looks pretty array-like
[18:17:49] <jdevel> no actually this is the jQuery object
[18:18:02] <jdevel> wait
[18:18:03] <jdevel> sorry
[18:18:09] <jdevel> my mistake
[18:18:23] <jdevel> indeed you are right
[18:18:44] <jdevel> hence this[0] providing the first item in the collection
[18:19:35] <jdevel> since it was type object, I thought perhaps it was the jquery object, but its just an array
[18:20:37] <DaveMethvin> right, at least it looks array like but it's not an Array
[18:20:45] <DaveMethvin> so it doesn't have Array methods like .concat
[18:22:47] <jdevel> thank you for clearing that up for me
[18:23:18] <jdevel> a while back I was using $ as a shortcut for document.getElementById()
[18:23:26] <jdevel> however jquery took it to another leve
[18:23:29] <jdevel> level
[19:09:05] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: I WANT MY HTTPS!
[19:09:22] <rwaldron> say what>
[19:09:23] <rwaldron> ?
[19:09:49] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10142
[19:09:50] <rwaldron> oh hahahahahahaha
[19:09:59] <rwaldron> BEST REPLY EVER
[19:10:02] <DaveMethvin> RAMIREZ! GET THAT MAN A SECURE CONNECTION!
[19:10:32] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea whether it ever worked with https ... did it?
[19:10:33] <rwaldron> that trumps my personal best
[19:10:41] <rwaldron> which was when some dude filed about iOS
[19:10:52] <rwaldron> and told him to send me his device to test on
[19:10:59] <rwaldron> and i'd send it back when i was done
[19:11:06] <DaveMethvin> lol, yeah sure you will
[19:11:25] <DaveMethvin> "But if jQuery are providing a CDN for web developers to use, then it has to work all of the time, no matter what the protocol." oh god
[19:11:47] <DaveMethvin> ok, back to the release notes
[19:13:02] <rwaldron> this is one of thse... resolve as "shut up" moments
[19:16:17] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin here... http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6499#comment:2
[19:16:25] <rwaldron> not iOS it was PS3
[19:16:27] <rwaldron> hahaha
[19:16:56] <DaveMethvin> lol even better
[19:17:29] <rwaldron> jQuery doesnt work on my WebTV
[19:17:33] <rwaldron> booooo hooooo
[22:56:26] <addyosmani> bot-t: tell danheberden needs some spamz removed from the plugin site (even though we're nuking it later). do you know the best pers. to speak to?
[22:56:26] <bot-t> addyosmani, Okay.
