[01:46:17] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: btw, tracked it down and received today a copy of the hoodie (without jQuery logo that is) ‚Äì http://www.alternativeapparel.com/basic-eco-jersey-zip-hoodie-01970e1 "Basic Eco-Jersey Zip Hoodie", Alternate Apparel, Eco True Navy color.
[01:46:43] <Krinkle> The main thing I was after is the nice material overall fitting and textured color.
[01:46:51] <Krinkle> Ordered it last week, received two of them today.
[01:46:54] <Krinkle> So I'm good for now :)
[01:47:42] <Krinkle> It's the most favourite piece of clothing I own (the jQuery one) and just had to have another one of it in case I lose it and for when it's in the laundry :D
[10:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: nice :-)

[13:35:04] <ryanneufeld> I have a quick question for you guys. Is there any place that jquery would set the the Connection header for an ajax request?
[13:35:12] <ryanneufeld> I'm seeing an error in the console "Refused to set unsafe header "Connection" "
[13:35:47] <ryanneufeld> when i check the back trace I can't see any code setting it, but it obviously traces back to the xhr (jquery 1.8.0)
[13:37:13] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: yt?
[13:37:32] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: yep
[13:37:46] <ryanneufeld> am I chasing the wrong tail on this?
[13:38:15] <DaveMethvin> you mean like Connection: keep-alive?
[13:38:22] <DaveMethvin> does XHR even let you set that?
[13:38:32] <DaveMethvin> i think that's what it's saying
[13:38:53] <ryanneufeld> I'm not even sure what it's trying to set it to
[13:39:46] <DaveMethvin> can you set a bp on the point where the error fires?
[13:39:53] <ryanneufeld> ugh
[13:39:55] <ryanneufeld> it's mootools
[13:40:00] <ryanneufeld> fuu
[13:40:04] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[13:40:15] <DaveMethvin> where did you find this web page, 2006?
[13:40:20] <ryanneufeld> haha
[13:40:26] <ryanneufeld> it's our old dashboard
[13:40:29] <ryanneufeld> for opendns.com
[13:40:57] <DaveMethvin> oh one of those great pages where they combo 3 or 4 libs that all conflict
[13:41:03] <ryanneufeld> ugh
[13:41:04] <ryanneufeld> tyeah
[13:41:12] <ryanneufeld> I've been pointing out the folley of that
[13:41:23] <ryanneufeld> there is a lot of startup code in there
[13:41:30] <ryanneufeld> our new dashboard is all backbone/reacty
[13:41:39] <ryanneufeld> we're planning on killing this one with fire
[13:41:48] <ryanneufeld> thanks for being a rubber ducky!
[13:41:53] <DaveMethvin> so why you tryna fix this one?
[13:42:53] <ryanneufeld> coworker found it in the js console while debugging a prodution outage
[13:43:01] <DaveMethvin> ah
[13:43:11] <ryanneufeld> so once we fixed the big problem, we chose to try and clean that up too
[13:43:18] <DaveMethvin> sounds like a red herring, i suspect it's been there a while
[13:43:20] <ryanneufeld> clean tech debt while we're at it
[13:43:22] <ryanneufeld> it has been
[13:44:14] <ryanneufeld> This code is from 2011
