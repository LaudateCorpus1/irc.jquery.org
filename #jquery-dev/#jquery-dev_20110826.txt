[06:40:20] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[06:40:37] <DaveMethvin> yep rwaldron
[06:40:44] <rwaldron> good morning
[06:41:02] <DaveMethvin> good morning!

[06:41:12] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (13m, 25s ago): Fix lint complaints about unescaped -. Follow up to #10021
[06:41:12] <rwaldron> :)
[06:41:33] <rwaldron> thats the only issue so far
[06:41:47] <DaveMethvin> lint is stupid! how come my lint didn't complain?
[06:41:51] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[06:42:00] <rwaldron> hahaha
[06:42:16] <rwaldron> also, wasn't sure if you were going to get this one in as well...

[06:42:17] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by rwldrn (2m, 4w ago): jQuery.inArray() support for fromIndex(opt) arg; Fixes #9453
[06:42:18] <DaveMethvin> well crap it did
[06:42:21] <DaveMethvin> but it's wrong
[06:42:28] <rwaldron> wrong?
[06:42:31] <DaveMethvin> you don't need to escape a dash at the beginning of a char class
[06:42:41] <DaveMethvin> since it's clear it's not a range
[06:42:46] <rwaldron> i didn't think so
[06:42:46] <timmywil> rwaldron: nono, that's for 1.7
[06:42:52] <rwaldron> timmywil ++
[06:43:12] <DaveMethvin> i was talking about 476
[06:43:17] <rwaldron> yep
[06:43:18] <rwaldron> me too
[06:43:31] <rwaldron> i side tracked, sorry
[06:43:34] <timmywil> yea i know, i just saw 398
[06:43:36] <rwaldron> back to 476
[06:43:55] <timmywil> i'm ok with escaping to make lint be quiet
[06:44:04] <rwaldron> same here
[06:44:05] <timmywil> but I want to back out chrome detection
[06:44:11] <rwaldron> +1
[06:44:14] <DaveMethvin> i'm good with that too
[06:44:15] <rwaldron> (i guess?)
[06:44:25] <rwaldron> i don't think it's a big deal to be honest
[06:44:26] <DaveMethvin> it's a trivial thing but chrome detection is a feature
[06:44:32] <DaveMethvin> and a begrudging feature at that :P
[06:44:34] <rwaldron> we can really just not tell anyone its there
[06:44:41] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: what was the issue that popped up with it?
[06:44:49] <rwaldron> which i thought was the case anyway
[06:45:04] <DaveMethvin> the user agent string is Chrome but the match is for chrome (no caps)
[06:45:08] <DaveMethvin> and the regexp doesnt have /i
[06:45:13] <rwaldron> hm
[06:45:16] <DaveMethvin> dunno if they changed the caps or not
[06:45:17] <timmywil> ah
[06:45:34] <timmywil> well, that's easy
[06:45:44] <timmywil> but yea. Is this a feature or a bug fix?
[06:45:58] <rwaldron> wait a sec...
[06:45:58] <DaveMethvin> i'm ok with calling it a feature and pushing to 1.7
[06:46:16] <timmywil> cause if it's a bug fix, safari still can't be detected.  If it's a feature, I'd say wait til 1.7
[06:46:22] <rwaldron> so, this has been in here since june
[06:46:27] <rwaldron> it's already been released
[06:46:32] <timmywil> oh haha
[06:46:34] <timmywil> well then
[06:46:42] <timmywil> tooooo late
[06:46:48] <DaveMethvin> it's a little deceptive, i landed it in early August
[06:46:51] <rwaldron> and those tests pass

[06:46:53] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by rwldrn (2m, 6d ago): Begrudgingly adds chrome detection to jQuery.browser (1.7). Fixes #9385
[06:47:19] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, it was failing for me, but let me check again
[06:47:32] <timmywil> well, ignoring case is a good idea anyway
[06:47:38] <rwaldron> true true
[06:47:44] <DaveMethvin> maybe it lowercases the whole browser string??
[06:47:51] <rwaldron> so none of the others ignore case
[06:47:57] <rwaldron> it does
[06:48:07] <rwaldron> elsewhere
[06:48:16] <rwaldron> because none of the regex's are /i
[06:48:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:48:29] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/dd93d0eb32dc638ff3319792a885acd6d3c25c30/src/core.js#L831
[06:48:31] <DaveMethvin> so why was it failing for me??
[06:48:46] <rwaldron> because you don't escape dashes
[06:48:48] <rwaldron> jerk.
[06:48:52] <timmywil> lol
[06:48:54] <rwaldron> :D
[06:48:58] <DaveMethvin> lol
[06:49:02] <rwaldron> crockford is coming for you
[06:49:07] <rwaldron> look barbara!
[06:49:11] <rwaldron> there he is now!
[06:49:16] <DaveMethvin> i can't type if i'm laughing
[06:49:21] <DaveMethvin> so you are slowing me down
[06:49:22] <rwaldron> (conf beer for anyone that gets that)
[06:49:24] <aaronmcadam> lol
[06:49:48] <rwaldron> (even though i kinda botched it - just makes it a little harder)
[06:50:20] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin so, i was looking at _really_ old jQuery source
[06:50:47] <rwaldron> and realized that if docco existed in '06-'07, jQuery docs would be a breeeze
[06:51:10] <DaveMethvin> btw the browser test does pass, dunno why it failed before
[06:51:35] * rwaldron shrugs
[06:51:38] <rwaldron> so...
[06:51:43] <rwaldron> here's one thing i remember
[06:52:08] <rwaldron> when i ran those tests, i had a hell of time getting Chrome to forget about the file it loads in
[06:52:12] <rwaldron> with all of the sample UAs
[06:52:18] <DaveMethvin> oh, that might be it
[06:52:30] <rwaldron> at one point i had to add a cache bust to is
[06:52:31] <rwaldron> it*
[06:52:38] <rwaldron> just to test and not want to kill someone
[06:52:48] <rwaldron> the source and tests updated
[06:53:09] <rwaldron> but Chrome simply refused to look for a newer version of that file
[06:53:14] <DaveMethvin> and then the random failures i get from not running incognito from the plugin interference ... oy
[06:53:21] <rwaldron> and i think i know why...
[06:53:38] <rwaldron> "webkit".length === "chrome".length
[06:53:40] <timmywil> drumroll
[06:53:41] <timmywil> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9385#comment:16
[06:53:45] <rwaldron> do file length never changed
[06:53:49] <timmywil> toldyaso
[06:54:22] <rwaldron> do?
[06:54:32] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i am feeling stabby today
[06:54:36] <DaveMethvin> he better watch out
[06:54:44] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin FOR REAL
[06:54:48] <DaveMethvin> ok so i tried backing that out in my local git and it won't
[06:54:58] <rwaldron> yeah, so...
[06:55:01] <DaveMethvin> i landed it using the github button
[06:55:04] <DaveMethvin> maybe a mistake
[06:55:11] <rwaldron> i don't think its a big deaaaal
[06:55:17] <rwaldron> seriously
[06:55:25] <rwaldron> let's just NEVER tell anyone about it
[06:55:40] <DaveMethvin> it is a change tho, webkit is gone and chrome is there
[06:55:54] <DaveMethvin> so you know someone uses the webkit name
[06:55:57] <rwaldron> Krinkle dude...
[06:56:00] <rwaldron> seriously?
[06:56:06] <Krinkle> what ?
[06:56:09] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: webkit isn't gone
[06:56:16] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin webkit is there
[06:56:25] <DaveMethvin> oh i thought it left
[06:56:31] <rwaldron> nope
[06:56:36] <timmywil> just two webkit tests
[06:56:40] <rwaldron> right
[06:57:01] <rwaldron> Krinkle webkit will still match safari
[06:57:07] <DaveMethvin> ok so, are we keeping it in 1.6.3? like i said i couldn't back it out easily
[06:57:07] <rwaldron> but seriously...
[06:57:12] <rwaldron> dont use $.browser
[06:57:14] <rwaldron> <3
[06:57:27] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I think that's fine
[06:57:30] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: i suppose if it was in 1.6.2
[06:57:48] <timmywil> but grrrrr
[06:57:55] <Krinkle> rwaldron: I'm not using it, at all. I just care a bit about the naming and such and it seems wrong. 'webkit' matches basically every user agent that is not Chrome and contains "WebKit" which is not just Safari.
[06:58:14] <timmywil> Krinkle: it also matches chrome
[06:58:32] <timmywil> but i made the same point months ago
[06:58:46] <DaveMethvin> i would prefer to let people do their own regexpy matches on that crap so jQuery isn't so fragile
[06:58:59] <rwaldron> Krinkle fact: None of us even wanted to add it in the first place
[06:59:19] <rwaldron> Fact: I'd rather just remove $.browser and offer it as a back compat plugin
[06:59:27] <rwaldron> there i said it.
[06:59:33] <DaveMethvin> and rwaldron we don't have to add it in 1.6.3 if you don't want, sounds like timmywil wanted to leave it out entirely and technically it WAS voted down
[06:59:34] <Krinkle> timmywil: Yes the regex matches Chrome, but since it's chrome || webkit || .. webkit doesn't match chrome
[07:00:11] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin if it comes out, I wanna do the honors
[07:00:13] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: that's the way i read it too but i hadn't gone back to be sure
[07:00:24] <rwaldron> I'll provide a fresh pre-1.6.3 patch
[07:00:36] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: yeah if you want to back it out that's fine with me
[07:00:39] * rwaldron will be right back
[07:00:59] <Krinkle> fwiw, MediaWiki has a plugin called jquery.client which is fairly popular among the wiki community and a little bit outside. The plugin is more elaborate than $.browser.
[07:02:01] <timmywil> oh i see, sry I didn't get it before.  the original commit was in june, but the merge was aug. 4
[07:02:03] <Krinkle> it's a function that can be called with no arguments (or optionally a custom user agent, mostly done for unit testing), and returns an object with information about layout engine and browser name / version / versionBase.
[07:02:21] <timmywil> I think I like pulley even more now
[07:02:30] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: right, i've been using the github merge but yeah pulley seems like the way to go
[07:02:46] <timmywil> ok, but I think there's way to back out the merge
[07:02:46] <DaveMethvin> gh merge makes it look like things happened before they, er, happened
[07:02:52] <timmywil> yea
[07:03:16] <Krinkle> right now that plugin is only in mediawiki svn, but i have no problem putting that in the jQuery plugins repo and on the jquery website which ppl could use instead of browser (and perhaps turn $.browser into a light-weight plugin as well)
[07:03:37] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ah yes, you give it the parent numbers
[07:04:00] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: could you do that?
[07:04:12] <DaveMethvin> i gotta get better at git/github
[07:04:13] <timmywil> sure
[07:04:21] <rwaldron> timmywil no patch then?
[07:04:41] <DaveMethvin> if we can back out the original that is prolly a better audit trail
[07:05:41] <timmywil> rwaldron: lemme see. this might be a mess, but I'll give it a shot.
[07:06:20] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin +1
[07:12:24] <timmywil> rwaldron, DaveMethvin: how's that look https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commits/master
[07:12:43] <rwaldron> timmywil <3
[07:12:45] <DaveMethvin> yes!
[07:12:45] <rwaldron> nice one
[07:12:59] <DaveMethvin> so how hard was that do do timmywil?
[07:13:41] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: well instead of using the commit number, I had to follow the number of commits to the merge
[07:13:51] <DaveMethvin> ah, makes sense
[07:13:58] <DaveMethvin> and another reason to squash i guess
[07:14:08] <timmywil> ya
[07:14:21] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil you backed out your patch to #9699?
[07:14:48] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ha, sorry no.  The commit message actually just starts with the word "revert"
[07:14:56] <DaveMethvin> lol!!!
[07:15:04] <timmywil> wooooops
[07:15:15] <DaveMethvin> np, i was wondering how that  happened

[07:21:03] <timmywil> ah good idea
[07:21:09] <DaveMethvin> already linked in louisremi's blog post to explain the worm holes
[07:21:38] <DaveMethvin> can you land the two pulls that rwaldron had this morning?
[07:22:16] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yup
[07:22:21] <DaveMethvin> thanks!

[07:23:26] <DaveMethvin> sweet
[07:23:45] <timmywil> awesome
[07:29:51] <timmywil> bah, i broke it
[07:44:10] <timmywil> oh, nvm
[07:44:18] <timmywil> empty cache stupid timmy

[07:45:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah that cache has wasted more of my time ... dunno how often i think i broke something but didnt
[07:48:44] <matjas> hai guise
[07:49:04] <matjas> if we’re gonna add $.browser.chrome we should probably add $.browser.safari back in too, no?
[07:51:01] <rwaldron> matjas STFU.
[07:51:05] <rwaldron> ;)
[07:51:20] <timmywil> matjas: we're gonna pummel you
[07:51:36] <matjas> also when it’s gonna get added, why not improve the opera detection as well? no regex matching needed
[07:51:39] <matjas> ;)
[07:52:01] <matjas> I’d prefer just removing $.browser too ya know
[07:52:17] <matjas> but if there’ll be changes anyhow, might as well go all the way
[07:52:45] <timmywil> yea, this was my argument before.  We'll discuss before 1.7
[07:56:11] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, rwaldron: I've got two fails after going through all browsers.  One in Opera 11.50 and one in Safari 5.1
[07:56:22] <rwaldron> eek
[07:56:27] <rwaldron> what are the failures?
[07:56:49] <timmywil> http://gyazo.com/58fa45515f6ccb9a93ca42328607b026
[07:56:54] <timmywil> that's safari
[07:57:12] <timmywil> opera http://gyazo.com/dda74b46aa544ab5eb4eee70f74c8425
[07:57:32] <timmywil> I've seen the opera one before. I don't think we fixed it before 1.6.2
[07:57:47] <rwaldron> what the...
[07:57:52] <timmywil> it didn't make any sense to me
[07:58:34] <DaveMethvin> on the safari ones, there was a change to statusText docs#9854
[07:58:36] <bot-t1> [#9854]  (etc. This hasn't always been the case - in a 1.4.x version we used ""error"") - http://jqbug.com/9854
[07:58:40] <timmywil> the safari one is new to me
[08:00:38] <timmywil> I've gotta focus on work stuff right now, but I'll come back to it
[08:01:47] <DaveMethvin> np  .... btw i am getting the failure here too
[08:26:14] <DaveMethvin> it looks like Safari forces the statusText to be the standard ones based on the returned http code and doesn't allow custom messages
[08:34:17] <BlibbleKing> Hey, whats the best way to make sure a mouseover event is fired only once?
[08:34:28] <ajpiano> ?one
[08:34:28] <bot-t1> .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[08:34:40] <ajpiano> BlibbleKing: also, a great way is to make sure you direct support requests to #jquery
[08:34:47] <BlibbleKing> I am building a custome accordian slider, but it ques up the animations.
[08:34:55] <ajpiano> as this channel is for jquery development discussion, not support
[08:35:01] <BlibbleKing> kk
[13:50:34] <DaveMethvin> JohnResig: i don't have access to the code.jquery.com site, can you put the rc1 up there?

[15:43:47] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin!
[15:43:48] <jaubourg> :)
[15:43:53] <DaveMethvin> yay me!
[15:43:57] <jaubourg> just saw your mail
[15:44:18] <jaubourg> what version of safari?
[15:44:18] <DaveMethvin> so is safari being a pain?
[15:44:25] <DaveMethvin> it happens on 5.1 windows
[15:44:27] <jaubourg> I dunno need to check
[15:44:29] <jaubourg> ok
[15:44:38] <jaubourg> chrome doing ok?
[15:44:44] <DaveMethvin> chrome is fine
[15:44:45] <jaubourg> (probably safari being a pain)
[15:45:00] <DaveMethvin> don't think it shoudl stop us from doing an rc

[15:45:27] <DaveMethvin> don't have access to code.jquery.com

[15:46:09] <DaveMethvin> we have a hurricane coming
