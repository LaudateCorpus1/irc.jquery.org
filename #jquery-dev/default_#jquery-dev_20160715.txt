[00:59:29] <the133448>  Hi could anyone help me with this, http://codepen.io/the133448/pen/KrkqzO/
[00:59:42] <the133448> When you click the button it dissapears and the other buttons fills it place
[00:59:53] <the133448> however the animation is not smooth beetween each row
[13:22:39] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: You're right, I thought `which` didn't go in until IE10 but if it's IE9 we're good to pull that code
[13:23:31] <timmywil> I was going off, mdn, but I suspect it's correct because e.button behavior changed in IE9
[13:24:02] <DaveMethvin> i can't imagine browsers can pull that property for a LOOOONG time so we don't need to polyfill it
[13:25:06] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: did you create a ticket for it? Seems like it could be pulled in 3.2
[13:25:15] <timmywil> I didn't
[13:25:23] <DaveMethvin> i can do it if you want
[13:25:38] <timmywil> thanks, in the middle of something
