[07:13:38] <timmywil> mornin!
[07:13:47] <timmywil> yay shipping!
[07:14:00] <rwaldron> Can we run the test suites first?
[07:14:03] <rwaldron> each of us?
[07:14:21] <DaveMethvin> how about i get the final into place and then we test before announcing?
[07:14:28] <DaveMethvin> that way we know we're testing the real bits
[07:14:46] <rwaldron> perfect
[07:15:27] <DaveMethvin> just one change landed since rc1 right?
[07:15:31] <rwaldron> yep
[07:15:31] <DaveMethvin> rw
[07:15:38] <DaveMethvin> ok just being sure
[07:16:21] <DaveMethvin> is there anything else that *should* be in 1.6.3 rwaldron timmywil?
[07:16:32] * rwaldron looking
[07:16:37] <DaveMethvin> i didn't see any bug reports specific to it
[07:16:45] <timmywil> not that i can think of
[07:16:46] <DaveMethvin> which prolly means nobody else tested :/
[07:17:01] <rwaldron> all set
[07:17:02] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: it means the code is perfect!
[07:17:08] <DaveMethvin> lol!
[07:17:21] <rwaldron> I'm running tests for the current master now
[07:17:35] <rwaldron> Safari 5.0, 5.1: Pass
[07:17:41] <DaveMethvin> i'll do the same here as a basic sanity test
[07:18:59] <rwaldron> Chrome 13, 14 & 15 (Canary): Pass
[07:19:23] <DaveMethvin> damn i keep forgetting to start chrome in incognito mode
[07:22:46] <rwaldron> I forgot on the first 13 run
[07:22:59] <rwaldron> then when  bunch of shit failed I rememeber
[07:23:03] <rwaldron> remembered*
[07:24:23] <rwaldron> wtf.
[07:24:43] <DaveMethvin> wtf?
[07:25:01] <rwaldron> might be nothing
[07:25:02] <rwaldron> one sec
[07:25:58] <rwaldron> boom
[07:26:00] <rwaldron> it was nothing
[07:26:06] <DaveMethvin> i built 1.6.3
[07:26:15] <DaveMethvin> hmm, the tagging didn't seem to happen
[07:26:44] <DaveMethvin> oh duh it happened on my branch :P
[07:27:00] <rwaldron> there is actually no 1.6.3rc1 branch on master
[07:27:32] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/3z5BGw
[07:27:32] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Updating the source version to 1.6.4pre - Dave Methvin
[07:28:10] <DaveMethvin> hmm the tagging 1.6.3 STILL didn't happen
[07:28:54] <DaveMethvin> oh because i screwed up two days ago and tagged that as 1.6.3
[07:29:28] <DaveMethvin> lemme see how to fix that
[07:30:47] <gnarf> you guys want me to try 1.6.3 on ui?
[07:31:30] <rwaldron> Firefox 3.6.x, 6: Pass
[07:32:02] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: did 1.6.3rc1 work?
[07:32:15] * gnarf shrugs
[07:32:25] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[07:32:27] <rwaldron> ugh
[07:32:29] <rwaldron> ;)
[07:32:33] <rwaldron> gnarf yes please
[07:32:43] <DaveMethvin> let me see if i can get the code.jquery.com copy working
[07:33:31] <rwaldron> Opera 11.01, 11.50: Pass
[07:33:44] <rwaldron> That was a pain in the ass
[07:33:49] <rwaldron> i had to use 2 machines
[07:33:51] <DaveMethvin> something didn't go quite right with the release script
[07:34:02] <DaveMethvin> last time it pushed everything automagically
[07:34:06] <DaveMethvin> this time not so much
[07:34:07] <rwaldron> i need to get a real copy of windows xp and 7
[07:34:36] <rwaldron> er, what does that mean?
[07:35:42] <rwaldron> btw, i hate this lack of indentation...
[07:35:43] <rwaldron> http://gyazo.com/9dda032959501ea06260f8509b3ad475.png
[07:37:17] * gnarf finally realizes he's been forgeting "upstream"
[07:37:28] <gnarf> rebuilding
[07:37:29] <gnarf> one sec
[07:37:31] <gnarf> :)
[07:37:32] <timmywil> uhoh, DaveMethvin need some help?
[07:37:58] <DaveMethvin> mainly just trying to figure out what did/didn't happen
[07:38:06] <DaveMethvin> the right file got generated locally
[07:38:11] <DaveMethvin> didn't seem to make it to the cdn
[07:38:34] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: looks like version numbers got a little ahead of themselves
[07:38:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[07:38:58] <gnarf> yeah, same tests fail in 1.6.4pre than did in 1.6.2
[07:39:00] <DaveMethvin> so i should have tagged the other one as rc2
[07:39:15] <timmywil> 1.6.3pre again
[07:39:17] <DaveMethvin> gnarf is that good? :)
[07:39:24] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: I assume so ;)
[07:39:31] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: it didn't break anything new... so
[07:39:34] <timmywil> not rc2
[07:40:04] <timmywil> I can push a fix to the history
[07:40:12] <DaveMethvin> that would be great thanks
[07:40:26] <DaveMethvin> i think that may also explain the other prob as well, lemme check that
[07:41:46] * gnarf has piles of "day job" work to do today... cya round
[07:41:53] <DaveMethvin> thanks gnarf
[07:41:54] <timmywil> ok cool, you didn't actually change any tags
[07:42:22] <DaveMethvin> it would be really good if this script actually logged what it was doing
[07:50:58] <timmywil> well, no commit message, but I've created the 1.6.3rc1 tag where you committed the version change and removed the most recent commit.  I'm doing one more fix to get the current tag to be 1.6.3pre again where you committed 1.6.3.
[07:51:01] <timmywil> DaveMethvin
[07:51:16] <DaveMethvin> k thanks
[07:51:33] <DaveMethvin> for some reason the scp isn't working for me, altho it worked a coupla days ago
[07:51:39] <DaveMethvin> so i can't get the file to the cdn
[07:51:42] <DaveMethvin> timmywil:
[07:52:12] <timmywil> danheberden, JohnResig ?
[07:52:48] <danheberden> yo
[07:52:53] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[07:52:56] <danheberden> i mean
[07:52:57] <danheberden> um
[07:53:00] * danheberden leaves
[07:53:04] <DaveMethvin> come back!
[07:53:14] <danheberden> lalalalalalalala i can't hear you!
[07:53:19] <danheberden> so why no scp?
[07:53:26] <danheberden> Y U NO ADD RC1?!
[07:53:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's my line
[07:53:53] <danheberden> so what do y'all need?
[07:54:10] <danheberden> i mean, if you just needed another good looking dude in -dev, i'll hang out
[07:54:12] <DaveMethvin> well i have a coupla files i need to scp to the cdn and it won't
[07:54:24] <danheberden> weird
[07:54:37] <danheberden> wanna email/dropbox 'em
[07:54:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah seemed to work on monday after you added me
[07:54:41] <danheberden> and i'll throw them up?
[07:54:47] <DaveMethvin> sure
[07:55:38] <DaveMethvin> I just put them  in jQuery/Transfer, can you see those?
[07:56:06] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: ^
[07:56:24] <danheberden> got it
[07:56:27] <DaveMethvin> sweet
[07:56:51] <danheberden> so no rc tag?
[07:57:00] <danheberden> or are these 163 for serious
[07:57:19] <DaveMethvin> these are the real stuff
[07:57:24] <danheberden> awwwwwww yeah
[07:57:53] <DaveMethvin> btw guys i diffed against rc1 and it looked good, only rwaldron's pull
[08:00:29] <danheberden> up
[08:00:53] <danheberden> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.3.js
[08:00:59] <danheberden> now just to replace jquery-lateset
[08:01:12] <DaveMethvin> yeha!
[08:01:59] <danheberden> all done
[08:03:04] <DaveMethvin> so i get the purge msg instead of the file .. lemme clear my cache
[08:03:38] <rwaldron> nice :)
[08:03:46] <rwaldron> er
[08:03:50] <rwaldron> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.6.3.js
[08:03:52] <rwaldron> not found
[08:04:05] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin^
[08:04:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah danheberden me too
[08:04:28] <DaveMethvin> i get the "attempting to purge" message
[08:04:29] <rwaldron> oh whoops
[08:04:36] <rwaldron> da + tab
[08:04:37] <DaveMethvin> even tho i'm not adding ?reload
[08:05:03] <rwaldron> what does ?reload do?
[08:05:42] <DaveMethvin> tells the cdn you updated the file
[08:06:12] <DaveMethvin> not something mortals shoudl ever do
[08:07:42] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron timmywil Any need to update the release notes for the blog entry? Seems like the one change we made was a small detail and it didn't have its own ticket anyway.
[08:08:01] <timmywil> nah, no biggie
[08:08:16] <DaveMethvin> So i wonder if I shoudl just post a link saying it's out and linking back to the rc1 post ?
[08:08:27] <DaveMethvin> i mean, otherwise it's a full-on copypasta
[08:08:30] <timmywil> changing a past commit is hard
[08:08:58] <timmywil> if it was the most recent, it would be easy cakes
[08:09:13] <DaveMethvin> oh you mean the tag?
[08:09:19] <timmywil> no i fixed the tag
[08:09:25] <timmywil> i mean the commit that updated the version to 1.6.3
[08:09:32] <timmywil> should be 1.6.3pre from that point
[08:09:40] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[08:10:09] <timmywil> well, ok, i can do it.  just a sec
[08:10:14] <DaveMethvin> can we back out the commit?
[08:10:39] <timmywil> well, should really be 1.6.3pre before landing the latest pull
[08:10:49] <timmywil> if we wanna be anal about it
[08:10:53] <timmywil> but i can do it
[08:10:56] <DaveMethvin> right
[08:11:56] <DaveMethvin> back in about 5 minutes...
[08:11:58] <danheberden> rwaldron DaveMethvin can you check the url again to make sure things propagated?
[08:12:58] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil force-pushed master from 5d89965 to f035c44: http://git.io/9cZXpQ

[08:16:50] <DaveMethvin> danheberden: yep, looks like both the normal and min are there now, thanks!  what needed to be done?
[08:17:02] <danheberden> me not be retarded
[08:17:09] <danheberden> :D
[08:17:10] <DaveMethvin> lol
[08:17:26] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/JuNbVw
[08:17:26] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Landing pull request 478. Apply fixes as noted by Diego Perini, David Murdoch & Mathias Bynens. Supplements #9634 Fixes #9634. - Rick Waldron
[08:17:30] <DaveMethvin> well at least it likes you enough to do it right eventually
[08:17:39] <rwaldron> looks good
[08:18:46] <timmywil> OK, that was fun
[08:19:05] <timmywil> let's not do that again hehe
[08:19:16] <DaveMethvin> yeah, soorry
[08:19:29] <timmywil> no worries :)
[08:19:32] <DaveMethvin> so we need a tag for 1.6.3 though, right?
[08:20:06] <timmywil> first, remake your master branch
[08:20:28] <timmywil> then when you push, you'll do git push --tags upstream master
[08:20:38] <timmywil> which will update the tags upstream
[08:20:45] <timmywil> otherwise it won't get pushed
[08:21:00] <timmywil> which I'm guessing is what happened
[08:21:42] <timmywil> to create a tag manually, do git tag 1.6.3, but I'm also guessing the script does that part
[08:22:50] <DaveMethvin> lemme look at my local log here
[08:24:05] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin timmywil do either of you know of any occurences in the source where jQuery is checking the length property of a function?
[08:24:19] <rwaldron> eg. function f( a, b, c, ) {}
[08:24:24] <rwaldron> f.length === 3
[08:24:41] <rwaldron> (not in that form specifically)
[08:24:44] <DaveMethvin> not offhand rwaldron but it does sound familiar
[08:25:11] <timmywil> rwaldron: can't think of a place
[08:25:12] <DaveMethvin> i seem to recall there being some duck type thing that snover did a few months ago that might need to know that
[08:25:15] <rwaldron> i wish jaubourg was here
[08:25:30] <timmywil> I'd look in data first tho
[08:25:52] <rwaldron> yeha I'm looking there
[08:25:54] <rwaldron> yeah*
[08:26:05] <rwaldron> good to know I'm on the same track
[08:26:27] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: the current version should be 1.6.4pre now that 1.6.3 is out, right?
[08:26:35] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: right
[08:26:42] <rwaldron> are we planning a 1.6.4?
[08:26:44] <timmywil> but 1.6.4pre is not tagged
[08:26:47] <rwaldron> or is that just practice
[08:26:48] <timmywil> oh right
[08:26:51] <timmywil> 1.7pre
[08:26:59] <rwaldron> gotcha
[08:27:04] <DaveMethvin> well how does/should that work?
[08:27:18] <rwaldron> didnt know if we just did 1.6.Xpre by defalt
[08:27:20] <rwaldron> default*
[08:27:29] <rwaldron> and then changed as we moved forward
[08:27:52] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: change version.txt to 1.6.3, run release.js
[08:28:06] <DaveMethvin> release.js does a bunch of stuff we don't want to do at this point
[08:28:24] <timmywil> ah ok
[08:29:23] <timmywil> in that case, change version.txt, commit and push.  git tag 1.6.3 git push --tags
[08:29:48] <timmywil> then change version.txt to 1.7pre, commit, push. done
[08:30:16] <DaveMethvin> thinking...
[08:31:19] <rwaldron> timmywil you've been doing heavy listing in Sizzle right?
[08:31:25] <rwaldron> lifting* that is
[08:31:47] <timmywil> rwaldron: in the process. I plan to dig in tonight
[08:31:52] <DaveMethvin> ok timmywil i agree, that looks right
[08:32:35] <rwaldron> ok
[08:33:06] <rwaldron> So i just had a quick PM with snover and he confirmed that he did not write code that ever checked the length of a function
[08:33:20] <DaveMethvin> ok good
[08:33:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: first commit "Tagging the 1.6.3 release", next "Updating version number to 1.7pre"
[08:33:51] <rwaldron> The reason I'm asking is because es-discuss is using jQuery as an example of code that _DOES_ check function arity length property
[08:34:03] <rwaldron> which i immediately thought was incorrect.
[08:34:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah just double checking some stuff to figure out what the script actually did/didn't do timmywil
[08:34:14] <timmywil> cool
[08:34:59] <timmywil> rwaldron: yea sounds strange
[08:35:06] <timmywil> but not illegal i suppose
[08:36:09] <rwaldron> I just want to provide them with accurate info from jQuery
[08:36:58] <rwaldron> because as it turns out, 24million users is a seriously paved cowpath
[08:49:58] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/H1ynpA
[08:49:58] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Tagging the 1.6.3 release. - Dave Methvin
[08:53:59] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/g9Tnrw
[08:53:59] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Updating the source version to 1.7pre. - Dave Methvin
[08:54:43] <DaveMethvin> and there was great rejoicing.
[08:56:06] <DaveMethvin> figured out what happened with the release script ... it was a problem with my cygwin setup under Windows
[08:56:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: good to know :)
[08:56:50] <DaveMethvin> it couldn't find my user dotfiles like .ssh so it silently failed to do half the stuff :(
[08:57:03] <timmywil> lamesauce
[08:57:08] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[08:57:51] <DaveMethvin> ok, well at least the commit history doesn't look butchered ... thanks for the help timmywil
[08:58:11] <timmywil> np, was kinda fun

[09:02:01] <timmywil> so, do we manage jqcommit or jquerycommits?
[09:02:16] <timmywil> they seem to do the same thing
[09:02:46] <DaveMethvin> does jqcommit tweet as well?
[09:02:55] <timmywil> yup
[09:03:18] <DaveMethvin> sho nuff
[09:03:24] <DaveMethvin> yeah seems like redundant
[09:03:49] <DaveMethvin> i don't know where either of them come from
[09:06:11] <DaveMethvin> I'll get on the blog post after lunch
[09:07:42] <timmywil> OK, i just double checked all the IE's, FFs, and Chrome/Opera/Safari latest.  Still get that XML fail in Opera and the same ajax error in Safari.
[09:08:00] <timmywil> I'm not really worried about the xml fail, but I thought jaubourg fixed the safari one
[09:09:27] <peol> timmywil: DaveMethvin: I just put jquerycommits in here, thought it was you guys that hooked it up. Wanna remove it?
[09:10:09] <timmywil> not until we figure out who wanted it in
[09:10:15] <timmywil> maybe there was a reason
[09:15:08] <timmywil> rwaldron: have you already updated your master? (don't yet)
[09:15:58] <rwaldron> i havent updated since I did earlier today
[09:16:10] <rwaldron> I've been working on Function.prototype.__doc__
[09:16:15] <rwaldron> https://gist.github.com/1160879
[09:16:57] <timmywil> cool, can you do a local git log and see if any of the history is different than upstream before the "Tagging the 1.6.3rc1 release" commit
[09:17:10] <timmywil> just checking something
[09:17:10] <JohnResig> rwaldron: I thought support for accessing serialized comments was mixed across browsers?
[09:18:10] <rwaldron> this is something I came up with based on a proposal by Dmitry Soshnikov on es-discuss
[09:18:36] <rwaldron> I was jsut curious to see how it might work in "today" javascript
[09:18:46] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i think we lost the pull from jaubourg for silencing the safari ajax issue but it's no big deal
[09:18:56] <rwaldron> realistic use cases would be JS at the terminal
[09:18:58] <DaveMethvin> it used $.browser so i think jaubourg did it to make me laugh
[09:19:04] <timmywil> yea, i thought so
[09:19:10] <rwaldron> as you would with Python
[09:19:27] <timmywil> sry guys! i must have missed a pull before pushing
[09:19:47] <DaveMethvin> lets leave it out for now b/c all the patch was doing is ignoring the fail
[09:19:59] <timmywil> yea, too late now
[09:20:10] <timmywil> oh, it just changed the test?
[09:20:15] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:20:15] <timmywil> oh i feel better then
[09:20:34] <timmywil> lol and it did $.browser??? hahahaha
[09:20:45] <matjas> .tweet mathias
[09:20:47] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from mathias: Updated the jQuery file size visualization: http://t.co/ULX3qa0 The gzipped + minified version of jQuery 1.6.3 is 5 bytes larger than 1.6.2. ★ http://bit.ly/oMIDVr
[09:20:57] <matjas> 5 BYTES!!1
[09:21:12] <timmywil> wat?!?!
[09:21:25] <rwaldron> matjas would be useful to note how much of current jQuery uncompressed is comments
[09:21:34] <timmywil> WE NEEDS MOAR BYTES
[09:21:42] <matjas> rwaldron: agreed
[09:21:43] <rwaldron> ack. be back
[09:21:49] <DaveMethvin> by this measure, 1.6.3 has failed! :P
[09:21:52] <matjas> although no one should use jQuery uncompressed
[09:22:12] <timmywil> true, i think people understand that tho
[09:22:23] <timmywil> uncompressed size doesn't mean much
[09:22:24] <matjas> DaveMethvin: if you wanna get rid of ’em bytes, may i suggest something like https://github.com/mathiasbynens/jquery/commit/489245ec5e7853b7442b97e194af66e488e0e79c? :D
[09:22:24] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by mathiasbynens (3w, 3d ago): Save some bytes by using mothereffing unquoted attribute values in innerHTML.
[09:22:38] <timmywil> uncompiled* that is
[09:22:51] <matjas> yeah the more comments the better
[09:23:12] <DaveMethvin> matjas: i think rwaldron used that didn't he?
[09:23:27] <matjas> he pussied out in the end
[09:23:44] <matjas> they’re safe optimizations
[09:23:51] <DaveMethvin> oh that rwaldron ... :P

More Details:     - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/478     - http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9634
[09:24:32] <matjas> well he dropped the solidi
[09:24:41] <matjas> `/>` → `>`
[09:24:47] <matjas> it’s definitely a start :)
[09:24:59] <matjas> i can file a bug + proper PR if you guys are willing to consider this
[09:25:00] <DaveMethvin> i have a dream that 1.7 will be smaller
[09:25:55] <DaveMethvin> matjas can you file it in about 2-3 weeks once we land the new 1.7 stuff? wouldn't hurt to have another set of eyes on that as well
[09:26:09] <matjas> DaveMethvin: deal
[09:26:15] <DaveMethvin> sweet!
[09:27:48] <timmywil> Callbacks might add some
[09:27:55] <timmywil> overall
[09:31:44] <timmywil> brb
[09:36:40] <matjas> any reason document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0] is used here instead of document.body? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/a42273807d2b1b1ff1362c1b9fc4cb48f65fda11/src/support.js#L141
[09:36:47] * matjas is probably missing something
[09:41:50] <DaveMethvin> matjas: rwaldron probably knows
[09:42:09] <DaveMethvin> there are definitely some degenerate cases there, like frameset pages have a document.body but no body tag
[10:09:33] <matjas> rwaldron: any reason document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0] is used here instead of document.body? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/a42273807d2b1b1ff1362c1b9fc4cb48f65fda11/src/support.js#L141
[10:09:46] <rwaldron> I was just looking at that
[10:10:07] <rwaldron> did you run this in IE6,7,8?
[10:11:23] <rwaldron> matjas ^
[10:11:50] <matjas> not yet, but i bet it works
[10:12:01] * matjas made a git booboo and is cleaning it up now :(
[10:12:47] <rwaldron> ugh
[10:13:11] <rwaldron> i'm going to have to fucking rebase my fixedPosition branch to make nice with this
[10:13:33] <rwaldron> so, not to be a butthead, but can you make sure you run it in IE6,7,8
[10:14:38] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin timmywil we should clear some junk from the pull request queue
[10:14:56] <rwaldron> things that are closed can be reopened if nec.
[10:14:59] <rwaldron> but there is clutter
[10:15:12] <DaveMethvin> i agree ... right now i'm cleaning out the event bug report
[10:15:28] <matjas> rwaldron: yeah sure i will
[10:15:29] <rwaldron> cool
[10:15:36] <rwaldron> thanks matjas, i appreciate it
[10:15:37] <matjas> no butthead :)
[10:15:47] <rwaldron> btw, i added your suggestion to the jquery bug fixin guide
[10:15:51] <rwaldron> ?jqbugz

[10:29:09] <danheberden> christ matjas you're just goin to town
[10:29:13] <DaveMethvin> matjas: can we just close all those pulls and you start again??
[10:29:20] <matjas> small no-brainer commits ftw
[10:29:27] <matjas> BYTESSS
[10:29:30] <danheberden> rwaldron matjas document.body works in ie6+
[10:29:38] <danheberden> if you didn't test yet for yourselves
[10:29:46] <DaveMethvin> i thought we agreed a few milliseconds ago that you'd wait until mid-sept for these anyway
[10:29:48] <matjas> i didn’t test yet but i knew it did
[10:29:57] <matjas> GOT TOO EXCITED
[10:30:08] <matjas> imma give you guys till mid-sept to review ’em
[10:31:06] <DaveMethvin> honest matjas it's nice to have the help but i'd rather see a single pr with a well-considered and tested set of changes
[10:31:12] <DaveMethvin> rather than a few bytes per pr
[10:31:20] <DaveMethvin> including several mistates along the way
[10:31:32] <DaveMethvin> er, misteaks!
[10:31:37] <matjas> :D
[10:34:56] <matjas> </spam>
[10:37:40] <rwaldron> danheberden maybe so
[10:37:51] <rwaldron> i'm just a little scarred from yesterday
[10:54:07] <danzik17> if youre making the assumption that document.body exists in support, i'd imagine the check for document.body could be removed from https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/core.js#L97, no?  /back to lurking
[10:57:43] <DaveMethvin> danzik17: yep, you'd imagine that, so most likely one of those assumptions is wrong, eh? :)
[10:59:06] <DaveMethvin> here's the long story about it: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7398
[11:17:54] <matjas> FTR, i didn’t assume document.body exists in support (else we could get rid of the ternary + if), i just assumed that document.body === document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0] in all cases
[11:18:18] <matjas> but as DaveMethvin said, it’s different in frameset docs
[11:20:37] <rwaldron> also, in support, we create a fake body at some point... might be unrelated
[11:20:43] <rwaldron> i'm not looking at code at the moment
[11:41:45] <peol> timmywil: DaveMethvin: no one "wanted" it, i added it myself, thought it would fit in here :)
[11:42:01] <peol> re tweets from jquerycommits
[11:42:37] <DaveMethvin> peol: since we have jqcommit it seems redundant at this point
[11:42:54] <DaveMethvin> so it was such a good idea we did it too peol! :)
[11:43:18] <peol> DaveMethvin: true, i never noticed jqcommit
[11:44:29] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: when's the blog post going up?
[11:44:39] <peol> .restart
[11:44:39] <socialhapy> ★ Restarting... I was up for 1 day, 3 hours
[11:44:44] <DaveMethvin> working on it now
[11:44:49] <DaveMethvin> timmywil:
[11:44:56] <timmywil> cool
[11:44:58] <timmywil> and cdn is straight?
[11:45:02] <DaveMethvin> yep
[11:45:08] <timmywil> rawk
[11:45:35] <DaveMethvin> rawk, is that good?
[11:45:53] <timmywil> rock like a hawk
[11:46:03] <DaveMethvin> oh good1
[11:46:57] <timmywil> im making that up
[11:47:20] <DaveMethvin> so timmywil what do you think we should do about the post itself, copy over everyting in the rc1 post or just point back to it?
[11:47:41] <timmywil> copy over
[11:47:44] <DaveMethvin> the copy-pasta seems so ugly but it's kinda nice to have the post be self contained
[11:47:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[11:47:49] <DaveMethvin> ok then
[11:48:04] <timmywil> it's what we've done in the past
