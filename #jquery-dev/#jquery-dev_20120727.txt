[03:09:44] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Add update browsetSet defaults to include Firefox 14 - Jörn Zaefferer
[03:39:10] <_|Nix|_> Hey! As of jQuery 1.7.2, $( document ).height() returns the wrong value on Webkit browsers. Is this a known issue?
[04:31:33] <_|Nix|_> I did a git bisect and it seems 5cae50e66e34c277412c01ccb1c24bd6a85d2d8a breaks it.
[04:32:41] <_|Nix|_> And the icing on the cake is that 5cae50e66e34c277412c01ccb1c24bd6a85d2d8a was created to accomodate IE6.
[04:32:47] <_|Nix|_> ... and it breaks Webkit.
[05:11:56] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: have you tried vs git?
[05:12:12] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: "vs git"?
[05:12:21] <gnarf> I know mikesherov rewrote a whole lot of height/width stuff for 1.8
[05:12:29] <gnarf> yeah, jquery-git
[05:12:30] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: If you mean the latest git, it has a parse error.
[05:12:34] <gnarf> master?
[05:12:40] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[05:12:59] <gnarf> m
[05:13:05] <gnarf> are you sure you're on master?
[05:13:06] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: I'm now looking into commits later than the above that touch src/dimensions.js to see if it's already fixed.
[05:13:09] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: I am.
[05:13:16] <gnarf> cuz it built fine for the rc1 push
[05:14:30] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: ba70f8aeb60038ae73b188e432c471f3b115a790 is a revert of that commit, so it may already be fixed.
[05:14:50] <gnarf> i'm pretty sure it is
[05:15:13] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: I'll try to find something buildable and runnable after that commit and issue a $( document ).height() on my favourite page to see if it's fixed.
[05:15:23] <gnarf> can you test with http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js ?
[05:16:17] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'touchstart' of undefined
[05:16:36] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: that seems like a plugin error?
[05:17:42] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: that build is totally stable ^^^
[05:17:46] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/408
[05:22:06] <_|Nix|_> gnarf: OK. I'll have to continue my quest later. Daughter woke up. Thanks for your help!
[05:42:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: .
[05:42:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah?
[05:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> What are you looking for in the page boilerplate?
[05:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> Did you see the example I posted at the bottom of the page?
[05:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> The I can throw a boilerplate at the bottom, it'll be super tiny though.
[05:43:48] <scott_gonzalez> s/The//
[05:44:58] <scott_gonzalez> The boilerplate will also be different for different projects.
[05:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> Like a test page for jQuery UI will have a lot more biolerplate.
[06:02:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah - just a simple skeleton would be useful :)

[06:02:43] <gnarf> $.attrFn ???
[06:03:01] <gnarf> the behavior it has bothers me
[06:03:14] <gnarf> now its completely removed, but the behavior still exists
[06:03:55] <gnarf> .attr( prop, value ) -> if ( $.fn[prop] ) { this[ prop ]( value ); }
[06:04:04] <gnarf> seems like super dangerous
[06:04:52] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[06:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> I really like exposing events.

[06:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right it's no longer needed.
[06:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> Nevermind.
[06:06:55] <gnarf> now that i see WHY it's being done
[06:07:02] <gnarf> it makes a ton of sense
[06:07:21] <DaveMethvin> how does it make sense?
[06:08:16] <DaveMethvin> really, none of our (mobile, ui, core) functionality shoudl be using $(html, props), it's too fragile
[06:08:36] <DaveMethvin> anyone who adds something on $.fn can break your code
[06:10:09] <DaveMethvin> i REALLY dislike the $.fn.eventname shortcuts anyway, they don't work for delegation for example
[06:10:57] <gnarf> shouldn't that "props" portion get pre-filtered rather than letting "attr" be the guy responsible for that?
[06:13:37] <DaveMethvin> i think there's code in ui that expects attr to be thusly polluted
[06:13:59] <gnarf> eww
[06:14:08] <gnarf> attr is all sorts of bad now
[06:14:22] <DaveMethvin> i still haven't given up on removing that
[06:14:22] <gnarf> we need like a "realAttr" ;)
[06:14:48] <DaveMethvin> we have several apis like $.fn.data that have private args to public apis
[06:14:57] <DaveMethvin> that makes duck punching awfully risky
[06:15:26] <DaveMethvin> same with attr

[06:20:57] <gnarf> so ugly
[06:21:48] <DaveMethvin> fortunately gnarf, it "just works" for 1.8 .... for some definition of "works"
[06:23:03] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, but now there is this >=1.6 <1.8 branch of code ;)

[06:51:46] <ajpiano> .tweet louis_remi
[06:51:48] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from Louis_Remi: I just found a large block of useless code in jQuery: the part that makes focus/blur events compatible with .delegate() ★ http://bit.ly/MK3inB
[06:51:56] <louisremi> ajpiano: yep
[06:53:12] <louisremi> According to the spec, those events shouldn't bubble. focusin/focusout should bubble.
[06:53:21] <louisremi> I thought that wasn't really a problem at first
[06:53:54] <gnarf> louisremi: the fact that we bubble them is kinda the point tho
[06:54:17] <louisremi> we maintain our API and use focusin/focusout to simulate bubbling focus/blur
[06:54:26] <louisremi> right?
[06:54:45] <gnarf> eh - i don't remember - ask DaveMethvin
[06:55:19] <louisremi> but... focus/blur don't bubble anymore in Firefox since version 3.something
[06:55:47] <DaveMethvin> louisremi: not sure about the specific code you are talking about
[06:55:56] <DaveMethvin> but the behavior of "focus"
[06:56:09] <DaveMethvin> is that most people expect a delegated "focus" to bubble
[06:56:13] <DaveMethvin> so we use "focusin"
[06:56:16] <DaveMethvin> to emulate that
[06:56:24] <DaveMethvin> i would have preferred not to, but we let that cat out
[06:56:29] <DaveMethvin> and we cannot stuff it back in
[06:57:14] <louisremi> DaveMethvin: certainly, but what I'm outlining is that we maintain an API that isn't cross-browser anymore : focus and blur don't bubble in Firefox
[06:57:34] <DaveMethvin> i don't know that they bubble *anywhere* anymore
[06:57:52] <DaveMethvin> http://api.jquery.com/on/  search for "focus" on the page
[06:58:26] <DaveMethvin> and at this point i think most browsers support focusin/out so we don't need to fake them
[07:00:02] <louisremi> DaveMathvin: Firefox doesn't support them and they aren't working actively on the related bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=687787
[07:01:29] <louisremi> DaveMethvin: so the behavior "translate focus/blur to focusin/focusout" should be deprecated, shouldn't it?
[07:01:55] <louisremi> I think it should, since it's not cross-browser anymore
[07:02:14] <DaveMethvin> louisremi: all that happens inside jquery is that if you say "focus" for a delegated event it changes the name to "focusin"
[07:02:24] <DaveMethvin> and actually delivers a "focusin"
[07:02:41] <DaveMethvin> it seems like unnecessary breakage to remove that
[07:02:55] <DaveMethvin> and this is coming from a guy who's wielding a machete to 1.9 :D
[07:03:25] <louisremi> DaveMethvin: what's the point of keeping it if it's not reliable?
[07:03:38] <DaveMethvin> it's very reliable afaik
[07:03:41] <DaveMethvin> OH
[07:03:55] <DaveMethvin> we create a bubbling focusin/focusout if the browser doesn't support it
[07:04:00] <DaveMethvin> that is probably what had you confused
[07:04:40] <DaveMethvin> here let me go look for the cod
[07:04:41] <DaveMethvin> e
[07:04:48] <louisremi> I'm guilty of not writing a test before tweeting, let me see...
[07:05:25] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L841
[07:05:39] <DaveMethvin> i suspect that is only used by firefox now
[07:05:52] <DaveMethvin> i think chrome added focusin/out a while back and ie has had it forever
[07:19:42] <louisremi> DaveMethvin: ok, my bad, I assumed focus/blur weren't compatible with delegate in Firefox any longer, and I was wrong. But I still don't understand how jquery makes it possible... I'll search
[07:20:01] <DaveMethvin> louisremi: MAGIC https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js#L841
[07:20:51] <DaveMethvin> we intercept the non-bubbling focus/blur in the event capture phase and bubble it back up
[07:21:10] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[07:21:55] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: hi!
[07:22:02] <louisremi> DaveMethvin: of course... how did I forget about this possibility? Sorry for wasting your time guys

[07:24:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I'd like to know who this magical half-woman is
[07:25:30] <DaveMethvin> well if one woman can make a baby in 9 months, two should be able to do it in 4.5 months, and 1.5 in 6 months ... right?
[07:25:31] <timmywil> and what advantages does she provide in making a baby?
[07:25:48] <DaveMethvin> that's the old mythical man month rule of software dev
[07:26:19] <timmywil> :)
[07:26:32] <DaveMethvin> don't you know ANYTHING about baby math, timmywil? :D
[07:27:06] <DaveMethvin> oh speaking of sw dev we had an interesting bug come in this morning, did  you see it?

[07:28:29] <ajpiano> :p
[07:28:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah i tried pinging you last night, it was late

[07:29:04] <ajpiano> oh ok, will do now!
[07:29:10] <DaveMethvin> thanks, sorry!
[07:29:16] <DaveMethvin> i tweeted on my acct

[07:36:26] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: are you referencing #12153 ?
[07:36:55] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: yeah

[07:37:23] <bot-t> [#12153] Error occurs in the selector (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/12153
[07:38:18] <DaveMethvin> there is another complicated selector pending that may be related

[07:38:22] <bot-t> [#12141] Filter works ok in 1.7.1 but not in 1.8b2 (pending bug) - http://jqbug.com/12141
[07:38:26] <gibson042> it's kinda hairy... I don't think Sizzle can use rgroups as a shortcut for tokenize, eh timmywil?
[07:38:40] <gibson042> pseudos are hard
[07:38:48] <DaveMethvin> let's go shopping
[07:39:42] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I don't think 12141 is an issue anymore
[07:42:15] <gibson042> timmywil: I have unit tests that show the problem of 12153, but I may not get to a fix before you can
[07:42:26] <gibson042> shall I PR just the units?
[07:42:40] <timmywil> gibson042: sure, that'd be helpful
[07:42:56] <gibson042> ok
[07:44:43] <gibson042> to summarize the problem: the psuedos regex pattern captures as much as it can between parentheses when the contents are unquoted, including commas that would otherwise separate simple components of a compound selector
[07:45:35] <timmywil> yea i understand
[07:46:45] <timmywil> gibson042: your original solution of throwing an error for unquoted comma is looking better
[07:47:39] <gibson042> I don't think we can do that, though: "*:not(script, style)"
[07:48:00] <timmywil> nvm, that was unquoted parens
[07:48:10] <gibson042> right
[07:49:33] <gibson042> I think this just reinforces the inability of regex to do context-free tokenization

[12:55:51] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: ever notice that a regex just tends to get bigger and bigger? :)
[12:56:32] <DaveMethvin> well you nailed the "not a comma" part for sure
[12:57:02] <timmywil> I'm going for including any comma that is within brackets/parens or is escaped in the pseudo argument
[12:57:26] <timmywil> quotes is already covered
[12:59:57] <DaveMethvin> whoa that was a lame test case
[13:00:02] <DaveMethvin> the old one
[13:00:19] <timmywil> heh, don't tell gibson
[13:00:52] <timmywil> this seems to cover the majority of use cases
[13:01:02] <timmywil> it could be tricked
[13:01:19] <timmywil> but it would take doing something I don't understand at the moment
