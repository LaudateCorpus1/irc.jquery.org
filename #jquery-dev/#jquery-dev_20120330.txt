[07:58:26] <jzaefferer> hey Krinkle, what TestSwarm page could/should I work on?
[07:58:42] <Krinkle> Hi
[07:59:05] <jzaefferer> Also, where should I put my commits? Fork your repo to my account and send PRs against yours?
[07:59:19] <jzaefferer> Or push your branch to jquery/testswarm?
[07:59:26] <Krinkle> hm..
[07:59:34] <Krinkle> I'll PR my master to jquery first
[07:59:43] <Krinkle> then import my issue132 branch
[07:59:46] <jzaefferer> The latter makes sense, as we both have write access to the latter anyway
[07:59:54] <Krinkle> (the latter you'll have to help me with)
[07:59:55] <Krinkle> importing branch
[08:00:00] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:00:07] <jzaefferer> merge master, then push the branch
[08:00:46] <jzaefferer> Though that's really easy
[08:01:18] <jzaefferer> Assuming origin is Krinkle/testswarm, upstream is jquery/testswarm, just `git push upstream issue132`
[08:02:55] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Should I PR master at all? I should be able to push directly
[08:02:59] <Krinkle> I only have minor changes in my master
[08:03:06] <jzaefferer> Yeah, just push
[08:03:46] <Krinkle> git push upstream master?
[08:04:54] <Krinkle> git remote` gives me jquery-testswarm and origin
[08:04:57] <Krinkle> so I'll use jquery-testswarm
[08:05:29] <Krinkle> oh, I have to fast forward first
[08:07:52] <jqcommit> [testswarm] Krinkle pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/2py0rQ
[08:07:52] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] Merge remote-tracking branch 'jquery-testswarm/master' - Krinkle
[08:08:20] <jqcommit> [testswarm] Krinkle created issue132 (+24 new commits): http://git.io/x3Uiuw
[08:08:20] <jqcommit> [testswarm/issue132] update getRequest for 8644289dad8cc7be26b12b5b4d7d37390b6cbcaa - Krinkle

[08:08:20] <jqcommit> [testswarm/issue132] [issue #132] More page-action renaming - Krinkle
[08:09:10] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: Okay, now that we have a branch to work on, what page should I look at?
[08:09:30] <Krinkle> checkout/install first, just making sure it all works
[08:09:35] <Krinkle> (you too?)
[08:11:47] <Krinkle> the only change I had to make when I switched jquery-testswarm to issue132 on my localhost was update .htaccess from -sample
[08:13:25] <Krinkle> when you're there, home, login, and run should work fine
[08:17:59] <jzaefferer> Okay, got that working
[08:19:58] <jzaefferer> And I gotta go very soon. I'll work on this over the weekend or on Monday
[08:20:50] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: ok
[08:21:28] <Krinkle> so basically git mv pages/foo pages/FooPage, and actions/foo actions/FooAction
[08:21:32] <Krinkle> for action, create a class that extends action and does setError or setData
[08:22:25] <Krinkle> and in the Page, execute() create an instance of that action and display <div class="error box"> if there is error, and then continue using the data from $action->getData() in content()
[08:22:32] <Krinkle> (and add 2 lines in init.php for the autoloader)
[08:22:38] <Krinkle> that's pretty much it
[08:22:49] <Krinkle> look at past commits by for for examples
[08:23:29] <Krinkle> pages that only do json responses are a bit akward right now since those shouldn't be a page but just an API, so those are a 3-line page now that just  echo's json_encode the data and exit;
[08:24:02] <jzaefferer> Okay
[08:24:15] <jzaefferer> You aren't working on that now, right?
[08:24:20] <Krinkle> convert whatever page/action pair you like. Those that aren't a pair are best left for later.
[08:24:37] <Krinkle> I'm going to catch a train in 1-2 hours (which will be a 3-4 hour ride)
[08:24:44] <Krinkle> I do plan to make 1 or 2 converts
[08:24:54] <jzaefferer> so addjob, job, scores, signup and user?
[08:25:03] <Krinkle> sounds right
[08:25:13] <jzaefferer> okay, then I'll just pull tomorrow and work on what remains
[08:25:33] <Krinkle> OK
[08:26:06] <Krinkle> Im trying to keep the convention of starting with " [issue #132] " + names of converted actions/pages
[08:26:11] <Krinkle> so that it shows up nice in #132 history

[12:15:26] <bot-t> [#11153] jQuery 1.7 Strips Carriage Returns in IE 8 (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/11153
[12:15:30] <timmywil> Someone tweeted me about this
[12:15:37] <DaveMethvin> did they tweet a patch?
[12:15:39] <timmywil> I don't actually remember why I stripped carriage returns
[12:15:39] <DaveMethvin> :)
[12:16:06] <DaveMethvin> do you strip them? I thought ie8 did
[12:16:28] <timmywil> I strip them when innerText is used
[12:16:37] <DaveMethvin> oh ... hmm
[12:16:42] <timmywil> I did it on purpose
[12:16:45] <timmywil> but idk why
[12:17:03] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure either
[12:17:08] <DaveMethvin> i thought ie8 was doing it
[12:17:13] <timmywil> I'm checking IE7 suite
[12:17:22] <DaveMethvin> i know it treats whitespace diff than other browsers
[12:17:27] <DaveMethvin> ie 6/7/8 that is
[12:17:33] <timmywil> It could be for consistency
[12:17:37] <DaveMethvin> i had a ticket that was open forever bout that
[12:18:02] <timmywil> maybe people were relying on carriage returns in IE, even though they're not present in other browsers
[12:19:41] <DaveMethvin> well we warn the heck out of people expecting the same whitespace in IE in the docs, but any changes probably broke something
[12:19:43] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3144
[12:20:04] <DaveMethvin> > "should IE's CR-LF sequences be changed to LF for consistency with the other browsers? "
[12:20:07] <timmywil> I vaguely remember a fail in ajax and removing carriage returns fixed it
[12:20:14] <DaveMethvin> see, that's what you get for listening to that crank's ticket
[12:21:19] <DaveMethvin> oh but it stripped \n and not \r
[12:21:27] <DaveMethvin> i think we want to preserve the \n
[12:21:48] <timmywil> yea, I would think that too
[12:22:04] <DaveMethvin> if you ask me, anyone depending on whitespace across elements is asking for trouble, but of course that doesn't stop ppl from trying
[12:23:07] <timmywil> yea, the newline isn't present in IE7 http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/8DPFc/
[12:23:15] <timmywil> WHY did I do this
[12:23:28] <timmywil> tell me now
[12:23:32] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:24:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah that don't seem right
[12:24:25] <timmywil> having trouble with browserstack
[12:25:01] <DaveMethvin> otoh there is no guarantee there is space across elements: http://jsfiddle.net/dmethvin/TeVPW/
[12:26:09] <timmywil> perhaps that's the consistency issue
[12:26:22] <timmywil> carriage returns between elements
[12:26:44] <timmywil> but maybe I can get away with only removing \r
[12:26:59] <timmywil> need to find the failing test first
[12:33:09] <timmywil> hmm, no fails in IE8. let's see about IE7
[12:36:57] <timmywil> ugh, I miss my VMs
[12:38:25] <DaveMethvin> so what's going wrong with browserstack for you?
[12:38:39] <timmywil> just really slow
[12:38:49] <timmywil> and ie6 blacks out when I run the full suite
[12:39:30] <DaveMethvin> we've had probs with ie6 on and off, i just figured we'd reached its limit of stuff b/c the individual tests all run fine
[12:40:25] <timmywil> does this hang in IE6? http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/FjBeL/
[12:40:28] <timmywil> err
[12:40:30] <timmywil> not that
[12:40:41] <timmywil>  /jquery/test/?filter=ajax:%20.ajax()%20-%20retry
[12:40:49] <timmywil> that test
[12:40:59] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[12:41:34] <DaveMethvin> worksforme
[12:42:03] <timmywil> ok
[12:42:41] <DaveMethvin> also works in browserstack when i tunnel to my localhost
[12:42:59] <timmywil> yours is better then
[12:44:00] <DaveMethvin> oh interesting...I was using ie7 on bs, it DOES hang in ie6 on BS timmywil
[12:44:14] <timmywil> ah, cool I'm not crazy
[12:44:27] <DaveMethvin> remind me never to name my startup so it can be initialed BS
[12:44:35] <timmywil> hehe
[12:44:55] <timmywil> unless you really want to name it BullShit
[12:45:01] <DaveMethvin> i'll name my startup Software Testing Feature Updater
[12:45:03] <timmywil> in that case I support you
[12:45:14] <timmywil> lol
[12:45:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah...dunno why ie6 is hanging there
[12:45:55] <DaveMethvin> ie7 worked fine, and real ie6 in a vm works
[12:46:12] <timmywil> weird
[12:54:25] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: is this the intended behaviors? (looking at just chrome) http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/FjBeL/4/
[12:54:55] <timmywil> if you think of any more tests, add please
[13:00:03] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: that looks as right as oldIE can make it
[13:01:51] <timmywil> hmm, it seems this really only affects new lines between elements
[13:02:09] <timmywil> that first foo new line is not respected even after not removing carriage returns
[13:03:03] <DaveMethvin> it seems like IE likes to trim a lot of that before anything sees it, which means we can't bring it back
[13:03:45] <timmywil> right, looks like I'm not the only one removing new lines
[13:04:20] <DaveMethvin> blaming ie for removing newlines, kind of like blaming the dog for farting
[13:04:44] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ah, but I can still remove just /r and /n still works for foo2
[13:05:04] <timmywil> that should be slightly more consistent right?
[13:05:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think so, don't really need \r and \n
[13:05:45] <DaveMethvin> although, if there is just a \r in chrome for example, it stays
[13:06:12] <timmywil> but chrome won't use innerText so we're good there I think
[13:06:19] <DaveMethvin> ok
[13:09:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: heh, I suppose the ticket isn't really related to carriage returns
[13:10:27] <timmywil> oh wait, yes it is
[13:10:33] <timmywil> come on brain
[13:11:59] <DaveMethvin> i guess so, but oldIE is so diff about this that i can't imagine it's something anyone would depend on in general .. oh wait i can
[13:12:28] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if that is three text nodes
[13:12:29] <DaveMethvin> or one
[13:12:42] <DaveMethvin> and if that makes a differences
[13:14:17] <DaveMethvin> three, three text nodes
[13:16:23] <timmywil> ugh, this is an innerText issue
[13:16:32] <timmywil> it ain't my fault!
[13:18:31] <timmywil> alright, well we can consider going back to nodeValue if we want. It will still be slightly faster with the sibling traversal rather than the while loop
[13:18:38] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ^
[13:19:08] <DaveMethvin> i guess we'll have to
[13:19:19] <DaveMethvin> i don't know that it matters perf-wise
[13:19:20] <timmywil> hmm
[13:19:46] <timmywil> how about we just skip innerText and use textContent where available
[13:20:13] <timmywil> IE should still go back to nodeValue and uber browsers can use textContent
[13:20:21] <DaveMethvin> sounds good, at least if it works
[13:20:44] <timmywil> lemme check
[13:22:38] <timmywil> for the life of me, I don't know why I ever removed \n
[13:31:23] <timmywil> seems to work

[14:14:34] <DaveMethvin> good q timmywil
[14:14:49] <DaveMethvin> i have lost confidence in swarm as a testing mechanism for any timer-based stuff

[18:18:50] <mikesherov> .
[18:43:56] <mikesherov> danheberden: you here yet?
[18:57:52] <mikesherov> Hey DaveMethvin
[18:57:58] <DaveMethvin> hey
[18:58:03] <DaveMethvin> sup mikesherov
[18:58:09] <mikesherov> Not much
[18:58:16] <DaveMethvin> sometime that is good
[18:58:29] <mikesherov> Except I just realized that I may be sending laughinghan on a fools errand: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/719
[18:58:43] <mikesherov> I've given him like 30 comments on his pull request
[18:58:54] <mikesherov> And he's made every change
[18:59:12] <mikesherov> but it's an opera edge case
[18:59:50] <DaveMethvin> i wonder what the time frame is on an opera fix
[19:00:01] <mikesherov> but even still, we support Opera current -1
[19:00:18] <DaveMethvin> true, just depends on their pace
[19:00:27] <DaveMethvin> if 1.8 came out say at the end of june
[19:00:59] <DaveMethvin> then maybe we wouldn't need to fix it on our side
[19:01:36] <DaveMethvin> man you got that poor guy jumping through hooops :O
[19:01:51] <mikesherov> Well, I try to give everyone a fair shake
[19:01:55] <DaveMethvin> git merge --pity
[19:01:58] <mikesherov> but it may be a fool's errand
[19:02:14] <mikesherov> you know, I like to groom potential contributors
[19:02:18] <mikesherov> they remind me of me
[19:02:19] <DaveMethvin> well he gets a ton of points for that
[19:02:22] <DaveMethvin> i agree
[19:02:44] <DaveMethvin> lemme read thru this opus
[19:02:50] <DaveMethvin> what's the final size?
[19:03:18] <mikesherov> Well, what's interesting is that I got involved because initially this was going to prevent the removal of the old getOffset code
[19:03:33] <mikesherov> Rick pulled me in on pull request 717
[19:03:50] <mikesherov> and then this guy found a workaround that didn't require us to keep the old fallback
[19:04:03] <mikesherov> I haven't measured it yet because I wanted to see how small the final would be
[19:04:34] <mikesherov> I'm only know realizing what a mistake this is to give so many points of feedback
[19:04:50] <mikesherov> Let me get out my measuring stick
[19:05:25] <DaveMethvin> well i think it's a great exercise for him, even if we don't land it
[19:05:30] <mikesherov> yeah
[19:05:48] <mikesherov> I'll just keeping telling myself that :-P
[19:06:19] <DaveMethvin> and it seems like he's responding to your suggestions, so if we don't land this we shoudl give him something simple that's a sure-fire merge
[19:06:30] <mikesherov> yeah, for sure
[19:10:58] <mikesherov> oof, 181 bytes
[19:11:07] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[19:11:13] <mikesherov> SORRY
[19:11:15] <DaveMethvin> waaaaay too big
[19:11:18] <mikesherov> I didn't mean it
[19:11:24] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:11:55] <DaveMethvin> well sometimes you don't know until it's too late
[19:12:25] <mikesherov> I'm still learning
[19:12:48] <DaveMethvin> i have my own demons, don't sweat it
[19:12:53] <mikesherov> Sometimes you end up with a laughinghan situation, sometimes you discover tinymce is a duck-puncher
[19:12:58] <mikesherov> you win some, you lose some
[19:13:14] <DaveMethvin> sometimes you punch the duck, sometimes the duck punches you
[19:13:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah and btw thanks for finding that again ... amazing how nobody seemed to find that in the 6 weeks we had a beta
[19:14:00] <DaveMethvin> kinda bugs me
[19:14:05] <DaveMethvin> like, WHY HAVE A BETA
[19:14:19] <DaveMethvin> if nobody is gonna test their plugins
[19:14:32] <DaveMethvin> i run the ui and mobile suites before we release
[19:14:44] <DaveMethvin> but i cannot test every plugin, they need to do that
[19:15:02] <mikesherov> yeah
[19:15:13] <mikesherov> you know, no one wants to be an early adopter
[19:15:33] <mikesherov> so, how do I let laughinghan down easy now?
[19:15:44] <DaveMethvin> you want me to chime in?
[19:15:46] <mikesherov> are you going to swoop in and save me?
[19:15:48] <mikesherov> Sure
[19:15:54] <mikesherov> You're way better with words than me
[19:16:07] <DaveMethvin> np, I'll point to the 181 byte man and make funny faces
[19:16:29] <mikesherov> hahaha
[19:17:05] <mikesherov> I'll go fish for a ticket that we can give him to make up for it.
[19:18:02] <mikesherov> As long as it doesn't break backwards compat, so Rick's head doesn't explode
[19:52:30] <mikesherov> thanks Dave for saving me
[19:53:45] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I owe you one. One day I'll get the hang of this thing
[19:53:57] <DaveMethvin> np mikesherov
[19:54:05] <DaveMethvin> thanks for mentoring him
[19:54:10] <DaveMethvin> it's a tough job
[19:54:22] <mikesherov> Well, it helps me too.
[19:54:53] <DaveMethvin> as long as laughinghan is still laughing we're ok
[19:55:11] <mikesherov> And I'm just paying it forward for the guidance you guys gave me
[19:55:24] <mikesherov> Something like 4 out of my first 6 patches didn't land
[19:55:43] <DaveMethvin> see and look where you ended up
[19:55:46] <DaveMethvin> sucker
[19:56:01] <mikesherov> I keep telling my co-worker who submitted that PR that he'll be lucky to get it accepted
[19:56:11] <mikesherov> but that he should keep submitting
[19:56:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah don't let it get him down
[19:56:25] <DaveMethvin> there's a lot of learning
[19:56:50] <mikesherov> We're having another hackathon next week. I think I'm going to exercise some judgement and give him a better bug to fix.
[19:56:58] <mikesherov> Well, it's funny. He's not even an engineer
[19:57:25] <mikesherov> he's like our company's strategist, but he's got some programming skills
[19:57:47] <DaveMethvin> on the internet, nobody knows you're an engineer
[19:57:58] <mikesherov> so it's like our little hackathon project: get a non techie to be a contributor to the world's most widely used open source library
[19:58:36] <mikesherov> I'm trying to get our product manager, who's like on lesson 8 of code academy to contribute
[19:58:50] <DaveMethvin> hey you never know
[19:59:34] <mikesherov> honestly, with the large barrage of unit testing to help nudge you, and an 8 hour hackathon to do it in, I think almost anyone can write a bug fix
[20:00:28] <DaveMethvin> it's all the other things like style points and size that make it harder
[20:01:47] <mikesherov> yeah, for sure
[20:02:23] <mikesherov> it's like 5 things: correctness, size, speed, style, and maintainability
