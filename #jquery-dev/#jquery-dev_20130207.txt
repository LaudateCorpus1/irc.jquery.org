[08:00:43] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Hey! Does the jQuery foundation have some kind of arrangement with browserstack whereby I might be able to use it for more than the trial period (30 minutes)? I have already asked whether I can expense a year's subscription for myself, but I could use some access before that request goes through ...
[08:13:49] <miketaylr> _|Nix|_: did you see the 3 month free browserstack from MSFT? http://www.modern.ie/virtualization-tools
[08:18:00] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: yes, we do
[08:18:31] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: cc scott_gonzalez ^^^ can we get _|Nix|_ on our browserstack?
[08:19:04] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Which email address do you want to use?
[08:39:15] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: gabriel.schulhof@intel.com
[08:39:19] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Thanks!
[08:39:32] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: I'll resend the invite.
[08:39:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK. Thanks!
[08:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> sent
[08:40:26] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I've already signed up using that email address. Will that be a problem?
[08:42:12] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so. If it is, just let me know.
[08:54:42] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Awesome! Thanks 1e6! browserstack totally picked up the fact that I already had an account. I simply seem to have joined the jQuery team.
[08:56:54] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[08:58:12] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: You should have essentially unlimited usage.
[08:58:24] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: _|Nix|_ http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3sw54k/
[08:58:27] <scott_gonzalez> There is an actual limit on the API usage, but we'll never hit it.
[08:58:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: lol
[08:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is there any info/data format you've ever wished you could get when using git?
[09:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on a node module to build useful tools on top of git.
[09:02:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: our commit logs
[09:02:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: "my commits last month" report
[09:03:12] <gnarf> but like
[09:03:24] <gnarf> most of that stuff is just some esoteric combination of git log formats 
[09:03:36] <gnarf> and i've done most of it on my own
[09:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that one used to seem really tricky to me, and for a while I did some crazy stuff.
[09:04:32] <scott_gonzalez> But I've sinced realized it's actually a very simple command.
[09:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> git log --since="2013-01-01" --author="scott.gonzalez@gmail.com"
[09:05:33] <gnarf> yeah
[09:06:03] <gnarf> i think we figured that one out together one day, with --since and --before
[09:06:10] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:08:23] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: :)
[10:04:10] <gnarf> .seen maxmoore14
[10:04:10] <b-ot> gnarf: I saw maxmoore14 1m 35s, in #jquery, saying: gnarf: oh! here's something I've been curious about... I changed my widgets to use the new _on method for setting handlers. Does _off get called automatically by _destroy or do I have to call it explicitly?
[10:04:14] <gnarf> @scott_gonzalez  ^^^
[10:04:18] <gnarf> what were the rules there?
[10:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> automatic
[10:09:05] <gnarf> wasn't there a caveat if you put the event on an element outside?
[10:09:08] <gnarf> or is that automatic now too
[10:10:06] <gnarf> not sure why i didn't ask in ui-dev
[10:10:10] <gnarf> sorry core team! )
[10:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> Anything that goes through ._on() is automatically removed.
[10:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> You're probably thinking of the problem with multiple instances binding to the same element outside of the widget.
[10:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> And then destroying one would remove both handlers.
[10:12:46] <gnarf> fixed?
[10:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> That's fixed with the uuid that's used for ._on() now.
[10:12:54] <gnarf> yay

[11:36:34] <rwaldron> ajpiano sorry dawg, that's not necessarily true...
[11:36:42] <rwaldron> eg. Safari
[11:37:27] <rwaldron> current stable release might be 5.1 and the previous stable release was 5.0.1 (this actually happens)
[11:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, Same for Opera.
[11:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> Opera is even more confusing because they don't use 3 part version numbers :-/

[12:48:00] <gibson042> I must've hallucinated using it before :)
[12:48:11] <DaveMethvin> maybe Opera  took it out because nobody used it
[13:09:49] <gibson042> and Safari's all: Refused to load script from "http://swarm.jquery.org/build/jquery/.../test/data/support/csp.js" because of Content-Security-Policy
[13:43:36] <gnarf> or maybe document isn't a document... dun dun dun!
