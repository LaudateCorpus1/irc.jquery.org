[06:06:11] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: sorry, i thought i had talked about putting migrate on the cdn. it doesn't HAVE to be there, it's more likely to be used as a debugging tool (i hope) than a long-term crutch
[06:06:36] <DaveMethvin> microsoft has it up on their cdn
[06:07:09] <DaveMethvin> this is the point where your mom says "if microsoft jumped off a cliff, would google do it too?"
[06:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> Google would just buy an existing jumping off the bridge company and then not worry if it dies when it jumps.
[07:24:22] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez pfftt hahaha
[08:50:11] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: W3C wants us to write a blog post about Pointer Events in jQuery.
[08:50:37] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: what do they want us to say?
[08:50:39] <DaveMethvin> :D
[08:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> They want us to write about our plans.
[08:51:19] <DaveMethvin> the ultimate goal would be to have everyone using pointer events exclusively, right?
[08:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:51:38] <DaveMethvin> so we should talk about how much of a mess we want to make in between
[08:51:49] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez: didn't you already write a really great blog post?
[08:52:05] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Yeah, about how much Touch Events suck.
[08:52:06] <DaveMethvin> this is more about the future though
[08:52:21] <scott_gonzalez> And it had a call to action for MS to submit a proposal to standardize Pointer Events.
[08:52:27] <rwaldron> I thought you also talked about PointerEvents being awesome
[08:52:31] * rwaldron shrugs
[08:52:31] <b-ot> rwaldron: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[08:52:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I did.
[08:52:39] <rwaldron> oh right... got it.
[08:52:49] <rwaldron> ...crossed the streams
[08:52:49] <DaveMethvin> so the next step is for someone to write a plugin that takes all the mouse/touch events and create pointer events
[08:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> Now we want to talk about how we plan on baking in support in jQuery since PE is so much better.
[08:53:34] <DaveMethvin> but that plugin will get exponentially harder if we have to support touch+mouse+pointer and define the semantics of using them all at once
[08:53:35] <scott_gonzalez> We want to encourage people to stop using mouse and touch ASAP.
[08:54:38] <DaveMethvin> conversely, nobody will give a crap about a plugin that is trying to make them completely redo the way they interact with pointers and prevents them from using existing plugins
[08:54:45] <DaveMethvin> and it won't be used
[08:55:52] <scott_gonzalez> So, they want this blog post out within a week :-)
[08:56:03] <scott_gonzalez> They want to be able to mention it at W3Conf
[08:56:22] <DaveMethvin> okay, so is this something our team is supposed to write?
[08:56:32] <DaveMethvin> our being the jquery teams in aggregate
[08:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:57:50] <DaveMethvin> well if we just need to fulfill the spirit of the law we just create that pointer events layer ... i haven't looked to see how nice a facade we can create from existing mouse/touch events
[08:58:27] <DaveMethvin> i didn't look at the one that dfreedman wrote in much detail, maybe we can adopt that one
[08:58:43] <DaveMethvin> it didn't support oldie
[08:58:59] <DaveMethvin> but i have to wonder whether the people who'd want to be that progressive would care
[08:59:51] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/toolkitchen/PointerEvents
[08:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, for oldie, we only need to map mouse -> pointer.
[09:00:01] <scott_gonzalez> And that's simple because they're nearly identical.
[09:00:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah but we'd need to add attachEvent and handle the funny non-std event object etc
[09:02:04] <DaveMethvin> wow that code already has shadow root support
[09:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> wow
[09:02:59] <scott_gonzalez> So, even with this, we'd need oldie support.
[09:03:19] <DaveMethvin> let's cross that bridge later
[09:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling all of these existing polyfills will be much larger than our own special events implementation.
[09:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> But it would be nice to just leverage some existing code.
[10:56:31] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez: fwiw we seem to be moving in that direction too. author to pointer events.
[10:57:11] <DaveMethvin> i just wonder if we can get people to write ONLY to pointer events and avoid the nightmares caused by mixing
[10:58:14] <paul_irish> https://github.com/toolkitchen/PointerEvents
[10:58:57] <paul_irish> this is some folks on the Chrome team
[10:58:58] <paul_irish> it's good
[11:04:33] <paul_irish> DaveMethvin: so
[11:04:37] <paul_irish> migrate script
[11:05:01] <paul_irish> makes sense to me to have it on one CDN for improve cache hit possibility
[11:05:12] <paul_irish> dont think so?
[11:05:40] <DaveMethvin> i'd put it on the CDN just to shut people up, if for no other reason :D
[11:05:55] <rwaldron> +1
[11:06:21] <DaveMethvin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13391#comment:1
[11:07:06] <DaveMethvin> that's always been tricky, if I don't update the cdn links then i have to leave them at 1.9.0 and then i don't always know when 1.9.1 appears
[11:07:24] <DaveMethvin> perhaps i should just point to the google/ms pages and be done with it
[11:07:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's what I'll do

[11:13:42] <DaveMethvin> i feel like `git push --tabs` should do something interesting
[11:13:53] <DaveMethvin> but git disagrees
[11:25:22] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> It should rewrite history for all commits that uses spaces and then do a force push.
[12:12:56] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone else ever have `git push` just hang indefinitely?
[12:13:17] <scott_gonzalez> I randomly have git just sit there.
[12:13:27] <scott_gonzalez> I don't even get the "Counting object..." line.
[12:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> But then if I ctrl+c and try again, it goes immediately.

[13:09:31] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez: yes, I've seen that several times in the past month
[13:09:42] <rwaldron> same result
[13:09:53] <rwaldron> git push ... newline, then nothing?
[13:09:57] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:10:02] <rwaldron> control+c and retry, works fine
[13:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:10:06] <rwaldron> strange
[13:10:43] <rwaldron> I wonder if it coincides with a git update
[13:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> The only possible explanation I've found so far is SSH connection sharing.
[13:10:49] <rwaldron> oh maybe
[13:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I just ran `ssh -v git@github.com` several times and then it stalled.
[13:13:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna try turning this off.
[13:15:39] <scott_gonzalez> I don't seem to have anything in my config about this.
[13:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> My global config is actually quite small:
[13:16:01] <scott_gonzalez>  Host *
[13:16:01] <scott_gonzalez>    SendEnv LANG LC_*
[13:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> And I don't have a local config.
[13:17:13] <gf3> Might just be a bad connection?
[13:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> could be
[13:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> `ssh -v git@github.com` hangs right before "debug1: Remote protocol version 2.0, remote software version OpenSSH_5.5p1 Debian-6+squeeze1+github8"
[13:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> So maybe GitHub's servers aren't responding on occasion.
[13:25:25] <gf3> Maybe it's preferential treatment? Gotta grease a few palmsâ€¦
