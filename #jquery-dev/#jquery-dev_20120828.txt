[06:22:17] <bot-t> (13 hours 40 mins ago) <johnbender> tell DaveMethvin I wanted to double check that his is a valid selector before submitting the exception it generates as a bug (jquery-git) http://jsbin.com/uvoxay/1/edit - check the console for the exception
[06:24:07] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: re that selector, yes it's valid and it shoudl work now

[08:39:28] <DaveMethvin> how the heck did that happen timmywil
[08:41:25] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I'm guessing you ran authors and committing without updating submodules. no biggie
[08:41:32] <timmywil> *committed
[08:42:57] <timmywil> I giggled
[08:45:58] <mikesherov> .
[08:52:27] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[08:53:57] <ryanneufeld> ?tell gnarf we should find a time to chat about the VMS for the hackathon
[08:53:58] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Okay.
[09:01:24] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: yeah that was it, i edited authors.txt and didn't run grunt since i wasn't building source :/
[09:40:39] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: out of curiousity, 1.8.1 is happening this week yes?
[09:40:53] <DaveMethvin> i hope so ajpiano ...
[09:40:59] <ajpiano> ok, someone asked
[09:41:22] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: there are still a few selector tix on the blockers list, are you working on those?
[09:41:31] <DaveMethvin> (When you're not fixing my reverts)
[09:42:33] <gibson042> DaveMethvin I've got at least one
[09:43:21] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks gibson042
[10:13:11] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: thanks!
[10:13:39] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: building against jquery-git now
[10:13:43] <johnbender> "building"
[10:17:41] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I've got the other one
[10:17:53] <timmywil> I can do it tonight
[10:17:59] <timmywil> need to work on work stuff now
[10:21:30] <gibson042> same here
[10:30:59] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: when you said "should work now" did you mean "should work nowish" ?
[10:31:28] <DaveMethvin> the jquery-git we have is the best we have
[10:31:39] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: that selector is breaking?
[10:31:41] <DaveMethvin> what was it again?
[10:31:48] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: http://jsbin.com/uvoxay/1/edit
[10:32:30] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[10:32:39] <DaveMethvin> i just tried it when i posted above and no error
[10:33:15] <DaveMethvin> (9:24:07 AM) DaveMethvin: johnbender: re that selector, yes it's valid and it shoudl work now
[10:33:30] <DaveMethvin> of course I reverted something by accident, maybe that fixed it
[10:33:55] <DaveMethvin> let me see when that was
[10:35:06] <DaveMethvin> yeah that seems like it may have been what happened
[10:36:11] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: maybe I just have a caching issue?
[10:36:12] <DaveMethvin> i accidentially reverted sizzle around 9am, tested that around 9:20am
[10:36:39] <DaveMethvin> so it seems like this is a recent regression
[10:36:45] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: it is
[10:36:50] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: it was a few days ago
[10:41:15] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: it would be nice to record the git version of jquery-git when we run that build
[10:41:25] <johnbender> so at least you have a place to start a bisect
[10:41:34] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: it has the commit hash in the header
[10:41:52] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: yah I was thinking I could curl and grep
[10:42:06] * johnbender goes to futz with that
[10:42:18] <DaveMethvin> jQuery JavaScript Library v1.8.1pre 7d076f5d79e2193e4399e78403f315db17206910
[10:46:29] <ryanneufeld> filament group guys getting a lot of love in this env for humans preso
[10:58:19] <timmywil> johnbender, DaveMethvin; that's a bug, sorry about that!
[10:59:06] <timmywil> fixed four bugs with pseudo arguments. apparently chaining with attributes was lost
[10:59:18] <johnbender> timmywil: np np, the build is there to be broken
[10:59:33] <timmywil> well, I'll work on that tonight as well
[10:59:35] <johnbender> luckily we're finally being less useless to the core project :P
[10:59:35] <DaveMethvin> or at least slapped around a bit for its own good
[11:00:14] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: ok, I've got the commit output into the build
[11:00:33] <DaveMethvin> thanks for testing johnbender, we'll try to get this all fixed

[11:10:09] <timmywil> johnbender, DaveMethvin: think I already have a fix
[11:10:52] <DaveMethvin> don't make it look so easy timmywil, set up a cron job to commit it at 2am
[11:11:07] <timmywil> heh
[11:23:51] <timmywil> actually, I'm debating two solutions. i'll look more later
[11:57:55] <ajpiano> gnarf: there isn't a staging env set up on that web-events thing, is therE?
[11:58:12] <ajpiano> there sort of is
[13:29:37] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I think i'm supposed to be helping gnarf w/ that one. Not sure though
[13:38:39] <gnarf> ajpiano: um no
[13:38:39] <bot-t> (4 hours 44 mins ago) <ryanneufeld> tell gnarf we should find a time to chat about the VMS for the hackathon

[13:41:12] <ajpiano> we'll do what we can
[13:44:50] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: can we chat tonight regarding https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/68 Just want to make sure I'm on the right path here
[13:45:30] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: aye
[13:45:59] <ryanneufeld> k, what time zone you in? I have 13:45 here
[13:46:05] <gnarf> I'm central
[13:46:20] <gnarf> so +2

[14:31:23] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: act 2 or 3?
[14:31:25] <ryanneufeld> lol
[14:33:45] <DaveMethvin> dear swarmy: just because YOU hung up in ajax during the chrome 19 test, don't call me a FAILURE
[15:27:08] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/timmywil/sizzle/compare/master...12412
[15:27:42] <timmywil> I don't know if that makes sense. I went through my performance tests again and it still seems good.
[15:28:13] <timmywil> I was originally trying to avoid a conditional argument in tokenize
[15:28:57] <timmywil> it seems unavoidable, unless you have an idea
[15:29:19] <timmywil> I'll tell you though, we have the most complex parser of any selector engine
[15:29:27] <timmywil> hands down
[15:30:19] <timmywil> mostly because our needs are more complex. nwmatcher couldn't handle all our selectors.
[15:34:52] <timmywil> that is, nwmatcher and dojo can validate w3c selectors very well, but they don't have the infrastructure to do complex pseudos or POS correctly
[15:35:35] <timmywil> and when I say complex, it's actually pretty simple compared to trying to cover up context-free grammars with regex
[15:35:36] <timmywil> anyway
[15:35:45] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: where you at? I'm rambling
[15:56:07] <DaveMethvin> haha timmywil i'm here but i have to go walk the dog ... i'll take a look later
