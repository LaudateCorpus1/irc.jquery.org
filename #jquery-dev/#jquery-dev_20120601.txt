[08:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: If I have a list of SHAs in stdin, how can I pass each one to `git log -1 <sha>`?
[08:26:49] <scott_gonzalez> I tried ` | xargs git log -1` but that only showed one of them (and seemed to be from the middle of the list.
[08:28:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: man xargs, there is a command line option to define how many of the args to pass
[08:28:44] <gnarf> its prolly passing all the sha's as arguments

[08:30:26] <danheberden> "no need to dashsherovize..."
[08:30:47] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, `xargs -L 1 git log -1`
[08:31:45] <DaveMethvin> dasherize is a perfectly cromulent word imo
[08:32:52] <danheberden> heh

[16:47:19] <Dvir> hello. Is the automatic casting of numeric data- attributes value into integers justified? It causes data loss on numbers larger than 10^17. (test in chrome) - http://jsfiddle.net/dvirazulay/kfWPL/ - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/806

[17:09:46] <danzik17> Dvir: there's a pretty long thread on the bugtracker: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7579
[17:09:50] <shoky> :)
[17:12:44] <Dvir> oh!
[17:13:02] <Dvir> somehow it didn't come up on my searchs
[17:16:36] <Dvir> meh. wontfix? .data became obsolete for me right now...
[17:19:26] <Dvir> correct me if I'm wrong, .data uses caching, but .attr doesn't?
