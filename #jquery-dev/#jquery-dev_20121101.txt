[10:10:36] <Krinkle> ben_alman: Hey there
[10:10:45] <ben_alman> yo
[10:13:22] <Krinkle> ben_alman: I'm looking to convert MediaWiki's Jenkins build process into grunt instead of ant-xml. But there's a few things we need that I'm seeing but not sure in what state they are.
[10:13:34] <Krinkle> ben_alman: one of those things is jshint with .jshintignore used.
[10:13:46] <Krinkle> ben_alman: I see there is groundwork being done in the 0.4 version of grunt-jshint
[10:13:58] <Krinkle> but would you say 0.4 is ready for production yet?
[10:14:08] <ben_alman> we're going to try to release it in the week
[10:14:11] <ben_alman> working on docs today
[10:14:17] <Krinkle> i.e. better than 0.3 or a rerite still in progress?
[10:14:52] <Krinkle> I was thinking implementing in in grunt-jshint if we can use 0.4 (instead of trying to hack it in a fork of 0.3)
[10:15:02] <ben_alman> 0.4 will be out very soon.
[10:15:19] <Krinkle> we also need csslint and phplint, I see jzaefferer worked on csslint already, and phplint I can do myself if needed (fairly simple to implement).
[10:15:24] <Krinkle> ben_alman: nice
[10:15:55] <Krinkle> There is a sprint in the netherlands next week, I'll use 0.4 then. A few weeks from now when it would be used in production, by that time 0.4 will be released.
[10:39:19] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: let me know if you need something for grunt-css; it should work with 0.4 (no helpers anymore!), but I haven't actually tested it
[10:39:55] <Krinkle> If it can do what node-csslint can do and set options, then I'm good.
[10:41:02] <Krinkle> ben_alman: Regarding implementation of jshintignore, although csslint doesn't have such standard file, I imagine we'll need it there as well. Perhaps we can add a grunt.file utility for subtracting a pattern from an existing array of patterns?
[10:41:24] <Krinkle> like expandFiles(array of incl-patterns, array of excl-patterns)
[10:41:41] <Krinkle> for jshint we can just read the jshintignore file, and for csslint it could be a simple config option
[10:42:05] <Krinkle> I believe you mentioned something like this already, not sure if it was you.
[10:52:29] <gnarf> hey speakers - any tips on a code-highlighting solution to use, or should I just copy/paste as html from textmate like I did last time :)
[10:52:51] <gnarf> these plain color code blocks are starting look annoying to me
[10:56:31] <tj_vantoll> gnarf I use Google's prettify http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/.  I've been meaning to try Prism but haven't got around to it yet http://lea.verou.me/2012/07/introducing-prism-an-awesome-new-syntax-highlighter/.
[11:05:13] <_|Nix|_> Hi! Could somebody please unmoderate #jquery-meeting for the jQM meeting?
[11:59:54] <jqcommit> [testswarm] Krinkle pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/3hdn1A
[11:59:54] <jqcommit> testswarm/master ee8dc59 Patrick Kettner: Add "Reset failed jobs" button. Fixes #222. Closes #235....
[12:27:58] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: How do you feel about updating all qunit docs and examples to use the context pattern (assert)
[12:32:08] <gnarf> RWhitbeck kborchers danheberden - any of you dig up browser usage stats for south korea yet? I'm trying to find a nice chart
[12:32:42] <kborchers> i have not
[12:32:49] <RWhitbeck> just mobile stats
[12:35:36] <gnarf> https://secure.getclicky.com/marketshare/kr/web-browsers/
[12:37:37] <gnarf> looks like chrome is on the serious rise over there
[12:37:43] <gnarf> but IE is still by far the incumbent
[12:37:44] <gnarf> :)
[12:43:16] <kborchers> gnarf: a much different view http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser-KR-monthly-201110-201210
[12:45:30] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I'd have to start using that myself (first). Implementing the async-assert-verification would be a big motivator for that.
[12:45:46] <gnarf> nice kborchers
[12:46:18] <gnarf> the downside of things like clicky is they only work on the sites they monitor which probably don't have enough market share to really detect usage in some of those countries
[12:50:24] <clarkbox> its too bad google doesn't make aggregate stats collected via analytics public
[12:52:15] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: k
[12:52:49] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, I noticed that node-assert and node-tap also use the context pattern
[12:53:01] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: tap has a .end() method on the assertion object
[12:53:19] <Krinkle> I'm not sure I like the requirement to call that all the time (even with sync tests)
[12:53:29] <Krinkle> maybe utilise expect for this?
[12:53:53] <Krinkle> (of course expect, stop and start would become a context-method as well,  not just assertions)
[12:55:01] <Krinkle> I'm thinking a TestContext that contains .expect, .start and .stop and have its prototype inherit from Assert
[12:55:29] <Krinkle> anyhow, right now my priority is on getting ua-parser working
[12:55:50] <Krinkle> Garry said he is looking to kill browscap by the end of the year, but I see the domain is already dead (could be a coincedence)
[13:26:39] <jzaefferer> Krinkle|detached: alright, thanks for the input. I should get back to QUnit in the next few days. If the context-specific methods work out, I'm all for promoting usage of them.

[15:34:13] <Krinkle> Hm.. do we want people to run $.makeArray first on jQuery objects given to jQuery.map ?
[15:34:50] <Krinkle> It does require true arrays (looks like it doesn't like fake arrays like arguments), but has an exception for jQuery objects.
[15:35:52] <Krinkle> docs issue? or undocumented feature?
[15:37:27] <snover> DaveMethvin: to our discussion about errors and ajax, an error is likeâ€¦network error, network timeout, truncated response, etc.; no matter what error code the http server responds with, as long as it responds and the response is complete, it should be considered a success
[16:08:32] <DaveMethvin> snover: right, i think that's what Promise may have intended but that's not what jQuery implements so we have to figure out where to go from here...

[18:36:28] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by Dave Methvin (59m, 21s ago): Follow-up for .selector property removal
[18:36:33] <Krinkle> This broke 300+ effects tests in all browsers.
[18:36:50] <Krinkle> did you atleast run it locally in chrome or some other unicorn browser?
[18:37:04] <DaveMethvin> huh
[18:37:08] <Krinkle> there are no minor changes with jQuery :P
[18:37:29] <Krinkle> and 5 in core
[18:37:49] <DaveMethvin> it's not failing anything in core for me
[18:38:06] <DaveMethvin> but i'm running a full test locally
[18:38:06] <Krinkle> jQuery(jQueryObj) == jQueryObj
[18:38:14] <Krinkle> Expected:	
[18:38:14] <Krinkle> "div"
