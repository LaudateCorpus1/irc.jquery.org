[00:06:35] <sac> i suppose that might be a bug, but i'll wait for an answer
[00:06:49] <sac> i just don't like fixing my code to fix it again after the bug is fixed
[00:07:18] <sac> or maybe i'll just do if event.type === 'mouseenter' || event.type === 'mouseover'
[00:48:46] <int3__> Hi! I'm thinking of getting involved in jquery, and so I took a look at the bug tracker. I'd like to ask -- what's the difference between 'assigned' and 'open' bugs? Does 'assigned' mean that someone is already on the way to implementing a solution?
[04:55:53] <jaubourg> hi there
[05:48:34] <Jakey> .outerHeight() doesn't work anyjore
[05:48:37] <Jakey> any workarounds
[05:48:38] <Jakey> or fix
[06:18:01] <kswedberg> Jakey: do you have a reduced test case, preferably at jsfiddle.net?
[06:22:48] <Jakey> just do this
[06:23:00] <Jakey> $(window).outerHeiht()]
[06:23:02] <Jakey> $(window).outerHeiht()
[06:23:04] <Jakey> $(window).outerHeiht(true)
[06:23:10] <Jakey> those two
[06:23:18] <Jakey> jquery 1.5.1
[06:23:57] <Jakey> can't believe every jquery upgrade( new version come out) it breaks compability
[06:26:31] <jqp> how would i change the 'component' for this bug: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9324?  it should be 'ajax'
[06:33:39] <kswedberg> Jakey: from http://api.jquery.com/outerheight/: "This method is not applicable to window and document objects; for these, use http://api.jquery.com/height instead."
[06:34:22] <Jakey> that function doesn't give the right value
[06:34:37] <Jakey> only gives innerheight
[06:34:42] <Jakey> or what ever
[06:34:50] <Jakey> but i guess you just have to live with it
[06:40:59] <kswedberg> Jakey: have you tried window.outerHeight ? Not sure if it's available in IE, but it at least works in gecko and webkit browsers. seems like it would make a lot more sense to simply access the property directly off the window object anyway.
[06:47:01] <Jakey> yes only for ff
[06:47:08] <Jakey> its not crossbrowser
[07:06:11] <rwaldron> wow
[07:06:17] <rwaldron> docs#9323
[07:06:19] <bot-t> [#9323]  (closed bug: wontfix) - http://jqbug.com/9323
[07:16:43] <JohnResig> it seems like they want .prop
[07:18:44] <Jakey> well well well, the devil speaks :)
[07:19:07] <ajpiano> rwaldron: i don't understand how things like that somehow escalate so much
[07:19:08] <ajpiano> :/
[07:19:49] <rwaldron> i thought i was being fun
[07:19:52] <ajpiano> well i mean i sort of do
[07:19:53] <rwaldron> with history
[07:19:55] <ajpiano> it's the word "you"
[07:20:11] * rwaldron is intrigued...
[07:20:35] <ajpiano> " What is the real reason you'd like to use width/height attributes to control the presentational style of your image?"
[07:20:46] <ajpiano> ". I was on StackOverflow taking part in helping a user of your library understand why a feature didn't work as expected."
[07:20:47] <ajpiano> etc
[07:21:16] <timmywil> you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you
[07:21:41] <timmywil> no u
[07:22:59] <ajpiano> rwaldron: he thought he was being a benevolent opensource helper-outer, boldly escalating an issue from SO to the proper venue
[07:23:24] <ajpiano> and then he thought you were being like, "hey idiot, why did YOU want to do this STUPID thing"
[07:24:12] <timmywil> I didn't read it that way
[07:24:17] <rwaldron> jesus
[07:24:19] <rwaldron> :\
[07:24:22] <ajpiano> yeah i think he was being super touchy
[07:24:50] <rwaldron> i find your assessment of the word "you" to be very interesting
[07:24:53] <rwaldron> and i support it
[07:25:01] <ajpiano> but it's part of why i tend to stick with locutions like "the team" or "we" or "the OP" etc.
[07:25:13] <rwaldron> accept that i wasnt taking "user of your library understand wh..." like it was actually about me
[07:25:17] <rwaldron> but i get it
[07:25:43] <ajpiano> still, closing your trac account in protest
[07:25:57] <ajpiano> is like, kind of ... melodramatic
[07:36:06] <kswedberg> fwiw, I agree the OP was touchy — but, rwaldron, you gotta admit your narrative retelling of the spec discussion followed by "So enlighten me…" was kinda snarky.
[07:36:25] <ajpiano> ya
[07:36:56] <ajpiano> kinda inadvertent
[07:37:18] <rwaldron> when i wrote it, i was honestly being fun
[07:37:22] <rwaldron> or thought i was being so
[07:37:24] <ajpiano> i know
[07:37:25] <rwaldron> it seemed fun
[07:37:29] <rwaldron> history!
[07:37:49] <ajpiano> fun has a hard way of translating onto trac
[07:38:28] <kswedberg> sure. and I'm not trying to rain down judgment on you. but I think it helps to know how such things can be perceived.
[07:40:17] <timmywil> I didn't see it as snarky either, but maybe those who know you better know better
[07:40:55] <ajpiano> yeah exactly.  all of us know how you meant it
[07:41:14] <kswedberg> cuz we all know you as the fun-loving guy that you are. :)
[07:41:26] <jaubourg> ...
[07:41:29] <jaubourg> hi
[07:41:35] <ajpiano> but it's not exactly hard to read the comment as "hey dumbass, let's go look at a 14 year old document that shows how dumb of an ass you are"
[07:41:36] <ajpiano> :p
[07:41:36] <timmywil> lol, nice timing jaubourg
[07:41:55] * ajpiano sorry for harping
[07:42:04] <jaubourg> what are we talking about? (curious mode on)
[07:42:18] <timmywil> trac dramas
[07:42:21] <jaubourg> also, I'll need a design for an ajaxHooks site
[07:42:28] <jaubourg> and I suck at this
[07:42:38] <ajpiano> get gf3 or darcyclarke to do it :p
[07:42:48] <gf3> holla
[07:42:53] <jaubourg> hey gf3 :)
[07:43:27] <rwaldron> jaubourg i wanted to show you a ticket i closed lst night
[07:43:29] <kswedberg> ajpiano: yeah, that's what I was thinking, too. rwaldron: I actually feel really mellow about it. don't want you to feel ganged up on or anything. just making some observations
[07:43:31] <rwaldron> thought you'd be proud
[07:43:48] <rwaldron> jaubourg docs#9320
[07:43:50] <jaubourg> link away rick
[07:43:50] <bot-t> [#9320] Load multiple scripts with $.getScript (closed enhancement: wontfix) - http://jqbug.com/9320
[07:43:56] <rwaldron> :D
[07:44:06] <rwaldron> dig that DUCKPUNCH
[07:44:44] <jaubourg> nice
[07:45:11] <jaubourg> gf3: do you think you'd have time to look into making some fancy design for the ajaxHooks project?
[07:45:33] <gf3> sure, but it might take me some time
[07:45:34] <rwaldron> "ajaxHooks"? :(
[07:45:39] <gf3> how fast/soon do you need it?
[07:45:46] <rwaldron> jQuery.hooks.ajax! WOO!
[07:45:54] <jaubourg> https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks
[07:46:23] <jaubourg> gf3: at your leisure, really, but I'd need the html structure pretty soon so that I can make an unstyled version soon ;)
[07:46:48] <gf3> jaubourg: just for content?
[07:47:02] <jaubourg> problem is I: 1) suck at design 2) need to work on prefilters to add to the hooks
[07:47:17] <jaubourg> gf3: yes content, I have a custom builder php script
[07:47:26] <gf3> jaubourg: well why don't you write the stuff in markdown, and I'll work around that w/ the design? ")
[07:47:40] <jaubourg> but that's basically a list of checkboxes and a dynamically generated link
[07:48:12] <jaubourg> gf3: I dunno, I thought about writing it in html and put the site in the repo
[07:48:31] <jaubourg> (mainly one big page I'd expect)
[07:48:44] <jaubourg> I'd like to add docs for each hook but I have no clue how to proceed with that
[07:49:01] <jaubourg> whatever you think is simpler, just let me know
[07:49:06] <gf3> jaubourg: markdown would be perfect for that!
[07:49:16] <jaubourg> for docs, yes
[07:49:21] <gf3> that way you could have a repo of purely docs
[07:49:28] <gf3> and then maybe design shell around it
[07:49:40] <jaubourg> but I have this custom builder to add too
[07:49:40] <gf3> so you could easily export to html/text/etc...
[07:49:47] <jaubourg> let me just commit the thing so that you can see
[07:49:50] <gf3> what do you mean by custom builder?
[07:50:10] <jaubourg> gf3: select the hook, click a link, get a custom build with just the hooks you need
[07:50:49] <gf3> jaubourg: oh neat
[07:50:55] <gf3> jaubourg: let's do it in javascript!
[07:50:57] <gf3> :D
[07:51:03] <jaubourg> it's in php for now
[07:51:04] <jaubourg> :/
[07:51:27] <gf3> just launched http://ot-crew.com using express js :D
[07:52:02] <jaubourg> express js?
[07:52:46] <jaubourg> k, looking at it after a google search ;)
[08:01:49] <jaubourg> big advantage of being in nodejs would be to be able to output a minified version using uglifyjs

[14:08:08] <skamikaze> as jquery moved to doublequotes only would someone please recheck that "half a benchmark" please? i got a strange performance difference in chromium when using double quotes: http://jsfiddle.net/5HhWF/1/
[14:08:54] <skamikaze> single quotes are kind of 6 times faster for me in chromium 13.0.769.0
[14:12:39] <eddiemonge> use something like jsperf.com to test it
[14:12:59] <skamikaze> mhm kk
[14:17:25] <skamikaze> http://jsperf.com/single-vs-double-quote/3 => kind of same results
[14:19:26] <ajpiano> i'm not sure what this is meant to prove
[14:21:09] <ajpiano> because chrome is infinitessimally faster with single quotes than double quotes over millions of iterations, it was a bad idea to use double quotes?
[14:21:24] <skamikaze> it was just a "for your information"
[14:21:41] <skamikaze> i stumbled over the jsfiddle and got strange results
[14:22:02] <eddiemonge> its because you cant reliably use time to profile that way
[14:22:07] <skamikaze> and if single quotes would have been 6 times faster why not use single quotes then? :)
[14:22:13] <eddiemonge> whoa i just got infinity ops/sec
[14:22:13] <bot-t> (117 hours ago) <StevenBlack> tell eddiemonge: just tested a `make` and the timestamp comment works perfectly.
[14:22:20] <ajpiano> it's definitely not 6 times faster
[14:22:27] <ajpiano> it's 1-2% faster
[14:22:35] <skamikaze> yeah it's not i rechecked on jsperf
[14:23:51] <ajpiano> http://jsperf.com/single-vs-double-quote/4
[14:24:01] <ajpiano> the difference is not statistically significant from what i can tell
[14:25:18] <skamikaze> thought the same till i stumbled over that jsfiddle
[14:25:23] <skamikaze> well my fault - sry
[14:25:38] <eddiemonge> thats why i suggested jsperf, so you get a better picture of what was going on
[15:05:19] <gnarf> nice... infinity ops/sec ;)
[15:16:55] <gnarf> man, ie8 dev tools are a bitch to work with
[15:17:56] <Jakey> gnarf
[15:18:01] <Jakey> you seem familiar
[15:20:00] <gnarf> dunno where from...
[15:21:07] <Jakey> i'v seen this gnarf use lots of place
[15:21:26] <gnarf> sadly, my nick is not unique ;)
[15:21:48] <eddiemonge>   /nick gnarf13
[15:24:26] <Jakey> lol eddiemonge
[15:26:42] <Jakey> no gnarf
[15:26:46] <Jakey> its gnarly
