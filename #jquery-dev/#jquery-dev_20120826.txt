[06:18:29] <jaubourg> hi there
[06:35:11] <DaveMethvin> .
[06:35:12] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[06:35:12] <bot-t> (38 hours 40 mins ago) <johnbender> tell DaveMethvin some of our selector expressions broke
[06:35:12] <bot-t> (38 hours 40 mins ago) <johnbender> tell DaveMethvin Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [data-nstest-role=list-divider]):not(:hidden
[06:35:12] <bot-t> (38 hours 40 mins ago) <johnbender> tell DaveMethvin in the mobile jquery-git build that is
[06:35:12] <bot-t> (38 hours 40 mins ago) <johnbender> tell DaveMethvin I'll take a closer look in the morning
[06:35:12] <bot-t> (22 hours 30 mins ago) <mikesherov> tell DaveMethvin that I need confirm from Todd Parker that the Android 2.1 problem is resolved in git: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12370
[06:35:38] <DaveMethvin> b-ot: read
[06:35:39] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, from mikesherov, 22h 39m ago: that I need confirm from Todd Parker that the Android 2.1 problem is resolved in git: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12370
[06:36:48] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: try with jquery-git.js, i think timmywil fixed that yesterday
[16:01:45] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: the that's what the build runs with
[17:29:10] <DaveMethvin> .
[17:31:35] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ping
[17:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I tried to download jQuery, but all I got was a JavaScript file!
[17:32:45] <DaveMethvin> GAAAH! scott_gonzalez i really do think the bug reports are getting worse
[17:33:01] <scott_gonzalez> They definitely are.
[17:33:07] <scott_gonzalez> The past month or so has been pretty bad.
[17:33:07] <snover> worse like in content?
[17:33:13] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[17:33:18] <DaveMethvin> gotta figure out a way to keep the riff raff out without annoying the people who really have bugs to report
[17:33:39] <DaveMethvin> like, "your download link doesn't work, all I get is a javascript file"
[17:33:41] <scott_gonzalez> We require logins for UI.
[17:33:57] <snover> hahahaha
[17:33:57] <snover> aww.
[17:34:04] <DaveMethvin> i think if we improve the front-end form that will help
[17:34:06] <snover> but without those reports how will you be able to do dramatic readings, dave
[17:34:27] <DaveMethvin> it was funny at first but now it's just annoying
[17:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Another quality bug report: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12262
[17:35:43] <snover> sweeeeet
[17:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> Uhoh, did someone break core?
[17:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui
[17:38:44] <snover> only in oldie, and nobody cares about that anymore anyway
[17:38:52] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[17:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Do you want me to track down the commit?
[17:39:42] <DaveMethvin> well it almost has to be timmy's stuff if it just happened
[17:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[17:40:40] <scott_gonzalez> But he's not on right now for me to yell at :-P
[17:40:47] <scott_gonzalez> It's a selector bug.
[17:41:28] <DaveMethvin> which selector failed?
[17:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> element.find( ".ui-accordion-header" )
[17:42:12] <scott_gonzalez> It's scary that something so simple is failing.
[17:42:41] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[17:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to dig into this.
[17:43:07] <DaveMethvin> there must be something special about it? i can't imagine we don't have a similar test
[17:44:25] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...can't reproduce with a simple test.
[17:44:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm an idiot.
[17:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> I just tested in Chrome.
[17:46:15] <DaveMethvin> haha
[17:52:52] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: looks like an order issue?
[17:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Not sure, I'm having trouble reproducing by itself.
[17:54:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah my simple test case didn't break
[17:55:15] <DaveMethvin> but it looks like maybe the sort/unique stuff may be borked so let me try a test of that
[17:55:59] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's actually going to be related to a different selector.
[17:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> "> li > :first-child,> :not(li):even"
[17:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> Makes a lot more sense if that's the selector that's failing.
[17:58:44] <scott_gonzalez> That's what we're using to add the class that we're testing for later.
[17:59:26] <DaveMethvin> can always count on you to torture-test the selector engine
[17:59:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: pong
[17:59:42] <gnarf> gotta walk out the door super soon tho
[18:00:01] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: When I deploy jquery.com locally with the legacy branch of web-base-template I do not get a proper site.
[18:00:20] <scott_gonzalez> We can chat later if you're heading out.
[18:00:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: there is a legacy branch of jquery.com too
[18:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> ohhh....
[18:01:05] <DaveMethvin> no i'm stuck at home
[18:01:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i (re?)discovered this only like a week ago myself
[18:01:27] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: That heading out comment was meant for gnarf :-P
[18:01:39] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i see now :)
[18:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> son of a bitch, legacy uses pygmentize
[18:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: The download page looks right now, but I still don't get an index page.
[18:03:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: there is one in the legacy branch right? (walking out the door, sry)
[18:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yeah, maybe the theme got trashed. I'll check history. Thanks.
[18:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: This is really confusing me. I can't reduce this.
[18:08:19] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: neither can i
[18:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> I even went into the source and logged how many elements it finds and it's always the right number, even when the tests fail.
[18:09:27] <DaveMethvin> hmm, does this test look right? http://jsfiddle.net/fUnun/3/
[18:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I've got it failing now.
[18:11:31] <DaveMethvin> my test case looks like it's missing third para
[18:11:38] <DaveMethvin> in ie7 at least
[18:11:40] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's invalid markup
[18:11:56] <DaveMethvin> well what the heck are you selecting with that selector?
[18:12:38] <DaveMethvin> children that are li, plus children that are NOT li??
[18:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> In the case of a ul (which is where it's failling), we're selecting the first element inside each list item.
[18:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> The logic behind the selector is this:
[18:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> If the accordion is a list, then choose the first child of every list item to be a header.
[18:13:43] <scott_gonzalez> If the accordion is anything besides a list, choose every other child of the element to be a header.
[18:13:47] <DaveMethvin> ah, ok so the selectors dont apply in the same parent cases
[18:13:59] <DaveMethvin> that seems less insane
[18:14:05] <scott_gonzalez> Right, they're designed so that only one can match.
[18:15:34] <DaveMethvin> so what does your failing case look like?
[18:15:57] <DaveMethvin> damn, it is such a pain to edit test cases for ie7
[18:17:28] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's still just the unit test that I'm able to reproduce it with, but it *might* be dependent on running other selectors first.
[18:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> Of course my browser keeps hanging, making it a pain to debug.
[18:18:17] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[18:20:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, confirmed that it's order dependent.
[18:20:19] <scott_gonzalez> Which explains why we're having trouble reducing this.
[18:21:05] <DaveMethvin> oh boy, the most evil kind of bug
[18:30:09] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: http://jsfiddle.net/Gw42T/1/
[18:30:39] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: yep, broken
[18:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'll file a ticket.
[18:31:14] <scott_gonzalez> Man, Trac is failing left and right ronight.
[18:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> s/ronight/tonight/
[18:32:39] <DaveMethvin> ruh roh
[18:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12403
[18:33:08] <DaveMethvin> tryna tickle the selector to see what makes it fail
[18:40:49] <scott_gonzalez> I think we have an overly aggressive redirect rule on our web server...
[18:40:59] <scott_gonzalez> http://jquery.com/wp-admin/plugins.php is redirecting to plugins.jquery.com
[18:42:46] <gnarf> ?
[18:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> I can't get to the plugins admin page in WordPress.
[18:46:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is there a jquery.com checkout on the server? Or was it deployed from someone's local checkout?
[18:46:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: last time i deployed it from my local
[18:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[18:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> Does your local have a working index page right now?
[18:47:28] <gnarf> i don't have local WP
[18:47:41] <gnarf> i just deployed the jquery.com legacy branch
[18:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> heh, ok
[18:47:54] <gnarf> rewrite /plugins http://plugins.jquery.com/ redirect;
[18:49:00] <scott_gonzalez> Just got my local site working :-)
[18:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> There's a plugin that needs to be activated.
[18:49:15] <gnarf> that shouldn't match /wp-admin/plugins.php
[18:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> Is it redirecting for you?
[18:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> Or is there just something weird going on for me?
[18:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> This plugin seems weird. I wonder why Nacin wrote it.
[18:50:25] <gnarf> nope it's getting redirected
[18:50:38] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the good news is that I can now start working on moving jquery.com into master :-)
[18:56:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think i fixed the redirect
[18:56:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, thanks.
[19:00:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin - did you see that pull/ticket I submitted yesterday?
[19:00:47] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, .data?
[19:00:50] <gnarf> yup
[19:00:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah saw it
[19:01:01] <DaveMethvin> not sure about it tho
[19:01:14] <DaveMethvin> you must have had a use case?
[19:01:34] <gnarf> well, a) I was talking to someone in #jquery about how "most setters in the api accept a function"
[19:01:40] <gnarf> and thought about .data
[19:02:15] <gnarf> I've written a lot of stuff that does a this.each(function( i, elem ) { var data = jQuery( elem ).data(); data.____ });
[19:03:08] <DaveMethvin> i tend to get the data object and whack it directly too
[19:03:30] <gnarf> this does the each, and the .data() for you, and saves on code
[19:03:36] <DaveMethvin> might be interesting to write it out and see what it saves
[19:03:45] <gnarf> perf wise?
[19:03:53] <gnarf> ill do up a jsperf sometime tonight
[19:03:56] <DaveMethvin> expressively
[19:04:24] <gnarf> the ticket i think had a decent "use case"
[19:04:51] <gnarf> with a bunch of elements, check for some propreties from data- then call a UI widget on it
[19:05:08] <DaveMethvin> i'm just thinking of how it would look now vs then, was that in the ticket?
[19:05:14] <gnarf> yup
[19:05:19] <DaveMethvin> i didn't read it that closely
[19:05:33] <gnarf> "now" is basically "each" instead, and you have to $(this).data()
[19:05:37] <DaveMethvin> been painting and cleaning around the house all weekend
[19:06:04] <DaveMethvin> right i guess i want to look at the two side by side
[19:06:08] <DaveMethvin> but i can do that
[19:07:03] <DaveMethvin> if we were going to do that i think it would make sense to add it in 1.9 when we rip out all the old data event stuff
[19:08:51] <gnarf> im not in a rush
[19:09:02] <gnarf> and would prefer to not change API in the middle of a release
[19:09:12] <gnarf> i was figuring 1.9/2.0 anyway, just fishing up opinions :)
[19:23:49] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Getting jquery.com on master is almost too easy :-)
[19:26:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: nice
[19:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> Think I should push this to a branch for testing?
[19:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> Or can I just push to master in both repos?
[19:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> It only affects this one site, and it shouldn't be able to go into prod no matter what, since that's running off of legacy.
[19:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> Pushing to master would be the easiest for others to test.
[19:29:25] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^
[19:30:25] <gnarf> if you push to master on both
[19:30:29] <gnarf> you can verify it works on stage
[19:30:32] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[19:30:33] <gnarf> so i say just go for it
[19:30:38] <gnarf> and fix it if you break it
[19:30:39] <gnarf> :)
[19:34:18] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I get line numbers on stage, but not locally.
[19:34:21] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.jquery.com/
[19:34:45] <scott_gonzalez> must be out of date npm packages.
[19:34:46] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check
[19:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Where is the jquery.com checkout on the server?
[19:36:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: jq02.stage.jquery.com:/usr/local/wordpress-repos/jquery.com
[19:37:45] <gnarf> sudo -u jqdeploy and/or chown everything back if you play around in there
[19:40:08] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I ran `npm update` and `grunt deploy`
[19:40:20] <scott_gonzalez> Check out stage, it should be an almost identical match to prod.
[19:40:41] <scott_gonzalez> There's /, /download, and /browser-support
[19:40:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it should do those automatically upon a push-notify, did it not?
[19:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> It deployed, but didn't update
[19:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps it's doing an `npm install` instead?
[19:41:20] <gnarf> it is
[19:41:31] <gnarf> npm update then?
[19:41:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, let me just verify that it will work for initial install as well.
[19:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, it does.
[19:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> `npm install` won't update packages if they match the valid range.
[19:42:36] <scott_gonzalez> So since grunt-jquery-content is specified as 0.3.x and 0.3.0 was installed, it didn't update.
[19:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> Technically this means that the dependencies are wrong in jquery.com.
[19:43:29] <scott_gonzalez> But we should be running off the latest supported versions for out dependencies anyway.
[19:46:33] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm not sure what's involved in getting us off of legacy now.
[19:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> I can send an email to the dev list about this.
[19:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe get Richard to do a review before we push this live.
[19:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> email sent
[19:57:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: fixed it to do npm update in the future
[23:05:55] <Eviltwin> ?on
[23:05:55] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[23:05:56] <b-ot> bot-t, memorised “on()”.
[23:05:56] <bot-t> b-ot, Couldn't find "memorised “on()”." in jQuery Docs.
[23:06:02] <Eviltwin> Why are there two of those around?
