[01:33:29] <siovene> Hi all. I wrote a blog post on how to set up nginx+PHP+fastcgi on Ubuntu, in order to run jQuery unit-tests. I found that jQuery had no other docs than "set up your LAMP", so this might be useful: http://www.iovene.com/996/
[04:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> Damn, that zoom fix I landed really pissed off a lot of people.

[09:39:31] <JakeA> Been thinking about the requestanimationframe problem‚Ä¶
[09:40:15] <JakeA> The issues are down to how it behaves when the page is inactive, right?
[09:40:59] <JakeA> Could we use raf for animations, but fallback to setInterval when the page visibility api reports hidden?
[09:42:56] <gnarf> JakeA: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-requestAnimationFrame you can just use rAF always, and know the "issues"
[09:44:20] <gnarf> if you aren't using setTimeout/setInterval to queue animations, and only work in callbacks, rAF isn't much of a problem, you don't run into see ?9381
[09:44:38] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9381
[09:48:34] <JakeA> Yeah, I'm just thinking of ways it could be fixed in core jquery
[09:49:14] <JakeA> it's a worthy improvement, especially in webkit
[10:05:47] <gnarf> JakeA: we've thought about a few ways to fix it
[10:05:54] <gnarf> but they are all way more code than it should be
[10:06:01] <gnarf> to work around a "silly" edge case
[10:06:05] <gnarf> that you should be able to avoid
[10:06:14] <gnarf> if you don't abuse native timers :)
[10:06:59] <JakeA> agreed, but that silly case is blocking a performance benefit
[10:08:16] <JakeA> I agree that the people having problems with raf are doing it wrong. I'd rather see jquery use raf and people fix their code
[10:08:58] <JakeA> but understand why jquery reverted
[10:09:43] <JakeA> It'd be nice to get the raf benefit without having to opt in 
[10:38:10] <gnarf> JakeA: it's trivial to implement in a plugin now
[10:38:18] <gnarf> might as well just let it be a plugin
[10:38:19] <gnarf> IMO
[10:39:41] <JakeA> a plugin's a large barrier to entry
[10:40:04] <JakeA> the user would have to be aware of raf, aware that jquery didn't use it, & be aware of the plugin
[10:42:35] <gnarf> cc @DaveMethvin
[10:43:03] <scott_gonzalez> JakeA: They'd also need to be having issues in the first place to even care about rAF.
[10:43:07] <gnarf> Opinion noted, I have wanted it in core as is for a while, without any hacky shit to try to work around peoples annoying queue issues ;)
[10:43:11] <DaveMethvin> JakeA: conversely, if we use raf then people have to be aware of the issues it causes and work around them
[10:43:29] <DaveMethvin> in any case this can't be changed for about a year at this point
[10:43:43] <DaveMethvin> we're not making a change like that in a 1.9.x 
[10:44:21] <DaveMethvin> it saddens me that we have this great plugin arch but people seem to be dead-set on getting everything in the lib
[10:44:39] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure why we  have hook points if the only people who seem to use them are US
[10:44:49] <DaveMethvin> because it's "too hard" to add a small plugin
[10:44:57] <gnarf> JakeA: you could write a blog post about the raf plugin and why you shouldn't use jQuery without it... I wouldn't mind ;)
[10:45:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah i would like that too
[10:45:20] <DaveMethvin> we got slaughtered when we put in raf
[10:45:27] <DaveMethvin> because of all the code out there that makes assumptions
[10:45:33] <DaveMethvin> BAD assumptions but there it is
[10:45:42] <gnarf> good ole #9381
[10:45:48] <DaveMethvin> so all the smart people can use the plugin and be happy
[10:45:53] <gnarf> my most saddening moment ever
[10:45:54] <DaveMethvin> and god bless em
[10:46:16] <JakeA> DaveMethvin: I was suggesting falling back to setInterval when the tab is hidden to work around those issues
[10:46:38] <DaveMethvin> but the tab visiblity changes dynamically
[10:46:45] <JakeA> yep
[10:46:48] <gnarf> JakeA: there are issues with that though, like actually detecting the visibility
[10:46:50] <DaveMethvin> it's just a bunch of extra fussy code imo
[10:46:56] <gnarf> and its all got edges
[10:47:00] <JakeA> page visibility api is pretty stable
[10:47:10] <DaveMethvin> really JakeA if you could help us get out the word with some blog posts and code that woud be wonderful
[10:47:10] <gnarf> the only solution that made sense IMO was julians
[10:47:50] <DaveMethvin> we could say this change is going in 1.10/2.1 but i don't see that shipping for a long time
[10:47:56] <DaveMethvin> and we need lots of advanced notice
[10:48:04] <gnarf> His plan was to create a setTimeout() timed to run at the next "animation end" 
[10:48:14] <gnarf> that gets canceled/rewound in the .tick()
[10:48:18] <gnarf> that just calls .tick()
[10:48:22] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, that was sneaky
[10:48:28] <DaveMethvin> that jaubourg guy
[10:48:31] <gnarf> problem there
[10:48:36] <JakeA> I don't think this is a matter of communication, more a matter of improving jquery
[10:48:46] <gnarf> is that the non-focus browsers might have delayed setTimeout() as well
[10:48:55] <DaveMethvin> right
[10:49:04] <DaveMethvin> we can't trust setTimeout
[10:49:10] <DaveMethvin> when the window is out of focus
[10:49:27] <DaveMethvin> JakeA: it is ALWAYS a communication issue
[10:49:38] <DaveMethvin> changing semantics of our api is a minefield
[10:49:42] <DaveMethvin> no matter how much better it is
[10:50:03] <JakeA> which is why I'm suggesting the pagevisibility thing to maintain the semantics
[10:50:16] <DaveMethvin> way too messy imo
[10:50:34] <DaveMethvin> unless you already have a well tested impleentation
[10:51:07] <gnarf> JakeA: so now animation engine needs to listen to DOM events too?
[10:51:18] <gnarf> adds a dependency on events code that currently doesn't exist
[10:51:22] <DaveMethvin> what could possibly go wrong?
[10:51:25] <DaveMethvin> :D
[10:51:28] <gnarf> its all edges
[10:51:32] <JakeA> well, this is me testing the water to see if it's worth working on and presenting a solution. But it sounds like it's an insta-NO
[10:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> edges all the way down
[10:51:44] <gnarf> shave em how you like... jQuery provides the simple, plugins provide the edge
[10:51:54] <gnarf> JakeA: its not an instant no
[10:52:09] <DaveMethvin> JakeA: I'd rather communicate a date when we'll switch and the dangers therein than try a large complex hybrid approach
[10:52:12] <gnarf> JakeA: its a we've all argued about it for the past year a few times, so we are just catching you up :)
[10:52:45] <DaveMethvin> and given the hooks we provide, it's easy for people who know what they're doing to do it 
[10:52:47] <DaveMethvin> that's YOU!
[10:53:01] <DaveMethvin> sorry about the guys who peed in the pool
[10:53:18] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: like all the damn carousel plugins?
[10:53:20] <JakeA> I'm not trying to improve things for myself, more the people who dl jquery and use it blindly
[10:53:27] <JakeA> the majority, IMO
[10:53:42] <DaveMethvin> JakeA: yes, those are the same guys who prevented us making the change
[10:53:49] <JakeA> exactly
[10:53:56] <gnarf> JakeA: I would prefer that the 'average' user be using an rAF impl, but that is the exact same set of people who couldn't fix their problems with it
[10:54:37] <DaveMethvin> JakeA: what you're proposing sounds complex and regression-laden, so i think we can agree that it shouldn't go into 1.9.x
[10:54:47] <gnarf> i mean, my argument was that for every person who posted a bug, there were probably 90 who had no problems, and got the improvements, 10 who did and never reported it
[10:54:50] <JakeA> right, which is why I'm suggesting a fix that maintains behaviour. I understand it adds complexity, but so does all of the cross-browser stuff in jq
[10:55:00] <DaveMethvin> do you have code for that fix?
[10:55:15] <DaveMethvin> or are you suggesting that someone else write that code?
[10:55:43] <gnarf> I mean, I would entertain any PR that can solve it, but i honestly think jaubourgs approach will be best
[10:55:47] <JakeA> No, as I said before this is me testing the water to see if it's worth working on and presenting a solution, or if it's an insta-NO therefore a waste of time from the outset
[10:56:25] <gnarf> JakeA: If it binds to events on the window, I'm prolly gonna say "not the right way" IMO
[10:56:35] <DaveMethvin> JakeA: the reason we're saying "no" is that it seems like in our judgement this would be potentially a lot of bytes, complex and prone to failure, and therefore we don't want to tackle it
[10:56:46] <DaveMethvin> but who knows, maybe there is some solution we haven't thought of
[10:56:57] <DaveMethvin> but if it comes out being large, complex, and failure prone it can't land
[10:57:18] <gnarf> s/and/or/
[10:57:18] <DaveMethvin> and again i'd just prefer to say 1.10 will have raf and start preparing people
[10:58:56] <gnarf> I actually even made the base animation tick functions return their "ms remaining"
[10:59:06] <gnarf> in case we wanted to implement julians plan
[10:59:09] <gnarf> some day
[10:59:57] <JakeA> Failure prone can be defined by a failure case‚Ä¶ what's the definition of unacceptably large & complex?
[11:02:34] <JakeA> More to the point, what's the criteria for a jquery core solution to raf animation with backwards compat?
[11:02:58] <JakeA> "works consistently" is a given
