[03:23:55] <m_gol> Krinkle: it doesn't get updated so this link is kind of useless
[04:28:19] <m_gol> who has commit access to https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/?
[04:28:36] <m_gol> I wanted to close a ticket but I figured I can't
[04:59:31] <agcolom> m_gol: I think I do
[05:00:06] <m_gol> agcolom: my question was more of "who should have" :-)
[05:00:16] <agcolom> oh ;-)
[05:00:29] <agcolom> possibly people on the content team, but not 100% sure...
[05:01:48] <agcolom> btw, how about nominating the jQuery team to the .net awards? http://thenetawards.com/ 
[05:02:45] <agcolom> (there's a category for Team of the Year!)
[05:06:35] <m_gol> :)
[05:06:49] <m_gol> agcolom: btw, since I answered but coulnd't close, can you do it? https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/444
[05:18:16] <agcolom> m_gol: looks like scott_gonzalez just did it :-)
[05:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, it's the content team.
[05:21:53] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: If you're interested in being on the content team, we can add you, but you should be committed to it, which would be great.
[05:21:59] <scott_gonzalez> The content team could use some help.
[05:23:39] <m_gol> I'm not sure how much time will I have and I'm not sure how commited I should be :)
[05:28:52] <m_gol> I could certainly look into PRs once or twice a week in a busy week
[05:28:58] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez ^
[05:29:26] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: That sounds good to me.
[05:30:07] <scott_gonzalez> added
[05:30:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure you'll get an email for that, but being on the content team gives you access to every site as well.
[05:33:55] <m_gol> ok, thx
[07:51:26] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't api.jquery.com be using 1.10.2, not 1.9.1?
[07:53:11] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: it should :)
[07:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'll update it.
[07:53:40] <m_gol> you may also remove the protocol if you're at it
[07:54:00] <m_gol> ah, that's done now, pok
[07:54:01] <m_gol> * ok
[08:00:33] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[08:20:56] <Krinkle> Hi
[08:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> Hey Krinkle.
[08:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> I updated api.jquery.com, it should work better on HTTPS now.
[08:29:54] <scott_gonzalez> Please continue to file issues if you run into more problems.
[08:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> There's a deploy right now to fix a few more URLs (in pages instead of entries).
[08:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going through api.jqueryui.com right now, then I'm going to go through api.jquerymobile.com and api.qunitjs.com.
[08:32:22] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: 
[08:33:17] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Nice :)

[09:15:43] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: you're an animal! thanks for fixing all that stuff.
[09:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[12:12:00] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin gibson042 gnarf Krinkle markelog: Updated the commit message PR. Pinging all of you since you've participated in that discussion: https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/61#issuecomment-29840534
[12:12:10] <Krinkle> Thx
[12:12:41] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, were you not available for the ci meeting today? Or was the google calendar not updated?
[12:14:25] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I forgot about it :/
[12:14:41] <jzaefferer> Will set myself a reminder until I get used to this slot
[12:16:35] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: anyway, now that you mention, did you have something to share?
[12:16:51] <jzaefferer> I haven't done anything QUnit related in weeks
[12:17:14] <Krinkle> Not much visible yet, but there is progress. Working out the prototype chain for QUnit.Assertion.
[12:17:52] <Krinkle> especially to make the .not property work without having to flatten/copy over assertion methods, ideally we'd keep the link live so that new assertions can be registered at any time
[12:17:59] <Krinkle> but I think I've got it now.
[12:19:13] <Krinkle> Other than that, keeping up with browserstack and waiting to add new browsers and for jquery core team to give signal that one or more mobile browsers can be enabled in the primary job (once they pass) 
[12:19:56] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I haven't got the exact dates yet (will e-mail to dev-l once I have), but I'll be unavailable for the holidays between roughly Dec 20 and Jan 6
[12:20:57] <jzaefferer> cool, sounds good
[12:21:33] <jzaefferer> I'll land those docs updates tomorrow
[12:21:42] <jzaefferer> and see if there's something else we can ask him to work on
[12:22:02] <Krinkle> Especially the QUnit.push one should be landed, that one is good.
[12:22:37] <Krinkle> QUnit.extend I'm not sure whether that should be publicly documented. QUnit.assert seems a bit weird as an isolated page in category 'Configuration', it has duplicate content and no anchor links back to the category 'assert' or the indiivudla assert method documetnation pages and function signatures.
[12:22:47] <Krinkle> so maybe that one should be improved a bit furhter
[12:24:33] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: btw, I'd like to perhaps do a sprint of some kind in January or February (the two of us, and maybe more). Can probably go with a private venue somewhere in NL or DE perhaps with a connecting night so we have 2 days. Sounds good?
[13:28:59] <m_gol> Krinkle: ping
[15:16:36] <Krinkle> Ha! $('foo').end(); // [ #document ]
[15:16:40] <Krinkle> hello rootjQuery
[15:16:59] <Krinkle> m_gol: pong
[15:17:39] <m_gol> Krinkle: I've seen you said you wait for BrowserStack to update browsers
[15:17:49] <m_gol> but they already have all of them updated
[15:18:17] <m_gol> Safari 7, Chrome 31, new Opera, IE11 etc.
[15:18:21] <Krinkle> I'm not waiting for a particular update at the moment, just meant that I'm keeping an eye on browser updates and browserstack in general.
[15:19:13] <m_gol> ok
[15:19:28] <Krinkle> Yes, but it requires a fair amount of testing right now to add one. First to register in our TestSwarm config (without adding to a job yet), then to launch manaully and verify the user agent is parsed correctly to recognize it both-ways, and then to deploy the change again.  
[15:19:42] <m_gol> I see
[15:19:44] <Krinkle> being able to force a puppet run makes that easier :)
[15:19:47] <Krinkle> made*
[15:20:07] <m_gol> can this be automated in any way?
[15:20:08] <Krinkle> I'll do another run early on this Friday
[15:21:09] <m_gol> it seems it would help us a lot if it was simpler to do...
[15:22:57] <Krinkle> m_gol: At this point I don't feel like automation will save much time, as it would require a lot of small steps that are easy to do manually to be scripted. I'm sure it will pay off eventually, but I don't know if that's worth it at this point.
[15:23:36] <Krinkle> and with so many infrastructure changes on the horizon around cross-browser testing, I'd rather not take a deep investment to a script.
[15:23:47] <Krinkle> But even small automations could help of course, that's always welcome.
[15:24:14] <m_gol> Krinkle: I'm asking because I see this can be a lot of work so I understand why it takes time but on the other hand it makes catching regressions in core a little harder
[15:25:28] <m_gol> we'll be releasing the third beta of new versions soon so it's maybe nothing critical but we certainly need up-to-date browsers before the final release :) esp. new IE & Safari (and maybe iOS if we catch all breakages)
[15:26:12] <Krinkle> I'll be sure to push the line as far as we can with current support via browserstack.
[15:26:30] <m_gol> ok, thanks a lot!
[15:27:16] <m_gol> btw, I wonder if testing on new Opera matters in any way, the engine is pure Chromium after all
