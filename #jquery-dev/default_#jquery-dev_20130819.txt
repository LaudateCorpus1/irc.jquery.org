[10:10:06] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: just wanted to do that :)
[10:10:38] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I've recently been baffled by PhantomJS suckiness :(
[10:10:57] <m_gol> no Function.prototype.bind - I could live with that, I can polyfill that for tests
[10:10:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah the for/in on arguments was pretty disappointing
[10:11:04] <m_gol> yeah
[10:11:18] <m_gol> I wanted to use PhantomJS for tests on Jenkins on our current projects
[10:11:20] <DaveMethvin> why cant PhantomJS be based on Blink or something nice?
[10:11:32] <m_gol> but I'm not going to patch vendors to not iterate over arguments...
[10:11:33] <snover> because ancient webkit is much more fun
[10:11:42] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, "fun"
[10:12:02] <m_gol> from what I've heard they want to port it to QtWebkit 5.0 "sometime"
[10:12:11] <snover> Iâ€™m stuck in an emotional battle right now with myself over whether or not to add a bind shim in the dojo2 loader just so people can use phantomjs with intern
[10:12:25] <snover> since none of the other supported browsers require it
[10:12:28] <m_gol> but considering "hugeness" of this task as well as developer shortage, it might just die slowly instead :(
[10:12:35] <snover> but itâ€™s a small thing
[10:12:40] <DaveMethvin> seems like such a shame to fake things more for a fake browser
[10:12:55] <m_gol> yeah, I can live with small shims, I can't live with not being able to iterate over arguments
[10:13:03] <m_gol> it's not shimmable, that's bad :(
[10:13:33] <m_gol> I'd have to add a js2js preprocessor just so that PhantomJS understands it
[10:13:40] <DaveMethvin> lol
[10:14:02] <DaveMethvin> when they say PhantomJS is headless i think they meant brainless
[10:14:04] <m_gol> too bad there are no other headless browsers
[10:14:07] <m_gol> :D
[10:14:25] <m_gol> at least there is SlimerJS if you just need a scriptable browser, I have hopes for that
[10:14:31] <DaveMethvin> if we complain long enough maybe someone will create one
[10:14:35] <m_gol> though not headless
[10:14:47] <m_gol> but at least it's Gecko, not ancient WebKit
[10:14:58] <paul_irish> same with Chrome's CI hooks, not properly headless
[10:15:06] <paul_irish> but totally scriptable on platforms that chromium can run on
[10:15:37] <DaveMethvin> it's just so entrapping that PhantomJS is almost kinda good enough that we use it, even with its warts
[10:15:37] <paul_irish> i think ariya is flirting with the idea of porting phantom to chromium
[10:15:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would be sweet
[10:15:56] <m_gol> that would be so great :D
[10:16:23] <m_gol> doesn't seem to be a small task for 1 person, though :P
[10:16:32] <paul_irish> but he's ariya
[10:16:34] <paul_irish> he can do anything.
[10:16:50] <paul_irish> we should start a bountysource for it 
[10:16:56] <m_gol> :)
[10:17:27] <m_gol> I'd join such initiative!
[10:18:32] <m_gol> hmm, seems BrowserStack lacks Android 3.0
[10:18:49] <DaveMethvin> who uses that?
[10:18:58] <DaveMethvin> i think it was only on some tablets
[10:19:17] <m_gol> yeah, it was
[10:19:28] <m_gol> still, it'd be nice to be able to test against that
[10:19:51] <m_gol> well, if we drop support for 2.3, we'll drop it for 3.x as well, anyway
[10:20:03] <m_gol> * if -> when ;)
[10:20:13] <DaveMethvin> since some phones are still shipping with 2.3 it may be a few years :(
[10:21:02] <m_gol> paul_irish, could you ping sb about that: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=275327? the spec changed in March, so far only Firefox has implemented a change. :(
[10:21:13] <m_gol> and it's after CR already so it's a PITA
[10:22:05] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: context: the Flexbox spec was changed after CR so that in a flex container padding-top: 50% means 50% of height, not witdth as it is with block elements
[10:22:48] <m_gol> which effectively means you can't use % on {margin,padding}-{top,bottom}...
[10:23:22] <m_gol> wasn't nice when I found that info :?
[10:23:25] <m_gol> * :/
[10:23:53] <paul_irish> ruhroh
[10:23:56] <paul_irish> ok
[10:24:26] <m_gol> if Firefox didn't implement it already, I'd say change back the spec to reflect reality but it's too late for that
[10:24:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah so why did the spec change?
[10:24:47] <m_gol> if IE11 won't get fixed before release, we'll get stuck with this mess for a long time
[10:24:58] <m_gol> to be consistent with grid layout
[10:25:04] <DaveMethvin> oh
[10:25:13] <m_gol> Firefox had it implemented like that since the beginning
[10:25:23] <m_gol> they got a ticket to fix it and instead the spec was changed
[10:25:30] <m_gol> but no vendor implemented a new version :/
[10:25:46] <m_gol> which makes for some lovely feature detects
[10:26:07] <DaveMethvin> i have a feeling ie11 is locked down at this point, some stories had it shipping in october
[10:26:15] <m_gol> of cource, no purely-CSS fallback is possible
[10:26:21] <DaveMethvin> so if it didn't get changed it's gonna be a while
[10:26:25] <m_gol> yeah, that's what I'm afraid about :/
[10:26:42] <m_gol> I reported it to them, surprised it didn't get much attention before...

[10:31:32] <jqcommit> 13jquery/06master 14215cc09 15MichaÅ‚ GoÅ‚eÌ¨biowski: No ticket. Add a support note about defaultPrevented missing in Android < 4.0
[10:32:28] <m_gol> is https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1298 ready to land?
[10:32:29] <b-ot> m_gol: Pull request #1298 by b1lly (1mon 3w ago): fixes .css() #13956
[10:34:29] <DaveMethvin> m_gol can't that be compressed more?
[10:35:49] <m_gol> gibson was able to gain 11 bytes but that's all I'm afraid
[10:36:07] <m_gol> so it's +33 now
[10:36:40] <DaveMethvin> seems like it should be possible to shrink it more, there's a pattern there
[10:36:52] <DaveMethvin> hold off on landing it, i'll take a look
[10:37:31] <m_gol> k
[10:38:25] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: yeah, if instead of each over an 4-element array change it to {top: 'bottom', left: 'right'}
[10:38:50] <DaveMethvin> yes, then you can avoid the duplication
[10:39:03] <m_gol> or {width: ['left', 'right'], height: ['top', 'bottom']}
[10:39:16] <m_gol> bc width/height is obviously needed as well
[10:39:20] <DaveMethvin> right
[10:39:25] <m_gol> so it seems compressable, indeed
[10:39:42] <DaveMethvin> and as a bonus, it will be even HARDER to maintain! :)
[10:39:56] <DaveMethvin> that code should go away when webkit gets fixed 
[10:40:08] <DaveMethvin> HAHAH when webkit gets fixed, sometimes i am so funny
[10:41:18] <m_gol> ;)
[10:41:33] <m_gol> even better: when WebKit on Android 2.3 phones gets fixed :P
[10:42:03] <m_gol> hmm... I'm looking at the order test workaround
[10:42:29] <m_gol> we only need WebKit prefix for `order` but there's -ms-flex-order in IE10
[10:42:51] <DaveMethvin> but that's the old flexbox model i think
[10:43:07] <m_gol> actually, that's the middle one :)
[10:43:13] <m_gol> from 2012 working draft
[10:43:24] <m_gol> there were 3 versions
[10:43:49] <DaveMethvin> good thing they got a final draft before they changed the names again
[10:43:56] <m_gol> first display: box, then display: flexbox, then display: flex (and also multiple other changes as well)
[10:44:02] <DaveMethvin> bex: flox
[10:44:06] <m_gol> ;D
[10:44:36] <DaveMethvin> let's wait for someone to report a bug before adding the -ms- one, i suspect nobody will use it
[10:44:57] <DaveMethvin> at this point i think ie is on a relatively fast upgrade track since IE9
[10:45:05] <m_gol> yep
[10:45:12] <m_gol> and IE10 should go away faster than IE9
[10:45:23] <m_gol> considering it's going to be released on Win7
[10:45:29] <m_gol> and Vista is stuck on IE9
