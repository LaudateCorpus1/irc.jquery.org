[08:17:55] <DaveMethvin> gnarf i dunno
[08:18:11] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: can you think of any reason not to make it public?
[08:18:41] <DaveMethvin> it's one of our newish wp repos?
[08:18:43] <scott_gonzalez> Can't think of any reason.
[08:18:51] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we keep anything secret there

[09:45:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: What your release note writing secret?
[09:45:38] <DaveMethvin> i patched it, i hacked it, but there ain't no way i'm ever gonna fix it, but don't be sad, cause two out of three ain't bad
[09:46:17] <ryanneufeld> So poetic DaveMethvin
[09:47:03] <gnarf> so i need to write a release note for color 2.1.0, I never even wrote the one for 2.0.0
[09:47:04] <gnarf> ;)
[09:47:31] <ryanneufeld> out of curiosity, anyone know what's up with the jqconf vids from this year?
[09:47:43] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: they're supposedly on their way
[09:47:50] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i just start writing
[09:47:57] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: we had to call a last minute change of intro song tho
[09:48:04] <ryanneufeld> oh?
[09:48:22] * gnarf shrugs
[09:48:22] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

[10:32:47] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Color build #77: FAILURE in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/77/
[10:32:47] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: Ammending AUTHORS.TXT
[10:33:04] <ryanneufeld> damnit gnarf :p
[10:41:14] <gf3> EVERYTHING IS FUCKED NOW, gnarf
[10:41:17] <gf3> GOOD ONE
[10:54:05] <gnarf> seems ie6 never started....
[11:22:22] <ryanneufeld> *sigh*  so tired of having to build a bad UX just because page views are important
[11:34:45] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Color build #78: STILL FAILING in 30 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/78/
[11:34:45] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: Bumping version to 2.1.1pre
[11:52:59] <ak> hi
[12:17:14] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: something is up on swarm
[12:17:17] <Krinkle> IE6 is not running?
[12:17:20] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/603
[12:20:06] <gnarf> Krinkle: I've noticed as well
[12:20:28] <gnarf> hadn't looked at it yet tho
[12:22:08] <timmywil> gibson042: ping
[12:22:17] <gibson042> hey there
[12:22:19] <timmywil> got something for you! :)
[12:22:21] <timmywil> https://github.com/timmywil/sizzle/compare/master...pseudos
[12:23:07] <gnarf> Krinkle: seems the testswarm API is reporting we already have 2 queued browsers
[12:23:20] <Krinkle> ok
[12:23:26] <Krinkle> in that case just browserstack being busy
[12:23:37] <gibson042> hoo boy; this looks fun
[12:23:59] <gnarf> er not swarm, browserstack
[12:24:06] <Krinkle> yeah, I figured :)
[12:24:12] <timmywil> gibson042: doing IE testing now. perf doesn't look bad at all
[12:25:19] <gibson042> can you summarize the changes so I have some background when looking at it?
[12:28:01] <timmywil> basically, all grouping is done with tokenize, I added central caching system, Expr.order is now a regex because everything is already tokenized. The main places to look at are tokenize, element-rooted QSA, and the new set reduction in select.
[12:28:08] <timmywil> gibson042: ^
[12:29:09] <timmywil> the area that I'm still iffy about is my replacement of rselector with a combination of rpseudoWithArgument and an adjustment to the pseudos regex
[12:29:28] <timmywil> I might have to put rselector back, but maybe you have an idea
[12:31:31] <timmywil> My reasoning was that parens need only be treated specially if they are part of a pseudo. I know you may not like that part, but it would allow :contains(link()) to work while :contains(:link()) would call a custom pseudo
[12:32:47] <gibson042> and what about `:contains(link))`?
[12:33:50] <timmywil> currently invalid
[12:33:59] <timmywil> treated as an extra paren
[12:34:05] <gibson042> that's such a mess
[12:35:15] <timmywil> yea I suppose that's a little weird
[12:35:22] <timmywil> gibson042: so what is ideal?
[12:37:22] <timmywil> we could make it so :contains(link)) is valid
[12:38:01] <gibson042> timmywil: I think closing parentheses in pseudo arguments must be quoted, and the argument is the longest string after opening parenthesis that doesn't break validity
[12:38:29] <timmywil> DaveMethvin
[12:38:42] <gibson042> I can't find that one commit I had that did something like that
[12:39:01] <DaveMethvin> yeah seems like you should quote those timmywil
[12:39:25] <timmywil> gibson042: was that the commit that added a private param to tokenize?
[12:39:37] <gibson042> yeah, that sounds like it
[12:40:51] <timmywil> I'll look at that again. I'd like to avoid doing that to tokenize, but perhaps tokenize is still the answer.
[12:41:11] <gibson042> I also have some other ideas, but haven't had the time to flesh them out
[12:41:59] <gibson042> here's that commit: https://github.com/gibson042/sizzle/commit/c8858be11da010e235ea6b0d0a869a3323be1472
[12:43:19] <gibson042> regarding the other ideas, I was thinking that the top-level matcher functions would take arrays instead of elements, and non-positional groups would use elements while positional groups split unmatched elements into matched/unmatched arrays of equal length
[12:44:02] <gibson042> because otherwise we run the risk of `:not(:first, :even)` being unequivalent to `:not(:even, :first)`
[12:44:14] <gibson042> but I'll see if I can get something working this weekend
[14:21:29] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: so what I have now will fix most if not all of the bugs currently in the queue. gibson and I will work on the tweaks for parens, but I think everything is in a good place.
[14:21:43] <timmywil> performance is still comparable
[14:22:01] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: that's great news!
[14:22:27] <timmywil> I know I have at least 3 closed. Checking the list...
[14:23:03] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/timmywil/sizzle/compare/master...pseudos
[14:23:25] <timmywil> it may look like a lot. Not much changed in POS, I just moved it.
[14:23:52] <timmywil> the cache is fun
[14:24:02] <DaveMethvin> k, i'll take a look over the weekend.
[14:24:22] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: should I go ahead and push or you want to review first?
[14:24:36] <DaveMethvin> if  you're  happy with it, ga and push, i'll review
[14:24:42] <DaveMethvin> that way we can see what testswarm thinks
[14:24:48] <DaveMethvin> i cleaned up the mess i made last night
[14:24:50] <DaveMethvin> so it should be good
[14:25:08] <timmywil> cool
