[07:46:37] <leobalter> JamesMGreene: it's your bday today? Happy Birthday! 
[07:46:49] <JamesMGreene> thanks, leobalter 
[07:46:56] <JamesMGreene> Yes, I am celebrating by speaking at a conference... lol
[07:47:20] <leobalter> not the best way to chill out :)
[07:50:40] <JamesMGreene> Not so much
[07:51:05] <JamesMGreene> But it's an inaugural regional JS conference for my metro area, so I figured I should help it succeed

[07:51:48] <JamesMGreene> Also apparently gathering intel for kborchers :-P
[07:52:02] <kborchers> :)
[12:09:40] <s5fs> JamesMGreene: if you speak on your bday you can do no wrong. show up in a party hat, drunk and then wait for the praise on twitter
[12:46:52] <JamesMGreene> Wow, the Ember Inspector is amazeballs
[12:47:12] <JamesMGreene> Way better than Angular Batarang
