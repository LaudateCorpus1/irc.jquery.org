[10:51:29] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Hi
[11:13:47] <Krinkle> Does anyone know if we need to do anything for the Portland event? I RSVPed to the initial mail, but not sure whether we need to submit talks or arrange travel, or something  (still a few months away I guess that'll happen later?)
[12:11:13] <gnarf> Krinkle: ajpiano or rworth prolly the best to ask re: conf stuff
[12:43:58] <ajpiano> Krinkle:  the cfp is open already
[12:44:02] <ajpiano> you can and shoudl submit talks
[12:44:05] <ajpiano> i need to remind the dev team
[13:22:53] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/22e28b01e60e87b2454f88ca128fb84916b13564
[13:22:53] <b-ot> Krinkle: unknown (25mon 4w ago): Changed dataConverters key format.
[13:47:17] <Gho5t> anyone have a moment to walk through setting me up to contribute
[13:49:09] <scott_gonzalez> Gho5t: What do you need help with?
[13:49:28] <scott_gonzalez> I guess the first question is which project(s) do you plan to contribute to?
[13:49:41] <Gho5t> which ones are there?
[13:49:55] <Gho5t> jQuery and jQuery UI?
[13:50:28] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Mobile, Sizzle, Color, QUnit, TestSwarm, all of our 2 dozen sites, etc.
[13:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> According to GitHub we have 60 public repos ;-)
[13:50:57] <Gho5t> ah
[13:51:01] <Gho5t> ok jQuery
[13:51:05] <Gho5t> is my target
[13:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so first thing you'll want to do is fork https://github.com/jquery/jquery
[13:51:48] <scott_gonzalez> Then create a local clone of your fork.
[13:52:01] <Gho5t> ok I have that and I set up my upstream remote
[13:52:12] <Gho5t> I guess my next question was how to build it
[13:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have node installed?
[13:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery#how-to-build-your-own-jquery
[13:53:07] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery#what-you-need-to-build-your-own-jquery
[13:53:29] <Gho5t> I do
[13:53:41] <Gho5t> was reading this
[13:53:43] <Gho5t> http://docs.jquery.com/Tips_for_jQuery_Bug_Patching
[13:53:46] <Gho5t> I installed grunt
[13:53:51] <Gho5t> after that step
[13:54:04] <Gho5t> it seems to think you're magically up and running
[13:54:06] <scott_gonzalez> After you run grunt, you should have a built version in dist/
[13:54:42] <scott_gonzalez> Don't read docs.jquery.com
[13:54:48] <Gho5t> whree is "dist/"
[13:54:51] <Gho5t> *where
[13:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> In the root of the checkout.
[13:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> docs.jquery is deprecated and will go away soon.
[13:55:52] <Gho5t> ok
[13:56:10] <Gho5t> i see build, speed, src, test
[13:56:14] <Gho5t> no dist/
[13:56:21] <Gho5t> maybe I didn't run grunt correctly
[13:56:28] <Gho5t> actually I just installed it
[13:56:30] <Gho5t> and did nothing else
[13:56:35] <Gho5t> what would be the next step?
[13:56:47] <scott_gonzalez> Follow the steps in https://github.com/jquery/jquery#how-to-build-your-own-jquery
[13:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, this reminds me of when Dave was giving a presentaiton and said something like "We documented how to do a build in the README, so you'll never be able to find it."
[13:59:00] <JamesMGreene> lol
[13:59:05] <Gho5t> lol
[13:59:35] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Can I quote you on "scott_gonzalez: Don't read docs.jquery.com" ?
[13:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> Developers somehow manage to miss the obvious (README) and find more obscure things (like a page on the deprecated docs site)
[13:59:46] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: yes
[13:59:52] <Krinkle> :)
[14:00:25] <Krinkle> It's funny out of context
[14:00:31] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:01:15] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez dude... for real.
[14:01:16] <Gho5t> so grunt --force will build I guess 
[14:01:17] <Gho5t> with warnings
[14:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> screenshots of short IRC logs are always fun
[14:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://temp.nemikor.com/google-youtube-whatwg-irc.png
[14:01:30] <Gho5t> after that I don't see a /dist dir
[14:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> Gho5t: If you need to --force, then something is wrong.
[14:01:52] <Gho5t> k
[14:01:55] <scott_gonzalez> What's the output without --force?
[14:02:14] <Gho5t> Running "update_submodules" task
[14:02:24] <Gho5t> Warning: Error: not found: git Use -force to continue
[14:02:34] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez nice
[14:02:39] <Gho5t> Aborted due to warnings
[14:03:02] <rwaldron> git not found?
[14:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[14:03:15] <Gho5t> yes
[14:03:19] <Gho5t> I installed the GUI
[14:03:24] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[14:03:27] <Gho5t> need to install the cmd line client?
[14:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you'll want git in your path.
[14:04:24] <Gho5t> k
[14:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> I can't imagine that a GUI is installed withoug the CLI. I would guess the CLI just isn't in your PATH.
[14:15:54] <Gho5t> scott_gonzalez: ok, it built
[14:17:01] <Gho5t> so I guess I have to instlal WAMP if I want to run the tests
[14:17:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you'll need a web server than can run PHP.j
[14:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ignore that extraneous j :-P
[14:31:30] <Gho5t> ok can't get wamp to startup
[14:31:31] <Gho5t> rebooting
[14:55:46] <Gho5t> crap
[14:55:55] <Gho5t> "cannot execute menu item" from wampt
[14:55:57] <Gho5t> wamp
[14:59:45] <Gho5t> k got it
[15:01:47] <Gho5t> scott_gonzalez: now that I have wamp running and type grunt watch, what is next?
[15:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> If you open the test/ directory in your browser (going through WAMP, not file://), the tests should run.
[15:03:07] <Gho5t> sorry...so if my directory is C:\Other\Git\jQuery\test
[15:03:23] <Gho5t> you're saying navigate to there from http://localhost in my browser?
[15:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> It depends how you have WAMP setup.
[15:03:49] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15Krinkle opened pull request #1176: Optimisation: Use String instead of window.String. (06master...06window-prop/String)  02http://git.io/FeIhow
[15:04:00] <scott_gonzalez> For example, I have a vhost setup that points jquery.code.dev to my jquery checkout.
[15:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> But you can have it setup however you want.
[15:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery won't care if it's at the top level or not.
[15:04:24] <scott_gonzalez> So if you can get to your checkout from localhost, that's fine.
[15:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano DaveMethvin|away: Perhaps we should document how to setup popular environments.
[15:07:34] <Gho5t> ok I setup an alias
[15:07:37] <Gho5t> and it's running
[15:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[15:07:43] <Gho5t> getting some errors
[15:07:44] <Gho5t> : )
[15:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[15:07:52] <Gho5t> but seems to be due to php setup
[15:08:48] <Gho5t> core: Unit Testing Environment (2, 2, 4)Re
[15:08:58] <Gho5t> Running in an environment with PHP support. The AJAX tests only run if the environment supports PHP!
[15:08:59] <Gho5t> Unit tests are not ran from file:// (especially in Chrome. If you must test from file:// with Chrome, run it with the --allow-file-access-from-files flag!)
[15:09:01] <Gho5t> No AJAX requests are still active

[15:09:55] <Gho5t> also Uncaught Error: Could not load: ../src/sizzle/test/ (error)
[15:11:35] <Gho5t> any ideas on that
[15:16:31] <gnarf> Gho5t: npm install ; git submodule init / update ; grunt ?
[15:16:47] <Gho5t> i shall try it
[15:19:03] <Gho5t> same errors
[15:20:18] * gnarf shrugs, boarding call time... gotta run
[15:20:18] <b-ot> gnarf: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[15:20:23] <gnarf> `glwt
[15:20:25] <Gho5t> yeah
[15:20:32] <Gho5t> will try again tomorrow
[15:24:16] <Krinkle> Gho5t: From command line: npm install; git submodule update --init; and then do "grunt", which will execute a range of tests that might explain what the problem is
[15:50:35] <snover> DaveMethvin|away: come back!
