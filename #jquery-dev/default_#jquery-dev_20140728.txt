[09:18:29] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: it can think it's up to date if the update service is broken
[09:18:47] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: e.g. if you install stable & beta side by side, beta will always claim it's up to date
[09:19:08] <scott_gonzalez> I just have stable and canary
[09:21:18] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: yes, I was only pointing out that beta relies on the same update service stable does so if stable claims it's up to date, beta will too
[09:21:37] <m_gol> so it seems like the update service points to a different thing that it used to which can cause such problems
[09:45:17] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: did you report a ticket about it?

[11:32:39] <Krinkle> # -> jquery/qunit#
[11:33:20] <leobalter> done :)
[11:34:59] <leobalter> my bad there. I wish github could be ultra smart to make that reference.  
[11:35:20] <Krinkle> Looks like #jquery-testing has been merged back into #jquery-dev and #jquery-infrastructure.
[11:35:25] <Krinkle> Empty.

[11:35:37] <jqcommit> 13qunit-reporter-junit/06master 145adb7b6 15Timo Tijhof: travis: Update channel to #jquery-dev...
[11:35:51] <Krinkle> Ha, looks like the github hook already pointed here
[11:36:21] <leobalter> woot
[11:36:50] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: You've got admin rights on github/jquery repos, right? Can you check config of irc hooks set up for qunit* repos and make sure there's none pointing at #jquery-testing still?
[11:36:54] <Krinkle> I think there might be one or two.
[11:37:06] <Krinkle> qunit, qunitjs.com, api.qunitjs.com, qunit-*
[11:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: sure
[11:37:57] <Krinkle> woot, and we've got search permalinks now, thanks GitHub :)
[11:37:57] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery?query=qunit
[11:38:39] <Krinkle> btw, I'm assuming this is on purpose and not just an accident. I just noticed the channel was empty (no ChanServ either)
[11:40:39] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/qunit-reporter-junit#39 (master - 5adb7b6 : Timo Tijhof): The build passed.
[11:40:39] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit/compare/a96c0a57c156...5adb7b604eac
[11:40:39] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit/builds/31069245
[11:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: qunit-composite was pointing at #jquery-testing, updated to #jquery-dev.
[11:41:00] <scott_gonzalez> Everything else was right.
[11:44:05] <Krinkle> cool
[11:44:33] <Krinkle> noticed last couple weeks this channel is a bit lower traffic than usual
[11:44:37] <Krinkle> time of the year?
[11:45:17] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, likely time of year, lots of people on vacation/travelling.
[11:46:39] <Krinkle> I'm relocating to London over the next few months (from the Netherlands). Quite excited about that. Currently visiting London for a few weeks to check out places (and also to attend the annual Wikimania conference, wikimania.org)
[11:47:24] <Krinkle> free food, t-shirt, lots of developers, ops, writers, photographers, 200 talks, 50¬£. </promo>
[11:47:55] <Krinkle> Who do we have in London btw? Would be nice to maybe hangout some point.
[11:48:30] <Krinkle> I recall agcolom being (close to?) London.
[11:48:31] <scott_gonzalez>  agcolom
[11:48:44] <Krinkle> Cool
[11:54:41] <Krinkle> leobalter: Hm.. assert>Assert. I'm not sure. I didn't bother pointing it out, but I actually found a bit confusing it was uppercased all over.
[11:55:08] <Krinkle> Except for Assert actually, since that's a constructor
[11:55:38] <Krinkle> but "Core: ", "Test: ", "Build: " looked confusing, especially "Throws: " looked weird.
[11:55:56] <Krinkle> But I'll adapt for now
[11:57:51] <leobalter> it really looks breaking in a code perspective. I see it as a structural module name. It could also be "Src: " if not that specific
[11:58:18] <Krinkle> Sure, but why CamelCase?
[11:58:41] <Krinkle> even when the original name isn't.
[11:59:39] <Krinkle> I don't mind, I guess you could justify it as the start of a sentence, but then again, we don't want a full stop.
[11:59:45] <leobalter> IHMO, it should be capitalized names, not CamelCase or something else
[12:01:26] <leobalter> and it should be only to follow the commit guidelines, as they're called Components and have no mention for camel case, etc http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/#commit-guidelines
[12:02:05] <Krinkle> with CamelCase I meant to emphasize them being converted to uppercase first.
[12:02:12] <leobalter> ah
[12:02:14] <Krinkle> Not so much the the second cap
[12:02:51] <leobalter> so that's the mentioned Component's name
[12:03:35] <leobalter> like "Ajax: ..." for some $.ajax code
[12:03:51] <Krinkle> e.g. In projects outside jquery that use components they tend to use the original (eg.. tests:, readme:, history:, npm: travis: and for src stuff; EventEmitter:, util:, addClass: etc.)
[12:04:07] <Krinkle> nodejs, oojs, and I think also git and linux do this, though not sure.
[12:05:37] <leobalter> tbh I don't like to have the compenent's name starting the commit msg, I follow because I prefer consistency. 
[12:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Core, Test, Build, Throws, Assert are all correct.
[12:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> Though, really I'm not sure if Throws should be considered a component.
[12:08:18] <leobalter> I understand Krinkle's point on setting `assert` as the component name, but it looks the guidelines says it to be `Assert` 
[12:08:41] <scott_gonzalez> Components != methods/constructors/etc.
[12:09:35] <leobalter> throws is from Assert.prototype. it looks like the component is Assert too. 
[12:10:09] <leobalter> but it goes strange when you make changes on deepEqual
[12:10:20] <leobalter> and deepEqual is huge enough
[12:14:26] <Krinkle> leobalter: Made the adjustment about 20 minutes ago to the commit :)
[12:17:06] <leobalter> landed :)
[12:17:15] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15leobalter closed pull request #610: Add support for assert.throws expecting any arbitary object (06master...06issue/609) 02http://git.io/qMNemA
[12:17:16] <leobalter> my first landing
[12:20:40] <leobalter> Krinkle: I rebased and updated qunit#607 
[12:21:40] <leobalter> with it, I think we should be all set to 1.15 
[13:33:51] <agcolom> Hi, Krinkle scott_gonzalez yes, I'm in London
[13:36:13] <agcolom> Krinkle: so you're moving to London? Cool! I'm away from wednesday to 2nd Sept, but will be back after that
[13:40:44] <Krinkle> agcolom: I'm there from July 22 -August 14
[13:41:30] <agcolom> Krinkle: And do you come back after that?
[13:41:31] <Krinkle> hope to move between september - january, pending on availability. If I find a palce I like that I sign sign up for that isn't available until December, I'd stil take it. Though ideally I want to move in October.
[13:41:50] <agcolom> Excellent! 
[13:42:20] <Krinkle> Been looking mostly at Highbury/Islington/Arsenal area. Liking it a lot there and knew a few people who live there.
[13:43:16] <Krinkle> agcolom: You teach at one of the universities here, right?
[13:43:17] <agcolom> I'm in the south east but work in the center (oxford circus/warren st/Tottenham Court Rd/Goodge st)
[13:43:32] <agcolom> yes. University of Westminster
[13:43:40] <agcolom> The Cavendish Campus
[13:43:40] <Krinkle> cool
[13:46:23] <Krinkle> agcolom: Ha, interesting. Seems almost everyone I know in London teaches.
[13:46:33] <Krinkle> Though no two at the same place.
[13:46:57] <agcolom> where are your other friends?
[13:47:29] <Krinkle> mostly private education actually.
[13:48:52] <agcolom> ok. 
[13:49:07] <agcolom> got to go... Speak later
[13:49:12] <Krinkle> And one the royal opera house.
[13:49:18] <Krinkle> not sure which uni the other teaches at.
[13:49:20] <agcolom> oh that's v nice!
[13:49:21] <Krinkle> alrighty, cya
[13:49:24] <Krinkle> agcolom: check fb
[13:49:28] <agcolom> ok
[17:26:02] <ryanneufeld> anyone heard from kris lately?
