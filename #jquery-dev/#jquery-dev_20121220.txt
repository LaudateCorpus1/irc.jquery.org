[02:25:53] <jzaefferer> hey Krinkle, thanks for all the QUnit cleanup! Just looked at the four commits, looking good.
[02:26:21] <Krinkle> Krinkle/dom-TreeWalker-polyfill/test
[02:26:27] <Krinkle> I needed it :P
[03:10:57] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin gnarf scott_gonzalez: We have effects regression in core-git tests. Last green: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1873 started failing: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1886 all red: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/1900 - I don't see related changes in UI, so very likely caused by something in core.
[06:19:25] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez: on that fail for "datepicker: core:Â widget method - empty collection" in http://swarm.jquery.org/result/696733
[06:19:35] <DaveMethvin> locally, I see it in alternate runs
[06:19:48] <DaveMethvin> and there is a datepicker outside the fixture, left behind
[06:20:42] <DaveMethvin> http://wnd8.com/grab/9dbfc8.png
[06:32:44] <gibson042> DaveMethvin you're looking at the same things I am :)
[06:32:55] <DaveMethvin> well good!
[06:33:02] <DaveMethvin> i'm calling for backup!
[06:34:10] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: did you see anything else in those UI fails? The Mobile folks say they're doing fine on the 1.9 beta
[06:40:01] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yeah, the datepicker thing is because datepicker is all busted.
[06:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> It fails if it's not the first test.
[06:40:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's been like that since the day the test was written.
[06:41:11] <DaveMethvin> so should we be worried about any of these fails scott_gonzalez? don't want to leave you hangin
[06:42:02] <DaveMethvin> with jquery=git i'm seeing a consistent fail in customStructure
[06:42:19] <DaveMethvin> i also see a .focus() there which makes me nervous
[06:43:34] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, i don't see a length on that jquery object when dp returns...am i missing something?
[06:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...tests *should* be passing.
[06:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> At least, I had them passing when I did all the focus cleanup.
[06:44:54] <scott_gonzalez> Minus the accordion IE7 one.
[06:45:01] <DaveMethvin> only failing on -git
[06:45:12] <DaveMethvin> i'll look at teh customStructure one
[06:45:20] <scott_gonzalez> So these might be new failures.
[06:45:54] <scott_gonzalez> I've been digging through site stuff this week, haven't been paying too much attention to the UI tests.
[06:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> But in the back of my mind, I know that means a lot of work for me later.
[06:46:08] <scott_gonzalez> Because I've seen swarm, and it ain't pretty.
[06:47:25] <DaveMethvin> aaaugh, i forgot that i have to run these serially
[09:06:59] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: sorry about being dense, i see what you're talking about  now
[09:07:59] <DaveMethvin> it just seems strange that selects return an empty value when disabled, since no other input does ... does it?
[09:08:24] <gibson042> selects *are* strange
[09:08:50] <gibson042> <select><option disabled></select> <--- what the hell is a valid interpretation?
[09:09:02] <DaveMethvin> right
[09:09:26] <DaveMethvin> i probably saw that multi-select code in .val() 100 times and didn't think about it
[09:09:42] <gibson042> honestly, it seems like an invalid state to have a select-one with no logical selection
[09:10:36] <DaveMethvin> yeah, didn't we get/close a bug about that recently?
[09:10:45] <DaveMethvin> selectedIndex=-1
[09:11:08] <gibson042> probably
[09:11:11] <gibson042> it sounds familiar
[09:11:17] <DaveMethvin> looking
[09:11:30] <DaveMethvin> we must have, it's in my autocomplete for the search box :D
[09:11:38] <gibson042> lol
[09:12:11] <gibson042> wontfix: select-one where selectedIndex doesn't identify a non-disabled option :P
[09:12:37] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15orkel opened pull request #1094: 2.0: Reduce manipulation module (06master...062.0-manipulation)  02http://git.io/pZ8CNQ
[09:12:59] <DaveMethvin> yay orkel!
[09:14:50] <DaveMethvin> i hate all these crazy cases...can't people just do REASONABLE things in their code?
[09:16:06] <DaveMethvin> well let's leave it alone for a while, the old way of only ignoring disabled options on multis seems inconsistent in any case
[09:16:09] <gibson042> if they can, we've yet to see it
[09:16:22] <DaveMethvin> WHY DOES SOMEONE HAVE A DISABLED OPTION SELECTED?
[09:16:40] <DaveMethvin> just deselect it when you disable it
[09:16:45] <DaveMethvin> DUH
[09:17:05] <DaveMethvin> whoa, -619 ... nice going orkel!
[09:17:36] <gibson042> presumably for the same reason someone wants a selector like `[attr="\\"]`: to make us PAY
[09:17:40] <gibson042> wooo :D
[09:18:04] <DaveMethvin> backslasherry
[09:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: There was recently a selectedIndex=-1 bug in UI that we talked about.
[09:20:01] <DaveMethvin> oh right
[09:22:24] <gibson042> I don't get the results I expect from selectedIndex=NaN... why jQuery no fix it?!?
[09:26:53] <orkel> hey
[09:27:00] <orkel> thanks
[09:27:09] <orkel> i hope everything is in order, i fear though, there might be some cases that tests does not show
[09:27:34] <DaveMethvin> well we need moar tests then. :)
[09:28:03] <orkel> i added couple of them :-), just in case
[09:28:41] <DaveMethvin> Thanks for doing separate commits
[09:29:09] <DaveMethvin> i will squash a few of the little ones down but leave most of them because it will definitely help debugging if there are any
[09:29:16] <DaveMethvin> i need to go back and break some of mine up
[09:30:06] <orkel> it should, i find it helpful sometimes, especially with jQuery code
[11:35:49] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin opened pull request #1095: Use insertAdjacentHTML in domManip for common cases. (06master...06iAH)  02http://git.io/8o6lAg

[14:49:59] <paul_irish> what if you changed the API for animate() in 2.0
[14:51:09] <DaveMethvin> paul_irish: NEVER
[14:51:22] <DaveMethvin> rememember we need parity with 1.9
[14:51:34] <DaveMethvin> so like, wat you  have in mind
[14:52:46] <paul_irish> well
[14:52:59] <paul_irish> i'm thinking about all the ways that animate() does things "wrong"
[14:53:14] <paul_irish> * doesnt use css transitions or keyframe anims
[14:53:19] <paul_irish> * doesn't use rAF
[14:53:37] <paul_irish> * doesn't optimize positional top/left movement using transforms instead to GPU accel it
[14:54:32] <paul_irish> so perhaps changing the API wont work
[14:54:39] <paul_irish> but introducing a new one. transition() or something
[14:54:41] <DaveMethvin> could it be a plugin/
[14:54:52] <paul_irish> well rAF already is a plugin
[14:55:04] <DaveMethvin> see, already we have it sorta solved
[14:55:19] <DaveMethvin> does there need to be an api for that?
[14:55:30] <DaveMethvin> i mean, just set classes for transitions
[14:55:58] <DaveMethvin> the issue is shoehorning those semantics into the richer jquery animation semantics
[14:56:17] <DaveMethvin> and then dealing with transition complete events etc
[14:56:37] <DaveMethvin> so maybe a .transition() plugin is a good idea
[14:56:54] <paul_irish> aye
[14:56:56] <DaveMethvin> since .animate() can be left out of a custom build
[14:57:03] <paul_irish> oh word.
[14:57:04] <paul_irish> ya
[14:57:11] <paul_irish> okok sounds good.
[14:57:42] <gibson042> of note here is that gnarf designed the current implementation of animation with the possibility in mind that the internals of it could be replaced
[14:57:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah the hook points are pretty good
[14:58:25] <DaveMethvin> although if  you just wanted to use browser features like transitions it might be heavier than you need
[14:59:20] <gibson042> isn't that "the richer jquery animation semantics" that paul_irish wants to keep?
[14:59:51] <DaveMethvin> have your cake and eat it too? :D
[15:00:10] <DaveMethvin> i
[15:00:47] <DaveMethvin> (cat induced keyboard entry)
[15:02:12] <gibson042> aye
