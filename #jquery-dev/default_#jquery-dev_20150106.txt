[08:50:39] <gmauer> Hey guys, DaveMethvin mentioned in PR 1995 that there's a VM for editing docs? Where can I find this?
[08:51:19] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content#readme
[08:51:30] <DaveMethvin> gmauer: are you on a mac?
[08:51:35] <gmauer> ah thanks
[08:51:37] <gmauer> no, pc
[08:51:45] <DaveMethvin> oh boy, welcome :)
[08:52:10] <DaveMethvin> i've had issues getting that image set up on Windows
[08:52:10] <gmauer> ooh, havent' had an excuse to play with vagrant yet
[08:52:10] <DaveMethvin> but try it and let me know if that is fixed
[08:52:15] <gmauer> oh boy
[08:52:15] <gmauer> ok
[08:52:21] <DaveMethvin> if not we'll figure out another way
[08:52:30] <gmauer> ok thanks
[09:22:49] <m_gol> gmauer: PC == Windows?
[09:25:14] <gmauer> yup
[11:20:10] <JamesMGreene> m_gol gibson042 DaveMethvin markelog__ et al: any good resources on techniques for improving minification?  I know some of the obvious ones: 1 `var` per function, alias `this` if used more than once per function, use ternaries when reasonable, etc.
[11:20:10] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[11:20:15] <JamesMGreene> `read
[11:20:15] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: From scott_gonzalez, 6h 17m ago: Just added you as an owner.
[11:26:58] <JamesMGreene> Having trouble even locating blog posts about such online but it might just be the search terms I'm using...?
[11:32:49] <arthurvr> JamesMGreene: I remember reading a nice write-up on that topic. Let me search it back

[11:58:45] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: 1 `var` per function sounds like a lie.
[11:58:52] <scott_gonzalez> Everything you know is a lie ;-)
[11:58:59] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you're not using an actual minifier.
[11:59:09] <JamesMGreene> Eh?
[11:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> If you're using something like uglify, you can expect it do optimize some stuff for you.
[11:59:26] <JamesMGreene> ^ Meaning one `var` keyword per function, not one variable
[11:59:56] <scott_gonzalez> I would be shocked if uglify isn't doing that for you.
[12:00:05] <JamesMGreene> Didn't think it did
[12:00:10] <arschmitz> JamesMGreene: in general dont worry about that stuff let the minifier and gzip do their job
[12:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> That's the other thing: gzip destroys everything sane about minification.
[12:00:33] <arschmitz> yup
[12:00:34] <JamesMGreene> arschmitz: Agreed but now it's time for me to care
[12:00:55] <arschmitz> its hard to make real rules about it though
[12:01:06] <arschmitz> because its not just minification its the intercation with gzip
[12:01:49] <arschmitz> so you might get a file way smaller out of minification but then its not as compressible with gzip so end file size is actually bigger 
[12:01:58] <JamesMGreene> Uglify is not (or at least not always) reducing to onevar
[12:02:32] <dcherman> i think there's a `hoist` argument that you can provide to the mangle options that does that if i recall
[12:02:56] <dcherman> or something like that
[12:06:08] <JamesMGreene> Ah, indeed
[12:06:50] <JamesMGreene> Compression options `hoist_vars` and `unsafe` default to `false`, all others default to `true`
[12:12:40] <JamesMGreene> "this is false by default because it seems to increase the size of the output in general"
[12:12:40] <JamesMGreene> o_O
[12:13:13] <JamesMGreene> Must mean the gzip size?
[12:19:22] <dcherman> Yep - gzip optimizes away the repeated `var` declarations pretty well

[17:08:53] <gmauer> hey folks, I'm trying to create a PR for the docs. I ran vagrant up as per https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content#readme I have my own copy of the wordpress site up and running, but there seems to be no content http://content.screencast.com/users/togakangaroo/folders/Jing/media/0382ffe3-d22e-440d-ae85-190e8a6fb6a9/2015-01-06_1908.png
[17:09:04] <gmauer> am I missing something?
[17:09:26] <DaveMethvin> yep, you need to pull down api.jquery.com repo as well
[17:09:42] <DaveMethvin> just a sec
[17:09:53] <gmauer> ok where do I put it?
[17:10:36] <DaveMethvin> here you go http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/#workflow
[17:10:41] <DaveMethvin> sorry it's a big involved
[17:10:48] <DaveMethvin> but you've gotten pretty far
[17:11:06] <gmauer> ok thanks
[17:11:12] <DaveMethvin> so use api.jquery.com instead of contribute.jquery.org there
[17:11:18] <gmauer> great
[17:11:20] <gmauer> that's a good start
[17:11:54] <gmauer> wife is demanding my attention. I'll have to be back to this later tonight. but thanks
