[11:26:48] <JamesMGreene> Sooooo.... jzaefferer Krinkle|detached gnarf scott_gonzalez: Seeing as this QUnit PR https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/408 is not getting merged [soon], I'm going to break it into multiple commits so the changes are easier to review [and so I can keep working on improving it].  If you want the commits squashed after review or *shudder* made into separate PRs, let me know. =)
[11:26:48] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: Pull request #408 by JamesMGreene (2w 20h 52m 34s): QUnit Composite - First round of major cleanup
[11:52:06] <JamesMGreene> BTW, scott_gonzalez and DaveMethvin, re: our conversation the other day about setting `window.location`
[11:52:26] <JamesMGreene> Here's a weird note in IE's docs that explains it, though I honestly don't know what it means
[11:52:31] <JamesMGreene> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/ms535866(v=vs.85).aspx
[11:52:39] <JamesMGreene> "The href property contains the entire URL, while the other properties contain portions of the URL. The default property for the location object is location.href. For example, setting location='http://microsoft.com' is equivalent to setting location.href='http://microsoft.com'."
[11:52:59] <JamesMGreene> WTF is a default property? o_O
[11:53:13] <JamesMGreene> Must be a setter function?
[14:59:33] <JamesMGreene> There isn't any way to remove a lifecycle logging callback for QUnit, right?

[15:28:29] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: correct
[21:33:32] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer scott_gonzalez gnarf Krinkle|detached: Any tips on how to approach testing QUnit with QUnit? I want to write a legitimate test suite for QUnit Composite... the one we use today barely scratches the surface
[21:34:12] <JamesMGreene> P.S. My QUnit PR is now broken up into 10 commits for easier digestion https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/408

[21:37:58] <JamesMGreene> (And yes, I am looking at https://github.com/jquery/qunit/blob/master/test/test.js for inspiration)
[21:43:00] <JamesMGreene> Mighty dead room today :-|
