[08:33:36] <leobalter> sure. My next goal is to land that nested modules PR, I would like to hear from JamesMGreene as he also did another PR with the same topic.
[08:34:29] <leobalter> with the nested modules PR, I believe the only major thing we would have to be ready for long waited QUnit 2 is a proper reporter for node.
