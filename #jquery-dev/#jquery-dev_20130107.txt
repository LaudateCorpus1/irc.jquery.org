[05:20:01] <mikesherov> kswedberg: no, I don't :-\
[05:20:35] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1115/files#r2563997
[05:21:07] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: if you keep the regex you have to keep the string, right?
[05:21:20] <DaveMethvin> it can't be split into a module
[05:21:27] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: event.type, no?
[05:21:36] <DaveMethvin> OH
[05:21:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[05:21:48] <mikesherov> :-)
[05:21:55] <DaveMethvin> i was hoping to use MouseEvent tho because it handles situations that the strings don't
[05:22:08] <DaveMethvin> we miss some events that don't start mouse or key
[05:22:33] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: well, this is something that we should catch in 1.9 with the regex
[05:22:43] <mikesherov> and use MouseEvent for in 2.0, right?
[05:23:12] <mikesherov> Seems like ability to exclude a module should be something that we backport if we can, right?
[05:23:32] <DaveMethvin> if we can
[05:23:37] <mikesherov> I mean, I don't *really* think it's that important
[05:23:42] <mikesherov> but it's certainly doable
[05:23:47] <DaveMethvin> but it doesn't bother me that 2.0 can be more modular
[05:23:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[05:23:59] <DaveMethvin> i think the key here is that it could be done lazy
[05:24:03] <DaveMethvin> in both versions
[05:24:09] <mikesherov> right!
[05:24:36] <DaveMethvin> there were several other improvements that could be made but they would potentially change semantics
[05:24:43] <DaveMethvin> of things like fixHooks
[05:24:55] <DaveMethvin> which i suspect woudl break someone's code
[05:25:05] <mikesherov> right, and rwaldron's point about cross iframe scares me
[05:25:19] <DaveMethvin> events work only kinda across iframes
[05:25:27] <mikesherov> like everything else!
[05:25:31] <DaveMethvin> right
[05:25:49] <DaveMethvin> if you attach events across iframes and then navigate inside the iframe ... memory leak
[05:25:49] <mikesherov> I think continuing to use event.type in BOTH cases though avoiding semantic changes
[05:26:13] <mikesherov> avoids*
[05:26:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah, probably safer
[05:26:37] <DaveMethvin> btw will you be able to get to those tix i mentioned last night?
[05:26:49] <DaveMethvin> i want to put out 1.9b2 tomorrow
[05:27:05] <mikesherov> OK, I'll get to them tonight then.
[05:27:27] <DaveMethvin> also, ui is getting some fails on their unit tests, can't tell if they're from core mikesherov
[05:27:38] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: probably
[05:27:40] <mikesherov> :-P
[05:27:47] <DaveMethvin> i tried tracking one of them down and just couldn't tell
[05:28:23] <mikesherov> k, I'll look there also
[05:28:33] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2198
[05:28:36] <mikesherov> lots of moving parts!
[05:28:47] <DaveMethvin> a scary number
[05:28:53] <DaveMethvin> that's 1.9 jquery-git
[05:29:30] <DaveMethvin> I think i know the cause of the effects fail, so if you could look at the others mikesherov that would be great
[05:30:05] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yeah, lots of UI relies on focus
[05:30:12] <mikesherov> and I know we changes semantics there
[05:30:15] <DaveMethvin> groan
[05:30:17] <mikesherov> makes me shudder
[05:30:33] <mikesherov> I used to think getComputedStyle was the worst
[05:30:43] <mikesherov> now I'm convinced its the focus API
[05:31:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah looks like just about all the other fails are focus related
[05:33:12] <mikesherov> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/887116
[05:37:35] <DaveMethvin> ugh mikesherov
[05:37:40] <DaveMethvin> that's the async focus issue
[05:37:45] <mikesherov> yup
[05:38:11] <mikesherov> in that focus isn't async, or is?
[05:38:29] <DaveMethvin> in ie, focus occurs async, which means the handler is called async
[05:38:39] <DaveMethvin> prior to 1.9 we didn't use the native focus() method
[05:38:49] <DaveMethvin> but in 1.9 we do to fix various event order issues
[05:39:06] <DaveMethvin> so we can go back to the old way but we'll need to wontfix those bugs we just fix
[05:39:58] <mikesherov> sounds like we should talk to scott_gonzalez and see if there is a UI workaround
[05:40:27] <scott_gonzalez> OH NO, I see my name and focus in the close proximity.
[05:40:30] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: there is but some of these tests depend on the base stuff in core
[05:40:48] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yeah, explicitly!
[05:41:06] <mikesherov> the core test literally checks the original functionality
[05:41:22] <DaveMethvin> right and expects a sync call
[05:41:35] <DaveMethvin> which we aren't guaranteeing if we use the native focus method
[05:41:48] <DaveMethvin> let me find the patch
[05:42:07] <mikesherov> link please
[05:42:13] <scott_gonzalez> Let me look at the failing tests.
[05:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well that's easy.
[05:42:29] <scott_gonzalez> We can change those tests.
[05:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> What's the effects failure?
[05:43:04] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: assuming nobody else will crash and burn out there in the real world
[05:43:13] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: effects failure may be because of color and spurious i think
[05:44:05] <gibson042> .
[05:44:07] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/b7ec6ddd45e27b54f3e094172b7eeb6949d4f71b
[05:44:16] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: People probably will, but presumably that's already happening today.
[05:44:31] <DaveMethvin> well here is our choice ...
[05:44:33] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, people have been running into these problems every day since day one, right?
[05:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> That's why we're trying to fix this.
[05:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> I think the current implementation is better.
[05:44:48] <DaveMethvin> get the focus/blur order correct, or get the focus event handler called synchronously
[05:44:53] <mikesherov> also, some backCompat failures for addBack not existingâ€¦ which is an easy patch
[05:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> I think correct order is more important.
[05:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> We can't actually patch over the async events.
[05:45:16] <scott_gonzalez> They still happen.
[05:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> Which, in my opinion, is more painful.
[05:45:48] <DaveMethvin> right, but previously it "looked" like focus fired sync because we did it ourself
[05:45:58] <scott_gonzalez> right
[05:46:10] <DaveMethvin> i will just make sure that the upgrade guide mentions this
[05:46:11] <scott_gonzalez> People will just need to update their code to match reality.
[05:46:41] <scott_gonzalez> People that really care about focus were already having problems anyway.
[05:46:43] <mikesherov> 1.9 is shaping up to be another 1.4!
[05:46:55] <mikesherov> ;-)
[05:46:57] <DaveMethvin> is that, um, good?
[05:47:01] <mikesherov> yes
[05:47:09] <mikesherov> break the bad behavior quickly
[05:47:14] <mikesherov> rip that bandaid off
[05:47:34] <DaveMethvin> welcome to the jquery 1.9 edition of , "Ow my balls!"
[05:47:41] <mikesherov> haha
[05:48:30] <mikesherov> so, tonight i'll focus on core then failuress in ui
[05:48:46] <DaveMethvin> sweet, thanks

[10:41:28] <gnarf> er --- https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1167851 with some comments
[10:45:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah that makes sense gnarf ... still wondering about type==null tho
[10:45:34] <gnarf> oh yeah
[10:45:58] <gnarf> "nullqueue" is okay
[10:46:04] <gnarf> but the queue === won't work
[10:46:22] <DaveMethvin> but type is set to "fx" if it was null, isn't it?
[10:46:54] <gnarf> if i change that
[10:46:58] <gnarf> to allow null through there
[10:47:00] <gnarf> it works
[10:47:03] <gnarf> "nullqueue" is okay
[10:47:15] <DaveMethvin> imma name all my queues "null" :D
[10:48:41] <DaveMethvin> so can you put together a few unit tests for that gnarf? there's one in my pull that you can start from if you want
[10:49:34] <gibson042> DaveMethvin I approve of orkel's https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1117
[10:50:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah it does make sense to reverse it gibson042, at first i was hesitant
[10:50:22] <DaveMethvin> but looking at how we use it, seems reasonable
[10:50:49] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/commit/7ad3c34 has the type is null
[10:51:33] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: +137 gzip
[10:51:38] <DaveMethvin> ah ok gnarf, so null is a wildcard ... i didn't get that
[10:52:02] <gnarf> actually
[10:52:03] <gnarf> wait
[10:52:05] <gnarf> its false
[10:52:12] <gnarf> false is the meaningful one
[10:52:41] <DaveMethvin> good thing they don't charge us by the commit hash, we'd be broke! :D
[10:52:45] <gnarf> :)
[10:53:20] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: its pretty big imo
[10:53:39] <DaveMethvin> what's the final damage?
[10:53:47] <gnarf> 135
[10:53:50] <gnarf> gz
[10:53:50] <DaveMethvin> ouch
[10:53:59] <DaveMethvin> but it's pretty useful imo
[10:54:03] <gnarf> unless gibson042 wants to push some magic up on top of it
[10:54:14] <DaveMethvin> well you know he'll do that eventually
[10:54:21] <gibson042> :)
[10:54:22] <DaveMethvin> for now i'll be happy if it's functional and bug free
[10:54:52] <DaveMethvin> maybe it's just b/c you're scratching one of my itches but i always wanted this
[10:55:33] <DaveMethvin> plus right now there isn't much in the features dept for 1.9
[10:55:38] <DaveMethvin> just css array getter
[10:56:16] <gibson042> it looks pretty tight right now, I doubt it's possible to get this under +100
[10:56:27] <DaveMethvin> and this isn't really something someone would do as a plugin, needs to know a lot about internals
[10:56:36] <DaveMethvin> so i guess i'm okay with it
[10:56:38] <gibson042> that's the clincher for me
[10:57:24] <DaveMethvin> gnarf just add a few unit tests and we'll call it done
[10:57:42] <DaveMethvin> we can trim the fat elsewhere
[10:59:18] <DaveMethvin> actually, instead of type==null that can just be !type since all the other falsy cases are accounted for
[11:08:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery/commit/8ced933dd45ee2a9690694728bc26bf09e0a2ed9#L0R538
[11:08:41] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: not sure what null would be
[11:09:01] <gnarf> if its null its "fx" by convention
[11:09:49] <DaveMethvin> in the latest example, it looks like type will either be false, "fx", or some other non-empty string
[11:10:02] <DaveMethvin> or am i missing something gnarf
[11:10:10] <DaveMethvin> it's set up at the top of finish()
[11:11:53] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: that seems what it should be
[11:12:00] <gnarf> null/undefined are "fx"
[11:12:05] <gnarf> what would you pass null for?
[11:12:36] <gnarf> found another edge
[11:12:46] <DaveMethvin> on 556 there is a check for type==null but i don't see how it can ever be null
[11:13:00] <gnarf> fair
[11:13:03] <gnarf> copy pasta
[11:13:05] <gnarf> thanks
[11:13:05] <gnarf> :)
[11:13:33] <DaveMethvin> so it should be type==false but i think !type works too
[11:13:38] <DaveMethvin> ===
[11:14:20] <gnarf> man, that added 7 more bytes
[11:14:23] <gnarf> removing that code
[11:14:24] <gnarf> lol
[11:14:38] <DaveMethvin> damn you gzip!
[11:14:46] <gnarf> nah, if type == false, you wanna test that false is .queue
[11:14:53] <gnarf> so the other edge
[11:14:58] <gnarf> is in custom queue functions
[11:15:04] <gnarf> if it's already running
[11:15:13] <gnarf> there's no way to pass the "finish" along right now
[11:15:36] <DaveMethvin> oh like if the current animation is a custom?
[11:18:11] <gnarf> yeah
[11:19:50] <gnarf> fixed it with 20 bytes
[11:19:59] <gnarf> might be able to actually reduce a little 
[11:20:32] <gnarf> nope
[11:20:33] <gnarf> can't
[11:20:37] <gnarf> boo
[11:20:55] <DaveMethvin> poor gzip, nobody understands him
