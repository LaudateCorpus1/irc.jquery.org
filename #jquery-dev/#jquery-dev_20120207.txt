[00:19:41] <dilltm> hey guys
[00:20:49] <dilltm> i hav a problem with: .append('<a href="javascript:imgmodalz.contactwithimg(ed)" class="btn imgcont" id="contwithimg" style="position:absolute; left:'+(((498-$(imageData.image).width())/2)+6)+'px; top:'+(((496-$(imageData.image).height())/2)+4)+'px;">Inquire</a>')
[00:20:49] <dilltm> 			
[00:20:59] <dilltm> i want to have .contactwithimg("ed")
[00:21:13] <dilltm> but when i try .append('<a href="javascript:imgmodalz.contactwithimg("ed")" class="btn imgcont" id="contwithimg" style="position:absolute; left:'+(((498-$(imageData.image).width())/2)+6)+'px; top:'+(((496-$(imageData.image).height())/2)+4)+'px;">Inquire</a>')
[00:21:13] <dilltm> 			
[00:21:30] <dilltm> the hyperlink just goes to imgmodalz.contactwithimg(
[00:21:43] <dilltm> when i use a number it does imgmodalz.contactwithimg(1)
[00:21:48] <dilltm> and works
[00:21:52] <dilltm> but n e thing else does not
[00:22:31] <dilltm> i really want to do
[00:23:00] <dilltm> 			.append('<a href="javascript:imgmodalz.contactwithimg('+$(imageData.image).attr("src")+')" class="btn imgcont" id="contwithimg" style="position:absolute; left:'+(((498-$(imageData.image).width())/2)+6)+'px; top:'+(((496-$(imageData.image).height())/2)+4)+'px;">Inquire</a>')
[00:23:00] <dilltm> 			
[00:23:10] <dilltm> and pass a whole image-path
[01:20:09] <matjas>  http://jsfiddle.net/EPwGh/ — when using `.on('foo', fn)` → `fn` doesn’t get called when .triggerHandler('foo.someNameSpace') is used
[01:20:22] <matjas> is that intentional?
[01:30:30] <matjas> nvm, trigger doesn’t do that either, my bad
[01:35:00] <Eviltwin> Have you read this page? http://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/
[05:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Got some time for a quick chat re: MSPointer today?
[05:27:18] <bot-t> (7 hours 52 mins ago) <kborchers> tell scott_gonzalez you might be interested in this https://github.com/danheberden/easing.js
[05:27:50] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: sounds good, i saw their email
[05:28:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'd like to respond to it today, but I wanted to make sure we're on the same page first :-)
[05:29:35] <DaveMethvin> how about 30 minutes from now? that give the coffee some time to kick in :D
[06:10:52] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: so now?
[07:13:01] <gibson042> can you send over your config file(s)? I got connection refused from port 8001 and a seemingly infinite loop after "Logging in to API" on port 8000
[07:13:20] <gibson042> aarg; n/m
[08:10:22] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: relative to docs#10174 and its endless stream of duplicates, any thoughts on changing data- attribute parsing for 2.0?
[08:10:24] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, [#10174] data attributes with large integers don't work (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/10174
[08:10:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah we're in a real pickle on that one aren't we gibson042
[08:11:09] <DaveMethvin> screwed no matter what we do
[08:11:21] <DaveMethvin> i think Mobile depends on the data conversions
[08:12:27] <gibson042> a middle road would be undoing conversion if the output isn't string-equal with the input
[08:12:57] <gibson042> or, since it would be changing with a major release, them's just the breaks
[08:13:13] <DaveMethvin> well, "false" is true :D
[08:13:16] <DaveMethvin> that's quite a break
[08:13:39] <DaveMethvin> the string-equal thing is an interesting solution
[08:13:47] <DaveMethvin> really just numbers
[08:14:11] <DaveMethvin> but it might get annoying since the type would vary
[08:14:46] <gibson042> the only issue there would be bugs about data-number="1.2" vs. data-string="1.20"
[08:15:27] <gibson042> because the complaint right now is that type varies
[08:15:38] <DaveMethvin> i dunno, if it were a year ago i'd suggest backing it all out, in fact i did
[08:15:55] <DaveMethvin> but now i think we'd break more stuff by changing it
[08:16:13] <DaveMethvin> and applying more magic (e.g., string-equal) is probably the wrong direction
[08:16:30] <DaveMethvin> magic always gets us in trouble :)
[08:16:34] <gibson042> I guess that makes sense, since the resolution on all of these is just "act like .data ignores those attributes" anyway
[08:16:41] <gibson042> yep
[08:17:07] <DaveMethvin> really the problem is that people expect .data() to set/get data- attributes in the first place
[08:17:14] <DaveMethvin> but we were there first!
[08:17:30] <DaveMethvin> we shoudl have made the w3c use stuff- as the prefix
[08:17:36] <DaveMethvin> then everybody would not be confused
[08:18:16] <danzik17> what about providing a public "converter" function that defaults to a no-op or something - you can provide a plugin that would re-introduce the current behavior
[08:19:24] <DaveMethvin> it really depends on who depends on which behavior, i know there must be people who expect the conversion behavior now and we'd be breaking their code
[08:20:02] <DaveMethvin> and no matter what people will incorrectly assume a direct correspondence between .data() and data- attributes
[08:20:42] <DaveMethvin> the only thing we do is load .data() based on data- attributes the first time, otherwise they are not connected and setting via .data() never sets data- attributes
[08:21:08] <DaveMethvin> but other than using a larger font on api.jquery.com/data i am not sure how to fix that :)
[08:39:52] <scott_gonzalez> The problem with data-number="1.2" and data-string="1.20" is that we don't use JSON for the conversion.
[08:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> data-string="'1.20'" // yay
[08:52:01] <gibson042> looking at dataAttr, I think maybe we can change the condition from `jQuery.isNumeric(data)` to `rnum.test(data) && isFinite(data)`
[08:53:04] <gibson042> we'd still have long strings of numbers get rounded in the float conversion, but '4e2' would no longer become '400'
[09:57:59] <ralphholzmann> back
[10:00:54] <ralphholzmann> back
[11:53:16] <mikesherov> anyone home?
