[10:18:32] <Jayflux> Why have .success and .error changed to .done and .fail?
[14:08:52] <timmywil> lol, rwaldron just linked to the docs on wont_fix

[14:13:54] <tbranyen> xD
[17:55:40] <timmywil> OK, experiment complete
[17:55:50] <timmywil> I should write this up
[17:56:02] <timmywil> qwery is not viable as a selector engine for jQuery
[17:56:07] <timmywil> https://github.com/timmywil/qwery/commit/16c98ff0635fcb0205aac917fa575f27c99647ec
[17:56:08] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on qwery by timmywil (43m, 3s ago): This was a very valuable exercise, but qwery is not a viable selector engine for jQuery for many reasons (see below).- The chunker cannot handle multiple pseudos or attribute selectors. Supporting this would require a complete rewrite of the engine.  qwery tries to split up a selection all at once and passes the parts to the interpret function, which is great but makes it impossi
[17:56:08] <socialhapy> equire a more complex filter and are a good argument for adding prefilters in order to do things like :nth-child(2n+1) or :nth-child(-n+6), which qwery cannot do- qwery would need very similar code to that which Sizzle uses to sort nodes based on document order when selectors contain commas.- Sizzle handles about 1000 more edge cases and is much more bulletproof.- Positional pseudo selectors like :eq or :first require differe
[17:56:08] <socialhapy> fter the full selection is complete (and as stated before, qwery can only handle one pseudo in a selection)- Adding support for :not would probably mean spilling code into every function.- qwery required some restructuring to work with jQuery as well as matchesSelector to pass at least 50% of the jQuery tests.- __Main point:__ qwery would undoubtedly have to look a lot more like Sizzle, but I think we can learn a lot from qwe
[17:56:09] <socialhapy>  Thanks qwery!
