[09:09:16] <magistr> <ajpiano> But I can But I can ask questions on jquery here?
[09:09:20] <ajpiano> no.
[09:09:28] <magistr> why?
[09:09:36] <ajpiano> this channel is only for discussion of development of jQuery itself, not support with the library

[09:40:47] <jzaefferer> if you read just the last nine messages, it looks like two bots are "fighting"
[09:41:55] <ajpiano> lol
[09:42:15] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: magistr here has been quite troublesom and i'm sort of hoping he'll just exhaust himself
[09:42:56] <Jakey> funny
[09:47:05] <jonathansampson> Wow, trolling in the jQuery dev channel? I wouldnt have expected that,

[09:51:34] <ajpiano> otherwise it's kind of like letting a grenade sit around
[09:51:58] <ajpiano> i tend to try not to act too quickly :p
