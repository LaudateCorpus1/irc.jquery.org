[06:12:12] <doesallmagic> Scott Gonz√°lez: Clear filter and testNumber when choosing a module. Fixes #442.
[06:39:55] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, 2.0.0-beta3 doesn't adhere to semver, it should be 2.0.0-beta.3
[06:40:16] <DaveMethvin> orly?
[06:40:26] <DaveMethvin> well i got the dash part right
[06:40:39] <m_gol> ;)
[07:06:26] <m_gol> only 2 prs, nice job!
[07:07:56] <gibson042> DaveMethvin let me know when you're all set so we can reference a Sizzle tag instead of a commit hash... I'm thinking 1.9.2, since there's no way to match jQuery 1.x and 2.x with a single Sizzle version anyway
[07:16:22] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 can we do that? I think we always referenced the hash in the past
[07:16:38] <DaveMethvin> oh also, the source map
[07:16:55] <gibson042> we have always referenced the hash, but it'd be kind of nice for Sizzle to be more independent, like qunit
[07:17:04] <gibson042> yes, I'm working on the source map now
[07:17:09] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks
[07:17:40] <DaveMethvin> honestly i've thought about switching to a copy of the file for qunit, submodules are kind of a paint
[07:19:52] <gibson042> fair enough
[07:20:37] <gibson042> but it'd still be nice to ref "v1.9.2" instead of "26d2cef803e613fcab99d049c1f947340af968f5"
[07:20:48] <DaveMethvin> agreed

[09:27:23] <JamesMGreene> [08:39] <m_gol> DaveMethvin, 2.0.0-beta3 doesn't adhere to semver, it should be 2.0.0-beta.3
[09:27:25] <JamesMGreene> Really?
[09:27:28] <JamesMGreene> Thought it did
[09:28:19] <DaveMethvin> the regex i was using in the release script was intended to be a subset of full semver, but i may have gotten it wrong
[09:29:25] <JamesMGreene> Oh
[09:29:35] <JamesMGreene> Well
[09:29:47] <JamesMGreene> semver 1.0 shows your same type of example, e.g. "alpha1"
[09:29:57] <JamesMGreene> but semver 2.0.0rc shows "alpha.1"
[09:30:08] <JamesMGreene> thought it does NOT say the period is required so far as I can see
[09:30:19] <DaveMethvin> it doesn't really matter if we adhere to semver syntax since we aren't adhering to semver semanticss :)
[09:30:40] <JamesMGreene> lol
[09:30:58] <JamesMGreene> patch version? break all the thing
[09:31:00] <JamesMGreene> s
[09:31:16] <m_gol> hmm, right
[09:31:29] <m_gol> 10. A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a dash and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers MUST be comprised of only ASCII alphanumerics and dash [0-9A-Za-z-]. Pre-release versions satisfy but have a lower precedence than the associated normal version. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92.
[09:31:39] <m_gol> according to this alpha1 would be ok
[09:31:46] <m_gol> but all examples they give have a dot
[09:32:20] <JamesMGreene> the dot makes sense to me but, yeah, not required
[09:32:27] <DaveMethvin> right since it's an alphanumeric
[09:33:43] <m_gol> well, to be honest, beta3 looks nicer to me than beta.3
[09:33:43] <m_gol> but
[09:33:51] <m_gol> it seems less semantically correct
[09:34:00] <DaveMethvin> probably not in the "spirit" since it's really a sequence number for a beta ... beta.1, beta.2 etc
[09:34:02] <m_gol> because in a very weird case when we have 11 betas
[09:34:13] <m_gol> beta10 would be before beta9
[09:34:25] <DaveMethvin> if we have 11 betas we're doing it rong
[09:34:26] <m_gol> because they'd be compared as strings
[09:34:27] <DaveMethvin> :D
[09:34:29] <m_gol> ;)
[09:34:43] <m_gol> "this time it HAS TO go well" :D
[09:36:08] <m_gol> I like where the compression's going!
[09:36:17] <DaveMethvin> so on orkel's pull, imma land that and start testing
[09:36:36] <DaveMethvin> the only thing left is the map file stuff gibson042 is working on
[09:36:47] <DaveMethvin> and that shouldn't affect execution
[09:39:17] <DaveMethvin> zowie, 29035 min/gz!
[09:39:48] <m_gol> :)
[09:40:08] <DaveMethvin> gonna run a few tests here before pushing
[09:43:11] <DaveMethvin> orkel, were you able to get the test to run in ie6/7/8?
[09:43:20] <DaveMethvin> i'm getting errors almost immediately
[09:43:33] <DaveMethvin> seems fine in chrome of course :D
[09:43:49] <DaveMethvin> oh DUH
[09:43:58] <DaveMethvin> sorry, master not 1.x master
[09:43:58] <snover> sizzle guarantees document order right?
[09:44:08] <DaveMethvin> or your money back, snover
[09:44:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:44:14] <snover> thought so
[09:44:36] <DaveMethvin> void where disconnected
[09:44:55] <snover> you‚Äôre so clever today
[09:45:11] <DaveMethvin> 2.0 is coming to town
[09:45:23] <m_gol> haha, I imagine on master there are a few minor issues in IE6-8 :D
[09:45:24] <orkel> DaveMethvin yes! Of course i did
[09:45:38] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:45:50] <DaveMethvin> okay i'm a moron
[09:45:58] <orkel> m_gol :-)
[09:47:20] <DaveMethvin> well i seem to be getting the same fails i was getting before in ie10 so that is good
[09:48:00] <m_gol> some unit tests almost always fail for me at 1st attempt
[09:48:04] <m_gol> and are OK at second
[09:48:09] <m_gol> e.g. focusin tests in Firefox
[09:48:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:48:16] <m_gol> and some tests in IE9-10
[09:48:31] <m_gol> but if I repeat the failed ones, I was able to get all pass in IE9-10
[09:48:31] <orkel> m_gol what are those?
[09:48:39] <DaveMethvin> once we have swarmy back i am gonna go through and either fix or remove failing tets
[09:49:01] <DaveMethvin> i'd rather have something not covered than a false alarm every run
[09:49:49] <DaveMethvin> in ie10 i am getting the focus fails, which will go away when i rerun
[09:50:06] <DaveMethvin> and some ajax fails that are probably an issue with my localhost setup
[09:50:20] <DaveMethvin> i've seen them before
[09:50:42] <orkel> DaveMethvin the same ones that in FF?
[09:50:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:51:43] <orkel> it would worry me if it was not focus stuff
[09:51:43] <DaveMethvin> i think github is a bit flakey today
[09:52:00] <DaveMethvin> about 5 ajax tests, let me just rerun ajax
[09:52:28] <m_gol> orkel:
[09:52:28] <m_gol> event: focus-blur order (#12868) (1, 3, 4)Rerun826 ms
[09:52:28] <m_gol>     Expected 5 assertions, but 3 were run
[09:52:28] <m_gol>     Source: 	
[09:52:28] <m_gol>     @http://jquery.l/test/unit/event.js:2344
[09:52:29] <m_gol> event: Check order of focusin/focusout events (1, 0, 1)Rerun25 ms
[09:52:29] <m_gol>     Expected 2 assertions, but 0 were run
[09:52:30] <m_gol>     Source: 	
[09:52:39] <m_gol>     @http://jquery.l/test/unit/event.js:2642
[09:52:40] <m_gol> on current master
[09:52:57] <DaveMethvin> but those happened before and are pretty well understood
[09:53:22] <DaveMethvin> the ones failing for me now in ie10 are ajax: jQuery.ajax() - success callbacks (4, 4, 8)
[09:53:33] <m_gol> this is weird because it seems tests don't fail but assertions are not run
[09:53:44] <DaveMethvin> yes, they don't hapen
[09:53:51] <DaveMethvin> because the focus event isn't delivered
[09:53:57] <m_gol> ah, right
[09:54:15] <DaveMethvin> so i just pushed the changes to master
[09:54:19] <m_gol> and there is one failing test on stable Chrome, fixed in Canary
[09:54:20] <DaveMethvin> if you guys can pull and rebuild
[09:54:30] <DaveMethvin> let me know if you see anything
[09:54:36] <m_gol> ok
[09:55:04] <orkel> sure thing
[09:55:13] <DaveMethvin> the bot didn't announce it tho...strange
[09:55:26] <m_gol> maybe he's the one failing test
[09:55:34] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #795: STILL FAILING in 4 min 53 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/795/
[09:55:35] <doesallmagic> Dave Methvin: Change uglify compression options, close gh-1245.
[09:56:02] <DaveMethvin> something changed there b/c it used to have the authors name and not the committers
[09:56:10] <DaveMethvin> oh well
[09:56:30] <m_gol> yeah, it's been for some time now this way, gnarf noticed it, too
[10:00:14] <m_gol> as for those sometimes failing tests, the test suite could record those ones and re-run them with one by one at the end maybe
[10:00:45] <DaveMethvin> swarmy will re-run failing modules twice i think
[10:00:59] <DaveMethvin> to get a good run
[10:01:53] <m_gol> IE9 hangs on Sizzle tests for me on master~1
[10:02:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah, give it time
[10:02:12] <DaveMethvin> also it seems that it runs faster when done by itself
[10:02:50] <DaveMethvin> so if you get all the way to sizzle, bail out and run it again with just sizzle
[10:03:07] <m_gol> ah, went through
[10:03:09] <m_gol> ok, so now master
[10:10:21] <m_gol> IE9 clear for me on the minified file
[10:23:46] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: wanna look over https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1246 ?
[10:23:46] <b-ot> gibson042: Pull request #1246 by gibson042 (1m 31s ago): Fix #13776: Add banner before generating source map
[10:24:03] <DaveMethvin> you got it
[10:25:12] <m_gol> IE9-10, Firefox, Opera all clear, Chrome almost clear (with this one fail on iteration over document.styleSheets)
[10:25:19] <m_gol> so everything seems fine
[10:25:32] <DaveMethvin> m_gol do you run adblock?
[10:25:34] <m_gol> and Safari 6 clear
[10:25:43] <m_gol> ahh
[10:25:45] <m_gol> :D
[10:25:47] <DaveMethvin> turn it off for localhost
[10:25:47] <m_gol> right...
[10:28:03] <m_gol> yeah, now it passes them all. so that was it...
[10:30:16] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 i imagine you writing this with tears in your eyes
[10:30:38] <gibson042> and a pint of ice cream in hand
[10:30:44] <m_gol> orkel: I was mainly thinking about stuff like:
[10:30:44] <m_gol> var a = function b(){}
[10:30:48] <DaveMethvin> lool ri right
[10:31:15] <DaveMethvin> well it'll have to do until that bug gets fixed
[10:33:53] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure glad i didn't try to put sourcemaps into jquery-migrate
[10:34:21] <gibson042> lol
[10:34:22] <m_gol> :)
[10:35:03] <DaveMethvin> gibson042 seems good enough for now, if you can land that would be awesome
[10:35:09] <m_gol> gtg, good luck with the blog post
[10:35:10] <DaveMethvin> i'm working on the blog post
[10:35:16] <DaveMethvin> yep
[10:35:29] <DaveMethvin> mostly rehash from previous ones
[10:35:39] <DaveMethvin> the changelog is a pain tho
[10:36:28] <orkel> m_gol in this context, there is no difference between your example and mine, it's still leaking in oldIE
[10:36:40] <m_gol> ah, ok
[10:36:56] <m_gol> so, I was thinking that some optimizations might potentially break oldIE in such cases
[10:37:02] <m_gol> dunno, maybe I'm wrong
[10:37:09] <m_gol> but we don't have to care for 2.x anywa
[10:37:11] <m_gol> y
[10:37:15] <DaveMethvin> yay!

[11:08:38] <chuwiey> hi all, i know this isn't the right channel for it, but no one on #jquery was answering, and this is a 'expert' question (i think)
[11:09:29] <chuwiey> I am passing a 200 ok through the callback to $.ajaxTransport but the ajax call is failing
[11:09:34] <chuwiey> any ideas?
[12:20:27] <m_gol> you should ask on stackoverflow

[13:32:32] <DaveMethvin> any others as well, comments welcome
[13:40:33] <JamesMGreene> DaveMethvin: I'm surprised you don't comment on the difference in file size between 1.9.x and 2.0.0 :)
[13:40:46] <JamesMGreene> (like showing the numbers)
[13:40:47] <DaveMethvin> i say "10 percent"
[13:41:07] <JamesMGreene> oh hai there it is
[13:41:15] <JamesMGreene> I'm surprised it was only 10%
[13:42:36] <DaveMethvin> well actually with the real numbers in there it's almost 12%
[13:42:40] <DaveMethvin> so i'll update it
[13:48:40] <JamesMGreene> What's the largest module that can be excluded in a custom build?
[13:48:57] <DaveMethvin> probably either ajax or sizzle
[13:49:11] <DaveMethvin> i think sizzle is about 6kb min/gz
[13:49:29] <DaveMethvin> but of course then you have to use the sucky minimal selector engine

[14:42:50] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[14:43:25] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i think they are called google chrome apps

[14:43:50] <DaveMethvin> "Google Chrome add-ons"
[14:44:31] <gibson042> I updated the sizzle package.json and component.json, but forgot that timmywil added the build files to the repo
[14:45:24] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: so Sizzle tag 1.9.2 dist/*.js advertise theirselves as v1.9.2-pre

[14:59:28] <ajpiano> i does what i do
[15:01:12] <ajpiano> lol we are blowin up twitter w/ the news
[15:01:24] <DaveMethvin> sho nuff
[15:34:45] <gibson042> DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez what's the best way to fix Sizzle AUTHORS.txt for https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/205 ? should I just copy the jQuery .mailmap and `grunt authors > AUTHORS.txt`?
[15:34:45] <b-ot> gibson042: Issue #205 by dmethvin (31m 14s ago): Update AUTHORS.txt for recently landed commits
[15:35:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah it seems like we'll have some duplication in .mailmap eh?
[15:35:38] <DaveMethvin> i think there are only a few new entries to be added, you can probalby just add them to your list
[15:35:45] <gibson042> let me put it this way: things come out worse if I don't include that step
[15:36:01] <DaveMethvin> lol
[15:36:11] <DaveMethvin> well in that case, include it
[15:36:16] <gibson042> looks like 7 new entries and a comparable number of name changes
[15:36:27] <DaveMethvin> oh that many?
[15:37:33] <ajpiano> hey, #1 on hackernews
[15:38:03] <gibson042> Andrew Chalkley ‚Üí chalkers; Fabio Buffoni ‚Üí +LosTFx; Riccardo De Agostini ‚Üí rdeago; etc.
[15:38:29] <gibson042> plus new emails for snover & kswedberg
[15:38:49] <DaveMethvin> gotta run sorry
[15:39:09] <gibson042> np; I'm just gonna go with it
[15:44:23] <snover> emails for me
[15:44:27] <snover> ?!

[15:45:24] <sizcommit> 13sizzle/06master 14a067a1f 15Richard Gibson: Updating to 1.9.4-pre
[15:46:39] <gibson042> snover: yep. github.com@ to colin@ (per .mailmap)
[15:48:42] <snover> um
[15:48:43] <snover> do not ever
[15:48:44] <snover> publish
[15:48:45] <snover> colin@
[15:48:46] <snover> ever.
[15:48:51] <snover> if you do i will hunt you down and murder you 
[15:48:58] <snover> i realise it is already everywhere
[15:49:01] <snover> but everywhere+1 is no good
[15:49:09] <snover> and i will murder you
[15:49:10] <snover> the end
[15:49:26] <gibson042> do you want them reversed in the jQuery & Sizzle mailmaps?
[15:50:17] <snover> are you saying somewhere i committed something with my personal email address? somewhere maybe i submitted something with a bogus email address because i hadn‚Äôt set up git properly
[15:50:38] <gibson042> it looks that way
[15:51:26] <snover> github.com is the correct one, the other one is bogus
[15:51:29] <snover> and I am a big failure
[15:51:32] <snover> how does git work
[15:52:47] <ajpiano> it's like a vector hilbert space something of the project joke that everyone already knows
[15:52:50] <snover> it would be helpful for git noobs for git to reject commits if you haven‚Äôt set your global email instead of going ‚Äúoh, i bet your username @ hostname is the correct email address for you‚Äù
[15:53:15] <snover> when is that *ever* someone‚Äôs real email address?
[15:53:17] <snover> never.
[15:53:40] <gibson042> I strongly agree
[15:54:29] <gibson042> my first commit was credited to someone else because I used a technically-invalid <@gmail.com> that was already claimed at github
[15:57:28] <gibson042> because for some bizarre-as-hell reason, GH authenticates by public key but associates by email address
[16:14:40] <Oria1024756> Someone willing to help me with what is a probably a very basic question?  I am stuck on some logic and I am trying to hide some div content and show another when their respective tabs are clicked.  I can't seem to work it out.
[16:14:58] <Oria1024756> my code is here if someone is willing to help me through it http://pastebin.com/FDgfMHJU
[16:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: That mailmap commit reverted some names.
[17:02:20] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: here now
[17:03:03] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i think doesallmagic reports committer, but the github bot(when it works) shows author
[17:10:05] <gibson042> scott_gonzalez: are you saying that the mailmap is wrong, or grunt-git-authors?
[17:29:42] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: do we have any evidence to support "faster" (from the facebook post)
[17:29:53] <gnarf> helping richard with his talk slides
[17:30:06] <gnarf> don't wanna just fluff it, whats the support for that claim?
[17:30:06] <DaveMethvin> short answer, no
[17:30:26] <DaveMethvin> i did some tests a while back but don't have any results to share
[17:30:41] <DaveMethvin> i'd have to dig up the results and review them to see if they're non-bogus
[17:30:57] <DaveMethvin> i just found a regression that rwaldron fixed perfwise
[17:31:02] <gnarf> can you maybe look for a few mintues and report back, we have other things to find too
[17:31:22] <gnarf> like
[17:31:28] <gnarf> less support tests = faster onloads?
[17:31:32] <gnarf> or something like that
[17:31:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah i wish i had that
[17:31:52] <DaveMethvin> siovene was working on something but i haven't heard from him in a while
[17:39:34] <philfreo> I tried to submit this in the jQuery bug tracker but it says my password is invalid and I haven‚Äôt received the forgotten password link :(  Bug shows difference in behavior between 2.0.0 and 1.9.1 in Chrome: http://jsfiddle.net/philfreo/7gUBk/
[17:40:05] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: The mailmap is missing some entries.
[17:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> For example https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/commit/204ddda92ba3de51b4b870b2011de7b8d7250458#L1R5
[17:40:29] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Richard Gibson (1h 58m ago): Tagging 1.9.3
[17:40:29] <DaveMethvin> philfreo perhaps a bug in sinon?
[17:41:07] <philfreo> DaveMethvin: possibly, will follow up there to investigate more but wanted to report it ASAP in case it was a jquery bug (since there weren't supposed to be any real changes since 1.9.1)
[17:41:39] <DaveMethvin> philfreo certainly not in documented interfaces; i'm not familiar with sinon to know what it is doing
[17:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: If you want, I can go through the authors and add/edit whatever needs to change in the mailmap. Just let me know if you want me to do it.

[22:23:24] <Krinkle> gnarf: Looks like I'm unable to ssh to eol3. docs.jquery.com is on eol3, is it not?
[22:23:35] <Krinkle> couldn't find anything in the infra repo either
[22:23:48] <Krinkle> afaik it is a jqadmin server, but I'm getting permission denied on it
[22:24:04] <Krinkle> perhaps it is using my old ssh key still?
[22:24:09] <Krinkle> I changed it a few months ago

[23:50:45] <gnarf> Krinkle: you should have krinkle@ there i think
[23:50:48] <gnarf> if not, you might have to add your ssh_user to the realizes on that box
[23:50:51] <gnarf> the eol[1-3] servers are all setup on puppet
[23:50:53] <gnarf> users wise
[23:50:56] <gnarf> there MAY be a jqadmin@ but you should just setup krinkle@
[23:51:09] <Krinkle> yeah, I'll add myself there.
[23:52:08] <gnarf> seems they are running on the "stage" branch
[23:52:23] <gnarf> i can do this if you aren't already in the middle of doing it
[23:52:40] <gnarf> lemme just add you to the sysadmins group
[23:52:46] <gnarf> so you end up everywhere that puppet goes
[23:56:48] <Krinkle> OK, thanks :)
