[08:10:30] <addyosmani> hey guys / DaveMethvin
[08:10:44] <DaveMethvin> WHAT? im not a guy
[08:10:46] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[08:10:49] <addyosmani> :p
[08:10:50] <DaveMethvin> nope, still there
[08:10:57] <DaveMethvin> sup, addyosmani
[08:11:01] <addyosmani> It's a well-made, fake! :)
[08:11:04] <addyosmani> Sup
[08:11:06] <addyosmani> So
[08:11:13] <addyosmani> I had a question about our current support of issues with .tmpl.
[08:11:18] <DaveMethvin> ugh
[08:11:43] <addyosmani> Are we still going to take on issues with that or just say, sorz, its no longer supported until UI release theirs
[08:11:49] <DaveMethvin> i don't think we support it at all, there was a blog post about it a while back
[08:11:55] <addyosmani> yep I remember
[08:12:03] <addyosmani> Just wanted to make sure before closing. We got a ticket about it today
[08:12:11] <DaveMethvin> i don't see boris in the channel, we could ask him
[08:12:15] <DaveMethvin> but he's off doing a new impl too
[08:12:26] <DaveMethvin> so i doubt he wants to support the old one
[08:12:26] <addyosmani> that's true.
[08:12:31] <addyosmani> indeed.
[08:12:59] <addyosmani> I have a feeling we should close as wontfix or patchwelcome. If Boris or someone else want to take on the fix, they can feel free to
[08:13:25] <DaveMethvin> sounds good, someone else could fork it and continue to support if they love it so much
[08:13:37] <addyosmani> yep yep
[08:13:44] <addyosmani> btw
[08:13:55] <addyosmani> I really liked the level of depth you went into on the .on/.off docs
[08:14:03] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[08:14:16] <kswedberg> +1
[08:14:36] <DaveMethvin> just about ready to put the first draft of .off up
[08:16:52] <aaronmcadam> awesome :D
[08:46:21] <jaubourg> hi there
[08:46:22] <bot-t> (121 hours ago) <timmywil> tell jaubourg callbacks docs? http://addyosmani.com/blog/jquery-1-7s-callbacks-feature-demystified/
[08:46:22] <bot-t> (67 hours 50 mins ago) <timmywil> tell jaubourg Opera 11.51 is failing on jQuery.ajax - statusText. jqXHR.statusText === "error" instead of "World" or even Safari's "Not Found".
[08:46:22] <bot-t> (25 hours 30 mins ago) <seutje> tell jaubourg "GET YOUR OWN BLOCK"? http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/318588_2398155867030_1045008609_2759300_109229029_n.jpg
[08:46:28] <gnarf> omg
[08:46:32] * gnarf tacklehugs jaubourg
[08:46:39] <jaubourg> hey :)
[08:47:08] <jaubourg> man, I can't take vacations or so it seems
[08:47:43] <kswedberg> welcome back, jaubourg!!!!!!!
[08:48:01] <jaubourg> hey Karl
[08:48:25] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg: It's jaw-bore!!
[08:48:30] <jaubourg> I know I'm under but I'm supposedly still on vacations :P
[08:48:47] <gnarf> jaubourg: how did your EU conf stop go?
[08:48:59] <timmywil> lol jaw-bore
[08:48:59] <gnarf> or was it a training, i can't remember
[08:49:13] <jaubourg> gnarf: not bad, java devs weren't that aggressive
[08:49:21] <jaubourg> very general presentation of jQuery anyway
[08:49:46] <jaubourg> I basically raped Ben Nadel's own presentation, it was spot on most of the time
[08:50:02] <jaubourg> timmy: jaw-bore ftw
[08:50:12] <timmywil> jaubourg: we still have the ajax fail in Opera (no idea), and that article from addy is a great start for callbacks docs
[08:50:31] <timmywil> that is all
[08:50:40] <jaubourg> timmy: agreed on addy's post, I answered an email from him when he was writing it
[08:50:48] <jaubourg> what does Opera output?
[08:50:55] <timmywil> "error"
[08:51:01] <jaubourg> wtf?
[08:51:02] <timmywil> for the statusText
[08:51:08] <timmywil> not even world or not found
[08:51:43] <timmywil> and that's the only fail that isn't related to live/die or focus inputs i think
[08:52:20] <jaubourg> sounds just like Opera...
[08:54:46] <gnarf> ?swarm
[08:54:46] <bot-t> Swarm Status: http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquery/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jqueryui/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/qunit/ http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerycolor/ -- Jenkins http://swarm.jquery.org:8080
[08:54:57] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/148/
[08:55:30] <timmywil> ah yea, that stupid object one in ie9
[08:55:46] <gnarf> oh and btw, just sharing this with more of us
[08:55:46] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/f7491a188a70437dce7b
[08:55:51] <gnarf> if you ever want to unit test focus
[08:55:55] <gnarf> you should do something like this
[08:56:02] <gnarf> it avoids a few bugs
[08:56:19] <gnarf> FF wont trigger handlers on focus for elements if the page isn't focused
[08:56:29] <gnarf> and IE won't blur
[08:58:27] <timmywil> lunch bbl
[09:02:36] <jaubourg> wtf Opera, really wtf?
[09:05:21] <jaubourg> oh, now that's grand, Opera returns status 0
[09:05:28] <Rwhitbeck> is there any documentation yet on on()/off()?
[09:05:36] <addyosmani> Rwhitbeck: lots
[09:05:41] <addyosmani> DaveMethvin has them in draft
[09:05:55] <Rwhitbeck> Is it something I can look at?
[09:06:00] <DaveMethvin> NO! :P
[09:06:07] <addyosmani> .on() looks like it's almost finished. .off() I believe he's still working on pushing
[09:06:18] <DaveMethvin> Rwhitbeck: do you have access to api.jquery.com WP?
[09:06:19] <addyosmani> oh shush. what's done looks very promising.
[09:06:22] <DaveMethvin> they are in draft there
[09:06:34] <Rwhitbeck> I think
[09:08:02] <jaubourg> ok, I gotta fly
[09:09:16] <jaubourg> Opera bug for sure, status is reported as 0 within ajax... probably meaning setting a custom statusText for a 404 has poor Opera all confused... when will the madness end with xhr implementations? Do I really need to make unit tests to put devs nose into their pile of sh--?
[09:09:48] <jaubourg> frustrating and infuriating for sure
[09:10:03] <Rwhitbeck> DaveMethvin thanks I was able to take a look.
[09:10:13] <jaubourg> cya around later guys
[09:10:20] <Rwhitbeck> addyosmani lots is an understatment ;-)
[09:10:32] <addyosmani> He's been busy! :)
[09:16:48] <gnarf> Rwhitbeck: are you still podcasting ever?
[09:17:29] <Rwhitbeck> With the change of jobs I'll need to figure it out again.  I'd like to change it up a little… so short answer yes
[09:17:38] <gnarf> :)
[09:17:58] <gnarf> any update on talk videos btw?
[09:19:18] <aaronmcadam> gnarf: if ur starved for podcasts like myself, try this one http://javascriptshow.com/
[09:19:32] <Rwhitbeck> Coming slowly…I have John's keynote I need to drop into a video template then we can keep pushing out videos as they are encoded.
[09:19:53] <gnarf> Rwhitbeck: cool, was my talk one of the ones videoed? :)
[09:20:01] <Rwhitbeck> I don't know
[09:20:09] <Rwhitbeck> Luke Brookhart has the videos
[09:37:04] <Rwhitbeck> gnarf luke said he recorded Elijah's talk instead of yours
[09:37:14] <gnarf> darn
[09:37:33] <gnarf> but thats cool, i get to watch elijah's ;)
[11:47:06] <gnarf> so, i just had an idea for a site...
[11:47:29] <gnarf> to list potential breaking changes from version to version
[11:52:31] <ajpiano> who is the anonymous who is poring over the 1.7 source code right now and commenting on like
[11:52:36] <ajpiano> stylistic and commenting things
[11:53:26] <ajpiano> gnarf: donno if it needs a site, maybe just an article
[11:56:40] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7907355/is-it-safe-to-upgrade-jquery
[11:56:47] <gnarf> like i wanna be able to give this guy a solid answer
[11:56:51] <gnarf> cuz there are a few changes
[11:56:56] <gnarf> .prop / .ajax / etc
[12:05:32] <gnarf> hrm
[12:05:40] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: not that i ended up using it
[12:06:04] <gnarf> do you think returnFalse might be as useful as a $.noop?
[12:07:12] <DaveMethvin> gnarf seems like it might be although there coudl be some gotchas for such a surprisingly simple thing
[12:07:29] <DaveMethvin> like, the event system attaches a .guid property to the function
[12:07:44] <gnarf> yeah
[12:07:52] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin, no more parameter hockey https://gist.github.com/1317345
[12:07:55] <DaveMethvin> it's only a line so i wasn't gonna sweat it
[12:08:00] <ben_alman> heh
[12:09:06] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: yeah kinda oddly attractive, like a shiny red button
[12:09:23] <DaveMethvin> definitely a cute solution
[12:09:45] <ben_alman> heh
[12:09:59] <ben_alman> i'd use a $.type kind of fn for the serialization
[12:10:04] <ben_alman> or my own, better solution :P
[12:10:05] <ben_alman> but yeah
[12:10:07] <ben_alman> heh
[12:10:22] <ben_alman> it's amusing nonetheless
[12:10:58] <DaveMethvin> man these docs are never ending ...
[12:11:27] <DaveMethvin> on off bind unbind live die delegate undelegate one plus the new event properties
[12:11:45] <ben_alman> wow i rememebr when i had time to talk about jquery outside my training
[12:11:47] <gnarf> hrm
[12:11:51] <ben_alman> i need to get back in the loop
[12:11:58] <ben_alman> BUT THERE'S BATTLEFIELD TO PLAY
[12:14:05] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:04:57] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/GuROdg
[13:04:57] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix #10576. Add alias for jQuery.event.handle so voyeur code still works. - Dave Methvin
[13:08:34] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #139: STILL FAILING in 3 min 28 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/139/
[13:08:35] <jq-jenkins> dave.methvin: Fix #10576. Add alias for jQuery.event.handle so voyeur code still works.
[13:09:19] <gnarf> hrm
[13:09:44] * gnarf wonders
[13:10:01] <gnarf> maybe we should make that jQuery.debug plugin
[13:10:17] <gnarf> and add a deprecation warning
[13:10:25] <gnarf> to stuff like that
[13:12:26] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: definitely a topic for post-1.7 meetings ... i'd like to figure out how we can do what UI is doing in migrating apis
[13:13:15] <gnarf> will be harder for us, cause UI relys on setting a prop on jQuery
[13:13:19] <gnarf> before loading
[13:13:30] <DaveMethvin> it would be great to get aggressive about cleaning out the old stuff and providing backcompat for some time via a plugin that had the ability to tell you what you were doin rong via console messages
[13:13:42] <gnarf> right
[13:14:28] <DaveMethvin> it kind of scares me that ppl are using jQuery.event.handle b/c i changed it quite a bit, i have no idea whether outside callers are gonna get what they think they want
[13:14:46] <gnarf> did you talk with mobile about it yet?
[13:15:15] <DaveMethvin> well now their stuff should work too with that patch but yeah i can see what they are doing
[13:15:29] <DaveMethvin> there is a new jQuery.event.simulate that does basically what they are doing
[13:15:42] * gnarf nods
[13:15:48] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez made me expose it
[13:15:50] <DaveMethvin> :P
[13:15:54] <gnarf> i remember
[13:16:15] <gnarf> actually i made scott review that code with me
[13:16:24] <gnarf> which made him make you expose it
[13:16:28] <DaveMethvin> the way mobile is using it looks fine, they are just changing the event type
[13:16:42] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:16:50] <DaveMethvin> that took a few seconds to read
[13:16:59] <gnarf> yes
[13:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: yeah, I think I might've written the code in jQuery Mobile
[13:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> I blame Brandon Aaron
[13:17:51] <DaveMethvin> oh so THAT'S why you wanted simulate
[13:18:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah it seems to be a common pattern for a lot of special events
[13:18:18] <DaveMethvin> which is why i added the special.handle hook
[13:18:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://brandonaaron.net/blog/2009/06/4/jquery-edge-new-special-event-hooks
[13:19:04] <scott_gonzalez> search for "event.handle" on that page
[13:19:15] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, and that code has a bug
[13:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> he even presented it on it at one of our conferneces
[13:19:27] <DaveMethvin> he's changing the event type without resetting it
[13:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> also, it's how every special event was implemented in core
[13:19:34] <DaveMethvin> the mobile code does the right thing
[13:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, I just copied whatever was in core when I wrote the mobile events
[13:20:00] <scott_gonzalez> I even had John sitting right next to me
[13:20:01] <DaveMethvin> by that time i had fixed the bugs reported against that pattern
[13:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> so I blame JohnResig too :-P
[13:20:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm 99% sure I asked him to review it before I committed
[13:20:56] <scott_gonzalez> but most of all I blame you for trying to break it :-)
[13:21:01] <DaveMethvin> well the main thing is that it just became "public" without it ever being documented
[13:21:35] <scott_gonzalez> because it was the only way to do event stuff
[13:22:29] <DaveMethvin> oh well, i think we're in pretty good shape now as long as the existing hookers seem to work
[13:23:18] <DaveMethvin> when brandon did his mousewheel plugin i think he copied two or three properties into the event object that don't need to be there otherwise so I have to send him a pr for that
[13:44:43] <gnarf> lolz @ docs#10588
[13:44:45] <bot-t> [#10588] TODO for 1.6 in source code (closed bug: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/10588
[13:46:05] <gnarf> did we already make a ticket for that btw?
[13:46:41] <gnarf> i know at one point DaveMethvin we were talking about adding something for getting at the events other than .data("events") in a debugging plugin and deprecating .data("events")
[13:47:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think it's another "documented in a blog post" thing, not quite sure where or how it is used in the wild
[13:47:52] <gnarf> should we make a ticket to describe that behavior and put it on the 1.8 feature roll?
[13:47:58] <DaveMethvin> it would definitely be a candidate, yeah
[13:48:04] <ajpiano> wait so what is the deal with that ticket
[13:48:08] <gnarf> although we could probably make the debugging plugin first
[13:48:15] <ajpiano> we never did the thing in the TODO right?
[13:48:27] <gnarf> ajpiano: doing the thing in the TODO was voted down
[13:48:33] <gnarf> i tried to kill it
[13:48:38] <gnarf> but people use it
[13:48:43] <ajpiano> so then the ticket isn't invalid....
[13:48:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah the resolution is to delete the comment :P
[13:49:02] <ajpiano> yeah was halfway through typing that
[13:49:03] <gnarf> exactly
[13:49:06] <DaveMethvin> i think it's safe to fix in rc2! :D
[13:49:14] <ajpiano> but was struggling mightly with the capslock key
[13:49:36] <gnarf> someone asked me to remove the comment, but i left it there
[13:49:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah i have a problem with mine, cat toenail clippings got under a few keys
[13:49:44] <DaveMethvin> it's a long story
[13:49:58] <ajpiano> well at the very least the comment needs to be modified
[13:50:05] <ajpiano> so that it isn't a glaring anachronism
[13:50:17] <gnarf> but DaveMethvin - go ahead and remove the comment?
[13:50:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah fine with me and we can have another ticket to track the work
[13:54:00] <gnarf> docs#10589
[13:54:01] <bot-t> [#10589]  (open enhancement) - http://jqbug.com/10589
[13:55:01] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if you wanna remove that comment, please do - it would take about 1/10th the effort for you to do it than for me to make a pull for you to do it ;)
[13:55:13] <ajpiano> gnarf: i reopened the ticket and assigned it to dave :x
[13:55:15] <DaveMethvin> sure
[13:55:42] <gnarf> ajpiano: removing the comment is gonna happen! but we should discuss actually removing it in the 1.8 cycle
[13:57:35] <timmywil> 0 Yes 0 No 0 Abstain?
[13:57:56] <timmywil> what does it MEAN
[13:58:01] <ajpiano> gnarf: yeah
[13:58:22] <ajpiano> seems like it might be a hard sell
[13:59:26] <gnarf> nice "Although the part about users inspecting event data is still true. Event-data-spying lurkers beware, you are still on death row, but the governor called and said you can have another day. "
[13:59:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ++
[14:01:08] <timmywil> nice
[14:05:11] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i don't know the meaning of the word abstain

[14:06:57] <DaveMethvin> mainly you'd abstain if you don't have a strong opinion about what should be done, or you don't know what the heck the ticket is talking about

[14:18:52] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by dmethvin (14m, 37s ago): Fix #10588. For now, event voyeurism only merits the look of disapproval.If you are using `.data("events")` we would like to know how we can provide a documented interface that satisfies the need.
[14:32:43] <danzik17> DaveMethvin: just for the lol - http://ejohn.org/apps/workshop/adv-talk/#9
[14:34:14] <DaveMethvin> sure danzik17 but that's not saying "hey use this in your apps" ... at least i  hope ppl didn't take it that way
[14:34:38] <DaveMethvin> it is definitely useful for debugging i agree
[14:35:46] <DaveMethvin> i was trying to figure out what apps might do with it, the most common thing I've seen is "are there any events bound [for this event type]?"
[14:39:21] <ajpiano> danzik17: and we're not gonna get rid of it, i think the idea is to actually give an interface
[14:39:27] <ajpiano> instead of plucking it out of the guts
[14:40:29] <danzik17> ajpiano: sure, fine with me (especially since i'm guilty of mucking with it) - just found it funny that it was on johns blog but supposed to be a hush hush dont use this thing
[14:40:57] <ajpiano> i've told people about it here and there too
[14:41:07] <ajpiano> sometimes like, you just want to give people the answer if it's possibly
[14:41:08] <ajpiano> but it's gnarly
[14:45:33] <gnarf> like i said, debugging makes sense
[14:45:47] <gnarf> firequery is a pretty legit user too im sure
[14:45:59] <ajpiano> it's interesting that this guy is pushing the order around
[14:46:13] <gnarf> there has been some request for "bindFirst"
[14:46:16] <gnarf> but like
[14:46:18] <ajpiano> i once thought that would be a nifty plugin
[14:46:35] <gnarf> anytime you are depending on the order of event handlers its probably better solved with a custom event
[14:46:47] <ajpiano> gnarf: but what if i bindFirst and you bindFirst and pretty soon it's like feudal china
[15:02:02] <gnarf> lol

[15:03:11] <scott_gonzalez> well, there's no denying it
[15:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> .data( "events" ) is awesome when you need it
[15:04:45] <DaveMethvin> ok scott_gonzalez you're gonna have to explain that :)
[15:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> every once in a while I find myself confused by what's happening on a page
[15:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> not knowing where some behavior is coming from
[15:05:51] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, debugging totes
[15:06:05] <scott_gonzalez> umm....yeah, not so much in production code
[15:06:25] <DaveMethvin> just not like, "screw with this internal data structure to make it call things"
[15:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> I only used it once in actual code and didn't actually use it because of how horrible it felt :-P
[15:06:40] <scott_gonzalez> I used it to implement .bindFirst()
[15:06:40] <DaveMethvin> guilt is a powerful development tool
[15:06:48] <scott_gonzalez> for modal dialogs
[15:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> I was so afraid that people would view the source and start using it that I never committed it
[15:07:13] <DaveMethvin> lol
[15:07:40] <DaveMethvin> how did it make sure it was firster-first in case someone came in and tried to out-first you?
[15:07:59] <DaveMethvin> setTimeout(makeMeFirst, 1)
[15:08:02] <gnarf> bindBefore
[15:08:20] <gnarf> only states if it should go on the front of the stack or the back of the stack?
[15:08:39] <gnarf> like is that useful?
[15:08:46] <gnarf> or was there a way around it?
[15:09:28] <DaveMethvin> in 1.7 the delegated events are at the front of the list so they can run first, that way .stopPropagation actually works to some extent
[15:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> it assumed nobody else was trying to be an asshole :-P
[15:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> there can be only one
[15:09:58] <DaveMethvin> BAD assumption
[15:11:03] <gnarf> maybe instead of "first" we should use "before" :)
[15:11:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: how did you get around it, or did you just leave it?
[15:11:36] <scott_gonzalez> I left it out
[15:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> you can't actually implement modal behavior properly anyway
[15:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm probably gonna rip out all of the event logic for modals in 1.9
[15:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> go with the simpler, if focus lands outside the dialog, stick it back in
[15:12:46] <DaveMethvin> i like that ... "stay focused"
[15:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> speaking of focus, I still want to write that blog post
[15:14:16] <DaveMethvin> i have one i'm drafting about the "hover" event, basically just a rant i guess
[15:14:27] <scott_gonzalez> gotta go, frozen yogurt time :-)
[15:14:36] <DaveMethvin> did you bring enough for everyone??

[17:31:49] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by dmethvin (3h, 27m ago): Fix #10588. For now, event voyeurism only merits the look of disapproval.If you are using `.data("events")` we would like to know how we can provide a documented interface that satisfies the need.
[17:32:23] <DaveMethvin> well it's good news really, most of it is debugging. Then there are the guys using it for sleazy event juggling
[17:32:32] <gnarf> right
[17:32:44] <gnarf> so like - we should evaluate these cases one at a time
[17:33:03] <DaveMethvin> if they want to do that I have a solution i think, i'll post a fiddle there in a sec
[17:33:16] <gnarf> nice, looking forward to it
[17:39:49] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/dmethvin/rxHjd/
[17:40:39] <gnarf> hrm
[17:40:43] <gnarf> interesting
[17:40:58] <gnarf> dirty
[17:41:05] <gnarf> and can't fire before other delegated ones
[17:41:09] <gnarf> but interesting nonetheless
[17:42:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah it only works if the element has no other delegated events
[17:42:38] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea what they are doing, but it seems to me that they need another layer of abstraction and are too lazy to make it
[17:52:20] <gnarf> yeah
[17:52:21] <gnarf> like
[17:52:33] <gnarf> if you made one handler that conditionally triggered some other event
[17:58:08] <danzik17> well for FWIW, my use of the event juggling isn't all that important (debugging is probably 99% of usage)
[17:58:32] <danzik17> it's only even in there because a nameless co-worker was being a smartass and reordered some events like 10min before a production push and i didn't have time to debug at that point :(
[17:58:52] <DaveMethvin> lol
[17:59:39] <DaveMethvin> well danzik17 if it's a question of  you being lazy or me being lazy i'm gonna pick me every time :D
[18:00:13] <danzik17> pfft
[18:00:41] <danzik17> i'm more interested in just seeing the handlers in order for debugging like everyone else.  re-ordering events is just candy.
[18:02:21] <DaveMethvin> for debugging i totally get
[18:06:05] <gnarf> i think we all completely agree that we need a little transparency / easy access for debugging
[18:06:40] <gnarf> an interesting thing that we might be able to do in a "debugging" plugin would be to look for parent delegated events that match the element as well
[18:06:52] <gnarf> then you could get all event handlers at once, included parent chains :)
[18:21:57] <danzik17> fyi - .data('events') doesn't seem to be working in edge atm anyway
[19:20:40] <gnarf> danzik17: really?
[19:21:20] <gnarf> nice
[19:22:27] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you see that ^^^
[19:22:43] <DaveMethvin> wat
[19:22:50] <gnarf> i broke it :/
[19:23:09] <DaveMethvin> WAT! :)
[19:23:19] <gnarf> .data( "events" )
[19:23:24] <gnarf> it doesn't work in edge
[19:23:26] <DaveMethvin> hey it's only a release candidate
[19:23:34] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:23:50] <DaveMethvin> maybe it was the comment i edited
[19:24:30] <gnarf> nah
[19:24:34] <gnarf> i never updated that line of code
[19:24:38] <gnarf> cuz i thought i was gonna kill it
[19:24:46] <gnarf> then after i lost the argument about killing it
[19:24:52] <gnarf> i forgot about needing to update it
[19:25:06] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah SURE gnarf
[19:27:19] <DaveMethvin> ok so what needs to be changed gnarf? I can just do it here
[19:28:22] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/de4a5dd6cd9b4d27ec9a
[19:28:30] <gnarf> thats probably a tiny enough approach
[19:29:16] <gnarf> testing it now
[19:29:32] <gnarf> its actually -4 bytes gzipped too
[19:30:05] <gnarf> nah, prolly not
[19:30:06] <gnarf> nvm
[19:30:53] <DaveMethvin> i guess we'll pass on a unit test for this ... :)
[19:31:00] <gnarf> +2 --- damnit
[19:33:50] <gnarf> wait a bit on that
[19:33:53] <gnarf> not sure if it fixes it
[19:33:53] <DaveMethvin> kk
[19:35:51] <gnarf> ummm
[19:35:52] <gnarf> yeah
[19:35:56] <gnarf> this is pretty complicated
[19:35:58] <gnarf> actually
[19:36:36] <DaveMethvin> hey no hurry gnarf, if you want to sleep on it we can do it tomorrow morning
[19:37:22] <gnarf> yeah
[19:37:23] <gnarf> like
[19:37:34] <gnarf> this sucks actually
[19:37:39] <gnarf> because its falling out way up above
[19:37:44] <gnarf> on the "element doesn't have any data"
[19:38:03] <DaveMethvin> ya know, from the feedback we've gotten already i am not sure we NEED this to work
[19:38:35] <DaveMethvin> i mean, if someone wants to see the data they just say jQuery._data(elem, "events") and they have it
[19:38:41] <danzik17> tbh as long as people know that you can just use _data for debugging, then whatever
[19:39:03] <DaveMethvin> and since i already broke the format of the data inside it, they will have to touch that code anyway.
[19:39:15] <DaveMethvin> so if that's the case maybe we take it out
[19:39:44] <DaveMethvin> danzik17: exactly
[19:39:58] <danzik17> just remembering previous conversations tho - wasn't jqueryui or mobile using .data('events') for something
[19:40:01] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: https://gist.github.com/de4a5dd6cd9b4d27ec9a
[19:40:06] <gnarf> fml
[19:40:24] <DaveMethvin> lol it's getting bigger
[19:40:27] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ^^^ that fixes it
[19:40:48] <DaveMethvin> for some values of "fixes"
[19:40:50] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:41:29] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/de4a5dd6cd9b4d27ec9a for the full diff not just what i had to change on top
[19:42:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's prolly too late to change it in 1.7 so we'll need to hack in something
[19:43:09] <DaveMethvin> i just wish it wasn't so much code
[19:43:35] <DaveMethvin> but .data() is a mess, maybe i should try to untangle that for 1.8
[19:44:28] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: agreed, but we should probably put that code in so that people don't bitch about its quick disappearance :)
[19:45:13] <DaveMethvin> yep
[19:45:57] <gnarf> i hate that i had to break that distinction even earlier
[19:46:08] <gnarf> if you get rid of that events hack, that particular function isn't so bad
[19:53:13] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: btw, $._data( elem[0], "events" )
[19:54:34] <DaveMethvin> ok, patch seems good and i ran a few cursory tests so, here goes
[19:54:47] <DaveMethvin> unless you want to create a unit test for this monster ... :P
[19:55:18] <DaveMethvin> did anyone file a bug?
[19:55:32] <gnarf> no
[19:56:45] <DaveMethvin> ok pushed
