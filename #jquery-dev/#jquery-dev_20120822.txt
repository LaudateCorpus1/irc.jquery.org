[05:45:28] <ajpiano> uch DaveMethvin
[05:45:40] <DaveMethvin> wat
[05:45:41] <b-ot> The new icon changes your desktop look really professional!
[05:45:47] <ajpiano> overnight a mouse sullied most of the chocolates i acquired in san francisco
[05:45:55] <DaveMethvin> OH NO
[05:45:58] <ajpiano> :((
[05:46:12] <DaveMethvin> man that sucks
[05:46:22] <DaveMethvin> how does chocolate last that long around your place?
[05:47:12] <ajpiano> lol, good point
[05:47:33] <ajpiano> guess i should have encouraged her to take more of it to work
[05:47:36] <ajpiano> instead of... throwing it out :(
[05:47:52] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: also docs#12365 really ground my gears
[05:47:54] <bot-t> DaveMethvin, [#12365] Change all obj++ to ++obj where applicable (closed enhancement: invalid) - http://jqbug.com/12365
[05:48:25] <DaveMethvin> WON'T ANYONE THINK OF THE CLIENTS???1
[05:48:51] <ajpiano> you know when you're like, workin for a client and you have a deliverable
[05:49:06] <ajpiano> and then they go off and read the code of all your 3rd party low level libraries, just to learn javascript?
[05:49:16] <ajpiano> that surely happens to me all the time!
[05:49:27] <DaveMethvin> i think you just have to push those crazy requests back onto them, if they want to prove they are right they are welcome to show us the error of their ways
[05:49:40] <DaveMethvin> there's no way that arguing with them will make them change their mind
[05:50:02] <DaveMethvin> i still can't figure out what's wrong with x++
[05:50:08] <ajpiano> yea
[05:50:11] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure js doesn't care
[05:50:19] <ajpiano> that's what i asked
[05:50:26] <DaveMethvin> even C compilers don't care if it's not in an expression where  you need the value
[05:50:36] <ajpiano> where does "good programming practice" dictate that ++foo is ALWAYS better than foo++
[05:51:12] <DaveMethvin> and if you do, a[x++] maps into a single assembly code instruction in many cases ..  a[++x] does not
[05:51:15] <DaveMethvin> SO THERE
[05:51:25] <ajpiano> BAM
[05:51:34] <DaveMethvin> that's why the operator was created in C in the first place
[05:51:42] <DaveMethvin> so there would be a syntax to capture that
[05:52:10] <ajpiano> you sure it wasn't just to confuse the clients
[05:52:27] <DaveMethvin> soo, ajpiano, topic change ... we need to talk about the whateverfest agenda
[05:52:43] <ajpiano> ah yes, we most certainly do
[05:53:00] <ajpiano> i can do that at like 9:#0 ?
[05:53:02] <ajpiano> 9:30
[05:53:12] <DaveMethvin> check out my email from last night, and  yeah just ping me at 9:30 on skype
[05:53:38] <ajpiano> okey doke, ttyiab
[06:06:02] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, "good programming practice" would say not to use ++ at all :-P
[06:06:34] <scott_gonzalez> Then there's never confusion. At least if you following the Crockford-style of programming to reduce errors.
[06:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, DaveMethvin if $.browser is going to be in 1.9-compat, can we drop the jquery-browser repo?
[06:07:06] <DaveMethvin> yes we will
[06:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:07:26] <scott_gonzalez> I've got a big list of repos for us to go over today :-)
[06:07:32] <DaveMethvin> there will be a grunt task so you can build custom versions there
[06:07:51] <DaveMethvin> i suspect if they cdns take anything it will be the whole lump only
[06:07:57] <DaveMethvin> the*
[06:08:18] <scott_gonzalez> Little known fact: once you get your library on the CDN, you can pretty much put whatever you want up there.
[06:08:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's like a free pass!
[06:08:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, check it out: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.23/ui/jquery.ui.core.js
[06:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> We have all the source files up there :-P
[06:09:25] <DaveMethvin> damn i'll start using them to back up my hard drive
[07:22:59] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: 14:15 in to this, I talk about your favorite part of jQuery :-) http://events.jquery.org/2010/boston/video/video.php?talk=scott-gonzalez
[07:25:02] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, I even said "html doesn't exist in attrFn, oh maybe it might" OF COURSE IT DOES!
[07:25:27] <chaitu> Hi all, I am writing a listener for capturing the name of the tests that are run by qunit and i am getting an error , need help
[07:25:27] <scott_gonzalez> Hah, 15:30 I talk about $.fx.speeds.
[07:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> Man, I need to stop talking about undocumented APIs in my talks.
[07:26:56] <chaitu> anyone ready to help?
[12:23:35] <Eviltwin> I used to have the patience for the horribly broken English in some of the questions in #jquery
[12:23:39] <Eviltwin> I lost that somewhere along the way
[12:26:57] <dialman> LOL, definitely.
[12:27:12] <dialman> I still like to help out though, it makes me feel all warm and fuzzy.
[12:27:54] <dialman> The fact that 1/2 of the questions can be answered by using google for about 30 seconds can be kind of annoying.
[12:33:49] <Eviltwin> Yeah, this was lovely the other day: "<Geffer> .siblings()  Three in the demo because the color black?"
[12:34:07] <Eviltwin> "<Geffer> see site jquery siblings () <li class="hilite"> Three </ li> because this black?"
[12:34:51] <dialman> WTF does that even mean?
[12:35:09] <dialman> Good for laughs I suppose :)
[12:46:52] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: hmmm https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/data/event/partialLoadReady.php#L3
[12:47:21] <DaveMethvin> i think the problem is that these are apache-related and swarm is ngnix
[13:50:09] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: could be. Can you ping gnarf / Corey about that?
[14:26:47] <DaveMethvin> hey gnarf ... how can we ngnix-ize this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/data/event/partialLoadReady.php#L3
[14:27:20] <DaveMethvin> i found this: http://www.justincarmony.com/blog/2011/01/24/php-nginx-and-output-flushing/

[14:40:40] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Correct documentation of custom grunt task. Closes gh-904 - Mike Pennisi
[14:58:46] <DeathRayDragonLu> I didn't know where to log issues, but ril kwik: $(whatever).on('hover', '.whatever', function() { ... }, function() { ... }); registers TWO MOUSELEAVE events in 1.8 for whatever reason.
[14:59:05] <DeathRayDragonLu> I had to separate into mouseleave and mouseenter to get it to work.
[15:01:11] <ajpiano> DeathRayDragonLu: 1) bugs can be reported at http://bugs.jquery.com
[15:01:23] <ajpiano> DeathRayDragonLu: 2) .on("hover", ".foo", fn, fn) isn't supported
[15:01:44] <ajpiano> hover isn't an event, it's just an alias to a direct bind of mouseenter and mouseleave
[15:03:52] <DeathRayDragonLu> i c
[15:04:33] <ajpiano> ok!

[15:17:00] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: hrm
[15:17:32] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: not sure we can get it to behave like apache would
[15:18:14] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: be dumber? :D
[15:18:26] <DaveMethvin> I'll talk with mikesherov aboutit
[15:18:39] <DaveMethvin> i think this unit test may not be needed anyway
[15:18:50] <dialman> DaveMethvin, Did you ever get a fresh install of everything on Windows to work the other night?
[15:18:59] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/197216
[15:19:04] <DaveMethvin> dialman: sorry,no
[15:19:21] <DaveMethvin> i still want to do it but i am hoping to get 1.8.1 out in the next couple of days
[15:19:24] <dialman> I figured since I didn't see you in here :)
[15:19:27] <DaveMethvin> so that's higher on the pile
[15:19:30] <dialman> NP, I understand
[15:20:25] <dialman> Pushing out a new release instead of helping some random guy you barely know get setup, seems pretty reasonable.

[18:00:43] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I'm nervous about that Android 2.1 bug
[18:00:58] <DaveMethvin> oh mikesherov ... just looking for you
[18:01:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah i dunno what is going on there
[18:01:13] <DaveMethvin> but maybe we should just back off the ready stuff
[18:01:41] <DaveMethvin> also, the partialLoadReady test file itself needs work
[18:01:48] <DaveMethvin> it's got Apache-isms in it
[18:02:01] <DaveMethvin> and the ngnix swarm doesn't like it
[18:02:07] <mikesherov> I'm unable to reproduce on browserstack
[18:02:18] <DaveMethvin> are you using ngnix
[18:02:42] <DaveMethvin> @ini_set("output_buffering", 0);
[18:02:42] <DaveMethvin> @apache_setenv("no-gzip", 1);

[18:08:36] <mikesherov> ajpiano: can we please change the channel topic please! It's so old.
[18:15:18] <mikesherov> b-ot: tell DaveMethvin that I'm waiting for an update re: the android .ready bug and looking into output buffering on the nginx issue, but that test needs to stay as it's the only unit that fails on readyState interactive
[18:15:19] <b-ot> mikesherov, I’ll tell DaveMethvin about that.
[18:16:02] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: i'm inclined to disable it for now since it totally breaks the event module tests
[18:16:02] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[18:16:10] <DaveMethvin> b-ot: read for god's sake
[18:16:17] <mikesherov> LOL
[18:16:26] <mikesherov> probably needs to be just "read"
[18:16:32] <DaveMethvin> b-ot: read
[18:16:32] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, from mikesherov, 1m 13s ago: that I'm waiting for an update re: the android .ready bug and looking into output buffering on the nginx issue, but that test needs to stay as it's the only unit that fails on readyState interactive
[18:16:51] <DaveMethvin> wat
[18:16:51] <b-ot> grr i just want that number that shows in the alert to be where the i is below it in the has
[18:16:53] <mikesherov> oh, does it fail?

[19:32:40] <snover> DaveMethvin: i have a great mobile safari bug to share with you
[19:32:45] <snover> since i know you like these sorts of things
[19:34:01] <snover> input field inside any element with a touch event handler inside an iframe = no cut, no copy, no paste, and if you try, the keyboard stops working
[19:35:01] <DaveMethvin> haha, sounds like an ie7 bug someone recently reported snover
[19:35:20] <DaveMethvin> safari is the new ie
[19:35:21] <snover> yeah except people actually use mobile safari :'(
[19:35:24] <snover> i knowwwww
[19:35:30] <snover> it’s awful.
[19:36:24] <DaveMethvin> if they would just update it and force ppl to update everything would be fine
[19:36:49] <snover> well at least it’s not android
[19:37:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's an ugly baby
[19:37:16] <DaveMethvin> of course by the end of the year we'll be supporting ie6,7,8,9,10 ... kinda scary
[19:37:29] <snover> that is why you drop the first three, right :)
[19:37:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah, but only for 2.0
[19:37:52] <DaveMethvin> it's gonna be so fun to cut that code tho
[19:38:04] <snover> that’s like 80% of jquery right there man
[19:38:07] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:38:18] <DaveMethvin> well not that much but still
[19:38:40] <snover> no sizzle, no $.data, single event path…
[19:39:03] <DaveMethvin> try/finally will be nice for us
[19:39:15] <DaveMethvin> no ie7 attroperties!
[20:00:14] <mikesherov_> DaveMethvin: So, what'll it take for gnarf to make nginx capable of output buffering?
[20:00:26] <DaveMethvin> i dunno, i looked around in google
[20:00:31] <DaveMethvin> seems like it's hard
[20:00:53] <DaveMethvin>  http://www.justincarmony.com/blog/2011/01/24/php-nginx-and-output-flushing/
[20:01:19] <mikesherov> Yeah, saw that. Do I just poke him with a stick?
[20:01:48] <DaveMethvin> there will be no abusing of the gnarf while anyone is looking!
[20:02:15] <DaveMethvin> that's a bit old, maybe they added some more knobs
[20:03:02] <DaveMethvin> so, since android 2.1 is kind of old i could live with leaving it broken for 1.8.1
[20:03:18] <DaveMethvin> but it's worrisome
[20:03:31] <DaveMethvin> i'd prefer that if something was broken it wouldn't be document.ready
[20:03:33] <DaveMethvin> :D
[20:04:08] <DaveMethvin> in core we tend to talk in black and white support terms, we either SUPPORT or !SUPPORT
[20:04:16] <DaveMethvin> but mobile has shades of gray
[20:04:44] <DaveMethvin> so i wouldn't mind if some obscure stuff didn't work on some of these older browsers, but ready seems kind of essential
[20:04:53] <DaveMethvin> oh and  hi rwaldron
[20:05:16] <DaveMethvin> how's the big apple treating you?
