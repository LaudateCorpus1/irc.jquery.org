[05:30:42] <DaveMethvin> .
[05:30:43] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, you have one new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[05:30:54] <DaveMethvin> b-ot: read it already
[05:31:09] <DaveMethvin> b-ot: ReAd
[05:31:22] <DaveMethvin> b-ot: read
[05:31:40] <DaveMethvin> b-ot: you are not a very good bot
[05:31:59] <DaveMethvin> b-ot: were you going to tell me about that build problem jaubourg found?
[05:32:00] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, cannot predict now.
[05:32:14] <DaveMethvin> what is it boy?
[05:32:22] <DaveMethvin> did timmy fall down the well?
[05:32:55] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: that was an elegant pun
[05:33:20] <DaveMethvin> bots these days
[05:33:30] <DaveMethvin> they understand NOTHING
[05:34:08] <DaveMethvin> ?tell jaubourg looks like a versioning problem with grunt, so darn we can't blame you
[05:34:09] <b-ot> DaveMethvin, Iâ€™ll tell jaubourg about that.
[05:34:30] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah b-ot that's what you told jaubourg and you haven't given me HIS message
[05:35:46] <danheberden> i think b-ot has a french filter
[05:36:43] <DaveMethvin> don't we all?
[05:37:06] <danheberden> good point
[05:37:34] <danheberden> except i could listen to jaubourg talk for HOURS
[05:37:53] <danheberden> like even if he's talking about how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
[05:38:01] <danheberden> it sounds like he's deconstructing the complexities of the universe
[07:30:59] <arschmitz> DaveMethivin: are you around?
[09:01:12] <DaveMethvin> timmywil rwaldron jaubourg gibson042 orkel mikesherov #jquery-meeting time!
[10:22:50] <timmywil> I hope we didn't decide to remove type-ahead find on our docs site
[10:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: It's gone, but the full listing on the index page is going away too.
[10:24:06] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: why?
[10:24:14] <scott_gonzalez> Why to which one?
[10:24:30] <scott_gonzalez> The full listing is not a great index page.
[10:24:36] <timmywil> yes it is
[10:24:59] <timmywil> type-ahead find + full listing was what made our docs great
[10:25:09] <scott_gonzalez> So you probably want http://api.jquery.com/category/all/
[10:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> But the filtering isn't implemented on the new site. Feel free to re-implement it.
[10:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> But, do you want that or do you want autocomplete in the search field?
[10:29:04] <timmywil> good question. autocomplete would be helpful for getting to category indexes, but filtering the methods visible on the page provides reassurance that the right method is being used.
[10:31:18] <timmywil> I'm not that concerned. Type-ahead was my favorite feature tho.
[10:32:23] <timmywil> however, I still think a full listing index page is ideal for docs
[10:33:45] <timmywil> there's no introductory content that could be more important than the docs themselves
[10:36:50] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: There's going to be introductory content.
[10:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> See http://api.jqueryui.com/ for an example.
[10:37:56] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: that content could be put elsewhere
[10:38:06] <timmywil> and probably should be
[10:40:36] <timmywil> The docs are a constant reference. Once that is read once, nobody wants to see it again.
[10:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> I refer to docs all the time, I never ever use the full listing.
[10:43:33] <timmywil> you might if the full listing was small enough as is the case for jQuery core
[10:44:38] <scott_gonzalez> Umm...what?
[10:44:51] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery core's listing is at least an order of magnitude larger than UI's.
[10:45:59] <timmywil> Does UI only least component names?
[10:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jqueryui.com/category/all/
[10:46:37] <timmywil> ah, then all the more reason why it could be the index
[10:48:07] <timmywil> see backbonejs.org or expressjs.com/api.html or http://lodash.com/docs
[10:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> You're going to point to single page docs as a reference?
[10:50:35] <scott_gonzalez> Our docs site is pretty different from all of those.
[10:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> Those are all just massive API dumps.
[10:51:54] <timmywil> UI needs mutliple pages. I fail to see why core needs an introductory page.
[10:59:57] <timmywil> In other words, with UI, I understand why it wouldn't be that useful to show all categories as you only use one widget at a time (and maybe that's only widget you're using). An api reference is all I need for core. Each method having its own page for more info is great (which, btw, is the only thing that makes core docs different from an API dump).
[11:06:31] <timmywil> also, the point about UI's list being smaller isn't really related as it's not the same kind of listing
[13:21:00] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: do you also have 31 fails in Chrome on 1.9-stable?
[13:22:50] <timmywil> ugh, grunt watch failure, nvm

[14:15:13] <timmywil> doesallmagic: but you didn't run any tests!
[14:15:13] <doesallmagic> timmywil did you mean me? Unknown command 'but'
[14:15:13] <doesallmagic> Use '!jenkins help' to get help!
[14:15:41] <timmywil> :P
[14:31:54] <DaveMethvin> hey timmywil
[14:32:01] <DaveMethvin> just coming out of all day training 
[14:32:07] <DaveMethvin> so how bad is it?
[14:32:14] <timmywil> I bet you're tired
[14:32:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[14:32:36] <timmywil> false alarm, this grunt watch not working thing is messing with my system
[14:32:51] <DaveMethvin> looks like the 1.9 build is failing now on grunt too
[14:33:06] <timmywil> the build is failing?
[14:33:09] <DaveMethvin> i think that's the sign of it being version mismatched
[14:33:14] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%201.x%20Core/36/console
[14:33:25] <timmywil> oh the tests
[14:33:34] <DaveMethvin> well the build before the tests
[14:33:44] <DaveMethvin> the tests are not failing, they're not being run :D
[14:34:46] <timmywil> i see
[14:35:19] <DaveMethvin> i might be able to fix this but not until later tonight
[14:35:30] <DaveMethvin> i think we need to move up to the latest grunt and plugins
[14:35:32] <timmywil> well, it seems I missed a few tests when trying out this :visible thing
[14:35:45] <timmywil> but that's probably not related to build problems
[14:36:04] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: yea, upgrading grunt might help
[14:36:28] <DaveMethvin> makes me scared to blow off node_modules and re-init :P
[14:36:57] <DaveMethvin> alright, i gotta move, they're gonna throw me out of here soon 
[14:37:07] <timmywil> oh, we specifically test for elements having a width of 1 and a height of 0 to be visible?
[14:37:37] <timmywil> that kinda kills my solution
[14:37:40] <timmywil> :/
[14:40:26] <timmywil> well, maybe we shouldn't be doing that
