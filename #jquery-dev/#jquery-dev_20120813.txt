[00:13:18] <SlexAxton> I noticed today that since some of the cssHooks are not written until domReady, that if you add your own cssHooks before domReady, then jQuery blows them away. I've added this information to the api.jquery.com docs - but perhaps it should try and see if there's something there already, and mix, or something.
[02:00:43] <agcolom> Hi! I was just checking things in the jquery types for the mobile docs, and found this page: http://docs.jquery.com/Types Is this not used anymore or it it just that the copyright needs to be updated? (all the pages under http://docs.jquery.com/ seem to have a copyright of 2010).
[02:02:33] <agcolom> DaveMethvin, jzaefferer, scott_gonzalez ^
[02:03:36] <agcolom> The release notes for 1.8 are here, so I guess these are not old but need a new copyright note...
[02:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: http://api.jquery.com/Types
[02:18:35] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: All of docs.jquery.com is going away very soon.
[02:24:23] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell DaveMethvin We're approaching double digits on duplicates for the dialog buttons issue :-P
[02:24:24] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[02:34:00] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok thanks :-)
[02:37:34] <agcolom> i got there because all links in the top banner on http://api.jquery.com/Types go to docs.jquery.com :)
[02:38:26] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: where are you?? (Isn't this crazy early for you?)
[02:39:13] <scott_gonzalez> NY right now. It's 5:30a here :-/
[02:39:49] <agcolom> OMG!!!! yes, it is crazy early!!! Well, have a great morning ;-)
[03:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> Why do I have to deal with stuff like this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/710#issuecomment-7687842
[05:07:09] <mikesherov> .
[05:32:04] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: you can close this ticket as well, which is the jqueryui ticket tracking it: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6969#comment:8
[05:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: Thanks. I'll close that ticket when 2.0.0 is released and I pull it into UI.
[05:33:08] <mikesherov> ok, cool. Thanks
[05:33:21] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for getting that fixed.
[05:33:29] <mikesherov> np
[05:33:32] <mikesherov> sorry it took so long
[05:33:40] <mikesherov> I was slammed at work this past week.
[05:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> No problem, there are plenty of other things holding up 1.9 :-/
[05:34:40] <mikesherov> heh
[05:35:01] <mikesherov> Lots of tickets coming in about the dialog buttons issue on core 1.8 too
[05:35:17] <mikesherov> And I sense a coming tide of complaints about the slowness of .width() I introduced
[05:35:31] <mikesherov> I have a feeling 1.8.1 will be released quickly
[05:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, core got 3 tickets about dialog, right?
[05:35:57] <scott_gonzalez> We've gotten like 5 in UI.
[05:36:04] <mikesherov> yeah
[05:36:30] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know what's going on with 0 duration animations?
[05:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> Was that change intentional?
[05:36:54] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Color build #65: SUCCESS in 8 min 7 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/65/
[05:36:55] <doesallmagic> mike.sherov: fixes #13, auto expand borderColor for browsers that don't support the shorthand
[05:37:03] <mikesherov> I'm not sure if it was intentional
[05:37:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to do the 1.8.23 release with the dialog fix and the 0 duration animation fix tomorrow.
[05:37:21] <scott_gonzalez> Just need to get back home to my old laptop.
[05:37:32] <mikesherov> I remember gnarf saying something about the 0 duration case, but I don't know what it was
[05:38:14] <mikesherov> my problem is now .width() and .height() respect box-sizing and are slower as setters than .css('width') because they need to query for box-sizing
[05:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> What are people doing that the slow down is noticable?
[05:39:13] <mikesherov> setting .width() on 1000 elements
[05:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, right, but what are they actually trying to accomplish? Do we know if this is affecting anyone with sane use cases?
[05:39:48] <mikesherov> it doesn't effect animations
[05:40:00] <mikesherov> because anims use .css('width') and I made sure that case was fast
[05:40:27] <mikesherov> I'm thinking just change the expected behavior of .width() and .height() to not respect box-sizing, and if you need to be sure it's content width regardless of box-sizing, I can introduce .contentWidth() and .contentHeight()
[05:40:33] <mikesherov> we'll see what they say at the meeting
[05:40:47] <mikesherov> I don't know what they're trying to accomplish
[05:40:54] <mikesherov> They presented a pathlogical case
[05:41:05] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12269#comment:3
[05:41:30] <mikesherov> at first I was reading the results wrong :-\
[05:42:28] <mikesherov> it's not just webkit, but it's more noticeable in webkit, presumably because getComputedStyle is way slower there
[06:14:14] <vrodic> hi, anybody interested in taking a look at a 1.8.0 IE9/10 regression?
[06:20:41] <scott_gonzalez> vrodic: The team will look at it.
[06:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know why rwaldron asked for a reduced test case. What you provided is pretty small.
[06:22:08] <vrodic> scott_gonzalez, yeah, i'm not sure how to respond to that
[06:40:40] <vrodic> scott_gonzalez, and the problem is that i can't reproduce it with jsfiddle probably because it introduces more side-effects
[06:41:14] <scott_gonzalez> vrodic: You can always reproduce in jsFiddle if it's legit.
[06:41:35] <scott_gonzalez> You can add "/show" to the URL if the iframe is causing issues.
[06:42:26] <vrodic> scott_gonzalez, ok, i've found a way that involves clicking "run" after the page has been loaded once. however, you can't be serious that jsfiddle is neutral :)
[06:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> Why can't I be serious?
[06:45:45] <vrodic> scott_gonzalez, that we can always reproduce bugs in jsfiddle. jsfiddle adds a lot of state and possible heisenbugs can occur
[06:46:53] <vrodic> browsers are complex pieces of code, and adding more code can unnecessarily enlarge the minimal test case
[06:47:36] <scott_gonzalez> This is pretty minimal, it could be smaller, but there are going to be very few cases where this will affect anything: view-source:http://jsfiddle.net/wq7gq/show/
[06:47:48] <vrodic> scott_gonzalez, yeah i agree
[06:48:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why they link to a blank script and stylesheet for the minimal case though.
[06:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> Seems silly.
[06:51:16] <vrodic>  what matters is that i can make rwaldron happy by making a test case in jsfiddle
[06:51:20] <vrodic> :)
[06:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[06:55:42] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: you around?
[07:02:38] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Color build #66: SUCCESS in 9 min 28 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/66/
[07:02:38] <doesallmagic> * Scott González: Update authors.
[07:02:38] <doesallmagic> * Scott González: Simplify licensing.
[07:25:43] <jaubourg> plop
[07:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell gnarf I updated the licensing for Color. We should be ready for release. I think version.txt can be deleted.
[07:28:29] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[09:02:22] <mikesherov> to meeting?
[09:05:18] <DaveMethvin> meeting!
[09:49:20] <mikesherov> so
[09:50:20] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: did I just break the internet?
[09:50:45] <DaveMethvin> whyzat mikesherov, oh you mean .width() ?
[09:50:52] <mikesherov> .ready
[09:51:34] <mikesherov> I'm not cut out for such large repercussions
[09:53:08] <mikesherov> good news it seems to only be limited to IE9/IE10, and even then, transient
[09:53:23] <mikesherov> and we'll probably fix it in about a week
[09:56:19] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: let's face it, jquery can't do anything at this point without breaking the internets
[10:02:59] <gnarf> jaubourg: you planning on fixing that promise bug, or i can attack it after this meeting
[10:04:01] <jaubourg> I'll look into it
[10:04:12] <jaubourg> apparently, it's older than 1.8 so
[10:04:14] <jaubourg> ;)
[10:05:38] <gnarf> jaubourg: heh - alright - cc me on the pull?
[10:06:57] <jaubourg> hmmm
[10:07:02] <jaubourg> I don't know the code anymore :P
[10:07:08] <jaubourg> queueHooks
[10:07:18] <jaubourg> maybe I'd better let you have a look
[10:08:13] <jaubourg> you don't support unqueued anims anymore?
[10:11:40] <jaubourg> gnarf: ^^
[10:12:07] <gnarf> jaubourg: it is supported - its unit tested even
[10:12:13] <gnarf> jaubourg: :)
[10:23:23] <jaubourg> now that shows how little I know about the code now ;)
[10:28:36] <gnarf> jaubourg: hey just so you know
[10:29:03] <gnarf> jaubourg: all the uses of .promise( "queue" ) in the unit tests assume that it is called when the last function is dequeued
[10:29:17] <gnarf> not when there is a dequeue on no function
[10:31:37] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/unit/queue.js#L3-48
[10:43:31] <danheberden> DaveMethvin paul_irish is there a way to get this updated? https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide
[10:45:02] <gnarf> jaubourg: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/893
[10:52:12] <danheberden> gnarf will this auto pull if i merge? https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/pull/4
[10:52:24] <gnarf> danheberden: no
[10:52:56] <gnarf> danheberden: I can make it go live though
[10:53:09] <gnarf> danheberden: gotta cherry-pick it onto "legacy"
[10:53:23] <gnarf> and then grunt deploy it
[10:53:36] <gnarf> or it is merged to legacy - nvm
[10:53:50] <gnarf> if you merge it , i can push it
[10:54:07] <danheberden> gnarf merged
[10:54:35] <gnarf> danheberden: pushed
[10:54:38] <danheberden> and thank you
[10:54:39] <danheberden> :)
[11:01:47] <gnarf> jaubourg: do those altered units still make sense to you?

[12:42:25] <danzik171> out of curiosity, is there a 1.9/2.0 branch started out there somewhere or are people basking in the afterglow of 1.8 for the moment?
[12:44:31] <scott_gonzalez> danzik171: We're basking in the afterglow of 1.8, AKA working on 1.8.1 to fix regressions.

[14:09:48] <paul_irish> ya
[14:11:40] <snover> i might miss the free visitor geolocation though~
[14:11:57] <paul_irish> well. it still exists.
[14:12:01] <paul_irish> it's just not maintained.
[14:12:07] <paul_irish> and the geolocation is kinda flaky.
[14:12:23] <paul_irish> but the URL for jsapi wont 404 anytime soon

[16:15:48] <Codex> Hello
[17:10:36] <tbranyen> jaubourg: you around by any chance?
[17:33:17] <mikesherov> .
[17:34:11] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: just the guy I wanted to see
[17:34:23] <DaveMethvin> oh you have the money?
[17:34:28] <DaveMethvin> :D
[17:35:15] <mikesherov> LOL
[17:35:22] <mikesherov> http://jsperf.com/getcomputedstyle-perf
[17:36:18] <mikesherov> punchline: gCS is slow as shit no matter how you slice it
[17:36:34] <DaveMethvin> aw you coulda given a spoiler alert dammit
[17:36:39] <DaveMethvin> :)
[17:36:54] <DaveMethvin> sooo
[17:37:05] <DaveMethvin> what's a mother to do?
[17:37:28] <mikesherov> yeah
[17:37:34] <mikesherov> that's the question
[17:37:49] <mikesherov> I've provided the options, I need your experience on this call
[17:38:01] <DaveMethvin> well it seems we're doing the Right Thing now
[17:38:06] <DaveMethvin> but not the Fast Thing
[17:38:31] <DaveMethvin> so do we compromise our rightness for fastness/
[17:38:32] <mikesherov> well, again, it's only "right" according to our docs
[17:38:49] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, change the docs escape hatch :P
[17:38:53] <mikesherov> we could be just as "right" if we change the docs to say that .width() and .height() are just sugar
[17:39:08] <mikesherov> and introduce .contentWidth() and .contentHeight()
[17:39:33] <mikesherov> yeah, I'm not advocating for either direction, I'm just trying to be as forth coming with the options as possible
[17:39:46] <kswedberg> mikesherov: when you tested .width() vs .css('width'), did you run parseInt() on the .css('width') call?
[17:40:08] <kswedberg> or parseFloat()
[17:40:16] <mikesherov> Um
[17:40:22] <mikesherov> I'm not sure
[17:40:41] <kswedberg> cuz you'd need to do that for the test to be fair, right?
[17:40:49] <mikesherov> the jsperf I just linked clearly says to me it's the gCS call where all the perf goes
[17:40:58] <kswedberg> ok
[17:41:01] <mikesherov> http://jsperf.com/getcomputedstyle-perf
[17:41:22] <DaveMethvin> i think you're technically right kswedberg (the best kind of right) but gCS definitely seems like the killer
[17:41:31] <mikesherov> I mean, the parseFloat certainly can help, but I'm fairly confident at this point that 99% of it is just getComputedStyle which makes sense
[17:41:37] <kswedberg> ok, I believe you both. :)
[17:41:43] <mikesherov> THE BEST KIND OF CORRECT
[17:41:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah at first i was thinking gCS should not be slow
[17:41:58] <tbranyen> this isn't a business plan its an escape plan
[17:42:14] <DaveMethvin> but then i realized
[17:42:15] <mikesherov> I am bender, please insert girder
[17:42:15] <tbranyen> DaveMethvin: so sad wrt to sync deferrends
[17:42:18] <DaveMethvin> it has to run up the cascade
[17:42:22] <tbranyen> i had to switch to async
[17:42:27] <tbranyen> walls were torn down
[17:42:39] <kswedberg> mikesherov: one other question… does .css('width') always return a number + 'px' ?
[17:42:49] <mikesherov> kswdberg, yes
[17:43:09] <kswedberg> good to know.
[17:43:15] <mikesherov> .width() and .height() were sugar to .css('width') with some parsefloat action
[17:43:43] <kswedberg> until you started meddling? ;-)
[17:43:51] <kswedberg> just kidding!
[17:43:51] <mikesherov> right
[17:43:55] <DaveMethvin> and we woulda gotten away with it too
[17:43:58] <mikesherov> no, quite literally
[17:44:10] <DaveMethvin> it it wasn't for gCS
[17:44:13] <mikesherov> I made it be truthful to the docs even when box-sizing is border-box
[17:44:30] <DaveMethvin> that's why i'm hesitant to move away from it
[17:44:41] <DaveMethvin> but
[17:44:50] <mikesherov> so now the setter queries for boxSizing to see if it needs to subtract some stuff
[17:44:51] <kswedberg> mikesherov: I'd be interested in seeing the perf difference between .width() in 1.7.2 and .width() in 1.8.0
[17:45:20] <kswedberg> would it be similar to current diff between .width() and .css('width')?
[17:45:23] <mikesherov> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12269
[17:45:54] <mikesherov> 1.7.2: .width() setter is sugar to .css('width') setter
[17:46:05] <DaveMethvin> here's what's bothersome about consistent powerful apis ... two things can look equally simple but be incredibly different in performance
[17:46:07] <mikesherov> 1.8.0: .width() setter accounts for box-sizing
[17:46:18] <mikesherov> the setter is way slower in 1.8.0 because of this
[17:46:30] <mikesherov> on the order of 100X slower O_o
[17:47:32] <DaveMethvin> i'm sad if we can't make .width() match the css notion of width
[17:47:48] <mikesherov> the irony is that when you use box-sizing:border-box, the .css('width') and .width() getters are super fast
[17:47:48] <DaveMethvin> even when that notion changes based on the css
[17:48:13] <mikesherov> but DaveMethvin, we can! With a new API
[17:48:23] <DaveMethvin> cheater!
[17:48:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah if we leave .width() broken
[17:48:33] <mikesherov> and css notion of width changes when box-sizing does
[17:48:40] <DaveMethvin> "broken"*
[17:48:55] <mikesherov> the problem is that we didn't anticipate box-sizing when .width() was created, or we would've never claimed it's always content width
[17:49:02] <DaveMethvin> right
[17:49:08] <DaveMethvin> keeping those damn promises is a pita
[17:49:14] <mikesherov> sure
[17:49:24] <mikesherov> but then again, most people don't want "always content width"
[17:49:30] <DaveMethvin> okay
[17:49:34] <mikesherov> they want "width", whatever that means
[17:49:51] <DaveMethvin> well before the interrogation we should get our stories straight
[17:49:55] <kswedberg> if we changed it,  in some cases width() would be the same as outerWidth(), right?
[17:50:02] <mikesherov> which is why I think the best path forward is doc change, and one new function :-\
[17:50:24] <mikesherov> width() would always return the box-sizing css notion of width
[17:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> paul_irish: Can we get the URL to actually point to jqueryui.com instead of jquery.com?
[17:50:40] <mikesherov> which is content-width when content-box, and content+padding+border in border-box
[17:51:06] <mikesherov> and contentWidth() would always account for box-sizing, like the other "new" dimension setters
[17:51:24] <mikesherov> and always just return content-width, which is a made up thing
[17:51:39] <mikesherov> or what "width" means in the content-box scenario
[17:51:51] <DaveMethvin> but a very nicely made up thing, which prevents us from being 100x slower
[17:51:56] <mikesherov> yes
[17:52:25] <DaveMethvin> hmmmm
[17:52:40] <DaveMethvin> contentWidth is sounding better and better
[17:53:15] <mikesherov> right, especially because it clarifies the difference that isn't apparent between .css('width') and .width()
[17:53:25] <mikesherov> and that most people aren't box-sizing yet
[17:53:34] <DaveMethvin> let's deprecate .width() :P:P
[17:53:59] <mikesherov> and that most people don't even care .width() returns something different because they won't encounter it
[17:54:08] <DaveMethvin> right it's the legacy code we have to think about as far as perf is concerned
[17:54:14] <mikesherov> those who do and need that func should use .contentWidth()
[17:54:24] <DaveMethvin> for new box-sizing we can make them do it diferently, right
[17:54:31] <DaveMethvin> there isn't that much code using it
[17:54:41] <mikesherov> right, and legacy isn't using border-box anyway
[17:54:43] <mikesherov> right
[17:54:58] <mikesherov> and as long as animations can account for box-sizing, then we're good
[17:55:30] <mikesherov> the good thing is that I set up the adjuster to only ever have to do tweaks on the getter in the basic .css('width') case
[17:55:36] <mikesherov> so animations are still nice and fast
[17:55:49] <DaveMethvin> well as much as i'd like width() to stay as-is, I don't think we can deal with a 100x slowdown so that sounds good
[17:55:51] <mikesherov> and I can make .width() and .height() simple passthroughs to that
[17:55:59] <mikesherov> and adding the new API is super duper easy
[17:56:05] <DaveMethvin> supa dupa
[17:56:11] <mikesherov> SUPA FLY
[17:56:28] <DaveMethvin> you want to run that proposal by jquery-devs-team?
[17:56:34] <mikesherov> sure
[17:56:41] <DaveMethvin> sounds good to me
[17:56:47] <mikesherov> OK, I'll email out.
[17:56:51] <DaveMethvin> i think it breaks the least stuff
[17:57:00] <mikesherov> well, hopefully it breaks nothing
[17:57:14] <mikesherov> I mean, just the people who have upgraded to 1.8 and expect the new functionality
[17:57:46] <DaveMethvin> nobody has upgraded to 1.8 ... too many bugs and it's too damn slow :P
