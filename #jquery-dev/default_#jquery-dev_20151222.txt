[11:10:49] <markelog> timmywil: you there?
[11:38:53] <markelog> timmywil:m_gol: is anybody there?
[11:39:06] <timmywil> oi
[11:40:17] <markelog> i kinda finished with 1.12-stable
[11:40:24] <markelog> but there is one tough commit
[11:40:48] <markelog> the one that removes support for oldIE
[11:41:04] <markelog> i don't have fast access to oldie
[11:41:18] <markelog> i'm wondering if anyone could help me out with it 
[11:41:29] <markelog> also, we need to run swarm on 1.12 
[11:41:34] <markelog> which seems to be disabled
[11:46:33] <markelog> timmywil:.
[11:47:37] <timmywil> well, I'm not sure I can help with swarm, but you need someone to run tests on oldie?
[11:48:25] <timmywil> I can use sauce.
[11:49:04] <markelog> i think it would be tedious
[11:49:17] <markelog> i would be asking for it every second
[11:49:39] <markelog> maybe you could try your strengths on it?
[11:49:44] <markelog> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/90d7cc1d8b2ea7ac75f0eacb42439349c9c73278
[11:49:55] <markelog> other changes already in 1.12-stable
[11:50:03] <timmywil> what are we trying to do? revert it?
[11:50:05] <markelog> right now i'm checking if i didn't miss anything
[11:50:09] <gibson042> timmywil markelog: I ran into some substantial chaos yesterday and today (not having to do with jQuery).... here's hoping for a Sizzle release today, but it's looking less and less likely. On the plus side, though, no biggie to release without it
[11:50:09] <markelog> yeah
[11:50:13] <gibson042> see you on the other side
[11:50:34] <markelog> gibson042: yeah, i guess it is not a blocker for minor release
[11:50:36] <timmywil> gibson042: ok thanks
[11:51:15] <timmywil> markelog: ok, I'll give it a shot
[11:51:21] <markelog> thank you!
[11:53:01] <markelog> try to not hate this world while you will be doing that :-), it is very tedious :/
[11:53:54] <markelog> with my connection to the browserstack is pretty much hopeless 
[11:54:14] <markelog> Krinkle:gnarf: anybody here?
[11:54:30] <markelog> gnarf_:
[11:58:35] <markelog> timmywil: after the revert, there will be bugs (at least with tests) with those browsers
[11:58:45] <markelog> even if you would do everything correctly
[11:59:03] <markelog> since we dropped support more then a year ago
[11:59:09] <markelog> for those browsers
[11:59:23] <markelog> so every commit after that, didn't account for those envs

[13:39:08] <markelog> timmywil: did you had the chance of reverting that commit?
[13:39:30] <timmywil> I've got the start of something, but will test it later
[13:40:16] <timmywil> need to get all the support values right in the support tests. I know they're off right now.
[13:40:56] <timmywil> are we continuing old opera support?
