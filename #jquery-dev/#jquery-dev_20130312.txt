[05:12:32] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: What's up?
[05:12:36] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin|away: 
[05:12:50] * Krinkle is reading up
[05:16:26] <Krinkle> TRIGGER WEIRD BOT
[05:16:33] <Krinkle> TRIGGER WEIRD BOT?
[05:16:44] <Krinkle> TRIGGER WEIRD BOT LET ME IN?
[05:16:48] <Krinkle> Hm.. not doing it
[05:16:52] <Krinkle> lol
[05:17:01] <Krinkle> Y U NO LET ME IN?
[05:17:01] <b-ot> Krinkle: (å±®'Ð”')å±®
[05:17:05] <Krinkle> aha
[05:17:31] <Krinkle> I'm usually quite good at deciphering these <s>ancient symbols</s> icons, but I don't get this one.
[05:17:50] <Krinkle> I also can't log into trac btw, haven't been able for weeks
[05:18:15] <Krinkle> and even when I can it is so slow and unusable, I better spent my time doing something else or poking someone directly to get it fixed.
[05:18:42] <Krinkle> I would file a bug to say that we have 2 unreliable unit tests that someone with experience in those modules needs to fix, but I can't.
[05:19:58] <Krinkle> the "attributes" test is consistently failing in safari 5.1
[05:20:17] <Krinkle> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/38 http://swarm.jquery.org/result/27718 
[05:21:08] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, stupid Trac
[05:21:40] <JamesMGreene> DaveMethvin|away did a manual password reset for me (since I also never received the password reset email) but all of my preferences were gone too
[05:21:58] <Krinkle> including e-mailaddress?
[05:22:01] <JamesMGreene> yup
[05:22:02] <Krinkle> so you still don't have it
[05:22:13] <JamesMGreene> Have what?
[05:22:20] <Krinkle> access to trac / your password reset.
[05:22:30] <JamesMGreene> Well I have access to Trac now
[05:22:33] <Krinkle> o
[05:22:35] <Krinkle> ok
[05:22:38] <JamesMGreene> but I had to fill in all my prefs again
[05:22:59] <JamesMGreene> Which perhaps is why the password reset email never got sent (i.e. it lost my email address)...?
[05:26:50] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: What was your workflow to separate QUnit addons?
[05:27:12] <Krinkle> Do you mean the plan for others, or how I've done it with others?
[05:27:13] <JamesMGreene> Duplicate (not fork) repo, cleanup, commit, push?
[05:27:28] <Krinkle> Yep
[05:27:28] <JamesMGreene> Just technical git commands, basically
[05:27:31] <Krinkle> create empty repo
[05:27:37] <Krinkle> create directory structure like this: https://github.com/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit
[05:27:59] <Krinkle> Move in the files as-is, no changes to the actual files (or only where absolutely neccecary to make it work)
[05:28:09] <Krinkle> and then file issues / pull requests for any changes.
[05:28:28] <Krinkle> then commit to qunit repo removing the addon leaving a link to the first tag in the new repo
[05:28:28] <JamesMGreene> OK, so you didn't even duplicate the repo, you just copied them in manually (which achieves the same result)
[05:28:42] <Krinkle> there is no concept of "duplicating" a repo that I know of.
[05:29:03] <Krinkle> That is, if you don't fork it
[05:29:10] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit/commit/e1101b62ad55ecd3f81c3c20a73390c965e1c7bf
[05:29:10] <b-ot> Krinkle: Timo Tijhof (2w 6d ago): Initial import from 'jquery/qunit.git:addons/junitlogger'.  Tree: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/tree/43f4c94497/addons/junitlogger
[05:29:27] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/67585c7d98761e835d5361631b327016d0db6517
[05:29:27] <b-ot> Krinkle: Timo Tijhof (2w 6d ago): Moved 'addons/junitlogger' to 'jquery/qunit-reporter-junit.git'.  Tree: https://github.com/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit/tree/v1.0.0
[05:29:33] <Krinkle> Those two commits pretty much show the workflow
[05:29:55] <JamesMGreene> https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository
[05:30:22] <Krinkle> okay, I obviously know what the word means and how one could duplicate a repository
[05:30:25] <Krinkle> but that's not relevant here
[05:30:31] <Krinkle> we're not duplicating qunit
[05:30:45] <JamesMGreene> Right
[05:30:48] <JamesMGreene> Well
[05:30:54] <Krinkle> but separating out a specific part of the repository, not in any way part of qunit (the application) itself.
[05:31:11] <JamesMGreene> When I've split things in the past sometimes I essentially did that and then rm/mv'd the rest into configuration
[05:31:30] <Krinkle> it's a possibility
[05:31:34] <JamesMGreene> I'm not sure if that technique brings the history along though, which would be undesirable
[05:31:42] <JamesMGreene> I'm good with your technique
[05:31:46] <Krinkle> It doesn't, it can't.
[05:32:08] <Krinkle> not unless you fork (or "duplicate" with is exactly the same, except you do it locally instead of clicking buttons on github)
[05:32:14] <Krinkle> and then do it in a separate commit
[05:32:29] <Krinkle> github "fork" is doing this: https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository
[05:32:40] <Krinkle> + making a link in their database marking it as a fork.
[05:32:49] <Krinkle> that's all.
[05:32:59] <JamesMGreene> yup yup
[05:33:12] <JamesMGreene> So question
[05:33:31] <JamesMGreene> As far as the unit tests for QUnit Composite go, I can go 1 of 2 ways when moving this
[05:33:33] <Krinkle> don't forget AUTHORS, grunt, package.json, jshint and test.
[05:36:04] <JamesMGreene> I can (1) drop it, which jzaefferer OKed, or (2) point to the core and other addons' tests via the qunitjs node_module's subdir
[05:36:22] <Krinkle> define "drop it"
[05:36:35] <Krinkle> how about just creating a few small sample test suites and composing those?
[05:36:45] <jqcommit> 01[13qunit-reporter-junit01] 15Krinkle pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/b8kZDw
[05:36:45] <jqcommit> 13qunit-reporter-junit/06master 14eda3861 15Timo Tijhof: README: Update old grunt link....
[05:39:30] <JamesMGreene> Well right
[05:39:37] <JamesMGreene> We need separate tests altogether
[05:39:53] <JamesMGreene> My point was more for the first commit, since the goal was to change as little as possible while moving it
[05:40:21] <JamesMGreene> drop it = no unit tests for the first commit
[05:41:15] <Krinkle> ok
[05:43:17] <JamesMGreene> So for composing the AUTHORS, I assume you just look at the git history for that particular addon directory?
[05:47:12] <JamesMGreene> (i.e. a pretty `git log` for that folder)
[05:47:59] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: use grunt-git-authors 
[05:51:37] <JamesMGreene> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-git-authors/issues/5
[05:51:37] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: Issue #5 by JamesMGreene (21s ago): Add an option (or `files`) to target a particular directory/file
[05:51:56] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: Yes, I copied it and reduced it to contributors to files in that directory only
[05:51:58] <JamesMGreene> Or does grunt-git-authors respect the cwd
[05:52:03] <JamesMGreene> ?
[05:52:23] <Krinkle> You didn't even try before filing a bug?
[05:52:43] <JamesMGreene> Well, for a grunt task, I think it's appropriate to add that w/o having to manually path around
[05:53:13] <JamesMGreene> grunt tasks are typically relative to the root (well, deepest folder with a Gruntfile)
[05:53:20] <JamesMGreene> So it's a valid issue either way, IMHO
[05:54:28] <JamesMGreene> If I want my Gruntfile to generate an AUTHORS.txt for each subdir or something, I don't want to have to add `cd` tasks into my Grunt workflow to achieve that
[05:57:07] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Do you knoww offhand if grunt-git-authors respects `cwd` or was that just a speculation?
[05:57:53] <jzaefferer> I have no idea, and I didn't speculate. Ask scott_gonzalez?
[05:58:25] <JamesMGreene> eh, I'll jus try it
[05:58:28] <JamesMGreene> just*
[05:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't.
[06:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> And so far I'm not sure it should.
[06:00:21] <scott_gonzalez> The use case you've presented is: I want to run this once and never commit it.
[06:00:56] <JamesMGreene> It is relative to the nearest Gruntfile, like all grunt tasks
[06:01:30] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: Not exactly, I want to commit it to a different repo :-P
[06:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> You don't want to commit the TASK to a different repo.
[06:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> Please confirm that you would not have a commit in which you use the option you're requesting.
[06:02:18] <JamesMGreene> ah, I see your point there
[06:02:25] <JamesMGreene> Probably not in my use case
[06:02:31] <JamesMGreene> Doesn't mean others wouldn't
[06:02:43] <JamesMGreene> depends on their idea of how to use an AUTHORS file
[06:03:01] <JamesMGreene> anyway, baby just woke up, gotta run

[06:34:35] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Do you have admin rights on github? I created https://github.com/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit but I can't change the settings.
[06:34:47] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I do, what do you need?
[06:34:48] <Krinkle> I'd like to enable travis
[06:35:02] <Krinkle> I just added a basic test suite for linting and testing.
[06:35:32] <jzaefferer> How does Travis deal with organizations?
[06:35:33] <Krinkle> npm install && npm test does it all, so no travis.yml file needed, plug and play.
[06:35:52] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Go to travis, profile, all repos are listed there
[06:36:02] <Krinkle> both personal and from organisations
[06:36:35] <jzaefferer> I see
[06:37:02] <jzaefferer> how does travis know to run npm commands without the travis.yml file?
[06:37:16] <Krinkle> Thats the default for js projects, determined by package.json presence
[06:37:40] <Krinkle> You'll never see a travis.yml file containing "npm install" or "npm test"
[06:38:05] <jzaefferer> okay, hook is in place, using my username and token
[06:38:14] <Krinkle> it always does that, you can only add custom commands. there may be a way to override it, but afiak it'll always do npm install/test. 
[06:38:57] <jzaefferer> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit
[06:39:34] <jzaefferer> I guess it needs another commit first before it'll output anything useful
[06:40:09] <jzaefferer> btw. Krinkle maybe you have an idea for this? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/162 I also want to ask James, but I don't he's got access to that repo yet

[06:47:53] <Krinkle> I don't have that installed
[06:47:56] <Krinkle> Only one way to findn out
[06:48:50] <Krinkle> Not sure what's going on at travis, the builds aren't doing anything
[06:48:56] <Krinkle> not even basic vm boot
[06:54:45] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: browserstack is getting suckier again..
[06:55:00] <Krinkle> firefox vms have had their windows not focussed for almost 3 weeks now
[06:55:08] <Krinkle> reported it twice
[06:55:34] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: looks like jquery-mobile is being built on Travis, using credentials from gseguin. So that approach should be fine
[06:55:44] <Krinkle> saucelabs?
[06:56:29] <jzaefferer> I still haven't tried saucelabs for my validation plugin
[06:56:40] <jzaefferer> been meaning to do that to get some experience with it
[06:56:47] <jzaefferer> its already on Travis though
[06:56:59] <Krinkle> I'm working on using grunt-saucelabs at Wikimedia, seems nice so far, but it is in very early stages
[06:57:06] <Krinkle> the output is absolutely horrible
[06:57:24] <Krinkle> no way to know what browser had failures and no access to the test results.
[06:57:39] <Krinkle> that's poor implementation however, not something due to saucelabs
[06:58:06] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: another drawback, though our instability is to blame, is that when using travis/grunt/saucelabs you can't easily re-run a test
[06:58:13] <Krinkle> or render the qunit html dom
[06:58:28] <Krinkle> that last part can be mitigated by working on a prettier cli reporter.
[06:58:53] <Krinkle> the former however isn't fixible and right now our tests are too instable or saucelabs/browserstacks vms are to just have it run once and have that be enough
[06:59:18] <Krinkle> plus there is the obvious issue with using saucelabs: it's selenium, which means the browsers are driven by web driver which limits the browser landscape available.
[06:59:34] <Krinkle> though that is steadily increasing.
[07:41:17] <JamesMGreene> Is there a milestone set for removing the `success`/`error`/`complete` callbacks for `$.ajax`?
[07:45:07] <JamesMGreene> (Similarly: where can I go to find out such info? Trac? Some Google Doc? etc.)
[07:45:23] <JamesMGreene> (Roadmap?)
[07:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=%21closed&status=%21pending&group=milestone&report=3&order=priority
[07:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> It's really annoying that Trac expands URLs for query reports.
[07:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> That's just http://bugs.jquery.com/report/3
[07:47:48] <scott_gonzalez> You'll notice that there is no ticket for removing those callbacks.
[07:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> It would break a LOT of code.
[07:50:28] <JamesMGreene> Yeah, see, that's what I was afraid of (not the code breakage but the whole never-going-away thing): http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4825#comment:12
[07:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> Why do you care if it doesn't go away?
[07:51:25] <scott_gonzalez> Just don't use it.
[07:51:56] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: any thoughts on the Jenkins/PhantomJS issue?
[07:52:29] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: No, I need to get at the box to troubleshoot w/ the dump file
[07:52:46] <JamesMGreene> Still don't have access
[07:53:04] <JamesMGreene> gnarf was trying to get me setup with it but we were never online at quite the same time
[07:53:12] <jzaefferer> ugh, okay
[07:53:44] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: Couldn't we at least move it to the migrate plugin or something?
[07:54:03] <jzaefferer> let me look for that
[07:54:07] <scott_gonzalez> JamesMGreene: There is no difference between moving to the migrate plugin and removing.
[07:54:11] <scott_gonzalez> They are literally the same thing.
[07:54:12] <JamesMGreene> I guess I'm not familiar with what jQuery core's policy is on API stuff but it just feels weird keeping around a deprecated API without API parity
[07:54:32] <JamesMGreene> scott_gonzalez: exactly :-P
[07:54:58] <scott_gonzalez> We're like Atlassian, "Don't fuck the customer" is a core value.
[07:55:36] <JamesMGreene> Not to go to wild here but I feel like jQuery 2.0 has such an opportunity to cleanup the API as well as the guts but is missing up due to the whole [brilliant] API parity with 1.9
[07:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery 2.0 cannot clean up the API.
[07:55:55] <JamesMGreene> Waiting for 3.0 could be a while, though :)
[07:56:31] <scott_gonzalez> Step down from your ivory tower, join the masses ;-)
[07:57:11] <JamesMGreene> Sadness
[07:57:16] <JamesMGreene> but understandable
[08:01:18] <JamesMGreene> It's a tough position for jQuery being the world leader and whatnot :-o
[08:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need to be as popular as jQuery to care about making breaking changes like this with very little benefit.
[08:06:03] <JamesMGreene> Sure but that is what major version revving is made for
[08:06:28] <JamesMGreene> Like I said, jQuery 3.0 I guess =)
[08:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> Revving major versions quickly with breaking changes doesn't make it any better.
[08:08:32] <JamesMGreene> I guess as a developer who cares about the code I write (a comment on the consumers, not jQuery authors), I am more than happy to pay the price of updating some API references if I want to upgrade my jQuery version. If I'm not, then I just shouldn't upgrade unless it fixes some bug, improves a perf issue, etc.
[08:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> Upgrading will almost always fix bugs and improve perf.
[08:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> That's why we want users to upgrade.
[08:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> Removing commonly used features makes that harder.
[08:18:42] <JamesMGreene> Again, understood, and why I [personally] wait for major version revs to break stuff
[08:19:06] <JamesMGreene> but my libraries aren't on 70+% of the world's websites or anything ;)

[10:55:38] <Krinkle> that build was created 20 minutes ago
[10:55:42] <Krinkle> still not a single line of outpout
[10:55:55] <JamesMGreene> Has it started?
[10:56:01] <JamesMGreene> Or is it just queued?
[10:56:18] <JamesMGreene> Looks like they're just queued
[10:56:30] <Krinkle> Well, in a way
[10:56:34] <Krinkle> if you click the build
[10:56:38] <Krinkle> it'll say Status: Created
[10:56:46] <Krinkle> which means it has been popped off the queue and into the pipeline
[10:56:46] <JamesMGreene> Yeah
[10:56:58] <Krinkle> which is usually a state that is invisible, it just flies straight to "Running"
[10:57:07] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: btw, see also https://twitter.com/travisci/status/311515746519896065 conversation
[10:57:07] <b-ot> Krinkle: @travisci: @defunctzombie @3rdEden technically, itâ€™s correct to parse 0.10 as 0.1, as both are the same as a number :)
[10:57:24] <JamesMGreene> No, it should say "Started"
[10:58:29] <Krinkle> Yeah
[10:58:55] <Krinkle> well, wahtever the cause. I shouldn't take 30 minutes to get a simple build done.
[10:59:05] <Krinkle> they're probably under a lot of load
[11:17:26] <JamesMGreene> It's like this during the [US] daytime a lot, it seems
[11:18:18] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle: Don't you just hate when free things are disappointing? :)
[11:19:04] <Krinkle> Nothing is for free, besides I'd consider Travis a community service.
[11:19:47] <Krinkle> I donated, too. That doesn't give me any right of course. But it's not geocities serving ads and crappy pages having an outage, it's Travis being slow!
[11:21:59] <JamesMGreene> lol
[11:22:02] <JamesMGreene> true
[11:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> Aw shucks, AMD caused a production outage? What a shame.
[11:28:36] <JamesMGreene> I think we need to donate more to Travis, Krinkle :(
[11:28:50] <Krinkle> haha, we have the same rolling joke in Wikimedia irc channels
[11:29:12] <Krinkle> whenever the page loads slow, people on Twitter are sometimes like: Yeah, you didn't participate in the frundraiser, we're to blame :P
[11:30:26] <JamesMGreene> lol
[11:31:02] <JamesMGreene> I wish they at least had a queue depth counter, i.e. "You are 112345th in line"
[11:31:10] <JamesMGreene> ^ our current position :)
[11:31:53] <JamesMGreene> You can get a general ID by looking the recent builds list
[11:32:25] <JamesMGreene> i.e. https://travis-ci.org/horaceli/bizwebsys/builds/5446586 had been running for ~30 seconds
[11:32:41] <JamesMGreene> Our next queued build is https://travis-ci.org/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit/builds/5446840
[11:33:20] <JamesMGreene> So: 5446840 - 5446586 = Position 254 in the queue
[11:52:43] <JamesMGreene> http://status.travis-ci.com/incidents/x33mzxml1j1g
[11:53:11] <JamesMGreene> Probably as a result of http://status.travis-ci.com/incidents/dc517699nmcm
[11:54:33] <JamesMGreene> There, they finally changed the status to yellow
[11:54:52] <Krinkle> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit/builds
[11:55:00] <Krinkle> https://travis-ci.org/jquery/qunit-reporter-junit/builds/5448107
[11:55:03] <Krinkle> come on
[11:55:06] <Krinkle> it's been over an hour
[11:55:29] <Krinkle> Hm.. Right, they have a status feed now
[11:55:33] <Krinkle> I used to expect those on Twitter
[11:55:40] <Krinkle> now they only do major things on Twitter
[12:02:55] <JamesMGreene> It's approximately position 387 -_-
[12:04:23] <JamesMGreene> Anyone ever compiled something with emscripten or node-gyp?
[12:23:23] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle|detached: Woohoo, build finally ran and passed
[12:49:06] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer: btw, I figured out why I got access to those individual forks repos under the infrastructure team. It's because the infrastructure repo is private... therefore the forks remain private (even if the user doesn't have a plan to include private repos) and also remain a part of the org that they were forked from. Same thing happened when I was helping out with pre-release Yeoman
[15:45:54] <DaveMethvin> .
[16:17:46] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez: Do either of you have ability to reset my password? I filled in my details in Forgot Password on jqbugs, but I'm not getting anything (checked Junk/Spam folders already)
[16:17:58] <Krinkle> it's been over 8 hours.

[19:17:12] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg are you around
[19:17:36] <kswedberg> hey DaveMethvin. yeah, for a little bit. just got back. sup?
[19:18:02] <DaveMethvin> if there's an error building a page I pushed to stage, how would I find out?
[19:18:09] <DaveMethvin> i thought there were emails
[19:18:17] <DaveMethvin> but i don't seem to be getting them
[19:19:23] <kswedberg> huh. what kind of errors?
[19:19:56] <kswedberg> are you running `grunt` or `grunt deploy` to double-check before pushing?
[19:20:00] <DaveMethvin> well the pages i am pushing up don't seem to be updating
[19:20:17] <DaveMethvin> i don't have a full wordpress install locally
[19:20:46] <kswedberg> ah. ok. 
[19:22:09] <kswedberg> I'm gonna run grunt deploy locally to see if things update here.
[19:23:38] <kswedberg> I see. it's failing because of missing categories. I'll take care of it.
[19:23:46] <DaveMethvin> oh
[19:23:56] <DaveMethvin> so  how do i create new categories?
[19:26:40] <DaveMethvin> looks like the process involves editing /categories.xml then? 
[19:26:53] <kswedberg> edit categories.xml
[19:27:00] <kswedberg> yeah. :)
[19:27:29] <DaveMethvin> i just looked around for something appropriate, once I knew the error :D
[19:27:36] <kswedberg> I just took care of it and ran grunt deploy again. all looks good, so I'll push
[19:28:07] <DaveMethvin> okay so it sounds like i really need to get that local setup done 
[19:28:56] <kswedberg> well, for most edits, just running `grunt` as a sanity check is enough. but can't hurt to have a local setup
[19:29:27] <DaveMethvin> i'm getting an error on running the check-modules task
[19:29:36] <DaveMethvin> but i'll have to look into it
[19:29:42] <DaveMethvin> says it can't find something, doesn't tell me what
[19:29:55] <kswedberg> hmm. did you run npm install?
[19:30:00] <kswedberg> oh wait.
[19:30:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:31:39] <DaveMethvin> at least on Windows, it is dying on the `npm ls` part of grunt-check-modules
[19:31:45] <DaveMethvin> so i'll need to look at that
[19:31:51] <DaveMethvin> npm runs fine from the shell
[19:32:32] <kswedberg> you mean running npm ls from the shell is ok? when you're in the api directory?
[19:33:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah i got npm install to work fine
[19:33:38] <DaveMethvin> but grunt dies when grunt-check-modules tries the `npm ls` command
[19:33:42] <kswedberg> right, and `npm ls` works fine, too?
[19:33:43] <DaveMethvin> it can't find npm
[19:33:58] <DaveMethvin> yes
[19:34:27] <DaveMethvin> oh it's giving me an error that pygments isn't installed 
[19:34:46] <DaveMethvin> npm ERR! extraneous: pygments@0.1.3 c:\wamp\www\api.jquery.com\node_modules\pygments
[19:34:57] <DaveMethvin> but it's "extraneous" dontcha know
[19:35:32] <kswedberg> ah. delete it! or, just delete the whole node_modules folder and run npm install again
[19:36:02] <kswedberg> that's yer problem right there, DaveMethvin . 
[19:36:29] <DaveMethvin> nope, at the same place again with check-modules
[19:36:46] <DaveMethvin> but npm ls is happy when i run it manually
[19:37:56] <kswedberg> what if you just go into â€¦ node_modules\grunt-check-modules\tasks\check-modules.js and comment out lines 13-26? :)
[19:40:33] <DaveMethvin> gets to xmllint and once again has probs finding something
[19:40:43] <DaveMethvin> a lot of times
[19:40:48] <DaveMethvin> one for each file i'd guess
[19:46:58] <DaveMethvin> alright, i think that's it for me .. gotta figure out why these paths aren't working
[19:47:18] <DaveMethvin> strange, this is the only repo where i have the prob tho
[20:15:43] <kswedberg> ugh. sorry, DaveMethvin 
[20:15:59] <DaveMethvin> hey i use windows i'm used to it kswedberg
[20:16:54] <kswedberg> hehe. maybe scott_gonzalez can help when he's around. he's usually the one I bug to help me when I get stuck with this sort of thing. :)
[20:17:39] <kswedberg> gotta hit the sack. ttyl, DaveMethvin .
[20:17:51] <DaveMethvin> cya kswedberg
[21:33:04] <JamesMGreene> DaveMethvin|away does that repo have Windows line endings?
[21:33:07] <JamesMGreene> (CRLF)
