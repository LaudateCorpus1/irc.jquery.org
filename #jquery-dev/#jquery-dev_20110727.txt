[05:08:19] <muzone> I'm trying to use http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#radio - but look at all the shitload of CSS I have to include for it to work - http://jsfiddle.net/TKr3k/ - is there a quick way to delete everything I don't need, or do I have to use Firebug to disable one line at a time and see if it affects my radio buttons? Fuck!
[05:09:04] <muzone> And, is there any way to customize the names of my jQuery UI CSS selectors? That would be hot!
[08:30:32] <rwaldron> Hey everyone!
[08:30:36] <rwaldron> wooo!
[08:30:46] <rwaldron> https://mail.mozilla.org/pipermail/test262-discuss/2011-July/thread.html - Single test per file or not?
[09:27:47] <matjas> $('input[required]') doesn’t match `<input required> ` in IE6 and IE7, does anyone know off-hand if that’s a known bug?
[09:35:19] <jdsharp> Obscure trivia question, did jQuery ever support $("document") ?
[09:35:34] <ajpiano> not that i know of
[09:35:44] <irae_> matjas: some html5 elements and attributes as being discussed on the jquery bugtracker. paul_irish opened a related issue, but I don't know if the discussion covers the required attribute specifically
[09:35:44] <ajpiano> it also doesn't support $("this") :p
[09:35:54] <jdsharp> Me neither, but just wanted to be of
[09:36:03] <jdsharp> hehe
[09:36:23] <jdsharp> ajpiano: I'm going to go open a feature request... $("this") would be very useful
[09:36:25] <jdsharp> thanks
[09:36:36] <ajpiano> haha
[09:37:05] <irae_> matjas: I think that if you're using modernizr or html5shiv you will probably be covered.
[09:38:41] <ajpiano> hmm i'm sort of confused though what the canonical ticket for that bug is irae_, matjas
[09:38:57] <ajpiano> timmywil: which ones are you talking about here: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9504#comment:10
[09:39:39] <irae_> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6485
[09:42:31] <DaveMethvin> jdsharp, the reason $("document").ready( ... ) works is because .ready() doesn't care what the selected set is, i suspect that is where you are seeing it "work"
[09:43:11] <ajpiano> hmm didn't realise this covered that
[09:43:21] <irae_> ajpiano: I read a conversation where paul_irish discussed this bug yesterday here or on #html5 - I'm searching for the logs
[09:43:26] <jdsharp> ah ok, received a question about this and didn't think it was possible but didn't want to assume it was completely bunk
[09:43:35] <DaveMethvin> http://www.google.com/codesearch#search/&q=%5C$%5C(%22document%22%5C)
[09:43:46] <DaveMethvin> lol, bad programmers think alike
[09:43:57] <irae_> lol
[09:44:04] <jdsharp> DaveMethvin: wowa....
[09:44:18] <jdsharp> I think I just took the wrong pill
[09:44:33] <ajpiano> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide20
[09:44:40] <ajpiano> not an uncommon mistake obvs :/
[09:44:42] <DaveMethvin> "It can't be wrong ... because it works!"
[09:45:50] <jdsharp> hey, you can't blame people for their creativity
[09:46:18] <DaveMethvin> ...until they start filing bugs against us!
[09:46:40] <jdsharp> agreed
[09:46:52] <irae_> matjas , ajpiano : found the discussion around html5 support in jquery: http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/html5/20110727#l-61
[09:47:58] <ajpiano> ah
[10:57:47] <timmywil> ajpiano: matjas: 5637, 7128, 9261, 6358, and 9795 with other bugs related to has attribute selections where the value is empty
[10:59:12] <timmywil> I'm digging into it for 1.7.  Hopefully hooking in jQuery.attr will help with the problem, but it's difficult because IE doesn't default to null or undefined sometimes for empty values.  Even if the property has never been defined before, you might get back empty string for the attribute value.
[11:00:45] <timmywil> which means it's difficult to differentiate between an attribute that actually has a value of '' (or no value) and an attribute that doesn't exist
[11:06:44] <timmywil> ?tell ajpiano docs#5637 is the most related, but there's also 7128, 9261, 6358, and 9795 related to has-attribute problems.  I'm assigned to most of those for 1.7.

[11:26:15] <rwaldron> aw snap
[11:26:23] <rwaldron> where is dave?
[11:26:33] <rwaldron> he just blitzed me on 9921
[11:26:37] <rwaldron> :\
[11:26:39] <tbranyen> daves not here man
[11:26:39] <rwaldron> Additionally, your selector seems to lack an understanding of how selectors actually work. Selectors are evaluated from Right to Left, so essentially, you're asking for _all_ anchors then filter down to those that are children of the class provided - twice.
[11:26:43] <rwaldron> nice one
[12:41:21] <gnarf> addy around?
[12:49:35] <gnarf> kswedberg maybe?
[12:52:41] <kswedberg> hi gnarf!
[12:52:57] <gnarf> kswedberg: caught addy on the api-team mailing list
[12:53:09] <gnarf> so like read that to know what i was asking about ;)
[12:53:17] <gnarf> and julian isn't here
[12:53:18] <gnarf> boo
[12:54:30] <kswedberg> ah! yeah. that change didn't make sense to me, either.
[12:55:29] <kswedberg> I started to change it until I realized I couldn't make any more sense of it in deferred.promise. so, yeah, looks like it belongs on $.fn.promise
[12:58:41] <gnarf> definately
[12:58:55] <gnarf> and I'm pretty sure there is a better way to word it
[12:59:21] <gnarf> it was just generally confusing, and like i said, I feel I have a pretty good grasp of promises and animations :)
[14:21:16] <kswedberg> gnarf: if you have a sec to look at it again, at http://api.jquery.com/promise/, I'd really appreciate it.
[14:22:44] <gnarf> kswedberg: that sounds reasonable, and seems to make sense
[14:22:52] <kswedberg> phew!
[14:23:04] <kswedberg> thx for looking it over, gnarf. :)
[14:35:50] <tbranyen> scott_gonzalez: you around?
[17:13:12] <Dr4g> night
[18:12:39] <scott_gonzalez> tbranyen: ping me tomorrow (any time during the day)
[18:13:53] <tbranyen> scott_gonzalez: ha okay
