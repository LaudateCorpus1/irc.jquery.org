[03:38:33] <gnarf> omg.. activity in jquery-color git?
[03:38:35] <gnarf> wtf :)
[03:52:08] <muzone_> Why are jQuery / jQuery UI's CSS selectors structured-like-this and not structured_like_this which is normal?
[03:52:13] <muzone_> I was at this jQuery convention the other day and me and the guys joked a lot about it - how painful it is to always go and manually rename all the CSS selectors in jQuery / jQuery UI just to make them fit with our own CSS which use underscores and not dashes
[03:52:38] <muzone_> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/base/jquery-ui.css for instance
[05:49:32] <scott_gonzalez> so does Firefox autoupdate mean that we no longer test again 4.0?
[06:03:43] <jaubourg> that's the plan for 1.7 or 1.8? I don't remember
[06:03:58] <jaubourg> and hi scott :)
[06:14:23] <jaubourg> hey timmy
[06:15:01] <timmywil> hey jaubourg
[06:15:21] <timmywil> ?time Brussels
[06:15:22] <bot-t> timmywil, Brussels, Brussels - Time: 15:15 Friday (CEST), Weather: Rain, 17°C / 63°F
[06:15:32] <timmywil> oh ok ;)
[06:15:33] <jaubourg> ?time timmywil
[06:15:34] <bot-t> jaubourg, No results found for 'timmywil'.
[06:15:38] <jaubourg> hmmm
[06:15:46] <timmywil> 9:15
[06:15:49] <jaubourg> k
[06:15:51] <jaubourg> ;)
[06:16:23] <jaubourg> would like to have your opinion on this exception in ajax callbacks not releasing the active counter
[06:16:35] <jaubourg> I think it actually makes sense
[06:16:42] <jaubourg> since the request is still active
[06:17:05] * timmywil looks for the ticket
[06:27:47] <timmywil> jaubourg: yea, that makes sense.  were you thinking setTimeout?
[06:28:49] <jaubourg> if we introduce setTimeout we will break a lot of things (global events trigerring is synchronous)... all that because of unchecked exceptions which probably result from programming errors
[06:29:00] <jaubourg> so heh, I'm considering not fixing
[06:29:23] <jaubourg> I think the actual behaviour makes sense
[06:29:44] <jaubourg> the request did not finish
[06:30:30] <jaubourg> (I tested a setTimeout just to see)
[06:31:19] <timmywil> jaubourg: yea, and I don't think the pull presented is viable
[06:31:48] <jaubourg> problem is stack information being lost... and try/finally, well, we know what kind of problems with have with them in deferreds already
[06:31:59] <jaubourg> first with = we
[06:32:38] <jaubourg> (incidently, I removed the try/finally block in the Callbacks branch)
[06:33:07] <timmywil> yea I agree
[06:33:20] <timmywil> and cool!
[06:34:26] <jaubourg> ok, I'll close this as wontfix with an explanation
[06:34:59] <timmywil> brb
[06:49:59] <jaubourg> timmywil: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9585#comment:7
[07:01:11] <timmywil> jaubourg: sounds good
[07:03:20] <jaubourg> cool, glad we could talk about it, I really needed a confirmation of sort ;)
[07:09:50] <timmywil> jaubourg: yea, even if we did want to fix it, I'm not sure we could.  Besides, user errors will get fixed and at that point it's moot.
[07:17:54] <jaubourg> yeah
[07:23:19] <rwaldron> i have to run into a meeting
[07:23:33] <rwaldron> but I hate that requestAnimationFrame patch
[07:23:35] <jaubourg> run run
[07:23:37] <rwaldron> and I wanted to say that
[07:23:39] <timmywil> rwaldron: you might startle them
[07:23:40] <rwaldron> before I go
[07:23:58] <jaubourg> I need to check this
[07:24:03] <rwaldron> 1. IE10 is not even beta, so we dont support it
[07:24:21] <rwaldron> 2. Does IE even ship stable browsers with vendor prefixes?
[07:24:31] <rwaldron> 3. The string literal thing is gross
[07:24:53] <rwaldron> 4. I wrote a vendor prefix function to put in support
[07:24:59] <rwaldron> will file patch later
[07:25:03] <rwaldron> it's pretty saucy
[07:25:06] <rwaldron> later guys
[07:25:12] <timmywil> rwaldron: I'm also concerned with 1 and 3
[07:25:34] <timmywil> but yea, some things do have the ms prefix in stable
[07:33:26] <rwaldron> timmywil cool, thanks for confirming
[07:33:37] <rwaldron> i couldnt find anything with a definitive answer
[07:33:49] <rwaldron> i didnt look very hard
[07:35:30] <timmywil> rwaldron: np :)
[08:03:31] <timmywil> devtools should just show hover/focus/active all the time
[08:03:38] <timmywil> ugh
[15:00:09] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[15:05:00] <timmywil> rwaldron: sup
[16:59:34] <mikesherov> Does anyone know where on the jQuery Trac I can find a list of bugs or features targetted for 1.7 that I can work on?
