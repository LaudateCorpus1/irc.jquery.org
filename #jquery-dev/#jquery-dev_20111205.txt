[08:52:55] <rwaldron> maybe not until 1?
[09:02:27] <rwaldron> timmywil ^^^
[09:02:28] <rwaldron> ?
[09:02:59] <timmywil> rwaldron: dave too?
[09:03:40] <timmywil> that's cool tho, im in a meeting right now too
[09:03:59] <DaveMethvin> k so i don't think there's too much, i updated the agenda
[09:05:37] <rwaldron> meeting just finished
[09:05:44] <rwaldron> but now we have to get into a cab
[09:05:51] <rwaldron> back soon-ish
[14:43:07] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: sorry I missed the meeting today. I had some stuff I had to deal with in the office.
[14:43:24] <DaveMethvin> np
[14:43:29] <mikesherov> I can be around tomorrow to help clean out the pull queue if you'd like
[14:43:39] <DaveMethvin> that would be great
[14:43:50] <DaveMethvin> i need to do some homework tonight :P
[14:44:01] <mikesherov> Are you planning on merging any of mine in? because I can do a rebase on mine ahead of time
[14:44:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would be a good idea
[14:44:48] <DaveMethvin> not a lot has happened lately so it should be easy
[14:45:28] <mikesherov> yeah
[14:45:40] <mikesherov> I did some rebasing when 1.7.1 came out I think
[14:45:50] <mikesherov> but I'll just rebase all of mine to be sure
[14:45:56] <mikesherov> a few are really easy
[14:46:05] <mikesherov> the jQuery.swap is no problem
[14:47:55] <mikesherov> hooray: https://bugs.webkit.org/attachment.cgi?id=117942&action=review
[14:48:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah you are a sweet talker when it comes to fixing browser bugs
[14:48:43] <mikesherov> haha
[14:48:56] <mikesherov> i needed paul_irish
[14:49:07] <mikesherov> i'll just bug him from now on
[14:49:14] <mikesherov> he's the internet
[15:16:59] <paul_irish> mostly i just found someone that had some ownership in the issue
[15:17:04] <paul_irish> which isnt that hard.
[15:17:06] <paul_irish> :)
[17:07:56] <timmywil> asdf
[23:38:55] <Centril> A quite cheap (perf & code-addition) & nice enhancement to jQuery-core would be to add from-element copying functionality to $.attr( ... ) - by checking if the first argument is a jQuery obj or an element... as second argument: a whitespace-separated string-list of attrs to copy, and optionally, an object of callbacks for certain types of attrs...
[23:42:45] <Centril> Also: the returnFalse & returnTrue functions declared before jQuery.Event.prototype could become public functions of the jQuery object (just like jQuery.noop)
