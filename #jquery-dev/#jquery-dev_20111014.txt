[05:22:26] <mikesherov> in css.js, jQuery.swap should return the results of the callback. right now, we're using scoping tricks to work around this
[05:54:35] <mikesherov> I feel like I'm always asking you for something, DaveMethvin
[05:54:51] <mikesherov> but, at your leisure, care to comment on: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10227#comment:7 ?
[05:54:55] <DaveMethvin> was that a question? :P
[05:55:04] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i saw that
[05:55:15] <DaveMethvin> i get emails
[05:55:24] <mikesherov> oh, right
[05:55:33] <DaveMethvin> prolly true that we should just assume block/none
[05:55:49] <mikesherov> k
[05:55:50] <mikesherov> thanks
[06:16:34] <kswedberg> ?tell scott_gonzales status report: I updated the deferred.always() doc
[06:17:38] <kswedberg> hmmm. that didn't seem to work. bot-t: are you there?
[06:37:07] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: bot-t seems flakey lately, plus you meant scott_gonzalez
[06:38:27] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: flaky bot-t, you flake! and yeah, thx for the heads up on the spelling.
[06:38:45] <kswedberg> not that it makes a difference, since bot-t is incognito.
[08:11:55] <gnarf> kswedberg: http://oksoclap.com/1-7-docs
[08:12:09] <gnarf> kswedberg: some quick notes on the things i've changed that need documenting
[08:13:11] <gnarf> hrm
[08:13:18] <gnarf> there is no ticket for one of these changes
[08:13:24] <gnarf> i kinda baked it in with the animate change
[08:13:42] <gnarf> i wonder if i should make .stop( [queue,] clearQueue, gotoEnd ) it's own ticket
[08:13:44] <kswedberg> ok. thx for the notes!
[08:14:08] <gnarf> kswedberg: i promised at least that much this week
[08:14:10] <kswedberg> up to you on the ticket. not needed for docs, but maybe for tracking the feature?
[08:14:25] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: opinion on creating a ticket for this?
[08:15:00] <DaveMethvin> a ticket for the docs, gnarf
[08:15:01] <DaveMethvin> ?
[08:15:21] <gnarf> nah, a ticket describing .stop( [queue,] clearQueue, gotoEnd )
[08:15:48] <gnarf> cuz it snuck in with some other fix because it only made sense if we now allowed animating in multiple queues to allow stopping them
[08:15:53] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, since it was an api change we should have a ticket which your commit closed
[08:21:19] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10497
[08:21:29] <gnarf> look right?
[08:32:40] <DaveMethvin> damn gnarf you didn't even give me a chance to close it wontfix
[08:53:53] <miketaylr> hey timmywil
[08:54:04] <timmywil> hi miketaylr!
[08:54:09] <miketaylr> re: https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/blob/master/sizzle.js#L1246, it's missing oMatchesSelector
[08:54:15] <miketaylr> want me to file bug/pull req?
[08:54:45] <miketaylr> (that was added in 11.50)
[08:54:54] <timmywil> cool, didn't know they had it yet
[08:55:09] <timmywil> yea, ticket/pull would be great
[08:55:17] <miketaylr> cool, thanks
[08:57:52] <timmywil> hahaha, docs#10498
[08:57:54] <bot-t> hahaha, [#10498] matchesSelector is missing oooOOOOOooOOoOOO! (new bug) - http://jqbug.com/10498
[08:58:02] <timmywil> i love tickets from jon neal
[09:01:48] <miketaylr> so good
[09:08:54] <DaveMethvin> so miketaylr was that you? I copied you
[09:09:00] <miketaylr> yeah!
[09:09:26] <DaveMethvin> we need more cartoons in bug reports
[09:09:59] <miketaylr> for reals
[09:21:49] <DaveMethvin> anybody else seeing massive memory leakage in Chrome 14? I have a half-dozen pinned tabs (GMail, Google Calendar/Docs/Reader) and the last few days it works up to 1gb after just a few hours
[10:36:20] <DaveMethvin> OH NOES! They're shutting down Codesearch! http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/10/fall-sweep.html?
[10:38:32] <miketaylr> whoa
[10:38:33] <miketaylr> that sucks
[10:41:06] <miketaylr> friggin google
[11:30:42] <kswedberg> sux!
[11:44:35] <gnarf> hey
[11:44:40] <gnarf> has jaubourg been around at all?
[11:53:14] <gnarf> I'm wondering if we shouldn't make $.Callbacks like purely prototypal
[11:53:48] <gnarf> then use $.proxy to keep the context in copying it over to the $.Deferred methods
[11:54:45] <gnarf> allows a bit of extension to the Callbacks options and what not at run time
[11:55:10] <gnarf> might also reduce some complexity if we can just assume things are on this
[13:58:47] <timmywil> ?tell jaubourg wish i could see you talk again this weekend!
[13:58:48] <bot-t> timmywil, Okay.
[14:11:31] <gnarf> ?twss @timmywil ?
[14:11:32] <gnarf> :)
[14:11:33] <bot-t> gnarf, IRC logs: freenode / #html5 / 20110802 - http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/html5/20110802
[16:02:02] <mikesherov> knock knock
[16:16:25] <mikesherov> knock knock
[16:17:13] <mikesherov> so, I'm going through this open bug by component report... I can pretty much fix all of the css bugs
[16:17:19] <mikesherov> question is, should they be fixes
[16:17:23] <mikesherov> fixed*
[18:23:05] <addyosmani> hey
[18:26:25] <addyosmani> so..it could just be me, but are we missing docs for the new event APIs?
[18:26:41] <addyosmani> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-handler-attachment/
[18:26:53] <addyosmani> I guess I expected .on()/.off() to be on there
[18:27:01] <addyosmani> unless the docs haven't been written up yet / are pending
[18:39:45] <thomasdavis> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5GGVnwAdB0
[18:40:22] <addyosmani> lol
[18:41:11] <addyosmani> bot-t: tell DaveMethvin, do you know if the event API docs for .on/.off have been written yet? Can't seem to find them. If not and anyone needs help getting them out, let me know.
[18:41:12] <bot-t> addyosmani, Okay.
