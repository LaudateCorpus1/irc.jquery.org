[08:44:11] <jaubourg> plop
[09:01:19] <DaveMethvin> jaubourg rwaldron timmywil mikesherov gibson042 gnarf ... meeting time!
[12:37:19] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: whats this trac issue?
[12:37:28] <gnarf> with the list of people to vote?
[12:37:38] <gnarf> thats in some custom JS I think
[12:37:47] <gnarf> might test that they are in a user group?
[12:37:52] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: yeah i am not sure
[12:37:54] <gnarf> TRAC_ADMIN or whatever
[12:38:01] <DaveMethvin> we only deal with it every once in a while
[12:38:12] <DaveMethvin> probably been a year
[12:38:13] <gnarf> last time i think rwaldron maybe did something to let someone vote?
[12:38:37] <DaveMethvin> could be
[12:38:42] <gnarf> is gibson042 already in trac_admin ?
[12:38:50] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[12:39:43] <DaveMethvin> ugh, short of a db query what's the best way to find a user?  the Users page takes forever to load
[12:40:41] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can you read the discussion DaveMethvin and I had in #jqueryui-dev this morning?
[12:42:35] <DaveMethvin> okay, gibson042 has trac_admin ... gibson042 are your votes showing up in the tally?
[12:42:40] <DaveMethvin> lemme find a ticket
[12:43:09] <DaveMethvin> no his votes are not
[12:43:21] <DaveMethvin> i vaguely remember they were wired into a script somewhere
[12:44:44] <DaveMethvin> so scott_gonzalez on that accordion issue it really doesn't seem like rounding to pixels for everyone is the right solution ... if there is a generic thing to solve it might be in animating one element's properties in relation to another element's
[12:44:52] <DaveMethvin> which sounds hard!
[12:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: This is the only thing I've gotten to work: https://gist.github.com/3fcac463560da8765175
[12:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> And I think it's too obtrusive.
[12:45:57] <gibson042> is up arrow/down arrow widget at the top?
[12:46:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you could pass a custom step function
[12:46:35] <DaveMethvin> gibson042: no, i just looked at http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12530 and it didn't seem to register your vote
[12:47:13] <DaveMethvin> there should be a widget below the ticket description
[12:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: The problem is that we're taking advantage of using "show" and "hide" as the values.
[12:47:23] <gnarf> yes
[12:47:31] <DaveMethvin> http://wnd8.com/grab/3a3a1d.png gibson042
[12:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I think I see what you're saying though, let me try something.
[12:49:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: tip: you need to set fx.now = Math.round( fx.now ) in your step
[12:49:33] <gnarf> i think this works in both
[12:49:35] <gnarf> lemme check
[12:49:50] <gnarf> yes
[12:49:56] <gnarf> if you alter the fx.now, it will use it
[12:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> Is that all the way back to 1.6?
[12:50:29] <gnarf> step is called immediately preceding the call to the "set" on the value
[12:50:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/1.6/src/effects.js#L364-372
[12:52:02] <gnarf> step: function( now, fx ) { fx.now = Math.round( now ); }
[12:54:25] <gnarf> you could also check fx.prop if you need to avoid doing this for one of the properties being animated
[12:55:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this is working.
[12:55:20] <scott_gonzalez> I need it for all.
[12:55:35] <scott_gonzalez> But I can probably get rid of the custom accordionHeight property with this idea.
[12:57:59] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...maybe not. I'd need something like the new progress API.
[12:58:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, now, I think this will work actually.
[13:02:08] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: looks like it's me and you on the web builder team
[13:02:25] <danheberden> web builder?
[13:02:32] <danheberden> how do i not remember that table
[13:02:58] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: bah, site builder
[13:03:01] <danheberden> ah
[13:03:02] <ryanneufeld> I fail readying
[13:03:06] <ryanneufeld> and typig
[13:03:46] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: yeah, we need to find out, like, what that actually means
[13:04:07] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: yes, we sure do. I was gonna ask you if you had any idea, but apparently not
[13:04:24] <danheberden> maybe ajpiano knows what he meant when he created it
[13:05:19] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: what is mean 'site build'?
[13:06:20] <ajpiano> it's like
[13:06:25] <ajpiano> anything to do with our web properties
[13:06:28] <ajpiano> that isn't design specific
[13:06:44] <ajpiano> it's like, if you guys had a team of folks and you could have them do anything
[13:06:51] <ajpiano> to help out with our web deployments
[13:06:55] <ajpiano> what you would have them do
[13:07:00] <ryanneufeld> ah, I see
[13:07:32] <danheberden> hmm
[13:07:33] <ryanneufeld> I need to gain a better understanding of the current system
[13:07:44] <ryanneufeld> in order to know what the pain points are
[13:07:56] <ryanneufeld> I just haven't been around long enough I suppose
[13:08:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://gist.github.com/234060ae69568d336c8c
[13:08:21] <danheberden> the bummer part is this work is what should be done *before* all these other people start, you know, work on stuff what would be using said deployment
[13:08:27] <danheberden> *working on
[13:08:35] <danheberden> damn chicken and its fucking egg
[13:09:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: nice
[13:09:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it works?
[13:09:27] <ryanneufeld> the irony for me is that we're going through some similar stuff here at work. Moving from svn to git, and then deploying via git
[13:09:45] <danheberden> mmmm git
[13:09:47] <danheberden> so delicious
[13:11:26] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: we just got a new server, 3.6Ghz xeon quad core HT, 32GB ram, ssd boot, 6TB raid,
[13:11:51] <ryanneufeld> gonna be running vms on that bad boy, should be fun
[13:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yup :-)
[13:12:39] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'll have to add this pro-tip to my "jQuery Animations" talk
[13:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> The adjust value is a bit tricky. It works only because all JS engines keep property order in objects :-P
[13:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/234060ae69568d336c8c#L15 the order here is important.
[13:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> height needs to be the last property set.
[13:13:35] <gnarf> right
[13:13:49] <scott_gonzalez> This is a lot cleaner than my previous solution.
[13:13:52] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks :-)
[13:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> (party)
[13:17:03] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: oh nice
[13:17:23] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: yeah, I was told we'd have a week to do it... I was like LOLWUT
[13:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> I think I'm going to electrify the door knob in the office of my new house. That'll keep the wife and kids out :-P
[13:18:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you need an "ON AIR" light
[13:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> Well, they already know not to come in while I'm working, but that knowledge alone doesn't seem to be enough.
[13:21:53] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: yeah, I'm gonna put a lock on my office door
[13:25:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: bucket of water balanced on the door frame?
[13:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: That could work too, but of course would just end up causing even more distractions for me :-P
[13:26:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: only the first time
[13:26:15] <gnarf> :)
[13:26:18] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:26:32] <ryanneufeld> that sounds risky
[13:26:40] <gnarf> but classic
[13:26:46] <ryanneufeld> the likely hood for collateral damage is high
[13:27:00] <danheberden> or just a magnetic switch on the door so when it's opened it plays a recording of scott going "SERIOUS?"
[13:27:01] <ryanneufeld> not to mention the sleeping-on-the-couch factor
[13:27:04] <danheberden> *SERIOUSLY
[13:27:08] <ryanneufeld> LOL
[13:27:12] <ryanneufeld> That would be good
[13:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I owe you a beer for the accordion animation step idea.
[13:27:20] <ryanneufeld> I like the idea of a lock, and headphones
[13:27:36] <danheberden> i like the idea of a liquor store that delivers
[13:27:53] <gnarf> danheberden: beer-o-gram?
[13:28:03] <ryanneufeld> we had that where i grew up
[13:28:05] <danheberden> bourbon-g-gram
[13:28:14] <ryanneufeld> I used to be a delivery driver
[13:28:26] <ryanneufeld> we'd get calls for all kinds of things
[13:28:53] <ryanneufeld> "Can you go to burger king and get me 3 jr whoppers with tripple mayo, and 7 pickles"
[13:29:11] <ryanneufeld> and if there was 6, or 8, whoa man, you heard about it.
[13:29:35] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: https://www.finewineandgoodspirits.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ShipPolView?catalogId=10051&storeId=10051&langId=-1
[13:30:04] <danheberden> damnit i'm in the wrong state
[13:30:17] <danheberden> i want "we'll have your bourbon to you in 20 minutes or it's free!"
[13:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> You can check the stock of all liquor stores in PA from the LBC site.
[13:31:28] <danheberden> i don't know if that will help me in portland
[13:31:33] <scott_gonzalez> A lot of people don't like state run liquor stores, but I think PA's LCB is AMAZING.
[13:31:53] <danheberden> yeah, we should do that in OR
[13:31:59] <danheberden> though stock isn't normally an issue
[13:32:05] <danheberden> it's, like, getting there before they close
[13:34:14] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: you're on the west coast?
[13:34:23] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: aye
[13:34:24] <scott_gonzalez> The nice thing about being able to check stock is that you can see which store has some random liquor.
[13:34:45] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: Vancouver has a nice bourbon bar I'm told.
[13:35:16] <danheberden> that's like a whole 5 miles away
[13:35:37] <ryanneufeld> more like 5hours
[13:35:49] <ryanneufeld> Vancouver Canadia
[13:36:37] <danheberden> oh, ha
[13:36:57] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, I keep forgetting you guys have one too
[13:38:58] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...setting font size in Sublime Text is strange.
[13:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't matter what font size you have in your user preferences.
[13:40:00] <scott_gonzalez> cmd+= and cmd+- change the font size and don't update that property.
[13:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> And the Preferences -> Font -> Reset menu item resets to the default, not to your user prefs.
[13:44:10] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: it does change it in the file
[13:44:22] <ryanneufeld> but it changes your user prefs file
[13:45:03] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, how about that, it does.
[13:45:18] <ryanneufeld> nifty eh?
[13:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> It just doesn't tell you that the file is out of date if you have it open while you change font size.
[13:45:29] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it just updates it
[13:45:38] <ryanneufeld> it doesn't always tell you the file is out of date
[13:45:46] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so it does work the way that it should :-P
[13:45:47] <ryanneufeld> sometimes it does, and others it doesn't
[13:46:03] <ryanneufeld> i think if you have edited the file, then it tells you it's out of date
[13:46:14] <ryanneufeld> otherwise if you have no local changes, it just updates silently
[13:46:17] <ryanneufeld> I like it
[15:57:26] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: yt?
[16:13:06] <Krinkle> Hey all, I just received the Bowling for jQuery invite, can't help noticing the e-mail has a friggin fixed width.
[16:13:34] <Krinkle> Rather annoying to read in a narrow window (doesn't want to wrap)
[16:14:00] <Krinkle> min-width rather (prolly a table?)
[16:14:38] <Krinkle> wtf, there is an empty table on top with a width of 690
[16:15:10] <Krinkle> <table width="690"  ..></table><p>Hello!, Thanks ..
[16:15:30] <Krinkle> HTML3.2 FTW
[20:43:06] <Krinkle> Awesome, a 500 error on github. that's a first for me
[20:50:10] <Krinkle> https://github.com/search?q=foo%22
[20:50:16] <Krinkle> any unpaired quote makes it throw up
