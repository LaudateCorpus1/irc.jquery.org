[14:59:44] <DaveMethvin> sup m_gol 
[14:59:48] <DaveMethvin> looks like progress
[14:59:51] <m_gol> so I've created branches
[15:00:05] <m_gol> starting from the commit I mentioned earlier and it's equivalent in compat
[15:00:21] <m_gol> I've also cherry-picked a few newer ones that sounded non-breaking and useful
[15:00:34] <m_gol> feel free to do whatever you think it's necessary with it :)
[15:00:39] <DaveMethvin> ok great!
[15:00:41] <DaveMethvin> thanks so much
[15:00:44] <m_gol> np
[15:00:54] <m_gol> I've looked at previous commits
[15:01:04] <m_gol> there were a lot of build-related ones etc., few real fixes
[15:01:18] <m_gol> but there's one for Data perf on master for example, can be useful
[15:01:35] <m_gol> (couldn't find the compat equivalent but it wasn't most likely needed)
[15:01:35] <DaveMethvin> i'm okay with saving the perf ones for 3.0 :)
[15:01:46] <DaveMethvin> no that one was master only
[15:01:50] <m_gol> haha ;)
[15:01:54] <DaveMethvin> it was b/c we used defineProperty
[15:02:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah i was trying to decide whether to put in the ajax one i just landed today
[15:02:16] <m_gol> nah, not this one
[15:02:17] <DaveMethvin> it's got some security implications
[15:02:34] <m_gol> the one that changed jQuery.expando + Math.random(); to jQuery.expando + Data.uid++
[15:02:39] <m_gol> because of the Chrome perf bug
[15:02:42] <DaveMethvin> oh that one
[15:02:44] <m_gol> this is only one line
[15:02:51] <DaveMethvin> i think Chrome may have fixed that?
[15:03:05] <m_gol> hmm, if that's true we might not need that then
[15:03:20] <m_gol> crbug.com/378607
[15:03:23] <DaveMethvin> the new value will be shorter at least 
[15:03:27] <m_gol> Untriaged
[15:03:48] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[15:04:12] <DaveMethvin> okay then i wonder if we do need it there since we still need an expando
[15:04:40] <m_gol> what do you mean?
[15:04:58] <DaveMethvin> well the two data impls are pretty different
[15:05:09] <DaveMethvin> but they do share a *few* things
[15:05:34] <DaveMethvin> i'll look at the commits and see if there are any to pull in
[15:05:42] <m_gol> sure
[15:05:52] <m_gol> I've cherry-picked 4 commits for master & 2 for compat
[15:05:59] <m_gol> you can always remove & force-push
[15:06:01] <DaveMethvin> the main thing that needs to be there is the safari patch but gibson042 should be taking care of that
[15:06:11] <m_gol> I've already force-pushed on those branches so that has happened :P
[15:06:15] <m_gol> sure
[15:06:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah we can abuse these until we ship them :)
[15:06:25] <m_gol> it would be sad if we forgot about that ;)
[15:06:41] <DaveMethvin> no way, not forgetting about that!!!
[15:06:45] <m_gol> haha
[15:07:32] <DaveMethvin> i'll make a ticket with the final list once we figure it out, and tag that in GH issues as 1.11.2/2.1.2
[15:08:33] <m_gol> sure; I haven't changed milestones for now if we decided to back out some commits
[15:08:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah we can do that once we're sure
[15:09:00] <DaveMethvin> i will do it on monday
[15:10:46] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: btw, new iOS 8 & Safari 8 patches went out in the past few days but they didn't contain The Interesting Fix
[15:11:20] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure they did something more important like support Retina 8x (tm) images
[15:11:57] <DaveMethvin> now THAT's significant user impact, not like having correctly functioning JavaScript
[15:12:11] <snover> üëç 
[15:12:33] <m_gol> users don't know what JavaScript is ergo JavaScript correctly functioning is not important to end users, simple
[15:13:03] <DaveMethvin> it's the web sites' fault
[15:13:08] <snover> if you don‚Äôt need it for angry birds
[15:13:10] <snover> then
[15:13:11] <DaveMethvin> they should have made an app
[15:13:11] <snover> who cares
[15:16:06] <m_gol> k, gotta go, enough Safari for one day
[15:16:17] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[15:16:23] <m_gol> see you!

[22:32:57] <gibson042> DaveMethvin|away mzgol: I made a slight mess of the git graph, but sizzle 2.1.0 is published and available.  Right now it looks like we'll get it with bowercopy on 2.1-stable and npmcopy on master and compat. It fixes jQuery issues 1794 and 1874 and the Safari bug (sizzle issue 290; no jQuery issue), in addition to adding Sizzle support for DocumentFragment context
[22:35:17] <gibson042> and I still may release a 2.1.1 in time for jQuery if https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/pull/300 lands tomorrow
