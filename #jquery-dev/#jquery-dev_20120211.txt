[10:34:52] <prometh> ok guys... here's my updated test case... and i still think i'm running into a jquery bug:   http://jsfiddle.net/prometh/NgQ7S/
[10:57:38] <scott_gonzalez> prometh: I think your problem is that you're trying to animate the outer element before adjusting the child elements.
[10:58:02] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery has no way of knowing that you want to animate to a different height, i.e., the height after the children are shown.
[10:58:14] <prometh> cool, ok, i'll try it before
[10:59:36] <prometh> scott_gonzalez: no change
[11:04:00] <prometh> scott_gonzalez: it actually animates with more jumps than before:  http://jsfiddle.net/prometh/NgQ7S/41/
[11:04:05] <scott_gonzalez> I only updated expandListtItem: http://jsfiddle.net/NgQ7S/42/
[11:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> You can't just animate them.
[11:04:25] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery has no way of knowing what size to use then.
[11:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> There's definitely no jQuery bug in your test case.
[11:05:08] <prometh> what the... i don't understand what you did
[11:05:21] <scott_gonzalez> When you call .slideUp/Down()
[11:05:38] <scott_gonzalez> Let's just cover .slideDown()
[11:06:08] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery calculates the height of the element, then essentially does .animate({ height: x })
[11:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> where x = height at the time you called .slideDown()
[11:06:19] <prometh> yes
[11:06:28] <prometh> oh, has to be reset
[11:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> If you're going to change the visible contents of the element, then you need to do that before you call .slideDown().
[11:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm showing/hiding the appropriate contents, then calling .slideDown(), then animating the individual content element.
[11:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> Do you agree now that your test case does not show a bug in jQuery?
[11:09:35] <prometh> now, i think so
[11:09:50] <prometh> but, you've gone really advanced with jquery, imo
[11:09:54] <prometh> i'm trying to catch up
[11:10:51] <prometh> perhaps i could ask a few questions in #jquery ?
[11:11:27] <prometh> 'cuz no one else could help me with what you just did
[11:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[11:11:43] <prometh> :) great
[16:42:44] <mikesherov> .
[16:57:35] <mikesherov> anyone home?
