[12:11:11] <ben_alman> the default, at least
[12:11:21] <ben_alman> like, is this ok? https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init-jquery-sample/blob/master/grunt-sample.jquery.json#L25
[12:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: That's probably fine.
[12:14:20] <scott_gonzalez> We're hoping that people will actually set correct versions, but I doubt it.

[18:28:54] <johnbender> you're listed under the maintainers

[19:33:48] <gibson042> ?tell DaveMethvin I still don't see the official voting widget; if we can't get it sorted out in time just count mikesherov's votes twice and that'll be pretty close ;)
[19:33:49] <bot-t> gibson042, Okay.
[19:34:17] <mikesherov> gibson042 it's hard-coded
[19:34:36] <mikesherov> someone needs to manually hardcode your username in
[19:36:22] <gibson042> wow, what a plugin
[22:19:24] <gnarf> ?tell mikesherov do you know where you hardcode it in? can you do it? (give gibson access to the voting)
[22:19:24] <b-ot> gnarf, I’ll tell mikesherov about that.
