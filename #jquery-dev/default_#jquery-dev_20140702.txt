[07:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: What's the status of JSCS?
[07:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> Back in May, Oleg said we're just waiting for the preset to get updated, but I don't think I've heard anything since then.
[07:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> Is 1.5.7 good to go for all of the jQuery projects?
[08:34:22] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle leobalter: QUnit meeting
[08:34:35] <leobalter> hey
[08:34:52] <Krinkle> hey
[08:35:45] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Looks like, for a chance, I'm finally ahead one step with js frameworks at Wikimedia :P I used to always get to it in jQuery first (smaller scale code-wise, or rather, easier to manage and well-modularised); I just finished rolling to jscs to lots of repos last week.
[08:36:11] <Krinkle> In terms of stability it's doing very well. Only found 2 parser errors so far for false positives, both got fixed in a few days.
[08:36:26] <Krinkle> the preset specifically might need tuning for jQuery though, not sure what the status is of that
[08:36:35] <Krinkle> change*
[08:37:15] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: Yeah, Oleg said "this weekend" on May 16th, but I've yet to hear that the preset is correct :-/
[08:37:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm hoping it was just that he forgot to let us know.
[08:37:40] <scott_gonzalez> I did ping him a few weeks later and he said it was still pending.
[08:37:45] <scott_gonzalez> But it's been a few weeks since then.
[08:37:51] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Give it a try on a repo with just { preset: jquery }. If it's too loose or missing, we can always add more upstream.
[08:37:59] <Krinkle> more rules
