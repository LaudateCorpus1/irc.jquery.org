[10:18:01] <arthurvr> Ansikt: This isnâ€™t jquery development related. Please ask in #jquery, stack overflow, forums, â€¦
[10:18:59] <Ansikt> Oh, sorry, thought this would be the place for questions related to plugins.  I'll go ask on #jquery

[14:47:49] <gmauer> Hi everyone. I'm trying to do some work on jquery for https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1986. I can't seem to get tests running correctly. I can run npm run test, but I'm not sure what exactly that's running.
[14:47:49] <gmauer> The tests I would need to add would be in /test/unit/ajax.js
[14:47:49] <gmauer> Just as a sanity check I add  I add throw "thsi line was hit"; after all the tests are done being declared, but npm run tests still runs just fine
[15:04:41] <m_gol> gmauer: it's in readme: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/#running-the-unit-tests
[15:04:52] <m_gol> gmauer: `npm test` will run just basic tests like linting
[15:05:02] <gmauer> ah
[15:05:13] <gmauer> thanks I must have missed that
[15:17:11] <gmauer> so wait, I tried both grunt watch and npm start, everything always says al good
[15:17:37] <gmauer> I added a throw to the last line of asyncTest( "jQuery.post( String, Hash, Function ) - simple with xml", 4, function() {
[15:21:32] <gmauer> so I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong m_gol
[15:21:54] <gmauer> what should I be seeing in the console while tests run?
[15:22:33] <m_gol> gmauer: not in the console; you need to open a browser in which you want to run tests and point it to the page served by the PHP server you need to launch
[15:22:52] <m_gol> the PHP server needs to point to the jQuery repository folder on your disk
[15:23:01] <gmauer> oooh
[15:23:09] <m_gol> and then you go to http://localhost:port/test/
[15:23:10] <gmauer> oh crap, I need a whole php setup for this?
[15:23:24] <m_gol> since PHP 5.4 or sth you just need pure PHP, no Apache etc.
[15:23:52] <gmauer> hmm
[15:25:43] <m_gol> gmauer: you cd to the repo folder and run `php -S 0.0.0.0:8500` and now you can run the tests via going to http://localhost:8500/test/
[15:26:33] <m_gol> I have more complicated setup, I run Apache with the mod_vhosts module so that I have it all under http://jquery-master.l/test/ but it's not necessary :)
[15:27:00] <m_gol> PHP is unfortunately necessary as AJAX tests have server pages written in PHP
[15:27:09] <gmauer> alright, thank goodness we have chocolatey for windows
[15:27:44] <gmauer> it seems like since node is used for build it would be a good idea to move ajax tests to there as well 
[15:28:05] <gmauer> I assume that's somewhere in the ol backlog
[15:29:21] <m_gol> gmauer: that would be great but we have gazillion of these tests, many written when Node didn't even exist...
[15:30:16] <gmauer> yeah, I know how it goes
[15:31:24] <gmauer> hey, that worked, neat thank you
[15:32:33] <gmauer> so if I want to add a new test for $.post it seems like /test/unit/ajaxjs is an appropriate place, yes?
[15:32:53] <m_gol> yup
[15:33:24] <gmauer> hmm, I'm getting some failed tests, is that normal?
[15:33:52] <gmauer> 5 failed tests
[15:34:42] <gmauer> http://screencast.com/t/KGoUlJHYDl
[15:48:06] <m_gol> gmauer: I get some tests failed as well when I run the server directly via PHP...
[15:50:08] <gmauer> you mean versus apache?
[15:50:12] <gmauer> so I shouldn't worrya bout this
[15:52:23] <m_gol> gmauer: run tests in incognito mode in Chrome; extensions may interfere
[15:52:48] <m_gol> gmauer: but yeah, with Apache they pass; not sure what's causing this simple PHP server to choke here
[15:53:23] <gmauer> ok 
[15:54:07] <gmauer> I also have to restart php often after the first time thigns load up and run it just kind of stalls out
[15:54:15] <m_gol> gmauer: same
[15:59:52] <gmauer> hmm, so I'm nto sure what I should do here. I reset all changes. I run http://localhost:8500/test/?hidepassed&module=ajax in chrome incognitor mode and I get 5 failures
[16:00:20] <gmauer> so I'm not realy sure what to do
[16:01:39] <m_gol> gmauer: do you have a screenshot of these 5?
[16:02:39] <gmauer> http://screencast.com/t/t7lBsa253lEi
[16:04:20] <gmauer> http://pastebin.com/XbgWiGw8
[16:12:12] <m_gol> gmauer: interesting, I have way more than 5
[16:13:15] <m_gol> gmauer: so, it depends on what you want to do with jQuery. :) If it's a one time thing then do what's easier for you, you can ignore those errors and just check your tests pass. if you plan to do more jQuery patches in the future, then setting up a WAMP setup would be better
[17:18:09] <gmauer> so I'm trying to understand the testing infrastructure, what on earth is the expect parameter for asyncTest? the quinit docs are unhelful http://api.qunitjs.com/QUnit.asyncTest/
