[16:02:40] <bot-t1> (9 hours 20 mins ago) <rwaldron> tell mikesherov I cleaned up jshint-check.js... now to start re-writing it.
[16:06:56] <mikesherov> bot-t1: tell rwaldron I'm looking to get a centralized location for the build files, scripts, and order. jshint-check.js should probably check indiv files read from a json objecty
[16:06:57] <bot-t1> mikesherov, Okay.
[16:20:07] <mikesherov> hey there rick
[16:20:15] <mikesherov> I was just bot-t'ing you
[16:20:31] <mikesherov> happy new year
[19:30:58] <mikesherov> .
[19:39:15] <mikesherov> finally!
[19:44:43] <mikesherov> dryed up all of the unit test includes into a single loader file!
[19:45:36] <mikesherov> with the ability to load the src files from code.jquery.com, dist/jquery.js, dist/jquery.min.js, or concatenated from the latest source!
[19:45:44] <addyosmani> In case no one else is around.. *high five* mikesherov
[19:45:55] <mikesherov> Haha!
[19:45:59] <mikesherov> Thanks addy
[19:46:05] <addyosmani> thank *you*
[19:46:05] <mikesherov> submitting the PR now
[19:46:22] <addyosmani> awesome stuff
[19:46:26] <mikesherov> the hardest challenge was get the loader file to work when testing from file://
[19:46:34] <mikesherov> because some people do that
[19:46:47] <addyosmani> ah. I see.
[19:46:53] <addyosmani> any other trouble?
[19:47:20] <mikesherov> not really, except I learned that a lot of the functional tests were outdated
[19:47:28] <mikesherov> the stuff in /test/ that isn't index.html
[19:47:44] <addyosmani> it's good that someone was looking over those then ; )
[19:47:49] <mikesherov> so now I've centralized them to one location, should be difficult for them to get outdated again
[19:47:55] <addyosmani> awesome!
[19:48:39] <addyosmani> It's almost 4am here. I'm off to recharge the ol' batteries.
[19:48:44] <mikesherov> night
[19:48:49] <addyosmani> good work on the pr! later
[19:48:53] <mikesherov> later!
[19:57:23] <DaveMethvin> @mikesherov, AWESOME!!
[19:57:46] <DaveMethvin> i love the comment trick
[19:58:48] <mikesherov> yeah, I was thinking about that one for a few minutes
[19:59:07] <DaveMethvin> i remember a similar trick with perl and batch files from a long time ago
[19:59:19] <DaveMethvin> that is definitely going to come in handy
[19:59:27] <mikesherov> the best part is that you can just put ?jquery=min or ?jquery=dist or ?jquery=1.6 or ?jquery=git
[19:59:31] <DaveMethvin> yep
[19:59:34] <mikesherov> and see how old jqueries worked
[19:59:59] <DaveMethvin> funny b/c i had the javascript part working that way for some other stuff i was playing with
[20:00:03] <mikesherov> yeah
[20:00:19] <DaveMethvin> but doing it with php is just, well, awesome
[20:00:22] <mikesherov> I needed it for the document ready ticket that i was working on
[20:01:00] <mikesherov> I needed to test loading jquery asynchronously, and even doing document.write doesn't cut it
[20:01:14] <mikesherov> I am mainly a PHP developer in my day job
[20:01:21] <DaveMethvin> i was definitely worried about putting document.write into it
[20:01:42] <mikesherov> It only does document.write if you're doing file:// testing
[20:02:08] <mikesherov> so you can wrap tests that need the single file stuff in !isLocal
[20:02:25] <mikesherov> the same way a lot of the ajax stuff is
[20:02:38] <mikesherov> I was talking to Rick about centralizing the build components even further
[20:02:49] <mikesherov> like our makefile shouldn't be doing the concat
[20:03:04] <DaveMethvin> i
[20:03:12] <mikesherov> it should be done in node based off a single json file
[20:03:21] <mikesherov> but that's for another day
[20:03:32] <DaveMethvin> i'd like to have the makefile offer an option to build without effects or ajax, if we can put stubs in for example
[20:03:40] <DaveMethvin> so that way ppl complaining about that can leave it out
[20:03:50] <mikesherov> right
[20:04:27] <mikesherov> at this point, for me, it seems like the makefile should really just be a thin wrapper for node.js
[20:04:38] <DaveMethvin> we are certainly working towards that, for sure
[20:04:43] <mikesherov> yeah
[20:04:47] <mikesherov> chipping away at it
[20:05:13] <mikesherov> happy new year by the way
[20:05:16] <DaveMethvin> anyway, i just saw that commit and had to come in and drool about it...gotta go but have a great new  year!
[20:05:25] <mikesherov> ha, thanks!
[20:05:38] <mikesherov> We can merge it on Tuesday! ;-)
[20:05:42] <mikesherov> happy new years!
[20:05:49] <DaveMethvin> sounds good!
[20:24:14] <mikesherov> bot-t1: tell danheberden I am noticing a lot of mysql errors on the bug tracker when I attempt to open a few tabs at a time. I'm wondering if we're using thread-safe bindings for trac, see here: http://trac.edgewall.org/ticket/3645
[20:24:15] <bot-t1> mikesherov, Okay.
