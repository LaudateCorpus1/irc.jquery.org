[15:56:49] <Foxwell> Hey has anyone ever tried making sprite animations with a fixed position? My navigation on the site I'm building has a fixed pos and the sprites I'm throwing in are just there to kind of pretty it up. It works fine in Firefox and Chrome, but in IE (tested in 8 & 9) the animation lags when using the scrollbar. (This is css sprite animation btw, all on one spritesheet.)
