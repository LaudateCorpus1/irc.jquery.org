[14:54:53] <mikesherov> hmm
[14:55:29] <mikesherov> what is the actual list of browsers jQuery supports
[14:55:35] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: do you know?
[15:04:12] <mikesherov> do we REALLY support safari3, ff2, and ff3?
[16:02:03] <addyosmani> bot-t: tell mikesherov http://docs.jquery.com/Browser_Compatibility, although I have my doubts about how up to date this list is.
[16:02:14] <addyosmani> oh great.
[16:02:17] <addyosmani> no bot-t.
