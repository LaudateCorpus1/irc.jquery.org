[02:13:05] <aaronmcadam> does anyone know of a sensible way to find out if  a method is chainable
[02:13:08] <aaronmcadam> <aaronmcadam> or is there a post about it anywhere?
[02:14:31] <aaronmcadam> ah, if the api docs for the method says it returns jQuery, that should be it right?
[02:29:39] <JKarsrud> basically, yes
[03:30:23] <aaronmcadam> JKarsrud, do u know of a list anywhere? or a way to filter the API?
[03:30:49] <aaronmcadam> I'm always wondering for some functions whether i need to call end()
[04:28:46] <ateam013> hi, any idea whey the divs are not listed, -> they are on the top of each other..;( http://www.pastie.org/2177126

[07:25:23] <kswedberg> I should say, it allowed people who were in others' circles to join. I don't think it was a general public openness

[07:41:15] <aaronmcadam> I'd like to see a book about how to structure jquery apps, dependecy management, etc
[07:41:43] <aaronmcadam> I've started using backbone.js for a jqmobile app but still trying to figure out how to use it properly
[12:04:10] <timmywil_> rwaldron: http://twitter.com/#!/timmywil/status/89044464680697856  :P

[13:23:55] <ryanneufeld> can someone help me out with github?
[13:31:03] <PKKid-Work> ryanneufeld, whats up?
[13:31:16] <ryanneufeld> I think I got it figured out actually
[13:31:21] <ryanneufeld> I think
[13:31:26] <PKKid-Work> ryanneufeld, ok. :)
[13:31:47] <ryanneufeld> well, I did a commit --amend
[13:31:49] <ryanneufeld> on this commit
[13:32:00] <ajpiano> you shouldn't --amend a commit you've alreadypushed
[13:32:08] <ryanneufeld> and it's showing up in the branch I created collapsible-set-fix
[13:32:22] <ryanneufeld> but the diff is wrong on that commit now
[13:32:34] <ryanneufeld> and I'm really just confused as to what happened
[13:33:07] <ajpiano> did you push -f
[13:33:47] <ryanneufeld> yes I did
[13:33:53] <ajpiano> :x
[13:34:05] <ryanneufeld> gnarf told me to!
[13:34:10] * ajpiano hits ryanneufeld on hand with ruler
[13:34:15] <ajpiano> :/
[13:34:20] * ryanneufeld *owie*
[13:34:37] <ryanneufeld> halp?
[13:34:55] <ajpiano> can you make a new branch and push to that , create a new pr based ont aht
[13:35:49] <ryanneufeld> I could just create a new PR with the new code
[13:36:24] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/beatryder/jquery-mobile/commit/a005075cc1519cde61e67fcc4259c8a124b77523#comments
[13:36:28] <ryanneufeld> thats the first one
[13:36:34] <ryanneufeld> which I thought I amended
[13:36:59] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/beatryder/jquery-mobile/commit/92fcbe1672d063129727ce043d194790a5b88fbd
[13:37:02] <ryanneufeld> that's what it should be
[13:37:32] <ajpiano> yea basically i think your pr is probably unsalvageable, just do a new PR
[13:37:39] <ajpiano> easiest way to get to done
[13:37:50] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2043
[13:38:11] <ryanneufeld> when you look at the diff it's right
[13:39:52] <ajpiano> what is wrong, then :/
[13:40:09] <ryanneufeld> nothing
[13:40:15] <ryanneufeld> I'm just confused
[13:40:19] <ryanneufeld> I think I did it right
[13:40:53] <ryanneufeld> I don't understand why the a0057 commit doesn't reflect the change
[13:40:59] <ryanneufeld> when git told me that was the commit I was updating
[13:41:42] <ryanneufeld> Counting objects: 7, done.
[13:41:42] <ryanneufeld> Delta compression using up to 8 threads.

[13:41:49] <ryanneufeld>  + a005075...995ddc9 collapsible-set-fix -> collapsible-set-fix (forced update)
[13:41:59] <ryanneufeld> oops, that was meant for pastebin
[13:42:17] <ryanneufeld> I miss sloppy window focus
[13:42:47] <ryanneufeld> this is the second time I
[13:42:51] <ryanneufeld> have used git
[13:43:04] <ryanneufeld> very different than svn
[13:43:26] <gnarf> ajpiano: you can push -f a branch
[13:43:30] <gnarf> ajpiano: for a pull
[13:43:38] <gnarf> assuming noone has done anything with it
[13:43:40] <ajpiano> and everything is ok?
[13:43:43] <gnarf> ya
[13:43:57] <ajpiano> hm
[13:44:11] <gnarf> but the comment from the "missing" commit is still there
[13:44:36] <ryanneufeld> the updated commit ?
[13:44:41] <ajpiano> could rebase and push -f again ?
[13:44:50] <ryanneufeld> I typed that in through the github ui
[13:45:13] <gnarf> the pull seems right
[13:45:16] <gnarf> it just lost the comment
[13:45:21] <gnarf> because that commit isn't on the pull anymore
[13:46:15] <gnarf> ajpiano: new branch / new pull - or delete old branch and push a new one = same pull request / new commits
[13:52:16] <ryanneufeld> so, is it all good, or did I royally drop the ball?
