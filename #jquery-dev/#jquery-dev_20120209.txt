[07:48:39] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone know why .outerHeight() always returns an integer in Firefox?
[16:19:50] <mikesherov> .
[16:20:07] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[16:20:19] <DaveMethvin> yes!
[16:20:22] <DaveMethvin> sup?

[16:21:11] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov:
[16:21:12] <mikesherov> hi
[16:21:22] <mikesherov> sorry about that
[16:21:52] <mikesherov> I'm still looking to have that commit reverted
[16:22:14] <DaveMethvin> oh rwaldon's commit?
[16:22:27] <DaveMethvin> i was gonna look at the pull queue
[16:22:30] <DaveMethvin> tonight
[16:22:32] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/0944be058e0995d6da066587366fd9ab655764d2
[16:22:33] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by dmethvin (1w, 2d ago): Fix #11257. Correct path to source files.
[16:22:50] <mikesherov> it's not in the pull queue, it breaks it for me in firefox
[16:23:05] <mikesherov> whereas without that change, everything works for me expect latest chrome
[16:23:06] <DaveMethvin> right, kinda related subject tho
[16:23:19] <mikesherov> oh, sure
[16:23:42] <DaveMethvin> when you say "everything" what does that mean?
[16:24:08] <DaveMethvin> so if i test with localhost via a server it works today
[16:24:18] <DaveMethvin> you're saying it breaks locally on firefox?
[16:24:26] <DaveMethvin> ugh, via file:// on ff?
[16:24:32] <mikesherov> correct
[16:24:46] <mikesherov> with my version in there, everything runs fine in FF
[16:25:10] <mikesherov> Rick put in that PR when ben was testing a headless webkit
[16:25:19] <mikesherov> not sure we currently support that
[16:25:42] <DaveMethvin> no we don't
[16:26:20] <mikesherov> so my version *used* to work in all IE's, FF, and Chrome (until recently for me)
[16:26:43] <mikesherov> the error I get in my version on chrome in windows is:
[16:27:18] <DaveMethvin> ok, now i just ran on file:// on firefox 10 on master and it at least *starts* to run correctly ...
[16:27:31] <DaveMethvin> it hangs at the support tests
[16:27:42] <DaveMethvin> but before that patch it dies immediately
[16:28:00] <DaveMethvin> i will try backing it out to recheck but that's what happened to me as i recall
[16:28:48] <mikesherov> so, before Rick's change... aka my change, it stops at support tests on chrome
[16:29:04] <mikesherov> with rick's change in, the tests die immediately
[16:29:33] <DaveMethvin> ok .... hmmm, on master that change is in, and the tests do not die immediately
[16:29:45] <DaveMethvin> just the opposite?
[16:30:28] <mikesherov> I checked out master, with rick's change in, and ran the tests (made sure I cleared cache too), and the tests die immediately
[16:31:08] <DaveMethvin> aaarrrgh ... nothing can be trusted
[16:31:11] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[16:31:22] <DaveMethvin> backed out rick's change, ff seems okay
[16:31:27] <DaveMethvin> chrome does not
[16:31:33] <DaveMethvin> now i need to burn its cache
[16:32:09] <DaveMethvin> no diff, it "hangs" before starting tests
[16:32:55] <mikesherov> hangs
[16:33:01] <mikesherov> not failing test?
[16:33:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah like never starts the test
[16:33:13] <DaveMethvin> new behavior
[16:33:28] <mikesherov> As much as I hate to say this, it seems like we'll have to revert include_js.php
[16:33:59] <mikesherov> because it was working for me as of my change in all browsers, and since rick's change, it's been wonky for me
[16:34:04] <DaveMethvin> ok, i nuked the cache and exited, then restarted and it's behaving
[16:34:11] <DaveMethvin> i think we're dealing with caching effects
[16:34:16] <mikesherov> yes
[16:34:30] <mikesherov> with rick's change, tests break
[16:34:50] <DaveMethvin> is file:// stopping at support tests for you?
[16:35:07] <mikesherov> yes, but for security reasons
[16:35:58] <DaveMethvin> firefox stops at queue:delay
[16:36:52] <mikesherov> with rick's or mine?
[16:37:02] <DaveMethvin> with rick's backed out
[16:37:55] <DaveMethvin> oh crap my apache won't start
[16:37:59] <DaveMethvin> so now i need to reboot
[16:40:51] <DaveMethvin> well here i am again, apache still no workee
[16:41:03] <DaveMethvin> dunno when that happened
[16:41:28] <mikesherov> with rick's, it's trying to include: file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/jquery/test/data/src/core.js
[16:41:37] <mikesherov> which is CLEARLY wrong
[16:42:20] <DaveMethvin> well i have to solve my apache issue before i land anything
[16:42:26] <mikesherov> k
[16:42:37] <DaveMethvin> can't figure what broke it
[16:45:39] <mikesherov> when i finally get my change in, i get: Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/jquery/test/index.html?filter=suppo from frame with URL file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/jquery/test/data/support/boxModelIE.html. Domains, protocols and ports must match.
[16:46:07] <DaveMethvin> SKYPE
[16:48:23] <mikesherov> Ha, I'm on a train at the moment
[16:48:51] <DaveMethvin> it turns out that skype had port 80 open
[16:48:59] <mikesherov> OH
[16:49:48] <mikesherov> ok, so last time, my version works for me everywhere except on chrome with this issue: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=39561
[16:51:00] <mikesherov> this sounds promising: http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=39561#c21
[16:51:20] <mikesherov> more info: http://extremedev.blogspot.com/2011/05/unsafe-javascript-attempt-to-access.html
[16:51:54] <mikesherov> but that's using MY version
[16:52:06] <mikesherov> using rick's version, it stops at support tests because it can't find the right file
[16:52:09] <DaveMethvin> LOL @ this: Chrome treats every file:// URL as its own domain, so each is isolated from all the others. It does this as a security mechanism to prevent one rogue file from being able to access your whole system. Or something.
[16:52:21] <mikesherov> HAHA
[16:52:34] <mikesherov> I think document.domain sounds promising
[16:52:37] <DaveMethvin> ok i have that commit backed out, let me try testing again
[16:53:30] <mikesherov> sorry for all the trouble :-\
[16:53:34] <mikesherov> I just wanted to DRY the test suite
[16:53:37] <DaveMethvin> strange
[16:53:43] <DaveMethvin> try ?filter=data
[16:53:48] <DaveMethvin> do you get a fail on 15?
[16:54:33] <mikesherov> on chrome?
[16:54:48] <mikesherov> yes
[16:55:02] <DaveMethvin> oh it uses a frame
[16:55:09] <mikesherov> yeah
[16:55:22] <DaveMethvin> well then it deserves to die
[16:55:25] <mikesherov> but that's only with rick's backed out :-)
[16:55:41] <mikesherov> with rick's NOT backed out, it won't run even one test on chrome for me
[16:56:18] <mikesherov> actually, for filter=data same
[16:56:32] <mikesherov> with my change, FF passes for file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/jquery/test/index.html?filter=queue
[16:56:45] <mikesherov> which you reporting was hanging, but only with rick's
[16:57:04] <mikesherov> the crux is that mine only fails due to chrome security theatre
[16:57:14] <mikesherov> rick's fails because it can't find the file, and rightfully so
[16:57:26] <mikesherov> it assumes the files are always ../
[16:57:36] <mikesherov> which is exactly what mine attempts to avoid
[16:57:46] <DaveMethvin> i can only figure that there was some strange caching thing b/c i was seeing his succeed
[16:57:55] <mikesherov> hmm
[16:58:13] <mikesherov> I can see mine succeed of FF for filter=delay and fail on rick's
[16:58:58] <mikesherov> I'm going to tinker with document.domain and see if I can't stomp this out so it just works
[16:59:21] <mikesherov> because I'm fairly certain mine works in all cases except for security theatre
[16:59:57] <DaveMethvin> how about if you do a new commit that backs out rick's along with that, and we can test thoroughly
[16:59:59] <mikesherov> if not, I'd recommend we revert include_js.php until we're willing to take the jump to requiring a server-side tech. for testing
[17:00:01] <mikesherov> yeah
[17:00:03] <mikesherov> I will
[17:00:34] <mikesherov> i'll try to get it done tonight
[17:00:43] <mikesherov> should be simple enough
[17:00:50] <DaveMethvin> np, imma look at some of the other recent pull requests
[17:00:53] <mikesherov> thanks

[20:09:30] <prometh> hi.. i think i've found a bug in jquery
[20:09:48] <prometh> my code makes perfect sense, yet when i, say, add an on() after an animate(), it stops working
[20:10:46] <prometh> i'm not entirely sure how to go about writing a ticket for it
[20:10:49] <prometh> if someone could take a look?
[20:11:02] <prometh> it's ~200 lines long..
[20:38:32] <prometh> ?
[20:52:57] <prometh> !!!
