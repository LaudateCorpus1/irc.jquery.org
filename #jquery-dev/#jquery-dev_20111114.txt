[08:32:43] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Fix #10773. Improve parameter handling in removeAttr. - Oleg
[08:38:46] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin timmywil I have to wonder... how much performance penalty does everyone suffer because one person has "parameter paranoia" (I like that ) https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/597/files#L0R359
[08:38:47] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by Orkel (1d, 8h ago): Fix for #10773
[08:39:10] <rwaldron> Because honestly, I look at that and think, "oh, just dont do that"
[08:39:17] <DaveMethvin> well it moved the lowercase to outside the loop so that was a plus
[08:39:21] <rwaldron> but instead, we now run it through trim
[08:39:25] <rwaldron> which has regex's
[08:39:28] <timmywil> but added a trim
[08:39:28] <bot-t1> (20 hours 40 mins ago) <ryannneufeld> tell timmywil someone was asking about this bug: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10662#comment:3 I think I found something worth close investigation
[08:40:37] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/UYRFXg
[08:40:37] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Ensuring that nulls in private data object won't cause errors on stop() - Fixes #10750 - Corey Frang
[08:41:00] <timmywil> I might have shortened all of that to just the `value &&` and moving toLowerCase
[08:41:33] <timmywil> the rest is really invalid
[08:41:36] <DaveMethvin> well that one in particular didn't bother me too much but I think we need people to balance between the overhead of us dealing with a pr and the value of whatever is fixed by that pr
[08:42:04] <DaveMethvin> i'm not attached to that if you feel like tweaking it
[08:43:42] <rwaldron> does the issue arise that `name` is "" when split(" ") leaves a "hole" (sortof?)
[08:43:56] <rwaldron> instead of trim, maybe just check that `name` isn't ""
[08:44:45] <rwaldron> a condition for checking value is less overhead then jQuery.trim()
[08:44:50] <rwaldron> timmywil ^ ?
[08:46:23] <timmywil> the `value &&` would handle emptry string
[08:46:42] <timmywil> I don't think we really need the trim
[08:47:16] <rwaldron> the problem was... after value is split
[08:47:22] <rwaldron> value && is before
[08:47:31] <rwaldron> well, it was two fold
[08:47:37] <DaveMethvin> well i dunno maybe we don't need the value && either if that's the case
[08:47:45] <DaveMethvin> and just .toLowerCase() the thing
[08:47:52] <DaveMethvin> if it isn't a string, they made a mistake
[08:48:01] <DaveMethvin> an empty string
[08:48:43] <DaveMethvin> but this is why i hate these kind of commits, we have a lot more important things in the queue than whether we can rescue people using our apis incorrectly
[08:48:56] <timmywil> we do handle passing vars into methods and covering for them often
[08:48:57] <rwaldron> agreed
[08:49:14] <timmywil> covering empty string is easy
[08:49:28] <timmywil> and value && is fast
[08:49:34] <timmywil> trim is an extra function call we don't need
[08:50:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah i guess my point is that unless this pr came up we wouldn't even bother with this
[08:50:49] <rwaldron> also, there were no tests for this and I blame myself, but switching from rspace to " " changed the semantics as well
[08:50:52] <DaveMethvin> so i dunno maybe we should just close more of these ones that we don't think are high value
[08:51:14] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin +1
[08:51:19] <rwaldron> actually, +9001
[08:52:16] <DaveMethvin> hey let's talk about it in the meeting then and come up with an approach for the prs, we can go through the list of ones we have
[08:52:28] <rwaldron> sounds good
[08:52:46] <timmywil> ok
[08:53:31] <jaubourg> I have to take a shower but I come right back for the meeting
[08:53:42] <jaubourg> I may be a bit late
[08:54:00] <jaubourg> you guys are sooo happy to know about my showering habits, right?
[08:54:04] * jaubourg hides
[08:55:53] <DaveMethvin> i didn't even know the french HAD showers
[08:59:08] <rwaldron> jaubourg <3333
[09:01:14] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: they don't.  he's in belgium
[09:01:58] <timmywil> belgians have better grooming habits
[09:03:13] <rwaldron> jaubourg is motivated by love
[09:03:25] <DaveMethvin> ok, meeting, head over there ====>
[09:14:24] <jaubourg> showers are the new black in europe right now :P
[09:14:27] * jaubourg hides again

[09:37:33] <danzik17> fyi ( dont want to butt in the meeting), just close my PR on the build order thing - in retrospect a ticket woulda been the right place to start a discussion in the first place, not a PR ( it was more intended of an idea, there's obvious problems with my re-ordered file that mikesherov pointed out )
[09:38:20] <jaubourg> idea of re-ordering is awesome just so you know
[09:38:29] <jaubourg> we just need to handle it properly
[09:38:31] <danzik17> <3
[11:08:58] <DaveMethvin> hey jaubourg: thought you would be tickled to know that the Amazon Kindle Reader uses your $.jsonp plugin ... also makes heavy use of jQuery 1.5.1 and Deferred
[11:31:51] <tbranyen> thats awesome
[11:46:12] <ryanneufeld> timmywil: you get my tell/
[11:46:13] <ryanneufeld> ?
[11:46:38] <timmywil> ryanneufeld: yup, answer on the ticket
[11:46:48] <ryanneufeld> k, now I gotta find it :p

[11:48:21] <ryanneufeld> Thanks, yeah that's pretty much what I thought was the problem
[11:48:38] <ryanneufeld> just lends to the argument of using a normalized css for projects
[11:49:18] <ryanneufeld> timmywil: appreciate the second look. Have a good one!
[11:49:35] <timmywil> ryanneufeld: thanks you too :)
[11:50:48] <timmywil> kswedberg: moderated jquery-meeting
[11:51:06] <kswedberg> thx, timmywil.
[11:51:14] <timmywil> np
[12:39:46] <clarkbox> gnarf, need some git help
[12:40:14] <clarkbox> within jquery repo, run this:
[12:41:52] <clarkbox> git branch -r;git checkout 1.4
[12:42:26] <clarkbox> then git checkout 1.4.1
[12:42:47] <clarkbox> it warns me that changed to local files etc.... aborting
[12:43:22] <clarkbox> this is from a fresh run of the script. i have not made changes. how can i get around that in the script?
[12:48:40] <danheberden> clarkbox - `git checkout -f origin/master` ( or whatever branch it is ) should force it
[12:49:18] <clarkbox> k ill give that a go
[12:50:39] <danheberden> if that doesn't do the trick, you can force a head by git checkout -f `cat/refs/remotes/origin/master`
[12:51:24] <danheberden> oops, `cat .git/refs/remotes/origin/master`
[15:00:57] <mikesherov> hello
[15:05:57] <clarkbox> why does "git reset --hard origin/XtagX" not work?
[15:06:10] <clarkbox> it works fine with branches
[15:06:37] <clarkbox> but on a branch i get git reset --hard origin/1.7b2;
[15:06:37] <clarkbox>  fatal: ambiguous argument 'origin/1.7b2': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
[15:06:37] <clarkbox> Use '--' to separate paths from revisions
[15:07:23] <clarkbox> removing origin seems to work... but does that do the _right_ thing?
[15:08:05] <mikesherov> put a space instead of a /
[15:08:37] <clarkbox> git reset --hard origin 1.4.1;
[15:08:37] <clarkbox>  fatal: Cannot do hard reset with paths.
[15:25:47] <aaronmcadam> guys is this possible with what we have: Live Query also has the ability to fire a function (callback) when it matches a new element and another function (callback) for when an element is no longer matched
[15:26:24] <ajpiano> no
[15:26:47] <aaronmcadam> cool just I was telling some guy to stop using livequery and he said he was using it for that
[15:27:10] <aaronmcadam> and remembered I tried looking at doing that before
[15:30:00] <aaronmcadam> ajpiano: ahhh I know how it works now, very bad
[15:43:18] <timmywil> clarkbox: git reset --hard 1.4.1
[15:43:38] <clarkbox> no origin needed?
[15:43:39] <clarkbox> ok
[15:44:17] <clarkbox> gnarf (or anyone) please test out the new script and provide feedback - http://pastebin.com/Jcf8sppi
[15:44:46] <clarkbox> only thing i am unsure of now is if this will remove files that have been deleted from the repo?
[15:45:01] <gnarf> clarkbox: it should with a reset --hard
[15:45:11] <gnarf> but you're then doing a checkout-index
[15:45:21] <gnarf> just remove the directory before you checkout-index it or whatev
[15:45:27] <clarkbox> ya
[15:45:45] <clarkbox> thats what i was thinking. i cant find an option for that in checkout-index
[15:46:03] <gnarf> whatever it is, the sooner we can get http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/... working agin, the less broken links we have all over the internet
[15:46:05] <clarkbox> so i guess ill have to "rm -fr target'
[15:46:36] <clarkbox> i dont know mask
[15:46:55] <gnarf> when you added the branches/ to the path you broke a ton of external links :)
[15:47:12] <clarkbox> oh ok. ill undo that change today
[15:47:28] <clarkbox> its too bad because those directories make things much cleaner
[16:13:58] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: good to know about the Amazon Kindle Reader
[16:14:08] <jaubourg> how did you find out?
[16:14:44] <ajpiano> the mainframe... he hacked it
[16:15:02] <jaubourg> aaaaaaah
[16:15:12] <jaubourg> tron helped I gather?
[16:17:01] <ajpiano> one can only assume
[16:19:53] <jaubourg> http://green.autoblog.com/2011/11/11/evolve-motorcycles-launch-xenon-light-bike-and-reveal-lithium-a/ OMG scroll down
[16:40:17] <clarkbox> ok gnarf http://view.jqueryui.com/ should be the way you want it now
[17:10:09] <clarkbox> http://view.jquery.com is now up
[17:10:19] <clarkbox> however github file-uri does not work
[17:10:35] <clarkbox> not sure what to do about that - maybe remove that feature?
[17:11:25] <clarkbox> otherwise will need to revise the JS that makes that happen - everything is hard coded to the jquery UI repo
[17:11:36] <clarkbox> who build that JS?
[17:11:39] <clarkbox> built
[17:24:36] <rwaldron> jaubourg are we gonna get those bikes when you move to the US?
[17:24:42] <rwaldron> and start a gang??
[17:35:09] <rwaldron> timmywil yt?
[17:35:16] <rwaldron> that spreadsheet is locked right?
[17:35:50] <timmywil> rwaldron: it is
[17:36:05] <timmywil> rwaldron: i see i have the popular answer
[17:36:15] <rwaldron> hahahaha
[17:36:29] <rwaldron> let me guess...
[17:36:37] <rwaldron> you expect: empty, 0, Rick, 1
[17:36:45] <timmywil> yup
[17:36:47] <rwaldron> me too
[17:36:58] <rwaldron> some folks seem to think otherwise
[17:37:06] <rwaldron> I'm going to make them feast on words
[17:37:18] <timmywil> haha, i figured :)
[17:38:40] <timmywil> rwaldron: people at esdiscuss think have this opinion?
[17:38:44] <timmywil> -think
[20:11:25] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/601
[20:11:26] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by mikesherov (50.851s ago): Switch to JSHint instead of JSLint, fixes #10692
[20:12:37] <mikesherov> The JSHint revolution starts now
[20:50:18] <mikesherov> rwaldron: you here?
[20:51:17] <rwaldron> yo
[20:51:36] <rwaldron> space and tabs mixing in comments makes me stabby
[20:51:45] <rwaldron> i deal with that in my own projects all the time
[20:51:57] <rwaldron> sucks when i want to comment a big block
[20:51:59] <rwaldron> anyway...
[20:52:54] <mikesherov> so made those changes
[20:53:07] <mikesherov> right now, I'm trying to turn on "undef"
[20:53:10] <mikesherov> 93 errors
[20:53:21] <rwaldron> nice
[20:53:29] <rwaldron> i like that
[20:53:39] <rwaldron> means there will ne 93 less errors
[20:53:44] <rwaldron> be*
[20:53:48] <mikesherov> it happens when var a = function(){c=b},c,b;
[20:54:01] <mikesherov> which isn't really an error
[20:54:15] <mikesherov> but a pervasive anti-pattern in ajax.js and events.js
[20:54:22] <rwaldron> this last set looks good
[20:54:26] <rwaldron> of commits
[20:54:30] <mikesherov> cool
[20:55:03] <mikesherov> 93 is now 64
[20:55:09] <rwaldron> well, technically, we're supposed to put the initialized, but undefined vars first
[20:55:14] <rwaldron> so...
[20:55:17] <mikesherov> right
[20:55:22] <mikesherov> that's the RIGHT way
[20:55:26] <rwaldron> var c, b, a = function(){c=b};
[20:55:32] <rwaldron> but that diverged
[20:55:41] <rwaldron> no better time to fix it
[20:56:04] <rwaldron> there are probably going to be a lot of undefs for document
[20:56:08] <rwaldron> setTimeout
[20:56:15] <rwaldron> shit like that
[20:56:25] <mikesherov> well, what happens in the WORST case is: var a = function(tmp){c = tmp}, b, c = a(somevar);
[20:56:39] <rwaldron> ew
[20:56:46] <mikesherov> well, there is a JSHint option called "browser"
[20:56:57] <mikesherov> that assumes setTimeout
[20:57:10] <rwaldron> does that override the use of setTimeout in a closure?
[20:57:15] <rwaldron> i've never used it
[20:57:18] * rwaldron shrugs
[20:57:26] <mikesherov> and for exports.js, you can say /*global define:true*/
[20:57:40] <rwaldron> right, I'm hip to those settings
[20:57:41] <mikesherov> which will say that "define" is defined somewhere else
[20:57:47] <mikesherov> cool
[20:58:02] <rwaldron> i guess in my own projects I dont mind making explicit shorthands to window.* stuff
[20:58:10] <rwaldron> because its better compression in the end
[20:58:17] <mikesherov> yeah, agreed
[20:58:24] <rwaldron> localizing... var foo = window.foo;
[20:58:40] <rwaldron> now all |foo| can be crunched to "A" or whatever
[20:59:26] <rwaldron> ugh
[20:59:30] <rwaldron> i need to go to bed
[20:59:48] <rwaldron> i'm speaking for the jquery summit in the AM
[21:00:04] <rwaldron> http://www.environmentsforhumans.com/2011/jquery-summit/
[21:00:22] <rwaldron> get 20% off with: 20RICK if you want
[21:02:32] <mikesherov> Cool, thanks
[21:02:39] <mikesherov> good luck tomorrow
