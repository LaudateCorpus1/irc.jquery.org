[05:48:56] <Krinkle> Anyone here know whether it is supported that jQuery css resolves vendor prefixes?
[05:49:06] <Krinkle> I can't find it anywhere in the docs
[05:49:08] <Krinkle> I know it does it
[05:49:14] <Krinkle> http://api.jquery.com/css/
[05:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: It was added in 1.8, and is officially supported.
[05:52:17] <m_gol> Krinkle: it was mentioned in 1.8 blog post
[05:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> File a ticket against the API site.
[05:52:31] <Krinkle> k
[05:52:37] <scott_gonzalez> Here's the relevent ticket: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10679
[05:52:48] <Krinkle> I was going to fix it somewhere and like, well, I don't want to not have a reference
[05:53:06] <Krinkle> thx
[05:53:09] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[05:54:22] <Krinkle> m_gol: well, "mentioned". The bullet point for the bug fix. Or do you mean something more elaborate
[05:54:30] <Krinkle> ah, I see it.
[05:54:36] <Krinkle> Looked for the word "Vendor" instead of "Prefix"
[05:54:40] <m_gol> :)
[05:54:43] <Krinkle> Nnice
[05:54:44] <Krinkle> Nice
[06:58:22] <scott_gonzalez> Who uses Stack Overflow?
[06:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> Am I supposed to get any kind of notification when someone comments on my answer?
[07:01:21] <scott_gonzalez> Nevermind, I found the answer on meta stackoverflow o_O
