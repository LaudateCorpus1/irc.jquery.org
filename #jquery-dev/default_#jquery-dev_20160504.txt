[13:25:28] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: That guy really wants to avoid removing the HTML injection, huh?
[13:25:47] <DaveMethvin> i guess?
[13:26:01] <scott_gonzalez> He doesn't seem to understand that the cost of modifying the DOM can be relative to the size.
[13:26:11] <DaveMethvin> i think the html forces a dirty layout and getElementFromPoint makes it recalc the layout
[13:26:26] <DaveMethvin> since the status is at the TOP of the document the x/y can change
[13:26:47] <DaveMethvin> i suppose chrome has some optimization realizing that the height didn't change or something
[13:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> It's certainly possible.
[13:27:09] <DaveMethvin> plus he's doing it in the event handler, so it's updating html several times per FRAME
[13:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, lag is gone in your code.
[13:27:21] <DaveMethvin> when it should use rAF to throttle
[13:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> This is when you feel like yelling, right?
[13:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> "What did you change?"
[13:27:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah i just want him to try my example and see that it's not the DOM size directly, but the fact he's forcing layout
[13:28:05] <DaveMethvin> and that shows even in the chrome trace
[13:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, he just responded saying the lag is gone.
[13:28:18] <DaveMethvin> oh boy!
[13:31:32] <leobalter> scott_gonzalez: I am super ++ to add that email to the Standards repo if you want to open that discussion
[13:32:15] <scott_gonzalez> leobalter: Should I just file it as an issue and we'll tweet it?
[13:33:08] <leobalter> I think so, yes. 
[13:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok, will do
[13:33:33] <leobalter> The current Readme still does not reflect it well, but I'm planning to update it this week

[19:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: you around?
[19:05:30] <DaveMethvin> yep
[19:05:41] <scott_gonzalez> So, this is gonna sound like a crazy question, but...
[19:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> Is it possible to rewrite the entire event system as a plugin?
[19:06:08] <scott_gonzalez> Is it fully self-contained?
[19:06:28] <DaveMethvin> are you drinking again
[19:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[19:06:42] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[19:06:47] <DaveMethvin> it's got hooks into other stuff
[19:06:51] <DaveMethvin> like clone() clones events
[19:07:13] <scott_gonzalez> But it's agnostic of the structure that it's cloning, right?
[19:07:13] <DaveMethvin> so some of the interfaces are only internal
[19:07:27] <DaveMethvin> and it uses the internal data() object
[19:07:33] <DaveMethvin> which can't be accessed from outside
[19:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> hmm, that would be problematic.
[19:08:09] <DaveMethvin> the main problem is that so many outside ppl are now looking at the internal data structure
[19:08:19] <DaveMethvin> so it could be changed only with a lot of coordination
[19:09:14] <scott_gonzalez> Well so much for that idea :-P
[19:09:50] <DaveMethvin> in jquery 4 we are going to need to change that stuff if we are going to support passive listeners etc
[19:10:16] <scott_gonzalez> Right. I was wondering if it'd be possible to do that prior to 4.0 via a plugin that replaces the entire event system.
[19:10:19] <DaveMethvin> and we can stop using our own triggering, move to native trigger
[19:10:23] <scott_gonzalez> But seems like the answer is no.
[19:10:32] <DaveMethvin> not without breaking a lot of outside code
[19:10:43] <DaveMethvin> maybe for some subset of things
[19:11:11] <DaveMethvin> we can't even get wordpress sites to quote #
[19:11:26] <DaveMethvin> if you change the internal ds it will break firefox dev tools
