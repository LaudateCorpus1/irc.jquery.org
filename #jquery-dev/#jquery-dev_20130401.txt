[10:10:11] <gnarf> JamesMGreene: you around?
[10:10:26] <JamesMGreene> off and on
[10:10:49] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: sorry i was laying down during the meeting, tooth is providing me with a few hours of normalcy today, last hour wasn't one of them
[10:11:36] <gnarf> JamesMGreene: I got another public IP setup on the helix now, so I can setup a jenkins.jquery.com if we want - try to start moving things off of jq03 one at a time to see if we can isolate our issues

[11:06:56] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez y u so hung up on tabz keyz??
[11:06:56] <b-ot> rwaldron: (Â±Æ'–î')Â±Æ
[11:14:04] <JamesMGreene> gnarf: Sorry, it's a busy work day today
[11:14:28] <gnarf> JamesMGreene: same, lets try to get together and chat about a plan with j√∂rn or krinkle
[11:14:30] <JamesMGreene> gnarf: Is moving Jenkins to a [final] helix box the long-term goal anyway?
[11:14:50] <JamesMGreene> Or is this just because of our PhantomJS Virtuozzo issues?
[11:48:06] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez ping
[11:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> hey rwaldron
[11:48:17] <rwaldron> i was going to post to that thread, but I dont want to
[11:48:27] <rwaldron> jQuery.param is what you were thinking of
[11:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the PlainObject/Object/Anything thread?
[11:48:46] <rwaldron> where PlainObject is definitely treated differently from object
[11:48:49] <rwaldron> yes
[11:49:02] <rwaldron> observable with boxed primitives
[11:49:14] <rwaldron> I'm sure there are others
[11:49:20] <rwaldron> but that's off the top of my head
[11:49:44] <rwaldron> re: that events thread
[11:49:52] * rwaldron facepalm
[11:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to dig up the WHATWG/W3C thread (can't remember which list it was on) when this was proposed for DOM.
[11:50:51] <scott_gonzalez> But I didn't feel like exerting any more effort.
[11:50:53] <rwaldron> I'm shocked by that dude's responses
[11:51:03] <rwaldron> at first I thought he was just playing us
[11:51:05] <rwaldron> for April 1
[11:51:19] <rwaldron> but then I saw that the conversation started well before today
[11:51:26] <scott_gonzalez> I like how he says that .hide() animations are equivalent to getting a list of events.
[11:53:05] <rwaldron> fundamental points of computational theory...
[11:53:14] <rwaldron> maybe that's too abstract
[11:53:41] <rwaldron> basically, he wants side channels and he wants jQuery to fully support them
[12:22:31] <JamesMGreene> Anyone know why that BlueImp dude deletes all the old versions (tags/branches) of his jQuery FileUpload plugin?  It's kinda infuriating

[14:36:30] <Krinkle> gnarf: JamesMGreene: What's up?
[14:36:54] <gnarf> Krinkle: I want to move Jenkins onto an instance on the helix test server
[14:37:06] <gnarf> see if we get better perf/reliability
[14:37:10] <Krinkle> OK
[14:37:26] <gnarf> is there a day this week that works well for you?
[14:37:29] <gnarf> and or time
[14:37:30] <Krinkle> I roughly know what that means and suspect ^, indeed due to memory issues and perf. 
[14:37:31] <gnarf> to be around
[14:37:34] <Krinkle> What do you need me to do?
[14:37:52] <gnarf> just help solve whatever issues we might have with the process
[14:38:01] <gnarf> like, do we move swarm at the same time
[14:38:01] <gnarf> etc
[15:09:22] <Krinkle> gnarf: I'd like to keep swarm where it is since it is mostly unpuppetised. Need to better get that documented before moving
[15:09:37] <Krinkle> Jenkins should be fairly easy.
[15:09:49] <Krinkle> gnarf: It would live on a different 
[15:09:57] <Krinkle> gnarf: Jenkins will change public end point, not?
[15:10:04] <Krinkle> Or can it stay on the same domain/port?
[15:10:19] <Krinkle> we'd have to proxy it somehow, though I suspect that is in place already since they're all VMs
[15:10:26] <Krinkle> not sure if that's on a level we control, though.
