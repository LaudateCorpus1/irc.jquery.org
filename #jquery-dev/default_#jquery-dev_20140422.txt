[04:47:09] <m_gol> DaveMethvin|away: lol, I see you finally made jquery-release work on Windows
[04:47:19] <m_gol> DaveMethvin|away: by installing a Linux VM :P

[05:27:44] <m_gol> jzaefferer: ping
[06:13:25] <DaveMethvin> no wonder trac is always slow and unreliable, it's being pounded with several spam posts per second: http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/807bd0.png
[06:18:30] <m_gol> :/
[06:18:34] <m_gol> should we add captcha or sth?
[06:18:46] <m_gol> at least during account creation
[06:19:05] <DaveMethvin> if i knew how to do that ... yes
[06:19:19] <DaveMethvin> some robot is creating about 15 accounts per day
[06:19:34] <m_gol> https://trac-hacks.org/wiki/RecaptchaRegisterPlugin ;)
[06:20:03] <DaveMethvin> cool, now i just need to figure out how to install it
[06:20:14] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if UI uses captcha on accounts
[06:20:29] <DaveMethvin> nope
[06:20:53] <m_gol> do we have a retry on Karma tests in Sizzle?
[06:20:58] <m_gol> IE9 disconnects for me often
[06:21:04] <m_gol> but I don't see an attempt at reconnecting
[06:21:08] <m_gol> and I think Karma supprots it
[06:21:11] <m_gol> markelog ^^^
[06:22:19] <m_gol> so I see you went with rc2
[06:22:26] <m_gol> seems like a good idea
[06:23:12] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: as for the checks during release I'd first check if the latest tag is used and only then if there are new commits on Sizzle
[06:23:28] <m_gol> if even the tag doesn't match, we almost always have a problem
[06:24:10] <DaveMethvin> well plus it's a warning, so it doesn't hurt to stop and think about it
[06:24:23] <m_gol> man, IE9 constatnly disconnects for me in BrowserStack :/
[06:24:33] <m_gol> `grunt` on the Sizzle repo fails because of that
[06:25:25] <m_gol> WAT
[06:25:25] <b-ot> m_gol: is it possible to a object of swfobject render itself?
[06:25:26] <m_gol> ERROR [launcher.browserstack]: Can not establish the tunnel.
[06:26:40] <JamesMGreene> b-ot: wat? o_O
[06:27:16] <JamesMGreene> WAT
[06:27:16] <b-ot> JamesMGreene: is it possible to a object of swfobject render itself?
[06:27:22] <m_gol> if our test infrastructure works, BrowserStack fails :D
[06:27:25] <m_gol> always something
[06:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> Do not add CAPTCHA.
[06:38:14] <scott_gonzalez> CAPTCHA hasn't been a good idea for almost a decade.
[06:38:20] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: we're getting pounded
[06:38:28] <scott_gonzalez> It won't help much.
[06:38:34] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: so why is Google using it, like, everywhere?
[06:39:02] <scott_gonzalez> Where does Google use it?
[06:39:18] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, all it does is provide something that bots can beat and annoys humans.
[06:39:25] <DaveMethvin> ui's spam filtering log: http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/5481e4.png
[06:39:27] <scott_gonzalez> Also pretty terrible for accessibility.
[06:39:30] <DaveMethvin> core's log: http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/afb9c0.png
[06:39:44] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: their bug tracker, creating a Google account, etc.
[06:39:49] <DaveMethvin> you're getting a couple of submits per day, we get a couple per minute
[06:40:13] <DaveMethvin> i just turned on IP filtering which ui had turned on
[06:40:18] <DaveMethvin> but it looks to be bogus to me
[06:40:34] <DaveMethvin> b/c the ip is 127.0.0.1 in both tracs
[06:40:51] <DaveMethvin> so i fear that spammers can just crank up the volume and cut everyone off 
[06:40:56] <DaveMethvin> not sure how that measure works
[06:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it looks like someone changed the settings that I put in for UI.
[06:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> So I don't know what the reasoning is behind the current settings.
[06:42:39] <DaveMethvin> most of them are the same for ui and core
[06:42:41] <scott_gonzalez> This is what I did: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/247#issuecomment-37326072
[08:01:40] <DaveMethvin> just FYI i'll be traveling most of the week, not on IRC too much until Saturday I suspect

[14:29:23] <brunoais> Hey, http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/15049
[14:29:30] <brunoais> how do I edit this?
[14:29:35] <brunoais> It is missing many breaklines
[14:29:43] <brunoais> any clues?
[14:30:24] <m_gol> brunoais: [[BR]]
[14:30:31] <m_gol> there is a button for that
[14:33:36] <brunoais> m_gol, I know
[14:33:43] <brunoais> I just cannot find the button to edit it
[14:34:07] <brunoais> I only found that out when I was re-reading now
[14:34:12] <brunoais> m_gol, ^
[14:57:01] <gnarf> brunoais: rwaldron is right though - jQuery .change() is not meant to trigger non jQuery change events
[14:57:43] <gnarf> trigger() and all of its aliases only work with jQuery bound events
[14:58:35] <gnarf> we don't make real dom events because even with recent browsers, there are quite a few restrictions to javascript created events that are kind of a nightmare, so we just rely on our own trigger implementation
[22:28:04] <brunoais> gnarf, sorry I had to go to bed. It was getting late
[22:28:13] <brunoais> What kind of things?
[22:28:43] <brunoais> Why doesn't the manual mention that? From what I can read, it should be doing the DOM event.
[22:35:53] <brunoais> JamesMGreene, 
[22:35:57] <brunoais> can you help me?
[22:36:01] <brunoais> "As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the DOM tree"
[22:36:18] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/j59Qk/1/
[22:36:22] <brunoais> this does not work
[22:36:25] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/j59Qk/
[22:36:29] <brunoais> this is using only the DOM
[22:36:37] <brunoais> bug?
[22:38:07] <brunoais> sorry wrong version
[22:38:09] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/j59Qk/2/
[22:38:13] <brunoais> this is the 1st one
[22:45:11] <brunoais> ok. Let me restart
[22:45:16] <brunoais> these ones I tested and confirmed
[22:45:31] <brunoais> The manual says:
[22:45:38] <brunoais> "As of jQuery 1.3, .trigger()ed events bubble up the DOM tree"
[22:46:09] <brunoais> and I relied on that job with custom triggered events directly on the DOM
[22:47:02] <brunoais> Then a "section" of the program was changed to something using jQuery
[22:47:10] <brunoais> an equivalent of this:
[22:47:16] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/bA7MB/
[22:47:20] <brunoais> happens there
[22:47:31] <brunoais> while previously something like this:
[22:48:08] <brunoais> http://jsfiddle.net/brunoais/bA7MB/2/
[22:48:11] <brunoais> was there
[22:49:11] <brunoais> If this isn't a bug, then did you change the specification of jQuery without updating the manual?
