[02:23:14] <markelog> ping rwaldron
[04:27:14] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin|away: I can't find it in the docs. Maybe it's supposed to be a private API?
[07:32:05] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: any luck on the problem with sinon timers?
[07:48:49] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: sorry, I've missed markelog comment that his commit didn't solve the issue... I can look into it in about 2-3 hours
[07:48:58] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks
[08:00:35] <rwaldron>  markelog pong
[08:00:37] <rwaldron> hi!
[08:03:04] <markelog> I heard from the colleague who is in touch with some TC39 members
[08:03:11] <markelog> That there is some rumbling from some members about Domenic promise spec
[08:03:19] <markelog> Promise spec still sheduled to be included in the next draft?
[08:03:58] <markelog> rwaldron: i thought it's a done deal already
[08:04:04] <markelog> is it not?
[08:05:24] <markelog> m_gol: you in for a treat, i fixed one problem, now all tests are passing, but sizzle tests are now start to execute after couple of minutes and falling at it
[08:06:43] <m_gol> markelog: any details? http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2333 shows failures in the event module
[08:10:13] <markelog> probably not connected
[08:10:43] <markelog> my commit only fixed one issue didn't broke anything that was already broken
[08:12:38] <m_gol> markelog: but I don't see any Sizzle tests problems
[08:12:54] <m_gol> and the current failures seem Sinon-related, that's why I asked
[08:14:10] <m_gol> it's weird on 1.x even non-old IE are failing
[08:14:13] <markelog> you don't see them but they are there
[08:14:35] <markelog> run effects module tests then wait for 20 seconds
[08:14:54] <m_gol> ah, ok, so it's about slowness, not failing
[08:15:07] <markelog> well no
[08:15:22] <markelog> you will understand if try it
[08:18:09] <rwaldron> markelog the spec shown on the repo promises-unwrapping is the spec that has consensus
[08:18:30] <rwaldron> Domenic and Allan are working together to merge the change deltas into the draft
[08:18:36] <rwaldron> Allen*
[08:19:08] <markelog> so no objections from anyone?
[08:20:55] <rwaldron> consensus doesn't mean no objections
[08:21:12] <rwaldron> it means that no one objects enough to prevent moving forward
[08:21:28] <rwaldron> or, in this case
[08:21:34] <rwaldron> "We all agree to implement"
[08:21:41] <rwaldron> which is probably more accurate
[08:22:17] <markelog> so it's 100% it will be in the next draft
[08:22:20] <markelog> ?
[08:25:17] <rwaldron> markelog well, I can't say that without asking Allen
[08:25:45] <rwaldron> I _can_ say that it will 100% be in ECMA-262 6th Edition
[08:26:03] <rwaldron> Allen will likely publish a new draft in the next two weeks
[08:26:17] <rwaldron> (in preparation for the next meeting)
[08:26:23] <rwaldron> it could be there
[08:26:33] <rwaldron> but he has so much work to do
[08:37:20] <terrycojones> rwaldron & markelog: are you guys talking about some version of Promises/A+ coming to jQuery, or moving to built-in JS promises? Domenic = Domenic Denicola?
[08:49:07] <markelog> terrycojones: no
[08:49:25] <terrycojones> markelog: thx.  sorry to butt in!
[08:49:34] <markelog> no problem
[08:57:46] <markelog> m_gol: just found the problem with sinon
[08:59:39] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery01] 15markelog pushed 1 new commit to 061.x-master: 02http://git.io/96k5bQ
[08:59:39] <jqcommit> 13jquery/061.x-master 143fbbe93 15Oleg: Tests: Fix another issue with sinon timers
[09:04:38] <markelog> Krinkle|detached: it seems commits to 1.x-master do not trigger testswarm?
[09:14:00] <jzaefferer> markelog: probably the jenkins build is failing before it gets to submitting to TestSwarm: http://jenkins.jquery.com/
[09:14:42] <jzaefferer> looks like the git-build-upload-to-CDN failed: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201.x/347/console
[09:15:46] <markelog> jzaefferer: how about closing this issue and open the new one with correct explanation?
[09:16:53] <jzaefferer> I started another job to see if this was just a one-time hickup
[09:17:16] <markelog> it happend before, with https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/f1af3c23f9fbef69b69868773fd01b4950ae2f9f
[09:17:45] <markelog> but with https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/06ee2c16f1c466a77fb25e07991e5adaa3385656
[09:17:52] <markelog> it worked
[09:19:24] <jzaefferer> you can look through previous jenkins jobs
[09:19:46] <jzaefferer> the new one failed as well, need help from gnarf or s5fs
[09:20:01] <markelog> yeah, i saw your comment
[09:20:31] <gnarf> jzaefferer: markelog: jq01 has been getting loaded down a bit
[09:20:34] <gnarf> ssh is failing
[09:20:38] <gnarf> intermittent
[09:20:43] <gnarf> i wonder if scp has a retries option
[09:21:07] <jzaefferer> well, anything you can do about the load on jq01?
[09:21:13] <gnarf> working on it
[09:21:31] <gnarf> it might be nice to let that command fail tho
[09:21:47] <gnarf> so the build still builds
[09:22:17] <jzaefferer> well, I could make that happen, but having a succesful build that doesn't update the git build isn't great either
[09:22:24] <jzaefferer> that would be even harder to track down
[09:23:44] <gnarf> jzaefferer: agree, but impact on CI workflow is less
[09:23:56] <gnarf> jzaefferer: perhaps defer the error to the end
[09:24:19] <gnarf> scp blah jq01:blah || SSH_ERROR=$?
[09:24:29] <jzaefferer> that would get tricky. The shell scripts in the jenkins job are complicated enough for my taste already
[09:36:34] <Krinkle> markelog: jzaefferer: Indeed, the shell script is aborted early before it gets to testswarm because it can't connect to jq01 (ssh timed out)
[09:37:01] <Krinkle> npm install, npm test/grunt, cdn push, grunt testswarm
[09:40:24] <markelog> DaveMethvin: does it make sence change resolution of http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11166 to "patchwelcome"?
[09:40:42] <markelog> just like with other svg related tickets?
[09:51:18] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15jzaefferer closed pull request #498: Core: Run multiple tests by test number (06master...06multiple-tests) 02http://git.io/zIjdGw
[09:52:04] <DaveMethvin> markelog: perhaps we could mark it as a dup? it's a subset of the problem
[09:52:16] <DaveMethvin> really i don't think we'll ever do any SVG manipulation
[09:52:33] <DaveMethvin> mainly we've been concerned about dealing with events that bubble out of SVG
[09:52:50] <DaveMethvin> so patchwelcome is should probably be wontfix
[09:53:02] <markelog> me too, but http://contribute.jquery.org/wont-fix/ states that "We simply don't have the time"
[09:53:18] <markelog> we should probably change that then?
[09:53:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's been worded that way for 5 years :)
[09:53:39] <DaveMethvin> agreed, we should be clearer about what SVG bugs are in scope
[09:54:31] <markelog> and we could change "patchwelcome" to "wontfix" res on the tickets mentioned on that page
[09:55:40] <markelog> i will submit PR for contribute.jquery.org after it will be accepted i could change the ticket resolutions
