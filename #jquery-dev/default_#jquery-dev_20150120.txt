[02:21:48] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15jzaefferer opened pull request #734: Fix html reporter toolbar bug (06master...06fix-html-reporter-toolbar-bug) 02http://git.io/UYt6Xg
[05:56:43] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin|away: Why is this trac-/# ref a problem for core anyway?
[05:56:53] <scott_gonzalez> Why are there references to trac at all at this point?
[05:57:13] <scott_gonzalez> I thought the whole plan was to move all issues to GitHub and then only use GitHub going forward.
[06:00:49] <gibson042> sure, until something better comes along
[06:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what that means.
[06:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> Are you expecting a better Trac that you'll switch to in the future?
[06:03:48] <gibson042> I also remember the current plan being to use GitHub exclusively going forward, but that could change at any time
[06:04:05] <gibson042> prefixing avoids future collisions
[06:04:07] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, but my question is why is there a sudden need to reference Trac specifically?
[06:04:25] <gibson042> we've got collisions right now between GH and Trac
[06:04:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not questioning the use of gh-, that was supposed to be happening already.
[06:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> Why are there any Trac references at all today?
[06:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> That's my question.
[06:04:56] <gibson042> they're already in the codebase
[06:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> Why do we need documentation abouat usin trac- going forward?
[06:05:03] <gibson042> as "#xxx"
[06:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> So this is for code comments not commit messages?
[06:05:42] <gibson042> right; I can't imagine a new commit message referencing Trac at this point
[06:06:07] <arschmitz> oh thats totally different i thought this was about commit messages 
[06:06:14] <gibson042> hmm, no that may not be right
[06:06:21] <gibson042> it could be present as a Ref
[06:06:37] <gibson042> e.g., removing an old fix
[06:06:44] <arschmitz> if so why would # be a problem though ? if it was # it can only be trac ?
[06:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it'd be so rare that we wouldn't need to document that in the commit guidelines on contribute.
[06:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Because GitHub will link it.
[06:07:11] <arschmitz> ohhhhh right
[06:07:16] <arschmitz> ok
[06:07:26] <gibson042> yeah, I think I agree that it's too specific for contribute.
[06:07:42] <arschmitz> but yeah still seems like it would be really rare
[06:07:44] <gibson042> the trackers are per-project, so the tracker references should be as well
[06:09:18] <arschmitz> gibson042: except then cross project reference's get weird 
[06:09:31] <gibson042> they already are
[06:09:51] <arschmitz> gibson042: not really that was the point of the guidelines on contribute
[06:10:45] <arschmitz> gibson042: an exception like this seems fine and seems like it should be per project but the guidelines in general for references in general i don't think should be 
[06:11:09] <arschmitz> ah to early in the morning for typing 
[06:12:19] <gibson042> I agree
[06:13:03] <gibson042> and note that [user]/[repo]#xxx is GitHub-specific anyway
[06:14:11] <arschmitz> yes
[06:14:36] <arschmitz> and its the one place if i recall you have to use # not gh- on github
[06:14:45] <arschmitz> but since its a github specific format it does not matter
[06:33:59] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15leobalter opened pull request #735: [WIP]: ES6 Modules (06master...06707-es6-modules) 02http://git.io/8jklDQ
[07:14:14] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: GitHub will link UI issues as well if numbers match so maybe it'd be safer to not use # at all after all
[07:36:59] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Not using # means no auto-linking for us.
[07:37:14] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you know how to make Trac use a custom prefix.
[07:37:41] <scott_gonzalez> I think we might be able to make it work with InterTrac, but I can't access the server.

[12:30:47] <scott_gonzalez> leobalter: That deploy failed because of the two tags.
[12:31:19] <leobalter> it was my first release
[12:31:39] <leobalter> jquery-release broke sometimes, the last one because I missed the access to the CDN
[12:31:49] <leobalter> and most came manually
[12:32:35] <leobalter> jzaefferer is giving me all the support, I'm sorry for the broke stuff. 
[12:33:24] <scott_gonzalez> No problem. Just wanted to let you know. I'm assuming you don't get the deployment emails.
[12:35:24] <leobalter> I don't
[12:35:30] <leobalter> just the travis-ci
[12:35:43] <leobalter> I pushed a wrong 1.17.2 and than deleted it
