[05:57:57] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: When I read "I think this is a very serious bug. Must be released hotfix." I instantly thought about people using jquery-latest and us being able to deploy hotfixes to random production sites :-P
[06:09:28] <ajpiano> when i read that i think, "i made the same point two days ago" :/
[06:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, as you predicted there have been several duplicates already.
[06:11:07] <ajpiano> a known feature is 100% broken, so it's not surprising

[07:31:50] <DaveMethvin> `read
[07:31:51] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: From gibson042, 16h 53m ago: something's up with Jenkins; current builds are "pendingâ€”Waiting for next available executor" and jquery-git* are out of date
[07:32:19] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle dyk what is happening there?
[07:33:30] <scott_gonzalez> I think we're in the middle of moving to a new server.
[07:35:40] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: That's what jzaefferer said
[07:36:01] <Krinkle> I am aware of the move, but not currently involved with the server move. I don't know the most recent details.
[07:36:26] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/176
[07:36:31] <Krinkle> It looks like jzaefferer has already started.
[08:16:50] <matijsb> hey all, anyone here who can explain why there is a difference in the arguments for the handlers for .ajaxSuccess() en jqXHR.done() is this just legacy?
[08:22:02] <scott_gonzalez> Well, for starters one is an event and one is a promise.
[08:44:38] <matijsb> scott_gonzalez: but why is there a difference in the arguments?
[08:47:00] <scott_gonzalez> They're just different things.
[08:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> They don't serve the same purpose.
[08:52:05] <matijsb> okay, thanks
[10:54:11] <ajpiano> ok DaveMethvin !
