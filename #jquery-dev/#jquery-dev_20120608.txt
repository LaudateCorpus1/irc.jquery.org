[08:07:22] <jzaefferer> though a commit message update is really only helpful as a ammend commit
[08:07:28] <jzaefferer> next time; I can take care of that now

[09:28:10] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: yeah, I meant to close. Keeping #246 open for the remaining part
[09:28:33] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I just found another ghost run with runs = 4294967294
[09:28:44] <Krinkle> I know the cause but I don't know the causes cause
[09:28:56] <Krinkle> the cause is it is an int row, and -1 is 4294967294
[09:29:14] <Krinkle> but it shouldn't ever be lowered, only raised
[09:29:51] <Krinkle> grr, I should have taken a closer look at the queries during the rewrite
[09:30:07] <Krinkle> I mostly decided to not touch the mysql part of testswarm, so that everything says as it is in terms of logic
[09:30:20] <Krinkle> looks like there is a few bugs there as well. I'll get on that over the weekend.
[09:30:31] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:30:33] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: also, I've got a few ideas to fix the timeout issues.
[09:31:17] <Krinkle> right now we have a bit of a hacky re-use of time loops. e.g. a client sign on, gets a run, and if after X minutes no results, the cleanup-api-cron resets it.
[09:31:30] <Krinkle> and the whoisonline stats (as well as other things derived from it), use that same thing
[09:31:50] <Krinkle> I plan to fix that by making the run client ping to home, even when there are no results yet
[09:32:17] <Krinkle> so that we can have a maximum-run-time that is independent from how long we wait until we consider the client to be dead
[09:32:37] <Krinkle> we can set the latter to 1 minute and have the maximum-run-time stay at 5
[09:32:46] <Krinkle> every minute a quick ajax ping to home
[09:33:11] <Krinkle> then we don't loose time thinking/hoping the client is still there but just busy running
[09:35:36] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: what do you think?
[09:37:49] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: sounds good
[09:37:56] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: also, I've taken another look at ua-parser and I think it has now grown into a state where we can use it.
[09:37:56] <Krinkle>  The main part I like about it is that we don't have 2 says of limiting pairs (right now browscap.ini has its own set of rules which need updating after each version, and then we have our own sub set). ua-parser is not version-specific. It uses the same patterns as browscap but without hardcode repeating everything for each version. So this will be a big improvement.
[09:38:29] <jzaefferer> Sounds even better :-)

[09:51:26] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #187 on testswarm (Krinkle;  ago): Use ua-parser instead of browscap
[09:56:44] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: the last browser in the example is messed up
[09:56:48] <jzaefferer> mix of Safari and Chrome
[09:57:27] <Krinkle> fixed
[09:58:08] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: http://uaparser.dmolsen.com/
[10:01:01] <jzaefferer> Let's see if that properly detects Chrome for Android
[10:01:04] <jzaefferer> browserscope doesn't
[10:01:37] <jzaefferer> it does, nice :-)
[10:01:49] <Krinkle> and it doesn't argue about Mobile Safari being Safari
[10:02:05] <jzaefferer> should tell Souders to use that
[10:02:19] <Krinkle> I think he does
[10:02:34] <Krinkle> this is the successor of his, now obsolete, project.
[10:02:40] <jzaefferer> I don't, as Chrome for Android gets detected as Chrome 18
[10:02:53] <jzaefferer> whatever
[10:03:38] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: http://stevesouders.com/ua/
[10:03:42] <Krinkle> browserscope uses ua-parser
[10:03:44] <Krinkle> you told me that
[10:03:54] <jzaefferer> mhm
[10:04:07] <Krinkle> Or did you mean to say browscap  ?
[10:04:19] <jzaefferer> no
[10:04:21] <Krinkle> ok
[10:04:28] <jzaefferer> nice, there are five links to browserscope on that page
[10:04:31] <jzaefferer> PLEASE GO HERE
[10:04:41] <jzaefferer> speaking of go, I gotta go

[12:31:25] <sabotage> danheberden: (repeat of Q just asked on #jquery)... any chance the presentation you gave yesterday @Instrument is online?  I missed the first 10-15min and the info about grunt
