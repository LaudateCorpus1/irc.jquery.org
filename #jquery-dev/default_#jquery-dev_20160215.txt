[12:49:19] <m_gol> markelog: do you plan to touch a lot of test files soon?
[12:49:28] <m_gol> (or know about anyone that plans to do so?)
[12:51:34] <markelog> no, but Richard had a pr for the sizzle tests
[12:51:42] <markelog> why you ask?
[12:51:45] <m_gol> I mean for jQuery Core
[12:52:03] <markelog> yeah, mentioned just in case
[12:52:11] <m_gol> because I'd like to get 2868
[12:52:29] <m_gol> which may touch a lot of files depending on how much legacy stuff do we have there
[12:52:41] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2868
[12:53:29] <markelog> okay, i will do the modularization one after your pr
[12:53:47] <markelog> also, i see you close https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2895
[12:54:04] <markelog> it should be replaced by general ticket
[12:55:59] <m_gol> markelog: what general ticket?

[17:07:15] <Krinkle> Hm.. there doesn't appear to be a Promise in the public API for when an animation ends.
[17:07:22] <Krinkle> 'complete' from animate() is called per-element
[17:07:42] <Krinkle> and promise() keeps being post-poned when new animations are added
[17:08:06] <Krinkle> the only public interface I found that works is to call queue() after animation() and resolve a promise within that callback
