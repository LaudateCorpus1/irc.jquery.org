[06:18:15] <gibson042> DaveMethvin: regarding https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/622, is there a way to update this branch to fix against @mikesherov's changes while still maintaining a clean/readable/sane history, or should I just abandon it and start a new one?
[06:18:16] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by gibson042 (1m, 5d ago): Fix #10931: Allow unit tests to work without web access.
[06:18:47] <DaveMethvin> I'd probably start a new one
[06:32:09] <danheberden> gnarf do you have a sec to look at the bugs.jquery.com box today?
[06:54:54] <gnarf> danheberden: last i remember looking at it, it was something trac related and i scratched my head, but sure :)
[06:55:38] <danheberden> it is :/
[06:55:51] <danheberden> the server itself is running great
[08:32:48] <gnarf> danheberden: i really have no clue
[08:33:05] <gnarf> danheberden: there is like nothing on that box :)
[08:33:49] <gnarf> seems that trac is eating all the cpu it can most of the time
[08:34:19] <danheberden> it's like "mysql? buddy? I WILL LOVE YOU FOREVER AND EVER AND HUG YOU AND HOLD YOU AND NEVER LET YOU GO"
[08:40:23] <gnarf> danheberden: can you force a backup image of that machine?
[08:40:44] <gnarf>  really wanna try http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracNginxRecipe -- using tracd behind nginx instead of fastcgi
[08:41:02] <gnarf> the trac performance thing says that running it as a CGI is like the worst thing you can do for perf
[08:41:27] <danheberden> gnarf but that wouldn't really affect the thread locking on mysql, would it?
[08:41:46] <gnarf> i can't look on mysql
[08:41:50] <gnarf> but it might
[08:41:59] <gnarf> considering if tracd is using a single connection
[08:42:03] <gnarf> it might be smarter about locking
[08:44:06] <gnarf> with the CGI version it might be spawning up a new "lock" for each connection
[08:46:55] <danheberden> interesting
[09:06:39] <gnarf> trying this
[09:10:16] <gnarf> throw some shit at bugs.jquery.com
[09:11:20] <gnarf> danheberden: DaveMethvin timmywil - hell anyone whos awake
[09:11:24] <gnarf> STRESS TEST TRAC PLEASE
[09:11:38] <gnarf> ajpiano:
[09:11:42] <DaveMethvin> your wish is my command gnarf danheberden
[09:12:00] <DaveMethvin> already seems to be feeling better
[09:12:01] <danheberden> goin goin
[09:12:04] <DaveMethvin> HIT IT HARDER
[09:12:47] <gnarf> this seems WAY MORE responsive than the fastcgi config
[09:14:37] <DaveMethvin> yep, agreed
[09:14:51] <DaveMethvin> if it's not fast, why do they call it fastcgi?
[09:15:00] <gnarf> its still cgi
[09:15:03] <gnarf> its faster than cgi
[09:15:23] <gnarf> so this seems like the setup we want to use
[09:15:29] <gnarf> lemme convert bugs.jqueryui.com over too
[09:15:36] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[09:15:37] <gnarf> and we can run on it for a day or two for testing
[09:15:47] <danheberden> gnarf this definitely is helping
[09:15:53] <danheberden> i think you were/are def onthe right trac
[09:15:56] <DaveMethvin> thanks guys!
[09:16:24] <danheberden> gnarf i'm convinced anything on apache is a huge pile of shit that should be burned and throwon away
[09:16:38] <gnarf> it ws using nginx already
[09:16:44] <danheberden> wat
[09:16:58] <danheberden> what did you change?
[09:17:08] <gnarf> i switched to using tracd instead of trac.fastcgi
[09:17:35] <danheberden> wow
[09:18:11] <gnarf> anyone remember the command for making an init.d script get added to the correct rc.d folders?
[09:18:53] <danheberden> `update-rc.d command` ?
[09:23:34] <gnarf> yup
[09:24:35] <gnarf> okay, bugs.jqueryui.com is now running that too
[09:25:59] <gnarf> we'll see if MySQL ever goes away
[09:26:08] <gnarf> but this is like 10* speedier in my eyes
[09:26:16] <danzik17> gnarf: it's actually not....painful....to run the reports now.  awesome.
[09:26:47] <gnarf> yay google
[09:27:03] <gnarf> ?g trac performance
[09:27:04] <bot-t1> gnarf, TracPerformance – The Trac Project - http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/TracPerformance
[09:27:09] <gnarf> thats where this all started ;)
[09:27:33] <gnarf> "The most obvious wrong thing to do here is installing Trac as a CGI script. Even for testing, there are better alternatives (tracd)."
[09:30:43] <danheberden> i'm surprised it got installed that way
[09:33:29] <gnarf> so just to make sure
[09:33:40] <gnarf> i'd like to reboot that server to make sure everything starts up kosher
[09:33:44] <gnarf> danheberden: agreed?
[09:33:58] <danheberden> gnarf, make sure ssh is in rc.d
[09:34:04] <danheberden> last time, it didn't reboot
[09:34:07] <danheberden> *start
[09:34:23] <danheberden> and i had to have (mt) start it
[09:34:27] <danheberden> which took like 3 days
[09:34:50] <gnarf> done
[09:34:52] <gnarf> and it wasnt
[09:34:53] <gnarf> :)
[09:35:14] <gnarf> rebootin
[09:35:56] <danheberden> yay for foresight!
[09:36:55] <gnarf> im not sure wtf is "sleep 60" in the init script
[09:37:01] <gnarf> but something is stalling for no good reason
[09:37:21] <danheberden> their boxes take a bit to get toing
[09:37:22] <danheberden> *going
[09:46:33] <gnarf> danheberden: im not sure why that didn't start on startup
[09:46:39] <gnarf> its totally in the rc.d
[09:46:44] <gnarf> but *shrug*
[09:46:59] <gnarf>  /etc/init.d/trac-bugs.jquery.com start
[09:47:03] <gnarf>  /etc/init.d/trac-bugs.jqueryui.com start
[09:47:05] <gnarf> worked
[09:49:47] <gnarf> danheberden: if you peek in those init scripts, you'll see 3 instances of each, and then in the "upstream" & "proxy_pass" of the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled files

[09:57:51] <danheberden> gnarf and it's still not starting on boot?
[09:58:02] <gnarf> danheberden: *shrug* not sure why
[09:58:20] <gnarf> danheberden: also, i put the old nginx configs in /etc/nginx/sites-backup
[09:58:31] <gnarf> in case we need to roll back for some ungodly reason
[09:58:33] <danheberden> gnarf thanks :)
[09:59:00] <gnarf> so like, we finally have snow... see ?weather
[09:59:02] <bot-t> gnarf, Rockford, IL - Weather: Light snow, -6°C / 22°F
[09:59:14] <gnarf> getting like 5" tonight i hear
[09:59:25] <danheberden> we've had an awful winter for it
[09:59:47] <gnarf> i kinda wanna call up my friend and see if there is a snowboarding excursion planned
[10:01:26] <kborchers> gnarf: where u guys go? alpine? devil's head? elsewhere?
[10:01:35] <gnarf> either/both
[10:01:36] <gnarf> ;)
[10:01:39] <gnarf> usually alpine
[10:01:54] <gnarf> I'm horrible
[10:01:58] <kborchers> me too :)
[10:02:00] <gnarf> i can still barely stand on the damn thing
[10:02:08] <gnarf> but i'm determined to get good at it
[10:02:16] <kborchers> i've still only done skiis
[10:02:24] <kborchers> want to snowboard this year hopefully
[10:02:28] <gnarf> i like the board more
[10:02:31] <gnarf> than ski
[10:02:37] <kborchers> i think i would too
[11:48:19] <tbranyen> hey mr jrburke can i bug ya in pm?
[11:48:29] <jrburke> sure tbranyen
[13:40:04] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: great article on HTML5 video!  Is it possible the embedded YouTube issues were due to the video acceleration being on?
[13:40:36] <kswedberg> Hey DaveMethvin, thanks!
[13:42:06] <kswedberg> I don't think so about the hardware acceleration, because just removing the ?wmode=transparent made the video show up.
[13:42:26] <kswedberg> ( thx fo the retweet, too. :-) )
[13:42:31] <DaveMethvin> sure
[13:42:34] <DaveMethvin> really good info
[13:45:25] <kswedberg> there's one other thing I forgot to mention in the article â€¦ the H5BP .htaccess uses a newer Filterâ€¦ COMPRESS directive that breaks video for me in Chrome
[13:45:31] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: ^^
[13:45:52] <DaveMethvin> oh good info
[13:46:05] <kswedberg> so I just use the DEFLATE for "Legacy versions of Apache"
[13:51:12] <DaveMethvin> oh kswedberg, if you have IE9 and set it to IE8 mode, then close developer tools, it should stay in IE8 mode ... at least it seemed to do it for me
[13:51:31] <kswedberg> oh, awesome. did not know that!
[13:51:41] <DaveMethvin> that has bitten me before
[13:51:49] <DaveMethvin> i thought it would go away when i closed tools
[13:52:00] <kswedberg> heh. but in this case it's a feature!
[13:52:06] <DaveMethvin> good old ie
[13:53:28] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: so does it even stay in compat mode after a page refresh?
[13:53:40] <DaveMethvin> seemed to for me
[13:53:44] <kswedberg> wow
[13:53:51] <DaveMethvin> didn't go away until i exited and opened it again
[13:55:03] <DaveMethvin> i have a test page: http://methvin.com/detect/compat.php
[13:55:19] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: you can go there ^ and try it
[13:55:31] <kswedberg> cool. thx, DaveMethvin!
[13:55:38] <DaveMethvin> even after you reload it says documentMode=8
[13:57:10] <kswedberg> these are the kinds of things that are never built into estimates. :/ and clients seldom acknowledge the shit ton of work that goes into troubleshooting all this stuff.
[13:58:15] <DaveMethvin> well now you are an expert so you can charge double! :P
[13:58:20] <kswedberg> hehe
[15:49:06] <eddiemonge> danheberden: you there?
[15:50:23] <eddiemonge> how can i troubleshoot: Starting httpd: (98)Address already in use: make_sock: could not bind to address 0.0.0.0:80

[15:52:12] <eddiemonge> nevermind, got it
[15:59:36] <mikesherov_> that's better
[16:00:03] <eddiemonge> yeah it is
[16:05:59] <mikesherov> that's actually better

[18:28:54] <scott_gonzalez> Am I going crazy or is event.which not part of the DOM Events standard for MouseEvent? Is this really just some crazy legacy proprietary thing that has stuck around forever?
[18:54:28] <gnarf> which is a jQuery thing i thought
[18:55:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: #whatwg ? :)
[18:55:38] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, really? It's specific to jQuery?
[18:55:45] <scott_gonzalez> That makes sense.
[18:56:19] <scott_gonzalez> We just decided to hijack a KeyEvent prop? :-P
[18:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> MS is using which for pointer events :-)
[19:01:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's not us, it's native
[19:01:54] <scott_gonzalez> document.body.addEventListener( "mousedown", function( event ) { console.log( event.which ); }, false );
