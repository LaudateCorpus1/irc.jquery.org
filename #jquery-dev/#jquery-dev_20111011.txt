[04:45:53] <jayflux> hy guys, found a weird problem with chrome when it comes to setting a td's height with jQuery. May be a bug but thought i should post my problem here first to see what other people's opinion of it are
[04:46:50] <jayflux> http://goo.gl/IYmvO is the page, the td on the left should fill the height of its parent, it does this properly on FF and other browsers but chrome it only goes half way down
[04:46:58] <jayflux> http://jsfiddle.net/Sn9Fq/ is the script
[04:47:15] <jayflux> im using 1.6.4
[05:35:18] <DaveMethvin> .
[05:45:54] <jzaefferer> would like to get a commit bot for QUnit in here, who can do that?
[05:46:05] <jzaefferer> I can add commit hooks in the repo
[06:49:42] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i'm seeing a lot of UI unit test fails for ie9 even with 1.6.2, is that normal?
[06:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...we should only have a few (<10 across all suites)
[06:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> let me check
[06:52:06] <DaveMethvin> http://gyazo.com/c57b374eca93c27fbfd36f57d2a08312 scott_gonzalez
[06:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> 35 on dialog is definitely not normal
[06:53:35] <scott_gonzalez> I think I fixed slider, tabs and tooltip yesterday
[06:55:12] <DaveMethvin> well the good news is that I will be testing these more frequently now, i had it on my list to do and kept forgetting
[06:57:29] <scott_gonzalez> I've been working on getting everything green
[06:57:36] <scott_gonzalez> which will obviously make it much more useful
[06:57:57] <DaveMethvin> as long as I can tell what I screwed up, that's my goal :)
[06:58:09] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I'm only getting 2 failures against master: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/10/
[06:58:38] <DaveMethvin> damn i hate browsers
[06:58:59] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[06:59:24] <DaveMethvin> When I test here I have one that is new in Chrome/FF, it's failing the autoFocus test in autocomplete but I cannot figure it out
[07:00:27] <DaveMethvin> so that swarm result is using jquery-git??
[07:02:07] <scott_gonzalez> no, the swarm is using 1.6.2
[07:02:46] <DaveMethvin> ok, well it still doesn't match my ie9 then ...
[07:02:51] <DaveMethvin> and i still hate browsers
[07:03:08] <DaveMethvin> lemme see if maybe some plugins crept into there and are hosing it
[07:04:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'll run the full test suite locally too and see if it's any different for some reason
[07:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> I get a bunch of failures running all.html
[07:05:33] <DaveMethvin> welcome to the "I hate browsers" club scott_gonzalez, here's your badge
[07:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...let me see what's going on
[07:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...compatibility view makes most of the dialog tests pass
[07:08:43] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if the swarm is running in IE8 compat view ... that would be bad
[07:09:18] <scott_gonzalez> indeed it would be bad
[07:19:19] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: heisenberg would be proud of ie9, i am getting different fails when i refresh, empty cache, etc
[07:20:02] <DaveMethvin> on the second run i get a datepicker fail on the empty collection test, but when i examine the dom the element is not there
[07:21:05] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, that datepicker test is crap
[07:23:43] <DaveMethvin> .seen jq-jenkins
[07:23:44] <hsbot> jq-jenkins was seen 3 hours, 48 minutes and 32 seconds ago, in #jquery-dev, saying: * joern.zaefferer: Extend readme regarding release process
[07:26:14] <jzaefferer> how many bots do we have here by now?
[07:27:05] <jzaefferer> speaking of bots, who can I pester about the commitbot for QUnit?
[07:27:11] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin, any idea?
[07:29:13] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure who set up the other bots
[07:29:15] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer:
[07:31:52] <jzaefferer> okay
[07:32:25] <jzaefferer> ?tell gnarf any idea who's to ping about the bots? how can we get a commit bot for QUnit into #jquery-dev?
[07:32:26] <bot-t> jzaefferer, Okay.
[07:53:22] <gnarf> jzaefferer: the commit bots are a post commit hook on the repo
[07:53:22] <bot-t> (20 mins 50 secs ago) <jzaefferer> tell gnarf any idea who's to ping about the bots? how can we get a commit bot for QUnit into #jquery-dev?
[07:53:26] <gnarf> i believe they are built in
[07:53:31] <gnarf> to github
[07:55:39] <jzaefferer> mhm
[07:55:54] <jzaefferer> I saw a postbin something on jquery
[07:55:57] <jzaefferer> but nothing on UI
[07:55:59] <jzaefferer> gonna check again
[07:57:01] <jzaefferer> ah, yeah, its a separate hook, gonna add that for qunit

[12:04:46] <rwaldron> that PR would love a review from yo
[12:04:49] <rwaldron> ou*
[12:04:51] <rwaldron> !!!1
[12:04:52] <rwaldron> you*
[12:05:57] <gnarf> eww
[12:06:07] <kborchers> can someone change this example http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[12:06:14] <kborchers> $("*").live(... really?
[12:06:42] <gnarf> woah
[12:06:46] <rwaldron> kswedberg ^^^^^
[12:06:56] <gnarf> kborchers: rewrite a new example
[12:06:59] <gnarf> i'll put it in for ya
[12:06:59] <gnarf> ;)
[12:07:02] <rwaldron> kborchers do you have a suggestion?
[12:07:05] <rwaldron> yeah what he said
[12:07:09] <rwaldron> i was going to suggest the same
[12:07:20] <kborchers> i'll write one up and send it to gnarf
[12:07:22] <rwaldron> gnarf is probably better at that then I am
[12:07:32] <rwaldron> I've only done docs a few times
[12:07:43] <kswedberg> I can help too if needed
[12:08:20] <kswedberg> fwiw I don't think .live() is the devil.
[12:08:45] <gnarf> kswedberg: $("*").live() might be the devil
[12:08:52] <gnarf> particularly the $("*")
[12:09:07] <gnarf> or even $( window ).delegate( "*"
[12:09:10] <kswedberg> not if there are only 6 elements in the DOM ;)
[12:09:11] <gnarf> would be way better
[12:09:12] <kborchers> kswedberg: in this case it may be ok ... but when a noob sees that and starts doing all of their bindings that way ...
[12:09:20] <kswedberg> yeah.
[12:09:32] <kborchers> like the guy i was just helping in #jquery that led me to that
[12:09:38] <kswedberg> heh
[12:11:37] <gnarf> rwaldron: docs#9217

[12:11:44] <gnarf> so like what timmywil said?
[12:11:49] <rwaldron> i dunno
[12:11:55] <rwaldron> i didnt look
[12:12:04] <rwaldron> i just saw that it changed effects stuff
[12:12:07] <gnarf> "you should stop animations before removing"
[12:12:08] <rwaldron> and sent it your way
[12:14:50] <gnarf> timmywil: you here?
[12:15:26] <timmywil> wat

[12:15:45] <bot-t> [#9217] jQuery crashes in IE8 when scrollTop-animated element is removed (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9217
[12:16:16] <gnarf> is there a reason we don't .stop something we .remove()
[12:17:01] <timmywil> we could clear the queue before removal
[12:17:13] <gnarf> well removal = queue clearing anyway
[12:17:17] <gnarf> because it removes data
[12:17:27] <timmywil> it doesn't remove timers
[12:17:28] <gnarf> but it doesn't solve a .detach()
[12:17:30] <gnarf> exactly
[12:17:39] <gnarf> timers are still there - perhaps we should stop em
[12:18:14] <gnarf> added some comments on the pull / adding to the bug
[12:18:27] <timmywil> as a user, I would .stop myself before removal, but we could do that
[12:18:42] <gnarf> if we are going to fix it
[12:18:44] <gnarf> we should do that
[12:18:55] <gnarf> if not, we should tell people to .stop().remove() if the element might be animated
[12:19:04] <gnarf> but .stop() isn't recursive like the cleanData is
[12:19:11] <gnarf> so it might be easier for us to fix
[12:19:42] <timmywil> agreed
[12:20:27] <timmywil> eek, that pull just sticks in a try/catch
[12:20:38] <timmywil> -_-
[12:20:52] <gnarf> close it
[12:22:18] <gnarf> i could pick this one up
[12:22:25] <gnarf> the bug that is
[12:22:28] <gnarf> unless you want it
[12:22:39] <timmywil> go for it
[12:22:41] <timmywil> pull closed
[12:22:50] <gnarf> 1.8?
[12:23:00] <gnarf> i might be able to sneak it into 1.7
[12:23:01] <timmywil> bug fix, we could fit this into 1.7 if we want
[12:25:01] <gnarf> ooo shit
[12:25:16] <gnarf> cleanData has a chance of getting called from a .tick
[12:25:36] <rwaldron> gnarf good stuff
[12:25:42] <rwaldron> (jsut read your comments)
[12:26:24] <rwaldron> i get really annoyed by patches that are no more then try/catch thrown around something that some browser chokes on
[12:26:31] <rwaldron> worst fix ever
[12:31:24] <gnarf> so um
[12:31:30] <gnarf> do we have a $.returnFalse ? :)
[12:31:36] <gnarf> i know $.noop
[12:34:42] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: if $.noop returned false it would be doing *something*
[12:34:44] <gnarf> kborchers / kswedberg: http://api.jquery.com/focus-selector/
[12:34:51] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: this i also know
[12:34:53] <DaveMethvin> can't have that
[12:34:57] <gnarf> i just had a use for a "return false"
[12:35:05] <gnarf> so i made a function returnFalse() { return false; }
[12:35:06] <DaveMethvin> there's a return true/false function inside event but it's not exposed
[12:35:16] <DaveMethvin> lol WE"RE NOT DRY!
[12:35:24] <gnarf> cuz i want to detach it from the scope of the calling function
[12:36:04] <kswedberg> gnarf: I see $("#content").delegate() but I don't see an element with id="content"?
[12:36:10] <rwaldron> gnarf that exists in events
[12:36:13] <rwaldron> but no globally
[12:36:15] <rwaldron> not*
[12:36:20] <gnarf> kswedberg: oops
[12:37:13] <gnarf> kswedberg: updated
[12:37:16] <kborchers> gnarf: y u bastardize my example ;)
[12:37:34] <kswedberg> ah. much better. :)
[12:37:44] <gnarf> can we switch to #bada55
[12:37:48] <gnarf> instead of #abcdef ?
[12:37:51] <gnarf> i feel bad
[12:37:57] <gnarf> cuz i think i mighta written this example :/
[12:38:27] <gnarf> prolly not tho
[12:38:33] <gnarf> don't think I would of done tabIndex
[12:39:44] <kswedberg> gnarf: looks like it was you. http://api.jquery.com/wp-admin/revision.php?revision=4280&action=edit
[12:39:58] * gnarf frowns
[12:40:30] <kswedberg> no biggie.
[12:40:34] <gnarf> the things we learn in 5 months
[12:40:36] <gnarf> ;)
[12:40:45] <kswedberg> :)
[12:41:10] <gnarf> should our examples follow our style guides?
[12:42:26] <gnarf> kborchers: if you have a better idea for a demo of ":focus" then let me know
[12:42:38] <kswedberg> gnarf: yes.
[12:43:19] <kborchers> gnarf: i don't at the moment. i think that does a good job of showing how it works ... i was just bothered by the $("*").live bit
[12:43:27] <kswedberg> gnarf: http://oksoclap.com/jquery-api-style-guide
[12:44:19] <gnarf> kswedberg: bookmarked
[12:44:48] <kswedberg> cool. I'll send out an email to api team one of these days with a link, too.
[12:45:11] <gnarf> i think im on that list now
[12:45:22] <kswedberg> yes, you are, sir!
[12:47:15] <gnarf> hrm
[12:47:23] <gnarf> anyone familiar with the manipulation unit tests?
[12:47:34] <gnarf> i'm trying to figure out how to add a check for removing from $.timers
[12:52:45] <gnarf> we need a "ways" type for $.Callbacks
[12:52:52] <gnarf> $.Callbacks("unique ways")
[12:53:15] <gnarf> oh and hey
[12:53:25] <gnarf> anyone look at my pull yet about stop( queue )? ?

[13:05:20] <gnarf> um
[13:05:21] <gnarf> DaveMethvin:
[13:05:30] <gnarf> is your function called "returnFalse" also?
[13:05:30] <gnarf> :)
[13:05:46] <DaveMethvin> well that would be the OBVIOUS name, eh?
[13:05:50] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:05:59] <gnarf> can i just use that?
[13:06:06] <gnarf> since manip depends on events anyway
[13:06:16] <DaveMethvin> is that in cleanData?
[13:06:18] <gnarf> yeah
[13:06:27] <DaveMethvin> ya know, i always thought that belonged in events
[13:06:33] <gnarf> and animation
[13:06:39] <gnarf> and data
[13:06:51] <gnarf> but like
[13:07:04] <gnarf> i just got an error that this function is already declared
[13:07:05] <gnarf> so
[13:07:13] <DaveMethvin> but only if it's combined, right?
[13:07:16] <gnarf> right
[13:07:23] <DaveMethvin> otherwise it's inside my closure
[13:07:31] <DaveMethvin> so where you gonna put it?
[13:07:46] <gnarf> i dunno
[13:07:59] <DaveMethvin> window.returnFalse is available
[13:08:02] <DaveMethvin> lol
[13:11:07] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: jQuery.returnFalse
[13:11:12] <gnarf> put it in core
[13:11:14] <gnarf> next to noop
[13:11:25] <gnarf> but
[13:11:26] <gnarf> like
[13:11:34] <DaveMethvin> i have returnTrue as well but i guess you don't need it
[13:11:34] <gnarf> eww?
[13:11:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:11:41] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[13:11:54] <gnarf> timersReturnFalse
[13:12:09] <DaveMethvin> so how are you using the function?

[13:13:05] <gnarf> because there is a chance someone calls .remove from a animation callback
[13:13:12] <gnarf> we can't actually "remove" the timer
[13:13:17] <gnarf> but we can replace it with a return false
[13:13:27] <DaveMethvin> got it
[13:14:11] <gnarf> i just don't wanna inline it
[13:14:30] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's a surprisingly sticky issue
[13:15:08] <gnarf> im open to your suggestion
[13:15:21] <DaveMethvin> how bout you make your own and we talk about a better solution for 1.8? I think I may be getting rid of mine
[13:15:55] <DaveMethvin> i want to have them return a property from Event so i can avoid lotsa function calls
[13:16:27] <gnarf> i'll call mine "emptyTimer"

[15:44:17] <gnarf> cuz i feel nice
[15:47:07] <mikesherov_> uhi
[15:48:08] <mikesherov_> wanna talk about how jsperf is down?
[15:48:42] <mikesherov_> or how about pointing me to a ticket I could work on?
[15:49:34] <gnarf> mikesherov_: heh
[15:49:58] <gnarf> mikesherov_: what do you want to work on? there is a whole list of tickets
[15:50:08] <mikesherov_> was still trying to figure out why css("notaproperty") is slower in my patch
[15:50:18] <mikesherov_> should I be working on the open 1.7 tixx?
[15:50:26] <mikesherov_> point me to a trac report
[15:51:16] <mikesherov_> hey, speaking of trac, gnarf, you know where you guys got that fancy ticket graph from?
[15:51:56] <gnarf> in the keynote?
[15:52:06] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticketgraph
[15:52:09] <gnarf> that graph?
[15:54:10] <mikesherov_> yeah, that graph
[15:54:18] <mikesherov_> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticketgraph
[15:58:20] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/report and all the triage reports are useful
[15:58:26] <gnarf> even if you're only triaging
[15:58:57] <gnarf> mikesherov_: is there like a section of code you want to look at in particular?
[15:59:42] <mikesherov_> I like css, I like dimensions, because that is what I know
[16:00:11] <danzik17> if you really wanted to be a doll, you could give some direction on http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9945 <3
[16:00:17] <gnarf> http://bugs.jquery.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&status=open&status=reopened&component=!datalink&component=!global&component=!templates&component=!web&type=bug&group=component&report=1&order=priority
[16:00:21] <mikesherov_> but in general, I'd like to work on something that helps 1.7 get released, or is a long standing bug that would be nice to fix whenever
[16:00:30] <danzik17> i looked at it briefly, but dunno how to proceed - getComputedStyle won't return a pixel value for hidden elements, and i remember seeing that reflows to get stuff were frowned upon somewhere
[16:01:32] <mikesherov_> OK, so I'm looking at 9945
[16:01:58] <gnarf> docs#9945
[16:01:59] <bot-t> [#9945] Percentage Width Elements in Hidden Divs (open bug) - http://jqbug.com/9945
[16:02:31] <gnarf> danzik17: might be a wontfix / cantfix
[16:02:47] <gnarf> danzik17: unless you can think a way around it
[16:03:08] <gnarf> but i don't think there is a solid cross browser way, and showing the container isn't really an option
[16:03:19] <danzik17> gnarf: no, but the thing is that IE <= 8 actually returns a usable value since .currentStyle works
[16:03:23] <danzik17> so it's kinda inconsistent
[16:03:44] <mikesherov_> yeah, there are all sorts of funky problems with elements that are in hidden parents
[16:03:59] <gnarf> danzik17: we basically say that a lot of calls don't work on hidden elements
[16:04:07] <gnarf> offset, etc
[16:04:08] <mikesherov_> that's what prompted the 3 different tixx I worked on
[16:04:29] <mikesherov_> but I intend to fix them all!
[16:04:41] <mikesherov_> if it's possible to do in a lightweight, performant way of course
[16:04:49] <mikesherov_> which is why I wish jsperf was up right now
[16:04:58] <danzik17> gnarf: fair enough, looks like im moving on to whatevers next
[16:05:49] <mikesherov_> although
[16:05:59] <gnarf> i have a sticky one in UI effects too
[16:06:00] <gnarf> ;)
[16:06:19] <mikesherov_> really, if jQuery is known to not work on children of hidden elements
[16:06:41] <mikesherov_> it shouldn't really return any value if it knows it's a percentage
[16:07:12] <mikesherov_> but that's not really fixing anything, just admitting defeat ;-)
[16:07:18] <mikesherov_> But maybe that's a needsdoc issue
[16:07:50] <mikesherov_> and really, if we wanted to b crazy about it, we could do a russian-doll brute force using cssswap
[16:07:53] <danzik17> mikesherov_: Right, i was gonna propose that if the returned values matches like rpercent /%$/ or something, return 0
[16:08:20] <mikesherov_> right now, the cssHooks for width and height do the following
[16:08:28] <mikesherov_> see if offsetWidth > 0, if so, use that
[16:09:04] <mikesherov_> if not, do a cssSwap on the element (turning display:none into visibility:hidden), and then test for offsetWidth again
[16:09:28] <mikesherov_> and if offsetWidth still fails, it's one of those hidden child, so fallback to computed/currentStyle
[16:09:43] <mikesherov_> so if we wanted to kill all of these problems, we could do a russian doll
[16:10:04] <mikesherov_> keep cssSwapping all the way up until offsetWidth returns an actual value
[16:10:13] <mikesherov_> but that seems like way overkill
[16:10:34] <danzik17> that could cause a bunch of dom reflows and some weirdness since visibility:hidden still takes up page space
[16:11:08] <mikesherov_> the fact that visibility:hidden takes up page space is precisely why it's done ;-)
[16:11:52] <mikesherov_> I'm not saying it's a good nor performant nor sane answer, but it would work
[16:14:27] <mikesherov_> or, if we wanted to be crazy about it even further, we could actually figure out the pixelwidth from the percentage using the hack that's already used in the currentStyle override
[16:14:36] <mikesherov_> brb

[17:40:32] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i don't think i have any outstanding pulls really
[17:40:42] <gnarf> at least nothing around a $.isNaN
[17:40:53] <gnarf> so no conflicts with my 1.7 work
[17:40:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah mainly a courtesy call ... i just hate conflicts :)
[17:41:10] <gnarf> appreciated
[17:41:20] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: there is one pull that should be an easy landing
[17:41:29] <gnarf> the stop( [queue, ] ) one
[17:41:34] <gnarf> ;)

[18:16:37] <gnarf> we need to do something about the :focus selector test returning a failure
[18:19:14] <gnarf> looks green on http://swarm.jquery.org/job/28/
[18:22:55] <gnarf> i thought we found that people were using isNaN...
[18:23:11] <DaveMethvin> like 5 people
[18:23:17] <DaveMethvin> i'm going to email them :P
[18:23:28] <DaveMethvin> and we'll note it in the blog
[18:23:40] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: am i misusing $.isNaN in color?
[18:23:46] <DaveMethvin> "if you're using the undocumented $.isNaN, SURPRISE!
[18:23:47] <gnarf> it doesn't feel like the right function there anyway
[18:24:24] <DaveMethvin> you could use it NOW, we're documenting $.isNumeric :)

[18:25:30] <DaveMethvin> are you on the jquery-bugs-team list?
[18:25:37] <DaveMethvin> we had a thread about it
[18:25:57] <DaveMethvin> we don't have a jquery-core-team list, strangely enough
[18:27:44] <jqcommit> [jquery] dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/-AsXRQ
[18:27:44] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Squashed commit of the following: - Corey Frang
[18:28:26] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: how do you usually edit the log messages to make them pretty?
[18:28:37] <DaveMethvin> clearly that isn't the summary i wanted
[18:28:58] <DaveMethvin> it drops me into vim and I can edit but never am quite sure what i can remove or rename
[18:30:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: delete anything you want to
[18:30:54] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: anything not # commented
[18:31:03] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: just edit the commit in vim tho, yeah
[18:31:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah, comparing the commits i see i have more latitude than I thought
[18:32:12] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #114: STILL FAILING in 4 min 20 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/114/
[18:32:13] <jq-jenkins> dave.methvin: Squashed commit of the following:
[18:32:25] <gnarf> there are a bunch of pro PR handling suggestions on the ui wiki
[18:32:35] <DaveMethvin> i'll check them out
[18:32:42] <gnarf> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/40154555/Pull-Requests
[18:32:58] <gnarf> like not even using a branch on your local
[18:33:09] <gnarf> jsut checkout the remote, test, squash merge it with master
[18:33:48] <gnarf> also "adding a remote repo" is way easier with this script jzaefferer linked me too called "hub"
[18:34:03] <gnarf> which lets you just hub remote add -f dmethvin for instance
[18:34:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[18:35:04] <gnarf> so like
[18:35:10] <gnarf> i just need to remove isNaN
[18:35:12] <DaveMethvin> do you have a link for that? i've heard of it
[18:35:34] <gnarf> https://github.com/defunkt/hub i think
[18:37:48] <DaveMethvin> for isNaN you could do it inline, it's not a lot of code
[18:38:19] <DaveMethvin> so on that jenkins/swarm link, where is the actual info about wahat is failing?
[18:38:34] <DaveMethvin> gnarf ^^ i figured it would be reachable from the lik
[18:38:36] <DaveMethvin> link*
[18:39:16] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: sadly it doesn't seem to be
[18:39:29] <gnarf> the console output
[18:39:31] <gnarf> has a link to it
[18:39:33] <DaveMethvin> ok then i feel better
[18:39:37] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/29/
[18:39:59] <gnarf> i think the issue is more that there aren't every client on the swarm atm
[18:40:14] <DaveMethvin> ok, got it now
[18:40:40] <gnarf> but yeah, console output
[18:40:44] <gnarf> look for the tests section
[18:40:58] <DaveMethvin> ok and yeah, that's the focus thang
[18:41:09] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/master/jquery.color.js#L161 i think thats all i need
[18:41:17] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i really think we should put a test around that test
[18:41:29] <gnarf> to not run the test if we know its gonna fail cuz the browser isn't focused
[18:41:30] <gnarf> or something
[18:41:42] <gnarf> as much as it sucks to hide the unit test
[18:41:48] <gnarf> having a consistent failure sucks more
[18:41:53] <DaveMethvin> agreed, it's really annoying to see the fails
[18:42:00] <DaveMethvin> too much crying wolf
[18:42:27] <DaveMethvin> so what kind of test can we use? Is there a var available or something we can add to the testing url maybe?
[18:43:16] <DaveMethvin> obtw on the color plugin, what do you want do to if value == ""  because that wont' be caught by that
[18:43:37] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: it should either be parseFloat / ~~ 'ed by the time it gets there
[18:43:47] <gnarf> ?eval ~~""
[18:43:48] <bot-t> gnarf: 0
[18:43:54] <gnarf> ?eval parseFloat("")
[18:43:55] <bot-t> gnarf: NaN
[18:44:03] <DaveMethvin> sweet
[18:44:17] <DaveMethvin> the ~~ operator is sooooo cool looking
[18:44:32] <gnarf> i do like it
[18:44:47] <gnarf> ?eval Math.floor( "" )
[18:44:48] <bot-t> gnarf: 0
[18:44:50] <DaveMethvin> haven't had the need to use it in jquery yet

[18:49:41] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: did you look at that fix for 9217 by any chance?
[18:49:47] <gnarf> i think this is the right thing to be doing
[18:49:51] <gnarf> just not sure how we unit test it yet
[18:50:25] <DaveMethvin> looking at it now
[18:52:02] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: it prolly is the right thing to do, but the overhead worries me
[18:52:40] <gnarf> looping timers for every item removed
[18:52:40] <gnarf> hrm
[18:53:01] <gnarf> i could make it only do it on elements that have an expando
[18:53:07] <DaveMethvin> cleanData is a performance nightmare
[18:53:08] <gnarf> because that should be true...
[18:53:43] <DaveMethvin> how many timers are there in general? It's a really small number most of the time
[18:53:46] <gnarf> then it wont catch "unqueued" animation of scrollTop
[18:53:57] <DaveMethvin> tryna think of other speedups
[18:54:02] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: one per property per active animation
[18:54:31] <gnarf> so like, animating height,width,paddingTop,paddingBottom,paddingLeft..... each is a timer
[18:54:35] <DaveMethvin> so maybe a coupla dozen at most
[18:54:53] <DaveMethvin> unless you're writing a game or something
[18:54:56] <gnarf> right
[18:55:05] <gnarf> probably 0
[18:55:07] <gnarf> :)
[18:55:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah in which case we aren't adding much since it never goes through the loop at all
[18:55:47] <gnarf> right
[18:56:34] <gnarf> btw DaveMethvin https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/541#issuecomment-2374775
[18:56:35] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by gnarf37 (1d, 7h ago): .stop( [queue,] clearQueue, gotoEnd )
[18:56:36] <gnarf> ;)
[18:56:50] <gnarf> don't forget that vital step of a manual pull merge
[18:56:51] <gnarf> ;)
[18:57:10] <DaveMethvin> yep, which i did ... :/
[18:57:22] <gnarf> sokay, at least it was my pull ;)
[18:58:43] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: with a single commit pull - you can usually just cherry-pick it too
[18:58:46] <gnarf> instead of merging
[18:59:05] <DaveMethvin> i saw that in the protips, good idea
[18:59:29] <gnarf> also note how we would merge "stable fixes" to 1-8 ;)
[19:03:37] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: could we check to see whether the element is connected to a document instead?
[19:04:11] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: probably?
[19:04:21] <DaveMethvin> can't argue with that answer :P
[19:04:31] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: in the timers loop
[19:04:36] <gnarf> we could check timer.elem
[19:04:54] <gnarf> but then you are checking document state of every property every tick
[19:05:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah, although it's for something that fires a few times a second
[19:05:13] <gnarf> er document state for every element for each animated property for each tick
[19:05:49] <DaveMethvin> i dunno how expensive it is to check that
[19:05:58] <gnarf> i would think the perf hit in .remove() / .cleanData() less expensive
[19:06:09] <gnarf> but again
[19:06:18] <DaveMethvin> but it's clustered in one place so perhaps more noticeable
[19:06:19] <gnarf> if we had 100 elements getting removed
[19:06:28] <gnarf> and 100 properties animating
[19:07:09] <DaveMethvin> lots of little overhead is sometimes better than one big overhead party
[19:07:23] <DaveMethvin> "if you reallly need to haul ass, make two trips"
[19:07:56] <DaveMethvin> what
[19:08:02] <DaveMethvin> is the cheapest way to check attachement
[19:08:12] <DaveMethvin> does .ownerDocument change?
[19:08:23] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: unknown
[19:08:30] <DaveMethvin> or do we have to use jQuery.contains i wonder?
[19:08:47] <DaveMethvin> time for some tests .. did jsperf ever come back?
[19:09:08] <DaveMethvin> NOOOOOO!
[19:09:16] <timmywil> hi
[19:09:18] * gnarf shakes a fist at matjas
[19:09:22] <DaveMethvin> ohai!
[19:09:33] <gnarf> timmywil: we are talking perf hit for that docs#9217 pull
[19:09:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:10:39] <DaveMethvin> i think we should put a try/catch around it ...
[19:10:41] * DaveMethvin runs
[19:10:54] <timmywil> hmm, why are we not just calling stop
[19:11:13] <DaveMethvin> hey ask gnarf, he's the amination expert
[19:11:40] <gnarf> timmywil: .stop() doesn't recursively check shit
[19:11:44] <gnarf> also
[19:11:50] <gnarf> maybe .stop() should do the return false thing
[19:12:07] <gnarf> to fix those timers from getting skipped while midpoint
[19:12:28] <gnarf> but - tiny little loop seemed preferable to adding function call on a jQuery object we don't yet have
[19:12:54] <gnarf> $( elem ).stop() seem'ed excessively wasteful
[19:14:46] <timmywil> I'm not following
[19:15:24] <timmywil> I don't think cleanData deal with timers
[19:15:28] <timmywil> should*
[19:15:48] <gnarf> timmywil: so instead it should $( elem ).stop() ?
[19:16:15] <DaveMethvin> in cleanData?
[19:16:38] <gnarf> the for loop over the timers seems preferable perf wise...
[19:16:48] <gnarf> since thats what .stop() does anyway
[19:16:55] <timmywil> perf doesn't matter. remove only happens once
[19:17:13] <gnarf> timmywil: but cleanData happens once for every element being removed (recursively)
[19:17:19] <DaveMethvin> yeah but if we put it in cleanData we're  ...  yeah
[19:17:31] <timmywil> it doesn't need to be in cleanDAta
[19:17:41] <DaveMethvin> i would rather deal with the removed element on the next tick
[19:17:58] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: meaning deal with the potentailly removed element on every tick?
[19:18:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:18:20] <DaveMethvin> the number of timers in play aren't that large are they?
[19:18:31] <DaveMethvin> as long as the cost of determining if it's removed isn't high
[19:18:34] <gnarf> i could maybe get on board with that if we could rely on like domelement.jQueryBlewThisShitUp = true or something to make that check super fast
[19:18:46] <DaveMethvin> and we only need to do it for ie<9 it seems
[19:19:07] * DaveMethvin wants to see the feature test for that
[19:19:31] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.support.animationsGetAllExplodey
[19:19:40] <timmywil> this is sounding like more work than it needs to do
[19:20:07] <gnarf> i think clearing out the timers for removed elements seems quick
[19:20:23] <gnarf> can't jsperf it
[19:20:27] * gnarf shakes fist at matjas
[19:21:04] <DaveMethvin> welll, maybe pull 542 really IS the best way
[19:21:04] <gnarf> its all super fast comparisons
[19:21:14] <timmywil> this is only a problem on .remove() right?
[19:21:20] <timmywil> .detach() can keep animating
[19:21:27] <gnarf> timmywil: i imagine .detach() would blow up too
[19:21:33] <DaveMethvin> prolly
[19:21:44] <gnarf> which is a good point
[19:21:53] <DaveMethvin> and we don't cleanData there ...
[19:21:55] <gnarf> in favor of DaveMethvin - check it
[19:22:00] <gnarf> in the tick
[19:22:20] <gnarf> but like checking if its in the document seems way more expensive
[19:22:43] <timmywil> why not just start .remove with this.stop() at the top?  I still don't see why this needs to be in the tick
[19:23:08] <gnarf> timmywil: .parent().remove()
[19:23:39] <timmywil> still fine?
[19:24:14] <gnarf> timmywil: .stop() doesn't stop all children elements
[19:24:29] <gnarf> .remove() via cleanData() does
[19:24:44] <timmywil> shit
[19:24:50] <timmywil> i don't like this
[19:25:36] <DaveMethvin> hmm, could we check elem.parentNode==null in the tick?
[19:26:15] <DaveMethvin> that won't work for animating plain objects which i know some people have encouraged, and i hate to check isPlainObject too
[19:26:41] <timmywil> lol, try/catch is looking pretty good
[19:27:47] <timmywil> anyway, we have a fail in queue: delay() can be stopped
[19:28:01] <timmywil> something recent
[19:28:52] <gnarf> hrm
[19:28:57] <gnarf> timmywil: where?
[19:29:13] <timmywil> i'm looking at chrome
[19:29:17] <gnarf> oh
[19:29:18] <gnarf> shit
[19:30:25] <gnarf> hrm
[19:30:30] <gnarf> i'm not seeing it on master
[19:31:43] <gnarf> but that test is buggy
[19:31:49] <gnarf> using old (now fixed) .stop
[19:32:16] <DaveMethvin> you talking about .toggle().stop().toggle()?
[19:32:43] <timmywil> idk, i can reproduce consistently
[19:32:45] <timmywil> no
[19:32:55] <gnarf> timmywil: https://gist.github.com/42572fa8c2053e049529
[19:33:07] <gnarf> does that fix it?
[19:33:33] <DaveMethvin> no probs here with chrome 14
[19:33:42] <timmywil> yes
[19:33:46] <timmywil> that fixed it
[19:33:52] <gnarf> timmywil: sorry
[19:34:01] <gnarf> dunno why that wasn't failing on my local

[19:59:12] <gnarf> did we hate every option?
[19:59:18] <gnarf> because I'm willing to say wontfix for now too
[19:59:27] <gnarf> but its arcane
[20:00:34] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #116: STILL FAILING in 4 min 43 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/116/
[20:00:35] <jq-jenkins> dave.methvin: Tweak live-blur() test to silence a IE8 swarm fail.
[20:00:47] <timmywil> fixes for it are fugly
[20:05:05] <DaveMethvin> so would checking for .parentNode work?
[20:06:41] <DaveMethvin> bot-t has left the building
[20:08:02] <gnarf> .parentNode
[20:08:21] <gnarf> when a tree is removed, does an item still have parent?
[20:09:02] <timmywil> limiting animations to only things that are attached could cause some problems
[20:09:08] <gnarf> agree
[20:09:26] <timmywil> what is the actual error in IE?
[20:13:15] <timmywil> i don't think more logic should be added to tick, but if the error is something dumb like "scrollTop is undefined", we could simply check if the animated element actually has what we're animating and stop if it doesn't
[20:13:53] * gnarf is trying to reproduce
[20:14:52] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/2I2J0N1p032D3K1T1C0v
[20:15:05] <gnarf> timmywil: its fx.elem[ fx.prop ] = fx.now
[20:15:37] <timmywil> fx.elem && ?
[20:15:54] <gnarf> fx.elem is an element
[20:15:58] <gnarf> but its detached
[20:16:13] <gnarf> and therefore access is denied to set its scrollTop
[20:16:17] <gnarf> because this is ie
[20:16:20] <gnarf> of course
[20:16:28] <timmywil> ah, still there, right
[20:16:45] <gnarf> and browserstack is pretty awesoe
[20:22:13] <gnarf> so is the cleanData option bad?
[20:22:18] <gnarf> we need jsperf to know for sure right?
[20:22:40] <timmywil> seems pretty dirty
[20:22:50] <gnarf> it makes sense thos
[20:22:54] <gnarf> we clean the "data" cache
[20:23:04] <gnarf> we clean the "timers" cache
[20:23:22] <gnarf> we clean the "events"
[20:23:39] <gnarf> sweep sweep
[20:23:55] <gnarf> i was never very good at cleaning though
[20:23:59] <timmywil> not the concept, the implementation.  but we've put ourselves in a corner
[20:24:13] <gnarf> i can probably get a better solution in 1.8
[20:24:33] <gnarf> if an element can know about all currently running timers anyway
[20:24:44] <gnarf> or send a message to
[20:25:00] <timmywil> there must be something different about fx.elem from just a disconnected node
[20:25:12] <gnarf> isDisconnected
[20:25:16] <timmywil> i can still get scrollTop on a disconnecte dnode
[20:25:24] <gnarf> can we set it tho?
[20:25:44] <timmywil> good point
[20:25:47] <timmywil> readonly
[20:25:58] <gnarf> so like thats the bug
[20:25:59] <gnarf> its there
[20:26:01] <gnarf> but protected
[20:26:57] <timmywil> man, is there really no way to check for readonly
[20:27:04] <gnarf> actually
[20:27:06] <gnarf> fuck this
[20:27:13] <gnarf> its in a step function
[20:27:36] <gnarf> $.fx.step.scrollTop = function ( fx ) {// check for disconnected shit };
[20:27:55] <timmywil> i was getting there...
[20:28:04] <timmywil> :)
[20:29:07] <gnarf> its not a "real" style anyway
[20:30:21] <timmywil> i like that better
[20:30:30] <timmywil> DaveMethvin?
[20:30:34] <DaveMethvin> yep
[20:30:46] <DaveMethvin> whoa you guys been talking
[20:31:14] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: step function for scrollTop to check for disconnected.  done.
[20:32:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah, just finished the novel above .. can't wait for the movie
[20:32:31] <DaveMethvin> solution sounds good tho
[20:33:45] <gnarf> so like
[20:33:53] <gnarf> elem.parentNode isn't a docFrag
[20:33:56] <gnarf> is that our best bet
[20:33:57] <gnarf> ?
[20:34:07] <gnarf> and we could probably feature test this
[20:35:18] <gnarf> try { document.createElement("p").scrollTop = 10; jQuery.support.setScrollDisconnected = true; } catch( e ) {}; ;)
[20:35:22] * gnarf laughs
[20:36:26] <timmywil> i saw a try pass in python the other day
[20:36:31] <timmywil> just a random note
[20:36:37] <timmywil> they were trying pass!
[20:37:44] <gnarf> how do i figure out if something is a doc frag? :)
[20:37:55] <gnarf> anyone?
[20:37:56] <paul_irish> is it off-dom?
[20:37:58] <timmywil> wouldn't parentNode just be null?
[20:38:07] <paul_irish> hmmm
[20:38:11] <paul_irish> hmmmmm
[20:38:11] <gnarf> paul_irish: it was removed, it might have a parent in an off-dom
[20:38:15] <paul_irish> weird
[20:38:20] <gnarf> ???
[20:38:21] <paul_irish> i have no idea
[20:38:25] <gnarf> like it could be the child of something removed
[20:38:36] <gnarf> although let me verify this
[20:38:57] <timmywil> ah, then parentNode would still be its parent
[20:41:41] <timmywil> oh btw, doc frags have nodeType 11
[20:42:51] <gnarf> so like ?
[20:43:31] <paul_irish> i dont think they can be parentnodes tho....
[20:43:58] <paul_irish> maybe youd have to keep track of all fragments and look inside them for that node?
[20:44:00] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/NGBaX/13/
[20:44:04] <gnarf> seems to fix it
[20:44:04] <paul_irish> hardddd
[20:44:05] <timmywil> they can
[20:44:06] <paul_irish> o
[20:45:45] <timmywil> but i don't think they will be for a removal
[20:45:53] <timmywil> it'll just be null
[20:46:52] <gnarf> so that fiddle seems to fix the bug
[20:47:30] <timmywil> it will for almost everything
[20:48:08] <gnarf> paul_irish: if only you were in ui-dev ....
[20:49:16] <timmywil> actually, maybe it will for everything
[20:49:20] <timmywil> oooo
[20:49:26] <timmywil> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/NGBaX/15/
[20:49:52] <timmywil> still fine
[20:51:53] <timmywil> *approval stamp*
[20:52:01] <timmywil> boosh
[20:52:50] <gnarf> timmywil: feature test? :)
[20:52:57] <gnarf> or do we just do this for every browser
[20:53:05] <timmywil> it has a parentNode, but it must not matter at that point
[20:53:11] <timmywil> hmmm
[20:53:43] <timmywil> i'm not sure it's worth the feature test
[20:54:16] <timmywil> we can skip setting scrollTop on disconnected nodes in Chrome too :)
[20:54:30] <gnarf> it actually might speed up the set anyway not having to check style
[20:55:10] <timmywil> bonus
[20:58:00] <gnarf> im gonna blow up the current branch and replace with this

[21:11:28] <gnarf> does 543 feel less dirty now?

[21:11:52] <jq-jenkins> timmywillisn: Do not call getElements on a script tag. Avoids unnecessary execution. Fixes #10176.
[21:12:03] <timmywil> yup
[21:12:20] <gnarf> +33 now instead of +28
[21:12:43] <timmywil> scrollTop tho yea?
[21:13:01] <timmywil> hehe, you've got scrollRight
[21:13:27] <gnarf> jesus
[21:13:27] <timmywil> also, i'm sure we can throw together a test for that
[21:13:31] <gnarf> no change
[21:13:35] <gnarf> gzip size
[21:13:43] <gnarf> -2 minified
[21:13:44] <gnarf> ;)
[21:13:46] <timmywil> nice!
[21:14:14] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/33/ lame selector :focus test
[21:14:41] <timmywil> gnarf: you see my note^
[21:14:56] <timmywil> there ain't no scrollRight
[21:15:11] <gnarf> timmywil: fixed
[21:15:19] <timmywil> hehe, cool
[21:15:39] <gnarf> fixed and pushed before i reported that it made no diff in the gzip size
[21:17:05] <gnarf> thanks for catching my sleepy code brain
[21:20:31] <gnarf> im out for the night
[21:20:47] <timmywil> gnarf: let's do a test too.  wont' be hard
[21:21:01] <gnarf> timmywil: if you got a test in mind....
[21:21:05] <timmywil> but no worries tonight
[21:21:26] <gnarf> i mean, the only test we know about causes ie to execption in "disconnected" areas which prolly isn't what we want
[21:21:33] <timmywil> animate( scrollTop, 100)….setInterval( remove, 50)
[21:21:41] <gnarf> timmywil: slow timers? :)
[21:21:46] <gnarf> honestly
[21:22:07] <timmywil> just giving an idea
[21:22:09] <gnarf> i think the same approach i used for the "callback exceptions don't cause loops" fix might work
[21:22:09] <timmywil> 10 5
[21:22:13] <timmywil> 20 10
[21:22:22] <gnarf> break in and call tick manually
[21:22:40] <gnarf> then wrap a tick in a try
[21:22:48] <gnarf> and if it catches, ok( false )
[21:23:21] <timmywil> or maybe just $('<div></div>').animate( scrollTop...
[21:24:06] <timmywil> http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/cdrYt/  this already worked btw :D
[21:24:20] <timmywil> anyway, don't let me hold you up
[21:24:30] <timmywil> have a good night
[21:26:49] <gnarf> timmywil: well we don't want to make an exception show up in ie do we?
[21:27:26] <timmywil> what do you mean? it won't anymore
[21:36:56] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/NGBaX/18/ doesn't seem to cause an error
[21:43:50] <gnarf> wtf
[21:47:13] <timmywil> i need me some sleep, night gnarf
[21:47:25] <gnarf> yeah
[21:47:28] <gnarf> ill f with it tomorrow
[21:47:36] <timmywil> i'll be around
