[08:52:16] <jaubourg> hi there
[09:19:44] <cwdoh-notebook> hi jullian.
[11:53:55] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin pushed 2 new commits to 06master: 02http://git.io/81-Ayw
[11:53:55] <jqcommit> 13jquery/06master 141fb2f92 15Dave Methvin: Fix #3827. Get the correct checkbox status for a click handler.
[11:53:55] <jqcommit> 13jquery/06master 14b7ec6dd 15Dave Methvin: Fix #12868. Use native focus/blur to get event order right.
[11:54:21] <DaveMethvin> well that was exhausting
[11:59:18] <snover> is it worth it sometimes
[12:02:21] <DaveMethvin> well snover it did feel good fixing docs#3827 given how long it's been around
[12:02:24] <bot-t> [#3827] Checkbox state inconsistent in click event handler (closed bug: fixed in v1.9) - http://jqbug.com/3827
[12:02:41] <DaveMethvin> waiting for the first bug report about some strange side effect of the fix
[12:04:04] <snover> ‚Äúhey, i relied on that!‚Äù
[12:04:23] <DaveMethvin> slowly i turned
[12:05:52] <snover> we should never try to fix anything for anyone because it turns out someone needs it
[12:06:12] <DaveMethvin> feels that way sometimes
[12:06:17] <snover> just create custom versions for every individual
[12:06:23] <snover> oh this is broken for you? here have this patched version
[12:06:35] <DaveMethvin> we just need a global flag
[12:06:50] <DaveMethvin> $.changeCheckBoxClickBehavior = true;
[12:08:55] <snover> other things i love: patches that nobody lands in 7 months
[12:09:00] <snover> that no longer apply cleanly
[12:09:07] <snover> so I have to manually rewrite them
[12:09:17] <snover> because the maintainer of a component has decided not to do their job
[12:09:38] <snover> definitely not happening right now‚Ä¶ :|
[12:09:38] <DaveMethvin> abandoned pull requests are never fun
[12:09:54] <snover> DaveMethvin: i think it is about time for our every few weeks chat too
[12:10:09] <DaveMethvin> uh oh, my homework isn't done
[12:10:48] <DaveMethvin> this next week i want to get 1.9 in shape and then was going to turn visions of 2.0 dancing in my head
[12:11:17] <snover> well you don‚Äôt need to worry about it being not dnoe
[12:11:44] <snover> this long weekend is the first time i‚Äôve actually had an opportunity to do anything non-client-related in a month
[12:11:57] <DaveMethvin> i KNOW how you feel
[12:17:51] <snover> for some reason komodo has decided to ignore project-specific lint settings today which is great

[12:25:08] <DaveMethvin> swarmy is a liar!

[12:26:14] <DaveMethvin> pants on fire
[12:26:59] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/Byc23A
[12:26:59] <jqcommit> 13jquery/06master 146b00b3c 15Dave Methvin: Close #10882. Test case for "hover" event in 1.9
[12:27:05] <DaveMethvin> take that!
[12:29:30] <snover> oh mannnn.
[12:30:22] <DaveMethvin> ok ticket count, you're goin' DOWN!
[12:30:29] <mikesherov> BOOM
[12:30:38] <mikesherov> Nothing feels better than a plummeting ticket count
[12:31:01] <mikesherov> jQueryUI is hovering near 400 right now
[12:31:05] <DaveMethvin> well i wouldn't say NOTING
[12:31:07] <DaveMethvin> NOTHING
[12:31:15] <mikesherov> um, some things?
[12:31:16] <DaveMethvin> but it's pretty good
[12:31:27] <mikesherov> well, it depends on the steepness
[12:31:39] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: hero night
[12:31:59] <mikesherov> what feels good is that I finally beat a MySQL abstraction layer into mergeatron
[12:32:08] <mikesherov> just finalizing testing now
[12:32:14] <DaveMethvin> yay, cause i could really use it
[12:32:22] <mikesherov> and than linking up with gnarf to install it
[12:32:56] <DaveMethvin> after the last few tix i've wrestled with oldIE, 2.0 can't come soon enough
[12:33:26] <mikesherov> beware the allure
[12:33:37] <ryanneufeld> ?boom
[12:33:38] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[12:33:49] <mikesherov> SOMEONE is going to have to stick around and support 1.9 and try to keep parity with 2.0
[12:34:00] * mikesherov points to hisself
[12:34:20] <mikesherov> 14% of the internet is counting on me
[12:34:33] <mikesherov> good luck, we're all counting on you
[12:34:33] <DaveMethvin> help me mikey-wan kenobe
[12:34:55] <mikesherov> when 2.0 comes out, a million voices will suddenly cry out
[12:34:59] <DaveMethvin> in joy
[12:35:03] <mikesherov> HAHAHA
[12:35:20] <DaveMethvin> okay now let me look at the pull q
[12:35:27] <mikesherov> I JUST dropped IE7 support two weeks ago
[12:40:52] <ryanneufeld> o/ hight five mikesherov
[12:41:25] <ryanneufeld> also, mikesherov that thing we spoke about, things are in motion now, Thanks for the advice.
