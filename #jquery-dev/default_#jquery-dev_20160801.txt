[02:41:10] <CuriousMind> I would put .ajaxError in my button event listener function because when I click button, .ajaxError always checks for an error correct?
[02:41:20] <CuriousMind> Don't know how to use .ajaxError, I checked out the documentation already

[16:04:13] <dherman_> gibson042: curious - is ponyfill a glorious typo, or just something i have no idea about?
[16:06:29] <gibson042> dherman_: A ponyfill is a polyfill that guarantees an interface without modifying the enclosing environment. I think sindresorhus coined the term.
[16:07:14] <dherman_> That is awesome, totally stealing that ;)  Thanks!
