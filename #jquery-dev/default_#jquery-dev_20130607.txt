[13:33:11] <scott_gonzalez_> snover: Is there any interest in having dojo use a non-dojo-specific polyfill for Pointer Events?
[13:33:58] <scott_gonzalez_> Also, is there any interest in removing the abstraction that's in dojo in favor of Pointer Events only?
[13:34:03] <scott_gonzalez_> https://github.com/dojo/dojo/blob/master/touch.js#L241-L251
[13:34:11] <snover> god that code sucks, why did you have to link to it
[13:35:04] <snover> I personally am 100% in favour of only using pointer events
[13:35:24] <snover> in fact we are working on something internally at SP that does just that
[13:35:26] <scott_gonzalez_> I linked to it because I couldn't find equivalent code in dojo2-core
[13:36:13] <scott_gonzalez_> We're trying to get everyone to just collaborate on the Polymer Pointer Events polyfill
[13:37:29] <scott_gonzalez_> https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/polymer-dev/WCh3wUikAqg
[13:39:00] <snover> outside of a couple of my coworkers i don’t think anyone working on dojo right now is forward-looking enough to understand any of this
[13:39:44] <scott_gonzalez_> So just do it and then they'll understand :-P
[13:40:06] <snover> so this is actually going to shim the DOM API?
[13:40:42] <scott_gonzalez_> yeah
[13:41:03] <scott_gonzalez_> We'll see what we end up with once oldIE support lands...
[13:41:39] <snover> old IE? mehhhhhh :)
[13:45:31] <snover> I have to admit I do not understand what this has to do with jquery
[13:47:18] <snover> I mean, considering how people scream bloody murder whenever 2 bytes are added to core’s file size, how will people ever want to use a “massive” shim
[13:49:03] <scott_gonzalez_> Well, we don't really want to write our own polyfill.
[13:49:11] <scott_gonzalez_> So we're going to pull this in.
[13:49:44] <scott_gonzalez_> It will become a requirement for jQuery UI at some point.
[13:56:12] <snover> you can’t just be like “jquery 2, ie9+ only” ?
[13:57:13] <scott_gonzalez_> I don't see how that helps.
[13:57:30] <scott_gonzalez_> But even if it did, jQuery UI uses jQuery 1.x
[13:57:45] <snover> then you have ES5 and DOM 2 Events to work with
[13:57:55] <snover> instead of ES3 and IE proprietary events
[13:58:13] <snover> I’m speaking to the polyfill; I don’t care *at all* about old IE
[13:58:22] <scott_gonzalez_> You also have lots of people who won't use it then.
[13:59:04] <scott_gonzalez_> Polymer is currently IE 10+
[13:59:22] <snover> i feel very strongly that if people are going to continue to try to develop for ancient browsers that it shouldn’t drag the rest of us down
[17:11:48] <afahim_> mobile web performance wise, is jquery mobile faster than jquery?
[19:07:54] <scott_gonzalez_> afahim_: jQuery Mobile is not a replacement for jQuery. It is a layer on top. If you have more questions, please ask in #jquery.
