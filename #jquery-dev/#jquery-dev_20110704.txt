[01:08:45] <NirQ> hello.. problem with jQuery 1.6.2 and jstree
[01:09:48] <NirQ> seems to be related to the latest cameliz fix in 07420566452622f37b01e69bbbdcbeeb5317e065
[08:31:12] <JohnResig> in case there is any confusion, no meeting today: It's the 4th of July here in the US (national holiday)
[08:35:20] <timmywil> JohnResig: I haven't heard anything about getting to Boston.  Was that approved?
[08:36:24] <timmywil> ajpiano: ^
