[08:45:43] <paul_irish> .
[08:45:47] <m_gol> paul_irish: as for http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/20tk9h/jsdelivr_the_advanced_open_source_public_cdn/cg6tc1a
[08:45:56] <m_gol> we'll probably freeze jquery-latest
[08:45:59] <m_gol> maybe with a warning
[08:46:09] <paul_irish> o really?
[08:46:09] <m_gol> so please not advocate using this URL for anything :)
[08:46:09] <paul_irish> hah
[08:46:38] <m_gol> we should have frozen it when you guys did
[08:46:43] <m_gol> but too late for that
[08:47:15] <paul_irish> alright updated.
[08:47:29] <m_gol> thx
[11:43:38] <JamesMGreene> isaacs __rockbot__ Domenic_ terinjokes robertkowalski nathan7 and any other NPM users in-the-know: when using Git or GitHub URLs as dependencies in a "package.json" file, does the targeted repo need to be a Node module (e.g. have its own "package.json")?
[11:43:44] <JamesMGreene> https://www.npmjs.org/doc/json.html#GitHub-URLs
[11:43:57] <JamesMGreene> https://www.npmjs.org/doc/json.html#Git-URLs-as-Dependencies
[11:44:34] <JamesMGreene> Also, can the GitHub URLs use a commit-ish hash like the Git URLs can?
