[05:44:33] <guy> when will jquery support XHR2? specifically, file upload handling.
[05:53:22] <gibson042> .
[06:53:35] <DaveMethvin> .
[06:54:17] <DaveMethvin> danheberden gnarf: we're getting a lot of stack traces again at bugs.jquery.com ... what was the change you made that seemed to fix it last time?
[09:00:05] <jaubourg> yawp
[09:00:17] <DaveMethvin> oh it's meetin' time!
[09:16:26] <louisremi> gnarf: is there an open bug for the effects rewrite, or somewhere you wrote what you intend to do?
[09:51:25] <louisremi> well...
[09:51:50] <louisremi> gnarf, are you there?
[09:53:07] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: there's your empty readme in jquery/jquery-browser
[09:53:20] <mikesherov> so isd the meeting contiuning, but here?
[09:53:29] <rwaldron> jzaefferer thank you sir
[09:53:32] <rwaldron> :)
[09:54:34] <mikesherov> by the way, making $.support lazy and embedded in the files that need it would help with modularity
[09:54:53] <mikesherov> and would help CCAO remove more code
[09:56:08] <louisremi> mikesherov: I like that idea a lot.
[09:56:12] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: yeah definitely
[09:56:25] <mikesherov> is that now going to be in 1.8?
[09:56:36] <DaveMethvin> i think we'll reorg what we can
[09:56:42] <DaveMethvin> it's not clear whether cc will be there
[09:56:47] <mikesherov> I can't imagine it can be... $.support is documented...
[09:57:04] <DaveMethvin> well that's what i was saying about breaking rules
[09:57:17] <DaveMethvin> in retrospect it was a bad idea to document that stuff
[09:57:20] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: I also wouldn't mind giving you write access to that repo, dunno if DaveMethvin or timmywil care about that?
[09:57:44] <DaveMethvin> hey it's jquery-browser, what's the worst he can do jzaefferer?
[09:57:46] <DaveMethvin>  :P
[09:57:49] <mikesherov> I mean, if we wanted to take a hit on filesize, you can make it a function that caches the values when needed or sets it when first called
[09:58:01] <rwaldron> jzaefferer DaveMethvin cool thanks
[09:58:06] <mikesherov> with the idea that it's deprecated in 1.8, and removed in 1.9
[09:58:08] <rwaldron> that will make it much easier
[09:58:30] <DaveMethvin> well let's look at the impacts and see whether we want to push it
[09:58:40] <mikesherov> k, cool
[09:58:54] <mikesherov> if it's targetted for 1.8, I'd like to take a stab at it
[09:58:58] <DaveMethvin> if we knew it was a sweet payback we could announce it asap and give people several months to adapt
[09:58:59] <mikesherov> even if it doesn't make it in
[09:59:18] <DaveMethvin> that's the ticket that timmywil has atm, i was trying to grab it but couldn't
[09:59:24] <DaveMethvin> if you want to try you're welcome
[09:59:38] <mikesherov> you know how I love submitting PR's
[09:59:50] <DaveMethvin> yes  you're very GOOD at it! :D
[10:00:17] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: your github username?
[10:00:25] <rwaldron> jzaefferer rwldrn
[10:00:34] <mikesherov> OK, I have it now
[10:00:39] <mikesherov> it's a blocker for 1.8?
[10:00:41] <mikesherov> interesting
[10:00:52] <mikesherov> I'll try it both ways
[10:00:54] <jzaefferer> rwaldron: BAM
[10:01:03] <mikesherov> breaking change, and unbreaking change, to see the filesize impact
[10:01:34] <DaveMethvin> that would be nice
[10:01:48] <DaveMethvin> also there are perf impacts, i think that was our big concern mikesherov
[10:01:59] <DaveMethvin> since we are forcing those to happen at load
[10:02:03] <mikesherov> sure, I'll jsperf it up
[10:02:05] <DaveMethvin> if we made them lazy it might not be so bad
[10:02:33] <DaveMethvin> but then again we may still be breaking code that expected it to be done non-lazy
[10:02:36] <mikesherov> I also really need that answer from jQM about simplify offset
[10:02:55] <mikesherov> well, like I said, I can make it idempotent with caching
[10:03:25] <mikesherov> so that if someone uses $.support directly before it's defined by necessity, then it'll run the support test at that moment
[10:04:24] <mikesherov> I'll see how that impacts filesize before I just yank it out like a crazy dentist
[10:04:31] <mikesherov> anyway, I g2g
[10:04:41] <mikesherov> have a great day!
[10:06:07] <louisremi> If the meeting's over I've got a question for timmywil
[10:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> re: jquery-browser, could we just make it really big and try to work with browserscope? http://code.google.com/p/browserscope/wiki/UserAgentParsing
[10:08:30] <louisremi> scott_gonzalez: I think we should avoid over-engineering it; someone already did: https://github.com/bestiejs/platform.js
[10:10:04] <louisremi> timmywil: could you explain me why you voted down on this ticket: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7641 ? (no animosity intended)
[10:17:32] <jzaefferer> hey DaveMethvin, regarding #10442, was there a discussion about it?
[10:19:16] <jzaefferer> I'm fine with tabling or even just closing that ticket, just wondering what people think about the widget factory these days
[10:20:01] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: just a minute
[10:40:46] <eddiemonge> poor bugs server
[10:47:10] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: long minute
[10:49:48] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: okay, the minute is over
[10:50:01] <DaveMethvin> so we talked about it and decided not for 1.8
[10:50:10] <DaveMethvin> maybe coordinate for 2.0?
[10:50:19] <DaveMethvin> there will be a lot of changes then, right?
[10:50:30] <DaveMethvin> like the mouse vs interaction layer
[10:51:42] <eddiemonge> is there really going to be a 2.0 now?
[10:51:56] <DaveMethvin> not now, but later :D
[10:52:22] <DaveMethvin> i was talking about jQuery UI 2.0
[10:52:40] <DaveMethvin> sorry, changed projects and versions
[10:53:07] <eddiemonge> oh ok. i keep hearing people throwing around 2.0 and i thought the official stance was 2.0 will almost always be non-existent
[10:54:27] <DaveMethvin> i'd like for there to be a 2.0
[10:56:36] <DaveMethvin> lol @ jzaefferer just saw  your title for jquery-browser
[10:59:13] <jzaefferer> :-)
[10:59:59] <jzaefferer> just read up on Scott's interaction email
[11:00:12] <jzaefferer> I don't think that overlaps with widget factory
[11:46:11] <ben_alman> man, qunit has a lot of globals
[11:50:21] <ben_alman> rworth: ping
[12:15:26] <jzaefferer> ben_alman: YOU have a lot of globals!
[12:15:42] <rworth> ben_alman: hey
[12:16:34] <jzaefferer> that, too
[12:16:36] <jzaefferer> hey Ben!
[12:16:38] <jzaefferer> how are you doing?
[12:23:34] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: check your gnarf.net email, Bradley needs to get a W-9 fromyou
[12:31:21] <ben_alman> jzaefferer: really good
[12:31:46] <ben_alman> we were in germany recently for dinner
[12:31:47] <ben_alman> :D
[12:32:09] <ben_alman> we were visiting griends in basel switzerland and well, food is really pricey there
[12:32:12] <ben_alman> friends
[12:32:40] <ben_alman> so i can now say that "i've been to germany just for chinese food"
[13:07:06] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin https://github.com/jquery/jquery-browser
[13:07:41] <DaveMethvin> I don't know whether to be happy or to cry :D
[13:15:15] <sindresorhus> rwaldron: The "jQuery.browser" link in the readme doesn't work. You forgot the api part in the url.
[13:15:35] <ben_alman> fwiw i have grunt running qunit tests headless in node now :)
[13:15:41] <ben_alman> haven't tried it with jquery
[13:15:45] * ben_alman clones
[13:17:56] <rwaldron> sindresorhus nice, thanks
[13:17:58] <rwaldron> I'll fix that
[13:21:26] <rwaldron> all set
[13:35:58] <ben_alman> jzaefferer: have you ever seen QUnit.log do this? I had to handle it in my code https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/tasks/qunit/qunit.js#L22-23
[13:37:12] <ben_alman> rwaldron: see the "Contributing" section https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/tasks/init/jquery/README.md
[13:38:34] <paul_irish> ?g node sparklines
[13:38:35] <bot-t> paul_irish, Details Page empty / Sparkline Graphs not working | drupal.org - http://drupal.org/node/1069686
[13:52:43] <jzaefferer> ben_alman: haven't seen that, nope
[13:52:58] <jzaefferer> happens only in node?
[13:53:16] <jzaefferer> ticket/test/anything welcome :-)
[13:53:40] <ben_alman> jzaefferer: i dunno
[13:53:47] <ben_alman> i have no idea why it happens
[13:54:14] <ben_alman> fwiw i have qunit running headless in grunt tho
[13:54:25] <ben_alman> and it works great with the minimal stuff i've tested
[13:56:55] <jzaefferer> cool
[13:57:15] <jzaefferer> this is the qunit integration? https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/tasks/qunit.js
[13:58:36] <jzaefferer> now that you've written that: would providing the module name for test callbacks, and test+module name for log help?
[13:58:58] <ben_alman> sec
[13:59:10] <jzaefferer> also, how stable is zombie/jsdom by now?
[13:59:18] <jzaefferer> I tried it about a year ago, was horrible back then
[13:59:18] <ben_alman> dunno but it works here
[13:59:23] <ben_alman> this works fine, sec
[13:59:26] <jzaefferer> whatcha testing with?
[13:59:50] <ben_alman> so if you have npm installed, install grunt, my build tool
[13:59:54] <ben_alman> npm install -g grunt
[14:00:15] <ben_alman> (note, the qunit task won't work in windows until they patch jsdom)
[14:00:21] <ben_alman> once grunt is installed
[14:00:29] <ben_alman> mkdir foo && cd foo
[14:00:33] <ben_alman> grunt init:jquery
[14:00:36] <ben_alman> follow the prompts
[14:00:49] <ben_alman> once done, just run grunt to lint, test and build
[14:00:55] <ben_alman> it should run the qunit tests :)
[14:01:28] <ben_alman> fwiw, i inject this right after qunit.js is loaded via grunt https://github.com/cowboy/grunt/blob/master/tasks/qunit/qunit.js so the .html file can work standalone in any browser
[14:02:56] <ben_alman> alert is how the simulated browser qunit sends messages to the parent node process
[14:03:00] <ben_alman> works great
[14:17:25] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron thanks for catching that bug with the path, i'll land it tonight
[14:17:56] <rwaldron> hold off, I'm having issues with caching
[14:18:06] <rwaldron> and I can't tell if the files are loading correctly
[14:18:07] <DaveMethvin> np, you got a few hours
[14:22:32] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin all set now
[14:22:41] <rwaldron> ben_alman had this issue earlier
[14:22:51] <rwaldron> all of the test files were 404'ing
[14:23:00] <DaveMethvin> glad you found it rwaldron
[14:23:16] <rwaldron> yeah it's all set now
[14:23:31] <rwaldron> I was also investigating the test suite
[14:23:38] <rwaldron> because I was reviewing that PR
[14:24:33] <rwaldron> 1. The include_js.php changed the semantics of the test suite
[14:24:53] <rwaldron> it makes a concatenated string of the source files
[14:25:00] <rwaldron> which is what I would assume it should do
[14:25:24] <rwaldron> but then...
[14:25:24] <rwaldron> 	$output = str_replace( "(function( jQuery ) {", "", $output );
[14:25:24] <rwaldron> 	$output = str_replace( "})( jQuery );", "", $output );
[14:25:45] <rwaldron> which changes things ever so slightly
[14:25:51] <rwaldron> because that PR with the changes to core.js
[14:26:40] <DaveMethvin> yeah i see what you mean, i thought about that but it seemed like such a massive win to do it that way
[14:27:16] <rwaldron> based on what I assume about the test suite, since 2010, that all modules are wrapped in IIFEs, I would then have to assume that he was leaking these https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/668/files#L4R1
[14:27:17] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery by gibson042 (52m, 38s ago): no ticket: smarter build to avoid redefining common subcomponent-local variables
[14:27:35] <rwaldron> but its not because include_js.php is doing the favor of wrapping the modules
[14:31:46] <rwaldron> I want to replace this...
[14:36:05] <rwaldron> we may want to keep it this way...
[14:36:12] <rwaldron> haha
[14:36:19] <rwaldron> i just realized there is some benefit here
[14:47:23] <idbentley> \q
[17:32:21] <jqcommit> [jquery] jaubourg pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/vUenUQ

[19:09:53] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: you around?
[19:12:49] <rwaldron> the I am
[19:12:52] <rwaldron> whoops
[19:12:55] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I am
[19:13:15] <DaveMethvin> hey dere, just looking at this pr to fix the local paths
[19:13:23] <DaveMethvin> is it working foryou?
[19:14:03] <DaveMethvin> brb in a sec
[19:14:11] <rwaldron> the only way to trigger that block is by removing the php portion
[19:14:21] <rwaldron> or running this on a server without php
[19:14:35] <rwaldron> but yeah, it wasn't working for ben_alman, so i investigated
[19:14:53] <rwaldron> and was able to recreate by removing the php portion
[19:16:04] <DaveMethvin> ok back
[19:16:51] <DaveMethvin> so is it supposed to be working now in the pr?
[19:20:34] <rwaldron> yeah
[19:20:54] <rwaldron> but you can only confirm that by removing the php portion
[19:21:13] <rwaldron> oh, are you referring to the hiccup i mentioned earlier?
[19:21:18] <rwaldron> yes, that's resolved
[19:21:21] <rwaldron> all good
[19:21:25] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^
[19:22:07] <DaveMethvin> ok so this branch should run locally? it doesn't seem to for me rwaldron
[19:22:38] <rwaldron> hrm
[19:22:48] <rwaldron> you're running the suite from localhost?
[19:22:53] <DaveMethvin> checking again
[19:23:23] <rwaldron> http://localhost/test/ or an equivalent?
[19:23:53] <DaveMethvin> sorry i meant file:// urls
[19:24:22] <rwaldron> shit, let me check that again
[19:24:41] <DaveMethvin> it would be good if i said what I meant :)
[19:25:13] <rwaldron> I thought we weren't running this from file:// anymore
[19:25:23] <rwaldron> didnt we discuss recently?
[19:25:28] <DaveMethvin> well try master, it kinda sorta works
[19:25:31] <rwaldron> that it doesn;t make much sense?
[19:25:37] <DaveMethvin> but now it dies horribly
[19:25:40] <rwaldron> shit
[19:25:53] <DaveMethvin> i thought our goal was to have it skip some tests for file:// urls
[19:25:58] <rwaldron> well, it was dying horribly on localhost without php
[19:26:01] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov has a ticket for that
[19:26:11] <rwaldron> let me take another look here, give me a min
[19:26:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah but it was working on localhost with php
[19:27:31] <ben_alman> i tried tests today and it assploded in my face
[19:27:41] <ben_alman> i was like "rick halp plz"
[19:27:57] <ben_alman> he held me tight while i cried
[19:28:24] <ben_alman> munki
[19:28:28] <ben_alman> oops mt
[19:28:30] <ben_alman> damn google
[19:28:48] <DaveMethvin> oh ben_alman you so funny
[19:29:19] <ben_alman> i had the crazy idea to try to run jquery's qunit index.html inside grunt
[19:29:23] <ben_alman> and got about 10 seconds in
[19:29:29] <ben_alman> before my computer caught fire
[19:29:40] <paul_irish> can it run headless?
[19:29:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah i thought you had it working now ben_alman
[19:30:10] <ben_alman> i can get a sane qunit suite running in grunt
[19:30:20] <DaveMethvin> hey what you implying
[19:30:24] <ben_alman> but the jquery HEAD was borked so i stopped trying
[19:30:53] <ben_alman> i'm hitting it through a local node connect server tho
[19:30:56] <ben_alman> so it's ignoring php
[19:31:23] <DaveMethvin> oh so that's why rwaldron saw that
[19:31:42] <ben_alman> well
[19:31:44] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin i updated it
[19:31:46] <ben_alman> actually when i saw it
[19:31:55] <ben_alman> i was running through python -m SimpleHTTPServer
[19:32:22] <ben_alman> that too only serves static files
[19:32:33] <DaveMethvin> lookin better rwaldron
[19:32:46] <rwaldron> yeah i was going to /src/
[19:32:52] <rwaldron> now to ../src/
[19:32:57] <ben_alman> yay
[19:32:59] <DaveMethvin> did you have to break ben_alman's test in the process?
[19:33:11] <rwaldron> i didnt break anything of ben_alman's
[19:33:13] <DaveMethvin> darn :P
[19:33:23] <rwaldron> I'll try harder next time.
[19:33:25] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin: i have qunit running headless through grunt
[19:33:25] <rwaldron> :D
[19:33:28] <DaveMethvin> not even his heart?
[19:33:36] <rwaldron> I could never!
[19:34:04] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman: yeah but does it work on a REAL unit test like ours?
[19:34:08] <ben_alman> haha
[19:34:20] <ben_alman> does your unit test work on a REAL unit test like yours?
[19:34:25] <DaveMethvin> hell, our unit test doesn't even work with a head
[19:35:07] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin is that all set now?
[19:35:08] <DaveMethvin> i dunno who jenkins is but if he says STILL FAILING one more time ... pow
[19:35:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah i think you got it rwaldron
[19:35:18] <DaveMethvin> thanks
[19:35:18] <rwaldron> nice
[19:35:22] <rwaldron> no problem
[19:35:34] <rwaldron> thanks ben_alman for bringing that one
[19:35:37] <ben_alman> "jQuery: write less: fail more"
[19:35:43] <rwaldron> I have to go scoop rose up
[19:35:47] <rwaldron> ben_alman ouch
[19:35:59] <ben_alman> but only the tests fail!
[19:36:02] <ben_alman> not the code
[19:36:26] <ben_alman> paul_irish: ping
[19:38:43] <paul_irish> PONG
[19:39:21] <ben_alman> paul_irish: so i added a jquery init template to grunt. update the one you have to the latest version, go into a new dir and do grunt init:jquery
[19:39:49] <ben_alman> i sent an email to adam, richard and dan for feedback on the template. i want to make sure it generates a legit jquery plugin index package.json
[19:39:56] <ben_alman> hopefully they have good feedback
[19:40:04] <ben_alman> but take a quick look and see what you think
[19:40:37] <ben_alman> i think this will update grunt: npm update -g grunt
[19:40:56] <paul_irish> gah jsdom and its busted html parsing
[19:41:11] <ben_alman> patches welcome
[19:41:21] <ben_alman> seriously though, if you know of anything better, plz

[19:43:03] <ben_alman> anything that makes jsdom better is good in my book
[19:43:04] <paul_irish> basic issue is jsdom doesnt implement the html5 parsing algo

[19:43:53] <paul_irish> my init task when finished didnt bring me back to prompt again
[19:44:07] <ben_alman> rwaldron had that too
[19:44:12] <ben_alman> need to figure what gives
[19:44:16] <ben_alman> i've yet to see that here
[19:44:33] <ben_alman> but i saw it on rick's machine today
[19:44:46] <paul_irish> huh
[19:44:52] <paul_irish> when i run grunt on this guy
[19:44:55] <ben_alman> maybe there's some way i can more vehemently process.exit()
[19:45:01] <paul_irish> Do you want to let node accept incoming network connections?
[19:45:14] <paul_irish> never seen that pop up before.
[19:45:18] <paul_irish> not for node
[19:45:20] <ben_alman> ah, yeah right now i need to start a temp server for qunit to work
[19:45:25] <ben_alman> on port 1337
[19:45:28] <paul_irish> o
[19:45:46] <ben_alman> yeah, zombie needs a http:// type url to work right, file:// won't cut it
[19:45:56] <paul_irish> i googled node sparklines before because i thought it'd be fun to track gzip'd size over time
[19:46:13] <ben_alman> so i start a quick connect server on 1337 so that zombie can connect to http://localhost:1337/test/
[19:46:26] <ben_alman> but i'm trying to figure out if there's a way to just get zombie to talk to connect w/o a physical port
[19:46:33] <ben_alman> it's the next thing on my list
