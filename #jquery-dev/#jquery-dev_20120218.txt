[02:12:44] <eforen> hihi all
[02:13:56] <eforen> So i am useing .buttonset(); on multiple things targeting them by there class (all the same class) in one command
[02:14:14] <eforen> problem is not all of them are being asembled the same
[02:15:41] <eforen> sometimes it is putting <span class="ui-button-text"> around the label by itself like it sure but sometimes its doing that and then agean <span class="ui-button-text"> so i end up with <span class="ui-button-text"><span class="ui-button-text">foobar</span></span>
