[19:41:22] <ajpiano> wow lol DaveMethvin
[19:41:32] <DaveMethvin> sup?
[19:41:32] <ajpiano> "ajpiano closed this ticket with a straw man argument claiming that there are infinite possible permutations, and thus the problem is unsolvable. ajpiano has evidently never heard of recursion, and (as demonstrated in a comment on that ticket) the problem is *trivial* to solve."
[19:41:44] <DaveMethvin> oh that guy
[19:41:52] <DaveMethvin> so yeah i just blew away that ticket
[19:41:55] <DaveMethvin> it was spam :D
[19:41:59] <ajpiano> i noticed :p
[19:44:29] <ajpiano> but i'll tell you what DaveMethvin since i saw this ticket
[19:44:36] <ajpiano> i've been reading about recursion, it sure does sound interesting!!!
[19:44:46] <DaveMethvin> lol
[19:44:58] <DaveMethvin> it's only a theory, like evolution ajpiano
[19:46:04] <ajpiano> that explains why i didn't learn about it in school
[19:46:26] <DaveMethvin> my school was run by iterationists
[19:46:49] <DaveMethvin> we learned about i and j in the garden of eden
[19:46:52] <ajpiano> i once got caught outside of class without a continuation pass
[19:47:01] <DaveMethvin> break!
[19:47:14] <ajpiano> the teacher was willing to throw an exception for me tho
[19:47:29] <DaveMethvin> damn i'm running outa jokes
[19:47:34] <ajpiano> me too
[19:47:41] <ajpiano> i think we both this one
[19:47:43] <ajpiano> win*
[20:54:17] <ajpiano> whoa, i didn't know we did 1.8.3 today
[21:00:37] <mikesherov> ajpiano: hi
[21:00:44] <mikesherov> welcome to the party
[21:04:52] <ajpiano> i guess i should tweet in the morning instead of now
