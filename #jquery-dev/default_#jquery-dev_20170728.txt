[09:14:46] <MacroMan> Where in the jQuery source can I find the code that normalizes properties on mouse events?
[09:15:30] <MacroMan> I'm looking in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event.js but I can't find anything specific to normalizing pageX and pageY which the documentation claims to normalize.

[20:01:50] <Krinkle> s5fs: mgol: I'm looking at a few Jenkins plugin upgrades now, once I'm familiar with.
[20:02:11] <Krinkle> However most I don't know, and also not sure why they are installed. It seems every major upgrade of Jenkins, a dozen or so plugins get installed by default.
[20:02:21] <Krinkle> And it's hard to keep track of which ones we started using in one of the dozens of job configurations
