[16:38:05] <DaveMethvin> I've got a bad feeling about this... http://jsbin.com/mecowewibi/4/edit?html,output
[16:38:33] <DaveMethvin> now that ready runs async, the window.onload can happen BEFORE it
[16:39:17] <DaveMethvin> i found it because it breaks a Migrate unit test :)
[16:40:41] <m_gol> hah, interesting
[16:40:48] <m_gol> I didn't think about it
[16:41:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah i didn't either until it broke the test :)

[16:41:04] <doesallmagic2> Timmy Willison: Ajax: execute jQuery#load callback with correct context
[16:41:40] <DaveMethvin> let me open a ticket 
[16:42:39] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: do you know about any quirks related to wheel & mousewheel events auto-preventing each other?
[16:42:51] <m_gol> this is really weird: http://jsbin.com/vifego/edit?html,js,output
[16:42:57] <m_gol> try in Chrome or Safari
[16:43:07] <DaveMethvin> it's been a while since i did anything with wheel events
[16:43:16] <m_gol> if you comment out the part related to the `a` element the second one starts firing
[16:43:48] <m_gol> somehow just attaching a wheel handler to document prevents the mousewheel one from running O_o
[16:43:57] <m_gol> unless I don't see something obvious
[16:45:56] <DaveMethvin> it fires both in ie11, none in edge, and chrome/ff behave the same as you described
[16:46:11] <DaveMethvin> #youmightnotneedjquery
[16:46:17] <m_gol> ff doesn't have mousewheel afaik
[16:46:23] <m_gol> so the second one should never work 
[16:46:43] <DaveMethvin> yep you're right
[16:47:03] <m_gol> this must be some really old code if both Safari & Chrome have the quirk
[16:47:22] <DaveMethvin> i guess they figure if you listen for one you don't want the other
[16:47:54] <DaveMethvin> but i don't know any other event that works like that
[16:48:05] <DaveMethvin> touch of course but its rules are crazier
[16:48:59] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin opened issue #3040: Async ready event may let window.onload run before it 02https://git.io/vVESJ
[16:49:04] <m_gol> I wanted to check if mousewheel has the same bug
[16:49:12] <m_gol> & I discovered a new bug in the process
[16:49:14] <m_gol> fun fun
[16:49:25] <DaveMethvin> STOP MAKING BUGS
[16:53:34] <m_gol> I can't help myself :-)
[16:53:56] <DaveMethvin> we need to stop making unit tests, this happens every time

[16:57:24] <doesallmagic2> Timmy Willison: Ajax: execute jQuery#load callback with correct context
[16:59:02] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: Edge behaves like Chrome/Safari here...
[16:59:26] <DaveMethvin> i couldn't get the jsbin to work at all
[16:59:39] <m_gol> https://crbug.com/600501
[17:00:27] <m_gol> I hope it's not just Edge faithfully implementing Chrome bugs :D
[17:01:03] <DaveMethvin> i can understand them taking mousewheel out completely since wheel is the std one
[17:01:14] <DaveMethvin> but this is strange
