[06:39:23] <m_gol> Krinkle_ Krinkle: is this possible to get an id of a BrowserStack job for the specific TestSwarm test result?
[06:39:57] <m_gol> we're getting frequent failures on Android 2.3 & 4.3 (amazingly enough, 4.0-4.2 are fine) and they asked for specific builds so that they can debug
[06:40:10] <m_gol> but I have no idea how to get from http://swarm.jquery.org/job/806 to the respective jobs...
[06:40:16] <m_gol> Krinkle Krinkle_ ^^^
[10:11:09] <Krinkle> m_gol: Wait, what?
[10:11:30] <Krinkle> m_gol: You mean the browserstack worker?
[10:11:43] <m_gol> I'd like to connect specific test failures with specific BrowserStack runs
[10:12:01] <Krinkle> TestSwarm only has the user-agent (and potentially its IP)
[10:12:10] <Krinkle> check testswarm-browserstack instead.
[10:12:14] <m_gol> i.e. Android 2.3 timeout on ajax in build this & that -> https://www.browserstack.com/automate/builds/BUILD_NUMBER
[10:12:16] <Krinkle> Although it won't contain the relation
[10:12:27] <Krinkle> but it should contain all the worker IDs
[10:12:37] <Krinkle> I don't know about browserstack "build" or "job numbers.
[10:12:41] <Krinkle> That's not exposed anywhere afaik.
[10:12:45] <Krinkle> on their side.
[10:13:03] <Krinkle> so testswarm-browserstack.log on swarm-01 will show the browserstack worker IDs
[10:13:15] <Krinkle> which, if you control the experiment, should give you only one in a given timeframe.
[10:13:30] <m_gol> setting the job name to contain more details would work as well
[10:16:03] <m_gol> I mean, to have BrowserStack job name to contain the TestSwarm job number, browser (this one it does already) and the module tested in the name
[10:16:53] <m_gol> otherwise in the test there are ~20 tries so I have no way of knowing which BrowserStack run represents which module
[10:19:23] <m_gol> currently the name is just "Android Browser, android 2.3" which doesn't say a lot
