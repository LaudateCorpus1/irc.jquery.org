[09:18:08] <ryanneufeld> who do we know that works for Yandex?
[09:18:27] <ryanneufeld> someone on the team does, I just can't remember his name :S

[09:41:49] <jqcommit> [13jquery-release] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #29: CDN: Full control over tags 02http://git.io/xn0fGw
[09:53:19] <m_gol> anyone else has an impression webkit bugtracker looks like a ghost town recently? :/
[09:54:04] <paul_irish> they primarily work through radar, so at this point its really up to like intel/adobe/samsung to show activity
[09:54:15] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15baloneysandwiches opened issue #420: getScript docs have a possibly misleading warning about success resolving before execution 02http://git.io/ZaGH8w
[09:54:22] <m_gol> ah, that explains a lot
[09:54:35] <m_gol> it kinda sucks, though
[09:54:59] <m_gol> I guess that's still better than talking to "Microsoft Internet Explorer team" on the IE bugtracker
[09:55:20] <m_gol> or not hearing about submitted bugs at all like in Opera case
[09:55:34] <paul_irish> We have reviewed your issue and have concluded that it is not an issue. Thank you for using Connect!
[09:55:42] <m_gol> sth like that :)
[09:56:22] <m_gol> at least in Opera case engine-related bugs can be reported to crbug.com ;)
[09:56:40] <m_gol> they use the most open bug tracker and the most closed one at the same time :D
[09:58:11] <m_gol> radar-tracked bugs should still have that reflected in one linking comment on bugs.webkit.org, though, right?

[10:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> Well, whatever required jquery-migrate no longer exists on our sites.
[10:33:16] <scott_gonzalez> But since then, jquerymobile.com was added and their download builder uses .attr() for booleans.
[10:33:24] <scott_gonzalez> So I'll fix that and remove migrate from our sties.

[11:02:09] <gnarf> why is chrome 31 failing animate?
[11:03:02] <gnarf> effects: animate table-cell width/height
[11:03:15] <gnarf> seems like a weird fail
[11:05:52] <markelog> it is, fine on my machine

[13:26:30] <DaveMethvin> markelog, what was it?
[13:28:18] <m_gol> markelog: but did you check with Chrome 31? Current one is 32
[14:41:11] <markelog> DaveMethvin, m_gol: this is probably https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=290399
[14:41:42] <markelog> which was introduced in 30 beta, was fixed in 30, but went out to 31
[14:43:30] <m_gol> ...and then was fixed in 31 but BrowserStack doesn't update stable browsers, I guess
[14:43:49] <m_gol> since it works in 32 we may want to just skip that test in 31
[14:44:42] <markelog> where did you read this?
[14:45:10] <markelog> from the discussion in the tracker it looks like it wasn't fixed in 31
[14:45:19] <m_gol> https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=290399#c59
[14:45:35] <m_gol> but ok, that's only a comment
[14:45:37] <m_gol> no guarantees
[14:46:22] <m_gol> as for 32, see: http://omahaproxy.appspot.com/
[14:46:30] <m_gol> base_webkit_revision column
[14:47:03] <m_gol> and https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=290399#c49 says it was fixed in revision 159046
[14:47:31] <m_gol> we already blacklist the ajax in onbeforeunload test in Chrome 31, we can also blacklist this one
[14:47:52] <m_gol> add that to the serif-fonts problem... Chrome 31 wasn't exactly the best release
[14:48:57] <markelog> i'm not sure what i suppose to see in both links you provided
[14:49:00] <markelog> but anyway
[14:49:30] <markelog> skipping it was what proposed initially
[14:49:40] <markelog> *what i proposed
[14:50:30] <m_gol> base_webkit_revision column shows where the particular version branched from canary
[14:50:41] <markelog> no, i got that
[14:50:42] <m_gol> so if it's higher than when then fixed it, it should be fine
[14:51:19] <m_gol> so I don't get what you meant :)
[14:51:40] <markelog> don't bother :-), i'm a bit tired right know, can't hear my own thoughts
[14:51:48] <m_gol> ;)
[14:51:52] <markelog> i know it's fixed in 32
[14:51:56] <markelog> and it's not in 31
[14:51:58] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: IE11 doesn't cooperate :/ http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2378
[14:52:47] <markelog> we know how to fix it, only question if we should push that commit or not
[14:53:02] <markelog> or release it as is
[14:53:15] <m_gol> if it's fixed in 32 I don't think it's worth fixing it
[14:53:22] <m_gol> Chrome updates extremely fast
[14:53:33] <paul_irish> hi
[14:53:52] <m_gol> paul_irish: haha, mention Chrome and who comes out ;)
[14:53:55] <markelog> well not in the actual code of course
[14:53:59] <paul_irish> within 5 days basically nobody has 31 anymore.
[14:54:19] <markelog> i'm meant if should skip it or not
[14:54:41] <markelog> the test that is
[14:54:54] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core 1.x build #357: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%201.x/357/
[14:55:11] <m_gol> I'm for skipping it for 31, better to not see failures that we know of and that we accept
[14:55:33] <m_gol> otherwise it's harder to pay attention to "real" bugs
[14:55:52] <markelog> well if new version of chrome will be released in five days, i'm not sure if should bother
[14:56:09] <m_gol> markelog: Chrome 32 was already released
[14:56:22] <paul_irish> ^
[14:56:25] <m_gol> a week ago
[14:56:27] <paul_irish> last week
[14:56:48] <m_gol> so already almost no one should be on 31 ;)
[14:57:00] <markelog> oh, i thought you guys meant 34 will be released in 5 days
[14:57:30] <m_gol> no, that's closer to 5 weeks :P
[14:57:45] <markelog> okay, i'm clearly should go to bed
