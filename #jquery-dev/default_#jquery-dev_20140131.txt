[08:23:16] <m_gol> markelog: so, apparently Sauce Labs is OK with making Angular key public in the repo until Sauce Labs resolve the issue with Travis
[08:23:27] <m_gol> the BrowserStack key was removed
[08:25:05] <snover> m_gol: do you have a reference to this issue?
[08:25:40] <m_gol> snover: the BrowserStack issue is here: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/issues/5596
[08:26:01] <m_gol> as for Sauce Labs, there is no issue, I just got told by Igor Minar that's what they agreed with Sauce Labs to
[08:26:28] <markelog> m_gol: cool! Does it mean anyone could use that key now?
[08:26:36] <snover> oh, you said Sauce Labs issue with Travis
[08:26:58] <m_gol> markelog: they'll want to reset the key if they discover someone is abusing it
[08:27:03] <m_gol> but apparently no one is at the moment
[08:27:16] <m_gol> besides, it's a temporary solution from what I've heard
[08:27:27] <markelog> i would abuse it the hell out of this thing )
[08:27:40] <snover> Intern has been doing this since forever
[08:27:53] <snover> There‚Äôs very little incentive to use someone else‚Äôs key when you can get a free one

[08:29:50] <markelog> hm, if that the way it's going, we could do https://github.com/karma-runner/karma-sauce-launcher
[08:30:01] <markelog> instead of browserstack
[08:30:04] <m_gol> yup
[08:30:10] <markelog> although we wouldn't have mobile browsers
[08:31:10] <markelog> but i'm not sure if exposing private data is okay , since jquery a bit more popular then angular
[08:31:36] <markelog> DaveMethvin: thoughts?
[08:32:03] <snover> might as well switch to intern while you are at it ;)
[08:32:35] <markelog> but on the other hand
[08:32:39] <markelog> we could use sauce labs for PR's and browserstack for master and 1.x-master
[08:32:58] <markelog> but it will complicate things
[08:33:03] <markelog> snover: i will check it out
[08:33:51] <m_gol> markelog: why wouldn't we have mobile browsers? https://saucelabs.com/platforms

[08:38:30] <rapphyyy> Hello everyone, I create a infinite scroll and I want to retrieve the id of the last element, but does not happen.?
[08:38:38] <rapphyyy> please
[08:39:09] <markelog> i wonder why SauceLabs needs some credentials at all, if, apparently, anyone could use anyones keys
[08:39:42] <snover> it‚Äôs not a free service for non-oss users
[08:40:06] <snover> we‚Äôd never share our paid keys

[08:41:13] <markelog> snover: what would stop "me" to use intern keys for some private project?
[08:41:44] <snover> nothing, though we could revoke the access key
[08:42:03] <markelog> and then i would use your new one

[08:43:05] <rapphyyy> I will explain in fact I create a template with mustache.js and I recovered the data in JSON ajax, and I injected in my mustache template. 
[08:43:25] <markelog> sooner or later someone will abuse it, that's bad move even for temporary solution
[08:43:25] <DaveMethvin> rapphyyy: Go to #jquery please
[08:43:31] <rapphyyy> 1. the first recovery is ok, but when the scroll is down, he can not recover my last id here is my code.   1.The template mustache.js
[08:43:52] <DaveMethvin> catching up on the discussion
[08:44:09] <rapphyyy> this my code 
[08:44:11] <rapphyyy> https://gist.github.com/raphdev-eic/8734968
[08:44:19] <snover> sheesh
[08:44:20] <snover> some people
[08:44:37] <DaveMethvin> it's always seemed bad that sauce exposed keys 
[08:44:53] <DaveMethvin> but the setup doesn't reallly have a way to hide them i guess
[08:44:56] <snover> i gave the travis people some suggestions
[08:45:03] <snover> basically, disallow PRs changing .travis.yml
[08:45:13] <snover> then you can enforce removing the keys from process.env yourself
[08:45:20] <snover> and there is no leak
[08:45:47] <snover> well, i guess i should say, ‚Äúfrom the environment‚Äù
[08:45:55] <DaveMethvin> i suppose it will be low prio until someone abuses it badly enough
[08:46:23] <raphhyy> https://gist.github.com/raphdev-eic/8734968
[08:46:32] <DaveMethvin> oh raphhyy please go
[08:46:43] <markelog> DaveMethvin: i get the hint, it would be my project for the weekends!

[08:47:28] <raphhyy> ok
[08:48:02] <DaveMethvin> i just want something that WORKS RELIABLY for testing, but know it's a hard thing to do across lots of browsers
[08:48:47] <markelog> i think we should do private vars for now, when travis will fix it, it would fix the stuff on our side too
[08:49:48] <DaveMethvin> works for me
[08:50:56] <_markelog> and i can try it on the qunit first
[08:51:23] <_markelog> maybe there is some stuff that we can share among the projects
[08:51:30] <_markelog> like jzaefferer said
[08:56:27] <m_gol> though private will mean no testing for PRs
[08:56:45] <m_gol> the sizzle way won't work for us since we won't be passing tests on old Firefox & on PhantomJS
[08:57:13] <m_gol> well, we can always change it later

[09:13:15] <DaveMethvin> but really it's in a Google Spreadsheet
[09:13:43] <snover> i‚Äôm just looking for someone. i note the sign form says that the information will be public.
[09:14:15] <DaveMethvin> well, a subset of the info ... we used to collect more so it's not suitable for public linking right now
[09:14:24] <DaveMethvin> the info that is public shoudl be in the repo
[09:14:26] <DaveMethvin> name and email
[09:15:00] <_markelog> mzgol: it's more like safari 5.1 actually
[09:15:54] <_markelog> but phantom shouldn't be judged by it's ua string

[18:23:37] <Krinkle> markelog: Unless somehow is going to spend (imho waste) time developing a testswarm-saucelabs deamon (like testswarm-browserstack), we're sticking with browserstack while we use TestSwarm from Jenkins. When we switch to fully command-line grunt-wrapped crossbrowser testing from Travis we can use whatever as long as there is a package for it and it works from Travis/Jenkins/local dev with at most some env 
[18:23:37] <Krinkle> params set.
