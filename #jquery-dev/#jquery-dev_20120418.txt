[05:40:06] <gibson042> .
[06:43:41] <gnarf> hey gibson042
[06:43:52] <gnarf> thanks for all the work on that
[06:43:55] <gibson042> hey there
[06:44:03] <gibson042> no problem
[06:44:56] <gibson042> I think I've got one last changeset to send over, but after that it'd probably take deeper knowledge to get much more
[06:48:27] <gnarf> if you give me one sec - if you could rebase off of what I'm about to push that would rock
[06:49:24] <gnarf> hrm
[06:50:57] <gnarf> darn gzip
[06:51:11] <gibson042> yeah, it's killer
[06:51:12] <gnarf> thought i saw one, but it was -1 min, +3 gz ;)
[07:00:03] <gnarf> gibson042: just pushed
[07:43:57] <rwaldron> gibson042 nice work on trimming down effects
[07:44:14] <rwaldron> gnarf and gibson042 nice work to both of you for making that happen
[07:45:05] <gibson042> thanks
[07:45:11] <gibson042> 10 more to go, then I think that's it
[07:45:59] <rwaldron> 10 more bytes?
[07:46:02] <rwaldron> you can do it.
[07:46:09] <rwaldron> My money is on 11
[07:46:17] <rwaldron> I predict that you'll remove 11
[08:20:29] <ralphholzmann> OH MAN
[08:20:35] <ralphholzmann> is there a push to make jquery smaller?
[08:20:38] <ralphholzmann> :)
[08:24:51] <gnarf> gibson042: i didn't make the regexp change btw
[08:25:01] <gibson042> no problem; I'll get that
[08:25:03] <gnarf> gibson042: if you don't mind throwing that in your branch if you're working on more
[08:25:15] <gibson042> how did you pull in my changesets directly?
[08:25:18] <gnarf> did you rebase to my branch so i can just FF merge it next time? :)
[08:25:24] <gnarf> gibson042: git cherry-pick
[08:25:34] <gnarf> i tried to do a fast forward merge - but...
[08:26:36] <gibson042> will rebase work after commits are live on github? I read somewhere that it was a Bad Idea
[08:33:02] <gnarf> gibson042: so here's the thing
[08:33:08] <gnarf> its a bad idea if someone else is based on you
[08:33:27] <gnarf> but its safe enough if its just your feature branch and its getting merged anyway
[08:33:41] <gibson042> which is precisely our case here
[08:33:57] <gnarf> so you could git fetch gnarf ; git reset --hard gnarf/1.8-effects
[08:34:08] <gnarf> and your 1.8-effects branch would then === mine
[08:34:20] <gnarf> or you can git pull --rebase gnarf 1.8-effects
[08:34:25] <gnarf> and deal with the merges
[08:34:28] <gnarf> if they happen
[08:34:41] <gnarf> but either way, when you go to push it up you will have to push -f
[08:34:52] <gnarf> gibson042: in general I don't care about push -f on my personal repo
[08:35:17] <gnarf> noone should be working based on one of my fork branches anyway - but if i were to push a 1.8-effects you could no longer merge with it
[08:35:27] <gnarf> or use it with pull
[08:35:35] <gnarf> because its not "fast-forward" from the commits that you have
[08:35:40] <gibson042> got it
[08:46:07] <rwaldron> jzaefferer yt?
[08:46:19] <rwaldron> or even danheberden?
[08:58:01] <gibson042> -13!
[09:03:09] <rwaldron> NIIIIICE
[09:03:18] <rwaldron> that's 2 more then I predicted. which was awesome.
[09:03:20] <rwaldron> is*
[09:03:22] <rwaldron> ack
[09:03:24] <rwaldron> nice one dude
[09:04:29] <gibson042> assuming they pass muster, we're at +182 for effects changes
[09:05:14] <gibson042> with enough hook points to use transitions in favor of manual ticks, I think that works
[09:06:39] <gibson042> and we can strip 40 more by optimizing deferred.js, but I don't know where that stands given conflicts with the CCAO work
[09:21:08] <gibson042> and 75 more by eliminating cross-file redundancy in build ;)
[09:28:42] <gnarf> gibson042: put em together in pulls
[09:37:36] <rwaldron> gibson042 ignore CCAO
[09:37:57] <rwaldron> and great work to both of you

[09:45:48] <DaveMethvin> hai!
[09:45:55] <rwaldron> Mind if I land no-body?
[09:45:59] <rwaldron> I want to try out pulley
[09:46:08] <DaveMethvin> oh sure
[09:46:10] <rwaldron> which i just updated to sindresorhus and mikesherov's latest
[09:46:17] <rwaldron> cool.
[09:46:30] <sindresorhus> rwaldron: :D
[09:46:45] <rwaldron> here goes
[09:47:36] <rwaldron> ugh

[09:47:44] <rwaldron> is pulley hardcoded to master?

[09:48:02] <rwaldron> i ran it from my 1.8pre branch

[09:48:11] <rwaldron> shit.

[09:49:01] <rwaldron> sindresorhus, i have "current branch" code
[09:49:09] <rwaldron> a grunt helper i wrote for jQuery
[09:49:38] <sindresorhus> rwaldron: Can you add it to the issue? :)
[09:49:46] <sindresorhus> a link
[09:49:58] <rwaldron> yes
[09:50:07] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin give me a sec to fix this
[09:50:41] <DaveMethvin> just reset back to the prev commit and push
[09:52:52] <DaveMethvin> i had my ghetto push preventer in place there .... master had a simple typo fix that I haven't put into 1.8pre
[09:53:03] <DaveMethvin> so if i type "git push jquery master" it would tell me no
[09:54:12] <gnarf> its a single commit
[09:54:14] <gnarf> since its on master
[09:54:39] <gnarf> git checkout master ; git revert 532ba25 ; git push jquery master
[09:55:05] <gnarf> git checkout 1.8-pre ; git cherry-pick 532ba25 ; git push jquery 1.8pre
[09:55:22] <gnarf> rwaldron: ^^^^
[09:55:39] <DaveMethvin> sindresorhus: can you change pulley so it uses gh-741? that avoids confusion with track ticket numbers
[09:55:47] <DaveMethvin> trac
[09:55:59] <DaveMethvin> i'mm make a ticket on pulley
[09:56:08] <sindresorhus> DaveMethvin: You do that :)

[09:57:02] <gnarf> JENKINS IS MAD AT YOU
[09:57:04] <nacin> gnarf: I was about to say, go rwaldron.
[09:57:13] <rwaldron> So...
[09:57:19] <rwaldron> I blame pulley.
[09:57:23] <gnarf> rwaldron: me too
[09:57:25] <rwaldron> thank-you-very-much
[09:57:33] <gnarf> rwaldron: use git merge --squash next time
[09:57:37] <rwaldron> If I had done that with my mitts, this wouldnt be an issue
[09:57:49] <gnarf> rwaldron: pulley sucks ;)
[09:58:13] <sindresorhus> rwaldron:  Sorry, though it shouldn't commit, when I experienced it it only asked me to solve a really big merge conflict.
[09:58:14] <gnarf> </sarcasm> in case the ;) didn't signify
[09:58:29] <sindresorhus> rwaldron: Here is how you do it manually btw: https://github.com/jeresig/pulley/issues/41
[09:58:30] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #41 on pulley (mikesherov; 2d, 20h ago): pulley assumes the destination branch is always master!
[10:00:28] <DaveMethvin> although gnarf i have definitely understood git better by doing it manually
[10:00:47] <DaveMethvin> and it's harder to screw things up on a grand scale like you can with a script that does 20 steps
[10:00:53] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: its not that hard, really
[10:00:55] <gnarf> right
[10:01:01] <gnarf> i just feel safer doing that by hand
[10:01:12] <gnarf> because i know better than my automation does
[10:01:33] <sindresorhus> but automation is a lot faster
[10:01:42] <DaveMethvin> faster both good and bad
[10:01:57] <sindresorhus> "Automate the shit you know"
[10:02:03] <DaveMethvin> like, OMG I am headed for a brick wall!
[10:02:19] <DaveMethvin> "I wish i could go faster and get it over with!" :P
[10:03:01] <DaveMethvin> i think it's just a case of getting the settings right, for example john used jquery/master as his origin which i don't have the balls to do
[10:03:24] <DaveMethvin> and the other release scripts do the same atm
[10:03:50] <DaveMethvin> but my origin is dmethvin so I always do a manual step to push to jquery
[10:04:04] <sindresorhus> DaveMethvin:  That's smart
[10:04:07] <DaveMethvin> that prevents me from hosing jquery, at worst i just hose my branch
[10:04:23] <DaveMethvin> which makes pulley a bit safer

[10:06:20] <rwaldron> shut up jenkins
[10:06:33] <DaveMethvin> lol you tell em rwaldron
[10:07:27] <DaveMethvin> oh i forgot an issue with backing out commits ... we may need to have danheberden do some sort of manual re-pull to get the jquery-git job working right again
[10:07:39] <DaveMethvin> at least it seemed to choke last time we did something like this
[10:07:44] <rwaldron> gibson042 can you change the PR branch to 1.8pre?
[10:07:53] <danheberden> DaveMethvin i thought i fixed that, but lemme know if  the sha on jquery-git.js is different
[10:08:09] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/742
[10:08:11] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by gibson042 (5m, 13s ago): Optimizations in deferred.js
[10:08:13] <rwaldron> gibson042 ^^
[10:08:43] <rwaldron> you made the request against "jquery:master", needs to be "jquery:1.8pre"
[10:08:46] <rwaldron> thanks!
[10:10:00] <DaveMethvin> holy crap, another coupla weeks and gibson042 will have jquery down to (function(){ /*copyright*/ })();
[10:10:48] <sindresorhus> haha, gibson042, you're awesome!
[10:11:00] <gibson042> to be fair, this one was originally proposed 4 months ago and was only given a refresher
[10:11:48] <gnarf> rwaldron: did you push the revert commit on master ?
[10:12:26] <gnarf> oo, did you push -f it away?
[10:12:35] <gnarf> i generally try to avoid doing that
[10:12:47] <gnarf> because it can cause problems being a "non-fast forward" on pulls
[10:13:28] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: even if nobody pulled against it?
[10:13:35] <DaveMethvin> cause i've done that before, rarely
[10:13:55] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so like there is always view.jquery.com right?
[10:14:00] <gnarf> it pulls everything
[10:14:15] <DaveMethvin> well and jquery-git seems to have pulled it as well :(
[10:14:18] <gnarf> i try to not push non-fast-forward on the "origin" branch
[10:14:33] <gnarf> and then if those things get "stuck" it requires a manual poke to update them
[10:14:42] <DaveMethvin> so danheberden the current jquery-git has the commit that rwaldron just reverted
[10:14:50] <gnarf> so even though its ugly, and evidence of the mess up, its better to revert the commit
[10:14:56] <DaveMethvin> um push -f ed
[10:15:07] <gnarf> i can fix it
[10:15:09] <gnarf> or tell you how to
[10:15:13] <gnarf> so it should fast forward again
[10:15:32] <DaveMethvin> fire away, i can stand to learn somethign today
[10:15:36] <DaveMethvin> :P
[10:15:36] <gnarf> you need to git fetch origin ; git checkout master ; git reset --hard 532ba25 ; git revert 532ba25 ; git push
[10:15:50] <gnarf> so you take your head and set it to 532ba25 then revert 532ba25 and push
[10:16:06] <gnarf> and then the world can fast forward again
[10:17:14] <DaveMethvin> oic, MY commit
[10:17:58] <danheberden> the repo is up-to-date on the git build?
[10:18:05] * danheberden is slightly confused what's going on
[10:18:20] <gnarf> danheberden: i think the git builder uses reset --hard origin/master
[10:18:21] <gnarf> doesn't it?
[10:18:30] <danheberden> it should
[10:18:40] <gnarf> which is immune to the push -f issue
[10:18:44] <gnarf> but not everything is
[10:19:01] <gnarf> 6 of one - half dozen of the other
[10:19:22] <danheberden> the only way i've had it fullproof is to git checkout  $(cat .git/refs/heads/master) or whatever
[10:19:55] <danheberden> but the reset is basically the same thing
[10:20:06] <gnarf> but something as popular as jquery:master - you don't know how many people have pulled in that 5 minutes 532ba25 was head
[10:21:09] <gnarf> danheberden: git fetch origin ; git checkout origin/master ; git clean -dfx ; git submodule init ; git submodule update --- should handle it
[10:21:54] <danheberden> done
[10:22:04] <gnarf> test it once
[10:22:11] <gnarf> but i think that should work every time
[10:22:15] <gnarf> in all situations
[10:22:25] <danheberden> head is at 376e0d9
[10:22:48] <gnarf> yup
[10:22:56] <gnarf> thats origin/master
[10:23:17] <gnarf> thats in "no branch" mode
[10:23:30] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: where are you seeing 532ba25?
[10:23:54] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: its not on master right now
[10:24:00] <DaveMethvin> yeah i know
[10:24:02] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: rick made it disappear
[10:24:10] <DaveMethvin> and my git has no idea where it is to be able to put it back
[10:24:30] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: did you git fetch jquery ?
[10:24:39] <DaveMethvin> yes just now
[10:25:01] <gnarf> now can you git show 532ba25
[10:25:02] <gnarf> ?
[10:25:35] <gnarf> nope
[10:25:36] <gnarf> darn
[10:25:39] <DaveMethvin> fatal: ambiguous argument '532ba25': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.
[10:25:40] <gnarf> its gone!
[10:25:56] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits/532ba25
[10:26:04] <gnarf> its on ricks local
[10:26:19] <DaveMethvin> well then he can put it back
[10:26:20] <gnarf> but apparently git fetch isn't delivering that orphaned commit
[10:26:22] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah sure
[10:26:30] <DaveMethvin> it's clearly on his local box
[10:27:09] <DaveMethvin> here i go, learning more
[10:28:45] <gnarf> so i guess rwaldron needs to do the git checkout master ; git reset --hard 532ba25 ; git revert 532ba25 ; git push -- if we want to bother
[10:29:19] <DaveMethvin> well since you made us feel all guilty about it :)
[10:29:29] * gnarf shrugs
[10:29:30] <DaveMethvin> i definitely see your point
[10:29:43] <gnarf> there is a reason they stop you from doing it without a -f
[10:29:46] <DaveMethvin> even the project itself has a few things that pull constantly against it
[10:30:06] <gnarf> i mean, on a gnarf37/1.8-effects branch i don't mind doing a -f push
[10:30:18] <gnarf> but on jquery/ it should always be fast-forward
[10:30:34] <DaveMethvin> and like i said, I committed that small typo correction against master just so i wouldn't accidentally push jquery 1.8pre on it
[10:30:40] <gnarf> my $0.02
[10:30:54] <DaveMethvin> because i do shit like that ... well my fingers do sometimes
[10:31:35] <danheberden> that's what...
[10:31:40] <DaveMethvin> ss
[10:31:42] <gnarf> ?ts @DaveMethvin
[10:31:43] <bot-t1> DaveMethvin, That's Sexualâ„¢
[10:32:15] <DaveMethvin> well rwaldron wanted to test pulley, i guess he did! :D
[10:32:21] * gnarf laughs
[10:39:49] <rwaldron> ugh, what did I do wrong?
[10:40:06] <gnarf> rwaldron: nothing, but in principle, never push -f to jquery branches
[10:40:27] <gnarf> rwaldron: if someone is running an "auto pull" on the branch, when you do a non-ff it breaks
[10:40:39] <rwaldron> I guess... yeah, ok, you're right
[10:40:56] <gnarf> rwaldron: git checkout master ; git reset --hard 532ba25 ; git revert 532ba25 ; git push jquery master
[10:41:00] <rwaldron> now?
[10:41:10] <rwaldron> are you instructing me to do this?
[10:41:13] <gnarf> rwaldron: no reason not to - it puts everything back in its right place
[10:41:18] <rwaldron> ok
[10:41:23] <gnarf> you agree on that right?
[10:41:28] <rwaldron> always
[10:41:37] <gnarf> coo - then lets do it
[10:41:41] <rwaldron> i just didnt know what you were trying to communicate to me
[10:41:49] <gnarf> and by that i mean, you do it since you're the only one with 532ba25 on their machine ;)
[10:41:56] <rwaldron> next time, add...
[10:42:00] <gnarf> and github wont feed it to us
[10:42:03] <rwaldron> "please run this: ...."
[10:42:05] <rwaldron> ;)
[10:42:34] <rwaldron> um
[10:42:44] <gnarf> what didn't work?
[10:42:46] <rwaldron> wait
[10:42:47] <rwaldron> one sec
[10:42:58] <rwaldron> holy shit.
[10:43:00] <rwaldron> wtf.
[10:43:54] <rwaldron> something just went terribly wrong
[10:44:04] <gnarf> :/
[10:44:10] <gnarf> its all fixable
[10:44:23] <rwaldron> git revert 532ba25 just sploded everything
[10:44:36] <David_Souther> With enough --rebase, anything is fixable
[10:44:50] <gnarf> rwaldron: how so?
[10:45:23] <rwaldron> i have no idea
[10:45:31] <rwaldron> i dont know how to explain what happened
[10:45:35] <gnarf> screen share skype?
[10:45:36] <rwaldron> some shit with vimrc??
[10:45:59] <rwaldron> this is fuck
[10:46:02] <rwaldron> ackkkk
[10:46:03] <rwaldron> i cant
[10:46:08] <gnarf> so
[10:46:13] <rwaldron> one sec
[10:46:29] <rwaldron> I have not had this kind of bullshit trouble with git in like 2 years
[10:46:33] <gnarf> before you freak out, you can always git reset --hard 532ba25
[10:46:40] <gnarf> and it should unroll
[10:46:44] <gnarf> specially after git clean
[10:47:28] <rwaldron> yeah, it's fine when i do that

[10:54:29] <rwaldron> gnarf is basically my hero
[10:54:56] <gnarf> thanks for putting us back on fast-forwards rick!
[10:55:13] <rwaldron> well, no... thank you
[10:56:04] <DaveMethvin> "Any time the jQuery Team is in git trouble, they put out the gnarf-shaped signal light..."
[10:56:47] <DaveMethvin> OBTW, let's not use pulley until this is fixed: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/741
[11:04:23] <gnarf> hehe
[11:22:00] <kswedberg> whoa. that last commit looks crazy. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/532ba250a9f6c5b0f51ec53d68aef9fb148e8dd6
[11:22:01] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery by rwldrn (1h, 34m ago): Closes #741: Remove $("body") case in favor of $(document.body).

[11:25:08] <kswedberg> ah. ok. as long as someone is on it. it just kind of scared me.
[11:25:20] <kswedberg> aha!
[11:25:30] <kswedberg> thx, gnarf
[12:39:25] <jzaefferer> hey rwaldron, I hear you like destroying jQuery
[12:39:25] <bot-t1> (2 hours 58 mins ago) <rwaldron> tell jzaefferer ping me re: qunitjs.com, thanks!
[12:41:20] <rwaldron> jzaefferer ;P
[12:42:21] <DaveMethvin> ouch
[12:42:48] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron, when do you think we should land the grunt stuff?
[12:42:55] <jzaefferer> fun, irc works over this train-tethered single G connection, but nothing else does...
[12:49:51] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin have you upgraded your node.js?
[12:50:16] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[12:50:28] <DaveMethvin> well if I do that is the pull worth landing?
[12:50:32] <ajpiano> "Once my jQuery changes have been merged into the 1.8pre branch, I'll solicit testers from the closure-compiler users."
[12:50:41] <DaveMethvin> see my reply ajp
[12:50:52] <ajpiano> oh it just arrived
[12:51:01] <DaveMethvin> oh open it, open it!
[12:51:14] <DaveMethvin> it's like an amazon.com box, without the smiliey
[12:51:15] <ajpiano> nice
[12:51:47] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yes it definitely it
[12:51:48] <rwaldron> is*
[12:52:37] <rwaldron> ajpiano where is that?
[12:52:42] <ajpiano> your email
[12:53:42] <DaveMethvin> such is the power of ajpiano that he can read rwaldron's inbox
[12:55:55] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin, perhaps I'll land grunt branch
[12:56:02] <rwaldron> maybe I'll fuck it up less this time.
[12:56:11] <DaveMethvin> just don't pulley that sucka
[12:56:40] <DaveMethvin> really tbh i don't think pulley would save me that much, i used it in the past
[12:57:03] <rwaldron> ok, so.. In this scenario, what are the commands you'd use to merge this?
[12:57:16] <rwaldron> because obvouisly my day-to-day practice is not the same
[12:57:24] <DaveMethvin> right
[12:57:29] <DaveMethvin> i ran into that too
[12:57:36] <DaveMethvin> what i do on my own branches is very different
[12:57:39] <rwaldron> yeah
[12:57:46] <rwaldron> I like having complete history
[12:57:51] <rwaldron> squash is weird to me.
[12:57:52] <DaveMethvin> it took me a while to figure it out
[12:58:12] <DaveMethvin> so usually i checkout -b  12345 or whatever
[12:58:18] <rwaldron> yep
[12:58:26] <rwaldron> in this case, I already have the branch
[12:58:30] <rwaldron> so lets pretend I just did that
[12:58:37] <DaveMethvin> ok so checkout 1.8pre
[12:58:56] <rwaldron> hrm
[12:59:12] <rwaldron> ok, right...
[12:59:13] <rwaldron> duh
[12:59:18] <rwaldron> nothing different so far
[12:59:25] <DaveMethvin> then git merge --squash branchname
[12:59:49] <DaveMethvin> i used to use --no-commit but --squash doesn't commit i don't think
[13:00:08] <DaveMethvin> so if you do a git status at this point, what does it look like?
[13:00:18] <DaveMethvin> should have uncommmitted changes?
[13:00:19] <rwaldron> Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested
[13:00:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:00:53] <DaveMethvin> ok so git commit -a       normally you'd also need --author "oriinal author's name.email"
[13:00:58] <DaveMethvin> but in this case it's you
[13:01:05] <DaveMethvin> then edit the commit message
[13:01:23] <DaveMethvin> git log should show the new commit
[13:01:27] <rwaldron> ok
[13:01:30] <rwaldron> one sec
[13:01:55] <DaveMethvin> generally i end up messing with the log message a few times or maybe even the files, and git commit -a --amend until it's all pretty like
[13:02:30] <DaveMethvin> then a make, er, grunt to see whether it all still passes
[13:03:47] <DaveMethvin> I like the log message to read all nice without having to click the plus sign ... i really with github would give us a few more chars there
[13:04:48] <DaveMethvin> so when i'm ready I git push jquery 1.8pre
[13:05:09] <DaveMethvin> the reason i landed that typo change on master after branching is so that i don't accidentally push to master
[13:05:39] <DaveMethvin> because, like, i've already almost done it twice if git didn't stop me
[13:06:06] <DaveMethvin> i'm sure gnarf has some fancy way to do it but that worked for me
[13:08:02] <jqcommit> [jquery] rwldrn pushed 1 new commit to 1.8pre: http://git.io/iMdUmQ

[13:09:02] <jq-jenkins> waldron.rick: Initial grunt implementation
[13:09:14] <rwaldron> STFU.
[13:09:22] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I tihnk that went smoothly
[13:09:43] <rwaldron> not gonna lie, i practiced on a scratch branch twice before I used my actual 1.8pre
[13:10:24] <DaveMethvin> lol, yeah i feel your pain
[13:10:56] <DaveMethvin> ok so I'll pull that down and play with it, to see if there is a node for windows that will find it acceptable
[13:31:24] <jaubourg> plop
[13:34:21] <DaveMethvin> greetings jaubourg
[13:35:37] <jaubourg> hey DaveMethvin, how are you?
[13:35:38] <jaubourg> :)
[13:35:45] <DaveMethvin> pretty good
[13:35:52] <DaveMethvin> just bangin on 1.8
[13:36:07] <jaubourg> bangin being positive or negative?
[13:36:21] <DaveMethvin> well.... not decided yet :D
[13:36:26] <jaubourg> (saw the closure specific code, and my opinion still hasn't changed)
[13:36:34] <DaveMethvin> yep, i have my concerns
[13:36:50] <DaveMethvin> i hope we can get a stable branch against 1.8 that interested parties can try
[13:36:59] <DaveMethvin> if we do that we can see if they will hold up their end
[13:37:15] <DaveMethvin> i think there is a lot of "does all magic" thinking as if we can solve the CCAO issues
[13:37:21] <jaubourg> I wish I had time to check gnarf's animation rewrite but I'm knee-deep in work atm
[13:37:30] <DaveMethvin> but there is still a lot of heavy lifting that devs will have to do
[13:37:47] <DaveMethvin> and we haven't tried to make UI or Mobile CCAO-friendly ...
[13:37:54] * DaveMethvin laughs fiendishly
[13:38:08] <jaubourg> my opinion is still this: we sacrifice actual size gain for everyone to help a minority save a few bytes === not worth it imo
[13:38:38] <jaubourg> I see all the effort involved for an hypothetic "grand" gain
[13:39:07] <jaubourg> it's pretty sad to see the amount of work involved too
[13:39:20] <DaveMethvin> again it's down to scenarios ... i think for most "web pages" i isnt worth the trouble
[13:39:30] <jaubourg> that would have to be maintained throughout code changes and bug fixes
[13:39:39] <DaveMethvin> for that matter, most web sites don't think it's worth the trouble to combine and compress
[13:40:02] <DaveMethvin> i think it makes more sense if you are writing a 500kb js app
[13:40:21] <DaveMethvin> but only if jQuery, jQuery UI, your MVC framework, etc are CCAO friendly
[13:40:27] <DaveMethvin> otherwise it won't buy much
[13:41:00] <jaubourg> the amount of what if is getting a bit high for my taste :P
[13:41:05] <DaveMethvin> whoops, got some stuff for a 5pm deadline, brb
[13:41:11] <jaubourg> cya around Dave :)
[13:41:21] * jaubourg goes back to his php code
[13:42:04] * danheberden hugs jaubourg like a soldier going to the front lines
[13:42:57] <jaubourg> hehe
[13:43:02] <jaubourg> hi danheberden and thanks
[13:43:09] <danheberden> :)
[13:43:09] <jaubourg> I so need the courage
[13:43:21] <jaubourg> anyway, back to code
[13:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Votes? Or are you waiting till the morning?
[13:49:58] <DaveMethvin> we still have about half an hour
[13:50:14] <DaveMethvin> the second second arrived around 5:15 for most of them
[13:50:22] <scott_gonzalez> Oh man, that was late :-P
[13:50:38] <DaveMethvin> i'm typing them up and proofing now
[13:50:54] <DaveMethvin> of course i'll still leave at least one error in to make sure you're reading
[13:54:52] <scott_gonzalez> I can't start my vote until 6:00p, so I've got time to copy + fix yours :-P
[13:55:45] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: You should update your grunt branch to 0.3.9.
[13:56:06] <scott_gonzalez> I landed a fix for uglify to ensure that it includes a terminating semicolon at the end of the file.
[13:56:34] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently uglify only does that automatically if you use the binary. Using the node module directly leaves the semicolon out.
[13:57:15] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez will do
[13:58:01] <DaveMethvin> in case you guys need a semicolon, i'll leave an extra one here;
[13:58:14] * rwaldron put it somewhere in the code
[13:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks Dave. I'm starting to run out with my new coding style.
[14:00:10] <DaveMethvin> i think that uglify not putting a semicolon at the end of the file is kind of, well, dumb.

[14:02:13] <jq-jenkins> waldron.rick: Update grunt version to >=0.3.9
[14:02:21] <rwaldron> obviously
[14:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:02:57] <DaveMethvin> theres nothing failey about it YET http://swarm.jquery.org/job/50/
[14:03:09] <rwaldron> pfft
[14:03:25] <DaveMethvin> WOLF WOLF WOLF
[14:04:29] <rwaldron> this looks snazzy
[14:04:30] <rwaldron> http://www.chris-granger.com/images/lightable/game-example.png
[14:04:39] <rwaldron> but also kind of looks like what John is making
[14:04:46] <rwaldron> and what Uxebu is making
[14:04:56] <rwaldron> http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/306316578/light-table
[14:07:04] <DaveMethvin> since it's "share a link time" here is an interesting shim for setImmediate: http://jsperf.com/postmessage
[14:08:44] <rwaldron> I tihnk I read about that
[14:09:07] <rwaldron> oh right, Malte.. last summer
[14:09:09] <rwaldron> good stuff
[14:09:41] <rwaldron> actually, glad you shared that
[14:09:48] <rwaldron> uses blobs for workers
[14:09:56] <rwaldron> i needed some evidence of this
[15:07:47] <mikesherov> .
[15:09:49] <mikesherov> gnarf: so here's an interesting question, maybe. Why does effects.js clamp negative values to zero for width/height, but css.js considers it a no-op?
[15:09:59] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: maybe you can answer that?
[15:11:14] <DaveMethvin> well if an effect undershot without reaching 0 we'd want it to reach 0?
[15:12:12] <mikesherov> right, I guess on css though we want it to be a no-op
[15:12:26] <mikesherov> Makes sense I guess.
[15:12:31] <DaveMethvin> i guess css could consider it a 0
[15:12:40] <DaveMethvin> i am sure we'd get bug reports somehow
[15:12:48] <mikesherov> probably
[15:12:57] <mikesherov> I guess I'll just not make that change
[15:13:04] <DaveMethvin> "i asked for -5, didn't you know i was crazy?"
[15:13:11] <mikesherov> was trying to save some bytes for gnarf
[15:13:15] <gnarf> :P
[15:13:22] <DaveMethvin> well ...
[15:13:26] <DaveMethvin> how many bytes?
[15:13:36] <mikesherov> gnarf: I can save 12 bytes by moving the undershot checks to css
[15:14:00] <mikesherov> but that breaks two tests that expect undershots in css to be no-ops
[15:15:11] <DaveMethvin> it does seem nice to treat them the same
[15:15:35] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: btw, I'll have pulley sorted out so it can do merges into not master done tongiht
[15:15:43] <mikesherov> didn't know you were going to give it another shot :-P
[15:15:50] <mikesherov> yeah, I suppose
[15:15:54] <mikesherov> it would be nice
[15:16:10] <mikesherov> I just hate breaking any expectations, even if they are insane
[15:16:13] <DaveMethvin> i will prolly do it the old fashioned way for now
[15:16:38] <DaveMethvin> well mainly it's just whether anyone is passing negative widths and having them ignored
[15:16:49] <mikesherov> right, or set to zero
[15:16:56] <DaveMethvin> like .width(20).width(-10) and expecting 20
[15:17:10] <DaveMethvin> i mean, they SHOULD'NT
[15:17:14] <mikesherov> right
[15:17:26] <mikesherov> i can imagine an insane person doing that
[15:17:36] <DaveMethvin> so if it makes the code cleaner i'd be up for it
[15:18:25] <mikesherov> well, it takes the responsibility off of effects for that
[15:18:35] <rwaldron> insane people do insane things
[15:18:37] <mikesherov> brb
[15:21:09] <mikesherov_> Yeah. I can imagine someone crazy testing for negative numbers by seeing if .width is a no-op
[15:21:48] <mikesherov_> But do we want to support mr crazy pants?
[15:23:17] <DaveMethvin> no crazy pants
[15:26:09] <mikesherov> K. My change might be non-performant so it may be for naught. Just wanted to make sure before I broke back compat. Thanks for the help.
[15:29:34] <gnarf> there are unit tests testing the no-op in css?
[15:29:39] <gnarf> do they have a ticket associated?
[15:29:46] <gnarf> can you blame them and find the reason they were created?
[15:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> mikesherov: The createWithFriesXML() function in the tests was definitely in use while wycats and I were refactoring the tests. You should ping wycats to confirm that all of the changes were committed.
[15:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> It's also possible that we removed the need to use it by the end.
[15:53:49] <jaubourg> mikesherov, DaveMethvin: +1 on having .width( -15 ) zeroing the width
[15:54:06] <jaubourg> and now I'm getting back to php :'(
[15:58:25] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, mikesherov, jaubourg: the source of the "ignore width" behavior is http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1599 ... we'll have to decide whether to change it
[15:58:54] <DaveMethvin> ?tell  mikesherov the source of the "ignore width" behavior is http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1599 ... we'll have to decide whether to change it
[15:58:55] <bot-t1> DaveMethvin, Okay.
[16:08:53] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: hrm
[16:09:51] <DaveMethvin> i dunno gnarf, seems like it was sort of arbitrary
[16:10:07] <DaveMethvin> it really is outside valid inputs
[16:10:36] <DaveMethvin> we're still not throwing an error, which was the complaint about ie in 1599
[16:16:48] <gnarf> right
[16:16:58] <gnarf> at the same time, the native dom ignores it
[16:17:19] <gnarf> we could perhaps decide that the user MEANT to set it to something very small aka 0
[16:20:51] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: perhaps we should create a ticket
[16:21:09] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: just to have a persistent discussion area
[16:21:24] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: solicit opinions?
[16:21:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah, seems like it's worth discussion
[16:22:09] <DaveMethvin> you just KNOW there is no way we'll figure out if it breaks anything until we ship
[16:22:36] <DaveMethvin> but it seems like it would be hard to depend on negative numbers as a no-op
[16:23:10] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: agreed
[16:23:25] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you wanna make the ticket?
[16:23:31] <DaveMethvin> sure
[18:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin, gnarf: .animate() already treats negative values as 0.
[18:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> For width and height.
[18:14:30] <DaveMethvin> yes it does but csss does not
[18:14:34] <DaveMethvin> did i say that wrong?
[18:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> No, I only read the last few lines of the discussion.
[18:14:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah we're tryna get it consistent
[18:15:09] <DaveMethvin> but are fearing that someone will use .width(-2) as a nop
[18:15:10] <scott_gonzalez> I was just pointing out that changing .css() to Math.max( val, 0 ) would be consistent with .aniamte()
[18:15:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah which is what we want to do
[18:15:29] <DaveMethvin> but just tryna think of code we might break
[18:16:05] <DaveMethvin> like   .width(47).width(-3).width() returns 47
[18:16:09] <DaveMethvin> not 0
[18:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> seems ghetto
[18:16:37] <DaveMethvin> "oh," said Scott, "there can't possibly be ANY code that ANYONE would write to do that"
[18:17:14] <DaveMethvin> flash forward to July and some major plugin will file a bug the day after 1.8 releases, "YOU HAZ BORKED MAH CODE"
[18:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> Seems better than what we just did in UI, which was releasing with jQuery.ui.version = "@VERSION" :-(
[18:18:39] <DaveMethvin> i think that release needed more semicolon
[18:18:53] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it actually did need more.
[18:19:00] <DaveMethvin> yah
[18:19:08] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8257
[18:19:40] <DaveMethvin> i  think the uglify guys are being kind of short sighted by not putting one in
[18:19:59] <scott_gonzalez> They do it in the binary, but not in the node module.
[18:20:03] <scott_gonzalez> Pretty annoying.
[18:20:30] <DaveMethvin> pretty inconsistent
[18:20:31] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing `+ ';'` in grunt couldn't solve :-)
[18:20:52] <DaveMethvin> once you find out, sure
[18:21:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, ben_alman let me land it in grunt though, so nobody else has to suffer.
[19:35:35] <mikesherov> .
[19:35:36] <bot-t1> (3 hours 36 mins ago) <DaveMethvin> tell mikesherov the source of the "ignore width" behavior is http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/1599 ... we'll have to decide whether to change it
[19:36:26] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I've abandoned the approach for now
[19:36:33] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov, that was so 3.5 hours ago ... current thinking here: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11604
[19:37:06] <DaveMethvin> gnarf and i talked about it
[19:37:17] <mikesherov> Hmmm
[19:37:20] <mikesherov> OK then
[19:37:28] <mikesherov> glad I kept the format-patch then
[19:37:30] <mikesherov> :-P
[19:37:41] <mikesherov> it may still not be performant
[19:37:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah, you know how i am
[19:38:11] <mikesherov> I also think I've changed the behavior accidentally too
[19:38:37] <DaveMethvin> like, how?
[19:38:52] <mikesherov> because I think the effects code is like... "animate from 200 to -200 in 400 ms"
[19:39:08] <mikesherov> which would correct to "animate from 200 to 0 in 400 ms"
[19:39:25] <DaveMethvin> oh
[19:39:41] <DaveMethvin> i thought it would limit on each step?
[19:39:42] <mikesherov> where putting that responsibility onto css would be "animate from 200 to 200 in 200ms and then do nothign for 200ms"
[19:40:03] <mikesherov> I need to check the effects stuff more
[19:40:07] <mikesherov> I'm not 100% positive
[19:40:26] <mikesherov> I literally just reverted the change. I was going to explore some other stuff before coming back to that
[19:40:43] <DaveMethvin> no hurry, focus on your favorites
[19:41:03] <mikesherov> Yeah, I just know there are more ways in which we could offload to css for this stuff
[19:41:30] <DaveMethvin> it's just so hard to do hand to hand combat with them
[19:41:34] <mikesherov> like fxAttrs is just staring me in the face waiting for the css solution to pop out
[19:42:06] <DaveMethvin> like that $("body") one that gained us 24 bytes, but it was put in to game some ancient selector benchmark :P
[19:42:29] <mikesherov> right
[19:42:36] <mikesherov> and I was discussing with jaubourg
[19:42:45] <mikesherov> there is some other really easy pickups
[19:43:09] <mikesherov> for example: Line 170 on css.js
[19:43:23] <mikesherov> we do "elseif ( curcss )"
[19:43:31] <mikesherov> small, but we can just nix that
[19:43:50] <mikesherov> do we support ANY browsers that don't have currentStyle nor getComputedStyle?
[19:44:03] <DaveMethvin> i don't think so anymore
[19:44:03] <mikesherov> I mean, keeping it to support some random non-smart phone maybe?
[19:44:14] <DaveMethvin> right, phones are the wild card
[19:44:24] <mikesherov> and is THAT the line that's going to prevent it all from crumbling down?
[19:44:42] <mikesherov> I mean, really, by the time we get to THAT else if?
[19:45:22] <DaveMethvin> right, like we basically can't do css, but gee at least we didn't give you TEH ERRORZ
[19:45:37] <mikesherov> seriously
[19:45:38] <DaveMethvin> there is one in jquery.fn.init to fix some problem in blackberry 4.6
[19:45:51] <DaveMethvin> which seems to have been released in 2008
[19:45:56] <mikesherov> right
[19:46:01] <mikesherov> like killing that else if saves 6 bytes
[19:46:09] <mikesherov> and takes 2 minutes to remove
[19:46:19] <mikesherov> I fought for 2 hours to get the 12 bytes the other way
[19:46:38] <DaveMethvin> but of course has unknown implications, since it probably went in there for some reason
[19:46:43] <mikesherov> MAYBE
[19:46:48] <DaveMethvin> right, only MAYBE
[19:47:10] <DaveMethvin> and in some cases i think maybe we should just take it out and see if anything breaks
[19:47:18] <mikesherov> but I am trying to reason here... it's impossible that's the line that causes the deck of cards to crumble
[19:47:23] <mikesherov> Yeah, we should
[19:47:30] <mikesherov> TRACTOR BEAM ACTIVATE
[19:47:41] <DaveMethvin> b/c even for browsers we support like IE6, whatever it is there is a good chance it's so obscure that nobody runs into it anymore
[19:47:59] <DaveMethvin> and if it really still matters, well there's always 1.8.1
[19:48:17] <mikesherov> but ti's not for IE6
[19:48:22] <DaveMethvin> right not that one
[19:48:29] <mikesherov> example: getWidthOrHeight references curCSS without the check
[19:48:37] <mikesherov> if that works, NO WAY that else if does shit
[19:48:45] <DaveMethvin> true dat
[19:49:27] <mikesherov> in fact, I'm PR'ing that right now
[19:49:32] <mikesherov> NOT EVEN TESTING IT
[19:49:46] <DaveMethvin> you rogue
[19:51:53] <DaveMethvin> Damn, Mobile still supports Blackberry 4.x http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/
[19:52:00] <mikesherov> ARG
[19:52:04] <DaveMethvin> C GRADE
[19:52:15] <mikesherov> Didn't we discuss this? There is no way we can support those browsers
[19:52:25] <mikesherov> you still have my 8 million questions, right?
[19:52:36] <DaveMethvin> yep, but no answers
[19:53:04] <DaveMethvin> srsly in reality we're releasing versions without testing on mobile browsers atm
[19:53:14] <DaveMethvin> i've been meaning to check the emulators on browserstack now
[19:54:21] <mikesherov> your eyes will bleed

[19:55:21] <DaveMethvin> i did run the nexus one android 2.3 browser, yes it was ugly
[19:55:48] <DaveMethvin> not sure if i can put it in a swarm, it was kinda flakey
[19:56:05] <mikesherov> yeah, I tried a few
[19:56:15] <mikesherov> some ran a test per second, literally
[19:56:27] <DaveMethvin> that is another problem
[19:56:45] <DaveMethvin> i would like to run a test coverage tool on our unit tests
[19:56:57] <DaveMethvin> i think we burn the crap out of some paths and snub others
[19:57:03] <mikesherov> yeah, ariya has done some awesome stuff with that recently
[19:57:22] <DaveMethvin> especially the old legacy stuff from years back
[19:57:27] <mikesherov> yup
[19:57:36] <paul_irish> i met the guy who wrote the codecov tool based on esprima at jsconf. he was cool
[19:57:37] <mikesherov> I'm sure lots of tests are way over covered
[19:58:04] <DaveMethvin> yes, and we don't get extra credit for that
[20:00:29] <mikesherov> gibson042 does a great job with this stuff, but I worry about clarity on some of these changes: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/743
[20:00:59] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery by gibson042 (9h, 53m ago): Optimizations in deferred.js
[20:02:30] <mikesherov> paul_irish: I'm blown away by everything ariya does, and all the things that have come out of that work, including the code coverage tools
[20:03:42] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: are there specific things that seem less clear?
[20:04:44] <DaveMethvin> i think his names make more sense
[20:05:48] <mikesherov> not really, it's amazing stuff. I just get a bit lost on things like: if ( i <= 1 ) {
[20:06:39] <DaveMethvin> it's surprising how much style can vary within a style guide
[20:08:06] <mikesherov_> .
[20:08:09] <mikesherov_> there I am
[20:08:32] <DaveMethvin> well your underscorey alter ego, must have been a transporter malfunction
[20:08:54] <mikesherov_> so, yeah, I mean, it's fine. I'm just in general wary of too many levels of indirection, you know... I suppose it's just a shock the first time.
[20:08:58] <mikesherov_> Objection withdrawn
[20:09:14] <DaveMethvin> the code was pretty dense before he started too
[20:09:21] <DaveMethvin> i think he definitely got the names better
[20:09:47] <DaveMethvin> but that was probably a side effect of figuring out what it did :)
[20:10:59] <mikesherov_> yup, fair enough
