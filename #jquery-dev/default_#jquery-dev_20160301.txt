[15:35:04] <s5fs> Notice! ZNC server is a bit tight for resources so I'm going to double the memory this evening. Unfortunately, this requires a reboot, so expect 5 minutes or so of downtime at some point later today.
[15:35:19] <s5fs> If you fall off IRC, or cannot log into ZNC, wait a few minutes and try again :)
[16:27:24] <nikhilshagri> Hi all, I am interested in applying for gsoc 2016, and I was browsing the ideas page, and the 'QUnit standard reporter interface' idea seemed interesting to me. However, I found that this was already one of the accepted projects for gsoc 2015. Can someone clarify whether this idea is still open for development?
[16:28:13] <arschmitz> @nikhilshagri yes it is
[16:28:23] <arschmitz> you would be continuing the work started last year
[16:30:00] <nikhilshagri> @arschmitz ah ok
[16:31:07] <nikhilshagri> I visited the issue page and the js-reporters page, and there's too much information about the whole thing, and I don't know where to start...
