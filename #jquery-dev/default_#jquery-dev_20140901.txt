[10:14:40] <rxaviers> markelog, hey oleg! you asked me to create a ticket for gh-1646. But, as DaveMethvin has pointed out it's a duplicate of gh-1595. Should my PR be closed as duplicate then? Thanks
[10:16:37] <markelog> rxaviers: no, i meant ticket for jscs  )
[10:17:18] <rxaviers> sure
[10:17:26] <rxaviers> ok

[14:53:53] <jzaefferer> Krinkle leobalter: Did you change the QUnit Jenkins job? At least last two builds failed due to error in sh script: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/QUnit/449/console looks to me like this line is broken, I've never seen this before: if [ "$?"-ne 0]; then exit 0; fi
[14:54:16] <Krinkle> I didn't, but the recent change in puppet by gnarf might have some influence.
[14:55:21] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Ha, looks like the same bug I had at Wikimedia is here as well
[14:55:23] <Krinkle> the highlighting being weird
[14:55:29] <Krinkle> colors won't stop
[14:55:40] <Krinkle> I like the new theme
[14:55:45] <Krinkle> Default?
[14:55:46] <jzaefferer> yeah, I guess that interferes with the actual script?
[14:55:55] <jzaefferer> I also just noticed the new theme
[14:56:14] <jzaefferer> I just looked at the configuration history for that job, I don't see anything wrong there
[14:56:43] <jzaefferer> Last change was mid July, failures started just a few days ago
[14:56:55] <Krinkle> The bash code you cited isn't the problem though
[14:57:00] <Krinkle> if anything that ensures we don't ignore the failure
[14:57:05] <Krinkle> the actual failure is reported by grunt
[14:57:09] <Krinkle> 11:11:19 Warning: Task "testswarm:74d566f6d5d5fac6e399e0bc158d83dfd6ace4dc:/usr/local/bin/tools/node-testswarm-config.json" failed. Use --force to continue.

[14:58:34] <Krinkle> also two timeout/fail
[14:58:50] <jzaefferer> ah, right
[14:59:02] <Krinkle> those lines are supposed to be black
[14:59:03] <jzaefferer> that output still sucks, those failures are so hard to spot :/
[14:59:07] <Krinkle> yeah
[14:59:22] <Krinkle> I blame the Jenkins plugin that converts shel colors to html <span>
[14:59:43] <Krinkle> or the script grunt uses for being sloppy and regular maybe bash tolerating it somehow.
[15:00:20] <jzaefferer> Maybe the color plugin needs to be updated to work with the new theme
[15:00:31] <Krinkle> Nah, it did the same on the old Jenknis
[15:01:03] <Krinkle> https://integration.wikimedia.org/ci/job/oojs-core-npm/274/console
[15:01:16] <Krinkle> Hm.. not as bad
[15:01:23] <Krinkle> used to be more like jquery's now
[15:03:11] <Krinkle> Updating Timestamper plugin
[15:05:23] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: Hm.. that's odd
[15:05:36] <Krinkle> plugin install restarted jenkins, now i'm logged out, I log back in, I'm no longer admin.
[15:10:09] <jzaefferer> Sounds fishy
[15:10:30] <jzaefferer> I'm still logged in

[15:37:00] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: I got sidetracked, but finally found the security page. User Krinkle still has the same rights as all other admins
[15:39:00] <Krinkle> There is no link in the sidebar to change jobs or manage jenkins
