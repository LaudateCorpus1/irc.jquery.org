[06:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> Has anyone used Brackets (the new editor from Adobe)?
[06:39:07] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez: I've played with it a bit. Node debugging seems promising, but I didn't actually get that to work yet.
[06:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it looks promising, but partially broken.
[06:39:48] <scott_gonzalez> Very innovative though.
[06:40:07] <timmywil> yea
[06:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> The fact that it highlights elements in the live preview based on where you cursor is in the source is pretty impressive.
[06:41:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to decide if I should spend time playing with it and adding JSHint support in place of JSLint.
[06:42:36] <timmywil> I think it would get used. I'm sticking with sublime for now.
[07:00:40] <scott_gonzalez> Damnit GitHub. Where did the history button go in the new UI?
[07:01:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the commits tab that doesn't look like a tab...
[07:44:08] <timmywil> gibson042: need your opinion
[07:44:39] <gibson042> fantastic opening :)
[07:44:42] <gibson042> what've you got?
[07:45:00] <timmywil> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14038
[07:45:09] <timmywil> non-pixel units + border-box
[07:46:06] <timmywil> jQuery has historically treated em and other units as secondary citizens, not getting the special treatment that we give pixels
[07:46:23] <timmywil> in some places, we've had to convert to pixels
[07:46:38] <timmywil> but if someone sets with a non-px unit, they're out of luck in some situations
[07:46:52] <gibson042> yeah, there's actually a nice block to do just that before animating
[07:47:39] <gibson042> I'm of the opinion that we *should* do the right thing, but obviously size, effort, and historically relevant behavior can get in the way
[07:47:46] <timmywil> maybe we should always convert to pixels when setting width/height, or if we want to keep the same behavior, we could skip augmenting width/height values at all if their not pixels
[07:48:09] <timmywil> the latter is a one-line patch
[07:48:38] <gibson042> is .width() box-sizing aware right now?
[07:48:49] <timmywil> aware, yes
[07:49:14] <timmywil> setting with .css is still different than setting with .width
[07:49:53] <gibson042> I'm in favor of that.... .css is a more direct interface to inline style, but width is "do what I want"
[07:50:18] <timmywil> I'm in favor of that too, but the main issue is how we treat em
[07:50:24] <gibson042> we'd be within our rights to make width cast down to pixels
[07:51:09] <timmywil> you said there's already conversion to pixels in effects? or are your referring to curCSS?
[07:52:14] <gibson042> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/6fd5e480c1cd3e481e7097763ee281b65bc74306/src/effects.js#L8-L41
[07:52:58] <gibson042> it's actually even more general than that, converting to the specified animation unit
[07:53:51] <timmywil> I could see us getting into trouble if computed values for border/margin/padding aren't pixels in some browsers
[07:54:27] <gibson042> if we go this route, they don't need to be
[07:54:52] <timmywil> well, they need to be the same as the unit being set, yea?
[07:55:26] <timmywil> "10em" + "2px" don't work
[07:55:45] <gibson042> that block just figures out the ratio between the two
[07:56:10] <gibson042> once you have that, set in either unit you like
[07:58:24] <gibson042> given the desired unit, read the property specified differently and then try setting it in the desired unit until you get a match
[07:58:47] <gibson042> then use the match as dictated by box-sizing
[08:00:10] <gibson042> but I think it'll have to happen independently for each unit in width/padding/border/margin, and maybe even more often than that because % may not be the same for e.g. margin and padding
[08:00:26] <gibson042> so it could be slow
[08:00:40] <gibson042> I've got a meeting now... back in 15-20 minutes
[08:00:44] <timmywil> right
[08:00:48] <timmywil> ok
[08:19:47] <gibson042> back

[10:32:05] <gvilla23> Who can I speak to about hosting a company sponsored jQuery Meet-Up?
