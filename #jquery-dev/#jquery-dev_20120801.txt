[06:00:45] <ajpiano> what the actual http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12173
[06:04:07] <gnarf> ajpiano: ?!
[06:04:39] <ajpiano> i don't even
[06:15:20] <gibson042> hey gnarf, mornin to you too
[06:44:05] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: jQuery Mobile 1.2 alpha will be released today…stay tuned. ★ http://bit.ly/Ps1fiJ
[06:48:33] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: We just got a similar ticket for UI: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8471
[06:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, this is what I was afraid of, now we're going to get lots of these.
[06:49:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf danheberden: Any chance you can trace the IP?
[06:51:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ? is it opening up
[06:53:38] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I have a feeling they're going to trickle in all day.
[06:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> Might want to wait and see if that's true.
[06:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> We're up to 3.
[06:55:09] <gnarf> does trac keep track of ips?
[06:56:50] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe the SPAM stuff does?
[07:01:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it only sees 127.0.0.1 because of the proxy
[07:02:03] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> Well hopefully they don't start flooding us with tickets.
[07:06:07] <gnarf> im 90% sure its 81.25.45.63
[07:06:34] <gnarf> just based on the nginx logs, they submitted a few POST /newticket
[07:06:36] <gnarf> today
[07:20:28] <scott_gonzalez> http://groups.drupal.org/node/245858
[08:20:10] <jaubourg> scott_gonzalez: We don't have any history online about why Drupal would require dual licensing (apart from Ben's blog)
[08:20:13] <jaubourg> seems so weird
[08:21:51] <jaubourg> and that was a question without proper grammatical form nor question mark
[08:21:55] <jaubourg> so...
[08:21:56] <jaubourg> ?
[08:24:10] <jaubourg> scott_gonzalez: they actually asked html5shiv to change their licensing too... http://drupal.org/node/1077878
[08:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> jaubourg: Yeah, we'll see what they say.
[08:30:05] <jaubourg> scott_gonzalez: apart from some "purity" issue (we want everything GPL) on their part, I don't see the point, AFAIK, MIT is GPL compatible... but I'm soooo bad with licenses and their wordings :/
[08:30:44] <jaubourg> maybe seutje would have some insight seeing as he's a prominent Drupal community member
[08:30:47] <snover> MIT is GPL compatible
[08:30:50] <snover> there is no reason to use both
[08:30:54] <snover> MIT is less restrictive than GPL
[08:31:04] <jaubourg> that's what I thought
[08:32:40] <jaubourg> and hi snover :)
[08:32:45] <snover> hi jaubourg, ltns
[08:32:56] <jaubourg> indeed, how's life treating you my friend?
[08:33:27] <snover> not as nice as yours, i am sure :)
[08:34:02] <jaubourg> heh, I have a gf and it's finally a bit sunny in Belgium so I won't complain
[08:34:10] <jaubourg> \o/
[08:34:36] <jaubourg> could use some motivation regarding the things of code these days, but yeah, apart from that, things are good
[09:21:47] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell rwaldron You mentioned summary emails for TC39. I looked through a few threads but didn't see any. Could you point me to one?
[09:21:48] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[10:07:36] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: jQuery Mobile 1.2.0 Alpha Released! New popup widget, collapsible listviews and autodividers, design tweaks, fixes. http://t.co/B5x31FBg ★ http://bit.ly/R8Vcp4
[10:19:04] <Krinkle> gnarf: actually, 'krinkle' is my autoaway nickname when I disconnect from the bouncer
[10:19:25] <Krinkle> originally that was intentionally, but I think I'll stick to setting an away msg only, no nick change
[10:22:33] <Krinkle> fixed
[10:26:53] <jzaefferer> Krinkle: so you've got a bouncer now?
[10:30:27] <Krinkle> Yep
[10:30:53] <Krinkle> (I just rebooted my laptop)
[10:50:45] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez: yo
[10:51:19] <paul_irish> an angular contributor updated the listing page and accidentally removed jQuery UI
[10:51:31] <scott_gonzalez> jerk
[10:51:34] <paul_irish> srsly
[10:51:39] <paul_irish> i think its sabotage.
[10:51:45] <paul_irish> anyway its going back in now.
[10:51:54] <scott_gonzalez> Any update on 1.8.20 and 1.8.22?

[12:41:21] <gnarf> mikesherov: < 1week?
[12:41:30] <mikesherov> sure

[12:41:39] <gnarf> also
[12:41:39] <mikesherov> np
[12:41:42] <gnarf> if you feel inspired
[12:41:46] <mikesherov> k
[12:41:48] <gnarf> I can't think of a good way to solve this
[12:41:54] <gnarf> we can chat latter about why if you're busy
[12:43:38] <gnarf> although thinking about a better description of the problem has led me to a solution I haven't tried yet
[12:45:24] <mikesherov> it's cool
[12:45:28] <mikesherov> what's the core of the issue
[12:46:29] <gnarf> so there is this concept of a "partial color"
[12:46:42] <gnarf> i.e. you could $.Color({ saturation: 0 })
[12:46:57] <gnarf> and animate any color to that
[12:47:00] <gnarf> and it desaturates
[12:47:36] <gnarf> so when you call $.Color({ hue: 300, saturation: 1, lightness: 0.5 })
[12:47:46] <gnarf> it doesn't create the "red" "green" and "blue"
[12:49:04] <gnarf> i'm thinking if i just detect that hue/sat/lightness/alpha are all defined
[13:14:20] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Color build #64: SUCCESS in 8 min 27 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Color/64/
[13:14:20] <doesallmagic> Corey Frang: Assume if someone defines everything but alpha that it is NOT a 'partial color' - Fixes #28
[13:37:03] <paul_irish> scott_gonzalez:
[13:37:03] <b-ot> paul_irish, you have one new message, say “read” to me when you wish to read it.
[13:37:15] <paul_irish> > Ok, this is funny... There was a script in the head with the same id "jqueryui", so it appended there instead...
[13:44:22] <_|Nix|_> Hey! I have a performance question: Is it true that, if I call .addClass() with a class that has already been added, or if I call .removeClass() and none of the classes I specify are present, then no DOM manipulation takes place?
[13:44:56] <_|Nix|_> Like, not even setting the className to itself?
[13:46:53] <_|Nix|_> I have a situation where I have to apply exactly one of four classes. So, I call .removeClass( "the other three" ).addClass( "fourth" ) ...
[13:48:17] <_|Nix|_> ... and I do this whenever the user moves the mouse. Thus, I'd like to make sure that nothing whatsoever heavy happens if none of "the", "other", and "three" is present when I call .removeClass(), and likewhise, nothing heavy happens when I call .addClass( "fourth" ) and "fourth" is already added.
[13:49:25] <_|Nix|_> My alternative is to save the added class in a .data() and check against that, and if different, .removeClass() the value from .data(), add the new class, and update the .data().
[13:49:41] <_|Nix|_> That's slightly more complicated, but if it performs better, I'll do it.
