[11:10:04] <rwaldron> Linting the tests is awesome.
[11:10:09] <rwaldron> ...I'm lying.
[11:20:49] <gnarf> rwaldron: yeah?
[11:20:53] <gnarf> rwaldron: because tests shouldn't conform to the rest of the styles?
[11:21:06] <gnarf> or is there some like legit issue with the concept
[11:51:43] <rwaldron> gnarf no,  I mean... I'm linting them
[11:51:47] <rwaldron> and it sucks
[11:51:54] <rwaldron> we've been lazy in the tests
[11:51:54] * gnarf hugs rwaldron
[11:51:57] * gnarf nods
[11:52:04] <gnarf> want me to take a few files?
[11:52:34] <gnarf> I figured there was a reason we weren't linting tests
[11:52:41] <gnarf> and it had to be that they were full of lint
[11:57:33] <rwaldron> gnarf thanks, but I'm almost done
[11:57:37] <rwaldron> what you CAN do
[11:57:43] <rwaldron> figure out how I can get around this...
[11:57:47] <rwaldron> [L504:C15] Don't use extra leading zeros '0144'.

[12:17:43] <rwaldron> nice and clean now
[12:17:52] <timmywil> nice!
[12:19:05] <rwaldron> pushing in a moment
[12:19:10] <timmywil> oh, btw, little thing, but for the jshint options in grunt.js, isn't using both `predef` and `globals` redundant? I'm pretty sure it's the same thing.
[12:20:45] <timmywil> i.e. "define" in predef vs define: true in globals
[12:21:44] <timmywil> rwaldron: before you push ^^

[12:35:16] <rwaldron> does this boax do all magic?
[12:35:50] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i like it!
[12:35:51] <rwaldron> timmywil the comments are awkward
[12:35:53] <rwaldron> but <3
[12:35:56] <DaveMethvin> what do you think rwaldron
[12:36:11] <timmywil> yea, we don't actually need those when there are docs
[12:36:12] <rwaldron> I'm into this
[12:36:20] <rwaldron> timmywil nooo... i like inline
[12:36:30] <rwaldron> i just mean the actual text is awkward
[12:36:33] <rwaldron> "If specified, context should be a document and the fragment will be created in this context"
[12:36:37] <DaveMethvin> dontcha guys know, javadoc all the way now
[12:36:42] * DaveMethvin runs away
[12:36:46] <timmywil> rwaldron: oh ok
[12:36:55] <rwaldron> "If specified, the fragment will be created in this context, defaults to document"
[12:37:01] <rwaldron> flip that part around
[12:37:08] <timmywil> gotcha
[12:37:10] <rwaldron> i like having notes like this
[12:37:19] <rwaldron> actually, i should add notes about the lint stiff
[12:37:21] <rwaldron> stuff*
[12:37:22] <rwaldron> maybe
[12:37:24] <rwaldron> eh
[12:37:32] <rwaldron> no more functions in loops people.
[12:38:00] <DaveMethvin> oh you want errors, rwaldron? try "use strict"
[12:38:09] <rwaldron> :O
[12:38:19] <timmywil> aight, comment edited
[12:39:26] <rwaldron> I can break it.
[12:39:36] <rwaldron> jQuery.parseHTML("<div>", {})
[12:39:50] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/9Hvlkg
[12:39:50] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Add parseHTML for explicitly parsing strings into html. Fixes #11617. - timmywil
[12:40:30] <rwaldron> I only remember that breakage, because I patched soemthing similar previously for the context object
[12:40:59] <timmywil> hmm, I would think that would error for this method
[12:42:29] <rwaldron> So, we're going to just go with "TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'createElement'"
[12:42:45] <rwaldron> I think most devs expect jQuery to be silent about stuff
[12:42:52] <rwaldron> what YOU think?
[12:43:23] <timmywil> context should be a document or not specified, there are many things that could be passed to break it. I would suspect that most of the time, context will not be specified.
[12:43:43] <rwaldron> sounds good to me
[12:43:46] <rwaldron> BUT
[12:43:58] <rwaldron> I bet you $1 that we will get a ticket filed for it.
[12:44:19] <rwaldron> (I'm totally ok with not doing anything, and we can close that ticket "wont fix")
[12:45:47] <timmywil> I'd be more inclined to validate all of the arguments if this was a prototype method. what you think DaveMethvin ?
[12:46:20] <DaveMethvin> if we say it shoudl be a document and  you pass an object, then you are a poopie-head
[12:46:53] <DaveMethvin> damn you api design, why must  you be so hard?
[12:46:55] <rwaldron> +1
[12:46:56] * DaveMethvin shakes fist
[12:47:13] <rwaldron> I wish IRC had emoji
[12:47:18] <rwaldron> anyway
[12:47:21] <rwaldron> timmywil +1
[12:47:21] <DaveMethvin> i mean, we also have a boolean as the third arg, and i know some people don't like boolean args
[12:47:24] <rwaldron> nice job!
[12:47:42] <timmywil> thanks :)
[12:47:47] <rwaldron> people that don't like boolean args can cram it
[12:47:58] <DaveMethvin> we started with the options object, which is nice i guess but a little messier if people are going to default the two most of the time
[12:47:59] <rwaldron> that's like... the silliest argument to have
[12:48:05] <rwaldron> of course it's confusing
[12:48:08] <rwaldron> RTFM
[12:48:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah, not like tabs vs spaces
[12:48:11] <rwaldron> NBD
[12:48:12] <DaveMethvin> :D
[12:48:31] <DaveMethvin> timmywil thanks, it's been crazy round here
[12:48:36] <rwaldron> ok, so heads up
[12:48:45] <rwaldron> we are -1 assertion after linting
[12:48:51] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you're welcome, glad to get back in the thick of it
[12:48:53] <rwaldron> the OctalIntegerLiteral test
[12:48:56] <rwaldron> for isNumber
[12:49:09] <rwaldron> those have been deprecated since 1999
[12:49:17] <DaveMethvin> lol yeah like we know mr linty
[12:49:21] <rwaldron> and jslint/hint have no option to shut it up
[12:49:28] <DaveMethvin> IT MUST DIE
[12:49:29] <rwaldron> um
[12:49:32] <rwaldron> I just looked it up
[12:49:42] <rwaldron> it was pretty "in yo face"
[12:49:51] <rwaldron> so, its commented for now
[12:50:13] <DaveMethvin> in vim i think the key you're looking for is "dd"
[12:50:22] <rwaldron> also, anywhere that was using new String() is now: var MyString = String; ... new MyString() to avoid jshint whining about that
[12:50:26] <rwaldron> same with Number
[12:50:53] <rwaldron> aside from that, the rest was basically cleaning up our own laziness

[12:53:08] <DaveMethvin> so i'm planning to work at the airport
[12:53:19] <DaveMethvin> they have starbucks and everything!
[12:53:29] <DaveMethvin> maybe i'll get strip searched
[12:53:35] <timmywil> yay!
[12:53:42] <DaveMethvin> gimme an arduino
[12:53:44] <timmywil> wait
[12:53:51] <timmywil> yea ok
[12:54:01] <DaveMethvin> anything else need to land for beta?
[12:54:11] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I have one little space saver
[12:55:01] <DaveMethvin> gotta go, but will be back online soon
[12:56:06] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I missed the meeting, didn't I? I think I miscalculated the timezone

[13:04:24] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: ... right
[13:04:40] <jzaefferer> Next time :-)
[13:04:50] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: I'm reading the logs at irc.jq.com
[13:04:59] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: regarding perf, I imagine maybe Jenkins could do the graphification of that?
[13:05:12] <Krinkle> It supports it built-in, given that the data is given from the unit tester
[13:05:18] <Krinkle> e.g. if we'd measure it in QUnit
[13:05:25] <Krinkle> That's a different kind of testing though
[13:05:51] <Krinkle> I suppose you were talking about performance for certain tests only (i.e. by iterating 1000 times)
[13:06:15] <jzaefferer> I really don't know, johnbend1r brought that up, I don't have details beyond whats in the log file
[13:06:30] <jzaefferer> though if you've got input, just talk to him
[13:06:32] <Krinkle> I assumed he meant the latter since he mentioned jsperf
[13:06:36] <Krinkle> sure
[13:06:43] <jzaefferer> gotta go, ttyl
[13:07:15] <Krinkle> but aside from that, we can also get performance stats of the regular test suite in Jenkins, so we can se that e.g. "12 minutes for the build", "3 minutes for core", "30 seconds for core in Chrome 19"
[13:07:25] <Krinkle> 1ms for core - test foo
[13:07:27] <Krinkle> etc.
[13:07:39] <Krinkle> We do that at Wikimedia for the PHPUnit tests
[13:07:48] <Krinkle> through jUnit format
[13:07:53] <Krinkle> or ant's xml rather
[13:09:29] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: just for demonstration purposes (so you know what to expect)
[13:09:30] <Krinkle> https://integration.mediawiki.org/ci/job/MediaWiki-Tests-Databaseless/2329/testReport/?
[13:09:53] <Krinkle> the build will have a "Test result" link in the side bar of each build, and from there starts a table with (root) and from there you can nagivate all the way down to the assertion level
[13:10:06] <Krinkle> and of each assertion or group of assertions you can get historical graphs
[13:10:09] <Krinkle> pretty neat

[13:11:54] <Krinkle> anyway, one thing at a time :)
[13:12:36] <Krinkle> jzaefferer: one other thing I'd like you to know is that a developer at Yahoo who works on (or created, not sure) .. Yeti!
[13:12:49] <Krinkle> ... emailed me
[13:14:04] <Krinkle> not sure how he knew, but he catches on that I wanted to try something different for a possible TestSwarm 2.0 that is completely as an instant-on cloud service (e.g. from your command line before committing, and have you join browsers manually on the temporary localhost node server)
[13:14:18] <Krinkle> but the same script can be used from jenkins and then browserstack would fill the swarm instead
[13:14:56] <Krinkle> no database, no storage, purely event driven
[13:15:12] <Krinkle> I'll tell more about it in the next meeting, this is purely hypothetical at this point

[14:24:19] <DaveMethvin> the error check? meh i dunno if we should check the arg more than others but i could go either way
[14:26:58] <timmywil> yea, I don't feel too strongly about it
[14:27:33] <timmywil> I could see it being helpful if the context arg gets used, but I imagine its biggest use is internal
[14:30:09] <timmywil> I'll stick it on a branch
