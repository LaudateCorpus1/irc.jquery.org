[14:52:14] <Krinkle> Is attr('key', null) resulting in removeAttr('key') officially supported?
[14:52:28] <Krinkle> It is explicitly coded, and makes for a nice round-trip between getting null and setting null
[14:52:49] <Krinkle> e.g. in cheap code that reads certain attributes and later restores them

[16:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell Krinkle I'm not sure on the official stance, but I've certainly used that before.
[16:19:28] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Iâ€™ll tell Krinkle about that.
[16:19:58] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: I'm not very good at writing doc prose. Want me to submit a patch / could you?
[16:19:58] <b-ot> Krinkle: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[16:20:02] <Krinkle> `read
[16:20:03] <b-ot> Krinkle: From scott_gonzalez, 33s ago: I'm not sure on the official stance, but I've certainly used that before.
[16:20:23] <scott_gonzalez> Weird, my IRC client isn't showing that you're on.
[16:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> Probably messed up from the net split earlier.
[16:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> Let's wait for Dave or someone else on the core team to give a +1.
[16:21:29] <scott_gonzalez> You can file an issue about it if you want to verify that way instead of waiting for someone to read the backlog.
[16:40:41] <Krinkle> ok
[16:41:09] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Hm.. didn't we have an 'edit' link at some point that points to the github repo directly?
[16:41:13] <Krinkle> on doc generated pages

[16:46:51] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15Krinkle opened issue #523: attr: Document attr(key, null) to remove attribute 02http://git.io/STmH4w
[16:47:53] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: thx
[16:48:37] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: Hm.. right, we return undefined now, not null for whe the attribute doesn't exist
[16:48:46] <Krinkle> and attr('foo', undefined) does not remove the attribute
[16:49:20] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: I think we should support that, too (that makes more sense than null, I reckon it's probably a left over from when we used to return null)
[16:49:56] <Krinkle> right now my reasoning for documenting attr(key, null) isn't really true because it doesn't actually roundtrip between getting/setting attr()
[16:50:09] <Krinkle> If you don't think it's completely insane or surely wontfix, I'll file a bug
[16:51:17] <Krinkle> If I didn't know better I'd think someone accidentally copied a sleep(20) statement from an ajax test into trac source code.
[16:52:53] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[16:53:19] <Krinkle> it took 30 seconds to load /newticket to tell me I'm not logged in. It's taking well over 2 minutes now to load the login page
[17:00:29] <snover> did someone break the code that defeated the trac housekeeping that ran way too often and locked all the tables?
