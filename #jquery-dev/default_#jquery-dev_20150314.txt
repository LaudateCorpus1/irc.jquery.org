[01:25:55] <doesallmagic2> Project jQuery Core Compat Periodic build #164: STILL UNSTABLE in 27 min: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Core%20Compat%20Periodic/164/
[04:30:22] <JamesMGreene> <Krinkle>	Did we break contextless async testing in 1.17? https://github.com/kof/node-qunit/pull/118
[04:30:30] <JamesMGreene> We didn't "break" it
[04:30:36] <JamesMGreene> We tightened it up
[04:31:31] <JamesMGreene> Arguably it was more a bug fix than a new feature, so you can argue against supporting backward compatibility of that behavior
[04:38:20] <JamesMGreene> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/653#discussion_r17260617
[04:42:11] <JamesMGreene> anyway, I left a comment on the node-qunit issue thread about it
[04:42:16] <JamesMGreene> thanks for looping us in
[08:33:41] <Krinkle> JamesMGreeneAway: Sure, fixing it in node-qunit would be cool too. As long as we figure it out :)
[08:33:43] <Krinkle> Thanks for looking
[09:20:25] <kristijan__> hello
[10:21:38] <TheDavidFactor> I was sent here from #jquery. I've got an issue that want to verify before opening a bug report
[10:22:11] <TheDavidFactor> I'm trying to "zoom" an absolutely positioned div out from the center of the page by using top, right, bottom, left percentages from 50% to 10%. fiddle here: http://jsfiddle.net/3mmbz3ko/2/
[10:22:32] <TheDavidFactor> I've tested in chrome, IE, FireFox, Safari mobile and chrome mobile and only FireFox exhibits the issue: for about the first half of the animate the div moves left and up without growing. and then grows to full size from the new starting point.
[10:23:13] <TheDavidFactor> Since it only happens in FireFox I thought it might be a FireFox bug, but it didn't start happening until after jQuery 1.7.2 so that makes me wonder if it's a jQuery bug
[10:36:44] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15TheDavidFactor opened issue #2144: FireFox animation issue 02http://git.io/pA3l
[11:21:55] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15osolo opened issue #2145: $.each fails intermittently on iOS due to Safari bug 02http://git.io/pAuR
[11:49:50] <m_gol> another weird Safari bug!
