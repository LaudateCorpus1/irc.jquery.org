[07:17:04] <markelog> m_gol: sup?
[07:29:39] <m_gol> markelog: what's the versioning strategy of Yandex.Browser?
[07:29:47] <m_gol> I'm trying to decipher 14.12 :)
[07:29:56] <markelog> year.month
[07:30:02] <m_gol> ah
[07:30:07] <markelog> basically there is no release cycle :(
[07:30:13] <m_gol> I see
[07:30:18] <markelog> new version will come up when it is ready
[07:30:28] <markelog> there is also "beta" version of the browser
[07:30:38] <m_gol> btw, BrowserStack seems to have an old version, right? latest stable is 15.2
[07:30:38] <markelog> which is whole different interface
[07:30:44] <markelog> 15.6
[07:30:52] <markelog> i already wrote them a letter about this
[07:30:54] <m_gol> ok, Wiki has outdated info then :)
[07:31:19] <markelog> yeah, it was released pretty recently 
[07:31:22] <m_gol> yeah, if they support it, they should keep it up to date
[07:31:35] <markelog> true that!
[07:31:45] <markelog> that is cool you keeping on eye on such things
[07:32:02] <markelog> a lot has improved since you started noticed these things
[07:32:14] <markelog> like our trunk is always green now!
[07:32:19] <markelog> which is awesome )
[08:05:43] <m_gol> markelog: thanks :)
[08:06:02] <m_gol> I'd love to get the periodic job green as well :P
[08:06:11] <m_gol> but Android 2.3 is trying hard to make that not happen :P

[09:42:01] <m_gol> gibson042 markelog are we all OK with testing only latest Opera, not 2 latest versions? I know DaveMethvin|away was OK with that

[11:35:54] <gnarf> heh m_gol - my feeling exactly --- â˜¹
[11:37:25] <m_gol> I wonder what percentage of users of such phones use the default terrible browser instead of e.g. Firefox
[11:37:31] <m_gol> but I suspect most, unfortunately
[13:04:16] <arschmitz> Hi everyone sorry i was not in meeting i was setting up a new laptop
[13:09:12] <arschmitz> i responded to the 2 issue and as you all i think suspected i have a hard time justifying removing support for android. iOS 6 i'm ok with.
