[08:53:13] <Batt224> Okay guys you should really work on the docs and the learning site
[08:53:34] <arthurvr> Batt224: 100% agreed, weâ€™ve been trying to do so (still a bunch to do tho), all contributions are welcome!
[09:03:31] <Batt224> Come on docs are important so take care of them
[09:04:27] <Batt224> who's the Guy responsible for api.jquery.com
[09:05:45] <robertmaxrees> there a problem with the documentation?
[09:06:47] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: I think he just means the 90 open issues :-(
[09:07:21] <robertmaxrees> Hrm.  I've been looking to make some contributions.
[09:08:07] <Batt224> arthurvr is right on that
[09:08:47] <Batt224> some are from 2012
[09:09:07] <Batt224> that's 3 years ago
[09:09:30] <Batt224> that's 712 days
[09:09:38] <markelog___> how many seconds?
[09:10:17] <Batt224> 61516800
[09:11:24] <markelog___> did you count the leap second?
[09:11:30] <arthurvr> Batt224: you forgot the leap year
[09:11:38] <arthurvr> good point markelog___
[09:12:32] <markelog___> we know how many issues are open, if you can help, that would be awesome!
[09:13:08] <robertmaxrees> he keeps joining and quitting haha
[09:13:37] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: :-)
[09:13:42] <markelog___> )
[09:16:10] <robertmaxrees> what sort of prioritization is there on issues for the api site?
[09:16:47] <arthurvr> My opinion is that we should maybe first get some old PRs out of the way
[09:17:01] <arthurvr> 16 open currently
[09:17:35] <arthurvr> I mean, thatâ€™s 16 issues closed without that much of work :)
[09:18:19] <robertmaxrees> so what can a newbie like me do to help close that gap?
[09:20:12] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: Are contributions would be awesome! Only right workflow is to go over issues and try to get PRs out.
[09:20:30] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[10:48:35] * JamesMGreene sighs
[10:49:02] <JamesMGreene> Can't wait for the CSS `:has` pseudo-selector to be a real boy....
[11:02:36] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: it will only exist in the slow profile (i.e. only via JS), though
[11:03:42] <JamesMGreene> Awwww crap
[11:04:03] <JamesMGreene> Indeed, I see that now
[11:04:11] <JamesMGreene> Could've made that more obvious in the spec
[11:04:43] <JamesMGreene> Did they also drop the reference combination selector?
[11:12:28] <JamesMGreene> (the `label /for/ input { border: 1px solid red; }` thing)
