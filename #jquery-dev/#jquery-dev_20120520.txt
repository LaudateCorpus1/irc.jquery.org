[10:15:22] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: I updated the PR for the dimension setters, went from +177 -> +110. A bit slower because of the additional function call, but I don't think it's the bottleneck

[12:29:30] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: dimensions can also be modularized fairly easily, after gibson042's PR lands, I can do one for dimensions. When using box-sizing:border-box, a lot of the dimension stuff isn't really necessary.
[15:26:11] <faryshta> I would like to ask. How does the $(function (){..}); method works? Why when I pass two functions they doesn't rewrite each other?
[15:38:53] <Stephen_> faryshta: Because they are anonymous functions
[15:39:11] <Stephen_> Their scope is passed in the recieving variables, they are not named "function"
[15:39:25] <Stephen_> They are not named at all as far as the global or local scope is concerned
[15:41:57] <eeklund> Does anyone know if there is a channel specific to the jQuery Validation plug-in?
[15:44:04] <faryshta> Stephen_, ok. How are the two anonymous functions stored and fired? Does it use the callback method?
[15:46:01] <Stephen> ok, so let's disect this.
[15:46:21] <Stephen> $(function (){..}) is only one function. Can you give me an example of how you are passing 2?
[15:48:29] <eeklund> With regard to the validation plugin, I am trying to figure out if there is a way to run a validation rule that isn't tied to a static form element.  Does anyone know if you can run a function that would poll dynamic hidden fields and compare them to static ones?
[15:49:07] <snover> eeklund: this is not the support chat.
[15:49:41] <Stephen> eeklund: Let's talk in a msg, I'm happy to help, but snover is right
[15:49:41] <eeklund> No one responded to my message earlier when asking for the appropriate channel. ;)
[15:49:46] <Stephen> snover: Is there a support channel?
[15:49:55] <snover> see the topic…
[15:50:14] <Stephen> eeklund; Still though, snover is right. Let's take this somewhere more appropriate
[15:50:33] <eeklund> I'm happy to take it elsewhere.
[15:50:55] <Stephen> sorry about that, snover.
[15:52:19] <Stephen> eeklund: see me in #jquery
[15:54:55] <Stephen> faryshta: So sorry, got confused for a second
[15:56:23] <Stephen> faryshta: So sorry
[15:56:28] <Stephen> anyway
[15:59:00] <Stephen> $() is a jquery method which basically means "execute the contained method when jquery/page is finished loading"
[15:59:54] <Stephen> note: when you pass it a function. I'm sure you're familiar with the standard usage when grabbing elements.
[16:01:40] <Stephen> so $(function(){..}) is very similar to function(){...}()
[16:02:00] <Stephen> the only difference is "execute after load" instead of "execute now".
[16:05:20] <Stephen> So, iirc, the only way to pass 2 functions into that would be $(function(){..}); $(function(){...});, in which case they would execute in order, both writing to their local scopes (unless you specified global ones) and then are each instantly destroyed after being executed.
[16:30:06] <faryshta> Stephen, cool.
[16:31:32] <faryshta> Stephen, but there is a thing I don't understand. I know how it works and I just want to know why? Which is the way jquery pass it to the DOM events. How do jquery store the anonymous functions? AFAIK it uses a stack but I might be wrong.
[16:31:58] <faryshta> Stephen, I mean I want to know the internal functioning of jquery.
[16:38:05] <Stephen> faryshta: I believe this system would be governed by deferreds at this point, but I haven't looked at the code
[16:38:56] <Stephen> Can someone speak as to whether $() is creating a deferred queue in the background which executes after jquery loads?
[16:42:30] <Stephen> I'm betting it uses a queue at this point, but all that would be necessary is an array of functions to execute, and a callback method which is hit at the end of the jquery library. for each the array and call each one in the window scope, done.
[16:43:35] <Stephen> I'd suggest looking at the source near the very end, one of the method calls there should be what you're looking for.
[16:44:36] <faryshta> Stephen, I found this https://raw.github.com/jquery/jquery/test-jhp/src/callbacks.js
[16:44:59] <faryshta> But I don't know if this is the function called to do the internal work.
[16:45:17] <faryshta> Stephen, http://api.jquery.com/category/callbacks-object/ documentation.
[16:52:48] <Stephen> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/978acb9caf9ad5e645e1e5188a0120f05822cc81/src/core.js
[16:52:51] <Stephen> Line 391
[16:53:00] <Stephen> Look through that method
[16:53:25] <Stephen> Line 409 shows that it uses a collection of deffereds to handle it
