[07:12:03] <apsdehal> For the jQuery core project that is "better testing infrastructure", we want to implement a module/cli that combines karma and browser-stack (node) to give an interface to run both and return results?

[08:07:31] <bePolite> Hello
[08:10:09] <bePolite> Okay arschmitz I'm here
[08:10:39] <arschmitz> bePolite: leobalter and jzaefferer are the best people to talk to on this one
[08:10:45] <bePolite> Hello leobalter 
[08:10:55] <arschmitz> bePolite: i work with them and can help you but they are the ones that really work on this
[08:11:19] <bePolite> Okay
[08:11:26] <bePolite> It seems that bug has a lot of dependencies
[08:12:33] <bePolite> arschmitz: what about this https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/96
[08:12:35] <bePolite> Any Ideas?
[08:12:41] <bePolite> I see its closed on github
[08:14:15] <jzaefferer> bePolite: which project are you talking about?
[08:14:42] <bePolite> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/96
[08:14:49] <bePolite> jzaefferer: ^^
[08:15:05] <arschmitz> bePolite: thats a different issue and should be asked in #jqueryui-dev
[08:15:23] <arschmitz> bePolite: you asked about qunit before
[08:15:30] <bePolite> Yes
[08:16:11] <jzaefferer> still don't know what QUnit project you're talking about
[08:16:36] <bePolite> jzaefferer: THis was the qunit project https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/96
[08:17:08] <jzaefferer> That is about jQuery UI, not QUnit
[08:17:14] <bePolite> Sorry
[08:17:49] <bePolite> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/364
[08:18:01] <bePolite> jzaefferer: ^^
[08:18:11] <bePolite> I got mixed up with links
[08:20:13] <jzaefferer> bePolite: okay, that's fine. So yeah, that topic has a bunch of tickets
[08:20:35] <jzaefferer> we have a bit of work in progress on one of them: https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/764
[08:21:30] <bePolite> Okay I noticed from this comment https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/364#issuecomment-77025780
[08:22:06] <jzaefferer> that probably shouldn't be a checklist
[08:22:18] <jzaefferer> the same references are also in the original ticket
[08:22:27] <bePolite> jzaefferer: I'm not really good with Qunit though. Thats why I was thinking of switching to https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/96
[08:22:58] <bePolite> But I wanted to find out which issue is most important to the Jquery Dev Team
[08:23:28] <jzaefferer> bePolite: well, you can always learn more about QUnit. I think your interest is more important than what you already know
[08:24:01] <jzaefferer> bePolite: everything on the ideas list is important to each project; we'd work on those things eventually
[08:24:38] <jzaefferer> we already have several people interested in the QUnit diff project as well as the jQuery UI demos, so you may be better off picking something else
[08:25:17] <bePolite> Okay thanks for the tip
[08:26:10] <bePolite> jzaefferer:  could  you help in pointing out some projects which are are a little less crowded 
[08:26:12] <bePolite> ?
[08:26:41] <jzaefferer> I think Globalize Performance tests and Use native Ecma-402 implementation haven't seen much interest
[08:26:58] <jzaefferer> and jQuery Learning Center - Interactive tutorials for learn and other sites
[08:29:30] <bePolite> jzaefferer: The jQuery Learning Center sounds interesting
[08:30:21] <bePolite> So the project is about building something like http://www.codecademy.com/ for jquery?
[08:32:51] <jzaefferer> yeah, something like that

[12:44:23] <snover> how about using intern?
[12:45:25] <apsdehal> Yes that would also be good. What would be the prototype task for this project?
