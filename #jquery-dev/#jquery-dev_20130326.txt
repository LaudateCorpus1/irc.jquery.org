[06:49:57] <rcraig12> Greetings!
[06:50:26] <rcraig12> Are there anyone here from the core jQuery team available to talk to?
[07:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> rcraig12: What about?
[08:25:05] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ping
[08:25:21] <DaveMethvin> sup rwaldron
[08:25:44] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin good morning/noon
[08:26:01] <DaveMethvin> we got 30 minutes in morning!
[08:26:18] <rwaldron> If asked you what you thought our time table looked like, for 2.0 release, what would you say?
[08:26:36] <DaveMethvin> should be next month i hope
[08:26:42] <DaveMethvin> see the meeting notes
[08:26:52] <DaveMethvin> beta this week, final around april 15
[08:27:22] <DaveMethvin> i wanted to get your input on the node.js support
[08:27:30] <DaveMethvin> and see if there is anything we need to do for the beta
[08:28:00] <DaveMethvin> should we be doing npm releases for example?
[08:28:06] <rwaldron> obviously the meeting notes...
[08:28:11] <DaveMethvin> (not for beta obviously_
[08:28:38] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I don't really know to be honest
[08:28:52] <DaveMethvin> oh damn, that makes 2 of us :)
[08:28:54] <rwaldron> I will ping isaac
[08:29:06] <rwaldron> and ask him how we should proceed
[08:29:09] <DaveMethvin> if it makes sense then let's do it
[08:29:20] <DaveMethvin> also we don't have to do it the day we release
[08:30:23] <rwaldron> I just pinged him, I'll let you know when he gets back to me
[08:30:31] <DaveMethvin> k thanks
[08:55:14] <rcraig12> Hi sorry I was away from my desk are you still around scott_gonzalez?
[08:55:40] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ok, as long as the global object issues are sorted out, we should be good to go
[08:55:44] <scott_gonzalez> rcraig12: What did you want to talk about?
[08:55:52] <rwaldron> (just spoke to isaacs)
[08:56:25] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron so ARE the global object issues sorted out? don't recall where that left off
[08:57:33] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I dont know, but I'm going to ping domenic denicola and ask him to confirm
[08:58:02] <rcraig12> I am writing a small library that has a little jQuery dependency but also like the way in which jQuery makes use of anonymous functions. I have used the same design pattern for my library however I am not sure how to remap all the functions to the route object in the same way you have done in jQuery. I would be definately interested in any information that allows for this so I can continue with a similar design/pattern for my 
[08:58:09] <rwaldron> we'll need to add an entry to the package.json that points to dist/jquery.js
[08:59:24] <rcraig12> IfHope that  makes sense
[08:59:31] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron but we don't commit that file to the repo
[08:59:57] <DaveMethvin> sorry got to run
[09:00:15] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I'll figure it out
[09:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> rcraig12: I don't really follow, but it doesn't really sound like a question for this channel.
[09:09:12] <rcraig12> According to the jQuery website this is where the core developers reside
[09:11:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, we do.
[09:12:31] <scott_gonzalez> But this channel is about development of jQuery core.
[09:12:36] <rcraig12> The question I have is surrounding how jQuery has been developed and was hoping for some help doing similar with my library. I know its not jQuery specific in terms of enduser use but is about how jQuery has been implemented. I was kind of hoping to talk with a jQuery developer that understands the mechanics of what I am talking about to help me understand how its been done in jQuery. Sorry if the question is misplaced :)
[09:13:03] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really understand the question you're asking though.
[09:14:33] <scott_gonzalez> If you have a clear question, we can answer it.
[09:14:51] <scott_gonzalez> But the question is pretty vague.
[09:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have an example of specific code in jQuery that you don't understand?
[09:17:09] <rcraig12> jQuery.isReady is actually jQuery.extend.isReady <-- I am assuming there is some kind of mapping going on but can't work it out
[09:18:31] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery.isReady is not jQuery.extend.isReady.
[09:18:52] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery.extend() is a function which copies properties from one object to another.
[09:19:00] <scott_gonzalez> When only one object is passed, it extends jQuery.
[09:19:22] <rcraig12> ah so by passing these objects via it you are mapping to the route object
[09:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know what you mean by "the route object"
[09:19:43] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[09:19:44] <rcraig12> root
[09:19:47] <rcraig12> sorry
[09:19:50] <rcraig12> jQuery
[11:14:14] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13554 has a milestone of 1.9.2 but only landed in master.
[11:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> I assume you don't want to move then in a patch release.
[11:18:12] <DaveMethvin> yes, i wanted to land in 1.10 scott_gonzalez, afaik there won't be a 1.9.2
[11:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:56:23] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Hey, congrats on having your stamp on the front-page of GitHub blog today.
[13:56:29] <Krinkle> Watching the video now.
[13:56:57] <Krinkle> (yesterday for you I suppose)
[13:57:51] <Krinkle> Where was it recorded?
[13:58:07] <DaveMethvin> that was way back during the sf conference
[13:58:19] <DaveMethvin> we were all so much younger then :D
[13:58:24] <Krinkle> haha
[13:58:27] <DaveMethvin> june of last year
[13:59:06] <Krinkle> Eh, we've been fooled again. xD
[13:59:22] <Krinkle> Same same, but different.
[13:59:59] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: So about that gorgeous issue tracker. When are we ditching trac?
[14:00:14] <Krinkle> Couldn't help it notice.
[14:00:41] <DaveMethvin> it's good for docs issues i think, but still lacking for our code needs
[14:00:54] <DaveMethvin> i use it for jquery-migrate and still don't find it quite enough
[14:01:28] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Can you elaborate? I use it for a ton of projects and find it one of the best issue trackers I've ever used.
[14:01:50] <DaveMethvin> one example, duplicates. there's no way to easily mark dups
[14:02:05] <gf3> I don't think there's a good bug tracker out there
[14:02:13] <Krinkle> True, but one can close and leave a reference. Which automatically adds a cross-reference mention in the target issue.
[14:02:44] <DaveMethvin> trac would be good if we maintained it i think
[14:02:49] <DaveMethvin> it's just that none of us spend time on it
[14:02:52] <DaveMethvin> and it's in python
[14:02:59] <DaveMethvin> and it's got a bad schema 
[14:03:07] <DaveMethvin> but other than that... top notch
[14:03:09] <DaveMethvin> :D
[14:03:13] <gf3> Haha
[14:04:02] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: github issues has great queryability. Title, comments, assignee, @mentions, tags, milestones. And cross-issue references.
[14:04:06] <Krinkle> What else do we need?
[14:04:45] <DaveMethvin> you can see the reports we have here http://bugs.jquery.com/report
[14:05:00] <DaveMethvin> maybe those can be reprod but i am not sure
[14:05:18] <Krinkle> Afaik all of those queries can be reproduced, except for a few
[14:05:25] <Krinkle> There is no "vote" mechanism
[14:05:37] <Krinkle> but I don't like that anyway.
[14:05:59] <DaveMethvin> votes or "stars" are much better than +1 comments any day
[14:06:18] <Krinkle> Sure, but neither is fine, too.
[14:06:22] <DaveMethvin> +1 comments anger hulk DaveMethvin
[14:06:33] <Krinkle> Could be me, but I'm much more a fan of rational sorting.
[14:06:56] <DaveMethvin> but sorting by "i have this problem too" voting is very rational
[14:06:57] <Krinkle> If something is high priority it ought to get there regardless of how many people got shot.
[14:08:04] <DaveMethvin> obtw, to change the subject, did browserstack (or whatever generates the "unexpected <") come back to life?
[14:08:18] <Krinkle> sure, but does it really make sense to have "document ready should be a unique callback list" wanted by 10 people sorted above "Uncaught exception when moving element to a <table>"
[14:08:34] <DaveMethvin> i think we actually may need to ship the next 2.0 beta without having any swarmy results at all
[14:08:43] <DaveMethvin> and just tested manually from people's computers
[14:09:30] <Krinkle> I have not ever found a voting system really make a difference, add something useful  or otherwise satisfy anyone in anyway. But then again, I haven't been everywhere.
[14:10:15] <DaveMethvin> lots of activity around a subject indicates it needs to be addressed -- by core code, a plugin, documentation, a blog post, whatever
[14:10:15] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: "unexpected <" happens when server jq03 crashes. Not related to either testswarm or browserstack.
[14:10:41] <DaveMethvin> okay so it's been crashing a lot then
[14:11:07] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Unfortunately, yes. And all I can do is point to infrastructure. I have no idea.
[14:11:29] <DaveMethvin> formatting in jenkins looking janky http://wnd8.com/grab/ad64b6.png
[14:11:50] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Yes, much activity is important. But afaik it is never alone. If something is important it is important because of what it affects not because of whom or who many it affects.
[14:12:08] <Krinkle> I believe there are always other factors that will also make it rise to the top of some report.
[14:12:22] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: uh? That looks bad.
[14:12:36] <Krinkle> doesn't look like that for me
[14:12:38] <DaveMethvin> finally, something we can agree on! 
[14:12:46] <Krinkle> refresh?

[14:20:42] <DaveMethvin> dobbelt knullet
[17:02:05] <JamesMGreene> Krinkle DaveMethvin gnarf Maybe you guys can request the bare metal server that MediaTemple was offering PhantomJS (and we turned down... sigh...) ;)
[17:03:11] <nschonni1> why not try #travis, free for OSS
[17:03:48] <Krinkle> JamesMGreene: I'm not in a position to be able to do anything like that. Try gnarf ryanneufeld danheberden in #jquery-infrastructure (or on github/issues)
[17:03:48] <JamesMGreene> nschonni1: Travis doesn't let us securely store credentials [yet]
[17:04:07] <nschonni1> http://about.travis-ci.org/docs/user/encryption-keys/
[17:04:08] <Krinkle> And yes we know about the "secure" tool they have.
[17:04:16] <nschonni1> lol
[17:04:50] <Krinkle> We're already using Travis where we can.
[17:04:56] <Krinkle> Just not for everything yet
[17:04:58] <danheberden> i'm not sure where testswarm is right now, but i know we have a bigger home for it if necessary
[17:05:06] <danheberden> i'm concerned if its overrunning its bounds though
[17:05:08] <danheberden> so heavy
[17:05:45] <Krinkle> danheberden: I know its just words, but TestSwarm itself is probably the lightest part of all.
[17:05:56] <Krinkle> It's mostly Jenkins, and by extend Grunt/PhantomJS
[17:06:16] <Krinkle> TestSwarm jobs are cheap since they run in the cloud for the most part (at browserstack).
[17:06:19] <danheberden> yeah, def jenkins
[17:06:39] * danheberden looks at java and scowls

[18:32:00] <doesallmagic> richard.gibson: No ticker: grunt_compare_size options. Close gh-1210.
[20:20:38] <JamesMGreene> So assuming that jQuery is not an option, do you guys have any recommendations for event emitter libraries/mixins?  I've looked at many, basically back down to TJ Holowaychuk's component/emitter or hij1nx's EventEmitter2
[20:21:00] <JamesMGreene> I like EE2's wildcarding (I'm used to using this in other setups) but TJ's is waaaaaaaay simpler
[20:21:14] <JamesMGreene> And I don't want all of the methods on EE2... too much shit I'll never use
[21:14:35] <JamesMGreene> Nothing?
[21:15:56] <ryanneufeld> JamesMGreene: I was gonna reply to you in infra, but you left
[21:16:15] <JamesMGreene> ryanneufeld: Go for it :-P
[21:16:58] <ryanneufeld> I was gonna say, I know nothing about bare metal servers, but I'm curious why we turned it down
[21:20:56] <JamesMGreene> Well, "we" in this case is "PhantomJS"
[21:21:13] <JamesMGreene> But the turning it down part is a far more confusing tale
[21:22:13] <JamesMGreene> But you can basically boil it down to something like "We're not gonna sell out to the MAN for so little! We've got money of our own."
[21:22:30] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure I follow
[21:22:39] <JamesMGreene> ryanneufeld: Totally agree, LOL
[21:22:45] <JamesMGreene> I can't comprehend it either
[21:23:03] <JamesMGreene> But I had several team members against me, so I dropped it
[21:24:30] <JamesMGreene> TL;DR: They're not agreeable to marketing reciprocation unless we're getting more out of it (i.e. servers PLUS an employee to personally manage our build environment, e.g. Jenkins, etc., so we don't have to deal with the setup)
[21:25:44] <JamesMGreene> I can comprehend parts of it (yes, it is a pain in the ass to setup new environments) but not others (1. why would you want someone not on your team managing the build boxes? 2. why would a sponsor give you free stuff without expecting marketing reciprocation? etc.)
[21:26:23] <JamesMGreene> I wonder if they never wear any free tech T-shirts from conferences either...?
[21:28:13] <ryanneufeld> Which team is this you're talking about?
[21:28:33] <ryanneufeld> there are three teams here: Us, PhantomJS and MediaTemple
[21:35:42] <JamesMGreene> team = PhantomJS
[21:36:35] <JamesMGreene> jQuery wouldn't refuse a bare metal server in exchange for a link to the sponsor (MediaTemple, anyway!)
[21:36:42] <JamesMGreene> Or, at least, I'd assume not
[21:55:20] <ryanneufeld> okay
[21:55:30] <ryanneufeld> so how does that affect what we're doing then?
[22:04:48] <JamesMGreene> Well, more my point was that (mt) has a fantastic new bare metal server put together for PhantomJS that is going to waste
[22:04:59] <JamesMGreene> And perhaps jQuery might like to pick it up
[22:05:15] <JamesMGreene> Certainly wouldn't hurt for use with, e.g. running the builds
[22:05:41] <JamesMGreene> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/162
[22:07:34] <ryanneufeld> Ah, well, something we can talk to them about I suppose. I think gnarf, or danheberden would be the contacts on that
[22:07:48] <JamesMGreene> Right
[22:08:20] <JamesMGreene> I know they generally give jQuery whatever you guys ask for but I thought this one was worth mentioning as (mt) does not offer bare metal servers
[22:08:42] <JamesMGreene> gnarf danheberden ^
[22:36:20] <JamesMGreene> Ugh, god damn I hate file encoding
