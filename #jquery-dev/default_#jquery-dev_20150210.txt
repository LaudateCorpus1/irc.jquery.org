[05:36:25] <Becognize> i am looking to select all children of an element and the element itself according they have a specific attribute. For now i use $(this).find("[data-animation]") but i doesn't select this if it has the attribute.. how can i do that ?
[08:07:54] <scott_gonzalez> WOOHOO!!!!! GitHub wiki spam!
[08:07:56] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/SERVICE-SOLAHART-BEKASI-081905220200
[08:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> We should really not have world-editable wikis.
[08:09:24] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: mobile always has been and we have never once got spam
[08:09:35] <arschmitz> smaller target i guess
[08:09:47] <DaveMethvin> i don't see any way to make them team-only editable
[08:09:55] <arschmitz> DaveMethvin: its in the repo settings
[08:10:03] <arschmitz> Restrict editing to users in teams with push access only.
[08:10:36] <DaveMethvin> i'll turn that on
[08:11:55] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: LIES! https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Service-Solahart-Jakarta-Selatan-081905220200
[08:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is that without a custom gollum notifier, you never know when you're getting spammed.
[08:12:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah, notifications on wikis and gists suck
[08:12:31] <arschmitz> oh thats new but i guess they got us at same time
[08:13:10] <jzaefferer> okay, that sucks
[08:13:19] <jzaefferer> what can we do about https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2015---Ideas-List ?
[08:13:33] <arschmitz> google doc with team access?
[08:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: But at least GitHub provides an API for wiki notifications. They completely removed that for gists.
[08:14:09] <jzaefferer> how about a gsoc repo with just the wiki an a page 2015-Ideas-List?
[08:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> How about a gsoc repo with just a gh-pages branch?
[08:14:44] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: if we are going to do that it could just be the readme
[08:15:21] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i dont think we need an actual page i think a markdown file is probably good enough
[08:16:32] <DaveMethvin> also annoying it doesn't link the last wiki editor's github account, just the name, so it's hard to track who screwed things up or report them
[08:19:07] <jzaefferer> I think I'll stick with a wiki page for now. I'll create a gsoc repo, with just the wiki, one page for the 2015-Ideas-List and a link to that in the readme
[08:19:43] <jzaefferer> I can give access as needed and we can expand this later, also as needed
[08:28:47] <jzaefferer> There: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List
[08:28:57] <arthurvr> Thanks jzaefferer!

[20:01:58] <Krinkle> Hm.. does anyone know of a good pattern to use when it comes to providing promise-like objects that have an abort method? I find myself (and others) essentially constantly having to tack on a ".promise({abort: p.abort})" on to every ajax-related p.then() returning method.
