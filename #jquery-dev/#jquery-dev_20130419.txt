[00:28:40] <webpro> just wondering: how to get that 10KB build of v2.0? I can "only" get it to 14KB when excluding all optional modules and gzip that minified build
[00:32:21] <Krinkle> gnarf: I've updated MediaWiki git clone to latest upstream master and ran update.php
[00:32:22] <Krinkle> gnarf: http://stage.docs.jquery.com/Special:PrefixIndex/Base/
[00:32:31] <Krinkle> redirects are now listed in italics and green.
[00:32:58] <Krinkle> (the mediawiki update added those classes in the html, the docs.jq repo update added the css to style them)
[00:33:14] <Krinkle> just fyi :)
[00:33:38] <Krinkle> .. and now in prod as well
[00:34:56] <Krinkle> http://docs.jquery.com/Special:PrefixIndex?namespace=0
[00:35:45] <Krinkle> form fields look ugly because our custom skin doesn't contain many of the modules most skins made after mw 1.15 should contain (this is still based on a mediawiki 1.12 install from 2006)
[00:35:55] <Krinkle> but I'm not gonna upgrade that, not worth it I think.
[00:54:22] <Krinkle> Hm... from a navigation point of view these two are weird:

[06:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Wrong dupe: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13790
[06:12:47] <DaveMethvin> damn i'm all dislexyscsx lately
[06:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: There's a cool trick with Trac duplicates.
[06:17:01] <scott_gonzalez> If you delete the original duplicate comment, then it reverts the state.
[06:17:10] <DaveMethvin> oh nice
[06:20:05] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Regarding the component prefix on commit messages:
[06:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> It serves a few purposes.
[06:20:32] <scott_gonzalez> Looking through history, you can quickly see which commits affect what portions of code.
[06:20:59] <scott_gonzalez> Generating a changelog (I don't think you look at commits, do you?), you can sort by message and get grouping.
[06:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> If you wanted to see commits against a certain area, you could git log 1.9.1... | grep component
[06:21:38] <DaveMethvin> usually i don't look at commits, this last one was unusual b/c of the 1.x/2.x mix
[06:22:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I look at commits + tickets for the changelog.
[06:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> Just to make sure.
[06:25:01] <DaveMethvin> for a file i've just done `git log -- file` to narrow it down
[08:02:52] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[09:24:49] <DaveMethvin> wow, swarmy actually worked for once ... although it was just Migrate
[09:54:48] <scott_gonzalez> gibson042: That mailmap fix looks good.
[09:55:03] <gibson042> thanks scott_gonzalez
[09:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess we should fix snover's mapping in jquery.
[09:55:42] <gibson042> yeah, looks like :)
[09:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> snover: Can you sign the CLA?
[09:56:08] <timmywil> can we do an official tweet with his email address?
[09:56:15] <timmywil> orkel: pong
[09:57:04] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, we probably want a CAA from snover.
[09:57:28] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, look at that, I already have him in my draft email for CAA requests.

[10:58:48] <jdalton> boom
[10:59:00] <gibson042> jdalton: yep, but busy for about 15m
[11:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> rwaldron: Have you played with web components yet? Or are you just following the threads?
[11:45:31] <_JamesMGreene> oddly enough ,the jQuery core 1.7.1 release is missing from https://jquery.org/history/
[11:46:06] <_JamesMGreene> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/21/jquery-1-7-1-released/
[11:47:02] <DaveMethvin> the history page isn't every release
[11:47:19] <DaveMethvin> that's what the blog indexes are for
[11:48:02] <JamesMGreene> Well, it seems to have most all of them...?
[11:49:22] <DaveMethvin> since UI has like two dozen releases per minor they'd spam that list! :)
[11:49:53] <DaveMethvin> really it would be better if that page was true highlights
[11:50:01] <DaveMethvin> i put it together as a placeholder
[11:50:16] <ryanneufeld> great job on 2.0
[11:50:25] <DaveMethvin> thanks ryanneufeld
[12:14:12] <webpro> just wondering: how do you guys get that 10KB build of v2.0? I can "only" get it to 14KB when excluding all optional modules and gzip that minified build
[12:14:51] <DaveMethvin> sounds like you still have Sizzle in there
[12:15:07] <DaveMethvin> what does your grunt command look like?
[12:15:20] <webpro> i tried with exactly the command as on github readme
[12:16:09] <webpro> also tried with an extra "-wrap"
[12:16:17] <DaveMethvin> yeah that is missing
[12:16:18] <webpro> which saved some bytes
[12:16:30] <webpro> but still 14KB after gzip
[12:16:53] <jdalton> soo the small 10kb size of jq actually has less functionality than zepto
[12:16:53] <DaveMethvin> take the whole list from above and add it
[12:17:06] <DaveMethvin> is that bad?
[12:17:08] <jdalton> is that being tweaked to make the modules produce a build that can squash that
[12:17:34] <DaveMethvin> the thing is, the apis that are left actually work to the jquery docs
[12:17:38] <DaveMethvin> that's not true of the zepto ones
[12:17:43] <jdalton> true
[12:17:54] <jdalton> so maybe less, but more compat
[12:17:54] <DaveMethvin> except if you remove sizzle
[12:18:01] <DaveMethvin> it all depends on what you need
[12:18:03] <webpro> except for "wrap" it's all there (assuming "ajax" covers ajax/* as well)
[12:18:12] <jdalton> also does the jq qsa selector fix the  qsa behavior 
[12:18:15] <DaveMethvin> it shoud webpro
[12:18:19] <jdalton> (the old schoolissue with qsa?)
[12:18:22] <DaveMethvin> jdalton nope
[12:18:27] <jdalton> dang
[12:18:34] <DaveMethvin> but it's smaller!
[12:18:36] <jdalton> zepto doesnt either
[12:18:47] <DaveMethvin> they didn't even know about it until a month ago
[12:18:48] <jdalton> was wanting to point people to jq for consistent output
[12:19:05] <DaveMethvin> the bytes are there in jquery for a reason
[12:19:15] <DaveMethvin> i know people want it to be 0kb and have all functionality
[12:19:29] <jdalton> i'd be ok if the qsa fallback fixed the behavior
[12:19:34] <jdalton> is wut i;m saying
[12:19:41] <DaveMethvin> sure, but that's more bytes
[12:19:44] <webpro> DaveMethvin: not trying to criticize or anything, just wondering I was missing something :-)
[12:19:57] <DaveMethvin> webpro sure, yeah, it should really be that small
[12:20:04] <jdalton> right but its right functionality vs broken functionality
[12:20:08] <jdalton> so your small but broken
[12:20:13] <jdalton> so its a bug really
[12:20:22] <jdalton> its like being fast, but producing the wrong output
[12:20:26] <DaveMethvin> a bug that people can choose
[12:20:35] <jdalton> ya, that's a good point
[12:20:49] <DaveMethvin> the whole custom build thing is about tradeoffs
[12:20:49] <jdalton> maybe add it to the disclaimer, not sure if I saw that in its very thorough disclaimer
[12:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> jdalton: native = bugs
[12:21:11] <scott_gonzalez> That's why jQuery exists...
[12:21:12] <jdalton> i know, i helped write a selector engine :P
[12:21:19] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/selector-native.js#L7
[12:21:41] <DaveMethvin> i mentioned it when we announced the feature in the last beta too
[12:21:57] <DaveMethvin> the funny thing is jdalton, a lot of people only use trivial selectors
[12:22:23] <DaveMethvin> they'll prob be more upset that :input is missing, sad as that is
[12:22:48] <DaveMethvin> than the fact that leading combinators or context-rooted matches don't work
[12:23:24] <DaveMethvin> and xml selection is really messed up
[12:23:40] <DaveMethvin> but again a lot of ppl are using json now
[12:23:58] <jdalton> querySelectorAll bug fixes (e.g., unreliable :focus on WebKit) <-
[12:24:07] <jdalton> should mention the mother of all qsa behavior wtf's
[12:24:13] <jdalton> the one covered in resigs post
[12:24:24] <DaveMethvin> L16-17
[12:24:49] <jdalton> not the same
[12:25:34] <DaveMethvin> thhttp://ejohn.org/blog/thoughts-on-queryselectorall/
[12:25:37] <jdalton> http://ejohn.org/blog/thoughts-on-queryselectorall/
[12:25:38] <DaveMethvin> that one? rooted queries?
[12:25:41] <jdalton> ya
[12:25:51] <jdalton> :scope'd
[12:26:06] <jdalton> before that existed
[12:26:08] <DaveMethvin> that's what L17 is saying
[12:26:09] <jdalton> :P
[12:26:16] <DaveMethvin> $div is the scope
[12:26:17] <webpro> fwiw, including sizzle is +6KB min/gzip'd
[12:26:24] <DaveMethvin> webpro yep
[12:26:59] <jdalton> ah yes the example is good, the wording threw me off
[12:27:25] <scott_gonzalez> 6KB of sane selectors :-)
[12:27:25] <m_gol> the map file name in the minified file is wrong :( :( :(
[12:27:32] <jdalton> "all parts of a selector" made me think of the partial selectors "> div"
[12:27:40] <m_gol> we *really* need this name fix to be automated
[12:27:43] <DaveMethvin> m_gol in google? yep they renamed
[12:27:45] <jdalton> which is the note below
[12:27:50] <m_gol> in code.jquery.com, too
[12:27:56] <DaveMethvin> m_gol the build will fix it
[12:27:57] <m_gol> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.0.min.js
[12:28:15] <DaveMethvin> aarrgh
[12:28:32] <DaveMethvin> the problem is that renaming is no longer mv, it involves editing the guts of the file
[12:28:42] <timmywil> jdalton: you can't fix qsa bugs w/o a selector engines
[12:28:45] <timmywil> engine*
[12:28:58] <jdalton> lol wat
[12:29:00] <timmywil> what's in there is just a wrapper around native
[12:29:38] <timmywil> sure, you could throw out custom selectors, but you still need to parse the selector and then you've got a selector engine
[12:29:47] <m_gol> <dreamy>one day we'll have find & findAll and selector-native will be actually useful
[12:29:50] <m_gol> </dreamy>
[12:30:41] <DaveMethvin> as soon as you have to patch any of that your're pretty much into parsing the whole thing
[12:30:45] <m_gol> I was wrong that there's an error in Google CDN's jQuery
[12:30:46] <DaveMethvin> or dealing with all sorts of special cases
[12:30:58] <m_gol> since they're not using numbers in jQuery names
[12:30:59] <DaveMethvin> m_gol no, you were right, they fixed it tho
[12:31:07] <m_gol> it's more like 2.0/jquery.min.js
[12:31:17] <m_gol> oh, was it different before?
[12:31:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:31:40] <m_gol> nice
[12:31:48] <m_gol> maybe we should do the same for code.jquery.com
[12:31:55] <DaveMethvin> yeah i will
[12:32:09] <m_gol> if we just had code.jquery.com/version/jquery.js, all that map naming problems will be gone
[12:32:21] <m_gol> and we're human, we'll always keep forgetting about the rename...
[12:32:27] <DaveMethvin> until someone renames the file locally
[12:32:38] <m_gol> yes
[12:32:48] <m_gol> but we cannot do anything in such a case :)
[12:32:54] <DaveMethvin> i really wish it would just default to a .map in the same dir if there was no name in the min
[12:32:59] <m_gol> yeah!
[12:33:02] <DaveMethvin> all we need is a convention
[12:33:08] <m_gol> maybe another post on the group is needed
[12:33:38] <DaveMethvin> i tried to follow up on his question and it kept giving me an error 
[12:33:52] <DaveMethvin> basically i don't think a lot of ppl are using sourcemap now
[12:33:56] <DaveMethvin> we are prob the biggest by far
[12:34:13] <DaveMethvin> the fact that nobody came across the ie prob tells you how little it's used on the web at least
[12:34:23] <m_gol> btw, my thread seems kind of dead recently: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap/4uo7Z5nTfUY
[12:34:45] <jdalton> lets go deeper
[12:34:47] <m_gol> yeah
[12:34:53] <jdalton> qsa wrapper can be smaller
[12:34:54] <jdalton> http://caniuse.com/matchesselector
[12:34:58] <jdalton> MOAR
[12:35:04] <jdalton> SMALLSER
[12:35:16] <DaveMethvin> hey jdalton patchwelcome!
[12:35:25] <jdalton> shut yo mouth
[12:35:30] <DaveMethvin> lol
[12:35:37] <jdalton> haha
[12:36:01] <m_gol> I replied to them, I don't think the problem is that you need those extra bytes, the problem is few lib authors will stumble upon the conditional compilation problem themselves, it's their users that will have this problem for no apparent reason
[12:36:28] <DaveMethvin> yes
[12:36:29] <m_gol> qsa-native wrapper uses matchesSelector now, actually
[12:36:33] <timmywil> jdalton: I'm not sure what you're indicating. matchesSelector is used
[12:36:59] <timmywil> oh, matches
[12:37:03] <timmywil> yea
[12:37:07] <timmywil> we could look into that
[12:37:41] <m_gol> jdalton: what we need is this: http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors-api2/#interface-definitions
[12:37:46] <DaveMethvin> webpro: here's my build: http://wnd8.com/grab/36be19.png
[12:37:51] <timmywil> buuuuttt, it doesn't have enough support
[12:37:54] <m_gol> well, nothing implements matches so far
[12:37:54] <m_gol> so
[12:37:55] <timmywil> despite that table
[12:38:05] <m_gol> that table is for all versions of the spec
[12:38:07] <DaveMethvin> 9273 bytes
[12:38:31] <m_gol> that's actually what prompted me to report the pull request about renaming which was wrong as it was pointed to me
[12:38:33] <timmywil> it's confusing matches vs prefixed matchesSelector( where only the former supports :scope-style contextual matching, iirc)
[12:38:37] <m_gol> the caniuse page
[12:38:47] <DaveMethvin> timmywil right
[12:38:55] <m_gol> they're confusing it because it's the same spec with different versions
[12:38:59] <DaveMethvin> they have diff semantics
[12:39:08] <m_gol> and their policy is to squash them
[12:39:30] <timmywil> well, it doesn't help us regardless
[12:39:34] <m_gol> yep
[12:40:33] <m_gol> oh, they replied, it just went to a different thread, weirdly: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap/aMf0srvZmoM
[12:41:55] <snover> DaveMethvin: cyber?
[12:42:17] <DaveMethvin> snover cyber?
[12:42:27] <snover> just say yes!
[12:42:42] <snover> i say yes
[12:42:43] <snover> ok
[12:42:44] <DaveMethvin> cyber? I hardly knew her?
[12:42:44] <snover> we’re doing it
[12:45:00] <webpro> DaveMethvin: thanks, so your grunt task is just "custom"? since i'm not getting that (pre-)uglify:all stuff, and also not auto-gzip
[12:45:28] <DaveMethvin> i just copy/pasted from the readme and added -wrap webpro
[12:45:50] <webpro> DaveMethvin: then we're on different version, i'll try latest
[12:46:03] <DaveMethvin> you may be on 1.9.1 then webpro
[12:46:12] <DaveMethvin> which would be about right
[12:46:25] <webpro> no, def not
[12:46:27] <webpro> 2.0
[12:46:38] <DaveMethvin> mine was just pulled from master
[12:46:54] <DaveMethvin> and it's been below 10k for at least a week or two
[12:50:47] <webpro> DaveMethvin: this is werid then, i did fresh clone of "version": "2.0.1-pre"
[12:50:50] <webpro> weird
[12:50:58] <webpro> still same (14K)
[12:51:25] <DaveMethvin> what's your screen shot like?
[12:51:43] <webpro> oh wait.. the 41306 minified is the same
[12:51:59] <webpro> i run gzip -9 on the jquery.min.js myself
[12:52:01] <DaveMethvin> you need a better gzipper webpro :D
[12:52:08] <webpro> exactly...
[12:52:49] <webpro> that's a big diff… i use default zip on osx
[12:53:15] <DaveMethvin> i think the settings we use are the std web server ones
[12:54:47] <webpro> I wonder… gzip = require("gzip-js")
[12:54:57] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: I submitted the proposal: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/mozilla.dev.js-sourcemap/rIt4kvlC6GI
[12:55:18] <m_gol> TBH this group doesn't seem to have enormous activity...
[12:55:44] <DaveMethvin> as long as it has the people doing the impl, that's all we need :)
[12:57:32] <m_gol> :)
[12:57:49] <m_gol> it's the lack of feedback that worries me
[12:58:03] <m_gol> I have a feeling I'm the only one giving feedback there ;D
[12:59:26] <m_gol> haha, regarding 2.0 comments: people seem to have an impression that 95% of jQuery 1.x code size is for oldIE
[12:59:36] <DaveMethvin> yes
[12:59:38] <webpro> DaveMethvin: when I load it up with my default nginx settings it's 16.5KB.. so 10KB is with gzip-js but not default (unix-y).. and now I'll stop about it :-D
[12:59:44] <m_gol> and they're surprised 2.0 is "only" 12% smaller
[13:00:06] <DaveMethvin> webpro well at least i have a screen shot proving what I got :D
[13:00:11] <m_gol> ;)
[13:00:12] <DaveMethvin> SO THERE!
[13:00:31] <snover> webpro: did you set gzip_comp_level 9; ?
[13:00:43] <webpro> DaveMethvin: I can give you screenshots of actual real-world situations ;-)
[13:00:47] <snover> it kind of defaults to 1
[13:00:49] <webpro> yes -9
[13:00:52] <m_gol> they should just try Zepto and maybe they'll understand it's not only about oldIE ;)
[13:01:12] <webpro> also nginx is like -6 or so
[13:01:18] <DaveMethvin> oh that's the problem, you shoudl use kill -9 and not gzip -9 !
[13:01:23] <DaveMethvin> ;)
[13:01:25] <m_gol> :D
[13:02:08] <webpro> lol
[13:02:13] <snover> no. nginx, by default, is 1.
[13:02:15] <snover> not 6t.
[13:02:16] <snover> 1.
[13:02:19] <m_gol> haha, just looked to the Zepto 1.0 code
[13:02:21] <m_gol>   // for now
[13:02:21] <m_gol>   $.fn.detach = $.fn.remove
[13:02:50] <DaveMethvin> there's no way for them to know what events are attached, they don't track it i think
[13:02:57] <m_gol> yeah
[13:02:57] <DaveMethvin> it's bare addEventListener
[13:03:15] <m_gol> this seems to be a looooong "now" ;)
[13:03:49] <DaveMethvin> i'm not letting you read my other project's comments m_gol
[13:03:51] <DaveMethvin> :D
[13:03:57] <m_gol> :D
[13:04:12] <webpro> snover: might be, but i'm mostly talking about zip on my osx
[13:06:41] <m_gol> ok, enough, this code is hard to read
[13:06:55] <m_gol> just like Backbone's & underscore's
[13:07:08] <DaveMethvin> let me help:   ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
[13:07:11] <DaveMethvin> that should be enough
[13:07:19] <m_gol> I've tried lodash recently and was in love with the code style change from looking at underscore...
[13:07:25] <m_gol> DaveMethvin :D
[13:07:41] <m_gol> well, they do have a few
[13:07:48] <m_gol> at the begginning of lines ;)
[13:09:32] <webpro> lol, with nginx gzip -9 i get 14.3KB
[13:09:52] <webpro> anybody wants a screenshot? :-p
[13:09:53] <DaveMethvin> well CLEARLY i have a SUPERIOR gzip
[13:10:31] <webpro> gzip-js doesn't look what most webservers use to me
[13:11:53] <m_gol> webpro, what size do you get on the whole minified file with your zip?
[13:11:58] <DaveMethvin> well our numbers are really close to what is here: http://mathiasbynens.be/demo/jquery-size
[13:12:17] <DaveMethvin> the last column is zopfli which most ppl don't use, ignore that one
[13:13:06] <webpro> gzip -9 > 14215 bytes
[13:13:26] <m_gol> webro, can you try the full build?
[13:13:34] <m_gol> * webpro
[13:13:51] <webpro> "webbro" is fine too :D lol
[13:14:00] <m_gol> :D
[13:14:54] <webpro> jquery.min is 83103 and after gzip -9 it's 28939
[13:15:11] <webpro> after just "grunt"
[13:15:29] <DaveMethvin> lemme do a run here
[13:15:54] <webpro> (just pulled from master btw)
[13:16:06] <DaveMethvin> 29030 dist/jquery.min.js
[13:16:35] <webpro> DaveMethvin: -9?
[13:16:41] <m_gol> gzip -9 dist/jquery.min.js gives 28939b for me
[13:16:45] <m_gol> on OS X 10.8.3
[13:16:46] <DaveMethvin> just the min task
[13:16:58] <webpro> i'm on osx as well
[13:16:58] <DaveMethvin> i'm on Windows with msysgit
[13:17:07] <DaveMethvin> well mine is bigger
[13:17:12] <jdalton> timmywil yay
[13:17:30] <webpro> it's 91 bytes diff
[13:17:32] <DaveMethvin> so i dunno why the custom build would be so diff for you
[13:17:33] <m_gol> jdalton, thx for lodash <3
[13:17:48] <m_gol> hah, weird
[13:18:36] <webpro> m_gol: how about your custom build?
[13:18:40] <timmywil> jdalton: :)
[13:19:15] <m_gol> sorry, didn't have latest master, updating...
[13:29:42] <m_gol> full: 28939, minimal: 14215
[13:29:45] <m_gol> hah, weird
[13:29:55] <DaveMethvin> very
[13:30:08] <m_gol> (this is from manual gzip -9 on OS X)
[13:30:13] <DaveMethvin> your full sized is smaller, my custom is smaller
[13:31:40] <webpro> well at least I'm not alone :D
[13:31:52] <jdalton> heads up
[13:31:58] <jdalton> http://jsperf.com/jquery-1-9-1-vs-2-0-0-beta/4
[13:32:07] <DaveMethvin> m_gol webpro if you bros need anything compressed let me know
[13:32:08] <DaveMethvin> :D
[13:32:39] <m_gol> ;)
[13:33:05] <DaveMethvin> jdalton hmmm
[13:33:30] <jdalton> i havent looked at it yet, or like, added more browser attempts
[13:33:41] <DaveMethvin> i didn't have any extensive tests but the only thing i saw that had regressed at all was the new data impl on chrome...but it was faster on ff as i recall
[13:34:00] <DaveMethvin> i bugged rwaldron and he tweaked it a coupla days ago
[13:34:30] <m_gol> hmm
[13:34:36] <m_gol> jdalton, this is more up to date: http://jsperf.com/jquery-1-9-1-vs-2-0-0-beta/5
[13:34:45] <m_gol> but still, 2.x is slower on the same Sizzle build, weird
[13:34:50] <m_gol> on Chrome
[13:35:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah a big diff
[13:35:37] <m_gol> it's slower in Fx, too, just not so much
[13:38:07] <DaveMethvin> chrome is faster, but more fidgety it seems
[13:38:24] <jdalton> ok cool
[13:38:47] <jdalton> real heads up
[13:38:48] <jdalton> http://blog.mindedsecurity.com/2013/04/jquery-migrate-is-sink-too.html
[13:38:53] <DaveMethvin> jdalton i'd love to have a good set of regression tests for perf
[13:39:10] <jdalton> "How 'jQuery Migrate' un-fixes a nasty DOMXSS without telling us" by @WisecWisec and me, enjoy! bit.ly/11mtQPH
[13:39:22] <jdalton> saw this come across my feed
[13:39:34] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, probably does
[13:39:40] <DaveMethvin> so much for RESPONSIBLE DISCLOSURE
[13:39:58] <m_gol> why does jquery.com use migrate? does it contain some old code?
[13:40:08] <DaveMethvin> probably laziness
[13:40:16] <DaveMethvin> i dunno
[13:40:24] <DaveMethvin> i suspect a plugin needs it
[13:40:36] <jdalton> dude
[13:40:37] <jdalton> http://html5sec.org/jquery/
[13:40:39] <DaveMethvin> but in any case we'll need to fix the XSS
[13:40:40] <jdalton> he built a checker
[13:40:46] <jdalton> that's rad
[13:40:49] <DaveMethvin> great
[13:40:54] <DaveMethvin> would have been nice to tell us
[13:40:58] <rwaldron> yeah
[13:41:02] <rwaldron> was just thinking the same thing
[13:41:12] <jdalton> ya I did too
[13:41:16] <jdalton> we are linked in the minds
[13:42:20] <DaveMethvin> I'll just add it as an issue
[14:06:31] <x00mario> Hello everyone! As an instant ice-breaker and friendship-magnet - I am the co-author of this: http://blog.mindedsecurity.com/2013/04/jquery-migrate-is-sink-too.html
[14:07:07] <DaveMethvin> wait a minute, let me get my pitchfork
[14:07:26] <x00mario> If any questions pop up, feel free to ask me or Stefano. We tried to report the bug via multiple sources but no success. security@jquery.com is not existing and the re-captcha on the tracker is broken. We tried.
[14:07:37] <x00mario> So, there you go :)
[14:07:50] <DaveMethvin> you didn't try very hard
[14:08:11] <x00mario> I don't use jQ Migrate so it was hard enough for me 
[14:08:28] <DaveMethvin> you could have easily created an issue on the tracker
[14:08:45] <DaveMethvin> even that would be less high-profile and boasty than "we found a 0-day"
[14:08:49] <x00mario> I tried, re-captcha is broken, couldn't post
[14:08:56] <DaveMethvin> that was just irresponsible
[14:09:00] <x00mario> several times today. several VMs
[14:09:09] <x00mario> nope
[14:09:33] <DaveMethvin> like i said, you could have created an issue
[14:09:40] <x00mario> it wasn't. we tried, the channels were closed. our time for endless tries is limited. no you know, fixes can be on the way.
[14:09:53] <DaveMethvin> oh so grateful
[14:10:06] <x00mario> you're welcome sir 
[14:10:11] <DaveMethvin> adios
[14:10:25] <x00mario> either way: if you do have questions let me know, will be glad to answer
[14:12:09] <x00mario> "I intentionally pulled out the XSS check in that regex, thinking it wasn't needed. Now if I could only recall WHY."
[14:12:16] <x00mario> I reckon that one contains irony?
[14:12:16] <rwaldron> x00mario, no one else has a problem filing bugs.
[14:12:33] <rwaldron> no irony, we're trying to remember why it was relaxed
[14:12:43] <x00mario> doesn't change the fact that we tried
[14:12:58] <rwaldron> I don't think you tried very hard.
[14:13:01] <DaveMethvin> i think we've got it from here, cya later
[14:13:53] <x00mario> what you think, rwaldron, is pretty much irrelevant to me. what is relevant to me is the amount of time I invest w/o success
[14:14:02] <x00mario> nevertheless I am glad you are approaching a fix now
[14:14:07] <DaveMethvin> i said good day sir
[14:14:18] <m_gol> re-captcha on github? where?
[14:14:21] <x00mario> i am not talking to you methvin
[14:14:22] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin, so, this is interesting
[14:14:42] <rwaldron> the behaviour shown here http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-icewbjf4a_I/UXF2eCWbRxI/AAAAAAAAAEA/ic0VyvusokM/s1600/jQueryBlog_alert.png
[14:14:50] <rwaldron> only happens in Firefox
[14:14:52] <x00mario> i tried to submit on bugs jq.com - then stranded here http://bugs.jquery.com/captcha
[14:14:55] <rwaldron> no dice in chrome
[14:15:00] <rwaldron> checking others
[14:15:27] <x00mario> chrome encodes the param - depending on how it's being filled
[14:16:28] <x00mario> just tested on chrome 26
[14:16:32] <rwaldron> x00mario no...
[14:16:34] <x00mario> repros as well
[14:16:42] <rwaldron> it just creates a text and svg node
[14:16:52] <x00mario> try this:
[14:16:56] <x00mario> https://jquery.org/#<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
[14:17:07] <x00mario> then $(location.hash)
[14:18:15] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ^^ that does repro
[14:18:30] <DaveMethvin> not surprising
[14:18:33] <rwaldron> x00mario why didnt you come to us here earlier?
[14:18:43] <DaveMethvin> don't get him started again rwaldron
[14:18:43] <x00mario> i didn't even know the IRC exists
[14:18:50] <x00mario> i usually don't use IRC
[14:18:51] <x00mario> and
[14:18:52] <rwaldron> dot dot dot
[14:19:05] <x00mario> why don't you have a security@jquery.com email address?
[14:19:32] <x00mario> and why is your bugtracker (bugs.jquery.com) broken?
[14:19:36] <DaveMethvin> we've have people report bugs responsibly via several other channels with no problems
[14:19:52] <x00mario> why don't you have unit and regressions tests testing for security issues?
[14:20:05] <DaveMethvin> sorry it's somehow our problem that you proudly published a 0-day on your blog 
[14:20:08] <x00mario> this is not an 0day but a re-activation of an old bug
[14:20:14] <x00mario> it's not my blog
[14:20:17] <x00mario> doofus
[14:20:28] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/search?q=xss&go=&ticket=on
[14:20:30] <DaveMethvin> okay, we;ll call you if we need something
[14:20:34] <x00mario> good
[14:20:37] <rwaldron> http://bugs.jquery.com/search?q=security&noquickjump=1&ticket=on
[14:21:05] <rwaldron> x00mario the bug tracker isn't broken
[14:21:10] <x00mario> look
[14:21:18] <rwaldron> you must be registered and logged in
[14:21:21] <x00mario> i tried several times in several ways
[14:21:26] <rwaldron> otherwise we are bombarded with spam
[14:21:32] <rwaldron> gtfo
[14:21:35] <rwaldron> seriously
[14:21:39] <x00mario> haha
[14:21:42] <x00mario> good job :)
[14:22:04] <x00mario> well - so be it. happy fixing, gents!
[14:22:13] <x00mario> you did WELL on the response. WELL!
[14:22:18] <x00mario> others can learn from you
[14:22:23] <x00mario> kthxbai
[14:22:41] <m_gol> well, that was something...
[14:22:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah he just had an excuse for everything
[14:23:13] <m_gol> "several ways"
[14:23:19] <rwaldron> Ok, so jQuery 2.x and 1.x don't have this issue
[14:23:22] <rwaldron> just migrate?
[14:23:26] <DaveMethvin> right
[14:23:32] <DaveMethvin> it's the old hole we patched in 1.7
[14:23:42] <DaveMethvin> you just don't send anything starting # into the html path
[14:23:44] <rwaldron> if people need that support, i say we let them, but it has to be UGLY optin
[14:23:46] <DaveMethvin> you send it to the selector path
[14:24:07] <DaveMethvin> o and now i remember why
[14:24:14] <rwaldron> So migrate can offer some idot switch
[14:24:30] <rwaldron> jQuery.optins = { xss: false }
[14:24:33] <DaveMethvin> originally migrate was just for 1.9+
[14:24:40] <rwaldron> set it true for xss vulnerability
[14:24:46] <DaveMethvin> but then when i made it for older versions i had to remove that
[14:24:52] <DaveMethvin> but it shoudl be easy to fix
[14:25:25] <DaveMethvin> we just need to not allow anything starting # to be seen as html
[14:25:28] <DaveMethvin> any time
[14:25:36] <rwaldron> I agree
[14:25:46] <rwaldron> how about this insane shit...
[14:26:10] <rwaldron> document.body.innerHTML = "<div id='<svg onload=alert(1)>'>hi!</div>"
[14:26:17] <rwaldron> I shit you not
[14:26:32] <rwaldron> http://gyazo.com/a9a522d9888f40538a9152f020005542
[14:26:59] <DaveMethvin> there's a reason CSP and .toStaticHTML exist
[14:27:42] <DaveMethvin> same reason i want to make "don't execute scripts and content" the default 
[14:28:20] <rwaldron> document.body.innerHTML = "<div id='<svg/onload=alert(1)>'>hi!</div>"; document.querySelectorAll('#\\<svg\\/onload\\=alert\\(1\\)\\>');
[14:29:03] <DaveMethvin> stuff like that is also why github is going CSP as soon as possible
[14:29:29] <rwaldron> FirefoxOS has a locked down CSP
[14:29:35] <rwaldron> no inline script or style
[14:29:41] <rwaldron> elements
[14:29:43] <DaveMethvin> just about any HTML-app env does
[14:29:49] <rwaldron> also, no inline handlers or style=""
[14:29:54] <rwaldron> i like it
[14:30:00] <DaveMethvin> same with ChromeOS, Chrome add-ons, Win8 apps, etc
[14:30:17] <DaveMethvin> of course they keep breaking our feature detects
[14:30:18] <DaveMethvin> :D
[14:30:54] <m_gol> yeah, it's a shame it's not possible to detect event presence in a different way than 'onsth' in div
[14:31:29] <DaveMethvin> supportsFeature would be nice
[14:31:31] <m_gol> especially that not all events can have handlers attached in this way
[14:31:44] <m_gol> e.g. the 'wheel' event in IE>=9
[14:31:44] <DaveMethvin> and not all elements etc
[14:32:04] <m_gol> yup
[14:33:17] <_|Nix|_> Hi! Noob question: How come :visible returns true for something that has visibility: hidden?
[14:33:28] * _|Nix|_ is trying to devise a unit test for the jQM popup ...
[14:33:35] <DaveMethvin> because it's not display:none
[14:33:41] <DaveMethvin> it's taking up space in the doc
[14:33:45] <DaveMethvin> more like camoflaged
[14:34:07] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ...
[14:34:12] <DaveMethvin> we don't consider it hidden if it's off screen or below the fold either
[14:34:22] <DaveMethvin> even though you can't see it
[14:34:24] <_|Nix|_> I know, that makes sense ...
[14:34:49] <DaveMethvin> well whether it makes sense or not, its the way it was defined in 1996 and we're staying with it :D
[14:34:49] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: ... I'm trying to devise a test for this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5892 ...
[14:34:50] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5892 by rbu (2d 11h ago): The contents of a closed popup should not appear in "find" or "copy all text"
[14:34:53] <DaveMethvin> 2006
[14:35:23] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Not sure how to perform a "find" or "select all" from a unit test ...
[14:35:45] <DaveMethvin> oh like the browser's equiv operation?
[14:35:50] <DaveMethvin> from their UI?
[14:36:16] <_|Nix|_> I don't understand your questions.
[14:36:45] <DaveMethvin> perform a "find"  ---> you mean like Ctrl-F in the browser?
[14:36:51] <_|Nix|_> Yeah.
[14:37:01] <_|Nix|_> ... and select all.
[14:37:08] <_|Nix|_> Like Ctrl+A
[14:37:08] <rwaldron> you can do neither
[14:37:15] <_|Nix|_> I thought as much.
[14:37:19] <rwaldron> well, the select maybe
[14:37:22] <rwaldron> with reanges
[14:37:23] <rwaldron> ranges*
[14:37:32] <DaveMethvin> you'd need to figure out what the browser considers eligible for those
[14:37:35] <_|Nix|_> rwaldron: Can I get the resulting text?
[14:37:40] <rwaldron> but no copy() call
[14:37:45] <rwaldron> yes
[14:37:49] <_|Nix|_> Nono ... I don't want to copy it.
[14:37:58] <_|Nix|_> I just wanna make sure certain text is not in it.
[14:38:03] <rwaldron> it's not likely to be what you think
[14:38:25] <rwaldron> $("container").text()?
[14:38:48] <rwaldron> $("body").text()
[14:39:02] <_|Nix|_> rwaldron: That's an interesting point. I wonder if these skip over visibility: hidden elements ...
[14:39:13] <rwaldron> no idea
[14:39:13] <DaveMethvin> .text() won't skip it
[14:39:23] <rwaldron> yeah, I didn't think so
[14:39:33] <DaveMethvin> createTextRange? i dunno
[14:39:38] <_|Nix|_> rwaldron: Although what I should be asking is whether these are equivalent to selecting the whole text and then checking what's been selected.
[14:39:49] <_|Nix|_> rwaldron: ... guess not :)
[14:39:50] <rwaldron> (moments after saying "no idea", it occurred to me that text() would get everything all the time)
[14:40:09] <rwaldron> What are you trying to test?
[14:40:19] <_|Nix|_> rwaldron: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5892
[14:40:20] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5892 by rbu (2d 11h ago): The contents of a closed popup should not appear in "find" or "copy all text"
[14:40:32] <rwaldron> um
[14:40:55] <_|Nix|_> rwaldron: I can test it manually easily enough ...
[14:41:08] <rwaldron> the OP is right
[14:41:12] <_|Nix|_> rwaldron: ... but a programmatic test would be nice.
[14:41:17] <rwaldron> are these things just moved off screen?
[14:41:21] <rwaldron> it's possible
[14:41:35] <rwaldron> one sec
[14:41:42] <_|Nix|_> rwaldron: They're moved off-screen.
[14:41:58] <DaveMethvin> yeah then ctrl-a will select them
[14:42:04] <DaveMethvin> just like below the fold
[14:42:09] <_|Nix|_> rwaldron: I had code in place for making them display: none, but that's ugly, because you gotta turn that back off ...
[14:42:19] <_|Nix|_> ... when making calculations.
[14:42:25] <DaveMethvin> dunno about visibility being changed
[14:42:48] <_|Nix|_> visibility: hidden will cause Ctrl+A to not select the text inside the popup in the latest Chrome.
[14:42:54] <_|Nix|_> I've tested that manually.
[14:43:09] <DaveMethvin> so is that the right solution then?
[14:43:26] <DaveMethvin> or is there a drawback?
[14:43:46] <DaveMethvin> it should be nice that it doesn't (need to) cause a reflow when you toggle
[14:43:49] <_|Nix|_> It seems to be, but I cannot devise a test to make sure that in future versions, the text of a closed popup is not included in Ctrl+A.
[14:43:52] <DaveMethvin> only for the area being toggled
[14:44:00] <DaveMethvin> aaaaahh
[14:44:03] <rwaldron> so, the way to programmatically guarantee no control-f finding is to display:none, that's all there is to it
[14:44:20] <DaveMethvin> or visibility too?
[14:44:46] <rwaldron> yes
[14:45:01] <DaveMethvin> i think as long as you have the unit test check that the dialog is visibility:hidden that shoudl be fine _|Nix|_
[14:45:12] * rwaldron nods
[14:45:16] <rwaldron> bbiaf
[14:45:46] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... I was kinda hoping to make the test implementation agnostic ... but I guess I can't.
[14:47:20] <DaveMethvin> what a meticulous test writer! you'll never get anywhere that way, son! :D
[14:47:25] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:49:11] <_|Nix|_> I always considered unit tests pointless, because it's like, I just tested it - it works. I understand now that they're not pointless because once written, they'll make sure it keeps working. Still, if the test is tied to the implem, any change in the implem will almost certainly require a change in the test. That's why it's best to test from an independent angle.
[14:49:20] <_|Nix|_> But anyway ... I digress ...
[14:50:37] <_|Nix|_> Thanks for your help!
[15:01:28] <rwaldron> _|Nix|_ +1
[15:01:35] <rwaldron> (to unit tests ftw)
[15:11:34] <m_gol> is there any way to determine what we need the migrate plugin on jQuery sites for?
[15:12:04] <m_gol> I'd like to fix plugins requiring old stuff but I'd need a way to detect which ones break
[15:12:20] <rwaldron> is anyone from infrastructure around?
[15:12:21] <m_gol> and the base is shared by lots of jQuery sites
[15:12:46] <rwaldron> ajpiano ping?
[15:38:01] <m_gol> rwaldron, did you see? http://jsperf.com/jquery-1-9-1-vs-2-0-0-beta/5
[15:38:19] <m_gol> we have a regression
[15:38:40] <rwaldron> yeah, earlier I made a version of this with just data to make sure it wasn't there
[15:38:44] <rwaldron> (it's not)
[15:38:50] * rwaldron sigh of relief
[15:39:51] <m_gol> :)
[15:46:06] <rwaldron> weird
[15:46:40] <rwaldron> why is that jquery-git2.js showing the slightly slower version of cleanData?
[15:47:28] <rwaldron> did I not land that code?
[15:48:11] <m_gol> well, I see the same code on master
[15:49:22] <rwaldron> yeah
[15:49:23] <rwaldron> weird
[15:49:25] <rwaldron> haha
[15:49:32] <rwaldron> I guess I never merged it
[15:49:42] <m_gol> 2.0.1 it is! ;)
[15:50:07] <m_gol> is this the reason?
[16:27:42] <jdalton> dudes
[16:27:50] <jdalton> just read the backlog
[16:27:53] <jdalton> (was in a meeting)
[16:44:46] <jdalton> at least there is a handy test page amiright
[16:44:55] <jdalton> that's almost like contributing a unit test
[19:58:17] <JamesMGreene> So regarding the earlier, uhh, "conversation" with x00mario: who the fuck does `$(location.hash)`?
[20:01:03] <DaveMethvin> JamesMGreene: it's used when the hash is a reference to an id on the page
[20:01:24] <DaveMethvin> and of course it's REALLY bad practice
[20:04:20] <JamesMGreene> Oh, I guess
