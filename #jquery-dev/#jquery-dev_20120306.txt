[04:57:42] <jaubourg> so I missed a lot of fun it seems
[04:57:43] <bot-t> (260 hours ago) <ajpiano> tell jaubourg can you give this a once-over and see if it actually seems like something we should fix
[04:57:43] <bot-t> (260 hours ago) <ajpiano> tell jaubourg https://gist.github.com/1901919
[04:59:42] <jaubourg> ?tell ajpiano late on the party but a specific IE8 fix that cannot be feature tested? Errr...
[04:59:43] <bot-t> jaubourg, Okay.
[06:31:12] <jaubourg> hey Dave
[06:41:11] <jaubourg> hey timmy
[06:42:08] <jaubourg> damn, I'm no used to IRC anymore :/
[06:43:39] <DaveMethvin> we still love you jaubourg
[06:58:40] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin include_js.php is a horrible nightmare
[06:59:09] <rwaldron> Also, I'm not sure that doc fragment stuff had anything to do with regressions in FF3.6
[06:59:26] <DaveMethvin> oh ok ... any ideas what is going on there?
[06:59:34] <rwaldron> http://gyazo.com/83ae86f306e167c7597859b818918c11
[06:59:39] <rwaldron> TBH, not sure yet
[06:59:43] <rwaldron> debugging is a bitch
[07:00:00] <rwaldron> because includde_js.php doesn't give me per-file line numbers like we used to have
[07:00:05] <DaveMethvin> right, i had a link to a really simple case in fiddle tho
[07:00:11] <rwaldron> core.js line:30 ext...
[07:00:19] <rwaldron> I didnt see that?
[07:00:28] <rwaldron> i read it on my mobile
[07:00:35] <rwaldron> and then just fired up FF3.6
[07:00:56] <rwaldron> and then got sidetracked because browserstack FF3.6 doesnt have firebug installed
[07:01:01] <rwaldron> let me just start over.
[07:01:05] <rwaldron> i'll get back to you.
[07:01:08] <rwaldron> ;)
[07:01:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah i went thru all that too rwaldron
[07:01:31] <DaveMethvin> it's a very strange bug
[07:01:39] <DaveMethvin> i was just exhausted last night
[07:01:56] <DaveMethvin> but here's the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/79gBB/1/
[07:02:05] <DaveMethvin> that eliminates the test env as a suspect
[07:02:18] <rwaldron> i'm looking at it now
[07:02:27] <rwaldron> sorry, i'm a bit flaky in the AM.
[07:03:42] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin ok, this is easy
[07:03:46] <rwaldron> patch coming
[07:03:53] <DaveMethvin> oh good!
[07:04:20] <rwaldron> issue: if (safeChildNodes.length - 1) results in -1, FF 3.6 dies
[07:04:24] <rwaldron> so, we'll guard against it
[07:05:16] <rwaldron> at least that's my initial diagnosis
[07:22:26] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: nice being around at least ;)
[07:22:41] <jaubourg> rwaldron: hello man :)
[07:23:14] <DaveMethvin> back in about 20 minutes, the dog needs walking
[07:23:21] <rwaldron> jaubourg *hugs* ^5
[07:23:26] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin when you get back
[07:23:34] <rwaldron> ping me
[08:02:00] <DaveMethvin> ping rwaldron
[08:03:11] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin one sec
[08:03:16] <DaveMethvin> sho
[08:09:16] <rwaldron> back
[08:09:22] <rwaldron> so...
[08:09:34] <rwaldron> used your fiddle as a unit test
[08:09:43] <rwaldron> the patch was simple
[08:10:03] <rwaldron> just check the length before assuming something is there for removal
[08:10:50] <rwaldron> tested in: ie6,7,8; firefox 3.6,10; chrome 16,17; opera 11.something or other
[08:11:00] <rwaldron> and i actually forgot to test in safari
[08:20:43] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin yt?
[08:20:48] <DaveMethvin> just a sec
[08:21:00] <rwaldron> oh, no worries
[08:57:12] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: We need to have a talk about Touch/MSPointer. I've got some TODOs from the W3C :-)
[09:02:45] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: so that was a long sec
[09:15:15] <rwaldron> hahaha
[09:15:17] <rwaldron> no worries

[10:09:27] <DaveMethvin> hey whatchoo talking about miketaylr, i watch what I eat and have lost 5 pounds since the holidays! :D
[10:09:33] <miketaylr> :)~
[10:10:21] <ajpiano> miketaylr: the only thing DaveMethvin is blowing up is the size of jquery
[10:10:29] <ajpiano> now that he is personally responsible for twitter's slow load time
[10:10:37] <ajpiano> and all the other problems on the web
[10:10:50] <ajpiano> i heard he hacked github and committed on rails from the future
[10:10:52] <miketaylr> so when do you guys start minting currency?
[10:11:15] <miketaylr> and when do you finish JohnResig's book?
[10:11:41] <DaveMethvin> jQuery is NOT bloated, its API is pleasingly plump

[14:56:24] <DaveMethvin> normally i'm against the taunting of any being, but since this is Jenkins i'll make an exception
[14:58:30] <johnbender> sorry about the spam
[14:58:32] <johnbender> should be sorted
[15:09:18] <johnbender> jzaefferer: danheberden: can we eliminate some of the out of memory exceptions by limiting jenkins to one executor?
[15:09:25] <johnbender> well
[15:09:30] <johnbender> let me rephrase
[15:09:59] <johnbender> can we *try* to eliminate some of the oom exceptions by limiting our jenkins instance to one executor?
[15:10:47] <danheberden> johnbender you're welcome to fiddle with what you'd like on it bro
[15:11:13] <johnbender> alright, there's obviously the possible issue with things getting backed up which is why I wanted to include some folks just in case someone complains
[15:11:47] <danheberden> if you could back up the db first, that'd be sweet
[15:13:33] <johnbender> danheberden: I've never done that before :(
[15:13:43] <eddiemonge> you dont like db's being accidently erased?
[15:14:59] <johnbender> I assume you mean the jenkins config db

[17:02:09] <DaveMethvin> oh jenkins, how do you feel about this commit?
[17:44:41] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin hey there
[17:44:52] <DaveMethvin> hey rwaldron
[17:45:13] <rwaldron> do you happen to have any particularly interesting windows phone devices?
[17:45:32] <DaveMethvin> i don't have any here ... wycats has one tho
[17:45:57] <DaveMethvin> i have one of those windows 8 tablets but that's like real windows
[17:46:02] <rwaldron> ooooo
[17:46:05] <rwaldron> that might be awesome too
[17:46:15] <rwaldron> what IE does it have?
[17:46:19] <DaveMethvin> ie10
[17:46:22] <DaveMethvin> pretty decent
[17:46:24] <rwaldron> neat
[17:46:43] <DaveMethvin> and works with touch, altho the don't have the webkit touch events
[17:46:51] <DaveMethvin> the shit's bout ready to hit the fan about that i think
[17:46:55] <rwaldron> if you have a chance, could you snap a picture of the results of http://rng.io and send it to me?
[17:46:56] <DaveMethvin> apple wont' give up their patents
[17:47:04] <DaveMethvin> sure
[17:47:10] <rwaldron> http://weblog.bocoup.com/ringmark-gallery-pt1/
[17:47:18] <rwaldron> i need more tablets for part 2
[17:47:50] <DaveMethvin> so going back a decade ... is ie6/7 still crashing on you with master?
[17:48:15] <rwaldron> i havent checked today
[17:48:22] <rwaldron> i was busy with Popcorn 1.2 release
[17:48:32] <DaveMethvin> howd it go?
[17:48:36] <rwaldron> i think it was a browserstack issue
[17:48:44] <rwaldron> oh not released yet
[17:48:50] <DaveMethvin> these "testing tools" are gonna kill us eventually
[17:48:51] <rwaldron> we're doing final round of testing
[17:49:00] <rwaldron> and plugging any IE9 leaks
[17:49:06] <rwaldron> anndddd
[17:49:23] <rwaldron> we wrote a shim to support using youtube on ie8
[17:49:41] <rwaldron> it doesnt ship with the core library
[17:49:49] <DaveMethvin> some kinda flash ting?
[17:50:04] <rwaldron> but you'll be able to roll it into a build with our web builder thingy
[17:50:16] <rwaldron> naw, just the same old youtube "player" plugin
[17:50:35] <rwaldron> we just wrote the nec. garbage code to make addEventListener work in ie8 and junk like that
[17:50:44] <DaveMethvin> oh oh
[17:50:45] <DaveMethvin> ok
[17:53:40] <rwaldron> I'm about to use coconut oil to saute steak
[17:53:48] <rwaldron> i think it's gonna be awesome
[17:53:53] <DaveMethvin> never heard of that
[17:54:10] <rwaldron> neither have i
[17:55:21] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: http://imgur.com/TzDKv
[17:55:32] <DaveMethvin> that's the tablet running ie10
[17:57:48] <rwaldron> yeesh
[17:58:04] <rwaldron> gonna be a long two years for winphone users
[17:58:07] <rwaldron> or 3...
[17:58:14] <DaveMethvin> so rwaldron, regarding the touch event stuff in rng.io, we should talk some time about the shitstorm about to break there
[17:58:26] <DaveMethvin> it wouldn't surprise me to see the w3c abandon the webkit model
[17:58:37] <rwaldron> interesting
[17:58:43] <DaveMethvin> apple won't let go of their patents so it can't be standardized afaict
[17:59:09] <rwaldron> so, the way this works is that _any_ touch events could be tested
[17:59:32] <DaveMethvin> i was just looking at the bench
[17:59:44] <rwaldron> as long as some touch things are supported
[17:59:49] <DaveMethvin> it's kind of assuming webkit touch event model tho
[18:00:07] <rwaldron> the problem was that @ajpiano and I had 2 and a half weeks to write the runner and the tests
[18:00:13] <rwaldron> it is now
[18:00:22] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah, not complaining
[18:00:33] <rwaldron> but soon there will be more tests cover more touch implementations
[18:00:40] <rwaldron> already did this for css masks
[18:00:57] <rwaldron> http://rng.io/tests/masking/test.js
[18:01:55] <DaveMethvin> really nice and modular
[18:02:17] <DaveMethvin> that reminds me i wanted to ask jzaefferer if we should upgrade to QUnit 1.3 now
[18:02:21] <DaveMethvin> we're on 1.2
[18:02:41] <rwaldron> i forgot that qunit had versions now
[18:02:43] <rwaldron> neat!
[18:02:47] <rwaldron> yeah... as for modular
[18:03:11] <rwaldron> these tests will run in qunit AND the w3c testharness.js system
[18:03:32] <rwaldron> the site itself is running franken-qunit
[18:03:40] <DaveMethvin> well that's flexible!
[18:03:42] <rwaldron> for tracking nested "modules"
[18:03:52] <rwaldron> but the tests are all broken up like that one
[18:03:58] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah you mentioned that
[18:04:23] <rwaldron> and they all work in regular qunit, with a compat shim that makes them work in either runner
[18:05:39] <DaveMethvin> well i think we're just about ready to launch 1.7.2rc1 but i am worried about this ie6/7 crashing problem
[18:05:59] <rwaldron> ill run them once no
[18:06:01] <rwaldron> now*
[18:06:22] <DaveMethvin> i just don't understand why it's so iffy and breaks for some ppl but not others
[18:11:00] <rwaldron> still running
[18:11:04] <rwaldron> which is both good and bad
[18:12:54] <rwaldron> bad new
[18:12:57] <rwaldron> news*
[18:13:10] <rwaldron> IE6 went black
[18:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> When AMD/CommonJS say "A term must be a camelCase identifier" Is there an actual definition of what characters are valid for a "camelCase identifier"?
[18:23:26] <rwaldron> anything that is a valid identifier, i presume
[18:23:26] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a shitty explanation of what a valid module identifier is.
[18:23:48] <scott_gonzalez> heh, rwaldron: This is in the definition of what an identifier is :-/
[18:23:52] <scott_gonzalez> http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1.1#Module_Identifiers
[18:24:00] <rwaldron> scott_gonzalez http://es5.github.com/#x7.6
[18:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...ok. Thanks.
[18:27:17] <rwaldron> does that help at all?
[18:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...why is IdentifierName listed in the definition of IdentifierName?
[18:29:06] <rwaldron> looks like a typo
[18:29:28] <rwaldron> or copy/paste mistake
[18:30:18] <rwaldron> nope
[18:30:25] <rwaldron> it's in the official doc
[18:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> Meh. I'll deal with that part later.
[18:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[18:54:06] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin good news...
[18:54:15] <rwaldron> ie7 ran to completion
[18:54:21] <rwaldron> lemme retry 6
[18:54:37] <DaveMethvin> give it lots of time, it is very slow ... thanks!
[19:05:33] <rwaldron> ugh it timed out this time
[19:05:39] <rwaldron> and i was wasnt paying attention
[19:08:10] <rwaldron> nearly 11 years old...
[19:08:12] <rwaldron> ie6
[19:08:41] <rwaldron> so i thik the trick with IE7 was to tick "hide passed tests"
[19:08:50] <rwaldron> which i did
[19:08:55] <rwaldron> less crap it has to do
[19:09:35] <rwaldron> eek
[19:09:40] <rwaldron> black out
[19:20:16] <DaveMethvin> man this is tough, it's hard to know if there is really a problem or not
[19:20:50] <DaveMethvin> i suppose it's an rc, but as rare as ie6 is getting i doubt we'll get field reports before final is released
[21:28:34] <Krinkle> Hey I was wondering why in jQuery.Event stopPropagation() always sets e.cancelBubble whereas preventDefault() only sets e.returnValue if e.preventDefault doesn't exist
[21:28:44] <Krinkle> anyone know of a reason?
[21:29:08] <Krinkle> 		if ( e.stopPropagation ) { e.stopPropagation(); }
[21:29:08] <Krinkle> 		e.cancelBubble = true;
[21:29:25] <Krinkle> 		if ( e.preventDefault ) { e.preventDefault(); } else {
[21:29:25] <Krinkle> 			e.returnValue = false; }
