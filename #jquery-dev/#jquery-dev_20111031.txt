[06:07:14] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: hey - just a heads up - i'm not gonna be able to make it to the meeting
[06:07:27] <DaveMethvin> :( we'll miss you
[06:07:29] <gnarf> aye
[06:07:32] <gnarf> i'll miss you too
[06:07:41] <kswedberg> I'll miss you, too, gnarf!
[06:07:50] <DaveMethvin> i'll miss him more!
[06:08:03] <gnarf> kswedberg / DaveMethvin: anything you need from me @ the meeting
[06:08:05] <kswedberg> of course you will. DaveMethvin wins again. :(
[06:08:22] <DaveMethvin> still have to figure out this crazy support problem
[06:08:32] <gnarf> the ie8 one?
[06:08:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:08:40] <gnarf> im no help there, i still haven't bought a browserstack
[06:08:52] <gnarf> and my vm's are horrible
[06:08:53] <kswedberg> gnarf: nothing for the meeting. I updated the docs based on your notes at http://oksoclap.com/1-7-docs.
[06:09:00] <DaveMethvin> wanted to get the history on the bug, seems like timmywil and rwaldron were deep in it
[06:09:01] <gnarf> kswedberg: saw that - thanks :)
[06:09:16] <gnarf> kswedberg: anyone had a chance to review that runner object?
[06:09:19] <kswedberg> gnarf, the only thing I have left is the runner object arg because I'm not entire clear
[06:09:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah we're knocking down the docs at least, and the delay gives us time to get that done
[06:09:21] <gnarf> tbh
[06:09:40] <kswedberg> *entirely clear
[06:09:43] <gnarf> honesty: that runner thing is lost to me
[06:09:49] <gnarf> the api is buggng me
[06:10:03] <kswedberg> gnarf: should we leave it undocumented for now? I'm ok with that if you are. :)
[06:10:04] <gnarf> and its annoying
[06:10:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah undoc is a great option for stuff we may want to change
[06:10:47] <gnarf> I had a better idea using $.Callbacks
[06:10:57] <gnarf> instead...
[06:11:23] <gnarf> basically its a method for attaching a callback to a .stop()
[06:11:31] <gnarf> right now you set "runner.stop = fn"
[06:11:39] <kswedberg> cool. gnarf, if you're the one who added runner, and you don't feel great about it, I think leaving undocumented is the best way to go. at least for the time being.
[06:11:48] <gnarf> and runner is just an empty object cached on data
[06:11:52] <gnarf> kswedberg: undoc is fine
[06:12:07] <kswedberg> yay! thx, gnarf. less work for me == awesome!
[06:12:31] <DaveMethvin> think of the time we'd save by not documenting jQuery()
[06:12:38] <gnarf> we only used it to implement .stop() for .delay()
[06:12:45] <kswedberg> gnarf: appreciate the add'l explanation, though
[06:13:56] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/queue.js#L130-135
[06:14:06] <gnarf> i mean, in practice it doesn't look so bad....
[06:14:47] <gnarf> i was thinking about maybe making the argument a callbacks.add()
[06:14:50] <gnarf> so it would be like
[06:14:55] <gnarf> onstop( fn ) instead
[06:15:19] <gnarf> any opinion there which feels more comfy? DaveMethvin?
[06:16:32] <DaveMethvin> do multiple handlers make sense gnarf as far as a common use case? if so then yeah it would be better to use callbacks and a queue
[06:16:40] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: no
[06:16:52] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i don't think there would ever be multiple handlers
[06:17:03] <DaveMethvin> ok then i would just leave it as-is i guess
[06:18:02] <gnarf> its gonna be a bitch to document as is
[06:18:03] <gnarf> :)
[06:18:46] <DaveMethvin> well that's why we're punting! :D
[06:18:48] <kswedberg> does runner have any other properties?
[06:18:52] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: do you think we will be doing RC2 today?
[06:18:54] <kswedberg> or just stop
[06:18:54] <gnarf> kswedberg: no
[06:18:59] <gnarf> kswedberg: its {}
[06:19:04] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: i hope so, but it's a crazy day for me
[06:19:23] <DaveMethvin> i have a meeting at 10, but should be at the meeting at noon
[06:19:25] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: it's a spoooooky day for me!
[06:19:37] <kswedberg> gnarf: gotcha
[06:19:37] <DaveMethvin> then if we're lucky we can knock down this problem with ie8 in the afternoon
[06:19:57] <gnarf> kswedberg: and then the "stop" function also gets passed "gotoEnd"
[06:20:08] <gnarf> if its ever called
[06:20:20] <gnarf> "hook" might make more sense than "runner"
[06:20:23] <gnarf> hook.stop = fn
[06:21:24] <kswedberg> i'm not familiar with the term "runner" but I'm just a former English teacher, so I I know almost nothing.
[06:21:38] <kswedberg> hook makes more sense to me.
[06:23:06] <kswedberg> then again, we use the term "hooks" all over the place now, so we should be careful of diluting the meaning.
[06:23:16] <gnarf> kswedberg: well its kinda what it is
[06:23:21] <gnarf> it hooks the stop function
[06:23:24] <kswedberg> ok.
[06:23:39] <gnarf> "the stop hook"
[06:24:28] <kswedberg> gnarf: gotcha.
[06:24:35] <gnarf> try elem.queue( function ( next, hook ) { hook.stop = function( gotoEnd ) { console.log( "Queue stopped", gotoEnd ) } } ).stop();
[06:26:05] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/Cb8gN/
[06:26:27] <gnarf> kswedberg: how the hell we describe that....
[06:26:30] <gnarf> :)
[06:27:13] <kswedberg> gnarf: punt for now! let it sit for a while. ;)
[06:27:15] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: I'm gonna send in a tiny pull for s130,135/runner/hook/ in queue
[06:27:27] <DaveMethvin> k
[06:27:31] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: makes it make more sense
[06:27:35] <gnarf> agree?
[06:27:39] <DaveMethvin> i can land it, sure

[06:52:36] <timmywil> well, hmmm, i need to affect styles on a different container
[07:00:23] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: gotta run to a meeting but will be back for noon
[07:00:31] <timmywil> but this passes and doesn't crash, so I just need to get the variables right
[08:11:38] <timmywil> where rick at

[08:30:17] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: sup?
[08:32:25] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: ok, this commit prevents the crash in IE8, but after I did cleanup, it crashed again: https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commit/93750cee36f0b2edc1afd2dad64d9306865a39b9
[08:32:26] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by timmywil (1h, 42m ago): Run offset support tests at doc ready. Fixes #10613.
[08:32:39] <timmywil> https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/compare/master...bug_10613
[08:33:39] <timmywil> so somewhere between those commits, i reintroduced a crash :P
[08:34:08] <DaveMethvin> :(
[08:35:46] <DaveMethvin> so i do think this is some kind of crazy timing-and-or-uninitialized-pointer problem
[08:36:08] <DaveMethvin> and the stuff we are changing is probably just tweaking the timing or pushing something to where the pointer is okay
[08:57:05] <timmywil> ok, if i keep the container created with createElement, there is no crash
[08:59:18] <timmywil> this is some wonky stuff
[09:02:21] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: meeting?
[09:02:29] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:02:48] <timmywil> ajpiano: can you set the mode
[09:03:04] <timmywil> or gnarf
[09:03:04] <DaveMethvin> i was gonna ask you... :)
[09:03:13] <DaveMethvin> gnarf is out today
[09:03:20] <timmywil> ha
[09:03:22] <timmywil> jzaefferer
[09:03:33] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: can you set the mode in -meeting?
[09:03:39] <timmywil> paul_irish_
[09:03:42] <rwaldron> I cannot
[09:03:43] <timmywil> surely there's someone!
[09:03:46] <timmywil> JohnResig
[09:03:47] <rwaldron> also, I'm in a client meeting
[09:03:53] <rwaldron> so I can't make the meeting today
[09:03:58] <rwaldron> but there is a serious regression
[09:04:02] <DaveMethvin> we can have it here if needed ... sounds like it's me and timmywil
[09:04:06] <rwaldron> I have a working patch
[09:04:07] <rwaldron> sort of
[09:04:16] <rwaldron> firefox is being a brat
[09:04:17] <timmywil> ah, thanks ajpiano
[09:04:25] <DaveMethvin> saw that ticket and noted in the meeting notes ... thanks rwaldron
[09:04:52] <rwaldron> I will have it finished by end of day
[09:05:03] <rwaldron> thats all I have for now
[09:05:08] <rwaldron> need to get back to the meeting
[09:05:10] <rwaldron> sorry dudes
[09:05:22] <rwaldron> I'll check the notes and read the log later
[09:36:25] <timmywil> well, jqcommit fail
[09:36:33] <timmywil> but ie8 is running again!

[09:39:04] <timmywil> good, it's undocumented too right?
[09:39:17] <timmywil> i've already removed it
[09:39:20] <timmywil> :)
[09:39:29] <timmywil> we also lost some bytes!
[09:39:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i'll mention it in the release notes
[09:39:50] <DaveMethvin> c'mon big green!
[09:42:09] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: timmywil i gave you guys privs in -meeting
[09:42:20] <timmywil> ajpiano: thanks!
[09:43:01] <DaveMethvin> thanks ajpiano
[09:43:07] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: looking good there
[09:44:27] <timmywil> yea, as soon as ie8 finished this job, it started redoing one of the fails on the last job and crashed (so that's a good sign!)
[09:57:30] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: can you stick your safari on the swarm
[09:57:44] <timmywil> something's a little screwy with mine
[09:58:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah give me a few minutes
[10:02:34] <DaveMethvin> ok, started now
[10:02:59] <timmywil> just some that are yellow that I can't get to finish
[10:03:10] <timmywil> http://swarm.jquery.org/job/196/
[10:03:21] <timmywil> other than that, all the regular fails
[10:03:42] <DaveMethvin> timmywil scott_gonzalez: i ran the UI suite and it passes totally in 1.7 on Chrome, has the same fails in 1.7 as 1.6.4 on 1.7 afaict for other browsers
[10:04:04] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:04:08] <timmywil> sweet
[10:05:13] <DaveMethvin> gotta do something about that ... core ain't done till ui won't run
[10:05:33] <timmywil> agreed
[10:05:48] <timmywil> so just the show regression and we should be good for rc2?
[10:05:55] <DaveMethvin> i think so
[10:06:04] <DaveMethvin> i'm working on the blog post
[10:06:15] <timmywil> ok, im gonna get some food then
[10:06:23] <DaveMethvin> consume!
[10:06:30] <timmywil> consider it done
[10:06:35] <timmywil> or
[10:06:36] <timmywil> about to be

[13:07:39] <miketaylr> johnwards: something wacky with that site--pretty much blank in opera
[13:07:53] <johnwards> damn, forgot about that bug
[13:07:55] <miketaylr> e.g., http://miketaylr.com/post/160cb069.png
[13:07:56] <johnwards> really weird
[13:08:14] <johnwards> think opera no like html5 sections or something

[13:53:37] <gnarf> holy shit
[13:53:41] <gnarf> noone had -m privs?
[13:53:54] <DaveMethvin> nope, but ajpiano fixed that
[13:54:19] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: you around?
[13:54:39] <DaveMethvin> once i get that last patch and we do a round of tests, we're ready for rc2
[13:55:01] <DaveMethvin> i have something tonight at 7pm so i want to make sure we can get this out
[13:55:08] <DaveMethvin> won't be back till like 11
[13:56:02] <gnarf> did ajpiano give you guys ops?
[14:21:26] <DaveMethvin> gnarf timmywil, do  you have the details on this last bug that rwaldron was working on?
[14:21:47] <rwaldron> DaveMethvin I asked timmywil if he could help me out
[14:21:59] <rwaldron> I got stuck with the client until about 40 mins ago
[14:21:59] <timmywil> yea, i've just been swamped
[14:22:12] <DaveMethvin> is it a simple fix?
[14:22:15] <rwaldron> no
[14:22:18] <DaveMethvin> lol
[14:22:24] <DaveMethvin> WRONG ANSWER!
[14:22:24] <rwaldron> basically, we broke it trying to fix some other shit in Firefox
[14:22:37] <rwaldron> it was a simple fix in all browsers except for Firefox
[14:22:43] <DaveMethvin> so would it be better to unfix and regroup for 1.7 maybe?
[14:22:50] <rwaldron> hm.
[14:22:51] <DaveMethvin> how bad is the bug we re-expose?
[14:22:57] <timmywil> eh
[14:22:59] <timmywil> not bad
[14:23:05] <rwaldron> what??
[14:23:07] <rwaldron> really?
[14:23:16] <DaveMethvin> compared to the one we are creating that is :)
[14:23:19] <rwaldron> it will break layouts
[14:23:30] <timmywil> it will break animating a td
[14:23:41] <DaveMethvin> damn that worked at one point?
[14:23:43] <timmywil> which has been broken a long time
[14:23:48] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[14:23:51] <rwaldron> it will breaking hiding/showing anything
[14:23:59] <rwaldron> that has a custom display style
[14:24:02] <timmywil> rwaldron: if we revert?
[14:24:10] <rwaldron> actually, now that I think about it
[14:24:17] <timmywil> lol
[14:24:21] <rwaldron> ... the word...
[14:24:23] <rwaldron> "custom"
[14:24:34] <rwaldron> let's weigh this
[14:25:03] <rwaldron> timmywil and i fixed an issue that centered around non-user created problems
[14:25:07] <rwaldron> it was browser based
[14:25:14] <rwaldron> this new issue is a user issue
[14:25:15] <timmywil> lemme look at this again
[14:25:25] <DaveMethvin> k
[14:25:31] <rwaldron> but basically, anyone using a list for navigation is fucked
[14:25:49] <rwaldron> eg. list for horizontal nav bar
[14:25:54] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: you mean if we revert?
[14:26:03] <rwaldron> naw
[14:26:06] <rwaldron> the new issue
[14:26:09] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[14:26:22] <rwaldron> if we revert, i think thats what timmywil was saying
[14:26:28] <rwaldron> animating a "tr" or something
[14:26:31] <rwaldron> dumb
[14:26:42] <DaveMethvin> ok so to me it sounds like in the worst case we just back out this patch and a few things that have been broken for a long time remain broken
[14:26:42] <timmywil> yes, that's what i was saying
[14:26:51] <timmywil> true
[14:27:08] <DaveMethvin> which isn't so bad at all compared to breaking a bunch of stuff if we leave it as is
[14:27:38] <timmywil> i realize now we can't fix it that way anyway
[14:28:27] <rwaldron> so, sems to me that taking that fix out is the way to go?
[14:28:44] <timmywil> agreed
[14:28:50] <DaveMethvin> yeah and then reopen the original ticket
[14:28:56] <DaveMethvin> and close this new one
[14:29:03] <timmywil> yea, close the new one
[14:29:22] <DaveMethvin> timmywil do you know which commit that is?
[14:29:37] <DaveMethvin> o the orig ticket
[14:29:42] <timmywil> yea, i'll just revert
[14:29:57] <DaveMethvin> k
[14:30:25] <timmywil> but way to go defaultDisplay
[14:30:53] <DaveMethvin> there's always 1.7.1

[14:34:21] <DaveMethvin> sweet, all the tix closed/reopened?
[14:34:34] <timmywil> yup
[14:34:45] <timmywil> also added 1.7.1 milestone
[14:34:59] <DaveMethvin> sounds good

[14:36:16] <DaveMethvin> SAVED 6 BYTES, YEAH!
[14:36:24] <timmywil> wooooo
[14:36:26] <gnarf> heh
[14:37:12] <timmywil> man i'd love some dedicated vms for testswarm
[14:37:35] <gnarf> timmywil: i just asked scott about browserstack again
[14:37:49] <timmywil> gnarf: sweet!
[14:37:52] <gnarf> he said he'd ping em
[14:37:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah agreed
[14:38:01] <DaveMethvin> what's with the Err on firefox?
[14:38:30] <gnarf> starting up my ie6
[14:40:33] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: not sure
[14:40:46] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: it will probably clean itself up if osmeone else points anohter ff3.6 at it
[14:40:56] <DaveMethvin> if only i had one
[14:41:30] <gnarf> im downloading now if i can find it
[14:41:31] <rwaldron> timmywil what happens to uses with extant code that refers to "jQuery.offset.supportsFixedPosition "
[14:41:47] <rwaldron> if it was that easy, i would've trashed that shit myself
[14:41:47] <timmywil> i punch them in the face
[14:42:06] <gnarf> i use that
[14:42:13] <timmywil> *punch*
[14:42:17] <gnarf> in ui effects tests
[14:42:18] <rwaldron> gnarf well timmywil just broke your code
[14:42:21] <rwaldron> :P
[14:42:31] <rwaldron> that fucking branch pissed me off
[14:42:55] <rwaldron> think i wanted to do this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/83a355a9a06c03eeb4e601dbe204909d273c91b5#L0L121
[14:42:56] <rwaldron> ???
[14:42:56] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by timmywil (5h, 9m ago): jQuery.support.supportsFixedPosition -> jQuery.support.fixedPosition; Remove jQuery.offset.supportProps and reference support in offset
[14:42:59] <rwaldron> NO
[14:43:47] <timmywil> i think 1.7 is a good time to move it complete to support
[14:43:53] <rwaldron> the whole point of that 1.7 feature was to run those tests before doc ready
[14:44:01] <rwaldron> so basically it was a bullshit ticket/feature
[14:44:44] <timmywil> yea i know, that's not ideal.  It was the only thing that stopped the crash in IE8
[14:44:45] <gnarf> ie errors in effects related to show/display
[14:44:57] <gnarf> Died on test #2: Could not get the display property. Invalid argument. - { "name": "Error", "number": -2147024809, "description": "Could not get the display property. Invalid argument.", "message": "Could not get the display property. Invalid argument." }
[14:45:29] <rwaldron> I dunno, I did a lot of testing on that and crashing was definitely not something I ever witnessed
[14:45:53] <timmywil> i could reproduce it every time, but only after restarting the browser
[14:45:58] <rwaldron> but then again, its unclear if those browsers are corrupt
[14:46:28] <DaveMethvin> rwaldron: I could reproduce the problem sporadically, timmywil got it every time
[14:46:33] <gnarf> and IE6 missing an assertion in live/die
[14:46:48] <timmywil> bah, live/die
[14:46:54] <DaveMethvin> die die!
[14:47:28] <rwaldron> yeah, but I'm pretty sure other things have changed in that module since I wrote those patches and ran those tests
[14:47:52] <gnarf> hrm
[14:47:55] <rwaldron> anyway
[14:48:04] <gnarf> this :focus doesn't match test in selector
[14:48:24] <gnarf> we need to ie-proof it
[14:48:37] <gnarf> is that in sizzle?
[14:48:40] <timmywil> it does work if the browser has focus
[14:49:04] <gnarf> yeah, you can still IE proof it for "non-focused" browsers too
[14:49:17] <timmywil> that's not just an IE problem
[14:49:33] <gnarf> if ( document.activeElement === theBlurredElement ) { document.body.focus() }
[14:49:52] <rwaldron> I'm heading out
[14:49:59] <rwaldron> today sucks.
[14:49:59] <gnarf> timmywil: that is a qSA bug as opposed to a bug in the focus tests :)
[14:50:01] <rwaldron> later
[14:50:20] <gnarf> timmywil: its for the "doesn't match" case
[14:51:32] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/commit/e31adf039b4adb07b8878435beceaae1a6532d47
[14:51:33] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-ui by scottgonzalez (23m, 33s ago): Tests (Simulate): Added focus and blur support.
[14:51:57] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: it keeps growing ;)
[14:52:17] <gnarf> scott just added focusin / focusout to the events created
[14:53:14] <gnarf> timmywil: the ":focus doesn't match" is an ie problem
[14:53:26] <gnarf> the ":focus does match" is the one that bugs everywhere with matchesSelector
[14:54:59] <gnarf> this IE bug in effects seems pretty serious
[14:56:43] <gnarf> and FF Current support tests are freakin out too
[14:57:16] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: where did they come from??
[14:57:23] <paul_irish> timmywil: fwiw i think the fakebody thing isnt needed anymore. from what i can tell it was only needed in ff4 betas
[14:57:48] <timmywil> paul_irish: i already tried removing it
[14:58:09] <paul_irish> no go?
[14:58:24] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: im not sure
[14:58:41] <timmywil> it couldn't understand fixed position
[15:00:25] <DaveMethvin> ok, well the simulate focus/blur stuff is basically stuff we are doing to pass unit tests, it is not indicative of real code problems ... agree?
[15:00:34] <timmywil> yes
[15:00:43] <DaveMethvin> so, what does that leave?
[15:01:09] <timmywil> im not sure how the support tests in FF failed unless by extensive browser caching.  It passed on the last job.
[15:01:09] <gnarf> support in current FF
[15:01:11] <DaveMethvin> looks like the firefox stuff is for real
[15:01:52] <gnarf> timmywil: it shouldn't be caching ANYTHING per-job since the URL For all the files is swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery/commitsha/tests/
[15:02:05] <gnarf> and commitsha is obviously different
[15:02:19] <timmywil> gnarf: then it doesn't make sense
[15:02:21] <gnarf> the effects in IE seem to be giving an error with display for .show() too
[15:02:39] <DaveMethvin> i can repro the ff7 stuff here
[15:03:28] <gnarf> timmywil: http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery/0752687612d190f608e64181148ced1a4adfa5d6/test/index.html?filter=support
[15:03:32] <gnarf> i can repro that in FF7
[15:03:36] <gnarf> even with force refresh
[15:03:44] <timmywil> i believe you, but it certainly does not make sense
[15:03:45] <jzaefferer> I hate it when there's a highlight along with 1000 new messages and the search in this client doesn't really work - was there something I should respond to?
[15:04:08] <timmywil> jzaefferer: nah
[15:04:09] <mikesherov> did I miss the vote for 1.8?
[15:04:23] <timmywil> mikesherov: haven't gotten that far
[15:04:38] <gnarf> mikesherov: nope - we haven't even officially asked for canidates to vote on yet :)
[15:04:49] <mikesherov> So, where can I read about what the timeline for all that is?
[15:04:54] <mikesherov> and how the process works?
[15:05:02] <mikesherov> #lazydev
[15:05:10] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov, we'll catch up tomorrow
[15:05:24] <gnarf> i'll PM you a story
[15:05:25] <DaveMethvin> i only have an hour to get rc2 out tonight before i leave
[15:05:32] <mikesherov> sorry
[15:05:39] <gnarf> keep the dev chat about rc2 for now ;)
[15:05:49] <mikesherov> np
[15:05:50] <mikesherov> understood
[15:06:43] <jzaefferer> Y U NO ONE EIGHT?
[15:07:29] <DaveMethvin> lol jzaefferer
[15:07:35] <DaveMethvin> hey it's the doc ready commit
[15:07:42] <DaveMethvin> timmywil gnarf ^
[15:08:01] <mikesherov> just saw a few commits from timmywil about the doc ready support tests
[15:08:24] <mikesherov> was going to say if there's failures in the build, gotta be from those commits, no?
[15:08:50] <timmywil> yes
[15:09:05] <DaveMethvin> yeah just not clear why only ff doesn't like it
[15:09:11] <gnarf> and only FF7
[15:09:32] <DaveMethvin> timmywil if  you're on that one maybe gnarf and i can look at what's left ... gnarf you said something about ie?
[15:09:49] <timmywil> actually, i was looking at this display one first
[15:10:10] <gnarf> (that ie one i was talking about)
[15:15:52] <gnarf> im trying to figure out whats hapening in this support test
[15:15:56] <gnarf> but i'm just plain confused
[15:16:18] <mikesherov> jQuery.Callbacks is not a function
[15:16:24] <timmywil> alright, i can switch to the support test if you want to look at the display test
[15:17:01] <mikesherov> file:///C:/Documents%20and%20Settings/mike/My%20Documents/programming/jquery/test/index.html?filter=support%3A%20A%20background%20on%20the%20testElement%20does%20not%20cause%20IE8%20to%20crash%20%28%239823%29
[15:17:05] <timmywil> unfortunately, i think firebug lite is using the new jQuery and failing as I'm trying to test things
[15:17:45] <mikesherov> is also causing test/index.html?filter=support%3A%20A%20background%20on%20the%20testElement%20does%20not%20cause%20IE8%20to%20crash%20%28%239823%29 is also causing "jQuery.Callbacks is not defined"
[15:18:17] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: are you sure your master is up to date?
[15:18:30] <mikesherov> just updated it, but I'll check again
[15:19:01] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you're not seeing it?
[15:19:08] <DaveMethvin> starting a vm now
[15:20:04] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: nope not on master
[15:20:09] <gnarf> mikesherov: not seeing that...
[15:20:17] <DaveMethvin> empty the cache, sounds like a cache thing
[15:21:01] <mikesherov> I'm on FF3.6
[15:21:22] <gnarf> hrm
[15:21:40] <mikesherov> readyList = jQuery.Callbacks( "once memory" ); core.js line 430
[15:23:25] <mikesherov> With the support test, the execution order is wacky
[15:23:29] <gnarf> i think this fixes the support test: http://cl.ly/02341c0R1g2v33431B26
[15:23:34] <DaveMethvin> mikesherov: look in your jquery/test/index.html, do you see callbacks.js included?
[15:23:36] <gnarf> but what i'm curious about
[15:23:55] <gnarf> is why its only affecting FF7
[15:24:09] <timmywil> yea me too, i just did the same thing tho
[15:24:28] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: yes
[15:24:37] <mikesherov> gnarf: affects FF3.6 as well
[15:24:40] <gnarf> are there properties on support that aren't calculated until document ready?
[15:24:47] <DaveMethvin> there are NOW
[15:24:52] <jqcommit> [jquery] timmywil pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/BUbGfg
[15:24:52] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Pass iframe support tests at doc ready. Fixes support fail in FF7 - timmywil
[15:24:53] <mikesherov> gnarf, yes, that's timmywil's change
[15:24:59] <timmywil> unfortunately
[15:25:05] <timmywil> but just the offset ones
[15:25:28] <gnarf> so then this test should be deferred with a doc ready in the iframe
[15:25:29] <mikesherov> wonder why it's only in FF
[15:25:31] <gnarf> like so
[15:25:31] <gnarf> right?
[15:25:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah that makes no sense
[15:25:48] <DaveMethvin> why shoudln't it break everywhere
[15:26:03] <gnarf> because the document is already ready enough?
[15:26:13] <timmywil> and why didn't it break last time we ran the exact same support code in a job
[15:26:29] <gnarf> hrm
[15:26:29] <mikesherov> heisenbug
[15:26:52] <gnarf> i wonder what the readyState is
[15:26:58] <timmywil> hence why i said long ago, that makes no sense
[15:27:08] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery build #151: STILL FAILING in 2 min 7 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery/151/
[15:27:09] <jq-jenkins> timmywillisn: Pass iframe support tests at doc ready. Fixes support fail in FF7
[15:27:37] <timmywil> alright, so just this effects stuff
[15:28:21] <gnarf> im wondering if changing that test is wise - but it seems the way it should have been written in the first place right?
[15:28:26] <gnarf> timmywil: and actually
[15:28:29] <gnarf> it didn't break before
[15:28:41] <gnarf> because we prolly werent testing that same case before?
[15:28:45] <timmywil> we never needed it to pass jQuery.support after doc ready before
[15:29:08] <gnarf> well now that there are support tests that fire on doc ready...
[15:29:37] <timmywil> exactly
[15:29:58] <gnarf> did these tests exist before we tried this fake body thing?
[15:30:06] <timmywil> they used to be lazy
[15:30:20] <gnarf> define lazy?
[15:30:27] <timmywil> only run on the first offset call
[15:30:32] <gnarf> right
[15:30:38] <gnarf> i remember
[15:30:51] <gnarf> so like
[15:31:01] <gnarf> whats the issue here btw?
[15:31:09] <gnarf> is this fake body concept just flawed in IE8?
[15:31:18] <gnarf> cuz i think we stole it for something in UI
[15:31:21] <gnarf> kborchers: ?
[15:31:26] <DaveMethvin> seems like a detached body in the head of ie8 causes a crash
[15:31:44] <gnarf> fucking ie8
[15:31:50] <DaveMethvin> other way round
[15:31:52] <timmywil> gnarf: it's very sensitive
[15:32:09] <gnarf> ie8 just raped us
[15:32:20] <gnarf> we all said "no" but it didn't listen
[15:32:28] <timmywil> true
[15:32:49] <timmywil> is anyone else looking at this effects fail?  I'm not sure what's going on
[15:33:27] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/?state=runresults&run_id=1077&client_id=1020
[15:33:29] <DaveMethvin> that one?
[15:33:58] <timmywil> yes
[15:34:08] <DaveMethvin> i am now
[15:35:19] <gnarf> timmywil: i looked but like couldn't figure out what was causing it
[15:35:24] <timmywil> it seems to fail when creating the disconnected element
[15:35:42] <kborchers> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1-8-stable/ui/jquery.ui.position.js#L262
[15:36:00] <timmywil> crap, that's just a firebug-lite issue
[15:36:04] <timmywil> i need better tools
[15:36:29] <gnarf> kborchers: we need to switch to running that on document ready
[15:36:35] <gnarf> kborchers: as lame as that is
[15:36:50] <gnarf> hey timmy
[15:37:00] <timmywil> yo
[15:37:04] <gnarf> do your support tests run if a body already exists?
[15:37:13] <gnarf> because like there is no reason to defer if the body is already there right?
[15:37:16] <DaveMethvin> they use the real body now
[15:37:31] <kborchers> gnarf: i can make that change a little later this evening
[15:37:49] <gnarf> so like if ( ! document.body ) { jQuery( checkThings ); } else { checkThings(); }
[15:38:09] <DaveMethvin> oh god ie6
[15:38:11] <kborchers> i'll do it as a PR so others can take a look before messing with 1-8-stable
[15:38:31] <kborchers> gotta run
[15:38:40] <timmywil> gnarf: i thought about it
[15:38:55] <timmywil> but no
[15:39:36] <gnarf> maybe they should?
[15:39:36] <timmywil> it might be worth doing, but if the body is there, jQuery was probably loaded at the bottom, in which case doc is very very close to ready
[15:40:02] <DaveMethvin> seems like we run the risk of creating two very different code path situations that way
[15:40:10] <DaveMethvin> also document.body is there from the very start
[15:40:22] <gnarf> well getElementsByTagName("body")[0] then
[15:40:32] <DaveMethvin> it's there early too
[15:40:40] <DaveMethvin> unless it's a frameset doc
[15:40:55] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: you sure about that?
[15:41:01] <timmywil> didn't seem that way in ie
[15:41:16] <gnarf> that ie issue shows up in ie8 too right?
[15:41:24] <gnarf> so like maybe its debugging tools are better
[15:41:25] <timmywil> gnarf: that was main crasher
[15:41:31] <DaveMethvin> the problem is that it's a non-modifiable body  at times
[15:41:34] <timmywil> oh the display one
[15:41:41] <DaveMethvin> you can't push things into it in ie
[15:41:43] <timmywil> yes
[15:42:34] <DaveMethvin> but like, document.body is there right after the <html> tag i am pretty sure
[15:42:41] <DaveMethvin> let me spin up my ie6 sys and check
[15:44:39] <timmywil> just noticed this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/css.js#L243
[15:44:47] <timmywil> that test doesn't run at doc ready anymore
[15:45:38] <timmywil> ok, it's definitely the .show call
[15:45:52] <DaveMethvin> btw body *is* null in ie6
[15:45:56] <DaveMethvin> document.body
[15:46:03] <timmywil> heh
[15:46:11] <timmywil> awesome
[15:46:11] * DaveMethvin eats crow
[15:46:16] <timmywil> bah
[15:50:10] <gnarf> ?
[15:55:03] <gnarf> timmywil: are you a sheep?
[15:56:16] <DaveMethvin> this makes no sense!
[15:57:50] <timmywil> ie8 seems throw an error at line 56
[15:59:00] <gnarf> timmywil: like assigning elem.style.display ?
[15:59:17] <timmywil> or in the olddisplay call
[15:59:45] <gnarf> style guidance on that line btws
[15:59:51] <gnarf> parens inside args
[15:59:59] <gnarf> er spaces inside parens
[16:00:01] <gnarf> wow
[16:00:05] <gnarf> brain got ahead of itself there
[16:00:07] <timmywil> lol
[16:00:14] <gnarf> :)
[16:00:24] <timmywil> spaces added
[16:00:46] <gnarf> line 42 as well
[16:00:51] <gnarf> and 34
[16:00:57] <DaveMethvin> something seems really hosed up here ...
[16:01:02] <gnarf> and 23 ;)
[16:01:09] <gnarf> and 27 ;)
[16:01:51] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: got more?
[16:01:53] <DaveMethvin> in the jQuery.support IIFE we check for body several times but I just checked and i cannot get document.body or document.getElementsByTagName("body") to give me a body in the head
[16:02:09] <DaveMethvin> so none of that code would seem to run properly
[16:02:25] <DaveMethvin> i could have sworn document.body was avilable in the head
[16:02:34] <DaveMethvin> but doesn't seem so
[16:03:09] <DaveMethvin> so all that code is basically not functional if you include jquery in the head
[16:03:49] <timmywil> ok, for some reason jQuery._data( elem, "olddisplay" ) is "auto"
[16:05:04] <gnarf> hey timmywil might i suggest caching privateData = jQuery._data( elem );
[16:05:13] <gnarf> and then using privateData.olddisplay ?
[16:05:26] <gnarf> nvm
[16:05:29] <gnarf> its inside a loop
[16:05:32] <timmywil> i just copied and pasted
[16:05:32] <gnarf> i just saw that
[16:05:56] <gnarf> so "defaultDisplay(elem)" is returning auto?
[16:06:03] <gnarf> er elem.nodeName
[16:06:16] <gnarf> or is .css( "display" ) returning auto?
[16:06:39] <timmywil> yea .css
[16:06:48] <timmywil> must be why this is only an issue in ie
[16:06:59] <timmywil> hmm, we did make a change to currentStyle
[16:08:18] <DaveMethvin> i think this code got kind of messed up at some point ... we used to do more at doc ready in support and it changed
[16:08:19] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/blob/dd2376bbfd45468ca9a35cea19cfca34456a2f11/src/support.js#L128
[16:08:32] <DaveMethvin> so now the check for body is outside ready and it makes no sense anymore
[16:08:57] <gnarf> hrm
[16:08:59] <gnarf> so
[16:09:01] <gnarf> random idea
[16:09:13] <gnarf> jQuery.support.withBody( function( body ) { } );
[16:09:21] <gnarf> make it a callbacks with memory
[16:10:07] <DaveMethvin> i think a simple ready can suffice tho, it just needs to be untangled
[16:10:17] <DaveMethvin> we may not be too far off here but the check for body outside ready is wrong
[16:10:19] <timmywil> alright, I've gotta run.  i need to get to my own party
[16:10:28] <timmywil> im an hour late now
[16:10:34] <DaveMethvin> unfortunatley i have to leave too, so i guess we'll have to do rc2 tomroor
[16:10:36] <DaveMethvin> tomorrow
[16:10:45] <gnarf> :(
[16:10:47] <DaveMethvin> my wife is looking at me ....
[16:10:47] <timmywil> sorry guys
[16:10:51] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[16:10:57] <gnarf> eh - we all tried
[16:11:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah and didn't expect these probs
[16:11:11] <DaveMethvin> ok cya later
[18:32:40] <gnarf> ajpiano: you here?
[18:32:55] <gnarf> i remember you linking to a list of "boilerplate messages" for the bug tracker
[18:40:15] <gnarf> i was just looking at the core bugs emails
[18:40:30] <gnarf> and there was one thats a UI bug on top of being a shitty bug report
