[12:09:03] <magixx32> I am trying to get the width of items inside hidden tabs of jquery-ui, my example is here http://jsbin.com/anesif/1, i tried adding .ui-tabs .ui-tabs-hide{position: absolute; left: -10000px;} to my css like it says at the end of http://ui-dev.jquery.com/demos/tabs/ but that does nothing
[12:09:09] <magixx32> what do i need to do to get the proper width and not just 0 because the display: none is in effect for hidden tabs
[22:12:56] <JamesMGreene> Say, there aren't any licensing (CLA) issues with us taking personal ownership of current QUnit plugins, right?
[22:13:15] <JamesMGreene> Pretty sure the CLA was written to allow for that, IIRC
[22:13:43] <JamesMGreene> (Since Krinkle|detached and I are extracting the remaining bundled QUnit plugins into our personal repos)
[23:25:58] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer Krinkle|detached scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin|away rworth ajpiano: Anyone around?
[23:26:18] <rworth> JamesMGreene just headed to be. what's up?
[23:26:22] <rworth> bed
[23:26:36] <JamesMGreene> When I extract a plugin from the QUnit core codebase and delete its former location, I should still leave its former authors in the AUTHORS.txt, right?
[23:26:49] <JamesMGreene> I assume grunt-git-authors would anyway since they're still in the log
[23:27:31] <rworth> good question
[23:28:35] <rworth> I don't think we ever (would) remove someone from AUTHORS.txt, or rather not just because it would appear a major piece of code they contributed was refactored out
[23:28:45] <rworth> I would think we'd only do it if they requested it
[23:29:07] <rworth> scott_gonzalez may have some input as well
[23:29:15] <JamesMGreene> k
[23:29:17] <rworth> g'night
[23:29:24] <JamesMGreene> That seems aligned with what I thought, thanks for confirming
[23:29:27] <JamesMGreene> G'night
