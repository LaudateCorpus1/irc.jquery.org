[13:39:15] <alik> Hello guys, I am new to open source contributing. I actually forked it and cloned it locally and run "npm install" and "npm test" and everything works. What other repeating tasks I should know for continuos integration. Eg. how do I test the specific staff in test folder? how to test it on all browsers and etc.
[13:39:58] <alik> what section of docs i need to read about this, please help
