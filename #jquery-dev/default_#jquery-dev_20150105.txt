[09:59:10] <timmywil> sorry I missed the meeting.
[09:59:26] <DaveMethvin> no problem timmywil

[09:59:39] <DaveMethvin> do you think you'll have some time for tickets this week?
[09:59:39] <timmywil> so, I'm on build script?
[09:59:50] <DaveMethvin> well you have some assigned
[09:59:51] <timmywil> which is fine
[10:00:11] <timmywil> we want that for next release I guess
[10:00:31] <DaveMethvin> we can work around it but ideally yeah
[10:00:35] <m_gol> yeah, it's necessary since we cannot tag two 3.0.0 releases in one repo ;)
[10:01:07] <m_gol> I don't think there's an easy way to workaround it for Bower
[10:01:15] <m_gol> unless we don't publish the first beta to Bower
[10:01:33] <m_gol> but that will limit exposure that we need so it'd be great to not have to do it :)
[10:01:59] <timmywil> and it'd be good to dogfood
[10:02:06] <DaveMethvin> well there are definitely different types of devs who use jQuery, and Bower users are a different breed than <script> tag users or npm users
[10:02:19] <DaveMethvin> so if possible we should publish widely
[10:03:21] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: i'm going to assign a couple of build tickets to you, i think they may have some overlap
[10:03:29] <timmywil> sure
[10:04:00] <m_gol> do we want https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/issues/294 before the beta?
[10:04:28] <timmywil> just to be clear, we're talking about 2 repos. jquery-bower and jquery-npm?
[10:04:29] <DaveMethvin> if it's landing for jQuery 3.0 then yes
[10:05:03] <DaveMethvin> timmywil: we may want to bikeshed on the names
[10:05:20] <DaveMethvin> jquery-core-bower?
[10:05:28] <timmywil> yea, maybe that's better
[10:05:37] <DaveMethvin> just thinking about if other projects under jquery/jquery decide to do it as well
[10:05:40] <timmywil> err, well
[10:05:55] <timmywil> if jquery-ui did something similar, they'd probably name it jquery-ui-bower
[10:06:14] <timmywil> since jquery isn't named jquery-core, I think we get precedence
[10:06:19] <DaveMethvin> i guess they'll be a jquery-migrate-bower too
[10:06:27] <DaveMethvin> so maybe jquery-bower works
[10:07:04] <m_gol> jquery-bower will be used to publish to npm? weird
[10:07:05] <timmywil> we'll need to set up empty repos that the build script can manipulate
[10:07:21] <timmywil> m_gol: no, separate repo
[10:07:25] <m_gol> ah, ok
[10:07:34] <m_gol> will they be that different?
[10:07:37] <DaveMethvin> if they could go in a single repo we could call it jquery-dist
[10:07:39] <timmywil> no, but it might save headache
[10:07:41] <DaveMethvin> or something like that
[10:07:52] <m_gol> I mean, Bower needs more care
[10:07:54] <timmywil> for instance, we're generating a bower.json for the bower dist
[10:08:06] <m_gol> but what works for Bower will most also work for npm
[10:08:23] <DaveMethvin> and the bower.json is just one extra file, if that's all that's different
[10:08:27] <m_gol> right, we might save a file or two I'm afraid it'll increase maintenance cost
[10:08:42] <timmywil> hmm, yea ok
[10:09:14] <timmywil> I'm just going off of what others have done
[10:09:20] <DaveMethvin> they probably hate this whole process as much as we do :)
[10:10:52] <timmywil> lodash switched to separate repos for module types
[10:11:39] <DaveMethvin> might be good to ask jdalton about why ... he usually has a good reason
[10:13:07] <timmywil> ok, so jquery-dist?
[10:13:40] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: can you create that and set up permissions?
[10:13:52] <timmywil> I'll use that in the script
[10:13:54] <DaveMethvin> sure
[10:15:40] <arthurvr> Yay https://github.com/jquery/jquery-dist
[10:16:00] <DaveMethvin> you should have access timmywil 
[10:16:02] <arthurvr> we probably need a clear repo description
[10:16:05] <m_gol> and jquery-compat-dist?
[10:17:03] <DaveMethvin> yep
[10:21:59] <timmywil> Looks good, thanks

[18:33:03] <gmauer> anyone here know why debugger and console.log statements in jquery source don't work when running unit tests?
[18:34:41] <gmauer> also can't set breakpoints reliably
[18:35:00] <DaveMethvin> gmauer: are you using the uncompressed source?
[18:35:10] <gmauer> yeah, I'm running the unit tests
[18:35:20] <gmauer> so whatever that does - I'm not seeing anything compressed though
[18:36:36] <DaveMethvin> so you're editing the file and not seeing that get run?
[18:36:43] <DaveMethvin> is this Chrome?
[18:36:48] <DaveMethvin> it loves to cache too much
[18:37:02] <gmauer> http://screencast.com/t/Beq6n70p I'm seeing 4 different versions loaded
[18:37:07] <gmauer> of jquery
[18:37:10] <gmauer> some with my changes some without
[18:37:43] <gmauer> building with gulp watch --force
[18:37:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah the 1.9.1 is used internally rather than trusting the one under test
[18:37:48] <DaveMethvin> so that's normal
[18:38:07] <DaveMethvin> but the one you are testing should be editable
[18:38:19] <DaveMethvin> unless your watch is rewriting it maybe?
[18:38:44] <DaveMethvin> i never use grunt watch myself... but i'm on windows
[18:38:56] <gmauer> dist/jquery.js is the one that shows my changes
[18:39:11] <gmauer> but debugger don't get hit and console.log doesn't log
[18:39:26] <gmauer> not sure what else could be run
[18:39:40] <gmauer> when I trace into it it seems like this is the correct method
[18:39:53] <DaveMethvin> did you check the "load unminified" box?
[18:40:00] <DaveMethvin> that would load your jquery.js
[18:40:03] <DaveMethvin> rather than jquery.min.js
[18:41:09] <gmauer> check the laod unminified box where?
[18:41:28] <DaveMethvin> http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/eb3653.png
[18:41:45] <gmauer> ah, no, let me do that
[18:41:55] <DaveMethvin> also be sure to check the box in Chrome that says "disable cache while dev tools is open"
[18:42:12] <gmauer> ok yeah, load unminified did it
[18:42:30] <DaveMethvin> ok cool
