[06:37:02] <safzouf> ?
[07:04:44] <miketaylr> safzouf: you're probably looking for #jquery
[07:04:59] <safzouf> yes :)
[07:05:09] <safzouf> I found the solution anyway
[07:05:11] <safzouf> thanks
[09:33:17] <timmywil> hi

[10:43:13] <danheberden> heh heh
[10:43:35] <danheberden> WHY DID I HAVE TO QUIT IRC SO QUICK
[10:44:13] <danheberden> phishbot did you add yourself to the get involved with jquery form at jqcon?
[10:44:31] <phishbot> no :( is it too late?
[10:44:46] <danheberden> never: bit.ly/jqInvolved
[10:44:59] <phishbot> cheers
[10:46:47] <eddiemonge> wow only thing on there im not part of is bug triage, UI and tests
[10:50:19] <danheberden> eddiemonge :)
[10:51:08] <rworth> eddiemonge: I know how you can fix that ;)
[10:51:37] <danheberden> heh heh
[10:51:54] <eddiemonge> bug triage i could get involved in. and i really should have rights to trac so i can fix those damn infra "bugs"
[10:52:05] <danheberden> eddiemonge with all your work on mobile, you'd be a good with ui
[10:52:08] <eddiemonge> UI i almost was a part of :(
[10:52:26] <eddiemonge> and i am hopeless with tests atm. that should really change too
[10:52:57] <danheberden> eddiemonge do you have time to help with some ui stuff this coming month?
[10:55:29] <eddiemonge> probably yeah although im going to be working on infra stuff, mostly the new site designs and jQm docs and it would be nice to get some of those wordpress sites consolidated
[10:59:10] <jqcommit> jquery: master timmywil * e5457a5 (2 files in 2 dirs): Remove unnecessary background setting in support now that we have the div reversion. Test added. - http://bit.ly/jrUg3D
[11:02:09] <jqcommit> jquery: master timmywil * a5396bd (1 files in 1 dirs): Attach background data to divs as well - http://bit.ly/kl9SSC
[11:17:06] <eddiemonge> JohnResig: you around? or danheberden do you have access to domain name management?
[11:25:05] <danheberden> eddiemonge whats up
[11:26:09] <eddiemonge> https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=651943
[11:26:58] <eddiemonge> actually i guess it does have to be john since the auth code was sent to him
[11:27:18] <danheberden> ya - until it's into our dns manager it's all him
[11:27:40] <eddiemonge> the server is all setup for it and everything
[11:31:29] <jqcommit> jquery: master timmywil * 657b197 (1 files in 1 dirs): Null created elements in support to avoid leaks in IE. Tested IE6-8. Leaks are contained to the byte. Fixes #9294. - http://bit.ly/iAURTw
[11:34:30] <rwaldron> timmywil you can close this now... https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/388
[11:34:46] <timmywil> rwaldron: that still needs to happen, but unrelated
[11:34:55] <rwaldron> er...
[11:35:26] <rwaldron> how do you figure?
[11:35:48] <timmywil> we should be passing a named function, especially in IE.  He's right that the detachEvent never happens. If we're going to detach, it should work.
[11:36:01] <rwaldron> ok
[11:36:03] <timmywil> shouldn't*
[11:36:05] <rwaldron> fair enough
[11:36:08] <rwaldron> but not like that
[11:36:40] <rwaldron> sorry, that vague and obtuse
[11:36:40] <timmywil> you have another take on that?
[11:36:56] <rwaldron> i mean to say that the detachEvent shouldnt happen as a synchronous call
[11:37:04] <timmywil> I'm up for whatever as long as we change it
[11:37:17] <timmywil> oh i see
[11:37:39] <rwaldron> actually
[11:37:48] <rwaldron> we need to think about two scenarios?
[11:37:50] <timmywil> ok we can still do it with the detach inside
[11:38:08] <rwaldron> timmywil one sec.
[11:41:21] <rwaldron> timmywil ok, I can confirm that that callback is run in all IE's
[11:42:10] <timmywil> rwaldron: oh it runs, just doesn't detach because it can't reference a named function that's been passed as an argument
[11:42:46] <rwaldron> right, i was just noting to be thorough
[11:42:52] <rwaldron> in case there was any question
[11:42:56] <rwaldron> geeesh
[11:43:05] <timmywil> oh :P
[11:43:09] <timmywil> sry
[11:45:09] <rwaldron> hm, so my suspicions were unfounded
[11:45:15] <rwaldron> i'd say land it
[11:45:23] <rwaldron> the approach is sound
[11:45:46] <rwaldron> but, for the record, i find it odd that this has become an issue.
[11:46:06] <rwaldron> timmywil ^^
[11:46:09] <rwaldron> also, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/383
[11:46:13] <rwaldron> affects a few files
[11:46:28] <timmywil> it's not a big issue really.  everything works whether it is detached or not.  We may be able to just not detach at all since I don't think that was working anyway.
[11:46:38] <rwaldron> if no one is opposed, it would be wise to minimze the bit-rot on that
[11:47:28] <timmywil> ah yea, I can land that
[11:49:25] <timmywil> rwaldron: if we don't have to detach, we could leave it anonymous and shorten a little
[11:49:41] <timmywil> nulling should take care of it
[11:49:46] <timmywil> if I'm not mistaken
[11:50:00] <rwaldron> thats what i would assume as well
[11:50:08] <rwaldron> null = bulldoze everything
[11:50:15] * rwaldron shrugs
[11:50:21] <rwaldron> i like removing code
[11:50:36] <timmywil> i'll try it and do the leak tests again
[11:51:40] <timmywil> rwaldron: 1 fail in IE6 for the camelCase pull
[11:51:59] <timmywil> Foo-Bar-Baz -> fooBarBaz
[11:52:20] <timmywil> actually that's everywhere
[11:52:57] <rwaldron> whaaaa
[11:52:59] <rwaldron> one sec.
[11:53:28] <rwaldron> shit
[11:53:31] <rwaldron> duh
[11:53:38] <rwaldron> thats a long and weird story
[11:53:39] <rwaldron> one sec
[11:56:19] <rwaldron> timmywil updated
[11:56:44] <rwaldron> so.. .basically, i "proper" camelcasing implementation should first convert all characters to lower case
[11:57:08] <rwaldron> well, I had attempted to do so, but mysteriously broke the hell out of data()
[11:57:12] <rwaldron> so i backed it out
[11:57:25] <rwaldron> and clearly forgot to remove the failing test that drove that implementation
[11:57:32] <rwaldron> anyway, like i said, all set
[11:57:35] <timmywil> rwaldron: ah makes sense
[12:09:14] <jqcommit> jquery: master timmywil * b8fc9d1 (1 files in 1 dirs): detachEvent is unnecessary since we're nulling div. Fixes #8873. - http://bit.ly/jS9mYo
[12:09:25] <timmywil> tests pass
[12:09:43] <rwaldron> hot shit
[12:11:01] <rwaldron> wow

[12:11:13] <rwaldron> who would've thought?
[12:11:19] <rwaldron> i'm glad we made that decision
[12:11:26] <timmywil> hehe yea, was thinking that myself
[12:15:25] <jqcommit> jquery: master rwldrn * 408c98f (3 files in 2 dirs): Landing pull request 383. Relocating jQuery.camelCase to core; Fixes #9368. ... - http://bit.ly/k4fC5T

[12:21:31] <timmywil> ok, im done
[13:39:34] <addyosmani> hey jaubourg
[13:39:42] <jaubourg> hey addy, sup?
[13:39:46] <addyosmani> hows the weather on your side of the room?
[13:39:54] <jaubourg> not bad, on yourse?
[13:40:01] <addyosmani> pretty good man, pretty good
[13:40:10] <addyosmani> we could use a little more lighting
[13:40:17] <jaubourg> altitude's not a problem
[13:40:19] <jaubourg> ?µ
[13:40:20] <jaubourg> ?
[13:40:23] <bot-t> jaubourg, jQuery API - A string containing the jQuery version number. http://api.jquery.com/
[13:40:24] <addyosmani> definitely not
[13:40:47] <addyosmani> bot-t: are you high?
[13:40:48] <bot-t> addyosmani, Most likely.
[13:40:52] <addyosmani> I thought so
[13:42:38] <jaubourg> ping?
[14:11:36] <eddiemonge> JohnResig or kswedberg do you know how to add an example to an option on http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Dialog
[14:14:20] <kswedberg> eddiemonge: sorry, man. I haven't done that. maybe rworth or scott gonzalez knows?
[14:15:06] <eddiemonge> lol scott doesnt know how either. he said to ask John
[14:18:56] <kswedberg> hrm
[14:22:39] <JohnResig> ugh... that was... a long time ago
[14:24:19] <eddiemonge> JohnResig: btw, did you see my question about testswarm.org?
[14:24:43] <JohnResig> nope
[14:25:37] <JohnResig> looking now
[14:25:58] <JohnResig> I'll transfer it to my personal account for now
[14:27:16] <JohnResig> eddiemonge: ok, I think I may have the domain now
[14:34:31] <eddiemonge> im not sure what the dns needs to point to but once its pointed at the same server as http://swarm.jquery.org then itll be good
[15:47:54] <timmywil> oo, i have an idea
[15:48:15] <timmywil> wouldn't this be equivalent to jQuery.isNaN ==> isNaN( parseInt( obj ) )
[15:49:09] <timmywil> wouldn't need the regex and it's smaller :)
[15:52:20] <timmywil> i'll do some perf tests
[15:53:41] <eddiemonge> wouldnt that always be false?
[15:53:56] <timmywil> eddiemonge: ?
[15:54:21] <eddiemonge> doesnt parseInt() return a number?
[15:54:43] <timmywil> eddiemonge: well NaN is technically a number
[15:55:06] <timmywil> but yes, it returns NaN is returned for strings, null, undefined, everything we check
[15:55:41] <eddiemonge> ?eval parseInt('hell0')
[15:55:41] <bot-t> eddiemonge: NaN
[15:56:50] <rwaldron> timmywil appear there are no tests in test/unit/core.js
[15:57:57] <timmywil> rwaldron: good point
[15:58:22] <rwaldron> you need to either a. write tests (best option)
[15:58:28] <rwaldron> b. run data and dimensions
[15:58:33] <rwaldron> and whatever else i havent found yet
[16:00:35] <rwaldron> timmywil the closest winner is:
[16:00:42] <rwaldron> return !parseFloat( obj )
[16:00:46] <rwaldron> but that fucks up on this:
[16:00:50] <rwaldron> parseFloat("5..5")
[16:00:58] <rwaldron> which is a test in data
[16:01:48] <timmywil> ah nice catch
[16:02:05] <timmywil> oh well, pipe dreams
[16:02:22] <rwaldron> but it was a _cool_ pipe dream
[16:02:45] <timmywil> thanks ;)
[16:06:40] <rwaldron> timmywil did we determine that https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/384 was a no go?
[16:07:21] <timmywil> ah yea
[16:11:06] <timmywil> closed
[16:12:53] <rwaldron> word
[16:13:04] <rwaldron> i gotta run dawggy dog
[16:13:12] <rwaldron> i'll catch ya on the flipside
