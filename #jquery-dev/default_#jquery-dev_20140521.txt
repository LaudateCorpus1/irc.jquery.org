[09:18:39] <Krinkle> Lol, amazing this ever worked
[09:19:00] <Krinkle> $foo.before( $('<input>').after( $('<label>' ) )
[09:19:07] <Krinkle> bug: label is no longer being inserted
[09:19:10] <Krinkle> worked in 1.8
[09:19:15] <Krinkle> no way, that should never have worked
[09:19:20] <Krinkle> can't insert after a detached node
[09:19:25] <Krinkle> or maybe it was using a fragment
[09:19:34] <Krinkle> fixed, but a tough one to track down
[09:19:49] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: believe it or not, that used to work but it was kind of by accident
[09:19:54] <Krinkle> yeah
[09:20:13] <Krinkle> ugh, I like jquery's stability a lot, but maybe a bit too much.
[09:20:18] <DaveMethvin> so on detached nodes, before/after kind of acted like array insertions
[09:20:23] <Krinkle> I like we're drifting a way from the 'tolerate all the crap'
[09:20:32] <Krinkle> away*
[09:20:52] <Krinkle> There is so much code out there that just happens to work, being held together by virtually nothing
[09:21:09] <Krinkle> and then *snap* when you upgrade jQuery even with migration
[09:21:46] <DaveMethvin> my favorite is: what does $(variable) do?
[09:22:01] <Krinkle> Even harder because there's lots of plugins and community-engineered scripts they virally share between them. There is no concept of "oh, just fix this every where before you deploy the update"
[09:22:07] <DaveMethvin> well it selects elements, or creates new elements, or sets a ready handler, or ....
[09:22:09] <Krinkle> (at Wikipedia)
[09:22:16] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: yeah, love it :)
[09:22:26] <Krinkle> I'm using $.ready as a promise quite often
[09:22:31] <Krinkle> where I used to nest closures
[09:22:46] <Krinkle> e.g. $(function () { require('foo', ...)
[09:22:58] <Krinkle> $.when( $.ready, mw.load('foo') ).done( .. )
[09:23:28] <Krinkle> or rather, mw.load('foo', function () { $(function () { .. 
[09:23:31] <Krinkle> is what it was
[09:23:48] <gibson042> what is the sound of one hand clapping? where does a thought go when it is finished? what does $(variable) do? do not ask such questions
[09:23:59] <Krinkle> :D
[09:24:01] <DaveMethvin> ommmmm
[09:24:28] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Not to forget $(object that is not an element)
[09:24:35] <Krinkle> for hacky event and data handling
[09:25:06] <DaveMethvin> 2006 was a different time :)
[09:25:13] <Krinkle> Which is essentially a way to do Base.mixin(object.constructor, EventEmitter) Base.mixin(object.constructor, DataStore)
[09:25:14] <Krinkle> or something like that
[09:25:27] <Krinkle> But with $(), so it has to be good
[16:59:19] <leobalter> jzaefferer: https://github.com/leobalter/qunit-migrate
[17:00:50] <leobalter> I forked jquery-migrate and created this migration tool.
