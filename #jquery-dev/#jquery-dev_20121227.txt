[09:54:31] <DaveMethvin> .
[09:54:40] <DaveMethvin> snover: hey dere!
[09:54:48] <snover> DaveMethvin: hey der
[09:55:03] <DaveMethvin> so you have a test cathedral now?
[09:55:05] <snover> yes
[09:55:15] <DaveMethvin> let me worship there
[09:55:24] <snover> you’re welcome to it
[09:55:49] <snover> As it turns out, only about 1/3rd of the WebDriver drivers actually support execute_async so I am reworking the way test results get passed back
[09:56:12] <snover> once that’s done, it should work on all platforms
[09:56:29] <snover> also that work will pave the way to finish up the automated functional testing
[09:56:38] <snover> but it’s really easy to set up and use
[09:56:38] <snover> so
[09:56:49] <snover> feel free to take it for a…test…drive…
[09:56:49] <snover> …
[09:56:54] <snover> https://github.com/csnover/dojo2-teststack
[09:57:00] <snover> is the repo with the stuff
[09:57:04] <DaveMethvin> ah ok
[09:57:58] <snover> if you do want to use it but keep your existing qunit tests it should be pretty easy to adapt those
[09:58:07] <snover> pluggable interfaces (like mocha)
[09:58:16] <snover> (except better because you can use more than one interface)
[10:01:29] <Ikloss> test
[11:55:30] <Ikloss> not much activity today 
[12:06:31] <Ikloss> test
[12:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ikloss: You can stop testing.
