[07:44:49] <scott_gonzalez> ?tell miketaylr I just filed DSK-351700 and wondering if there are any workarounds, originally filed against UI: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/7577
[07:44:49] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Okay.
[07:48:16] <miketaylr> thanks scott_gonzalez--i'll ping our forms guy
[07:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[07:48:28] <miketaylr> weird bug
[07:48:33] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:49:16] <scott_gonzalez> even weirder is that in the dialog example, I was able to avoid the bug by removing a property on the widget instance
[07:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> which seems completely unrelated
[07:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> it was just a flag for whether the dialog was open or closed
[14:54:14] <paul_irish> request for more docs on .on() http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8333815/how-to-translate-jquery-live-to-on-with-events-bound-to-this
[14:54:23] <paul_irish> aaron is a good guy
[14:55:48] <ajpiano> people write plugins that do $.fn.foo = function() { return this.live("click", fn);  } ???
[14:56:06] <ajpiano> because $(this).live() has never worked in any version of jquery
[14:56:19] <ajpiano> for arbitrary elements
[14:57:33] <ajpiano> and .on() doesn't say anything about a jQuery object being something you can pass as an arg
[14:58:06] <ajpiano> i don't think DaveMethvin or anyone will be too interested in doccing use of 'this.selector'
[14:58:41] <ajpiano> a plugin that does live is really weird to me though
[15:03:13] <ajpiano> paul_irish: it feels like cheating
[15:03:18] <paul_irish> ok
[15:03:32] <ajpiano> like he's trying to get the 'match this selector in the future magically' behaviour
[15:03:35] <ajpiano> that we're trying to make go away
[15:05:39] <aaronmcadam> it's undocced for a reason then so
[15:49:07] <DaveMethvin> .
[15:49:40] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: thanks on the this.selector, and I agree we don't want to document it ... i've replied over there
[16:08:56] <danzik17> hey jaubourg - mind if i pm u?  easier to carry on that cors questiono there than 140 chars at a time =P
[16:10:20] <jaubourg> yeah, seems like a good idea ;)
[16:36:52] <mikesherov> paul_irish: you here?
[16:37:37] <paul_irish> .
[16:37:56] <mikesherov> I'd love to hear your opinion on this: https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=73334
[16:38:02] <mikesherov> if you have time that is :-)
[16:41:18] <mikesherov> switching to mobile as _
[16:48:43] <paul_irish> sounds bad.
[16:48:50] <paul_irish> um
[16:48:53] <paul_irish> thats bad
[16:49:26] <mikesherov> Ha
[16:50:10] <mikesherov> So I reported it www-style so that CSSOM can figure it out.
[16:50:14] <paul_irish> mikesherov: i cc'd in julian and jarred
[16:50:18] <paul_irish> k
[16:51:08] <mikesherov> But as far as webkit goes, this forces jquery to do "dean Edwards awesome hack" for chrome
[16:51:29] <paul_irish> nasty
[16:51:47] <paul_irish> mikesherov: since its from sencha i wonder if it bit their js devs
[16:51:58] <paul_irish> might want to ping subtlegradient
[16:52:04] <paul_irish> mikesherov: you on twitter?
[16:52:09] <mikesherov> And the margin:auto thing, I think IE9 is right, and FF, O, webkit are wrong
[16:52:23] <mikesherov> Yes, I'm @mikesherov on twitter
[16:53:19] <mikesherov> IMO, margin:auto should report >0 if that's what's used
[16:53:44] <paul_irish> tweeted him
[16:53:50] <paul_irish> cc'd u
[16:54:16] <mikesherov> Cool, who is that?
[16:54:27] <paul_irish> good guy
[16:54:31] <paul_irish> mootools sencha hacker
[16:55:48] <mikesherov> Cool, the percent/pixel thing was explicitly done in a previous ticket that's linked from my ticket.
[16:56:22] <paul_irish> i can't look into the details myself right now
[16:56:53] <mikesherov> No prob. Thanks for the link up. I gotta run anyway.
[16:57:30] <mikesherov> I just wanted to get it to you, knew you'd know the right person. Thanks again.
[17:20:24] <paul_irish> bot-t: tell mikesherov https://twitter.com/#!/jarrednicholls/status/142049583915204608 BOOOOM
[17:20:25] <bot-t> paul_irish, Okay.

[19:48:22] <mikesherov> :-)
[19:48:47] <mikesherov> DaveMethvin: you here?
[19:49:07] <DaveMethvin> hey mikesherov
[19:49:32] <mikesherov> So looks like that nasty "awesome hack by dean edwards" chrome thing may not be necessary
[19:49:42] <mikesherov> well, it's be necessary for safari still
[19:49:50] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah i saw that
[19:50:13] <DaveMethvin> it will take a lot longer for safari to fix i suspect
[19:50:50] <DaveMethvin> i got involved in some work stuff which is keeping me busy this week so i decided to
[19:51:03] <DaveMethvin> wait for a while to land stuff
[19:51:12] <mikesherov> No problem
[19:51:12] <DaveMethvin> seems pretty quiet the last couple of days
[19:51:18] <mikesherov> We all get busy
[19:51:29] <DaveMethvin> so i suspect everryone else is doing "real work" too :D
[19:51:33] <mikesherov> I was quiet too because didn't want to overwhelm the queue
[19:51:49] <mikesherov> and busy fenagling chrome and www-style to fix that bug for real
[19:52:02] <DaveMethvin> always better to push it onto someone else's plate
[19:52:05] <DaveMethvin> whenever possible
[19:52:18] <DaveMethvin> especially when it's not OUR fault
[19:52:18] <mikesherov> for sure
[19:52:22] <mikesherov> agreed
[19:53:29] <mikesherov> It's really nice to be able to come on here, ping paul_irish about it
[19:53:40] <mikesherov> and have him jump on twitter to get it done
[19:53:47] <mikesherov> Wish all changes were that easy
[19:54:08] <DaveMethvin> yep, would be nice
[19:54:22] <DaveMethvin> really at this point the slowest response is with ie
[19:54:51] <DaveMethvin> even if they want to fix something it's 18 months so that often means ppl are comign to us for workarounds
[19:56:04] <mikesherov> right, at this point, it's reasonable that Chrome, FF, and Safari and O could have a fix in just months
[19:56:20] <mikesherov> and FF and Chrome auto update easily
