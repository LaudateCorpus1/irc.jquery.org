[06:47:06] <Krinkle> Anyone here developer in jQuery Mobile? Someone needs to start looking at the testswarm results. jQuery Mobile is messing up the swarm with a lot of load. Many small commits, huge test suite, but with many failures and time outs which are all going to be re-ran 4 times. Whenever a "serious commit" (no pun intended) comes in it takes ages before it's backlog is tested due to the huge mobile stuff
[06:47:21] <Krinkle> practically everything in mobile is failing right now in some way in some browser

[11:30:44] <ben_alman> anyone who is interested, install grunt 0.3.1, cd to a new folder, and put "grunt init:jquery" through its paces
[11:31:02] <ben_alman> ajpiano: i tried to address all the plugin json / rules stuff
