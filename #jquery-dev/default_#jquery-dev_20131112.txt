[07:15:30] <m_gol> gibson042: are you here?
[07:16:14] <gibson042> m_gol: not really; I'm technically present but don't have much time for jQuery today
[07:16:37] <m_gol> gibson042: just wanted to ask why is there an empty merge commit on master ;)
[07:16:38] <gibson042> is it about the ajaxLocation PR?
[07:16:43] <gibson042> hmmm
[07:16:55] <m_gol> e8e53a6bb579938e0280724b7e84260589918cf2
[07:16:58] <m_gol> last but one
[07:17:42] <gibson042> huh
[07:17:48] <gibson042> I don't know how that happened
[07:17:57] <m_gol> I could squash it but not sure if it's an OK thing to do since it's already on master
[07:18:23] <gibson042> no, we definitely don't want to do that
[07:18:27] <gibson042> once it's in, it's in
[07:18:30] <m_gol> ok
[07:18:54] <gibson042> I'll pay closer attention next time and see if something similar crops up again, though
[07:19:44] <m_gol> :)
[07:20:08] <m_gol> I didn't know it's possible to merge a branch with itself, hehe
[07:26:21] <gibson042> me neither
[08:31:55] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ping
[08:50:52] <m_gol> trac is down

[12:18:24] <Krinkle> Hm.. bug? or missing feature?
[12:18:24] <Krinkle> http://jsfiddle.net/fvFC4/
[12:18:36] <Krinkle> overflow: hidden; does not influence is(':visible')
[12:18:44] <Krinkle> for children that are completely in the offset
[12:18:48] <Krinkle> overflow*
[12:19:14] <m_gol> the latter
[12:32:16] <Krinkle> m_gol: Do you know whether this has been brought up in the past?
[12:32:25] <m_gol> no idea
[12:32:36] <Krinkle> I'm looking for various snippets on the net that would help me cover this case.
[12:33:08] <Krinkle> It's mostly for statistical reasons using smoketesting, we'd like to find out client-side if there are any elements in the article content caught in overflow.
[12:33:50] <m_gol> I'm not sure, though, if our code doesn't rely on that behavior for .animate()
[13:59:24] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle: It's intentional.
[13:59:44] <scott_gonzalez> Would you expect an element that's far down the page to not match :visible because it's not in the viewport?
[13:59:46] <Krinkle> Right, because it's not just for hidden overflow, but also scrollable overflow
[14:00:25] <Krinkle> and an element with overflow hidden and no scroll controls,, can still be scrolled programmatically.

[21:54:25] <Krinkle> Pop quiz. Given a === b and f(a) !== f(b); a and b are both numbers, f is a function using only mathematics. What are a, b and f?
[21:54:26] <Krinkle> I'll give the answer in PM to any impatient bystanders.
[22:00:38] <Krinkle> also f(a) === f(a)
