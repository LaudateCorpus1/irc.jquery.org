[05:39:27] <m_gol> we have the first Android run on master: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2641
[05:39:43] <m_gol> obviously, there are problems with effects...
[05:40:25] <DaveMethvin> maybe the same problem as old IE
[05:40:33] <DaveMethvin> but at least the test is set up
[05:40:49] <m_gol> yup
[05:40:57] <DaveMethvin> and other than manipulation on 2.3 it doesn't look too bad
[05:41:00] <m_gol> and we see clearly what's messed up in 2.3
[05:41:39] <m_gol> I'll try to rerun those interrupted runs one by one to not throttle other projects too much
[05:41:45] <m_gol> we'll see how many bugs there really are
[05:42:03] <m_gol> in other news, NOW we have a big array :D http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[05:42:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i saw the infra ticket ... putting those somewhere else would keep things clean
[05:45:44] <m_gol> I can delete these runs from the jQuery project once there is a separate project set up and it runs at least once
[05:45:57] <m_gol> so that we have a run to look at before it's ready
[05:46:11] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would be great
[05:46:27] <DaveMethvin> and ie7 ran okay, maybe it just wanted a new home
[05:46:30] <m_gol> when we remove IE6/7, it won't be so easy to distinguish which runs are from 1.x and which from master on the weekly run
[05:46:34] <m_gol> haha
[05:46:43] <m_gol> with not so many neighbors
[05:46:44] <m_gol> selfish one
[05:46:54] <DaveMethvin> we'll still have ie8 on 1.x
[05:47:01] <DaveMethvin> so it should stick out enough
[05:47:17] <m_gol> but not on a weekly job
[05:49:30] <m_gol> for most of the time even ones will be from one branch and odd ones from 1.x-master
[05:49:38] <m_gol> but it won't be visible at first glance
[05:49:51] <m_gol> maybe it's not a big problem
[05:50:01] <m_gol> we could always duplicate IE8 in the weekly job just to stick out, lol :P
[05:50:28] <DaveMethvin> i guess we'll figure out something if it gets to be confusing
[05:50:47] <m_gol> yup, better not to overengineer before it's ready
[05:50:55] <m_gol> sorry for missing the meeting, time zones got to me :P
[05:51:16] <DaveMethvin> oh that's right, anne mentioned that too
[05:51:19] <m_gol> and my IRC client was supposed to auto-connect on disconnecting, didn't work
[05:51:24] <m_gol> maybe we should switch to UTC
[05:51:29] <m_gol> then everyone will have a problem ;p
[05:51:33] <DaveMethvin> haha
[05:51:43] <DaveMethvin> lately my irc client has been doing that too
[05:51:50] <DaveMethvin> i guess they're having some DoS issues
[05:52:11] <m_gol> my temporary internet at work is disconnecting me from time to time
[05:52:20] <m_gol> btw, I have mixed feelings about fake timers...
[05:52:42] <m_gol> I mean, it's great to speed things up but if we speed the test run and then spend days figuring out what's broken...
[05:53:14] <m_gol> I don't want to spend a lot more time on it since TestSwarm is going away, I hope Karma will solve the issue but if not we'll have to get back to the topic
[05:53:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah,  it seems to be related to swarm, i'm hoping moving off that will fix it
[05:53:31] <m_gol> because effectively we now don't test effects on each commit since it interrupts
[05:53:48] <DaveMethvin> and if we  had to go back to setTimeout we could, since now we've removed the slowest browsers
[05:53:59] <m_gol> yup
[05:54:15] <m_gol> how's the Karma work going?
[05:54:25] <m_gol> the PR for Sizzle has been ready for some time, right?
[05:55:05] <DaveMethvin> i haven't been paying attention, once the .1s are out we'll have to figure out what to land
[05:56:18] <m_gol> k
[06:18:46] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: it seems you've been trolled
[06:39:27] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: when do you want to ship .1s? I'd like to look and the cross-xml issue (i.e. rewrite the tests properly), not sure about the timeframe
[06:39:36] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: or is sb else on it?
[06:42:35] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: i don't think anyone took the x-domain stuff, if you have time that would be great
[06:42:50] <m_gol> k
[06:43:08] <DaveMethvin> we can ship the .1s at the end of the month if everything goes well, depends on how the beta looks
[06:43:20] <m_gol> ah, ok, so there's some time
[06:43:33] <m_gol> the test stuff doesn't happen before the beta as it's tests only
[06:43:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's not as critical, altho it would be nice if we passed more tests :)
[06:44:06] <m_gol> haha, right
[06:44:24] <m_gol> I've re-scheduled ajax tests in Android 2.3
[06:44:27] <m_gol> boy, it takes ages
[06:44:56] <m_gol> the core error looks different than effects ones

[07:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: What happened?
[07:20:37] <m_gol> I mean the "jQuery UI is all bad" drama
[07:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well David Mark is a lunatic.
[07:32:22] <scott_gonzalez> I've known that for years.
[07:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing I say or don't say will change that.
[07:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> It's pretty awesome how he blames the health care disaster on jQuery.
[07:32:57] <DaveMethvin> oh but scott, don't you know that jQuery used to browser sniff in 2008 and that's why it sucks today?
[07:33:45] <DaveMethvin> if the world had used My Library we would be so much better now and Crimea would still be in the hands of the Ukranians
[07:34:47] <scott_gonzalez> If we could just get browsers to remove that horrible getComputedStyle() function, the world would be a better place.
[07:37:21] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: +1
