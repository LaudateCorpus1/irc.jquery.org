[07:06:00] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I was just about to mark  that ticket as valid
[07:06:10] <timmywil> did we decide we shouldn't throw an error?
[07:06:29] <DaveMethvin> ie8 throws the error
[07:06:39] <DaveMethvin> we let the others do it when they can
[07:06:59] <DaveMethvin> http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#quot-input-quot-attr-quot-type-quot-newvalue-in-oldie
[07:07:01] <timmywil> yea, but that's why we threw the error before
[07:07:21] <timmywil> oh right
[07:07:26] <timmywil> ok, we did say that
[07:07:38] <DaveMethvin> let me add a link to that
[07:08:04] <timmywil> My initial reaction was that it was an accident caused by moving the attributes code to Sizzle
[07:08:19] <timmywil> but I'm less concerned if it is written down

[07:17:54] <DaveMethvin> let
[07:18:03] <DaveMethvin> 's see whether anyone cares about it
[07:18:24] <DaveMethvin> if it's like the 1.x/2.x we'll get all kind of crazies
[07:19:37] <timmywil> I think you'd have to not read it all to make a big fuss, but we'll see.
