[06:54:25] <JamesMGreene> Label label blah blah blah, jqcommit  >:-|
[06:54:52] <jzaefferer> hehe
[06:55:01] <JamesMGreene> So annoying
[06:56:31] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: even if we keep expect(), #668 is a useful outcome of that discussion
[06:57:15] <JamesMGreene> #668 is useful, just not something I thought was in scope
[06:57:19] <jzaefferer> Fixing that should help make tests more deterministic, like many of the changes we've been doing
[06:57:36] <JamesMGreene> Also likely to be a gotcha for some users but I think they'll get over it with a decent error message
[06:58:38] <jzaefferer> Yeah, should be okay when switching to assert.async()
[07:05:57] <jqcommit> [13qunit] 15jzaefferer closed issue #538: loading tests asynchronsly results in unpredictable execution of test via the rerun button or the url parameter "testNumber=x" 02http://git.io/j-TPHw
[07:07:01] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: so at least the partial fix for #668 should go in 1.16. Anything else, now that testId is in?

[07:10:00] <JamesMGreene> ^ Discussion needed
[07:13:39] <JamesMGreene> We should also probably bring back the `assert.raises` alias in `v1.x`

[07:25:20] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: thanks. Provided some input on these open discussions
[07:26:34] <jzaefferer> We could just create a 1.16 milestone...
[07:27:53] <JamesMGreene> Did we do any pre-1.16 work (e.g. v1.15.x stuff) against the existing "pre-2.0" milestone?  If not, we can just rename that one
[07:52:06] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: pre-2.0 has 10 closed issues
[07:53:03] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: unrelated, I was looking at https://github.com/js-reporters/js-reporters/issues/3#issuecomment-56175750 - it seems like an example or two using a coverage reporter without it emitting events, but some alternative API, could help move that discussion forward
