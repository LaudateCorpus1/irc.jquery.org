[05:49:27] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: @Cinsoft: Can sum up history of #jQueryUI as the blind (Resig) leading the blind (cargo cult members) leading the dregs (think health care site) :(#js
[06:01:08] <scott_gonzalez> It's amazing how wrong this whole write up is: https://gist.github.com/cinsoft/9402989
[06:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> Well, to be fair, I only go through the first half. But literally everything he says is wrong.

[10:04:05] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: lol, did the meeting last 3 minutes? :D
[10:07:41] <m_gol> ah, crap, did the time zone change in the US?
[10:07:52] <m_gol> that would explain why I missed the meeting (no zone change in Europe...)
[10:08:01] <gibson042> damn m_gol; yeah
[10:08:17] <m_gol> time zones such :-)
[10:08:47] <gibson042> yep
[10:08:49] <m_gol> and I was there, it's just my IRC disconnected and I didn't think it'll be until 18:00 CET
[10:08:56] <m_gol> * such -> suck
[10:09:54] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: those iOS6 errors weren't stable, I reset some tests on swarm.jquery.org and they passed
[10:10:26] <m_gol> generally speaking, we fail a lot of runs for most of the time, it's just that I try to reset them and most of them work at the second try (except IE 6-9)
[10:11:31] <m_gol> hopefully it'll improve when we switch to Karma but if we were to keep fighting with it in TestSwarm, I'd even be for reverting the fake timers if that would solve the issue; we've wasted a lot of time on these problems
[10:11:45] <m_gol> DaveMethvin ^^^
[10:16:06] <timmywil> Not sure why I was disconnected from IRC. grrr
[10:20:21] <m_gol> gibson042: I wouldn't land https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1527 as the resetting the style will be reverted anyway
[10:21:42] <gibson042> yep
[10:21:44] <gibson042> I'll close it
[10:22:46] <m_gol> with your and my patch the code would get pretty complicated :-)
[10:22:58] <m_gol> 100 edge cases
[10:23:18] <m_gol> the test seems worthy landing, though
[10:24:08] <m_gol> I'll get to this reverting soon, just need to eat sth first ;)

[12:44:30] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14872 is about $( document ).attr( "title" ) working on document.title even though it's not an attribute.
[12:45:26] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically we're running $( document ).attr( "title", "" )
[12:48:56] <DaveMethvin> well don't do that!
[12:49:39] <m_gol> ;)
[12:49:40] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we're doing `element.attr( "title", "" )` :-P
[12:50:20] <DaveMethvin> it should work fine from document.body
[12:50:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but everyone loves document :-)
[12:51:29] <DaveMethvin> can anything but nodeType 1 have attributes? document is 9
[12:51:59] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not.
[12:52:53] <DaveMethvin> it's fine to delegate at document (well not but that's another story) but you'd need to change tooltip to not use anything AT document
[12:53:08] <DaveMethvin> or just change the example to document.body
[12:56:06] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...I'm actually not sure why this code is even running.
[12:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to trace this some more.

[12:58:21] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: the weekly job created :)
[12:58:25] <m_gol> * jobs
[12:58:37] <DaveMethvin> yay, thanks m_gol!
[12:58:48] <m_gol> I added only Opera 12.1x, Safari 5.1 & IE6/7 for now
[12:59:11] <m_gol> I have a couple of remarks at https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/242
[12:59:22] <m_gol> once those get resolved, I can start adding Androids
[12:59:34] <m_gol> can I remove those IE6/7 etc. from regular jobs now?
[12:59:48] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah! looking forward to that
[12:59:55] <m_gol> I sheduled weekly jobs to run on Tuesdays for master & Wednesdays for 1.x-master
[13:00:06] <m_gol> on 1 a.m. Jenkins Time (which is PST AFAIK)
[13:00:06] <DaveMethvin> sounds good
[13:00:16] <DaveMethvin> it should be quiet then
[13:00:26] <m_gol> I wanted to catch USA & Europe :)
[13:00:44] <m_gol> 1 a.m. + 9h is 10 a.m. so traffic shouldn't be high anyway
[13:00:58] <m_gol> ok, removing in progress!
[13:01:10] <m_gol> can't wait to not have to wait for IE6 on every single commit :)
