[16:52:03] <briligg> Hi. The Themeroller page is just showing a bunch of latin text. Is it down?
[16:53:19] <robertmaxrees> briligg oh, that's just lorem ipsum.
[17:08:17] <briligg> there's nothing else there. nothing on the page does anything, there's nothing but some headings that are links but don't go anywhere, and the placeholder text
[17:08:56] <briligg> that got cut off - the page isn't doing anything. 
[17:13:20] <DaveMethvin> briligg: You haven't said whether it's jQuery UI or Mobile, but both work for me. Here's what I see: http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/93ba06.png http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/67c257.png
[17:13:24] <DaveMethvin> both seem fine
[17:13:27] <DaveMethvin> in chrome
[17:14:54] <briligg> jQuery UI. let me upload an image as well.
[17:15:05] <briligg> i'm on chrome too, ubuntu
[17:16:28] <briligg> http://imgur.com/JomHWap
[17:18:26] <DaveMethvin> you'll need to debug this further, it's working here so I suspect something is blocking script for example a firewall or ad blocker
[17:18:31] <DaveMethvin> did you look on the console?
[17:18:52] <briligg> no, let me open that
[17:20:22] <briligg> oh - https issue?
[17:20:45] <briligg> i've got https everywhere on
[17:21:32] <DaveMethvin> your console is probably showing you some words that I can't read, because what you're saying isn't making sense to me
[17:21:39] <DaveMethvin> your console says "https issue"?
[17:21:47] <DaveMethvin> i have never seen that
[17:22:04] <briligg> no, i'm sorry, i was tryin to summarize, to see if i could resolve quickly
[17:22:37] <briligg> it says the page was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure stylesheet
[17:22:49] <DaveMethvin> ok then that's breaking the pae
[17:22:50] <DaveMethvin> page
[17:24:28] <briligg> disabling the https extension hasn't helped
[17:24:58] <DaveMethvin> do you have another system you can use to check?
[17:25:03] <DaveMethvin> another browser maybe
[17:25:13] <DaveMethvin> something that doesn't have a bunch of plugins?
[17:25:46] <briligg> oh wait - refreshing wasn't enough
[17:26:11] <briligg> i went page to the previous page and clicked the link to it again, and it's opened fine
[17:26:28] <briligg> i think
[17:26:55] <DaveMethvin> in chrome, go to settings and tell it to disable caching when dev tools are open, that often helps
[17:29:51] <briligg> mmm, i'm searching through the settings... what section?
[17:31:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah they don't make it easy to find http://upload.wnd8.com/grab/e0fc30.png
[17:31:18] <DaveMethvin> too many damned settings :)
[17:32:26] <briligg> gee - mine doesn't look like that at all :P
[17:32:48] <DaveMethvin> what version of chrome?
[17:32:50] <briligg> are you on a different OS
[17:32:58] <briligg> it's for ubuntu
[17:33:26] <briligg> Version 46.0.2490.86 unknown (64-bit)
[17:33:36] <DaveMethvin> chrome 46 windows  has that
[17:33:52] <DaveMethvin> kinda surprised that's not across platforms tho
[17:34:25] <DaveMethvin> well if you're having issues and Chrome is that diff, you will probably need to find another Ubuntu user
[17:34:31] <DaveMethvin> but in general i think this is working
[17:34:41] <DaveMethvin> so it's most likely something about your config
[17:34:54] <briligg> http://imgur.com/pdLeZKH
[17:35:34] <DaveMethvin> that's Chrome settings not Dev Tools settings
[17:35:46] <DaveMethvin> Press F12 or whatever Ubuntu might do
[17:36:07] <DaveMethvin> and then click the three dots on the right or whereever Ubuntu puts them
[17:36:10] <DaveMethvin> and you shoudl see that menu
[17:36:24] <briligg> ooooh...
[17:36:43] <briligg> i'm still getting used to even using the dev console
[17:36:54] <briligg> who's name i now know :]
[17:37:11] <DaveMethvin> there's like a whole new world there, moar settings
[17:37:37] <briligg> alright, i think i'm good for now. thanks for your help :)
[17:37:44] <DaveMethvin> ok good luck!
