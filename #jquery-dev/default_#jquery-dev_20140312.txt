[05:34:17] <JamesMGreene> Heeeeey trusted Mac-based devs: what's the best IRC client for Mac (and why)?
[05:34:56] <m_gol> I use Linkinus but I don't recommend it ;)
[05:35:08] <m_gol> it's supposed to reconnect me automatically on disconnection and it doesn't
[05:35:32] <JamesMGreene> Seeing the most online recommendations for Colloquy
[05:36:23] <JamesMGreene> Looks... eh, OK
[05:40:15] <JamesMGreene> Other than that, looking at LimeChat or Textual
[05:40:30] <JamesMGreene> Linkinus and Adium are out, AFAIAC
[05:41:48] <m_gol> JamesMGreene: let me know if you find sth good, I need to switch myself :)
[05:42:39] <JamesMGreene> LimeChat looks somewhat familiar given I was using mIRC on Windows
[05:45:34] <JamesMGreene> I'm going to try Colloquy first
[05:47:12] <JamesMGreene> Testing talk talk talk
[05:48:52] <JamesMGreene> Testing some more
[05:49:13] <JamesMGreene> Hmm, interesting theme options. Not bad.

[08:32:40] <JamesMGreene> 'Awesome, Colloquy isn't showing what I'm typing
[08:33:12] <JamesMGreene> Great first impression :-P
[08:33:30] <JamesMGreene> jzaefferer:  Krinkle|detached  leobalte1  scott_gonzalez : I can't meet today
[08:34:08] <JamesMGreene> Updates: working on an enhancement to qunit-assert-close, per QUnit Issue #539
[08:34:31] <JamesMGreene> also did some research into existing reporter interfaces for other test fra frameworks (namely Mocha and Jasmine)
[08:34:48] <jzaefferer> JamesMGreene: yeah, research on reporter interfaces are looking good, I haven't looked at the details yet though
[08:35:03] <JamesMGreene> https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/531
[08:35:21] <JamesMGreene> They're both different so I'm not sure where to go next :-P
[08:35:31] <JamesMGreene> unless we want to actually appeal to standardize
[08:36:04] <JamesMGreene> Is that what you were thinking, jzaefferer ?
[08:36:09] <JamesMGreene> Issue would suggest probably so
[08:36:44] <jzaefferer> Yeah, we should do that
[08:37:03] <jzaefferer> At least create issues on each project and see if they show any interest
[08:39:13] <snover> there are already so many standards here
[08:41:57] <jzaefferer> snover: like what?
[08:47:46] <snover> junit xml and tap are the most commonly consumed output â€˜standardsâ€™ for test results
[08:48:04] <jzaefferer> snover: related examples I can think of are the "junit xml" format and TAP (as in Test Anything Protocol), but both are output formats, not a reporter interface; neither seem to have a spec, just implementations
[08:48:46] <snover> junit has some xsds, tap has http://testanything.org/tap-specification.html
[08:49:04] <jzaefferer> if you look at https://github.com/jquery/qunit/issues/531 - the first bullet is about JUnit and TAP, we were mostly talking about the second bullet: "need a list of events that provide this data. Something like done should provide the full datastructure, other events should help to output progress "
[08:49:07] <snover> and http://testanything.org/tap-version-13-specification.html
[08:49:45] <snover> sorry, all i know is that i already did write a test framework that does a lot more than qunit
[08:53:22] <jzaefferer> well, thanks for the links
[08:56:54] <snover> there are also a myriad of xsds for validating junit xml output

[10:13:57] <snover> DaveMethvin: i thought it was shut down because jquery has no more bugs
[10:13:59] <snover> :)
[10:15:14] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: ping
[10:15:24] <DaveMethvin> hey m_gol 
[10:15:32] <m_gol> you needed me for sth
[10:15:45] <m_gol> hey :)
[10:15:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah mainly was gonna ask about the Angular project ... it seems like they are really backed up on PRs and issues?
[10:16:15] <m_gol> never ending story :)
[10:16:21] <DaveMethvin> did they declare bug bankruptcy last year? I remember seeing a blog post about it
[10:16:27] <DaveMethvin> but the list is even bigger now
[10:16:29] <m_gol> GitHub stops working good for projects with this activity
[10:16:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:16:52] <m_gol> yeah, they closed all the issues asking to reopen if the issue is still valud
[10:17:08] <DaveMethvin> looks like the project could really use some more triagers
[10:17:20] <DaveMethvin> i have some people asking me about Angular and that's my main concern
[10:17:26] <m_gol> this dashboard is used for the overview of PRs/issues etc. http://dashboard.angularjs.org/
[10:17:54] <m_gol> oops, it seems broken now ;)
[10:18:01] <m_gol> there are some new triagers
[10:18:13] <m_gol> they're also working on new tools to speed up the process
[10:18:33] <m_gol> there is also the fact that Angular 2 is being rewritten from scratch
[10:18:38] <DaveMethvin> yeah it's got to be crazy with all the activity
[10:18:51] <DaveMethvin> and i agree, github isn't good for a really busy project
[10:18:54] <m_gol> it's being written in ES6, will be using Object.observe & other new stuff
[10:19:07] <DaveMethvin> right, i think that's when things will get interesting
[10:19:10] <m_gol> currently work is spread out through different repositories with subprojects
[10:19:18] <DaveMethvin> once there is better support inside browsers
[10:19:34] <m_gol> yeah, for the start it's just going to be passed through Traceur
[10:19:46] <m_gol> but Chrome is already preparing to ship Object.observe for exampke
[10:19:53] <m_gol> even though it's planned for ES7
[10:20:30] <DaveMethvin> so is the current repo going to be changed? or are they starting fresh for 2.0?
[10:20:44] <m_gol> npm will be used for packaging but purely as a way to dump files, importing will be done via ES6 module imports/exports
[10:21:03] <m_gol> it's a complete rewrite, not sure if the repo is going to be switched
[10:21:07] <DaveMethvin> ooh, so shiny it can't possibly work for several years! :)
[10:21:14] <m_gol> but since the project has many small subprojects, probably not ;)
[10:21:18] <m_gol> ;)
[10:21:30] <m_gol> some stuff is being ported from AngularDart
[10:21:42] <DaveMethvin> well it's good to see some non-Google folks working on it
[10:21:49] <DaveMethvin> they need some other perspectives
[10:21:50] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: restarted (again)
[10:21:54] <DaveMethvin> thanks gnarf 
[10:22:21] <DaveMethvin> what you need to do is get snover to work on that backlog of PRs and issues
[10:22:29] <m_gol> Angular 2.0 is planned to work in IE11+ only (there will be IE12 before it ships considering the severity of the rewrite)
[10:22:35] <DaveMethvin> we were up at like 1500 before he banged them down
[10:22:35] <m_gol> haha
[10:22:45] <DaveMethvin> that makes sense
[10:22:57] <DaveMethvin> given that it's gonna use bleeding edge stuff not yet shipped
[10:23:05] <m_gol> I wish the jqLite went away ;)
[10:23:32] <m_gol> that's one reason I'm pushing to be able to create smaller builds without Sizzle etc. since they care about the size
[10:23:33] <snover> DaveMethvin: indirectly, i am working on it ;)
[10:23:40] <DaveMethvin> i'm not a big Angular fan right now just because the browsers don't handle this well and there are so many hacks inside Angular to work around that
[10:23:47] <DaveMethvin> so the 2.0 should fix much of that
[10:24:12] <DaveMethvin> and yeah it would be great if they used real jQuery
[10:24:50] <m_gol> esp. that they diverge a little in many ways
[10:25:06] <m_gol> some things in jQuery are only in event.originalEvent.sth and they dump it directly etc.
[10:25:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah, theirs isn't really compat
[10:25:23] <m_gol> if sb writes a module and tests it on jqLite only then sometimes it might not work with jQuery
[10:25:39] <m_gol> Angular is tested on both but external modules not necessarily
[10:26:11] <DaveMethvin> on the originalEvent thing I experimented with using Object.create(event) to create an object that inherits from the native event to avoid copying
[10:26:19] <DaveMethvin> works really nice in Webkit
[10:26:22] <DaveMethvin> FAILS everywhere else
[10:26:25] <m_gol> haha
[10:26:40] <m_gol> any specific reasons?
[10:26:47] <DaveMethvin> event is a host object
[10:26:58] <DaveMethvin> so it doesn't always follow ECMAScript rules
[10:27:21] <DaveMethvin> only Webkit (at least the recent ones) make it a full JS object
[10:27:25] <m_gol> ES6 is supposed to allow subclassing builtins, maybe some of these weird things get fixed then
[10:27:35] <m_gol> even Blink doesn't?
[10:27:40] <DaveMethvin> yay, maybe jQuery 4.0 " :)
[10:27:44] <DaveMethvin> blink does
[10:27:56] <DaveMethvin> yeah blink and recent webkit
[10:28:16] <m_gol> jQuery 4.0 forbidden keywords: var, function ;)
[10:28:21] <DaveMethvin> android 2.3 doesn't even have a standard event object, that's the one fail we have in the event unit tests
[10:28:27] <snover> you can inherit in firefox if you make sure you replace all the methods with ones that use the original event
[10:28:45] <DaveMethvin> oh, only the methods die?
[10:28:50] <DaveMethvin> but the props inherit?
[10:28:59] <DaveMethvin> i could live with that
[10:29:24] <snover> when you create the delegate youâ€™ve changed the `this ` object
[10:29:37] <DaveMethvin> ah
[10:29:39] <snover> so you need to make sure you are using the original host object
[10:30:08] <DaveMethvin> well i had to update those anyway since we need to know whether propagation is stopped
[10:30:50] <DaveMethvin> oh but when calling the original event's .stopPropagation() for example, you're saying I need to .call() it?
[10:31:01] <DaveMethvin> to pass in the original event?
[10:31:09] <DaveMethvin> i'll have to try that
[10:32:07] <m_gol> btw, turns out iOS7 passes on 1.x-master: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2655
[10:32:22] <m_gol> I added it, if it fails, it's better to be reminded of that constantly ;)
[10:32:39] <DaveMethvin> well that's fortunate, yeah add it if the news is good! :)
[10:34:24] <m_gol> gotta go for now, I'll look into Android 2.3 issues during the weekend
[10:34:34] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks m_gol

[17:59:47] <DaveMethvin> yep m_gol 
[18:00:11] <m_gol> you're going to love it
[18:00:26] <m_gol> we fail a test in iOS7 in doc ready...
[18:00:29] <m_gol> ...but only in 2.x
[18:00:46] <DaveMethvin> where's the part where I love it?? :)
[18:00:49] <m_gol> 100% reproducible
[18:01:00] <m_gol> :P
[18:01:11] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[18:01:20] <m_gol> from what I could tell, the 2.x code has just oldIE-specific weirdness removed
[18:01:29] <m_gol> (I mean 2.x ready code)
[18:01:36] <m_gol> no idea how this can affect iOS7...
[18:01:44] <m_gol> especially that it passes all the other tests :P
[18:02:17] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah,i see it
[18:04:02] <m_gol> unless the bug is not really in the ready code but e.g. in deffereds or sth
[18:04:21] <DaveMethvin> altho the test is timing dependent, it gives up after 3 seconds
[18:04:31] <DaveMethvin> i wonder if we're running into some sort of timer issue
[18:04:38] <m_gol> yes but it fails all the time and locally as well
[18:04:52] <m_gol> it hasn't passed for me even once
[18:04:56] <m_gol> for some time now
[18:05:10] <DaveMethvin> oh, see, i can't run Safari on Windows so i never noticed :P
[18:06:26] <DaveMethvin> wait m_gol shouldn't line 20 use $j() for doc ready?
[18:06:45] <DaveMethvin> oh no it's the just loaded copy i guess
[18:08:42] <m_gol> yup
[18:08:50] <m_gol> ok, I know why it doesn't fail in 1.x
[18:08:58] <m_gol> it's because this test is not there :P
[18:09:06] <DaveMethvin> WELL THAT EXPLAINS IT
[18:09:08] <m_gol> missing cherry-pick
[18:09:31] <m_gol> ok, let's make it fail in 1.x as well :P
[18:09:45] <DaveMethvin> we COULD fix it first! :D
[18:14:47] <m_gol> yup, this test fails on 1.x as well
[18:15:00] <m_gol> should I wait with cherry-picking
[18:15:01] <m_gol> ?
[18:15:09] <m_gol> our branches are out-of-sync ;)
[18:15:21] <DaveMethvin> ok go ahead and break it! 
[18:15:41] <DaveMethvin> someone with a mac will need to debug this
[18:15:45] <DaveMethvin> that's anyone but me i guess

[18:18:59] <DaveMethvin> yay, you breaked it!
[18:20:07] <DaveMethvin> it gave me a minute to realize that i need to update my patch here to fix the unit test for old IE
[18:20:20] <m_gol> \o/
[18:20:25] <m_gol> ok, now to fix it...
[18:20:48] <m_gol> btw, don't get fooled by all these green
[18:20:55] <m_gol> I've been restarting timeouted jobs
[18:21:07] <DaveMethvin> oh for the issues with effects?
[18:21:07] <m_gol> turns out it helps more after midnight :-D
[18:21:12] <m_gol> yup
[18:21:19] <m_gol> before midnight restarting doesn't help :P
[18:21:30] <DaveMethvin> the true definition of timing dependent problem
[18:21:43] <m_gol> but moving IE6/7 out of the regular set helped as well
[18:21:59] <m_gol> not only effects timeout, though
[18:21:59] <DaveMethvin> at least you have reduced the attack surface!
[18:22:03] <m_gol> see http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2660
[18:22:06] <m_gol> IE11 core error
[18:22:12] <m_gol> I'm sure when I restart it it'll pass
[18:22:42] <m_gol> Chrome 32 also often errors on ajax; restarting helps as well
[18:22:49] <DaveMethvin> interesting that it's the same test failing as iOS7 tho
[18:22:55] <DaveMethvin> may not be coincidence
[18:22:56] <m_gol> right...
[18:22:58] <m_gol> hm
[18:23:15] <m_gol> maybe 3s is too low for iOS7?
[18:23:22] <m_gol> but would it fail all the time? weird
[18:23:36] <DaveMethvin> well the other thing is that php-filled iframe is at 10s
[18:23:46] <DaveMethvin> so there are a lot of magic timings going on
[18:24:04] <DaveMethvin> moar flakey
[18:24:06] <m_gol> ah, 10s, not 3s
[18:24:19] <DaveMethvin> the fail timeout is 3s
[18:24:27] <DaveMethvin> but the iframe near the top is 10s
[18:24:47] <m_gol> right
[18:24:48] <DaveMethvin> so i assume the idea is for the iframe to not be loaded before the second jquery loads and fires ready
[18:24:53] <m_gol> can 10s be > than 3s? ;)
[18:25:02] <m_gol> I can put 100s there, it shouldn't matter
[18:25:07] <m_gol> yes
[18:25:08] <DaveMethvin> we're talking about testswarm, m_gol, so YEST
[18:25:12] <DaveMethvin> YES
[18:25:13] <m_gol> I wrote this test :)
[18:25:31] <m_gol> for TestSwarm - right, but on iOS 7 it fails locally on iOS simulator
[18:25:33] <m_gol> which is fast
[18:25:35] <DaveMethvin> i'd push the 10s to maybe 30s and make the timeout 10s
[18:25:39] <m_gol> incidentally, IE11 is also fast
[18:25:45] <m_gol> ok, I'll try
[18:26:07] <DaveMethvin> if everything goes okay it shoudl load quickly, its only going to hit 10s on error
[18:28:23] <m_gol> I bumped 3s to 10s for failure and 10s to 100s for the PHP script and iOS7 still fails
[18:28:29] <m_gol> it just takes it longer to fail :P
[18:28:42] <DaveMethvin> well that sounds like a real failure :(
[18:29:35] <m_gol> I guess I'll start debugging it from master
[18:29:38] <m_gol> less code to inspect
[18:29:46] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[18:30:12] <m_gol> I hope readyState isn't borked in iOS7 :/
[18:30:25] <snover> shall i get some more string and duct tape?
[18:31:02] <DaveMethvin> snover: we want our software to be robust, so we've moved to JB Weld
[18:31:46] <DaveMethvin> those apple fellas seem to do a really crappy job of finding bugs before they ship
[18:31:57] <DaveMethvin> at least when chrome breaks stuff they meant to do it
[18:32:05] <m_gol> why fix bugs when you can ship a new feature instead :P
[18:32:24] <m_gol> fixing browser bugs is for jQuery, right? ;P
[18:32:49] <snover> yes, ios7 webview is a disaster
[18:33:06] <snover> but, mostly, a manageable disaster
[18:33:21] <DaveMethvin> i loved this bug, the chrome guys pulled out a webkit-prefixed property because their telemetry showed that almost nobody used it
[18:33:33] <DaveMethvin> but it turned out that the one site that did? Youtube. https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=347922
[18:33:38] <m_gol> haha, this
[18:33:48] <m_gol> yeah, they should measure mobile traffic separately
[18:33:53] <m_gol> otherwise it'll suffer in stats
[18:34:20] <m_gol> but it was funny ;)
[18:34:52] <m_gol> another funny thing I've read on blink-dev recently was when a Google member of its Enterprise Team didn't know they plan to remove showModalDialog :D
[18:35:27] <snover> you can think of large companies more like little corporate city-states
[18:35:44] <snover> they all share the name, but nobody knows what other people are doing in their own house
[18:36:03] <m_gol> and they communicated it clearly via publishing a table summarizing things to remove where sMD was at 27th or sth position in a technical table
[18:36:19] <DaveMethvin> the web is unfortunately full of 0.01% features like that are considered essential by some group
[18:36:41] <DaveMethvin> at least with the youtube case they stuck to their guns afaik and youtube did an update

[18:46:41] <jqcommit> 13jquery/061.x-master 144c68d10 15Dave Methvin: Event: Call underlying stopImmediatePropagation when present...
[18:46:50] <DaveMethvin> at least trac is working now
[18:47:41] <m_gol> it seems even Chrome doesn't go there: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/6a89db86ed817f6a7498076e2a06b90f9fce0831/src/core/ready.js#L78-80
[18:48:58] <DaveMethvin> i love comments like that. "NO, don't even think about it, not gonna work."
[18:49:57] <m_gol> the last readyState I get is interactive
[18:50:02] <m_gol> in this test
[18:50:15] <DaveMethvin> GAAAAH
[18:51:01] <DaveMethvin> if ( "readyState" in document ) just go ahead
[18:54:32] <m_gol> that will catch everything, right? ;)
[18:55:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's just that this stuff is so flakey!
[18:56:06] <snover> the good news is that it doesnâ€™t matter if you just put your scripts where they belong
[18:56:07] <DaveMethvin> readyState should really be "complete" there
[18:56:18] <DaveMethvin> hahahaahahh
[18:56:44] <DaveMethvin> snover you slay me
[18:57:02] <m_gol> ok, it's probably interactive because it's waiting for this php to finish
[18:57:17] <m_gol> still, in Chrome it then goes to the load handler and it works
[18:57:25] <m_gol> for some reason that's not happening in iOS7
[18:57:46] <snover> i was only being partially facetious
[18:57:51] <snover> in the last 3 years iâ€™ve never run into these sorts of issues
[18:57:58] <DaveMethvin> neither do i of course
[18:58:56] <DaveMethvin> it's always some guy who has a wordpress plugin that loads a copy of jquery dynamically because of some conflict with a plugin that the author won't fix because he ran off and joined the circus
[18:59:19] <DaveMethvin> but it's really important because it's  used by the youtube site
[18:59:43] <snover> well at least that author finally found something they were qualified to do
[19:00:15] <DaveMethvin> needed a safer job so he became a lion tamer
[19:01:24] <snover> iâ€™m not saying that i was the one sending the death threats, butâ€¦
[19:01:27] <m_gol> of course maybe it all happens only in iframes, who knows :P
[19:02:20] * m_gol DaveMethvin: I've changed the completed method here:
[19:02:22] <m_gol> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/6a89db86ed817f6a7498076e2a06b90f9fce0831/src/core/ready.js#L85-88
[19:02:30] <m_gol> to alert what event triggered it
[19:02:47] <m_gol> and in Chrome & iOS6 for some reason I see once DOMContentLoaded & then twice load
[19:03:01] <m_gol> on iOS7 the second load is missing
[19:03:10] <m_gol> where do they come from? :/
[19:03:44] <m_gol> ah, maybe some internal code does sth on doc ready
[19:04:01] <m_gol> not support tests, not sure what else
[19:04:52] <DaveMethvin> hmm
[19:06:02] <snover> you guys should come to our free intern webinar!
[19:06:18] <m_gol> the first two are triggered before the QUnit UI fully initializes
[19:06:23] <m_gol> ;)
[19:07:00] <DaveMethvin> OOH
[19:08:14] <m_gol> opening http://jquery.l/test/data/core/dynamic_ready.html directly triggers one load event
[19:08:17] <m_gol> everywhere
[19:08:19] <m_gol> including iOS7
[19:08:26] <m_gol> ergo - iframe-specific bug probably
[19:08:55] <DaveMethvin> iframes causing bugs? NOT POSSIBLE!
[19:09:00] <DaveMethvin> well, maybe a small bug
[19:09:16] <m_gol> so you need an iframe in which you dynamically load jQuery after its DOM loads and then do some code in doc ready of this new jQuery
[19:09:34] <m_gol> I wonder if anyone has ever done sth like that in real life :P
[19:09:42] <DaveMethvin> snover probably
[19:10:15] <m_gol> I don't like the idea of adding any code to cater to that specific issue
[19:10:23] <DaveMethvin> neither do I
[19:10:26] <m_gol> but then we're not able to test it there
[19:10:32] <DaveMethvin> if it was loaded outside doc ready it shoudl work?
[19:10:56] <DaveMethvin> it seems really unlikely someone would load another jquery in the doc ready of the first
[19:11:21] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: yes, just checked
[19:11:21] <DaveMethvin> and if they did, a strange bug that only occurs in iOS7 (and randomly in IE11) would be a really nice reward
[19:11:35] <DaveMethvin> i think you should change the unit test
[19:11:43] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: you forgot about the iframe
[19:12:03] <m_gol> dynamically loading jQuery & then doing sth in doc ready of the new jQuery works in the regular page
[19:12:24] <DaveMethvin> but not the iframe?
[19:12:30] <m_gol> yup
[19:13:08] <m_gol> opening /test/data/core/dynamic_ready.html directly works so it's iframe-specific :)
[19:13:19] <DaveMethvin> imma go work on Angular bugs now
[19:13:32] <snover> DaveMethvin: http://www.sitepen.com/site/intern.html freebies!
[19:13:37] <m_gol> ah, or not
[19:13:51] <m_gol> window.parent.iframeCallback obviously doesn't exist then
[19:13:59] <m_gol> so no wonder behavior is different
[19:14:03] <DaveMethvin> haha
[19:14:17] <DaveMethvin> so snover, who built  your site? that looks pretty pro
[19:14:55] <snover> which part?
[19:15:02] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: but when I changed window.parent.iframeCallback to alert it alerts what it should
[19:15:14] <DaveMethvin> geez 
[19:15:31] <DaveMethvin> just a sec, brb
[19:15:39] <m_gol> don't you love iframes?
[19:15:56] <snover> i think we just hired a giraffe to do it because they kept sticking their necks out for us
[19:16:16] <snover> iframes can do no wrong
[19:16:23] <snover> normally i will make sure my app is running in at least 3 iframes
[19:16:26] <snover> preferably with document.domain set too
[19:18:52] <DaveMethvin> sometimes i feel like we're in iframe-ception
[19:19:47] <m_gol> imagine if we had a bug that manifests itself only if it's not in an iframe :P
[19:19:58] <m_gol> and then write a test for it :P
[19:20:17] <DaveMethvin> that would be easy to fix, we'd just wrap the user's doc in an iframe on document.ready :)
[19:20:25] <m_gol> haha
[19:21:19] <m_gol> Firefox just errored on this very test
[19:21:33] <m_gol> maybe I should bump those timeouts anyway
[19:21:38] <m_gol> for the sake of other browsers
[19:21:43] <DaveMethvin> see once the other browsers hear they can slack off, they all do
[19:21:59] <DaveMethvin> might as well bump the timeouts
[19:22:12] <m_gol> if (!browser) run_the_test()
[19:22:43] <m_gol> that would be funnier before Node.js ;)
[19:23:03] <DaveMethvin> yeah but js in node is like a different world
[19:23:12] <DaveMethvin> a really modern shiny world
[19:23:49] <snover> resist, methvin.
[19:24:40] <DaveMethvin> lie back and think of ie6

[19:28:57] <m_gol> the weekly job moved to the second page ;)
[19:29:23] <DaveMethvin> YAY
[19:29:48] <DaveMethvin> so much pretty
[19:30:08] <DaveMethvin> see and we can still tell the jobs apart by the IE8 gaps
[19:30:12] <DaveMethvin> branches*
[19:30:43] <m_gol> not on weekly once we drop IE6/7
[19:30:53] <m_gol> but that's far future for now ;)
[19:31:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[19:32:06] <m_gol> what are these ajax failures? :( http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2663
[19:32:11] <m_gol> I touched core tests only...
[19:32:58] <DaveMethvin> and a core test in an iframe at that
[19:33:09] <DaveMethvin> got to be random
[19:33:29] <m_gol> this is all so fragile :/
[19:33:40] <DaveMethvin> where's that intern link that snover posted? :)
[19:33:41] <m_gol> I wonder if it's only because of fake timers or not
[19:33:51] <DaveMethvin> we're not using fake timers in ajax
[19:34:05] <DaveMethvin> and the fake timer probs only happen in swarm
[19:34:32] <m_gol> I know we're not explicitely using it but you mean for ajax tests we don't touch any sinon-related code at all?
[19:34:59] <DaveMethvin> none of the sinon code should be activated
[19:35:07] <DaveMethvin> since we run each module separately
[19:35:11] <DaveMethvin> i think the code gets loaded
[19:35:13] <DaveMethvin> but never run
[19:35:24] <m_gol> maybe it's doing sth during load?
[19:35:40] <m_gol> I don't get it why it just disconnects in the middle of the run
[19:36:12] <DaveMethvin> well the ajax tests are setTimeout-happy so they do have that in common with effects
[19:36:50] <m_gol> they shouldn't just all start timeouting now, they do it before they even touch the code I changed
[19:37:15] <DaveMethvin> right, i think this is more likely to be a server problem
[19:37:15] <m_gol> it may be an infra issue, ajax tests could be sensitive for infra hiccups
[19:37:51] <DaveMethvin> well we can move on to karma and see how that screws us
[19:38:02] <m_gol> :)
[19:44:48] <snover> i have everything you need, just look in my trenchcoat 
[19:45:03] <DaveMethvin> i'm not falling for that again
[19:46:00] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin closed pull request #1509: CSS: jQuery#hide should always save display value (06master...0614750) 02http://git.io/m4u2-g

[19:46:42] <DaveMethvin> WHY DO THEY PUT THAT CLOSE BUTTON THERE
[19:46:47] <m_gol> hahaha
[19:47:24] <m_gol> maybe it was LGTMTBC (Looks Good To Me To Be Closed)
[19:47:56] <m_gol> ok, we definitely have some server issues: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2664
[19:48:55] <DaveMethvin> Ugleeeee
[19:49:12] <m_gol> gnarf jzaefferer Krinkle ryanneufeld s5fs: can someone look into it? these failures seem server-related: http://swarm.jquery.org/job/2664
[19:49:43] <DaveMethvin> so m_gol do you ever sleep?
[19:49:46] <Krinkle> m_gol: SEe http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1682099
[19:49:50] <Krinkle> "plain text message" "<html> <head><title>502 Bad Gateway</title></head> <body bgcolor=\"white\"> <center><h1>502 Bad Gateway</h1></center> <hr><center>nginx/1.4.4</center> </body> </html> <!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page --> <!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page --> <!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page --> <!-- a padding to dis

[19:50:13] <m_gol> right, that explains a lot ;)
[19:50:27] <Krinkle> So it's a problem on the server end for the http://builds.jenkins.jquery.com/ end point 
[19:50:32] <Krinkle> maybe it is overloaded?
[19:50:38] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: oops! I meant to go to sleep 2h ago, I just wanted to try this one little test...
[19:50:51] <DaveMethvin> i think the problem is too many iframes
[19:51:44] <m_gol> Krinkle: ok, I'll try to rerun those failed ones tomorrow
[19:52:07] <DaveMethvin> now go to sleep! 
[19:52:30] <m_gol> that was swarmy telling me to go to sleep for sure ;)
[19:52:34] <m_gol> ok then, see ya!
[19:52:40] <DaveMethvin> goodnight!
[20:01:20] <gnarf> m_gol know what request is returning the 502?
[20:01:54] <DaveMethvin> i think he went to sleep gnarf 
[20:02:11] <gnarf> there are 104 php processes running
[20:02:14] <gnarf> on that build box
[20:02:31] <DaveMethvin> see the bottom of http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1682099
[20:02:43] <gnarf> need to figure out which php file in any of jQuery's suites is locking up
[20:03:05] <DaveMethvin> Krinkle: can you help?
[20:04:06] <gnarf> doesn't appear to be on jQuery core ajax at least
[20:04:07] <gnarf> :)
[20:04:15] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: That's a less important error. There isn't a syntax error as much as the response to our php test files is an NGINX web server Gateway timeout, which is an html error page displaying the http error (I pasted it 10 minutes ago) 
[20:04:18] <gnarf> tests are passing after rerun
[20:04:23] <Krinkle> scroll less far down
[20:04:32] <Krinkle> Result: "<html> <head><title>502 Bad Gateway</title></head> <body bgcolor=\"white\"> <center><h1>502 Bad Gateway</h1></center> <hr><center>nginx/1.4.4</center> </body> </html> <!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page --> <!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page --> <!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page --> <!-- a padding to disable MSIE and
[20:04:32] <Krinkle>  Chrome friendly error page --> <!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page --> <!-- a padding to disable MSIE and Chrome friendly error page --> " 
[20:04:39] <gnarf> maybe it is
[20:04:41] <Krinkle> That's the "syntax error"
[20:04:46] <Krinkle> (html isn't javascript)
[20:04:49] <Krinkle> (or json)
[20:05:10] <DaveMethvin> ok so i guess it was some sort of transient error
[20:05:13] <gnarf> Krinkle: no shit - i can read too ;) anyone track down the actual request that is returning the 502 yet?
[20:05:17] <DaveMethvin> if the retest passed
[20:05:19] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i just restarted php-fpm
[20:05:29] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: it had 104 processes
[20:05:34] <gnarf> it was "locked up"
[20:05:40] <Krinkle> gnarf: I was replying to DaveMethvin who was pointing out the syntax error on the bottom of http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1682099
[20:06:08] <gnarf> Krinkle: sorry - /me is moody today, said with lightheartedness as well is distaste ;)  
[20:06:23] <Krinkle> gnarf: It is for any php request from what I can see. No particular one.
[20:06:36] <gnarf> Krinkle: yeah, i guessed as much as well
[20:06:38] <DaveMethvin> i think we're all wishing these problems would go away
[20:06:38] <gnarf> the problem now
[20:06:38] <Krinkle> And indeed it happens only during peak when a bunch of jobs are submitted.
[20:06:53] <gnarf> is that there is SOME php process that isn't "finishing" 
[20:07:03] <gnarf> in one of the builds. files
[20:07:04] <gnarf> lol
[20:07:04] <Krinkle> but it's by no means a large amount of traffic (unless a third party is hitting these urls for fun)
[20:07:08] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[20:07:27] <DaveMethvin> there is a php process with a 30-sec timeout that we use for testing
[20:07:34] <gnarf> i'm figuring something is not "timing out" and filling up the "job queue" on php-fpm
[20:07:35] <DaveMethvin> one per browser
[20:07:35] <Krinkle> it's like a 20 browsers worst case, each test a dozen requests at most. Most of them not in parallel but sequence.
[20:07:48] <Krinkle> Should be trivial for a simple web server running nginx/php
[20:07:58] <gnarf> Krinkle: i agree
[20:08:08] <gnarf> something was lurking if we had 100 concurrent php-fpm processes
[20:08:20] <Krinkle> yeah
[20:08:33] <Krinkle> would be nice if we can trace the access log or error log for those exact requests.
[20:08:35] <Krinkle> are they logged?
[20:08:43] <gnarf> should be
[20:08:48] <Krinkle> referrer or IP would be nice
[20:08:49] <gnarf> i can't really afford time to dig right now
[20:08:58] <gnarf> packing for a flight and all
[20:09:03] <Krinkle> k
[20:09:29] <gnarf> but thats my initial guess of root cause, and we will probably be alright for a few more days before the fpm queue stacks up to full again :)
[20:10:03] <DaveMethvin> ok thanks gnarf, at least it's cleared now
