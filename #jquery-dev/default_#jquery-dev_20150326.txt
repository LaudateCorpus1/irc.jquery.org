[07:36:57] <gabriel_schulhof> Hey! We're running into a crazy situation in mobile: We have https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/integration/navigation/sequence/sequence-path1-path2-dialog-hash-key-tests.html as part of our test suite. When we run that, it redirects to another place by assigning location.href. That file references core from ../../../../external/jquery/jquery.js.
[07:37:17] <gabriel_schulhof> The problem is that, when that file contains version 2.1.3 (or anything 2.x) of core, the redirect fails.
[07:37:25] <gabriel_schulhof> Otherwise, the redirect works.
[07:37:44] <gabriel_schulhof> It even works if I replace the value src attribute with http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.3.js
[07:38:16] <gabriel_schulhof> So, seemingly, it's not so much the version of core that's a problem, but rather where it's being loaded from ... O_o
[07:38:53] <gabriel_schulhof> The failure: https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/55911936#L438
[07:39:05] <gabriel_schulhof> D'you guys have any idea how this might happen?
[07:39:54] <gabriel_schulhof> I've checked the value we assign to location.href, and it's the same in both cases, so it's not like we incorrectly assign location.href in either case.

[11:37:51] <arschmitz> timmywil: Ping!
[11:38:09] <timmywil> hey
[11:38:24] <arschmitz> fyi the attr change broke mobile too
[11:38:57] <arschmitz> timmywil: https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/55491651
[11:38:58] <timmywil> ah, is there an issue somehwere?
[11:39:06] <timmywil> that works
[11:39:18] <timmywil> I'll note that in the agenda
[11:39:33] <arschmitz> thanks
[11:44:06] <gibson042> arschmitz: it looks like that failure is from Promise standards compatibility, not from attr changes
[11:44:30] <gibson042> e.g., https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/unit/transitions/transitions_core.js#L78 looks like it assumes a synchronous `then`
[11:45:02] <gibson042> and https://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/jobs/55491651#L476 says no assertions were run
[11:46:26] <gibson042> oh, but it might actually be both, since there are also "Actual: null", "Expected: undefined" complaints
[11:47:05] <arschmitz> yeah thats the one i was refering to actually gibson042
[11:47:14] <arschmitz> but yoru right it looks like there is a promise one as well
[11:57:36] <gibson042> actually, I don't see any assertions in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/unit/transitions/transitions_core.js with expected: undefined
[11:57:41] <gibson042> it might all be Promise changes

[14:26:16] <JasonHedrick> I'm using qunit to test some ember.js stuff and can't seem to figure out how to test a input field submission that uses 'enter' to submit instead of a button

[14:51:54] <JasonHedrick> that totally makes sense!
[15:27:21] <liambrown> Quick question: the jQuery contributors guide talks about pull requests; so if I want to start helping develop jQuery, should I fork the repo and work on my copy?
[15:27:37] <liambrown> (that's for anybody)
[15:32:00] <agcolom> liambrown: yes, and if you plan on making a pull request, we also recommend that you create a branch first.
[15:32:47] <agcolom> so fork, create a branch, make changes, commit changes in your new branch and send PR. 
[15:32:56] <agcolom> arschmitz: Is this correct?
[15:33:26] <arschmitz> yup
[15:33:41] <agcolom> arschmitz: Thanks :-)
[15:49:34] <liambrown> Got it.
[15:49:48] <liambrown> Separate branch for every PR?
[15:50:46] <arschmitz> liambrown: yes for sure
[15:52:08] <liambrown> And a PR would be something like "I just fixed bug #12345, please pull branch x of fork y" (colloquially)
[15:54:18] <arschmitz> the pr takes care of the branches and stuff
[15:54:57] <arschmitz> liambrown: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1520 
[15:55:00] <arschmitz> is a good example
[15:56:51] <arschmitz> or actually https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/1479/files is a better one shows dicsussion and its not from a curren team member
[15:57:50] <liambrown> Those are both helpful, thanks.
[15:58:08] <liambrown> Kind of you to put up with a neophyte. :)
[15:59:41] <arschmitz> liambrown: we were all new at some point
