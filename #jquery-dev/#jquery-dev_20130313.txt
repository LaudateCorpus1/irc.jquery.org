[07:10:39] <ben_alman> hey DaveMethvin what do you guys use for generating a changelog?
[07:10:45] <ben_alman> is it super-duper verbose?
[07:10:52] <ben_alman> git log or somesuch?
[07:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/build/release/release.js#L214
[07:33:24] <DaveMethvin> ben_alman i use a little node script that pulls from our trac setup 
[07:33:53] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately that falls prey to the garbage-in, garbage-out principle quite often
[07:34:42] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/build/release-notes.js
[07:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You're silly.
[07:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> You're parsing the HTML output?
[07:45:19] <DaveMethvin> is there a JSON or XML feed?
[07:45:30] <timmywil> scott_gonzalez, DaveMethvin: how's that? https://github.com/timmywil/jquery/commit/9c3aef67d4ea595cc66540825199ff7ea83387bd
[07:45:30] <b-ot> timmywil: MichaÅ‚ GoÅ‚Ä™biowski (1m 25s ago): Authors update for MichaÅ‚ GoÅ‚Ä™biowski. Closes gh-1201.
[07:45:38] <scott_gonzalez> You can use format=tab in the query string to get tab-delimited output.
[07:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> Much saner to parse
[07:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> You can also specify which columns you want instead of getting the default columsn
[07:46:21] <scott_gonzalez> col=id&col=component&col=...
[07:46:29] <DaveMethvin> well john went thru the trouble of parsing it and since it works i just stuck with it
[07:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> heh, ok, so John is silly :-P
[07:46:46] <DaveMethvin> timmywil that looks good to me
[07:47:01] <DaveMethvin> trac has a lot of options i've never explored
[07:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: That looks good. You shouldn't need to specify the name the second time.
[07:47:58] <DaveMethvin> i stilll haven't figured out how to edit the full headers/footers/templates without getting on the server
[07:48:04] <DaveMethvin> he just wanted a different email
[07:48:10] <DaveMethvin> and no middle initial
[07:48:12] <scott_gonzalez> `grunt authors` should respect he mailmap and output the correct name/email now.
[07:48:24] <timmywil> it will match either way
[07:48:47] <timmywil> but yea, I can remove the name
[07:49:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'll match either way. I was just letting you know the second name isn't important in case you weren't aware.
[07:49:44] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: What happened to the rest of the map?
[07:49:53] <DaveMethvin> never created one
[07:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> I can put it on my list if you want.
[07:50:11] <DaveMethvin> is there a simple way to just generate it?
[07:50:12] <scott_gonzalez> I finally took the time today to finish the UI one.
[07:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> I just did it manually.
[07:51:05] <DaveMethvin> i'm looking at the hand.js code right now, decided to just add comments and dump it in a gist
[07:51:05] <ben_alman> thx DaveMethvin i just used git log
[07:51:16] <scott_gonzalez> Especially with people changing their email address or how their full name is displayed after signing the CLA.
[07:51:17] <ben_alman> also, this ftw https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1
[07:51:54] <DaveMethvin> yeah we need to update off 0.4.0rc5 and prepare for node 0.10
[07:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> ben_alman: This is why UI has a commit message style guide...
[07:53:24] <ben_alman> yeah, i manage all the PRs and do the final merges
[07:53:26] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: http://shane.io/2011/10/07/git-shortlog-and-mailmap.html might help
[07:53:34] <ben_alman> DaveMethvin: wow 0.4.0rc5
[07:53:36] <ben_alman> so old
[07:54:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm sure there were major architectural changes in rc6 that we are missing :D
[07:54:53] <ben_alman> well, all the docs are for 0.4.0+
[07:54:58] <ben_alman> and not any rc
[07:55:04] <ben_alman> there were a lot of changes in the rcs
[07:55:10] <ben_alman> yet they were all still rcs
[07:55:12] <ben_alman> heh
[07:55:35] <DaveMethvin> a lot of the jquery repos are still on 0.3 it seems
[07:55:52] <scott_gonzalez> A lot of them will remain on 0.3 for a while.
[07:56:00] <DaveMethvin> had some probs with api.jquery.com last night on windows and wondered if it would be fixed by 0.4
[07:57:15] <DaveMethvin> ugh hand.js ... so ... much ... duplication

[08:00:42] <timmywil> DaveMethvin: I got a local api.jquery.com working last night btw
[08:00:57] <DaveMethvin> now it's my turn!
[08:01:14] <timmywil> I know you have the harder job with windows ;)
[08:01:41] <timmywil> but I might be able to help if you hit a snag
[08:02:40] <DaveMethvin> gotta figure out the path issue, not sure why it can't find npm when launched via grunt.util.spawn
[08:02:49] <DaveMethvin> that's why i mentioned the 0.4 upgrade
[08:03:51] <timmywil> but you can run npm from the command line?
[08:03:57] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[08:04:10] <DaveMethvin> and it's in both paths (windows and bash)
[08:05:02] <DaveMethvin> i think the spawn may be using some minimal path rather than the "real" one that I get when i start a windows command shell
[08:05:13] <DaveMethvin> but i just need to dig into it ... later
[08:05:53] <timmywil> I suspect it would have to do with whatever path Node is using, not just grunt.util.spawn
[08:05:59] <timmywil> that's prolly what you meant

[10:12:49] <DaveMethvin> mkwst here's one for the pile: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=189184
[10:13:01] <DaveMethvin> seems like a clone shouldn't trigger that error
[10:40:39] <mkwst> DaveMethvin: Right. There's been some discussion about whether CSSOM counts as inline style; it doesn't in WebKit, Mozilla's on the fence. Regardless, either the initial .style should fail or the clone should fail. 
[10:41:41] <DaveMethvin> mkwst several of our feature detects depend on being able to set styles via CSSOM so if Webkit was "fixed" we'd be sad :)
[10:42:59] <mkwst> Noted. :)
