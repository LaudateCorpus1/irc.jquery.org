[06:19:19] <schalkneethling> Hey everyone, I was wondering. Seeing that the 2.x branch of jQuery supports only IE9+ why is the bind function still simulated? i.e. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/10399ddcf8a239acc27bdec9231b996b178224d3/src/core.js#L443
[06:20:57] <schalkneethling> can it not just be fn.bind( context || this, args.concat( slice.call( arguments ) ) ); in place of lines 443 - 447
[06:21:53] <schalkneethling> And I guess the bigger question is, why have proxy in there at all
