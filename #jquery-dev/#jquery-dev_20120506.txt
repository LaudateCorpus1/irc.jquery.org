[07:24:48] <jaubourg> DaveMethvin: I need your halp
[07:24:51] <jaubourg> help even
[07:25:05] <DaveMethvin> sup jaubourg
[07:25:10] <jaubourg> can't find a good idea for a talk proposal for jqcon.... :/
[07:25:16] <DaveMethvin> oh noes
[07:25:18] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
[07:25:23] <jaubourg> ><
[07:25:30] <DaveMethvin> anything we're doing for 1.8 that might be interesting?
[07:26:22] <jaubourg> well, I didn't participate to the cool stuff this time so I should let others, who were involved, talk about it
[07:26:28] <DaveMethvin> even a drill-down into callbacks or deferreds might be interesting ... the talks are only like 30 minutes this year so it's hard to go deep on a lot of stuff
[07:26:29] <jaubourg> namely gnarf
[07:26:51] <jaubourg> you think people would be interested in deferreds again?
[07:27:04] <DaveMethvin> if it was some real-life solutions or something
[07:27:44] <DaveMethvin> let me think about some topics, will you be around later today?
[07:27:48] <jaubourg> because I have the talk I gave to wakanday last year which was a remix of dan's + some patterns from the script junkie article we did with addy: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29w0fFKAEtw
[07:27:56] <jaubourg> should be around, yes
[09:01:51] <David_Souther> Deferreds and callbacks would be awesome. At my company, I've been evangelizing, but there's still something not clicking. I put together http://jsfiddle.net/southerd/ZWxzA/ which has helped some.
[09:02:22] <David_Souther> http://davidsouther.github.com/jQuery-Best-Parts-presentation/#/deferred
[09:02:43] <David_Souther> (there's a popup with speaker notes on that slide)
[09:31:14] <jaubourg> David_Souther: what is the lib you use to make your talk?
[09:31:19] <jaubourg> (or rather slides)
[09:31:32] <johnkpaul> impress.js
[09:32:04] <johnkpaul> it's a really nice library, but takes a lot of effort compared to reveal
[09:32:41] <jaubourg> thanks for the info johnkpaul
[09:32:53] <johnkpaul> no problem
[10:14:12] <David_Souther> @johnkpaul, @jaubourg I haven't used Reveal; I didn't find it that difficult to get impress.js to do what I wanted. I spent the vast amount of my time writing content, and an hour writing the speaker notes plugin.
[10:15:43] <David_Souther> jaubourg: is http://www.zurb.com/playground/reveal-modal-plugin the reveal  you're talking about?
[10:15:52] <David_Souther> I don't see how that does presentations...
[10:33:46] <jaubourg> David_Souther: I think johnkpaul talked about http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/
[10:34:10] <johnkpaul> yes, that's the one I meant

[11:10:52] <jqcommit> [testswarm/master] update HISTORY for cc90771fa7e14afd793ad218a66787fcb671b793 - Timo Tijhof
[12:44:16] <David_Souther> Reveal-js is a nice tradeoff. It's still very slide-y, but those slides look very good. You can't do the crazy things Impress allows, but you don't have to program your pixels either :)
[12:44:58] <ajpiano> impress is so much fun though
[12:45:15] <ajpiano> i used it once just to make a slideshow of sponsors for an event at a club, lol
[12:45:15] <David_Souther> I think I'll personally stick with impress :)
[12:45:30] <David_Souther> Slides have just become so blase...

[14:32:08] <DaveMethvin> and yeah i owe you some feedback about conf topics
[14:33:47] <jaubourg> it's all right, Sarkozy is out and it made my day, I'm so happy I don't mind anything today :P

[19:23:32] <Krinkle> DaveMethvin: Hm.. did you mean to add "&& context.nodeType " in  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/95a4a776cffe6dd56f5796e93c0cba0225ee49e4 ?
[19:23:33] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery by dmethvin (58m, 37s ago): Simplify jQuery( html, props ), closes gh-765.
[19:24:55] <DaveMethvin> well, i convinced myself it was right ... for what good that is
[19:25:06] <Krinkle> odd, github says scott_gonzalez closed the issue
[19:25:10] <Krinkle> you did
[19:25:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah i wondered about that
[19:25:28] <DaveMethvin> the commit right after that was right
[19:25:42] <Krinkle> yeah
[19:25:46] <DaveMethvin> i figured it was a github strangeness, the git log is correct
[19:26:36] <DaveMethvin> so basically that is trying to make doc the same as document for the case where it's a plain object
[19:27:07] <DaveMethvin> it was supposed to save a byte but it read better to me in any case
[19:27:45] <Krinkle> so what does the && context.nodeType do in this case? doesn't seem related? I get the if/else squash, nice one :)
[19:27:58] <Krinkle> but the && context.nodeType may not be intentional, on the other hand, it does make sense nowo that i read it in context
[19:28:03] <Krinkle> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/jquery/blob/57bdbd5adf05b0773cdf1e0997cf589e0befde22/src/core.js#L108
[19:29:14] <DaveMethvin> i think it was intentional, we only want to try for a ownerDocument if it's a dom node
[19:29:21] <Krinkle> yeah
[19:29:39] <DaveMethvin> if it's a plain object we want to end up with document
[19:29:47] <Krinkle> so it should have a unit test>?
[19:30:05] <Krinkle> for context being passed { ownerDocument: 'blabla' }
[19:30:16] <Krinkle> meh that looks very bad :
[19:30:26] <DaveMethvin> path-o-logical! :D
[19:30:40] <Krinkle> but then again, if it was worth fixing
[19:30:50] <DaveMethvin> it would be { nodeType: 1 }
[19:30:54] <DaveMethvin> that would be sick
[19:31:00] <Krinkle> ah
[19:31:07] <Krinkle> nah, that'll be fine
[19:31:15] <Krinkle> `context.ownerDocument || context `
[19:31:19] <Krinkle> or not
[19:31:24] <Krinkle> it falls back to context, not to document
[19:31:27] <Krinkle> right
[19:31:35] <Krinkle> in case it is a document itself
[19:31:54] <Krinkle> { nodeType: 1 } would be a killer, but if would've been a killer before this commit as well
[19:32:08] <DaveMethvin> all of jQuery dies on that one
[19:32:14] <Krinkle> yeah
[19:33:00] <Krinkle> if it weren't for IE, a simple instanceof would be a good check instead of .nodeType
[19:33:02] <Krinkle> pretty solid
[19:33:08] <Krinkle> but IE doesn't let us
[19:33:15] <Krinkle> since it isn't a public constructor there
[19:33:17] <Krinkle> right ?
[19:33:23] <DaveMethvin> yeah, when we can drop ie 6/7/8 this code will get a lot easier
[19:33:32] <Krinkle> IE8 as well?
[19:33:42] <DaveMethvin> i think there are still some quirks in ie6
[19:33:47] <DaveMethvin> um, ie8
[19:34:06] <Krinkle> right :P
[19:34:14] <DaveMethvin> certainly a lot of the event problems are there
[19:37:36] * Krinkle added a code comment to the pr. scott_gonzalez knows what he's doing :)
[19:39:15] <DaveMethvin> never hurts to ask Krinkle :)
[20:48:17] <Krinkle> ai... appendto.com uses jquery 1.2.6 on their site?
