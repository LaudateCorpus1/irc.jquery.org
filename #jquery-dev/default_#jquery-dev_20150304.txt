[06:01:33] <gsoc-participant> hello..I am interested in jquery-mobile project which focuses on switching the library..
[06:04:13] <gsoc-participant> I am very interested and I have knowledge of javascript dom and oop. I think i am capable of doing that task. It would be great if you can guide me through..
[06:18:26] <arthurvr> gsoc-participant: Hi there! Let‚Äôs move over to #jqueryui-dev. The mobile team is hanging out over there :)
[06:18:44] <gsoc-participant> yeah sure
[07:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> leobalter: Regarding https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/751#issuecomment-77175893, the foundation has no requirements at all regarding commit messages.
[07:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> Individual projects have commit guidelines.
[07:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> We happen to have many projects that follow the same guidelines.
[07:28:59] <leobalter> not the commit messages, but the author information on each commit that I was referring to
[07:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> "they require some strict rules on commit messages that might be not friendly sometimes."
[07:31:35] <leobalter> it was my way to say changing author info on commits is a PITA
[07:33:10] <scott_gonzalez> If you have problems with processes, please speak to the team about it, don't rant in PRs.

[07:37:55] <doesallmagic2> leonardo.balter: Dump: Fix .name/.property doublettes
[07:39:40] <leobalter> scott_gonzalez: is it possible to allow the CLA check page to verify commits sha that are not part of a PR?
[07:39:53] <scott_gonzalez> Why would we do that?
[07:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> And how would that even happen?
[07:40:17] <leobalter> I fixed the #751 commit and I would like to double check it without creating another PR
[07:40:53] <scott_gonzalez> That definitely wouldn't happen via the results page for an existing PR.
[07:41:12] <leobalter> I just wanted to make sure the author info was valid after I fixed
[07:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to propose an API for jquery-license via an issue.
[07:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure what it would look like.
[07:42:29] <scott_gonzalez> Would you want to run it as a binary from within the repo dir?
[07:42:57] <scott_gonzalez> like: qunit $ jquery-license-audit commit SHA
[07:43:23] <scott_gonzalez> s/audit commit/audit-commit/
[07:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> SHA would probably be a committish.
[07:44:25] <leobalter> that works for me

[08:03:35] <leobalter> :/
[08:04:44] <Krinkle> leobalter: Thats not travis
[08:05:00] <Krinkle> The "dump: dump, TypeError properties (" unit test and two others are failing in 80% of browsers

[08:05:45] <leobalter> not travis, that's browserstack, all the tests pass if I run it locally

[08:07:16] <Krinkle> leobalter: That failure follows https://github.com/jquery/qunit/commit/ce8c795619cf5a01
[08:07:19] <Krinkle> Not notOK
[08:07:30] <Krinkle> and looking at test swarm it looks pretty real to me
[08:07:40] <jzaefferer> leobalter: tests fail locally for me as well
[08:07:50] <Krinkle> Perhaps just an outdated test, but it won't be fixed by travis or browserstack.
[08:13:29] <leobalter> that log was from master branch
[08:14:37] <leobalter> ok, it's failing now
[08:14:43] <leobalter> I'll fix it asap
[08:16:32] <leobalter> should I revert the doubletes commit?
[08:16:40] <leobalter> in the meanwhile?
[08:17:02] <leobalter> I'll see if I can fix it in the next 15 minutes, otherwise I'll revert it
