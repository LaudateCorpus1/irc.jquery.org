[10:28:00] <saptaks> Hello everyone
[10:28:37] <saptaks> I have previously worked in jquery sizzle project for setting up no conflict function
[10:28:50] <saptaks> But then got busy with some college work and GSoC.
[10:29:05] <saptaks> I would like to start contributing again to jQuery
[10:29:16] <saptaks> So can someone suggest some issues which I may work on?
