[06:33:11] <DaveMethvin> m_gol: I think the bower error is b/c we don't save the built file on every commit ... nor should we
[06:33:12] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[06:33:15] <DaveMethvin> `read
[06:33:17] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: From m_gol, 2h 33m ago: Angular now skips jQuery's class manip. methods so that they work on SVG nodes. I know SVG is technically out of our scope but I'm hearing about class manip. problems about 100x more than about anything other in jQuery not working on SVG.
[06:33:40] <m_gol> yep, that's why people should be installing a package
[06:33:56] <DaveMethvin> it seems strange that Bower doesn't give some error
[06:34:11] <DaveMethvin> at least not a decent one :)
[06:34:18] <m_gol> this detached tag thing is a PITA
[06:34:55] <DaveMethvin> but should bower.json even be there if the repo doesn't support Bower? Maybe it shoudl just be a build artifact now
[06:36:04] <DaveMethvin> i just don't subscribe to the idea that our development repo must at any instant have the ability to distribute a built file
[06:36:12] <DaveMethvin> and that seems to be what bower wants
[06:36:13] <m_gol> agreed
[06:36:24] <m_gol> we could generate bower.json during the release process
[06:36:35] <m_gol> but that would affect everyone and would have to be built-in into jquery-release
[06:36:39] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[06:36:56] <m_gol> I just want npm to get easier deduping and forget about bower :D
[06:37:08] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[06:37:28] <DaveMethvin> i'll open a ticket about this
[06:41:06] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15dmethvin opened issue #1673: Create bower.json during release, remove from repo 02http://git.io/az6sSQ
[06:41:19] <rwaldron> m_gol interesting, but adding support for svg into jQuery would be a lot of: work, new code and new bugs
[06:41:46] <DaveMethvin> so m_gol if people know they're using SVG why don't they use the classList.add/remove directly?
[06:41:53] <rwaldron> (ie. "official" support)
[06:42:15] <m_gol> rwaldron: I'm not talking about full SVG support; I understand both stances here, though. It's not easy to choose right
[06:42:43] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: because it's a generic code reused on HTML & SVG
[06:42:53] <m_gol> so it'd require branching
[06:42:56] <DaveMethvin> you mean their own code is generic?
[06:42:59] <rwaldron> m_gol maybe i misunderstood
[06:43:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah but of course *our* code would require branching :)
[06:43:23] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: Nothing needs to be built into jquery-release. Every project has it's own release script that builds on top of it.
[06:43:23] <rwaldron> ^^ that's what I meant
[06:43:31] <rwaldron> oops, DaveMethvin  not scott_gonzalez 
[06:43:47] <m_gol> that's true
[06:43:55] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: i think m_gol  meant our script that runs as part of the release
[06:43:56] <m_gol> damn IE9 ;)
[06:44:01] <DaveMethvin> at least i understood it that way
[06:44:09] <m_gol> yeah, sorry, I mixed things up
[06:44:21] <scott_gonzalez> I must've misunderstood what you meant by "affect everyone"
[06:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> I thought you meant affect all of our projects.
[06:45:06] <m_gol> I meant that, I though the logic is in a different place; not much of a problem then
[06:45:07] <DaveMethvin> well the main thing for me is that we shouldn't leave bower.json around unless we plan to support bower in the repo at rest http://git.io/az6sSQ
[06:45:16] <DaveMethvin> and we don't
[06:45:49] <jqcommit> [13jquery] 15mzgol labeled issue #1673: Create bower.json during release, remove from repo 02http://git.io/az6sSQ
[06:46:58] <DaveMethvin> so m_gol when you said "it's generic code" did you mean the code the user is writing that calls our .addClass method?
[06:47:12] <m_gol> yes
[06:47:20] <DaveMethvin> or is this inside Angular itself?
[06:48:05] <m_gol> https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/b1ee5386d584f208bce6d3b613afdb3bae9df76a/src/ng/animate.js#L189-L196
[06:48:17] <m_gol> I meant Angular by "the user" here
[06:48:39] <m_gol> so that's not a big problem now, they just use their own jqLite addClass etc.
[06:48:43] <DaveMethvin> ah ok
[06:49:15] <m_gol> it just shows enough people care about SVG class handling here so that they switched to their own impl.
[06:50:09] <m_gol> they're using setAttribute, though: https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/b1ee5386d584f208bce6d3b613afdb3bae9df76a/src/jqLite.js#L384
[06:50:22] <DaveMethvin> I'd really prefer to avoid two very differnet paths through addClass, which is what we'd have if we feature-detected 
[06:50:23] <m_gol> it seems this might be affecting performance?
[06:50:53] <m_gol> they have one code path here bc of using setAttribute
[06:50:59] <DaveMethvin> it probably IS slower, but perhaps not a true perf issue since the next thing to happen in the browser is recalc styles and potentially a layout
[06:51:38] <DaveMethvin> setAttribute is almost certainly slower than assigning to .className property
[06:51:52] <DaveMethvin> but again may only show up in jsperfs and not real life
[06:51:54] <m_gol> who thought a completely differetnt SVG className "type" is a good idea? :)
[06:51:59] <DaveMethvin> exactly
[06:52:29] <DaveMethvin> svg is like a bizarro world of dom
[06:53:19] <DaveMethvin> tbh i'm more concerned that angular can't generally use 2.0 ... that's still a thing, right?
[07:05:38] <m_gol> nope
[07:05:42] <m_gol> DaveMethvin:
[07:06:09] <m_gol> Angular 1.2 is officially compatible with jQuery >=1.7.0 <2.0.0, 1.3 with >=2.1.1 (though it should work with all >=1.7.0)
[07:06:17] <m_gol> Angular 1.3 is not out yet
[07:06:47] <m_gol> it's on rc.3
[07:07:22] <m_gol> I drastically reduced all the craziness Angular used to do around jQuery :D
