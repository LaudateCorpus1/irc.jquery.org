[08:34:50] <scott_gonzalez> Can someone familiar with the event system confirm if my understanding of the new code is correct?
[08:35:09] <scott_gonzalez> We no longer create lists of properties to copy per event type.
[08:35:39] <scott_gonzalez> We now have a single list that is maintained via getters and setters on the prototype.
[08:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> So every event will have all properties defined, but we expect users to only access the relevant ones based on the event type.

[11:52:59] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez: that's correct. AFAIK the original split was done for performance reasons to limit the number of copied props, this is no longer needed. If the fields are not there for a specific type, they'll return undefined anyway
[11:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for confirming, m_gol.

[16:07:00] <timmywil> DaveMethvin|away: ping
[16:07:15] <timmywil> or gibson042 
[16:07:22] <gibson042> I'm half here
[16:08:13] <timmywil> you know more about this than me. was trying to understand that e.which code. I forced the fallback and this seems wrong: http://jsbin.com/hureba/edit?html,js,console,output
[16:11:20] <timmywil> maybe e.button is different in browsers that don't support which
[16:12:30] <timmywil> coincidentally, I'm not sure we need this fallback
[16:14:10] <timmywil> ah yea, http://www.quirksmode.org/js/events_properties.html#button
[16:14:20] <timmywil> makes sense now
[16:14:26] <timmywil> I think we can remove this!
[16:58:01] * gibson042 cheers
