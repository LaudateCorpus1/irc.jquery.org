[15:03:20] <Krinkle|detached> ben_alman: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt/blob/devel/docs/api_task.md link "watch task source" is outdated.
[15:56:36] <Krinkle> Any grunteers here?
[15:56:55] <Krinkle> I'm using grunt-contrib-qunit but keep running into an odd undefined error
[15:57:03] <Krinkle> Running "qunit:all" (qunit) task
[15:57:03] <Krinkle> Verifying property qunit.all exists in config...OK
[15:57:03] <Krinkle> Warning: Cannot read property 'srcRaw' of undefined Use --force to continue.
[15:57:16] <Krinkle> Ah, there is a channel
[15:57:19] * Krinkle joins #grunt
[18:33:32] <Krinkle> ajpiano: And green will be for jquery.org ?
[18:33:41] <Krinkle> (which is purple now)
[18:33:44] <Krinkle> (in the stage)
[23:35:31] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: you around?
[23:35:39] <gnarf> whats up?
[23:35:48] <ryanneufeld> jquery color
[23:35:59] <ryanneufeld> will it lemme get RGB values of the current color?
[23:36:09] <ryanneufeld> like can I get the color of the text in an RGB format?
[23:36:16] <gnarf> yes
[23:36:22] <ryanneufeld> do I need it for that?
[23:36:43] <gnarf> it will make it easier
[23:36:54] <gnarf> some browsers return rgba() some #123123 some strings
[23:37:06] <ryanneufeld> and color will standardize it?
[23:37:27] <gnarf> yeah, what do you need from it?
[23:38:09] <gnarf> rgba() // returns a rgba "tuple" [ red, green, blue, alpha ]
[23:38:16] <ryanneufeld> perfect
[23:38:22] <gnarf> $.Color( element, "color" ).rgba()
[23:38:23] <ryanneufeld> that is exactly what I need :)
[23:39:53] <ryanneufeld> most excellent!
[23:46:09] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: https://github.com/ryanneufeld/zsh-theme-builder
[23:46:48] <ryanneufeld> Basically, I want to do for zsh themes (maybe even bash later) what ui/mobile did with theme roller
[23:46:56] <ryanneufeld> on that note, I'm off to bed
