[06:22:58] <DaveMethvin> okay, well this explains the error i'm seeing locally http://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/chrome/5b3ePr9rMVQ
[06:23:12] <DaveMethvin> still not sure why those etag errors are happening
[06:23:41] <DaveMethvin> but they're not happening for me locally
[06:23:55] <DaveMethvin> and i don't see how the sinon changes in effects could break it

[07:04:03] <DaveMethvin> hokay, well clearly something has become borked on the server b/c we didn't change anything related to those etag tests
[07:15:00] <m_gol> DaveMethvin: but does reverting the SinonJS patch help at all here?

[07:15:24] <DaveMethvin> so i don't think it's related
[07:15:29] <m_gol> hmm, ok
[07:15:38] <m_gol> weird coincidence then :D
[07:15:58] <DaveMethvin> yes, even though i don't believe in coincidinces ... or santa claus
[07:16:30] <DaveMethvin> i thought maybe the sinon stuff was bleeding over somehow but it's neatly encapsulated in the setup/teardown
[07:16:47] <DaveMethvin> and the unit tests in swarm only run 1 test module so it wouldn't affect there

[07:23:43] <DaveMethvin> btw i posted about the problem in #jquery-infrastructure, hopefully gnarf s5fs or someone will let us know
[07:27:05] <m_gol> I see there's a new jquery-release repo; are there any specific groups created for such things?
[07:27:24] <m_gol> bc I don't have an access even too see that repo ;)
[07:27:45] <DaveMethvin> not sure m_gol ... scott_gonzalez when new repos are created do we have some standard set of people/groups added?
[07:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> m_gol: I was just waiting for DaveMethvin to say that he's good with the new process, then I was going to make it public.
[07:28:22] <DaveMethvin> oh, it's good, sorry thought i mentioned that
[07:28:29] <scott_gonzalez> The appropriate groups are already added to the repo. It just needs to be made public.
[07:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, making it public now.
[07:29:05] <scott_gonzalez> done
[07:29:06] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-release/
[07:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> The release team is the only team that has push access (in addition to owners).
[07:29:52] <scott_gonzalez> The release team is currently arschmitz, gseguin, timmywil.
[07:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> Everyone else that works with releases is an owner.
[07:30:28] <scott_gonzalez> As far as I know. If anyone is missing, just let me know.
[07:30:36] <timmywil> DaveMethvin, scott_gonzalez: I'd be willing to try to integrate that script for the final release
[07:30:52] <DaveMethvin> that would be great timmywil!
[07:31:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that'd be great. Can you do it in a branch so we can compare the results?
[07:31:06] <timmywil> it looks like we may have a beta3, which would give us a buffer
[07:31:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah, beta3 for sure
[07:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> It'd give us a push to flesh out some of the missing bits too.
[07:32:12] <timmywil> Cool. Nice work, Scott. I'm excited about this.
[07:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> Me too. It'll be nice to finally have some shared code and get a really stable release process across all projects.
[07:33:08] <scott_gonzalez> I have plans to make releases as simple as possible.
[07:33:28] <scott_gonzalez> This is the first step.

[10:48:16] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ^
[10:48:30] <DaveMethvin> kk gnarf
[10:49:07] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: so when you gzip something, you should remove a strong etag
[10:49:22] <gnarf> so maybe nginx wasn't previously doing this w
[10:49:35] <gnarf> it should leave weak etag's alone
[10:49:38] <gnarf> but it doesn't currently
[10:49:43] <gnarf> so either way we need that
[10:57:34] <gnarf> DaveMethvin- though now i need to fix the ifNoneMatch
[11:00:14] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: got it working
[11:05:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: that should cherry-pick to 1.x safely too
[11:06:19] <DaveMethvin> i'll try master first and see how it goes

[11:16:19] <m_gol> less failures now
[11:16:33] <DaveMethvin> yeah, applying to 1.x-master
[11:16:53] <DaveMethvin> and then we can figure out the fails ... which of course don't happen locally :(

[11:18:41] <m_gol> does it mean that the browser hung?
[11:19:31] <DaveMethvin> i think it may, and then it finished later?
[11:19:53] <DaveMethvin> seems kind of random, let's see what 1.x says
[11:22:19] <DaveMethvin> unit tests are such drama queens
[11:22:36] <DaveMethvin> one day they're fine, then suddenly "oh noes my etags feel bad"
[11:23:04] <DaveMethvin> wait until we upgrade to chrome 30/31 and start to see that sync ajax fail due to their bug
[11:24:50] <DaveMethvin> okay well it seems the remaining fails are sinon-related since 1.x is happier
[11:25:08] <DaveMethvin> http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery notbad.gif
[11:26:18] <DaveMethvin> really strange, the chrome/ff ones really did complete but show as aborted
[11:26:24] <DaveMethvin> and this one dies in the middle http://swarm.jquery.org/result/1217491
[11:29:56] <m_gol> haha, IE6 finished faster than IE7
[11:34:04] <m_gol> A LOT faster

[11:34:06] <doesallmagic2> Dave Methvin: Ajax: Use weak ETag header in tests
[11:34:52] <DaveMethvin> <doesallmagic2> BIG FAT LIAR
[11:35:15] <m_gol> IE7 still going!
[11:35:28] <DaveMethvin> take it up with ie7, swarmy
[11:36:37] <m_gol> I thought browsers are killed on timeout?
[11:36:51] <m_gol> the failure was reported and http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery still shows IE7 in progress
[11:37:10] <DaveMethvin> let me try to reset it
[11:38:53] <DaveMethvin> well i reset failed runs but it seems to have not restarted
[11:39:14] <DaveMethvin> we'll just say it's okay, our issue with sinon in master is the real problem
[11:40:21] <DaveMethvin> not really sure how those two showed they were aborted by an error...oh unless they failed in teardown perhaps, after success was determined by qunit?
[11:40:38] <DaveMethvin> which of course isn't happening locally
[11:40:54] <DaveMethvin> so maybe the injected swarm code is getting confused by the fake timers
[11:41:25] <DaveMethvin> maybe the sinon stuff should be inline, before the first test and after the last
[11:42:01] <DaveMethvin> i'll try that later, gotta run
[11:42:18] <DaveMethvin> but yay the reset worked on 1.x
[11:42:30] <m_gol> ;)
[13:23:55] <DaveMethvin> oh the reset worked on master too, just took longer http://swarm.jquery.org/project/jquery
[13:24:16] <DaveMethvin> so now i wonder if I should just wait until the next commit to see what happens
[13:24:24] <DaveMethvin> do something? or do nothing? hmmm
[13:28:43] <m_gol> haha
[13:28:54] <m_gol> re-trigger the build 10 times & check what happens? :)
[13:29:13] <DaveMethvin> of course not! 
[13:29:20] <DaveMethvin> i'll write a script to do that
[13:29:24] <m_gol> ;)
[13:29:35] <m_gol> and doesallmagic2 didn't notify about the build success
[13:29:37] <m_gol> only failures
[13:29:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah, it's basically a Bad News Bot
[13:30:51] <DaveMethvin> watch your back doesallmagic2 ... there's always doesallmagic3 you know
[14:59:21] <seancurtis> anyone know what is happening with bugs.jquery.com ?
[15:00:22] <DaveMethvin> ugh ... seancurtis i will ping our folks in #jquery-infrastructure, if you see that later you can do it too
[15:07:34] <seancurtis> it's been down for over 12 hours now :/
[15:41:11] <DaveMethvin> seancurtis the bug you're mentioning only applies to oldIE anyway
[15:41:23] <DaveMethvin> and it's hard to fix without ugly code
[15:41:27] <seancurtis> IE8 and lower?
[15:41:31] <DaveMethvin> yeah oldie
[15:41:49] <gnarf> whats the bug?
[15:42:09] <seancurtis> why won't parseInt(0 + "medium", 10); work?
[15:42:13] <DaveMethvin> css of the border returning "medium" rather than "NNpx"
[15:42:36] <DaveMethvin> NaN
[15:42:37] <gnarf> sigh -- getComputed?
[15:42:42] <DaveMethvin> gnarf right
[15:42:48] <gnarf> fail
[15:42:51] <DaveMethvin> which oldIE doesn't ahve
[15:42:53] <seancurtis> DaveMethvin: works in the console...
[15:42:55] <gnarf> what is "medium" anyway ?
[15:42:57] <seancurtis> what am I missing?
[15:43:05] <seancurtis> gnarf medium width
[15:43:13] <gnarf> yeah, 2px?
[15:43:14] <gnarf> 3px?
[15:43:21] <seancurtis> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-width
[15:43:22] <ryanneufeld> seancurtis: cause medium isn't a number
[15:43:33] <DaveMethvin> WAT?
[15:43:33] <b-ot> DaveMethvin: The new icon changes your desktop look really professional!
[15:43:38] <DaveMethvin> why was i not notified?
[15:43:38] <seancurtis> ryanseddon: hence the 0 +
[15:43:41] <ryanneufeld> and you're trying to parse an int from a word, that is not a number
[15:43:58] <ryanneufeld> seancurtis: that only means you're asking the browser to parse 0medium
[15:44:01] <ryanneufeld> as an integer
[15:44:12] <DaveMethvin> let me check
[15:44:21] <ryanneufeld> parseInt("0medium", 10);
[15:44:30] <ryanneufeld> js> parseInt("0medium", 10);
[15:44:34] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: No output.
[15:44:43] <DaveMethvin> my underwear says "Medium" is -2
[15:44:47] <DaveMethvin> 34-36
[15:44:49] <gnarf> so wtf retuning "medium"
[15:44:59] <ryanneufeld> js> print parseInt("0medium", 10);
[15:45:04] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: No output.
[15:45:20] <DaveMethvin> the right cross browser way to do that is to set the border to a px value
[15:45:20] <gnarf> js> print("boo")
[15:45:25] <b-ot> gnarf: boo 
[15:45:27] <DaveMethvin> unfortunately
[15:45:28] <ryanneufeld> js console in a browser says it's 0
[15:45:35] <seancurtis> gnarf: because the user agent styling for border-width in some IE versions was "medium" instead of "0" or "0px"
[15:46:00] <seancurtis> DaveMethvin: I'm not gonna add * { border-width: 0; }
[15:46:04] <ryanneufeld> seancurtis: you're missing the point. parseInt() is a native JS function.
[15:46:26] <ryanneufeld> so that's why your code doesn't work, it doesn't magically know what 'medium' means :p
[15:46:33] <gnarf> what do you want 'medium' to resolve to?
[15:46:35] <DaveMethvin> seancurtis you can either set it on specific elements or look for "medium" and try to figure out what it means
[15:46:54] <ryanneufeld> also DaveMethvin xxl also means -2 by your logic
[15:47:08] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld mind-->blown
[15:47:21] <seancurtis> gnarf: the issue is that there's no border on an element we're looking at - it's border: none or whatever, but querying .css('border-left-width') in some IE versions returns "medium"
[15:47:27] <seancurtis> it messes with calculations
[15:47:28] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: but only for xx-large values of medium
[15:47:46] <DaveMethvin> seancurtis agreed that's why yo have to look at style first
[15:48:06] <gnarf> seancurtis: +"medium" || 0
[15:48:08] <gnarf> works
[15:48:24] <ryanneufeld> seancurtis: checkout https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/NaN
[15:48:44] <ryanneufeld> or do what gnarf said, cause that shit's sexy
[15:48:49] <gnarf> i mean, if it returns "medium" and you want 0...
[15:48:50] <DaveMethvin> i think medium is like 3px or something
[15:48:52] <seancurtis> DaveMethvin: well I was going to add an isNaN() around it
[15:48:56] <seancurtis> but that got verbose
[15:49:09] <gnarf> seancurtis: just || 0
[15:49:20] <gnarf> NaN || 0 is 0
[15:49:36] <gnarf> unary plus the result from .css()
[15:49:42] <gnarf> to cast to number, and || 0
[15:49:54] <DaveMethvin> well now we're in #jquery territory
[15:49:54] <gnarf> though really
[15:49:57] <gnarf> heh
[15:50:14] <gnarf> border-left-width shouldn't be checked until you check border-left-style
[15:50:28] <seancurtis> so +"medium" || 0 === 0?
[15:50:29] <DaveMethvin> ^^
[15:50:40] <seancurtis> why does style matter?
[15:50:46] <gnarf> if border-left-style: none; border-left-width: 200px;
[15:50:50] <gnarf> ^
[15:50:52] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[15:50:53] <gnarf> width is still 200
[15:50:59] <gnarf> but there is no border
[15:51:02] <gnarf> thats why it matters
[15:51:04] <seancurtis> ah
[15:51:09] <seancurtis> didn't realise you could have a style of none
[15:51:25] <gnarf> pretty sure that getcomputedstyle will give you 0 in that case
[15:51:43] <DaveMethvin> ie8 might return style sold width medium color red
[15:51:45] <ryanneufeld> seancurtis: none is a VERY common value in css. often the default for things like borders/shaddows
[15:51:50] <seancurtis> DaveMethvin: LOL
[15:52:28] <seancurtis> unrelated but funky bug we found the other day - adding opacity to a pseudo element adds a hidden position: absolute; to it :/
[15:52:43] <seancurtis> so many bugs with buttons in IE10/11 too :(
[15:52:50] <seancurtis> button gradients
[15:52:55] <gnarf> yeah, geatComputed handles this…. http://jsfiddle.net/6k3aS/
[15:53:11] <seancurtis> IE8 has getComputed?
[15:54:21] <DaveMethvin> nope
[15:54:30] <DaveMethvin> ie8 has DIY
[15:54:48] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/6k3aS/show/ in IE8 gives you 100px
[15:55:09] <seancurtis> yeah just saw that
[15:55:12] <gnarf> so the "right" thing to support IE<9 is to check style first
[15:55:25] <seancurtis> sigh
[15:55:35] <gnarf> because "medium" is just a leak of the default, if style is "none" border is 0
[15:55:39] <gnarf> regardless
[15:56:15] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: is this a wontfix?
[15:56:16] <seancurtis> we were using outerWidth before but that was messing up :(
[15:56:40] <gnarf> seancurtis: what is the end result you need?
[15:56:44] <DaveMethvin> yes it is a wontfix, it's not that hard to check the style first and the correct way to do it is very expensive/large
[15:56:46] <seancurtis> total width of a td
[15:56:58] <gnarf> oh, td even
[15:57:10] <gnarf> you're in like the black voodoo magic realm of shitty support
[15:57:14] <seancurtis> but I think outerWidth may have been looking at the css width we'd set
[15:57:15] <gnarf> :)
[15:57:22] <seancurtis> which was 1px in order to "shrink fit" the contents
[15:57:31] <seancurtis> yeah I know all about the pains of table widths :)
[15:58:25] <gnarf> seancurtis: luckilly, this problem goes away in a land without oldie
[15:58:41] <gnarf> getBoundingClientRect probably solves your problem?
[15:59:10] <gnarf> that and getComputedStyle
[15:59:32] <gnarf> seancurtis: you could patch this with a cssHooks
[16:00:01] <DaveMethvin> i think that may be what my patch did, it's been a while
[16:00:21] <DaveMethvin> but it only solved the style issue, not the "medium" issue
[16:00:36] <gnarf> seancurtis: you can detect the behavior pretty easily, you can then csshook the border properties to check -style first, and convert "medium" to 3px (though that doesn't seem like the problem)
[16:00:37] <seancurtis> gnarf: what's the definition for oldie? <=9?
[16:00:45] <gnarf> yes
[16:00:55] <seancurtis> cool
[16:00:58] <seancurtis> I like the term :)
[16:01:18] <gnarf> actually
[16:01:19] <gnarf> <=8
[16:01:23] <gnarf> 9 is not "oldie"
[16:01:33] <seancurtis> gnarf: I've got it all working - was actually just looking for any jquery bugs so I could add them as comments in my code :)
[16:01:39] <seancurtis> ah k
[16:01:41] <seancurtis> it should b
[16:01:42] <seancurtis> be
[16:01:54] <gnarf> it has "modern" support
[16:02:03] <gnarf> es5, css3ish
[16:02:40] <gnarf> someday, perhaps, we will have "olderie", and "oldie" and...
[16:02:49] <seancurtis> ancIEnt
[16:03:01] <gnarf> 5.5 for mac?
[16:03:07] <seancurtis> auntIE
[16:03:28] <seancurtis> urgh don't remind me
[16:03:36] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: have you been reading "oldie" as "old i.e." or "oldie" ?
[16:03:42] <seancurtis> IE on mac was a travesty against software
[16:03:58] <DaveMethvin> i guess old IE gnarf
[16:03:58] <gnarf> because i'm totally going to switch to pronouncing "oldie" oldie
[16:04:09] <DaveMethvin> oldie not goodie
