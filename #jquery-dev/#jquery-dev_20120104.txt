[11:56:43] <rwaldron> gnarf when you return, can you join me in #popcorn-dev
[11:56:45] <rwaldron> thanks!
[12:32:13] <gnarf> jzaefferer: do you know what we need to do to update swarm to actually want to test of FF9? :)
[12:57:10] <jzaefferer> gnarf: make sure useragents are updated in the repo, then update the instance database to include that useragent
[12:57:24] <jzaefferer> its probably in the repo already
[12:57:43] <jzaefferer> and there's a "migration" script on the server, though that deletes all jobs so far
