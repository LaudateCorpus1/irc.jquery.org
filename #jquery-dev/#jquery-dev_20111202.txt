[12:31:31] <croby> so the very good URI regex in jzaefferer's jquery.validate doesn't seem to allow the pipe | character -- yet I see it in URLs (examples http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4694) -- anyone know any background on that?
[12:56:09] <scott_gonzalez> croby: unsure about pipes
[12:56:22] <scott_gonzalez> spec says Systems accepting IRIs MAY also deal with the printable characters in
[12:56:22] <scott_gonzalez>    US-ASCII that are not allowed in URIs, namely "<", ">", '"', space,
[12:56:22] <scott_gonzalez>    "{", "}", "|", "\", "^", and "`", in step 2 above.
[12:57:09] <croby> scott_gonzalez: yeah - and RFC1738 says "Other characters are unsafe because gateways and other transport agents are known to sometimes modify such characters. These characters are "{", "}", "|", "\", "^", "~", "[", "]", and "`".
[12:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> I could probably update the regex to include them, but not entirely sure that's a good idea
[12:57:55] <scott_gonzalez> let me test against my new regex
[12:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> scratch that, new regex builder only has email right now
[13:00:05] <scott_gonzalez> and encodeURI() encodes the pipe
[13:00:18] <scott_gonzalez> so I'd say the pipes should really be encoded
[13:01:03] <croby> scott_gonzalez: so then they shouldn't be included in the regex, you don't think?
[13:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> well, from a technical standpoint, they should probably be accepted
[13:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> but from a don't break the web perspective, they should probably not
[13:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> I no longer have the list of modifications that I used to generate the regex for the validation plugin though
[13:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> the current regex adds additional restrictions to meet user expectation of what a URL is
[13:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'll make a note about this for when I write the new builder
[13:03:33] <croby> awesome, thanks for the input Scott
[13:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> no problem :-)
