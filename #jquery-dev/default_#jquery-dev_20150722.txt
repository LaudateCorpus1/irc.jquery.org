[08:28:52] <m_gol> arschmitz: I'm thinking about all these ways on how to escape Android 2.3 and they all end in the same dark place :P
[08:29:32] <arschmitz> yeah 
[08:29:40] <arschmitz> hybrid is the killer
[08:29:56] <arschmitz> because you generally just support "android" not a specific version
[08:33:27] <m_gol> judging by various stats from the Android dashboard, gs.statcounter.com, netmarketshare.com etc. it seems Android 2.3 has market share between 1.4 & 3.6% of all mobile
[08:33:45] <m_gol> I wonder how's that possible when those phones are still on sale :P
[08:33:50] <arschmitz> m_gol: i have not looked but is there any timeline for google dropping support from the play store from 2.3 that you have seen
[08:34:00] <m_gol> not really
[08:34:03] <arschmitz> i have only found where they stoped providing patches for the webview
[08:34:06] <m_gol> yeah
[08:34:13] <m_gol> pretty scary, that one ;)
[08:34:14] <arschmitz> they no longer provide patches pre 4.3 for the webview
[08:34:20] <arschmitz> which is crazy
[08:34:20] <m_gol> yes, this really puzzled me
[08:34:32] <m_gol> I have no idea how they could justify that
[08:34:42] <arschmitz> it does not seem like they tried
[08:34:55] <arschmitz> to justify it at all
[08:35:09] <gibson042> I'm generally the backcompat packrat, but I don't think I would _insist_ on much beyond "Android 2.3 can load the master branch"
[08:35:29] <m_gol> it's 48.4% of all Androids according to their own data
[08:35:58] <gibson042> correct syntax is a must, minimal runtime exceptions is nice to have, mostly correct behavior is good enough
[08:36:25] <m_gol> gibson042 arschmitz: it still seems to me hardly anyone tests on those devices considering all the bugs we discover that no one reports to us besides ourselves
[08:37:11] <arschmitz> m_gol: to be honest i dont remember the last 2.3 bug report we got on mobile
[08:37:27] <arschmitz> at all
[08:38:23] <m_gol> yeah
[08:39:21] <m_gol> so maybe a parse error would be too much but I don't think it's worth it to try to pass everything since no one seems to care
[08:40:08] <arschmitz> ok question
[08:40:18] <arschmitz> are you proposing this for 3.0 or 4.0
[08:40:41] <m_gol> we have no idea when 4.0 will come so I'm thinking about 3.0
[08:40:42] <gibson042> it's kind of the case already, for 1.x/2.x
[08:40:47] <m_gol> yeah
[08:40:57] <gibson042> Android 2.3 doesn't pass all tests
[08:40:58] <m_gol> we don't pass all the tests there and we never have
[08:41:23] <arschmitz> right but we are at least aware of regressions 
[08:41:28] <m_gol> I've spent some effort on making >=4.0 pass as they were failing as well (not sure if they still don't do on 2.1/1.11)
[08:41:57] <arschmitz> there is a difference between just making sure it parses and not lowering the current support
[08:42:05] <m_gol> it's hard to see a regression when you're used to this one being always red ;)
[08:42:47] <arschmitz> yeah i hear you there we were red for months because of core :-p
[08:42:55] <m_gol> ;)
[08:42:59] <m_gol> we could add a policy of no new non-critical bug fixes, without removing the ones that are already there
[08:43:18] <arschmitz> i guess what i would say is because this is so late in the process for 3.0
[08:43:21] <arschmitz> post alpha
[08:43:30] <m_gol> this was before my time but AFAIK that's what was decided for IE6-7 some time ago
[08:43:56] <arschmitz> i would say i would like to see it be just prevent regressions for 3.0 
[08:44:05] <arschmitz> and then drop after
[08:44:30] <arschmitz> m_gol: yes thats what happened for ie6-7 but the difference i think is that was announced like almost a year in advance
[08:44:37] <arschmitz> not post alpha
[08:44:37] <m_gol> we might have 3.1.0 some time later if we have enough non-compat-breaking changes that we want to apply
[08:44:44] <m_gol> I see
[08:45:02] <arschmitz> there was a blog post specificly about the change in advance
[08:45:10] <m_gol> so you propose we make it public that we'll drop Android 2.3 support in 4.0, whenever that one comes?
[08:46:50] <m_gol> You might consider this a regression: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1786. Although it was already broken in 2.1, just worked in 1.11; now both fail
[08:52:34] <arschmitz> m_gol: how strict you want to be on regression i think is up to you 
[08:57:07] <arschmitz> but yes i think that would be my suggestion

[09:17:46] <arschmitz> m_gol: i guess part of my concern is mobile is about to release an alpha in the next month or so as well
[09:17:55] <arschmitz> so if you drop now that more or less means we should too
[09:18:57] <arschmitz> though i have to admit i do like the idea of just stopping any fixes now but not knowingly removing any fixes like we did with ie6-7
[10:21:28] <m_gol> arschmitz: does Mobile work only with one concrete jQuery version or older as well?
[10:22:09] <m_gol> if it works with many versions like UI then you can always support Android 2.3 but only if used with an older jQuery version
[10:22:15] <m_gol> this is not necessarily *so bad*
[10:22:25] <m_gol> 1.11/2.1 lines are quite stable
[10:22:43] <m_gol> we have some Safari fixes but overall nothing very critical was reported; they should be solid
[10:36:38] <arschmitz> m_gol: we discussed this in dev leads and some options and going to go over this in mobile meeting as well
[10:37:12] <arschmitz> not against dropping support just need to figure out the right way i think
[10:40:09] <ozptptp_> Hey there - what support does jQuery have for web components? Thanks in advance. I couldn't find any documentation.
[10:43:17] <ozptptp_> specifically polymer
[10:43:30] <ozptptp_> or should I just use mdl?
[11:12:48] <m_gol> ozptptp_: there are some issues like https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1748, https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1784 & https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1976, PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/2043
[11:13:08] <m_gol> ozptptp_: we want to improve but carefully, to not start handling behavior that is still up to change
[11:19:47] <ozptptp_> thanks m_gol
[11:25:55] <m_gol> oztptp_: we sometimes get bug reports like https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/1979 that /deep/ etc. doesn't work and we don't necessarily fix those ones, here it turned out that /deep/ changed to >>> and it will most likely be removed from the spec so it pays to not jump ship and be a little careful
[11:28:48] <ozptptp_> That is really cool
[11:28:55] <ozptptp_> .
[11:28:57] <ozptptp_> Thanks!
