[13:34:14] <Metis> hey
[13:53:01] <mikesherov> ajpiano: you here?
[13:53:01] <ircjsbot> mikesherov, you have one new message, from gnarf (16 hours and 53 minutes ago). Tell me if you want to read it (“read”).
[13:53:14] <mikesherov> ircjsbot: read
[13:53:14] <ircjsbot> mikesherov, from gnarf, 16 hours and 53 minutes ago: hey - you should get ahold of jzaefferer after you make an account on speakerrate so he can add you to our talk
[13:55:00] <mikesherov> jzaefferer: you here?
[13:55:38] <gnarf> hey mikesherov
[13:55:40] <gnarf> reviewing that shrink pull from the airport
[13:55:48] <mikesherov> hey gnarf
[13:55:51] <gnarf> prolly got another 40 minutes before my plane boards, its been delayed
[13:55:56] <mikesherov> I saw your comments
[13:55:59] <mikesherov> that sucks
[13:56:35] <mikesherov> gnarf: I need to fix my slides from the talk, I have a few typos and repeats in there
[13:57:01] <gnarf> did ajpiano ever push it after we did it?
[13:57:27] <gnarf> he's prolly sitting at the hotel watching the soccer game
[13:57:28] <mikesherov> yeah, it's on events.jquery.org with the wrong link to speakrrate too
[13:57:29] <gnarf> :)
[13:57:52] <mikesherov> btw, about the jqcolor isNaN check, I couldn't come up with a case where that would be hit. I can add the check back in if you'd like.
[14:01:10] <gnarf> replied ;)
[14:01:19] <gnarf> it probably was the original place that was done
[14:01:36] <gnarf> then the other one got added cuz it was better, so the old is also prolly unnessecary
[14:01:48] <mikesherov> ok
[14:01:54] <mikesherov> so I'll leave it out
[14:02:24] <mikesherov> hmm, maybe it's an IE thing
[14:02:27] <mikesherov> I'll double check
[14:02:50] <gnarf> so that regexp change
[14:02:56] <gnarf> the string is being .toLowerCase()d?
[14:03:06] <gnarf> yeah - it is
[14:03:08] <gnarf> coo
[14:03:28] <mikesherov> yeah, look for .toLowercase
[14:04:41] <gnarf> yeah
[14:04:43] <gnarf> i found it ;)
[14:04:57] <gnarf> looks good to me
[14:05:01] <gnarf> feel free to land it
[14:05:20] <mikesherov> OK, cool
[14:05:34] <mikesherov> I'm going to just roll in some suggestions from scottgonzalez first
[14:05:37] <mikesherov> and then land
[14:05:40] <mikesherov> thanks for the review
[14:17:08] <gnarf> np
[14:17:18] <gnarf> my plane still isn't even at the gate yet
[14:17:22] <gnarf> :(
[14:17:30] <mikesherov> ugh
[14:17:45] <mikesherov> now you know how the "error in demo" guy felt
[14:18:44] <Metis> hey mike or gnarf, i asked a question yesterday about issues i was having with building the jQuery source
[14:18:54] <Metis> i was wondering if you two had any advice on it?
[14:20:55] <gnarf> Metis: My backscroll is gone - can you repeat it?
[14:21:29] <Metis> sure
[14:21:31] <Metis> one sec
[14:21:54] <Metis> i need your help. i just cloned the jquery core and am having an usual error when i am trying to run grunt.cmd "CreateProcessW: The system cannot find the file specified" after "Running compare_size:files (compare_size) task
[14:22:09] <_ramok1> hi
[14:22:11] <Metis> i have followed all the instructions
[14:22:36] <Metis> and installed cygwin
[14:22:41] <Metis> with the right packages
[14:22:41] <mikesherov> Metis, you have grunt installed using: npm install -g grunt
[14:22:45] <Metis> this is Windows btw
[14:22:45] <_ramok1> the autocomplete lplugin from ui had  several bugs with focusing with th emauscourse . do you guys know, if this was fixed?
[14:22:51] <Metis> yep
[14:23:04] <Metis> it is when i run grunt that i get the issue
[14:23:27] <Metis> or do i need to run npm install -g grunt on the jquery folder?
[14:23:34] <mikesherov> and then you did `npm install` from the jquery directory
[14:23:38] <tbranyen> mikesherov: -g means global
[14:23:43] <Metis> kk
[14:23:43] <tbranyen> er
[14:23:45] <Metis> yep
[14:23:45] <tbranyen> Metis
[14:23:47] <mikesherov> yes, g means global
[14:23:51] <Metis> did the npm install
[14:24:05] <mikesherov> and you're having problems with compare-size?
[14:24:12] <Metis> yeah
[14:24:15] <mikesherov> hmm, chadkillingsworth was having same issue
[14:24:39] <Metis> there seems to be a registered bug for it in the grunt bug queue

[14:29:15] <mikesherov> Metis: you can patch it yourself if you don't feel like waiting for 4.0.0

[14:29:17] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on grunt by Richard D. Worth (2m, 5d ago): grunt.utils.spawn: Use 'which' on cmd before spawn(cmd, ...) to avoid error on Windows with some commands. Fixes #155 - Error: CreateProcessW: The system cannot find the file specified.
[14:29:30] <mikesherov> the other thing you can do is double install grunt
[14:29:46] <mikesherov> do: "npm install grunt" in the jquery folder
[14:29:49] <mikesherov> without the -g
[14:30:18] <Metis> kk
[14:33:04] <Metis> the double install didn't work but i'll see if i can patch it myself
[14:34:06] <mikesherov> k, let me know
[14:36:51] <mikesherov> gnarf: i landed my PR
[14:37:32] <gnarf> npm install -g grunt ; npm install ; grunt.cmd :)
