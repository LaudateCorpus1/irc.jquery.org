[11:57:27] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: The new budget sheet looks good. Will you just reference the old for the priorities?
[11:57:41] <scott_gonzalez> Also, the notes for contracts are a bit strange when viewed in the new spreadsheet :-P
[11:58:00] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i assume there will be some in-person discussion ... didn't want to lose your notes
[11:58:24] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically the comments about "if part time, then rate = X"
[11:58:33] <DaveMethvin> which is the rate :D
[11:58:34] <scott_gonzalez> Since the full time rates were originally in weeks.
[11:58:52] <scott_gonzalez> That was the purpose of the note, not that it matters for budget discussions.
[12:08:54] <gnarf> DaveMethvin / scott_gonzalez - need you to check your ~/.ssh/known_hosts
[12:09:12] <gnarf> don't want your build process to blow up cuz you can't ssh to code.origin.jquery.com
[12:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm on a new MBP, so everything is going to blow up :-P
[12:09:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: :)
[12:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of which, I probably need to get you new SSH keys...
[12:10:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you can't copy your old id_rsa? :)
[12:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You think I have any clue how this stuff works?
[12:11:04] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i would suggest adding a passphrase to your ~/.ssh/id_rsa (lemme find a walkthrough)
[12:11:12] <gnarf> or do you already use passphrase?
[12:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> I do.
[12:11:48] <gnarf> awesome
[12:11:59] <gnarf> copy your ~/.ssh/id_rsa* to your dropbox
[12:12:13] <gnarf> and then put it on any machine that you need to be scott_gonzalez in the jquery network on
[12:12:56] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't use a passphrase on my old laptop.
[12:13:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just get you my new info.
[12:13:20] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, okay just got back to the kbd
[12:14:16] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, you want my private key in id_rsa? howzat work?
[12:15:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ok - you can convert the old key
[12:15:59] <gnarf> add a passphrase to it
[12:16:05] <gnarf> its not hard
[12:16:06] <gnarf> its like
[12:16:17] <gnarf> openssl rsa -in id_rsa -out id_rsa.pass
[12:16:22] <gnarf> and type a passphrase
[13:56:05] <afahim> hey, anyone here familiar with how jquery UI tabs were coded up?
[13:57:10] <afahim> I wanna ask how do the tabs resize themselves to fit the format (size, font, etc) of the text that the tabs hold
[13:57:37] <afahim> as in how do the tab width and height change according to the format of the text contained in the tab heading
[14:00:09] <afahim> is it done using CSS or some sort of programming
[14:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> ?topic @afahim
[14:26:22] <bot-t> afahim, Topic: jQuery development chat. S
[14:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> bot-t: You're broken.
[14:26:34] <bot-t> scott_gonzalez, Is that a question?
[14:26:58] <scott_gonzalez> afahim: Use #jquery for support.
[14:30:40] <gnarf> ?channels
[14:30:40] <bot-t> For support please go to #jquery or #jquerymobile. Development Channels: #jquery-dev - #jqueryui-dev - #jquerymobile-dev ; Meetings held in#jquery-meeting
[14:30:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^^^
[20:58:48] <Apoc_> http://jsfiddle.net/Apoc/PhFrP/2/ - I want a Select DropDown menu after the title of a Dialog box. - The Select tag can be seen; but onclick nothing happens. Can someone tell me if I am doing something incorrectly?
