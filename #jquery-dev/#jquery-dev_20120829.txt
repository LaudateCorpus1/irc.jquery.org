[08:12:31] <timmywil> testswarm's ie7 seems to be hanging frequently
[08:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> timmywil: Is it loading fine and then hanging on refresh?
[08:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, testswarm, nevermind.
[08:45:47] <scott_gonzalez> I've been noticing problems using BrowserStack via the web.
[08:46:03] <timmywil> yea, could be server load
[08:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'll load a page and it'll work fine, but after a few refreshes, it just hangs and won't load the page.

[09:01:10] <DaveMethvin> just in time mikesherov
[09:01:17] <DaveMethvin> i had a question for  you
[09:01:20] <DaveMethvin> http://jsfiddle.net/uMhJs/1/
[09:01:31] <DaveMethvin> does that act funny for you in ie8?
[09:01:43] <mikesherov> one sec
[09:02:00] <DaveMethvin> i get 0~0 on load, but the correct answers when i click the Run button a second time
[09:02:21] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: thought that said the "Ruin" button and i was like
[09:02:24] <ajpiano> how'd you get my button
[09:02:39] <mikesherov> I do not experience that
[09:03:00] <DaveMethvin> really? in ie8 it gives the right answer the first time?
[09:03:15] <mikesherov> yes
[09:03:16] <DaveMethvin> that was on browserstack, lemme try a vm
[09:03:36] <mikesherov> oh, there it goes
[09:03:42] <mikesherov> took two times
[09:03:43] <DaveMethvin> whoop there it is
[09:04:47] <mikesherov> intermittent
[09:04:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[09:04:53] <mikesherov> timing based
[09:04:56] <DaveMethvin> consistent on browserstack
[09:05:01] <DaveMethvin> this version only has one alert http://jsfiddle.net/uMhJs/1/
[09:05:11] <mikesherov> on browserstack, I get intermittent
[09:05:47] <DaveMethvin> it's strange b/c the alert is onload, by then any of our feature detects etc shoudl be long done
[09:06:26] <mikesherov> window.height() is not behind a feature detect
[09:06:37] <mikesherov> also, I wonder what happens if you do it not in an IFRAME
[09:07:14] <mikesherov> http://jsfiddle.net/uMhJs/1/embedded/result/ works every time
[09:08:07] <mikesherov> oh, btw, I have one last PR before 1.8.1
[09:08:44] <DaveMethvin> strange,, http://api.jquery.com/Width/ works consistently too, let me try having *some* content
[09:08:50] <DaveMethvin> what's your PR mikesherov
[09:09:16] <DaveMethvin> if you say "css rewrite" imma clobber you!
[09:09:25] <mikesherov> HAHAAH
[09:09:26] <mikesherov> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/916
[09:09:30] <DaveMethvin> ah the col one, yeah thanks
[09:09:55] <mikesherov> np
[09:11:32] <DaveMethvin> yeah that test has something to do with being in an iframe inside the jsfiddle ui, you can see the alert come up before the iframe is showing
[09:12:06] <DaveMethvin> perhaps jsfiddle hides it and sometimes ends up showing after the page has loaded, i dunno

[09:48:42] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/62#issuecomment-8128578 is there a proper way to write commit msgs?
[09:49:02] <ryanneufeld> I have a fix for this for jzaefferer, and I'd like to get it in for him
[09:49:21] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: dunno about commit msgs
[09:49:34] <jzaefferer> but I'd like to see the commit :-)

[09:50:05] <jqcommit> [jquery/master] Sizzle: POS selectors make more extensive use of tokenization. Fixes #12303. - Timmy Willison
[09:51:51] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: why are there 42 commits? https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/pull/71
[09:52:05] <jzaefferer> and what's the point of a PR if you instant-merge it?
[09:52:11] <ryanneufeld> oops
[09:52:15] <jzaefferer> did you press the green button?
[09:52:20] <ryanneufeld> I think so
[09:52:28] <ryanneufeld> WHY IS IT GREEN IF I SHOULDN"T PRESS IT :(
[09:52:53] <ryanneufeld> I think the other commits are from my pulls from upstream into my fork
[09:53:35] <ryanneufeld> oh god, I hope I didn't ruin it
[09:55:07] <ryanneufeld> okay, I'm gonna say... that didn't go nearly as I expected it to...
[09:55:29] <ryanneufeld> oh shit, yeah, I need to undo that
[09:55:38] <ryanneufeld> I merged stage into master
[09:55:45] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I need some help here
[09:56:52] <jzaefferer> at least you have a merge commit, so you can git-revert that merge commit...
[09:57:18] <jzaefferer> beyond that I don't know what might be broken now
[09:57:23] <ryanneufeld> okay, i'm more of an SVN guy
[09:57:59] <jzaefferer> oh well, probably better to wait for gnarf then
[10:03:10] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[10:03:11] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Core build #352: FIXED in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Core/352/
[10:03:11] <doesallmagic> dave.methvin: Fix #12243, $("col").width() should return the column's width. Close gh-916.
[10:09:36] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: I think a git reset --hard c9df645e8959d51db193b127f375af2748066ebe will get me to the commits before the merge
[10:09:50] <ryanneufeld> then if i push that, it should undo it
[10:11:56] <gibson042> timmywil that fixes the ticket that I had, right?
[10:12:11] <gibson042> I've had work stuff crop up but was planning to revisit it tonight
[10:12:16] <jzaefferer> ryanneufeld: well, a force push
[10:12:24] <jzaefferer> usually a bad idea, once a commit is published
[10:12:30] <jzaefferer> I can't tell what this affects
[10:12:32] <timmywil> gibson042: it does, but we still have issues with :not( complex with POS ) and compound POS
[10:12:40] <gibson042> ok, cool
[10:12:49] <ryanneufeld> well, forcing it back to where it was shouldn't be bad right?
[10:12:51] <gibson042> well, not cool
[10:12:51] <timmywil> which aren't critical for 1.8.1, but I created an issue
[10:12:57] <gibson042> but I can take those for sure
[10:15:13] <timmywil> ryanneufeld, jzaefferer: reverting a merge should take care of it and avoid a force push
[10:15:25] <timmywil> might need the -m option
[10:15:32] <ryanneufeld> timmywil: lets pretent I'm a total noob
[10:15:39] <ryanneufeld> and have no idea how that's done
[10:15:54] <ryanneufeld> also, I have a clone of the repo locally
[10:16:02] <timmywil> ok, lemme check out intrastructure and take a look
[10:16:28] <ryanneufeld> timmywil: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commits/
[10:17:11] <timmywil> woops, I don't have access
[10:17:29] <timmywil> must be private
[10:17:46] <ryanneufeld> tis
[10:26:20] <timmywil> ryanneufeld: ok, try copying the commit sha for the merge commit, then do git revert -m 1 commit_sha
[10:26:46] <timmywil> ryanneufeld: that will take you to the git commit editor, just save and exit as usual
[10:26:54] <ryanneufeld> yup
[10:27:11] <ryanneufeld> [puppet-master 6b705f9] Revert "Merge pull request #71 from ryanneufeld/puppet-stage"
[10:27:14] <ryanneufeld> looks like what I want
[10:27:24] <ryanneufeld> so if i git push origin puppet-master
[10:27:42] <ryanneufeld> would that push the fix?
[10:27:45] <timmywil> it should push a commit that reverts all the changes made by the marge
[10:27:58] <timmywil> so ya
[10:28:13] <timmywil> you can also diff branches
[10:28:15] <timmywil> to check

[10:28:23] <doesallmagic> timmywillisn: Sizzle: POS selectors make more extensive use of tokenization. Fixes #12303.
[10:28:23] <timmywil> so git diff master if you want it to be the same as master
[10:28:27] <timmywil> nothing should output
[10:29:39] <ryanneufeld> looks good
[10:29:41] <ryanneufeld> Thanks
[10:29:54] <timmywil> np :)
[10:32:31] <ryanneufeld> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/pull/72 that looks more like it
[10:34:28] <ajpiano> gnarf: yt?
[10:51:26] <ryanneufeld> timmywil: we're currently using 1.7.1 in prod, does sizzle cache selectors like "#someid > form" in any efficient way?
[10:52:05] <timmywil> ryanneufeld: not in 1.7.1, but that selector would use qsa
[10:53:00] <ryanneufeld> so it would, in < 1.8.x, be more efficient to cache in our implementation code then?
[10:54:09] <timmywil> ryanneufeld: well, it will always be effecient to cache selections. Only re-select if there are dom changes
[10:54:31] <timmywil> Sizzle's cache in 1.8 has to do with selector compilation and tokenization
[10:54:49] <ryanneufeld> oic
[10:54:59] <ryanneufeld> you'll have to explain that to me sometime
[10:55:01] <timmywil> it doesn't cache the results because it would have to pay attention to DOM changes across browsers, which is another library in itself
[10:55:07] <ryanneufeld> ah
[10:55:23] <ryanneufeld> so then what is it caching then?
[10:55:42] <timmywil> every selector is compiled into a function that is run over the possible set of elements
[10:55:54] <timmywil> if the function returns true, the element is added to the results
[10:55:59] <timmywil> that function is cached
[10:56:10] <timmywil> so it doesn't need to recreate it if the same selector is run
[10:56:18] <ryanneufeld> oic
[10:57:06] <ryanneufeld> so caching the jquery collection resulting from a selection is still A Good Thing To Do (tm)
[10:59:00] <timmywil> yup
[11:00:10] <ryanneufeld> thx

[11:43:59] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: that merge was a total whoops moment, Not sure why GH does that... why wouldn't it try to match the branch names... seesh
[11:44:22] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: i don't suppose you have a few minutes to poke around with some events stuff with me?
[11:44:31] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I can try....
[11:44:46] <ajpiano> we'll see
[11:44:51] <ryanneufeld> wassap
[11:45:05] <ajpiano> the main thing right now is that there used to be a post-receive hook on https://github.com/jquery/web-events that would update the site whenever you pushed to master
[11:45:21] <ajpiano> doesn't seem to be working
[11:45:27] <ryanneufeld> that gives me a 404... do In not has access?
[11:45:35] <ajpiano> i guess you don't :(
[11:45:41] <ajpiano> danheberden is on vacay and i can't reach gnarf
[11:45:49] <ryanneufeld> not events.jquery.org is it?
[11:46:05] <ajpiano> nope
[11:46:14] <ryanneufeld> i can has accesses??
[11:46:32] <ajpiano> i don't have the access to give you access
[11:46:40] <ryanneufeld> bourns
[11:46:46] <ajpiano> yeah
[11:46:54] <ajpiano> otherwise i'd be checking if the hook was set up there
[11:47:13] <ryanneufeld> hmm, well it seems I am not of much use to you right now
[11:47:18] <ajpiano> alas
[11:47:30] <ryanneufeld> that's sad, I wanted to be useful after wrecking the repo this morning
[11:47:49] <ajpiano> woulda been convenient
[11:47:53] <ryanneufeld> I should add that timmywil helped me un-fuck it
[11:48:57] <timmywil> dave might have access
[11:49:04] <timmywil> DaveMethvin
[11:49:11] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: I can has access to https://github.com/jquery/web-events ?
[11:49:20] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: plzkthxbai
[11:49:41] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: that isn't a VM instance is it?
[11:49:58] <ajpiano> i haven't a clue
[11:50:10] <ryanneufeld> dang
[11:50:28] <ryanneufeld> back to being sans-use
[11:50:35] <ajpiano> i have a feeling it got moved over to a new box a few weeks ago and the hook went poof at that point
[11:53:45] <ryanneufeld> could happen
[11:53:58] <ryanneufeld> if you can track down if it's a VM instance I might be able to get something for you
[11:54:45] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: does the IP of the box help at all
[11:56:32] <ryanneufeld> might do
[11:56:40] <ajpiano> 216.70.110.52
[11:57:29] * ryanneufeld looks
[11:58:56] <ryanneufeld> eol1.jquery.com
[12:03:01] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: Sorry dude, I'm not sure what to make of it here.
[12:03:05] <ryanneufeld> all I can see is "# eol1 - end of lifed servers"
[12:03:10] <ajpiano> no prob, was grasping at straws
[12:03:19] <ajpiano> hey DaveMethvin did you see ryanneufeld's ping a few mins ago
[12:03:25] <DaveMethvin> just saw it
[12:03:31] <DaveMethvin> lemme see if i have the powah
[12:03:54] <ajpiano> if you do, add me too
[12:05:02] <ryanneufeld> adding ajpiano might be more important than adding me
[12:05:50] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano looks like you have access already? ryanneufeld i just aded infra and you are in that group
[12:05:58] <ryanneufeld> ok
[12:06:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah ajpiano you're in as a result of being on team-web-events
[12:07:07] <ryanneufeld> k, I'm in
[12:07:10] <ryanneufeld> now what do I do?
[12:08:37] <ajpiano> sorry, just got pulled on the phone, give me a few
[12:09:52] <DaveMethvin> hey ryanneufeld do you have access to the email setup for jquery.org/com?
[12:09:56] <DaveMethvin> i need an alias set up
[12:10:03] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: I don't think so
[12:10:17] <ryanneufeld> I also don't think i should be trusted with that just yet :p
[12:10:18] <DaveMethvin> that's me too ... uh i dunno if i have access :D
[12:10:22] <ajpiano> we need there to be a post-receive hook
[12:10:47] <DaveMethvin> so in the repo near the top there shoudl be an Admin link
[12:11:03] <DaveMethvin> i can set it up if you guys don't have/see it
[12:11:12] <ryanneufeld> I have no admin link
[12:11:16] <DaveMethvin> in admin there is a Service Hook section
[12:11:27] <ryanneufeld> I am not an admin, so it's all on you DaveMethvin
[12:11:41] <DaveMethvin> i have no idea what I'm doing! :P
[12:11:44] <DaveMethvin> we're doomed
[12:11:54] <ryanneufeld> did you not see what I did to infra this am?
[12:11:54] <DaveMethvin> ok so what hook are we setting up
[12:12:01] <ryanneufeld> and you're willing to trust ME?
[12:12:02] <ryanneufeld> lol
[12:12:12] <DaveMethvin> don't tell me you deleted the plugins site
[12:12:22] <DaveMethvin> we have strictly delegated that to ajpiano
[12:12:41] * ryanneufeld looks down while whistling and digging his toe in the ground
[12:13:02] <ryanneufeld> no, i accidentaly the whole thing
[12:13:09] <ryanneufeld> and merged puppet-stage into puppet-master
[12:13:23] <DaveMethvin> oooh
[12:13:31] <DaveMethvin> that's gonna leave a mark
[12:13:45] <DaveMethvin> so, here's the info on post-receive hooks btw: https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks
[12:14:16] <DaveMethvin> basically github posts to the url we give it with a boatload of info and we can do whatever, like build or pull or stuff
[12:15:06] <ryanneufeld> DaveMethvin: I was able to remove the mark, but there is evidence that it happened.
[12:15:23] <ryanneufeld> I could have forced it to go away, but meh, I own my mistakes
[12:15:37] <DaveMethvin> well we need SOMETHING to razz you about, don't take that away from us
[12:15:54] <timmywil> hmm, looks like you could fake the post, right?
[12:16:08] <ryanneufeld> oh, I'm certain, as the sun comes up every day, that you will find something better than that
[12:16:32] * DaveMethvin scrolls back to find out what timmywil means
[12:16:36] <timmywil> I guess you could restrict to posts to github
[12:17:06] <timmywil> from*
[12:17:08] <DaveMethvin> yeah they tell us the ips
[12:17:21] <timmywil> gotcha
[12:18:04] <DaveMethvin> The Public IP addresses for these hooks are: 207.97.227.253, 50.57.128.197, 108.171.174.178.
[12:18:12] <timmywil> lol
[12:18:29] <timmywil> thanks
[12:18:46] <DaveMethvin> you can always count on me for copy pasta
[12:19:33] <ryanneufeld> that's my least favorite kind of pasta
[12:20:12] <timmywil> echo "www.google.com dave" > /etc/hosts
[12:23:44] <DaveMethvin> man, ever since I updated to chrome 21 yesterday gmail has NOT been happy
[12:23:49] <DaveMethvin> i have to refresh every half hour or so
[12:24:56] <ryanneufeld> you'd think they'd have that shit sorted wouldn you?
[12:25:46] <DaveMethvin> you don't think the chrome team and the gmail team talk do you?
[12:26:06] <DaveMethvin> man, that would be like if jquery core released a version that broke mobile and ui ... oh nevermind
[12:29:40] <ryanneufeld> yeah....
[12:35:21] <ryanneufeld> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=on3JCwnwHbU&feature=g-vrec
[12:39:26] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i never got the admin flag there
[12:39:54] <ajpiano> and i also don't know where the post commit hook lives
[12:40:01] <ajpiano> bascially i just hope gnarf surfaces soon
[12:40:37] <DaveMethvin> ah, i just figured it out
[12:40:41] <DaveMethvin> you have admin now ajpiano
[12:41:08] <ajpiano> hrm, weird, there's def no hook url set up
[12:41:16] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: are you certain that's the correct repo?
[12:41:17] <DaveMethvin> agreed
[12:41:37] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: what you're looking at on http://events.jquery.org is coming from that repo
[12:41:53] <ryanneufeld> okay
[12:42:03] <ajpiano> the events.jquery.org repo is like, for the future
[12:42:05] <ajpiano> in the new wordpress setup
[12:42:09] <ryanneufeld> I'm standing up a vm here to poke around
[12:42:20] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano ryanneufeld yeah the events.jquery.org repo has hooks
[12:42:30] <DaveMethvin> but i am assuming it's not cooked yet
[12:42:39] <ajpiano> yeah
[12:42:46] <DaveMethvin> well in that case
[12:42:59] <DaveMethvin> the old style used to be to commit and then run some shell script to update
[12:43:09] <DaveMethvin> at least that's what the jquery.com home page did
[12:43:27] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: around the time of the conf though, i vividly recollect just pushing to master on web-events, and the changes being reflected on the site
[12:47:58] <ajpiano> i just don't know what changed in the interim
[12:50:36] <ryanneufeld> where's the .org repos hook point?
[12:51:24] <ajpiano> i don't know
[12:54:50] <ryanneufeld> sorry ajpiano, looks like we're waiting on gnarf
[12:55:02] <ajpiano> yeah, i texted/called
[12:55:09] <ryanneufeld> ah, k
[12:55:28] <ryanneufeld> when you get ahold of him, maybe lemme know what the solution was.
[12:55:39] <ajpiano> yeah i'm sure he'll be here once here's here
[13:22:26] <ryanneufeld> is there a way when you have more than one doc ready call, to specify an order?
[13:22:58] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to resolve an issue where a plugin I need is being loaded after the code that's calling it, and a document.ready() isn't helping
[13:23:40] <DaveMethvin> ryanneufeld: they  happen in the order they're attached
[13:23:49] <ryanneufeld> dang
[13:24:17] <ryanneufeld> I can't even use a deferred for this...
[13:24:50] <DaveMethvin> well normally you'd have the code that needed the plugin in some code block that wouldn't be called until the plugin was there
[13:25:01] <DaveMethvin> like they do with AMD or some other module loader
[13:25:05] <DaveMethvin> if you really need it async
[13:25:15] <ryanneufeld> yeah, we don't have AMD yet
[13:25:17] <ryanneufeld> :S
[13:25:31] <DaveMethvin> so is the script loaded async then?
[13:25:40] <ryanneufeld> scrupts are concat on the server
[13:25:47] <gnarf> hey
[13:25:50] <DaveMethvin> well get them to change the order!
[13:25:51] <ryanneufeld> but it's the way that put them together
[13:25:53] <DaveMethvin> hey gnarf
[13:26:04] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano and ryanneufeld were lookin for ya
[13:26:12] <gnarf> so first up - ajpiano what you need
[13:26:17] <gnarf> and ryanneufeld what did you break? :)
[13:26:42] <ryanneufeld> oh, i fixed it
[13:26:43] <ryanneufeld> lol
[13:26:47] <ryanneufeld> but it was bad
[13:26:56] <ryanneufeld> I accidentally the whole thing
[13:27:01] <gnarf> did you merge stable over to master?
[13:27:05] <ryanneufeld> merged stage into master
[13:27:10] <ryanneufeld> yes...
[13:27:13] <ryanneufeld> but it's been undid
[13:27:14] <gnarf> i could push -f the old master
[13:27:29] <ryanneufeld> was advised against that by timmy
[13:27:48] <gnarf> we avoid push -f's
[13:27:50] <ryanneufeld> did the revert -m 1 <hash>
[13:27:55] <ryanneufeld> as the commit log will show
[13:28:00] <gnarf> coo
[13:28:15] <gnarf> glad it didn't blow up
[13:28:25] <gnarf> how long was that commit on puppet-master?
[13:28:31] <ryanneufeld> < 1hour
[13:28:34] <gnarf> hrm
[13:28:38] <ryanneufeld> afaik
[13:28:42] <gnarf> thats long enough that some machines might of updated to it
[13:28:53] <gnarf> only takes like 5-10 min
[13:28:55] <ajpiano> gnarf: there used to be a post receive hook on web-events
[13:28:57] <ryanneufeld> once it was reverted it should have updated to the revert
[13:29:02] <ajpiano> that would update events.jquery.org on a push to master
[13:29:05] <ajpiano> it appears to be gone
[13:29:33] <gnarf> ajpiano: sorry, ill look into that (i didn't know i had post-receives to look at on those)
[13:29:47] <ajpiano> ah, yeah, i figured it happened in the switchover
[13:30:39] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: lemme know if I really hosed something...
[13:33:53] <ajpiano> gnarf: if, in the interim, you could do a pull onto the box, that would also be great
[13:36:12] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: nah - everything on puppet-stage is pretty much stable
[13:36:29] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: some of the machines might of picked up that config from master tho
[13:36:38] <gnarf> so - beware the big green PR merge button ;)
[13:37:02] <ryanneufeld> why is it green if i should not press it!
[13:37:19] <gnarf> :)
[13:37:27] <gnarf> because its "good to go" ?
[13:37:41] <ryanneufeld> fair nuff
[13:38:22] <ryanneufeld> thankfully git makes it easy enough to fix
[13:40:39] <gnarf> ajpiano: confirm your changes are there?
[13:40:58] <ajpiano> gnarf: awesome
[13:40:59] <ajpiano> yes
[13:41:09] <gnarf> ajpiano: you want the index redirected?
[13:41:18] <ajpiano> not yet
[13:41:29] <ajpiano> will let you know when
[13:41:51] <ajpiano> gnarf: is the hook in place or just did a pull
[13:42:01] <gnarf> ajpiano: still working on the hook
[13:42:10] <gnarf> ajpiano: not entirely sure how it worked before :)
[13:42:54] <ajpiano> i think it brought up a picture on a monitor that a bunch of gerbils stared at and then copied the appropriate files onto floppy disk after reading the instructions
[13:42:57] <ajpiano> glwtd
[13:45:13] <gnarf> not sure how they handled needing the ssh key
[13:45:25] <gnarf> or at least I can't figure out what ssh key they used
[13:46:18] <ajpiano> gnarf: are there other hooks that require a gh acct/ssh key?
[13:46:24] <ajpiano> in the ecosystem?
[13:46:29] <gnarf> not that I've setup yet
[13:46:34] <ajpiano> ah
[13:46:38] <ajpiano> was gonna say to just use those settings :p
[13:52:07] <ajpiano> man you guys i have so many repos to delete now that i have more access in the jquery org
[13:58:06] <DaveMethvin> go ahead, make my day!
[13:58:20] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/pull/72 shall I merge this one?
[14:02:06] <gnarf> ajpiano: it should update on push to web-events/master now
[14:02:19] <ajpiano> rad i'll test it out double quick
[14:04:32] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: landed
[14:04:36] <ryanneufeld> cool
[14:06:43] <ajpiano> gnarf: confirm!
[14:06:45] <ajpiano> thanks man
[14:06:52] <ajpiano> i''ll let you know when we can pull the trigger
[14:10:31] <ajpiano> gnarf: also if you have any thoughts on the site having looked at it cursorily, let me know
[14:10:53] <gnarf> ajpiano: other than making sure the url loaded, i didn't even read it yet, will do that now ;)
[14:11:40] <ryanneufeld> events.jquery.org
[14:11:41] <ryanneufeld> ?
[14:12:00] <ryanneufeld> seems to load the SF 2012 details...
[14:12:09] <ajpiano> it's still supposed to :p
[14:12:16] <ryanneufeld> Then it looks fantastic
[14:12:22] <gnarf> ajpiano: flowing coffee (and soda?)
[14:12:40] <gnarf> beverages
[14:12:43] <gnarf> *shrug*
[14:12:58] <gnarf> I'd hate to offend someone who doesn't like coffee :)
[14:13:24] <ajpiano> haha
[14:13:28] <ajpiano> FLOWING BEVERAGES
