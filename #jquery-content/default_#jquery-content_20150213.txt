[05:05:25] <agcolom> I got a deploy error
[05:05:52] <agcolom> I'm not sure what I did wrong as I did exactly the same as usual and it all worked locally
[05:06:03] <arschmitz> agcolom: its broken 
[05:06:12] <agcolom> Did I break it?
[05:06:16] <arschmitz> now
[05:06:17] <arschmitz> no
[05:06:41] <arschmitz> agcolom: gnarf s5fs were moving some stuff last night and i was helping and we uh did a bad job testing after :(
[05:06:48] <agcolom> ok
[05:06:57] <agcolom> Is there anything I need to do?
[05:07:04] <arschmitz> agcolom: no
[05:07:08] <agcolom> ok :-)
[05:07:12] <arschmitz> gnarf: or s5fs need to fix it
[05:07:27] <arschmitz> but for now nothing can deploy to master
[05:07:33] <arschmitz> to production i mean
[05:07:33] <agcolom> ok. 
[05:07:48] <agcolom> I was worried I had broken everything!
[05:07:57] <agcolom> So i'll wait for the mobile notes
[05:07:59] <arschmitz> agcolom: nope 
[05:08:19] <arschmitz> agcolom: right now everything is just going to stage

[07:17:25] <gnarf> agcolom: i know how it broke
[07:17:35] <gnarf> agcolom: you pushed 2 commits so close to each other
[07:17:40] <agcolom> oh
[07:17:42] <agcolom> :-(
[07:17:44] <agcolom> sorry
[07:17:47] <gnarf> and for some reason, it seems to need to push updates for EVERY post 
[07:17:54] <gnarf> it wouldn't of updated the "live" server anyway
[07:17:58] <gnarf> because i fucked it up
[07:18:04] <gnarf> so no worries :)
[07:18:09] <agcolom> :-)
[07:18:16] <agcolom> do I need to do anything?
[07:19:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can you look into why the grunt deploy on meetings.jquery.org seems to need to push every post every commit?
[07:20:23] <gnarf> agcolom: nope, im doing a manual deploy of the stuff you pushed
[07:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: That doesn't happen for me.
[07:21:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: look in the deploy emails
[07:21:12] <scott_gonzalez> It may think every post changes when you moved servers though.
[07:21:39] <gnarf> oh
[07:21:48] <gnarf> ill test again right after this
[07:22:04] <gnarf> only up to 2013 right now :)
[07:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's because of this: https://github.com/jquery/meetings.jquery.org/blob/master/Gruntfile.js#L40
[07:23:01] <scott_gonzalez> We generate actual dates for the posts.
[07:23:15] <gnarf> oh timezone
[07:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> And since JS has shitty date handling, we're always using local time.
[07:23:59] <gnarf> is it possible to detect no diff in the actual content though and not need to sync?
[07:24:15] <scott_gonzalez> no, because metadata is important.
[07:24:18] <gnarf> ok
[07:24:43] <scott_gonzalez> It should only do the full deploy once.
[07:24:43] <gnarf> seems good now
[07:24:49] <gnarf> correct
[07:25:39] <agcolom> btw someone told me yesterday that 3 days ago they received the last 10 blog posts again on the jquery mobile blog rss feed
[07:25:46] <agcolom> Could that be related?
[07:32:44] <gnarf> dont think so, rss breaks like that all the time though :)
