[07:30:08] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is there a saner way to do a manual upgrade other than manually copying lots of files like wp-config.php, wp-content/uploads, etc.
[07:30:54] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: you talking about the blog?
[07:30:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:31:07] <nacin> sure. don't have all of those inside the WP folder. :-)
[07:31:23] <nacin> if I can be given access to wherever the blog is I can just upgrade it.
[07:31:41] <scott_gonzalez> Try to ssh to blog.jquery.com
[07:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> It's an eol server, so I'm not sure if you have access, but I *think* it's configured for the same users as every other server.
[07:33:22] <nacin> well, that was easy
[07:33:23] <nacin> var/www?
[07:33:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the current blog is in htdocs
[07:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> wordpress.zip is a fresh download.
[07:33:55] <scott_gonzalez>  /var/www/blog.jquery.com/htdocs
[07:33:58] <nacin> yep
[07:34:36] <nacin> I'm gonna just do this quickly
[07:34:48] <nacin> have you considered just pushing the button in the admin?
[07:34:50] <nacin> just as affective
[07:35:19] <scott_gonzalez> I tried that when I was upgrading the UI blog, but it was asking for FTP credentials.
[07:35:25] <nacin> ah, yeah
[07:35:27] <nacin> file permissions
[07:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see what happens with this one.
[07:35:38] <nacin> file permissions seem fine for thiso ne
[07:35:50] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this one worked.
[07:35:50] <nacin> everything is owned by www-data
[07:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> I assumed that since the other blog didn't work this one wouldn't either.
[07:36:05] <nacin> poof, done
[07:36:09] <scott_gonzalez> Silly assumption for anything on an eol server :-P
[07:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> Well that was easy.
[07:36:53] <nacin> I can turn on auto updates here
[07:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> Any chance you have time to look at the auto update problem for jquery-wp-content?
[07:38:21] <nacin> am going to look now
[07:39:04] <nacin> now that 3.9 is out :-)
[07:39:09] <nacin> I can do other things again
[07:39:12] <nacin> like sleeping and eating
[07:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:39:55] <nacin> okay, blog will auto-update
[07:40:36] <nacin> I don't see background-update-tester installed, was it removed?
[07:41:27] <nacin> oh, I see it in mu-plugins
[07:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:43:05] <nacin> ha, I don't have a user account
[07:45:46] <nacin> okay, I disabled DISALLOW_FILE_MODS temporarily
[07:45:57] <nacin> which gives us FAIL: Your installation of WordPress prompts for FTP credentials to perform updates.
[07:46:43] <nacin> I see everything as nobody:
[07:47:14] <nacin> looks like www-data is the owner if we want file updates
[07:47:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, though lots of files are owned by root.
[07:47:42] <nacin> not in wordpress/wordpress
[07:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right. I was looking at jquery-wp-content.
[07:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm guessing we can chown it to www-data.
[07:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs gnarf: ^
[07:48:33] <nacin> we can
[07:48:39] <nacin> it's also reversible, evetything is nobody:nogroup here
[07:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:49:10] <scott_gonzalez> done
[07:49:28] <nacin> ha, I was about to
[07:50:02] <nacin> still seeing the failure, so gonna debug
[07:50:45] <nacin> oh, we missed the folder itself
[07:50:58] <nacin> everything passes
[07:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> fixed
[07:51:11] <scott_gonzalez> yay
[07:51:40] <scott_gonzalez> So this should just start working now, right?
[07:51:51] <nacin> yeah. right now I have DISALLOW_FILE_MODS commented out
[07:52:02] <nacin> which means the super admin will see update nags and could actually one-click update
[07:52:06] <nacin> which I think is fine, as no one is doing that
[07:52:12] <nacin> vaultpress is out of date
[07:52:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I saw that VaultPress message.
[07:52:23] <nacin> is that something checked in?
[07:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:53:06] <nacin> gonna turn on auto-updates here
[07:53:35] <scott_gonzalez> Can you do that through jquery-wp-content?
[07:53:40] <nacin> I will
[07:53:48] <nacin> it's actually in wp-config.php and I think it probably belongs there
[07:53:57] <nacin> you don't want a staging site updating
[07:54:34] <nacin> oh, it's already enabled in config.php
[07:54:41] <nacin> by you
[07:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> hmm... http://api.jquery.com/category/all/
[07:55:00] <nacin> how to modify the puppet config?
[07:55:04] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I thought you meant auto updates for VaultPress (well, plugins in general)
[07:55:15] <nacin> nah, it's versioned so would rather not
[07:55:16] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure. I don't do anything with puppet.
[07:55:45] <nacin> okay. if gnarf removes define('DISALLOW_FILE_MODS', true); (and associated code comment) from puppet, you're all set.
[07:56:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I found the relevant file for puppet.
[07:57:46] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks for the help.
[07:58:06] <nacin> of course.
[07:58:08] <nacin> sorry that took a bit.
[07:58:37] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Do you know why /category/all is broken?
[07:58:41] <nacin> looking
[07:58:42] <scott_gonzalez> The update was supposed to fix it.
[07:58:49] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps another regression?
[07:58:52] <nacin> it didn't update yet
[07:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> oh
[08:00:27] <nacin> it's scheduled for Fri, 18 Apr 2014 21:01:00 +0200 at the moment
[08:00:37] <nacin> 7pm GMT
[08:00:52] <nacin> 3pm eastern
[08:01:01] <nacin> I'll move it up to right now
[08:01:30] <nacin> the notification will go to infrastructure@, do you get that?
[08:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> I think so.
[08:03:12] <nacin> it's set for 90 seconds from now
[08:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> great
[08:04:42] <nacin> puppet blocked it
[08:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[08:05:13] <nacin> commented the line out again and re-scheduling
[08:05:23] <scott_gonzalez> s5fs gnarf ryanneufeld: Can someone just confirm that I can commit this to puppet-master: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/pull/263/files
[08:06:46] <nacin> scheduled for 45 seconds from now
[08:07:57] <nacin> update failed, whee

[08:32:04] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: core still thinks FTP is required; I know why but I am trying to figure out if it is a bad assumption in core
[08:32:14] <nacin> I think the tester plugin is actually making the bad assumption
[08:32:46] <scott_gonzalez> Screw it, we'll just switch to Drupal.
[08:32:51] <nacin> :-)
[08:33:10] <nacin> quick, get ajpiano
[08:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> haha
