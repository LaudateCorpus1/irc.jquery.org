[06:26:26] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #333 by agcolom (1w 1d ago): Starting code example cleanup process
[06:27:28] <kswedberg_> scott_gonzalez (and agcolom):  awesome! thanks so much.
[06:27:47] <kswedberg_> ready to merge?
[06:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> We actually need to do a full run through because we changed the template.
[06:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> We can merge in pieces and the site won't break.
[06:33:47] <scott_gonzalez> The only negative impact should be the closing style tag being in the wrong place for entries we haven't touched yet.
[06:33:57] <scott_gonzalez> So if you're fine with that, we can merge as we go.
[06:34:45] <agcolom_> I'm thinking it might be best to merge at the end as the style might look different... but up to you....
[06:34:45] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg_: Here's an example of what I'm referring to: http://cl.ly/image/16191W1u0s0U
[06:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> Compare that to: http://cl.ly/image/0g1b1y2Q1h3K
[06:35:14] <kswedberg_> if that's the only thing it does to the entries not changed yet, I think we can live with it. maybe it'll provide motivation to get the rest done more quickly.
[06:35:14] <kswedberg_> I should be able to help out with that, too.
[06:35:14] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:35:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to squash these commits and merge to master.
[06:35:17] <agcolom_> Can I just commit one missing one in css now?
[06:35:17] <kswedberg_> scott_gonzalez: sounds great. thx. have you documented how code blocks and examples should look?
[06:35:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's just the normal jQuery style guide.
[06:35:22] <kswedberg_> I mean, I can figure it out by looking at the committed files, but it might be nice to have it documented somewhere
[06:35:22] <kswedberg_> ok.
[06:35:35] <kswedberg_> but where you put <pre><code> and subsequent lines of code, etc.
[06:35:39] <scott_gonzalez> But for <pre><code> blocks, we keep the <pre><code> and </code></pre> where they should go in terms of indentation.
[06:35:47] <scott_gonzalez> And then the actual code inside them starts flush left.
[06:36:09] <scott_gonzalez> Since it gets parsed by the syntax highlighter.
[06:36:32] <scott_gonzalez> For examples, everything is flush left, except for styles, which are indented one level.
[06:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> That's the only annoying part.
[06:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> Since in the template the <style> is indented one level, the actual code has to be indented one level.
[06:36:56] <kswedberg_> ok.
[06:36:58] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you know some way to indent every line in XSLT :-P
[06:37:11] <kswedberg_> nope! I know nothing!
[06:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> haha

[06:37:46] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom_: Go ahead and push whatever change you have for css.
[06:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> I'll wait for that before squashing.
[06:37:53] <agcolom_> scott_gonzalez: done
[06:39:30] <agcolom_> and then, do we need to create another branch or do we keep the cleanup branch?
[06:49:06] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need a new branch from master. These commits will essentially die when I squash them.
[06:49:15] <agcolom_> ok.

[14:26:34] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Pull request #49 by scottgonzalez (6m 31s ago): JS Style Guide: More rules and clarifications.
[14:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> Comments directly on commits will only show up in the discussion tab, not in the compare (files changed) tab.
[14:27:07] <scott_gonzalez> Which makes it really hard to track what has been fixed.
[14:28:46] <agcolom> ok
[14:28:57] <agcolom> Sorry
[14:29:21] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[14:29:33] <scott_gonzalez> Now you know :-)
[14:29:37] <agcolom> so here: https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/49/files
[14:29:39] <agcolom> line 210
[14:30:00] <agcolom> there looks like there is an extra indentation in front of the .html
[14:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> There is.
[14:30:07] <agcolom> (hence my question :-) )
[14:30:09] <scott_gonzalez> I responded to your comment.
[14:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> .html() isn't what causes the indentation though.
[14:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> .children() causes the indentation.
[14:30:36] <agcolom> oh!
[14:30:42] <agcolom> any others would do that?
[14:30:48] <scott_gonzalez> A lot of others.
[14:30:52] <agcolom> parent?
[14:30:52] <scott_gonzalez> Anything that changes the context.
[14:31:04] <agcolom> can we have a list?
[14:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> parent, parents, siblings, next, prev, nextAll, prevAll, find, closest, filter, add, etc.
[14:31:16] <scott_gonzalez> no
[14:31:54] <agcolom> how do I find out ?
[14:32:09] <scott_gonzalez> You should just know what the code you're writing does :-P
[14:32:34] <agcolom> I knew you were going to say that :-P
[14:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> If the method changes which elements are in the jQuery object, then the following lines need to be indented.
[14:32:40] <agcolom> (stupid me ;-) )
[14:33:07] <agcolom> ok, so end() stops that and we're back up one level 
[14:33:12] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[14:33:17] <agcolom> any other can do that?
[14:33:50] <scott_gonzalez> Do what? Undo the context change?
[14:34:02] <agcolom> yes
[14:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> no
[14:34:14] <agcolom> that's easy :-)
[14:34:19] <agcolom> ok, last question:
[14:35:09] <agcolom> var a, b, c,
[14:35:09] <agcolom>     foo = true,
[14:35:09] <agcolom>     bar = false;
[14:35:24] <agcolom> where does the second line go?
[14:35:36] <agcolom> (indented one level or foo is aligned with a?
[14:35:46] <scott_gonzalez> Indented one level.
[14:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing is ever aligned.
[14:36:37] <agcolom> ok. it's just that it is an unfortunate coincidence but on http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/ the indentation is 4 spaces so they end up aligned...
[14:37:00] <scott_gonzalez> The first rule of spacing is "Indentation with tabs."
[14:37:01] <agcolom> so that's why I was aligning them...
[14:37:18] <agcolom> true
[14:37:54] <agcolom> Thanks for all these additions in the guide :-)
[14:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
