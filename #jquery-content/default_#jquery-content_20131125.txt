[12:58:04] <tj_vantoll> arxwn: Datepicker has no events.

[12:58:57] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/061-4 14d543318 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: slider: converted the example from xhtml to html
[12:58:59] <arxwn> the onSelect is not event?
[12:59:13] <arxwn> its option as i can see
[12:59:17] <arxwn> lol
[12:59:35] <arxwn> it should be event i think
[13:01:07] <scott_gonzalez> arxwn: It shouldn't be an event, because it's just a callback.
[13:01:11] <scott_gonzalez> There is no actual event associated with it.
[13:01:18] <scott_gonzalez> Which is different from every other widget.
[13:01:58] <arxwn> ok understood
[13:02:59] <arxwn> thanks
[13:03:43] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[13:03:51] <arxwn> Can I ask something else? I think the old jquery ui web site was better more practical
[13:04:09] <scott_gonzalez> That doesn't sound like a question :-P
[13:04:10] <arxwn> now all the events methods are in big list
[13:04:21] <arxwn> and i have to scroll down all th etime
[13:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> They were in the old docs too.
[13:04:31] <arxwn> is it possible to change oit spomehow?
[13:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> Change what?
[13:05:00] <arxwn> that big in height page where i have to scroll
[13:05:01] <arxwn> down
[13:05:08] <arxwn> and then scroll up again to 
[13:05:15] <arxwn> to find another method
[13:05:22] <arxwn> all the time up and down
[13:05:29] <arxwn> its not practical
[13:05:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what you want instead.
[13:05:57] <tj_vantoll> arxwn: Do you mean fixed navigation?
[13:06:01] <scott_gonzalez> Everything is in alphabetical order, and scrolling to the top in every browser I've ever used is extremely simple.
[13:06:17] <tj_vantoll> Something like http://backbonejs.org/?
[13:06:46] <arxwn> yeah like backbone would be great
[13:06:54] <arxwn> on the left the widgets
[13:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> Except that Backbone's API is super tiny.
[13:07:06] <arxwn> and all th emethods etc to clik on
[13:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> Compared to projects like jQuery and jQuery UI.
[13:07:41] <arxwn> I remember the old before migrating to wordpress
[13:07:49] <arxwn> and i think it was more practicla
[13:07:54] <arxwn> i could find things easier
[13:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> There was actually nothing that made navigating easier in the old docs.
[13:08:43] <arxwn> What i will be happy with is to add the api below the demo
[13:08:52] <arxwn> so i can eiasily find
[13:08:55] <arxwn> directly
[13:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand how that helps.
[13:09:01] <arxwn> with a 2 tab
[13:09:11] <arxwn> methods|option|events
[13:09:21] <tj_vantoll> Personally, I prefer Backbone's fixed navigation but I don't have a practical suggestion for how to implement it with a bigger API.
[13:09:21] <scott_gonzalez> You're complaining that you need to scroll to the top, but putting this below the demo would just make you scroll to the bottom.
[13:09:21] <arxwn> I am located in an example
[13:09:32] <arxwn> why to change the page and go to other to see the api
[13:09:38] <arxwn> iwant them all directrly
[13:09:45] <tj_vantoll> Ah you want those links on jqueryui.com directly.
[13:09:58] <arxwn> that would help
[13:09:59] <arxwn> a lot
[13:10:14] <arxwn> i a tab system
[13:10:19] <arxwn> yeah
[13:10:23] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, those are two different sites. This separation actually existed in the old site as well.
[13:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> But we copied the API to the demos site.
[13:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> We don't do that anymore.
[13:11:14] <arxwn> hm yes i can see
[13:11:30] <arxwn> api is in subdomain
[13:12:02] <tj_vantoll> This is a common complaint but we don't have a good means of making this more intuitive and maintainable (yet).
[13:13:00] <tj_vantoll> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/115
[13:13:06] <tj_vantoll> Feedback welcome :)
[13:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> arxwn: Yeah, we'd really like concrete examples of things that can be improved.
[13:16:10] <scott_gonzalez> We know that switching between the demos and docs is a pain point.
[13:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> But we haven't found a good solution.
[13:16:26] <scott_gonzalez> And generally the feedback we get is very vague.
[13:16:27] <arxwn> hmm
[13:16:34] <arxwn> not even with i frame?
[13:16:43] <arxwn> below examples
[13:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be a pretty terrible user experience.
[13:17:13] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think you want an iframe of the contents.
[13:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> If you did, you'd just open the API docs in another tab.
