[16:39:42] <EhsanKia> Hello, just wanted to let you know that the jQuery 1.4 documentation site links to jquery14.com which seems to be now owned by some russian scam site.
[16:39:43] <EhsanKia> https://api.jquery.com/category/version/1.4/
[16:42:53] <EhsanKia> Went ahead and checked all the other release page, the only other one that also has this issue is 14.1 https://api.jquery.com/category/version/1.4.1/
[16:46:22] <EhsanKia> Found this issue https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/843
