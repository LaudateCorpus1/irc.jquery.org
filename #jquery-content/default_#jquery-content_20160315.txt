[14:45:25] <django_> agcolom, hey
[15:17:09] <agcolom> hi django_
[15:17:28] <django_> agcolom, is there a list of projects that have been funded for gsoc 2016 now?
[15:18:03] <agcolom> no, we find this out later I think. Let me check the schedule...
[15:20:42] <agcolom> we find out how many slots we get after proposal are made
[15:21:22] <agcolom> the number of proposals we get is apparently a determining factor for how many slots we get (together with our experience with the programme, etc)
[15:50:13] <django_> ahh
[15:50:27] <django_> i graduate this semester from college, does that mean i cant do gsoc 2016?
