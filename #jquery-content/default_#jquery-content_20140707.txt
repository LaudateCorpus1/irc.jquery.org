[11:16:25] <johngrogg> Hi all, I published a new jQuery plugin, and somehow the registry created 2 pages for it (one of which isn't actually tracking new versions)
[11:16:31] <johngrogg> anyone have any idea what could cause that?
[11:36:16] <scott_gonzalez> The -2 is generated by WordPress either because of a collision or a race condition. But I don't know what the underlying cause would have been.
