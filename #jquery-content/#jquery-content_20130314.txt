[09:16:09] <jzaefferer> rworth: I just deployed jquery.org locally. What's the status there? I see a few issues on the homepage alone, but don't want to bother with known issues
[09:16:38] <rworth> dmethvin and I just did a walkthrough
[09:16:49] <rworth> he wrote some copy for the homepage, I'm putting it in
[09:16:54] <rworth> he's gonna update the history page
[09:17:50] <rworth> need to copy members and sponsors pages from live site, removing members from sponsors page (they were only listed there before members page existed)
[09:18:19] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:18:33] <jzaefferer> ping me when there's an update and I can do some testing/review
[09:18:37] <rworth> I'm working on adding coupon code support to join/stripe, which is the last piece for that
[09:18:41] <rworth> ok, thanks jzaefferer 
[09:18:45] <jzaefferer> I really want to see this online :-)
[09:18:49] <rworth> me too
[09:18:51] <rworth> :D
[09:19:19] <rworth> dmethvin and I are gonna touch base again tomorrow am (he'll do some tonight), hopefully we can get it up
[09:19:36] <rworth> also waiting on ryanneufeld 's help in #jquery-infrastructure so we can actually stage it again
[09:20:55] <ryanneufeld> I'm not exactly sure what has to be changed

[10:21:30] <scott_gonzalez> But it looked like some of the existing blog posts had broken markup.
[10:21:37] <scott_gonzalez> Which was wreaking havoc on our templates.
[10:21:42] <scott_gonzalez> Like extra closing </div>
[10:21:43] <rworth> can you give him what info he needs in #infra to configure the stripe key(s) for testing
[10:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: sure
[10:22:07] <rworth> oh yeah, that'll be a fund part of the mega-consolidation
[10:22:10] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: how many problematic ones are there :/

[10:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I didn't do much digging.
[10:22:39] <ajpiano> ok
[10:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> I was just like "oh shit, everything is horribly broken, what did I do?!?"
[10:23:15] <scott_gonzalez> And then I realized it was from a post.
[10:23:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's possible that it's just one bad post, but I didn't want to spend much time on it.

[11:02:31] <ajpiano> alright, well, back to the real world for me
[11:02:55] <kswedberg> whta's that?
[11:04:07] <ajpiano> a show on MTV, i'm marathoning obvi
[11:04:17] <kswedberg> :)_
[12:19:09] <DaveMethvin> anyone who can help with an install of jquery-wp-content et al?
[12:19:16] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano or kswedberg?
[12:23:29] <kswedberg> hi DaveMethvin 
[12:23:35] <DaveMethvin> hey
[12:23:50] <DaveMethvin> so i'm at step 4 and it says "fill in your database credentials"
[12:23:52] <kswedberg> is this what we were working on the other day that didn't go so well?
[12:23:58] <kswedberg> ok.
[12:24:00] <DaveMethvin> well kinda related
[12:24:07] <DaveMethvin> so what info shoudl I put there?
[12:24:12] <DaveMethvin> do i need to create a user?
[12:24:23] <DaveMethvin> a mysql user that is
[12:24:31] <kswedberg> create a new database 
[12:24:34] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content
[12:24:38] <kswedberg> you can use an existing user.
[12:25:06] <kswedberg> this is going to point to a local mysql db, yeah?
[12:25:10] <DaveMethvin> yes
[12:25:24] <kswedberg> do you already have mysql set up locally? with a user?
[12:25:37] <DaveMethvin> so it just wasnt' clear to me what to put there
[12:25:50] <DaveMethvin> it didn't say to create a user or what perms to give it etc
[12:25:55] <kswedberg> is it clearer now?
[12:26:00] <DaveMethvin> i assume the wp install creates the tables
[12:26:06] <kswedberg> yes
[12:26:07] <DaveMethvin> well, uh, i guess i create a user
[12:26:33] <kswedberg> typically you have a default user already. like "root" or "admin" or "dmethvin" or some such.
[12:26:49] <DaveMethvin> oh sure i have root
[12:26:56] <DaveMethvin> but i didn't figure i'd be using that one
[12:27:50] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll create a user
[12:27:56] <kswedberg> oh. why not? I do.
[12:28:09] <DaveMethvin> ok i'll just use root
[12:28:20] <DaveMethvin> i figured there might be a prob with it
[12:29:08] <kswedberg> well there "might" be a problem with lots of things. you're on windows, right? ;-)
[12:29:25] <DaveMethvin> yeah ... right now it's hanging when i go to local.jquery.com
[12:29:33] <DaveMethvin> i can see that it redirects properly
[12:29:39] <DaveMethvin> and localhost works
[12:29:53] <DaveMethvin> and there are no errors in the apache err log
[12:30:08] <DaveMethvin> it just never responds
[12:30:46] <DaveMethvin> ping shows that local.jquery.com is being correctly translated to 127.0.0.1
[12:30:52] <kswedberg> hmm. and you followed steps 5-8, too?
[12:31:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah, set the .htaccess and set up the vhost
[12:31:48] <DaveMethvin> had to double check all the names since they assume /jquery
[12:31:53] <DaveMethvin> i have jquery core there
[12:31:58] <DaveMethvin> so i renamed to wp-jquery
[12:32:36] <kswedberg> do you have the jquery.com repo?
[12:33:31] <DaveMethvin> yes but not nested under wp-jquery
[12:33:40] <DaveMethvin> that is i've cloned it before
[12:33:41] <kswedberg> it doesn't have to be. 
[12:33:59] <kswedberg> ok, when you go to that dir, do you have a config.json file?
[12:34:27] <DaveMethvin> so what jquery repos need to be here to set up wordpress? just jquery-wp-content right?
[12:35:16] <kswedberg> I guess so. not sure. but you need to have the content repo to see the content.
[12:35:59] <DaveMethvin> i haven't configured my jquery.com repo yet
[12:36:03] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez is better at this than I am. I did this once. He (and nacin) set it up.
[12:36:18] <kswedberg> well, maybe that would help.
[12:36:28] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yeah, just jquery-wp-content.
[12:36:31] <DaveMethvin> if it does i think this is missing a step or two
[12:36:35] <DaveMethvin> ok good
[12:36:42] <scott_gonzalez> Follow the instructions in the readme. If you have problems, let me know and we'll get the readme updated based on what fails.
[12:37:00] <DaveMethvin> well i got to step 7 and i can't get to local.jquery.com
[12:37:00] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: he did follow the instructions. and he's stuck.
[12:37:26] <DaveMethvin> just for safety's sake i'll restart all the services
[12:37:35] <DaveMethvin> i did restarts at various points
[12:37:54] <DaveMethvin> nope
[12:38:02] <scott_gonzalez> What happens when you go to local.jquery.com?
[12:38:11] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, that should just resolve to 127.0.0.1
[12:38:12] <DaveMethvin> it's hitting my local server (ping shows that) but it just hangs forever
[12:38:17] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> What server are you using? Apache?
[12:38:44] <DaveMethvin> yep
[12:38:52] <DaveMethvin> copy/pasted most of the setup there
[12:39:05] <DaveMethvin> except i had to rename to wp-jquery since i have /jquery for the core repo
[12:39:31] <DaveMethvin> but i also renamed them in the vhost
[12:39:58] <DaveMethvin> so local.jquery.com finally responded, i'm at the top-level localhost
[12:40:06] <DaveMethvin> but i don't think i should be there?
[12:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, Apache should see the hostname and choose the appropriate directory to serve from.
[12:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> So you do want to be at the root.
[12:41:10] <DaveMethvin> ah, finally got an error  Invalid command 'RewriteEngine'
[12:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...no mod_rewrite?
[12:41:41] <kswedberg> there you go. 
[12:42:03] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: do you need to enable that manually?
[12:42:06] <DaveMethvin> needs to be enabled, let me check
[12:42:30] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, if I'm slow to respond, just ping me. I'm in the middle of a UI release :-P
[12:43:23] <DaveMethvin> ok, enabling and restarting
[12:45:57] <DaveMethvin> nope, still goes to localhost root rather than /wp-jquery root
[12:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Screen share on Skype?
[12:58:44] <DaveMethvin> sure
