[05:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Gradients look better, but I still think the border seems out of place.

[10:16:01] <agcolom> DaveMethvin: Hello and happy New Year :-) I've just read your document on The State of jQuery 2013
[10:16:41] <DaveMethvin> please do add any comments or edits you'd like agcolom
[10:17:15] <agcolom> I was wondering whether 'oldIE' was meant to be 'old IE'?
[10:17:39] <agcolom> (Maybe oldIE is fine, but just wanted to check with you)
[10:17:44] <DaveMethvin> i tend to use it as oldIE but i guess that's not really a word :)
[10:18:02] <agcolom> well, it's easy enough to understand ;-)
[10:18:54] <agcolom> I think it'd be good to put up a page as you mentioned on how to become a sponsor/sponsor employees, etc...
[10:19:18] <DaveMethvin> there should be a page up within a week with a paypal link etc
[10:21:53] <agcolom> also, it'd may be a good idea to double check the team members list... (I'm not sure Maurice G is still a mobile member for example...) Maybe we should get team leaders to have a look?
[10:22:26] <agcolom> and that's it :-) I like your document :-)
[10:22:32] <DaveMethvin> if there's someone you think should see it that isn't on the list, you can send them a link
[10:22:41] <DaveMethvin> its not public yet, of course
[10:22:54] <DaveMethvin> but a few more people would be good for review
[10:23:47] <agcolom> I'll get todd to double check the mobile team members maybe?
[10:23:57] <DaveMethvin> sure, thanks!

[11:50:08] <scott_gonzalez> I think I have blog.jqueryui.com updated.
[11:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> Of course that means that I'll need to replay any new commits that change the apperance.
[17:50:43] <ajpiano> hmm no jqcommit
