[14:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do we listen for any github web hook events other than push for any of our services?
[14:34:44] <scott_gonzalez> I think I'm going to change node-git-notifier to support every event type.
[14:41:45] <gnarf> please do - even if we did listen i don't think we will get a branch/master event from a different one will we?
[14:42:37] <gnarf> I don't think any of them are setup to listen to other things, but it might make some sense to do a .on("jquery/jquery.com/wiki")  ?
[14:45:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we'll be able to listen for that (gollum, not wiki) after the update.
[14:46:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to change it to be "{user}/{repo}/{event-type}" and then the push events will get the extra levels.
[14:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> So you'd have things like "jquery/jquery.com/push/heads/master" (notice the introduction of push)
[14:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm debating whether I should just emit two events for push to keep back compat.
[14:47:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm also thinking about emitting two forms of the events, so that you can listen based on the event type.
[14:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> For example: ":push/jquery/jquery.com" (note the leading colon) and "jquery/jquery.com/push" would be the same
[14:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> Damn smileys always screwing things up...
[14:48:53] <scott_gonzalez> That would let you do: ":gollum/**" to listen to wiki updates for any repo.
