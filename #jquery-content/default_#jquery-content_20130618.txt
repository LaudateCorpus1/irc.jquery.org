[07:30:17] <ajpiano> so uh, how *do* we delete plugins from the plugin site cc rworth gnarf
[07:30:30] <ajpiano> i know scott_gonzalez is out this week, can we avoid having to wait for him to return
[07:46:54] <gnarf> ajpiano: I'm pretty sure we could figure it out, but I don't know that I have the time to do that
[07:47:14] <ajpiano> hmm
[07:47:19] <ajpiano> that person did a realy scummy thing :/
[07:47:22] <gnarf> What I kind of want to see is a command line tool for doing database stuff like this
[07:47:30] <gnarf> what person?
[07:47:59] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/138
[07:48:28] <rworth> the only such script scott_gonzalez has created so far is bin/transfer.sh
[07:48:31] <rworth> er .js
[07:48:46] <ajpiano> the creators of www.visuallightbox.com
[07:48:53] <ajpiano> created a separate repo for each demo
[07:48:58] <ajpiano> and added like 20 plugins
[07:49:04] <ajpiano> all version 5.4.17 of their lightbox
[07:49:19] <gnarf> ajpiano: cc s5fs
[07:55:09] <gnarf> ajpiano: there are too many compoents I don't feel I have mastery of in the wordpress stuff
[07:55:17] <gnarf> though - I think I could figure something out
[07:55:56] <gnarf> can we wait til next week for scott_gonzalez, or should I spend the time to get it done today
[07:59:05] <ajpiano> i mean, i would rather not break something else
[07:59:18] <ajpiano> i wish we could just sink them off the front page
