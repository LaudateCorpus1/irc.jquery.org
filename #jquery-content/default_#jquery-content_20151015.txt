[16:44:10] <agcolom> gnarf: I'm getting a 409 for the image top right for your sites. It is because of the network I'm on or is something broken?
[16:44:25] <gnarf> ?
[16:44:32] <agcolom> http://jquery.com
[16:44:58] <gnarf> agcolom: the ad space?
[16:45:00] <agcolom> If I go to the image it should show it says the server responds with a conflict
[16:45:02] <agcolom> yes
[16:45:27] <agcolom> I was wondering whether it was the network...
[16:45:34] <agcolom> that I'm accessing it from
[16:45:46] <agcolom> are you seeing the image ok?
[16:45:52] <gnarf> no
[16:45:53] <gnarf> http://static.adzerk.net/Advertisers/bf6a160cde9746c890285a40334fe6c2.jpg
[16:46:04] <agcolom> that is the only one that works for me
[16:46:23] <agcolom> http://static.adzerk.net/Advertisers/d3d295b40f004a5e9fd9cb0899a9afdb.png
[16:46:31] <gnarf> looks like something is wrong with adzerk?
[16:46:43] <gnarf> I don't even know where to configure that or if I have a login
[16:46:45] <gnarf> will ping kborchers 
[16:47:08] <agcolom> oh wow! I'm getting Error 1001! that's new!
[16:47:16] <agcolom> yes, it must be them then...
[16:47:28] <agcolom> DNS resolution error
[16:49:24] <agcolom> right, that css conf image no longer works either
[16:49:30] <agcolom> So that's definitely not us
