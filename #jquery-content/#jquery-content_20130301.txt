[07:29:45] <hemanth_> __ __ rather than ## is needed, right?

[09:05:27] <b-ot> Krinkle: Timo Tijhof (1m 3s ago): Prefer HTTPS and shorter urls  ..but only when not taking extra redirects or invalid certificates.  In other words:    "Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler."  * Google has proper HTTPS on www and non-www.   On both www/non-www, /chrome redirects to a localised version at   https://www.google.com/intl/LANG/chrome/browser   This url without www is a 404 error.  * Firefox has proper HTTPS on www and non-www.  
[09:05:42] <Krinkle> fuckers, getting it right is hard uh ?
[09:05:53] <Krinkle> what a mess
[09:06:05] <Krinkle> Opera and Apple handle it best.
[09:06:14] <Krinkle> well, almost.
[09:06:22] <nacin> geez.
[09:06:50] <Krinkle> 2 minutes in I was like, okay, nevermind, I'll go mind something else.
[09:06:55] <Krinkle> but I wanted to see how crazy it really was.
[09:08:50] <Krinkle> nacin: If you're testing the urls, be sure to do it in Incognito if you're using HTTPS Everywhere, to avoid it fixing it for you.
