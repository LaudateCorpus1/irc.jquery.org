[09:18:28] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: are we actually using adzerk? and if so, is it serving ads on a location-specific basis
[09:19:05] <scott_gonzalez> yes and yes
[09:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> The only time we used location info was for the Russian conf.
[09:19:23] <ajpiano> ah nm. i am on call w/ someone who wasn't seeing them. and she is using adblock
[09:19:29] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:19:46] <ajpiano> how do i go about adding new ads to adzerk
[09:20:17] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy. That requires a Skype call and at least 15 minutes.
[09:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> I can show you after the UI meeting.
