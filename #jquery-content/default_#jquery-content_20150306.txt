[08:31:37] <bePolite> Hello
[08:32:19] <arthurvr> bePolite: Hi!
[08:33:27] <bePolite> I would like to talk abut https://github.com/jquery/content/issues/4
[08:33:52] <arthurvr> bePolite: You can ask any question you have :)
[08:35:09] <bePolite> Sorry that was an honest mistake
[08:35:23] <bePolite> I'm here regarding this GSOC project " jQuery Learning Center - Interactive tutorials for learn and other sites "
[08:35:41] <arthurvr> bePolite: Same thing, feel free to ask anything :)
[08:36:10] <bePolite> arthurvr: So the project is about building something like http://www.codecademy.com/ for jquery?
[08:37:03] <bePolite> Will the project involve creating a complete web app?
[08:37:59] <bePolite> What about the video tutorials
[08:38:08] <bePolite> How will those be done?
[08:39:21] <arthurvr> bePolite: Yeah something like that. We still have to figure out most of it ourselves :)
[08:39:46] <arthurvr> anyways gotta leave but other people are able to answer you for sure. cc agcolom arschmitz
[08:40:18] <arschmitz> Hi catching upo
[08:40:33] <bePolite> arschmitz: arthurvr I'll like to have more info on that issue.
[08:41:19] <arschmitz> bePolite: there is not a ton of info to give
[08:41:28] <arschmitz> we dont have specific requirements yet
[08:41:54] <arschmitz> we are working on jsbin integration on some other tasks so it MAY make sense to combine some efforts there or it may not hard to say
[08:43:25] <bePolite> well It will be quite difficult to work on the project if the requirements are blury?
[08:44:40] <arschmitz> bePolite: part of the project will be developing the requirments
[08:44:45] <arschmitz> with the team
[08:46:59] <bePolite> Okay then It may be nice for us to create a github issue for this project so we can discuss there in a structured way?
[08:47:30] <bePolite> How do you suggest we develop the requirements?
[08:48:16] <arschmitz> an issue would be good
[08:48:53] <bePolite> Okay I'll come up with some suggestions. Should I go ahead and create the github issue now?
[08:51:28] <bePolite> arschmitz: Does the jquery dev team have a freamework of choice which is used for such projects
[08:51:44] <bePolite> eg django bootstrap, laravel/ rails or some other custom stuff?
[08:51:56] <arschmitz> we generally do everything in node
[08:52:25] <arschmitz> aside from the probably not but it has to work with the learning center in some way which is wordpress
[08:53:43] <bePolite> hmm Okay
[08:55:35] <bePolite> arschmitz: no node frameworks like expressJs or the frameworks vary for specific projects?
[08:56:09] <arschmitz> bePolite: we dont have anything specific we use
[08:56:42] <bePolite> Okay
[08:57:27] <bePolite> I'll create a github issue later today with some requirements 
[09:59:54] <viduranga> Hi 
[10:00:02] <arthurvr> Hi viduranga!
[10:01:03] <viduranga> I wish you talk about gsoc project "Allow to crop/resize/rotate images when inserting them"
[10:01:31] <viduranga> I already added some comments here.https://tracker.moodle.org/browse/MDL-32183
[10:02:15] <viduranga> There are still some things I don't quite understand
[10:03:44] <arthurvr> Thatâ€™s a project submitted by Moodle, has nothing to do with jQuery?
[10:06:19] <viduranga> Ohh sorry.  I wanted to talk about this as you know :)
[10:06:23] <viduranga> https://github.com/jquery/content/issues/4
[10:10:14] <viduranga> Did you see my db diagram?
[10:12:01] <arthurvr> Oh. did not recognise your username.
[10:12:30] <viduranga> vpowerrc :)

[13:52:47] <arthurvr> gnarf: It would be nice if you would be able to get your review on https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/633. The current articles are based on your post.
[14:00:01] <arthurvr> That was quick. Thanks gnarf!
[20:42:00] <ShellHacker> @agcolom, I wanted to discuss furthur about the GSoC project of tracking github issues
[20:44:24] <ShellHacker> I was wondering if it was something like Waffle.io that was required as an internal tool to track all the issues on jQuery's projects, What other functionality should it hold other than displaying the status of the issues and a few more analytics details ?
