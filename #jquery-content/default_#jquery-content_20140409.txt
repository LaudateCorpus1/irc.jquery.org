[05:45:03] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: We don't seem to have an update button for our sites. This may be related to why auto-updates are working for us.
[05:46:19] <scott_gonzalez> s/are/aren't/
[08:39:02] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: indeed
[08:39:02] <b-ot> nacin: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[08:39:12] <nacin> `read
[08:39:12] <b-ot> nacin: From scott_gonzalez, 1w 6d ago: bugs.jqueryui.com only allows authenticated posts and we get spammed a lot. It's only bugs.jquery.com that's open to anonymous posting.
[08:40:04] <nacin> our bot just tells me whenever I join. I know you guys like it to wait, it would be nice for me to tell bot to just tell me instead of hiding in the corner :-)
