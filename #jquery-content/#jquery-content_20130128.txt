[02:51:33] <anthony> Hi guys 
[02:51:36] <anthony> Anyone around?
[02:55:56] <anthony> Anyone around?
[02:58:25] <anthony> Having trouble getting plugin to register - https://github.com/avanderhoorn/jQueryUriTemplates/blob/v1.0/uritemplate.jquery.json
[05:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: From jquery.com, `npm version build && git push && git push --tags`
[05:33:56] <scott_gonzalez> Obviously make sure you're up to date before doing that.
[10:20:25] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: and i don't risk, like, blowing up other sites or, like, how he that will rename nameless launched jquery.com when making an update to qunitjs.com?
[10:20:55] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Not if you're deploying a content repo.
[10:21:15] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-wp-content is the only thing that affects multiple sites.

[11:37:25] <tjfoetus> hi
[11:37:28] <tjfoetus> anyone here?
[11:38:18] <tjfoetus> I was just trying to publish a new jquery plugin
[11:38:36] <tjfoetus> I followed all the steps but the plugin is on the site yet
[11:43:12] <ajpiano> hi tjfoetus
[11:43:24] <tjfoetus> hi
[11:43:27] <ajpiano> tjfoetus: Mon, 28 Jan 2013 19:12:01 GMT github/tjfoetus/onestepcarousel 1.0.0 oscarousel.jquery.json has the following errors: Name must match manifest file name.
[11:43:45] <tjfoetus> :S
[11:43:49] <tjfoetus> where did you see that?
[11:43:56] <ajpiano> http://plugins.jquery.com/error.log
[11:43:57] <tjfoetus> how can I see those erros?
[11:44:08] <tjfoetus> thank you
[11:44:12] <tjfoetus> :)
[11:44:19] <ajpiano> we're working on getting better notification in place but that is in place for now :)
[11:44:26] <tjfoetus> ok
[11:44:30] <tjfoetus> that will work
[11:45:06] <tjfoetus> mm
[11:45:13] <tjfoetus> but that is not the file
[11:45:24] <tjfoetus> https://github.com/tjfoetus/onestepcarousel
[11:45:38] <tjfoetus> I updated the file time ago
[11:45:47] <tjfoetus> when I tested the manifest on the site
[11:46:56] <tjfoetus> nevermind
[11:47:02] <tjfoetus> Iam debuging already
[11:56:37] <ajpiano> tjfoetus: you have to push a new version
[11:56:48] <ajpiano> update the version in the package and create a new tag
[11:58:47] <tjfoetus> ah ok
[12:06:29] <jquicommit> [13api.jqueryui.com] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #94: Tooltip: Better description of position option  02http://git.io/g9HNeA
[12:06:54] <tjfoetus> done
[12:06:58] <tjfoetus> but the site says: Released 8 hours ago
[12:07:04] <tjfoetus> and I just pushed the plugin
[12:07:13] <tjfoetus> you should probably check that timestamp
[12:07:17] <tjfoetus> thanks though
[13:34:20] <agcolom> ajpiano: are you in charge of http://irc.jquery.org/ ?
[13:34:42] <ajpiano> yes
[13:34:45] <ajpiano> what's up agcolom
[13:34:47] <agcolom> I think I've spotted a typo but not 100% sure...
[13:35:05] <agcolom> right at the bottom, jquerymeeting...
[13:35:06] <agcolom> (no on can talk)
[13:35:42] <ajpiano> oh
[13:35:50] <ajpiano> thanks
[13:35:54] <agcolom> np :-)
[13:43:43] <ajpiano> how now jqcommit.........
[14:23:19] <ajpiano> https://twitter.com/_persianEagle/status/296008273491017728
[14:23:19] <b-ot> ajpiano: @_persianEagle: @jquery How can you explain it? http://t.co/2J1mXKTu
[14:23:28] <ajpiano> should we make the download box say min + gzip ?
[14:23:34] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: danheberden ^^
[14:24:07] <danheberden> ajpiano: the file is not gziped
[14:24:13] <DaveMethvin> yes, min+gzip, or even better don't show that number on the home page
[14:24:16] <ajpiano> i know
[14:24:27] <ajpiano> but like, when served with gzip
[14:24:33] <danheberden> hmm
[14:24:37] <DaveMethvin> right, but that's too much to say on the home page
[14:24:47] <ajpiano> confirm
[14:24:52] <danheberden> ugh
[14:25:10] <danheberden> how is this "Confirm" thing gaining traction
[14:25:12] <ajpiano> this guy isn't the first person to point it out :/
[14:25:34] <ajpiano> danheberden: i don't know, i just started using it after hanging out with yehuda and leah
[14:25:36] <danheberden> ajpiano: we say it on the home page though
[14:25:48] <danheberden> Only 32kB minified and gzipped
[14:25:54] <DaveMethvin> solution: don't say it on the home page ... people don't understand it
[14:25:57] <danheberden> lets kill the 32kB on the button
[14:26:06] <danheberden> and just have it under "lightweight footprint"
[14:26:12] <ajpiano> yeah, let's just kill the size on the button
[14:26:20] <ajpiano> +1 to dan
[14:26:33] <danheberden> i mean, we *could add "and Gzipped" to that
[14:26:35] <danheberden> but, whatever
[14:26:46] <DaveMethvin> lightweight footprint, just like my Air Heberdens
[14:26:54] <danheberden> haha
[14:26:58] <ajpiano> we also should adjust the site footer
[14:27:08] <ajpiano> it also says Minified: 33KB
[14:27:23] <danheberden> is there room for "Minified and Gzipped"
[14:27:26] <danheberden> ?
[14:27:28] <ajpiano> yup
[14:27:31] <danheberden> might as well be consistent
[14:27:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's too much detail imo and if the number goes up/down we need to change it in several places
[14:27:43] <danheberden> ajpiano: can you make that change and tag?
[14:27:48] <danheberden> i still need to get the download links up there
[14:28:09] <ajpiano> which download links
[14:28:16] <danheberden> the button and the link
[14:28:20] <danheberden> so that they go to the actual version
[14:28:23] <danheberden> instead of jquery.min.js
[14:28:42] <danheberden> so that people don't click "Download" and then copy that url into their <script> tag
[14:28:56] <danheberden> and we get bug reports for "you broke my site, you bitch"
[14:29:14] <ajpiano> you mean serve it up with content disposition attachment
[14:29:19] <danheberden> as for the footer, i think we should just have a link to the download page
[14:29:23] <DaveMethvin> that's why the download page has some discussion about it
[14:29:37] <danheberden> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/commit/7cd1baa0a8c5e7bc71258e913d27f25089ae6215
[14:29:38] <b-ot> danheberden: Dan Heberden (16h 29m ago): change download links to actual version numbers to prevent people copying the url into their script tags
[14:29:39] <danheberden> ajpiano: ^
[14:29:43] <danheberden> nothing amazing
[14:30:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah that was a good call danheberden
[14:31:08] <ajpiano> ah yea right on
[14:36:10] <ajpiano> we can just pull the sizes from the footer
[14:36:19] <ajpiano> then we don't have to add "and gzipped"
[14:36:34] <ajpiano> and then it's less to update on every release
[14:38:12] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: yeah, i'm just gonna make it a single link to the download page
[14:47:31] <RWhitbeck> How does blog content get edited .. through the wp-admin as normal?
[14:48:30] <ajpiano> for the time being, yes

[14:55:23] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: danheberden what do you think of stage.jquery.com now
[14:55:27] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano meet with Todd and Anne-Gaelle regarding the jquerymobile.com content and the blog was a fuzzy topic.  Not sure how that gets ported over to be honest. 
[14:56:22] <DaveMethvin> can we have the download button go to the download page ajp
[14:56:26] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: 
[14:56:42] <DaveMethvin> otherwise a lot of ppl will get 1.9 and not see the migrate plugin
[14:57:07] <ajpiano> RWhitbeck: it's an open question.  right now the ui and .com blogs go to their old set up just witha  "franken theme" of jquery-wp-content
[14:57:12] <DaveMethvin> also can we set a content-disposition header so the browser will know to download
[14:57:37] <ajpiano> RWhitbeck: we are either going to consolidate and merge all the blogs into a single site that will deploy through jquery-wp-content
[14:57:44] <RWhitbeck> ah I see.  So it's a traditional redesign of the current site. 
[14:57:54] <ajpiano> and have to migrate all the content  into static content
[14:58:08] <ajpiano> or we are going to just not merge them, but still move them over to static content + jquery-wp-content
[14:58:33] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: sure, yeah i was thinking the same thing
[14:58:35] <RWhitbeck> what are we going to do for the jquerymobile.com launch?  "franken theme"
[14:58:49] <ajpiano> RWhitbeck: it depends on the timing but probably yes, franken theme
[14:59:29] <RWhitbeck> Who's going to tackle that potentially?
[14:59:40] <ajpiano>  scott_gonzalez has been dealing with the franken themes
[15:00:25] <RWhitbeck> ah ok,  I know todd is trying to target mid-February.

[15:03:50] <ajpiano> alright
[15:04:01] <ajpiano> i'm gonna tag
[15:04:24] <danheberden> ajpiano: if that's the case
[15:04:31] <danheberden> re: the link
[15:04:39] <danheberden> we should get rid of the unminified link
[15:04:46] <ajpiano> accurate
[15:04:46] <danheberden> from under the button
[15:04:53] <danheberden> HA
[15:05:04] <danheberden> i see what you did there
[15:05:52] <danheberden> should we have like a "details on this release" link that points to the blog post?
[15:06:30] <ajpiano> or maybe directly to the upgrade guide
[15:08:04] <danheberden> will that be for all versions?
[15:08:14] <danheberden> like will 2.1 have 2.1 > 2.0 notes?
[15:08:54] <ajpiano> no but like
[15:08:59] <ajpiano> we can just use those links however we see fit
