[07:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You around? I've got an idea for an infrastructure tool to help us stay up-to-date with all of these sites.
[08:03:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ?
[08:03:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: whats up?
[08:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> I want to write a script that we'll run via cron to send an email when a site has updates that haven't been deployed for a while.
[08:05:27] <scott_gonzalez> I don't deploy after every commit, and it's hard to remember which sites are up-to-date.
[08:06:14] <scott_gonzalez> I can think of two metrics to track: # of commits since last tag and # of days since oldest non-deployed commit.
[08:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure what the thresholds should be. I was thinking 14, 21, 28... days
[08:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> So a weekly reminder, starting at 2 weeks.
[08:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> Seem reasonable?
[08:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> It'd require having a checkout of all the repos.
[08:09:42] <scott_gonzalez> We can either have another clone, or point it at the existing clones.
[08:09:52] <scott_gonzalez> But we'll need to be fetching master on the clones.
[08:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably do it with a fetch and not a pull, so it *should* be fine to point it at the existing clones.
[08:29:08] <ajpiano> thanks gnarf
[08:29:08] <b-ot> ajpiano: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.
[08:35:58] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: what i'm curious about really is what about check-modules and the deploy process made all the new sites blow up when they were deployed to prod for the first time
[08:36:42] <ajpiano> also should we tag to get the spam link off of the browser support page
[08:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> It's unrelated to either of those.
[08:37:04] <scott_gonzalez> The problem was with a dependency in a dependency in a dependency.
[08:37:15] <ajpiano> ah
[08:37:27] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't dig in, but I'm very much inclined to blame it on the grunt insanity that occurred.
[08:37:39] <ajpiano> lol i'm down with blaming everything on that
[08:37:48] <scott_gonzalez> IIRC, the problem originated in a grunt-contrib plugin.
[08:40:19] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: The problem was in grunt: npm ERR! invalid: pkginfo@0.3.0 /usr/local/wordpress-repos/learn.jquery.com/node_modules/grunt/node_modules/prompt/node_modules/pkginfo
[08:41:03] <ajpiano> aha
[08:42:58] <coodude> hi all! I was wondering if anyone would be able to help me get my plugin onto the plugin site. I am having problems and do not know what I am doing wrong.
[08:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> coodude: Check if there are any entries at http://plugins.jquery.com/error.log
[08:44:56] <coodude> thanks, but I cannot seem to find it in there.
[08:46:37] <ajpiano> what plugin are you trying to add? have you tried the manifest validator?
[08:47:16] <coodude> plugin is https://github.com/tgrant54/Navi.js  --> properly tested / validated manifest
[08:48:08] <ajpiano> coodude: your version would have had to be "1.4.0" not "1.4"
[08:48:15] <ajpiano> but now you've gotta tag 1.4.1 :)
[08:48:31] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: He doesn't need 1.4.1
[08:48:38] <scott_gonzalez> 1.4.0 was never processed because it doesn't exist.
[08:48:47] <ajpiano> ohhh
[08:48:48] <ajpiano> true dat
[08:49:07] <ajpiano> coodude: you can change it to 1.4.0 and tag it with v1.4.0 and it should be ok
[08:49:29] <coodude> ok, thanks, lemme try it out and ill get back to you

[09:02:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah - makes sense
[09:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Ok, I'll keep working on this script.
[09:03:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: If it were just a git fetch ; git log ...master 
[09:04:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: or something similar
[09:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..I suppose that can get us the list of commits based on the current checkouts which are on a tag.
[09:05:35] <Mottie> scott_gonzalez: is it just me or does the font being used in the sidebar too thick?... I mean the e's all look like blobs to me https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/182#issuecomment-12819811
[09:05:35] <b-ot> Mottie: Issue #182 by ajpiano (1w 4d ago): Font Awesome icons look squished on Windows
[09:06:16] <scott_gonzalez> Mottie: Are you on Windows?
[09:06:17] <ajpiano> Mottie: it def looks weird, i'm not sure why
[09:06:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: not sure if there might be a better way, but it would be pretty easy to do that
[09:06:22] <Mottie> yeah 
[09:06:23] <Mottie> Chrome
[09:06:28] <ajpiano>  ithought it was cause it was fake bold
[09:06:44] <ajpiano> but even if i set it to font-weight: normal; it still looks odd
[09:06:48] <Mottie> zoom @ 100% too
[09:07:17] <Mottie> if I zoom to 110% it looks "okay"
[09:08:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: don't forget about the strange ones
[09:08:19] <gnarf> like api.jquery.com-1.8
[09:08:27] <gnarf> which is based on origin/1-8
[09:08:29] <gnarf> or whatever
[09:09:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Good point, I'll need to add that to my list.
[09:10:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i would maybe make it "deploy-report.sh /path/to/a/repo origin-branch"
[09:11:14] <gnarf> and if the commit != the head of the branch, send an email saying its behind by ____ commits
[09:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I want it smarter than that though.
[09:11:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: in what way?
[09:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> We don't want a report just because there's a new commit that's an hour old.
[09:11:59] <gnarf> sure
[09:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> So, my script as is actually works with the 1-8 branch too.
[09:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> But it requires you to be in the branch that you want to check.
[09:14:06] <gnarf> "be in the branch" i.e. - checked out?
[09:14:16] <gnarf> all of the deploy scripts run in detached head
[09:15:28] <scott_gonzalez> My script won't work on a detached HEAD.
[09:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently you can't pass a ref to start from to `git describe`
[09:15:58] <gnarf> well, they all checkout specific sha's to do their work
[09:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> We can just clone them again, right?
[09:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see if I can take a different approach.
[09:16:53] <gnarf> i suppose we could, but if you want to know what's been deployed, shouldn't that work on detached head ?
[09:17:23] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/9ef6df19f8f9e370ad37
[09:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> git describe will always say you're up to date if you run against detached HEAD with a tag checked out.
[09:21:53] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is there anywhere that has a map of branch name to directory name for /usr/local/wordpress-repos?
[09:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> Or would I just need to build that into the script?
[09:23:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: puppet basically knows all that
[09:23:15] <gnarf> so when i setup whatever to run your script
[09:23:20] <gnarf> i could pass directory branch as arguments
[09:23:25] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:23:25] <gnarf> thats why i was suggesting it
[09:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I missed the space that separated the arguments in your sample exec call.
[10:08:35] <Chris____> having problem getting my plugin to show up in jquery plugin
[10:11:19] <ajpiano> hi Chris____
[10:11:42] <ajpiano> which plugin are you trying to add?
[10:12:03] <ajpiano> have you checked http://plugins.jquery.com/error.log and the validator on http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/
[10:14:10] <ajpiano> ChrisR: [13:11 ] <ajpiano> hi Chris____
[10:14:10] <ajpiano> [13:11 ] <ajpiano> which plugin are you trying to add?
[10:14:10] <ajpiano> [13:12 ] <ajpiano> have you checked http://plugins.jquery.com/error.log and the validator on http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/
[10:14:21] <ChrisR> can anyone help me troubleshoot why i cannot get my plugin to "show" in the jquery plugin list? I have followed all the instructions for "Publishing Your Plugin"
[10:14:31] <ChrisR> PrintArea
[10:15:05] <ajpiano> can you link to your package manifest?
[10:15:51] <ChrisR> thank you, i don't see my plugin in the .log https://github.com/RitsC/PrintArea/blob/master/jquery.PrintArea.js
[10:16:26] <ajpiano> ChrisR: unfortunately "2.1" is not a valid semver, you have to use "2.1.0"
[10:16:38] <ajpiano> you can update your jquery.json and retag with 2.1.0 and it should work
[10:16:42] <ChrisR> i see
[10:16:49] <ChrisR> and sorry that was not my manifest.... :)
[10:16:57] <ajpiano> sokay i found my way :)
[10:21:30] <ChrisR> log says successfully added !
[10:25:49] <ChrisR_> thank you ajpiano, it worked
[10:38:17] <ajpiano> http://wpdaily.co/jquery-site/
[10:44:00] <gnarf> nice writeup
[10:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> "...one of the coolest WordPress configurations I‚Äôve ever heard of..." :-)
[10:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> We've come a long way from my direct SQL hacking.
[10:50:20] <ajpiano> yeah, that was my favourite part :)
[10:51:00] <scott_gonzalez> It's funny to think this all started with me reverse engineering WordPress by inspecting database changes for each thing I did in wp-admin.
[10:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> How did I ever think that would work?
[10:51:34] <ajpiano> haha yeah,
[10:51:36] <ajpiano> but we rolled with it
[10:51:44] <ajpiano> i remember manually tracking your changes
[10:51:48] <ajpiano> to try and make it work with the learn site
[10:52:05] <gnarf> i wonder where we'd be if we hadn't run into nacin in DC
[10:52:06] <gnarf> ;)
[10:52:11] <ajpiano> how long did it take to go from the raw queries to go to XML RPC once we did
[10:52:23] <ajpiano> gnarf: yeah, seriously
[10:52:39] <scott_gonzalez> Not too long, it was pretty quick.
[10:52:53] <scott_gonzalez> Though I had to start implementing custom XML-RPC methods as WordPress plugins :-P
[10:53:04] <nacin> :-)
[10:53:26] <scott_gonzalez> If we didn't run into nacin, I'd probably be hiding under my desk right now as a million things simultaneously fail.
[10:53:35] <Mottie> LOL
[10:54:02] <ajpiano> yeah i literally have no idea
[10:54:08] <nacin> server load is 1.52
[10:54:13] <ajpiano> you had to like, set up each site in the multi site install yourself
[10:54:18] <scott_gonzalez> We also would have a half-assed multi-site setup.
[10:54:22] <ajpiano> ^^
[10:54:39] <nacin> gnarf: if you still want to set up a complex server cluster, let me know :-)
[10:55:03] <gnarf> nacin: one of these days we might need to
[10:55:03] <ajpiano> i'm still waiting for the "BUT I HERD WERDPRESS IS SLOEWW"
[10:55:17] <gnarf> I still kinda wanna make sure we have a backup server in the wings
[10:55:23] <gnarf> but
[10:55:33] <nacin> yes, totally. there are a lot of optimizations we can probably still do, as well. I'd love to improve response times still.
[10:55:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: speaking of backups, where is plugins.db backed up?
[10:55:46] <ajpiano> +9001
[10:55:50] <gnarf> i guess right now my fear is more about losing every website at once
[10:56:07] <gnarf> if that server stops
[10:56:13] <gnarf> than it is about load
[10:56:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it was going to backup to /var/backups/plugins on jq02, but the script broke, and i haven't fixed it yet
[10:56:47] <ajpiano> yeah i am presently panicking more about the plugins.db backup
[10:56:50] <gnarf> I need to actually just make it a .sh
[10:56:56] <ajpiano> can you fix that like, A$AP
[10:57:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, fix it before ajpiano accidentally deletes it trying to tail the logs :-P
[10:57:27] <gnarf> ajpiano: yeah, it's also got some level of version controllyness due to its hard drive being a virtual image :)
[10:57:43] <ajpiano> ah
[10:57:44] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:57:47] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: lollll
[10:57:54] <ajpiano> i only look at error.log!
[10:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> OMG, it is so nice having that delay removed.
[10:58:37] <ajpiano> i didn't realilse it was taken out
[10:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Oh, did you not see my stupid mistake that was causing the problem?
[10:59:04] <ajpiano> nope!
[10:59:14] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/commit/75d548dffae46b9761e3f265286833fdbc02ccae
[10:59:14] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Scott Gonz√°lez (5d 5h ago): Remove delay before processing a request. Fix early return from git fetch.
[11:00:07] <ajpiano> oops
[11:00:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm so used to `return asyncFn();` I forgot that Step treats return values as meaning that the current step is sync.
[11:01:28] <scott_gonzalez> Also, who knew that node-semver was designed to run in the browser too?
[11:01:53] <scott_gonzalez> I figured that out just know working on using the real validator in the docs.
[11:01:57] <ajpiano> it's interesting that things weren't even finishing in 20 secs
[11:02:04] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i was wondering the same thing a few minutes ago
[11:02:08] <ajpiano> last night a guy i was helping said
[11:02:24] <ajpiano> "Jesus crist, you guys must be flooded with people on the brink of killing themselves for not getting this thing to work"
[11:02:29] <ajpiano> and i was like, nah, it really isn't that bad :p
[11:02:32] <jqcommit> [13jquery-wp-content] 15markjaquith opened pull request #193: Remove a WordPress 3.4.x shim that is no longer needed (06master...06remove-unused-wp-shim)  02http://git.io/MJPXyw
[11:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[11:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> Having this quasi-validator in place is kinda bad.
[11:03:00] <ajpiano> hey check out mark jaquith on the PR
[11:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's overly restrictive in some places and super lax in others.
[11:03:19] <gnarf> i see that
[11:03:20] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah, confirm that
[11:03:40] <ajpiano> it's arguably better than nothing
[11:03:51] <ajpiano> we should prob make that validator also allow you to just paste JSON
[11:04:04] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I want to stab myself in the eye when I look at resources/validate.js in that repo.
[11:04:06] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: what i'm really curious about is like, what do other services that use webhooks use to confirm to the user that the thing is working
[11:04:43] <scott_gonzalez> Most don't, I would think.
[11:04:51] <scott_gonzalez> They just do what they do and move on.
[11:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> Like the Trac integration.
[11:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> Or the IRC bot.
[11:05:44] <ajpiano> ah
[11:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> Either your bug gets updated in Trac and you see commit notifications in IRC or you don't.
[11:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> Same with us right now, either your plugin gets listed or it doesn't.
[11:06:15] <ajpiano> right
[11:06:20] <scott_gonzalez> The big difference being that you're probably not staring at the site when you tag.
[11:06:31] <ajpiano> some people seemed to be
[11:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> And also this is hundreds of users setting it up, with essentially their own config (the manifest files).
[11:06:54] <ajpiano> i've been amazed by people who managed to send us an e-mail saying it wasn't working, between the time they added the hook and it was actually added successfuly
[11:07:11] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: how many are in there now
[11:07:45] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure 1,231 posts.
[11:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> So, at most 600
[11:08:52] <ajpiano> sounds about right
[11:09:14] <ajpiano> more than i woulda expected in 2 weeks really even
[11:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'd need to either query the SQLite or MySQL db to get the exact number.
[11:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's a good amount for being so new.
[11:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> The admin interface doesn't seem to have a way to list just parent posts.
[11:11:31] <gnarf> i'll do the backup script when i get back
[11:11:35] <gnarf> afk ~hour or so
[11:19:39] <ChrisR> I was having problems with tags and matching versions. My first update was to 2.1.0, but I think i actually want to start at 2.0.1 
[11:20:21] <ChrisR> so now i cannot get the changes pushed up to plugin repository
[11:21:17] <ChrisR> are the Service Hooks refreshed periodically?
[11:22:35] <ChrisR> plus i needed to fix my description ( plugin name is PrintArea )
[11:23:28] <nacin> just confirming, did comments from api.jquery.com go away on purpose?
[11:36:28] <ChrisR> can i "downgrad" my version jquery plugin version?
[11:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Yes.
[11:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> ChrisR: No.
[11:44:34] <ChrisR> i tried to change my version from 2.1.0 to 2.0.1, but have not been successful in updating my plugin since
[11:45:10] <ChrisR> scott: sorry, just received your response 
[11:54:41] <scott_gonzalez> ChrisR: Well, 2.0.1 didn't get posted because you didn't update the version number in your manifest file.
[11:54:51] <scott_gonzalez> You can't delete and tag again, the plugins site will ignore it.
[11:55:16] <scott_gonzalez> But even if 2.0.1 was successfully posted, 2.1.0 would still be the one that shows up on the main page.
[11:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's the latest version.
[11:57:46] <ChrisR> right, ok... i upped my version to 2.1.1, changed my manifest and added the tag 2.1.1 to git 
[11:58:20] <nacin> gnarf: 3.5.1 is a security release, let's do that now. there will be zero issues with swapping it out.
[11:58:55] <nacin> gnarf: and if it's just a matter of doing a `mv wordpress wordpress-old && mv wordpress-new wordpress` I'm happy to do it.

[13:04:41] <ajpiano> nice scott_gonzalez
[13:05:22] <scott_gonzalez> The custom build of that file is pretty nice ;-)
[13:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> Too bad I had to inject a semicolon because of node-semver.
[13:06:22] <ajpiano> hahah
[13:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...we need to get the stripe code out of plugins.js
[13:08:04] <scott_gonzalez> Stripe is unbelievably slow.

[13:18:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: tarball backup script working now
[13:18:28] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:18:31] <gnarf> so its backed up on the same server
[13:18:38] <gnarf> still need the remote backups stuff working
[13:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should get that working soon :-)
[13:18:53] <gnarf> ryanneufeld and I have a little polish to toss on that before its backing everything up to citadel
[13:19:04] <ryanneufeld> you rang?
[13:19:15] <ryanneufeld> oh, yeah, that
[13:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I'm done for now. Heading downstairs to build more walls.
[13:19:35] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: maybe a hack evening on finishing that up this week?
[13:19:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you mean destroy more staircases? :)
[13:20:15] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't broken anything yet!
[13:20:31] <gnarf> just shaving corners?
[13:20:34] <gnarf> literally? :)
[13:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> I did have to take down all the handrails to get the drywall down though.
[13:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> But tonight I'm just doing some more framing.
[13:29:00] <Mottie> scott_gonzalez: Hey I just tried out the "Validate Your Manifest File Here" and I chose a file... it updated the file name, then nothing.
[13:32:42] <gnarf> afk
[14:55:28] <danheberden> Mottie: what browser?
[15:04:46] <Mottie> Chrome
[15:04:55] <Mottie> for Windows 7
[15:05:42] <danheberden> hmm, you should get SOME feedback - either "contratulations..." or something
[15:05:52] <Mottie> let me try again
[15:06:35] <danheberden> Mottie: it will look something like this http://danheberden.com/share/ae3e.png
[15:06:36] <danheberden> upon errors
[15:07:53] <ajpiano> Mottie: same here in windows
[15:07:59] <ajpiano> working fine in mac
[15:08:01] <ajpiano> eritf
[15:08:02] <ajpiano> weird
[15:08:12] <danheberden> i'm unfamiliar with what was changed
[15:08:18] <danheberden> but i can take a peek in a bit
[15:08:26] <danheberden> any errors?
[15:08:30] <danheberden> in console?
[15:08:46] <Mottie> http://i46.tinypic.com/2klj6s.jpg
[15:08:55] <Mottie> nothing in console
[15:09:08] <danheberden> must be something in the file stream
[15:09:35] <Mottie> the response is the manifest file
[15:09:46] <Mottie> I know it worked because I just registered it
[15:11:03] <Mottie> darn Windows users *shake fist*
[15:11:33] <ajpiano> yeah i am tetsting with your manifest file and no output at all
[15:11:35] <ajpiano> indeed
[15:11:42] <Mottie> very odd
[15:13:15] <ajpiano> and your manifest file also works on chrome for mac
[15:13:26] <ajpiano> double you tee eff
[15:13:32] <Mottie> LOL
[15:17:57] <ajpiano> also the invalid json try catch seems to break in chrome for windows
[15:18:34] <ajpiano> weird and ben's manifest DOES work in chrome on windows
[15:19:36] <Mottie> is it better for me to report stuff here or open a ticket?
[15:20:17] <ajpiano> combination :)
[15:20:27] <Mottie> lol ok
[15:20:37] <ajpiano> i'm trying to poke at it now, but clearly some stuff is not right
[15:25:10] <ajpiano> aaaand i was testing the wrong code on windows
[15:25:18] <Mottie> DOH
[15:27:05] <ajpiano> Mottie: http://plugins.jquery.com/resources/validate.js
[15:27:19] <ajpiano> Mottie: i was just able to get your thing to validate in the tool just fine
[15:27:25] <ajpiano> just make sure you have the most recent file
[15:27:36] <ajpiano> (in windows)
[15:27:45] <Mottie> is there a version number?
[15:28:21] <ajpiano> nope
[15:28:46] <ajpiano> what's the first line of that file
[15:29:01] <Mottie> (function() {
[15:29:16] <ajpiano> it doesn't say //nothing in here is node-specific
[15:29:18] <ajpiano> ?
[15:29:18] <Mottie> ahhh refresh.. now it's (function() {;(function (exports) { // nothing in here is node-specific.
[15:29:24] <ajpiano> ah
[15:29:25] <ajpiano> there we go
[15:29:28] <ajpiano> ok now you should be ok
[15:29:45] <Mottie> *rumble* I just cleared my cache manually yesterday too... I had an issue with jsfiddle
[15:30:03] <ajpiano> this just got updated like 3 hours ago tho
[15:30:24] <ajpiano> we need to get versioning on our css/js so this doesn't happen in general tho
[15:30:25] <Mottie> YAY Congratulations, your manifest file is valid.
[15:30:28] <Mottie> thanks
[15:30:33] <Mottie> sorry for the headache
[18:22:20] <scott_gonzalez> Stupid caching.
[18:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> That's a pretty sexy first line though, huh?
[18:22:49] <scott_gonzalez> (function() {;(function (exports) { // nothing in here is node-specific.
[20:22:06] <ryanneufeld> I'd like to contribute to the jquery-ui demos
[20:22:20] <ryanneufeld> would that mean just editing the html files in the jqueryui.com repo?
[20:25:29] <ryanneufeld> ping scott_gonzalez ajpiano
[20:52:38] <ryanneufeld> helloooo?
