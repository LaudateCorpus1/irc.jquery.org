[07:37:56] <doedje> hi there..
[07:40:54] <doedje> is there a delay between the correctly parsing of my new manifest and updating the plugins page?
[07:41:11] <doedje> if so I'll quit pushing ctrl-R ;)
[07:42:09] <doedje> about an hour ago I pushed a new version to github..... found this in your error.log
[07:42:10] <doedje> Tue, 26 Feb 2013 14:54:10 GMT github/doedje/jquery.soap SUCCESSFULLY ADDED soap v0.9.3!
[07:42:37] <doedje> but http://plugins.jquery.com/soap/ is still showing the 0.9.2 version...
[07:43:08] <doedje> it was much quicker, as in instant! when I updated the previous versions...
[07:47:47] <scott_gonzalez> doedje: I'll check the server, the process may have died.
[07:48:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, process is dead.
[07:49:24] <doedje> aha!
[07:51:30] <scott_gonzalez> And this is why the script that handles the GitHub hooks is separate from the script that updates the site :-)
[07:51:59] <doedje> :D
[07:52:28] <doedje> I must say that I am rather impressed by the new plugins website!
[07:52:43] <doedje> and it got me using github too! :D
[07:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> added
[07:52:49] <doedje> thanx for that
[07:52:58] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You around?
[07:53:04] <scott_gonzalez> We need to find out why this died.
[07:53:10] <scott_gonzalez> I just restarted and it's running fine.
[07:53:21] <scott_gonzalez> But I've got it running in my terminal with --console.
[07:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna do a restart on the manager.
[07:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> Manager restarted, all processes running.
[07:57:36] <doedje> well, thanx for adding.. my working day is just about to end ;) home-sweet-home!
[07:57:41] <doedje> bye

[12:14:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: which process died?
[12:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> wordpress-update
[12:15:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so, i have a thought about something we can reuse
[12:15:45] <gnarf> a default "unhandled exception" handler
[12:16:01] <gnarf> to just dump a "progname.dump" file and blow up like it would anyway
[12:16:17] <gnarf> last crash always shown in the .dump
[12:16:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: There's already an unhandled exception handler in each script.
[12:16:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but, its using logger.log?
[12:16:54] <gnarf> and/or is that working?
[12:16:55] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure it works.
[12:18:13] <gnarf> hrm
[12:18:23] <gnarf> im just not seeing anything really "dump" ish in the logs
[12:18:48] <gnarf> one of the reasons i was thinking just writing to a file, and stderr / logger.err might work
[12:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I think I just ungzipped all the old logs.
[12:20:02] <gnarf> you may of
[12:20:02] <gnarf> ps
[12:20:07] <gnarf> zcat logname.2.gz | less
[12:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[12:20:53] <scott_gonzalez> I ran `gunzip syslog.1.gz | grep ...`
[12:20:59] <scott_gonzalez> Which was silly.
[12:21:27] <gnarf> i regziped
[12:22:03] <gnarf> for i in *.{1-6}; do gzip $i; done
[12:22:04] <gnarf> :)
[12:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> `grep Uncaught` didn't give any results in any of the syslog or messages files.
[12:23:49] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure that when it was actually crashing that other time it did log to syslog.
[12:50:40] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: gnarf bunch of ot'ers experiencing the domain mapping issue
[12:50:43] <ajpiano> right now on jquery.om
[12:50:45] <ajpiano> c
[12:54:30] <gnarf> hrm
[12:57:35] <gnarf> cc nacin
[12:57:51] <gnarf> http://tbranyen.com/u/a340f3f0.png
[12:58:04] <gnarf> this happens apparently every now and then and then stops
[12:58:31] <gnarf> i imagine its a 2 minute window when it got one bad request?
[12:59:10] <nacin> I would imagine it's happening whenever puppets deploy
[12:59:13] <gnarf> i just am looking for some possible reason that it would respond with that in the first place
[12:59:49] <gnarf> and no, puppet didn't run anywhere near that last one
[13:00:19] <gnarf> nor were there any deploys happening
[13:00:26] <gnarf> nor was anyone logged in
[13:02:49] <nacin> okay
[13:02:53] <rworth> nacin in wp-admin where it says "Usernames cannot be changed." is that a ui or a system-level restriction?
[13:02:58] <nacin> UI
[13:03:02] <rworth> thanks
[13:03:05] <nacin> gnarf: going to add some error logging
[13:03:33] <rworth> nacin so we're safe collecting only email addresses today and someday letting people select an available preferred username?
[13:03:45] <nacin> rworth: yes
[13:03:51] <rworth> perfect
[13:04:00] <nacin> gnarf: do we have access log entries for everything?
[13:04:07] <gnarf> nacin: we should
[13:04:11] <nacin> like, can I look up one of your IPs and find the exact entry
[13:04:16] <gnarf>  /var/log/nginx/jquery.com.access.log
[13:05:04] <gnarf> 14:49 is when people complained
[13:05:05] <nacin> someone PM me an IP address?
[13:05:07] <gnarf> or well
[13:05:24] <gnarf> 12:49 on the server
[13:05:37] <nacin> so a few hours ago
[13:07:31] <gnarf> nacin: grep '"GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 99' /var/log/nginx/jquery.com.access.log
[13:09:40] <gnarf> nacin: hrm
[13:09:44] <nacin> so, it seems like this could happen if HTTP_HOST is sent in a case-insensitive manner, or for another domain
[13:09:50] <gnarf> nacin: can we make that domain mapping error
[13:09:53] <gnarf> not a 200 ?
[13:10:20] <nacin> this domain mapping error was never supposed to be a public error
[13:11:04] <gnarf> agree, but it should probably be a 400 anyway yeah?
[13:11:25] <gnarf> 400 Bad Request
[13:12:20] <nacin> where can I do an error_log() to?
[13:13:32] <nacin> is /var/log/domain_mapping ok?
[13:13:53] <gnarf> as www-data?
[13:13:57] <nacin> yeah
[13:14:05] <gnarf> hrm
[13:14:19] <gnarf> better to use /tmp i think
[13:15:01] <nacin> how is www-data writing to var/log/nginx?
[13:15:09] <gnarf> it isn't
[13:15:12] <gnarf> thats nginx
[13:15:14] <gnarf> thats root
[13:15:36] <nacin> -rw-r----- 1 www-data adm 243208178 Feb 26 13:15 /var/log/nginx/jquery.com.access.log
[13:15:44] <gnarf> i think it might chown it
[13:16:05] <gnarf> either way
[13:16:09] <gnarf> if this is a permanent thing
[13:16:24] <nacin> not permanent
[13:16:28] <nacin> just until we know what is causing this
[13:16:28] <gnarf> then just use /tmp
[13:21:05] <gnarf> nacin: also, maybe add $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] to the die() ?
[13:22:06] <gnarf> i think we should make that a 400 Bad Request - print out the $_SERVER['HTTP_HOST'] and log to /tmp/domain-mapping.log 
[13:23:36] <gnarf> also, perhaps, just to be safe - strtolower it?
[13:28:13] <gnarf> nacin: thinkin something like this: https://gist.github.com/gnarf37/7951d83e038b0f3234e2
[13:28:53] <gnarf> not sure what "log" stuff you want
[13:29:05] <gnarf> but i can push that ^^^ if you want me to
[13:31:26] <nacin> gnarf: I want to figure out what is going wrong, rather than blindly fix the issues
[13:31:35] <nacin> so I'm going to A) log and B) when we can't figure out the domain, assume it is jquery.com
[13:31:47] <nacin> that way we won't see any issues for now, and we can look at the logs to figure out the right fix

[13:33:12] <gnarf> nacin: seems good
[13:33:30] <gnarf> i'll tag it to deploy it to live
[13:33:35] <nacin> just did `touch /tmp/domain_mapping.log && chown www-data /tmp/domain_mapping.log` on jq01

[13:37:28] <gnarf> those www{1-2}jqueryui.com shouldn't make it there anymore
[13:37:36] <gnarf> just removed from dns
[13:42:52] <nacin> okay. just wiped the log.
[13:43:09] <nacin> one other one in there was www.jquery.com, which was a bit weird. will see if it shows up again.
[14:17:13] <gnarf> heh
[14:17:14] <gnarf> www.scottywakefield.net
[14:20:44] <gnarf> I'm almost thinking I'd rather serve 400 etc like I did than push out a jquery.com on a broken map

[22:27:51] <joelbirch> Hello, looks like the jQuery plugin registry is not updating properly. I just pushed v1.5.9 of my Superfish plugin but it isn't showing on the site. The error log shows that it was successful, though. This happened a couple of weeks ago and scott_gonzalez fixed it.
[22:32:09] <joelbirch> I vaguely remember that one of the daemons didn't restart after crashing - if that makes any sense?
[22:51:38] <gnarf> yeah, wordpress updater crashed again cc scott_gonzalez
[22:51:45] <gnarf> I'm running it in console now
[22:52:28] <gnarf> joelbirch: btw, i'm an old school fan of superfish
[22:52:31] <gnarf> haven't used it in a while
[22:52:35] <gnarf> but +1 :)
[23:51:37] <joelbirch> haha awesome. Thanks :)
