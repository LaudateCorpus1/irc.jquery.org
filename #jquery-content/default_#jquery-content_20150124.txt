[08:41:07] <arthurvr> in the learn site, what‚Äôs the right commit component for removing a hole section?
[08:41:35] <arschmitz> arthurvr: learn is super weird for components
[08:41:45] <arthurvr> arschmitz: yes it is
[08:41:58] <arschmitz> with other repos they are pretty clear learn not at all
[08:42:14] <arthurvr> normally we use `Build`, `Order` or the name of the article
[08:42:27] <arschmitz> what are you removing?
[08:42:34] <arthurvr> JS101 section
[08:42:48] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/622
[08:42:59] <arschmitz> i would just do like Javascript101: then maybe 
[08:43:33] <arschmitz> i mean the reality is they dont really matter so much here 
[08:43:54] <arschmitz> the reason we are picky about them has more to do with the actual libs where we use them to generate changelogs
[08:44:08] <arschmitz> i dont see learn ever generating a changelog
[08:45:02] <arthurvr> k. We talked about relaxing the commit style guide a bit: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/default_%23jquery-meeting_20150114.log.html#t10:21:19
[08:45:59] <arthurvr> can I already start doing that?
[08:46:56] <arschmitz> yeah i remember i dont see why not 
[08:47:11] <arschmitz> i think we concluded to actually do it so if a decsion was actually made
[08:47:18] <arschmitz> there is no reason i can think of to wait?
[08:47:34] <arthurvr> till it gets on contribute. site?
[08:48:15] <arschmitz> Yeah i just re read whole thing
[08:48:28] <arschmitz> and we decided not to actually change until we found a compelling reason it seems
[08:48:49] <arthurvr> yup
[08:49:14] <arschmitz> oh but that was to not use component
[08:49:21] <arschmitz> not to be more lax about components
[08:49:38] <arschmitz> dan had suggested danheberden	for learn, the "component" could just be article, tutorial, content-update, fix
[08:49:54] <arschmitz> which in this case i would say it would be content-update?
[08:52:02] <arthurvr> unclear - I think I‚Äôll go for ‚ÄùJavascript 101‚Äù right now and wait till it‚Äôs all documented on contribute site.
[08:52:25] <arschmitz> yeah thats what i would have done to begin with lol
[08:52:41] <arthurvr> :)
[08:53:31] <arthurvr> I thinked as ‚Äùthese aren‚Äôt really changes to that section, so that‚Äôs not the right component‚Äù

[11:46:33] <arthurvr> gnarf: RWhitbeck: who has access to change the topics?
[11:52:39] <RWhitbeck> arthurvr: I'm very IRC illiteral ... I am amazed I figured out how to join channels.  :P  I think gnarf has the keys to the kingdom here or can direct you to the right person.
