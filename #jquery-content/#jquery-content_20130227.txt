[01:51:15] <gnarf> that tagged message has the wrong commit sha
[01:51:16] <gnarf> wtf
[01:55:44] <gnarf> nacin|away: After looking at the results in the .log file, I really think we should just 400 them with the domain mapping error message
[01:57:15] <gnarf> the *.jquery.com server_name is just used by default, each site gets its own server directive when we bring them live
[06:25:19] <nacin> gnarf: you had suggested yesterday that everyone was seeing that error while trying to access jquery.com
[06:29:35] <gnarf> nacin: they were, because somewhere it falls through to the jquery.com site and nginx's fastcgi_cache stores the 200 result for 2 minutes
[06:31:19] <nacin> I see
[06:32:42] <nacin> that is weird, considering fastcgi_cache_key includes $host
[06:32:51] <gnarf> yeah
[06:33:07] <gnarf> i mean, maybe *.jquery.com and jquery.com have the same $host or something
[06:33:10] <gnarf> makes no sense
[06:33:12] <gnarf> but
[06:34:13] <nacin> grep -A 1 HTTP_HOST /tmp/domain_mapping.log | grep string | sort
[06:35:12] <gnarf> maybe its the jquery.com:80 
[06:35:13] <gnarf> ?
[06:36:37] <nacin> not sure
[06:37:03] <nacin> noticing that archive.plugins.jquery.com is getting caught in here
[06:37:11] <nacin> probably should be a redirect, if it isn't already
[06:37:20] <nacin> same for www.jquery.com, not sure what is going on there
[06:39:22] <gnarf> yeah, www.jquery.com should get caught by a different host
[06:39:29] <gnarf> archive.plugins shouldn't even point at that ip
[06:40:08] <gnarf> nacin: https://gist.github.com/gnarf37/e4831bdfd6503bf7e1d7
[06:41:00] <nacin> yeah, I know
[09:14:57] <gnarf> nacin: any further thoughts?
[09:23:37] <nacin> probably strip ports, strip www, strtolower, and if that still fails, probably a redirect to jquery.com
[09:25:51] <gnarf> the redirect on production, error anywhere else?
[09:26:09] <gnarf> I'll code it up later
[09:27:13] <nacin> probably, yes

[14:40:15] <nacin> is @TimoTijhof in this channel?
[14:41:21] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: No, but he's Krinkle on IRC.
[14:41:27] <nacin> thanks
[14:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> No problem. He hangs out in the -dev channels.
[14:54:24] <nacin> I figured. And I thought he was Krinkle but needed confirmation. :)
