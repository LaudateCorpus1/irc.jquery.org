[06:06:08] <jqcommit> 13jquery-wp-content/06master 14749b21d 15Scott Gonz√°lez: plugins.jquery.com: Cleanup single template.
[06:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> There's still some more cleanup to do, but after my first pass through each template, I've got the plugins.jquery.com style.css down from 869 lines to 365 lines and removed a few custom templates.
[06:08:34] <ajpiano> awesome
[06:09:19] <scott_gonzalez> Along the way, I also removed some custom templates from other sites and implemented more base templates :-)
[06:09:51] <ajpiano> nice
[06:10:04] <ajpiano> i had a weird dream that i got expelled from hs by my brother's 4th grade teacher
[06:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:10:22] <ajpiano> i asked what the deal with some lockers in the senior hallways was
[06:10:27] <ajpiano> she said they were $15 for every 30 minutes
[06:10:31] <ajpiano> i said "you're fucking with me"
[06:10:44] <ajpiano> and then she was like ok you're kicked out of school for cursing at a teacher
[06:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:10:54] <ajpiano> then a rapper poured cough syrup in my ear
[06:11:02] <ajpiano> and i stopped being able to use the computer
[06:11:06] <ajpiano> so i'm still working my way through that one
[06:11:22] <ajpiano> BUT OTHERWISE
[06:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> Other than ajpiano's insanity and lack of sleep, he's going great.
[06:11:48] <scott_gonzalez> s/going/doing/
[06:11:51] <ajpiano> :D
[06:11:56] <ajpiano> i caught up this weekend
[06:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> oh, good
[06:12:26] <scott_gonzalez> I was really hoping to get a full day in over the weekend, but it didn't happen :-/
[06:12:28] <ajpiano> so now i just have lots and lots of words to write
[06:12:32] <ajpiano> of work, or sleep :p
[06:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> Got a few hours in last night right before bed though.
[06:12:48] <ajpiano> ah yeah, i saw that
[06:12:49] <scott_gonzalez> heh, of work
[06:13:56] <ajpiano> i had a good idea for a site feature over the weekend
[06:14:12] <ajpiano> but one that would instantly be closed with "roadmap candidate" so i'mma chill
[06:14:12] <ajpiano> :p
[06:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[06:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, have you thought about the tag line for the plugins site?
[06:14:53] <ajpiano> but some ajax nav with pushstate on sites like API would probably be a nice experience, sometime down the line
[06:15:26] <ajpiano> guh, nope
[06:16:09] <ajpiano> ooh
[06:16:21] <ajpiano> "The jQuery Plugin Registry: The Best $.fn Site in the World"
[06:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> LOVE IT
[06:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> Can we do it for real?
[06:17:14] <ajpiano> i donno
[06:17:18] <scott_gonzalez> Or is this rockstar theme all over again?
[06:17:22] <ajpiano> it's a little risque
[06:17:24] <ajpiano> but it's so awesome
[06:17:26] <ajpiano> i think we can't :(
[06:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[06:17:37] <ajpiano> let's see what rworth thinks :p
[06:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> In the meantime, I'm going to switch to just "The jQuery Plugin Registry" so that it's releasable.

[12:23:29] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: did you see my ping yesterday re creating a new sub-category of a new category in categories.xml? it no workie
[12:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: I did, but I was a bit overwhelmed. I still am, but explain again what you need :-P
[12:25:50] <kswedberg> :) ok. 
[12:27:13] <kswedberg> https://gist.github.com/4533081
[12:27:56] <kswedberg> I put that in categories.xml and then in the toggle-event.xml entry I added <category slug="deprecated/1.8"/>
[12:28:27] <kswedberg> It created the deprecated category but not the 1.8 subcategory
[12:28:39] <kswedberg> ‚Üë
[12:28:48] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez ‚Üë
[12:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it should work, I wonder if it's related to the slug of the subcategory matching another subcategory slug?
[12:37:44] <kswedberg> I wondered that, too, so I changed it to "d1.8" and it still didn't create it.
[12:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try locally.
[12:38:18] <kswedberg> k
[12:50:06] <scott_gonzalez> Still trying to figure out what's going on.
[12:50:39] <kswedberg> k. thx for looking into it.
[12:51:46] <scott_gonzalez> No problem. This week isn't hectic at all :-P
[12:52:01] <kswedberg> heh :)
[12:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> Well, so far I've confirmed that it's properly converted to JSON.

[13:15:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm making *some* progress on this.
[13:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> The JSON serialization is actually different, but I'm not sure why.
[13:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Ugh, There are no categories with exactly one subcategory, are there?
[13:17:21] <kswedberg> dunno. could that be the problem? I can add another subcat and see if that works. 
[13:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> I think that's the problem. Confirming now.
[13:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> So the XML -> JSON serialization produces different results for a single child :-/
[13:18:57] <kswedberg> weird!!
[13:22:09] <scott_gonzalez> I think WordPress might not be happy with the duplicated slugs.
[13:22:30] <danheberden> banana slugs
[13:22:46] <kswedberg> danheberden: you funny man
[13:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Did we have these same category names in the old site?
[13:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I've got a question for you, unrelated to this ongoing conversation ;-)
[13:23:25] <nacin> howdy
[13:23:31] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: we had a deprecated category, but not the deprecated version subcategories
[13:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: We've got a function for getting popular tags: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/themes/plugins.jquery.com/functions.php#L123
[13:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> But, we have a lot of "duplicate" posts, since this is the plugins site.
[13:24:32] <scott_gonzalez> So there's a post for every version and another for "latest".
[13:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> Which results in inflated results for each tag.
[13:24:55] <nacin> are the plugins hierarchical?
[13:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:25:07] <scott_gonzalez>  /foo and /foo/1.2.3
[13:25:13] <nacin> maybe tags should only be assigned to /foo, not /foo/1.2.3?
[13:25:26] <scott_gonzalez> You can change the tags for each version though.
[13:25:46] <scott_gonzalez> So it's not clear what the best solution is here.
[13:25:50] <nacin> but the only tags that matter are the latest ones, right?
[13:26:00] <scott_gonzalez> But I think in terms of popular tags, I think only listing the numbers for the latest release of each plugin makes sense.
[13:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> We want to be able to show the tags for the previous versions though, even if they're different.
[13:26:44] <nacin> show, sure, but not use?
[13:27:15] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not use.
[13:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> Other than being able to get to the tag archive.
[13:27:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/foo/0.0.5/
[13:28:26] <nacin> So, I see a few solutions.
[13:29:28] <nacin> one, we can change the term counting logic to only look for plugins with post_parent = 0
[13:29:48] <nacin> that's actually not too painful.
[13:31:58] <nacin> another separate thing you'd have to keep in mind is actually exclude the older versions from tag archives.
[13:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> We're already doing that.
[13:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> You'll never find an old version of a plugin without explicitly choosing it from the latest version.
[13:33:18] <scott_gonzalez> 	if ( $query->is_main_query() && ($query->is_search() || $query->is_tag()) ) {
[13:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> 		$query->set( 'post_type', 'jquery_plugin' );
[13:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> 		$query->set( 'post_parent', 0 );
[13:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> 	}
[13:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> So let's just change the counting logic.

[13:42:23] <jquicommit> 13jqueryui.com/06master 14fedcde7 15Scott Gonz√°lez: Download all: Corrected description of zips.
[13:43:11] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: got it.
[17:08:58] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: about the "deprecated" sub-categories. Should we just slug them as "deprecated-1.x" to avoid the problem with duplicating the version "1.x" category slugs?
[17:10:23] <scott_gonzalez> I guess so, unless nacin knows a way to avoid this issue.
[17:14:19] <nacin> version slugs should probably be a separate version taxonomy
[17:14:24] <nacin> or deprecation should be a separate taxonomy
[17:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, well, there's that. But we like to use our big hammer :-)
[17:18:05] <nacin> would be fairly trivial to do.
[17:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> It'd actually be nice if we could get the XSL to be smart enough to automatically add that info based on the existing data.
[17:18:15] <nacin> just to confirm, plugin tags use the generic post_tag taxonomy?
[17:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: correct
[17:19:27] <nacin> okay. not entirely supported what I'm about to do, but it'll work just fine.
[17:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[17:21:48] <nacin> post type is jquery_plugin?
[17:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[17:27:12] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/4535206
[17:28:30] <nacin> activated on just the plugins site should handle the counting
[17:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> What's $object_types?
[17:29:28] <kswedberg> nacin, scott_gonzalez : what would have to be done to make deprecation a separate taxonomy?
[17:29:53] <kswedberg> nacin, every time I type your name, OS X tries to autocorrect it to niacin.
[17:30:02] <nacin> kswedberg: do 'n' + tab
[17:30:05] <nacin> :-)
[17:30:22] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: just a list of post types that the taxonomy is assigned to
[17:30:37] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: we could cut out some of that logic if you expect tags to only ever be used for plugins on the plugins site
[17:30:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it'll always be limited to plugins.
[17:31:08] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like if we're going to hijack this, we may as well cut out a lot of the normal logic :-)
[17:32:06] <nacin> updated
[17:32:31] <nacin> the "proper" way to do this would be to just create a separate taxonomy, I guess. we don't really support changing flags on core taxonomies, for YMMV reasons.
[17:32:34] <nacin> but this will always work.
[17:33:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[17:34:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'll test this out in a minute.
[17:34:35] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: As far as creating new taxonomies for version/deprecated, we just need to pass slightly different data to WordPress.
[17:34:49] <scott_gonzalez> We'd also need to create the new taxonomies up front.
[17:36:03] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: We'd define the taxonomy in a mu-plugin and then add the terms via XML-RPC, correct?
[17:36:36] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: ok. think you can tackle that?
[17:37:07] <scott_gonzalez> We'd need to do some additional stuff like changing the sidebar.
[17:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> We'd also break existing URLs for the version categories.
[17:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably 301 them.
[17:37:49] <kswedberg> oh, why couldn't we keep the version categories as is
[17:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, we can.
[17:38:23] <scott_gonzalez> So you just want deprecation as a new taxonomy?
[17:38:30] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: correct re: mu-plugin
[17:38:37] <kswedberg> yeah, seems easiest.
[17:38:51] <kswedberg> why would URLs have to change for version categories anyway?
[17:39:05] <scott_gonzalez> If we were making version into a new taxonomy as well.
[17:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> Then /category/version/ -> /version/
[17:39:25] <nacin> and that's something that could be redirected, too.
[17:39:40] <nacin> even /version/ is still weird, it's more of an /introduced/
[17:39:53] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[17:40:06] <nacin> version should really be an intersection of introduced and deprecated
[17:40:09] <nacin> and that's totally possible, too.
[17:40:11] <kswedberg> oh, right! I forgot we had that /category/ segment in there
[17:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> We use added/deprecated/removed for the data we show on the page.
[17:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> Well, core uses removed, in UI we just remove it :-P
[17:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> UI has actual versioned docs though; core doesn't.
[17:41:41] <kswedberg> hmm. could the deprecated/removed categories be automagically generated if the <deprecated>  tag is in the xml?
[17:42:33] <kswedberg> and only methods that are completely deprecated/removed should get the category, right? Not if just one signature is deprecated.
[17:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'd like to get to that point.
[17:45:19] <scott_gonzalez> And yes, only tag it deprecated if the whole thing is deprecated, otherwise it'll confuse users.
[17:45:56] <kswedberg> good good
[17:50:58] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Doesn't seem like that function is being called.
[17:51:17] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, does this only happen when a tag is added/removed?
[17:51:25] <nacin> yes
[17:51:33] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll go manually change something :-)
[17:52:18] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't seem to work.
[17:52:26] <scott_gonzalez> I went into the admin and added a tag to a plugin.
[17:52:35] <nacin> I'll play with it and evaluate.
[17:52:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[17:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..actually it is doing something.
[17:54:35] <scott_gonzalez> I had added a tag, but didn't hit update.
[17:54:35] <nacin> seems like it works to me.
[17:54:50] <scott_gonzalez> But now I'm not getting any results.
[17:55:18] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[17:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> jquery_plugin, not jquery-plugin
[17:55:26] <nacin> ah.
[17:55:32] <scott_gonzalez> So, it's working :-)
[17:55:34] <nacin> woo.
[17:56:48] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, gonna commit this.

[18:00:41] <nacin> oh man, I know nothing
[18:00:46] <nacin> I submitted a random PR
[18:01:03] <scott_gonzalez> oh, haha
[18:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[18:01:16] <nacin> I thought I did, dunno
[18:01:19] <nacin> willll just delete my fork
[18:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like you have to do all the building outside of WordPress?
[18:01:59] <nacin> I didn't like it when I first saw it. My OCD kicked in and did something.
[18:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> I thought that maybe there was some magic going on, but now I'm thinking there is not.
[18:02:08] <nacin> no magic at all.
[18:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[18:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'll pretend I never even saw it :-P
[18:02:36] <nacin> forking != endorsement? :-)
[18:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:03:04] <scott_gonzalez> I sometimes use forks in place of stars.
[18:52:51] <danheberden> probably a dumb question
[18:52:55] <danheberden> but if i commit this jquery.com stuff
[18:52:58] <danheberden> it won't go live, right?
[18:53:00] <danheberden> unless i were to tag it
[18:53:14] <danheberden> and it'll be viewable at stage.jquery.com?
[19:02:59] <danheberden> it's actually looking real http://danheberden.com/share/93021af.png
[19:05:46] <danheberden> ajpiano rworth et all: are we planning on keeping the "who's using jQuery" thingy?
[19:07:16] <ajpiano> danheberden: correct, it won't go live
[19:07:19] <ajpiano> viewable at stage
[19:07:27] <ajpiano> i donno, i don't think it's necessarily...necessary
[19:09:41] <danheberden> it feels like fluff
[19:11:57] <ajpiano> confirm
[19:20:04] <danheberden> oh no
[19:21:36] <ajpiano> ?
[19:26:32] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/4e8ec.png
[19:26:45] <danheberden> also i can't get vim to change to 8char tabs
[19:26:50] <danheberden> why must jQ be so diff :/
[19:26:55] <danheberden> you kids i swear
[19:26:55] <danheberden> haha
[19:28:49] <ajpiano> danheberden: set tabstop=8 softtabstop=8 sw=8 noexpandtab
[19:28:57] <ajpiano> danheberden: and throw html through here http://dirtymarkup.com/
[19:29:19] <ajpiano> if you can't get it to auto-indent properly in vim
[19:31:27] <danheberden> ajpiano: yay!
[19:31:28] <danheberden> thanks yous
[19:37:22] <danheberden> ajpiano: so i'm cool to start obliterating master?
[19:37:40] <danheberden> should i make a legacy branch?
[20:09:00] <ajpiano> danheberden: +1 to legacy branch, +1 to obliterating master
[20:09:22] <ajpiano> as long as what you have is basically servicable, it should be fine on master

[20:32:04] <danheberden> and is that automatically invoked?
[20:35:39] <danheberden> gah, ok, so i want to have some code samples on jquery.com, but it'd make so much sense to have them in markdown
[20:35:51] <danheberden> but of course the top bar is unique enough to require html
[20:36:04] <DaveMethvin> hey ajpiano danheberden if you have the chance I have a draft blog post for you guys: http://blog.jquery.com/?p=2419&preview=true&preview_id=2419&public=1&nonce=2c50f45bf5
[20:36:16] <DaveMethvin> the release files are already in place
[20:37:16] <DaveMethvin> the version will need an update on jquery.com when we post the blog
[20:38:13] <DaveMethvin> i will need to post the blog before 6am pacific, that's when my plane leaves sfo
[20:40:37] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: i don't think it likes your comments: http://danheberden.com/share/0e1fda5.png
[20:42:10] <DaveMethvin> oh duh, hadn't gotten down tha far
[20:42:14] <DaveMethvin> thanks, i'll fix it
[20:52:26] <ajpiano> danheberden: it works
[20:52:27] <ajpiano> 100%
[20:52:29] <ajpiano> on markdown or html
[20:52:39] <ajpiano> it's automatically invoked
[20:52:48] <ajpiano> any <pre><code> or fenced codeblock in markdown
[21:31:13] <danheberden> ajpiano: you think this is too zealous? http://danheberden.com/share/3284.png

[21:32:44] <ajpiano> though i see where you're going
[21:32:57] <danheberden> yeah, i was assuming it'd be so simple and sexy
[21:33:03] <danheberden> and then i wrote it and was like "oh, well... fuck"
[21:34:42] <danheberden> maybe just without the explanations?
[21:36:21] <ajpiano> yeah, possibly

[21:43:59] <ajpiano> never get a 3rd party keyboard drawer
[21:44:04] <ajpiano> that's what i've learend

[22:17:31] <danheberden> i bet it's getting that wordpress-sync error because the theme isn't registered properly
[22:17:47] <danheberden> i couldn't get 'pageTemplate' to work until i obliterated the db
[22:17:55] <danheberden> and then that error on grunt went away
[22:20:17] <ajpiano> there isn't a pageTemplate metadata on index.html

[22:27:37] <danheberden> interesting
[22:27:46] <danheberden> so you didn't have any theme upgrade issues?
[22:27:51] <danheberden> like - your wp admin shows all is ok
[22:27:52] <danheberden> ?
[22:28:08] <ajpiano> indeed
[22:30:28] <ajpiano> both stage and local seem to be able to find the right theem
[22:37:05] <danheberden> oh what did you do?
[22:37:13] <danheberden> nevermind i'm retarded

[22:59:12] <danheberden> ajpiano: fix it?
[22:59:13] <ajpiano> i haven't figured out how to actually save that as a shortcut
[22:59:17] <danheberden> oh, heh
[22:59:19] <danheberden> well TADA!
[22:59:22] <ajpiano> so i have been manually typing that out for like, since ever
[22:59:27] <ajpiano> also yeah i fixed it, bout to commit
[22:59:28] <danheberden> oh wow
[22:59:31] <danheberden> edit that .vimrc son
[22:59:37] <ajpiano> i wanted like simple shortcuts for it

[23:03:28] <ajpiano> hey now stage is working right tooooooooooo
[23:03:49] <ajpiano> danheberden: so basically we have http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/grid.php in our css framework
[23:04:04] <ajpiano> and the entire content-wrapper is a class="row"
[23:04:10] <ajpiano> so we can nest columns as deeply as we want
[23:04:18] <ajpiano> so any time we need to lay out shit horizontally, we can just use that
[23:05:03] <ajpiano> plus for shit like the button or centering text, there's some stuff in the framework for that as well http://stage.contribute.jquery.org/markup-conventions/
[23:05:21] <ajpiano> as to why stage worked, i have no idea :p
[23:06:15] <ajpiano> sorry if i inadvertently destroyed anything, i'm pretty sure it's mostly the same as it was
[23:06:18] <ajpiano> just with less custom css
[23:07:30] <danheberden> i really appreciate you doing that ajpiano
[23:07:41] <danheberden> as for the staging - if it WAS hitting that sync error, grunt needed to be ran again
[23:07:49] <danheberden> and committing the download stuff would have done that
[23:07:58] <danheberden> i'll review your changes

[23:08:10] <ajpiano> no prob man, i'm sure scott_gonzalez also appreciates me doing that :p
[23:08:16] <danheberden> haha
[23:08:39] <danheberden> i wasn't sure if i had to worry about it with a complete custom thingy
[23:08:41] <danheberden> but this helps
[23:08:45] <ajpiano> i still don't think it's perfect yet but that's a separate discussion
[23:08:52] <ajpiano> yeah thre's always gonna be some custom stuff here and there
[23:08:53] <danheberden> granted, most of my time was on the art 'n actually thinking of what to put there
[23:08:58] <ajpiano> but the more you can use framework stuff the better
[23:09:02] <ajpiano> yeah, ovi
[23:09:04] <ajpiano> obvi
[23:09:05] <danheberden> yeah, it's at least there to, like, poke at
[23:09:15] <ajpiano> yeah
[23:09:22] <danheberden> lol http://danheberden.com/share/866415e.png
[23:09:25] <ajpiano> i can still see us doing a "who's using jquery" maybe in the right sidebar
[23:09:34] <ajpiano> but not necessarily just companies, maybe other open source libs that rely on jquery
[23:09:39] <danheberden> so we are using the background image?
[23:09:46] <danheberden> i am so confused - i read like 4 times no images
[23:09:46] <ajpiano> yeah
[23:09:48] <danheberden> no gradients
[23:09:57] <danheberden> like,i asked confirmation
[23:10:01] <ajpiano> ohhh
[23:10:07] <danheberden> and the button is all goofed up
[23:10:08] <ajpiano> we were definiteyl talking about different areas of the website
[23:10:12] <danheberden> oh wells
[23:10:14] <ajpiano> hmm that is weird
[23:10:16] <danheberden> oh
[23:10:18] <danheberden> haha
[23:10:39] <danheberden> it's so nice to see jquery.com on the main theme
[23:10:43] <ajpiano> yeah the no gradients/images of gradients, i was talking about on div#container
[23:10:57] <danheberden> ohhhh
[23:10:59] <ajpiano> #banner-secondary always has that special grey with the little boxes made of ticky tacky
[23:10:59] <danheberden> shit son
[23:11:04] <danheberden> i can go back to the drawing board
[23:11:08] <danheberden> i was gonna do such cool shit
[23:11:11] <ajpiano> yeah, it's a relief
[23:11:12] <danheberden> though the simple is pretty hot
[23:11:25] <danheberden> i like ticky tacky
[23:11:30] <ajpiano> after a while of working on this, the old jquery.com starts to look really jarring
[23:11:31] <ajpiano> yeah
[23:11:41] <ajpiano> and then in terms of re-adding a gradient, taht would also be on div#continer
[23:12:12] <danheberden> this grid is harder on resizing http://danheberden.com/share/fa4f5b.png
[23:12:41] <danheberden> i just was gonna use one on the download box
[23:12:43] <ajpiano> oh hm there's a weird no-mans-land
[23:12:46] <danheberden> but i like the flat color
