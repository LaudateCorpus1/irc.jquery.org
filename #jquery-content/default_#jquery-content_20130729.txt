[07:17:52] <ajpiano> agcolom: gseguin|away what's wrong with http://jquerymobile.com/resources/
[07:28:15] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano I asked that on Saturday.  We weren't sure.  I pinged gnarf to look into it but I don't think I got a reply. 
[07:29:46] <arschmitz> im looking at it right now
[07:29:56] <arschmitz> that folder is set to execute only not read execute
[07:33:14] <arschmitz> ajpiano: except changing that did not fix so im not sure ....
[07:33:34] <ajpiano> you guys haven't pushed any new wordpress stuff live or anything, right?c
[07:33:44] <ajpiano> cause "resources" is a reserved path in jquery-wp-content i think
[07:39:43] <arschmitz> ajpiano: that i could not tell you i dont really do anything with wordpress
[07:39:52] <arschmitz> agcolom: do you know?
[07:58:29] <agcolom> ajpiano: Is that what you're calling the "feedburner" page?
[07:58:40] <ajpiano> no, that' sa different problem
[07:58:50] <ajpiano> unrelated
[07:58:55] <agcolom> ok
[08:02:31] <agcolom> I think the resources folder on jquerymobile.com may have only been created on friday... we looked at moving all the zip files out of the cdn, and since on ui the structure is resources/download/version.zip and that is what it will be on the new site, we decided to make that structure on the current site so that the blog posts pointing to the wrong location only had to be changed once. I'm suspecting that 
[08:02:31] <agcolom> this folder did not exist before and just got a 711 or 701 when being created?
[08:03:28] <arschmitz> agcolom: it was 751
[08:04:09] <agcolom> 751? that is strange! 
[08:04:20] <agcolom> how about download?
[08:04:38] <arschmitz> but its 755 now and still does not work but if its a reserved path in Wordpress that could probably cause
[08:06:15] <arschmitz> agcolom: oh also /resources/ pointed to the resources wordpress page before and now there is a folder of the same name in root
[08:06:32] <agcolom> ok! :-(
[08:06:54] <arschmitz> so i think the folder needs a different name
[08:07:25] <agcolom> yes, that's probably because of the resources page 
[08:07:54] <arschmitz> yeah which should stay /resources/ because thats what it has always been
[08:09:15] <agcolom> yes, we discussed that at some point a while ago, because on the new site, we need the resources folder and either find a new name for the page or have a way to deal with it...
[08:10:15] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: ajpiano: do you know how this will work on the new site? ^ 
[08:10:51] <ajpiano> i am not 100% sure
[08:11:36] <ajpiano> i can't remember if we decided to move the resources somewhere else just for jqm.com, or to move the current resources page somewhere else and try to redirect it
[08:12:36] <RWhitbeck> This was the previous discussion on the matter https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/issues/3
[08:12:36] <b-ot> RWhitbeck: Issue #3 by ajpiano (6mon 2w ago): "Resources" page needs to be renamed
[08:15:23] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: Thanks :-)
[08:15:49] <agcolom> so is there an issue on the current site about this?
[08:15:50] <ajpiano> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/%23jquery-meeting_20130131.log.html#t10:16:19
[08:16:01] <ajpiano> apparently we'll need to do a redirect
[08:16:29] <ajpiano> or some other kind of proxy....
[08:18:03] <jqcommit> [13jquery-wp-content] 15scottgonzalez closed pull request #249: New styles for jquerymobile.com theme (06master...06jquerymobile.com)  02http://git.io/VXUE2g
[08:19:23] <agcolom> so how come this works on the new site but not on the old site?
[08:20:41] <ajpiano> i am not sure how we are redirecting to the old site from the main jquery-wp-content, if at all
[08:20:53] <ajpiano> but if we are, then it is probably getting tripped up on the new resources directory
[08:20:55] <ajpiano> that was created
[08:23:33] <agcolom> ok I can change the last blog post if we want to change the location of the zip files for now.
[08:24:27] <arschmitz> agcolom: want me to rename the directory and see if it fixes it?
[08:24:34] <agcolom> yes
[08:24:38] <agcolom> please :-)
[08:24:53] <arschmitz> ok
[08:25:11] <agcolom> say try jus resource instead of resources
[08:25:21] <agcolom> (so it's easy to change the posts)
[08:25:37] <arschmitz> ok
[08:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> You're going to host demos for each version on jquerymobile.com?
[08:26:13] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ^
[08:26:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: that folder is just for the zips i think agcolom is that right?
[08:26:44] <agcolom> there's also demos...
[08:27:01] <agcolom> but I have no idea about that one. 
[08:27:45] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: yes, each version has it's own demos on view.jquerymobile.com/
[08:27:49] <arschmitz> demos should just redirect to view 
[08:27:52] <agcolom> I only mentioned it because I saw that the blog posts mention it... so thought that we need to bear it in mind depending on what it is we do with it
[08:30:43] <arschmitz> ok resources is working again
[08:30:53] <arschmitz> agcolom: ajpiano: RWhitbeck: ^^^
[08:31:15] <agcolom> ok ,so what is the folder name?
[08:31:25] <arschmitz> resource like you asked for
[08:31:39] <ajpiano> what did you change ?
[08:31:46] <agcolom> ok, thanks :-) so I will change the blog post
[08:31:59] <arschmitz> ajpiano: just renamed the resources folder to resource
[08:32:09] <arschmitz> so it did not conflict with the wordpress page
[08:32:34] <agcolom> posts and will change them again when we move to the new site...
[08:33:54] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: We can't rename the directory.
[08:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Don't change the posts again.
[08:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> The URL cannot change from /resources/*
[08:34:29] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: this is for our old current site its a directory gseguin just made on friday 
[08:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Yes, I know.
[08:34:50] <scott_gonzalez> The URL was chosen specifically not to break when moving to the new site.
[08:34:51] <agcolom> holding on...
[08:35:06] <arschmitz> oh well it broke the current site ....
[08:35:24] <scott_gonzalez> So we need to fix that.
[08:35:30] <scott_gonzalez> But not by changing the URLs.
[08:37:42] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: ok well im not much of a wordpress person so no idea how to properly resolve those urls 
[08:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> Is this in /var/www/jquerymobile.com on eol2?
[08:39:45] <arschmitz> yes
[08:40:20] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...is this nginx?
[08:40:24] <arschmitz> nope
[08:40:33] <arschmitz> good old apache and .htaccess
[08:40:44] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see .htaccess.
[08:40:57] <arschmitz> its there in the htdocs folder
[08:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I didn't notice that it's not grouping dot files together.
[08:42:50] <arschmitz> yeah good old alphabetical 
[08:42:58] <arschmitz> minus the dot
[08:45:31] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: just going to redirect /resources/ to wordpress and let everything else fall through to dir?
[08:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> What's a URL that should work for an actual resource?
[08:46:03] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: http://jquerymobile.com/resources/download/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-alpha.1.zip
[08:47:06] <gseguin> did I mess something up?
[08:47:28] <arschmitz> gseguin: the folder resources just conflicts with the wordpress page resources
[08:47:34] <gseguin> wait that was working on Saturday
[08:47:48] <gseguin> ah shite
[08:48:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, it's fixed.
[08:48:44] <gseguin> what was it scott_gonzalez?
[08:48:51] <scott_gonzalez> rewrites
[08:49:01] <scott_gonzalez>  /resources/ is a special URL.
[08:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> But only in new sites.
[08:49:13] <gseguin> ok
[08:49:24] <scott_gonzalez> You can't just randomly place files on a WordPress server and have them work ;-)
[08:50:48] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: thank you :-)

[13:51:36] <gnarf> jdorfman: waiting for some funds to end up in our account for ssl :)
[13:51:49] <gnarf> jdorfman: so just CNAME it to that netdna addr?
[13:52:14] <jdorfman> correcto
[13:52:26] <jdorfman> gnarf: it is a push of a button for us
[13:52:39] <jdorfman> no need to buy one, we are partners with GlobalSign
[13:53:05] <gnarf> oh - hrm
[13:53:16] <gnarf> well if you want to install one for code - that works
[13:53:16] <jdorfman> your call just giving you a heads up
[13:53:20] <gnarf> i still need to buy one
[13:53:23] <jdorfman> k
[13:53:25] <gnarf> for *.jquery.com anyway
[13:53:39] <jdorfman> once the dns propagates I can install the cert via GlobalSign
[13:53:55] <gnarf> but it makes sense to let you guys control the SSL for the code.jquery.com
[13:55:09] <jdorfman> yeah more secure
[14:02:49] <gnarf> jdorfman: in the realm of random questions - is there a way i can get a report of 404's on the new site after we launch it? I want to make sure we aren't completely breaking the internet ya know :)

[14:05:13] <jdorfman> you can create a nagios alert with that
