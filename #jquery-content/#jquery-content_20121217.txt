[12:49:18] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: We don't have mockups of sites for new-css, do we?
[12:49:55] <rworth> scott_gonzalez we do not. When new-css was created, only the jquery.org pages were done, and there were done as implementation
[12:51:16] <rworth> existing sites (making the switch without causing major regressions) should be a good enough reference at this stage, and is what I'm using
[12:51:35] <rworth> not that that answers everything, but that's what I'm waiting on nate to fill in on
[12:52:39] <rworth> also, today is moving day (truck loading anyway), so a bit afk, but should get some time each night/morning the rest of this week
[12:58:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we didn't have mockups to work from for jqueryui.com
[12:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess we're sticking with our custom design?
[12:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> Loading trucks sucks. Did you hire laborers?
[13:06:12] <agcolom> hi, has the learn site been launched yet officially?
[13:06:52] <agcolom> ajpiano: ^ 
[13:07:20] <ajpiano> not yet agcolom
[13:07:36] <agcolom> ok. do you know when it might launch?
[13:08:08] <agcolom> (I'm not in a hurry, just seeing how to be fit things I need to do :-) )
[13:08:20] <agcolom> best ^ (not be!)
[13:09:49] <ajpiano> i want to just get the rest of the content in contribute.jquery.com fleshed out abit more and then announce at same time
[13:09:55] <ajpiano> so hopefully like the 1st week of 2012
[13:13:22] <agcolom> 2013 :-) ^?
[13:14:01] <agcolom> great! I'd like to add one tutorial on how to use the JQM Theme Roller, so that's good timing :-)
[13:14:51] <agcolom> I'll try to add some pictures to that one too...
[13:42:06] <ajpiano> yeah, 2013
[13:42:10] <ajpiano> agcolom: awesome
[14:03:05] <rworth> scott_gonzalez my wife packed all the boxes but yeah we hired people to put all the furniture and boxes in the truck
[14:03:51] <rworth> scott_gonzalez yeah, I'll be happy if we just get the markup and css updated underneath the existing design. Then we can look at polishing all the designs in the Feb-Mar timeframe
