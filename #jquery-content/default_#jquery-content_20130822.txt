[07:26:58] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I think we need to contact a company and tell them to stop having people publish plugins in a workshop: http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=nurun
[07:28:14] <ajpiano> hm
[07:28:20] <ajpiano> it may have been a one time thing, i can't tell
[07:28:44] <ajpiano> it doesn't look like they like, are a company that regularly leads workshops
[07:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I can't tell.
[07:28:57] <ajpiano> http://www.nurun.com/what-we-do
[07:29:16] <ajpiano> seems like maybe it was internal workshop day
[07:29:27] <ajpiano> seems safe to delete them
[07:29:47] <ajpiano> we could e-mail the maintainers
[07:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> They're just junk hello world plugins.
[07:30:37] <ajpiano> yup
[07:30:54] <ajpiano> popo is cool though
[07:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> heh
