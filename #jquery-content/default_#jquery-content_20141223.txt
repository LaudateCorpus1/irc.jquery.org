[06:43:11] <gnarf> arthurvr: hey - thanks for the quick responses, sorry noone has been really on top of the queues in a lot of these places
[06:43:50] <gnarf> arthurvr: out of curiosity, are there any issues you want me to take a look at so long as I'm going through these? (been sorting by least recently updated and hunting through the docs repos)
[06:44:14] <gnarf> this is what I apparently find a "vacation" :)
[06:46:26] <arthurvr> Hi gnarf! feel free to go ahead as you like‚Ä¶ If I want you to look at shomething I‚Äôil ping you ;-)
[06:46:51] <gnarf> arthurvr: also http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/#commit-guidelines - would save me a reword during rebase :)
[06:47:22] <arthurvr> yeah.. I started doing with last PRs, but will think about it.
[06:48:02] <arthurvr> I mostly don‚Äôt include ‚Äòfixes‚Äô closes ‚Äòcloses‚Äô or refs in my forks because when prs get merged you get double references in the original issues than
[06:48:11] <gnarf> it's okay, usually needs a rebase anyway to add "closes" to it - not terribly difficult and ^^^
[06:49:46] <arthurvr> Btw, as you‚Äôre going over old PRs and issues‚Ä¶ If there is something you want my help with feel free to just ask
[06:51:15] <jqcommit> [13learn.jquery.com] 15gnarf closed issue #276: article on index() - index() with no arg now implicitly calls first() not last from jQuery 1.91 02http://git.io/dpELOQ
[06:55:05] <arthurvr> gnarf: Just interested, but do you guys still do a jquery-content meeting?
[06:56:10] <gnarf> arthurvr: there haven't been any lately, there hasn't been much of a team - cc danheberden agcolom RWhitbeck ajpiano 
[06:56:46] <gnarf> arthurvr: but like - we should be doing them, and we do need some community help here - also cc kswedberg_ ^^
[06:57:27] <arthurvr> just interested because I didn‚Äôt want to miss it, but if there aren‚Äôt any ‚Ä¶
[06:57:30] <gnarf> Perhaps we should send out a doodle over the next few weeks in IRC to see when would be the best time for a weekly?
[06:57:53] <arthurvr> It‚Äôs defenitly a good thing to do, so why not?
[06:58:34] <arthurvr> I already commented in github issues, but it just can‚Äôt be PRs for typos stay open for months
[06:59:30] <kswedberg_> arthurvr: agreed. I keep thinking I'm going to have more time...right around the corner. But instead I find I have less and less. 
[07:00:14] <kswedberg_> Which isn't an excuse. It's more a lame attempt at an apology. :)
[07:00:21] <arthurvr> I have time too much now, but there are other times of the year. I understand that ;-)
[07:04:28] <kswedberg_> The other thing is, I'm bad at managing issues when I ask someone to sign the CLA or fix a typo or something. I totally lose track of the issue and don't see whether the person has done so. So much noise.
[07:05:22] <arthurvr> of course, but that‚Äôs a thing in every repo.
[07:06:09] <kswedberg_> true
[07:06:39] <arthurvr> maybe add labels like ‚ÄùCLA needed‚Äù
[07:06:50] <arthurvr> which I saw some issues doing that
[07:06:54] <arthurvr> but surely not all
[07:06:56] <kswedberg_> that's a good idea! yeah.
[07:07:30] <arthurvr> Btw for typos it‚Äôs mostly quicker to do it just yourself.
[07:07:36] <arthurvr> but that comes over bad
[07:08:36] <arthurvr> in api. there is a label actually
[07:08:45] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22needs+CLA+signature%22
[07:08:51] <arthurvr> but nothing is assigned to it
[07:10:45] <gnarf> arthurvr: we are working on an automated checker done hopefully "soon‚Ñ¢" cc scott_gonzalez 
[07:11:02] <arthurvr> Which is awesome
[07:11:13] <gnarf> right now you can help check them
[07:11:24] <gnarf> arschmitz has an extension for chrome that lets you run a check
[07:11:41] <arthurvr> Really? nice‚Ä¶ Let me see
[07:13:34] <gnarf> arthurvr: http://cl.ly/image/2N0s170L402p
[07:13:50] <gnarf> arschmitz: i don't remember how i installed this thing, can you help us out with some install instructions? )
[07:13:50] <arthurvr> that‚Äôs awesome‚Ä¶ downloading it
[07:13:57] <arthurvr> found it ;-)
[07:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license :-)
[07:16:04] <arthurvr> https://www.dropbox.com/s/snhnhdk79peu62q/Screenshot%202014-12-23%2016.16.02.png?dl=0
[07:16:43] <scott_gonzalez> Was just catching up on emails, then I was going to ping you about getting this set up on a repo to test it out.
[07:16:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: cool
[07:16:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez do you have a manual "run against a pr" bin yet?
[07:17:09] <gnarf> like could i test locally on my machine against a pr?
[07:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> Not yet, but you could just send a fake payload ;-)
[07:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> Want me to throw together a gist for you?
[07:17:50] <gnarf> i think it might be easier to write a bin ;)
[07:18:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, sure, just as an actual bin.
[07:18:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do that now.
[07:18:39] <gnarf> bin/pr.js api.jquery.com 585
[07:18:41] <gnarf> or something
[07:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, comfing right up.
[07:22:53] <gnarf> could test with learn.jquery.com 581
[07:24:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: also - for a silly output we could probably use puthtml 
[07:29:27] <arthurvr> Now I‚Äôm able to check if people signed the CLA, could I help here and there by pinging people that didn‚Äôt sign it already? If that‚Äôs helpful I‚Äôd love too.
[07:33:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Ok, this is working, but I just found a problem I'm going to need to fix with setting the status when there's an error.
[07:34:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: in the meantime before we have a details page
[07:34:33] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/581 :-)
[07:34:39] <gnarf> can you change the description to have the reason?
[07:34:41] <arschmitz> gnarf: hey sorry catching up yeah i can help with that
[07:35:58] <arschmitz> arthurvr: for people that need to sign the CLA we generally just ping them in the issue to sign and yes thats actually very helpful 
[07:36:20] <arthurvr> Perfect. already started.
[07:36:26] <gnarf> also worth mentioning that the name and email on the commit needs to match
[07:36:37] <arschmitz> Yes for sure
[07:36:40] <arthurvr> Okay.

[07:47:43] <arschmitz> arthurvr: Just so that you know not only does the name need to match but it needs to be a real name not a screen name
[07:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license#pr-auditing second paragraph
[07:48:26] <arthurvr> I know. Where the extension said it‚Äôs an invalid name I commented it.
[07:48:59] <gnarf> there are a few exceptions
[07:49:44] <arschmitz> arthurvr: cool ( i actually forgot it checked that lol ) 
[07:52:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: if you got one more feature in ya - audit-pr learn.jquery.com open ? :)
[07:54:20] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, sure wouldn't be too hard.
[07:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> Just filing issues for everything before I lose track of this stuff ;-)
[07:57:10] <scott_gonzalez> Well, honestly, it probably won't be too useful for learn right now.
[07:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> There are only 22 open and arthurvr has marked at least half by now :-P
[07:57:35] <arthurvr> in learn it‚Äôs done.
[07:57:40] <scott_gonzalez> There you go :-P
[07:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> Doing this "right" requires a bit of re-org (which I expected, I just wanted to get a minimal viable product out).
[07:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> But I can keep working on this stuff today.
[07:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Feel free to add more to this list: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license/issues
[07:59:38] <scott_gonzalez> You can also send me your preferred priority for those.
[08:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna step away for a bit.
[08:05:20] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-license/issues/4 seems pretty important :)
[08:06:52] <arthurvr> Side: this hole discussion in here kinda showed the need to do a content meeting again
[08:07:31] <gnarf> I agree, and also think it's going to be post holi-daze
[08:07:58] <gnarf> also, going to go afk myself for a bit
[08:08:05] <arthurvr> that‚Äôs logical. Just wanted to point it out.
