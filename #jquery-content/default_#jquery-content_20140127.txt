[06:37:24] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like most icons for API categories won't actually be very helpful.
[06:42:39] <ajpiano> i don't think it's imperative that we do

[11:32:10] <dcherman> is there an XML/JSON api available that just enumerates all released versions of jQuery ( including beta and RCs? )?  pretty much like http://code.jquery.com/jquery/, just not in HTML

[11:58:16] <scott_gonzalez> dcherman: Nothing official, but you could hack one together ;-)
[11:59:04] <scott_gonzalez> What would you use it for?
[12:00:19] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano kswedberg gnarf jzaefferer arschmitz agcolom tj_vantoll1 uGoMobi: Can you please weigh in on https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/issues/54
[12:01:01] <dcherman> scott_gonzalez: i'm too lazy to keep going back to old github projects to test on each jquery release, so i wanted to automate running test suites whenever a beta/rc/final version is released.  actually did catch a bug in the last RC by doing that, so it seems worthwhile
[12:01:41] <dcherman> i just hacked up a quick script to scrape that page i linked, but wanted to see if there was any official API since that page's structure could change at any time of course
[12:01:52] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: done
[12:05:57] <gnarf> dcherman: why not just poll commits on https://github.com/jquery/code.jquery.com
[12:06:04] <gnarf> check the cdn/ folder for new jqueries ?
[12:06:24] <gnarf> sorry
[12:06:33] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com
[12:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't be opposed to generating a JSON file with all the versions and putting on the CDN.
[12:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> But I can't imagine it would get too much use.
[12:07:49] <gnarf> also dcherman: some of the code needed to get that list https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/blob/master/grunt.js#L96-L139
[12:08:00] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: we could very easily publish the json
[12:08:07] <gnarf> that we use to stuff the templates
[12:08:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[12:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> But we'd need to link to it to make it useful.
[12:09:21] <arschmitz> seems like it could be useful for anyone that tests against jquery versions
[12:09:27] <gnarf> code.jquery.com/versions.json 
[12:09:39] <arschmitz> which probably is not a ton but there are some for sure
[12:10:15] <dcherman> gnarf: ya, that's a sweet idea about commits btw, didn't think about polling github
[12:10:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the other thing - we'd have to be careful not to break the data format
[12:10:33] <gnarf> dcherman: every "release" has a corresponding commit to codeorigin.jquery.com 
[12:10:34] <gnarf> so
[12:11:09] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i also noticed just now
[12:11:32] <gnarf> that project is using grunt 0.3 for some reason
[12:11:41] <gnarf> should probably bump to 0.4
[12:12:21] <jqcommit> [13codeorigin.jquery.com] 15gnarf opened issue #9: Grunt 0.4.x 02http://git.io/rksHPA
[12:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> meh
[12:13:24] <scott_gonzalez> We don't really gain anything by upgrading.
[12:13:57] <gnarf> said everyone still using jQuery 1.4 ;)
[12:14:17] <ajpiano> isn't everything on 0.3.x still?
[12:14:20] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, codeorigin is a real WP site, right?
[12:14:31] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing using grunt-wordpress can use 0.4.x
[12:14:35] <ajpiano> ^^
[12:15:42] <jqcommit> [13codeorigin.jquery.com] 15scottgonzalez closed issue #9: Grunt 0.4.x 02http://git.io/rksHPA
[12:16:30] <gnarf> oh
[12:16:34] <gnarf> fun
[12:17:05] <gnarf> that would be a hell of an update i guess
[12:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I refuse to do it because of the huge uncertainty of Grunt's future API.
[12:21:16] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Looks like we're good to remove the CDN links in the footer.
[12:21:29] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want to do that?
