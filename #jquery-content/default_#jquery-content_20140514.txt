[05:38:22] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: For https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/452, what do you think about moving the sentence right after the new code example to right before the new sentence?
[05:38:41] <scott_gonzalez> So it would read "When you reference a global variable... In the following example..."
[05:45:33] <tj_vantoll> *looking*
[05:47:03] <tj_vantoll> I like it, but then the next example needs a new intro.
[05:48:23] <tj_vantoll> var myFunction = function() {
[05:48:23] <tj_vantoll>     var foo = "hello";
[05:48:23] <tj_vantoll>     var myFn = function() {
[05:48:23] <tj_vantoll>         console.log( foo );
[05:48:23] <tj_vantoll>     };
[05:48:23] <tj_vantoll>     foo = "world";
[05:48:23] <tj_vantoll>     return myFn;
[05:48:25] <tj_vantoll> };
[05:48:26] <tj_vantoll> var f = myFunction();
[05:48:26] <tj_vantoll> f(); // "world"
[05:51:50] <tj_vantoll> Here, the `myFn` function sees changes to the local `foo` variable, even after the invocation of `myFunction`.
[05:53:33] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe I'll just land the PR as is and then do the move and add that sentence.
[05:57:01] <tj_vantoll> Yeah I like that.

[07:11:15] <gnarf> hey scott_gonzalez - can you just make some edits on that article yourself rather than pile on little changes, unless github is the only thing you want to see different ;)
[07:11:39] <gnarf> I'd rather have each of us add a little something there anyway so its more accurate

[09:34:24] <jzaefferer> hi isaacdurazo :-) I'm looking for design help with a logo and color scheme for globalizejs.com, which we're putting together. Currently we have just the domain and the project on GitHub: https://github.com/jquery/globalize
[09:35:36] <isaacdurazo> jzaefferer awesome! are you guys gonna use the regular jQuery website theme?
[09:36:02] <isaacdurazo> just different logo and colors?
[09:37:53] <jzaefferer> Yeah, I think so. Kind of like http://qunitjs.com/ - purple and different logo (with and without text), but otherwise same design
[09:39:36] <isaacdurazo> alright jzaefferer that's what I was thinking. I was telling Kris, that I'll have time to work on this maybe by the end of next week or beginning of the following one
[09:39:40] <isaacdurazo> is that cool?
[09:41:39] <jzaefferer> Sure, sounds good. You can usually find me in here if you have any questions. 
[09:42:25] <isaacdurazo> great jzaefferer talk to you later!
