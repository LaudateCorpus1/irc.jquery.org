[08:22:35] <tonodera> is anyone here?
[08:29:42] <rworth> tonodera what's up?
[08:30:16] <tonodera> hi! rworth!
[08:31:02] <tonodera> I have a question for contribution about jQuery documentation
[08:34:38] <rworth> ask away
[08:35:54] <tonodera> I am a staff of Adways Inc., Japan.
[08:37:08] <tonodera> I have an idea to transrate your jQuery document on jquery.com to Japanese and want to open it to the public as web contents.
[08:38:36] <tonodera> I plan to run this idea as group working in one of our company's studyng program.
[08:39:00] <tonodera> So now I have some question;
[08:39:06] <rworth> it's a great idea. We've been working on a system to make this possible
[08:40:26] <tonodera> Could I run this idea? Could I ask you there are some problem ?
[08:46:36] <rworth> tonodera get started translating the files in https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/tree/master/pages
[08:47:02] <rworth> what we're still working on (and will keep working on) is where will the translated files live and how they'll be deployed to production
[08:47:26] <rworth> the same system will support translation of the other sites as well, such as api.jquery.com, etc.
[08:52:16] <tonodera> You mean we should transrate documents in the URL(githab.com) above first, dont you?
[08:53:21] <rworth> all pages that will be translated are in github, yes. see http://blog.jquery.com/2013/01/23/a-site-to-behold-open-content-design-comes-to-jquery-2/ and http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/
[08:54:36] <buritica> rworth: how will languages be namespaced? I was wondering the same for spanish content
[08:54:52] <rworth> buritica that's what we're still finalizing
[08:55:06] <rworth> our current plan is a repo per language, with subfolders for each site/domain
[08:55:16] <buritica> hmm, makes sense
[08:55:27] <rworth> then we can manage user permissions and PRs on a language basis
[09:12:57] <tonodera> At first I planned to make Japanese jQuery apl docs site on our web domain originaly, 
[09:13:10] <tonodera> But I understood you propose that we should transrate jQuery contents in github,
[09:13:20] <tonodera> and you are prepared to manage it.
[09:18:45] <tonodera> Is it correct?
[09:32:17] <rworth> we are not yet prepared to, but we are preparing to, yes
[09:34:27] <tonodera> OK.
[09:38:30] <tonodera> I think we would contribute your transration plan positively, when you prepared it to.
[09:47:45] <tonodera> I will read the blog contents and documents carefully.
[09:49:44] <tonodera> And I will chat to ask questions on here again when what I will have.
[09:50:11] <tonodera> Oops, sorry.  when I  wiil have them.
[10:05:56] <tonodera> thank you very much!

[13:43:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ping
[13:46:02] <kborchers> gnarf: I want to say scott_gonzalez was going to be out this week
[13:46:11] <gnarf> kborchers: oh damn
[13:46:16] <gnarf> all my plugins are broke ;)
[13:46:29] <gnarf> https://github.com/gnarf/
[13:47:32] <gnarf> http://plugins.jquery.com/ajaxQueue/
[13:47:37] <gnarf> still all pointing to @gnarf37
[13:47:46] <kborchers> ouch
[13:48:19] <gnarf> yeah, i expect some pain in the butts from that name change
[13:48:30] <gnarf> but now gnarf everywhere except gmail
[13:48:31] <gnarf> ;)
[13:48:38] <kborchers> that's nice
[13:49:41] <kborchers> gnarf: hmmm, everything seems to redirect on github for me
[13:50:05] <kborchers> not ideal but not broken from what i can tell
[13:51:26] <kborchers> gnarf: i think everything is based on tags for plugins, right? so maybe you need to update your package.json and tag?
[13:51:51] <gnarf> right, but that plugin is now tied to gnarf37/ in the sqllite db
[13:51:56] <gnarf> i know this much
[13:52:03] <kborchers> oh i see
[13:52:04] <kborchers> hmmm
[15:47:43] <s5fs> gnarf: i was planning on finishing up the plugins update process this week, i can look into your github info at the same time
[15:48:37] <s5fs> if i go another week of sleeping 5hrs/night i may just live like that forever
