[09:16:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can you push the wp-content commit to turn on codeorigin.jquery.com ?
[09:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[09:17:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: also - the "git block" for core didn't get updated in the /jquery/ - perhaps extract it ?
[09:18:00] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[09:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'll work on UI listings.
[10:03:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: back and working on infra part
[10:04:42] <gnarf> jdorfman: ping
[10:04:58] <gnarf> jdorfman: do you have an example script to request a reload?
[10:44:54] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I have the index moved to Handlebars now.
[10:45:00] <scott_gonzalez> Working on moving jquery.
[10:45:03] <scott_gonzalez> Then I'll start on UI.
[10:50:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ! yay

[10:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> Much better :-)
[11:14:52] * gnarf is still fighting with getting the try_files setup right
[11:16:00] <eddiemonge> Do. Or do not. There is no try
[12:55:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I might end up changing how the core files are parsed to make it possible to reuse some of this logic with other projects.
[12:57:34] <gnarf> i assumed that might happen
[12:57:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: having a brain exploding nginx issue
[13:12:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: think i found my way out of it
[13:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It might be a while before I have something to push, but I'll get it done tonight.
[13:22:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: any reason not to tag jquery-wp-content ?

[13:52:16] * gnarf shrugs
[13:52:16] <b-ot> gnarf: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[13:52:29] <gnarf> we were being fast and loose about access deleting that day
[13:52:30] <gnarf> :)
[14:05:32] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: rworth: at the bottom of https://jquery.com/ the CDN goes: "//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.1/jquery.min.js" should http be added so that this becomes a clickable link?
[14:08:32] <eddiemonge> https cert is broken
[14:08:49] <eddiemonge> agcolom: its meant to be like that so you can copy into your page
[14:08:58] <agcolom> oh, ok
[14:10:18] <eddiemonge> http://note.io/18FFEDa
[14:10:29] <eddiemonge> gnarf: ^^
[14:11:08] <gnarf> eddiemonge: its because you're getting the https server for jquery.org
[14:11:17] <gnarf> the sites don't support https (except org) currently
[14:11:24] <gnarf> but they all vhome on the same IP
[14:11:25] <gnarf> so ...
[14:11:45] <eddiemonge> redirect needed?

[14:23:10] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: No, it's intentionally protocol-less.
[14:23:17] <scott_gonzalez> The purpose is for them to copy, not to follow a link.
[14:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> Those two things are unrelated, BTW.
[14:25:06] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: but we have the protocol on ui and mobile (that's why I was asking)
[14:26:03] <agcolom> I just wanted to check that that was what we wanted...
[14:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, we should not have the protocol in any of them.
[14:27:54] <scott_gonzalez> Oh...
[14:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> Well, they're different actually.
[14:28:15] <scott_gonzalez> UI uses the jQuery CDN.
[14:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> It has to be HTTP.
[14:28:27] <scott_gonzalez> At least for a few more days ;-)
[14:28:44] <agcolom> oh, I see, the other one it's because it doesn't have to be http ?
[14:29:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the Google CDN is both HTTP and HTTPS.
[14:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> Not putting a protocol ensures that the URL will work for everyone.
[14:29:32] <agcolom> right. Great :-) thanks :-)
[14:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[14:29:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: p.s. - migrate's links seem to be broken - only shows "uncompressed" and it points at the min
[14:29:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: also - i think i'm as 'done' with the infra side of this as i can be
[14:30:07] <gnarf> sorry i pushed a commit in under you
[14:30:14] <gnarf> but it's a file that doesn't exist in the repo yet
[14:30:36] <gnarf> just a little purge script which i want jdorfman to rewrite to work with maxcdn: ^ http://git.io/nrRZ3w jdorfman
[14:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> Bah, ok, I'll fix migrate with the rest of the changes I'm making.
[14:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[14:31:22] <scott_gonzalez> Just don't touch existing files or I'll get crazy conflicts :-)
[14:31:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yup that's what i figured
[14:31:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: want me to stick around at all? i was thinking about starting the transit home
[14:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> Nah. I'm about to cut my hair, then work on this some more, then go run my JS meetup.
[14:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> Probably won't commit till after the meetup, so it'll be pretty late.
