[00:49:09] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez ^^ that more or less takes care of most styling for the events.jquery.org homepage
[00:49:43] <ajpiano> i also moved the dynamic menu stuff out of mu_plugins for events.jquery.org and moved it into the sitewide actions and made the events menu int he header dynamic
[00:49:49] <ajpiano> not sure if i did that quite right
[00:49:58] <ajpiano> but it's working which is the main point
[01:18:02] <ajpiano> yeah, it actually...isn't working right on other sites besides events so i'll need a hand w that
