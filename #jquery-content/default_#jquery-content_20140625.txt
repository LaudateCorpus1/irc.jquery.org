[05:56:15] <tj_vantoll> I'm looking for help answering a formatting question: https://gist.github.com/tjvantoll/db83d89b0bafbeecaefe. jQuery's docs are somewhat inconsistent on this as am I.
[06:00:14] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: I commented, I'm actually making very similar edits to the 1.11 upgrade guide right now.
[06:14:13] <tj_vantoll> scott_gonzalez: Thanks, and that's part of the reason why I asked. I agree with your reasoning.
