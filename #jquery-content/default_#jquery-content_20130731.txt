[00:53:46] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: OMG I've fixed the file size issue!!!!!! 
[00:54:28] <agcolom> I did 2 things... not sure which of the to fixed it... I am soooooo happy!!!!!! :-)
[00:57:31] <agcolom> oh, and narrowed it down. The solution totally makes sense knowing what you did, but seems completely crazy!

[06:17:20] <agcolom>  scott_gonzalez Hi :-)
[06:18:26] <scott_gonzalez> hi agcolom
[06:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> So what'd you have to change?
[06:18:42] <agcolom> right, so are you ready for the crazy explanation ?
[06:19:07] <agcolom> sorry no explanation but crazy thing that fixed it...
[06:19:17] <agcolom> so I went to check my php.ini
[06:19:27] <agcolom> I had 2 files with that name
[06:20:49] <agcolom> changed the memory_limit in one of them
[06:20:54] <agcolom> that didn't fix it.
[06:21:01] <agcolom> I chenged it in the other one
[06:21:04] <agcolom> didn't fix
[06:21:19] <agcolom> stopped and restarted MAMP servers
[06:21:24] <agcolom> that fixed it.
[06:21:44] <agcolom> Now I wanted to know which one of the two files should be changed.
[06:22:04] <agcolom> I changed one back to 32M, stopped and restarted the servers.
[06:22:10] <agcolom> that was still working...
[06:22:27] <agcolom> I changed the other one back also to 32M. and stopped and restarted the servers.
[06:22:33] <agcolom> it's still working! 
[06:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[06:22:47] <scott_gonzalez> That means we don't have a way to fix this.
[06:22:49] <agcolom> So like you I did those changes and undid them...
[06:23:01] <agcolom> no, it's crazy I don't understand
[06:25:23] <agcolom> so all we did is change the memory_limit to 256M in php.ini, stopped and restarted the servers, and change it back to 32M...
[06:26:28] <agcolom> so could it be that if the memory_limit becomes less than that specified in config.php that limit is ignored?
[06:27:21] <agcolom> or, if it gets smaller, that change isn't applied?
[06:29:05] <scott_gonzalez> No, because it would go back to not working at the end.
[06:30:27] <scott_gonzalez> Also, the purpose of ini_set() is to overwrite what's in php.ini.
[06:31:22] <agcolom> This is the only thing I did. I had little time and it was the 1st thing I did when I woke up. I didn't touch anything else... 
[06:31:37] <agcolom> I's really strange...
[06:31:56] <agcolom> So I've not uploaded anything in case that would still break the build
[06:32:53] <agcolom> I've got an idea...
[06:33:32] <agcolom> because I'm running grunt deploy but I've actually not changed anything... so I'll remove the 1.4alpha file and download it again... 
[06:34:58] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez:  yes, that broke
[06:36:39] <agcolom> ok, so I'm changing php.ini that is in MAMP/conf/php5.4.10
[06:36:43] <agcolom> to 256M
[06:37:05] <agcolom> stpopping Apache
[06:37:09] <agcolom> starting Apache
[06:37:20] <agcolom> and MySQL
[06:37:39] <agcolom> it's broken
[06:38:51] <agcolom> now the other php.ini which is in MAMP/bin/php/php5.4.10/conf
[06:39:17] <agcolom> stopping and restarting servers
[06:39:38] <agcolom> fixed.
[06:40:16] <agcolom> I'm going to change php.ini that is in MAMP/conf/php5.4.10 back to 32M and will add 1.3.1
[06:41:50] <agcolom> still fixed. 
[06:42:20] <agcolom> so the one that needed the change is in /Application/MAMP/bin/php/php5.4.10/conf
[06:42:56] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: your php.ini still has 32 for memory_limit?
[06:43:51] <agcolom> if it does, can you download http://jquerymobile.com/resources/download/jquery.mobile-1.3.1.zip and save it in resources/download
[06:43:58] <agcolom> and run grunt deploy. 
[06:44:16] <agcolom> it should give the warning/error message 
[06:47:47] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...it's failing. I restarted Apache to make sure.
[06:48:03] <scott_gonzalez> So, it must be what you said earlier of ini_set() not letting it set the value higher.
[06:48:32] <scott_gonzalez> And the reason just changing the php.ini doesn't work is because WordPress will set the memory limit to 32M if you don't specify an explicit value in your config.
[06:49:32] <agcolom> I think we were not getting the error after moving back to 32M because we had not changed anything in the directory/files
[06:50:07] <agcolom> so adding a new file in resources/download while the php.ini was at 32M caused the error
[06:50:33] <agcolom> because it's like if there is nothing new to be deployed, it's not doing a proper check
[06:51:42] <agcolom> so for me, what fixed it was to change the memory limit in /Application/MAMP/bin/php/php5.4.10/conf/php.ini 
[06:52:00] <scott_gonzalez> It's not a great solution for us.
[06:52:10] <scott_gonzalez> Set it back to 32M, restart Apache and verify that it's failing.
[06:52:19] <agcolom> no... 
[06:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> I want you to try something else.
[06:52:23] <agcolom> ok
[06:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have it failing?
[06:55:12] <agcolom> no, but I can have it in this state again by moving memory limit to 32 and dwnloading 1.3.0 zip
[06:55:17] <agcolom> shall I do that?
[06:57:14] <scott_gonzalez> You can just rename one of the large zips.
[06:57:40] <agcolom> it's failing 
[06:59:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, open /Applications/MAMP/conf/apache/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf
[06:59:35] <scott_gonzalez> Search for "ServerName dev.jquery.com"
[06:59:48] <scott_gonzalez> Add a line before "<Directory />"
[06:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> Put this on the new line: php_value memory_limit 256M
[07:00:21] <scott_gonzalez> Then restart apache and try again.
[07:00:57] <agcolom> I  don't have that server name
[07:01:17] <agcolom> I only have local.jquery.com
[07:02:08] <agcolom> https://gist.github.com/agcolom/5d3bc1c6424a61be8561
[07:03:46] <agcolom> OMG that worked!!!!
[07:04:01] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ^
[07:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right. I'm the oddball out now with dev.
[07:04:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, good. That's a solution we can live with.
[07:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> Because we document the virtual host setup.
[07:05:17] <agcolom> well I didn't think it would have been such a tricky one!
[07:05:59] <agcolom> but glad it's all fixed now :-) good team work ;-)
[07:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:06:30] <scott_gonzalez> MAMP must have a limitation that changes how memory_limit works.
[07:06:40] <agcolom> so I should wait to upload the large zips until you fix the memory_limit on the server?
[07:08:15] <agcolom> because that's fixed for us locally... but will it be fixed on the "real" server?
[07:08:33] <scott_gonzalez> The servers don't use apache.
[07:10:37] <agcolom> ok, so do you think it's safe to upload the large zips now?
[07:11:05] <agcolom> (I'd rather do that when you're around ;-) )
[07:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'd add them and see if the stage deploy fails.
[07:11:35] <agcolom> yes, so can I do that now?
[07:13:12] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ^
[07:13:15] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[07:13:22] <agcolom> ok...

[08:11:01] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: what is it exactly that I need to change in the xml ?
[08:11:19] <scott_gonzalez> options -> ui
[08:11:36] <agcolom> but only for popup?
[08:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/entries/popup.xml#L514-L518
[08:12:15] <scott_gonzalez> I'm assuming it's just this one event.
[08:12:44] <scott_gonzalez> The rule applies to all widget events.
[08:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> But based on the issue, I'm assuming this is the only one (or at least the only one that was noticed).
[08:14:19] <agcolom> ok, thanks. and now that I have sublime text showing me all the spaces at end of lines... it's horrible!!!! So many I need to fix!
[08:14:44] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[08:24:16] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, I'm ready to push the change. Should I close the issue?
[08:24:49] <agcolom> (to know or not to add Fixes #138 to the commit message)
[08:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> Your commit message should say "Fixes #xxx"
[08:25:08] <agcolom> great, thanks
[08:26:29] <gnarf> okay - so the stats on the cdn are insane
[08:27:06] <gnarf> especially since like most likely only 1/7th of the world is pulling from the new cdn
[08:38:41] <agcolom> is it possible that a git push goes into a black hole?
[08:39:25] <agcolom> I am totally confused!
[08:39:40] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I think I need your help! sorry!
[08:40:34] <agcolom> this is very strange. I have made the change to popup.xml.
[08:40:51] <agcolom> I have made a git commit and a git push
[08:41:16] <agcolom> I also added fixes #138 to the commit message.
[08:42:21] <agcolom> however, the changes don't show up on stage, I didn't get the email, and github is not showing the change, and the commit message didn;t show on irc either. 
[08:42:31] <agcolom> finally, the issue 138 is still open. 
[08:42:39] <agcolom> it's like the commit never happened!
[08:42:51] <agcolom> or didn't make it...
[08:48:34] <agcolom> github seems fine: https://status.github.com so what happened?
[08:49:44] <agcolom> so where did this go?
