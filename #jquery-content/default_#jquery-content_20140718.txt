[05:45:56] <kswedberg> what's up?
[05:55:33] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: I was working on https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/issues/207
[05:55:53] <scott_gonzalez> I couldn't figure out why https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/3db0fa5f69e84168fba4b0b3d80ff4afbbc24e41/entries/tabs.xml#L252-L263 didn't work because I knew that we did that in a lot of places.
[05:56:12] <scott_gonzalez> I wanted someone to confirm that I wasn't crazy and point out where we were doing it so I could figure out why it wasn't working.
[05:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> But I did eventually figure it out.
[05:58:03] <kswedberg> weird.was it that the xslt was looking up a descendant of a particular node or something?
[05:58:19] <kswedberg> glad you got it figured out. :)
[05:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> There's code to make it work specificially for options: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/master/tasks/jquery-xml/entries2html-base.xsl#L426-L437
[05:59:49] <scott_gonzalez> So you've probably never even used this form.
[06:00:26] <kswedberg> or if I have, I don't remember (which is just as likely)
[06:00:44] <scott_gonzalez> It's limited to documenting widgets.
[06:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Did you see https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/472 ?

[12:37:01] <kswedberg> @scott_gonzalez: I saw it, but I kind of got lost 
[12:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, don't worry about it.
[12:37:55] <kswedberg> @scott_gonzalez: I was also wondering... in your example, shouldn't extraParameter have an "s" at the end of it, since it can take more than one?
[12:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> well, it gets strange because the argument only contains one, but there may be many arguments.
[12:39:07] <scott_gonzalez> handler( event, extra, extra, extra, extra )
[12:39:11] <scott_gonzalez> vs.
[12:39:15] <scott_gonzalez> handler( event, extras )
[12:39:43] <scott_gonzalez> So there are basically two ways to document that.
[12:39:47] <kswedberg> right. yeah, it's kind of odd. 
[12:39:55] <scott_gonzalez> handler( event [, extras ] [, ... ] )
[12:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> handler( event [, extras... ] )
[12:40:31] <scott_gonzalez> But definitely not: handler( event [, ...extras ] )
[12:40:41] <scott_gonzalez> Because that would mean that extras is an arrya.
[12:40:44] <scott_gonzalez> *array
[12:41:15] <kswedberg> I see. 
[12:41:57] <scott_gonzalez> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope/rest_parameters
[12:42:09] <scott_gonzalez> Hooray ES6 :-)
[12:42:34] <kswedberg> haha, yeah, that rest parameter thing is crazypants
[12:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> so nice
[12:42:54] <kswedberg> for sure
[12:43:04] <scott_gonzalez> rest + spread will make a lot of code much cleaner.
[12:43:22] <kswedberg> We're sort of dealing with this at deferred.done
[12:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[14:37:59] <Mottie> I'm not sure if this has been reported, but it seems that the plugin registry is starting to label the recent updates with the same tag twice. All three of the recent updates have "-2" endings because of it... I did push an update to the master branch and to my gh-pages today, so I'm not sure if that is the cause, but it's only started happening recently.
[14:48:27] <scott_gonzalez> Mottie: It's known.
[14:48:39] <Mottie> ok thanks
