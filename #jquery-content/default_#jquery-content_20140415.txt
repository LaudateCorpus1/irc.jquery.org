[05:10:07] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Can we switch the YAML front matter on learn to JSON?
[05:10:12] <scott_gonzalez> It's the only site using YAML, and linking off to Jekyll to explain it is really odd.
[05:12:48] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Sounds good. I just created https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/75

[06:14:43] <kswedberg> excellent. thx, @scott_gonzalez

[07:38:59] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez seems like a bunch of make-work to me - also we use front matter on contribute
[07:39:10] <ajpiano> and i think we'd want to use front matter in yaml in any site that's primarily md
[07:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> We use front matter on every site.
[07:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> 90% of them are JSON
[07:40:03] <ajpiano> we use YAML on contribute is what i'm saying
[07:40:25] <ajpiano> too
[07:41:43] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we should be consistent.
[07:45:41] <ajpiano> i really don't think that there's a high cognitivie load of here
[07:46:28] <scott_gonzalez> It's not a high cognitive load, it's just annoying that there are seemingly random inconsistencies.
[07:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> We're also linking off to Jekyll documentation, which is confusing.
[07:50:08] <ajpiano> the idea that it's "seemingly random" instead of consistent with most other SSG environments where you use yaml front matter
[07:50:45] <ajpiano> is confusing to me
[07:51:18] <ajpiano> if there was one contributor ever who had said "Wow, it's confusing that i had to write JSON in one repo and YAML in another" 
[07:51:41] <ajpiano> but i don't believe that's happened
[07:55:12] <scott_gonzalez> Can we at least stop linking to http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/ ?
[07:55:24] <scott_gonzalez> It's really confusing.
[07:55:44] <ajpiano> sure
[07:56:32] <ajpiano> i just can't find another reference to the concept of "front matter" that isn't in the context of a particular ssg/blog framework thing
[07:57:20] <scott_gonzalez> I highly doubt anyone writing a new article for learn wouldn't understand without docs.
[07:57:35] <ajpiano> right

[11:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ping
[11:27:48] <nacin> hi
[11:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> Got a few minutes to help with a WordPress update?
[11:28:37] <nacin> running a meeting over in #wordpress-dev, but it should be as simple as just replacing the wordpress directory with the one from wordpress.org/latest.zip
[11:28:40] <nacin> even the one running 3.4
[11:31:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, but the images aren't showing up.
[11:32:12] <scott_gonzalez> For example: http://blog.jqueryui.com/2013/04/1000000-custom-downloads-in-four-months/
[11:33:47] <nacin> http://blog.jqueryui.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Downloads-per-version1.png
[11:33:59] <nacin> we don't proxy those through WP, so I'd check the filesystem and any rules
[11:34:03] <nacin> is this a new thing?
[11:36:13] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...well I'm not sure how this is working now, but I seem to have fixed it.
[11:37:34] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this is 2013, not 2014.
[11:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> The copy of the uploads directory apparently got messed up.
[11:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> It should all be working now.

[13:50:21] <brianarn> Hi all
[13:50:36] <brianarn> Given the comments in the speaker filing extension, I thought I'd peek in and mention something about my proposal.
[13:54:05] <brianarn> I had proposed a talk about Charles Proxy and the things you can do with it to dig a little deeper in debugging efforts, showing people how to inspect network traffic, rewrite it, simulate outages or slow networks, etc. I'm happy to bump that up into a longer talk or even make it a workshop style session if that's something you all would want to see.
[14:03:29] <ajpiano> brianarn that's good to know
[14:03:36] <ajpiano> thanks for letting me know
[14:09:24] <brianarn> Whatever I can do to help, just let me know :)
[14:10:48] <ajpiano> i think we'll schedule those largely based on the response
