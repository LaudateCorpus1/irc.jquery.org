[09:34:18] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: you around?
[09:34:32] <kswedberg> hi scott_gonzalez. yes, I am.
[09:34:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm working on adding support for <entry type="event"> for API sites.
[09:35:33] <kswedberg> ok. for jquerymobile in particular?
[09:35:37] <scott_gonzalez> We should name the pages xxx-event, just like we do with selectors, right?
[09:36:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, using mobile right now since they actually have events.
[09:36:30] <kswedberg> that makes sense, esp. if there is the possibility of name doubling. 
[09:36:41] <scott_gonzalez> Right, like the shorthands that core has.
[09:36:52] <scott_gonzalez> .change() vs the event itself.
[09:37:34] <kswedberg> hmm. would we ever have an entry for change-event in core?
[09:38:04] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I'm not sure if we should document the special events.
[09:38:29] <scott_gonzalez> I think at a minimum we should document when we diverge from real events.
[09:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> Like mouseenter and mouseleave are custom.
[09:38:54] <scott_gonzalez> If they just followed the spec, delegation wouldn't work.
[09:39:30] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: ^
[09:39:31] <kswedberg> I see. 
[09:40:02] <scott_gonzalez> Thougths on whether we should document any events on api.jquery.com? And if we should, which ones.
[09:40:08] <kswedberg> btw, we have a /load-event/ entry already to distinguish it from ajax /load/
[09:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[09:40:34] <kswedberg> so that puts a wrinkle into this.
[09:40:55] <DaveMethvin> in my ideal world? The entry for .click() would just say it's an alias for .on("click", ...) or .trigger("click")
[09:41:06] <scott_gonzalez> Clearly the solution is to just remove all the event shorthands :-)
[09:41:07] <DaveMethvin> and we'd discuss event semantics elsewhere
[09:41:24] <DaveMethvin> like a click-event entry
[09:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> Right, so that's what I'm thinking.
[09:41:53] <kswedberg> I was starting to think that special event stuff would go well in a learn.jquery.com article
[09:42:04] <scott_gonzalez> We'd have /click/ for the method signatures and /click-event/ for the event object and info about the event.
[09:42:30] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg i agree although people need to understand they're mainly for US and not THEM
[09:42:39] <DaveMethvin> so they need to stay out of our way
[09:42:47] <scott_gonzalez> But then the question is which events do we document? Everything we patch over?
[09:42:52] <DaveMethvin> for example if they create a "click" special event they are probably gonna screw things up
[09:43:06] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez the most common ones, and the ones with unusual semantics or quirks
[09:43:15] <DaveMethvin> click, change, focus/blur, etc
[09:43:29] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: true. why do we need to document them?
[09:43:29] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:43:40] <DaveMethvin> people somehow expect that "change" will fire when they programmaticallly change an input for example
[09:43:48] <DaveMethvin> and it doesn't 
[09:43:59] <DaveMethvin> the entry for change-evnet would be a perfect place to explain that
[09:45:17] <kswedberg> I see. 
[09:47:04] <kswedberg> would it make sense to have it be /click-event-type/ rather than just /click-event/ ?
[09:52:09] <scott_gonzalez> maybe
[09:52:48] <DaveMethvin> either works for me
[10:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg DaveMethvin agcolom: http://cl.ly/image/1O2S0y2J2Q43
[10:00:47] <scott_gonzalez> Ignore the fact that it uses "#elem" instead of window in the sample.
[10:01:50] <DaveMethvin> something like that, yeah ... i like the idea of showing typical usage
[10:02:13] <DaveMethvin> with `window` or `document` or maybe `selection` for more general cases
[10:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yeah, this page will show `window`
[10:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> I actually already have that implemented.
[10:02:46] <scott_gonzalez> It just wanted on the page when I did the screenshot.
[10:02:50] <DaveMethvin> not sure what the args would be there, perhaps there would be discussion of important stuff in the `event` object
[10:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> <entry name="orientationchange" type="event" example-selector="window">
[10:03:04] <DaveMethvin> ah, nice
[10:03:08] <scott_gonzalez> If there's no @example-selector, it uses "#elem"
[10:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, I should change the default to ".selector" to match other auto-generated examples.
[10:04:21] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: looks awesome. 
[10:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> So this entry looks like:
[10:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> <signature>
[10:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> 		<property name="orientation" type="String">
[10:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> 			<desc>The new orientation of the device. Possible values are <code>"portrait"</code> and <code>"landscape"</code>.</desc>
[10:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> 		</property>
[10:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> 	</signature>
[10:05:08] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a sane way to structure it.
[10:12:28] <DaveMethvin> so the property is the property name on the `event` object ... that may need some splainin
[10:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> Just add some wording above the list of properties?
[10:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's following the same pattern as properties with nested properties: http://api.qunitjs.com/QUnit.config/
[10:15:38] <scott_gonzalez> But we can easily add some text between the header and the list of properties.
[10:17:33] <DaveMethvin> a sentence above the properties would clarify it fine
[10:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> Suggestion for the wording?
[10:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just worried about the list of properties not being exhaustive and the wording being misleading.
[10:19:57] <scott_gonzalez> So I don't want to write something simple like "The following properties are available on the event object:"
[10:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Was it a concious decision to keep QUnit API headers green? http://api.qunitjs.com/QUnit.config/
[10:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I'll just use the simple wording for now. It's just software, so we can update it whenever we want :-)
[10:39:21] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: nope
[10:39:25] <ajpiano> oversight
[10:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> I figured.
[10:42:09] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: how about "Additional properties on the [event object](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/)" 
[10:42:45] <scott_gonzalez> What is going on with the code blocks on that page?
[10:43:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look into that after I finish this.
[10:43:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[10:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'll use that text.
[10:44:06] <DaveMethvin> the code blocks are wrapped in pre
[10:44:13] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I think I know what's going on.
[10:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> We don't process category descriptions.

[12:31:40] <shaunm> hi all
[12:32:07] <shaunm> I run an open source documentation conference. is there anybody I could talk to about getting some jquery docs people to join?
[12:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> shaunm: ajpiano and kswedberg would be good to talk to.
[12:34:08] <scott_gonzalez> Is there any info about the conference?
[12:34:35] <ajpiano> hi shaunm
[12:34:50] <shaunm> hi ajpiano
[12:35:02] <ajpiano> what's the conf
[12:35:09] <shaunm> info is at http://openhelpconference.com/
[12:35:15] <kswedberg> hi shaunm 
[12:35:42] <ajpiano> yikes, that is the day after jqcon in portland
[12:35:50] <shaunm> argh!
[12:35:59] <shaunm> it is impossible to pick a good date :/
[12:36:05] <kswedberg> yeah, I just noticed the same thing
[12:36:05] <ajpiano> ain't that the truth
[12:36:24] <shaunm> I've moved the date every year, and I always manage to conflict with something
[12:37:02] <ajpiano> shaunm: do you want someone to come speak about what we've done w/ opening our docs, or just to participate or....?
[12:38:03] <shaunm> I like meeting other people who work on docs in open source. it's why I run the conference
[12:38:40] <shaunm> so just coming out and joining is awesome. the conference is very discussion-focused, with maybe half the time spent on presentations
[12:38:55] <shaunm> but presentations are also good
[12:40:42] <shaunm> I also host a few teams for sprints after the conference, if you're interested. though I suppose if you have your whole team at something like jqcon anyway, it makes more sense to do sprints there
[12:49:31] <ajpiano> hmm, so that week is pretty tough for me in particular insofar as i have a conf the week before and vacation the week after
[12:50:12] <ajpiano> but it also sounds kind of awesome
[12:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> I also wouldn't be able to make it. I'm going on vacation immediately after the conf.
[12:54:21] <shaunm> I clearly need to move the conference to a vacation destination
[12:55:56] <ajpiano> works for jsconf :D
[12:57:48] <shaunm> wow, yeah, that looks awesome
[13:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[15:13:28] <vladikoff> is https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.min.js (SSLd version) supposed to work or not supported?
[15:22:55] <ajpiano> i don't think we have ssl support on code.jquery.com
[15:23:08] <ajpiano> i think we have been talking about it but it isn't set up yet
[15:25:25] <rworth> correct
[15:26:25] <vladikoff> ajpiano, might be a good idea to put a note on '/download page' , but up to you really 
[15:27:37] <ajpiano> there's nothing on the page right now that would make you think that https would work
[15:28:45] <vladikoff> ajpiano, well it's called 'jQuery CDN', I sort of assumed that all CDNs are SSLd now
[15:28:52] <ajpiano> ah
[15:29:08] <vladikoff> eh who knows
[15:29:35] <ajpiano> want to senda  PR :D
