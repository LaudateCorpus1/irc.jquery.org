[07:48:12] <kborchers> gotta love commit message typos ... oh well :)
[07:53:18] <arschmitz> kborchers: so you got that worked out for him awesome
[07:53:33] <kborchers> yeah :)
[07:56:54] <scottgonzalez> kborchers: An idle ZNC user is always a great rubber duck :-P
[07:57:08] <kborchers> :)
[07:57:27] <scottgonzalez> I called Apple (again) yesterday and they said another 24-48 hours to get the part to fix my laptop :-/
[07:57:35] <arschmitz> damn
[07:57:51] <arschmitz> did you have apple care?
[07:57:54] <scottgonzalez> yeah
[07:58:02] <arschmitz> well thats good at least
[07:58:08] <arschmitz> i didnt get apple care on mine
[07:58:15] <arschmitz> probably should have
[07:58:41] <scottgonzalez> This is the first time I've needed to get a MacBook repaired.
[07:58:49] <scottgonzalez> Been using them since 2008.
[07:58:56] <kborchers> i also do not have apple care ... http://i.lvme.me/djkl341.jpg
[07:58:58] <arschmitz> well thats good
[07:59:16] <scottgonzalez> I've had three different MacBooks since then.
[07:59:19] <kborchers> my favorite part of that image is the misspelling :D
[07:59:23] <arschmitz> mine has "No serviceable parts" so it would be a new one lol
[07:59:31] <scottgonzalez> So I guess I haven't had one for too long.
[08:00:04] <scottgonzalez> I would've preferred if they just handed me a new one. I could get it set up much faster than they can order this part...
[08:00:44] <arschmitz> true
[08:01:02] <scottgonzalez> I also expected them to hand me back my laptop with an empty HDD.
[08:01:18] <scottgonzalez> So in terms of my time it would've been the same.
[08:01:29] <scottgonzalez> But the fact that they had to order a part means that I might get it back with all my data.
[08:01:36] <scottgonzalez> Because I know they had the HDD in stock.
[08:01:51] <arschmitz> that would be a bonus
[08:04:19] <arschmitz> its kinda funny that on the retinas the batteries and sold state HDD are soldered down so they cant be replaced

[08:23:05] <scottgonzalez> Did they switch to flash drives at some point?
[08:23:17] <scottgonzalez> When I was waiting at the genius bar they had a video of it.
[08:24:24] <arschmitz> http://store.apple.com/us/buy-mac/macbook-pro?afid=p219%7CGOUS&cid=AOS-US-KWG-PLA
[08:24:37] <arschmitz> all say flash based storage now
[08:25:09] <arschmitz> for retina anyway
[08:25:57] <scottgonzalez> Ah, they're the same thing.
[08:26:02] <scottgonzalez> SSD is just flash in an enclosure.
[08:26:09] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:26:45] <arschmitz> i think they just wanted it to sound new and fancy
[08:28:09] <scottgonzalez> $2,700 for a maxed out 13" MBP
[08:28:43] <arschmitz> yeah i have the base model one its all i could afford
[08:29:55] <scottgonzalez> I'm pretty sure I got the base model non-retina right when the retinas came out, and just upgraded the RAM to 8GB.
[08:31:54] <scottgonzalez> Hmm...maybe it wasn't the base model. The receipt says MBP 13.3/2.9/2x4GB/750/SD
[08:32:08] <scottgonzalez> I don't think 2.9GHz would've been the base model.
[08:33:06] <arschmitz> no pretty sure thats the fastest in the pro
[08:33:33] <arschmitz> the 13" pro still listed has a 2.5GZ
[08:33:46] <arschmitz> upgradeable to 2.9
[08:34:26] <scottgonzalez> Oh yeah, it's an i7 2.9, so definitely not base.
[08:34:36] <scottgonzalez> You can't even get that in the 13" retinas now.
[08:34:43] <scottgonzalez> Highest is i7 2.8
[08:35:29] <scottgonzalez> Though I'm not sure if the turbo boost is new.
[08:35:40] * scottgonzalez knows nothing about hardware
[08:36:08] <arschmitz> no but the 2.8 has a higher turbo boost because its a newer generation i7
