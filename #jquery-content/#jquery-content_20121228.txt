[00:56:24] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: just checked api.qunitjs.com - the styles for method signatures are bad: http://bassistance.de/i/0c7eca.png
[00:57:06] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: for the navigation sidebar, it would be nice to have the padding on the anchors instead of the list items, bigger click areas
[02:28:46] <jquicommit> [13api.jqueryui.com] 15jzaefferer opened issue #85: Widget: Document window and document properties  02http://git.io/av77kA
[07:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: You're using an outdated commit.
[07:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/146
[07:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, I'll be going through the issues for web-base-template since they've just been piling up.
[07:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Were those the only two issues you found? If so, that's awesome :-)
[07:28:00] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I don't see what outdated commit you're referring to
[07:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> The lack of a background color on that method signature.
[07:28:17] <jzaefferer> I'm on web-base-template's new-css branch, its up-to-date
[07:28:42] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/9e94e5ccf541286bf4470a7e2c8aa7d29ef05fca
[07:30:03] <jzaefferer> mhm
[07:30:13] <jzaefferer> I guess it was just a cache issue :/
[07:30:47] <scott_gonzalez> Did everything else look good?
[07:31:10] <jzaefferer> the list styles on the intro and cookbook page are different on the api page
[07:31:25] <jzaefferer> red and underlined in one case, just gray in the other
[07:32:46] <scott_gonzalez> Hmmm...yeah, that's because they're not real sidebars :-P
[07:33:06] <scott_gonzalez> rworth and I discussed this and decided that they shouldn't be styled the same.
[07:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's a TOC, not a site navigation.
[07:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> It is a bit strange though.
[07:33:54] <scott_gonzalez> Since the API site is designed to look like a page within the main site.

[10:29:38] <ajpiano> ugh
[10:29:43] <ajpiano> why are we using images of gradients anyway
[10:29:57] <ajpiano> trying to make this color change for jquery mobile and qunit
[10:32:17] <ajpiano> if i just had the original background psd it would be so much easier than what i'm trying :/
[10:34:36] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/60
[10:35:12] <ajpiano> oh boom
[10:35:44] <ajpiano> so no qualms if i just get rid of the image, then
[10:36:05] <scott_gonzalez> None from me.
[10:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if you saw how much progress I was able to make this week.
[10:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> I've got jqueryui.com, api.jqueryui.com, qunitjs.com, api.qunitjs.com all done (with the exception of ThemeRoller/download builder).
[10:37:23] <ajpiano> yeah, i've been seeing a lot of stuff land
[10:37:27] <ajpiano> sweet
[10:37:39] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.com is still working (had to make a few tweaks to keep the old style).
[10:37:41] <ajpiano> yeah i want to get in there and just do the colours and maybe the fonts
[10:37:48] <scott_gonzalez> api.jquery.com and api.jquerymobile.com are close.
[10:38:04] <ajpiano> esp for mobile and qunit
[10:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> I closed out over a dozen issues today :-)
[10:38:42] <ajpiano> haha yea i got a lot of e-mails :D
[10:39:13] <ajpiano> ah ok
[10:39:27] <ajpiano> so i should be making background chnages still in base.css then
[10:39:52] <ajpiano> jquerymobile.com has some duplicative bacgkround image referencs, but that looks like it's cleaned up in api.jquerymobile.com
[10:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I haven't touched jquerymobile.com yet
[10:40:26] <ajpiano> cool
[10:40:35] <scott_gonzalez> I only did a bit of work on api.jquerymobile.com because I want all API sites to be working properly.
[10:40:40] <ajpiano> gotcha
[10:40:54] <ajpiano> i'm trying to just do https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/111
[10:41:07] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I kept telling agcolom that I'd fix all the design issues with api.jquerymobile.com as soon as we moved to new-css :-P
[10:41:13] <ajpiano> haha
[10:41:23] <ajpiano> the gh conversation we are having with 47m is kind of nuts
[10:41:26] <ajpiano> well, you are having
[10:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I feel like this is 2/3 of the conversations I have with them.
[10:41:50] <scott_gonzalez> It hurts my brain.
[10:41:54] <ajpiano> "what are we considering new-css?"
[10:42:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you know, that little thing that you promised would make everything better?
[10:42:38] <ajpiano> also typekit for local dev is kind of maddening
[10:42:54] <ajpiano> i want us to make the changes to dump proxima nova, use more klavika etc
[10:43:24] <ajpiano> but it seems to all need to be done in typekit, right?
[10:43:32] <scott_gonzalez> I think so.
[10:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't look at how TypeKit works at all.
[10:44:32] <ajpiano> i've played with it a little bit, but i don't have the keys to our typekit install
[10:44:34] <scott_gonzalez> Have you run into any slow page loads because of it?
[10:44:47] <ajpiano> only when i'm on the amtrak wifi :p
[10:44:50] <ajpiano> then i just comment it out in the template
[10:45:31] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:45:33] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/57
[10:45:36] <scott_gonzalez> 36s
[10:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[10:45:39] <ajpiano> man...some of these color changes would be a lot easier... with a css preprocessor :p
[10:46:22] <ajpiano> yeah, you'd think it would be ok generally
[10:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, a lot of stuff would be easier with a CSS preprocessor.
[10:47:02] <scott_gonzalez> But we need to get shit stable first.
[10:47:11] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:47:29] <ajpiano> but it kind of feels like i'm introducing instability if i go and add the same hex/rgb into a file 7 times
[10:47:43] <ajpiano> but it is what it is
[10:47:48] <ajpiano> different instability :p
[10:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> Meh, I'm sure it's already in there 30 times anyway :-P
[10:48:21] <scott_gonzalez> Our CSS is such a mess, even in new-css.
[10:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> I want to just go in and rip shit out.
[10:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> Like, will we ever use @hidden?
[10:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> Do we really need [hidden] { display: none; } in our stylesheet?
[10:49:13] <ajpiano> yeah base.css is ... large
[10:49:29] <ajpiano> speaking of making it larger though
[10:49:36] <ajpiano> i actually made some progress late last week on doing line numbers
[10:50:02] <ajpiano> i want to just add it into grunt-jquery-content than maintain our own fork of highlightjs
[10:50:45] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[10:50:48] <scott_gonzalez> Let's do it.
[10:50:52] <ajpiano> cool
[10:50:58] * scott_gonzalez sighs
[10:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/96#issuecomment-11738431
[10:51:13] <scott_gonzalez> I also like how he calls it web-based-template.
[10:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> Like we have non-web-based templates for our sites.
[10:51:26] <ajpiano> i was gonna start pushing that up after i got these colours done :p
[10:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> I guess web-base-template isn't really the best name anymore, since it's all of the themes, not just a base.
[10:52:05] <ajpiano> i felt bad adding a new registerHelper to grunt-jquery-content, but i don't want to simultatenously update it to 0.4 as part of this
[10:52:16] <ajpiano> yaeh, it's not the best name anymore
[10:52:19] <ajpiano> but that answer is infuriating
[10:53:12] <scott_gonzalez> I doesn't even address the heart of the issue, which is why did you write a style guide and not follow it when you rewrote all of our code?
[10:53:25] <ajpiano> they never rewrote the code
[10:53:33] <scott_gonzalez> The conversation in this issue is so far off track it's not even funny.
[10:53:39] <scott_gonzalez> wat?
[10:53:43] <scott_gonzalez> So where did new-css come from?
[10:53:58] <ajpiano> i should say, they never rewrote *all* of it
[10:54:18] <ajpiano> i think they were doing the style guide as like, here are some things we're gonna do when we continue rewriting your code
[10:54:30] <scott_gonzalez> I noticed that most of new-css had templates that didn't even work with the new CSS...
[10:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> oy
[10:54:43] <scott_gonzalez> Which they'll never get to.
[10:54:51] <ajpiano> right
[10:55:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm just gonna start ripping stuff out then.
[10:55:21] <ajpiano> ok
[10:55:23] <scott_gonzalez> I just wish we had at least one active designer working on this.
[10:55:32] <scott_gonzalez> There are a lot of decisions and changes I can't make on my own.
[10:55:52] <scott_gonzalez> Like this change you're trying to make for mobile.
[10:56:03] <scott_gonzalez> We should have someone responsible for that.
[10:56:11] <ajpiano> switching them all to css gradients>
[10:56:13] <ajpiano> ?
[10:56:28] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that and fixing the color.
[10:56:34] <scott_gonzalez> We don't even have color swatches for each site, do we?
[10:56:45] <ajpiano> i do, that's why i'm doing it
[10:57:05] <ajpiano> i have the nelson cash draft docs and like almost-final logos
[10:57:14] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:57:46] <ajpiano> hence why i want to get qunit purpleified and jquerymobile to the proper green
[10:57:52] <scott_gonzalez> So do you have swatches that show all of these colors? http://cl.ly/image/2Z3Z1o3X0G47
[10:58:24] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/3Z3l2s3N0p3Q
[10:58:25] <ajpiano> i have a doc that lists our major colors, they're just not in swatch format
[10:58:34] <ajpiano> but yes
[10:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> The header background is different than the page background.
[10:58:51] <ajpiano> the header is just magically transparent
[10:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> So when I got to Mobile, I had no idea what color to use, so I just picked a color :-/
[10:58:57] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1n282W1r2b3l
[10:59:03] <ajpiano> yeah no it's cool, i have a color for mobile
[10:59:25] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12_0uB_aKfcvxqJTRk9F7Wi9lkzb6oZMpFMRdTWGqUwg/edit
[11:01:29] <scott_gonzalez> So these are new colors?
[11:03:03] <ajpiano> yeah, basically
[11:03:06] <ajpiano> "refined" colours
[11:03:12] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/155599/34386/8574c7dc-5118-11e2-825e-2f07ee47820b.png
[11:06:27] <ajpiano> i don't even feel strongly about having gradients at all tbh
[11:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I already ripped out some "fancy" styling in the interest of getting stuff done.
[11:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> Less flashy released sites > flashy unreleased sites
[11:14:12] <ajpiano> like?
[11:14:13] <ajpiano> yeah
[11:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> Things like gradients and border highlights in the API docs.
[11:14:49] <ajpiano> i feel very strongly inclined to go with flat rather than gradient for now
[11:15:02] <ajpiano> especially because we have swatches of things looking very nice on flat colour
[11:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> current: http://cl.ly/image/3k3S0J1w2C0A
[11:15:17] <ajpiano> and no guidelines of how the gradients should be when using those flat colours
[11:15:19] <ajpiano> it's just "a bit lighter"
[11:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> new: http://cl.ly/image/2x1y2A2D3r1L
[11:15:51] <ajpiano> NO GRADIENTS IN THE HEADERS!?!?!
[11:15:54] <ajpiano> how can we live
[11:16:25] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[11:21:20] <ajpiano> rworth: do you have a source image for http://local.jquerymobile.com/web-base-template/themes/jquery/images/jq-nav-icons.png ?
[11:21:30] <ajpiano> i need it so i can change the mobile colour
[11:21:37] <ajpiano> and also we'll need it if we get rid of the All Projects menu
[11:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> yes please
[11:22:36] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: So far, the best part of today is that I got to eat a NY bagel with lox and cream cheese :-)
[11:22:44] <ajpiano> haha
[11:22:49] <ajpiano> i've been living off xmas leftovers all week
[11:22:59] <ajpiano> damn now that you mention it
[11:23:03] <ajpiano> that sounds so good
[11:23:08] <scott_gonzalez> mmm....lox
[11:23:11] * ajpiano seamlesses
[11:23:13] <rworth> hey
[11:23:17] <ajpiano> hi rworth
[11:23:33] <rworth> ajpiano I do not
[11:23:43] <ajpiano> who edited it for adding it into new-css ?
[11:23:48] <ajpiano> with the new jqm logo?
[11:23:56] <rworth> likely Jonathan?
[11:24:06] <ajpiano> how did he get that image, wasn't that original a doug?
[11:24:29] <rworth> maybe he recreated? Or edited. I don't know
[11:24:54] <rworth> the original was Doug, and I'd guess if an original original exists he has it, but I was never successful in getting from him more than we have
[11:25:14] <ajpiano> these sites feel like a gordian knot sometime
[11:25:20] <rworth> indeed
[11:25:36] <ajpiano> you think you're grabbing the low hanging fruit, then you get pulled halfway up the tree
[11:26:08] <ajpiano> rworth: what do you think of dropping gradient backkgrounds all together
[11:26:35] <rworth> +1
[11:26:48] * ajpiano kills with fire
[11:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> Can we also drop the All Projects menu?
[11:27:03] <ajpiano> yeah, i'm +1 for it
[11:28:07] <rworth> so, 5 icons?
[11:28:31] <ajpiano> we should probably put something for .org in there
[11:28:39] <rworth> that's what I was wondering
[11:29:02] <rworth> or is the idea that many of the top-right menu go there?
[11:30:02] <ajpiano> hmm yah, a lot of that does live on .org now
[11:36:54] <scott_gonzalez> WTF is <mark> ?
[11:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> Can we agree that we won't use <small>?
[11:39:04] <ajpiano> deal
[11:39:25] <ajpiano> rworth: do you think you can check to make sure our type kit is properly up to date
[11:39:35] <rworth> yeah
[11:39:36] <ajpiano> with klavika, and source code pro
[11:39:39] <ajpiano> and no more proxima nova
[11:40:19] <ajpiano> also i'm cutting new logosfrom the nelson cash source stuff
[11:40:24] <ajpiano> are we okay with dropping the slight drop shadow?
[11:40:29] <ajpiano> that's currently on all the logos
[11:40:30] <ajpiano> ?
[11:40:31] <scott_gonzalez> Can I drop rules for SVG too?
[11:40:51] <scott_gonzalez> DROP ALL THE THINGS.
[11:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> Can we just change our logos to the project name in Helvetica?
[11:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> No more icons.
[11:41:13] <ajpiano> done
[11:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> No drop shadows. No gradients.
[11:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> Just flat color + Helvetica. No tag lines either.
[11:42:52] <ajpiano> why didn't you have this idea 2 months ago!!!
[11:43:57] <ajpiano> damn there is all this custom handling for nav in base.css for each site too huh
[11:44:06] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[11:45:55] <ajpiano> oh but there's only custom colour overrides in the ui case, for the nav
[11:48:29] <ajpiano> well, there were :p

[12:59:38] <ajpiano> about mobile first
[13:00:01] <scott_gonzalez> And QUnit is really deep.
[13:00:13] <ajpiano> yeah, it's full on purple mc purple
[13:00:22] <ajpiano> it's like grimace and prince had a baby
[13:01:01] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:01:09] <scott_gonzalez> So, look at http://dev.api.jqueryui.com/effect/
[13:01:15] <scott_gonzalez> Or whatever your local URL is.
[13:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> Any idea what color we're supposed to use for that header background?
[13:01:56] <ajpiano> hold on i need to deploy that locally
[13:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> Man, there's just something about this menu nav.
[13:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> It looks 3d
[13:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> And out of place.
[13:03:15] <ajpiano> yeah,
[13:03:22] <ajpiano> i took out the special handling of the menu on nav on ui
[13:03:26] <ajpiano> so it's a weird colour now
[13:03:37] <ajpiano> yeah you're right,
[13:03:43] <ajpiano> i don't mind the beveling on the top and sides
[13:03:48] <ajpiano> but on the bottom it's super weird
[13:04:03] <ajpiano> i just wanted to take any special casing for ui out of base.css first
[13:06:11] <ajpiano> oh yeah, that header in ui
[13:07:40] <ajpiano> it should be #FAA523
[13:07:48] <ajpiano> or it could be the dark orange again
[13:08:00] <ajpiano> yeah that's a lot better
[13:08:05] <ajpiano> #b24926
[13:08:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the other one is a bit too bright.
[13:08:57] <ajpiano> i'm gonna use the brighter one for anchors in the very top
[13:09:06] <ajpiano> where it says Returns: Whatever
[13:10:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, right now api.jquery.com is the only one that has different link colors.
[13:10:15] <scott_gonzalez> But that's just because it was the only one that didn't have enough contrast before.
[13:10:21] <ajpiano> exactly
[13:10:26] <ajpiano> the orange doesn't have contrast either
[13:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> So you can just look at api.jquery.com/style.css to see which selectors to use.
[13:10:32] <ajpiano> api.qunitjs will prob need it
[13:11:11] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, there's an outdated selector in there.
[13:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> .versionAdded doesn't exist anymore.
[13:11:22] <ajpiano> heh, yeah i only took the top one
[13:11:29] <ajpiano> i was just gonna go with .section-title a
[13:11:52] <ajpiano> i'll just do the version-details a, .returns a
[13:12:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that works, if you only need the very top one to be different.
[13:12:32] <scott_gonzalez> .section-title = top only, .version-details + .returns = all headers.
[13:13:01] <ajpiano> ah, i will need it for all
[13:13:04] <ajpiano> so yeah, good call
[13:13:16] <ajpiano> do you know why we redeclare a:hover { color: #333 } in every child theme?
[13:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> Because at the time that I was removing stuff, I wasn't sure if that was different across sites.
[13:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> But I've gone through all the API sites and reduced their styles and that was the same in all.
[13:14:26] <scott_gonzalez> So we should just move that to base.css.
[13:14:28] <jqcommit> 01[13web-base-template01] 15ajpiano pushed 1 new commit to 06new-css: 02http://git.io/yGX_5g
[13:14:28] <jqcommit> 13web-base-template/06new-css 14d9dae68 15adam j. sontag: api.jqueryui.com: Update header background and link colors
[13:14:49] <scott_gonzalez> Also it's a bit annoying that we have to redeclare the color for anchors in the api themes.
[13:14:55] <ajpiano> yeah
[13:15:14] <ajpiano> if only there was a way to declare variables in css ;)
[13:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:15:42] <scott_gonzalez> At least the duplication is really minimal now.
[13:15:46] <ajpiano> yeah
[13:15:52] <scott_gonzalez> The API themes are super tiny :-)
[13:15:56] <ajpiano> things look better with the new logos
[13:16:03] <ajpiano> without having the color-on-color tagline
[13:16:05] <ajpiano> so i'm happy that's in
[13:16:19] <ajpiano> and um, sorry gradients!
[13:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:16:37] <ajpiano> if someone wants to add css versions that can be handled separately
[13:16:44] <scott_gonzalez> damn gradients https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/135
[13:17:02] <ajpiano> CONFESSION TIME
[13:17:08] <ajpiano> best way to start a pr ever
[13:17:37] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:20:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm done for the day. Have a good weekend.
[13:22:50] <ajpiano> hah ok
[13:22:59] <ajpiano> was about to ask you a hard one
[13:23:00] <ajpiano> :p
[13:24:29] <ajpiano> i actually was, but it can wait
