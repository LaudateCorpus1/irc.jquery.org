[05:00:59] <scott_gonzalez> Hey kswedberg
[05:01:57] <kswedberg> hey!
[05:03:25] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez what's up‚Üë
[05:04:15] <scott_gonzalez> We have a slight issue with API entries when there are more than one entry in a file.
[05:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> For example, https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries/zIndex.xml
[05:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> Each entry lists its own categories.
[05:06:04] <scott_gonzalez> When we generate the HTML file for syncing with WordPress, all of the categories get listed.
[05:06:05] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/master/tasks/jquery-xml/entries2html-base.xsl#L33-L41
[05:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> So in this case, we end up with [ "methods", "ui-core", "methods", "ui-core" ]
[05:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> This is what the result looks like: https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/08f7c96bc8ae9e7d6c09
[05:09:00] <kswedberg> huh. does this affect the publicly viewed page? doesn't seem to: http://api.jquery.com/val/
[05:09:18] <scott_gonzalez> We never noticed this before because WordPress handles this correctly and essentially ignores the duplicate categories.
[05:09:27] <kswedberg> gotcha. 
[05:10:03] <kswedberg> but now it's causing a problem somewhere else? is it possible to run a grunt task that de-dupes?
[05:10:04] <scott_gonzalez> rxaviers noticed this because he was parsing through the results.
[05:10:14] <kswedberg> ah
[05:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> I had three thoughts about how to handle this.
[05:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> One is what you suggsted, with a completely separate process to de-dupe.
[05:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> Another is to make the XSL smart enough not to write the dupes.
[05:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea how to do that, or if it's even possible.
[05:12:05] <scott_gonzalez> And the third is to change files with multiple entries to just list the categories in <entries> instead of <entry>, since we can't have entry-specific categories when there are multiple entries anyway.
[05:12:25] <kswedberg> welcome to the arcane world of XSLT. :) ‚Ä¶ of course, you should be welcoming me, because you know about it a lot more than I do.
[05:12:39] <scott_gonzalez> The third seemed like a simple solution, until I thought about the generated full XML.
[05:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> We'd need to move the categories from <entries> to <entry> when we build that file.
[05:13:25] <agcolom> Hey!
[05:13:31] <kswedberg> or just use the categories from the first <entry>
[05:13:33] <kswedberg> hi agcolom 
[05:13:53] <agcolom> Hi kswedberg, hi scott_gonzalez... 
[05:14:22] <scott_gonzalez> We can do that too.
[05:14:53] <scott_gonzalez> We actually have one place in UI where we have multiple entries with different categories, but we can change that.
[05:14:55] <kswedberg> seems a little hackish, but also the least difficult
[05:15:04] <agcolom> kswedberg: I hope you don't mind me trying to make the api.jquery.com examples match the formatting guidelines... 
[05:15:12] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery.widget.xml documents both jQuery.widget() (the utility for creating widgets) and jQuery.Widget (the base widget).
[05:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> They're both in the utilities category, but only the latter is in the widget category.
[05:15:33] <scott_gonzalez> Makes sense to just put them both in the widget category.
[05:15:34] <kswedberg> agcolom: I *never* mind when you help out with core api docs. :)
[05:15:48] <scott_gonzalez> Especially since when they reach WordPress, they end up in the same category anyway, since it's a single page.
[05:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> I think I said almost those exact words to agcolom when she asked me if you would mind :-P
[05:16:55] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so first entry it is.
[05:16:56] <agcolom> kswedberg: good! Thanks :-) I'm nearly ready to pick up my son from his induction day at secondary school... then home and off again to graduation ceremony and dinner... so won't do anything today, but will be back on that tomorrow :-)
[05:16:59] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[05:17:26] <kswedberg> thx, agcolom! and congrats on your son's graduation.
[05:17:41] <agcolom> that's not his, it my students' :-)
[05:18:12] <agcolom> and discovered the head of year 10 at the secondary school is one of my students who graduated in 2009!
[05:18:27] <agcolom> Good job I'm nice to my students!
[05:18:30] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: ok, cool. since it's such a small change, we can always change to one of your other three options if it messes up something that we hadn't considered.

[14:15:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh no, that massive image on the Austin site doesn't even have alt=""
[14:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> Why is that not just a background image on the header?
[14:17:02] <scott_gonzalez> And what's going on with the spacing?
[14:17:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1o2n1G1q3w3G
[14:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> And the footer links are whacky on what I presume to be a common resolution: http://cl.ly/image/2G3X132g1E00
[14:28:40] <ajpiano> hm yea spacing seems to be flush, i can fix that
[14:28:43] <ajpiano> yea that image is annoying as hell
[14:28:48] <ajpiano> i want it to be text over the image
