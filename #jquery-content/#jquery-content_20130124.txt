[06:29:38] <rworth> scott_gonzalez to your concern about the html example on the homepage, should we just add a parseInt?
[06:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like that would just make the example more convoluted and not really portray the security concern as well.
[06:31:48] <scott_gonzalez> Before it really stood out as the wrong thing to do.
[06:32:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's still the wrong thing to do, but it's less obvious that it's wrong now.
[06:33:00] <rworth> right
[06:33:02] <scott_gonzalez> I think a copy-pastable example would be better though.
[06:33:08] <scott_gonzalez> Like, hit a real API.
[06:33:30] <rworth> that would mean using jsonp, no?
[06:33:35] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[06:33:44] <rworth> which makes it more convoluted
[06:33:57] <scott_gonzalez> How?
[06:34:15] <rworth> don't you have to add another option?
[06:34:56] <scott_gonzalez> One more option if you use $.ajax() (dataType: "json")
[06:35:07] <scott_gonzalez> And it's actually less code if you use $.getJSON()
[06:39:20] <rworth> jquery-wp-content was tagged 2.0.15 five hours ago, but the latest tag is 2.1.1

[07:21:36] <scott_gonzalez> Do we want "older plugins", "newer plugins" or do we want page numbers?
[07:22:03] <rworth> I think page numbers would make more sense, esp. caus it won't always be by date, right?
[07:22:18] <rworth> can't we change the sort?

[07:25:24] <scott_gonzalez> Page numbers for all listing pages on all sites?
[07:25:27] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I'd prefer.
[07:25:34] <rworth> worksforme
[07:25:39] <scott_gonzalez> Gives us consistency, and also a sense of where you are within the results.
[07:25:40] <rworth> would be nice to have consistent navigation
[07:25:42] <rworth> yup
[07:28:47] <rworth> how is api.jquerymobile.com live if it has no tags?

[07:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> He just pushed the tag.

[07:50:00] <Mottie1> you're welcome :)
[08:00:38] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I feel like I've asked you this before, but what's the deal with needing the big number hack in this example? http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/paginate_links#Examples
[08:01:09] <nacin> I don't remember my answer
[08:01:19] <nacin> that function is too low level, likely, for what you want.
[08:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> We want page links.
[08:02:43] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/391L1L3g2g45
[08:07:45] <gnarf> We have ssl working on jquery.org now
[08:08:08] <rworth> awesome thanks gnarf and danheberden 
[08:09:01] <rworth> I'm getting an Error 102 (net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED): The server refused the connection.
[08:09:18] <rworth> also, once we get it (fully) working, can we force it with a redirect?
[08:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Should we be building out the nav ourselves?
[08:09:46] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: looking
[08:09:50] <nacin> where do you want page links?
[08:10:36] <scott_gonzalez> search, tag, category, etc.
[08:10:38] <scott_gonzalez> Everywhere that we're using twentyeleven_content_nav().
[08:11:15] <gnarf> rworth: the ssl is on jq01
[08:11:22] <gnarf> jquery.org isn't really pointed there yet
[08:11:28] <gnarf> but if if you fake it out in hosts file you can see it
[08:11:31] <rworth> ah, so HOSTS
[08:11:32] <rworth> ok
[08:11:38] <gnarf> rworth: you're saying you want all requests to jquery.org on https://
[08:11:39] <gnarf>  ?
[08:11:57] <rworth> gnarf I guess I'm not sure
[08:12:06] <rworth> certainly jquery.org/join needs to be
[08:12:14] <rworth> so we could just do that one page
[08:12:32] <rworth> but it would suck to then be on it for the other page but not consistently (I think)
[08:13:11] <rworth> that is, following relative links after being on /join/ would then have you on it for other pages
[08:13:14] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: it has never occurred to me we are missing a function here, but we are.
[08:13:16] <gnarf> rworth: i'll work on that
[08:13:21] <rworth> gnarf thanks
[08:14:13] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: So I guess that means for now we should just implement it ourselves?
[08:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> Or use the hack?
[08:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it wouldn't be too hard to build it using get_pagenum_link(), get_query_var(), and $wp_query->max_num_pages
[08:16:33] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: paginate_links() is simply a templating function. it takes a number of variables, including a template for what URL we need to paginate. get_pagenum_link() contains the logic for the URL template but takes a page number. by passing 999999 and then swapping out that value for the template key (%#%, for some ancient reason), you have a template to pass to paginate_links().
[08:16:42] <nacin> the whole thing is stupid, and most of this has been ripe for a full refactor.
[08:17:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I understand what's happening in there.
[08:20:52] <gnarf> rworth: stage.jquery.org now redirects you
[08:20:56] <gnarf> so it should work on live
[08:21:32] <rworth> perfect
[08:23:07] <gnarf> ps, i'm still not on the yoda page: https://stage.jquery.org/team/
[08:23:10] <gnarf> :)
[08:24:15] <rworth> gnarf I'm working on that this week :)
[08:24:24] <rworth> just updated the team page on jquery.org, need to copy it over

[08:51:03] <kswedberg> ajpiano: I have a lunch mtg that'll most likely spill into the jQuery content meeting. 
[08:52:08] <kswedberg> ajpiano: the only thing I wanted to mention was getting "Deprecated" sub-categories to work for api.jquery.com. I think scott_gonzalez was going to look into that.
[08:54:55] <gnarf> ajpiano: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/139#issuecomment-12658671
[08:55:33] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Where did we leave off with that? Were we going to move it out of a category and into its own taxonomy?
[08:56:02] <kswedberg> oh, yeah, I think so. "removed" also. 
[08:56:27] <kswedberg> and maybe have it do that automagically
[08:57:13] <scott_gonzalez> Are you going to continue to mark APIs as removed, as opposed to actually removing them and having versioned docs?
[08:58:38] <kswedberg> I dunno. I don't know the full ramifications of that. I guess now that we have semver tags, we could do versioned docs. But I can't set that up.
[08:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's pretty easy. If we want to do that, I can get it setup.
[08:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> Basically, we create a 1-8 branch from master.
[08:59:41] <kswedberg> will it be easy for people to go back to, say, the 1.8 docs?
[08:59:50] <kswedberg> on the live stie?
[08:59:54] <scott_gonzalez> And then we setup api.jqueryui.com/1.8/ to have that.
[09:00:12] <kswedberg> ah. ok.
[09:00:14] <scott_gonzalez> Check out the link in the bottom section of http://api.jqueryui.com
[09:00:40] <scott_gonzalez> We have full sites hosted as subdirectories.
[09:01:26] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be trickier for core with the dual versions.
[09:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> Having 1.9 and 2.0 being the same API.
[09:01:45] <kswedberg> oh yeah. hmmm. 
[09:02:30] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I was also going to say that you should have those links show on the search results page (especially if nothing is found)
[09:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> good idea

[09:20:32] <Mottie1> I kind of have an issue with the navigation... on jquery.com, the second nav has download, api doc, blog, plugins, browser support. But if I click on plugins, it changes (expectedly), but the only way to get back to the jquery.com pages is the click the icon in the top nav. Maybe it needs a "main" button or "back" or something?
[09:22:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you get into a weird situation when on any subdomain.
[09:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> Since subdomains have the same layout, colors, menu, etc. it's not obvious that the logo will link to a different place.
[09:22:59] <scott_gonzalez> For example, from any page on jquery.com, clicking the logo takes you to jquery.com.
[09:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> But if you click on Blog or API Documentation, it *looks* like you're still on the same site, but now the logo links somewhere else.
[09:24:04] <Mottie1> the logo on http://api.jquery.com/ links back to itself

[09:37:40] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: When is learn going to be published?
[09:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.com is linking to it.
[09:39:40] <johnkpaul> I think that something is wrong with the DNS for qunitjs.com
[09:39:42] <johnkpaul> https://gist.github.com/4625005
[09:40:48] <gnarf> johnkpaul: its qunitjs.com not www. ;)
[09:41:00] <johnkpaul> I know, but is there no redirect on purpose?
[09:41:06] <johnkpaul> ah, I see ;)
[09:41:08] <gnarf> i don't think there is on that one
[09:41:18] <johnkpaul> oh ok
[09:41:32] <johnkpaul> I just got my verizon fios dns advertising page when I accidently typed www.
[09:41:34] <gnarf> i mean, i suppose i could add one, but www is so 20th centuray
[09:41:47] <gnarf> minus the typing/spelling error
[09:42:15] <johnkpaul> yeah, my hands have the memory of an aged internet user
[10:23:36] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: where is jquery.com linking to it
[10:23:40] <ajpiano> i think it's gonna end up being monday
[10:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> Right under the download button.
[10:25:04] <scott_gonzalez> How jQuery works
[10:25:24] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I think I've forgotten how PHP work :-P
[10:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> $wp_query->max_num_pages === 1 // false
[10:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> $wp_query->max_num_pages == 1 // true
[10:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> var_dump( $wp_query->max_num_pages ) // float(1)
[10:25:57] <nacin> float(1)?
[10:26:03] <nacin> that's cool.
[10:26:07] <nacin> not sure how you did that one.
[10:26:13] <nacin> or us, for that matter. :-)
[10:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:26:23] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i'm tempted to just tag learn and blog next week
[10:26:27] <ajpiano> that article is fine
[10:26:36] <ajpiano> as are a lot of the articles in there
[10:26:46] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Ok, I've got a bunch of links to re-enable once learn is live for realz.
[10:26:53] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: it gets set via the ceil() function, which for some reason returns a float.
[10:28:28] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: it returns a float because floats can be bigger and outside the bounds of integers. we can cast that in core.
[10:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a reasonable thing to cast to int.
[10:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> I was going a bit crazy before I did the var_dump() :-)
[10:31:03] <nacin> for now, cast it or do ==
[10:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I'm just doing ==
[10:34:31] <RWhitbeck> no content meeting today?

[11:01:43] <hikalkan> Hi all. Is jQuery Plug-in site working now?
[11:04:00] <scott_gonzalez> hikalkan: Was it ever not working?
[11:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, besides that year where ajpiano totally broke it...

[11:08:18] <hikalkan> How many minutes it take to add a plug-in? I added my plug-in 15 minutes ago (read and done everything in http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/), but it's not added yet.

[11:13:18] <hikalkan> Thanks a lot.
[11:14:08] <hikalkan> In fact, I dont want to increase version number :( I changed manifest file. Is there any chance to forse it to re-try?
[11:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> hikalkan: You get one retry by tagging with a v prefix.
[11:15:54] <ajpiano> no
[11:15:57] <ajpiano> oh
[11:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> e.g., v2.0.1
[11:16:02] <Mottie1> scott_gonzalez: is that log updating at all? It doesn't seem like it
[11:16:43] <scott_gonzalez> Mottie1: Is there an entry you expect to be there that isn't?
[11:16:48] <hikalkan> is v2.0.1 will be tag name or manifest version?
[11:16:59] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i'm planning to add stuff addressing the whole "i don't want to tag another version just because my manifest changed"
[11:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> tag name. The version in the manifest must not contain any prefix.
[11:17:48] <hikalkan> Thanks a lot. I'm trying right now.
[11:17:55] <Mottie1> nope. I just don't see hilkalka name in there
[11:18:09] <scott_gonzalez> It's the 3rd line up.

[11:19:56] <hikalkan> One more question. How my profil image is shown on the plug-in page? Is it related to my email address.
[11:19:56] <Mottie1> LOL ok sorry... I was going crazy with the LK typing, or something LOL
[11:20:40] <ajpiano> hikalkan: using gravatar

[14:28:57] <Luke23ae> Hi there, I have troubles registering my plugin. I asked here and posted in the forums, I can't seem to get an answer. Is there anything else I can do?
[14:39:02] <Mottie1> Luke23ae: Check the log here http://plugins.jquery.com/error.log
[14:41:58] <Luke23ae> Mottie1: Thanks man! There it is!
[14:54:21] <Luke23ae> hehe, I've seen you found my forum post :)
[14:54:53] <Mottie1> lol
[14:55:10] <Mottie1> I thought they posted something about the error log
[14:55:28] <Luke23ae> I haven't seen it so far
[14:56:03] <Luke23ae> how do you tell jquery.com that you want to update or submit your plugin again?
[14:56:44] <Luke23ae> btw: they actually tell you in the submitting tutorial that by now they have no mechanisim for tracking errors and that you shall ask in this channel
[15:00:33] <Mottie1> Luke23ae: you need to push a new tag to your repo... and make sure it matches the manifest
[15:00:42] <Luke23ae> I did that
[15:00:44] <Luke23ae> hm
[15:02:02] <Luke23ae> but I updated the manifest and commited the new tag in 2 seperate commits. do you know if that might be a problem?
[15:15:54] <Mottie1> honestly, I don't know. You might need to wait someone from jQuery to get back with you
[15:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> Luke23ae: What repo?
[15:27:41] <Luke23ae> https://github.com/LukasBombach/jQuery.wysiwyg
[15:27:46] <Luke23ae> scott_gonzalez: ^
[15:28:51] <scott_gonzalez> Luke23ae: You didn't delete a tag and re-tag, did you?
[15:29:10] <Luke23ae> no I didn't the publishing page said ai shouldn't
[15:29:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[15:29:24] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check the full logs.
[15:30:08] <Luke23ae> scott_gonzalez ty
[15:31:01] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I don't see anything at all about 0.1.1 in the logs.
[15:31:14] <Luke23ae> I I think I tried updating my tag around 15 o'clock gmt today
[15:31:28] <Luke23ae> the tag is there
[15:31:29] <Luke23ae> https://github.com/LukasBombach/jQuery.wysiwyg/tags
[15:31:37] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub has been having a lot of issues recently.
[15:31:40] <Luke23ae> hmm
[15:31:41] <scott_gonzalez> Try pressing the test hook button.
[15:31:52] <scott_gonzalez> I noticed some of our commits weren't getting announced earlier today as well.
[15:32:06] <dwieeb> Is there just a delay? 
[15:32:12] <dwieeb> My test hook button doesn't do anything. 
[15:32:33] <Luke23ae> Test hook doesn't respond in any way
[15:32:47] <Luke23ae> what *should* I see?
[15:32:53] <scott_gonzalez> You shouldn't see anything.
[15:33:01] <Luke23ae> ok
[15:33:06] <scott_gonzalez> Other than your plugin being listed on the site :-)
[15:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> http://plugins.jquery.com/wysiwyg/
[15:33:33] <Luke23ae> whaaat
[15:33:35] <Luke23ae> ok
[15:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> dwieeb: The test hook button is instant, but the only thing it does is send web hooks, so there's nothing for you to see on that page after you click it.
[15:33:54] <scott_gonzalez> Luke23ae: GitHub must not have sent the post-receive hook earlier.
[15:34:02] <scott_gonzalez> Like I said, they were skipping some earlier.
[15:34:06] <scott_gonzalez> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-content/%23jquery-content_20130124.log.html#t09:32:24
[15:34:06] <dwieeb> Okay, but I'm not seeing my plugin on the site after pushing the tag. 
[15:34:15] <scott_gonzalez> Proof that I'm not making this up :-P
[15:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> dwieeb: Which repo?
[15:34:29] <dwieeb> https://github.com/dwieeb/jquery-textrange
[15:34:38] <Luke23ae> scott_gonzalez: thanks very much man
[15:34:49] <scott_gonzalez> Luke23ae: There's built-in redundancy in the plugins site. So the next push you did (regardless of whether there was a new tag), would've caused us to find the 0.1.1 tag and post it.
[15:35:32] <Luke23ae> alrigh
[15:35:32] <Luke23ae> t
[15:35:55] <scott_gonzalez> dwieeb: You don't have any semver tags.
[15:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> 1.0 is not semver. 1.0.0 is.
[15:36:12] <dwieeb> Oh piss.
[15:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to update the version number in the manifest and then tag with that version.
[15:36:52] <scott_gonzalez> This is one of the few things you won't find in the error log.
[15:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> We don't write out any notification for tags that aren't semver, because there are a million reasons that might create such a tag.
[15:37:33] <dwieeb> Gotcha.
[15:38:42] <scott_gonzalez> dwieeb: You forgot to change the version number in the manifest.
[15:38:49] <dwieeb> I did not!
[15:39:02] <dwieeb> :P
[15:39:42] <scott_gonzalez> After you fix the version number, you'll need to `git tag v1.0.0` because the plugins site tracks which tags it has processed.
[15:39:56] <scott_gonzalez> So it won't process a 1.0.0 tag again, even if you delete it and re-tag.
[15:40:45] <dwieeb> Oh, alright. 
[15:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> success!
[15:42:18] <dwieeb> Wooooooooooo! 
[15:42:28] <dwieeb> Thank you so much for your help.
