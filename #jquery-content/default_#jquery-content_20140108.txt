[11:54:58] <detr0it> Looking for help.  I followed jquery-wp-content README instructions. local.jquery.com loads but div#content says "Nothing Found".  All other pages (e.g. local.contribute.jquery.org respond with Fatal error 'Failed opening required "(include_path='.:/usr/share/pear')" in /path/to/mu_plugins/_loader.php on line 6'.
[11:59:59] <scott_gonzalez> detr0it: Sounds like you have file permission issues.
[12:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> Is jquery-wp-content readable by your web server user?
[12:03:43] <detr0it> scott_gonzalez: I didn't change permissions on that sub directory.  Should I use the same commands for that I used to set the root jquery directory permissions?
[12:04:25] <scott_gonzalez> Step 7 tells you what to do.
[12:06:25] <scott_gonzalez> Step 3 looks like it has the wrong top level folder in the example.
[12:06:25] <detr0it> scott_gonzalez: I followed that step using the jquery-wp-content parent directory as the target.
[12:06:51] <scott_gonzalez> Which was your wordpress directory, correct?
[12:06:59] <detr0it> yes
[12:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> Are you sure you used the correct user?
[12:08:45] <detr0it> Not 100% certain.  I installed the LAMP stack on archlinux.  I believe the user is 'http'
[12:10:23] <detr0it> my file tree looks the same as the example in Step 3.  I subbed 'jquery' for 'wordpress' in Step 7.
[12:10:57] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:18:30] <scott_gonzalez> detr0it: It shouldn't actually be trying to require the file you're getting the fatal error for.
[12:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> There is no contribute.jquery.org directory in mu-plugins.
[12:24:28] <detr0it> OK.  Maybe I didn't set it up correctly.  Is there supposed to be a 'wordpress' directory under the DocumentRoot from Step 1?
[12:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> No, WordPress should *be* the document root.
[12:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> Step 2: Place the WordPress core files at the document root you chose. For example, if you used /srv/www/jquery, you should unzip or clone WordPress directly into that directory, not a directory below it.
[12:32:45] <detr0it> That's what I did. Here is the exact response I receive when I browse to local.contribute.jquery.org: 
[12:33:41] <detr0it> Warning: require_once(/srv/www/jquery): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /srv/www/jquery/jquery-wp-content/mu-plugins/_loader.php on line 6
[12:34:52] <detr0it> Fatal error: require_once(): Failed opening required " (include_path='.:/usr/share/pear') in /srv/www/jquery/jquery-wp-content/mu-plugins/_loader.php on line 6
[12:35:53] <scott_gonzalez> It shouldn't be trying to require that path.
[12:36:01] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure why it's trying to do that.
[12:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> detr0it: Put an echo before and inside the foreach in _loader.php.
[12:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> For local.contribute.jquery.org, you should only see the echo from before the loop.
[12:47:32] <detr0it> scott_gonzalez: Both echo's show up
[12:50:13] <scott_gonzalez> What's $domain_specific_file inside the loop?
[12:57:00] <detr0it> it's empty
[12:57:33] <scott_gonzalez> What version of PHP are you usin?
[12:58:04] <detr0it> 5.5.7
[13:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, this might be a change in how PHP works.
[13:01:25] <scott_gonzalez> Add this before the foreach: var_dump(glob( dirname( __FILE__ ) . "/$live_domain/*.php" ));
[13:03:04] <detr0it> bool(false)
[13:03:47] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, that's the problem.
[13:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> So glob() is returning false instead of an empty array for you.
[13:04:25] <scott_gonzalez> That actually sounds like a bug in PHP.
[13:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> Since glob() should always return an array.
[13:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, actually, you're getting an error.
[13:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> Kind of annoying that it uses false for errors instead of actually throwing an error.
[13:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm guessing it's back to file permissions.
[13:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> What does this print? var_dump( dirname( __FILE__ ) . "/$live_domain/*.php" );
[13:08:56] <detr0it> string(72) "/srv/.../mu-plugins/contribute.jquery.org/*.php"
[13:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[13:11:04] <scott_gonzalez> What if you chmod +777 mu-plugins ?
[13:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> Let's just completely rule out file permissions if we can.
[13:12:16] <detr0it> still broken

[13:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: /srv/.../ is just the redacted path.
[13:41:54] <gnarf> sure
[13:42:11] <gnarf> seems glob + open_basedir with absoulte path is a recipie for "false" results
[13:45:24] <gnarf> cc nacin: you know of any other obvious "why the hell does this return false" reasons?
[13:45:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: maybe we should just put a better guard wrapper around glob to ensure an empty array?
[13:48:02] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if we're getting false, we're getting an actual error.
[13:48:14] <scott_gonzalez> If that's the case, a better guard would just mask the error.
[13:48:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: could also log a more sane one :)
[13:49:35] <gnarf> might also be worth trying `chmod -R a+rX jquery-wp-content` to make sure all users have read + scan on the directories
[13:49:42] <gnarf> detr0it ^
[13:50:10] <gnarf> sigh github outages
[14:10:15] <detr0it> a+rX didn't fix it

[14:38:13] <detr0it> hmm... playing around in the php interpreter, I can't get glob to return an empty array. It either returns an array of matches or bool(false)
[14:42:57] <detr0it> ... and the glob doc says 'Note: On some systems it is impossible to distinguish between empty match and an error."
