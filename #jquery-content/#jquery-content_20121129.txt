[14:29:45] <jzaefferer> that's how you troll scott_gonzalez
[14:33:17] <rworth> ok, so I'll continue working on new-css through next Wed evening (Dec 2) when hopefully we'll get a couple of full-time pro designer help to clean up the last 5-10% I can't do not being a designer
[14:33:54] <ajpiano> ok
[14:33:55] <rworth> s/get a couple of full-time/get a couple days of full-time/
[14:34:00] <ajpiano> are you going to try for api.jquery.com also?
[14:34:08] <rworth> yeah, all live and to-live
[14:34:20] <rworth> so, uis, qunits, learn, and api
[14:34:36] <rworth> and events
[14:35:31] <ajpiano> what about blog.jquery ?
[14:38:01] <rworth> I didn't think we were planning to do any blog work until we did blog consolidation
[14:38:26] <ajpiano> ok
[14:38:45] <ajpiano> i just think it's weird that api.jquery.com is gonna be live with the new theme but jquery.com and blog.jquery.com won't

[14:44:23] <ajpiano> rworth: the last thing i really wanted to get in was displaying the nested content in the sidebar
[14:44:45] <ajpiano> should i just take a stab at something that at least displays it and then we can spruce from there, or is there a reference impl anywhere
[14:49:35] <rworth> you mean in terms of markup?
[14:49:44] <rworth> it'd just be nested lists
[14:49:53] <rworth> but we don't have a design
[14:50:09] <rworth> speaking of don't have a design, we don't have one for the blog, and jquery.com is ready
[14:50:30] <rworth> so it's indeed a question of whether you/we're ok launching api. earlier than those two
[14:50:39] <rworth> could always do a legacy, like jquery.com
[14:51:04] <ajpiano> rworth: blog.jqueryui.com seems ok
[14:51:06] <rworth> meaning Karl et. al would at least be able to forget having to sync changes between WordPress and content repo
[14:51:07] <ajpiano> should work for core too
[14:51:34] <rworth> yeah, I figured that's what we'd go with if we did so now
[14:51:35] <ajpiano> right now on api changes aren't getting synced, api.jquery.com is just out of date
[14:51:56] <rworth> so, we could do api. and blog.
[14:52:40] <ajpiano> ohh, i see what you were saying
[14:52:44] <ajpiano> we do api as a legacy for now
[14:53:16] <ajpiano> the important thing in the short term is to get new-css applied to sites that are actually live as is, and get the most up to date api docs live
[14:53:33] <ajpiano> new-css + new branding
[14:53:49] <rworth> yup
[14:54:19] <rworth> so doing legacy theme solves the concern of having a semi- migrated *.jquery.com
[14:54:24] <ajpiano> so i think legacy api makes the most sense in the immediate short term
[14:54:25] <rworth> while getting new content out
[14:54:29] <rworth> yuo
[14:54:30] <ajpiano> right
[14:54:32] <rworth> yup
[14:54:35] <ajpiano> so let's do that
[14:55:00] <rworth> and thankfully it's *almost* as simple as copy paste the theme folder from the server into web-base-template
[14:55:06] <ajpiano> yep
[14:55:40] <rworth> there will be a tweak or two needed because the old theme works with xml content and the new one works with html, but it's basic markup (as new-css is) and reference the legacy css file
[14:56:48] <ajpiano> ok
[14:56:53] <ajpiano> bbiab!!
[14:56:57] <ajpiano> oh but wait

[14:57:15] <ajpiano> for the menu style
[14:57:19] <ajpiano> it would just be nested lists, indeed
[14:57:34] <ajpiano> it's also not showing right on the index pages
