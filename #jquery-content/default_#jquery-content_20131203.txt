[05:44:03] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Did you leave some debug code on stage? Deploys are failing.
[05:44:22] <scott_gonzalez> We also have a mysterious fail on production api.jquery.com.
[05:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy.
[05:48:28] <scott_gonzalez> The mysterious fail on production is because jq01 is spiking.
[05:48:36] <scott_gonzalez>  load average: 26.06, 24.33, 23.42
[07:49:13] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: everything better now?
[07:49:43] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I haven't tried since the errors.
[07:49:52] <scott_gonzalez> Did you just pull out some debug code on stage?
[07:50:01] <nacin> referring to load averages
[07:50:41] <nacin> stage deploys should work again
[07:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, load average is still way up.
[07:56:38] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf said in -infrastructure a few minutes ago that he was looking into it.
[07:57:40] <gnarf> it's just ‚Ä¶ 
[08:00:07] <gnarf> it's using the cache...
[08:00:31] <gnarf> i think today might just be the melting point

[11:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> Krinkle nacin gnarf: Let's talk about canonical URLs :-)
[11:15:55] <scott_gonzalez> What is the advantage to having the link element present?
[11:17:10] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically in terms of the jQuery sites.
[11:23:40] <gnarf> better for search
[11:23:43] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: two things. 1) avoid duplicate content indexing between http and https.
[11:24:21] <Krinkle> 2) avoid duplicate content indexing between url variations where there is no redirect (e.g. ?p=123, /foo, /foo/, /foo/?blbla=123)
[11:25:25] <Krinkle> it's also a nice way to gradually move to https if we decide to promote that as primary, without actually redirecting (eg. have all search results be in https)
[11:25:32] <Krinkle> but that's a minor case we might not want.
[11:25:37] <scott_gonzalez> Do we have any pages on any sites where this would actually be useful though?
[11:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> Well, Google will only store the HTTPS versions of jquery.org pages anyway, because of the redirects.
[11:28:20] <Krinkle> scott_gonzalez: people do weird things to urls
[11:28:26] <Krinkle> and then share them.
[11:29:41] <Krinkle> ?rdfrom=, ?utm_source=, etc. all kinds of crazy things get added by different tools.
[11:29:52] <Krinkle> and of course manually
