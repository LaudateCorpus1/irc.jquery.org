[08:44:48] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: was curious if you would be able to/want to take a look over https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/blob/special-events/page/events/special-events.md and bring it up to date
[08:45:42] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: yeah i have more docs that i wrote a year ago, i need to resurrect them
[08:45:54] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg even translated them into markdown
[08:46:52] <ajpiano> sweet
[09:10:13] <ajpiano> i still can't believe the number of people who tweet directly at JohnResig to point out jquery bugs
[09:10:50] <ajpiano> this one was particularly awesome https://twitter.com/cmziebarth/status/296456936361164800
[09:10:50] <b-ot> ajpiano: @cmziebarth: @jeresig @jquery http://t.co/tcdT1TG5 yes, some of these selectors that you think people don't actually use *are* actually used
[09:11:51] <gnarf> heh
[09:13:18] <ajpiano> hey so guy
[09:13:19] <ajpiano> guys
[09:13:26] <ajpiano> i pointed this out to rworth a few months ago
[09:13:35] <ajpiano> and he said it wasn't a problem then
[09:13:51] <ajpiano> but i am still kind of feeling like the disclaimer on jquery-wp-content is way too broad
[09:13:54] <ajpiano> https://twitter.com/ekandreas/status/296503772421697536
[09:13:54] <b-ot> ajpiano: @ekandreas: @ericaheinz @jquery @interocc "It is copyrighted. You don't have permission to use it in any way for any purpose, commercial or otherwise."
[09:14:14] <ajpiano> it makes it sound like you aren't allowed to fork it to contribute patches to the site
[09:14:22] <ajpiano> because that fits into "any purpose"
[09:17:51] <johnkpaul> ajpiano: would "personal and commercial use" not cover it?
[09:18:23] <ajpiano> something like that, perhaps
[09:18:53] <johnkpaul> the point is that they can't use the site for their own reasons, but they are free to contribute back to jquery
[09:19:08] <johnkpaul> "any way for any purpose" seems too stringent
[09:21:16] <gnarf> cc legal ?
[09:22:26] <gnarf> I mean my opinion there is - I'm not a laywer - We should word it carefully to allow forking/fixing/contributing, but any fixes should go through CAA instead of CLA, yes?
[09:22:26] <ajpiano> gnarf: yeah i should bring it up at the board meeting
[09:22:37] <ajpiano> no we are doing CLA
[09:22:47] <ajpiano> i'm mostly worried about "any way for any purpose" right now as well
[09:41:25] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: So, umm...we should definitely have legal look at this.
[09:41:32] <ajpiano> yeah, agree
[09:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> We may be bound to GPL.
[09:41:54] <scott_gonzalez> Because, you know, jquery-wp-content is worthless without WordPress and OMG VIRAL
[09:42:24] <ajpiano> as far as i can tell, GPL is more permissive than "you can't use this for any purpose no matter what"
[09:42:26] <ajpiano> :p
[09:42:50] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure how this comes into play.
[09:43:11] <ajpiano> this === ?
[09:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> GPL and building a theme intended not for redistribution.
[09:43:34] <ajpiano> ah
[09:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> Does the GPL automatically make private use also GPL?
[09:43:55] <ajpiano> yea and wordpress was just having a kerfluffle over gpl in themes just recently again
[09:44:10] <scott_gonzalez> SFC has clearly stated that themes are GPL.
[09:44:24] <ajpiano> i do believe so
[09:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> "HP in WordPress themes must be GPL, artwork and CSS may be but are not required."
[09:44:57] <scott_gonzalez> "PHP in WordPress themes must be GPL, artwork and CSS may be but are not required."
[09:45:27] <scott_gonzalez> So, we can probably continue doing what we *want* to be doing, which is not open sourcing our design.
[09:45:43] <ajpiano> i think wordpress themes aren't *required* to be GPL, just that you can't like, be involved in the wordpress community or something if you do make non-GPL themes
[09:45:59] <ajpiano> but i'm not sure
[09:46:39] <ajpiano> nacin probably knows more than us :)
[09:47:15] <nacin> hello
[09:47:33] <ajpiano> i, personally, am much more concerned about people coming to jquery-wp-content and assuming they aren't allowed to fork it and fix site bugs
[09:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: All PHP in jquery-wp-content is required to be GPL, correct?
[09:48:24] <nacin> correct, as it is a derivative work of WordPress.
[09:48:47] <scott_gonzalez> And we can keep the design/CSS unlicensed, correct?
[09:48:58] <scott_gonzalez> As those are not derivative works because they're not processed by WordPress.
[09:49:26] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I can write up a short explanation of this to replace the current wording.
[09:49:32] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: that would be great
[09:49:43] <nacin> Yes. It's something we highly discourage / hate for themes that are distributed, but it's not like you're selling this thing to customers.
[09:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> Right, we don't want it anywhere but our sites.
[09:50:09] <ajpiano> right, this isn't a "theme" it's "our website"
[09:51:46] <scott_gonzalez> And for when people ask: We can't license the PHP as MIT because it doesn't meet the requirements of GPL.
[09:52:01] <scott_gonzalez> This is surely going to confuse people when we constantly say "MIT is GPL-compatible"
[09:52:05] <scott_gonzalez> But it's a one-way street.
[09:55:25] <ajpiano> well we can always put the gobbledyguk and then a plain english explanation of things you can and can't do
[09:57:14] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: correct, MIT isn't copyleft, while GPL is.
[09:58:14] <nacin> simply rewriting "what is not licensed" should be sufficient for you
[10:09:24] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/a936593ac6b286eacf94
[10:09:38] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Thoughts on how to make the last paragraph actually read well and make sense?
[10:14:45] <ajpiano> looking now
[10:19:44] <Mottie> how does that copyright work with the branding documentation (http://brand.jquery.org/)?
[10:20:19] <ajpiano> The design, layout, and look-and-feel of the jquery-wp-content repository, including all CSS, images, and
[10:20:19] <ajpiano> icons, are copyright jQuery Foundation, Inc. or the original copyright holders, and are not licensed for use.
[10:20:20] <Mottie> and the only link to the brand subdomain I could find is in the blog post.
[10:20:47] <ajpiano> the problem is with the word "use" scott_gonzalez :/
[10:21:12] <ajpiano> Mottie: they work... together
[10:21:13] <ajpiano> :)
[10:21:46] <ajpiano> though there may be some rough edges that still need to worked out
[10:21:58] <ajpiano> oh yeah, i meant to add it to the top menu
[10:22:05] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: So drop all the words between use and used.
[10:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> "...not licensed for use on any site..."

[12:39:45] <gnarf> ajpiano: wish i'd been around on the blog post day for the sites writeup
[12:39:54] <ajpiano> why
[12:39:59] <gnarf> woulda told you to add an honorable mention to nginx and fastcgi_cache :)
[12:40:13] <ajpiano> ah
[12:46:58] <gnarf> It's really a huge workhorse
[12:54:02] <gnarf> this doesn't sound that impressive when you limit it this much, but we serve ~35 php page requests (actually sent to wordpress) per second at peak while keeping the CPU load on this single machine around 2
[15:02:59] <nacin> gnarf: what's the actual pages served per sec?
[16:05:36] <danheberden> gnarf, we're going to need to do an infra blog post
[16:06:20] <danheberden> in which, while talking about the challenges and optimizations implemented, we can thank mediatemple for everything
[16:06:35] <danheberden> as well as a mention to vmware for the licenses they gave us
