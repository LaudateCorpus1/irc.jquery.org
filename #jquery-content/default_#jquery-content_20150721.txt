[08:48:12] <gnarf> jzaefferer: you around? i can't seem to publish that tag to npm cc scott_gonzalez 
[08:56:00] <gnarf> (grunt-jquery-content)
[08:58:46] <jzaefferer> gnarf: here now
[08:59:11] <gnarf> jzaefferer: can you publish that for me and/or give me ability to publish?
[08:59:16] <jzaefferer> gnarf: I can make you an owner, what's your npm user?
[08:59:21] <gnarf> gnarf
[09:00:04] <jzaefferer> ah
[09:00:21] <jzaefferer> there
[09:00:39] <jzaefferer> gnarf: while we're here, do you know if jquery-license is automatically deployed when tags are pushed?
[09:00:53] <gnarf> I'm 99% sure
[09:01:08] <jzaefferer> well, I guess I'll find out when I push a tag
[09:01:16] <jzaefferer> it should deploy pretty much instantly, right?
[09:01:38] <gnarf> jzaefferer: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/cla.pp#L28-L41
[09:01:41] <gnarf> yup
[09:01:56] <gnarf> jzaefferer: want to land your qunitjs.com one with 2.3.0 or want me to?
[09:02:13] <jzaefferer> you can land that along with the rest
[09:02:30] <jzaefferer> I guess we should also update api.qunitjs.com to handle the redirects, taking them out of puppet?

[09:04:35] <gnarf> alright, we can do redirects now arthurvr !
[09:04:51] <arthurvr> yippeeee
[09:05:01] <arthurvr> thanks gnarf :)
[09:05:04] <gnarf> jzaefferer: yeah - i want to do a pass and remove a lot of the redirects
[09:05:13] <gnarf> though I intentionally don't support regexp matching 
[09:05:20] <gnarf> only absolute url matches
[09:05:35] <gnarf> so some might require a little research to figure out what actually needs redirecting
[09:06:20] <gnarf> jzaefferer "remove a lot of the redirects"... from the infrastructure and move them to the content repos
[09:08:46] <jzaefferer> yeah, sounds good
[09:09:05] <arthurvr> agcolom AurelioDeRosa: in case you missed it, check those PRs ^
[09:09:18] <jzaefferer> btw. the options DB lookup is a bit questionable, since it happens on every request, but then the whole thing is cached by cloudflare anyway, right?
[09:10:09] <arthurvr> Aurelio isnâ€™t here it seems - Iâ€™ll drop it on the meeting
[09:11:21] <agcolom> arthurvr: which PRs? in infra?
[09:11:57] <arthurvr> agcolom: http://git.io/vmpHk - weâ€™re now able to setup redirects from the site repos
[09:12:30] <agcolom> oh brilliant!!!
[09:14:27] <arthurvr> gnarf: agcolom: I donâ€™t think much content people have infra access so maybe you can send us the necessary parts of the nginx configs so we can try to move them? Or is anyone else going to take care of that? 
[09:17:30] <urghz> Hey everybody
[09:26:19] <gnarf> arthurvr: I can add you to infra repo
[09:26:50] <gnarf> jzaefferer: it only happens on 404's
[09:27:52] <gnarf> arthurvr: you should have access to infra repo now
[09:29:20] <arthurvr> Alright, thanks :) I will try to take care of those asap.
[11:35:25] <gnarf> arthurvr: all the nginx redirects should be here: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/tree/puppet-master/modules/jquery/manifests/wp
[11:35:50] <arthurvr> gnarf: Yeah I catched them, but thanks :)
[11:36:29] <arthurvr> gnarf: Iâ€™m going to do some tomorrow morning, also got a learn article to finish.
[11:36:34] <gnarf> just remember that the 404/redirects code will "tralingslashit" https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/trailingslashit
[11:37:06] <arthurvr> alright
[11:37:18] <gnarf> so the left side of the rewrite should always have a trailing slash to work properly (i think)
[11:37:55] <gnarf> yeah - even if it were lilke /something.html/ 
[11:38:12] <gnarf> maybe I should have made it use "untrailingslashit"
[11:38:46] <arthurvr> yeah maybe, but it doesnâ€™t matter too much.
