[07:23:05] <agcolom> ajpiano: yes, is that bad?
[07:23:16] <ajpiano> nah i had just pinged you earlier
[07:23:29] <ajpiano> i'll pm
[07:23:34] <ajpiano> no it's good btw :)
[07:23:43] <agcolom> oh sorry, I'm at work... have 30 mins to kill, so thought I'd do a bit of this ;-)
[09:33:33] <ajpiano> uch
[09:33:44] <ajpiano> jquery.tmpl
[09:33:49] <ajpiano> makes me want to do harikari
[09:34:32] <ajpiano> if ever there was a piece of stillborn code
[09:34:34] <ajpiano> there it is
[09:34:50] <DaveMethvin> how do we disappear that thang?
[09:36:12] <ajpiano> time travel
[09:37:42] <scott_gonzalez> We just ask ajpiano to update it :-)
[09:38:03] <scott_gonzalez> "Go clean up the issues on jquery.tmpl" "Oh shit, guys..."
[09:38:08] <ajpiano> ahahahah
[09:38:16] <ajpiano> someone post a few issues about laptop batteries
[09:38:21] <ajpiano> that's all the cover i need
[09:38:24] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[09:38:45] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: btw, later today can we catch up a little bit about plugins
[09:39:04] <ajpiano> aaron forsander says he still wants to help with it, i want to get a grasp of what's going on, etc
[09:40:46] <ajpiano> And we need to figure out what veersion of IE we want to support in the theme
[09:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> I thought we were doing IE7+
[09:41:49] <scott_gonzalez> But I've also heard IE8+.
[09:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> What's Google supporting right now?
[09:42:55] <scott_gonzalez> They're pretty aggressive about dropping browser support.
[09:45:26] <ajpiano> http://support.google.com/a/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=33864
[09:45:32] <ajpiano> i think that some of it will depend
[09:45:44] <ajpiano> like right now, there is *no* border around the top nav in ie8
[09:45:51] <ajpiano> we can probably put in something that works in ie7 and 8 there :)
[09:47:10] <scott_gonzalez> Whoa, so they only support IE9+?
[09:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> hold on, I have useful data.
[09:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> All IE = 8% traffic
[09:48:02] <scott_gonzalez> 9 = 50&
[09:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[09:48:13] <scott_gonzalez> 9 = 50%
[09:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> 8 = 34%
[09:48:29] <scott_gonzalez> 10 = 9%
[09:48:37] <scott_gonzalez> 7 = 5%
[09:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> So, supporting IE7 means supporting <0.5% of our visitors.
[09:50:27] <scott_gonzalez> Supporting IE8 means supporting <3% of our visitors.
[09:50:29] <ajpiano> yah
[09:50:44] <ajpiano> i don't think adding a functional header for ie8 is too heavy of a lift though
[09:51:04] <ajpiano> and probably easy enough to handle when i go back and deal with the shadows
[09:51:14] <scott_gonzalez> Opera is 1.57%
[09:51:17] <ajpiano> but i def agree, we shouldn't be going nuts on edge casey bugs esp in ie7
[09:51:19] <scott_gonzalez> Safari is 5.44%
[09:51:42] <scott_gonzalez> So, let's go for IE8 support and see if we run into problems.
[09:51:57] <scott_gonzalez> I think 3% is high enough.
[09:52:05] <ajpiano> yup
[09:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, that's half a million visits per month.
[09:52:42] <scott_gonzalez> Err...quarter million
[09:53:11] <ajpiano> what's 250,000 visits between friends
[09:53:26] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if we drop support, nothing, because they won't be our friends anymore :-P
[09:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> So, when we eventually drop IE8 support, we can start using jQuery 2!
[10:45:31] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hello. I've changed the example... I was wondering whether you could have a look to see whether this is ok? http://users.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/jqm/trymakeUrlAbsolute2.html
[10:45:36] <agcolom> Thank you :-)
[10:47:57] <gnarf> fyi github's postreceive seems broken atm
[10:48:00] <gnarf> no IRC notifications
[10:48:04] <gnarf> no deploy
[10:48:44] <agcolom> gnarf: thanks, yes, I was wondering why my latest change was not there!
[10:49:28] <agcolom> luckily I haven't had much time to do much so far today!
[10:49:32] <gnarf> agcolom: i can push by hand if you want
[10:50:13] <agcolom> I'll have more to do this evening, so maybe best to wait...
[10:50:21] <agcolom> Thanks for the offer :-)
[10:50:48] <gnarf> just ping me if you need it pushed
[10:50:53] <agcolom> I'm making dinner, so I should be able to do some work in about 1h-1.5h

[11:24:40] <ajpiano> good to know jqcommit, i only did that 10 minutes ago
[11:29:00] <gnarf> heh
[11:29:03] <gnarf> mine was hours ago
[11:40:49] <ajpiano> howdy evangoer
[11:40:59] <evangoer> Howdy Adam
[11:41:16] <evangoer> So at the very least, I can do a PR for that one snippet.
[11:41:28] <ajpiano> awesome :)
[11:41:33] <ajpiano> so yeah, i came across your post this morning, and i'd love to kind of bring you up to speed on what we're up to
[11:41:47] <evangoer> Sounds like you are doing a major overhaul
[11:42:01] <ajpiano> indeed
[11:42:10] <ajpiano> at the heart of the matter is that we've open sourced all the docs and webdesign
[11:42:25] <ajpiano> because cms logins and wikis are painful, and using text editors and git is awesome
[11:43:51] <ajpiano> so we're moving to a system where we have a single wordpress network for all the sites
[11:44:01] <evangoer> Agreed 100%. Using a real software workflow & text editors around documentation is way, way better than using wikis and CMSes.
[11:44:10] <ajpiano> but we populate wordpress from static content, using a series of grunt plugins
[11:44:37] <ajpiano> so we have this wordpress setup: http://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content
[11:44:57] <ajpiano> and then a series of content repos, for instance the two i linked you to earlier
[11:45:18] <evangoer> Would it be good enough if I just forked the content repo and sent in a PR with markdown changes, then?
[11:45:19] <ajpiano> and then that works for local development, and our staging and production environments
[11:45:35] <ajpiano> evangoer: for an initial PR, definitely
[11:46:02] <evangoer> alrighty
[11:46:03] <ajpiano> you can stand up the whole environment locally, if in time you should desire it
[11:46:20] <ajpiano> or want to preview locally
[11:46:38] <evangoer> I think for now, that's more than I want to get into. These are just minor wording tweaks.
[11:46:52] <ajpiano> but that's the idea, is that theoreitcally content edits can just be handled in markdown by anyone, without needing a local environment :)
[11:47:05] <evangoer> But I appreciate you guys making it easy to set up a local environment, that's pretty important if you're doing major work.
[11:47:30] <ajpiano> i  trust you found your way to this: https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/blob/master/page/about-jquery/how-jquery-works.md ?
[11:47:37] <evangoer> yup!
[11:47:48] <ajpiano> awesome :)
[11:48:10] <ajpiano> but you probably haven't seen http://stage.learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/ :)
[11:48:38] <evangoer> That, no. Much nicer looking!
[11:48:42] <ajpiano> indeed
[11:48:51] <ajpiano> and any contributions get credited down in the footer !
[11:49:30] <ajpiano> this staging site is updated any time the jquery-wp-content or the learn.jquery.com repo have commits to master, and the changes are deployed to production on a tag of a semvar
[11:49:34] <ajpiano> semver* in either repo
[11:49:50] <ajpiano> so anyhow, i just figured you'd appreciate a bit more context
[11:50:04] <evangoer> That is helpful.
[11:50:21] <ajpiano> and to encourage you to go to town on whatever you should happen to encounter
[11:51:16] <ajpiano> let me know if you have any questions about anything, and hang in here if you like
[11:51:22] <evangoer> sure thing
[11:52:24] <ajpiano> oh, one other thing that's useful

[12:04:10] <ajpiano> evangoer: awesome, catch up with you soon then!

[13:46:24] <ajpiano> i think i'm gonna move contribute over to .org now
[13:46:40] <ajpiano> the sooner the better, impacts fewer people
[13:48:18] <ajpiano> gnarf:  you around?
[13:48:23] <gnarf> ya
[13:49:03] <gnarf> i'll swap it over in puppet if you want to rename it --- nacin, do i need to manually update the sites table to match this rename from .com -> .org or will it fix itself?
[13:49:24] <ajpiano> ok
[13:49:28] <ajpiano> yeah i'm prepping a commit that renames it
[13:51:03] <gnarf> ajpiano: want me to rename the repo?
[13:51:17] <ajpiano> i can do it
[13:51:20] <gnarf> k
[13:51:34] <gnarf> i'll go work on DNS
[13:52:45] <gnarf> ajpiano: should I kill off the .com's or set em up as a redirect?
[13:53:00] <ajpiano> do a redirect
[13:55:12] <ajpiano> gnarf: we are also going to be doing two things to irc
[13:55:18] <ajpiano> moving it to web base template, and moving it to .org
[13:55:33] <ajpiano> so imagine we're gonna have to set up a few redirects there as well
[13:55:38] <ajpiano> just a heads up tho
[13:56:58] <nacin> gnarf: if you do the rename from the network admin, then in the code
[13:57:10] <gnarf> nacin: cool
[13:57:29] <ajpiano> does that mean we should rename it in the network admin, and only then push to master
[13:57:53] <nacin> order not important.
[13:58:02] <ajpiano> oh ok
[13:58:09] <nacin> said "then" cause I thought it might be, but nope
[13:59:10] <rworth> so, folks will have to do the same locally?
[13:59:16] <ajpiano> seems like it
[13:59:22] <ajpiano> i'm doign the rename like, now
[13:59:45] <ajpiano> done
[14:00:07] <rworth> nacin that reminds me, does WordPress have a system we can tie into for redirects, when pages get renamed?
[14:00:11] <nacin> we could do an upgrade routine of sorts locally if we really need to
[14:00:26] <nacin> rworth: automatically occurs for renamed posts. not for pages.
[14:00:38] <rworth> but that get renamed in GitHub?
[14:00:51] <rworth> I'm thinking when we build and deploy after doing a git mv
[14:01:10] <rworth> it has happened before, and it is bound to happen many times in the future
[14:01:13] <rworth> oh, all we have is pages
[14:01:13] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: git remote set-url origin https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org.git
[14:01:18] <rworth> (practically)
[14:01:24] <rworth> so, I guess the answer is no

[14:03:15] <gnarf> ajpiano: did you do the jquery-wp-content commit too?
[14:03:42] <ajpiano> anyone else who has a yeah
[14:03:45] <ajpiano> yeah i did
[14:05:21] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: so do i need to re-push  now?
[14:05:37] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: you'll want to pull
[14:05:42] <ajpiano> but unless you have something to push, nope
[14:06:23] <ajpiano> hm, i definitely missed something
[14:08:12] <ajpiano> not pulling in the sidebar properly anymore
[14:09:20] <ajpiano> it's being reflected on stage the same way
[14:09:21] <ajpiano> http://stage.contribute.jquery.org/
[14:09:27] <ajpiano> so the good news is we set up everything else prpoerly
[14:10:34] <ajpiano> nacin: any idea why it isn't pulling in the sidebar after the rename? i'm pretty sure i hit everything that needed to be hit
[14:11:21] <nacin> ajpiano: the sidebar went missing?
[14:12:02] <nacin> ajpiano: kinda weird
[14:16:53] <ajpiano> nacin:  yep
[14:17:23] <gnarf> ajpiano: gonna try a manual deploy
[14:17:58] <gnarf> not sure why http://contribute.jquery.org/ is a domain mapping error
[14:18:06] <gnarf> oh - havent tagged wp-content
[14:18:07] <gnarf> doh
[14:18:09] <ajpiano> gnarf: contribute.jquery.com was never live
[14:18:14] <ajpiano> it's not meant to be yet
[14:18:47] <ajpiano> manual deploy of j-w-c
[14:18:47] <ajpiano> ?
[14:21:02] <gnarf> ajpiano: the contribute to stage
[14:21:10] <gnarf> the sidebar stuff
[14:21:30] <gnarf> i wonder if we were to change something on the site if it would fix itself
[14:23:52] <ajpiano> no dice
[14:23:56] <ajpiano> i mean, i made some content changes
[14:23:58] <ajpiano> and grunted
[14:28:02] <gnarf> hrm
[14:31:29] <ajpiano> i see a lot of other thigns wrong, i must have done something not quite right
[14:31:57] <gnarf> has the jquery-wp-content been pushed
[14:32:02] <gnarf> i never saw an irc update for it
[14:32:19] <ajpiano> yeah but maybe the hooks didn't execute
[14:32:21] <gnarf> yeah i suppose it was
[14:32:24] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/51cffb557ea2218590e8d4e2ad9547c3688f390c
[14:32:31] <ajpiano> view-source:http://stage.contribute.jquery.org/
[14:32:38] <ajpiano> still referring to contribute.jquery.com folder in the header
[14:32:41] <gnarf> jq01.stage.jquery.com: Deployment: jquery-wp-content.sh 51cffb557ea2218590e8d4e2ad9547c3688f390c
[14:33:25] <ajpiano> gnarf: it also is failing locally
[14:33:26] <ajpiano> the same way
[14:33:32] <ajpiano> so it's not a hook thing it's a wordpress mistake i must have made
[14:33:48] <ajpiano> nacin: get_stylesheet_directory_uri() is still returning the contribute.jquery.com
[14:34:16] <ajpiano> so i must have just not renamed something properly, and it's still looking for the contribute.jquery.com sidebar as well
[14:34:30] <gnarf> cookie domain should prolly be jquery.org 
[14:35:43] <ajpiano> yup

[15:17:38] <ajpiano> you know what's weird
[15:17:47] <ajpiano> that we kept the link to plugins in the header nav for jquery.com all this time
[15:38:22] <ajpiano> yikes https://twitter.com/keithpitt/status/289153526729420800
[15:48:03] <ajpiano> lol rworth
[15:48:07] <ajpiano> i was ttrying to reply to that tweet
[15:48:21] <rworth> :)
[15:48:22] <ajpiano> but my comp froze terribly trying to shut down chrome
[15:48:29] <ajpiano> that i had running for several weeks
[15:48:33] <rworth> just got with DaveMethvin he found the problem and is working on a fix
[15:48:47] <ajpiano> figuring out weird edge case shit with jquery.com legacy theme is a terrible first bug to take a crack at :p
[15:48:51] <rworth> looks like scott_gonzalez missed one commit in his cherry picking (without cherry picking) merge to new-css
[15:48:57] <rworth> yeah
[15:49:16] <rworth> I'm updating the ticket and assigning it to dave so he won't be so adventurous ;)
[15:51:49] <rworth> ajpiano being able to create tickets from tweets in a queue that never could've existed before it pretty nice. I like our setup
[15:53:17] <ajpiano> yeah i always like to see if i can't find their github url and thank them in the intial ticket
[15:53:19] <ajpiano> but yeah, it's sweet
[15:53:51] <ajpiano> twitter is much more useful for bug reports on websites and content than code
[15:54:07] <ajpiano> "this shit is wrong: boom"
[15:56:38] <rworth> yup
[15:57:07] <rworth> just this first week will be a good story to tell in the sites post

[16:34:34] <ajpiano> ah hm
[16:38:35] <ajpiano> will look when i get back, dinner!!!
[17:44:42] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Which commit?
[17:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...that looks like the old code.
[17:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> I fixed that.
[18:00:45] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: You essentially reverted my fix.
[18:01:01] <scott_gonzalez> What was the actual thing that you were trying to restore?
[18:01:42] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: here's what it looked like before i started
[18:01:43] <DaveMethvin> https://twitter.com/keithpitt/status/289153526729420800
[18:01:53] <DaveMethvin> so THAT page is much better
[18:01:58] <scott_gonzalez> So this was limited to the upgrade guide?
[18:02:01] <DaveMethvin> yes
[18:02:03] <DaveMethvin> afaik
[18:02:18] <scott_gonzalez> Because now every page is wrong.
[18:02:20] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[18:02:28] <DaveMethvin> yeah but not AS wrong :D
[18:02:38] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[18:02:51] <DaveMethvin> nobody could miss the probs on that page
[18:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to revert your 2 commits and figure out what needs to be added to fix the upgrade guide.
[18:03:03] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.com is very hard to work on because there's no useful nav.
[18:03:18] <DaveMethvin> that's fine, i didn't realize i'd messed the others up
[18:03:22] <DaveMethvin> just tryna get that fixed
[18:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, what's this jq-primaryContent custom field?
[18:05:39] <DaveMethvin> rworth put that in
[18:06:08] <scott_gonzalez> Weird, so this is pulling in old styles I guess?
[18:06:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'll stick the primary content logic back in.
[18:06:37] <DaveMethvin> whatever gets it looking presentable
[18:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I've got it all fixed up.
[18:09:54] <DaveMethvin> push push lemme see!
[18:10:55] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...there's something strange about the code block on the home page.
[18:10:57] <scott_gonzalez> It's on stage too.
[18:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> Should I debug that too or do you not care?
[18:11:33] <scott_gonzalez> Under the LEARN JQUERY NOW! header.
[18:11:44] <DaveMethvin> you mean the line number
[18:11:45] <DaveMethvin> ?
[18:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> The line number, padding and double border.
[18:12:15] <DaveMethvin> don't bother, this is all getting replaced soon right?
[18:12:19] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[18:12:28] <DaveMethvin> good enough
[18:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> code block in the upgrade guide looks just as bad.
[18:13:13] <DaveMethvin> yeah just noticed that
[18:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> Also visible on stage.
[18:13:16] <DaveMethvin> but eh
[18:13:24] <DaveMethvin> it's readable
[18:13:35] <scott_gonzalez> I can probably get it slightly better with a bit of tweaking.
[18:13:40] <DaveMethvin> and if this is being fixed before monday i'm fine with it
[18:13:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll spend 1 minute on it and see where I can get it.
[18:13:49] <DaveMethvin> cool
[18:16:46] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well, it's better now.
[18:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> Still have a double border on the home page though.

[18:19:14] <DaveMethvin> i think that's fine for now
[18:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want the comments in that code block to actually line up?
[18:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> They seem oddly placed.
[18:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> Since they're not 1 space away and not lined up.
[18:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure what the intention was there.
[18:19:54] <DaveMethvin> they should have lined up, must have gotten messed up at some point

[18:23:48] <scott_gonzalez>     (non-chunked response body) by about 750x. That's not a typo.
[18:24:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm confused about what's going on with jquery.com.
[18:25:13] <scott_gonzalez> It appears to be using different CSS for the code blocks.
[18:25:31] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it hasn't updated yet.
[18:26:35] <scott_gonzalez> That's strange, because the email says that jquery-wp-content is updated.
[18:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> And the headers are gone.
[18:26:55] <scott_gonzalez> So it must've updated.
[18:27:05] <DaveMethvin> it must be "caching"
[18:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> But the border and padding on the code blocks are different.
[18:27:08] * DaveMethvin runs away
[18:27:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well, the *real* problem is gone.
[18:27:41] <DaveMethvin> right, it's readable
[18:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's readable and the header and footer aren't messed up.
[18:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> The header and footer are what I wanted to fix.
[18:28:46] <scott_gonzalez> But without regressing on your fix for the upgrade guide.
[18:28:52] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, time to close my laptop.
[18:29:00] <DaveMethvin> adios my friend

[19:51:09] <rworth> ajpiano I was just reviewing that. I like how it fixes the alignment between the top nav and the content, but I don't think we want to totally kill the shadow on the whole page
[19:51:49] <rworth> because it flattens the page entirely into the background. I think the issue is that the nav just needs the same, and didn't quite have it
[19:54:42] <ajpiano> yeah, we can add some back in, i wanted to accept the dude's commit though
[19:55:15] <rworth> sure
[19:55:23] <rworth> I'll keep working on it then, caus I've almost got it
[19:55:30] <ajpiano> oh sweet, i'll leave it to you
[19:55:44] <ajpiano> i figured out why the jquery ui logo wasn't showing in ie8, lol
[19:56:04] <ajpiano> let's just say this was part of it : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/c1975e318ce8d161d7989b6e4a4c1b03a72916fa :p
[19:56:07] <rworth> just saw your lighter navs (which is what made me realize you landed this - was comparing to stage.) - ui and sizzle seem a little washed out - almost like bleached
[19:56:14] <rworth> while qunit is still too dark :/
[19:56:25] <rworth> haha
[19:56:31] <ajpiano> yeah that was kind of a "conversation starter"
[19:56:38] <rworth> :)
[19:56:38] <ajpiano> rworth: i tried using each theme's "light" color
[19:56:42] <ajpiano> but that was WAY intense
[19:56:55] <rworth> I wondered about that. yeah I didn't try it, but I imagined
[19:57:48] <ajpiano> definitely not the solution
[19:58:02] <ajpiano> i think some sort of gradient will end up being the solution
[19:59:01] <rworth> do we have an issue to track it?
[20:00:05] <ajpiano> i have to create a new one now that #151 is closed
[20:01:25] <ajpiano> man the new jquery ui background is much less intense
[20:01:27] <ajpiano> big upgrade for sure
[20:01:33] <ajpiano> took me a while to get used to it
[20:01:43] <rworth> very much
[20:02:48] <ajpiano> rworth: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/169

[20:03:53] <ajpiano> http://gyazo.com/d3ae217022dfabee6cc6337edd3261ad definitely headed in the right direction though
