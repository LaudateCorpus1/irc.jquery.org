[05:40:49] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: donno if you saw this yesterday -- any chance you can put together an abstract for the ui keynote for jq austin
[05:40:55] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin|away: ping re ^^ :)
[05:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> Sure. How long is the spot?
[05:42:12] <ajpiano> it's 50 mins
[05:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> Are they all that long or just the keynotes?
[05:46:02] <ajpiano> just the keynotes the rest of the talks are 30m
[06:40:58] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is there any reason that XML-RPC deletePost() would skip the trash and do a full delete for a custom post type?
[07:18:23] <agcolom> uGoMobi: do you have a local version of jquerymobile.com (the new site)
[07:18:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: not yet
[07:20:49] <agcolom> ok, it's just that I'm not sure what to do for the best. Currently, ui has a menu on the left, and we don't... now, maybe we don't need it, because we have the demo center... 
[07:20:57] <agcolom> I'm really not sure...
[07:21:15] <agcolom> uGoMobi: will you go to Austin?
[07:21:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am thinking about it
[07:22:04] <agcolom> ok
[07:22:56] <agcolom> I think we should have the developer links just like ui hashttp://jqueryui.com/
[07:23:11] <agcolom> ui has ^ http://jqueryui.com/
[07:23:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah that looks good
[07:24:06] <agcolom> And their front page is quite neat. 
[07:24:07] <uGoMobi> also like to move the roadmap from wiki page to the website
[07:24:26] <uGoMobi> yeah we have work to do there http://stage.jquerymobile.com/ ;)
[07:25:09] <agcolom> We almost have too much on our front page currently, and it would be nice I think to use a left hand-side menu just like ui for the various pages... instead of having a long page with everything... 
[07:25:54] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, so you can see what I'm talking about...
[07:26:29] <agcolom> now, interestingly, http://jquery.com/ has a different approach...
[07:26:59] <uGoMobi> agcolom: did you ask about Austin to see if we can work on it there?
[07:27:03] <uGoMobi> or other reason?
[07:27:03] <agcolom> ok, so I think I'm going to study this... 
[07:27:11] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes 
[07:27:17] <agcolom> (to 1st question ;-) )
[07:27:26] <agcolom> unless that is too late..
[07:27:28] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[07:29:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: my idea is to switch to new WordPress theme for 1.4 final
[07:29:28] <agcolom> yes, when would that be roughly?
[07:29:36] <uGoMobi> but I am sure we can't have everything done before that
[07:30:01] <uGoMobi> hmm... within a month I hope
[07:30:21] <agcolom> whoh... 
[07:30:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we just go with what we have
[07:30:44] <uGoMobi> otherwise we never switch
[07:30:48] <agcolom> sure
[07:31:03] <uGoMobi> and then we can work on improving
[07:31:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: so it would still be nice if we can work on this together in Austin
[07:31:57] <agcolom> right :-)
[07:33:06] <uGoMobi> there will be a UI/Mobile meeting on Thursday which I would like to join of course
[07:33:25] <agcolom> uGoMobi: for the changelog, we can just do what ui does, so just create a changelog folder under pages and then each changelog is an md file under the changelog folder. Seems straightforward
[07:33:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sounds good
[07:34:00] <agcolom> I can do that as soon as I have a changelog file to play with ;-)
[07:34:17] <agcolom> they link to it from the main page.
[07:34:35] <uGoMobi> I will have one tomorrow or Thursday for 1.4 alpha release
[07:34:43] <uGoMobi> it will be HTML
[07:34:49] <uGoMobi> but we can replace that
[07:35:15] <agcolom> yes, I have some experience with the minutes ;-) so that will be easy to do.
[07:35:47] <uGoMobi> I don't recommend doing it manually
[07:35:54] <uGoMobi> we have over 600 commits
[07:36:18] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I've noticed that you have a download folder, and then all the downloadable versions there (on jqueryui.com). Should we do that as well for mobile?
[07:36:21] <uGoMobi> not all of them end up in the changelog of course, bt still
[07:36:41] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes! that is a lot ;-)
[07:37:32] <agcolom> uGoMobi: scott_gonzalez this is what I'm talking about: http://jqueryui.com/download/all/ 
[07:37:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I will convert it to md for you so you have something to put on that page
[07:37:40] <agcolom> uGoMobi: thanks
[07:40:31] <agcolom> we currently have the download page, but the zip files are somewhere else. 
[07:41:03] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You should definitely have a download page. Whether you host zips on the site or not is a project-specific question.
[07:41:24] <scott_gonzalez> For example, core has no special downloads, so it's just the CDN releases that matter.
[07:41:52] <scott_gonzalez> For Mobile, you probably want to have zips.
[07:42:14] <agcolom> they are currently on code.jquery.com/etc...
[07:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, you need to get those off of code.
[07:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> Zips do not belong there.
[07:43:38] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ^ 
[07:44:01] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: how about .css and .js?
[07:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> Also, why are we hosting demos on the CDN?
[07:44:21] <scott_gonzalez> CSS and JS have to be on code. If they weren't, what would be there?
[07:44:29] <uGoMobi> demos are on view
[07:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.1/demos/index.html
[07:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> We need to stop doing that.
[07:45:06] <uGoMobi> o_O
[07:45:11] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hey, don't have a go at me. I'm just discovering what is there ;-)
[07:45:32] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: code.jquery.com is our CDN.
[07:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We need to do some serious cleanup of the mobile directory before switching to the new CDN.
[07:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: If we do it now, we can just rewrite history and keep the repo smaller.
[07:49:19] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: 1.2.1 demos are at http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.1/ as well so I have no idea why they are on the CDN
[07:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> Me neither. They need to go away.
[07:55:35] <agcolom> uGoMobi: will we have upgrade guides?
[07:56:09] <scott_gonzalez> I would highly recommend having upgrade guides.
[07:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> And don't skimp on them either.
[07:56:52] <agcolom> especially between 1.3 and 1.4 there will be lots of important changes, so we say the answer is yes then !
[07:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> Writing them is time consuming.
[07:57:22] <scott_gonzalez> But much less time consuming than answering a million question in the forums.
[07:57:28] <agcolom> but the time spent writing them is time save answering the same questions many times ;-)
[07:57:29] <agcolom> ?
[07:57:40] <uGoMobi> agcolom: of course I am in favor of adding those, but like scott_gonzalez says... time
[07:57:41] <agcolom> you beat me ;-)
[07:58:08] <agcolom> I hink we should use the same Dev links as UI
[07:59:16] <agcolom> uGoMobi: maybe I can help with the writing... if you tell me what to write, and I can do (if that makes sense)
[07:59:26] <agcolom> do it ^
[07:59:59] <uGoMobi> agcolom: any help will be appreciated :)
[08:00:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: and yeah, UI's dev links look good
[08:00:19] <uGoMobi> and I like consistency between projects
[08:01:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: so basically we should say... we make the Mobile website exactly the same as UI unless there is a good reason to do something different
[08:01:48] <agcolom> That's what I'd be inclined to say, yes
[08:02:07] <agcolom> or a mix between ui and core... 
[08:03:08] <agcolom> how about I play around with it... and see what happens?
[08:04:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I totally trust you with this :)
[08:04:09] <uGoMobi> go play around with :)
[08:04:22] <uGoMobi> let me know when you run into issues
[08:04:47] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[08:05:11] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: sorry last question: I can't find the css for the mobile or the ui sites? 
[08:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> They're in jquery-wp-content/themes/
[08:05:35] <agcolom> of course! sorry!
[08:07:26] <agcolom> oh, so I need a local version of that as well!!!
[08:09:28] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: turns out deletePost() deletes custom post types. Only posts and pages get the oh-wait-trash-first treatment.
[08:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: weird
[08:09:40] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: it's inside wp_delete_post() itself.
[08:09:48] <scott_gonzalez> The admin UI still goes through the trash process.
[08:10:05] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: indeed. we should just add that flag to XML-RPC.
[08:10:35] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: trash was tacked on to the existing APIs back in 2.9. It was a little funky but it was decided that wp_delete_post() (the actual API) should trash, rather than delete, by default.
[08:15:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you mind informing RWhitbeck that you are working on the new site when he is around?
[08:16:16] <agcolom> uGoMobi: sure, no problem. 
[08:16:22] <uGoMobi> thanks
[08:22:16] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: http://jquery.com/'s footer shows 1.10.1, not 1.10.2.
[08:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> That's because DaveMethvin still hasn't figured out how to add an item to his release checklist :-P
[08:23:04] <nacin> hah.
[08:23:15] <nacin> I almost accidentally downgraded WP trunk.
[08:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[08:23:29] <DaveMethvin> yeah my item is, "remove version-specific download from footer"
[08:23:58] <nacin> Why isn't this automated? Seems like it should pull from the same as the top of the homepage - except it has to wait for google to update?
[08:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, has to wait for Google.
[08:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> But when we change CDNs, we can start pointing to our CDN in the footer.
[08:24:31] <DaveMethvin> i'd really prefer to send people to our download page where it explains CDNs, Migrate, 1.x vs 2.x etc
[08:24:50] <nacin> so what if we checked google hourly, and until google updates, it links to code.jquery.com
[08:25:16] <nacin> DaveMethvin: okay, certainly makes sense. but it's such a pretty design element. :-P
[08:25:21] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: That's fine with me. I don't see any reason to have the CDN URLs on EVERY SINGLE PAGE.
[08:26:07] <nacin> I'm guessing the idea for this came out of a design, not anything in particular.
[08:26:11] <DaveMethvin> it just makes me nervous that someone will see the "easy link" and miss the important info
[08:35:59] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I have jquery-wp-content locally. If I change style.css in theme/jquerymobile.com, can I jsut do grunt deploy inside jquerymobile.com repo and it should pick up the changes? (currently I have a rule in style.css which doesn't get picked up, in uses the one from base.css). Am I missing a step?
[08:55:10] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: There is no step. Changes are instant.
[08:55:33] <agcolom> strange, It's not picking up style.css only base.css
[08:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> Do you see style.css getting loaded?
[08:58:25] <agcolom> yes, it is and it's the non updated one
[09:00:48] <agcolom> I opened it in a tab, it was the old one. I did a refresh, it's the new one, but not on the page... Can I force the page to refresh the style.css?
[09:00:57] <scott_gonzalez> Just refresh.
[09:01:10] <agcolom> I've been refreshing a few times ;-)
[09:01:38] <agcolom> I'm going to try to clear the cache...
[09:02:18] <agcolom> stupid browser cache!
[09:08:21] <agcolom> what is WIP build?
[09:09:09] <agcolom> is it like "latest" or master (unstable)?
[09:40:03] <agcolom> ok, not sure who this is for, but I've just had a look at http://forum.jquery.com/
[09:41:05] <agcolom> We should have the mobile icons on the mobile discussion forums. Also, the distinction between the two mobile discussion forums is not clear to me from their description...
[09:41:28] <agcolom> so one is: Issues related to the development of jQuery Mobile. 
[09:42:34] <agcolom> sorry, maybe the description is ok... 
[09:43:33] <agcolom> I just find ui is much clearer: using jQuery UI / developing jQuery UI
[09:49:23] <agcolom> uGoMobi: is this the link we should use for the roadmap? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Roadmap
[09:50:06] <agcolom> and also, do we have a Development Planning Wiki
[09:50:08] <agcolom> ?
[09:50:12] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15dmethvin opened issue #345: Note that JS-initiated change does not trigger change event  02http://git.io/-cJkBw
[09:51:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I want to add the roadmap to the wesite instead of repo
[09:52:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: when 1.4 is done I will work on need roadmap
[09:52:03] <agcolom> yes, I think that'd be better too
[09:52:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: can you create an empty page for now
[09:52:42] <uGoMobi> or a message that we will add a new roadmap soon
[09:52:44] <agcolom> ok, so I'll use the github link for now and then we'll change it to its new location when it exists....
[09:52:54] <agcolom> or sorry, just missed that ;-)
[09:52:55] <agcolom> yes
[09:53:44] <uGoMobi> np, thanks
[09:53:57] <agcolom> may seem like a stupid question, will the roadmap only ever be on file?
[09:54:39] <agcolom> because the roadmap changes... 
[09:54:59] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: are you planning on moving your roadmap to jqueryui.com at some point?
[09:55:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom: there should always be only one version, one file
[09:55:10] <agcolom> right.
[09:55:11] <agcolom> thanks
[10:00:09] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: no

[11:33:49] <rworth> whoo
[11:33:52] <ajpiano> i made a temporary small long
[11:33:54] <ajpiano> small logo
[11:34:03] <ajpiano> waiting on a finished one from ocupop
[11:34:14] <rworth> ajpiano can you fix the spelling of Radisson in the top banner?
[11:34:16] <ajpiano> but i like, redid the header so it isn't just an image of text etc
[11:34:26] <ajpiano> rworth: i did that and a lot more
[11:34:30] <rworth> awesome. thanks
[11:35:02] <ajpiano> i just need abstracts from DaveMethvin and scott_gonzalez, to write a little fodder above the program
[11:35:35] <ajpiano> and possibly the logo for ocupop
[11:35:40] <DaveMethvin> i will trade you ajpiano, an abstract for your marketing dept budget :)
[11:35:41] <ajpiano> but i don't really want to wait until thursday
[11:35:52] <ajpiano> oh man
[11:35:54] <DaveMethvin> i will get you that abstract now, coming in your email
[11:36:30] <ajpiano> ok
[11:36:44] <ajpiano> thanks for the reminder for the budget stuff, i will certainly try to get it done by fri in that case
[11:37:05] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: i may have trouble meeting the week of the 29th
[11:37:10] <ajpiano> i'm going to be traveling and at a conf
[11:37:35] <ajpiano> rworth: do you think ocupop will mind if we like
[11:37:35] <DaveMethvin> ok, we could maybe do it on skype or even just email
[11:37:42] <ajpiano> go live w/ my hacked together logo thing
[11:37:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to talk about stuffs.
[11:37:47] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: yea i think i could prob do a skype
[11:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> The words UI and Mobile will most certainly be mentioned.
[11:38:36] <rworth> ajpiano you mean just until they get us something?
[11:38:54] <DaveMethvin> i'm gonna do a technical one on jQuery performance and how to not write slow code
[11:39:29] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: awesome
[11:39:58] <ajpiano> rworth: yeah, just until we get something better
[11:40:07] <DaveMethvin> all my examples of bad code will come from https://github.com/ajpiano
[11:40:24] <rworth> I think that works
[11:40:30] <ajpiano> it's mostly english on there
[11:40:52] <ajpiano> rworth: this is what the header looks like http://gyazo.com/cdc3a88d6d27a399a18ee5dfd958e397
[11:40:57] <ajpiano> for narrow screens
[11:41:16] <ajpiano> i made the schedule and speakers one block and it's all responsive so there won't be any bullshit like the terrible calendar last time on mobile

[12:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Is this good enough?
[12:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> Big changes are coming to jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile this year as the projects start to merge. We'll take a look at what's changing and how we're going to make integration with both projects easier for developers.
[12:49:05] <ajpiano> We'll take a look at why we've undertaken this effort, what's changing, and...
[12:49:08] <ajpiano> that works

[12:57:46] <agcolom> uGoMobi: on http://stage.jquerymobile.com/ under the How to Get Involved heading, I think the link to github, the forum and the blog are unnecessary as these links are part of the footer anyway
[12:58:08] <agcolom> what do you think?
[12:58:41] <agcolom> also I'll replace Todd's name and email with yours. What email address would you like me to use?
[12:59:55] <agcolom> btw I have no idea why the lis (manufacturers) are showing with a bullet point! 
[13:00:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: i am taking a look now
[13:02:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah we don't need those links in a list there
[13:03:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we can always add links in the text on the contribute page if applicable
[13:03:31] <agcolom> yes, I agree.
[13:03:47] <uGoMobi> where will my name and email be shown?
[13:04:05] <uGoMobi> oh I see it now
[13:04:09] <agcolom> :-)
[13:05:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: &#106;&#097;&#115;&#112;&#101;&#114;&#064;&#117;&#103;&#111;&#109;&#111;&#098;&#105;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;
[13:05:23] <uGoMobi> ;)
[13:05:28] <agcolom> ??
[13:05:33] <agcolom> what is that??
[13:05:40] <uGoMobi> jasper at ugomobi dot com but encoded
[13:05:46] <agcolom> oh!
[13:05:59] <uGoMobi> don't like spam
[13:06:07] <agcolom> sure
[13:06:15] <uGoMobi> http://www.wbwip.com/wbw/emailencoder.html
[13:06:20] <agcolom> is that how it should go?
[13:06:25] <agcolom> (in the html?)
[13:06:42] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:06:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: oh wait
[13:07:08] <uGoMobi> it's not the text of the link
[13:07:11] <agcolom> no
[13:08:35] <uGoMobi> doing a quick test here
[13:09:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: works http://jsbin.com/edeluh/36/edit
[13:09:28] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:10:13] <uGoMobi> maybe I have to encode mailto: as well
[13:10:16] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:11:20] <agcolom> nice one ;-)
[13:11:38] <uGoMobi> I am afraid spam bots already figured out what mailto looks like encoded but....
[13:11:40] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/edeluh/36/edit
[13:11:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: in there is the correct link ^^
[13:15:48] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we have to check with Richard what we should do we project sponsors logos
[13:16:05] <agcolom> yes...
[13:16:08] <uGoMobi> s/we/with/
[13:16:34] <uGoMobi> maybe things changed a bit when jQuery became a foundation
[13:16:39] <uGoMobi> but I am not sure
[13:16:45] <agcolom> yes, I have no idea!
[13:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom uGoMobi rworth: I don't think corporate sponsors should be contacting the project lead. They should be contacting the Executive Director.
[13:17:55] <agcolom> right, ok. We can change that.
[13:18:11] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: I agree
[13:18:52] <agcolom> it looks also like the content on the contribute page is crazy old!
[13:19:02] <agcolom> "This is the first alpha release of the framework and there will surely be bugs in your platform of choice." 
[13:19:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I didn't look at the text, thought my email was for contacting the project lead about contributing (development)
[13:19:27] <uGoMobi> ouch
[13:19:37] <agcolom> yeah!
[13:20:21] <scott_gonzalez> Our web sites should never tell someone to contact someone via a personal email address.
[13:20:33] <agcolom> I am not too sure whether we need that contribute page actually
[13:21:12] <scott_gonzalez> It should definitely go away.
[13:21:18] <scott_gonzalez> We have contribute.jquery.org
[13:21:32] <agcolom> suits me. 
[13:21:56] <uGoMobi> me too! (no spam :P)
[13:22:01] <agcolom> also, all the links are either in the footer, or in the dev links 
[13:22:24] <agcolom> consider the contribute page gone then!
[13:22:39] <uGoMobi> great
[13:24:25] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do you think it'd be ok to keep "<p>The jQuery Foundation is financed entirely by donations and contributions from the jQuery community. Please support the project: <a href="http://jquery.org/donate">Make a donation</a> or contact the Executive Director about corporate sponsorship opportunities?
[13:24:45] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[13:25:11] <agcolom> and the Executive director goes to Richard's email?
[13:26:22] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am not sure if the "How to get involved" heading should stay
[13:26:41] <agcolom> yes, that seems wrong now as well
[13:27:37] <uGoMobi> that's why I didn't even notice it was about supporting the project/foundation
[13:28:30] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Not to his direct email. It needs to go to a generic email. You'll need to ask rworth what that is.
[13:28:40] <scott_gonzalez> It needs to be an email that will work regardless of who the ED is.
[13:28:46] <rworth> we don't have one
[13:29:07] <rworth> info@ or membership@ are the closest to that
[13:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: We should probably have something on jquery.org about how to become a sponsor.
[13:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps just some text at the bottom of https://jquery.org/sponsors/
[13:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> Or even a sentence in the banner of that page.
[13:39:51] <agcolom> yes, I think that's missing and would be a good idea to add. 
[13:41:38] <agcolom> right, getting too tired now, so I'll keep that for tomorrow...
