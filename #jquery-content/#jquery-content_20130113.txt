[09:51:42] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: yt?
[09:56:45] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin, scott_gonzalez: We somehow lost the "Deprecated" category from api.jquery.com in the update. 
[09:59:49] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin, scott_gonzalez: I'd like to set up a Deprecated category the same way we have Version set up â€” e.g. <category slug="deprecated/1.8"/> â€”but grunt-wordpress isn't creating the 1.8 subcategory when I add it locally (in categories.xml). Can you give me a hand?

[11:00:45] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: you around now?
[11:06:48] <DaveMethvin> yep, i'm on a plane!
[11:06:51] <DaveMethvin> sup?
[11:06:53] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: 
[11:07:09] <kswedberg> hey!
[11:07:57] <kswedberg> I was wondering if you could take a look at http://stage.api.jquery.com/jquery.parsehtml/ and either give it your blessing or let me know what I should fix
[11:09:14] <DaveMethvin> sure! thanks. I'll look at it now, i have about 30 minutes of battery
[11:09:43] <kswedberg> cool. thx!
[11:11:10] <kswedberg> Also, when you have time, I added .finish() to a jquery-1.9 branch: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/commit/db98c259d433e3f04072673a65154801abf3cdc8
[11:11:19] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin â†‘
[11:11:36] <DaveMethvin> ok, i'll look at that too
[11:12:18] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg: on parseHTML i want to add some more background there about when and why parseHTML should be used vs $() ... but it is correct as it is now
[11:12:41] <DaveMethvin> i can edit the page, if there's a ticket for that just assign it to me
[11:13:23] <danheberden> ugh just finally got to the root of my problems scott_gonzalez
[11:13:42] <danheberden> when changing from web-base-template to jquery-wp-content, one needs to wipe the db
[11:14:09] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: actually, you are already assigned: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/59 :)
[11:14:18] <danheberden> i think i'll update the readme for those that need to migrate, scott_gonzalez
[11:14:21] <kswedberg> danheberden: I didn't have to
[11:14:31] <danheberden> kswedberg: really?
[11:14:35] <DaveMethvin> kswedberg:  there needs to be a nag function
[11:14:45] <danheberden> cuz i'm getting this: http://danheberden.com/share/b111b.png
[11:15:02] <danheberden> and no matter what i do, i can't get wp to change themes
[11:15:10] <danheberden> it's like it knows it's there, but doesn't know what themes or something
[11:15:12] <danheberden> it's weird
[11:15:40] <danheberden> kswedberg: what all did you do? i just added the directory and changed wp-config.php
[11:16:37] <ajpiano> danheberden: i didn't have to either
[11:17:07] <ajpiano> i just renamed web-base-template to jquery-wp-content, and change wp-config.php
[11:17:09] <kswedberg> I changed the name of the directory from web-base-template to jquery-wp-content and then I changed wp-config.php in the parent directory.
[11:17:09] <kswedberg> require( dirname( __FILE__ ) . '/jquery-wp-content/config.php' );
[11:17:32] <danheberden> kswedberg: hmm, maybe i have a different problem then
[11:17:44] <danheberden> ajpiano: ok, it must be the theme itself then
[11:18:05] <kswedberg> danheberden: which site are you trying to get to work?
[11:18:29] <danheberden> local.jquery.com
[11:19:03] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/bf98e.png
[11:19:07] <danheberden> results in a blank page
[11:20:52] <ajpiano> what if you don't speciy any template
[11:21:09] <ajpiano> danheberden: i'll do a screenshare w/ you in a few mins if you want
[11:21:26] <danheberden> hmmm nothing
[11:21:36] <danheberden> ajpiano: 
[11:21:41] <danheberden> is there something required in the theme dir
[11:21:44] <danheberden> that i'm not aware of?
[11:22:00] <ajpiano> there shouldn't be ?
[11:22:14] <danheberden> like, is a style.css required?
[11:22:16] <danheberden> with the commends?
[11:22:19] <danheberden> *comments
[11:22:38] <danheberden> it looks like all the other folders/themes have that
[11:22:41] <ajpiano> i assume you cleared out the original legacy jquery theme?
[11:22:44] <ajpiano> yes that is required i think
[11:23:56] <danheberden> ajpiano: i think there's some problems in wp with what WAS there 
[11:23:58] <danheberden> and what IS there
[11:24:38] <ajpiano> hrm
[11:24:46] <ajpiano> lemme watch the last 40 seconds of this half
[11:24:51] <ajpiano> and then we'll get on screen share and figure this the fuck out
[11:25:09] <danheberden> ajpiano: take your time, i'm just investigating
[11:25:40] <danheberden> when you're done, check out your local.jquery.com/wp-admin and see what you have for this: http://danheberden.com/share/8af8ce2.png
[11:25:49] <danheberden> (or anyone else if you have time)
[11:26:23] <danheberden> and then enable themes link: http://danheberden.com/share/fe95.png
[11:31:46] <ajpiano> danheberden: oh hm, i had something similar happen (maybe) with contribute.jquery.org when i renamed it from .com
[11:31:52] <ajpiano> it *said* it was enabled, but it actually wasn't
[11:34:28] <danheberden> ajpiano: http://danheberden.com/share/a534.png
[11:34:36] <danheberden> it says i have jquery-com enabled
[11:34:41] <danheberden> i can even preview it, which works
[11:34:42] <danheberden> lol
[11:34:52] <danheberden> i feel like i should just nuke the db and start over
[11:36:30] <ajpiano> yeah i mean, nuking the db is pretty low cosequences
[11:36:36] <ajpiano> i do it on the reg
[11:36:44] <ajpiano> im good to skype tho now
[11:36:45] <ajpiano> if you want
[11:37:02] <kswedberg> danheberden: looks like I have a similar issue. I'm not even seeing jquery-com in the list of themes in Network Admin
[11:37:06] <ajpiano> danheberden: i have that error
[11:37:20] <ajpiano> as well
[11:38:10] <danheberden> interesting
[11:38:19] <danheberden> i feel another index file is essential here
[11:38:28] <danheberden> the thing is
[11:38:30] <danheberden> it WAS working
[11:38:32] <danheberden> for, like, a while
[11:38:39] <danheberden> until i tried to make a home.php
[11:38:53] <danheberden> at least i finally made my admin password 'secret'
[11:38:54] <danheberden> lol
[11:39:12] <ajpiano> i think it's definitely a bit confused by the lack of a style.css
[11:39:16] <danheberden> ok better so far http://danheberden.com/share/bb8c51a.png
[11:39:29] <ajpiano> oh hey now you're cookin with gas
[11:39:42] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/1ea0.png
[11:40:04] <ajpiano> ah, what'd you do
[11:40:06] <ajpiano> you should be good to roll now
[11:40:47] <kswedberg> ajpiano: lol. I just noticed the lack of style.css in jquery.com theme.
[11:40:55] <danheberden> yay and theme changes work now
[11:40:56] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/09294.png
[11:41:01] <danheberden> like, to full width
[11:41:03] <danheberden> ok, i'm good now
[11:41:09] <danheberden> yeah, installing without the style.css
[11:41:13] <danheberden> i don't think ever registers the theme
[11:41:17] <danheberden> or something
[11:41:18] <ajpiano> ah
[11:41:22] <ajpiano> stupid legacy theme
[11:41:27] <danheberden> i'm sure nacin would be able to verify that
[11:41:34] <ajpiano> it's gonna be amazing to have jquery.com not look like a... turd
[11:44:36] <danheberden> do we have psds for the art work, ajpiano
[11:44:36] <danheberden> ?
[11:45:03] <danheberden> things like the css3, cross browser, etc images aren't in the base theme 
[11:45:11] <danheberden> i thought scott_gonzalez had said all the images were there
[11:45:20] <ajpiano> uh, nope
[11:45:25] <danheberden> yay
[11:45:25] <ajpiano> not that i know of, at least
[11:45:33] <ajpiano> yea :/
[11:45:34] <danheberden> okie dokie
[11:45:48] * danheberden opens mspaint
[11:45:50] <ajpiano> hah
[11:45:56] <danheberden> DONT WORRY GUIZE I GOTS THIS
[11:46:02] <ajpiano> i i can halpman
[11:46:06] <ajpiano> if you want me to help with the assets
[11:46:23] <danheberden> i need to start keeping my okcupid tabs in a separate browser
[11:46:36] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/5254eb.png
[11:47:24] <ajpiano> loooooool
[11:56:46] <danheberden> ajpiano: what min iE are we targeting?
[11:56:53] <ajpiano> ie8
[11:57:15] <ajpiano> though if there's something really egregious in ie7 i suppose we'd fix it if it was easily fixable
[11:57:19] <ajpiano> but our ie7 users is really lwo
[11:57:47] <danheberden> ok great
[11:57:49] <danheberden> <3z
[11:59:45] <ajpiano> argh
[12:00:05] <ajpiano> that just reminded me to check a change scott_gonzalez made the other day in ie8
[12:00:13] <ajpiano> which indeed is borked
[12:00:15] <ajpiano> but i think it's an easy fix
[12:07:29] <kswedberg> ajpiano: I just cloned contribute.jquery.org and tried to set it up. ran npm install and then grunt, but got wordpress-validate error: Error: Unknown error. Please ensure that your database server is running and WordPress is functioning properly.
[12:07:36] <kswedberg> any ideas?
[12:07:42] <ajpiano> you didn't change yo config.json
[12:08:40] <kswedberg> yes, I did. 
[12:09:23] <ajpiano> hrm
[12:09:30] <kswedberg> did I have to use local.contribute.jquery.org or can it be dev.* like the rest of my sites?
[12:09:36] <ajpiano> oh um
[12:09:46] <ajpiano> yeah i didn't realise you were still in dev.* land
[12:10:04] <kswedberg> yeah. when I tried to do local.* it no workie
[12:10:06] <ajpiano> you *should* be able to use dev.* but you'll have to add it into your hosts manually then
[12:10:59] <kswedberg> yeah, did that.
[12:11:39] <ajpiano> and your other local sites are deploying alright?
[12:11:57] <ajpiano> and you have the same creds in the config.jsons
[12:12:15] <kswedberg> yep
[12:12:42] <ajpiano> uhmm
[12:13:56] <ajpiano> i assume you have the most current jquery-wp-content?
[12:14:18] <ajpiano> also what happens if you go to dev.contribute.jquery.org in your browser
[12:15:04] <kswedberg> yeah. http://swedberg.us/i/Screenshot_1_13_13_3_14_PM.png
[12:15:20] <ajpiano> hrmmm
[12:16:21] <ajpiano> did you do dscacheutil -flushcache after updating hosts?
[12:16:29] <ajpiano> though i guess if it's resolving in the browser it should be ok
[12:17:26] <kswedberg> hrmm. that didn't help. btw, I'm now getting "Error: Unable to connect to WordPress."
[12:17:49] <kswedberg> different error, for no apparent reason. (started before the flush cache)
[12:18:03] <ajpiano> that's strange
[12:18:16] <ajpiano> fwiw i feel like it would be good to not be using the dev.* anymore
[12:18:28] <kswedberg> holy crap.
[12:18:32] <ajpiano> this way we're up to date w/ what a new contrib off the street would be using
[12:18:32] <ajpiano> wat
[12:19:16] <kswedberg> i had changed the url in config.json back to local.*. just changed it back to dev.* and it's working
[12:20:02] <ajpiano> ah :)
[12:20:06] <ajpiano> i had a feeling it was something in the config
[12:21:07] <kswedberg> yeah. it was just weird because I could have sworn that i had originally tried with dev.* to no avail
[12:21:16] <kswedberg> oh well. it's working. so, yay
[12:21:30] <ajpiano> hoooray!
[12:22:39] <kswedberg> :) so next questionâ€¦ 
[12:22:55] <ajpiano> opk
[12:26:04] <ajpiano> kswedberg: ?

[12:32:18] <ajpiano> ok
[13:09:37] <danheberden> ajpiano: where is the jqredesign actually stored?
[13:09:47] <danheberden> or, rather, where should i put these ai/psd files
[13:10:16] <ajpiano> danheberden: put them in dropbox for now
[13:10:31] <danheberden> ok, i shuold be more specific
[13:10:33] <ajpiano> we're gonna create a repo for psd and vector assets
[13:10:35] <danheberden> the jqredesign files that are in dropbox
[13:10:39] <danheberden> WHERE in dropbox are those
[13:10:49] <danheberden> :p
[13:10:51] <ajpiano> hold on 1 sec danheberden, on the phone
[13:10:55] <danheberden> k
[13:10:58] <ajpiano> are you talking about the bit.ly/jqredesign
[13:11:03] <danheberden> yeah
[13:11:09] <danheberden> but, like, if we have a place for this stuff
[13:11:10] <danheberden> specifically
[13:11:15] <danheberden> like in the jq one
[13:11:43] <ajpiano> cause those aren't in the jq dropbox, lol
[13:11:48] <danheberden> haha
[13:12:12] <danheberden> you guys sure you want an ocd person helping out with this stuff?
[13:12:15] <danheberden> ha
[13:12:21] <ajpiano> haha
[13:12:27] <ajpiano> ok let me finish this call
[13:13:02] <danheberden> IMMA LET U FINISH
[13:37:34] <ajpiano> aaaaalright danheberden
[13:37:40] <ajpiano> so what were we trying to figure out
[13:37:46] <ajpiano> where to put the psd assets you've created in the last little bit?
[13:38:20] <danheberden> ajpiano: yup
[13:38:42] <ajpiano> oh damn so it turns out all the stuff 47m gave us is in the jQuery Dropbox as well
[13:38:51] <ajpiano> in Foundation-> Redesigns
[13:39:24] <ajpiano> danheberden: i'd say that temporarily you should put any other psd/ai shit you do there as well
[13:39:35] <ajpiano> and then we're gonna create a new github repo for all the stuff
[13:39:41] <ajpiano> psd/AI/eps
[13:39:59] <danheberden> sounds great
[13:47:32] <danheberden> welp, got the ai work done at least
[13:47:55] <ajpiano> sweet
[13:52:56] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/8841.png
[13:53:24] <ajpiano> dang you recreated those from scratch?
[13:53:33] <danheberden> aye
[13:53:37] <ajpiano> nice
[13:53:47] <danheberden> well, i grabbed a free earth vector
[13:53:53] <danheberden> because i wasn't about to recreate THAT from scratch
[13:53:54] <danheberden> lol
[13:53:58] <ajpiano> it's funny when you have that "fuck it, i know photoshop and illustrator" moment
[13:54:04] <ajpiano> i did the same thing for the damn navigation sprite
[13:54:06] <danheberden> haha
[13:54:14] <ajpiano> couldn't find the original, and i was just like...............this must be doen
[13:54:31] <danheberden> yeah, someone someday will thank you so much

[13:54:43] <ajpiano> precisely
[13:54:45] <danheberden> Who better to please?
