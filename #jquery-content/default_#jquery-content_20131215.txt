[14:16:06] <gseguin> darn!
[14:16:19] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I guess that means it worked
[14:16:38] <gseguin> sorry I forgot to comment out the push :-X
[14:16:50] <gseguin> I'll revert the commit
[14:16:56] <agcolom> gseguin: I am now, but getting kids to bed...
[14:17:31] <agcolom> you need help with something?
[14:17:52] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: can we add a swith to not push to github for testing?
[14:18:02] <gseguin> agcolom: I wanted to validate your email address
[14:18:33] <agcolom> sure
[14:18:41] <agcolom> how do we do that?
[14:18:55] <agcolom> is that for the repo?
[14:19:21] <agcolom> (I think I had it wrong and then we fixed it with scott_gonzalez in Amsterdam)

[14:27:54] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Did you look at the PR?
[14:28:04] <gseguin> yeah I was commenting on it
[14:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> It says "For review/testing by @gseguin.
[14:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> Still needs a guard for test runs."
[14:28:15] <gseguin> I just realized the meaning of your second sentece
[14:28:23] <gseguin> I'm very sorry
[14:28:53] <gseguin> anyway to remove these 2 commits?
[14:28:58] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: ^
[14:29:24] <scott_gonzalez> reset and force push
[14:29:34] <gseguin> do you mind ?
[14:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it'll screw up any of the infrastructure.
[14:29:59] <gseguin> do you want me to do it or have you lost all trust ? ;)
[14:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> You can do it.
[14:31:39] <gseguin> done
[14:31:51] <jqcommit> 01[13codeorigin.jquery.com01] 15gseguin 04force-pushed 06master from 1438d4773 to 1414de357: 02http://git.io/b0TCBg
[14:31:54] <gseguin> again I'm sorry
[14:32:23] <scott_gonzalez> That's what we get for not having the guard in yet :-/
[14:33:25] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's good that it's working.
[14:33:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'll add the guard and land that plus the other PR after the kids go to bed.
[14:33:59] <gseguin> ok
[14:34:02] <gseguin> sounds good
[14:34:20] <gseguin> I'm hoping I can use/test it for 1.4
[14:34:49] <gseguin> it probably won't send the email to google just yet but it'll do everything else
[14:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: What do you think about me making a repo at scottgonzalez/fake-jquery-cdn
[14:36:17] <scott_gonzalez> And for test releases, it'll just use that instead of the real one.
[14:36:21] <scott_gonzalez> It'll just be an empty repo.
[14:36:28] <scott_gonzalez> Since we use mkdir -p, it should work.
[14:36:40] <gseguin> that sounds like a good plan
[14:36:56] <gseguin> or maybe a private repo on jquery org
[14:36:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just give everyone commit access, so they can delete files/kill commits as often as they want.
[14:37:06] <gseguin> so you don't have to maintain 2 access lists
[14:37:09] <gseguin> whatever
[14:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that works too. Forgot we could do private.
[14:37:34] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't want to make a public test repo.
[14:37:44] <gseguin> yeah yeah that makes sense
[14:38:22] <gseguin> alright I'm outta here, I'll be back later tonight
[14:40:24] <scott_gonzalez> Ok. I should be back around 8:00p.
[14:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> ET
[14:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> A little over 2 hours from now.
[14:41:31] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! btw that doc is ok to review when you have time...
[14:41:57] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[14:42:16] <agcolom> thx :-)
[14:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> I might look at it tonight. Depends on whether I get the urge to write a GitHub OAuth module for Express.
[14:43:31] <agcolom> ah, well, I won't do anything until tomorrow, so no rush :-) but it's short, so shouldn't take you long
[17:06:18] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I replied to everything except the last one (the big one).
[17:06:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look into that later.
