[03:01:46] <maciuch> hello
[03:02:08] <maciuch> I'm having troubles publishing my jquery plugin
[03:02:22] <maciuch> I found info that I could find some help here
[03:03:09] <maciuch> is there anyone here who could help me find the reason why I can't publish it?
[03:12:54] <tuupola> does your json validate?
[03:13:46] <tuupola> did you setup the webhook?
[03:17:36] <maciuch> yes json is valid
[03:17:44] <maciuch> the web hook is also there
[03:18:08] <maciuch> and I created the tag
[03:18:26] <maciuch> just like in the instructions
[03:20:34] <maciuch> this is the url of my plugin https://github.com/mzubala/jquery-custom-scrollbar
[04:09:06] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> hi
[04:09:08] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> anyone online here?
[04:15:00] <danheberden> maciuch: your author section of your json isn't right
[04:15:36] <danheberden> it needs to be a people field - that is, an object that has at lease a name property, and an optional email or url property
[04:15:37] <danheberden> http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/package-manifest/#people-fields
[04:16:08] <danheberden> so author: { "name" : "Maciej Zubala" }
[04:16:39] <maciuch> ok I see 
[04:16:55] <maciuch> fixing it
[04:18:24] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> danheberden, how long time to publish a new plugin?
[04:18:37] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> *whats time
[04:19:03] <danheberden> JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo: are you asking when you submit your plugin, how long does it take to show up?
[04:19:32] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> danheberden, i create my file *.jquery.json and add a link hook
[04:19:45] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> but i dont have the plugin in site
[04:20:13] <danheberden> JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo: did you push since? you could hit the "test hook" button
[04:20:20] <danheberden> also, link to your plugin
[04:20:24] <danheberden> lemme see the json
[04:20:42] <danheberden> i still need to add my plugins to this thing
[04:20:59] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> danheberden, https://github.com/joubertredrat/shiftchecker/blob/master/shiftchecker.jquery.json
[04:22:47] <danheberden> JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo: it looks good to me - did you hit the "test hook" button?
[04:26:45] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> sorry, timeout :<
[04:27:02] <danheberden> JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo: i don't see that we have ever tried to get your plugin
[04:27:05] <danheberden> did you hit the 'test hook' button?
[04:27:18] <danheberden> if not, can you try it right now?
[04:27:21] <maciuch> danheberden: it works now! thx
[04:27:27] <danheberden> maciuch: yay!
[04:27:35] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> danheberden, i press button, but witout response
[04:27:52] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> the link is http://plugins.jquery.com/postreceive-hook, isnt?
[04:28:17] <danheberden> aye, JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo, it is
[04:28:37] <danheberden> well, it didn't throw any errors
[04:29:00] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> danheberden, the post request is name
[04:29:08] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> and the response is empty
[04:29:09] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> :<
[04:29:46] <danheberden> JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo: i'm not understanding what you're meaning
[04:30:05] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> danheberden, im using a firebug
[04:30:15] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> when i press the button 'test hook'
[04:30:45] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> in post go parameter 'name' empty and the response is empty
[04:31:35] <danheberden> JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo: yeah, it just lets github know to send the hook
[04:31:40] <danheberden> you don't actually see that process
[04:31:48] <danheberden> so don't expect any real, like, feedback
[04:31:54] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> understood :)
[04:32:00] <danheberden> hmm.. maybe i'm looking in the wrong place
[04:32:44] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> danheberden, thanks for help :D
[04:33:16] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> i test to publish this plugin because im devel other plugin and i interest to publish then :D
[04:40:01] <danheberden> JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo: can do you do me a favor? change your version to 1.2.0
[04:40:02] <danheberden> and tag 1.2.0
[04:40:34] <danheberden> basically, add the extra .0 to make it a full semver
[04:41:27] <JoBArTe_Skuld|Wo> danheberden, roger o>

[05:46:08] <ajpiano> umm jzaefferer
[05:46:12] <ajpiano> you just released jquery.com
[05:46:28] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: ^^
[05:46:36] <jzaefferer> uh?
[05:47:00] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: we merged jquery.com changes into master on friday
[05:47:09] <ajpiano> we were not going to tag until that was going to be ready release later today :/
[05:47:28] <jzaefferer> ah, crap
[05:47:30] <ajpiano> now there is a half-ready jquery.com
[05:47:45] <ajpiano> yeah....
[05:47:53] <ajpiano> i am in boston to go to a bocoup all hands thing
[05:47:58] <jzaefferer> well, pending a discussion how we can release jquery-wp-content in the future, how can we revert this?
[05:47:58] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[05:48:12] <scott_gonzalez> Re-tag the previous tag.
[05:48:27] <jzaefferer> checkout the tag, tag as new tag?
[05:48:31] <ajpiano> had just came in here to say that i would be around after that
[05:48:31] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[05:48:37] <ajpiano> oh good call scott_gonzalez
[05:48:52] <jzaefferer> doing that now
[05:49:11] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery-wp-content01] 15jzaefferer tagged 062.0.14 at 062.0.12: 02http://git.io/K5t8FQ
[05:49:18] <jzaefferer> okay, its back
[05:49:27] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: We should have sent out an email on Friday.
[05:50:05] <jzaefferer> we need to change this process so that I can push out minor updates like a QUnit release (content repo + footer in theme) without messing around like this
[05:50:25] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i suppose
[05:50:26] <jzaefferer> I'll just wait with the QUnit release announcement, another day or so
[05:51:05] <jzaefferer> btw. I guess since the more agressive caching, seeing updates from content repos coming live can now take a few minutes?
[05:51:22] <jzaefferer> been wondering why the home page on qunitjs.com didn't update, even though the deployment was succesful
[05:51:25] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: If you have a release announcement, it should've been coordinated with the 2 weeks of announcements.
[05:51:39] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: its just a tweet...
[05:51:48] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: normally it's fine, this was just a special case
[05:52:09] <jzaefferer> but I suppose it can be arranged - where do I get in line?
[05:53:18] <ajpiano> you can reply on the thread you replied to about keeping the docs site around, i suppose
[05:53:30] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: code school isn't going to be ready this week, so thursday is open
[05:53:52] <ajpiano> if you don't have a blog post it's less of a big deal, i think with the timing
[05:54:30] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: well, I could draft something, if that can go on blog.jquery.com
[05:54:52] <jzaefferer> would also mention the survey once more, and talk a bit about the testing roadmap
[05:54:58] <ajpiano> yeah, that's what i was thinking
[05:55:07] <ajpiano> you could talk about whateve's been going on in qunit
[05:55:16] <ajpiano> don't forget about turning purple
[05:55:17] <ajpiano> :)
[05:55:44] <jzaefferer> right
[05:55:53] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: we can do it either thursday or tomorrow, and push tomorrow off one more day
[05:56:04] <jzaefferer> well, at least the green lives on at http://api.jquerymobile.com/
[05:56:13] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: yeah
[05:56:17] <jzaefferer> Thursday is good
[05:56:47] <ajpiano> alright, sounds good to me, cc rworth
[05:57:07] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: I suppose the "No categories" on http://contribute.jquery.org/ is also due to old jquery-wp-content? (its still web-base-template to me...)
[05:57:24] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: the content has never been tagged
[05:57:31] <ajpiano> cause we're releasing it for the first time later today
[05:57:47] <ajpiano> so anyhow... that's why i popped in
[05:57:58] <ajpiano> to say that i'll be around after noon to deal with the releases :)
[05:58:06] <ajpiano> talk to you guys then... gotta run !
[05:58:48] <jzaefferer> alright
[07:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I've got a bunch of stuff to do around the house today, but I'm going to be working close to a full day, so if I'm not here whn you're ready to release, just call.
[07:11:42] <rworth> scott_gonzalez should we increase the delay from 20sec to 1min? Seems to still be hitting a lot of people
[07:16:58] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: are you there?
[07:17:37] <danheberden> can i remove the cache of a pulled plugin?
[07:17:44] <danheberden> i renamed it, but the old tags had the old name
[07:17:56] <danheberden> i have since removed the old tags, but it still is looking for them
[07:21:31] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: nvm, found the cache
[07:23:41] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: ugh, well, now it says there are no tags to process
[07:23:51] <danheberden> i don't want to have to rename this again when someone takes *that* name :/
[07:26:04] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: looks like it's the delay thing
[07:26:08] <danheberden> i had to go back and test-hook
[07:31:27] <scott_gonzalez> rworth danheberden: That will be fixed today.
[07:37:20] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: the pull has no tags at ALL
[07:37:22] <danheberden> which is weird
[07:37:28] <danheberden> because, well, there are old tags in the repo
[07:37:39] <danheberden> now it's not working even a minute or two after my original push
[07:41:27] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: so, if i run `git tag -l` in the folder, it shows them
[07:41:35] <danheberden> in .git/refs/tags/ there is nothing
[07:41:43] <danheberden> not sure if this helps you, but thought i'd share
[07:42:54] <danheberden> the weird thing is i see other plugins getting pulled and added to the db
[07:42:57] <danheberden> so i'm not sure what's worng
[07:42:58] <danheberden> *wrong
[07:51:14] <danheberden> ah, ok, so there is some other cache of what tags have been processed
[08:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> plugins.db stores which tags have been processed.

[08:42:22] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: I think I'm going to make "" valid, but not document it.
[08:42:27] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like a strange thing to accept.
[08:42:43] <scott_gonzalez> But node-semver does actually handle this, even though it can't expand the range.
[08:43:49] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: does my manifest file have to match my repo name?
[08:43:57] <scott_gonzalez> repo names don't matter.
[08:44:03] <danheberden> my repo name is easing.js, the manifest is easing.jquery.com and title is easing
[08:44:04] <scott_gonzalez> The file name has to match the plugin name.
[08:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, that's fine
[08:44:23] <danheberden> "plugin name" being teh title?
[08:44:25] <danheberden> oops
[08:44:26] <danheberden> sorry
[08:44:31] <danheberden> the "name" field in the json?
[08:44:34] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:44:48] <danheberden> this is why i ask: http://danheberden.com/share/d7bb5.png
[08:44:49] <scott_gonzalez> and easing.jquery.com being easing.jquery.json ;-)
[08:45:20] <scott_gonzalez> So, your manfiest file is .js, not .json.
[08:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> That's the problem.
[08:45:25] <danheberden> did i... i am a retard

[09:19:54] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You around
[10:05:41] <danheberden> hey scott_gonzalez, is there something i need to do wish sqlite3 locally to get the plugins site working?
[10:06:09] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/5cec.png
[10:06:18] <danheberden> *with sqlite3
[10:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> Can you clear your node_modules and gist the output of `npm install`?
[10:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...wait, there's an easier way to test what I'm thinking of.
[10:08:32] <scott_gonzalez> `node -e "require('sqlite3')"`
[10:08:40] <scott_gonzalez> Does that throw an error?
[10:09:34] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/ad26bfdc37f723f1ca30
[10:09:55] <danheberden> no errors, no scott_gonzalez
[10:10:11] <acc> when will the fix to "*" dependency range be deployed
[10:10:13] <acc> ?
[10:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Did you have a local setup before?
[10:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> Try `grunt clean-all setup`
[10:10:30] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: no - wanted to try to help with some issues
[10:10:36] <danheberden> so thought i'd get it up 'n running
[10:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> acc: Today.
[10:10:57] <acc> ok. i'll try submitting again tomorrow
[10:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> acc: Give me a sec, I'll deploy now just for you :-)

[10:21:24] <acc> https://github.com/accursoft/osk
[10:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..looks like you've deleted all your tags.
[10:25:19] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: or he never pushed with --tags ?
[10:26:30] <scott_gonzalez> He did, because we've processed previous versions.
[10:26:34] <danheberden> ah
[10:26:39] <danheberden> re: api.jquery.com http://danheberden.com/share/163f7.png

[10:26:56] <acc> i deleted the dead tags
[10:27:24] <acc> just pushed a new tag, not showing up yet ...

[10:27:56] <danheberden> in the services section
[10:28:14] <danheberden> on github.com
[10:29:32] <acc> still nothing ...

[10:30:15] <danheberden> acc added
[10:30:24] <danheberden> http://plugins.jquery.com/osk/
[10:30:47] <danheberden> it takes the site a bit to pull and process, fyi
[10:31:16] <danheberden> kswedberg: can you help me with the api site? ^
[10:32:13] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[10:32:24] <scott_gonzalez> osk was processed after the update.
[10:32:50] <acc> great, it's there now :-)
[10:33:06] <scott_gonzalez> Which means there was a full minute delay was in there.
[10:33:09] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: what do you mean?
[10:33:09] <scott_gonzalez> And it didn't find it?
[10:33:26] <scott_gonzalez> I deployed the 60 second delay right before he pushed the tag.

[10:35:28] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: i watched it
[10:35:46] <danheberden> 10:26:25 was when he first pushed after making the tag
[10:35:58] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[10:36:02] <scott_gonzalez> So a full minute isn't enough?
[10:36:05] <scott_gonzalez> How is that possible?
[10:36:08] <danheberden> hmm
[10:36:14] <danheberden> lets just see with the next one
[10:36:19] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:36:29] <scott_gonzalez> Seems insane for GitHub to be lagged that much with tags.
[10:43:27] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15RedWolves opened issue #229: Search field is not readable in IE 7&8  02http://git.io/bOanPA
[10:49:24] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: specially when it shows up on the web interface immediately
[10:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:53:43] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: any ideas on getting the plugin site running?
[10:54:10] <kswedberg> danheberden: sorry, was afk. waddayaneed?
[10:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Give me a minute and I'll help figure out what's going on with your local setup.
[11:00:47] <danheberden> kswedberg: was just trying to get the api site to work locally
[11:00:56] <danheberden> it built all the stuff, but doesn't show anything
[11:01:05] <kswedberg> ah. ok. did you do `grunt deploy` ? 
[11:01:05] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/163f7.png
[11:01:12] <kswedberg> looks like you just did `grunt`
[11:02:04] <kswedberg> and you have to mv config-sample.json config.json
[11:02:11] <danheberden> ah - should i update the readme kswedberg?
[11:02:13] <kswedberg> and modify it
[11:02:15] <danheberden> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com
[11:02:25] <danheberden> it just says to run `grunt` 
[11:02:39] <danheberden> grunt deploy worked perfect
[11:02:55] <kswedberg> awesome!
[11:03:22] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Ready to help debug the plugins site.
[11:03:35] <danheberden> kswedberg: i'll update the readme then
[11:03:39] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: yay!
[11:03:47] <kswedberg> well, you don't need grunt deploy unless you want to run the site locally. If you're just making minor changes, grunt is enough for linting, etc. 
[11:04:01] <danheberden> oh, gotcha
[11:04:10] <danheberden> well maybe a note on it would be nice, though?
[11:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> Skype for screen sharing?
[11:04:20] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: sure
[11:06:30] <kswedberg> danheberden: If you want to add a section after "Building" called "Deploying to a local server" or something, you could do that. 1. Follow instructions at jquery-wp-content. 2. Back in the api repo, run `grunt deploy` 
[11:20:59] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez, fyi, is awesome
[11:21:05] <danheberden> just if y'all were curious
[11:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> He speaks the truth :-)
[11:23:05] <kswedberg> danheberden: +9001

[11:26:54] <ajpiano> comfortable with it being the new jquery.com ?
[11:27:05] <ajpiano> though i need to add new stuff into the top menu
[11:27:09] * ajpiano checks
[11:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like the text in the banner is kind of hard to read.
[11:29:59] <ajpiano> we have to/should update Font Awesome
[11:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> And we should probably be linking to the migrate plugin in the download area.
[11:31:14] <scott_gonzalez> The browser support page looks pretty bad.
[11:31:37] <scott_gonzalez> Download jQuery isn't using the right page header style.

[11:42:55] <ajpiano> btw rworth scott_gonzalez i tried to warn you about using mailto:
[11:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> What happened?
[11:43:21] <rworth> there's been like 1 spam a day?
[11:43:22] <ajpiano> have you not noticed the spam coming to plugins@jquery.com
[11:43:26] <rworth> hardly
[11:43:28] <ajpiano> rworth: ... so far ;)
[11:43:38] <rworth> seems tolerable
[11:43:51] <ajpiano> let's just hope it stays that way
[11:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I have not. Gmail must be filtering it all.
[11:44:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, so far filtering with 100% accurracy.
[11:45:16] <ajpiano> weird, i have a bunch of things that got filtered
[11:45:43] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1o0M3w2g1J3Z
[11:45:48] <ajpiano> but some that haven't
[11:46:02] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: ajpiano: is this the room we want to direct people for problems adding plugins?
[11:46:04] <danheberden> or just #jquery ?
[11:46:24] <scott_gonzalez> We've been directing them here.
[11:46:34] <ajpiano> weird, the one from VRTUNISIA made it through to my @jquery.com
[11:46:36] <danheberden> I am adding more content to the readme
[11:46:37] <ajpiano> danheberden: here
[11:46:38] <danheberden> and was going to add it there
[11:46:40] <danheberden> is that fine?
[11:46:42] <scott_gonzalez> So, I've got 2 questions about these email notifications.
[11:46:50] <ajpiano> yep
[11:46:53] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: shoot
[11:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> 1) Who do we want to notify?
[11:47:02] <scott_gonzalez> Just the author?
[11:47:10] <scott_gonzalez> All maintainers?
[11:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> First person we find with an email address between all of them?
[11:47:25] <ajpiano> whoever did the push?
[11:47:35] <Mottie> scott_gonzalez: I think it should be whomever did the last push
[11:47:39] <ajpiano> or do we not know that
[11:47:49] <Mottie> you can get it from the api
[11:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> No API usage right now.
[11:48:12] <scott_gonzalez> If we're using the API, we're going to do comments.
[11:48:38] <Mottie> hmmm, what about the first maintainer, then the author if it doesn't exist
[11:48:41] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...actually, for some of these, we won't have a manifest to parse :-/
[11:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> I guess the quick solution isn't going to work for everything.
[11:49:35] <jqcommit> 01[13plugins.jquery.com01] 15danheberden pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/PAuTxg
[11:49:35] <jqcommit> 13plugins.jquery.com/06master 14c4d62d0 15Dan Heberden: Improve documentation for adding plugins as well as developing for the plugins site itself
[11:49:49] <Mottie> you could always add another field to the manifest for contact
[11:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> We're not adding more fields.
[11:50:00] <Mottie> ok
[11:50:07] <scott_gonzalez> Certainly not to duplicate data that already exists.
[11:50:12] <rworth> to start, can we just create a public log?
[11:50:14] <ajpiano> plus, if the manifest is invalid json, it won't parse, no matter how many fields we add
[11:50:19] <scott_gonzalez> It also wouldn't solve the problem of a broken manifest.
[11:50:26] <ajpiano> there we go again scott_gonzalez :)
[11:50:28] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: THERE WE GO AGAIN
[11:50:29] <scott_gonzalez> OMG
[11:50:30] <ajpiano> OH MAN
[11:50:35] <Mottie> LOL
[11:50:36] <ajpiano> wow
[11:50:56] <danheberden> it's like ajpiano and i are supposed to be working on this problem
[11:50:57] <danheberden> RIGHT NOW
[11:51:07] <danheberden> if only he were close by
[11:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Sure, where can we put it for now?
[11:51:10] <danheberden> and i could work with him on it
[11:51:15] <ajpiano> haha danheberden
[11:51:21] <rworth> plugins.jquery.com/log ?
[11:51:35] <ajpiano> local manifest validation in a grunt task will definitely help with some of these things
[11:51:38] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: With an nginx proxy?
[11:51:56] <rworth> or publish it to WP?
[11:52:12] <scott_gonzalez> You want us to publish to WordPress on every failure?
[11:52:18] <rworth> or not
[11:52:34] <rworth> a proxy works
[11:52:40] <rworth> isn't that how we do irc logs?
[11:52:44] <Mottie> I hate to interupt this process, but I can't seem to get my plugin(s) to register, this is one of them: https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/AnythingZoomer
[11:53:56] <scott_gonzalez> mManifest errors: github/CSS-Tricks/AnythingZoomer v2.2.1 anythingzoomer.jquery.json [ 'Name must match manifest file name.' ]
[11:54:11] <scott_gonzalez> capitalization
[11:54:12] <Mottie> so caps matter?
[11:54:14] <Mottie> ok
[11:54:15] <Mottie> thanks
[11:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> Mottie: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/73
[11:54:44] <rworth> Mottie don't forget to bump version number in manifest and tag with new version after correcting
[11:54:51] <Mottie> ok
[11:54:56] <Mottie> thanks
[11:55:37] <scott_gonzalez> So, we can at least get the email notifications working for people with valid JSON.
[11:55:48] <scott_gonzalez> If they have an email address listed for any maintainer or the author.
[11:55:51] <scott_gonzalez> That's a start.
[11:56:05] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can do the big change where we can use the GitHub API.
[11:56:08] <scott_gonzalez> Does that seem reasonable?
[11:56:16] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: can simple-log write to a separate file, alternatively?
[11:56:35] <scott_gonzalez> No, it's either all syslog or all console.
[11:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> We can probably have syslog output tee to another file with a filter.
[11:57:51] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: I can also easily add in additional logging to another file.
[11:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> But I think we have a long term solution which is to use the GitHub API.
[11:58:26] <danheberden> we do
[11:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> I assume Bitbucket has similar APIs?
[11:58:37] <danheberden> i just think rworth's idea of having this on a page
[11:58:39] <danheberden> is easy
[11:59:02] <danheberden> for now, at least we can say "check /log to see the status of processing operations"
[11:59:04] <ajpiano> it's definitely slightly better than what we have now
[11:59:39] <scott_gonzalez> Is it possible to have Splunk generate the log?
[12:02:02] <Mottie> scott_gonzalez: sorry to bother you again.. still no go: https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/AnythingZoomer
[12:02:29] <Mottie> the tags didn't match, so I removed the "v" prefix in the last version
[12:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> Try pressing the test hook button.
[12:03:28] <Mottie> nothing happens... and I'm using http://plugins.jquery.com/postreceive-hook
[12:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> It sent the test.
[12:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> Wait a minute for it to process.
[12:03:51] <Mottie> oh ok
[12:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> it worked
[12:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> http://plugins.jquery.com/anythingzoomer/
[12:04:53] <scott_gonzalez> Who do we know at GitHub?
[12:05:01] <scott_gonzalez> We need to bitch them out about this delay.
[12:05:04] <Mottie> great thanks!
[12:05:18] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: the weird thing is it shows up with git tag -l
[12:05:23] <danheberden> how is that even possible
[12:05:30] <danheberden> when there are no refs
[12:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea.
[12:05:42] <danheberden> are we not merging the remote properly
[12:05:43] <danheberden> ?
[12:06:13] <scott_gonzalez> return exec( "git fetch -t", { cwd: repo.path }, this );
[12:06:45] <danheberden> are we using the contents of refs/tags or tag list -l?
[12:07:11] <scott_gonzalez> exec( "git ls-tree " + tag + " --name-only", { cwd: this.path }
[12:07:21] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's after we find the tag.
[12:07:31] <scott_gonzalez> We're using `git tag`
[12:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Does `git tag` not show it, but `git tag -l` does?
[12:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like those two should be equivalent.
[12:08:54] <scott_gonzalez> Or are you just saying that the ref doesn't exist, so it doesn't make sense for `git tag` to list it.
[12:09:15] <danheberden> oh, i donno - i just have always done -l for some reason
[12:09:19] <danheberden> same thing though
[12:09:27] <danheberden> since -l takes a pattern if you want
[12:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so the problem is that even `git tag` isn't finding it.
[12:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> right
[12:09:36] <danheberden> oh weird
[12:09:43] <danheberden> i must have had a different problem when i was seeing it
[12:16:00] <rworth> scott_gonzalez https://twitter.com/mojombo/status/292311164052992000
[12:16:01] <b-ot> rworth, @mojombo: Both GitHub and Semantic Versioning are integral to the new jQuery Plugin Registry. Pretty happy right now. http://t.co/GCipqACF
[12:16:44] <scott_gonzalez> Going right for the big guns, huh?
[12:17:03] <rworth> I re-tweeted that the other day, so I'd remember in case we needed a contact :)
[12:17:12] <rworth> seems primed
[12:20:24] <ajpiano> i imagine he'll be pretty chuffed about the part where it turns out github and semantric versioning are integral to all of our websites
[12:27:38] <scott_gonzalez> splunk can spit out this report: https://gist.github.com/4589003
[12:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> I assume we can get it to do that through a cron.
[12:28:05] <scott_gonzalez> And then just filter that down to the actual message instead of all the other data.
[12:28:32] <scott_gonzalez> We'd want to create a search that finds the other errors cases too, but that's easy.
[12:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> I don't really know much about splunk, there's probably a better way to accomplish that.
[12:30:05] <scott_gonzalez> Or we can just create a log file.

[12:30:17] <scott_gonzalez> In the places where I was going to send an email.
[12:38:22] <richardscarrott> Hi there, I've been having difficulty getting my plugins up on the plugin registry for a while now and I'm at a loss, I wonder if anybody would be able to help
[12:38:48] <richardscarrott> I'm pretty certain I've got the naming of the manifest correct, the version number is valid and the tag name matches
[12:39:45] <richardscarrott> One of the plugins in question is https://github.com/richardscarrott/jquery-ui-carousel
[12:40:48] <richardscarrott> and I think the service hook is correctly setup
[12:41:36] <ajpiano> richardscarrott: can you "test hook"
[12:41:52] <ajpiano> tailing the last 10000 entires in th logs, i don't see anything form your plugins
[12:41:57] <rworth> don't think that's it in this case
[12:42:03] <rworth> I went back to yesterday's log and found
[12:42:04] <rworth> Jan 20 12:49:08 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[26607]: No manifest files for github/richardscarrott/jquery-ui-carousel v0.8.6
[12:42:04] <rworth> Jan 20 12:49:09 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[26607]: No valid releases for github/richardscarrott/jquery-ui-carousel
[12:42:17] <rworth> which is odd because I see the manifest in the tag
[12:42:21] <rworth> scott_gonzalez any ideas?
[12:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> richardscarrott: Did you retag that version?
[12:43:35] <scott_gonzalez> Or has the manifest always been in that tag?
[12:43:44] <Mottie> there is a "v" in the tag
[12:44:04] <Mottie> but not in the manifest... I did that too!
[12:44:17] <scott_gonzalez> Mottie: That's correct.
[12:44:26] <scott_gonzalez> v is allowed in the tag.
[12:44:55] <Mottie> but it doesn't match
[12:45:01] <richardscarrott> the tag did already exist but I so, now this could be the issue, I deleted it and re-added another one with the same name (as I didn't want to bump the version)
[12:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> Mottie: They're both 0.8.6
[12:45:23] <scott_gonzalez> richardscarrott: It won't re-process the same tag name.
[12:45:44] <Mottie> not when I click on the [ branch: master ] button and click the "tags" tab
[12:46:04] <scott_gonzalez> Tag: v0.8.6, manifest version: 0.8.6.
[12:46:06] <scott_gonzalez> That's valid.
[12:46:16] <Mottie> ok
[12:46:43] <richardscarrott> right that'll be the issue then, so every time I update the manifest I need to re-tag to a new version?
[12:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> The site only looks at tags.
[12:47:11] <scott_gonzalez> And it'll only look at a tag once.
[12:48:00] <richardscarrott> kk, thanks for that info, I'll create a new tag
[12:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> If you don't want to bump the version, you can tag without the v prefix.
[12:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's like a built-in one shot do-over :-P
[12:50:19] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: http://danheberden.com/share/5b65.png
[12:50:31] <richardscarrott> Not sure my OCD will be able to cope with that but handy nonetheless
[12:52:25] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Do you think you could get that into a file that we can proxy?
[12:53:19] <danheberden> i have no idea :/
[12:53:19] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, me neither.
[12:53:21] <scott_gonzalez> Should I just add logging into the scripts for now?
[12:53:34] <danheberden> i feel like it might be WAY easier
[12:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:53:58] <danheberden> that way we can easily say what kind of messages get logged
[12:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> yeha
[12:55:12] <danheberden> yeeee haw
[12:55:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to do: missing manfiest, invalid JSON, manfiest validation errors
[12:56:50] <danheberden> wonderful

[12:57:18] <danheberden> i honestly think that will be enough, ya know? it doesn't matter if the errors are public
[12:58:17] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: if you want, just make the log portion and i'll make the public facing portion
[12:59:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I'll get this in with a config setting for where the error log lives.
[12:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> And you can get the nginx proxy working.
[13:00:47] <danheberden> would it be smarter to have log entries shoved into sqlite?
[13:01:16] <danheberden> meh, i'm overthinking what we could do
[13:01:25] <danheberden> was thinking of auto-update and querying just latest entries
[13:01:46] <danheberden> but updating wp with that page every 30 seconds or something seems better
[13:02:54] <scott_gonzalez> If we just log to a file and proxy through nginx, it'll be live.
[13:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, of course the file will get pretty big.
[13:03:47] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let's start with this and we can refine as necessary.
[13:04:02] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully we'll get GitHub notifications in place before the size becomes an issue.
[13:09:17] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/0u3J1V0Q3e2e
[13:10:24] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: you mean don't have any styling?
[13:10:54] <danheberden> or should we just have a page that is styled request the contents of the log via ajax?
[13:10:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[13:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> I think just raw text.
[13:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> Long term this page won't even exist, right?
[13:11:32] <danheberden> i mean, we've gone through this much work to make our sites look good
[13:11:41] <danheberden> heh, scott_gonzalez, i bet this is around for a long time
[13:11:46] <danheberden> not to be a negative nancy
[13:11:51] <danheberden> but, also, i think it is enough
[13:11:52] <danheberden> ya know?
[13:12:15] <danheberden> i'll play around with the proxy and if we can make it look sexier
[13:12:23] <danheberden> so either way, we can have it up now
[13:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, we can also iterate on it.
[13:12:55] <danheberden> and then pivot
[13:13:00] <danheberden> and touch base after that
[13:14:23] <ajpiano> the good news is at least we will be able to dogfood it

[13:15:09] <jqcommit> 13plugins.jquery.com/06master 1404a131e 15Scott GonzÃ¡lez: Create an error log of user errors. First step at providing public feedback.
[13:15:47] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: The error log will be in {plugins.jquery.com checkout}/error.log
[13:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> But you can change the path in config.json with the errorLog key.
[13:16:11] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: awesome
[13:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> If you want it somewhere else, we should probably update the key now, before I deploy.
[13:16:46] <danheberden> a checkout shouldn't obliterate it, so i think that's fine
[13:16:50] <danheberden> or even if it did, that's totally cool
[13:17:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, a checkout won't kill it, not sure if puppet manages the config file though.
[13:17:28] <danheberden> although
[13:17:31] <danheberden> if it's just a file
[13:17:54] <danheberden> we could just put it in {plugins.jquery.com checkout}/web/log.txt
[13:17:59] <danheberden> or error.log
[13:18:00] <danheberden> or whatever
[13:18:17] <danheberden> and then the proxy should happen as a static file
[13:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> You can put it wherever you want :-) The default is just error.log
[13:18:23] <danheberden> ok
[13:18:44] <danheberden> you'll have to help me on how to restart manager
[13:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> It'll restart when I deploy.
[13:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> puppet sends a SIGHUP to the manager on deploy.
[13:19:40] <danheberden> oh ok
[13:19:41] <scott_gonzalez> Which restarts all the child processes.
[13:20:11] <scott_gonzalez> So just let me know when you've got the config updated to what you want.
[13:20:16] <scott_gonzalez> And then I'll tag.
[13:20:40] <danheberden> ok
[13:21:37] <danheberden> well, since this is on jq02, it won't matter where - so lets just stick with what you did. 
[13:21:42] <danheberden> that location is great

[13:29:46] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Looks much better.
[13:30:06] <ajpiano> yeah... as it turns out, it makes sense to markup tabular data in tables
[13:30:29] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:30:29] <ajpiano> rather than ul li with the grid system and then display: table-cell on nested divs inside of the lis
[13:30:37] <ajpiano> CRAZY SHITE
[13:32:31] <Mottie> is that log live now?
[13:32:54] <danheberden> gnarf: if you are around and can handle the proxy of the log that scott created on jq02 to jq01 in the next 4 hours or so, i won't be able to do it until then
[13:33:26] <danheberden> since ajpiano and i just realized we've just been doing jq stuff instead of the work we were supposed to have done by 6:30
[13:35:36] <Mottie> Sorry again... could I get some help as to why this plugin isn't registering now? https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/AnythingSlider
[13:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> Mottie: Capitalization again?
[13:37:23] <Mottie> nope
[13:37:53] <scott_gonzalez> v1.8.11?
[13:37:59] <Mottie> 1.8.14
[13:38:02] <Mottie> I removed the v
[13:38:48] <Mottie> odd.. it's not showing up in the Tags link, but it is in the [ branch: master ] button
[13:40:27] <scott_gonzalez> Try pressing the test hook
[13:40:39] <Mottie> ok
[13:40:41] <danheberden> i dn't see a 1.8.14 tag
[13:40:46] <danheberden> https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/AnythingSlider/tags
[13:40:48] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: It's at the bottom.
[13:41:01] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, weird
[13:41:06] <danheberden> huh?
[13:41:14] <scott_gonzalez> It shows up in the branch/tag selector.
[13:41:57] <Mottie> https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/AnythingSlider/tree/1.8.14
[13:42:36] <Mottie> I'll submit an issue to github too
[13:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> This is crazy.
[13:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> The tags page and the tag selector both show 103 items.
[13:43:14] <scott_gonzalez> But they clearly aren't showing the same 103.
[13:43:24] <Mottie> wierd huh? LOL
[13:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> It didn't find anything when it processed that test hook.
[13:44:17] <Mottie> should I click it again?
[13:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...It didn't even clone the repo.
[13:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> This is the first repo where we have no useful info :-/
[13:47:26] <Mottie> =(
[13:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> Give me a minute to walk through the code and see if I can figure out what might've happened.
[13:47:55] <Mottie> should I try with the tag set to v1.8.14?
[13:48:02] <Mottie> ok
[13:48:31] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it should clone the repo on any update.
[13:48:51] <scott_gonzalez> And it's received plenty of hooks for AnythingSlider.
[13:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> Yet the repo hasn't been cloned.
[13:53:41] <scott_gonzalez> umm...what is this?
[13:53:42] <scott_gonzalez> Error: Command failed: fatal: remote error: access denied or repository not exported: /2/nw/26/21/de/280676/792115.git
[13:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> git clone git://github.com/CSS-Tricks/AnythingSlider.git
[13:54:38] <scott_gonzalez> ^ that throws an error for me.
[13:54:58] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps related to the weird tags issue.
[13:55:19] <scott_gonzalez> Mottie: I feel like we're providing a horrible experience for you right now :-(
[13:55:33] <Mottie> well we do have a history of completely deleting the repo and rebuilding it twice before github restored it
[13:55:46] <Mottie> someone else did that LOL
[13:55:50] <Mottie> no worries
[13:56:05] <Mottie> we got AnythingZoomer working
[13:56:28] <Mottie> and I see plenty of logs of other people cloning the AnythingSlider repo
[13:56:34] <Mottie> so I don't know
[13:57:16] <scott_gonzalez> Try creating a fresh clone with that command I just pasted.
[13:57:20] <scott_gonzalez> See if it works for you.
[13:58:44] <Mottie> ot
[13:58:55] <Mottie> the remote end hung up unexpectedly
[13:59:17] <Mottie> oh LOL and no address associated with name
[13:59:32] <Mottie> it must be a github thing
[13:59:35] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> Quick, everyone migrate to Bitbucket.
[14:00:02] <Mottie> ok I'll report that issue 
[14:00:03] <Mottie> LMAO
[14:00:06] <Mottie> thanks again!
[14:00:16] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[14:08:53] <richardscarrott> hi there, I've added a new tag omitting the 'v' (just so I don't have to bump the version number up), are you able to tell if the service hook has made it to you?
[14:09:47] <richardscarrott> there were three repos - https://github.com/richardscarrott/jquery-ui-carousel, https://github.com/richardscarrott/jquery-modal and https://github.com/richardscarrott/jquery-mousestop-event
[15:24:25] <Mottie> scott_gonzalez: well it looks like github has fixed the repo already, I am able to clone it now! :P https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/AnythingSlider 
[15:25:05] <Mottie> I just used the test hook but it doesn't seem to be updating. Should I push another update?
[15:42:37] <rworth> Mottie Manifest errors: github/CSS-Tricks/AnythingSlider v1.8.11 anythingslider.jquery.json [ 'Name must match manifest file name.',   'Manifest version (v1.8.11) is invalid.' ]
[15:42:58] <rworth> your filename is lowercase but the name in the manifest is camel-case
[15:43:17] <rworth> and the version in the manifest cannot contain a v (though the tag can)
[15:45:41] <Mottie> odd.. this is the latest manifest file: https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/AnythingSlider/blob/master/anythingslider.jquery.json
[15:45:47] <Mottie> version 1.8.14
[15:46:51] <Mottie> I'll try pushing a new version with a "v" in front
[15:47:45] <rworth> sorry, I was only looking at the tags with the v in front
[15:47:53] <Mottie> ahh
[15:48:03] <Mottie> I changed it because I thought they had to exactly match
[15:48:10] <rworth> nope
[15:48:15] <Mottie> I know that now :)
[15:48:31] <rworth> :)
[15:48:38] <rworth> ok, try the 'test hook' button now
[15:48:55] <Mottie> ok
[15:50:35] <richardscarrott> Hi rworth: if you get some time I don't suppose you'd be able to take a look into my manifest as I'm now confident I've got my naming conventions correct so I'm guessing it's now down to my post hook not working? https://github.com/richardscarrott/jquery-ui-carousel
[15:51:07] <rworth> Mottie I'm at a loss. The request came through, and it tried to process some old tags that don't have a manifest, but no mention of 1.8.14
[15:51:24] <rworth> richardscarrott afk for 1-2hrs, hopefully after that
[15:51:25] <Mottie> ok I'll push another version with the "v" in front
[15:51:31] <Mottie> thanks again!
[15:52:08] <danheberden> there is only 0.8.6 as the latest tag
[15:52:10] <danheberden> pulled currently
[15:52:26] <danheberden> oh, different folks - oops
[15:53:00] <danheberden> 1.8.14 is present in the pull Mottie
[15:53:30] <Mottie> yeah
[15:53:38] <Mottie> the repo was all messed up
[15:54:04] <Mottie> it was deleted, remade, deleted the overwritten when we moved it over
[15:54:10] <Mottie> then
[15:54:13] <Mottie> not the
[15:55:05] <danheberden> richardscarrott: can you hit the 'test hook' button in the web-hook services part of github?
[15:57:49] <richardscarrott> danheberden: Yeah just clicked it now
[15:58:46] <danheberden> richardscarrott: no tags to process - it says the last tag was yesterday
[15:59:36] <richardscarrott> that's weird, I made 0.8.6 only a couple of hours ago
[16:00:29] <richardscarrott> (I did previously have v0.8.6 but I deleted that and added 0.8.6 to prompt the service hook)
[16:01:12] <danheberden> richardscarrott: it's not adding it because it's already there :/
[16:01:12] <danheberden> http://plugins.jquery.com/rs.carousel/
[16:01:23] <Mottie> Scott said earlier to not delete/replace an old tag
[16:02:27] <richardscarrott> danheberden: magic :)
[16:03:08] <richardscarrott> Not quite sure how I missed that but thanks
[16:09:21] <Mottie> ok I'm pushed a new tag... can someone check for me please *puppy dog eyes* https://github.com/CSS-Tricks/AnythingSlider
[16:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> Mottie: Press the test hook button.
[16:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> I have the processing throttled to 10 tags per hook.
[16:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> And you've got a lot of tags.
[16:10:45] <Mottie> done
[16:10:51] <Mottie> LOL I know
[16:11:10] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You around?
[16:11:12] <Mottie> I tag too much... it's an addiction
[16:11:22] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Any chance you're done with Bocoup stuff and can work on that proxy?
[16:11:30] <scott_gonzalez> Mottie: It's a good addiction :-)
[16:11:34] <Mottie> hehe
[16:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> Now if only we didn't have this damn 1 minute delay on all processing...
[16:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> BAM!
[16:11:54] <richardscarrott> Mottie: Scott did mention earlier there's no harm in creating a new tag with the same number but omitting the 'v' as it's still a completely new tag name so the registry will pick up on it.
[16:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> Added anythingslider v1.8.15 to plugins DB
[16:12:11] <Mottie> YAY!!!!
[16:12:13] <Mottie> whew
[16:12:21] <Mottie> thanks so much!
[16:12:28] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[16:12:41] <scott_gonzalez> richardscarrott: Let me look into what's going on with yours.
[16:12:57] <Mottie> yeah richard, that was part of the issue I think... I switched from using v's to not using them.. now I'm back to adding them
[16:13:08] <richardscarrott> Don't worry Scott, it's working now!
[16:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> oh, good :-)
[16:13:58] <richardscarrott> scott_gonzalez: thanks for the help
[16:14:04] <scott_gonzalez> richardscarrott: no problem
[16:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> The good news is that all of the user errors are getting logged to a file now.
[16:15:00] <scott_gonzalez> So once someone from infrastructure can setup the proxy, people will be able to see if there were errors.
[16:18:40] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: kswedberg i don't understand why mike chose to register his plugin as cycle2
[16:19:02] <kswedberg> ajpiano: he has two of them. 
[16:19:09] <kswedberg> cycle2 is next-gen
[16:19:15] <ajpiano> yeah
[16:19:23] <ajpiano> but he registered cycle2 4 days ago
[16:19:25] <kswedberg> maybe he wants to retire the first one or soemthing
[16:19:29] <ajpiano> and cycle was *not* taken
[16:19:32] <ajpiano> at that time
[16:19:35] <ajpiano> so it seems intentional
[16:19:37] <kswedberg> well, at least he knew what he was doing
[16:19:40] <kswedberg> yeah
[16:20:00] <ajpiano> though i'm not crazy about people putting "version" numbers in plugin names
[16:20:19] <ajpiano> maybe we need to add a "paradigm" metadata to jquery.json
[16:20:20] <ajpiano> :p
[16:21:21] <kswedberg> yeah. I'm going to register bbq2
[16:21:36] <kswedberg> oh. wait.
[16:23:09] <kswedberg> twitter's flaking out on me. :/
[16:26:13] <kswedberg> .tweet @malsup
[16:26:33] <kswedberg> nothing works for me anymore. 
[16:26:34] <ajpiano> kswedberg: i saw it
[16:28:51] <Mottie> Thank you all for your assistance! I'm calling it a night! :)
[16:30:43] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano â¦after we talked today I am working on getting set up again to help out with jquerymobile.com.  I've ran through all the instructions and have a 404 home page for jQuery mobile at local.jquerymobile.com.  The wp database doesn't seem to have any data for the site.  am I missing a step somewhere?
[16:30:57] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: fwiw I agree about cycle deserving name protection. 
[16:31:36] <kswedberg> RWhitbeck: did you run grunt deploy from jquerymobile after setting up the config.json?
[16:31:50] <RWhitbeck> just grunt
[16:31:54] <kswedberg> do grunt deploy
[16:31:59] <RWhitbeck> ok
[16:32:39] <RWhitbeck> cool thanks the readme needs an updating â¦ I'll do that
[16:32:47] <ajpiano> kswedberg: scott_gonzalez i agree that we should get in touch with Ry at this point
[16:32:52] <ajpiano> his first commit was 7 days ago
[16:33:08] <kswedberg> whoa. yeah, that's not cool.
[16:33:30] <kswedberg> ajpiano, scott_gonzalez : what about this one? http://plugins.jquery.com/validate/
[16:34:08] <ajpiano> kswedberg: jorn's plugin isn't called Validate, it's called Validation
[16:34:09] <ajpiano> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation

[16:34:29] <kswedberg> ah. ok. good enough then.
[16:35:25] <RWhitbeck> ooh each commit will be scrutinized in here I see ;-)
[16:35:40] <kswedberg> RWhitbeck: I don't think that's commit was a good one. :p
[16:35:58] <kswedberg> *that commit
[16:36:30] <RWhitbeck> by the way the instructions for setting up the environment have come a long way since the dev summit.  I had to reset up the environment due to the jquery-base-template repo change. 
[16:36:54] <RWhitbeck> Went smooth compared to last time. 
[16:37:09] <kswedberg> grunt deploy isn't needed to lint the files and make sure all is in working order before committing. for that you only need to do `grunt`. 
[16:37:09] <RWhitbeck> thanks kswedberg
[16:37:21] <ajpiano> RWhitbeck: that's reassuring :D
[17:07:07] <jqcommit> 01[13jquerymobile.com01] 15RedWolves pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/_38Mug
[17:07:07] <jqcommit> 13jquerymobile.com/06master 14ffade5a 15Ralph Whitbeck: reverted previous commit per @kswedberg's feedback
[17:11:43] <rworth> kswedberg that's true for the api site, but not as much applicable to a pages-only content site like jquerymobile.com
[17:12:04] <rworth> because the only verification for pages is to deploy them locally and see them rendered
[17:14:11] <kswedberg> rworth: ok. good to know. not sure what you mean by "that"
[17:14:24] <kswedberg> , though
[17:15:23] <rworth> "grunt deploy isn't needed to lint the files and make sure all is in working order before committing"
[17:15:33] <kswedberg> gotcha
[17:16:06] <kswedberg> in terms of RWhitbeck's commit, I still don't think it's enough to just change `grunt` to `grunt deploy`. because it will break if jquery-wp-content isn't set up
[17:17:17] <RWhitbeck> my assumption is that jquery-wp-content is required to contribute but it seems like that's not the case. 
[17:17:33] <rworth> I didn't actually look at his commit, to be clear. I just wanted to clarify that 'grunt' alone is not sufficient a check for an html page like it is for an xml file
[17:17:42] <rworth> RWhitbeck depends on the level
[17:18:06] <kswedberg> rworth: why not? If you're just fixing a misspelled word?
[17:18:10] <rworth> minor edits can be made without wp-content
[17:18:16] <rworth> kswedberg yeah
[17:18:28] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Theoretically, `grunt` will catch things like missing metadata or broken mardown.
[17:18:57] <scott_gonzalez> ...and I need to step away AGAIN...
[17:37:51] <RWhitbeck> Just updated the learn repo locallyâ¦wow looks different then it did at the dev summit.  Has that been released yet?
[17:41:18] <kswedberg> one way to find out! http://learn.jquery.com/ :)
[17:42:30] <kswedberg> now in double beta!!
[17:43:00] <kswedberg> RWhitbeck: it hasn't been announced yet.
[17:43:11] <kswedberg> as far as I know
[17:43:38] <RWhitbeck> yeah that version looks different then the local version as well. 
[17:44:41] <kswedberg> RWhitbeck: does stage.learn.jquery.com look the same as your local?
[17:44:59] <RWhitbeck> yeah
[17:45:34] <kswedberg> cool
[17:46:29] <kswedberg> if it works the same way as api.jquery.com, the production site only gets updated when the repo is tagged.
[17:54:15] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts on this layout for version/date? http://cl.ly/image/103O1h0w3T3o
[17:58:01] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, it has not yet been officially released.
[18:04:38] <jqcommit> [13learn.jquery.com] 15RedWolves opened pull request #218: Updated content of contributing page to point to the new jquery-wp-conte... (06master...06issue-217)  02http://git.io/M7lHVA
[18:30:21] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: was that log just on the staging server?
[18:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> No, it's on the production server too.
[18:48:42] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: when we're done processing the plugin, could we just sync that as a pge?
[18:48:44] <danheberden> *page
[18:49:04] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a lot of syncing.
[18:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> We'd also need to use a new post type.
[18:50:13] <danheberden> oh, right
[18:50:22] <danheberden> ok i'll keep trying to figure out how the hell to proxy between these boxes
[18:50:23] <danheberden> lol
[18:50:47] <scott_gonzalez> You should be able to look at how the post-receive hook is proxied.
[18:52:37] <danheberden> that's the other direction though
[18:52:38] <danheberden> but yeah
[18:52:49] <danheberden> i don't think it give github anything
[18:52:51] <scott_gonzalez> No it's not.
[18:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> It's the same direction, proxying from the web server to the workhorse server.
[18:54:13] <scott_gonzalez> The log file is on the same machine as the update server.

[19:19:24] <jqcommit> 13jquery-wp-content/06master 142d660ca 15Scott GonzÃ¡lez: New index page for api.jqueryui.com/*
[19:21:36] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I just tried to disable the static index page for api.jqueryui.com/* and it didn't seem to work on stage: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/2d660ca6a243c31e9f7b16bef079ce7d5cd78c71
[19:21:37] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, Scott GonzÃ¡lez (8m 34s ago): New index page for api.jqueryui.com/*
[19:22:10] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: You can tell if it's working because there will be another header in the middle of the page and then a bunch of links at the bottom.
[19:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> Interestingly, it works for me locally with 1.8, but not with 1.9.
[19:22:47] <scott_gonzalez> I figured I'd push to stage and see if it worked in both places there.
[22:43:39] <Guest68257> hi, I push the new plugin SlideShow https://github.com/appleboy/jquery.slideShow ,but can't display on http://plugins.jquery.com/ site
[22:45:46] <appleboy_> so I don't know what's wrong with github.
[22:49:11] <danheberden> appleboy_: your json is invalid
[22:49:31] <danheberden> try it in jsonlint.com
[22:50:24] <appleboy_> ok, wait
[22:51:22] <appleboy_> https://raw.github.com/appleboy/jquery.slideShow/master/slideshow.jquery.json is Valid JSON
[22:51:41] <danheberden> interesting
[22:51:49] <danheberden> i wonder why the plugins site doesn't like it
[22:52:00] <danheberden> oh, it says 1.0.7 isn't valid
[22:52:12] <appleboy_> oh
[22:52:23] <danheberden> https://github.com/appleboy/jquery.slideShow/blob/1.0.7/slideshow.jquery.json
[22:52:37] <danheberden> ah yeah, missing the comma on 24.. hmm, so why didn't 1.0.8 process
[22:52:41] <appleboy_> OK
[22:52:59] <appleboy_> I try to delete it.
[22:53:12] <danheberden> appleboy_: delete it?
[22:53:17] <danheberden> nah, it's already been processed
[22:53:30] <danheberden> but you're trying to use a name that's already been taken http://plugins.jquery.com/slideShow/
[22:53:35] <danheberden> so when it does go to process
[22:53:38] <danheberden> it will be rejected
[22:53:39] <appleboy_> delete the 1.0.7 tag?
[22:54:18] <appleboy_> ok
[22:54:46] <danheberden> appleboy_: no, don't delete tags
[22:54:52] <danheberden> it doesn't do anything
[22:54:58] <danheberden> the system already tried to process it
[22:55:08] <danheberden> a) rename your plugin to something available on the plugins site
[22:55:21] <danheberden> (the name attribute in the pluginname.jquery.json)
[22:55:48] <danheberden> b) rename slideshow.jquery.json to reflect that new name
[22:55:57] <danheberden> c) commit those changes and make a new tag
[22:56:10] <appleboy_> OK
[22:56:19] <appleboy_> I try it again.
[22:56:33] <danheberden> Processing github/appleboy/jquery.slideShow [ '1.0.8' ]
[22:56:33] <danheberden> Found manifest files for github/appleboy/jquery.slideShow 1.0.8 [ 'slideshow.jquery.json' ]
[22:56:33] <danheberden> github/appleboy attempted to add slideshow which is owned by github/i-like-robots
[22:56:36] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: the error.log log isnt' getting the notifications like this 
[22:56:46] <danheberden> ^ ugh, paste fail - thnx limechat
[23:04:47] <appleboy_> Hi
