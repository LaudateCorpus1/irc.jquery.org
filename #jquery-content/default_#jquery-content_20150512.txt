[06:56:25] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom kborchers: Since I *still* don't understand the scope of the content team, should they have push access to brand.jquery.org?
[06:57:21] <agcolom> last time we talked about brand.jquery.org, it fell under Kris. 
[06:57:41] <agcolom> (according to the doc we produced last xmas.)
[06:57:43] <scott_gonzalez> Then perhaps he should actually maintain it?
[06:57:56] <agcolom> That's my understanding
[06:57:58] <scott_gonzalez> This sat for three weeks until I merged it: https://github.com/jquery/brand.jquery.org/pull/19
[06:58:17] <scott_gonzalez> And I only did it because arthurvr asked.
[06:58:49] <agcolom> yes thanks :-) 
[06:59:20] <agcolom> kborchers: I think brand.jquery.org is under you, right?
[07:00:04] <kborchers> yes
[08:19:30] <arthurvr> agcolom: scott_gonzalez: kborchers: Thanks for taking care of that one by the way, Scott! I pesonally think scott_gonzalez is right about the not so clear scope of the content team.
[08:20:53] <kborchers> arthurvr: i spoke with anne about this earlier and have given you access to that repo for minor fixes but any changes to the content need to run by the board first or you can just ask anne and she'll pass it along
[08:21:05] <kborchers> agcolom: ^
[08:23:42] <arthurvr> Yeah thatâ€™s totally fine. Thanks kborchers. Though this isnâ€™t the only thing I believe is blurry about the content teamâ€™s responsability. API documentation for example.
[08:24:41] <kborchers> i thought that was clear that api docs are the responsibility of the project team
[08:25:27] <kborchers> others are welcome to contribute but it is on the project team to maintain them in the end
[08:37:17] <serge> Hello I had a question
[08:39:13] <serge> if I do (function () {})(); it should wait to execute till document ready uhuh?
[08:39:30] <arthurvr> serge: Support questions in #jquery please. Iâ€™ll be happy to answer you over there.
[08:40:34] <serge> ok I will do that. Thanks in advance.

[10:56:59] <arthurvr> is the jqcommit bot doing stange stuff? The link it just posted 404s.
[10:59:08] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[10:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> That user doesn't even exist.
[10:59:27] <scott_gonzalez> And I didn't get an email about any issue like that.
[11:00:32] <arthurvr> okay so thatâ€™s stange
[11:01:05] <arthurvr> though it is a reasonable issue number and the title seems like something related to the style guide.
[11:01:20] <arthurvr> lol github?
[11:02:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, not sure what's up with that.
