[17:10:08] <gal007> Hello people! How are you? Hope you are having a nice weekend
[17:11:02] <gal007> Sorry to bother you, but I am having a problem
[17:11:44] <gal007>  I would like to create a jquery plugin, and I started with my first version, it is working, and I followed these instructions: https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/jquery-boilerplate/wiki/How-to-publish-a-plugin-in-jQuery-Plugin-Registry
[17:12:07] <gal007> I created the repo and did all the steps https://github.com/gbosetti/browser-access-keys-activators
[17:12:18] <gal007> But I can not see the plugin at https://plugins.jquery.com/
[17:12:31] <gal007> Any idea what could be wrong?
