[06:08:44] <scott_gonzalez> Something just broke.
[06:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> error: Ref refs/remotes/origin/master is at be202484266a8322afae995cd9312850c77b6c67 but expected 3fc5185a182f044078abb5f092fcc26d69eb8046
[06:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure how that even happens.
[06:10:18] <scott_gonzalez> WTF is going on with these versions?
[06:10:46] <scott_gonzalez> Why are we going backward?
[06:11:06] <rworth> looks like I had some tags I hadn't pushed :/
[06:11:45] <rworth> v2.1.3 and v2.1.4 are superfluous to 2.1.3 and 2.1.4
[06:12:28] <rworth> oh, I see what happened
[06:12:49] <rworth> I did npm version, saw it was v2.1.4 not v2.1.7 (expected)
[06:13:00] <rworth> I did a hard reset, but forgot it had created the tag
[06:14:06] <rworth> scott_gonzalez how should I fix it?
[06:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> Now you shouldn't do anything. You've already pushed them.
[06:15:21] <scott_gonzalez> You also broke the deploy script by pushing two tags at once :-P
[06:15:34] <rworth> you mean uncovered a bug ;)
[06:16:07] <scott_gonzalez> What is it that DaveMethvin always says?
[06:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> Something like undefined input results in undefined behavior.
[06:16:56] <scott_gonzalez> Invalid input results in undefined behavior.
[06:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> Something like that.

[07:01:14] <RWhitbeck> Hey guys, looking for advice, working on the styles for jquerymobile.com and currently have my work in a jquerymobile.com branch on jquery-wp-content and pushed to my personal repo.  I want to be able to share these changes with the mobile team can I push that branch to jquery/jquery-wp-content or is there a better way to share my progress with others other then pushing to the main repo?
[07:04:02] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano scott_gonzalez rworth ^
[07:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> RWhitbeck: Why can't they just use your fork?
[07:15:44] <RWhitbeck> I could was wondering if that was the way it worked 
[07:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, you can create a branch on jquery/jquery-wp-content
[07:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> There's nothing wrong with that.
[07:17:04] <RWhitbeck> which would you prefer?
[07:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> Might as well push to a branch on the jquery account.
[07:19:21] <RWhitbeck> ok thanks

[09:11:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thought on that
[09:11:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think when he pushed twice it ran two git pulls in the same dir at the same time
[09:11:39] <gnarf> might beat the .lock race?
[09:14:12] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> I think it wasn't two pushes though.
[09:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> It was one push with 2 new tags.
[09:15:11] <scott_gonzalez> So probably 2 tag events were triggered, which caused them to run at almost exactly the same time.
[09:15:30] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[09:22:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: any idea how to handle that case "correctly"?
[09:22:37] <gnarf> i mean, each .sh should only run once at a time, i guess in the double tag case, it should do one then the next
[09:22:38] <gnarf> but
[09:22:43] <gnarf> its still not going to be "proper"
[09:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: The proper solution would likely be graceful recovery of git errors inside the bash script.
[09:24:13] <scott_gonzalez> Like, if the checkout fails, retry in a second.
[09:24:26] <scott_gonzalez> Which I know how to implement in node, but not in bash.
[09:24:49] <scott_gonzalez> While it makes the script more robust, it's also a fair amount of increased complexity.
[09:24:56] <scott_gonzalez> With fairly little gain.
[09:26:43] <gnarf> but like, there shouldn't be a git error right?
[09:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> Well, this error isn't avoidable, right?
[09:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's a lock internal to git?
[09:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> In normal circumstances, there shouldn't be a git error, because we wouldn't be pushing two new tags.
[09:29:51] <gnarf> well - i think my side of the notifier server
[09:30:03] <gnarf> COULD restrict to one running .sh file at a time
[09:30:35] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I have some code I wrote that we could use in the shell scripts for that
[09:33:29] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: https://gist.github.com/ryanneufeld/4946388
[09:36:00] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: yeah, could just hook the exec method in node-notifier with something similar too
[09:36:11] <gnarf> my thought is it should wait for the first run to finish
[09:36:14] <gnarf> then run the next
[09:36:19] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[09:36:22] <ryanneufeld> queue them up
[09:36:32] <ryanneufeld> that would work well in our use case as well
[09:38:29] <gnarf> i dunno how they would be "sorted"
[09:39:59] <ryanneufeld> FIFO
[09:40:04] <gnarf> yeah
[09:40:13] <gnarf> but i mean, what order will git send them
[09:40:23] <gnarf> pushing two tags at once would still create some weird
[09:40:28] <ryanneufeld> they're timestamped
[09:40:39] <ryanneufeld> that's in the payload data
[09:40:56] <scott_gonzalez> Not if they're lightweight tags.
[09:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> Lightweight tags don't have dates.
[09:41:13] <scott_gonzalez> They fall back to the commit they point to.
[09:41:26] <scott_gonzalez> Which could be the same ref.
[09:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> But in the case of a mistake with someone not using `npm version`
[09:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think that'd be an issue though.
[09:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> Since order wouldn't matter.
[09:41:59] <ryanneufeld> so tagA and tagB point at SHA DEADBEAF
[09:42:17] <ryanneufeld> order doesn't matter as the result is the same correct?
[09:43:12] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, everything we say is pure speculation on what GitHub is doing, unless we actually test.
[09:43:55] <scott_gonzalez> I still say that this isn't an issue we should really be concerned with.
[09:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> It should happen again.
[09:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> If it does, we'll know and it's easy to fix.
[09:48:26] <gnarf> i kind of agree, but at the same point, i could see a master + tag deploy causing two execs in some case
[09:50:34] <gnarf> i wanted to at least stop the ability for the same shell script to be run while it was already running
[09:56:37] <gnarf> i wonder if i shouldn't make notifier only process one exec at a time regardless
[09:56:42] <gnarf> opinion ryanneufeld?
[09:56:51] <gnarf> it would be the easiest answer
[09:57:00] <ryanneufeld> sec catching up
[09:57:45] <gnarf> like, make an "exec queue"
[09:57:51] <ryanneufeld> I think subsequent requests for execs of the same script could be queued
[09:58:02] <ryanneufeld> but the better option would be to queue them all
[09:58:20] <gnarf> well lets say you push jquery-wp-content AND jquery.com
[09:58:21] <ryanneufeld> though you could get into a dependency problem then
[09:58:39] <ryanneufeld> I think running one at a time is best
[09:58:43] <gnarf> should it run one then then other?
[09:58:48] <ryanneufeld> yes
[09:58:50] <ryanneufeld> I think so
[09:58:57] <gnarf> that was kinda what i was thinkin too
[09:59:20] <ryanneufeld> I don't see any harm, as long as it's FIFO
[09:59:32] <ryanneufeld> and failure of one doesn't cause the rest to not happen
[09:59:35] <gnarf> its pretty easy to implement with async.queue also
[09:59:36] <ryanneufeld> that's my biggest concern
[10:00:42] <gnarf> so, only run one script at a time
[10:01:50] <ryanneufeld> That's my vote
[10:02:14] <gnarf> then my concern would be a .sh script that doesn't exit
[10:02:16] <gnarf> but
[10:02:17] <gnarf> whatever
[10:02:27] <gnarf> dunno if i should code a timeout
[10:02:36] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[10:02:38] <ryanneufeld> tricky
[10:02:49] <ryanneufeld> a timeout makes sense

[18:15:37] <joelbirch> Hello, is anyone seeing the plugin registry delay picking up new plugin versions? I pushed a couple of versions of Superfish over the last 12 hours or so but an older version still shows in the repository. In th past it was pretty much instant. I checked the error log and it shows that my plugin was picked up successfully.
[18:23:04] <joelbirch> just emailed this to plugins@jquery.com then realised I should have waited longer before doing so. Sorry.
[18:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> joelbirch: I'll check the server.
[18:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...something killed some processes.
[18:26:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You around
[18:27:29] <joelbirch> thanks scott_gonzalez 
[18:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> joelbirch: The script that updates the site is dying on startup. It'll take a little while for me to track down the error.
[18:30:50] <scott_gonzalez> But the fact that the log says it was added means that the data was processed and stored in the db.
[18:30:55] <joelbirch> ahh, right. Appreciate you looking into it.
[18:31:14] <scott_gonzalez> So once this bug is fixed, the script that updates WordPress will catch up.
[18:31:30] <joelbirch> cool, ta
[18:37:18] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15BreakTheBarrior opened issue #253: .appendTo() - example wrong  02http://git.io/ww2tag
[18:46:35] <scott_gonzalez> son of a bitch
[18:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> Someone has a repo with a tag named 1.0.0 and a directory named 1.0.0
[18:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> so `git log 1.0.0` fails
[19:00:26] <scott_gonzalez> Damnit gnarf.
[19:00:38] <scott_gonzalez> Explain the difference between /var/log/system.log and /var/log/messages.
[19:00:52] <scott_gonzalez> logger.error() only writes to system.log.
[19:01:11] <scott_gonzalez> But logger.log() writes to both.
[19:01:16] <gnarf> i'll write a syslog rule tomorrow to put it into its own log file
[19:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> system.log has the stack trace, which would've prevented me from doing a whole lot of debugging on the server :-P
[19:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> I was looking in messages, and there was no sign of what happened.
[19:04:27] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it's /var/log/syslog on the server, it's system.log on OS X.
[19:04:40] <scott_gonzalez> Funny that I was looking in the wrong tab of my Terminal just now :-P
[19:05:06] <gnarf> syslog is *.*
[19:05:11] <gnarf> look in /etc/syslog.conf
[19:05:17] <gnarf> kinda explains the rules

[19:08:32] <joelbirch> thanks for fixing the plugin repository. *Awesome*
[19:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: There are 3 update servers running right now :-(
[19:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> They seem to all respawn on kill.
[19:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure what ghost manager is doing tht.
[19:10:29] <scott_gonzalez> Since there's only one manager running.
[19:11:14] <scott_gonzalez> joelbirch: No problem. I'm just glad the system is able to gracefully bounce back from errors like this :-)
[19:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'll admit that I expected more problems than we've had since this was the first major project I'd written in node where one error can take down the whole thing.
[19:13:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can you have puppet send an INT or TERM or the manager?
[19:13:54] <scott_gonzalez> Then bring it back up?
[19:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> See if maybe somehow that manager is tracking all three update servers.
[19:14:24] <scott_gonzalez> s/or the/to the/
[19:14:39] <gnarf> not puppet, just kill it :)
[19:14:43] <gnarf> kill -INT proc
[19:14:50] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I thought puppet tracked pids.
[19:14:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do it manually then.
[19:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> heh, oops
[19:17:49] <scott_gonzalez> How do I launch the manager in the background so I can disconnect?
[19:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> nohup?
[19:18:35] <gnarf>  /etc/init.d/plugins start ?
[19:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...that started all the scripts with --console
[19:20:09] <gnarf> huh?
[19:20:40] <gnarf> did my console flag get messed up?
[19:20:43] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/scottgonzalez/4950356
[19:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> I guess so
[19:20:48] <gnarf>  /usr/local/bin/node /var/www/plugins.jquery.com/scripts/manager.js doesn't have --console on it
[19:21:09] <gnarf> im going to stop it
[19:21:13] <gnarf> then restart?
[19:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[19:21:39] <gnarf> yeah
[19:21:44] <gnarf> there is something wrong with that --console test
[19:22:46] <scott_gonzalez> Has the manager not been restarted since you wrote that?
[19:22:55] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we've just been sending HUPs since then.
[19:30:34] <gnarf> yeah
[19:38:45] <scott_gonzalez> no luck, huh?
[19:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> We can just take out that part out for now.
[19:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> At least on the server.
[19:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> We definitely want the logs going to syslog right now.
