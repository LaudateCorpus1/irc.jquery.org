[08:43:05] <jqcommit> 13jquery-wp-content/06master 14f6d2ed2 15Richard D. Worth: plugins theme: escape html special chars in plugin description on plugin page. Fixes jquery/plugins.jquery.com#110
[09:23:51] <ed__> I'm trying to add my plugin to plugins.jquery.com. I followed all the steps, but it does not show. Here's my plugin manifest file. Did I screw something up? https://github.com/edtalmadge/Agile-Carousel/blob/master/agileCarousel.jquery.json
[09:25:57] <danheberden> ajpiano: scott_gonzalez: just thought i'd ping that i'm on airplane wifi for the next couple hours, if y'all need something from me
[09:53:57] <danheberden> ed__: http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/package-manifest/#people-fields
[09:54:07] <danheberden> it looks like your author section is missing the email and url
[09:54:13] <danheberden> oh, nevermind
[09:54:14] <danheberden> it's optional
[09:54:25] <danheberden> ok i apparently suck at helping diagnose plugins issues
[10:04:37] <ed__> Thanks danheberden
[10:12:34] <dansnetwork> What causes/triggers a specific plugin's page to rebuild: committing changes to its manifest, tagging, any action that triggers a post-receive hook, other?
[10:30:57] <nosilleg> Anyone here able to help with publishing my plugin? I fear I'm being a bit thick.
[10:34:50] <DaveMethvin> dansnetwork: the tag is what publishes
[10:35:18] <DaveMethvin> nosilleg: i don't have access to the publishing logs but i can try...
[10:35:54] <dansnetwork> @DaveMethvin I think my issue was that I tagged but didn't update the manifest first. I think I'll now have to update the version again and then re-tag.
[10:36:43] <DaveMethvin> yeah that is probably the best way to go dansnetwork
[10:37:00] <dansnetwork> @DaveMethvin Thanks for the help!
[10:37:20] <DaveMethvin> also if you haven't published successfully be sure to double check the json, you can use http://jsonlint.com/ to check it
[10:37:27] <DaveMethvin> i'm always leaving out commas
[10:41:01] <nosilleg> @DaveMethvin Do the version numbers in the manifest have to match the tag version number exactly? In one I have "1.2.0" and the other "v1.2.0". I guessing that's my problem.
[10:41:50] <DaveMethvin> that should be fine as far as I know ... we'll probably have to wait for someone who can look at the log and see what's going wrong
[10:42:01] <DaveMethvin> nosilleg: what is the link to your repo?
[10:43:25] <nosilleg> @DaveMethvin https://github.com/nosilleg/capslockstate-jquery-plugin
[10:44:13] <dansnetwork> @nosilleg you have a space in one of your keywords
[10:45:03] <DaveMethvin> nosilleg: yeah run your json through jsonlint.com and it will show you the error
[10:45:10] <DaveMethvin> trailing comma after your name field! :D
[10:45:45] <nosilleg> @DaveMethvin thanks.
[10:46:48] <DaveMethvin> i'm not sure if you can have a space in keywords, to what dansnetwork said
[10:47:04] <dansnetwork> mine initially failed because of that
[10:47:07] <DaveMethvin> i guess that would make it a key phrase
[10:47:27] <dansnetwork> http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/package-manifest/#field-keywords
[10:48:08] <DaveMethvin> well if you're gonna go and read the docs, that is cheating
[10:48:14] <dansnetwork> hrmm, I didn't have any luck with mine updating... http://plugins.jquery.com/inputosaurus-text/
[10:48:37] <nosilleg> "lock" makes for a very generic keyword
[10:48:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah i noticed the html escaping issue on that dansnetwork
[10:49:00] <dansnetwork> I'll have to wait for rworth's report
[10:49:05] <DaveMethvin> so dansnetwork you tagged with a new tag and pushed, but it didn't show up?
[10:49:16] <dansnetwork> hopefully it's not allowing <script>s
[10:49:35] <DaveMethvin> i think that got fixed in the last few hours
[10:49:52] <DaveMethvin> just need to go back and update that in the current database
[10:49:59] <dansnetwork> I updated the manifest first (0.1.4), committed, and then tagged with the same
[10:50:18] <DaveMethvin> oh the same version? i wouldn't do that
[10:50:26] <dansnetwork> uh, oh, I've encoded them in my latest manifest
[10:50:31] <DaveMethvin> you could do 0.1.4-1
[10:50:43] <dansnetwork> I previously had 0.1.3
[10:51:30] <DaveMethvin> oh you mean you committed and then git tag 0.1.4? Yeah that should be fine
[10:51:38] <dansnetwork> correct
[10:51:40] <DaveMethvin> then git push --tags right?
[10:51:45] <dansnetwork> right
[10:52:11] * rworth is back
[10:52:20] <DaveMethvin> yeah, the cavalry!
[10:52:27] <DaveMethvin> hows your wife rworth? 
[10:52:34] <DaveMethvin> the flu i suspect?
[10:53:02] <rworth> could be that, or just a severe cold, but combined with preg. it's rough. Probably has a few days left. thanks for asking
[10:54:14] <danheberden> "Probably has a few days left" i hope you mean of being sick :/
[10:54:27] <rworth> haha
[10:54:29] <DaveMethvin> if it's the flu it can take weeks
[10:54:34] <DaveMethvin> been there donethat
[10:54:39] <dansnetwork> mine was 3 weeks
[10:54:45] <DaveMethvin> yeah it just drags on
[10:54:57] <DaveMethvin> first week is the worst
[10:55:04] <DaveMethvin> i got a flu shot this year
[10:55:15] <rworth> dansnetwork your 0.1.4 tag is looking good but the server hasn't seen it. Hit the 'test hook' button
[10:55:22] <dansnetwork> will do
[10:55:27] <ed__> I'm trying to add my plugin for the first time. I followed all steps, but no luck. See anything wrong with my manifest? https://github.com/edtalmadge/Agile-Carousel/blob/master/agileCarousel.jquery.json
[10:55:49] <rworth> oops ed__ yours is the one I was looking at
[10:55:53] <rworth> dansnetwork which is yours?
[10:56:02] <dansnetwork> http://plugins.jquery.com/inputosaurus-text/
[10:56:10] <ed__> @rworth thanks, will do
[10:59:16] <dansnetwork> @rworth there we go, it just showed up
[10:59:38] <rworth> :)
[10:59:50] <dansnetwork> @rworth thanks again!
[10:59:56] <rworth> np problem
[11:00:10] <dansnetwork> was it something that I did wrong?
[11:01:02] <DaveMethvin> rworth: note the issue with html tags in the description for dansnetwork's plugin
[11:01:34] <dansnetwork> It was in this version: http://plugins.jquery.com/inputosaurus-text/0.1.2/
[11:02:52] <rworth> fixed in https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/110 though it's not live yet
[11:02:52] <b-ot> rworth, issue #110 by rdworth (2h 29m ago): Html characters in description field should be escaped
[11:03:01] <rworth> also related https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/111
[11:03:01] <b-ot> rworth, issue #111 by rdworth (2h 21m ago): Html characters in description on listing page are stripped instead of escaped
[11:06:13] <ed__> @rworth Thanks, clicking the "test hook" button worked. The plugin is now showing on plugins.jquery.com. Just FYI, the only tricky part was that when I clicked the "test hook" button on github.com, there is no response. Nothing happens. So, it felt like "test hook" wasn't working. But... it was.

[11:11:25] <DaveMethvin> rworth, so the "version" field in the json file MUST match the tag version, is that right?
[11:11:33] <rworth> yes
[11:11:47] <DaveMethvin> ok, just clarifying the docs a bit
[11:11:58] <DaveMethvin> adding a recommendtation to use a JSON verifier

[11:38:58] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: yt?
[11:39:07] <DaveMethvin> yessir danheberden
[11:39:35] <danheberden> so i'm working on the grunt plugin portion for this - thought i'd bounce off my approach to make sure i'm not crazy
[11:39:49] <DaveMethvin> sure
[11:40:32] <danheberden> grunt-init jquery will init the original plugin.jquery.json file, and also install grunt-jquery-plugin, which should use the same validation logic in the file creation to validate the file
[11:40:45] <danheberden> and since it was added by init, it can be in default task
[11:40:50] <jqcommit> 01[13plugins.jquery.com01] 15dmethvin tagged 06v1.0.11 at 06master: 02http://git.io/L1xTmg
[11:41:04] <danheberden> and do addtional things like verify the tag mentioned in the file is actually present
[11:41:05] <danheberden> etc
[11:41:37] <DaveMethvin> so it's gonna do the 20 questions thing i guess as part of the init?
[11:42:19] <danheberden> yeah - i think moving forward it would be nice if it could manage some of that, but editing the json file seems as reasonable
[11:42:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah mainly it would be good to have it validate the fields
[11:42:44] <DaveMethvin> so that's what grunt-jquery-plugin does right?
[11:42:52] <danheberden> ideally
[11:42:59] <DaveMethvin> yeah in THEORY
[11:43:09] <danheberden> i mean, i'm just learning this javascript stuff
[11:43:25] <DaveMethvin> the other thing that seems to trip people up is that the tag version and manifest version need to match
[11:43:49] <danheberden> do you mean v1.0.0 vs 1.0.0 ?
[11:44:08] <DaveMethvin> like people have 1.0.0 inthe file and then try to tag 1.0.1
[11:44:13] <DaveMethvin> perhaps there could be a task to "do a release" that would update the manifest, tag, and push?
[11:45:26] <danheberden> even if when grunt is ran, it's all "hey, the latest tag doesn't match the package.json or pluginname.jquery.json - wanna fix that?
[11:45:47] <danheberden> or a task to tag that tags and updates the json files
[11:46:00] <danheberden> i wouldn't want it pushing for the user, but automating the whole tags everywhere thing
[11:46:09] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[11:46:20] <DaveMethvin> if there are two places to do it, i know i'll miss one
[11:46:23] <danheberden> but i think checking that package.json and pluginname.jquery.json are consistent is good, as well as verifying that tag is actually present
[11:46:32] <DaveMethvin> to generalize if there are N places i will always get N-1
[11:46:38] <danheberden> haha
[11:47:04] <danheberden> perhaps this should be more general of a plugin then
[11:47:13] <danheberden> that just manages manifests
[11:47:35] <danheberden> cuz i wouldn't mind something similar for a node project
[11:47:40] <DaveMethvin> i was just updating the jquery-migrate plugin to do some of this
[11:47:48] <danheberden> the problem is i always tag after i grunt
[11:48:10] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's why a tool or grunt plugin would be nice
[11:48:19] <DaveMethvin> it's like 11 things in the right order
[11:48:45] <DaveMethvin> here's what i have for the jquery-migrate plugin atm:
[11:48:46] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/build/release.js
[11:49:28] <DaveMethvin> that still  has some bugs tho i bet
[11:49:49] <DaveMethvin> i just added the code to do the plugin release but haven't been through a release yet
[11:51:15] <danheberden> coolness
[11:51:48] <DaveMethvin> so that kinda does what we just said, it updates both manifests and tags and copies and etc
[11:52:28] <DaveMethvin> but it's a bit specific to that repo, it assumes there's just one license entry and knows which ones are references to the repo and need versions updated
[11:52:36] <DaveMethvin> but it could be generalized
[11:52:42] <danheberden> totes
[11:52:53] <DaveMethvin> make my code suck less!
[12:00:42] <danheberden> oh baby baby
[12:02:26] <DaveMethvin> danheberden or gnarf: i'm assuming we can easily add a header for files coming from code.jquery.com? http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13267
[12:03:22] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: should be - whatever we serve it with from our servers that the CDN picks it up from should be used to serve via the CDN
[12:10:30] <danheberden> now if i can just find where the configuration for that is :/
[12:12:43] <danheberden> found it
[12:13:01] <danheberden> DaveMethvin: plane is landing soon, but i'll get a PR into infra for this
[12:13:15] <danheberden> probly later tonight
[12:51:05] <gnarf> wahts the header we need?
[12:51:49] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13267
[12:52:14] <DaveMethvin> Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[12:52:18] <gnarf> just acc-con-all-ori: * ?
[12:52:32] <DaveMethvin> that's what the man says... :)
[12:52:50] <gnarf> sure... i mean, i guess nothing there accepts a post or anything anyway
[12:53:00] <gnarf> but if it helps firefox get onerrors from inside jQuery
[12:53:03] <gnarf> i suppose this is useful
[12:53:10] <DaveMethvin> right, it's really a totoally different use of CORS from AJAX
[12:53:37] <DaveMethvin> the firefox ticket he refs tells why they restricted it originally
[12:53:58] <DaveMethvin> but we don't have the "are they logged in" concern for code.jquery.com
[12:54:30] <DaveMethvin> btw hi gnarf!
[12:54:38] <DaveMethvin> sorry to keep you so busy lately
[12:54:58] <gnarf> :)
[12:55:00] <gnarf> no prob
[12:58:59] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: i added the header to origin
[12:59:10] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[13:00:40] <gnarf> i just tried to force a cdn reload on jquery.min.js as a test
[13:00:53] <gnarf> yup
[13:00:56] <gnarf> the CDN passes it through
[13:01:06] <gnarf> we might have to manually request reloads on some of the files
[13:01:17] <gnarf> but most likely over the next few days everything will pick it up
[13:02:19] <gnarf> should i resolve notabug ?
[13:02:41] <DaveMethvin> if you didn't create a ticket on infra i guess you could say fixed?
[13:03:00] <DaveMethvin> just mention that it may take a few days to propagate
[13:03:04] <gnarf> yeah, just dont want it to show up in a milestone report or anything
[13:03:57] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, i guess notabug but with an explanation
[13:04:54] <DaveMethvin> thanks!
[13:09:22] <gnarf> i just set milestone to "None"
[13:09:30] <gnarf> that should stop it from ending up in your changelog right?
[13:24:29] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: yes, that will do it thanks!
