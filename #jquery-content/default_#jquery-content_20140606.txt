[06:27:25] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I need to stop the plugins site, rebuild the node modules, then start it again. What user should I use?
[07:49:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: who owns node_modules
[07:49:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thats probably your answer
[07:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:49:53] <gnarf> though since you don't need write perms
[07:49:59] <gnarf> you can probably do all that ass root
[07:50:06] <gnarf> start/stop should use /etc/init.d/plugins
[07:50:12] <gnarf> as root
[08:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> damn, `chown -R` is taking forever
[08:08:01] <scott_gonzalez> The npm update did a lot more than I expected.
[08:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> And that didn't help anyway.

[08:13:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: blow away node modules and reinstall
[08:13:08] <gnarf> ?
[08:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:13:15] <gnarf> move it 
[08:13:18] <gnarf> instead of rm it
[08:13:20] <gnarf> just in case
[08:13:27] <gnarf> or if you already blew it up
[08:13:31] <gnarf> oh well! :)
[08:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> You wrote it in time :-)
[08:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> yay, that worked
[08:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Doesn't seem like it's restarting properly.
[08:20:53] <gnarf> shit
[08:21:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: same error?
[08:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> Nah, just two sets of scripts running now.
[08:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> I manualy killed the old set, but there might be an issue with the init.d script.
[08:22:39] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I think it's time to trim the error log.
[08:22:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so, can you do a stop on the the server, kill the scripts, and maunally start with sudo -u plugins ... --console ?
[08:23:07] <gnarf> maybe see some problem?
[08:23:12] <gnarf> if not the init script should work
[08:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try.
[08:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> To trim the error log, should I just `tail -100 error.log > error.log` ?
[08:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe we should set up log rotation for this?
[08:25:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: create an issue for it?
[08:26:08] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, `/etc/init.d/plugins stop` didn't kill the scripts.
[08:29:00] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to stop playing around with this on production
[08:29:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look into this on stage later.
[08:31:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, Panera peak time throttling :-P
