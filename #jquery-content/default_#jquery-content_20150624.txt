[13:10:49] <gnarf> :( arthurvr :(
[13:11:06] <arthurvr> gnarf: personal troll of mine donâ€™t care about it :(
[13:11:30] <gnarf> still that shits annoying - i sent a report to github, which I'm sure others already did too :)
[13:12:22] <gnarf> sorry for the sake of like, humanity
[13:13:35] <arthurvr> gnarf: did you follow the whole story? Itâ€™s god damn irritating and time consuming bro
[13:13:48] <gnarf> not all of it, just seen the end bits
[13:13:58] <gnarf> do you have a "the story thusfar" somewhere I can read?
[13:14:28] <arthurvr> not really lolz. basically comes down to getting trolled since January 7 :p
[13:14:44] <arthurvr> hunderds of tickets on many repos (including some popular ones)
[13:15:10] <arthurvr> should probably do a blogpost about these things one day
[13:15:17] <arthurvr> dunno. maybe when itâ€™s all over
[13:15:31] <arthurvr> anyways just donâ€™t care when you see those tickets and move on :p
