[06:01:31] <rworth> scott_gonzalez yes, I am still planning to port those old events pages
[06:02:00] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: When? I'd like to finish this ASAP.
[06:02:15] <rworth> and that was a less than ideal couple of updates last week. This is what Adzerk is for. We'll get that up and running before the next time we change banners
[06:02:30] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I assume you have a list of them for me?
