[08:50:08] <gnarf> jzaefferer - is there a corresponding qunitjs.com pull for me to land with this redirect?
[08:51:04] <jzaefferer> gnarf: yes, here: https://github.com/jquery/api.qunitjs.com/pull/49
[08:51:26] <gnarf> jzaefferer: i just landed the redirects on puppet-stage
[08:51:41] <gnarf> jzaefferer: looks good
[08:52:00] <gnarf> jzaefferer: do you want to take care of merging into puppet-master after you depoly that ^ ?
[08:52:24] <jzaefferer> Yeah, I can do that. Thanks!
[08:53:17] <gnarf> to force jq01 to pick up the change immediately after merging (well after the post receive hook runs) -- ssh jq01.jquery.com -- sudo puppet agent -t

[11:20:50] <gnarf> um scott_gonzalez - force push master intentional?
[11:21:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yes. Felix had force pushed and blew away some commits, so I had to restore them.
[11:21:30] <gnarf> ok 
[11:21:33] <gnarf> just making sure :)
[11:21:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not really sure why his push didn't show up here.
[11:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> But it confused the hell out of me.
[11:22:19] <scott_gonzalez> Check this out: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/commit/8258f0c
[11:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> That was the bad commit that he force pushed.
[11:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's undiffable!
