[08:15:49] <jqcommit> 13jquery-wp-content/06banner 14121d06e 15Richard D. Worth: Added an event banner in the header. wip: needs to set the right image filename based on site theme bg color
[08:16:12] <rworth> scott_gonzalez can you help me finish up https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/tree/banner
[08:16:40] <rworth> just needs a conditional. Don't know if we want to base it on domain name or add a new value in sites.php
[08:17:11] <rworth> this isn't the long-term plan, but until we get adzerk working (and have more than one ad) I'd like to get it up like this
[08:26:13] <scott_gonzalez> We really want to customize the ads per site theme?
[08:26:45] <scott_gonzalez> Shouldn't the ad use colors based on what the ad is for, not which site it shows up on?
[08:40:31] <ajpiano> i think it looks nicer if it matches the site theme
[08:40:56] <ajpiano> having a bunch of blue
[08:41:03] <ajpiano> in the other sites, is less than good
[08:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> What about neutral color like the gray one?
[08:42:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just wondering if this is something we're going to want to continue to do.
[08:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> If it is, that's fine.
[08:42:36] <ajpiano> i like th idea of it growing up out of the menu area in the right colour
[08:42:42] <ajpiano> it's not like this is some precedent we are bound to
[08:42:54] <ajpiano> if we want a different look for ads for diff conferences, we can do that
[08:43:13] <ajpiano> but i think given the design doing it in site specific colours is the right decision
[08:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:44:34] <jqcommit> [13jquery-wp-content] 15dariusk opened pull request #229: Add autofocus attribute to search template (06master...06master)  02http://git.io/ikLA7w
[08:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Just have <aside><?php some_function(); ?></aside>
[08:44:44] <scott_gonzalez> And define the function in each theme.
[08:45:11] <scott_gonzalez> Or even just define it in the base theme and do a switch on the domain.
[08:45:20] <scott_gonzalez> That's essentially what the real solution will do anyway.
[09:02:24] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I was trying to not get too fancy, but whatever you think is best. This will be in place for days or a week. The real solution will (I'm pretty sure) be a single id on a div in the aside and adzerk does the rest, based on the domain name
[09:02:31] <rworth> plus other factors we can control from there
[09:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, you want me to write the function?
[09:03:55] <rworth> scott_gonzalez that would be great. thanks
[09:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Check the banner branch now.

[10:00:01] <rworth> ok
[10:05:27] <rworth> scott_gonzalez looks great. thanks so much
[10:05:38] <rworth> ready to merge to master and kill the branch?
[10:05:38] <scott_gonzalez> you're welcome
[10:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:10:03] <scott_gonzalez> Don't want to duplicate a tag, so which one of us is doing this?

[10:22:01] <rworth> scott_gonzalez jquery.org seems to be having the same problem I had locally
[10:22:07] <rworth> a cached version of base.css
[10:22:17] <rworth> where the others are fine
[10:22:32] <rworth> notice the 20px margin below it
[10:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> The only way to fix that is to append a query string to the <link>
[10:24:28] <rworth> any idea why it's an issue on that site but no others?
[10:24:47] <scott_gonzalez> Because you don't have the others in your cache.
[10:25:01] <rworth> hmm, they all have ?v=1
[10:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> They've always had that. It never updates.
[10:25:21] <rworth> but locally and in prod I only saw the problem on jquery.org
[10:25:41] <scott_gonzalez> It's your local cache.
[10:25:45] <rworth> I guess
[10:25:54] <scott_gonzalez> Refresh and it'll go away.
[10:26:29] <rworth> shift-refresh isn't making it go away, but it's not there in incognito mode. ok
[10:26:44] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[10:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> We can change the v=1 to v=2
[10:27:04] <scott_gonzalez> Right now that's fully manual.
[10:27:10] <rworth> right
[10:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> The v=1 is hard-coded in header.php
[10:27:25] <rworth> that'll be part of the build process we'll add someday
[10:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> correct
