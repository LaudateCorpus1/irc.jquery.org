[13:05:46] <uGoMobi> anyone got Vaultpress plugin error messages in admin panel when installing WordPress / jquery-wp-content local?
[13:05:58] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez agcolom RWhitbeck ^^
[13:06:48] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: During installation or after?
[13:06:49] <RWhitbeck> I haven't but it's been awhile since I got everything installed. 
[13:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> And actual error messages or just a warning?

[13:07:08] <uGoMobi> after installation
[13:07:19] <uGoMobi> seems like installation on itself went fine
[13:07:57] <uGoMobi> just get those warnings on several places in the admin panel
[13:08:46] <uGoMobi> got the feeling something is done twice
[13:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> I don't get that error.
[13:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> What version of PHP?
[13:13:43] <uGoMobi> I think 5.4.10
[13:13:50] <uGoMobi> let me check that
[13:15:29] <tj_vantoll> uGoMobi: I got those as well.
[13:16:39] <tj_vantoll> I believe I just ignored them and it hasn't adversely affected my work on the sites.
[13:18:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'm on 5.3.15, so it could be something new in 5.4
[13:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> tj_vantoll: What version of PHP are you using?
[13:19:55] <tj_vantoll> Where might I find that. php.ini?
[13:21:14] <tj_vantoll> Ah looks like 5.3.15
[13:21:49] <uGoMobi> 5.4.10 here, I checked
[13:22:56] <uGoMobi> after refreshing the warning goes away from some panels, but it stays on top of the page

[13:25:25] <uGoMobi> it also says VaultPress requires a monthly subscription :/
[13:25:57] <scott_gonzalez> uGoMobi: You don't need, or even want, VaultPress running locally.

[13:26:09] <scott_gonzalez> You really shouldn't even be in the admin section of the sites.
[13:26:52] <uGoMobi> right, it's just that you get there after installation
[13:29:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm not sure why you two see those messages, but I don't.
[13:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> I tried tuning on all error messages, but they still didn't show up.
