[04:23:24] <shoo> hi!
[04:36:07] <rworth> shoo hi!
[04:43:12] <shoo> for some reason I can't joint he general #jquery channel, thats weird
[04:43:27] <shoo> and jeez, its been years, a lof of them, since I was on irc for the last time huh!:)
[04:44:39] <shoo> anyway, I was wondering and maybe someone can answer me. Is jQuery logo licensed under MIT just like jquery library and project in the whole? Can I use it on shirts / stickers / etc? Can't seem to find definite answer to that ;)
[05:09:40] <rworth> the jQuery logo is not licensed under MIT, it is protected by Trademark held by the jQuery Foundation
[05:09:59] <rworth> you can find a little bit of info on http://brand.jquery.org/
[05:10:26] <rworth> if you want to license it for any commercial use at all it happens that I'd be the person to discuss that with. You can shoot me an email richard@jquery.com
[05:11:15] <rworth> shoo ^^
[05:30:43] <shoo> hey! thanks for heads up, will send an email
[05:31:09] <shoo> that true when you google for 'jquery brand' your page is first, but when you google for 'jquery logo', 'jquery logo license' nothing comes up :)
[05:54:56] <rworth> we're prepping a clear logo license page, should be up within weeks

[09:55:12] <ajpiano> hate to bail late but i can't do a meeting today all, sorry
[10:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> WHAT WILL WE DO WITHOUT YOU?!?
[10:00:43] <agcolom> ajpiano: ok, no problem :-)
[10:03:24] <kswedberg> I actually gotta bail, too. sorry yall
[10:06:30] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do you have 2 minutes? 
[10:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[10:07:07] <agcolom> hi, great! so that thing with the collapsible...
[10:07:36] <agcolom> I removed the collapsible event type but it still shows... 
[10:08:21] <agcolom> it that automatic now?
[10:09:12] <agcolom> (i removed the  event-prefix attribute in the entry tag)
[10:09:36] <agcolom> (only on my local repo)
[10:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> Deleting the event-prefix will just cause it to use the widget name as the prefix.
[10:10:34] <agcolom> oh!
[10:10:44] <scott_gonzalez> It's incorrect for a widget to ever trigger an event without using ._trigger().
[10:10:53] <scott_gonzalez> Which collapsible must be doing if it has events that aren't prefixed.
[10:11:45] <agcolom> yes, I was told that the event for create is collapsiblecreate but for collapse and expand, there is no prefix
[10:12:46] <agcolom> do you think the code needs to be changed then... I guess that if it is done like this, there must be a reason...
[10:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> Which is really really bad (from the implementation)
[10:13:25] <scott_gonzalez> It cannot be documented as an event because it is not a widget event.
[10:13:35] <agcolom> ok.
[10:13:42] <scott_gonzalez> For example, there is no associated callback.
[10:13:50] <agcolom> right ok.
[10:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know why they would have done that, but it's breaking our common API.
[10:14:16] <agcolom> so that's why I was asked to remove expand and collapse from the collapsibleset probably then 
[10:15:08] <agcolom> I'll follow whatever you say :-)
[10:16:51] <agcolom> would it be worth you having a chat with the dev guys?... or do you want me to find out more (i.e. are these real events?)
[10:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> I can see that they are not.
[10:18:19] <agcolom> ok, so what should I do about the doc ?
[10:18:35] <scott_gonzalez> I dunno, but they are not widget events.
[10:18:49] <scott_gonzalez> Write about it in the description section?
[10:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> Get them to fix their code :-)
[10:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> I'll say something in -dev.
[10:19:19] <agcolom> sounds like a good idea. Then I can do the same for the collapsibleset then.
[10:19:27] <agcolom> Thank you :-)
[10:21:38] <agcolom> and then I was going to remind you about the template for events (like the one for methods) (whenever you have time :-) )
[10:21:43] <agcolom> Thank you :-) 
[10:21:48] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ^
[10:22:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, it's now the only remaining issue for grunt-jquery-content.
[10:22:45] <agcolom> and then that's it. Been crazy busy... should be getting better now... then I'll be away on holiday for 2 weeks with no internet... for the 2 first weeks of April.
[10:23:48] <agcolom> mid april - end july should be more quiet workwise, so I'll have more time for the jQuery stuff...
[10:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'll add the event support next week.
[10:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> I promise :-)
[10:25:19] <agcolom> thanks :-) and thanks again for updating the mobile api yesterday as well.. I had fallen behind (just too much work)
[10:25:46] <scott_gonzalez> No problem, I was adding permalinks for methods.
[10:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> Let me find an example.
[10:26:21] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...well that's kinda boring.
[10:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> Mobile doesn't have any overloaded methods :-P
[10:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.navigate/#jQuery-mobile-navigate-url-data
[10:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> The signature is now a link and shows the link icon.
[10:26:50] <scott_gonzalez> So you can easily link directly to a method signature.
[10:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's more useful if there are multiple signatures.
[10:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> For example, http://api.jqueryui.com/show/#show-options
[10:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> vs. http://api.jqueryui.com/show/#show-effect-options-duration-complete
[10:29:55] <agcolom> oh, nice...
[10:30:07] <agcolom> did you see my comment about the switch?
[10:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I don't think we can do that. They're separate sites.
[10:30:51] <agcolom> ok.... would have been nice ...
[10:31:11] <agcolom> are you sure it can't be done?
[10:31:36] <scott_gonzalez> Not in a sane way.
[10:32:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure it solves the problem anyway. I think they want to see both at the same time.
[10:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm not sure why.
[10:32:11] <scott_gonzalez> I could be wrong.
[10:32:19] <agcolom> (so when switching to say api, it's like clicking on a link of the api doc for that widget
[10:33:07] <agcolom> if they want to see both at the same time, they need 2 browser tabs ;-)
[10:34:47] <agcolom> are you saying "Not in a sane way" because we couldn't automate the link url?
[10:38:17] <scott_gonzalez> Automating the URL is easy.
[10:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> But if this button is literally just al ink, then we already have that from demo -> docs
[10:39:27] <agcolom> yes, but not the other way round
[10:40:41] <agcolom> so either a switch or a button or a link at the top to easily move from one to the other and make that consistent on both the api and demo pages
[10:41:16] <scott_gonzalez> The problem isn't discovery.
[10:42:18] <scott_gonzalez> The request is having them on the same page.
[10:42:25] <agcolom> it would reduce the number of clicks to go from a given widget api to its demo page
[10:43:00] <agcolom> ok, so if the request is to have them on the same page then I don't know how best to do that...
[10:43:16] <agcolom> are you sure that's what people want?
[10:43:35] <scott_gonzalez> "I find myself switching back and forth between the demo site and the api subdomain pretty regularly. Since the demos don't take up that much room, the api documentation could sit underneath without it looking out of place. The benefit of having them on the same page is that you can work out how to do something from a demo, and then search for implementation details in the api."
[10:43:59] <agcolom> ok, sorry ;-)
[10:44:22] <scott_gonzalez> I think most people don't know what they want.
[10:44:26] <agcolom> (if I was in that situation, I would open two browser tabs...)
[10:45:48] <agcolom> so we could have a link from a given widget api page to the corresponding demo page and people could right-click -> open in new tab...???
[10:45:56] <agcolom> would that help?
[10:46:32] <scott_gonzalez> As I said, the problem isn't discoverability.
[10:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> We can add those links.
[10:47:12] <agcolom> either way, we can't win because people have to either swich or scroll...
[10:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> exactly
[10:47:35] <scott_gonzalez> Like I said, I don't think people really know what they want.
[10:47:47] <scott_gonzalez> If we put them on the same page, it's going to be HARDER to cross-reference.
[10:47:55] <scott_gonzalez> Because now you're scrolling up and down.
[10:48:05] <scott_gonzalez> With 2 tabs, you keep context/scroll as you switch.
[10:48:05] <agcolom> yes, definitely. Scrolling is not good
[10:48:26] <agcolom> exactly...
[13:36:21] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Is there any reason to keep https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-api around?
[13:36:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to copy the jsonp code, but I'm not sure it'll help too much with the new implementation.
[13:37:08] <kswedberg> other than that, no. no reason to keep.
[13:37:37] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:39:07] <scott_gonzalez> It's going away now :-)
[13:39:24] <kswedberg> bye bye!
[14:01:19] <rmill> This looks like it was done a long time ago, but I just checked on the live site https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/266
[14:01:20] <b-ot> rmill: Issue #266 by rmillr (6d 6h ago): Examples on api.jquery.com are pointing to jquery-latest
[14:01:23] <rmill> Yay! Go team.
[14:17:00] <kswedberg> rmill: thx for that issue. glad we got that updated.
[14:56:02] <rmill> kswedberg: Not even a huge deal, but I could see people copying/pasting that.
