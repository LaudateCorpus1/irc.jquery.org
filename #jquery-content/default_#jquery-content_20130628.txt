[05:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Daily bump for old events :-)
[05:20:03] <rworth> scott_gonzalez thanks. I'm actually on it now that the banners are up and the @jqcon video tweets are starting to go out
[05:20:29] <rworth> speaking of banners, adzerk got back to me, because of how their caching works, the changes we were making yesterday take 30min
[05:20:41] <rworth> they hope to get it down to a few min by the end of the month
[05:21:01] <rworth> but it should work, and they're around this morning to help out
[05:21:35] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: if we need to remove  "In API documentation, use 2 spaces instead. This helps keep the line width manageable and avoid horizontal scrollbars." from https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/README.md who should do this?
[05:21:47] <agcolom> (and when)
[05:22:22] <scott_gonzalez> Don't they know about 5 second caches?!?
[05:22:27] <rworth> :)
[05:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I can do it right now.
[05:22:37] <agcolom> ok
[05:22:54] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[05:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: done :-)

[06:12:43] <kswedberg> agcolom, scott_gonzalez: I think we can just get rid of that last example. seems like a rare edge case to me.
[06:14:02] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Thanks. That's what I thought too.
[06:14:22] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I can do that now. I have a few minutes before I get back to my vacation. :)
[06:14:36] <scott_gonzalez> great :-)
[06:18:23] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: what do you think about agcolom's other question? the one about api docs using two spaces?

[06:19:27] <kswedberg> I like 2 spaces, especially with the responsive design. but I will defer to others if there is a groundswell of support for switching to tabs. 
[06:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: The rendered pages use 2 spaces.
[06:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> But the source files use tabs.
[06:20:14] <scott_gonzalez> Well, they're *supposed* to use tabs.
[06:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> When you were writing the docs directly in WordPress, you had to use spaces in the source.
[06:21:16] <scott_gonzalez> But now that we have a build process, we can go back to following our normal standards while still having the smaller indentation on the site.
[06:24:42] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: oh, cool! yeah, I think all the core api docs are still using spaces. so I guess we can start moving them to tabs and change that readme
[06:28:35] <agcolom> kswedberg: scott_gonzalez and I also had a question about grammar: "Any styles that cannot be animated will be changed at the end of the animation." (is any styles ok or should it be any style?) We think both are ok, but wanted to check with you.
[06:35:38] <kswedberg> agcolom, scott_gonzalez : either one is fine.
[06:35:51] <scott_gonzalez> Hooray, I was right :-)
[06:36:03] <kswedberg> :-)
[06:55:12] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: kswedberg Perfect! Thank you very much... not off to give a revision lecture on mobile computing principles... 
[06:56:28] <agcolom> now off ^ (not not!!!)

[12:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> eddiemonge: Looks good.
[12:52:24] <eddiemonge> how about this:
[12:52:25] <eddiemonge> Understanding how events propagate is an important factor in being able to leverage Event Delegation. Any time one of our anchor tags is clicked, a *click* event is fired for that anchor, and then bubbles up the DOM tree, triggering their click event handlers:
[12:52:56] <eddiemonge> or: triggering each of its parent click event handlers
[12:59:17] <eddiemonge> scott_gonzalez: ok cleaned up. ok to merge?
[13:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> That sounds good to me.
[13:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> You've got a +1 from me to merge.
