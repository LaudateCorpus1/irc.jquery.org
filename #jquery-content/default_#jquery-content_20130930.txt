[05:18:08] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: for tagging api sites, we still use build numbers?
[05:18:43] <scott_gonzalez> No.
[05:18:59] <jzaefferer> ah, no, using patch
[05:19:06] <scott_gonzalez> We just had the discussion about not using build numbers for anything because npm implements proper semver now.
[05:19:24] <jzaefferer> I could've looked up the discussion before pinging you...

[05:21:48] <jzaefferer> TJ suggested adding a Deploying to Staging and Production Environments" section to http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/ - what do you think about that?
[05:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> Not adding, just providing a summary of the discussion. The section already exists.
[05:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's a good idea.
[05:23:22] <jzaefferer> ah, right
[05:23:24] <jzaefferer> I'll add that now
[05:24:16] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[05:26:21] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: how does that look? http://bassistance.de/i/2a88f6.png
[05:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably document when to use which.
[05:32:25] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: How about this? http://bassistance.de/i/4c9c13.png

[05:38:39] <jzaefferer> what is this? https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/commit/0a35f9be619770fdabe08f5db59b7a82845f57fe
[05:38:39] <b-ot> jzaefferer: Anne-Gaelle Colom (2w 3d ago): 1.0.13
[05:39:36] <jzaefferer> agcolom: looks like you somehow tagged a commit that doesn't exist in master, so I ended up committing the same version again
[05:39:39] <jzaefferer> s
[05:40:12] <jzaefferer> so I can't push the tag, since it already exists, but I ended up pushing the commit with the version increment anyway :/
[05:40:19] <jzaefferer> gonna just bump again
[05:40:21] <agcolom> oh? how is that possible

[05:40:55] <jzaefferer> I'm not sure, but that commit is headless, it can only be referenced from the tag
[05:40:57] <agcolom> that was because I made a change to the text
[05:41:11] <jzaefferer> and `git pull` doesn't fetch disconnected commits like that
[05:41:45] <agcolom> this is the 'parent'
[05:41:46] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/commit/cc2fdb6d7c67fb26c2271445883f7fc21ade1329
[05:41:46] <b-ot> agcolom: Anne-Gaelle Colom (2w 3d ago): contribute.jquery.org: fixed an error in the text of web-sites.md
[05:42:01] <jzaefferer> well, good thing I documented that now: http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/ look for "Deploying to Staging and Production Environments"
[05:42:18] <jzaefferer> using `npm version patch`, then `git push --tags origin master` should be the way to go
[05:42:35] <agcolom> this is exactly what I did!
[05:42:46] <jzaefferer> weird
[05:42:55] <jzaefferer> somehow that version increment didn't land in master
[05:43:02] <jzaefferer> the commit that changes package.json
[05:44:00] <agcolom> strange! I did it in Austin, and I followed exactly Scott's instructions
[05:47:10] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: ^^^ any idea how that could've happened?
[05:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> She must not have been in master when she tagged.
[05:50:52] <agcolom> I can see the 2 commands I typed... 
[05:51:08] <agcolom> sorry, the 3
[05:51:58] <agcolom> The commit, the push and then `npm version patch, then `git push --tags` (I didn't have origin master)
[05:52:05] <agcolom> could that be the problem?
[05:52:19] <agcolom> jzaefferer: scott_gonzalez ^
[05:52:40] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[05:52:58] <scott_gonzalez> `git push --tags` only pushes the tags, not the commits.
[05:53:02] <agcolom> Sorry :-( 
[05:53:08] <scott_gonzalez> Which causes broken deployments.
[05:53:52] <gnarf> hrm
[05:54:00] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Can you add a note on that page to use `git push --tags origin master` ?
[05:54:13] <gnarf> should this be an issue on jquery-wp-content or contribute: https://www.dropbox.com/s/vxr1hhgwtpz2o5t/Screenshot_2013-09-30-08-47-43.png
[05:54:36] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-wp-content
[05:54:42] <scott_gonzalez> I think it might even exist. Let me check
[05:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: File an issue. It looks like we only have it covered as a comment on a related issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/183#issuecomment-13058598
[05:56:11] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Issue #183 by tjvantoll (8mon 1w ago): Page does not take up full width on iOS
[05:57:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/265
[05:57:21] <b-ot> gnarf: Issue #265 by gnarf (1m 33s ago): Inline code blocks can break mobile layout
[06:12:36] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: jzaefferer: is this something you're able to recover? (really sorry :-( )
[06:13:16] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: No, not after someone else pushed commits.
[06:13:54] <scott_gonzalez> But you're probably going to make a bigger mess next time you pull/push.
[06:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> You should probably `git fetch origin master` then `git reset --hard origin/master` if you have no local changes right now.
[06:15:00] <agcolom> ok...
[06:16:30] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: just done that...
[06:16:34] <agcolom> it said HEAD is now at cc2fdb6 contribute.jquery.org: fixed an error in the text of web-sites.md 
[06:17:07] <agcolom> so that should be ok?
[06:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: No, that's not the right commit. Do you not have origin pointed at the jquery account?
[06:25:32] <agcolom> I did git clone at the time
[06:25:46] <agcolom> I guess I should have jzaefferer's commit as the last one
[06:25:51] <scott_gonzalez> up
[06:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> *yup
[06:27:11] <agcolom> could it be I have upstream instead of origin?
[06:29:33] <scott_gonzalez> Yes. `git remote -v` will tell you what your remotes are.
[06:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> Whichever points at jquery is the one you need to fetch and reset from.
[06:34:26] <agcolom> https://gist.github.com/agcolom/4cfe4beff3875952f936
[06:34:58] <agcolom> (sorry I'm a bit slow... I'm in a tutorial!)
[06:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> So origin points to jquery.
[06:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> `git fetch origin master` should be pulling in jzaefferer's commit.
[06:38:23] <scott_gonzalez> What was the output when you ran that before?
[06:39:22] <agcolom> Anne-Gaelles-MacBook-Air:contribute.jquery.org anne-gaellecolom$ git fetch origin master
[06:39:22] <agcolom> remote: Counting objects: 21, done.
[06:39:22] <agcolom> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (11/11), done.

[06:39:32] <agcolom> Anne-Gaelles-MacBook-Air:contribute.jquery.org anne-gaellecolom$ git reset --hard origin/master
[06:39:34] <agcolom> HEAD is now at cc2fdb6 contribute.jquery.org: fixed an error in the text of web-sites.md
[06:39:51] <agcolom> From github.com:jquery/contribute.jquery.org
[06:39:51] <agcolom>  * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
[06:40:50] <agcolom>  this time: ^
[06:41:28] <agcolom> so the whole thing is: https://gist.github.com/agcolom/9f9b59dfef1336134e08
[06:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> What happens if you `git pull` right now?
[06:42:02] <agcolom> just git pull (not git pull --rebase?)
[06:42:11] <scott_gonzalez> Just `git pull`
[06:42:24] <scott_gonzalez> You shouldn't have anything to rebase at this point.
[06:42:52] <agcolom> https://gist.github.com/agcolom/7a0aaa5c002019065d0c
[06:43:46] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, you should be good now.
[06:44:01] <agcolom> Thank you! 
[06:44:03] <scott_gonzalez> What does `git log --oneline -1` show?
[06:44:10] <scott_gonzalez> You should get: 5d16667 1.0.14
[06:44:20] <agcolom> 5d16667 1.0.14
[06:44:41] <agcolom> Sorry for messing everything up! 
[06:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you should be good now.
[06:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> No problem. The mess wasn't too big :-)
[06:45:17] <agcolom> I won't forget that! 
[07:47:23] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: deployment with `git push --tags origin master` instructions: http://bassistance.de/i/81d35f.png
[07:47:48] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good.
[07:48:58] <jzaefferer> the CLI line is inline, but it doesn't break, so that should be fine

[07:52:04] <jzaefferer> agcolom: next time you make a site change and forgot some detail, peek at http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/ under "Deploying to Staging and Production Environments". And please let me know if that is missing something.
[10:09:38] <Mottie1> Is this the best place to ask about issues with searching the jQuery site?
[10:20:59] <gnarf> Mottie1: likely here
[10:23:41] <Mottie1> I tried to search for "Event Object" and while it did show events, it showed everything... I just wanted to get to this page: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[10:24:55] <Mottie1> same thing for just about any category level pages
[10:38:30] <scott_gonzalez> Categories don't show up in search results.
[10:50:35] <Mottie1> ok, but it might be nice to include :)
[10:54:19] <Mottie1> I have one more quick question I have about hasClass()... check out this demo: http://jsfiddle.net/QUbJ8/ is this a bug? or is that not a supported feature? Should this be mentioned in the docs?
[11:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> To me the docs are pretty clear that .hasClass() only accepts one class name.
[11:02:47] <scott_gonzalez> "Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned THE GIVEN class."
[11:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> "THE class name to search for."
[11:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's also ambiguous to what .hasClass("a b") would mean.
[11:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> "a && b" or "a || b"
[11:04:04] <Mottie1> ok, no biggie... I'm probably the only one to every ask this :P
[11:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> I know you're not, actually.
[11:05:09] <scott_gonzalez> I can probably find at least one bug report for this.
[11:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> Well, here's one for a feature request: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13949
[11:05:58] <Mottie1> I just ran into this problem when I allow users to assign class names to elements... then later I have to search for it and I assumed (incorrectly) that the user would only use one class name 
[11:06:15] <scott_gonzalez> I guess there were no bug reports for this, just a feature request.
[11:06:32] <Mottie1> still, it's not a problem :)
[11:06:48] <scott_gonzalez> Use .is() and s/\s+/\./ /
[11:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> ugh, that last / was supposed to be ?
[11:07:05] <Mottie1> lol
[11:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> Going back to your first comment, we probably put way more info in our category pages than a normal WordPress user.
[11:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> So it probably is useful to show our category pages.
[11:09:13] <Mottie1> well, there isn't any other way to get to the event objects page unless you click on the side link
[11:10:05] <Mottie1> well, I guess you can by clicking on the label in the search results
[11:10:23] <Mottie1> EventsÂ >Â Event Object
