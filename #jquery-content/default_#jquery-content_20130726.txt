[08:47:35] <scott_gonzalez> yo
[08:48:07] <gnarf> you poking around on code?
[08:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> I was, then Richard called. Just got off with him.
[08:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'm purging more files right now :-/
[08:48:56] <gnarf> more purge?
[08:49:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna push this to a branch for you to review.
[08:50:04] <scott_gonzalez> There's massive inconsistencies in mobile even after the purge.
[08:50:17] <scott_gonzalez> We need to talk to someone from the mobile team about what belongs on the CDN.
[08:50:31] <scott_gonzalez> There are even duplicate files with differnet names.
[08:50:37] <gnarf> jdorfman: ping
[08:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta go run an errand. I'll be back soon.
[08:53:07] <gnarf> k, should I work on color index?
[08:53:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[08:53:27] <scott_gonzalez> Just pushed to a purge branch.
[08:53:33] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm not done with the purge.

[08:53:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need to pull in someone from mobile to finish that.
[08:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> Back in about an hour.
[09:04:30] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: gnarf : gseguin is in charge of releases, I think it's best to talk with him
[09:07:39] <uGoMobi> all the ZIPs of the stable releases have been copied to jquerymobile.com/releases/
[09:08:35] <uGoMobi> have to update a few links on jquerymobile.com/download/ but then we remove those from the CDN
[09:08:46] <uGoMobi> s/we/we can/
[09:13:47] <uGoMobi> I just updated and tested all links to ZIPs on the download page
[09:16:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: FYI ^^^
[09:40:30] <gseguin> uGoMobi: note that I only put "stable" releases there, that does not include alphas and betas
[09:41:03] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I can copy them over as well if needed
[09:41:11] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes was thinking about that too
[09:41:32] <gseguin> ok let me do that now
[09:41:38] <uGoMobi> do we still need those on the server?
[09:41:53] <gseguin> just if you want to alter old blog posts
[09:42:03] <gseguin> and get rid of the cdn zips
[09:42:25] <uGoMobi> ah right, there are still links in the blog posts :(
[09:46:42] <gseguin> uGoMobi: any interest in me copying over the doc zips ?
[09:48:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: um
[09:48:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ping when you're back
[09:48:27] <uGoMobi> gseguin: maybe good to wait until scott_gonzalez is back
[09:48:28] <gnarf> afk myself a minute
[09:49:19] <gseguin> uGoMobi: you know what I'll copy all the zips over
[09:49:24] <gseguin> it can't hurt
[09:49:57] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok, we can always move or delete
[09:50:20] <uGoMobi> gseguin: just don't know how we are supposed to organize things on the server
[09:50:43] <uGoMobi> gseguin: but you can discuss that with scott_gonzalez and gnarf 
[09:50:49] <gseguin> if it's just zips, having them living it the same directory is fine
[09:57:52] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ok it's copying, it should be done in a few minutes
[09:58:05] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok thanks
[10:00:59] <scott_gonzalez> back
[10:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf
[10:03:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: skype quick?

[10:56:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: there is a release without svgNames and plusNames

[10:56:11] <gnarf> so fixed that
[10:56:27] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I must've missed that when I looked.
[10:56:47] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: question - does wordpress emit any events when a page is updated?
[10:57:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure there are actions you can hook into.

[10:58:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i meant in grunt-wordpress
[10:59:08] <gnarf> can i somehow do some action with the pages that were updated
[10:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> On the node side or the PHP side?
[10:59:38] <gnarf> i.e. send an http request to http://local.codeorigin.jquery.com/ui/?reload
[10:59:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: node side
[10:59:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it knows the pages it changes
[11:00:04] <gnarf> i just want to also send the queue to request the cdn reload it
[11:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think grunt provides a way to proxy a helper.
[11:04:01] <scott_gonzalez> It's only going to be about half a dozen pages total, right?
[11:04:11] <scott_gonzalez> So we can just queue a refresh of all of them on every deploy.
[11:04:16] <gnarf> sure
[11:05:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'll look into whether there's a more efficient way for us to do it.
[11:05:33] <scott_gonzalez> But grunt doesn't provide great architecture for this type of stuff.
[11:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> So I think the only clean way to do this would be to add a hook inside grunt-wordpress.
[11:26:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure it's worth it to avoid refreshing 3 or 4 pages.

[13:07:42] <agcolom> ??
[13:08:04] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: was that about the resources page? 
[13:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:08:15] <agcolom> you don't like it?
[13:08:50] <scott_gonzalez> Managing a link of articles about jQuery Mobile is crazy.
[13:08:56] <scott_gonzalez> s/link/list/
[13:09:03] <agcolom> I've been doing it for the last 2 years :-)
[13:09:42] <agcolom> You want one for UI? ;-)
[13:10:37] <scott_gonzalez> I actually explicitly do not want one :-)
[13:12:25] <agcolom> ok :-) but people do like the mobile resources page. (Seriously!) 
[13:13:02] <agcolom> maybe because it's not always easy to find resources on the topic... and here you have everything...
[13:22:27] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: I'm back
[13:22:37] <agcolom> uGoMobi: should the gbs page be what we support with the latest version?
[13:23:13] <gseguin> agcolom: that would be my guess
[13:23:25] <agcolom> hey gseguin :-) 
[13:23:28] <gseguin> hey
[13:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: The newer releases have jquery.mobile.theme-{version}.css.
[13:23:53] <agcolom> will you or have you uploaded the zip files to jquerymobile.com? 
[13:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> But those are listed on the index page.
[13:25:08] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: starting when?
[13:25:37] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: looks like that started in 1.1.0
[13:25:58] <gseguin> but basically if you want to clean up the cdn, I would remove all the zip files
[13:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> 1.1.0
[13:26:19] <gseguin> and change the blog posts to reflect the move
[13:26:19] <scott_gonzalez> Ok deleting zip files now.
[13:26:25] <gseguin> wait
[13:26:27] <gseguin> wait
[13:26:39] <gseguin> we need to update the blog posts first
[13:26:47] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: ^^^
[13:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> Can that get done this weekend?
[13:27:29] <gseguin> I don't know 
[13:27:48] <gseguin> how easy is it to do a search and replace on wordpress content?
[13:27:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: for now the gbs can stay like it is
[13:28:03] <uGoMobi> because 1.3.2 is latest stable version
[13:28:07] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: what's the rush?
[13:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> The CDN switch.
[13:28:41] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, I've not checked whether it is already up to date (on the new site)
[13:28:42] <gseguin> oh and you want to make sure we don't put garbage on the new one
[13:28:49] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[13:29:03] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: when is the switch taking place?
[13:29:04] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, we had to delete a TON of files from mobile.
[13:29:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: np
[13:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> Please make sure future releases are clean.
[13:29:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: on the new site we have to add supported browsers list for each version
[13:29:31] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: ASAP
[13:29:40] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: what's in 1.4.0-alpha.1 is what we now output for release
[13:29:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: if we update gbs now people may think JQM 1.0 works with iOS6 without issues
[13:30:00] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: There is no 1.4.0-alpha.1 on the new CDN. So you'll need to fix that too.
[13:30:02] <gseguin> we should not have demos in there
[13:30:12] <agcolom> uGoMobi: sure, no pb
[13:30:30] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/tree/master/cdn/mobile
[13:30:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: resources page looks very neat!
[13:31:07] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: cool
[13:31:19] <gseguin> do I have access to this?
[13:31:35] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it might be insane, but it is a very nice page :)
[13:31:46] <agcolom> uGoMobi: thx :-) Ralph had moved most to the content already, so I jsut had to update it with the latest changes, but as I am the one who did those, it was easy :-) 
[13:32:08] <agcolom> I changed the article colors to be all jQuery secondary colors
[13:32:12] <uGoMobi> great RWhi
[13:32:17] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: 
[13:32:18] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: so to put something on the cdn, no more rsync or scp ?
[13:32:27] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, saw that
[13:32:40] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: No, but uGoMobi does. gnarf: We probably need a release team or something.
[13:32:41] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: just a git add / commit / push?
[13:32:46] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: correct
[13:32:52] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: nice!
[13:33:17] <gseguin> ok I'll clone that guy
[13:33:45] <uGoMobi> what did i do?
[13:34:38] <uGoMobi> ah, I have access
[13:34:44] <gseguin> and I'll work on modifying our Gruntfile so it doesn't copy demos
[13:34:50] <gseguin> uGoMobi: you do 
[13:34:59] <gseguin> uGoMobi: and me wants that
[13:35:27] <agcolom> I'm happy to help with updating the blog posts, but I do not have access. I may be able to do some now and/or tomorrow afternoon or sunday... 
[13:35:38] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, uGoMobi has access to every repo because he's an owner.
[13:36:29] <uGoMobi> agcolom: access to what?
[13:36:34] <agcolom> blog posts
[13:36:34] <gseguin> the blog
[13:36:59] <uGoMobi> you mean WordPress access on jquerymobile.com?
[13:37:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom I see you are editor there
[13:37:34] <agcolom> I have Wordpress access but I don't think I have access to the blog posts. 
[13:38:18] <agcolom> Because when I was spotting typos, I had to email them and could not make the changes myself...
[13:38:40] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I changed your role to admin
[13:38:52] <agcolom> oh, thx
[13:38:53] <uGoMobi> can you try again?
[13:39:02] <gseguin> gnarf: could you let me know when you have time to create a release team that has push access to codeorigin.jquery.com
[13:39:28] <gseguin> gnarf: in mobile arschmitz and gseguin should be part of that team
[13:39:49] <agcolom> Also, I can't find my password... so I can only use one specific computer that remembers me! Do you have my password by any chance?
[13:40:01] <gseguin> s5fs, ryanneufeld: ^
[13:40:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: if you see uGoMobi is your Jabber username in your wordpress profile... that was Chrome autocompleting forms :/
[13:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: created
[13:41:05] <gseguin> kewl, thanks scott_gonzalez!
[13:46:18] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: ERROR: Permission to jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com.git denied to gseguin.
[13:47:23] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: gseguin if you can let me know what needs to be changed on the blog posts when you're done, I'll be able to do that this weekend... maybe some today... 
[13:48:41] <gseguin> agcolom: any post referencing a jquery.mobile-*.zip should change the paths to http://jquerymobile.com/releases/jquery.mobile-*.zip
[13:49:09] <agcolom> gseguin: ok, thanks
[13:49:27] <gseguin> and you can start whenever because the files have already been copied
[13:52:26] <agcolom> ok, I just want to check something with scott_gonzalez first
[13:53:05] <agcolom> we want this to work also when we switch to the new site, right?
[13:53:22] <gseguin> correct
[13:53:33] <gseguin> how are we doing the new site?
[13:53:45] <gseguin> how do we transfer data?
[13:54:07] <agcolom> ui goes jqueryui.com/resources/downloads/filename.zip
[13:54:29] <agcolom> just git add, git push I think...
[13:54:54] <gseguin> ok I don't mind changing the tree structure to that now
[13:55:05] <agcolom> I've moved to working on the new site on wednesday I think
[13:55:24] <gseguin> It makes sense to have something consistent with the other projects
[13:55:54] <agcolom> I think that would help, but I'd like scott_gonzalez 's view, just to check that I'm not missing something.
[13:56:05] <agcolom> then we can do the changes just once
[13:56:15] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: are we migrating the content of our current wordpress into the new one?
[13:56:35] <gseguin> agcolom: totally
[13:57:08] <agcolom> gseguin: see for ui: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/tree/master/resources/download
[13:58:25] <gseguin> ok
[13:59:22] <agcolom> on mobile, I think it's just about adding the download folder and the zip files in there
[13:59:39] <agcolom> here's what we currently have: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/tree/master/resources
[14:00:08] <gseguin> yup but then I wonder how we're going to import the existing content
[14:00:11] <gseguin> if we are
[14:00:23] <agcolom> what existing content?
[14:00:33] <agcolom> you mean site content?
[14:00:35] <gseguin> the existing blog posts on jquerymobile.com
[14:01:07] <agcolom> yes, the blog posts... that's a complete mystery to me...
[14:01:47] <agcolom> you can see what we currently have on http://stage.jquerymobile.com but yes, no idea how the posts will be done
[14:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> The blog posts are completely separate from the rest of the site.
[14:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> Though once again mobile has diverged from the common path, so it's a bit trickier.
[14:05:10] <gseguin> what do you mean "once again", are we the rebels? :P
[14:05:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, on pretty much every single piece of infrastruce.
[14:05:36] <scott_gonzalez> s/infrastruce/infrastructure/
[14:06:41] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: did you see my questions above regarding the location of the zip files and tree structure we should adopt?
[14:06:53] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: did you see I don't have access to the cdn repo
[14:06:57] <agcolom> (I'd rather do the changes to the blog posts only once)
[14:07:09] <gseguin> I just tried to push 1.3.2 and 1.4.0-alpha.1
[14:07:46] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: is there a plan ( and is it even possible ) to import the blog into the new wordpress?
[14:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Sorry, it didn't save the repo, fixed now.
[14:08:04] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: thanks
[14:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: The blog is a completely separate site. None of the blogs are being moved yet.
[14:08:18] <scott_gonzalez> But you will need to move to the new theme.

[14:09:04] <gseguin> oh ok so agcolom here is what we can do
[14:09:37] <agcolom> yes?
[14:09:49] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Yes, you'll need to follow the /resources/ URL structure.
[14:09:59] <gseguin> we can replace all the links to code.origin.jquery.com/mobile/{version}/jquery.mobile-{version}.zip by
[14:10:23] <gseguin> http://jquerymobile.com/resources/download/jquery.mobile-{version}.zip
[14:10:35] <agcolom> yes, please :-)
[14:10:44] <gseguin> and for the time being create a resources/download directory on the eol2 server
[14:11:02] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: does that sound like something that would work?
[14:11:08] <agcolom> you create that ^ ?
[14:11:20] <gseguin> agcolom: yes
[14:12:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[14:12:56] * gseguin goes on to move the zip files to that location
[14:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> I have to go. Driving to NY tonight. I won't be on much during the weekend.
[14:17:24] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, have a good weekend... 
[14:17:25] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ^ I'll be able to help finish things up on Monday. Then I really need to finish the plugins site changes so I can get back to UI.
[14:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks agcolom. You too.
[14:17:33] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: ok, so I'll change the release script to push to the git repo
[14:17:45] <gseguin> what's on the repo should be good
[14:17:55] <gseguin> we still have to sort out where to host the demos
[14:17:56] <agcolom> does that mean I don't need ot rush and I can just have until monday morning UK time to do this?
[14:18:00] <gseguin> have a good weekend
[14:18:05] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ^ and thanks :-)
[14:18:19] <gseguin> agcolom: I copied the zip files
[14:18:32] <agcolom> gseguin: brilliant! Thank you :-)
[14:18:43] <gseguin> I'll edit the last blog post
[14:18:50] <gseguin> and will let you do the rest
[14:18:50] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Yeah, the new version looks good. Has exactly the files I would expect.
[14:19:13] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: that was done manually
[14:19:27] <gseguin> I'll change the release script to reflect that
[14:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I don't know what gnarf's plans are for the weekend. I know he was aiming for today to do the switch, which is why I spend 2 days on this.
[14:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> But if it were me, I'd wait till Monday for the switch.
[14:20:06] <scott_gonzalez> Later.
[14:21:06] <agcolom> yes, it's quite late here now and my eyes are starting to feel funny + I was up at 6am!
[14:21:33] <agcolom> so I think I won't rush to do this this evening... might be route to disaster ;-)
[14:22:15] <agcolom> gseguin: sounds like a good plan :-)
[14:22:21] <gseguin> agcolom: I just edited the last blog post
[14:22:34] <gseguin> the rest is yours
[14:22:52] <agcolom> great. I think I'll do the others this weekend... might be risky to do this evening ;-)
[14:23:04] <gseguin> I also removed the release directory so there is no confusion as to where to find the files
[14:23:14] <gseguin> oh yeah no rush on this
[14:23:24] <agcolom> perfect! 
[14:23:42] <gseguin> I think the only important one might be 1.3.2 post
[14:23:44] <agcolom> and I'm on holiday now until the 4th Sept :-)
[14:24:03] <gseguin> the rest it's only to prevent 404
[14:24:15] <gseguin> agcolom: and then it's Austin time!
[14:24:30] <agcolom> yes, I'll have 3 days at work, and fly out :-)
[14:24:49] <agcolom> so I have 1 month to prepare my talk!
[14:25:05] <agcolom> (well I've started already!)
[14:28:03] <agcolom> I think I'd better get some rest now :-) have a good weekend :-)
[14:41:52] <gseguin> you too agcolom
