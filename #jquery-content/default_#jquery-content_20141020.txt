[03:48:43] <Ninj> Hi here. Am i on the right chan for bugs on the jQuery sites?
[03:49:52] <Ninj> When i'm trying to download jQuery-UI with custom-theme, i get a beautiful "Ooops! An unexpected error seems to have occurred. Why not try refreshing your page? Or you can contact us if the problem persists." Any reason?
[05:24:09] <scott_gonzalez> Ninj: Are you still having problems?
[05:24:12] <scott_gonzalez> It's working for me.
[05:28:53] <Ninj> scott_gonzalez: yes, but i managed it through.. IE :)
[05:29:15] <scott_gonzalez> Which browser was it failing in?
[05:29:46] <Ninj> ff chrome safari
[05:30:09] <scott_gonzalez> Can you paste your URL?
[05:30:31] <Ninj> the interesting fact was that i had a "folder name" input in those browsers, but not my co-worker
[05:30:50] <Ninj> sure: http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/#!downloadParams=version%3D1.11.2%26components%3D1111101000111110000011000001000100010&zThemeParams=5d000001002606000000000000003d8888d844329a8dfe02723de3e56fef6015a89a811c9e49f38c067c0ec127abdac572a3d95e991a1a04d197f40e3bbcbbd5ebb75c5d025283cced7ebfde8774e8665eb408f4b6d180cee53953aafbe54e4ffa6132df83f9aba1e5a5704e8eff471aef663343d74a4800a41608a44342a43bed05b9344c7c94b51b1f3dc9969c10fa3909
[05:33:03] <Ninj> when i follow this link, then clock on the download button from the theme roller page, i get on the component selection page (download builder), but with this extra input. and clicking on Download there brings the error
[05:37:45] <scott_gonzalez> Is that actually loading a custom theme for you?
[05:37:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'm just getting the default theme and an error in the console.
[05:42:54] <Ninj> it is actually loading my theme
[05:43:01] <Ninj> even after i cleared the cache
[05:43:14] <Ninj> oO
[05:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> interesting
[05:45:23] <Ninj> no, sorry: after i cache wipe, this link takes me to the Download builder page, but correctly configured
[05:45:47] <Ninj> but clicking on Download still does Ooops
[05:57:52] <scott_gonzalez> Ninj: Can you file an issue at https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/issues/new ?
[05:58:06] <scott_gonzalez> Include the URL and a description of the problem.
[05:59:25] <Ninj> i'll try to do that after work today :)
