[09:58:20] <jquicommit> 13jqueryui.com/06master 140fdce8a 15J√∂rn Zaefferer: Update download.jqueryui.com to 1.10.0pre.1, to test multi-version support on stage
[10:02:53] <ajpiano> gnarf: when you get a chance can you set up contribute.jquery.com subdomain
[10:02:58] <ajpiano> etc.
[10:03:26] <ajpiano> now that we are settled on .com
[10:04:30] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: We should probably deploy all the sites just to make sure nothing breaks when we deploy contribute.
[10:04:46] <ajpiano> yeah, i need to tag web base template and learn anyway
[10:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> Right, it's the tagging of web-base-template that has potential problems.
[10:05:08] <ajpiano> i'm not sure how adding a new site affects the existing sites in stage/prod
[10:05:17] <ajpiano> cause yeah, usually i just DROP TABLE JQUERY;
[10:05:22] <ajpiano> and then run the install again
[10:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> We know our sites all work with current web-base-template, so it's probably easier to just tag all the sites than to check if they'll break if they're not redeployed.
[10:05:45] <gnarf> ajpiano: I think it "just works"
[10:05:59] <gnarf> adding a new site that is
[10:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You don't need anything for nginx?
[10:06:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: just DNS and setting up the deploy script
[10:06:13] <ajpiano> it will just add all the tables for wp_19_whatevs
[10:06:14] <ajpiano> ?
[10:06:22] <gnarf> ajpiano: i believe so - cc @nacin
[10:06:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I think that's what ajpiano is asking you to do :-)
[10:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Yeah, the WordPress portion is automatic.
[10:06:46] <ajpiano> ah, sweet
[10:06:53] <scott_gonzalez> The first time you visit a site that doesn't exist, it creates it.
[10:06:58] <gnarf> yeah, doing that now, just saying, i don't think there is any interferrence on the wordpress side at all to the process
[10:07:03] <ajpiano> ah ok
[10:07:14] <ajpiano> yeah the other pieces though... dns, hooks, adding it to this chan etc
[10:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> cool
[10:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> How soon do you plan on getting this live?
[10:08:42] <ajpiano> ASAP, i suppose
[10:08:50] <ajpiano> could announce it and learn at the same tim
[10:08:56] <ajpiano> then they'll both feel more beta-ey
[10:09:04] <ajpiano> instead of like, the fanfare of new sites
[10:09:25] <ajpiano> and jquery.github.com was already live
[10:10:58] <gnarf> ajpiano: dns up for contribute
[10:11:50] <gnarf> ajpiano: no repo of the same name yet, you want me to create it?
[10:12:08] <ajpiano> gnarf: https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.com
[10:12:20] <gnarf> doh typpo
[10:12:23] <ajpiano> lolol
[10:12:37] <gnarf> contribtue
[10:14:15] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Ok, I'll try to re-deploy all the existing with an updated web-base-template this afternoon.
[10:14:33] <ajpiano> great
[10:14:37] <ajpiano> i'll draft a blog post about both sites
[10:14:54] <agcolom> good evening :-)
[10:18:44] <gnarf> ajpiano: everything should be setup, deployers and irc hooks and dns
[10:19:12] <ajpiano> gnarf: Domain mapping issue. You have web-base-template configured for stage.jquery.com. is coming up
[10:19:19] <ajpiano> but i assume that DNS need to propogate
[10:20:47] <gnarf> it needs to be in web-base-template
[10:20:49] <gnarf> then that happens
[10:20:59] <ajpiano> ah
[10:21:09] <gnarf> in the mean time, that error is what you see whenever the domain name doesn't match one of the ones defined in web-base-template
[10:21:11] <ajpiano> oh right, it's still in a PR

[12:52:56] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano gnarf: Does this list look right?
[12:53:24] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com, api.jqueryui.com, api.jqueryui.com/1.8/, jquery.com, qunitjs.com, api.qunitjs.com, learn.jquery.com
[12:53:43] <ajpiano> what's it supposed to be a list of
[12:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> Everything in production.
[12:54:09] <scott_gonzalez> Things that are affected by web-base-template deploys.
[12:54:11] <ajpiano> i do believe so
[12:54:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, they all look good on stage (just fixed an issue with api.jqueryui.com/1.8/ menu headers.
[12:54:54] <scott_gonzalez> I'll push out an update for all of them right now.
[12:55:00] <ajpiano> cool
[12:55:07] <ajpiano> i'm working on fleshing the contribute content a bit more
[12:59:40] <jquicommit> 01[13api.jqueryui.com01] 15scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/TGgpKw

[13:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do we have deployments for api.jqueryui.com/1.8/ setup?
[13:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: All the sites look fine without needing a deployment.
[13:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> With the exception of the 1.8 UI API site, which I'm not sure if we can even deploy :-P
[13:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> Figures the one site that's busted is the one odd-ball.
[13:05:11] <ajpiano> look fine locally?
[13:05:26] <ajpiano> cool
[13:05:34] <ajpiano> i will have some template changes on contribute to do
[13:06:02] <ajpiano> and have some incremental learn stuff from the last week
[13:06:09] <ajpiano> so we can do a deploy later
[13:06:12] <ajpiano> a tag
[13:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> YAY. It worked.
[13:07:34] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I deployed web-base-template and the API sites.
[13:07:40] <scott_gonzalez> Everything on production looks good.
[13:08:00] <scott_gonzalez> So whatever changes you need to do for learn and contribute should be fine to tag whenever you're ready.
[13:08:06] <ajpiano> ok
[13:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> Those shouldn't have any affect on other sites.
[13:08:11] <ajpiano> should i just merge this to master, then https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/pull/140
[13:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that looks good to me.
[13:09:21] <ajpiano> ok
[13:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: <3 the deployment emails
[13:09:47] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: what's the best way to link directly to a page from the sidebar
[13:10:11] <scott_gonzalez> Add an anchor?
[13:10:18] <ajpiano> right but referencing it
[13:10:19] <ajpiano> oh wow
[13:10:25] <ajpiano> that was kinda derpy
[13:10:28] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like there's something I'm missing in your question.
[13:10:28] <ajpiano> lol
[13:10:49] <ajpiano> i guess i figured there might be some special wordpress thing but i suppose <a href="/foo"> does the trick
[13:11:06] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, just write out the path like any other link.
[13:11:16] <ajpiano> thought too hard about the special magic in menu-header.php
[13:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> There's no need to try to write it in some generic way.
[13:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> Just make sure to include the trailing slash.
[13:11:32] <ajpiano> which does all that path magic
[13:11:32] <ajpiano> ok
[13:11:35] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise there will be a redirect.
[13:13:30] <ajpiano> ok
[13:13:47] <ajpiano> i'm adding a sidebar and pages for how, gnereally, to contribute to code, docs, websites, and support
[13:14:20] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[13:30:29] <ajpiano> hey scott_gonzalez have you seen this thing where the font awesome icons are looking squished
[13:31:26] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, got a screenshot?
[13:31:51] <ajpiano> oh super weird it's only happening on chrome for windows
[13:32:08] <ajpiano> http://gyazo.com/6ac8979e23688a9c37c74f0b7cacc2a2
[13:32:35] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> That's funny looking.
[13:32:53] <ajpiano> yea
[13:33:01] <ajpiano> it's happening to the icon in the search box on all sites too
[13:33:25] <scott_gonzalez> Have you verified on a second Windows machine?
[13:33:41] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: ^
[13:35:16] <ajpiano> not yet. i haven't
