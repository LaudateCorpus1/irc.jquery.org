[04:29:31] <bepolite> hello agcolom 
[04:29:34] <bepolite> How did the meeting go?
[04:37:36] <agcolom> hi, bepolite so here's the change
[04:40:22] <agcolom> anything with a new infrastructure to support is an issue as there is the long-term maintenance aspect to consider.
[04:40:25] <agcolom> we could improve the current jQuery Learning Center (learn.jquery.com) to add small entries for users to test their understanding, for which http://koans.herokuapp.com/en seems to be a good solution, so for example, where we have http://learn.jquery.com/jquery-ui/getting-started/#jquery-ui-basics-using-options we could add something like http://jsbin.com/gofirumecu/1/edit?html,js,output 
[05:25:09] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi @agcolom. Any news about the blog post that was scheduled for last week?
[05:35:01] <arthurvr> Haha. This week then guys? :p
[05:35:20] <arthurvr> I think it was quite ready to go isnâ€™t it?
[05:38:07] <agcolom> yep
[05:38:46] <agcolom> I've asked AurelioDeRosa for a link to the preview to double check and we're good to go
[05:40:01] <arthurvr> agcolom, AurelioDeRosa and co: Iâ€™m not sure Iâ€™ll be able to attend to the meeting today. Sorry! Also sorry for not being able to work on much last week :/ Next week will be better :)
[05:40:29] <agcolom> arthurvr: no problem at all. 
[05:42:03] <agcolom> BTW I'll be away for 2 weeks from friday, so won't be able to make the meeting on the 8th April. Shall we just cancel that one?
[05:42:38] <arthurvr> Sounds okay to me.
[05:43:43] <AurelioDeRosa> If we don't have something important to discuss, we can cancel it
[05:44:37] <bepolite> thanks for the update agcolom 
[08:39:19] <jacquerie> agcolom, I won't be applying to GSoC after all. I'm currently employed by CERN, which is among the sponsoring organizations, hence it would be against GSoC rules. Thanks for answering my questions!
[09:01:06] <kswedberg> agcolom: ugh! so sorry. afk during content mtg again today. :( 
[09:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Such a slacker :-P
[09:03:30] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: heh. you pegged me! 
[09:09:17] <synbium> hi

[09:11:28] <arthurvr> Hey synbium!
[09:11:41] <arthurvr> synbium: What projects are you interested in?
[09:13:17] <synbium> Chassis - Styling Components for JS Libraries
[09:13:43] <synbium> Globalize - Runtime code (smaller and quicker) for production
[09:14:07] <synbium> QUnit - Better diff output
[09:14:29] <synbium> jQuery UI - new demo system
[09:15:16] <arthurvr> You need to be in #css-chassis #globalize #jquery-dev and #jqueryui-dev for those
[09:18:03] <synbium> and what can i do in this..?
[09:18:38] <arthurvr> This channel is, as you can see in the topic, meant for discussion regarding documentation and our websites.

[11:10:25] <AurelioDeRosa> So, I guess we don't have anything important to discuss in the next meeting. Correct?
[11:10:34] <AurelioDeRosa> Also, I didn't get who is in charge for the tweet
[11:11:00] <agcolom> No, nothing important 
[11:11:20] <agcolom> It's possibly Adam (ajpiano)
[11:11:45] <agcolom> ajpiano: are you in charge of the tweeter account? 
[11:11:53] <AurelioDeRosa> Thank you for the answers
[11:11:57] <agcolom> (to advertise http://blog.jquery.com/2015/03/25/come-help-the-jquery-foundation/)
[11:12:22] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: you're welcome :-)
[11:19:02] <AurelioDeRosa> OK, so I'll get back to work. See you people and have a nice week. Enjoy your holiday agcolom.
[11:19:19] <arthurvr> Bye AurelioDeRosa!
[11:21:23] <AurelioDeRosa> Bye arthurvr

[12:42:33] <arschmitz> For anyone interested in learn.jquery.com interactive tutorials i made a quick POC 
[12:42:35] <arschmitz> https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-tutorials
[12:42:52] <arschmitz> based on the idea arthurvr and i came up with in the meeting today
[12:45:23] <sigorilla> Thank you, arschmitz!
[12:49:23] <arschmitz> sigorilla: your welcome
[14:09:31] <bepolite> arschmitz, Not sure I understand the tutorial
[14:10:10] <bepolite> Are we to validate the users input using tests?
[14:10:17] <bepolite> and qunit?
[14:27:45] <arschmitz> bepolite: thats the idea
[14:28:07] <arschmitz> its not just "user input" though it will validate a file they have edited
[14:28:22] <bepolite> okay
[14:28:55] <arschmitz> in the sample folder
[14:29:17] <arschmitz> the pass and fail are examples of something someone would have edited to complete the tutorial 
[14:29:31] <arschmitz> bepolite: and the index.html is what they would start with
[14:30:03] <bepolite> thanks for the clarification
[14:30:36] <arschmitz> bepolite: no problem the main idea is to reduce maitnence costs by not having any sort of infrastructure
[14:31:51] <bepolite> arschmitz, I was thinking that the user will input a file on a web interface
[14:31:59] <bepolite> using <textarea>
[14:32:00] <bepolite> etc
[14:32:08] <bepolite> Sorry will input his edits
[14:33:24] <bepolite> Just the way it is done here http://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-bay3D/0/1?curriculum_id=50a3fad8c7a770b5fd0007a1
[14:35:31] <arschmitz> yeah thats requires infrastructure and overhead
[14:35:40] <arschmitz> and they can still edit their files via web
[14:35:43] <arschmitz> using the github editor
[14:36:08] <arschmitz> bepolite: there is a huge team of people paid to work on code academy we dont have those kind of resources
[14:39:52] <bepolite> So will th totorials be linked et You move to tutorial 2 after finishing tutorial one
[14:41:01] <bepolite> arschmitz, SO basically users are to edit the files on a their text editors or on github?
[14:41:16] <arschmitz> yes their choice
[14:41:24] <arschmitz> and to check results they just open the file in a browser
[14:41:33] <arschmitz> which can be done from github with a bookmarklet
[14:41:34] <arschmitz> or local
[14:41:53] <arschmitz> as fars as moving between them i was thinking just an index would suffice but open to suggestions 
[14:47:26] <bepolite> arschmitz, One little problem about the users having the pass.html file is that he/she can Just decide to view the contents of this file if  the task is difficult
[14:47:39] <bepolite> And that may not be helpfull to him/her
[14:48:54] <bepolite> So at the end of this project, there should be  couple of directories just like yours for each  excercise?
[14:54:07] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15mikerandall opened issue #680: jQuery with Angular requests assets multiple times when CORS is enabled on webserver 02http://git.io/jmeg
[15:03:19] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15kswedberg closed issue #680: jQuery with Angular requests assets multiple times when CORS is enabled on webserver 02http://git.io/jmeg
[15:08:27] <arschmitz> bepolite: they wont
[15:08:36] <arschmitz> thats an example of something they would make
[15:09:10] <arschmitz> the folder would only contain the test.js index.html and readme.md
[15:09:46] <arschmitz> they would edit index.html
[15:11:53] <bepolite> Ahh that makes sense
[17:38:59] <aluka_> hello agcolom can you help in jquery learning center ?
[17:46:12] <lezard> I think they are afk, its past midnight where they live
[17:49:40] <Guest54534> lezard - should we submit any patch code for gsoc ?
[17:50:09] <lezard> I don't know im on the learning center project as well, I think the proposal should be enough
[17:50:32] <lezard> Im sending mine with a draft plan on what technology I'll use, a couple projections on how much time I'll take for both coding and IA 
[17:51:05] <Guest54534> lezard do you have any template for writing gsoc propasol ?
[17:51:17] <lezard> Not really, I just follow my heart lol
[17:51:24] <lezard> And ask questions from mentors
[17:51:35] <lezard> I'd be glad to help you guys anyway
[17:52:00] <lezard> even if this is a "competition" its all about the open source coding if someone is better than me, Its better for jquery if they are selected
[17:52:09] <lezard> money is cool but, helping people is cooler
[17:52:55] <aluka_> lezard> yo 
[17:53:50] <aluka_> are u doing this in nodejs or any frame work like code-ignitor ?
[17:57:54] <lezard> you mean my proposal?
[17:58:27] <lezard> mine is for the interactive learning center, I'm thinking on using AngularJS, why?
[17:59:04] <aluka_> interactive and jquery learning center are not same ?
[18:20:11] <lezard> They are I guess, why?
[18:49:39] <aluka> lezard> both are same , just i asked you how u are trying for that ? as i am new to this
