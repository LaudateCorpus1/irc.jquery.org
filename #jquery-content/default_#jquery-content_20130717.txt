[10:17:04] <gnarf> jdorfman: ping
[10:18:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ping too
[10:18:26] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm going to add the files from code.origin to a content repo
[10:18:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: curious what you'd call the folder - I was just thinking about calling it code/ inside code.jquery.com
[10:18:51] <gnarf> or maybe even origin/
[10:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> It's going to be a jquery-wp-content site?
[10:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this isn't for actual publishing, it's for syncing to the CDN, right?
[10:21:37] <scott_gonzalez> In that case, /code/ or /cdn/ seems fine.
[10:23:21] <jdorfman> hey
[10:24:22] <jdorfman> before we point DNS can we have (mt) whitelist our IP Blocks?
[10:25:09] <gnarf> jdorfman: heh - thats a stretch - are you guys being blocked at the moment?
[10:25:36] <jdorfman> no no, we just want to make sure that we have a healthy connection to the origin
[10:25:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: and yes - i need to eventually make it a jquery-wp-content site
[10:25:52] <jdorfman> it isn't mandatory just a suggestion
[10:25:53] <gnarf> jdorfman: i'll put in a support request about it - yes
[10:25:57] <jdorfman> k
[10:26:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but this part (all the files) will >not< be synced via wp-content 
[10:26:29] <gnarf> it's just going to be another folder living nearby
[10:26:30] <scott_gonzalez> Right, it'll just be a directory in the root of the repo.
[10:26:57] <scott_gonzalez> Not in /resources/
[10:27:28] <gnarf> yu
[10:27:41] <scott_gonzalez> Which, BTW, means that a connection to the origin would not be a connection to (mt).
[10:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you're referring to our sites like jquery.com connecting to the CDN to load jQuery.
[10:28:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: um - yeah it will - it will be serving origin from jq01.jquery.com
[10:28:35] <scott_gonzalez> Why not just use GitHub?
[10:28:45] <gnarf> because the index.html is going to be wp-content generated?
[10:29:21] <scott_gonzalez> Let's start from the beginning.
[10:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> The CDN URLs will continue to be code.jquery.com/*, right?
[10:30:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yes - and those URL's will be served from codeorigin.jquery.com/ which will be a wp-content site that has an extra nginx try_files pointing at the code.jquery.com/cdn/ folder first, then try php
[10:31:19] <scott_gonzalez> That redirect isn't bad for CDN perf
[10:31:20] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[10:31:24] <gnarf> redirect?
[10:31:28] <gnarf> what redirect?
[10:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> How does code.jquery.com go to codeorigin.jquery.com?
[10:32:04] <gnarf> the CDN polls for files from an "origin" server the first time it trys to load something
[10:32:17] <gnarf> and then stores/re-serves based on cache headers
[10:32:44] <gnarf> so code.jquery.com/jquery.js will load from a cache after it grabs it from codeorigin.jquery.com/jquery.js the first time
[10:32:53] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[10:33:08] <gnarf> jdorfman: i got that right right? ^^^^
[10:33:56] <jdorfman> I thought it was code.origin.jquery.com
[10:34:13] <jdorfman> it takes 2 hits to cache
[10:34:55] <gnarf> jdorfman: code.origin.jquery.com is currently in use by the (mt) cdn --- I wanted to set this one up on a different domain just so we could actually start testing this deploy before we flip code.jquery.com over
[10:35:27] <jdorfman> oh ok that is fine I will update the origin, do you have a wildcard SSL cert you want to use?
[10:35:41] <gnarf> not yet - :( will do this VERY soon
[10:36:46] <jdorfman> ok let me know, it is really easy to install: http://support.netdna.com/howto/setup-private-ssl/
[10:37:09] <jdorfman> that way you don't have to email it to me
[10:37:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: So how does codeorigin.jquery.com first try code.jquery.com/cdn/ if code.jquery.com is just a cache of codeorigin.jquery.com?
[10:38:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: meaning the github repo checkout (jquery/code.jquery.com.git)/cdn/ is tried first, then passed to the standard php
[10:38:48] <scott_gonzalez> gotcha
[10:39:05] <scott_gonzalez> That makes sense.
[10:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> So let's either call it cdn or cdn-origin.
[10:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> And put it in the root.
[10:40:04] <scott_gonzalez> So, just to make sure I'm following everything: We'll have a repo named code.jquery.com which will be deployed only to codeorigin.jquery.com.
[10:40:47] <scott_gonzalez> If so, it seems a little confusing, and we may want to just name the repo codeorigin.jquery.com.
[10:42:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but like in the end - it's on code.jquery.com :)
[10:42:54] <gnarf> intenrally on the wp-content tho - it'll be codeorigin.jquery.com
[10:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, but any discussions about how this works will be confusing if it's named code.jquery.com.
[10:43:32] <gnarf> okay, i'll rename the repo before I move much further here
[10:43:37] <gnarf> one more cdn related question
[10:44:07] <gnarf> you think we can kill this folder: https://gist.github.com/gnarf/20fc1a5dde5e77dd9bed
[10:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[10:44:29] <gnarf> http://code.jquery.com/nightlies/
[10:44:41] <scott_gonzalez> Did we already kill the Mobile nightlies?
[10:45:05] <gnarf> yup
[10:45:27] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see any reason to keep these around.
[10:45:31] <jdorfman> brb
[10:45:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hrm
[10:45:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so this is kind of disturbing: 
[10:46:27] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/gnarf/42bacc8401622877adcd
[10:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:47:19] <gnarf> think i can ignore those warnings safely?
[10:47:48] <scott_gonzalez> Should be able to.
[10:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's disturbing that any version of jquery-migrate has this problem.
[10:48:51] <scott_gonzalez> What the hell is cdn/mobile/git.old/ ?
[10:49:50] <gnarf> my guess its it's due to dave being the builder of those versions
[10:50:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: *shrug*
[10:50:30] <gnarf> I'm pushing this commit up to github right now - this is gonna be a big repo :
[10:50:31] <gnarf> :)
[10:50:48] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:50:52] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, gonna go run my errands.
[10:51:11] <gnarf> oh bull
[10:51:11] <gnarf> remote: error: File cdn/mobile/git/jquery.mobile-git.zip is 393.50 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100 MB 
[10:52:06] <gnarf> so - significantly smaller than i thought ;)
[10:54:18] <gnarf> heh -- https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/commit/17cc138c9dd6f937b64a03369e72fd84779659ab

[11:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> hah, that's awesome.
[11:51:14] <scott_gonzalez> Why did we have zips on the CDN anyway?
[11:52:32] <jdorfman> ^^
[11:56:26] <jdorfman> gnarf: keep getting this on `grunt deploy` for jqueryui.com - https://gist.github.com/jdorfman/872fc218c004f01921ef
[11:57:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^ ?
[11:57:10] <gnarf> jzaefferer: ^ ?
[11:57:43] <scott_gonzalez> node -v ?
[11:58:00] <jdorfman> v0.10.5
[11:58:45] <scott_gonzalez> That might be the problem.
[11:58:58] <jdorfman> what version should it be?
[11:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> We might not be ready for 0.10 yet.
[11:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> 0.8.x
[11:59:16] <jdorfman> FWIW the others deployed fine
[11:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com is much more complicated than other sites.
[11:59:34] <jdorfman> ah
[12:01:10] <jdorfman> I will skip ui for now, don't want to ef up my env
[12:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> This stack track is kinda tricky to follow.
[12:02:21] <jdorfman> k brb quick meeting
[12:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> jdorfman: I can confirm that I get that error with 0.10.5, but not with 0.8.x
[12:20:22] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try to track this down. I thought rxaviers and I had fixed all the 0.10 support issues for this site.
[12:22:48] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, this is a grunt problem.
[12:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[12:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe it's a bug in node 0.10.5 actually.
[12:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, same problem in 0.10.13.
[12:25:40] <scott_gonzalez> So this seems like it'd be a bug in grunt.
[12:29:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, it's a bug in grunt.

[12:31:13] <jdorfman> back sorry thanks for confirming scott_gonzalez 
[12:31:33] <scott_gonzalez> We can work around the bug pretty easily though.
[12:32:09] <scott_gonzalez> In grunt.js on line 174, just add an empty string as another parameter.
