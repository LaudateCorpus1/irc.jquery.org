[00:00:01] <agcolom> kswedberg: scott_gonzalez: I have a question about English for you... In selector.xml, we have "Plugins that need to use a selector should have the caller pass in the selector as part of the plugin's arguments during initialization." 
[00:00:41] <agcolom> Should this be "should have the caller passed in the selector" ?
[00:01:14] <agcolom> unless pass here is a noun... 
[00:01:27] <agcolom> As I'm not sure, I thought I'd check with you
[04:27:42] <scott_gonzalez> Pass is a verb here. To reword it, "The caller should pass in the selector..." The current wording looks correct to me.
[05:12:45] <agcolom> the caller is the subject then! sorry I read this wrong
[05:12:54] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: kswedberg ^ 
[07:20:27] <kswedberg> agcolom, scott_gonzalez: I don't think the current wording is wrong, but it took me a while to understand what it meant. What do you think of this as an alternative? https://gist.github.com/kswedberg/6029710
[07:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> Looks good.
[07:26:14] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: kswedberg great! Thanks! So are you happy for me to incorporate it now on the cleanup branch
[07:26:38] <kswedberg> sure. go for it. :)
[07:26:43] <kswedberg> agcolom â†‘
[07:26:51] <agcolom> Perfect! Thanks
