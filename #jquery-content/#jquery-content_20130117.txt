[01:43:49] <gnarf> ajpiano: i think our feedback loop is gonna die now ;)
[01:44:25] <ajpiano> yeah, i'm about to go to sleep here too
[01:47:42] <dean[h]> Morning. Just tried to push my plugin to the new site. How long should it take to appear? Any way to debug if it didn't work?
[01:48:56] <gnarf> dean[h]: which repo?
[01:49:48] <gnarf> ajpiano: sleep man
[01:49:56] <dean[h]> https://github.com/deanc/jquery-timepicker Damn I have to run, i'll read your message when im back though :)
[01:50:06] <gnarf> ajpiano: tag plugins to push docs maybe? (npm version)
[01:50:44] <gnarf> dean[h]: my guess is that you changed the 0.5.0 tag
[01:50:52] <jqcommit> 01[13plugins.jquery.com01] 15ajpiano pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/RfpVCg
[01:50:52] <jqcommit> 13plugins.jquery.com/06master 14df2f40f 15adam j. sontag: 1.0.4
[01:51:03] <gnarf> you should bump the version to 0.5.1 in the manifest and tag 0.5.1 
[01:51:10] <dean[h]> okay let me try realllly quickly :D
[01:51:55] <dean[h]> done...
[01:52:07] <gnarf> ajpiano: "We highly suggest that you **do not overwrite old tags**, instead, push a new version number to fix any errors you encounter." might need to work its way into the docs somewhere, of course, they don't really know they've encountered an error :)
[01:52:27] <ajpiano> yeah, i can see that
[01:52:33] <ajpiano> would be nice to see if we can avoid it
[01:53:07] <gnarf> dean[h]: Manifest errors: github/deanc/jquery-timepicker 0.5.1 jquery-timepicker.jquery.json [ 'Name must match manifest file name.' ]
[01:53:27] <gnarf> dean[h]: you should use timepicker.jquery.json / and "timepicker"
[01:53:52] <gnarf> (and 0.5.2) :)

[01:56:11] <gnarf> dean[h]: Jan 17 01:56:00 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[5899]: Added timepicker v0.5.2 to WordPress
[01:56:26] <ajpiano> gnarf: i just did one :p
[01:56:33] <ajpiano> https://github.com/chakrit/jquery-xpubsub/commit/d9b356052ed77ba4a4ae9d8940dbbb63a7b09123#commitcomment-2451040
[01:56:41] <ajpiano> gnarf: i think we'll want to recommend just doing like
[01:56:41] <gnarf> ajpiano: oh heh. i was doing it too :)
[01:56:52] <ajpiano> using grunt-cli to init jquery plugins
[01:56:57] <ajpiano> so that people screw up less
[01:57:00] <gnarf> ajpiano: i think it breaks :)
[01:57:04] <ajpiano> and using npm patch
[01:57:10] <ajpiano> version patch
[01:57:12] <ajpiano> to bump
[01:57:17] <ajpiano> like as a recommended workflow
[01:57:23] <gnarf> yeah
[01:57:29] <ajpiano> but for now, bedtime
[01:57:33] <gnarf> npm version patch wont work
[01:57:37] <ajpiano> ohhh
[01:57:39] <gnarf> cuz it needs to update manifest too
[01:57:41] <ajpiano> cause we need to update a diff file
[01:58:05] <ajpiano> it would be easy to add a grunt task that bumps the jquery version etcetc
[01:58:07] <gnarf> ajpiano: that person got a double dose of help :)
[01:58:10] <ajpiano> as part of the jquery init template
[01:58:20] <gnarf> yeah
[01:58:23] <gnarf> ajpiano: grunt manifest
[01:58:25] <ajpiano> lol we did it simultaneously
[01:58:30] <gnarf> the task is all over
[01:58:35] <ajpiano> yeah the verifier piece
[01:58:43] <ajpiano> etc
[01:58:45] <ajpiano> ok im so sleepy
[01:58:47] <ajpiano> so much to do
[01:58:57] <ajpiano> we'll catch up in the morning i guess
[01:59:05] <gnarf> you caught the licenses :)
[01:59:10] <gnarf> ajpiano: yeah
[01:59:17] <ajpiano> dean[h]: http://plugins.jquery.com/timepicker/
[02:10:27] <gnarf> agcolom: yt?
[02:29:01] <gnarf> oops - i think i messed up with the jquery-Modal guy
[02:29:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://plugins.jquery.com/jQuery-Modal/ -- but then i had him change name/whatever to just "modal" because it didn't seem to catch the 1.0.0 tag on the first pass
[02:29:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: now im not sure what to do about it :)
[02:31:01] <gnarf> im gonna stop with this pre-emptive posting stuff
[02:31:03] <gnarf> :)
[02:41:03] <coop182> Hey guys, I'm having trouble getting https://github.com/coop182/jquery.dfp.js on to the site... where did I mess up?

[03:03:50] <locks> hi, I just pushed a plugin to the new site
[03:04:12] <locks> are they screened before being published? just wondering how long 'till it shows up, and if I get a warning in case it fails
[03:13:50] <dean[h]> Hi ajpiano: http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=timepicker
[03:13:51] <dean[h]> no results
[03:21:13] <dean[h]> http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=time+picker returns results
[03:21:28] <dean[h]> Does the search not use the keywords?
[03:46:52] <dean[h]> Also is there a queue? I published another plugin and it's not showing up
[03:47:09] <dean[h]> although direct url is: http://plugins.jquery.com/carousel/
[03:50:32] <locks> that's showing up
[03:50:37] <locks> it's right there in the homepage
[03:53:57] <dean[h]> It's not in the search
[03:54:25] <dean[h]> The carousel plugin is in the search, but a search for "timepicker" returns nothing
[04:09:39] <zenorocha> hey guys, I did on the steps for publishing my plugin on the new repository, but it's not here =/
[04:10:03] <locks> zenorocha: same, no answer still :P
[04:10:19] <henrique> zenorocha, same here
[04:10:25] <zenorocha> =/
[04:11:57] <henrique> maybe isn't instant publishing. They should have some kind of validation before publish the new added plugins
[04:18:07] <accurs> Hi, I can't get my plugin https://github.com/accursoft/caret to show up on plugins.jquery.com
[04:18:22] <accurs> Does anyone have an idea what's wrong?
[04:18:47] <locks> accurs: we're 4 in here already
[04:37:10] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: If people want to be silly and put jQuery in their name, that's up to them.
[04:38:44] <scott_gonzalez> zenorocha locks henrique: Tell me which plugins you tried to publish.
[04:38:53] <locks> scott_gonzalez: rainbow
[04:39:05] <locks> https://github.com/locks/rainbow
[04:39:06] <zenorocha> "jQuery Github"
[04:39:07] <scott_gonzalez> (and give me a few minutes to wake up :-)
[04:39:17] <zenorocha> https://github.com/zenorocha/jquery-github-repos
[04:39:34] <locks> scott_gonzalez: so, the plugins are screened?
[04:39:39] <scott_gonzalez> no
[04:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> But you probably have a bad manifest.
[04:39:50] <scott_gonzalez> And there's no feedback loop right now.
[04:39:55] <locks> oh i see
[04:39:58] <locks> I thought it might be that
[04:42:41] <ghusse_> hi
[04:43:21] <ghusse_> I need some help with plugin.jquery.com, I tried to publish my plugin, but obviously, it does not work
[04:43:24] <zenorocha> but what is wrong on my manifest?

[04:45:03] <ghusse_> ok, great, thx

[04:46:06] <zenorocha> scott_gonzalez: what's is wrong with mine? https://github.com/zenorocha/jquery-github-repos
[04:46:45] <ghusse_> can you take a look at mine? https://github.com/ghusse/jQRangeSlider thx
[04:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> zenorocha: v.0.2.3 isn't valid.
[04:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> zenorocha: Remove the dot before the version number.
[04:47:01] <zenorocha> dammit =/
[04:47:03] <henrique> scott_gonzalez, and mine https://github.com/kidh0/jquery.idle ?
[04:47:03] <zenorocha> sorry
[04:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> zenorocha: No problem.
[04:48:08] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: No manifest files.
[04:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: You need to have the manifest file in a tag.
[04:49:34] <ghusse_> scott_gonzales: in a tag, defined where?
[04:49:42] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: In the root.
[04:49:51] <scott_gonzalez> You have it in the right place, but you haven't tagged since you added it.
[04:50:06] <scott_gonzalez> henrique: Your filename must match your plugin name.
[04:50:14] <ghusse_> Ok, i need to tag another version and it'll work
[04:50:16] <scott_gonzalez> You have a name of "idle" but a filename of jquery.idle.
[04:50:43] <zenorocha> scott_gonzalez: fixed, what about now? https://github.com/zenorocha/jquery-github-repos/tags
[04:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: Assuming your manifest is valid (it looks like it is).
[04:51:02] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: Change people to maintainers.
[04:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> There is no people field.
[04:51:19] <ghusse_> scott_gonzales: ok, thx
[04:52:18] <zenorocha> \o/
[04:52:20] <zenorocha> it's there!
[04:52:36] <scott_gonzalez> zenorocha: :-)
[04:53:21] <scott_gonzalez> Did I miss anyone?
[04:53:36] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, we'll be working on a notification system.
[04:53:49] <ghusse_> scott_gonzales: can you tell if old tags will be added as versions, or only future tags?
[04:54:01] <henrique> scott_gonzalez, fixed, but still not there
[04:54:01] <scott_gonzalez> Likely starting with an email, but hopefully we can improve it to comment directly in GitHub.
[04:54:08] <henrique> scott_gonzalez, any other problem?
[04:54:09] <accurs> scott: what does No valid releases mean?
[04:54:13] <locks> scott_gonzalez: the site should really have a disclaimer, so people know there's no feedback
[04:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: Any tag that is a semver name and has a valid manifest will be added, regardless of date.
[04:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: See jQuery UI which has had valid manifest files since 1.9.0.
[04:54:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://plugins.jquery.com/ui.core/
[04:55:27] <locks> scott_gonzalez: can you recheck mine?
[04:56:33] <scott_gonzalez> accurs: It means it couldn't find tags with semvers with valid manifests, but not because of a specific error in the manfiest file.
[04:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> So for instance, having invalid JSON.
[04:56:51] <scott_gonzalez> It's basically a catch-all for things we're not logging yet :-/
[04:56:58] <scott_gonzalez> locks: It does
[04:57:09] <scott_gonzalez> http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/
[04:57:24] <locks> oh right
[04:57:48] <locks> nvm me
[04:57:56] <scott_gonzalez> henrique: You haven't tagged yet.
[04:57:58] <locks> I'm here in the chan because of that x_x
[05:00:20] <scott_gonzalez> accurs: You have no tags.
[05:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> accurs: Did you delete them?
[05:01:01] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez: does it work if I push (override) an existing tag?
[05:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: no
[05:01:22] <scott_gonzalez> Tags are processed once and tracked by name.
[05:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: You have 3 options.
[05:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> 1) Add or remove the "v" prefix for the tag and use the same version number.
[05:02:26] <accurs> scott_gonzalez: just recreated it
[05:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> 2) Add a build number to your version, e.g. 1.2.3-1
[05:02:35] <scott_gonzalez> 3) Bump your version number.
[05:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> accurs: As I just mentioned to ghusse_ the site will not re-process a tag.
[05:03:16] <accurs> scott_gonzalez: even it failed the first time?
[05:03:28] <ghusse_> scott_gonzales: It's one shot then. If it does not work for another reason, I'll have to increment again until it works
[05:03:30] <scott_gonzalez> accurs: Yup
[05:03:35] <accurs> scott_gonzalez: that should probably be considered a bug
[05:03:55] <scott_gonzalez> accurs: No, retagging should be considered extremely harmful.
[05:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> We already support one retry with the v prefix.
[05:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> What you really want is a validation service.
[05:05:27] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/68
[05:06:07] <locks> scott_gonzalez: a local task would be much welcome
[05:06:29] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez: I updated the manifest and pushed a tag
[05:06:37] <ghusse_> how long does it take to appear?
[05:07:03] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: Almost instant, it's as fast as the GitHub post-receive hook.
[05:07:23] <scott_gonzalez> So far I'm only seeing logs for commits without tags.
[05:07:50] <scott_gonzalez> Or possibly retags, we don't check for retags, so there's no difference in logging.
[05:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: I see 4.2.9 in GitHub, must just be taking a while for GitHub to notify us.
[05:08:36] <ghusse_> scott_gonzales tag 4.2.9 appears on github
[05:08:46] <ghusse_> ok, thx
[05:09:34] <scott_gonzalez> Strange, still not seeing anything.
[05:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> 4.2.9 wasn't tagged earlier, right?
[05:10:12] <zenorocha> scott_gonzalez: scott, what's wrong with this one? https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/boilerplate/
[05:10:25] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: Try pressing the test hook button.
[05:11:11] <scott_gonzalez> zenorocha: Nothing. It just posted :-)
[05:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub seems a bit delayed right now.
[05:11:30] <zenorocha> oh ok =]
[05:11:34] <zenorocha> thanks again!
[05:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> It didn't show up in logs until 2 seconds before I sent that message.
[05:11:45] <zenorocha> let's go to the 3rd plugin
[05:12:07] <zenorocha> it's there

[05:12:29] <locks> argh, GitHub.app doesn't push tags
[05:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> locks: :-/
[05:16:23] <ghusse_> scott_gonzales: I pushed the test hook button. It's the first time I push this tag.
[05:16:51] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: added
[05:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: hmm...well, halfway added :-/
[05:17:35] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez; cant see it
[05:18:37] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez: halfway ? :)
[05:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: One of our processes crashed and the manager didn't restore it.
[05:19:41] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez: ok, it's all yours now :-]
[05:19:58] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez: tell me if I can do anything
[05:21:02] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: I can tell you that v4.2.9 was valid.
[05:21:29] <scott_gonzalez> It was added to the registry, but the process that updates the site is dead.
[05:21:30] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez: great, thx
[05:21:42] <scott_gonzalez> And nothing is bringing it up :-/
[05:21:50] <scott_gonzalez> Let me add some more logging and deploy.
[05:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: wordpress-update is dead and won't come back at all. I sent SIGHUP and everything restarted, but no logs from wordpress-retry.
[05:22:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I also did a full stop/start via init.d and it didn't come up.

[05:27:10] <dwradcliffe> how long should it take for a new plugin to show up?
[05:27:15] <dean[h]> There definitely appears to be some lag between pushing the tag and it appearing on the site
[05:27:20] <henrique> scott_gonzalez, I pushed that tag 1.1.0, but still isn't live
[05:27:28] <henrique> *the tag
[05:27:30] <dean[h]> I've just pushed my tag and it's not live yet
[05:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> There's been a lag for GitHub to notify us.
[05:27:40] <scott_gonzalez> But there's a dead process right now, so the site is not updating.
[05:28:05] <dean[h]> There appears to be some autocompleting in the url too. http://plugins.jquery.com/slider/ redirects to http://plugins.jquery.com/sliderbutton/ :(
[05:28:43] <dean[h]> If there's a dead process, will we have to do some process to push the plugin to the site again scott_gonzalez?
[05:29:04] <scott_gonzalez> dean[h]: No, when the process comes back up, the site will update.
[05:29:12] <scott_gonzalez> The post-receive hook listener is still running.
[05:29:22] <scott_gonzalez> dean[h]: Which repo?
[05:29:30] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nevermine.
[05:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> I know which one :-)
[05:29:37] <scott_gonzalez> It was successful.
[05:29:38] <dean[h]> the slider one
[05:29:44] <scott_gonzalez> Jan 17 05:25:32 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[9641]: Added slider v0.5.0 to plugins DB
[05:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> It made it to the canonical data source.
[05:30:02] <locks> scott_gonzalez: did rainbow show up?
[05:30:29] <scott_gonzalez> locks: yup :-)
[05:30:30] <dean[h]> It'd be really nice if there was some kind of twitter feed that output that stuff scott so we could see if we have things set up correctly
[05:30:30] <scott_gonzalez> Jan 17 05:15:00 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[5898]: Added rainbow v1.0.1 to plugins DB
[05:30:39] <locks> yay ^_^
[05:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> dean[h]: We're working on it.
[05:30:54] <dean[h]> Thanks. And you guys did a great job :)
[05:31:10] <dean[h]> I'm so so happy the plugin site is back online. The whole ecosystem was so fragmented in its absence
[05:31:44] <accurs> scott_gonzalez: I've tried submitting caret again. Is anything showing up in the logs?
[05:31:48] <scott_gonzalez> dean[h]: Filed an issue specifically for a Twitter feed: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/82
[05:32:06] <scott_gonzalez> dean[h]: But https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/11 will be more useful for the person doing the release.
[05:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> dean[h]: Thanks. Hopefully we can get this site update issue resolved soon.
[05:32:33] <dean[h]> Yep #11 would be great too. Definitely some user feedback is needed
[05:32:42] <dean[h]> But generally, apart from the lag the process has gone quite smoothly
[05:33:08] <locks> yeah, if there was a "simulation" task that would be aces
[05:33:24] <scott_gonzalez> accurs: There's no manifest file: https://github.com/accursoft/caret/tree/v1.0.0
[05:33:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, a verification task in the works: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/68
[05:34:36] <dean[h]> Maybe a link to jsonlint in the docs would be a start
[05:35:32] <dean[h]> What's going on with the sliderbutton redirect scott_gonzalez?
[05:35:52] <dean[h]> Is that some server-side thing?
[05:36:02] <scott_gonzalez> dean[h]: Yeah, it's default WordPress behavior.
[05:36:08] <scott_gonzalez> Autocomplete on 404.
[05:36:16] <dean[h]> aha
[05:36:19] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably disable that for the plugins site.
[05:36:31] <dean[h]> Okay one more question
[05:36:35] <henrique> scott_gonzalez, I already push the right tag (1.1.0) and still not published https://github.com/kidh0/jquery.idle/tree/1.1.0
[05:36:35] <dwradcliffe> yeah, seems like it would better to disable it
[05:36:45] <dean[h]> http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=timepicker why does this not show my plugin which has one of the keywords set as "timepicker"
[05:37:03] <scott_gonzalez> dean[h]: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/179
[05:37:57] <scott_gonzalez> dean[h]: Not sure why that's the deafult search implementation. Filed: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/180
[05:38:30] <scott_gonzalez> henrique: I told you the name doesn't match the file name.
[05:38:52] <scott_gonzalez> The filename needs to be idle.jquery.json or your name needs to be jquery.idle.
[05:39:29] <dean[h]> There seems to be quite a lot of confusion regarding the namespacing ;)
[05:39:43] <dean[h]> It's nice you are encouraging users to drop the jQuery prefix though. It is redundant here
[05:40:08] <dwradcliffe> have you seen normalizePhoneNumber go through yet?
[05:40:42] <scott_gonzalez> dwradcliffe: Invalid characters for keywords
[05:41:11] <scott_gonzalez> dwradcliffe: No spaces allowed.
[05:41:16] <dwradcliffe> ah, thanks!
[05:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[05:41:42] <henrique> scott_gonzalez, sorry about that, I fix in the master branch but not in the tag
[05:41:48] <henrique> scott_gonzalez, fixing now
[05:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> henrique: ok :-)
[05:42:38] <accurs> scott_gonzalez: thanks, i've tried again. caret still not showing up
[05:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> accurs: Nothing is going to show up right now. The WordPress update process is dead.
[05:44:29] <scott_gonzalez> accurs: Jan 17 05:39:04 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[9641]: Added caret v1.0.1 to plugins DB
[05:44:48] <accurs> scott_gonzalez: great! thanks for all your help!
[05:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> When I can figure out why this process is crashing, it'll be up.
[05:45:44] <henrique> scott_gonzalez, fix the filename in the tag 1.1.0
[05:45:48] <henrique> *fixed
[05:46:04] <dwradcliffe> would an official github service be nice? (instead of having to c/p the webhoook url)
[05:47:39] <Iluvatar> scott_gonzalez: hi, some news about the bug in my plugin (you remember tiSlideshow) ?
[05:47:47] * locks goes sip some tea waiting for his plugin to show up
[05:48:08] <scott_gonzalez> dwradcliffe: What do you mean?
[05:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> henrique: You can't retag with the same name.
[05:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> It'll just be ignored.
[05:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> You can use v1.0.0 if you want.
[05:49:36] <henrique> scott_gonzalez, hum, ok, I'll retag it with a diferent name
[05:49:54] <scott_gonzalez> Iluvatar: What bug? Your plugin is on the site.
[05:50:42] <dwradcliffe> scott_gonzales: so it would show up under "AVAILABLE SERVICE HOOKS" with a checkbox to activate
[05:51:05] <henrique> scott_gonzalez, retag, now with tag 1.1.1
[05:51:24] <scott_gonzalez> dwradcliffe: Oh, that's a good idea.
[05:51:35] <Iluvatar> Well, I cannot find it (searched with the global search, and searched under slider, but nothing)
[05:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> Want to file an issue for that? http://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues
[05:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> Iluvatar: Are you slider or slideshow?
[05:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'm confused since you just said "(you remember tiSlideshow) ?"
[05:52:33] <Iluvatar> I try to publish this one https://github.com/Tillid/tiSlideshow
[05:52:45] <Iluvatar> I was here about 8 hours ago
[05:53:07] <ghusse_> scott_gonzales: how do you extract tags on plugins pages?
[05:53:55] <Iluvatar> I left, and now I want to know if you resolve the bug that prevent me publishing the plugin
[05:55:22] <Iluvatar> (maybe not a bug, it should be my fault, but do you find the problem ?)
[05:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> Iluvatar: Hmm..I'm not seeing this in our logs.
[05:56:03] <scott_gonzalez> Probably log rotation.
[05:56:13] <Iluvatar> Ok, I try to publish a new version, you will tell me
[05:56:23] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: `git tag`
[05:56:36] <scott_gonzalez> Iluvatar: Ok, I'm watching the logs right now.
[05:56:46] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: We clone the repo and check for new tags.
[05:57:28] <ghusse_> not these tags, I'm meaning tags in the description o plugins. Such as "boilerplate", "date", "slider", or anythings
[05:57:46] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez: terms about the plugin
[05:57:57] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: Oh, it's the keywords from the manifest.
[05:58:17] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez: ok
[05:58:26] <dwradcliffe> scott_gonzalez: the tag is in the webhook payload, isn't it?
[05:58:43] <dwradcliffe> (git tag)
[05:59:01] <scott_gonzalez> dwradcliffe: We actually ignore 90% of the payload.
[05:59:16] <scott_gonzalez> It's more fault tolerant to search for tags on our own.
[05:59:27] <dwradcliffe> that makes sense
[05:59:31] <scott_gonzalez> That way if GitHub is busted or our process dies, we can catch up later.
[05:59:33] <Iluvatar> Ok, tag 1.0.2 is out for tiSlideshow
[05:59:50] <scott_gonzalez> Iluvatar: Jan 17 05:58:53 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[19541]: Added tislideshow v1.0.1 to plugins DB
[05:59:58] <dwradcliffe> so you just store a queue of repos to process
[05:59:58] <scott_gonzalez> Once I can fix this other process, it'll show up on the site.
[06:00:11] <scott_gonzalez> dwradcliffe: They're processed in real time.
[06:00:26] <scott_gonzalez> We process everything in parallel as it comes in.
[06:00:55] <scott_gonzalez> There's actually no queueing logic.
[06:01:03] <dwradcliffe> ok
[06:01:16] <scott_gonzalez> But the fault tolerance comes in from not actually caring about the post-receive hook being for the tag.
[06:01:20] <Iluvatar> By the way we have to create the tag before the push ? Or the hook works when we just push the new tag ?
[06:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you can't push a tag if you haven't tagged yet. So I don't think I understand your question.
[06:02:05] <scott_gonzalez> The hook will notify us of every single push you do.
[06:02:05] <Iluvatar> That's what I thought too
[06:02:46] <Iluvatar> but you juste receive the version 1.0.1 of my plugin, and I was trying to publish the 1.0.2
[06:04:28] <Iluvatar> well, thanks a lot for your help, I hope you will solve the problem soon =)

[06:11:23] <dean[h]> How is the process inspection going scott :)?
[06:12:59] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I think I just learned that logging inside uncaughtException isn't too useful.
[06:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking the logging doesn't happen fast enough.
[06:13:34] <scott_gonzalez> But I did just get stack trace by running the process on its own with a flag to log to console instead of syslog.
[06:13:40] <scott_gonzalez> So that should help.
[06:14:08] <scott_gonzalez> AHA
[06:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> The code assumes all plugins have keywords.
[06:14:50] <scott_gonzalez> I should be able to have a fix deployed in a few minutes.
[06:15:11] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez: ooops, it seems I made it crash then :p
[06:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: haha
[06:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> Well, thanks for finding a bug :-)
[06:15:54] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez: you're welcome
[06:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> Also, now I can just use your repo to test locally.
[06:16:39] <ghusse_> i'll add keywords in next release
[06:17:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, step 1 complete: Reproduced the error locally.
[06:18:11] <scott_gonzalez> Step 2 complete: Posted your plugin locally.
[06:19:13] <scott_gonzalez> HERE WE GO!

[06:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> So many plugins just got posted.
[06:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> ghusse_: http://plugins.jquery.com/jQRangeSlider/
[06:19:58] <dean[h]> I don't see them on the homepage yet scott_gonzalez
[06:20:00] <dean[h]> cache?
[06:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, probably. nginx caches for a few seconds.
[06:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise our servers melt.
[06:20:33] <ghusse_> scott_gonzalez: great! thx
[06:20:35] <dean[h]> The timestamps on the homepage are also wrong. It says my carousel plugin was posted 9hrs ago. I've barely been awake that long ;)
[06:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> We got a TON of traffic, especially from api.jquery.com.
[06:20:53] <scott_gonzalez> dean[h]: Yeah, it's off by 8 hours.
[06:20:59] <scott_gonzalez> We've got an issue filed for it already.
[06:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> Holy crap, now I need to remove a bunch of the logging I added.
[06:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> I love this deployment process.

[06:47:38] <dwradcliffe> nice work scott_gonzalez
[06:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks dwradcliffe.
[06:48:17] <dwradcliffe> I'm curious what your deployment process is
[06:48:38] <scott_gonzalez> You want the technical details or the steps I have to take?
[06:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> The process for deploying: 1) push a tag. 2) DONE
[06:49:56] <dwradcliffe> technical details
[06:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> We have a module that listens for post-receive hooks: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-notifier
[06:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> And a script that executes other scripts based on rules: https://github.com/gnarf37/node-notifier-server/tree/master/notifier.d
[06:51:37] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery-wp-content01] 15rdworth tagged 062.0.10 at 06master: 02http://git.io/WjfQDA
[06:51:45] <scott_gonzalez> Most sites use grunt: https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt
[06:52:05] <scott_gonzalez> With a `grunt deploy` task that uses grunt-wordpress to sync the content: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-wordpress/
[06:52:22] <scott_gonzalez> Which uses node-wordpress to communicate via XML-RPC: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-wordpress/
[06:52:56] <scott_gonzalez> The plugins site actually has a manager script: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/scripts/manager.js
[06:53:21] <scott_gonzalez> Which launches three other processes (one to listen for post-receive hooks, one to update WordPress, and one to re-process failures)
[06:53:33] <scott_gonzalez> The manager watches the processes and relaunches them if they crash.
[06:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> It also listens for SIGHUP (sent on any new deployment) and restarts the child processes to load the new code.
[06:54:16] <dwradcliffe> nice
[06:54:25] <scott_gonzalez> Each child process has logic for a graceful shutdown so that it completes what it's doing and then exits cleanly when done.
[06:54:54] <scott_gonzalez> And things like the post-receive process which spawn a server will just keep trying to spawn the server if the port is busy.
[06:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> So we launch the new process and it just spins until the old process dies.
[06:55:19] <scott_gonzalez> That way we reduce the amount of time we're not listening during a restart.
[06:55:25] <zenorocha> How to publish a plugin in jQuery Plugin Registry > https://github.com/jquery-boilerplate/boilerplate/wiki/How-to-publish-a-plugin-in-jQuery-Plugin-Registry
[06:55:25] <dwradcliffe> that's great
[06:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> All logs are written with https://github.com/jquery/node-logger
[06:56:09] <scott_gonzalez> Which logs to syslog by deafult, but logs to the conole if you spawn the process with --console.
[06:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> So it's easy to debug locally.

[07:22:52] <scott_gonzalez> So, it's kind of nice to be developing a product again, like the plugins site. But it's not so nice doing that while swamped with framework development :-P
[07:26:04] <kswedberg> ajpiano: thanks! I don't think it's done, but it's a start, at least. 
[07:27:07] <henrique> hey scott_gonzalez , I just want to thank you for your patience, my plugin is published :)
[07:27:32] <scott_gonzalez> henrique: :-)
[07:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry for the lack of automated feedback and validation sevice.
[07:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> s/sevice/service/
[07:28:05] <scott_gonzalez> We'll get those in place soon.
[07:31:52] <kswedberg> ajpiano: I started getting a little confused about how much to put in documentation.md vs linking to other places, like various contributing.md files, the learning site's style guide, etc. seems we're proliferating info in multiple locations, and I don't have a sense of the overcall goals/strategy. 
[07:34:06] <henrique> scott_gonzalez, guess that this feedback service will make your life much easier
[07:34:23] <scott_gonzalez> henrique: indeed
[07:34:33] <scott_gonzalez> Especially when I'm in the middle of another release, like right now :-P

[08:00:47] <JohnResig> heya!
[08:00:54] <scott_gonzalez> Hey JohnResig!
[08:01:10] <scott_gonzalez> dwradcliffe: That is awesome.
[08:01:18] <JohnResig> Quick question: I published a plugin to the plugins site but it's not showing up -- perhaps there is a delay?
[08:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> dwradcliffe: Do you know how fast they usually accept those?
[08:01:39] <js-coder> Hey guys, I just added <name>.jquery.json to my GitHub repo and added the webhook before, how long will it take until it shows up on the plugin site? :)
[08:01:42] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: Let me check the logs.
[08:01:54] <JohnResig> my repo + json file in question: https://github.com/jeresig/jquery.hotkeys/blob/master/hotkeys.jquery.json
[08:02:26] <js-coder> JohnResig: I was just writing the same question when you hit enter
[08:02:30] <JohnResig> js-coder: ha! :)
[08:02:55] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...for some reason it said there were no tags to process.
[08:03:23] <JohnResig> I was reading on Hacker News that you don't get webhook notifications when there is a tag push
[08:03:45] <JohnResig> the top comment here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5071597
[08:03:47] <JohnResig> I wonder if that's it
[08:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> Really? Because we use tags for our site deployments.
[08:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> I know they send them.
[08:04:16] <js-coder> I added the file using the GitHub UI, so maybe that doesn't trigger the webhook either
[08:04:21] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-git-notifier/blob/master/notifier.js#L61
[08:04:42] <scott_gonzalez> Try pressing the test hook button.
[08:05:06] <JohnResig> k
[08:05:32] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: done
[08:05:38] <scott_gonzalez> added
[08:05:54] <Guest24816> submitted plugin osk about half an hour ago or more, still not showing up. any idea why?
[08:06:00] <dwradcliffe> We use a webhook with hubot to announce new tags internally, so I'm 99% sure it does send
[08:06:00] <scott_gonzalez> So, all of our sites are deployed on tag.
[08:06:12] <scott_gonzalez> And they work properly.
[08:06:28] <scott_gonzalez> So I wonder what's going on?
[08:06:38] <Guest24816> https://github.com/accursoft/osk/tree/v1.0.1
[08:06:47] <JohnResig> Are you doing a commit when you do the tag?
[08:06:47] <scott_gonzalez> I know GitHub sends tag notifications, but maybe they don't send them until the next commit?
[08:07:08] <scott_gonzalez> Usually, but not always.
[08:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> Though I generally `git push && git push --tags`
[08:08:10] <dwradcliffe> even with that, the commit push wouldn't have the tags. the next push would have the tags and show it in the payload
[08:08:33] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: I wonder if it would make sense to ask people to do the tag and THEN commit then manifest
[08:08:52] <scott_gonzalez> The manifest needs to be in the tag.
[08:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> We look at the file inside the tag, not in master.
[08:09:04] <JohnResig> I should note that I did two separate pushes as well, perhaps that's the issue?
[08:09:18] <JohnResig> one push for the manifest, and then the push for the tag
[08:09:31] <scott_gonzalez> That should be fine.
[08:09:36] <dwradcliffe> worked for me
[08:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> I saw two entries in the logs (one for each push)
[08:09:53] <JohnResig> huh

[08:10:23] <JohnResig> weird!
[08:10:29] <scott_gonzalez> And then a third from your test.
[08:10:35] <JohnResig> yeah, I think that's the issue that guy was talking about
[08:11:39] <JohnResig> tangential note: it looks like the timezones are messed up - it says I released the plugin 8 hours ago (I assume it's a GMT vs. PST thing)
[08:12:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, we've got an issue filed for that.
[08:12:31] <JohnResig> k
[08:14:45] <Guest24816> scott_gonzalez: do you have anything in the logs for osk?
[08:14:56] <js-coder> My .jquery.json file is inside the v1.1.0 tag, and yet it doesn't show up on the plugins site. https://github.com/js-coder/jQuery.x18n/tree/v1.1.0 Did I do anything wrong or am I just too impatient?
[08:15:09] <scott_gonzalez> Manifest errors: github/accursoft/osk v1.0.1 osk.jquery.json [ 'Invalid version range for dependency: caret.' ]
[08:15:41] <scott_gonzalez> Guest24816: That's a bug in our code.
[08:15:54] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have support for "*".
[08:16:03] <Guest24816> the docs mention * as matching any version
[08:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> node-semver can't expand it to an actual range.
[08:16:17] <scott_gonzalez> It was an oversight.
[08:16:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I need to fix that.
[08:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> Guest24816: Can you leave a comment on https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/78 with the repo and tag that incorrectly failed?
[08:17:57] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, issue #78 by scottgonzalez (9h 49m ago): "*" dependency range doesn't work
[08:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> That way you'll get notified when we fix this and we can go in and mark that tag for a retry.
[08:20:10] <Guest24816> done
[08:21:44] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, I'll try to get to that today.
[08:21:53] <scott_gonzalez> Gotta finish this UI release first :-)
[08:22:08] <Guest24816> changed it to >1, still not working ...
[08:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> Did you change the tag name/version number?
[08:22:44] <Guest24816> dropped the v
[08:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> Try pressing the test hook button.
[08:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> that worked
[08:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: This is strange. I'll need to figure out why our deploy process works flawlessly but the plugins update doesn't.
[08:24:36] <Guest24816> not in the list, or does that take time?
[08:24:39] <scott_gonzalez> The odd thing is the deploy process actually listens for GitHub notification specific to tags.
[08:24:44] <JohnResig> scott_gonzalez: huh, ok! I wonder how many people have had a similar issue to me
[08:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> And the plugins site doesn't care, it just listens for any update and then checks git directly for new tags.
[08:25:19] <scott_gonzalez> Guest24816: http://plugins.jquery.com/osk/
[08:25:31] <scott_gonzalez> It just takes a few seconds because we have nginx caching everything.
[08:25:54] <Guest24816> just came up on the front page. i guess there's some delay
[08:26:02] <Guest24816> thanks for all your help!
[08:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> no problem

[08:55:40] <ryanneufeld> plugins looks great guys
[09:03:41] <scott_gonzalez> ryanneufeld: :-)
[09:05:44] <js-coder> scott_gonzalez: Do you have anything in the logs for jQuery.x18n?
[09:06:29] <scott_gonzalez> js-coder: No manfiest file for 1.0.0 or 1.1.0.
[09:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..but you do have a manifest file.
[09:07:14] <js-coder> Exactly. https://github.com/js-coder/jQuery.x18n/blob/v1.1.0/x18n.jquery.json
[09:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> Did you change your code and re-tag?
[09:07:22] <scott_gonzalez> Because the site won't pick that up if you did.
[09:07:24] <js-coder> Yeah, I re-tagged once
[09:07:39] <scott_gonzalez> It only processes a tag once, based on name.
[09:08:08] <js-coder> Oh. So I'll have to create v1.1.1 right? :/
[09:08:19] <scott_gonzalez> You have 3 options.
[09:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> Tag 1.1.0 (without the v prefix), add a build numbe (v1.1.0-1) or bump the version number.
[09:08:59] <js-coder> I'll go for the build number!
[09:12:31] <js-coder> scott_gonzalez: I pushed v1.1.0-1, and it didn't show up on the plugins site yet. Anything new in the logs?
[09:12:47] <js-coder> Or is there just a delay when registering new plugins?
[09:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> We're having an issue, supposedly GitHub doesn't send notifications for tags when the tag is pushed.
[09:14:06] <scott_gonzalez> Try pressing the test hook button.
[09:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> To trigger the notification.
[09:14:56] <js-coder> Done.
[09:15:29] <JohnResig> another person with an issue: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5073700
[09:19:46] <js-coder> scott_gonzalez: Anything new in the log?
[09:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> js-coder: Manifest errors: github/js-coder/jQuery.x18n v1.1.0-1 x18n.jquery.json [ 'Name must match manifest file name.',   'Manifest version (1.1.0) does not match tag (v1.1.0-1).' ]
[09:21:18] <bluetidepro> Hey everyone, I'm trying to publish my plugin to the new plugins area. I did the hook, and the manifest, but I don't get how to do "Publishing a Version"?
[09:21:30] <bluetidepro> Is that something I can do from GitHub on my repo or what?
[09:22:08] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: That person has an invalid manifest.
[09:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: Can you tell him that this is the error: Manifest errors: github/jbrooksuk/jQueryLocalStorage 1.0.2 localstorage.jquery.json [ 'Name must match manifest file name.',   'Manifest version (1.0.1) does not match tag (1.0.2).' ]
[09:23:51] <bluetidepro> I usually use the GitHub mac app, so I don't really understand the "Publishing a Version" documentation that says "as simple as tagging the version in git and pushing the tag to GitHub"
[09:23:52] <scott_gonzalez> I don't have a Hacker News account.
[09:24:23] <scott_gonzalez> bluetidepro: I've never used the GitHub app, so I couldn't tell you how to do it.
[09:24:42] <bluetidepro> How do I normally do that without the app?
[09:24:59] <ajpiano> apparnetly you can't tag from github for mac
[09:25:11] <ajpiano> bluetidepro: you just do "git tag v1.0.0"
[09:25:30] <ajpiano> and git push --tags
[09:25:45] <bluetidepro> like in terminal? (sorry if these are dumb questions, the whole git thing confuses me and isn't my normal specialty)
[09:25:51] <ajpiano> yep
[09:25:54] <scott_gonzalez> bluetidepro: We'll figure it out and document it. I created an issue: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/92
[09:25:55] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, issue #92 by scottgonzalez (5m 10s ago): Document how to tag using the GitHub mac app

[09:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Can you review this? https://github.com/dwradcliffe/github-services/blob/dbbe335710a82cdcf8eea6c80be9282ffe7fe949/docs/jquery_plugins
[09:26:35] <ajpiano> sure
[09:26:45] <scott_gonzalez> He created a GitHub service so that people don't even need to type in the URL.
[09:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> He wanted us to review the description before he sent a PR to GitHub.
[09:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: It's in response to https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/83
[09:27:11] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, issue #83 by dwradcliffe (3h 26m ago): Setup a GitHub service for the webook
[09:27:11] <ajpiano> ohhhh that's radddd
[09:27:28] <ajpiano> yeah wow guys i can't believe there has been so much action last night
[09:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's keeping me busy.
[09:27:55] <scott_gonzalez> Making this UI release go super slow :-P
[09:28:05] <ajpiano> i got here and i'm like, hmm this channel seems a lot more populated than it had been
[09:28:56] <ajpiano> love the hn thread
[09:29:15] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Can you reply to this? http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5073700
[09:29:26] <scott_gonzalez> Here's the error: Manifest errors: github/jbrooksuk/jQueryLocalStorage 1.0.2 localstorage.jquery.json [ 'Name must match manifest file name.',   'Manifest version (1.0.1) does not match tag (1.0.2).' ]
[09:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> Alternatively, I can comment in his repo.
[09:30:05] <ajpiano> yea i was just heading to his repo
[09:30:26] <ajpiano> can you cmment on the repo with the fix, i'll comment on hn that we're triaging broken submissions as best we can and working on better error reporting
[09:31:15] <ajpiano> this is the best section
[09:31:16] <ajpiano> http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5071751
[09:31:48] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: people just seem simply SHOCKED that it wasn't perfect to begin with
[09:32:12] <ajpiano> well, that we didn't already have a perfect version working already
[09:32:16] <ajpiano> several years ago
[09:32:58] <scott_gonzalez> meh
[09:33:13] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[09:33:22] <scott_gonzalez> wwalser is my friend at Atlassian.
[09:33:23] <ajpiano> yeah, what can you do
[09:33:26] <ajpiano> oh sweet
[09:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> We used to work together in NC.
[09:33:51] <ajpiano> people were asking about bitbucket integration a bit on twitter last night
[09:34:52] <scott_gonzalez> heh: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5071612
[09:35:09] <ajpiano> either way, i'm more excited about the fact that we're getting PRs and issues
[09:35:23] <ajpiano> hahah that guy tweeted a similar thing
[09:35:36] <ajpiano> the plugin site has always brought out a unique side of our users
[09:38:32] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: did you comment on jbrooksuk's repo yet?
[09:38:55] <js-coder> I finally managed to register my plugin :) This plugin site really needs some error system
[09:39:03] <ajpiano> js-coder: we know :)
[09:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Not yet, will do that now.
[09:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: done
[09:41:27] <ajpiano> link?
[09:41:44] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: told you we should have called it a beta :p
[09:43:17] <dwradcliffe> PR sent for GitHub service
[09:43:20] <jack> Are the post-receive hooks for the plugin site working properly?  My plugins aren't showing up after commits.
[09:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> But we already know people don't use betas :-P
[09:43:29] <ajpiano> heh
[09:43:36] <ajpiano> different if it's like a website
[09:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> jack: Which repo?
[09:43:56] <jack> https://github.com/jackmoore/autosize
[09:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> Manifest errors: github/jackmoore/autosize 1.15.3 autosize.jquery.json [ 'Manifest version (1.15.0) does not match tag (1.15.3).' ]
[09:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> Manifest errors: github/jackmoore/autosize 1.15.4 autosize.jquery.json [ 'Manifest version (1.15.3) does not match tag (1.15.4).' ]
[09:45:06] <jack> Thanks
[09:45:09] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[09:45:53] <jack> Where did you view those errors?
[09:48:26] <ajpiano> we have them on the server - we haev been manually supplying them to folks whose pushes haven't worked
[09:48:40] <ajpiano> we are working on a way to get the error reporting automated
[09:51:22] <scott_gonzalez>  I think dwradcliffe and I just figured out what the problem is with tags being missed.
[09:51:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's the parallel processing throttle that I added last night: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/commit/e6d4864cb8a33b0fa6dbfee39be96a1802dde2a0
[09:51:50] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, Scott González (18h 50m ago): Avoid processing the same repo twice at the same time.
[09:52:23] <scott_gonzalez> We were afraid the processing could enter a race condition and double up on adding a repo.
[09:52:31] <scott_gonzalez> We need to queue the later request instead of dropping it.
[09:54:12] <scott_gonzalez> JohnResig: ^
[09:59:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it doesn't print the log messge in there tho
[09:59:50] <gnarf> but yes, maybe "retry" could handle it
[09:59:51] <gnarf> ?
[10:00:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Hmmm...have we restarted the manager?
[10:00:20] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, I'm pretty sure I've restarted the manager since then.
[10:00:29] <scott_gonzalez> So that's not it.
[10:00:40] <scott_gonzalez> I thought for sure that would be it.
[10:00:42] <ajpiano> hey um
[10:00:46] <ajpiano> CONTENT MEETING TIME
[10:00:55] <ajpiano> :D
[10:01:12] <ajpiano> #jquery-meeting
[10:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's not eve in the manager.
[10:01:25] <scott_gonzalez> So this code is definitely running.
[10:01:37] <jack> scott, could you tell me why my most recent commit didn't work? https://github.com/jackmoore/autosize
[10:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> jack: Because you can't retag.
[10:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> We process tags once, and track by name.
[10:02:31] <jack> Ok
[10:02:40] <jack> Thanks
[10:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> Sorry about not having a way to test this yet.
[10:03:16] <agcolom> hi!
[10:04:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I'm more thinking that the git clone might need to be delayed by like half a minute
[10:04:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: our process detects tags in the payload
[10:04:52] <gnarf> which works
[10:05:17] <gnarf> but maybe we're receiving the payload before github has updated its fetch? 
[10:05:34] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: But then why wouldn't our deploys randonly fail?
[10:06:04] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: because we don't checkout via tag, we checkout via SHA
[10:06:07] <scott_gonzalez> There can't be much time difference between how quickly the plugins site pocesses the request and how quickly our sites get processed.
[10:06:22] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:06:41] <jack> Sorry scott, but could you tell me what when wrong that time?
[10:06:48] <scott_gonzalez> So you think we get the notification that the tag exists before the tag actually exists for fetching?
[10:06:58] <gnarf> jack autosize still?
[10:07:23] <gnarf> Manifest errors: github/jackmoore/autosize 1.16.0 autosize.jquery.json [ 'Manifest version (1.15.4) does not match tag (1.16.0).' ]
[10:07:23] <jack> yep
[10:07:33] <gnarf> youll need a 1.16.1 :)
[10:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> He tagged 1.16.1
[10:07:49] <gnarf> oh
[10:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> Try pressing the test hook button.
[10:08:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i was sending test.js requests at it
[10:08:11] <scott_gonzalez> This is the issue gnarf and I are discussing right now :-)
[10:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> jack: Added
[10:08:58] <gnarf> Jan 17 10:08:52 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[5418]: Added autosize v1.16.1 to WordPress
[10:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> Give nginx a few seconds to refresh the cche
[10:09:08] <scott_gonzalez> *cache
[10:09:25] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: nginx is the cause for the slight delay between the log and the site updating, right?
[10:09:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's a really short delay, so it's not an issue.
[10:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> I just want to make sure I'm diagnosing this correctly.
[10:10:00] <gnarf> yeah, up to 2 minutes it could be cached 
[10:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> http://plugins.jquery.com/autosize/
[10:11:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thats just my theory
[10:11:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: like we get the notification, then 15 seconds later the tag is there
[10:12:10] <gnarf> like i send a test.js request with their url, and it work
[10:41:37] <gnarf> ajpiano: I think I'm going to add a "how long should this take" to the submission page
[10:41:46] <ajpiano> seems like a good stopgap
[10:43:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you rang earlier this morning btw?
[10:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, when wordpress-update was totally dead.
[10:44:57] <scott_gonzalez> syslog for uncaughtExceptions is a no-go.
[10:45:17] <scott_gonzalez> Which made tracking down the issue a bit tricky.
[10:45:27] <scott_gonzalez> I ended up running the script directly with --console.
[10:45:45] <scott_gonzalez> Which gave me the strack trace.
[10:45:59] <scott_gonzalez> I guess the syslog module isn't implemented properly?
[10:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> I think the script is exiting too soon becuse syslog isn't blocking.
[10:46:21] <scott_gonzalez> Not that it should actually *block*.
[10:46:37] <scott_gonzalez> I can ping isaacs about it later.
[10:49:19] <gnarf> so quick content for the site for proofing:
[10:49:26] <gnarf> adding to the bottom of the 'tagging' section:
[10:49:27] <gnarf> We highly suggest that you **do not overwrite old tags**, instead, push a new version number tag (and commit to the manifest) to fix any errors you've encounterd.
[10:50:16] <gnarf> ## How long should the process take
[10:50:16] <gnarf> When everything works, this process is pretty close to instant.  There are caches in place, etc, but in general, if you haven't seen your plugin get updated on the site within 5 minutes, theres a good chance something went wrong.  Going into your Web Hooks settings and hitting the "Test Hook" button (once) may help if you recently pushed a new tag.
[10:50:20] <gnarf> new section
[10:50:57] <scott_gonzalez> seems good
[10:51:03] <ajpiano> +1
[10:51:11] <gnarf> Was thinking about adding like a quick checklist to having trouble?
[10:51:27] <ajpiano> we should just add the damn error reporting asap :p

[10:57:57] <LoonyPandora> Is there no way at all to find out why a plugin isn't getting published then? I've tried the "push, hope, and wait" approach, but nothing doing.
[10:58:47] <dwradcliffe> LoonyPandora: not yet. asking here is the best way
[10:59:15] <LoonyPandora> Bummer :(
[10:59:19] <ajpiano> hmm
[10:59:33] <ajpiano> LoonyPandora: Manifest errors: github/LoonyPandora/jQuery-WordClock 1.0.0 wordclock.jquery.json [ 'Name must match manifest file name.' ]
[10:59:35] <LoonyPandora> In that case, sorry to trouble you all, but could someone help me out with getting my plugin published: https://github.com/LoonyPandora/jQuery-WordClock
[10:59:48] <ajpiano> LoonyPandora: we're sitll working on error reporting and such, but we're doing our best to help out
[10:59:49] <ajpiano> :)
[11:00:47] <ajpiano> so LoonyPandora you're running into https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/73, basically
[11:00:49] <b-ot> ajpiano, issue #73 by scottgonzalez (15h 5m ago): All name matching should be case-insensitive
[11:01:14] <ajpiano> LoonyPandora: for now, the easiest thing to do is just chang the plugin name in the manifest to "wordclock", tag a new version, and push again
[11:01:17] <ajpiano> can you give that a shot>?
[11:03:59] <gnarf> LoonyPandora: and it's no trouble.  It's our own fault for not having any good feedback yet :)
[11:05:18] <LoonyPandora> ajpiano: just done that now, and it's worked! Thanks a lot. I feel a bit silly, because I did read the part about the "Name must match manifest file name" - but code blindness struck, and I overlooked it.
[11:06:13] <ajpiano> LoonyPandora: it's ok
[11:06:17] <ajpiano> quite welcome :)
[11:06:27] <LoonyPandora> gnarf: fielding all these support queries will be good motivation to get feedback implemented! good luck :)
[11:06:44] <gnarf> LoonyPandora: :) I get to play the part of an automation bot tho
[11:06:55] <gnarf> it's kinda fun adding comments to plugin repos :)
[11:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> LoonyPandora: If I wasn't doing a UI release right now, that's what I'd be working on ;-)
[11:11:20] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/pull/181 seems pretty sane, yeah?
[11:11:21] <b-ot> gnarf, pull request #181 by petersendidit (2h 27m ago): Don't wrap button in entry sumary
[11:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> If it looks good, land it. I just haven't had time to look at anything.

[15:04:32] <gnarf> ajpiano: ^^^
[15:05:05] <ajpiano> not sure
[15:05:10] <ajpiano> we're going to be adding another menu tom
[15:05:20] <jzaefferer> tom?

[15:06:00] <gnarf> ajpiano: where else tho?
[15:06:04] <ajpiano> i was wondering the same thing though gnarf
[15:06:11] <ajpiano> right
[15:06:17] <ajpiano> it seems to make sense
[15:06:22] <ajpiano> it's on the jquery.com main header
[15:06:23] <gnarf> pushing
[15:06:29] <ajpiano> so it's kind of always been "there"
[15:06:35] <ajpiano> so the question is whether it should really been in the top
[15:06:42] <ajpiano> which it is wehre it is on old jqeury.com
[15:07:05] <ajpiano> i think i type jquery enough times a day that it makes up for the fact that i use $ in my javascript
[15:07:10] <ajpiano> jussayin
[15:07:35] <gnarf> #js
[15:07:48] <gnarf> so push it?
[15:07:50] <gnarf> yes?
[15:08:04] <gnarf> until we find a better place for it
[15:08:06] <ajpiano> yeah
[15:08:08] <ajpiano> fine for now
[15:08:11] <ajpiano> it's definitely hidden right now

[17:12:56] <danheberden> i'm making room for 2.0
[17:13:01] <danheberden> so was mid-styling

[17:35:42] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Not sure what's up with that.
[17:35:53] <petersendidit> 1.8 seems to be working
[17:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> I thought 1.9 was working last night.
[17:36:25] <scott_gonzalez> But mostly things are a blur, so I can't be sure.

[17:46:14] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i do have a question for you though
[17:46:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well, maybe I can be helpful :-)
[17:46:33] <kborchers> i just blasted and started my local install over
[17:46:58] <kborchers> went through the install process on the jquery-wp-content repo
[17:47:17] <kborchers> everything seemed to go fine but now i see ERROR: The themes directory is either empty or doesn’t exist. Please check your installation. in the admin
[17:47:20] <kborchers> any idea?
[17:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> which site?
[17:48:05] <kborchers> jquery.com i guess since that's what was in the install instructions
[17:48:15] <kborchers> yeah
[17:48:18] <scott_gonzalez> Also, did you happen to look at any of the accordion demos last night?
[17:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> Try one of the other sites.
[17:48:48] <kborchers> ok, yeah it was just that site
[17:49:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's kinda ghetto right now.
[17:49:09] <scott_gonzalez> So don't worry about that.
[17:49:14] <scott_gonzalez> But we'll have it fixed tonight!
[17:49:26] <kswedberg> nice plugin: http://plugins.jquery.com/f/ :-/
[17:50:04] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[17:50:13] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i thought i did (it was late), what's up with accordion
[17:50:16] <scott_gonzalez> We're gonna need to go through and delete stuff.
[17:50:24] <kborchers> oh!
[17:50:26] <kborchers> it jumps
[17:50:29] <kborchers> :(
[17:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> Apparently having all these requirements doesn't stop the junk.
[17:50:32] <kborchers> crap
[17:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure mikesherov is fixing it already.
[17:50:59] <kborchers> i must have just saw it "work" and moved on
[17:51:06] <scott_gonzalez> But it'll be busted until 1.9.1 comes out.
[17:51:36] <kborchers> i was going through demos after i did all unit tests and all visual tests in most browsers so i was probably pretty blurry eyed by then. sorry
[17:51:48] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: 1.10.1 you mean?
[17:53:35] <scott_gonzalez> No, it's a bug in core.
[17:54:58] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...is bugs.jquery.com super slow for you?
[17:56:19] <petersendidit> yes
[17:57:38] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13183
[17:59:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, using jquery1-git.js fixes accordion.
[17:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> So we just need to wait for 1.9.1.
[17:59:48] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: I must've been thinking of api.jqueryui.com/1.9/ working on stage last night.
[17:59:59] <scott_gonzalez> I can see that it doesn't even exist in production.

[18:03:40] <petersendidit> scott_gonzalez: we might need to add a "doc's version listing"
[18:04:03] <petersendidit> A list of links to each of the old doc's
[18:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> Good idea.
[18:04:17] <petersendidit> pretty hard to find 1.8 if you need to
[18:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: I have an idea for that.
[18:13:11] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: How are we refering to learn in text?
[18:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> Visit ____
[18:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> if ___ is a link, what's the text?
[18:13:55] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: screenshot coming up.
[18:14:20] <kborchers> all of these !important are killing me :(
[18:14:23] <ajpiano> "Learn jQuery"
[18:14:30] <ajpiano> that's what's just in sites.php though
[18:14:52] <ajpiano> i feel like i want to settle on the jQuery Learning Center tbh
[18:15:54] <ajpiano> kborchers: looks like your hands are full atm?
[18:15:58] <ajpiano> i'll catch up w/ you in an hourish?
[18:16:17] <kborchers> ajpiano: sounds good, i'll be here
[18:19:40] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/0e1N2y2k0a1F
[18:19:54] <petersendidit> I like
[18:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> We can do that for all previous versions and then do something similar, but with more text for the current one.
[18:20:10] <petersendidit> yea
[18:20:35] <petersendidit> though that means we have to go update all the old docs when we release a new version?
[18:21:07] <scott_gonzalez> Thoughts on making that a header? http://cl.ly/image/41310y0L2e2v
[18:21:41] <scott_gonzalez> petersendidit: Yeah, but we can avoid that if we don't mind linking back to the current site in that list.
[18:21:50] <petersendidit> yea
[18:22:06] <scott_gonzalez> We can move the list into jquery-wp-content and pull it in as a template part.
[18:22:38] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to make the text at the top generic so that we can just copy/paste and change version numbers/
[18:22:47] <petersendidit> should http://api.jqueryui.com/1.10/ work today so it can be linked to?
[18:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should probably get that to work now.
[18:23:31] <petersendidit> I like it being a header
[18:23:43] <scott_gonzalez> Though it might be tricky.
[18:23:45] <petersendidit> makes it stand out and not get lost in the all the text on the page
[18:24:02] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[18:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano danheberden: What's going on?
[18:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> Let's move jquery.com to master.
[18:37:53] <mikesherov> scott_gonzalez: what am I fixing?
[18:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> The animation bug in core that you already fixed :-)
[18:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't realize you got to it already.
[18:38:32] <mikesherov> oh yeah, that was last night
[18:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> The one that makes our beautiful accordions look like crap :-P
[18:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like that's UI's fault.
[18:39:38] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well, it's fixed now.
[18:41:57] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: you rang?
[18:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Can you figure out why api.jqueryui.com/1.9/ doesn't exist?
[18:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> local and stage are working fine.
[18:42:38] <scott_gonzalez> Production doesn't seem to be missing any sites.
[18:42:43] <scott_gonzalez> Other than this one.
[18:43:42] <nacin> I don't see api.jqueryui.com/1.9/ installed in production
[18:43:44] <nacin> just 1.8
[18:43:51] <scott_gonzalez> Right, that's the problem :-)
[18:43:52] <nacin> will take a look
[18:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[18:48:50] <nacin> somehow, blog_id 21 is irc.jquery.org
[18:48:55] <nacin> along with blog_id 20
[18:49:38] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i'm afk, will be back in ~25ish, then yeah, lets do it
[18:49:53] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[18:50:01] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: sounds good
[18:51:37] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: okay, you're good
[18:51:54] <nacin> I backed out the site, reset mysql's auto-increment, and re-installed
[18:52:07] <nacin> I have some ideas for how to make the whole thing less error-prone, which I should be able to get to soon
[18:52:37] <nacin> in this case, I doubt it was a code issue, just that it didn't handle a problem very well.
[18:52:51] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[18:53:18] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: New issue that just came up. Don't spend too much time on this though.
[18:53:31] <scott_gonzalez> I just did a fresh clone of WordPress.
[18:53:43] <scott_gonzalez> Created a new database.
[18:53:52] <scott_gonzalez> Created wp-config.php to point at the new database.
[18:54:06] <scott_gonzalez> The URL is tmp.blog.jquery.com
[18:54:12] <scott_gonzalez> I load it and I get "Domain mapping issue. You have jquery-wp-content configured for dev.jquery.com."
[18:54:20] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not even using jquery-wp-content.
[18:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> It's a clean clone of the wordpress repo.
[18:54:34] <scott_gonzalez> Any ideas?

[18:56:12] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: you've clearly code jquery-wp-content referenced somewhere
[18:56:23] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: check your wp-config.php file. it will define the content directory (the DB doesn't)
[18:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[18:57:22] <scott_gonzalez> I do have a wildcard entry in Apache for *.jquery.com though.
[18:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> But I also have a wildcard entry for *.jqueryui.com and tmp.blog.jqueryui.com pointing at a separate install of WordPress works fine.
[18:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just try using a different domain.
[19:02:45] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...doesn't work at all with a different domain.
[19:02:50] <scott_gonzalez> Something screwy is going on here.
[19:14:45] <scott_gonzalez> Anyone got a few minutes to see if they can figure out why this very simple Apache vhost isn't working for me?
[19:16:07] <kborchers> ajpiano: have to step away for a few but will be back in about 10 min or so
[19:16:41] <ajpiano> aight
[19:17:22] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: are you using mamp
[19:17:27] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[19:17:35] <ajpiano> this rings a vague bell
[19:17:45] <scott_gonzalez> I don't use MAMP Pro though.
[19:17:50] <ajpiano> me neither
[19:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> So it's not MAMP trying to configure the vhost.
[19:18:02] <ajpiano> something about having like, the .htaccess from jquery-wp-content
[19:18:06] <ajpiano> or something
[19:18:10] <ajpiano> anywhere in the htdocs
[19:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not even using jquery-wp-content though.
[19:18:18] <ajpiano> yeah but somehow mamp still sees it,
[19:18:20] <ajpiano> or something :/
[19:21:31] <scott_gonzalez> Well this is going to make it difficult to work on the blog if I can't get a local setup :-(
[19:21:38] <ajpiano> i don't remember very well, i just remember trying to do stuff with the legacy events site
[19:21:53] <ajpiano> and still getting web-base-template rerors even though i had pointed mamp elsewhere
[19:22:12] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: can you try putting this fresh wordpress like, somewhere else besdies mamp's htdocs directory?
[19:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> It's not in the htdocs directory.
[19:22:41] <ajpiano> oh :/
[19:22:53] <ajpiano> what if you disable the other vhost?
[19:23:05] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/d9ce89364eea7ed2746d
[19:23:52] <scott_gonzalez> I tried deleting all other vhosts and I still get nothing.
[19:24:15] <ajpiano> get nothing meaning.....
[19:24:18] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting a 404 since I switched from tmp.blog.jquery.com to tmp-blog-jquery.com
[19:24:34] <ajpiano> so you don't get the jquery-wp-content error
[19:24:40] <ajpiano> you get a 404
[19:24:44] <ajpiano> with them all deleted?
[19:24:55] <scott_gonzalez> Well, just from the domain name change.
[19:25:03] <ajpiano> did you restart mamp?
[19:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? Even with them all deleted, if I go back to tmp.blog.jquery.com I get the domain mapping issue from jquery-wp-content.
[19:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, restart MAMP after each change.
[19:26:50] <ajpiano> hrm
[19:27:06] <ajpiano> i can't remember what makes the jquery-wp-content mapping issue so ... zealous
[19:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....
[19:27:39] <scott_gonzalez>  /Applications/MAMP/Library/bin/httpd -k start
[19:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> There are about a dozen of those in `ps ax`
[19:28:05] <ajpiano> hmm
[19:28:09] <ajpiano> maybe it didn't actually restart?
[19:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like there should be one.
[19:28:22] <ajpiano> right, they're all queued up and broke
[19:29:43] <scott_gonzalez> fixed
[19:29:58] <scott_gonzalez> Dear MAMP, I'd like to introduce you to my friend `kill`.
[19:30:57] <scott_gonzalez> Well that was a nice waste of time...
[19:32:26] <bgrins> Does anyone has a minute to look at a plugin submission that isn't working?

[19:34:26] <ajpiano> the name and manifest file need to be the same case, atm, bgrins and you need an author field
[19:37:32] <bgrins> ajpiano thanks!  Resubmitted
[19:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano danheberden: Are we ready to do this?
[19:38:38] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get the current work into master before I start doing the real work on the blog.
[19:38:48] <ajpiano> sure
[19:39:02] <kborchers> of course after i push that i find another case that need to be fixed ...
[19:39:06] <bgrins> ajpiano how long should it take for the submission to go through?
[19:39:21] <ajpiano> bgrins: i'm checking to see if it has
[19:39:55] <scott_gonzalez> bgrins: Try pushing the test hook button.
[19:40:02] <ajpiano> ah yes, that's the magic button
[19:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> We've been having an issue where GitHub doesn't have the tag available at the time that it notifies us.
[19:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> So we don't see that there's anything to do.
[19:40:25] <bgrins> magic button pressed
[19:40:35] <scott_gonzalez> And magic button worked!
[19:40:39] <ajpiano> ah yes indeeed
[19:40:40] <scott_gonzalez> You're not on the site!
[19:40:57] <scott_gonzalez> We're gonna add a small delay before we process to work around this bug.
[19:41:01] <ajpiano> weird it says it added to wordpress
[19:41:14] <ajpiano> but it's not there yet
[19:41:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's there.
[19:41:36] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i figure we should do one final tag of jquery-wp-content with whatever's landed tonight
[19:41:41] <scott_gonzalez> The No Hassle jQuery Colorpicker
[19:41:53] <ajpiano> ah, yeah there it is
[19:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Has anything landed?
[19:41:55] <ajpiano> 3rd refresh :p
[19:42:05] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: probably nginx cache
[19:42:21] <bgrins> wow, thanks!  Guess I should update the title to include the name
[19:42:32] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: only one thing that kborchers just landed 27 minutes ago
[19:42:35] <scott_gonzalez> top 3 commits
[19:42:48] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: i'm about to push another if that's ok

[19:46:06] <ajpiano> well kborchers the basic thing that is outstanding that i haven't had a chance to get to
[19:46:20] <bgrins> is there a way to update the title / description without retagging and making a new version?

[19:47:00] <scott_gonzalez> bgrins: Nope, tags are permanent.
[19:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Presumably any other changes can wait till tomorrow's deploy, right?
[19:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> I mean there's nothing urgent right now.
[19:48:02] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[19:48:11] <ajpiano> should we tag now and get these minor fixes up
[19:48:18] <ajpiano> this way the next deploy is completley aobut jquery.com stuff?

[19:53:54] <scott_gonzalez> DOIT
[19:54:03] <ajpiano> you want me to?
[19:54:17] <scott_gonzalez> Well, someone. I thought maybe danheberden would, but I guess he's afk for a bit?
[19:54:22] <scott_gonzalez> I can merge it.
[19:54:28] <ajpiano> heh ok
[19:54:50] <ajpiano> i'll merge it in jquery-wp-content right now
[19:55:02] <ajpiano> can you merge the jquery-com branch of jquery.com repo?
[19:55:10] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[19:56:05] <ajpiano> uhm..
[19:57:39] <ajpiano> it's the jquery-com branch right?
[19:57:42] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[19:57:50] <scott_gonzalez> Does it not do anything when you merge?
[19:57:52] <ajpiano> i go to merge and it says master's already up to do
[19:57:54] <ajpiano> up to date
[19:57:55] <ajpiano> yep
[19:58:03] <ajpiano> and my local site is showing the new design :p
[19:58:32] <scott_gonzalez> It's because I reverted EVERYTHING

[19:59:03] <scott_gonzalez> All of those commits still exist in master.
[19:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't want to force push jquery-wp-content.
[19:59:35] <ajpiano> ahh there come the images back
[20:00:04] <ajpiano> alright, so i'll just push that up to master and tag 2.0.13

[20:03:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[20:04:29] <bgrins> credit where credit is due for the new plugins site, really like the design and github integration!
[20:04:51] <ajpiano> thanks bgrins
[20:04:55] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks bgrins.
[20:05:05] <ajpiano> we are announcing all the new site stuff tomorrow, we are pretty psyched about how everything is working
[20:05:08] <ajpiano> but still a lot to do :)
[20:05:13] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I'll go through the commits to jquery.com since we branched and pull in anything that's still relevant.
[20:05:53] <bgrins> what new stuff are you announcing tomorrow?
[20:06:14] <ajpiano> bgrins: basically, *all* of our sites work like the plugins site now....
[20:06:26] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I guess I was supposed to update the file size when I put 1.9.0 on the home page?
[20:06:28] <ajpiano> all the content is in github, and when we push stuff to the content repos, the sites update
[20:06:40] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: it's pretty much the same
[20:06:43] <ajpiano> or if we push stuff to the themes
[20:06:58] <DaveMethvin> just add "-ish" to the number
[20:07:21] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: the file size of jquery 1.9 and jquery 1.8.3 rounded to the same # of kb
[20:07:25] <ajpiano> i noticed this when updating the footer
[20:07:27] <ajpiano> so you're all good
[20:07:39] <bgrins> so it is wordpress on the backend?  Do you use the wordpress UI at all or is it all managed through the git repos?
[20:07:51] <ajpiano> bgrins: we don't use the wordpress UI at all
[20:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> All through git + XML-RPC
[20:07:57] <ajpiano> bgrins: everything is synced ^^
[20:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> It's git -> grunt -> XML-RPC -> WordPress
[20:08:28] <scott_gonzalez> That full stack is actually quite big.
[20:08:42] <ajpiano> bgrins: http://stage.contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/ ... read the How It Works section :)
[20:08:47] <ajpiano> that's one of the things we're also anouncing tomorrow
[20:09:49] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: hey look, it's the jQuery Stimulus Package http://www.donanza.com/jobs/p7894607-update_script_to_compatibility_with_latest_jquery_jquery?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=feeder&utm_campaign=feeders
[20:10:16] <DaveMethvin> awwww yeah!
[20:10:26] <DaveMethvin> we're set for life!

[20:21:17] <bgrins> ajpiano not sure how transient that error data that you looked up for me is when I had mistakes in my spectrum.jquery.json, but regarding this issue: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/11 it would be awesome if I could just go to something like http://status.plugins.jquery.com/spectrum/ and see a print out like:  Manifest errors: github/bgrins/spectrum 1.0.3 spectrum.jquery.json [ 'Name must match manifest file name
[20:21:17] <b-ot> bgrins, issue #11 by scottgonzalez (12mon 4w ago): Inform user of errors
[20:21:34] <ajpiano> bgrins: yeah, the plan for #11 is to pipe that info back to the user
[20:21:35] <bgrins> then you could refer people to that url rather than having to manually look up problem
[20:21:44] <ajpiano> via an e-mail or a github comment, etc
[20:21:48] <stanlemon> Hello, how long does it take for a plugin to become published once a tag has been pushed?
[20:22:10] <ajpiano> right now we're just tailing the logs from the server and pasting them back to people who are having trouble, such as yourself :)
[20:22:27] <stanlemon> ah, mine had an issue then?
[20:22:38] <ajpiano> checking right now, stanlemon
[20:22:42] <stanlemon> thanks
[20:23:17] <ajpiano> hmm, no problems that i see ... stanlemon can you try pressing the "Test Hook" button in your repo
[20:23:51] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I'm gonna put that delay in right now...
[20:23:52] <stanlemon> just hit
[20:23:58] <ajpiano> stanlemon: you pushed for the first time like what, 5 minutes ago ?
[20:24:02] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: probably a good idea :p
[20:24:06] <stanlemon> ajpiano, correct
[20:24:34] <ajpiano> hm
[20:24:46] <stanlemon> wasn't sure if I needed to wait a period of time or a review or if something had gone awry
[20:25:15] <ajpiano> stanlemon: we are definitely still working out some kinks
[20:25:30] <stanlemon> are you seeing anything when I hit the test hook button, it's not clear to me if github is doing anything when I press this
[20:25:54] <ajpiano> stanlemon: yeah, i am seeing that the request is being made, but it's not finding any tags to process
[20:26:31] <stanlemon> tags are just like 1.2.7 correct?
[20:26:36] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: any idea yeah
[20:26:38] <ajpiano> yeah
[20:27:07] <jqcommit> 01[13contribute.jquery.org01] 15dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/Bpk3Vw

[20:27:13] <stanlemon> will it recognize a fourth value, if I try 1.2.7.1 for example - just curious if doing something like that might help debug anything
[20:27:39] <ajpiano> stanlemon: you can try pushing 1.2.7-1 or a 1.2.8
[20:28:05] <stanlemon> 1.2.7-1 just pushed
[20:30:27] <ajpiano> hmm stanlemon no luck yet
[20:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> This is one of those blackhole errors.
[20:30:50] <ajpiano> ahh yeah
[20:30:53] <ajpiano> it says "No valid releases"
[20:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> It found the manifest for 1.2.7 but didn't report the problem.
[20:30:58] <jqcommit> 01[13contribute.jquery.org01] 15dmethvin pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/S9fohQ
[20:30:58] <jqcommit> 13contribute.jquery.org/06master 14bc6a693 15Dave Methvin: No, this time I tested.
[20:31:29] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: is "No valid releases" the same as "not reporting the problem" http://cl.ly/image/2p3D223e0120
[20:31:29] <stanlemon> anything I can do to help debug?
[20:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> No valid releases means that it found tags to process, but none of them had valid manifests.
[20:32:35] <scott_gonzalez> But it's tricky because the problem isn't from inside the manifest.
[20:32:44] <scott_gonzalez> One exampe of this is invalid JSON.
[20:32:49] <stanlemon> The manifest is here: https://github.com/stanlemon/jGrowl/blob/master/jgrowl.jquery.json
[20:32:50] <scott_gonzalez> But this file is valid.
[20:32:50] <ajpiano> ah
[20:33:04] <stanlemon> My original commit had invalid json, but this was fixed and the tag is applied to the fix revision
[20:33:28] <ajpiano> should he try a 1.2.8 ?
[20:33:50] <stanlemon> if I change to 1.2.8 does the version # inside of the manifest file need to change with it?
[20:34:02] <ajpiano> indeed
[20:34:17] <stanlemon> Ok, so do you want me to make that change and commit it then?
[20:34:42] <ajpiano> yeah, that would be good
[20:35:18] <stanlemon> done and pushed
[20:35:42] <scott_gonzalez> The manifest still has 1.2.7 as the version, should be 1.2.7-1
[20:35:58] <stanlemon> what I just pushed should be 1.2.8 in both places, tag and manifest
[20:36:18] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that just hasn't come through yet :-)
[20:36:40] <stanlemon> if I were to delete a tag and reposition it would that cause problems?
[20:36:53] <scott_gonzalez> It won't reprocess a tag of the same name.
[20:37:00] <ajpiano> yeah, you don't want to repush used tag/versions
[20:37:19] <ajpiano> hmmm weird, i see it getting the 1.2.7-1 stuff 2 minutes ago, but nothing for a 1.2.8
[20:37:25] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[20:37:32] <scott_gonzalez> press the button :-)
[20:37:37] <stanlemon> which button?
[20:38:47] <scott_gonzalez> The test hook button.
[20:38:54] <stanlemon> hit
[20:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> done
[20:39:02] <scott_gonzalez> It worked.
[20:39:11] <stanlemon> cool!
[20:39:12] <stanlemon> thanks guys
[20:39:17] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[20:39:21] <stanlemon> so will I need to hit the test hook button in the future?
[20:39:23] <ajpiano> http://plugins.jquery.com/jgrowl/
[20:39:29] <scott_gonzalez> We'll have these issues sorted out soon.
[20:39:34] <ajpiano> stanlemon: nope, we are trying to work out the kinks :)
[20:39:36] <ajpiano> thanks for bearing with us
[20:39:51] <stanlemon> cool, thanks for piecing this together - love the github tie in for publishing, really great stuff
[20:39:56] <stanlemon> keep up the great work, and thanks guys!

[20:40:57] <ajpiano> yeah, it's definitely a hack

[20:46:49] <scott_gonzalez> Probably, she gave me a 0 almost every day.
[20:46:57] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know what that means in terms of actual grades though.
[20:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> It always seemed like an odd threat.
[20:47:11] <scott_gonzalez> 0 out of what?
[20:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> How do you even factor that into a final grade?
[20:48:57] <ajpiano> hah yea
[20:49:09] <ajpiano> it depends if it's like a 0 on an assignment that factors into your average
[20:49:17] <ajpiano> in which case, it's disastrous
[20:49:30] <ajpiano> if it's just the amorphous "give you a 0" i have no idea
[20:49:36] <ajpiano> especially prominent in gym class
[20:49:56] <ajpiano> where the 0s are averaged with NO OTHER NUMBERS
[20:50:02] <ajpiano> to produce ... a pass/fail grade
[20:50:11] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[20:54:51] <ajpiano> hi yksk
[20:55:32] <ajpiano> yksk: are you @yoko on github and just tried to submit https://github.com/yoko/jquery.dataset.js/blob/master/dataset.jquery.json to the plugins site?
[20:56:42] <yksk> yes
[20:56:50] <ajpiano> yksk: ah ok
[20:56:53] <ajpiano> was just commenting on your commit
[20:56:54] <ajpiano> Manifest errors: github/yoko/jquery.dataset.js 1.0.2 dataset.jquery.json [ 'Invalid characters for keyword: html 5.' ]
[20:57:18] <scott_gonzalez> no spaces allowed
[20:57:24] <ajpiano> can't have spaces in the keywords - can you update the manifest to 1.0.3 and tag again
[20:57:53] <yksk> oh
[20:57:58] <yksk> ok, thanks!
[20:59:26] <ajpiano> cool, let us know when you've tried that again
[21:10:40] <kborchers> ajpiano: thoughts on the direction, tone, content of this so far https://gist.github.com/4562486  i've also put in a skeleton of where i am headed with it. any feedback appreciated, especially if i'm way off on anything :)
[21:20:31] <ajpiano> looks great so far actually kborchers :)
[21:20:47] <kborchers> ajpiano: ok, cool. i will continue :)

[21:42:15] <scott_gonzalez> TIL CSS @import must be at the top of the file.
[21:42:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: back
[21:46:14] <scott_gonzalez> Hey gnarf.
[21:46:37] <scott_gonzalez> I put in a 20 second delay for processing hooks.
[21:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can you set up stage.blog.jquery.com as a copy of the current production blog?
[21:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> Or even temp.blog.jquery.com.
[21:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> So something for me to put this theme on.
[21:53:35] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: probably early afternoon
[21:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I've got the theme ready.
[21:55:47] <scott_gonzalez> At least as good as the UI one.
[21:55:55] <ajpiano> that's about as good as it has to be
[21:55:56] <ajpiano> :p
[21:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> And I made some tweaks to jquery-wp-content to make it easier to pull in updates.
[21:57:35] <ajpiano> ah, nice
[22:09:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: ?
[22:14:08] <gnarf> hey sorry
[22:14:38] <gnarf> digging in to the blog thing
[22:17:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: not setting up DNS, just setting it up on the same machine (eol1)
[22:17:28] <gnarf> temp.blog.jquery.com
[22:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[22:22:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: should be good to go

[22:27:12] <gnarf> its apache
[22:27:15] <gnarf> ont hat machine
[22:27:17] <gnarf> and im not sure
[22:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's not the problem.
[22:27:56] <scott_gonzalez> I can't access temp.blog.jquery.com/wp-admin/
[22:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> It redirects me to blog.jquery.com.
[22:43:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm heading to bed.
