[07:39:38] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: how about now? https://github.com/jquery/meetings.jquery.org/pull/9
[07:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> The two space things is strange.
[07:43:02] <scott_gonzalez> And it creates odd spacing. For example, scroll to the bottom of http://stage.meetings.jquery.org/category/core/page/8/
[07:43:43] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see what's going on though.
[07:43:55] <scott_gonzalez> You're trying to create a <br>
[07:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[07:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know what happened here? https://github.com/jquery/meetings.jquery.org/commit/d482b849a3b8c937dd48b3105bd1b79cea7db9ce#L0L32
[07:44:52] <scott_gonzalez> Random two spaces in the middle of lines.
[07:46:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the strange spacing on that page is because you have SPACE SPACE NEWLINE NEWLINE.
[07:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> You only want one new line.
[07:53:13] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez:  I'm not sure what odd spacing you're referring to, in the output
[07:53:34] <jzaefferer> I see it in the md files
[07:54:41] <scott_gonzalez> It's generating paragraphs. I added a comment on the PR about it.
[07:56:21] <jzaefferer> oka
[07:56:23] <jzaefferer> well
[07:57:19] <jzaefferer> "I'm not sure how much time we want to spend on cleaning this stuff up" - I dunno what DaveMethvin thinks about that, but I don't think we should be spending any more time on this. The content is all there, even if the formatting is whacky here and there.
[07:57:44] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer i am good with what is there, and grateful!
[07:58:03] <DaveMethvin> especially if the choice is manual cleanup
[07:58:04] <jzaefferer> We could just write the raw html instead of converting to md and back, but then we have the terrible GDocs markup still in there
[07:58:22] <DaveMethvin> the content is there, and it can be read
[07:58:39] <DaveMethvin> i'm not worried about whether the minutes from 2011 have some stray chars or formatting :D
[08:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it's also content from as recently as 2 months ago...
[08:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> But I assume that won't change your mind at all.
[08:05:47] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I'm not sure it's going to get much better with the script, so there's no reason not to land this.
[08:06:33] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ^
[08:12:39] <jzaefferer> Yeah, I don't really see any way to address these issues with more scripting

[11:41:37] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: That seems like an oversight. The default theme should have some colors applied.

[12:57:23] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez jzaefferer Hi, sorry to be bothering you... I've just realised that the testing category is missing from the meetings site. Is that because you still want to tidy up before you make these fully discoverable?
[13:00:24] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It's in the sidebar.
[13:00:48] <jzaefferer> Yeah, its here: http://meetings.jquery.org/category/testing/
[13:00:59] <scott_gonzalez> Has been since the day the site went live.
[13:01:22] <jzaefferer> should the Meetings link in the top-nav go here? https://jquery.org/meeting/
[13:01:35] <agcolom> I can see only 4 categories
[13:01:45] <agcolom> Sorry 
[13:01:52] <agcolom> Just realised the 3rd one is testing! 
[13:02:23] <agcolom> I'm just going to hide in a cave...!!!!
[13:02:26] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: That page should go away.
[13:02:34] <agcolom> SOOoo sorry!!!!
[13:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> rworth ajpiano: The meetings nav link on jquery.org should point to meetings.jquery.org, correct?
[13:02:58] <jzaefferer> delete the page, update web-base-template (aka something new, still not used to the new name) to point at the subdomain?
[13:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> And the exisitng /meeting/ page should go away.
[13:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> jquery-wp-content
[13:03:34] <jzaefferer> I should probably rename the folder on my disk
[13:03:38] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:03:40] <jzaefferer> forcing me to use the new name...
[13:03:44] <rworth> scott_gonzalez correct
[13:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: Did you want to do that?
[13:06:25] <jzaefferer> I can do it now
[13:06:30] <jzaefferer> kinda stuck with the Jenkins move
[13:06:53] <jzaefferer> QUnit builds, UI doesn't

[13:13:46] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez rworth: we need a redirect for https://stage.jquery.org/meeting, right?
[13:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> It certainly wouldn't hurt.
[13:16:18] <jzaefferer> is there a WordPress option for that?
[13:16:25] <jzaefferer> or do we handle that within nginx?
[13:17:55] <scott_gonzalez> Pretty sure we're doing all redirects in nginx.
[13:23:16] <rworth> yeah nginx for redirects
[13:23:18] <rworth> through puppet
[13:29:05] <jzaefferer> hey gnarf, I want to add a redirect from jquery.org/meeting to meetings.jquery.org - can you give me a pointer where to find that in the puppet repo?
[13:31:08] <jzaefferer> I may have found something...
[13:31:44] <jzaefferer> manifests/nodes/wordpress.pp
[13:34:59] <jzaefferer> gnarf: this should work, right? https://gist.github.com/jzaefferer/1e1ed0efb9dfde704a47

[13:50:51] <jzaefferer> gnarf rworth scott_gonzalez: redirect in place, link update, page deleted
[13:51:10] <jzaefferer> next time we need a redirect, I can look at the readme addition I made, instead of waiting for gnarf to show me :-)
[13:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks jzaefferer
[13:59:37] <jzaefferer> https://local.jquery.org fails to load any CSS files, probably because css files are loaded from http (no ssl). On jquery.org it loads those resources from https. What's the difference?
[14:00:45] <rworth> I've never tried https with local.
[14:03:14] <jzaefferer> it works with just http, but the nav links all have https in front

[17:29:35] <dsteinbrunner> Hey, noticed at the bottom of http://jquery.com/ there is the quick access CDN link
[17:29:49] <dsteinbrunner> and it has the 1.9.1 release
[17:30:39] <dsteinbrunner> and then says: Download jQuery 1.9.1 â†’
[17:31:15] <dsteinbrunner> I'm assuming that should be bumped to 1.10.1
[17:40:25] <ajpiano> thanks dsteinbrunner
[17:40:31] <dsteinbrunner> also the download page still has a mention of 1.10.0 and should be 1.10.1
[17:40:43] <ajpiano> we'll get that updated as soon as it actually hits the cdn
[17:41:13] <dsteinbrunner> I was going to send a patch but too many hoops to contribute such a minor thing
[17:41:28] <ajpiano> how are there too many hoops?
[17:41:42] <dsteinbrunner> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md
[17:41:53] <dsteinbrunner> mostly the contributor license agreement.

[17:42:26] <ajpiano> dsteinbrunner: it takes like 1 second to sign the CLA
[17:42:41] <ajpiano> but i have worried that folks would view it as an obstacle
[17:42:42] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery.org01] 15rdworth tagged 06v1.1.10 at 14511e68d: 02http://git.io/wct2sQ
[17:43:36] <ajpiano> it does seem weird to have to sign a CLA for minor copy changes
[17:43:51] <dsteinbrunner> sure but I don't see the need to give out that info for that
[17:43:58] <ajpiano> but it's kind of the nature of running a large multifaceted open source project
[17:43:59] <dsteinbrunner> yeah..
[17:44:10] <dsteinbrunner> I slightly understand
[17:44:50] <ajpiano> it wouldn't really make sense for us to have separate types of contributions where sometimes you do and don't have to sign the CLA
[17:45:05] <dsteinbrunner> I have been making similar changes to perl core without that kind of concern
[17:45:32] <ajpiano> interesting
[17:45:55] <dsteinbrunner> when using github you already getting name, username and email ;-P
[17:46:11] <ajpiano> i wonder how the perl foundation deals with delineating which types of changes do and don't require a CLA
[17:46:15] <ajpiano> or do they not even require a CLA at all
[17:46:24] <ajpiano> even for code changes
[17:46:33] <dsteinbrunner> I don't think so
[17:46:53] <ajpiano> http://www.perlfoundation.org/contributor_license_agreement
[17:48:30] <dsteinbrunner> hmmm, I have only been following the mailing list for a few weeks and have not see this ever mentioned
[17:48:38] <ajpiano> the perl mailing list?
[17:48:48] <dsteinbrunner> p5p
[17:49:19] <dsteinbrunner> perl5-porters
[17:49:34] <ajpiano> i am not a lawyer, so i don't really know the intricacies of it, but i don't believe name and e-mail is enough information if the rubber ever hits the road
[17:49:42] <ajpiano> the dojo foundation also requires a CLA for all contributions
[17:49:58] <ajpiano> anyhow, you raise an interesting point, i will want to see how they manage it
[17:50:21] <ajpiano> because i get how in principle it is weird to require your home address so you can make a one character change to a website
[17:50:22] <ajpiano> etc.
[17:50:39] <ajpiano> but that is a longer term conversation, and i am already late for dinner :p
[17:50:52] <dsteinbrunner> true that
[17:50:54] <ajpiano> dsteinbrunner: can you file issues for these things at the very least, i must run
[17:52:20] <ajpiano> thanks a bunch in case you part before i return :)
[18:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> dsteinbrunner ajpiano: name + email is in no way equivalent to a CLA.
[18:00:40] <scott_gonzalez> It's not even about the contact info, it's about the license agreement.
[18:01:13] <scott_gonzalez> Here's the deal with requiring CLAs for minor copy change.
[18:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> In reality, we don't care. It's completely irrelevant when looking at trivial changes, especially copy changes.
[18:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> But, we collect CLAs for everything because we want to be able to easil audit our repos.
[18:04:10] <scott_gonzalez> For every single commit that doesn't have a CLA, we'll need to manually track the SHA and provide a reason why a CLA is not relevant for the change.
[18:04:23] <scott_gonzalez> It's much easier to just get a CLA from every contributor.
