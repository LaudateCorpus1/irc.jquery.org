[10:50:35] <jeremyckahn> Hi guys, I'm watching the conversation here: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/pull/137
[10:50:57] <jeremyckahn> I didn't realize the site was being updated.  Is it being replaced entirely?
[10:56:37] <scott_gonzalez> jeremyckahn: Yeah, the entire site is being changed.
[10:57:25] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why nobody mentioned that in the discussion.
[10:59:15] <jeremyckahn> It happens.  Should I just close Pull Request?
[11:02:17] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's why I'm trying to figure out when they plan on launching the new site.
[11:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think anyone has started on implementation.
[11:03:05] <scott_gonzalez> If they're aiming for a few weeks from now, I'm not sure that the current design with 1.8.3 would even go live.
[11:03:20] <scott_gonzalez> But if they're still months away, then we can update to 1.8.3.
[11:03:34] <scott_gonzalez> But that's a question for ajpiano or DaveMethvin or rworth.
[11:04:12] <DaveMethvin> scott_gonzalez: that must be an ajpiano question, i didn't know we were doing anything new with jquery.com
[11:04:54] <jeremyckahn> I'll let you guys figure it out and stand by. :)
[11:05:03] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6a3nbd8w4xdzw9v/jQuery-Home3.png
[11:28:50] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ping
[11:30:51] <ajpiano> i would be pretty surprised if that's ready for in 2 weeks
[11:31:14] <ajpiano> seems fine to upgrade to 1.8.3 or even 1.9 at that point
[11:31:22] <ajpiano> on "old" jquery.com
[11:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: What's up with learn.jquery.com?
[11:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> I can't deploy.

[13:14:47] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: that should fix that
[13:15:54] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, I can deploy now.
[13:16:02] <scott_gonzalez> So what's the deal with getting learn on new-css?
[13:16:07] <scott_gonzalez> Are you working on that?
[13:16:19] <scott_gonzalez> Or is that something I should be working on?
[13:17:07] <ajpiano> i haven't had a chance to, if you could help i'd appreciate it
[13:17:36] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know what's going on with https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/pull/129 ?
[13:17:40] <scott_gonzalez> Seems stale.
[13:18:13] <scott_gonzalez> new-css doesn't seem to have any learn styles.
[13:18:29] <ajpiano> it is stale
[13:18:52] <ajpiano> could be used as a jumping off point but the template stuff is kind of irrelevant right now
[13:19:13] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> So, here's where we are right now:
[13:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.com is good to deploy (using old content/styles).
[13:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> qunitjs.com and api.qunitjs.com are good to deploy.
[13:20:14] <scott_gonzalez> api.jqueryui.com and api.jqueryui.com/1.8/ are good to deploy.
[13:20:38] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com is good with the exception of ThemeRoller/download builder, which Rafael is actively working on.
[13:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't touched blog.jqueryui.com, but that should be fairly easy.
[13:21:31] <scott_gonzalez> api.jquerymobile.com is good to go, but you should check out the header background and link colors.
[13:22:30] <ajpiano> ok, checking
[13:22:37] <ajpiano> that's awesome
[13:22:50] <rworth> indeed
[13:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> I think jquery.org is as good as it should be right now (still needs content work).
[13:23:06] <rworth> yup
[13:23:14] <ajpiano> yeah, as long as the theme isn't broken, that's ok
[13:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> contribute.jquery.com is updated, but it's obviously lacking content.
[13:23:39] <ajpiano> oh awesome
[13:23:53] <ajpiano> exactly, i want to get that content done but it didn't have much in the way of theme
[13:24:09] <ajpiano> so good that it's ready on new-css
[13:24:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so based on that, I'd say we get the ThemeRoller updates done to finish out jqueryui.com.
[13:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'll update blog.jqueryui.com (sucks that we still need to do this outside of web-base-template).
[13:25:25] <scott_gonzalez> Then I'll move on to the plugins site.
[13:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> Once those are done, I think we're ready to launch.
[13:26:07] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll be doing the switch over to new-css without learn and contribute.
[13:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> Those can launch as soon as they're ready.
[13:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> Do you still have content work to do before the learn launch?
[13:26:40] <scott_gonzalez> I know you wanted it to go live with contribute, but how important is that?
[13:26:56] <ajpiano> i think the content is as good as it's gonna get pre-launch
[13:27:07] <ajpiano> i think it's kind of important
[13:27:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we'll hold off on the learn deploy then.
[13:27:23] <ajpiano> when you say switch over without learn and contribute
[13:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> So does that plan sound good?
[13:27:31] <ajpiano> you mean that we'll merge new-css to master before they're live?
[13:27:39] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[13:27:53] <ajpiano> yeah, that sounds great then
[13:27:55] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we won't be able to actually merge, we'll just need to rename the branches.
[13:28:10] <ajpiano> heh, yeah
[13:28:23] <ajpiano> master -> old-css :p
[13:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> Cool, if gnarf ever shows up, we should be able to get api.jquery.com live.
[13:28:43] <scott_gonzalez> Either as part of the new-css roll out or sooner.
[13:28:49] <scott_gonzalez> I have everything ready for it to go live today.
[13:29:04] <scott_gonzalez> In fact, I deployed to our production server already :-P

[13:29:13] <scott_gonzalez> We just need the DNS switched over.
[13:29:29] <ajpiano> ah awesome
[13:29:45] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Does that mobile commit mean the header color was ok?
[13:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> It was a random color that I picked :-P
[13:30:19] <ajpiano> derp
[13:30:27] <scott_gonzalez> I think I took the color of the pixel just above the menu nav and shortened it to fit in #abc form...
[13:30:50] <ajpiano> i'll fix that up
[13:30:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'm a jerk like that.
[13:31:04] <ajpiano> oh yeah that is one thing that sucks
[13:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> I should've done something like hot pink to make it obvious that it was the wrong color.
[13:31:14] <ajpiano> is that the stupid sprite in the menu nav
[13:31:18] <ajpiano> has the old colours
[13:31:31] <scott_gonzalez> Right, we need to get that fixed.
[13:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't we talk about just changing it to a flat color?
[13:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> I think I tried and failed because the CSS is crazy.
[13:32:36] <ajpiano> flat colour would be fine, we just need the damn sprite
[13:32:39] <ajpiano> or to recreate it from scratch
[13:34:01] <scott_gonzalez> Well, let me take another stab at this.
[13:34:19] <scott_gonzalez> I think we can use the existing sprite and just never use the icons with the backgrounds.
[13:34:20] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/0a462K1j1K0V

[13:34:37] <ajpiano> oh i see what you're saying
[13:34:45] <ajpiano> just have the active stat use the top row as well
[13:34:52] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:34:56] <ajpiano> considering we're ditching that stupid menu anyway, that works for me for now
[13:35:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll try to get that updated.
[13:35:28] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like some of the other CSS changes I made to that menu make this easier than the first time I tried.
[13:35:54] <scott_gonzalez> Somehow these were all styled in such a way that the clickable area wasn't even visible.
[13:36:28] <ajpiano> isn't ditching all projects as simple as adding qunit and sizzle into that sprite and header, linking them, and removing the actual thing that slides down?
[13:36:49] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, though the original mockup had tooltips with those descriptions.
[13:37:10] <ajpiano> that can be readded as a feature
[13:37:15] <scott_gonzalez> Yup.
[13:37:32] <scott_gonzalez> The big thing right now is just getting the icons into the sprite like you said.
[13:37:46] <scott_gonzalez> We also need the new mobile favicon.
[13:37:49] <ajpiano> yup
[13:37:53] <ajpiano> i was just looking at that issue
[13:38:04] <scott_gonzalez> Are you able to make that from the existing sprite?
[13:38:08] <ajpiano> i already ihave ps/illus open right now
[13:38:13] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[13:38:18] <ajpiano> i can make the icon and the new sprite image
[13:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:38:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'd love to get https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues?state=open down to a single page today.
[13:39:18] <ajpiano> alrighty
[13:39:57] <ajpiano> i have a party at my house starting in a bit, i'll try to get 130 and 68 done quickly
[13:40:51] <scott_gonzalez> That'd be great.
[13:41:10] <ajpiano> for the favicon, do i have to do anything in the theme besdies just add an i/favicon.ico in the theme folders?
[13:41:40] <ajpiano> i guess i'll find out :p
[13:44:32] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so.

[14:20:38] <ajpiano> why does jquery.org have an images diretory, and every other site has an i directory
[14:21:07] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure; jquery.org should probably change.
[14:21:15] <ajpiano> ya
[14:21:31] <ajpiano> turns out most of the sites that should have a jquery favicon don't have a favicon at all

[14:27:11] <scott_gonzalez> It's right at the top.
[14:27:18] <ajpiano> it WAS right at the top
[14:27:19] <ajpiano> :D
[14:27:24] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[14:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, didn't you have something you wanted to ask me the other dya?
[14:27:39] <scott_gonzalez> Right when I was leaving.
[14:27:40] <ajpiano> yeah, but it's complicated
[14:27:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok, tomorrow
[14:27:51] <ajpiano> basically it's that for highlight.js we need a custom build of it
[14:28:02] <ajpiano> and i don't know how to automate that build, it requires python etc
[14:28:12] <ajpiano> but we'll figure it out
[14:28:16] <ajpiano> i might not be around much/at all tom
[14:28:19] <ajpiano> but yeah, later this week
[14:28:24] <ajpiano> but in case you are curious
[14:28:35] <ajpiano> the reason why is that if you build it custom with only the languages you need
[14:28:46] <ajpiano> instead of like 40 langages
[14:28:54] <ajpiano> it doesn't mis-identify all the languages :p
[14:29:24] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[14:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> makes sense
[14:29:35] <scott_gonzalez> We'll talk later in the week.
[14:29:38] <ajpiano> sounds good
[14:29:39] <scott_gonzalez> Happy New Year.
[14:29:42] <ajpiano> happy new year !!!!

[14:30:32] <agcolom> ?
[14:30:41] <ajpiano> no, you just pushed a massive merge commit :p
[14:31:00] <ajpiano> agcolom: always pull with --rebase :)
[14:31:10] <agcolom> oh!
[14:31:28] <agcolom> so I should do git pull and then git rebase 
[14:32:20] <ajpiano> no
[14:32:24] <agcolom> or is it git pull --rebase?
[14:32:24] <ajpiano> git pull --rebase
[14:32:43] <agcolom> ok. I didn't know. I'll do that in the future!
[14:32:50] <agcolom> Really sorry!
