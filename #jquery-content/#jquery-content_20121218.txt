[07:09:12] <scott_gonzalez> I think the install script gets really mad when you try to install sites out of order.
[07:09:35] <scott_gonzalez> I hadn't installed brand.jquery.org yet (site 18) when I tried to install contribute.jquery.com (site 19)

[12:55:20] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I ran into the same issue and after a refresh it was fine
[12:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> No, it's definitely not fine.
[12:55:43] <scott_gonzalez> It may seem like that one site is fine, but everything is hosed.
[12:55:49] <rworth> oh, good to know
[12:55:50] <scott_gonzalez> You'll never get earlier sites installed.
[12:55:55] <rworth> doh
[12:55:59] <rworth> nacin ! ;)
[12:56:19] <scott_gonzalez> You need to go into MySQL, delete the tables for the messed up site(s) and then change the AUTO_INCREMENT in wp_blogs
[12:57:43] <rworth> what if I just drop my db?
[12:58:13] <rworth> been meaning to do that anyway, caus I get an error when trying to deploy dev.jqueryui.com
[12:58:27] <rworth> unless you want to explore the error with me while it's still around
[13:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> I could do that.
[13:02:57] <rworth> let me pull it up
[13:04:10] <rworth> scott_gonzalez https://gist.github.com/4331991
[13:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> screenshare?
[13:05:32] <rworth> ok
[13:57:37] <nacin> does dropping the DB and trying again work?
[13:57:52] <nacin> rworth: scott_gonzalez: It seems like maybe the issue is that some sites got re-arranged in the array, or something?
[13:58:08] <nacin> Core is finicky about blog IDs, though we can rewrite the script to make it less unstable.
[14:02:52] <rworth> nacin haven't tried yet, but will let you know
[18:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: The problem is that I hadn't installed site 18 the first time I visited site 19.
[18:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> So it tried to install site 19, but the next AUTO_INCREMENT was 18.
