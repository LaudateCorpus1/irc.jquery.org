[06:23:59] <scott_gonzalez> rworth ajpiano: Can I just close issues like this? https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/58
[06:24:30] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise the issue queue will just grow and grow with features that could be useful but won't get implemented (certainly not for a while).
[06:24:44] <rworth> maybe close it with a label?
[06:24:47] <rworth> like someday-maybe
[06:28:08] <scott_gonzalez> done
[07:22:11] <scott_gonzalez> OMG, there is so much custom styling in the plugins site.
[07:22:26] <scott_gonzalez> The three column layout, icons inside headers, etc.
[07:22:43] <scott_gonzalez> None of it is in the framework. It's also custom to the plugins site.
[09:02:26] <nacin> $ ssh jq01.jquery.com 'uptime' | grep -o load.*
[09:02:26] <nacin> load average: 1.73, 1.64, 1.69
[09:20:27] <gnarf> yeah
[09:20:32] <gnarf> that cache change was pro
[09:20:33] <gnarf> for sure
[09:31:58] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i  noticed the same thing about the plugins site
[09:32:04] <ajpiano> so much random arbitrary stuff
[09:32:26] <ajpiano> and also like a million things that should probably just be headers but instead they're custom elements that use the header fonts

[13:23:54] <scott_gonzalez> Man, the styles on the plugins site are really hard to work with.
[13:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to rip this stuff out and just use the grid to create the third column inside the content area.
[13:26:44] <ajpiano> that's what i meant about slash and burn, baby
[13:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> I'm ripping out most of these media queries too.
[13:30:26] <scott_gonzalez> We either need stuff adjusting properly everywhere or it's not worth maintaining.
[13:30:53] <scott_gonzalez> There are tons of rules in the plugins themes for adjusting font size on random elements :-(
[13:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> "The new-new-CSS doesn't support a secondary bar - it has only #sidebar"
[13:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> From a comment in the CSS.
[13:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> WTF?
[13:33:20] <scott_gonzalez> "so we unfortunately need to replicate some stuff from base.css here."
[13:45:47] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i am skeptical of the need at this point for custom media queries in any child theme
[13:46:05] <ajpiano> yeah
[13:47:17] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i feel like you should just replace all graadients with flat color
[13:47:26] <ajpiano> and we can add gradients back in once we add css preprocessor
[13:47:52] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I'm ripping stuff out left and right: https://gist.github.com/b302bea8698d3564dfb4
[13:48:41] <ajpiano> no worky
[13:48:56] <scott_gonzalez> You can't see the gist?

[13:49:08] <ajpiano> it loads that page really fast thoug

[14:10:03] <ajpiano> dang that's a serious gist
[14:23:34] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: What color should links be for the plugins site?
[14:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> I've got blue/purple right now from the defaults.
[14:41:39] <ajpiano> it should be #0769AD scott_gonzalez

[21:00:14] <scott_gonzalez> hey
[21:00:31] <ajpiano> fun times
[21:00:47] <ajpiano> the grunt version stuff
[21:00:52] <ajpiano> had meant a fresh clone of jquery core was broken
[21:01:06] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[21:01:17] <ajpiano> what a pain in the arse
[21:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[21:01:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's pretty bad when a version number is reused.
[21:01:58] <ajpiano> i pushed shas that work, seems ok for now
[21:02:15] <ajpiano> yeah
[21:02:41] <scott_gonzalez> Seems fine for a few days.
[21:02:44] <ajpiano> we are gonna have to update all the multi tasks
[21:02:49] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[21:03:00] <scott_gonzalez> I pinged jzaefferer about that this morning.
[21:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> Was hoping he could get stuff updated while I'm working on the plugins site.
[21:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> He updated a bunch of stuff for 0.4 before.
[21:03:47] <ajpiano> yea hopefully there won't be anymore grunt api changes :/
[21:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> Then Ben went and changed it all again :-P
[21:03:58] <ajpiano> yeah
[21:04:36] <scott_gonzalez> As long as the new API is better and is becoming stable, we'll be good.
[21:05:22] <ajpiano> yeah, confirm, the changes should be minor and i trust ben and all those guys judgment if it was necessary
[21:05:23] <ajpiano> i just saw
[21:05:24] <ajpiano> <blar1> running 'npm install' is currently failing with "no compatible version found: grunt-contrib-jshint"... i'm a bit confused by this, as the package page for grunt-contrib-jshint says that it's not ready for release.  why is jquery installation failing when a not-ready for release package is not available?
[21:05:27] <ajpiano> and i was like.... fuuuuuuuuuu
[21:06:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, they really dropped the ball on the whole pre-releae phase.
[21:06:44] <ajpiano> yeah
[21:06:52] <ajpiano> cause the thing is, once you say RC
[21:07:01] <ajpiano> people start feeling comfortable moving forward with adapting to it
[21:07:07] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[21:07:14] <ajpiano> and then if you bite them in the ass
[21:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> Not only that, it's not a good idea to publish a final version of a plugin against an rc of the main system.
[21:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> So none of the contrib plugins should've been 0.1.0 yet.
[21:08:07] <ajpiano> yeah, definitely
[21:08:41] <ajpiano> it probably was a situation where 0.4 was like "imminent" whenthey made those all 0.1.0
[21:08:59] <ajpiano> and then it's still wasn't actually ready
[21:10:40] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, I committed with an inline style.
[21:11:35] <ajpiano> haha
[21:11:53] <ajpiano> just do another significant commit and have it mysteriously disappear
