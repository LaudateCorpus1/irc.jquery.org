[05:54:48] <sergez> Hey. I noticed the spam on the api.jquery.com repo. Seems like somebody doesn't like Arthur. What's up?
[05:55:09] <arthurvr> 6 months of repeated harassment :p 
[05:56:14] <sergez> 6 months? And GitHub is unable to do anything?
[05:56:45] <arthurvr> Dunno about ‚Äùunable‚Äù but they‚Äôre not doing anything more than deleting accounts‚Ä¶
[05:56:51] <sergez> wow this should change
[05:56:59] <arthurvr> yep
[05:58:12] <sergez> oh looks like it's way more today
[05:58:20] <sergez> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-dev/latest.log.html#t04:25:28
[05:58:25] <arthurvr> yeah last days have been the worst :(
[05:58:35] <sergez> so sorry to hear that arthurvr
[05:59:02] <sergez> really unfair and childish behaviour of who's doing this
[05:59:15] <arthurvr> Yeah, I know.
[06:00:35] <sergez> What you said this morning about not feeding the trolls is very important. I would suggest you to watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulNSlES1Fds
[06:01:42] <sergez> Comments like "waste of time" or "please stop" are only more of a waste of time and will result in even more trolling on the guys side and on the guys orgs.
[06:01:45] <arthurvr> Yeah, I know. Tell AurelioDeRosa :p 
[06:02:12] <arthurvr> So yeah, sorry for the spam. Just ignore it and move on :p 
[06:02:24] <arthurvr> GitHub is on it deleting stuff but it takes a while sometimes.
[06:03:28] <arthurvr> Not feeding him and blaming GitHub for not having some really basic protection is the only thing we can do.

[06:06:34] <sergez> arthurvr: Ok, keep your head up!
[06:06:46] <sergez> Just ignore the bad apples
[06:07:14] <arthurvr> With hunderds of issues a day sometimes that‚Äôs getting difficult.
[06:08:54] <sergez> Yeah, perfectly understandle. Just realize that the worst you can do to escalate is to comment things like thejameskyle and AurelioDeRosa did - Instead show ignorance, don't even close the issues yourself.
[06:09:19] <arthurvr> yep :)

[06:12:58] <AurelioDeRosa> sergez: Do you think that people like these will understand the difference between being ignored or being replied? That requires a certain amount of brain, which probably these people don't have.
[06:13:41] <sergez> They at least have the amount of brain to get more mad when you do those.
[06:13:42] <arthurvr> AurelioDeRosa: Yes, they do. I have previous examples of that too.
[06:14:16] <sergez> it's basically wasting time on both parties and feeding trolls makes things worse
[06:14:32] <AurelioDeRosa> Anyway, I'm fine with people disagreeing with me. We don't have to agree on everything.
[06:14:58] <arthurvr> That‚Äôs true, but this are repos we work on together.
[06:15:13] <arthurvr> So please don‚Äôt do those comments ;) Makes it worse for us all.
[06:16:00] <sergez> Are you now saying you disagree on that feeding the troll is a bad thing?
[06:16:52] <AurelioDeRosa> I disagree on the fact that leaving a simple comment is feeding the troll, plus it's funny how discussing a single comment is wasting way MORE time than the comment itself
[06:17:40] <arthurvr> AurelioDeRosa: We just want to prevent more future incidents, and leaving a comment is feeding the troll. He‚Äôs literally willing to get reaction, that‚Äôs where trolls are for.
[06:18:16] <AurelioDeRosa> I have a different idea on that.
[06:18:46] <AurelioDeRosa> Anyway, I have to go. Working time. See you.
[06:19:04] <arthurvr> Bye!
