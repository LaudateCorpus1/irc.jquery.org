[10:06:14] <kswedberg> ajpiano, btw (and just so I can tell someone, anyone): I'm going through all core API entries that have multiple types ( like http://api.jquery.com/prependto/ ) and fixing them.
[10:10:37] <kswedberg> ajpiano, you still there?

[10:27:05] <b-ot> ajpiano: @presjpolk: Wordpress includes non-GPL code: jQuery. Therefore Wordpress is incompatible with the Wordpress Foundation's software requirements.
[10:27:09] <ajpiano> who wants to reply to that
[10:28:18] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> I can.
[10:40:51] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: This guy is an idiot.
[10:41:19] <ajpiano> yea
[10:41:27] <ajpiano> he thinks he found like the big secret
[10:42:00] <ajpiano> and that somehow nacin and friends just missed this
[10:42:20] <scott_gonzalez> He's in fact very wrong about what he's reading.
[10:42:49] <scott_gonzalez> WordPress itself is GPL, but that means that GPL doesn't apply to 3rd party JS/CSS/etc.
[10:43:01] <scott_gonzalez> WordPress foundation likes EVERYTHING to be GPL compatible.
[10:43:30] <scott_gonzalez> What he's looking at is actually about WordCamps.
[10:43:40] <scott_gonzalez> If you distribute code, they want everything to be GPL compatible.
[10:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> Same as wordpress.org.
[10:44:05] <scott_gonzalez> So to say that jQuery doesn't meet that requirement is pretty dumb.
[10:44:17] <ajpiano> so i guess no one from jQuery is allowed to talk at wordcamp

[10:46:33] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: should we be using npm version for versioning jquery.com releases?
[10:46:48] <ajpiano> seems we've been having this special convention there of keeping the version matching the version of jquery
[10:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: yes
[10:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Every code site is doing that.
[10:47:17] <ajpiano> so what do i do, npm version patch would make jquery.com v1.9.2
[10:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> npm version build
[10:47:28] <ajpiano> blammmmmmmo
[10:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/tags
[10:47:51] <ajpiano> mehh
[10:48:00] <ajpiano> that made v1.9.0-6 :/
[10:48:02] <scott_gonzalez> You don't wnat to be managing thouse manually.
[10:48:10] <ajpiano> yeah, i'm with you on that
[10:48:15] <ajpiano> i just didn't know about npm version build :)
[10:48:22] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Sounds like someone didn't do the 1.9.1 release properly.
[10:48:32] <scott_gonzalez> PEOPLE, READ YOUR EMAIL!!!!!
[10:48:36] <ajpiano> :(
[10:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> All email sent to the entire team should be considered important.
[10:49:22] <ajpiano> ah yeah, package.json didn't get update
[10:49:39] <ajpiano> will fix that manually, then tag v1.9.0-1

[10:53:17] <DaveMethvin> that would be me ... so i need to add another manual step to my 23-step release process
[10:53:34] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: No, it's not manual.
[10:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> Just use `npm version {version-number}`.
[10:53:51] <DaveMethvin> so i don't have to type it?
[10:53:59] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I'm not familiar with this npm version thing.  in order to use npm version, should we install it globally?
[10:54:08] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you manually do that tagging?
[10:54:10] <ajpiano> kswedberg: it's part of npm
[10:54:12] <scott_gonzalez> You should script that :-P
[10:54:19] <kswedberg> ah. ok. 
[10:54:30] <scott_gonzalez> But anyway, just replace the part where you type `git tag x.y.z` and instead use `npm version x.y.z`
[10:55:15] <DaveMethvin> since the pages have been changing a lot, i don't have a script to edit the versions as they lie in the page yet
[10:55:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that makes sense.
[10:55:43] <DaveMethvin> i've had several but they keep getting broken
[10:55:44] <DaveMethvin> :D
[10:56:33] <ajpiano> yeah, we can probably add something for that into the gruntfile for jquery.com
[10:56:55] <ajpiano> and jquery-wp-content
[10:57:24] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: This guy is insane.
[10:57:57] <ajpiano> what the hell
[10:58:05] <ajpiano> he is accusing you of like, a lot of things
[10:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> https://twitter.com/presjpolk/status/299591955845902338
[10:58:07] <ajpiano> that don't make any sense
[10:58:07] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: @presjpolk: @scott_gonzalez In fact you'd better block me from Twitter lest you get infected by the selling code ffor money germs and get blackballed
[10:58:09] <ajpiano> shoulda had nacin reply
[10:58:30] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think nacin would've had better luck.
[10:59:36] <scott_gonzalez> This rule seems pretty simple: Want to promote something at WordCamp? It can't be proprietary.
[10:59:38] <DaveMethvin> why would someone let crazy stuff like that go on his Permanent Record?
[10:59:43] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[11:06:08] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like a good way to bow out of this conversation: https://twitter.com/scott_gonzalez/status/299594828012994560
[11:06:08] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: @scott_gonzalez: @presjpolk It's not about money, it's about freedom. If you disagree with WordPress Foundation's goals, don't distribute code at WordCamps.

[11:15:01] <ajpiano> i am not gonna bother tagging to fix that live, i just deployed manually, fyi
[11:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm... ajpiano, it's possible that we're not bound to GPL for jquery-wp-content.
[11:20:08] <ajpiano> that would be pretty rad
[11:20:22] <scott_gonzalez> "So a common misconception about the GPL is that, let's say I'm hired to make a theme for a client, does that theme fall under the GPL? The answer is "no" because it's not being distributed." - Matt Mullenweg
[11:20:45] <scott_gonzalez> ~5 minutes into http://wordpress.tv/2009/10/13/matt-mullenweg-wordpress-gpl/
[11:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> We'd need to find out what qualifies as distribution though.
[11:21:19] <ajpiano> right was just gonna say
[11:21:23] <rworth> I've wondered about that
[11:21:25] <ajpiano> depends on if what we're doing counts as distrubtion
[11:21:33] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we could make it MIT though, even if we don't fall under distrubition.
[11:21:38] <ajpiano> cause we are definitely putting it out there for everyone to have the source code
[11:21:47] <scott_gonzalez> But of course we don't want to make it MIT anyway.
[11:21:47] <ajpiano> but you explciitly AREN'T allowed to use it as your site theme
[11:21:52] <ajpiano> right, we dont' want mit
[11:22:04] <ajpiano> i've gotta go guys, got a hair app't
[11:22:07] <ajpiano> bbiab
[11:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, so I think we might be able to not do GPL, we should have Joel look into this.
[11:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> Or, rworth, do you want to ping Matt about it?
[11:23:24] <rworth> and it would just be copyright with no license?
[11:24:13] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[11:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> So the question is if we make that explicit (which we already do), but put the code on GitHub, is that kosher?
[11:29:49] <rworth> scott_gonzalez ok, I asked Matt
[11:29:56] <nacin> so
[11:30:44] <scott_gonzalez> Shower us with knowledge...
[11:33:51] <nacin> generally speaking what you are doing is "distribution"
[11:34:20] <nacin> the GPL technically requires that any derivatives are released also as GPL
[11:35:50] <nacin> in practice, we look the other way if derivatives are released as something like MIT. it is often possible to architect an application in such a way that only some of it constitutes a derivative (and, often, plugins are not derivative; themes typically always are). given PHP is not compiled, the courts of law have not entirely tested the whole interpretive code thing, etc.
[11:36:23] <nacin> if you wanted to release the whole thing as MIT, I (as the major code contributor for the GPL-d bits here) am not going to strongly object.
[11:36:41] <nacin> I am however curious why not being bound to the GPL helps you, or is "rad".
[11:36:48] <rworth> actually scott_gonzalez's talking about going the other way. not MIT but no license
[11:36:53] <nacin> the guy on twitter is wrong and crazy. and wrong. also, crazy.
[11:37:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, he is very wrong and very crazy.
[11:37:48] <rworth> that is, all our other repos are MIT and this one repo wouldn't have any license whatsoever. People would be able to contribute changes to it, but that's it
[11:38:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, the idea is that this is our proprietary theme.
[11:38:58] <scott_gonzalez> However, I think it's probably beneficial to have the PHP be GPL as we're not really concerned with others reusing it.
[11:39:31] <nacin> A) I don't see why you would not want to no-license the PHP aspects of this application. B) I would have a strong objection to that, because what I basically built in jquery-wp-content is the first-ever WordPress "distro" (akin to Drupal's distros) and I want it to serve a basis for future development in this area. C) I think you guys are getting too worked up over someone stealing your site designs.
[11:40:28] <rworth> nacin good points. I'm excited about B
[11:40:29] <nacin> D) I don't see what the problem is with the existing split-three-ways license on in the readme. Legally, practically, or otherwise. Aside from the split-three-ways part.
[11:40:33] <rworth> and thanks again :D
[11:40:56] <nacin> hey, no problem. happy to help.
[11:41:17] <scott_gonzalez> The community confusion about the license split is what is annoying.
[11:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> But I do think that what we have in place today is the ideal in terms of actual rights.
[11:42:43] <buzzedword> I'm curious-- trying to publish a plugin that has a build process behind it, which puts the plugin into it's own lib folder. The spec says the manifest has to exist at the root level, with the plugin as well.
[11:43:20] <buzzedword> So in order to publish a thoroughly built plugin, I need to dupe my lib/*.js file to the root, and break an established practice to follow jquery's?
[11:43:29] <rworth> buzzedword only the location of the manifest file is mandated
[11:43:41] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: if "the community" consists of neil stevens, I laugh.
[11:43:43] <buzzedword> rworth: so I can keep my lib/*.js
[11:43:58] <rworth> yeah buzzedword you can have any folder structure you want
[11:44:11] <buzzedword> Think I may have missed that in the docs. I'll re-read vs bugging you guys. Thank you!
[11:44:27] <rworth> do let us know if any clarification is needed
[11:44:33] <buzzedword> Will do
[11:46:26] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: also, to clarify, the rule neil linked to is simply a guideline to which we hold WordCamp organizers, speakers, and sponsors.
[11:47:34] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Yup, unlike Neil, I was able to read and understand that page :-)
[11:48:02] <nacin> 80% of attendees are going to listen to whatever gets preached from the altar. we want to make sure the right people are on stage, who properly represent the community.
[11:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, the guidelines on that page make sense.
[11:48:28] <scott_gonzalez> And that logic is clearly expressed on that page.

[14:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I was wondering how that would even work.
[14:14:27] <gnarf> like i think it pushes the sha anyway --- think about ui release
[14:15:18] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[14:15:30] <gnarf> hrm
[14:16:58] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/ajpiano/5a2b5856883b4326dd4e
[14:17:04] <ajpiano> nothing abnormal happened
[14:17:40] <ajpiano> a different weird thing happened to me with contribute around the same time
[14:19:09] <ajpiano> https://gist.github.com/ajpiano/94bb45177b8b14f6efad
[14:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...Maybe the ref doesn't exist as a SHA ref if you don't push.
[14:19:22] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe it only exists as the tag ref.
[14:19:26] <ajpiano> npm version like, straight up didn't work
[14:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> That wouldn't really make sense though.
[14:19:30] <ajpiano> until i ran it again, and it did
[14:20:34] <scott_gonzalez> That error from contribute is because package.json was behind.
[14:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> package.json had 1.0.0 but there was already a v1.0.1 tag.
[14:21:07] <scott_gonzalez> So when you ran `npm version patch`, it updated package.json and then tried to tag with v1.0.1 and failed.
[14:21:28] <scott_gonzalez> When you did it again, it updated package.json and tried to tag with v1.0.2 and succeeded.
[14:21:36] <ajpiano> oh, gotcha
[14:22:02] <scott_gonzalez> Still not sure what caused the plugin fail though.
[14:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna test something out
[14:22:20] <scott_gonzalez> But first I need to start making dinner.
[14:22:30] <ajpiano> cool
[14:22:40] <ajpiano> yea i didn't do 1.0.1 of contribute so that's probably why that happened
[14:26:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What command to do you use for site updates? `git fetch --tags` or `git fetch && git fetch --tags`?
[14:27:53] <scott_gonzalez> nevermind, I see it in the email
[14:29:36] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, `git push --tags` before `git push` is the problem.
[14:30:03] <scott_gonzalez> And the reason it's a problem is because the update script uses `git fetch origin` and doesn't use `--tags`
[14:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> Mystery solved.
[14:31:47] <gnarf> can u make me an issue to do fetch and fetch --tags ?
[14:31:52] <gnarf> we gotta make sure of that
[14:32:10] <gnarf> i'll forget by the time i get to it
[14:32:12] <gnarf> :)
[14:32:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok

[17:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: The grunt-build branch looks good, though there are some regressions from master.
[17:41:01] <scott_gonzalez> Check out the header in the download box on the jqueryui.com homepage.

[17:49:14] <gnarf> waterfall!!!
[17:59:42] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: that's the problem
[17:59:45] <ajpiano> i can't build jqueryui.com locally :/
[18:00:05] <ajpiano> i haven't tried in a little while, let me see if it fails
[18:05:24] <ajpiano> no dice, same blowup as usual
[18:05:39] <ajpiano> maybe i should just take build-download out for now :p
[18:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[18:12:25] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i can take the "window" off the location
[18:12:41] <ajpiano> i had fixed that before adding browser: true to the .jshintrc
[18:12:55] <ajpiano> however, it still doesn't like a naked alert
[18:13:15] <ajpiano> we can either add "alert" as a global
[18:13:31] <ajpiano> or just leave the window there
[18:13:53] <ajpiano> considering that this is like basically debug code for stripe that isn't finished yet, and we don't use alerts
[18:14:02] <ajpiano> i figure we should jsut leave window on
[18:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[18:14:08] <ajpiano> also cause i hate calling alert globally
[18:14:26] <ajpiano> and if you were curious, i put the use strict; cause i forgot that was fixed in 0.4
