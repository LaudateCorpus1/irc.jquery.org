[08:13:33] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: so I think we can close https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/657#issuecomment-142633792
[08:14:25] <agcolom> sorry I mean the issue, not the comment :-)
[08:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> That's my preference.
[08:14:39] <arthurvr> Me too, was just doing that now.
[08:14:41] <agcolom> sounds good to me. 
[08:14:48] <agcolom> cool :-) thanks
[08:15:09] <scott_gonzalez> :-)

[08:17:38] <arthurvr> That said, I think there are actually some troubles with that section. Besides from listing up some common bottlenecks I think it should show people more how to measure the things that actually do matter.
[08:18:44] <arthurvr> Ugh that last comment btw
[08:21:29] <arthurvr> Like how to make reliable benchmarks, and why jsperfs like that are useless.
[08:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> I never said the content was good.
[08:23:47] <scott_gonzalez> Just that looping was not the bottleneck.
[08:24:08] <arthurvr> Sure totally agree
[08:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> I think there's a lot of content that needs to change on that site.
