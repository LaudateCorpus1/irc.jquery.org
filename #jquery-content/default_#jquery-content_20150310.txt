[13:26:07] <jzaefferer> aluka: alright. That's a project of the content team. Since you're already here, I'll defer further questions about the interactive tutorials to agcolom and arthurvr
[13:26:38] <arthurvr> Hey aluka! Did you have questions?
[13:27:50] <aluka> hey arthurvr , i liked the project and have doubt that should i give a demo for this project ?
[13:29:44] <aluka> so how should i start for this and to whom should i send my idea of doing this project ?
[13:32:58] <arthurvr> agcolom is the mentor for that project. Be sure to start at https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students, if you didnâ€™t read that already.
