[03:29:29] <agcolom> django_ Hi, yes this is the right place. I'll be around between 1 and 4pm GMT today.
[11:00:13] <django_> agcolom, Hello im interested in the GSOC 2016: jQuery Learning Center - Interactive tutorials for learn and other sites
[11:01:13] <agcolom> Hi django_, great news :-)
[11:01:14] <agcolom> what is your timezone?
[11:01:17] <django_> agcolom, EST
[11:01:40] <agcolom> ok. I'm in London, UK so I'm 5h ahead of you.
[11:01:47] <django_> right
[11:02:54] <agcolom> so this is a project we proposed last year, but as we only got 3 slots as an organisation, we had to prioritise the projects and we didn't give this one a top 3 priority. 
[11:03:52] <django_> ahh I see
[11:03:56] <agcolom> We're hoping that we'll get more than 3 this year, plus I'm really keen on getting this project a higher priority this year as the content team is shrinking, and it needs a good boost
[11:03:59] <django_> mhm which are top priority this year?
[11:04:23] <agcolom> I'll fight for it to be top of the list
[11:05:00] <agcolom> Also, it was our 1st year as an organisation (hence the 3 slots only)
[11:05:26] <agcolom> All our projects last year were successful, so we're hoping we'll get more this year
[11:06:47] <django_> Which projects will be on top of the list this year?
[11:06:57] <agcolom> I'll be co-mentoring with zz_AurelioDeRosa (I'll be helping with the UX and pedagogic aspects and Aurelio with the technical aspects)
[11:08:42] <agcolom> I want this one to be. All our projects are listed at https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2016-Ideas-List
[11:09:00] <agcolom> This is why as the content team, we've only proposed 1 project
[11:30:23] <django_> agcolom, its mainly coding a jquery tutorial?
[11:30:34] <django_> i love writing tutorials but i also want to have programming in my portfiolio
[11:30:45] <django_> all i have is practice right now on: github.com/jk16
[11:35:44] <agcolom> django_: yes we currently have some tutorials on the lerning center, but you cannot interact with the code, etc.
[11:36:59] <agcolom> so we're looking at having interactive tutorials, where students/users could get exercises to test their understanding
[11:38:05] <agcolom> here's some discussion we had about this: https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/641
[15:14:53] <django_> agcolom, ill do whatever it takes to get this :s
[16:04:06] <agcolom> django_: fantastic :-)
[16:35:10] <django_> agcolom, what do you teach in MENG?
[16:37:23] <agcolom> I teach level 4, 5, 6 (which corresponds to 1st, 2nd and 3rd y) as follows: 
[16:37:46] <agcolom> 1st year: Web technology (html, css, JavaScript)
[16:38:52] <agcolom> 2nd y advanced client-side Web development (advanced topics in html5, css3, JavaScript, jQuery, media queries, etc
[16:39:11] <agcolom> level 6 mobile UX using jQuery Mobile :-)
[16:39:22] <agcolom> to develop mobile web applications.
[16:40:01] <agcolom> I used to also do half of Mobile Computing Principles 2nd y with jQuery Mobile, XML, XSLT
[16:41:03] <django_> ahh neat
[16:41:07] <agcolom> The M year is mainly a large project with other modules taught by my colleagues
[16:41:25] <agcolom> thx :-)
[16:46:17] <django_> agcolom, so its not 100% sure that the learning center project will be chosen for gsoc 2016 right
[16:49:34] <agcolom> django_: That's right. I can't promise it will because at this stage we don't know how many projects will be give by Google
[16:49:47] <agcolom> given
[16:49:53] <django_> agcolom, is it wise for me to wait until the projects are released?
[16:51:39] <agcolom> you can start working on a proposal if you like or getting some ideas down
