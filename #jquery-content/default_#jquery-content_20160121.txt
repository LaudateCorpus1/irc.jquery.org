[15:06:38] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: what is the latest with signing the CLA. Someone with little experience who only has a username in their github account creates a PR. If they sign the CLA with the correct email address and their name, will the CLA check fail? 
[15:06:58] <agcolom> matching email but not matching names
[15:07:05] <agcolom> name vs username
[15:08:51] <agcolom> it seems to me the easiest is for them to update their GH details with their names, close the PR, create a new PR (in this case it's a PR to change one word).
[15:09:05] <agcolom> and of course sign the CLA. 
[15:09:19] <agcolom> what do you think? 
[15:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> usernames have no meaning for the CLA
[15:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> GH has no meaning eitehr.
[15:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing that matters is the author info in the git commit.

[15:10:59] <agcolom> they did
[15:11:07] <agcolom> (patch-1_
[15:11:26] <agcolom> patch-1 
[15:12:40] <agcolom> this is why I'm thinking that this would be the easiest for them to do...
