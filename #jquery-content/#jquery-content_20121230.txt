[08:40:52] <agcolom> hello, just trying to see if there is someone around... 
[08:51:19] <agcolom> ajpiano: hello, I am more or less ready to upload a short tutorial on how to use the jQuery Mobile ThemeRoller. However, I have some images to upload as well, so I'd like to do it when you are around to be sure that I am not breaking everything ;-) When is a good time for you?
[08:54:30] <ajpiano> agcolom: is it working in a local deploy
[08:54:38] <ajpiano> ?
[08:59:37] <agcolom> ajpiano: hi! 
[08:59:47] <ajpiano> heya
[09:00:08] <agcolom> I'm not sure I'm setup for a local to work... Can I try to just do grunt?
[09:00:20] <ajpiano> yeah, and set up your config.json
[09:00:28] <ajpiano> it works the same as api site and anything else
[09:01:17] <agcolom> but I always do grunt deploy even for the api site, as this is how my config.json was setup!
[09:01:38] <agcolom> ( scott_gonzalez screamed when he found out!)
[09:01:47] <ajpiano> you deploy directly to staging for the api site?
[09:01:52] <agcolom> yes
[09:01:56] <ajpiano> :/
[09:02:03] <agcolom> indeed ;-)
[09:02:04] <ajpiano> you don't have a local wordpress setup?
[09:02:14] <agcolom> no, I don't think so
[09:03:17] <agcolom> I am not sure actually. I had a long skype meeting with Richard to set this up and I was following his instructions) 
[09:03:38] <ajpiano> hmm
[09:03:41] <ajpiano> you should find out
[09:04:03] <agcolom> how can I find out ? (is it easy?)
[09:04:32] <ajpiano>  if you go to local.api.jquerymobile.com
[09:04:38] <ajpiano> or any of the sites with local.* instead of stage*
[09:04:45] <ajpiano> or maybe dev.*, i don't know hwen you set it up
[09:05:47] <ajpiano> i feel like it's something you'd know :p
[09:06:09] <agcolom> no sign of local. or dev. anything...
[09:06:39] <ajpiano> hrm
[09:06:39] <ajpiano> well
[09:06:49] <ajpiano> if you are feeling enterprising on a sunday, now would be a good time to get set up
[09:07:03] <agcolom> ok, 
[09:07:07] <ajpiano> deploying directly to the staging site every time you make a change is sub-optimal :p
[09:07:29] <ajpiano> however if you want to see if the learn change works you can deploy to stage for now, if you want
[09:08:05] <agcolom> ok. I just need to check with you how to do the images...
[09:08:43] <agcolom> is it like this: ![picture alt](/resources/jquery-mobile/Theme1.png "Default colors theme example")
[09:09:10] <ajpiano> the last paren is in the wrong place
[09:09:21] <ajpiano> but otherwise i think yes
[09:09:28] <ajpiano> this is obviously the advantage of having a local set up :
[09:09:28] <ajpiano> :p
[09:09:38] <agcolom> yes, it would help ;-)
[09:10:10] <agcolom> so the image title doesn't go inside the parenthesis?
[09:11:08] <ajpiano> ohh i didn't realise that syntax existed
[09:11:11] <ajpiano> apparently it does, lolo
[09:15:25] <agcolom> ok, so I have theme-roller.md inside jquery-mobile
[09:16:16] <ajpiano> ok
[09:17:00] <agcolom> so I create a resources folder in learn.jquery.com
[09:17:18] <agcolom> then jquery-mobile in that folder and I put my images there...
[09:17:58] <ajpiano> i think so
[09:18:06] <ajpiano> i'd have to test locally to be sure :p
[09:21:34] <agcolom> I have added theme-roller to order.yml
[09:22:10] <agcolom> do we need to add something to pickup resources** (for the images)?
[09:22:17] <ajpiano> i don't think so
[09:22:30] <agcolom> so I can try to commit and push?
[09:22:36] <ajpiano> i feel like if you're gonna deploy to stage to test, you may as well deploy to stage to test :p
[09:22:41] <ajpiano> you don't have to commit or push to deploy
[09:22:52] <ajpiano> you just can deploy to stage
[09:22:55] <agcolom> really?
[09:23:06] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:23:10] <ajpiano> if you just do grunt deploy
[09:23:25] <ajpiano> it deploys whatever files are there in their current state, it doesn't care about what is committed or not
[09:24:49] <agcolom> ok. I'm doing a pull and now npm install... (I was quite a bit behind with the versions there)
[09:26:55] <agcolom> right I do not have config.json in that repo, so I guess that's why last time (and the only time) I did a commit and push
[09:28:20] <ajpiano> for every site you copy config-sample.json
[09:28:24] <ajpiano> and make config.json
[09:28:26] <ajpiano> with the real details
[09:28:34] <agcolom> ok, thanks
[09:28:46] <ajpiano> should be the same as the api.jquerymobile.com details for login/pw but use the stage.learn.jquery.com url
[09:30:09] <agcolom> ok... moment of truth coming soon ;-)
[09:30:13] <ajpiano> hehe
[09:31:33] <ajpiano> even without a local install of a site
[09:31:36] <ajpiano> you should grunt anyway
[09:31:43] <ajpiano> it will run some local checks
[09:31:54] <agcolom> well, it's not too bad... I've got a small problem with the images...
[09:32:14] <agcolom> yes, that's a good compromise until I have a proper local setup ;-)
[09:32:44] <ajpiano> oh well at least they are pathed correctly and displaying
[09:33:24] <agcolom> Looks like one of my image is a bit too big, and another one is weird... maybe my fault... I'll check...
[09:33:41] <agcolom> So when I'm happy with how it looks, can I then commit and push?
[09:33:50] <ajpiano> yep
[09:34:00] <agcolom> fantastic ;-) Thank you so much :-)
[09:34:11] <agcolom> hope you had a good Xmas and lots of nice presents ;-)
[09:34:14] <ajpiano> hehe indeed
[09:34:16] <ajpiano> welcome :)
