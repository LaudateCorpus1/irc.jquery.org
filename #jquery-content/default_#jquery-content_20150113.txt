[05:42:16] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez re: https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/87/files#r22805639 . It looks like most of the PR is copy/pasted from other style guides. As such, it's probably a good start.
[05:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> It's copy pasted from learn.jquery.com.
[05:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> So it's a good start, but there have been at least a dozen glaring problems because it was learn specific.
[05:43:08] <kswedberg> Might be worthwhile to merge the pull request, commit locally, and then commit fixes on top of it before pushing.
[05:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, Arthur pinged me yesterday and said the exact same thing to me.
[05:43:32] <kswedberg> What same thing?
[05:43:34] <scott_gonzalez> He asked how to nicely tell this guy that he's not the right person.
[05:44:41] <scott_gonzalez> The problem with it being a good start, is that it's no so terrible that we just close it outright, but it's also a huge pain trying to get him to finish it properly.
[05:45:20] <kswedberg> Ah. How hard would it be to merge, commit fixes, and push? He doesn't have to finish it. I'd be willing to do that this weekend.
[05:46:24] <kswedberg> What's the downside of that approach? 
[05:46:29] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez?
[05:47:08] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the downside would be bad info in the repo.
[05:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> Between the first commit and the fix commit.
[05:48:04] <scott_gonzalez> TBH, you may be better off just starting over, since I don't think he actually wrote any content at all.
[05:48:14] <scott_gonzalez> He just removed stuff after being told that it was wrong for the general style guide.
[05:48:24] <kswedberg> ok, I can take a stab at it.

[12:16:43] <ryanneufeld> is the irc.jquery.com index page in one of the content repos?
[12:16:47] <ryanneufeld> I can't seem to find it
[12:16:58] <ryanneufeld> it looks like it might be a static html file though
[12:17:24] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/irc.jquery.org isnâ€™t it?
[12:18:09] <arthurvr> the theming is in jquery-wp-content
[12:18:19] <ryanneufeld> derp
[12:18:21] <ryanneufeld> thanks
[12:18:28] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/tree/master/themes/irc.jquery.org
[12:21:47] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[12:21:54] <ryanneufeld> I can't see where the left nav comes from
[12:22:11] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/themes/irc.jquery.org/sidebar.php
[12:22:15] <arthurvr> you mean https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/themes/irc.jquery.org/sidebar.php
[12:22:22] <arthurvr> hey arschmitz was faster
[12:22:29] <ryanneufeld> tf
[12:22:33] <ryanneufeld> why is that in wp-content...
[12:22:36] <ryanneufeld> *sigh
[12:22:49] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: well in wordpress terms this is theme
[12:23:12] <arthurvr> yeah all themes are in there
[12:23:13] <arschmitz> and themes need to be in jquery-wp-content
[12:24:23] <arthurvr> why are we handling the nav like this?
[12:24:39] <arthurvr> I do kinda agree that it in fact should be in irc.jquery.org repo
[12:24:46] <arthurvr> such as with meetings.jquery.org
[12:24:52] <arthurvr> like this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/themes/meetings.jquery.org/sidebar.php#L5
[12:25:20] <arschmitz> arthurvr: no idea ask scott_gonzalez
[12:26:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what you're asking.
[12:27:00] <scott_gonzalez> Why is the channel list in jquery-wp-content instead of in irc.jquery.org?
[12:27:35] <ryanneufeld> yes
[12:27:37] <ryanneufeld> that's part of it
[12:27:44] <ryanneufeld> also for my PR
[12:27:48] <ryanneufeld> what component is this?
[12:28:23] <scott_gonzalez> irc.jquery.org
[12:28:28] <arthurvr> mostly we use the name of the site itself
[12:28:52] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/5ead1388f79144c10d36 
[12:29:02] <ryanneufeld> like that?
[12:29:08] <scott_gonzalez> The ref is wrong.
[12:29:16] <scott_gonzalez> Fixes jquery/irc.jquery.org#15
[12:29:26] <ryanneufeld> ffs
[12:29:34] <ryanneufeld> I'm following the contrib guide
[12:29:54] <scott_gonzalez> The contrib guide is correct.
[12:30:04] <scott_gonzalez> You're fixing an issue in a different repo.
[12:30:18] <ryanneufeld> right
[12:30:23] <arthurvr> also: <li><a href="/%23pep/">#jquerymobile-dev</a></li>
[12:30:27] <arthurvr> isnâ€™t correct right?
[12:30:33] <ryanneufeld> nope
[12:30:38] <ryanneufeld> I would have caught that :p
[12:30:55] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably alphabetize the list.
[12:31:06] <scott_gonzalez> But for sure the defunct channel shouldn't be in the middle.
[12:31:27] <ryanneufeld> then it's not alphabetized is it
[12:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'm saying the active channels should probably be alphabetized instead of in essentially random order.
[12:32:19] <scott_gonzalez> There's really no order to what we have right now.
[12:34:08] <ryanneufeld> ok
[12:34:23] <ryanneufeld> I'll make another aside section for defunct channels
[12:36:59] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/275117034436477d18d8 
[12:37:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that we should have "Defunct Logs" in a sidebar heading.
[12:37:50] <scott_gonzalez> Also, g comes before j
[12:38:05] <ryanneufeld> I'm a dev, not a librarian :p
[12:38:09] <ryanneufeld> I'll fix that
[12:38:17] <ryanneufeld> how do you wanna handle the defunct ones then?
[12:38:30] <ryanneufeld> "Channels not in use"
[12:38:30] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps an h4 inside the existing aside for Inactive Channels or Old Channels or something
[12:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> We also don't need the parenthetical once there's a header.
[12:39:27] <ryanneufeld> Why?
[12:39:33] <ryanneufeld> it's still valid information
[12:40:00] <scott_gonzalez> The fact that it's inactive is already known because of the new header.
[12:40:14] <scott_gonzalez> The fact that jQuery Mobile discussion is in #jqueryui-dev is already known because of the index page.
[12:40:32] <ryanneufeld> okay
[12:40:37] <ryanneufeld> here's what i'm gonna do
[12:40:47] <ryanneufeld> I'm gonna put in the list, in alphabetical order
[12:40:52] <ryanneufeld> and you can sort it out later
