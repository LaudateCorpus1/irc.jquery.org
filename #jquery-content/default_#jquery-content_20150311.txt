[05:52:28] <jzaefferer> arthurvr: in general we assume that commiters merge their own PRs, regarding https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/105#issuecomment-78254384
[05:53:25] <arthurvr> jzaefferer: Yeah perfectly fine :D Was just asking because you might not have the time atm.
[05:55:28] <jzaefferer> arthurvr: would you use the "@" between QUnit version and useragent or a semicolon (QUnit 1.7.2; Mozilla ...)
[05:55:35] <jzaefferer> arthurvr: regarding https://github.com/jquery/qunit/pull/768#issuecomment-78180174
[05:58:08] <arthurvr> jzaefferer: No idea, honestly. The @ is mostly used to indicate the version of something tho, like `npm install package@version`.
[05:59:00] <arthurvr> jzaefferer: ‚ÄùA semicolon can be used between two closely related independent clauses‚Äù (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semicolon)
[05:59:14] <arthurvr> jzaefferer: So maybe I‚Äôd prefer a semicolon. dunno
[05:59:40] <jzaefferer> arthurvr: yeah, that sounds like an argument for the semicolon. Could use QUnit@1.7.2, but a space works fine there
[06:00:01] <arthurvr> Yeah sure. Space works fine in there.

[06:34:31] <jacquerie> Mh, is it expected that the website developed for https://github.com/jquery/content/issues/4 uses the WordPress-based technology described in http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/?
[06:57:08] <agcolom> jacquerie: as the idea here is to build a tool, I would not expect it be part of one of our websites. 
[06:58:44] <agcolom> cc: scott_gonzalez, would that be ok with you, or would you want the issue tracker to be part of our wp-based websites?
[06:59:53] <scott_gonzalez> I imagine a properly designed tool would be easy to incorporate into our sites.
[07:00:09] <scott_gonzalez> What we should really be concerned with is what infrastructure would prefer.

[07:03:27] <gnarf> Indifference, though I would prefer something php/node vs something ruby/java/python/others
[07:03:48] <gnarf> because we have mostly php/node services, and we are pretty comfortable maintaining those and have the expertise
[07:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> I believe the proposal was an Express app, so that would be fine.

[08:08:10] <sigorilla> Hello! I have a question about jQuery Learning Center for GSoC. Should I make a complete framework - a working system with ability to make study courses which would be easy to use by teachers (admins) and would give a full learning experience, including lectures (articles) and tasks (courses) for checking? Should this framework be plugin for jQuery theme on WordPress or independent?

[10:32:12] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: looks like this usage example is copy&pasta: https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-spider#usage-examples
[10:32:40] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: heh yeah i need to update the read me on that i never finished writing it
[10:33:01] <arschmitz> aits mostly now just going to point at https://www.npmjs.com/package/spider.js its the same options
[11:26:37] <sigorilla> I haven't received a reply to my question, so I repeate it.
[11:26:45] <sigorilla> I'm interested in jQuery Learning Center (interactive tutorials) for GSoC. Should I make a complete framework - a working system with ability to make study courses which would be easy to use by teachers (admins) and would give a full learning experience, including lectures (articles) and tasks (courses) for checking? Should this framework be plugin for jQuery theme on WordPress or independent?
[11:26:59] <arthurvr> cc agcolom ^
[11:27:50] <agcolom> sigorilla: Yes, ideally it would plugin in to the learning center (learn.jquery.com)
[11:28:58] <agcolom> the idea is that it would provide a full learning experience, which articles/lectures and a tutorial to test the acquired knowledge
[11:29:22] <agcolom> the lecture could be an article but also a short video
[11:30:17] <agcolom> the system should be able to provide hints
[11:30:34] <agcolom> and detect if the tutorial was successfully completed
[11:30:50] <agcolom> if not, it should say what is wrong/missing
[11:30:56] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: What does "A string that will be used to create a regex for excluding urls from being spidered." mean?
[11:31:04] <scott_gonzalez> Is it escaped? Is it actually a regex?
[11:31:26] <scott_gonzalez> Is the example of `ignore: "error.html"` actually searching for "error" anything "html"?
[11:31:35] <scott_gonzalez> Or is that converted to /error\.html/?
[11:31:49] <arschmitz> new RegExp( "string" );
[11:31:55] <arschmitz> thats a terrible example
[11:32:02] <scott_gonzalez> ah, great
[11:32:02] <agcolom> I'll create an issue with requirements
[11:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> You might consider changing that API.
[11:33:14] <scott_gonzalez> Does that prevent the spider from following a link to that page or does it stop it from following links once on that page?
[11:33:55] <sigorilla> Hm, tasks should be in the articles?
[11:34:17] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: stops it from going to that page
[11:34:25] <scott_gonzalez> perfect
[11:35:04] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i use it on jqueryui demos for example because we have intentional 404's
[11:35:11] <arschmitz> same thing in mobile
[11:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> We'll also want it on anything that is intentionally redirecting.
[11:35:39] <arschmitz> yup
[11:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> Like a bit.ly URL that we use for tracking.
[11:35:53] <arschmitz> yup
[11:36:03] <scott_gonzalez> Or in the case that I just came across link.packtpub.com.
[11:36:07] <sigorilla> agcolom, Ok, an issue will be great. Thanks!
[11:36:22] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: yeah there are some packt ones on jqueryui
[11:36:32] <arschmitz> i have ben meaning to ask about actually
[11:37:27] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: im open to any suggestions or api improvments for sure too
