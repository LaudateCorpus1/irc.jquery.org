[07:03:53] <ctwx> Hey guys, I just wanted to tell you, that urls in the CDN example code on jquery.com/download are missing the http.
[07:11:05] <arschmitz> ctwx: no thats intentional
[07:11:16] <arschmitz> ctwx: they are protocol relative 
[07:12:34] <arschmitz> ctwx: this is standard google does the same https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide they will work just as is 
[07:12:42] <ctwx> how embarassing. I didn't know of protocol relative urls. I'll do some research. I thought it's an error.
[07:12:53] <arschmitz> ctwx: no problem
