[09:27:21] <ajpiano>  worth perusing the comments here: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5021241
[09:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> I fucking hate the world
[09:34:05] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/2l0Y2N3Y2Z0Z
[09:34:10] <scott_gonzalez> WTF? They're EXACTLY THE SAME
[09:34:11] <scott_gonzalez> Dick
[09:34:26] <ajpiano> hahah yeah
[09:34:27] <ajpiano> i saw that
[09:34:43] <ajpiano> the vertical space is def something that concerns me
[09:34:47] <ajpiano> it has always felt a little "big"
[09:35:24] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: what are you thoughts on outward-strategy for this week re: sites
[09:35:46] <ajpiano> should i say anything about how "api site is just a sneak preview, we're glad to hear your feedback" kind of thing
[09:36:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, say something like we'll be rolling out several sites over the next few weeks. Expect changes and improvements over time.
[09:36:54] <scott_gonzalez> Let them know we're listening.
[09:36:57] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/155
[09:37:01] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/154
[09:37:44] <ajpiano> sweet scott_gonzalez
[09:39:33] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I'm always willing to read through a pile of flaming comments to find the actual value.
[09:39:40] <ajpiano> heh yeah
[09:39:50] <ajpiano> i can scan an HN thread like that for useful stuff
[09:39:53] <ajpiano> in no time
[09:39:59] <ajpiano> the noise just filtrs out
[09:40:06] <scott_gonzalez> I think I once read through a several page David Mark rant to pull out valid complaints for John once.
[09:40:37] <scott_gonzalez> John was like "I'm pretty sure there's some useful info in here, but I can't read it."
[09:40:42] <ajpiano> haha
[09:42:51] <ajpiano> now, to actually comment in the HN thread?
[09:43:48] <ajpiano> this one gets me http://cl.ly/image/2j373K402v2N
[09:44:05] <DaveMethvin> yah ajpiano slow as shit!
[09:44:18] <DaveMethvin> that's hacker news for ya
[09:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it has been really slow recently.
[09:44:56] <DaveMethvin> compared to trac? :D
[09:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/2U0X0A1V3Y2Z
[09:46:07] <DaveMethvin> damn base.css
[09:46:25] <ajpiano> when do you all guys want to have our little checkin meeting? DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez danheberden rworth ?
[09:46:38] <ajpiano> hrm, those are really high latencies
[09:46:50] <ajpiano> (i think)
[09:47:12] <DaveMethvin> yeah and 64kb isn't THAT big
[09:47:21] <ajpiano> though we should be serving minified css if we can
[09:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you can't see in that screenshot.
[09:47:45] <danheberden> ajpiano: whenevs - you and i have the same time obligation for work so whatever works for you works for me
[09:47:53] <ajpiano> cool
[09:48:05] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: see what?
[09:48:11] <scott_gonzalez> I sometimes get 2+ second latency.
[09:48:11] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: also when do you want to connect on syntax highlight stuff
[09:48:23] <ajpiano> oh danggg
[09:48:29] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1X0Q0k2g162G
[09:48:59] <danheberden> latency is our way of helping people to take time out of their busy days to reflect on the quality of their life
[09:49:08] <DaveMethvin> meditation
[09:49:22] <DaveMethvin> here i'm seeing 454ms for the html
[09:49:30] <ajpiano> yeah i'm having nearly a secodn a lot just on the ninitial req
[09:49:34] <DaveMethvin> i think the site's just being hammered
[09:49:52] <DaveMethvin> also combined/compressed css and js would help
[09:50:24] <ajpiano> so would spriting our images
[09:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Yup, we can start looking at that once we get new-css live.
[09:50:36] <ajpiano> we make you dl every site's logo onevery site
[09:50:40] <ajpiano> but yeah, first things first :)
[09:51:11] <scott_gonzalez> I want minification + concatenation to be high priority after the sites launch.
[09:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> And once we have a build step, we can look at pre-processing CSS.
[09:51:51] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: GMTA
[09:52:10] <DaveMethvin> yep
[09:53:43] <ajpiano> rworth is coming to the computer right now, seems like we're all around
[09:53:48] <ajpiano> if we all want to have a quick skype?
[09:53:53] <DaveMethvin> yeah worksforme
[09:55:40] <ajpiano> danheberden: can you hop on skype?
[09:57:21] <ajpiano> https://twitter.com/jeremypharo/status/288322666862088192
[09:57:45] <danheberden> ajpiano: hopping
[10:44:57] <danheberden> ajpiano: where are the top nav items declared?
[10:45:16] <danheberden> like in learn.jquery.com, the `home, about, contributing, style guide`
[10:45:23] <ajpiano> themes/jquery/menu-header.php
[10:46:25] <danheberden> instead of in each theme?
[10:46:27] <danheberden> interesting
[10:46:31] <danheberden> thanks! :)
[10:47:05] <ajpiano> yah
[10:47:43] <ajpiano> be careful cause the jquery.com one is the default for all the sites that don'thave their own specified :D
[10:49:01] <scott_gonzalez> It actually walks the site URL until it finds a match.
[10:49:18] <danheberden> oh, wat
[10:49:27] <danheberden> ajpiano: that's gonna be a problem
[10:49:39] <danheberden> we don't need "download guide" on every site
[10:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: We can just add more sites to that list.
[10:50:30] <scott_gonzalez> So for learn.jquery.com, it checks if menu_header_learn_jquery_com() exists.
[10:50:40] <scott_gonzalez> If it doesn't, it drops the subdomain and checks again.
[10:50:50] <scott_gonzalez> So it would fall back to menu_header_jquery_com().
[10:50:50] <danheberden> yeah - can we just make a "jquery" default that isn't jquery.com?
[10:51:05] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: that part is what i assumed when adam said it defaults to jquery.com
[10:51:11] <danheberden> if one isn't specified
[10:51:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm 99% sure ajpiano is wrong about there being a default.
[10:51:32] <danheberden> "So it would fall back to menu_header_jquery_com()."
[10:51:34] <danheberden> sounds like a default
[10:51:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, he's wrong.
[10:51:48] <ajpiano> what an a hole
[10:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> if ( function_exists( $func ) )
[10:51:51] <scott_gonzalez> 	jquery_render_menu( call_user_func( $func ) );
[10:51:57] <scott_gonzalez> There's no else.
[10:52:02] <danheberden> ok.
[10:52:11] <danheberden> then yay!
[10:52:23] <scott_gonzalez> My guess is that he saw learn fall back to menu_header_jquery_com() and assumed it was a default.
[10:52:24] <ajpiano> there's a "cascade" or something.  but based on how many are there, editing the jquery.com menu should only affect... jquery.com
[10:52:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's a cascade.
[10:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> The most complex example is api.jqueryui.com/1.8/
[10:53:14] <ajpiano> point being that changes made to the menu_header_jquery_com will affect, for instance books.jquery.com and blog.jquery.com as well
[10:53:32] <scott_gonzalez> menu_header_api_jqueryui_com_1_8() -> menu_header_api_jqueryui_com() -> menu_header_jqueryui_com()
[10:53:38] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[10:55:37] <danheberden> wowsers
[10:56:32] <danheberden> seems like an assoc array might be better organization for that? either way, thanks y'all
[11:00:28] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15kinergy opened issue #207: $.post incorrectly states that POST is never cached  02http://git.io/neavew
[11:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano danheberden: We're holding on new-css deploy until jquery.com is ready?
[11:16:48] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i don't necessarily think we should
[11:17:02] <ajpiano> if everything else is ready to go, dan can keep working in master
[11:17:17] <ajpiano> we aren't going to tag new-css to push live for awhile, we just want to change branches
[11:17:30] <ajpiano> though i guess that isn't "deploying' strictly speaking
[11:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I thought the plan was to deploy as soon as we switch.
[11:17:46] <danheberden> either way, i'll just be merging into a different branch
[11:18:07] <danheberden> if we switch to master
[11:18:09] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i assumed we'd want to give it a few days this week on stage for things to shake out
[11:18:12] <danheberden> will that affect current sites?
[11:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> So we should start back porting our ThemeRoller code to master?
[11:18:30] <ajpiano> and then maybe tag later in the week, let it shake out of over the weekend, and really talk about it all being new on the 14th
[11:18:57] <ajpiano> ohh
[11:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> The longer we can't deploy new-css, the longer we have to duplicate changes.
[11:19:17] <ajpiano> right
[11:19:29] <ajpiano> it really depends when we're talking about.
[11:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> We've only been testing UI stuff agianst new-css.
[11:19:44] <ajpiano> if we weren't waiting for jquery.com itself, when would UI be ready to go?
[11:20:09] <ajpiano> i.e., are we ready to switch new-css for master otherwise?
[11:20:19] <scott_gonzalez> Probably today, though we'd likely wait till tomorrow.
[11:20:29] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin wants us to wait till tomorrow to do our RC.
[11:20:40] <ajpiano> yeah
[11:20:43] <scott_gonzalez> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gka9MDXWIa4O00JU5JaHp2hOOvyr8iiCx7Zr__I-M1M/edit#
[11:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> All sites are green.
[11:20:59] <ajpiano>  do you want to do the branch switch today, then?
[11:21:18] <ajpiano> i don't want you to have to backport any more changes
[11:21:20] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, switch the branch so that we get it in stage?
[11:21:24] <ajpiano> right
[11:21:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let me pull out the links to the learn site from all the footers.
[11:21:48] <scott_gonzalez> Then I'll rename the branches.
[11:21:54] <scott_gonzalez> And we'll watch things explode.
[11:22:03] <ajpiano> ok!
[11:22:06] <ajpiano> and then we'll fix syntax
[11:22:22] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[11:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: ^
[11:23:48] <jzaefferer> looking
[11:24:10] <scott_gonzalez> jzaefferer: We're gonng move new-css to master in a few minutes.
[11:24:19] <jzaefferer> nice
[11:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> That will get us all the sites on stage.
[11:24:41] <jzaefferer> I'll be gone for dinner soonish, but can check stuff afterwards (maybe)
[11:24:46] <scott_gonzalez> I'll have to walk through all the content repos and find the ones that I created a new-css branch for.
[11:25:14] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, we're hoping to deploy tomorrow. That'll coincide with the RC.
[11:25:32] <scott_gonzalez> And we'll push new download builder with that as well.
[11:27:17] <jzaefferer> okay, RC together with multi-version is sane
[11:27:32] <jzaefferer> as long as we get it in front of users before the rush to the final release

[11:30:34] <danheberden> or someone rushed JUST A TAD TOO MUCH
[11:30:39] <jzaefferer> btw. thanks ajpiano and scott_gonzalez so much for all the work on new-css. Awesome that you fixed the highlighter as well, so nice to finally have that out of the way :-)
[11:30:41] <danheberden> <3z
[11:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> ?twss
[11:30:51] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: story of my life i'm afraid
[11:31:05] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: yeah excited to get the highlighting out of the way as well
[11:31:19] * scott_gonzalez wonders if GitHub will explode if I `git push origin :master`
[11:31:33] <scott_gonzalez> heh, it seems to be hanging...
[11:31:46] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it liked that.
[11:31:54] <jzaefferer> why are you deleting master?
[11:31:57] <scott_gonzalez> force push it is.
[11:32:04] <scott_gonzalez> Because new-css is becoming master.
[11:32:07] <scott_gonzalez> And it can't be a merge.
[11:32:11] <jzaefferer> oh
[11:32:12] <jzaefferer> okay
[11:32:14] <ajpiano> couldn't you do git push origin new-css:master ?
[11:32:14] <jzaefferer> fun fun fun
[11:32:14] <ajpiano> maybe
[11:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> It'll need to be a force push since it has different history.
[11:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll try though.
[11:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, rejected for not being a fast-forward.

[11:46:43] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like those were the only two sites that needed branches for the actual content.
[11:47:04] <scott_gonzalez> All three deploys finished on stage, so everything should be updated.
[11:47:11] <scott_gonzalez> Next up: ThemeRoller.
[11:48:21] <ajpiano> whoa
[11:48:22] <ajpiano> it's on stage,
[11:48:23] <ajpiano> trippy
[11:49:11] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:49:13] <ajpiano> hey
[11:49:23] <ajpiano> so what do i do as a repo-haver to do this right
[11:49:35] <ajpiano> do i just pull master?
[11:49:47] <scott_gonzalez> git fetch & git reset --hard origin/master
[11:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> If you pull, you'll get a merge conflict.
[11:50:03] <ajpiano> i figured
[11:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> So you'll need to fetch and reset.
[11:53:02] <ajpiano> boom
[11:56:18] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ajpiano Hi, just had a look at the api site with the new (now live) css... I am finding the new font a bit too square... (not girly enough ;-) ) is this still up for discussion ? (It's ok if it's not ;-) )
[11:56:27] <ajpiano> it's not :)
[11:56:40] <ajpiano> sorry
[11:56:54] <agcolom> :-( ( ;-) )
[11:57:00] <ajpiano> where do you find it too square
[11:57:04] <ajpiano> everywhere, or in particular places
[11:57:16] <scott_gonzalez> I think she means each character is too square.
[11:57:18] <ajpiano> the text-transform: uppercase in the main nav gets me a little weird
[11:57:19] <ajpiano> yeah, i know
[11:57:31] <agcolom> the headers...
[11:57:39] <ajpiano> ok, well it's only used in headers
[11:57:47] <ajpiano> i was just curious if the all uppercase was particularly worse
[11:57:51] <agcolom> yes, and in the top menu
[11:58:18] <agcolom> it feels very masculine (hope that's the correct way to say it! )
[11:59:07] <ajpiano> i don't see us changing it, we picked it out for the new logos and wanted to consolidate to use that in headers
[11:59:13] <ajpiano> instead of having proxima nova as well
[11:59:25] <ajpiano> agcolom: any better without the uppercase? http://cl.ly/image/0Q2X2s0z2m3Q
[11:59:56] <DaveMethvin> Use this font instead, not quite as masculine: http://goo.gl/4DJQf
[12:00:07] <ajpiano> lol
[12:00:09] <DaveMethvin> :D
[12:00:39] <DaveMethvin> i prefer no uppercase but the fonts kinda small
[12:01:14] <agcolom> yes, I have no strong opinion on upper vs normal...
[12:01:28] <agcolom> I did like the previous font we had...
[12:01:32] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: yeah, agree, i would pump it up a size or two
[12:01:43] <ajpiano> just wanted to see it w/o text transform
[12:02:18] <agcolom> (Can't remember the name... this one: http://cl.ly/image/0W292D0u0w0V)
[12:02:28] <ajpiano> Proxima Nova
[12:03:10] <ajpiano> agcolom: i only started the conversation about changing the fonts 2 months ago so :p https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/132
[12:03:12] <agcolom> ah, yes ;-)
[12:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> woot! Updated TR on stage: http://dev.jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[12:04:50] <ajpiano> looks a little weird?
[12:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe cache?
[12:06:38] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, nevermind
[12:06:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess the fact that I linked to my local site and not stage should've been a clue :-P
[12:07:17] <scott_gonzalez> TR is deployed, but stage.jqueyui.com isn't using it yet.
[12:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> ok, NOW it's updated.
[12:10:03] <ajpiano> ahh, there we go
[12:10:34] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/image/2b3J1B350z1a DaveMethvin scott_gonzalez agcolom ?
[12:10:40] <ajpiano> font-size: 18px and no uppercase
[12:10:56] <ajpiano> and added 2px of margin-right back in so that if you hover next to the active page, they don't touch edges
[12:12:09] <DaveMethvin> if they don't touch edges, that makes it even more masculine
[12:12:21] <DaveMethvin> i think that looks pretty good
[12:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> Look good to me.
[12:13:43] <ajpiano> feels good to commit on master again
[12:13:46] <jqcommit> 01[13web-base-template01] 15ajpiano pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/qszmBw
[12:13:46] <jqcommit> 13web-base-template/06master 14e1dcc04 15adam j. sontag: Increase font size, remove uppercasing from #main navigation LI text, add back in slight margin.
[12:14:10] <scott_gonzalez> One thing to note is that I changed the footer for api.jquery.com
[12:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> Now that the footer uses the grid, it no longer has tweaked sizes to make the content fit perfectly.
[12:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> So having 3 books means one drop to 2 rows on a 13" MBP.
[12:15:10] <scott_gonzalez> Whatever res that is.
[12:15:48] <ajpiano> it's dropping to 2 rows on my 25 in ch monitor too
[12:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I guess we're ready to look at syntax hlighting now.
[12:20:16] <ajpiano> cool
[12:20:30] <ajpiano> pull the grunt-jquery-content branch, i guess?
[12:20:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:21:29] <jqcommit> 01[13web-base-template01] 15ajpiano 04force-pushed 06new-css-highlightjs-integration from 14da6fb8f to 14a3aa6ac: 02http://git.io/EryV-g
[12:21:29] <jqcommit> 13web-base-template/06new-css-highlightjs-integration 14a3aa6ac 15adam j. sontag: New styles for syntax highlighting using highlight.js with custom line numbering based on SyntaxHighlighter's styles implemented in grunt-jquery-content
[12:21:37] <ajpiano> and that branch of web-base-template ^^
[12:23:24] <scott_gonzalez> ok, deployed qunitjs.com and it looks good.
[12:23:42] <scott_gonzalez> So, is this just a code review or is there any functionality that needs to be updated/fixed?
[12:23:47] <ajpiano> the only issue is with some of the auto-indenting on the api sites
[12:23:49] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, the auto-indentation adjustment
[12:23:52] <scott_gonzalez> right
[12:23:53] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:24:04] <scott_gonzalez> Let me deploy api.jqueryui.com
[12:24:17] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know of a specific page that shows the problem?
[12:24:20] <ajpiano> http://local.api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/
[12:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> So, one thing that stands out to me is the background color.
[12:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> We're using #eee everywhere else.
[12:26:01] <ajpiano> ah, easily fixed, i got that
[12:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> Should we be using #e2e2e2 or should we change the highlight background?
[12:26:28] <ajpiano> i got e2e2e2 from elsewhere in base.css
[12:26:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:26:40] <ajpiano> the default styling for `code` on 1503
[12:26:44] <ajpiano> i think we should change them both
[12:26:45] <scott_gonzalez> We should see if we're bouncing back and forth between them.
[12:26:47] <ajpiano> to #eee
[12:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:27:27] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: how does api.jquery.com get deployed? I pushed a few changes over the weekend, but haven't seen them updated on live.
[12:27:38] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Tag with a semver.
[12:27:40] <ajpiano> kswedberg: tag a new s.
[12:27:41] <ajpiano> lol
[12:27:55] <kswedberg> ah. ok. thx
[12:28:23] <kswedberg> should the tag match jQuery core version?
[12:28:44] <ajpiano> you're inevitably going to have more tags than there are jquery core versions
[12:28:45] <kswedberg> or be related in some way?
[12:28:50] <kswedberg> right.
[12:28:52] <ajpiano> you can do like 1.8.3-5
[12:28:56] <ajpiano> if you so desire
[12:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: It can be, but it doesn't really matter.
[12:29:02] <ajpiano> i think that probably makes the most sense
[12:29:10] <ajpiano> it depends what the other tags are already
[12:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's nice though if you want to be able to easily scan the list.
[12:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> That's the convention we've been using for jqueryui.com.
[12:29:42] <kswedberg> yeah. sounds good.
[12:29:44] <agcolom> ajpiano: sorry was on the phone! yes, looks good to me too...
[12:29:49] <jqcommit> 01[13web-base-template01] 15ajpiano pushed 1 new commit to 06new-css-highlightjs-integration: 02http://git.io/B_hVjA
[12:29:49] <jqcommit> 13web-base-template/06new-css-highlightjs-integration 148e343d9 15adam j. sontag: Syntax styling: remove any use of #e2e2e2 for #eee everywhere
[12:30:24] <ajpiano> so scott_gonzalez fyi, this line: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/blob/new-css-highlightjs-integration/tasks/build.js#L234
[12:30:31] <ajpiano> is theoretically the culprit
[12:30:52] <ajpiano> and since i'm getting 1 less tab in the regex than it counted, it would seem to make sense that it's off by one
[12:31:30] <ajpiano> but if i correct +1 to compensate for the fact that new Array( 7 ).join("a") === "aaaaaa", then most of the blocks end up off, anyhow
[12:31:40] <ajpiano> and the few that are wrong now, look right
[12:32:37] <scott_gonzalez> ok, I'll debug this.
[12:32:47] <ajpiano> thanks
[12:32:55] <kswedberg> btw, are we using at cache plugin at all in web-base-template? might help with page load speed.
[12:33:03] <kswedberg> *a cache plugin
[12:34:59] <agcolom> ajpiano: kswedberg scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin When I look at http://stage.learn.jquery.com/ the top menu looks nicer I think (without the text transform...)
[12:35:22] <ajpiano> yeah, indeed
[12:35:36] <DaveMethvin> yes, altho that looks like it's also bold and making the font a bit blocky
[12:35:53] <DaveMethvin> for example the "e" in guide
[12:35:54] <ajpiano> oh is it fake bolded
[12:36:01] <DaveMethvin> I DEMAND REAL BOLD
[12:36:09] <ajpiano> it's real bold with fake bold added i think
[12:36:14] <ajpiano> i r bad at fontz
[12:36:56] <kswedberg> agcolom: +1 on the non-text-transform
[12:37:22] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: it's looking weird for me on windows, and fine on mac
[12:37:25] <ajpiano> i don't know what the crap is going on there
[12:41:18] <agcolom> sorry one more thing... On say this page: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/
[12:41:55] <agcolom> oh wait, I'm confused... 
[12:42:09] <agcolom> ajpiano: have you removed the text transform yet?
[12:42:23] <ajpiano> yes
[12:42:36] <agcolom> Cool! Thanks, that's better I think!
[12:42:57] <agcolom> So one more thing... how about changing the hr height from 1em to .75em?
[12:43:13] <agcolom> (for example on this page http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/)
[12:43:28] <ajpiano> why?
[12:43:30] <agcolom> (the hr with the dots)
[12:43:55] <ajpiano> i want to decrease the vertical height of the pages but i think it's mostly gonna come out of padding/margin on paragraphs and headers
[12:44:02] <agcolom> just because it looks a bit too big... but then again I'll follow the majority :-)
[12:44:12] <ajpiano> i guess it does look a bit chunky, now having looked at it at .75em
[12:44:45] <ajpiano> damn, the fact that that hr has 2em of bottom and top margin is responsible for a huge a mount of our vertical waste
[12:44:45] <kswedberg> fwiw, I like .75em better, too
[12:44:49] <ajpiano> yeah
[12:44:56] <ajpiano> i said "why" before i looked at it :p
[12:45:00] <kswedberg> ajpiano: yes
[12:45:33] <kswedberg> *yes to the 2em margin being responsible for vertical waste
[12:45:36] <ajpiano> yah
[12:47:25] <agcolom> I really like the fading vertical line next to the menu
[12:47:45] <ajpiano> which one?
[12:48:24] <agcolom> on the page http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/ the one between the left menu and the text
[12:49:06] <agcolom> looks like FF does not render the fading effect...
[12:49:14] <ajpiano> i'm looking in chrome
[12:49:18] <agcolom> it looks great on Safari
[12:49:18] <ajpiano> it's just a gradient on the container?
[12:49:27] <agcolom> just checking...
[12:49:37] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Well, here's the first problem...
[12:49:42] <agcolom> yes
[12:49:53] <scott_gonzalez> You're running your test against the output of highlight.js instead of the source.
[12:50:13] <ajpiano> yeah
[12:50:30] <ajpiano> the transformation probably should be happening first
[12:50:35] <ajpiano> instead of in the add-line-numbers helper
[12:50:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'll change this around.
[12:50:40] <ajpiano> okay
[12:52:46] <ajpiano> thansk :)
[12:53:59] <ajpiano>  margin-bottom: 20px on all paragraphs seems nuts
[12:54:36] <scott_gonzalez> There was a comment on HN about every site released in the past year or so having too much whitespace, and I agree.
[12:54:42] <scott_gonzalez> I think the designs that people have been releasing is insane.
[12:55:04] <ajpiano> yeah, i'm trying to just tighten up things vertically a little right now
[12:55:25] <ajpiano> i don't think we need a condensed view option so much as we just need to eliminate some of this overly margined stuff
[12:56:36] <ajpiano> we can even up the line-height inside of paragraphs as per #158
[13:03:04] <agcolom> Finally, I'm not terribly convinced by the bullet points for the list items in the menu, but then I have nothing better to offer...
[13:03:55] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: is it just me or did people complain about the autofocus on the search field before?
[13:04:03] <ajpiano> or am i thinking of a different autofocus (on trac?)
[13:04:09] <ajpiano> cause a lot of people are now complaining that it's missing
[13:04:46] <kswedberg> ajpiano: people complained about it before
[13:05:14] <ajpiano> you can please some of the people...
[13:05:27] <ajpiano> agcolom: yeah i'm not sold on them either

[13:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: ^
[13:16:48] <scott_gonzalez> I cleaned it up a bit too.
[13:17:06] <scott_gonzalez> No more `new Array()` for the regex.
[13:18:32] <ajpiano> sweet, checking now
[13:18:37] <ajpiano> was curious to see what you'd do with it
[13:18:47] <ajpiano> i was definitely in a get-it-the-fuck-done-ish  mode with that :p
[13:18:53] <scott_gonzalez> The diff isn't very diffy since I moved everything.
[13:18:57] <ajpiano> yah
[13:19:15] <scott_gonzalez> I also switched to arr.forEach() instead of using _.each()
[13:19:29] <ajpiano> good call
[13:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> And dropped the line number helper since it ended up being reduced to a single function call :-P
[13:19:53] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I have a suggestion on http://stage.jqueryui.com/themeroller/ 
[13:20:04] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: I'm listening :-)
[13:20:35] <ajpiano> ahh, nice
[13:20:38] <agcolom> currently, there is not enough space to view the color values if the characters used are quite wide (e.g. #3636363)
[13:20:40] <ajpiano> yeah, the fewer helpers the better
[13:20:42] <ajpiano> the less to convert later
[13:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:20:53] <agcolom> sorry 363636
[13:21:21] <agcolom> it seems that increasing the width by 3 px does the trick (there are 3 different values)
[13:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, It's been like that forever.
[13:22:09] <scott_gonzalez> I blame Todd and Scott :-P
[13:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Want to send a PR?
[13:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/download.jqueryui.com/blob/master/app/resources/themeroller.css
[13:22:42] <agcolom> ok... will try...
[13:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> Rafael will test it, so if you know what the changes are from working in the dev tools, feel free to just edit right in GitHub.
[13:23:13] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: so, what shall we do next
[13:23:24] <ajpiano> just merge that to grunt-jquery-content and cut 0.7.3 or 0.8 ?
[13:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, let's get that into grunt-jquery-content master, tag 0.8.0, and update all content repos to use it.
[13:24:03] <ajpiano> fuck yeah
[13:24:06] <agcolom> Can I do a PR if I have edit rights?
[13:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Yup, just fork and edit in your fork.
[13:24:22] <ajpiano> agcolom: yeah, just push to anywhere besdies masster
[13:24:24] <scott_gonzalez> Then you'll be able to do a PR.
[13:24:34] <scott_gonzalez> Or you can clone the repo and branch.
[13:24:42] <agcolom> ok, cool, thanks!
[13:25:26] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Want me to do the grunt-jquery-content release?
[13:25:36] <ajpiano> yessiree
[13:25:50] <scott_gonzalez> ok, doing it now :-)
[13:25:56] <ajpiano> i can merge the syntax highlighting styles to w-b-t master
[13:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, let's get that done now.

[13:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see what's going on.
[13:31:10] <ajpiano> yeah
[13:31:26] <scott_gonzalez> api.jqueryui.com is deploying fine.
[13:31:28] <ajpiano> i know
[13:31:29] <scott_gonzalez> So this is odd.
[13:31:40] <ajpiano> i was deploying api.jquery.com locally though, and ran into that
[13:31:48] <ajpiano> was doing grunt -f :/
[13:32:06] <ajpiano> i will hold off on editing content repo versions until we are sure there isn't gonna be a 0.8.1
[13:32:16] <ajpiano> but it's prob in the api.jquery.com content i would thinkg
[13:33:05] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, time to start adding some debug.
[13:33:34] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery.proxy.xml
[13:37:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, interesting, it's the <entry type="method" return="Function">
[13:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> So, there will be an 0.8.1
[13:38:44] <ajpiano> there ya go
[13:38:44] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: did you do the new-css stuff for jqueryui.com?
[13:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: yup
[13:39:20] <danheberden> did you remove the background image on purpose?
[13:39:32] <scott_gonzalez> It was removed from all sites.
[13:39:37] <scott_gonzalez> That was actually ajpiano :-)
[13:39:40] <danheberden> oh gotcha
[13:39:43] <danheberden> so no bg images?
[13:39:45] <scott_gonzalez> We removed a lot of gradients and stuff.
[13:39:53] <ajpiano> yeah, no bg images at all
[13:39:56] <danheberden> what is our style plan then?
[13:39:58] <ajpiano> we might add gradients back
[13:40:08] <danheberden> this is very, you know, image/gradient-y https://photos-4.dropbox.com/t/0/AABn2wmgASIym0oo6OEVWrfGJf21m9XkQdrwKcM3z6keqg/10/980019/png/32x32/2/1357588800/0/2/jQuery-Home3.png/cJZau9GOTSbkftIRGXjH7LMbR_0LdN9i-UFoBoZAF8Y?size=1280x960
[13:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we may add that back, but it'll be in CSS.
[13:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> That 404s for me.
[13:40:44] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: go to bit.ly/jqredesign directly
[13:40:47] <ajpiano> then you'll be able to get in
[13:41:11] <ajpiano> danheberden: that, but without a background image gradient, just with a flat blue
[13:41:22] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: ajpiano http://danheberden.com/share/46295b.png
[13:41:56] <ajpiano> yep
[13:41:56] <danheberden> i'm fine doing something without gradients
[13:42:05] <danheberden> but that design wont' be it
[13:42:21] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: You shouldn't need to implement any styles for the main layout.
[13:42:27] <ajpiano> i mean, what you are designing/laying out is "inside the box"
[13:42:27] <ajpiano> ^^
[13:42:27] <scott_gonzalez> It should all be there already.
[13:42:29] <scott_gonzalez> Just without the gradients.
[13:42:47] <danheberden> ok i'm getting mixed messages here
[13:42:51] <danheberden> i was told to do jquery.com
[13:42:53] <danheberden> but it's already done?
[13:42:57] <danheberden> so what am i doing?
[13:43:11] <danheberden> keep in mind i haven't been doing this witih you, so i don't have all the context you do
[13:43:13] <ajpiano> you don't have to do the outer shell, it's the same as already implemented
[13:43:23] <danheberden> what is "the outer shell"
[13:43:31] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Just delete page.php from web-base-template/themes/jquery.com/
[13:43:35] <ajpiano> danheberden: delete the e^^^
[13:43:36] <ajpiano> lol
[13:43:45] <danheberden> this is what i have http://danheberden.com/share/f995fcc.png
[13:43:55] <ajpiano> right
[13:44:05] <danheberden> that doesn't look anything close to the mock
[13:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully in the ends we can just delete the jquery.com directory completey, since jquery should have all the correct templates/images.
[13:44:12] <danheberden> is it ok that i make it look like that?
[13:44:22] <ajpiano> so you're doing everything inside of the #content-wrapper
[13:44:26] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: that doesn't seem very... cascading
[13:44:26] <ajpiano> danheberden: right
[13:44:38] <danheberden> like, it seems against the entire idea of the themes folder
[13:44:43] <danheberden> of root styles that get extended
[13:45:04] <ajpiano>  agree w/ danheberden, we should keep any stuff that's specific to the jquery.com layout in its own theme, but it won't be a lot
[13:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> So, jquery.com will continue to exist because of the index page and the sidebar, at least.
[13:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> I just looked at the comps again.
[13:45:27] <ajpiano> yah
[13:45:34] <ajpiano> and wil prob have some custom css in the end
[13:45:50] <danheberden> it certainly should, if it's going to look anything like the mock
[13:45:55] <danheberden> those download boxes don't make themselves
[13:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: You'll want to add this in the metadata for the index page: "pageTemplate": "page-contentfull.php"
[13:46:13] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: thnx for the tip
[13:46:15] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: All of that content needs to live in jquery.com repo, not web-base-template.
[13:46:24] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: obvs
[13:46:36] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: content != that mock
[13:46:38] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you just mean the CSS for the style box.
[13:46:42] <danheberden> there you o
[13:46:42] <scott_gonzalez> s/style/download/
[13:46:43] <danheberden> go
[13:46:50] <danheberden> and the demo thing
[13:46:57] <danheberden> and the css3 compliant logo or whatever
[13:46:58] <danheberden> all that shit
[13:47:01] <ajpiano> yeah
[13:47:03] <ajpiano> defintely
[13:47:17] <scott_gonzalez> You can also add a sidebar.php that hard-codes the sidebar (if we even know what's going in the sidebar).
[13:47:28] <scott_gonzalez> Just check another site that has a sidebar to see the markup.
[13:47:29] <danheberden> there's one on the right
[13:47:35] <danheberden> down below
[13:47:46] <danheberden> but that might be lame
[13:47:56] <danheberden> i might take some creative liberty on that
[13:47:59] <ajpiano> danheberden: i don't think you should feel all that constrained by this comp at all
[13:48:06] <danheberden> noted
[13:48:08] <scott_gonzalez> agreed
[13:48:24] <danheberden> and no bg images and no gradients
[13:48:26] <danheberden> yes?
[13:48:26] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling that we'll start diverging from the comps now that we're ready to deploy.
[13:48:36] <scott_gonzalez> Since we'll start getting actuall feedback.
[13:48:58] <ajpiano> yea
[13:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Well, I've tracked down the commit that broke api.jquery.com: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/commit/2f3f8c4
[13:51:34] <ajpiano> ah
[13:51:48] <ajpiano> that would explain why kswedberg might have had some trouble deploying :p
[14:01:15] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like I've got this fixed.
[14:01:23] <ajpiano> great
[14:01:24] <scott_gonzalez> Just waiting for the deploy to finish to make sure I didn't break anything.
[14:04:37] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: PR done ;-)
[14:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks
[14:06:30] <agcolom> bedtime in London... Goodnight :-)
[14:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Should we change the font for the types? http://cl.ly/image/331G3a0u2R0Q
[14:07:41] <scott_gonzalez> It's embedded inside the header.
[14:07:52] <ajpiano> what page is that on?
[14:08:03] <scott_gonzalez> http://dev.api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[14:08:17] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/
[14:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[14:08:36] <scott_gonzalez> Third time's a charm :-)
[14:08:42] <ajpiano> yeah i realised from the word source :p
[14:09:11] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it looks right to me (functionality), so I'm going to tag 0.8.1.
[14:09:40] <ajpiano> yeah, sounds good, just on the phone with DaveMethvin for a quick second
[14:10:47] <ajpiano> hrm yeah i hadn't encountered that case
[14:11:05] <ajpiano> i'm about to commit some vertical spacing tweaks
[14:11:08] <ajpiano> then i'll do content repos
[14:11:15] <ajpiano> then i'll look at that font thing
[14:11:53] <ajpiano> we also should do a final audit of the contents of the TOP top menu

[14:25:32] <ajpiano> what styles?
[14:25:42] <scott_gonzalez> The h2 in the download box.
[14:25:56] <scott_gonzalez> I guess you bumped up the size a bit?
[14:26:20] <ajpiano> d'oh
[14:27:08] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I don't see what you changed.
[14:27:25] <ajpiano> yeah i left the font-sizes on #content h1 h2 h3
[14:27:36] <ajpiano> just took out the unnecesesary respecific of font stack and unique margin

[15:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> I assume you'll just want to split the individual styles out, but wasn't sure if you'd just want to drop the line-height setting and maybe use a general rule of 1em.

[18:29:28] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: using page-contentfull.php for pageTemplate resulted in `page template is not valid error`
[18:29:45] <danheberden> i noticed learn.jquery.com uses `home.php`
[18:29:53] <danheberden> though i'm really confused why this is in the content and not the theme :/
[19:12:40] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: The theme defines what that template is. The content needs to define which template it uses (if it differs from the default).
[19:44:27] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: any idea why the error?
[20:15:26] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Not sure. Does it fail if you try again?
[20:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> rworth filed this the other day: https://github.com/scottgonzalez/grunt-wordpress/issues/10
[20:17:06] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: well don't i feel foolish
[20:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> So it worked on the second try?
[20:17:29] <danheberden> yeah - only because *this* time there were files already present
[20:17:40] <danheberden> like - before i never got that error
[20:17:47] <danheberden> but when i redeployed the content
[20:17:56] <danheberden> so i'm good now :)
[20:17:58] <danheberden> thanks youss
[20:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I'll have to figure out what's causing that.
[20:18:10] <scott_gonzalez> Might be a bug in WordPress.
