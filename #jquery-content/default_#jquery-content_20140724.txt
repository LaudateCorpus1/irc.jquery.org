[08:52:48] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: Are you actually around?
[08:53:37] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming he's not, kswedberg, can you read from https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/472#issuecomment-49909205 to the end?
[08:54:01] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: sure
[08:54:02] <scott_gonzalez> I just want someone else to confirm that https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/pull/57 should land.
[08:55:29] <kswedberg> ok, so doing this... <argument name="extraParameter" type="Anything" optional="true" rest="true" /> would render ...
[08:55:32] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/538 + https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/pull/57 does result in the same output as what's in his second screenshot.
[08:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> It results in:
[08:56:15] <scott_gonzalez> Type: Function( Event eventObject [, Anything extra ] [, ... ] )
[08:56:57] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: ah. great! yeah, that looks good. I like it.
[08:57:01] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:58:23] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
