[14:11:30] <leobalter> :) next year I'll ask for view access to web-events' repo, so I can do better reviews :)
[14:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> leobalter: If web-events exists in a year, I'll going to kill myself.
[14:23:52] <scott_gonzalez> It needs to become events.jquery.org and be public way before then.
[14:24:54] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of which, I'm running out of available weekends this summer. ajpiano: We should talk this week and try to find a good time to work on this.
[14:25:32] <ajpiano> ha, yeah, seriously

[14:26:12] <scott_gonzalez> Weekday works too.
[14:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps a Thursday/Friday when I have no meetings.
[14:27:31] <ajpiano> i could do  pretty much any thurs/fri in august
[14:29:01] <scott_gonzalez> How's the 21st/22nd?
