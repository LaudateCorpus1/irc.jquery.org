[10:43:00] <rworth> do you know how to do that, or only scott_gonzalez ?
[10:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> I can do it in a minute.
[10:44:58] <rworth> thanks scott_gonzalez 
[10:54:32] <scott_gonzalez> damn, the styling on the books in the footer seems overly complex
[10:55:42] <scott_gonzalez> Call me insensitive, but I removed some gradients from the .2% of our visitors who use Opera <12.1 :-P

[11:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Please make sure you're using tabs for indentation when working on sites.
[11:27:38] <ajpiano> i think we have a lot of inconsistency in some of the page dirs across repos
[11:27:52] <ajpiano> but at least within a paritcular file,, you should be consistent :p
[11:33:37] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: yes, sorry, i wasn't as consistent in the thick of rushing to get done - my apologies for being lazy
[11:33:52] <danheberden> funny how i switched to just pressing space twice
[11:34:05] <danheberden> i didn't ever mean to do that - i just meant to switch to 2 space tabs, lol
[11:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I figured you always press tab and just had vim set to 2 spaces.
[11:35:26] <scott_gonzalez> Do you have the editorconfig plugin for vim?
[11:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> We could just add editorconfig settings to all of our projects.
[11:54:35] <ajpiano> that would be rad
[12:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is there a way to disable the URL autocompletion on 404?
[12:07:26] <nacin> add_filter( 'redirect_canonical', function ( $redirect_url ) { if ( is_404() ) return false;¬†return $redirect_url; } );
[12:08:22] <scott_gonzalez> Cool, that will still allow /foo to redirect to /foo/ ?
[12:08:29] <nacin> yes
[12:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[12:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> I may have one more question, but I'll first see what happens after I add this.
[12:10:54] <scott_gonzalez> Is there a way to have /{existing-page}/{non-existing-child}/ redirect to the parent page?
[12:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> Or would that just need to be custom logic inside the filter?
[12:11:17] <nacin> would require some custom logic
[12:11:26] <nacin> a decent amount of particular logic, if I had to guess
[12:11:31] <nacin> if it's something you need, I can take a look
[12:14:27] <scott_gonzalez> No, it's fine. People would have to be manually typing bad URLs.
[12:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> The big concern is stopping plugins.jquery.com/foo/1.2.3/ from redirecting to /bar/1.2.3/ if there is no 1.2.3 for foo.
[12:15:57] <scott_gonzalez> Which the simple filter solves.
