[17:38:58] <JamesMGreene> ajpiano et al: I understand. However, I personally find it hard to figure out what kind of presentation pitch to make if I don't have a good idea on the duration. Others may be in the same boat, which could prevent some great potential speakers from applying... something to consider.
[17:48:47] <ajpiano> JamesMGreene: they'll probabably be ~40ish
[17:49:08] <ajpiano> i can't see them being more than that, and 30 was a bit too short it seemed in austin
[20:54:21] <JamesMGreene> ajpiano: Cool, I'll keep ~40 in mind and see what I can come up with
