[00:58:07] <ajpiano> danheberden: hey
[00:58:18] <ajpiano> you should make your <leader>t2 shortcut be "expandtab" at the end
[00:58:26] <ajpiano> cause that's how you make it convert tabs into spaces
[00:58:31] <ajpiano> assuming that's what you want
[00:58:50] <danheberden> hmmm
[01:01:03] <danheberden> i wonder if you can determine if there is content or not on the current line
[01:01:34] <ajpiano> well at least for me... cause i want 2 space soft tabs for pretty much everything except jQuery stuff

[04:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Be aware that grunt-jq-content is tagged frequently. So if you're working in master, you may break jquery.com in production.
[05:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh man, it's going to be a long day.
[05:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> That was supposed to be jquery-wp-content, not grunt-jq-content.
[05:07:33] <scott_gonzalez> I'm writing everything backward today :-/
[05:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden ajpiano: jquery-wp-content is guaranteed to be tagged before jquery.com is going live.

[05:39:52] <scott_gonzalez> I also created a jquery-com branch that doesn't have the revert.
[05:39:59] <scott_gonzalez> But we can't work on jquery.com in master right now.

[08:44:20] <ajpiano> ah scott_gonzalez, sorry, i figured that with only two days left to go we were ok to go into master
[08:44:26] <ajpiano> but who knows what we'd have to tag in the interim
[08:44:30] <ajpiano> so thanks for rolling it all back
[08:44:37] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[08:44:42] <scott_gonzalez> I was gonna let it go as long as I could.
[08:44:46] <scott_gonzalez> It ended up being less than an hour :-P
[08:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> Needed to do the 1.9.0 update.
[08:45:35] <ajpiano> haha
[08:46:55] <scott_gonzalez> I knew we'd need to revert the wp-content changes to launch the plugins site.
[08:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> I thought the jquery.com repo would be fine.
[08:47:20] <scott_gonzalez> But then DaveMethvin|away asked me to do the 1.9.0 download/CDN changes.
[08:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> I did have my first merge reverting experience.
[08:47:54] <scott_gonzalez> So that was a learning experience :-P
[08:49:11] <ajpiano> heh
[08:49:16] <scott_gonzalez> Keeping jquery-wp-content deployable is definitely tricky with this many sites.
[08:49:32] <ajpiano> especially if you also want to preview them on stage :p
[08:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to point out that we were going to constantly run into this problem, but people seemed to think it wouldn't really be an issue :-P
[08:50:16] <scott_gonzalez> I have an item on my todo list to talk to gnarf about being able to stage other branches.
[08:50:32] <ajpiano> yah, i think we need to be able to stage other branches potentially, but we've managed to get pretty far
[08:50:40] <scott_gonzalez> We run into some serious issues with UI because of download builder being its own repo.
[08:50:41] <ajpiano> w/o it
[08:50:48] <ajpiano> i can't even build jqueryui.com locally :(
[08:51:05] <scott_gonzalez> Why not? What error are you getting?
[08:51:30] <ajpiano> same thing as the other week, it just spins its wheels and blows up
[08:51:34] <ajpiano> i'll deploy right now and see what happens
[08:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:02:23] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: http://cl.ly/image/412F1E3L1i0A
[09:02:42] <ajpiano> it spins there for a while, and then blows up
[09:03:10] <scott_gonzalez> syslog, huh?
[09:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> node -v
[09:05:24] <ajpiano> 0.8.15
[09:05:27] <scott_gonzalez> FYI: api.jquerymobile.com just went live.
[09:05:41] <scott_gonzalez> They were linking to stage in their blog post, so I figured we needed to get the live site out
[09:05:54] <ajpiano> dayme
[09:06:05] <ajpiano> that's gonna make me want to change the bg colour
[09:06:11] <ajpiano> on the legacy blog and .com :/
[09:06:19] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[09:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> Well, we've got api.jquery.com live with a totally different blog and .com for a while.
[09:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> Doesn't seem much different.
[09:06:54] <ajpiano> yeah but it was at least.... orange
[09:07:18] <scott_gonzalez> I mean core.
[09:07:35] <ajpiano> it'll end up only being less than 2 weeks
[09:07:50] <ajpiano> i'll live :p
[09:08:01] <ajpiano> i just want all the legacy sites to go boom
[09:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:08:06] <scott_gonzalez> indeed
[09:08:12] <ajpiano> but we still have crap like forum and bugs to deal with
[09:08:13] <scott_gonzalez> npm -v ?
[09:08:14] <ajpiano> uch
[09:08:23] <ajpiano> 0.8.15 ^^
[09:08:28] <ajpiano> gonna upgrade to 0.8.17
[09:08:29] <scott_gonzalez> npm, not node :-)
[09:08:36] <ajpiano> 1.1.66
[09:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...so this definitely isn't the old bug of npm bulding the wrong versions.
[09:09:33] <scott_gonzalez> What happens if you go into a new directory and `npm install syslog` ?
[09:10:29] <ajpiano> v 1.1 installs successsfully, it seems
[09:11:32] <scott_gonzalez> If you run the node repl and require( "syslog" ) does it error?
[09:13:16] <ajpiano> nope
[09:13:54] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...wonder why it fails for download builder then.
[09:14:15] <ajpiano> i'll see if it still happens on 0.8.17
[09:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, ajpiano wrong module.
[09:17:12] <scott_gonzalez> try npm install node-syslog
[09:17:53] <scott_gonzalez> And actually, try node-syslog@1.1.6 since he just released 1.1.7.
[09:17:58] <ajpiano> ah, well now i'm on 0.8.17 :
[09:18:06] <ajpiano> let me try building jqueryui.com first
[09:19:24] <ajpiano> nope, same
[09:19:56] <ajpiano> ah
[09:19:57] <ajpiano> duped it
[09:20:22] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/image/2F1V2f422o36
[09:21:15] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[09:21:23] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try a fresh install of node-syslog.
[09:21:36] <ajpiano> same thing happens on 1.1.7
[09:22:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, this is the old version problem.
[09:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> Note that node-gyp rebuild produced Debug output, not Release output.
[09:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ping isaacs in #node.js
[09:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> $ npm -v
[09:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> 1.1.65
[09:23:06] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if it's a bug that was reintroduced in 1.1.66.
[09:23:19] <ajpiano> i'm on npm 1.2.0 now
[09:23:23] <ajpiano> :/
[09:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> I'm installing 0.8.17 now, so I'll have a matching system.
[09:24:24] <ajpiano> cool
[09:24:35] <scott_gonzalez> On a related note, 0.10 is coming soon :-)
[09:24:38] <ajpiano> :D
[09:24:44] <ajpiano> brb !
[09:26:51] <scott_gonzalez> worked fine for me
[09:32:23] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: The answer I got was that you have a debug build of node.
[09:32:34] <scott_gonzalez> But I assume you used nave to install.
[09:33:05] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yep, nave indeed
[09:33:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not even sure how to tell if node is a debug build.
[09:53:12] <ajpiano> apparently with process.features.debug
[09:53:16] <ajpiano> which is, naturally, false :)
[09:56:16] <scott_gonzalez> heh

[09:59:15] <ajpiano> i'm gonna tag api.jquery.com

[10:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> no 1.9.0 love?
[10:02:17] <ajpiano> i figured they wanted to reserve that for actual 1.9 docs stuff
[10:02:45] <ajpiano> oh god now this right here is bad news
[10:03:00] <ajpiano> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[10:03:20] <ajpiano> the live docs have examples...that use live
[10:03:22] <ajpiano> fuuuuuuuuuuuuuu
[10:03:39] <ajpiano> oh but it's cause they're explicitly pulling in jquery-latest
[10:03:42] <ajpiano> guh
[10:04:19] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez:   <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script> where is that coming from
[10:04:28] <ajpiano> in the examples
[10:06:10] <ajpiano> this is an actual proble m/
[10:10:31] <ajpiano> gah, what creates the demos
[10:10:31] <ajpiano> :/
[10:17:29] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: It's from api.jquery.com/entries2html.xsl
[10:17:51] <ajpiano> soooo
[10:17:55] <ajpiano> we are in a bit of a pickle
[10:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> This is why we need versioned docs.
[10:18:06] <ajpiano> we can't refer to latest there anymore
[10:18:11] <ajpiano>  yea
[10:18:51] <ajpiano> well, right now any method removed in 1.9 is having js errors on the corresponding docs page in production, likely
[10:21:01] <ajpiano> e.g. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/ as well
[10:21:12] <ajpiano> what should we do :/
[10:22:21] <scott_gonzalez> DELETE!
[10:22:30] <scott_gonzalez> We should version the docs.
[10:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> We can get that done today.
[10:23:06] <ajpiano> if you say so :p
[10:28:39] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano is good at deleting things :p
[10:29:01] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: did you reach gnarf
[10:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, on the phone with him right now.
[10:31:16] <ajpiano> ah ok
[10:31:32] <ajpiano> i really want to see if we can do irc.* as part of the other sites launch
[10:31:33] <scott_gonzalez> He said he'll be on IRC this afternoon.
[10:31:41] <ajpiano> ok, i'll catch up with thim then
[10:36:57] <scott_gonzalez> He just went out for lunch; he'll be here in about an hour.
[10:37:11] <scott_gonzalez> You didn't get a real answer about the debug build, did you?
[10:37:22] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: ping
[10:37:54] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: nope
[10:38:00] <ajpiano> but there's so much other stuff to deal with that i'm not gonna sweat it right now
[10:38:11] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: X-RateLimit-Limit:60
[10:42:49] <scott_gonzalez> THAT SHIT IS LOW
[10:44:18] <ajpiano> https://twitter.com/DamianEdwards/status/291254402461876225
[10:44:22] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: DaveMethvin kswedberg ^^
[10:44:50] <scott_gonzalez> It exists.
[10:45:04] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jquery.com/resources/api.xml
[10:45:13] <ajpiano> ahhhhhh
[10:54:35] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: is there a way to have a public staging copy of a branch?
[10:54:54] <danheberden> i was working in a branch before, which seemed fine for local dev and then merge it in
[10:54:56] <scott_gonzalez> Not today, but it's something I want.
[10:55:13] <danheberden> the work on master was just to get it on local.jquery.com
[10:55:25] <scott_gonzalez> You only need it in master for it to show up on stage.
[10:55:32] <scott_gonzalez> local can be any branch.
[10:55:55] <danheberden> yeah, that's why the work on master was just to get it on local.jquery.com
[10:56:08] <ajpiano> danheberden: do you mean stage
[10:56:12] <danheberden> ugh
[10:56:13] <danheberden> FML
[10:56:15] <ajpiano> lol
[10:56:20] <danheberden> I JUST WOKE UP
[10:56:21] <danheberden> haha
[10:56:22] <danheberden> yes i do
[10:56:56] <ajpiano> yeah, if you scroll back to 2 hours and 10 minutes ago
[10:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> It'd normally be fine for the content to be in master for a few days before it's ready to launch.
[10:56:57] <danheberden> an aside, having a developmentally challenged person working on this might not be the best idea, 
[10:56:58] <danheberden> lol
[10:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> But we have so many deploys going on right now.
[10:57:12] <ajpiano> ^^
[10:57:14] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: but tagging is what makes it live, ya?
[10:57:18] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[10:57:26] <danheberden> so jquery.com should be ok?
[10:57:28] <scott_gonzalez> And I needed to tag jquery.com this morning.
[10:57:33] <scott_gonzalez> For the 1.9.0 release.
[10:57:34] <ajpiano> we have other tags to do in the interim
[10:57:40] <danheberden> ohhh
[10:57:41] <danheberden> oh
[10:57:43] <ajpiano> yea
[10:57:53] <scott_gonzalez> And we'll need to tag jquery-wp-content at least once before jquery.com goes live for the plugins site.
[10:57:53] <ajpiano> danheberden: i had the same convo wiith scott_gonzalez upon waking up :)
[10:57:54] <danheberden> that...
[10:57:58] <danheberden> was probably not fun
[10:58:08] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, it was my first time reverting a merge.
[10:58:14] <scott_gonzalez> I got to read an email from Linus :-P
[10:58:29] <kswedberg> hey scott_gonzalez, ajpiano : just got back from lunch
[10:58:49] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: I tried to cause as little disruption as possible.
[10:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> I created a branch of the code before the reverts.
[10:59:06] <scott_gonzalez> I force pushed jquery.com because it seemed the easiest.
[10:59:16] <scott_gonzalez> But I didn't want to force push jquery-wp-content since a lot of people have that.
[10:59:21] <scott_gonzalez> So I reverted everything and then squashed.
[10:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> But there's a jquery-com branch with all the original commits.
[10:59:40] <scott_gonzalez> And jquery.com has a new-content branch with all the commits.
[11:00:13] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: api.jquery.com is busted because we document things that no longer exist, like .live().
[11:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> My suggestion is to start versioning the docs like UI does.
[11:00:50] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: ok sounds good
[11:00:55] <scott_gonzalez> The first step would be pretty simple to just get the site working properly.
[11:01:00] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: we can do that. We can also just de-demo the examples.
[11:01:25] <scott_gonzalez> Create a 1-8 branch from before any 1.9.0 docs were added.
[11:01:33] <scott_gonzalez> Add a new site in jquery-wp-content.
[11:01:46] <scott_gonzalez> Update some infra scripts.
[11:01:56] <kswedberg> so for any removed methods, just show the examples without demos
[11:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> Change the example template to pull in 1.8.3 instead of -latest.
[11:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> We can just rip out the demos too.
[11:02:19] <scott_gonzalez> And setup versioned docs later.
[11:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> If you even want them.
[11:02:29] <kswedberg> yep. I think that's easier.
[11:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> ok, less work for me today, so I'm good with that :-)
[11:02:53] <kswedberg> I can do that now if you want.
[11:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[11:03:51] <scott_gonzalez> We're gonna hit 1M downloads on new download builder next week :-)
[11:04:46] <ajpiano> should we add pages/api.(md|html) to api.jquery.com
[11:04:54] <ajpiano> to explain where the full raw xml is?
[11:05:01] <ajpiano> i'll file an issue, it isn't pressing
[11:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[11:05:35] <ajpiano> oh nice
[11:05:38] <ajpiano> you  just closed the plugins issues
[11:05:58] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, yup, I closed 'em.
[11:06:08] <scott_gonzalez> Didn't implement anything though :-P
[11:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> There is slightly less work to do though, after my call with gnarf.
[11:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> We're taking a slightly different approach to the graceful restarts.
[11:07:01] <scott_gonzalez> So it's a good thing I made sure to double check with him before I implemented what we discussed months ago.
[11:07:21] <ajpiano> yea, seriously

[11:15:23] <kswedberg> I thought it was still deprecated, not removed. 
[11:15:39] <ajpiano> no
[11:15:51] <ajpiano> that was for 1.7 and 1.8
[11:15:57] <ajpiano> 1.9 is when everything got removed
[11:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, this could explain the angry ticket this morning.
[11:16:06] <ajpiano> it seems the live deprecation is not adequately covered though
[11:16:12] <kswedberg> It is not mentioned in any of the the blog entries either
[11:16:24] <ajpiano> yeah it's really odd
[11:16:28] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13220 (this isn't it, but related)
[11:16:33] <ajpiano> it seemed like we shouted from the rooftops about live going
[11:16:37] <ajpiano> yet it's not in any of the official release stuff
[11:16:43] <danheberden> ruh roh
[11:16:48] <ajpiano> yeah, there were a few, scott_gonzalez
[11:16:48] <kswedberg> which rooftops?
[11:16:48] <scott_gonzalez> Here it is: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13213#comment:2
[11:18:04] <ajpiano> we should update the upgrade guide
[11:18:14] <kswedberg> anything else removed besides .live and $.browser? I want to make sure I get everything marked as such in the docs before pushing
[11:18:29] <danheberden> we removed $
[11:18:38] <kswedberg> thanks danheberden :p
[11:18:45] <kswedberg> ah. .selector
[11:19:03] <danheberden> and you got, like, .sub 'n all that ya
[11:19:11] <agcolom> ajpiano: this may seem crazy, but I do not seem to have your email address!
[11:19:24] <danheberden> hotginger@gma...
[11:19:25] <ajpiano> kswedberg: we can push as often as we like, so if we catch more, we can push then
[11:19:26] <kswedberg> I do now.
[11:19:35] <kswedberg> ok.
[11:19:40] <agcolom> danheberden: Happy New year! 
[11:20:39] <agcolom> What a busy week! but sometimes it's good to be busy!
[11:21:03] <danheberden> agcolom: thanks! you too! :)
[11:21:14] <agcolom> thank you :-)
[11:23:49] <danheberden> who's adding the .live content to the upgrade-guide?
[11:23:55] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquery.com01] 15kswedberg pushed 2 new commits to 06master: 02http://git.io/AoYgbg
[11:23:55] <jqcommit> 13api.jquery.com/06master 142e909b6 15Karl Swedberg: Add a few new (as of 1.9 selectors)
[11:23:55] <jqcommit> 13api.jquery.com/06master 146d8fc06 15Karl Swedberg: Mark 1.9 removed methods as removed.
[11:24:34] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: so what's the easiest way for me to pull in these changes you did on jquery.com
[11:24:39] <danheberden> just fetch an manually checkout?
[11:25:11] <danheberden> ugh but then i'm not in master
[11:25:27] <danheberden> guess i could just reset
[11:26:35] <ajpiano> yeah, just work in the branch for a bit
[11:26:46] <ajpiano> danheberden: you shoulda seen what it was like during the new-css integration
[11:26:55] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez and i didn't see master for ages
[11:27:02] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Just checkout new-content and then cherry-pick the HEAD commit of master.
[11:27:35] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, you probably can't cherry-pick that.
[11:27:42] <danheberden> i was just trying to get my master up to date
[11:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> All I did was change 1.8.3 -> 1.9.0 everywhere.
[11:27:50] <scott_gonzalez> And add the release notes line on /download.
[11:27:56] <danheberden> since pulling tries to merge the reverted code
[11:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, for master, just `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/master`
[11:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> Or whatever upstream you use.
[11:28:27] <danheberden> ok - oh, you just didn't want force on jquery-wp-content
[11:28:31] <danheberden> ok gotcha gotcha
[11:28:34] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: I tagged the api.jquery.com repo ~5 minutes ago, but it doesn't look like it deployed. 
[11:28:34] <scott_gonzalez> If you're already in a failed merge, just do a hard reset.
[11:28:38] <danheberden> i was like how the hell am i gonna do this without reset
[11:28:59] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I figured a force push on jquery.com was ok since it has very few people actually using it.
[11:29:08] <scott_gonzalez> And it produces a cleaner history.
[11:29:18] <ajpiano> kswedberg: did you push the tags?
[11:29:22] <ajpiano> it would have come in here if you did :p
[11:29:30] <danheberden> so should i be making new-content to be ready for 2.0/1.9?
[11:29:40] <ajpiano> danheberden: yep
[11:29:43] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez++
[11:29:47] <danheberden> ajpiano: cool
[11:30:17] <kswedberg> ajpiano: not sure what you mean. the tag shows up here: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/tags
[11:30:27] <ajpiano> ah
[11:30:34] <ajpiano> jqcommit just didn't say anything about it
[11:30:47] <kswedberg> no. so maybe I did it wrong?
[11:30:57] <ajpiano> ohhh
[11:31:02] <ajpiano> 1.9-1 isn't a semver
[11:31:06] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Yeah, just keep working in new-content for the 1.9/2.0 stuff.
[11:31:08] <ajpiano> 1.9.0-1 is :)
[11:31:12] <kswedberg> oh! crap
[11:31:27] <kswedberg> should I delete that tag and do over?
[11:31:36] <ajpiano> aye

[11:33:27] <kswedberg> thx, ajpiano 
[11:34:49] <kswedberg> also‚Ä¶ someone needs to change the jquery-wp-content footer to point to jQuery 1.9 instead of 1.8.3
[11:41:35] <ajpiano> i can do that
[11:41:44] <ajpiano> kswedberg: do you think you can add the part about live deprecation to the upgrade guide
[11:42:17] <kswedberg> ajpiano: where is the upgrade guide? in jquery.com?
[11:42:23] <ajpiano> yea
[11:42:52] <ajpiano> kswedberg: https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/blob/master/pages/upgrade-guide/1.9.md
[11:43:07] <kswedberg> thx
[11:48:15] <kswedberg> huh. $.browser isn't mentioned in the upgrade guide either

[12:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> Let me tell you how fun it is to test scripts that spawn scripts and respond to signals.

[12:44:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: here now
[12:45:41] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: should i do a tag for the 1.9.0 in the footer or hold off till we have the versioned doc stuff ready?
[12:46:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: the internet is being painful to me however
[12:49:44] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Sounds like the versioned docs might not come for a while.
[12:49:55] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg is just gonna remove the demos.
[12:50:01] <ajpiano> oh right, that's what i meant
[12:50:09] <ajpiano> which won't require a web base template tag at all
[12:50:16] <ajpiano> so i'll just tag now
[12:50:20] <ajpiano> well, it might :p
[12:50:26] <scott_gonzalez> DEPLOY EVERY HOUR!
[12:50:40] <kswedberg> I already removed the demos
[12:51:03] <ajpiano> oh swseet
[12:51:06] <kswedberg> oops. missed one for .die()
[12:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I implemented the SIGHUP logic.
[12:52:03] <scott_gonzalez> I just want to make sure that it'll work with puppet.
[12:52:10] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: so am i OK to do a 2.0.5 ?
[12:52:17] <scott_gonzalez> How does puppet know which process to send signals to?
[12:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Yeah.
[12:52:57] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery-wp-content01] 15ajpiano tagged 062.0.5 at 06master: 02http://git.io/78hgDw
[12:53:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so, i was just thinking about that
[12:53:38] <ajpiano> should upgrade to 1.9 in the header at some point too :p
[12:53:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: we use start_stop_daemon
[12:53:55] <gnarf> which tracks a PID file
[12:54:13] <gnarf> which means the manager shouldn't spawn, but stay the same PID on the HUP
[12:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[12:54:46] <scott_gonzalez> Respawning the manager was the hardest part.
[12:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> So we'll just assume that the manager script won't change?
[12:55:37] <scott_gonzalez> We could have 2 levels of managers :-P
[12:55:40] <gnarf> or if it does, we do a "restart" by hand
[12:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> A script that does nothing but spawn the manager.
[12:55:53] <gnarf> sure
[12:55:56] <scott_gonzalez> Heh
[12:56:01] <gnarf> so long as it keeps a PID forever
[12:56:03] <gnarf> its good
[12:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> Then we'd never have to worry about the main script ever changing.
[12:56:20] <scott_gonzalez> But that seems like overkill.
[12:56:26] <scott_gonzalez> The manager is pretty simple and likely won't change.
[12:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> Also, https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/pull/56#issuecomment-12285049
[12:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> Should we be handling SIGTERM here?
[12:57:14] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: what did we settle on: <deprecated>1.x</deprecated> or <entry deprecated="1.x"> ?
[12:57:38] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: The SIGTERM signal is sent to a process to request its termination. Unlike the SIGKILL signal, it can be caught and interpreted or ignored by the process. This allows the process to perform nice termination releasing resources and saving state if appropriate.
[12:57:48] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: It supports both, but we should move toward @deprecated.
[12:57:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: its a lazy "kill" - so yeah
[12:58:04] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: ok, thanks.
[12:58:22] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Ok, so I'll do what I said in my last comment. Make SIGNIT + SIGTERM graceful shutdown.
[12:58:25] <ryanneufeld> kill is just the tool used to send those signals
[12:58:26] <scott_gonzalez> SIGHUP = graceful restart
[12:58:32] <kswedberg> I thought it was the other way around. but I'll change things back to @deprecated
[12:58:46] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Well, we can do either.
[12:58:59] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/N15J-Q
[12:58:59] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14824877e 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: changed example colors to use new site colors
[12:58:59] <kswedberg> I know, but I'd like to standardize.
[12:59:12] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, I'm saying we can standardize to either one.
[12:59:28] <scott_gonzalez> I just thought attributes seemed better for this, since it's simple data.
[13:00:40] <kswedberg> yep. and there's an edge case where it doesn't seem to work with nodes
[13:00:49] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: To recap: I'm going to remove the restart of the manager itself and handle SIGTERM the same as SIGINT. Correct?
[13:01:02] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I've been looking for where to edit the footer of api.jquerymobile.com, but I can't find it :-(
[13:01:03] <gnarf> yes
[13:01:30] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: hmm...it *should* always work, I have <xsl:variable name="deprecated" select="@deprecated | deprecated/text()"/>
[13:01:39] <ajpiano> agcolom: themes/jquery/footer-mobile.php
[13:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: jquery/footer-mobile.php
[13:02:07] <agcolom> Thank you! I was looking in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/themes/api.jquerymobile.com/footer.php !
[13:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> Hooray for inheritance!
[13:03:12] <scott_gonzalez> We do that because we want all of the mobile sites to use the same footer.
[13:03:21] <scott_gonzalez> Without duplicating the actual content for each site.
[13:03:23] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez always typing things faster than me
[13:04:00] <ajpiano> kswedberg: also obligatory noodge on the docs page for contribute... ;)
[13:05:18] <kswedberg> ajpiano: thx. sigh. I suck at writing. (I know‚Ä¶the irony)

[13:09:12] <ajpiano> kswedberg: you think you might have something by late tomorrow?
[13:09:20] <ajpiano> i think we're still planning for thurs on a bunch of these sites
[13:09:26] <ajpiano> gnarf: i also wanted to talk to you about irc.*
[13:09:30] <kswedberg> ajpiano: I'll do my best.
[13:09:38] <ajpiano> ok, thank
[13:10:11] <gnarf> ajpiano: yesh?
[13:10:27] <ajpiano> so we ... need to do DNS for it
[13:10:33] <ajpiano> it's not set up yet
[13:10:34] <gnarf> yup
[13:10:37] <ajpiano> and we also need to do the redirects
[13:10:43] <gnarf> irc.jquery.org yes?
[13:10:49] <ajpiano> gnarf: since it's basically done i kind of want to announce IRC with the other sites
[13:10:54] <ajpiano> cause i link to it in other docs
[13:10:57] <ajpiano> yep
[13:11:06] <gnarf> ajpiano: what are we doing about the current "logs" portion of that
[13:11:09] <ajpiano> and then the other piece is to make the old logs
[13:11:10] <ajpiano> exactly
[13:11:30] <ajpiano> i don't really know how the logs actually get there
[13:11:56] <ajpiano> i guess i want for us to leave the #whatever directories serving the same content
[13:12:00] <ajpiano> but doing so from .org not .com
[13:13:07] <gnarf> ajpiano: we could proxy the request to the old server ... services.jquery.com currently handles that
[13:13:24] <ajpiano> yeah, sounds... fine to me
[13:14:29] <gnarf> ajpiano: would we have a better way of handling it?
[13:14:47] <ajpiano> ummm
[13:14:49] <ajpiano> nothing short term
[13:15:06] <ajpiano> if it involves doing it with redirects and proxies etc
[13:15:12] <ajpiano> i would leave that to your judgment
[13:15:25] <ajpiano> and a more long term solution would be to add the IRC logs into wordpress
[13:15:39] <ajpiano> but we can only do that after we pull this pie out of the sky
[13:15:55] <gnarf> sure
[13:16:20] <gnarf> it is irc....org right?

[14:09:51] <scott_gonzalez> Stepping away for a bit. Call me if you need anything.
[14:15:25] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I agree
[14:18:00] <gnarf> ajpiano: should I switch things over to irc.jquery.com now?
[14:18:05] <gnarf> ajpiano: or is this a tomorrow thing
[14:18:09] <ajpiano> s/to/from
[14:18:18] <gnarf> yeah sorry
[14:18:23] <gnarf> should i put irc on wordpress now
[14:18:26] <ajpiano> gnarf: it can happen asap
[14:18:28] <gnarf> k
[14:18:39] <gnarf> next few minutes then
[14:18:43] <ajpiano> yeah, as long as the proxying stuff is working them i'm good
[14:18:50] <ajpiano> cause right now stage.irc.jquery.org doesn't work and that would be rad
[14:19:00] <ajpiano> and then we don't need to tag irc.jquery.com repo until we're ready to publish, which is tomorrow
[14:19:05] <ajpiano> but at least can check it all out on stage
[14:30:27] <gnarf> ajpiano: http://stage.irc.jquery.org/ working on deploying the stage atm
[14:30:35] <gnarf> http://stage.irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-content
[14:30:57] <ajpiano> gnarf: AWES
[14:31:11] <gnarf> i dunno why its redirecting the url on the endpoint yet
[14:31:13] <gnarf> gotta fix that
[14:33:34] <gnarf> oh
[14:33:37] <gnarf> lack of trailing slash
[14:33:43] <gnarf> dns will fix it eventually
[14:33:46] <gnarf> http://stage.irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-content/ btw
[14:33:52] <gnarf> now, i need to fix the css 
[14:33:52] <gnarf> :)
[14:36:41] <ajpiano> which css?
[14:39:32] <gnarf> lol at the yodas: http://stage.jquery.org/team/
[14:39:42] <gnarf> ajpiano: there was an issue (404) loading irclog.css 
[14:40:08] <ajpiano> hahaha
[14:40:09] <ajpiano> ah
[14:40:34] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: what do you think of flip flopping thurs and fri of this week
[14:40:59] <ajpiano> isdoing jquery ui 1.10 on thurs, and sites on fri?
[14:41:01] <gnarf> ajpiano: can you fix the sidebar on http://stage.irc.jquery.org/ to have trailing / on those?
[14:41:06] <ajpiano> sure
[14:41:19] <ryanneufeld> so I thought "why not, i'll get a jquery Visa"
[14:41:22] <ryanneufeld> then this happened http://cl.ly/image/3f3M071e0Z3f
[14:41:25] <ryanneufeld> WAT
[14:41:39] <ajpiano> ryanneufeld: we know
[14:41:49] <gnarf> ajpiano: btw http://irc.jquery.org/
[14:41:53] <ajpiano> but rworth the credit card page neeeds to disclaim
[14:41:56] <ajpiano> the ie thing
[14:42:00] <ajpiano> cause EVERYONE is gonna be like WTF
[14:42:04] <rworth> oh yeah
[14:42:05] <rworth> we need an issue for that
[14:42:08] <rworth> for sure
[14:42:17] <ryanneufeld> well, I'll never be able to get one
[14:42:21] <rworth> I keep hoping they'll let us know they've switched systems
[14:42:31] <rworth> caus it's suppose to be early 2013/1st quarter
[14:42:33] <gnarf> rworth: "Due to the company that makes our credit cards being silly, you'll have to fake your browser out"
[14:42:36] <rworth> but it will suck in the meantime
[14:42:37] <ryanneufeld> IE doesn't exist in my house, sad face
[14:42:51] <rworth> yeah, too bad we can't like do it for them ;)
[14:43:05] <ajpiano> oh right, scott_gonzalez is afk, guess he'll give his input when he gets back :)
[14:43:08] <ryanneufeld> if they used jquery 1.9...
[14:43:30] <rworth> notice the most recent versions of these browsers they require?
[14:43:31] <rworth> yeah
[14:43:54] <gnarf> ajpiano: .com is redirecting to .org for IRC now, should I deploy what little content there is?
[14:43:56] <rworth> I guess it's 7, 8, 9 not 6, 7, 8
[14:44:00] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery-wp-content01] 15ajpiano pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/M1A9Zw

[14:44:09] <rworth> but Firefox 4 is a good indicator of just how old this system is
[14:44:35] <ajpiano> gnarf: uh... yeah
[14:44:38] <ajpiano> the site isn't announced yet
[14:44:50] <gnarf> the 4 people who find it can feel special?
[14:44:51] <ajpiano> i need to get the irc-help page merged, but i have a PR from coldhead on it
[14:44:53] <ajpiano> yeah
[14:44:57] <ajpiano> otherwise it would essentially work
[14:45:08] <ajpiano> rworth: uhm also
[14:45:16] <ajpiano> we need to prune the jquery.org menu_header
[14:45:19] <gnarf> ajpiano: one thing i noticed is that this exposes the jquery.org menu header
[14:45:23] <ajpiano> cause otherwise it'll be live on all the sudomain sites
[14:45:25] <ajpiano> haha
[14:45:28] <gnarf> heh
[14:45:29] <ajpiano> gnarf: gmta
[14:45:38] <gnarf> wtf does that one mean
[14:45:40] <ajpiano> we need to not have credit card and join etc in there till it's ready
[14:45:43] <ajpiano> great minds think alike
[14:45:46] <gnarf> ahhh
[14:46:12] <ajpiano> gnarf: actualy wait
[14:46:14] <ajpiano> this is a bug
[14:46:22] <ajpiano> there's a header for irc.jquery.org in menu_header
[14:46:27] <ajpiano> or at least there should be
[14:47:02] <ajpiano> oh man, it just ... ain't there
[14:47:16] <ajpiano> gotta add it back
[14:48:28] <gnarf> think maybe http://stage.jquery.org/meeting/ should migrate onto irc.jquery.org ?
[14:48:43] <ajpiano> not sure, really
[14:48:53] <ajpiano> it kind of makes sense on the top-level.org
[14:49:49] <gnarf> sure
[14:50:12] <gnarf> i was just thinking having a webchat somewehre on irc. makes sense
[14:50:12] <gnarf> right?
[14:51:18] <ajpiano> i think it does
[14:51:30] <ajpiano> there are some cool more modern ones we could implement
[14:52:33] <gnarf> i'd prefer to avoid something server side for it, just because... its jquery.org...
[14:52:49] <gnarf> i dunno how many connections it would pull, but probably more than freenode likes
[14:52:57] <gnarf> might as well forward to their official webchat thing
[14:53:21] <ajpiano> yeah, i suppose
[14:53:41] <gnarf> then hassle freenode to find a better webchat maybe? :)
[14:53:46] <ajpiano> lol
[14:53:55] <ajpiano> let's worry about that one on the beach
[14:54:00] <ajpiano> we have many more fish to fry
[14:54:31] <gnarf> truth
[14:54:32] <gnarf> so
[14:54:39] <gnarf> irc.jquery.org deployed just fine
[14:54:51] <ajpiano> \i have to add the menu_header
[14:56:06] <ajpiano> i may have to do it later tonight
[14:56:18] <rworth> gnarf so, ajpiano and I realized we wanna proxy all the old events sites
[14:56:20] <ajpiano> have diner plans 30 minutes away, and not wearing outside clothes yet
[14:56:55] <rworth> so we don't have to migrate them from web-events to events.jquery.org (and jquery-wp-content) since there's custom php code and stuff
[14:57:11] <rworth> but this way we can get the Jan 25th site migrated
[14:57:17] <gnarf> rworth: i suppose we can run that off of the eol's for now
[14:57:21] <rworth> so we could proxy them based on /url ?
[14:57:33] <gnarf> we could
[14:57:42] <gnarf> i just redirected every /#* link on irc to services
[14:57:43] <gnarf> so:)
[14:57:48] <rworth> eventually of course we'll want to migrate, it's just something we could punt to meet the 25th deadline
[14:57:54] <rworth> :)
[14:58:21] <rworth> these should be easy caus it's all the links in the current footer of events.jquery.org
[14:58:30] <rworth> there are 8 of them
[14:58:49] <gnarf> rworth: yeah, so long as we plan on tearing it down at some point so I can kill the old events site host
[14:58:55] <gnarf> even if "some point" is like a year from now
[14:59:13] <rworth> actually, let's just do /2010/ /2011/ and /2012/
[14:59:47] <ajpiano> le'ts just say 2012 and earlier?
[14:59:52] <ajpiano> i don't know if there are any 2009s, lol
[14:59:53] <ajpiano> are there?
[14:59:55] <ajpiano> whatever
[14:59:56] <rworth> that works
[15:00:00] <ajpiano> 2013s will be in jquery-wp-content
[15:00:12] <rworth> there are actually some old event sites that I want to pull out of archive.org
[15:00:21] <gnarf> will they all eventually be inside the events site tho?
[15:00:27] <gnarf> like this is a goal yes?
[15:00:30] <rworth> caus they were lost at some point but would be great to resurrect for posterity
[15:00:35] <rworth> all will, yes
[15:00:43] <gnarf> i'll put in a proxy band-aid if we have a long term goal of moving them all into the new shit
[15:00:48] <rworth> just not a priority to meet this Jan 25 launch
[15:00:51] <rworth> yes
[15:00:54] <gnarf> +1
[15:00:58] <rworth> proxy band-aid
[15:01:18] <rworth> and we can even choose a Feb date for that migration

[17:02:48] <DaveMethvin> next time i say i'm gonna travel to the west coast for a one-day trip and make a major blog post plus release three project updates while i'm on the road, just slap me silly
[17:03:42] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it was strange that you were hopping on a plane as you hit publish...
[17:04:48] <DaveMethvin> well it kinda worked, only a half-dozen mistakes but i think they're all sorted out ... thanks for  your help
[17:05:33] <DaveMethvin> and thanks kswedberg for the upgrade-guide update, not sure how i missed those
[17:08:07] <kswedberg> no prob, DaveMethvin. btw, your changes to the upgrade guide suggest that while $.browser is removed, .live is still only deprecated. is that intentional?
[17:09:16] <DaveMethvin> oh darn, no i meant to say it was deprecated and also removed in 1.9 ... lemme get that
[17:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: jquery-color has an invalid manifest file :-(
[17:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> Which brings up a question.
[17:10:08] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin rworth ajpiano: Please chime in.
[17:10:18] <scott_gonzalez> Right now `licenses` is a required field.
[17:10:21] <kswedberg> DaveMethvin: well, it *does* say removed in the .live's heading. But I wasn't sure when you added "and is removed in 1.9" to $.browser but not to .live
[17:10:31] <scott_gonzalez> We did that to raise the bar, and force people to provide a license.
[17:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> I just noticed that npm doesn't even list licenses as an optional field, because it does absolutely nothing with it.
[17:11:37] <DaveMethvin> i think it should be mandatory, people should know what their restrictions are up front and that field is the best way to do it. 
[17:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I just wanted to make sure people didn't think we were asking too much.
[17:12:46] <DaveMethvin> aren't most people going to copy/paste something anyway? :D
[17:12:54] <scott_gonzalez> probably :-)
[17:13:15] <ryanneufeld> like DaveMethvin implied, having a license required means that people submitting are going to think about how they want their code used.
[17:13:37] <ryanneufeld> DBAD, and GPLv2 are my favs
[17:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see the problem with jquery-color: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/2.1.0/grunt.js#L167
[17:13:40] <DaveMethvin> right, although i guess someone could put "It's complicated" in that field
[17:14:21] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: They *HAVE* to point to a URL for the license.
