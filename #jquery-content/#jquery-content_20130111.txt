[05:01:28] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ping
[05:04:01] <ajpiano> oh man
[05:04:02] <ajpiano> you slept
[05:04:04] <ajpiano> you lucky dawg
[05:07:41] <scott_gonzalez> Not very well. I feel like shit right now.
[05:08:00] <ajpiano> irony
[05:08:06] <ajpiano> i have been writing all night, i feel ok
[05:08:10] <ajpiano> but im gonna crash soon
[05:08:15] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[05:08:30] <ajpiano> i just want to get this to wherei thought i would get it to
[05:08:45] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/170
[05:08:56] <ajpiano> i saw that, didn't feel like thinking about it right now
[05:09:23] <ajpiano> why will we never upgrade normalize
[05:09:49] <ajpiano> i would feel a lot better about rtracking those things
[05:09:52] <ajpiano> if like, we were building them together
[05:09:55] <ajpiano> from separate files
[05:10:01] <ajpiano> as long as we have to do this hand maintenance stuff, it's pointless
[05:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> Upgrading normalize seems pretty high risk to me.
[05:10:26] <scott_gonzalez> It's intentionally as low level as it gets.
[05:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> Which means the widest possible impact.
[05:10:49] <scott_gonzalez> Also, "normalize" = the opposite of what we want.
[05:11:02] <scott_gonzalez> It's just wasted bytes, honestly.
[05:11:09] <ajpiano> yeah i saw this
[05:11:20] <ajpiano> and i raealised it was reversing a bunch of the stuff you just did like last week
[05:11:37] <ajpiano> and then i was like.... time to keep writing
[05:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> Also, tracking the full set of rules means declaring styles we will never use
[05:11:57] <scott_gonzalez> Not just styles we will overwrite later.
[05:13:07] <ajpiano> like i said
[05:13:14] <ajpiano> i could see tracking it, if it meant like, upgrading a file
[05:13:26] <ajpiano> and then seeing if things worked after the upgrade
[05:13:27] <scott_gonzalez> That's the least of the concerns.
[05:13:45] <scott_gonzalez> Seeing if things worked after the upgrade is a fairly big undertaking.
[05:14:00] <scott_gonzalez> It's every page type of every site in every browser.
[05:14:22] <ajpiano> this is the same type of reasoning why people don't upgrade their jquery and ui versions
[05:14:48] <scott_gonzalez> CSS is much worse.
[05:15:07] <scott_gonzalez> normalize is saying, we're going to change what it means to be every tag.
[05:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> And then on top of that, we're saying, no normalize, we're going to change that again.
[05:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> Also, how many people do you know that write tests for CSS?
[05:16:24] <ajpiano> there is something odd to me though about taking a css file
[05:16:43] <ajpiano> like, from a framework type thing
[05:17:07] <ajpiano> and then modifying it to suit your needs, and then if they introduce fixes, to not have a path to pull it in
[05:17:21] <ajpiano> i can just see a similar thing happening with the ui css framework
[05:17:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's start bigger.
[05:17:30] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i'm sort of playing devils advocate
[05:17:31] <scott_gonzalez> Would you ever upgrade H5BP on an existing project?
[05:18:01] <ajpiano> depends what that mean
[05:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> We're using at least some stuff from H5BP.
[05:18:23] <scott_gonzalez> We will never upgrade it.
[05:18:24] <ajpiano> i would certainly upgrade the dependencies as new versions came out
[05:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be near impossible.
[05:18:33] <ajpiano> i upgraded our modernizr version like 2 days ago
[05:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> I veiw modernizr as a very different type of library.
[05:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> Upgrading modernizr is super low risk.
[05:19:32] <scott_gonzalez> And is actually useful.
[05:19:37] <scott_gonzalez> Upgrading normalize is generally not useful.
[05:19:43] <ajpiano> right
[05:19:55] <ajpiano> this is an "if it ain't broke" kinda thing
[05:19:56] <scott_gonzalez> We can easily cherry-pick bug fixes if we actually encounter problems.

[05:22:09] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like a decision now. Because not reverting today means it's going to get harder and harder to revert.
[05:22:36] <ajpiano> i agree w/ you that we should revert now
[05:22:53] <ajpiano> if we want to pick back up the normalize upgrade thing, it can be done later
[05:23:02] <ajpiano> right now is a weird time to tilt the apple cart on something like this

[05:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Do we want the default category page to show full posts or just excerpts?
[05:57:13] <ajpiano> on what sites. APIs?
[05:57:30] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I'm working on the category and tag pages for the plugins site.
[05:57:32] <ajpiano> oh , plugins
[05:57:32] <ajpiano> yeah
[05:57:34] <ajpiano> sorry
[05:57:36] <scott_gonzalez> But while I'm doing that, I want to implement the default one.
[05:57:49] <scott_gonzalez> So I'm wondering whether the default should show the full content or just an excerpt.
[05:57:53] <ajpiano> excerpts, i presume
[05:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, that's what I think too.
[05:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> The default theme still has a ton of "broken" templates.
[05:58:38] <scott_gonzalez> So whenever I work on a new template type for a site, I try to update the base to match.
[05:58:50] <scott_gonzalez> Usually in hopes that the site I'm working on won't end up with an override :-P
[05:58:55] <rworth> hey
[05:59:10] <scott_gonzalez> So if we're doing excerpts, I can probably get away with not overriding for plugins.
[05:59:15] <scott_gonzalez> hey rworth
[05:59:27] <rworth> so here's how I ended up here
[05:59:38] <rworth> I was working on jquery.org and I had some crazy styles in an input
[05:59:41] <rworth> placeholder and focu
[05:59:45] <rworth> bright red
[05:59:48] <rworth> ugly
[05:59:53] <rworth> I was like, where are those from?
[05:59:57] <rworth> so I look in base.css
[06:00:00] <rworth> find them
[06:00:06] <rworth> look down, see font awesome
[06:00:10] <rworth> look up, see normalize header
[06:00:27] <rworth> then in the header of base.css I see notes that base.css includes normalize and font awesome
[06:01:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, to make the copyright and licensing clear.
[06:01:19] <rworth> so I compare normalize 1.0.1 to what we have and we're saying is 1.0.1 and I find we have taken things out (fine), added things (I believe should be done after), changed things (should be done after), and added things that are totally unrelated (should definately be done after)
[06:02:01] <rworth> I have no problem with you saying "this is the version we're going with, and we've removed these parts of it that are extra useless code to us"
[06:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> Here's the thing though: We don't care about normalize's results.
[06:02:51] <scott_gonzalez> Normalizing may be a goal, but the output of normalize.css is absolutely not our goal.
[06:02:57] <rworth> but putting our own changes between the beginning of normalize and the end only ensures future pain if we a) want to see what the differences are b) wanted to consider upgrading or cherry-picking something
[06:03:06] <scott_gonzalez> Our goal is to style elements to our design.
[06:03:07] <rworth> the same day normalize 1.0.1 was released, 2.0.1 was released
[06:03:16] <rworth> which drops support for versions of IE we no longer support
[06:03:50] <rworth> so, like, we'd get more savings by upgrading to 2.0.2 (though I do get that would take a ton of testing, I support not doing that now if ever for that reason)
[06:04:29] <rworth> I just don't want to do with normalize.css what we would never let someone do with jquery.js
[06:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> Why?
[06:05:02] <rworth> you were saying before normalize is low-level
[06:05:03] <rworth> I agree
[06:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean by "we would never let someone do with jquery.js"
[06:05:29] <scott_gonzalez> Surely we encourage people ripping jQuery apart and replacing it with their own parts.
[06:05:35] <rworth> if we accept it as a base (that we build on) then it goes on top of browser default styles just like jQuery goes on top of the dop
[06:05:37] <rworth> dom
[06:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually a design goal of current jQuery.
[06:05:46] <rworth> sure
[06:05:51] <rworth> but not by modifying jquery.js
[06:05:57] <scott_gonzalez> umm...
[06:06:01] <rworth> or if someone said, I'm sticking with jQuery 1.5, never gonna upgrade
[06:06:02] <rworth> fine
[06:06:03] <scott_gonzalez> That's debatable.
[06:06:07] <rworth> but if they had a copy of that in their code
[06:06:17] <rworth> they shoudn't extend it by modifying those lines
[06:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> Why not?
[06:06:26] <rworth> they should extend it with lines following
[06:06:31] <scott_gonzalez> Or replace it.
[06:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> Which is what we're doing.
[06:06:50] <scott_gonzalez> There's no difference between modifying 20/50 lines and replacing 50 lines with 50 lines.
[06:07:57] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery has clear lines of modularity.
[06:08:03] <rworth> if this code were in a file called normalize.css with a neat copyright header would you support us making the changes in that file, even if we put something at the top that says "we have made changes to this"
[06:08:05] <rworth> I wouldn't
[06:08:09] <ajpiano> i think what rworth is saying is that if someone took jquery and just modified the source to suit their neeeds
[06:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> You can do what you want with any single module and have a perfectly clear upgrade path for all other modules.
[06:08:20] <ajpiano> and then put it in the middle of a concatenated js file
[06:08:25] <ajpiano> but with a normal jquery header
[06:08:35] <scott_gonzalez> That's not an equivalent argument.
[06:08:44] <ajpiano> and then someone encountered that and wondered why the hell jquery wasn't working how they expected
[06:08:45] <scott_gonzalez> Also, we don't have a normal header here.
[06:08:52] <rworth> but I thought we did
[06:09:15] <rworth> which is why I spent an hour trying to find the problem and two hours fixing it. That work done, we have marginally more code than before and it's more maintainable
[06:09:30] <rworth> because the code we take from normalize (doesn't have to be all of it) is unchanged and does its thing
[06:09:39] <rworth> and our code that comes after it may add to or override
[06:09:45] <scott_gonzalez> So normalize fixed your problem?
[06:09:49] <rworth> but it's clear that normalize comes before and our code comes after
[06:09:52] <rworth> no
[06:10:05] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so again, I ask why we ever need to upgrade normalize.
[06:10:15] <ajpiano> we don't have to
[06:10:22] <rworth> my problem was I needed (need) to change a line that was mixed up between a bunch of stuff from normalize above and below
[06:10:34] <rworth> but it turns out the lines I need to change are normalization css at all
[06:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> Your problem is that you thought normalize mattered.
[06:10:43] <rworth> they are base css styles that are part of our design
[06:11:04] <rworth> my problem is that we had normalization code and then style code and then more normalization code
[06:11:16] <scott_gonzalez> Ignore the fact that normalize.css exists.
[06:11:24] <scott_gonzalez> The code at the top is OUR SET OF BASE STYLES.
[06:11:25] <rworth> you shouldn't ever have that, regardless of whether you're tracking a library (and I don't care if we never do)
[06:11:41] <scott_gonzalez> Getting back to base 0 is not a goal.
[06:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> It never was and never will be.
[06:12:35] <scott_gonzalez> If we had written this from scratch, we'd end up with the same exact thing.
[06:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> We wouldn't have separate rules just for fixing bugs.
[06:12:46] <rworth> and I'd make the same argument
[06:12:47] <scott_gonzalez> That's absurd.
[06:12:58] <rworth> the position of rules in the css makes a difference
[06:13:01] <rworth> not at all
[06:13:08] <scott_gonzalez> That argument would mean that every single time we deal with a browser quirk, we should split out the rules.
[06:14:02] <rworth> it's quite different if you're talking about a browser quirk that affects one of our styles vs the built-in html elements
[06:14:12] <rworth> back to your point about the low-level nature of normalize
[06:14:32] <rworth> for just that reason, whether there's a normalize.js or not, those low-level things should be up-front
[06:14:38] <rworth> and site styles should follow
[06:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> So, I just spent 5 seconds looking at the README
[06:14:43] <scott_gonzalez> "It's suggested that you read the normalize.css file and consider customising it to meet your needs."
[06:14:46] <rworth> base styles first, then each site specific file
[06:15:01] <rworth> right
[06:15:21] <scott_gonzalez> So Nicolas himself suggests changing the rules rather than overriding later.
[06:15:24] <rworth> we don't need to put rules in normalize that have #content inside it
[06:15:25] <rworth> ever
[06:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> "Alternatively, include the file in your project and override the defaults later in your CSS."
[06:15:37] <rworth> because that set of rules is and should remain browser normalization
[06:15:46] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: No. We have those for a reason.
[06:15:50] <rworth> that's my only argument and that was the impetus of my commit
[06:15:54] <scott_gonzalez> If you remove the #content, you'll regress some stuff.
[06:16:11] <rworth> fine, then can they be in a section on their own following the normalize code, not in the middle of it?
[06:16:19] <rworth> I didn't remove it
[06:16:21] <rworth> I moved it down
[06:16:32] <scott_gonzalez> Moving those down is fine.
[06:16:43] <rworth> all I did was refactor base.css so our code followed normalize.css instead of being inter-mixed
[06:16:55] <rworth> and I preserved the removal of the lines from normalize.css you had made
[06:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> Some of our rules should be mixed in though.
[06:17:08] <rworth> which is why I did a sep. issue for upgrading to 1.0.1, rather than doing it
[06:17:11] <rworth> so we could discuss it
[06:17:19] <rworth> and yet a sep. issue for 1.0.1 to 2.0.1
[06:17:31] <rworth> sounds like we can close those two issues and revert the revert ;)
[06:17:43] <rworth> I don't feel it's worth it, personally
[06:17:56] <rworth> but I understand your argument
[06:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> We should not revert the revert.
[06:18:54] <rworth> and I have much much much less issue with our own margin/padding on fieldsets or uls than putting our own form field styles into the section confusing us/others as to whether those styles are/were part of something this low-level
[06:19:25] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't matter if it *was* part of normalize.
[06:20:11] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15Cito opened issue #213: Make documentation of jQuery.contains() more clear  02http://git.io/FkMRfA
[06:20:12] <scott_gonzalez> What we have now (without your change) is rules in a sane order (excluding anything that starts with #content in the top).
[06:21:11] <rworth> so the #content stuff can move down?
[06:21:37] <scott_gonzalez> It can, though I don't really see how it improves maintainability.
[06:21:45] <scott_gonzalez> Right now the rules are grouped based on element types.
[06:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> Also, as far as I can tell, the only rule we're talking about is:
[06:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> #content input[type=text],
[06:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> #content textarea {
[06:22:52] <rworth> but #content textarea is not a normalization
[06:23:08] <scott_gonzalez> THIS IS NOT ABOUT NORMALIZATION
[06:23:09] <rworth> are there styles in there that are working around browser inconsistencies?
[06:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> That's the whole point.
[06:23:20] <scott_gonzalez> Please ignore the fact that we're using normalize.css.
[06:23:28] <scott_gonzalez> We're not using it for normalization.
[06:23:29] <rworth> it can be about normalization without it having to be normalize.css
[06:23:38] <scott_gonzalez> We don't need a section about normalize.
[06:23:38] <rworth> we are
[06:23:41] <rworth> because it's there
[06:24:00] <rworth> it is our base, because of how low-level it is and because it's first
[06:24:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's a section for defining how element types are displayed.
[06:24:50] <scott_gonzalez> The fact that we care about that specifically within the content area doesn't really have anything to do with the content area itself.
[06:24:57] <scott_gonzalez> It's not about layout, it's about element styles.
[06:25:17] <scott_gonzalez> That whole section is about that, including the rules after, like .radio.
[06:25:40] <rworth> ok, then I'd argue that all styles that are only about element types come before styles that include more information than just the type
[06:25:46] <rworth> including #content section
[06:25:54] <rworth> er textarea
[06:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> I really can't have this discussion any longer.
[06:26:20] <rworth> ok
[06:26:29] <rworth> clearly I was confused because
[06:26:37] <rworth> 1) we had a section called normalize
[06:26:51] <rworth> 2) we had a section (happened to be the same) saying it came from normalize.css
[06:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have a section called normalize.
[06:27:07] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have a section saying it came from normalize.css.
[06:27:21] <scott_gonzalez> We have a header that says somewhere in this massive file is code that originally came from normalize.css.
[06:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> Nowhere in base.css does it say anything related to "The following is from normalize.css"
[06:28:06] <rworth> then fault me for assuming that the only references to external libs was at the top and both external libs were at the top, first and second, and they seemed unmodified except for changes it seemed (to me) could sit below, as they could build on top of what we got from external rather than modifying it directly
[06:28:10] <rworth> I think we can move on 
[06:28:51] <rworth> right, so since I assumed it was, and it wasn't *that* far off from that, my commit got us to that, and I don't think it cost too much
[06:29:04] <rworth> but I can see your argument for how it segments those styles
[06:29:13] <rworth> about similar/same element types
[06:29:19] <rworth> some above font awesome and some below
[06:38:39] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquery.com01] 15kswedberg pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/0JpWww
[06:38:39] <jqcommit> 13api.jquery.com/06master 14ff88a02 15Karl Swedberg: jQuery.contains(): Clarify language....
[06:40:20] <rworth> so, I think I found the problem. The placeholder color is #FF0000 and the focus outline is #B24926
[06:40:35] <rworth> this is for input and textarea
[06:40:43] <rworth> neither seems the right base style
[06:41:07] <rworth> seems #B24926 is a jQuery UI color. That's the background of its #container
[06:42:14] <rworth> so I landed here because this is the line making the input ugly on jquery.org. Rather than override it with a jquery.org style, should we set a better jquery.com+jquery.org default style? something blue ajpiano ?
[06:43:38] <ajpiano> where are there inputs on jquery.org
[06:44:27] <rworth>  /join just added one for email address
[06:44:57] <rworth> didn't commit yet
[06:45:22] <ajpiano> i had to set some default input styles today for oldIE
[06:45:26] <ajpiano> i went with just #333
[06:45:32] <ajpiano> something neutral that'll work everywhere
[06:45:41] <rworth> that may be a bit dark for a placeholder
[06:45:45] <ajpiano> right
[06:45:47] <ajpiano> but you see what i'm saying
[06:45:50] <rworth> and is likely too dark for a focus outline as well
[06:45:56] <ajpiano> an eutral not a colour
[06:45:57] <rworth> thought that may depend on the background
[06:46:45] <rworth> or like link color, it could be site-specific
[06:47:24] <ajpiano> yeah

[07:00:36] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, now that I removed $sidebar since it wasn't used anywhere, I think I need to use it :-P
[07:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> I've got big plans to remove a bunch of one-off templates.
[07:01:05] <ajpiano> you guys
[07:01:30] <ajpiano> http://stage.contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/ http://stage.contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/
[07:01:47] <rworth> niiiice
[07:01:51] <scott_gonzalez> whoa, content :-)
[07:02:03] <rworth> purdy
[07:02:12] <ajpiano> oh man
[07:02:22] <ajpiano> thats what i ve been doing since i fixed the jquery grunt thing
[07:05:15] <ajpiano> hey kswedberg
[07:05:27] <ajpiano> are you a round
[07:05:30] <ajpiano> or are you a squareeeee
[07:05:32] <kswedberg> hey ajpiano. yeah.
[07:05:34] <kswedberg> :)
[07:05:37] <kswedberg> both
[07:05:42] <ajpiano> do you think you could help out with https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/issues/8
[07:06:34] <kswedberg> sure
[07:06:56] <ajpiano> awesome, can i assign you the issue
[07:07:09] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Thoughts on changing the base sidebar.php to just show up to 2 levels of categories, like the API sites do?
[07:07:24] <kswedberg> I was just trying to get my local jquery* sites working after the repo change to jquery-wp-content
[07:07:24] <ajpiano> a lot of the nitty gritty stuff is covered in the web sites page and the commits page now
[07:07:37] <scott_gonzalez> NOBODY is using the base right now, since it doe the Arhcives/Meta thing.
[07:07:38] <ajpiano> i ccan give you a hand with that
[07:07:40] <rworth> scott_gonzalez that would be the default sidebar?
[07:07:46] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: yeah
[07:07:48] <kswedberg> sure, ajpiano, assign the issue to me.
[07:07:50] <rworth> sounds good
[07:07:58] <scott_gonzalez> Pretty much every site is overriding sidebar.
[07:08:15] <ajpiano> yeah the current default sidebar is useless
[07:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> Does anyone know what this does? dynamic_sidebar( 'sidebar-1' )
[07:08:46] <scott_gonzalez> Should we just remove the dynamic_sidebar() stuff?
[07:08:52] <rworth> we don't use that
[07:08:55] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:09:02] <rworth> it's for if you drag-and-drop with jQuery UI in wp-admin
[07:10:21] <scott_gonzalez> ah, ok
[07:10:32] <scott_gonzalez> So, this is gonna be a nice change when I get to a point where I can commit.
[07:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> I've got api.jquery.com using the default category.php and no custom sidebar now.
[07:11:29] <scott_gonzalez> And I've got it to the point where the only difference is the title now says "Category Archives: Ajax" instead of just "Ajax"
[07:11:38] <scott_gonzalez> So, what do we want to show for the category page titles?
[07:12:08] <rworth> Category: Ajax?
[07:12:18] <scott_gonzalez> works for me
[07:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> I also don't like the word Archive :-)
[07:12:45] <rworth> it only makes sense in terms of historical blog posts
[07:13:01] <scott_gonzalez> right
[07:18:27] <ajpiano> kswedberg: boom, assigned
[07:18:31] <ajpiano> do you need a hand with your local?
[07:19:04] <kswedberg> thx, ajpiano. I'm kind of juggling that and work work right now, so my mind is all over the place.
[07:19:07] <ajpiano> kswedberg: basically after the rename, the manual steps you have to do are
[07:19:15] <ajpiano> rename the actual folder itself
[07:19:21] <ajpiano> and go to wp-config.php
[07:19:39] <ajpiano> and edit like, the line near the bottom, where it explicitly refers to "web-base-template" and change it to "jquery-wp-content"
[07:19:49] <kswedberg> aha!
[07:20:02] <ajpiano> yeah that's teh secret sauce, cuase that file isn't version controled
[07:20:09] <kswedberg> that did the trick! thanks a lot.
[07:20:22] <ajpiano> you scratcha my backa i scratcha yours
[07:20:34] <ajpiano> :p

[07:20:48] <kswedberg> :)
[07:37:49] <ajpiano> https://twitter.com/calvintennant/status/289538444080840704
[07:38:02] <ajpiano> but this was really the best
[07:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> The grid has padding on every colum and margin on the row.
[07:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> It has the concept of a collapsed row where the padding and margin are removed.
[07:39:08] <ajpiano> https://twitter.com/r_shaq/status/289635333413404673
[07:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> But I've got a situation where I don't want the margin to go away.
[07:39:36] <scott_gonzalez> So I want to add a new class that will collapse a column, not the whole row.
[07:39:39] <scott_gonzalez> Any objection to that?
[07:40:44] <ajpiano> i'm trying to find what you're talking about
[07:41:12] <ajpiano> what do you mean by collapse a column
[07:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> I'll show you the problem I'm running into with screenshots.
[07:41:55] <ajpiano> yeah
[07:42:06] <ajpiano> or you can push a branch
[07:42:09] <ajpiano> wat evs
[07:42:12] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/110L3m0X2u2B
[07:42:13] <rworth> ajpiano that's awesome
[07:42:26] <scott_gonzalez> The content is 8/4
[07:42:40] <scott_gonzalez> But you can see the content is indented because there's padding on each column.
[07:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> If I collapse the row, then the margin goes away and the last column moves out: http://cl.ly/image/2D2X2N3n2s3n
[07:43:53] <ajpiano> oh man
[07:44:00] <ajpiano> the collapse stuff is their own thing on top of zurbs
[07:44:07] <ajpiano> i was looking at the actual zurb docs
[07:44:08] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[07:44:27] <ajpiano> yeah
[07:44:38] <ajpiano> Based on Zurb Foundation's Grid
[07:44:38] <ajpiano> */
[07:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see where this is being used.
[07:45:21] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: all i know right this sec is that zurb supports offset
[07:45:43] <ajpiano> and it feels like you could use that
[07:45:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually not used anywhere.
[07:45:53] <scott_gonzalez> Only be me in the plugins site trying to deal with the padding.
[07:46:11] <scott_gonzalez> So if there's a proper way to do this, we can remove the collapse rules.
[07:46:41] <ajpiano> that's what i'm thinking
[07:46:43] <ajpiano> whats's the markup
[07:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: collapse is part of Zurb: https://github.com/zurb/foundation/blob/master/scss/foundation/components/_grid.scss
[07:47:35] <ajpiano> yeah but the docs don't tell you how to use it http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/grid.php
[07:47:47] <ajpiano> so i didn't know that, but i also don't undersand how you're supposed to use it
[07:48:15] <ajpiano> which is why imade that assumption
[07:48:38] <scott_gonzalez> It's kind of like border-collapse.
[07:48:44] <scott_gonzalez> It just kills all the spacing.
[07:49:36] <scott_gonzalez> The problem is just that if we're going to nest grids for individual item layouts, we'll want to kill the left-padding on the first item and the right-padding on the last item.
[07:49:44] <ajpiano> by that screenshot, t looks like there's padding
[07:49:50] <ajpiano> on the containery thing
[07:49:56] <ajpiano> which is causing it to move out
[07:50:19] <ajpiano> i kind of want to play with the markup a bit
[07:50:47] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...so the grid is fixed width.
[07:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, sort of.
[07:51:01] <ajpiano> yeah it's weird
[07:51:01] <scott_gonzalez> So that's part of my problem.
[07:51:06] <ajpiano> like the outermost row is fixed width
[07:51:16] <ajpiano> but then when you nest, it fits nicely
[07:51:20] <ajpiano> IIRC
[07:51:42] <ajpiano> i guess..my gut is that it can be solved without having to use collapse or screw with the defaults
[07:51:53] <ajpiano> but i unno
[07:52:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, I see the problem.
[07:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> This isn't a nested row.
[07:52:38] <scott_gonzalez> We're apparently not using the grid for the main layout.
[07:52:40] <ajpiano> i haven't run had content in my local plugins install in a long time
[07:52:52] <ajpiano> ah
[07:53:23] <scott_gonzalez> That makes the grid pretty hard to use.
[07:53:51] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like we just got totally screwed with our style guide.
[07:54:20] <ajpiano> well incidentally
[07:54:31] <ajpiano> i am kind of feeling crazy enough to take a pass of that
[07:54:48] <ajpiano> i want to try and move their brand guide into a page in brand.jquery.org
[07:55:13] <ajpiano> and kind of bring those two things together into one thing that ya know, works
[07:55:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:56:04] <ajpiano> they (nelson cash) made some typography decisions in the brand site that are worth incorporating into base
[07:56:12] <ajpiano> and then there are places wher i want to dial it back a drop
[07:56:19] <ajpiano> so i'll experiement with it
[07:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like there's no good way for me to do this.
[07:56:46] <scott_gonzalez> I need to just write one-off styles.
[07:56:57] <ajpiano> can't you just use the grid on the main layout
[07:58:05] <scott_gonzalez> Umm...well, yes, but will I get anything else done today if I do that?
[07:59:10] <ajpiano> i donno
[07:59:36] <ajpiano> it's worth a shot jsut to see if just making the outermost thing into a <div class="twelve columns">
[07:59:44] <ajpiano> and seeing if off the bat, things break horrendously
[08:00:06] <ajpiano> THEOITCALLY if the nesting works as advertised that might just magically work
[08:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> It won't.
[08:00:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's gonna add padding and margin to the whole thing.
[08:00:35] <ajpiano> ah
[08:00:37] <scott_gonzalez> We can override that.
[08:00:53] <scott_gonzalez> But we can't use .collapse because then all nested grids would be collapsed.
[08:01:18] <ajpiano> but we wouldn't need it, cause the inner guys would behave properly cause they're inside of a row

[08:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Open contribute.jquery.org, add row to content-wrapper and twelve columns to content-right
[08:08:11] <rworth> don't you hate it when you ammend a commit message to fix one type only to add a different one
[08:08:15] <rworth> typo
[08:08:24] * rworth can't even spell typo right
[08:08:26] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: rworth i actually think that http://jquery.github.com/brand.jquery.org makes more sense inside of contribute than brand
[08:08:28] <ajpiano> strangely enough
[08:08:36] <ajpiano> what do you guys think
[08:08:38] <rworth> ajpiano yeah, that works
[08:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:08:42] <rworth> but they should link to eachother
[08:08:45] <ajpiano> at this point, it's basically like the HTML style guide
[08:08:49] <ajpiano> yeah, they definitely will
[08:08:49] <rworth> yup
[08:09:18] <ajpiano> but once it's stripped of all the stuff that actually belongs in bbrand it definely is "how to layout a webpage in jquery-wp-content"
[08:09:18] <ajpiano> ok
[08:09:21] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: gonna try that
[08:09:43] * rworth is loving GitHubs new drag-and-drop support for images in issues
[08:10:59] <scott_gonzalez> If you remove the max-width on content-wrapper, it gets bette.r
[08:10:59] <ajpiano> ok scott_gonzalez i see it
[08:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> But we're still doubling up on padding.
[08:11:43] <scott_gonzalez> We could change the padding on content-wrapper to 20px 0
[08:11:59] <scott_gonzalez> That might get us pretty close to what we'd need.
[08:12:04] <ajpiano> i was just screwing around with that
[08:12:23] <ajpiano> it still explodes out of the top though
[08:12:43] <ajpiano> horizontally
[08:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> What does?
[08:13:25] <scott_gonzalez> The sidebar?
[08:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, we should probably do it for real and use the columns to set the sidebar.
[08:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> It just seems like the rabbit hole is deep.
[08:14:45] <rworth> ajpiano are https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/151 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/169 duplicates ?
[08:14:50] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: http://cl.ly/image/2E1S1T0e2o2A
[08:14:58] <ajpiano> yeah, i hate how the sidebar padding and all that is implemeent
[08:15:03] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I don't have that sidebar.
[08:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> What am I missing?
[08:15:07] <ajpiano> it's like freakin padding all over the place doing all sorts of unholy god
[08:15:16] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: ohhh
[08:15:25] <ajpiano> you may have to refresh the thing
[08:15:28] <ajpiano> theme
[08:15:31] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: can you view-source
[08:15:58] <ajpiano> check to see if the links in the header are actually referring to the contribute.jquery.org
[08:16:05] <ajpiano> theme
[08:16:24] <scott_gonzalez> some are pointing at .com.
[08:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> What do I need to do?
[08:16:40] <ajpiano> go to the wp-admin
[08:16:56] <ajpiano> and in the network admin, re-activate the contribute.jquery.org theme
[08:17:02] <ajpiano> it says it's active, but it's confused
[08:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> o_O
[08:17:19] <ajpiano> if you were to go to wp_admin for contirbute.jquery.org right now
[08:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> http://dev.contribute.jquery.com/wp-admin redirects to .com
[08:17:30] <ajpiano> it would say that it can't find the jquery hteme and it would be using twenty twelve
[08:17:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you need to go to /wp-admin/network and edit the site to be .org again
[08:17:47] <ajpiano> ^^
[08:18:39] <ajpiano> rworth: they're not dupes, but 151 is closed now
[08:18:46] <rworth> thanks
[08:19:06] <rworth> do we have a clean way of doing .js per site like we have .css per site?
[08:19:23] <rworth> I don't wanna just shove a bunch of .org/join js in main.js (there's already a little)
[08:19:32] <rworth> esp. when it depends on a 3rd party script
[08:19:48] <rworth> which leads to my other question. Should I just add that 3rd party script to the content page
[08:21:03] <ajpiano> putting scripts in content pages kind of gives me the heebie jeebies
[08:21:07] <rworth> me too
[08:21:08] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Just put the code in main.js for now. Put the 3rd party script in plugins.js.
[08:21:20] <rworth> ok
[08:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, got my site working properly now.
[08:26:02] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: http://cl.ly/image/0v3V371z000E
[08:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> It's actually just removing a bunch of rules and then tweaking some numbers.
[08:26:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'll play with this and see how much work it is to update all the sites.
[08:26:47] <ajpiano> nice
[08:26:48] <ajpiano> ok
[08:27:35] <rworth> that doubles the size of plugins.js, so at some point we may want to optimize. but this'll do for now. thanks

[08:57:06] <rworth> sort of
[08:58:02] <ajpiano> heh
[08:58:05] <rworth> all it would take would be to take the token we get from stripe and send it to stripe and the card would be charged, but we need to do subscriptions, which means using the stripe API to create a customer and subscribing the customer to a plan
[08:58:08] <ajpiano> what's the deal with the miage in the banner covering the menu
[08:58:21] <rworth> but that's just two more api calls
[08:58:39] <rworth> and I've got someone lined up to help out with that, supposed to have a call with them today
[08:59:01] <rworth> oh, and we're using Stripe now, not PayPal
[08:59:35] <ajpiano> i guess that tweet went somewhere, eh
[08:59:37] <rworth> looked into it again yesterday and talked to someone from Stripe on the phone for like 30min. It's def. the right system
[08:59:40] <rworth> yeah, exactly

[09:29:56] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: What prompted the switch to Swipe?
[09:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> Just curious since it seemed like Adam D didn't really want to move away from PayPal.
[09:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> Which I thought was odd.
[09:45:05] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: As part of this switch to using the grid for layout, I'm tightening up some more spacing.
[09:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> 40px -> 25px on the sides of the content area.
[09:45:31] <ajpiano> yeah, that 40 is too much
[09:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to be touching a lot of templates to do this.
[09:48:16] <ajpiano> no time like the present
[09:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...brand has a page tempate that never shows the page title.
[09:50:28] <scott_gonzalez> We could use the default page template and add a hook that always sets the custom field to hide the page title for brand.
[09:50:38] <scott_gonzalez> Or, can we just show the page titles?
[09:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see, it's always using a banner.
[09:51:27] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see if I can write a hook to always set this flag for brand so we can use the default template.
[09:52:10] <ajpiano> adding the hide_title metadata to all the pages wouldn't be terrible
[09:52:14] <ajpiano> but it's easy enough to do it in the gruntfile
[09:52:23] <ajpiano> importing the html guide is actually going way better than i expecte
[09:55:56] <ajpiano> why the hell red is the default color for inputs i have no idea
[09:57:12] <ajpiano> ah for placeholder
[09:58:20] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I'm actually trying to do this inside WordPress so that we don't need to actually set hide_title.
[09:58:30] <scott_gonzalez> Trying to apply a filter to get_post_metadata() :-)
[09:58:34] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: oh, where,
[09:58:36] <ajpiano> ah
[09:59:04] <scott_gonzalez> Unfortunately I'm failing at it.
[09:59:19] <ajpiano> oohh
[09:59:30] <ajpiano> i set the placeholder color to be sizzle red instead of f00
[09:59:43] <ajpiano> so much better
[10:01:05] <scott_gonzalez> The filter doesn't seem to be receiving any data.
[10:01:11] <scott_gonzalez> Makes it hard to do something useful.
[10:01:21] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: why don't you set it in the grunt preprocess hook
[10:01:24] <ajpiano> that's what it's for
[10:01:29] <ajpiano> adding metadata
[10:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'll go do that now.
[10:02:31] <ajpiano> lol scott_gonzalez you know where this is a quote from
[10:02:41] <ajpiano> The main goal of typography is that hopefully you won't need to add a class to an element to style it.
[10:03:02] <scott_gonzalez> no, where?

[10:12:06] <ajpiano> you stone cold
[10:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> Do you know if any sites are using the default index.php?
[10:14:32] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like sites are either using the static index plugin or have a custom index.php
[10:14:42] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure where to go to test a change to this template.
[10:15:19] <ajpiano> yah, i'm not sure anything is using the default
[10:15:24] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:18:17] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...this is weird.
[10:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> This change causes the beta ribbon on learn to move.
[10:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/2n1W2d0c1W20
[10:19:12] <ajpiano> i might be putting that in the template in a not-good spot
[10:19:38] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah, it's inside the content and using absolute positioning.
[10:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> The row must be relative or something.
[10:19:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'll move it.
[10:21:07] <ajpiano> yeah, it has to move in 2 places unfortunately, one in the content, and the rest in the template
[10:23:15] <scott_gonzalez> Is it in multiple content pages or just the home page?

[10:37:30] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, so the result of my commit is every site should look almost exactly the same. Except for the plugins site, which now looks like shit :-P

[11:28:20] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/9d8b3.png
[11:28:21] <scott_gonzalez> a headache?
[11:29:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's a system call for executing files.
[11:29:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's an unhelpful error message :-P
[11:29:55] <danheberden> ah, like childprocess.execFile ?
[11:30:03] <scott_gonzalez> maybe?
[11:30:08] <danheberden> hmm
[11:30:22] <scott_gonzalez> I remember getting an error like that a long time ago.
[11:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember how I tracked it down.
[11:31:08] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try deploying locally.
[11:33:22] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...deployed fine for me.
[11:33:32] <danheberden> weird
[11:33:47] <danheberden> also, why are we back to prefixing our repo's with 'jquery'
[11:33:48] <danheberden> :/
[11:33:54] <danheberden> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content
[11:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> Try cd'ing into node_modules/download.jqueryui.com
[11:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> And running `grunt prepare`
[11:34:34] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Because it sites alongside the built-in wp-content.
[11:35:02] <scott_gonzalez> It is the wp-content for jQuery sites.
[11:35:25] <danheberden> yes, i am aware - just like jqueryui.com is a site for jquery
[11:35:38] <danheberden> it's obvs too late to change
[11:36:09] <scott_gonzalez> Except that jqueryui.com doesn't have ambiguity.
[11:36:14] <danheberden> i was wanting to mention having the two dirs adjacent to eac other
[11:36:23] <danheberden> for the install
[11:36:37] <danheberden> so that one repo isn't in the local install of wp
[11:36:48] <danheberden> either way, i digress
[11:36:54] <danheberden> just - i worked hard on having strong repo names
[11:37:02] <danheberden> so bummed about seeing jquery/jquery ever
[11:37:20] <ajpiano> we bikeshedded the repo name like twice in the last week
[11:37:23] <scott_gonzalez> jquery/jquery is actually imprortant for forks.
[11:37:46] <scott_gonzalez> jquery/ui would've been a horrible naming convention for our repos.
[11:38:12] <danheberden> ok, then i'll stop being the one that manages github naming stuff
[11:38:27] <danheberden> or is responsible for it, rather

[11:42:54] <ajpiano> still needs work for sure
[11:42:59] <ajpiano> but it's basically ok
[11:43:10] <ajpiano> we can kill jquery.github.com as soon as contribute launches
[11:43:21] <ajpiano> i really should have slept a little
[11:44:09] <scott_gonzalez> nice
[11:44:36] <ajpiano> the Foundation section is kind of useless right now
[11:44:42] <ajpiano> you get that all by default from the the theme, etc
[11:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> We should keep it up for a little bit, until we can scour other docs/READMEs for links to the CLA.
[11:45:00] <ajpiano> ok
[11:45:13] <ajpiano> i don't think we ended up with toooooo many cla links getting out there
[11:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, one thing I noticed the other day, which I think is funny is that 47m didn't use abbreviations for anything, except "center-txt"
[11:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> Of all the things you could abbreviate...
[11:45:53] <ajpiano> we should make cla.html in that repo be <script>window.location = "http://contribute.jquery.org/cla";</script>

[12:28:51] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: As long as you have the necessary PHP comment.
[12:29:13] <scott_gonzalez> See jquery/page-contentfull.php for an example.
[12:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Oh, also, grunt-wordpress won't notice if the only thing that changes is the template.
[12:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> So if you've deployed while that wasn't a valid template, then you redeploy, you won't get an error, but it won't set the templat.e
[12:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to make a content change for it to redeploy the page.
[12:30:34] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ping
[12:31:22] <danheberden> intereting - though i've noticed i only get that wordpress-sync error when there is a pageTemplate var present
[12:31:25] <danheberden> *interesting
[12:31:41] <nacin> hello
[12:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> Hey nacin.
[12:31:50] <nacin> I saw that weird bug report
[12:31:56] <nacin> possibly a bug in WP, I'm not really sure
[12:31:58] <scott_gonzalez> So, is that a bug or a feature?
[12:32:01] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:32:19] <nacin> so, it's probably a bug that it saves the post but rejects the template
[12:32:22] <scott_gonzalez> Would be good to know whether I should be patching over it in grunt-wordpress or if it'll be fixed in a future version of WordPress.
[12:32:33] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I would think.
[12:32:42] <nacin> but changing that to reject the post might unnecessarily reject posts that do currently save (just without a template)
[12:37:44] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: if it is a problem you hit fairly regularly, I can toss in a plugin to prevent it
[12:38:19] <nacin> would you rather have it reject the post, or ignore the template?
[12:38:27] <scott_gonzalez> Reject the post.
[12:39:07] <nacin> and this is for an update, create, or either?
[12:40:16] <scott_gonzalez> either
[12:43:53] <nacin> when does a page template not exist?
[12:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> When people don't know to add the required comment in a new template.
[12:45:46] <scott_gonzalez> Which is ~100% of the time that a new template is used.
[12:46:00] <nacin> got it
[12:46:19] <nacin> home.php definitely should not be a page template, fyi
[12:46:25] <nacin> that's a reserved file in the template hierarchy
[12:46:39] <nacin> unless that's the unwitting side effect that works
[12:46:59] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: You probably want to use page-fullwidth.php or something.
[12:47:17] <nacin> or templates/home.php!
[12:47:23] <nacin> (you can do that now)
[12:53:22] <scott_gonzalez> I find the numbers from Darcy and Richard to be funny: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/graphs/contributors
[13:02:24] <ajpiano> hahahaha
[13:02:27] <ajpiano> wattttttt
[13:09:13] <scott_gonzalez> heh, apparently Darcy tried to add all of WordPress to the repo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/ad92b0b1e114f67896ef679471f24f6075930e2e
[13:09:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's nice to know we're passing off that history to everyone's clones.
[13:09:51] <nacin> would have probably made sense to rewrite the history at the time
[13:09:56] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder how quickly rworth noticed.
[13:12:43] <scott_gonzalez> It was four months later.
[13:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, well, four months, but only 2 commits inbetween.
[13:16:16] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: can't we erase those commits?
[13:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> Probably, not sure how that affects the current code.
[13:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> If you know how to do it, I have no objection.
[13:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> That is, if you know how to do it without changing every SHA.

[14:08:57] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano rworth: http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/
[14:09:28] <scott_gonzalez> Took a while, but the index page looks a lot better.
[14:09:46] <scott_gonzalez> And in the process I cleaned up a lot of framework stuff and removed custom code.
[14:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> Also, that page now has three-level deep grids :-)
[14:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> So much nicer when the grid actually works.
[14:11:01] <ajpiano> yeah, exactly
[14:11:11] <ajpiano> now we have grids on all site at the top level if we need
[14:12:18] <ajpiano> remind me what i have to do again to actually make it receive a plugin
[14:12:25] <ajpiano> run the manager script and.......
[14:12:27] <ajpiano> it's been so logn
[14:12:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to eventually get the sidebar using the grid too.
[14:12:38] <scott_gonzalez> oh boy
[14:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> Let's see if I remember.
[14:12:56] <scott_gonzalez> You run the manager script, then find an old gist of mine...
[14:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/2932451
[14:13:38] <scott_gonzalez> Run that in another terminal window while you've got the manager running.
[14:13:40] <ajpiano> hahah yeah, i remember that
[14:13:46] <ajpiano> wait, so what have you been doing locally
[14:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> I have plugins from months ago.
[14:15:37] <ajpiano> wow
[14:15:46] <ajpiano> i have definitely add dropped my database a bajillion times since then
[14:17:19] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[14:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> I don't even remember the last time I dropped my database.
[14:18:20] <ajpiano> oh man
[14:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> I got this laptop on Father's Day and I don't think I've ever dropped the database.
[14:18:30] <ajpiano> this makes me want to go back to arguing in a room about the plugins db schema
[14:18:35] <ajpiano> good times
[14:18:37] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[14:18:44] <ajpiano> the json
[14:18:45] <ajpiano> everything
[14:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> I had an in-person discussion with Ben at one of the conferences about the manifest file, so it's cool, we can take on the world now :-)
[14:19:47] <scott_gonzalez> If anyone says something should change, we can just be like, "BUT BEN SAID!"
[14:24:08] <ajpiano> haha
[14:24:17] <ajpiano> someone said we should just make plugins.jquery.com redirect to his website
[14:24:23] <ajpiano> argh the gistfile isn't working
[14:24:29] <ajpiano> it just not finding the port
[14:25:11] <ajpiano> the site
[14:26:08] <ajpiano> i think im just gonna lie down
[14:26:12] <ajpiano> for a few mins
[14:26:14] <ajpiano> lol
[14:28:17] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[14:28:46] <rworth> it's mathematically impossible to do it without changing shas
[14:28:49] <rworth> this is by design :/
[14:29:06] <rworth> yeah, plugins is looking much better scott_gonzalez 
[14:29:33] <rworth> just got off a call with Pete Mall from Range http://ran.ge/
[14:29:39] <rworth> nacin introduced us
[14:29:55] <rworth> walked him through what we need with Stripe and Amazon integration, with profiles accounts for members
[14:30:09] <rworth> he and a colleague are totally going to hook us up
[14:30:22] <rworth> by Mon he'll have some done, hoping to have it together by Wed so we have a week to test :D
[14:30:42] <rworth> we'll give them a shout out and they'll probably do a blog post about it
[14:30:59] <rworth> and then we've found another potential resource for future work
[14:31:43] <scott_gonzalez> The images on their about page are freaking me out.
[14:32:38] <scott_gonzalez> Every couple of seconds they stretch a pixel or two.
[14:33:02] <nacin> weird.
[14:33:04] <rworth> weird
