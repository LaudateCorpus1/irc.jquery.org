[02:25:29] <bepolite> hello arschmitz 
[02:30:17] <bepolite> I've created an issue for this "jQuery Learning Center - Interactive tutorials for learn and other sites" GSOC IDEA
[02:31:19] <bepolite> https://github.com/jquery/content/issues/10
[02:45:03] <bepolite> agcolom, Do you have a sec?
[02:45:23] <agcolom> bepolite: Hi, yes :-)
[02:45:46] <agcolom> I've added the link from the ideas list.
[02:46:15] <bepolite> Nice
[02:46:30] * bepolite wonder how you figured out that "najela" ==  "bepoliite"
[02:46:40] <agcolom> your profile ;-)
[02:47:00] <agcolom> (your resume)
[02:47:07] <bepolite> REsume???
[02:47:34] <agcolom> from Github -> your website -> your resume (CV)
[02:47:36] <bepolite> Is there anything there relating najela to "bepolite"
[02:48:34] <bepolite> LOL the resume is like 2 years old.
[02:48:34] <agcolom> yes, I'm looking for the link I had.. let me find it again.
[02:48:40] <bepolite> Anyway I would like us to talk about https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/641
[02:49:03] <agcolom> found it... 
[02:49:04] <agcolom> https://mozillians.org/en-US/u/arnold/
[02:49:16] <agcolom> yes
[02:50:24] <bepolite> How will the videos be done?
[02:50:31] <bepolite> Computer animations? 
[02:50:36] <bepolite> Or real videos like in code.org?
[02:50:49] <agcolom> no, I was thinking real videos
[02:52:40] <bepolite> Videos like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1-paxNG4kw
[02:52:52] <bepolite> Its the video for this excercise http://studio.code.org/s/frozen/stage/1/puzzle/1
[02:55:14] <agcolom> yes, this is exactly what I had in mind
[02:55:32] <agcolom> it's very nice!
[02:55:41] <agcolom> did you do this?
[02:57:59] <bepolite> No
[02:58:19] <bepolite> The video or the the tutorial?
[03:00:14] <agcolom> both actually. except the tutorials would be about writing the code (not dealing with blocks)
[03:03:20] <agcolom> the videos would be a nice to have feature, not essential, as would require a lot of work to produce, and you can't simply change a small part if there is a change in the library.
[03:05:11] <agcolom> for existing content, we could just have the possibility to add a tutorial as part of the current content. 
[03:05:40] <agcolom> for example: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[03:07:08] <agcolom> so when we explain about selecting an element by class name, we could have a small paragraph of code and ask the student to select a specific element by typing the corresponding javascript block.
[03:07:41] <sigorilla> agcolom, Hi! Can we use some libraries, such as CodeMirror or jsBin, for this?
[03:07:42] <agcolom> based on the code typed, we could say whether this is correct, or what element they selected...
[03:07:55] <agcolom> jsbin would be good 
[03:08:11] <agcolom> as this is what we're going to be working with for demos.
[03:09:40] <sigorilla> And should user select element from article (ex. <h1>) or from 'html' tab on jsbin (with existing code)?
[03:11:22] <agcolom> Good question! I'd say go with jsbin, because otherwise if anything changes in the articles, because of changes to out jquery-wp-content for example, everything could end up being messed up
[03:11:52] <agcolom> s/to out/to our
[03:14:37] <sigorilla> Oh, yes. You are right!
[03:14:48] <sigorilla> Can we write html code in existing pages with MarkDown? Or should we use node to generate this task to the specific page?
[03:15:22] <agcolom> I'm not sure
[03:16:17] <sigorilla> I tried to paste some <script> and it worked. For example, console.log() and so on.
[03:16:33] <agcolom> in the md file?
[03:16:37] <sigorilla> Yes
[03:17:36] <agcolom> this is probably something that would require investigating into. 
[03:18:28] <agcolom> I'll check as well with the content team to see how this would be best done, and how easy it would be to incorporate jsbin examples
[03:18:59] <agcolom> if not, we could always have separate pages for the tutorials
[03:21:11] <sigorilla> that sounds good. And should we store tasks in DB (sqlite, mysql, etc.) or directly on the page?
[03:24:10] <agcolom> I would imagine a db is better for this. 
[03:59:46] <bepolite> agcolom, Have you ever taken a look at http://www.codecademy.com/learn
[03:59:47] <bepolite> ?
[04:01:23] <bepolite> agcolom, Take a look at this excercise http://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-beginner-en-v6phg/0/1?curriculum_id=50a3fad8c7a770b5fd0007a1 if you may
[04:31:00] <agcolom> bepolite: yes, these are all good examples
[04:32:41] <bepolite> Okay I think I have a good picture of the requirements now
[04:57:00] <arschmitz> agcolom: you still around?
[04:57:12] <agcolom> Hi, just just for 10 mins
[04:57:21] <arschmitz> agcolom: http://jenkins.jquery.com/view/Websites/
[04:57:53] <arschmitz> agcolom: spider results for all the websites it runs nightly or can be run at any time by anyone with a login
[04:57:56] <agcolom> cool! (or not cool ;-) )
[04:58:46] <arschmitz> lol yeah lots of red
[04:59:24] <bepolite> agcolom, If you have the time, please help us with this answers https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/641#issuecomment-82896975
[04:59:46] <agcolom> the 1.3 on api.jquerymobile.com will all be red because the resources are the wrong ones (we have an issue open for that)
[05:00:03] <agcolom> so it's pulling in the 1.4 resources 
[05:00:24] <agcolom> and many of the 1.3 examples were removed
[05:00:27] <agcolom> in 1.4
[05:00:43] <arschmitz> agcolom: we have lots of problems more then just that :-)
[05:00:54] <agcolom> oh yes, 
[05:01:08] <agcolom> but that's brilliant to have
[05:01:14] <arschmitz> i did notice all the 404s on those though
[05:01:50] <agcolom> I'll share with Arthur also. I'll take care of the mobile ones
[05:03:19] <agcolom> I'm looking at http://jenkins.jquery.com/view/Websites/job/stage.brand.jquery.org/1/console
[05:03:56] <agcolom> I'm not sure I understand the errors
[05:04:21] <arschmitz> they are redirects the are going to http://stage.brand.jquery.org/colors but that redirects to http://stage.brand.jquery.org/colors/
[05:04:25] <arschmitz> for example
[05:04:54] <agcolom> so it should go to http://stage.brand.jquery.org/colors/ directly?
[05:05:00] <arschmitz> yes
[05:05:01] <agcolom> (with trailing /)
[05:05:05] <arschmitz> yup
[05:05:11] <agcolom> perfect! I'm with you!
[05:05:16] <arschmitz> that and missing s on https are the most common errors
[05:05:44] <agcolom> right, ok. That's great, because I'm going to have to implement many changes to the org site...
[05:06:05] <arschmitz> well you can make sure you dont have any broken links
[05:06:10] <arschmitz> :-D
[05:06:21] <agcolom> yes, I can fix those as I go along
[05:06:28] <agcolom> ok, great!
[05:06:44] <agcolom> thanks a lot for that. I'm going ot have to go...
[05:07:02] <agcolom> speak later.
[05:07:07] <arschmitz> bye!
[05:07:11] <agcolom> bue!
[05:07:13] <agcolom> bye!
