[09:49:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: k
[09:49:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: did you see that message i passed to nacin
[09:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah. I kinda think we want to just point to codeorigin for those files.
[09:50:10] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise we need to manage purges when jquery-wp-content is updated.
[09:50:18] <gnarf> hrm
[09:50:29] <gnarf> thats potentially a lot of traffic, but ok :)
[09:50:36] <gnarf> lets see how bad it is
[09:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> A lot of traffic?
[09:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> It's only when people view the listings.
[09:50:51] <gnarf> sure
[09:50:59] <gnarf> so
[09:51:05] <gnarf> top menu / sidebar menu
[09:51:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah.
[09:51:12] <gnarf> you got ideas here? kinda the last thing
[09:51:26] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking we should kill the sidebar, use the centered full page format.
[09:51:39] <scott_gonzalez> And then put the project names in the menu bar.
[09:51:45] <gnarf> :+1:
[09:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll make that change.
[09:52:06] <scott_gonzalez> The last thing I have on my list beside that is adding -git listings for each project page.
[09:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> I think /jquery/ is the only one that has it right now.
[09:52:22] <scott_gonzalez> But that should be easy.

[10:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'll check it out in a few minutes.
[10:32:18] <gnarf> ewww
[10:32:26] <gnarf> the TTL was set to like a week on code.
[10:32:55] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[10:43:07] <jdorfman> scott_gonzalez: signed
[10:43:14] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks.
[10:43:40] <jdorfman> can I past the gist on the 404's in this chan?
[10:43:49] <jdorfman> gist url*
[10:43:57] <scott_gonzalez> jdorfman: Can you sign again and actually agree this time? ;-)
[10:44:11] <jdorfman> oh my bad, doing 404 watch for gnarf 
[10:44:42] <jdorfman> done
[10:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> We just started getting a lot of people signing with their email address for the confirmation.
[10:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's because there used to be other fields between email and confirmation.
[10:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> And now that they're back to back auto-fill is seeing it as email confirmation.
[10:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> That's my theory.
[10:45:55] <jdorfman> yeah Chrome filled it out for me, I would just make it a checkbox in google forms
[10:46:07] <jdorfman> ok I will update this gist with 404s
[10:46:08] <jdorfman> https://gist.github.com/jdorfman/02d64a056fdd16cc37c1
[10:46:52] <gnarf> okay /mobile/latest/
[10:46:55] <gnarf> still there to bother me
[10:46:59] * gnarf ponders what to do with that
[10:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> jdorfman: We don't want a checkbox for exactly this reason.
[10:47:20] <jdorfman> ah gotcha
[10:47:22] <scott_gonzalez> This proves that the person actually read at least the part that says they read the whole thing :-P
[10:47:39] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: /ui/images/ui-bg_flat_75_ffffff_40x100.png
[10:47:44] <jdorfman> lol again my apologies I have a tmux session open looking for 404s =P
[10:48:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What about it?
[10:48:16] <gnarf> should that be there?
[10:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> where?
[10:50:18] * jdorfman gist updated
[10:50:21] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I think I'm missing all of the context for this question :-P
[10:50:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: on codeorigin.jquery.com
[10:50:56] <scott_gonzalez> http://codeorigin.jquery.com/ui/images/ui-bg_flat_75_ffffff_40x100.png -> 404
[10:51:18] <gnarf> hrm jdorfman http://codeorigin.jquery.com/ui/1.10.2/jquery-ui.min.js is showing 404

[11:01:04] <jdorfman> brb guys that cool?
[11:02:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I have one last update to do and then I'm done with the CDN changes.
[11:02:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'll tag jquery-wp-content at that point so the footer goes live.
[11:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you want to wait for the CDN to be live before we push the footer.
[11:04:39] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Actually, I'm not sure if I need to make this change.
[11:04:48] <scott_gonzalez> Are we doing aliases for normalized versions?
[11:05:05] <gnarf> meaning?
[11:06:13] <gnarf> i already flipped the DNS
[11:06:19] <gnarf> so its technically "live" already
[11:06:35] <scott_gonzalez> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0a1/jquery.mobile-1.0a1.min.js
[11:06:52] <scott_gonzalez> Would there be an alias from 1.0.0-a1
[11:07:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i don't plan to do that
[11:07:37] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I need to update the mobile listing
[11:07:40] <gnarf> if we have bad numbering it is forever bad numbering
[11:07:47] <scott_gonzalez> Because it's using /mobile/{{version}}/{{filename}} right now
[11:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> And version is normalized.
[11:07:52] <jdorfman> 404s have calmed down
[11:08:10] <gnarf> jdorfman: i think i busted most of them
[11:08:14] <scott_gonzalez> So that's the last thing I need to do.
[11:08:40] <jdorfman> word
[11:10:10] <gnarf> jdorfman: btw - i can't believe someone hasn't requested this report yet - it's by far the most useful thing i have right now to try to solve any missing moved stuff
[11:10:42] <jdorfman> I agree I will put this in trello
[11:12:18] <jdorfman> how does EC/MT do it?  Can I get a SS so I can show our devs
[11:13:45] <gnarf> jdorfman: their reporting is non-existant
[11:13:55] <jdorfman> o
[11:13:58] <gnarf> i couldn't even tell you what files are being requested other than watching my own 404 logs
[11:13:59] <jdorfman> nm then
[11:13:59] <gnarf> :)
[11:14:36] <jdorfman> we are working on a deal with Loggly
[11:14:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://code.origin.jquery.com/ui/images/ui-bg_flat_75_ffffff_40x100.png vs http://codeorigin.jquery.com/ui/images/ui-bg_flat_75_ffffff_40x100.png
[11:15:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Are you copying the images directory for git builds?
[11:15:43] <jdorfman> because a lot of our bigger customers want raw logs and we think Loggly does it the best
[11:16:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: thats a good question
[11:16:27] <gnarf> jdorfman: splunk is pretty awesome too
[11:16:46] <jdorfman> gnarf: $5k a month for 5gigs, not going to fly
[11:16:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it doesn't appear to
[11:17:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We also need to fix the 1-9-git build to not be competing with the -git build for images, but that's a separate issue.
[11:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> One that nobody has complained about yet from the old CDN.
[11:17:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: for now i'm just going to copy the images folder from the old server over
[11:17:31] <gnarf> we should fix that later
[11:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:17:53] <jdorfman> scott_gonzalez: are people complaining about the switch?
[11:18:29] <jdorfman> not seeing anything on twitter
[11:18:36] <gnarf> okay - the /ui/images/ folder should be fixed now
[11:18:58] <gnarf> jdorfman: not that I'm aware of - i think he meant that our own ui -git builds were using the same /images/ folder
[11:19:04] <jdorfman> ah ok
[11:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we have 2 git builds for UI and they use the same path :-/
[11:19:24] * jdorfman heart rate back to norman
[11:19:24] <scott_gonzalez> But nobody has complained about it yet.
[11:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> Luckily they use the exact same images right now.
[11:19:39] <jdorfman> normal*
[11:20:55] <gnarf> jdorfman: mind resetting that 404 report and give me an update in about 20 minutes? :)
[11:21:11] <gnarf> i'm watching my own 404s here too
[11:21:13] <jdorfman> sure thing
[11:21:15] <gnarf> seems stable

[11:37:00] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of purging all cache...
[11:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it's a good idea to let someone go to ?reload and have that happen.
[11:38:28] <jdorfman> I agree, but it has happened and we get blamed
[11:39:03] <jdorfman> gnarf: want me to enable SSL or just wait?
[11:39:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: a) you have to hit that url on codeorigin.jquery.com
[11:40:12] <gnarf> b) we've been doing that for a long time
[11:40:16] <gnarf> jdorfman: i say turn it on
[11:40:20] <jdorfman> k
[11:40:30] <jdorfman> brb 
[11:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: You mean ?reload on the (mt) CDN was a full purge?
[11:40:55] <scott_gonzalez> I thought it was just purging the URL you were on.
[11:41:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no - only one url
[11:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't read the docs, but I'm guessing that on the new CDN we're doing a full purge.
[11:41:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: $result = $api->delete( '/zones/pull.json/' . $zone_id . '/cache', array( 'file' => $file ) ); is all we should ever be doing there
[11:42:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I was reading this wrong.
[11:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> We're grabbing the part before ?reload, not after
[11:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna rip out the part that checks for no file.
[11:42:57] <gnarf> k
[11:43:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: while your at it
[11:43:43] <gnarf> fix 'Done\n' to be "Done\n"

[12:34:39] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do you have 5-10mins (to check this issue with the zip files causing warnings with me)
[12:34:51] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[12:35:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need to test it locally.
[12:35:22] <agcolom> right, if you get jquerymobile.com locally as it currently is...
[12:35:43] <agcolom> (that should be fine). 
[12:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> updatin
[12:36:09] <agcolom> then I added locally 1.3.2 (zip) 
[12:36:23] <agcolom> say go to http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/category/methods/ and get the zip from the bottom...
[12:36:29] <agcolom> link
[12:37:17] <agcolom> for me, adding this to resources/download/ gives a warning when running grunt deploy
[12:37:34] <agcolom> I've also tried with 1.4 alpha
[12:37:41] <agcolom> and other 1.3.*
[12:38:19] <agcolom> could it be that there is something wrong with the zip files?
[12:48:31] <scott_gonzalez> I have a feeling it's related to the size of the zip.

[12:49:38] <jdorfman> new 404 report: https://gist.github.com/jdorfman/b7777b68805cdc0c5b2f
[12:49:41] <agcolom> yes, we discovered these got quite big!
[12:51:17] <agcolom> could it be related to how the zips are built? (just in case that changed...)
[12:52:32] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so.
[12:54:39] <scott_gonzalez> We're getting back a completely empty response from WordPress.
[12:58:28] <gnarf> jdorfman: nice new format
[12:58:29] <gnarf> :)
[13:02:06] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: it's not the number of files... I added jquery-ui-1.10.3.zip and that worked fine
[13:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> No, it's not the number of files.
[13:02:25] <agcolom> but then it's only 2.4M
[13:04:07] <gnarf> random polling: what do you see at http://code.jquery.com/ 
[13:04:10] <jdorfman> yeah sorry forgot about that command
[13:05:24] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: yes, so filesize seems to be the pb then... There must be a way to increase the upper limit?
[13:05:44] <scott_gonzalez> The file size doesn't exceed any limits that I know of.
[13:05:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: how big?
[13:06:12] <agcolom> is it a total of per file?
[13:06:15] <scott_gonzalez> 9 megs
[13:06:25] <agcolom> or per file? (not of)
[13:06:31] <gnarf> hrm, might be pushing it for max file size for php-fpm
[13:06:42] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: No php-fpm locally
[13:06:57] <gnarf> php.ini
[13:06:58] <scott_gonzalez> My PHP post_max_size is 32M
[13:07:12] <gnarf> upload_max_filesize
[13:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> I have the WordPress limit set to 1G for uploads.
[13:07:14] <gnarf> ?
[13:07:32] <scott_gonzalez> upload_max_filesize is also 32M, but it's being transferred via XML-RPC anyway.
[13:07:51] <gnarf> does that do chunking or something?
[13:07:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm getting back a completely empty response from WordPress.
[13:08:05] <agcolom> memory_limit?
[13:08:10] <scott_gonzalez> And if I add an `echo` to the IXR_Server class, it doesn't even reach it.
[13:08:38] <scott_gonzalez> memory_limit is also 32M
[13:10:55] <agcolom> max_input_time ?
[13:11:06] <gnarf> agcolom: scott_gonzalez- what do you see at http://code.jquery.com
[13:11:14] <gnarf> wp-content? or the old crappy site
[13:11:33] <agcolom> the brown site
[13:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: old, even after flushing cache
[13:11:39] <agcolom> old I think
[13:11:51] <scott_gonzalez> dns cache that is
[13:11:51] <gnarf> yeah - this is gonna take a while i think
[13:11:54] <gnarf> damn long ttls
[13:12:09] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: You around?
[13:12:33] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yo
[13:12:37] <nacin> reading scrollback
[13:12:46] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I'll just explain it.
[13:12:57] <gnarf> jdorfman: you should show that report to your boss btw - put that on the site ;)
[13:13:06] <scott_gonzalez> We've got a few files that won't upload via grunt-wordpress.
[13:13:14] <scott_gonzalez> They're large zips, but not massive.
[13:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> The one I'm working with right now is 6.7M
[13:13:52] <scott_gonzalez> Which is about 9.5M of XML-RPC
[13:13:58] <nacin> and you're getting a blank response?
[13:14:05] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:14:11] <nacin> anything in the PHP error logs?
[13:14:58] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...yeah, it's complaining about memory
[13:15:04] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe my settings aren't taking effect.
[13:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> Also, this seems really inefficient at decoding :-P
[13:15:20] <nacin> welcome to PHP!
[13:16:11] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, my config changes aren't being applied.
[13:16:18] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: use ‚àí1 for WP_MEMORY_LIMIT
[13:16:27] <nacin> or use it in MB
[13:16:31] <nacin> (I know, I know)
[13:17:32] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I can set that instead of setting memory_limit in php.ini?
[13:17:51] <nacin> ah, I misread the backlog - thought that is what you were using.
[13:17:59] <nacin> yes, can set that if you're having trouble with php.ini.
[13:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 9431871 bytes)
[13:18:22] <nacin> yeah, that's 32 MB - so I guess you need more than that.
[13:18:40] <nacin> but yes you can set that in wp-config.php in lieu of php.ini
[13:20:43] <scott_gonzalez> didn't work
[13:20:56] <scott_gonzalez> I put it in jquery-wp-content/config.php
[13:21:06] <scott_gonzalez> define( 'WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '128M' );
[13:21:40] <scott_gonzalez> WP_MAX_MEMORY_LIMIT didn't work either
[13:22:15] <nacin> yeah, latter is unrelated.
[13:22:27] <nacin> the server must be limited to 32MB then, I wonder.
[13:31:48] <jdorfman> gnarf: fo show
[13:32:02] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Using ini_set() works.
[13:32:19] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe WP_MEMORY_LIMIT isn't checked when using XML-RPC?
[13:33:05] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: should be. what is ini_get() at the time of defining WP_MEMORY_LIMIT, and before ini_set()?
[13:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> Now it's 64M, before I made a change in my apache config, it would've been 32M.
[13:36:25] <scott_gonzalez> Looking at the code I don't see why this was failing.
[13:38:02] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...now it seems to be working using WP_MEMORY_LIMIT.
[13:38:10] <scott_gonzalez> Maybe I typed MB instead of M before?
[13:38:47] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well, it's working now.
[13:39:35] <agcolom> Is this something I need to change as well?
[13:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. Just pushed a change to jquery-wp-content.

[13:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> Pull that and see if you can upload the zip now.
[13:40:28] <agcolom> brilliant! Thanks! 
[13:43:27] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I get the same error...
[13:43:45] <agcolom> I did a pull on jquery-wp-content
[13:43:55] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[13:44:10] <agcolom> added the 1.4 alpha zip to resources/download
[13:44:20] <agcolom> and ran grunt deploy
[13:45:34] <scott_gonzalez> What's the error in your php log?
[13:45:59] <agcolom> where is that?
[13:46:42] <scott_gonzalez> Depends on your setup.
[13:46:53] <agcolom> you did it :-)
[13:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> I setup PHP on your machine?
[13:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> So you're using MAMP?
[13:47:16] <agcolom> yes
[13:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> Then it's in /Applications/MAMP/logs/
[13:48:02] <agcolom> [30-Jul-2013 22:43:06 Europe/Berlin] PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 9770619 bytes) in /Users/anne-gaellecolom/Projects/wordpress/xmlrpc.php on line 26
[13:49:25] <scott_gonzalez> Line 86 of jquery-wp-content/config.php is: define( 'WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M' ); ?
[13:50:42] <agcolom> yes
[13:50:57] <scott_gonzalez> Change it to: `ini_set( 'memory_limit', '256M' )`
[13:51:20] <agcolom> without the ` ` ?
[13:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:55:06] <agcolom> 1st time round, it complained it didn't expect the if line 89, so I've added a ';' to ini_set( 'memory_limit', '256M' )
[13:55:21] <agcolom> and then I get the error again...
[13:55:36] <agcolom> 30-Jul-2013 22:54:11 Europe/Berlin] PHP Fatal error:  Allowed memory size of 33554432 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 9770619 bytes) in /Users/anne-gaellecolom/Projects/wordpress/xmlrpc.php on line 26
[13:55:58] <agcolom> Do I need to stop and restart MAMP?
[13:56:07] <agcolom> servers
[13:56:38] <agcolom> but actually grunt gives me a different message
[13:56:51] <agcolom> >> Error publishing download/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-alpha.1.zip.
[13:56:52] <agcolom> >> Error: Unexpected end

[13:57:52] <agcolom> however, in php_error.log, it's the same error
[13:59:24] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why that's not working for you.
[14:01:05] <agcolom> so if you download http://jquerymobile.com/resources/download/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-alpha.1.zip and save it to resources/download and run grunt deploy, it works for you?
[14:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[14:02:12] <agcolom> that's crazy!
[14:02:19] <agcolom> What else did you do? 
[14:02:36] <agcolom> Could it be one of the other things that you did that actually solved it?
[14:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[14:03:50] <scott_gonzalez> I undid everything
[14:03:56] <scott_gonzalez> And the only things I changed were memory limits.
[14:04:43] <agcolom> you mentioned php.ini at the time... ?
[14:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> I undid all of my changes.
[14:06:59] <agcolom> well... I have no idea :-(
[14:07:00] <scott_gonzalez> ini_set() overwrites the php.ini settings anyway.
[14:07:33] <agcolom> so I have ini_set( 'memory_limit', '256M' ); line 86
[14:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> If that's not working, I'm not sure what to do.
[14:08:36] <agcolom> you said "Hmm...now it seems to be working using WP_MEMORY_LIMIT."
[14:09:47] <agcolom> do you still have define( 'WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '128M' ); somewhere?
[14:10:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, it's what I committed to jquery-wp-content.
[14:12:06] <agcolom> right, and that is what we changed to ini_set( 'memory_limit', '256M' ); ?
[14:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[14:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> They should do the same thing.
[14:14:16] <agcolom> yes, changed it back to define( 'WP_MEMORY_LIMIT', '256M' ); and just the same error message...
[14:14:47] <agcolom> should I stop and restart the MAMP servers?
[14:15:48] <agcolom> did stop and start... same error
[14:18:30] <jqcommit> [13jquery.com] 15gnarf closed pull request #30: Update SSL note. (06master...06jquery-cdn-note)  02http://git.io/TXeL-A
[14:21:45] <agcolom> I didn't think it'd be such a difficult to solve issue! 
[14:24:43] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: are you still thinking ? (would it be worth asking someone else to try and see whether they get the same pb as me?)
[14:25:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should see if anyone else can get it to work.
[14:26:20] <agcolom> uGoMobi: arschmitz any of you has wordpress installed with a local jquerymobile.com?
[14:27:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sorry, not yet
[14:27:57] <agcolom> uGoMobi: we have a crazy issue... the zips are too big ;-)
[14:29:07] <agcolom> uGoMobi: do you know if arschmitz has that setup?
[14:31:02] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, I'll see if anyone is around tomorrow to try... getting late here... Thanks a lot for you help... and please let me know if you think of something...
[14:32:13] <agcolom> unless RWhitbeck is around?
[14:32:22] <RWhitbeck> hi
[14:32:27] <agcolom> Hi :-)
[14:32:38] <agcolom> could you try something? 
[14:32:44] <RWhitbeck> sure
[14:33:42] <agcolom> could you update your jquery-wp-content?
[14:33:46] <agcolom> please :-)
[14:34:07] <agcolom> (unless you have uncommitted changes)
[14:34:31] <RWhitbeck> master I assume?
[14:34:34] <agcolom> yes
[14:35:22] <RWhitbeck> ok done
[14:35:46] <agcolom> then could you also please update your jquerymobile.com (master) 
[14:36:34] <agcolom> and then, if you download http://jquerymobile.com/resources/download/jquery.mobile-1.4.0-alpha.1.zip and save it to resources/download (under jquerymobile.com)
[14:37:45] <agcolom> once that's all done, do you get an error if you run grunt deploy?

[14:38:48] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ^
[14:39:13] <scott_gonzalez> RWhitbeck: Did you update jquery-wp-content?
[14:39:17] <RWhitbeck> yep
[14:39:51] <RWhitbeck> is the zip corrupt?
[14:39:54] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: the pb is the zip files are too big. 
[14:39:58] <RWhitbeck> probably doesn't matter
[14:40:04] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: That's a totally different error.
[14:40:17] <scott_gonzalez> RWhitbeck has other problems.
[14:40:19] <agcolom> oh, yes
[14:40:28] <agcolom> this is madness!
[14:41:06] <RWhitbeck> define update jquery-wp-content
[14:41:14] <RWhitbeck> I just did git fetch upstream
[14:41:22] <RWhitbeck> git rebase upstream/master
[14:41:34] <RWhitbeck> do I need to do a npm install or anything?
[14:41:48] <scott_gonzalez> no
[14:41:52] <RWhitbeck> ok
[14:43:24] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: I was thinking that because RWhitbeck has a different setup, grunt could give a different error for the same pb
[14:43:44] <RWhitbeck> I have a different setup?
[14:44:04] <agcolom> I don;t know? (are you on a Mac with MAMP?)
[14:44:09] <RWhitbeck> yes
[14:44:13] <scott_gonzalez> That's unrelated anyway.
[14:44:16] <agcolom> oh... 
[14:44:53] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: and if you remove the zip file, do you get no error?
