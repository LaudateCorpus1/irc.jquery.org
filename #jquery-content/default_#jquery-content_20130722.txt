[06:14:54] <ajpiano> ui-dev.jquery.com is completely busted, we should probably take it down
[06:15:06] <ajpiano> e.g. redirect it somewhere else
[06:18:05] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I already pinged people in #jqueryui-dev to verify that nothing is relying on it.
[06:18:17] <ajpiano> cool, guess we saw the same tweet
[06:18:20] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[06:18:36] <scott_gonzalez> I replied and pointed him to the appropriate learn page.
[06:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> Also asked how we came across a ui-dev URL, waiting to hear back on that.
[06:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> s/we/he/
[06:19:51] <ajpiano> yeah, it's not the first time i have seen someone end up there
[06:19:57] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[06:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> It's like when people end up on the Google Code SVN repo when they're looking for UI source code.
[06:20:28] <scott_gonzalez> HOW DID YOU GET THERE?!?!
[06:20:56] <ajpiano> HOW DID YOU GET HERE
[06:21:01] <ajpiano> NOBODY'S SPOSED TO BE HERE
[06:21:07] <ajpiano> I'VE TRIED THAT LOVE THING FOR THE LAST TIME
[06:22:09] <scott_gonzalez> I dealt with the SVN issue by deleting all the files with a commit message of "SVN is dead; use https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui"
[06:27:29] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: DAMNIT https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/161
[06:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> 5 months ago
[06:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> At least I'm consistent. I found that by trying to file an issue and When I typed "Kill" I got the autocomplete suggestion.
[06:30:17] <ajpiano> lol
[06:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'm willing to bet that 5 months ago there was another tweet :-P
[09:28:42] <jaydev> Hi 
[09:29:18] <jaydev> I have created a plugin 
[09:29:20] <jaydev> https://github.com/jaydevonline/jQuery-Nice-File-Input
[09:29:44] <jaydev> I want to add it to jquery plugin site
[09:30:35] <jaydev> please help me in that
[10:00:08] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: scott_gonzalez can you guys put together abstracts for your talks at jq austin
[10:00:34] <ajpiano> we haven't had them for the last few but i feel like it would be good to kind of outline it
[10:00:40] <ajpiano> esp in the case of the ui/mobile one
[10:01:23] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano sounds good -- i was thinking about doing something a bit more technical than a State of jQuery, what do you think?
[10:01:31] <ajpiano> that would be great
[10:01:48] <DaveMethvin> still plenty of memes though, gotta have my memes
[10:02:00] <ajpiano> hah
[10:02:09] <ajpiano> you should do that thing where it's all cosby sweaters
[10:02:22] <DaveMethvin> hmmm
