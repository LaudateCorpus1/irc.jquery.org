[10:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: Yeah
[10:02:26] <scott_gonzalez> It's tagged as satire.
[10:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> He has a few good satirical posts.
[10:02:33] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i'll just change to "jQuery UI Widget Factory-based widgets"
[10:03:06] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: Ah, right. the "satire" tag.

[17:56:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you around
[19:28:33] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm here now.
[19:31:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so - I'm working on something and feeling super super dirty about it
[19:31:23] <gnarf> but i need to get it done like yesteday
[19:33:02] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[19:33:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/compare/build-index?expand=1
[19:33:41] <gnarf> just hoping for a sanity check / perhaps a work on the UI version/page before I get back to it tomorrow
[19:33:52] <gnarf> any revisions welcome
[19:34:00] <gnarf> i'm on the way out myself
[19:34:11] <gnarf> short time to chat tho if you have questions
[19:37:43] <scott_gonzalez> What's this? https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/compare/build-index?expand=1#L5R68
[19:37:53] <scott_gonzalez> Specifically the `(!b[3]) - (!a[3])`
[19:38:18] <gnarf> sorts '' above any truthy string
[19:38:21] <scott_gonzalez> Oh
[19:38:37] <scott_gonzalez> this is crazy :-)
[19:38:40] <gnarf> and ((b[3] < a[3]) - (b[3] > a[3])) sorts min before pack
[19:40:11] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sorry - could add comment / clean it up to more sane if statement :)
[19:41:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: basically makes the order always '' 'min' 'pack'
[19:41:47] <scott_gonzalez> Isn't that a standard sort?
[19:41:47] <gnarf> also - my code style is all over - mozilla style creeping in
[19:41:56] <jqcommit> [13api.qunitjs.com] 15Krinkle opened issue #26: Description for notStrictEqual() incorrect  02http://git.io/bUFB4w
[19:42:29] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i'll write a saner if - do me a favor and comment the line tho so i'll remember
[19:42:30] <gnarf> :)
[19:43:30] <scott_gonzalez> I'll take a closer look in the morning.
[19:43:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: totally works though - just add a codeorigin.jquery.com to your local and what not
[19:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> What time do you think you'll be around?
[19:43:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: hopefully 10am-11am eastern
[19:43:54] <jqcommit> [13api.qunitjs.com] 15Krinkle closed issue #26: Description for notStrictEqual() incorrect  02http://git.io/bUFB4w
[19:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[19:43:55] <gnarf> if not before
[19:44:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i mean - i'd love to make this better - but right now i just want to get it working so the index pages aren't empty, etc
[19:44:33] <gnarf> still need to write ui / color / mobile 
[19:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> I want to clean up the Mobile files too.
[19:44:58] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to just rewrite history, so I'd like to get that done ASAP.
[19:45:08] <scott_gonzalez> We can look at that in the morning as well.
[19:45:33] <gnarf> sure - i wouldn't mind purging some of these removals from the repo
[19:45:45] <gnarf> i've removed a bunch
[19:45:52] <gnarf> the git builds won't exist here for instance
[19:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> Mobile has crazy things, like 2 zips + all demos: https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/tree/master/cdn/mobile/1.3.1
[19:47:55] <gnarf> gonna do something like try_files /var/www/codeorigin.jquery.com/cdn$uri /var/www/codeorigin.jquery.com/jenkins$uri - php
[19:48:33] <gnarf> so the git builds can live beside - not in the repo
[19:48:40] <gnarf> or at least ignored
