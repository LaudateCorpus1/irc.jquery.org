[05:54:07] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: The site looks much better now. But there are 2 things I'd suggest updating.
[05:54:29] <scott_gonzalez> 1) Spacing around location information. It's very tight right now.
[05:54:48] <scott_gonzalez> 2) The logo in the banner is kinda distracting with the arrow.
[05:55:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'd suggest moving it up so the jQuery conference logo fits inside the bar and then clipping the arrow part when it's fixed.
[05:55:55] <ajpiano> dan literally spent 25% of his entire life getting that arrow thing working with scrolling
[05:56:03] <ajpiano> though he did have it a bit smaller
[05:56:14] <ajpiano> but then it was just too small when standing on its own
[05:56:26] <ajpiano> oh i see what you're saying
[05:56:26] <ajpiano> yea
[05:56:44] <ajpiano> hm
[05:56:49] <ajpiano> i'll fix the location spacing first

[06:01:08] <ajpiano> i sort of like the arrow floating over effect, but it's also kind of distracting
[06:01:22] <ajpiano> my suggestion had been to use the banner form of the logo
[06:01:23] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/image/3R3c1n3n392C
[06:01:25] <ajpiano> which we also have
[06:01:47] <ajpiano> once the navbar gets fixed
[06:03:09] <ajpiano> the "real" version of the badge is actually this: http://cl.ly/image/3U1g2U0X1O0e
[06:03:31] <ajpiano> dan flip flopped the date and the jquery conference thing just so it would make sense when it was floating as it scrolled
[06:04:04] <ajpiano> but we both kind of hate the IA of the "flipped" badge anyway

[06:06:50] <ajpiano> however it's probably a higher priority to get some of the food information into the site before sinking even more time into the header
[06:18:39] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks ajpiano, that looks much better.

[07:12:20] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: why no .DS_Store in the .gitignore?
[07:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> Because .DS_Store has nothing to do with the repo.
[07:17:20] <scott_gonzalez> It's an environmental problem for specific users.
[07:17:31] <scott_gonzalez> If we had .DS_Store, then every repo would have about a dozen BS entries.
[07:17:50] <scott_gonzalez> Temp files for various editors, project files for various IDEs, system files for various OSes, etc.
