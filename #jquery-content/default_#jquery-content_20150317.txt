[03:03:25] <sigorilla> Hi! Can mentors (agcolom or arschmitz) of Learning Center for GSoC read my proposal (http://goo.gl/9oDNIy) and discuss it with me?
[03:03:59] <sigorilla> cc: agcolom ^
[03:04:14] <agcolom> hi sigorilla, I'm reading it now.
[03:04:27] <sigorilla> Thank you!
[03:08:07] <sigorilla> agcolom, what is your timezone?
[03:08:26] <agcolom> I'm based in London, so GMT for now
[03:11:06] <agcolom> One way to improve your proposal would be to be much more specific with the technical aspects. The other thing is that you could start with just adding tutorial parts to existing articles. 
[03:11:59] <agcolom> for example, on the "using jQuery core" section.
[03:14:30] <agcolom> Data is also an important aspect of the proposal. How and what data will be stored. 
[03:18:38] <agcolom> So to summarise, I would sat that the current proposal is too vague. You should re-visit with incorporating details of the data that will be stored, how and where it will be stored. The idea also is to see how this could fit with the existing learning centre
[03:21:55] <sigorilla> If I understand correctly, I have a week to complete my proposal. Thank you.
[03:24:53] <agcolom> yes, that's correct. Some good examples can be found at https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/issues/1
[03:25:11] <agcolom> sigorilla: ^
[03:26:59] <sigorilla> thanks
[05:21:26] <devs4v> Hello! I'm Shivam Chaturvedi and I'm interested in contributing to the jQuery learning center project.
[05:21:33] <devs4v> Any mentors online?
[06:28:07] <g31pranjal> hi, i wanted some help on "Tracking Issues" problem 
[06:35:41] <in-arena> mentors, please help me with some issues for the 'issue tracking of jQuery repos' problem for gsoc
[06:53:45] <devs4v> What is the current backend for the learn.jquery.com site?

[09:34:51] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa scott_gonzalez: What is the best way to proceed to get the blogpost that AurelioDeRosa wrote up? 
[09:35:55] <AurelioDeRosa> I'm fine with everything you decide
[09:36:04] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: I think scott_gonzalez created an account for you
[09:36:10] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Well, he has an account.
[09:36:21] <agcolom> Thanks
[09:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> Is there something specific you're wondering about?
[09:36:54] <agcolom> AurelioDeRosa: do you have your account details to put the draft up?
[09:37:13] <AurelioDeRosa> Yes
[09:37:36] <AurelioDeRosa> Do you want me to save the draft on WP?
[09:37:55] <agcolom> Ok, so would it be ok to put the draft up and share preview with us for final check (checking links etc)?
[09:38:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: does that sound ok to you?
[09:38:26] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:38:30] <agcolom> great! Thanks
[09:38:48] <agcolom> So Yes, AurelioDeRosa you can put the draft up and share preview with us for final check (checking links etc)
[09:39:23] <agcolom> I'll be able to check in about 1-2h as will be traveling soon.
[09:42:51] <AurelioDeRosa> Done. The article looks fine and it's now pending for your final review.
[09:43:08] <AurelioDeRosa> I haven't used any tag or category and it seems this is the way you usually work
[11:09:40] <devs4v> Can someone tell me what are the backend technologies that learn.jquery.com is using?
[11:10:28] <devs4v> I am interested in contributing to the jquery learning Center project and would like to know the basic organization before I can propose what I have in mind for the project! Any help would be much appreciated!
[11:23:29] <arthurvr> devs4v: We currently use a highly customized wordpress setup as our backend. We have grunt tasks to handle deploying to wp. You might be interested https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content.
[11:24:15] <arthurvr> devs4v: Tho for the interactive tutorials a nodejs backend is prefered. https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/641 
[11:24:44] <devs4v> Thank you! I also saw that the github base actually contains several .md files whose markup seems to be translated to the final pages that wordpress renders.
[11:24:47] <devs4v> Is that the case?
[11:25:43] <arthurvr> devs4v: Yes it is! Awesome, isnâ€™t it?
[11:25:47] <devs4v> @arthurvr I was guessing that setting up the interactive tutorials be done with a combination of a Django site and a PostgreSQL database.
[11:26:18] <devs4v> Though Django is slow and nodejs is seriously fast enough to handle the kind of interaction that such tutorials will require
[11:27:04] <devs4v> I have a few ideas in mind about the interactive tutorials that the site can use. What could be the best possible way to put it up for review?
[11:27:28] <devs4v> And I agree that .md to render workflow is seriously supercool! :D
[11:28:51] <arthurvr> devs4v: Also itâ€™s good if all our tooling is writtin in node, you know. All our existing tooling is node/php.
[11:30:46] <arthurvr> devs4v: If you want more eyes on your ideas you can always throw them in the issue I linked up.
[11:32:22] <devs4v> That would be great! Is it issue #641? If not, can you please hook me up with the link to the issue?
[11:32:33] <arthurvr> It is!
[11:33:32] <devs4v> Nice! Thanks a lot! By the way, I hope this isn't inappropriate, but are you the mentor for this project?
[11:34:48] <arthurvr> devs4v: Iâ€™m not, agcolom is.
[11:35:07] <arthurvr> devs4v: Tho Iâ€™m a content team member, so if you have more questions, feel free.
[11:36:19] <devs4v> Yeah, I was just wondering whether this interactive tutorial site would be a part of learn.jquery.com or completely a different entity?
[11:37:10] <devs4v> Plus, I guess for now it will contain some content like videos from the "admins" which might be the contributors associated with jquery. Am I correct with this understanding?
[11:38:28] <sigorilla> arthurvr, should Node listen server or only render a tasks to a page as grunt? And should there be a form for tasks in the WP admin? (also about tutorials)
[11:40:04] <arthurvr> Well, I guess it will plugin into learn.jquery.com, yeah.
[11:40:52] <arthurvr> We never use wp-admin (or really rarely). We want everything to be open source (living on github). You might be interested in watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t61RoAs7E8. It covers many interesting stuff regarding our infrastructure.
[11:42:47] <sigorilla> Oh, thanks!
[11:43:21] <devs4v> @arthurvr Alright! But then how do you plan to integrate the wp based portion with the nodejs portion. I'm kinda curious to find that out before I delve into the specifics of my proposal for the learning center site.
[11:44:12] <arthurvr> devs4v: All to be figured out, I guess :D
[11:45:01] <devs4v> part of the proposal perhaps? Though I don't have much clue how that could be done. Would be a nice idea to be discussed, though!
