[10:04:34] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ping
[10:04:45] <nacin> hey
[10:04:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'm trying to track down an issue with stage.jquery.com
[10:05:20] <scott_gonzalez> When uploading resources via grunt-wordpress, I'm getting:
[10:05:21] <scott_gonzalez> Error: XML-RPC fault: Unable to create directory emplate/uploads/2013/12. Is its parent directory writable by the server?
[10:05:50] <scott_gonzalez> I've traced this to wp_upload_dir(), but I'm not sure the easiest way to see the options that are getting used.
[10:05:56] <scott_gonzalez> Anything better than just looking at the database?
[10:19:17] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like the upload_path is set.
[10:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ^
[10:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> Should I just update the db value or is there a proper way to change this?
[10:30:06] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like blogs.dir/1/ doesn't exist anyway.
[10:30:13] <scott_gonzalez> Is this because it's the first site?
[11:14:34] <gnarf> nacin: do you have a new ssh key for me to turn on for you? :)
[11:15:01] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: sorry, back.
[11:15:29] <nacin> that's a weird error, what is "emplate"?
[11:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: no idea
[11:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know how that got into the database.
[11:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> I changed it to "wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files" but that didn't help anyway.
[11:16:56] <nacin> you should be able to just empty it
[11:17:08] <nacin> I don't remember how this stuff worked
[11:21:47] <gnarf> it should go to the gw-resources/
[11:21:49] <gnarf> right?
[11:22:04] <gnarf> nacin: can you test ssh nacin@jq01.stage.jquery.com
[11:22:12] <gnarf> your sudo password should remain unchanged
[11:24:46] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: this is gw_add_resource(), I thikn
[11:24:50] <nacin> gnarf: works, thx
[11:25:29] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Yeah, it starts there, goes to wp_upload_bits(), which goes to wp_upload_dir(), which reads the option, then dies.
[11:25:45] <nacin> if you empty the option, what happens?
[11:25:55] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try.
[11:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> Error: XML-RPC fault: Unable to create directory uploads/2013/12. Is its parent directory writable by the server?
[11:27:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez try again?
[11:28:28] <scott_gonzalez> same
[11:28:30] <gnarf> this is strange because blogs.dir is group writable by www-data
[11:28:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez and again?
[11:29:14] <scott_gonzalez> worked that time
[11:29:30] <gnarf> `cd jquery-wp-content; mkdir uploads ; chgrp www-data uploads; chown g+w uploads`
[11:29:41] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to try to deploy to production and see what happens.
[11:29:44] <gnarf> seems blogs.dir should have worked tho
[11:30:32] <gnarf> thats already there
[11:30:36] <gnarf> and seems to be the "default"
[11:31:10] <gnarf> also the group/owner bits on blogs.dir are ensured in puppet
[11:31:31] <gnarf> i think it should be set to blogs.dir -- not "uploads"
[11:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> All of the other sites have an explicit "wp-content/blogs.dir/<site-id>/files"
[11:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> I tried that for this one (using 1 for the site id), but it failed.
[11:36:53] <scott_gonzalez> Logging into production to check what's set.
[11:38:05] <scott_gonzalez> It's set to "emplate/uploads" on production as well.
[11:38:09] <gnarf> it seems it should just be "blogs.dir/<id>/files"
[11:38:18] <gnarf> because its jquery-wp-content/blogs.dir
[11:38:25] <gnarf> and when you made it just "uploads"
[11:38:33] <gnarf> it was "jquery-wp-content/uploads"
[11:39:05] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I don't understand why it would be different from the other sites.
[11:39:11] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know how the emplate value got there.
[11:39:21] <scott_gonzalez> And I don't know why wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files doesn't work if it works for the other sites.
[11:39:29] <gnarf> me neither - cc nacin?
[11:39:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: is it working for the other sites though?
[11:39:58] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, lots of sites use resources.
[11:40:01] <nacin> the first site doesn't use wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files - it uses wp-content/uploads
[11:40:06] <scott_gonzalez> But jquery.com never used them before.
[11:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> I just added the first one.
[11:40:16] <nacin> but I am not sure if that's how we actually configured jquery.com
[11:40:36] <gnarf> wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files should work then
[11:40:53] <gnarf> im just not sure how wp-content gets turned into jquery-wp-content though
[11:41:06] <gnarf> it seems that the value should actually be blogs.dir/1/files/

[12:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Failed to deploy because of permissions.
[12:49:53] <scott_gonzalez> Error: XML-RPC fault: Unable to create directory uploads/2013/12. Is its parent directory writable by the server?
[12:50:02] <scott_gonzalez> production
[12:50:16] <gnarf> that should be blogs.dir/1 yeah?
[12:50:31] <scott_gonzalez> I can make it be that if you want.
[12:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> I just made it match stage.
[12:51:27] <gnarf> try blogs.dir/1/files
[12:52:14] <scott_gonzalez> Error: XML-RPC fault: Unable to create directory blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12. Is its parent directory writable by the server?
[12:56:57] <gnarf> wtf
[12:59:22] <gnarf> i made the directory‚Ä¶ seems that it should automatically create that directory....
[12:59:49] <gnarf> what is it set to on another site?
[13:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> wp-content/blogs.dir/<site-id>/files
[13:00:12] <scott_gonzalez> For every site other than jquery.com
[13:00:15] <gnarf> okay i guess it needs the wp-content
[13:00:20] <gnarf> okay i guess it needs the wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files
[13:00:43] <scott_gonzalez> Error: XML-RPC fault: Unable to create directory wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2013/12. Is its parent directory writable by the server?
[13:00:58] <gnarf> what the actual fuck
[13:01:03] <gnarf> cc nacin - i don't get this
[13:01:20] <scott_gonzalez> me neither
[13:01:35] <nacin> how can I best trigger this?
[13:01:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: does this work on a local install?
[13:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:01:53] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: SSH to jq02
[13:02:04] <scott_gonzalez> cd /usr/local/wordpress-repos/jquery.com
[13:02:11] <scott_gonzalez> sudo -u jqdeploy grunt deploy
[13:02:35] <nacin> jq02.jquery.com?
[13:02:46] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:02:47] <nacin> permission denied public key.
[13:02:57] <scott_gonzalez> You're still broken, huh?
[13:02:58] <gnarf> forcing puppet update
[13:03:00] <gnarf> 1 sec
[13:03:25] <gnarf> or wait
[13:03:28] <gnarf> you aren't on jq02 yet
[13:03:29] <gnarf> fixing
[13:03:58] <nacin> is this a stage box? anything live?
[13:04:16] <scott_gonzalez> It's production.
[13:04:34] <nacin> ok, so you're debugging this on prod?
[13:04:45] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf can undo whatever permissions he changed on stage and we can work there.
[13:04:53] <nacin> would be nicer.
[13:04:58] <scott_gonzalez> That's where I was having the problem earlier.
[13:05:08] <gnarf> i'll do that on stage
[13:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: So, same steps, just use jq02.stage.jquery.com.
[13:05:42] <gnarf> done
[13:06:41] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I need to remove the resource first.
[13:06:46] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise it won't try to do the upload.
[13:06:59] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do that on stage now and then make sure we're getting the same error.
[13:07:23] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: nacin: jq02.stage.jquery.com should have a nacin now
[13:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ok, it's reproducible now.
[13:08:43] <scott_gonzalez> And the upload_path is empty on that server, so it's using the default of "uploads"
[13:09:31] <gnarf> nacin: the repo being deployed is on jq02.stage.jquery.com /usr/local/wordpress-repos/jquery.com - the server deployed to is jq01.stage.jquery.com /var/www/wordpress
[13:10:02] <gnarf> it >should< use jq01.stage.jquery.com:/var/www/wordpress/blogs.dir/1/ imo
[13:10:11] <gnarf> because blogs.dir is ensured writable by www-data
[13:11:07] <nacin> not having luck ssh'ing into that box
[13:12:11] <nacin> spinning wheel when attempted
[13:17:42] <gnarf> um
[13:17:45] <gnarf> maybe you got banned
[13:18:04] <gnarf> doesn't seem so
[13:18:13] <gnarf> you can't ssh nacin@jq02.stage.jquery.com ?
[13:18:28] <nacin> works now
[13:18:30] <gnarf> k
[13:18:58] <nacin> `grunt` I imagine?
[13:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> grunt deploy
[13:25:47] <gnarf> sudo -u jqdeploy grunt deploy
[13:25:53] <gnarf> nacin ^
[13:30:38] <nacin> I am going to start debugging on jq01
[13:30:39] <nacin> .stage
[13:41:10] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: why doesn't jquery-wp-content/uploads exist?
[13:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> I dunno. Because we never needed it before?
[13:42:00] <gnarf> because everything seemed to use blogs.dir/
[13:42:22] <gnarf> because we didn't use the site #1 for upload resources
[13:43:11] <gnarf> it seems to me that it >should< be using blogs.dir/1/
[13:43:30] <gnarf> the blogs.dir folder is ensured writable by www-data
[14:12:54] <nacin> so basically, WP doesn't use blogs.dir/1, it uses wp-content/uploads. that's because a default WP install uses wp-content/uploads. Then when it becomes a multisite network, blogs.dir is used for sites 2+. However, in 3.5, we ditched blogs.dir for new networks. Now everything is in wp-content/uploads. sites 2+ are in wp-content/uploads/sites/*
[14:13:11] <nacin> we could filter it for now for site 1 to use blogs.dir/1
[14:13:14] <nacin> that's not a big deal
[14:16:55] <gnarf> nacin: seems like the "right" fix for us
[14:16:59] <gnarf> since we have been using blogs.dir
[14:17:47] <gnarf> also note: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content blogs.dir exists in the main install
[14:17:52] <gnarf> but no uploads/
[14:17:55] <nacin> you guys adopted multisite right around a time where we tried to excise a lot of the crap (like ms-files.php and blogs.dir)
[14:18:33] <gnarf> i actually think we could probably switch to using uploads/
[14:18:47] <gnarf> i don't think any uploads actually stick around in those folders
[14:18:51] <nacin> right
[14:18:54] <gnarf> just temp spots til they move to gw-resources
[14:18:57] <nacin> they get uploaded then moved elsewhere
[14:19:07] <gnarf> so either way....
[14:19:16] <gnarf> I can ensure the uploads/ folder exists if thats what we want to do
[14:19:55] <gnarf> as long as we can then also remove blogs.dir
[14:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I can just commit an uploads directory to jquery-wp-content.
[14:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Anything we should change to get inline with newer versions of WordPress, feel free to just file issues on jquery-wp-content.
[14:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> We'll eventually make the changes.
[14:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> Speaking of making changes...
[14:23:58] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/175#issuecomment-29179697
[14:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: How bad is removing `wp_head()`?
