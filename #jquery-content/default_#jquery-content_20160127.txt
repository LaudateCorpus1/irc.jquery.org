[15:27:27] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi everyone. Sorry for today, I wasn't able to make our meeting because of issues at work.
[15:27:38] <AurelioDeRosa> I wasn't even able to inform you about that.
[15:28:15] <AurelioDeRosa> We got clients in tomorrow morning and we had to complete a few tasks before the meeting.
[15:31:30] <AurelioDeRosa> If you have a few spare minutes, there are some easy PRs I made. If you don't have any change we can merge them.
