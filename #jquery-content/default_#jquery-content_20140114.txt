[08:06:00] <gnarf> tj_vantoll1 ping
[08:06:12] <gnarf> i don't think that does what you want it to do
[08:06:26] <tj_vantoll1> What do you mean?
[08:06:47] <gnarf> it makes the breaks happen in the middle of words
[08:07:01] <gnarf> i.e. `false` can become  `fa\nlse`
[08:07:04] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/1u1Z1u2P2z2s
[08:07:25] <gnarf> http://cl.ly/image/1q3i1u0b0r03
[08:07:29] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah but that's the only way to prevent it from leaving its container.
[08:09:01] <gnarf> removing whitespace pre ? 
[08:10:46] <gnarf> the blocks where pre whitespace matters should be ``` blocks
[08:11:00] <gnarf> so those should be <pre><code>'s
[08:12:20] <tj_vantoll1> No setting for white-space on long <code> tags will keep them from escaping their container.
[08:14:03] <gnarf> tj_vantoll1: just to make sure i read that right, you're saying "remove white-space: pre;" instead of "break-words" == expected behavior
[08:16:16] <tj_vantoll1> I'm saying you can't keep <code>https://github.com/YourUsername/contribute.jquery.org.git</code> from leaving its container on small screens without using word-wrap: break-word. Unless I'm unaware of something.
[08:18:05] <tj_vantoll1> I agree though what I just committed is problematic though.
[08:18:25] <tj_vantoll1> Wow that was a horrible sentence.
[08:18:47] <gnarf> does combining break word with no pre make it wrap sensibly?
[08:19:26] <gnarf> for blocks with really long words and no spaces i suppose that is still a problem though
[08:22:45] <jqcommit> [13jquery-wp-content] 15AurelioDeRosa opened issue #274: Avatar overflows container 02http://git.io/sDydHw
[08:22:53] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah the URLs in <code> blocks are what kills this.
[08:23:08] <gnarf> tj_vantoll1: http://jsbin.com/EQIXuYeb/1/edit?html,css,output
[08:23:58] <gnarf> if we use pre-wrap even on <code> it seems to have sane breaks unless it needs to break-word
[08:24:56] <tj_vantoll1> iirc that broke <pre><code>, but we could always add on pre code { white-space: pre; }
[08:25:21] <gnarf> you still want pre-wrap tho right?
[08:25:26] <gnarf> oh no
[08:25:30] <gnarf> because we add scroll
[08:25:31] <gnarf> yeah
[08:26:48] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah I think this will work. code { white-space: pre-wrap; } and pre code { white-space: pre; }. I'm testing that out now.
[08:27:14] <gnarf> tj_vantoll1: http://jsbin.com/EQIXuYeb/2/edit?html,css,output
[08:27:51] <gnarf> i think you still need break-word and switch back to normal inside the <pre>
[08:28:16] <tj_vantoll1> Yeah I left break-word.
[08:28:38] <gnarf> i think pre code needs word-wrap: normal;
[08:28:54] <tj_vantoll1> Well, it's kind of irrelevant because of the scrolling.
[08:29:08] <gnarf> when i remove it from my jsbin
[08:29:15] <gnarf> it breaks instead of scrolls
[08:31:44] <gnarf> tj_vantoll: http://jsbin.com/EQIXuYeb/3/edit
[08:32:12] <tj_vantoll> I hate Comcast.
[08:32:18] <tj_vantoll> gnarf: ok

[08:34:39] <tj_vantoll> <code> blocks still wrap, but now they never break up worlds.

[08:43:42] <gnarf> um
[08:44:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: are blog.jquery.com and blog.jquerymobile.com using wp-content now?
[08:44:31] <scott_gonzalez> kinda
[08:44:43] <scott_gonzalez> They use http://github.com/jquery/blog.jquery.com-theme
[08:44:53] <scott_gonzalez> Which is mostly a copy of jquery-wp-content.
[08:45:09] <gnarf> so why close blog.jquery.com-theme#1 ?
[08:45:15] <gnarf> you'll need to port the fix right?
[08:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> Because I don't want duplicate tickets.
[08:45:39] <gnarf> fair
[08:45:56] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't have closed it if we didn't get the duplicate.
[08:46:12] <scott_gonzalez> But as long as we have the duplicate, we might as well track it in the "real" repo.
[08:46:17] <gnarf> sure
[08:46:44] <scott_gonzalez> Though, honestly, the fix would go straight into blog.jquery.com-theme if we keep using the current setup.
[08:46:58] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/blog.jquery.com-theme/blob/master/jquery/css/blog.css is the only file that really gets modified in that repo.
[08:47:02] <scott_gonzalez> Everything else is just copied over.
[08:47:12] <gnarf> sure
[08:47:18] <scott_gonzalez> But we can move that over to jquery-wp-content. It'd make the update process less error pront.
[08:47:21] <scott_gonzalez> *prone.
[08:47:39] <scott_gonzalez> Right now, I have to put this line back in for every update: https://github.com/jquery/blog.jquery.com-theme/blob/master/jquery/css/base.css#L11
[08:50:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf tj_vantoll: Good work on that. Just update the commit message and land.
[08:51:22] <tj_vantoll> Could I note that it fixes the original issue?
[08:51:36] <tj_vantoll> Ah I see your comment now.
[08:51:38] <tj_vantoll> nm
[08:54:24] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, you can use Fixes instead of Ref for the ticket.
