[09:07:28] <dybowski> I'm getting the error "Error: spawn ENOENT" when doing step 8 of http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/#workflow.  I have `xmllint` and `xsltproc` in my Windows system path.  I have the jquery-wp-content and wordpress running correctly.  all steps up to 8 worked fine.  Can anyone point me to a solution besides runing linux?
[09:11:52] <scott_gonzalez> dybowski: I don't have a Windows machine hooked up right now to test on, but I can try to debug it with you.
[09:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> First, let's see if node can see those executables.
[09:14:13] <dybowski> that would be great - here is the error message: C:\Users\dennis\Documents\GitHub\api.jquery.com [master +1 ~0 -0 !]> grunt deplo y Running "check-modules" task  events.js:72         throw er; // Unhandled 'error' event               ^ Error: spawn ENOENT     at errnoException (child_process.js:980:11)     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (child_process.js:771:34)
[09:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, it's failing during check-modules?
[09:14:52] <dybowski> correct
[09:15:05] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[09:15:36] <scott_gonzalez> What happens when you run `npm ls` ?
[09:17:08] <dybowski> I get a pretty extensive module tree
[09:17:46] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's the only thing check-modules does.
[09:17:48] <dybowski> â”€â”¬ grunt@0.3.17  â”œâ”€â”€ async@0.1.22  â”œâ”€â”€ colors@0.6.2  â”œâ”€â”¬ connect@2.4.6  â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ bytes@0.1.0  â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ cookie@0.0.4  â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ crc@0.2.0  â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ debug@0.7.2  â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ formidable@1.0.11  â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ fresh@0.1.0  â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ pause@0.0.1  â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ qs@0.5.1  â”‚ â””â”€â”¬ send@0.0.4  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mime@1.2.6  â”‚   â””â”€â”€ range-parser@0.0.4  â”œâ”€â”€ dateformat@1.0.
[09:17:58] <dybowski> etc.   
[09:19:07] <dybowski> so something's missing - probably the two windows utilities are not being found :(
[09:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> No, the output would be different if that was the problem.
[09:20:25] <scott_gonzalez> If you really want to be sure, you can edit ./node_modules/grunt-check-modules/tasks/check-modules.js
[09:20:33] <scott_gonzalez> Just throw in some console.log()s.
[09:21:14] <scott_gonzalez> But if it had gotten past check-modules, then you'd see `Running "clean" task` before the error
[09:23:08] <dybowski> ah - excellent - I'll start there.  thanks for your help.  I was hoping to get away with not grunting to much, but it's never that easy.  thanks again
[09:24:11] <scott_gonzalez> Let me know if you figure it out (or even if you don't figure it out).
[09:24:52] <dybowski> I will do that
