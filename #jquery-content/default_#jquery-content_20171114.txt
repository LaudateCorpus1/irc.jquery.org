[14:40:02] <ngokli> I noticed that the html in the last demo does not match the code in the corresponding example on this page: https://api.jquery.com/val/
[14:41:24] <ngokli> I'm not sure where to find that on github (and also whether I can really spend work time to submit it)
[14:42:06] <ngokli> The discrepancy I noticed is that both checkboxes and both radio buttons have value="check'1"
[14:42:18] <ngokli> value="check1"
[14:43:21] <ngokli> I'm sorry, I am absolutely wrong!
[14:44:01] <ngokli> I inadvertently modified those values while playing around with the val() method in jquery...
[14:44:03] <ngokli> Sorry and thanks.
[14:44:32] <kswedberg> ngokli: no problem. If you do spot errors, though, feel free to report them at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues
[14:44:50] <ngokli> I will keep that in mind!
[14:45:53] <ngokli> And thanks for the friendliness!
