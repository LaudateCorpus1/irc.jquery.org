[03:12:37] <agcolom> aluka: I'd say you'd want to optimise the screen size to the tasks at hand. So if you're watching a lesson (wither text or video), the most of the screen should be dedicated to that.
[03:13:43] <agcolom> then, when doing the tutorial, again, the screen should be dedicated to the tutorial itself, with the instructions area for only the current task and the area for the student to type the required code. 
[03:14:29] <agcolom> also, no need for seach for topics, as there is already a search on the learn site
[03:19:13] <aluka> <agcolom>  should I give less space in window for vedio or pdf slides , and concentrate more on tasks which should be efficent right ? 
[03:20:05] <agcolom> the screen doesn't have to be fixed. 
[03:20:48] <agcolom> so it can be that the same space is used for watching the video/articles and then the instructions when doing a tutorial
[03:21:29] <agcolom> you can have a link for the related lecture when looking at the instructions if the student is having difficulties
[03:21:50] <agcolom> but this could just open the notes in a separate window
[03:36:40] <aluka> so in place of tasks i will provide instructions and implement tasks in other window ?
[03:40:57] <aluka> <agcolom> tabbed activity will suit this , as one tab for seeing lecture , one for performing tasks ! - is it reasonable ?
[04:30:44] <agcolom> aluka: yes, this sounds better
[12:18:31] <aluka> <agcolom> shall  i send for this prototype and write a praposal for this jquery learning center for gsoc ?
