[01:46:25] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: thanks for your work on the blog post draft, much better
[01:47:49] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: so is it still supposed to go out on Thursday?
[01:53:52] <jzaefferer> danheberden: I've pushed another prettydate tag, still not getting published. Really need that log‚Ä¶ I guess Corey will work on it today?

[05:04:46] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: yup, thursday
[05:38:10] <danheberden> j√∂rn github/jzaefferer/jquery-prettydate 1.1.1 prettydate.jquery.json has the following errors: Manifest version (1.1.0) does not match tag (1.1.1).
[05:38:14] <danheberden> i pasted that yesterday
[05:40:34] <danheberden> jzaefferer: can you click the "test hook" button in github?
[05:42:03] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: it'd be nice, i think, if the log had dates
[05:42:35] <danheberden> even if just YYYY-MM-DD 24:12
[05:42:43] <scott_gonzalez>  ok
[05:42:56] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: did you see the validator thingy?
[05:43:00] <danheberden> think that is worth having?
[05:43:09] <scott_gonzalez> sort of
[05:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> I think it needs to use the actual validator though.
[05:43:37] <scott_gonzalez> I also think that copy/paste is easier than file uplaod.
[05:44:00] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: i'd like to add more ways to read the manifest
[05:44:08] <danheberden> was just trying to get SOMETHING up to help us
[05:44:28] <danheberden> the actual validator is inside of the services.js
[05:44:33] <danheberden> instead of, like, a schema
[05:44:43] <jzaefferer> danheberden: just clicked the "Test Hook"; I pushed 1.1.2 today, this time with consistent versions
[05:44:47] <danheberden> i'm working on cleaning it up to use something like npmjs.com/package/schema
[05:45:06] <danheberden> jzaefferer: the only sucky thing is sometimes you'll push that, and we'll wait a minute, and github will STILL not have the tag
[05:45:21] <danheberden> oh, wait, i need to look at the real log
[05:45:30] <danheberden> since the error.log misses some thing
[05:45:31] <danheberden> s
[05:45:47] <jzaefferer> oh hi, its live: http://plugins.jquery.com/prettydate/
[05:46:03] <jzaefferer> and I totally copy&pasted the description from this other plugin..
[05:46:44] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/1b06d35.png
[05:46:57] <danheberden> jzaefferer: 
[05:47:06] <danheberden> oh, well there you go
[05:47:17] <jzaefferer> is the PST?
[05:47:28] <jzaefferer> *is that
[05:47:47] <jzaefferer> as in, it got published just now, after I clicked on Test Hook?
[05:48:09] <jzaefferer> I pushed the tag about 4 hours ago
[05:48:26] <jzaefferer> can you look for that? Was it GitHub claiming that the tag doesn't exist?
[05:51:02] <jzaefferer> danheberden: ^
[05:51:53] <danheberden> jzaefferer: yeah, server time is PST
[05:52:06] <danheberden> because they're in cali 
[05:52:17] <danheberden> they're goin goin back back to cali cali
[06:08:43] <jzaefferer> danheberden: so, is there something with prettydate fours hours ago?
[06:14:08] <danheberden> jzaefferer: i sent you everything in the logs
[06:17:18] <jzaefferer> sent?
[06:17:23] <jzaefferer> you mean that screenshot?
[06:17:27] <danheberden> yes
[06:17:28] <danheberden> sry

[08:35:22] <ajpiano> into the next logo
[08:35:28] <ajpiano> that's why i was just standing outside your meeting :p
[08:35:43] <ajpiano> also events and conferences isn't a logo anymore

[08:37:21] <rworth> ummm, is the spinny of the cross-browser icon supposed to change the background color of the whole page and shift the project icon tiles?
[08:37:33] <rworth> and shift their colors as well?
[08:39:07] <danheberden> ajpiano: ugh but they are in the folder }:|
[08:39:21] <danheberden> rworth: it never did before
[08:39:29] <ajpiano> whoa, that is weird
[08:40:25] <ajpiano> danheberden: yeah, cause we haven't updated the events site yet for jquery-wp-content
[08:40:28] <ajpiano> that's not really a big deal
[08:40:46] <ajpiano> it's just that the sprited images are too close together
[08:40:52] <ajpiano> if you want me to fix it just give me the psd or whatnot
[08:41:52] <ajpiano> i have no idea why the spinny transition on the cross browser
[08:41:59] <ajpiano> is causing the project tiles to jump
[08:44:07] <rworth> it also wasn't shifting the page bg color last night
[08:44:11] <scott_gonzalez> Why is there so much whitespace on the right side of the home page?
[08:44:13] <rworth> I'm sure I would've noticed it
[08:45:05] <ajpiano> rworth: i'm not seeing anything about the page bg shifting
[08:45:09] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: where?
[08:45:14] <ajpiano> oh on the bottom
[08:45:23] <ajpiano> yeah i'm trying to figure that out right now scott_gonzalez
[08:46:37] <rworth> ajpiano now that I look closer, it's the whole page, not just the bg
[08:46:39] <ajpiano> got it
[08:46:54] <rworth> it's like there's a 5% haze that's lifted off it during the transition
[08:47:01] <rworth> some kind of blur
[08:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> Any time you use the GPU, you hose the page.
[08:48:59] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know why people think CSS transitions are so nice.
[08:50:38] <scott_gonzalez> As soon as you start using hardware acceleration, the rendering process changes and you get noticable changes around whatever you're changing.

[08:57:06] <ajpiano> i like the spinny effect, but i could live without it
[08:57:22] <ajpiano> i don't mind the minor distortion around the image,
[08:57:22] <rworth> doesn't seem worth it based on what I'm seeing :/
[08:57:32] <ajpiano> but the jumping of the project tiles sucks

[08:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> I could live with being able to deploy jquery-wp-content ;-)
[08:59:55] <danheberden> ajpiano: maybe i used the wrong image
[09:00:08] <danheberden> because there should def not be overlap
[09:00:20] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i had a feeling that would be rapidly necessary with rxaviers tag there
[09:00:28] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: we are getting pretty close...
[09:01:06] <ajpiano> danheberden: http://cl.ly/image/2Y003d3F3L1R
[09:01:26] <ajpiano> that's me in photoshop having put a black bg on there to just look
[09:01:56] <danheberden> ajpiano: looks like they are touching
[09:02:01] <danheberden> not colliding
[09:03:36] <rworth> can we put a safe 1px margin around each one?
[09:03:40] <ajpiano> i got it
[09:03:58] <ajpiano> w/o modifying the image, the bg position needs to be adjusted -1px more
[09:04:08] <rworth> :)

[09:12:22] <DaveMethvin> didn't change the home page

[09:15:44] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: looks good
[09:15:51] <ajpiano> yeah not sure how to do the download button yet
[09:16:05] <DaveMethvin> it seems like a pain to have that detail on the home page
[09:16:22] <rworth> as far as the migrate plugin?
[09:16:27] <DaveMethvin> i'd rather send them to the download page for min/dev and the actual file size doesn't need to stay there
[09:16:35] <rworth> or just the size etc.
[09:18:14] <DaveMethvin> I think the size doesn't need to be on the home page, it's a hangover from the days when it was a big bragging point
[09:18:24] <rworth> yeah
[09:18:38] <rworth> I think the button could just say download, and link to the download page
[09:18:40] <DaveMethvin> and i'd rather send ppl to the download  page so they can see the discussion about the migrate plugin
[09:18:45] <rworth> exactly
[09:18:48] <DaveMethvin> agreed 
[09:19:12] <ajpiano> i think the download page could afford to be laid out like qunitjs.com, however
[09:19:16] <DaveMethvin> there was just quite a bit of markup around that button and i wasn't clear on what would happen if i removed it :)
[09:19:19] <ajpiano> so much more digestible somehow
[09:19:40] <DaveMethvin> sure we can tweak after we ship
[09:19:54] <rworth> the comp had a pretty good treatment for a top section
[09:20:09] <rworth> and yes, this can wait (but not too long)
[09:20:48] <ajpiano> rworth: yeah, but we don't have a tagline or a codeblock that should really be up there
[09:21:15] <rworth> are you looking at jQuery-Download2.png ?
[09:29:04] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15ajpiano opened issue #232: jQuery() (no arguments) description is ambiguous  02http://git.io/D-GSnQ
[09:30:46] <ajpiano> rworth: oh no, i wasn't
[09:30:48] <ajpiano> now i am
[09:32:36] <ajpiano> that looks good, we'd have to make the page into markdown
[09:32:39] <ajpiano> i mean, not into markdown
[09:40:55] <ajpiano> rworth: DaveMethvin should we save any tweaking on the download page till after launch
[09:41:02] <ajpiano> the "About the code" section on there feels antique, lol
[09:41:19] <DaveMethvin> that doesn't matter imo
[09:41:24] <ajpiano> "The code itself is written rather cleanly in an attempt to self-document"
[09:41:31] <ajpiano> is a setence that can die in a fire at this point
[09:41:31] <ajpiano> lol
[09:41:57] <ajpiano> rworth: are you ok with the who's using jquery as is right now
[09:42:09] <ajpiano> rworth: basically, i feel like we should actually have LOB look at this
[09:42:15] <ajpiano> i just wanted us to get to a stopgap point
[09:42:21] <ajpiano> and i think we're there
[09:42:27] <ajpiano> though i do want to remove the presentations from the footer
[09:42:29] <ajpiano> gonna do that right now
[09:42:39] <DaveMethvin> nobody will read that far down the page if they're really downloding :D
[09:42:50] <rworth> yeah, I don't want this to be how it looks in 6 months (or even 6 weeks) but I think it's fine for launch
[09:42:54] <DaveMethvin> agreed on the footer, it's too heavy
[09:42:59] <rworth> yeah, ax those
[09:43:05] <rworth> do it on all sites, will ya?
[09:43:14] <rworth> we'll pop some trainings in there next week
[09:43:17] <DaveMethvin> remember this really  isn't open source until we actually ship it and people can see the result
[09:43:41] <DaveMethvin> we shouldn't be hoarding these sites, let's release them and let people tell us what's wrong by volunteering to fix it
[09:44:47] <ajpiano> yeah, i'm just gonna axe presentations for now, and we can get the videos or whatever inthere asap
[09:45:20] <ajpiano> rworth: i was asking though specifically if you're ok with the WP and MT being in "Who's using" insetad of us delineating founding members from users
[09:45:41] <ajpiano> i think a designer will be better suited to delineate that in a more thorough pass than us trying to smash it in there right now
[09:45:50] <rworth> yeah, I see that as a fine stopgap
[09:46:00] <rworth> and I'm actually mulling it over a bit
[09:46:33] <rworth> as in, my visceral reaction was "not what we planned" but it achieves what we promised
[09:46:53] <rworth> it recognizes them prominently, but does the same for a couple open source/non-profit orgs
[09:47:07] <rworth> so like, we can change it in the future, but yeah, it's good for launch

[12:14:38] <rworth> do we need to upgrade?
[12:14:39] <ajpiano> aparently we can solve it by just upgrading to the latest font awesome
[12:14:40] <ajpiano> yep
[12:14:58] <rworth> should be straightforward. You want me to?
[12:14:59] <ajpiano> but since windows is kind of a popular operating system
[12:15:09] <ajpiano> we hsould problbaly not have things we know look like crap look like crap

[12:18:29] <ajpiano> ummm
[12:18:35] <ajpiano> danheberden: ^^
[12:19:06] <rworth> ummm, the icon tiles are all linking to jquery ui
[12:20:20] <ajpiano> oops
[12:20:38] <ajpiano> rworth: i suppose we can...
[12:22:11] <danheberden> yeah, i don't want to play the "lets find out what weird css bug is causing problems"
[12:22:19] <ajpiano> yeah
[12:22:42] <ajpiano> i'm tempted to ask -ot if anyone can preternaturally diagnose it quickly, lol
[12:22:47] <danheberden> just sucks that doing something as simple as rotating a element is problematic
[12:22:52] <ajpiano> yeah
[12:23:08] <ajpiano> i've had similar shit every time i've tried to use transitions
[12:23:44] <ajpiano> rworth: gotta tell you though, the discoloration/blur stuff i don't see or it's so subtle that i don't mind
[12:24:02] <rworth> as scott_gonzalez mentioned earlier, it's just kind of inherent in the thing
[12:24:19] <rworth> it's really quite jarring
[12:24:41] <rworth> my mouse glances across that icon and there's a very distinct flash
[12:24:45] <ajpiano> i literally have no idea what you are talking about
[12:24:53] <rworth> I took a video if you want to see
[12:25:13] <rworth> though I'm not sure how to share it with you (17MB)
[12:25:14] <ajpiano> sure
[12:25:36] <ajpiano> want to just do a skype screenshare/google hangout
[12:25:44] <rworth> sure
[12:31:21] <danheberden> rworth: can do you me a favor?
[12:31:30] <danheberden> on the .feature-box-image element
[12:31:34] <danheberden> that is the image that spins
[12:31:34] <rworth> ok
[12:31:44] <danheberden> add `position:relative; z-index:9001`
[12:32:04] <danheberden> it fixes the white line issue, but i don't know if it will fix the colour issue you're having
[12:32:06] <ajpiano> danheberden: to what element
[12:32:13] <danheberden> the .feature-box-image div
[12:32:17] <ajpiano> ok
[12:32:24] <danheberden> that has the bg image of that spinner thing
[12:32:26] <danheberden> it's what rotates
[12:32:41] <rworth> no diff
[12:33:05] <rworth> yeah, fixed the white line issue, didn't change the color shift
[12:34:41] <danheberden> rworth: if you change -webkit-transition: all 0.4s
[12:34:51] <danheberden> to -webkit-transition: -webkit-transform 0.4s
[12:34:55] <danheberden> does that help your colour issue?
[12:36:13] <rworth> have just a couple min, gotta upgrade font awesome
[12:36:24] <rworth> apparently I'm in the minority with this one, so it's fine
[12:44:40] <rworth> ajpiano upgraded but it didn't work
[12:44:50] <ajpiano> rly?
[12:44:55] <rworth> yeah, boxes :(
[12:44:56] <ajpiano> that is bummer
[12:44:59] <ajpiano> BOXES
[12:45:01] <rworth> unfortunately I gotta run for an hour
[12:45:06] <ajpiano> OK...
[12:48:36] <danheberden> i can only run for like 20 minutes
[12:49:07] <danheberden> i guess not smoking pays off

[13:25:48] <ajpiano> then we'll tag web base template
[13:26:28] <scott_gonzalez> done
[13:26:48] <scott_gonzalez> You generally want to tag web base template first.
[13:26:50] <ajpiano> hey now there's a SITE for sore eyes
[13:26:52] <ajpiano> oh ok
[13:26:52] <scott_gonzalez> To get templates live.

[13:36:53] <scott_gonzalez> fixing now
[13:37:17] <gnarf> danheberden: do you have a link to this cert info?
[13:38:04] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...deploying didn't fix the sidebar.
[13:38:07] <ajpiano> hm, jquery.com doesn't seem to be "right" either just yet
[13:38:29] <ajpiano> it seems like jquery-wp-content didn't do the thing it was supposed to
[13:38:35] <scott_gonzalez> The ganner looks different too.
[13:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> s/ganner/banner/
[13:39:00] <scott_gonzalez> Everything is blowing up.
[13:39:50] <ajpiano> it's all check modules, no less
[13:41:58] <ajpiano> guh
[13:43:54] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, just fixed jquery.com
[13:43:55] <ajpiano> is it a wordpress version issue? we're on the same version on stage and live aren't we
[13:44:07] <ajpiano> nice, did you just manually deploy?
[13:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> contribute is quasi-fixed now.
[13:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> The content is there, banner is fixed, still no banner though.
[13:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm going in and forcing everything to master, blowing away node_modules, doing an npm install + grunt deploy.
[13:45:57] <gnarf> he meant still no sidebar
[13:45:58] <gnarf> :)
[13:46:17] <ajpiano> ah, yeah, no sidebar
[13:48:07] <scott_gonzalez> It's the theme.
[13:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, that's what I meant :-)
[13:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> "The active theme is broken. Reverting to the default theme."
[13:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> I just manually activated the theme.
[13:49:45] <scott_gonzalez> We'll probably want nacin to verify that I didn't just piss of sites.php in some way by doing that.
[13:49:57] <scott_gonzalez> But we now have a sidebar.
[13:50:27] <nacin> hallo
[13:50:50] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: brand still needs a manual deploy
[13:50:54] <ajpiano> or whatever dark juju you just did
[13:51:01] <nacin> themes currently are not enforced via sites.php, only on install
[13:51:03] <scott_gonzalez> Everything needs a manual deploy :-/
[13:51:09] <scott_gonzalez> Walking through them in the order they failed.
[13:51:16] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: ok
[13:51:32] <scott_gonzalez> irc.jquery.org is fixed
[13:51:39] <ajpiano> i saw ;)
[13:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> brand is fixed
[13:53:40] <Mottie1> I don't see a link to the blog anymore =(
[13:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, ajpiano I thought it would go in the header, not the sidebar.
[13:55:13] <scott_gonzalez> I know you pinged me about that earlier.
[13:55:20] <ajpiano> yeah, i'm adding it into the header as we speak
[13:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> It's been a hectic day.
[13:55:32] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Wonderful, now I'll need to update the blog theme :-P
[13:55:39] <scott_gonzalez> You know, to link to itself...
[13:55:54] <ajpiano> yeah, tell me about it
[13:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> At least I can test how easy it is to pull in updates now.
[13:56:25] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i'll have this and one other fix
[13:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, just let me know once you've got everything in and I'll pull it into the blog theme.
[14:00:05] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I also noticed the blog needs an updated footer
[14:00:14] <rworth> don't know if that's one of the changes you're waiting on doing
[14:01:34] <scott_gonzalez> It'll pull in the entire base theme.

[14:16:57] <agcolom> Sorry.
[14:16:59] <ajpiano>  no prob agcolom
[14:17:21] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: also if you can figure out the drafts thing :)
[14:17:23] <agcolom> thanks. I'll read the notes to see what I missed
[14:19:05] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I already fixed the drafts issue.
[14:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> Like 2 seconds after we noticed :-)
[14:19:27] <ajpiano> oh, had to refresh a few more times
[14:19:28] <ajpiano> ok
[14:19:31] <ajpiano> bbialb
[14:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[14:25:24] <Mottie1> http://events.jquery.org/2013/UK/ has no style.
[14:26:23] <scott_gonzalez> blog is updated
[14:27:11] <rworth> gnarf is there something screwy with the events. proxy?
[14:27:27] <rworth>  /2013/uk/ should still be web-events
[14:27:58] <gnarf> is web-events the old one?
[14:28:10] <rworth> oh, it's /2013/UK/ vs /2013/uk/
[14:28:47] <rworth> can we force a redirect from /2013/UK/ to /2013/uk/ caus that fixes it
[14:28:54] <gnarf> um
[14:29:06] <Mottie1> the UK is in the top nav
[14:29:12] <Mottie1> just change that?
[14:29:16] <rworth> that too
[14:29:19] <gnarf> yes? but how is this page served, and why is UK finding that?
[14:29:26] <rworth> no clue
[14:29:32] <rworth> I mean
[14:29:42] <rworth>  /2013/uk/ is web-events (the old repo)
[14:29:47] <gnarf> is that a wordpress page?
[14:29:50] <rworth> no
[14:29:50] <gnarf> it is?
[14:30:01] <rworth> web-events is that old php repo
[14:30:04] <gnarf> i don't think i put a redirect in for 2013*
[14:30:19] <gnarf> oh wait
[14:30:26] <gnarf> that whole site is still the old one yes?
[14:30:36] <rworth> should be for now, yes
[14:30:41] <rworth> and actually even Fri
[14:30:49] <rworth> we'll initially launch Portland on web-events
[14:31:06] <rworth> then flip the switch once all events are moved over to the new wordpress repo
[14:31:16] <rworth> I guess that means no redirect needed after all?
[14:31:33] <rworth> this is a change ajpiano and I came up with yesterday
[14:36:20] <gnarf> rewritten
[14:36:26] <gnarf> yall go changing plans :)
[14:36:45] <gnarf> that was actually kinda a pain in the ass ;)

[16:42:07] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Did you want to link to the plugins error log from somewhere?
[16:45:35] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Also, I want to talk to you about the header id generation, and auto-generating sidebar TOCs for pages like /download and the QUnit pages.

[18:07:06] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: alright, i'm about to head back to where im staying from the loft, i'll catch you when i return
[19:23:05] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: hey
[19:32:33] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: header id generation?
[19:32:44] <ajpiano> i really want to implement auto-anchor generation on headers for sure
[19:34:05] <ajpiano> we need to be able to TOC on markdown
[19:35:28] <ajpiano> we should also definitely include successful actions in some sort of log
[19:36:53] <ajpiano> i can't tell if "it's on the site" is enough

[20:08:51] <scott_gonzalez> And deployed...
[20:18:25] <ajpiano> sweet
[20:19:25] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: So, I've already built this whole markdown TOC generation thing...
[20:19:49] <scott_gonzalez> But we'll want some options for the type of TOC that it generates.
[20:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> For example, http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/ and http://qunitjs.com/intro/ have very different styles.
[20:20:27] <scott_gonzalez> I wrote the TOC generator to build the upgrade guide.
[20:20:41] <scott_gonzalez> But I can easily make it generate the QUnit style page, with the sidebar and everything.
[20:21:21] <scott_gonzalez> The goal being that something like the download page wouldn't have any changes to the content, just add another item in the metadata, and have the build process create the sidebar with a TOC, use the grid, etc.
[20:21:34] <scott_gonzalez> Does that seem like a good direction?
[20:22:00] <ajpiano> yeah
[20:22:10] <ajpiano> in some cases i don't even necessarily think you need the TOC
[20:22:19] <ajpiano> but it would be useful in a lot of places
[20:22:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, it's opt-in.
[20:22:31] <scott_gonzalez> See the metadata for https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/blob/master/page/upgrade-guide/1.9.md
[20:22:42] <scott_gonzalez> We can have 3 options.
[20:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> TOC above content, TOC in generated sidebar, just generated IDs
[20:23:21] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, hover over one of the headers in the upgrade guide.
[20:23:21] <ajpiano> http://contribute.jquery.org/markup-conventions/ needs something like it too
[20:23:39] <ajpiano> oh nice works exactly like github
[20:23:45] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[20:24:19] <ajpiano> oh maybe what i meant was that we needed to be able to generate the toc on .html pages
[20:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> So we can do that even for the pages that just have the generated ids.
[20:24:53] <scott_gonzalez> Do we have .html pages that need TOCs?
[20:25:03] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, we can do it, but it'll be a completely separate algorithm.
[20:25:04] <ajpiano> the one i just linked to
[20:26:10] <scott_gonzalez> Can we just make that page markdown? :-)
[20:26:24] <ajpiano> heh
[20:26:24] <scott_gonzalez> (this coming from the guy who has bitched about markdown for years)
[20:26:29] <ajpiano> i don't think so
[20:26:39] <scott_gonzalez> Why not? markdown has full HTML support.
[20:26:47] <ajpiano> not what we've got :p
[20:27:04] <ajpiano> was trying stuff with danheberden yesterday
[20:27:14] <ajpiano> it was seeming not to parse markdown inside of tags
[20:27:33] <scott_gonzalez> Well, yeah, you can't put markdown inside HTML.
[20:27:42] <ajpiano> haha yeah it's funny that you like the markdown stuff now
[20:28:00] <scott_gonzalez> The way HTML support works is if the first thing on the line is an HTML tag, then it's treated as raw HTML.
[20:28:04] <ajpiano> ah
[20:28:24] <ajpiano> i suppose we could make it .md then
[20:28:52] <scott_gonzalez> For that page, do you just want the generated IDs?
[20:28:56] <scott_gonzalez> Or did you want a TOC?
[20:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> On a completely unrelated note, these fucking drywall screws have little shavings and cause super painful splinters.
[20:30:12] <ajpiano> a TOC
[20:30:21] <ajpiano> you gotta get work gloves man
[20:30:32] <ajpiano> if your'e doing a lot of screwing and nailing
[20:30:38] <scott_gonzalez> A normal above-the-content TOC?
[20:30:43] <ajpiano> yup
[20:30:46] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[20:30:50] <ajpiano> it's easy enough to do manually though
[20:31:00] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that's easy, since it's already supported.
[20:31:13] <ajpiano> what do i have to do
[20:31:37] <scott_gonzalez> Convert to markdown and add "toc": true in the metadata.
[20:32:01] <ajpiano> ah, ok
[20:32:14] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...how do you add a class to a header in markdown?
[20:32:17] <scott_gonzalez> <h2 class="block">
[20:33:07] <ajpiano> yup
[20:35:23] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/3b473w3y3v02
[20:36:48] <ajpiano> that was fast
[20:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> I took a shortcut and only converted the headers to markdown :-)
[20:37:43] <scott_gonzalez> Like I said, markdown has full HTML support.
[20:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> I can push that if you're not concerned about the block headers.
[20:42:31] <ajpiano> oh hrmmm
[20:43:12] <ajpiano> i kind of liked them a lot on this page
[20:43:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not seeing anything in the marked module that would let us add this functionality.
[20:43:16] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[20:43:29] <ajpiano> if you added an hr htough
[20:43:31] <ajpiano> i could deal
[20:43:49] <ajpiano> it was in the process of styling this page that i realised the class="block" existed... for obvious reasons
[20:44:52] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i can see it being useful for us to generally just figure out how to do it to html
[20:45:01] <scott_gonzalez> The only thing I can think of is adding something like "blockHeadings": true
[20:45:09] <ajpiano> like, all the old blog posts will be in html
[20:45:22] <ajpiano> would be nice to have the anchors on the h2s there
[20:45:22] <ajpiano> etc
[20:45:26] <scott_gonzalez> But we won't want TOCs inside the old blog posts.
[20:45:32] <ajpiano> no but anchors
[20:45:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure we want to do that inside blog posts.
[20:46:03] <scott_gonzalez> It'll break on archive pages if two posts have the same headers.
[20:46:21] <scott_gonzalez> Which doesn't seem that unlikely.
[20:46:25] <ajpiano> even on future blog posts?
[20:46:31] <ajpiano> written in markdown?
[20:46:41] <scott_gonzalez> I guess nobody would use the anchors on a listing page though.
[20:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> We could use name instead of id so that we wouldn't have invalid markup on the listing pages.
[20:47:15] <ajpiano> yeah, name
[20:47:19] <ajpiano> i don't think we'd be the first people to ever have anchors duplicated because of this
[20:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> So do you just always want name added to headers?
[20:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> Not as an opt-in.
[20:48:11] <ajpiano> i can't see why we wouldn't want it
[20:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[20:48:32] <scott_gonzalez> And the anchor styling too?
[20:48:40] <scott_gonzalez> For discoverability.
[20:48:41] <ajpiano> yeah, i really like that
[20:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[20:48:46] <ajpiano> and it's a familiar paradigm
[20:49:58] <scott_gonzalez> You don't think it'll be weird on pages like http://jqueryui.com/ ?
[20:50:42] <ajpiano> we can make it an opt out
[20:50:46] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[20:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, and .html can be an automatic opt-out :-P
[20:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> That should actually work fine, because you can just rename .html -> .md and change the headers if you need to convert a page.
[20:53:15] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll work on this stuff tomorrow.
[20:53:18] <ajpiano> ok, sweet
[20:54:04] <scott_gonzalez> So, to recap:
[20:54:18] <scott_gonzalez> Automatic name + reveal-on-hover links for all headers.
[20:54:26] <scott_gonzalez> opt-in to TOC above content.
[20:54:32] <scott_gonzalez> opt-in to TOC as sidebar
[20:54:59] <scott_gonzalez> And related: add "blockHeaders": true metadata flag.
[20:56:50] <ajpiano> h3-h6.block don't exist in our stylesheet
[20:57:35] <scott_gonzalez> Will we even use h1.block?
[20:57:37] <ajpiano> but otherwise yeah
[20:57:54] <ajpiano> i doubt it
[20:58:08] <ajpiano> we don't really use h1s in content
[20:58:10] <scott_gonzalez> So blockHeaders will only affect h2
[20:58:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's true.
[20:58:29] <ajpiano> i don't think we need block headers if we just support html
[20:58:37] <ajpiano> for finding the headers
[20:59:09] <scott_gonzalez> It's a completely different process to support HTML though.
[21:00:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'll see how hard it is to find HTML headers from inside markdown.
[21:04:19] <ajpiano> yeah, but it isn't particularly complicated, could just parse the html with cheerio and do a similar replacement
[21:04:28] <ajpiano> it certainly is much not important compared to getting it working for md
[21:13:47] <RWhitbeck> ok the coolest part about the new blog site for jquery‚Ä¶being able to EASILY navigate back through the archive. 
[21:16:02] <RWhitbeck> lol my first blog post on the blog http://blog.jquery.com/2006/07/30/aptana-ide-now-includes-jquery/
[21:18:12] <RWhitbeck> ajpiano when is the content meetings?  1:30PM EST Thursdays?
[21:18:20] <ajpiano> 1pm
[21:18:47] <ajpiano> RWhitbeck: it's crazy that we just didn't have the archive links accessible anyway
[21:18:53] <RWhitbeck> ok i'll be there tomorrow‚Ä¶been working on learn the last few nights 
[21:19:47] <ajpiano> cool
[22:31:07] <gnarf> ajpiano: i think we should add a robot.txt in the themes/$sitename folder
[22:31:09] <gnarf> you agree?
