[01:28:19] <bePolite> hello arschmitz 
[01:28:57] <bePolite> arschmitz,  will it be a nice idea if students can edit their tasks online using jSBin?
[01:39:28] <sigorilla> bePolite, arschmitz is from Maine. It's UTC -5/-4. So I think it's 3 or 4 hour of night now.
[01:39:43] <bePolite> Thanks sigorilla 
[04:53:18] <jqcommit> [13contribute.jquery.org] 15scottgonzalez opened issue #107: Style Guide: Context-changing methods as first method call 02http://git.io/jW8u
[05:07:36] <arschmitz> bePolite: im here now
[05:09:09] <bePolite> arschmitz, I was reading the meeting logs found here http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/default_%23jquery-meeting_20150325.log.html#t10:06:36
[05:09:24] <arschmitz> ok
[05:09:47] <bePolite> There was some talk about having inline JS bin tutorials
[05:09:54] <arschmitz> no
[05:09:55] <bePolite> Or conde samples
[05:10:01] <arschmitz> just code samples
[05:10:22] <arschmitz> tutorials in a jsbin would be hard because you need to verify correctness
[05:11:10] <arschmitz> we hope to start using jsbin in many palaces soon to replace code samples and things like the jquery ui Demos 
[05:12:28] <sigorilla> arschmitz, Hi! How can we add hint? Or is it necessary?
[05:13:02] <g31pranjal> arschmitz: can u please review my Gsoc proposal for Tracking jQuery Issues on GitHub. please suggest if any change or addition is required before finalizing... https://gist.github.com/g31pranjal/3dd8a257372927fb877d
[05:13:33] <sigorilla> * not necessary
[05:13:58] <arschmitz> sigorilla: a hint where and for what?
[05:14:33] <arschmitz> g31pranjal: we will review all proposals that have been submitted when we have time
[05:14:53] <bePolite> arschmitz, When you talk about code samples, Are you talking about things like http://i.imgur.com/OoCIR1e.png
[05:15:07] <arschmitz> yes
[05:15:19] <arschmitz> things that would be good to try and or play with
[05:15:29] <arschmitz> but your are not answering anything or solving anything
[05:15:32] <arschmitz> its just a sample
[05:16:38] <arschmitz> bePolite: or these examples here are being replaced with jsbins as part of a different summer of code project
[05:16:41] <arschmitz> http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[05:17:31] <sigorilla> arschmitz, agcolom wanted to add a hints if the user don't know how to complete task. 
[05:18:23] <g31pranjal> arschmitz: ok. but before i finalize my proposal, I wanted to know about the role teams on different repositories and it is wanted to be implemented ?
[05:18:26] <arschmitz> so the idea is most of the instructions will be in the read me for each task but there is not strict format to these they are basicly just folders with files at least one of which contains tests
[05:18:49] <arschmitz> sigorilla: so you could easily add tips in places it made sense 
[05:20:03] <arschmitz> sigorilla: for example on this one https://cdn.rawgit.com/arthurvr/jquery-tutorials/master/tutorials/novice/selectors/index.html
[05:20:31] <arschmitz> https://github.com/arthurvr/jquery-tutorials/tree/master/tutorials/novice/selectors#getting-started-with-selectors
[05:20:42] <bePolite> arschmitz, So instead of having the code fragment which i showed in the image above, there should be a JSBin editor where the use can make some achanges and see output?
[05:21:27] <arschmitz> in the actual test page you could easily add tooltips or form validation or whaatever to add hints
[05:21:41] <arschmitz> bePolite: no it would stay like it is
[05:21:53] <arschmitz> but there would be a button that would say "try it in jsbin" 
[05:22:00] <arschmitz> and take you to jsbin
[05:22:06] <bePolite> Ahh okay nice
[05:22:40] <arschmitz> we dont want to embed jsbin directly because then it wont work offline for developement and if jsbin is down for any reason it would break our live sites
[05:24:36] <bePolite> arschmitz, When refering the user to JS bin, Do you think it will be a good idea to refer him/her to a bin which is already populated with some code?
[05:26:25] <bePolite> arschmitz, Something like http://jsbin.com/cuqowefojo/1/edit?html,js,output
[05:26:32] <bePolite> If the article was about sliders
[05:26:42] <bePolite> Or should we just refer him to a blank page?
[05:28:31] <arschmitz> bePolite: it will already have whatever the code from the sample is in it
[05:28:47] <arschmitz> bePolite: and it will be a branded jquery.github.com
[05:28:56] <arschmitz> i mean jquery.jsbin.com lol
[05:30:56] <bePolite> That makes sense
[05:46:12] <bePolite> arschmitz, also, should this JSBin links have qunit tests?
[05:47:48] <arschmitz> no
[05:47:57] <arschmitz> bePolite: as i said the jsbins are just samples
[05:49:06] <bePolite> Thanks for the clarifications
