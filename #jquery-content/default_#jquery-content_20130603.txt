[11:26:10] <danheberden> where is the content for http://events.jquery.org/2013/portland/#training ?
[11:26:18] <danheberden> https://github.com/jquery/events.jquery.org/tree/master/pages/2013 looks a bit... lacking
[11:44:48] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: web-events
[11:44:54] <danheberden> ah
[11:45:15] <scott_gonzalez> I believe rworth is going to port all the content at some point.
[11:45:31] <rworth> iyam
[11:45:39] <danheberden> https://github.com/jquery/web-events/blob/master/htdocs/2013/portland/index.html#L970 is my concern
[11:45:42] <rworth> was trying to do it at the end of last week/weekend
[11:45:53] <danheberden> there are 2 hour passes and day passes
[11:45:57] <danheberden> not full trip passes
[11:45:59] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: What about the docs.jquery.com pages?
[11:46:13] <rworth> that's what I meant
[11:47:42] <scott_gonzalez> On an unrelated note, you're down to one week before we get everyone to resign CAAs...
[11:47:51] <rworth> danheberden so people need 3 1-day passes?
[11:48:31] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I know, I was worried the returns would start diminishing, and they have :/
[11:50:45] <danheberden> rworth: yes
[11:51:12] <danheberden> you could get a 7 day pass
[11:51:16] <danheberden> but, that seems possibly wasteful
[11:51:37] <rworth> it's referring to the passes in the previous paragraph
[11:52:06] <danheberden> which is a 2hour pass
[11:52:11] <danheberden> http://trimet.org/fares/index.htm
[11:52:45] <danheberden> rworth: should i just rephrase it?
[11:52:53] <danheberden> i can submit a pr for that change
[11:53:22] <rworth> danheberden rephrase and commit. That would be great, thanks
[11:56:12] <rworth> danheberden just talked to the folks at Travel Portland
[11:56:25] <danheberden> rworth: oh?
[11:56:26] <rworth> these are length of stay passes
[11:56:44] <rworth> made just for our event

[11:59:30] <jqcommit> 13web-events/06master 14c0aff58 15Dan Heberden: update max fare information for travel in portland
[12:00:04] <danheberden> not sure if that needs any work to go live ^
[14:04:57] <rworth> and it's been live since commit. web-events lives on the edge :)
[14:05:08] <rworth> danheberden looks good
[14:05:36] <rworth> (swap the order of those last two messages. it makes more sense)
