[13:52:22] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Did you accidentally retweet someone from @jqcon?
[13:52:47] <ajpiano> argh
[13:52:49] <ajpiano> yup
[13:52:50] <ajpiano> mb
[13:52:53] <ajpiano> unrted etc
[13:52:57] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[13:53:08] <ajpiano> i usually use incognito donno why i didn't
[14:32:17] <agcolom> kswedberg_: scott_gonzalez as part of the api.jquery.com code example review/formatting, I just noticed that the style declarations that appear in the example on http://local.api.jquery.com/context/ are not being used. 
[14:32:40] <agcolom> oops, not local ;-) so here's the correct link: http://api.jquery.com/context/
[14:33:51] <agcolom> would it be ok to remove the span and div style declarations? If ok, I can do that on the cleanup branch...

[15:45:17] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom agcolom_: Yes, delete the styles.
[15:45:47] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok, will do.
[15:46:43] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: body as well?

[15:51:13] <eddiemonge> would anyone like to give me feedback on a talk abstract i am working on?
[15:53:29] <eddiemonge> https://gist.github.com/eddiemonge/825b460f3d5a9299aa42
[16:07:05] <ajpiano> eddiemonge: it's a crazy amount of content to try and cover in a short amount of time
[16:08:23] <ajpiano> and i don't really understand like, what the "why" or throughline of the talk is? is it like, front end dev tooling?
[16:10:26] <eddiemonge> ive practiced it and got it timed at around 45 minutes
[16:10:42] <eddiemonge> a nothing to something approach showing the tools to get to something
[16:10:51] <ajpiano> which conf is it for
[16:11:03] <eddiemonge> basically a walk through of using yeoman and its generators and related friends
[16:11:23] <eddiemonge> im hoping jq austin but its good for other places too
[16:11:33] <ajpiano> i think our talk slots are gonna be more like 30 mins in austin
[16:11:44] <eddiemonge> i can easily substitute angular for something more jqueryish
[16:12:23] <ajpiano> i think that angular and coffeescript are kind of a bridge too far to fit into a relatively short talk
[16:13:15] <eddiemonge> i could drop those, ang and jade and just cover the tools themselves to make it shorter
[16:15:01] <ajpiano> yea
[16:15:07] <ajpiano> but you should def think more about what the story is
[16:15:15] <ajpiano> right now it's like "awesome tools exist, here are some"
[16:18:45] <eddiemonge> yeah thats definitely what the talk started as: here are the tools we are going to be using. it was for a company presentation and now im converting it to a more generalized talk
[16:18:53] <eddiemonge> http://aspera.github.io/noded-grunt-yo/
[16:19:14] <eddiemonge> but thanks for the story tip part. i do need to figure that out a bit more
[20:20:41] <nacin> ajpiano: ping
[20:20:52] <nacin> saw a tweet about issues with sites, how can I help
[20:21:11] <nacin> cc gnarf, etc.
[20:22:45] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: ?
[20:23:45] <nacin> rworth: ?
[20:29:00] <nacin> this month (or by austin) - it's past time to do a proper setup. two load balancers, two or more application servers, two DB servers (one write, one read).
[20:29:48] <nacin> I'll spend some time this month designing a good setup with WP.com's sysadmin.
[22:33:29] <gnarf> nacin: to note, we will have a openstack vm provider by then most likely - could help
