[00:25:53] <agcolom> gnarf: scott_gonzalez ajpiano hello! How do stuff on stage.api.jquerymobile.com get deployed to api.jquerymobile.com? (I added the swipe extensibility last night and it'd be great to redeploy to api.jquerymobile.com as it's listed in the blog post, but I have no idea how that happens... Thank you :-) ) 
[04:53:45] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You have to tag it with a semver.
[04:54:35] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I was trying to figure out why the_date() wasn't returning anything, but I ended up switching to human_time_diff( get_the_time('U'), current_time('timestamp') ) and that was working.
[04:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> Still not sure why the_date() didn't work though.
[06:25:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: What do you want to do for the plugins site?
[06:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> Should we clear out stage and point jquery-ui at stage to that we can test the scripts?
[06:26:04] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sounds like a plan
[06:26:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: what do i need to do to color's manifest?
[06:26:32] <scott_gonzalez> I fixed the manifest task last night.
[06:26:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/commit/1e2d2ac59b3d81a62cdcc052625fd0bfc34c8ebf
[06:26:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'm pretty sure that was my fault.
[06:27:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: is that gonna stop color from being released on the plugins site?
[06:28:06] <scott_gonzalez> The old tags won't get listed.
[06:29:06] <gnarf> i think I might re-tag 2.1.1 after fixing the manifest
[06:29:09] <gnarf> no code changes so
[06:29:12] <gnarf> should be safe right?
[06:29:22] <scott_gonzalez> Are you sure? mikesherov fixed transparency.
[06:29:32] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you tagged 2.1.1 after that.
[06:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> It's not the best thing to do, but you could do it.
[06:30:02] <gnarf> i guess i could release a 2.1.2
[06:30:10] <gnarf> such a pain to do a release tho
[06:30:11] <gnarf> :)
[06:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> We should definitely get the color plugin up for launch.
[06:30:23] <gnarf> i also wanna get my jquery request animation frame up
[06:33:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: while I'm at it
[06:33:41] <gnarf> where do i put the "download" link?
[06:34:22] <scott_gonzalez> top level: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/docs/manifest.md#download
[06:34:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1.10.0-rc.1/ui.accordion.jquery.json#L60
[06:35:05] <scott_gonzalez> But if you're just using GitHub generated zips, that'll happen automatically.
[06:35:36] <gnarf> the github zips don't have any of the pre-processing done
[06:35:46] <gnarf> i was just gonna point it at code
[06:36:08] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[06:37:35] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Did you get a chance to work on the blog post?
[06:37:45] <ajpiano> i haven't yet, i'm gonna like, now
[06:37:54] <ajpiano> just getting settled in
[06:42:26] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: is "download" supposed to go to a zip file, or a js?
[06:42:38] <scott_gonzalez> Whatever you want it to go to.
[06:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> We point it at HTML for UI.
[06:43:05] <scott_gonzalez> Since we want people to go to the download builder.
[06:44:43] <gnarf> so http://code.jquery.com/#color would be fine?
[06:45:01] <gnarf> after the #color gets synced up to the CDN that is
[06:45:13] <gnarf> http://code.origin.jquery.com/#color
[06:46:45] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[06:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I added a web hook for http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/postreceive-hook but it didn't work.
[06:51:01] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm...do we not have anything creating the post-receive page?
[06:59:08] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: ok. Is this complicated? 
[06:59:20] <scott_gonzalez> Is what complicated?
[07:00:04] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/postreceive-hook should proxy to the plugins daemon
[07:00:06] <agcolom> tagging with semver :-) (to deploy api.jquerymobile.com)
[07:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: git tag a.b.c where a.b.c are sane numbers.
[07:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> For the first one, you'll want to do `git tag 1.0.0`
[07:01:44] <agcolom> so we can't deploy too often then ?
[07:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> Then `git push --tags`
[07:01:54] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Why not?
[07:02:02] <scott_gonzalez> You can deploy 100 times a day if you want.
[07:02:24] <scott_gonzalez> You *shouldn't* deploy 100 times a day, but you can.
[07:02:30] <agcolom> ok...
[07:02:41] <agcolom> so I should increment the number each time?
[07:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> Yes.
[07:02:51] <agcolom> ok.
[07:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> Or you can tag with 1.3.0
[07:03:09] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to match the version number to the code version.
[07:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> Look at the tags here: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com
[07:03:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/tags
[07:03:39] <agcolom> ok... I guess 1.3.0 would be when we're 100% ready 
[07:03:48] <scott_gonzalez> We use the version number + a build number.
[07:04:00] <agcolom> http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/postreceive-hook is just a blank page for me :-(
[07:04:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/2.1.2/color.jquery.json
[07:04:37] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it should work, I'll test locally.
[07:04:46] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: It should be a blank page, even if it's working.
[07:05:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Is there a redirect in nginx?
[07:05:08] <agcolom> ok. Is that what's making a funny noise on my computer? 
[07:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> I know I wrote code to make this work a long time ago, but it doesnt' seem to exist anymore.
[07:05:16] <agcolom> (now you think I'm mad!)
[07:05:36] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: No, it's definitely not the cause of any funny noises :-)
[07:06:02] <gnarf> upstream plugins-postreceive {
[07:06:02] <gnarf>   server jq02.stage.jquery.com:8001; 
[07:06:02] <gnarf> }
[07:06:04] <agcolom> ok, I have to investigate! 
[07:06:06] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: 2.1.2 works.
[07:06:21] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...ok
[07:06:31] <gnarf> location /postreceive-hook { proxy_pass http://plugins-postreceive; } 
[07:06:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right, we removed the code because it's a different server.
[07:06:49] <agcolom> ok... just heading to a meeting at my daughter's school... will be back in a few hours... 
[07:07:05] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Are you able to see what happened with the test hook?
[07:07:16] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: thank you! 
[07:07:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: is there any logging inside plugins?
[07:07:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, to syslog.
[07:07:42] <scott_gonzalez> But I didn't see anything in /var/log/messagse
[07:07:57] <gnarf> var/log/syslog
[07:07:58] <gnarf> its there
[07:08:00] <gnarf> color got added
[07:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> Why did it add to WordPress multiple times?
[07:09:37] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: this :  http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/postreceive-hook  was not for me right? (sorry I got confused, I thought it was something I should use for the tagging!)
[07:10:01] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Not for you :-)
[07:10:08] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i dunno...
[07:10:14] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[07:10:24] <gnarf> http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/color/ has it listed like 5 times for 2.1.2 as well
[07:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> There are multiple scripts runing.
[07:10:31] <agcolom> right! Taht makes a lot more sense! Thanks! I understand it now :-) (sorry for the confusion! )
[07:10:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: there is no "demo" link, so the link on this page seems silly too
[07:11:20] <gnarf> im gonna kill off all the plugins procs and restart
[07:12:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll clear out the db again.
[07:12:23] <gnarf> fresh
[07:12:38] <gnarf> so, a "test hook" from github should do this?
[07:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:13:15] <scott_gonzalez> But I don't want to do that for UI again.
[07:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> It kicked off too many other scripts :-P
[07:13:40] <scott_gonzalez> I'll do create a fake one from my local machine.
[07:14:17] <scott_gonzalez> Test color first.
[07:14:23] <scott_gonzalez> If that works, I'll test UI
[07:14:56] <gnarf> Jan 16 07:14:32 jq02 plugins.jquery.com[22449]: Added color v2.1.2 to plugins DB
[07:15:17] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...wordpress-update is slacking.
[07:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> Let's try doing things in order :-P
[07:16:05] * gnarf starts working on jquery-requestAnimationFrame
[07:16:07] <scott_gonzalez> Let's kill all the processes.
[07:16:14] <scott_gonzalez> Then I'll run the grunt tasks.
[07:16:14] <gnarf> oh
[07:16:17] <gnarf> okay
[07:16:18] <gnarf> yeah
[07:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> Then we'll start the processes.
[07:16:37] <gnarf> so um
[07:16:50] <gnarf> it didn't die
[07:17:22] <gnarf> does TERM do something strange?
[07:17:28] <scott_gonzalez> TERM isn't handled yet.
[07:17:37] <gnarf> okay
[07:17:45] <scott_gonzalez> TERM probably kills the manager and orphans the child processes.
[07:17:46] <gnarf> thats apparently the first signal it sends on "stop"
[07:17:52] <gnarf> exactly what happened
[07:17:56] <gnarf> i killed the other procs now
[07:17:59] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[07:18:00] <gnarf> so do what you need to do
[07:18:10] <gnarf> and lets merge that guys PR to handle TERM :)
[07:18:31] <scott_gonzalez> ok, we should be good now
[07:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> Start up the manager.
[07:18:59] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, send a test hook.
[07:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> Still nothing in WordPress :-/
[07:21:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: /etc/init.d/plugins stop / start is what I'm using
[07:21:23] <gnarf> if you merge that guys TERM handler
[07:21:25] <gnarf> stop will work
[07:21:26] <gnarf> :)
[07:21:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm going to merge it.
[07:22:45] <scott_gonzalez> But I'd like to get things working first.
[07:23:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna throw in some debug code on stage.
[07:23:57] <scott_gonzalez> Log as much as I can.
[07:29:43] <gnarf> does this look right: https://github.com/gnarf37/jquery-requestAnimationFrame/blob/master/requestAnimationFrame.jquery.json
[07:32:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, got a ton of debug in there now.
[07:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:32:54] <gnarf> nice: http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/requestAnimationFrame/
[07:32:56] <scott_gonzalez> I can test locally in a minute.
[07:33:06] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, guess I don't need ot.
[07:33:13] <scott_gonzalez> So why did rAF work, but not color?
[07:33:20] <gnarf> i dunno
[07:33:26] <gnarf> ill hit test on color again
[07:33:51] <gnarf> maybe because it had already been added
[07:33:53] <scott_gonzalez> Well, hitting test on color again shouldn't do anything.
[07:34:00] <gnarf> and there was something hiding inside a db?
[07:34:03] <scott_gonzalez> Because the update-server will see that it's already been processed.
[07:34:36] <scott_gonzalez> Let's stop the processes and clear everything out again.
[07:34:40] <gnarf> okay
[07:34:44] <scott_gonzalez> We should get some really verbose logging from wordpress-update now.
[07:35:10] <gnarf> stopped
[07:35:20] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, start it up again.
[07:35:32] <scott_gonzalez> shit
[07:35:35] <scott_gonzalez> typo
[07:35:48] <gnarf> og?
[07:35:52] <gnarf> :)
[07:36:05] <gnarf> killed again
[07:36:25] <gnarf> plugins.jquery.com - the OG
[07:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> ok, start
[07:36:29] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:36:50] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..
[07:37:14] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't think there's any work to do.
[07:37:26] <gnarf> is your "cleaning" of the DB actually cleaning everything?
[07:37:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's supposed to.
[07:39:23] <gnarf> it seems wordpress-update remembers pushing it
[07:39:26] <gnarf> thats why i ask
[07:39:33] <gnarf> it worked the first time through for both plugins
[07:39:45] <gnarf> but now even rAF isn't being 'updated'
[07:41:06] <scott_gonzalez> Which directory are you in when you start the manager?
[07:41:33] <gnarf> i'm not 100% sure
[07:41:45] <gnarf> but it should be able to start from any directory
[07:41:56] <gnarf>  /etc/init.d isn't picky
[07:42:02] <gnarf> afk quick, brewin a pot of coffee
[07:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking that the last-action file is being located differently inside grunt and inside the actual code.
[07:46:24] <gnarf> this last time when i restarted
[07:46:30] <gnarf> i was actually in /var/www/plugins....
[07:46:31] <gnarf> but
[07:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> This is interesting:
[07:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> plugins@jq02:/var/www/plugins.jquery.com$ sqlite plugins.db
[07:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> Unable to open database "plugins.db": file is encrypted or is not a database
[07:48:22] <gnarf> huh
[07:49:59] <scott_gonzalez> But it's obviously able to read and write it inside node.
[07:50:56] <gnarf> is the version of sqlite inside node different from the console version?
[07:51:35] <gnarf> yeah
[07:51:41] <gnarf> 2.8.17 is whats on the server
[07:51:58] <gnarf> 3.x inside node
[07:52:08] <gnarf> lemme see if i can find a source for a 3.x sqlite for debian
[07:52:41] <gnarf> try sqlite3 plugins.db
[07:54:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^
[07:55:21] <scott_gonzalez> That works.
[07:55:26] <scott_gonzalez> I swear I tried this before and it failed.
[07:55:33] <scott_gonzalez> Did you just install it?
[07:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> Well, that actions table looks exactly like what I'd expect.
[07:56:20] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna clean this out and make sure it empties.
[07:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> GAH, how do I get out of sqlite?
[07:57:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, ".quit"
[07:57:47] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, this is working how I expect.
[07:57:54] <scott_gonzalez> I just can't find the last-action file.
[07:58:05] <scott_gonzalez> That's definitely what's causing the problem.
[07:58:32] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, apt-get install sqlite3
[07:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'll fix the code, sicne it's obviously wrong
[07:58:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can you make that based on the dir of the file or something?
[07:59:00] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I want it to be in the root of the repo.
[07:59:04] <scott_gonzalez> That's what the code expects.
[07:59:08] <gnarf> cool
[07:59:29] <gnarf> so
[07:59:36] <gnarf> what are the important "data" files to backup here
[07:59:38] <gnarf> *.db ?
[08:03:13] <scott_gonzalez> plugins.db
[08:03:20] <gnarf> cool
[08:03:38] <scott_gonzalez> Which is why that path is configurable :-)
[08:07:42] <jqcommit> 01[13plugins.jquery.com01] 15scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/ZVFkUg
[08:07:42] <jqcommit> 13plugins.jquery.com/06master 14348f411 15Scott González: Ensure the path to last-action is correct.
[08:07:55] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's try this again...
[08:08:08] <scott_gonzalez> stop the processes
[08:10:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i'm mid puppet run, you can find the PID of the manager and kill -INT it
[08:10:11] <gnarf> installing backup script
[08:10:15] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:10:58] <gnarf> i use /etc/init.d/plugins start to start it
[08:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> plugins@jq02:/var/www/plugins.jquery.com$ /etc/init.d/plugins start
[08:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> Directory /usr/local/var/run does not exist. Modify the 'plugins' init.d script (/etc/init.d/plugins) accordingly
[08:11:16] <gnarf> sudo it
[08:11:24] <gnarf> need to be root to get to the /var/run
[08:11:30] <gnarf> it sudo's the exec as plugins tho
[08:12:32] <scott_gonzalez> awesome pid: 20000 ?        Sl     0:00 /usr/local/bin/node /var/www/plugins.jquery.com/scripts/manager.js
[08:12:52] <gnarf> want me to send tests?
[08:13:39] <gnarf> hrm
[08:13:42] <gnarf> howd we dupe color
[08:13:59] <gnarf> did we both hit test hook? :)
[08:14:01] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[08:14:07] <scott_gonzalez> I guess there's a race condition :-(
[08:14:20] <gnarf> limit one working process per repo?
[08:14:41] <scott_gonzalez> Well, there is only one process.
[08:15:11] <gnarf> so how did it get 2.1.2 twice then?
[08:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> Because it processes requests in parallel.
[08:15:28] <scott_gonzalez> We must've been right on top of each other.
[08:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> So when it checked if we processed the 2.1.2 tag yet, the answer was no for both.
[08:15:53] <gnarf> right
[08:15:55] <scott_gonzalez> Because neither script had gotten to the point where it marked it.
[08:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> So it's one process, but it's as if it were threaded.
[08:16:07] <gnarf> one "parallel" per repo maybe?
[08:16:28] <gnarf> so we need to get jquery migrate up on this thing too yes?
[08:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> Probably not a bad idea.
[08:17:33] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: you around?
[08:17:44] <DaveMethvin> yessir gnarf
[08:17:46] <gnarf> I'll work on getting the manifest task ported over
[08:18:18] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[08:18:35] <gnarf> I could retag 1.0.0 on it
[08:18:41] <gnarf> so that the version doesn't get lost
[08:19:04] <DaveMethvin> so gnarf you lookin for me?
[08:19:18] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, just a heads up that we are working on adding jquery-migrate to plugins
[08:19:28] <DaveMethvin> sounds like a good idea
[08:19:32] <gnarf> i'm gonna need to re-tag 1.0.0 tho
[08:19:44] <gnarf> or we need to bump to 1.0.1 for no new code
[08:19:48] <gnarf> which seems sillier
[08:19:54] <DaveMethvin> i don't think it will affect too many people
[08:19:57] <DaveMethvin> go ahead
[08:20:06] <gnarf> Is there a "download page" for it?
[08:20:21] <DaveMethvin> no, it's in the readme
[08:22:03] <gnarf> Mind if I change the header to "Download" so its #download instead of #development-vs-production-versions
[08:22:10] <gnarf> then i can link to the readme on the tag
[08:22:17] <DaveMethvin> go ahead, thanks
[08:22:35] <DaveMethvin> for some reason the -git version didn't update, i know i ran the script to copy that
[08:24:32] <DaveMethvin> hmmm, just not  updating, even after a purge
[08:26:19] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: whats this mean: https://gist.github.com/583c340c8e70e0e16f73
[08:26:30] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: cache headers?
[08:26:52] <DaveMethvin> it means there's some sort of version problem, i don't get that
[08:27:07] <DaveMethvin> i think you're in grunt version hell
[08:27:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: is maintainer required?
[08:27:34] <scott_gonzalez> No, just author: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/docs/manifest.md#required-fields
[08:27:49] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: any idea how i fix it?
[08:28:06] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: lemme look, i've never seen that message
[08:28:45] <DaveMethvin> doing a new npm install
[08:29:20] <DaveMethvin> oh boom, my npm install won't even work
[08:29:29] <DaveMethvin> gnarf did yours work?
[08:30:13] <DaveMethvin> oh it's that stupid python2 dep
[08:30:47] <gnarf> my install worked
[08:31:02] <DaveMethvin> well mine USED TO
[08:31:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://gist.github.com/86f39ed6e1b71b56b936 hows this look for a manifest?
[08:32:36] <DaveMethvin> gnarf, this is the crazy grunt rc4/rc5 mess, i hadn't re-npm-installed since that 
[08:33:01] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: sorry if i broke your build :(
[08:33:17] <DaveMethvin> no this is the grunt problem
[08:33:29] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano figured out the correct commits that actualy work together for rc4
[08:33:36] <DaveMethvin> that's what we're using in jquery now
[08:33:53] <DaveMethvin> lemme see if i can grab the right stuff fromt here
[08:34:09] <scott_gonzalez> Should be good.
[08:36:35] <gnarf> hrm, this isn't working
[08:37:37] <DaveMethvin> ok gnarf i'm pushing a change to the package.json that i hope will fix it
[08:37:44] <gnarf> k
[08:38:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Any idea why this doesn't result in anything happening? https://gist.github.com/0c1b6e763899853248aa
[08:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> Should be mimicking a web hook.
[08:38:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no 
[08:38:51] <scott_gonzalez> It works locally when I point it directly at the node server.
[08:39:32] <gnarf> try sending your payload?
[08:39:51] <gnarf> im tcpdumping the 8001 on jq01
[08:39:53] <gnarf> er jq02
[08:39:55] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: dog walking for about half an hour but i'll check back 
[08:39:57] <gnarf> (stage)
[08:40:07] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: cool
[08:40:38] <gnarf> yup worked
[08:40:41] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: ^
[08:40:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: did you run that?
[08:41:15] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: about to send it now
[08:41:25] <gnarf> watching :)
[08:41:30] <scott_gonzalez> sent
[08:41:39] <gnarf> never received
[08:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> :0/
[08:41:48] <gnarf> i got the test hook from github
[08:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> I'm gonna log out the response I get.
[08:42:57] <gnarf> http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/postreceive-hook
[08:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> d'oh
[08:43:19] <scott_gonzalez> My bad
[08:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> Not sending a length header.
[08:43:38] <scott_gonzalez> nginx cares about that, node doesn't.
[08:43:58] <gnarf> k
[08:44:06] <gnarf> need help figuring out what i did wrong with migrate
[08:44:14] <gnarf> the 1.0.0 tag isn't getting detected
[08:45:28] <gnarf> we need to work on the feedback loop for this... 
[08:46:29] <scott_gonzalez> BOOM!
[08:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/
[08:47:01] <gnarf> only found 1.9.0 ?
[08:47:32] <gnarf> also, i think the "hours ago" math is off
[08:47:33] <gnarf> :)
[08:47:41] <gnarf> maybe not using GMT times?
[08:48:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's time of commit.
[08:48:19] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..
[08:48:20] <gnarf> http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/requestAnimationFrame/ 9 hours ago
[08:48:24] <gnarf> i did that like <1 hr ago
[08:48:25] <scott_gonzalez> So it's off by 8 hours?
[08:48:27] <gnarf> yeah
[08:48:37] <gnarf> machine is in PST 
[08:48:39] <gnarf> so thats -8
[08:49:00] <gnarf> more important
[08:49:05] <gnarf> what'd i fuck up with migrate? :)
[08:49:29] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check.
[08:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> SHIT, UI meetieng in 10 minutes.
[08:50:37] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: do you want the bugs url for migrate to be bugs.jquery.com or issues btw?
[08:50:54] <scott_gonzalez> [ 'Invalid data type for bugs; must be a string.' ]
[08:51:22] <scott_gonzalez> We can add support for this.
[08:51:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: package.json likes bugs: { url: "" } ?
[08:51:54] <scott_gonzalez> It should be bugs: "..."
[08:52:11] <scott_gonzalez> We don't support the extended version.
[08:52:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I might add support for that?
[08:53:07] <scott_gonzalez> We can do that.
[08:53:18] <gnarf> ill put together a pull
[08:53:47] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...looks like we're not even using it for anything right now.
[08:54:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Make sure to include tests :-)
[08:58:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: speaking of tests
[08:59:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you think we could make a /test-manifest url ?
[08:59:13] <gnarf> for end users
[08:59:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, I just haven't gotten there yet.

[09:05:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^^^ does that commit look ok?
[09:06:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: tests pass
[09:07:49] <gnarf> i figured if there wasn't a .url on the bugs object, we'd want to still fail
[09:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> We don't want to modify the manifest object.
[09:16:47] <scott_gonzalez> I think it gets passed around a lot and is stored at the end.
[09:17:28] <scott_gonzalez> Also, the error message would be incorrect if they did something like bugs: { url: 5 }
[09:17:39] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: fixing
[09:17:40] <gnarf> :)
[09:20:45] <gnarf> so where does it read bugs from then?
[09:21:12] <scott_gonzalez> What do you mean?
[09:22:14] <gnarf> if i don't modify manifest.bugs
[09:22:25] <gnarf> i have to make sure wherever it uses manifest.bugs it uses manifest.bugs.url too
[09:22:27] <gnarf> right?
[09:22:29] <scott_gonzalez> We're not currently reading it anywhere.
[09:22:38] <gnarf> how does it display it on the wp side then?
[09:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> It doesn't, does it?
[09:23:12] <gnarf> oh
[09:23:15] <gnarf> you're right
[09:23:16] <gnarf> :)
[09:23:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why it doesn't.
[09:24:09] <scott_gonzalez> But, if we add it, we just need to check for both on display.
[09:24:21] <scott_gonzalez> There are helper functions in jquery-wp-content for each field.
[09:24:26] <scott_gonzalez> So it would be handled there.

[09:30:46] <gnarf> how about this push ?
[09:32:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: where do i look for a good icon for a bugs url link?
[09:32:45] <scott_gonzalez> Is this supposed to be an object? https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/commit/d5b79d659367f97380bc8be3eba8ad005c676838#L1R400
[09:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like a dupe of an earlier test.
[09:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> icons: http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/
[09:33:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it tests that bugs: 5 is bad
[09:33:43] <gnarf> bugs: {} is bad (url is not a string)
[09:34:20] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: There's already a test for that.
[09:34:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: there were no tests on the "bugs" field before i started
[09:34:55] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you missed the tests.
[09:35:02] <scott_gonzalez> There are existing tests :-)
[09:35:02] <gnarf> er i did

[09:35:09] <gnarf> ill move mine up there
[09:35:12] <gnarf> and remove the dupe
[09:35:42] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea how I came up with the order of fields.
[09:35:57] <scott_gonzalez> But at least there are some tests :-)

[09:36:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/#icon/icon-flag ?
[09:37:42] <scott_gonzalez> That's fine with me.
[09:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Besides this, are we good to launch now?
[09:38:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i think so?
[09:38:45] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like we tracked down a few bugs and got them fixed :-)
[09:38:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: short of updating dns
[09:38:55] <gnarf> and waiting 30 minutes
[09:38:57] <scott_gonzalez> last-action file path and responding to SIGTERM for shutdowns.
[09:39:14] <scott_gonzalez> Want to try starting/stopping with init.d/puppet?
[09:39:22] <scott_gonzalez> Make sure everything is working properly now?
[09:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> Also, do you have somethin in puppet that will run `grunt setup` on first deploy?
[09:39:51] <scott_gonzalez> Or is that just something we'll do manually?
[09:40:00] <scott_gonzalez> It only happens once when the site is first setup, and never again.
[09:40:14] <gnarf> i think it does this
[09:40:16] <gnarf> ill check
[09:41:02] <scott_gonzalez> And then on subsequent deploys it should run `grunt update`
[09:41:21] <scott_gonzalez> Which just deploys documentation updates.
[09:41:45] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: ping
[09:41:53] <scott_gonzalez> We still need the blog post too.
[09:42:02] <ajpiano> yup, am on it as we speak
[09:42:23] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Not sure if you saw in #jquery-meeting, but we're gonna try to get UI out tomorrow so sites get the extra day.
[09:42:33] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be tight, but I think we can pull it off.
[09:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> Assuming plugins doesn't blow up in our faces today :-)
[09:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I just had an idea.
[09:43:22] <scott_gonzalez> You can delete all the plugins on April 1st :-P

[09:43:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can you test this wp-content commit? :)
[09:43:34] <ajpiano> that's hilar
[09:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: As soon as it hits stage, we'll know.
[09:44:58] <gnarf> can i just merge it? i did no local testing of it
[09:45:02] <gnarf> don't wanna blow shit up
[09:45:12] <gnarf> i don't have a good env for testing wp-content yet
[09:45:17] <gnarf> i gotta stand up a vm every time :)
[09:45:40] <ajpiano> i would check but i don't have data :/
[09:45:43] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, sorry, I thought that was in master.
[09:45:48] <scott_gonzalez> I can test locally real quick.
[09:45:57] <gnarf> thanks
[09:46:06] <gnarf> can you test it with a bugs: { url: "..." } too ?
[09:46:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: these setup/update tasks are already covered in puppet
[09:47:25] <gnarf> so, before i switch DNS
[09:47:35] <gnarf> do we want to do anything with redirections?
[09:48:53] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1Q3k3U1A3x3F
[09:49:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'll get this working.
[09:49:19] <gnarf> oh doh
[09:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing I know of, ajpiano: any redirects to put in place?
[09:49:33] <gnarf> json_decode goes to stdobj by default
[09:49:35] <ajpiano> for plugins?
[09:49:35] <gnarf> i fucked that up
[09:49:40] <gnarf> ajpiano: yesh
[09:49:41] <ajpiano> i don't think so
[09:49:55] <ajpiano> we should decide how long to keep archive.plugins.jquery.com running
[09:50:08] <gnarf> "running"
[09:51:38] <gnarf> alright, god help us
[09:51:44] <gnarf> i'm poking the DNS now
[09:52:09] <ajpiano> gnarf: it still seemed to be getting an lot of activit
[09:53:05] <gnarf> in ~1hr plugins.jquery.com will point at jq01
[09:53:06] <ajpiano> gnarf: hmmm
[09:53:22] <ajpiano> so right now we have a redirect to http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/projects/plugins/animation-and-effects
[09:53:31] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I've got it fixed
[09:53:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'm going to change the wording to match the other links
[09:53:37] <ajpiano> ffrom plugins.jquery.com/project/classygradient
[09:53:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: okay, do whatever and push?
[09:53:46] <ajpiano> gnarf: scott_gonzalez should we redirect all /project urls to archive?
[09:53:56] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if it should be "Report a Bug" or "View Bug Reports"
[09:54:02] <ajpiano> and then put a big disclaimer on the old site
[09:54:08] <ajpiano> well, revise the disclaimer
[09:54:13] <ajpiano> to be like THIS IS THE OLD JQUERY PLUGINS SITE
[09:54:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, thats why I just wen't with "Bug Reports" :)
[09:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Thoughts?
[09:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> text for the bugs link: http://cl.ly/image/1j061o2O1I18
[09:55:01] <ajpiano> Bug Reports makes more sense,
[09:55:02] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably fine, I just though it should match the form of the other links with a verb.
[09:55:03] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:55:05] <ajpiano> it's jtust that the other ones are verbs
[09:55:05] <ajpiano> yea
[09:55:06] <ajpiano> :/
[09:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> gonna push
[09:55:23] <gnarf> push origin :plugins-bugs too?

[10:03:23] <scott_gonzalez> What the frown for?
[10:03:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, what fail am I looking at?
[10:03:47] <gnarf> the whitespace scott_gonzalez :)

[10:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Unrelated, can we upgrade node to 0.8.17?
[10:04:31] <gnarf> simple-log
[10:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> Also, 0.10.0 is coming out soon :-)
[10:04:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[10:05:15] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, plugins still uses the git URL
[10:05:18] <scott_gonzalez> Let me fix that.

[10:08:06] <scott_gonzalez> Should work now.
[10:08:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: 0.8.17 should roll out over time
[10:08:28] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:08:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can we get a syslog on a parse error?
[10:09:04] <gnarf> i think there might be another manifest bug
[10:09:11] <gnarf> cuz i still can't get migrate to land on stage
[10:09:29] <scott_gonzalez> Well, did you try before and have it fail?
[10:09:32] <scott_gonzalez> It won't retry a tag.
[10:09:58] <scott_gonzalez> We can log all manifest errors for now, if you wnat.
[10:11:15] <gnarf> it'd be helpful if someone comes looking for help on this
[10:11:25] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: how can we force a tag retry?
[10:11:56] <scott_gonzalez> Manually modify the database :-P
[10:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> For stage, we can just blow away the database.
[10:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> I know that migrate works.
[10:12:24] <scott_gonzalez> So if you want to see it on stage, we can reset everything.
[10:13:03] <scott_gonzalez> There's no way to retry a tag. People shouldn't be doing what we're doing right now :-P
[10:13:05] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: well, it'd be nice to know what to do in the event of needing to make it reparse i guess
[10:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> Re-tagging is bad.
[10:13:37] <gnarf> agreed
[10:13:52] <scott_gonzalez> Do you want the manifest errors logged?
[10:13:53] <gnarf> this isn't a re-tag tho
[10:14:00] <gnarf> yeah, i think thats useful info
[10:14:14] <gnarf> if it gets too spamy we can clean it up
[10:14:42] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i was more thinking like there might be an error parsing a manifest, and its on our side, not theirs, we need to re-parse the tag
[10:14:50] <gnarf> how do we handle it?
[10:14:54] <scott_gonzalez> If it's valid, do it want it to log that it's valid or just do nothing?
[10:15:16] <scott_gonzalez> Right now there's no way.
[10:15:43] <scott_gonzalez> There's a repos table in plugins.db
[10:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> Which has a list of tags for each repo.
[10:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> We just need to remove the row for the bad versions.
[10:16:29] <gnarf> okay
[10:16:34] <scott_gonzalez> But we need to be careful about not removing a row for something that was properly parsed and added to the site, or it'll double up.
[10:16:42] <scott_gonzalez> So, if it happens, there's a way to fix it.
[10:16:48] <scott_gonzalez> We'd just need to be very careful.
[10:17:16] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: any way to reduce the "double up" ?
[10:17:48] <scott_gonzalez> We'd probably need to add a lot of code for that.
[10:17:54] <scott_gonzalez> It's designed for that to never happen.

[10:22:18] <jqcommit> 01[13plugins.jquery.com01] 15scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/s7vnBw
[10:22:18] <jqcommit> 13plugins.jquery.com/06master 1442e704b 15Scott González: Log all manifest errors.
[10:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's give that a second to get to stage.
[10:22:32] <scott_gonzalez> Then we can wipe the db and you can try again.
[10:22:41] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, this is the process I was using:
[10:23:03] <scott_gonzalez> stop scripts; grunt clean-all setup; start scripts
[10:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, also, go into wp-admin and delete all plugins.
[10:24:05] <scott_gonzalez> I'm restarting everythign now.
[10:25:38] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, it's ready for you to try again.
[10:26:42] <gnarf> yay http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/migrate/
[10:26:58] <gnarf> that author looks a lil funky
[10:27:00] <gnarf> but whatever
[10:27:35] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: the bugs.url in package.json on migrate points to bugs.jquery.com - not sure if this is desired, or if it should point at issues on migrate
[10:27:44] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah, we were talking about the author the other day.
[10:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> I thinka ajpiano had some CSS to fix it.
[10:28:12] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: should point at issues on migrate ... we changed our minds on that and i musta forgot to change it
[10:28:24] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: that was sort of a joke, but i guess it kind of works
[10:28:39] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: well, 1.0.0 is stuck on plugins - change it in package.json and any future versions should be correct
[10:28:41] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: I honestly didn't even look at what you suggested.
[10:28:59] <DaveMethvin> k
[10:29:19] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: also, remember to "grunt manifest" before tagging
[10:29:52] <DaveMethvin> okay i will need to study later to find out why/how of all this
[10:30:15] <gnarf> http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/project/color
[10:30:19] <gnarf> redirects properly
[10:30:26] <DaveMethvin> ah a template for me!
[10:30:29] <gnarf> everything in /project/ gets rewritten to archive for now
[10:30:57] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: yeah, it just reads a bunch of info from package.json and builds a migrate.jquery.json that you have to add on the tag
[10:32:52] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: scott_gonzalez http://cl.ly/image/1d1k1s2d0Y0m
[10:33:08] <scott_gonzalez> seems fine to em.
[10:33:13] <ajpiano> it's just putting overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; text-overflow-ellipsis; on #sidebar li a
[10:33:15] <ajpiano> ok i'll do that
[10:33:31] <scott_gonzalez> Who are these assholes with long names anyway?
[10:33:38] <ajpiano> hahaha
[10:34:38] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I like how it says the migrate plugin has ~2k forks.
[10:34:50] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, that's my local site :-P
[10:35:56] <scott_gonzalez> So, shall we go live with this? How's the blog post coming along?
[10:37:05] <ajpiano> getting there
[10:37:06] <ajpiano> sorry
[10:37:17] <scott_gonzalez> What silly commits can I do on UI to get this listed?
[10:37:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: :)
[10:37:56] <gnarf> ooo shit
[10:37:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: 
[10:38:05] <gnarf> plugins live site wasn't deployed
[10:38:10] <gnarf> so migrate is screwed now? :)
[10:38:47] <scott_gonzalez> We can blow away the db for live, nobody knows it exists yet.
[10:39:16] <scott_gonzalez> I'll tag jquery-wp-content now.
[10:40:09] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery-wp-content01] 15scottgonzalez tagged 062.0.6 at 06master: 02http://git.io/hPzUuA
[10:40:12] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: what should the ip be for stage.plugins.jquery.com?
[10:40:14] <gnarf> im trying the manual fix
[10:40:33] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: same as stage.jquery.com
[10:40:44] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: if it isn't right in DNS lemme know - ill fix
[10:40:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: need to tag plugins.jquery.com too?
[10:40:58] <DaveMethvin> i probably need to flush my local dns
[10:41:19] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, it's coming.
[10:41:26] <jqcommit> 01[13plugins.jquery.com01] 15scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/J4ZcwQ

[10:41:27] <scott_gonzalez> I used npm version for plugins.jquery.com
[10:41:28] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:42:07] <gnarf> DaveMethvin: 205.186.144.58 seems right
[10:42:21] <DaveMethvin> yeah, but http redirects me to archive
[10:42:25] <DaveMethvin> is that right?
[10:42:50] <gnarf> it should from any /project/ url
[10:42:50] <gnarf> yes
[10:42:57] <gnarf> http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/migrate/ for instance
[10:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> It's working for me.
[10:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/0J261A3x311L
[10:43:11] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Oh, nice the manual edit worked?
[10:43:24] <DaveMethvin> okay well not working for me but this seems like a larger homework project
[10:43:26] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, gonna find something to commit to UI
[10:43:44] <DaveMethvin> i'm way behind on client work so this will have to wait till tonight
[10:45:45] <gnarf> so scott_gonzalez
[10:45:49] <gnarf> its being added to repos
[10:45:55] <gnarf> but not being parsed
[10:46:00] <gnarf> and i don't see any errors in the log
[10:46:23] <scott_gonzalez> But it's on the site.
[10:47:00] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you linked to stage before.
[10:47:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, this is on live
[10:47:22] <gnarf> also
[10:47:30] <gnarf> jqueryui doesn't have postreceive for live?
[10:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> I just added it.
[10:47:40] <scott_gonzalez> And committed.
[10:47:45] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm not seeing anything.
[10:48:09] <gnarf> its in repos
[10:48:12] <gnarf> just like migrate
[10:48:15] <gnarf> but nothing parsed right
[10:48:36] <gnarf> no "actions" related to it
[10:48:39] <gnarf> (on live)
[10:49:11] <gnarf> hrm
[10:49:12] <gnarf> wtf
[10:49:15] <gnarf> live is in a weird state
[10:49:32] <gnarf> manager wasn't running
[10:50:00] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[10:50:05] <gnarf> now we have two http://plugins.jquery.com/requestAnimationFrame/
[10:50:34] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[10:50:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: just tested the HUP - works fine...
[10:50:57] <gnarf> might wanna add some logging on that signal/restart process?
[10:51:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:51:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: how do i blow up the wordpress db?
[10:51:38] <scott_gonzalez> Just log in to wp-admin and delete the jQuery Plugsin.
[10:51:44] <scott_gonzalez> Make sure to empty the trash as well.
[10:52:08] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery Plugins will have their own menu item in the side bar.
[10:52:25] <ajpiano> whoa craaaazy guys
[10:52:29] <ajpiano> the dns just hit for me
[10:52:30] <ajpiano> this is trippay
[10:52:42] <ajpiano> i miss the construction guy
[10:52:45] <gnarf> how does one "empty trash" ?
[10:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> Click on the trash link and then there will be a button.
[10:53:20] <gnarf> aha found it
[10:53:34] <gnarf> so, delete * from repos after that?
[10:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> No, use grunt.
[10:54:03] <scott_gonzalez> grunt clean-all setup
[10:57:10] <gnarf> http://plugins.jquery.com/
[10:57:23] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:57:39] <scott_gonzalez> Let me do another UI commit.
[10:57:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i test hooked
[10:58:01] <gnarf> they are adding
[10:58:10] <scott_gonzalez> I know, but I can't keep pressing that because of the other hooks.
[10:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> UI needs several runs to get everything on the site.
[10:58:28] <scott_gonzalez> Because we throttle how many items we process.
[10:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> When you test the UI hook, Trac updates :-P
[10:59:15] <gnarf> oh
[10:59:20] <gnarf> sorry
[10:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> Don't worry, I clicked it a bunch of times before noticing :-P
[11:00:13] <scott_gonzalez> All of a sudden #jqueryui-dev got chatty and Trac thought I fixed the same bug like 5 times...
[11:00:25] <scott_gonzalez> I think the tests always do the last 3 commits.
[11:00:41] <scott_gonzalez> So I just need to get far enough that none of the other scripts will care.
[11:01:36] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, the guy who submitted this bug is gonna be like "WTF is going on?" http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8950#
[11:01:41] <scott_gonzalez> That's the one that keeps updating.
[11:01:48] <scott_gonzalez> But I keep deleting the duplicate comments.
[11:02:03] <gnarf> heh
[11:02:12] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, gonna try sending a test hook now.
[11:02:33] <ajpiano> gnarf:  scott_gonzalez i just realised a documentation we needed :/
[11:02:40] <ajpiano> "Downloading Plugins"
[11:02:44] <ajpiano> pretty simple but it should be there
[11:02:52] <scott_gonzalez> Click the download link
[11:02:53] <scott_gonzalez> done
[11:02:57] <ajpiano> the fact that everything on the site just links you to another website
[11:03:05] <ajpiano> that you then have to right click and save as target
[11:03:06] <ajpiano> seems obvious
[11:03:11] <ajpiano> except to people who it doesn't seem obvious to
[11:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Feel free to write it :-) https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/tree/master/site-content/page/docs
[11:03:31] <gnarf> ajpiano: the download link doesn't go straight to the zip always
[11:03:39] <gnarf> in fact, none of the ones released currently do
[11:03:43] <ajpiano> right
[11:03:51] <gnarf> except http://plugins.jquery.com/requestAnimationFrame/
[11:03:54] <ajpiano> that's why there should be a page that explains what people can expect
[11:04:01] <scott_gonzalez> Yay, test hooks for UI don't trigger Trac updates now.
[11:04:18] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah, i suppose i will right now
[11:05:12] <scott_gonzalez> Gonna give that a minute to catch up.
[11:05:26] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if it's processing everything or it'll need one more hook.
[11:05:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://plugins.jquery.com/ui.progressbar/1.10.0-rc.1/ wrapping on "version" ?
[11:05:59] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like it's all caught up now.
[11:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> oy
[11:06:30] <gnarf> you'd think the release date would be the thing that wrapped there
[11:06:33] <gnarf> but yeah
[11:06:37] <gnarf> long version # 
[11:07:48] <scott_gonzalez> I'll push a fix in a minute.
[11:12:48] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so how does it determine the .json file name to read?
[11:13:03] <scott_gonzalez> It reads all *.jquery.json files from the root.
[11:13:22] <gnarf> k

[11:15:17] <scott_gonzalez> That should allow longer versions.
[11:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> I tested with 2.10.0-beta.5
[11:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> Which is pretty wide.
[11:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, using alpha makes it drop to 2 lines.
[11:16:27] <scott_gonzalez> We can always tweak that as we notice problems.
[11:17:28] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, I just noticed what's causing the annoying spacing in the entire sidebar.
[11:17:34] <scott_gonzalez> Fixing that will help too :-)

[11:26:14] <danheberden> ha, custom entry in my hosts file
[11:26:24] <danheberden> must have been when i was trying to recover a particular db
[11:26:42] <danheberden> the the one that shall not be named accidentally deleted
[11:26:51] <gnarf> seriously - fuck grunt 0.4.0 right in an ear... I can't get 0.4.0 to work worth a shit on this plugin
[11:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> There's a reason UI is still on 0.3.17
[11:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Heh, aweseome
[11:28:02] <gnarf> i started out with an 0.4.0 init (on ben's advice) with this plugin
[11:28:03] <danheberden> gnarf: maybe we could make a grunt-fuck-ear plugin?
[11:28:06] <gnarf> but now i can't get it working
[11:28:27] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Because Ben re-tagged stuff.
[11:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> And it's busted.
[11:28:35] <DaveMethvin> gnarf: this is what I did to get -migrate to work: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/commit/cd249386942fda05e41fa4249be1faabcfc05a77
[11:28:45] <DaveMethvin> you have to give specific commits since the versions mean NOTHING!
[11:28:59] <DaveMethvin> kinda like core.
[11:29:02] <DaveMethvin> :)
[11:29:21] <DaveMethvin> oh damn i added cli there
[11:29:23] <DaveMethvin> oh well
[11:29:38] <scott_gonzalez> WHAT A MESS
[11:32:34] <gnarf> so like
[11:32:42] <gnarf> is there still a <strip_banner> type thing around?
[11:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> I don't remember, I think banners changed.
[11:43:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://plugins.jquery.com/inline-easing/
[11:43:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i just managed to dupe that
[11:43:22] <gnarf> with git push ; git push --tags
[11:43:25] <scott_gonzalez> :-(
[11:43:31] <gnarf> duped on its own
[11:43:59] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see if I can do the throttling you suggested.
[11:44:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can i manually delete one of those from wp-admin ?
[11:45:00] <gnarf> or will it show back up?
[11:45:12] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but is it duplicated in the plugins db as well?
[11:46:21] <gnarf> not in "repos"
[11:46:22] <gnarf> no
[11:48:28] <gnarf> i deleted the double version in wp-admin (or i thought i did) but it still shows up
[11:48:59] <jqcommit> 01[13jquery-wp-content01] 15ajpiano pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/5ECARg

[11:49:33] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's probably in the metadata.
[11:50:03] <scott_gonzalez> You probably need to go into the MySQL DB to fix that.
[11:50:16] <scott_gonzalez> There's a field for latest version and all versions.
[11:50:43] <scott_gonzalez> Let me see how this table is being generated though.
[11:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> Cuz it *should* just be querying for posts.
[11:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it uses the versions metadata.
[11:53:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i just added gnarf37@gmail.com to my gravatar
[11:53:26] <gnarf> and it still not showing up
[11:59:49] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: do you think we should include package.json spec in the site content
[11:59:51] <ajpiano> i tend to think so
[12:00:04] <ajpiano> and mentioning it in the publishing your plugin docs
[12:00:25] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:00:27] <ajpiano> i'm realising all these little things as i'm writing the post
[12:00:38] <gnarf> ajpiano: *.jquery.json spec you mean?
[12:00:43] <ajpiano> yea
[12:00:55] <ajpiano> using grunt to generate it
[12:01:10] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: There are multiple managers running.
[12:01:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: bah
[12:01:27] <scott_gonzalez> That's why it double posted.
[12:02:07] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: lemme see if i can figure out whats causing that
[12:03:59] <gnarf> i'm thinking puppet might of started a second manager
[12:05:23] <gnarf> although that doesn't make a lot of sense
[12:05:35] <gnarf> even running /etc/init.d/plugins start again doesn't give me nother manager
[12:05:55] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[12:08:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: After we get this all sorted out, we need to setup api.jqueryui.com/1.9/
[12:08:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: okay
[12:10:03] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/docs/manifest.md - am i good to move that from where it is and into site_content/pages/docs/package-manifest.md
[12:10:04] <jquicommit> 01[13api.jqueryui.com01] 15scottgonzalez created 061-9 from 06master (+0 new commits): 02http://git.io/AGrPAA
[12:10:09] <ajpiano> and that will be the canoincial location going forward?
[12:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'd remove the LIVING SPEC header.
[12:11:32] <ajpiano> yah, i'm gonna clean it up a drop, that was the main thing
[12:12:14] <scott_gonzalez> Also, if we're going to continue using color as an example, we should use the 2.1.2 manifest.
[12:12:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no idea what caused the double manager
[12:13:02] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: but i think i fixed a problem
[12:13:07] <ajpiano> cool, i'll move it in there now
[12:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:13:58] <ajpiano> erm
[12:14:18] <ajpiano> where is the *.jquery.json* file in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color
[12:14:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so, /1.9/ already setup in wp-content?
[12:14:39] <gnarf> ajpiano: /jquery/jquery-color/blob/2.1.2/color.jquery.json
[12:15:14] <gnarf> ajpiano: it gets added on the leaf node for the version
[12:15:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I'm working on that right now.
[12:15:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: working on the puppet configs for it
[12:15:33] <ajpiano> ok...
[12:15:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: branch name 1-9 ?
[12:16:08] <scott_gonzalez> ugh
[12:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yeah, 1-9
[12:16:17] <scott_gonzalez> Here we go again....
[12:16:54] <scott_gonzalez> We really need to make the site installer smarter.
[12:16:58] <scott_gonzalez> So it handles skipping sites.
[12:17:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: builders coming online in a few
[12:20:29] <ajpiano> oh god scott_gonzalez :/
[12:20:38] <ajpiano> trying to build the plugins site locally is blowing up in the syslog :.
[12:20:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: 1.10 tags should deploy to main now, 1.9 deploys to /1.9/
[12:21:55] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:21:56] <gnarf> ajpiano: run with --console
[12:22:03] <scott_gonzalez> I'll have something on stage in a minute.
[12:22:07] <ajpiano> whoa
[12:22:25] <danheberden> my momma always told me to never run with --console
[12:22:32] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: the grunt docs task is failing
[12:22:57] <ajpiano> it's erroring "getting post paths from wordpress"
[12:23:06] <ajpiano> maybe i should nuke the db for my docs pages, i haven't deploy locally in forever
[12:23:19] <danheberden> the... plugins db?
[12:23:25] <gnarf> ajpiano: grunt clean-all setup ?
[12:23:47] <gnarf> danheberden: yes? :)
[12:23:55] <gnarf> i'm quickly gobbling up names 
[12:24:03] <gnarf> I need to package my ajaxQueue plugin up quick
[12:24:07] <gnarf> so noone else can steal the name
[12:24:08] <gnarf> :)
[12:24:17] <danheberden> i feel like i should be upgrading all of my plugins to the right spec
[12:25:00] <ajpiano> gnarf: no diece
[12:25:05] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: That's odd.
[12:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> Did you `npm install` recently?
[12:25:41] <ajpiano> yeah
[12:25:50] <ajpiano> i just pulled and npm installed

[12:28:01] <ajpiano> omg omg
[12:28:12] <ajpiano> wat a noob
[12:29:21] <ajpiano> having an up to date package manifest helps

[12:29:31] <ajpiano> ..
[12:29:41] <ajpiano> was going to... dev.plugins.jquery.com
[12:30:06] <ajpiano> all good now, sorry

[12:30:27] <jquicommit> 13api.jqueryui.com/061-9 1440ab01f 15Scott González: Added todo for changing wording to encourage people to use 1.10.
[12:30:29] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[12:30:33] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let's see if that updates stage.
[12:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> YAY http://stage.api.jqueryui.com/1.9/
[12:32:10] <ajpiano> oh wow
[12:32:22] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: plugins.jquery.com doesn't *use* grunt-jquery-content :/
[12:33:03] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, it uses grunt-wordpress directly.
[12:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> It does custom stuff.
[12:33:24] <scott_gonzalez> Like only syncing pages.
[12:33:28] <ajpiano> hmm
[12:33:39] <ajpiano> well it is misnaming the file if i call it "package-manifest"
[12:33:43] <ajpiano> doesnt' parse markdown etc
[12:33:49] <ajpiano> so it's kind of a party pooper
[12:34:10] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..
[12:34:40] <ajpiano> it just creates a page caled "package-manife"
[12:34:46] <ajpiano> we could have it use grunt-jquery-content only for docs, ostensibly?
[12:35:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we should be able to add grunt-jquery-content.
[12:35:59] <scott_gonzalez> grunt-jquery-content should only be dealing with pre-processing.
[12:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> and grunt-wordpress deals with publishing.
[12:36:14] <scott_gonzalez> The custom stuff we're doing is related to publishing.
[12:36:28] <scott_gonzalez> So it should be fine to add grunt-jquery-content and use the build-pages task.
[12:36:43] <ajpiano> ok
[12:37:36] <scott_gonzalez> Line 27 is where we override wordpress-get-postpaths to force it to only update pages.
[12:37:55] <scott_gonzalez> But that shouldn't be affected by adding grunt-jquery-content.
[12:39:09] <ajpiano> the existing process never builds a dist folder
[12:39:32] <ajpiano> i should be able to get this in, i presume
[12:39:51] <scott_gonzalez> Right, because there's no pre-processing.
[12:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> It should be straight-forward to add that in though.
[12:40:35] <scott_gonzalez> Line 44 hard-codes a path.
[12:40:58] <scott_gonzalez> We'll need to change that to be the dist folder.
[12:40:58] <ajpiano> yeah, i see that
[12:41:03] <ajpiano> exactly
[12:41:34] <scott_gonzalez> And, while you're at it, since we're going to be doing a pre-processing step, we can remove the page directory.
[12:41:42] <scott_gonzalez> So that site-content just has the docs directly.
[12:41:50] <ajpiano> and move the existing docs up
[12:41:51] <ajpiano> ha
[12:41:52] <ajpiano> yea
[12:42:04] <ajpiano> or we could get rid of the site-content directory
[12:42:09] <ajpiano> and have it called "pages" just like all the other sites
[12:42:11] <ajpiano> at the top level?
[12:42:15] <scott_gonzalez> We can do that too.
[12:42:35] <ajpiano> gonna go w/ that
[12:59:30] <gnarf> http://plugins.jquery.com/ajaxQueue/
[12:59:32] <gnarf> yay!
[12:59:33] <gnarf> anyway
[13:00:03] <gnarf> shit
[13:00:04] <gnarf> tags
[13:00:05] <gnarf> lame
[13:00:07] <gnarf> lol
[13:00:09] <scott_gonzalez> 0 watchers 0 forks
[13:00:19] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:00:22] <scott_gonzalez> way to go
[13:00:32] <scott_gonzalez> At least your gravatar is working :-)
[13:00:50] <scott_gonzalez> Well, in maintainers anyway.
[13:00:56] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it wasn't a plugin on github til liek an hour ago, it was just a gist :)
[13:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:05:50] <ajpiano> woo
[13:05:53] <ajpiano> got it going
[13:08:05] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:08:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: do we need a if block around the "demo" link/
[13:08:07] <gnarf> ?
[13:08:34] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:10:31] <gnarf> we should find a way to make this: http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=animation show the animation tag as well
[13:10:54] <gnarf> anyway
[13:10:59] <gnarf> any other jquery content stuff today?
[13:11:06] <gnarf> or stuff we can prep on for tomorrow?
[13:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: FWIW, this shit all used to be implemented.
[13:12:27] <scott_gonzalez> I have 1 guess as to who removed all my code.
[13:12:34] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/5787a3066dab8b51548ef30a2f7362f05d067c94/themes/plugins-jquery-com/content-jquery_plugin.php#L59
[13:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> homepage, demo, docs all need conditionals.
[13:16:02] <ajpiano> gnarf: want to help write the "downloading and including plugins" page :p
[13:16:13] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: about to push the revised build with docs moved
[13:16:22] <ajpiano> i don't think anything shoudl break

[13:19:46] <ajpiano> i thought i got them all
[13:19:51] <gnarf> ajpiano: the update process?
[13:20:04] <gnarf> er rather the deploy process calls update
[13:20:11] <ajpiano> ok
[13:20:12] <ajpiano> my b
[13:20:18] <gnarf> can you registerTask( 'update', [ 'deploy' ] ) ?
[13:20:32] <ajpiano> i'm just gonan change docs back to update
[13:20:41] <gnarf> k
[13:21:29] <scott_gonzalez> No, don't call deploy.

[13:21:38] <gnarf> ajpiano: you got any "starter text" or "bullet points" for me to start with even ?
[13:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> Just make update call sync-docs like it used ot.
[13:21:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i thought he had renamed update to deploy
[13:22:03] <ajpiano> already done scott_gonzalez
[13:22:07] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[13:22:08] <ajpiano> i had renamed update to docs
[13:22:20] <ajpiano> but now it's back to how it was
[13:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> Wait, you changed the clean task?
[13:22:28] <gnarf> *bump*
[13:22:48] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I see, clean -> clean-retries
[13:22:51] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i renamed "clean" to "clean-retries"
[13:22:53] <ajpiano> cause i...
[13:22:53] <ajpiano> yeah
[13:23:00] <ajpiano> had to include grunt-clean
[13:23:37] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, this looks good
[13:23:41] <ajpiano> gnarf: basically just.... clicking download... i'm either gonna get a zip file, or i'm gonna get a link to a website where i have to pick what to download
[13:23:54] <ajpiano> that, and then... how do i get that code into my app, and then confirm it's there
[13:24:01] <ajpiano> so like...download... adding script tag
[13:24:02] <ajpiano> nothing too crazy
[13:24:27] <ajpiano> so does http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/docs/package-manifest/ :)
[13:24:49] <gnarf> ajpiano: so its gonna be crazy no matter what
[13:24:59] <ajpiano> gnarf: why?
[13:25:24] <gnarf> I could get a zip, I could get a link to js directly, I could get a link to a download page, etc
[13:25:45] <ajpiano> that's what i'm saying
[13:25:49] <ajpiano> this documentation needs to explain
[13:25:53] <ajpiano> :)
[13:26:03] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: You wanted to link to that from http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/ right?
[13:26:27] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah, but there wasn't a link there to change yet
[13:26:27] <ajpiano> :p
[13:26:32] <ajpiano> so i'll circle back to it
[13:26:54] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:27:09] <ajpiano> gnarf: talking about how to choose the full or min, if avail
[13:27:31] <ajpiano> just the things like, a complete noob might not know about how to go from not having a plugin to being able to call $("Foo").snazzy();
[13:27:55] <gnarf> ajpiano: basically its like "read whatever page you get linked to" or "find the readme in the zip"
[13:27:56] <gnarf> :)
[13:28:36] <ajpiano> i can do it if you don't feel like there's anythign to do ;)
[13:28:41] <ajpiano> there's certainly what to cover
[13:28:49] <ajpiano> if you have other stuff to do for getting ready for ui release
[13:28:56] <gnarf> im starting on it
[13:28:58] <gnarf> http://oksoclap.com/Ni157a54yR
[13:29:12] <ajpiano> ah ok
[13:29:18] <ajpiano> just jam on it for a little bit
[13:29:49] <ajpiano> like obvi none of the ways are too complicated, but having a 1 sentence explanation of each one does a lot for us
[13:32:21] <gnarf> yeah
[13:32:28] <gnarf> :shrug:
[13:35:06] <scott_gonzalez> Stepping away for a while (dinner and whatnot).
[13:36:33] <ajpiano> cool
[13:36:47] <ajpiano> i donno if we are gonna get this out "today" but we should be in position to announce tom
[13:36:54] <gnarf> this shit is hard ajpiano
[13:36:55] <ajpiano> and just power through stuff this evening
[13:37:05] <gnarf> i can't write this :)
[13:37:10] <ajpiano> gnarf: haha ok
[13:37:12] <ajpiano> i'll take it
[13:37:16] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like we can launch without this page.
[13:37:16] <gnarf> it's like instinct for me ya ?
[13:37:18] <ajpiano> you just asked if there was other content stuff to do
[13:37:24] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yeah def
[13:37:32] <ajpiano> but i'm still finishing the post
[13:37:35] <gnarf> ajpiano: i mean, a blog post is all we need ya?
[13:37:40] <gnarf> I could try to help with that :)
[13:37:40] <ajpiano> i guess
[13:37:43] <ajpiano> i was gonna link to this page
[13:37:48] <ajpiano> gnarf: that would be rad
[13:37:56] <ajpiano> i'll put it in this clap, i've been jammin through it but there's more i want to hit
[13:37:57] <gnarf> got a clap?
[13:37:59] <gnarf> k
[13:38:31] <ajpiano> you see i stopped right when i didn't have a package manifest page to link to :p
[13:41:21] <gnarf> :)
[13:42:32] <ajpiano> gnarf: that actually makes sense
[13:42:41] <ajpiano> for you to flesh out the publishing docs
[13:42:49] <gnarf> k
[13:43:13] <ajpiano> jacobroufa: we want to support other things besides github
[13:43:17] <ajpiano> but github was our first target
[13:43:23] <ajpiano> cause of critical mass, etc
[13:43:50] <ajpiano> something i'm planning to get in here as well :p
[13:44:13] <jacobroufa> ajpiano: word
[13:44:26] <jacobroufa> i mean, i dont disagree that gh is important in the dev community at large
[13:44:27] <gnarf> ajpiano: jacobroufa is one of my friends from my rockford js group
[13:44:28] <gnarf> :)
[13:44:36] <jacobroufa> but the features arent exclusive to gh, ya know?
[13:44:44] <jacobroufa> like, i can tag *any* git repo
[13:45:08] <jacobroufa> i think that git, as a vcs standard for developing jquery plugins, could (should?) be enforced
[13:45:15] <jacobroufa> but maybe not that host, ya know?
[13:45:18] <ajpiano> jacobroufa: we know
[13:45:42] <ajpiano> :)
[13:45:52] <jacobroufa> lol sorry if im not trying to hinder progress here
[13:46:12] <jacobroufa> its a little thing that doesnt quite make sense to me, thats all
[13:46:16] <ajpiano> no not atll
[13:46:19] <jacobroufa> is it because of githubs webhooks?
[13:46:24] <jacobroufa> gnarf: ^^
[13:46:25] <ajpiano> yeah i'm curious really
[13:46:28] <gnarf> jacobroufa: we plan to support others 
[13:46:31] <ajpiano> what would happen if you put the post-receive
[13:46:34] <ajpiano> in a bitbucket url
[13:46:40] <ajpiano> right now i think we look at certain things from the github payload
[13:46:52] <gnarf> basically, we only wrote hooks for github so fr
[13:47:00] <jacobroufa> word
[13:47:03] <jacobroufa> because y'all use it
[13:47:07] <jacobroufa> infrastructure exists
[13:47:10] <jacobroufa> i get that much :)
[13:47:11] <gnarf> with contributions for other repos we will get it up and running for others i'm sure
[13:47:42] <gnarf> afaik this is the only reason it's "github only" is that we haven't yet developed others
[13:47:52] <ajpiano> yup
[13:47:57] <jacobroufa> gotcha
[13:48:00] <ajpiano> mayve we should just put this section on the Publishing Your Plugin page
[13:50:11] <gnarf> ajpiano: working on this a bit below the blog post
[13:50:18] <ajpiano> coool
[13:53:55] <gnarf> ajpiano: i added a "add a manifest" block
[13:54:05] <gnarf> and working on the "trouble publishing" section
[13:54:24] <ajpiano> sweet
[13:54:34] <gnarf> I was thinking about putting something in about forums/irc
[13:56:15] <ajpiano> for what, getting help?
[13:56:47] <gnarf> yeah
[13:56:57] <gnarf> for publishing plugins
[13:57:09] <ajpiano> yeah
[13:57:14] <ajpiano> i guess we'd send people here, eh?
[13:57:17] <gnarf> where should we send em?
[13:57:33] <ajpiano> here's better than "e-mail us"
[13:57:34] <ajpiano> lol
[13:57:48] <gnarf> how about here and e-mail us? :)
[13:57:49] <ajpiano> though we can keep that too, if necessary
[13:57:52] <ajpiano> yeah: )
[13:57:59] <gnarf> plugins@jquery.com ?
[13:58:32] <DaveMethvin> "poke us on Facebook"
[13:58:35] <ajpiano> isn't that what was there
[13:58:38] <ajpiano> howdy DaveMethvin
[13:58:42] <DaveMethvin> hey
[13:59:36] <gnarf> ajpiano: nothing in the current docs about it
[14:00:08] <ajpiano> ahhh yikes
[14:00:12] <ajpiano> i mistook the part on http://stage.plugins.jquery.com/docs/names/
[14:00:17] <ajpiano> where it says "contact a jquery team member"
[14:00:20] <ajpiano> jeez that needs to be fixe
[14:00:31] <ajpiano> we should tell them to e-mail plugins or come here
[14:00:37] <gnarf> ajpiano: we could spawn a #jquery-plugins to keep the noise out of -content ?
[14:00:49] <gnarf> or should we invite the noise here
[14:00:49] <ajpiano> "hunt down anyone on the jquery team" lol
[14:01:05] <ajpiano> let's invite it here for now
[14:01:15] <ajpiano> cause it's a new system, shit breaking is probably gonna be bugs
[14:01:29] <ajpiano> if we need #jquery-plugins, we can spawn it, but for right nwo plugins are just... a form of content :o
[14:01:30] <ajpiano> :p
[14:01:46] <gnarf> k
[14:01:53] <gnarf> brb - brewing a pot
[14:13:41] <gnarf> proof on "publishing" portion at the bottom of the clap anyone? http://oksoclap.com/Ni157a54yR
[14:14:38] <gnarf> ajpiano: ^ ?
[14:14:40] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^?
[14:14:43] <ajpiano> looking
[14:14:59] <ajpiano> this is better for now

[14:23:22] <gnarf> so hey
[14:23:31] <gnarf> unrelated question
[14:23:33] <gnarf> board members page
[14:23:41] <gnarf> are these people in any particular order?
[14:23:45] <gnarf> and who forgot to add me
[14:24:17] <ajpiano> wat, you're first
[14:24:39] <ajpiano> i have no IDEA what order these are in, lol
[14:24:44] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/blob/master/pages/team.html
[14:25:09] <gnarf> http://stage.jquery.org/team/ :)
[14:25:15] <ajpiano> ah
[14:25:16] <ajpiano> i mean
[14:25:21] <ajpiano> also none of us look like yoda
[14:25:22] <ajpiano> ;)
[14:25:26] <gnarf> yes
[14:25:29] <gnarf> this i understand
[14:25:29] <ajpiano> http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics-Tagging
[14:25:36] <ajpiano> i just assume that page is somehow a bit stale
[14:26:04] <gnarf> it seems up to date to me
[14:26:20] <ajpiano> lol
[14:26:21] <ajpiano> git blame
[14:26:26] <gnarf> no
[14:26:26] <ajpiano> :p
[14:26:29] <gnarf> sorry
[14:26:37] <gnarf> i linked your link on tagging to stale
[14:26:40] <gnarf> not the board page
[14:26:48] <gnarf> yeah, its stale
[14:26:53] <gnarf> but who forgot me!@#? :)
[14:26:55] <ajpiano> ahhhh
[14:27:03] <ajpiano> i thought http://jquery.org/team/ as in my clipboard
[14:27:09] <ajpiano> when i pasted that
[14:27:10] <ajpiano> lol
[14:28:17] <gnarf> hey
[14:28:45] <gnarf> should i add a <code>git tag 0.1.0; git push --tags</code> hint in the publishing docs?
[14:29:02] <ajpiano> you should change that doc to markdown
[14:29:09] <ajpiano> and add a ``` bash block
[14:29:10] <ajpiano> :p
[14:36:38] <scott_gonzalez> jacobroufa: I plan to write a BitBucket service after we launch.
[14:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> The architecture supports it.
[14:36:54] <scott_gonzalez> And I made sure not to include GitHub specific features anywhere.

[14:37:00] <jacobroufa> ahh, cool
[14:37:50] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: is there an issue for it? we could link to it in the blog post
[14:38:22] <ajpiano> +1
[14:38:44] <scott_gonzalez> There is not, I can create one.
[14:38:48] <gnarf> lets
[14:38:49] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, there's sort of a ticket.
[14:38:58] <scott_gonzalez> One that I closed as "it's possible"
[14:38:59] <scott_gonzalez> :-P
[14:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/4
[14:40:25] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/tree/master/lib/service
[14:40:37] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: yea
[14:40:43] <ajpiano> i am already linking to the service directory
[14:41:09] <scott_gonzalez> The requirement is that the system can provide a unique account name and project name.
[14:41:17] <scott_gonzalez> And it can ping us when appropriate.
[14:41:33] <scott_gonzalez> I *think* that's all of the requirements.
[14:41:55] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to make it really flexible, but I don't anticipate supporting anything other than GitHub and BitBucket.
[14:42:29] <ajpiano> GOOGLE COE
[14:42:31] <ajpiano> CODE
[14:42:32] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[14:42:34] <ajpiano> SOURGECEFOGE
[14:43:29] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like GitHub has too many people already using it for Bitbucket to make a big splash in the general community.
[14:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> But I think it's possible if they keep improving.
[14:43:59] <scott_gonzalez> Especially if they can continue to offer unlimited private repos for free.
[14:44:32] <ajpiano> yea that's the big ticket

[14:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[14:47:26] <ajpiano> hahhaha
[14:47:31] <ajpiano> gnarf: you have to rename the file to md
[14:47:48] <ajpiano> though i guess that's what you meant by "bah sublime@!@#"
[14:47:49] <scott_gonzalez> He did, and then he re-added the html file

[14:47:57] <gnarf> yeah, i had left it open in sublime

[14:48:08] <ajpiano> that is sub lime
[14:49:03] <ajpiano> lol gnarf you coulda put those guys on separate lines :p
[14:49:19] <gnarf> ajpiano: shrug... what i did fixed it right? :)
[14:49:22] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Protip: Don't put titles on links.
[14:50:38] <gnarf> i like ajpiano's half markdown half html here
[14:50:39] <gnarf> :)
[14:51:09] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: where?
[14:51:19] <scott_gonzalez> It was in the opening paragraph.
[14:51:22] <ajpiano> gnarf: you can always add html to markdown
[14:51:31] <gnarf> ajpiano: yeah, but blog takes html
[14:51:32] <gnarf> so
[14:51:34] <ajpiano> if you need like, named anchors
[14:51:36] <scott_gonzalez> <a href="..." title="jQuery Plugin Registry">jQuery Plugin Registry</a>
[14:51:38] <gnarf> i converted for ya
[14:51:38] <gnarf> :)
[14:51:40] <ajpiano> i moved out of the clap you guys
[14:51:40] <ajpiano> :p
[14:51:45] <gnarf> ajpiano: oh
[14:51:46] <gnarf> damn
[14:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[14:52:05] <ajpiano> lol scott_gonzalez i clicked wordpress's little doo hickey
[14:52:05] <ajpiano> :p
[14:52:11] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[14:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> I should tell nacin then :-P
[14:53:11] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like I need Hackers playing in the background.
[14:53:22] <scott_gonzalez> How can I work on this without Razor and Blade?!?
[14:53:48] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: well, i asked :p
[14:53:50] <ajpiano> haha
[14:53:54] <ajpiano> i mean ,it asked, i answered
[14:54:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: You know zero cool plays sherlock in "Elementary"
[14:55:15] <scott_gonzalez> I haven't seen that.
[14:55:26] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: its pretty good :)
[14:56:00] <ajpiano> we should put the stuff about the grunt-init jqueryplugin in here somewhere
[14:56:05] <ajpiano> soon
[14:56:13] <ajpiano> so many worrrds
[14:56:14] <gnarf> we should make sure it works
[14:56:18] <scott_gonzalez> Not on netflix :-/
[14:56:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: nah, first season is still on live tv
[14:56:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I thought it was a movie.
[14:59:08] <ryanneufeld> do you guys commit the uglified js? or is that done on deploy?
[15:00:16] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: OMG, thank you! I've been trying to place his face, I knew I'd seen him in a movie before
[15:00:35] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: jquery does it in build process
[15:00:42] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: my plugins, i just commit the dist/ folder
[15:00:50] <gnarf> that way the zipball's have useful content in dist/
[15:00:53] <scott_gonzalez> Some people commit, some people don't.
[15:01:01] <scott_gonzalez> Ben likes to commit them.
[15:01:56] <scott_gonzalez> sooo...is there something I should be doing for plugins site right now, or can I switch to UI?
[15:02:21] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, gnarf: Does this look good? https://gist.github.com/529d9a50a326dfa63cd6
[15:02:32] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like the simplest way to prevent the race condition.
[15:02:44] <scott_gonzalez> It won't help with multiple wordpress-update scripts running at the same time.
[15:02:48] <scott_gonzalez> But it'll keep the plugins.db clean.
[15:02:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems fair
[15:03:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: well we only have one manager right now
[15:03:30] <gnarf> so i think i fixed the problem
[15:03:38] <scott_gonzalez> Let's hope so.
[15:03:57] <scott_gonzalez> As long as plugins.db stays clean, we can always restore WordPress.
[15:05:00] <gnarf> I still really want to announce this tonight, but its so late now...
[15:05:11] <gnarf> mainly cuz its sexy, and awesome to finally have this up
[15:07:04] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: heh, i caught that first episode, but I also probably watched Hackers like 100 times

[15:07:42] <ajpiano> i just need to do the contrib

[15:07:50] <ajpiano> setion of the post
[15:07:53] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[15:07:59] <ajpiano> and then we can release tonight if we want
[15:08:14] <ajpiano> i guess doing it at night would be nice, we'd only have to deal with the passionate after work crowd
[15:10:27] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: there's always the jquery.com frankenblog too
[15:10:29] <ajpiano> oh man
[15:10:33] <ajpiano> but i guess that's after ui
[15:10:41] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm still hoping to do UI tomorrow.
[15:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> I think jzaefferer bailed on the release dry run though.
[15:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> But kborchers is going to tackle the 1.9.0 update tonight.
[15:11:26] <gnarf> well i think today got me up to speed enough in most of the plugins code
[15:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> And I'll be working on the upgrade guide.
[15:11:45] <scott_gonzalez> And we got api.jqueryui.com/1.9/ live today.
[15:12:18] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: ajpiano yeah, i plan on doing that update tonight and hopefully a release dry run as well
[15:12:42] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: If you need me or have any questions and I don't respond to a ping, just give me a call.
[15:12:59] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: will do
[15:13:19] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: how late is too late as i tend to work until 1am CST or so :)
[15:13:39] <scott_gonzalez> Is that midnight or 11:00p EST?
[15:13:45] <kborchers> 2 am
[15:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[15:13:50] <scott_gonzalez> oh, right
[15:14:15] <scott_gonzalez> umm...that's fine
[15:14:30] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: you rang a few times?
[15:14:40] <kborchers> if i really need you i'll text first so you can ignore it easier if you're asleep :)
[15:15:01] <kborchers> i should be fine though
[15:15:06] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: I think most were probably just your name coming up, not an actual ping.
[15:15:11] <kborchers> ok, off for a bit
[15:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> But there is one thingthat sticks in my mind.
[15:15:22] <scott_gonzalez> If you have sites 1-19 installed.
[15:15:22] <nacin> "nacin: ping" from 8:53 this morning
[15:15:40] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, 8:53, You think I remember what I needed back then? :-P
[15:15:41] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I didn't realize he was Jordan Chase too! (Dexter)
[15:15:54] <nacin> you should always just ask, then I'll answer even when you're not around, and you won't forget
[15:16:07] <scott_gonzalez> I can't even scroll back that far, let me see if I can remember.
[15:16:09] <scott_gonzalez> But, first.
[15:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> you've got sites 1-19
[15:16:22] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: irc.jquery.com can scroll back that far :)
[15:16:22] <scott_gonzalez> And you try to visit site 21
[15:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> It will try to install 21 as 20 and things will blow up.
[15:16:45] <scott_gonzalez> How hard would it be to get it to install all missing sites when that happens?
[15:17:03] <ajpiano> hm
[15:17:15] <ajpiano> sucks that ben_alman is on vacay right when he'd want to register all his plugins
[15:18:03] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Oh, there was the date problem.
[15:18:32] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I can check it out

[15:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> That was just giving me no output.
[15:18:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: we need to tag plugins and wp-content right?
[15:19:00] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yup
[15:19:04] <gnarf> gonna do that quick
[15:19:16] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Use `npm version patch` for plugins.
[15:19:42] <gnarf> just do that and push?
[15:19:46] <gnarf> thats fn clever
[15:19:50] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[15:20:00] <gnarf> fuck
[15:20:05] <gnarf> i wasn't on master
[15:20:17] <scott_gonzalez> Aw crap, I just accidentally drag-deleted a channel from IRC.
[15:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> And I'm not sure what channel it was.
[15:20:59] <scott_gonzalez> Figured it out, it was #whatwg
[15:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> That is some bad design.

[15:23:22] <scott_gonzalez> The real question is did the manager pid stay the same while all other pids changed?
[15:23:29] <gnarf> yes
[15:23:33] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[15:23:43] <scott_gonzalez> I love how easy that was to write in node.

[15:26:42] <gnarf> oh shit
[15:26:49] <gnarf> the npm install happens after the grunt update
[15:26:50] <gnarf> fixing
[15:27:34] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: what client?
[15:27:47] <scott_gonzalez> Linkinus
[15:27:50] <ajpiano> haha
[15:27:57] <ajpiano> that and all the RAM huh
[15:28:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: The deps were already installed though.
[15:28:11] <scott_gonzalez> So while that change does need to happen, that's not what caused htis.
[15:28:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah it is
[15:29:06] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Well, Linkinus freaked out yesterday, so I had to restart. As a result it's only using ~400MB.
[15:29:11] <gnarf> it didn't have grunt-contrib-clean or whatever
[15:29:25] <ajpiano> lucky you
[15:29:28] <scott_gonzalez> Cleaning shouldn't matter.

[15:31:06] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, damn, I keep missing "stage" in things.

[15:38:39] <gnarf> trying to figure out why http://plugins.jquery.com/ajaxQueue/ doesn't have my gravatar for the author
[15:38:50] <scott_gonzalez> I noticed that earlier.
[15:39:34] <scott_gonzalez> The hashes are different.
[15:40:04] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: It's because you didn't list an email address.

[15:40:13] <gnarf> oh sigh
[15:40:30] <scott_gonzalez> It's the little things :-)
[15:44:38] <ajpiano> where is the canonical plugins.db kept
[15:45:23] <gnarf> in the root level of the plugins repo
[15:46:20] <ajpiano> no the like, one where all the real live people's plugins goes
[15:46:29] <ajpiano> not the one i get when i just start locally
[15:47:10] <gnarf>  /var/www/plugins.jquery.com/plugins.db on jq02.jquery.com
[15:47:36] <ajpiano> aha
[15:47:39] <gnarf> ajpiano: i need to set you up as a real user on these things yes?
[15:47:47] <ajpiano> not necessarily
[15:48:04] <ajpiano> i am just worried about documentating how to get local data in a plugins site
[15:48:21] <ajpiano> if someone were to try to work locally and wanted to test a style change etc
[15:48:24] <gnarf> cc scott_gonzalez
[15:48:27] <ajpiano> some one like per se me
[15:48:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez just posted a gist earlier today that will connect to the running manager and send a fake postreceive and you can point it at any plugin repo
[15:49:13] <ajpiano> yeah i have seen that gist
[15:49:18] <ajpiano> unless it's been revised
[15:51:06] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: We can create a copy of a plugins.db that has some data in it.
[15:51:06] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/0c1b6e763899853248aa
[15:51:17] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: that would be stellarrr
[15:51:59] <scott_gonzalez> Should we just put one in the repo?
[15:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, I wonder if I can write a script that would be faster.
[15:52:21] <scott_gonzalez> One that wouldn't require actually cloning the git repos.
[15:52:46] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Do we need this now or can I do it in a few days?
[15:52:51] <ajpiano> having plugins.db in the repo would also require it to be tracked in version control
[15:52:59] <ajpiano> and then it would diverge...?
[15:53:03] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: not immediately
[15:53:10] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Yeah, but I'm just talking about a small one that would have sample data.
[15:53:14] <scott_gonzalez> Not the real one that gets used.
[15:53:16] <ajpiano> ah,
[15:53:26] <ajpiano> so people would direct their config to that
[15:53:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll create an issue for this.
[15:53:33] <ajpiano> yeah, awesome
[15:53:52] <scott_gonzalez> I'm thinking that I might be able to create a grunt task that will populate some data.
[15:54:11] <gnarf> https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?q=search%20sourcetype%3D%22access_combined%22%20(status%3D404)%20host%3D%22plugins.jquery.com%22%20%7C%20top%20limit%3D10000%20uri&earliest=1358377200&latest=1358380800
[15:54:16] <scott_gonzalez> I have to look through and see if we use the checkouts for anything in the wordpress script.
[15:54:23] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like we might.
[15:54:33] <scott_gonzalez> Because the restore script reloads all the checkouts.
[15:56:11] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/69
[15:56:11] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, issue #69 by scottgonzalez (4m 50s ago): Create an easy way to populate a local plugins site for testing.
[16:01:35] <gnarf> https://splunk.jquery.com:8000/en-US/app/search/flashtimeline?q=search%20sourcetype%3D%22access_combined%22%20(status%3D200%20OR%20status%20%3D%20304)%20%22cache%3A0%2C0%22%20host%3D%22plugins.jquery.com%22&earliest=rt-1h&latest=rt
[16:01:44] <gnarf> those splunk urls are for you ajpiano / scott_gonzalez
[16:02:19] <ajpiano> i am completley unable to remember my damn splunk login, ever
[16:02:25] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, people like plugins.
[16:02:31] <scott_gonzalez> We should get the cookie plugin on there.
[16:02:51] <gnarf> did we ever curate a list of plugins we wanted on the site?
[16:02:58] <gnarf> I could go send some pulls to the repos
[16:03:08] <gnarf> with manifests
[16:03:15] <ajpiano> that would be good
[16:03:23] <ajpiano> it won't stop people from registering before
[16:03:25] <ajpiano> them
[16:03:39] <ajpiano> i kind of want to add a note discouraging landgrab behviour somewhere, i prob will
[16:08:30] <gnarf> ajpiano: your current draft of the blog up anywhere, or did you just go local with it
[16:14:31] <gnarf> so hey - mental note time.
[16:15:05] <gnarf> "Post that shit on facebook too" should like be on every announcement/blog agenda - cc scott_gonzalez DaveMethvin
[16:15:50] <gnarf> no post about 1.9 really
[16:16:38] <scott_gonzalez> Oh yeah, facebook. People use that, huh?
[16:16:56] <gnarf> :)
[16:17:03] <scott_gonzalez> I only open facebook in Opera after deleting all private data.
[16:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> I have no trust in that company.
[16:17:21] <gnarf> sure, but we should probably echo our announcements there
[16:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[16:17:27] <gnarf> so people can "like" them
[16:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> I don't even know how to do that.
[16:18:04] <scott_gonzalez> Just a status update or is there something more meaningful you can do in facebook?
[16:18:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: basically a copy of the tweet with a little more body is perfect
[16:19:20] <gnarf> but whatevs
[16:19:39] <scott_gonzalez> As a status update?
[16:20:07] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need the user/pass for our account.
[16:20:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: its not an account
[16:20:36] <scott_gonzalez> Heh
[16:20:40] <scott_gonzalez> Can you tell I don't use facebook?
[16:20:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: its a "page" - me, mike, leah, richard, and adam are all "admins"
[16:21:12] <gnarf> so any of us can post
[16:21:13] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, look at that!
[16:21:22] <scott_gonzalez> It even has that fancy new boxy background.
[16:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> And a lowres icon :-P
[16:23:59] <gnarf> but yeah, we should like setup a feed import from blog or something on there
[16:24:10] <gnarf> or just remember to post about it
[16:26:27] <gnarf> ajpiano: i can set you a new password on splunk
[16:26:44] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Going back to the version/date space issue...
[16:26:51] <ajpiano> gnarf: http://blog.jquery.com/?p=2440&preview=true&preview_id=2440&public=1&nonce=759fac6816
[16:26:55] <ajpiano> gnarf: yeah, can you do that
[16:27:05] <ajpiano> i will seriously remember this time
[16:27:13] <ajpiano> i just need to like, put a bow on it
[16:27:30] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like we can just push them onto 2 lines.
[16:28:07] <ajpiano> there's a million other caveats and things i could mention there but they make more sense in the site documentation
[16:29:11] <gnarf> ajpiano: you got some markdown in there still [Github] being one
[16:29:28] <ajpiano> uch, habits
[16:29:42] <scott_gonzalez> Something closer to http://cl.ly/image/260F2a0t0R1B
[16:30:04] <gnarf> ajpiano: re the "contributing" section
[16:30:32] <gnarf> is plugins all MIT?
[16:30:46] <gnarf> or is it the same licensed stuff as wp-content ?
[16:31:14] <ajpiano> it's same as wp-content
[16:31:17] <ajpiano> it's still "open source"
[16:32:00] <gnarf> true
[16:32:05] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/LICENSE.txt
[16:32:33] <gnarf> LGTM
[16:32:52] <ajpiano> gnarf: i just fwded you an e-mail, can you check if that's something you're able to do
[16:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> The MIT license only applies to the JS code in the plugins.jquery.com repo.
[16:33:11] <scott_gonzalez> Basically the lib and scripts directories.
[16:33:24] <ajpiano> and the pages directory........
[16:33:33] <ajpiano> and the tests, i assume :p
[16:33:34] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, and the pages direcotry.
[16:33:37] <scott_gonzalez> And the tests.
[16:33:38] <ajpiano> so basically, everything
[16:33:38] <ajpiano> :p
[16:33:39] <scott_gonzalez> Whatever :-P
[16:33:48] <ajpiano> THE JSHINTRC IS PROPRIETARY
[16:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> All of the templates and stuff are GPL though.
[16:34:02] <ajpiano> yah, but diff repos
[16:34:04] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[16:34:28] * scott_gonzalez starts reading the blog post
[16:34:37] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: are we ever gonna support like, things that don't go to public repos?
[16:35:04] <ajpiano> like with paid licenses, etc
[16:35:07] <ajpiano> e.g. http://www.jqwidgets.com/
[16:35:37] <scott_gonzalez> maybe?
[16:35:57] <scott_gonzalez> I think they'd need to write the code for it though :-P
[16:36:14] <gnarf> ajpiano: ya know, I'm not really sure there - danheberden handles most of our dns registration/registrar stuff
[16:36:25] <ajpiano> yah ok i'll fwd to him
[16:36:29] <ajpiano> heh, ok
[16:37:03] <gnarf> and I don't like see a "delete" or even a listing for visualjquery.com in the mediatemple control panel
[16:37:14] <ajpiano> don't sweat it
[16:38:00] <gnarf> wasn't 
[16:38:08] <scott_gonzalez> That’s it &emdash;
[16:38:27] <gnarf> &mdash;
[16:39:29] <ajpiano> #shitialwaysdorightthere
[16:39:34] <scott_gonzalez> looks good
[16:40:03] <ajpiano> just wrapping up these cheeses on my desk
[16:40:10] <ajpiano> then i'll put a conclusion on
[16:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> The trouble with em 'n en
[16:40:23] <ajpiano> but i have some cheese here that's been out for too long
[16:40:29] <gnarf> Conclusion - FINALLY!@$#@%#!#$^!$#%
[16:40:32] <scott_gonzalez> The cheese is old and moldy.
[16:41:18] <scott_gonzalez> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZA1DuB8NIE
[16:41:50] <ajpiano> hahaha
[16:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Do you know Sean Nesbitt and Jenn Grauer?
[16:43:47] <ajpiano> hm, grauer sounds familiar
[16:44:33] <ajpiano> but i don't think so
[16:44:39] <scott_gonzalez> One day Sean was trying to remember that phrase and he couldn't remember the word for moldy.
[16:45:00] <scott_gonzalez> And for whatever reason, it wasn't in our Spanish/English dictionary.
[16:45:16] <scott_gonzalez> So I asked Jenn how to say moldy (she speaks fluent Spanish), and she didn't know.
[16:45:34] <scott_gonzalez> So I was like "How do you not know? What if you needed to say 'The cheese is old and moldy'?"
[16:45:46] <scott_gonzalez> And she looked at my like I was crazy and said "The cheese is old, throw it out."
[16:46:15] <gnarf> lolz
[16:46:24] <scott_gonzalez> And completely unrelated, she is now a singer: http://www.jenngrauer.com/
[16:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oy boy, this looks like it's not going to be easy to track down.
[16:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> TypeError: Cannot read property '' of undefined
[16:50:39] <scott_gonzalez>     at Object.inline.lexer
[16:50:53] <scott_gonzalez> error in the markdown I'm writing :-(
[16:51:46] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, huh, it must not like the Trac report dump at the bottom :-P
[16:55:10] <ajpiano> hahha
[16:55:16] <ajpiano> ah i was wondering they were one in the same
[17:00:19] <gnarf> is this a bad thing: http://cl.ly/image/3T3B1x253W33
[17:01:54] <scott_gonzalez> well, it's not great
[17:32:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: how do you feel about a plugins by author page?
[17:34:06] <scott_gonzalez> It's something rworth wants.
[17:34:12] <scott_gonzalez> But what is the key?
[17:34:44] <gnarf> yeah
[17:35:20] <scott_gonzalez> Richard was thinking that we could tie authors to the upcoming jQuery Foundation user accounts.
[17:35:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not entirely sure how that would work though.
[17:40:22] <gnarf> url 
[17:40:25] <gnarf> point to the profile on jquery
[17:40:27] <gnarf> ?
[17:46:19] <gnarf> ajpiano: like the BBQ example
[17:46:29] <gnarf> but i wonder if it wont just make some trolls do it on purpose :)
[17:46:38] <ajpiano> gnarf: anyone who does it on purpose
[17:46:49] <ajpiano> deserves exactly what they'll get
[17:47:03] * gnarf does it on purpose
[17:47:05] <gnarf> ;)
[17:49:16] <ajpiano> ok
[17:49:17] <ajpiano> http://blog.jquery.com/?p=2440&preview=true&preview_id=2440&public=1&nonce=759fac6816
[17:49:20] <ajpiano> that's about it
[17:49:36] <gnarf> +1
[17:50:15] <scott_gonzalez> +1
[17:50:30] <ajpiano> should i just like
[17:50:34] <ajpiano> go live with the plugins site then
[17:50:36] <ajpiano> this is so momentous
[17:50:45] <ajpiano> i mean it is live
[17:50:48] <ajpiano> but should we tell everyone about it
[17:50:52] <ajpiano> i guess so
[17:51:24] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: rworth the trigger is about to be pulled, the hounds to be released, the flood to breach the levees
[17:51:24] <ajpiano> etc
[17:51:51] <DaveMethvin> ajpiano: DO IT
[17:52:28] <DaveMethvin> on second thought, let's wait a week
[17:52:31] <DaveMethvin> hahha
[17:52:33] <ajpiano> lol
[17:52:37] <scott_gonzalez> I can't wait for this thing to crash at 4:00a and be down when people across the ocean wake up and hear the news.
[17:52:39] <ajpiano> you said that the second after i presed publish
[17:52:43] <ajpiano> hhahaha
[17:52:57] <DaveMethvin> looks live to me
[17:53:33] <ajpiano> i still have a few things to push before tweeting
[17:53:36] <ajpiano> gotta update the readme
[17:53:59] <DaveMethvin> oh but the button should be a slightly different color and the margins are off by a half-pixel :D
[17:56:25] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i'm gonna add similar language about not being an asshole
[17:56:27] <ajpiano> to the names page
[17:56:31] <ajpiano> unless you don't think it should be there
[17:56:48] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Let me dig up an email from isaacs.
[17:57:00] <ajpiano> ok?
[17:57:08] <gnarf> forward it to plugins@ ? :)
[17:57:17] <ajpiano> yea, we should make sure plugins@jquery.com works
[17:57:20] <ajpiano> and that.... we are getting it
[17:57:27] <ajpiano> gnarf: it forwards to me, right?
[17:57:37] <gnarf> you, me, scott, richard
[17:57:42] <ajpiano> great
[17:57:47] <gnarf> its a "group"
[17:57:54] <gnarf> and all 4 of us are owners
[17:58:00] <ajpiano> we should have it forward to anyone who is OR EVER HAS BEEN in charge of this project
[17:58:09] <scott_gonzalez> https://gist.github.com/3b76b9bc69cb5eebb17e
[17:58:13] <ajpiano> ralph...boaz...jd....
[17:59:18] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: this is great
[17:59:27] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i'm more worried about in the short term
[17:59:35] <ajpiano> well i guess this sort of covers that
[17:59:50] <ajpiano> but even if someone comes up with an amazing plugin called "Nivo Slider" that is a functioning slider
[17:59:52] <ajpiano> in the next 24 hours
[18:00:03] <ajpiano> i still don't think they should get the name "nivo-slider"
[18:00:06] <ajpiano> cause that's just wack
[18:00:35] <ajpiano> i may take the TLDR from this though
[18:01:38] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/isaacs/npm/commit/993abe412db791f9460932371b39642817523aab
[18:01:39] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, isaacs (1mon 2d ago): doc: Clarify 'squatting' in disputes doc
[18:01:53] <scott_gonzalez> Might be worth reading through that disputes doc.
[18:03:37] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: You might like the last sentence too: "But npm is not for owning words. It's for sharing code. Hack or get out of the way."
[18:03:55] <ajpiano> yeah, i was just looking at that
[18:05:15] <ajpiano> we'll probably need to add a similar doc soonish

[18:36:21] <ajpiano> i'll be back on in a bit to see.... what is happenign
[18:36:24] <ajpiano> and keep working on other things :)
[18:36:27] <ajpiano> but hoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooray guys
[18:37:14] <DaveMethvin> "I just wanted to say good luck, we're all counting on you."
[18:37:44] <DaveMethvin> I kinda miss the Under Construction guy
[18:38:40] <gnarf> so does this mean we can add plugins back to the header links?
[18:38:40] <ajpiano> yeah
[18:38:45] <ajpiano> we were hotlinking that the whole time
[18:38:48] <ajpiano> gnarf: yeah, we should
[18:38:50] <ajpiano> i meant to but forgot
[18:38:57] <ajpiano> ok but seriously need to get off the comp for a tiny lil bit
[18:39:11] <DaveMethvin> go relax ajpiano, have a drink
[18:39:20] <DaveMethvin> you EEEEAAAAARNED it
[18:47:40] <gnarf> heh
[18:47:40] <gnarf> http://twitter.com/JameyLaroche/status/291735312026189824
[18:47:41] <b-ot> gnarf, @JameyLaroche: OMG OMG!!! @jquery Plugin registry is finally up and running!
[19:09:34] <gnarf> http://twitter.com/iluvatar_eru/status/291742979360690176 
[19:09:34] <b-ot> gnarf, @iluvatar_eru: @jquery Does your plugin publisher work for the moment ? I tried to publish mine, but it seems to fail every time
[19:09:39] <gnarf> i replied
[19:13:35] <Iluvatar> Hi there
[19:13:40] <gnarf> hey
[19:13:50] <Iluvatar> gnarf: I'm the guy on twitter
[19:13:51] <gnarf> Iluvatar: which repo are you working on?
[19:14:12] <gnarf> or which publisher are you talking about
[19:14:15] <Iluvatar> I try to publish https://github.com/Tillid/tiSlideshow
[19:14:50] <gnarf> okay, on https://github.com/Tillid/tiSlideshow/admin/hooks - you have http://plugins.jquery.com/postreceive-hook ?
[19:14:58] <Iluvatar> yes
[19:15:50] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, manifest copied from color plugin.
[19:16:06] <Iluvatar> yeah, copied from the example
[19:16:23] <Iluvatar> and because I don't have a MIT license file, I kept the same
[19:16:58] <Iluvatar> Do you think that's why it doesn't work ?
[19:17:09] <scott_gonzalez> no
[19:17:22] <scott_gonzalez> Just thought it was funny that you linked to another repo for the license.
[19:17:41] <gnarf> Iluvatar: can you hit the "test hook" on that hooks page?
[19:18:05] <Iluvatar> I pushed it many times, but it doesn't seem to do anything
[19:18:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so it's definitely receiving a post-commit
[19:18:54] <Iluvatar> In fact it does something (network listener on Chrome), and the request return 200
[19:19:00] <gnarf> just saw the packets come in
[19:19:15] <gnarf> no log entries tho
[19:20:00] <gnarf> Iluvatar: thanks for stopping in IRC btw :)
[19:20:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: any chance we can get at least one log entry per postreceive received?
[19:20:26] <Iluvatar> I thought of a bug because the last published plugin is yours gnarf, 14 hours ago
[19:20:45] <gnarf> Iluvatar: thats actually 6 hours ago, the time is off by 8 hours at the moment ;)
[19:21:15] <Iluvatar> ok, but isn't it too long for all jquery developers ?
[19:21:44] <gnarf> Iluvatar: we literally just announced this site, i published mine as tests before we did
[19:22:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you want it to log the payload?
[19:22:18] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: seems like thats too big, maybe just even the repo
[19:22:33] <gnarf> but like, what i'm missing right now is what happens to this guys request
[19:22:37] <gnarf> should I debug, or do you want to?
[19:22:57] <gnarf> you can prolly figure it out local faster than i can get my environment
[19:23:31] <scott_gonzalez> Sure, I can log the repo idj.
[19:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> Why is this showing so few lines? `tail -n 100 /var/log/syslog`
[19:26:24] <scott_gonzalez> What is this? Jan 16 18:55:09 nc02 syslogd 1.5.0#6: restart.
[19:26:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: syslog rotated
[19:26:41] <gnarf> look at .0
[19:26:47] <gnarf> its also in messages
[19:26:49] <gnarf> not syslog
[19:27:21] <scott_gonzalez> I thought earlier I was looking at messages and you said to look at syslog
[19:27:38] <gnarf> other way around
[19:29:09] <gnarf> Iluvatar: so its not even parsing your manifest for some reason... still looking into this
[19:29:26] <Iluvatar> ok ok
[19:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Which tag are you looking at right now?
[19:29:34] <scott_gonzalez> One of them had broken JSON.
[19:29:50] <Iluvatar> (I'm adding my own license, sorry for some hook)
[19:30:21] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i was looking at https://github.com/Tillid/tiSlideshow/blob/v1.0.0/tiSlideshow.jquery.json
[19:31:02] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that's the broken one.
[19:31:09] <scott_gonzalez> Notice the lack of comma on line 14
[19:31:19] <Iluvatar> Hmm, by the way, I create v1.0.0 tags and 1.0.0, are they chosen by alphabetical order ?
[19:31:26] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: might wanna have a log message for "Not in JSON format" 
[19:31:44] <gnarf> Iluvatar: ^^^ 
[19:32:14] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[19:32:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Can you put together a list of the things you want logged?
[19:32:33] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[19:32:36] <gnarf> issue coming up
[19:35:43] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/72
[19:36:00] <gnarf> Iluvatar: 1.0.0 and v1.0.0 are basically the same, you shouldn't use both
[19:36:27] <gnarf> you can git tags -d 1.0.0 ; git push origin :1.0.0 to delete one
[19:36:35] <Iluvatar> yeah, in fact I tried 1.0.0 because v1.0.0 didn't work and I didn't see why
[19:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, I'll get that in.
[19:36:46] <Iluvatar> Already done, only 1.0.0 left
[19:37:12] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Having different tag names like that is a good way to re-attempt posting though.
[19:37:20] <Iluvatar> Hmm, should I try to push something else, or only try to "test button" on the hooks page ?
[19:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> Without having to add a build number to your version.
[19:37:22] <gnarf> yeah
[19:37:37] <gnarf> Iluvatar: you need to fix your json file
[19:37:42] <gnarf> its missing a comma on line 14
[19:38:05] <Iluvatar> https://github.com/Tillid/tiSlideshow/blob/1.0.0/tislideshow.jquery.json
[19:38:36] <Iluvatar> (I only kept 1.0.0, not v1.0.0, because I already corrected the file)
[19:38:48] <Iluvatar> The file seems to be good this time ?
[19:39:12] <kswedberg>  ajpiano yt?
[19:40:04] <gnarf> Iluvatar: I would suggest just bumping to 1.0.1 and pushing it
[19:40:15] <Iluvatar> ok, I'm trying
[19:40:40] <jqcommit> 01[13contribute.jquery.org01] 15kswedberg pushed 2 new commits to 06master: 02http://git.io/8FSdfQ
[19:40:40] <jqcommit> 13contribute.jquery.org/06master 144e7d343 15Karl Swedberg: Fix a couple typos in web-sites.md
[19:40:40] <jqcommit> 13contribute.jquery.org/06master 14340dc6d 15Karl Swedberg: Start work on documentation page
[19:40:56] <gnarf> Iluvatar: it already tried to parse your 1.0.0 tag
[19:40:59] <gnarf> so it isn't trying again
[19:41:04] <gnarf> even though you changed the SHA
[19:41:23] <Iluvatar> And it does not work ?
[19:45:01] <Iluvatar> Gnarf I shouldn't have understood what you tell me, do I have to change for a new version or wait until you tell me it works ?
[19:45:23] <gnarf> Iluvatar: jumping to 1.0.1 would be easiest
[19:46:36] <gnarf> ajpiano: http://plugins.jquery.com/noop/
[19:48:00] <stephband> Hello. I'm looking for help making the new plugins.jquery.com site register my plugin. I've followed all the steps, but my commits are not being picked up.
[19:48:39] <gnarf> stephband: https://github.com/stephband/jparallax/commit/9c14ffe2c74a84bdae38df16ba3bf105af80b1f2#commitcomment-2449892 ;)
[19:49:54] <stephband> Thanks. So we're forced to have a license? The licenses field is there, and is assigned an empty array.
[19:49:54] <Iluvatar> Well gnarf, I tried again. By the way what is the average time we should wait before the plugin to be published ?
[19:50:30] <gnarf> stephband: yes, license is required
[19:50:35] <gnarf> at least one
[19:50:40] <gnarf> otherwise, noone can use it :)
[19:51:03] <gnarf> Iluvatar: it should be almost immedate (~2 minutes tops)
[19:52:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: see anything wrong here? https://github.com/Tillid/tiSlideshow/blob/1.0.1/tislideshow.jquery.json
[19:52:08] <Iluvatar> Ok, my plugin must have fail again :(
[19:52:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: another no-messager
[19:52:17] <gnarf> :)
[19:52:44] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[19:53:09] <scott_gonzalez> I'll need to walk all the paths and see where it goes that we don't get any messages.
[19:53:27] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: sorry
[19:53:34] <scott_gonzalez> It's not your fault.
[19:53:38] <Iluvatar> I am sorry
[19:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to catch all the possible exit paths, but there's a lot of jumping around in the code.
[19:54:06] * gnarf nods
[19:54:18] <scott_gonzalez> Also, I was worried about dumping too much data in the logs.
[19:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> But I guess there's a reason people say "log everything, all the time."
[19:55:58] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/TurnWheel/jReject/blob/1.0.2/jreject.jquery.json is another no-messager
[19:57:23] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if it's case sensitive file names.
[19:57:36] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: "name" matches for Iluvatar's
[19:57:43] <gnarf> the jreject one definitely doesn't
[19:58:07] <scott_gonzalez> Well, no message means it wasn't an issue with the manifest.
[19:58:14] <Iluvatar> Maybe it's because of the upcase letter ?
[19:58:19] <scott_gonzalez> Because if there are errors with the manifest, it gets logged.
[19:58:42] <gnarf> stephband: Jan 16 19:57:21 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[15850]: Added parallax v2.0.3 to WordPress :)
[19:59:09] <gnarf> stephband: http://plugins.jquery.com/parallax/
[19:59:12] <gnarf> yay!
[19:59:13] <scott_gonzalez> Although, there is this check: if ( filename && filename.substr( 0, filename.length - 12 ) !== manifest.name ) {
[19:59:18] <stephband> @gnarf Thanks. It works, now.
[19:59:41] <scott_gonzalez> That should be case insensitive.
[19:59:46] <gnarf> agree
[20:01:34] <stephband> @gnarf …although I do think that you should be allowed to publish without a license.
[20:02:16] <scott_gonzalez> stephband: Why? Nobody knows if they're allowed to use your plugin then.
[20:02:44] <stephband> @gnarf Which is fine.
[20:03:11] <stephband> @gnarf Legalise should be opt-in, not obligatory.
[20:03:37] <gnarf> i have to agree with scott_gonzalez here
[20:03:44] <scott_gonzalez> No it shouldn't. This is not a place for you to say "Here is my code. You may not use it because there is no licensing."
[20:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> It's a place for people to share their code so other can use it. Licensing is a requirement for that to happen.
[20:04:21] <stephband> No, I want to say, "here is my code". No further statement required.
[20:04:38] <scott_gonzalez> That is not what the plugin registry is for.
[20:04:46] <stephband> Ok, fair enough.
[20:09:44] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: still kinda lost on what happened to jReject & tiSlideshow
[20:10:09] <scott_gonzalez> I think it's the capital letters.
[20:10:19] <scott_gonzalez> But I feel like it should've been logged then.
[20:10:30] <Iluvatar> I remove capital letters to tislideshow
[20:10:41] <Iluvatar> removed*
[20:19:39] <Iluvatar> well I have to go
[20:20:11] <Iluvatar> See you later
[20:22:37] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i'm nowhere trying to trace whats happening to this request
[20:22:53] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[20:23:11] <scott_gonzalez> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/13214#comment:6
[20:25:18] <stephband> Hello again. I'm now trying register https://github.com/stephband/jquery.event.move … the manifest seems fine, but is it illegal to name it move.event.jquery.json ?
[20:28:45] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^^^ another no messager :(
[20:29:14] <gnarf> so stephband the "name" must be name.jquery.json 
[20:29:24] <gnarf> stephband: i would also suggest move-event
[20:29:36] <gnarf> because the "."s are used for "namespacing"
[20:30:00] <gnarf> or event-move
[20:30:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^^^ seem to make sense?
[20:31:01] <stephband> Yes, ok. It's nice to differentiate plugins from special events, and there does not seem to be a convention to do so. I thought the namespace 'event' was quite appropriate.
[20:31:12] <gnarf> stephband: sure
[20:31:15] <gnarf> so if its event.move
[20:31:31] <gnarf> you need "name": "event.move" and event.move.jquery.json
[20:31:59] <stephband> Oh, I see! "name" has to match name of the file. Gotcha! marci :)
[20:32:03] <gnarf> stephband: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/1.9.2/ui.effect.jquery.json
[20:32:31] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Yeah, makes sense.
[20:32:41] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you working on code for any of this atm?
[20:33:40] <scott_gonzalez> Nope.
[20:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> Been working on UI.
[20:38:34] <stephband> @gnarf Any other tips? I renamed the package file, but it still isn't showing up.
[20:41:03] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/stephband/jquery.event.move/blob/1.3.4/event.move.jquery.json is another no-messager
[20:41:05] <gnarf> :)
[20:42:29] <scott_gonzalez> Invalid JSON
[20:42:35] <gnarf> damnit
[20:42:36] <scott_gonzalez> license[0].url isn't quoted.
[20:42:50] <gnarf> why don't i see these things :(
[20:43:15] <scott_gonzalez> I dunno. GitHub even highlights it for you :-P
[20:43:26] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: that kinda day lol
[20:43:32] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[20:43:37] <gnarf> stephband: its invalid json :)
[20:43:57] <scott_gonzalez> It's been a loong work day.
[20:44:00] <stephband> Yup. Got it. Why don't I see these things. Thanks, you guys :)
[20:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> s/day/week/ :-)
[20:44:35] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: aye
[20:44:47] <gnarf> stephband: trying to keep an eye on this
[20:46:20] <stephband> Yay! http://plugins.jquery.com/event.move/
[20:46:21] <gnarf> stephband: Jan 16 20:45:53 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[15850]: Added event.move v1.3.5 to WordPress
[20:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...bad styling if there's no description for a plugin.
[20:48:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: already issued it
[20:48:24] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i figured that was the least of our problems :)
[20:49:18] <stephband> I think your using a non-localised clock to generate the "released … ago" text. I'm in Switzerland and the plugin I just published says "Released 8 hours ago".
[20:49:45] <gnarf> stephband: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/75 ;)
[20:50:49] <stephband> @gnarf. Cheers!
[20:53:04] <mvs> I made a bit of a stupid mistake... I pushed a tag with the a manifest file that was incorrect (incorrect email address... oops!)... I tried deleting the tag and pushing a new tag with the corrected data, yet plugins.jquery.com doesn't seem to be updating... will it eventually, or do I need to push a brand new version?
[20:53:25] <gnarf> mvs: new version
[20:53:48] <mvs> d'oh, ok, thank you very much :-)
[20:54:04] <mvs> and thanks to all involved in plugins.jquery.com! It's pretty cool!
[20:54:20] <gnarf> mvs: thank scott_gonzalez a bunch, ;)
[20:54:57] <mvs> thank you thank you thank you scott_gonzalez!!
[20:55:05] <ajpiano> hey guys
[20:55:06] <scott_gonzalez> You're welcome mvs.
[20:55:13] <gnarf> mvs: which plugin? :)
[20:55:22] <ajpiano> is the forth still....holdin it down
[20:55:34] <scott_gonzalez> Mostly.
[20:55:55] <scott_gonzalez> No crashes or anything, but the lack of communication back the user is really tough.
[20:55:57] <ajpiano> hey look three plugins
[20:56:06] <ajpiano> yeah, reading back through the scrollback, that seems really ... bad
[20:56:20] <gnarf> ajpiano: which?
[20:56:33] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if we can get UI out in the morning, then I'll have the rest of the day to work on this.
[20:56:34] <gnarf> oh communication
[20:56:35] <gnarf> lol
[20:56:37] <ajpiano> gnarf: the fact that they get no feedback
[20:56:39] <gnarf> i didn't read 3 lines before
[20:56:41] <gnarf> :)
[20:56:45] <ajpiano> heh
[20:56:56] <ajpiano> alright, yeah, at least we're here to help people who are trying to early adopt :)
[20:57:04] <scott_gonzalez> Although I guess I need to work on the blog at some point tomorrow.
[20:57:25] <gnarf> I really like the commit comment by @jquerybot theory of feedback
[20:57:26] <ajpiano> yeah :/
[20:57:45] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[20:57:49] <ajpiano> what commit would it comment on
[20:57:53] <ajpiano> i'm generally in favour of that as well
[20:57:54] <gnarf> ajpiano: the tag
[20:57:56] <scott_gonzalez> The tag commit.
[20:58:01] <ajpiano> ok
[20:58:08] <ajpiano> would that work on non github :p
[20:58:21] <gnarf> maybe not
[20:58:57] <mvs> gnarf: guards
[20:59:00] <gnarf> but we'd have a "reply()" method or something that could even send email
[20:59:06] <gnarf> mvs: add a description too :)
[20:59:17] <ajpiano> i feel lilke e-mail wouldn't be spammy, people *want* to know what happened
[20:59:18] <mvs> I did :-) not much of one, but a start...
[20:59:27] <ajpiano> if e-mails the way we can confirm or deny that it worked, so be it
[20:59:36] <gnarf> mvs: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/74 :)
[20:59:56] <gnarf> ajpiano: commit comment would = email too
[21:00:00] <gnarf> at least for github
[21:00:06] <ajpiano> right
[21:00:08] <gnarf> but email would be a nice backup
[21:00:13] <gnarf> or general solution
[21:00:25] <mvs> heh, yeah, I saw that, wondered if it was lack of description
[21:01:57] <mvs> Hmmm.... I wonder if I screwed things up somehow... my new version push still hasn't been captured... is there a bit of a delay on updates?
[21:02:05] <gnarf> stephband: Manifest errors: github/stephband/jquery.event.swipe 0.5.0 [ 'Manifest version (0.5) is invalid.' ]
[21:02:22] <gnarf> ajpiano: there is always the "manual method"
[21:02:23] <gnarf> :)
[21:02:27] <ajpiano> haha
[21:02:34] <mvs> (or maybe I screwed things up by deleting the bad tag....)
[21:03:00] <gnarf> mvs: did you try to push the same version #?
[21:03:07] <gnarf> you need to push a new version #
[21:03:28] <gnarf> i messed up my "keywords" on ajaxQueue :)
[21:03:48] <gnarf> http://plugins.jquery.com/ajaxQueue/0.1.0/ :)
[21:04:15] <mvs> So... here's what I did in this order... deleted the first bad version (0.6.0), pushed the same version again to a new commit... deleted that version, added a new version (0.6.1) to the same commit hash as the second push of 0.6.0
[21:05:11] <gnarf> mvs: https://github.com/on-site/guards.js/blob/0.6.1/guards.jquery.json still version 0.6.0 in the manifest :)
[21:05:15] <gnarf> you'll need an 0.6.2
[21:05:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^^^ that was a "no-messager"
[21:06:09] <ajpiano> gnarf: what is a "no messager"
[21:06:55] <gnarf> Invalid JSON
[21:06:55] <gnarf> Package Version / Tag Mismatch
[21:06:55] <gnarf> Package Name / Manifest Name Mismatch
[21:07:01] <gnarf> these things don't log anything
[21:07:02] <mvs> gnarf: d'oh! Thanks a bunch!
[21:07:25] <gnarf> hence "no message"
[21:08:07] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Seems like there should've been an invalid manifest error for that.
[21:08:14] <ajpiano> ah
[21:08:16] <scott_gonzalez> The tag is 0.6.1, but version is 0.6.0
[21:08:19] <stephband> Thanks for your help, guys. Well done on the new site. G'night!
[21:08:30] <ajpiano> stephband: welcome - thanks for early adoptin' :)
[21:09:13] <gnarf> huh
[21:09:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: plugins.jquery.com[15849]: Manifest errors: github/on-site/guards.js 0.6.1 [ 'Manifest version (0.6.0) does not match tag (0.6.1).' ]
[21:09:18] <gnarf> just now showed up
[21:09:24] <gnarf> but it was sittin there for a while...
[21:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> syslog is async, right?
[21:09:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah, but not THAT async
[21:10:08] <gnarf> i mean, that tag was there for a while
[21:10:12] <mvs> ok, pushed a hopefully correct 0.6.2... *crosses fingers*
[21:10:48] <mvs> maybe it was a bad idea to rush out a manifest and whatnot to make sure to grab the name for the plugin...
[21:11:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: maybe github hooks are just being slow?
[21:12:11] <gnarf> because it hasn't even detected his 0.6.2 yet
[21:12:29] <scott_gonzalez> could be
[21:12:40] <mvs> gnarf: the first one was reasonably fast, for what it's worth
[21:12:57] <gnarf> mvs: yeah - try going to /admin/hooks on your repo and hitting "test hook"
[21:13:48] <gnarf> there
[21:13:53] <mvs> pressed it
[21:14:02] <mvs> \o/
[21:14:10] <gnarf> http://plugins.jquery.com/guards/ has 0.6.2
[21:14:24] <ajpiano> hey pifantastic
[21:14:29] <mvs> thanks so much for the help!
[21:14:34] <pifantastic> ajpiano: sup
[21:14:46] <ajpiano> mvs:  don't worry, it's all good, we are happy to have people kicking the tires
[21:14:58] <ajpiano> pifantastic: as you may have noticed there is a functioning plugin site
[21:15:11] <pifantastic> ajpiano: soooo sexy
[21:15:15] <ajpiano> wooo
[21:15:36] <mvs> now time to update my packaging script to make sure I don't mess up the versions again...
[21:15:43] <ajpiano> we are noticing right now that we have pretty unsatisfactory reporting of errors to users
[21:15:46] <ajpiano> after submission though
[21:15:48] <scott_gonzalez> So nice to see this working.
[21:16:00] <scott_gonzalez> Hmm..just found a bug. The New Plugins column is showing updated plugins, not new plugins.
[21:16:09] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/11
[21:16:14] <gnarf> ajpiano: but gnarf has an awesome ability to go comment on peoples commits :)
[21:16:27] <ajpiano> pifantastic: seems like the type of thing that might be up your alley
[21:16:34] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i really want a http://plugins.jquery.com/tags/ :)
[21:16:37] <ajpiano> if you were feelin IN THE MOOD
[21:17:03] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: File an issue. I'm sure we can put that together pretty easily.
[21:17:31] <pifantastic> ajpiano: mmhmmmm, yeah, I'd be happy to hop in there. It will probably have to wait until tomorrow though. Is this an ASAP thing? Or just a next few days thing?
[21:17:54] <ajpiano> it's sort of an ASAP thing but ASAP might be the next few days
[21:17:59] <ajpiano> cause we've got a lot on the ole docket
[21:18:14] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/77
[21:18:21] <pifantastic> ajpiano: cool cool. I will do my best to get cracking on it soon
[21:18:33] <ajpiano> cool, ping us if you need halpman
[21:18:45] <ajpiano> and if anything starts happening we shall do likewise
[21:19:19] <mvs> just want to double check, but did I miss an important email by having my first tag have the wrong email address...?
[21:19:28] <ajpiano> mvs: no
[21:19:32] <mvs> *phew*
[21:19:48] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: more logging: http://cl.ly/image/0R2C2l2Z2e3a
[21:20:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: Discovered tag _____ ?
[21:20:27] <gnarf> easy one?
[21:20:46] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: I think so.
[21:21:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: can you feed some of the no-messagers into your tester and see if we get a log for em?
[21:21:59] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Do you want me to list all tags or just unprocessed so far?
[21:22:14] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i would say anything heading to processing
[21:22:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so that way if we ever get updating sha's it logs again?
[21:23:16] <gnarf> Processing: <%= repo %> <%= tag %>
[21:23:52] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[21:24:14] <gnarf> Found Manifest: <%= repo %> <%= tag %> <%= manifest.json %>
[21:24:35] <gnarf> (if any of these aren't easy, kick em to tomorrow)
[21:25:01] <gnarf> plugins.jquery.com[15850]: Added maskedinput v1.3.1 to WordPress
[21:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/17210u0d3N0v
[21:25:23] <ajpiano> kswedberg: if you're still around.... the documentation stuff looks great!
[21:25:34] <scott_gonzalez> You want me to log the whole manifest?
[21:25:50] <ajpiano> thanks :)
[21:25:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: no, just the filename
[21:25:57] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[21:26:06] <gnarf> could be useful
[21:26:25] <gnarf> like "oh, found this manifest but no further log... *raise brow*"
[21:26:33] <gnarf> :)
[21:26:48] <gnarf> or actually the lack of that message is more telling
[21:26:51] <gnarf> no *.jquery.json file
[21:28:46] <gnarf> stephband: on a ROLL!
[21:28:49] <gnarf> :)
[21:29:34] <stephband> Yeehaa!
[21:31:30] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: http://cl.ly/image/0N3s2M0l3W3K
[21:32:01] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: nice
[21:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, what are some of the no message repos?
[21:32:39] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: Manifest Errors might wanna add the manifest filename too
[21:32:54] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/Tillid/tiSlideshow
[21:33:25] <gnarf> https://github.com/stephband/jquery.event.move had one (name mismatch i think...)
[21:34:11] <gnarf> https://github.com/TurnWheel/jReject
[21:34:30] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1x2U1V1U0A1o
[21:35:39] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: strange, your's added tislideshow?
[21:35:59] <gnarf> that one hasn't landed yet
[21:36:04] <gnarf> on the live site
[21:36:07] <scott_gonzalez> event.move and jReject: http://cl.ly/image/1x0t0O3Y1T1E
[21:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Any other logging to add now?
[21:36:57] <gnarf> so we know 1.3.3 and 1.3.4 failed mysteriously for event.move ;) 
[21:37:17] <gnarf> and 1.3.2
[21:37:24] <gnarf> is that the invalid json one?
[21:38:19] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...I guess there's more debugging to do :-)
[21:38:31] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: in that case, give me what you got
[21:38:32] <gnarf> :)
[21:39:52] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[21:40:40] <gnarf> http://open.spotify.com/track/1rIxqd83G5QIj3A7McdaYv is what comes into my head when i think about you adding all this shit right now ;)
[21:41:00] <jqcommit> 01[13plugins.jquery.com01] 15scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/2Ex4vQ

[21:41:56] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Now I'm going to have Green Day stuck in my head.
[21:42:01] <ajpiano> hahaha
[21:42:12] <ajpiano> i saw the first few words of that subject in my email and i was like
[21:42:14] <ajpiano> ..........
[21:42:21] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: No spotify for me.
[21:42:44] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you can use Spotify without facebook now?
[21:42:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: yeah
[21:43:31] <gnarf> ajpiano scott_gonzalez: I missed something?
[21:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> core ticket
[21:43:57] <ajpiano> jqbug.com/13242
[21:44:29] <gnarf> wtf
[21:44:35] <gnarf> lol
[21:44:48] <gnarf> dbr!
[21:44:48] <gnarf> Due to that Toe Nail Fungus therapy has got enormous hoopla.
[21:45:57] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Want me to tag plugins?
[21:46:06] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: couldn't hurt right? :)
[21:47:13] <scott_gonzalez> Ohh...ajpiano broke it.
[21:47:26] <ajpiano> noway
[21:47:37] <ajpiano> i haven't even committed in like 4 hours
[21:47:38] <scott_gonzalez> You manually tagged.
[21:47:40] <jqcommit> 01[13plugins.jquery.com01] 15scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/oyCyVA
[21:47:40] <jqcommit> 13plugins.jquery.com/06master 145cb784f 15Scott González: 1.0.3
[21:47:53] <scott_gonzalez> Which made `npm version patch` blow up :-P
[21:47:57] <ajpiano> how should i have tagged
[21:47:58] <ajpiano> ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
[21:48:00] <ajpiano> i didn't realisee
[21:48:05] <scott_gonzalez> Not a big deal.
[21:48:13] <ajpiano> that we were doing plugins.jquery in npm stuff
[21:48:20] <scott_gonzalez> I just had to `git reset --hard HEAD^` and `npm version 1.0.3`
[21:48:30] <scott_gonzalez> We're not, but npm provides a nice way to release.
[21:48:35] <ajpiano> does that mean i'd have to be owner in order to tag future plugins releases ?
[21:48:42] <scott_gonzalez> It does a commit which updates package.json's version and creates a tag.
[21:48:46] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[21:48:51] <ajpiano> ahhh
[21:48:51] <ajpiano> ok
[21:49:03] <scott_gonzalez> So any project that has a package.json lets us do this.
[21:49:07] <ajpiano> right on right on
[21:49:12] <ajpiano> i am picking up what you are putting down
[21:49:13] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably add minimal package.jsons to projects that don't need them.
[21:49:16] <scott_gonzalez> Just to make tagging easier.
[21:49:33] <scott_gonzalez> That way you don't have to look through a massive list of tags to figure out the correct version to tag with.
[21:49:39] <scott_gonzalez> Just `npm version {whatever}`
[21:49:40] <ajpiano> yeah
[21:49:46] <gnarf> they should all have em
[21:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> pathch | minor | major | specific version
[21:49:59] <gnarf> at least content repos
[21:50:05] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[21:50:13] <scott_gonzalez> we should do it for jquery-wp-content too.
[21:50:20] <scott_gonzalez> That one is actually the hardest because we tag so often.
[21:53:47] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: just a CC, all the logs for plugins are jq02 /var/log/messages 
[21:54:04] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: in case you want to help support someone in here, there might be some extra logging info there
[21:57:58] <scott_gonzalez> If I worked a normal job, my work week would be over already :-P
[21:58:07] <ajpiano> hahaha
[21:58:20] <ajpiano> i got in bed for a little bit
[21:58:29] <ajpiano> but then i thought about the e-mails i have to send to potential conf speakers
[21:58:36] <scott_gonzalez> oh boy
[21:58:39] <scott_gonzalez> speaking of confs...
[21:58:39] <ajpiano> and the email i have to write to the 365 days of jquery guy
[21:58:54] <ajpiano> so i got back up
[21:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still waiting to hear back about whether we're going to Toronto during the conf or just asfter.
[21:59:19] <ajpiano> yeah, i haven't had room in my brain to think about it in the last few days
[21:59:40] <ajpiano> i assume rworth is figuring it out
[21:59:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, he's waiting to hear back from the organizers.
[22:23:41] <gnarf> im gonna stay up til ~2am or so commenting on peoples repos if they fail submissions
[22:31:37] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: The problem with "jquery": "*" is that node-semver can't parse that into a standard range.
[22:31:47] <scott_gonzalez> npm must have special handling for that.
[22:32:15] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: so "*" should be allowed?
[22:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> We can add support for it, but I feel like not supporting it might make people think about it more.
[22:33:02] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine either way though.
[22:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/78
[22:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> Talking to my friend at Atlassian about getting someone to add support for Bitbucket :-)
[22:43:27] <ajpiano> that would be rad
[22:51:13] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: it doesn't seem to be detecting the 1.0.0 tag on https://github.com/mugifly/jquery-simple-datetimepicker/blob/1.0.0/simple-dtpicker.jquery.json ?
[22:51:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: *shrug*
[22:51:52] <gnarf> its not in repos, nor does it identify it in the log
[22:52:42] <scott_gonzalez> hmm....nothing in the log?
[22:53:44] <gnarf> now it picks it up

[23:09:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: http://twitter.com/andreypopp/status/291793274027528192 ;)
[23:10:13] * scott_gonzalez rolls eyes
[23:13:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, bed time.
[23:13:44] <ajpiano> gnarf: can you make it so stage.events.jquery.org points to jquery-wp-content land
[23:13:48] <ajpiano> gnight scott_gonzalez :)
[23:13:58] <gnarf> ajpiano: can you remind me tomorrow
[23:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> Good night ajpiano and gnarf. See you "tomorrow".
[23:14:30] <ajpiano> if you don't do it now, then yes i will certainly remind you about it tomorrow :p
[23:14:43] <ajpiano> i need to start getting that site ready
[23:14:43] <gnarf> ajpiano: yeah, not now
[23:14:47] <ajpiano> no prob
[23:14:54] <ajpiano> i'll def remind you tom
[23:21:56] <gnarf> well, our shit handles unicode: http://plugins.jquery.com/selection/
[23:21:57] <gnarf> :)
[23:24:51] <ajpiano> hahah rad
[23:40:35] <gnarf> ajpiano: the tab stops seem messy in the json here: http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/package-manifest/#field-licenses
[23:41:10] <gnarf> also, those headers a <a> links that seem broken...
[23:42:16] <ajpiano> yup
[23:42:47] <ajpiano> which links
[23:42:56] <gnarf> "Sample Manifest" for instance
[23:42:59] <ajpiano> the ones that are just named anchors for other things?
[23:43:04] <gnarf> you'd assume it was a link to named anchor
[23:43:13] <gnarf> but its a 404
[23:43:25] <gnarf> same with "X Version Ranges" above it
[23:43:36] <ajpiano> ah
[23:43:42] <ajpiano> that should be a name not an href
[23:44:16] <ajpiano> truth be told i want to add github-esque auto-anchor creation to headings
[23:44:22] <gnarf> :+1:
[23:44:26] <ajpiano> cause we souldn't have to manually write the html out
[23:44:29] <ajpiano> i'ev ben thinking about it for evs
[23:50:50] <gnarf> http://twitter.com/AurelioDeRosa/status/291812592635232256
[23:50:52] <gnarf> huh?
[23:51:05] <gnarf> i would imagine people would just keyword "moblie" :)
[23:51:34] <ajpiano> yea
[23:57:15] <gnarf> nice @remybach
[23:57:19] <gnarf> :)
