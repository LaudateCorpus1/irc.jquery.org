[12:53:26] <arthurvr> On the websites, if we add code (examples) should we make sure those use the latest updates of the JavaScript style guide or make sure the style is consistent on that specific page?
[12:53:42] <arthurvr> Sadly we donâ€™t have esformatter to update all code examples :(
[17:31:53] <arschmitz> arthurvr: in the projects at least we generally just make anything new follow the new guide and moving forward anything we touch gets updated.
