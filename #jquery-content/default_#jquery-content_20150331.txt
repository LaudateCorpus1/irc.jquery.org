[10:41:58] <Inferon> Hello to all.... I am new to IRC... I wanted to ask something about jQuery Learning Center... :)
[10:42:46] <arthurvr> Inferon: hey! Feel free to ask :)
[10:44:23] <Inferon> I am preparing the project proposal... I mentioned about my thoughts of the front end... Should I specify anything about the backend too...?
[10:50:40] <arthurvr> Inferon: hmm the deadline was past friday isnâ€™t it?
[10:51:08] <Inferon> The deadline was past friday...?!
[10:51:30] <Inferon> I thought I had time during community bonding phase...
[10:51:54] <sfrisk> The deadline to submit your proposal was last Friday
[10:52:31] <sfrisk> If you're already submitted your proposal, your potential mentor may allow you to edit your proposal, but if you haven't submitted a proposal yet, you can't anymore
[10:52:47] <Inferon> Ok...
[10:53:50] <sfrisk> https://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2015
[10:54:40] <Inferon> Is there anything I can do now...?!!
[10:55:00] <arschmitz> Inferon: you are still welcome to contirubte
[10:55:05] <arschmitz> you just cant do GSoC
[10:55:16] <Inferon> Oh... ok sir...
[11:11:41] <sigorilla> Hi! How will you evaluate the proposals? Each mentor will rate? And after that, the proposal with the best rating will be selected. Right? Or will it be decided in another way?
[11:17:03] <sigorilla> And how many mentors will be involved in the selection of participants?
[11:29:38] <arschmitz> sigorilla: we are evaluating them on several basis
[11:30:02] <arschmitz> sigorilla: it will be decided mostly by the mentors listed for that task but there will be input from others
[11:42:06] <sigorilla> arschmitz, thank you :)
