[00:15:19] <defaude> hello, world (of jQuery)
[03:24:39] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: started drafting the QUnit release blog post: https://gist.github.com/cc5c70a9d44c921f7998 - also, I can't tell if I have an account on blog.jquery.com, can you check?
[04:30:05] <jaujau> the new jquery plugins site is great! except ... i cannot get the publishing to work. any common tips for debugging issues with plugin publishing?
[05:18:14] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Yeah, I missed the other owner case. I'll add that now.
[05:59:17] <DaveMethvin> jzaefferer: you have two accts, joern and jzaefferer, both go to your gmail
[05:59:30] <DaveMethvin> oh i see that was in my buffer playback
[06:00:14] <jzaefferer> DaveMethvin: thanks. I tried to restore password, but never got an email...
[06:00:39] <DaveMethvin> i can set the pw if you want
[06:03:39] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: nevermind, Dave got me back inside
[06:56:07] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: so the problem i'm running into figuring out the proxy part
[06:56:17] <danheberden> is that the proxies all redirect to running node servers
[06:56:24] <danheberden> instead of, like, nginx serving a page
[06:56:25] <scott_gonzalez> right, and there's no server for error.log
[06:56:30] <danheberden> yeah
[06:57:05] <scott_gonzalez> So, kinda ghetto, but we can spawn up a node server that just serves this page.
[06:57:09] <danheberden> i'm trying, i just don't know that much about it
[06:57:23] <danheberden> well, i wrote a nginx module for puppet
[06:57:26] <danheberden> and i think we use it
[06:57:30] <danheberden> so it shouldn't be *that* hard
[06:57:37] <danheberden> but fml on trying to figure it out
[06:57:38] <scott_gonzalez> Is nginx installed on jq02?
[06:57:58] <danheberden> yeah, we put it as a default package on all servers
[06:57:59] <scott_gonzalez> If so, can we just get nginx to serve the file and have nginx on jq01 proxy to nginx on jq02?
[06:58:17] <danheberden> yeah, we'll need to move the file though
[06:58:20] <danheberden> to its own folder
[06:58:25] <danheberden> i'm confused about one thing
[06:58:33] <danheberden> the config.json doesn't have the error.log entry
[06:58:43] <danheberden> where did you put it?
[06:58:44] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, there's a defult for all paths.
[06:59:02] <danheberden> oh so you put that as the default in the site's script itself
[06:59:02] <scott_gonzalez> If you edit config.json and add "errorLog": "/path/to/somewhere" it'll work.
[06:59:08] <danheberden> oh gotcha
[06:59:29] <scott_gonzalez> Then you can just move the file and send a SIGHUP to the manager.
[07:00:27] <scott_gonzalez> FYI https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/blob/master/lib/config.js is what sets the default paths.
[07:00:28] <danheberden> "And then inadvertently crash the entire jQuery infrastructure"
[07:00:46] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[07:00:48] <danheberden> gnarf, you're not around by chance, are you?
[07:00:54] <danheberden> i need some hand holding
[07:01:00] <scott_gonzalez> I can do the SIGHUP if you want.
[07:01:05] <danheberden> haha
[07:01:17] <danheberden> ok
[07:01:19] <scott_gonzalez> Then you can be like, "It was Scott. He broke everything."
[07:01:39] <danheberden> lol. i messed up ALL the configurations but it was SCOTT who set them into motion
[07:01:45] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[07:02:34] <scott_gonzalez> If you want, just tell me the path and I'll update the config.
[07:02:58] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea if we're tracking configs in puppet.
[07:03:07] <scott_gonzalez> But I can make sure to circle back with gnarf whenever he's around.

[08:02:12] <jasonday> would anyone be willing to look at my manifest, and setup on github? One plugin published w/o issue, the other one won't see to go
[08:02:46] <scott_gonzalez> jasonday: which repo?
[08:04:08] <jasonday> tagged version:¬†https://github.com/jasonday/printThis/tree/0.1.1
[08:04:48] <scott_gonzalez> jasonday: I already told you that you can't delete and re-add the tag.
[08:05:23] <jasonday> no? files seemed to update when I did
[08:05:35] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but hte plugins site will ignore it.
[08:05:41] <scott_gonzalez> As a side note, you shouldn't list your license as MIT & GPL as there is no such license.
[08:05:45] <jasonday> ah. ok, so new tag?
[08:05:49] <scott_gonzalez> You should have two separate license entries.
[08:05:56] <jasonday> ok, can do
[08:06:00] <jasonday> thanks for the input
[08:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> jasonday: Yup, new tag, and make sure to update the version inside the manifest.
[08:06:20] <jasonday> will do, much appreciated
[08:06:30] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[08:07:14] <scott_gonzalez> jasonday: I'll watch the logs to see when your submission comes through.
[08:07:23] <jasonday> thanks scott
[08:07:32] <scott_gonzalez> But I'm on the W3C PEWG call right now, so I may be a bit delayed.
[08:08:04] <jasonday> np
[08:21:44] <scott_gonzalez> jasonday: It worked
[08:21:51] <scott_gonzalez> http://plugins.jquery.com/printThis/
[08:22:29] <jasonday> fantastic, sorry for low priority issues
[08:23:04] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[08:23:35] <scott_gonzalez> We're working on a validation system and making the error log public.
[08:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> Eventually we'll have it notify you when there's a problem.
[08:26:31] <jasonday> I like the github issues approach
[10:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: you around?
[10:05:22] <nacin> yeah
[10:05:45] <scott_gonzalez> Did you see the message about the API sites and the index page?
[10:06:11] <nacin> reading now
[10:06:14] <nacin> how can I help?
[10:07:06] <scott_gonzalez> How can I get it to stop using the static index page plugin?
[10:12:07] <nacin> not sure how, but the page-on-front values were set specifically in the DB
[10:12:33] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:12:58] <nacin> not really sure how
[10:13:05] <nacin> jquery-wp-content doesn't go near those
[10:13:17] <nacin> it is possible that someone went into the admin and hit something
[10:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[10:13:32] <scott_gonzalez> I want it disabled on /1.8/ and /1.9/
[10:13:41] <scott_gonzalez> But I still want the static index plugin to work for the main site.
[10:13:56] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: is there an easy way to get resources to build on the plugins site?
[10:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> At least for now. I may remove it from the main site at some point.
[10:14:03] <danheberden> since we're doing manual sync'ing stuff
[10:14:12] <danheberden> it isn't syncing them to wordpress (i.e. gw-resources)
[10:15:01] <scott_gonzalez> grunt.helper( "wordpress-sync-resources", path.join( dir, "resources/" ), fn );
[10:15:17] <scott_gonzalez> Just hardcode the path like we do for the post syncing.
[10:29:20] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano danheberden: When are we doing these deploys?
[10:29:47] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Were you updating the DB on stage?
[10:30:17] <ajpiano> i can probably do it in about an hourish, don't think i'm gonna be ready to do learn today though
[10:30:17] <nacin> I pushed a commit that should fix it
[10:30:29] <nacin> the DB doesn't actually have anything in it
[10:31:54] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Thanks, that fixed it for me locally.
[10:32:14] <scott_gonzalez> I guess when GitHub gets their shit together and post-receive hooks get sent out, stage should start working.
[10:33:13] <scott_gonzalez> What a great time for hooks to be hosed ;-)

[10:36:36] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Can you see what's going on ?
[10:37:20] <scott_gonzalez> Seems to just be the index page.
[10:37:34] <nacin> Looking.
[10:37:56] <nacin> only stage, right? nothing in prod I need to scramble for?
[10:39:07] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[10:39:22] <nacin> there PHP error logs somewhere? can't find them.
[10:39:24] <scott_gonzalez> If you know where the PHP error log is, I might be able to track this down.
[10:39:25] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[10:39:44] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: Do you know where the PHP error logs are for jq01?

[10:40:07] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: it's your fault, not mine :)
[10:40:13] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Probably.
[10:40:24] <nacin> for the record, /var/log/nginx/*.error.log
[10:40:44] <scott_gonzalez> Think it's mad about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/2d660ca6a243c31e9f7b16bef079ce7d5cd78c71#L1R13 ?
[10:40:44] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, Scott Gonz√°lez (15h 27m ago): New index page for api.jqueryui.com/*
[10:41:01] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yes, that is PHP 5.4+
[10:41:07] <nacin> possibly 5.5, I don't remember.
[10:41:11] <nacin> either way, north of 5.3.
[10:41:29] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'll split that to two lines.
[10:41:40] <nacin> $thisVersion = end( explode( "/", JQUERY_LIVE_SITE ) );
[10:42:06] <nacin> end() needs an array by reference, never mind.
[10:42:51] <scott_gonzalez> Oy.
[10:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> You're killing me.
[10:42:59] <nacin> two lines it is :)
[10:43:00] <scott_gonzalez> Because that worked for me.
[10:43:04] <scott_gonzalez> And I committed :-P
[10:43:18] <nacin> it works, but PHP is likely issuing an E_STRICT underneath.
[10:43:50] <scott_gonzalez> I have all errors turned on.
[10:44:06] <nacin> by all, do you mean E_ALL?
[10:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> Let me check. I'm pretty sure I have the ` | E_STRICT`
[10:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> At least, when I wrote PHP I always had that turned on.
[10:44:40] <nacin> well anyway it issues a strict notice in 5.3
[10:44:55] <nacin> they change their minds every so often what E_ALL actually means, I can never keep track
[10:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> haha: "Using PHP Constants outside of PHP, like in httpd.conf, will have no useful meaning so in such cases the integer values are required. And since error levels will be added over time, the maximum value (for E_ALL) will likely change. So in place of E_ALL consider using a larger value to cover all bit fields from now and well into the future, a numeric value like 2147483647 (includes all errors, not just E_ALL)."

[10:47:24] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...jqcommit missed a commit.
[10:48:00] <scott_gonzalez> Well, stage is working now.
[10:54:32] <danheberden> thanks scott_gonzalez, that worked perfect
[11:00:10] <danheberden> i hope we start sending jquery down with a minified payload soon

[13:07:41] <jzaefferer> ajpiano kswedberg DaveMethvin: QUnit blog post draft: http://blog.jquery.com/?p=2501&preview=true
[13:09:01] <jzaefferer> danheberden: you should mention that the upload isn't actually an upload, as the validator runs in the browser, not on our server
[13:09:23] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: looks pretty good, i have a few things i would tweak, do you want me to tell you them or edit in wordpress
[13:10:10] <danheberden> jzaefferer: okie dokie
[13:10:27] <ajpiano> danheberden: also mention that it will only work in browsers that support filereader
[13:10:28] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: just edit in place, I just saved a copy to diff it later
[13:10:34] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: ok
[13:11:07] <kswedberg> ajpiano, while you're in there ‚Ä¶ "Since its useful to have unit tests finish within seconds, tuning tests now becomes a bit easier" Change its to it's
[13:11:19] <ajpiano> kswedberg: yeah i caught a few its vs. it's
[13:11:28] <jzaefferer> One of these days...
[13:11:32] <kswedberg> :)
[13:11:38] <ajpiano> ONE OF THESE DAY'S
[13:11:40] <ajpiano> :p
[13:12:08] <kswedberg> ajpiano: thx. Looks like some issues in the "Other changes are mostly bug fixes" paragraph, too. I'll shut up now and let you do your work. :)
[13:17:04] <ajpiano> kswedberg: what are your thoughts on the use of first person in this post
[13:17:25] <ajpiano> most of our posts use "we/our" instead of "I/my"
[13:17:45] <ajpiano> it makes sense to have some parts in first person singular
[13:18:14] <ajpiano> but usually the exposition of these is very "we" ish
[13:18:26] <kswedberg> ajpiano: I was wondering the same thing. My gut says 1st person plural would be better. But, yeah, if there are places that are clearly J√∂rn referring to himself, ...
[13:18:36] <ajpiano> yeah, ok
[13:18:42] <ajpiano> i will do that, that's my gut as well
[13:18:47] <kswedberg> cool.
[13:18:50] <ajpiano> leave the historical section in first singular
[13:18:53] <ajpiano> but other stuff move to we/our
[13:18:54] <kswedberg> glad our guts align
[13:19:06] <ajpiano> gruesome
[13:19:26] <kswedberg> :)
[13:19:51] <kswedberg> yeah, when he's talking about himself and John, keep it I. 
[13:20:13] <kswedberg> (should be "John and I figured‚Ä¶" not "John and me figured...")
[13:21:20] <danheberden> Me 'n John 'n I
[13:21:20] <ajpiano> i noes
[13:21:34] <kswedberg> ;)
[13:21:55] <kswedberg> speaking of guts aligning: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extispicy
[13:23:08] <ajpiano> oh man, i thought extispicy is what happens if you want them to add more heat to your chicken vindaloo
[13:24:07] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: not sure how this is supposed to read
[13:24:07] <ajpiano> a overhaul of the¬†<a href="https://github.com/jquery/qunit/tree/master/addons/phantomjs">to use their new (since 1.6) callbacks and a few more.</a>
[13:24:18] <ajpiano> an overhaul of what, to use whose new callbacks
[13:24:30] <ajpiano> i assume it's referring to $.Callbacks ?
[13:25:38] <jzaefferer> The link text should be "PhantomJS addon"
[13:25:44] <ajpiano> ok
[13:25:50] <jzaefferer> messed that up
[13:25:56] <jzaefferer> "to use‚Ä¶" should come after the anchor
[13:25:59] <ajpiano> yeah, gotcha
[13:26:01] <danheberden> phantom references in the blog post?
[13:26:07] <danheberden> phantom context?
[13:26:09] <ajpiano> so it's referring to new callbacks in phantomjs
[13:26:18] <jzaefferer> hey danheberden, your validator works, at least it claims my validation.plugin.json is valid
[13:26:23] <jzaefferer> ajpiano: exactly
[13:26:32] <ajpiano> gotcha, found the link! https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/wiki/API-Reference#wiki-webpage-onCallback
[13:26:46] <danheberden> jzaefferer: i got a pile of broken ones - seems to do the trick thus far; adding more stuff currently
[13:26:49] <ajpiano> leave it to jzaefferer to validate the validation of the validator using validation
[13:26:51] <jzaefferer> I just reviewed and merged it, I don't actually know what I'm talking about /o\
[13:27:16] <jzaefferer> I'm tweeting that
[13:27:22] <ajpiano> :D
[13:29:23] <jzaefferer> Now I just need to make this sucker compatible to Core 1.9, since I've got too many deprecations for a patch release :/
[13:29:42] <jzaefferer> Doesn't make sense to release minor without a compat update...
[13:36:45] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: what order did these things happen in
[13:36:58] <jzaefferer> these things?
[13:37:18] <ajpiano> qunit moving out of the jquery repo. qunit getting its own webbsite. qunit being rewwritten to not have a jquery dep.
[13:38:38] <ajpiano> ah ok
[13:38:41] <ajpiano> figured it out
[14:27:05] <jzaefferer> so is there any way for a plugin author to know if the plugin is about to be published or already failed to be published?
[14:27:13] <jzaefferer> I just tagged and pushed prettydate..
[14:29:20] <danheberden> jzaefferer: if i can get this proxy figured out
[14:29:24] <danheberden> i'll have the log published
[14:29:31] <danheberden> and everyone can see what's going on
[14:32:09] <jzaefferer> danheberden: okay. Well, nothing there, yet, even though your validator said it was all good!
[14:32:15] <jzaefferer> will check the log later
[14:34:06] <danheberden> jzaefferer: i can look now if you want
[14:34:46] <danheberden> "has no manifest files"
[14:34:54] <danheberden> jzaefferer: oh
[14:35:00] <danheberden> github/jzaefferer/jquery-prettydate 1.1.1 prettydate.jquery.json has the following errors: Manifest version (1.1.0) does not match tag (1.1.1).

[14:48:34] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: http://blog.jquery.com/?p=2474&preview=true&preview_id=2474&public=1&nonce=327516e730
[14:48:51] <ajpiano> we are able to announce the new site work, blog, jquery.com, contrib, irc, and brand
[14:49:06] <ajpiano> but i am about anxious about the "first impression" we'll make with jquery.com in the current state
[14:49:13] <DaveMethvin> i'm here now, have to get out of this room in about 10 minutes
[14:49:19] <ajpiano> seems to be lacking in the pow and shazam departments
[14:49:39] <danheberden> ajpiano: i'm anxious about those nude pics i put under the konami code 
[14:49:45] <danheberden> ajpiano:  :(
[14:49:52] <danheberden> sry, i got all wrapped up with the plugins stuff
[14:51:02] <ajpiano> nah it's not on you
[14:52:03] <DaveMethvin> oh you want to skype?
[14:52:20] <ajpiano> that was the idea :)
[14:52:21] <DaveMethvin> ok online now
[14:52:31] <ajpiano> ah weird, you have been displaying as online for me the whole time
[14:53:07] <danheberden> i'm getting there
[14:53:08] <danheberden> ... baby
[15:07:51] <ajpiano> jzaefferer: kswedberg updated the post a bunch http://blog.jquery.com/?p=2501&preview=true
[15:22:40] <ajpiano> DaveMethvin: et al, what the heck is the jQuery() (no args) signature on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[15:22:58] <ajpiano> oh, create an empty jQuery object
[15:23:16] <ajpiano> it's just a little confusing that the description is "This method does not accept any arguments"
[15:23:25] <leggetter> I've just published a new plugin to the jQuery register. The first commit worked perfectly. But I made a mistake in the manifest. So, I've updated it, bumped the version, tagged and pushed to github but the changes aren't getting picked up.
[15:23:30] <leggetter> http://plugins.jquery.com/jquery.realtime/
[15:23:32] <ajpiano> considering the 5 sections above it are lists of arguments that jquery accepts
[15:23:56] <leggetter> Any ideas?
[15:24:16] <ajpiano> leggetter: when did you update, like 19 minutes ago?
[15:24:40] <ajpiano> ah i see you just pushed 0.0.3
[15:24:56] <ajpiano>  Manifest errors: github/leggetter/jquery.realtime 0.0.2 jquery.realtime.jquery.json [ 'Manifest version (0.0.1) does not match tag (0.0.2).' ] that was 19 mins ago
[15:25:06] <ajpiano> but i see the 0.0.3 7 minutes ago
[15:25:25] <leggetter> ajpiano: yeah, just trying to get it to update.
[15:25:26] <ajpiano> leggetter: can you try pressing the "Test Hook" button in your settings for your repo for the plugins site webhook?
[15:25:35] <leggetter> ajpiano: sure
[15:25:38] <ajpiano> thanks
[15:26:18] <leggetter> ajpiano: done. Would be nice if github gave you some feedback about if it has been triggered :)
[15:26:58] <ajpiano> leggetter: that did it!
[15:27:03] <ajpiano> http://plugins.jquery.com/jquery.realtime/
[15:27:26] <ajpiano> we have some weird timing issues that we're still working out
[15:27:44] <ajpiano> wrt to when tags get pushed and trigger the hook, vs. when we can actually fetch the new tags from the repo
[15:28:04] <leggetter> ajpiano: Cool. Thanks. Since 0.0.1 is useless is there any way of getting rid of that?
[15:28:21] <ajpiano> we definitely are working on getting better user feedback to sbumissions
[15:28:24] <ajpiano> nope
[15:28:32] <ajpiano> you shouldn't delete old tags
[15:29:44] <leggetter> ajpiano: I understand. But, it just has an incorrect entry in the manifest. No code changes at all. All version bumps were simply to try and get the registry to see changes.
[15:29:55] <ajpiano> yep
[15:33:24] <leggetter> ajpiano: Hmmm, the missed version makes me feel dirty too. Oh, well‚Ä¶ if you're sure I can't delete that tag‚Ä¶ :) Thanks for your help.
[15:42:00] <ajpiano> man why do people quit irc
[15:42:02] <ajpiano> :p
[15:46:19] <ajpiano> oh man
[17:13:17] <rworth> jzaefferer two instances of "addons"/ in blog post should be changed to "add-ons"
[17:13:38] <rworth> one is "addons" the other "addon"
[17:14:47] <rworth> also, there's a weird line break in the "API reference" link text

[18:06:27] <DaveMethvin> whatsa matter danheberden, your modem giving you trouble?
[18:08:42] <danheberden> i was only able to connect at 19.2
[18:08:50] <danheberden> AND I HAVE A 56k MODEM
[19:18:52] <danheberden> ajpiano: in other news, this is hard to make not look like shit
[19:19:06] <ajpiano> haha yeah i'm talking about it with tim right now
[19:19:27] <danheberden> but i made a windows8 version!
[19:19:28] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/d0a8d05.png
[19:19:43] <ajpiano> haha
[19:21:39] <ajpiano> hm maybe we can go look at the original comp for a bit of inspiration
[19:35:29] <ajpiano> danheberden: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ijn0g92ht6xicm4/w0J5EiZhtq/jquery.com#f:jQuery-Home3.png isn't a bad direction
[19:35:33] <ajpiano> even if we sorta change what's in the boxes
[19:36:18] <danheberden> do we want some kind of big heading?
[19:36:24] <danheberden> do we want to still boast "write less. do more"
[19:36:26] <danheberden> or whatever?
[19:36:43] <ajpiano> i could live with write less do more being up there
[19:37:26] <ajpiano> it's in the logo though
[19:38:09] <ajpiano> i have like this vague idea for like
[19:38:18] <ajpiano> $( document ).ready( app.init );
[19:38:20] <ajpiano> like
[19:38:24] <ajpiano> how you should actually use jquery :p
[19:40:20] <ajpiano> i think i could live with the banner as is, or with more depth on the download box
[19:40:32] <ajpiano> if the bototm of the page had more rhythm
[19:42:03] <danheberden> oh, duh
[19:42:06] <ajpiano> even simple stuff like adding the styling to the sidebar... i'll try and take a crack at some stuff
[19:42:14] <ajpiano> ?
[19:42:20] <danheberden> about the write less do more
[19:42:50] <ryanneufeld> hehe, the cross browser icon spins
[19:46:04] <ajpiano> danheberden: you gonna go with it ?
[19:46:23] <danheberden> ajpiano: what do you mean?
[19:46:32] <ajpiano> i can't tell what you mean :p
[19:46:37] <danheberden> haha, sorry
[19:46:45] <danheberden> i'm going to probably mess around with the banner
[19:46:49] <danheberden> but working on these project images now
[19:46:53] <danheberden> tired of photoshop
[19:46:55] <ajpiano> ok, yeh, i'm all forthat
[19:46:56] <danheberden> so made the sprites
[19:47:01] <ajpiano> sweet
[19:47:13] <ajpiano> i think doing the project images like, in the box type things on the mockup
[19:47:27] <danheberden> are we back on master for jquery.com?
[19:47:31] <danheberden> just with no tag?
[19:47:35] <ajpiano> instead of the "showcase"
[19:47:37] <ajpiano> yep
[19:47:52] <danheberden> ugh
[19:48:06] <ajpiano> not a fan?
[19:50:42] <danheberden> not of the box thing - i should have a screen of what i mean
[19:50:49] <danheberden> or at least some css to help us with styling
[19:51:17] <ajpiano> ok
[19:56:07] <danheberden> hmm, should i just these to the base jquery theme?
[19:56:44] <danheberden> needs to be named right 'n stuff, but http://danheberden.com/share/376c8.png
[19:58:17] <ajpiano> hmm, i suppose i can see that being useful cross project
[19:58:18] <danheberden> ajpiano: quick question - if i'm in a row that is 8 columns
[19:58:25] <ajpiano> danheberden: i have a quick fix
[19:58:27] <danheberden> and i want to make these 25% width
[19:58:47] <danheberden> do i do 3 columns since it's a 12 column grid?
[19:58:51] <ajpiano> yep
[19:58:58] <ajpiano> well
[19:59:00] <ajpiano> you can also nest rows
[19:59:24] <ajpiano> so you can just make that a <div class="eight columns row"> and then you have a new 12 col grid inside
[19:59:43] <danheberden> oh gotcha
[19:59:48] <danheberden> that's whats going on right now
[19:59:48] <danheberden> ok
[19:59:56] <ajpiano> yea
[19:59:56] <danheberden> perfect
[19:59:59] <ajpiano> but we were gonna remove that maybe...
[20:00:10] <ajpiano> cause it was why there was extra pading on the left side, IIRC
[20:00:21] <ajpiano> but we could also solve that with css
[20:01:00] <danheberden> this is what i was thinking http://danheberden.com/share/e50b3.png
[20:01:20] <danheberden> but, you know, less shitty
[20:01:42] <ajpiano> it's kind of reminiscent of jquery.org
[20:01:44] <danheberden> and then the members on the right column
[20:01:46] <danheberden> yeah
[20:01:57] <danheberden> we should do the cool 3d carousel 
[20:01:57] <danheberden> haha
[20:02:00] <ajpiano> hahahaha
[20:02:04] <ajpiano> good lord
[20:02:19] <ajpiano> i'm going to make the sidebar area look more sidebarly
[20:02:22] <ajpiano> it makes a diff
[20:02:44] <danheberden> do you like the project images?
[20:03:33] <danheberden> ajpiano: ^
[20:03:50] <ajpiano> i kind of liked them as the live tiles
[20:04:39] <ajpiano> just the color blocking
[20:05:12] <ajpiano> you could do that with just css based on the stuff you just did though
[20:09:55] <danheberden> you mean the windows8 tiles?
[20:10:29] <danheberden> i should head back to the hotel
[20:15:33] <ajpiano> oh man
[20:15:35] <ajpiano> your'e still there?
[20:15:43] <ajpiano> yeah
[20:15:49] <ajpiano> the windows8
[20:19:35] <ajpiano> you should go
[20:24:01] <ajpiano> danheberden: http://cl.ly/image/2H050F161u36
[20:24:12] <ajpiano> just gonna add the basic sidebar styles, brings it up a bit
[20:24:21] <ajpiano> and hopefully you are already on the way home lol
[20:30:01] <danheberden> ajpiano: i like it
[20:30:09] <danheberden> so put the windows8 on top of that?
[20:30:12] <danheberden> or like, in a row under?

[20:40:35] <danheberden> though i so need some time to write it properly
[20:40:38] <danheberden> it's ghetto js
[20:41:07] <ajpiano> hm
[20:41:14] <ajpiano> making the "and more" link to browser support page
[20:41:15] <ajpiano> in teh header
[20:41:20] <ajpiano> kind of silly
[20:41:27] <ajpiano> because that page only talks about those 5 browsers
[20:42:39] <danheberden> haha
[20:42:49] <danheberden> but it doesn't link there?
[20:43:01] <danheberden> or were you about to make it link there?
[20:43:19] <ajpiano> yeah, that's something we had discussed earlier
[20:43:31] <ajpiano> taking out the version #s
[20:43:57] <danheberden> yeah, maybe just "Details here" or something
[20:44:15] <danheberden> Chrome, IE, FX, Opera and Safari. Details Here. 
[20:44:26] <danheberden> Click here to like this page
[20:44:37] <danheberden> or "jQuery has invited you to play bubble slots!"
[20:45:04] <ajpiano> ha yea
[20:45:14] <ajpiano> i am thinking of just making "Cross Browser" into a link
[20:45:28] <danheberden> mmmm, shitty banana bread from 7eleven
[20:46:53] <danheberden> so. many. fucking. tabs

[20:48:58] <danheberden> seeing a color name in the class name makes me sad
[20:49:38] <danheberden> but my own fault for not being more involved when new-css was created
[20:50:14] <ajpiano> the color classes?
[20:50:19] <ajpiano> that's something i added not too long ago
[20:50:34] <ajpiano> i pulled it out of the brand stuff so that i could use it on the contrib as well
[20:50:51] <danheberden> ok ajpiano i'm done http://danheberden.com/share/b53899b.png
[20:51:02] <danheberden> ajpiano: yeah, it's just, like some are a color name, some are project name
[20:51:07] <ajpiano> yeah
[20:51:12] <danheberden> when it should be "jqueryui-primary", "jqueryui-secondary", etc
[20:51:22] <ajpiano> danheberden: it's a little shitty, you can fix it if you want
[20:51:31] <ajpiano> i was hustlin when i did it though
[20:51:36] <danheberden> ajpiano: just bitching cuz i'm tired and it's late
[20:51:39] <ajpiano> i know
[20:51:40] <danheberden> and my head hurts from today
[20:51:44] <danheberden> and we have to be at the office at 8:30
[20:51:48] <ajpiano> yeah
[20:52:09] <danheberden> (the i'm done was a joke, btw)
[20:52:23] <ajpiano> hahah i figured :D
[20:52:29] <ajpiano> i was like :o
[20:54:12] <ajpiano> you should prob leave the office if you haven't yet
[20:54:37] <danheberden> i'm back at the hotel :)
[20:54:41] <danheberden> shit it's cold out there!
[20:55:00] <danheberden> ajpiano: http://danheberden.com/share/702a2b.png
[20:55:02] <danheberden> somethign like this?
[20:56:00] <ajpiano> danheberden: i guess i meant in under the jquery family in the sidebar :p
[20:56:09] <danheberden> oh, hahahaha
[20:56:11] <danheberden> I KNEW THAT
[20:56:14] <ajpiano> hahah
[20:56:15] <danheberden> i was just testing you
[20:56:26] <ajpiano> lemme show you somethin
[20:56:35] <danheberden> if i had a nickel...
[20:56:58] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/image/3G3A2K2a0U0r
[20:57:23] <danheberden> oh shit
[20:57:24] <ajpiano> those were just color studies from the branding
[20:57:26] <ajpiano> but like
[20:57:29] <ajpiano> something about them i like a lot
[20:57:33] <danheberden> yeah
[20:57:34] <danheberden> goddamnit
[20:57:35] <ajpiano> and we have them as EPSes in the dropbox
[20:57:38] <danheberden> the whole logo is nice
[20:57:51] <ajpiano> i mean AI
[20:57:52] <danheberden> either way, we need to make the full logos as a sprite
[20:57:57] <ajpiano> yea
[20:58:03] <danheberden> goddamnit ajpiano
[20:58:12] <ajpiano> sorry danheberden
[20:58:15] <danheberden> "here, let me just show you something that looks WAY BETTER THAN WHAT YOU DID"
[20:58:16] <danheberden> hahahahaha
[20:58:19] <ajpiano> :/
[20:58:23] <danheberden> it dose make a big different though
[20:58:27] <danheberden> and is remarkably readable
[20:58:36] <danheberden> no it's good ajpiano
[20:58:39] <danheberden> i'm just playin :)
[20:58:44] <danheberden> thanks for pointing it out
[20:58:56] <danheberden> i'm good at making sprite images!
[20:59:07] <ajpiano> danheberden: actually though
[20:59:22] <ajpiano> you could accomplish the same thing with image tags referring to ... images in the theme :/
[20:59:31] <ajpiano> cause they're all in there, the logos prepared for on dark
[20:59:44] <danheberden> yeah, it's just that they would be scaled by the browser
[20:59:47] <danheberden> which i guess isn't awful
[20:59:51] <ajpiano> trew
[21:00:03] <ajpiano> danheberden: you shouldn't drive yourself nuts with manually spriting
[21:00:10] <ajpiano> we should implement it in the build process
[21:00:21] <danheberden> well, actually
[21:00:26] <ajpiano> the only reason the thing in the header is a sprite is because it was a sprite when i inherited it
[21:00:30] <danheberden> the might be just... oh, nope, too big
[21:00:31] <ajpiano> so i just rolled with it
[21:02:15] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: I just read your email
[21:02:17] <ryanneufeld> you flatter me
[21:02:26] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: what do you mean?
[21:02:38] <danheberden> was the "slender touch bring me almost to tears" too much?
[21:02:45] <ryanneufeld> "I know this is really easy for you"
[21:02:55] <danheberden> oh, i guess i worded it differently
[21:03:02] <ryanneufeld> lol
[21:03:13] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: well i have good news
[21:03:18] <danheberden> i'm eating sour cream and onion pringles
[21:03:22] <danheberden> so, there's that
[21:03:39] <vladikoff> danheberden, those are not so god
[21:03:43] <ajpiano> danheberden: i'm about to eat my lunch left overs :p
[21:03:43] <vladikoff> good*
[21:04:13] <danheberden> ajpiano: haha
[21:04:16] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: that is good news
[21:04:20] <danheberden> vladikoff: they are the pringles of the gods
[21:04:30] <danheberden> i mean, i'm totally assuming gods eat pringes there
[21:04:46] <danheberden> also, hi vladikoff!
[21:04:49] <ryanneufeld> If I was a god, i would
[21:06:09] <ajpiano> danheberden: i held down the up arrow key for a while
[21:06:15] <ajpiano> i think i have something that works great
[21:06:16] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/image/3j1J3k413r1H
[21:07:54] <ryanneufeld> OMG ajpiano I FUCKING LOVE IT
[21:09:36] <ajpiano> ship it
[21:12:12] <ryanneufeld> so danheberden you need to move a log file, and then proxy it to another domain?
[21:12:17] <ryanneufeld> is that right?
[21:12:28] <ryanneufeld> you want to serve an error log?
[21:15:40] <danheberden> yes
[21:15:49] <danheberden> moving isn't a big deal
[21:15:55] <danheberden> it's namely, like, serving it from somewhere
[21:16:38] <danheberden> because we can just add 'errorLog':'path/to/error/log' to https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/jquery/templates/plugins.erb
[21:20:49] <danheberden> oh, shit, forgot to paste the image
[21:20:55] <danheberden> and i was waiting on ajpiano to respond
[21:20:55] <danheberden> lol
[21:21:04] <danheberden> ajpiano: this look good? http://danheberden.com/share/fc2a7f.png
[21:21:06] <ajpiano> loll
[21:21:09] <danheberden> obvs the top left
[21:21:41] <ajpiano> viable for now
[21:22:19] <ajpiano> i think i'm gonna come up with a dead simple who's using section for now
[21:24:27] <danheberden> do you think we'll need that?
[21:24:35] <danheberden> with the project logos and members?
[21:24:50] <ryanneufeld> should just be "Everyone"
[21:24:52] <danheberden> FUCK 
[21:24:57] <danheberden> forgot the cert
[21:24:59] <danheberden> fuck fuck fuck
[21:27:10] <ajpiano> danheberden: i think it might liven up the space in between "what is jquery" and where the examples go
[21:27:55] <danheberden> ajpiano: sounds good
[21:34:15] <danheberden> ok, cert bought but i think we'll need gnarf to get it setup
[21:35:26] <ajpiano> ok
[22:00:34] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: I'm as lost as you buddy
