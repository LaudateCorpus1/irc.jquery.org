[08:03:47] <[_VK_]> Hi there - i was suggested to come here because my plugin doesn't seem to be registered ..
[08:04:06] <[_VK_]> anyone about that could help .. ?
[08:05:02] <scott_gonzalez> [_VK_]: Which repo?
[08:05:34] <[_VK_]> github.com/vonKristoff/Shards
[08:05:51] <[_VK_]> I got the hook in place, and my manifest passed the test ..
[08:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> Tue, 04 Jun 2013 14:26:32 GMT github/vonKristoff/Shards 1.1.0 shards.jquery.json has the following errors: Manifest version (1.1) is invalid.
[08:07:12] <scott_gonzalez> http://plugins.jquery.com/error.log
[08:07:32] <[_VK_]> dang..!
[08:09:22] <[_VK_]> sure i corrected that .. i have an updated tag, and my json file is set to 1.1.0 already
[08:09:41] <scott_gonzalez> You can't change a tag.
[08:09:47] <scott_gonzalez> You need to create a new tag with a different version.
[08:09:53] <[_VK_]> do i need to delete it?
[08:10:08] <[_VK_]> I have 1.1 tagged and 1.1.0 tagged
[08:10:22] <scott_gonzalez> You don't need to. The plugins site will ignore anything it has already looked at.
[08:10:27] <scott_gonzalez> 1.1 isn't a valid semver.
[08:11:18] <[_VK_]> thanks .. so i have added this new tag .. site still doesn't register plugin ..
[08:11:55] <[_VK_]> this is over 30mins ago - being that it should be recognised after 5mins .. makes me suspect ..
[08:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see any new tags.
[08:23:06] <[_VK_]> i made a 1.0 tag, and then 5mins later made 1.1.0 tag .. I have deleted the 1.1 tag - should i create a 1.1.1 tag?
[08:28:12] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[08:28:13] <[_VK_]> ayi that worked and its reg'd .. thanks for putting me to the error log :)
