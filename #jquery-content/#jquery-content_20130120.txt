[17:32:44] <rworth> richardscarrott the name must match the filename (before the .jquery.json) and "v0.1.1" is not a valid semver (though it is an accepted tag). It must be "0.1.1" without the v
[17:33:18] <rworth> that's on jquery-mousestop-event
[17:34:40] <rworth> looks like jquery-modal has similar issues
[17:35:30] <rworth> and rs.carousel
[17:37:51] <richardscarrott> ah, I didn't catch on to the manifest file having to match the name
[17:38:10] <richardscarrott> I thought 'v' was allowed in the version number though?
[17:38:29] <danheberden> rworth: what is the situation with conflicting plugin names?
[17:38:44] <danheberden> like, ben_alman and i have a plugin with the same name that is actually useful
[17:38:56] <danheberden> and someone else already posted a plugin with that name that does something totally different, lol
[17:39:30] <richardscarrott> or is 'v' allowed in the tag name but should in fact be omitted from the manifest number?
[17:42:16] <danheberden> richardscarrott: the tag 0.1.1 has to also be present as a tag in github
[17:42:44] <danheberden> so while github is fine you labeling it v0.1.1 (cuz, hell, they'll let you tag something "ithinkgithubsmells")
[17:43:23] <danheberden> you need the tag to a) be a semver version (x.y.z) and b) be present in your repo
[17:44:10] <richardscarrott> Can the tag be prefixed with the a 'v'?
[17:44:45] <danheberden> not if you want it to work with the jQuery plugins site
[17:48:41] <richardscarrott> it says here - http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/ "The name of the tag must be a valid semver value, but may contain an optional v prefix"
[17:49:20] <danheberden>  i'll defer to rworth, since i was going by his original comment
[17:58:11] <rworth> richardscarrott the name of the tag has that allowance, the version number in the manifest has to be a valid semver, which doesn't have that allowance
[17:59:03] <rworth> danheberden the plugin name conflict thing was covered fairly well in the annc blog post
[17:59:07] <rworth> first-come first-serve
[17:59:15] <richardscarrott> got it thanks for the help
[17:59:43] <rworth> we'll only take action if a very obviously de facto reserved (for years) name is squatted or otherwise swooped by someone
[17:59:53] <rworth> bbq was the example given in the blog post, and is a good one
[18:00:32] <rworth> something like carousel is far away a totally different story, since the name is far from unique and no reasonable argument could be made at one person/plugin having claim on it per public perception
[18:02:44] <danheberden> crappy
[18:02:47] <danheberden> oh wells
[18:03:14] <danheberden> i wonder what i can rename serializeObject to
[18:03:18] <danheberden> formToObject?
[18:03:22] <danheberden> hmmm
[19:05:13] <tkirda> Hello
[19:05:19] <tkirda> Is anyone there?
[19:07:16] <ajpiano> hi tkirda
[19:07:34] <ajpiano> i am here but on a mediocre train wifi connection
[19:07:37] <tkirda> I'm having trouble registering plugin
[19:07:55] <tkirda> https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete
[19:07:56] <ajpiano> let me see if i can get on to see the logs
[19:08:31] <tkirda> thanks
[19:08:56] <tkirda> any help would be appreciated, looks like everything is setup on my side
[19:11:11] <ajpiano> tkirda: the name in the manifest has to match the name of the ____.jquery.json
[19:11:45] <tkirda> it did then I tried renaming, can I name it autocomplete?
[19:14:09] <tkirda> was it name that caused the issue?
[19:19:03] <tkirda> ok, updated manifest to match the name 
[19:19:23] <tkirda> should I retag the repository?
[19:26:48] <tkirda> can you shoot me an email at tomas@devbridge.com if you find out what is the probem?
[19:36:02] <ajpiano> tkirda: yeah i think it is the name that caused the issue
[19:36:08] <ajpiano> sorry like i said this internet connection is really mororse
[19:39:31] <tkirda> understandable
[19:39:49] <tkirda> update file name to match the name: devbridge-autocomplete
[19:39:52] <tkirda> updated tag
[19:40:05] <tkirda> tested hook
[19:40:24] <tkirda> but not seeing it on plugins site
[19:40:44] <richardscarrott> Hi there, I'm also still having trouble registering a plugin, it's late here so it could be blindingly obvious but I think I've got everything set up right - https://github.com/richardscarrott/jquery-ui-carousel , I wonder if anyone could take a quick look?
[19:44:14] <richardscarrott> tkirda, you're manifest has an invalid version number I believe
[19:44:20] <richardscarrott> *your
[19:45:04] <tkirda> because it has v in front?
[19:45:10] <richardscarrott> The 'v' isn't allowed in the manifest
[19:45:18] <tkirda> are you sure?
[19:45:24] <richardscarrott> yeah, it's fine to have the 'v' in the tag name
[19:45:47] <tkirda> so fine in tag name, but not in the manifesto?
[19:46:34] <richardscarrott> yeah I made the same mistake - from rdworth "the name of the tag has that allowance, the version number in the manifest has to be a valid semver, which doesn't have that allowance" where 'that allowance' is the 'v'
[19:47:02] <tkirda> ok, updating
[19:47:15] <ajpiano> tkirda: hey, yeah let me try and look again
[19:47:31] <richardscarrott> saying this I'm still not seeing any of my plugins on the site
[19:48:43] <tkirda> still nothing
[19:49:55] <tkirda> It would be nice to have some sort of mechanizm to verify validity of the manifesto and get feedback from the plugin site
[19:52:28] <tkirda> ajpiano: thanks for looking into it
[19:53:33] <richardscarrott> Yeah agreed that would be useful, your autocomplete is set up the same way as my plugins, I've been looking through some plugins that have made it onto the site I can't find any that us 'v' in the tag name so I'm wondering if that's the issue...
[19:56:10] <tkirda> let's see what ajpiano tells...
[19:59:37] <ajpiano> richardscarrott: tkirda both of those are captured in issues and high priorities to get in place soon :)
[19:59:48] <rworth> tkirda you need to change the version in the manifest from "v1.2.2" to "1.2.3" then tag 1.2.3 (or v1.2.3)
[20:00:06] <ajpiano> manually interfacing with everyone who has trouble obviously isn't too practical for us either
[20:00:29] <tkirda> ok, thanks for you help, let me try
[20:06:51] <tkirda> ajpiano: just made changes per your instructions
[20:07:53] <tkirda> but don't see updates, yet
[20:35:08] <tkirda> it's there! thanks ajpiano.
