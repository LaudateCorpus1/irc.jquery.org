[04:15:23] <gnarf> nacin: are you around?
[07:04:11] <jedimind> quick question, wondering if there's a repo somewhere that has a flat html version of the api docs ?
[07:04:16] <jedimind> or a pdf
[07:05:00] <scott_gonzalez> jedimind: nope
[07:05:06] <scott_gonzalez> The source is all XML.
[07:05:14] <scott_gonzalez> It goes through XSLT to generate the content.
[07:05:15] <jedimind> well poop
[07:05:24] <scott_gonzalez> But then that goes through WordPress templates.
[07:05:52] <scott_gonzalez> jedimind: Let me build something and see if it's useful for you.
[07:06:28] <jedimind> don't put yourself out, i mean i appreciate it of course, but I'm sure i can find something out there
[07:06:36] <jedimind> i just wanted to throw it into a dropbox and access it on a tablet
[07:10:48] <rmill> jedimind: Would it not be trivial to parse the XML?
[07:10:54] <rmill> And make a page..?
[07:11:29] <jedimind> yeah it probably would
[07:13:00] <scott_gonzalez> jedimind: http://temp.nemikor.com/wordpress.zip
[07:13:26] <scott_gonzalez> There's no styling, and no nav, but that's all the content in post-processed HTML format.
[07:13:56] <jedimind> that's perfect, all i need
[07:13:58] <jedimind> thanks man, much appreciated
[07:14:01] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[07:14:11] <scott_gonzalez> That's the content we send to WordPress.
[07:14:40] <scott_gonzalez> If you're interested in doing anything custom...
[07:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> content is here: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com
[07:15:13] <scott_gonzalez> XSLT is here: https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/tree/master/tasks/jquery-xml
[07:15:25] <jedimind> great, thanks, i have a 6 hour flight ahead of me, i may tinker :)
[07:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> entries2html-base.xml is the main XSLT.
[07:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> Each API site extends that: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl
[07:21:56] <jedimind> thanks a lot :)
[07:22:23] <scott_gonzalez> There's also http://api.jquery.com/resources/api.xml
[07:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> Which is a dump of all the XML.
