[10:00:31] <ajpiano> hi everyone

[10:38:05] <ajpiano> agcolom: yes, hoping for tomorrow
[10:40:08] <agcolom> excellent! thank you
[10:45:23] <nacin> ajpiano: is there a separate jquery-content-meeting channel? or jquery-meeting? I've reduced my idling to just here.
[10:45:50] <gnarf> nacin: just -meeting for everyone
[10:45:59] <ajpiano> jquery-meeting
[10:46:25] <nacin> okay. don't hesitate to summon me if you ever need anything in any other channels.
[10:46:46] <ajpiano> sounds good but i'll say you've settled in the right place :)
[11:30:49] <gnarf> ajpiano scott_gonzalez https://github.com/jquery/qunitjs.com/issues/41
[11:30:50] <b-ot> gnarf: Issue #41 by jzaefferer (2m 21s ago): Setup blog.qunitjs.com or qunitjs.com/blog
[11:31:10] <gnarf> should it just be a category in the jquery blog maybe?
[11:31:18] <ajpiano> yeah we are going to merge everything
[11:31:35] <jzaefferer> but the category can show up on qunitjs.com/blog?
[11:31:55] <jzaefferer> should I move that issue elsewhere?
[11:32:06] <gnarf> i would think more http://qunitjs.com/blog -> http://blog.jquery.com/qunit/
[11:32:15] <ajpiano>  yeah i don't think we'd want it duped in two places
[11:39:32] <jqcommit> [13api.qunitjs.com] 15jzaefferer opened issue #20: Get QUnit API into Visual Studio Intellisense  02http://git.io/80cARw
[11:46:34] <jzaefferer> so what about blog.jqueryui.com?
[11:46:42] <jzaefferer> will that also redirect to blog.jquery.com?
[11:50:03] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[11:53:42] <rworth> and on blog.jquery.com the posts will be at the top level and /qunit/ is just a category, right?
[11:54:37] <scott_gonzalez> Should probably be /category/qunit/ like any other category.
[11:58:03] <agcolom> ajpiano: you know that issue with the broken 'o' letter... I can't reproduce it. I've tried on my colleague's MBP with the same os and Safari versions as mentioned (same as yours too).
[12:04:34] <rworth> scott_gonzalez yeah

[13:44:28] <ajpiano> agcolom: yeah, i have no idea
[13:44:34] <ajpiano> one way to fix it without having to dupe it
[13:44:47] <ajpiano> would be to just not use font awesome where it wraps text
[13:44:53] <ajpiano> and instead do our icons with <i> or whatnot
[13:48:45] <agcolom> strange though... I'm wondering whether it could be a setup on his machine?

[14:45:44] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14d11dfd4 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: added missing closing p tag in panel.xml
[14:59:18] <ajpiano> agcolom: the reporter doesn't have a local setup of our stuff though
[14:59:30] <ajpiano> though points out he saw it in other uses of font awesome, not sure at all real
[14:59:31] <ajpiano> ly
[15:10:34] <agcolom> yes... what is the name of the font again? I'll do a quick search...
[15:10:52] <agcolom> font awesome ...
[15:24:58] <agcolom> other people mention problems with the letter o not displaying at all (not on our site), but I haven't found anything like an o with the arrow... 
[15:27:54] <agcolom> ajpiano: I meant some settings in his browsers...
[15:28:23] <agcolom> though strange he sees this on 2 browsers...
[15:28:42] <ajpiano> agcolom: yea i saw that same issue
[15:28:45] <ajpiano> about no O at all
[15:28:50] <agcolom> yes
[15:28:50] <ajpiano> but you know
[15:28:53] <ajpiano> we have a font stack
[15:28:56] <ajpiano> that i put in there
[15:29:07] <ajpiano> so maybe it's using an obscure unicode point in the next choice font
[15:29:11] <ajpiano> instead of a missing o
[15:29:14] <ajpiano> i can test that in a few minutes
[15:29:14] <agcolom> yes
[15:30:15] <agcolom> Bedtime for me I think... teaching 4h tomorrow.... 
[15:30:42] <agcolom> goodnight ajpiano !
[15:30:50] <ajpiano> ok goodnight agcolom !
[15:31:14] <agcolom> thanks!
