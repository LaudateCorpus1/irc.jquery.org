[11:00:53] <arthurvr> jhonny23: Hey! Thatâ€™s good to hear! We have a getting started page for students here: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students
[11:03:26] <jhonny23> arthurvr: Thanks for the reply..I already went through this page..the project that seems most interesting to me is 'Interactive tutorials for learn and other sites'..so can you suggest some specific task related to this particular project..Thanks :)
[11:07:20] <arthurvr> jhonny23: Sure I can! There are 30 open issues :)) https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues. What kind of task in particular youâ€™re interested in?
[11:09:09] <shaks018> arthurvr: Hi, I thought of working on issue 77 https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/77  but it seems to have a PR already.Could you suggest me some more issues to work on?
[11:10:09] <jhonny23> arthurvr: I am mostly interested in doing any specific task which is related to the project I mentioned.. I mean would you like me to develop something in order to show my skills..I have done few projects involving jquery and jquery mobile..so any specific development task will be appreciated :)
[11:13:07] <arthurvr> shaks018: Yeah, sorry! :)) Maybe https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/566? Before you start working on it, be sure to post some ideas/thoughts on the issue, so other people can share what they think.
[11:18:41] <arthurvr> jhonny23: I can't think of any really technical tasks regarding the learning center atm. Maybe scott_gonzalez has an idea? If you're willing to work on the a little less technical tasks (writing), checkout the open issues. All of them are  searching for somebody to take them :))
[11:19:30] <arthurvr> Also cc agcolom. Sheâ€™s the mentor for that project.
[11:23:37] <jhonny23> scott_gonzalez: Are there any technical task in your mind which you want me to work on?
[11:24:01] <scott_gonzalez> Nope. I don't really do much with the learn site.
[11:24:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'd suggest looking through https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/issues for content-related technical tasks.
[11:25:12] <scott_gonzalez> There may be some in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues as well.
[11:27:35] <jhonny23> Thanks :) I will look into those
[11:28:27] <shaks018> arthurvr: thank you! Can i work on issue https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/335 as well?
[11:29:22] <arthurvr> shaks018: Thereâ€™s already an open PR for that.
[11:29:25] <arthurvr> shaks018: Sorry!
