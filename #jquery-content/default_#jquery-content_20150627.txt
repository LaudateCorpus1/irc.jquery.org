[06:56:50] <kswedberg_> arthurvr: didn't have a chance. Emily left the conference before I tweeted at her. Will follow up this weekend via internets. From what I heard in the presentation, though, seems like it makes sense to force https. Do you agree, agcolom ?
[06:57:16] <arthurvr> Yeah that was my feeling as well
[08:30:38] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15gnarf opened issue #766: Document jQuery.easing for adding easing functions 02http://git.io/vtRiF
[08:51:25] <gnarf> found one kind of annoying thing
[08:51:35] <gnarf> *.jquery.com cert wont cover stage.api.jquery.com
[08:51:54] <gnarf> which means I'll have to maintain separate configs for stage and live
[10:49:25] <agcolom> kswedberg_ arthurvr: yes, I agree
[10:56:59] <arthurvr> kswedberg_: agcolom: gnarf: letâ€™s do it then :)
[10:57:27] <arthurvr> gnarf: that thing with the cert is that a big deal? Isnâ€™t there a way they can share their configs? :/
[11:21:30] <m_gol> I'm getting a database error on `grunt deploy` when using the vagrant setup on freshly cloned repos... does anyone know about it?
[11:21:58] <m_gol> I was following http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/#workflow
