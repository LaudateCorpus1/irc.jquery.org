[15:07:05] <olleicua> Hi, I'm looking for input on this github issue: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/1075
[15:07:31] <olleicua> basically I noticed a hole in the docs
[15:08:27] <olleicua> fyi: I am significantly more likely to notice replies on the GH issue than here because I don't typically use irc
