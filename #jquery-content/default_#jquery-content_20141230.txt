[06:42:41] <arthurvr>  Hi guys! Morning!
[06:43:07] <arthurvr> just a ping for the about learn.jquery.com
[06:44:07] <arthurvr> we should really make a final decision about https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/257 
[06:44:55] <arthurvr> I just feel like we shouln't maintain a hole section (with much open issues) when it's going to get replaced shortly
[08:00:17] <kswedberg> arthurvr: after reading that thread, it's unclear what the status is. scott_gonzalez: is using MDN still a possibility?  
[08:00:56] <arthurvr> also cc ajpiano, he originally opened the issue
[08:07:03] <arthurvr> just the thing is that of 44 issues open in there 15 are regarding javascript 101
[08:07:32] <arthurvr> I could work on fixes for all of them, but that wouldn't make sense when replacing that section with an external resource.
[08:14:47] <ajpiano> hey
[08:14:59] <ajpiano> i really never was sure what i wanted to come out of that
[08:15:35] <ajpiano> based on the fact that it seems like we wantt o remove the overhead of maintaining "non-jQuery" stuff it would seem like figuring out a way to get MDN or something else into the site would be useful
[08:15:50] <ajpiano> btw hi arthurvr thanks so much for like, everything youve been doing
[08:16:29] <arthurvr> ajpiano: Hope I help out! Thanks for everything you're doing too!
[08:17:34] <arthurvr> Btw, I'm +1 on replacing the section with external resources.
[08:17:46] <arthurvr> See how hard it is to maintain these days
[08:18:06] <arthurvr> MDN has fantastic content and now we're just duplicating that.
[08:19:12] <arthurvr> However we should still express that it's important to know javascript well for every jquery developer.
[08:21:27] <arthurvr> cc scott_gonzalez will the licensing still be a problem?
[08:24:30] <ajpiano> yeah - i'm glad you agree that it should be *there* in some capacity though

[08:55:39] <arthurvr>  Once again this hole discussion above shows that there is a need for a meeting to follow up things properly.
[08:56:14] <arthurvr> As we already discussed earlier btw http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-content/default_%23jquery-content_20141223.log.html#t08:06:52
[08:58:46] <agcolom> arthurvr: gnarf: yes, I agree also for the need for a regular content meeting. I think the plan was to have one every 2 weeks, we need to find a suitable slot for all people involved. 
[08:59:08] <agcolom> arthurvr: are you in GMT+1?
[08:59:51] <arthurvr> yes I am
[09:00:43] <gnarf> noon est seems a pretty magic time for meetings in the team
[09:00:43] <arthurvr> If you want me to and that would be useful, I'il setup a doodle we can send around the team
[09:00:50] <gnarf> but yeah
[09:00:52] <gnarf> lets doodle it
[09:01:03] <gnarf> try to reach out to some of the people who contrib on github
[09:01:22] <gnarf> cc danheberden ^^^^^^
[09:01:26] <arthurvr> okay. I'il just pick email adresses from their github profiles?
[09:01:57] <gnarf> we could open a "Schedule a content meeting" issue and cc them somewhere maybe
[09:02:08] <arthurvr> that may be better too
[09:02:12] <arthurvr> I'il take care of that
[09:02:29] <arthurvr> what repo?
[09:02:33] <arthurvr> irc.jquery.org?
[09:02:57] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/meetings.jquery.org/issues lol
[09:03:01] <gnarf> so meta
[09:03:02] <gnarf> but sure
[09:03:18] <arthurvr> lol, let's do it in there ;-)
[09:03:25] <arthurvr> in 30 minutes I open it
[09:03:52] <agcolom> wednesday would be good for me I think (Already have meetings tuesdays and thursdays)
[09:05:19] <agcolom> I finish at 6pm mondays so that's no good
[09:18:27] <arthurvr> just asking, but why did you guys ever stopped doing meetings?
