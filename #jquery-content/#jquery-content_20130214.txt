[07:32:05] <ajpiano> nothing critical, just wondering why wordpress was not up
[07:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[07:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if this is that intermittent domain mapping issue that people have been seeing?
[07:34:28] <ajpiano> i was wondering the same thing too
[07:34:36] <ajpiano> or if it is at least related
[07:35:20] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Are you able to tell what happened from the logs?
[07:41:46] <gnarf> nothing more
[07:42:21] <gnarf> might be worth logging the error output in that case?
[07:42:37] <gnarf> or even dropping the content served into a file to look at after it fails?
[07:42:48] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have access to the actual response.
[07:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> The xml-rpc module doesn't expose the raw data.
[07:43:15] <gnarf> well, isn't that annoying
[07:43:21] <scott_gonzalez> It sure is.

[08:55:49] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: hi! Is now a good time to catch you to try and do my first tag and deploy of the api.jquerymobile.com?
[08:56:45] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Give me 5 minutes.
[08:56:55] <agcolom> sure, that's great! Thank you!
[09:09:30] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: ready
[09:09:37] <agcolom> ok, 
[09:09:51] <agcolom> so I'm in my terminal... 
[09:10:34] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: This is for 1.2 or 1.3?
[09:10:41] <agcolom> I would like to learn how to tag and push what is currently on stage.api.jquerymobile.com to api.jquerymobile.com
[09:10:52] <agcolom> well 1.3 sort of beta...
[09:11:07] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:11:15] <scott_gonzalez> npm version minor
[09:11:27] <scott_gonzalez> When you run that it should say 1.3.0
[09:11:48] <agcolom> oh, it gives me tons of errors!
[09:12:11] <scott_gonzalez> Can you put the output in a gist?
[09:12:21] <agcolom> I was in resources...
[09:12:46] <agcolom> so I'm now just in api.jquerymobile.com and I didn't get any error or any output
[09:13:21] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..
[09:13:28] <scott_gonzalez> That's not right.
[09:14:01] <agcolom> should I be in  api.jquerymobile.com  ? (the folder)
[09:14:05] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:14:13] <agcolom> ok, that's where I am
[09:14:16] <scott_gonzalez> `npm version patch` should output 1 line.
[09:14:25] <scott_gonzalez> errr... `npm version minor` in this case.
[09:14:37] <scott_gonzalez> It should've said "v1.3.0"
[09:14:47] <scott_gonzalez> what does `git tag` show?
[09:15:01] <agcolom> 1.2.0
[09:15:01] <agcolom> v1.3.0
[09:15:01] <agcolom> v1.4.0
[09:15:33] <agcolom> where do these come from??
[09:15:51] <scott_gonzalez> From the commands you just ran.
[09:15:56] <scott_gonzalez> You'll need to clean this up.
[09:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> git tag -d v1.3.0
[09:16:06] <scott_gonzalez> git tag -d v1.4.0
[09:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> git reset --hard origin/master
[09:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> Before you run that last one...
[09:16:51] <scott_gonzalez> You didn't have any commits that you didn't push, right?
[09:17:04] <scott_gonzalez> Because right now you'll have at least one commit that you don't want to push.
[09:17:11] <scott_gonzalez> And we need to get rid of it.
[09:17:16] <agcolom> no all commits are pushed
[09:17:26] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:17:30] <agcolom> I've done git tag -d v1.3.0
[09:17:30] <agcolom> 5:16 PM <scott_gonzalez> git tag -d v1.4.0
[09:17:33] <scott_gonzalez> so `git reset --hard origin/master`
[09:17:45] <agcolom> but not yet the git reset
[09:18:07] <agcolom> I just do git reset --hard origin/master ?
[09:18:11] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:18:22] <agcolom> done
[09:18:31] <scott_gonzalez> Now your package.json should have "version": "1.2.0" again.
[09:18:44] <scott_gonzalez> Can you confirm that it doe?
[09:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> s/doe/does/
[09:19:08] <agcolom> "version": "1.2.0",
[09:19:12] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:19:21] <scott_gonzalez> back in the terminal, `npm version minor`
[09:19:53] <agcolom> done. that changed the version to 1.3.0
[09:20:03] <agcolom> (in package.json)
[09:20:04] <scott_gonzalez> Did it produce any output this time?
[09:20:10] <agcolom> no, no output
[09:20:14] <scott_gonzalez> That's very strange.
[09:20:15] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well.
[09:20:20] <agcolom> oh well :-)
[09:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> `git tag` should show v1.3.0 again.

[09:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> perfect

[09:21:26] <agcolom> rejected
[09:21:40] <scott_gonzalez> You weren't up to date?
[09:21:46] <agcolom> should I do a pull ?
[09:21:56] <scott_gonzalez> We need to do the reset again.
[09:22:00] <scott_gonzalez> Because you have a bad tag.
[09:22:04] <scott_gonzalez> git tag -d v1.3.0
[09:22:06] <agcolom> I though I was... maybe someone made a change
[09:22:09] <scott_gonzalez> git reset --hard origin/master
[09:22:15] <scott_gonzalez> Last change was 16 hours ago.
[09:22:39] <agcolom> that should be my change then!
[09:22:50] <scott_gonzalez> Your last change was 19 hours ago.
[09:22:57] <agcolom> ok, should I do git pull --rebase?
[09:23:02] <scott_gonzalez> no
[09:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> git reset --hard origin/master
[09:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> git tag -d v1.3.0
[09:23:14] <scott_gonzalez> git pull

[09:23:58] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14ef3ba9d 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: 1.3.0
[09:24:05] <agcolom> yes!  * [new tag]         v1.3.0 -> v1.3.0
[09:25:49] <scott_gonzalez> And it's live!
[09:26:53] <agcolom> This is exciting!!!! Thank you v much! (Sorry for not checking whether I was uptodate!)
[09:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[09:27:32] <scott_gonzalez> So, in the future, it's as simple as:
[09:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> npm version <something>
[09:27:43] <scott_gonzalez> git push && git push --tags
[09:27:59] <agcolom> and the version can be 1.3.0-1?
[09:28:01] <scott_gonzalez> <something> depends on what you want to do with regard to the version number.
[09:28:04] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[09:28:09] <agcolom> perfect!
[09:28:10] <scott_gonzalez> That would be `npm version build`
[09:28:19] <scott_gonzalez> If you want 1.3.1, use `npm version patch`
[09:28:37] <scott_gonzalez> If you want to be explicit, you can use `npm version 2.3.4`
[09:29:12] <agcolom> fantastic! So something is either build, patch or a number
[09:29:36] <scott_gonzalez> Well, it can also be `minor` or `major`
[09:29:51] <scott_gonzalez> We used minor just now to go from 1.2.x to 1.3.0
[09:29:59] <scott_gonzalez> major.minor.patch-build
[09:30:10] <scott_gonzalez> Setting one always reset the lower ones.
[09:30:32] <scott_gonzalez> So `npm version major` would results in 2.0.0
[09:30:55] <agcolom> right. Now I need to copy and paste all of this in a file ! 
[09:31:13] <agcolom> Thank you v much again! 
[09:32:10] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Just go find the email I sent :-)
[09:32:36] <agcolom> the one you sent on the 24th Jan? 
[09:32:48] <agcolom> (that you mentioned last week?)
[09:33:30] <scott_gonzalez> yup

[09:34:11] <ajpiano> which we could just update
[09:34:11] <gnarf> widget factory category needs description
[09:34:46] <ajpiano> gnarf: i just added some commits
[09:34:47] <ajpiano> including that
[09:35:03] <ajpiano> i added like a 2 sentence thing for now
[09:35:11] <scott_gonzalez> something > nothing
[09:35:15] <ajpiano> yeah
[09:35:47] <ajpiano> so, question.... should i squash merge that
[09:35:52] <ajpiano> or just take it in as all the commits
[09:36:01] <ajpiano> i would rather not squash it
[09:36:32] <gnarf> indifference
[09:36:42] <ajpiano> ok
[09:36:49] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: have you done a read through of the content in that pull yet?
[09:37:25] <gnarf> some of it is obviously old
[09:37:35] <gnarf> might be nice to do some quick changes if we can
[09:38:06] <ajpiano> i gave it a once over, it seemed.. ok
[09:38:44] <ajpiano> gnarf: is there stuff that's sticking out in your mind
[09:38:52] <scott_gonzalez> not yet
[09:39:52] <scott_gonzalez> I may die from stress if I don't get 1.10.1 released and start my Toronto keynote.
[09:40:16] <ajpiano> and yeah, i really need to just push go on this thing already
[09:40:21] <ajpiano> so i want there to be some UI stuff
[09:40:24] <ajpiano> and we can go from there
[09:43:57] <gnarf> fair nuff
[09:44:15] <gnarf> ajpiano: not really, i fixed most of the glaringly bad stuff
[09:44:19] <gnarf> when i ported
[09:44:23] <ajpiano> gnarf: nic
[09:44:24] <gnarf> but i remember reading some of it and being like
[09:44:25] <ajpiano> ok
[09:44:27] <gnarf> this is way old
[09:44:32] <ajpiano> yeah, some of it is just not fresh
[09:49:22] <ajpiano> alrighty then
[09:52:04] <gnarf> feel free to land, with or without squash
[09:52:18] <gnarf> i mean, i don't mind a squash that links to a pull in most cases

[10:03:51] <gnarf> oops
[10:04:00] <gnarf> that might be a good one to make sure we move
[10:04:39] <gnarf> or is that one of the ones we already moved? :)
[10:04:47] <gnarf> so hard to remember
[10:04:53] <gnarf> i've been reading so much widget factory stuff
[10:04:59] <gnarf> its all jumbled together
[10:11:04] <ajpiano> comments from scott_gonzalez say it's deprecated but there is probably some copy in ther we can borrow
[10:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, there's some stuff in https://github.com/scottgonzalez/widget-factory-docs
[10:11:46] <scott_gonzalez> But it's not complete either.
[10:26:12] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: did any of that get merged into the ui-docs branch on learn?
[10:26:27] <gnarf> was that what @RWhitbeck did?
[10:26:27] <scott_gonzalez> no idea
[10:26:53] <gnarf> yeah, looks like it

[10:27:12] <RWhitbeck> yeah I ported those straight over
[10:27:46] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you could prolly kill that repo and README.md link it over to learn
[10:27:54] <gnarf> all that content is in the page/jquery-ui folder now

[16:29:52] <ajpiano> woohoo
[16:30:04] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i managed to get the blogs updated
[16:30:09] <ajpiano> and i didn't delete any plugins sites
[16:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[16:33:44] <scott_gonzalez> awesome
[17:21:08] <rmill> oi, is there a place to get this now → https://raw.github.com/nlogax/ircjsbot-plugins/master/jqapi.json for b-ot?
[17:21:15] <rmill> pretty sure that .json is mad outdated
[17:21:40] <rmill> I curl'd it off the old jQuery API site like a gangsta.
[17:24:44] <scott_gonzalez> rmill: No, the JSON API isn't available yet.
[17:25:08] <scott_gonzalez> It's high on my todo list though.
[17:25:53] <rmill> Ya, like, ideally the bot could just point to wherever it is on github, so it's always updated.
[17:26:04] <rmill> Das coo if there ain't none.
[17:26:16] <scott_gonzalez> There's an XML dump right now: http://api.jquery.com/resources/api.xml
[17:26:22] <scott_gonzalez> It's always up-to-date.
[17:28:11] <rmill> Is the format the same? Would I be able to drop it into the bot?
[17:28:19] <rmill> .json is preferred, forsh
[17:28:29] <rmill> I can wait ;)
[17:28:54] <rmill> I might need to re-write that plugin if the structure changes…
[17:29:40] <scott_gonzalez> It'll probably be the same as the old one.
[17:29:48] <scott_gonzalez> The whole service needs to be rewritten though.
[17:30:11] <scott_gonzalez> The XML -> JSON conversion happened at the time of querying for the old one.
[17:30:25] <scott_gonzalez> Definitely not how it should be implemented :-)
