[06:39:33] <rmill> Is there any plan to remove `<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.js"></script>` from the examples on api.jquery.com?
[06:41:42] <DaveMethvin> rmill it would be a lot of work to go through and update every example each time we released
[06:42:54] <rmill> I was just curious. No way to automagically put in the latest version number? :)
[06:43:38] <rmill> Just seems problematic if that's what's being advocated in the examples... I can see how most users will just copy/paste blindly.
[06:56:02] <rworth> seems like we should be able to work that in to the deploy process for the api site(s). rmill can you file an issue on api.jquery.com/issues ?
[06:56:12] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: It'd be very little work, hopefully.
[06:56:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L13
[06:57:07] <scott_gonzalez> I can check if there are other references.
[06:57:31] <DaveMethvin> i think we should just turn them into images so nobody can copy/paste :D
[06:57:51] <rworth> they'll ocr ;)
[07:02:59] <rmill> ha
[07:03:08] <rmill> I will file.

[07:16:03] <DaveMethvin> bugs.jquery.com is for code bugs
[07:17:28] <rmill> I had a feeling I did that wrong.
[07:19:42] <rmill> <-- NOOB
[07:24:00] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15rmillr opened issue #266: Examples on api.jquery.com are pointing to jquery-latest  02http://git.io/87tR_Q
[07:24:36] <rmill> scott_gonzalez: apologies.
[07:24:46] <scott_gonzalez> rmill: no problem
[07:28:03] <kswedberg> rmill: in what way is pointing to jquery-latest.js problematic? (I believe it; just don't know what the problems have been)
[07:29:05] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: copy/paste, then users put it in production.
[07:29:24] <scott_gonzalez> The examples are for learning, they shouldn't encourage bad usage patterns.
[07:29:48] <rmill> yeah
[07:30:24] <kswedberg> gotcha
[07:30:30] <rmill> kswedberg: That whole freakshow when .browser got dropped, for example.
[07:32:45] <kswedberg> rmill: so what would have prevented that freakshow? what's the solution? Add a jquery.js file to the api site and point to that? 
[07:33:22] <rmill> Or, whatever version is currently most recent.
[07:33:47] <rworth> adding a jquery.js file to the api site means people hotlinking
[07:33:48] <rmill> IDK, It just seems odd to me is all, to be like "Don't use jquery-latest... Here, use it."
[07:33:57] <rworth> happened for years on jQuery UI demos
[07:34:08] <rworth> there are still sites trying to hotlink to files on jqueryui.com
[07:34:48] <rmill> DaveMethvin's idea of making it an image, is actually not a bad one. haha
[07:35:12] <DaveMethvin> where's my disable-right-click script?
[07:35:16] <kswedberg> rworth: true, but if you set up the server to redirect or not allow or whatever from the get-go, shouldn't be a problem.
[07:36:24] <rworth> kswedberg true
[07:37:54] <kswedberg> maybe we could also add something in the xslt or something to inject a little note about where to get yer own jqueries with a link?
[07:38:39] <kswedberg> wow, that was some of my finest writing right there.
[07:38:52] <rmill> I'm not quite sure what the perfect solution is, TBH.
[07:43:41] <scott_gonzalez> You just put a version number in the script tag.
[07:43:58] <scott_gonzalez> This is an easy problem.
[07:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> The perfect solution is to use a versioned file from the CDN.
[07:44:48] <rmill> I kinda figured it was. And that's the solution I would have suggested.
[07:46:27] <kswedberg> ok. I'm all for easy. I was misunderstanding the problem. I thought y'all didn't want a link to code.jquery.com in general.
[07:48:21] <kswedberg> we'll just need to remember to update the script reference with each new release. no biggie.
[07:48:52] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, you can even make that DaveMethvin's resposibility :-)
[07:49:04] <scott_gonzalez> Just tack it on to his release checklist.
[07:49:18] <kswedberg> hehe. I love passing the buck to DaveMethvin!
[08:09:21] <gnarf> rworth: have you set jquery.org in your hosts file to point at jq01 yet and tried to deploy to it?
[08:09:44] <gnarf> rworth: we could basically test the whole site via a hosts entry
[08:09:47] <gnarf> and we should
[08:09:53] <rworth> gnarf good thinking
[08:10:26] <rworth> except that would have live stripe keys
[08:10:31] <rworth> so it wouldn't actually be "testing"
[08:11:23] <gnarf> well, i can hit the individual membership i guess
[08:17:39] <gnarf> rworth: published
[08:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: These join forms are totally inaccessible.
[08:18:42] <rworth> scott_gonzalez bummer
[08:18:46] <scott_gonzalez> None of the fields have labels.
[08:19:15] <gnarf> if I join at the "Fan" level, can you upgrade me to a friend? :)
[08:19:32] <gnarf> or can you "cancel" it?
[08:19:39] <rworth> gnarf you'll get a coupon code for Hero since you were a team lead at the hackathon last year
[08:19:52] <rworth> but you can't test that until scott_gonzalez finishes adding support for it
[08:20:03] <gnarf> is that before we launch?
[08:20:13] <rworth> yeah, he's working on it right now
[08:20:25] <rworth> I'm getting the emails ready to send to all the attendees
[08:21:13] <gnarf> cool, i assume that will be a good enough 'test' of the system?
[08:21:45] <gnarf> oh hey, i'm not yoda anymore
[08:21:48] <gnarf> what a shame ;)
[08:22:30] <gnarf> (Note: You'll have to use IE or Firefox to complete the application through the above link. Yes, how very 1999 of us. CardPartner is working on a site update that will support all modern browsers. In the meantime, use IE or Firefox to apply today. Or let us know if a UA spoof does the trick :)
[08:22:32] <gnarf> lol
[08:24:19] <rworth> :)
[08:25:35] <rworth> we can test all over the place on stage. since it's sandboxed with stripe test keys. And we can delete all the test data and retest. Then when we go live we'll have the few of us do our coupon code thang for real before feeling comfortable sending out emails
[08:25:53] <rworth> soft launch today, see how it goes over the weekend, then blog post first thing Mon
[08:25:56] <gnarf> k, working on the redirects

[09:42:53] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: ^
[09:43:56] <scott_gonzalez> Are these coupons all $ based?
[09:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> As opposed to % based?
[09:46:30] <rworth> scott_gonzalez yes
[09:46:54] <scott_gonzalez> ok, good
[09:47:02] <rworth> I don't think we'll ever do % based since we don't restrict coupon use by plan
[09:47:05] <scott_gonzalez> Because I didn't see any way to tie a coupon to a plan.
[09:47:12] <scott_gonzalez> The code I wrote supports both though.
[09:47:12] <rworth> exactly
[09:47:16] <rworth> ok, great

[13:58:22] <ryanneufeld> is the sponsor carousel supposed to show WP and MT twice?
[13:58:44] <rworth> that's the design, I guess, but I don't get it
[13:59:07] <ryanneufeld> yeah, vladikoff just noticed it
[14:00:34] <vladikoff> hehe yeah 
[14:44:46] <vladikoff> ryanneufeld, https://brand.jquery.org/ is giving me an https alert in chrome
[14:45:15] <ryanneufeld> that's a gnarf thing
[17:53:58] <jqcommit> [13learn.jquery.com] 15ralphimo opened pull request #314: Update event-delegation.md (06master...06patch-1)  02http://git.io/uxKAEA
[18:54:08] <rworth> it makes sense that there would be no https support on brand.jquery.org. What doesn't make sense it why the Brand Guide link in the top-nav on jquery.org switches to https when in menu-header.php it's http
[18:54:33] <rworth> maybe gnarf or nacin or scott_gonzalez knows if we're doing some kind of url filtering
[20:14:24] <gnarf> vladikoff: i don't think it's intended to have that on ssl
[20:14:56] <gnarf> vladikoff: not sure why its linking to https://
[20:14:57] <vladikoff> gnarf, https://jquery.org/ nav links to it as https
[20:15:00] <vladikoff> right
[20:15:02] <gnarf> cc rworth ajpiano
[20:15:17] <gnarf> we only have "jquery.org" cert
[20:15:28] <rworth> right, that's the only one we want and need
[20:15:57] <rworth> but weird that in menu-header.php it's http but then in the view source of https://jquery.org/ it's https
[20:31:05] <vladikoff> rworth, it's using WP set_url_scheme, checks if is_ssl() , and I guess because the site is under SSL it sets the pattern ( http://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/tags/3.5.1/wp-includes/link-template.php#L2235 )
[20:33:08] <vladikoff> from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/themes/jquery/menu-header.php#L149
[20:33:10] <vladikoff> so hmm
[20:43:13] <rworth> thanks for finding that vladikoff

[23:37:55] <gnarf> vladikoff / rworth did we fix that https issue on brand?
[23:38:11] <rworth> gnarf I just created an issue for it
[23:38:32] <rworth> https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/issues/38
[23:38:32] <b-ot> rworth: Issue #38 by rdworth (1m 30s ago): Top nav link to Brand Guide should be http not https
[23:53:48] <vladikoff> gnarf, whoever is the WordPress master on this should fix it up haha
