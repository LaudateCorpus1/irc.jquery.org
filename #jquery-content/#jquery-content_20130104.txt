[01:48:53] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: let me know what you think of https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/c10f96315da8932f04127a2dc08a209f53bdc491, i think it makes the left sidebars make a lot more sense for api & learn
[01:49:03] <ajpiano> catch you in a few hours presumably
[01:49:10] <ajpiano> bedtime for now :)
[05:53:26] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: sorry, just saw you pinged me yesterday. Not sure how I missed it until now.
[06:03:15] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Let me know when you're around.
[06:03:46] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: The screenshots of the highlighting look good. I've got some UI stuff that I need to work on today, but I might get back to sites this afternoon.
[06:04:25] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: As for the padding on the sidebar, I just lined it up according to my discussion with 47m.
[06:04:33] <scott_gonzalez> I think the new style is fine.
[06:04:48] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: I wanted to ask you about the JSONP API stuff.
[06:05:11] <kswedberg> ok.
[06:05:56] <kswedberg> anything in particular? 
[06:06:09] <scott_gonzalez> How does it work?
[06:06:11] <scott_gonzalez> What does it do?
[06:06:49] <scott_gonzalez> I was going to see if I could reimplement it, but I had no idea what I was trying to implement :-P
[06:11:50] <kswedberg> currently, it basically lets you query the database for title, version, category and get back a set of results
[06:12:07] <kswedberg> here is a demo: http://test.learningjquery.com/jqas/
[06:13:24] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks, so I should be able to reverse engineer it from view-source:http://test.learningjquery.com/jqas/scripts/search.js, right?
[06:14:21] <kswedberg> well, all the logic is on the server end, to determine what you get back.
[06:14:41] <kswedberg> it's in the jquery.0002 theme. api.json.php
[06:15:52] <scott_gonzalez> Where is that?
[06:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> If I can get the existing script, that'd be easier than reverse engineering it from the demo :-)
[06:17:07] <kswedberg> it's in the old web-jquery-api repo, if it still exists
[06:17:32] <kswedberg> otherwise, I can send it to you. or you can get it from the live api.jquery.com wp admin
[06:18:41] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-api/blob/master/htdocs/wp-content/themes/jquery.0002/api.json.php :-)
[06:19:21] <kswedberg> there it is. please forgive the hackery
[06:21:17] <scott_gonzalez> awesome: $matchtype = @$vars['match'];
[06:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think I've ever seen someone use the shut up operator on an array access.
[06:22:00] <kswedberg> go on. keeping laughing.
[06:22:25] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, I will :-)
[06:23:46] <kswedberg> obviously we don't need the $pluginlist stuff anymore
[06:25:55] <agcolom> ajpiano: The changes look good for mobile, thank you! (re: https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/ecfd65954f437bdfe4efc6f91565465f1df60df3)
[07:05:19] <rworth> Process Type Foundry is going to donate Klavika for our use :)
[07:13:56] <scott_gonzalez> \o/
[07:59:52] <rworth> ajpiano Klavika Web is now on our Purchased Fonts tab in Typekit

[08:07:07] <mikesherov> Ha
[08:09:39] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: awesome!
[08:10:54] <kswedberg> thanks a lot, scott_gonzalez. that was an annoying issue.
[08:11:08] <scott_gonzalez> Figuring out how to fix it was just as annoying :-P
[08:11:45] <kswedberg> ha! I bet.
[08:12:27] <scott_gonzalez> There was some very strange behavior going on.
[09:36:17] <ajpiano> rworth: awesome, i'll drop it in now

[10:25:16] <ajpiano> rworth: thanks for getting that done and rocking it so hard
[10:25:39] <ajpiano> i had a half-typed line in IRC before i went to bed that was asking for a status update on that, but didn't press enter cause i didn't want to jinx it :)
[10:27:30] <rworth> np. Glad it worked out
[10:29:10] <ajpiano> it's good to be jquery
[10:29:15] <ajpiano> did they refund our desktop license :p
[10:29:56] <rworth> I thought of that a little later today. Might be a bit more tricky, since I've already been reimbursed; didn't ask
[10:30:12] <ajpiano> i don't think we should sweat it :)
[10:31:14] <ajpiano> hey anthonybruno
[10:31:28] <anthonybruno> hey
[10:31:59] <ajpiano> btw scott_gonzalez rworth ^^ anthonybruno is from nelson cash, he is the one doing the build out of their stuff in the brand.jquery.org repo
[10:32:21] <ajpiano> hence yesterday's Very Useful‚Ñ¢ pull request
[10:34:06] <rworth> hey anthonybruno 
[10:34:08] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[10:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> hi anthonybruno
[10:34:19] <anthonybruno> hey everyone
[10:39:15] <ajpiano> hmm
[10:39:28] <ajpiano> rworth: qunitjs and sizzlejs aren't included in typekit
[10:39:34] <ajpiano> and when i try to add them it says
[10:39:40] <ajpiano> You may only serve this kit from up to 10 domains. Please contact us if you need more flexibility with your font serving.
[10:39:57] <ajpiano> and that just e-mails support@typekit.com
[10:41:16] <ajpiano> shall i follow up there or do you want to
[10:41:42] <ajpiano> if stupid jquery.com and *.jquery.com were considered 1 instead of 2 we'd be fine
[10:44:00] <rworth> we have to just create another kit
[10:44:13] <rworth> caus there's no way around the 10 domain limit, I asked
[10:44:40] <rworth> hmm, that stinks for all sites sharing a web-base-template header :/
[10:46:33] <ajpiano> ok, it is what it is
[10:46:55] <ajpiano> we can at least write a little dict in the php header so that it's relatively maintainable
[10:46:59] <rworth> yeah
[10:47:07] <rworth> can read from sites.php?
[10:47:19] <ajpiano> donno
[10:47:27] <ajpiano> was probably gonna go a little hackier than that :p
[10:47:27] <rworth> maybe scott_gonzalez has an idea
[10:47:28] <rworth> or nacin 
[10:47:34] <rworth> or that
[10:47:55] <ajpiano> i was just gonna do a thing of like typekitid-> domain
[10:48:01] <ajpiano> would prob be good to get one of them to look at it
[10:48:06] <ajpiano> i wrote some of the worst php last night
[10:48:53] <ajpiano> using a css preprocessor would also simplifiy so much duplication of our font stacks in css #jussayin
[10:49:02] <scott_gonzalez> *.jquery.com is supposed to be part of jquery.com
[10:49:08] <scott_gonzalez> At least according to their site.
[10:49:46] <ajpiano> link?
[10:51:22] <anthonybruno> Is there a reason behind using Typekit rather than @font-face? Sorry to but in.. 
[10:52:16] <ajpiano> adobe donated to us, we had been using it for proxima nova, we're also using it for source code pro
[10:52:33] <anthonybruno> Roger
[10:52:47] <ajpiano> i think scott_gonzalez would be happier if we didn't use it
[10:52:53] <ajpiano> :p
[10:57:08] <scott_gonzalez> anthonybruno: I have no idea why we're using it. I think it's silly.
[10:57:52] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: http://processtypefoundry.com/licensing/webfont-license-agreement
[10:57:55] <ajpiano> i'm fine with switching if we can just get the font files for klavika and source code pro
[10:58:16] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i meant from a typekit perspective
[10:58:43] <anthonybruno> http://processtypefoundry.com/help/#webfont
[10:58:54] <anthonybruno> They allow native. Just a heads up.
[10:58:58] <ajpiano> yeah, i know
[10:59:04] <ajpiano> klavika is easy, it's getting source code pro
[10:59:10] <ajpiano> or picking a different code font
[10:59:16] <ajpiano> i'd be fineish with consolas or whatever
[10:59:48] <anthonybruno> Its interesting that in that webfont agreement it mentions the 10 domains rule
[11:00:06] <scott_gonzalez> 10 domains, but 5 subdomains per domain.
[11:00:07] <anthonybruno> 2b.ii
[11:00:22] <anthonybruno> ah
[11:01:02] <scott_gonzalez> Of course, we'll eventually run into the problem of having more than 5 subdomains for jquery.com.
[11:01:16] <ajpiano> another reason to use @font-face
[11:02:44] <ajpiano> ah
[11:02:46] <scott_gonzalez> So I guess I was confused yesterday. I thought Richard was going to reach out to Process Type Foundry, not Typekit.
[11:02:51] <ajpiano> he did
[11:03:06] <ajpiano> process type foundry gives you a magic code that makes your font available in typekit
[11:03:11] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: don't worry, the thing is solved
[11:03:16] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:03:19] <ajpiano> in our typekit embed settings
[11:03:21] <ajpiano> the domain list was:
[11:03:29] <scott_gonzalez> They're also supposed to give you the actual fonts.
[11:03:33] <ajpiano> jquery.com, *.jquery.com, jqueryui.com, *.jqueryui.com
[11:03:34] <ajpiano> etc
[11:03:35] <ajpiano> i know
[11:03:41] <ajpiano> so there wasn't room for qunit and sizzle
[11:03:45] <ajpiano> but i just simplified it so it
[11:03:52] <ajpiano> *.jquery.com, *jqueryui.com, etc
[11:03:54] <ajpiano> and all domains fit
[11:04:02] <ajpiano> that said, i'm still fine with using @font-face instead
[11:04:13] <ajpiano> yeah, i presume rworth can get them or already has them
[11:18:29] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: danheberden, kswedberg are we ready to change the dns over on api.jquery.com yet?
[11:18:58] <kswedberg> ajpiano: as far as I know, yes.
[11:19:49] <ajpiano> should we do it
[11:20:03] <ajpiano> a lot of the aesthetics will change next week when we make new-css into master
[11:24:33] <danheberden> i just want to make sure jq01 is up to the task
[11:24:49] <danheberden>  /cc ryanneufeld gnarf
[11:25:03] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: task?
[11:25:16] <danheberden> sry, bad word choice
[11:25:32] <danheberden> just that it's ready to handle all the api traffic
[11:25:43] <ryanneufeld> oh, what's it doing now?
[11:26:26] <danheberden> i'm not too sure, hence why i brought you into this :p
[11:26:32] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:26:34] <ryanneufeld> well...
[11:26:38] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/DNS-AXFR
[11:26:43] <ryanneufeld> according to that
[11:26:59] <ryanneufeld> it's already serving jquery.com and jqueryui.com
[11:27:09] <ryanneufeld> but currenly api. is on the EOL machines
[11:27:14] <danheberden> yeah
[11:27:19] <ryanneufeld> I Think gnarf is more familiar with them
[11:27:38] <danheberden> ajpiano is asking about pointing that to the jq01 version
[11:27:54] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: jq01 is an 8GB nitro instance
[11:27:58] <ryanneufeld> whatever that means
[11:28:00] <danheberden> ryanneufeld: indeed
[11:28:24] <ryanneufeld> according to this though
[11:28:26] <danheberden> i thought you were more up to speed on it's current resources - i didn't mean to send you on a wild goose chase :p
[11:28:27] <ryanneufeld> which might be out dated
[11:28:28] <ryanneufeld> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/wiki/jQuery-Server-Architecture
[11:28:58] <ryanneufeld> it might already be serving the api
[11:29:28] <ryanneufeld> I don't see it being an issue
[11:29:45] <ryanneufeld> it looks like it was intended to serve the api
[11:29:55] <ryanneufeld> it's already serving the api for everything else
[11:29:59] <ryanneufeld> lemme check the puppet confs
[11:30:00] <danheberden> yeah, i need to remember how to log into zabbix
[11:30:03] <danheberden> to see the machine's health
[11:31:53] <ryanneufeld> cpu loads are <=2
[11:32:02] <ryanneufeld> typically around 1->1.5
[11:32:08] <danheberden> yeah, i looks ok
[11:32:14] <ryanneufeld> yeah you do
[11:32:19] <danheberden> *it
[11:32:19] <danheberden> haha
[11:32:22] <danheberden> thanks ryanneufeld <3
[11:32:59] * ryanneufeld has several references to orgasmo popping up in his head now
[11:34:50] <ryanneufeld> ok danheberden ajpiano
[11:34:56] <ryanneufeld> I think we can move api to that machine
[11:35:14] <ryanneufeld> but there is some puppet configs that I need to run by gnarf, as I'm not 100% on what's going on
[11:35:41] <ajpiano> yeah, i haven't seen him about in a bit though
[11:35:51] <ajpiano> we are gonna talk about this in a sites meeting in just a few mins
[11:35:52] <ryanneufeld> danheberden: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/wordpress.pp#L75-92
[11:36:22] <ryanneufeld> it seems to me that we just need to add a redirect there from stage-> not stage
[11:36:31] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I can listen in on the meeting
[11:36:36] <ajpiano> cool, hop on skype
[11:36:45] <ryanneufeld> I'm always on :)
[11:36:52] <ryanneufeld> what time is the meeting at?
[11:37:08] <ajpiano> we are just wrapping a board meeting, probably in like 5-10 mins
[11:37:15] <ryanneufeld> ok
[11:37:30] <ryanneufeld> I'll grab my lunch then
[11:37:34] <ryanneufeld> eat while listening
[11:40:02] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: yo
[11:40:49] <nacin> rworth: you could toss in a typekit ID into the sites.php array easily
[11:41:06] <rworth> that's kinda what I was thinking
[11:45:01] <ajpiano> don't think it's an issue anymore
[11:45:21] <ajpiano> cause we are just able to use the wildcard donations for now
[11:45:33] <ajpiano> domains*
[11:45:40] <ajpiano> and i think i'll go @font-face right now
[11:46:00] <ajpiano> or i mean, once we get the file
[11:46:34] <ryanneufeld> ajpiano: I'm taking my lunch break early, I'll just hang out till you're ready to pull me in :)
[11:46:42] <ajpiano> sweet, thanks man
[11:46:45] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: How can we do weighted searches?
[11:47:01] <scott_gonzalez> So a match in the title counts more than a match in the body?
[11:47:03] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: what kind of weight are you thinking?
[11:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/64
[11:47:49] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: we are likely to add some form of weighted search to 3.6. I'll look to see what we can push to jquery.com earlier
[11:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:48:08] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: since you aren't paginating your search results, I should be able to implement this just in PHP
[11:48:14] <nacin> so I will do that
[11:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[11:49:15] <scott_gonzalez> We'll paginate on some sites, but the weighted search is most important on the API sites where we don't paginate.
[12:47:20] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: are you just gonna revert https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/commit/28858500442bedfeff64c14d91639566b4414bca
[12:47:45] <ajpiano> actually reverting would be bad, lol

[12:52:58] <ajpiano> oh scott_gonzalez i wanted to ask you about
[12:53:08] <ajpiano> whether we should include the "mobile" stuff from zurb foundation
[12:53:14] <ajpiano> it seems like we don't have it in base.css
[12:53:43] <ajpiano> so that stuff laid out with the grid would autmatically scale properly on mobile
[12:53:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not the guy you want to talk to about responsive design ;-)
[12:53:52] <ajpiano> heh

[12:56:42] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[12:56:53] <scott_gonzalez> It seems like a sane thing to do.
[13:17:09] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: We can delete the journal font files now, right?
[13:17:19] <ajpiano> oh yeah, i meant to do that!

[13:22:33] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Any objection to removing the margin on the menu header lis?
[13:23:00] <scott_gonzalez> They currently have margin-right: 10px
[13:23:13] <scott_gonzalez> But each anchor has 10px left and right padding.
[13:23:26] <scott_gonzalez> So we end up with 30px between the text of each item.
[13:23:46] <scott_gonzalez> And we have sites with lots of links in the menu header.
[13:24:11] <ajpiano> none whatsoever
[13:24:36] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, we end up with 34px between them because there's a 1px transparent border :-P
[13:24:41] <ajpiano> heh
[13:24:53] <ajpiano> the whitespace above the sidebars is really rubbing me the wrong way
[13:25:21] <ajpiano> http://local.contribute.jquery.com/
[13:25:22] <ajpiano> whoops

[13:25:27] <jqcommit> 13web-base-template/06new-css 14a39df25 15Scott Gonz√°lez: Remove margin from menu header list items.
[13:25:34] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/image/180k3t0m2q0O
[13:25:52] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I know what you mean.
[13:26:45] <scott_gonzalez> We can drop the top padding of the content area to 20px.
[13:28:02] <ajpiano> on what element, #content-wrapper?
[13:28:56] <ajpiano> the padding on that is making my brain hurt
[13:29:10] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/2C2l0o1j0d0A
[13:29:29] <ajpiano> ah, yeah, that's what i was *trying* to do
[13:29:52] <ajpiano> is it weird that the sidebar touches the edge or not
[13:30:20] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think so.
[13:30:28] <ajpiano> yeah, it seems good, def commit that
[13:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> But I can see where you're coming from since nothing else touches an edge.
[13:30:43] <ajpiano> right
[13:31:05] <ajpiano> PUNT
[13:36:45] <scott_gonzalez> Oh boy, this might be a rabbit hole.
[13:37:38] <ajpiano> yeah
[13:38:00] <ajpiano> there's something i don't understand about how the padding is implemented on that #content-wrapper
[13:38:17] <ajpiano> i think just shrinking that little height is good for now
[13:38:39] <scott_gonzalez> Oh well, I'm going to commit what I have.
[13:38:46] <scott_gonzalez> It makes jquery.org even more messed up.
[13:38:47] <ajpiano> yeah, exactly
[13:39:00] <ajpiano> ok
[13:39:00] <scott_gonzalez> But there's obviously something just totally busted with jquery.org.
[13:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> When I look at the rest of the problems on that site, I'll fix this too.
[13:39:16] <ajpiano> yeah i'm about to deploy it and take a look
[13:39:35] <ajpiano> i want to take a pass to see if i can remove using language detection from highlight.js
[13:39:49] <jqcommit> 01[13web-base-template01] 15scottgonzalez pushed 1 new commit to 06new-css: 02http://git.io/DAEHUw
[13:39:49] <jqcommit> 13web-base-template/06new-css 14944ffd6 15Scott Gonz√°lez: Reduce top padding in content area.
[13:39:50] <ajpiano> which saves us the build piece
[13:41:10] <scott_gonzalez> I'm fine with going back and adding language info to all of the code blocks for the UI sites.
[13:41:24] <ajpiano> yeah, and i already did it in the xslt
[13:42:08] <ajpiano> the only thing that is really left in syntax highlighgting before it can go in
[13:42:13] <ajpiano> is fixing the out denting
[13:42:42] <ajpiano> it seems to be mostly working, but on some snippets it seems to remove one indent too few, and if i try to correct, it removes one indent too many on all the ones that were working :p
[13:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> heh, ok, I can take a look at that next week.
[13:44:24] <ajpiano> yeah i would love to be able to cut a new grunt-jquery-content version on monday
[13:45:13] <scott_gonzalez> ok, just remind me on Monday :-)
[13:45:25] <ajpiano> ok !
[13:46:02] <ajpiano> the basic thing to taking out using highlight's auto-detect is
[13:46:14] <ajpiano> then i will default to "javascript" for all snippets
[13:46:23] <ajpiano> that don't get identified by us as xml, or don't have a language
[13:46:38] <ajpiano> but i think the only things we *have* are xml and javascript
[13:47:36] <scott_gonzalez> Are xml and html the same?
[13:47:46] <ajpiano> yeah, we have to mark html as xml, actually
[13:47:56] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[13:48:02] <scott_gonzalez> that's weird
[13:48:31] <ajpiano> neither syntaxhighlighter nor highlight.js actually have languages/brushes for "html"
[13:48:33] <ajpiano> both just "xml"
[13:51:16] <danheberden> http://danheberden.com/share/072e5.png
[13:51:49] <ajpiano> should i tweet about it
[13:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> ZOMG, TELL THE WORLD!
[13:52:08] <ajpiano> oh god
[13:52:11] <ajpiano> it has the aLL PROEJCTS MENU
[13:52:18] <ajpiano> man i haven't seen that thing in DAYS
[13:52:23] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[13:52:38] <ajpiano> oh man new-css can't come soon enough
[13:52:39] <scott_gonzalez> api.jquery.com has been infected by api.jqueryui.com
[13:53:01] <scott_gonzalez> Spread the All Projects menu along with the wrong jQuery Mobile logo!
[13:53:20] <ajpiano> haha yeah those two things are making me not want to say anything :p
[13:53:40] <scott_gonzalez> Also, a link to learn in the footer :-)
[13:53:55] <ajpiano> lolo
[13:53:59] <scott_gonzalez> Should we yank that link until the learn site launches for real?
[13:54:06] <ajpiano> yeah
[13:54:24] <ajpiano> should we move the new nav and colors to master? :/
[13:54:35] <ajpiano> or just let this ride for a week
[13:54:51] <ajpiano> kswedberg: http://api.jquery.com
[13:55:07] <scott_gonzalez> Let's let it ride.
[13:55:12] <ajpiano> +9001
[13:55:13] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully we can pull off the switch on Monday.
[13:55:55] <ajpiano> yeah
[13:55:58] <kswedberg> yay!
[13:57:43] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15iambrandonn opened issue #199: Quick Access CDN link at bottom of page is not latest version  02http://git.io/5tc0IA
[13:57:44] <kswedberg> hmm. the UI and Mobile links at the top go to stage.jqueryui.com and stage.jquerymobile.com
[13:58:13] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not seeing that.
[13:58:33] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I didn't realize api.jquery.com launched, going to work on a search shim now
[13:58:51] <scott_gonzalez> SURPRISE!
[13:59:06] <nacin> heh.
[13:59:18] <nacin> friggin' love that I don't need to be around for site launches.
[13:59:35] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: weird. everything is pointing to stage. for me. maybe there's something wacky with my hosts file?
[13:59:49] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[13:59:57] <scott_gonzalez> Do you still have an entry in there for api.jquery.com?
[14:00:03] <scott_gonzalez> If you do, you should remove it.
[14:00:13] <kswedberg> nah, I took it out.
[14:00:19] <kswedberg> do you know the command for dns flush off the top of you head? would that help?
[14:00:35] <nacin> dscacheutil ‚Äîflushcache
[14:00:47] <nacin> single hyphen
[14:00:47] <kswedberg> thanks, nacin!
[14:01:02] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: I have this in my .bash_profile: alias flushdns="dscacheutil -flushcache"
[14:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:01:12] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: I have one better: alias hosts='sudo vi /etc/hosts; dscacheutil -flushcache'
[14:01:23] <nacin> when you write and quit vim, it flushes the dns
[14:01:28] <kswedberg> nice.
[14:01:29] <scott_gonzalez> nice
[14:02:00] <nacin> I also have yours, mapped to `dns`, when chrome decides to be stupid and I need something to pass the time while it refreshes
[14:02:29] <scott_gonzalez> Oh man, Chrome does some crazy DNS caching, right?
[14:02:59] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: hmm. I have this line in my hosts file: 205.186.144.58 stage.api.jquery.com
[14:03:06] <kswedberg> could that be doing it?
[14:03:14] <scott_gonzalez> It shouldn't.
[14:03:32] <scott_gonzalez> Your hosts file will just change which IP gets resolved when navigating by name.
[14:05:30] <kswedberg> ugh. every link has a stage.* url
[14:05:37] <kswedberg> and i don't know why
[14:06:12] <scott_gonzalez> You're sure you're on api.jquery.com and not stage.api.jquery.com?
[14:09:59] <kswedberg> yes
[14:11:38] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: http://swedberg.us/i/stage.api.png
[14:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> weird
[14:12:26] <kswedberg> I guess if it's only happening to me, I shouldn't worry too much. but it is annoying. :/
[14:12:27] <scott_gonzalez> Your world is upside down.
[14:12:33] <kswedberg> indeed
[14:15:34] <kswedberg> just had a friend try it, and he's seeing stage.* too
[14:15:48] <kswedberg> (from the same office)
[14:16:05] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez ‚Üë
[14:16:16] <scott_gonzalez> hmm..
[14:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> Let me try from my phone using 3g.
[14:16:56] <kswedberg> k
[14:17:03] <kswedberg> i'll do the same
[14:17:25] <scott_gonzalez> I get proper URLs there.
[14:18:33] <kswedberg> yeah, so do I. huh.
[14:20:12] <kswedberg> now it's working. so weird
[14:20:50] <scott_gonzalez> I have no idea what was happening for you.
[14:20:57] <scott_gonzalez> But, I gotta go.
[14:21:25] <kswedberg> ok. well, thanks for being here for moral support. :) see ya.
[14:21:44] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[14:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> see ya
[14:27:00] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: will probably have code ready in a few for weighted searches
[14:38:48] <ajpiano> hmm something to fix on master https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues/199
[14:38:54] <ajpiano> i guess if you ship it, they will come :)
[14:56:41] <nacin> ajpiano: if I push something to web-base-template to master, does that go live, or just to stage?
[14:57:27] <ajpiano> just goes to stage
[14:57:38] <ajpiano> only goes live if we tag
[14:57:42] <ajpiano> i'm about to commit to master as well :p

[15:16:54] <ajpiano> nacin: you should see it on api.jquery.com right now
[15:19:37] <nacin> there's something weird going on with the on-the-fly search box
[15:20:02] <nacin> one, if you're on a search result page (?s=) it only filters visible results. which makes sense technically, but is kind of weird.
[15:20:20] <nacin> two, it seems to allow you to select text underneath. not sure if that's a chrome thing or something.
[15:20:38] <nacin> ajpiano: but it works, so woo
[15:44:00] <ajpiano> well there ya go
[15:44:11] <ajpiano> nacin: may as well file an issue to remember it
[15:44:20] <ajpiano> if you're so inclined
[16:05:42] <danheberden> ajpiano: you have things like local.jqueryui.com in your ServerName attr for apache, ya?
[16:05:49] <danheberden> instead of just *.local.jqueryui.com
[16:06:01] <danheberden> was gonna update the readme
[16:06:09] <ajpiano> i'm not sure, let me just finish this up
[16:06:15] <ajpiano> oh yea there's one other thing for the readme
