[04:22:29] <Guest88360> Hi, I followed this doc : http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/ and did not succeed to make my plugin appear. I enabled the GitHub jQuery Plugins service, I pushed yesterday my tag and it is ok on https://www.npmjs.com/package/vicopo and https://github.com/kylekatarnls/vicopo but I do not find my plugin on http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=vicopo, Someone know why? Thanks.
[17:04:24] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi. As stated on the website, the jQuery Plugin Registry is in read-only mode.
[17:04:24] <AurelioDeRosa> New plugin releases will not be processed. You should publish your plugins on npm
[17:04:31] <AurelioDeRosa> We recommend moving to npm, using "jquery-plugin" as the keyword in your package.json. The npm blog has instructions for publishing your plugin to npm.
