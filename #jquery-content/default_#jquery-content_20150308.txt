[05:26:11] <sigorilla> Hi! I think that is the wrong selection of current references in the menu. Should be highlighted only link `jQuery UI`.
[05:26:24] <sigorilla> Also nothing is highlighted under `Widget Factory` or `Using jQuery UI`.
[05:26:51] <arthurvr> sigorilla: Where are we talking about? (link?)
[05:26:52] <sigorilla> There is same situation in other links with submenu (`Using jQuery Core` and `Code Organization`).
[05:27:00] <arthurvr> learning center?
[05:27:15] <sigorilla> link in menu. Yes, learning center
[05:28:00] <sigorilla> Or it's issue for jquery-wp-content?
[05:28:56] <arthurvr> What do you mean with ‚Äùselection of current references in the menu‚Äù. You mean the chapters sidebar?
[05:29:07] <sigorilla> Yes
[05:29:44] <sigorilla> For example: http://goo.gl/xaPvwx
[05:30:04] <arthurvr> Hmm‚Ä¶ yeah you might be right :)
[05:30:56] <arthurvr> Can you open an issue? I think the issue is in jquery-wp-content.
[05:31:12] <arthurvr> (of course, a PR is welcome too :))
[05:33:02] <sigorilla> Do I need to open a issue, if I can immediately create a PR?
[05:33:55] <arthurvr> If you know how to fix this the right way, PR welcome!
[05:34:12] <arthurvr> sigorilla: be sure to read http://contribute.jquery.org/commits-and-pull-requests/ and http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/
[05:34:25] <sigorilla> without issue? right?
[05:35:28] <arthurvr> With an issue is the prefered way I guess, but if it‚Äôs a nasty thingy feel free to just PR.
[05:36:10] <sigorilla> Ok
[05:36:35] <arthurvr> sigorilla: you singed our cla yet?
[05:36:42] <arthurvr> http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/
[05:37:13] <sigorilla> Yes, I did.
[05:37:24] <arthurvr> sigorilla: thanks

[06:28:44] <sigorilla> arthurvr, I open PR. Thank you for your help.
[06:29:59] <arthurvr> sigorilla: thank you!
[07:28:01] <sigorilla> arthurvr, I have one more question about learn.jquery.com. If I follow the link /a/, then get /about/. This happens with other links (ex. /jque/ => /ajax/jquery-ajax-methods/, etc.) Is it a bug or a feature? :)
[07:29:12] <arthurvr> dunno :)
[07:30:05] <sigorilla> Okay ;)
