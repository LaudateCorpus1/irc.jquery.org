[02:08:04] <phpfluesterer> hi guys!
[02:08:25] <phpfluesterer> i have trouble adding my jQuery.Websocket plugin to the new registry ... https://github.com/clickalicious/jQuery.WebSocket
[02:09:42] <phpfluesterer> i've added the manifest file, checked its syntax for valid json, added the hook, tested it more than once, plugin won't show up in Registry search or overview ...
[02:23:59] <gnarf> phpfluesterer: lemme take a look quick
[02:24:27] <gnarf> Manifest errors: github/clickalicious/jQuery.WebSocket 0.0.2 Websocket.jquery.json [ 'Manifest version (0.0.1) does not match tag (0.0.2).' ] 
[02:24:59] <gnarf> phpfluesterer: bump the version to 0.0.3 and push a new tag
[02:25:02] <gnarf> and it should go
[02:25:12] <phpfluesterer> ok thx - let me try this ...
[02:25:28] <phpfluesterer> will be back for feedback in approx 5 -10 min
[02:27:10] <gnarf> ajpiano: if the next one also messes up, i'll dig into it more
[02:27:19] <gnarf> quick check tho
[02:27:21] <gnarf> seems okay
[02:32:17] <ajpiano> gnarf: next plugin or next contrib deploy
[02:32:23] <ajpiano> either way we can look at it i guess :p
[02:32:30] <gnarf> crontrib
[02:32:39] <ajpiano> gnarf: i don't think local.irc.jquery.org is setup in DNS
[02:32:55] <gnarf> ajpiano: it might not be
[02:33:03] <ajpiano> also i just pushed to irc.jquery.org , it didn't come in hre
[02:33:22] <gnarf> thats all github's fault
[02:33:43] <ajpiano> yea i wasn't sure
[02:34:15] <ajpiano> hummm gnarf
[02:34:18] <ajpiano> same error just happend
[02:34:20] <ajpiano> with check modules
[02:34:22] <ajpiano> this time on irc
[02:34:25] <gnarf> hrm
[02:34:48] <gnarf> no when on console tho
[02:34:50] <gnarf> ....
[02:35:07] <ajpiano> seem like something is a litle messed up with the deps on the machine that's doing the deploy automatically
[02:35:39] <gnarf> o wait
[02:35:41] <gnarf> stage
[02:35:45] <ajpiano> yea
[02:36:11] <ajpiano> i'm gonna deploy manually and go to sleep wasn't expecting to be up this late
[02:39:38] <ajpiano> woo hoo http://stage.irc.jquery.org/irc-help/
[02:39:53] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i still have most of the blog post left to write, will pick it back up in the AM
[02:39:55] <ajpiano> well i guess this is the AM
[02:40:01] <ajpiano> gnite gnarf
[02:40:03] <ajpiano> :)
[02:56:33] <phpfluesterer> gnite
[02:59:30] <phpfluesterer> changed version within the manifest file (Websocket.jquery.json) to 0.0.3 and tagged the current state in github as 0.0.3 ... tried to trigger (Test) the URL-hook manually ... still the same result = no result :/ - anyone any idea?
[02:59:47] <jqcommit> [13learn.jquery.com] 15selwyn opened pull request #215: Corrected minor typos on Arrays page (06master...06master)  02http://git.io/Di3Cqw
[03:04:56] <phpfluesterer> maybe a site/page where the result of commit-hooks are viewable would be a helpful tool for plugin-devs?!  Also an additional layer of checking in your commit-hook - which checks the tag of the repository against the version in the manifest file and in case of an error: sending an email to the contributor(s) (also taken from manifest) 
[03:21:51] <phpfluesterer> everythings fine. plugin is now listed. thank you! bye

[03:43:42] <phpfluesterer> oh :) havnt seen this issue ... so maybe i should have asked: why is this still open? :p
[04:01:59] <scott_gonzalez> I only have so much time.
[04:04:08] <scott_gonzalez> OH MAN! I FOUND THE BLACKHOLE!
[04:04:22] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano gnarf: People have BOMs in their manfiests.
[04:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> And it's killing JSON.parse().
[04:04:28] <diegolima> Scott, good morning! I developed this plugin: "https://github.com/DiegoLopesLima/Validate". I followed the tutorial to post but did not work ... And I can not create a new tag just to publish ... : ( ... Could you help me?
[04:04:57] <scott_gonzalez> Hey diegolima, let me just get this fix to production and then I'll check the logs for you.
[04:06:27] <diegolima> Thanks!

[04:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, let me see what's going on with your plugin.
[04:08:02] <scott_gonzalez> Manifest errors: github/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine 0.1.0 jQuery-Validation-Engine.jquery.json [ 'Name contains invalid characters.',   'Manifest version (2.6.2) does not match tag (0.1.0).' ]
[04:08:33] <scott_gonzalez> Your name can't contain spaces.
[04:08:58] <scott_gonzalez> Also, the name and filename don't match.
[04:09:03] <scott_gonzalez> for 2.6.2
[04:09:13] <scott_gonzalez> diegolima: ^
[04:11:42] <diegolima> Is case sensitive? "validate" != "Validate"??
[04:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> diegolima: Sorry, I was looking at the wrong plugin. Someone else was trying to publish a validation plugin as well.
[04:12:58] <scott_gonzalez> But, yes, right now it is case sensitive.
[04:13:02] <scott_gonzalez> We have an issue open for that.
[04:13:09] <scott_gonzalez> Let me find the correct logs (sorry about that).
[04:14:24] <deefour> I'm looking for some help as to why https://github.com/deefour/colorband isn't getting picked up by the new plugins.jquery.com. I believe I've set everything up properly
[04:14:28] <diegolima> rlx ^^
[04:14:39] <scott_gonzalez> diegolima: Do you happen to know if you have a BOM in your manifest?
[04:15:58] <scott_gonzalez> deefour: Manifest errors: github/deefour/ColorBand 1.4.2 colorband.jquery.json [ 'Manifest version (1.4.1) does not match tag (1.4.2).' ]
[04:16:01] <scott_gonzalez> You can't retag.
[04:16:12] <scott_gonzalez> The plugins iste will only process a tag once, based on name.
[04:16:55] <deefour> scott_gonzalez: I can fix it by pushing a new tag for a new HEAD commit?
[04:17:13] <scott_gonzalez> deefour: Yes, but the tag name cannot match the name of a tag that was already processed.
[04:17:37] <deefour> scott_gonzalez: thanks i'll try that now
[04:17:43] <scott_gonzalez> So you can use v1.4.2 if you don't want to change version numbers.
[04:17:51] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise, you'll need to switch to 1.4.2-1 or 1.4.3
[04:19:28] <scott_gonzalez> deefour: It should process in a few seconds.
[04:19:34] <diegolima> I did not ... Sorry, my English is bad ^^ You want me to create a new tag?
[04:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> diegolima: Did not what?
[04:20:41] <scott_gonzalez> You don't know if it has a BOM?
[04:20:49] <scott_gonzalez> I can clone your repo and check.
[04:22:24] <diegolima> I do not know...
[04:22:38] <scott_gonzalez> deefour: Do me a favor and press the test hook button.
[04:22:43] <scott_gonzalez> diegolima: Ok, I'll check.
[04:22:44] <deefour> scott_gonzalez: doing
[04:23:17] <scott_gonzalez> deefour: published :-)
[04:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> This GitHub timing issue is killing us.
[04:23:36] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub is sending the post-receive hook before the tag is available to fetch.
[04:23:53] <deefour> http://plugins.jquery.com/colorband/  Thank you!!
[04:26:01] <deefour> scott_gonzalez: I love the idea of the plugin site being updated through the post-receive hook and wish you luck getting the timing sorted out. Thanks for the help!
[04:26:11] <scott_gonzalez> diegolima: It doesn't have a BOM, so that wasn't the problem.
[04:26:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'll keep digging.
[04:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> deefour: Thanks, it'll get even better over time.
[04:27:17] <scott_gonzalez> diegolima: 1.1.0 and 1.1.1 posted fine for me locally.
[04:27:32] <scott_gonzalez> Did you re-tag at all or are these the original tags?
[04:30:28] <diegolima> Is the orginal...
[04:40:07] <scott_gonzalez> diegolima: Can you press the test hook button?
[04:41:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why 1.1.0 didn't get posted.
[04:41:14] <scott_gonzalez> But it hasn't tried to process 1.1.1 yet.
[04:50:12] <diegolima> :(
[04:52:28] <scott_gonzalez> Can you please press the test hook button?
[04:54:36] <diegolima> I do not know what is the test hook button... I did not understand ... oO'
[04:56:15] <scott_gonzalez> Where you added the web hook.
[04:56:21] <scott_gonzalez> There is a button to test the web hook.
[04:57:31] <diegolima> Ok.
[04:58:10] <diegolima> Ready...
[04:58:33] <scott_gonzalez> That worked.
[04:58:44] <scott_gonzalez> I'm still not sure what was going on with 1.1.0.
[05:00:45] <sapegin> Hello! Is there any way to know why my plugin hasn‚Äôt been published?
[05:01:23] <sapegin> Sorry, I see it! After 20 minutes and few clicks on Test Hook button :-)
[05:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> sapegin: Which repo?
[05:35:13] <diegolima> :-/
[05:35:59] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: you handeling the email from valums/ ?
[05:36:26] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: yea
[05:36:37] <gnarf> was just gonna do it but saw you active
[05:38:36] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: Any progress on temp.blog.jquery.com/wp-admin?
[05:41:19] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: looking again now
[05:43:17] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: now?
[05:43:44] <scott_gonzalez> That works.
[05:43:51] <scott_gonzalez> Now let's see about this theme...
[05:45:10] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: There's no wp-config.php in the root, how does this work?
[05:45:38] <gnarf> it's in htdocs?
[05:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> I'm looking in /var/www/temp....
[05:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> The config is loaded from somewhere else?
[05:46:28] <gnarf> root@eol1:/var/www/temp.blog.jquery.com/htdocs# ls -al wp-config.php 
[05:46:28] <gnarf> -rw-r--r-- 1 www-data www-data 2650 Jan 17 22:20 wp-config.php
[05:46:40] <gnarf> are you tabbing and breaking cuz the -sample is still there?
[05:46:50] <scott_gonzalez> Ohhh...
[05:47:05] <scott_gonzalez> There are two copies of WordPress apparently.
[05:47:15] <scott_gonzalez> One in /temp... and one in /temp.../htdocs.
[05:47:43] <scott_gonzalez> Moving to htdocs fixed this.
[05:47:57] <scott_gonzalez> BAM! http://temp.blog.jquery.com/
[05:48:15] <scott_gonzalez> Missing the logo, but it's looking pretty good.
[05:48:45] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks gnarf.
[05:48:55] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano and danheberden will be happy.
[05:51:53] <diegolima> Do not know what to do ... :-/
[05:52:54] <gnarf> diegolima: ?
[05:53:49] <diegolima> √â com o Scott ^^... Sorry
[05:54:08] <gnarf> diegolima: can you repeat the problem for me?
[05:55:19] <diegolima> Ok... J√° tentei de tudo para publicar o meu plugin: "https://github.com/DiegoLopesLima/Validate" Mas n√£o funciona...
[05:55:53] <diegolima> Ok .. I've tried everything to publish my plugin: "https://github.com/DiegoLopesLima/Validate" But it does not work ...
[05:56:40] <gnarf> http://plugins.jquery.com/validate/ ?
[05:57:43] <diegolima> Yes..
[05:57:54] <gnarf> seems published?

[06:06:04] <diegolima> Here on my network, I tested it on 3 computers and still nothing oO '...
[06:08:31] <gnarf> check the response headers?
[06:22:45] <gnarf> afk a bit
[06:22:51] <gnarf> maybe most of the morning
[06:25:52] <jqcommit> [13api.jquery.com] 15djekl opened issue #226: Syntax error in .each() example  02http://git.io/a4yh1Q
[06:57:54] <Aamir> plz help http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-plugin-is-not-appearing-on-the-new-plugin-website
[07:12:20] <Gavrisimo> hey guys, I have followed the steps here: http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/ but my plugin is still not visible
[07:12:50] <Gavrisimo> here is my gh repo: https://github.com/Gavrisimo/toggler
[07:14:34] <Gavrisimo> I have added webhook, tagged it and pushed
[07:15:04] <Gavrisimo> also here is my manifest: https://github.com/Gavrisimo/toggler/blob/master/toggler.jquery.json
[07:15:50] <kborchers> Gavrisimo: i don't know how to tail the logs to see what went wrong
[07:15:56] <kborchers> rworth: scott_gonzalez ajpiano gnarf ^^^
[07:16:53] <Gavrisimo> it's really not that big of a deal, since this plugin is my testing ground :D
[07:16:59] <kborchers> Gavrisimo: also, did you try the Test Hook button?
[07:17:10] <Gavrisimo> yes, when I click it nothing happens O_O
[07:17:15] <rworth> the latest log says "No tags to process for github/Gavrisimo/toggler"
[07:17:27] <rworth> so it may be a timing issue
[07:19:01] <Gavrisimo> rworth ok i bumped up the version and pushed... :) let's see if it works
[07:19:31] <rworth> you need to bump the version in the manifest file as well, not just the tag
[07:19:37] <rworth> they have to match for it to work
[07:19:45] <Gavrisimo> ah
[07:19:45] <Gavrisimo> ok
[07:19:52] <rworth> Manifest errors: github/Gavrisimo/toggler 0.0.2 toggler.jquery.json [ 'Manifest version (0.0.1) does not match tag (0.0.2).',   'Invalid version range for dependency: jquery.' ]
[07:20:05] <rworth> note there's another error there. You'll want to address that at the same time
[07:21:14] <Gavrisimo> I just pushed the updated manifest
[07:21:18] <Gavrisimo> they are now in sync
[07:23:38] <rworth> they don't and they can't. the 0.0.2 tag will forever have 0.0.1 in the manifest. You need to bump to 0.0.3 in the manifest, correct the 'Invalid version range for dependency: jquery' then tag 0.0.3
[07:24:46] <Gavrisimo> riiiight :) do something, update manifest, push it, then tag it
[07:24:49] <Gavrisimo> thanks man
[07:24:54] <rworth> np
[07:32:21] <scott_gonzalez> Let me tell you how surprised I am that this is still an issue for me sometimes: http://cl.ly/image/2U1s193n1d3t
[07:32:53] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing makes development more fun than waiting 13 seconds for a stupid font to load.
[07:33:42] <Gavrisimo> waiting 14 seconds does
[07:33:44] <Gavrisimo> :D
[07:34:04] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:34:45] <scott_gonzalez> How about 34 seconds? :-P https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/57
[07:34:45] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, issue #57 by scottgonzalez (5mon 9h ago): Remove dependency on typekit.com
[07:35:12] <scott_gonzalez> 36 even
[07:37:51] <Gavrisimo> rworth ok, my last cry for help today :) https://github.com/Gavrisimo/toggler/tree/0.0.3 has correct update in manifest
[07:37:59] <diegolima> scott_gonzalez: Yet it seems that my plugin was not published ... Is it normal? http://plugins.jquery.com/validate
[07:38:26] <scott_gonzalez> diegolima: I don't know what you wnat us to tell you. It's there. gnarf even proved it to you.
[07:38:53] <scott_gonzalez> It's clearly an issue on your side.
[07:39:02] <rworth> I'm getting a 404 for /validate
[07:39:19] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: What do your headers say?
[07:39:39] <scott_gonzalez> scroll up a bit and see gnarf's screenshot.
[07:40:33] <scott_gonzalez> I don't know how you 2 can be getting 404s.
[07:40:43] <diegolima> scott_gonzalez: Sorry ... Is that anywhere I try to access, even outside of my network, does not appear ...
[07:42:10] <rworth> http://i.imgur.com/3hZgE.png
[07:43:11] <rworth> Gavrisimo last time the server got a ping from GitHub about your repo was 10min ago and at that time reported "No tags to process"
[07:43:22] <rworth> maybe try the hook test button again?
[07:44:32] <rworth> Gavrisimo Manifest errors: github/Gavrisimo/toggler 0.0.3 toggler.jquery.json [ 'Invalid version range for dependency: jquery.' ]
[07:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> rworth diegolima: I have no idea how to debug that.
[07:45:02] <Gavrisimo> ah it's using default grunt.js value -> *
[07:45:02] <rworth> your dependencies is unchanged since 0.0.1 and 0.0.2
[07:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> Gavrisimo: We don't support * right now. We have an issue filed for it.
[07:45:56] <Gavrisimo> ok so "jquery": "1.8.3" should fix it
[07:45:56] <Gavrisimo> ?
[07:46:09] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but you should list a real range.
[07:46:24] <scott_gonzalez> Like >1.8 or >1.6.
[07:46:30] <rworth> just got the same validate 404 in Firefox and Safari. Perhaps a proxy/caching issue?
[07:46:33] <scott_gonzalez> Well, probably >=
[07:46:50] <Gavrisimo> scott_gonzalez: "jquery": ">=1.8"
[07:47:00] <Gavrisimo> that should work?
[07:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah
[07:47:10] <scott_gonzalez> Do you actually require 1.8?
[07:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, the field should be accurate.
[07:47:37] <Gavrisimo> I really don't know, just started working on this :)
[07:47:55] <Gavrisimo> I started on 1.8.3 I guess, but now we have 1.9
[07:48:08] <Gavrisimo> didn't test any version before 1.8.3
[07:48:13] <scott_gonzalez> So >= 1.8 is probably safe.
[07:48:17] <Gavrisimo> great
[07:48:33] <edgarjs> hello, it's been a day since I pushed to my repository to publish a plugin, but it still doesn't appear in the plugins site. How can I know if it was received or there was an error?
[07:49:51] <Gavrisimo> ok, I have updated dependencies to "jquery": ">=1.8" then pushed it, then tagged it, then pushed tags
[07:49:56] <Gavrisimo> let's see if this works
[07:49:59] <rworth> edgarjs what's the repo url ?
[07:50:13] <edgarjs> https://github.com/edgarjs/jquery-deserialize
[07:50:50] <aknosis> I'm having issues publishing a plugin, can anyone offer some insight into what might be wrong? 
[07:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> aknosis: repo?
[07:51:01] <aknosis> [ https://github.com/aknosis/jquery-pluginifier ]
[07:51:39] <scott_gonzalez> It was added.
[07:51:53] <scott_gonzalez> http://plugins.jquery.com/pluginifier/
[07:51:55] <rworth> edgarjs try hitting the test hook button
[07:52:20] <aknosis> aww looks like i was searching on tags and it didn't show up
[07:52:23] <aknosis> #fail
[07:52:23] <edgarjs> rworth: nothing happends
[07:52:48] <rworth> edgarjs it's happening Found manifest files for github/edgarjs/jquery-deserialize 1.0.1 [ 'deserialize.jquery.json' ]
[07:52:55] <rworth> Done processing request: github/edgarjs/jquery-deserialize
[07:53:14] <rworth> http://plugins.jquery.com/deserialize/
[07:53:29] <edgarjs> uhm, I also hit the button yesterday
[07:53:33] <edgarjs> well thank you
[07:53:56] <rworth> there is a bit of a delay between when the tag is there and it is picked up by the hook, it seems
[07:53:57] <rworth> np
[07:54:01] <Gavrisimo> how long does it take for a plugin to show up on site after pushing tag to repo?
[07:54:15] <rworth> Gavrisimo just happened for edgarjs in under a min
[07:54:30] <rworth> as you can see by the last 10 messages
[07:54:32] <Gavrisimo> ok, so I must be doing something wrong again... >.<
[07:54:33] <edgarjs> yes, like instant
[07:55:00] <rworth> Gavrisimo Manifest errors: github/Gavrisimo/toggler 0.0.4 toggler.jquery.json [ 'Manifest version (0.0.3) does not match tag (0.0.4).' ]
[07:55:49] <Gavrisimo> oh cmon :D
[07:56:00] <Gavrisimo> ok, it's friday, 17h... that's who to blame :D
[07:56:10] <rworth> :) Some lessons you need to learn more than once
[07:56:29] <Gavrisimo> yeah, I never used tags before this
[07:57:20] <edgarjs> in the author section of the plugin page, there's a placeholder for the image. where does it take that from?
[07:57:36] <rworth> gravatar
[07:57:47] <edgarjs> oh so I must provide an email then
[07:57:52] <rworth> yup
[07:58:35] <edgarjs> if I do changes like that in the manifest, I don't think I should update the version of the plugin right?
[07:58:49] <edgarjs> but will the site update the page even if it's the same version?
[07:58:54] <rworth> you have to in order to publish a new tag
[07:59:02] <edgarjs> I see
[07:59:03] <rworth> no, the same tag will never be processed again
[08:00:10] <Gavrisimo> ok, I promise this is last time today I ask for help... :D what does server logs say now?
[08:00:38] <Gavrisimo> ofc I fucked up commit message now haha... but that shouldn't metter i hope :D
[08:07:24] <Gavrisimo> omg it workd
[08:07:29] <Gavrisimo> worked*
[08:07:29] <Gavrisimo> http://plugins.jquery.com/toggler/
[08:07:36] <Gavrisimo> woooo
[08:07:45] <Gavrisimo> thanks for the effort guys
[08:07:47] <Gavrisimo> <3
[08:07:53] <rworth> \o/
[08:12:22] <rworth> scott_gonzalez can we reasonably add something like a 1min delay between when we get the hook and we clone the repo. Seems a lot of people are having to hit the test hook button
[08:12:35] <scott_gonzalez> There's a 20 second delay.
[08:12:49] <rworth> hmm
[08:13:07] <scott_gonzalez> GitHub is ridiculous.
[08:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Is it possible to hook into body_class() from inside a theme?
[08:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> Or does it have to be in a plugin?
[08:18:46] <nacin> add_filter( 'body_class', function( $classes ) { $classes[] = 'new-class'; } );
[08:19:24] <nacin> return $classes;
[08:20:02] <scott_gonzalez> Ugh, I'm an idiot.
[08:20:20] <scott_gonzalez> I had the filter, but was returning a string.

[08:40:05] <AaronLasseigne> After pushing a tag on a plugin to github, what's a reasonble amount of time before he plugin should display on the site? (I pushed about an hour ago.)
[08:40:43] <scott_gonzalez> AaronLasseigne: 1 minute.
[08:40:46] <scott_gonzalez> Which repo?
[08:41:06] <AaronLasseigne> https://github.com/orgsync/jquery-aria
[08:41:35] <AaronLasseigne> I email you about this last night (thanks for the response). I had a stray comma in my manifest.
[08:41:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's added.
[08:41:58] <scott_gonzalez> http://plugins.jquery.com/aria/
[08:42:37] <AaronLasseigne> Arg, my bad. Thanks.
[08:42:42] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[08:45:22] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: You around?
[08:48:38] <diegolima> scott_gonzalez: I could see ... But he only got version 1.1.0 and not 1.1.1 ... And he took Algus wrong data, because I had recently changed the name of the repository, and took the old name ... You can remove it for everything I nva manages a tag to fix this?
[08:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> diegolima: It has 1.1.0 and 1.1.1
[08:51:26] <scott_gonzalez> If the data is wrong, then it's wrong.
[08:51:32] <scott_gonzalez> We can't do anything about that right now.
[08:51:50] <scott_gonzalez> You can list the repo + versions you want removed here: http://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/88
[08:51:50] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez, issue #88 by STAR-ZERO (1d 1h ago): How to remove plugin
[08:57:22] <diegolima> scott_gonzalez: "https://github.com/DiegoLopesLima/Validate/blob/master/validate.jquery.json" But the file is correct, and it is not ... As part of the file is correct and partly wrong ... :/
[08:59:47] <diegolima> https://raw.github.com/DiegoLopesLima/Validate/master/validate.jquery.json
[09:03:52] <scott_gonzalez> I don't understand what I'm looking at.
[09:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> Can you speak in specifics?
[09:04:18] <scott_gonzalez> Instead of "But the file is corerct, and it is not"
[09:08:27] <diegolima> scott_gonzalez: On the "http://plugins.jquery.com/validate/1.1.0/", the link to the documentation is as follows: "https://github.com/DiegoLopesLima/jQuery-Validate # readme" ... But in "https://raw.github.com/DiegoLopesLima/Validate/master/validate.jquery.json" is correct ... Thus: "https://github.com/DiegoLopesLima/Validate # readme" ...
[09:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> There's nothing we can do about that.
[09:09:00] <scott_gonzalez> Nobody is going to lok at 1.1.0 anyway.
[09:11:22] <diegolima> scott_gonzalez: Yes, but 1.1.1 is not coming ...
[09:13:03] <scott_gonzalez> It's already there.
[09:13:10] <scott_gonzalez> You must have something caching the content.
[09:14:29] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: creating a proxy to trigger the downloading of a file is fairly easy to do, fyi.
[09:14:37] <nacin> even if that file is not hosted.
[09:18:19] <diegolima> scott_gonzalez: Already cleared my cache and also went to the phone and other computers that I had not yet entered ... But it does not open ... Returns "It Seems we can not find what you're looking for."
[09:25:04] <diegolima> scott_gonzalez: Anyway thank you for your attention! Se eu criar uma nova tag, pode ser que arrume?
[09:25:26] <diegolima> scott_gonzalez: If I create a new tag, which can be arrange?

[09:26:50] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano danheberden: I'm stepping out for a bit. But I've got the blog theme ready to go, and there's a pretty clean upgrade path for jquery-wp-content changes.
[09:27:06] <ajpiano> sounds good
[09:27:17] <ajpiano> is it actually at temp.blog.jquery.com
[09:27:20] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, you're here.
[09:27:22] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[09:27:27] <ajpiano> yeah i just recently surfaced
[09:27:33] <ajpiano> that url ain't working for me
[09:27:46] <scott_gonzalez> 216.70.110.52 temp.blog.jquery.com
[09:27:49] <ajpiano> i wonder if i have so
[09:27:49] <ajpiano> yea
[09:29:07] <ajpiano> looks pretty good scott_gonzalez !
[09:29:10] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[09:29:26] <scott_gonzalez> I have blog.jqueryui.com running off of the new code too.
[09:29:29] <ajpiano> hey now i donno
[09:29:33] <ajpiano> having working archive links?
[09:29:46] <ajpiano> i thought the goal of our blog was to have less recent posts disappear off the face of the earth
[09:29:53] <ajpiano> completley inaccessible unless you know what to google for
[09:29:57] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:30:09] <scott_gonzalez> That drives me nuts.
[09:30:17] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: should i author the post in this wordpress, then?
[09:30:31] <scott_gonzalez> Author it in production.
[09:30:37] <ajpiano> k
[09:30:40] <ajpiano> we'll just move it over after
[09:30:50] <scott_gonzalez> This is literally a copy of production with a different theme in use.
[09:31:00] <ajpiano> oh we'lll just move the theme onto production
[09:31:01] <ajpiano> duhhhh
[09:31:13] <scott_gonzalez> So when we're ready, I'll just switch the theme in production.
[09:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:31:24] <scott_gonzalez> There we go again with the dual typing.
[09:31:34] <scott_gonzalez> This time you beat me though :-)
[09:31:41] <ajpiano> hehee
[09:32:08] <scott_gonzalez> How's jquery.com coming along?
[09:32:57] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like it still needs some work.
[09:33:59] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps we should use .text() in the ajax example.
[09:34:39] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, gonna go run an errand.
[09:34:43] <scott_gonzalez> I'll be back in a bit.
[09:37:06] <ajpiano> haven't had a chance to look at .com yet
[10:01:01] <scott_gonzalez> back
[10:04:51] <ajpiano> rad
[10:07:22] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i don't suppose you feel like dropping 1.9.0 into jquery-wp-content and double checking that everything is kosher
[10:08:00] <scott_gonzalez> Sure.
[10:08:12] <scott_gonzalez> The stuff in UI that's gonna break is already broken :-P
[10:08:21] <scott_gonzalez> So how much harm can it really do?
[10:09:45] <ajpiano> yeah
[10:10:13] <scott_gonzalez> ruhroh
[10:10:18] <scott_gonzalez> Something's using .live()
[10:10:39] <scott_gonzalez> I'll go through all the sites and see how much needs to change.
[10:10:47] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: that's what i had a feeling about
[10:10:57] <ajpiano> just in my gu
[10:10:58] <ajpiano> gut
[10:11:05] <scott_gonzalez> It's colorbox.
[10:11:42] <scott_gonzalez> And FlexSlider.
[10:11:57] <scott_gonzalez> So, code we shouldn't be touching.
[10:12:19] <ajpiano> where are we actually using flexslider?
[10:12:53] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: we could put in 1.9.0 with migrate?
[10:13:27] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, we can. Which will more people file issues for? Using 1.8.3 or having migrate warnings?
[10:13:37] <ajpiano> can't we turn off the warnings
[10:13:47] <scott_gonzalez> I dunno, I've never used it :-P
[10:13:56] <scott_gonzalez> But probably.
[10:14:16] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i mostly want it because i have a sentence in here talking about how the sites got harder to manage over the time
[10:14:26] <ajpiano> and that we had 1.4.2 on jquery.com for the longest time
[10:14:29] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:14:43] <ajpiano> "Today, we are happy to announce that we're finally up to jQuey 1.8.3" doesn't quite have the same ring to it :p
[10:15:14] <scott_gonzalez> Who is the slacker that doesn't update code.jquery.com index.html?
[10:15:17] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: ^
[10:15:37] <DaveMethvin> yeah that would be me
[10:15:41] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/0n2B191Y2p33
[10:15:53] <scott_gonzalez> I think something might be missing there ;-)
[10:16:08] <DaveMethvin> didn't we have a todo to generate that automatically?
[10:16:23] <scott_gonzalez> We do.
[10:16:29] <scott_gonzalez> We have lots of todos.
[10:16:38] <DaveMethvin> maybe we should turn directory browsing on for it. DUN
[10:16:49] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[10:16:50] <DaveMethvin> i gotta add the map file too
[10:16:54] <DaveMethvin> and the migrate plugin
[10:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> I feel like we should do the dual loading thing with conditional comments.
[10:18:23] <DaveMethvin> what, on the jquery sites?
[10:18:34] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:18:36] <DaveMethvin> we could
[10:18:48] <DaveMethvin> once 2.0 ships
[10:18:54] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> No, we should dual load the git versions :-)
[10:19:17] <DaveMethvin> is code.jquery.com the only place where we keep the laundry list of files now?
[10:19:29] <DaveMethvin> used to be in at least 2 places
[10:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> It's the only place I update, besides jqueryui.com.
[10:21:02] <DaveMethvin> so good, the docs.jquery.com downlod redirects now
[10:21:35] <DaveMethvin> but the ui docs are still live there, for 1.8
[10:21:38] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, ajpiano: The answer to "can't we turn off the warnings" is "Yes, we can load the minfiied version".
[10:21:47] <ajpiano> i think i knew that
[10:21:56] <DaveMethvin> it says that in about 10 places all over the docs and blogs
[10:22:10] <DaveMethvin> you can also set a variable
[10:22:17] <scott_gonzalez> DaveMethvin: I may be illiterate.
[10:22:42] <jack__> Oh hey, I wrote colorbox.  Live has been removed.
[10:22:58] <scott_gonzalez> jack__: Is there a new release or just in master?
[10:23:16] <scott_gonzalez> We should probably go through all the plugins we're using and make sure we have the latest versions.
[10:23:19] <jack__> There is a release for it.  I think it's been out for a while, but I can't remember.
[10:23:52] <jack__> It was in Nov.
[10:24:07] <danheberden> hey guys, just checking in
[10:24:16] <danheberden> since i'm awake/at-the-compy/etc
[10:24:17] <scott_gonzalez> Cool, I'll pull in the new version.
[10:24:25] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: I have the blog done :-)
[10:24:49] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: OH NICE!
[10:25:03] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: can i see?
[10:25:09] <danheberden> stage.blog.jquery.com is empty
[10:25:25] <scott_gonzalez> 216.70.110.52 temp.blog.jquery.com
[10:25:39] <danheberden> also, my computer took a crap so i missed any feedback about the buttons that i asked about earlier
[10:26:19] <danheberden> namely http://danheberden.com/share/93a4.png
[10:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> I think a download box like http://jqueryui.com/ would look good.
[10:27:05] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: shit
[10:27:08] <danheberden> you got them ALL done
[10:27:10] <danheberden> ?!
[10:27:14] <danheberden> like - consolidated?
[10:27:27] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: No, it's just a theme for the current production site on eol.
[10:27:37] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: i'm sorry if you designed that, but i think that box looks absolutely awful
[10:27:56] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: love the blog man
[10:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> I didn't design it.
[10:28:01] <danheberden> so much nicer to read
[10:28:11] <danheberden> not to mention looking so much sexier
[10:28:14] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think it looks awful, but I'm fine changing it.
[10:28:19] <ajpiano> danheberden: i don't think the jqueryui.com one looks great
[10:28:25] <scott_gonzalez> I was able to pull in jquery-wp-content is a pretty sane way.
[10:28:31] <ajpiano> but consistency would be nice
[10:28:39] <ajpiano> also the current jquery.com just looks a little unfinished
[10:28:46] <ajpiano> download area
[10:28:48] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Consistency would be nice, but UI can change to be consistent.
[10:28:52] <ajpiano> that too
[10:28:55] <danheberden> ajpiano: yeah - i'm working on the jq.com portion 
[10:29:04] <ajpiano> sweet, so we can port whatever dan does there back to ui
[10:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, if we have another deisgn to go with, we shouldn't let what's currently on ui hold us up.
[10:29:13] <ajpiano> porablem solved
[10:29:20] <ajpiano> man remember we used to talk about things like this for WEEKS
[10:29:25] <scott_gonzalez> It'll take like 2 minutes to change.
[10:30:18] <danheberden> ajpiano: scott_gonzalez: the future is pretty damn cool
[10:30:25] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[10:32:28] <scott_gonzalez> FlexSlider has 243 open issues.
[10:32:39] <scott_gonzalez> That seems crazy high for a single plugin.
[10:34:18] <danheberden> "does not flex enough when sliding"
[10:34:27] <danheberden> "this slider doesn't work with Flex 4.0"
[10:34:53] <danheberden> "slider is constantly flexing and pointing the way to the beach"
[10:35:02] <jacklmoore> This is literally the newest issue opened for it: "first post, My Gosssh, what should I do here??"
[10:35:04] <danheberden> i'm here all week folks
[10:35:19] <danheberden> jacklmoore: posts like that make me want to shake an infant
[10:35:24] <DaveMethvin> lol
[10:36:31] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez: new blog looks nice! should probably get rid of the Uncategorized category, though. ;)
[10:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: It's just showing whatever's in the database.
[10:37:00] <kswedberg> k
[10:37:04] <scott_gonzalez> It's probably from the clone.
[10:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> Nope, there's an Uncategorized in production too.
[10:38:09] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we just don't show the categories on the current site.
[10:38:43] <scott_gonzalez> Is there an option to have WordPress just skip over it?
[10:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> wp_list_categories()
[10:39:08] <scott_gonzalez> Is what's creating the list.
[10:39:41] <DaveMethvin> $("li:contains(Uncategorized)").hide() :D
[10:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I think I found the real API for it.
[10:40:51] <DaveMethvin> hey, whatchoo sayin a "real API"?
[10:41:18] <danheberden> jquery or gtfo
[10:42:15] <DaveMethvin> seems like all those uncategorized should have been categorized, but since there's 184 of them, um, maybe another solution
[10:42:30] <DaveMethvin> including a bunch fromme
[10:42:59] * DaveMethvin makes a note to brush after every meal and categorize blog announcements
[10:43:29] <scott_gonzalez> gone
[10:43:31] <danheberden> rename uncategorized to general
[10:43:35] <kswedberg> If there in the jQuery blog, we should just change all the Uncategorized to jquery
[10:43:37] <danheberden> boom done, lol
[10:43:42] <kswedberg> oh well.
[10:44:35] <DaveMethvin> wow there's a draft from john about scriptaculous and jquery from jan 2011
[10:45:00] <DaveMethvin> let me get outa here before i waste more time
[10:45:28] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[10:48:50] <scott_gonzalez> Do we want to keep the live filtering functionality on the API sites?
[10:50:39] <kswedberg> sure, why not?
[10:51:12] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like we've gotten complaints about users getting confused because it's only filtering what's on the page.
[10:51:21] <scott_gonzalez> As opposed to showing results for what you've typed so far.
[10:51:49] <scott_gonzalez> And it seemed to make the most sense on the index page, which is going to change soon.
[10:52:04] <kswedberg> huh. like suddenly people are confused because we changed the design, even though the behavior has been that way for like 3 years?
[10:53:01] <scott_gonzalez> No, I remember hearing this before. I haven't heard it since we did the new design.
[10:53:15] <kswedberg> yeah, if we're getting rid of the list of methods on the index page, might as well kill it.
[10:54:21] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: are you talking about https://twitter.com/rpncreator/status/292303652536872960
[10:54:22] <b-ot> ajpiano, @rpncreator: @scott_gonzalez @ajpiano New #jquery API site looks great. Any chance that the autofiltering from the previous version will return?
[10:54:54] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, does it not even work?

[10:55:04] <kswedberg> you know, it would be really easy to implement an autosuggest if we had that json/p search api again. :p
[10:55:08] <scott_gonzalez> We're loading the code and it's not doing anything :-P
[10:55:30] <kswedberg> wat?
[10:55:30] <b-ot> How can i use this to select from which element the function was called?
[10:55:31] <ajpiano> HEY KSWEDBERG IF YOU DONT KEEP MUM ABOUT THAT IM GONNA WRAP YOU IN A FUNCTION CALL AND SEND YOUR PAYLOAD OVER THE WIRE
[10:56:01] <kswedberg> ajpiano: lolololol
[10:56:53] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, the code that calls .liveUpdate() is commented out.
[10:56:55] <kswedberg> it's probably not working because it's coupled to the old html markup. :/
[10:57:14] <kswedberg> whatever. 
[10:57:28] <kswedberg> just kill it then! SEE IF I CARE AJPIANO!

[10:58:29] <scott_gonzalez> It'd be nice to have a real search being performed like you're saying.
[10:58:43] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so I'll remove this since it's currently broken anyway.
[10:58:47] <scott_gonzalez> And we can do it for real later.

[11:04:20] <ajpiano> you could fix it by making the sidebar less...sidebar-y
[11:04:32] <ajpiano> so that the main content area can fall off to the left
[11:05:39] <danheberden> oh, the code samples stuff is pre-rendered

[12:39:01] <scott_gonzalez> We're trying to remove ids as much as possible.
[12:39:12] <scott_gonzalez> Our rules are getting out of control because ids exist.

[12:39:41] <danheberden> we risk conflicting style names, though
[12:39:57] <ajpiano> danheberden: but that's not an issue, really
[12:40:02] <ajpiano> because each site has its own child theme
[12:40:44] <ajpiano> so if i make a .foo custom class in qunitjs.com theme, and you make one in learn.jquery.com theme
[12:40:46] <ajpiano> they won't conflict
[12:40:58] <ajpiano> ...at least that's the idea :)

[12:44:41] <danheberden> too bad css doesn't have #id { .class1 {} .class2 {} } syntax
[12:44:56] <danheberden> cuz it's nice to have context when actually writing it
[12:45:01] <ajpiano> when we add css preprocessor
[12:45:08] <ajpiano> i think we can clean up a lot of these things at the same time
[12:45:14] <ajpiano> and then we can do that ^^
[12:45:58] <ajpiano> we should probably file an issue
[12:46:02] <ajpiano> for adding a grunt build process
[12:46:02] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: I'm not against `.foo .bar` as much as `#foo .bar`.
[12:46:05] <ajpiano> to jquery-wp-content
[12:46:21] <scott_gonzalez> But for something like #secondary-banner which is currently an id (but should be a class), it's fine.
[12:46:21] <ajpiano> cause people are gonna wonder why we aren't doing things like min/concat etc
[12:46:30] <danheberden> aye
[12:46:31] <scott_gonzalez> I mean, we're working with what we have at the moment.
[12:46:36] <ajpiano> and at least we can say "we're working on it"

[12:49:15] <jqcommit> 13brand.jquery.org/06master 14871053c 15Richard D. Worth: events and conferences pages: Typo (retrain)
[12:49:25] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: does that mean elements like <div id="banner-secondary"> you want to change to class="banner-secondary" ?
[12:49:37] <danheberden> i'm confused by why id's are bad in that case
[12:49:51] <ajpiano> it's just weird that #banner-secondary is an ID
[12:49:54] <ajpiano> it should be a class
[12:50:12] <danheberden> it's a design element that was designed to never be repeated
[12:50:14] <danheberden> it prevents abuse
[12:50:18] <danheberden> why shouldn't it be an id?
[12:50:24] <ajpiano> it's a silly holdover from 47m convention i think
[12:50:47] <ajpiano> i don't think it's entirely true that you wouldn't want more than one thing that looked like that in a site
[12:50:48] <scott_gonzalez> Because it kills specificity.
[12:51:10] <scott_gonzalez> For example, #content is horrible.
[12:51:20] <ajpiano> right, #content is a compltely different story
[12:51:30] <danheberden> so you want classes to make overriding styles easier
[12:51:35] <scott_gonzalez> You try to write a rule and all of a sudden you *need* to include an id, because something else was scoped under #content.
[12:51:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[12:51:46] <ajpiano> it makes the cascade really hard in some of the places
[12:51:48] <ajpiano> exactly
[12:52:01] <scott_gonzalez> Because .content p and .banner p can fight over where they live in the file
[12:52:03] <danheberden> ok, that i can get behind
[12:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> That was my concern, not that you were trying to scope to the banner.
[12:52:16] <ajpiano> long selector strings with ids somewhere in there, only begets even more long selector strings with ids in there
[12:52:25] <scott_gonzalez> But that you were adding an id to your selector if you didn't need it.
[12:52:59] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: well, it was to write clean css - assuming all elements inside #banner-secondary would start with that id
[12:53:02] <danheberden> as a semantic rule
[12:53:08] <danheberden> thus, not have specificity issues
[12:53:10] <danheberden> but i see your point
[12:53:38] <danheberden> although the extra class will still bump up the specificity weight
[12:53:44] <danheberden> just not as much
[12:53:49] <danheberden> not sure if that actually fixes your problem
[12:53:56] <danheberden> but it at least sounds like a good argument
[12:53:58] <scott_gonzalez> It generally does.
[12:54:33] <scott_gonzalez> Scoping means exceptions, and exceptions are bad for consistency.
[12:54:53] <scott_gonzalez> Classes encourage reuse, which encourages you to design in a way that will allow consistency in other similar parts of the site.
[12:55:11] <scott_gonzalez> As opposed to adding yet another id when you get to a similar part of the site and then having to write a bunch of specific rules again.
[12:55:33] <scott_gonzalez> Here's a good example of something sane:
[12:55:39] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: in a perfect world, yes - i think id's should be used sparingly for large sections that aren't designed to be shared with other areas
[12:55:48] <danheberden> e.g. a main banner area and content area
[12:55:51] <scott_gonzalez> Let's say that on search pages we want to de-emphasize the author of a post.
[12:55:54] <danheberden> like, i'm saying there should be maybe 3 id's
[12:56:10] <scott_gonzalez> danheberden: But those are the most problematic.
[12:56:26] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: i guess my experience in designing and styling websites is different
[12:56:27] <scott_gonzalez> Because then you say, "Oh, let's write a rule for how fonts are rendered *in the content area*"
[12:56:32] <danheberden> i don't know if that makes you necessarily right or wrong
[12:56:32] <scott_gonzalez> And now every exception requires an id.
[12:56:42] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: why shouldn't it?
[12:56:48] <danheberden> why would you write styles that aren't expressive?
[12:57:11] <scott_gonzalez> Because it leads to bloated, hard to maintain, CSS.
[12:57:41] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez: we won't agree on this, which is fine. let me understand what you want though
[12:57:50] <danheberden> do you want just the one class name?
[12:57:57] <danheberden> or would you rather have .banner-secondary .thingy
[12:58:20] <scott_gonzalez> If .thingy is never outside of .banner-secodary, then just the one class name.
[12:58:31] <danheberden> okie dokie
[12:58:40] <scott_gonzalez> If you're writing a rule to make .thingy behave differently inside a banner, then obviously the two class names.
[12:59:01] <danheberden> yeah, no, it's just there - just want to make sure if i'm fixing this
[12:59:07] <danheberden> i'm fixing it the way y'all want
[12:59:15] <danheberden> and that jquery.com is up to speed
[12:59:17] <McPants> Hey guys, would anyone by chance be able to help me out with getting my jQuery plugin onto plugins.jquery.com? Can't seem to figure out where I've messed up
[12:59:29] <gnarf> McPants: what is the repo?
[12:59:30] <scott_gonzalez> McPants: Which repo?
[12:59:43] <McPants> https://github.com/McPants/jquery.shapeshift
[12:59:51] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: i got it, unless you really want it, i figure i'll let you work on it :)
[13:00:17] <scott_gonzalez> It's all yours.
[13:00:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'm triaging issues :-)
[13:00:54] <gnarf> McPants: semver requires 3 version parts - 1.0.0 for instance
[13:01:03] <McPants> Ahhh gotcha, thanks!
[13:01:24] <gnarf> McPants: update the version in the json and and retag as 1.0.0
[13:03:28] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: random thought - IF the github request is a tag push, and we don't find that tag in the repo, retry later?
[13:04:16] <danheberden> ok shoot
[13:04:19] <scott_gonzalez> gnarf: We don't inspect that data.
[13:04:22] <danheberden> i can't not use #banner-secondary
[13:04:24] <gnarf> McPants: so, things look okay, but the timing on your github is a little wacky
[13:04:31] <danheberden> for things like h3
[13:04:35] <danheberden> oh well
[13:04:35] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather just get this working consistently.
[13:04:38] <gnarf> McPants: er remove "your" from that statement
[13:04:42] <gnarf> timing on github is funkuy
[13:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> I think we just need to queue, instead of drop, parallel requests.
[13:04:58] <gnarf> can you goto /admin/hooks and hit "test hook" once?
[13:05:10] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: well if there is already one in the queue
[13:05:11] <McPants> Okies, I'm patient :)
[13:07:15] <gnarf> maybe it should delay the one already in the queue
[13:07:21] <ajpiano> danheberden: i think the point of that last conversation si that  for right now, #banner-secondary is fine
[13:07:33] <ajpiano> there's just a lot of id-related cruft and stuff that we want to clean up
[13:07:52] <ajpiano> but not right this second ... right this second, we can work with what we've got
[13:07:57] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: and maybe we should e-mail github support about it? see if they have any idea what might be happening?
[13:08:20] <gnarf> McPants: done! :)

[13:32:09] <danheberden> weird, 4 columns + 8 columns doesn't fill the whole hting
[13:32:10] <danheberden> *thing
[13:32:17] <danheberden> it's not enough width
[13:33:17] <ajpiano> ah danheberden i think it's something to do with the fact that .features-box is also a .row
[13:33:44] <ajpiano> danheberden: if you wanted, you could take out the .features-box container and have all 4 things be part of a single top row grid
[13:33:45] <danheberden> i might just fix it in the style.css for jquery.com instead of possibly borking other sites
[13:33:48] <ajpiano> instead of 8/4 with nested
[13:34:07] <danheberden> the only problem is they would be infront of the download box then
[13:34:11] <ajpiano> nah
[13:34:16] <ajpiano> check out the push-pull styles
[13:34:25] <ajpiano> the download box is actually before them in the source
[13:34:26] <danheberden> ok, i'll look
[13:34:39] <ajpiano> the existing way is an example, i think taking out the nesting would fix it
[13:43:01] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Still planning on launching the sites today?
[13:43:06] <scott_gonzalez> Or gonna wait till Monday?
[13:43:18] <ajpiano> still planning on it
[13:43:33] <ajpiano> nearly done w/ this
[13:43:38] <ajpiano> should be done by 5:15ish
[13:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, well I'm stepping away from the computer.
[13:43:50] <ajpiano> then i want to put out any burning fires
[13:43:59] <ajpiano> and then push it all out around 6?
[13:44:06] <scott_gonzalez> Call/text when you need me for the blog.
[13:44:08] <ajpiano> how's that sound to you?
[13:44:24] <ajpiano> unless you want to add the blog theme to prod now
[13:44:33] <scott_gonzalez> I can do that too if you want.
[13:44:44] <ajpiano> i will prob want to do the release w/ you around, got a lot to tag
[13:44:48] <ajpiano> but i suspect you'll be back by then anyway
[13:44:59] <scott_gonzalez> We've got people coming over tonight.
[13:45:00] <ajpiano> yea, add but don't activate
[13:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> But I'll be home.
[13:45:14] <ajpiano> ah ok
[13:45:20] <ajpiano> yeah i don't want to be on the comp much either
[13:45:24] <scott_gonzalez> It replaces the whole themes directory, so it's gonna blow up the current theme.
[13:45:36] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: ohhh...
[13:45:40] <scott_gonzalez> So just call/text when you're ready to deploy and I'll come back.
[13:45:42] <ajpiano> let's hold off a little bit then, i'll text you in a bit
[13:45:44] <ajpiano> sounds good
[13:46:09] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i don't have you in my phone somehow, can you just shoot me a text
[13:48:12] <scott_gonzalez> nice response ;-)
[13:48:48] <ajpiano> ;)
[13:50:39] <gnarf> ajpiano: you got me ya?
[13:51:01] <ajpiano> yep

[13:58:29] <jonthornton> @ajpiano: sorry to bug you again
[13:58:50] <jonthornton> i fixed the syntax error, made a new tag and pushed, and still no plugin registry love
[13:59:01] <gnarf> jonthornton: which repo?
[13:59:14] <jonthornton> https://github.com/jonthornton/jquery-timepicker/
[14:00:44] <gnarf> jonthornton: can you hit the "test hook" in the /admin/hooks page ?
[14:02:16] <gnarf> jonthornton: there is an awkward bug we are experiencing right now where after we get the github hook, we do a fetch of your repo, but your tag isn't there yet
[14:02:39] <gnarf> jonthornton: try "poking" the bear :)
[14:02:51] <jonthornton> haha. Just hit the test hook button
[14:03:18] <gnarf> incoming.....
[14:03:33] <gnarf> Jan 18 14:03:18 nc02 plugins.jquery.com[9714]: github/jonthornton attempted to add timepicker which is owned by github/deanc
[14:04:20] <gnarf> someone beat you to the name, you'll have to put a prefix on it
[14:04:26] <gnarf> or change it
[14:04:37] <gnarf> change the manifest filename, and the "name": inside it
[14:04:43] <jonthornton> gah
[14:04:51] <jonthornton> ok
[14:06:58] <jonthornton> Can anything be done about the name? My project is fairly well established and the project that grabbed that name is 4 days old
[14:07:18] <jonthornton> https://github.com/deanc/jquery-timepicker vs https://github.com/jonthornton/jquery-timepicker
[14:11:03] <ajpiano> hmm
[14:11:08] <ajpiano> jonthornton: sorry about that
[14:11:29] <ajpiano> so, we have a first come, first serve policy on names
[14:11:40] <ajpiano> the thing about "Timepicker" is that it's a relatively common name
[14:12:23] <jonthornton> yup, understood
[14:12:37] <jonthornton> so my only option is to change the name of my project?
[14:12:38] <ajpiano> however... his project does not have any documentation
[14:13:05] <ajpiano> at the moment, yes
[14:13:25] <jonthornton> ok
[14:13:25] <ajpiano> if you want to get it on the site like, in the short term
[14:14:14] <jonthornton> i do :). would "jquery-timepicker" be an acceptable name?
[14:14:15] <ajpiano> sorry that this happened
[14:14:23] <ajpiano> if it makes you feel any better, this is the first one
[14:14:26] <jonthornton> instead of simply "timepicker"
[14:14:26] <ajpiano> but probably not the last
[14:14:31] <gnarf> jonthornton: or even do like a jt.timepicker
[14:14:37] <gnarf> jTimepicker
[14:14:40] <ajpiano> jonthornton: i'd recommend something like gnarf says
[14:14:49] <jonthornton> ok
[14:14:57] <gnarf> jonthornton: having jquery in the name is kinda redundant/silly on a jquery plugins repo, yea?
[14:15:16] <ajpiano> you don't have to "play up" the package name that much, if you don't want
[14:15:26] <jonthornton> it is, but i'm trying to have a non-prefix prefix :)
[14:15:32] <ajpiano> the title field is what displays on the site
[14:15:42] <gnarf> jonthornton: how about "jottime"
[14:15:50] * gnarf shrugs
[14:15:50] <b-ot> ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
[14:15:55] <jonthornton> haha
[14:15:56] <gnarf> trying to be clever now
[14:16:06] <gnarf> you got a chance to break the mold of timepicker plugins called "timepicker"
[14:16:07] <gnarf> :)
[14:16:10] <jonthornton> i'll give jt.timepicker a shot
[14:17:54] <ajpiano> so jonthornton, i feel your pain :) but i bet that there is yet another jquery timepicker out there that calls itself "timepicker" that's even older than yours :)
[14:18:16] <ajpiano> so you can see the conundrum we're in here
[14:19:16] <jonthornton> i head you. and there is an older one :) https://github.com/perifer/timePicker
[14:19:24] <jonthornton> i hear* you
[14:19:58] <ajpiano> jonthornton: on the other hand, if someone went and did the same with like http://christophercliff.com/sausage/
[14:20:10] <ajpiano> we're more likely to be sympathetic in those cases
[14:20:53] <jonthornton> success! http://plugins.jquery.com/jt.timepicker/
[14:21:23] <gnarf> `hi5 @jonthornton
[14:21:23] <b-ot> jonthornton, ‚ã∞‚Åµ‚ã±
[14:22:04] <jonthornton> thanks again for your help! off to resolve some pull requests...
[14:22:08] <gnarf> jonthornton: can you do me one favor
[14:22:12] <gnarf> jonthornton: hit test hook one more time?
[14:22:17] <gnarf> jonthornton: i think you exposed a minor bug
[14:22:18] <jonthornton> sure
[14:22:29] <gnarf> it seems to be re-parsing your 1.0.5 manifest every push
[14:22:29] <gnarf> :)
[14:22:53] <jonthornton> weird. just send test hook
[14:26:57] <gnarf> jonthornton: thanks

[18:36:04] <joewalnes> Hello. I'm trying to determine why my plugin isn't appearing on the new plugins site. I've setup a git webhook, added a manifest, tagged and pushed, but I see nothing.
[18:36:27] <joewalnes> Is there any way I can get some debugging, to see why it's not appearing?
[18:36:38] <joewalnes> https://github.com/joewalnes/jquery-simple-context-menu/
[18:50:08] <ajpiano> hi joewalnes
[18:50:19] <ajpiano> just saw your e-mail too... just walked in from din
[18:50:21] <ajpiano> ner
[18:50:22] <ajpiano> :)
[18:50:38] <ajpiano> just tailed the logs
[18:50:39] <ajpiano> Manifest errors: github/joewalnes/jquery-simple-context-menu 1.3.0 simplecontextmenu.jquery.json [ 'Invalid version range for dependency: jquery.' ]
[18:51:18] <ajpiano> joewalnes: appears you're running into https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/78
[18:51:18] <b-ot> ajpiano, issue #78 by scottgonzalez (1d 20h ago): "*" dependency range doesn't work
[18:51:27] <ajpiano> can you update the dependency range
[18:51:36] <ajpiano> and then bump your version, tag and try pushing again?
[18:51:55] <ajpiano> i'll be on and offf but give that a shot and hopefully it will work!
[18:51:59] <ajpiano> otherwise, ping me
[18:52:50] <joewalnes> ok, trying that now...
[18:55:03] <joewalnes> pushing now
[18:55:50] <joewalnes> how long does it usually take to appear on the site?
[18:56:04] <ajpiano> it should be a minute or two or something has not worked :)
[18:56:09] <ajpiano> i don't see a new commit, joewalnes
[18:56:20] <ajpiano> oh ther eit is
[18:56:44] <ajpiano> joewalnes: if you pushed 1.3.1, you also have to update your manifest file to have 1.3.1 :/
[18:57:36] <ajpiano> can you try the whole thing... manifest and semver again, with 1.3.2 ?
[18:57:53] <ajpiano> oh wait
[18:57:58] <ajpiano> i seeeeeeeeee something happening
[18:58:13] <joewalnes> trying again

[19:00:30] <joewalnes> thanks, bye.
[21:11:08] <dantuck> Hello everyone. I have been trying to get my plugin added to the registry but it still has not shown up. Is there a delay?
