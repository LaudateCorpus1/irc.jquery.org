[07:44:41] <dinbror> Hello. Im trying to commit a new tag for my plugin, but it keeps saying the "Manifest version (0.9.1) does not match tag!" The manifest tag is the old one. I deleted my repo some weeks ago but created a new one with the same name so I think it somehow is pulling the data from the deleted one?? What to do
