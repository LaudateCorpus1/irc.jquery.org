[12:00:00] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom arthurvr I saw a mention in #jquery-meeting, what's up?
[12:00:33] <arthurvr> We were discussing porting code examples on the site over to the recent code style changes. 
[12:00:44] <arthurvr> And wondering if we could automate things.
[12:01:10] <arthurvr> For markdown thatâ€™s pretty easy but I wonder if we could find a good solution with the XML API sites setup.
[12:01:28] <arthurvr> Using JSCS/esformatter I mean.
[12:11:12] <arthurvr> scott_gonzalez: ^
[12:12:18] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz was working on a tool to pull scripts out of HTML files and do checks on them.
[12:12:35] <scott_gonzalez> So he might be able to put something together for that.
[12:12:53] <arschmitz> Yeah
[12:13:27] <arthurvr> I already said I was going to work on a solution for markdown (it should be as easy as a regex for code blocks and jscs). Though the xml thing isnâ€™t something Iâ€™ll be able to handle.
[12:13:27] <arschmitz> i could do that
[12:13:34] <arthurvr> awesome arschmitz 
[12:14:14] <arschmitz> arthurvr: id have to try to be sure but pretty sure what i have would work on markdown just fine
[12:14:22] <arschmitz> if i add an option to fix
[12:14:27] <arschmitz> right now it just validates
[12:14:47] <arthurvr> yeah thatâ€™s what I had in mind. Awesomesauce
[12:15:34] <arschmitz> arthurvr: it does css too
[12:20:05] <arthurvr> arschmitz: keep me updated :)
[12:20:24] <arschmitz> arthurvr: will do
[12:21:28] <arthurvr> scott_gonzalez: now that youâ€™re here, reminds me to ask, is there any chance we would be able to run xmllint in some kind of CI on PRs? Itâ€™s really easy to break things in XML and some team members even donâ€™t have a working local setup. cc kswedberg agcolom  
[12:23:20] <arschmitz> arthurvr: https://github.com/alappe/grunt-xmllint
[12:23:51] <arthurvr> arschmitz: we have  that task, it just doesnâ€™t run in CI
[12:23:55] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[12:24:03] <arthurvr> it sounds like useful no?
[12:24:48] <arthurvr> scott_gonzalez: gonna bring it up at next content meeting but Iâ€™d love to have that.
[12:25:07] <scott_gonzalez> Can you file an issue for it so it lands in my inbox?
[12:25:10] <scott_gonzalez> That's my main todo list.
[12:25:23] <arthurvr> in what repo?
[12:26:05] <scott_gonzalez> Feel free to do it in any of them. I'll just apply it everywhere after confirming that it works.
