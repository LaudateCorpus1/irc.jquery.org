[08:21:56] <gnarf> I'm trying to convince lady3bean to make a commit today on something -- you got any open issues she could try to tackle? :)
[08:38:39] <lady3bean> hey yâ€™all! Iâ€™m fairly new to web development and Iâ€™d like to contribute to jQuery as I continue to expand my knowledge of it. Iâ€™m a good writer if I do say so myself, and perhaps my perspective could catch places where needed context and information is left assumed or unexplained. I am happy to work on documentation as well as adding to the coding examples to make them clear and relevant. Advice on where to focus would be great!
[08:42:42] <agcolom> gnarf lady3bean: Hi! great to hear from you :-) I think a good start would be to check out https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues and https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues 
[08:44:52] <agcolom> Also, you could check whether you believe that some new articles should be created and added to http://learn.jquery.com/ that'd be something
