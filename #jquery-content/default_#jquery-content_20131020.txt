[12:47:57] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: kswedberg: Sorry for messing up the docs on eq(). I don't even remember making that change (1 to a 2) so must have been a typo! Sorry :-(
[12:48:51] <agcolom> I thought I was only changing the formatting.... 
[14:59:13] <kswedberg> agcolom: no problem at all. With all the massive cleanup work, an error here or there was bound to creep in.
