[06:05:25] <scott_gonzalez> isaacdurazo: Do you have a few minutes to look at a change for our site footers? Pretty much any time will work for me.
[06:27:58] <jquicommit> [13api.jqueryui.com] 15scottgonzalez closed issue #193: jQuery.widget: _on() doesn't always use this.element for omitted element parameter 02http://git.io/Ovic9A
[06:32:31] <isaacdurazo> sure thing scott_gonzalez, what is it?
[06:33:19] <scott_gonzalez> We're removing the CDN quick access section.
[06:34:20] <scott_gonzalez> But it ends up looking a bit odd because there's no balance in the footer.
[06:34:26] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/1k0t0j2E3I1G
[06:34:54] <scott_gonzalez> http://cl.ly/image/3x40190U362J
[06:35:45] <scott_gonzalez> The three remaining links in the quick access section don't really seem necessary either.
[06:35:58] <scott_gonzalez> Direct access to GitHub from every single page doesn't seem necessary.
[06:36:06] <scott_gonzalez> The forum link is duplicated right below on the right.
[06:36:14] <scott_gonzalez> And the bugs link is just confusing since it's not for reporting web site bugs.
[06:36:15] <isaacdurazo> So are we getting rid of the books sections as well?
[06:36:30] <scott_gonzalez> Books are staying. The second screenshot is from jquerymobile.com which doesn't currently have any books.
[06:36:39] <isaacdurazo> gotcha
[06:36:46] <scott_gonzalez> The first is from jquery.com
[06:37:15] <scott_gonzalez> As far as I'm concerned, there are no design elements that need to stay. The entire footer can be redesigned if that helps.
[06:38:00] <scott_gonzalez> We also end up with footers that just seem out of place, like jquery.org has links for jQuery core stuff.
[06:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think anyone on jquery.org is looking for the jQuery core bug tracker or forum.
[06:38:40] <scott_gonzalez> Same for brand.jquery.org
[06:40:44] <isaacdurazo> Yeah, there's some inconsistency. I feel like we would need a little more than just get rid of stuff
[06:41:01] <isaacdurazo> I can help with a redesign
[06:42:13] <isaacdurazo> what if we have a "books" link in the footer that takes you to a "books" sections?
[06:42:44] <isaacdurazo> that could save us some space in the footer and solve the balance issue
[06:43:55] <isaacdurazo> or we could move them somewhere in http://learn.jquery.com/
[06:44:12] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: ^
[06:46:39] <kborchers> i would like the books on every page ... we should rename and possibly expand that to include more than 3 items as i would like to also place other affiliates there
[06:46:47] <kborchers> i want them on every page because they bring in money
[06:47:47] <isaacdurazo> one thing we could do if we want to keep them on every page, is center them
[06:48:01] <kborchers> isaacdurazo: would it be possible for you to just play around with a couple of options and let us see what you come up with and go from there?
[06:48:04] <isaacdurazo> like we center the content here: http://qunitjs.com/
[06:48:32] <isaacdurazo> sure kborchers
[06:48:35] <kborchers> yeah the centering on the qunit site looks pretty good
[06:48:56] <kborchers> keep in mind, as i'm sure you're aware, they layout changes on mobile
[06:49:26] <isaacdurazo> yes
[06:49:31] <kborchers> isaacdurazo: thanks
[06:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> isaacdurazo: Feel free to ping me if you have any questions about the content in the footer.
[06:50:16] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: do you have a particular timeframe for this? i know asap but is there a deadline you want to meet?
[06:50:18] <isaacdurazo> scott_gonzalez are we getting rid of the quick access on all the sites?
[06:50:39] <scott_gonzalez> I personally would like to.
[06:50:45] <scott_gonzalez> We have agreement to remove CDN links.
[06:50:53] <kborchers> i think it makes sense to get rid of them everywhere
[06:50:55] <scott_gonzalez> But as I said, I don't think the other parts of quick access provide much value.
[06:51:12] <isaacdurazo> yeah, agree on that
[06:51:15] <scott_gonzalez> kborchers: No specific deadline, other than before we get ANOTHER PR to update the CDN links.
[06:51:22] <kborchers> :)
[06:51:23] <kborchers> ok
[06:51:37] <scott_gonzalez> I did say something like "next week" last week in one of the PRs :-P
[06:51:37] <isaacdurazo> ok, I have a busy day today but can work on it tonight
[06:51:43] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks isaacdurazo

[07:27:09] <scott_gonzalez> I just realized that not a single one of our project sites have licensing terms.
[07:31:04] <ajpiano> the repos that power those sites have licensing terms
[07:32:37] <scott_gonzalez> I meant that jquery.com never mentions the license for jQuery.
[07:32:52] <scott_gonzalez> Same for jqueryui.com and jQuery UI, jquerymobile.com and jQuery Mobile.
[07:33:43] <scott_gonzalez> isaacdurazo: We should probably link to https://jquery.org/license/ from our footers.
[07:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> At least for the code projects.
[07:40:42] <isaacdurazo> cool scott_gonzalez, I'll keep that in mind then
