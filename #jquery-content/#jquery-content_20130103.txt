[02:38:00] <agcolom> ajpiano: scott_gonzalez kswedberg Just to let you know that I will be traveling back to Paris this evening and will be on the train at the time of the meeting today...
[04:57:55] <kswedberg> agcolom: have a safe trip! ajpiano, scott_gonzalez: I have a meeting for my day job at the same time today, so the jquery-meeting channel will only have a sliver of my attention, unfortunately. 
[04:58:15] <kswedberg> but feel free to ping me if you want my input on something.
[07:18:45] <scott_gonzalez> rworth ajpiano: Can we close the comment issue with a decision of Disqus?
[07:19:03] <rworth> worksforme
[07:19:23] <ajpiano> +1
[07:19:50] <scott_gonzalez> CLOSED!
[07:36:51] <scott_gonzalez> What do we need to do for this? https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/132
[07:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Do you have a doc saying which fonts to use where?
[07:43:54] <ajpiano> i have a document, but i don't have the fonts
[07:44:06] <ajpiano> i thought klavika was a typekit font
[07:44:20] <ajpiano> but i got the typekit login during vacation from rworth and lo and behold, it isn't
[07:44:39] <ajpiano> so i have to figure out what to do about that now
[07:45:24] <ajpiano> though according to http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/klavika/complete-specs-webfonts it is on typekit
[07:45:44] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:46:23] <ajpiano> oh i see
[07:46:42] <rworth> http://processtypefoundry.com/help/#UsingTypekit1
[07:46:46] <ajpiano> yup
[07:46:48] <ajpiano> just found that
[07:46:49] <rworth> :)
[07:47:01] <ajpiano> now to find the link
[07:48:26] <ajpiano> hrm
[07:48:53] <ajpiano> rworth: did we purchase the webfont license or just the font
[07:49:03] <ajpiano> cause there's no file with a link to send fonts to typekit
[07:49:05] <rworth> let me see
[07:49:16] <scott_gonzalez> The webfonts license isn't that expensive.
[07:49:22] <rworth> we probably just got the font, for use on the logos
[07:49:34] <scott_gonzalez> So we have a desktop license?
[07:50:14] <ajpiano> http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/klavika/purchase-options-webfonts
[07:50:16] <scott_gonzalez> The webfonts license is only $134 per primary domain + 5 subdomains.
[07:50:32] <scott_gonzalez> We do have a fair amount of primary domains though.
[07:50:44] <ajpiano> "contact us directly for pricing."
[07:50:59] <scott_gonzalez> http://processtypefoundry.com/fonts/klavika/purchase-options-webfonts
[07:51:29] <ajpiano> ah it's 5 subdomains per
[07:51:31] <rworth> yeah, we have a desktop license
[07:51:40] <ajpiano> dang
[07:51:47] <scott_gonzalez> The pricing also depends on how many weights we want.
[07:51:56] <ajpiano> that's exactly what made me say dang
[07:52:13] <scott_gonzalez> Like, if we're only using one weight because we're only using it for headers, it's super cheap.
[07:52:27] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PHHCDchZdS5Jn2eepLb3fkh3kRZSDphU7X4Im-CxHwc/edit
[07:52:36] <ajpiano> all we need is bold
[07:52:50] <scott_gonzalez> nice
[07:53:02] <scott_gonzalez> $29 per primary domain.
[07:53:05] <ajpiano> and technically bold italic but i don't know if we actually need it
[07:53:06] <scott_gonzalez> We can afford that :-)
[07:53:40] <ajpiano> i think we have 6 primary domains
[07:53:53] <ajpiano> jquery.com, jquery.org, jqueryui.com, jquerymobile.com, sizzlejs.com, qunitjs.com
[07:54:05] <scott_gonzalez> That's the list I came up with too.
[07:54:19] <scott_gonzalez> I wonder if we have more than 5 subdomains for jquery.com
[07:54:48] <scott_gonzalez> blog, plugins, learn, contribute, api = 5
[07:54:53] <ajpiano> yeah
[07:54:55] <ajpiano> and then there's... books
[07:55:05] <scott_gonzalez> books, bugs?
[07:55:09] <ajpiano> yeah
[07:55:20] <kswedberg> code.
[07:55:22] <ajpiano> but right now we only have 5 that are close-to-live and on web-base-template
[07:55:26] <rworth> we should contact them and see if they want to donate it
[07:55:39] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good
[07:55:43] <rworth> we could credit them as a sponsor and link to their site
[07:55:49] <scott_gonzalez> We're stopping for food (driving to NY right now).
[07:55:55] <ajpiano> rworth: can you get on that?
[07:56:00] <rworth> ajpiano sure
[07:56:06] <ajpiano> thanks
[07:56:12] <ajpiano> and either way, check on the subdomains
[07:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> For <$200?
[07:56:28] <ajpiano> i do sort of agree with scott_gonzalez though
[07:56:49] <rworth> oh, I missed how cheap you guys got it down to
[07:56:57] <ajpiano> but if we have to contact them to find out about the subdomains anyway, might be worth an ask
[07:57:00] <rworth> (was afk for a bit)
[07:57:02] <scott_gonzalez> If we're only getting one weight, it's $29 per domain.
[07:57:14] <ajpiano> if we only get bold and bold italic, each is $174 each
[07:57:16] <ajpiano> for 6 domains
[07:57:33] <rworth> I'll see what they say. If they give us the whole package for unlimited domains and subdomains, I'd say it's a good deal :)
[07:57:40] <ajpiano> right ;)
[08:12:02] * rworth initiated contact via web form
[08:37:05] <ajpiano> thrilling :p

[09:23:07] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano rworth: We don't have a comp for this, do we? https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/issues/49
[09:23:15] <scott_gonzalez> If we do, I can get that done now.
[09:23:15] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: for my new syntax highlighting stuff  in grunt-jquery-content, should i just push it to a branch?
[09:23:23] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:24:00] <rworth> scott_gonzalez I've only seen what's on the learn site
[09:24:05] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: the way it is in the learn site is how it's comped http://stage.learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/
[09:24:41] <scott_gonzalez> But as jzaefferer has mentioned, that will look bad on almost every site.
[09:24:58] <scott_gonzalez> Most sites don't have anything at the bottom of the page.
[09:25:32] <ajpiano> we could do a corner ribbon?
[09:25:47] <ajpiano> cause it's basically the fork on github thing
[09:25:50] <ajpiano> only not
[09:26:39] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[09:26:58] <scott_gonzalez> Are you thinking a ribbon on the top or bottom?
[09:27:05] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't want a ribbon on the top.
[09:27:08] <ajpiano> top right corner
[09:27:18] <ajpiano> ah
[09:27:19] <ajpiano> well hm
[09:27:27] <ajpiano> if it's at the bottom it's not as discoverable
[09:27:37] <ajpiano> and if there's no room for a button on the bottom, how is there room for a ribbon
[09:27:42] <ajpiano> isn't there no bottom at the bottom
[09:29:06] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what "no bottom at the bottom" means.
[09:29:16] <ajpiano> [12:24 ] <scott_gonzalez> Most sites don't have anything at the bottom of the page.
[09:29:31] <ajpiano> i'd think a button would be easier to put at the bottom than a ribbon
[09:29:35] <ajpiano> cause a ribbon has to overlay... something
[09:29:54] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, yeah, I mean that most sites don't have a footer in the content area.
[09:30:40] <ajpiano> well it seems they will have to get one :p

[11:14:34] <ajpiano> argh
[11:15:41] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[11:16:02] <ajpiano> the fact that the code blocks inside xml entries are indented
[11:16:04] <ajpiano> is causing me trouble
[11:16:31] <scott_gonzalez> :-/
[11:16:58] <ajpiano> like, the fact that every block is uniformly intended all the way, so that every block starts 7 tabs in
[11:17:02] <ajpiano> or whatever
[11:17:30] <ajpiano> i'll show you what i mean
[11:17:33] <scott_gonzalez> Which file are you looking at?
[11:17:53] <ajpiano> https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/blob/master/entries/jQuery.widget.xml#L28-L30
[11:18:25] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, those, we can change those.
[11:18:54] <ajpiano> that's a lot of manual out-denting
[11:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> I guess it depends on whether core does this.
[11:19:18] <scott_gonzalez> UI's docs are pretty small.
[11:19:27] <ajpiano> http://cl.ly/image/113G3n0K0K3D
[11:19:36] <scott_gonzalez> And the use of <pre> in descriptions isn't very common in UI.
[11:20:04] <ajpiano> i can replace tabs with whatever i want, and probably will replace down to two spaces, but it's still super far out
[11:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> We could write some code to handle this.
[11:20:11] <ajpiano> yeah
[11:20:13] <ajpiano> that's what i'm thinking
[11:20:20] <ajpiano> it's just what i'm wrestling with right now
[11:20:24] <ajpiano> cause i have it all working fine on contribute.com
[11:20:30] <scott_gonzalez> Find the common number of leading tabs and remove them.
[11:20:30] <ajpiano> and on normal code blocks in api docs
[11:20:34] <ajpiano> yeah, exactly
[11:20:41] <scott_gonzalez> And trim trailing and leading blank lines.
[11:20:41] <ajpiano> that's exactly what i was thinking :)
[11:20:54] <ajpiano> cool
[11:21:27] <scott_gonzalez> I remember the first time I used codedumper.com and saw that it did that, I was amazed.
[11:22:27] <ajpiano> dang, i've never even seen that
[11:22:48] <ajpiano> seems like just another pastebin

[21:48:11] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: if you're still about, i just pushed my progress with highlight.js etc
[21:48:37] <ajpiano> the indenting/outdenting is still not working quite right, it's working OK, but not quite right
[21:50:27] <ajpiano> i.e., the automatic outdenting when necessary.
[21:51:02] <ajpiano> in general though it's definitely most of the way there: http://cl.ly/image/3K0W3x1s270y
[21:52:25] <ajpiano> we should connect tomorrow and have you get it running and i can explain where the inadequacies, etc. are
[21:52:54] <ajpiano> and figure out how to deal with the highlight.js build, etc
[21:53:15] <ajpiano> i think we may be able to get away with not having to build if we just don't autodetect language at all, which we may be able to get away with
[21:53:47] <ajpiano> indeed, it may even be necessary to not do it, as even with a minimal set of languages, it's still misidentifying really short jquery snippets as CSS, for instance
[21:55:26] <ajpiano> just wanted to at least get this out in the open, been sitting on it long enough
[21:57:24] <ajpiano> should also discuss whether to compress tabs to 2 spaces, e.g., http://cl.ly/image/3t0M3i1v2y3P
[21:57:28] <ajpiano> anyway, i'm thinking out loud :)
