[13:39:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: ^^^^ can you take a look at that?
[13:41:38] <gnarf> cc arthurvr: would allow us to add redirects.json files to the content repos and move our redirects there
[13:41:54] <gnarf> requires explicit listing tho, no wildcard support (intentionally)
[13:42:48] <arthurvr> Thanks gnarf! Neat. Iâ€™m going to take a look this evening =)
[13:43:07] <gnarf> arthurvr: i thought we had opened an issue for this task
[13:43:13] <gnarf> do you remember it?
[13:43:19] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/issues/61
[13:53:55] <gnarf> arthurvr: cool - well - it's kind of hard to test the grunt-jquery-content locally
[13:53:57] <gnarf> for it
[13:54:10] <gnarf> but hopefully scott_gonzalez can take a look and +1 these two prs
[13:54:39] <arthurvr> yup - Hard to write units for these tasks too :(
[13:56:58] <gnarf> arthurvr: if we land these two PR's and version bump grunt-jquery-content we should be able to start converting some of the redirects defined in nginx to redirects.json
[13:57:55] <arthurvr> gnarf: Cool. I donâ€™t think there are so much redirects to port over anyways, are there?
[13:58:08] <gnarf> not that many
[13:59:49] <arthurvr> Should we document this on http://contribute.jquery.org/web-sites/?
[13:59:50] <arthurvr>  Even if it's just for our future selves
