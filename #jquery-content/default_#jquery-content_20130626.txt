[06:51:01] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: awesome :-)
[06:51:02] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: i'm on vacay in the italian countryside, the only thing i'm working on is getting the austin event site this week otherwise i am out of commission
[06:51:03] <ajpiano> :)
[06:51:31] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: ok, definitely don't work on docs while you're in Italy :-)
[06:51:35] <rworth> ajpiano I'm working on eventbrite now. Dan got the site in pretty good shape over the weekend. Have you seen his branch?
[06:51:53] <ajpiano> rworth: yea, i merged it into the austin site and have been making edits while omw from rome to florence
[06:52:23] <ajpiano> i'll have a PR for jquery-wp-content with the new ad soon as well as web-events
[06:52:26] <ajpiano> in a bit

[13:02:55] <ajpiano> rworth: danheberden i have merged the austin-dan branch into austin branch and pushed a bunch of copy and styling edits
[13:03:15] <rworth> ajpiano thanks
[13:03:33] <ajpiano> rworth: scott_gonzalez i also pushed a branch to jquery-wp-content that adds the ad for austin and event into the top nav menu
[13:03:55] <ajpiano> i'm gonna go relax for a bit, will be back on later
[13:04:02] <ajpiano> i think we probably should put the hotel info etc
[13:04:13] <rworth> ok
[13:04:17] <ajpiano> rworth: can you handle that with the eventbrite such
[13:04:21] <rworth> yeah
[13:07:13] <ajpiano> i added the CFP in an iframe, you can decide whether or not to keep it, i think it's helpful
[10:22:15] <danheberden> ajpiano: awes
[10:52:00] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: agcolom and I have a question about grammar :-)
[10:52:10] <scott_gonzalez> "Any styles that cannot be animated will be changed at the end of the animation."
[10:52:19] <scott_gonzalez> Is "any styles" correct or should it be "any style" ?
[10:52:34] <scott_gonzalez> I think both forms are correct, but we wanted someone to verify.
[13:20:34] <scott_gonzalez> Is everyone ok if I make some changes and potentionally break some sites?
[13:20:47] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, hearing no objections, I'll just go ahead and change stuff :-)
[13:42:00] <kborchers> scott_gonzalez: as long as you only break release notes and upgrade guides then no one will notice :P
[13:42:10] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[13:42:19] <scott_gonzalez> I was thinking more along the lines of breaking icons all over the place
[13:42:24] <scott_gonzalez> Or all form labels.
[13:42:28] <scott_gonzalez> Things like that.
[13:42:35] <kborchers> sounds fun :)

[23:56:21] <agcolom> just for the record, irccloud has been unable to connect to freenode for the last 10h... so I'm switching to limechat... however, I have no history, so not sure what happened in the last 10h or so... 
[23:57:32] <agcolom> plus I guess this will disconnect when I close my laptop? (irccloud was giving me full history....)...
[23:58:22] <agcolom> actually it's not 10h but 11h...
