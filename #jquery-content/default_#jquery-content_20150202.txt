[12:08:29] <arthurvr> We really have to make our docs setup work on windows guys
[12:08:55] <arthurvr> seems like nobody is able to setup the jquery-wp-content stuff
[12:09:30] <arthurvr> DaveMethvin is running into it too
[12:09:46] <arthurvr> recently somebody started complaining about it in PM.
[12:10:01] <arthurvr> We‚Äôre losing many awesome contributions this way.
[12:10:24] <arthurvr> for sure in the API docs, xml is hard without being able to test it.
[12:21:53] <Gryffin> Hi Guys.. I am trying to get a jQuery plugin published, I followed all the instructions in http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/ Now how do I know if it works or not?
[12:22:29] <Gryffin> The error log seems to lead nowhere, http://plugins.jquery.com/error.log
[12:22:54] <Gryffin> This is repo of my plugin.. https://github.com/anoopelias/mouseheld
[12:23:23] <Gryffin> Of course, http://plugins.jquery.com/mouseheld is leading me to 404
[12:23:29] <arthurvr> Gryffin: see https://plugins.jquery.com/
[12:23:40] <arthurvr> Gryffin: the plugins registry is currently in read-only mode
[12:23:47] <arthurvr> Gryffin: ‚ÄùNew plugin releases will not be processed.‚Äù
[12:25:49] <Gryffin> arthurvr : Thanks. However, I couldn't find this info anywhere else. It will be nice if this link can clearly say that.. http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/ This is the top one on google search results
[12:26:27] <arthurvr> Gryffin: totally agred, and hey, we‚Äôre working on it: https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/161
[12:27:23] <arthurvr> Gryffin: we first want to decide everything and of course then docs will get updated.
[12:28:16] <Gryffin> arthurvr : Alright, no worries. :) I will keep a tab on that issue.
