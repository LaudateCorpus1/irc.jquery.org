[08:24:06] <Mottie> Good morning!... I just have a quick observation. On the jQuery page, the CDN at the bottom is pointing to Google's CDN & not showing 1.9.1, and the jQuery UI page CDN is pointing to the code.jquery.com files, and also not pointing at version 1.9.1.
[08:24:50] <ajpiano> right on Mottie
[08:24:58] <ajpiano> just saw a tweet mentioning same
[08:25:02] <ajpiano> i'll get 'em up dated
[08:25:15] <ajpiano> Mottie: one of these days we're gonna have to get you making some PRs on all this :)
[08:25:18] <Mottie> Ok!
[08:25:25] <Mottie> LOL
[08:25:44] <ajpiano> i am more than happy to help you get set up
[08:26:36] <Mottie> In all honesty, I have no idea what a PR is LOL
[08:26:42] <ajpiano> pull request
[08:26:47] <Mottie> ahhh
[08:26:51] <Mottie> that PR
[08:35:05] <ajpiano> haha
[08:35:11] <ajpiano> not public relations
[08:35:15] <Mottie> whew
[08:35:42] <Mottie> I was thinking you mean procedural review o.O
[08:35:50] <Mottie> *meant
[08:36:29] <Mottie> ok one more quicky... I was using the spinner, and when I focus the input, Chrome for Windows shows this highlight http://i50.tinypic.com/2zhgztc.jpg
[08:37:05] <Mottie> Not sure if it looks better on a Mac, but that doesn't look good to me
[08:37:18] <scott_gonzalez> jqueryui.com should be updated as jQuery UI is updated.
[08:37:28] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure that we should be updating jqueryui.com's footer on core releases.
[08:37:32] <scott_gonzalez> We've never done that in the past.
[08:37:49] <scott_gonzalez> Download builder will continue to server jQuery 1.9.0 for jQuery UI 1.10.0.
[08:37:50] <Mottie> I just meant the CDN pointing to jQuery, not jQuery UI
[08:37:58] <Mottie> ahhh ok
[08:38:58] <scott_gonzalez> Mottie: re: spinner outline; it looks the same on OS X (just blue)
[08:39:03] <scott_gonzalez> We don't mess with focus outlines in UI.
[08:39:12] <Mottie> ok

[09:35:05] <ajpiano> scott_gonzalez: can you just check that everything is kosher with the jqueryui demos on stage?
[09:36:00] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: They shouldn't be affected.
[09:36:04] <ajpiano> yeah i know
[09:36:12] <ajpiano> it's a point release of jquery, and seems fine to me
[09:36:15] <scott_gonzalez> stage.jqueryui.com is just spinning for me.
[09:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, no, the demos run in iframes.
[09:36:27] <scott_gonzalez> finally loaded
[09:37:24] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...why is this using jQuery 1.8.3 in the demos?
[09:39:05] <scott_gonzalez> Anyway, ajpiano, that change can't affect the jqueryui.com demos.
[09:40:19] <ajpiano> i wouldn't have thought so, but just wanted to double check cause of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/blob/master/themes/jquery/js/main.js#L115-L161
[09:40:21] <ajpiano> but anway
[09:40:26] <ajpiano> i'm gonna tag

[10:24:58] <ajpiano> i thought i did it in the right order

[10:25:13] <ajpiano> gonna just do it manually

[10:26:17] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: You didn't git push before git push -t ?
[10:26:25] <ajpiano> i did
[10:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[10:26:33] <ajpiano> wait
[10:26:38] <ajpiano> i pushed the commit
[10:26:41] <ajpiano> do i have to do
[10:27:03] <scott_gonzalez> `npm version && git push && git push --tags`
[10:27:05] <ajpiano> git commit -m "the actual commit"; npm version build; git push; git push -t;
[10:27:06] <ajpiano> ahhh
[10:27:10] <ajpiano> that's what i bungled
[10:27:23] <scott_gonzalez> The commit that it tries to checkout is the one created by `npm version`
[10:27:29] <ajpiano> ah
[10:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> I already filed an issue for gnarf to make this work properly if you do it in the wrong order.
[10:27:38] <ajpiano> the actual "v1.9.1-2" commit
[10:27:42] <scott_gonzalez> yup
