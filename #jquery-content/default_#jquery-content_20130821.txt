[08:01:13] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: can I pick your brain?
[08:02:01] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[08:02:04] <nacin> http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24994
[08:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> Give me a sec to look at the repo.
[08:03:28] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[08:03:58] <scott_gonzalez> So, new versions of jQuery use source maps.
[08:04:02] <nacin> We *don't* have that file. But even http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.js has @sourceMappingURL included, which is why I'm at the head-scratch stage.
[08:04:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but that's because the CDN has the source map: http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.10.2/jquery.min.map
[08:04:32] <nacin> I see.
[08:04:38] <nacin> So we should be stripping that line then.
[08:04:44] <scott_gonzalez> So you can either remove the line, or add the source map.
[08:04:56] <scott_gonzalez> The source map will get you sane debugging.
[08:05:06] <nacin> Right, got it. We may do the latter at some point soon, in the meantime we'll remove it.
[08:06:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's annoying that all users are going to start having the problem.
[08:07:47] <nacin> It seems like maps should only be downloaded on demand - otherwise it's an extra load on a website.
[08:08:42] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I don't think source maps were fully thought out.
[08:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> We've had lots of problems.
[11:09:49] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: also noticing #14225 - we rename jquery.min.js to jquery.js
[11:09:55] <nacin> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14225#comment:1
[11:11:37] <scott_gonzalez> nacin: Yeah, that won't matter since you're not using source maps.
[11:11:44] <scott_gonzalez> It's a bidirectional link.
[11:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> jquery.min.js references the source map by name.
[11:12:07] <scott_gonzalez> And the source map references the min file by name.
[11:12:13] <scott_gonzalez> It's a ridiculous system.
[11:18:11] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: got it. but either way including the map wouldn't have been enough.
[11:18:43] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
