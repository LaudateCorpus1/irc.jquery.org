[10:38:51] <carldanley> rworth: just want to confirm a couple of things with you in regards to the stuff we discussed last week
[10:38:53] <carldanley> https://github.com/jquery/blog.jquery.com
[10:39:19] <carldanley> ^ that is a blank repo waiting for the XML files from the other sites to be pushed here?
[10:41:26] <carldanley> cc: scott_gonzalez, ajpiano
[10:42:59] <scott_gonzalez> carldanley: Yes, though the readme is wrong, this won't use XML at all.
[10:44:03] <carldanley> so the idea is to move the content from the 3 blogs ( blog.jquery.com, blog.jqueryui.com, jquerymobile.com/blog ) into this repo? what format should it use if not XML ?
[10:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> mardown and/or HTML
[10:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> s/mardown/markdown/
[10:44:51] <scott_gonzalez> The only sites that use XML are API sites.
[10:45:04] <carldanley> ah ok perfect
[10:46:02] <carldanley> how am I generating/moving the content on those 3 sites?
[10:46:31] <carldanley> curious to see if you have something in place for this already. does it exist somewhere?
[10:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> We don't have anything in place.
[10:48:01] <scott_gonzalez> I was thinking we'd need to write a one-off script to handle the WordPress exports.
[11:28:38] <carldanley> does the content from any of those 3 sites exist anywhere like in a database?
[11:28:42] <carldanley> or are they static HTML files
[11:29:01] <carldanley> we can scrub the data from either of those things
[11:29:59] <carldanley> im hoping it exists in a DB so we can generate the XML files for each entry
[11:52:38] <scott_gonzalez> carldanley: They're in the normal WordPress databases.
[11:53:13] <scott_gonzalez> Richard got you a login for each site, right?
[11:54:48] <carldanley> oh sweet, awesome
[11:54:50] <carldanley> yes
[11:55:17] <carldanley> I'll export them then and write a conversion script to grab the content and format it into markdown
[11:55:25] <carldanley> this ok with you scott_gonzalez ^ ?
[11:56:09] <scott_gonzalez> sounds good carldanley
[11:58:22] <carldanley> scott_gonzalez: for all of the entries on the newly combined blog.jquery.com, we are using a unique slug right? with no date
[11:58:39] <carldanley> and in the repo, they need to live in an "entries" folder ?
[12:17:29] <gnarf> carldanley: might be worth separating them into sub-folders per project in the entries/
[12:17:31] <gnarf> like 
[12:17:41] <gnarf> entries/jquery/ entries/jquery-ui etc
[12:18:14] <gnarf> maybe we'd want to split em up by year too?
[12:18:16] <gnarf> i dunno
[12:18:22] <gnarf> thoughts ajpiano rworth scott_gonzalez
[12:24:08] <scott_gonzalez> We're only splitting by year.
[12:25:02] <scott_gonzalez> But yes, the URL will be just the slug, no date.
[13:42:59] <carldanley> scott_gonzalez: do you have an example markdown scaffold somewhere? I need something to match when exporting.
[13:59:11] <scott_gonzalez> carldanley: https://raw.github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/master/page/changelog/1.10.0.md
[14:59:54] <gnarf> kswedberg / ajpiano: I'm looking for someone to help me make the README.md on jQuery Color a better API document -- https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/blob/master/README.md
[15:47:11] <kswedberg> hey gnarf: just got back.
[15:47:44] <gnarf> kswedberg: i kinda half-assed that readme, and it could use some love to make it a more navigable api document i think
[15:48:28] <gnarf> there isn't enough API surface to warrant a site for it I don't think, but like how can we make nice API docs in the readme/github
[15:48:45] <kswedberg> k. I'll take a look tonight and see if I can do something to help.
[15:49:30] <gnarf> thanks
[19:34:44] <carldanley> scott_gonzalez: in the event that there are posts with the same name on import, do you want to append something to the slug?
[19:38:42] <carldanley> just going to log it for now, will deal with them manually, if there are any
