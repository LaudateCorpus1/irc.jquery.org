[09:01:01] <jquicommit> 13jqueryui.com/06master 143027e91 15J√∂rn Zaefferer: Move TJ up to team members, and order non-lead team members by last name
[13:06:54] <scott_gonzalez> What a mess: https://gist.github.com/4340437
[13:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Which is correct for jquery.org? jquery-foundation or jquery-project?
[13:18:24] <rworth> scott_gonzalez this a classname?
[13:18:56] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, body class
[13:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> I got a conflict on that in the merge.
[13:19:25] <rworth> of those two, jquery-foundation
[13:19:37] <rworth> we never use the term project for anything anymore
[13:19:42] <scott_gonzalez> thanks
[13:43:45] <scott_gonzalez> This merge is not going to be sane.
[13:43:55] <scott_gonzalez> I think I might be better off walking through all commits one by one.
[13:44:23] <scott_gonzalez> I think we need to abandon hope of being able to merge master into new-css.
[13:44:36] <scott_gonzalez> I'll just push forward and hope that master goes away at some point :-)
[13:45:03] <ryanneufeld> replace maser w/ new-css?
[13:45:18] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, but we can't do that right now.
[13:48:33] <ryanneufeld> yeah, forced history changes aren't great
[13:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> Oh good, only 75 commits to look through :-/
[13:53:02] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: binary search to find the oldest one without conflicts?
[13:53:22] <ryanneufeld> or rather newest one
[13:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> No, I just went back to the commit where new-css was created.
[13:53:48] <scott_gonzalez> I realized there may be commits that merge cleanly that we don't even want.
[13:53:55] <ryanneufeld> ah
[13:56:50] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...looks like rworth already did some of this work
[14:00:30] <rworth> oh yeah scott_gonzalez I did some merging a few weeks back
[14:00:59] <rworth> and I did it commit at a time
[14:02:10] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm walking through the history to see how far this goes and what was merged.
[14:02:27] <scott_gonzalez> So far I've knocked the first 25 commits off the list :-)
[14:02:37] <scott_gonzalez> So maybe this isn't so bad.
[14:04:27] <rworth> yeah, you should be able to jump big chunks that I jumped
[14:04:37] <rworth> caus I was sane and went in order
[14:04:55] <rworth> which suggests you could find the last commit I merged and start from there
[14:07:19] <scott_gonzalez> Well, you did miss a few commits.
[14:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm caught up.
[14:08:43] <scott_gonzalez> 32 commits to go through
[14:08:48] <scott_gonzalez> Much better than 75.
[14:18:06] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: Were you doing a lot of work on the learn site in master after you did the new-css work?
[14:18:47] <scott_gonzalez> I want to make sure I'm not doing something totally crazy right now.
