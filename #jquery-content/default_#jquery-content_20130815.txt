[11:09:17] <gnarf> nacin: yt?
[11:09:22] <nacin> gnarf: hi
[11:09:25] <gnarf> nacin: is there any reason not to also microcache 404?
[11:09:38] <nacin> dunno
[11:09:44] <gnarf> i mean, for the 2 minutes or whatever
[11:09:50] <gnarf> seems like it wouldn't be that bad
[11:09:51] <nacin> seems sane for your setup for sure.
[11:10:01] <gnarf> and if its a common 404, it should save a little processor
[11:10:52] <nacin> gnarf: if it's a common 404, it might also be good to know about it
[11:11:23] <nacin> gnarf: no issues here with caching 404. you could cache them for a shorter period of time, or even a longer period of time - just recognizing that pages and posts would not go live immediately
[11:12:06] <gnarf> yeah, i think i'm going to add 404 and go to 3m cache time
[11:12:13] <nacin> if you're getting a common 404 that you feel the need to cache, maybe *that's* the issue
[11:12:16] <gnarf> the cpu on that machine is finally starting to feel a little sluggish :)
[11:12:39] <nacin> gnarf: we should turn it into a properly load-balanced setup
[11:13:28] <nacin> if for example google is hitting a lot (they like to hit everything that even smells like a URL), then maybe cache googlebot for longer, say.

[11:54:37] <gnarf> nacin: Aug 15 11:54:15 jq01 suhosin[7425]: ALERT - script tried to increase memory_limit to 268435456 bytes which is above the allowed value (attacker '(IP)', file '/var/www/wordpress/wordpress/wp-includes/default-constants.php', line 45) 
[11:55:33] <nacin> that's probably not new?
[11:56:23] <nacin> scott_gonzalez: ^
[11:56:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, it's new.
[11:57:01] <scott_gonzalez> Because jQuery Mobile is fucking huge.
[11:57:20] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/fe2e1e56231206733f4b0e9b1f128352cf7617cc
[11:57:21] <b-ot> scott_gonzalez: Scott Gonz√°lez (2w 1d ago): Increase memory limit to 256M.
[11:57:27] <scott_gonzalez> We could go lower.
[11:57:33] <arschmitz> :(
[11:57:40] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery Mobile just has some large zips.
[11:57:45] <arschmitz> up
[11:57:47] <arschmitz> yup
[11:57:55] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: only needed for the xmlrpc tho right?
[11:57:57] <scott_gonzalez> And XML-RPC makes transferring files a bit expensive.
[11:58:01] <arschmitz> massive demo app with hi-res images
[11:58:14] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, just needed for XML-RPC.
[11:58:20] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: I could make a second pool of connections that has a higher memory limit and lower process limit for xml rpc connections only
[11:58:31] <scott_gonzalez> That works.
[11:58:53] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: probably can't get to it until next week - but I'll write up an issue about it
[11:58:56] <scott_gonzalez> grunt-wordpress doesn't do parallel requests anymore, so a small connection pool shouldn't be an issue.
[11:59:24] <gnarf> nacin: also - https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/195
[11:59:32] <gnarf> nacin: whats our best "upgrade method" for this?
[11:59:55] <gnarf> currently, i download the zip, unzip it and move /var/www/wordpress/wordpress out of the way and replace it with a new one
[11:59:58] <nacin> just do it
[12:00:02] <nacin> seems about right
[12:00:05] <gnarf> nacin: should we be using the wp-admin instead?
[12:00:09] <nacin> I thought I might have put a bin script somewhere
[12:00:21] <nacin> gnarf: ideally you just do git checkout 3.6-branch :-)
[12:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> I wasn't sure if we might miss some essential upgrade scripting at some ponit.
[12:01:03] <nacin> nope. you'll want to log into wp-admin after and run the "Upgrade Network" step but that's very minor
[12:03:52] <gnarf> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/196 - memory limit issue

[12:53:20] <scott_gonzalez> First week of September is fine.
[12:53:28] <scott_gonzalez> But I'll harass you ever day after that :-P
[12:54:31] <scott_gonzalez> I don't see anything that indicates that I am.
[12:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> Oy, that was not meant for this channel.
