[09:35:22] <agcolom> arthurvr: I'm not sure I did this right...
[09:36:51] <agcolom> gnarf: I think I did something wrong...??
[09:36:55] <arthurvr> agcolom: wait, kris did it too :p https://github.com/jquery/jquery.org/pull/106#issuecomment-126395152
[09:37:09] <agcolom> oh!
[09:37:32] <arthurvr> so the extra commits you introduced are totally useless, but itâ€™s not like you broke something :p 
[09:37:48] <agcolom> good!
[09:38:10] <agcolom> both seem to have happened pretty much at the same time!
[09:38:11] <arthurvr> Doesnâ€™t matter anyway as theyâ€™ll be squashed together when landing them on master :) 
[09:38:19] <agcolom> good.
[09:38:21] <agcolom> thanks!
[09:38:32] <gnarf> I'll rebase it out of the way
[09:38:35] <arthurvr> few seconds later, yeah =) 
[09:38:40] <arthurvr> gnarf: yay :)
[09:39:29] <agcolom> Thanks all :-)

[09:40:38] <gnarf> agcolom: thanks for taking some time to answer those last things
[09:40:50] <gnarf> agcolom: I'm just back from TXJS so my work days are hellish atm
[09:40:54] <agcolom> no problem :-) 
[09:41:34] <agcolom> I'm on holiday but will have a bit of time each day as we'll not be doing much apart from just relaxing :-)
[09:42:06] <arthurvr> Yay for open source holidays
[09:42:22] <agcolom> :-) 
[09:43:02] <arthurvr> On a related note: Iâ€™m unavailable from the 3rd to the 17th august.
[09:43:26] <arthurvr> should probably write it on that last mailing list message too
[09:46:24] <kborchers> lol sorry all!
[09:46:40] <kborchers> agcolom: i thought you were away for some reason so figured i would take care of it :)
[09:46:52] <agcolom> no. no problem :-)
[09:46:55] <agcolom> Thanks :-)

[10:07:09] <gnarf> arthurvr: LGTM - Side note - I should try to setup a "top 404s" report
[10:07:19] <gnarf> so we can look for things that should have redirects

[10:16:32] * gnarf grumbles
[10:17:25] <gnarf> arthurvr: http://bit.ly/1H6Zkuk added it to reports as 404 requests report
[10:18:38] <gnarf> you can go to "edit -> open in source" and filter by domain if you want
[10:19:50] <arthurvr> gnarf: Cool :) 
[10:20:16] <arthurvr> Iâ€™ll dig into these but Iâ€™m going to do that separately from moving the ones in the infra repo.
[10:20:42] <gnarf> like you can make the stuff on the left sourcetype=access_combined status=404 source=*api.jquery.com*
[10:22:56] <arthurvr> gnarf: Alright. There was another one I wanted your thoughts on: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/pull/276. Looks like /api.xml never gets requested, though /API (notice uppercase) does. How do I handle this one?
[10:23:19] <arthurvr> Do I add both a redirect for /api and /API (wasnâ€™t like that in the nginx config too)
[10:23:38] <gnarf> is it giving 404's currently for /API ?
[10:23:54] <arthurvr> http://api.jqueryui.com/API seems like it
[10:23:56] <gnarf> yeah - it is, I say we keep it
[10:24:06] <arthurvr> keep it on 404 or keep the page working?
[10:24:24] <arthurvr> I think we should make it stay 404ing.
[10:24:28] <gnarf> yeah
[10:24:32] <arthurvr> alright
[10:24:45] <arthurvr> gnarf: than that PR should be good to go too?
[10:24:51] <gnarf> yup
[10:25:46] <arthurvr> gnarf: can you comment your a :+1: on the ticket so I donâ€™t forget? (If it looks good of course :)) 
[10:25:52] <arthurvr> Same thing for https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/pull/782, I guess.
