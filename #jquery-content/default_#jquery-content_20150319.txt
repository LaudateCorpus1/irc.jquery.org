[00:21:05] <in-arena> i was planning to track issues on github using crontab. The only problem i face is that theres no option for real time tracking as and when the issue is created. Is there a need of real-time updating in this project ??
[00:22:33] <in-arena> also what should be the first priority : quick update to data or deep Analysis of issues ??
[00:24:25] <in-arena> insights ??

[03:12:36] <AurelioDeRosa> Hi
[04:44:46] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think people realize that they're asking questions in the middle of the night for most of us and then leaving.
[05:55:23] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: im sure your right nearly all of the people iv talked to are in india
[05:56:28] <arschmitz> which is almost exactly opposite in time of day for most of us

[12:18:17] <akshay> Hii..i am interesting to do this project and i am IT student of cluster innovation centre, university of delhi.
[13:18:31] <sigorilla> Hi, agcolom! I changed my proposal. Can you read it again and discuss, please?
[13:19:32] <agcolom> sigorilla: Hi, yes, I will have a look in a bit. I am busy for the next 30 mins or so...
[13:20:06] <sigorilla> Sure, no problem!
[13:27:37] <akshay> hi,can you give me some tips...how to write a better proposal?please suggest me some references that you know.
[13:29:24] <sigorilla> akshay, you can find information on this page: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List
[13:30:02] <sigorilla> In the first paragraph the basic information
[13:33:48] <akshay> thanks
[13:50:31] <bepolite> Hello
[13:50:44] <bepolite> agcolom, Which DBMS is usually used for Jquery Projects?
[14:38:21] <agcolom> gnarf: ^ would you recommend a database in particular for the content GSOC projects?
[14:51:32] <agcolom> sigorilla: Could you please add more details to your timeline?  
[14:52:04] <agcolom> In the database, you will need to record other info. For example, hints.
[14:53:35] <agcolom> The task will be composed of a description, some code, the solution, hints.
[14:54:36] <agcolom> and there ccould be more than one step to complete the task, so we need to think whether this should be one task with several steps or each step is a task...
[14:57:40] <sigorilla> Well, I'll write timeline in more details and change scheme.
[14:58:20] <agcolom> Thanks!
[14:58:58] <sigorilla> By the way, if user will be able to do task correctly, but with different solution. How can we verify this result?
[14:59:38] <sigorilla> Thank you for your attention to our proposals!
[15:00:01] <agcolom> yes, I was wondering this as well. I think we will have to be either very prescriptive with the description and guide the user towards a single solution
[15:00:37] <agcolom> or if there are more than one solution, all solutions will have to be recorded and acceptable
[15:02:09] <agcolom> we also need a "reward" when the user completes a task successfully. This can be a simple message. We need to decide whether this should be task specific or whether this should be the same for all tasks
[15:04:03] <agcolom> in addition, we could have a guess for what the user might type and offer messages
[15:05:07] <sigorilla> We can add field in DB for message after complite tasks
[15:05:15] <agcolom> if they do something wrong... for example, if they correctly select an element but select the wrong element...
[15:05:25] <agcolom> sure, sounds good.
[15:06:20] <agcolom> I think we could also have a description of step by step to complete a task
[15:06:30] <sigorilla> How about checking the result of the code work, not the code itself?
[15:06:49] <agcolom> how do you mean?
[15:08:58] <agcolom> so for example, we ask the user to change the color of a paragraph to red, did you mean to check afterwards whether the color is red instead of checking the line of code that we would expect them to write?
[15:09:42] <bepolite> Will there be an admin section for managing tasks?
[15:09:59] <sigorilla> For example, user should change color of tag H1. Solution: $("h1").css("color", "red"), but $("h1").attr("style", "color: red;"); is solution too.
[15:10:52] <sigorilla> Oh, it's bad idea, imho... 
[15:10:59] <bepolite> Well I think that may vary according to the Objective of the task
[15:12:32] <agcolom> bepolite: If we're looking at adding this to the current articles, so I'd say no need for an admin panel. However, if it's stand alone it could be good. 
[15:12:33] <sigorilla> Oh, I miss your answer... You understood me exactly.
[15:12:40] <bepolite> agcolom, Will it be a nice idea if we gamify the whole process
[15:13:08] <agcolom> bepolite: yes, this was not my initial idea, but I'm open to it
[15:13:20] <bepolite> eg giving points to users when they answer tasks correctly, awarding badges when they answer many tasks etc?
[15:14:01] <agcolom> bepolite: yes, that'd be good to have. It makes everything more complex though, but if you're up to it, it would be great.
[15:14:48] <agcolom> sigorilla: this is where we could direct the user by specifying which method they should use
[15:16:03] <sigorilla> It's reasonable. I agree with you.
[15:17:21] <bepolite> agcolom, Is  this project meant to teach the users or is it meant to test their knowledge of Jquery?
[15:18:03] <agcolom> teach them 
[15:18:13] <sigorilla> Should DB remember users? Or can we use cookies for this?
[15:18:57] <agcolom> I'm not sure... 
[15:19:27] <bepolite> Okay if that Is the case then I think the tutorials have to be well structured such that a user following them should be able to learn progressively
[15:20:05] <agcolom> yes
[15:21:46] <agcolom> sorry guys... have to go... 
[15:22:06] <sigorilla> thanks! Good buy!
[15:22:06] <bepolite> Okay have a great evening
[15:23:15] <agcolom> thanks! have a good evening also (although it must be very late for you?)
[15:23:48] <bepolite> I think we have the same time zone  (if you still live in london)
