[08:24:21] <arthurvr> scott_gonzalez: ping
[08:24:55] <arthurvr> wanted to talk about https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/602#issuecomment-68718541
[08:24:59] <arthurvr> (about your last comment)
[08:25:30] <jqcommit> [13jquery-wp-content] 15scottgonzalez closed pull request #302: High resolution favicon (06master...06master) 02http://git.io/WC5PTA
[08:26:02] <arthurvr> In some way I think youâ€™re true, but thinking about it more and more seems like no solution is both maintanable and valuable
[08:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> Why not? A simple sentence like "The article originally appeared on <link>." seems fine.
[08:27:58] <scott_gonzalez> For now, I'm fine with what you've done.
[08:28:07] <scott_gonzalez> Since we're not properly using the source information anyway.
[08:28:43] <scott_gonzalez> For example, http://learn.jquery.com/effects/queue-and-dequeue-explained/ comes from http://jqueryfordesigners.com/api-queue-dequeue/
[08:28:53] <scott_gonzalez> But there's nothing indicating that.
[08:29:04] <scott_gonzalez> The info exists in the metadata, via the article's source field.
[08:29:13] <scott_gonzalez> But since there's no attribution field, nothing gets displayed.
[08:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> So we're already doing this wrong, which is why I'm fine with us continuing to do it wrong for now.
[08:29:39] <arthurvr> yes but do you believe that will stay valuable in the future? I mean, on the long term articles wil get updated and updated till nothing of the original content is there anymore.
[08:32:54] <arthurvr> on the about page we could include something like, many of the articles were originally written by â€¦ and then people that really wrote MUCH. which IMO is more valuable.
[08:33:01] <arthurvr> it just that we shouldnâ€™t state that something is written by somebody, if we after time just replaced kinda everything
[08:33:04] <scott_gonzalez> That ignores the legality issues.
[08:33:54] <arthurvr> must it be there for legal reasons? Because then thereâ€™s indeed to way out
[08:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> As I said, I don't know how the content was obtained.
[08:34:52] <scott_gonzalez> I was not involved in the population of content for this site.
[08:35:15] <arthurvr> Somebody that knows this kind of stuff?
[08:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> Well, Addy Osmani added this specific article: https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/commit/0f9e7e023c32a368b7f1600ed7312cae47cbfd4a
[08:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> Presumably ajpiano knows how we obtained content.
[08:36:52] <scott_gonzalez> Interestingly, this article used to have attribution, but it doesn't anymore.
[08:38:04] <ajpiano> none of the attribution stuff is there for legal reasons
[08:38:07] <ajpiano> it's all there for feel good reasons
[08:38:09] <arthurvr> that article is changed in every possible way.
[08:38:16] <scott_gonzalez> RWhitbeck removed it: https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/commit/f3ebf9d17b4966b884c8224c836dc94e474e4ab1#diff-19
[08:38:28] <ajpiano> so that people who made stuff and helped with the site would be able to like, have tangible evidence they did
[08:38:48] <ajpiano> it may very well be that that is kind of hard to track and also not neceessary to do in the first place
[08:38:48] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: So do we have proof that the content was all provided to us under MIT?
[08:39:19] <ajpiano> but that's the context of why we did it
[08:39:29] <ajpiano> i'm not sure what you mean by "proof"
[08:39:58] <ajpiano> hmm
[08:40:04] <scott_gonzalez> For example, given https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/commit/0f9e7e023c32a368b7f1600ed7312cae47cbfd4a how do we know that Remy said we could publish this on learn.jquery.com?
[08:40:06] <ajpiano> for jqf, the license is actually CC
[08:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> Well, license for jQF doesn't matter. We own it.
[08:40:34] <scott_gonzalez> Rebecca transferred it to us.
[08:40:45] <ajpiano> ah right
[08:40:54] <ajpiano> idon't remember, i reckon it was a verbal/email agreement
[08:41:40] <scott_gonzalez> We should go through all the articles with a source and make sure we actually have the rights to be including it.
[08:42:31] <arthurvr> In fact thatâ€™s something that should have happened earlier right?
[08:42:32] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[08:42:32] <arthurvr> :-(
[08:42:37] <ajpiano> we ddfiniteiyl reached out ot people
[08:42:42] <ajpiano> at the time we included these things
[08:42:49] <ajpiano> i definitely recall that
[08:46:23] <jqcommit> [13jquery-wp-content] 15scottgonzalez tagged 06v4.0.4 at 145afd3d0: 02http://git.io/DaOdfA
[08:50:45] <arthurvr> conclusion? To go over every article then?
[08:51:07] <arthurvr> regarding the attributions on the pages I still donâ€™t think thereâ€™s a perfect solution.
[08:51:32] <arthurvr> But if it must really happen for legal reasons then Iâ€™m fine with it.
