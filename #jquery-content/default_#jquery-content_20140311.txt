[05:35:49] <scott_gonzalez> thorst: Just started my day, about to transfer the plugin for you.
[05:36:22] <thorst> sweet. Thanks
[05:36:56] <thorst> should i delete my 1.0.0 tag first?
[05:37:15] <scott_gonzalez> thorst: No, it won't reprocess the tag either way.
[05:37:25] <thorst> ok
[05:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> Transfer complete.
[05:39:20] <scott_gonzalez> We really need to implement the ability to re-process tag failures like this one.
[05:40:12] <thorst> so ill just create another tag 1.0.1 and then it should push over, correct
[05:40:15] <scott_gonzalez> We don't reprocess any tags because we want to strongly discourage people from ever re-creating a tag.
[05:40:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yup, just make sure to update the version in the manifest file as well.
[05:40:51] <scott_gonzalez> But in this case, it'd be nice to reprocess it since the problem was just the owner.
[05:43:41] <thorst> the update pushed
[05:44:03] <thorst> but it doesnt look like wathcers and forks updated

[11:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano: Did we not record all the videos in Portland?
[11:34:13] <scott_gonzalez> There are a lot of talks that don't have video links on http://events.jquery.org/2013/portland/
[11:34:45] <scott_gonzalez> Also, the slide and video links aren't very accessible. They contain no text at all (not even
[11:56:43] <ajpiano> yeah, we're doing a better job of putthing that together this time around, i think i can have isaacdurazo go back and fix up portland
