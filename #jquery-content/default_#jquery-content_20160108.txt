[11:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> kswedberg: So there were some updates to support the new version of WordPress.
[11:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> I think api.jquery.com and api.jquerymobile.com are always failing now.
[11:09:06] <scott_gonzalez> When I get some time, I'll try downgrading the xmlrpc module and see if that helps.
[11:10:19] <kswedberg> huh. ok. is there something I can do in the meantime to see changes locally?
[11:14:45] <kswedberg> scott_gonzalez â†‘
[11:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> Well, the only thing I know for sure will work is downgrading everything, including WordPress.
[11:19:10] <scott_gonzalez> Which isn't too easy with jquery-wp-content
[11:19:14] <scott_gonzalez> But...
[11:19:33] <scott_gonzalez> You can just open the file from the dist directory.
[11:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> The generated HTML is there, but there's no layout or CSS.
[11:22:28] <kswedberg> I'll try that. thx
