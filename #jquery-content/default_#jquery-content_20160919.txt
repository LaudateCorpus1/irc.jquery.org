[12:17:22] <m_gol> scott_gonzalez arschmitz agcolom: is there any reason why we couldn't update our sites to jQuery 3.1? They all still use 1.11.3
[12:20:19] <scott_gonzalez> Should be fine, assuming every site's JS is 3.x compatible.
[12:20:34] <m_gol> yeah, we've just noticed one reason is we first need to remove examples for removed APIs
[12:22:14] <m_gol> (or just not update the jQuery version used in them since they're in iframes)
