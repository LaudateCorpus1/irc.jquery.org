[01:35:14] <codepunker> Greetings gentlemen. I have a question regarding a plugin that somehow is no longer listed on plugins.jquery.com after being published a few days ago. Should I follow specific rules to ask this question ?
[01:41:02] <codepunker> Anyway, if someone can help me I would really appreciate it. The plugin is https://github.com/the-codepunker/magnifyMe. The error_log shows that it was added successfully on sept 23rd. http://plugins.jquery.com/error.log. I am just curios if I did something wrong so that I can fix it. Again ,thanks to anyone who can help.
[02:58:04] <codepunker> Also ... just so you know. Validate js responds with a 404 not found
[05:36:12] <scott_gonzalez> codepunker: I think we lost about a week's worth of releases due to the server rebuild.
[05:36:26] <scott_gonzalez> Try going into the web hook settings and sending a test hook.
[05:44:06] <codepunker> I got it scott
[05:44:12] <codepunker> Thank you so much for your help
[05:48:50] <codepunker> It says: Okay, the test payload is on its way.
[06:10:38] <codepunker> Thank you <scott_gonzalez> I fixed it with a retag
