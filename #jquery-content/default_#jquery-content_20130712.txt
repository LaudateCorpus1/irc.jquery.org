[02:12:49] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: kswedberg: Sorry if I seem a bit OCD over consistency :-) I would like us to agree on whether within the api docs links to other api docs pages should be relative or absolute. We have a combination of both. I would be in favor of relative URLs so that if we're checking on local or stage, we go to the correct corresponding place and not the live page... what do you think?
[02:15:15] <agcolom> I'm referring to cases where an event in the api docs mentions another event so event.preventDefault would ref to event.isDefaultPrevented, etc. 
[02:15:39] <agcolom> that one for example uses relative urls and I think this is what we want...

[05:42:46] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Absolute URLs will work on stage and local.
[05:42:58] <scott_gonzalez> But, the answer is: rooted relative URLs for same site.
[05:48:24] <kswedberg> agcolom: for color hex values, I prefer the same as you: lowercase and shortened form (3-digit) when possible
[05:50:06] <kswedberg> agcolom: +1 to scott_gonzalez's answer about standardizing on "root relative" URLs, e.g. /addClass/

[07:35:03] <scott_gonzalez> ajpiano rworth: Can we please remove Chosen from the jQuery sites?
[07:35:18] <scott_gonzalez> We're using it to collapse the nav into a select.
[07:35:25] <scott_gonzalez> For mobile devices.
[07:35:44] <scott_gonzalez> But mobile devices already have good UI/UX for native selects.
[07:36:08] <ajpiano> i thought we were alreaedy just creating a normal select
[07:36:13] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[07:36:23] <scott_gonzalez> So you have no objection to just going to a native select?
[07:36:45] <ajpiano> oh i think we may have been doing that in the portland site
[07:36:52] <ajpiano> collapsing to a native select
[07:37:09] <ajpiano> yea i tend to agree we should use native select
[07:37:58] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:38:02] <scott_gonzalez> This was a pretty massive addition: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/7f2d8c5820fb849f5d588ae2f94e332231631622

[08:07:34] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: kswedberg: I meant we want to remove absolute URLs which are like http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation and just have /event.stopPropagation instead
[08:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: That's what we said.
[08:09:02] <agcolom> good :-)
[08:09:04] <scott_gonzalez> Note that all URLs must have a trailing slash.
[08:09:12] <scott_gonzalez>  /event.stopPropagation/
[08:09:12] <agcolom> ok
[08:09:31] <agcolom> right. will change that now.... I think it might be missing in a few places....
[08:12:07] <kswedberg> thx, agcolom 
[08:12:19] <agcolom> no problem :-)
