[00:13:39] <agcolom> pulkit: we have a getting started page for students at https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students
[05:09:21] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Whenever the proposals come in for that tracking issue, I'd like to see them.
[08:12:48] <jacquerie> scott_gonzalez, I've started working on mine. I'm currently experimenting with a Node.js library for GitHub's API: https://github.com/jacquerie/what-can-i-do-for.
[08:13:13] <jacquerie> scott_gonzalez, what do you mean with "Track opens and closes, not just total open count"?
[08:13:44] <scott_gonzalez> jacquerie: We already have one that we use: https://www.npmjs.com/package/github-request
[08:15:34] <scott_gonzalez> You might want to look at https://github.com/scottgonzalez/github-export
[08:19:59] <jacquerie> Interesting. I implemented my own solution for pagination, but github-request's one is much nicer. I will check later the other library. Thanks!

[10:09:28] <parth1994> Hi, my name is Parth Sharma. I am very much interested in the project- Interactive tutorials for learn and other sites. Please suggest me some task related to this project before I submit my proposal.
[10:10:21] <arthurvr> parth1994: related to the learning center or to jQuery in general? You can always go take a look at https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues.
[10:11:37] <parth1994> Since I was interested in this project specifically, I would prefer some task directly related to this particular project.
[10:12:42] <arthurvr> Well basically every issue that does not have an open PR yet :) Anything specific youâ€™re interested in writing about?
[10:14:08] <arthurvr> parth1994: Weâ€™re all hanging out in this channel so feel free to ask any questions.
[10:16:55] <arthurvr> parth1994: also be sure to read up on http://contribute.jquery.org/
[10:17:52] <parth1994> I was wondering since this is a completely new project idea, working on some of the issues in the link given by you would be helpful.
[10:19:05] <parth1994> I have previous experience with jquery. And I made a project almost entirely using jquery.
[10:23:44] <arthurvr> parth1994: In fact I feel like you should just go pick a ticket. All of them are easy to jump in. I can make some suggestions tho
[10:25:11] <parth1994> Yes please. Thanks :)
[10:26:47] <arthurvr> parth1994: https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/64 maybe?
[10:27:22] <arthurvr> parth1994: Or https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/issues/335.
[10:29:58] <parth1994> arthurvr: Okay i'll look into these. Thanks :)
[10:30:51] <arthurvr> parth1994: Thanks. If you would have any questions, weâ€™re here :)
[10:39:04] <sigorilla> Hi, everyone! I am also interested in jQuery project under GSoC. With what should I start with? Also should I get email after submitting the form of CLA? Or is check occur automatically after PR?
[10:40:50] <arthurvr> sigorilla: https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students is a good start :)
[10:44:51] <sigorilla> Thanks. And if I confirm the form of CLA, should I get some infomation about verifying of my request?
[10:46:18] <arthurvr> Not sure but I donâ€™t think so :)
[10:53:02] <sigorilla> It's clear. Thank you
