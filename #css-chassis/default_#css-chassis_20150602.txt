[09:00:20] <sfrisk> mini gsoc meeting time!
[09:00:25] <geekman-rohit> yay
[09:00:27] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, arschmitz
[09:00:28] <geekman-rohit> hey
[09:01:06] <arschmitz> hi
[09:01:40] <geekman-rohit> so we decided to use POST with a db during last meeting
[09:01:55] <sfrisk> so I'm going to try and participate today - but I'm super behind with work and fixing some fires, so my answering of questions might be a little sporadic
[09:02:22] <geekman-rohit> I was hoping we could take some decisions today about layout/ wireframe and ui features / tools
[09:02:45] <geekman-rohit> me and arschitz agreed on using jquery-mobile on his advice some time ago
[09:03:54] <arschmitz> not mobile
[09:03:56] <arschmitz> ui
[09:04:03] <arschmitz> you dont need all the nav stuff from mobile
[09:04:37] <geekman-rohit> oh ui it shall be, but what would we need ui for
[09:05:08] <geekman-rohit> we still need a way to do layout, until chassis's own is done, when we can switch to use that
[09:06:02] <arschmitz> Yeah should probably just use a biasic grid
[09:06:06] <arschmitz> that could be replaced
[09:06:22] <arschmitz> as chassis will exist by the time this goes to production
[09:06:40] <sfrisk> yup
[09:07:25] <geekman-rohit> how about till then we keep layout code in a separate file and do it with absolute/relative postioning and percentages?
[09:07:28] <geekman-rohit> something simple
[09:07:47] <arschmitz> or you could just pick a drop in grid
[09:07:53] <arschmitz> that way you dont waste time
[09:07:59] <geekman-rohit> external framework
[09:08:02] <geekman-rohit> ?
[09:08:05] <arschmitz> yes
[09:08:20] <arschmitz> for development i like www.linkedin.com/in/arschmitz
[09:08:22] <arschmitz> oops
[09:08:26] <arschmitz> ha ha my paste is busted
[09:08:27] <geekman-rohit> :D
[09:08:33] <arschmitz> been doing it all morning
[09:08:35] <arschmitz> anyway
[09:08:42] <arschmitz> http://flexboxgrid.com
[09:08:42] <sfrisk> sending people your linkedin address?
[09:08:59] <sfrisk> oo that's cool
[09:09:10] <arschmitz> its by Christopher
[09:09:30] <geekman-rohit> that is good! yay
[09:10:03] <arschmitz> we could not use in production because of browser support
[09:10:11] <arschmitz> but its super simple for making stuff quick
[09:10:35] <geekman-rohit> i dont think it supports ie 8 and 9
[09:10:42] <arschmitz> correct
[09:10:52] <arschmitz> thats why we could not use it in production
[09:10:57] <geekman-rohit> oh its fine, we will move to chassis anyways i guess
[09:11:01] <geekman-rohit> yep
[09:11:16] <arschmitz> but for prototyping its fine
[09:11:29] <geekman-rohit> +1 to that, yes
[09:11:47] <geekman-rohit> so I have new tools to play with while we get the wireframe decided on
[09:14:13] <sfrisk> my week should be a little less hectic after Wednesday ( I hope ), so I can help you out with that
[09:14:44] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[09:21:45] <geekman-rohit> i guess that answers my queries for now
[09:21:52] <geekman-rohit> thanks for your time everyone!
[09:23:29] <sfrisk> awesome!
[10:03:43] <sfrisk> hey guys, give me like give minutes
