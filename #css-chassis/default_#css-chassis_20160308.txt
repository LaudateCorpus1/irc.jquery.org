[05:49:24] <nashvail> Hey! Can someone tell if this pen http://codepen.io/nashvail/pen/WwrBvO helps fixing this issue https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/10. I have used the colors as described in the repo.
[05:57:15] <geekman-rohit> nashvail .. it addresses the issue
[05:58:04] <geekman-rohit> But you will have to improve it and have more states
[05:58:20] <geekman-rohit> Showing how inputs looks on error.. on success.. etc.
[05:58:29] <geekman-rohit> Also how error message itself is styled
[06:00:50] <geekman-rohit> If you wish to contribute. . Start a pull request.  Easier for the team to review and comment
[06:01:10] <nashvail> Alright, working on that. Will it be a good idea to just focus on text fields right now or also the checkboxes and radio buttons
[06:02:35] <nashvail> geekman-rohit: I have created a new CSS file and a a new HTML file in the demos folder. Can I start a PR with that directory structure?
[06:02:59] <geekman-rohit> We use scss .. not direct css
[06:03:34] <geekman-rohit> You will have to go through the existing code and see how we do it
[06:04:36] <nashvail> Already went through scss files. I will create a new scss file for this then
