[10:43:55] <arschmitz> HA HA AH
[10:45:10] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i guess we could go with performance.css-chassis.com but thats long
[10:45:43] <arschmitz> sfrisk: ^^
[10:45:48] <jzaefferer> seems fine to me
[10:45:53] <sfrisk> lol
[10:46:22] <arschmitz> i dont really think there is an issue with perf its SOOO common but i don't really care if people think its an issue
[10:47:23] <sfrisk> just be sure if you say it out loud you indicate it's with an 'f' and not a 'v'
[10:51:39] <arschmitz> :-)
[10:52:35] <arschmitz> i shal always spell it in conversation for clarity :-) "please go to P ...E ...R...F .css-chassis.com"
[11:51:16] <sfrisk> P to the E to the R to the F.  CSS Chassis dot Com!
