[08:34:51] <hiren_> I'm thinking to develop one small demo wordpress theme before submitting gsoc proposal.
[08:35:17] <hiren_> Is there any documentation available for classes and ids details OR
[08:35:33] <hiren_> I'll have to go through css files?
[08:40:29] <GreatDanton> hiren_, ask sfrisk
[08:41:46] <hiren_> Okay GreatDanton
[08:42:10] <GreatDanton> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues
[08:42:15] <GreatDanton> this might help you as well
[08:42:45] <arschmitz> hiren_: there are no css files with classes
[08:42:46] <hiren_> Yes I've gone through few issues.
[08:43:01] <arschmitz> hiren_: we have not even chosen our class structure yet
[08:46:29] <arschmitz> hiren_: so while you could make a wordpress theme its not possible to make one that has anything to do with chassis
[08:49:09] <sfrisk> arschmitz, you could have it start out with the base css framework
[08:49:23] <sfrisk> but if they do a theme they would have to work on developing the UI components for said theme
[08:49:28] <arschmitz> sfrisk: we dont have a base css framework yet
[08:49:37] <sfrisk> the goal is to have that by late may
[08:49:49] <arschmitz> sfrisk: hiren_ asked about doing it BEFORE her application
[08:49:57] <arschmitz> which would be right now
[08:50:06] <sfrisk> ooooh
[08:50:07] <sfrisk> Okay
[08:50:20] <sfrisk> yeah, you can't do a demo on with Chassis right now, since there would be nothing to use
[08:50:58] <sfrisk> but if you could do something to show your familiarity with wordpress theming
[08:51:13] <sfrisk> that could work
[08:51:49] <hiren_> sfrisk: arschmitz  got it
[08:52:08] <arschmitz> hiren_: that would also show your familiarity with css in general
[08:52:11] <sfrisk> like use that base _s theme we talked about, and then create your own designed theme
[08:52:20] <hiren_> I've developed one small wordpress theme
[08:52:29] <arschmitz> hiren_: if you really want to go all out do it with bem
[08:52:41] <arschmitz> since thats what we are considdering using
[08:56:43] <sfrisk> what arschmitz said
[08:58:56] <hiren_> arschmitz: okay got it.
[08:59:35] <hiren_> sfrisk: didnt get your last sentense.
[08:59:59] <sfrisk> I was agreeing with arschmitz
[09:00:43] <sfrisk> Okay, I need to get going, I'll be around for questions later
[09:00:58] <GreatDanton> cya
[09:01:45] <hiren_> SFrisk thank you
[09:03:29] <GreatDanton> I found this on css styleguide: Use lower case letters when declaring hex codes.
[09:03:37] <GreatDanton> why is that necessary?
[09:03:43] <arschmitz> consistency
[09:04:37] <arschmitz> GreatDanton: the point of the style guide is to make sure everything is consistent no matter who writes it
[09:05:10] <GreatDanton> ah ok, but in general it doesnt matter if that's lowercase or uppercase
[09:27:39] <exacs> Hello. I'm interested on this project for GSoC2015. Am I in the right place to ask some questions?
[12:00:54] <sfrisk> exacs: yes, this is the right place to ask questions!
