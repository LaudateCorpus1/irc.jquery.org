[09:20:42] <ramasilveyra> Today there is a meeting in #jquery-meeting?
[09:23:09] <arthurvr> Yes, I think so.
[09:23:29] <arthurvr> http://meetings.jquery.org/
[09:36:55] <ramasilveyra> Okay, but ...
[09:37:46] <arthurvr> ramasilveyra: but what?
[09:38:18] <marestad> Yes. There'sdefinitely a meeting.
[09:38:52] <arschmitz> there is always a meeting tuesdays at 1pm est
[09:39:22] <arschmitz> unless its a holiday or something
[09:47:57] <GreatDanton> yes it's the same for est, but I dont remember having meetings at 7o'clock (Europe)
[09:48:17] <arthurvr> Thatâ€™s right. Day light savings.
[09:49:11] <marestad> Yeah. I wish the meeting times were posted in UTC rather than on an admittedly convenient calendar.
[09:49:26] <marestad> My brain is entirely stuck in UTC.
[09:49:40] <arthurvr> for people in europe the meeting is an hour later indeed.
[09:49:53] <arthurvr> http://meetings.jquery.org/ is google calendar so normally switches to the right time zone
[09:50:03] <marestad> Did the time really change with Daylight savings?
[09:50:13] <GreatDanton> it seems so
[09:50:16] <marestad> Ugh.
[09:50:52] <arthurvr> it did
[10:03:04] <arthurvr> time to get started I guess :)
[10:03:07] <sfrisk> one sec
[10:03:17] <sfrisk> sorry, was helping out a co-worker
[10:03:41] <marestad> lol Calendar told me it's in 2 hours. (thanks to my rad proxy)
[10:03:55] <marestad> *the google calendar
[10:04:08] <arschmitz> it lies
[10:04:14] <marestad> Yep.
[10:05:06] <sfrisk> Meeting time!
[11:02:33] <marestad> Has prop order been brought up?
[11:02:44] <marestad> (just curious)
[11:02:56] <arschmitz> its being inforced with csscomb already
[11:03:07] <arschmitz> enforced
[11:03:09] <marestad> Cool.
[11:03:19] <marestad> Group ordering?
[11:03:30] <marestad> Or CSScomb default?
[11:03:45] <marestad> (which is a type of group ordering IIRC)
[11:04:26] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/blob/master/.csscomb.json
[11:04:49] <marestad> Yep. default.
[11:05:16] <marestad> Here's a version I roughly mocked up for an A8c project: https://cloudup.com/ce1TOtyjXXA
[11:05:56] <marestad> But that's what a custom setup would look like.
[11:07:17] <arschmitz> marestad: there is one used by topcoat thats super effecient
[11:07:20] <arschmitz> i need to look it up
[11:07:28] <marestad> That's the one I'd love to see.
[11:16:49] <arschmitz> marestad: https://en.bem.info/tools/optimizers/csso//
[11:17:16] <sfrisk> also, marestad, on the whole pallet styling thing
[11:17:25] <marestad> Colors?
[11:17:41] <sfrisk> well it kinda goes towards form element stuff
[11:17:49] <marestad> Yep.
[11:17:51] <sfrisk> I'm kinda leaning towards liking the buttons for material design in theory, although I don't like the ink touch events
[11:17:57] <marestad> And some base type settings.
[11:18:00] <sfrisk> I was playing with it in codepen the other day
[11:19:41] <sfrisk> http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/myvzPO
[11:19:58] <sfrisk> I do like the idea of raised vs flat buttons
[11:20:05] <marestad> Hmm.
[11:20:14] <marestad> Gonna fork the heck out of that.
[11:20:31] <sfrisk> I used the roboto font instead of the one you've got
[11:20:43] <marestad> Eh. Fonts will change.
[11:20:50] <marestad> Buttons will look about the same across fonts.
[11:20:59] <sfrisk> since mostly I was trying to see how close I could get to what was on the Material Design document, considering they only show each state as an image
[11:21:25] <sfrisk> but I did like having a different color for active, focused, hover, regular
[11:21:27] <marestad> Right.
[11:21:38] <sfrisk> and I think it keeps arschmitz happy on the accessibility front
[11:22:02] <arschmitz> i dont think we should "copy" material design but its fine to take inspiration that will link us to closely to them
[11:22:15] <marestad> Sure.
[11:22:18] <sfrisk> I don't think we should copy it, there are definitely parts I don't agree with
[11:22:36] <marestad> I'm pretty against drop shadows.
[11:22:50] <marestad> Well, I'm against box shadows)
[11:22:51] <sfrisk> drop shadows I think really depend on the design
[11:23:00] <marestad> They can wreck performance.
[11:23:07] <arschmitz> yup
[11:23:55] <sfrisk> agreed
[11:24:20] <sfrisk> doesn't stop them from being used though
[11:24:36] <marestad> Either way. I really like buttons.
[11:25:33] <marestad> There's an f-bomb on the following link, but it's super fun: http://codepen.io/MichaelArestad/pen/FzoxI
[11:25:37] <sfrisk> My life lately has been buttons and form elements - I like to try and find a way to make them fun
[11:25:49] <marestad> I also really like inputs.
[11:26:03] <marestad> Publishing a post on text inputs tonight or tomorrow.
[11:26:05] <sfrisk> box shadowssssss
[11:27:03] <sfrisk> I keep meaning to do a post on this: http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/pvgLaL
[11:27:09] <sfrisk> but I want to get the planets to be svgs still
[11:27:15] <sfrisk> and have the sun glow a bit
[11:27:38] <marestad> Whoa. Rad.
[11:30:41] <sfrisk> I couldn't sleep one night and was bored
[11:30:54] <marestad> That sums up every single Pen.
[11:31:25] <sfrisk> haha true
[11:31:40] <sfrisk> right now I'm working on one for teaching myself Phaser.js to make minesweeper
[11:32:05] <marestad> Cool.
[11:32:49] <sfrisk> miss playing with canvas, used to do it all the time like 4 years ago?
[11:35:03] <marestad> I have yet to venture into canvas.
[11:35:26] <marestad> I've been focusing on learning a bunch of rando JS things and daydreaming about `:empty` working on inputs like this: http://codepen.io/MichaelArestad/pen/raqqZy
[11:41:53] <sfrisk> that is cool
