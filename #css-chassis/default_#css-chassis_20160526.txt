[13:03:39] <sfrisk> arschmitz!
[13:03:42] <sfrisk> question!
[13:21:57] <arschmitz> hey
[13:23:26] <arschmitz> @sfrisk whats up?
[13:24:28] <sfrisk> @nashvail is working on some of his work for gsoc
[13:24:49] <sfrisk> and wasn't sure if JSASS had a way of picking a specific color when grabbing variables
[13:25:02] <sfrisk> inside a map of colors
[13:25:25] <arschmitz> im not sure what you mean
[13:25:32] <arschmitz> jsass converts objects to maps
[13:25:39] <arschmitz> to get it from a map is just normal sass
[13:25:49] <nashvail> So something like this is not possible  "colors.info.value.base" in jsass?
[13:25:50] <sfrisk> so for notifications, he just wanted to grab the base color of the primary, for example
[13:25:57] <arschmitz> oh
[13:26:03] <arschmitz> no we limited nesting
[13:26:11] <arschmitz> we discussed that in a meeting
[13:26:17] <arschmitz> and decided it should not be allowed
[13:26:31] <arschmitz> also thats a single value isnt it not an object
[13:26:39] <arschmitz> so it does not need to be de refrenced
[13:26:42] <arschmitz> so it would just be
[13:28:15] <arschmitz> chassis.colors.info.value.base
[13:28:18] <arschmitz> normal ol js
[13:29:11] <arschmitz> derefrencing is only for when your refrencing an object and want it to output a map in the scss and a js refrence in the js output
[13:29:38] <sfrisk> so doing: "background": chassis.colors.default.value.base
[13:30:09] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:30:31] <nashvail> without the () => ?
[13:30:36] <arschmitz> correct
[13:30:38] <sfrisk> yeah
[13:30:43] <arschmitz> that the derefrence syntax
[13:30:51] <arschmitz> thats only for objects
[13:31:06] <nashvail> but that just outputs the string "chassis.colors.default.value.base" in the scss file
[13:31:09] <arschmitz> chassis.colors.default.value.base is a string
[13:31:11] <sfrisk> although I think you want to use the 'base' color for all the notifications, except the 'default' one
[13:31:19] <arschmitz> no
[13:31:19] <sfrisk> correct, nashvail?
[13:31:33] <nashvail> yeah it's different just for the default one
[13:31:45] <sfrisk> maybe reference the map for each one
[13:31:51] <sfrisk> and just create a new map for a dark default?
[13:32:16] <sfrisk> if you're not using the light colors - although I do think the default tones should match what we see in buttons
[13:32:25] <arschmitz> nashvail: doing "background": chassis.colors.default.value.base will output #3F51B5
[13:32:40] <nashvail> oh just a sec
[13:32:44] <nashvail> no quotes right?
[13:32:48] <arschmitz> right
[13:32:50] <nashvail> my bad
[13:32:53] <arschmitz> these are js files
[13:33:04] <arschmitz> so if you want a refrence it needs to be a normal js refrence
[13:33:28] <nashvail> got it, that worked!
[13:34:49] <arschmitz> nashvail: https://github.com/arschmitz/jsass-vars
[13:34:52] <arschmitz> the docs are there
[13:35:38] <nashvail> great!
[13:35:54] <nashvail> thanks arschmitz
[13:36:05] <nashvail> issue solved I can move forward with the work
[13:36:14] <arschmitz> cool
[13:37:06] <sfrisk> I still thinking making a darker color map might be a good idea
[13:37:16] <sfrisk> and then pass in color maps for everything, and grab the base color
[13:38:12] <nashvail> you mean like a new grey : {} in the colors.js
[13:38:32] <nashvail> and then grab from there?
[13:38:58] <sfrisk> or default-dark maybe? if you're opting to do inverse color options that you have in default
[13:39:05] <sfrisk> because right now default buttons have the light bg
[13:39:14] <sfrisk> and your default notifications have the dark grey option
[13:39:20] <sfrisk> dark grey background*
[13:39:50] <nashvail> hmmm you know what we can actually choose one from the pallette for the default if geekman-rohit agrees
[13:40:28] <nashvail> he suggested we go with #333 for default
[13:40:40] <sfrisk> that would change the buttons from white to black
[13:40:46] <sfrisk> or dark grey
[13:42:34] <nashvail> btw I am also working on new buttons style the one I proposed on a new branch I should be able to create a PR for that by tomorrow
[13:46:21] <sfrisk> um
[13:46:33] <sfrisk> we hadn't really gotten any feedback on the buttons yet nashvail
[13:46:46] <sfrisk> and I don't think we should continue to cycle around them when there is a lot of other stuff to work on
[13:46:57] <nashvail> yeah none actually
[13:47:19] <nashvail> alright also Modals are next
[13:47:29] <sfrisk> how comes designs for form elements
[13:47:47] <sfrisk> I know you've come up with some designs for it
[13:48:01] <nashvail> they're all in the .sketch I shared with you
[13:48:07] <sfrisk> okay,
[13:48:19] <sfrisk> I'll get working on applying those to the other form elements then
[13:48:39] <nashvail> but first shouldn't we decide on the default notification bg I can quickly update the PR once that is done
[13:49:13] <geekman-rohit> grey
[13:49:23] <geekman-rohit> and access it with what arshmitz just said
[13:49:27] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz**
[13:49:38] <sfrisk> the one issue with accessing it that way, just as an fyi
[13:50:16] <sfrisk> is if anyone ever alters the scss variables file (if for whatever reason they decided to work with just scss from the compiled version)
[13:50:36] <sfrisk> is that changing the base color in the scss will not change the color in the notification styling
[13:50:38] <sfrisk> just as an fyi
[13:52:28] <geekman-rohit> yes agreed
[13:52:51] <geekman-rohit> so a good old "map-get()" in string is also an option
[13:53:00] <geekman-rohit> providing more visibility to the future users
[13:53:11] <sfrisk> true, but it was something we were trying to avoid having in the js code
[13:53:21] <sfrisk> which is why it might be good to have a light default color scheme
[13:53:25] <sfrisk> and a dark default color scheme
[13:53:42] <sfrisk> Just an idea
[13:53:45] <geekman-rohit> I just want all colors to come from one place
[13:53:52] <sfrisk> I agree
[13:54:04] <geekman-rohit> as long as that is achieved Im happy
[13:54:21] <geekman-rohit> and ya @nashvail your background variable cannot represent a whole color map
[13:54:44] <geekman-rohit> very inconvenient  to modify color
[13:54:52] <geekman-rohit> in the end the variable should hold a color
[13:55:00] <nashvail> in the mixin you mean?
[13:55:06] <geekman-rohit> in the variables
[13:55:38] <geekman-rohit> your background variable is set to the color palette map
[13:55:39] <nashvail> it's being accessed like this now "background": chassis.colors.success.value.base
[13:55:41] <geekman-rohit> the entire map
[13:55:46] <geekman-rohit> that is better
[13:56:04] <geekman-rohit> you can keep that for now, we will discuss if there is a better approach in meeting
[13:56:13] <nashvail> üëç
[13:56:23] <geekman-rohit> coz that hardcodes the color too in the end in scss
[13:56:49] <nashvail> yes it does
[13:59:30] <nashvail> I am going to put "Shades of grey" for the name key
[17:05:20] <arschmitz> Im confused why are notification colors being done any different then button colors de refrence the object then have a mixin that does a map get on it to assign ?
