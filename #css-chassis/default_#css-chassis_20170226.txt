[11:02:58] <sfrisk> Okay we have kristjy here
[11:03:00] <sfrisk> we have me here
[11:03:06] <sfrisk> trying to figure out where geekman-rohit is
[11:03:10] <geekman-rohit> here
[11:03:10] <sfrisk> speak of the devil
[11:03:30] <geekman-rohit> so we are meeting here or at jquery-meeting
[11:03:30] <kristyjy> hello
[11:03:48] <sfrisk> I figured it would be in here, just because we didn't have a formal meeting on the books for #jquery-meeting
[11:04:12] <geekman-rohit> okay
[11:04:18] <geekman-rohit> and that channel log is not working
[11:04:25] <geekman-rohit> its good if this meeting is logged
[11:04:52] <sfrisk> I don't believe this channel is logged
[11:05:02] <sfrisk> I can pull up a google doc though that we can write notes in
[11:05:11] <sfrisk> and we'll post the meeting notes in "where do we go from here"
[11:05:35] <geekman-rohit> oh
[11:05:40] <geekman-rohit> okay
[11:06:11] <geekman-rohit> so its just 3 of us?
[11:06:44] <sfrisk> https://docs.google.com/document/d/149nl7dYqXUwj0bWgYUHZwyS7fP_aVhVwQb35Unz2cWs/edit?usp=sharing
[11:06:55] <sfrisk> I think so, I didn't see anyone else when I checked the dodole yesterday
[11:06:59] <sfrisk> doodle*
[11:07:10] <geekman-rohit> yep
[11:07:15] <geekman-rohit> just 3 responses
[11:07:17] <sfrisk> There is a chance arschmitz might be around, or he could just be logged in but not around
[11:07:31] <geekman-rohit> okay
[11:08:26] <sfrisk> Okay, I think first up we should figure out exactly what our goals are with Chassis, what do we want in a 1.0 release
[11:08:49] <sfrisk> and is there anything we should probably revisit
[11:09:06] <sfrisk> about how we do things
[11:09:22] <geekman-rohit> yeah
[11:09:38] <geekman-rohit> so which one first
[11:10:04] <geekman-rohit> I think a base quickly developed css framework would be nice
[11:10:17] <geekman-rohit> following all standards but very light
[11:10:32] <geekman-rohit> typography/forms
[11:10:35] <kristyjy> like just the basics.. inputs, buttons, tables, grid typography
[11:10:36] <geekman-rohit> with or without grid
[11:11:13] <geekman-rohit> yep but fast development
[11:11:14] <sfrisk> I almost think first pass shouldn't include a grid
[11:11:22] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk i agree
[11:11:24] <kristyjy> yeah actually that's a good point
[11:11:29] <geekman-rohit> grid is also changing quickly
[11:11:30] <kristyjy> we don't need grid
[11:11:48] <geekman-rohit> before soon  css flex and grids will become a standard
[11:12:00] <sfrisk> yeah
[11:12:03] <geekman-rohit> so its better to wait some time, atleast until rest is done
[11:12:09] <sfrisk> I think 1.0 - no Grid
[11:12:14] <geekman-rohit> I agree
[11:13:27] <sfrisk> Typography, inputs, buttons, tables, some basic helper classes maybe?
[11:13:44] <kristyjy> works for me
[11:13:46] <geekman-rohit> helper classes?
[11:14:12] <sfrisk> stuff that might be used in a lot of locations - text align left/right/etc
[11:14:20] <geekman-rohit> cool
[11:14:31] <sfrisk> This is what bootstrap did: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#helper-classes
[11:15:02] <geekman-rohit> i vote we take those last
[11:15:28] <sfrisk> yeah
[11:15:39] <geekman-rohit> typography.. tables... buttons ...we already have some code in, a refactoring should do
[11:15:58] <sfrisk> I think having a design plan might be nice
[11:16:23] <kristyjy> I agree I think we should take the time to do a design style guide before coding again
[11:16:41] <sfrisk> I know that nashvail started some stuff - but I don't know where those files are
[11:16:56] <geekman-rohit> 1. A color Palette 2. flat/ rounded/ material 3. EM/pixels (for margins/size/etc.)
[11:17:17] <sfrisk> Do we want to build this off of material specs?
[11:17:39] <geekman-rohit> nope, just bringing it up
[11:17:45] <sfrisk> we do have some frameworks out there already built against material specs- and after a certain point, you do need JS for some of those interactions
[11:17:55] <geekman-rohit> yeah
[11:18:08] <geekman-rohit> material is also css3 heavy/js heavy
[11:18:24] <kristyjy> agreed I think we should take a very minimalist approach
[11:18:29] <geekman-rohit> yep
[11:18:41] <sfrisk> so are we looking for Chassis to be a starting point for people to build a design off of
[11:18:49] <sfrisk> but handles a lot of the base features and layouts
[11:18:58] <geekman-rohit> I also vote we base button/input/ etc. sizes on ems, so all we need to do to increase size .. is increase font size
[11:19:04] <sfrisk> yeah
[11:19:22] <kristyjy> sounds good to me
[11:19:23] <geekman-rohit> I have some code somewhere.. a moment
[11:19:48] <geekman-rohit> darn, its in a virtual machine
[11:20:52] <sfrisk> so I know we're going with SASS right now - a trend I've  been seeing in the React framework world at least is POST-CSS and the use of CSS Modules
[11:21:30] <geekman-rohit> I am not very familiar with them
[11:21:42] <sfrisk> POST-CSS would let us use CSS vars
[11:21:42] <kristyjy> In that case we wouldn't be able to use JSASS anymore? Is that what we want?
[11:21:46] <geekman-rohit> so I don't have an opinion here
[11:21:58] <geekman-rohit> jsass or not is another question though
[11:22:00] <sfrisk> I guess it's more of a question do we want to use JSASS
[11:22:09] <sfrisk> css vars are accessible via JS
[11:22:16] <kristyjy> because I'm all for getting rid of jsass especially for a quick 1.0 release
[11:22:21] <kristyjy> but that's just me lol
[11:22:24] <geekman-rohit> thats why I had hoped alex would be here
[11:22:26] <geekman-rohit> me too
[11:22:44] <sfrisk> well most of the reason we have jsass was for use in a theme editor
[11:22:49] <geekman-rohit> it is useful, but it does somehow break the usual dev process we are comfortable with for sass
[11:22:50] <sfrisk> to make things a bit easier there
[11:23:48] <kristyjy> theme editor would come later.. but at the same time we don't want to have to change the tech we are using so quickly
[11:23:56] <geekman-rohit> well, I think our one and only priority should be getting to 1.0 soon
[11:24:22] <kristyjy> agreed.. do we know how important the theme editor is to our goals?
[11:24:43] <sfrisk> Well as it is now, I don't think jQuery Mobile or jQuery UI are compatible with css modules
[11:24:43] <geekman-rohit> its also only important if jquery-ui and mobile use chassis
[11:25:32] <geekman-rohit> um
[11:25:35] <kristyjy> if jquery-ui and mobile are our main goals we should probably stick with scss.. otherwise I think post css is the way to go
[11:25:57] <sfrisk> Honestly it might be good if we start going to the jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile meetings
[11:25:57] <kristyjy> if we want react applications to adopt us post-css would be great
[11:26:11] <sfrisk> I tend to be bad about it, but if we want collaboration to happen there, showing up would be good
[11:26:21] <sfrisk> @kristy, right now all of their css is just plain css
[11:26:22] <sfrisk> no scss
[11:26:31] <kristyjy> ah interesting
[11:27:20] <sfrisk> jQuery UI tends to meet at noon ET on Wednesdays
[11:27:26] <sfrisk> jQuery Mobile is 2pm on Thursdays
[11:27:27] <kristyjy> so they don't currently have a theme builder I imagine.. so maybe we should put that goal on the back burner
[11:27:47] <sfrisk> they have a theme builder
[11:27:50] <geekman-rohit> they each have a theme builder
[11:27:59] <kristyjy> lol darn it
[11:28:07] <sfrisk> https://jqueryui.com/themeroller/
[11:28:09] <geekman-rohit> thats why we will need a chassis theme builder if they use chassis
[11:28:12] <sfrisk> https://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/
[11:28:38] <sfrisk> let me check CSS Vars support
[11:28:46] <geekman-rohit> im okay with post css, seems interesting..
[11:28:47] <kristyjy> yeah okay then.. I think we stick with scss/jsass then.. we don't want to shoot ourselves in the foot later
[11:29:05] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, im afraid this is your decision to take :P
[11:29:11] <sfrisk> @kristy - neither of the projects use scss/jsass
[11:29:21] <sfrisk> we would still have to figure out how to integrate them
[11:29:35] <sfrisk> I'm looking at CSS vars because those are accessible via JS
[11:29:47] <kristyjy> ooo okay
[11:29:54] <sfrisk> I think support for IE is supposed to come out this year
[11:29:59] <sfrisk> for css vars
[11:30:12] <sfrisk> and those could be useful in helping to make themes
[11:30:28] <sfrisk> http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables
[11:30:44] <sfrisk> Alas, not supported in IE 11, it's in development for edge, no opera mini
[11:31:01] <geekman-rohit> opera mini is a pain in the a**
[11:31:02] <geekman-rohit> :/
[11:31:07] <geekman-rohit> they dont support anything
[11:31:08] <sfrisk> However, POST CSS is setup to automatically convert css vars to regular attributes
[11:31:27] <geekman-rohit> so what are pros and cons of post css over sass?
[11:32:07] <sfrisk> I remember back in early discussions for this project, we wanted are CSS to be as future CSS as possible - unfortunately some of the stuff we wanted to do wasn't fully supported by CSS at the time
[11:32:28] <sfrisk> and POST-CSS hadn't really caught on yet
[11:32:34] <sfrisk> thus we decided on SCSS
[11:32:49] <sfrisk> the only problem with it, we acknowledged, was at some point we might want to convert to css
[11:32:59] <sfrisk> that being said, BEM is a bit easier with SCSS
[11:33:24] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk the whole point of BEM was having once class for one thing
[11:33:27] <geekman-rohit> only one class
[11:33:42] <sfrisk> except that's not what we have
[11:33:43] <geekman-rohit> without it, BEM has become not much of a technique but a naming convention
[11:33:46] <sfrisk> we still have multiple classes
[11:33:47] <geekman-rohit> yep
[11:33:54] <sfrisk> basically a major advantage for SCSS is the mixins
[11:34:14] <geekman-rohit> we can technically live without mixins
[11:34:26] <sfrisk> you just have to make sure you type the same stuff for each class
[11:34:39] <geekman-rohit> what about @extend?
[11:34:49] <kristyjy> no @extend either
[11:35:17] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk which frameworks are using postcss?
[11:35:33] <sfrisk> I've seen a lot of react frameworks and starter kits heading in that directions
[11:35:44] <geekman-rohit> if its the future .. we should go with it
[11:35:49] <sfrisk> with the CSS for a module paired in the same folder as the code for that module
[11:35:53] <geekman-rohit> it will make us different from others
[11:36:25] <sfrisk> to be fair, you can use both together: https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/using-postcss-together-with-sass-stylus-or-less--cms-24591
[11:36:35] <geekman-rohit> existing frameworks have to carry a lot of baggage
[11:36:49] <geekman-rohit> since we are new, we have a choice here
[11:36:57] <kristyjy> agreed I do think it's the future... I go back and forth if I like that or not though lol
[11:37:11] <sfrisk> we can use sass for the mixins we like
[11:37:18] <sfrisk> and postcss can help us with other stuff
[11:37:35] <kristyjy> hmm you sure that's not overkill?
[11:38:22] <sfrisk> https://benfrain.com/breaking-up-with-sass-postcss/
[11:38:30] <sfrisk> Might be worht researching a bit
[11:38:54] <geekman-rohit> we are looking for quick development
[11:38:58] <geekman-rohit> i think we should stick to one
[11:39:20] <kristyjy> but knowing we can use both we could always readd scss after the fact
[11:39:23] <geekman-rohit> we can call a vote, but theres not many people :/
[11:40:42] <kristyjy> after going back and forth I'm ready to say post css makes sense for version 1.0. But clearly I'm torn on the issue and could go either way lol
[11:41:28] <sfrisk> I mean, with SASS we do get access to SASS vars, mixins, @if, and basically the "code-like" features of SASS
[11:41:42] <geekman-rohit> ill vote sass , coz im comfortable with it, post css would mean getting used to new things, which means.. more time investment
[11:41:50] <sfrisk> POST-CSS will look more like future css (since you can argue in many ways POST-CSS is like babel for css)
[11:42:20] <sfrisk> POST-CSS is just following css standards
[11:43:33] <kristyjy> yeah I like the comparison of babel for CSS. Very true
[11:43:54] <sfrisk> However, flipside
[11:44:08] <sfrisk> SASS makes the BEM architecture a lot easier
[11:44:38] <kristyjy> very true.. having mixins and @if is super nice for this kind of work
[11:44:40] <sfrisk> if we can't ensure someone won't use CSS Modules, the BEM/Atomic architecture makes sense
[11:44:55] <kristyjy> like I said I'm pretty 50/50 on this. I think as lead it's up to you Sarah
[11:45:19] <sfrisk> I kinda really wish arschmitz or scott_gonzalez were in on this conversation
[11:45:30] <scott_gonzalez> who me?
[11:45:35] <kristyjy> HI!
[11:45:35] <sfrisk> yes you!
[11:45:37] <sfrisk> hey!
[11:45:41] <scott_gonzalez> How far up should I read?
[11:46:10] <sfrisk> TLDR: Looking at what we want to do with Chassis from here. Not much has happened in project in last 2 years, but lots has happened in web world
[11:46:42] <sfrisk> since Chassis potentially is to be used by jQuery Mobile / jQuery UI, we're wondering if we're better off sticking with SASS and a BEM / Atomic structure
[11:47:00] <sfrisk> or if POST-CSS and building this to be CSS Modules compatible is a better direction
[11:47:26] <sfrisk> Also we're saying we should be better at showing up to the jQuery Mobile and jQuery UI meetings
[11:47:29] <sfrisk> but work days are hard
[11:47:30] <scott_gonzalez> I always prefer embracing upcoming standarsd, so long as they seem beneficial.
[11:48:08] <scott_gonzalez> Most of our meeting discussions for UI don't really touch on theming, so I wouldn't worry about that.
[11:48:10] <sfrisk> I've done a lot with CSS modules and POST-CSS at work lately, and I like it a lot
[11:48:16] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure about the JQuery Mobile meetings.
[11:48:36] <sfrisk> POST-CSS would make it eventually easier to utilize CSS variables in themeing
[11:48:52] <sfrisk> (come on Microsoft, work harder at developing features)
[11:49:00] <geekman-rohit> @sfrisk it would also mean, redoing the basic setup for chassis
[11:49:07] <geekman-rohit> right from the tools
[11:49:20] <geekman-rohit> it would basically mean a full reset
[11:49:41] <sfrisk> I'm aware of that
[11:49:57] <geekman-rohit> umm its a tough choice!
[11:50:00] <sfrisk> I'm also not convinced that would be a bad thing
[11:50:23] <kristyjy> I agree with you @sfrisk I think we need a clean slate in a way
[11:50:24] <sfrisk> Setting up POST-CSS, testing, linting, etc actually wouldn't take all that long
[11:50:37] <geekman-rohit> I'm okay with whatever you decide, since ill be there from day one now
[11:50:45] <scott_gonzalez> Recognizing it early and making the changes sooner will be a lot less costly than waiting a few years and realizing you have no other choice.
[11:50:56] <geekman-rohit> I wasnt there when grunt was setup and wasnt involved when alex made jsass etc.
[11:51:47] <sfrisk> It's just the more I've looked at frameworks, especially what other JS frameworks are using - I'm seeing a push for CSS modules
[11:51:58] <sfrisk> and also POST-CSS is becoming more and more popular
[11:52:16] <scott_gonzalez> Seems like you already know what to do :-)
[11:52:31] <sfrisk> Okay then
[11:52:37] <kristyjy> lol you'd think.. but we've been back and forth many times so far
[11:52:53] <sfrisk> I like playing Devil's Advocate against myself, okay
[11:53:01] <scott_gonzalez> That's a good thing.
[11:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> Hasty decisions generally aren't a good thing.
[11:53:25] <kristyjy> lol no it's an important choice.. and I keep flip flopping about it
[11:53:59] <kristyjy> because there are very strong arguments for both
[11:54:24] <geekman-rohit> I wish we had arshmitz's opinion
[11:54:31] <sfrisk> I've also had the opportunity lately to play with different tech at work lately, which has me leaning more towards "CSS Modules and POST CSS are the future of working with CSS frameworks and JS frameworks"
[11:54:47] <kristyjy> yeah I feel like he might be mad at us for just ditching all of the jsass stuff
[11:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz is a reasonable and pragmatic person.
[11:55:56] <kristyjy> :)
[11:56:14] <scott_gonzalez> I'm sure he will prefer a better future for the project over using the tools he built.
[11:56:52] <scott_gonzalez> After all, we build a lot of tools with the expectation that they will eventually become unnecessary.
[11:57:30] <kristyjy> this is true
[11:58:08] <kristyjy> I'm ready to say that the future tech is more important than the nice to haves of scss at this point. You guys with me?
[11:58:21] <sfrisk> Well, if we're concerned on the jQuery mobile standpoint, we could show up to the jQuery Mobile meeting on Thursday and bring up our plans for Chassis there
[11:58:22] <sfrisk> get input
[11:58:33] <kristyjy> actually that's a good idea
[11:59:34] <kristyjy> I think we should write down a small list of goals for the project. This way everyone is on the same page about what should be a priority in the future
[12:00:49] <geekman-rohit> also this log works fine http://irc.jquery.org/%23css-chassis/default_%23css-chassis_20170226.log.html
[12:00:52] <geekman-rohit> thats good
[12:01:05] <kristyjy> woot
[12:02:41] <geekman-rohit> the log is working fine for this channel is what I meant*
[12:02:56] <sfrisk> Oh nice
[12:03:15] <geekman-rohit> its only jquery-meeting that seems to have problem
[12:03:25] <sfrisk> Now that I'm thinking about it, we're actually probably fine with not having mixins, by using css vars
[12:04:35] <geekman-rohit> im not a big fan of mixins
[12:04:48] <sfrisk> I can come up with a codepen example
[12:04:58] <kristyjy> awesome :)
[12:05:32] <sfrisk> might still need two classes though . . .
[12:05:48] <kristyjy> So do we go to the other meetings this week and then finalize our choice for POST-CSS?
[12:06:10] <sfrisk> I think so - it gives everyone a chance to play with it a litle
[12:06:23] <sfrisk> (PostCSS is an option on codepen, fyi)
[12:06:31] <geekman-rohit> cool
[12:06:39] <geekman-rohit> ill play with it
[12:10:05] <sfrisk> if we like it, I'll make a branch using it
[12:10:55] <sfrisk> @scott_gonzalez, on a whole are we still pretty pro grunt, or is gulp an okay option for builds? I know we originally went with grunt because we were using it everywhere else
[12:12:03] <scott_gonzalez> You're fine to use whatever build system or task runner you want :-)
[12:13:38] <sfrisk> okay
[12:14:48] <geekman-rohit> I like grunt over gulp though
[12:15:11] <geekman-rohit> I find it easier to setup and use
[12:17:27] <sfrisk> everyone, you have access to edit the google doc (or if you don't , let me know
[12:17:40] <sfrisk> feel free to fill out your thoughts, add to pro/cons
[12:17:45] <sfrisk> we'll review on tuesdsays meeting
[12:21:46] <geekman-rohit> Ill be going if we are done? I have a bad headache
[12:21:52] <sfrisk> I think so
[12:22:16] <kristyjy> cool have a good day everyone
[12:22:18] <geekman-rohit> see you all on tuesday,! this was a good idea!
[12:22:31] <sfrisk> yeah!
[12:22:34] <kristyjy> :)
[12:22:42] <sfrisk> having even a monthly checkin or something like this as needed might be nice
