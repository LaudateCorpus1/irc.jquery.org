[08:35:18] <sfrisk> Morning everyone
[09:02:23] <arthurvr> hey sfrisk
[09:02:29] <arthurvr> 6pm here :p
[09:02:37] <sfrisk> just hit noon here
[09:03:51] <geekman-rohit> 9:30 pm here
[09:03:53] <geekman-rohit> :D
[09:04:10] <sfrisk> the joys of working on a project together over a bunch of time zones!
[09:04:56] <geekman-rohit> arthurvr sfrisk made some really awesome design for the themeroller
[09:05:07] <geekman-rohit> did you by chance see them?
[09:05:12] <sfrisk> still tweaking them though
[09:05:20] <sfrisk> hoping to get some time on the long weekend
[09:05:25] <arthurvr> link?
[09:05:43] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: sfrisk: im curious the prview portion
[09:05:53] <geekman-rohit> a moment
[09:05:58] <geekman-rohit> preview?
[09:06:00] <arschmitz> were you planning on it being a single page that shows everything at once like ui / mobile
[09:06:12] <arschmitz> or will it change based on what your currently editing
[09:06:24] <sfrisk> I figured it would change on what you were currently editing
[09:06:35] <geekman-rohit> http://www.sarahfrisk.com/chassis/themeroller.jpg
[09:06:43] <sfrisk> separated out into relevant sectons
[09:06:55] <arschmitz> ok
[09:06:59] <sfrisk> http://www.sarahfrisk.com/chassis/themerollerb.jpg
[09:07:08] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk but the ui then will have to cache all the pages from the chassis demo
[09:07:18] <geekman-rohit> for a seamless navigation
[09:07:24] <sfrisk> true, you could put everything in there
[09:07:31] <sfrisk> on the righthand side
[09:07:37] <arschmitz> i actually like the idea of having it change
[09:07:38] <geekman-rohit> and make our own tabs
[09:07:44] <sfrisk> annd switching around in the nav just skips down to the appropriate area
[09:07:49] <arschmitz> based on what your editing
[09:08:18] <arschmitz> i think that will get clunky
[09:08:52] <geekman-rohit> so based on what tab is open in the sidebar
[09:08:58] <sfrisk> yeah
[09:08:59] <geekman-rohit> we open the related tab in the preview
[09:09:10] <geekman-rohit> and based on what accordian is open
[09:09:18] <geekman-rohit> we scroll the preview page
[09:09:47] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: no i would never force scroll
[09:10:00] <geekman-rohit> yep, arschmitz I agree
[09:10:04] <arschmitz> thats very disruptive to the user
[09:10:24] <geekman-rohit> even auto open tabs. .we could give him a button to allow or disallow that
[09:10:30] <arschmitz> just show the page what ever your editing
[09:10:50] <arschmitz> personally i wouldnt even do user navigable tabs
[09:10:58] <arschmitz> it should just show the demo for whatever your editing
[09:11:03] <sfrisk> to go to the different sections?
[09:11:10] <arschmitz> yes
[09:11:18] <arschmitz> the editing tab you have open IS the nav
[09:11:37] <arschmitz> having two different ways to do it will just be confusing
[09:11:44] <arschmitz> and lead to possible state inconsistencies
[09:11:50] <geekman-rohit> agreed
[09:12:04] <geekman-rohit> so if someone clicks on typography tab
[09:12:09] <sfrisk> so do it like in the design? That you can only edit variables for the area you're in
[09:12:14] <geekman-rohit> we open the typography demo page
[09:12:17] <arschmitz> why would you ever want the tabs editor open when your working on a button
[09:12:25] <arschmitz> sfrisk: yes
[09:12:46] <geekman-rohit> but there should be a summary too then
[09:13:09] <geekman-rohit> somewhere where user can see a preview of all.. to see if it all looks good as a theme
[09:13:16] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: we plan on having a like "kitchen sink" demo
[09:13:22] <arschmitz> thats kinda a big over view of the lib
[09:13:31] <arschmitz> you could just that as a "preview"
[09:13:42] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[09:13:52] <arschmitz> sfrisk: you had a better name then kitchen sink but i cant remember lol
[09:14:00] <sfrisk> pattern library?
[09:14:32] <geekman-rohit> we could have a toggle button
[09:14:47] <geekman-rohit> if set user will see demo based on what he is editing
[09:14:59] <geekman-rohit> if unset he sees the one large summary page in preview
[09:15:18] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: yeah im down with that
[09:15:34] <sfrisk> that works
[09:15:40] <sfrisk> I'll make a note to add that to the design
[09:16:04] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz there was the question of variables.. would it say be too much load if ui creates input fields dynamically
[09:16:39] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: no but why?
[09:16:50] <arschmitz> what advantage is there to generating them on the fly?
[09:17:12] <geekman-rohit> we could have a json file that specifies all variables and compression / decompression functions
[09:17:20] <geekman-rohit> both ui and api use the same file
[09:17:37] <geekman-rohit> any change in variables/ adding more variables in future we will just add it to the file
[09:17:41] <arschmitz> you could do that on the back end
[09:17:59] <arschmitz> and there will already be such a file in chassis
[09:18:03] <geekman-rohit> that could work too yeah
[09:19:33] <sfrisk> sounds good
[09:19:51] <geekman-rohit> but then our ui and api will not be very independent ? just a thought
[09:20:02] <geekman-rohit> we plan to use the same ui as a firefox extension
[09:21:06] <arschmitz> yeah if we use node
[09:21:13] <arschmitz> we can share all the content generation functions
[09:21:43] <geekman-rohit> we could support both at the api, get the content generation function or get the content itself
[09:22:22] <geekman-rohit> i guess theres some time for that, :)
[09:22:26] <arschmitz> im pretty open to how you want to make this work
[09:22:32] <geekman-rohit> thanks :)
[09:22:34] <arschmitz> as long as its performant
[09:22:38] <sfrisk> what Alex said
[09:23:42] <geekman-rohit> :) cool
[09:24:39] <arschmitz> my other concern in general is that other team members can easily maintain and upgrade it
[09:24:48] <arschmitz> if your no longer around
[09:24:57] <sfrisk> that's a pretty important thing with any jquery project though
[09:25:03] <arschmitz> yes
[09:25:12] <sfrisk> we want to be able to have community involvement
[09:25:38] <geekman-rohit> agreed
[09:25:57] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz travis.yml file can have tabs for indentation?
[09:26:03] <geekman-rohit> its failing if I use tabs
[09:32:47] <arschmitz> no
[09:33:03] <arschmitz> yml is whitespace dependent
[09:35:26] <sfrisk> Okay, I require foods
[09:35:30] <sfrisk> need anything else from me?
[09:38:39] <geekman-rohit> sorry I was check arthurvr's comments
[09:41:31] <arthurvr> geekman-rohit: arschmitz: in other projects our travis configs use 2 spaces indentation here it was 4
[09:41:36] <arthurvr> that’s where I was complaining about
[09:41:41] <arthurvr> sorry for the confusion.
[09:42:04] <arschmitz> arthurvr: as far as i know its not an option
[09:42:11] <arschmitz> yml is completely whitespace dependant
[09:42:17] <arschmitz> it must be 2 spaces
[09:42:26] <arthurvr> yes now it’s 4
[09:42:40] <arschmitz> arthurvr: i have not looked at the PR or your comments yet
[09:42:41] <geekman-rohit> it passed the validation though
[09:42:57] <arschmitz> i was just answering geekman-rohit question
[09:43:04] <arthurvr> I think 4 works but is against the ”official” style guide thing they have
[09:43:17] <geekman-rohit> Ill make it 2 :)
[09:43:18] <arthurvr> anyways no need to discuss it
[09:43:20] <arthurvr> thx
