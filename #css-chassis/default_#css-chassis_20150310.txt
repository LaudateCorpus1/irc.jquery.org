[00:44:57] <Samat> Hi! Is there someone awake? It is just 10:43 here in Moscow. I just wanted to ask: so today's meeting will be at #jquery-meeting rather than here?
[00:45:20] <Samat> Hi! Is there someone awake? It is just 10:43AM here in Moscow. I just wanted to ask: so today's meeting will be at #jquery-meeting rather than here?
[00:46:32] <Samat> Oops. Just saw the answer in the heading og the channel. Sorry for bothering:) Thanks
[01:13:28] <prasunanand> Samat: the meeting will be at #jquery-meeting at 1pm EST
[01:14:11] <Samat> Got it. Thank you
[08:20:18] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] geekman-rohit opened pull request #51: Performance: Add Dojo Widget to test suite (master...performance_d) http://git.io/pROs
[08:21:55] <geekman-rohit> PR sent to add Dojo-dijit to the tests
[08:30:14] <prasunanand> arschmitz: I commented on my PR . Please take a look.
[08:31:17] <sfrisk> prasunanand: we're going to discuss it at the meeting today
[08:31:33] <prasunanand> Ok.
[08:32:08] <sfrisk> and arschmitz and I get an email every time you submit a PR/comment on a PR
[08:32:25] <sfrisk> We see all :-)
[08:33:53] <prasunanand> Oh sorry, I have also made tests for "Kendo-UI" buttons and "Get-UI" buttons. So if I get feedback on current PR, I'll make new PRs.
[08:34:00] <prasunanand> :)
[09:58:36] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] trailofdad opened pull request #52: Sass build (master...sass-build) http://git.io/p0To
[09:59:35] <trailofdad> ugh
[10:00:14] <trailofdad> thanks
[10:00:20] <trailofdad> that was a mistake
[10:00:22] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] arschmitz closed pull request #52: Sass build (master...sass-build) http://git.io/p0To
[10:00:34] <arschmitz> trailofdad: oh cool i figured
[10:01:30] <sfrisk> Meeting time over in #jquery-meeting
[10:18:05] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] sfrisk opened issue #53: Table Styling http://git.io/p0cx
[11:16:49] <sfrisk> So before implementing forms, I definitely think it should get discussed a little further in the issues
[11:17:30] <geekman-rohit> we should see how other do it, what they do good, and especially what  we should avoid
[11:17:52] <samat123> Ok, I will post my ideas in the most recent times there
[11:17:57] <prasunanand> arschmitz: Can you have a look at my PR?
[11:18:28] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, the GSOC proposals start this week
[11:18:38] <geekman-rohit> or next week, but before the next meeting
[11:18:53] <trailofdad> sfrisk I might take on doing some research on best practices for an scss style guide and possibly come up with an outline if you think that is a good idea
[11:19:43] <sfrisk> ah, starts next Monday
[11:20:16] <sfrisk> sounds good trailofdad
[11:20:41] <geekman-rohit> If I need help expanding on idea? or views of chassis team about certain things?
[11:20:58] <sfrisk> ping either myself or arschmitz here
[11:21:03] <sfrisk> or send me an email if I'm not around
[11:21:18] <geekman-rohit> thanks, you seem busy right now! I'l ping laters :)
[11:21:22] <sfrisk> I'll get to them in the evening when I get out of work
[11:21:29] <sfrisk> since I do have a full time job thing I do :-)
[11:21:38] <geekman-rohit> at jQuery foundation?
[11:21:42] <trailofdad> I'm planning on submitting a GSOC proposal sa well. I'm still working on getting the full scope of this project, but I have some ideas I'll run by someone
[11:21:59] <sfrisk> well my email is up on github
[11:22:05] <sfrisk> so you can ping me if you want
[11:22:07] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: the jquery foundation is almost entirely volunteers
[11:22:26] <sfrisk> My full time job isn't for the jQuery Foundation
[11:22:34] <sfrisk> I work at a software development company
[11:22:40] <arschmitz> there are only 4 paid devs across all projects and only 2 of them are part time
[11:22:56] <trailofdad> thats impressive
[11:22:58] <arschmitz> basicly everyone you talk to has a full time job and is just donating their free time
[11:23:03] <geekman-rohit> yep, that is
[11:23:05] <sfrisk> I tend to do a lot of my Chassis work during my lunch break, and then on the evenings
[11:23:08] <sfrisk> around making comics
[11:23:29] <prasunanand> cool
[11:23:39] <trailofdad> I'm a web programming student and have replaced video games with coding over the years :D
[11:23:48] <trailofdad> except company of heroes....
[11:24:30] <sfrisk> you should try participating in Ludum Dare some time, it's lots of fun
[11:24:39] <sfrisk> if you like video games and coding
[11:24:48] <sfrisk> Next one is coming up in April
[11:24:49] <sfrisk> http://ludumdare.com/compo/
[11:24:52] <geekman-rohit> Tavern Wrenches, I been through that! its amazing. I'll ping after some research on codes of the jquerymobilethemeroller
[11:25:19] <sfrisk> Sounds good!
[11:25:36] <trailofdad> ohhh that looks fun
[11:26:15] <sfrisk> I highly recommend it, it's a lot of fun and you learn a lot
[11:26:25] <sfrisk> even if you don't always complete a game (which has been the case for me before in the past)
[11:29:59] <trailofdad> will building themes using Chassis 1.0 on another CMS be viable for the summer?
[11:31:57] <sfrisk> Possibly, but it would probably have to be a starter theme - since a lot of the UI components will be in active development throughout the summer
[11:32:11] <sfrisk> which works since chassis 1.0 is a css framework
[11:32:41] <sfrisk> but stuff like the standards for headers/footers/other ui components might be a bit vague
[11:33:49] <sfrisk> but we could work with you to figure out the best way to implement those type of components to align with the naming conventions we want to use
[11:34:11] <sfrisk> What CMS(s) were you considering?
[11:40:51] <geekman-rohit> Well juts CMs?? I use jekyll, a jekyll template based on chassis sounds awesome to me
[11:42:27] <geekman-rohit> just my views
[11:42:49] <sfrisk> jekyll template would definitely be useful for github page adoption
[11:43:05] <geekman-rohit> just what I thought, especially for developer+bloggers
[11:43:44] <sfrisk> you could have your proposal include having the creation of the theme, and helping add the css components required for the themes?
[11:44:02] <sfrisk> (footers, pagination, etc)
[11:44:49] <geekman-rohit> sorry that was for me or trailofdad?
[11:45:33] <trailofdad> sfrisk I was thinking of starting with wp
[11:46:13] <sfrisk> Both?
[11:46:54] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, I want to apply for the theme-roller, + custom builder? I mean the part where we allow user to customize the build
[11:47:13] <sfrisk> I mean, we need themes created for a bunch of CMS to help with adoption, so if you want to just do that for fun, that's awesome
[11:47:42] <sfrisk> if you want to do it for a proposal, it might involve working with the creations of css-components a bit to create the components you might need for a theme
[11:48:01] <trailofdad> indeed
[11:48:15] <trailofdad> would take some pre-planning to make sure its possible
[11:48:58] <geekman-rohit> sorry,i am getting confused, :P that "if you want to do it for a proposal, .." was about CMS or themeroller
[11:49:30] <trailofdad> I still have the week to think about it some more and what is realistially the best project for the summer
[11:50:54] <sfrisk> oh, I meant for a CMS, sorry geekman-rohit
[11:51:13] <sfrisk> I was unclear
[11:51:17] <geekman-rohit> yep, understood, I went through the convo again :P., my bad
[11:51:39] <geekman-rohit> I'll do the jekyll for fun, I will have to do it for my own blog anyways
[11:52:01] <sfrisk> sounds good :-)
[11:52:42] <trailofdad> sfrisk is there a list of potential proposals that could be made for the summer?
[11:52:53] <trailofdad> Its hard to know what will need to be done at that time :P
[11:53:29] <sfrisk> let me go find the wiki article for it
[11:53:48] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/wiki/Chassis-Roadmap
[11:53:51] <geekman-rohit> I have it open
[11:54:04] <sfrisk> there is a list of proposal ideas too
[11:54:05] <sfrisk> one sec
[11:54:24] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List
[11:56:08] <sfrisk> scroll down and you'll see the suggestion for Chassis proposals
[11:56:46] <trailofdad> hmmm I'm actually thinking that working on the website to add documentation might be the best fit for me
[11:57:03] <sfrisk> only issue on that is we don't have a website right now
[11:57:48] <sfrisk> And I think we ended up learning afterwards writing documentation didn't count
[11:58:08] <trailofdad> yeah, it doesn't
[11:58:08] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, for the theme-roller are we considering swatches too?
[11:58:11] <sfrisk> Plus a lot of the tutorials/documentations would be required for the UI components
[11:58:21] <geekman-rohit> like the themeroller for jquery mobile
[11:59:27] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit: like changing colors in general? or the A, B, C thing?
[11:59:35] <geekman-rohit> A B C thing
[12:00:30] <sfrisk> I'll admit, I like the idea of at least supporting swatches, since it ties into what we're working on for the color variable names
[12:00:41] <sfrisk> not sure if you'll need multiple swatches
[12:00:47] <geekman-rohit> it sounds exciting to work on to me, but what we need would be more important
[12:00:48] <sfrisk> but at least having one swatch would be good
[12:01:16] <sfrisk> I would put more than one swatch as a lower priority, but something fun you can work on if you get that far?
[12:01:33] <geekman-rohit> understood, yes
[12:01:53] <geekman-rohit> i like the idea and it excites me, so i get ambitious, yes
[12:02:09] <trailofdad> the page(s) for the pattern library... there should be componets finished at that time correct?
[12:02:22] <trailofdad> the summer that is
[12:03:09] <sfrisk> it could start with being a page of everything in Phase One, then expanding that as more components are created throughout the summer
[12:03:13] <sfrisk> and helping out with those components
[12:03:28] <trailofdad> that is a fantastic idea
[12:03:38] <trailofdad> thank you!
[12:04:09] <sfrisk> so you would be closely tied with the component creation part of the UI toolkit
[12:05:16] <trailofdad> hmm very cool idea. Sounds like good experience
[12:05:22] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, one last question, drag and drop colors is something to consider or is needed ?
[12:05:37] <geekman-rohit> like drag a color and drop it on a heading etc.
[12:07:08] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit: Consider. Step one could probably just be a color input where you write in the color
[12:07:36] <geekman-rohit> yep, thanks for your time :)
[12:08:10] <sfrisk> No problem!
[12:13:41] <trailofdad> sfrisk have you seen pattern lab? they also use the atomic structure... very interesting
[12:13:50] <trailofdad> http://patternlab.io/
[12:13:57] <sfrisk> very cool
[13:32:12] <prasunanand> sfrisk, For the GSOC proposal , I would like to work for Chassis websites creating  demos, tutorials, and API documentation. I have recently worked with jekyll to create the edu page of BIOJS(opensource javascript library) .It is hosted at edu.biojs.net. I have adequate experience of using jekyll to create the tutorials.
[13:34:32] <sfrisk> I think we found out after we posted that as a potential proposal that writing documentation isn't necessarily something someone is allowed to do for gsoc
[13:34:52] <sfrisk> also we currently don't have a website, and a lot of the documentation would be dependent on the UI components
[13:35:02] <sfrisk> which we'll be starting work on mid summer
[13:35:23] <prasunanand> still creating tutorials as css-chassis 1.0 , it would be helpful in adoption of chassis
[13:35:47] <sfrisk> No much would be required for 1.0 chassis - it's a pretty simplistic CSS framework
[13:36:08] <sfrisk> mostly just "Use this class to make your input have an error state"
[13:36:45] <sfrisk> Most of that documentation could be done in a week - and is not enough for a full summer project
[13:37:21] <prasunanand> So, can I work on the CMS.
[13:38:25] <sfrisk> working on a theme for a CMS, that included helping to create css components (such as navigation and pagination) would be more useful.
[13:43:41] <prasunanand> Also, will Creating a Pattern Library of Chassis components would be good for summer. I like testing. And I can add performance tests for different components other than buttons
[13:45:30] <sfrisk> The suggestion I gave for people looking at pattern library is to include working on the component library
[13:46:00] <sfrisk> since you would start out in the summer adding the phase 1 things, and add the ui toolkit items as they are created, by helping to create them
[13:49:39] <prasunanand> All the proposals initially demand of creating the css components :)
[13:50:08] <sfrisk> well, this is a css heavy project
[13:50:17] <sfrisk> and the majority of chassis will be css components
[13:53:13] <prasunanand> Sure, Got it. I'll look into which "idea to work on" will be suited for me as the project develops
[13:53:55] <sfrisk> :-)
[13:55:11] <prasunanand> Thanks
[13:55:13] <prasunanand> :)
