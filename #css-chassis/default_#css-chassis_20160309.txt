[07:20:45] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] nashvail opened pull request #144: Initial files and initial demo styles added (master...10-form-input-state-styling) https://git.io/vakzC
[12:10:02] <nashvail> I updated the last PR with a commit, could someone check and let me know if that's compatible with the code base
[13:43:29] <sfrisk> nashvail - looks like you're 2 commits behind master
[13:45:15] <sfrisk> and there are some conflicts with master
[13:46:01] <sfrisk> if you merge latest master into your branch - you can look at the stuff in the button code to get an idea for how we do variables
[13:46:13] <sfrisk> since it looks like you just grabbed color variables, that's it
[20:57:35] <nashvail> sfrisk: Sure
