[00:01:58] <MelodyCuida> It'll be really helpful if you can give me some suggestion on how I can do this work.
[04:56:39] <KalmaneCKN> Hello. I want to contribute to the chassis project. i wish to create some UI components for the jQuery mobile interface. Although I know just basic HTML and CSS.Can you help me with my proposal? Thank You.
[10:02:21] <MelodyCuida> anybody here?
[10:04:13] <arthurvr> MelodyCuida: Hey!
[10:09:13] <MelodyCuida> I am interested in the idea 'Chassis - Create a theme for a CMS that implements Chassis'
[10:09:42] <MelodyCuida> but I don't know how I can get started
[10:09:55] <sfrisk> For the proposal writing?
[10:10:19] <MelodyCuida> yeah...I'v sent you an email,sfrisk
[10:11:12] <sfrisk> which email was it?
[10:11:41] <sfrisk> I'm trying to keep on top of my emails, but it's possible I missed it
[10:11:45] <MelodyCuida> sarah@sarahfrisk.com
[10:13:01] <sfrisk> no, I meant what was the title of the email
[10:13:02] <MelodyCuida> I forked your project and read the source code. It seems that you utilize other framework's components like bootstrap and jquery-ui, and I didn't see your own implementation of standards.
[10:13:03] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] arschmitz created typography (+1 new commit): http://git.io/h1Ns
[10:13:03] <chassis-commit> css-chassis/typography 87da451 Michael Arestad: Build: Initial typographic styles
[10:13:29] <MelodyCuida> oh...the title is Seeking help for my proposal for 'Chassis - Create a theme for a CMS that implements Chassis'
[10:13:35] <sfrisk> You were looking at the performance testing side of things
[10:14:09] <sfrisk> ah, okay, I was about to start in on answering that one
[10:14:25] <sfrisk> I slept in today since I've been sick the past few days
[10:14:26] <MelodyCuida> thank you
[10:14:50] <sfrisk> but the different framework components you saw listed were part of performance testing
[10:14:55] <MelodyCuida> Hope you'll be better^_^
[10:15:20] <sfrisk> since we're trying to see how other frameworks did in performance testing and rendering speeds to try and best figure out the best way to write our code
[10:15:37] <sfrisk> also it's there for when we have more CSS to work with, we can test our own code against the performance testing
[10:15:47] <sfrisk> to see where we stand as we develop
[10:16:33] <MelodyCuida> yes, I mean this too. Currently, I can't find your code there..
[10:16:42] <sfrisk> We currently are in phase one of the project: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/wiki/Chassis-Roadmap
[10:16:47] <sfrisk> the creation of a css framework
[10:17:04] <sfrisk> and we're in the middle of working out the details of typography
[10:17:17] <sfrisk> before we get into the other base components common in a css framework
[10:17:34] <sfrisk> the css framework side of things should be in place by the time you start working, however
[10:18:04] <sfrisk> so part of your proposal for a theme would involve implementing what is already there (typography, grid, buttons, etc)
[10:18:19] <sfrisk> and also help creating any UI components that might be required for a CMS
[10:18:27] <sfrisk> (drop down navigation, pagination, etc)
[10:18:44] <sfrisk> and adding those to the chassis framework as you develop
[10:18:51] <MelodyCuida> yeah, so if I want to work out a theme, I have to use other frameworks' components before your css framework comes out?
[10:19:05] <sfrisk> No, I'm saying you create those components
[10:19:11] <sfrisk> and commit them to Chassis
[10:19:21] <MelodyCuida> oh, that would be interesting too!
[10:19:58] <sfrisk> so in your proposal - I would add what sort of components you feel would probably needed to be added to chassis that aren't part of a basic css framework
[10:20:11] <sfrisk> and add time into your timeline for the development of those items
[10:20:53] <MelodyCuida> yes, I will add it to my timeline, thank you
[10:21:15] <sfrisk> And also, if you're doing wordpress, I suggest making your theme a starter theme, to make it easy for other people to tweak it to match their design needs
[10:23:21] <MelodyCuida> yeah. I choose this idean because it's a very challenging job, at the same time, very meaningful.
[10:24:23] <MelodyCuida> is there any documentation about chassis?
[10:37:19] <sfrisk> Not much right now, minus what are the goals for each phase of the project
[10:37:39] <sfrisk> like I said, we're currently developing the css framework components, so there hasn't been the need for documentation yet
[10:38:35] <MelodyCuida> so I should be involved in the phase one too
[10:39:23] <sfrisk> it would be helpful.  I do encourage you to join in on discussions happening in the issues right now
[10:39:34] <sfrisk> and we have a weekly meeting on Tuesdays
[10:39:45] <sfrisk> http://meetings.jquery.org
[10:39:49] <MelodyCuida> and actually CMS theme creation is in phase three
[10:41:07] <MelodyCuida> I see that and I find that I missed the last one...
[10:42:25] <sfrisk> the UI component creation part is part of phase 2
[10:42:37] <sfrisk> but the earlier adoption we can have, the better
[10:42:59] <sfrisk> I mean it's called phase three, but really, it's kinda encouraging people to use it as soon as there is something to adopt
[10:46:31] <MelodyCuida> yeah, the process of creating a theme is composed the creation of many UI components, which I should focus on
[10:48:57] <sfrisk> Yup, although you probably won't have to focus on the more complicated UI components that would be needed for an application
[10:49:03] <sfrisk> just for a basic website
[10:49:48] <MelodyCuida> Your advice is of much help to me, thank you
[10:50:36] <sfrisk> no problem, that's what I'm here for
[10:53:35] <MelodyCuida> I wish you a speedy recovery, sfrisk. It's late and I'll go to sleep. Bye.
[10:58:54] <trailofdad> sfrisk, started mucking around last night with some sass buttons using the font we are looking at using
[10:58:57] <trailofdad> http://codepen.io/trailofdad/pen/ZYVoLo
[11:00:19] <trailofdad> still a bunch of stuff to do with that but figured I would throw together a couple of complonets to look at my code
[11:01:18] <sfrisk> cool
[11:01:52] <sfrisk> one thing I might suggest looking at, is that I know we were discussing Material Design at one point
[11:02:15] <sfrisk> so maybe look at their buttons? http://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-usage
[11:02:47] <sfrisk> I mean, we may not go the material design direction either
[11:02:54] <trailofdad> ohhh yes
[11:02:55] <sfrisk> but it was something that was discussed
[11:02:58] <trailofdad> ive actually been working on that
[11:03:11] <trailofdad> I have a pen there with a blank sheet of "material"
[11:15:28] <sfrisk> nice
[11:20:43] <trailofdad> sfrisk, check out the first button. that should be material design standard
[11:20:45] <trailofdad> http://codepen.io/trailofdad/pen/ZYVoLo
[11:22:05] <trailofdad> im going to change all of them to be like that
[11:25:37] <trailofdad> or a few
[11:35:13] <sfrisk> nice
[12:07:06] <ramasilveyra> Hello everybody!
[13:09:44] <GreatDanton> sfrisk, ping
[13:11:21] <sfrisk> yes?
[13:11:47] <GreatDanton> where can I send you my proposal for review?
[13:12:49] <sfrisk> send it to my email on github
[13:13:03] <GreatDanton> okay
[13:13:06] <sfrisk> or to google, I can review it there to
[13:13:07] <sfrisk> o
[13:13:34] <GreatDanton> you mean google docs?
[13:15:59] <GreatDanton> sent
[13:16:13] <sfrisk> I meant thrugh the gsoc program
[13:16:19] <sfrisk> you can edit it multiple times there
[13:16:21] <sfrisk> but email works too
[13:16:24] <sfrisk> will look at later today
[13:16:31] <GreatDanton> I didn't know that
[13:16:33] <GreatDanton> okay
[13:17:57] <GreatDanton> sfrisk, what's the best way to add html/css text on website.
[13:18:07] <sfrisk> for a code sample?
[13:18:12] <sfrisk> Link to a codepen or a jsbin
[13:18:12] <GreatDanton> yes
[13:18:28] <sfrisk> like http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/BymJer
[13:18:38] <sfrisk> just be like "here is a thing I made" and link to it
[13:19:02] <GreatDanton> well I created another page on my website
[13:19:57] <sfrisk> then link to that
[13:20:11] <GreatDanton> I did, but I didn't add the code
[13:34:36] <FreemanLou> Hi there, my name is Freeman Lou, and I would like to contribute to chassis by working on the chassis website
[13:34:49] <sfrisk> I would suggest against that, FreemanLou
[13:35:09] <FreemanLou> Is the idea taken?
[13:55:17] <sfrisk> more just a CMS theme would be a higher priorit idea
[13:55:42] <FreemanLou> ok
[14:21:42] <ramasilveyra> I want to apply to Create a theme for a CMS that implements Chassis but I see that there is no components so I think that Styling Components for JS Libraries it's priority. Right?
[14:22:48] <ramasilveyra> I really want to collaborate with css chasis.
[19:01:16] <ramasilveyra> Hello arschmitz
