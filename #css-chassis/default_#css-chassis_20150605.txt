[09:03:09] <sfrisk> GSOC mini meeting time!
[09:03:31] <sfrisk> arschmitz, geekman-rohit
[09:03:47] <geekman-rohit_> https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1M0qXlukfYPXM-TLBqWk5oVHBPmHMHzqj3OTv60zxz7Q/edit
[09:05:43] <geekman-rohit_> its open to edit
[09:06:11] <sfrisk> okay, trying to figure out how best to organize errors
[09:06:22] <sfrisk> since there will probably be an 'error' color
[09:06:39] <sfrisk> but there will most likely be error states for various inputs/labels/notifications/etc
[09:07:37] <geekman-rohit_> i think we can decide that once we have error variables decided
[09:08:03] <geekman-rohit_> if you and arschmitz approve of this heirarchy thing, tabs and accordians
[09:08:10] <arschmitz> sorry here
[09:08:15] <geekman-rohit_> and the basic layout
[09:08:49] <geekman-rohit_> hey arschmitz
[09:09:14] <arschmitz> so the start of the layout looks good
[09:09:14] <sfrisk> ping michaelarestad
[09:09:30] <arschmitz> i agree i would not get hung up on individual componenets yeat just get the layout
[09:09:36] <sfrisk> true
[09:09:39] <arschmitz> chassis will fill in the blanks as its developed
[09:09:41] <sfrisk> the layout looks like it works to me
[09:10:10] <geekman-rohit_> I am still not sure what will be easier, a paletter below there using a fixed positioning
[09:10:16] <geekman-rohit_> or to the right
[09:10:35] <geekman-rohit_> below there will be closer to drag and drop actually
[09:10:36] <arschmitz> one minor thing
[09:10:42] <arschmitz> i think i would push the accoprdions down
[09:10:52] <arschmitz> and extend the secondary toolbar all the way across
[09:12:10] <geekman-rohit_> okay, and the Tab/Select option to select coponent?
[09:12:16] <geekman-rohit_> that goes down too?
[09:12:58] <sfrisk> that could work, arschmitz
[09:13:00] <arschmitz> im not sure what you mean?
[09:13:07] <arschmitz> what tab select
[09:13:33] <sfrisk> I was wondering too if it might work if the lefthand menu is collapsable or capable of being extended more, depending on the needs of the variables
[09:14:01] <arschmitz> do you mean extend beyond the height of the screen?
[09:14:06] <arschmitz> or will it exactly fill?
[09:14:20] <sfrisk> width wise
[09:14:28] <sfrisk> I figure right now it's scrollable
[09:14:57] <geekman-rohit_> scrollable and the plan is expandable to a popup full screen box
[09:15:24] <michaelarestad> sfrisk: pong
[09:15:28] <geekman-rohit_> arschmitz, take a look now, is this what you meant?
[09:15:55] <michaelarestad> Ah. Looking.
[09:15:58] <sfrisk> michaelarestad: wasn't sure if you wanted to check out what geekman-rohit has so far for a wireframe and give you're input
[09:16:19] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit_: yes execpt i would space the controls to use the whole width
[09:16:26] <arschmitz> so push over the redo and undo
[09:16:31] <arschmitz> space things out
[09:16:50] <sfrisk> huh?
[09:16:56] <geekman-rohit_> i dont understand?
[09:17:04] <sfrisk> like add more space between redo/undo?
[09:17:09] <geekman-rohit_> umm if it takes just a moment, can yo ushow? its editable
[09:18:27] <arschmitz> like it is now
[09:18:53] <geekman-rohit_> so i understood right, um
[09:19:17] <arschmitz> when i looked when you said it at first the buttons were in their original place
[09:19:24] <arschmitz> and the toolbar was blank above the accordions
[09:19:31] <sfrisk> ahhh
[09:19:31] <arschmitz> maybe it just had not fully update
[09:20:37] <geekman-rohit_> oh i was moving them when you typed, probably
[09:20:53] <arschmitz> yeah it looks good now
[09:21:06] <arschmitz> we can tweak as we go but that looks like a good starting place
[09:21:21] <arschmitz> one thing we need to decide
[09:21:36] <sfrisk> which is?
[09:21:40] <arschmitz> is how responsive will this be like are we supporting making a theme on phone?
[09:21:56] <sfrisk> are we supporting making a theme on a phone?
[09:22:03] <geekman-rohit_> the number of inputs there will be
[09:22:06] <arschmitz> yes like going to theme roller on a phone
[09:22:11] <geekman-rohit_> i doubt it will be user friendly on a phone
[09:22:17] <arschmitz> and will it be expected to work reasonably
[09:22:26] <sfrisk> I could see it working on a tablet
[09:22:27] <arschmitz> or a tablet
[09:22:32] <arschmitz> will we support touch
[09:22:53] <sfrisk> so is the idea that they could login, create a theme on their phone, save it
[09:22:59] <sfrisk> then download it later on their desktop?
[09:23:02] <arschmitz> yes
[09:23:16] <sfrisk> well, I think the UI experience will be VERY different for phone
[09:23:21] <arschmitz> because geekman-rohit_ has talked about the ability to share and browse themes too
[09:23:34] <sfrisk> I can see share/browse themes working well on a phone
[09:23:34] <arschmitz> right im not saying we do or dont need to support this
[09:23:44] <geekman-rohit_> yes now that we are using a database, all of that i possible
[09:23:46] <arschmitz> just that we need to take it into account when designing
[09:23:53] <geekman-rohit_> yes
[09:23:55] <sfrisk> but actual editing of a theme will involve a lot of thought  if it works on a phone
[09:23:59] <arschmitz> also browser support
[09:24:05] <sfrisk> since you'll probably want to remove the lefthand bar
[09:24:08] <arschmitz> does the theme roller have the same support as the lib
[09:24:13] <arschmitz> or is it different
[09:24:19] <geekman-rohit_> but since we will eventually use chassis, making it responsive wont be difficult? i guess
[09:24:33] <arschmitz> its more then just responive though
[09:24:36] <sfrisk> and have it that when you click something on the page, it opens up a page/popup to tweak variables in
[09:24:50] <arschmitz> there is a dramatic difference when your talking about a ui with complex interactions and controls
[09:24:56] <sfrisk> Responsive is one thing, well designed User Experience in phone is another
[09:25:23] <arschmitz> browser support is a seperate concern too
[09:25:30] <geekman-rohit_> so are we talking of the same ui adjusting properly, or a different one for phones?
[09:25:33] <arschmitz> like since we support ie8 will the themeroller support ie8
[09:25:43] <arschmitz> it would need to be a whole different ui
[09:25:49] <arschmitz> i think
[09:25:50] <sfrisk> I think for the purposes of the GSOC project, focus should be on a desktop for an editing experience, and  multi device support for browsing themes
[09:26:07] <michaelarestad> I'll check out the wireframe shortly. Catching up on a week's worth of email/pings
[09:26:29] <sfrisk> no problem, michaelarestad
[09:26:43] <sfrisk> what is current browser support for the mobile themeroller ?
[09:26:43] <arschmitz> does anyone have thoughts about browser support?
[09:26:51] <arschmitz> uh none lol
[09:27:06] <geekman-rohit_> i think we should aim for the same as chassis
[09:27:13] <sfrisk> for the themeroller, I think we should cover modern browsers
[09:27:23] <geekman-rohit_> since we will use chassis, it cant be more than what chassis supports
[09:27:29] <sfrisk> supporting back to IE8 could take a lot more work than the scope of the project
[09:27:34] <sfrisk> for the user interaction stuff
[09:27:39] <geekman-rohit_> IE8 scares me though
[09:27:43] <sfrisk> lot more time* than the summer*
[09:27:50] <arschmitz> also
[09:27:59] <arschmitz> themeroller is not something we want to upgrade all the time
[09:28:09] <arschmitz> and ie8 goes away in 6 months basicly
[09:28:17] <sfrisk> thus, why not bothering to support older IE
[09:28:47] <sfrisk> at least for the themeroller
[09:28:48] <arschmitz> i honestly would be fine with current - 1 across the board on desktop
[09:29:02] <arschmitz> and preview only for anything else
[09:29:08] <arschmitz> for themeroller to start
[09:29:26] <arschmitz> well and maybe tablets
[09:29:33] <arschmitz> but even that could add a lot of work
[09:29:35] <geekman-rohit_> works with me, we can later expand to a better phone experience, and ie8(if we think its worth the effort)
[09:29:54] <sfrisk> so scope of the work for summer is a focus on Desktop experience for themeroller builder part
[09:30:05] <arschmitz> yeah i think so
[09:30:09] <geekman-rohit_> i would like to aim on the tablet part
[09:30:11] <arschmitz> tablet if we have time
[09:30:14] <sfrisk> and maybe allow for browsing/sharing themes for mobile devices
[09:30:21] <geekman-rohit_> but not as a deliverable in gsoc,
[09:30:26] <arschmitz> i think we should include a preview link
[09:30:26] <sfrisk> correct
[09:30:31] <arschmitz> that works on everything supported
[09:30:36] <arschmitz> because it should be just chassis
[09:30:47] <geekman-rohit_> sounds good
[09:31:02] <arschmitz> basicly the contents of the iframe in themeroller
[09:31:10] <sfrisk> yeah
[09:31:27] <sfrisk> could have some little icons at the top similar to what tumblr has for a post
[09:31:27] <geekman-rohit_> yeah
[09:31:50] <geekman-rohit_> icons reminds me, we need to decide what icons to use :P
[09:31:57] <sfrisk> http://tavern-wenches.tumblr.com/post/120544767661/codenewbie
[09:32:26] <sfrisk> so little icons for favoriting, editing, sharing, etc
[09:32:38] <sfrisk> haha, the great icon debate
[09:32:41] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit_: the chassis ones once we pick them
[09:33:01] <arschmitz> until then something svg
[09:33:03] <geekman-rohit_> makes sense
[09:33:13] <geekman-rohit_> until then openiconic
[09:33:18] <geekman-rohit_> is what im using
[09:33:23] <sfrisk> I think I had suggested a few svg icons the other day
[09:33:45] <geekman-rohit_> yes, based on sfrisks suggestion
[09:34:00] <geekman-rohit_> openiconic looks good, dont need many icons though
[09:34:13] <geekman-rohit_> share undo redo download is what i see as of now
[09:34:13] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit_: just make sure your using the svg not the font
[09:34:39] <geekman-rohit_> yep, sfrisk reminded me that just yesterday
[09:34:45] <arschmitz> awesome
[09:36:05] <geekman-rohit_> also if we have the time
[09:36:09] <geekman-rohit_> for the db
[09:36:13] <geekman-rohit_> sql vs nosql?
[09:36:27] <geekman-rohit_> if nosql mongodb vs couchdb
[09:36:49] <sfrisk> do you have a preference?
[09:37:08] <arschmitz> i would say if we go nosql couch
[09:37:12] <arschmitz> we are already using it
[09:37:23] <arschmitz> but we use mysql already too
[09:37:42] <geekman-rohit_> as for themeroller mysql is something to heavy?
[09:37:47] <arschmitz> no
[09:38:06] <geekman-rohit_> i mean we just need to store and retrieve, not much other functionality required
[09:38:13] <arschmitz> im perfectly fine with mysql people know it its easy
[09:38:22] <arschmitz> we use it already
[09:38:27] <sfrisk> mysql it is then
[09:38:36] <geekman-rohit_> couchdb?
[09:38:44] <geekman-rohit_> or mysql?
[09:38:46] <arschmitz> we use that for perf testing
[09:38:59] <geekman-rohit_> im more used to mysql too
[09:39:02] <sfrisk> do you have a preference for what you would like to work with geekman-rohit?
[09:39:04] <geekman-rohit_> so makes things easy for me
[09:39:05] <arschmitz> then to mysql
[09:39:16] <geekman-rohit_> great
[09:39:16] <arschmitz> way more people are familiar with it
[09:39:39] <arschmitz> its simple enough to use with node
[09:39:45] <arschmitz> though transactions can be tricky
[09:40:06] <geekman-rohit_> we wouldnt need transactions much here, I guess
[09:40:11] <arschmitz> if you decide you need transactions for all the social stuff let me know
[09:40:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: and i spent some time on this for a different project
[09:40:45] <arschmitz> its a non trivial issue to be sure
[09:41:10] <geekman-rohit_> are we aiming at doing the social stuff within summer?
[09:41:37] <sfrisk> I don't think so
[09:41:44] <arschmitz> i dont know that was your idea and and its in your mock up
[09:41:53] <arschmitz> so if not you should remove it from the moc up
[09:42:07] <sfrisk> or how social are we talking?
[09:42:08] <geekman-rohit_> oh yes the name and sharing link, and probably a featured page, yes
[09:42:17] <sfrisk> I hear social I think fb and stuff
[09:42:22] <geekman-rohit_> me too
[09:42:36] <arschmitz> oh i didnt think that
[09:42:36] <geekman-rohit_> like like and start +1
[09:42:48] <arschmitz> but i dont have facebook
[09:42:49] <geekman-rohit_> star*
[09:43:29] <geekman-rohit_> okay give me like the weekend to do some research
[09:43:30] <arschmitz> i just thought you meant creating shareing galarys search etc
[09:43:32] <geekman-rohit_> on db
[09:43:45] <geekman-rohit_> im having second thoughts
[09:43:58] <geekman-rohit_> our data is json, couchdb will make things awefully simpler
[09:44:17] <arschmitz> im fine with either
[09:44:21] <sfrisk> then go with couchdb
[09:44:26] <arschmitz> i had previously mentioned couchdb for that reason
[09:44:37] <sfrisk> I'm not particularly picky, it's really what would be easiest for you
[09:44:40] <geekman-rohit_> ill let you all know in next meeting, ill use both and see what suits
[09:44:43] <arschmitz> but i know mysql better and others tend to as well
[09:44:50] <geekman-rohit_> great :)
[09:45:03] <sfrisk> but we can also probably hit up some couchdb resources if we need to
[09:45:09] <arschmitz> yes
[09:45:14] <arschmitz> its not an issue either way
[09:45:20] <arschmitz> what ever works
[09:45:32] <arschmitz> i mean we use couchdb already for perf
[09:45:57] <geekman-rohit_> yep
[09:47:14] <arschmitz> I also have some resources i can reach out to on couch stuff and i assume sfrisk knows and can get the same person / people
[09:47:17] <geekman-rohit_> that answers a lot of stuff for me!
[09:47:29] <sfrisk> yup
[09:47:55] <sfrisk> (away from keyboard, have some stuff to look at at another coworker's desk)
[09:48:21] <geekman-rohit_> see ya sfrisk, thanks for your time
[09:49:43] <geekman-rohit_> arschmitz one last question
[09:50:01] <arschmitz> sure
[09:50:04] <geekman-rohit_> what os are will the api servers use?
[09:50:22] <arschmitz> well that likely depends on which db you choose actually
[09:50:22] <geekman-rohit_> what do we use now ?
[09:50:34] <arschmitz> everything execpt the couch server is on debian
[09:50:46] <arschmitz> debian and couch dont play nice so thats on centos
[09:51:37] <arschmitz> we puppetize everything
[09:51:40] <geekman-rohit_> great , i thought we had a preference there already
[09:52:17] <sfrisk> and back
[09:52:34] <arschmitz> yeah i would say centos if you go couch debian otherwise
[09:52:47] <geekman-rohit_> your opinion on mongodb?
[09:53:33] <geekman-rohit_> that should work everywhere
[09:54:04] <arschmitz> i dont like it
[09:54:34] <arschmitz> mysql works everywhere too
[09:54:36] <geekman-rohit_> :D okay
[09:54:48] <arschmitz> im not saying you cant use it
[09:54:58] <arschmitz> but none of us i know of use it
[09:55:05] <arschmitz> so resources will be a lot more limited too
[09:55:54] <sfrisk> on the project I'm working on currently, we have stored data in json form in the db
[09:55:59] <sfrisk> with mysql
[09:56:05] <arschmitz> yup iv done that too
[09:56:14] <geekman-rohit_> as TEXT?
[09:56:19] <arschmitz> use throw it in a blob or text
[09:56:29] <geekman-rohit_> stringify it and store
[09:56:40] <geekman-rohit_> im only worried about not indexing mysql schemas properly
[09:57:14] <sfrisk> I've normally done it as blob
[09:57:45] <geekman-rohit_> okay so sfrisk can help me with designing the schema right? with proper indexes and stuff??
[09:57:53] <sfrisk> sure
[09:58:01] <geekman-rohit_> great
[09:58:30] <arschmitz> the down fall
[09:58:34] <arschmitz> is indexing and searching
[09:58:37] <sfrisk> yeah
[09:58:42] <arschmitz> you can also use a stored method
[09:58:49] <arschmitz> to decode json
[09:58:58] <arschmitz> so you pass in json but it stores in a table
[09:59:04] <arschmitz> in individual fields
[09:59:04] <geekman-rohit_> thats what worries me ya
[09:59:23] <sfrisk> I think also for themes
[09:59:30] <geekman-rohit_> if not done right, the performance can be BAD
[09:59:33] <sfrisk> we might want to be able to assign not only the title, but some keywords
[09:59:40] <arschmitz> btu if done right its better lol
[09:59:58] <arschmitz> we dont need to store theme vars individually
[10:00:06] <arschmitz> there is no need to search or index them
[10:00:08] <geekman-rohit_> a blob is good
[10:00:16] <geekman-rohit_> we wont need to search on the theme vars
[10:00:16] <arschmitz> you would only store the meta data in its own fields
[10:00:28] <arschmitz> so you could have a stored method
[10:00:32] <arschmitz> that you pass json to
[10:00:45] <arschmitz> that takes the keys and stores them in coresponding fields
[10:00:57] <arschmitz> you just need to design your table schema correctly
[10:01:11] <arschmitz> the whole theme would just be a single field
[10:01:44] <geekman-rohit_> ill play couch db and mysql with both with large json data
[10:01:46] <arschmitz> so each row would have fields for each piece of meta data and a blob for the theme
[10:02:05] <arschmitz> i would dare say performance will be better with mysql if you do it right
[10:02:12] <geekman-rohit_> how many columns are we looking at
[10:02:14] <geekman-rohit_> in the table
[10:02:31] <arschmitz> #of meta data fields plus a couple
[10:02:41] <arschmitz> actually probably just meta + 1
[10:02:46] <geekman-rohit_> themename, id, and the blob data , timestamp, update timestamp
[10:02:49] <geekman-rohit_> any more?
[10:02:58] <arschmitz> well when you go social
[10:03:00] <arschmitz> keywords
[10:03:11] <geekman-rohit_> comma separated string?
[10:03:15] <arschmitz> download count maybe
[10:03:23] <arschmitz> yes i would say so
[10:03:38] <geekman-rohit_> so we are looking at 10, at the most 15?
[10:03:43] <arschmitz> yeah not many
[10:04:02] <arschmitz> with couch db you actually lose out because the whole theme will actually be data
[10:04:02] <geekman-rohit_> and in index on keywords, and id maybe name
[10:04:18] <arschmitz> to get any real architectural advantage
[10:05:03] <geekman-rohit_> instead on stored methods we could just build a query and pass it
[10:05:10] <arschmitz> yes
[10:05:19] <arschmitz> stored method is just a convience
[10:05:19] <geekman-rohit_> i can write a function to generate it from an array/json
[10:05:31] <arschmitz> it makes little difference in this case
[10:05:36] <arschmitz> i generally do functions
[10:05:41] <geekman-rohit_> me too
[10:05:43] <arschmitz> vs stored methods
[10:05:55] <arschmitz> some times stored methods are faster
[10:06:04] <arschmitz> because they word directly in the db but i dont think its a concern
[10:06:17] <geekman-rohit_> sounds good
[10:06:45] <arschmitz> i have not really had to deal with a db in like 3 years lol
[10:08:28] <geekman-rohit_> i have (mysql) like daily
[10:10:01] <arschmitz> i used to
[10:10:16] <arschmitz> just not any more  execpt once in a while for somethign random like perf
[10:11:46] <geekman-rohit_> hmm so i think that was all my queries
