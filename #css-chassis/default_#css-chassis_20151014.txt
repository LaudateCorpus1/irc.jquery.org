[15:32:13] <arschmitz> sfrisk: now sure if we care but it was just pointed out to me by someone that a lot of css people wont be around weekend of hackathon because its travel days for cssdevconf
[15:44:39] <sfrisk> Okay. I mean, we had picked that date due to the doodle that was posted for the past few meetings, but I can make a new doodle and post it in the issue
[15:45:07] <sfrisk> but I'm fine with moving it to sometime in November if that works better
[16:04:32] <arschmitz> sfrisk: Yeah it was pointed out by one of the speakers who has talked about helping out on chassis ( she was trying to come to NYC but could not get time off )
[16:04:49] <sfrisk> I can make a more public new doodle for November
[16:04:54] <sfrisk> see what I can do
[16:05:07] <sfrisk> make a more official event out of it maybe
[16:05:13] <arschmitz> yeah
[16:05:14] <sfrisk> Do some google hangouts
[16:05:19] <sfrisk> Lightning talks maybe
[16:05:33] <arschmitz> maybe pick a weekend and have the jquery twitter account tweet it
[16:05:39] <sfrisk> probably works out better for me too, since I think next weekend I'll probably just want to curl up into a ball and sleep
[16:05:53] <arschmitz> and do a blog post even
[16:05:59] <sfrisk> Want to get some time to work on a plan for it at NYC?
[16:06:06] <arschmitz> sure
[16:06:22] <sfrisk> awesome
[16:06:49] <arschmitz> ill talk to the person from cssdevconf too because they do a lot of talks and have done event organizing and have like 8000 followers
[16:07:03] <arschmitz> so they might be able to get the word out if they want to help with it
[16:08:47] <arschmitz> mid november things should calm down for me too guests will be gone ill be in new house we should be public at work so slightly less crazy maybe lol ( but i get OSS time then so theres that at least )
[16:13:02] <sfrisk> Yeah, things have been a bit nuts with a project at work lately, and I've been super focused on working on my talk for Connect JS that I hadn't had a chance to do more organizing before this weekend
