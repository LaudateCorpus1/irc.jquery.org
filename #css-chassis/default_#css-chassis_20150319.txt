[02:10:31] <Amit_> why is there no official website of css-chassis ?
[02:23:11] <Amit_> anyone online ?
[03:15:08] <MelodyCuida> I want to ask this question too. But I find that there is an idea in the GSoC list that targets your question.
[03:21:41] <MelodyCuida> I want to know the emails of mentors, how can I get that information? Thanks!
[07:04:22] <trailofdad> sfrisk, looking at the minutes from the last meeting. I'm curious if anything has been decided upon with regards to auto-generated documentation
[07:04:47] <trailofdad> and if thats the way we will want to do the pattern library
[07:04:50] <arschmitz> trailofdad: we never got to that topic
[07:05:34] <arschmitz> trailofdad: i think the general consensus has been against it but no firm decision yet
[07:05:45] <sfrisk> although I think in general we're leaning towards not doing auto-generated documentation
[07:05:52] <sfrisk> wait, nm, arschmitz just said that
[07:06:08] <trailofdad> ok cool, thats what I was seeing in the github discussion
[07:06:22] <arschmitz> :-) sfrisk well at least we are on the same page
[07:06:30] <sfrisk> true
[07:06:52] <trailofdad> just going over the ways to impliment the pattern library for my GSoC proposal
[07:07:18] <arschmitz> trailofdad: i really dont think there is an automated way to do that
[07:09:01] <arschmitz> trailofdad: even with automated docs you need a lot to fully create a pattern library, you need the full structure for each variation of a component and also a way to get a proper list of components
[07:09:51] <trailofdad> ok great, thats what I was thinking, so I'm on the right track :D
[07:10:24] <trailofdad> just trying to cover all of the discussions on the topic so I'm in-line with what is decided upon
[07:10:50] <arschmitz> trailofdad: sure and to be fair we are already doing something like this in perf testing and it is automated
[07:11:01] <arschmitz> trailofdad: but it also points out how crazy this can get
[07:11:29] <arschmitz> trailofdad: like semantic ui even only using 4 icons has ~28,000 possible variations on a button
[07:11:54] <trailofdad> woah
[07:12:11] <arschmitz> now i dont think we will have anything like that
[07:12:28] <arschmitz> but it just points out the need for human moderation of what variations are important and should be shown
[07:12:29] <trailofdad> I hope not  :D
[07:12:48] <trailofdad> right, and those would be decided amongst the team?
[07:13:02] <arschmitz> on something that needs to be a fairly concise overview like the pattern library
[07:13:21] <arschmitz> yeah i would expect you to make suggestions as part of your work
[07:13:29] <arschmitz> and then those would be discussed by the team
[07:14:02] <trailofdad> ok awesome, thanks. That gives me a good jumpoff point
[07:14:13] <arschmitz> trailofdad: great glad we could help
[07:14:32] <trailofdad> the actual page, would that be built using the standards laid out in phase 1?
[07:16:17] <arschmitz> basicly yea
[08:39:38] <trailofdad> arschmitz: do you think that the pattern library might have its own repo? It seems like we might have to make documentation and updating the pattern library a part of the workflow when working on the UI componets to keep everything up to date
[08:39:48] <trailofdad> has that been a problem with your projects in the past?
[08:42:43] <trailofdad> I like the idea of having the auto generation take care of changes in the source code, but I can also see it bloating the code with comments
[08:43:10] <trailofdad> I guess thats the debate for/against auto-generated docs
[10:41:50] <sfrisk> trailofdad: did arschmitz answer your question?/
[12:15:02] <meakaakka> Hello I would like to contribute to the chasssis website.
[12:25:27] <michaelarestad> I:D
[12:26:14] <trailofdad> sfrisk: no he didn't
[12:26:55] <trailofdad> what are your thoughts on that
[12:27:07] <sfrisk> okay, so I don't think pattern library would go in its own repo
[12:27:17] <sfrisk> but in like a demo folder of the app
[12:27:44] <sfrisk> so that way it's pulling from your local css file or whatever, so when you're testing, you can immediately see how your styling changes have effected the components
[12:28:07] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: hey
[12:28:11] <trailofdad> right, that makes sense
[12:28:21] <sfrisk> similar to what jquery mobile does: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/master/demos
[12:29:51] <michaelarestad> arschmitz: howdy
[12:30:57] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: feeling better?
[12:31:33] <michaelarestad> A bit. Headache isn't as devastating today.
[12:31:47] <arschmitz> Well thats somethin
[12:31:54] <michaelarestad> Yep
[12:35:22] <meakaakka> arschmitz I would like to add the demos and tutorials. Can you tell me from where should I get started?
[12:35:39] <trailofdad> sfrisk: gotcha. looks like a great way to break everything down
[12:36:03] <sfrisk> I would suggest against doing that meakaakka
[12:36:19] <sfrisk> We need work done more on UI components than demos and tutorials
[12:40:23] <arschmitz> meakaakka: what sfrisk said
[12:41:41] <meakaakka> got it. So we need to work on creating a Pattern Library of Chassis components?
[12:42:56] <trailofdad> meakaakka thats a task for the summer I believe
[12:43:15] <meakaakka> True
