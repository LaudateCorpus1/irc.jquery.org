[04:19:49] <nashvail> was wondering if changing "start": "grunt watch" to "start": "grunt build && grunt watch" in package.json would be a good idea
[04:33:42] <geekman-rohit> nashvail you can start a PR for that too
[04:35:23] <nashvail> Alright, all these PRs are discussed in the meeting ?
[04:35:33] <geekman-rohit> Insteas of that. I think you can set the atBegin option in watch
[04:35:51] <geekman-rohit> Which will run the tasts when watch starts
[04:36:01] <geekman-rohit> Tasks *
[04:36:23] <nashvail> hmm.. makes sense
[04:36:25] <geekman-rohit> Yes. We will discuss them on Tuesday and if everyone thinks they are good to go we merge them in
[04:37:11] <nashvail> Alright üëç
[04:39:55] <geekman-rohit> Fix it un ur existing PR for now
[04:43:01] <geekman-rohit> Or make a separate one
[04:51:34] <nashvail> Think I should make a separate one, I am having little problem with the last PR though, grunt build runs on detecting changes in variables but the chassis.scss file holding variables doesn't update to reflect the changes. Looking into that
[04:51:58] <nashvail> manually running grunt build works
[05:41:22] <nashvail> changing spawn to true in watch.js sass tasks fixes the problem
[05:41:43] <nashvail> task(
[05:41:45] <nashvail> task*
[05:47:23] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] nashvail opened pull request #147: Grunt: 'grunt watch' runs all tasks at beginning (master...gw-build-on-begin) https://git.io/vanuB
[07:27:16] <geekman-rohit> Spawn may reduce response time of the watch
[09:19:06] <nashvail> geekman-rohit: Yes, I noticed it does  by a second or so. But spawn is disabled the chassis.scss is not updated. Any workarounds you can think of ?
[09:19:16] <nashvail> But if *
[09:38:57] <geekman-rohit> I'll see.. I have faced problem with grunt build too on ubuntu
[09:39:26] <geekman-rohit> If we can't find any other solution.. we can go ahead with this
[10:59:29] <nashvail> Alright, I'll also keep looking for a different solution
