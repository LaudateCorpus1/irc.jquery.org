[13:07:47] <codenirvana> Hello mentors I am Intrested in chassis website project and so already started working on this.
[13:09:53] <codenirvana> I am working with jquery-wp-content currently and want to discuss about it.
[13:10:39] <geekman-rohit> Hey codenirvana
[13:11:06] <geekman-rohit> You have any queries?
[13:11:12] <codenirvana> Is chassis plaining for website similiar to every jquery.com website using jquery-wp-content or we can create something totally different?
[13:13:49] <geekman-rohit> The ui can be totally different
[13:14:06] <geekman-rohit> But the website should preferably use jquery-wp-content
[13:15:49] <codenirvana> Ok, Thanks for clarifying.
