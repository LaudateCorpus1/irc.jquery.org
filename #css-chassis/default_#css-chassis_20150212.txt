[04:37:09] <aspirar> Hi, I want to contribute to Chassis. I saw the issue tracker, but I don't know how I will be able to contribute. I am quite new to open source, and I know html, css and js, though now an expert :). If there is some beginner level task, please let me know :)
[04:39:37] <aspirar> Oops, I meant not an expert above, not now an expert.
[04:39:49] <aspirar> I am NOT an expert.
[05:05:31] <arschmitz> aspirar: no problem,
[05:07:47] <arschmitz> aspirar: Right now its a little hard right now because we are in pretty early stages... But very soon we will have lots of stuff. Right now opinions on issue are good. Also if you have used other css frame works, Things you liked, didn't like, would like to see in chassis etc
[05:09:01] <arschmitz> aspirar: we also have weekly meetings at 1pm EST on tuesdays in #jquery-meeting
[05:09:37] <aspirar> Yes, I checked the meeting logs. Unfortunately, that time doesn't suit my time zone.
[05:10:06] <aspirar> But thanks, I will try to give valuable opinions on issues :)
[05:26:56] <arschmitz> aspirar: pretty soon we will have a lot of easier things to do, once we start actually coding, building websites, etc...
[05:28:28] <aspirar> arschmitz: And pretty soon, I will be more proficient so that I can contribute more than just on the easy parts :)
[05:33:30] <arschmitz> aspirar: Sounds good :-)
