[06:58:42] <ronnel> Hey, I was thinking of joining the Chasis project for GSOC, any pointers?
[07:02:05] <arschmitz> ronnel: which task were you interested in?
[07:14:00] <ronnel> Styling components for JS libraries
[07:25:35] <sfrisk> ronnel: I suggest looking at both jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile and finding similar widgets between the two.
[07:25:51] <sfrisk> since part of that work will involve coming up with a standard implementation of those items
[07:26:08] <sfrisk> and you should address what components you will work on over the course of the summer
[07:26:17] <sfrisk> and factor that into your timeline
[07:26:33] <sfrisk> I also suggest you include a code sample to show us what you're abilities are with html/scss
[07:26:52] <sfrisk> an example of what I would be looking for: http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/BymJer
[07:38:28] <ronnel> So I would be developing other components like this that can be used with JS Libraries
[07:38:48] <ronnel> kind of like polymer?
[09:22:09] <sfrisk> Reminder, there is a Chassis meeting today in 38 minutes!
[10:00:39] <sfrisk> Meeting time in #jquery-meeting
[10:29:43] <Cuida> The meeting will start 30min later, right?
[10:30:49] <sfrisk> no we're in the meeting right now
[10:30:52] <sfrisk> in #jquery-meeting
[10:34:46] <Cuida> thank you!
[11:16:09] <ramasilveyra> If anyone missed the meeting: http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/default_%23jquery-meeting_20150324.log.html
[18:20:20] <HOLLYDEE> Hello everyone, My name is lanre, i am new here, i applied for the Chassis project (Styling Components for JS Libraries).Any help? Thanks.
[19:13:51] <HOLLYDEE> hello sfrisk
[19:14:17] <arschmitz> HOLLYDEE: Hi how can we help you
[19:16:17] <HOLLYDEE> yh, thanks. I applied for the chassis project: Styling components for JS Libraries precisely....i need hints on how to get started
[19:16:49] <arschmitz> HOLLYDEE: what is the name you applied under ?
[19:17:21] <HOLLYDEE> Chassis - Styling Components for JS Libraries
[19:18:07] <arschmitz> HOLLYDEE: you said you applied already whats your name you applied to GSoC with
[19:19:20] <HOLLYDEE> Abidogun Olanrewaju.If you are referring to proposal, i havnt prepared it
[19:19:36] <arschmitz> ok so you have not applied yet
[19:20:04] <HOLLYDEE> yes, i havnt submited my proposal yet
[19:20:21] <arschmitz> HOLLYDEE: we already have 6 proposals on that task
[19:20:34] <arschmitz> and we can only accept 1 so you might be better off picking something else
[19:20:56] <HOLLYDEE> i got to know about this late, and i am trying to make up for the lost time
[19:21:17] <HOLLYDEE> woah...,what do you suggest
[19:21:55] <HOLLYDEE> I have the basic knowledge of the perecusites
[19:23:02] <sfrisk> also for people interested in styling components for JS libraries
[19:23:20] <HOLLYDEE> I am proficient with HTML, CSS and i also have the basic knowledge of javascript.
[19:23:21] <sfrisk> we're looking for a code sample using codepen or jsbin showing us your html/css skills
[19:23:29] <sfrisk> coding up some sort of widget
[19:23:38] <sfrisk> an example of what I am looking for is:
[19:23:58] <sfrisk> http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/BymJer
[19:24:15] <sfrisk> I need to see an example of you flexing your SCSS/html chops
[19:24:46] <sfrisk> not only for your coding style, but this project does require a bit of eye for design
[19:26:34] <sfrisk> also you would be styling/marking up components common to jQuery UI and jQuery Mobole
[19:27:28] <sfrisk> so if you did a proposal for that project, I would want a detailed list on what sort of components you would be marking up
[19:27:47] <sfrisk> and a timeline of when you would be delivering each of those components
[19:30:17] <HOLLYDEE> Anyone there to help out ?
[19:31:30] <sfrisk> Did you miss what I just told you?
[21:43:50] <ronnel> So, i started working on a codepen demo for the GSOC, just have one question, does it have to be strictly written in CSS, and what component would make for a good demo?
