[11:36:23] <michaelarestad> arschmitz sfrisk: My roommate just made a good point. Turning off Media Queries isn't really best practice if we're going for best practices with this thing.
[11:36:41] <sfrisk> true
[11:36:46] <arschmitz> it is if you are making something specificly for only mobile devices in a hybrid app
[11:36:50] <michaelarestad> Yes, we can make it an option.
[11:36:57] <michaelarestad> But that's still not best practice.
[11:37:03] <sfrisk> well it won't be a default option
[11:37:15] <sfrisk> we'll make a note that says "welp, we think you're silly to do things this way, buuuut"
[11:37:29] <michaelarestad> I don't even want to do that.
[11:37:34] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: what is not best practice about it in something that has no reason to be responsive
[11:37:54] <michaelarestad> If you're building for web, a thing should be responsive.
[11:37:55] <arschmitz> there are many hybrid apps that run only on iphones for example not even ipads
[11:37:58] <michaelarestad> That's pretty much end of story.
[11:38:04] <michaelarestad> Even if it's only a little bit.
[11:38:04] <arschmitz> michaelarestad:  thats not web
[11:38:11] <arschmitz> that hybrid
[11:38:19] <michaelarestad> True.
[11:38:30] <arschmitz> its a packed app only distributed to your chosen platforms and deivces
[11:38:46] <arschmitz> its one of the main uses of jQuery mobile
[11:38:56] <michaelarestad> Interesting.
[11:39:00] <arschmitz> phonegap and cordova
[11:39:07] <michaelarestad> Kinda grosses me out a little, but I get why.
[11:39:24] <michaelarestad> Okay. Cool.
[11:39:33] <arschmitz> im not saying you should do it for the web
[11:39:43] <michaelarestad> This whole thing kinda brings up a need for maybe a media query mixin.
[11:39:44] <arschmitz> im saying there are legit usecases where it is best to exclude them
[11:39:55] <michaelarestad> If so, I've got a few pretty crazy ones just lying around.
[11:40:38] <michaelarestad> (Note that I prefer media queries avoid mixins, but it's a pretty popular/common thing in larger projects)
[11:40:47] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: in packaged apps like that its important to keep things minimal because things are buggy enough in them lol extra unsed css is just aksing for problems
[11:41:16] <michaelarestad> Do Media queries even function in a hybrid app?
[11:41:21] <arschmitz> yes
[11:41:28] <arschmitz> there is still a viewport
[11:41:33] <michaelarestad> And with the latest WWDC announcement, I'd still suggest including them there
[11:41:44] <arschmitz> and some run on both ipad and iphone
[11:41:46] <michaelarestad> Split screen is gonna mess up a bunch of stuff.
[11:41:48] <arschmitz> so some apps need them
[11:42:03] <michaelarestad> Right.
[11:42:12] <michaelarestad> Even apps just running on an ipad will need them
[11:42:16] <arschmitz> yes
[11:43:01] <arschmitz> im all for encouraging them to always be included
[11:43:09] <michaelarestad> The more I think about it, the more I think apps should just have them always included. Yeah.
[11:43:25] <arschmitz> just believe there needs to for that use case be an option to exclude them
[11:43:59] <sfrisk> yeah, we've not enough mobile web app dev here to understand the need
[11:44:10] <sfrisk> even if i do prefer everything responsive
[11:44:46] <michaelarestad> Our devs are doing pretty much everything responsive. It's not even optional at this point. Even the native stuff.
[11:44:55] <arschmitz> people that make hybrid apps are nuts trust me i deal with them a lot
[11:45:07] <arschmitz> we have had people fight for an option to exclude aria stuff
[11:45:19] <michaelarestad> lol
[11:45:19] <arschmitz> even though voice over is still a thing in aps
[11:45:26] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[11:45:48] <michaelarestad> I can't even understand why they would make that argument, but I'm also not interested in super fringe cases.
[11:45:48] <arschmitz> i have never acomodated this accessibility is not an option there is not an actual use case for this
[11:46:04] <michaelarestad> Right.
[11:46:13] <arschmitz> they some how believed it would improve the performance of their app
[11:50:38] <arschmitz> meh im less convinced this is important
[11:50:58] <arschmitz> im kinda ok with telling people to get over it that they are "future proofing" their app lol
[11:51:04] <arschmitz> not true but it sounds good
[11:51:45] <michaelarestad> lol
[11:52:13] <michaelarestad> "You seem like the kinda person who wants to be future friendly, right?"
[11:53:37] <arschmitz> and if we dont care about excluding im not sure a mixin is needed
[11:53:52] <arschmitz> since we will want the specific breakpoints to be variables anyway
[11:54:35] <michaelarestad> Right.
[11:54:36] <michaelarestad> Well.
[11:54:43] <michaelarestad> Wait till you see my mixins
[11:54:52] <michaelarestad> (Still think we should avoid them)
[11:54:55] <arschmitz> lol
[11:55:12] <arschmitz> im just not sure we need them with the variable approach we seem to be taking?
[11:55:49] <michaelarestad> Right.
[11:55:53] <arschmitz> im not for or against them i just want to know the advantage
[11:55:56] <michaelarestad> But check this beast out: http://sassmeister.com/gist/c00db22ed4882680fc91
[11:56:12] <michaelarestad> Even throws useful errors
[11:56:37] <michaelarestad> I think I might have one for every philosophy
[11:56:39] <arschmitz> nice
[11:56:41] <michaelarestad> One has set variables
[11:56:55] <michaelarestad> One just lets you write a number with a modifier
[11:57:24] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: well you can incorporate as much logic as you want when you define your variable too
[11:57:38] <arschmitz> it moves the location of the logic though
[11:58:06] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: that aside do we need something like that
[11:58:12] <michaelarestad> right
[11:58:15] <arschmitz> i though we wanted to provide just a very basic set of break points
[11:58:31] <michaelarestad> Could even be as simple as this: http://sassmeister.com/gist/266ffe19ea4db90606eb
[11:58:39] <arschmitz> since the majority of responsive stuff is application specific
[11:58:50] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[11:59:00] <michaelarestad> I think we're on the same page there.
[11:59:35] <arschmitz> also with the mixin like hat
[11:59:47] <arschmitz> dont you essentially lost the ability to set your break points with variables?
[12:00:00] <michaelarestad> Nah
[12:00:30] <michaelarestad> @include breakpoint( 'max-width: ' + $large ){}
[12:00:56] <arschmitz> http://sassmeister.com/gist/266ffe19ea4db90606eb
[12:00:57] <michaelarestad> Here's another one that's more variable-based: https://gist.github.com/MichaelArestad/a100ccdb74573ab2ef7a
[12:00:58] <arschmitz> yeah
[12:01:22] <arschmitz> so i would be fine either way personally
[12:01:26] <michaelarestad> Yeah.
[12:01:28] <arschmitz> but it seems like more then we need / want
[12:01:47] <arschmitz> like i envisioned only having like 4 breakpoints
[12:01:50] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[12:02:04] <michaelarestad> 3 works pretty well
[12:02:13] <arschmitz> and you could make the whole min-width: 480px
[12:02:14] <michaelarestad> (though technically it ends up being 6)
[12:02:15] <arschmitz> the variable
[12:02:19] <michaelarestad> Right.
[12:02:22] <arschmitz> so you could flip them around how ever you wanted
[12:02:26] <michaelarestad> Another thing to consider
[12:02:34] <michaelarestad> and the reason these mixins are so crazy looking
[12:02:54] <michaelarestad> min-width: 480px and max-width: 480px both apply to something 480px wide.
[12:03:05] <michaelarestad> So we get around it by making one of them 481
[12:03:15] <michaelarestad> The min-width
[12:03:41] <arschmitz> right
[12:03:50] <michaelarestad> Kinda fringy, but can have pretty crazy results when it happens.
[12:04:01] <arschmitz> yeah iv seen it
[12:04:35] <arschmitz> no just for the record
[12:04:48] <arschmitz> we could do equally crazy things solely in the variable system
[12:05:00] <arschmitz> its capable of generating mixins
[12:05:38] <michaelarestad> Sweet.
[12:06:25] <arschmitz> like i said before its just putting the logic in a different place
[12:06:39] <arschmitz> you probably can have a bit more robust logic in js
[12:06:49] <arschmitz> but i doubt we at least need it
[12:36:05] <sfrisk> woah, words
[12:36:14] <sfrisk> this is what happens when I get sucked into work
