[05:52:06] <arschmitz> alexeiTruhin: what can i help you with
[08:08:49] <GreatDanton> sfrisk, what exactly is goal of Styling Components for JS Libraries. The existing components are not good anymore?
[08:09:00] <sfrisk> There no components for Chassis
[08:09:40] <sfrisk> and the goal is to basically take the UI and Mobile UI components that the two frameworks share (among other UI components that we feel are important)
[08:09:50] <sfrisk> and put them all in chassis, so that mobile and ui can share code
[08:10:09] <sfrisk> right now how mobile and UI implement their components from an html/css side of things is VERY different
[08:10:35] <sfrisk> so we're trying to set a sort of standard for the markup and class names of how these components should be implemented
[08:13:47] <GreatDanton> things are bit more clear now
[08:13:50] <GreatDanton> =)
[08:14:00] <sfrisk> :-)
[08:15:08] <sfrisk> a later goal of the project is to have implementation of these components for projects that aren't just jQuery UI and jQuery Mobile
[08:15:14] <sfrisk> but other JS frameworks as well
[08:21:59] <GreatDanton> I noticed some typo in channel. Everywhere I looked, meetings are on tuesday 1pm EST, but here I noticed msg: Mettings are Tuesday 1pm ET
[08:29:15] <sfrisk> ET is another way of saying Eastern Time
[08:29:19] <sfrisk> EST = Eastern Standard Time
