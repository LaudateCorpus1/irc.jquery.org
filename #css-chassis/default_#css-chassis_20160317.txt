[09:57:47] <sfrisk> hey, Akshay, just got your email. As a heads up, if we're not online IRC doesn't send us messages.  If you're interested in participating I suggest coming to the meetings in #jquery-meeting at 2pm ET on Tuesdays, and start to get familiar with the codebase on github
[11:32:42] <nashvail> Hey I left a message a few days ago having Travis CI check done locally before pushing the commit ... any thoughts?
[11:32:50] <nashvail> ago about *
[11:34:01] <sfrisk_> left a message in chat?  Sorry I'm at work today, so unless my username is mentioned, I sometimes don't notice conversations in here
[11:34:30] <geekman-rohit_> Umm travis ci check done locally?
[11:34:37] <geekman-rohit_> We have grunt test for that
[11:35:04] <nashvail> yeah I mean at times after pushing the code, errors like "illegal space  after : " show up
[11:35:10] <geekman-rohit_> Travis simply runs grunt.. so you can just make sure u run it before pushing
[11:35:24] <geekman-rohit_> Run grunt test before committing
[11:35:28] <sfrisk_> 'grunt test'
[11:35:33] <nashvail> Ah! got it
[11:35:38] <sfrisk_> runs the linters and everything you need
[11:35:56] <sfrisk_> Should probably add a note about that to the docs
[11:36:33] <nashvail> I think you should because while I am getting used to the code style, I had to push several trivial fix commits like removing spaces and all
[11:36:44] <nashvail> might be helpful for new contributors to knwo
[11:36:46] <nashvail> know*
[11:39:10] <sfrisk_> I mean you can see the list of grunt tasks you can run in the gruntfile, but I'll make a note to add it to the docs
[11:39:51] <geekman-rohit_> We should add
[11:40:11] <geekman-rohit_> We are just used to grunt.. we know grunt test will run tests for most projects
[11:40:20] <geekman-rohit_> So we often miss this
[15:05:10] <Ak7> Hello Rohit Sir, As you mention in the mail to show off our skill.i'll show you my first demo please check this : http://codepen.io/AK7/pen/QNdQZj
[15:10:13] <geekman-rohit> Hey Ak7
[15:13:48] <geekman-rohit> Good work
[15:13:59] <geekman-rohit> You can submit a draft of ur proposal on the gsoc site
[15:14:22] <geekman-rohit> The sooner you do that .. the soone we can comment and easier for you  to make changes
[15:21:36] <Ak7> sir please see this, this component is my first use of 2D transform.link: http://codepen.io/AK7/pen/EKZQqQ
[15:24:39] <Ak7> yes sir, i'll submit the draft proposal on the gsoc site as soon as possible.
[15:27:05] <Ak7> sir i really want to contribute to this project.now, what further steps would you recommend at this point. thanks
[15:39:53] <Ak7> and this component i used bourbon for animation(mixin for generating clean vendor-prefixed keyframes). link : http://codepen.io/AK7/pen/vGgRLw
[15:40:14] <Ak7> and using scss
