[13:05:03] <sfrisk> Wondering if I should start this meeting
[13:05:15] <sfrisk> or if we should finalize what the new date/time is?
[13:05:56] <sfrisk> http://doodle.com/poll/npw7hx3kd3fke3a4
[13:07:24] <sfrisk> I could keep the doodle open until tomorrow
[13:07:33] <sfrisk> and based on the results of that, declare the new meeting time
[13:08:52] <arthurvr> I filled it in but feel free to ignore my votes if anyone might fall off because of that. I donâ€™t really plan to contribute a bunch of code to chassis and am pretty silent during the meetings anyway.
[13:09:32] <kristyjy> filled it in as well :)
[13:10:21] <sfrisk> At the moment it's looking like Tuesday 2-3pm is the most popular
[13:25:19] <sfrisk> I'll give it to the end of week to see if anyone else has some input
