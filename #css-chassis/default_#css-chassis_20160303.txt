[01:30:09] <thej> sfrisk where can i have a look at my CLA status ?
[08:40:32] <thej> arschmitz is it possible to edit the CLA docs file in which I have incorrectly filled my creds?
[08:41:00] <arschmitz> Yes but what would you want changed?
[08:41:08] <arschmitz> the problem is your git config not your signiture
[08:41:34] <thej> arschmitz I did edit my git config with my full name which I entered in the cla form
[08:41:39] <arschmitz> ok
[08:41:48] <arschmitz> then what would you want changed?
[08:42:18] <thej> pushed a dummy commit, yet getting the cla error
[08:42:32] <arschmitz> did you change your signiture in the old commits?
[08:43:01] <arschmitz> you would have to rebase and amend them or they will still have the old name
[08:43:43] <thej> on it, thanks
[08:44:05] <arschmitz> thej: no problem sorry about the error link not working normally it shows you exactly why its failing
[08:44:28] <arschmitz> we broke that somehow when we added all the dojo foundation projects
[08:44:55] <thej> arschmitz no issues, ah I see
[08:45:57] <thej> squashing all commits and pushing again
[08:53:54] <arschmitz> thej: you applied for GSoC last year also right?
[08:54:00] <arschmitz> if my memory serves
[08:54:17] <thej> arschmitz nope
[08:54:33] <arschmitz> thej: ok sorry :-)
[08:55:08] <thej> arschmitz no problem :)
[09:35:43] <thej> arschmitz tried squashing all my commits into one, yet failing, any other way round ?
[09:36:01] <arschmitz> thej: ill look
[09:36:09] <thej> arschmitz thanks
[09:37:18] <thej> sfrisk_ can I please work on the outline:focus fix ?
[09:37:35] <sfrisk_> Sure, I need to commit buttons (in a work meeting so I can't at the moment)
[09:37:50] <sfrisk_> but you might want to test what you do against the buttons
[09:37:56] <sfrisk_> to make sure it looks okay
[09:38:02] <thej> yes, i will wait for it then
[11:42:12] <geekman-rohit> nashvail there is still time for student applications to start, you can start contributing by looking around for some small tasks or bugs to fix! and participating in discussions
[11:43:31] <nashvail> Forked and going through the codebase. I'll let you know if I run into any issues.
[11:43:41] <sfrisk> Sounds good
[21:37:53] <thej> arschmitz any status on implementing unit tests for sass ?
[21:40:16] <arschmitz> no
[21:40:18] <arschmitz> sadly
[21:40:38] <thej> oh ok
[21:41:07] <arschmitz> if you want to work on it its open for sure
[21:41:34] <thej> yes gladly, i am going through how other frameworks are doing their testing
[21:41:47] <arschmitz> awesome
[21:55:01] <thej> i am getting the following error with perfjankie http://pastebin.com/eDt57YHk , any leads please ?
[22:10:22] <arschmitz> thej: dont use it
[22:10:28] <arschmitz> dont run the perf tests
[22:11:08] <arschmitz> but the error has to do with selenium and or chrome driver not running
