[05:54:56] <nashvail> I  want to work on this issue (https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/75) opened by @sfrisk. A few questions :
[05:54:56] <nashvail> a) While designing am I supposed to use the color scheme in variables>colors.js?
[05:54:56] <nashvail> b) Are there any specific aesthetics to follow?
[07:09:13] <thej> arschmitz had a look at sass testing, couldn't find any popular sass frameworks using them
[07:11:57] <pakhandibaba> Hi
[07:14:04] <pakhandibaba> I am interested in chassis website and components for css framework and js projects
[07:14:11] <pakhandibaba> How can I get started?
[07:19:28] <thej> pakhandibaba Hi. Build css-chassis locally by following the instructions on https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis#getting-started
[07:19:53] <thej> then you can have a look at the issue tracker on https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues and ping mentors here
[07:20:04] <thej> if you face any queries
[07:22:11] <arschmitz> thej: i found the same before
[07:23:19] <thej> arschmitz But I feel we should unit test them now and prep for a larger codebase, thoughts ?
[07:23:33] <arschmitz> thej: yes thats why we opened the issue
[07:24:08] <thej> arschmitz so I will get started on it and maybe everyone else can pool in their views
[07:24:24] <arschmitz> sound sgreat
[09:40:20] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] sfrisk closed pull request #139: Typography: Add Variables (master...typo) https://git.io/v2dcT
[11:22:11] <thej> arschmitz added pure and tried testing basic functions
[11:22:29] <thej> arschmitz could you please look into it and comment
[11:38:13] <thej> sfrisk Can I update the style guide with the changes suggested in the prev meeting ?
[11:38:28] <sfrisk> for JSASS?
[11:38:32] <thej> yes
[11:38:36] <sfrisk> we don't have a JSASS style guide yet
[11:38:46] <thej> sorry, scss
[11:38:58] <sfrisk> add comments to the currently open PR on the SCSS style guide
[11:39:03] <sfrisk> we've been working out of that
[11:39:56] <thej> i checked out into kristyjy's branch and modifying the .md file there
[12:04:24] <sfrisk> sounds good
[12:29:56] <geekman-rohit> nashvail sure
[12:30:10] <geekman-rohit> we prefer you use the sass styles we already follow
[12:30:21] <geekman-rohit> you can go through the following pull requests
[12:31:06] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/138
[12:31:26] <geekman-rohit> would also be good if you use colors from the pallette wherever possible
[13:04:26] <nashvail> Great! Thanks geekman-rohit
[21:57:33] <thej> arschmitz added Pure for unit testing, it doesn't have a grunt plugin
[21:57:52] <arschmitz> thej: can you use it from node?
[21:58:06] <arschmitz> iv looked at it before but honestly dont remember anything about it
[21:58:23] <thej> thej yes, I have written a basic test too
[21:58:34] <thej> using mocha as a test runner
[21:58:43] <thej> its here https://github.com/thejdeep/css-chassis/commit/872925ef66d26de0119b61b9282b63667926f015
[21:59:37] <arschmitz> thej: ill take a look
[21:59:42] <thej> maybe it helps if we can write a grunt plugin for it, will try to implement one over this weekend
[22:00:00] <arschmitz> thej: yeah should be simple
[22:00:15] <thej> arschmitz yeah, must be
[22:00:27] <arschmitz> i write a lot of them feel free to ping me not sure if ill be around over the weekend but if i am im happy to help
[22:00:40] <thej> arschmitz sure, thanks
