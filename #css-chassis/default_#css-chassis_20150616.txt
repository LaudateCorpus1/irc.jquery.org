[06:22:49] <arthurvr> sfrisk: arschmitz: one of you should probably justify the Chassis repo description a bit.
[06:22:53] <arthurvr> itâ€™s empty at the moment

[06:51:35] <arthurvr> sfrisk: Just saw that you edited the description. Thanks. Misses a captial letter ;) Also the description seems useless as the repo is jquery/css-chasiss :p You probably be a little more descriptive about what the project is / wants to be.
[06:52:38] <sfrisk> most of the description is in the readme, but I'll see if I can come up with something else
[06:53:10] <arthurvr> generally itâ€™s one sentence quickly explaining the goal of the project.
[07:02:15] <arschmitz> sfrisk: something like "A high performance css framework for JS libraries"
[07:02:30] <arschmitz> or whatever
[07:02:31] <sfrisk> I can switch to that
[07:03:08] <arschmitz> sfrisk: what you have is fine i thnk
[07:03:12] <sfrisk> TOO LATE
[07:03:15] <arschmitz> i had not seen that you changed it already
[07:03:17] <arschmitz> lol
[07:04:20] <sfrisk> changed it back
[07:18:29] <arthurvr> Neat :)
[09:00:34] <sfrisk> mini gsoc meeting party
[09:00:41] <sfrisk> arschmitz geekman-rohit
[09:01:18] <geekman-rohit> hey
[09:03:26] <sfrisk> Ok, so I'm working on an initial list of variables for you geekman, that will satisfy the requirements for typography
[09:03:29] <geekman-rohit> umm, so this is where we stand, we have agreed upon layout, and tools that we are going to use, and sfrisk is helping me with the wireframe
[09:03:35] <arschmitz> hi
[09:03:52] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, that would be great!
[09:04:47] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, since we agreed upon post, there is no size issue anymore
[09:04:49] <sfrisk> I have it separate right now from jsass-vars at the moment, since my goal this week is to try and push a lot of Chassis stuff forward for jQuerySF next week
[09:05:17] <geekman-rohit> so we go with default json to string and versa or we still use something else?
[09:05:21] <sfrisk> (which is kinda more of a chassis meeting update)
[09:06:44] <geekman-rohit> once we have a single vars file, and a complete wireframe we can hit development at full pace! yay
[09:07:12] <sfrisk> how long do you think we can have jsass-vars up and running, arschmitz?
[09:07:22] <arschmitz> 20 minutes
[09:07:39] <geekman-rohit> :D
[09:08:14] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, I think we can update the readme on the repo with content of my proposal for now?
[09:08:23] <sfrisk> yeah
[09:08:24] <sfrisk> can do
[09:08:29] <sfrisk> quick link to the proposal?
[09:08:36] <geekman-rohit> and a slightly changed timeline, based on what we have decided so far
[09:09:04] <geekman-rohit> abstract and link to a wiki page with a roadmap/timeline in it?
[09:10:38] <sfrisk> yeah
[09:22:58] <sfrisk> so if you have a link to your proposal I can add it to the Readme, or you can submit a PR
[09:25:17] <geekman-rohit> I'll do a PR
