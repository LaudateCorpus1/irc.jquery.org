[03:31:01] <mdhr> Hi, I'd like to contribute to the chassis project. Could someone please help me get started?
[04:20:06] <arschmitz> mdhr: you can start by reading the open issues in the tracker https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues
[04:23:49] <mdhr>  /msg NickServ VERIFY REGISTER mdhr gmkbgahebcos
[04:29:45] <mdhr> arschmitz: I looked through the list, but I can't seem to figure out which one to pick. Could you point me to one that you think would be appropriate for a beginner?
[04:32:41] <arschmitz> mdhr: for the most part there is not much you can actually DO right now
[04:32:55] <arschmitz> mdhr: i would suggest getting involved in some of the discussions
[04:35:04] <mdhr> arschmitz: I was also looking through the GSoC ideas page for chassis. Since I'm interested in applying this year, is there any work from those projects that I could look into?
[04:35:22] <arschmitz> mdhr: its pretty much the same
[04:35:45] <arschmitz> this is a brand new project so there wont be much ready to actually work on before the official start day
[04:35:50] <arschmitz> just to get involved in the planning
[04:39:47] <mdhr> Okay. Thank you.
[09:37:54] <prasunanand> arschmitz, Can we start building the css framework or still some changes need to made ?
[09:39:39] <arschmitz> prasunanand: Building the framework itself is not one of the tasks
[09:39:53] <arschmitz> and is not something that will be done with out a lot of discussion
[09:40:15] <prasunanand> How can I start contributing?
[09:40:31] <arschmitz> prasunanand: my getting involved in the discussions in the issues
[09:41:16] <arschmitz> prasunanand: you could also add another framework to the performance tests
[09:41:25] <arschmitz> or another component
[09:41:26] <prasunanand> sure.
[09:41:40] <prasunanand> what other component?
[09:42:03] <arschmitz> prasunanand: it would be better to start with a framework probably
[09:42:21] <arschmitz> like dojo or kenoui
[09:42:26] <arschmitz> kendoui
[09:43:41] <prasunanand> I also found this link http://usablica.github.io/front-end-frameworks/compare.html  Should we testing all of these frameworks?
[09:44:13] <arschmitz> no thats too many to maintain
[09:44:30] <arschmitz> also some are particular to a certain thing
[09:44:43] <arschmitz> many are officially deprecated
[09:45:43] <prasunanand> I'll be adding semantic-ui and kenoui to just get started :)
[09:46:23] <arschmitz> that sounds good
[09:47:02] <arschmitz> prasunanand: you can see someone elses pr for this here https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/45
[09:47:17] <prasunanand> i saw it; seems easy
[09:48:26] <prasunanand> would we using slush in this project. It makes work easier
[09:50:43] <arschmitz> no
[09:51:20] <arschmitz> we dont use gulp
[09:52:56] <prasunanand> Hmm, ok . Thanks :)
[10:10:03] <hiren_> arschmitz:  I'm very much interested in chassis idea to build demo theme for wordpress and drupal.
[10:10:21] <hiren_> I've set up project on localhost
[10:11:13] <hiren_> Chassis is running on my local server and i've already developed fee webpages using it.
[10:12:07] <hiren_> So, do you want to build theme for wordpress and drupal both or any one of them?
[10:12:41] <hiren_> I' more intersted in wordpress
[10:13:30] <hiren_> Coz I've alreadly developed simple theme using wordpress (without chassis)
[10:13:47] <arschmitz> hiren_: im not sure how you have done that there is nothing to develop a web page with yet
[10:13:54] <arschmitz> chassis has not been made yet
[10:14:02] <hiren_> And have
[10:15:02] <hiren_>  arschmitz just a minute
[10:30:52] <hiren_> arschmitz:  can you open connors.github.io/chassis
[10:33:45] <hiren_> I've downloaded from here and follow given instruction to setup.
[10:43:04] <arschmitz> That is not our repo that is a different project
[10:57:15] <hiren_> arschmitz:  so how is it possible to develop CMS themes before completion of chassis?
[10:57:26] <arschmitz> hiren_: you cant
[11:01:45] <hiren_> arschmitz:  so anyone can submit proposal  for cms theme idea in GSoC 2015?
[11:02:19] <arschmitz> Yes by the time coding starts there will be code for you to work with
[11:08:12] <hiren_> Then what can I do to get familiar with chassis before submission of proposal?
[11:08:48] <hiren_> I've already developed basic wordpress theme.
[11:08:51] <arschmitz> read through the issues and get involved in the discussions there
[11:09:02] <arschmitz> attend the weekly meetings
[11:15:22] <hiren_> Okay thank you arschmitz
[14:53:21] <prasunanand> arschmitz,  I have added the test for semantic-ui buttons but when  I run the test , all the buttons generated are same
[14:53:52] <prasunanand> I have followed the same pattern as in other cases
[15:08:28] <prasunanand> oh sorry , got it :)
[17:20:56] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] prasunanand opened pull request #46: Component: Performance FrameWork Fixes, Added Semantic-UI (master...2-performance-testing) http://git.io/pqnk
[23:27:29] <prasunanand> arschmitz,  I have added the test for semantic- ui buttons. I wanted to know how we select the test cases. I have also made a PR https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/46
