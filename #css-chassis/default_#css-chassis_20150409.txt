[19:26:00] <michaelarestad> Cool.
[19:26:04] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: though it take up to 5 minutes to show the changes ( its on a 5 minute cron )
[19:35:38] <sfrisk> w00t
[19:35:45] <sfrisk> I'm sitting down to work on the colors PR
[19:36:02] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: ill put the table one up too just saw it
[19:36:11] <michaelarestad> Cool. Thanks.
[19:36:15] <sfrisk> @michaelarestad and I brainstormed some ideas, we'll have some pallet colors, and then assign those pallet colors to the default variables
[19:36:33] <michaelarestad> Cool.
[19:36:34] <sfrisk> might keep the pallet file separate from the colors file
[19:36:51] <sfrisk> so it's easy to just dump all the variable names into that file
[19:36:58] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] arschmitz created table (+1 new commit): http://git.io/vebzH
[19:36:58] <chassis-commit> css-chassis/table 509891d Michael Arestad: Build: Initial table styles
[19:37:03] <sfrisk> for your pallet there
[19:37:18] <arschmitz> ok
[19:37:23] <sfrisk> and then tweak the actual colors file on a line by line basis
[19:44:52] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: one thing i notice in the typography now is there is no active state style
[19:45:19] <michaelarestad> There shouldn't be any link styles at this point. (unless it's in a p)
[19:45:38] <michaelarestad> All I want to do is add colors to active, focus, etc.
[19:45:49] <michaelarestad> Which needs the base colors.
[19:46:48] <arschmitz> ok something is weird
[19:46:56] <michaelarestad> Yeah. I was just noticing that.
[19:47:00] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: normally links get a red color when they are active
[19:47:06] <arschmitz> and they are not but i dont see you setting that
[19:47:12] <michaelarestad> Normalize?
[19:47:17] <arschmitz> maybe
[19:47:53] <arschmitz> nope
[19:48:03] <arschmitz> im looking at the full built file so its including that
[19:48:34] <michaelarestad> I don't know if the typography branch is right
[19:48:36] <michaelarestad> http://view.css-chassis.com/table/demos/typography.html
[19:48:39] <michaelarestad> ^ has the red
[19:49:04] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: are you getting the outline if you tab?
[19:49:32] <michaelarestad> Only on the table branch preview
[19:49:39] <michaelarestad> and locally on the typography branch
[19:51:57] <arschmitz> yeah im looking local for typography
[19:52:06] <arschmitz> last i checked the css file was being cached still
[19:52:28] <arschmitz> ( i need to make sure this is not behind cloud flare i think i may have given the ok to move it there which was not smart if i did )
[19:53:29] <michaelarestad> Cleared local cache. thinking it's a bit more sticky than that
[19:53:38] <michaelarestad> Cloudflare cache sounds right
[19:53:55] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: yeah i run generally with my local cache disabled so i know its not that
[19:54:04] <arschmitz> but we do use cloudflare for most htings
[19:54:20] <arschmitz> and i vaguely remember giving the ok to put view behind it
[19:54:24] <michaelarestad> lol
[19:54:48] <arschmitz> ill check on it probably next week im gone for the weekend
[19:55:03] <michaelarestad> No worries. Later!
[20:02:52] <michaelarestad> Alrighty, I'm out. Later!
[20:03:00] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: later
