[05:31:07] <aspirar_> Hello, I was looking at the gsoc ideas page and came across projects related to chassis. However, I could not find much information about it on GitHub. Could someone point me to resources, and how to contribute to it?

[08:05:11] <sfrisk> scott_gonzalez, can you repeat that, it's not it my feed

[08:05:34] <arschmitz> but they are gone now
[08:05:44] <arschmitz> it was aspirar_
[08:06:15] <scott_gonzalez> Might want to have something written up, at least some contact info, not sure what's included in the GSoC info they're looking at (cc jzaefferer)
[08:06:19] <sfrisk> We should probably add a note to the chatroom information to go look at the issues
[08:06:59] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: i think they might just be getting it from https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2015---Ideas-List
[08:07:10] <scott_gonzalez> ah
[08:07:26] <arschmitz> because the application i don't think has even been submitted yet
[08:08:27] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: so its kinda premature at this point i think but maybe we should put something in that wiki about it
[08:08:47] <sfrisk> Editing it now
[08:10:49] <sfrisk> going to link to the issues page instead of the code
[08:13:52] <sfrisk> bah, I don't have permission to update
[08:15:49] <scott_gonzalez> sfrisk: Yeah, see the discussion in #jquery-dev :-)
