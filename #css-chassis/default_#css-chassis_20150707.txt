[09:01:24] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit, arschmitz, arthurvr --- fun party gsoc time!
[09:01:35] <arthurvr> hey
[09:01:44] <geekman-rohit> hey
[09:01:48] <sfrisk> hope everyone is doing well today
[09:02:02] <geekman-rohit> arthurvr our main agenda today is your suggestions on the PR :)
[09:02:13] <arthurvr> alright :p
[09:02:21] <sfrisk> Figured it was best to bring some of the stuff you were talking about
[09:02:22] <sfrisk> up here
[09:02:33] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.css-chassis.com/pull/8#discussion_r34021124
[09:02:52] <sfrisk> also, on that note, jzaefferer, if you want input on this conversation, we're discussing gsoc themeroller stuff
[09:04:24] <geekman-rohit> ping arschmitz
[09:05:25] <arthurvr> geekman-rohit: what‚Äôs up with that comment?
[09:06:00] <geekman-rohit> umm comment ?
[09:06:26] <sfrisk> I think geekman was referring to the whole PR
[09:06:46] <arthurvr> well you linked up one comment (notice the url) :p
[09:07:00] <geekman-rohit> yep, the whole PR, basically should we test on nodejs 0.12 too on travis
[09:07:14] <jzaefferer> oh hai
[09:07:16] <geekman-rohit> I mean especially that point
[09:07:18] <geekman-rohit> hey!
[09:07:25] <arthurvr> well I don‚Äôt see why not we might as well be future-proof
[09:07:28] <sfrisk> I know there are reasons why we haven't switched from nodejs 0.10
[09:08:08] <jzaefferer> are there?
[09:08:14] <sfrisk> I thought there were
[09:08:33] <arthurvr> I think the reason was just it works so why bother changing it
[09:08:34] <sfrisk> I seem to recall a discussion about it when someone suggested moving chassis to 12
[09:08:46] <sfrisk> let me see if I can find the discussion
[09:08:49] <sfrisk> I remember it got grumpy
[09:09:12] <arthurvr> oh I do remember
[09:09:23] <arthurvr> because libsass didn‚Äôt use to support 0.12
[09:09:27] <arthurvr> IIRC that was the reason
[09:09:50] <sfrisk> ahhh
[09:09:59] <sfrisk> that sounds right
[09:10:04] <arthurvr> which doesn‚Äôt matter for themeroller
[09:10:17] <geekman-rohit> umm it does actually
[09:10:26] <arthurvr> why? libsass is fixed these days?
[09:10:43] <geekman-rohit> does it already support 0.12 ?
[09:10:53] <sfrisk> Checking now
[09:10:57] <arthurvr> I don‚Äôt know what version chassis is on but the latest libsass supports it
[09:12:14] <sfrisk> I remember arschmitz was the one who did a lot of that initial configuration
[09:12:26] <arschmitz> hey sorry
[09:12:38] <geekman-rohit> and themeroller will depend on chassis
[09:12:50] <geekman-rohit> in future, if I am not wrong
[09:13:01] <geekman-rohit> so what version of node chassis supports also matters
[09:14:05] <arthurvr> we just need to bump grunt-sass in the chassis repo
[09:14:09] <arthurvr> to ^1.0.0
[09:14:10] <arschmitz> so chassis it self should support as much as we can
[09:14:16] <arschmitz> as far as node versions
[09:14:19] <arthurvr> https://github.com/sindresorhus/grunt-sass/releases/tag/v1.0.0
[09:14:21] <arschmitz> within reason
[09:14:50] <arschmitz> so it should be tested on both .10 and .12
[09:14:57] <arthurvr> yeah sure it should
[09:15:08] <sfrisk> when is the plan to switch stuff to .12?
[09:15:15] <arschmitz> there is not one currently
[09:15:24] <arthurvr> as quick as possible I‚Äôd say
[09:15:46] <arschmitz> Bumping the node version on all the servers requires a lot of testing
[09:15:53] <geekman-rohit> themeroller straight away I guess, I need that PR to land soon so Im gonna update it straightaway
[09:16:01] <arschmitz> thats its not likely anyone has time to deal with right now
[09:16:02] <jzaefferer> why do all severs have to run the same node version?
[09:16:07] <jzaefferer> *servers
[09:16:22] <arschmitz> they dont but we do to make it easier to manage
[09:16:23] <geekman-rohit> exactly my query
[09:16:29] <arschmitz> because stuff gets moved around
[09:16:31] <jzaefferer> Even so, we should run CI with both 0.10 and 0.12
[09:16:37] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yes we should
[09:16:38] <arthurvr> sure
[09:16:41] <geekman-rohit> sure
[09:17:04] <geekman-rohit> my only concern was since we will depend on chassis too
[09:17:13] <geekman-rohit> what chassis supports will also matter
[09:17:20] <arthurvr> we should just open an issue to bump all chassis deps
[09:17:20] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: chassis should be testing and supporting both
[09:17:38] <arschmitz> it just has not been updated i dont think .12 was even out when i set this repo up
[09:17:42] <geekman-rohit> nice
[09:17:55] <sfrisk> I can create an issue to bump dependencies
[09:18:00] <arthurvr> :+1:
[09:18:16] <geekman-rohit> thats cool :)
[09:18:20] <arthurvr> next up?
[09:18:21] <geekman-rohit> and Ill update the PR
[09:18:49] <geekman-rohit> container based infra. I agree, I didnt know about it
[09:18:57] <geekman-rohit> on your suggestion I read and agree
[09:19:12] <arthurvr> yeah I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs much doubt about that
[09:19:16] <arschmitz> because we are talking about having chassis have its own node api its really really important we support different versions
[09:19:39] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz +1
[09:21:42] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] sfrisk opened issue #95: Update Chassis to support node 0.12 http://git.io/vqERj
[09:22:34] <geekman-rohit> jscs startup, well I missed that, and I think I should remove it from both since the folder doesnt exist as of now
[09:22:41] <geekman-rohit> we will add as we go
[09:23:28] <arthurvr> Why are we spending time going over almost every review comment? Most of them don‚Äôt really need much discussion :p
[09:23:57] <geekman-rohit> yep, we are not going to, only ones I though need to be discussed
[09:24:17] <geekman-rohit> and only one left is jscs quotemark : double
[09:25:55] <sfrisk> I think that was more of a discussion for contribute and the style guides there?
[09:26:28] <geekman-rohit> yes so I'll let it be as it is till then
[09:27:03] <arthurvr> sfrisk: not really as the styleguide doesn‚Äôt talk about JSCS.
[09:27:10] <sfrisk> true
[09:27:33] <arschmitz> i think we should leave it in the jshint
[09:27:41] <arthurvr> why?
[09:27:41] <sfrisk> but the quotemark: double is in the linting guide for jshintrc
[09:27:48] <arschmitz> since we say we follow the styleguie and the style guide lists that rule
[09:28:03] <arschmitz> and it does not hurt to do it twice
[09:28:03] <sfrisk> https://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/
[09:28:05] <arthurvr> sfrisk: well if you don‚Äôt use JSCS that makes sense, but we do :p
[09:28:20] <arthurvr> it‚Äôs not big deal, but we‚Äôre checking that and some other things twice now
[09:28:28] <arthurvr> JSHint is slow enough :p
[09:28:49] <arschmitz> arthurvr: i highly doubt that one rule will make a noticeable difference
[09:29:29] <arthurvr> arschmitz: Dunno, as I said it‚Äôs no big. leave it at this for now then
[09:30:08] <geekman-rohit> cool then :) arthurvr I brought the comments up merely to take arschmitzs inputs on it
[09:30:29] <geekman-rohit> I think that solves my concerns :) I'll update the PR in some time
[09:30:39] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.css-chassis.com/pull/8#discussion_r34020987
[09:30:53] <arthurvr> do we really need the overhead of load-grunt-config?
[09:31:10] <arthurvr> I mean our gruntfile is 30 lines :p
[09:31:33] <arschmitz> arthurvr: i expect it will grow considderibly
[09:31:43] <geekman-rohit> what arschmitz said, yes
[09:31:56] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: i would leave it up to you to use for the case knowing how you plan to structure thing
[09:32:09] <arthurvr> Even if it grows I don‚Äôt see a problem with it being big :p
[09:32:12] <arschmitz> but if you expect it to get very big i think its worth using load-grunt-config
[09:32:19] <arthurvr> define ‚Äùbig‚Äù
[09:32:23] <sfrisk> We can always change it in the future
[09:32:36] <geekman-rohit> yep and I need that PR merged as soon as possible
[09:32:42] <geekman-rohit> so I agree with sfrsik
[09:32:45] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk*
[09:32:55] <sfrisk> haha, arschmitz has the power too :-p
[09:33:13] <geekman-rohit> no I mean I will have to read about it, so better later
[09:33:17] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: i think you should use one or the other but i would leave it up to you what you think is best
[09:33:18] <geekman-rohit> so we dont keep the PR waiting
[09:33:44] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, if its okay I would like to read about it and make the change later, once this merges, I have 2 more PRs to start
[09:33:59] <sfrisk> well if everyone is happy with the PR, I can pull it in, probably this afternoon - this computer hasn't been set up with jQuery projects yet
[09:34:39] <arthurvr> well those few things I commented and for the rest a big :+1: of mine
[09:35:23] <geekman-rohit> another thing, arshcmitz about adding files to jscs / css lint
[09:35:59] <geekman-rohit> will **.js / **.css work for us?
[09:36:25] <arschmitz> no you need to exclude external things
[09:36:25] <geekman-rohit> I think it would check 3rd party files too?
[09:37:04] <arschmitz> yes
[09:37:07] <arschmitz> see my comment i just put
[09:37:08] <geekman-rohit> so we just add our folders, the way I plan it there should be 3 paths needed, I add them now or as we go
[09:38:06] <geekman-rohit> yep
[09:38:28] <geekman-rohit> that was all on my list, except yeah, do we need to setup checking CLA?
[09:38:46] <geekman-rohit> I remember all jquery projects do that
[09:39:08] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: yes thats done with github settings though
[09:39:28] <arschmitz> im guessing it has to be done by scott_gonzalez
[09:39:51] <geekman-rohit> oh cool
[09:40:42] <geekman-rohit> that is all, unless there is anything anyone thinks I missed?
[09:41:01] <sfrisk> I don't think so
[09:41:10] <sfrisk> Can anyone else think of anything?
[09:43:17] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz geekman-rohit: Is the CLA check not running?
[09:43:29] <scott_gonzalez> I see tags on all the PRs.
[09:43:50] <arthurvr> scott_gonzalez: I don‚Äôt see any labels
[09:43:50] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, is this for the download builder repo?
[09:43:53] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: themeroller.css-chassis.com
[09:44:00] <geekman-rohit> scott_gonzalez, for themeroller.css-chassis.com
[09:44:06] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.css-chassis.com/pulls
[09:44:07] <scott_gonzalez> Ah, one sec, I'll add it.
[09:44:28] <scott_gonzalez> For future reference, it's just a web hook, so anyone with admin on the repo can set it up.
[09:44:43] <sfrisk> Okay, awesome, thanks
[09:44:54] <geekman-rohit> great! thanks
[09:46:05] <scott_gonzalez> geekman-rohit: If you push an updated to PR #6, we can see if it's working now.
[09:47:11] <geekman-rohit> i'll be doing that in like an hour?
[09:47:26] <geekman-rohit> I'll ping you if it doesnt work, scott_gonzalez
[09:47:33] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:47:40] <geekman-rohit> cool :) thanks
[09:50:47] <geekman-rohit> thanks for your time everyone :)
[09:50:58] <sfrisk> no problem
[10:03:38] <sfrisk> Meeting time in #jquery-meeting everyone!
