[08:33:53] <sfrisk> @arschmitz, geekman-rohit - mini gsoc party time
[08:34:16] <geekman-rohit> yay
[08:34:32] <sfrisk> okay
[08:34:42] <sfrisk> having this a little early, since I have a company function at noon EST
[08:35:49] <arthurvr> hey hey Iâ€™m here too today
[08:35:56] <arthurvr> hey everybody
[08:36:00] <geekman-rohit> hey!
[08:36:14] <sfrisk> hey arthurvr!
[08:36:23] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/geekman-rohit/themeroller-demo
[08:36:29] <arschmitz> hi
[08:36:39] <geekman-rohit> arthurvr thats the proof of concept app we made in first two weeks
[08:37:01] <geekman-rohit> it achieves things in not so good ways and is tiny
[08:37:21] <geekman-rohit> but a review about technologies used would be great
[08:37:34] <geekman-rohit> libraries used i mean*
[08:37:44] <sfrisk> Looking through it now
[08:37:52] <arthurvr> let me try this out
[08:38:45] <arthurvr> why is something like setup.js needed?
[08:39:19] <arthurvr> we might as well just put that kind of information in a json file instead of having to input it right?
[08:39:23] <geekman-rohit> well simply so its easier to setup on server
[08:39:25] <geekman-rohit> yep
[08:39:29] <geekman-rohit> true that
[08:39:43] <geekman-rohit> thats what the script does anyways
[08:40:06] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz thinks it is not needed too
[08:40:14] <arschmitz> indeed
[08:40:22] <sfrisk> working on setting this up locally so I can look at it closer
[08:44:03] <sfrisk> hrmm, getting an error with the SQL syntax when using the setup.js
[08:45:00] <geekman-rohit> okay thats new, I installed it both on my laptop and pc again after commit
[08:45:45] <arthurvr> by the way we should probably start good from the beginning and write tests for all of this too
[08:46:02] <sfrisk> goot point, arthurvr
[08:46:32] <sfrisk> that being said, I like the interface
[08:46:32] <geekman-rohit> yep, I spent barely afew days on that app
[08:46:47] <sfrisk> might not want to use the default color input, because that won't necessarily work in all browsers
[08:46:56] <arthurvr> yeah I get that geekman-rohit just brainstorming :)
[08:47:27] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, yep, you have any specific in mind.. ?
[08:47:59] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.css-chassis.com/issues/5
[08:48:10] <arthurvr> http://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/ is pretty cool
[08:48:57] <arthurvr> itâ€™s the one in chrome devtools for the ones that donâ€™t know spectrum
[08:50:04] <sfrisk> the one you suggested geekman isn't too bad: http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/
[08:50:11] <sfrisk> and allows for rgb, hex, and hsb
[08:50:25] <arthurvr> hmm yeah that looks good actually
[08:50:26] <sfrisk> which if you have people making a theme off of a photoshop file, it will make things easier for them
[08:50:58] <geekman-rohit> yep and I removed it from demo app, coz it didnt do well with jquery mobile
[08:51:05] <geekman-rohit> but then i removed jquery mobile too
[08:51:13] <geekman-rohit> and never put thisback :D
[08:51:28] <arschmitz> i dont think you need or want jquery mobile
[08:51:40] <arthurvr> ^ me neighter
[08:51:44] <geekman-rohit> yes, agreed
[08:53:48] <geekman-rohit> jquery-color-picker then ?
[08:53:56] <sfrisk> I think so
[08:54:03] <arthurvr> sounds good
[08:54:33] <geekman-rohit> theres another issue about database schema
[08:54:42] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.css-chassis.com/issues/7
[08:54:54] <sfrisk> Looking at it now
[08:55:26] <sfrisk> "data" I assume is the variable info?
[08:55:41] <geekman-rohit> yes, all of it
[08:55:49] <geekman-rohit> encoded into a string
[08:55:59] <arthurvr> not sure about the version thing adam mentioned but the rest looks quite okay :)
[08:56:07] <geekman-rohit> maybe using JSON.stringify
[08:56:41] <geekman-rohit> well arthurvr, he does have a point
[08:56:44] <sfrisk> do we want blob vs txt?
[08:56:48] <geekman-rohit> suppose we have a new version?
[08:56:49] <sfrisk> text*
[08:57:09] <geekman-rohit> I don't mind either? any opinions?
[08:57:28] <sfrisk> or maybe LONGTEXT
[08:57:33] <geekman-rohit> in case of a newer version,we might want to differentiate the themes somehow
[08:57:49] <geekman-rohit> LONGTEXT certainly, yes!
[08:58:15] <sfrisk> just because there could definitely be a lot of variables
[08:58:44] <geekman-rohit> yep
[08:58:55] <sfrisk> also I noticed you have a created vs updated timestamp
[08:59:02] <sfrisk> can anyone update a theme? Or only the creator?
[08:59:21] <geekman-rohit> currently anyone with a link
[08:59:31] <geekman-rohit> how do we identify thecreator
[08:59:37] <geekman-rohit> then we need login :P
[08:59:41] <arschmitz> i would say you should never update a theme
[08:59:50] <arschmitz> it should always create a new one
[08:59:58] <geekman-rohit> sounds good to me
[09:00:05] <arthurvr> what arschmitz said
[09:00:28] <sfrisk> So theme is saved when you hit 'save theme'
[09:00:32] <sfrisk> or share theme
[09:00:33] <arschmitz> and only save for like 30 days
[09:00:33] <sfrisk> or whatever
[09:00:50] <sfrisk> 30 days limit is good, although what if a theme is popular?
[09:00:59] <geekman-rohit> we could have 90 days
[09:01:06] <geekman-rohit> i guess mysql can handle
[09:01:11] <arschmitz> there should also be a file in the download
[09:01:20] <arschmitz> so you can upload your old theme to adjust it
[09:01:24] <arschmitz> past the cut off
[09:01:49] <sfrisk> I think boostrap has something similar - that you can upload an old json file
[09:01:56] <arschmitz> the jquery mobile theme roller does too
[09:01:59] <sfrisk> okay, work partay of pizza is starting
[09:02:04] <arschmitz> you can paste in the old one
[09:02:12] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[09:02:13] <arschmitz> and it parses the variables out
[09:02:14] <geekman-rohit> yes
[09:02:15] <sfrisk> continue on without me! Update the issue with any decisions you come up with
[09:02:22] <arschmitz> i actually need to run too
[09:02:24] <arschmitz> lunch also
[09:02:35] <geekman-rohit> blob vs text vs longtext
[09:02:37] <arthurvr> well then we may as well call this one finished :)
[09:02:52] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: im not a big DB guy
[09:02:59] <geekman-rohit> if everyone can give opinion later, on the issue
[09:03:02] <arschmitz> ask aulvi from that issue
[09:03:04] <arthurvr> maybe open an issue about testing too?
[09:03:07] <arschmitz> hes better
[09:03:30] <geekman-rohit> testing as in.. unit testing?
[09:03:33] <geekman-rohit> linting?
[09:03:36] <arschmitz> you can find him in #jquery-infrastructure
[09:03:44] <arschmitz> s5fs
[09:03:45] <arthurvr> both the the first one is more important :)
[09:05:09] <arthurvr> preferably running in CI but thatâ€™s a detail
[09:05:17] <geekman-rohit> um,Ill start a issue
[09:05:39] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/geekman-rohit/themeroller.css-chassis.com/tree/setup
[09:06:02] <geekman-rohit> I got some basic environment there, arthurvr
[09:06:27] <arthurvr> yeah linting but not tests for the backend right
[09:06:46] <geekman-rohit> yeah
[09:08:14] <arthurvr> anyways I think we can call this one finished then?
[09:08:42] <geekman-rohit> sure.. thanks for your time everyone!
[09:09:50] <arthurvr> nice work geekman-rohit !
[09:11:53] <geekman-rohit> thank you, I am worried its going slow, so putting in double time from this week :)
