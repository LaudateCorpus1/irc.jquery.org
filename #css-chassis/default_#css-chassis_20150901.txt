[08:54:48] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: do you know of a decent (CSS) technique to have an element will the available vertical space? I've got a header of a somewhat fixed size and want the element below to take up the rest of the page, but not go any larger
[08:55:16] <arschmitz> whats your browser support?
[08:56:18] <jzaefferer> "modern"
[08:57:08] <jzaefferer> looking around stackoverflow I'm getting the impression that I should use flexbox...
[09:03:56] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: its one option
[09:04:28] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: when you say somewhat fixed is it fixed or not lol?
[09:04:33] <arschmitz> if it is there are more options
[09:05:43] <jzaefferer> Currently it has a fixed size
[09:06:36] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: so you could do something like setting the lower one to position absolute top0 left0 right0 bottom0
[09:06:45] <arschmitz> and give it top padding the size of your header
[09:07:05] <arschmitz> and position your header absolute above it at top0 left0

[09:12:56] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: thanks. How can I get the pre to not overflow its container? http://jsbin.com/hoyipusoze/1/edit?html,css,output
[09:13:53] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: not following what did you do besides delete the word content?
[09:14:34] <arschmitz> and what do you mean overflow im not seeing any scrolling?
[09:15:29] <jzaefferer> this might work: http://jsbin.com/hoyipusoze/1/edit?html,css,output
[09:15:49] <arschmitz> ok
[09:16:07] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: did you change something i dont see any changes besides a deleted word?
[09:16:23] <jzaefferer> no gray box?
[09:16:34] <arschmitz> gray box?
[09:16:58] <jzaefferer> now? http://jsbin.com/tokuzupiga/1/edit?html,css,output
[09:17:13] <arschmitz> that i see a gray box
[09:17:25] <jzaefferer> and it scrolls?
[09:17:29] <arschmitz> yes
[09:17:53] <arschmitz> is that what you want?
[09:37:10] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: yes, that should work. Will see how it goes when actually integrated into the app
