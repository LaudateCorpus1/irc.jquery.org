[06:30:21] <Adil> Good evening, I'm very interested taking part in jQuery developing
[06:30:43] <Adil> what exactly expected from me in the proposal?
[07:06:22] <Adil> have anyone answered my question? I was off
[07:07:44] <trailofdad> first you need to choose a project to work on
[07:08:29] <trailofdad> I would go read through all the github issues and the reccommended projects for chassis
[07:10:54] <Adil> I chose chassis
[07:13:32] <geekman-rohit> Adil: yes but what about chassis
[07:13:36] <Adil> I want create a pattern library
[07:14:04] <Adil> I have experience in HTML, CSS and JS
[07:14:51] <geekman-rohit> you can ping here in a while, someone from the chassis team may be online then
[07:15:28] <geekman-rohit> or go through the channel logs at irc.jquery.org
[07:16:00] <geekman-rohit> you will find some guidance, look for the log of last chassis meeting ( 19 march )
[07:16:30] <geekman-rohit> 17 march, sorry :P
[07:16:53] <Adil> how could I?
[07:17:00] <Adil> through IRC or browser?
[07:17:10] <geekman-rohit> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery-meeting/default_%23jquery-meeting_20150317.log.html
[07:17:14] <Adil> oh i See
[07:17:17] <Adil> thanks)
[07:17:18] <geekman-rohit> visit this via your browser
[07:17:18] <trailofdad> also, do some research on writing a proposal if you are wondering HOW you are going to write it
[07:21:05] <Adil> okay
[07:24:26] <trailofdad> Adil, I have seen a lot of people interested in doing the pattern library. perhaps you should also look at CMS themes as well
[07:25:38] <trailofdad> anyone know what happens with duplicate proposals?
[07:29:02] <trailofdad> I had read something about it in the timeline
[07:40:54] <slayslot> Guys, how much time should npm install take on the root directory?
[07:50:56] <geekman-rohit> trailofdad it depends on the org
[07:51:11] <geekman-rohit> they may go for 2 proposals for some project
[07:51:40] <geekman-rohit> and the duplicates in timeline was about duplicate students (2 or more orgs choosing same student)
[07:52:29] <geekman-rohit> slayslot npm isntall on the css-chassis repo?
[07:52:40] <geekman-rohit> really, it depends on your bandwidth
[07:54:09] <geekman-rohit> slayslot_ what was the last msg you got?
[07:54:30] <slayslot_> geekman-rohit, I have an 1mbps connection
[07:54:38] <geekman-rohit> which OS?
[07:54:44] <slayslot_> windows 8.1
[07:55:03] <geekman-rohit> oopsie npm install doesnt show logs in windows by default :P
[07:55:45] <slayslot_> I was going to try in ubuntu, but well my ubuntu got messed up. Will have to reinstall.
[07:56:28] <geekman-rohit> should work fine in windows 8
[07:57:06] <slayslot> I'm sorry about the Disconnects
[07:57:14] <geekman-rohit> i have a 6mbps connection and still had to wait a while on win 7, esp because it doesnt show anything on the console
[07:58:02] <slayslot> that is not the problem with linux?
[07:58:03] <geekman-rohit> do npm install when your internet is stable, and wait till you see a success message or error message :)
[08:03:44] <geekman-rohit> slayslot, no in linux terminal npm install shows module wise log
[08:04:55] <Adil> Are there any proposals that have been accepted last years?
[08:06:22] <geekman-rohit> Adil, jquery Foundation didn't participate in GSOC 2014
[08:07:21] <slayslot> Thank you for your help geekman-rohit. I think so I'll reinstall ubuntu and try there.
[08:07:24] <Adil> aa okay)
[08:08:34] <geekman-rohit> slayslot, try once more on widows, and wait for the process to end, if you get no msg, then its still running, any error will be shown :)
[08:09:15] <Adil> other organizations just submitted samples with questions to fill out, but I didn't find any of jQuery((
[08:09:42] <slayslot> actually, I also get some warnings while npm install.
[08:10:13] <geekman-rohit> slayslot, make a gist and share the warnings? WArning is okay, Error is not :)
[08:10:31] <geekman-rohit> Adil, there is a proposal format link available on the ideas page
[08:11:27] <slayslot> okay
[08:11:33] <slayslot> Let me build again
[08:11:58] <geekman-rohit> delete the node_modules directory and start again
[08:11:58] <Adil> wow really I missed this part of the page)
[08:12:10] <Adil> thanks, geekman-rohit
[08:12:19] <slayslot> shall I also delete the cache?
[08:12:47] <geekman-rohit> slayslot, do that will be a clean start
[08:13:08] <geekman-rohit> no problem, Adil
[08:13:13] <slayslot> alright
[08:14:43] <slayslot> this might take a while.
[08:30:27] <slayslot> npm WARN engine xmlbuilder@2.3.0: wanted: {"node":"0.8.x || 0.10.x || 0.11.x"} (current: {"node":"0.12.0","npm":"2.5.1"} )
[08:30:30] <slayslot> so far I
[08:30:39] <slayslot> I've got this warning
[08:31:06] <geekman-rohit> you need node version 0.11
[08:31:14] <geekman-rohit> you have 0.12.x
[08:31:52] <geekman-rohit> https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/59
[08:32:11] <geekman-rohit> theres already that PR to fix this, but it has not been merged yet.
[08:32:52] <slayslot> so I should downgrade?
[08:33:25] <geekman-rohit> yes, or you can go throught that PR and see what alexeiTruhin did
[08:34:59] <geekman-rohit> slayslot? is the process still running?
[08:35:23] <slayslot> yes
[08:35:58] <geekman-rohit> if you are planning to do perf testing, the warning wont affect anhthing
[08:36:39] <slayslot> then, I'll just let it continue
[08:37:39] <geekman-rohit> you will get a grunt-sass build failes error in the end
[08:38:17] <trailofdad> sfirsk, you're from Portland? I'm originally from Saint John, NB... not all that far
[08:38:32] <geekman-rohit> continue to next commands grunt build and then grunt perf, performance testing will work fine. Downgrade Node.js later :)
[08:39:24] <sfrisk> indeed I am
[08:39:46] <sfrisk> well actually I'm from further north in maine
[08:40:00] <sfrisk> but not much of a tech scene there
[08:40:02] <slayslot> alright, can you tell me the approx time it took your connection to complete the process? So that I know how much time I've to be without much of online activity? :P
[08:40:24] <trailofdad> I'm planning a trip to maine this summer actually. Going to hike Kathadin
[08:40:34] <trailofdad> or fall actually
[08:40:38] <trailofdad> better temps
[08:41:24] <trailofdad> Katahdin*
[08:42:08] <sfrisk> Kathadin is very pretty
[08:42:13] <sfrisk> I used to go there a lot in the summer
[08:42:23] <geekman-rohit> slayslot  around 5 mins
[08:44:41] <slayslot> Then I'm pretty sure there's something wrong. Because the last time I ran the process, I let it run for about 2 hours but there was no progess.
[08:45:48] <slayslot> I'll let this be my last try on windows. Let it run for another hour, if there's no progress I'll move to linux.
[08:46:41] <geekman-rohit> nope slayslot
[08:46:45] <geekman-rohit> 2 hours is too much!
[08:47:00] <geekman-rohit> just movie to linix straightaway :)
[08:47:32] <slayslot> alright, I'll get on with it.
[08:47:56] <slayslot> Thank you for your help geekman-rohit. Much appreciated :)
[08:53:00] <geekman-rohit> slayslot, we have tested it on windows/ linux/ OSX, I still think its problem with your internet connection :P
[08:58:04] <slayslot> Maybe.
[08:58:17] <slayslot> Atleast on linux I'll know what the problem is.
[08:58:45] <geekman-rohit> yep, and on ubuntu make sure you start with a downgraded Node.js
[08:59:27] <slayslot> yes
[08:59:51] <trailofdad> geekman do you run ubuntu on your machine or in a VM
[09:00:25] <geekman-rohit> trailofdad, I run open suse on pc and fedora on laptop, no Ubuntu
[09:00:39] <trailofdad> ahh cool
[09:01:25] <trailofdad> I've got an arch build on the go with no gui yet :D
[09:02:01] <geekman-rohit> that is super cool :D
[09:02:02] <trailofdad> having an issue with starting gnome... I think its the gdm
[09:02:37] <geekman-rohit> I never tried hands on arch yet
[09:03:23] <trailofdad> It can be a pain the first few times through. I had an awesome build about 4 years ago... havent touched it since so now I'm really having trouble
[09:03:45] <geekman-rohit> have you installed xserver?
[09:03:55] <trailofdad> I can start X
[09:04:26] <trailofdad> just not with gnome
[09:05:10] <trailofdad> I spent a whole night on it then got frustrated... i'll eventually get back to fixing it
