[01:50:51] <nashvail> The code style check (Travis CI) is performed after commit is pushed, shouldn't it be performed in the local environment? Before pushing the commit?
[09:23:10] <thej> sfrisk: today's meeting is at 12 PM ET ?
[09:23:21] <sfrisk> 2pm ET
[09:23:49] <thej> Ok. Thanks.
[14:55:47] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: kristyjy sfrisk please ping me if you have ideas for any other helpers you would like to see jsass expose
[14:56:04] <arschmitz> map resolution is a good one
[14:56:21] <geekman-rohit> yep!
[14:56:26] <all3fox> yep
[14:56:30] <sfrisk> Will do
[14:56:41] <geekman-rohit> all3fox you can go over issues
[14:56:47] <nashvail> so while the GSOC period does the student get to continue working on current issues and PRs or as the project idea mentions work on brand new components with JS and all the good stuff üòÉ
[14:56:48] <geekman-rohit> and see if there is any task you like
[14:57:06] <geekman-rohit> nashvail that is for you to decide
[14:57:08] <all3fox> Basically, I did some easy commits to jQuery Core this months but they do not have any GSoC mentors. Or it looks like it (mgol is thinking)
[14:57:16] <geekman-rohit> you have to complete your project
[14:57:21] <geekman-rohit> as in your proposal
[14:57:29] <geekman-rohit> but you should also help around with other development
[14:57:34] <geekman-rohit> sometimes
[14:57:43] <nashvail> hmm makes sense.
[14:58:06] <nashvail> One more question. What exactly do mentors look for in a proposal? Is it treated same like going through a resume?
[14:58:08] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit definitely helped out with things that weren't under his proposal over the summer
[14:58:25] <sfrisk> but it is expected your focus is on your proposal topic
[14:58:27] <geekman-rohit> nashvail you can go through last years proposals
[14:58:30] <geekman-rohit> let me find mine
[14:58:33] <all3fox> geekman-rohit: ok, thx, no more questions, will make time this Friday-Sunday and will see what I can do for a PR
[14:58:38] <nashvail> I already have yours saved
[14:58:46] <nashvail> geekman-rohit: in google docs
[14:58:59] <sfrisk> I think our page links to a tutorial template in sympy we liked
[14:59:01] <sfrisk> let me find it
[14:59:04] <geekman-rohit> all3fox if you need help ping me up
[14:59:04] <thej> geekman-rohit: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tKXT5_dDL6P9WHbmChu368pyyty8BV4nNQ4tFvoCcFI/edit
[14:59:27] <sfrisk> https://github.com/sympy/sympy/wiki/gsoc-2014-application-template#writing-your-proposal
[14:59:45] <sfrisk> (It should be noted, don't submit a patch to sympy, submit a PR to our project)
[14:59:52] <geekman-rohit> lol
[15:00:05] <nashvail> that's what confused me the patch requirement thing
[15:00:39] <sfrisk> Yeah, we've had a few messages about it
[15:00:51] <geekman-rohit> i was amused
[15:00:56] <sfrisk> basically, submit code to the project you want to work for
[15:01:04] <sfrisk> so we can get a feel for your coding style and everything
[15:01:18] <geekman-rohit> and add your works to the proposal
[15:01:19] <geekman-rohit> show off
[15:01:21] <thej> could we get the draft proposal reviewed by you guys before submitting it officially ?
[15:01:31] <geekman-rohit> add links to ur PRs and other projects u worked on
[15:01:57] <geekman-rohit> you can submit it officially as a draft
[15:02:12] <sfrisk> we can comment on the proposal and you can keep updating it throughout the process
[15:02:12] <all3fox> geekman-rohit: ah, so adding links to jQuery Core, for instance, or to completely unrelated projects is ok?
[15:02:23] <geekman-rohit> you are allowed to edit later , and we will review it and contact you if we need more data
[15:02:28] <sfrisk> if you want to work for chassis - submit something to chassis
[15:02:29] <nashvail> really? I mean we can go back and forth editing the proposal? That's awesome
[15:02:37] <sfrisk> That's how it worked last year anyway
[15:02:43] <geekman-rohit> all3fox what sfrisk said
[15:02:47] <all3fox> yep
[15:02:52] <geekman-rohit> you should contribute to chassis
[15:02:56] <all3fox> yep ^
[15:02:59] <geekman-rohit>  but mention other pRs as well
[15:03:20] <sfrisk> also I think there is the CSS components project where you're making CSS widgets
[15:03:24] <geekman-rohit> if they are related to the project*
[15:03:33] <all3fox> ok^
[15:03:51] <sfrisk> if that floats your boat, my suggest is sending in other code samples, since Chassis isn't necessarily ready for complicated widgets this month
[15:04:06] <sfrisk> we've had people submit code pen samples before
[15:04:35] <sfrisk> This is slightly ridiculously complicated, but I used to use this as an example: http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/BymJer
[15:05:01] <sfrisk> But stuff like a CSS loader works: http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/dYxjWg
[15:05:27] <nashvail> Hey sfrisk! that calculator is beautiful!
[15:05:28] <sfrisk> Kristyjy has some cool examples of stuff we would look for too: http://codepen.io/kristyjy/pen/zGOXYb
[15:05:43] <sfrisk> and http://codepen.io/kristyjy/pen/adXxax
[15:06:01] <sfrisk> so if you like doing fun stuff with CSS, put something up on codepen and show off
[15:06:06] <sfrisk> in this case, we like show-offs
[15:06:20] <sfrisk> http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/BjwyOv
[15:06:21] <all3fox> sfrisk thx, I understand
[15:06:30] <nashvail> Hey! uhh... If someone comes up to you and asks for just one tip before he/she starts writing their proposal what would it be. sfrisk? geekman-rohit?
[15:06:49] <sfrisk> Be detailed
[15:06:56] <geekman-rohit> lol nashvail
[15:07:03] <geekman-rohit> be detailed, yes
[15:07:07] <sfrisk> especially in your timeline, and the features you will deliver
[15:07:16] <geekman-rohit> and think a lot before you make it
[15:07:25] <geekman-rohit> commit to what you can accomplish
[15:07:34] <nashvail> geekman-rohit that doesn't count, it's exactly what sfrisk said üòÜ
[15:07:44] <sfrisk> mwuahaha, I spoke first, so I win!
[15:07:48] <geekman-rohit> lol
[15:07:51] <sfrisk> and thanks about the calculator ! ^_^
[15:08:04] <nashvail> üëç
[15:08:05] <all3fox> geekman-rohit ha-ha, Week 1 -- "install node.js" from your proposal, very detailed :)
[15:08:27] <geekman-rohit> all3fox im not sure that was what I meant
[15:08:39] <geekman-rohit> it meant setting up the environment for the project
[15:08:57] <all3fox> just kidding, I understand :)
[15:09:16] <all3fox> I spent like two weeks setting up tests for jQuery
[15:09:35] <nashvail> Also all proposals are supposed to be GDocs. and no images or anything right ?
[15:09:42] <geekman-rohit> the ideas on the ideas page are a base
[15:09:49] <geekman-rohit> your proposal should expand on that
[15:10:21] <all3fox> yep, no copy-paste, we understand :)
[15:10:55] <sfrisk> seriously, we've gotten proposals that were just copy-pastes
[15:11:01] <sfrisk> .... or a "Hi my name is ______" and that was it
[15:11:06] <sfrisk> do not do that
[15:11:26] <sfrisk> clog up my email with that and you'll have displeased sfrisk
[15:11:42] <nashvail> no one does that
[15:11:53] <nashvail> to sfrisk
[15:11:59] <sfrisk> hahahahahahaha
[15:12:15] * all3fox hears sfrisk's demonic laughter
[15:12:58] <nashvail> So I guess it'd be a good idea to submit a proposal early to have enough time for the back and forth editing of the drafts
[15:13:15] <geekman-rohit> nashvail yes
[15:13:44] <sfrisk> definitely
[15:14:08] <all3fox> nashvail you mean submitting the proposal via GSoC website or giving a link to GDoc directly to you? (just checking, suspect GSoC website)
[15:14:52] <sfrisk> when you submit a proposal, it will email us
[15:14:58] <sfrisk> so we can review it and leave comments/feedback
[15:15:10] <nashvail> The page does say "Draft" Proposal submission
[15:15:13] <all3fox> ok, thx ^
[15:16:53] <nashvail> That answers my queries. Almost 1 AM here isn't it geekman-rohit? üò¥ . Got classes tomorrow morning . Good night!
[15:17:30] <all3fox> thx, no more question, will be leaving too
[15:18:09] <sfrisk> Sleep? Who needs that?
[15:18:27] <nashvail> #NoSleepTeam
[15:18:33] <nashvail> #SleepIsForTheWeak
[15:20:24] <geekman-rohit> Yeah I got Shadows of Mordor to finish
[15:21:29] <sfrisk> I'm tempted to play the Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD tonight, but I have a talk on game dev I need to write for tomorrow
[15:21:31] <sfrisk> so we'll see
[15:22:43] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk finished inquisition?
[15:22:53] <sfrisk> ... I'm just before the last mission
[15:22:58] <geekman-rohit> and did you even start witcher 3 yet
[15:23:01] <sfrisk> no
[15:23:05] <geekman-rohit> wow you took months!
[15:23:38] <sfrisk> well I go back and forth between playing games a bunch for a week, and then being all "I haven't drawn in forever or been productive, I  must do all the things!"
[15:25:24] <all3fox> \leave
[15:25:51] * all3fox is an IRC noob
