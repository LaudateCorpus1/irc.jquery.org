[00:30:09] <chanaka> hi
[00:31:09] <chanaka> is there a developer mailing list for jquery ? I'm a new bee and wanted to get involve with jquery by contributing code
[05:25:55] <nano_> one of the ideas in gsoc2015 list is to create a wordpress theme that implements chassis. Will this require any direct contribution to chassis or the focus is only on preparing themes ?
[05:55:49] <arschmitz> nano_: That task cant be worked on yet but will be ready by the time coding for GSoC starts
[05:56:16] <arschmitz> nano_: for now i suggest checking out the issue tracker and https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students
[05:56:29] <prasunanand> arschmitz: Did you have a look at my PR?
[05:57:08] <prasunanand> I added tests for semantic ui
[05:57:22] <arschmitz> prasunanand: not really yet
[05:58:10] <prasunanand> Also there are many variations for Buttons. i wanted to know which combinations to take
[05:58:42] <arschmitz> prasunanand: looking real quick that does not work
[05:58:51] <arschmitz> you add tons of options that you never use
[05:59:39] <prasunanand> so, which ones to take : size, color and state
[05:59:41] <prasunanand> ?
[06:02:54] <nano_> arschmitz: I have gone through this. On what basis should I prepare my proposal then ?
[06:04:27] <arschmitz> prasunanand: the function gets a hash of options
[06:04:36] <arschmitz> you need to take that hash and create a valid button
[06:04:58] <arschmitz> it iterates through every possibility
[06:05:07] <arschmitz> so you should be based on this generating every possible button
[06:05:07] <geekman-rohit> I have a few questions about the proposal template (link provided on GSOC ideas page of jQuery Foundation) https://code.google.com/p/openintents/wiki/GSoCApplication
[06:05:22] <geekman-rohit> I did not understand what OI developer forum is
[06:05:24] <geekman-rohit> :P
[06:05:50] <geekman-rohit> The Proposal asks for a " Link to your discussion thread in the OI developer forum "
[06:06:05] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: in this case that would be issue threads
[06:06:25] <geekman-rohit> A pull request link ?? could that do?
[06:06:29] <prasunanand> arschmitz: yes, so i added the  different variations. And in the generator i have added options.size and options.scolor
[06:06:55] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: yes pr's are issues in github
[06:07:11] <geekman-rohit> thanks :)
[06:07:11] <arschmitz> prasunanand: right generator must handle every option you provide
[06:07:17] <arschmitz> your only handling 2
[06:08:15] <prasunanand> yes, So I think I should be adding the relevant variations and calling all of them in the generator
[06:08:46] <geekman-rohit> prasunanand, the variation on the current loop are available in the options object
[06:08:47] <arschmitz> prasunanand: but if certain combinations aren ot valid together you need to make sure you handle that
[06:09:03] <geekman-rohit> so options.icon is your icon for current loop, options.color is the color
[06:09:09] <arschmitz> and you need to make sure you have ones with no icon
[06:09:28] <prasunanand> yes; i saw that :)
[06:10:03] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, I have one last query, silly me, but new framework new PR? just confirming
[06:10:23] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: yes
[06:13:03] <nano_> arschmitz:  I have gone through this. On what basis should I prepare my proposal then?
[06:15:49] <arschmitz> nano_: you dont need the code to do a proposal
[06:20:27] <nano_> arschmitz: what about the link to demo or the patch submitted and the link to OI thread?
[06:20:55] <arschmitz> nano_: that does not need to be related to your proposal just to this project
[06:22:26] <nano_> arschmitz: Alright. Thanks.
[06:22:43] <arschmitz> nano_: for example https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/45 and https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/5#issuecomment-77381112
[06:25:52] <nano_> arschmitz: I get this, but for this project there is no need for this right ?
[06:26:13] <arschmitz> nano_: no there is these are examples on this project
[06:28:29] <nano_> arshmitz: these are related to implementing a wordpress theme ?
[06:30:06] <arschmitz> they are related to chassis
[06:30:13] <arschmitz> which is what we are looking for
[06:34:29] <nano_> arschmitz: if it is a different project how does implementing chassis relate to working on chassis?
[06:35:56] <arschmitz> chassis is all one project
[06:36:06] <arschmitz> there are just different tasks related to it
[06:37:46] <nano_> arschmitz: cool. thanks.
