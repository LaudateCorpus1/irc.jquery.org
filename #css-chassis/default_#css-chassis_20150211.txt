[04:34:18] <aspirar> Hello. I had asked a question yesterday, but then I went offline, but I did check the logs. I just wanted to know, what exactly is chassis? A CSS framework? And where is the code for it? Or is it still in development? There are a few ideas on the gsoc wiki about implementing themes with chassis, so how do I get started with that?
[04:34:47] <arschmitz> aspirar: 'hi
[04:34:57] <aspirar> hi
[04:35:16] <arschmitz> aspirar: Chassis is really several things at different levels
[04:35:22] <arschmitz> or will be
[04:35:31] <arschmitz> aspirar: its still in the planning and development phase
[04:36:07] <arschmitz> aspirar: the best place to see whats going on so far is our issue tracker https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues
[04:36:45] <arschmitz> aspirar: as far as themes theres not anything you could do for that YET
[04:37:23] <aspirar> Okay, so it is still in development :) I will look at the issue tracker and see if I can help in anything.
[04:38:09] <arschmitz> aspirar: Yeah since we have not actually been accepted yet and the program has not started yet
[04:38:28] <arschmitz> many of the ideas are things that we think will be ready to work on by the start but are not yet
[04:38:48] <aspirar> Okay, no problem. I can still contribute, right?
[04:38:55] <arschmitz> oh of course
[04:39:00] <arschmitz> we welcome all contribution and input
[04:39:15] <aspirar> :)
[04:40:26] <arschmitz> aspirar: sfrisk ( the project lead ) and I just actually officially announced the project publicly yesterday. So its still a very new project.
[04:41:27] <aspirar> Okay! That explains my initial confusion. I was looking for code on GitHub, but couldn't find any. And another CSS framework called chassis further confused things.
[04:41:41] <arschmitz> there is another?
[04:41:45] <arschmitz> do you have a link to that?
[04:41:57] <aspirar> Just wait a bit.
[04:42:26] <aspirar> arschmitz: Here's the link: http://connors.github.io/chassis/
[04:42:32] <arschmitz> aspirar: thanks
[09:35:51] <jzaefferer> how did we miss https://github.com/connors/chassis ?
[09:41:02] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah :-(
[09:41:06] <sfrisk> no idea
[09:41:07] <arschmitz> i think i know how actually
[09:41:17] <sfrisk> I was pretty sure we all searched for Chassis
[09:41:21] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i dont think it ranked on first page of google previously
[09:41:22] <jzaefferer> What was the other name candidate we had?
[09:41:32] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: but i think all the stuff around us made it rank up
[09:41:35] <arschmitz> draft
[09:41:46] <arschmitz> but there is no real need to change i dont think
[09:41:48] <jzaefferer> Right, what I voted for :-)
[09:41:55] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: me too draft was my idea lol
[09:42:06] <sfrisk> Chassis was my suggestion :-/
[09:42:10] <jzaefferer> well, should probably contact the guy
[09:42:26] <jzaefferer> at least we have a logo!
[09:42:43] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: we can or we can just ignore it we are not breaking any law and his project has been inactive for a year
[09:42:47] <arschmitz> and has no other contributors
[09:43:28] <jzaefferer> well, it already confused one person
[09:43:33] <arschmitz> yup
[09:43:59] <arschmitz> i have mixed feelings
[09:44:23] <jzaefferer> you can suggest to use "draft" to him :p
[09:44:44] <arschmitz> lol
[09:46:46] <sfrisk> there is only so many framework-y type words in the english language
[09:49:56] <jzaefferer> There are many other languages :-)
[09:57:49] <sfrisk> true
[10:11:17] <scott_gonzalez> But we get to use my favorite ticket resolution: unfortunate ;-)
[10:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> https://code.google.com/p/go/issues/detail?id=9
[10:11:31] <arschmitz> lol yup
