[15:26:57] <michaelarestad> arschmitz: Might be worth adding view.css-chassis.com to the README.
[15:27:29] <arschmitz> yup
[15:27:43] <arschmitz> Hey also can you add htmllint to the gruntfile in that pr
[15:27:59] <arschmitz> it should catch that single quotes issue
[15:28:02] <michaelarestad> To typography?
[15:28:10] <arschmitz> yeah
[15:28:17] <arschmitz> thats the first thing to add the demos folder
[15:28:17] <michaelarestad> Yep. Noted. Will add tonight.
[15:28:29] <arschmitz> which is what needs to be checked
[15:28:45] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[15:29:16] <arschmitz> it might also be worth taking that inline style block
[15:29:25] <arschmitz> and make a demos.css
[15:29:27] <michaelarestad> Will add to the `test` task.
[15:29:29] <arschmitz> or demos.scss
[15:29:33] <michaelarestad> Yep. Will do.
[15:29:35] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: yup perfect
[15:29:49] <michaelarestad> Could probably just be CSS. Shouldn't be anything fancy in it yet.
[15:29:55] <michaelarestad> And we can convert when we need to.
[18:28:09] <michaelarestad> Updated the typography PR with htmllint. (#57)
[18:53:27] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: leaving a couple comments right now
[18:53:33] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[18:53:45] <michaelarestad> Expected.
[18:54:09] <arschmitz> nothing big couple super minor things
