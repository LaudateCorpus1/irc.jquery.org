[16:46:49] <Akshay> hi rohit mulange...I found the idea: 'components for css framework and javascript library' very interesting and  I am interested in contributing to the this idea as a part of GSOC-2016.i'd already implement some components for css like hover button parallex background etc.
[16:46:49] <Akshay> What further steps would you recommend at this point and where do i start?
