[05:39:42] <nano_> I want to contribute to Chassis through GSOC2015 by creating a cms theme. Can somebody brief me on this ?
[05:41:01] <arthurvr> nano_: First of all, read https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/Getting-started-for-students and go through contribute.jquery.org :)
[05:41:10] <arthurvr> Did you have any questions in specific?
[05:42:58] <arthurvr> nano_: then, go to the open tickets (https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis) and try to get involved. There’s no real coding yet but there are many interesting discussions.
[06:47:14] <prasunanand> I am new to testing . I wrote the test for buttons(semantic-UI). Different variations of buttons can be. So while testing which combinations need to be used.the variations are listed here http://pastebin.com/79r18R76
[08:18:06] <prasunanand> arschmitz, need some help.
[09:34:58] <geekman-rohit> hey prasunanad looks like he isnt available
[09:35:50] <geekman-rohit> I sent a PR and all improvements were suggested and queries resolved line by line in comments
[09:38:54] <arthurvr> geekman-rohit: Sorry we were that aggressive reviewing your PR, btw. Good to hear it’s addressed already, thanks!
[09:39:26] <geekman-rohit> arthurvr, arschmitz had warned me before had that would happen, I was expecting it
[09:39:42] <arthurvr> geekman-rohit: okay then :)
[09:39:58] <geekman-rohit> I corrected everything in the next commit ;) hopefully :P
[09:40:50] <geekman-rohit> arthurvr, I am adding another framework? do i add to the same PR?? or create another one
[09:41:54] <arthurvr> Awesome, thanks! No idea what the chassis team prefers, but I would personally opt to do a second PR.
[09:42:27] <geekman-rohit> Okay, thanks!
[09:43:39] <prasunanand> arthurvr, can u have a look at my PR?
[09:43:54] <prasunanand> :)
[09:44:05] <arthurvr> I think you’d better ask somebody on the chassis team for that, but I can take a look.
[09:44:15] <arthurvr> Will do it this evening
[09:44:25] <prasunanand> Thanks
[10:00:38] <arthurvr> prasunanand: Regarding that PR, you will need to sign the CLA. http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/
[10:00:50] <prasunanand> i signed it
[10:01:12] <prasunanand> do i need to sync my PR py pushing again
[10:01:27] <arthurvr> You signed but with an invalid name.
[10:01:40] <arthurvr> `prasunanand` isn’t a real name.
[10:03:09] <arthurvr> prasunanand: as that’s the name in your git config too, you will need to update your commit.
[10:03:30] <arthurvr> prasunanand: it’s all beautifully explained on http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/status/?repo=css-chassis&sha=2875a8b5aaaab5534994055fece7e71b4f27ee64.
[10:04:21] <prasunanand> Thanks, Got it
[10:05:07] <arthurvr> prasunanand: you can just sign it again.
[10:05:34] <prasunanand> Ok
[11:18:27] <prasunanand> arthurvr, Is my code OK
[11:19:37] <arthurvr> prasunanand: Didn’t have a chance to review it yet. Probably won’t have the time today anymore, sorry! (but I’m sure somebody will review it quickly)
[11:20:11] <prasunanand> Cool (y)
