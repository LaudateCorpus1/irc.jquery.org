[05:41:52] <bukai> Hi all, I was interested in the "Create a theme for a CMS that implements Chassis" , idea, from the gsoc ideas list. Can someone please guide me as to how to proceed?
[05:42:37] <arschmitz> bukai: that task cant be worked on yet
[05:42:53] <arschmitz> because chassis is new and there is nothing to create a theme from yet :-)
[05:43:36] <bukai> arschmitz: are there any similar tasks hat I can start working on?
[05:43:45] <bukai> *that
[05:44:27] <arschmitz> not similar because there is not code for chassis yet really. so any of the tasks that involve implementing chassis cant be done yet
[05:44:37] <arschmitz> it would have to be one of the more development related tasks
[05:46:12] <bukai> arschmitz: Ok , thanks :)
[06:03:10] <ythej> arschmitz, ping
[06:16:02] <prasun> sfrisk, I have gone through the issues. How should I begin?
[06:16:34] <prasun> with developing
[06:16:48] <arschmitz> ythej: Hi

[06:17:07] <prasun> sure :)
[06:17:21] <sfrisk> we're currently waiting on a PR to land before some more development can happen, which will be covering forms, typgoraphy, base html elements, etc
[06:18:47] <ythej> arschmitz, I saw your message on other channel.
[06:18:57] <arschmitz> ok
[06:19:01] <prasun> ok

[11:00:02] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk, I got tons on questions
[11:00:12] <sfrisk> What's up?
[11:00:34] <geekman-rohit> Nothing, except pretty excited
[11:00:49] <sfrisk> It's a fun project to be on
[11:00:54] <geekman-rohit> Umm Is v1 gona be a full framework?
[11:01:08] <geekman-rohit> as in like bootstrap??
[11:02:04] <michaelarestad> Ideally, it will be a very light framework.
[11:02:16] <michaelarestad> Similar to bootstrap in some aspects, but not as ambitious for a V1.
[11:02:38] <geekman-rohit> Understood
[11:03:50] <geekman-rohit> anything material-design like? I kinda liked those Polymer Paper things
[11:05:15] <sfrisk> V1 will be more like the css page for bootstrap, not the UI components found on Components and Javascript
[11:05:44] <sfrisk> stuff to get you started on a website, but not necessarily super opinionated about how everything should be styled
[11:06:00] <sfrisk> which how bootstrap gets with the Components/Javascript pages
[11:06:35] <milesj> I'm more curious why you guys chose to start yet another framework, instead of contributing to an existing one.
[11:06:59] <prasun> arschmitz, I have worked with highcharts,js . I can help in plotting the data on a graph.
[11:07:26] <prasun> regarding performance testing
[11:07:45] <sfrisk> milesj: we actually were looking to go in that direction at first, but found none of the existing frameworks served the needs we had
[11:07:59] <milesj> sfrisk https://github.com/titon/toolkit
[11:12:07] <sfrisk> we're looking to aspects of material-design geekman-rohit
[11:12:34] <geekman-rohit> I would love to work parallel trying to add material-design components
[11:19:51] <prasun> sfrisk, When the PRs will be merged?
[11:20:22] <sfrisk> prasun: should be later today, once we have a chance
[11:44:54] <prasun> sfrisk, can i use bourbon.io for making the css framework. it is a well-maintained library
[12:03:05] <sfrisk> prasun: at the current time, no.  Also we're using lib-sass just as a headsup
[12:04:42] <prasun> cool
[12:22:43] <thejdeep> arschmitz, can you open the perf issue ?
[12:23:02] <sfrisk> thejdeep: he's in a meeting right now
[12:23:22] <sfrisk> thejdeep: he'll get to it as soon as he has a chance.
[12:23:30] <thejdeep> sfrisk, oops, sorry
[12:23:39] <thejdeep> sfrisk, sure ! thanks
[12:24:03] <michaelarestad> I'm a bit late, but I don't see a major reason to use bourbon or compass.
[12:24:23] <sfrisk> I think we had a discussion about it in one of the threads at one point
[12:24:28] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[13:33:44] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] sfrisk opened issue #43: Create Semantic Color Variable Name http://git.io/xihT
[19:50:03] <thejdeep> arschmitz, sfrisk when will this PR be merged ? https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/34
[19:50:17] <sfrisk> arschmitz in the middle of working on it right now
[19:50:46] <arschmitz> thejdeep: we all have other projects we work on and most of us have other day jobs
[19:50:49] <sfrisk> however, we both had a meetup we were at tonight, plus he has responsibilities for other projects (he's also lead of the jquery mobile project)
[19:51:01] <sfrisk> so sometimes it takes us time to get to a task
[19:51:07] <arschmitz> thejdeep: so some times other things are a higher priority
[19:51:43] <arschmitz> thejdeep: that is at the top of my list right now but iv only had about an hour of free time since the chassis meeting today
[19:52:03] <thejdeep> arschmitz, sure, let me know if I can help out in adding more components/frameworks
[19:52:25] <arschmitz> thejdeep: dont worry as soon as i merge that im going to open an issue with instructions to add more
[19:52:41] <thejdeep> arschmitz, cool, thanks
[23:36:10] <Valar_morghulis> Hi name is Sachin and I am an undergrad interested in contributing to JQuery Foundation as part of GSoC 2015. I'd like to discuss about the project idea - Chassis - Create a theme for a CMS that implements Chassis. Could someone please elaborate a bit more on what else is needed and help me get started ?
