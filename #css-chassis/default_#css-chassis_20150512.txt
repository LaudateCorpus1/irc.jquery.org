[10:06:12] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] sfrisk opened issue #80: <progress> <meter> and div based fallback for JS http://git.io/vUaBt
[11:01:50] <michaelarestad> sfrisk: Anything I miss/need to do?
[11:03:02] <sfrisk> did you table the scroll styling out of the table??
[11:03:34] <michaelarestad> That's a bizarre sentence, but I separated the scroll styling into it's own CSS component.
[11:03:44] <michaelarestad> It's still in the Table PR.
[11:03:58] <sfrisk> Okay, I created an issue for a visual scroll indicator
[11:04:05] <michaelarestad> Awesome.
[11:04:07] <sfrisk> so we could have a discussion about how we want to handle that

[11:04:35] <sfrisk> also giving <progress><meter> plus div callback to geekman
[11:04:43] <sfrisk> and I think you're on form inputs and I'm on buttons
[11:05:11] <sfrisk> fallback* not callback

[11:05:43] <michaelarestad> Started messing with form elements this last week. Definitely not PR-able for a bit.
