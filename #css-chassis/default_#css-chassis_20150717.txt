[06:35:53] <eugler> Hey everybody
[06:37:35] <eugler> I really feel like we don't need another CSS framework. Why didn't y'all just contribute to others and instead do everything over. Last year there were already so much CSS frameworks coming out
[06:38:54] <eugler> sfrisk: I saw you at the conference, fyi
[06:40:51] <sfrisk> Hey eugler
[06:41:40] <eugler> I don't want CSS frameworks to become like javascript ones. Where we've got the "yet another framework syndrome"
[06:41:51] <sfrisk> We had actually discussed contributing to an active project instead of doing something on our own
[06:42:19] <sfrisk> but eventually decided our needs for Chassis were different than what we had seen from other CSS Frameworks
[06:44:33] <sfrisk> Since Chassis is a bit more than a css framework
[06:44:38] <sfrisk> or rather, will be
[06:45:54] <eugler> Don't you think there have been a huge amount of frameworks and that it's getting similar to the javascript situation?
[06:46:06] <arthurvr> comparing it with YAFS isn't really appropriate yet imho. Also, Chassis clearly has other needs than the existing solutions.
[06:47:17] <eugler> I guess so, then. Still I don't get why it isn't just a bootstrap (or any other framework) fork, just like GitHub did.
[06:50:25] <eugler> I don't really think you're for a discussion so I'm going to leave. Bye!
