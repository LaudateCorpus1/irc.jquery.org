[09:05:11] <sfrisk> geekman-rohit - I'm stuck in a meeting right now
[09:05:15] <sfrisk> didn't know it was going this long
[09:05:39] <sfrisk> I have some ideas I worked through with wireframing last night, but can we possibly move the gsoc discussion to after Chassis today?
[09:05:57] <sfrisk> that or arschmitz, if you want to have the discussion/checkin we can do that
[09:12:22] <geekman-rohit> thats fine.. we can do that after chassis meeting
[09:42:32] <sfrisk> Okay, work is being work-y today, I might have to delay the meeting by 10 minutes or so
[10:15:33] <arthurvr> no meeting today?
[10:15:43] <arthurvr> oh just saw your messages
[10:15:46] <arthurvr> okay
[10:43:56] <sfrisk> mini #gsoc party!
[10:44:03] <geekman-rohit> yay
[10:44:43] <sfrisk> Okay, so this was kinda rough idea, and I didn't get as far as I wanted to last night
[10:44:56] <geekman-rohit> I have quite a lot on my list today, both for discussion and work for me :)
[10:45:05] <sfrisk> colors/fonts aren't right, but I was thinking of a good way to have all the content we need for menus
[10:45:23] <sfrisk> and maybe having 2 sidebar menus might work
[10:45:24] <sfrisk> http://www.sarahfrisk.com/chassis/themeroller.jpg
[10:45:52] <geekman-rohit> Okay, that is amazing!
[10:45:55] <sfrisk> with the darker sidebar capable of opening up to show a list of the different major sections of Chassis
[10:45:55] <sfrisk> http://www.sarahfrisk.com/chassis/themerollerb.jpg
[10:45:59] <geekman-rohit> like. COOL
[10:46:35] <sfrisk> the darker menu could be scrollable vertically, which might help with the tabbing issue as we have more sections
[10:47:01] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk the colors you choose are amazing
[10:47:06] <sfrisk> I was looking at ideas like what squarespace kinda has http://www.websitesmadesimple.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/squarespace-editor.png
[10:47:54] <sfrisk> where you have a higher level nav on the far left, with a more detailed nav specific to that section next to it
[10:48:06] <geekman-rohit> yeah we could have icons.. and full names on expanding the meny
[10:48:13] <geekman-rohit> menu*
[10:48:46] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:49:43] <sfrisk> Give me some time I can come up with something slightly better designed, but that was mostly a rough stab at how the UI could work, and how we could organize all the variables
[10:50:17] <geekman-rohit> so we have a top navbar and a sidebar
[10:50:22] <geekman-rohit> that is for sure
[10:50:51] <geekman-rohit> and I like the way you added tabs, my only concern is will we find icons for all major sections
[10:51:28] <sfrisk> yeah
[10:51:41] <sfrisk> that's why I originally just put in one of those indicators that "This menu can open"
[10:51:58] <geekman-rohit> well I dont see the problem with that either
[10:52:03] <geekman-rohit> its cool
[10:52:03] <sfrisk> we could probably use someone with design chops to help as figure out better abstract icons for the different sections
[10:52:13] <geekman-rohit> yep
[10:52:47] <geekman-rohit> i actually like it! I look forward to finishing my current pr and working on this :)
[10:54:28] <sfrisk> I'll work on coming up with something a bit better, but that was a general idea
[10:54:29] <geekman-rohit> and aluvi says TEXT will do us fine (for database schema)
[10:55:06] <geekman-rohit> if we could give him a size , he could be sure of it
[10:55:16] <geekman-rohit> so how large will be our data ?
[10:57:11] <sfrisk> errr, hard to tell right now :-(
[10:57:32] <sfrisk> I don't see it being too bad for phase 1, but when we get into UI elements it could possibly get more complicated
[10:57:46] <geekman-rohit> okay lets go with text, though we should decided on one before deployment
[10:57:50] <geekman-rohit> ?
[10:58:23] <geekman-rohit> we can change midway easily as long as its in development
[11:01:17] <geekman-rohit> text has 65,535 characters MEDIUMTEXT ahs 16,777,215
[11:01:44] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: did you think about storing the key value pairs in a string and compressing it as a single param in the url?
[11:01:44] <sfrisk> I am almost inclined to say MEDIUMTEXT
[11:02:13] <arschmitz> that way you could still have bookmarkable urls with out a DB?
[11:02:22] <arschmitz> and length would not be an issue
[11:02:41] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz we considered it, but we decided to use db because of number of variables
[11:02:51] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: no compressing it
[11:03:02] <arschmitz> dont do actual get key value pairs
[11:03:03] <geekman-rohit> we used the bootstrap page as example
[11:03:10] <arschmitz> store the whole config as a string
[11:03:13] <arschmitz> and compress the string
[11:03:38] <sfrisk> didn't we come up with a list of the number of variables we could save that way?
[11:03:40] <geekman-rohit> our number of vars could go above 1000 ?
[11:03:46] <sfrisk> and we were concerned that variables might be more than that
[11:03:46] <arschmitz> i think your missing the point
[11:03:49] <arschmitz> COMPRESSION
[11:04:04] <arschmitz> your assuming using full variable names and values
[11:04:14] <sfrisk> yes, I understand you're saying compression, I just thought we had discussed how much we could compress it, but I could be remembering it wrong
[11:04:15] <arschmitz> im saying make it a single string and compress the string
[11:04:21] <arschmitz> no
[11:04:30] <arschmitz> we only talked about ways to store it raw
[11:05:10] <sfrisk> Probably is a my bad then, we should probably document these meetings somewhere to better remember things
[11:05:17] <geekman-rohit> but even with compression ? if we have more that 1000 variables ? would it be possible
[11:05:40] <arschmitz> you would have to test to be sure but probably
[11:05:52] <arschmitz> there will be an incredible amount of repitition
[11:06:13] <geekman-rohit> that is true
[11:07:46] <arschmitz> also if you only support ie11 +
[11:07:50] <arschmitz> you can have longer urls
[11:08:01] <arschmitz> and that seems fine for themeroller if it solve a problem
[11:08:35] <geekman-rohit> umm what could be the maximum no. of variables
[11:08:58] <geekman-rohit> like the maximum we could have in phase 1
[11:09:15] <arschmitz> phase one probably less then 100
[11:09:33] <geekman-rohit> i think a url would do for phase one easily then
[11:09:34] <arschmitz> you could use something like this for compression https://github.com/pieroxy/lz-string
[11:10:04] <geekman-rohit> we can keep change later I guess
[11:10:29] <arschmitz> if we use a compressed string i dont forsee us ever having an issue
[11:10:41] <geekman-rohit> url solves a lot for us. Awfully lot
[11:10:46] <arschmitz> yup
[11:10:50] <sfrisk> on that note then, I would have as part of the download a link to the URL for their theme
[11:11:29] <arschmitz> should include a variable file either way
[11:11:35] <arschmitz> incase we change url structure
[11:11:42] <geekman-rohit> actually url is neat
[11:11:57] <sfrisk> agree, definitely a variable file as well too
[11:12:05] <geekman-rohit> different states of the theme are different urls so history can be tracked by user by simply bookmarking again
[11:12:10] <sfrisk> but also a url link
[11:12:13] <geekman-rohit> everytheme has a unique url
[11:12:18] <arschmitz> yes
[11:12:21] <geekman-rohit> yes
[11:12:24] <arschmitz> you can implement undo as just back
[11:12:30] <geekman-rohit> yep
[11:12:39] <geekman-rohit> it simplifies a loot for us
[11:12:51] <geekman-rohit> i would be more than happy to use this idea and dump mysql :D
[11:13:04] <arschmitz> i think it would be much better
[11:13:40] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk? your ideas?
[11:14:14] <sfrisk> if the variables will work in the url, then definitely
[11:14:23] <sfrisk> definitely for a phase 1 themeroller
[11:15:13] <sfrisk> if we're doing it that way then, do we want to save theme names?
[11:15:19] <sfrisk> or allow people to be able to search themes?
[11:15:24] <geekman-rohit> no actually
[11:15:29] <sfrisk> since that was some of the advantages of mysql
[11:15:58] <geekman-rohit> is that important
[11:15:59] <geekman-rohit> ?
[11:16:14] <sfrisk> more of a question of "Is that Important"
[11:16:14] <geekman-rohit> we could have a db still
[11:16:26] <geekman-rohit> which save the url itself
[11:16:31] <geekman-rohit> if the user chooses to share
[11:16:47] <sfrisk> I mean you could rely on manual sharing of a url
[11:17:12] <geekman-rohit> or we could save the url itself in db.. going ahead if we decide to implement sharin
[11:17:31] <sfrisk> but I think it would be nice if the themeroller made it easier to explore quickly some things themes others designed
[11:17:49] <sfrisk> I mean, I think Sharing is probably more of a future goal
[11:17:55] <sfrisk> outside the scope of the work of GSOC
[11:18:05] <geekman-rohit> i dont see how url will stop us doing that?
[11:18:12] <sfrisk> URL is fine
[11:18:25] <sfrisk> more just finding an easy way for people to discover what other people made
[11:18:27] <geekman-rohit> i agree with what sfrisk said
[11:18:31] <sfrisk> beyond someone sharing a link with them directly
[11:18:33] <geekman-rohit> that would be cool
[11:18:36] <geekman-rohit> yeah
[11:18:53] <sfrisk> but I think 'sharing' or a 'theme gallery' probably is out of scope for this summer
[11:19:08] <sfrisk> we want a basic working themeroller first
[11:19:37] <geekman-rohit> we should keep it in mind though, so its easily accomplished later
[11:20:32] <geekman-rohit> so are we going to agree to the url thing? or wait for some more input from others?
[11:20:45] <geekman-rohit> ill start an issue if thats so?
[11:24:00] <arschmitz> just go with it for now
[11:24:04] <arschmitz> so you can work
[11:24:23] <arschmitz> but open an issue still
[11:25:30] <geekman-rohit> sure
[11:26:00] <arschmitz> and probably either comment on or maybe even close the DB issue
[11:27:20] <sfrisk> I might rename the DB issue, have it be a future thing, related to having a theme gallery in the future
[11:28:18] <sfrisk> because database was something I do remember us talking about possibly needing if we want sharing to work (couchDB vs mysql I believe was the big discussion)
[11:29:13] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk I think we should close it and reopen another
[11:29:18] <sfrisk> Okay
[11:29:32] <sfrisk> but at least have an issue in there to discuss how best to do a theme gallery in the future
[11:29:56] <sfrisk> we can start with nothing being in the DB, but I would like a way to share popular ideas
[11:30:03] <sfrisk> after this summer
[11:31:59] <geekman-rohit> cool :)
[11:32:37] <arschmitz> sfrisk: as a temp measure
[11:32:43] <sfrisk> This does mean refining the design again, since we're not exactly going to be 'saving' themes or naming them
[11:32:51] <arschmitz> you could get some different designers to make some themes
[11:33:00] <arschmitz> and just have a curated set like UI
[11:35:17] <sfrisk> Could finish setting up the chassis twitter account, and encourage people to tweet their Chassis Themeroller links
[11:35:25] <sfrisk> and set up a twitter alert on it
[11:35:36] <sfrisk> if we see something we like, we could add it to the list
[11:35:44] <arschmitz> yea
[11:35:50] <sfrisk> as a temp solution
[11:35:53] <arschmitz> you could also add a twitter feed to the layout
[11:36:05] <sfrisk> further on down the line, I would like to be able to have the community easily curate themes though
[11:36:05] <arschmitz> to show the most recent tweets with #chassis-theme
