[03:17:21] <geekman-rohit> "Chassis is an attempt at creating open standards designed for CSS libraries,"
[03:17:30] <geekman-rohit> the first phase is css-framework
[03:17:50] <geekman-rohit> something like bootstrap. if you are familiar with it, but more focused on standards
[03:18:19] <geekman-rohit> Chassis team will be looking for a Drupal/Wordpress template designed with chassis
[03:22:31] <devakm> ok
