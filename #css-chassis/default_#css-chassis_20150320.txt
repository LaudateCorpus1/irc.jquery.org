[07:15:16] <MelodyCuida> Hello?
[07:16:14] <MelodyCuida> I need some help
[08:39:52] <KalmaneCKN> Hello. I am Chinmaya studying computer science engineering. I am interested in contributing to the jquery foundation in this Coocle Summer of Code 2015. I am familiar with HTML and CSS. I am interested in contributing to this project. Can someone please guide me?? Thank you.
[08:55:24] <KalmaneCKN> Somone please do reply. Any help will be appreciated..Please..
[09:37:01] <arschmitz> KalmaneCKN: Hi how exactly can i help you?
[09:39:23] <KalmaneCKN> arschmitz: I need some guidance as to what I can contribute to this project as part of the Gsoc-2015. I am familiar with HTML and CSS.
[09:39:46] <arschmitz> KalmaneCKN: which task were you interested in?
[09:52:09] <KalmaneCKN> Styling components for JS libraries. Although I have a pretty good knowledge of HTML and CSS required for this, I am clueless as to how I should apply them to this task.
[09:54:49] <sfrisk> well you'll be creating UI components, similar to what is in jQuery Mobile and jQuery UI right now, however right now both frameworks do things differently
[09:55:11] <sfrisk> so you would be creating those components for Chassis, that would later become the standard for what jQuery Mobile and jQuery UI use
[09:55:56] <sfrisk> For applying, I would look over both frameworks, and come up with a list of UI Components that should be made this summer (for example accordions)
[09:56:28] <sfrisk> and come up with a timeline on how long you think it would take to get things done
[09:56:56] <sfrisk> also include some sort of css/html (or scss) sample with your appliction so we can see your coding style
[09:57:19] <sfrisk> Just style a widget or something
[09:57:20] <sfrisk> http://codepen.io/sfrisk/pen/BymJer
[10:11:46] <KalmaneCKN> Ok. But I am still a novice coder and I do not have any prerequisiteknowledge about frameworks (Although I am eager to learn). All I know is some basic styling. What should I do?
[10:14:49] <sfrisk> Just look at what sort of widgets those frameworks have (http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.5/) (http://jqueryui.com/demos/)
[10:15:27] <sfrisk> and for your coding sample, just make something with html and css
[10:15:49] <sfrisk> doesn't have to have JS to function, I just want to see what your CSS/html style is like
[10:33:24] <KalmaneCKN> sfrisk:AAh..now I understood this. Cool. I'll definitely craete some user interface components.
[10:33:47] <KalmaneCKN> Where should I submit coding sample?
[10:47:55] <sfrisk> Just use codepen or jsbin to style some sort of widget

[23:52:11] <MelodyCuida> Hello sfrist
[23:52:49] <MelodyCuida> sfrisk, I'v been asking help from this IRC
[23:58:26] <MelodyCuida> I forked your project from github, and read your source code. It seems that you utilize other framework's components like bootstrap and jquery-ui, and I did'nt see  your own implementation of standards. ps: I'm interested in contributing to 'Chassis - Create a theme for a CMS that implements Chassis'
