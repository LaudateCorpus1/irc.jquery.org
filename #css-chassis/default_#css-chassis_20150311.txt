[02:54:30] <Samat> Good night everyone. I was just wondering is there still something to add logo design at https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/27 ?
[02:55:29] <Samat> The logo looks great and seems that everyone agrees on that, but the issue is still open
[04:52:21] <arschmitz> Samat: there is more to a logo then just a single design
[04:52:34] <arschmitz> Samat: you have to think about color variations and different usages
[04:52:42] <arschmitz> Samat: our designer is working on it still
[05:28:14] <trailofdad> You folks hard of Microsoft Azure?
[05:28:35] <trailofdad> I just got a years access from my school :D
[08:47:11] <Samat> arschmitz: thanks. I got it.
[09:45:07] <Samat> I have some issues testing css-chassis. I successfully setup Chassis following the guide and started couchdb. But "grunt perf" gives a fatal error. By the way "grunt connect:dev" runs the server alright.
[09:47:46] <Samat> The error is
[09:47:51] <Samat> samat@ubuntu:~/Desktop/css-chassis-master$ grunt perf
[09:47:52] <Samat> Running "start-selenium-server:dev" (start-selenium-server) task

[09:52:04] <arschmitz> Samat: please see https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/47 and https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pull/44
[10:11:33] <Samat> arschmitz: great! thanks! I will try it!
[13:03:10] <prasunanand> sfrisk: Is it possible to create a pattern library website where the user can just customise the components and download the stylesheet file.
[13:03:45] <prasunanand> I mean integrating the pattern library with theme-roller
[13:18:15] <sfrisk> prasunanand: theme roller may very well use parts of the pattern library
[13:19:36] <prasunanand> But would it make sense if the user can edit components in pattern library and download the scss.
