[12:13:51] <prasun___> arschmitz: I saw Chassis. I am not sure what is it exactly. Are there any websites currently implementing chassis
[12:18:32] <sfrisk> @prasun___: Not currently. Chassis is a CSS Framework that is currently in development
[12:21:05] <prasun___> Oh Nice! I saw the jquery ideas page for GSOC. A lot of them interest me. Its tough to pick one. How to get started with chassis?
[12:21:39] <sfrisk> You can find the repo at css-chassis.com  Go through the issues, comment on them
[12:21:57] <sfrisk> It will help give you a feel for where we are in the project.
[12:22:08] <sfrisk> Also we have a meeting every wednesday at 1pm EST in IRC
[12:22:13] <sfrisk> in the #jquery-meeting channel
[12:22:33] <arschmitz> prasun___: yeah what she said lol sfrisk is the project lead for chassis
[12:23:05] <prasun___> :)
[12:23:53] <prasun___> sfrisk: Thanks
[18:17:33] <css-chassis738> hello there, can someone help me with my question or it is early to ask?
[18:17:51] <michaelarestad> Possibly. What's up?
[18:18:24] <css-chassis738> I just checked ideas of this group
[18:18:47] <css-chassis738> and I consider myself in novice - medium level
[18:19:10] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: do you mean for the GSoC group?
[18:19:23] <css-chassis738> yes
[18:19:42] <arschmitz> sfrisk: or myself can probably help you there
[18:20:11] <css-chassis738> and I was thinking if I choose an idea wich is mostly relevant to my skill will I be mostly staying in that group ?
[18:21:04] <css-chassis738> and learn more ? sorry if my question sounds weird I just don't know how actually it will work
[18:21:32] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: you will be working with every one but sfrisk an i are the mentors for this project for GSoC so other might not be familiar with the tasks we put up to work on however michaelarestad im sure can help you with general chassis stuff we are working on
[18:22:20] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: well this is our first year as a mentor organization too so we are still working on this too
[18:22:39] <arschmitz> this is also a brand new project so there is not even really any code yet
[18:22:52] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: by the way hi!
[18:23:01] <michaelarestad> Yep. After next week I'll be pretty available and jamming on this.
[18:23:07] <michaelarestad> arschmitz: hi!
[18:23:09] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: awesome
[18:23:13] <css-chassis738> I know HTML CSS and learning Javascript now wanna prepare myself ... will I be elegible to be accepted I don't know Jquery
[18:23:25] <css-chassis738> hi sorry
[18:23:44] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: chassis is  just css and html other then some js in the tools we use
[18:23:45] <michaelarestad> If you know some JS, jQuery isn't too bad to pick up. I'm not sure how much it'll be used yet.
[18:23:49] <arschmitz> and does not use jquery
[18:24:17] <arschmitz> so there is no requirement to know jquery to work on chassis chassis is just a project from the jQuery foundation no direct connection to the jQuery library
[18:24:25] <css-chassis738> will I be learning as we move on too ?
[18:24:55] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: i would deffinitly expect you to learn as you work i learn things workin on these projects every day :-)
[18:25:15] <css-chassis738> probably I am the first student who start chatting with you guys
[18:25:24] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: far far far from it
[18:25:36] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: i have spent nearly have my day answeing studen questions today
[18:25:46] <css-chassis738> nice :)
[18:26:04] <css-chassis738> I desperately wanna participate
[18:26:15] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: there is plenty of work to be done
[18:26:30] <css-chassis738> and hope to shape my skills and learn more
[18:26:40] <css-chassis738> I will go for it
[18:26:43] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: i really want to get your pr and my pr's we have outstanding landed and get started on some real work
[18:26:55] <michaelarestad> Awesome.
[18:26:57] <css-chassis738> as long as I learn and practice that's all I care :)
[18:27:15] <css-chassis738> pr ?
[18:27:35] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: front end development changes so fast you will always be learning no matter how long you have been doing it
[18:27:50] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: PR stands for pull request we do all out work through pull requests
[18:27:52] <css-chassis738> totally agree :)
[18:28:15] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: michaelarestad and i each have one open right now we need to finish https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/pulls
[18:30:59] <css-chassis738> does it mean in this project we will be working this way ? meaning it will be based on project ?
[18:32:12] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: im not sure what you mean?
[18:33:05] <css-chassis738> @arschmitz  I guess I need more practice to participate being fluent with HTML & CSS and learning Javascript just now doesn't seem enough :(
[18:33:30] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: actually no those are pretty much the only things we use
[18:33:41] <arschmitz> im just not sure what your trying to ask with your last question?
[18:34:05] <sfrisk> yay michalarestad!
[18:34:06] <css-chassis738> can you tell me we will be using mostly github
[18:34:37] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: yes all the jquery foundation projects ( as well as most other open source projects ) use github to host all our code
[18:34:41] <sfrisk> Give me some PRs
[18:34:50] <css-chassis738> how can I pull request ?
[18:35:24] <css-chassis738> please don't get me wrong English isn't my native language
[18:35:35] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: you do a pull request by forking the project commiting some changes and then submitting that as a pull request ( one you form and make changes there will be a button to do this right on github )
[18:35:54] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: thats fine many of the people that work on jQuery foundation projects do not speak english as their native language
[18:36:30] <css-chassis738> got it
[18:36:53] <css-chassis738> yo have only that open project for PR ?
[18:37:40] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: no all the projects have their own repositiores
[18:37:43] <arschmitz> on github
[18:37:55] <css-chassis738> let me check then
[18:38:07] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: if you want to familiarize yourself with github check out https://help.github.com/categories/bootcamp/
[18:38:52] <css-chassis738> i have an account I am just looking for all repositories
[18:39:03] <arschmitz> css-chassis738: and for a list of all jQuery foundation project you can go to https://github.com/jquery/
[18:39:17] <css-chassis738> thanks
[18:42:30] <css-chassis738> let me review them and thank you again
[18:47:38] <sfrisk> Yay people interested in Chassis
[18:47:39] <sfrisk> :-D
[18:57:09] <arschmitz> sfrisk: yup
[19:13:25] <thejdeep> sfrisk, would love to work on building a theme roller for chassis, please help me get started, any beginner tasks ?
[19:14:26] <sfrisk> We're still working on some other issues that are required before theme roller is ready for work
[19:15:06] <sfrisk> however, I would suggest checking out css-chassis.com and the issues listed there
[19:15:41] <sfrisk> also we have our weekly meeting at 1pm EST on Tuesdays in the #jquery-meeting chatroom where we discuss work that needs to get done
[19:16:59] <thejdeep> sfrisk, cool,thanks, will be there
[19:17:29] <sfrisk> looking forward to having you there
[19:18:10] <arschmitz> thejdeep: welcome!
[19:18:51] <arschmitz> thejdeep: if sfrisk is not around for any reason and you have a question you can feel free to ping me as well im her backup mentor :-)
[19:19:01] <thejdeep> sfrisk, arschmitz would like to get acquainted with the codebase, any issues that beginners can look into ?
[19:19:18] <thejdeep> arschmitz, thanks ! will surely do
[19:19:44] <arschmitz> thejdeep: there is no code base really currently
[19:19:55] <arschmitz> this is a new project
[19:20:10] <sfrisk> right now we're waiting on a PR for the initial file structue to land, then we're going to start work on typography, form elements, etc
[19:21:04] <thejdeep> sfrisk, ok sure
[20:48:09] <prasun_> sfrisk:I have gone through the issues. css-chassis is an awesome project.
[20:50:54] <prasun_> i think I can start with  Styling Components for JS Libraries or creating a Pattern Library of Chassis components
