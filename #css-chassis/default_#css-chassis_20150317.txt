[07:54:12] <geekman-rohit> hey, sfrisk, arschmitz had a few questions
[07:55:45] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: hey how can i help?
[07:56:33] <geekman-rohit> okay, so sfrisk gave me a review on the list of features in themeroller, she suggested that a integration with adobe kuler, as in jquery-mobile's themeroller would be great
[07:56:56] <geekman-rohit> but adobe kuler is nor adobe color-cc and they have stopped providing API keys
[07:57:21] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: right we were just saying something similar
[07:57:27] <arschmitz> though we do still have the mobile key
[07:57:34] <geekman-rohit> which we can use?
[07:57:39] <geekman-rohit> that would be awesome :)
[07:58:04] <geekman-rohit> I read on their blog that the service would continue running, just no more keys
[07:58:37] <geekman-rohit> I also found this : http://www.colourlovers.com/api
[07:58:50] <geekman-rohit> as a possible alternative
[07:59:12] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: we would prefer something non deprecated i think :-)
[07:59:48] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz : an alternative would be http://www.colourlovers.com/
[07:59:54] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: im talking with someone from adobe about this right now
[08:00:18] <geekman-rohit> your friend, who made topcoat? :D
[08:00:26] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: yup
[08:01:05] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: also if you do the whole thing as an api endpoint and just a front end ui
[08:01:13] <arschmitz> the extensions become almost zero effort
[08:01:33] <arschmitz> you can reuse the entire ui and just put it into an extension
[08:01:45] <arschmitz> and do a replace on the stylesheets
[08:01:58] <geekman-rohit> exactly, I guess we are talking about the firefox/chrome extension ?
[08:02:06] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: yes
[08:03:22] <geekman-rohit> I have given it a few days towards the end of timeline, the work would then just come to is packaging in appropriate form for the extensions
[08:03:34] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: does colourlovers have an api?
[08:03:40] <geekman-rohit> yes
[08:03:52] <geekman-rohit> json/xml and no keys, available kind of like feeds
[08:04:06] <geekman-rohit> http://www.colourlovers.com/api
[08:05:16] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: thank you
[08:06:22] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: they also mentioned they had started working on a module to produce HWB color schemes to match the css4 spec
[08:06:48] <geekman-rohit> they as in adobe guys ?
[08:09:58] <arschmitz> him personally
[08:10:05] <arschmitz> but its dead at this point
[08:10:49] <geekman-rohit> understood
[08:15:03] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] arschmitz opened issue #58: Setup view.css-chassis.com http://git.io/hO8V
[08:44:04] <michaelarestad> sfrisk: ping!
[08:44:08] <sfrisk> yes?
[08:45:20] <sfrisk> michaelarestad: what's up
[08:45:21] <michaelarestad> RE: the typography.html location: I don't think it should be where it is either. Any idea where it should live until we get a pattern library going?
[08:45:52] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: Hey
[08:46:19] <michaelarestad> arschmitz: Mornin.
[08:46:33] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: Hey i had a question for you
[08:46:40] <michaelarestad> Shoot.
[08:46:59] <sfrisk> we could have a folder called pattern_library or docs
[08:47:02] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: you had said that was a work in progress, so were you looking for like a full review or just feedback on the actual visual or what?
[08:47:08] <sfrisk> where we put the visual output of various components
[08:47:14] <arschmitz> sfrisk: michaelarestad: or demos could make sense too
[08:47:20] <sfrisk> demos works too
[08:47:39] <michaelarestad> arschmitz: Any running feedback is fine, but if I could label it, it would definitely be "in progress"
[08:48:08] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: sure i just didnt want to leave a bunch of nit pick comments if you were not looking for that sort of feedback
[08:48:13] <sfrisk> Okay, good to know
[08:48:36] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[08:49:28] <michaelarestad> Pretty to used keeping in progress PRs so others can take a look/comment as they progress.
[08:50:13] <michaelarestad> We could probably use a few labels to that nature. We use these: https://cloudup.com/cZUbfxa3kMv
[08:50:50] <sfrisk> I can create something like that for PRs
[08:51:24] <sfrisk> I like making labels :-)
[08:51:32] <michaelarestad> Rad. :)
[08:52:05] <michaelarestad> Super sick today so I'm going to be offline for the meeting. Just wanted to clarify a few bits. :)
[08:55:00] <sfrisk> Okay, sounds good.  Hope you feel better.
[08:55:55] <sfrisk> I busted my ankle this weekend, so it's been a big ball of not fun
[08:56:03] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: hope you feel better
[08:56:36] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: one thing i didn't comment but make sure you run grunt the tests will catch things for you :-)
[08:56:41] <michaelarestad> Thanks. Will take a look at your comments later.
[08:56:52] <michaelarestad> arschmitz: Like a pro I ran the linter after commit.
[08:57:02] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: and if you rebase master
[08:57:09] <arschmitz> the travis CI will work too
[08:57:15] <michaelarestad> Awesome.
[08:57:21] <michaelarestad> Will do.
[08:57:34] <michaelarestad> Later!
[08:57:34] <arschmitz> it was busted when you did the pr but i since fixed it
[08:57:40] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: take care later!
[10:00:57] <sfrisk> Meeting time over in #jquery-meeting
[11:11:48] <arschmitz> sfrisk: geekman-rohit: we will have to look at colourlovers licensing that might be complicated
[11:12:11] <arschmitz> sfrisk: geekman-rohit: each palet has its own license and terms of use
[11:12:34] <sfrisk> blarg
[11:13:23] <geekman-rohit> Umm, I'll keep hunting
[11:13:36] <arschmitz> yeah like most forbid commercial use
[11:13:42] <geekman-rohit> we can always, just in case, worst case scenario, use the old kuler api key
[11:13:59] <sfrisk> Yeah
[11:14:06] <arschmitz> which our use would not be but the vast majority of people using the theme roller probably are
[11:14:24] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, umm do they plan to close the api service?
[11:14:29] <geekman-rohit> adobe guys?
[11:14:38] <arschmitz> not that i know of
[11:15:06] <geekman-rohit> I'll look for more options, we can later start an issue and have a full discussion
[11:15:34] <geekman-rohit> and see if anyone else can suggest better options
[11:20:47] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: license type is also not a search param or a result field
[11:20:59] <arschmitz> so its not even like we could display or filter then license type
[11:21:05] <geekman-rohit> yes, I was looking at just that
[11:21:15] <geekman-rohit> I don't see why they have an api then :P
[11:21:25] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:21:51] <arschmitz> i dont think there is any way we should use this its like asking users to violate the terms of something
[11:22:14] <sfrisk> that's annoying
[11:23:43] <geekman-rohit> yeah :/
[11:25:21] <geekman-rohit> there is also the color picker to decide.. we can make, but theres a lot of cool ones available for jquery ui
[11:27:28] <sfrisk> I mean it looks like http://paletton.com/widget/ might let you add the Paletton.com engine to your site
[11:27:35] <sfrisk> but I thought you have to use their widget
[11:27:38] <sfrisk> think*
[11:27:43] <alexeiTruhin> What makes me unconfortable, is creating theme, whithout chassis finalized and without some examples
[11:31:40] <sfrisk> Understandable. It's why creating the theme is very much tied into creating components that would be needed for a theme
[11:31:48] <sfrisk> also I would look at creating more of a starter theme
[11:31:54] <sfrisk> rather than a full out designed theme
[11:32:25] <alexeiTruhin> what about this thing with 'design', is there anybody that could help us with this?
[11:32:37] <sfrisk> I could help you with design, and well as a few other people on the team
[11:33:02] <sfrisk> but the idea is for the CMS theme to be more of a starter theme
[11:33:12] <sfrisk> so it has our markup conventions, styling, etc in there
[11:33:30] <sfrisk> but it's still pretty bare bones so someone can build on top of it to really focus on design
[11:34:36] <sfrisk> For example, I used Bones (http://themble.com/bones/) as a starter theme
[11:35:02] <alexeiTruhin>  how do you think, when we will have basic element for creating a theme?
[11:35:49] <sfrisk> By the time you have to start coding, the typgoraphy, tables, forms, validation, and grid system should already be in place
[11:36:39] <sfrisk> basically stuff covered in phase one of the roadmap
[11:36:55] <sfrisk> so with the grid, and typography, you should be able to lay out a lot of the basics for the site
[11:37:37] <sfrisk> Then, you'll start styling more custom UI components, such as what a nav might look like
[11:37:58] <alexeiTruhin> I was asking, maybe it's gonna be sooner
[11:38:09] <alexeiTruhin> but ok
[11:38:30] <sfrisk> IF things are at a point earlier on that you could start working on a CMS sooner rather than later, you're more than welcome to do so
[11:39:02] <sfrisk> in your proposal I would include what elements you would need to create for a theme
[11:40:02] <alexeiTruhin> maybe another question is: Drupal's currently stable version is 7. But the Drupal 8 is already BETA, and everybody stop contributing to Drupal 7 and are working on Drupal 8
[11:40:12] <alexeiTruhin> so the question: which version of Drupal?
[11:41:09] <sfrisk> Either or
[11:41:25] <sfrisk> Drupal seven will still be used for awhile, since Drupal 8 is still in beta
[11:41:51] <sfrisk> But having a theme for Drupal 8 ready to go will help with early adoption
[11:42:27] <Samat_> sfrisk: yes. I also was thinking that it is more of a starter theme which will be flexible enough to contain new elements.
[11:42:40] <alexeiTruhin> I'll discuss it with the company in which I'm doing the internship, and relate details/ideas here.
[11:43:15] <sfrisk> In general, if you're doing the CMS theme - I would have your theme be a starter theme
[11:43:21] <Samat_> And since alexeiTruhin is working on Drupal I would be glad to take a look and apply for Wordpress
[11:44:56] <kristijan> can anyone help me with installing chassis
[11:45:53] <Samat_> kristijan: did you follow instructions at https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis ?
[11:47:05] <alexeiTruhin> kristijan: what version of nodejs do you use?
[11:47:32] <kristijan> yes I followed the isntructions
[11:47:38] <kristijan> first I had problems with grunt
[11:48:01] <geekman-rohit> kristijan: which OS?
[11:48:06] <kristijan> I installed it but told me that some files are missing I don't know why
[11:48:20] <kristijan> Linux Ubuntu
[11:48:34] <geekman-rohit> do a sudo npm install -g grunt
[11:48:48] <kristijan> I did that
[11:48:57] <alexeiTruhin> check your nodejs version
[11:49:00] <alexeiTruhin> node -v
[11:49:15] <kristijan> v0.12.0
[11:49:18] <alexeiTruhin> if it's > 0.10.* .. then you should downgrade
[11:49:25] <alexeiTruhin> downgrade it to 0.10.*
[11:49:29] <kristijan> ok thx
[12:16:59] <kristijan> I installe node v0.10.1 again errors
[12:17:07] <kristijan> installed**
[12:17:47] <trailofdad> sfrisk, can I email you what I currently have for my proposal for a quick look to see if I'm on the right track
[12:17:57] <sfrisk> sure, I can get to it later today
[12:18:04] <sfrisk> I'm at work right now
[12:18:28] <trailofdad> yeah, no rush, that would be great. Thanks!
[23:49:41] <sauravtom> Hi all, I am a GSOC aspirant looking for a good project to contribute in, is it too late to start contributing in css-chassis, given the premise that I know all the prerequisites for making valuable contributions.
