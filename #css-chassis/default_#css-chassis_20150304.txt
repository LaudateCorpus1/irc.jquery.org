[07:32:10] <sfrisk> Updated the meeting notes from yesterday: http://meetings.jquery.org/category/chassis/
[08:24:45] <prasunanand> sfrisk, I have been working with grid. I have set breakpoints at 600,768,960,1280,1440px. should the number of columns in each case be 12.
[08:32:50] <sfrisk> prasunanand: If you read the grid issue (https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/5), we're not quite ready for code for that at this point, since we're looking for a flexible grid solution, possibly similar to Susy
[08:33:46] <sfrisk> where the user can declare what type of grid system they need to best serve the needs of their project, rather than have an opinionated grid already in place that has too much overhead
[08:35:48] <prasunanand> where should i start with , in order to make contributions to the 'css-chassis'.
[08:35:51] <sfrisk> Here's a link to the susy website to get an idea of what we're thinking about: http://susy.oddbird.net/
[08:36:09] <sfrisk> Before coding anything, join in on discussions on the issues first, and post there
[08:36:33] <prasunanand> sure.
[08:38:08] <sfrisk> We're having a lot of discussion around each of the issues to try and come up with the best solution that fits the needs of the project and achieves the goals listed on https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis
[08:40:43] <sfrisk> That being said, if you have code samples you want to share, feel free to post a link in the issue discussion to show off your grid on codepen or jsbin (similar to what MichaelArestad did in Typography: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/16#issuecomment-68069322), but discussions in that grid issue are leading to having a Susy-like solution for the grid rather then an opinionated one we create
[08:41:18] <sfrisk> Mostly because a lot of us are frustrated with grid solutions like bootstrap, for example, that include way more functionality and overhead than is really required for most projects
[08:41:30] <sfrisk> and we want to keep the grid as simple as possible for the needs of a project.
[08:42:00] <michaelarestad> Some of us want to keep the grid in other projects.
[08:42:45] <prasunanand> Got it. I came up with something similar to cascade project. I am looking into susy
[08:42:49] * michaelarestad is still not a grid fan
[08:42:57] <prasunanand> michaelarestad, I didn't get you
[08:43:03] <prasunanand> oh
[08:43:47] <sfrisk> Grids can be useful, but more often than not a custom grid for a project is more useful than a "One size fits all" solution
[08:43:52] <michaelarestad> prasunanand: I'm font of Susy (and Bourbon because it's almost a  direct copy of Susy) because it lets the designer create the grid.
[08:44:07] <michaelarestad> *I'm font of...
[08:44:13] <sfrisk> fond*
[08:44:14] <sfrisk> :-)
[08:44:19] <prasunanand> :)
[08:44:19] <michaelarestad> Good grief I can't type this morning.
[08:44:31] <sfrisk> It's before noon.  No one can type before noon.
[08:45:10] <prasunanand> its midnight night here :)
[08:45:28] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: thats the beauty of a builder
[08:45:35] <arschmitz> dont want the grid dont include it :-)
[08:45:43] <michaelarestad> And I won't.
[08:45:56] <michaelarestad> But if there is a grid, I'll do my best to make sure it's pretty dang rad.
[08:45:58] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: and im sure you wont be the only one
[08:46:14] <sfrisk> I want the raddest grid that ever was
[08:47:39] <sfrisk> I was about to try and make that a song, but gave up
[08:47:47] <sfrisk> I've been preaching the good word of susy over here though
[08:47:53] <michaelarestad> Since it is a builder, it wouldn't be super difficult to include a few popular grids.
[08:48:20] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: i think our plan was to do a "grid builder" within the builder
[08:48:30] <arschmitz> kinda sorta similar to suzy
[08:48:36] <arschmitz> so that you could build your own grid
[08:49:27] <sfrisk> I know I get frustrated whenever I have to use the bootstrap grid
[08:49:32] <sfrisk> waaaaaaaay too much overhead on that one
[08:51:06] <michaelarestad> My favorite grids (Susy) are the build your own. A three column grid for a specific thing with your own custom markup is trivial to do.
[08:52:08] <michaelarestad> (not that it's super difficult to do without a grid system)
[09:29:24] <fossdevil> Hi all,
[09:31:06] <fossdevil> I am looking for a starting point. I guess i should start with resolving some bugs/issues. Can you let me know of any novice level bugs, just to get my hands dirty
[09:32:28] <arschmitz> fossdevil: there is not much that can be worked on right this moment
[09:32:42] <arschmitz> fossdevil: there will be shortly some work you can do to help with performance testing
[09:33:03] <arschmitz> once i land the necessary updates i will post a link to how people can help with that
[09:35:32] <bond007__> hey guys! I would like to work on the gsoc projects , to get acquainted with jquery code base should I start by fixing bugs ? If yes can some one point to easy-bugs which can help me quickly get started with development ?
[09:51:31] <sfrisk> bond007__: Chassis is still in early development, so there really aren't any bugs yet
[09:51:59] <arschmitz> bond007__: there will be shortly some work you can do to help with performance testing
[09:52:02] <sfrisk> however if you are interested in contributing I would suggest checking out the current issues at css-chassis.com, and start joining in on discussions in issues
[09:52:10] <arschmitz> once i land the necessary updates i will post a link to how people can help with that
[10:24:47] <prasunanand> sfrisk, I had a look at susy and neat.bourbon.io . I think I can create a similar custom grid creator. Is anyone else working on it.
[10:27:15] <sfrisk> prasunanand: Post in the issue how you plan to approach creating a custom grid creator so others can have input on the approach.
[10:28:08] <prasunanand> Sure, I will  do it shortly as I come up with something concrete :)
[10:28:38] <sfrisk> Sounds good. As I said before, we prefer to have some discussion and everyone to agree on an approach before someone starts coding something.  It ensures we're all on the same page
[10:29:16] <sfrisk> that being said, Grid is a lower priority than some of the other styling issues in Phase One
[10:29:41] <sfrisk> and you probably don't want to start working on a fork until the file structure PR lands
[10:31:03] <prasunanand> yes, I will create a rough blue-print of implementing it.
[10:31:35] <prasunanand> Can I help with the  styling issues in Phase One?
[10:31:59] <sfrisk> Once the current file structure issue lands, sure
[10:32:27] <prasunanand> cool (y)
[10:33:41] <sfrisk> miachaelarestad has a pretty good example of something like what we're looking for: http://codepen.io/MichaelArestad/pen/ogzZEN
[10:35:07] <sfrisk> Although right now we're only looking at base element styling - we're still finalizing decisions on the BEM naming convention
[10:36:17] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[10:39:23] <michaelarestad> Pretty solid article that showed up  fairly recently that involves BEM a bit. http://nicolasgallagher.com/about-html-semantics-front-end-architecture/
[10:40:33] <michaelarestad> The section on structured class names is pretty nice.
[10:48:02] <trailofdad> Hey everyone, just wanted to introduce myself. I'm interested in working on Chassis but i've still got quite a bit of reading to do. so yeah, hi!
[10:49:31] <trailofdad> I'm a web programming student living in Canada :)
[10:50:23] <trailofdad> and i have about 4 years of experience with design
[10:58:09] <arthurvr> Hi trailofdad!
[11:12:09] <geekman-rohit> Hey, saw the attract contributors issue: are we looking for a light basic front-end page yet? I would love to volunteer to make one
[11:13:38] <sfrisk> What do you mean by a light basic front-end page?
[11:14:01] <sfrisk> If you mean creating an actual website for Chassis, that's something we're putting on hold until the logo and colors for Chassis are finalized
[11:14:16] <sfrisk> not to mention it would be nice if our home page was actually built off of Chassis :-)
[11:14:50] <prasunanand> yeah
[11:15:54] <trailofdad> sorry if I missed anything there, had lost my internet connection :S
[11:17:10] <sfrisk> It happens
[11:17:40] <sfrisk> If you're interested in Chassis, but aren't familiar with SCSS yet, I would look into that
[11:17:44] <sfrisk> also BEM naming convention
[11:19:00] <geekman-rohit> yeah, agreed :)
[11:19:11] <geekman-rohit> It should be build of chassis
[11:20:21] <trailofdad> I am already familiar with scss but should do some reading on BEM.
[23:44:05] <fossdevil> arschmitz: Did you receive any updates that you were talking about yesterday?
