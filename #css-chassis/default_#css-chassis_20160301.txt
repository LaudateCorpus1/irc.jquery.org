[10:39:41] <thej> sfrisk could you please guide me to some beginner bugs to work on ? thanks
[10:40:13] <sfrisk> We actually have a meeting today at 2pm eastern time in #jquery-meeting where we'll be discussing Phase One items people can work on
[10:40:33] <thej> that's nice, will be there, thanks
[10:40:39] <sfrisk> Also commenting on open PRs (specifically Typography and Buttons) would be helpful too
[10:40:58] <sfrisk> since we're looking to land those two PRs today, and want to make sure we have taken everything into account
[10:41:28] <sfrisk> and those PRs should give you a good feel for our coding style and our jsass variable system
[10:41:50] <thej> sfrisk looking into them now
[10:42:07] <sfrisk> Awesome.
[11:45:52] <thej> sfrisk <p>'s are not styles in the typography scss file ?
[11:47:28] <sfrisk> doesn't look like <ol> or <ul> are either, just definition lists.  Bring it up in the PR, we'll create an issue for it during the meeting
[11:51:09] <thej> sfrisk on it
