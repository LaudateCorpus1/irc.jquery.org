[11:12:00] <michaelarestad> arschmitz: I pushed the changes to add/tables that I'd stashed.
[11:12:09] <noufal> sfrisk: can I start styling the elements which are not done by micheal
[11:12:10] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: awesome
[11:12:29] <sfrisk> I was going to create the issue I discussed making for you
[11:12:47] <sfrisk> on styling <meter>
[11:12:54] <noufal> oky
[11:13:08] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: just for the record i agree that as much as possible should be possible with out just but we 100% need to support the js styles as not an after though but as a #1 priority as well if we expect them to adopt us
[11:13:11] <sfrisk> so you can style that, and submit a PR for it
[11:13:26] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: i mean would you adopt a product that considers your needs a second priority?
[11:13:47] <michaelarestad> arschmitz: It's not a second priority. We're designing with both in mind. Which rarely happens.
[11:14:13] <noufal> oky sfrisk.
[11:14:17] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: sorry i was not saying it was i was only saying we need me make sure its not
[11:14:27] <michaelarestad> Yep.
[11:14:38] <noufal> Sfrisk one question. how to submit a PR? :(
[11:14:47] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: did we ever announce about dojo 2?
[11:14:50] <michaelarestad> I also probably need to test out and use jQuery UI stuff on a project in the near future.
[11:14:52] <arschmitz> sfrisk: ?
[11:14:58] <michaelarestad> dojo 2?
[11:15:06] <arschmitz> im guessing thats a no
[11:15:08] <sfrisk> hrm?
[11:15:17] <arschmitz> announce about dojo 2
[11:15:21] <arschmitz> in a meeting
[11:15:24] <sfrisk> I thought we announced dojo 2 in the meeting a few weeks ago?
[11:15:37] <michaelarestad> I may have missed that one. :/
[11:15:38] <arschmitz> michaelarestad: anyway iv been talking with one of the lead devs
[11:15:51] <sfrisk> might have just been the other meeting tho
[11:15:53] <arschmitz> and got a commitment from them to both use and contibute to chassis
