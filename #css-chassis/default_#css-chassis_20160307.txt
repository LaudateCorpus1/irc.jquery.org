[04:34:26] <Prasanna> I'm interested in GSOC project idea "Components for CSS Framework and Javascript Libraries". Where should I start? I checked out the getting started page but didn't sign up yet.
[04:36:37] <geekman-rohit> @Prasanna you can start contributing to chassis
[04:36:46] <geekman-rohit> Go through existing issues on github
[04:36:59] <geekman-rohit> Pick up something with milestone phase 1 and start working!
[04:37:21] <geekman-rohit> You can also participate in discussions here. Or in our weekly meetings
