[10:41:09] <slayslot> Hello, can anyone guide me in fixing the CLA error I have? https://github.com/jquery/contribute.jquery.org/pull/117 . Thanks
[11:10:22] <sfrisk_> have you signed the CLA?
[11:10:44] <slayslot> yes
[11:11:26] <slayslot> the problem is the first commit has different git config
[11:11:38] <slayslot> and I'm not able to change that
[11:11:42] <arschmitz> slayslot: right you need to fix that
[11:11:45] <arschmitz> yes you can
[11:11:52] <arschmitz> you need to rebase and fix it
[11:12:29] <slayslot> How?
[12:41:16] <slayslot> Phew, Thank you for that keyword @arschmitz :)
