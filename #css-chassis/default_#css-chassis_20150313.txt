[12:13:34] <ofalvai> hi
[12:14:11] <ofalvai> i have problems running the tests
[12:14:35] <ofalvai> "grunt perf" hangs at "Starting PerfJankie" and nothing happens
[12:15:08] <arschmitz> ofalvai: do you have the couchdb server running?
[12:15:30] <ofalvai> yes, I can access Futon
[12:15:41] <ofalvai> i'm on Windows btw
[12:16:02] <arschmitz> ofalvai: that may be the problem i dont have windows handy
[12:16:12] <arschmitz> ofalvai: can you do grunt perf --verbose
[12:16:16] <arschmitz> and gist the output
[12:18:29] <ofalvai> https://gist.github.com/ofalvai/ed3ecaba78ea0e8abb32
[12:19:09] <ofalvai> maybe cygwin is the problem?
[12:19:38] <arschmitz> it looks like browserperf is not starting
[12:20:04] <arschmitz> ofalvai: can you try doing npm install -g browserperf
[12:20:15] <arschmitz> then try again and see if it changes
[12:21:46] <ofalvai> it's called browser-perf, right?
[12:22:46] <ofalvai> it still hangs :(
[12:32:42] <ofalvai> i think i understand the problem. i started chromedriver.exe, but it uses a different port than what's defined in perfjankie.js
[12:33:21] <ofalvai> but it still fails, saying "aborted due to warnings"
[12:44:05] <arschmitz> ofalvai: you shoudl not be starting chrome dirver
[12:44:41] <ofalvai> yes, now as i'm digging deeper, i see that selenium is started and i shouldn't mess with it
[12:46:16] <arschmitz> ofalvai: just follow the directions in the readme :-)
[12:47:12] <ofalvai> in which readme? because the chassis readme says nothing about setting up these things, i though grunt perf would work automatically
[12:47:35] <arschmitz> it should
[12:47:41] <arschmitz> other then npm install
[12:47:52] <arschmitz> you should not start selenimum or chromedriver
[12:50:51] <arschmitz> ofalvai: if you have a selenium running already it will hang and fail
[12:51:30] <ofalvai> i don't, i just tried that once, now i'm doing everything as i should
[12:52:11] <ofalvai> now it throws ECONNREFUSED
[13:06:40] <ofalvai> ok, i give up for now
[13:07:12] <geekman-rohit> did you run npm install?
[13:07:28] <ofalvai> anyway, i'm here because of the GSoC, so running the tests is not important now, right?
[13:07:34] <ofalvai> yes, i did
[13:07:34] <geekman-rohit> and did it run sucesfully without any error messages?
[13:08:08] <arschmitz> ofalvai: feel free to gist the verbose output again and ill look
[13:08:12] <ofalvai> yes...but i'll try starting from scratch
[13:08:26] <arschmitz> ofalvai: i would restart too
[13:08:36] <arschmitz> also rm -rf node_modules
[13:08:43] <arschmitz> and npm install again
[13:08:56] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: did you ever get them running local?
[13:09:03] <geekman-rohit> yes
[13:09:07] <arschmitz> awesome
[13:09:20] <geekman-rohit> I am on windows, waiting for a 3gb download to finish
[13:09:26] <geekman-rohit> Ill try to install too
[13:09:36] <arschmitz> fun
[13:12:18] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz hes on windows? rm won't work ;)
[13:12:48] <arschmitz> lol will delete the directory
[13:13:18] <ofalvai> i'm on windows, but i use cygwin, and understand linux stuff :)
[13:14:15] <geekman-rohit> I'm going to try on windows7 right now,  always pray before I try stuff on windows ;)
[13:15:53] <ofalvai> meanwhile, i've set up the project from scratch (without any install errors), and nothing changed, still can't connect
[13:16:04] <ofalvai> i'll see if a restart helps
[13:21:07] <ofalvai> it's the same as before...i give up for now :(
[13:24:23] <arschmitz> ofalvai: gist are great :-)
[13:24:34] <arschmitz> hard to help if i cant see the full output
[13:26:38] <ofalvai> https://gist.github.com/ofalvai/cd16e644aba8d63b47a3
[13:27:05] <ofalvai> this is with the port set to 9515. with 4444 nothing happens after "Starting Browserperf"
[13:30:32] <arschmitz> ofalvai: did you change the port?
[13:31:15] <ofalvai> yes, in tasks/options/perfjankie.js
[13:31:24] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, which port does couchdb run on?
[13:31:33] <arschmitz> dont change the ports
[13:31:39] <arschmitz> everything is configured to work as is
[13:31:54] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: 5984
[13:32:11] <ofalvai> yes, but as i said, it hangs with the default 4444 port, i tried that many times
[13:32:37] <arschmitz> but that does not change the port the server starts on
[13:32:58] <arschmitz> just where its listening so thats why your getting a connection refsused
[13:33:06] <ofalvai> oh, i see
[13:33:09] <arschmitz> there is nothing there to connect to
[13:33:20] <geekman-rohit> starting perfjankie
[13:33:26] <geekman-rohit> is where it hangs on my win7
[13:33:35] <geekman-rohit> no movement after that
[13:33:50] <arschmitz> can you gist the output with --verbose
[13:34:47] <ofalvai> mine hangs two lines later (starting browser perf), but i remember the first time it was starting perfjankie
[13:35:37] <arschmitz> also what is the url that opens when you start couchdb?
[13:37:31] <ofalvai> what do you mean? when i start it on my machine? a window flashes for a few seconds, then disappears, and nothing opens
[13:37:33] <geekman-rohit> https://gist.github.com/geekman-rohit/bd3872e7029a47a27133
[13:37:52] <ofalvai> but the server is running, i can access http://localhost:5984/_utils/
[13:37:55] <geekman-rohit> a database is created on couch db css_performance.. but nothing after that
[13:39:06] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, we should try to see if selenium works on windows first, outside of our grunt task
[13:39:17] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: can you try doing npm install -g browser-perf
[13:39:26] <arschmitz> then do the same thing and gist the output
[13:39:31] <geekman-rohit> yes, will
[13:43:20] <geekman-rohit> my npm install fails
[13:43:23] <geekman-rohit> for node-sass
[13:43:50] <geekman-rohit> windows is a pain :P
[13:45:35] <arschmitz> ofalvai: i assume npm install worked for you
[13:46:45] <ofalvai> it did, but didn't help
[13:47:19] <arschmitz> iv never used selenium on windows
[13:47:37] <geekman-rohit> selenium is doing something strange localhost:4444 gives 403
[13:49:51] <arschmitz> http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub ?
[13:51:03] <arschmitz> or http://127.0.0.1:4444/wd/hub/
[13:52:16] <ofalvai> it works for me
[13:52:50] <ofalvai> i mean because the grunt task still hangs
[13:53:51] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, browser perf just worked fine.. direct use from command line
[13:54:02] <geekman-rohit> firefox open and test is run
[13:54:19] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: did you try grunt perf --verbose again?
[13:54:24] <arschmitz> after the global install?
[13:54:33] <geekman-rohit> I started clean, now my npm isntall fails
[13:54:36] <geekman-rohit> :(
[13:54:42] <geekman-rohit> for node-sass
[13:54:51] <arschmitz> ofalvai: can you remove firefox from the config and try?
[13:55:21] <arschmitz> ofalvai: one of the gists you posted only showed firefox failures
[13:55:56] <ofalvai> it's the same without firefox
[13:56:20] <ofalvai> i edited perfjankie.js, i hope that's what you meant
[13:57:00] <arschmitz> yes
[13:59:59] <geekman-rohit> works!!
[14:00:01] <geekman-rohit> problem is
[14:00:10] <geekman-rohit> chrome driver is different for windows
[14:00:12] <geekman-rohit> :)
[14:00:52] <arschmitz> ah well thats from npm
[14:01:01] <arschmitz> we dont specificy the download directly
[14:01:05] <geekman-rohit> the download is an exe file, I changed start-selenium-server.js to point to the chrome driver I downloaded
[14:01:10] <geekman-rohit> and all is working fine :)
[14:01:17] <arschmitz> oh i see
[14:01:31] <arschmitz> ill have to add a check for that
[14:01:59] <geekman-rohit> http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html?path=2.14/
[14:02:06] <geekman-rohit> this is where i downloaded the driver from
[14:02:32] <geekman-rohit> noticed the error when I ran only for firefox, that was working fine
[14:02:39] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: what is the file thats downloaded by npm in node modules
[14:02:45] <geekman-rohit> so I guessed it was to do with chroe driver
[14:03:15] <geekman-rohit> just "chromedriver"
[14:03:26] <geekman-rohit> looks like thats the linux/unix driver
[14:03:55] <arschmitz> ill look into it
[14:04:25] <geekman-rohit> nope, found the right file too
[14:04:26] <arschmitz> hmm says it should work for windows
[14:04:29] <geekman-rohit> its in the lib folder
[14:04:32] <geekman-rohit> for windows
[14:04:34] <arschmitz> ok
[14:06:16] <geekman-rohit> node_modules/chromedriver/lib/chromedriver/chromedriver.exe is the path of the chrome driver for windows
[14:07:00] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: thank you
[14:07:11] <geekman-rohit> nah, it was fun :D
[14:07:32] <geekman-rohit> and now i can test on firefox too :) which didnt work o my linux, so makes me happy :D
[14:08:30] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: oh right you were stuck with the incompatible versions there right?
[14:09:14] <geekman-rohit> yes, worked fine on my ubuntu VM, some problem with fedora installation I guess
[14:09:46] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: not super suprised its only fixed in the very newest osx version
[14:10:26] <ofalvai> so editing start-selenium-server.js should solve my problem as well?
[14:10:48] <geekman-rohit> lets hope that
[14:11:25] <geekman-rohit> edit the chrome driver path in start-selenium-server.js to node_modules/chromedriver/lib/chromedriver/chromedriver.exe
[14:11:33] <geekman-rohit> and try grunt perf?
[14:11:56] <ofalvai> "The environment you requested was unavailable"
[14:12:11] <ofalvai> for every test
[14:12:34] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: want to test a fix for me?
[14:12:42] <geekman-rohit> sure!
[14:12:54] <ofalvai> but firefox works, yaay
[14:13:00] <geekman-rohit> ofalavi, I was runing from cmd, didnt try from sygwin
[14:13:03] <geekman-rohit> cygwin
[14:13:09] <arschmitz> just a sec im going to gist a fix
[14:13:37] <geekman-rohit> why dont you remove chrome from perfjankie.js?
[14:13:45] <geekman-rohit> keep everything else the same
[14:15:32] <geekman-rohit> ofalavi, try that: keep everything else same, just remove "chrome" from the browsers array in perfjankie.js
[14:15:43] <geekman-rohit> keep all other settings default
[14:16:33] <ofalvai> it works
[14:17:22] <ofalvai> but why doesn't chrome work for me?
[14:17:28] <geekman-rohit> now add chrome
[14:17:38] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/5b259c6c3e65c1870a04
[14:17:39] <geekman-rohit> and make sure the path you set.. chromedriver.exe is right
[14:18:01] <ofalvai> serverOptions: {"Dwebdriver.chrome.driver=node_modules/chromedriver/lib/chromedriver.exe": ""},
[14:18:04] <ofalvai> like this?
[14:18:28] <arschmitz> ofalvai: your missing a chromedriver/ in there
[14:19:35] <ofalvai> oh...now everything works :)
[14:20:09] <arschmitz> ofalvai: want to try the gist above for me
[14:20:46] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, environment not available problem
[14:20:59] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: ok just a sec
[14:21:03] <geekman-rohit> though I don't see how :( the path is right, though absoulute
[14:28:25] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: ofalvai: https://gist.github.com/arschmitz/5b259c6c3e65c1870a04
[14:28:28] <arschmitz> that should work now
[14:29:12] <ofalvai> yes, it works
[14:29:20] <geekman-rohit> it does :)
[14:29:41] <geekman-rohit> umm I'll test on linux tomorrow ?
[14:30:26] <ofalvai> i can launch a ubuntu vm
[14:31:04] <arschmitz> awesome
[14:31:08] <arschmitz> that should work everywhere
[14:31:14] <arschmitz> ill fix it
[14:31:59] <geekman-rohit> that should, cool
[14:36:27] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz, any specific reason for repeating tests twice?
[14:40:55] <arschmitz> it takes an average
[14:42:52] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: makes the results slightly less finiky
[14:45:14] <geekman-rohit> understood, thanks :)
[14:45:37] <geekman-rohit> I'll do the BEM next week after I submit the GSOC proposal
[14:47:39] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: cool kendo is very high priority too
[14:48:12] <arschmitz> i think after that its more components
[14:48:29] <geekman-rohit> You said someone else was working on it?
[14:48:38] <arschmitz> ah right
[14:48:42] <geekman-rohit> prasun I guess
[14:48:50] <arschmitz> yup i think so
[14:49:26] <arschmitz> i just landed his other one last night so he will probably do it soon
[14:50:43] <geekman-rohit> yep, I got the notification..
[20:11:23] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] arschmitz opened pull request #54: Performance: Make path to chromedriver windows friendly (master...chromedriver-location) http://git.io/pdju
[21:16:22] <thebyteknight> hello
[21:16:48] <thebyteknight> @sfrisk
[21:17:06] <sfrisk> hellp
[21:17:08] <sfrisk> hello*
[21:17:57] <thebyteknight> Im going to apply for jquery foundation so I need some help.
[21:18:50] <sfrisk> what kind of help are you looking for?
[21:19:59] <thebyteknight> im applying for chasis - themeroller , so what you expect in that project?
[21:21:37] <sfrisk> For the themeroller project you would be using a nodejs backend. We're looking for something similar to what you can find in the mobile themeroller: http://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/
[21:23:25] <sfrisk> You should be able to change the SCSS variables to generate not only updated CSS, but also raw scss files.
[21:23:48] <sfrisk> it should also generate a json file
[21:24:29] <sfrisk> that has the variables that were changed that can be uploaded to the server to recreate the theme later, to help make upgrading chassis easier
[21:25:59] <thebyteknight> okay!!!!
[21:26:10] <thebyteknight> thank you.
[21:26:14] <sfrisk> no problem
[21:26:23] <sfrisk> hopefully that helps
[21:30:47] <thebyteknight>  Can I get some further help , if I get problem in coding???
[21:31:07] <thebyteknight> @sfrisk
[21:31:26] <sfrisk> part of the job of being a mentor is to help you out if you need it
[21:31:52] <sfrisk> prior to gsoc starting, and probably the first week or so, we'll also have to work out the wireframe and design of the page
[21:33:08] <thebyteknight> okay, I can do that.
[21:36:01] <thebyteknight> can i get your mail id??
[21:36:31] <sfrisk> my email is on github
[21:37:04] <sfrisk> also I would suggest if you haven't already, read through the issues on css-chassis, especially ones tagged Phase One, since that's what will be effected by the themeroller
[21:37:10] <sfrisk> and join in on conversations
[21:37:29] <sfrisk> also we have our weekly meeting on Tuesday, at 1PM EST in #jquery-meeting
[21:37:58] <thebyteknight> okay. Got it
[21:39:15] <thebyteknight> thank you very much!
[21:39:48] <thebyteknight> bye
[21:39:56] <sfrisk> no problem!
