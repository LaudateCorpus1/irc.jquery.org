[03:29:27] <alexeiTruhin> hi there!
[03:48:46] <alexeiTruhin> I've seen somebody wants to create a base theme for Wordpress.
[03:50:01] <alexeiTruhin> As in the gsoc Ideas-List, the task "Create a theme for a CMS that implements Chassis" has expected result "Expected results: A new base theme for either Drupal or Wordpress that is ready for use."
[03:50:32] <alexeiTruhin> could this task be split into 2? Wordpress and Drupal separately ?
[03:51:08] <alexeiTruhin> * I'm interested in Drupal, as I do my internship in a company which uses almost always this CMS.
[04:21:01] <alexeiTruhin> Another question, related to technical issues: Have anyone installed it on node 0.12, Win(8 x64) OS?
[09:06:28] <GreatDanton> sfrisk, ping
[09:13:26] <sfrisk> hello, GreatDanton
[09:13:28] <sfrisk> what's up?
[09:13:34] <GreatDanton> I got few questions
[09:13:45] <sfrisk> Okay. Go ahead
[09:13:45] <GreatDanton> for sending application
[09:13:56] <GreatDanton> what exactly do you want to see in it?
[09:14:09] <GreatDanton> I have been reading: http://www.di.ens.fr/~baghdadi/TXT_blog/5_advices_to_get_your_proposal_accepted.lyx.html
[09:14:29] <GreatDanton> but all of the applications got some kind of plan what and how they are going to do
[09:14:39] <GreatDanton> chasis is a bit different project imo
[09:14:53] <sfrisk> There are some project ideas we have though
[09:15:16] <sfrisk> Such as the theme roller, or creating a theme utilizing Chassis for a CMS
[09:16:05] <GreatDanton> then the other link that is in the ideas page: https://code.google.com/p/openintents/wiki/GSoCApplication
[09:16:16] <sfrisk> https://github.com/jquery/gsoc/wiki/GSoC-2015-Ideas-List
[09:16:26] <sfrisk> That link is a list of proposal ideas
[09:17:10] <sfrisk> and pretty much everything for Chassis on that list will be ready for development at the beginning of GSOC
[09:18:45] <sfrisk> so for your proposal, I would pick one of the Chassis items, and detail out your timeline for getting work done
[09:18:59] <sfrisk> some of the items, creating a theme especially, would involve helping to create UI coponents
[09:20:36] <GreatDanton> you mean timeline of coding, or timeline of preparation?
[09:20:42] <sfrisk> timeline of coding
[09:21:09] <sfrisk> what your deadlines are for various deliverables of the project
[09:21:25] <sfrisk> if you're doing the "create a theme for a CMS," for example
[09:21:32] <GreatDanton> hmm that's bit hard to predict :)
[09:21:40] <sfrisk> welcome to software development :-)
[09:21:52] <sfrisk> put into the timeline the UI components you would have to develop
[09:22:05] <sfrisk> such as pagination, drop down navigation, etc
[09:22:35] <GreatDanton> arent there more students doing same thing?
[09:22:51] <sfrisk> the theme?
[09:22:57] <GreatDanton> we haven't specified what someone will do
[09:23:07] <GreatDanton> yes
[09:23:56] <sfrisk> I've had a few people already give me draft proposals to look over
[09:24:59] <GreatDanton> and?
[09:25:25] <sfrisk> I have given them suggestions on where we're looking for more information
[09:25:30] <sfrisk> even though multiple students might be applying for the same thing - it's the proposal that has thought through the challenges and approaches the best that will get accepted.  Along with involvement on the current issues and weekly meetings.
[09:26:26] <sfrisk> As for developing a theme, there are multiple Content Management Systems out there, so it's possible we may accept proposals for different CMS, such as Drupal or Wordpress
[09:27:29] <sfrisk> We've also had people help contribute to performance testing, by submitting pull requests that test other frameworks
[09:27:42] <sfrisk> to help get familiar with our committing/PR process
[09:28:59] <sfrisk> Also for your proposal, it's helpful to have your IRC and github name included
[09:29:35] <GreatDanton> btw when are weekly meetings?
[09:29:43] <sfrisk> Also, even though proposal application starts tomorrow, I would highly suggest coming to the meeting on Tuesday at 1pm est.  That's when we make a lot of the technical decisions
[09:29:58] <sfrisk> I think it's listed also on the topic for this channel
[09:30:03] <sfrisk> they're over in #j1uery-meeting
[09:30:07] <sfrisk> jquery-meeting*
[09:30:17] <GreatDanton> i see
[09:30:44] <GreatDanton> xchat got some weird bar for channel informations
[09:32:05] <sfrisk> ahh. I use LimeChat, so it tends to post it every time I log in
[09:36:34] <exacs> Hello. I want to join into this project for Google Summer of Code
[09:37:15] <exacs> I like the idea of working on the Chassis website
[09:39:23] <exacs> but I am a newbie
[09:45:13] <GreatDanton> so what you want to ask exacs
[09:45:19] <GreatDanton> ?
[09:46:23] <sfrisk> I would suggest working on a theme over working on the Chassis website
[09:46:42] <sfrisk> since we'll be in the middle of working on creating a lot of the things next summer that will need documentation
[09:47:02] <sfrisk> and if you create a theme for Wordpress, for example, that could potentially be what we use for the website
[09:48:51] <exacs> Ok I see. And how many people will be working on this part of the project? The documentation, website, theme for CMS...
[10:01:42] <sfrisk> Hard to say right now - existing community members will be there working on UI components
[10:02:00] <sfrisk> we're still not sure how many gsoc students will be taking on though for Chassis
[10:02:24] <sfrisk> I suggest looking at the issues on css-chassis.com
[10:02:32] <sfrisk> contributing to discussions
[10:02:46] <sfrisk> and coming to our weekly meeting in #jquery-meeting at 1pm EST on Tuesdays
[10:12:07] <exacs> ok. Thank you. I will try to do my best!
[10:24:08] <GreatDanton> sfrisk, how many words the application should have?
[10:25:00] <GreatDanton> 3-4 pages or less?
[10:25:10] <sfrisk> as many words as it takes to say what you need to say
[10:26:14] <sfrisk> If you can send me a detailed and thought out proposal in less than 3 pages, then have it be less than three pages
[10:26:50] <GreatDanton> well reading past applications that are posted is quite interesting
[10:27:39] <sfrisk> What arschmitz and I are looking for is well thought out proposals that identifies possible risks and challenges, defines deliverables, explains what your technical approach will be, includes a timeline of your deliverables, plus whatever else you feel we might want to have
[10:31:04] <GreatDanton> okay one last question and I wont disturb you anymore today :D
[10:31:13] <sfrisk> Yes?
[10:31:48] <GreatDanton> what is the difference between: create pattern library of chassis components and Work on the Chassis website, adding demos ...
[10:32:05] <GreatDanton> isn't that the same ?
[10:32:12] <sfrisk> Pattern library is basically a page that has ALL of the components on it
[10:32:29] <sfrisk> basically something someone can go to to test to make sure they haven't broken anything visually
[10:33:00] <sfrisk> the Chassis website would be a different repo from css-chassis
[10:33:18] <sfrisk> and have more in depth documentation, multiple pages, use cases, etc
[10:34:28] <sfrisk> Okay, I'm heading out for about an hour, I'll be around to answer questions later.
[10:34:38] <GreatDanton> okay ty
[10:34:44] <GreatDanton> cya :)
[11:03:22] <dipesh> hello
[14:52:11] <chassis-commit> [css-chassis] prasunanand opened pull request #55: Performace:Kendo-ui buttons added (master...kendo-ui-testing) http://git.io/hvyD
[14:55:25] <prasunanand> arschmitz: I have also created the test for get-ui buttons "http://getuikit.com/docs/button.html". Should I make a PR for it
[14:57:13] <arschmitz> prasunanand: we dont just want any and every framework i thought you were working on kendo?
[14:57:54] <prasunanand> kendo added
[14:57:56] <prasunanand> :)
[14:58:13] <arschmitz> prasunanand: ah thank you
[14:58:15] <prasunanand> I was just asking
[14:58:20] <arschmitz> sure sorry
[14:58:32] <arschmitz> let me take a look real quick
[14:58:54] <prasunanand> Anything I can do for Performance testing. Please suggest
[15:00:01] <arschmitz> uikit looks fine
[15:00:08] <prasunanand> thanks
[15:00:11] <prasunanand> :)
[15:03:44] <prasunanand> arschmitz: Can u please suggest anything else that I can do for Performance testing.
[15:04:13] <arschmitz> prasunanand: id like kendoui mobile
[15:04:24] <arschmitz> after that we will start adding more components
[15:04:29] <prasunanand> sure
[15:04:49] <prasunanand> more component; where to start from?
[15:07:18] <arschmitz> you and geekman-rohit have been both working on this so ill split some between you two
[15:08:09] <prasunanand> sure
[15:08:27] <arschmitz> we will start with form components
[15:09:01] <prasunanand> Ok
[15:09:18] <prasunanand> like labels and input boxes
[15:11:39] <prasunanand> I will look into it
[15:13:13] <GreatDanton> arschmitz, ping
[15:13:28] <arschmitz> prasunanand: dont start on anything yet please
[15:13:39] <arschmitz> ill let you know which components to work on when we are ready
[15:13:44] <arschmitz> GreatDanton: yes?
[15:14:00] <GreatDanton> I was wondering if you can tell me more about styling components for js libraries
[15:14:05] <prasunanand> ok, right now I am working on Kendo-ui-mobile
[15:14:11] <GreatDanton> I am currently deciding what to pick
[15:15:20] <GreatDanton> I will get color pallet with the words be creative, or I will just implement js?
[15:15:35] <arschmitz> GreatDanton: not sure what your asking
[15:15:39] <arschmitz> there is no JS in chassis
[15:15:43] <arschmitz> and never will be
[15:16:11] <GreatDanton> oh my bad
[15:16:25] <GreatDanton> so I task is only to write css for modals, tabs, menus etc?
[15:17:11] <GreatDanton> so task is only to write css for modals, tabs, menus etc?*
[15:17:45] <arschmitz> yes
[15:18:04] <arschmitz> and you will work with people from various js libraries on how this should be done
[15:18:16] <arschmitz> for example this will be used by jquery ui and jquery mobile
[15:18:38] <arschmitz> and possibly Dojo
[15:18:41] <arschmitz> and other
[15:18:42] <arschmitz> s
[15:18:49] <GreatDanton> so colors are predefined?
[15:19:21] <arschmitz> colors will be definned by chassis base
[15:20:06] <arschmitz> this will be the markup and structural css
[15:20:36] <GreatDanton> that's what I was asking :), thanks for clarifying
[15:20:41] <GreatDanton> buttons go here as well right?
[15:21:53] <arschmitz> no
[15:22:05] <arschmitz> GreatDanton: that would be part of the css framework portion
[15:22:10] <arschmitz> no the ui-toolkit version
[15:29:34] <GreatDanton> I am sorry, but you lost me here
[15:30:07] <GreatDanton> I dont understand
[15:31:07] <arschmitz> GreatDanton: https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/wiki/Chassis-Roadmap
[15:39:40] <prasunanand> arschmitz, In kendo-ui-mobile the buttons have only one extra class other than kendo-ui  .
[15:40:36] <arschmitz> its a different css file though right?
[15:41:01] <prasunanand> arschmitz: km-button is the only extra button class . Only one css file is added extra for .km-button class
[15:41:16] <arschmitz> hmmm
[15:41:31] <prasunanand> http://demos.telerik.com/kendo-ui/mobile-button/index
[15:42:36] <arschmitz> i guess just add it as a variation to the regular one
[15:42:52] <prasunanand> ok, will do it
