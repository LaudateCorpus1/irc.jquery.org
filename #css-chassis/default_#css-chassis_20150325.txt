[01:59:44] <ronnel> Hi, among the pattern library, work on the chassis website creating an alternative theme, which would I be better off doing, considering the number of proposals?
[04:57:30] <ronnel> Would something like this do for the components demo? http://codepen.io/Ronnel/pen/yyZvoZ?editors=110
[04:59:17] <arschmitz> ronnel: good morning
[04:59:54] <arschmitz> ronnel: so thats not realy a "component" but it does at least give us some idea of your skill set
[05:00:36] <arschmitz> for a component what we meant was something like tabs, an accordion, a radio group, etc
[05:01:14] <arschmitz> just you dont need to make it actually "work" you can leave out any required js
[05:03:11] <arschmitz> ronnel: one comment i have right off is rather then all element/id combinations you should be using re-usable classes
[05:04:22] <arschmitz> ronnel: also if possible could use use full html rather then slim since we wont use any type of templateing
[05:27:02] <ronnel> arschmitz: thank you for letting me know, i will get working on it right away!
[07:53:01] <ronnel> arschmitz: would this be more like it? http://codepen.io/Ronnel/pen/RNvyYP
