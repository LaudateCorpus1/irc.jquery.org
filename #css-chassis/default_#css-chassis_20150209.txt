[10:58:48] <yask> guys I am interested in this project idea Chassis - Create a Pattern Library of Chassis components [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2015---Ideas-List]
[10:58:54] <yask> how should i continue?
[10:59:20] <yask> [as a contributor to this project for gsoc]
[11:01:05] <arthurvr> cc sfrisk ^^
[11:02:22] <sfrisk> Check out the issue on github, https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/11
[11:02:45] <sfrisk> also start commenting on issues in Chassis in general, and we have our weekly meeting Tuesdsay at 1pm EST in #jquery-meeting
[11:03:53] <sfrisk> also, arschmitz can probably back me up on this, but check out some of the components in jQuery UI and jQuery mobile, since those are some of the CSS components we'll be adding to Chassis.
[11:05:29] <yask> alright!
[11:17:21] <arschmitz> yask: Yup that issue is not really ready to actually do yet but everything sfrisk said
[11:18:16] <arschmitz> yask: im almost always around if sfrisk is not and either of us are happy to help or answer questions
[11:22:16] <yask> arschmitz: alright , i'll start exploring the idea
[11:22:24] <sfrisk> what arschmitz said
[11:22:28] <arschmitz> lol
[11:22:48] <arschmitz> so yeah just ask one of as and apparently the other one will say " what they said"
[11:22:54] <arschmitz> :-)
