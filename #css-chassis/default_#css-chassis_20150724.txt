[14:01:52] <ravenzz> howdy
[14:02:00] <arthurvr> hey ravenzz
[14:02:12] <sfrisk> allo
[14:03:31] <ravenzz> I didn't know that the jquery foundation hosts an irc server
[14:03:48] <arthurvr> Yep, we have a ZNC for the team.
[14:03:58] <ravenzz> that is linked to Freenode
[14:04:03] <ravenzz> cool
[14:05:25] <ravenzz> I was taking a look at chassis' repo
[14:05:44] <arthurvr> Cool! What did you think about it?
[14:06:18] <ravenzz> mmh I came up with a few "why?"
[14:06:45] <ravenzz> like why is not an org and modular?
[14:06:54] <ravenzz> why not use PostCSS ?
[14:08:58] <ravenzz> oops just read the "Modularity" point under the Goal section :)
[14:13:01] <arthurvr> Ha! :)
[14:13:27] <arthurvr> regarding postcss, at the end itâ€™s just a preference.
[14:15:11] <ravenzz> postcss is customizable and lightweight, one could get away with using http://cssnext.io
