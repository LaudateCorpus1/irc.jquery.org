[09:10:46] <sfrisk> mini gsoc party time!
[09:10:53] <arthurvr> yo
[09:11:01] <sfrisk> ping geekman-rohit, arthurvr, arschmitz
[09:11:19] <sfrisk> Today's topic: String Compression
[09:12:20] <arthurvr> Just use lzma. Itâ€™s super tiny anyways so itâ€™s easy to switch if you feel like we need something else
[09:12:54] <arschmitz> hi
[09:13:00] <geekman-rohit> i like arschmitz's suggestion too though
[09:13:14] <geekman-rohit> but lzma does look better to me
[09:13:19] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz your views?
[09:13:22] <arschmitz> what was my suggestion lol
[09:13:40] <arschmitz> i just looked at a couple and picked one im not held to any i dont even remember which one i picked
[09:13:51] <arschmitz> it was just an example of one that would work
[09:14:34] <arschmitz> So please if lzma looks better by al means use it
[09:15:22] <geekman-rohit> thats good, so we should go with lzma
[09:16:55] <geekman-rohit> we need to turn travis on for the repo now
[09:17:48] <geekman-rohit> sfrisk / arschmitz ?
[09:18:05] <arschmitz> sfrisk: has to
[09:18:12] <sfrisk> I thought you have rights to that?
[09:18:16] <sfrisk> (arschmitz)
[09:18:23] <arschmitz> maybe
[09:18:25] <arschmitz> ill check
[09:18:30] <sfrisk> it's same as chassis
[09:18:39] <arschmitz> i dont on chassis
[09:19:03] <arschmitz> or maybe i do
[09:19:06] <arschmitz> :-)
[09:19:08] <sfrisk> lol
[09:19:24] <arschmitz> ok so i can do that then
[09:19:55] <arthurvr> you both have the same rights (on the themeroller repo at least)
[09:20:16] <arschmitz> arthurvr: yes
[09:21:09] <geekman-rohit> only other thing on my list is https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.css-chassis.com/issues/13
[09:21:12] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: push a commit and make sure  travis.yml is calid and it will build now
[09:21:19] <arschmitz> valid
[09:22:01] <geekman-rohit> im doing a PR for adding more details to the readme and install instructions in a moment
[09:22:13] <geekman-rohit> Ill ping if it doesnt work
[09:22:57] <arschmitz> no never mind i dont have rights and i cant do it only sfrisk or scott_gonzalez can
[09:23:02] <arschmitz> im not an admin for those repos
[09:23:09] <sfrisk> I could have sworn you were
[09:23:12] <arschmitz> sfrisk: you can do it or you can add me as an admin
[09:25:12] <geekman-rohit> id love some discussion going on that issue https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.css-chassis.com/issues/13
[09:25:22] <geekman-rohit> coz i plan to do a pr for that soon
[09:32:15] <sfrisk> hey sorry, working with arschmitz to try and deal with Travis
[09:32:54] <geekman-rohit>  sure, that was all on my list anyways
[09:33:00] <geekman-rohit> thanks for your time!
[09:33:27] <sfrisk> looks like we need to ping scott
[09:33:31] <sfrisk> for the travis stuff
[09:33:38] <sfrisk> @arschmitz, have you looked at https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.css-chassis.com/issues/13 ?
[09:34:16] <arschmitz> looking
[09:35:11] <arschmitz> you dont need to upload
[09:35:33] <arschmitz> look at how the mobile one does it you just use a textfiled and post it as form data and then parse it to json
[09:35:54] <arschmitz> files should never actually be uploaded
[09:36:09] <geekman-rohit> yep
[09:36:30] <geekman-rohit> I realized that point too, I just kept it there in case we might need any backend support
[09:36:41] <geekman-rohit> in future
[09:37:17] <arschmitz> i would not worry about it i think parsing a text filed is all we will likely ever need for uploadishness
[09:37:29] <arschmitz> why cant i type field today?
[09:37:54] <sfrisk> I have no idea
[09:38:09] <geekman-rohit> um ? i dont understand
[09:38:13] <geekman-rohit> type field?
[09:38:26] <sfrisk> textarea
[09:38:30] <arschmitz> i kept typing it incorrectly
[09:38:32] <sfrisk> where you would in paste in the json I assume
[09:39:19] <geekman-rohit> oh he meant he did a typo in field
[09:39:53] <geekman-rohit> okay I still think we might need it in future if we do majot changes to api/ui but i agree with arschmitz for now
[09:40:07] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: how would that help
[09:40:28] <arschmitz> what more could you do with it on the server that you could not parsing the text?
[09:41:26] <geekman-rohit> we could do it in the browser always like you said,
[09:42:32] <geekman-rohit> but we could change multiple times.. i just thought leaving it to server would be easier in those cases
[09:42:56] <geekman-rohit> but any code will work both places with a small change, so I agree with you :)
[09:43:28] <sfrisk> I hope our variable names at least stay the same enough that mostly everything would load though
[09:43:35] <sfrisk> even if new variables won't be set
[09:44:56] <sfrisk> if an older json file gets uploaded, just leave any variables not specified in there at their default state for Chassis
[09:45:07] <geekman-rohit> arschmitz mentioned chassis will hava a json file
[09:45:12] <geekman-rohit> that lists variables?
[09:45:25] <geekman-rohit> if that is the case we could build things based on that
[09:45:33] <arschmitz> well not json
[09:45:35] <arschmitz> js
[09:45:37] <arschmitz> but yeah
[09:46:00] <arschmitz> when you build chassis it will generate a variables file
[09:46:18] <arschmitz> thats already in a PR
[09:46:46] <geekman-rohit> what i meant was instead of hard coding things at both ends, we could build the interface for variable changing dynamically at any side server/client
[09:46:53] <geekman-rohit> based on a json object
[09:47:16] <geekman-rohit> if chassis provides such an object thatd be freat
[09:47:18] <geekman-rohit> great
[09:47:29] <geekman-rohit> or we could have a .json file in themeroller doing that
[09:47:47] <arschmitz> geekman-rohit: are you saying you want to build the ui based off this file?
[09:47:58] <arschmitz> like dynamicly generated?
[09:47:58] <geekman-rohit> just the input fiels
[09:48:06] <geekman-rohit> fields*
[09:48:12] <arschmitz> ok so what you would do in that case
[09:48:39] <arschmitz> is you would depend on chassis and when the themeroller starts up on the server it would do a build and use the files from that
[09:48:52] <arschmitz> so it would get what ever version of chassis its currently on
[09:48:58] <geekman-rohit> yep
[09:49:16] <arschmitz> then for the upload it would just match the fileds from the pasted json to the one used to generate the ui
[09:49:20] <geekman-rohit> and to build i pass chassis a object? with variables and its values?
[09:49:21] <arschmitz> filling in the blanks
[09:49:40] <arschmitz> to build you pass an object back matching the one you built the ui off
[09:49:48] <arschmitz> but with the updated values
[09:49:48] <geekman-rohit> yep. exactly.
[09:49:57] <geekman-rohit> makes things a whole lot easier for us
[09:50:05] <arschmitz> the problem is
[09:50:18] <arschmitz> how do you know what type of filed something should be off the json
[09:50:23] <arschmitz> you still have to hard code that
[09:50:31] <arschmitz> it could be a select or a text input etc
[09:50:35] <arschmitz> color picker
[09:50:44] <geekman-rohit> so the themerolelr could maintain a json file
[09:50:56] <geekman-rohit> when we change chassis verion we change it too
[09:50:59] <arschmitz> what im saying is no matter what you need to hard code the ui
[09:51:25] <arschmitz> even if you build if off the chassis var file you in the end still need to hard code the fields somewhere
[09:51:42] <geekman-rohit> i would prefer if its in a json file
[09:51:47] <geekman-rohit> rather than in htnl
[09:51:50] <geekman-rohit> html*
[09:51:50] <arschmitz> thats fine
[09:52:02] <arschmitz> you will lose some flexability of layout
[09:52:13] <arschmitz> because it will have to be extreamly structured
[09:52:28] <arschmitz> to work out visually when it can change dynamicly
[09:53:07] <geekman-rohit> if it isnt working out, i can always take the dynamically generated latest markup and switch back to hard coded
[09:53:39] <geekman-rohit> i just like that idea is all, ill give it a shot and a few trials before implementing
[09:54:44] <arschmitz> im not saying it wont work by any means
[09:54:56] <arschmitz> just maybe not as well as you hoped
[09:55:14] <geekman-rohit> agreed
[09:55:48] <geekman-rohit> so in chassis based on ur latest PR
[09:55:59] <geekman-rohit> i all variables will be in files module wise
[09:56:03] <geekman-rohit> in the same folder?
[09:56:14] <arschmitz> no
[09:56:23] <arschmitz> they will be in the same folder as the css
[09:56:28] <arschmitz> scss
[09:56:50] <geekman-rohit> okay
[09:56:56] <arschmitz> and when you build it will create a combined on in the dist folder
[09:57:00] <arschmitz> which is what you will want
[09:57:21] <geekman-rohit> sounds good
[10:01:53] <sfrisk> meeting time in #jquery-meeting
