[11:25:50] <slayslot> anybody here?
[11:25:56] <slayslot> needed some help with my proposal
[12:04:58] <hiren_>  Do we need to write documentation for wordpress theme?  sfrisk arschmitz
[12:06:53] <arschmitz> hiren_: what do you mean?
[12:09:26] <hiren_> After completion of theme, do we need to write document about how to use theme & detail of theme.
[12:09:49] <sfrisk> Well it's a starter theme, so some documentation might be helpful
[12:10:28] <hiren_> Indeed True
[12:22:22] <slayslot> sfrisk arschmitz I had some doubts about the timeline
[12:23:31] <arschmitz> slayslot: timeline is really up to you want what you think is reasonable
[12:26:35] <slayslot> Yeah, that I can understand but my doubt is that as stated in the idea list that the theme must stick with the mutilayered approach of chassis
[12:26:57] <slayslot> so We're going to have a barebone started theme
[12:27:06] <slayslot> and a fully styles theme
[12:27:35] <slayslot> Since chassis is in Phase one which is the framework
[12:28:54] <slayslot> I would have to start for the fully styled theme after phase two is complete right?
[12:29:28] <sfrisk> part of the theme development is helping out developing UI components that would be needed in a wordpress theme
[12:29:33] <sfrisk> stuff like navbars and pagination
[12:32:34] <slayslot> okay, I'm not saying that I'll be idle until the phase is complete :P but just so I have clear idea of how to frame the timeline, the barebone theme starts after phase one and the fully styled theme after phase two,right?
[12:34:37] <sfrisk> phase two is going to be in active development over the summer, so it would be helpful if you helped out on items for phase two that are related to what you need for your theme
[12:37:45] <slayslot> I'll be happy to help.
[12:38:42] <slayslot> I'm still not quite able to frame the timeline :( can I assume that we'll be able to complete phase one by midterm?
[12:40:24] <sfrisk> phase one should be done before you start coding
[12:43:06] <slayslot> alright, that helps a lot. Thank you sfrisk :)
[13:54:21] <noufal> Sfrish arschmitz. What is the first approch to start styling the components?
