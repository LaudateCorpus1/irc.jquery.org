[06:22:25] <jzaefferer> sfrisk arschmitz: issues like this are getting pretty difficult to "read": https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/5 - I suggest updating the ticket description with a "spec" to keep things under control, or creating separate wiki pages to capture that information
[06:23:00] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yeah we have a few like that that are getting out of control long
[06:23:02] <jzaefferer> sfrisk arschmitz: of course wiki pages still have the big drawback of not providing notifications; might be okay if you ask people to post on the issue when the make (bigger) changes on the wiki
[06:23:31] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: also the issue that only team members can edit the wikis we had to lock them all down because of spam
[06:23:39] <jzaefferer> would also help to not dump tons of code into comments (gists are okay for that)
[06:24:00] <jzaefferer> well, that might be okay, only team can edit ticket body, too
[06:24:11] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: agreed the people that were doing that a lot there are no longer around too
[06:41:05] <sfrisk> what arschmitz said
[06:42:09] <sfrisk> I did tag items to try and make it clearer what items are related to what phase of chassis, but I agree, I think I might archive some times, to create a more technical issues of what needs to be accomplished, since some of those threads were used to have discussions on what direction we wanted to go in
[06:42:50] <sfrisk> but I am totally for taking the large code samples out of the issue list and just linking to it
[07:01:23] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sfrisk: the grid issue is much more readable now https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/5
[07:02:17] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sfrisk was thinking about even moving more of the discussion of the 2 proposed grids from cbracco and jsledgers into the gists that have the code now
[07:02:42] <arschmitz> then remove the comments and just have it all linked in the description
[07:04:20] <arthurvr> Thanks arschmitz
[07:04:22] <arthurvr> Much better
[07:07:35] <arschmitz> cleaned up https://github.com/jquery/css-chassis/issues/7 too
[07:11:46] <arschmitz> ok think i moved all the big code samples
[07:17:53] <sfrisk> Didn't we make the decision on that to just go with normalize?
[07:18:31] <sfrisk> Probably I should just make a PR to add in normalize, so we can close that issue.
[07:21:45] <arschmitz> the last thing in the issue was to check normalize to see if anything can be removed
[07:21:50] <arschmitz> based on browser support
[07:22:29] <arschmitz> as far as i know the answer to that is no but not sure anyone looked in depth when i scanned the comments before i didnt see anything we could be cause its not fixing bugs for the most part
[07:23:04] <arschmitz> but yeah one of us should just do a pr and move on for now i think
[07:23:33] <arschmitz> we can get it through npm or bower a\
[07:23:38] <arschmitz> then version bumps are easy
[07:27:18] <sfrisk> sounds good to me
