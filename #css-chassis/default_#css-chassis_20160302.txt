[07:41:24] <sherlcode13> I'm Tirth Bal . I 'm an undergraduate . I have good experience in working with javascript and css . I have intermediate skill level in angular js framework . I want to work on this project . Please help me to get started .
[10:39:13] <nashvail> Hey I am Nash (http://github.com/nashvail), I am new to GSOC and interested in contributing to Chassis. Read about it on the GSOC 2016 ideas page. How should I get started? I am assuming I'll have to write a proposal first?
[11:09:44] <thej> sfrisk are you merging the typography commit into master ?
[11:09:57] <sfrisk> once geekman-rohit makes his changes
[11:10:03] <sfrisk> he had something he needed to change before I did it
[11:11:23] <thej> ok, so I will work on a fork of his repo now?
[11:12:41] <sfrisk> That should work.
[11:13:10] <sfrisk> I should have the buttons PR merged in soon, I was just checking to make sure what I did last night looks okay
[11:13:44] <sfrisk> https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/31194468/Screen%20Shot%202016-03-01%20at%207.38.01%20PM.png
[11:14:03] <sfrisk> and the difference between the default state changes is a bit more obvious
[11:14:52] <sfrisk> Also I just realized, I don't think the text is centered vertically in the button
[11:16:13] <thej> looks great now and yes, its not centered vertically
[11:17:30] <sfrisk> okay, shall fix that
[12:04:26] <thej> sfrisk done styling p's , working on lists now, will send a pr tonight
[12:04:33] <sfrisk> sounds good
[21:13:05] <thej> sfrisk have we reached a consensus on consistent styling of outline ?
[21:13:40] <sfrisk> in the meeting we discussed the possibility of doing ":focus { outline: thin dotted; }"
[21:13:47] <sfrisk> so that the focus styling is consistent
