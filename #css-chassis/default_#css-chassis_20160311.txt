[03:58:58] <thej> sfrisk isn't styling of images included in phase 1 ?
[11:20:31] <nashvail> Is it that every time I change a jsass-var  in a .js file I need to run "grunt build" again ?
[11:34:33] <geekman-rohit> Any change you do. You must run it again
[11:36:42] <nashvail> not possible to create a task that can take care of that ?
[11:46:24] <geekman-rohit> There is
[11:46:30] <geekman-rohit> Grunt  watch
[11:58:59] <nashvail> When I make changes to .scss files, grunt watch runs, but not on making changes to the input.js file holding variables. Look http://i.imgur.com/m7jop23.gifv
[11:59:25] <nashvail> and thus I need to run "grunt build" to compile jsass-vars in scss variables
[12:01:40] <geekman-rohit> Mostly there are changes to scss files.. however you can bring it up in meeting and do a PR to fix that.
[12:02:32] <nashvail> Yes and about the meeting, it's on Tuesday right ? At what time ?
[12:04:00] <nashvail> Ok got it 1 PM ET
[12:31:31] <nashvail> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/UAATLsHK/
[12:31:57] <geekman-rohit> 2pm ET
[12:32:15] <geekman-rohit> nashvail
[12:32:35] <geekman-rohit> Time changed.. the status wasn't updated
[12:32:49] <nashvail> Oh! alright, thanks a bunch
[12:36:20] <sfrisk> Yeah, grunt watch on jsass vars does not work
[12:37:02] <nashvail> did you take a look at the pastebin ? srfisk
[12:37:14] <nashvail> sfrisk
[12:38:19] <sfrisk> yeah, submit a PR, it is something that needs to get fixed
[12:38:57] <sfrisk> also file an "issue" for it
[12:39:09] <sfrisk> that the `grunt watch` task doesn't rebuild the variables file
[12:39:52] <nashvail> Sure. terminal shows re-building but nothing really changes. I tried creating a different object for jsass-variables but that kinda results in some circular dependency like jsass  changes trigger scss changes which results in build running multiple times.
[12:39:57] <nashvail> Creating an issue now
