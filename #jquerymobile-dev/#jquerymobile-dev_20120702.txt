[02:46:44] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi: around?
[07:05:15] <gabejacobs> Is there anyway to load a page in jquery mobile and then automatically load a dialog (popup), when the page loads?
[07:05:57] <uGoMobi> I think that should be possible
[07:06:11] <gabejacobs> Any idea how?
[07:06:23] <uGoMobi> one sec
[07:07:29] <uGoMobi> see http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/methods.html how to programmatically open a popup
[07:07:47] <uGoMobi> then bind to pageshow event
[07:08:12] <gabejacobs> hmmm
[07:08:19] <uGoMobi> not what you are looking for?
[07:08:37] <gabejacobs> It very well could be, I'm just thinking about it
[07:09:15] <gabejacobs> so something like $('#messagebox').popup('open', x, y);
[07:09:25] <gabejacobs> if messagebox is a dialog
[07:09:41] <uGoMobi> a popup
[07:09:49] <uGoMobi> just to avoid confusion :)
[07:10:00] <uGoMobi> we have dialogs and popups now
[07:10:13] <gabejacobs> Oh, actually I wanted a dialog
[07:10:15] <uGoMobi> but yes, that should to the trick
[07:10:19] <uGoMobi> aha
[07:10:21] <gabejacobs> Something like this http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html#&ui-state=dialog
[07:10:40] <uGoMobi> data-rel="dialog"
[07:10:44] <gabejacobs> yeah
[07:12:33] <uGoMobi> what is it exactly that you want to achieve?
[07:12:49] <uGoMobi> you said "open dialog when a page loads"
[07:12:55] <gabejacobs> yes
[07:12:58] <uGoMobi> but basically a dialog is a page
[07:13:15] <gabejacobs> Well I want to ask the user if they want to "continue" or not
[07:13:15] <uGoMobi> just other styling
[07:13:44] <gabejacobs> How do you open a page programmatically then?
[07:13:50] <uGoMobi> on what event the dialog should open?
[07:14:20] <uGoMobi> changePage()  see http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dynamic.html
[07:14:29] <gabejacobs> Allright, I'll look at that thanks
[07:15:09] <uGoMobi> you are welcome
[07:18:22] <gabejacobs> Ok so I got changePage to work if I click a button
[07:18:26] <gabejacobs> or something like that
[07:18:35] <gabejacobs> but I don't know if it will work if there is no click event or anything
[07:20:15] <uGoMobi> also managed to get it to open the page as dialog?
[07:21:30] <gabejacobs> Yes
[07:21:51] <gabejacobs> Well I just created a button and called a function when the button was clicked to change the page
[07:22:17] <gabejacobs> Is there a way to maybe simulate a click?
[07:22:22] <uGoMobi> ok, you can options to the changePage function
[07:22:49] <uGoMobi> for dialog the option should be "role: dialog" if I am not mistaken
[07:23:11] <uGoMobi> when do you want the dialog to be opened? what kind of event?
[07:23:24] <gabejacobs> Just on load
[07:23:29] <gabejacobs> of the other page
[07:24:04] <uGoMobi> then you I think you could bind to the pageshow event of that page
[07:24:22] <uGoMobi> will copy some code here
[07:25:56] <uGoMobi> $("#initialPage").bind("pageshow", function () { $.mobile.changePage("#dialogPage", { role: dialog; }); });
[07:26:47] <uGoMobi> I might have missed a bracket, but it's about the idea
[07:27:23] <gabejacobs> Ok thanks I'll try it
[07:27:46] <uGoMobi> good luck
[07:28:11] <gabejacobs> Sorry last question
[07:28:58] <gabejacobs> So if I am doing some javascript and based on some math, I called function X. If in function X, I called changePage, it doesn't work. How do we fix that?
[07:29:09] <gabejacobs> Understand what I am saying?
[07:29:33] <uGoMobi> hmm
[07:31:26] <uGoMobi> you mean when there is some kind of if statement it doesn't work?
[07:31:33] <uGoMobi> but without that it does work?
[07:31:54] <uGoMobi> or didn't try that?
[07:33:27] <gabejacobs> let me show you some code
[07:33:31] <uGoMobi> BTW - I see forgot the quotes. I should be role: "dialog"
[07:33:44] <uGoMobi> sure
[07:37:11] <gabejacobs> http://pastebin.com/5kV43QgZ
[07:37:19] <gabejacobs> just used plain text so I could write easily
[07:37:25] <uGoMobi> k
[07:39:02] <gabejacobs> let me know what you think
[07:39:27] <uGoMobi> well I know alerts can mess things up
[07:39:42] <gabejacobs> Hmm, ok I'll take it out and check
[07:43:15] <gabejacobs> sorry still testing
[07:43:30] <Wilto> ’Morning, jQuery Mobile. What’s the rumpus?
[07:43:43] <uGoMobi> yo Wilto
[07:44:09] <uGoMobi> the rumpus?
[07:44:20] <uGoMobi> really learn a lot of new words here
[07:45:32] <gabejacobs> so weird, I took the alert out and its still showing me the alert…. ahhh
[07:45:49] <uGoMobi> yeah that's weird :D
[07:46:17] <gabejacobs> hold on...
[07:48:05] <uGoMobi> gabejacobs: might be useful to read the section about preventDefault and vclick vs. click http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[07:50:29] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I saw you were looking for me. Will be here for a few more minutes, but you can always email me (address is in profile)
[07:51:42] <gabejacobs> aha! I think I got it
[07:51:54] <uGoMobi> that sounds good
[07:53:05] <gabejacobs> uGoMobi: 		$.mobile.changePage("goals.html", { role: "dialog"; });
[07:53:10] <gabejacobs> thats correct syntax right?
[07:54:09] <uGoMobi> yeah seems correct
[07:54:53] <gabejacobs> Weird, that screws things up for me but this works 		$.mobile.changePage("goals.html") ;
[07:56:10] <gabejacobs> ah, you don't need the secodn to last semicolon
[07:56:15] <uGoMobi> and without that semicolon after "dialog"
[07:56:52] <uGoMobi> yup, my bad ... sorry
[07:58:00] <gabejacobs> Thanks so much for the help
[07:58:07] <gabejacobs> never thought I would figure that out
[07:58:17] <uGoMobi> no problem, glad you got it to work
[08:14:24] <gabejacobs> uGoMobi: to programmatically close the dialog? should I just changePage back?
[08:15:08] <uGoMobi> gabejacobs: you want to close it without user interaction?
[08:15:15] <gabejacobs> acutally nevermind
[08:15:29] <gabejacobs> I was going to put a button that said "close and continue"
[08:15:38] <gabejacobs> but it would be easier to just tell them to close it using the x
[08:16:01] <uGoMobi> yeah
[08:16:24] <uGoMobi> in case you do want to add a button... add data-rel="back" to the anchor
[08:31:12] <gabejacobs> uGoMobi: any idea why exiting out of the dialog would return you two pages back (instead of just 1)
[08:31:48] <gabejacobs> the page im on is like quizzes.html#quiz1012
[08:32:02] <gabejacobs> and instead of going back to there
[08:32:15] <gabejacobs> it is as if you are clicking the back button twice
[08:32:31] <gabejacobs> and it goes to trainers.html (the page the allows you to get to the quiz page)
[08:41:31] <gseguin> good morning jQueryMobros!
[08:41:48] <agcolom> Hi everyone, I'm on the train... That issue of going back two pages is something we had before and was fixed... Maybe worth looking at closed Github issues. The search is pretty good for that sort of thing.
[08:42:28] <gabejacobs> hmm ok thanks
[08:42:32] <agcolom> And don't forget your jQueryMosister!!!!
[08:43:03] <gseguin> sorry agcolom
[08:43:05] <gseguin> ;)
[08:43:08] <agcolom> Sorry I'm on my iPad, so I can't do that search....
[08:43:09] <gabejacobs> yeah it says it was fixed here, but still does it for me https://github.com/jtsage/jquery-mobile-datebox/issues/84
[08:43:10] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #84 on jquery-mobile-datebox (jomer; 9m, 5d ago): Close button in dialog box goes back two pages
[08:43:31] <agcolom> Date box???
[08:44:06] <agcolom> I'm talking jquery-mobile repo
[08:44:23] <agcolom> Hey gseguin :-)
[08:46:02] <gabejacobs> Any idea if it is me that is doing something wrong?
[08:46:21] <gabejacobs> I have a dialog on a different page that works without going two pages back
[08:47:30] <uGoMobi> hi Anne, hi Ghislain
[08:50:17] <agcolom> I can take a look when I get back... Is it a simple dialog or a dialog that opens up another dialog?
[08:50:26] <agcolom> Hey Jasper!
[08:51:05] <agcolom> if you can just pop the link here again, then I'll take a look in a few hours?..
[08:51:06] <agcolom> Off the train now...
[08:52:18] <gabejacobs> agcolom: a simple dialog, called through the changPage function
[08:52:27] <gabejacobs> that might be the problem
[08:52:47] <uGoMobi> gabejacobs: what version of the code are you using?
[08:53:12] <gabejacobs> jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js
[08:53:27] <gabejacobs> and jquery.mobile-1.1.0.min.js
[08:53:28] <uGoMobi> sorry, I mean JQM code
[08:53:33] <uGoMobi> ah ok :)
[08:53:52] <uGoMobi> want to give it a try with latest?
[08:59:05] <gabejacobs> Yes
[08:59:36] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/awoluv/edit#javascript,html
[08:59:49] <uGoMobi> in there you find the links
[09:00:59] <gabejacobs> strange, sometimes it goes back twice, sometimes only once
[09:01:39] <gabejacobs> seems like if I wait a bit, it will go back once
[09:01:48] <gabejacobs> but if I do it right away, it goes back twice...
[09:02:32] <uGoMobi> can you put your code it in that JSBin so I can have a look?
[09:02:50] <gabejacobs> Sure
[09:02:58] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:03:05] <gabejacobs> I have thus audio player and I think if I dont let it finish, it will go back twice
[09:03:10] <gabejacobs> but if I let it finish playing
[09:03:12] <gabejacobs> it works
[09:03:30] <uGoMobi> I see
[09:04:01] <gabejacobs> oh, the dialog box wont show up
[09:04:05] <gabejacobs> because its a seperate html page
[09:04:19] <uGoMobi> right
[09:05:21] <uGoMobi> you can put that code in another JSBin... just clone it
[09:06:12] <gabejacobs> Oh allright, give me a second
[09:06:16] <uGoMobi> sure
[09:09:26] <gabejacobs> uGoMobi: of course it works in jsbin, but not on the server
[09:09:44] <gabejacobs> It definitely has something to do with my page structure
[09:10:09] <gabejacobs> because I'm calling the dialog from a link that looks like this /quizzes.html#quiz10218
[09:10:40] <gabejacobs> so the dialogog goes to this page quizzes.html#&ui-state=dialog
[09:10:49] <uGoMobi> yes
[09:11:01] <gabejacobs> so then going back, brings it to trainers.html (when it should go to /quizzes.html#quiz10218)
[09:11:41] <gabejacobs> still really strage because if I wait for the audio to finish playing, it works
[09:12:29] <uGoMobi> what kind of audio api is that?
[09:12:45] <uGoMobi> can you put it in an iframe?
[09:13:16] <gabejacobs> its just a html5 audio tag
[09:13:20] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:18:28] <uGoMobi> gabejacobs: where did you put that audio tag? is it in the dialog?
[09:19:07] <gabejacobs> no, its in the other page
[09:19:22] <uGoMobi> ok

[09:28:07] <gabejacobs> didnt know that...
[09:28:18] <_|Nix|_> :)
[09:28:19] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:28:28] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_  how was your week off?
[09:28:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: My daughter decided to teethe ...
[09:28:50] <uGoMobi> aii
[09:28:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, fever, medicine, doctor, ...
[09:29:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Gotta love it :)
[09:29:38] <uGoMobi> so a relaxed week was just not supposed to be
[09:29:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: She's still a bit cranky, even though the fever's gone now. Had to give her some painkillers because she couldn't fall asleep from the pain.
[09:29:43] <uGoMobi> sorry to hear that
[09:29:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aaah, it happens.
[09:30:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I got another two weeks coming end of August, so maybe it'll work out then. We're flying down to the German side of Lake Constance (Bodensee).
[09:30:42] <uGoMobi> ah nice
[09:30:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I hope so :)
[09:30:50] <uGoMobi> been there
[09:31:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nice!
[09:33:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you see the new video and map popup examples?
[09:33:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... they look great ...
[09:34:19] <uGoMobi> I saw you had to "clean up my mess".... detroy ui-popup class :)
[09:34:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4595 doesn't look so great ...
[09:34:22] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4595 on jquery-mobile (DzenisevichK; 1w, 2d ago): Popup causes navigation back from a redirected page
[09:34:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP ... the problem is a lot of the jqm widgets ignore _destroy() ...
[09:35:03] <uGoMobi> yeah
[09:35:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's worse is, for example, slider installs a listener on $( window ), and doesn't remove it during _destroy(), so if you .remove() a slider, the listener stays there.
[09:35:27] <uGoMobi> we just think about creating stuff
[09:35:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Understandable, but leaky.
[09:35:51] <uGoMobi> yeah def
[09:36:02] <uGoMobi> this was an eye opener for me
[09:36:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We need to better integrate with the widget factory.
[09:37:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe the upgrading to 1.9b is a good opportunity to look into that
[09:38:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Even with the current widget factory, we're completely ignoring _setOption() ...
[09:39:03] <uGoMobi> hmm
[09:40:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I had a PR about that a while back, but we've postponed it until after 1.2 ...
[09:41:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is setOption just a cleaner way to do it or does it have more advantages? like easier to override?
[09:42:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: _setOption allows you to set this.options.XXX after the widget has been created.
[09:42:26] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[09:42:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For example $( "#myPopup" ).popup( "option", "overlayTheme", "e");
[09:43:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and most importantly: $( "#myWidget" ).widgetname( "option", "disabled", true );
[09:43:20] <uGoMobi> so that would solve the manipulating theme issue
[09:43:29] <uGoMobi> k
[09:43:32] <uGoMobi> interesting
[09:43:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That would make jqm widgets into real widgets, that can be changed after they're created.
[09:44:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Currently, the only way to change a widget option is to destroy the widget (which leaks) and recreate the widget with different options.
[09:44:22] <_|Nix|_> Terrible!
[09:45:42] <uGoMobi> and could a widget set the option for another widget with that functionality?
[09:46:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course. That's the point. Look at the way popup implements _setOption ... all widgets should do that.
[09:47:13] <uGoMobi> I was thinking about a new function getInheritedStyle (just like getInheritedTheme)
[09:47:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll show you a demo ...
[09:47:46] <uGoMobi> but setOption sounds much better
[09:47:49] <uGoMobi> k
[09:51:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/otf-options/tests/functional/option-test.html
[09:51:16] * uGoMobi is looking
[09:52:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's cool
[09:53:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's how it should be, and hopefully, that's how it will be in 1.3 ...
[09:53:07] <uGoMobi> issue that I was looking at is with buttons and forms in toolbars
[09:53:58] <uGoMobi> right now there is a lot of code to make those default to mini and more code to provide an option to override the default
[09:54:43] <uGoMobi> because of the ui-header/ui-footer in the selector they have a higher level of specificity
[09:55:15] <uGoMobi> and that causes most form and buttons to break when in a toolbar
[09:55:52] <uGoMobi> while we could just simply make the toolbar widget set the mini option for that button or form element
[09:56:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly!
[09:56:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This would give us another level of control ...
[09:56:23] <uGoMobi> yup
[09:56:58] <uGoMobi> we could get rid of a lot of css
[09:57:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, the good news is that the UI folks are planning to make it easier to implement _setOption, so when we grab the next version of the widget factory, we might have an easier time moving to this way of running.
[09:58:14] <uGoMobi> nice
[09:58:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They've already done a great job with _super, so now we can more properly derive from widgets.
[10:12:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: about the popup... I think we have to look at the max-height
[10:14:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see second example here http://ugomobi.github.com/popup/popup.html#page-b
[10:16:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think the 30px top/bottom tolerance should be distracted from the max-height, like it is done for max-width
[10:18:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I intentionally leave the max-height alone, because fixing the max-width will have an effect on the height. If you have a large enough popup, it /should/ spill over.
[10:19:35] <uGoMobi> ok I see
[10:20:06] <uGoMobi> was trying to set a max height for images inside popup
[10:20:42] <_|Nix|_> If I set max-height, then, if you have a large popup, you won't see the whole thing, or the inside of the popup will go outside the container, because there's no overflow: hidden set.
[10:22:01] <uGoMobi> I understand, for images it's different because we can make sure they scale. for other content i see the issue, yes
[10:23:17] <uGoMobi> maybe better to set a % max-height then for images, we just want to offer some basic styling for convenience
[10:28:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno ... IMO setting any kind of max-height is bad if you also set a max-width, because it introduces the possibility that you won't see the whole content.
[11:27:23] <agcolom> Hey all, I'm back :-)
[11:28:42] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ Hi Gabriel! for teething, sometimes you can find special teething gel to put on the gums directly that really help... Also if you believe in homeopathy, chamomilla can be good as well...
[13:37:58] <agcolom> ok, things seem dead calm tonight... I've added a couple of articles/apps to the resources page... should I update the CDN link (re note on basecamp) to jQuery 1.7.1 for 1.1.0?
[22:28:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Well, it seems Finns are more like: "Tough it out - pain builds character!" Such gels are not available. OTOH, they recommend painkillers. We gave her a baby dose of ibuprofen and Bam! Asleep 20 minutes later.
