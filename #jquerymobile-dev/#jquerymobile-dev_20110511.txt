[18:27:54] <StevenBlack> eddiemonge: Hi Eddie, I notice the current nightly build is labeled jQuery Mobile vNightly-20110509.  Dead chron?  Just checking.
[18:28:52] <eddiemonge> hmm let me check
[18:29:56] <eddiemonge> where?
[18:34:32] <StevenBlack> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js
[18:35:07] <StevenBlack> Css too, which points to the job.  http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.css
[18:35:35] <StevenBlack> ^^^ failed job
[18:35:38] <eddiemonge> oh latest, not nightly
[18:36:23] <StevenBlack> It's the "latest" links here: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/04/16/nightly-and-up-to-date-builds/
[18:37:05] <eddiemonge> lol actually im seeing 20110504
[18:37:49] <eddiemonge> hmm. thats a problem with the CDN because its right on the server
[18:38:29] <StevenBlack> Thanks for looking into this.  Am I correct in assuming that "latest" is supposed to be the latest nightly?
[18:39:24] <eddiemonge> yeah.
[18:39:52] <eddiemonge> there is latest and there are nightlies. nightlies are kind of like a log and latest is daily updated
[18:40:45] <StevenBlack> Perfect.  I'll try keeping an eye on the freshness of these files going forward.
[18:41:00] <StevenBlack> (Stepping out)
[18:41:06] <eddiemonge> actually they should be up to date
[18:41:15] <eddiemonge> but it looks like we are having a server replication issue

[21:24:41] <StevenBlack> ===============
[21:25:33] <StevenBlack> Confirming ?m1605 as a reproducible bug.  Can someone please set the status on that one?  It's a blocker.
