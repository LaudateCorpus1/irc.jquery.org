[02:51:46] <danielvdende> uGoMobi: we have a few questions about the suggested work we were going to do for the performance measurement of the upcoming release. Would you be able to answer those right now? Or would you prefer some other time?
[03:17:52] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: hi Daniel
[03:18:56] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: I am extremely busy at the moment, sorry.... have to finish a tutorial and talk for the Dutch Mobile Conference today
[03:19:52] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: maybe _|Nix|_, arschmitz or johnbender can help you though
[03:21:22] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: arschmitz (east coast) and johnbender (west coast) are in the US so they are not here yet
[03:22:07] <danielvdende> uGoMobi: ok, no problem :). 
[03:23:06] <danielvdende> _|Nix|_: would you be able to help us out? Do you know what we're trying to do (don't know if uGoMobi has discussed this with you or you have read some of the previous messages?)
[03:23:45] <uGoMobi> I will be at DMC tomorrow and friday... I might be around this weekend, but have to prepare my trip to the US as well
[03:24:07] <uGoMobi> so I hope the others can help you
[03:26:02] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: do you have a list with questions? if no one is available to help now, I can post your question on the team message board
[03:27:00] <danielvdende> uGoMobi: yes we do have a list of questions. Should we post them here or somewhere else?
[03:27:32] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: I'll send you a DM via Twitter with my e-mail
[03:27:47] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: so you can mail them to me
[03:31:07] <danielvdende> uGoMobi: great! Thanks! :)
[06:30:41] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[06:30:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good morning
[06:31:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i was looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6042#issuecomment-18973520
[06:32:02] <arschmitz> and im not sure if im understanding what they are trying to do correctly but if i am they are just plain doing that wrong lol 
[06:34:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: from what you saw am i understanding their situation correctly?
[06:37:20] <uGoMobi> morning
[06:38:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: your busy the next 2 weeks
[06:38:37] <arschmitz> conferences ahoy!
[06:41:25] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: sorry, connection problems
[06:41:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: irc trouble this morning
[06:41:30] <arschmitz> ha yeah i figured
[06:41:49] <uGoMobi_> I think it was my internet connection
[06:41:55] <arschmitz> ahh
[06:42:01] <uGoMobi_> couldn't log with any client
[06:42:12] <arschmitz> thats something im lucky with my office has a fiber backbone
[06:42:18] <uGoMobi_> nice
[06:42:20] <arschmitz> so pretty rare to have any issues
[06:42:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: your pretty busy the next 2 weeks
[06:42:59] <arschmitz> conferences
[06:43:06] <uGoMobi_> yeah

[06:43:38] <arschmitz> i wanted to do a talk for portland
[06:43:46] <uGoMobi_> flight is on tuesday
[06:44:00] <arschmitz> but the deadline for submissions was like a week after the baby and i spaced it lol'
[06:44:16] <arschmitz> yeah im flying tuesday also
[06:44:22] <uGoMobi_> yeah other things at your mind
[06:44:23] <arschmitz> mine is a lot shorter though
[06:44:51] <uGoMobi> not sure how long my flight is actually
[06:45:14] <uGoMobi> I leave 8.30am and arrive 8.30pm and 9 hrs time difference
[06:45:18] <uGoMobi> you do the math :)
[06:45:26] <arschmitz> fun
[06:45:30] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:45:32] <arschmitz> hey i think i get there the same time
[06:45:42] <arschmitz> not as bad as when i went to korea at least
[06:45:49] <uGoMobi> oh for sure
[06:46:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i get to the portland airport at 8:40
[06:46:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hehe I arrive at 8.41pm :)
[06:46:54] <arschmitz> me too!
[06:47:09] <arschmitz> you dont have a layover in philadelphia do you?
[06:47:11] <uGoMobi> just saw that my plane departs 10.50am not 8.30am
[06:47:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I do
[06:47:22] <uGoMobi> hehe same plane!
[06:47:23] <arschmitz> ha we are on same plane
[06:47:24] <uGoMobi> US Airways
[06:47:29] <uGoMobi> cool
[06:47:55] <arschmitz> yeah thats funny guess ill be seeing you before portland ha ha
[06:48:04] <uGoMobi> I guess so
[06:48:11] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:48:47] <uGoMobi> wow not sure if it was my internet connection... everyone has IRC issues
[06:48:54] <arschmitz> seems like something is up with irc this morning for sure
[06:49:04] <arschmitz> yeah i had my client weird out earlier too
[06:50:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you happen to see my comment on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6042#issuecomment-18973520 ?
[06:50:45] <arschmitz> just wondering if you think im understanding their situation correctly
[06:51:12] <uGoMobi> reading
[06:52:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think you understand it correctly
[06:52:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure why they want it though
[06:52:57] <arschmitz> sweet so not a bug 
[06:53:46] <arschmitz> yeah i dunno either but oh well people do weird stuff
[06:54:26] <uGoMobi> lol yeah
[06:54:28] <arschmitz> but i think im going to close since it does not appear to be a bug
[06:54:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did might be something we have to document thought
[06:54:56] <arschmitz> it is / was documented somewhere
[06:54:58] <uGoMobi> so but people now they shouldn't do it like that
[06:55:12] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:55:20] <arschmitz> it was part of my talk in korea so i got it from somewhere lol
[06:55:25] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:55:26] <arschmitz> but might have been in old docs
[06:56:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you can find it here http://view.jquerymobile.com/old-docs/ you can point to that when closing the ticket
[06:56:18] <arschmitz> sadly i dont think we did as good a job as we had hoped in making sure everything found a new home
[06:56:22] <uGoMobi> and open ticket at API docs repo if it's missing there
[06:56:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think its something that should probably be a demo / faq seems to be the place that would make the most sense
[06:56:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, specially stuff about in the old "pages" section isn't in the new docs yet
[06:56:58] <arschmitz> because its not really part of the api
[06:57:16] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:57:36] <arschmitz> well as long as its documented that pagebeforechange recieves that data object 
[06:57:43] <arschmitz> need to check that
[06:59:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually its quite nicely documented in the current api and that you can modify the params http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagebeforechange/
[07:01:02] <uGoMobi> great
[07:33:50] <toddmparker> morning
[07:57:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker: morning
[08:21:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Good morning!
[08:21:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: morning
[08:22:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: out of curiosity you dont have a layover in philidelphia on your way to portland do you?
[08:22:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lemme see ...
[08:23:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No, I'm hopping over in Chicago.
[08:24:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool just curious uGoMobi and i are on the same flight into portland
[08:24:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It'll be two firsts for me. Never been to O'Hare, nor Heathrow (my other "separator").
[08:26:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's awesome!
[08:26:45] <arschmitz> yeah iv never been through philidelphia airport either 
[08:26:50] <arschmitz> no idea its name lol
[08:26:57] <arschmitz> and never been to oregon 
[08:27:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Portland is great! Pretty laid back ...
[08:27:52] <arschmitz> nice
[08:27:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, and you've /got/ to check out Powell's book store. Wow! Chapters looks like a leaky tent by comparison.
[08:28:26] <arschmitz> is chapters a book store lol im not familier?
[08:28:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wow! There's no Chapters in the US ... OK ... must be a Canadian thing ...
[08:29:02] <arschmitz> lol there are not many bookstores left in the us at all ha ha ha
[08:29:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ummmm ... Coles?
[08:29:16] <arschmitz> most fo the big ones have gone under
[08:29:33] <arschmitz> coles nope know kohls lol but thats not books lol
[08:30:21] <arschmitz> the big ones around here are all out of business we had borders, mr paperback, and a few others but they are gone
[08:30:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: K, well, this one is awesome! The paragon of book stores. I'm pretty sure they have a copy of the very first book to come off Gutenberg's press :)
[08:31:02] <arschmitz> nice
[08:31:17] <arschmitz> i do a bit of antique book collecting so ill have to check it out for sure
[08:31:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... and I'm looking forward to an Arthur C. Clarke harvest.
[08:32:09] <arschmitz> cool
[08:32:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I bought his collected short stories two years ago. My jaw still hits the floor on a regular basis as I read those stories.
[08:32:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This guy envisioned SMS in, like, 1953.
[08:32:44] <arschmitz> i have not actually read as much of his stuff as id like 
[08:33:35] <arschmitz> it is amazing how truely visionary sci fi writers can be though
[08:34:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: though what is sms other then a wireless telegram the oldest electronic comunication there is
[08:36:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I highly recommend it. There's of course a lot of less-than-earth-shattering stuff, but some stories you just put the book down, and stare a hole into the air for, like, 5 minutes just stumped ...
[08:36:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Naw ... that was a very specific description: A small device worn around the upper arm, walking through the park, and BAM! incoming message.
[08:37:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No big antenna, no operator, none of that.
[08:38:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Anyway ... that's just an example. That putting-the-book-down-in-helpless-astonishment kind of feeling has hit me at least 5-6 times while reading that book.
[08:38:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, and not to mention the seeds for Star Trek and Earth 2.
[08:40:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Anyway, I oughta get back to fixing unit tests :) I'll have time to return the book soon enough ... I have two stopovers on my way there ...
[09:36:41] <_|Nix|_> Woah! uGoMobi is not here! Insane!
[09:36:58] <_|Nix|_> IRC really is fux0red today ...

[10:03:40] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: are you around to look at jQuery Mobile testing stuff? Porting Jenkins jobs, for now
[10:07:25] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: would you be around a little later
[10:07:34] <arschmitz> i was heading to lunch in a few minutes
[10:07:56] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: probably

[10:08:37] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: actually i have about 20 minutes right now too
[10:09:06] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:09:09] <jzaefferer> take a look at http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/
[10:09:25] <jzaefferer> everything else is, more or less, ported to http://jenkins.jquery.com/
[10:09:57] <jzaefferer> the last two there haven't passed a single time in several months, so those don't seem to have much value right now
[10:10:09] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: on that infra issue you just commented on
[10:10:20] <jzaefferer> for the branch preview: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/186
[10:10:25] <arschmitz> we dont use that for branch preview anymore i dont believe 
[10:11:11] <jzaefferer> hu
[10:11:12] <jzaefferer> okay
[10:11:17] <jzaefferer> if that's the case, we can just disable it
[10:11:21] <jzaefferer> can you verify that?
[10:11:29] <jzaefferer> disable and close my ticket
[10:11:41] <arschmitz> yup ill look right now but we switched to a grunt based one im almost positive
[10:11:59] <arschmitz> when we switched to using view.jquerymobile.com
[10:12:35] <jzaefferer> well, that index page actually looks like the one on view.jqueryui.com
[10:12:36] <arschmitz> gseguin: you around
[10:12:41] <arschmitz> it is the same
[10:12:43] <gseguin> I am
[10:12:47] <gseguin> 's up?
[10:13:07] <arschmitz> we dont use the jenkins job for branch preview any more right
[10:13:14] <arschmitz> thats old
[10:13:36] <gseguin> lemme check what it does
[10:13:46] <jzaefferer> it still runs 10 times a day or something
[10:14:04] <jzaefferer> every five minutes??
[10:14:16] <jzaefferer> or once per hour
[10:14:20] <jzaefferer> silly cron format
[10:14:34] <arschmitz> yeah we have a cron every 5 minutes for view now thats the same as ui
[10:16:29] <gseguin> yeah I'm pretty sure we don't need it
[10:16:38] <arschmitz> yeah its all part of the build now
[10:16:47] <gseguin> jzaefferer: you're doing some housecleaning on Jenkins?
[10:17:23] <gseguin> while you're at it could you install the cobertura code coverage plugin ?
[10:17:28] <jzaefferer> gseguin: moving to a new server mostly
[10:17:34] <jzaefferer> but also cleaning up while doing that
[10:18:08] <jzaefferer> well, I'm gonna delete that job from the new server and disable it on the old one
[10:18:14] <jzaefferer> just to be sure we're not loosing anything
[10:18:21] <gseguin> sounds good
[10:18:23] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: sounds good 
[10:18:41] <gseguin> jzaefferer: the new one is jenkins.jquery.org ?
[10:18:50] <jzaefferer> http://jenkins.jquery.com/
[10:19:11] <jzaefferer> gseguin: installing new stuff is possible, sure, but I'd like to finish the move first
[10:19:18] <jzaefferer> see also https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/176
[10:19:23] <gseguin> even though it's not limited to core?
[10:19:31] <jzaefferer> can you create an infrastructure issue?
[10:19:43] <jzaefferer> what do you mean, limited to core?
[10:20:04] <gseguin> jQuery Mobile will use it as well
[10:20:31] <gseguin> I was under the impression that jquery.com was for all things jquery core related
[10:21:02] <gseguin> not that I have strong feelings about it, just wondering
[10:21:37] <jzaefferer> dunno
[10:21:41] <jzaefferer> wasn't my idea
[10:21:47] <jzaefferer> shouldn't matter
[10:22:04] <jzaefferer> arschmitz gseguin: this job needs an update: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Git/configure
[10:22:47] <jzaefferer> instead of piling more bash on top, how about a separate grunt task that puts these git files into a single folder? then we can just scp those files and iterate over them, like QUnit does: http://jenkins.jquery.com/job/QUnit/configure
[10:23:00] <jzaefferer> this is much simpler:
[10:23:05] <jzaefferer> grunt build-git:${GIT_COMMIT}
[10:23:05] <jzaefferer> scp dist/* jqadmin@code.origin.jquery.com:/var/www/code.origin.jquery.com/htdocs/qunit/
[10:23:05] <jzaefferer> cd dist
[10:23:06] <jzaefferer> for i in * ; do curl -s http://code.origin.jquery.com/qunit/$i?reload ; done
[10:23:13] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i dont have a name / pass for jenkins
[10:23:27] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: can you register? I'll give you access then
[10:23:38] <arschmitz> sure
[10:24:59] <arschmitz> hmm says i have a user name already 
[10:25:02] <jzaefferer> gseguin: looks like you don't have an account either, same deal: register, and I can hand out access
[10:25:34] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: well, can you get back inside with that one?
[10:25:53] <arschmitz> im trying but its not accepting any password i have ever used
[10:26:13] <gseguin> jzaefferer: done
[10:26:35] <gseguin> jzaefferer: can you also delete the ghislain user?
[10:27:04] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: looks like your "user" was auto-created based on a commit
[10:27:07] <jzaefferer> weird
[10:27:11] <arschmitz> ah ok
[10:27:21] <arschmitz> well no idea what its password would be then lol
[10:27:45] <arschmitz> iv tried everything i would ever use
[10:29:42] <jzaefferer> gseguin: this user management sucks. I don't know how to delete the "ghislain" user
[10:30:09] <gseguin> jzaefferer: no worries, just give access to user "gseguin"
[10:30:17] <gseguin> and I won't login with "ghislain"
[10:31:25] <jzaefferer> gseguin: okay, gseguin has access now
[10:33:10] <gseguin> jzaefferer: I'll work on creating a "build-git" task
[10:33:20] <gseguin> unless arschmitz beats me to it
[10:33:42] <gseguin> arschmitz: I probably won't get to it until the weekend or next week
[10:33:53] <jzaefferer> gseguin: okay, great. Will be more sane to just copy a dir then maintaining that list inside Jenkins
[10:34:54] <jzaefferer> once that task is in place, we can update the jenkins job
[10:35:04] <jzaefferer> once we've moved enough jobs, update the GitHub commit hook
[10:35:50] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: i agree that will be much more sane
[10:36:07] <arschmitz> gseguin: ill let you know if i do but im not sure i will beat you to it :)
[10:36:15] <gseguin> the reason why I didn't do a scp dist/* was just in case there are files in dist that we don't want on the CDN
[10:36:47] <jzaefferer> gseguin: yeah, that makes sense. That happens for QUnit since there are no other files right now, but for UI it wouldn't work
[10:37:04] <jzaefferer> looking at the phantom master build: http://jenkins.jquery.com/view/Disabled/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/configure
[10:37:14] <jzaefferer> why is there a separate checkout?
[10:37:40] <gseguin> however I could create a grunt task that outputs *-git files and scp dist/*-git 
[10:37:41] <jzaefferer> that doesn't make sense to me, since the Jenkins job already maintains a Git repo
[10:38:22] <gseguin> oh I have no idea
[10:38:43] <jzaefferer> gseguin: if that matches the final names, it seems good. Otherwise put them in dist/git/ and scp from there?
[10:39:17] <jzaefferer> its also odd that everything is executed in a separate shell. Those get executed with -e, so any error should abort the script
[10:39:31] <gseguin> jzaefferer: if I have a build-git target it will output properly named files
[10:39:47] <jzaefferer> gseguin: right
[10:40:04] <gseguin> so no need to put them in a subdir I think
[10:40:42] <gseguin> for the Phantom job I think it's disabled
[10:40:52] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: the failing tests you wanted me to look at on swarm.jquery.org 
[10:40:53] <gseguin> we do that on TravisCI 
[10:41:28] <arschmitz> the phantom master job is missing grunt its probably still using the old version and we upgraded
[10:41:31] <jzaefferer> gseguin: this didn't get disabled: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/
[10:41:54] <arschmitz> and yeah we use travis now too
[10:41:58] <jzaefferer> so you need those jenkins jobs for phantom testing?
[10:42:09] <jzaefferer> *don't need
[10:42:13] <arschmitz> the test swarm one has been disabled for a long time
[10:42:25] <jzaefferer> that never got disabled either
[10:42:30] <jzaefferer> it just doesn't work
[10:42:37] <arschmitz> oh well it has not run in 9 months lol
[10:42:38] <jzaefferer> or rather, never succeeds
[10:43:01] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: testswarm has not run in 9 months not even to fail
[10:43:01] <jzaefferer> well, 6 months ago it ran, 9 months ago it succeeded ;)
[10:43:09] <arschmitz> oh yeah sorry 
[10:43:17] <jzaefferer> whatever
[10:43:21] <jzaefferer> obviously not in use
[10:43:25] <arschmitz> so im thinking we dont need that lol
[10:43:27] <arschmitz> exactly
[10:43:34] <jzaefferer> well, we can kill it for now
[10:43:36] <arschmitz> so i think both of those are relics
[10:43:41] <gseguin> yeah we don't need it
[10:43:55] <jzaefferer> I'd like to get back to that though, since phantom provides very little coverage in terms of browsers
[10:44:46] <jzaefferer> so once that new build-git task is there, we can update the commit hook
[10:44:53] <jzaefferer> no need for any of the others
[10:45:08] <arschmitz> yeah i think so
[10:45:12] <jzaefferer> then shut off the old server and revisit testing mobile on testswarm at some point in the future
[10:45:20] <arschmitz> yup
[10:45:27] <arschmitz> 1.1 stable we dont need any more either
[10:45:36] <arschmitz> there wont be any more 1.1.x releases
[10:45:48] <arschmitz> i think the same with 1.2
[10:45:55] <gseguin> jzaefferer: I'll eventually add one for test coverage
[10:46:11] <gseguin> because TravisCI doesn't do that
[10:46:16] <jzaefferer> right
[10:46:40] <jzaefferer> well, we don't need separate jobs for everything. There can be one that builds, runs basic tests, deploys to CDN, submits to TestSwarm...
[10:46:47] <jzaefferer> That's what the jQuery UI job does
[10:47:09] <jzaefferer> would be great if you could get that task done soon
[10:47:13] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: iv gota run now but ill be back in about an hour
[10:48:26] <jzaefferer> since that's the one remaining job, I'd like to move that over asap
[12:42:34] <arschmitz> gseguin: you still here?
[13:14:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you here?
[13:17:17] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: yes
[13:17:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: so iv been looking into the issue with the order files are concanted in
[13:19:07] <arschmitz> looks like this is possible it will just require a little work and dilagence on our part
[13:19:47] <arschmitz> we need to make the index.php match the builder
[13:19:49] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:19:56] <arschmitz> because the builder is not changeable
[13:20:08] <uGoMobi> already thought that was the case
[13:20:26] <arschmitz> i dont believe so 
[13:20:27] <uGoMobi> and jquery.mobile.js should match as well
[13:20:31] <arschmitz> yes
[13:20:50] <arschmitz> the builder is by module then by alpha order within that
[13:21:08] <arschmitz> the modules are also in alpha order
[13:22:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they deff DO NOT match right now im looking
[13:22:11] <uGoMobi> I know
[13:22:14] <arschmitz> they are not even similar lol
[13:22:16] <uGoMobi> I mentioned that before
[13:22:35] <arschmitz> so basicly some one ( i can do it when i get a few minutes )
[13:22:35] <uGoMobi> we also have to look at CSS vs JS
[13:22:59] <arschmitz> needs to go through and organize these by module then put everything in alphabetical order
[13:23:00] <uGoMobi> things like ... loader CSS should be moved from core CSS in its own file
[13:23:02] <uGoMobi> etc
[13:23:10] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:23:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I made some notes because there is mor
[13:23:17] <uGoMobi> more*
[13:23:23] <uGoMobi> also move CSS in folders
[13:23:26] <arschmitz> i think first step is to make the file order match
[13:23:27] <uGoMobi> and remove prefix
[13:23:31] <uGoMobi> like with JS
[13:23:52] <arschmitz> then we can address issues of name organization and splitting things up
[13:23:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I thought this might be something that has to wait until we are done with all branches
[13:23:57] <arschmitz> and any issues it causes
[13:24:10] <uGoMobi> right before 1.4 alpha release
[13:24:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe might be good to do it sooner rather then later
[13:24:48] <uGoMobi> okay
[13:24:49] <arschmitz> we may discover some issues
[13:24:54] <uGoMobi> right
[13:24:58] <arschmitz> that will need to be fixed
[13:25:06] <arschmitz> also could effect your work on next
[13:25:13] <arschmitz> because its going to reorder the files
[13:25:31] <uGoMobi> note that I changed CSS file order in "next" but that was only for testing issues with the diff file order in the builder
[13:25:33] <arschmitz> not sure if anything you did depends on file order
[13:25:43] <uGoMobi> so this can be ignored when there is a merge conflict
[13:25:49] <arschmitz> ok
[13:26:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I tried to make it not depend on file order
[13:26:23] <uGoMobi> but I am not sure about core CSS
[13:26:29] <arschmitz> cool so fingers crossed the css wont break anything on next lol
[13:26:44] <uGoMobi> lucky it's start with a "c"
[13:26:59] <uGoMobi> only have to check things that start with a or b :)
[13:27:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm for jquery.mobile.js things are a little different
[13:27:49] <arschmitz> that uses requirejs
[13:28:06] <arschmitz> so file order is never guranteed unless its a dependencie
[13:28:14] <uGoMobi> hmm
[13:29:10] <arschmitz> yeah its done async
[13:29:57] <arschmitz> i ran into that fixing some tests a dependency was missing and so because of the async load it would pass like 75% of the time but the other 25% it would fail because the files would load in wrong order
[13:31:24] <arschmitz> hmm actually let me look at that one some more
[13:33:04] <uGoMobi> ok, we can discuss during tomorrow's meeting
[13:33:38] <arschmitz> will you be around?
[13:34:33] <uGoMobi> yeah I will be here for the meeting
[13:34:44] <arschmitz> cool wasent sure knew you had that workshop
[13:34:54] <uGoMobi> that's in the morning here
[13:35:05] <arschmitz> cool
[15:09:53] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'm back
[15:09:58] <gseguin> 'sup?
[16:39:19] <maxlynch> Is there a source file for the icon images?
[16:39:52] <maxlynch> Perhaps an AI file or sag. Just thinking of making some larger sizes of the default icons
[16:39:55] <maxlynch> svg*
