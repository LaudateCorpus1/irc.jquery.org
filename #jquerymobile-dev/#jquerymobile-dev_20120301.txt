[08:28:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/form-width-refactor] First pass at refactoring form widgets to make batter use of available space. - Mat Marquis
[09:15:53] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:16:24] <gseguin> hey rwaldron, still there?
[09:16:34] <rwaldron> I am
[09:16:45] <gseguin> I'm looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3686
[09:16:46] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3686 on jquery-mobile, reported by JFK99 (18h, 23m ago): $("a").live("click") returns different values on desktop browsers and on iOS safari since jQuery Mobile 1.1.0 RC1
[09:16:58] <gseguin> and this seems to be due to the jQuery version
[09:17:01] <rwaldron> oh, hey Wilto... after the qunit meeting, I'm gonna grab food and head over
[09:17:06] <rwaldron> gseguin looking
[09:17:17] <gseguin> it works with 1.6.4 but not with 1.7.1
[09:17:50] <gseguin> any idea what's going on?
[09:18:35] <Wilto> rwaldron: Sounds good, man.
[09:18:48] <rwaldron> gseguin that's bogus
[09:18:50] <rwaldron> invalid
[09:18:55] <rwaldron> tell them to RTFM
[09:18:58] <rwaldron> "Chaining methods is not supported. For example, $("a").find(".offsite, .external").live( ... ); is not valid and does not work as expected."
[09:19:01] <rwaldron> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[09:19:27] <gseguin> doh!
[09:19:32] <rwaldron> if it worked before, it was a coincidence
[09:19:35] <rwaldron> nothing more
[09:19:38] <rwaldron> :)
[09:19:47] <rwaldron> I just saved you a headache
[09:19:55] <rwaldron> that would be a nightmare to debug
[09:20:05] <rwaldron> especially if you think it's supposed to work
[09:20:10] <gseguin> thanks!
[09:20:43] <gseguin> so in the comment box I just put "RTFM" and close the issue, right?
[09:20:46] <gseguin> :P
[09:21:09] <rwaldron> ahahaha
[09:21:11] <rwaldron> NO
[09:21:12] <rwaldron> that's mean
[09:21:14] <rwaldron> :D
[09:21:31] <rwaldron> maybe just link them to the docs?
[09:21:31] <rwaldron> http://api.jquery.com/live/
[09:21:43] <gseguin> yeah yeah, I was kidding
[09:21:58] <gseguin> I'll do that
[09:22:13] <gseguin> thanks very much
[09:22:32] <rwaldron> you're welcome :)
[09:37:46] <gseguin> rwaldron: do you have an iOS simulator handy?
[09:40:50] <gseguin> rwaldron: still there?
[09:41:20] <rwaldron> gseguin i do and i am
[09:41:34] <gseguin> still on that issue
[09:42:02] <gseguin> even if you don't use chaining there is a behavior change between 1.6.4 and 1.7.1
[09:42:53] <gseguin> point your iOS browser to http://jsbin.com/opayeq/2 -> 1.6.4
[09:43:01] <gseguin> and click any link
[09:43:17] <gseguin> now do the same with http://jsbin.com/opayeq/3 -> 1.7.1
[09:43:57] <kinblas> johnbender: gseguin: ping
[09:44:06] <gseguin> kinblas: pong
[09:44:22] <gseguin> 'sup?
[09:44:23] <kinblas> I've been seeing lots of bugs fly by about event handling not working like it used to
[09:44:35] <kinblas> is this a 1.7.1 thang?
[09:44:51] <gseguin> right I'm investingating one with rwaldron right now
[09:45:01] <kinblas> gseguin: which one?
[09:45:12] <gseguin> actually I don't know if that event handling
[09:45:23] <gseguin> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3686
[09:45:24] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3686 on jquery-mobile, reported by JFK99 (18h, 52m ago): $("a").live("click") returns different values on desktop browsers and on iOS safari since jQuery Mobile 1.1.0 RC1
[09:45:26] <kinblas> I saw a couple where accessing values of elements was giving back undefined or wrong results
[09:45:27] <rwaldron> gseguin looking
[09:45:34] <kinblas> oh yeah that one :-)
[09:46:03] <gseguin> kinblas: the one with the radio buttons got fixed by johnbender yesterday
[09:46:12] <kinblas> gseguin: oh ok
[09:46:31] <kinblas> I was just getting concerned because I'm seeing a batch of new bugs regarding "on"
[09:46:42] <kinblas> and these value/href related bugs
[09:47:30] <gseguin> weird thing for that bug is that it's happening only on iOS
[09:47:47] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah I know
[09:47:54] <kinblas> weird
[09:48:18] <kinblas> and if I remember correctly the guy was extracting ele.href
[09:48:23] <kinblas> for his alert
[09:48:33] <kinblas> gseguin: I wonder if it's a push-state bug
[09:48:41] <kinblas> might want to disable that and try it
[09:48:54] <gseguin> hmm ok, will try that
[09:49:16] <gseguin> thanks kinblas
[09:49:17] <kinblas> hmmm, that was probably a dumb suggestion give the fact that it is link related
[09:49:23] <kinblas> :-)
[09:49:34] <kinblas> anyways I see that bug in iOS 4.3.2 in the emulator
[09:50:48] <rwaldron> gseguin bad news
[09:50:57] <rwaldron> when i remove jquery mobile, it works fine
[09:50:58] <rwaldron> http://jsbin.com/opayeq/9
[09:51:08] <gseguin> crap
[09:51:52] <gseguin> thanks for looking into it
[09:51:54] <rick-> so, if you change the edit numbers you can see the path I follow
[09:52:03] <rick-> i keep getting disconntected
[09:52:05] <rick-> ugh
[09:52:10] <gseguin> yeah I see that
[09:52:18] <rwaldron> i tried on(foo)
[09:52:24] <rwaldron> and it was also busted
[09:52:39] <rwaldron> which made me realize it was a property/attr issue
[09:52:54] <rwaldron> so i changed to prop() and it gave what i expected
[09:53:14] <rwaldron> so it occurred to me that jquery mobile might be targetting attr calls somehow?
[09:55:17] <Wilto> We had to patch up a bunch of those shenanigans on checkboxes.
[09:55:31] <gseguin> rwaldron: looking
[09:55:38] <Wilto> s/We/Bender
[10:04:54] <kinblas> gseguin: so printing the actual href attribute (versus the property)
[10:05:01] <kinblas> it has actually been changed to '#'
[10:05:29] <gseguin> but whyyyyyyyyyyy !?
[10:09:29] <kinblas> gseguin: I just confirmed. Switching back to 1.6.4 core ... the problem doesn't happen
[10:09:30] <kinblas> so
[10:09:38] <kinblas> it's core that is doing something funny
[10:10:01] <Wilto> DAMMIT, JQUERY
[10:10:13] <gseguin> that's what I told rwaldron but then he came back with: http://jsbin.com/opayeq/9
[10:10:25] <Wilto> Bender and I were talking about this yesterday.
[10:10:29] <gseguin> where removing jquery.mobile makes it work
[10:10:38] <rwaldron> well, 1.7 was the whole rewrite of events
[10:11:00] <rwaldron> but it works fine without jquery mobile
[10:11:00] <rwaldron> so....
[10:11:12] <Wilto> I think the issue is that core no longer goes back to the DOM to see if something is checked or whatever—it just references the object. By updating the underlying element outside of jQueryspace, the object doesn’t get updated, and checking it in jQueryspace isn’t accurate anymore.
[10:11:28] <Wilto> rwaldron, do I know what the hell I’m talking about here? I’m genuinely not sure.
[10:13:10] <Wilto> I can see the benefit, efficiency-wise. But when you’re mixing-and-matching methods, it throws things off.
[10:13:14] <rwaldron> when did you guys do this...
[10:13:15] <rwaldron> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L352-373
[10:13:39] <Wilto> Right. Sets the attribute on the element just fine.
[10:13:55] <Wilto> Does not update it in this weird jQuery layer that I am very possibly imagining.
[10:14:31] <kinblas> rwaldron: almost a year ago?
[10:14:34] <Wilto> That’s some Back In The Day code.
[10:14:54] <rwaldron> yeah, looking at the blame
[10:15:05] <kinblas> rwaldron: I'll save you time
[10:15:12] <kinblas> code started with scott J
[10:15:20] <kinblas> and I've probably been tagged with blame
[10:15:25] <kinblas> since I shuffled stuff around
[10:15:34] <kinblas> and I wrote the path utillities
[10:15:45] <gseguin> stand up, be back in 15
[10:15:46] <kinblas> the relative/absolute stuff
[10:17:27] <rwaldron> oh, kinblas no worries, I was just curious
[10:17:28] <kinblas> rwaldron: but that code you cite does not touch the href attribute on links
[10:17:39] <rwaldron> looking at any places where attr and href intersect
[10:17:45] <kinblas> it does however affect how the browser resolves them when you check the href property
[10:17:46] <rwaldron> right
[10:18:00] <kinblas> .. resolves relative paths
[10:18:13] <rwaldron> Wilto I'm heading over
[10:18:14] <DaveMethvin> so are we discussing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3686 ?
[10:18:15] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3686 on jquery-mobile, reported by JFK99 (19h, 24m ago): $("a").live("click") returns different values on desktop browsers and on iOS safari since jQuery Mobile 1.1.0 RC1
[10:18:17] <rwaldron> gonna grab food
[10:18:27] <Wilto> Now you guys have done it. rwaldron is comin’ to fight me.
[10:18:34] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: yeah
[10:18:35] <rwaldron> with hugs
[10:18:46] <Wilto> ♥
[10:18:51] <DaveMethvin> let rwaldron eat
[10:18:59] <DaveMethvin> he's huuuuungry!
[10:19:03] <rwaldron> Wilto do you have a spare MBP power adapter?
[10:19:07] <rwaldron> should I bring one?
[10:19:19] <Wilto> We have a couple kicking around, yeah.
[10:19:22] <rwaldron> nce
[10:19:26] <rwaldron> be there in about 20
[10:20:18] <DaveMethvin> so Wilto kinblas i couldn't repro, but this.href is different than $(this).attr("href") is that the basic issue?
[10:20:33] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: no
[10:20:40] <kinblas> the actual attr gets changed somewhere
[10:20:52] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: I switch back to 1.6.4 and it doesn't happen
[10:21:00] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[10:21:13] <kinblas> rwaldron: says, removing jqm from the equation gets things working for him
[10:21:15] <kinblas> which is strange
[10:21:21] <kinblas> so there's some interaction goin' on
[10:21:27] <DaveMethvin> and only in safari?
[10:21:33] <kinblas> only on iOS
[10:21:37] <kinblas> desktop is fine
[10:21:40] <DaveMethvin> oh well that splains it
[10:21:49] <DaveMethvin> i thought safari, and it works fine on windows safari
[10:22:01] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: yeah, use an emulator
[10:22:03] <kinblas> or device
[10:22:09] <kinblas> and you'll see the problem
[10:22:15] <DaveMethvin> lemme grab my ipad
[10:24:09] <DaveMethvin> oh yeah
[10:25:30] <gseguin> back
[10:27:15] <kinblas> gseguin: DaveMethvin: ok so I wrapped $.fn.attr and something is definitely calling attr and setting it to #

[10:40:07] <gseguin> kinblas: I notice the same thing but only once I click the link
[10:41:29] <gseguin> on document ready I print out .attr( "href" ) for all the links on the page
[10:41:37] <gseguin> and the href is right
[10:46:38] <gseguin> kinblas: I think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1240 is the guilty line
[10:48:13] <gseguin> Wilto, johnbender, kinblas, JasonDScott: meeting today?

Could the theme file get something like http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.1.0-rc.1/jquery.mobile.theme-1.1.0-rc.1.css?

[15:02:08] <Wilto> I uh… I don’t seem to have those.
[15:03:15] <johnbender> Wilto: if you just leave it will work for you but the there will be a lot of constant warnings from the linting
[15:03:25] <Wilto> Hm.
[15:04:08] <Wilto> I’mma delete the references to them and see what happens.
[15:05:06] <Wilto> oh god there’s fire everywhere how did this happen
[15:06:00] <Wilto> I discovered iTerm2 today. And “dotfiles.” And terminal theming. Big neckbeard day, for me.
[15:07:13] <erichynds> welcome to the endless world of tweaking, Wilto
[15:07:21] <erichynds> from this day forward you will waste many hours
[15:08:01] <johnbender> Wilto: the best part about dotfiles is moving between machines becomes much less painful

[15:08:18] <Wilto> In fairness, now that my terminal is sufficiently pretty, I choose never to think about it again.
[15:08:25] <johnbender> so if my machine dies I'll have something up and running in a couple of minutes provided it has linux installed

[15:17:24] <gseguin> all this doesn't solve 3686 :(
[15:34:10] <gseguin> rwaldron: I'm still looking into that issue
[15:34:32] <gseguin> any idea why: $( document ).bind( "click", function( event ) {});
[15:34:35] <gseguin> doesn
[15:34:39] <gseguin> 't trigger
[15:34:50] * gseguin needs to move that enter key
[15:35:16] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[15:35:16] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #577: FIXED in 3 min 31 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/577/
[15:35:17] <jq-jenkins> mat: Fixes #3697 ��� `.ui-corner-top`/`.ui-corner-bottom` are no longer incorrectly applied to the first and last elements in a controlgroup within a dialog page.
[15:37:09] <gseguin> kinblas: that's why it's not working ^
[15:37:21] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/wfSwFw
[15:37:21] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] raise a more descriptive exception when no label is present for checkbox or radio controls Fixes #3689 - John Bender
[15:37:27] <gseguin> the "click" handler which restores the href does not trigger
[15:37:43] <gseguin> now as to why that is, I'm clueless
[15:41:00] <kinblas> gseguin: eh? I missed the "why"?
[15:41:31] <gseguin> the jQM "click" handler which restores the href does not trigger
[15:41:51] * gseguin retrieves the line
[15:42:31] <gseguin> that guy: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1246
[15:42:35] <kinblas> so scott added that code that changes the href ... seems pretty ugly ... we shouldn't be mucking with hrefs like that IMO
[15:43:10] <gseguin> I kind of agree but it was working before
[15:43:26] <kinblas> gseguin: our click handler isn't firing? Oh in that example? It's because the guy is calling stopPropagationImmediately
[15:43:57] <kinblas> if his handler is called prior to our click handler that will prevent ours from being called
[15:44:18] <gseguin> no no it triggers when using 1.6.4
[15:44:26] <gseguin> not when using 1.7.1
[15:44:47] <kinblas> in 1.6.4, is our handler getting called first?
[15:45:00] <gseguin> yes
[15:46:07] <gseguin> it looks like in 1.6.4 the document "bound" handlers are executed before the delegate handlers
[15:46:16] <gseguin> and the other way around in 1.7.1
[15:46:27] <kinblas> :-)
[15:46:47] <kinblas> uh that would be bad if the ordering changed
[15:46:59] <gseguin> it does change for sure
[15:47:30] <gseguin> removing the stopImmediatePropagation let the click handler execute
[15:48:24] <kinblas> gseguin: aha, ok so the handlers are re-ordered, the example stopsImmediatePropagation() so we don't get a chance to reset the hrefs (which we shouldn't be doing anyways) so his alerts gets #
[15:48:27] <kinblas> *BUT*
[15:48:39] <kinblas> this re-ordering is only happening on iOS
[15:48:49] <kinblas> ??
[15:48:53] <gseguin> indeed
[15:49:11] <gseguin> weird, heh?
[15:49:12] <kinblas> so this is a core thang then?
[15:49:33] <gseguin> me thinks
[15:49:58] <gseguin> DAMMIT JQUERY!
[15:52:59] <DaveMethvin> so kinblas, i'm not sure how this problem could only be iOS
[15:53:16] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: Yeah I know
[15:53:33] <DaveMethvin> i understand how the delegated runs before the bound, that's , as they say, by design
[15:53:34] <gseguin> yeah, can't explain it either
[15:53:42] <DaveMethvin> so that delegated events can stop propagation
[15:54:06] <DaveMethvin> previously the delegated events all ran at the point where the first delegated event was attached for that element
[15:54:14] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: So is core using capture phase now?
[15:54:15] <gseguin> but that's not the case on the desktop
[15:54:24] <DaveMethvin> no we don't use capture
[15:54:45] <gseguin> and that's why it works on the desktop
[15:54:50] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: So how is it that delegate gets executed before bound?
[15:54:58] <DaveMethvin> the code does it that way
[15:55:05] <DaveMethvin> it has a list and the delegated happen first
[15:55:36] <gseguin> is that new in 1.7.1
[15:55:36] <DaveMethvin> that way if you stopPropagation it won't run the bound events for that element
[15:55:38] <gseguin> ?
[15:55:42] <DaveMethvin> no its' new in 1.7
[15:55:48] <gseguin> oh ok
[15:55:51] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: but doesn't the event bubble up to the delegate
[15:55:55] <gseguin> bingo!
[15:55:56] <DaveMethvin> yes
[15:56:16] <DaveMethvin> it bubbles to the delegate element but we process delegated events first
[15:56:17] <gseguin> that's why it works with 1.6.4 and not with 1.7.1
[15:56:17] <kinblas> so if I did something like $("ul").delegate("li", function(){})
[15:57:29] <kinblas> ... sorry got distracted
[15:57:31] <DaveMethvin> so if you do $("ul").click(fn) and $("ul").delegate("li", "click", fn) the delegate call  has the opportunity to stop prop
[15:57:44] <DaveMethvin> so that the ul wouldn't get the click
[15:57:50] <DaveMethvin> even though it attached first
[15:57:59] <DaveMethvin> since the delegate is "virtually" stopping the click below
[15:58:15] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: oh ok
[15:58:28] <DaveMethvin> dunno if that is related tbh
[15:58:46] <kinblas> I was thinking you were saying that $("li").click(func) would fire after $("ul").delegate("li", "click" ..)
[15:59:01] <DaveMethvin> no, since the li click already happened
[15:59:07] <DaveMethvin> by the time the ul gets it
[15:59:32] <DaveMethvin> but what's really strange is that it only happens on iOS
[15:59:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/Mw05zw
[15:59:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] revert to wrapAll for checkbox and radio Fixes #3688 - John Bender
[15:59:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] test for enhancement with nested input - John Bender
[16:00:01] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: both checkbox issues are addressed for now
[16:00:07] <johnbender> though we're still raising an exception with no label
[16:00:10] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: actually thinking about it, it is working correctly then in 1.7.1
[16:00:41] <gseguin> kinblas: that's right
[16:00:49] <DaveMethvin> i did some tracing on it earlier this afternoon and could see it changing the attr to #
[16:00:56] <kinblas> actually I take it back
[16:00:57] <gseguin> it's the browser that doesn't behave as designed
[16:00:58] <kinblas> it's using live()
[16:01:09] <gseguin> kinblas: same with delegate
[16:01:28] <DaveMethvin> altho iOS is a bit strange about bubbling things beyond the body, right?
[16:01:37] <kinblas> gseguin: actually that would be a good test
[16:01:37] <gseguin> my code does:  $( document ).delegate( ".ui-page-active a.link", "click", function(event) { ...
[16:01:49] <kinblas> do a bunch of addEventListeners on document
[16:01:52] <DaveMethvin> which is basically a live
[16:01:54] <kinblas> and see the ordering
[16:02:01] <kinblas> executed on desktop and ios
[16:02:02] <DaveMethvin> good point kinblas
[16:02:11] <kinblas> they should fire in the order you added them
[16:02:13] <DaveMethvin> is the event in question the vclick?
[16:02:34] <gseguin> so vclick triggers
[16:02:44] <gseguin> and that's the one that sets the href to #
[16:02:53] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: vclick on ios happens on touchend
[16:02:57] <kinblas> well before click
[16:03:13] <DaveMethvin> and then you kill the real click somehow?
[16:03:29] <DaveMethvin> or does vclick always correspond to touchend?
[16:03:36] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: no we don't kill the click unless you preventDefault() on the vclick event
[16:03:37] <gseguin> but then the bound click handler which is supposed to restore the href does not trigger before the delegated/live handler
[16:03:51] <gseguin> brb
[16:04:08] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: so the real issue here is event handler execution ordering
[16:07:52] <DaveMethvin> kinblas: so the href is being changed on vclick but then restored on click?
[16:08:19] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: apparently
[16:08:34] <DaveMethvin> ok, then i think i understand why it's behaving the way it does
[16:08:49] <kinblas> We should talk to scott ... I don't think we should be monkeying around like that
[16:09:06] <kinblas> but understanding why this (event ordering)  is happening is probably a good thing
[16:09:27] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: I just did a quick test with addEventListener on document
[16:09:38] <kinblas> and it fires things in the order I expected (A,B,C)
[16:09:45] <gseguin> kinblas: you beat me to it
[16:10:14] <DaveMethvin> does this href-changing hack only happen on iOS?
[16:10:21] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: so the mystery thickens at least for me
[16:10:50] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: oh hmmm good point ... it's supposed to be a hack to stop the location bar from ddropping
[16:10:52] * kinblas checks
[16:11:07] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: no
[16:11:19] <gseguin> it happens also on desktop
[16:11:47] <DaveMethvin> but gseguin there arent' any touch events on desktop so vclick is click?
[16:12:06] <gseguin> click or mousedown, kinblas ?
[16:12:22] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: yes vclick is click
[16:12:41] <DaveMethvin> the $(document).bind("click" ...) happens after any delegated click events on document, like the .live("click" ...) in the examples, so that would explain why the href is still mangled
[16:12:42] <gseguin> makes sense
[16:13:02] <DaveMethvin> it isn't put back until the live event finishes
[16:13:26] <DaveMethvin> but i dunno why it wouldn't happen on android for example
[16:13:39] * gseguin tests on android
[16:15:00] <DaveMethvin> seems broken on my android too :
[16:15:03] <DaveMethvin> :)
[16:15:05] <gseguin> same on android indeed
[16:15:19] <DaveMethvin> yay for consistently hosed
[16:15:40] <gseguin> alright so we need to change these bind into delegate
[16:15:55] <kinblas> gseguin how do you delegate to document?
[16:16:41] <DaveMethvin> i guess you want to catch anything from any element?
[16:16:48] <gseguin> yeah
[16:16:50] <DaveMethvin> you could use "*" as a selector
[16:16:56] * DaveMethvin shudders
[16:17:00] <DaveMethvin> not very efficient
[16:17:00] <gseguin> delegate( "*", "click"
[16:17:24] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: well really from links ... but I think we switched from live() because of the perf aspects ... clicking was already slow
[16:17:44] <DaveMethvin> yeah, doing the delegation yourself is not a bad idea if perf is a problem
[16:18:08] <DaveMethvin> but in this case the builtin delegation is trying to provide better semantics like stopping propagation
[16:18:21] <DaveMethvin> and you need some way to run before that
[16:18:41] <DaveMethvin> i actually have another bug i was tackling that required something similar
[16:19:20] <DaveMethvin> i don't think delegatign to * will be a good idea
[16:19:32] <kinblas> gseguin: DaveMethvin: I guess to me the better solution here is to not do the hack
[16:19:41] <DaveMethvin> yeah, i would  agree there
[16:19:53] <gseguin> +1 to no hack
[16:19:56] <kinblas> but the ordering thing is a big change
[16:19:59] <kinblas> :-)
[16:20:04] <DaveMethvin> i think any event attached below is going to see the incorrect thing anyway
[16:20:05] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: thanks for schooling us
[16:20:17] <gseguin> yep thanks!
[16:20:40] <DaveMethvin> it always seems that any good feature creates an equal and opposite bug
[16:20:43] <kinblas> brb ... someone needs my help
[16:21:05] <gseguin> though kinblas besides that href monkeying it could break other things
[16:46:52] <gseguin> kinblas: changing these bind by: $( document ).delegate( "a, a *" seems to do the trick

[17:32:39] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3702 on jquery-mobile, reported by pavliy (11h, 31m ago): JQM 1.1.0RC1 + Phonegap - tap delay
[17:32:52] <Wilto> Does the log clear itself once the build is un-busted?
[17:32:55] <Wilto> Oh no.
[17:33:15] <gseguin> which log ?
[17:33:57] <Wilto> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/576/console
[17:34:25] <gseguin> oh that's an old build
[17:34:26] <Wilto> Weird.
[17:34:39] <gseguin> we're at build 584
[17:34:59] <gseguin> no, though it should stay
[17:35:35] <Wilto> Anyway, whassup.

[17:35:51] <gseguin> although looking back... it doesnt seem to stick
[17:35:51] <Wilto> That 200ms delay is lagging things out that bad in PhoneGap, is the main idea there?
[17:36:30] <gseguin> I looked at the code and saw that you probably would know better
[17:36:36] <Wilto> That’s a weird one.
[17:37:30] <gseguin> yeah he's saying that if you set hoverDelay to 0 it works
[17:37:56] <Wilto> Thaaat makes no sense.
[17:38:30] <Wilto> Alright, I’ll dig into that tomorrow.
[17:38:43] <Wilto> I dunno how much I can do, though. I gotta get PhoneGap up and running someplace.
[17:38:44] <gseguin> cool
[17:39:19] <gseguin> alright gotta dash, later everyone
