[08:49:46] <gseguin> good morning
[08:50:39] <Wilto> Hey man.
[08:50:39] <bot-t1> (10 hours 1 min ago) <matjas> tell Wilto the-fuck.gif http://i.imgur.com/pxSQm.gif
[08:50:52] <Wilto> …oh, matjas.

[08:58:35] <johnbender> gseguin: well after much wrestling I've got the nav tests running stubbed
[08:58:41] <johnbender> gseguin: or at least it appears that way
[08:58:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 3 new commits to amd: http://git.io/Lk1Jmg

[08:58:52] <gseguin> kewl !
[08:59:11] <Wilto> My tests are now un-broke, which is exciting for me.
[08:59:16] <johnbender> Wilto: Nice!
[08:59:24] <johnbender> Wilto: I was just going to say we'll need to wait to merge it in
[08:59:31] <johnbender> but that means we can do it now
[08:59:35] <Wilto> Hopefully.
[08:59:46] <johnbender> Wilto: well done man, that was fast
[08:59:53] <Wilto> I haven’t seen a jubilant “build fixed” up in here yet.
[09:00:00] <Wilto> But everything checks out locally.
[09:04:33] <johnbender> Wilto: cool if we get close I'll probably just merge and sort out the carnage
[09:05:35] <Wilto> What Could Go Wrong?™
[09:05:42] <johnbender> :D
[09:05:53] <johnbender> as long as we're green before we ship it's fine
[09:11:59] <toddmparker_> any errors popping up or are we good?
[09:17:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: going through the test suite on the amd branch now to sort out issues
[09:17:20] <johnbender> I sadly spent most of yesterday sorting out the nav tests
[09:17:29] <johnbender> hopefully we'll merge this in to master today
[09:17:43] <gseguin> thanks johnbender for doing that
[09:17:55] <gseguin> I'm still working on the no.de service
[09:18:02] <johnbender> gseguin: np, I'm happy to take this the last little bit since you did all the hard stuff
[09:18:12] <gseguin> the post_receive hook needed some work
[09:18:28] <johnbender> gseguin: one thing we still need to do is add a little blurb in the README about setting up for dev with require
[09:18:35] <johnbender> gseguin: including the submodule commad
[09:18:57] <gseguin> true
[09:19:20] <johnbender> gseguin: and then something quick in the docs about using it with the mobile rendering class and a disclaimer that we're not reommending it be used that way
[09:19:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: then, when we do the 1.0.1 release I'd really like to ask people to help us sort out the dependencies
[09:19:55] <gseguin> johnbender: for the fouc when running with requirejs ?
[09:20:02] <johnbender> since we've only done a very little to determine what they are
[09:20:04] <toddmparker_> the amd stuff wouldn't be in 1.0.1, right?
[09:20:07] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[09:20:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: no
[09:20:13] <toddmparker_> ok, good
[09:20:14] <johnbender> but we need people to participate
[09:20:19] <toddmparker_> yeah
[09:20:29] <toddmparker_> i'm sure we'll get some interested parties
[09:20:29] <johnbender> just need to make that distinction :D
[09:20:42] <johnbender> yah, I imagine there will be a ton of people interested in running it that way
[09:20:49] <toddmparker_> for sure
[09:20:53] <gseguin> and we probably need to do some refactoring 'cause some deps aren't making sense
[09:20:55] <johnbender> we just need to tell them it's not supported as yet
[09:20:59] <johnbender> gseguin: yes
[09:21:13] <johnbender> so educational setting this up
[09:21:37] <johnbender> gseguin: is there anyway to get a nested hash of the deps so we can generate a dot graph or something?
[09:21:45] <johnbender> would be nice to visualize our sillyness :D
[09:22:03] <toddmparker_> that would be cool
[09:22:35] <gseguin> the /dependencies endpoint in amd-builder.no.de is not enough?
[09:22:48] <johnbender> gseguin: I have no idea! I haven't looked yet
[09:22:55] <johnbender> that might be my answer :D
[09:23:13] <gseguin> basically gives you the dep maps for all components you ask for
[09:23:28] <gseguin> it's not nested though

[09:23:56] <Wilto> Dammit.
[09:24:15] <johnbender> Wilto: you fixed the nav failure
[09:24:27] <johnbender> now we just need to address the select tests
[09:24:32] <Wilto> Those passed for me.
[09:24:37] <toddmparker_> just saw that
[09:24:38] <Wilto> I’ll get it sorted.
[09:24:39] <toddmparker_> odd
[09:25:05] <johnbender> Wilto: try it a couple times
[09:25:18] <johnbender> the state of the page often dictates failures since we have nothing to manage said state :(
[09:25:21] <johnbender> so bad

[09:38:45] <Wilto> Okay, found the issue. I think we’re square.
[09:39:03] <johnbender> Wilto: nice
[09:39:14] <Wilto> Fingers crossed.

[10:23:30] <johnbender> Wilto: ^ winner
[10:23:41] * johnbender is impressed
[10:23:45] <johnbender> that didn't take long at all
[10:23:50] <Wilto> Yippie indeed.
[10:24:00] <kinblas> toddmparker_: WIlto: did you guys get a chance to try out that orientation test page on the playbook?
[10:24:01] <Wilto> Ah, it was just a matter of fixing a couple of classes.
[10:24:03] <johnbender> Wilto: it looks like it was mostly updating the tests though eh?
[10:24:07] <Wilto> Yep.
[10:24:09] <johnbender> cool
[10:24:13] <johnbender> that won't always be the case
[10:24:17] <Wilto> kinblas: Not yet.
[10:24:51] <kinblas> slackers :-P
[10:25:08] <johnbender> kinblas: have we heard back about RIM devices?
[10:25:12] <johnbender> I assume not
[10:25:34] <kinblas> johnbender: nope, last was that it was being worked on
[10:25:47] <kinblas> that was in Oct
[10:25:53] * johnbender sighs
[10:26:05] <johnbender> it's too bad it's such an uphill battle for them
[10:27:24] <toddmparker_> kinblas: nope, but i can
[10:27:33] <toddmparker_> did you email the url?
[10:28:37] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah emailed yesterday around 5pm-ish PST

[10:55:33] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] Added "nofade" transition, slide/up/down for non-3D devices - toddparker
[10:59:54] <Wilto> Hey gseguin, sanity-check me: should http://amd-builder.no.de/jquery-mobile/amd/dependencies?baseUrl=js&names=slider be returning, uh, something?
[11:00:08] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Do you guys consider it at all important to have widget react to .widgetname("option", "widget-option", newValue)?
[11:00:12] <gseguin> jquery.mobile.slider
[11:00:17] <gseguin> should
[11:00:18] <Wilto> Ah-hah.
[11:00:23] <gseguin> sorry
[11:00:29] <gseguin> jquery.mobile.forms.slider
[11:00:42] <_|Nix|_> I wrote a widget option tester (http://web-ui-fw.github.com/option-test.html) and find that the widgets do not react to such calls.
[11:00:44] <Wilto> …Nada.
[11:00:57] <Wilto> http://amd-builder.no.de/jquery-mobile/amd/dependencies?baseUrl=js&names=jquery.mobile.forms.slider
[11:01:00] <_|Nix|_> It's like the options are only for construction, and they're subsequently ignored.
[11:01:35] <gseguin> then there is a problem with my last push
[11:01:38] <gseguin> oops
[11:01:40] <gseguin> sorry
[11:01:49] <gseguin> I'll get on it in a minute
[11:02:01] <gseguin> were you looking for sample data?

[11:02:23] <Wilto> gseguin: Ah, yeah. No rush, though—just getting my bearings.
[11:02:38] <Wilto> Definitely not at the point where I’m building dependency stuff in.
[11:03:12] <_|Nix|_> Just wondering, because I'd be willing to allocate some energy towards properly doing _setOption for a lot of the widgets' options ...
[11:03:52] <gseguin> Wilto: so the format is: { "jquery.mobile.forms.slider": { deps: [ "module1", "module2" ]} }
[11:23:43] <Wilto> Sweet.
[11:23:43] <bot-t1> (14 mins 20 secs ago) <snover> tell wilto what was your android animation fix hack?
[11:24:02] <Wilto> Hah.
[11:27:11] <johnbender> gseguin: looks like I have all the tests on amd passing
[11:27:18] <johnbender> gseguin: probably going to merge shortly
[11:27:22] <gseguin> F yeah!
[11:27:34] <gseguin> great job johnbender !
[11:27:41] <johnbender> gseguin: great job to you sir
[11:28:00] <johnbender> I think I only punted on a couple of the tests
[11:28:10] <johnbender> the one ugly one is the transitions dependency
[11:28:19] <johnbender> I wasn't quite able to sort that out
[11:28:45] <gseguin> ok
[11:29:35] <johnbender> gseguin: I was getting my mind tangled when I was working on the tests let me take a swipe at it real quick
[11:29:46] <johnbender> gseguin: the result is that css transitions don't work on the amd branch :P
[11:29:52] <johnbender> so should be easy to fix
[11:30:53] <gseguin> alright, let me know if I can help
[11:31:37] <johnbender> gseguin: bingo
[11:32:18] <johnbender> gseguin: switching the dep from transtion <- nav to nav <- transition, where <- indicates that the rhs is depedent on the lhs, fixed it
[11:32:40] <johnbender> I'll include a note there
[11:33:04] <johnbender> I have a feeling there are going to be a host of little bugs like that when working when using require js
[11:33:16] <johnbender> luckily we don't have to support that out of the gate
[11:33:23] <johnbender> it's just for the builder :D
[11:33:53] <gseguin> yeah but it's great though it helps us keeping our code clean
[11:36:03] <johnbender> hell yah
[11:36:44] <johnbender> gseguin: although this doesn't guarantee load order does it
[11:36:53] <johnbender> gseguin: it's just a happy coincidence
[11:36:55] <gseguin> no
[11:37:02] <gseguin> order! does
[11:37:03] <johnbender> gseguin: so will the order plugin ensure it
[11:37:05] <johnbender> ok
[11:37:16] <johnbender> that's what I figured
[11:38:04] <gseguin> though I'm pretty sure it guarantees that the dependency will appear first in the bundle when building
[11:38:39] <johnbender> gseguin: yep
[11:38:55] <johnbender> gseguin: it shows up in the proper order in terms of top to bottom includes

[11:47:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did you guys revert to email? I feel like I've seen less basecamp stuff lately
[11:47:43] <toddmparker_> yeah, sloppy
[11:48:03] <johnbender> it's so hard to be diligent like that when one is used to email
[11:48:34] <kinblas> what I hate about basecamp is lack of formatting
[11:48:41] <Wilto> I just print questions out, make them into paper airplanes, and throw them at Todd.
[11:49:41] <gseguin> Can I have you guys' fax number?
[11:49:42] <johnbender> kinblas: ? textile!
[11:49:50] <johnbender> kinblas: I'd prefer markdown but whatever
[11:50:05] <johnbender> maybe a javascript markdown -> textile converter is in order
[11:50:21] <johnbender> kinblas: you use markdown on github eh?
[11:50:30] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah
[11:50:44] <kinblas> johnbender: ugh, so basecamp uses textile?
[11:50:54] <johnbender> I think so yah

[11:50:58] * kinblas sighs
[11:51:21] <kinblas> johnbender: ok good to know

[12:02:34] <toddmparker_> woo hoo
[12:02:38] <Wilto> Godspeed.
[12:02:44] <johnbender> when I push
[12:02:48] <johnbender> there are a couple things to keep in mind
[12:02:49] <Wilto> I might unplug my computer and step away, for fear.
[12:02:50] * gseguin is all excited but nervous at the same time
[12:03:00] <johnbender> ORDERING may cause bugs
[12:03:07] <kinblas> gseguin: I believe that is called "giddy"
[12:03:08] <johnbender> but _only_ in development
[12:03:29] <kinblas> johnbender: ??
[12:03:40] <johnbender> kinblas: we're async loading all the libraries
[12:03:45] <kinblas> johnbender: oh because we rely on AMD to async
[12:03:45] <gseguin> because RequireJS loads module asynchronously
[12:03:49] <johnbender> and it's possible that we missed some ordering issues
[12:03:56] <johnbender> kinblas: right!
[12:04:21] <johnbender> that's REALLY important to keep in mind when testing bugs
[12:04:21] <kinblas> johnbender: hmmm ok
[12:04:35] <johnbender> you can switch back with a one line change
[12:05:08] <johnbender> kinblas: so if you run into something funny and want to double check just load the old way
[12:05:13] <johnbender>  /js
[12:05:20] <johnbender> it's still in there
[12:05:36] <johnbender> kinblas: we've done our best to suss out those issues by setting up the tests to use the async
[12:05:44] <johnbender> and I think we've covered near everything
[12:05:50] <johnbender> but you guys should know
[12:05:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: should I post this to basecamp for scott too?
[12:06:03] <johnbender> just a quick not and how to switch back to check
[12:06:11] <kinblas> johnbender: ok, it just means we need to do 3 things now when introducing new files?
[12:06:19] <johnbender> kinblas: for now yes
[12:06:32] <johnbender> ideally once it's figured out we won't need the index.php in /js
[12:06:37] <kinblas> make sure build/make order is correct, make sure combine.php works, make sure AMD works
[12:06:54] <kinblas> ok ... I'll try to avoid new files :-P
[12:06:55] <johnbender> kinblas: well the build / make is taken care of
[12:06:58] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[12:07:00] <toddmparker_> yes please
[12:07:14] <gseguin> we don't need combine.php anymore
[12:07:23] <toddmparker_> does this mean the docs will work locally since we don't need php?
[12:07:24] <johnbender> its just /jquery.mobile.js and /index.php now
[12:07:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: you still need a server
[12:07:39] <toddmparker_> ok
[12:07:40] <gseguin> when you add a file, for now just make sure you add it to js/jquery.mobile.js
[12:07:41] <johnbender> I've added the python command back into the docs
[12:08:02] <gseguin> yeah index.php should go away I think
[12:08:16] <gseguin> but maybe we can keep it around during the transition
[12:08:19] <johnbender> gseguin: well we still want to make sure the index.php gets updated so people can check until we're confident
[12:08:23] <johnbender> yes
[12:08:34] <johnbender> kinblas: so it's just js/jquery.mobile.js
[12:08:40] <johnbender> and js/index.php
[12:08:55] <johnbender> and eventually .... just js/jquery.mobile.js :D
[12:09:04] <gseguin> the build relies on jquery.mobile.js
[12:09:06] <johnbender> so many birds with this stone
[12:09:57] <johnbender> heading to basecampe to put this all down
[12:10:40] <johnbender> -e
[12:11:35] <kinblas> johnbender: gseguin: congrats!
[12:11:59] <gseguin> thanks!
[12:12:41] <Wilto> Yeah, this is huge.
[12:13:47] <johnbender> kinblas: so, thanks to gseguin, we're in the process of fixing the build maintenance, we've identified a whole cluster of silly dependencies, and we can have minimal build libraries
[12:13:57] <johnbender> total crazytown winning type stuff
[12:21:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: posted to basecamp
[12:21:17] <toddmparker_> sweet
[12:21:22] <toddmparker_> yay
[12:21:33] <toddmparker_> awesome work gseguin and johnbender
[12:21:40] <toddmparker_> huge step forward
[12:23:15] <Wilto> Three whole things to keep in mind, johnbender? UGH this is so much WORK
[12:23:21] <Wilto> REVERT IT ALL
[12:23:31] <johnbender> Wilto: lol, well I hate cognitive overhead when developing
[12:23:56] <johnbender> and this creates a possible nefarious source of bugs in dev docs
[12:24:05] <johnbender> luckily if you just aren't sure there's an easy way to check
[12:24:15] <Wilto> True, true.
[12:24:40] <johnbender> no conflicts ...
[12:24:43] <johnbender> whoa
[12:24:53] <johnbender> merge luck ++
[12:25:05] <Wilto> what
[12:25:36] <johnbender> gseguin: did we want to move order.js to external?
[12:27:10] <johnbender> gseguin: we should also remedy the fouc before pushing this live since it will be in /test on the website eh?
[12:28:08] <johnbender> gseguin: can we just add the equivelant to the jqm-docs.css?
[12:28:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to fade-out-in-transition: http://git.io/SAXfDA
[12:28:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] Slide transition improvements - toddparker
[12:30:43] <johnbender> looks like the test suite it passing too
[12:30:48] <johnbender> crazy town
[12:31:21] <Wilto> We all just cashed our chances at a winning lottery ticket in the future.
[12:31:36] <johnbender> seriously
[12:32:16] <toddmparker_> wow, you guys are officially GODS
[12:32:36] <toddmparker_> funny how a ton of prep work and planning makes it all look so easy
[12:33:18] * johnbender points at gseguin
[12:33:35] <johnbender> all I did was clean up the tests
[12:33:47] <johnbender> dude had all the answers
[12:33:57] <johnbender> gseguin: pragmas are genius btw
[12:35:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so one thing I should consult you on
[12:35:27] <Wilto> GSEGUIN FOR PRESIDENT OF #JQUERYMOBILE-DEV
[12:35:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: there's a fouc when loading the library async but this can be remmedied in the docs by adding the mobile rending class manually
[12:36:07] <johnbender> *remedied
[12:39:36] <johnbender> arg! one failure
[12:40:07] <Wilto> REVERT IT ALL
[12:40:26] <toddmparker_> johnbender: you mean adding that to docs.js?
[12:42:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: hmm I trying to see if I can do it that way without having to add it manually
[12:42:41] <johnbender> so far no dice
[12:42:50] <toddmparker_> fouc that
[12:44:19] <toddmparker_> kinblas: i'm testing that orientation page on plybook now
[12:44:59] <toddmparker_> what do you want me to do? load in landscape, then change to portrat then dump?
[12:46:11] <kinblas> toddmparker_: the test logs the events that get generated, in backwards order (most recent at top)
[12:46:33] <kinblas> it would be interesting to see if the window.orientation (wo) is not being set at all, or if it is getting set after the events are fired.
[12:46:35] <toddmparker_> do you care the order?
[12:46:55] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it would be good to note the order
[12:47:02] <kinblas> so we know if it is different from other platforms
[12:47:10] <kinblas> some fire orientationchange then resize
[12:47:19] <kinblas> but the sizes in the orientationchange event may be different
[12:47:20] <toddmparker_> should i test both ways and give you two dumps?
[12:47:21] <kinblas> from the resize event
[12:47:24] <kinblas> yeah sure
[12:47:28] <toddmparker_> ok
[12:47:39] <toddmparker_> did you run this on your honeycomb tablet?
[12:47:42] <toddmparker_> that is busted too
[12:47:51] <kinblas> toddmparker_: hmmm I should check that, hang on
[12:48:21] <toddmparker_> ok
[12:48:26] <toddmparker_> i was able to repro there
[12:48:32] <toddmparker_> same as PB
[12:49:24] <kinblas> toddmparker_: note that there is a button you can push after the events have fired to see if things are the same after all events are done
[12:51:04] <kinblas> toddmparker_: AHA!
[12:51:19] <Wilto> Science just happened.
[12:51:21] <kinblas> toddmparker_: On the Xoom, the landscape is the default orientation
[12:51:44] <kinblas> we do get different values 0, 90, -90, 180
[12:51:55] <kinblas> but the the 0 and 180 are landscape orientations
[12:52:07] <kinblas> this is the opposite of iPad
[12:52:09] * kinblas sighs
[12:52:26] <toddmparker_> fun
[12:52:28] <Wilto> Wow.
[12:52:34] <toddmparker_> i can't copy/paste in the playbook!
[12:52:38] <kinblas> guess that makes sense since they put their logo and the verizon words so they are readable in landscape
[12:52:55] <kinblas> ... on the bezel that is
[12:54:01] * kinblas sighs
[12:54:10] <kinblas> orientation change also reports the previous dimensions
[12:54:47] <Wilto> “You can have any orientation you want, as long as it’s landscape.”
[12:57:10] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ok so that just shows that we are making a bad assumption
[12:57:29] <kinblas> we are assuming in our getOrientation() code that 0,180 are portrati
[12:57:31] <kinblas> portrait
[12:58:29] <kinblas> also, our getOrientation() function may return bad results depending on when you call it.
[12:58:46] <kinblas> since the dimensions are unreliable until after the resize
[12:59:08] * gseguin is back from lunch, catching up
[13:00:48] <kinblas> we should do a sweep through all our devices and log in a matrix how orientation is handled using that test case
[13:01:04] <kinblas> I started one a long while back (Oct 2010)?
[13:01:17] <kinblas> but I was also doing things like tracking the affect of the meta tag
[13:01:28] <kinblas> which makes things even more ugly
[13:01:32] <Wilto> gseguin: Is there a way to just get one bigass JSON with all the dependencies in it, rather than making granular requests for ’em?
[13:01:41] <toddmparker_> kinblas: i just emailed my PB result
[13:01:45] <toddmparker_> man, that was difficult
[13:01:47] <gseguin> did I miss something?
[13:02:08] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm working on one test before pushing to master
[13:02:14] <johnbender> gseguin: we also need to address the fouc
[13:02:21] <johnbender> since it'll show up in /test on the site
[13:02:36] <gseguin> just put ui-rendering on all doc pages
[13:02:38] <johnbender> gseguin: I took a 2 second swipe at adding to the docs js but that didn't pan out
[13:02:43] <toddmparker_> so kin, can we just compare h and w dimensions to decide what is portrait and landscape?
[13:02:50] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I'd like to avoid doing it manually if possible
[13:03:38] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it seems like we have to ... but we have that problem I mentioned above
[13:04:01] <kinblas> if someone calls getOrientation() during orientationchange callback, or between an orientationchange and resize they may get the wrong results
[13:04:01] <gseguin> Wilto: you can either put all the components in the "names" attr coma separated
[13:04:19] <toddmparker_> hmm
[13:04:21] <gseguin> or I can come up with something
[13:04:32] <toddmparker_> that's tricky kinblas
[13:04:34] <kinblas> toddmparker_: wrong results because some devices don't update the dimensions until the resize
[13:04:45] <toddmparker_> gotcha
[13:05:00] <toddmparker_> is it a timing thing then?
[13:05:02] <gseguin> Wilto: but implementing another way would be jqm specific
[13:05:10] <Wilto> Would it be a huge pain in the ass to set that up, for your part? I mean, no reason I can’t just include everything in one big dependencies call.
[13:05:11] <Wilto> Oh, hm.
[13:05:58] <gseguin> and the service right now is pretty project agnostic
[13:06:00] <toddmparker_> kin, did you see my results email?
[13:06:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: you results look ok, can you repro the problem they see in 2933?
[13:06:04] <toddmparker_> sendign from PB is odd
[13:06:20] <Wilto> Yeah, gotcha.
[13:06:33] <gseguin> Wilto: what's the problem with specifying all the comps in names?
[13:07:12] <Wilto> gseguin: Comps?
[13:07:19] <gseguin> components
[13:07:31] <Wilto> Oh, hurr.
[13:07:31] <toddmparker_> kinblas: that test page gets it backwards
[13:07:53] <Wilto> Yeah, that’s what I’m gonna do. Not a big deal by any stretch, I just didn’t know if there was a built in “give me everything” already.
[13:08:18] <toddmparker_> window.orientation for portrait says -90
[13:08:25] <toddmparker_> says i'm landscape
[13:09:23] <gseguin> Wilto: maybe I can scan the baseUrl and query dependency for all the js I find
[13:09:44] <gseguin> so all you'll have to call would be /dependencies?baseUrl=js
[13:09:49] <Wilto> That seems tricky to me, but you’d certainly know better.
[13:10:01] <kinblas> toddmparker_: that test case is just echoing what the window.orientation value is
[13:10:04] <gseguin> I'll work on it next
[13:10:16] <Wilto> Awesome. Thanks, dude!
[13:10:24] <Wilto> That would still be project-agnostic too, yeah?
[13:10:40] <gseguin> indeed
[13:10:51] <toddmparker_> so it converts - or -90 or whatever to either portrait or landscape
[13:10:54] <Wilto> Sweet.
[13:11:06] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I guess what I'm saying is that your data says you are starting with window.orientation set to 90 ... which matches iPad (landscape)
[13:11:29] <kinblas> toddmparker_: on the Xoom I get 0 or 180 when holding it in landscape
[13:12:28] <toddmparker_> me too on PB
[13:12:38] <toddmparker_> that's why they have the same bug
[13:13:47] <toddmparker_> PB says +/-90 for portrait
[13:15:06] <kinblas> toddmparker_: hmmm so when you generated your data, you started in portrait, flipped to landscape, and then back to portrait?
[13:15:27] <toddmparker_> don't think so :)
[13:15:32] <toddmparker_> lemme re-check
[13:15:55] <toddmparker_> what info shoul i tell you?
[13:15:57] <Wilto> Oh, something I noticed too, gseguin: { "jquery.mobile.forms.slider": { deps : [ "module1", "module2" ]} }
[13:16:08] <Wilto> “Deps” should be in double-quotes.
[13:16:09] <kinblas> toddmparker: your email started with landscape > portrait
[13:16:10] <gseguin> yeah?
[13:16:14] <kinblas> but that's not what the data says :-)
[13:16:17] <gseguin> yeah yeah it will be
[13:16:35] <toddmparker_> maybe i was confused
[13:16:35] <Wilto> FIX IT FIX IT
[13:16:44] <gseguin> typo when I typed in the chat room
[13:16:52] <gseguin> OK OK OK
[13:17:05] <Wilto> DAMMIT, SCOTT
[13:17:09] <toddmparker_> it is def. 90 for portrait and 180 landscape
[13:17:20] <toddmparker_> so ignore my text :)
[13:17:31] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ok so that matches Xoom and is the opposite of iOS
[13:17:50] * kinblas consults the spec (Apple's)
[13:17:51] <toddmparker_> so odd
[13:18:28] <toddmparker_> all i know if that if you open a dialog, the black bg layer is the height of the window in landscape, even if you're holding it portrait
[13:18:41] <toddmparker_> identical on HC and PB
[13:19:47] <kinblas> toddmparker_: that's because our code is assuming 0 and 180 are portrait
[13:19:56] <toddmparker_> that's no good
[13:19:58] <kinblas> so we pull the wrong dimension
[13:20:15] <toddmparker_> so my thought was to just confirm that by comparing height and width
[13:20:41] <toddmparker_> if it thinks it's portrait, but the width is greater than the height flip it
[13:20:47] <kinblas> toddmparker_: right, with the caveat/problem mentioned previously about the window of time it can be wrong
[13:21:10] <toddmparker_> but do we run this once or on every orientation change?
[13:21:44] <kinblas> you can call getOrientation() at any time and it will then query window.orientation if it is supported
[13:21:55] <toddmparker_> i think if we added in a sanity check, we might find that it catches most of the brokenness
[13:22:00] <toddmparker_> timing is a tricky one to solve
[13:22:06] <kinblas> unfortunately implementations differ
[13:22:11] <kinblas> hang on looking for specs
[13:22:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: I made the last alterations to the current setup
[13:23:00] <johnbender> as far as orientation is concerned
[13:23:11] <johnbender> with a big red note that timing is really abd
[13:23:24] <johnbender> meaning you _CAN'T_ use height and width if you bind to the event
[13:23:39] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[13:23:47] <kinblas> eh?
[13:23:52] <johnbender> you'd have to set up a watcher for the height and width
[13:24:16] <johnbender> if you bind to "orientationchange" the height and width won't be changed in some of the browsers
[13:24:21] <johnbender> that was causing us issues before
[13:24:25] <kinblas> toddmparker_: one other thing to scare you
[13:24:39] <toddmparker_> uh oh
[13:24:46] <kinblas> I believe the meta viewport has influence as to whether or not a resize is fired on orientation change
[13:24:59] <Wilto> …That makes sense, in a tragic sort of way.
[13:25:00] <toddmparker_> yeesh
[13:25:20] <kinblas> some settings lock the device width and cause scaling
[13:25:21] <toddmparker_> do is this fixable at all?
[13:25:23] <kinblas> vs resizing
[13:25:32] <toddmparker_> right
[13:25:35] <kinblas> toddmparker_: what we need is a BAEM
[13:25:40] <toddmparker_> ?
[13:25:41] <kinblas> BigAssEventMatrix
[13:25:49] <toddmparker_> you love those
[13:25:53] <kinblas> heh
[13:26:09] <kinblas> we need to understand the behvaior on the various devices OS versions
[13:26:16] <kinblas> to get a sense of how and if it can be worked around
[13:26:26] <kinblas> there has to be a way to tell what the default orientation is
[13:26:27] <toddmparker_> even if we do, how do we normalize?
[13:26:50] <toddmparker_> i'm willing to help test
[13:27:04] <toddmparker_> ideally, we'd build a test page that logs the result
[13:27:26] <toddmparker_> maybe you just press a portrait or landscape button so save it
[13:31:58] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ok so I have an idea
[13:32:03] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[13:32:12] <kinblas> it's along the lines of Scott's little media queries trick
[13:32:17] <Wilto> Is it “just crazy enough to work?”
[13:32:35] <kinblas> Wilto: I'm thinking it might
[13:32:48] <toddmparker_> cool
[13:32:49] <kinblas> so what if we set up a supports test that used media queries and orientation
[13:32:51] <toddmparker_> i like crazy
[13:33:08] <kinblas> to set a specific width on some injected node
[13:33:27] <kinblas> we set the width different for landscape and portrait
[13:33:37] <kinblas> we read it's dimension
[13:33:45] <kinblas> and compare that against window.orientation
[13:33:53] <kinblas> bam ... we know what maps to what
[13:34:01] <kinblas> I meant BAM!
[13:34:31] <Wilto> ?BOOM
[13:34:32] <bot-t1> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[13:34:45] <Wilto> I sure did are, bot-t. I sure did are.
[13:35:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright, I'd like to just add ui-mobile-rendering onto the html tage of the docs
[13:35:39] <kinblas> so something like injecting @media all and (orientation: portrait) { #dummy { width: 5px } }
[13:35:45] <johnbender> s/tage/tag/
[13:36:20] <Wilto> Oh, that’s a good idea.
[13:36:21] <kinblas> then checking the width of dummy ... if it isn't 5px, then it's landscape, and whatever the value of window.orientation is
[13:36:34] <kinblas> means landscape
[13:36:46] <gseguin> johnbender: the script way didn't work out I guess
[13:37:01] <kinblas> Wilto: you talkin' to johnbender? Or me? :-)
[13:37:13] <Wilto> You.
[13:37:21] <Wilto> Everyone. GOOD IDEAS ALL AROUND I’m so tired.
[13:37:36] <kinblas> Wilto: ok, great ... lol ... you want to try it out? Today is non-jqm-day for me :-P
[13:37:56] <Wilto> Kinda married to builder stuff for the time being, but I can grab that tomorrow AM if you want.
[13:38:19] <kinblas> ok, maybe what I'll do is basecamp it so if scott is game tonight he can try?
[13:38:25] <kinblas> if not we can pick up tomorrow or Friday
[13:40:00] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm I have an idea
[13:40:12] <gseguin> you too?
[13:40:19] <johnbender> occasionally
[13:40:22] <Wilto> Eh, I think Scott’s got a couple of things going on already tonight.
[13:40:25] <gseguin> TODAY is IDEA DAY!
[13:40:37] <Wilto> Actually, the more I think about it, that one sounds kinda fun. I’m totally snagging it.
[13:40:39] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm listening
[13:40:52] <Wilto> For some values of “fun,” y’know.
[13:41:53] <johnbender> gseguin: gar
[13:42:04] <johnbender> well I was just going to point the require js include at jquery mobile
[13:42:27] <johnbender> but that would require an asston of work
[13:43:02] <gseguin> hmm not quite sure what you mean
[13:43:22] <johnbender> gseguin: right now all the require js script tag definitions point to the docs js
[13:43:31] <johnbender> which in turn depends on jquery.mobile.js
[13:43:35] <gseguin> oh
[13:43:36] <gseguin> ok
[13:44:00] <johnbender> I have to pull it out of the require js setup to make it a blocking load
[13:44:20] <gseguin> oh gotcha
[13:44:36] <gseguin> I can maybe take care of that afterward if you want
[13:44:37] <johnbender> but because there are nested directories it requires additional crap, I can't just sed it in there
[13:45:08] <johnbender> gseguin: I want to get it done before we push to master because it's going to end up on /test
[13:45:10] <gseguin> that's when you want an IDE
[13:45:28] <gseguin> give me an hour or so
[13:45:47] <johnbender> gseguin: I already merged though :(
[13:45:57] <gseguin> oh
[13:46:08] <johnbender> gseguin: I can put the ui mobile rendering thing in place until you want to get down to it I suppose
[13:46:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[13:46:19] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I thought of it after the fact
[13:46:35] <johnbender> gseguin: the ui-mobile-rendering change is just a quick find and sed
[13:46:50] <gseguin> although having a fouc on /test is not too big of deal is it
[13:46:50] <gseguin> ?
[13:47:04] <johnbender> gseguin: find docs/ -type f -name "*.html" -exec sed -i 's/<html>/<html class="ui-mobile-rendering">/' {} \;
[13:47:07] <johnbender> nope
[13:47:09] <gseguin> I mean for the time being
[13:47:16] <johnbender> but I'm asking todd
[13:47:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: need your yay or nay on this one
[13:49:16] <johnbender> gseguin: toddmparker_: kinblas: Wilto: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGVjdTZIQkdwQXUtWmRkQmRVeTdwVWc6MQ
[13:49:30] <johnbender> I was going to submit a jqm intro talk
[13:49:36] <johnbender> they've changed the format
[13:49:43] <gseguin> sounds good
[13:49:48] <Wilto> Yeah, do it up.
[13:49:53] <johnbender> if one of you is interested in nominating me I'd be most appreciative
[13:49:56] <gseguin> I'll submit a request for Bender
[13:50:03] <johnbender> thanks much
[13:51:39] <gseguin> johnbender: category: mobile or nerdcore ?
[13:51:49] <johnbender> gseguin: mobile in this case
[13:51:57] <gseguin> :D
[13:52:04] <johnbender> gah I have so many talks to give
[13:52:11] <johnbender> I was going to submit my functors in js too
[13:52:14] * johnbender sighs
[13:52:19] <johnbender> that would be nerdcore
[13:54:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: !
[13:54:36] * johnbender is waiting on the go ahead
[13:54:50] <Wilto> For the talk?
[13:55:11] <johnbender> no for the ui-mobile-rendering until gseguin has a chance to take care of adding it to jqm-docs.js
[13:55:29] <Wilto> Oh, oh. He’s on a call—I say go ahead.
[14:01:13] <johnbender> gseguin: arg, I forgot about the experiments too :P
[14:01:27] <gseguin> oops me too
[14:03:48] <kinblas> Wilto: toddmparker_: I updated https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2933 with the idea and our findings
[14:03:48] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2933 on jquery-mobile, reported by dmfallak (2m, 11h ago): get_orientation() and hence getScreenHeight() doesn't work on some devices
[14:04:03] <toddmparker_> sorry kin, on a call - be off in a bit
[14:08:17] <johnbender> gseguin: alright the rest of the tests directory is sorted
[14:08:25] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm just stubbing in these cases

[14:09:14] <johnbender> hmm
[14:09:18] <johnbender> the experiments directory
[14:09:19] <johnbender> ...
[14:11:38] <gseguin> johnbender: sounds good
[14:11:54] <johnbender> unmaintained
[14:11:56] <johnbender> so brutal
[14:11:57] <johnbender> lol
[14:14:19] <johnbender> gseguin: alright I think thats it
[14:14:38] <gseguin> drum roll
[14:15:11] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[14:15:23] <johnbender> gseguin: maybe it's better to just include the stub in the index.php file
[14:15:27] <johnbender> sigh
[14:15:32] <johnbender> I wish I'd thought of that sooner
[14:15:59] <gseguin> that would be a good idea indeed
[14:21:27] <johnbender> gseguin: removing the stubbing from elsewhere now
[14:26:33] <johnbender> gseguin: running the tests one more time before I destroy the universe
[14:26:42] <johnbender> then I'll push
[14:27:04] <gseguin> yay!
[14:35:05] <johnbender> and the monkey pushes the button
[14:35:29] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: kinblas: gseguin: AMD has landed
[14:35:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 7 new commits to master: http://git.io/1G22Bw
[14:35:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge branch 'amd' - John Bender
[14:35:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] fix async loading select test issue where keepnative isn't defined in time for the leading test - John Bender
[14:35:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] switch to explicit false check to avoid undefined issues - John Bender
[14:35:47] <kinblas> great!
[14:35:55] <gseguin> http://wil.to/_/button.gif
[14:36:00] <gseguin> YAY!
[14:36:21] <johnbender> gseguin: my sollution was to just add js/jquery.mobile.define.js into the index.php
[14:36:42] <gseguin> ok
[14:36:51] <gseguin> that sounds reasonable
[14:36:59] <johnbender> hopefully we'll be able to discard that in the not too distant future
[14:37:17] <johnbender> time to go to the bathroom I've been hacking non stop since 8am
[14:37:17] <johnbender> :D
[14:37:32] <gseguin> :)
[14:37:41] <toddmparker_> WOOOHOOOO
[14:40:31] <toddmparker_> ok kinblas - i'm off my call, sorry
[14:40:49] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it's ok, It's my off-jqm day anyways :-)
[14:40:59] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I put all the info in the bug
[14:41:06] <toddmparker_> yeah, reading
[14:41:19] <toddmparker_> i like putting all this info in the issues
[14:41:23] <kinblas> toddmparker_: let me know if you think it's doable
[14:41:25] <toddmparker_> good reference, public too
[14:41:31] <toddmparker_> our tracker has great seo
[14:41:43] <toddmparker_> when googling a bug, i usually just find out issues :)
[14:41:45] <kinblas> aka google
[14:42:32] <toddmparker_> i think that's ann interesting idea for sure
[14:42:56] <kinblas> I think it will allow us to dynamically figure out the mapping fo'sho
[14:43:39] <toddmparker_> i like, Wilto seems to think it may work
[14:43:46] <toddmparker_> you wanna give it a go?
[14:43:50] <Wilto> Yeah, I dig kinblas’ plan.
[14:44:37] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I can give it a go maybe later tonight I'm doin' Muse today
[14:44:53] <toddmparker_> ok
[14:44:56] <kinblas> but if Scott or Wilto want a go that's cool too
[14:45:02] <toddmparker_> what else did i miss?
[14:45:06] <toddmparker_> fast n furious in here
[14:45:20] <kinblas> I can crib scott's code from the transitions branch
[14:45:41] <Wilto> Either-or. If you don’t get a chance tonight/tomorrow I can tag in, but you’ll probably be quicker.
[14:45:56] <Wilto> s/probably/definitely
[14:49:03] <johnbender> aww I broke latest :(
[14:49:07] <johnbender> need to go update the modules
[14:49:56] <johnbender> or not because it's not a git repo :(
[14:51:06] <johnbender> nevermind again
[14:51:09] <johnbender> it is in fact a repo
[14:51:30] <Wilto> ?mlm
[14:51:31] <bot-t1> much like myself
[14:51:34] <gseguin> wait what?
[14:51:46] <Wilto> Hell if I know.
[14:51:57] <johnbender> gseguin: need to init and update the submodules on jquerymobile.com/test/
[14:52:11] <gseguin> oh yah that
[14:52:17] <gseguin> I almost mentionned it
[14:52:23] <johnbender> gseguin: :D
[14:52:35] <johnbender> well I knew too otherwise I wouldn't have been able to work on it
[14:52:46] <johnbender> bingo
[14:53:33] <johnbender> gseguin: need to go do that for the build server too
[14:53:38] <johnbender> I had that on my todo :P
[14:53:56] <gseguin> yup
[14:57:25] <johnbender> gseguin: arg
[14:57:33] <gseguin> 'sup?
[14:57:43] <johnbender> the adobe network doesn't like the git protocol
[14:57:59] <gseguin> OH
[14:58:22] <johnbender> changed lol
[14:58:43] <johnbender> .git/config is only altered on init I think so it should be minor
[14:58:50] <gseguin> the adobe network doesn't like a lot of things
[14:58:55] <johnbender> gseguin: true facts
[15:00:11] <johnbender> awrigt
[15:00:18] <johnbender> I can't think of anywhere else this matters
[15:01:44] <gseguin> so I still need to do a pass to inject docs.js instead of the ui-mobile-rendering class, right?
[15:01:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[15:02:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: while you were on the phone call I just altered the html tag to include the rendering class manually
[15:02:23] <johnbender> do you care enough to have gseguin do it in the js?
[15:02:24] <toddmparker_> oh, ok that works
[15:02:28] <toddmparker_> via the docs js?
[15:02:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: with find and sed :/
[15:02:43] <johnbender> but it doesn't have to stay that wa
[15:02:43] <toddmparker_> rather than in every html page?
[15:02:46] <toddmparker_> yeeps
[15:03:11] <toddmparker_> people will copy and paste page code and that is only needed in the docs, right?
[15:03:36] <toddmparker_> i'd vote to find a way to add it via docs.js to avoid confusion
[15:04:21] <gseguin> johnbender: we probably want to have a built version of the docs then
[15:04:28] <gseguin> for the release
[15:04:39] <gseguin> one not using requirejs
[15:05:38] <johnbender> I think we do
[15:05:45] <johnbender> I thought it compiled it
[15:05:54] <gseguin> not the docs
[15:06:09] <gseguin> thought that shouldn't be to big of a problem
[15:06:34] <johnbender> gseguin: can I ask a huge favor
[15:06:41] <johnbender> I have to step away from the comp for a couple minutes
[15:06:42] <gseguin> sure
[15:06:49] <johnbender> can you add a bit to the readme on the submodule update
[15:07:21] <gseguin> on master, right?

[15:24:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] First cut at making pop work for non-3D browsers. Still rough, but works. - toddparker
[15:24:22] <toddmparker_> woah
[15:24:25] <toddmparker_> ok, heading out
[15:24:39] <toddmparker_> i got the transitions looking ok on android in the fade in out branch
[15:24:48] <toddmparker_> see you tomorrow
[15:25:02] <gseguin> see ya
[15:32:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to fade-out-in-transition: http://git.io/YmlK0w
[15:32:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] Moved non-3D rules to the bottom to hide the ugliness - toddparker
[15:34:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we use the cdn for the docs to prevent load on the server right?
[15:34:51] <johnbender> we might want to switch back to non async then for the docs
[15:34:55] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm writing an init.sh script to init the submodules
[15:35:09] <gseguin> and checkout the right version of r.js and requirejs
[15:35:13] <johnbender> gseguin: won't that be more complicated than just running the git command?
[15:35:41] <gseguin> ./init.sh
[15:35:47] <gseguin> instead of:
[15:35:55] <gseguin> git submodule initialize
[15:36:04] <gseguin> git submodule update
[15:36:27] <gseguin> and that checks out master
[15:36:33] <gseguin> not version 1.0.3
[15:37:28] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[15:37:36] <johnbender> seems like we should be able to specify a commit or a tag
[15:37:45] <johnbender> not seeing it in the manpage though
[15:40:05] <johnbender> gseguin: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1777854/git-submodules-specify-a-branch-tag
[15:40:22] <johnbender> that seems to suggest we can do what I was suggesting but it's not obvious to me why that works
[15:40:58] <johnbender> gseguin: if you want to try that in the submodules then I can do a fetch and update to check where it's at
[15:41:56] <gseguin> I haven't done anything yet
[15:42:10] <gseguin> you can go ahead an pick up from there
[15:42:25] <johnbender> gseguin: ok so we want 1.0.3?
[15:42:34] <gseguin> I was reading about submodules as well
[15:42:37] <gseguin> yes 1.0.3
[15:42:50] <johnbender> gseguin: what about r.js?
[15:42:56] <gseguin> same
[15:44:27] <gseguin> Wilto: I started working on /dependencies without a names arg
[15:48:40] <johnbender> gseguin: when you made the initial commit with the submodules what was the state of the branch?
[15:49:06] <johnbender> err what was the state of each of the submodules
[15:49:14] <gseguin> I thought I had them checked out at 1.0.3 before pushing
[15:49:28] <johnbender> then it should be fine
[15:49:51] <gseguin> let me try again
[15:49:58] <johnbender> gseguin: yep
[15:49:59] <johnbender> works fine
[15:50:14] <johnbender> the newly inited and updated is at rev 1.0.3 on the build server
[15:50:24] <gseguin> oh ok cool!
[15:50:32] <johnbender> in which case its just git submodule update --init
[15:51:01] <gseguin> ok that's not too bad
[15:51:05] <johnbender> yah it will point at the commit you had it at when you commited
[15:51:16] <johnbender> confusing sentence is confusing
[15:51:42] <johnbender> anyway that's why it wasn't updating when I was attempting to checkout 1.0.3 lol
[15:51:45] <gseguin> alright so you take care of the README ?
[15:51:50] <johnbender> yessir!
[15:52:12] <gseguin> ok, back to my nodejs thing
[15:52:30] <johnbender> I was getting pissed
[15:52:40] <johnbender> "why isn't it showing the change to the submodule!"
[15:52:41] <johnbender> lol
[15:52:47] <gseguin> :)
[15:52:47] <Wilto> Nice, gseguin. Again, no big rush—no shortage of stuff to do on my side.
