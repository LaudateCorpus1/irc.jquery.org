[00:40:54] <frequent> uGoMobi: you around?
[00:41:04] <uGoMobi> frequent: yes
[00:41:08] <uGoMobi> good morning
[00:41:13] <frequent> good morning
[00:44:29] <frequent> I'm still fighting with the PR. I have cloned the 1.3-stable branch from JQM both inside my JQM repo and an external file & git remote set-url to my repo. I did not managed to push a commit because I'm ahead by 1 commit and when I pull, I get all sorts of conflicts (not only in table files).
[00:44:52] <frequent> that yellow-git belt surely is hard earned...
[00:45:01] <uGoMobi> :)
[00:47:17] <frequent> I will give it another try at noon.
[00:48:11] <uGoMobi> frequent: let me see if I can fix it with your current PR
[00:48:24] <uGoMobi> we have to get rid of that merge master commit
[00:48:45] <frequent> ok
[00:50:43] <frequent> I pretty much only replaced all "tableupdate" with "refresh" and did two  sample pages to test.
[00:58:45] <uGoMobi> frequent: I am cloning your fork of jquery-mobile to my local system
[00:58:50] <uGoMobi> one sec ... doorbell
[01:53:43] <uGoMobi> back
[01:54:48] <frequent> quite a walk to your doorbell :-D
[01:55:25] <uGoMobi> lol

[01:57:05] <uGoMobi> the one that you couldn't push
[01:57:34] <frequent> how to do?
[01:57:39] <uGoMobi> is it a lot of work to do that commit again?
[01:58:00] <frequent> no, I have the files in a backup folder, so just copy+replace the code.
[01:58:06] <uGoMobi> cool
[01:58:28] <uGoMobi> I created a new branch out of 1.3-stable on the jquery-mobile repo
[01:58:37] <frequent> ok
[01:58:49] <uGoMobi> can you update your forked repo
[01:59:05] <frequent> yes, hold on
[01:59:09] <uGoMobi> ok
[01:59:47] <frequent> will be 5min
[01:59:56] <uGoMobi> ok
[02:07:26] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok, I have updated my JQM repo and have the 1.3-stable branch
[02:07:55] <uGoMobi> frequent: do you also have the table-refresh-1.3 branch?
[02:08:43] <frequent> I have table-refresh  and table-refresh_1.3.1
[02:09:03] <uGoMobi> hmm.. that are the ones that you created
[02:09:08] <frequent> yup
[02:09:18] <frequent> the 1.3-stable is not the correct one?
[02:09:46] <uGoMobi> what do you see if you do $ git checkout table-refresh-1.3
[02:10:26] <uGoMobi> no, because your other commits aren't in 1.3-stable but in the table-refresh-1.3 branch that I created
[02:11:02] <frequent> I get: "Branch table-refresh-1.3 set up to track remote branch table-refresh-1.3 from upstream"

[04:49:09] <uGoMobi> really appreciated!
[04:52:33] <frequent> welcome.
[05:11:20] <arschmitz> hello
[05:11:56] <arschmitz> Morning uGoMobi: frequent:
[05:12:10] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:12:14] <frequent> morning
[05:12:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you happen to look at the widget punch list yesterday?
[05:13:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, where can I find it?
[05:13:19] <uGoMobi> wiki page?
[05:13:22] <frequent> arschmitz: you missed my whole gitravaganza... uGoMobi saved my day
[05:13:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit
[05:13:35] <arschmitz> still a work in progress
[05:14:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looking now
[05:15:04] <uGoMobi> had some IRC issues yesterday so I think I missed it, sorry
[05:15:20] <arschmitz> oh no thats ok just thought you would want to see it
[05:17:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: "Widgets should be stateful"... does that mean that you can always check current state of widget options?
[05:18:08] <arschmitz> that the widget should always reflect the current options
[05:18:14] <arschmitz> and that it should have a life cycle
[05:18:20] <uGoMobi> ah ok gotcha
[05:18:37] <arschmitz> its actualy one of the ui guidelines i cant take credit for that one :)\
[05:23:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was just checking john his post about documentFragments :)
[05:23:46] <arschmitz> ha ha
[05:24:01] <uGoMobi> I didn't know this
[05:24:06] <arschmitz> yeah i had meant to put that refrence in last night since some people might not be familier 
[05:24:12] <arschmitz> and realized it was missing
[05:24:42] <arschmitz> A lot of these really go for all our JS
[05:24:54] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:26:12] <arschmitz> almost feel like the performance section should be its own wiki
[05:27:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah good idea
[05:27:27] <uGoMobi> make a performance wiki page and paste it in there
[05:27:37] <arschmitz> im sure there is plenty that could be added to that as well but i think its a good start
[05:27:37] <uGoMobi> it's really a great document... nice work!
[05:27:44] <arschmitz> Thank you
[05:27:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure I understand this one "use widget pseudo selector to find other instances"
[05:27:58] <arschmitz> stuff iv been mulling over and brainstorming for a while
[05:28:03] <arschmitz> ah
[05:28:15] <arschmitz> widget factory makes a pseudo selector for all widgets
[05:28:19] <arschmitz> like
[05:28:22] <arschmitz> :slider
[05:28:40] <uGoMobi> cool
[05:28:42] <arschmitz> so for something like panel to make sure any other panels are closed before open
[05:29:01] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:29:01] <arschmitz> you can do $(".ui-page-active :panel").panel("close");
[05:29:19] <uGoMobi> good to know
[05:30:08] <arschmitz> i actualy took the time to read and learn the whole widget factory line by line basicly lol
[05:31:09] <uGoMobi> very useful
[05:31:16] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:31:21] <uGoMobi> I should go over the WF API docs again too
[05:31:33] <arschmitz> yeah there is a lot of good stuff in there
[05:31:47] <frequent> mind sharing the link?
[05:31:59] <uGoMobi> http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/
[05:32:05] <frequent> merci
[05:32:07] <arschmitz> before api.jqueryui.com there was never really any good documentation 
[05:32:14] <frequent> like in "thanks"
[05:32:23] <arschmitz> frequent you have actualy read portions already but may not have realized 
[05:32:33] <arschmitz> all the links i sent you for different methods were that page
[05:32:40] <frequent> yup.
[05:33:05] <frequent> so I will have a full read whenever time permits :-)
[05:33:33] <arschmitz> yeah its really good stuff if you plan on working with widgets
[05:35:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: punch list seems complete to me
[05:35:54] <frequent> hard to escape widgets when trying to contribute to JQM :-)
[05:36:11] <arschmitz> frequent yes very true
[05:37:18] <uGoMobi> well maybe one thing... 21. follow jQuery code style guidelines :)
[05:37:29] <arschmitz> add it
[05:41:58] <arschmitz> i am really intrested in the performance gains we can make 
[05:42:56] <arschmitz> i think combined with rethinking the css and markup we can make a huge difference 
[05:43:18] <arschmitz> Make JQM lean and mean HA HA
[05:43:34] <frequent> arschmitz: on some pages in my application, I'm sending fully enhanced markup from the server. It's fast...
[05:44:16] <arschmitz> frequent yea dom manipulation is about the most expensive thing you can do with js
[05:44:30] <arschmitz> thats why we need to try and minimize it
[05:45:02] <frequent> true
[05:45:13] <uGoMobi> currently we have 157 times addClass in our code
[05:45:29] <uGoMobi> let's count again in 1.4
[05:45:37] <arschmitz> addClass can be very good though
[05:45:44] <arschmitz> its much better then .css()
[05:45:56] <uGoMobi> right, saw that in your punch list :)
[05:46:12] <uGoMobi> but better would be.. no addClass and no .css()
[05:46:20] <arschmitz> but when possible i think these should be added by hand
[05:46:33] <arschmitz> it avoides dom minipulation and reflows / repaints
[05:46:40] <uGoMobi> yup
[05:48:50] <arschmitz> i bet if we went throguh all our selectors following the rules in there we could make a LOT of them a lot more effecient

[07:37:58] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: thanks for the pointer
[07:46:31] <toddmparker> arschmitz: doc is looking good
[07:46:49] <arschmitz> toddmparker: really bulked up the performance section
[07:47:15] <toddmparker> 22. Check to ensure the API docs and demos are in sync with the final widget code
[07:47:20] <uGoMobi_> frequent: arschmitz : we have to look at the unit tests https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5854
[07:47:20] <toddmparker> yeah, that's great
[07:47:31] <arschmitz> toddmparker: though now im kinda thinking this should be its own wiki because its not widget specific at all
[07:47:48] <toddmparker> re: frequent's mention, should we have a flag to say pre-enhanced markup in place?
[07:48:23] <toddmparker> so for widgets like the slider that will have html enhancement, you could generate the final source and set that flag?
[07:48:35] <toddmparker> would that speed things up?
[07:48:41] <arschmitz> yes
[07:48:47] <frequent> it does for me
[07:48:58] <arschmitz> its eliminates almost all the dom manipulation
[07:49:01] <toddmparker> might be good to add that as an idea to this docs
[07:49:07] <arschmitz> which is the most expensive part
[07:49:12] <toddmparker> and discuss with scott g.
[07:49:17] <toddmparker> how to best do it
[07:49:27] <frequent> I have also tinkered with this quite a lot on server-side
[07:49:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ill add it as an idea at bottom
[07:49:52] <arschmitz> its simple to implement
[07:50:02] <arschmitz> just as a data-attribute
[07:50:05] <toddmparker> seems most useful if doing client-side templating since PE isn't a factor
[07:51:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker useful anywhere really
[07:51:17] <arschmitz> if your pages all come from server essentially preenhanced
[07:51:24] <arschmitz> it will make page loads a LOT faster
[07:51:39] <arschmitz> all you will be doing is attaching event binding pretty much
[07:52:25] <arschmitz> eliminates almost all repaints / reflows
[07:53:33] <toddmparker> arschmitz: i added a "possible additions" at the end
[07:53:41] <arschmitz> ok
[07:53:56] <toddmparker> we should discuss, decide and add these to the top of the doc as things you should always do
[07:54:15] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:54:34] <toddmparker> what other ways can we speed things up if devs want to take on more of the burden
[07:55:10] <frequent>  I'm dropping sending almost empty page head on every one but the first page request
[07:55:40] <toddmparker> that works as long as you know people won't deep link to other pages
[07:55:56] <arschmitz> use server side ajax check
[07:56:02] <frequent> yup
[07:56:04] <arschmitz> i already do that on all my jqm pages
[07:56:09] <frequent> me too
[07:56:15] <toddmparker> you could set up the server to be smarter and only return the page container if it's an ajax request
[07:56:17] <arschmitz> only send page div if its ajax
[07:56:22] <toddmparker> cool
[07:56:23] <frequent> you can also to it on the client
[07:56:33] <toddmparker> do we have a demo for that? seems like an important concept 
[07:56:43] <arschmitz> i dont think so easy to set up thoug
[07:56:54] <frequent> Coldfusion server, RequireJS client I could provide
[07:56:54] <arschmitz> another major one is kinda already in there
[07:57:10] <arschmitz> allowthings to live outside page
[07:57:18] <arschmitz> headers / panels / popups
[07:57:42] <arschmitz> for potentially global things like this its expensive to send with every page
[07:57:49] <arschmitz> and enhance and bind with every single page
[08:02:02] <frequent> arschmitz: I have tried to building headers on the client from a template. Not really super flexible (I can pass in JSON config for translations), but when the header does not change across pages, then no need to send it even when it's inside the page
[08:10:50] <arschmitz> frequent: i have a branch that allows you to do true persistant toolbars 
[08:10:59] <arschmitz> they are not part of the page object
[08:11:03] <frequent> hm.
[08:11:05] <gseguin> mornin'
[08:11:07] <arschmitz> so they never change move transition at all
[08:11:34] <frequent> nice. A lot of fiddling to enhance the header outside the page?
[08:11:45] <frequent> it's even a lot of fiddling inside ... :-)
[08:11:59] <arschmitz> not really there are other changes to make it work nice
[08:12:05] <arschmitz> like no more page.sections
[08:12:27] <arschmitz> content stuff is part of page widget and header footer stuff is in a new toolbar widget
[08:12:40] <frequent> sounds good
[08:13:04] <arschmitz> so all you will need to do is call $(selector).toolbar(); on dom ready
[08:13:10] <frequent> because things in toolbars do add up... 
[08:13:18] <arschmitz> not supporting autoinit on stuff outside pages
[08:29:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: css preprocessor talk again sounds like they might have a cool build tool on the way

[09:28:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm going to take a look at the panels in IE
[09:29:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit
[09:30:01] <arschmitz> added a bunch if you want to take a look
[09:30:21] <arschmitz> mostly performance related
[09:30:53] <johnbender> arschmitz: it might be good to pick the top 10 so that people have an attainable goal
[09:30:57] <johnbender> arschmitz: or top 5
[09:31:03] <johnbender> an then everything else is a nice to have
[09:31:13] <johnbender> (even if it's more than "nice" to have)
[09:33:03] <frequent> uGoMobi: thx. well spotted...
[09:39:58] <uGoMobi_> frequent: there is still something wrong with the column toggle refresh test
[09:40:17] <uGoMobi_> had to do something else first... will look at that later
[09:41:44] <frequent> I think the start() tag should be outside of the input trigger. let me try.
[10:26:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi: you might be able to test this locally too but my manual bisect shows 2ca372d6393f10fd7be87e8f24b085ed5dad1c72
[10:26:26] <johnbender> as the point at which it's broken in the docs
[10:26:53] <johnbender> there's another orthogonal issue in nearby commits with the class object property which IE doesn't like
[10:27:11] <johnbender> but correcting for that seems to suggest that commit as the problem
[10:30:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi: the commit before that says the panels are fine
[10:31:35] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: strange... I see nothing panel related in that commit
[10:31:57] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: yah
[10:36:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: if you have a second to test that commit and the one before it HEAD~ it would be good to verify what I'm seeing
[10:36:45] <johnbender> arschmitz: ^
[10:37:02] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: ok
[10:42:23] <toddmparker> i better get an agenda going
[10:46:35] <johnbender> toddmparker: yar
[10:47:27] <toddmparker> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eRV96_a3icASmUXOrb1cbtqy5dfyyqH-b1VaR2EYlw0/edit
[10:48:30] <toddmparker> arschmitz: I think I messed up permissions on that doc
[10:48:38] <arschmitz> oh no
[10:48:43] <toddmparker> i changed it so it was public, but not editable
[10:48:51] <toddmparker> which google let me do
[10:48:59] <arschmitz> lol
[10:49:02] <toddmparker> then i kick dmd out of editing :(
[10:49:10] <toddmparker> seems like a bug
[10:49:19] <arschmitz> nah its fine 
[10:49:23] <arschmitz> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit
[10:49:37] <arschmitz> still world writeable
[10:50:03] <toddmparker> johnbender: do you know the story with http://topcoat.io/topcoat/doc/mobile.html
[10:50:22] <johnbender> toddmparker: should I for some reason?
[10:50:46] <johnbender> toddmparker: ah it's from adobe
[10:50:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think you just made a copy of the file that was locked for editing
[10:50:48] <toddmparker> it's an adobe project
[10:51:00] <toddmparker> a RWD UI framework
[10:51:16] <toddmparker> with separate desktop and mobile designs
[10:51:20] <johnbender> toddmparker: there was some discussion about something like that a while ago and I was looped in but I'm not sure if it's the same thing and I haven't been consulted since
[10:51:29] <toddmparker> gotcha
[10:51:36] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'll dig around
[10:51:48] <toddmparker> i like this flatter style, i want to make a theme in this direction for 1.4
[10:51:55] <toddmparker> johnbender: thanks, just curious
[10:52:07] <johnbender> toddmparker: np np
[11:00:18] <toddmparker> ok, meeting time
[11:00:41] <gseguin> toddmparker: just opened the room, I'll be right back
[11:01:50] <johnbender> it's an open source ui kit and I think t hey're trying to standardize on it internally
[11:02:03] <johnbender> toddmparker: ^ don't know if that will happen or not
[11:09:50] <rdavidwu_> hi toddmparker
[11:13:38] <toddmparker> hi rdavidwu_ 
[11:13:53] <toddmparker> johnbender: gotcha
[11:16:12] <rdavidwu_> are there any updates regarding the top and bottom panel?
[12:00:55] <toddmparker> we've been heads down on more nuts and bolts stuff for 1.4
[12:01:27] <toddmparker> it's possible this will end up in 1.5 and not 1.4. trying to not add much in the way of new stuff since we're re-factoring. but this will go in for sure.
[12:01:36] <toddmparker> it's slick as hell
[12:02:21] <toddmparker> guess we could add this as a demo at first to get it out in the wild sooner
[12:07:24] <mspisars> toddmparker: when is 1.4 scheduled for release (approx.)?
[12:09:12] <rdavidwu_> oh ok. well i was just wondering if you guys had the chance of looking at the code. I had to add some of the css styles in the js code to make the panel have different sizes
[12:09:58] <rdavidwu_> and was wondering if that was too messy to have
[12:12:13] <rdavidwu_> i think at this point it seems to be the only way of making the panels re-size 
[12:24:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually this should be easy for panel transitions
[12:24:50] <arschmitz> you already wrap all the content 
[12:24:54] <toddmparker> rdavidwu_: yeah, I think the way you did it is the only option if we have variable heights and css animations
[12:25:02] <arschmitz> if its outside the page the wrapped content would be the page
[12:25:05] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: I first finish the table unit tests and then I check IE panel
[12:25:18] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: true
[12:25:36] <uGoMobi_> no more content wrapper
[12:25:41] <arschmitz> so i think we just would need to short circut the wrapping and point it to the page and done
[12:26:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker: have you talked anymore to scott_gonzalez or should i try and catch him or ???
[12:27:50] <johnbender> toddmparker: looking into that nav issue
[12:27:53] <mspisars> toddmparker: FYI, I am interested in helping with any refactoring that needs it. But I would ask for smallish tasks so that I don't end up sitting on them too long
[12:29:20] <mspisars> i have a jqm sandbox setup, and ready, so it just becomes an exercise of allocating time..
[12:31:03] <rdavidwu_> toddmparker: yea thats what i figured. However, i did not add the case when the panels dont use animations. So I would need to add those cases to the js code as well. 
[12:32:06] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15toddparker opened issue #5855: Expose an option for whether we hide the URL bar/browser chrome in iOS and Android  02http://git.io/tOMNCA
[12:34:21] <toddmparker> ^^ I think that one feature adds a lot of glitchyness
[12:34:28] <toddmparker> not needed in a webview
[12:34:39] <arschmitz> true for webview its pointless 
[12:34:46] <arschmitz> but will that happen in webview
[12:34:52] <arschmitz> since reader is not an option in webview
[12:34:57] <toddmparker> think so
[12:35:10] <toddmparker> no but we're still scrolling the doc around needlessly
[12:35:12] <arschmitz> weird because its reader causing it
[12:35:19] <toddmparker> which can interfere with transitions
[12:35:26] <arschmitz> true
[12:35:42] <toddmparker> mspisars: cool, you could tackle a widget and try to get it up to standards as time allows
[12:35:45] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: arschmitz: toddmparker: ping
[12:35:50] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5284
[12:36:07] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah, mind reaching out to scott_gonzalez and seeing if he wants to review that with you and anyone else around
[12:36:11] <johnbender> whatever is relying on $.mobile.pageContainer needs to be inside a pagecontainercreate
[12:36:12] <toddmparker> yes johnbender 
[12:36:14] <johnbender> binding
[12:37:00] <johnbender> I can't get it to reproduce in chrome but there is at least one other issue
[12:37:11] <johnbender> which I am working on now
[12:38:17] <toddmparker> ok
[12:38:38] <mspisars> toddmparker: or anyone here, which widget should I take on? which ones are not refactored yet?
[12:38:52] <mspisars> is there a list?
[12:38:56] <arschmitz> none are refactored
[12:39:02] <arschmitz> all need to be reviewed
[12:39:28] <johnbender> toddmparker: hmm the broader problem seems to be that it's responding to the the initial popstate with an ajax request of the initial page
[12:39:38] <johnbender> this is something the _|Nix|_ and I were working on
[12:39:42] <johnbender> not sure if his changes are in there
[12:42:33] <johnbender> they are
[12:42:34] <johnbender> hmm
[12:42:40] <johnbender> this is the inital popstate on returning to the page
[12:42:45] <johnbender> which we need to deal with 
[12:42:47] <johnbender> hrm hrm hrm
[12:42:56] <johnbender> I'm going to have to think about this one for a bit
[13:05:16] <toddmparker> johnbender: ok. it always gets complicated with pop state
[13:05:27] <toddmparker> johnbender: opinions here? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/1219
[13:11:50] <gseguin> toddmparker: I was going to question the unused option
[13:11:54] <gseguin> I see the benefit
[13:12:12] <gseguin> but the problem is that it also flags function arguments that are not used
[13:12:27] <gseguin> which kinda sucks
[13:12:44] <gseguin> though I guess we could C comment these out
[13:13:19] <gseguin> but generally I agree with having some common rules accross jQuery projects
[13:29:37] <toddmparker> yeah, I'm all for consistency
[13:29:50] <toddmparker> feel free to add thoughts there. it's a discussion.
[13:30:08] <gseguin> following it
[13:38:06] <johnbender> toddmparker: seems like a good investement of time
[13:45:26] <arschmitz> ok anyone who wants to look got some feed back on best practices doc from scott gonzalez lots of comments on there and a few updates

[15:28:14] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: I figured it out... http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/iewebdevelopment/thread/ad1b6e88-bbfa-4cc4-9e95-3889b82a7c1d/
[15:28:41] <uGoMobi_> IE only allows a max of 32 @imports
[15:30:24] <uGoMobi_> in the commit that you found another @import has been added https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/2ca372d6393f10fd7be87e8f24b085ed5dad1c72#L1R28
[15:31:22] <uGoMobi_> that made panel the 33th because structure.css on itself is also included with an @import
[15:38:04] <uGoMobi_> ah, I now read a comment that says there is a limit of 31 on a page... if so we can fix it by splitting it up :)
[15:40:46] <uGoMobi_> gseguin|away: are you around?
[15:45:23] <uGoMobi_> confirmed... if I move transitions to a separate file it works on IE
[15:46:38] <toddmparker> Bizarre 
[15:47:02] <toddmparker> Sounds like we need a different way to merge the CSS
[15:47:23] <toddmparker> @imports are just for Dev, right? 
[15:51:49] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: yeah, just local
[15:51:58] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: but it's easy to fix
[15:52:18] <uGoMobi_> I moved transitions to a separate file
[15:52:26] <toddmparker> Whatcha gonna do 
[15:52:35] <uGoMobi_> so we stay below 31 @imports on a page
[15:52:46] <toddmparker> Ah, so there is a file that rolls all those together?
[15:53:01] <uGoMobi_> yeah 
[15:53:07] <toddmparker> Cool
[15:53:23] <toddmparker> Dumb limitation but @imports are bad anyway
[15:53:39] <toddmparker> 31 requests is 30 too many
[15:53:54] <toddmparker> Back in a bit
[15:53:56] <uGoMobi_> true
[15:54:07] <toddmparker> Saw you finished tests?
