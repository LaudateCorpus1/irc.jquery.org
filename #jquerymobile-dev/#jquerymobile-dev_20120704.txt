[02:09:00] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi !
[02:09:03] <MauriceG> Hi Anne!
[02:09:22] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[02:09:40] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: I just saw your comment at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3998
[02:09:41] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3998 on jquery-mobile (H2Os; 2m, 3w ago): <button> and <a> different font size in footer
[02:10:07] <MauriceG> so the release notes for 1.1.1-rc1 also wrong?
[02:10:46] <uGoMobi> Yeah I think so
[02:11:19] <uGoMobi> I don't see the changed code in the 1.1-stable branch
[02:13:34] <MauriceG> ok. I'm working on the notes for 1.2a. For this I was asking.
[02:14:46] <uGoMobi> we might to decide to pick it for 1.1.1 final
[02:20:19] <agcolom> Hi Maurice, Hi Jasper :-)
[02:20:43] <MauriceG> Hi Anne !
[02:20:59] <MauriceG> Nice to see you!
[02:21:32] <agcolom> and you :-)
[02:21:43] <MauriceG> Hope your back is better !
[02:21:54] <uGoMobi> good morning Anne
[02:22:31] <agcolom> it's really bad today, so I am in bed! took meds and everything.... still really bad... must have done too much yesterday!
[02:23:19] <agcolom> How is everyone?
[02:24:30] <MauriceG> very sorry Anne :-(
[02:28:32] <MauriceG> Thanks!  I was at school with my son this morning. They have "Knigge-Day" today.  The teacher asked me to take some flowers from the classroom cause of holidays.
[02:28:40] <MauriceG> I should had say no ...
[02:29:35] <MauriceG> My Jeep was full of palms ... It was like a jungle ...
[02:30:55] <agcolom> Fantastic! Sounds great! How old is your son?
[02:31:26] <agcolom> Take a picture of the plants :-)
[02:31:27] <MauriceG> eleven (also a lego fan ;-)
[02:32:21] <agcolom> ah! Alex is 10... yes, legos are great! but when I was little i was only building houses with them...
[02:32:49] <agcolom> I didn't have the imagination they have... and I had never seen a candy machine at that age anyway!
[02:33:33] <MauriceG> my son likes flowers (carnivorous plants in special)  so if the teacher asks, he say we will take.  We have now 9 plants from the school ...
[02:34:15] <agcolom> Wahou!!!! That's amazing! So do you have to bring them back in september?
[02:34:50] <MauriceG> yes. after the holidays
[02:35:03] <agcolom> I did look after my school mouse once for the Easter holiday. My cat was completely mad!
[02:35:18] <agcolom> So are you going to be going on holiday soon?
[02:35:18] <MauriceG> :-)
[02:36:56] <MauriceG> Maybe yes. My family wants, but me not ...  I think we go to spain (Majorca)   I have a friend there.
[02:41:20] <agcolom> That sounds nice! I can't wait to be on holiday and escape this terrible English summer (Again the forecast is rain for the next 5 days!)
[02:43:02] <MauriceG> puuh ...   Here the weather is ok (until now!).  So, why go to spain ...
[02:46:54] <agcolom> We'll be going to the south of France (my parent's house) where everything is better: the house, the garden, the weather and the food.... so for me It's an easy decision :-)
[02:47:19] <agcolom> and of course I forgot the wine ;-)
[02:54:53] <MauriceG> I like France. I was in Nice and Monaco, but long ago ...
[02:55:50] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I just commented on your PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4643
[02:55:51] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1h, 5m ago): Header Buttons: Support submit, reset, and input buttons in header toolbars
[02:56:26] <MauriceG> yeah, thanks!  I saw right now.
[02:56:54] <uGoMobi> what do you think?
[02:58:28] <uGoMobi> do you know if adding more elements to the selector affects performance?
[03:10:49] <MauriceG> I just know that the use of CSS selectors is the fastest way. And I don't know if jQuery searches the given object multiple times for each selector. May this depends on the browser also.
[03:11:33] <MauriceG> If you think there is no need, it will be better to keep as is.    May we close and wait until more people complain about submit buttons in the header.
[03:11:43] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: ^
[03:12:20] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: Ok
[03:16:07] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: It seems you're afraid of 350  ;-)
[03:16:40] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: lol
[03:17:24] <uGoMobi> actually it's not that "350" is the magic number
[03:18:02] <uGoMobi> it's more about whether the count is going up or down
[03:18:36] <uGoMobi> with upcomming releases we can expect more than average new issues
[03:19:31] <uGoMobi> so we have to try hard to stay at least at the same open issue count
[03:34:28] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: If you were not here, the counter would be the double...  I've to ask Anne, if I should close my open PRs.
[03:34:38] <MauriceG> agcolom: ^
[03:53:35] <agcolom> Hi!
[05:41:53] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: you said you are working on 1.2 release notes, right?
[05:42:46] <uGoMobi> there were two things I removed from 1.1.1. because we thought it was better to wait for 1.2
[05:42:52] <uGoMobi> those are...
[05:45:08] <uGoMobi> full width forms: when you use fieldcontain the form element is now 60% width and the label 20% + 2% margin-right. This has been changed to 78% so the form will be full width
[05:46:09] <uGoMobi> and the second one is... added padding for grouped icon-only buttons

[07:20:20] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Buttons: Changed to the selector for mini buttons. Because of other changes it is no longer needed to have .ui-btn in the selector. To avoid regression because of the higher level of specificity it's better to stick to just .ui-mini. [1.1.2.] - Jasper de Groot
[07:25:00] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: could you look into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4645 ? Thanks!
