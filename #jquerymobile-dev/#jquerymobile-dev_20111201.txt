[09:01:07] <gseguin> 'morning
[09:02:34] <gseguin> eddiemonge: ping
[09:03:39] <eddiemonge> hi
[09:04:10] <gseguin> hey is NodeJS available on the machine that "builds" our code?
[09:05:37] <gseguin> eddiemonge: ^
[09:05:49] <eddiemonge> probably
[09:05:55] <eddiemonge> if not it could be
[09:06:18] <gseguin> ok cool
[09:06:53] <eddiemonge> you thinking of converting the build process to node/ant?
[09:07:21] <garann> can we do that?
[09:07:27] <gseguin> working on using AMD to handle the dependencies
[09:08:20] <gseguin> and RequireJS/r.js work with NodeJS (or Rhino)
[09:08:47] <gseguin> and get rid of our dependency on PHP
[09:09:23] <eddiemonge> that sounds more complicated and replaces one dependency with another
[09:09:48] <gseguin> well the dependency on Node is just for building
[09:10:00] <eddiemonge> we only depend on php for two things, concating the files used for /test/ and for handling that one form
[09:10:07] <gseguin> for development you'll just need an HTTP server
[09:10:11] <gseguin> no more PHP
[09:10:22] <eddiemonge> i think we could use mockjax to get rid of the form and the concating part isnt really a problem
[09:11:10] <gseguin> but the longer term project is being able to pick and choose what you want in your build
[09:11:52] <gseguin> having our dependencies clearly laid out will help us do that
[09:13:21] <eddiemonge> yeah thats a big one
[09:13:35] <eddiemonge> that would be huge and super helpful having the dependencies clearly defined
[09:14:07] <gseguin> that's why I'm using AMD
[09:17:09] <eddiemonge> i think even just specifying something simple like " jqm.requires( ajax.core ) " would be a super helpful start
[09:17:37] <gseguin> yeah, I don't want to re-invent the wheel
[09:18:02] <gseguin> I think using CommonJS standards make sense here
[09:18:37] <gseguin> unless there is a huge drawback which I don't know of
[09:19:10] <eddiemonge> whats commonJS using? ive only looked at requireJS (well the version dojo is using)
[09:20:06] <gseguin> AMD is a CommonJS standard, RequireJS is just the most popular AMD loader but there are others
[09:20:22] <gseguin> you work with dojo, right?
[09:20:48] <gseguin> brb
[09:23:43] <gseguin> back
[09:42:13] <eddiemonge> well that was odd. my computer decided to not let half the internet traffic go through
[09:43:23] <eddiemonge> whatd i miss?
[09:43:34] <gseguin> not much
[09:43:44] <gseguin> I was asking you if you were using dojo?
[09:44:19] <eddiemonge> at work yeah
[09:45:03] <gseguin> yeah so what I've done so far is wrap our modules within a define()
[09:45:39] <gseguin> and then I use a hacked version of r.js to build
[09:48:13] <eddiemonge> is that using node.js to process it or where does that dependency come in?
[09:48:37] <gseguin> yeah you need nodejs to run r.js
[09:49:39] <gseguin> you're suppose to be able to use rhino but I've had problems with rhino that I don't have with node
[09:57:26] <eddiemonge> im afraid of swapping one dependancy for another. especially one that is harder to get up and running
[09:59:39] <gseguin> Node is required only to build
[09:59:58] <gseguin> whereas PHP is required to develop, right now
[10:00:17] <gseguin> which is a pain in the butt
[10:01:34] <gseguin> using RequireJS in dev mode is so much more convenient for debugging because you actually have your modules as such in your debugger
[10:01:47] <gseguin> not the PHP combined file
[10:02:35] <gseguin> and really the only machine that needs node installed is the build machine
[10:03:34] <gseguin> I'll push in a branch in a few
[10:03:43] <gseguin> you can try it out
[10:17:04] <eddiemonge> thatd be good. im curious to see it in action
[10:17:31] <eddiemonge> would the build still minify and stuff? or would gcomp still be needed?
[10:27:47] <gseguin> yep it uses UglifyJS
[10:28:11] <gseguin> actually the minified version is a little smaller than the current one
[10:29:19] <Wilto> Hey guys.
[10:29:19] <bot-t> (27 hours 8 mins ago) <imjoshdean> tell wilto: my hyrule map shipped.
[10:29:37] <Wilto> I am known internet-wide for my love of Zelda, it seems.
[10:29:51] <gseguin> 'morning Wilto
[10:30:31] <Wilto> What’s the rumpus? Anything new? I’m just prototypin’ away on that AJAX-y plugin Todd and I have been talking about.
[10:31:02] <gseguin> not much here, still working on the dependency thing
[10:31:11] <gseguin> do we have a meeting today?
[10:31:17] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ^
[10:31:39] <Wilto> Todd’s out at the moment, but far as I know yeah.
[10:33:01] <gseguin> hey great work on movethewebforward, btw
[10:33:10] <Wilto> Oh, thanks man!
[10:33:23] <Wilto> It was a scramble. I made sure to put a “help with jQM” plug in there, though.
[10:33:48] <gseguin> I saw that
[10:37:01] <Wilto> But yeah, some titans working on that thing. I just did my best to keep up.
[10:39:46] <garann> toddmparker_: i'm just commenting out the pieces that are dynamically positioning the headers/footers - is that what you want?
[10:43:36] <Wilto> garann: Yeah—we’re looking to eliminate all the hack-y stuff we have in place to try to fake position: fixed;
[10:43:53] <Wilto> garann: Did Todd point you at Brad Frost’s research?
[10:44:04] <garann> yeah
[10:44:51] <Wilto> Ah, cool. Yeah, the plan is to kinda let the chips fall where they may, support-wise.
[10:45:00] <garann> i wasn't sure if y'all wanted to test by eliminating all this code, or just the positioning, or just some or all depending on UA sniffing, or..... ?
[10:45:10] <Wilto> I dunno if he wants to scratch out the overflow-scroll stuff for iOS.
[10:46:10] <Wilto> Ideally, I think we just want to put position: fixed; in there and let it play out how it plays out. More and more, the gadgets that don’t support it are just falling back to position: static behavior.
[10:47:36] <garann> you mean put position:fixed in and eliminate all the js?
[10:47:47] <garann> cause the js will mess that up real quick..
[10:48:12] <garann> sorry if i'm being thick - not sure how you guys usually do this sort of thing :/
[10:50:18] <eddiemonge> what? break stuff?
[10:50:21] <eddiemonge> all the time
[10:50:29] <Wilto> That is kinda how we roll.
[10:51:01] <Wilto> Hang on, Todd should be in momentarily.
[10:51:23] <garann> ok, cool
[10:56:36] <kinblas> toddmparker_: Wilto: I'm guessing you guys will paste the meeting URL here right?
[10:56:50] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, meeting time.
[10:57:35] <eddiemonge> https://plus.google.com/hangouts/extras/eddiemonge.com/jquery%2520mobile
[10:59:21] <toddmparker_> hey all
[10:59:28] <toddmparker_> meetin' time is right
[10:59:32] <Wilto> Nice of you to join us, slacker!
[10:59:42] <Wilto> i’m fired again aren’t i
[10:59:46] <toddmparker_> garann - we can talk about that on the call
[11:06:55] <kinblas> is just me or is Todd's voice fading in and out?
[11:37:03] <eddiemonge> have you tried, or would it matter, to set the new page height to the screen height, and hide the rest of the page and then restore it when the transition is done?
[12:12:44] <Wilto> It’s likely it’d still happen since it’s gonna parse the whole set of stylesheets anyway, y’know?
[12:13:13] <Wilto> Update: my fetchlink stuff is pretty damn broken, so hold off before takin’ a look. Working on that now.
[12:13:26] <Wilto> kinblas: (Don’t tell anyone I’m working on that now.)
[12:15:01] <kinblas> heh
[12:18:48] <Wilto> I figure Ethan _probably_ has the whole “talking about RWD” thing handled.
[13:05:24] <gseguin> toddmparker_: so I've pushed my thing into the amd branch
[13:05:36] <gseguin> there is an issue with styling
[13:05:49] <gseguin> the links look weird
[13:05:56] <gseguin> I'm looking into it
