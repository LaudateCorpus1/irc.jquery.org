[02:13:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Typo minor - forresst
[02:13:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #4601 from forresst/patch-1 - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[10:00:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to test the deploy for stable today and make sure things are sorted
[10:00:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: am I free to tag it?
[10:01:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: also, the deploy should be fine since I didn't make the makefile changes to 1.1-stable that I've made to master
[10:01:08] <johnbender> in theory
[10:01:12] <johnbender> should be zero pain
[10:01:18] <johnbender> though I've thought that before :(
[10:01:21] <gseguin> johnbender: don't forget version.txt
[10:04:33] <johnbender> I won't
[10:05:06] <johnbender> gseguin: that is, thanks for reminding me, now I won't :D
[10:05:19] <gseguin> heh :)
[10:06:27] <johnbender> gseguin: did the change that tracks the version text in the top right banner make it into the 1.1-stable branch?
[10:06:45] * gseguin checks
[10:07:32] <gseguin> johnbender: nope
[10:07:38] <johnbender> gseguin: gseguin good to know
[10:07:41] <johnbender> is it an image?
[10:07:52] <johnbender> gseguin: lol
[10:07:53] <gseguin> toddmparker_, Wilto: we need a banner for 1.1.1
[10:07:54] <johnbender> checking myself
[10:08:00] <johnbender> yrp
[10:08:02] <gseguin> yep it's an image
[10:08:03] <johnbender> :D
[10:29:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: we appear to be in good shape save for the version image
[10:29:29] <johnbender> and ...
[10:30:05] <johnbender> well one sec
[10:30:07] <johnbender> let me double check
[10:43:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: http://i.imgur.com/XSPiG.png
[10:43:58] <johnbender> that's not so good
[10:53:47] <gseguin> what happenend there?
[11:02:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: otherwise just let me know when you want me to tag/deploy
[11:47:20] <agcolom> Good evening :-)
[11:48:04] <gseguin> hey Anne
[11:49:05] <agcolom> Ca va ;-)
[11:49:29] <agcolom> I've killed my back today! Stupid bending badly to plug something!
[11:49:46] <agcolom> (to charge my phone!)
[11:50:05] <johnbender> agcolom: :( :(
[11:50:16] <gseguin> :( sorry to hear that agcolom
[11:50:20] <johnbender> if it makes you feel any better I almost killed myself doing back squats this morning
[11:50:29] * johnbender needs a better spotter next time
[11:50:37] <agcolom> I'm in agony if I stand up!!!!
[11:50:45] <johnbender> agcolom: agh
[11:50:48] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! Just checking in briefly: How's the new popup policy? Did I break anything?
[11:51:02] <agcolom> what is back squats?? (I'll check online)
[11:51:06] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Sorry to hear that!
[11:51:12] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[11:51:25] <johnbender> agcolom: take drugs
[11:51:29] <johnbender> it's the only way
[11:51:32] <johnbender> :P
[11:51:38] <agcolom> I have ;-)
[11:51:41] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I didn't see any breakage, johnbender ?
[11:51:43] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Go to a physiotherapist.
[11:51:57] <agcolom> I hope to get more tomorrow....
[11:52:26] <agcolom> Well, I'm still waiting after 4 months to see the physio for my shoulder... that the NHS for you!
[11:53:07] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Thanks! That's awesome! toddmparker_: What about you? Seen any breakage since I implemented the only-one-popup thing?
[11:53:08] <agcolom> Guys, did you see my message about the license text?
[11:54:06] <johnbender> gseguin: _|Nix|_ I haven't been paying attention, I just made sure the deploy would work and I'm continuing to rework bits of my slides
[11:54:54] <agcolom> LICENSE-INFO.txt states: Copyright 2011 (c) jQuery Project
[11:59:14] <agcolom> Should it be Copyright 2011-12 The jQuery Foundation ?? I'm happy to make the change....
[12:01:51] <agcolom> gseguin, is there a MaxScrollForTransition variable?

[12:18:18] <agcolom> Hi Jasper!
[12:18:27] <uGoMobi> johnbender: saw your post on basecamp... can I still pick into 1.1-stable?
[12:18:32] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[12:26:42] <agcolom> btw am i right in thinking there will be no online meeting this week?
[12:29:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: are you still working in 1.1-stable?
[12:30:08] <agcolom> Well, I've not touched anything since yesterday...
[12:30:40] <agcolom> just to be safe...
[12:31:25] <agcolom> just to be safe...i just pull one PR in this morning but on the popup text, so not 1.1-stable
[12:31:54] <uGoMobi> don't see a tag yet, but not 100% sure
[12:32:14] <agcolom> no, the  docs have not been prepared either...
[12:34:07] <uGoMobi> gseguin: are you around?

[12:53:31] <agcolom> toddparker?
[12:53:44] <agcolom> just going to do these changes....
[12:54:06] <agcolom> they go in master only?
[12:54:23] <agcolom> or also 1.1-stable?
[13:01:27] <gseguin> now I am uGoMobi, 'sup?
[13:01:46] <agcolom> gseguin, johnbender I'm changing the templates in the docs to point to 1.1.1-rc.1 but which branch should be updated?
[13:01:59] <agcolom> or branches?
[13:05:24] <gseguin> agcolom: for 1.1.1-rc.1, it's the 1.1-stable branch
[13:05:58] <agcolom> ok, so do I edit 1.1-stable directly (in GitHub for example)
[13:06:13] <gseguin> yep
[13:06:19] <agcolom> cool! Thanks a lot
[13:06:22] <gseguin> let johnbender if you edit stuff
[13:06:36] <gseguin> 'cause he needs to know when you're done for tagging
[13:06:37] <agcolom> know ^?
[13:06:42] <agcolom> ok.
[13:06:49] <gseguin> yeah sorry
[13:07:09] <agcolom> johnbender, I'm going to edit a few things in 1.1-stable
[13:08:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/j7lMYg
[13:08:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] changed to 1.1.1 RC1 - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[13:08:58] <uGoMobi> hi gseguin
[13:09:22] <gseguin> hey uGoMobi
[13:09:38] <uGoMobi> gseguin: sorry, I already figured it out ... was looking for confirmation I could still make changes in 1.1-stable
[13:09:45] <gseguin> ok
[13:09:48] <agcolom> gseguin, Todd says: * Change the CDN links in the single and multi-page templates to point to 1.1.1
[13:10:04] <agcolom> that's 1.1.1-rc-1 right?
[13:10:17] <agcolom> sorry 1.1.1-rc.1
[13:10:17] <gseguin> yes
[13:12:24] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/lrxydQ

[13:13:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] updated to 1.1.1-rc.1 - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[13:13:33] <agcolom> This is so exciting ;-) (sorry, anything to cheer me up ;-) )
[13:20:47] <agcolom> gseguin sorry just one more... about getMaxScrollForTransition... is there a MaxScrollForTransition option?
[13:22:26] <gseguin> nope
[13:22:32] <gseguin> just a function
[13:22:39] <gseguin> that the user can override
[13:23:24] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/xGdHCg
[13:23:24] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] updated to 1.1.1 RC1 - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[13:23:43] <agcolom> ok, so the blurb is wrong then...
[13:24:46] <gseguin> yeah I fixed it in the blog post I think
[13:26:38] <agcolom> Yes I saw you mention it... Now, because that info I put in master and couldn't cherry-pick in 1.1-stable because of conflicting menu (which contains popups and loader widget), once it's correct in master, I can manually add it to 1.1-stable?

[13:35:58] <johnbender> uGoMobi: gseguin: has todd parker popped up?
[13:36:33] <agcolom> he has but disappeared before we could ask anything :-(
[13:36:34] <gseguin> johnbender: just saw a reply on BC from him but haven't seen him on IRC
[13:36:34] <johnbender> agcolom: feel free to pick away
[13:36:42] <_|Nix|_> D000d! data-theme="b" + ui-btn-active = very low contrast ... just check out the tall/grande/vente custom select ...
[13:36:43] <johnbender> I haven't tagged it yet
[13:37:02] <agcolom> where can I find the corrected the blog post?
[13:37:50] <agcolom> (sorry I mean the corrected blog post?)
[13:37:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you could even say... no contrast ;-)
[13:38:19] <gseguin> agcolom: do you have access to wordpress?
[13:38:33] <agcolom> yes, but I couldn't find it there...
[13:38:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: active is a little bit brighter than "b", but the difference is not enough IMO ...
[13:39:06] <gseguin> agcolom: it's there it's in draft status
[13:39:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know... for 1.3 we are going to work on making active state and focus themable
[13:39:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OKOK, that's fine, but in the meantime, can someone please crank up the brightness on active just a tad?
[13:40:01] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you can pick away as well
[13:40:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or, alternatively, turn down the brightness on "b" ...
[13:40:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, "b" === "a", but blue.
[13:40:33] <toddmparker_> hi
[13:40:36] <uGoMobi> johnbender: thanks, I already thought so because I didn't saw a tag
[13:40:40] <toddmparker_> our internet is out, again
[13:40:46] <_|Nix|_> Yaaaay!
[13:40:48] <agcolom> gseguin: euh... maybe I need glasses! ?? I see 4 in draft status...
[13:40:58] <agcolom> but no blog....
[13:41:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: nice timing ;-)
[13:41:12] <agcolom> hey toddparker_
[13:41:26] <gseguin> toddmparker_: the layout of the post is messed up
[13:41:26] <_|Nix|_> Egads - I guess no linting on 1.1-stable ...
[13:41:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: correct
[13:41:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I did not feel like doing that twice
[13:42:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: changing the default theme styling is quite a big change... not sure if that's a good idea
[13:43:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: All I know is that it's hard to see ...
[13:43:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP ... just ran the linter out of habit and Bam! Explooooosion!
[13:44:52] <agcolom> I've updated version.txt from 1.1.1-pre to 1.1.1 RC1 (then I realised it was index.html I needed to change). Is that still ok or should I change version.txt back to 1.1.1-pre?
[13:45:20] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[13:46:53] <toddmparker_> maxlynch:
[13:47:04] <toddmparker_> no progress on icons, love to see what you come up with
[13:47:29] <toddmparker_> no theme editing folks, not unless you want a big change
[13:48:18] <toddmparker_> johnbender and uGoMobi - I'm here
[13:48:22] <toddmparker_> internet permitting
[13:48:48] <toddmparker_> busy weekend all
[13:49:04] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: if you have time to look at popup styling, might be a good time
[13:49:20] <maxlynch> toddmparker_: sure, it's fairly simple, modification to buttonMarkup and some CSS tweaks, I'll come back when I see how workable it is
[13:49:21] <toddmparker_> i touched up the docs but feel free to revise. you too agcolom
[13:49:27] <toddmparker_> cool maxlynch
[13:49:35] <agcolom> toddparker_ in the docs, I've updated index.html, page-anatomy.html, multipage-template.html, page-template.html
[13:49:43] <toddmparker_> gseguin: you're fixing my post? cool.
[13:49:49] <toddmparker_> thanks agcolom
[13:49:54] <toddmparker_> really appreciate it
[13:50:09] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I fixed some typos and stuff
[13:50:20] <gseguin> but right now the layout is messed up
[13:50:32] <toddmparker_> great, thanks. layout is messed up?
[13:50:34] <gseguin> I'll leave that one to you toddmparker_
[13:50:43] <toddmparker_> did you use the wysiwyg editor?
[13:50:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: sorry, not now. I am busy with removing those changes from 1.1
[13:50:56] <agcolom> I also updated version.txt but I think maybe I wasn't supposed to do that one... need instructions whether 1.1.1 RC1 is ok here or it needs to go back to 1.1.1-pre or something else...
[13:51:03] <toddmparker_> sure, not now, now but soon now uGoMobi :)
[13:51:37] <toddmparker_> agcolom: in 1.1-stable, the version should be 1.1.1 RC1 since we're close to a build
[13:51:41] <toddmparker_> we can change it after
[13:52:08] <agcolom> toddparker, ok, that's what I changed it to so we're ok.
[13:52:09] <toddmparker_> agcolom: did you swap out to the CSS version flag
[13:52:11] <agcolom> phew!
[13:52:14] <agcolom> yes
[13:52:15] <toddmparker_> :)
[13:52:24] <toddmparker_> branch preview is stale. going to pull
[13:52:37] <agcolom> ok

[13:55:06] <agcolom> the blog post... of course, I was looking in pages!!!!!

[13:58:13] <toddmparker_> so that's good
[13:58:18] <toddmparker_> diving into the blogpost edit
[13:58:21] <agcolom> strange...
[14:00:59] <agcolom> I've got it... it needs an old master commit to be cherry-picked I think...
[14:01:08] <toddmparker_> ah
[14:01:13] <toddmparker_> to add the styles?
[14:01:20] <agcolom> yes
[14:01:41] <toddmparker_> ah-ha

[14:06:36] <agcolom> but now that I have changed index.html, if I cherry-pick, I'll get a conflict :-(
[14:06:54] <toddmparker_> gseguin: WAT YOU DO TO MY BLOG FORMATS
[14:08:27] <agcolom> so should I change index.html to what it was in this one, then cherry-pick ?

[14:13:27] <agcolom> I am thinking of cherry-picking that old commit...
[14:13:47] <agcolom> otherwise I can make the change by hand if you think that's safer
[14:14:29] <agcolom> only 2 files are affected, so easy to copy/paste the changes.
[14:15:33] <agcolom> Would you prefer if I went for option 2 (manual editing)
[14:15:35] <agcolom> ?
[14:16:52] <agcolom> toddparker_ I hope you haven't lost your internet connection :-( ?

[14:25:05] <agcolom> gseguin, is it ok to incorporate your changes from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/c64c1a4bd22519dec48f687f5cb2fc757c7dfb13#index.html into 1.1-stable by hand (I have already changed index.html as I thought it was all that needed changing)
[14:25:05] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Ghislain Seguin (2m, 1w ago): Use $.mobile.version for version ribbon
[14:25:48] <agcolom> or is it best to get index.html identical to prior your change and then cherry-pick your commit into 1.1-stable?
[14:27:29] <gseguin> agcolom: should be ok to port these changes to 1.1-stable but you also need Wilto's change from before that that creates the ribbon and styles it adequately
[14:27:53] <agcolom> you mean manually?
[14:28:14] <agcolom> gseguin ^?
[14:28:31] <gseguin> you can try cherry picking too
[14:28:44] <gseguin> may have some manual merge work to do

[14:31:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: that's not Wilto's but a fix that came after that one
[14:31:27] <toddmparker_> should just be a few styles in docs/css
[14:31:37] <gseguin> uGoMobi: oh ok
[14:31:46] <gseguin> sorry guys, I have to go to a meeting
[14:32:08] <agcolom> so that's 3 then I need to make sure I incorporate...

[14:56:19] <toddmparker_> been limping on a mifi
[14:56:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_:  good to hear that
[14:57:05] <toddmparker_> been bad
[14:57:12] <toddmparker_> last few weeks really
[14:57:20] <toddmparker_> one reason i haven't been here enough
[14:57:36] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: got most of your changes in, thanks for those
[14:57:40] <uGoMobi> time for new provider?
[14:57:53] <uGoMobi> ok

[14:59:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: so I have time to talk about popup now, but I am not ready with working on it
[14:59:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: or are you busy with getting ready for 1.1.1?
[14:59:40] <uGoMobi> help needed with that?

[15:06:41] <agcolom> toddparker_ I think I'm done. Do you need to manually update the branch?
[15:07:12] <agcolom> btw, I think the licence.txt and the other licence-related files need updating
[15:10:13] <agcolom> ah no, it looks like jqm-docs needs something also...
[15:11:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: what's going on?
[15:11:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: need help?
[15:11:48] <agcolom> where's jqm-docs.css?
[15:11:50] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: i'm here for a few more minutes
[15:12:39] <toddmparker_> agcolom: you find it?
[15:12:44] <agcolom> yes,
[15:13:12] <toddmparker_> docs/_assets
[15:13:13] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!

[15:13:17] <toddmparker_> ok
[15:13:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: Re popup; maybe it's better if I just finish my work on the css and send you the link
[15:14:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I keep changelog so you can read what I have in mind
[15:14:37] <uGoMobi> and then we can discuss that
[15:14:38] <agcolom> but the png is still in master as well, so I'm good I think. But I don't see the update yet in the 1.1-stable branch
[15:16:07] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Do you need to manually update the branch?
[15:19:55] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[15:20:42] <toddmparker_> so agcolom - you see the change locally?
[15:21:11] <toddmparker_> you might just need to copy the styles over that are needed for that. I think it's just a few lines.
[15:22:10] <agcolom> toddmparker_ I did all in github...
[15:22:34] <toddmparker_> the web ui?
[15:22:58] <toddmparker_> i can look at those styles tonight if you need me to
[15:23:14] <toddmparker_> ok, blog post updated
[15:23:25] <toddmparker_> just need to grab the new browser list from master
[15:26:24] <agcolom> jqm-docs.css is looking the same as master except for the ui-popup-container
[15:27:22] <toddmparker_> hmm
[15:27:26] <toddmparker_> lemme look
[15:30:06] <toddmparker_> ah-ha
[15:30:17] <toddmparker_> agcolom: in index.html
[15:30:20] <toddmparker_> <p id="jqm-version"></p>
[15:30:40] <toddmparker_> should be <p class="jqm-version"></p>
[15:33:51] <toddmparker_> agcolom: just pushed a fix.
[15:34:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/ba36ow
[15:34:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Updated the version container from using an ID to a class for the CSS flag - toddparker
[15:35:49] <agcolom> Excellent! I guess that needs a few mins to be seen then?
[15:36:07] <agcolom> Thanks, I completely missed that one!
[15:45:07] <agcolom> toddmparker_ I still see the old <p id="jqm-version"></p> so I'm not getting the change yet...
[15:45:22] <agcolom> going to bed... hope all ok now...
[15:45:49] <agcolom> goodnight everyone....
[15:46:00] <gseguin> good night agcolom
[15:46:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good night Anne
[15:51:15] <toddmparker_> branch previews are slow to update
[15:51:20] <toddmparker_> good night agcolom
[15:51:28] <toddmparker_> heading home, i'll be on tonight
[15:51:37] <toddmparker_> johnbender: i think 1.1.1 is ready to ship
[15:51:47] <toddmparker_> mind running a build so I can test everything out?
[15:52:01] <toddmparker_> talk to you later
[15:52:31] <gseguin> toddmparker_: it looks like some of the changes for the non-image ribbon still need to be ported to 1.1-stable
[16:20:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes I'll deploy now
[16:21:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: what gseguin said
[16:21:30] <johnbender> gseguin: I guess I'll wait until tomorrow :D
[16:21:34] <johnbender> well
[16:21:37] <johnbender>  I can redeploy
[16:21:40] <johnbender> I just won't tag it
[18:17:13] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: are you there?
[18:31:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: when I changed the focus style for buttons I forgot that it would affect text/search input as well
[18:32:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I have a fix ready that set it back to what it was for text/search inputs because that looks better
[18:32:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: can push that to master and (if still possible) pick into 1.1-stable
[18:33:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: just let me know and I will do it first thing tomorrow
[18:33:30] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ^^^
[18:52:35] <DaveMethvin> hey guys, what devices use mobile safari  <4.1?  We have a bug I'd love to close wontfix.
[20:39:12] <kborchers> DaveMethvin looks like everything up to the iPad in this chart if it's accurate. i believe iOS < 4.1 would have mobile safari 531.21.10 or lower based on this http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_version_history
[20:39:26] <kborchers> oops, here is the chart http://www.somegeekintn.com/blog/2012/01/ios-release-mobile-safari-version-table/
[20:39:42] <DaveMethvin> thank you lazyweb, er, kborchers!
[20:39:48] <kborchers> :)
[20:40:15] * DaveMethvin shakes fist at old safari
[23:46:13] <agcolom> johnbender, if you're still around, it looks like the branch 1.1-stable still is not showing the latest changes (after 7h/8h). I wonder whether it needs to be forced to show these updates... I think toddparker_ had to do that last night...
