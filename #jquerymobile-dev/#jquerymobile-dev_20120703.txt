[00:15:49] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ yes, in that case ibuprofen or paracetamol then.... Poor thing!

[05:51:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/8PePNw
[05:51:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Header buttons: Added "button" to the selector. Fixes #4638 - Using button tag in header will show title in new line [1.1.2.] - Jasper de Groot
[08:47:29] <gabejacobs> uGoMobi: Hey are you there?
[08:47:44] <uGoMobi> hi gabejacobs
[08:48:04] <gabejacobs> Hey, just wondering if I could follow up with one thing from yesterday
[08:48:17] <uGoMobi> sure
[08:48:40] <gabejacobs> I remember you talking about binding the changePage function with the preload function (or something like that)?
[08:49:01] <gabejacobs> in order to get the page to change right after the initial page loads
[08:49:11] <gabejacobs> its probably not called the preload function
[08:49:20] <uGoMobi> pageshow event
[08:49:21] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:49:28] <gabejacobs> oh ok
[08:50:07] <gabejacobs> what would that look like?
[08:50:45] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/events.html
[08:51:12] <uGoMobi> just take a look at the examples there
[08:51:54] <uGoMobi> in many cases the pageinit event is the best one to bind to
[08:52:46] <uGoMobi> but I thought in your case "pageshow" event is more appropriate
[08:53:00] <gabejacobs> so maybe something like this? http://pastebin.com/ikuUJJgF
[08:53:12] <gabejacobs> at the beginning of the script
[08:53:52] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:54:07] <uGoMobi> that should work
[08:54:14] <gabejacobs> ok let me try
[08:56:26] <gabejacobs> didn't work
[08:56:52] <uGoMobi> hmm
[08:57:15] <gabejacobs> Probably cause jquery needs some sort of an action to change the page
[08:57:19] <gabejacobs> thats what I learned yesterday
[08:57:23] <uGoMobi> oh wait, pageload should be mobileinit
[08:57:31] <gabejacobs> oh ok
[08:57:34] <uGoMobi> wrong again
[08:57:40] <uGoMobi> pageinit, not mobileinit
[08:57:50] <gabejacobs> haha ok
[08:59:46] <uGoMobi> sorry, doing to many things at the same time here ;)
[09:00:06] <gabejacobs> still doenst work for me
[09:00:10] <gabejacobs> doesn't*
[09:00:32] <uGoMobi> ok, let me try here
[09:00:51] <gabejacobs> ok thanks a lot
[09:04:02] <gabejacobs> I may have figured it out
[09:04:04] <gabejacobs> hold on
[09:04:29] <gabejacobs> yeah I got it
[09:04:49] <gabejacobs> had to do .live
[09:05:01] <gabejacobs> not .bidn
[09:07:26] <uGoMobi> yeah, you are right
[09:08:07] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/otepum/172/
[09:08:47] <uGoMobi> instead of document you should use the id of the page
[09:09:00] <uGoMobi> otherwise it will be triggered on every page
[09:09:04] <gabejacobs> Yep got it. Last question: Is it possible to begin an audio player on a seperate page from a dialog
[09:09:07] <gabejacobs> yeah you are right
[09:09:41] <uGoMobi> also, .live() is deprecated as from jQuery 1.7
[09:09:56] <uGoMobi> you should use .on() now
[09:10:06] <uGoMobi> just so you know
[09:10:56] <uGoMobi> I am not sure if understand your question about the audio player
[09:11:42] <uGoMobi> so you have a dialog and then?
[09:13:08] <gabejacobs> my problem is that
[09:13:26] <gabejacobs> on the iPhone/iPad, autoplay doesnt work
[09:13:52] <gabejacobs> you can't have audio play automatically, which sucks
[09:14:13] <gabejacobs> so I was thinking of pulling up a dialog for them to press "Begin" or something
[09:14:31] <gabejacobs> but then I just realized that that probably wont work haha
[09:14:59] <uGoMobi> aii
[09:15:23] <uGoMobi> I think the new popup widget would be a better solution then
[09:15:54] <gabejacobs> hmm
[09:16:12] <uGoMobi> because a popup is not a page, just a div on a page
[09:16:19] <gabejacobs> thats interesting
[09:17:00] <uGoMobi> but you would have to wait until 1.2 final is out if you want to use stable code for production site
[09:17:08] <gabejacobs> o
[09:17:59] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[09:19:46] <uGoMobi> you were saying you wanted to add a button the the dialog to start the audio player
[09:20:14] <uGoMobi> with what kind of function would you do that?
[09:21:05] <uGoMobi> can you start it with a script? not only with the controls of the audio element?
[09:21:56] <gabejacobs> its possible I can
[09:22:06] <gabejacobs> cause the popup comes up through ajax right?
[09:22:12] <gabejacobs> so the scripts are all still there
[09:22:50] <uGoMobi> popup of dialog?
[09:23:17] <uGoMobi> dialog is loaded through Ajax yes
[09:23:40] <uGoMobi> you can have the markup on the same page as the page with the audio player
[09:24:33] <uGoMobi> but if you want autoplay, why do you want the dialog or popup
[09:25:13] <uGoMobi> if you can start the player with a script then you can call that function on the "pageshow" event
[09:29:49] <gabejacobs> oh yeah!
[09:29:51] <gabejacobs> haha
[09:30:01] <gabejacobs> im an idiot
[09:31:06] <uGoMobi> can you start it with .play() or something? I am not really familiar with html5 audio
[09:31:29] <gabejacobs> it actually still doesnt work with the iPhone/iPad
[09:31:43] <uGoMobi> I see
[09:31:46] <gabejacobs> u need a button of some sort for it to work on the iPhone/iPad
[09:32:50] <uGoMobi> i can imagine that is more user friendly because of the amount of data
[09:33:39] <uGoMobi> if you really want auto play you could try to trigger a click on the button that starts the player
[09:35:06] <gabejacobs> yeah
[09:35:12] <gabejacobs> it actually works through the dialog
[09:35:25] <uGoMobi> cool
[09:35:26] <gabejacobs> but I get the problem where it goes back 2 pages again when you exit it
[09:36:45] <uGoMobi> it would be great if you can put your code in a JSBin and open a new issue on Github so we can look into that
[09:37:19] <uGoMobi> could be a bug in our navigation model
[09:37:27] <gabejacobs> Would it be easier if I just gave you the link to it?
[09:37:57] <gabejacobs> you would have to do view source though, so it may be confusing
[09:38:00] <uGoMobi> sure
[09:38:11] <gabejacobs> it's just that there are a lot of html files
[09:49:40] <agcolom> hey uGoMobi, Quick question...
[09:49:48] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[09:50:02] <agcolom> How are you? and how's your work going?
[09:50:55] <uGoMobi> I am ok. Made progress with work, thanks for asking.
[09:51:04] <uGoMobi> How are you and your back?
[09:51:40] <agcolom> Well I couldn't take any meds today because I had to drive.. so not great!
[09:51:59] <uGoMobi> aii
[09:52:10] <uGoMobi> any idea how it will take to recover?
[09:52:15] <uGoMobi> how long*
[09:52:37] <agcolom> the doctor said it would get worse first and then get better!
[09:52:58] <agcolom> no idea how long... Hoping no more than another week!!! I've had enought!
[09:53:03] <agcolom> enough ^
[09:53:10] <uGoMobi> yeah I can imagine
[09:53:56] <agcolom> here's my question: I need to display a small content (2 checkboxes) in an iframe (for the docs api). Unfortunately I cannot show you the page that contains the iframe (because the dns is not registered?) but I can show you the html code inside the iframe
[09:54:20] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:54:22] <agcolom> my problem is that the content, although tiny, has a scrollbar!
[09:54:33] <agcolom> ACtually I can do a jsbin...
[09:54:39] <agcolom> holdon...
[09:54:57] <uGoMobi> one moment... maybe not needed
[09:55:13] <uGoMobi> had the same with iframe for map popup
[09:55:20] <agcolom> yes!
[09:56:15] <agcolom> the html is: http://users.cscs.wmin.ac.uk/~coloma/JQM/apidocs/checkbox1.html
[09:56:50] <agcolom> actually make the window small and you'll see my problem!
[09:57:31] <agcolom> ha, I think I've got it... I need to make html, body and the page div the size I want?
[09:57:34] <uGoMobi> actually i dont get to see a scrollbar on Chrome
[09:57:39] <uGoMobi> even when very small
[09:57:44] <agcolom> REally???
[09:57:49] <agcolom> I get it in FF
[09:57:59] <agcolom> ok, let me try other browsers
[09:58:54] <agcolom> I get the scrollbars with Safari as well
[09:59:08] <agcolom> and also with Chrome
[09:59:14] <uGoMobi> html, body { padding: 0; margin: 0; }
[09:59:32] <uGoMobi> I added that to the html page that gets loaded in the iframe
[09:59:42] <agcolom> Do you have the jsbin you used for the map iframe?
[10:00:39] <uGoMobi> that example you posted doesnt have an iframe in it
[10:00:54] <agcolom> no, it's the content of the iframe
[10:01:01] <uGoMobi> aha
[10:01:05] <agcolom> (the html file that goes inside it)
[10:01:16] <uGoMobi> i see
[10:01:38] <uGoMobi> that explains why I dont see the scrollbars
[10:02:01] <uGoMobi> no i dont have a jsbin of that popup example
[10:02:07] <uGoMobi> but you can see it on github
[10:02:20] <uGoMobi> i added a file map.html to the docs
[10:02:39] <uGoMobi> that is the one that gets loaded in the iframe
[10:03:09] <agcolom> ok
[10:03:17] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/docs/pages/popup/map.html
[10:03:24] <uGoMobi> there you go
[10:04:11] <uGoMobi> you might have to set "border: none" as well
[10:04:30] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/ewuvuv/2/
[10:04:51] <agcolom> I just made a dead simple one
[10:05:36] <agcolom> also, you see how the color stops where the content stops, but the page is much longer
[10:06:13] <uGoMobi> so the iframe should fill the whole page, right?
[10:06:49] <agcolom> no, the iframe should be small
[10:07:19] <agcolom> the content of the iframe should be small as well
[10:07:46] <agcolom> the height of the iframe is 120px
[10:08:23] <agcolom> (I can change that, it's just that I'd like it as small as possible, but I do not want scroll bars...
[10:09:38] <agcolom> so I think I need to add some css to specify that the page div is 120px and same for content div?
[10:09:40] <uGoMobi> you have to set the height on the iframe as well as the page that goes inside the iframe
[10:10:01] <agcolom> yes, I think that's what I'm missing
[10:12:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: point is that JQM sets a min-height on the page
[10:13:02] <uGoMobi> you need to override this with max-height: 120px;
[10:13:29] <agcolom> ok, I was doing just height!!!!
[10:14:44] <uGoMobi> that might not work because of that min-height
[10:17:27] <agcolom> I'm trying to override min as well in the element...
[10:20:14] <toddmparker_> gseguin or johnbender - you around?
[10:20:26] <toddmparker_> wondering how we set up the /test/ live preview of master
[10:20:34] <toddmparker_> want to rig that up at filament
[10:21:17] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker_ how is CA?
[10:27:24] <toddmparker_> CA is good. Went to legoland yesterday
[10:27:45] <uGoMobi> cool :)
[10:28:06] <uGoMobi> I was such a fan of lego (actually I still am ;-) )
[10:29:00] <agcolom> Don't tell my son! He spends all his time with legos! He makes amazing things: Candy machines (that take real money and give you real sweets!
[10:29:23] <agcolom> and he made a pinball machine as well the other day...
[10:29:38] <agcolom> He makes safes also with locking systems
[10:29:49] <agcolom> (he likes money obviously!)
[10:30:09] <agcolom> All just from lego pieces and no model!
[10:30:10] <gseguin> now I am, 'sup?
[10:30:43] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ^
[10:31:13] <gseguin> btw I'll be off tomorrow and the rest of the week
[10:31:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ gseguin johnbender: can one of you take a quick look at my PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4640 Just want a second pair of eyes on it before committing
[10:31:26] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by uGoMobi (1h, 52m ago): Fixes #4636 and #4637 - Class ui-disabled was not added during enhancement of disabled textinputs
[10:31:29] <toddmparker_> wow, impressive agcolom
[10:31:37] <uGoMobi> hey gseguin
[10:31:42] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[10:32:00] <toddmparker_> do you know how we auto-update /test/
[10:32:00] <gseguin> hiya
[10:32:19] <toddmparker_> some sort of post-commit hook?
[10:32:24] <gseguin> we have a webhook on github
[10:32:45] <gseguin> let me figure out
[10:34:12] <gseguin> toddmparker_: do you have access to jquerymobile.com ?
[10:34:32] <gseguin> it's a php script: gitpostcommit.php
[10:36:33] <toddmparker_> ah, cool
[10:38:27] <toddmparker_> i think that repo was replaced by the new site
[10:38:30] <toddmparker_> looking...
[10:39:18] <toddmparker_> maybe it was moved to the johnbender repo
[10:39:42] <gseguin> where is johnbender?
[10:40:52] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I'm not a hundred percent sure though 'cause I don't have access to the list of webhooks on our repo
[10:47:02] <toddmparker_> found it!
[10:47:04] <toddmparker_> thanks
[10:47:28] <gseguin> you're welcome
[10:47:39] <gseguin> uGoMobi: looking at your PR
[10:47:53] <uGoMobi> gseguin: thanks!
[10:48:29] <uGoMobi> I just see that we forgot to pick a fix into 1.1-stable :(
[10:49:04] <gseguin> that's ok, we can put it in, it'll be in final
[10:49:51] <uGoMobi> I thought we didn't make changes anymore unless there is a critical bug in RC1
[10:52:45] <gseguin> uGoMobi: how risky is that fix?
[10:53:05] <gseguin> uGoMobi:  I commented on your PR
[10:53:28] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah I saw your comments, thanks again
[10:54:04] <uGoMobi> I will remove the commit for the aria-disabled attribute
[10:54:56] <uGoMobi> and take care of that if statement... totally agree about that
[10:55:51] <uGoMobi> about that fix... not that risky if you ask me https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4363
[10:55:52] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by uGoMobi (1m, 2w ago): Fixes #3998 - All buttons, regardless of markup, should be mini by default in toolbars
[10:56:26] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ^
[10:56:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: What do you think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2865#issuecomment-6727496 ? Have I misunderstood your initial comment?
[10:56:29] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2865 on jquery-mobile (toddparker; 8m, 6d ago): Page title overridden on first load
[11:02:14] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: I need to review this in more detail, but master seems to be working as I'd expect now
[11:03:02] <toddmparker_> it used to incorrectly miss the title tag when you'd refresh and fall back to using the H1 text, even when the title was populated
[11:03:21] <toddmparker_> i agree with the specificity you describe to
[11:05:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: That's just it though - the document title should be the fallback IMO, not the page title. The page title should be the primary source, because it most closely describes the page the user is looking at.
[11:06:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Of course, if designed correctly, the document title will be something generic, like the name of the application.
[11:06:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: In that case, it's not much of an issue, but still, a given page will have one title if accessed one way, and another title if accessed another way.
[11:07:26] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: In case of the jqm docs, if this fix stands, we should probably change all pages to say <title>jQuery Mobile: Demos and Documentation</title> ...
[11:24:10] <agcolom> ok, whatever is decided, please let me know :-) (maybe via basecamp)
