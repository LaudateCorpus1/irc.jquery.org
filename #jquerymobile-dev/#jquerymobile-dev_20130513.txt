[05:43:46] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi: _|Nix|_:
[05:43:57] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:45:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: man people realy pick over our commits https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/3f1e1c567cf7a07be40126cebfb51fbcfd213fd2#commitcomment-3194596
[05:46:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yup, always thousands of people watching over your shoulder ;)
[05:46:25] <arschmitz> that was never even actually in 
[05:46:32] <arschmitz> it was only ever local 
[05:47:28] <uGoMobi> as long as you commit it and didn't do hard reset it will be on master
[05:47:48] <uGoMobi> you mean the fix come together with te typo?
[05:48:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i know i just meant it the fixing commit was done before anything was ever pushed
[05:48:07] <uGoMobi> I guess people just go over all commits
[05:48:12] <uGoMobi> right
[05:48:42] <uGoMobi> and obviously people like to comment first and then check if it might be fixed already
[05:49:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: whats your thoughts on this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2328#issuecomment-17809152 it would fix firefox for android but break ie and opera
[05:50:22] <arschmitz> so we would have to add a fall back for ie and opera to still use pageX/pageY
[05:50:49] <arschmitz> so it would complicate the code
[05:51:08] <arschmitz> and only fixes firefox for android
[05:52:14] <uGoMobi> hmm
[05:53:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: firefox just does the same thing as iOS currently
[05:55:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry, IRC problems
[05:55:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem
[05:56:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can't we include that FF for Android fix in the iOS fix extension
[05:56:45] <uGoMobi> ?
[06:01:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the ios extension does fix firefox
[06:01:36] <arschmitz> already
[06:01:59] <uGoMobi> ah ok, sorry
[06:02:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they want us to make a change to the library to use screen instead of page to fix firefox
[06:02:49] <uGoMobi> yes, I saw that. I just don't know how you fixed iOS in that extension
[06:03:10] <arschmitz> oh it uses scroll top
[06:03:15] <uGoMobi> checking scroll pos
[06:03:17] <uGoMobi> right
[06:03:28] <arschmitz> the advantage of this over the ios fix is it does not have the performance impact
[06:03:49] <uGoMobi> ok I understand
[06:05:23] <uGoMobi> how would we do the fallback? UA sniffing?
[06:05:34] <uGoMobi> window.opera?
[06:06:04] <arschmitz> yeah check window.opera and $.support.oldIE
[06:07:28] <uGoMobi> shouldn't add that much code I suppose
[06:08:17] <arschmitz> yeah has to be added in two places though would have to be in both start and stop objects
[06:09:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the other option is to make another extension for firefox
[06:10:56] <arschmitz> or add it into the ios one so it avoids the performance impact of the ios one
[06:10:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think I am fine with fixing it in the library
[06:12:10] <uGoMobi> difficult to decide what should go into the framework and what should be an extension though
[06:13:07] <uGoMobi> so many people that just load the whole library, no custom build
[06:13:22] <arschmitz> yeah firefox mobile has such low share and because it only fixes that one case while still leaving others broken and adding complications to maintain support on others it makes me leary
[06:14:02] <uGoMobi> I understand
[06:14:19] <arschmitz> now if it fixed ios no questions lol
[06:14:27] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:18:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe we should re-open or create new ticket for FF/Android issue and give it low priority label
[06:19:12] <arschmitz> yeah give us some time to think about the best way lol
[06:19:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[06:19:23] <uGoMobi> after 1.4 or something
[06:19:28] <arschmitz> yea
[06:24:45] <_|Nix|_> Hey, guys! I'm back from a trip into crazy string-parsing land.
[06:25:04] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ welcome back
[06:25:11] <_|Nix|_> I tried to devise a hair-brained scheme for fixing the script load order problem in IE.
[06:25:22] <uGoMobi> string-parsing land? is it sunny there?
[06:25:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wish.
[06:26:09] <_|Nix|_> Like, parse the iframe your about to write out, yank all the script tags, and introduce a script tag which writes them back one at a time in an idle loop.
[06:27:21] <uGoMobi> why not just load google.com/chrome/download in the iframe? ;)
[06:29:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Indeed ... I don't believe any dev in their right mind will run IE for work.
[06:29:57] <_|Nix|_> InsanityÂ²
[06:33:51] <uGoMobi> I noticed that IE9 on Win7 was automatically updated to IE10
[06:34:20] <uGoMobi> auto update is already something
[06:34:35] <uGoMobi> now wait until XP is gone
[06:34:57] <uGoMobi> and IE6-8 with it
[06:35:24] <_|Nix|_> ... and M$ will have finally granted us the world we would have had 5 years ago ...
[06:35:32] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:37:36] <uGoMobi> just checked... April 8 2014
[06:42:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool! You made listview page-independent?
[06:42:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup
[06:43:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... so, are we doing the review and merging into "next" as we go along?
[06:43:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i wasent but we could
[06:43:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i did that as part of removing nested listview
[06:43:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's cool.
[06:43:52] <arschmitz> and uGoMobi merged because hes working on the listview css
[06:43:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right.
[06:44:26] <_|Nix|_> I say we tread carefully, but along those lines. What say you, arschmitz and uGoMobi?
[06:44:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi said hes going to try and finish up next this week and merge back in
[06:44:47] <arschmitz> then we can go to town on widgets
[06:44:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *nod* ... great! Sounds good!
[06:45:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This listview-doesn't-need-page thing is huge for popups. Cross-page popup menus done with a listview inside a popup is an item in huge demand.
[06:46:10] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:46:16] <arschmitz> im working on panel next
[06:46:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... panel is fairly deeply tied into the page. It wraps the contents and everything ...
[06:47:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Awesome!
[06:47:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we can do the custom select menu list without the listview widget
[06:47:14] <arschmitz> ahh but its not as bad as it sounds
[06:47:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Really? We just add the selectors?
[06:47:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: for panels if they are outside the page its easy because the page is already essentially wrapped
[06:47:56] <arschmitz> so just skip the wrapping and act on .ui-page-active
[06:48:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and we'll have a listview-y looking thing that's not really a widget?
[06:48:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, just add .ui-btn to the anchor in the LI
[06:48:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: was not able to remove the dependants functions from core :( they are needed for dialog custom selects 
[06:48:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, but wasn't the panel introducing a div between .ui-page and the header/content/footer?
[06:49:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah but we just skip that if its not in a page
[06:49:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hut diggety! Man, you guys are smokin'!
[06:49:18] <arschmitz> because it was just wrapping the page into a single div for animation
[06:49:19] <uGoMobi_> grrr I keep getting disconnected from IRC
[06:49:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so now we can just act on the actual page no need for wrapping
[06:49:42] <uGoMobi_> not sure if you got my last lines
[06:50:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The last thing I read from you was "yes, just add .ui-btn to the anchor in the LI"
[06:50:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What about option groups and such?
[06:50:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and multiple select?
[06:50:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i really think we will be able to make "Most" widget page independant for 1.4 
[06:52:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's really great! We shouldn't forget to remove the AMD dependency on page in those cases, because it can really inflate custom builds, and it's no use without init anyway.
[06:52:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's something to check
[06:52:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I guess "no use" is too strong. You can still call .page(), but, like, if you don't need to, why would you? :)
[06:53:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: :( well its currently missing actually
[06:54:34] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5996
[06:56:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's a big fat bug that'll go away :)
[06:56:42] <arschmitz> yup
[06:57:26] <arschmitz> oh _|Nix|_ i have a question for you about a test on dialogs
[06:58:33] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/integration/dialog/index.html#L97
[06:59:29] <arschmitz> the last two dialogs here are identical execpt for the overlay theme
[07:00:50] <arschmitz> execpt https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/integration/dialog/index.html#L97 and line #187 expect them to have different content themes
[07:02:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oops second link should have been https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/integration/dialog/dialog_events.js#L159

[11:07:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you around?
[11:10:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you still here?
[11:23:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ arschmitz : I am working on theme inheritance... My idea was to make theme default to null in widgets and do inheritance with CSS. That works fine as long as there is a JQM page with a ui-body-x class but I now realize that if you use a widget but not a JQM page there will be no style at all if you don't set it.
[11:24:00] <uGoMobi> Would be a pity if we have to use getInheritedTheme() just for this reason
[12:01:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[12:01:17] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[12:01:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just read what you wrote.
[12:01:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[12:01:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If there's no ui-body-x above the widget, using getInheritedTheme() will not work either.
[12:02:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We'll just have to document that the user has to apply /some/ class at /some/ level for there to be a theme.
[12:02:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true... I meant getInheritedTheme() || "a"
[12:03:00] <uGoMobi> so there would be a theme if there is no page
[12:03:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but that's hardcoding.
[12:03:55] <uGoMobi> yeah
[12:04:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, basically: Either you set data-theme="x" on a widget, or you create it with { theme: "x" }, or you add ui-body-x to some parent.
[12:04:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's a lot of options.
[12:04:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true
[12:04:52] <uGoMobi> sounds as a good solution to me
[12:06:09] <uGoMobi> just wasn't sure if it was acceptable
[12:06:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... if you can swing theme inheritance via CSS, the guy who devises a reason for keeping getInheritedTheme() around should get a Turing award.
[12:06:21] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:06:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_ hi
[12:06:42] <arschmitz> catching up
[12:06:44] <uGoMobi> hi arschmitz 
[12:06:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: getIneritedTheme() die! die! diE!
[12:07:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... in a nutshell.
[12:07:09] <asheppard> uGoMobi: fwiw, dojo/dijit has users set a class on <body> to control widget theming
[12:07:27] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, so not unheard of.
[12:07:37] <uGoMobi> asheppard: ah, thanks for the info
[12:08:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also from what iv seen most people that want to use them outside a page do not want our themeing either
[12:08:52] <arschmitz> execptions for toolbar/panel/popup
[12:08:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No idea about those dialog tests. Probably something to test themeing.
[12:09:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good point
[12:09:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: _|Nix|_ yeah it is i just dont understand how they would get different themes
[12:09:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think it should be css / option if its not set in css and you want it set use data-theme=
[12:10:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I've just been kinda glossing over them so far.
[12:10:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the reason im trying to figure it out is im trying to get all tests passing for toolbar widget / removing page.sections
[12:10:58] <arschmitz> and the second of those tests isnt passing
[12:11:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird ...
[12:11:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Got a branch?
[12:11:22] <arschmitz> yeah its not up to date though hold on ill commit and push
[12:11:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[12:11:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: other problem im getting is tests that fail command line but pass fine in browser
[12:12:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That might be load order differences.
[12:14:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah ill have to look at that
[12:14:16] <arschmitz> ok i just push to branch page-sections
[12:14:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool!
[12:15:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not done with all the tests yet but the dialog ones are driving me nuts

[12:19:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: NM. I'm an idiot.
[12:20:00] <arschmitz> lol ok
[12:20:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! /all/ my dialog integration tests are failing.
[12:20:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ...  in phantomjs.
[12:20:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah browser only one is failing
[12:21:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Dang! Could be a syntax error.
[12:21:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... although I believe jshint runs as part of grunt test, so that's unlikely.
[12:21:53] <arschmitz> it does
[12:22:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'm on it.
[12:25:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok so i just noticed something im not sure has not previously been an issue
[12:26:35] <arschmitz> the page widget has never previously been listen in jquery.mobile.js
[12:27:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Which jquery.mobile.js? dist/jquery.mobile.js or js/jquery.mobile.js?
[12:27:49] <arschmitz> js/jquery.mobile.js
[12:28:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird, because I'm sure /something/ pulls it in.
[12:28:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... so it's definitely gonna end up in the build.
[12:28:31] <arschmitz> yeah im not sure
[12:28:40] <arschmitz> it must get there for stuff to work
[12:28:46] <arschmitz> but its not listed in that file
[12:29:39] <arschmitz> but as far as i can see its never been listed there
[12:32:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i take that back gseguin removed it here

[12:59:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... there's something deeply wrong with the dialogs ... I mean, the widget factory is getting some really funky input ...
[12:59:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm looking into turning on Web Inspector for phantomjs ...
[12:59:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: have you tried it in the browser?
[12:59:46] <arschmitz> everythign execpt one test passes
[12:59:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. Indeed, only one failure.
[13:00:03] <arschmitz> and thats that test that i dont even understand WHY it would pass lol
[13:00:12] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:00:44] <arschmitz> the fixedToolbar tests are timing out in command line and all gree browser
[13:01:01] <arschmitz> its annoying lol
[13:01:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait ... bisect ...
[13:01:17] <arschmitz> ??
[13:01:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... although that may not be indicative, because I'm sure there are lots of commits that break unit tests.
[13:01:41] <arschmitz> yup
[13:01:47] <arschmitz> like every one on this branch
[13:01:54] <arschmitz> page.sections was everywhere
[13:01:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... OTOH, if we concentrate on the widget factory breakage, we might find the commit that breaks everything.
[13:02:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, IDC about any failures, but I will consider commits where the widget factory fails to be bad.
[13:02:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That might restore sanity.
[13:02:57] <arschmitz> what do you mean the widget factory breaks ???
[13:03:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: TypeError: '[object Object]' is not a valid argument for 'Function.prototype.apply' (evaluating 'base.prototype[ prop ].apply')
[13:03:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's in the widget factory.
[13:04:50] <arschmitz> ah ok 
[13:04:58] <arschmitz> hmmm weird its only command line though
[13:05:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Might even have to do the bisect by hand because you've merged in master a bunch of times - which is good, but it might confuse the bisect.
[13:05:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: one widget thing though is before this dialog did not depend on page widget
[13:05:49] <arschmitz> now it does
[13:05:55] <arschmitz> that could be weird
[13:06:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Could be ...
[13:07:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I bet that's it ... it's calling _super()!
[13:07:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and the superclass has no implementation of the function.
[13:08:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've had that happen, and the widget factory does not protect against that.
[13:08:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... then again, it could be something else.
[13:08:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it does not inherit from page it just depends on it existing
[13:09:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[13:09:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, AMD-depends.
[13:09:30] <arschmitz> yup
[13:09:41] <arschmitz> toolbar also 
[13:10:09] <arschmitz> but again just amd
[13:11:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: According to my reading of the git tree, page-sections has only one proper commit: It branches off Nested Listviews: Remove nested listviews depreceated in 1.3.0
[13:11:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: , then there's a merge of master, then there's Toolbar Tests: updating tests to toolbar from page.sections
[13:11:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and that's it.
[13:11:35] <arschmitz> there should be a bunch before that
[13:11:40] <arschmitz> about toolbars
[13:12:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, right ... I misread.
[13:12:06] <arschmitz> ok lol
[13:12:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I hate that there's no good git visualization tool ...
[13:12:32] <arschmitz> yeah iv never seen a good one that works with the branches well
[13:13:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I could really use somthing like this: http://oandrieu.nerim.net/monotone-viz/Screenshot-Monotone-viz.png
[13:14:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Uses graphviz ... really nice!
[13:14:07] <arschmitz> thats cool
[13:14:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I used it a while back - unfortunately, it's written in ocaml, so I'm not gonna port it to git anytime soon.
[13:14:59] <hcker2000> i had a quick question about panels if any one would indulge me
[13:15:30] <_|Nix|_> hcker2000: Please ask your question in #jquery
[13:16:13] <hcker2000> _|Nix|_, thanks I'm in there as well try to get some help on it
[13:16:55] <hcker2000> the only thing im trying to do is hook into the href tap event that opens the panel and conidionally close or open the panel
[13:17:03] <hcker2000> but there is no mention of this in the documentation
[13:17:20] <hcker2000> and event.preventDefault() dosnt seem to work
[13:19:36] <uGoMobi> hcker2000: I justed replied in #jquery
[13:20:04] <hcker2000> thanks
[13:29:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, so the in-between commits are not testable, because the dependencies cause requirejs to barf.
[13:29:44] <arschmitz> yup lol lots of messed up deps 
[13:31:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *sigh* ... back to console.log ... 
[13:31:31] <arschmitz> yeah its really a HUGE change when it comes to the tests
[13:32:09] <arschmitz> sadly there was no real way to do it a step at a time either
[13:34:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Gah ... I wish there was a way to tell it to run only the first test ...
[13:42:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[13:43:02] <arschmitz> these test are driving me mad
[13:49:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! I've been able to turn on debugging in phantomjs but it's useless. It's an ancient version of Web inspector, and I can't figure out how to get the script to run ...
[13:50:15] <arschmitz> thats useful lol
[13:52:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... maybe tomorrow, refreshed ...
[13:53:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah no problem im going to keep plugging away for a while
[14:08:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmmm so i got toolbars to night timeout command line but not im getting same failures as dialog same error
[14:13:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im on its trail
[14:13:49] <arschmitz> its something im doing in _create
[14:14:34] <arschmitz> if i just comment out _create the widget factory error is gone
[14:14:43] <arschmitz> so that narrows it right down
[14:15:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its $.mobile._enhancer.enhance( this.element[ 0 ] );
[14:24:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: do you know why dialog is still binding to pagecreate and not using the registry?
[14:50:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: if i change$.mobile.selectmenu.initSelector = "select:not( :jqmData(role='slider') )";
[14:50:21] <arschmitz> //auto self-init widgets
[14:50:39] <arschmitz> oops change line https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.registry.js#L61
[14:51:05] <arschmitz> to send an empty array for dependencies it removes the widget factory error
[15:30:51] <jabb> anyone have an answer for mah problem? :P
