[07:48:47] <gseguin> 'morning folks
[07:53:02] <Wilto> Yo.
[07:53:56] <johnbender> heyo
[07:54:52] <Wilto> Don’t ever join a standards body’s mailing list, gentlemen. Just trust me on this one.
[09:05:46] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: scottjehl: is there any reason we try to focus the page on animation complete instead of just doing it a tiny bit later in the promise resolution
[09:06:22] <Wilto> None spring to mind, but that’s Scott’s territory way more than mine.
[09:08:04] <johnbender> hmm
[09:08:27] <johnbender> there's a comment there but it's hard to understand
[09:08:38] <Wilto> Where at?
[09:11:47] <johnbender> Wilto: it's mine, I think what happened here is that the focus page got moved back after I fixed this bug already
[09:12:55] <Wilto> Ah, gotcha.
[09:19:22] <johnbender> Wilto: yap I think that's what happened
[09:19:28] <Wilto> DAMMIT, SCOTT
[09:20:39] <Wilto> Did we end up with Android Chrome installed somewhere? gseguin?

[09:59:45] <johnbender> I ended up just re-fixing that issue
[09:59:53] <johnbender> and crediting sergey
[10:00:00] <johnbender> I had actually already fixed it
[10:00:05] <johnbender> it just got unfixed :(
[10:00:14] <Wilto> Dude’s still off eating scones with Prince William.
[10:00:38] <Wilto> Or however the UK works.
[10:00:54] <Wilto> I don’t leave Boston much.
[10:01:23] <Wilto> I wish—just once—one of our three (3) Playbooks would work correctly when I attempt to do anything ever.

[17:31:52] <toddmparker_> johnbender - do you now have a way to tell the framework to enhance, say, a link to a button but not apply the AJAX stuff? In general, I wonder if we could at least support linking to #anchors within a page if we could apply an attr to the link or a parent
[17:32:41] <toddmparker_> mega time shift...it's 1:30am here in Oxford
[17:33:24] <toddmparker_> on the down low, not done yet

[19:05:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm hopeful we aren't targeting that at 1.1 :D
[19:05:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: as for the nav thing we don't have a per link disable
[19:05:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: although we do check if the page is embedded
