[05:46:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: we have a LOT of test failures in iOS in the events tests 
[05:47:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: only iOS5 though 6 is fine
[06:17:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Something not defined, maybe?
[06:17:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: most of them are nothing
[06:18:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in those tests if you touch the screen onces the tests are complete it will trigger 50 global errors lol
[06:18:27] <arschmitz> even after all tests are done and green
[06:19:06] <arschmitz> however on iOS5 only "move handler returns when touchstart has been fired since touchstop" fails so need to look into that
[06:23:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: D00d ... converting select.custom.js to native is /non-trivial/ - to say the least.
[06:23:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've made modest gains with controlgroup as well ...
[06:23:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe I should do slider before select ...
[06:23:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: select is huuuuuge!
[06:24:08] <arschmitz> yeah select is really big a lot going on there
[06:26:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uh oh im getting like 24 failures on nav unit tests
[06:26:47] <arschmitz> on master
[06:30:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... on iOS 5?
[06:30:38] <arschmitz> no chrome 24 windows 7
[06:30:45] <_|Nix|_> Dang ...
[06:31:06] * _|Nix|_ switches contexts
[06:32:08] <arschmitz> popup has a failure too but im guessing ites related to nav
[06:32:20] <arschmitz> there is also a failure in select menus
[06:34:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: on the bright side i ran the full test suit on jquery core 1.9 and the only failures were the same on 1.8.3 so i think 1.9 is essentially all green ha ha 
[06:35:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no need to add https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5450 to feature request wiki
[06:35:28] <uGoMobi> will never make it if you ask me
[06:36:22] <arschmitz> you dont think so? i thought it made sense its pretty standard if mixing numbers and letters and ordering that all numbers come first then other stuff in alpha order?
[06:37:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, number come first, but they are not grouped
[06:37:40] <uGoMobi> if you want to group them we already have the option autodividersSelector
[06:38:01] <arschmitz> oh i see what your saying i think i miss understood i thought it wasent doing that and thats what he wanted
[06:38:04] <uGoMobi> see JS Bin that I added in a comment on the issue
[06:38:26] <uGoMobi> Nah, it's just about grouping them like "0-9"
[06:38:39] <arschmitz> ok yeah ill take it off the wiki then 
[06:38:51] <uGoMobi> BTW - autodivers don't auto-sort
[06:39:57] <arschmitz> yeah i didnt really think about that one just read the description real quick and was like oh that makes sense close and add to wiki
[06:42:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i finished testing against core 1.9 and im saying its "greenish" lol
[06:43:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: in that it only fails the same tests that 1.8.3 does
[06:46:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: I think that should count for something ha ha ha
[06:53:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nav works for me on Chrome 24/ Linux
[06:53:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: At least index.html ... come to think of it, I should run it in phantomjs ...
[06:54:36] * _|Nix|_ retests with phantomjs ...
[06:54:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: odd thats what i tested and had major failures
[06:55:11] <arschmitz> well execpt windows
[06:57:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: checking osx now
[06:59:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i get 9 failures on osx chrome 24

[07:03:49] <toddmparker> hey all
[07:04:22] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[07:04:32] <toddmparker> morning
[07:04:44] <arschmitz> hey toddmparker
[07:05:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: phantomjs is clean.
[07:05:13] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi and arschmitz 
[07:05:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll try Chrome on Win 7 myself ...
[07:05:24] <toddmparker> nice job on triage/pr's
[07:06:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5460 is not a bug, but... which one of the two code samples is faster?
[07:06:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah its failing in chrome 24 on osx and win7 though so something is up
[07:06:39] <arschmitz> lol already closed uGoMobi: but they are essentially the same from all the testing iv done it makes no real difference
[07:07:28] <arschmitz> toddmparker: have to be on top of it a lot flooding in lol
[07:07:43] <uGoMobi> ah ok, I can delete my comment then ;)
[07:08:04] <uGoMobi> good to know there is no difference
[07:08:08] <uGoMobi> thanks
[07:08:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker: we did end up being broken on core 1.9 lol so much for git build ha ha 
[07:09:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: any thoughts on chrome failures? 
[07:11:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Chrome 24/Win 7 is green for me ...
[07:12:00] <arschmitz> weird i tried many times 
[07:12:05] <arschmitz> tried osx also
[07:12:14] <arschmitz> and both are showing same failures
[07:12:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When the tests run, do you do anything else with the computer running them>
[07:12:23] <_|Nix|_> ?
[07:12:25] <arschmitz> nope
[07:12:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Just to double-check: I'm testing this commitid: c2921cadfb4ff0311b9982b3e451de91cd170304
[07:13:20] <arschmitz> im just on a new clone of master so let me double check thats the latest commit lol
[07:13:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: intresting different tests are failing on win7 / osx
[07:14:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do you have some Chrome extensions that could be influencing things?
[07:15:11] <arschmitz> ill try disabling any i have to be sure
[07:15:16] <arschmitz> but i dont think so
[07:15:17] <toddmparker> that is odd. guess we need to look at why we didn't catch that
[07:15:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker: if your talking about 1.9 the change was right right before they released
[07:16:12] <arschmitz> it caught the failure when it ran against git this morning
[07:16:21] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: this would be a good demo - http://jsbin.com/ehowik/16/edit
[07:16:56] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i talked to DaveMethvin and the core guys last night and already have the fix commited though 
[07:18:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok, I will copy it to a demo page
[07:18:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm i think it might have been an extension i disabled all and osx seems good now
[07:18:34] <arschmitz> checking win7
[07:24:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: lied spoke too soon it fails different tests now still failing in osx and win7
[07:25:43] <arschmitz> completely different tests in the two os's though
[07:30:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm still green ... *shrug* ... I can try Safari on Win 7 ...
[07:31:50] <arschmitz> im trying safari now 
[07:32:02] <arschmitz> nope failures there too!
[07:32:11] <arschmitz> ugh i dont get it 
[07:32:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are we testing the same commitid?
[07:32:27] <arschmitz> yes
[07:32:43] <arschmitz> the one you listed is latest on master im testing the same
[07:33:00] <arschmitz> i even tried cloning again in a new directory to be sure 
[07:33:23] <arschmitz> the tests that fail are not consistant though either its very odd
[07:34:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toddmparker: do either of you have a minute to test something
[07:34:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You're gonna love it. They're green on Safari/Win 7 too :)
[07:35:01] <arschmitz> i didnt try safari win 7 only safari osx but im sure it would be the same :(
[07:35:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[07:35:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I don't have OSX anywhere ... sorry ...

[07:39:10] * _|Nix|_ is grasping at straws ...
[07:39:10] <arschmitz> tried local and on server
[07:39:23] <arschmitz> and on different computers too of course lol
[07:39:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK. I only have one server - my Linux laptop.
[07:39:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't have a server installed on Win 7 ....

[08:10:25] <_|Nix|_> Amen!
[08:10:26] <arschmitz> gseguin
[08:10:33] <arschmitz> no im getting in on OSX
[08:10:55] <gseguin> ho, misread
[08:11:09] <gseguin> so there must be something wrong then
[08:11:17] <gseguin> 'cause it can't be osx
[08:11:21] <arschmitz> gseguin: im getting tons of nav test failures on OSX and on one windows 7 pc
[08:11:33] <arschmitz> but another windows 7 pc is fine
[08:11:48] <gseguin> what does our CI say?
[08:11:50] <arschmitz> and _|Nix|_ cant get any failures and neither can uGoMobi
[08:12:13] <arschmitz> all of them are new clones of master
[08:12:52] <arschmitz> on osx i even did a new clean instal of MAMP with nothing but a clone of jqm in root
[08:12:56] <arschmitz> and still get them
[08:13:04] <arschmitz> but uGoMobi: gets all green
[08:13:11] <arschmitz> gseguin: im crazy confused lol
[08:14:11] <arschmitz> gseguin: get them in both chrome and safari
[08:14:35] <gseguin> hmm
[08:14:54] <gseguin> just nav tests?
[08:14:58] <arschmitz> but the number of tests that fail is different in each browser / os combo its nuts
[08:15:09] * gseguin tries it out
[08:15:16] <arschmitz> a few other isolated ones that all seem nav related though like in popup and custom select
[08:31:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe I should do a clean clone of master.
[08:32:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe I have something in my working dir that makes it work ...
[08:32:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont know iv done all clean clones
[08:32:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Not I.
[08:32:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but i had one work
[08:32:38] <arschmitz> in chrome on my win7 laptop
[08:32:48] <arschmitz> but other ones on same laptop dont its so weird
[08:32:49] <gseguin> arschmitz: green on Chrome 24/OSX
[08:33:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe it was that typo I fixed ;)
[08:34:14] <arschmitz> gesguin: im ready to give up i dont get it clean new laptop clean new mamp instal with new clone and nothing else does not workin chrome 24OSX
[08:34:19] <arschmitz> but it seems like only for me
[08:44:57] <CIDIC> anyone around
[08:44:58] <CIDIC> ?
[08:45:18] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: No.

[08:46:06] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: is there a way to change a fixed footer nav bar dynamically after loading?
[08:46:27] <CIDIC> I tried removing and replacing and it almost works, it won't set the current state of any of the buttons
[08:52:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: phantomjs/Linux on a clean checkout is green.
[08:53:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ i have no doubt lol
[08:53:44] <arschmitz> its clearly me i just dont understand
[08:54:38] <arschmitz> its not like its just one clone or one server or one computer 
[08:54:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, if you feel like it, fix the test as though it was a real failure. At least you'll see the root cause and maybe that'll send you off to fix something that isn't even in the library ... *shrug* ...
[08:55:01] <arschmitz> its everything i try :(
[08:55:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its not even the same tests that fail some fail 36 tests others 37 others 48 lol
[08:55:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we're passing throught a cloud of dark matter :)
[08:56:58] <arschmitz> i dont get how i got the one clean run on the laptop lol
[08:57:18] <arschmitz> ill be back shortly im rebooting everything lol
[08:57:46] <uGoMobi> chrome has nasty cache
[08:59:03] <uGoMobi> i remember after updating panel unit test and re-run in incognito mode had to refresh couple of times before tests were green
[09:00:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: uGoMobi makes a good point ^
[09:01:32] <arschmitz> across 3 different computers lol?
[09:02:22] <uGoMobi> well that would be bit odd indeed
[09:05:22] <arschmitz> all green on firefox
[09:06:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: aslo... when you leave the tab while the tests are running they fail too
[09:06:33] <uGoMobi> also*

[09:44:14] <johnbender> arschmitz: remember safari and chrome are not the same thing at all
[09:44:26] <johnbender> at some point we'll automate that
[09:44:29] <johnbender> but not yet
[09:44:29] <arschmitz> johnbender: i know its just those fail
[09:44:47] <arschmitz> i clone onto my server and other people get failures too
[09:44:49] <johnbender> arschmitz: hmmm, does it pass on the command line?
[09:45:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: it could be a dependency issue
[09:45:06] <johnbender> load order
[09:45:28] <arschmitz> why would that be different depending on what system its cloned on?
[09:45:57] <johnbender> arschmitz: well if the depedencies does correctly force the order in which the code is loaded and there is an implicit order dependency
[09:46:08] <johnbender> then anything could affect which gets loaded first
[09:46:13] <johnbender> eg, network latency
[09:46:15] <johnbender> you computer 
[09:46:16] <johnbender> etc
[09:46:18] <johnbender> could be anything
[09:46:24] <johnbender> its a threaded system at that point
[09:46:34] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok
[09:47:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm getting a ton of failures in sequence-path1-path2-dialog-hash-key-tests.html ...
[09:47:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: phantomjs/Linux ...
[09:47:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats what i was getting them in
[09:47:31] <arschmitz> wait no sorry
[09:47:36] <arschmitz> read too quick
[09:47:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... weird that it works with my local copy.
[09:47:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Bad though that it fails ...
[09:48:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! /All/ the tests on that page failed.
[09:48:55] <arschmitz>  in unit/navigation/index.html the tests start failing on 18 and 19 
[09:49:08] <arschmitz> the dialog tests
[09:49:17] <arschmitz> so this might be related
[09:50:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: try this im betting you get lots of failures http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/master/tests/unit/navigation/index.html
[09:50:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi did and its just a clone of master 
[09:52:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, the sequence tests are definitely suffering even in phantomjs ...
[09:53:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I'm seeing red ..
[09:53:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats what iv been seeing al morning lol
[09:53:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: toddmparker: need some feedback on something
[09:53:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe we should test things like this. Timings are different when you're going over a real network than when you're going over localhost.
[09:54:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah something is weird
[09:54:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's why we have the tests load async
[09:54:29] <johnbender> so we catch stuff like that
[09:54:32] <johnbender> assuming that's the issue
[09:55:57] <arschmitz> johnbender: so are you saying these shouldnt nessasarilly pass in a browser only on phantom? 
[09:55:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nono ... I think this is about the difference between AJAX from localhost vs. AJAX from across the world.
[09:56:32] <johnbender> arschmitz: no, they should
[09:57:06] <johnbender> arschmitz: I'm saying that the reason we async load the depenencies in the test is so that if it _could_ be wierd (ie the deps are defined wrong) then we at least have a chance at catching it
[09:57:53] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: the loading from different locals is just one way issues might arise and get fixed
[09:58:29] <johnbender> that was the original reason we did it in the demos and /test/ so that it was more  likely to break
[09:58:42] <johnbender> there were other considerations there though
[09:58:45] <arschmitz> johnbender: so your saying you think there is a dependancy issue in the library that is just getting exposed by the different network latencys or something?
[09:59:03] <johnbender> arschmitz: exactly
[09:59:12] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok now im following you
[09:59:13] <johnbender> arschmitz: that's my guess standing outside with no information
[09:59:29] <johnbender> I don't know what you guys are doing or working on so take that into account first :)
[09:59:47] <arschmitz> johnbender: all im doing is cloning master and runing navigation tests
[10:00:04] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah then it's probably a dependency issue
[10:00:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: toddmparker: ping me when you guys are arround
[10:00:24] <arschmitz> johnbender im seeing it but other people are not unless they run it off my server
[10:00:30] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I am back
[10:01:04] <uGoMobi> just reading Android history bug
[10:01:06] <uGoMobi> :(
[10:01:23] <arschmitz> johnbender: that history api bug is crazy 
[10:01:29] <arschmitz> why would they do such a thing!
[10:01:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm seeing a nav sequence failure when using navbars: http://jsbin.com/amozef/77 -> Login -> Alpha -> Beta <- Back
[10:01:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: You should be at Alpha, but you're at login.
[10:02:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi: the stupid stupid thing is that replace state and the history object are both defined
[10:02:03] <johnbender> ...
[10:02:03] <johnbender> wtf
[10:02:15] <arschmitz> johnbender: and kinda work
[10:02:29] <arschmitz> if you refresh it replaces the state to what it should have been?
[10:02:49] <arschmitz> johnbender: thats wack lol
[10:03:02] <uGoMobi> it is
[10:03:26] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it appears to work, so I'm not sure what to do
[10:03:35] <johnbender> I mean, in theory we should dump it out of history support
[10:04:03] <johnbender> because we can't be sure of wierd interactions down the road
[10:04:37] <uGoMobi> hmm
[10:08:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im going to try 1.2-stable and see what happens with nav tests just for fun lol
[10:11:04] <johnbender> arschmitz: remember the dependencies were different
[10:11:12] <johnbender> it's likely there won't be any issues
[10:11:23] <arschmitz> johnbender: actually it blows up too
[10:11:26] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15karthio opened issue #5462: Numbers rounding off issue  02http://git.io/jktAoQ
[10:11:36] <johnbender> arschmitz: o.o
[10:12:01] <Wilto> still not here
[10:12:13] <arschmitz> johnbender 18 failed tests
[10:13:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It seems like it's a bad day for nav ... I just found a navbar issues: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/CIDIC.html -> Login -> Alpha -> Beta <- Back takes you to "Login", not "Alpha" ...
[10:13:44] <CIDIC> it seems like that first nav button gets skipped for some reason
[10:14:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ugh so maybe there are some real issues here
[10:15:38] <CIDIC> aside from the un-changeable nature of the nav widget ?
[10:15:49] <CIDIC> is there anything I can contribute to help make this thing better?
[10:16:36] <CIDIC> the navbar
[10:16:36] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: The only thing better than reporting these issues accurately is if you send us PRs with some fixes ...
[10:17:17] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: is there a plan with how to improve this thing int he next version?
[10:17:49] <_|Nix|_> Not that I know of.
[10:18:11] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: But, if you have some ideas, I think you'll find a great many ears open here.
[10:18:14] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: I would like to submit a bug then… ;)
[10:19:00] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: By all means.
[10:19:12] <CIDIC> if the navbar has to be repeated in markup across all pages, thats fine. but there needs to be a way to re-render them  ALL
[10:19:15] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/
[10:19:44] <CIDIC> and it shouldn't matter if it is slow, it isn't going to happen that often, it is going to be like this case, where a user is logged in and has different nav.
[10:19:56] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: I'm actually kinda surprised that it's getting copied over. I hope it's not a regression. I thought we were /moving/ it from page to page, not copying it.
[10:20:34] <CIDIC> _|Nix|_: I don't believe so, in the docs, and how I've gotten it to work, you need to repeat the nav markup on each page
[10:20:44] <CIDIC> and every page change it hides, and shows them.
[10:21:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no navbars get replaced on page show
[10:21:14] <arschmitz> thats the intended behivor
[10:21:42] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: Maybe you just need to set the ID on each page to be the same, but not the whole contents.
[10:21:42] <arschmitz> navbars are never truely persistant
[10:21:48] <CIDIC> having to copy , paste, and slightly change the markup of the nav for each page is not fun
[10:22:05] <arschmitz> CIDIC: sorry that is how they work currently
[10:22:22] <arschmitz> they are tied to a specific page 
[10:22:27] <CIDIC> I get it, it is needed to make a smooth transition
[10:22:35] <arschmitz> all our widgets are coupled to the page they are in
[10:22:36] <CIDIC> I am assuming
[10:22:52] <arschmitz> CIDIC we are looking into freeing widgets from pages for 1.4
[10:23:18] <arschmitz> CIDIC i actually made a branch last week which does free navbars and toolbars from pages
[10:23:23] <CIDIC> they are coupled to the pagecreate beforepagecreate etc events?
[10:23:34] <CIDIC> arschmitz: what do you mean when you say frees?
[10:23:46] <arschmitz> makes it so a toolbar and live outside a page
[10:23:59] <arschmitz> so you can have just one toolbar which will persist 
[10:24:22] <arschmitz> which if i follow is what you are looking for
[10:25:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: however what you are seeing with the sequence is something else thats broken in nav for multi page documents it seems
[10:25:38] <CIDIC> arschmitz: that would solve my complaint of writing repeat markup but not the inflexibility of changing the buttons in the navbar
[10:26:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it looks like when you navigate back to the original page of a multipage document no history entry is created
[10:26:29] <arschmitz> CIDIC: if there was only one you could destory and recreate it to change anything you wanted
[10:26:39] <CIDIC> arschmitz: the first page of the multipage id kind of an anomoly it doesn't behave like any other page load/change event
[10:26:51] <CIDIC> arschmitz: true
[10:26:57] <CIDIC> do you have a link to this branch?
[10:26:58] <arschmitz> CIDIC: yes that is a bug in our nav it looks like 
[10:27:20] <arschmitz> CIDIC no i only have it local its no where near production read it was a quick hack and slash just ot test the concept
[10:27:38] <arschmitz> i can push it to my own repo / fork if you would like to look at it though
[10:27:39] <CIDIC> the first page of the multipage is not just an anomly in the navbar in how it fires events, and initializes the page
[10:28:05] <arschmitz> CIDIC yes when i say nav i dont mean navbar i mean our navigation 
[10:28:58] <arschmitz> johnbender: you might be the person to look into this?
[10:29:23] <CIDIC> is there any plan to implement any sort of routing for jqm?
[10:30:25] <arschmitz> CIDIC: what exactly do you mean by routing? 
[10:30:49] <CIDIC> something like this https://github.com/azicchetti/jquerymobile-router
[10:31:06] <CIDIC> but Ideally less frustrating lol
[10:32:31] <CIDIC> arschmitz: let me ask it differently. if you need to make a page in jqm that is like index.php#book?id=99, how would you set it up to fetch the data for book with id 99 and render them in the view?
[10:33:08] <johnbender> CIDIC: we don't have any plans to implement a router
[10:33:23] <CIDIC> what would your suggestion be for that case?
[10:33:37] <johnbender> CIDIC: there are some posts out there about how to work with backbone's router
[10:33:56] <arschmitz> johnbender: issue: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/CIDIC.html -> Login -> Alpha -> Beta <- Back takes you to "Login", not "Alpha" ...
[10:33:57] <johnbender> CIDIC: if you want to get close to the metal we buildthe navigate method to work in those kinds of siutations
[10:34:14] <arschmitz> looks like going back to the inital page is not createing a new history entry 
[10:34:40] <johnbender> CIDIC: can you reproduce it in a fiddle/jsbin so we can examine/
[10:34:57] <CIDIC> the navigation bug?
[10:35:00] <johnbender> it's hard to look at other people's code and know where the interactions might be
[10:35:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: http://jsbin.com/amozef/88
[10:35:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: http://jsbin.com/amozef/88 -> Page 3 -> Page 1 -> Page 2 <- Back
[10:35:18] <arschmitz> johnbender: thats _|Nix|_ site lol
[10:35:31] <CIDIC> that doesn't appear to be rendering properly
[10:35:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The location looks correct afterwards but the wrong page is displayed.
[10:35:52] <CIDIC> http://jsbin.com/amozef/87
[10:36:14] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: /88 is a stripped-down version of /87 ...
[10:36:18] <CIDIC> oh
[10:36:27] <_|Nix|_> CIDIC: With just the links and no navbar, to keep issues separate.
[10:36:35] <CIDIC> gotcha
[10:37:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it looks like it's coercing the initial page hash to be nothing instead of the id
[10:37:37] <johnbender> since page one is the initial page
[10:37:40] <CIDIC> johnbender: do you have any links to docs, or source that would help me dig into the navigate method?
[10:37:59] <CIDIC> johnbender: that is a known issue I thought
[10:38:20] <johnbender> CIDIC http://api.jquerymobile.com/jQuery.mobile.navigate/
[10:38:22] <CIDIC> it is mentioned here
[10:38:24] <CIDIC> https://github.com/azicchetti/jquerymobile-router
[10:38:32] <CIDIC> If you're using a multipage template in your jquerymobile application, the first displayed page is quite an "anomaly" in the navigation model, because, even if it has its own id, this is not reflected in the hash. This doesn't happen for other pages. This "empty hash" problem may come into play when the back button is used by the user. Since writing an "empty" regular expression such as "^$" to match this page seems really strange, the router will acce
[10:38:32] <CIDIC> only a route with the page id, for example "#foobar"
[10:39:04] <johnbender> CIDIC the navigate method is the "metal" of our navigation
[10:39:10] <johnbender> it handles the history management
[10:39:20] <johnbender> you can load content in any way you want based on that
[10:39:44] <johnbender> CIDIC: the second example is how you would build something like pjax
[10:39:48] <CIDIC> johnbender: would it also be the place to get url / hash params and tell the page / which page what to do?
[10:40:00] <johnbender> CIDIC that would be the navigate event binding
[10:40:39] <johnbender> CIDIC: so when the browser moves backward or forward navigate will get fired with the state you associated with the url with $.mobile.navigate
[10:42:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: Wilto: are either of you interested in checkin this ua sniff I added to opt android > 2.3 out of push/replacestate ?
[10:43:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ the nav bug for multipage inital page is firefox too
[10:43:47] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ as CIDIC pointed out it's known
[10:44:01] <johnbender> uGoMobi: Wilto https://gist.github.com/b0fa7eb3e6989f1dbca0
[10:46:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Lemme guess: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3654?
[10:47:35] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no that one is solved
[10:47:40] <johnbender> with the new nav
[10:47:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah ... just noticed ...
[10:48:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, which is it then?
[10:48:09] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I was wondering.... could it be the issue doesn't affect all android 2.3+ devices?
[10:48:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's just that the first page isn't going to change the url with it's ID
[10:48:21] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it doesn't affect any as far as I know
[10:48:27] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I get the impression it is a default setting that has been changed
[10:48:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it's only > 2.3
[10:48:52] <uGoMobi> so maybe OEM can turn it on
[10:49:13] <uGoMobi> I tested on Galaxy Nexus... vanilla Android
[10:49:23] <johnbender> ...
[10:49:26] <johnbender> and it worked?
[10:49:30] <johnbender> fml
[10:49:35] <uGoMobi> no it didn't
[10:49:41] <johnbender> ah
[10:49:43] <johnbender> I'm not sure
[10:49:50] <uGoMobi> but that's because the default will be used
[10:50:06] <johnbender> frankly if we don't know how can we support it
[10:50:07] <uGoMobi> but maybe Samsung set it to true
[10:50:26] <johnbender> uGoMobi: Im so confused, it was or was not working on your Nexus
[10:50:28] <johnbender> ?
[10:50:36] <uGoMobi> not working on Nexus
[10:50:38] <johnbender> that is, it replaced the ulr properly
[10:50:39] <johnbender> or
[10:50:58] <johnbender> that's consistent since the Galaxy Nexus was > 2.3
[10:51:04] <johnbender> s/or/ok/
[10:51:15] <uGoMobi> not working means I saw what I put in the comment on the issue
[10:51:27] <uGoMobi> yes vanilla Android 4.1
[10:51:51] <uGoMobi> just saying... maybe it does work as expected on a Samsung Android 4.1 device
[10:52:30] <johnbender> uGoMobi: the url updates but it doesn't replaceState
[10:52:44] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that is, the hash gets set properly but it doesn't get squashed
[10:52:45] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes, that is what I saw
[10:52:55] <uGoMobi> correct
[10:52:57] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that's what I'm addressing
[10:53:05] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5381#issuecomment-12312058
[10:53:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: so where have you seen it workign properly?
[10:54:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm still confused
[10:54:16] <johnbender> since everything you've said is consistent with why I'm disabling support for greater than 2.3
[10:54:28] <johnbender> that is, what are you saying about vendors enabling it?
[10:54:52] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I don't know if they do, but it could be
[10:55:07] <uGoMobi> we would have to test on other than Nexus devices
[10:55:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: true, but I'd rather just disable it
[10:55:56] <uGoMobi> johnbender: the reason I am saying this is because the issue is caused by Android changing the default for history API from enabled to disabled
[10:55:58] <johnbender> if we can't be sure
[10:56:17] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:56:26] <johnbender> uGoMobi: we'll ask Todd
[10:56:58] <uGoMobi> I only have Nexus
[10:57:26] <uGoMobi> I am just surprised the issue is one year old and it has never been reported before
[10:57:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it doesn't appear to affect the actual functionality at all
[10:57:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: maybe leave well enough alone 
[10:57:53] <uGoMobi> johnbender: true
[10:58:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: not sure though
[10:58:20] <arschmitz> johnbender: thats tough since it "works" as is kinda but does not look right
[11:02:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: johnbender: so i got tests to pass for me on chrome 
[11:02:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: johnbender: had to turn off wifi so i had no network connection ????
[11:04:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: lol
[11:05:14] <arschmitz> i have no idea why it would matter lol
[11:09:14] <toddmparker> hey all
[11:09:19] <toddmparker> here I am
[11:09:24] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5461
[11:09:37] <toddmparker> did you cherry pick the fix to 1.2-stable?
[11:14:43] <uGoMobi> johnbender: re: https://gist.github.com/b0fa7eb3e6989f1dbca0
[11:15:18] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I think this should be OR instead of AND ..( ua.search(/CriOS/) === -1 ) && ( ua.search(/Android/) ....
[11:16:35] <johnbender> uGoMobi: the first set of boolean values will be true for android devices > 2.3
[11:16:57] <johnbender> in english:
[11:17:37] <johnbender> if the history object has both pushstate/popstate AND it's not chrome for iOS AND if the browser is android it has to be greater than 2.3
[11:18:32] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ah ok, sorry my bad
[11:18:53] <uGoMobi> it has to match all criteria
[11:19:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it's confusing :( :(
[11:22:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: do you have a Android 4.0/4.1 device there other than Nexus?
[11:23:37] <johnbender> uGoMobi: nope I have stock android on my Nexus S 
[11:23:51] <uGoMobi> same here
[11:29:35] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I am going to ask the issue reporter if the url does update when using latest code and what the url looks like
[11:29:49] <uGoMobi> johnbender: he reporter the issue for Android 3.x
[11:30:05] <uGoMobi> johnbender: so that can't be a Nexus device
[11:30:29] <johnbender> yar
[11:30:35] <johnbender> toddmparker: you around
[11:31:12] <johnbender> scottjehl______: toddmparker: Wilto: kinblas: gseguin: question for you guys
[11:31:17] <uGoMobi> if the url does update now but replaceState also not working on his device we know a bit more
[11:31:29] <johnbender> I don't recall what the exact purpose of hashListentingEnabled is
[11:31:47] <johnbender> obviously it prevents hash assignment from triggering navigation events
[11:32:09] <johnbender> but also kind of prevents history management all together doesn't it?
[11:32:31] <johnbender> do we just opt out of nav entirely when $.mobile.hashListentingEnabled === false?
[11:32:40] <johnbender> I'm having a hard time remembering
[11:42:29] <kinblas> johnbender: doesn't setting location.hash manually add an entry on the history stack?
[11:42:45] * kinblas notes he's a bit rusty since it's been a long long while
[11:43:01] <kinblas> johnbender: that is the crux of your question right?
[11:52:50] <toddmparker> sorry fellas, got pulled away
[11:55:05] <johnbender> kinblas: yes, well it sometimes does
[11:55:18] <johnbender> kinblas: recall that moving backward and forward in history is essentially the same thing
[11:55:49] <kinblas> johnbender: by history stack I meant the browser .. not jqm
[11:56:02] <kinblas> johnbender: sorry gotta step out … I'll be back 'round 4pm-ish
[11:56:13] <johnbender> kinblas: yessir you are correct
[11:57:03] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: we have a galaxy nexus, galaxy 7
[11:57:15] <toddmparker> sorry
[12:09:19] <gseguin> johnbender: wasn't that used by ignoreNextHashchange or something in the like?
[12:09:58] <johnbender> gseguin: yes
[12:10:33] <banzor> howdy folks
[12:10:37] <johnbender> gseguin: Looking at it made me thing it would just globally ignore hashchanges
[12:10:41] <johnbender> *think
[12:11:01] <johnbender> gseguin: the way I have it set up now, if hashListeningEnabled === false
[12:11:10] <gseguin> it's not set anywhere in the code though, is it?
[12:11:20] <johnbender> gseguin: nope
[12:11:27] <johnbender> gseguin: it's a setting
[12:11:42] <gseguin> is it documented?
[12:11:46] <johnbender> gseguin: sort of
[12:11:54] <banzor> we just released an alpha of a new jQM widget called AppView. Thought you might be interested in seeing it. http://wijmo.com/demo/v3/Wijmo-Complete/development-bundle/samples-mobile/appview/widgets/index.html 
[12:12:27] <johnbender> the way I have it set up with my fix is that stops hash/replace handling all together
[12:12:30] <johnbender> changepage still alters the url
[12:12:41] <johnbender> (or should) but it won't do anything when going back or forward
[12:12:45] <johnbender> or on hash assignment
[12:12:47] <johnbender> it's just off
[12:14:40] <gseguin> thanks for sharing banzor 
[12:15:44] <johnbender> gseguin: that fits with some of the expectation in the backbone + jqm posts
[12:15:52] <johnbender> ie, changePage should just be a content loader
[12:16:01] <johnbender> and they use backbones router
[12:19:17] <banzor> We tried to use as many jQM API's as possible, but had to diverge for certain things. For example, we would like to use changePage, to not want to recreate the entire doc/page. We do use loadPage, but have to do our own history state management. Anyways, we might have some good feedback on extensibility of page methods if you are interested.
[12:20:28] <johnbender> banzor: nice
[12:20:40] <johnbender> banzor: might want to take a look at the new navigate method and event
[12:20:54] <banzor> is that new in 1.3?
[12:20:55] <johnbender> it's the jqm history managment extracted
[12:20:57] <johnbender> banzor: yes
[12:21:04] <banzor> oh snap, nice!
[12:21:09] <banzor> that exactly what we need
[12:21:14] <johnbender> it normalizes hashchange and popstate to a single event
[12:21:27] <johnbender> and allows for the association of state with a url in both cases
[12:21:39] <johnbender> via the $.mobile.navigate method
[12:22:00] <johnbender> banzor: it's available as a module too
[12:22:47] <johnbender> banzor: I don't think we have a way to disable the current navigation event binding but you could probably disable it anyway
[12:23:10] <banzor> excellent, will give that a try
[12:23:20] <johnbender> banzor: your feedback would be extremely valuable
[12:23:34] <banzor> We will try it out and send some feedback
[12:23:39] <johnbender> since it was developed to be used standalone but obviously it has to meet our requirements
[12:23:47] <johnbender> that is, we ony have one use case
[12:23:51] <johnbender> banzor: cool
[12:23:52] <johnbender> thanks :)
[12:24:14] <banzor> Well, we certainly could use it
[12:24:59] <banzor> we found that we have been "fighting" the history in jQM with AppView so this seems like it will help
[12:25:22] <banzor> Also, do you have any plans to allow ListView to work outside of Page?
[12:26:02] <johnbender> banzor: we're considering making many of the widgets stand alone
[12:26:11] <johnbender> I think some of that work has started already
[12:26:12] <johnbender> arschmitz: ?
[12:26:17] <banzor> Ideally, I would like to treat the right column of our AppView as Page container and use changepage there. Then have our menu be a persisten ListView outside the Page
[12:26:24] <johnbender> banzor: heading the gym, I should be back in an hour or so
[12:26:34] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah we are looking at it for 1.4
[12:26:35] <banzor> kk, thanks for the info!
[12:26:41] <johnbender> banzor: we have plans to move the nav functionality into a container widget
[12:26:47] <johnbender> eg, many on one page
[12:26:49] <johnbender> we'll see
[12:26:54] <arschmitz> i started working on a few widgets but just as a real quick hack and slash test
[12:26:55] <johnbender> s/eg/ie/
[12:27:23] <johnbender> banzor: "nav functionality" == that which hasn't been extracted already
[12:27:57] <banzor> that would help also
[12:28:31] <arschmitz> banzor: johnbender: listview is on the list of ones we are working on extracting from pages
[12:29:51] <banzor> arschmitz, that would be ideal. We had to hack appView all into a single page for now. Ideally it would be much more integrated with jQM APIs
[12:30:21] <arschmitz> banzor: we are looking at a lot of major changes to widgets and page containers for 1.4
[12:31:04] <banzor> Any time frames for 1.4? We would like to work parallel to make AppView using any new API's you are planning
[12:31:32] <arschmitz> banzor: well 1.3beta1 just came out monday lol
[12:31:54] <banzor> yeah, I see that :) Which has a new API that we need to test now.
[12:32:01] <arschmitz> but we are hoping for early second quarter
[12:32:18] <banzor> ok, just curious
[12:32:26] <arschmitz> but to be honest no work has even started on 1.4 yet just planing so we will keep our fingers crossed lol
[12:33:10] <banzor> Well, we will put together some feedback on 1.3 asap so that it can help with 1.4 planning
[12:33:19] <arschmitz> cool
[12:34:06] <banzor> i am absolutely in love with jqm btw. It has been fun to work with.
[12:34:27] <arschmitz> banzor: awesome its great to hear
[12:35:00] <arschmitz> 1.4 is going to be mainly about improving the internals of the framework instead of new features
[12:35:54] <banzor> awesome, well we are mainly using the framework. I would love to be able to make AppView using all jQM API
[12:37:23] <arschmitz> banzor: one of our long term goals is to incorperate something like this directly into jqm if you look at our roadmap wiki its slated for 1.6 right now
[12:37:47] <arschmitz> so much of whats before then is setting the ground work for this
[12:38:47] <banzor> Sure, in the meantime, send them our way ;)
[12:39:34] <arschmitz> yeah we do our best to document some of the 3rd party widgets we find and add them to the resources section
[12:42:40] <banzor> well, you guys are doing great work. 
[12:43:49] <arschmitz> banzor: thank you very much we all work really hard to make JQM the best it can be and really appreciate that you like it so much
[12:56:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: There was no fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5461
[12:56:58] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Dragooon opened issue #5463: Panels should append to the URL history/be closable through the back button  02http://git.io/aqimeQ
[12:57:13] <_|Nix|_> Ha ha! ^
[12:59:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It was a bad demo. I fixed the demo and with the fixed version I couldn't reproduce the bug.
[13:00:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, banzor: Actually, if we do manage to push through the on-the-fly option changes, that will be a major new feature promised since like, forever by virtue of the fact that we're using the UI widget factory, but never delivered.
[13:01:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah i suppose you could call that a feature
[13:03:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, johnbender: Were you guys able to figure out that multi-page history skipping thing? I wouldn't mind taking a look ...
[13:03:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: johnbender said its a known documented issue
[13:03:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that there is no fix
[13:03:52] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... OK ...
[13:05:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im really not so sure though since it works with 1.2
[13:05:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/amozef/90
[13:06:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think things got confused because of other issues being raised by CIDC at the same time that were not related
[13:22:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There was a fix in 1.1.0 too ...
[13:22:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe I'll dive into it tomorrow ..
[13:23:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i just havent had time to dig in today
[13:23:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but i think its a bug for sure
[13:34:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: it's known where the router is concerned, we should probably look into why the jsbin is behaving that way
[13:35:01] <arschmitz> johnbender: the jsbin is fine in 1.2 and 1.1 so this is a regression
[13:37:31] <arschmitz> johnbender: i think there was confusion before because _|Nix|_ and i were not talking about router at all we were talking about just a normal multipage template not making history entries for first page
[13:40:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, the history is fine, but the value passed to _handleHashChange is wrong.
[13:41:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ah i see
[13:41:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... so _handleHashChange ends up loading the wrong page.
[13:41:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... correction the history /seems/ fine, because the location shows the first page, like it's supposed to.
[13:42:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll trace the code from popstate until _handleHashChange to see why _handleHashChange ends up getting the wrong value.
[13:42:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool like i said i havent really looked into it yet
[13:42:40] <arschmitz> but that sounds right from what iv seen
[13:43:24] <_|Nix|_> Yaaay! It works with pushState disabled :)
[13:43:49] <arschmitz> lol pretty soon we are not going to be able to use push state at all i feel like
[13:44:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Unless we drop iOS 4 or whatever, which doesn't implement pushState, but only replaceState IIUC ...
[13:44:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ push state dosent use push state it only uses replace state last i checked?
[13:44:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ideally, pushState and hashchange would be mutually exclusive, but because of iOS 4 we need to use them together, which is creating a ton of problems.
[13:45:47] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/0e317440f339f200a300611f105b7486de3bad14
[13:45:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes, but because of that, we have to listen to 2 events to make the nav work, and that's terrible.
[13:46:03] <jlembeck> question: why not just add a radix? (all i have for background is the commit message)
[13:46:24] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/ZenjxA

[13:46:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: couldnt we just kick ios4 out of pushstate?
[13:46:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ^
[13:47:30] <arschmitz> ios 4 is down under 7% of ios installs and its not like it wouldnt work just would be hash only
[13:47:39] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: hi! good point
[13:47:44] <Wilto> I’d be okay with that, actually.
[13:47:50] <Wilto> arschmitz, johnbender ^
[13:48:00] <Wilto> WAY TO PICK FIGHTS JLEMBECK
[13:48:13] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: this should have been parseInt with radix
[13:49:24] <arschmitz> Wilto: are you saying you would be good with kicking ios4 out of pushstate?
[13:50:31] <jlembeck> arschmitz: my experience building apps thus far is iOS 4 ends up getting no pushstate in the first place (I've had to turn it off quite a few times)
[13:51:02] <arschmitz> jlembeck: yeah its pretty messed up with it
[13:51:13] <arschmitz> jlembeck: thats why im suggestiing kicking it out
[13:51:34] <arschmitz> if it saves a lot of nav complexity and buggieness i think it only makes sense 
[13:52:01] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: want me to change it?
[13:52:29] <jlembeck> uGoMobi: I was going to ask you the same question, ha. Either or is fine, we're on a freeze on master, right?
[13:52:57] <arschmitz> jlembeck only for features not bugs
[13:53:00] <uGoMobi> well it's beta so I think  fix like this before RC should be ok
[13:53:27] <jlembeck> oh cool, I'll pop it in there
[13:53:38] <uGoMobi> jlembeck: ok cool
[13:53:41] <uGoMobi> and thanks!

[14:03:57] <johnbender> arschmitz: we could
[14:04:09] <johnbender> arschmitz: why are you asking?
[14:04:24] <johnbender> just for simplicity's sake?
[14:04:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: was talking about issues with hash vs replace state in ios4
[14:04:57] <arschmitz> and if i recale you and i had a similar disscussion a week or 2 ago
[14:05:30] <arschmitz> johnbender: so i was thinking its a pretty fringe browsers at this point why not just kick it out to hash only?
[14:06:04] <arschmitz> johnbender: if it will solve a bunch of buggieness and simplify the nav i think its worth it 
[14:18:05] <arschmitz> well im heading home all have a good night i should be back in a while
[14:19:28] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's a good thought
[14:20:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: uGoMobi: something happened recently which made the nav tests less stasble
[14:20:03] <johnbender> *stable
[14:20:08] <johnbender> both the old and git are broken
[14:20:13] <johnbender> in the same way that master just broke
[14:20:36] <arschmitz> johnbender: i fixed git something breaking git thismorning
[14:20:49] <johnbender> hmmm
[14:21:14] <arschmitz> johnbender: they droped $.event.handle before releasing 1.9 yesterdayh
[14:21:25] <johnbender> ah
[14:21:33] <johnbender> do we have an open issue for that?
[14:21:35] <arschmitz> talked to DaveMethvin about it last night and commited fix this moring
[14:21:39] <johnbender> I feel like I saw one
[14:21:46] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool
[14:21:58] <uGoMobi> did we update master to 1.9 already?
[14:22:04] <arschmitz> no
[14:22:09] <arschmitz> that was only for git
[14:22:13] <uGoMobi> shall we do that?

[14:24:35] <arschmitz> johnbender: im not sure about master
[14:24:50] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah it looks like similar failures but who knows
[14:24:51] <arschmitz> phantom master that is
[14:25:51] <arschmitz> johnbender: if you look at the output from git this moring you will see its all $event.handle.call undefined and then all the touch events of course fail
[14:26:58] <arschmitz> but then there are a bunch of timeout fails at the bottom not sure about those and those are the same on git and master
[14:27:05] <arschmitz> master also has 2 nav fails though
[14:27:11] <arschmitz> phantom master*
[14:28:11] <Wilto> Someone call for Phantom Master Marquis?
[14:28:18] <Wilto> Oh. False alarm.
[14:28:44] <arschmitz> johnbender: phantom master just passed the two nav tests it failed on last run
[14:31:12] <johnbender> arschmitz: failing still
[14:31:13] <arschmitz> johnbender: looks like something is unstable though since the last commit had nothing to do with the tests that failed
[14:31:24] <arschmitz> are you talking about the timeouts at the end?
[14:31:30] <arschmitz> johnbender?
[14:31:44] <johnbender> arschmitz: not sure what you mean
[14:31:52] <johnbender> arschmitz: I haven't looked at the commits
[14:32:02] <arschmitz> like if you look at the console output in jenkins
[14:32:43] <arschmitz> sorry i always look at the jenkins console output
[14:32:52] <johnbender> same here
[14:33:20] <arschmitz> the current run is timeing out on a bunch of tests at the end
[14:33:32] <arschmitz> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1068/console
[14:33:57] <arschmitz> its been doing this everywhere for a while i mentioned it once before
[14:33:58] <johnbender> yah that's what I was seeing
[14:34:14] <arschmitz> it still shows as a green run when this happens though?
[14:34:51] <johnbender> arschmitz: hmm it appears to
[14:34:55] <johnbender> that's not good 
[14:34:57] <johnbender> sigh
[14:35:14] <arschmitz> johnbender: thats why i was asking the run a few minutes ago that failed had actual failed tests
[14:35:20] <arschmitz> so did the last git build
[14:37:41] <arschmitz> johnbender: it started here http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1028/
[14:37:46] <johnbender> yah
[14:38:44] <arschmitz> so im guessing it has to do with _Nix|_: adding that feature? 
[14:39:01] <johnbender> arschmitz: don't think so
[14:39:07] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's just the push state disabled tests
[14:39:09] <johnbender> very odd
[14:39:11] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[14:39:30] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah thats why i asked the question it didnt seem related
[14:39:35] <johnbender> arschmitz: ....
[14:39:39] <johnbender> wtf
[14:39:40] <arschmitz> so maybe something that change in core
[14:39:54] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah i told you it shows as success with those timeouts
[14:40:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: 99% likelyhood that this is a load order issue
[14:40:33] <arschmitz> johnbender: maybe this is what i was seeing all day
[14:40:36] <arschmitz> local
[14:40:39] <johnbender> likely
[14:40:59] <johnbender> not super dangerous where the library is concerned since we don't support loading async
[14:41:05] <johnbender> but it _could_ manifest in the build
[14:41:10] <johnbender> (unlikely)
[14:41:11] <arschmitz> johnbender: i noticed it last week when fixing some broken builds and mentioned it but clearly didnt yell loud enough ha ha 
[14:41:20] <johnbender> arschmitz: sorry
[14:41:27] <johnbender> I should have been paying attention
[14:41:29] <arschmitz> johnbender: im not even sure i mentioned to you
[14:41:43] <arschmitz> i just brought it up in general not sure who i was talking to 
[14:42:03] <arschmitz> my memory fails me on this one
[14:43:42] <arschmitz> johnbender: so your thinking  this is just our dependancy load order right?
[14:43:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah, because it passed flawlessly most of the time
[14:43:56] <arschmitz> like in jquery.mobile.js?
[14:44:03] <johnbender> and when it doesn't pass it's a complete fail
[14:44:15] <johnbender> arschmitz: no, the test define their own loading
[14:44:30] <arschmitz> oh ok im not super familier with the test suit im trying to get there
[14:44:59] <johnbender> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/unit/navigation/method/index.html#L13
[14:45:17] <johnbender> arschmitz: that's just a wrapper around require
[14:45:20] <arschmitz> ah ok simple enough
[14:45:32] <johnbender> arschmitz: allows us to do chunks of loads that depend on each other
[14:49:03] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok 
[14:49:32] <arschmitz> johnbender: this is probably a dumb question but ...
[14:49:40] <johnbender> unlikely
[14:50:07] <arschmitz> johnbender: does running /tests/navigation/index.html also run /tests/navigation/method/index.html ? 
[14:50:36] <arschmitz> or does each subfolder have to be run seperately to run all the navigation tests
