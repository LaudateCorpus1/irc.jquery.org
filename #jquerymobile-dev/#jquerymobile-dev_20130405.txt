[04:39:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker arschmitz agcolom _|Nix|_ johnbender gseguin: FYI - when you add a label to a ticket on Github you now have to click "update" at the bottom of the popup to apply them.
[04:40:38] <uGoMobi> pretty obvious, except when that "update" button is below the fold (like on my screen)
[04:57:30] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Good to know 
[04:57:41] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[04:57:45] <toddmparker> Hey!
[04:57:50] <uGoMobi> yeah, I found out the hard way :)
[04:58:10] <toddmparker> You blew johnbender's mind with the @import thing
[04:58:32] <toddmparker> I rarely use 'me so I didn't even know there was a limit 
[04:58:33] <uGoMobi> lol yeah
[04:58:42] <uGoMobi> same here
[04:58:51] <toddmparker> I'll update the 1.3.1 post this morning with the last few changes
[04:58:56] <uGoMobi> it's only a good thing if you never ran into that problem
[04:59:01] <toddmparker> Right
[04:59:32] <toddmparker> Is DaveMethvin around? Saw his Q re: web stats. 
[04:59:44] <toddmparker> We don't have anything afaik 
[04:59:46] <DaveMethvin> yep, here
[05:00:06] <DaveMethvin> just wondering whether safari 4 is something we have to support now
[05:00:19] <DaveMethvin> or 5.0x
[05:03:11] <toddmparker> Ah
[05:03:19] <toddmparker> Desktop safari?
[05:03:51] <toddmparker> 5-6
[05:04:06] <toddmparker> Just checked the site
[05:04:17] <toddmparker> DaveMethvin ^
[05:04:52] <DaveMethvin> mostly worried about mobile browsers, since some of them are old toddmparker
[05:07:04] <toddmparker> So iOS versions?
[05:08:07] <toddmparker> We support back to iOS 4 with newer jQ
[05:08:20] <toddmparker> What are you breaking now?
[05:58:15] <gseguin> toddmparker: Builder is fixed and deployed
[05:58:42] <gseguin> toddmparker: ready to test-deploy 1.3.1 when you are
[06:04:22] <toddmparker> gseguin: Great
[06:04:26] <uGoMobi> I am testing panels at the moment... noticed a regression from a fix that landed in 1.3.1 so I am probably going to revert something
[06:04:32] <uGoMobi> won't take long
[06:04:39] <toddmparker> Ok
[06:04:53] <toddmparker> I need to update the demos for 1.3.1
[06:05:34] <toddmparker> And make the intro text smaller on the homepage on phones. 
[06:05:43] <uGoMobi> did we fix that version-dev issue?
[06:05:59] <uGoMobi> or do we have to hardcode the version again?
[06:07:30] <toddmparker> gseguin ^
[06:07:58] <toddmparker> I wanted to see if we ref cdn links anywhere it say 1.3.0
[06:10:15] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think we have to add folder /dist to git ignore
[06:13:10] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Testing 1.3-stable and every time I close a panel, I see a blink
[06:13:13] <toddmparker> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3-stable/demos/widgets/panels/
[06:13:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I know... that's the regression
[06:13:25] <toddmparker> iPhone iOS 6
[06:13:34] <toddmparker> Oooh, ok
[06:13:51] <uGoMobi> I am going to revert the change that caused that
[06:14:20] <uGoMobi> downside is that on iOS Safari and Chrome you will see a blink every time we unfix a fixed panel
[06:15:14] <toddmparker> So worse for fixed, better for not?
[06:15:46] <uGoMobi> yeah seems like best choice
[06:17:30] <toddmparker> Guess so. 
[06:17:40] <toddmparker> Hw accel is such a pain
[06:18:09] <toddmparker> Could we scope things so if fixed, they get current 
[06:18:22] <toddmparker> If not, they get the reverted?

[06:20:09] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 146b939a4 15Jasper de Groot: Revert changes made in commit de18420 (partly) and a6ff7de
[06:22:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the problem is that we only know that we are going to unfix a panel when we are already opening the panel
[06:22:24] <uGoMobi> then it's too late to apply the fix
[06:22:46] <toddmparker> Because of the check to see it it fits 
[06:23:21] <uGoMobi> right, we can only do that after opening because before that the panel height is incorrect due to width 0
[06:23:54] <toddmparker> Could we set width to full but shift it offscreen
[06:24:01] <toddmparker> To get a measure 
[06:24:17] <uGoMobi> I tried that but doesn't work
[06:24:24] <toddmparker> Bah
[06:24:37] <toddmparker> Doesn't give you an accurate height?
[06:24:55] <uGoMobi> it kills the animation
[06:25:16] <toddmparker> Right. Anything like that would add a delay too
[06:25:55] <toddmparker> Tricky
[06:26:04] <toddmparker> Lets revert for now anyway
[06:26:27] <toddmparker> We can refine for the next round 
[06:26:27] <uGoMobi> yeah just did on master, will cherry-pick now
[06:26:32] <toddmparker> Ok
[06:26:52] <uGoMobi> going to open new ticket and write down what I found out
[06:26:53] <toddmparker> What's your thought on the threshold to scroll to top for a panel
[06:27:21] <toddmparker> On our demo pages, the panel opens but doesn't scroll because the threshold must be too high
[06:27:40] <uGoMobi> yes, I think we should make it always scroll to top
[06:28:20] <toddmparker> For now, lets make it a lot smaller
[06:28:23] <uGoMobi> now we only check if the scroll position versus the height of pannel inner
[06:28:25] <toddmparker> Brb
[06:29:10] <uGoMobi> so we only check if at least the panel bottom is in view and if so we don't scroll

[06:45:04] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I forget why we even added that threshold
[06:45:24] <toddmparker> I guess just to avoid jump unless if you're scrolled a small bit
[06:45:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: to be honest, I don't recall either
[06:45:49] <toddmparker> 99.9% of the time, panels open from top buttons
[06:45:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, must be something like that
[06:45:55] <toddmparker> In the header
[06:46:25] <uGoMobi> do you think we should change it in 1.3.1 or wait until 1.4?
[06:47:59] <toddmparker> That's a tricky one
[06:48:15] <toddmparker> We can wait
[06:49:00] <uGoMobi> didn't see tickets that complain about this
[06:49:33] <uGoMobi> ok, I'll make a ticket for 1.4
[06:50:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: BTW - do we have to wait with changing API docs for 1.4 until just before release?
[06:51:13] <uGoMobi> not sure how that works with different versions
[06:54:16] <toddmparker> Ok
[06:54:33] <toddmparker> We need to ask agcolom how versioning works

[07:37:24] <uGoMobi> let it live for a while on master first
[07:37:36] <uGoMobi> we can move that to 1.3.2
[07:38:13] <uGoMobi> based on his comments on that other issue I don't expect a quick

[07:49:28] <uGoMobi> let's try again after 1.4 release :D
[07:49:39] <gseguin> something is up with demos/examples/maps/jquery.gmap.js

[08:33:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: and yes the basetag thing should be for the next release if not for 1.4
[08:34:08] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:34:23] <toddmparker> johnbender: ok, so I should move those two issues to 1.3.2 for now?
[08:34:44] <toddmparker> moved.
[08:34:48] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah I would, that init thing might end up being complex
[08:34:53] <toddmparker> ok, all issues are closed for 1.3.1
[08:34:59] <johnbender> I'm not sure if or how that was working prior to the nav refactor

[09:06:47] <uGoMobi> ok lemme check
[09:07:36] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#250 (1.3-stable - 85d118c : Todd Parker): The build is still failing.

[09:14:43] <jonathansampson> Has their been much discussion around using more semantic tags in the jQuery Mobile documentation? <header data-role="header"> vs <div data-role="header">
[09:19:11] <uGoMobi> johnbender: we still support IE7/8 where you need to load an html5shiv to make that work
[09:19:21] <uGoMobi> jonathansampson: ^^
[09:19:28] <uGoMobi> (sorry, wrong name)
[09:19:51] <jonathansampson> uGoMobi: Thank you. I suspected it might have had something to do with legacy support.
[09:21:05] <toddmparker> jonathansampson: yeah, we could look at adding those but we'd still style against divs for now
[09:21:38] <jonathansampson> What do you mean, style against divs? Are you explicitly including the tagname in the CSS selector?
[09:21:43] <toddmparker> we found using shim/shivs was a bit wonky when using ajax, sometimes elements would confuse ie
[09:22:15] <toddmparker>  <header><div data-role="header">content</div></header>
[09:22:38] <toddmparker> we'd still write styles against the div, the html5 element would just be for semantics
[09:22:57] <toddmparker> but it just adds more markup with not a ton of value atm
[09:24:12] <jonathansampson> toddmparker: Correct; you're saying that if you did provide shims for header, footer, etc., you would still encourage people to place the data-role attributes on nested divs rather than on the more semantic tags for the sake of avoiding issues with ajax and oldIE?

[09:31:43] <toddmparker> jonathansampson: right. but i'm not 100% sure that things will work well if you start wrapping the header/content/footer elements
[09:32:21] <toddmparker> this would require some work at the library level to fully test it
[09:32:33] <toddmparker> just saying that's what we normally do if we care about old ie
[09:35:24] <jonathansampson> toddmparker: I understand; thank you for the response.
[09:35:34] <toddmparker> no problem
[09:36:01] <toddmparker> gseguin: think we do do our test deploy - uGoMobi, arschmitz, johnbender - any objections?
[09:36:55] <gseguin> toddmparker: just say the word
[09:37:22] <toddmparker> word.
[09:38:16] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I am trying to push those demos
[09:38:31] <uGoMobi> but have a git issue
[09:38:46] <uGoMobi> I worked in branch 1.3-stable
[09:38:48] <gseguin> what kind of issue?
[09:38:58] <uGoMobi> did git fetch origin 1.3-stable
[09:39:11] <gseguin> ok
[09:39:15] <uGoMobi> and then wanted to do git rebase origin/1.3-stable
[09:39:25] <uGoMobi> but that last thing doesn't work
[09:39:41] <uGoMobi> says current branch is up to date
[09:39:42] <gseguin> what was the error message?
[09:40:19] <uGoMobi> well I think I will do git pull (sorry for the merge commit)
[09:40:32] <toddmparker> something is up with 1.3-stable on view.
[09:40:40] <toddmparker> seems out of date
[09:40:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah I didn't see your changes to the homepage

[09:43:25] <toddmparker> It's ok 
[09:43:25] <uGoMobi> (i.e. they are the same)
[09:43:29] <uGoMobi> but will do for now
[09:44:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I only see a small margin change on the homepage, is that correct?
[09:45:00] <uGoMobi> oh wait, Chrome... had to refresh
[09:45:39] <toddmparker> intro text should be small on narrower screens
[09:45:51] <toddmparker> that's it

[11:38:30] <toddmparker> gseguin, johnbender - any idea why 1.3-stable branch preview is stale? 
[11:45:07] <johnbender> toddmparker: gseguin: do we need to tage to update it o.o
[11:45:10] <johnbender> *tag
[11:45:29] <johnbender> it makes sense that it only looks for new tags
[11:47:48] <uGoMobi> it was updated last night - no need for tags
[11:48:00] <uGoMobi> it's a branch preview
[11:49:10] <uGoMobi> no idea why it doesn't update anymore today
[11:50:35] <johnbender> uGoMobi: dunno then
[11:50:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I would ping gnarf

[11:54:07] <uGoMobi> anything we did wrong?
[11:54:09] <gnarf> what does it appear "stale"?
[11:54:51] <toddmparker> there are some changes i made to the homepage that aren't there
[11:54:56] <toddmparker> and some missing demos
[11:55:10] <gnarf> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3-stable/build.out.txt
[11:56:36] <toddmparker> not sure what's up
[11:56:49] <toddmparker> when i look at 1.3-stable locally, it has the changes
[11:57:31] <toddmparker> this file isn't there - http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3-stable/demos/examples/tables/reflow-refresh.php

[12:00:08] <uGoMobi> that reflow-refresh.php file was added today
[12:01:36] <toddmparker> right.

[12:06:16] <uGoMobi> I suggest we blame gseguin

[12:06:49] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:06:58] <gseguin> I wasn't even there
[12:07:24] <uGoMobi> that commit has your fingerprints all over it
[12:07:28] <gseguin> I don't go on the internets
[12:07:44] <gseguin> too dangerous of a place
[12:08:10] <gseguin> joke aside, do we have any idea what's going on?
[12:12:11] <gnarf> think i've found the bug in the view
[12:12:15] <gnarf> look right now?
[12:12:15] <uGoMobi> ah it's updated now
[12:12:22] <uGoMobi> gnarf: yeah
[12:12:25] <uGoMobi> nice!

[13:14:07] <uGoMobi> gseguin: does it check for coding standards?
[13:14:22] <uGoMobi> cause I see plenty of ' instead of "
[13:16:44] <gseguin> that doesn't trigger lints yet
[13:16:59] <gseguin> uGoMobi: just type: `grunt lint`
[13:18:54] <uGoMobi> ok I see them
[13:19:35] <uGoMobi> this isn't code that frequent added
[13:19:44] <uGoMobi> it was already in there
[13:21:50] <uGoMobi> ah wait... some vars have been wrapped in an if statement to add the refresh method I think
[13:23:36] <gseguin> there is that and some are not defined
[13:24:21] <uGoMobi> yup
[13:25:39] <gseguin> let me know when it's fixed I'll deploy

[14:00:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes it should
[14:00:56] <toddmparker> and the list of widgets in the left nag panel isn't there
[14:01:07] <toddmparker> nav
[14:01:14] <uGoMobi> are the files .php ?

[14:08:59] <uGoMobi> same problem in local build
[14:09:51] <uGoMobi> going to test if it's also a problem on master
[14:11:48] <gseguin> Wilto, get out of miketaylr_'s body!
[14:12:17] <uGoMobi> yup, also broken on master
[14:12:43] <toddmparker> DAMMIT GSEGUIN
[14:15:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm here what's up
[14:16:08] <uGoMobi> johnbender: there is a problem with the demo center in the zip file
[14:16:14] <uGoMobi> the nav includes
[14:16:23] <uGoMobi> aren't included
[14:17:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hmm
[14:17:11] <johnbender> gseguin: ping
[14:17:14] <Wilto> hm what
[14:17:16] <uGoMobi> you can see the problem if you do "grunt dist" local on branch master
[14:17:32] <uGoMobi> and then check out the generated zip
[14:17:47] <uGoMobi> hey Wilto 
[14:17:58] <uGoMobi> going to do a talk next week?
[14:18:04] <gseguin> what? 
[14:18:10] <gseguin> what did I do?
[14:21:37] <johnbender> gseguin: see uGoMobi's comments on the demo in the zip file
[14:21:43] <johnbender> gseguin: you replaced my bash hack right?
[14:22:55] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah yeah I know so now it's my problem...
[14:22:58] <gseguin> :)
[14:23:06] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I can't look at it right now
[14:23:11] <johnbender> gseguin: oh no, I don't mind taking a look I just wanted to double check with you
[14:23:30] <gseguin> johnbender: I got rid of all bash/shell things
[14:24:05] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'll take a quick look though I might have to drop off 
[14:24:39] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok thanks
[14:25:00] <toddmparker> once this is square, we can release on monday sometime
[14:25:01] <uGoMobi> we are going to release on monday
[14:25:10] <toddmparker> right, we have time
[14:25:20] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: will take a look at the blog post this weekend
[14:25:22] <toddmparker> releasing on friday afternoon is pointless
[14:25:25] <toddmparker> thanks!
[14:25:46] <gseguin> toddmparker: I agree it puts the beer o' clock in jeopardy 
[14:25:53] <gseguin> and that I can't take
[14:35:50] <johnbender> gseguin: uGoMobi: it just needs to take care of the includes with includes first

[14:43:49] <uGoMobi> johnbender: makes sense
[14:44:10] <uGoMobi> already thought it was a timing / order of doing things issue
[14:44:20] <uGoMobi> anything I can do?

[15:31:04] <toddmparker> Bye all!
[15:31:21] <gseguin> Have a good weekend toddmparker 
[15:36:38] <johnbender> gseguin: alright I have a working hack for the includes just need to figure out how to tell the firstpass to use the .html files from /dist/demos/ when the include is global-nav and search
[15:37:19] <johnbender> gseguin: how would I get at the files listed by one of the copy subtasks?
[15:37:57] * gseguin looks
[15:38:24] <johnbender> gseguin: can I access it under grunt.config?
[15:38:35] <gseguin> johnbender: yes
[15:38:44] <johnbender> gseguin: as dot properties?
[15:38:47] <gseguin> you can also refer to it in a template
[15:39:03] <gseguin> line 302
[15:44:12] <johnbender> gseguin: i'm confused is the temlate rendered in the context of grunt.config.<something> ?
[15:44:33] <gseguin> yes
[15:45:17] <johnbender> gseguin: grunt.config.copy is undefined

[17:46:49] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: temp fix is in
[17:47:01] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: you can give it a try but my basic check suggests it's woring
