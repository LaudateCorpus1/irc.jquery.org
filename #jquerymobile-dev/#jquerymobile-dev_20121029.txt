[00:55:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we are planning on combining the buttonMarkup function and the button widget in one widget
[00:56:01] <uGoMobi> see http://oksoclap.com/QrXzn7NyZY (line 26)
[01:10:19] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Thanks! That why the generated examples were not working ;-) ok, I'll do the others and leave this one till last maybe....
[01:10:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good morning
[01:11:02] <uGoMobi> do you have a link to that example?
[01:15:11] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Good morning :-) yes, here it is (beware it's a very long page, and take a while to load)
[01:15:24] <agcolom> http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/button/#option-corners
[01:15:36] <uGoMobi> loaded :)
[01:15:56] <agcolom> that was quicjk!
[01:17:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I understand it's a bit confusing... in current docs forms > button > options the code shows .buttonMarkup()
[01:17:41] <agcolom> so that 1st example with the "a" is added by hand so all fine. I've changed the button to buttonMarkup so the examples use that which is fine
[01:17:48] <uGoMobi> but those options should also work if you use .button()
[01:18:00] <agcolom> oh, really?
[01:18:16] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/button.js#L12
[01:18:34] <agcolom> do they work ?
[01:18:39] <uGoMobi> that are the options the button widget accepts
[01:19:55] <uGoMobi> the thing is.... the button widget calls the buttonMarkup function
[01:21:06] <uGoMobi> so actually the options you set for the button widget are used by the button widget when it calls the buttonMarkup function
[01:21:09] <agcolom> I've tried this, and button does not seem to work, while buttonMarkup does: http://jsfiddle.net/agcolom/K9bGr/12/
[01:25:38] <agcolom> uGoMobi: got to go to work :-( will try to catch you later about this.... (yes it is rather confusing ;-) )
[01:25:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, talk to you later
[01:26:26] <agcolom> I've only used the generated examples in the docs for corner and icon, to see what it was generating and I've left the hand-made ones to compare.
[01:26:34] <agcolom> uGoMobi: speak later...
[01:27:14] <uGoMobi> the problem is the initSelector... some buttons use buttonMarkup function only and some use the button widget (which calls the buttonarkup function)
[01:29:20] <uGoMobi> http://jsfiddle.net/K9bGr/13/
[01:31:47] <uGoMobi> the problem is that <button> elements are initialized automatic, they don't need data-role="button"
[01:33:27] <uGoMobi> so the call to the button widget plugin is made when the button is already enhanced and the options you set don't sort any effect anymore
[01:36:19] <uGoMobi> it works when you do that before they are auto initialized using "pagebeforecreate" event: http://jsfiddle.net/K9bGr/13/
[01:46:09] <uGoMobi> or when you configure default options: http://jsfiddle.net/K9bGr/13/
[02:27:51] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender I have observed the unit tests failing spontaneously with a timeout on my local machine - after many runs, mind you, but it did happen. Thus, I will continue tracking down the issue by firing console.logs from hopefully relevant places.
[02:27:51] <bot-t> (4 hours 25 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ have or have not?

[06:50:17] <kpepin_> Morning folks.
[06:51:35] <gseguin> mornin'
[06:52:12] <uGoMobi> morning kpepin_ and gseguin
[06:52:29] <kpepin_> Happy hurricane day to all of us on the east coast of the US.  :)
[06:52:48] <gseguin> yeah good luck with that
[06:53:04] <gseguin> hope you all stay dafe
[06:53:15] <gseguin> s/dafe/safe/
[06:53:50] <kpepin_> The place I work never closes, so I expect I'll be driving here tomorrow in the middle of it all.  :)
[06:55:20] <arschmitz_> Morning all
[06:55:34] <arschmitz_> im right on the coast in southern maine!
[06:57:52] <kpepin_> arschmitz:  I hear you guys are already losing power up there in some spots.
[06:59:05] <kpepin_> brb - reboot.
[07:02:51] <uGoMobi> gseguin _|Nix|_ JasonDScott Wilto : can you guys comment on the Basecamp post about cleaning up branches? Thanks
[07:02:54] <uGoMobi> https://filamentgroup.basecamphq.com/projects/8580955-jquery-mobile-team/posts/68835000/comments
[07:37:29] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: I finished up my first run at the workarounds extension
[07:38:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz_: cool!
[07:40:37] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: Seems like it should work well target everything to specific browser versions so we can eventually take things out without casuing any unseen regression on other stuff
[07:44:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz_: ok great
[07:45:09] <toddmparker__> morning
[07:45:26] <arschmitz_> Morning toddmparker__
[07:45:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz_: please remind me... are we planning on excluding position fixed for Android 2.3.x by default or make it optional?
[07:45:43] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker__
[07:45:47] <toddmparker__> hey uGoMobi
[07:45:55] <arschmitz_> neither
[07:46:02] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[07:46:13] <arschmitz_> its going to be supported by default
[07:46:32] <uGoMobi> right
[07:50:49] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: there wasa lot of talk about it but it came down to that the android 4 adoption rate is way to low with over 80% of people still on 2.3 and even a good chunk of new devices being sold are on it
[07:52:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz_: I know, but wasn't sure about if we want to make position fixed optional for Android 2.3.x and, if so, how
[07:55:59] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi and arschmitz_ - I think we agreed to add the hackiness for iOS5 and Android 2.x as an extension file to filed toolbars
[07:56:13] <toddmparker__> if that file is there, the toolbars work in those browsers
[07:56:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: ok clear
[07:56:41] <toddmparker__> we'd decide once built if we ship this as part of 1.3 or as an external thing, like the polyfilled fixed
[07:56:58] <toddmparker__> tho I am leanign towards shipping it in 1.3 and maybe stepping away from it by 1.4/5
[07:57:25] <toddmparker__> seems like people will freak if we drop support for those popular platforms
[07:57:36] <toddmparker__> as part of the core build
[07:57:48] <toddmparker__> but we can at least separate the ugliness from the core plugin
[07:57:58] <toddmparker__> hope people still like that idea
[07:58:09] <uGoMobi> yeah, so this sounds like a good approach
[08:02:02] <arschmitz_> toddmparker__: Yeah thats how i wrote the new one was as an extension like we talked about
[08:15:12] <toddmparker__> arschmitz_: perfect
[08:15:54] <toddmparker__> going thru a few of arschmitz_'s issue items
[08:16:04] <toddmparker__> uGoMobi: shoud dwe close? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2640#issuecomment-9817566
[08:17:45] <toddmparker__> A few others I wanted an opinion on:
[08:17:46] <toddmparker__> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4746#issuecomment-9818030
[08:23:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2640  yeah, we can close - he later added a note that the behaviour is intentional, not really sure what that "horrible" is about
[08:25:53] <toddmparker__> heh, ok
[08:25:57] <toddmparker__> want the honors?
[08:26:01] <toddmparker__> at 309 issues!
[08:26:08] <uGoMobi> sure, will close it
[08:26:10] <toddmparker__> bet we can get under 300 today
[08:26:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4746
[08:26:21] <arschmitz_> i think i have enough tagged for that
[08:26:56] <uGoMobi> that is typically a ticket that will stay open forever but he does have a point
[08:27:22] <uGoMobi> would be nice if there is a check to see if an element is already enhanced
[08:29:10] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: toddmparker: re 4746 if anything that would have to be a feature of the widget factory to if you attempt to call a method of something that has been initilized yet it will inililize it
[08:29:59] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: toddmparker: but as far as i know they dont have anything like that currently
[08:30:36] <uGoMobi> I suggest to get johnbender his opinion on this one
[08:31:25] <uGoMobi> I flagged it as feature request
[08:36:24] <uGoMobi> and commented

[08:54:28] <toddmparker__> thanks uGoMobi
[08:54:33] <toddmparker__> how about this one? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4520#issuecomment-9825359
[08:54:57] <toddmparker__> or this one
[08:54:58] <toddmparker__> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4662#issuecomment-9825271
[08:55:07] <toddmparker__> (trying to clear my inbox)
[08:58:06] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: what are typical use cases for same page transition?
[09:00:36] <uGoMobi> all I can think of is when you want to manipulate the content
[09:02:02] <uGoMobi> not sure if it is useful to make the framework scroll to last scroll position in that case
[09:11:31] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: I just commented and closed the other one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4662
[09:45:46] <agcolom> Wilto: how are things your end?
[09:46:08] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi again, I'm still at work.. all your links were pointing to the same jsfiddle?
[09:46:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi! owwww I think I forgot to update after changing :(
[09:47:44] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok... do you think you could send it to me again, if you don't mind? (then I'll hhave a better idea of what to do for the docs...)
[09:48:17] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I will send an email to you today or tomorrow to explain it
[09:48:24] <agcolom> ok, great, thanks!
[09:48:44] <agcolom> will travel home now...
[09:48:59] <agcolom> hope east coast people keep safe.
[09:49:22] <uGoMobi> yeah me too
[09:50:34] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: agcolom: its not bad on the coast in maine yet not sure about boston talked to ajpiano in NY and he said wasnt bad there yet either
[09:53:54] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I commeted on 4746
[09:53:55] <bot-t> (7 hours 26 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender I have observed the unit tests failing spontaneously with a timeout on my local machine - after many runs, mind you, but it did happen. Thus, I will continue tracking down the issue by firing console.logs from hopefully relevant places.
[09:54:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the joys of async test debugging :(
[09:54:42] <johnbender> event/timeout bindings are islands in a sea of uncertainty
[09:56:09] <uGoMobi> thank John "poet" Bender ;-)
[09:56:19] <uGoMobi> thanks*
[09:56:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: oh noes, what did I do in my comment
[09:57:01] <johnbender> uGoMobi: "comment"
[09:58:54] <uGoMobi> poet was more referring to  "event/timeout bindings are islands in a sea of uncertainty"
[09:58:58] <uGoMobi> :D
[09:59:34] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ah
[09:59:43] <johnbender> I had a nice discussion with a professor at USC about that very thing
[09:59:53] <uGoMobi> johnbender: your comment on that issue is clear
[09:59:54] <johnbender> most static analysis techniques fall down in the face of event bindings
[09:59:59] <johnbender> uGoMobi: cool
