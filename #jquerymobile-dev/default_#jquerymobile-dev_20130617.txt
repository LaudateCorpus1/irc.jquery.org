[08:03:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you around?
[08:27:30] <asheppard> uGoMobi: curious how the discussion re: css preprocessing for 1.4 ended up
[08:27:47] <asheppard> irc.jquery.org logs seem to stop at 5/14
[09:02:31] <arschmitz> asheppard: yeah thats being updated there have been some infrastructure changes
[09:02:54] <arschmitz> asheppard: but for 1.4 at least we will not be using a preprocessor maybe in the future though
[09:04:26] <asheppard> arschmitz: ok, thanks
[09:04:43] <asheppard> arschmitz: saw you simplified down to 2 themes
[09:05:01] <arschmitz> asheppard: not exactly
[09:05:08] <arschmitz> we only ever had 1 theme
[09:05:18] <arschmitz> however we changed how swatches work
[09:06:03] <arschmitz> and will probably ship with only 2 or 3 swatches in default theme vs 5
[09:06:43] <arschmitz> asheppard: because by default everything will map to a swatch now 
[09:10:26] <asheppard> arschmitz: is the idea that people will usually want to define custom swatches
[09:11:01] <arschmitz> its to encourage that as well but really its just a simplification of the themeing system 
[09:11:24] <arschmitz> we got a lot of feedback that people were confused by the default mapping and multiple swatches being required
[09:11:45] <arschmitz> it also makes it possible to do all theme inheritance with css instead of js
[09:13:12] <asheppard> arschmitz: i admit i wasn't sure how to differentiate c-d but i did like having e around
[09:13:33] <asheppard> arschmitz: css inheritance seems like a huge bonus
[09:13:39] <arschmitz> yes for sure
[09:13:48] <arschmitz> and you can still have as many swatches as you want
[09:14:32] <asheppard> curious if there has been any discussion regarding more "semantic" swatch names
[09:15:00] <arschmitz> semantic how ? they are not mapped to any particular functionality?
[09:15:26] <asheppard> e.g. "light" "dark" "bold" or something
[09:15:46] <asheppard> for example "e" for me always represents "action" or "alert"
[09:15:56] <arschmitz> that would not actually make sense because with custom swatches they can be anything you want
[09:16:35] <arschmitz> a could be red and b could be orange etc...
[09:17:51] <asheppard> i agree it would be hard to agree on a single meaning for everyone
[09:17:59] <asheppard> but say in my own projects
[09:18:14] <arschmitz> you could name a swatch anything you want in theory
[09:18:21] <asheppard> i'd set "data-theme='action'" and define the mapping somewhere
[09:18:38] <arschmitz> there is nothing stopping you from doing that
[09:18:48] <asheppard> hmm i'll try it out sometime
[09:19:03] <asheppard> i suppose it's all just css classes anyway
[09:19:13] <arschmitz> exactly
[09:19:24] <arschmitz> so if you change the names to be action instead of e
[09:19:41] <arschmitz> and then in your mark up used data-theme="action" it should work just fine
[09:19:59] <asheppard> makes sense
[09:20:37] <arschmitz> now iv never tried this but the only thing that would stop it is if we use a regex expecting a single letter swatch name some hwere
[09:20:44] <arschmitz> but pretty sure that is not the case
[09:21:16] <arschmitz> if you try it and it does not work please let me know and ill see what i can do to make sure it does
[09:21:22] <asheppard> yes, if i come across any issues i'll let you know
[09:21:24] <arschmitz> because i think this is a pretty valid use case
[09:26:25] <asheppard> for 1.4, next is the branch to keep an eye on?
[09:28:13] <arschmitz> nope actually we merged next into master last week 
[09:28:21] <asheppard> oh good to know
[09:29:20] <arschmitz> we had a full in person team meeting and conference all last week and got that in while we were there
[09:35:48] <asheppard> cool
[09:37:22] <arschmitz> asheppard: just a heads up this channel on irc will not be active any more very soon
[09:37:31] <arschmitz> we are combining with the ui team
[09:40:26] <asheppard> arschmitz: thanks for the heads up
[09:42:34] <asheppard> arschmitz: assuming codebases will remain separate for the foreseeable future?
[09:42:52] <asheppard> while working toward integration
[09:44:17] <arschmitz> yes 
[09:44:30] <arschmitz> this for now is just combining channels
[09:44:42] <arschmitz> kind of a first step towards integration
[10:12:38] <gseguin> aaannnd back!
[10:12:51] <arschmitz> hey gseguin
[10:12:59] <gseguin> how goes?
[10:13:06] <arschmitz> good
[10:13:10] <arschmitz> yourself
[10:13:46] <gseguin> good, recovered
[10:14:16] <arschmitz> thats good i pretty much took it easy yesterday to recuperate 
[10:15:42] <arschmitz> gseguin: well im off to lunch talk to you later
[10:16:03] <gseguin> sounds good, I'll mostly be lurking until July
[10:16:36] <arschmitz> yeah you had mentioned you were going to be pretty mia until fall 
[11:51:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: looks like there is a failure on your re-write of custom select at least one jquery version has failed on each build since the commit. Ill take a look tonight if i get a chance
[13:25:41] <agcolom_> Hi all! Any idea why I have now an '_' after my name?
[13:26:11] <toddmparker> hi agcolom_ 
[13:26:26] <toddmparker> maybe logged in two places? i have that all the time
[13:37:27] <agcolom_> Hi toddmparker ! 
[13:38:19] <agcolom_> Yes, this is strange, as I log in three places and each time I have managed to keep the same name... oh well, no big deal, but just surprised :-)
[13:38:50] <agcolom_> BTW the conf was really good! Ralph did a really good job for the mobile keynote
[13:39:29] <kborchers> agcolom_:  /nick agcolom
[13:39:47] <kborchers> :)
[13:39:58] <agcolom> Thank you kborchers :-)
[13:40:02] <kborchers> np
[13:40:33] <kborchers> just happens sometimes if server's get out of sync and it thinks you're logged in twice or if a login fails, etc.
[13:40:48] <agcolom> ok! Thanks!
