[06:45:54] <johnbender> gnarf: what can I do for you?
[07:25:16] <johnbender> gnarf: ping
[07:25:29] <johnbender> you had a question about the swarm.jquery.org cron job for nightlies?
[07:25:45] <johnbender> I actually don't know if that's still working I haven't been watching it :(
[07:26:06] <johnbender> rworth: what did you rename the jquerymobile website repo to again?
[07:26:56] <rworth> johnbender https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile-demos
[07:27:10] <johnbender> rworth: thanks!
[07:27:19] <johnbender> rworth: I know you told me when we talked but I didn't write it down :(
[07:27:39] <johnbender> gnarf: unless there's another cron job you're talking about
[07:28:31] <johnbender> let me know but I can easily get that moved over to jenkins, it's just a `make deploy_nightlies`
[07:28:35] <johnbender> or should be :/
[07:29:54] <johnbender> obviously that assumes that we've given Jenkins the keys (which we have)
[08:16:55] <gnarf> johnbender: its like a cron job that wget
[08:16:59] <gnarf> or curl
[08:17:14] <gnarf> johnbender: did you by chance put in that hosts entry in dns and try out the new site?
[08:23:13] <gnarf> johnbender: also - did you see my note on the infra issue re: proxying those two directories that were symlinks to builds?
[08:36:59] <johnbender> gnarf: I haven't touch the dns
[08:37:07] <johnbender> gnarf: nope, I didn't
[08:37:12] <johnbender> (see the email)
[08:37:16] <johnbender> I'll check it now
[08:37:29] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/issues/43#issuecomment-7139862
[08:37:29] <socialhapy> â˜… Github API: no issue found
[08:37:59] <gnarf> johnbender: see an email?
[08:38:54] <johnbender> gnarf: sorry, note
[08:41:45] <johnbender> gnarf: sorry, I'm confused what the state those two symlinks is?
[08:41:59] <johnbender> "symlinks"
[08:49:23] <gnarf> johnbender: well on the current server they symlink deep into the /var/lib/jenkins/jobs folder
[08:50:28] <gnarf> jqadmin@swarm-01:/srv/jquerymobile.com/htdocs$ ls -al branches test
[08:50:29] <gnarf> lrwxrwxrwx 1 root   root   69 Mar  6 14:18 branches -> /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/jQuery Mobile Branch Preview/workspace/branches
[08:50:29] <gnarf> lrwxrwxrwx 1 apache apache 68 Jan 30 15:10 test -> /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/jQuery Mobile Latest/workspace/compiled/demos/
[08:51:06] <gnarf> the new machine jquerymobile.com is moving to is not the same machine that runs jenkins
[08:51:18] <gnarf> so I'm going to proxy those directories to that machine
[08:54:01] <gnarf> also johnbender - whats "control.jquerymobile.com"
[08:54:18] <gnarf> i just noticed this lurking on that machine
[09:01:40] <johnbender> gnarf: no idea
[09:01:41] <johnbender> lol
[09:01:43] <johnbender> toddparker: ^^
[09:01:56] <gnarf> johnbender: if its a failed startup im just gonna kill it
[09:02:34] <johnbender> gnarf: as for the symlinks, that sounds like what I discussed with rworth
[09:02:49] <johnbender> gnarf: just to be clear that means you're going proxy it to the old swarm?
[09:02:59] <gnarf> johnbender: which is moving
[09:03:00] <gnarf> :)
[09:03:14] <gnarf> johnbender: currently on the new box it proxies to old swarm
[09:03:17] <johnbender> and when you say directories do you mean the urls or actually using something like nfs?
[09:03:19] <gnarf> but swarm also needs to move
[09:03:23] <johnbender> kk
[09:03:57] <gnarf> johnbender: I mean "ProxyPass /branches http://builder.jquerymobile.com/branches" and setting that IP in /etc/hosts to point to whichever machine is going to be running swarm
[09:04:09] <johnbender> kk
[09:04:20] <johnbender> gnarf: I'd like to leave the builds in jenkins
[09:04:24] <johnbender> so we know when it fails etc
[09:04:29] <gnarf> of course
[09:04:44] <gnarf> i don't really plan on changing anything, except which machine things are running on
[09:04:48] <johnbender> kk
[09:05:09] <johnbender> gnarf: so httpd will obviously be running on the new swarm as well
[09:05:17] <gnarf> johnbender: actually nginx, but yah
[09:06:12] <johnbender> gnarf: so just an entry in the nginx config. I don't know how php works in that case
[09:07:15] <gnarf> johnbender: php has its own server "php-fpm" which nginx connects to via socket
[09:07:33] <johnbender> gnarf: cool
[09:17:30] <gnarf> johnbender: do you think anyone is using control.jquerymobile.com ?
[09:18:44] <gnarf> it looks like it checks out themeroller?
[09:21:39] <gnarf> toddparker: ^ ?
[09:29:29] <gnarf> i guess i can just move it
[09:29:33] <gnarf> and when it complains about permissions
[09:29:37] <gnarf> someone will bitch to me
[09:29:42] <gnarf> seem fair johnbender? :)
[09:30:07] <gnarf> also johnbender - can you add your ssh keys to the infrastructure wiki?
[09:31:59] <gnarf> johnbender: see PM as well
[11:37:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The reason the map popup shows up wrong is because the width of the container is 0px.
[12:30:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/2ij00Q
[12:30:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup docs] Scaling code for map example: The width and height calculating during positioning must also be passed on to the style of the element "#map_canvas" inside the iframe - Gabriel Schulhof
[13:57:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I didn't see the issue on Chrome/Linux (weird), but glad you found out what was causing it
[13:59:02] <uGoMobi> gnarf johnbender : there are problems with http://jquerymobile.com/test/ the pages in subdirectories can't be visited anymore
[13:59:43] <gnarf> uGoMobi: hrm
[13:59:46] <gnarf> some seem to be working
[13:59:46] <gnarf> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/docs-lists.html
[14:00:36] <uGoMobi> gnarf: yeah, seems a bit random
[14:00:51] <uGoMobi> some return 404, others show a page with just "undefined"
[14:01:35] <gnarf> so these are errors on the old server too
[14:02:34] <uGoMobi> gnarf: all worked fine a couple of hours ago
[14:03:41] <gnarf> uGoMobi: http://builder.jquerymobile.com/test/
[14:03:45] <gnarf> there is is on the old server
[14:03:58] * uGoMobi is looking
[14:04:19] <gnarf> uGoMobi: those directories are proxied over there
[14:04:24] <uGoMobi> gnarf: hmm... see the same problem
[14:04:41] <gnarf> uGoMobi: kinda my point - I'm not sure what the problem is, but its not about having just moved as far as I can tell
[14:09:08] <gnarf> Right now the /test and /branches folders are using a ProxyPass to get to http://builder.jquerymobile.com/test & branches
[14:09:18] <gnarf> so they are serving whatever they are getting from the old server
[14:11:42] <gnarf> uGoMobi: not sure who knows more about /test
[14:12:57] <uGoMobi> gnarf: the server doesn't respond
[14:13:41] <gnarf> it seems swarm.jquery.org went down
[14:13:44] <gnarf> which is where that is
[14:13:57] <uGoMobi> right
[14:14:09] <uGoMobi> I see.... no Jenkins
[14:17:41] <gnarf> emailed (mt) about it
[14:17:58] <uGoMobi> gnarf: ok, thanks
[14:18:06] <gnarf> the /test issue is its own thing
[14:18:12] <gnarf> hopefully it should work on the new server
[14:18:16] <uGoMobi> gnarf: sorry, I don't know much about how this all is configured
[14:18:17] <gnarf> whenever I get everything running over there
[14:18:36] <gnarf> uGoMobi: sok, its all changing around right now anyway, last week has been chaos for me
[14:18:55] <uGoMobi> gnarf: yeah I noticed you have been pretty busy with this
[14:19:17] <uGoMobi> gnarf: don't let me hold you up :)
[14:19:39] <gnarf> i actually was just walking away from the cpu for a bit
[14:19:49] <gnarf> so, continuing that - ill be back later :)
[14:20:01] <uGoMobi> gnarf ok, later
[14:20:13] <uGoMobi> gnarf: thanks for the help
