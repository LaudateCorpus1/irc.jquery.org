[06:53:44] <DaveMethvin> gseguin: lemme know when you're around, i had some questions
[07:30:49] <Wilto> Yo yo yo.
[09:01:16] <gseguin> Good morning folks
[09:01:35] <gseguin> hey DaveMethvin
[09:01:43] <DaveMethvin> hey gseguin
[09:01:58] <DaveMethvin> so i had a question about that thing where it's tryna change the href
[09:02:24] <DaveMethvin> does mobile make a rule that users always have to attach their own events to document?
[09:02:28] <DaveMethvin> or can they do it elsewhere?
[09:02:31] * gseguin is not guilty of that
[09:03:05] <gseguin> I don't know of such a rule
[09:03:23] <DaveMethvin> the bug reported was that .live("click", ...) saw the href being wrong and these event handlers are trying to put it back before anyone sees it
[09:03:24] <DaveMethvin> right?
[09:03:40] <gseguin> right
[09:03:58] <DaveMethvin> but if the event was attached as .delegate("body", "click", ...) that woudl see the wrong value
[09:03:59] <gseguin> oh and the other thing I forgot to mention about that bug
[09:04:04] <DaveMethvin> it's only fixed when it gets to document
[09:04:24] <gseguin> is that it works on the browser with 1.7 because our handlers are simply not executed
[09:04:43] <DaveMethvin> huh?
[09:04:56] <gseguin> yup
[09:05:05] <gseguin> weird, huh?
[09:05:14] <DaveMethvin> but it was "fixed" in 1.7.1?
[09:05:36] * gseguin whips up an example
[09:08:00] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/tests/test_3686.html?jquery=1.6.4
[09:08:18] <gseguin> open the console and click on one of the links
[09:08:32] <gseguin> now do the same with 1.7.1
[09:10:19] <DaveMethvin> well whaddya know
[09:11:00] <DaveMethvin> actually gseguin i was working on running the mobile unit tests locally
[09:11:10] <DaveMethvin> getting some fails atm
[09:11:25] <DaveMethvin> is that normal?
[09:12:02] <gseguin> hmm.. nope, after I reverted that commit the build went back to green
[09:12:24] <DaveMethvin> just a sec i'll recheck
[09:13:55] <DaveMethvin> gseguin: if i run the tests locally with 1.7.1 (the default) I am getting several failures ... maybe testswarm is running a subset of all the tests?
[09:13:59] <DaveMethvin> this is on Chrome desktop
[09:14:14] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[09:14:30] <gseguin> we don't use testswarm yet
[09:15:02] <gseguin> we have our own Jenkins job running on a machine at Adobe
[09:15:15] <DaveMethvin> oh that's why it shows that crazy 10. address
[09:15:23] <gseguin> yup
[09:15:50] <DaveMethvin> the 1.7.1 fails i get are in event, which may explain why this case is breaking
[09:16:08] <DaveMethvin> it's showing a fail on "new events defined on the jQuery object"
[09:16:20] * gseguin tries it out
[09:16:39] <DaveMethvin> not sure why it would be showing success on jenkins tho
[09:16:53] <DaveMethvin> although i never trusted that jenkins guy if you want to know the truth
[09:17:53] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: we're not a test swarm
[09:18:09] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: are you running the aggregate tests at /test/unit/?
[09:18:19] <DaveMethvin> http://localhost/jquery-mobile/tests/unit/
[09:18:27] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: yah don't trust those
[09:18:28] <DaveMethvin> well, MY localhost, not yours
[09:18:37] <DaveMethvin> oh
[09:18:43] <johnbender> the tests fail in iframes for some reason
[09:18:56] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: that's exactly what I was going to suggest
[09:18:57] <johnbender> we have to address that before we move to test swarm
[09:19:07] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: run the navigation tests from the navigation url
[09:19:12] <johnbender> tests/unit/navigation/
[09:19:24] <gseguin> it passes indeed
[09:19:35] <DaveMethvin> should this work? http://localhost/jquery-mobile/tests/unit/event/
[09:19:43] <gseguin> yes
[09:19:49] <DaveMethvin> Setup failed on new events defined on the jquery object: Cannot read property 'pageContainer' of undefined
[09:19:55] <DaveMethvin> first test
[09:20:56] <DaveMethvin> same failure for http://localhost/jquery-mobile/tests/unit/event/?jquery=1.6.4
[09:21:00] <gseguin> hmm... http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/tests/unit/event/?jquery=1.7.1 ?
[09:23:11] <DaveMethvin> i don't get it
[09:23:24] <DaveMethvin> the tests i'm running are pulled from master
[09:23:42] <DaveMethvin> must be some sneak dependency that isnt' accounted for?
[09:24:26] <johnbender> Wilto: is todd back?
[09:24:34] <johnbender> or is he still on vacation/
[09:24:34] <johnbender> ?
[09:25:08] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: the url I sent you is master
[09:25:35] <DaveMethvin> gseguin: what do you use on the server side?
[09:25:43] <gseguin> apache2
[09:25:45] <DaveMethvin> i have a php server on apache
[09:25:55] <gseguin> same
[09:26:29] <gseguin> though for the tests I think most of them don't use php (they use RequireJS instead to validate our dependencies)
[09:26:52] <DaveMethvin> ok something is wrong with the tag writing i guess? 	<script src="../../../js/"></script>
[09:27:09] <johnbender> gseguin: we might have punted on that one
[09:27:11] <DaveMethvin> that's causing my error
[09:27:27] <johnbender> very odd
[09:27:30] <gseguin> johnbender: ?
[09:27:32] <johnbender> they are running fine locally
[09:27:54] <johnbender> gseguin: event doesn't use require
[09:28:04] <johnbender> I think we were running into issues and we punted on it
[09:28:05] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: that points to the index.php that concatenates the scripts
[09:28:13] <gseguin> johnbender: oh that's right
[09:28:23] <DaveMethvin> it's pointing to an html document for me
[09:28:45] <DaveMethvin> which Chrome can't digest as a script
[09:28:50] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: is your apache instance setup to have indices be both index.html and index.php ?
[09:28:58] <DaveMethvin> lemme check
[09:29:48] <DaveMethvin> gseguin: nope!
[09:29:56] <gseguin> heh :)
[09:30:04] <DaveMethvin> yeah, a bit subtle
[09:30:18] <gseguin> it's the default setting though
[09:30:43] <gseguin> or I think it is
[09:30:48] <DaveMethvin> not on mine :/
[09:30:59] <johnbender> gseguin: DaveMethvin: it's here that I'd like to point out that this is why we created Vagrant :D :D
[09:31:07] <DaveMethvin> lol
[09:31:34] <johnbender> I actually have a vagrant branch on my jqm fork if you want it :D :D <3
[09:31:42] <DaveMethvin> Dave Methvin, doing it The Hard way since 1995
[09:32:26] <DaveMethvin> well, would you look at that!
[09:32:57] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: wouldn't hurt to have that Vagrant fork up in the repo tho
[09:33:40] <johnbender> hell yah
[09:33:40] <johnbender> it werx
[09:33:40] * johnbender dances a little jig
[09:33:40] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: much fewer java issues on the CI since I switched it to a single executor
[09:33:41] * johnbender dances another little jig
[09:34:07] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: maybe, I don't think people care that much in the front end community :(
[09:34:19] <gseguin> johnbender: awesome!
[09:36:51] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: any idea why these handlers are not run with 1.7.1 ?
[09:37:40] <DaveMethvin> looking now to see what's up
[09:42:31] <Wilto> Hell yeah, johnbender.
[09:42:38] <Wilto> Also yeah, Todd is officially back on the job.
[09:43:23] <DaveMethvin> gseguin: your example is stopping propagation, so that's why it isn't making it up
[09:43:41] <gseguin> oh that's right!
[09:43:46] <DaveMethvin> the fact that it didn't stop propagation in 1.6.4 was a bug
[09:43:49] <gseguin> duh
[09:44:07] <gseguin> ok
[09:44:23] <johnbender> Wilto: cool cool
[09:44:32] <Wilto> brb; selling out on the internet
[09:45:46] <Wilto> Right, okay.
[09:49:15] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: I'm going to submit my category theory post/talk for jqcon sf
[09:49:34] <johnbender> I just did a late submission for fluent
[09:49:40] * johnbender would love to give that talk
[09:50:13] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: so back to square 1
[09:50:40] <gseguin> or we could wait for 1.7.2 and use the new run-first handlers
[09:50:56] <gseguin> and say that we support only 1.6.4 and 1.7.2
[09:51:14] <DaveMethvin> yep, although i think this needs some more thinking time
[09:51:43] <DaveMethvin> to maintain the charade for all user handlers, you need to hide it before they run and restore it afterwards
[09:51:55] <DaveMethvin> there is now a preDispatch and postDispatch hook to do that
[09:52:04] <DaveMethvin> but i shudder to think about what that does to performance
[09:52:15] <DaveMethvin> i guess this href diddling is absolutely needed?
[09:52:24] <DaveMethvin> to make the address bar go away?
[09:52:49] <gseguin> That would be a question for Scott
[09:54:36] <DaveMethvin> no matter what, the current code doesn't really work right for 1.6.4 either
[09:54:48] <DaveMethvin> since it only puts the href back once the event has bubbled to the document
[09:54:57] <DaveMethvin> and a lot of other handlers may have seen the bad href by then
[09:55:20] <DaveMethvin> so the pre/postDispatch handler can do that "right" if needed
[09:55:43] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: hmm we could test out the perf
[09:55:57] <gseguin> and these are available in 1.6.4 ?
[09:56:01] <johnbender> but it's on a user generated event so it shouldn't be too bad eh?
[09:56:03] <DaveMethvin> nope, only 1.7.2
[09:56:11] <johnbender> hmm
[09:56:13] <johnbender> nevermind then
[09:56:25] <johnbender> gseguin is right though, we could just support 1.7.2
[09:56:46] <DaveMethvin> but also, you'd need to hook it to some pretty common events, it looks like "click" being one of them
[09:56:46] <johnbender> 1.0.1 only supports 1.6.4 and we haven't released with the 1.7.1 dep
[09:57:06] <DaveMethvin> so each time a click occurs at every element we'll need to see if we are hiding the href and restore it, then hide it again
[09:57:22] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: we do parent checking on enhance
[09:57:32] <johnbender> this falls into the same category I would imagine
[09:57:57] <johnbender> as the event bubbles up
[09:58:02] <DaveMethvin> this would happen when the event was delivered, yeah
[10:12:10] <Wilto> johnbender, re jqcon: Hell yeah, dude.
[10:16:51] <Wilto> That’s all I have to contribute today, really.
[10:17:00] <Wilto> I can’t even dig my way out of my inbox.
[10:17:38] <johnbender> Wilto: brutal
[10:44:04] <Wilto> Yeah, I’m fightin’ a losing battle today.
[10:47:28] <johnbender> SWEET
[10:47:32] <johnbender> I'm going to throneofjs

[10:47:43] <johnbender> *OSCON
[10:49:30] <Wilto> Badass. SHOW NO MERCY
[10:50:19] <johnbender> I told them to invite Dave Kaneda
[10:50:23] <Wilto> Sweep the hell outta some legs.

[11:23:31] <johnbender> gseguin: does the guy just behind you run ubuntu?
[11:24:46] <gseguin> johnbender: yes
[11:25:02] <johnbender> gseguin: yah buddy
[11:25:15] <johnbender> tell him he should be using xmonad :P
[11:35:48] <DaveMethvin> you guys out of your meeting? gseguin?
[11:35:55] <DaveMethvin> i was in another meeting or i woulda crashed it
[11:35:58] <gseguin> nope still in it
[11:36:06] <gseguin> https://plus.google.com/hangouts/extras/talk.google.com/jquerymobile-meeting-20120308
[12:05:43] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin seriously though you should tell him to try out xmonad :D
[12:05:44] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[12:06:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/6PPUsg
[12:06:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] split list icons respect data-icon Fixes: #3747 - John Bender
[12:07:26] <Wilto> So, somebody chime in if I’m insane, here:
[12:07:51] <eddiemonge> you are insane
[12:07:59] <Wilto> I mean, yes. Exactly.
[12:08:30] <Wilto> I’ve got two branches waiting in the wings: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/3716-experiment and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/form-width-refactor
[12:08:45] <Wilto> I under _no_ circumstances want to sneak the latter into 1.1
[12:09:33] <Wilto> The former, however, I think we could sneak in. It primarily addresses a bug, like johnbender and I were discussing the other day.
[12:10:25] <Wilto> But it’s a change to buttonmarkup, and I s̶u̶c̶k̶ ̶a̶t̶ ̶m̶y̶ ̶j̶o̶b̶ want to be thorough, so if anyone’s around to put some eyes on this branch it would be awesome.
[12:11:23] <eddiemonge> why mention the latter then?
[12:12:02] <eddiemonge> !== undefined
[12:12:16] <eddiemonge> btnMarkup line 69
[12:12:30] <Wilto> It came about as a 1.1 issue, but it’s mo’ bigger than that.
[12:13:33] <eddiemonge> why are these undefined checks in there: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js#L18-25
[12:14:12] <eddiemonge> oh nevermind, i guess they can be false or 0
[12:14:25] <Wilto> Oh, those—yeah.
[12:14:57] <eddiemonge> ? eval var a = { hi: false, bye: true }; !!a.hi
[12:15:00] <bot-t> eddiemonge: false
[12:15:05] <eddiemonge> ? eval var a = { hi: false, bye: true }; !!a.bye
[12:15:06] <bot-t> eddiemonge: true
[12:15:14] <eddiemonge> ? eval var a = { hi: false, bye: true }; !!a.aloha
[12:15:15] <bot-t> eddiemonge: false
[12:17:57] <johnbender> ? eval var a = { foo: true, foo: false }; a.foo
[12:17:59] <bot-t> johnbender: false
[12:20:38] <eddiemonge> ? eval var a = { foo: true, foo: false }; a.foobar
[12:20:39] <bot-t> eddiemonge: undefined
[12:23:45] <eddiemonge> ? eval var a = { foo: true, foo: false }; a.foobar || a.foo || " johnbender "
[12:23:46] <bot-t> eddiemonge: " johnbender "
[12:35:15] <eddiemonge> can someone please explain https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js#L71-75 to me?
[12:35:32] <eddiemonge> looking at you Wilto
[12:35:39] <Wilto> what did I do
[12:35:49] <Wilto> Ah, yeah, that’s me.
[12:36:16] <eddiemonge> if true and false?
[12:36:50] <Wilto> If it has the “mini” attribute set to “true,” apply the appropriate class. The attribute is there and it’s explicitly set to false, apply the mo’ bigger class as an override. If not set at all, do nothing.
[12:37:11] <Wilto> Headers/footers apply “mini” styling by default.
[12:37:17] <Wilto> So there’s an explicit override.
[12:37:24] <Wilto> Same thing I’m doing with the “inline” deal.
[12:37:37] <eddiemonge> ?eval var o = false; o ? "1" : ";
[12:37:39] <bot-t> eddiemonge: SyntaxError: unterminated string literal
[12:37:50] <eddiemonge> ?eval var o = false; o ? "1" : "2"
[12:37:51] <bot-t> eddiemonge: "2"
[12:37:57] <eddiemonge> ?eval var o = "false"; o ? "1" : "2"
[12:37:58] <bot-t> eddiemonge: "1"
[12:38:07] <eddiemonge> so like that right?
[12:38:12] <Wilto> Yep.
[12:38:26] <eddiemonge> ?eval var o = "false"; o && o === false ? "1" : "2"
[12:38:28] <bot-t> eddiemonge: "2"
[12:38:47] <eddiemonge> can you provide an example of it getting to 1?
[12:39:16] <eddiemonge> im confused as to how it can be true while explicitly matching false
[12:40:04] <eddiemonge> im thinking maybe you might have want something like typeof o.mini !== undefined?
[12:41:52] <Wilto> It seems to grab the attribute’s value as actual true/false, not a string.
[12:42:08] <Wilto> But yeah, hm.
[12:42:19] <Wilto> …how is that working?
[12:43:25] <eddiemonge> its not?
[12:43:30] <Wilto> It is not.
[12:43:46] <eddiemonge> like i said, it cant/wont ever be true and false
[12:43:53] <eddiemonge> thats a universe ending paradox
[12:44:08] <eddiemonge> and without a paradox engine, unpossible
[12:44:12] <Wilto> ( o.mini != undefined && o.mini == false  )
[12:44:34] <Wilto> !==
[12:47:56] <eddiemonge> ?eval var a = {}; a.mini === false ? "Yup" : "Nope"
[12:47:57] <bot-t> eddiemonge: "Nope"
[12:48:12] <eddiemonge> ?eval var a = {mini: false}; a.mini === false ? "Yup" : "Nope"
[12:48:13] <bot-t> eddiemonge: "Yup"
[12:48:42] <eddiemonge> ?eval var a = {}; !a.mini ? "Yup" : "Nope"
[12:48:44] <bot-t> eddiemonge: "Yup"
[12:49:06] <eddiemonge> i think the explicit check for false was fine
[12:49:33] <eddiemonge> or actually, o.mini !== undefined && !o.mini would be better
[12:49:47] <eddiemonge> so it could take false, "false", or 0
[13:01:43] <Wilto> WHO USED A BRACELESS IF
[13:17:14] <eddiemonge> sorry 3773 is such a dirt pr
[13:17:20] <eddiemonge> i can redo it if needed
[13:20:47] <gseguin> what did I miss?
[13:20:48] <bot-t> (1 hour 15 mins ago) <johnbender> tell gseguin seriously though you should tell him to try out xmonad :D
[13:21:20] <gseguin> johnbender: I did, he said he wasn't interested
[13:21:28] <gseguin> I'll try it at home though
[13:21:50] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: I'm back
[13:22:02] <DaveMethvin> and better than ever gseguin
[13:22:14] <DaveMethvin> sooo
[13:22:20] <gseguin> heh :)
[13:22:32] <gseguin> so what tests were causing trouble?
[13:22:35] <DaveMethvin> would you mind stepping through some code and seeing if i am crazy?
[13:22:59] <DaveMethvin> i was running this test in Chrome locally: http://localhost/jquery-mobile/tests/unit/checkboxradio/?jquery=1.6.4
[13:23:04] <gseguin> not at all
[13:23:30] <DaveMethvin> put a breakpoint on jquery.mobile.widget.js in _getCreateOptions somewhere near the start
[13:23:52] <gseguin> are tests supposed to pass of fail?
[13:24:01] <gseguin> they all pass here
[13:24:06] <DaveMethvin> i think they pass in 1.6.4 yeah
[13:24:11] <gseguin> ok
[13:24:22] <DaveMethvin> but anyway leme know when you hit that breakpoint
[13:24:31] <gseguin> yup
[13:24:38] <DaveMethvin> ok, what is this.options?
[13:25:43] <johnbender> gseguin: pfft, he's not hardcore
[13:25:46] <johnbender> :D
[13:25:53] <DaveMethvin> for me it was undefined
[13:25:57] <DaveMethvin> hope i didn't spoil it
[13:27:54] <gseguin> sorry, had to help a peer
[13:27:59] <gseguin> running tests now
[13:28:39] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: at the first stop in _getCreateOptions ?
[13:28:47] <gseguin> this.options is not undefined for me
[13:28:52] <DaveMethvin> oh...
[13:28:58] <DaveMethvin> what is it?
[13:29:08] <gseguin> Object
[13:29:08] <gseguin> disabled: false
[13:29:08] <gseguin> domCache: false
[13:29:08] <gseguin> keepNative: "input.should-be-native"
[13:29:08] <gseguin> keepNativeDefault: ":jqmData(role='none'), :jqmData(role='nojs')"
[13:29:09] <gseguin> theme: "c"
[13:29:09] <gseguin> __proto__: Object
[13:29:21] <DaveMethvin> thats a fine looking set of options
[13:29:29] <DaveMethvin> what version of chrome are you using?
[13:29:59] <DaveMethvin> chrome 17 for me
[13:30:13] <DaveMethvin> let me check firefox
[13:31:38] <gseguin> chrome 17
[13:31:52] <gseguin> 17.0.963.78
[13:32:30] <DaveMethvin> holy crap, i can't trust Chrome
[13:32:39] <DaveMethvin> looks fine in firefox
[13:33:51] <DaveMethvin> well this brings my entire developer world view into question
[13:34:07] <DaveMethvin> if i can't trust `this` what can i trust?
[13:34:15] <gseguin> I don't know you but that happens to me at least once a day
[13:34:36] <gseguin> s/that/this/
[13:34:44] <DaveMethvin> and since i often say `var self = this` does that mean i cannot trust my self?
[13:34:47] <gseguin> but what is this?
[13:35:41] <DaveMethvin> ok now i need to go back and reverify what i already found
[13:36:24] <DaveMethvin> there are still some regressions when i stick 1.7.2pre in there but not a lot
[13:37:01] <gseguin> oh yeah I see that
[13:37:14] <gseguin> just tried that test with jquery=git
[13:37:30] <gseguin> ouch
[13:45:50] <eddiemonge> anyone want to review three pull requests from me?
[13:46:02] <gseguin> eddiemonge: I'll look at them
[13:46:38] <eddiemonge> super easy one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3772
[13:46:39] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (1h, 19m ago): missing semi-colon

[13:47:33] <eddiemonge> medium one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3774/files
[13:47:34] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (19m, 42s ago): DRY up buttonMarkup a bit and save a variable in the process
[13:47:46] <eddiemonge> i feel ashamed one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3773/files
[13:47:47] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (46m, 59s ago): ButtonMarkup Cleanup
[13:56:46] <gseguin> eddiemonge: why didn't you use a switch ?
[13:56:52] <gseguin> in 3774
[13:56:54] <eddiemonge> if else is faster
[13:58:22] <eddiemonge> by a lot sometimes: http://jsperf.com/switch-vs-if-else
[13:59:11] <gseguin> ok
[14:00:42] <eddiemonge> usually
[14:00:44] <eddiemonge> sometimes
[14:00:48] <eddiemonge> depending on the moon
[14:00:55] <eddiemonge> and Wilto's current mood
[14:01:27] <gseguin> heh
[14:07:12] <eddiemonge> that if else is one part of the style guidelines i never liked. when quickly glancing down a page, it looks like an extra curly brace
[14:09:49] <Wilto> Current Mood: http://wil.to/_/hulkbear.gif
[14:12:12] <eddiemonge> gseguin: updated them
[14:12:29] <gseguin> eddiemonge: thanks
[14:12:36] <Wilto> Constant mood, really.
[14:14:18] <Wilto> johnbender: I can’t believe you didn’t call me out for Twitterquoting you.
[14:14:38] <gseguin> eddiemonge: another thing is you may consider caching event.type into a local var
[14:16:25] <eddiemonge> to save more characters because thats not really a performance difference?
[14:17:17] <gseguin> there is a very slight one I believe
[14:21:17] <eddiemonge> 1% difference. enough for me
[14:22:04] <gseguin> I can't find the jsperf to verify it but I seem to remember reading this in Zakas' "high performance javasscript"
[14:25:39] <eddiemonge> http://jsperf.com/cache-obj-lookup
[14:25:40] <eddiemonge> updated
[14:26:30] <gseguin> that was fast, thanks
[14:27:15] <eddiemonge> which was?

[14:47:47] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (1h, 46m ago): ButtonMarkup Cleanup
[14:48:02] <Wilto> Oh, gseguin pulled that in, yeah?
[14:48:10] <eddiemonge> no, not yet
[14:48:21] <eddiemonge> but wont be able to if you merge that branch in
[14:48:24] <eddiemonge> but its fine
[14:48:34] <eddiemonge> ill re-write the pr
[14:49:05] <eddiemonge> did you see what i did with the o.mini in it?
[14:49:46] <Wilto> Yeah. Maybe I should pull this PR into the branch?
[14:50:08] <eddiemonge> it wont go cleanly
[14:50:24] <Wilto> Maybe if I intimidate it enough.
[14:50:36] <Wilto> Threaten the branch with violence, I’m saying.
[14:50:56] <eddiemonge> if you want to try i say go for it, but im not sure if gseguin reviewed it. you can review it as you are terrorizing it
