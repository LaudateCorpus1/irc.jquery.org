[06:04:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I had another look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4488 and think it's better to ask johnbender or gseguin first
[06:04:11] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4488 on jquery-mobile (pawl; 1w, 6d ago): submit requires delegate 'pageshow'
[07:32:56] * uGoMobi agcolom: the docs html files still try to load themeswitcher.js experiment which is no longer included as from 1.1 so it results in 404's
[07:33:38] <uGoMobi> agcolom: this has to be removed from all doc files on master and 1.1-stable
[07:34:30] <uGoMobi> I can do this en masse, but will wait until you are finished reviewing MauriceG his PR's
[07:35:16] <uGoMobi> MauriceGo: ^^^
[07:53:21] <MauriceGo> Hi uGoMobi: Yes, better to make a bulk collect for it.
[08:06:07] <uGoMobi> MauriceGo: do you have more PR's in queue?
[08:08:23] <MauriceGo> uGoMobi: No, not now. I'm busy on another side.
[08:10:03] <uGoMobi> MauriceGo: ok, then I'll wait till agcolom has reviewed your current PR's and then make the change in the head section of all files
[08:10:43] <uGoMobi> if I do it now she get conflicts when merging your PR's
[08:11:33] <MauriceGo> Yes, I can imagine
[08:45:00] <agcolom> Hi, I'm on my way back. I'll be able to review Maurice's PRs this evening...
[08:46:56] <MauriceGo> Hi agcolom: :-)   Thanks!
[08:48:05] <agcolom> I'm on the train! Hi Maurice :-)
[08:49:27] <agcolom> Will lose signal now... Catch you all later...
[09:00:00] <jzaefferer> hey toddparker, is Anne usually in here?
[09:06:40] <agcolom> Hi jzaefferer, I'm Anne, but I'm not sure I'm the one you're looking for..??
[09:06:54] <jzaefferer> hey agcolom
[09:06:59] <jzaefferer> are you working on the api docs?
[09:07:02] <agcolom> Hey !
[09:07:05] <agcolom> yes, that's me!
[09:07:08] <jzaefferer> cool :-)
[09:07:14] <jzaefferer> Did you see my jquery-devs-team email?
[09:07:19] <agcolom> yes
[09:07:47] <jzaefferer> okay, good to know that channel is wokring
[09:07:50] <jzaefferer> *working
[09:08:11] <jzaefferer> Let me know if you run into any issues with those updates
[09:08:50] <agcolom> ok, I'll be checking this evening. I had some problems at the weekend, and Richard gave me some instructions...
[09:09:22] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'll respond to that in addtion to what Todd said
[09:10:28] <agcolom> jzaefferer: I'm just back from work now... then pick up kids from school, cook dinner, and then I'll have to merge some JQM PRs and then I'll try to deploy again to api docs.
[09:11:20] <agcolom> probably in about 3h or so...
[09:12:07] <agcolom> jzaefferer: oh yes, I've just received your email now! (Only just turned the computer on)
[09:12:42] <jzaefferer> ha, okay
[09:12:50] <uGoMobi> johnbender: what are you referring too? I think I missed something
[09:13:30] <uGoMobi> to*
[09:17:11] <agcolom> jzaefferer: sorry couldn't resist to try! All working fine! just the data in incomplete as I was half-way through adding things... but all working great !!!
[09:18:05] <jzaefferer> agcolom: okay, so you were able to merge your changes?
[09:18:23] <agcolom> ah sorry I've not done that yet. I've just done a grunt deploy
[09:18:47] <jzaefferer> okay
[09:18:47] <agcolom> (git pull, npm install, grunt deploy)
[09:19:03] <jzaefferer> well, I didn't change any content, so there really shouldn't be any merge conflicts
[09:19:14] <agcolom> do you want me to try to do a git push?
[09:20:18] <agcolom> (my only changes are in the entries folder)
[09:20:48] <jzaefferer> whenever you're ready with those changes
[09:20:52] <agcolom> ok....
[09:20:59] <agcolom> this evening then...
[09:44:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4555
[09:44:11] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4555 on jquery-mobile (jonwinterburn; 1h, 22m ago): highlight buttons and listview items (ui-btn-active) on/live tap
[09:44:49] <johnbender> uGoMobi: is that related to the delay we introduce to prevent highlighting on scroll?
[09:45:18] <johnbender> also, we can't use tap on elements that will move
[09:45:38] <johnbender> because the subsequent click will fire on a random element
[09:45:54] <uGoMobi> johnbender: no I don't think this has to do with the delay
[09:47:05] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I think it's related to this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4469
[09:47:06] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4469 on jquery-mobile (janimattiellonen; 2w, 6d ago): No visual feedback given when pressing a button/stylished link
[09:47:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hmm, yah on a reread it doesn't touhc either of htose isseues
[09:47:54] <johnbender> uGoMobi: well that is directly related to the hoverDelay
[09:48:06] <johnbender> that hover delay is in there to prevent the highlighted state on scroll
[09:48:37] <uGoMobi> toddparker already suggested the other to make changes so buttons always get active state, no matter if there is a href or not
[09:49:25] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes, i know... but I think the issue here is that there is no href
[09:49:44] <johnbender> so it doesn't get it either way
[09:49:58] <uGoMobi> yup, no active class added
[09:50:06] <uGoMobi> even with hoverDelay set to 0
[09:50:10] <johnbender> ok
[09:50:21] <johnbender> the second issue seems to have been solved by the hoverDelay
[09:50:24] <johnbender> so they are different?
[09:52:07] <uGoMobi> that second issue is about both hoverDelay and buttons not getting active state when href="#" is used
[09:54:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ok, a full reading makes that clear
[09:54:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'll go back to doing something productive instead of pestering you :D
[09:54:21] <uGoMobi> johnbender: if i m not mistaken buttons don't get active state when they don't have a href or when it only contains a hash
[09:54:30] <johnbender> uGoMobi: looks lik
[09:54:33] <johnbender> that's very odd
[09:54:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: lol
[09:54:43] <uGoMobi> it is by design
[09:54:48] <johnbender> orly?
[09:55:05] <uGoMobi> i think i saw a exception in the code that checks if href is a hash only
[09:57:08] <uGoMobi> johnbender: if ( path.parseUrl( link.getAttribute( "href" ) || "#" ).hash !== "#" ) {
[09:58:32] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I guess that makes sense
[09:58:41] <johnbender> # is supposed to represent a no-op
[09:58:56] <johnbender> in terms of navigation at least
[09:59:25] <johnbender> the assumption is that buttons made with links are meant for navigation
[10:00:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'll leave that up to you and toddparker :D
[10:01:16] <uGoMobi> johnbender: thanks :(
[10:01:21] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:01:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it's just a decision of behavior right?
[10:01:33] <johnbender> maybe I missed something
[10:02:00] <uGoMobi> yes, it is just about when a button should get active state
[10:02:17] <uGoMobi> to give more visual feedback
[10:02:23] <johnbender> cool
[10:02:32] <johnbender> happy to help if you guys need it
[10:02:38] <uGoMobi> i think i just delete that whole line ;-)
[10:02:48] <uGoMobi> no more if... always active state :D
[10:03:04] * uGoMobi asking you to help might be a better option
[10:03:30] <uGoMobi> but we will look into it later
[10:03:38] <johnbender> that seems reasonable I'm just wondering what the corner cases are
[10:03:40] <johnbender> kk
[10:03:41] <johnbender> cool
[10:28:36] <johnbender> scottjehl: are you around?

[13:47:08] <agcolom> uGoMobi, I am done now
[13:47:13] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[13:47:16] <uGoMobi> oh ok :-)
[13:47:32] <agcolom> I just had a question for mini sliders
[13:47:38] <uGoMobi> ask
[13:47:55] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/slider/
[13:48:17] <agcolom> the docs say This will produce an input that is not as tall as the standard version and has a smaller text size.
[13:48:28] <agcolom> but the input is the same size and so is the text!
[13:48:52] <agcolom> Is this normal? (the slider though is mini, but not the input or the text)
[13:50:09] <uGoMobi> i see what you mean
[13:50:35] <uGoMobi> there is a little issue with slider input
[13:50:58] <uGoMobi> it triggers the textinput widget
[13:51:04] <agcolom> That's what happens when I write the api docs ;-)
[13:51:19] <uGoMobi> so the classes of input text fields are added to the slider input as well
[13:52:14] <uGoMobi> i will make a change in the css as temporary fix
[13:53:06] <agcolom> ok, no rush.... I'm surprised noone has mentioned it before...
[13:53:36] <agcolom> jzaefferer: I did upload my changes to github and all is working well :-)
[13:53:37] <uGoMobi> actually i dont think the mini slider is very popular
[13:53:49] <agcolom> yes, probably :-)
[13:53:49] <uGoMobi> but i might be wrong ;-)
[13:55:24] <agcolom> ok, I'm off now... I am dead! Not advisable to do more in this state!
[13:55:29] <agcolom> Goodnight :-)

[15:27:42] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I suppose that is an issue for Core?
[15:28:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: certainly appears that way
[15:28:28] <johnbender> the line looks legit though
[15:28:35] <johnbender> so it might actually be an issue for opera
[15:28:38] <johnbender> miketaylr: you around?
