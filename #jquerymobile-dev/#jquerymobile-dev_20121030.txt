[05:01:02] <arschmitz> Morning all
[05:06:20] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz
[05:06:43] <uGoMobi> everything ok?
[05:06:50] <arschmitz> is here
[05:07:10] <uGoMobi> any damage from Sandy?
[05:07:10] <arschmitz> couple trees tried to fall on my house but were caught by another tree
[05:07:24] <uGoMobi> pfew
[05:07:38] <arschmitz> which was lucky one of them would have broke the window i sleep right against basicly
[05:08:23] <uGoMobi> were you able to sleep at all?
[05:08:49] <arschmitz> oh yeah
[05:09:13] <arschmitz> i can sleep through anything lol
[05:09:20] <uGoMobi> :)
[05:09:42] <uGoMobi> BTW - open issues count: 299
[05:09:45] <uGoMobi> whoeha
[05:09:48] <arschmitz> never lost power at my house which is good the office did but it was back this morning
[05:09:52] <arschmitz> NICE!
[05:10:05] <arschmitz> i spent most of last night investigating a CRAZY bug
[05:10:11] <arschmitz> i think you have looked at it
[05:10:18] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw on the news many households don't have power
[05:10:31] <uGoMobi> which issue?
[05:10:47] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4250
[05:11:14] <uGoMobi> oh yeah I looked at that one during the summit
[05:11:17] <arschmitz> this is WAY crazier then it looks like
[05:11:44] <arschmitz> i was able to reproduce the problem every time
[05:11:52] <uGoMobi> I was hoping your bottom 0 solution would fix that one
[05:11:59] <uGoMobi> yeah me too
[05:12:12] <arschmitz> no its way weirder listen to this
[05:12:19] <uGoMobi> we had a similar issue with Chrome on ICS
[05:12:31] <uGoMobi> that one was solved by removing overflow hidden
[05:12:38] <arschmitz> going to the albums page on the persistant footers in docs
[05:12:56] <arschmitz> on an actual 2.3 device i can NEVER go to the friends page
[05:12:57] <uGoMobi> I couldn't find any CSS property/value so far that fixes 4250
[05:13:12] <arschmitz> it toggles active but a click never fires
[05:13:24] <uGoMobi> I thought it only happens if I scroll the page a bit
[05:13:33] <uGoMobi> tested on HTC Incredible
[05:13:34] <arschmitz> scrolling the page fixes it for me
[05:13:39] <uGoMobi> huh
[05:13:41] <arschmitz> if i scroll at all it works fine
[05:13:44] <uGoMobi> :/
[05:13:50] <uGoMobi> madness
[05:13:58] <arschmitz> but its only going from albums to friends
[05:14:05] <arschmitz> any other combo works perfect
[05:14:28] <arschmitz> and removing the fixed toolbar on friends and making it static makes everything work fine
[05:14:42] <arschmitz> also removing the pictures from the list on albums makes it work fine
[05:15:20] <uGoMobi> how about removing the filter from "friends"
[05:15:39] <arschmitz> or removing all the button markup in the footer and just making them spans make them work
[05:16:10] <arschmitz> didnt try that ill try it now
[05:16:23] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:17:05] <uGoMobi> I was planning on making a test page with empty pages, see if it works and then adding content step by step
[05:17:11] <uGoMobi> until it breaks :)
[05:17:30] <arschmitz> i even tried re arranging pages removing the data-prefetch making them non persistant none of it makes a difference
[05:17:57] <arschmitz> there seems to be several differnet things at play though since i can fix it 3 different completely unrelated ways
[05:18:33] <arschmitz> i was looking into it last night hoping you were right that the bottom0 solution would work
[05:18:46] <uGoMobi> but no dice :(
[05:18:57] <arschmitz> also tried just buttons in footer no navbar
[05:20:18] <uGoMobi> I think the best thing to start with is two pages with enough text to force scroll, no fixed header, only persistent footer with navbar
[05:21:14] <uGoMobi> we also shouldn't test this on JS Bin
[05:21:14] <arschmitz> yeah navbar dosent "Seem" to be related to it neither does persistant adding or removing them makes no difference
[05:21:26] <arschmitz> sould or should"
[05:21:35] <arschmitz> souldnt?
[05:21:49] <arschmitz> ha i cant type this morning
[05:21:54] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:22:34] <uGoMobi> JS Bin add a position fixed element to the page (edit in JS Bin) which could cause issues
[05:22:48] <arschmitz> ahh yeah good point
[05:23:18] <arschmitz> yeah i havent been using js bin im actually modifing the docs and and pushing it to my server to test on an actual android
[05:23:26] <uGoMobi> I couldn't reach the IP of my notebook on the dev summit so I couldn't test local
[05:23:46] <uGoMobi> yeah that's the way to go
[05:23:49] <arschmitz> i cant ever they dont allow port forwarding at my office
[05:23:57] <arschmitz> so i always push to server
[05:25:01] <uGoMobi> I didn't need to forward ports
[05:25:08] <arschmitz> cool
[05:25:17] <arschmitz> im behind a big corperate firwall here though
[05:25:48] <uGoMobi> you need static IP's and be able to reach other IP's in same network
[05:26:31] <uGoMobi> yeah I can imagine corporate security settings don't allow this
[05:26:31] <arschmitz> yeah thats the other problem we have 2 networks a public one with dynamic and a private static one
[05:26:39] <uGoMobi> i see
[05:26:51] <arschmitz> and the phone is only allowed on the public dynamic range
[05:27:01] <arschmitz> and my pc is on the static private one
[05:27:11] <uGoMobi> trouble
[05:27:16] <uGoMobi> anyway... heading to the Apple store
[05:27:18] <arschmitz> so i would need portforwarding from a public ip
[05:27:23] <arschmitz> cool
[05:27:30] <uGoMobi> see if they have any new new iPads in stock
[05:27:32] <arschmitz> going to pick yourself up something good?
[05:27:36] <arschmitz> nice
[05:27:55] <arschmitz> i have an ipad2 and havent seen the need to upgrade yet
[05:28:35] <uGoMobi> I don't have any iDevice anymore at the moment so that sucks
[05:28:52] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:28:58] <arschmitz> espically doing bugs
[05:29:21] <arschmitz> im lucky have lots of idevices avalible
[05:29:57] <uGoMobi> cool
[05:30:09] <uGoMobi> I probably need an iPod or iPhone too
[05:30:15] <uGoMobi> but can't buy all ;-)
[05:30:25] <arschmitz> yeah stuff gets expensive fast
[05:30:36] <uGoMobi> have to think about that
[05:30:55] <arschmitz> i still have an iphone 4
[05:31:22] <uGoMobi> browserstack is very useful but you do need some devices to test properly
[05:31:43] <arschmitz> yeah iv been working on getting some
[05:31:45] <uGoMobi> ok I am out... talk to you later
[05:31:50] <arschmitz> i have browser stack too though
[05:31:51] <arschmitz> later
[06:59:52] <gseguin> Good morning all
[07:00:05] <gseguin> Hope the east coasters are sound and safe
[07:00:34] <gseguin> uGoMobi: Thanks for the update on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3208, I have made no progress at all on it
[07:00:58] <gseguin> It's a really tricky one and I have no clue how to tackle it
[07:03:30] <kpepin> Morning folks.  Hope everyone survived the urricane ok.
[07:05:31] <gseguin> hey kpepin
[07:05:40] <gseguin> how's everything on your side?
[07:07:48] <uGoMobi> morning
[07:08:39] <uGoMobi> yeah that one input issue is crazy
[07:10:09] <kpepin> Doing good.  No power outages, no flooding.  No sharks in the front yard.  Can't complain.
[07:17:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: get yourself an ipad?
[07:17:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no they didn't have the new one yet :(
[07:17:53] <arschmitz> bummer
[07:18:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you still cant get iphone 5's around here
[07:18:47] <uGoMobi> in the Dutch online apple store they only show the new one but in the apple store here in amsterdam even the demo iPad are the previous one
[07:19:00] <arschmitz> lame
[07:19:38] <uGoMobi> have to wait until friday to get the new one
[07:19:53] <arschmitz> so on 4250 you were right that removing the filter on firends fixes also
[07:20:26] <uGoMobi> yeah didn't expect that because apple was saying they immediately stop selling the iPad 3 with A5 processor
[07:20:40] <uGoMobi> hehe
[07:20:58] <uGoMobi> the filter has overflow hidden
[07:21:09] <arschmitz> yeah execpt
[07:21:19] <arschmitz> i removed data-prefetch
[07:21:26] <arschmitz> and reloaded on albums
[07:21:34] <uGoMobi> that seems to causing trouble too just when there is also position fixed on the page
[07:21:55] <arschmitz> and still wont fire a click yet removing a filter on another unloaded page fixes???????
[07:22:15] <uGoMobi> seriously?
[07:22:19] <arschmitz> YES!
[07:22:23] <arschmitz> also
[07:22:25] <uGoMobi> bizarre
[07:22:33] <arschmitz> using landscape fixes it
[07:22:39] <arschmitz> and i dont mean changing orientation
[07:22:45] <arschmitz> just using the phone in landscape
[07:23:17] <arschmitz> i have absolutely no way to explain the results im getting
[07:24:07] <arschmitz> i dont see how changing something on another page thats not even loaded could fix the problem with a click no fireing??????
[07:26:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: still testing with the docs persistent toolbars example?
[07:26:38] <arschmitz> yes
[07:26:47] <uGoMobi> the other pages are prefetched
[07:27:02] <arschmitz> yeah i removed data-prefetch
[07:27:10] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[07:27:30] <arschmitz> im so very lost
[07:27:47] <arschmitz> i think im going to start over and write down everything step by step
[07:27:52] <arschmitz> re check everything
[07:28:05] <arschmitz> because i dont see how its possible
[07:31:00] <arschmitz>  uGoMobi: i must have missed something or maybe accidently forgot to refresh or something logic tells me thats just not possible!
[07:32:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it can't have to do with a page that isn't loaded at all, that's for sure :)
[07:32:44] <arschmitz> exactly!
[07:34:01] <mspisars> is there a date set for 1.2.1?
[07:37:15] <uGoMobi> mspisars: no
[07:41:39] <mspisars> is there a timeframe? ballpark?
[07:42:39] <uGoMobi> mspisars: not really
[07:43:17] <uGoMobi> mspisars: we want to do anoher maintenance release for 1.1 first... 1.1.2
[07:43:41] <uGoMobi> and probably 1.2.1 in a few weeks
[07:44:37] <uGoMobi> we are planning on releasing 1.3 in Q4
[07:45:18] <uGoMobi> so it won't be too long before we release 1.2.1 I suppose
[07:46:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker__: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5237 +1
[07:46:54] <toddmparker> good morning!
[07:47:02] <toddmparker> at 300 issues - awesome work
[07:47:10] <uGoMobi> morning
[07:47:15] <toddmparker> must…close…one…more
[07:47:17] <uGoMobi> no hurricane damage?
[07:47:20] <toddmparker> even if it's legit
[07:47:22] <arschmitz> DOH we were under 300 twice today!
[07:47:26] <toddmparker> not really. lost some gutters
[07:47:29] <toddmparker> no biggie
[07:47:36] <uGoMobi> ok good
[07:47:37] <arschmitz> new issues getting us
[07:47:41] <toddmparker> guess we need to get well below 300
[07:47:49] <toddmparker> New York got itbad
[07:47:56] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw that
[07:49:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker: maine wasent bad either just some down tress and stuff (though one was only stopped from busting through my bedroom window by another tree the aught it)
[07:53:26] <toddmparker> yikes!
[07:53:37] <toddmparker> where are you in Maine?
[07:54:53] <arschmitz> portland
[07:55:14] <arschmitz> office is in westbrook office lost power but the house didnt
[08:12:27] <toddmparker> I love Portland. Duck Fat.
[08:15:47] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! Glad to see people from the East Coast at their respective keyboards.
[08:22:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah Duck Fat is good!
[08:24:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so re-testing 4250 things are starting to make a bit more sense.
[08:27:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that sounds promising
[08:27:47] <arschmitz> much more so then before
[08:28:28] <arschmitz> i can now make it work by removing just the picutre under the the offending button
[08:30:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the thumb is positioned absolute, right?
[08:30:24] <arschmitz> yup
[08:30:36] <arschmitz> also removing the filter on the list fixes
[08:31:09] <arschmitz> or just making the list shorter fixes (because there is no more image underneath
[08:31:28] <arschmitz> its strange though its only the friends button which dosent even over lap the image
[08:31:39] <uGoMobi> but the issue also occured on pages that don't have a list with thumbs
[08:31:48] <arschmitz> the info one which over laps completely works fine
[08:32:40] <arschmitz> see i can only make it happen going from albums to friends
[08:33:08] <arschmitz> any other combo of the pages works fine and thats the only thing mentioned in the issue is clicking around those 4 pages
[08:33:32] <arschmitz> but i cant go from albums to friend EVER with out scrolling first or making a markup change

[09:41:12] <bot-t> (13 hours 20 mins ago) <johnbender> tell kinblas purely for reading pdfs (better aspect ratio than any other 7 inch tablet at 1.3). If it's not mind blowingly awesome I'll return it
[09:41:32] <johnbender> kinblas: ^
[09:41:48] <kinblas> johnbender: sweet, I was debating whether or not to pick one up too
[09:41:56] <kinblas> let me know how it is
[09:41:57] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm having second thoughts now
[09:42:29] <johnbender> kinblas: I can buy more than 25,000 sheets of paper for the same price
[09:42:37] <kinblas> johnbender: my one hesitation was the fact that it wasn't retina?
[09:42:37] <johnbender> (pdfs) :P
[09:42:51] <johnbender> kinblas: I keep hearing that but I was under the impression that it is retina
[09:42:57] <kinblas> johnbender: then you'd have to waste ink for that many pages
[09:43:03] <johnbender> kinblas: ahh that's true
[09:43:08] <kinblas> johnbender: it's the original screen 1024x768
[09:43:08] <johnbender> ink is expensive
[09:43:17] <johnbender> kinblas: I find that bizarre
[09:43:34] <kinblas> johnbender: so did I .. it's basically a shrunk down 2nd gen iPad
[09:43:47] <johnbender> kinblas: hmm, well I'll let you know how it it is
[09:43:53] <johnbender> more and more it seems like I"ll be sending it back
[09:43:58] * kinblas thinks he's going to wait for 2nd gen mini with retina
[09:44:33] <kinblas> johnbender: even the smaller phones have retina … not sure why they did that?

[10:17:41] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: one thing scottjehl__ and I are still discussing is how to handle the MQs
[10:18:08] <toddmparker> Last night, I had removed these from the structure and pasted in a style block for each demo
[10:18:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: demos are looking really nice!
[10:18:23] <toddmparker> thanks
[10:18:31] <toddmparker> better if you pull and view locally
[10:18:40] <toddmparker> branch preview is out of date
[10:18:41] <uGoMobi> I was also thinking about how we should handle that
[10:18:52] <uGoMobi> same for fieldcontain
[10:19:27] <uGoMobi> isn't easy to override the default ones we use with breakpoint 450px
[10:21:48] <toddmparker> one idea is to include a sensible default set of MQs but scope these against a class so they don't kick in unless you opt in by adding a class to your table
[10:22:11] <uGoMobi> yes like ui-responsive
[10:22:17] <toddmparker> that way, if you need to customize, you can copy the MQ block, change values and give it a new class name
[10:22:20] <toddmparker> yes
[10:22:37] <uGoMobi> but then we set the breakpoints
[10:23:00] <uGoMobi> many devs will be ok with that
[10:23:33] <toddmparker> for example, on the reflow docs we have the block
[10:23:34] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/tables/docs/tables/table-reflow.html
[10:24:36] <toddmparker> and on other examples we basically copy the same code into the demo
[10:24:41] <toddmparker> just feels messy
[10:24:43] <uGoMobi> does the media attribute only work on stylesheet links or can you use it to target a script?
[10:24:56] <uGoMobi> just something that crossed my mind
[10:25:04] <toddmparker> ideally, people would use classes and organize all MQs in a separate css
[10:25:18] <toddmparker> i think just css
[10:25:34] <toddmparker> we extend that in our enhance.js plugin at filament
[10:25:35] <uGoMobi> think so too
[10:25:38] <toddmparker> but not here
[10:27:08] <uGoMobi> would be nice if we could offer a simple way to alter the breakpoints
[10:31:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I think I don't have access to http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/
[10:31:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: can you tell me what we use there to style code blocks?
[10:31:57] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I created a source code viewer for the demos but thought it would be good idea to use same styling as API docs
[10:33:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: nevermind, sorry... I do have access to that repo
[10:33:56] <uGoMobi> was looking at the wrong place
[10:38:10] <mspisars> on a custom select, if the selected option is changed programatically... how do I get the select to update the button to show the selected/updated option?
[10:41:17] <uGoMobi> mspisars: I think $(".selector").selectmenu("refresh") should do the trick
[10:41:37] <mspisars> oh on value change also.
[10:41:46] <mspisars> i was just doing it on content change.
[10:41:54] <mspisars> lemme try...
[10:56:37] <toddmparker> have you guys read the whole jpeg retina article?
[11:01:16] <mspisars> $(".selector").selectmenu("_destroy") is this legal?
[11:02:51] <mspisars> its actually ...$(".selector").selectmenu("destroy")
[11:04:32] <gseguin> you can't call underscored methods in a widget
[11:19:15] <mspisars> is there a way to tell a custom select not to use a dialog when the data set is large.
[11:24:22] <toddmparker> this will blow your mind
[11:24:40] <toddmparker> basically, instead of serving up an SD and retina photo
[11:24:49] <johnbender> mspisars: It think that's a feature request
[11:25:02] <johnbender> mspisars: that is, one that's already been logged
[11:25:05] <johnbender> I could be wrong though
[11:25:38] <toddmparker> take the retina image, compress it to almost zero quality and serve it to all. on SD, it will scale it down to fit into the smaller footprint and that tens to hide all the compression artifacts
[11:25:45] <toddmparker> look at this one:
[11:25:46] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/egazaw/5/
[11:26:05] <toddmparker> the left is the retina image, compressed at 19% quality
[11:26:17] <toddmparker> the right is the original apple SD image
[11:26:24] <toddmparker> on SD, both look the same
[11:26:35] <toddmparker> on a HD display, the left is billion times better
[11:26:57] <toddmparker> best part is the retina image is ~20% smaller than the SD!
[11:32:34] <toddmparker> read this: http://blog.netvlies.nl/design-interactie/retina-revolution/
[12:04:52] <gseguin> that's pretty amazing!
[12:07:35] <toddmparker> yep
[12:07:43] <toddmparker> simple hack to make retina work
[12:07:55] <toddmparker> no media queries, no JS
[12:13:28] <uGoMobi> cool article
[12:26:36] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: how goes
[12:27:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: good :)
[12:27:34] <toddmparker> johnbender: do you know has fast the branch previews update? thought it was hourly but seems like daily
[12:27:36] <uGoMobi> working on getting the demo JS code in the source view as well
[12:27:41] <uGoMobi> and the CSS
[12:27:56] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: cool. i'm itching to get those new demos underway
[12:28:01] <toddmparker> going to be great
[12:30:45] <uGoMobi> yeah me too
[12:32:04] <uGoMobi> but want to get this view source code thing right first because that defines if demo JS and CSS should go in the head or in a separate file etc.
[12:35:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: got to the heart of issue #4250 it seems related to Wilto: fav issue
[12:36:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: which is?
[12:36:32] <uGoMobi> the internet?
[12:36:39] <arschmitz> absolute inside absolute inside fixed
[12:36:55] <uGoMobi> ah that one
[12:37:00] <arschmitz> which isnt happening here but the image stuff related to that applys
[12:37:10] <uGoMobi> I see
[12:37:15] <arschmitz> if i make the images their native demensions it works fine
[12:37:27] <arschmitz> or if i make the image relative vs absolute its fine
[12:39:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: my only solution so far though is to make the images position static then adjust the padding
[12:40:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am not sure if we should try to fix this by making changes to the list with thumbs
[12:40:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i wasent saying we should i was just saying its all iv come up with so far
[12:40:56] <uGoMobi> if you have a list with formatted text and use class ui-li-aside you will have another element with position absolute
[12:41:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok I understand
[12:41:59] <uGoMobi> nice that you found nature of this annoying bug
[12:42:09] <arschmitz> it only seems to be an image absolutly positioned thats not its native size
[12:42:09] <uGoMobi> the*
[12:42:22] <uGoMobi> bizarre
[12:42:48] <arschmitz> and some how it only effects the second button in the fixed footer
[12:44:15] <uGoMobi> and only if you hold your phone in your right hand? ;-)
[12:46:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: pretty close only in portrait mode
[12:46:30] <uGoMobi> haha
[12:46:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but i have a feeling that might have to do with proximity to the image
[12:47:26] <uGoMobi> yes sounds like it
[12:47:53] <arschmitz> strange though because it isnt the button that sits on top its the one that sites next to it
[12:51:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what happens if you make the thumb twice as width? does the problem shift to the next button?
[12:52:26] <arschmitz> ill try that i just realized though what it is it has to overlap the border of the image so be partily over the image but not fully
[12:54:20] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:56:24] <johnbender> toddmparker: it's supposed to be hourly
[12:56:25] <johnbender> let me check
[12:57:46] <johnbender> toddmparker: hmm, it was switch to be changes to git which doesn't make any sense since we can't watch all the branches
[12:57:51] <johnbender> *switched
[12:58:02] <johnbender> I don't *think* I did that but who knows
[12:58:08] <johnbender> anywy it's hourly now
[12:58:10] <johnbender> building
[13:00:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: DOH! double width is the native size ha ha was like weird no all buttons work!
[13:16:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so there seems to be something special about 123px; if the images are at least 123px; everything works fine any less the one button breaks
[13:16:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but the native size is 160px;
[13:17:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and it just has to be height or width thats at least that not both
[13:19:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what is the device-width?
[13:19:39] <uGoMobi> still have 4 buttons on the test page?
[13:19:43] <arschmitz> yes
[13:19:48] <arschmitz> tried 5 and 3 also
[13:19:52] <arschmitz> 3 all work
[13:20:02] <arschmitz> 5 the second one still dosent but rest do
[13:20:08] <uGoMobi> you really tried everything! :)
[13:20:16] <arschmitz> its driving me crazy!
[13:20:25] <uGoMobi> I wanted to calculate the width of the buttons
[13:21:27] <arschmitz> ill get the button width.
[13:21:33] <arschmitz> device width is 320
[13:21:49] <uGoMobi> ok so buttons should be 80px
[13:25:00] <frequent> johnbender: got a nav-minute?
[13:26:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you remove the margin-right 10px and float left from the thumb... does the magic number 123px change?
[13:27:33] <arschmitz> i had played with that before but not in connection to the 123px let me check
[13:27:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/lEZsXw

[13:32:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/xk1qsQ
[13:32:17] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/master b5db639 Gabriel Schulhof: [buttonMarkup] Track addition/removal of up/down/hover classes to reconstruct button state during re-enhancement -- Fixes #3637
[13:32:17] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/master f1e4913 Gabriel Schulhof: Merge commit 'b5db639bb7cd1269c2a86bebab3a42d0db678fe7'
[13:33:59] <_|Nix|_> Whoops ... that was a merge ...
[13:35:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Fixing #4317 involved implementing _setOption() for the button widget, which means that all of its options can now be set on-the-fly (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/2e21c6b92a2fc919c46244874de9da7a52173b50). Should I cherry-pick that back to 1.2-stable and 1.1-stable?
[13:37:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: On the one hand, it's a bug fix, but OTOH it's a new feature (albeit small).
[13:53:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so with more testing nothing special about 123px; what it is is if you tap the button where it overlaps the image it works where it dosent overlap the image it dosent fire
[14:00:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: does setting position relative for .ui-content .ui-listview make any difference?
[14:01:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: got the feeling this is going to be really though to fix
[14:01:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no difference, and im pretty sure your right
[14:03:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there only way around it so far seems to be to change the image and link css so the image isnt absolute; but thats not realy a solution
[14:04:40] <uGoMobi> we could mention this at the known issues with fixed toolbars in the docs
[14:05:43] <arschmitz> might be the only way to go think it might also be related to issue #3748
[14:05:48] <uGoMobi> when we make it possible to disable them on android 2.3 by leaving out the extension you have been working people can consider this
[14:06:07] <uGoMobi> *working on
[14:06:23] <arschmitz> its done iv been waiting for feedback on it^^
[14:07:23] <uGoMobi> I will try to give that a look tomorrow
[14:07:32] <arschmitz> cool
[14:07:40] <arschmitz> think everyone has just been busy
[14:08:18] <arschmitz> so i was working on this one hoping to get a fix in for it but it appears to not be related to the fixed header footer so much as listview
[14:08:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: there is a limit to what we can do
[14:09:32] <arschmitz> you mean as far as actually being able to fix some of these or in terms of time
[14:11:23] <uGoMobi> first one
[14:11:47] <arschmitz> thats what i thought though the second goes with out saying i think !
[14:12:37] <uGoMobi> we could keep trying until there are no devices with Android 2.3 out there anymore ;-)
[14:12:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i really just want to iron out most of the problems with the fixed toolbars as much as possible. Kinda my personal goal!
[14:13:13] <uGoMobi> at some point you better decide to accept it and spend time on things we can fix
[14:13:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[14:14:05] <uGoMobi> those issues were really annoying me and thats why I wanted to focus on those during dev summit
[14:14:11] <arschmitz> but the workarounds extension will kill nearly half of the open issues so i think that will be pretty good
[14:14:23] <uGoMobi> exactly
[14:14:43] <arschmitz> hey do you know a way to test in a webview in android?
[14:14:58] <uGoMobi> install phonegap on the SDK
[14:15:09] <arschmitz> damn
[14:15:14] <arschmitz> lol
[14:15:18] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:15:33] <arschmitz> in ios its easy just throw it on the homescreen
[14:15:56] <uGoMobi> yeah I know
[14:16:06] <uGoMobi> that one is missing in Android
[14:16:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[14:16:44] <arschmitz> for 4250 im thinking a docs note will do it its a really easy fix with css
[14:17:04] <arschmitz> two rules will fix it
[14:17:38] <arschmitz> position:static on image and padding:none on link makes it look exactly the same but work
[14:19:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: another thing you can try is  -webkit-transform:translate3d(0,0,0); for the listview or list items
[14:20:02] <arschmitz> ill try that
[14:20:20] <arschmitz> found some intresting stuff on another one you had been looking at the other day
[14:20:37] <uGoMobi> it triggers hardware cpu acceleration which sometimes resolves things
[14:20:45] <arschmitz> issue #3912 - Touch events passing through fixed toolbar
[14:20:55] <uGoMobi> ah that one
[14:21:00] <frequent> uGoMobi: is -webkit-transform:translate3d(0,0,0); safe to use?
[14:21:17] <arschmitz> in your fiddle removing the label resolves all problems with the pass through on the header
[14:21:20] <frequent> uGoMobi: and hi
[14:21:28] <arschmitz> or jsbin rather
[14:22:00] <uGoMobi> hi frequent: I think it is safe
[14:22:49] <frequent> ok. Thx
[14:23:38] <frequent> I'm chasing broken text input on Android 2.3. and am down to pulling out all the webkits such as transform-translate
[14:23:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you mean that issue only happens in JS Bin
[14:24:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no the select has a <label> removing it fixes everything for some reason
[14:26:05] <uGoMobi> :/
[14:26:37] <arschmitz> havent made it much further then that but i was planning to but seems some how related to the <label> element
[14:27:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: isn't it just because without label the select button is at a different position?
[14:27:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no i adjusted position
[14:27:53] <uGoMobi> ah ok, was about to suggest to test that
[14:28:02] <uGoMobi> but you think of everything :)
[14:28:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: I try always helpfull to have input from others though
[14:28:48] <arschmitz> you lead me down the right path with the list view with position absolute
[14:28:48] <uGoMobi> yes for sure
[14:29:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im going to head home though might do some more testing on those tonight
[14:29:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill see you in the morning
[14:29:59] <uGoMobi> ok good night
[14:30:04] <uGoMobi> see you tomorrow
[14:33:38] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[14:33:39] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #798: FIXED in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/798/
[14:57:29] <Wilto> arschmitz: Oh damn; shout-out to my favorite bug.
[15:10:09] <agcolom> Good evening! People still around?
[15:13:00] <agcolom> toddmparker: ?
[15:14:14] <agcolom> toddmparker_: toddmparker__ ^
[15:14:28] <agcolom> I need to check something with you in docs/tables/table-column-toggle.html
[15:27:04] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom
[15:27:29] <uGoMobi> agcolom: for the API docs do you use tabs or 4 spaces?
[15:28:01] <uGoMobi> for indent that is
[15:28:39] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper! we use tabs in the api docs
[15:28:48] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[15:29:05] <agcolom> toddmparker: I have made 2 comments in this commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/e444c8bb8491dcb0c276d08ca4434378b2329842
[15:29:15] <agcolom> uGoMobi: No problem :-)
[15:29:44] <agcolom> Looks like everyone left early today... It's that 1 hour less we have with the US this week!
[15:30:30] <agcolom> johnbender: thanks! I'll add it tomorrow morning...
[15:33:11] <agcolom> OMG! 298 issues! we're below 300!
[15:35:29] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Am I right in thinking that checkboxes and radio buttons are actually the same widget (checkboxradio)?
[15:35:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[15:35:59] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[15:37:54] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I noticed that in the new API docs some components are documented as separate widgets
[15:38:16] <uGoMobi> like checkbox and radio
[15:38:46] <uGoMobi> not sure if this isn't confusing
[15:38:50] <agcolom> yes, I'll check at teh meeting whether this is ok, or should be combined...
