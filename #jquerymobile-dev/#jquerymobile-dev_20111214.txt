[07:31:52] <Wilto> Hey, anyone here? Need a quick favor.
[07:46:58] <sven_franck> Wilto: trade a favor for an answer? :-)
[07:47:24] <Wilto> Sure thing. Mine requires a BlackBerry 6/7 emulator, though.
[07:47:34] <sven_franck> ok... don't have that
[07:47:46] <sven_franck> I could sneak up on my girlfriends backberry tonight.
[07:49:46] <sven_franck> Wilto: question anyway ;-) :
[07:49:48] <sven_franck> That responsible img page you did recently does not work actually, does it? You were only testing whether the image was displayed correctly?
[07:49:48] <Wilto> Ah, it’s a pain to get a screenshot off an actual device.
[07:49:50] <Wilto> Shoot.
[07:50:14] <sven_franck> (I can dogde bullets)
[07:57:57] <toddmparker_> hey all - I just added a blocker issue to support 1.7 in our next release (1.1): https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3268
[07:57:58] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3268 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1m ago): Add support for jQuery core 1.7
[07:58:14] <toddmparker_> think we should make the change today so we can see what issues crop up?
[08:05:03] <Wilto> I like that idea.
[08:05:12] <Wilto> I’m sure it won’t be anything too insane.
[08:26:58] <gseguin> Good morning all
[08:30:39] <gseguin> toddmparker_: +1 on jQuery 1.7
[08:53:20] <toddmparker_> great gseguin - i think we meant to add this in right after 1.0
[08:53:26] <toddmparker_> good to live with it a while
[08:53:38] <toddmparker_> not sure how we test 1.6.4 and 1.7
[08:53:42] <toddmparker_> tricky
[08:54:00] <gseguin> can't we say 1.1 requires 1.7
[08:54:01] <gseguin> ?
[08:55:07] <toddmparker_> feel like UI normally supports the latest 2 versions
[08:55:16] <gseguin> oh ok
[08:55:32] <toddmparker_> but we can mainly focus on 1.7 since there are soe big changes
[08:55:40] <toddmparker_> and try to keep an eye on 1.6.4
[08:55:52] <toddmparker_> maybe bender will have ideas
[08:56:01] <toddmparker_> maybe we can have the test suite run on both?
[08:56:08] <Wilto> +1 to that.
[08:56:21] <gseguin>  we could
[08:56:36] <Wilto> The only big standout issue I can think of is the new “live()” business.
[08:56:49] <Wilto> And I seem to recall we switched those all over to delegate?
[08:57:26] <gseguin> not sure we have yet
[08:57:33] <gseguin> eddie had a PR for that
[09:03:53] <toddmparker_> kinblas: you around?
[09:04:05] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yup
[09:04:11] <toddmparker_> ice cream sandwich is not pretty with transitions
[09:04:24] * kinblas sighs
[09:04:28] <toddmparker_> seems more like sh*t sandwich
[09:04:31] <toddmparker_> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHKozRk29b0
[09:04:35] <kinblas> toddmparker_: LOL
[09:05:30] <kinblas> god same problems
[09:05:39] <kinblas> we should forward this to that guy
[09:05:40] <toddmparker_> you'd think they would, you know, improve their browser with each version
[09:05:46] <toddmparker_> yeah!
[09:05:55] <toddmparker_> mind doing that
[09:07:19] <kborchers> any of you guys able to unmute -meeting for us silly UI guys that don't have permission?
[09:09:13] <toddmparker_> sure kborchers
[09:09:18] <kborchers> thanks!
[09:28:37] <johnbender> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3230#issuecomment-3134499
[09:28:38] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3230 on jquery-mobile, reported by ucavus (1w, 12h ago): sole dialogs as initial content/external page shows a blank screen
[09:28:47] <johnbender> anotating pages with data-role=dialog is valid
[09:29:15] <toddparker> that was my Q
[09:30:01] <johnbender> ah
[09:30:05] <johnbender> the root page is a dialog
[09:30:20] <johnbender> yah we don't support that, let me check if I can reproduce the blank
[09:30:57] <toddparker> i see
[09:31:06] <toddparker> i'm asking scott about this too
[09:31:20] <toddparker> not sure why we support this role
[09:31:29] <johnbender> toddparker: it pulls the first page element
[09:31:34] <toddparker> since a page is a dialog based on the link data-rel
[09:31:45] <johnbender> toddparker: the link rel=dialog was added after the fact
[09:32:00] <toddparker> no, that was how it worked from the start
[09:32:06] <johnbender> toddparker: but people can load arbitrary pages and it's nice to let the server decide
[09:32:19] <johnbender> toddparker: hmm I remember that being added after the fact but I could be wrong
[09:32:34] <johnbender> in either case the server should be able to participate in that decision
[09:51:46] <toddmparker_> meaning that adding the role to the page woudl style it like a dialog?
[10:05:06] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: hey
[10:05:12] <toddmparker_> hey sven_franck
[10:05:23] <sven_franck> I need another 1-2 hrs to finish my manual
[10:05:30] <sven_franck> I will then mail it out to the group
[10:05:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes, the only reason I think it's reasonable is that we councel data-ajax=false so often that it's not fair to assume people won't dialogs on the other side of that
[10:05:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's a feature
[10:05:53] <sven_franck> do we want to do Q&A/show after the weekly meeting tomorrow?
[10:06:26] <sven_franck> or during the meeting
[10:08:14] <toddmparker_> good question
[10:08:32] <toddmparker_> let's plan on doing it near the end and we cna see who can stay later
[10:08:43] <toddmparker_> how much time would you need to demo it
[10:08:48] <toddmparker_> + Q & A time
[10:10:47] <sven_franck> toddmparker_  I think the demo is pretty much 10-15mins
[10:10:59] <sven_franck> Questions... don't know
[10:25:15] <toddmparker_> ok, we'll try to start at 2:45
[10:25:26] <toddmparker_> it'sa  google hangout
[10:25:30] <toddmparker_> link wil be here
[10:26:43] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: ok, cool
[10:27:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm stealing your jqcon keynot description for my LARuby talk proposal
[10:27:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: lots a rewording
[10:27:37] <toddmparker_> go for it!
[10:27:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: thanks
[10:27:53] <toddmparker_> let me know if you need slides

[11:39:06] <toddmparker_> kinblas:
[11:39:10] <toddmparker_> you around
[11:39:24] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yup
[11:39:29] <toddmparker_> oh hey
[11:39:38] <toddmparker_> been working with scott via AIM
[11:39:49] <kinblas> uh huh
[11:39:59] <toddmparker_> been making good progress on the fixed header stuff with him and wilto
[11:40:19] <toddmparker_> anyway, once that is wrapped, i asked him to work with you on transitions
[11:40:40] <toddmparker_> since he may time to prototype some stuff while you look at the basic reasearch stuff
[11:40:50] <Wilto> I am back to my safe, Android-complication-free AJAX-y links. I like it here.
[11:41:18] <toddmparker_> i think wilto, soctt and i are all on board with the idea of building a much faster, simpler page transition
[11:41:27] <Wilto> Fo’ sho’.
[11:41:45] <toddmparker_> we'll keep what we have but have a new default transition that focuses on being our own thing
[11:42:36] <toddmparker_> we're leaning towards is just doing a very simple/fast fade out, scroll + subtle loader > fade in
[11:42:40] <kinblas> toddmparker_: what's more simple than what we are doing already?
[11:42:41] <kinblas> :-)
[11:42:55] <kinblas> fades are so faded
[11:43:12] <toddmparker_> the whole slide transition is very ios
[11:43:20] <toddmparker_> which some will like
[11:43:23] <Wilto> And doesn’t necessarily make sense.
[11:43:36] <Wilto> Where we’re not always “drilling down,” but just kinda moving sideways in most cases.
[11:43:42] <toddmparker_> but i sort of think the slide makes sense when drilling through hierarchical info
[11:43:48] <toddmparker_> a website ain't that
[11:43:48] <Wilto> I kinda think we’re just used to it.
[11:44:06] <toddmparker_> so I just want a simple, polished page transition that doesn't get in your way
[11:44:17] <kinblas> it's a mobile paradigm
[11:44:24] <kinblas> everyone uses it side slides
[11:44:29] <kinblas> even HP WebOS
[11:44:44] <toddmparker_> nt saying we ditch slide
[11:44:54] <Wilto> Oh, no. It still makes sense in some cases.
[11:44:55] <toddmparker_> saying that i'd rather not try and copy an OS
[11:45:01] <kinblas> toddmparker_: personally, I hate the fades on iPad
[11:45:09] <kinblas> hate is a strong word
[11:45:17] <toddmparker_> yeah, seriously geez
[11:45:21] <kinblas> but ... when on Ipad looking at our docs
[11:45:27] <kinblas> lol
[11:45:29] <kinblas> sorry
[11:45:37] <kinblas> when we switched to fades above 1024
[11:45:38] <toddmparker_> yeah, but a slide would give you whiplash
[11:45:49] <kinblas> something just felt old
[11:46:14] <toddmparker_> well, i'm thinking less of a cross-fade
[11:46:16] <kinblas> "movement" conveys "change"
[11:46:22] <toddmparker_> more of a fade out > loader >in
[11:46:23] <eddiemonge> how about a spinner transition like the old timey tv shows
[11:46:23] <kinblas> I think I remember someone in XD saying that
[11:46:30] <kinblas> X.D.
[11:46:35] <toddmparker_> movement also conveys "blink"
[11:46:40] <toddmparker_> ;)
[11:46:42] <kinblas> eddiemonge: like batman shows?
[11:46:49] <kinblas> toddmparker_: touche'
[11:47:20] <toddmparker_> my gut tells me that transitions will never look good in android unless we stop trying to do so much
[11:47:21] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so the problem with fade-out, fade-in
[11:47:30] <eddiemonge> kinblas: thats exactly what i was thinking
[11:47:41] <toddmparker_> i'll pick a smooth, clean experience over something cool but twitchy
[11:47:44] <kinblas> is it extends the transition time
[11:48:03] <toddmparker_> not sure that's true
[11:48:05] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah, me too, it sucks that basic things don't work
[11:48:25] <toddmparker_> if you measure the time it takes from when you jerk you up, then finish the slide
[11:48:28] <eddiemonge> like http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=do+a+barrel+roll
[11:48:34] <toddmparker_> (and the leader before)
[11:48:42] <toddmparker_> loader before, sorry
[11:49:02] <toddmparker_> this is why we need to build a prototype
[11:49:15] <kinblas> toddmparker_: all those things add to the feeling of sluggishness
[11:49:23] <kinblas> when lined up back to back in serial
[11:49:27] <toddmparker_> we need to answer the question of how fast and clean we can get these while still looking "in control" visually
[11:49:32] <kinblas> yeah
[11:49:46] <toddmparker_> so don't get hung on fade or not
[11:50:08] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm intrested to see what you guys have up your sleeves ... you're great at visuals
[11:50:22] <kinblas> eye candy gets folks excited
[11:50:30] <toddmparker_> right now, our transitions feel like a monkey riding a unicycle while having a seizure
[11:50:38] <kinblas> lol
[11:50:41] <toddmparker_> heh
[11:50:49] <kinblas> more like a monkey with turets
[11:51:26] <toddmparker_> ok, i'll give you that
[11:52:09] <kinblas> ... it goes, but it will be jumpy, most of the times unpredictably
[11:54:29] <toddmparker_> so i'm curious if you can try and figure out what things may be safer to use
[11:54:49] <toddmparker_> obviously, the double page blink in android is bad
[11:55:28] <toddmparker_> so in your opinion, is there any sort of page transition effect that won't cause a double blink or the white flash
[11:57:02] <toddmparker_> has anyone anywhere done things that look ok in android?
[11:57:32] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: I'm trying ;-)
[11:57:51] <toddmparker_> i know!
[11:58:01] <sven_franck> but I can't recall the last non-blinking transition either...
[11:58:16] <toddmparker_> but i'm at the point where i'm tempted to nix transitions on android across the board because it's so bad
[11:59:38] <sven_franck> I can understand
[12:02:38] <toddmparker_> kinblas: for example, on ios when i switch between tab views, there is no transition at all because I'm moving laterally
[12:02:49] <toddmparker_> when I drill in, I get a slide
[12:03:10] <toddmparker_> opening a setting or utility slides up of flips in
[12:03:26] <toddmparker_> but we sort of just slide everywhere and it makes no sense spatially
[12:06:36] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I get it ... we're trying to convey meaning with transitions
[12:06:48] <kinblas> no more gratuitous movements for the sake of eye candy
[12:07:08] <toddmparker_> right
[12:07:27] <toddmparker_> which androids were consistently doing the double blink?
[12:07:47] <kinblas> toddmparer_: that's because links use the default (slide) transition
[12:07:53] <kinblas> there is no context of the navigation
[12:08:09] <kinblas> ... triggered by a link
[12:08:20] <toddmparker_> right
[12:08:37] <toddmparker_> but I think we should default to a faster, more neutral transition
[12:08:47] <toddmparker_> honeycomb is such garbage
[12:09:42] <toddmparker_> ok, so all transitions EXCEPT fade result in the double blink
[12:10:03] <toddmparker_> fade still looks like crap but much less than the others
[12:10:10] <toddmparker_> ...on honeycomb
[12:15:10] <Wilto> They’re all laughably bad on Honeycomb.
[12:15:37] <toddmparker_> so kinblas - any idea why fade wouldn't exhibit the double blink issue?
[12:15:48] <toddmparker_> wondering if that's a CLUE
[12:17:55] <Wilto> ?OBJECTION
[12:17:56] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/objection.jpg
[12:18:06] <Wilto> Sorry; still playing Phoenix Wright. Carry on.
[12:27:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm not sure, in theory, at least on iOS, opacity animations are handled by the GPU, not sure about ICS or Honeycomb
[12:27:17] <toddmparker_> it's odd
[12:27:29] <kinblas> from Nicolas' reply it sounds that anything pre-honeycomb was not GPU accelerated, and therefore just rendered on a separate thread
[12:27:56] <kinblas> which is some boost because it's not delayed by events generated by the user, but still cpu/resource constrained
[12:28:02] <toddmparker_> i'm just curious why opacity fade doesn't cause the double blink
[12:28:22] <toddmparker_> is it because only on page is being transformed
[12:28:51] <toddmparker_> it's pretty clear the other than ipads, tablets aren't powerful enough to handle transitions
[12:29:00] <kinblas> toddmparker_: we don't transform the from page in a slide up/down
[12:29:06] <kinblas> but it still double blinks
[12:29:08] <toddmparker_> testing them all now and they are unacceptable across the board
[12:29:15] <toddmparker_> hmm
[12:29:20] <toddmparker_> that is still a clue
[12:29:35] <toddmparker_> (tiny one)
[12:29:38] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it's transformations that cause the blink .. I think we know that
[12:30:05] <toddmparker_> but fade is an opacity transformation, just like the others?
[12:31:24] <kinblas> no, it does not use transform
[12:31:28] <kinblas> it uses opacity
[12:31:32] <toddmparker_> ah-ha!
[12:31:48] <toddmparker_> kidding
[12:31:49] <kinblas> it's implementation dependent as to whether opacity animations and transformations go through the same rendering pipeline
[12:32:15] <kinblas> opacity still drops lots of frames though
[12:32:20] <toddmparker_> implementation, meaning OS-level or each OEM?
[12:32:25] <toddmparker_> heck yeah it does
[12:32:28] <kinblas> OEM/Browser
[12:32:32] <toddmparker_> but it doesn't lose it's mind
[12:32:57] <toddmparker_> both our HC tablets have identical perf
[12:33:03] <toddmparker_> so i think it's OS level
[12:33:12] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it may be that opacity goes through the normal rendering chanels so that's why things look ok
[12:33:25] <toddmparker_> i.e. all HC devices go mental when you ask them to do a transformation
[12:33:32] <kinblas> but once you mix in a different thread (transforms) the compositor obviously has glitches
[12:33:49] <toddmparker_> yeah, like with pop
[12:34:00] <toddmparker_> that is opacity plus size/position
[12:34:14] <kinblas> toddmparker_: what it looks like to me
[12:34:34] <kinblas> is that Android is incorrectly resetting things back to the prop values at the beginning of the animation when it ends
[12:34:50] <kinblas> when it should be resetting them to values in the rule that kicked off the animation
[12:34:52] <toddmparker_> yeah, sort of does look like that
[12:35:02] <kinblas> I say that because of the flash of previous document
[12:35:05] <kinblas> page i meant
[12:35:07] <toddmparker_> is there a way to profile things to know that?
[12:35:09] <Wilto> —Wait.
[12:35:09] <kinblas> and then in the case of pop
[12:35:27] <kinblas> you sometimes see a flash of the mini version
[12:35:38] <kinblas> of the dialog/page that was just popped, at the end of the animation
[12:35:55] * kinblas waits for Wilto
[12:36:27] <toddmparker_> he has a theory
[12:36:28] <Wilto> I might know what the deal is, with the flash.
[12:36:32] <toddmparker_> googling now
[12:36:36] <Wilto> FoPP. Flash of Previous Page.
[12:37:04] <toddmparker_> like it
[12:38:13] <toddmparker_> kindle fire sometimes does a FoPP on the fades
[12:38:32] <toddmparker_> guess tehy monkey'd with things
[12:38:38] <Wilto> (“FoPP” copyright Marquis Design 2011, all rights reserved.)
[12:40:11] <Wilto> “animation-fill-mode”
[12:40:31] <Wilto> -webkit-animation-fill-mode: forwards;
[12:40:40] <Wilto> Retains the final state of the animation, post-animation.
[12:41:18] <Wilto> I missed a prime opportunity to actually use ?objection above, by the way. Kinda disappointed in myself.
[12:41:18] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/objection.jpg
[12:41:29] <Wilto> Thanks, Bots.
[12:45:42] <kinblas> Wilto: if that's what the problem is, shoot me ... the keyframe spec says that things reset to the values specified by the rule that kicked off the animation ... that's why things looked good on iOS back in alpha 2 or was it 3? when I set all of the rules to have the final values contained in the key-frame rules
[12:46:07] <kinblas> wasn't aware of this new property ... sigh
[12:46:14] <toddmparker_> worth looking into for sure
[12:46:28] <Wilto> I’m not sure it’s gonna be a big help, but it might in some cases.
[12:46:31] <Wilto> Couldn’t hurt.
[12:47:11] <toddmparker_> good stuff. worth poking at the problem to see if we're missing something
[12:47:30] <toddmparker_> i'm going go and spelunk back to the alphas to see if it's different on HC
[12:48:22] <Wilto> kinblas: http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-animations/#animation-fill-mode
[12:48:32] <Wilto> kinblas: If you’re feeling curious and/or masochistic.
[12:49:01] <kinblas> http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-animations/#animation-behavior-
[12:49:46] <Wilto> Yeah, normal behavior (I hate that that link makes sense to me).
[12:50:18] <Wilto> “…by default an animation does not affect property values after the animation ends (determined by the ‘animation-duration’ property). The value of ‘animation-fill-mode’ can override this behavior.”
[12:50:51] <toddmparker_> btw - full of FoPP in A2, A4, B2, etc.
[12:50:55] <toddmparker_> on HC
[12:53:56] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I meant on iOS
[12:54:39] <toddmparker_> so i should compare on an ipad?
[12:54:47] <toddmparker_> kinblas ^^
[12:55:21] <kinblas> Wilto: we should figure out if animation-fill-mode is different on Android
[12:55:37] <Wilto> Or if it is at all. It’s a pretty obscure one.
[12:56:22] <Wilto> Y’know. Nothin’ against Android.
[12:56:30] <Wilto> Some. Some things against Android.
[12:57:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I was just saying that the reason jQTouch transitions were blinking badly, as we were in Alpha 1/2 ... was because the *final* property values weren't specified in the rules that triggered the animation keyframe
[12:57:22] <toddmparker_> i see
[12:57:43] <kinblas> according to the spec, the properties animated in the keyframe, were only at play during the animation ... and things fell back to normal CSS cascade rules when it was done or not running
[12:57:50] <kinblas> that is why we had to specify the final values in the rules
[12:58:30] <kinblas> all this is still valid ... I guess the thing we need to check out is this newer animation-fill-mode property and see if Android is using something other than "none" as the default
[12:59:01] <kinblas> or if they don't support it at all and are basically treating things like "backwards"
[12:59:11] <kinblas> ... when the animation finishes
[12:59:23] <Wilto> I heart CSS animations.
[13:02:19] <toddmparker_> fun, fun
[13:02:50] <toddmparker_> it's pretty clear that there still isn't a version of Android that can do page animations.
[13:02:59] <toddmparker_> can't believe 4.0 is so bad
[13:03:54] <kinblas> toddmparker_: here's an exercise
[13:04:07] <kinblas> toddmparker_: forget about jQuery Mobile
[13:04:12] <kinblas> build 2 pages from the ground up
[13:04:16] <kinblas> and apply the animations
[13:04:24] <kinblas> it was interesting that I couldn't get things to flash
[13:04:39] <kinblas> until I started incorporating our jQM css
[13:04:53] <kinblas> I still think that is key to finding a workaround
[13:05:07] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I pushed my tests outside the firewall
[13:05:13] <kinblas> if you want to play with them
[13:05:50] <kinblas> toddmparker_: http://goo.gl/oz4NY
[13:05:57] <Wilto> I like where you’re at with that stuff, kinblas.
[13:05:58] <toddmparker_> cool
[13:05:59] <kinblas> complete with a nice short URL
[13:06:23] <Wilto> Yeah—I’ve been forgetting, it was the whole “parsing many selectors” thing that was blowing everything up.
[13:06:31] <Wilto> Which makes sense.
[13:06:36] <Wilto> …In an Android way.
[13:06:40] <kinblas> heh
[13:06:57] <kinblas> "Oh it's Android" that explains it
[13:07:02] <Wilto> Did we come up with any potential ways of working around that?
[13:07:14] <kinblas> nah, I got yanked to work on something internally
[13:07:20] <kinblas> temporarily
[13:07:28] <kinblas> so I haven't gotten much else done
[13:07:30] <Wilto> “Forget it, Jake. It’s C̶h̶i̶n̶a̶t̶o̶w̶n̶ Android.”
[13:07:34] <kinblas> just a lot of side conversations with you guys
[13:07:57] <Wilto> I’m still curious about detaching the CSS during an animation and re-attaching it after.
[13:08:06] <Wilto> Scary voodoo stuff, but it could work.
[13:09:44] <Wilto> And might help across the board; I assume animations trigger constant reflows on a bunch of gadgets.
[13:09:54] <Wilto> But I am crazytalkin’, for sure.
[13:10:30] <toddmparker_> so kin, is there a particular page that is most interesting to test
[13:11:13] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it is extremely easy to duplicate with the custom select dialog
[13:11:18] <kinblas> with states
[13:11:28] <kinblas> that's kind of what my tests were modeled after
[13:11:45] <toddmparker_> the FoPP
[13:11:51] <toddmparker_> ?
[13:11:52] <kinblas> ... and is what made me think it was due to the size of the content
[13:11:53] <kinblas> yeah
[13:12:01] <toddmparker_> gotcha
[13:12:04] <kinblas> heh a new acronym FoPP
[13:29:00] <toddmparker_> funny thing is all those links are so darn blinky
[13:29:14] <toddmparker_> it's bad all the way through
[13:29:31] <toddmparker_> it's not like it's good, then it goes off a cliff
[13:36:55] <kinblas> toddmparker_: all which links? My tests?
[13:37:14] <kinblas> toddmparker_: on what device? ICS?
[13:40:20] <Wilto> Hey kinblas, not to keep piling issues on you, but:
[13:41:55] <Wilto> Say I’m fetchlink-ing in a list of links.
[13:42:19] <Wilto> All said links will be broken once pulled into a page in another directory, because of the base tag.
[13:43:02] <Wilto> Any easy ways of correcting that spring to mind?
[13:44:21] <kinblas> yup
[13:44:37] <kinblas> Wilto: you want to look in the click code
[13:44:47] <kinblas> we fetch the closest Base URL
[13:44:56] <kinblas> and then resolve links against it
[13:45:04] <kinblas> that way relative links always work
[13:45:09] * kinblas gets a line number
[13:45:45] <kinblas> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1322
[13:46:07] <Wilto> You’re a hero.
[13:46:29] <Wilto> I was hoping I could just run the AJAX’d results through some magic function.
[13:46:53] * kinblas sighs
[13:46:59] <kinblas> Wilto: alas I let you down
[13:47:05] <kinblas> it's 2 magic functions
[13:47:05] <Wilto> oh no
[13:49:07] <kinblas> Wilto: btw, your result at that link, will be the href line below
[13:49:15] <kinblas> ... I meant at that line number
[13:49:41] <Wilto> THIS IS SO MUCH WORK KIN GOD
[13:49:52] <kinblas> lol
[13:50:08] <Wilto> My union will hear of this, toddmparker_.
[13:50:48] <toddmparker_> great, now the irish mafia are gonna come down on me
[13:51:32] <Wilto> That’s right.
[14:01:42] <Wilto> Actually, I guess this stuff is pretty well mired in navigation.js. This might actually be a little weird.
[14:02:28] <kinblas> Wilto: only the baseURL stuff is page specific
[14:02:41] <kinblas> the path utils really are independent
[14:02:47] <kinblas> they just currently live in navigation.js
[14:02:52] <Wilto> Just readin’ now, but these are exposed somewhere then?
[14:03:35] <kinblas> $.mobile.path.makeUrlAbsolute()
[14:03:49] <Wilto> Again: you’re a hero.
[14:04:21] <kinblas> hmmm, but getClosestBase() is a private function in navigation.js, though we could hang it off of $.mobile
[14:04:44] <Wilto> Ah, okay, that’s the one I was looking at. Can’t see any issue with exposin’ it, here.
[14:05:27] <kinblas> yeah there isn't an issue, it defaults to using $.mobile.documentBase
[14:05:30] <sven_franck> kinblas: I also woudn't mind exposing
[14:05:34] <kinblas> if you're using it outside a page context
[14:05:49] <sven_franck> one less copy&paste function for me :-)
[14:06:19] <kinblas> sven_franck: yeah I don't mind ... Wilto you doing it as part of your link-do-hickey?
[14:06:24] <Wilto> Yessir.
[14:06:31] <kinblas> okie dokie
[14:22:17] <toddmparker_> johnbender: you know what to think of this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3239#issuecomment-3116548
[14:22:18] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3239 on jquery-mobile, reported by alexhancock (5d, 23h ago): jQuery Mobile and $_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER']
[14:23:28] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/MpdwkA
[14:23:28] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3261 from jakeboone02/native-select-docs - Todd Parker
[14:36:36] <Wilto> For quick code to-dos, do we use the /* TODO: … */ convention?
[14:36:52] <Wilto> I feel like there was some discussion at one point, but I don’t really see ’em floating around.
[14:37:23] <gseguin> Wilto: +1
[14:40:12] <johnbender> Wilto: with or without the colon
[14:40:12] <Wilto> Eh, I’m basically just leaving myself a note on a branch in constant flux anyway. Prolly okay for this.
[14:40:15] <johnbender> doesn't matter
[14:40:26] <johnbender> but TODO's are encouraged imo
[14:40:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I thought I answered this
[14:40:46] <Wilto> Really, I just wanna use this swank TextMate 2 TODO organizer thingie.
[14:41:20] <toddmparker_> johnbender: here or in the issue?
[14:41:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: in the issue
[14:41:32] <johnbender> maybe I didn't submit
[14:41:35] <toddmparker_> i don't see a reply
[14:41:40] <toddmparker_> yeah, maybe
[14:41:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ahh I know what it iwas
[14:41:50] <toddmparker_> just cleaning out my inbox and that was still here
[14:41:51] <johnbender> I was looking to see if you could alter the referrer manually with javascript
[14:41:58] <toddmparker_> ah, good idea
[14:42:01] <johnbender> I don't think you can
[14:42:04] <johnbender> kinblas: ^
[14:44:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: anwered and closed
[14:44:44] <johnbender> answered*
[14:44:46] <toddmparker_> thanks!
[14:44:49] <johnbender> 99.9999% sure you can't do that
[14:44:59] <toddmparker_> bummer
[14:47:34] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm trying to figure out what I'm supposed to confirm/deny above??
[14:47:43] <Wilto> Hey johnbender, can I pester you about branches and such real quick?
[14:47:54] <johnbender> kinblas: altering the referrer in JS
[14:47:57] <johnbender> not possible
[14:48:08] <johnbender> Wilto: shoot
[14:49:00] <Wilto> So, say I feel it is time to get this fetchlink stuff off of the “experimental” branch and into like “experimental-fetchlinks.”
[14:49:13] <Wilto> And we have some half-baked dialog refactor stuff in this experimental branch.
[14:49:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/1NO7cg
[14:49:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] wait to focus page header until after mobile rendering class is stripped Fixes #2965 - John Bender
[14:49:49] <Wilto> I want to create a new branch and “cherrypick” the commits relevant to fetchlinks, yeah?
[14:50:00] <johnbender> Wilto: if they are intermixed you're kind of out of luck unless you want to branch new from Master and cherry pick the commits for a given feature onto the new branch
[14:50:03] <johnbender> yah
[14:50:26] <johnbender> in the future you guys will want to do the reverse
[14:50:39] <johnbender> branch per fine grained feature and then merge them together later
[14:50:49] <Wilto> So. In THEORY:
[14:51:26] <Wilto> If I were to branch master, then just take my fetchlink files and drop ’em in there—as they’re pretty damn self-contained…
[14:51:35] <Wilto> Uh, will any of you yell at me, is what I’m asking.
[14:51:48] <Wilto> Maybe we can just pretend I work fast and wrote it all in one commit.
[14:52:16] <johnbender> Wilto: you can do that, but we'll loose any work history on them
[14:52:20] <Wilto> I’m fine with nuking all the granular commit history—it’s not much code, and it was all me anyway, y’know?
[14:52:25] <johnbender> so I'll come find you to fix it if there's a bug
[14:52:31] <johnbender> :D
[14:52:46] <Wilto> Fair!
[14:52:55] <Wilto> And y’know, not sayin’ this is my new go-to approach.
[14:52:59] <Wilto> Just for now.
[14:53:42] <johnbender> cool
[14:55:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: looks like 1.7 should be easy until we get it out for people to try pre 1.1
[14:55:50] <Wilto> Anything jumping out at you as an issue?
[14:55:56] <toddmparker_> good
[14:56:20] <johnbender> just the ie exception that I addressed
[14:56:37] <johnbender> the  core folks did the right thing in exposing the exception
[14:56:44] <johnbender> they were swallowing it before
[14:57:57] <Wilto> I miss IE. I _pine_ for the days when IE was the worst browser I had to deal with.
[14:58:09] <Wilto> That is my life, now. I blame toddmparker_.
[14:58:43] <Wilto> I blame ajpiano, too.
[14:59:09] <Wilto> Headed out for the night, guys. Thanks for the help today.
[15:02:14] <ajpiano> my bad Wilto
[15:10:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to amd: http://git.io/nXEEeg

[15:23:05] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: wait to focus page header until after mobile rendering class is stripped Fixes #2965
[15:32:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to amd: http://git.io/CXKZkg
[15:32:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] Moved r.js and require.js to external - Ghislain Seguin
[15:32:25] <gseguin> johnbender: I just pushed my latest changes to the amd branch
[15:32:48] <gseguin> I externalized the stripping and moved r.js and require.js to external
[15:33:49] <gseguin> can't move order.js because otherwise I have to manually configure require,js in each doc page and that would be a PITA
[15:35:08] <gseguin> I'm not very proud of that stripping thing it's very likely to cause problems at some point but that's a start
[15:43:58] <johnbender> gseguin: cool I'll take a look now
[15:44:14] * johnbender is high on coffee right now
[15:44:20] * johnbender flying
[15:44:25] * johnbender is flying
[15:46:14] <johnbender> gseguin: does the amd branch need the almond submodule?
[15:46:21] <gseguin> nope
[15:46:36] <gseguin> it shouldn't be there
[15:49:44] <justinribeiro> kinblas: I gave those sample pages a run on the Galaxy Nexus, and they're all about the same blink wise
[15:50:09] <kinblas> justinribeiro: event the first couple of ones?
[15:50:27] <justinribeiro> yes, even samples 1 and 2
[15:50:32] <johnbender> justinribeiro: is the nexus out for mass consumption?
[15:51:03] <justinribeiro> Hit's Verizon tomorrow is my understanding
[15:51:22] <kinblas> wow that's pretty bad if 1 and 2 blink
[15:51:27] <kinblas> it's oh so basic
[15:51:48] <justinribeiro> Ya, I was a bit suprised after having looked at the code you had
[15:51:57] <justinribeiro> I would have expected it to work
[15:52:10] <johnbender> justinribeiro: color me jealous :D
[15:52:26] <kinblas> justinribeiro: yeah that's what I've been telling folks, it's not really jqm. :-)
[15:52:45] <kinblas> you can repro with basic JS that adds a class to trigger stuff
[15:54:51] <justinribeiro> We've tried other things on it as well and it's a bit of a craps shoot
[15:55:26] <kinblas> justinribeiro: so Wilto mentioned a newer related property that would be interesting to try
[15:56:14] <kinblas> ... though I'm thinking it might not make a difference, but worth a shot ...
[15:56:44] <justinribeiro> kinblas: I'm game, which property?
[15:56:47] <kinblas> you can try specifying -webkit-animation-fill-mode:none on the page elements
[15:56:50] <kinblas> http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-animations/#animation-fill-mode
[15:57:34] <kinblas> justinribeiro: that's based on our observation that it *looks* as if the android browser is trying to redraw the starting animation state upon completion
[15:58:01] <kinblas> the default should be none
[15:58:18] <kinblas> but it looks like the android browser is doing something like "backward"
[15:58:49] <kinblas> I'm not sure if the Android browser on ICS actually has that implemented though
[15:59:10] <justinribeiro> Not sure either, let me give it a go and we'll see what we get
[15:59:13] <kinblas> justinribeiro: what was interesting about your video was that there was no animation at all
[15:59:25] <kinblas> just flash, bang,
[15:59:27] <kinblas> :-)
[16:00:14] <justinribeiro> Ya, it was lacking a little smoothness ;-)
[16:02:23] <kinblas> that was a little surprising given the *NEW* hardware and *NEW* OS
[16:04:35] <johnbender> justinribeiro: is it just a debug device for you, or have you had occasion to use it as your primary phone?
[16:05:12] <justinribeiro> johnbender: I've been using it a bit as a phone the last couple of days, ICS is very nice
[16:05:17] <justinribeiro> johnbender: but mostly for debugging
[16:05:24] <johnbender> justinribeiro: cool
[16:05:45] <johnbender> I'm curious to see just how big it is in person
[16:05:54] * johnbender is not a fan of enormouse phones
[16:07:54] <johnbender> s/enormouse/enormous/
[16:08:33] <johnbender> http://www.aspexdesign.co.uk/hastings-photos/hastings-carnival-giant-mouse.jpg
[16:12:10] <justinribeiro> kinblas: tried using -webkit-animation-fill-mode:none on the page elements, no dice, same flash
[16:14:33] <justinribeiro> johnbender: the thing that surprised me about it was how light/thin it is given it's size.
[16:15:21] <johnbender> justinribeiro: I've been kind of hoping for something like the n9/lumia 800 with android on it
[16:20:57] <justinribeiro> johnbender: I don't have an N9 on the bench at the moment, but it's not much bigger (thinner, same weight as an N9 I believe)
[16:26:37] <johnbender> justinribeiro: http://www.phonearena.com/phones/Nokia-N9_id5187/size
[16:26:45] <kinblas> justinribeiro: thanks for trying that out .... one other thing to try?
[16:26:49] <johnbender> I have no idea how accurate that is
[16:28:02] <kinblas> justinribeiro: we're currently on using transformations when transitioning ... I'm curious if we added a rule so that it was always on ... .ui-page { -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0); }
[16:28:23] <kinblas> that might reduce flashing for ICS/honeycomb
[16:28:36] <kinblas> I think I tried that on honeycomb but it didn't do much
[16:28:50] <kinblas> it will chew up memory though
[16:29:07] <kinblas> ... or maybe it won't be that bad because I think we display:none non-visible pages
[16:29:22] <kinblas> iOS I believe will free the cached bitmap on display:none
[16:29:45] <kinblas> that's still not a solution for pre Android 3.x though
[16:29:58] <kinblas> since it had no GPU acceleration/bitmap caching
[17:08:51] <justinribeiro> kinblas: sorry about that, had to jump on a call
[17:08:57] <justinribeiro> let me try that right now
[17:10:37] <kinblas> justinribeiro: thanks
[17:29:04] <justinribeiro> kinblas: no dice. Having been playing with it, if I lengthen the animation duration from 350ms to say 2000ms, you can see that the animation works fine
[17:29:22] <justinribeiro> and that the flash that occurs is at the start and end of the animation
[17:30:05] <kinblas> sucks
[17:30:29] <kinblas> yeah the longer animation time allows for more frames ... less obvious that they are dropping frames
[17:31:27] <justinribeiro> definitely
[17:35:21] <justinribeiro> kinblas: I'll keeping chipping at it, ping me if you have any other ideas
[17:37:34] <kinblas> justinribeiro: thanks for trying it out
[17:37:44] <kinblas> back to the drawing board ... sigh
[17:38:01] <justinribeiro> kinblas: not a problem, happy to try to help sort it
[23:27:33] <johnbender> kinblas: that bug is closed :D
[23:27:44] <johnbender> though I might have misunderstood your last comment
[23:28:59] <kinblas> johnbender: lol, yeah I saw that after I submitted the comment
[23:29:10] <kinblas> but I seem to remember todd closing another bug
[23:29:17] <kinblas> maybe it was that one
[23:29:25] * kinblas shrugs
[23:29:40] <kinblas> so why would someone globally shut off ajax
[23:29:48] <kinblas> and then turn around and want to ajax in a dialog?
[23:32:50] <johnbender> kinblas: are you asking with regards to that bug?
[23:33:35] <kinblas> johnbender: I guess I commented because I saw the guy's patch ... and if he's proposing that we land it ... that I should mention that todd had told someone before that, it works as designed
[23:33:52] <johnbender> ah yah
[23:33:56] <johnbender> I talked with him about it today
[23:34:01] <johnbender> and that's consistent with what he said
[23:34:22] <kinblas> I didn't want to just shoot the guy down without confirming that his dialog was external
[23:34:26] <johnbender> I was thinking of: 1) someone turned off ajax for a form submission and then expected a dialog on the server side
[23:34:46] <johnbender> the server should be able to participate in how the page is rendered on the first page load imo
[23:34:52] <johnbender> but there are lots of considerations there
[23:35:21] <johnbender> I wouldn't call that one urgent
