[03:24:26] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: you here?
[03:24:57] <uGoMobi> I looked at your popup header/content/footer fiddle
[04:20:53] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: the problem is div content.... i adjusted first example in your fiddle to demonstrate http://jsfiddle.net/bwCsm/12/

[06:34:51] <ryanneufeld> anyone awake yet?
[07:10:47] <Wilto> Here.
[07:10:48] <bot-t> (15 hours 7 mins ago) <johnbender> tell Wilto: your `andversion == 4.0` pissed off the linter. I'm wondering if we can do that without the coercion
[07:11:07] <Wilto> Did it now.
[07:23:27] <ryanneufeld> would you guys consider 1.2 stable enough for production? Assuming since it's alpha, I' guessing not, but I'd like to use the popup functionality
[07:27:47] <ryanneufeld> is there much different from 1.1.1?
[08:25:11] <gnarf> btw - https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/913#issuecomment-8195321 -- got botio working somewhat
[08:25:27] <gnarf> cc toddmparker_ johnbender
[08:50:04] <johnbender> gnarf: ooooooooh
[08:50:16] <johnbender> gnarf: pong
[08:54:36] <johnbender> Wilto: did you push your change?
[08:54:41] <johnbender> Wilto: to master
[08:54:48] <johnbender> Wilto: I merged popup-simple
[08:55:01] <Wilto> Sweet.
[08:55:54] <Wilto> I haven’t pushed a “popup height > viewport height” fix anywhere; it’s not pressing for 1.2. Just something I’d like to get sorted.
[08:57:15] <johnbender> Wilto: did you push your change to that == anywhere?
[08:57:39] <Wilto> Oh, no—sorry. That should have read “did it now?” above.
[08:58:14] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm not sure how to answer that :(
[08:58:55] <Wilto> “Cheah cheah, son.”
[08:59:07] <johnbender> yes it's still broken
[08:59:22] <johnbender> the build that is
[08:59:32] <Wilto> Workin’ on it now.
[08:59:46] <johnbender> Wilto: thanks I went  to take care of it last night but I wanted to be sure I didn
[08:59:49] <johnbender> screw up the check
[09:06:44] <Wilto> Push to popup-simple, cherry-pick to master?

[09:14:40] <Wilto> You’re not the boss of me, doesallmagic.
[09:15:35] <Wilto> johnbender: Sorting that one too.
[09:16:35] <johnbender> Wilto: already got it
[09:16:44] <johnbender> Wilto: it's running the tests now
[09:16:49] <Wilto> Nice.
[09:22:36] <Wilto> ryanneufeld: Part of 1.2.
[09:22:46] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: thx
[09:22:54] <Wilto> Saw your earlier question, too—I’d hold off on using popup in production for the time being.
[09:23:05] <ryanneufeld> k, thanks!
[09:23:07] <Wilto> Not that there are any glaring issues with it, but it’s still early yet.
[09:23:34] <ryanneufeld> fair nuff
[09:24:55] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: yah we just made some changes internally which pushed us to make the next release a beta
[09:25:02] <johnbender> if nothing ugly shows up we'll go to an rc
[09:25:32] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[09:25:33] <ryanneufeld> okay
[09:26:05] <ryanneufeld> I've been tasked with making our mobile site display an interstitial ad for our new iphone app
[09:26:14] <ryanneufeld> thought popup was *perfect* for that
[09:26:47] <ryanneufeld> I know it's not recommended, but is there a sure fire way to detect IOS?
[09:27:02] <Wilto> BLASPHEMY
[09:27:35] <Wilto> No, I mean, nothing outside of either feature-based assumptions (please no) or UA-sniffing.
[09:28:33] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I don't want to bother non-ios users with an iphone app...
[09:28:47] <Wilto> We’re using `if ( !(/iPhone|iPad|iPod/.test( navigator.platform ) && navigator.userAgent.indexOf( "AppleWebKit" ) > -1 ) ) { …` to serve up the orientationchange fix.
[09:28:49] <ryanneufeld> and I also will set a stupid long cookie so you only see it once
[09:29:13] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: thanks, that'll do nicely
[09:29:14] <Wilto> (As in “exclude non-iOS,” so you gotta flip said script.)
[09:29:24] <ryanneufeld> sure
[09:29:27] <ryanneufeld> I can make that work
[09:30:28] <johnbender> Wilto: looks like we have a failure in selecmenu
[09:30:32] <johnbender> I'll get that one
[09:30:41] <Wilto> Failure-failure?
[09:32:18] <johnbender> Wilto: should be an easy one
[09:39:34] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: that condition, if AppleWebKit is in the UA string, and iP* is not in the platform?
[09:39:49] <johnbender> Wilto: arg
[09:39:53] <Wilto> oh no
[09:40:11] <johnbender> that delay we added to avoid the android issue grabs focus after the focus has been set by the select menu
[09:40:20] <Wilto> ghjkghjgkb
[09:40:30] <Wilto> I mean, “oh.”
[09:40:35] <johnbender> Wilto: hmm

[09:40:39] <johnbender> I need to think about this one
[09:41:05] <Wilto> Not a matter of timing, is it?
[09:41:17] <Wilto> If we zero out the setTimeout it still solved the Android thing, yeah?
[09:41:30] <johnbender> Wilto: correct
[09:41:34] <johnbender> it is a matter of timing
[09:41:51] <johnbender> setting the focus on the popup has to come before the select menu binding of "afteropen
[09:42:17] <johnbender> I moved the binding into the timeout
[09:42:23] <johnbender> err
[09:42:26] <johnbender> the trigger into the timeout

[10:13:39] <Wilto> johnbender: http://wil.to/_/success.gif
[10:22:15] <johnbender> Wilto: found a bug with our click bindings in Nav :/
[10:22:22] <Wilto> wat
[10:22:40] <johnbender> when I hit the popup buttons they get the active state from the vclick binding but no the click binding
[10:23:10] <Wilto> that sounds extremely bizarro-good
[10:23:28] <johnbender> Wilto: it's like a 1 in 20 chance
[10:23:28] <Wilto> How the hell would that be happening..?
[10:23:35] <Wilto> oh god
[10:23:44] <johnbender> Wilto: well we know that the browser doesn't always fire events on the same element :/
[10:24:03] <johnbender> if I hit the border it could be that it's firing on something else
[10:24:10] <johnbender> err
[10:24:11] <johnbender> well
[10:24:18] <johnbender> actually I take that back
[10:24:27] <johnbender> because we bind at the document level o.o
[10:24:37] <johnbender> it just doesn't fire the click ...
[10:25:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^^
[10:25:29] <johnbender> this is in 4.1 mind you
[10:27:43] <Wilto> [obligatory Android curse]
[10:28:03] <johnbender> Wilto: maybe it's being swallowed by vclick or something
[10:28:07] <johnbender> going to play around a bit
[10:28:15] <Wilto> Godspeed, sir.

[10:36:34] <gnarf> johnbender: whats up with code.jquery.com/mobile/nightlies --- do we really need to be pushing these to the CDN?
[10:36:34] <johnbender> gnarf: yo!
[10:36:46] <johnbender> gnarf: I asked the same question, the response I got was "yes"
[10:37:05] <gnarf> anything more than "yes" ?
[10:37:06] <gnarf>  :)
[10:37:07] <jzaefferer> did you add "14gig"?
[10:37:23] <johnbender> gnarf: I don't remember why honestly
[10:37:30] <jzaefferer> or whatever gnarf wrote in that ticket...
[10:37:33] <johnbender> gnarf: if you want I can bring it up at the next meeting
[10:37:40] <gnarf> please
[10:37:41] <gnarf> its 14 gigs
[10:37:44] <johnbender> gnarf: will do
[10:38:02] <gnarf> not sure why you would need yesterdays build, ever
[10:38:29] <Wilto> To reminisce.
[10:38:38] * johnbender shrugs
[10:38:39] <Wilto> “Remember that commit? Ah, but we were young, then…”

[10:44:04] <johnbender> even after using xmonad for more than two years now I sometimes get my app switching keybindings mixed up with my screen switching keybindings
[10:59:02] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: I'm going to kill the popup-simple branch
[11:02:04] <Wilto> It will be missed.
[11:03:38] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[11:04:17] <johnbender> there we g o
[11:05:34] <Wilto> aww yiss
[11:28:02] <Wilto> Alright, so, what’s the plan.
[11:29:27] <johnbender> Wilto: for?
[11:40:35] <Wilto> I’unno, in general. Are we locking this thing down as of now?
[11:41:31] <johnbender> Wilto: that's what it sounded like from Todd
[11:44:28] <Wilto> Cool; didn’t know if you were still working on anything. I’m gonna dig in on this “popup taller than viewport” issue; maybe I’ll just chuck it in a branch for now.
[11:44:30] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[11:44:31] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #43: FIXED in 8 min 5 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/43/
[11:44:52] <johnbender> Wilto: thats a good idea :)
[11:45:30] <Wilto> Meantime, I’m gonna grab the keys to @jquerymobile and put the word out that popups were refactored somewhat, that the community might test the hell out of ’em.
[11:45:57] <johnbender> Wilto: that would also be really good
[11:51:08] <Wilto> also if you have any favorite swear words please tell me now so i can tweet them all
[11:51:23] <Wilto> don’t tell toddmparker_
[12:39:09] <ryanneufeld> hey guys, http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-collapsible.html <- v1.2 correct?
[12:40:02] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: correct
[12:40:07] <ryanneufeld> thanks johnbender
[13:14:41] <Wilto> …uh oh.
[13:14:45] <Wilto> johnbender, you still around?
[13:27:15] <johnbender> Wilto: I am
[13:27:21] <johnbender> about to head out to lunch with my wife
[13:27:24] <johnbender> what's up?
[13:27:42] <johnbender> Wilto: something we missed?
[13:28:00] <Wilto> Something is rotten in the state of jquery.mobile.navigation.js
[13:28:08] <Wilto> He said, with no small measure of horror.
[13:28:15] <Wilto> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html, open a popup, hit reload.
[13:28:31] <Wilto> I think I can track it down; just wanted to see if this rung any bells.
[13:29:28] <johnbender> Wilto: it should be an easy fix
[13:29:35] <johnbender> though I'm not sure why this crops up here and not with dialogs
[13:29:37] <johnbender> let me check
[13:29:55] <Wilto> Eh, I can handle it if you’re headed out the door.
[13:30:08] <johnbender> happens with dialogs too
[13:30:12] <johnbender> it's in the page init
[13:30:32] <johnbender> jquery.mobile.init.js
[13:30:34] <johnbender> initializePage
[13:30:53] <johnbender> $.mobile.path.isHashValid should probably be kicking that out
[13:31:29] <johnbender> Wilto: it's because of the line $( location.hash + ":jqmData(role=page)" )
[13:31:39] <johnbender> the dialog state hash makes sizzle vomit
[13:31:44] <johnbender> Wilto: hmm
[13:31:55] <johnbender> Wilto: try it locally with 1.7
[13:32:01] <johnbender> it might be a sizzle bug
[13:32:11] * kinblas jots down sizzling vomit
[13:32:18] <Wilto> notes
[13:32:20] <johnbender> kinblas: lol
[13:32:21] <Wilto> noted*
[13:32:31] <johnbender> Wilto: in fact I guarantee that's what it is
[13:32:34] <kinblas> good name for a band
[13:32:42] <johnbender> kinblas: hardcore? punk?
[13:32:48] <johnbender> hardcore punk?
[13:32:53] <kinblas> johnbender: lounge
[13:32:55] * johnbender knows fuckall about rock genres
[13:32:58] <Wilto> Yeah; rolling things back didn’t seem to have any effect.
[13:33:04] <Wilto> kinblas: Ironic lounge. I like it.
[13:33:16] <johnbender> Wilto: it still fails in 1.7.2?
[13:33:19] <johnbender> with
[13:33:27] <Wilto> Oh, just rolling back nav changes, I mean.
[13:33:49] <johnbender> Wilto: go into the docs index and change the version of jquery to jquery-1.7.2.js
[13:33:53] <johnbender> going to try it myself real quick
[13:34:26] <Wilto> Yep, okay now.
[13:35:30] <Wilto> DAMMIT, SIZZLE
[13:36:40] <johnbender> Wilto: I would log a bug and then we have to patch initializePage to chuck that out when the dialog hash key is in the hash
[13:36:45] <johnbender> :/
[13:36:56] <johnbender> though we have a ton of code to support that use case
[13:37:01] <johnbender> err
[13:37:02] <johnbender> nevermind
[13:37:05] <johnbender> it's outside that branch
[13:37:13] <johnbender> so we just need to avoid selecting with the dialog hash key
[13:37:58] <johnbender> Wilto: heading out
[13:38:12] <Wilto> Cool; on it.
[14:49:58] <ryanneufeld> anyone alive in here?
[14:53:49] <Wilto> Hanging by a thread, but yes.
[15:03:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto created 1.8-sizzle-navfix (+1 new commit): http://git.io/Ukp4DA
[15:03:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.8-sizzle-navfix] Prevents Sizzle error in `initializePage` due to unescaped characters. Can be reproduced by triggering a popup or dialog, then immediately reloading the page: the result is a loading spinner and no page. - Mat Marquis
[15:03:21] <Wilto> Yeeeeah…
[15:03:51] <Wilto> johnbender: As usual, you’re my only hope. See commit above.
[15:06:39] <Wilto> Confirmed with one Mr. Timmywil: Sizzle is now more strict about unescaped characters, by design.
[16:06:19] <johnbender> Wilto: you around?
[16:08:50] <johnbender> Wilto: it appears to work as long as the hash isn't just the dialog hash key
[16:09:17] <johnbender> that is

[18:52:52] <Wilto> johnbender: Yeah. I had to escape the `=` too.
[18:52:57] <Wilto> You see the branch I pushed?
[20:51:13] <johnbender> Wilto: I saw the commit
[20:51:25] <johnbender> Wilto: I don't know what else to do there
[20:52:04] <johnbender> Wilto: we should honestly be sanitizing those things anyway
[20:52:28] <johnbender> just feeding whatever bullshit comes in on the hash to the selector engine is bad practice
[23:04:26] <johnbender> gseguin: up late I see :)
