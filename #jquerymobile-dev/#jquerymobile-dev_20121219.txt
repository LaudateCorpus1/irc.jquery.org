[02:11:09] <_|Nix|_> Morning ...
[02:13:03] <Changsuk> Hi~
[02:14:37] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Hi, _|Nix|_.
[02:16:03] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: How are yu after our talking last friday?
[02:16:17] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: :)
[02:17:05] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: I send yu and Todd an email, if you can please read and give me your ideas. :)
[02:40:52] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Old build #114: STILL UNSTABLE in 39 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/114/
[02:41:39] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: OK.
[02:47:14] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I have started a branch in web-ui-fw to port widgets over to be even more like jQM (stop using less, stop using HTML protos, start using AMD, use jQM as a submodule, etc.)
[02:49:22] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I haven't pushed it yet, because it's still very early on ... I'm converting some of the abstract widgets to jQM behaviours ...
[02:49:28] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I've started with the colour widgets.
[02:49:56] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I'm going to use jQuery.Color, because that seems to have a lot of the features from the colour library that we created.
[03:13:40] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Color widgets? It's cool~~~. :)
[03:14:30] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: and I'm sorry, I just sent you and Todd an email a minute ago.
[03:15:50] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: I think that there is a similar widget in Tizen web-ui-fw. do yu know?
[03:16:20] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: There is a whole set of colour widgets in tizen web-ui-fw.
[03:16:48] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Once I get the jqm branch up and running, we should slowly move all the widgets to that branch, because that one will be exactly like jQM.
[03:17:21] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: We'll also have to set up the unit tests and API docs the way jQM has them.
[03:17:23] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: yes, i think so.
[03:17:27] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: It's quite a big job.
[03:17:46] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: yes, right.
[03:17:53] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I think the first step should be to have the code structured similarly to jQM.
[03:18:05] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Then the unit tests, and the API docs.
[03:18:53] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I've started with the colorpalette, because it's a simple widget, but it needs a lot of infrastructure.
[03:19:14] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: yes, I think my team do the same work to move Tizen widgets which will be added.
[03:19:37] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: I see.
[03:19:59] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: anyway, did yu see the my team's widgets?
[03:20:03] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I can ask my manager if you guys can get commit access to GH web-ui-fw. Then I'll push the jqm branch, and, if it all works out, we can work inside that branch.
[03:20:35] <Changsuk> Ok, Thanks so much.
[03:20:37] <Changsuk> :)
[03:21:06] <Changsuk> Hyunsook and Kangsik will put them to web-ui-fw GH.
[03:21:14] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I saw the demo you put up last Friday, and I rolled a copy of web-ui-fw from tizen.org here: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/web-ui-fw/demos/tizen-winsets
[03:21:26] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: OK. I'll give him a call.
[03:21:39] <Changsuk> After yu done the job, let me know via email or here. :)
[03:24:22] <Changsuk> Wow~! All of three widgets are adaped well~~! Thanks so much. :)
[03:24:42] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: lOl :)
[03:28:04] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: I check tizen.org git server web page. It hasn't be managed well. So when yu need a newest widget codes or something, pls email me or Hyunsook.
[03:35:56] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I've spoken to my manager
[03:36:06] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: He said it's OK for you to have commit access.
[03:36:18] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Thank you~!! Gabriel. :)
[03:36:21] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: However, we cannot work on master for now.
[03:36:36] <Changsuk> Ok, I see.
[03:36:39] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: We have to work on a branch called "jqm", which I will push when I have one working widget.
[03:36:59] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: ok.
[03:37:06] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: We will put our widgets in there, complete with demos and unit tests, and we will merge with master when we're relatively stable.
[03:37:57] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Remember also that we should follow the same policy as jQM regarding big changes: Even with commit access, we should make a branch, push the large changes there, and create an internal PR.
[03:38:18] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Then, we all look at the PR, and the one who created it gets the pleasure of pushing the big green button when we all say OK.
[03:39:01] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Of course, this will become much more important when we start having lots of users who expect stability even from master.
[03:39:33] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: Ok, I got it, and Do you need my members' accounts to connect Git server?
[03:40:23] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Yeah. I need Kangsik's and HyunSook's GH username.
[03:40:35] <_|Nix|_> s/S/s/
[03:41:33] <Changsuk> yes, but actually today is a national holiday. so they are off today.
[03:42:20] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I found a person named "kangsik" on GH. Is that him?
[03:42:20] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: I'll send an email to them and make them email to you tomorrow.
[03:42:54] <_|Nix|_> I also found a person named "hyunsook" whose name is Hyunsook Park.
[03:43:02] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: OK. Let's do it that way.
[03:43:17] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I'll write up an email about how we should work together in GH.
[03:43:32] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: It's great to have you guys on board!
[03:43:38] <Changsuk> _|Nix|_: I think so... but... I'm uncertain.
[03:43:49] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Let's make web-ui-fw awesome :)
[03:44:17] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I think your way is better. Have them send me an email with their GH usernames, and we can add them to the committers for web-ui-fw.
[03:44:33] <Changsuk> _Nix_: your welcome~ :) I also please to work with you and your team.
[03:45:08] <uGoMobi> ?tell toddmparker : see this comment https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3712#issuecomment-11526581 ... was wondering if selects will work in panels on Android 2.3 assuming we will still force hardware acceleration there after the refactor
[03:45:09] <bot-t> uGoMobi, Okay.
[03:45:19] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: OK. I'm going to go have some lunch now, and hopefully by the end of the day I can finish and push "jqm" to web-ui-fw. Then, we'll see tomomrrow.
[03:45:26] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: TTYL
[03:45:38] <Changsuk> _Nix_: yes, make web-ui-fw the best in the world. :)
[03:45:48] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Enjoy (the rest of) your holiday!
[03:46:31] <Changsuk> _Nix_: Have a nice lunch~ See you soon~ :)

[05:02:16] <arschmitz> Morning uGoMobi: _|Nix|_:
[05:02:27] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:03:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you see the changes to range for disabled?
[05:03:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, I pulled them... thanks
[05:04:01] <arschmitz> not sure whats up with the transparent handles 
[05:04:19] <arschmitz> i started looking into it but got caught up with other stuff
[05:04:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it is because the rangeslider is two sliders on top of eachother and both 30% opacity
[05:04:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will take care of it
[05:05:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: solution is most probably to add class ui-disabled to the wrapper div, not to the sliders
[05:05:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i see
[05:05:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: there is also an issue with rangeslider on IE7... z-index ignored or something
[05:06:12] <arschmitz> weird it was working before when todd tested
[05:06:23] <arschmitz> oh uGoMobi: wp7 or 7.5?
[05:06:31] <uGoMobi> IE7
[05:06:39] <uGoMobi> not WP7/7.5
[05:06:41] <arschmitz> ohhhh
[05:06:42] <arschmitz> lol
[05:06:47] <uGoMobi> which is mostly based on IE8
[05:07:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah or ie9 for 7.5
[05:07:16] <uGoMobi> yeah correct
[05:07:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill take a look at it
[05:07:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am already working on it
[05:08:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok cool
[05:08:44] <arschmitz> its not coming to me right now but isnt there a bug in ie7 regarding z-index?
[05:08:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am making changes to CSS so to avoid conflicts probably easier if fix it
[05:09:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: probably lol
[05:09:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: something to do with the parent
[05:09:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe "zoom: 1;" (hasLayout) will do the trick again ;)
[05:10:15] <uGoMobi> so many issues you can fix with that lol
[05:10:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its true
[05:11:12] <arschmitz> the day i dont need to make a special inline-block class i will be SOOOO excited lol
[05:11:23] <uGoMobi> haha
[05:11:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the day we stop supporting IE7 will make me even more excited :D
[05:12:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im pretty sure thats the same day lol
[05:12:14] <uGoMobi> hahaha
[05:21:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think this is the problem in ie7 http://therealcrisp.xs4all.nl/meuk/IE-zindexbug.html
[05:24:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good morning!
[05:24:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Morning
[05:25:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sounds like you have a good think going with changsuk i think thats a great way to handle their widget will be awesome all on its own
[05:31:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: had a question for you. when we do a demo of a third party widget should we include the widget in the view source or just have a link to its git hub?
[05:32:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. I'm starting on branch on web-ui-fw with a totally different infrastructure. jQM is a submodule, so I can make requirejs references to all the jQM submodules from outside.
[05:33:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I'll slowly bring in each widget one at a time, making it a module.
[05:33:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and there'll be lots of goodies for the widget review in there.
[05:34:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm hoping to obsolete a lot of the code in there when we're done with the widget review ...
[05:34:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and migrate those widgets over to whatever we end up implementing here.
[05:35:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For example, things like option demultiplexing.
[05:35:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah that will be awesome i think while some of the widget from the samsung guys arnt nessasarrily ones that make sense for the main library like the multibutton but is a great widget but probably not for the main library
[05:35:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you gonna include the 3rd party plugin script or can you link to CDN?
[05:36:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not sure i was asking in a more general sense lol
[05:36:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think we should have links to third-party demo pages.
[05:36:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe best to include script on page and then include it in view source too
[05:36:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it will be a super robust set of widget it sounds like espically a lot for people doing apps / sites
[05:37:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I hope so.
[05:37:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Your view source plugin might end up a widget on its own :)
[05:37:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im talking about demos we want for the demo docs where we will be making the demo but its for a third party widget
[05:37:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: downside of linking to external is that we have to keep updating the demo each time the 3rd party plugin releases a new version
[05:38:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono. I'm talking links like http://jquerymobile.com/docs/demos
[05:38:19] <uGoMobi> that's why I think I prefer static code
[05:38:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... only for the third-party top-level demo page.
[05:38:55] <uGoMobi> we can link to the plugin website
[05:38:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Unless you really want to pull it all in and make it searchable from a single place.
[05:39:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: my only question about including in viewsource is it could make the viewsource really long for something that they dont care to see only copy or download 
[05:39:28] <uGoMobi> but the script used for the demo itself should be static and therefor also be included in the source view
[05:39:54] <uGoMobi> so people can see what version of the 3rd party plugin we used and what that code looks like
[05:40:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh but we can do multiple view source on a page now right
[05:40:32] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: view source scrolls very nicely ;)
[05:40:38] <_|Nix|_> OK. I'm confused. My idea is that I create something like http://web-ui-fw.github.com/docs/demos which has the exact same structure as http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos ...
[05:40:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: everything is possible :D
[05:40:59] <arschmitz> so can just have a seperate button for the widget vs addition stuff
[05:41:08] <_|Nix|_> ... and then somewhere within jquerymobile.com there is a link to http://web-ui-fw.github.com/docs/demos ...
[05:41:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: sorry 2 different conversations colliding 
[05:41:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: aha now i get you... you mean the whole demo outside our own docs
[05:41:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, and we simply point to it.
[05:41:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz was talking about a demo that is in our own docs/demos
[05:41:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi and i are talking about just demos we are making our selves
[05:42:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We maintain a common look and feel, which jQM defines, and other libraries follow.
[05:42:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Other libraries such as web-ui-fw.
[05:42:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes sorry i wasent talking about web-ui-ffw at all this is about our demos 
[05:42:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[05:43:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I dunno about that... if we want to show a demo how JQM works with a specific plugin I think it might be better if we keep control
[05:43:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, for sure.
[05:43:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now I get it.
[05:43:18] <arschmitz> sorry got confusing because i was talking to you about web-ui-fw and uGoMobi: about other demos at the same time ha ha
[05:43:54] <_|Nix|_> My head is spinning IRL too, so this is fitting.
[05:44:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: people expect all scripts used in a demo to be visible in the view source
[05:44:10] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:44:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i wasent thinking we could have seperate buttons for different parts of the source now
[05:44:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you use script but don't show it in the view source they might not understand where certain behaviour comes from
[05:44:53] <arschmitz> but since we can it makes it simple
[05:45:02] <uGoMobi> great
[05:45:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What about including a collapsible titled "LINKS"
[05:45:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... which, when opened, contains links to the js/css of the plugin.
[05:45:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe even some freeform text ...
[05:45:58] <arschmitz> i was pictureing a super long widget being cramed in with other custom stuff and it would be hard to differentiate between the two to people that dont know js very well
[05:46:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: yeah, for sure. The code for a widget can be huge.
[05:46:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... even if the widget seems simple.
[05:46:42] <_|Nix|_> *cough* popup *cough*
[05:46:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah for sure but thats why it will just have its very own view source
[05:47:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think the downside is that it isn't static.. if a 3rd party plugin moves their repo or something things get broken
[05:47:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess that's true. OTOH, we're commiting ourselves to distributing third party plugins.
[05:47:52] <uGoMobi> on a intro page of a demo we can have a "resources" section with links to the 3rd party plugin website/repo
[05:47:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm not saying that's bad and to be avoided - I'm just realizing that that's one of the consequences.
[05:48:07] <arschmitz> i think we should link to the stuff for the actual original authors git hub demo page etc
[05:48:22] <arschmitz> we want to give the original author all the props we can
[05:48:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's what I was saying for the view source collapsible. Have one called "resources" ...
[05:48:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I agree, but I think I would prefer to keep that out of the source view
[05:48:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes for sure
[05:49:07] <arschmitz> i just meant in general on the page not in view source
[05:49:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Fine. WORKSFORME, especially since the source view currently expects plain text in all its collapsibles :)
[05:49:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, small difference is that I wouldn't include it in the view source popup a collapsible, but on the page itself
[05:49:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lol
[05:49:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Absolutely. +1
[05:50:55] <uGoMobi> In general I think it's important that we keep all docs/demos as low maintenance as possible
[05:51:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You are reciting canon :)
[05:51:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I have to look that up ;)
[06:04:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do you think it might be possible to split the view source thing out of jqm-demos.js?
[06:04:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I might want to use it in web-ui-fw ... 
[06:04:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But I guess I can just copy it ...
[06:05:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, we could do a combine.php thing like we do with js/index.php ...
[06:05:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure, then we just have to add a link to the script in the head of each demo page
[06:05:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true
[06:05:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm just thinking about reducing HTTP requests.
[06:06:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, _assets/js/{jqm-demos.js,viewSource.js,index.php} ...
[06:06:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and then <script src="_assets/js"></script>
[06:06:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or rather <script src="_assets/js/"></script>
[06:06:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: could that give problems when people look at the docs in the zip file?
[06:06:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i think thats a great idea
[06:07:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... that's a good point. That only works with a Web server ...
[06:07:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: think so too
[06:07:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If the demos are to be viewable offline, that won't work.
[06:07:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Are the demos intended to be viewable offline?
[06:07:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[06:07:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why not the docs work just fine with that method already?
[06:08:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The old docs are designed to be viewed through a Web server ...
[06:08:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can download a zip file with the library and the docs
[06:08:20] <uGoMobi> for each release
[06:08:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but doesn't docs/demos/ include <script src="../../../js/"></script>
[06:08:50] <_|Nix|_> ?
[06:08:56] <uGoMobi> we have some code in the docs because Ajax might not wor
[06:08:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If so, it's not viewable offline.
[06:09:00] <uGoMobi> work*
[06:09:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right isnt it going to be the same as docs?
[06:09:40] <arschmitz> when did we decide to make it work without a local werbserver?
[06:09:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The demos currently won't work offline, because, for example, docs/demos/index.html includes <script src="../../js/"></script>
[06:09:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, new docs & demos are going to be the same as our current docs... just other content
[06:10:07] <arschmitz> ok then this will work all the same places
[06:10:14] <arschmitz> its the same thing we already do
[06:10:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and ../../js/ requires PHP to work.
[06:10:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: don't relative paths work offline?
[06:10:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They do, but including a directory has no effect, right?
[06:10:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah, right
[06:11:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: get it... that directory has a php script
[06:11:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Exactly.
[06:11:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right
[06:11:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: YOu could create a grunt target or something, but then people need to use grunt.
[06:11:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think web devs should have access to a Web server :)
[06:11:59] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:11:59] <arschmitz> i think it should be just like we do for js/
[06:12:01] <uGoMobi> i agree
[06:12:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I think using PHP is not such a big leap.
[06:12:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they already need it for the demos to work so its just using it 2 places vs 1
[06:13:15] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[06:13:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Anyway, it's not a big priority because for now I don't need it. I'm just trying to get one widget up and running and I'm nowhere near a demo.
[06:14:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: on the other hand... we could change the way we create that zip file and include complete script
[06:14:37] <uGoMobi> but that might be some work
[06:14:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That does not preclude using PHP in two places.
[06:14:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I meant not using PHP anymore
[06:15:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know.
[06:15:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What I'm saying is that the method that makes js/index.php unnecessary can also be used to make _assets/js/index.php unnecessary.
[06:15:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so yes, probably fine to use PHP to combine demos JS and view source JS
[06:15:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: gotcha
[06:15:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I think so too.
[06:16:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Cool! So, when I get ot that point, I'll do the split and the PHP.
[06:16:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great

[11:40:57] <johnbender> my experiments thus far have been encouraging :)
[11:45:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: popup has a mode where the transition is intentionally enabled.
[11:45:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm just setting the defaultPageTransition to none
[11:45:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's because there are timing issues when transitions do not complete immediately. Sync vs. async, that sort of thing.
[11:45:56] <johnbender> so that shouldn't affect it
[11:46:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. That's fine.
[11:46:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Default popup transition is none, anyway.
[11:46:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Just be aware that that might also hide async issues.
[11:46:32] <johnbender> indeed
[11:46:39] <johnbender> that was my original argument
[11:46:49] <johnbender> against doing this
[11:46:55] <johnbender> but we can be selective about it too
[11:47:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can we override transition times with CSS?
[11:47:13] <johnbender> no
[11:47:29] <johnbender> well
[11:47:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Why not? Is that not themeable?
[11:47:35] <johnbender> that's not entirey true
[11:47:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we'd just have to rewrite the animation completely
[11:48:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Could we create a unit test theme?
[11:48:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: complete with fast animations?
[11:48:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: then we're not testing the transition times in our theme
[11:48:35] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and we do occasionally catch css issues in tests
[11:48:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Ideally, we should have a second theme with really slow animations.
[11:48:40] <johnbender> because of wierd interactions
[11:48:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Exactly.

[13:03:34] <toddmparker> man, almost there with panel debugging. was brutal once we added in fixed header support. so many bugs.
[13:04:07] <toddmparker> it's all functional across the board and south on better browsers
[13:04:28] <toddmparker> we're using the 3D test for animated panels so if no 3D, we just hide/show
[13:04:56] <toddmparker> zach is going to work on destroy and unit tests after we wrap
[13:05:10] <toddmparker>  we will do more debugging post-beta but this should be solid

[13:12:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm yeah i know the problem ill come up with a fix
[13:13:16] <arschmitz> its because of the way it selects the closes handle

[13:31:18] <johnbender> toddmparker: nope
[13:31:24] <johnbender> those are problems with the latest jquery
[13:31:43] <johnbender> and I think 1.9 is going to come out before we release so we had better deal with it
[13:32:04] <johnbender> should be easy to fix though
[13:32:10] <johnbender> they're completely reproducible 
[13:32:52] <johnbender> toddmparker: we're going to have to figure something out with the deprecations in core

[13:33:46] <toddmparker> i'm good with either approach. maybe you can size it up and we'll discuss tomorrow?
[13:33:59] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yep, selects are hosed in panels in 2.3
[13:37:14] <toddmparker> even a pure native select
[13:37:26] <johnbender> toddmparker: hmm I might be wrong
[13:37:29] <uGoMobi> toddmparker:  :(
[13:37:30] <johnbender> looking into it
[13:41:01] <toddmparker> k
[13:41:29] <toddmparker> yeah, it's just android. it's not like a native select is ok and our custom one is broken. they are just fragile.
[13:41:40] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: adding a note the panel docs

[13:58:30] <johnbender> uGoMobi: not sure what you mean
[13:58:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ah
[13:59:07] <johnbender> the widget factory has a built in notion of disabled
[13:59:11] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ticket maybe?
[13:59:15] <johnbender> for 1.4
[13:59:16] <johnbender> ?
[13:59:25] <uGoMobi> johnbender: something like this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/slider.js#L475
[13:59:39] <johnbender> coo
[14:00:23] <uGoMobi> johnbender: but if it is built in... why do we use _setOption there?
[14:00:36] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I think it's tied to that 
[14:00:41] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I have to look at the widget factory to understand how it works
[14:00:45] <johnbender> _setOption does quite a lot I believe
[14:01:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: maybe now the widget factory only set aria attribute or something
