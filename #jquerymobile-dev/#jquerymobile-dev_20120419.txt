[06:31:28] <_|Nix|__> Bah!
[06:44:39] <deAtog> fyi, the announcement for 1.1.0 here: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/04/13/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-1-0/ says "Download 1.0 Zip"
[07:18:30] <Wilto> Don’t call it a comeback.
[07:24:01] <Wilto> What’d I miss? You guys fix All The Things™?
[07:26:25] <deAtog> Wilto: it's a work in progress
[07:26:33] <Wilto> ?mlm
[07:26:33] <bot-t> much like myself
[08:11:37] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Could you please merge master into popup-widget again?
[08:23:40] * _|Nix|_ waves hands frantically about
[08:34:58] <Wilto> OVER MY DEAD BODY
[08:35:26] <_|Nix|_> Wha ... ?
[08:35:29] <_|Nix|_> What's wrongs?
[08:35:37] <Wilto> Nah, just screwing around—no worries, dude.
[08:35:50] <_|Nix|_> *phew* ...
[08:35:54] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Is this holding you up? I’m taking a snow-shovel to my inbox at the moment, after a couple of days away.
[08:36:06] <Wilto> Okay if I merge things in an hour or so?
[08:36:17] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I've checked and it merged cleanly.
[08:36:29] <Wilto> Easy-peasy, then. On it.
[08:47:15] <Wilto> Woah, I jinxed myself.
[08:47:45] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: What happened?
[08:47:58] <Wilto> Ah, just forgot we’ve been merging and not rebasing on this sucker.
[08:48:02] <Wilto> Five minutes, dude.
[08:48:09] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: NP. Thanks!
[08:51:50] <Wilto> Drumroll please.
[08:52:15] <_|Nix|_> Niceness!
[08:52:20] <Wilto> Look okay on your side
[08:52:21] <Wilto> ?
[08:53:01] <_|Nix|_> Looks good, but I don't get one thing: how come there's never a link to the actual commit?
[08:53:52] <_|Nix|_> Maybe I'm not doing something right. I mean, I can never see the actual commit from master that was merged into popup-widget.
[08:54:59] <Wilto> Oh, no idea.
[08:55:06] <_|Nix|_> No, wait. I'm blind.
[08:55:25] <Wilto> Ah, okay, cool. I was gonna say, maybe I did things extra right by accident?
[08:57:31] <_|Nix|_> Nah, it's all good. Splendid, old chap!
[09:01:28] <gseguin> good morning all
[09:01:52] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: Sorry I just got to my desk, seems like you figured out why I backed out that PR
[09:01:53] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hey!
[09:01:55] <Wilto> Whassup, G-Unit.
[09:02:18] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, but I got another one in its place that does things differently, and hopefully better.
[09:02:36] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Actually ran the tests on it, and everything was fine.
[09:02:54] <gseguin> gUnit sounds like a good name for a test framework
[09:03:07] * gseguin is forking qUnit
[09:03:15] <_|Nix|_> :)
[09:04:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: This new PR (#4117) actually has some stuff that's useful for popup-widget as well.
[09:06:10] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: will look at it shortly
[09:09:21] <gseguin> Wilto: did you do that merge?
[09:09:28] <Wilto> Yessir.
[09:09:36] <gseguin> cool! thanks

[09:32:28] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I haven't played with the popup-widget branch in a while
[09:32:37] <gseguin> is it in good shape?
[09:32:45] <Wilto> ?mum
[09:32:45] <bot-t> much unlike myself
[09:33:29] <gseguin> Wilto: the playing with the branch part or the being in good shape?
[09:33:48] <Wilto> The “good shape” part. I gotta start doing some push-ups over here.
[09:34:16] <gseguin> heh
[09:34:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think popup-widget really needs popup-stack-management, but, since you just merged that PR, I think I'll re-word the popup-stack-management on top of the nav change I made.
[09:34:44] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Oh, crap ... need another merge of master into popup-widget to make use of that :)
[09:34:55] <gseguin> I can do that
[09:34:59] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Thanks!
[09:36:41] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: done

[09:36:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] Merge branch 'master' into popup-widget - Ghislain Seguin
[09:37:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Thanks!
[09:42:13] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think the popup stack management can now go into popup-widget as well ... aside from #4097, which also affects dialogs, I don't think it suffers from any other issues ...
[09:42:28] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: (#3653)
[09:43:22] <_|Nix|_> I'll run the tests again, just in case, but I'm thinking that popup-widget will need a whole bunch of unit tests for all those cases that we've been doing - like show popup then refresh, go to another page from popup, open a bunch of popups then hit back, ...
[09:43:23] <gseguin> weren't we hesitating on that one?
[09:43:58] <gseguin> as in whether it was a good idea to provide such a tool
[09:44:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah - we were waiting for me to test it against the latest master in case some changes to the navigation broke it, but I just did the manual testing and it looks OK.
[09:45:18] <gseguin> let's talk about it in the meeting today
[09:45:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I have reduced the incursions into the navigation by getting rid of the direct history manipulation. i.e., the "fairly ugly things" I mention in the PR comments have been reduced.
[09:45:28] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK.
[09:46:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll make one unit test for the PR you just merged, and then I'll start to make some unit tests for the popup stack management, so I don't have to do all those tests by hand everytime I rebase against master.
[09:47:25] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: sounds good
[09:54:13] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: #2656 should now be closed, right?
[09:59:15] <Wilto> gseguin: Clever, clever. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/c64c1a4bd22519dec48f687f5cb2fc757c7dfb13
[09:59:15] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (16h, 8m ago): Use $.mobile.version for version ribbon
[09:59:38] <Wilto> Fixing that overflow issue in a bit; still trying to get above water in my inbox.
[09:59:50] <gseguin> Wilto: version should be in one and only one place
[10:00:02] <Wilto> +100
[10:00:15] <Wilto> Shame toddmparker_ is out of a job now, though.
[10:00:18] <Wilto> ?os
[10:00:19] <bot-t> oh snao™
[10:00:20] <gseguin> otherwise we *will* screw it up
[10:00:31] <Wilto> I know I would.
[10:00:32] <gseguin> ouch!
[10:00:50] <Wilto> BUUURN
[10:01:02] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yes I'll close it
[10:20:51] <_|Nix|_> How do I run just one unit test?
[10:21:02] <_|Nix|_> If I run tests/unit/navigation, it runs a whole slew ...
[10:21:19] <_|Nix|_> Can I run tests/unit/navigation/#testnumber?
[10:29:44] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: if you wait until the suite has finished running, then double click on the test title that you want to run
[10:30:59] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... and if I make changes to the test code and re-run will it only re-run that one test?
[10:31:12] <gseguin> when you refresh yes
[10:31:21] <gseguin> it adds a ?filter= to the url
[10:31:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Awesome!
[10:31:29] <_|Nix|_> Aha!
[10:31:33] <_|Nix|_> Cool ...
[10:44:14] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... is there a way to tell the test to wait a specified amount?
[10:44:42] <gseguin> before what?
[10:44:46] <_|Nix|_> I find that I click on the dialog's "Close" button, and then I check whether the dialog.is(":visible"), and I'm getting true.
[10:45:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I mean, does the testing framework provide a utility function for waiting a certain amount of time before proceeding with the test?
[10:45:33] <_|Nix|_> s/the test/the rest of the test/
[10:45:44] <gseguin> so if you make it an asyncTest
[10:45:52] <gseguin> and then you do a setTimeout
[10:46:01] <gseguin> and in your callback you call start()
[10:46:14] <gseguin> which will start the actual test
[10:47:28] <_|Nix|_> That's one thing I don't actually get. The last function in the list of functions that comprise an asyncTest always consists of a check and then start().
[10:47:42] <_|Nix|_> But how can the check be executed before the test even starts?
[10:49:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's telling the test suite to start up again, that is start the next test
[10:49:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, OK :)
[10:50:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you can recreate the asyncTest helper with test("foo", function(){ stop(); /* run some test code */ start(); });
[10:50:33] <johnbender> the purpose is to serialize the test suite in the face of async actions that would otherwise let the test suite execution take place
[10:51:23] <Wilto> I should also mention that :visible is crazy gross, performance-wise.
[10:51:37] <Wilto> It checks for, like… display, visibility, height, width, a bunch of stuff.
[10:51:57] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Aha, OK ... so, what's the best way to check that a dialog is off the screen after having clicked the "Close" button in the header?
[10:52:05] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: If you know for certain what method being used to hide it, I’d check for that specifically.
[10:52:20] <Wilto> Like, left: -9999px style?
[10:52:35] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: No idea. I just click the "Close" button and away it goes.
[10:52:49] <Wilto> Oh, oh, sorry, I know what you mean now.
[10:52:59] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: But, considering that it's a dialog, it's a page, so it should no longer be the active page.
[10:53:06] <Wilto> Yep, exactly.
[10:53:14] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So I can check for $.mobile.activePage != the dialog ...
[10:53:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's generally the way we do it, though that does depend on the activePage being set properly
[10:53:47] <johnbender> don't overthink it though
[10:53:52] <johnbender> that will work fine
[10:53:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ping
[10:55:44] <_|Nix|_> Niceness ... test looking good now ...

[10:58:52] <toddparker> party time
[11:30:15] <Wilto> Mad randos up ins.
[11:37:31] <johnbender> for serious
[11:37:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I added you to my circle - I think.
[11:39:43] <gseguin> johnbender: where are you?
[11:39:44] <johnbender> gseguin: have you started yet?
[11:39:46] <kborchers> gseguin: please add me if you don't mind
[11:39:49] <johnbender> I'm not seeing it in my feed
[11:39:50] <gseguin> are you not coming back
[11:39:51] <gseguin> ?
[11:39:58] <gseguin> kborchers: sorry about that
[11:40:32] <kborchers> no problem, thanks
[11:40:45] <gseguin> johnbender: I'll send you another invite
[11:40:56] <kborchers> gseguin: i pretty much just listen but like to keep up on what's going on
[11:41:35] <gseguin> yeah that was the goal of the public hangout
[11:41:58] <kborchers> would like to start contributing at some point but UI is keeping me pretty busy :)
[13:37:08] <gseguin> aaaand we're back
[13:37:13] <gseguin> what did I miss?
[14:32:59] <gseguin> so the download builder will not work on Opera
[14:33:16] <gseguin> maybe we should give a friendlier user message
[14:34:00] <gseguin> but I understand well, Opera does not support CORS so it won't work
[14:34:11] <gseguin> s/I/if I/

[14:45:21] <johnbender> this one is going to need some testing :(
[14:53:37] <toddparker> gseguin: i see. so can we show a friendly message to opera users explaining why this won't work?
[14:53:54] <toddparker> is the CORS thing only an issue right now because we need to ping your server?
[14:54:05] <toddparker> once on our server, will it be ok?

[14:54:35] <gseguin> well we could install a proxy rule on the apache server to remediate that
[14:55:52] <gseguin> even if we host it on our hardware, if we don't want to use CORS, we're going to have to set up  a proxy rule
[14:56:07] <gseguin> toddparker: ^

[15:34:37] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[16:50:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I forgot to ask for the jquery square jquery logo png
[16:50:12] <johnbender> Wilto: you know where to get that ?
[16:50:39] <Wilto> johnbender: Got an SVG of it.
[16:50:41] <Wilto> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:JQuery_logo.svg
[16:50:53] <Wilto> Want me to save that sucker down to a png?

[18:54:54] <johnbender> Wilto: yah I was looking for the square one in a png
[18:55:00] <Wilto> Oh, oh.
[18:55:16] <johnbender> Wilto: http://webxtreams.net/images/stories/jquery_logo.jpg
[18:55:21] <johnbender> that but as a png
[18:55:26] <johnbender> transparent bg
[18:56:14] <Wilto> johnbender: http://jquery.org/about/ doesn’t have ’em, either.
[18:58:04] <johnbender> Wilto: yah that's why I'm asking you guys I can't find it anywhere
[18:58:12] <johnbender> Todd said he might have them on the vpn
[18:58:17] <johnbender> last night
[18:58:22] <Wilto> Hah, sorry, that was just kind of a blithering observation. I’m fried.
[18:58:23] <johnbender> but I didn't get him before he went home
[18:59:47] <johnbender> Wilto: I appreciate you and todd helping out though
[18:59:51] <Wilto> Let me ask around a bit.
[19:02:23] <johnbender> Wilto: thanks man, I can also just ping todd again tomorrow
[19:02:27] <johnbender> don't waste any time on it
[19:02:28] <toddmparker_> hi
[19:02:32] <toddmparker_> ears burning
[19:02:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: hey!
[19:02:34] <johnbender> haha
[19:02:44] <toddmparker_> ok, what can i do for you
[19:02:45] <johnbender> I'm pesting wilto, I thought maybe he would know about the logo
[19:02:56] <johnbender> I can just ping you tomorrow too
[19:02:58] <Wilto> I can barely spell “logo.”
[19:03:03] <johnbender> please don't waste any time on it
[19:03:11] <toddmparker_> so can i take one of the logos wilto found and photoshop it to your specs
[19:03:22] <toddmparker_> assuming you use gimp or something
[19:03:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I can do a select by color but that always produces mixed results
[19:03:33] <toddmparker_> you need a real tool for this
[19:03:40] <johnbender> lol I have photoshop
[19:03:42] <Wilto> I wish the hell you could change a single layer to “multiply.”
[19:03:45] <johnbender> and I actually know how to use it quite well
[19:03:55] <johnbender> well
[19:04:02] <johnbender> for a dev at least :P
[19:04:08] <Wilto> But what, indeed, would it multiply against? Photoshop would start throwing NaN at me.
[19:04:14] <toddmparker_> do you want this style lockup? http://webxtreams.net/images/stories/jquery_logo.jpg
[19:04:19] <toddmparker_> what's this for btw?
[19:05:30] <toddmparker_> just grabbed the dvg so the world's my oyster
[19:07:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yep that one, but transparent bg
[19:07:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's for my oopsla poster
[19:07:39] <johnbender> or
[19:07:43] <johnbender> rather the one I'm submitting
[19:07:58] <toddmparker_> so the big swoops stacked on top
[19:07:59] <johnbender> flexing my design skizzils
[19:08:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah
[19:08:14] <johnbender> seriously though you guys have already spent too much time on it
[19:08:16] <toddmparker_> you need this as a bitmap (png)?
[19:08:23] <johnbender> yah
[19:08:25] <johnbender> that would be best
[19:08:28] <toddmparker_> dimensions?
[19:08:35] <johnbender> 320px + would be great
[19:08:39] <johnbender> anything larger is a bonus
[19:08:48] <johnbender> the html5 logo I have is 512px
[19:08:57] <johnbender> anything up to there would be useful
[19:09:19] <johnbender> the poster is 8ft by 4ft so it has to be big enough to render nice and not too small
[19:09:53] <toddmparker_> yeeps
[19:10:05] <toddmparker_> you want way more resolution than 512 px
[19:10:20] <toddmparker_> who's printing this?
[19:10:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I won't print it unless they accept and it's really small at full size
[19:10:44] <johnbender> so 512px is fine
[19:11:08] <toddmparker_> ok
[19:11:28] <toddmparker_> i'm all set up with that lockup in vector so I can bang out whatever size you need
[19:11:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: crazy awesome
[19:12:02] <johnbender> 512px should be fine
[19:12:08] <johnbender> thanks so much for taking the time man
[19:14:04] <toddmparker_> no rpoblem at all
[19:14:14] <toddmparker_> if you ever need help with this kind of stuff, my pleasure
[19:14:18] <toddmparker_> only takes a sec
[19:14:23] <toddmparker_> email you?
[19:16:55] <toddmparker_> johnbender: just emailed you a 600px version, 1,200px version (300dpi) and a PDF so you could zoom it in as needed
[19:17:19] <toddmparker_> pngs are on a transparent bg
[19:18:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: thanks man
[19:18:11] <johnbender> seriously amazing
[19:19:27] <toddmparker_> that that with GIMP sukka
[19:21:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: lol
[19:22:02] * johnbender grumbles something about the command line and skulks away 
[19:22:09] <toddmparker_> random, i just happened to open my laptop just now. fate.
[19:22:33] <johnbender> alright guys I'm going to feed my daughter
[19:22:34] <johnbender> I'll be on later
[19:22:43] <toddmparker_> we'll trade. i'll handle photoshop + illustrator and you do all that scary command line mumbo jumbo
[19:22:52] <toddmparker_> k, g'night johnbender
