[04:24:47] <uGoMobi> AlexSchmitz arschmitz : thanks a lot for all your work on triage!!
[04:55:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi not a problem decided to try to get rid of some old stuff
[05:01:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it takes almost no effort to go through them on the laptop while watching tv at night ha ha!
[05:02:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: :D
[05:02:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker and I always get OCD when doing triage
[05:02:57] <uGoMobi> just can't stop because we want to clean up the issue tracker so badly
[05:04:00] <arschmitz> yeah thats kinda my goal id like to see it under 300 and i figure if i just go though starting with the oldest and try to clear out stuff that can be closed it will happen quickly
[05:04:40] <uGoMobi> yeah with joined forces we should be able to get this below 300
[05:04:48] <arschmitz> and once all that stuff is closed its easier to focus on the real problems
[05:05:14] <arschmitz> i think there are a lot of dups too thats harder to identify though
[05:05:26] <uGoMobi> there are many duplicates and non legit issues in the tracker as well
[05:05:37] <uGoMobi> exactly
[05:06:15] <arschmitz> you were just blowing up my email closing them this morning ha ha
[05:07:06] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:07:28] <arschmitz> all those ones were 10months - a year stale thouugh those arnt helping anyone
[05:09:12] <uGoMobi> yeah, problem is that we still have to check them before closing
[05:09:32] <uGoMobi> still a few that are an issue in latest code
[05:09:33] <arschmitz> oh i know there are plenty just as old that were legit though
[05:09:46] <arschmitz> that i didnt touch
[05:10:52] <arschmitz> i feel like a lot could kinda be consolidated though like there is a lot about downfalls of the navigation model. not really bugs.
[05:14:22] <uGoMobi> we are trying to be more strict about what is accepted as a bug report and what is more a topic for the forum
[05:14:55] <arschmitz> yeah the ones im talking about are all a year + stale too
[05:15:39] <uGoMobi> many tickets are about how to make things work when using 3rd party plugins for example
[05:16:06] <arschmitz> yeah not an issue for us really
[05:17:03] <uGoMobi> point is that although not really bugs we do want to look into it if we can make things work with a change at our end
[05:17:10] <uGoMobi> so it's a thin line
[05:17:18] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:17:53] <uGoMobi> anyway... really happy with your help here :)
[05:18:03] <arschmitz> i guess a big deciding factor is how popular the plugin is if there is going to be demand for a fix or if its just 2 or 3 people
[05:18:19] <uGoMobi> yeah that's true
[05:18:27] <arschmitz> absolutly trying to do what i can
[05:24:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Whats your oppinion on 2561 im not sure id call that a bug?
[05:49:55] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... looking at 5051 ... it seems that we do indeed document that data-overlay-theme will set the border of the popup, as well as the background of the dialog, should the select menu be displayed as a dialog.
[05:51:01] <_|Nix|_> So, I think maybe 5200 is right - at least as far as our documentation is concerned ...
[05:53:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ yeah i agree once i realized what he was talking about (as he said he wasent very clear) i agree according to the docs his change looks correct
[05:54:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I'm'na accept that PR.
[05:55:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ : Cool it looked correct to me and i dont see where it could cause any problems.
[05:55:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/inYNkQ

[05:55:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #5200 from lobbin/themefix - Gabriel "_|Nix|_" Schulhof
[05:56:04] <arschmitz> i figured for popup related stuff you would be the guy to try and flag down to look at it if it looks like a real problem.
[05:59:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, there's a bit of a nomenclature issue: For popup, data-theme refers to the theme of the border, whereas data-overlay-theme refers to the screen behind the popup.
[06:00:06] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, for the select menu, data-theme refers to the button, whereas data-overlay-theme refers to the border of the popup (as well as the background of the dialog).
[06:00:26] <_|Nix|_> So, there's currently no way to set the theme for the screen behind the popup, when it's the popup of a select menu.
[06:00:41] <_|Nix|_> Now, that's fine by me, until someone wants that badly enough.
[06:01:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah the docs i think are clear though (execpt for the overlay not working on selects which is now fixed)
[06:01:23] <_|Nix|_> Then, we'll most likely have to come up with another option name.
[06:01:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, the docs are indeed as the PR implements.

[06:53:19] <bot-t1> (4 hours 33 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell scott_gonzalez I have found what might be a bug with the extension mechanism: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8724
[06:53:49] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: We're switching to {widgetName}:{callbackName} soon.
[06:54:47] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[06:59:08] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and I've applied the workaround for our slider. If we end up grabbing a version of the factory that has the fix, I'll change the slider to the way it should be, otherwise we might end up going directly for he new nomenclature.
[06:59:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: What about arbitrary items in the proto? Will those be lost?
[07:01:10] <scott_gonzalez> no
[07:01:17] <scott_gonzalez> It's only widgetEventPrefix because it's a dynamic default.
[07:01:38] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK, great!
[07:13:10] <uGoMobi> ?tell johnbender - John, can you give this a look when you have time https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5204#issuecomment-9740501 ? Thanks!

[07:17:19] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Awesome!
[07:18:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It may call refresh(), but does it call it with params set up such that most of refresh() is short-circuited?

[08:27:33] <scottjehl__> nice
[08:27:47] <scottjehl__> I'm also working on a variation like this, fyi: http://dabblet.com/gist/2842888
[08:29:40] <Wilto> oh damn, scottjehl__ in irc
[08:29:50] <johnbender> Wilto: right!??!
[08:29:50] <bot-t1> (1 hour 16 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell johnbender - John, can you give this a look when you have time https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5204#issuecomment-9740501 ? Thanks!
[08:30:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I commented on that issue
[08:30:04] <johnbender> we need to just do a pass on it
[08:30:14] <johnbender> I was delaying doing any serious work until we have perf regression tests
[08:30:20] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah I just saw your comment, thank you
[08:30:24] <johnbender> uGoMobi: BUT!
[08:30:39] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: i really like that second one it will be great for phones
[08:30:40] <johnbender> we can still do the work as long as we create jsperf setups to make sure we're not lying to ourselves
[08:31:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I just did a test of repeatedly calling refresh since I believe that's where it spends most of it's time
[08:31:09] <johnbender> still need to do some more profiling
[08:31:53] <uGoMobi> johnbender: you are right, I am not even sure if the poor performance on some browsers is caused by this
[08:32:01] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm certain it is
[08:32:04] <johnbender> I was able to make a dent
[08:32:09] <johnbender> but I didn't spend much time
[08:32:17] <johnbender> I don't think it's a bunch of low hanging fruit at this point
[08:32:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Re:  It may call refresh(), but does it call it with params set up such that most of refresh() is short-circuited? ... actually that was where I got lost a bit
[09:18:27] <johnbender> toddmparker: alright, I'm on the road down to Tucson for the rest of the day
[09:18:35] <johnbender> I'll be online tonight though in case anything insane happens
[09:20:48] <scottjehl__> johnbender thanks for setting up the preview
[09:32:05] <mspisars> johnbender, scottjehl__: when is tables scheduled to be merged into jQm (approximately)?
[09:32:16] <scottjehl__> next release I guess?
[09:32:24] <mspisars> 2.1? or 3?
[09:32:27] <scottjehl__> it'll depend how it goes in testing
[09:32:44] <scottjehl__> hmm. toddmparker_ ?
[09:33:08] <mspisars> sorry 1.2.1 or 1.3?
[09:33:31] <toddmparker__> Down to 335 issues - nice work all!
[09:33:42] <toddmparker__> catching up
[09:34:25] <arschmitz> morning toddparker__:
[09:35:22] <arschmitz> toddmparker__: last night i started going through the ones that have been the longest with out an update found a lot the uGoMobi: has been running behind me an closing!
[09:35:50] <toddmparker__> that is perfect - you set it up and we spike it
[09:36:16] <toddmparker__> that is a good approach - sort by oldest created/updated
[09:36:31] <toddmparker__> lot of pre-1.0 issues that are wack
[09:36:58] <arschmitz> yeah i found 3 or 4 related to the old fixed toolbars
[09:37:01] <agcolom> good morning/afternnon/evening all!
[09:42:01] <toddmparker__> arschmitz: where are we at with https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/commit/3f5a5bba55584634d4224a62a33a1f9d4aba8ebb#commitcomment-2046348
[09:42:16] <toddmparker__> were you waiting on us to weigh in on that?
[09:43:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker__: pretty much just waiting to see what direction everyone thinks i should go with it
[09:43:49] <arschmitz> toddmparker__: i had already updated with johnbenders: original comments but then all the other discussion came up with no conclusion so i was kinda in a holding pattern on it
[09:44:13] <toddmparker__> ok, I'll try to get some eyes on it for you
[09:44:25] <arschmitz> cool
[09:45:10] <arschmitz> im thinking that dropping the _fixPosition function would be smart either way though untill someone starts complaining about ios6 then it could be revisited
[09:45:57] <arschmitz> maybe ill do another commit removing that and refrence it so people can see that?
[09:47:36] <Wilto> Hi, eyes here.
[09:47:37] <arschmitz> though in all the testing iv been able to do _fixPosition does only work as intended with no crazyness (so far would like to see on a range of real androids and other devices if it ever gets called)
[09:48:52] <Wilto> I’m okay with pulling in those fixes and limiting them to Android 2.x/iOS5.
[09:49:43] <Wilto> I mean, the fixed plugin is already lousy with browser sniffing anyway, because there is no other way.
[09:52:55] <Wilto> johnbender, scottjehl__, what say you?
[09:53:29] <scottjehl__> https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/commit/3f5a5bba55584634d4224a62a33a1f9d4aba8ebb#commitcomment-2046419
[09:53:33] <scottjehl__> my thoughts
[09:53:43] <scottjehl__> I'd like to minimize workarounds for old platforms
[09:54:42] <Wilto> I think we originally kicked out, 2.x but had to back it out when scores of people griped.
[09:54:59] <Wilto> I can’t put a comma in the right place to save my, life today.
[09:55:20] <arschmitz> its that whole 80% of android users on 2.x still that hurts
[09:56:19] <scottjehl__> sure, but this is a feature that can safely drop back to the iOS4 behavior (it used to work in 2.x that way), and the native fixed behavior is really janky anyway
[09:56:23] <toddmparker__> 2.x is close to 90% of android so even though it's "older", it's still being sold and is so popular...
[09:56:46] <scottjehl__> letting it degrade to static isn't a bad idea in 2.x, imo
[09:56:58] <toddmparker__> people will freak
[09:57:17] <toddmparker__> they freaked out when we kicked out BB5/6 because their fixed positioning was so janky
[09:57:21] <scottjehl__> depends if you feel fixed is an enhancement or a breaker
[09:57:31] <Wilto> I don’t disagree with Scott. I mean, for another thing, fixed breaks a friggin’ LOT of stuff on 2.x.
[09:57:37] <scottjehl__> I think it's better static on 2.x
[09:57:41] <scottjehl__> for users
[09:57:56] <Wilto> Agreed there.
[09:58:01] <scottjehl__> also simplifies our code to enhance environments that behave
[09:58:15] <Wilto> Am I misremembering, though? I thought we started without 2.x, and had to add it back in?
[09:58:33] <toddmparker__> so what are we talking about? fixed only works on what?
[09:59:02] <toddmparker__> if you say iOS6 and BB4.x, that's going to be a tough sell
[09:59:09] <toddmparker__> sorry android 4.x
[09:59:50] <scottjehl__> not sure. I just think our support strategy should be to make things slick where it's straight-forward, and make things usable/acceptable in older places. Every time we add a feature that uses new CSS functionality, we'll have to face this decision of whether to add overhead for older places or just let it be
[09:59:56] <toddmparker__> but I do agree that android 2.x has a boatload of issues with fixed
[10:00:26] <toddmparker__> I agree with that
[10:00:28] <scottjehl__> 2.x users would likely appreciate a more typical experience of that platform
[10:01:08] <toddmparker__> first Q: what browsers would get fixed then?
[10:01:31] <scottjehl__> to be clear, we never build in a way that is breaks usability anywhere, but for devs who can't live without faux-fixed behavior in 2.x, we can offer the polyfill
[10:01:36] <arschmitz> maybe seperate it into a different file and make it an option?? that way they can take their chances and optin to true fixed but by default they are opted out?
[10:01:46] <scottjehl__> whoa sorry about the ??
[10:01:53] <scottjehl__> not sure what that was :)
[10:01:59] <toddmparker__> that's where I'm leaning. Build these hacks as an extension to fixed
[10:02:19] <scottjehl__> yeah so then it comes to whether we maintain the option or not
[10:02:20] <toddmparker__> scottjehl__: the ??
[10:02:22] <Wilto> How did Android 2.x do with the old `position: fauxed` approach?
[10:02:35] <scottjehl__> I vote to make it 3rd party (nevermind the ?? comment my irc freaked)
[10:02:46] <toddmparker__> I don't think we saw the ??
[10:02:47] <scottjehl__> wilto it did as well as 2.x does with anything
[10:03:04] <Wilto> Which is to say “oh god there’s fire everywhere.”
[10:03:17] <toddmparker__> the old approach was janky IMHO
[10:03:23] <scottjehl__> less fire than fixed brings, I'd say
[10:03:27] <toddmparker__> I'd rather have static for sure
[10:03:43] <scottjehl__> I prefer static to the absolute behavior, just because it's hard to hide the bars before a scroll 100% of the time
[10:04:07] <toddmparker__> so why don't we build this as an extension and decide once it's done what our support strategy is
[10:04:11] <scottjehl__> but the polyfill could add the padding workaround above for 2.x
[10:04:21] <scottjehl__> well, once it's ours we own it
[10:04:31] <toddmparker__> If we can just have this work so if the extension is included, it works in more places, no need for an option
[10:04:34] <scottjehl__> we're left supporting 2.x with future feature workarounds
[10:04:40] <Wilto> My official vote is that we demote 2.x, and when/if people gripe we either a) point them to the old `fauxed` shim, or b) instruct them to just use `position: fixed` independent of jQM, but know that it may or may not be their own funeral.
[10:05:12] <toddmparker__> But neig=ther of those are good options
[10:05:17] <toddmparker__> neither
[10:05:27] <scottjehl__> 2.x is not a showcase jqm platform as it is. Static is probably better for users
[10:05:30] <Wilto> I think that’s the thing. What we have now isn’t food in 2.x, either.
[10:05:40] <Wilto> …good isn’t good what is with me today
[10:05:48] <toddmparker__> 2.x seems to work fairly well and with these tweaks, it's improved, right?
[10:06:05] <scottjehl__> This padding thing is one more step of jank. We've got a ton of these in jQM
[10:06:15] <scottjehl__> it's a great trick, but they're all costly
[10:06:27] <Wilto> Yeah. This is a clever fix for sure, but… it’s adding weird stuff for old Android.
[10:06:50] <toddmparker__> sure, that's why moving this out makes a lot of sense
[10:06:51] <arschmitz> just to throw in my 2 cents i think people are going to freak out if true fixed is basicly io6 and android3 and 4 that basicly means only ios 6 considdering 3 and 4 adoption rates for android
[10:07:24] <toddmparker__> that's my concern
[10:07:44] <scottjehl__> supporting fixed in 2.x means other compromises
[10:07:49] <scottjehl__> it's not a good platform for that feature
[10:07:52] <toddmparker__> we added this as a big feature for 1.1 and are taking it away again for most people
[10:07:58] <scottjehl__> for example, disabling user zoom
[10:08:05] <scottjehl__> is that a tradeoff in the users interest?
[10:08:19] <Wilto> aw hell naw
[10:08:21] <arschmitz> ios fixed is totally messed up if you zoom too though
[10:08:27] <toddmparker__> depends on the person
[10:08:46] <arschmitz> it does the crazy dual rate fixed scrolling its nutty!
[10:09:23] <scottjehl__> at most, I say we offer an extension for this
[10:09:46] <toddmparker__> I'd be in favor of pulling all the 2.x garbage (like disabling zoom) out of the core plugin and into an extension so people can easily uncheck that
[10:09:53] <scottjehl__> as a user of 2.x for a few months this year, I never appreciated the fixed behavior on sites like twitter
[10:09:55] <scottjehl__> super jank
[10:10:31] <Wilto> I think what it comes down to for me is that it’s hard to make a case for fixed positioning being better than static for a user on Android 2.x—in terms of both fixed itself, and the weird-ass bugs that spring up in its wake. Many of which I’m guessing devs will miss.
[10:10:37] <toddmparker__> The support question is a bit harder to quantify. if we move this totally out, we cna wash our hands but it will be a very unpopular decision
[10:11:01] <toddmparker__> we can leave this as an extension with a lot fo caveats and decide how much to iterate on the code
[10:11:19] <arschmitz> i think as an enduser you may be right but as a designer developer they are going to want this
[10:11:43] <Wilto> I’d rather fend off ten pissed-off developers than screw up a site for one user.
[10:11:45] <scottjehl__> I think we'll be making many of those soon (media queries, etc) it'll be about advocacy
[10:12:13] <scottjehl__> let's try the extension approach, then decide if we host it or paste it into the docs
[10:12:37] <toddmparker__> OUr job is to make this hard, messy stuff easy
[10:12:44] <scottjehl__> absolutely.
[10:12:53] <toddmparker__> I think we just need to approach this in steps or it will look bad
[10:13:26] <scottjehl__> I am unsure our job is to make 2.x look better than it really is, rather than embracing its capabilities
[10:13:30] <toddmparker__> if we move this out into an extension, it makes it easy for folks to not add all this hackery if they don't want it
[10:13:41] <scottjehl__> sure.
[10:13:47] <scottjehl__> then it comes down to support
[10:13:56] <toddmparker__> that sets the stage for us to deprecate this extension in the future
[10:13:58] <scottjehl__> we have to maintain this workaround
[10:14:04] <Wilto> NOT IT
[10:14:15] <toddmparker__> right, well that's true
[10:14:22] <scottjehl__> well, not having it at all is where we are now
[10:14:27] <scottjehl__> we can offer a workaround in the docs
[10:14:50] <scottjehl__> it's not much more than binding to fixedtoolbarcreate and adding some even bindings, right?
[10:15:27] <arschmitz> pretty much
[10:16:01] <toddmparker__> I just don't think the out of the box experience should degrade with this change for 1.3
[10:16:01] <scottjehl__> if( android2x ) { $.mobile.fixedtoolbar.prototype.options.supportBlacklist = function(){ return false; }   ...add polyfill here
[10:17:07] <arschmitz> that still degrades the default experience though which is what toddmparker seems unwilling to do right?
[10:17:42] <toddmparker__> I guess I see the next step as the same: let's make the extension
[10:17:43] <scottjehl__> without the extension, it should be degraded, ya. At least that was what I was thinking
[10:17:49] <Wilto> The guy downstairs blasting Adele while discussing fixed positioning on Android 2.x.
[10:18:17] <toddmparker__> whether it lives in our repo and is on be default, lives in a 3rd party repo, or is just code sample code pated into a demo, it's still the same code
[10:18:24] <Wilto> I either pissed off a curse-weaving gypsy during my commute, or I got hit by a silver line bus and this is actual hell.
[10:18:39] <scottjehl__> toddmparker__ agreed. I think that decision comes after
[10:18:47] <Wilto> arschmitz: Unless you wanna keep your name on this sucker.
[10:18:55] <Wilto> Chuck it up in a repo and we could link to it.
[10:19:02] <scottjehl__> maybe we write it in a branch as if it's a third-party extension
[10:19:06] <toddmparker__> I sort fo want to see how this all shakes out, code-wise
[10:19:08] <scottjehl__> decide after
[10:19:09] <scottjehl__> ya
[10:19:19] <Wilto> I can’t imagine there’d be much maintenance involved, but it’s tough to chuck it in with all our other ongoing maintenance, y’know?
[10:19:25] <toddmparker__> I think we can all agree that the core fixed toolbars should be cleaner and we should move this stuff out
[10:19:37] <arschmitz> ill maintain it i have no problems there.
[10:19:44] <toddmparker__> SOLD
[10:19:54] <scottjehl__> adding code, however small, to make old browsers work better should always be questioned, is all
[10:20:19] <Wilto> Awesome. Like I said, I can’t imagine people asking for many changes over time. Just easier not to have it lumped in with all our other buckwild hackishness.
[10:20:30] <Wilto> scottjehl__: Plus one million.
[10:20:31] <toddmparker__> completely agree
[10:20:39] <toddmparker__> this is just a sensitive subject
[10:20:43] <arschmitz> scottjehl: i agree hard to call something with 90% adoption old though even if it is
[10:20:48] <scottjehl__> cool - great work arschmitz
[10:20:58] <scottjehl__> glad to have your help
[10:21:02] <toddmparker__> if you go to best buy, most android devices sold right now are 2.x
[10:21:25] <toddmparker__> so does any of this effect iOS 5?
[10:21:29] <arschmitz> yes
[10:21:33] <arschmitz> BIG TIME
[10:21:46] <arschmitz> thats what i wrote it for was ios5 android i found after
[10:21:49] <Wilto> DUN DUN DUNNN
[10:21:52] <scottjehl__> my 2.3 Galaxy has user zoom disabling removed by the carrier - which means there's no fixed support at all
[10:22:03] <toddmparker__> ha, interesting.
[10:22:12] <Wilto> friggin’ android
[10:22:14] <toddmparker__> so what's the story with iOS5?
[10:22:18] <Wilto> …Though I like that idea.
[10:22:30] <scottjehl__> bought it in Cambodia so I'm not sure how common that is. Maybe common
[10:22:42] <arschmitz> in ios5 if you scroll the page programaticly toolbars are 100% unresponsive
[10:22:55] <scottjehl__> probably a particular version of Samsungs rather than the carrier actually
[10:23:08] <arschmitz> or if you follow a link that scrolls to an id (coming in johnbenders new nav)
[10:23:10] <scottjehl__> arschmitz true. documented in devicebugs
[10:23:25] <scottjehl__> our job to fix, or just explain?
[10:23:38] <arschmitz> also on keyboard pop the bars move to middle of screen
[10:24:10] <scottjehl__> yeah. fixed footers are a good idea in zero web apps
[10:24:20] <scottjehl__> headers are often fine
[10:24:23] <scottjehl__> unqualified even
[10:24:25] <toddmparker__> huh. not good. funny I didn't see that too often when I was on iOS5
[10:24:25] <arschmitz> header does the same if the input is near it
[10:24:34] <scottjehl__> ah, nevermind then
[10:24:43] <toddmparker__> so this workaround improves things for iOS5, but with some...overhead
[10:24:46] <arschmitz> ios6 has the same keyboard pop issue
[10:24:59] <toddmparker__> but the other issues are gone?
[10:25:11] <arschmitz> programatic scrolling is fine in ios6
[10:25:14] <toddmparker__> BTW - http://www.cultofmac.com/197280/one-month-later-ios-6-market-share-climbs-beyond-60-report/
[10:25:33] <toddmparker__> I think iOS5 will soon be mostly gone, thankfully
[10:25:40] <arschmitz> i agree
[10:25:57] <arschmitz> and just to be clear on one thing here
[10:26:33] <arschmitz> to fix for android and ios5 the only part of that commit that is "needed" is to add one pixel to bottom padding then remove it on scroll stop
[10:26:44] <scottjehl__> right on.
[10:26:57] <arschmitz> all the repositioning stuff is ONLY for fixing the keyboard pop on ios6
[10:27:08] <scottjehl__> k.
[10:27:10] <scottjehl__> ugh
[10:27:31] <arschmitz> im not sure if iv been clear about that
[10:28:08] <arschmitz> oh and the keyboard pop is only an issue on ipad not iphone
[10:28:14] <scottjehl__> we have so much stuff in this framework, particularly in transitions JS, to try and combat issues like this. The problem is they often need to happen synchronously and they become noticeable. That's why I'm touchy on these workarounds is all
[10:28:18] <arschmitz> iphone toolbars are hidden on keyboard pop
[10:28:42] <scottjehl__> so it's more complicated than 2.x basically
[10:28:47] <arschmitz> for sure
[10:28:48] <toddmparker__> Right, remember that
[10:28:57] <toddmparker__> Space was too tight with iPhone
[10:29:14] <toddmparker__> How much overlap is there is this code?
[10:29:23] <toddmparker__> between iOS5 and Android
[10:29:33] <arschmitz> ios5 and android are identical for this
[10:29:41] <arschmitz> ios6 gets all the janky extra stuff
[10:30:25] <toddmparker__> so if iOS6 still needs janky stuff, this isn't even for older versions
[10:30:41] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/grumble.jpg
[10:31:19] <arschmitz> yea they made the keyboard problem MUCH harder to adress in ios6 ! thats the wrong way to take things!!!
[10:31:37] <toddmparker__> hrm
[10:31:59] <toddmparker__> hadn't fully grasped that this was also needed for iOS6
[10:32:37] <toddmparker__> This is how we ended up with the hackery for 2.x in the code - they were "the latest" so we made it work
[10:33:08] <arschmitz> yeah and the worst part is the uglyest part of the code is only there for ios6
[10:33:26] <toddmparker__> ugh
[10:33:42] <arschmitz> what i do is attempt the ios5 android fix first because its much less janky
[10:33:53] <toddmparker__> Q: what if toolbars hid when the keyboard was up across the board?
[10:33:54] <arschmitz> and if that fails i manually reposition (ios6)
[10:34:07] <arschmitz> that removes issues for ios6
[10:34:17] <arschmitz> and gets us back to ios5 and android 2.x
[10:34:28] <toddmparker__> that would make me feel better
[10:34:36] <scottjehl__> hiding them while keyboard is up is a good move overall, i think
[10:34:45] <arschmitz> im down with that
[10:34:47] <toddmparker__> more space for stuff you care about
[10:34:58] <scottjehl__> well, hiding with our supported toggle
[10:35:03] <toddmparker__> unless the input you're typing in is in a fixed toolbar
[10:35:07] <scottjehl__> the one that bumps them into abs positioning
[10:35:18] <scottjehl__> true
[10:35:58] <toddmparker__> because if we can't find a mix of features to make the toolbars work cleanly in at least the latest versions, it's hard to sell this extension
[10:36:02] <arschmitz> yeah text in position fixed is a bad combo with on screen keyboard!
[10:36:23] <toddmparker__> which is a pretty common scenario I'd imagine
[10:36:47] <toddmparker__> ex: list of contacts with search toolbar on top in a fixed position
[10:37:00] <scottjehl__> maybe we should just add a _workarounds private method and kick it off from create
[10:37:13] <toddmparker__> so we need to look at that anyway, maybe arschmitz can build some demo pages as we work through this extension
[10:37:28] <scottjehl__> add our stuff in there to make platforms that we do want to support, work
[10:37:40] <Wilto> Iiiinteresting.
[10:38:22] <arschmitz> so basicly keep true fixed but relagate all the support crap into workarounds so one day hopefully it can be removed?
[10:38:42] <arschmitz> and keep the core widget clean?
[10:40:07] <toddmparker__> Yes, that would be ideal
[10:40:24] <arschmitz> if im understnading your idea right scottjehl: in workarounds logic could also be added for browser detection to only use the needed workaround
[10:40:32] <arschmitz> s
[10:40:53] <toddmparker__> We should comment the hell out these workarounds so we can know when to drop them
[10:41:25] <arschmitz> ^^agreed know exactly what and why with each one
[10:42:05] <arschmitz> like mandatory platforms affected: problem fixed: how it works: etc
[10:42:56] <scottjehl__> yeah, ideally still in an extension file
[10:44:05] <arschmitz> yeah workarounds would call the approriate extension  for each "workaround" right?
[10:44:06] <scottjehl__> looking forward to seeing what you come up with
[10:44:11] <scottjehl__> i'm going to drop off and build things
[10:44:14] <scottjehl__> talk in a bit!
[10:44:33] <Wilto> also going into seclusion to build things
[10:44:51] <Wilto> You Chatty Cathies are burnin’ through my workday.
[10:44:58] <Wilto> Cathys. Cathii.
[10:45:11] <Wilto> Cathices anyway later on guys.
[10:47:07] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ok so next step on this add a workarounds method that will call extensions for platform specific workarounds. move current commit into such an extension?
[10:48:03] <toddmparker__> Yep
[10:48:28] <toddmparker__> and I guess change the default toolbar behavior to hide with the keyboard open
[10:48:37] <arschmitz> sounds good.
[10:48:43] <arschmitz> ill get started on it
[10:48:54] <arschmitz> oh one question about the demos we discussed last night
[10:49:01] <toddmparker__> sure
[10:49:26] <arschmitz> for the sortable one. iv been trying to think of a more real life use case rather then just some generic sortable list
[10:49:32] <arschmitz> any thoughts?
[10:50:06] <arschmitz> seems like our trend is towards real life examples for the demos so i wanted to continue that
[10:52:57] <toddmparker__> sure
[10:53:15] <toddmparker__> on iOS, you can create a list of cities for your weather and sort them
[10:53:18] <toddmparker__> same for alarms
[10:53:24] <toddmparker__> something like that maybe?
[10:53:40] <toddmparker__> maybe a simple todo list?
[10:53:47] <arschmitz> cool yeah good ideas
[10:53:55] <arschmitz> oh i got a good one
[10:53:58] <toddmparker__> click + and open a popup with an input to add
[10:54:07] <toddmparker__> then allow the list to be sorted
[10:54:09] <arschmitz> shift assignments
[10:54:43] <toddmparker__> example?
[10:54:47] <arschmitz> do linked lists one with team members and one with duties and drag them to the approriate place in a list with dividers
[10:54:49] <toddmparker__> bot familiar
[10:54:58] <toddmparker__> gotcha
[10:55:14] <toddmparker__> the one thing we should avoid is needing to scroll much
[10:55:28] <arschmitz> yeah iv been brainstorming on layouts to avoid that
[10:55:29] <toddmparker__> so try to think of short examples :)
[10:56:19] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[10:56:25] <toddmparker__> that's why anything that is just a simple ranked/ordered list might be a good idea
[10:56:32] <arschmitz> yeah
[10:56:57] <toddmparker__> rank the attributes you think are important for ________
[10:57:06] <arschmitz> yup
[10:57:10] <arschmitz> or like a leaderboard
[10:57:16] <toddmparker__> yeah, that too
[10:57:55] <toddmparker__> be cool if it was a mode - hit an edit button and they get grippers and the edit switches to "save"
[10:58:25] <arschmitz> yeah that shouldnt be hard
[10:59:00] <toddmparker__> nice
[10:59:10] <toddmparker__> think we've loaded you up with stuff to do :)
[10:59:17] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah
[10:59:29] <arschmitz> espically with the conf in 2 weeks
[10:59:43] <arschmitz> they want a 40 minute talk thats long lol
[11:00:24] <arschmitz> but i think i came up with something that will be easy to talk for a long time about lol
[11:01:14] <arschmitz> the most common problems people run into developing with jqm.
[11:02:03] <arschmitz> just wade through the forums and see what people are having problems with the most (i spent a lot of time in there so i already know a bunch) not to mention any problems i ran into using it
[11:02:23] <arschmitz> and i figgured you and johnbender would know some good ones too
[11:02:55] <arschmitz> a lot to do with dynamic content
[11:03:08] <arschmitz> and just a lot of the potential pitfalls people face
[11:08:58] <toddmparker__> that's a great idea
[11:09:20] <toddmparker__> whatever you find, we should feed back into the docs and demos
[11:09:20] <arschmitz> cool
[11:09:40] <arschmitz> yeah sadly MOST of them are already there people just dont read!
[11:10:17] <arschmitz> i spent like 2 months every day in the forums helping people but started to get jaded at it always being the same questions that are very clear in the docs
[11:10:43] <arschmitz> but thats also why i think it would be a good talk
[11:10:57] <arschmitz> because it is the same things over and over and over again
[11:13:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker__: well im off to a late lunch ill be back later if your around i need to write up abstract to send to ajpiano and would like you to read it over when im done see if it sounds like a good talk ha ha.
[11:47:02] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #122: STILL FAILING in 18 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/122/
[12:10:27] <toddmparker__> sounds good arschmitz
[12:35:18] <arschmitz> 46 closed tickets so far this week!
[12:39:07] <toddmparker__> BOOM
[12:39:10] <toddmparker__> that is awesome
[12:39:40] <toddmparker__> this is what happens: we feed you all kinds of projects and triage goes by the wayside
[12:39:55] <toddmparker__> so tell me "no" if that happens
[12:40:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and i were talking this morning we want it under 300
[12:40:03] <toddmparker__> :)
[12:40:16] <toddmparker__> yes we do
[12:40:49] <arschmitz> iv just been going through them on the laptop while i watch tv at night.
[12:41:26] <arschmitz> for just triage its really easy if it looks like it might be a quick fix ill write it down to check it the next day
[12:42:31] <arschmitz> other wise move on or comment that i think it should be closed
[12:45:24] <agcolom> toddmparker__: Hi! My partner was given a Nexus 7 at work today! So if there's anything you'd like me to test on it, just let me know.... (unless you already have one in the office)
[12:45:35] <toddmparker__> hey agcolom
[12:45:46] <toddmparker__> good to know. nice little device
[12:46:03] <toddmparker__> arschmitz: that's what I do too - TV + jQM
[12:46:06] <agcolom> yes, I just played with it for a little bit...
[12:47:10] <agcolom> quite nice, but I keep on wanting to press the buttom button (that does not exist!) like I do on the iPAd!
[12:47:16] <toddmparker__> browser is good (Chrome)
[12:47:25] <agcolom> bottom^
[12:47:33] <agcolom> yes.
[12:47:38] <toddmparker__> yeah, you end up missing the home button on every other device.
[12:47:53] <toddmparker__> hunting on all edges (or the back) for a power button is terrible
[12:48:02] <toddmparker__> not sure why nobody has one. Patents?
[12:48:20] <agcolom> possibly! that wouldn't surprise me
[12:48:29] <arschmitz> samsung had some with one and yeah apple sued them
[12:49:35] <toddmparker__> heh. patent the obvious
[12:50:59] <arschmitz> im getting an old samsung galaxy s II with 2.3.7 tomorrow for testing also i dont think you have an s II
[12:52:03] <toddmparker__> nice. didn't know we were up to .7
[12:52:33] <toddmparker__> 2.3 will never die. It's the Windows 95/BB5 of Android...golden times
[12:52:38] <arschmitz> neither did i ! its my little brothers old phone
[12:53:03] <toddmparker__> think they will support 2.3 for a long while
[12:53:30] <arschmitz> they almost have to at this point
[12:54:22] <arschmitz> the only thing that will save us is people generally get a new phone every 2 years or so
[12:54:30] <arschmitz> much quicker then laptops or desktops
[13:01:49] <gseguin> oh wow! there are 3 toddmparker__ today
[13:01:59] <gseguin> having trouble with ZNC ?
[13:03:02] <gseguin> and arschmitz is rocking the triage, thank you sir!
[13:03:08] <agcolom> hey gseguin! did you get back ok?
[13:03:57] <gseguin> yeah, plane was early!
[13:05:06] <agcolom> good! jet lag disappeared after sunday...
[13:05:25] <agcolom> (except for food!)
[13:05:29] <gseguin> was sick until Monday though
[13:05:37] <agcolom> oh no!
[13:05:50] <agcolom> must have been the food, because I've not had that at all...
[13:05:58] <gseguin> neh just a cold
[13:06:12] <gseguin> toddmparker__ got the same I think
[13:06:12] <agcolom> oh I get it....
[13:06:41] <agcolom> I've been fine for that too.... must be all these vitamins ;)
[13:06:57] <gseguin> heh, it's all about taking them early
[13:06:58] <agcolom> (or being used to London weather and bugs!)
[13:07:10] <gseguin> or that ;)
