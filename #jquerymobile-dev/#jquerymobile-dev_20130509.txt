[06:25:42] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: Here is an example (I think) of the mouse/ touch event delegation target mismatch issue you were discussing yesterday
[06:25:51] <toddmparker> http://terebentina.github.io/sco.js/
[06:26:06] <toddmparker> Go to collapsibles in an iPhone 
[06:26:55] <toddmparker> Tap the collapsible link and it with open then shut. Think that's the issue. When stuff moves when tapped, it looks like a double click happened
[06:27:29] <toddmparker> Crazy they didn't test these on touch

[08:00:26] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06next 14b131bfd 15Jasper de Groot: Button: Simplified the selector for native input style.
[08:00:26] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06next 141229c97 15Jasper de Groot: Fieldcontain: Label margin bottom inside popups should match the default we set in core.css.
[08:00:26] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06next 14eb5ca31 15Jasper de Groot: Textarea: Make mini size work when class ui-mini is on the container. Adjusted margin for mini textarea.
[08:09:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: In branch "next" I made the CSS buttons in toolbars default to mini and inline. So all what's needed for 1.4 is auto-enhance links as buttons and add the ui-btn-left/right classes.
[08:10:10] <arschmitz> ok
[08:10:43] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: once you merge ill update toolbar and merge it 
[08:10:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great, thanks!
[08:11:49] <arschmitz> not sure which merge will be easier the toolbar one after next or next after toolbar lol
[08:12:26] <gseguin> good morning
[08:12:32] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[08:13:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure either
[08:15:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: getting ready to merge removing nested listviews
[08:15:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok nice
[08:15:43] <uGoMobi> I made changes to listview.js
[08:15:46] <arschmitz> sadly cant get rid of the dependants functions in core though because custom select uses them for dialogs
[08:15:47] <uGoMobi> in next I mean
[08:16:13] <uGoMobi> but I will merge master in next after you merged that
[08:16:14] <arschmitz> thats going to be a pain to merge then
[08:16:19] <uGoMobi> :)
[08:16:35] <arschmitz> problem with next is it touches too many things
[08:16:46] <arschmitz> so no matter what the merge is always going to be ugly
[08:17:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that remove with dependants function doesn't work well with selects though
[08:17:31] <arschmitz> yeah but it completely breaks them without
[08:17:35] <uGoMobi> but that's another thing
[08:17:37] <uGoMobi> yeah
[08:17:45] <uGoMobi> so we look into that later
[08:18:02] <arschmitz> yeah the future of custom select is up in the air right now anyway
[08:18:15] <arschmitz> so im just going to leave it alone until we decide there
[08:18:28] <uGoMobi> yeah sounds good
[08:24:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: gseguin : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5984 do I understand this right... he uses jQuery Migrate which makes $.attrFn work in jQuery 1.8+ but wants us to prevent this because otherwise Migrate puts a warning in the console log
[08:25:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup i read that too
[08:25:38] <arschmitz> but migrate is only for dev not production anyway so.....
[08:25:52] <uGoMobi> won't fix
[08:26:18] <arschmitz> yeah its just used a feature test on our part to check the jquery version
[08:28:12] <arschmitz> and +1 to wont fix
[08:29:05] <uGoMobi> well we could actually check the jQuery version but it's simpler to just check if $.attrFn exists because if so that's what we use

[08:30:15] <uGoMobi> BYE BYE nested listviews :)
[08:30:21] <arschmitz> yeah yup
[08:30:29] <arschmitz> also a bunch of updates to core
[08:31:07] <arschmitz> nothing major though just little things we were doing wrong
[08:31:40] <gseguin> uGoMobi: Yay! to that!

[08:54:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not a single merge conflict ^^^
[08:54:54] <uGoMobi> not sure if that's a good thing ;)
[08:55:03] <arschmitz> nice
[08:55:22] <arschmitz> just means you have been mergeing regularly enough that its staying up to date
[08:55:25] <arschmitz> that awesome
[08:56:29] <uGoMobi> yup
[09:45:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4826 the issue is that we use "tap" to add active button class to the collapsible and "click" to expand/collapse. Do you think your changes to events might have fixed this?
[09:46:36] <uGoMobi> problem is that I can't reproduce the issue on my Android devices when I test with 1.2.1
[09:58:58] <toddmparker> hi all
[10:19:55] <gseguin> hey Todd
[10:23:57] <toddmparker> hi gseguin 
[10:37:38] <toddmparker> created an agenda - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r7lQa0pnbbbOkwGMnrhN_kaeCM-jJ_GtNim72YFgXJg/edit#
[11:00:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe ill check it out
[11:01:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, the markup changes in "next" might help too
[11:01:50] <arschmitz> yeah your using all :active now instead of a class right?
[11:02:33] <toddmparker> ok, let's do this
[12:22:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: :active is for the down state, we still need to add the active button class for active state
[12:23:01] <arschmitz> ah ok
[12:25:12] <uGoMobi> ok I have to go... later all
[12:31:41] <arschmitz> johnbender: you still around?
[13:17:36] <johnbender> arschmitz: yes!
[13:17:39] <johnbender> just got back from lunch
[13:17:44] <johnbender> what can I do for you
[13:17:53] <arschmitz> having some trouble with tests
[13:18:15] <arschmitz> thought maybe you could point me in right direction
[13:18:26] <johnbender> sure what's up
[13:18:27] <johnbender> ?
[13:18:33] <arschmitz> johnbender: im trying to get all the tests updated on my branch for toolbar widget
[13:18:53] <johnbender> hmm I've never worked with the toolbar tests
[13:18:53] <arschmitz> but collapsible tests are driving me insane i cant see whats wrong with them
[13:19:03] <arschmitz> yeah its not the toolbar tests
[13:19:08] <johnbender> same situation for me though
[13:19:13] <johnbender> which one is failing
[13:19:17] <johnbender> or which one*s*
[13:19:24] <arschmitz> very first collapsible test
[13:19:43] <arschmitz> but when i check a real page everything is enhanced properly
[13:20:40] <arschmitz> and when i check in console on test page the classes are there
[13:22:13] <johnbender> arschmitz: so which of the ok method calls is failing
[13:22:16] <johnbender> all of them?
[13:22:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: I'm confused
[13:22:29] <johnbender> you're saying the classes are all there but the tests are failing
[13:22:41] <johnbender> one of those has to be untrue 
[13:22:47] <johnbender> unless I'm missing something
[13:23:04] <arschmitz> johnbender: me too.... 
[13:23:15] <arschmitz> and yes all of the first test is failing
[13:23:17] <johnbender> arschmitz: is this on master or another branch?
[13:23:35] <arschmitz> its on a branch 
[13:23:38] <johnbender> arschmitz: I have a meeting in 30 minutes but I can take a look afterward if it's somewhere I can look into
[13:23:45] <johnbender> arschmitz: don't mind
[13:23:51] <arschmitz> ok ill update the branch iv made some changes
[13:24:29] <arschmitz> its the branch is page-sections
[13:24:48] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool
[13:25:00] <johnbender> I'll take a look tonight after my meeting or tomorrow morning at the latest
[13:25:08] <arschmitz> no problem
[13:25:17] <johnbender> arschmitz: is it blocking you on anything?
[13:25:20] <arschmitz> with any luck ill figure it out first lol
[13:25:25] <johnbender> if it's a big blocker I can take a look tinight
[13:25:34] <arschmitz> not really trying to get the new widget merged but its not critical
[13:25:37] <johnbender> yes there's always that I guess :)
[13:26:07] <johnbender> I'm interested to see if were going to have a lot of bugs this release
[13:26:18] <johnbender> have you and _|Nix|_ been able to add some unit tests for you refactors?
[13:26:21] <johnbender> I've been meaning to ask
[13:26:44] <arschmitz> im going to for this trying to get current tests passing first though
[13:27:53] <arschmitz> johnbender: i see the problem actually
[13:27:57] <johnbender> arschmitz: yay!
[13:27:59] <johnbender> success
[13:28:04] <arschmitz> .ui-content is not being applied
[13:28:17] <arschmitz> and all the tests are scoped to that
[13:28:36] <arschmitz> so now i just need to figure out why its not applied lol
[13:29:23] <arschmitz> ahhhh..... ok bad merge is the issue i merged master and it wiped out a bunch of my changes :(
[13:29:54] <johnbender> bleh
[13:30:03] <arschmitz> johnbender: at least thats easy to fix
[13:30:20] <johnbender> I've been trying to merge once a week so I don't get too far behind
[13:30:37] <johnbender> dealing with one or two conflicts is easier than 10
[13:30:49] <arschmitz> yeah this one had been about 2 weeks weird thing is it had no conflicts when i merged
[13:31:05] <johnbender> o.o
[13:36:07] <arschmitz> ahhh all green :)
