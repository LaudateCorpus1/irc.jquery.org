[00:22:18] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: use existing elem instead of creating a new one.

[08:08:12] <Wilto> Uh oh.
[08:08:23] <gseguin> looking into it
[08:09:35] <gseguin> ok I think I got it
[08:09:40] <gseguin> testing
[08:13:38] <gseguin> yeah totally my bad... fixed now

[08:14:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #3429 - Ghislain Seguin
[08:15:21] <Wilto> Are the tests still on fire?
[08:15:25] <gseguin> yeah
[08:15:34] <gseguin> I fixed a bunch
[08:15:36] <Wilto> AMD-stuff, or should I dig in?
[08:15:57] <gseguin> yeah it would be great if one of you can look at it
[08:16:56] <gseguin> I'm supposed to work on Jive stuff today however if there is something urgent I need to look at let me know
[08:17:36] <gseguin> I'll be on IRC all day
[08:18:56] <gseguin> the originatelabs' hudson has gone crazy, it looks like

[08:22:26] <jqm-jenkins-bot> ghislain: Fixes #3429
[08:25:31] <Wilto> Alright. I’m mid-stream on fixing up a feature test thing, but then I’ll see what I can do.
[08:25:50] <Wilto> Any clues I should know about, going into it? Remember I’m not exactly the most test-savvy dude around.
[08:30:21] <gseguin> I usually put a breakpoint at the beginning of the test and trace from there
[08:31:03] <gseguin> if it's caused by AMD, there is most likely something undefined (as in we have a missing dependency)
[08:31:17] <gseguin> hopefully bender is on today
[09:06:24] <gseguin> Wilto: I don't get it
[09:06:46] <gseguin> listview tests are passing locally
[09:24:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/IHFMdw
[09:24:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Backed out AMD changes to support test suite until we figure out how to make it stable - Ghislain Seguin
[09:54:44] <gseguin> hey johnbender, the tests have gone haywire
[09:55:00] <johnbender> gseguin: depends on which you're talking about
[09:55:29] <gseguin> I think for the time being we should revert all tests using reloadLib (or reloadModule) to not use AMD
[09:55:32] <johnbender> gseguin: the ones coming from the adobe jenkins server are accurate
[09:55:55] <gseguin> until jrburke introduces a function in require JS to "unload" a module
[09:56:08] <gseguin> yeah yeah they're failing
[09:56:15] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm, the only problem I have with that is that they were working before the merge
[09:56:20] <gseguin> though some are passing locally
[09:56:29] <johnbender> which means we might be missing actual load order issues
[09:57:05] <gseguin> possible
[09:57:14] <gseguin> I'm sorry to have left such a mess
[09:57:20] <jrburke> gseguin: i added an "unload" function in my branch of the jquerymobile stuff, at least as part of the testHelper. would using that help?
[09:57:22] <johnbender> gseguin: thats what the ci is for
[09:57:38] <johnbender> and some of the failures are like "path.get"
[09:57:43] <johnbender> which is a function and not a method
[09:57:46] <johnbender> so that's a serious failure
[09:57:48] <gseguin> oh jrburke where is that? I missed it
[09:59:00] <jrburke> gseguin: https://github.com/jrburke/jquery-mobile/blob/issue_3386-2/tests/jquery.testHelper.js#L64 you probably want to pull it out as a function, but that is the set of instructions (that will become requires.undef in the next release for requirejs)
[09:59:11] <jrburke> *requirejs.undef
[09:59:20] <gseguin> awesome
[10:00:18] <gseguin> thanks
[10:00:28] <johnbender> gseguin: most of those commits came from Scott eh?
[10:00:41] <gseguin> johnbender: I'll check that in, I need to focus on Jive tasks today
[10:01:04] <johnbender> gseguin: alright
[10:01:18] <jrburke> gseguin: also if you think some of the errors are due to loading issues, please feel free to let me know about them, i'm happy to take a look. i have a couple of meetings today but will have space in between.
[10:02:38] <gseguin> johnbender: I'll let you sync up with jrburke if there are test failures that could be due to loading issues
[10:02:39] <johnbender> jrburke: I don't think they are
[10:03:11] <johnbender> and at least a few of them definitely aren't
[10:03:28] <johnbender> so until those get sorted I'd rather not have you burn cycles on it

[12:09:54] <Wilto> johnbender: Yeah—the page fades out, and the dialog itself pops in.

[12:31:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: whats the reasoning behind having the transition files, it looks like they just define a property eh?
[12:38:34] <Wilto> johnbender: The individual JS files for each, you mean?
[12:39:09] <Wilto> Just to keep things modular—no sense having that code in there the users don’t add the associated transitions via the builder.
[12:41:19] <johnbender> hmm
[12:41:23] <johnbender> it's one line though lol
[12:41:36] <Wilto> Yeah, no, I know.
[12:41:50] <Wilto> I dunno… Maybe just to establish the habit?
[12:41:54] <johnbender> making changes to it requires me to go through ... 7 files?
[12:42:00] * johnbender shrugs
[12:42:04] <johnbender> onward and upward!
[12:42:09] <Wilto> Yeah, I’m with you there.
[12:42:43] <Wilto> Six of one, half a dozen of the other.
[12:43:28] <Wilto> Speaking of the builder, Im’ma go make that happen.

[12:49:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Updated and DRY’d transition/3D-transform support tests for Firefox. - Mat Marquis
[12:50:14] <Wilto> I would not mind some eyes on that new test, if anyone has five minutes to burn.
[12:53:19] <Wilto> Again, I put borders on things for a living. I shouldn’t be allowed near “objects” and “functions” and such.
[12:59:29] <imjoshdean> Wilto: isn't that cute; he thinks he's programmers.
[12:59:35] <Wilto> +1
[13:02:16] <Wilto> Hey, on download-builder: you guys think this should do a Modernizr thing, where the assembled source goes into a textarea?
[13:02:40] <gseguin> what's the point?
[13:02:53] <gseguin> I mean I built the service so it can do that
[13:03:05] <Wilto> I’unno. It could kick off a download, too.
[13:03:13] <Wilto> Either-or.
[13:03:17] <gseguin> but it's more like an eye-candy
[13:03:43] <gseguin> if you pull the make via XHR you'll get the content
[13:04:06] <gseguin> if you have an <a href to it, it will download the file
[13:04:36] <Wilto> Yeah. I just didn’t know if anyone had a preference.
[13:17:26] <johnbender> testing update
[13:17:33] <johnbender> listview is failing with /js
[13:17:40] <johnbender> so that's not a deps issue it seems
[13:17:49] <johnbender> more to come
[13:20:13] <Wilto> Godspeed, sir.

[13:38:12] <Wilto> “Dried?” “DRYed?” “DRY’d?” These are the questions that keep me awake at night.
[13:54:59] <imjoshdean> Wilto: DRY-ed or something similar. It's an acronym, not a full on word.
[13:55:23] <Wilto> I might do a Shakespearean “DRY’ed.”
[13:55:50] <Wilto> “Thine code art DRY’ed” or however one speaks British.
[13:56:20] <imjoshdean> Wilto: Very carefully.

[14:32:12] <Wilto> Is that the fated commit, johnbender?
[14:32:50] <johnbender> fated in what sense?
[14:33:05] <johnbender> it solves one part of one of the test suite failures
[14:33:12] <johnbender> if that's what you mean
[14:34:50] <Wilto> Yeah, didn’t know if that meant the test was sorted.
[14:35:22] <Wilto> Hey gseguin, you still around?
[14:35:27] <gseguin> yup
[14:35:47] <gseguin> 'sup?
[14:36:04] <Wilto> Made a little something: http://filamentgroup.com/jqm/builder/
[14:36:16] <Wilto> It looks like a couple of build-specific things are being included, though.
[14:36:54] <Wilto> “order.js” and “jquery.mobile.js”.
[14:37:09] <gseguin> in the dep map ?
[14:37:14] <gseguin> yes
[14:37:21] <Wilto> Ah, it’s expected.
[14:37:31] <gseguin> I iterate through all *.js files in the baseUrl dir
[14:37:50] <gseguin> you could filter on whether they have a label or not
[14:38:17] <gseguin> also I would treat the jquery dep in particular case
[14:38:45] <gseguin> as to not lead the user into thinking that they're getting jquery as part of their bundle
[14:39:14] <Wilto> Yeah, I was thinking about that, too.
[14:39:32] <Wilto> That’s cool—I can omit those files easy enough on this side. As long as it’s expected behavior.
[14:39:47] <gseguin> yep it is
[14:40:06] <Wilto> I assume the metadata parsing is… label-independent? Like, could I add “grouping” under label/description?
[14:40:13] <Wilto> Or is that something you have to specifically alow?
[14:40:27] <gseguin> unfortunately not yet
[14:40:27] <Wilto> s/alow/allow
[14:40:33] * gseguin is ashamed
[14:40:44] <gseguin> but that was definitely a todo
[14:40:56] <gseguin> you can do PR :P
[14:41:05] <Wilto> DAMMIT GHISLAIN
[14:41:19] <Wilto> Nah, no worries, man.
[14:41:39] <gseguin> coming soon though
[14:41:44] <Wilto> I just gotta sort out how I’m gonna group/order these things at some point. For now, something is pretty much working.
[14:41:59] <Wilto> Not especially pretty, but working.
[14:42:00] <gseguin> I just need my daughters to give me a little free time this weekend
[14:43:50] <Wilto> Get those kids GitHub accounts, man. Put ’em to work.
[14:46:34] <gseguin> heh :)
[14:54:27] <Wilto> gseguin: If it’s easier than making the meta info completely flexible, I’m thinking we’ll likely only need two more things in there: “group”, and “required”
[14:54:46] <Wilto> That make sense?
[14:55:58] <Wilto> I can’t really imagine much else of use.
[14:58:03] <Wilto> “group”, “required”, “here_is_a_link_to_an_unrelated_animated_gif”?
[14:58:51] <johnbender> Wilto: why the change from prop to attr in checkboxradio
[14:58:52] <johnbender> ?
[14:59:04] <Wilto> It un-broke stuff.
[14:59:12] <johnbender> there's a failure there in the test suite
[14:59:14] <Wilto> The underlying checkboxes weren’t getting checked.
[14:59:17] <Wilto> Oh, what the hell.
[14:59:28] <Wilto> I’m on it.
[14:59:50] <johnbender> Wilto: quick note too, don't worry about commenting stuff out. just remove it
[14:59:55] <johnbender> that's why we have source controll
[14:59:58] <Wilto> Woah, yeah, that isn’t _not_ broken.
[15:00:12] <Wilto> Heh. Old habits.
[15:00:16] <johnbender> *control
[15:00:48] <johnbender> Wilto: the issue is the the :checked selector doesn't pick up the checkboxes now
[15:00:52] <johnbender> for whatever reason
[15:00:55] <johnbender> we've had issues with this before
[15:01:02] <Wilto> …That seems strange.
[15:01:04] <johnbender> and according to the jquery core docs checked is a boolean attribute
[15:01:10] <johnbender> which means we're supposed to use prop
[15:01:11] <gseguin> Wilto: I want to make it flexible
[15:01:41] <Wilto> johnbender: Hm. Alright, I’ll look into this now.
[15:05:16] <johnbender> Wilto: hmm
[15:05:26] <johnbender> Wilto: the docs seem to suggest that you can't set the value with prop
[15:05:29] <Wilto> Swapping that line back breaks it in, y’know, reality.
[15:05:36] <Wilto> Maybe the test just needs updating..?
[15:05:42] <johnbender> though that's odd given we had it there for a good long while
[15:05:52] <Wilto> I was thinking it might be a 1.7.1 change.
[15:06:07] <johnbender> Wilto: well the :checked selector is failing in ff and chrome
[15:06:24] <johnbender> which is eh, well, crappy
[15:06:31] <johnbender> let me take another look
[15:06:33] <Wilto> It is Not Ideal, no.
[15:06:44] <Wilto> It’s cool; you got test stuff to sort. I can swing this, I’m sure.
[15:07:12] <johnbender> Wilto: nah let me take a look
[15:07:16] <johnbender> this is going to bother me
[15:07:27] <Wilto> Hah—I understand, man.
[15:10:03] <Wilto> Huh. :checked is working for me, in Chrome.
[15:10:34] <johnbender> Wilto: failing for me in both chrome and ff
[15:10:38] <Wilto> wat
[15:11:15] <Wilto> I mean, I just slapped “console.log( $this.is( ":checked" ) );” ~ line 155.
[15:11:36] <johnbender> Wilto: I have a debugger dropped into the test itself
[15:11:52] <johnbender> the element has the checked="checked" according to .html() of the parent
[15:11:55] <Wilto> You and your “professional web developer”-y ways.
[15:12:17] <johnbender> fails on chrome for my mac too
[15:12:23] <Wilto> Likewise on mine—checked="checked". What the hell is goin’ on here?
[15:12:28] <johnbender> jquerymobile.com/test/tests/unit/checkboxradio/
[15:12:52] <johnbender> prop( 'checked' ) is false
[15:13:07] <johnbender> something is very wrong
[15:14:15] <Wilto> …Yeah, I’m lost.
[15:15:08] <Wilto> prop( 'checked' ) and input.is( ':checked' ) are both working in jquery.mobile.forms.checkboxradio.js.
[15:15:20] <johnbender> how so?
[15:15:58] <Wilto> At the start of the vclick binding, I just added:
[15:15:58] <Wilto> console.log( input.is( ":checked" ) ); console.log( input.prop( "checked" ) );
[15:16:09] <Wilto> And they’re both toggling correctly when I click around.
[15:18:35] <Wilto> I wanna say this is due to ghosts.
[15:19:53] <johnbender> well
[15:19:58] <johnbender> this is ... eh bad
[15:20:23] <johnbender> so I went into jQuery.pop and dropped in some logging statements
[15:20:41] <johnbender> the elem[ name ] they use returns false
[15:20:57] <Wilto> …Core bug?
[15:21:05] <johnbender> seems unlikely
[15:21:16] <Wilto> _Ghosts_.
[15:21:55] <Wilto> …Should I roll this back to passing the tests, and see if I can sort the issue otherwise?
[15:25:06] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm going to do a quick bisect
[15:25:14] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #397: STILL FAILING in 11 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/397/
[15:25:15] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Added meta information for download builder.
[15:25:15] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: guarantee the page reset in the listview tests has completed before continuing
[15:25:16] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Added meta info to jQuery Core file.
[15:25:17] <johnbender> just to make sure it's not something else
[15:25:55] <Wilto> Cool.
[15:26:00] <johnbender> once we get this one nailed down we'll be down to 2 failing tests
[15:26:01] <johnbender> err
[15:26:05] <johnbender> two failing test suites :/
[15:28:40] <Wilto> Sooomething is weird here.
[15:29:36] <johnbender> bisect isn't going to work with the failing state of the tests as the were merged :(
[15:29:39] <johnbender> sigh
[15:33:15] <Wilto> …this doesn’t make any sense.
[15:43:33] <johnbender> Wilto: well I've found where it's happening
[15:43:37] <johnbender> but it's not yet clear why
[15:43:38] <johnbender> lol
[15:43:42] <Wilto> Hit me.
[15:43:59] <Wilto> Because that’s kind of where I’m at, too. I get what’s happening, but I have zero idea why it’s happening.
[15:44:03] <johnbender> self._getInputSet().not( input ).removeAttr( "checked" );
[15:44:23] <Wilto> wat
[15:44:24] <johnbender> but the set of things that should have that attribute removed is correct
[15:44:51] <Wilto> Waaait wait wait.
[15:44:56] <Wilto> I have an idea.
[15:44:56] <johnbender> if you debug or log the value of input.prop( "checked" ) before and after you'll see it starts true and finishes false
[15:51:14] <johnbender> Wilto: interested in sharing?
[15:51:29] <Wilto> —oh, sorry. False alarm, then got distracted right away.
[15:52:07] <Wilto> I thought it might have something to do with us scrapping the attr completely rather than setting it to false and letting jQ scrap it for us?
[15:52:19] <johnbender> Wilto: checked has to be removed
[15:52:23] <johnbender> it's presence == true
[15:52:56] <Wilto> Right. If I remember right, though, .attr( "checked", false ) removes it.
[15:53:03] <Wilto> Which… I mean, yes.
[15:53:16] <Wilto> Same as removing the attribute manually; no additional shenanigans inbetween.
[15:53:22] <Wilto> I was hoping for shenanigans.
[15:55:50] <Wilto> what in the actual hell
[15:56:28] <Wilto> console.log( input[ 0 ].getAttribute('checked') ); // "checked"
[15:56:28] <Wilto> console.log( $(input[ 0 ]).attr('checked') ); // "undefined"
[15:56:55] <johnbender> ye
[15:56:56] <johnbender> yep
[15:57:28] <gseguin> Wilto: I was hitting the same problem last night
[15:57:40] <johnbender> that shit cray http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lrtw69Uxxd1qz4mo8o1_500.jpg
[15:57:53] <Wilto> _Nice_.
[15:58:23] <gseguin> couldn't wrap my head around it
[15:58:51] <johnbender> fails in safari too
[15:59:07] <johnbender> it's like we've confused the browser as to the state of the object somehow
[16:01:25] <johnbender> I had this issue originally with chrome and it turned out to be an issue with chromes dev tools
[16:01:28] <johnbender> but this is everywhere
[16:01:29] <johnbender> ff
[16:01:31] <johnbender> safari
[16:01:32] <johnbender> chrome
[16:01:57] <Wilto> Baffling.
[16:05:37] <Wilto> !?
[16:05:57] <Wilto> console.log( $(input[0]).is( ":checked" ) );
[16:05:57] <Wilto> if ( $(input[0]).is( ":checked" ) ) { alert("This never shows up."); }
[16:06:18] <Wilto> ⌘Q⌘Q⌘Q⌘Q⌘Q
[16:10:26] <johnbender> yah I don't know what to make of that
[16:11:54] <Wilto> console.log( input[0].getAttribute('checked') ); // checked
[16:11:54] <Wilto> console.log( $(input[0]).attr('checked') ); // undefined
[16:11:54] <Wilto> console.log( $(input[0]).prop('checked') ); // false
[16:11:54] <Wilto> console.log( $(input[0]).is(':checked') ); // false
[16:12:21] <Wilto> is it this guys have i actually lost my mind this time
[16:12:25] <gseguin> did you try to revert the test to not using requirejs to see if that changed anything?
[16:12:43] <johnbender> no, but why in gods name that would matter is beyond me
[16:12:49] * johnbender goes to try it out
[16:13:26] <gseguin> at that point it's time to try things that make even less sense that what we're observing
[16:13:33] <Wilto> It’s gotta be something like that.
[16:14:24] <johnbender> stil failing
[16:14:26] <Wilto> I mean, the original issue can’t have been around long—we’d have heard a lot more about checkboxes/radios not working.
[16:15:00] <gseguin> johnbender: did you bisect?
[16:15:06] <johnbender> gseguin: I can't
[16:15:14] <gseguin> oh why?
[16:15:23] <johnbender> gseguin: there are huge test failures in all sorts of places through history
[16:15:46] <Wilto> Something something reference to my high school career.
[16:15:49] <johnbender> do determining if something is good or bad at a given commit is impossible
[16:15:55] <gseguin> even running just that test ?
[16:16:01] <johnbender> s/do determinging/so determining/
[16:16:02] <johnbender> ys
[16:16:03] <johnbender> yes
[16:16:08] <johnbender> holy crap I can't type
[16:16:36] <Wilto> Asked some of the core dudes.
[16:16:41] <Wilto> Looking like a bug.
[16:16:55] <johnbender> Wilto: it's not core though
[16:16:58] <Wilto> I’m gonna drop 1.7.0 in there and see what happens.
[16:17:04] <johnbender> well
[16:17:07] <johnbender> I guess it could be
[16:17:11] <Wilto> That set of logs I pasted in there seems like it is.
[16:17:18] <Wilto> —Did those come through?
[16:17:23] <johnbender> their method of retrieving the attr is elem[ "checked" ]
[16:17:39] <johnbender> which appears to be failing in this case
[16:18:41] <Wilto> I just don’t see how we could be breaking this.
[16:23:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/yyibJQ
[16:23:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] temprorary fix for failing checkbox radio test - John Bender
[16:23:13] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: ^ there's a todo in there but for now I just grabbed the value with getAttribute in the test
[16:23:24] <Wilto> Cool, cool.
[16:23:27] * johnbender moves on with life
[16:23:35] <Wilto> I CAN’T MOVE ON I MUST KNOW
[16:24:29] <johnbender> that leaves me with the navigation tests to sort out
[16:24:52] <johnbender> I think those are transition issues
[16:24:56] <johnbender> and then we should be done
[16:26:17] <Wilto> High five, man.
[16:27:57] <johnbender> hmm
[16:28:09] <johnbender> jquerymobile.com/test/ leaves me with a gray screen on my android :(
[16:28:44] <Wilto> oh no
[16:29:00] <gseguin> I don't think eddiemonge has done the redirection to the cdn
[16:29:01] <Wilto> I’m out of the office; I don’t have one on me.
[16:30:14] <gseguin> this is still pointing at the dev env
[16:30:37] <johnbender> not sure what that means
[16:30:44] <gseguin> try code.jquery.com/latest/demos
[16:31:04] <gseguin> it means you're still downloading all the micro modules and the split css files
[16:31:16] <Wilto> That shouldn’t choke Android, though.
[16:31:22] <Wilto> I mean, it wasn’t.
[16:31:54] <gseguin> I meant http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/
[16:34:39] <johnbender> gseguin: I thought that, but it never finished
[16:34:45] <johnbender> it just stayed grey
[16:34:51] <Wilto> “Forget it, Jake. It’s Android.”
[16:35:03] <gseguin> yeah that: ^
[16:35:08] <johnbender> :/
[16:36:10] <Wilto> Anyone else around and Android-ed up that can confirm?
[16:36:23] <Wilto> No visible errors anywhere.
[16:36:44] <johnbender> gseguin: code.jquery.com worked fine
[16:36:55] <johnbender> or rather it worked
[16:37:48] <gseguin> though I don't know what's running on cdn
[16:37:59] <gseguin> not what I worked on, that's for sure
[16:38:23] <johnbender> so what happened to jquerymobile.com/test/?
[16:38:42] <Wilto> Oh, johnbender: try clearing your browser cache on there.
[16:38:44] <gseguin> eddie was supposed to redirect it to cdn/mobile/latest/demos
[16:38:54] <Wilto> Something was _very_ weird about caching for me on Android, yesterday.
[16:39:05] <Wilto> On /test, I mean.
