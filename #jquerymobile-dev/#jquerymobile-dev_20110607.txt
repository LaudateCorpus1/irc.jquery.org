[08:02:16] <toddparker> Good morning all
[08:02:29] <toddparker> anyone have items to this week's agenda?
[08:02:48] <toddparker> I want to look at what we need to do to button up beta 1
[08:05:06] <toddparker> hey _nickel
[08:13:47] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:32:24] <toddparker> hey gseguin!
[08:32:35] <gseguin> hi toddparker
[08:32:39] <toddparker> i need to get caught up with what everyone's been up to
[08:32:54] <toddparker> and note what y'all what to discuss in the meeting today
[08:33:03] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[08:33:19] <gseguin> kinblas landed the fix for nested lists which I had been working on
[08:34:02] <gseguin> the blocker that was assigned to me got re-opened, I need to look at it today
[10:12:48] <toddparker> gseguin, i saw that. good to see those changes finally land
[10:12:49] <bot-t> (229 hours ago) <StevenBlack> tell toddparker I made a local branch with jquery.ui.widget.js from the v 1.8.13 tag and the jQuery Mobile unit test story is not good though the errors appear neatly segmented by type. Let's get the widget back in sync asap.
[10:12:49] <bot-t> (111 hours ago) <StevenBlack> tell toddparker: Todd, I've been working form a plan you OK'ed. Here is the plan: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Temporary-page:-Feature-spec-for-$.mobile.removePage I am in-limbo at Step-1 which is, "Create a stand-alone function named $.mobile.removePage() packaged in jquery.mobile.navigation.js along with unit tests packaged with the navigation unit tests.". Please advise.
[10:12:54] <toddparker> sorry it took so long!
[10:13:54] <gseguin> toddparker: np
[10:32:54] <kinblas> wow, the android emulator still sucks on a fast machine (i7)
[10:34:07] <kinblas> even with 8gigs of memory ... sigh
[10:35:10] <kinblas> literally 5 seconds between each character I type
[10:37:57] <toddparker> wow
[10:38:01] <toddparker> it is pretty bad
[10:38:09] <toddparker> not that bad for me on os x
[10:38:19] <toddparker> win 7 is even worse if you can believe it
[10:38:30] <toddparker> starting an agenda here guys: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kqZVgb9fcvv_hVWV8Vr62wgQB6sLJyDj1UDMFFiGbdA/edit
[10:38:48] <toddparker> copied the nav stuff over from last time
[10:41:09] <toddparker> so kin is this double vclick an issue? saw you commented
[10:41:09] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1787
[10:45:43] <kinblas> toddparker: it's not an issue for us?
[10:45:51] <kinblas> I'd have to see what he's doing
[10:48:01] <toddparker> yeah, is it a bug or operator error?
[10:48:32] <kinblas> toddparker: it seems like operator error, but this stuff is so dependent on device  being tested on and layout used
[10:49:45] <toddparker> sure, ok
[10:49:59] <toddparker> i created a beta 1 milestone and am tagging issues to it
[10:50:07] <toddparker> we can review on the call
[10:50:48] <kinblas> toddparker: we need to discuss timeframes
[10:50:59] <toddparker> we do
[10:51:02] <kinblas> I'm getting questions from all over about when is beta 1, when is release
[10:51:19] <toddparker> it really should go out late this week if we can swing it
[10:51:31] <toddparker> what's your availability and thoughts on that?
[10:51:37] <kinblas> also, if there's a way we can let each other know when we're  off on other client/projects
[10:51:59] <kinblas> I'm unavailable *ALL* of July
[10:52:10] <toddparker> think we should all try to check in here every morning with an update on availability for the day
[10:52:21] <toddparker> :(
[10:52:35] <toddparker> we gotta work you like a dawg until then
[10:52:43] <kinblas> yeah sounds like a good idea ... or maybe email ... the bad thing about IRC is you don't see previous messages if you weren't logged on
[10:53:02] <gseguin> unless you have an irccloud account
[10:53:06] <toddparker> yeah
[10:53:12] <toddparker>  i just leave it open always
[10:53:15] <toddparker> until it crashes
[10:53:24] <kinblas> toddparker: not possible for me since I'm on a laptop
[10:53:30] <gseguin> same here
[10:53:45] <kinblas> btw party at gseguin's on thursday
[10:53:48] <kinblas> :-)
[10:54:02] <gseguin> woohoo!
[10:54:10] <toddparker> yee ha
