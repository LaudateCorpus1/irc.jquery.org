[08:24:38] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:25:13] <gseguin> todd_: the wp link is still 404ing
[08:26:54] <gseguin> toddparker: good morning! the wp link is still 404ing for me
[08:41:23] <toddparker> hey
[08:41:37] <gseguin> hey
[08:41:49] <toddparker> can you try again: http://jquerymobile.com/?p=785&preview=true
[08:42:19] <gseguin> same: "Not Found
[08:42:19] <gseguin> Apologies, but the page you requested could not be found. Perhaps searching will help."
[08:42:26] <toddparker> really odd
[08:42:44] <toddparker> if you're logged in, can you  see the list of posts in the wp admin?
[08:42:45] <gseguin> I'm logged in and I can see the draft in the list of posts
[08:42:51] <gseguin> yep
[08:42:56] <gseguin> but can't view it
[08:43:00] <toddparker> if you hit preview, is the url different?
[08:43:09] <toddparker> what the heck
[08:43:15] <gseguin> there is no preview link on hover
[08:43:28] <gseguin> the other posts have a "view" link on hover
[08:44:23] <toddparker> try now
[08:44:34] <toddparker> i upgraded your role
[08:45:17] <gseguin> yup, working
[08:45:27] <toddparker> cool
[08:45:32] <gseguin> thanks
[08:45:52] <toddparker> np
[11:17:14] <joshontheweb> so im a little confused, there are docs for things like scrollview that don't appear to be in the jquery.mobile core
[11:17:43] <joshontheweb> how do you implement these experiments?
[11:33:46] <_nickel> scottjehl: ^
[12:09:55] <scottjehl> joshontheweb - which docs are you referring to?
[12:10:16] <scottjehl> there shouldn't be info on scrollview in the main docs (it's not officially supported)
[12:11:27] <joshontheweb> yeah, showed up in a search, perhaps you can't get there from the main docs like you say. http://jquerymobile.com/test/experiments/scrollview/scrollview-direction.html
[12:13:48] <scottjehl> ah, yeah we should really move "experiments" into a branch
[12:14:02] <scottjehl> in general, anything in that directory is sortof a playground
[12:14:10] <scottjehl> correct: can't get there from docs
[12:14:27] <scottjehl> if you have questions though, you can ping kinblas about it
[15:14:00] <kinblas> gseguin: fyi, I got the nested lists to work with embedded pages in my branch
[15:14:33] <kinblas> gseguin: it was a problem in loadPage() thats been there a while
[15:14:43] <kinblas> well ... loadPage is new, I meant the loading code
[15:17:22] <gseguin> kinblas: Woohoo!
[15:17:46] <gseguin> yeah that's what wasn't working, my test file is like that
[15:18:05] <kinblas> gseguin: so we handle this:
[15:18:19] <kinblas> http://localhost/jblas/path-tests/#&ui-page=0-2
[15:18:20] <kinblas> and
[15:18:31] <kinblas> http://localhost/jblas/path-tests/#embedded-page-2&ui-page=0-2
[15:18:42] <gseguin> great!
[15:18:43] <kinblas> 1st example is the default page of the app with no id
[15:18:48] <gseguin> yep
[15:18:52] <kinblas> the 2nd is an example of an embedded page with an id
[15:19:25] <kinblas> that was the last of my bugs to fix ... now on to the unit tests
[15:19:27] <kinblas> which are red
[15:19:29] * kinblas sighs
[15:19:40] <kinblas> mostly a bunch of string compares I need to fix up
[15:19:48] <gseguin> do you have a unit test for that embedded page one?
[15:21:16] <kinblas> no but I'll add one
[15:21:21] <kinblas> unless you have it already?
[15:21:28] <kinblas> I just sync'd with the head to pick up your changes
[15:22:55] <gseguin> well I don't have one but I submitted a pull request with multiple level nested lists: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1782
[15:23:18] <gseguin> which got merged, so you have that as a base in master
[15:29:05] <scottjehl> hey Kin!
[15:29:22] <scottjehl> we were wondering what the status of your branch is at this point?
[15:29:29] <scottjehl> still working some things out?
[15:35:00] <scottjehl> kinblas: ^
[15:35:48] <scottjehl> gotta run. talk later!
