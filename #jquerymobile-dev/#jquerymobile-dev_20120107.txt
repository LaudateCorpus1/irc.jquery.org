[10:28:47] <imjoshdean> Out of curiosity, though I highly doubt it, has anyone looked at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3383 and been able to reproduce it?
[10:28:47] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3383 on jquery-mobile, reported by adammessinger (2d, 36m ago): In dialogs, range inputs not fully enhanced to sliders
[10:36:24] <imjoshdean> Nevermind, I can reproduce it, but it seems to be fixed in master
[10:37:19] <Wilto> Alright, got a working first pass at the download builder put together.
[10:37:34] <Wilto> Oh, whassup imjoshdean? Everything sorted?
[10:38:03] <imjoshdean> Wilto: issue exists in 1.0, but something resolved it in the master branch, so I assume it'll be good for 1.0.1
[10:38:13] <Wilto> MY WORK HERE IS DONE
[10:38:21] <imjoshdean> high fives all around.
[10:38:52] <Wilto> No big shake-ups between 1.0 and 1.0.1, but tons of little fixes here and there—definitely one to grab.
[13:27:39] <gseguin> Hey Wilto, that's awesome do you have a url for me to look at it?
