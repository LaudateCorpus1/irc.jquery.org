[01:16:20] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi opened issue #5414: Nav back and popups broken on IE10 and Opera Mobile/Desktop  02http://git.io/FwTbwg
[01:27:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh no! Not those too!
[01:27:36] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[01:27:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lemme guess: When you go back, it goes all the way to the start page.
[01:27:42] <uGoMobi> good morning
[01:27:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[01:28:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can you try disabling pushState? It should stop happening.
[01:28:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah when you click a second time you go back to homepage (= two history items back)
[01:29:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suspect that if you traverse 15 pages, you go back 15 pages.
[01:30:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[01:30:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For some reason, when pushState is turned on, it doesn't properly create history items. So, the only items you have are the empty tab, the start page, and the final page.
[01:30:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: At least that's my experience with iOS Chrome.
[01:30:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I am going test with pushState disabled
[01:30:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, if these other two behave identically, then that might be an indication of a more general problem.
[01:40:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you were right... no problem with pushStateEnabled = false 
[01:57:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep. So, it's a problem with the pushState implem.
[01:57:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe that in some places the popstate event is swallowed and re-emitted.
[01:58:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Some browsers may take that as "Oh? You swallowed it?" Well, I guess you don't wanna go anywhere.
[01:58:25] <_|Nix|_> "
[01:59:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, looks like that
[02:34:36] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #224: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/224/
[02:36:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Man! On Opera/Windows, I can open one popup and then no more.
[02:37:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I couldn't open any popup at all on Opera/Win
[02:37:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: or do you mean with pustState disabled?
[02:37:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. Not with pushState disabled.
[02:37:56] * uGoMobi ah ok
[02:37:58] <_|Nix|_> Things are really fux0red up with pushState on.
[02:38:22] * uGoMobi yeah for sure
[02:42:45] <_|Nix|_> Well, fork(2) me ... it works flawlessly on Opera/Windoze with pushState turned off.
[02:43:05] <agcolom> toddmparker: uGoMobi johnbender RWhitbeck gseguin|away _|Nix|_ arschmitz JasonDScott___ scottjehl______ Just to let you know that I will be traveling back to Paris this evening and will be on the train at the time of the meeting today...
[02:43:39] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Have a safe trip!
[02:45:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we can wrap all these issues up into one: pushState is broken ...
[02:45:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good idea
[02:46:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How would I do that? Should I make a new issue and close all of these?
[02:47:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes or keep the issue with most info/comments open, click edit to change title
[02:48:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you want to keep iOS popup ticket open i can copy/paste the info from my ticket there
[02:49:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think I will close it and make 5414 the umbrella issue.
[02:49:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: perfect
[02:59:11] <_|Nix|_> I just wish there was a browser on Linux that was broken like the ones on Windoze/iOS/Android, so I don't have to oscillate between two computers ...
[03:01:00] * uGoMobi virtual machines :)
[03:01:04] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... Opera 12.12 is also available for Linux ...
[03:01:18] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, but I don't exactly have Windoze 7 installation media.
[03:01:36] <_|Nix|_> Lessee if it's h0rked on Linux as well.
[03:01:40] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[03:03:30] <_|Nix|_> Great success!
[03:03:42] <_|Nix|_> Opera 12.12/Linux is h0rked! Yaaay!
[03:04:59] <_|Nix|_> Interesting ... the back button breaks only the first time you click back. Afterwards, it works fine.
[03:07:05] <_|Nix|_> Does Opera have dev tools like Chrome?
[03:09:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: dragonfly
[03:10:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ctrl + shift + i
[03:23:06] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15pillex opened issue #5415: Opening Listview Links into Listview (Code / Demo)  02http://git.io/nRCZ-A
[03:36:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: there is something with demos source view we need to look into 
[03:36:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you go to this demo http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/swipe/swipe-list.html
[03:37:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: 1. open the swipe list demo 2. click refresh (right btn in header) 3. go to intro page (left btn in header)
[03:39:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the source view will show the enhanced markup now because the source view is created when you click the view source button
[03:42:42] <uGoMobi> hmm... on /test/docs/demos/ you don't get to see a view source button at all at the moment
[03:43:08] <uGoMobi> I noticed the issue local
[03:53:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: combining jqm-demos.js and view-source.js currently results in this script src in the build: <script src="../_assets/js/jquery.mobile.js"></script>
[04:08:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know.
[04:08:46] <_|Nix|_> I've been looking at it, but it needs some grunt manipulation.
[04:08:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It looks waaay too complicated.
[04:09:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've been trying to replicate the way grunt uses requirejs to create jquery.mobile.js, but I have a lot more to learn about it.
[04:10:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I understand
[04:10:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: should we change it and just link to both scripts for the time being?
[04:10:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[04:10:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not a bad idea.
[04:12:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I will make the change and just leave the index.php with a comment in it that it isn't used yet
[04:13:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.

[04:59:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[04:59:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: dosent sounds like its been a great morning so far lol
[05:04:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: "Morning"? Try "day" ...
[05:04:10] <arschmitz> sorry time difference lol
[05:04:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its only 8am here lol
[05:04:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've been at this for the past 5 hours ...
[05:04:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know.
[05:05:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so is it your feeling its our use of popstate or a broken browser implementation? 
[05:11:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think it's us. We were using popstate in 1.2.0 and it's working fine on all these browsers.
[05:12:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When it was exclusively Chrome/iOS, I figured, fringe browser -> bad implem ... but now ...
[05:12:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ah ok well thats both good and bad means it should be fixable but also means we broke shit!
[05:19:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ugh i have to go to a stupid self improvment class in an hour... worst idea in the history of my company... Starting to make everyone go to self improvment classes once a week  stuff like goal setting, starting the morning right, motivation,staying positive, self talk, self image ... 
[05:19:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: TBH I still don't consider the list of broken browsers significant.
[05:19:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe you can teach them a thing or two.
[05:19:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no not really none of them have any sort of real market share yet
[05:20:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: lol its this old guy that teaches them all and they are like 2 hours each
[05:20:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are you allowed to bring/use a laptop?
[05:20:43] <arschmitz> no :( 
[05:20:49] <_|Nix|_> Of course not ...
[05:21:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: such a waste of time
[05:21:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Attempt to illustrate a direct negative impact on the company's bottom line ...
[05:21:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That'll learn 'em ...
[05:21:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thing is most of them make sense like they have sales training and customer service ones for sales people / service people.
[05:22:17] <arschmitz> but then for people where thoes dont make sense (like me) they are just self improvment BS

[07:55:19] <Wilto> Morning, guys.
[07:55:26] <arschmitz> Morning Wilto
[07:59:02] <arschmitz> Wilto: i looked into the support test failure a bit and narrowed it down to the cause but thought you might have a bit more insight
[08:00:48] <Wilto> What’s busted, now?
[08:00:50] <Wilto> Also: did I break it?
[08:01:02] <arschmitz> csstransform3d and yes
[08:01:21] <arschmitz> :)
[08:01:34] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.support.js#L65
[08:01:56] <arschmitz> when you added the unprefixed option in addition to moz
[08:02:06] <arschmitz> it made the test start passing on ie8 and 9
[08:07:45] <Wilto> Aw, dammit.
[08:07:49] <Wilto> —Wait, I thought I sorted that.
[08:10:41] <arschmitz> Wilto: apparently not csstransitions was busted too but i fixed that already
[08:10:59] <Wilto> Something is amiss.
[08:11:19] <arschmitz> wilto lol on the csstransitions one you changed it to kick out ie9 but not 8 and 7
[08:11:26] <arschmitz> so that was a really easy fix
[08:11:28] <Wilto> whaaat
[08:11:42] <Wilto> 7/8 should never have qualified in the first place.
[08:11:49] <Wilto> Man, my bad.
[08:12:03] <Wilto> I could’ve sworn I re-checked those, though.
[08:12:28] <arschmitz> Wilto: not a biggy but i wasent real sure about the csstransform3d one though because that one looks right 
[08:13:15] <arschmitz> it seems perspective is a valid style on 8 & 9?
[08:14:31] <arschmitz> if i remove the unprefixed option the test works perfect again
[08:15:42] <Wilto> …
[08:16:01] <Wilto> This makes me question the viability of “perspective” for the test.
[08:17:24] <Wilto> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5661671/detecting-transform-translate3d-support might be a little more ¡robusto!.
[08:20:04] <arschmitz> Wilto: yeah its pretty clear its not working in all cases
[08:23:36] <arschmitz> Wilto: modernizer must have updated
[08:23:53] <arschmitz> Wilto: their tests seem to work properly on ie8 and 9

[08:55:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: nice!
[08:56:32] <arschmitz> yeah ill leave you with the hard one not sure if you saw the issue _|Nix|_ is working on but popstate is pretty broken 
[08:57:06] <arschmitz> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5414
[08:57:57] <johnbender> arschmitz: ah
[09:01:04] <arschmitz> so toddmparker: told me the other day he wont be around for a meeting today but he still wants us to have one with out him

[09:03:14] <johnbender> jzaefferer: phantom js issue :(
[09:06:17] <Wilto> So, arschmitz, we square now?
[09:06:37] <Wilto> Should I look into switching that test over to somethin’ a little more solid-feeling, or you think we’re good?
[09:07:12] <arschmitz> Wilto: no the fix i was talking about with johnbender: was for the transitions
[09:07:25] <arschmitz> they were completely breaking nav in ie8
[09:07:51] <arschmitz> Wilto: thats fixed but cssTransform3d is still broken
[09:08:13] <arschmitz> Wilto: its just not causing any nav issues at the moment
[09:09:12] <arschmitz> Wilto: might want to see what modernizer is doing now though because their tests are working for me 
[09:13:55] <Wilto> Ah-hah.
[09:14:46] <Wilto> from the depths of hell I summon jlembeck
[09:14:57] <Wilto> Aw man, you’re already here.
[09:15:34] <Wilto> jlembeck: Our cssTransform3d test is ’effed; I’m gonna take that on now, what with my having broken it and all.
[09:15:55] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ I'm doing a little desk cleanup and then I promised I would do a quick code review
[09:15:59] <johnbender> after that I'll look at the nav bug
[09:16:20] <Wilto> johnbender: Wait, wouldn’t that potentially be caused by cssTransform3d?
[09:16:42] <arschmitz> johnbender: no problem its not really in any major browsers mostly fringe ones at the moment
[09:17:18] <arschmitz> johnbender hmm right now i think the test is only broken in ie8 and 9 but you never know
[09:17:21] <Wilto> I was seeing this last time the test was busted.
[09:17:39] <arschmitz> johnbender: work checking 
[09:17:41] <arschmitz> worth
[09:17:44] <Wilto> oh okay I’m a clod we’re already talking about this
[09:18:00] <arschmitz> its as simple switch to test
[09:18:32] <arschmitz> i dont have time this second im heading to lunch
[09:18:43] <arschmitz> but either when i get back or after the meeting ill check
[09:20:03] <arschmitz> Wilto: johnbender: im gone for the next hour or so but ill be back for meeting / to check that out
[09:20:38] <Wilto> arschmitz: “Word up,” as the kids are wont to say.
[09:22:26] <gseguin> johnbender: you're going to be proud of me, I'm using irssi
[09:25:01] <Wilto> Dibs on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5380
[09:25:12] <Wilto> All opposed, say “nay.”
[09:26:54] <Wilto> The dibs carries.
[09:37:33] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: screen + irssi = nirvana
[09:37:54] <Wilto> wat
[09:38:09] <Wilto> “The client of the future,” you say!
[09:38:22] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: screen -S freenode irssi -c freenode ... then, from anywhere, ssh -t user@host screen -dr freenode ...
[09:38:31] <Wilto> …Command line IRC, you say.
[09:38:41] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... and you will be one with the 'verse.
[09:38:41] <johnbender> ...
[09:38:47] <Wilto> is that… is that who I am, now
[09:38:54] <Wilto> is this what I have become
[09:38:57] <johnbender> Wilto: they may be releated
[09:39:06] <johnbender> but it looks like it affects popups too
[09:39:08] <johnbender> so I'm not sure
[09:39:29] <Wilto> johnbender: I think that checks out; popups rely on that test too.
[09:39:34] <Wilto> If I remember correctly.
[09:39:39] <johnbender> orly
[09:39:46] <johnbender> Wilto: that would explain why going back twice works
[09:39:51] <johnbender> I guess ...
[09:39:52] <johnbender> lol
[09:39:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The fallback transition for popups is calculated by a function shared with pages.
[09:40:05] <Wilto> johnbender: See also: http://wil.to/_/a-terrible-mistake.gif
[09:41:34] <Wilto> Heavily related.
[09:42:02] <Wilto> That makes sense, though: history is being changed, but the visibile page isn’t changing.
[09:43:25] <johnbender> Wilto: alright are you looking at that one on master?
[09:46:07] <Wilto> Yeah; I will be.
[09:50:03] <johnbender> Wilto: ok you might check into the nav on those platforms if you have time
[09:50:13] <johnbender> if you get a fix and those issues persiste let me know
[09:50:39] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5414
[09:50:42] <johnbender> you're assigned for now
[09:56:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. So, in Opera, pushState is enabled, so the hashchange handler does nothing, but a popstate event doesn't arrive, so the popstate handler also does nothing. Thus, _handleHashChange never gets called.
[09:56:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: just make sure that you've got the binding set up so it should fire regardless of the locks
[09:57:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I fell into that trap early in the test debugging
[09:57:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: since it eats the popstate
[09:57:15] <johnbender> and then triggers another
[09:57:19] <johnbender> in certain situations
[09:57:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I've got breakpoints on all the handlers, and the popstate handler simply doesn't fire.
[09:57:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can't fix that :/
[09:58:00] <johnbender> or we need to include it in the support test
[09:58:15] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: one thing to check
[09:58:19] <johnbender> well
[09:58:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... I guess it was working in 1.2.0 because _handleHashChange was doing the urlHistory maintenance.
[09:58:32] <johnbender> or one question you can answer is if the urls are different enough
[09:58:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah
[09:59:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that is, it was working by accident maybe?
[09:59:17] <johnbender> not sure
[09:59:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Is there some guarantee that a popstate precedes a hashchange - like, via the pushState spec or something?
[09:59:23] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I'm not there yet :)
[09:59:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: as far as the timing is concerned we don't make any assumptions in the new nav
[10:00:13] <gseguin> johnbender: you need help on something not super time sensitive?
[10:00:16] <johnbender> it either supports pushstate or we use the hashchange plugin
[10:00:21] <johnbender> gseguin: nope
[10:00:26] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm 
[10:00:41] <johnbender> uGoMobi: are there any JS issues that gseguin could look at?
[10:00:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, we do make the assumption that, if pushSate is enabled, then popstate events will arrive paired with hashchange events.
[10:01:05] <johnbender> gseguin: you could start on the upgrade to grunt <whatever the latest version is>
[10:01:14] <johnbender> I think there are some significant changes
[10:01:43] <gseguin> alright, looking into it
[10:02:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's true
[10:02:26] <johnbender> it does eat the hashchange
[10:02:54] <johnbender> or it will block the next event because of the hashchange lock
[10:03:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: come to think of it, that isn't really necessary
[10:03:21] <johnbender> might just be a hold over from adapting the old code
[10:04:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah nevermind
[10:04:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: popstate will be triggered in some cases by the hashchange
[10:04:57] <johnbender> so we have to handle that
[10:05:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: which brings us back to your question
[10:05:15] <johnbender> fucking browsers
[10:05:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Tell me about it.
[10:06:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: This is kinda like detailedEventCascade ... expect a hashchange and a popstate, but either one may be absent. Proceed when you have received both, or you have established that one of them will never arrive.
[10:07:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The problem is with the establishing part.
[10:07:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: supporting ios4 is the problem
[10:07:49] <uGoMobi> hey guys
[10:07:57] <johnbender> since we can't use pushstate instead of the hash alteration plus replacestate
[10:08:05] <johnbender> sigh
[10:08:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Aaaah, I see.
[10:08:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: because we have the two step process we have to eat that hashchange
[10:08:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's terrible.
[10:08:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes, I've spent many many hours of work dealing with that
[10:08:54] <johnbender> :/
[10:09:11] <uGoMobi> gseguin: maybe you want to look into this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5198
[10:09:36] <uGoMobi> gseguin: it affects your listview autocomplete demo
[10:11:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'll take a stab at it
[10:11:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Alright. GOod luck!
[10:14:07] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ok
[10:15:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I might also need your help with grunt. I'm trying to get it to use requirejs to concatenate two js files in docs/demos/_assets/js the way it creates jquery.mobile.js. To that end, I've copied build/tasks/js.js but for some reason it keeps wanting to include jquery.js, even though I've added jquery to the exclude list.
[10:16:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you just want to concat two files use the grunt concat task
[10:16:56] <johnbender> fairly sure that will work
[10:17:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's a good point.
[10:17:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can I run that task multiple times, each time with a different set of files?
[10:17:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It seems like these tasks only take a single set of configs.
[10:18:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think you can specify different sets of files as groups for concat
[10:18:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. I'll look into that. Thanks!
[10:18:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I would ask jzaefferer he knows more about it than I do
[10:18:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: let me look at something real fast
[10:18:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. I'll do that when I need to.
[10:19:02] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/johnbender/wield/blob/master/grunt.js#L18
[10:20:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was just gonna say it also concats the structure css, so yeah, it can generate multiple files.
[10:35:30] <_|Nix|_> So, if we're gonna have a meeting, are we gonna have an agenda too?
[10:40:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm, might just keep it informal since our fearless leader isn't here
[10:40:54] <gseguin> uGoMobi: so for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5198 should we just debounce?
[10:42:00] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah that sounds good
[10:42:53] <Wilto> We be weechattin’ now.
[10:42:59] <uGoMobi> gseguin: we bind to multiple events in textinput.js too... not sure if that causes issues too
[10:43:27] <Wilto> Should jlembeck and I jump in on the meeting, representing the Filamenteers?
[10:43:36] <Wilto> Which is what we’re called now. “The Filamenteers.”
[10:44:02] <johnbender> Wilto: yah
[10:44:05] <johnbender> we'll keep it fast
[10:44:08] <johnbender> I have the gavel
[10:44:18] <johnbender> gseguin: will you be around to open up the rooom>
[10:44:19] <johnbender> ?
[10:44:29] <johnbender> s/rooom>/room?/
[10:44:36] <gseguin> johnbender: yup
[10:44:39] <johnbender> cool
[10:44:42] <johnbender> going to get some tea
[10:44:42] <arschmitz> Wilto: if you could that would be great i have some panel questions
[10:45:55] <gseguin> uGoMobi: so what are you saying? That we don't debounce in textinput and we don't have that kind of issue?
[10:46:36] <Wilto> Sounds good. We doin’ a Google Hangout thing, or just chat?
[10:47:40] <gseguin> uGoMobi: actually we do debounce in textinput
[10:47:56] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ahaa
[10:48:34] <uGoMobi> didn't look at the code, just remember we bind to a lot of events for the textarea autogrow feature
[10:49:05] <gseguin> yup
[10:49:29] <gseguin> that debouncer code should go in a common place
[10:50:29] <uGoMobi> yeah that was what I was thinking about
[10:52:04] <Wilto> computer is on fire
[10:52:10] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The underscore library has a debounce function ... maybe we should too.
[10:53:24] <gseguin> or add a dependency on underscore
[10:53:27] * gseguin ducks
[10:53:36] <uGoMobi> Wilto: hit the back button
[10:53:56] <johnbender> that's my joke!
[10:53:57] <johnbender> :)
[10:54:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think underscore would add a lot of weight. Let's get them to adopt AMD instead.
[10:54:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... and depend like that.
[10:54:32] <Wilto> I’m no command line expert, but “login(57244,0x7fff7c463960) malloc: *** error for object 0x7fd815400340: pointer being freed was not allocated” don’t sound real good.
[10:54:47] <uGoMobi> johnbender: sorry for using your joke :D
[10:54:52] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Who said that?
[10:55:00] <Wilto> …iTerm
[10:55:04] <Wilto> And terminal.app.
[10:55:10] <Wilto> And then “[Process completed]”
[10:55:14] <Wilto> And then I cannot do anything.
[10:55:17] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: What were you running in that term.
[10:55:24] <_|Nix|_> ?
[10:55:29] <Wilto> Oh, it’s every time I open either. So.
[10:55:58] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Oh, OK. I think rxvt might have a Mac native version. That's a decent term.
[10:56:07] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Otherwise, get a real OS.
[10:56:17] <Wilto> ohhh buuuurn
[10:56:53] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Not sure what the state of affairs is with GNU ports to OSX.
[10:57:14] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: That is, whether any of the real terminal emulators have been ported to OSX native.
[10:57:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: csstransfomr3d is not the cause i just tested to be sure
[10:58:04] <johnbender> arschmitz: alright
[10:58:06] <arschmitz> johnbender: of the nav issue
[10:58:08] <johnbender> yah
[10:58:16] <johnbender> I think it's just a timing issue with hashchange, per _|Nix|_ 
[10:58:25] <johnbender> should be able to sort it out
[10:58:32] <johnbender> might have to add setTimeout :(
[10:58:39] <johnbender> Wilto: do we still support ios3
[10:58:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah i saw your conversation there just figured id test the simple case to be sure
[10:58:56] <johnbender> follow up, do we still (want to)? support ios4
[10:59:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: thanks
[10:59:43] <Wilto> “[Process was terminated by signal 6]”
[10:59:47] <Wilto> …huh
[10:59:48] <uGoMobi> johnbender: iOS3 or 4?
[11:00:19] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Sounds like the app you're running is dying. Your terminal is fine, but the app you're running inside it is unstable.
[11:00:30] <Wilto> johnbender: I’m not sure whether we officially support iOS 3.x, but if so: I think it’s fair to say we don’t have to anymore.
[11:00:41] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: What command are you typing in to cause that. Does it print that out without you typing anything?
[11:00:42] <arschmitz> ios4 was at 9% of ios installs in october
[11:00:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ios4 had the bug that prevents us from using pushState
[11:00:56] <johnbender> damn that's a lot
[11:00:57] <uGoMobi> johnbender: iOS3 is C-grade if used with core 1.8.x
[11:01:04] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: I am just opening iTerm2 or Terminal.app—not running anything specific.
[11:01:07] <johnbender> alright
[11:01:09] <Wilto> Can’t even get to a prompt.
[11:01:10] <johnbender> I'll work around it
[11:01:11] <arschmitz> johnbender: ios3 is under 1% now so i think safe to drop
[11:01:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah that doesn't help me unfortunately :(
[11:01:23] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Then it is indeed your terminal that's h0rked. Weird.
[11:01:43] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: terminal.app at least should work. I mean it's officially supported by Apple.
[11:02:16] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: ... and the bad news is I haven't really found a good native emulator. They talk about iTerm2, but I'm sure that's what you've got.
[11:02:31] <Wilto> Yep. Also on fire.
[11:03:17] <gseguin> meeting?
[11:03:18] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: You could always install X11 and xterm. I think Apple ships an X server.
[11:03:24] <johnbender> Wilto: _|Nix|_ uGoMobi gseguin yes lets get started 
[11:03:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: ^
[11:03:26] <Wilto> Meeting.
[11:03:36] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:03:42] <arschmitz> sounds good
[11:40:23] <Wilto> Okay, WeeChat is awesome.
[11:41:18] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: ... but unlike IRCcloud, you can't stay in the channel across devices.
[11:41:27] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: ... or is that one web-based too?
[11:42:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: just need to use an ircproxy for that
[11:42:17] <Wilto> is that cloud tho
[11:42:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: Wilto: we have one setup for jquery team members
[11:42:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Or a shell account.
[11:42:32] <johnbender> gnarf: irc proxy 
[11:42:44] <johnbender> we have one right?
[11:42:46] <Wilto> Yeah, gotta look up that info.
[11:43:03] <johnbender> I thought I saw jquery.com in dave methods disconnect info
[11:43:14] <johnbender> s/dave methods/Dave Methvin's
[11:43:18] <johnbender> lolol

[11:44:49] <_|Nix|_> Ooops ... that should've been docs/demos/_assets/5
[11:45:02] <_|Nix|_> js/jquery.mobile.demos.js in my commit message
[11:48:11] <arschmitz> johnbender: we have znc
[11:48:43] <arschmitz> johnbender: thats what im on to stay connected on all devices 
[11:49:31] <arschmitz> Wilto: if you want znc just talk to gnarf
[11:50:34] <arschmitz> Wilto: also just so you know the failure in the csstransform3d test causes popups to not be able to open on ie8
[11:51:15] <arschmitz> Wilto: panels not popups sorry
[11:52:05] <Wilto> gnarf: I would like one ZNC, please.
[11:52:24] <Wilto> arschmitz: Ah, definitely related, then. Cool.
[11:53:24] <arschmitz> Wilto: its because panel open depends on the transition completing and on ie8 of course it never will 
[11:53:37] <Wilto> Yeah, that’s what I figured.
[11:53:56] <arschmitz> Wilto: want to know a really weird twist though
[11:55:24] <arschmitz> Wilto: on ie 8 this will fail
[11:55:26] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/osiwuw/14/edit
[11:56:07] <arschmitz> but if you go to the docs and run $.support.ccssTrasform3D() it will return true!
[11:56:24] <jlembeck> that's... bizarre
[11:56:25] <arschmitz> cxecpt typed correctly even
[11:56:41] <arschmitz> and on panel it of course fails
[11:56:55] <arschmitz> test fails = returns true
[11:57:30] <arschmitz> jlembeck: yeah its really really strange
[11:58:11] <arschmitz> but everything runs perfectly if we dont test for the un-prefixed perspective
[12:00:06] <Wilto> man what
[12:00:15] <arschmitz> Wilto: lol right
[12:04:24] <Wilto> Iiiinteresting.
[12:05:59] <arschmitz> Wilto: Yup i dont know maybe its jsbin being weird or something?
[12:08:21] <arschmitz> Wilto: the easy lazy fix is to say if $.mobile.support.oldIE return false
[12:08:38] <arschmitz> $.mobile.browser.oldIE that is
[12:09:10] <Wilto> Yeah. Kinda wanna keep that as a “last resort.”
[12:09:29] <arschmitz> Wilto: yeah i wasent recomending it by any means lol
[12:18:37] <gseguin> johnbender, Wilto: znc.jquery.com
[12:19:08] <johnbender> gseguin: I thought thye had to set you up with an account
[12:19:37] * johnbender is headed to the gym
[12:25:15] <gseguin> johnbender: yep I think they do
[12:25:56] <gseguin> Wilto, johnbender: ryanneufeld can help you too
[12:26:14] <ryanneufeld> I can do what now?
[12:26:18] <Wilto> Ah-hah.
[12:26:22] <Wilto> ryanneufeld: FIX IT
[12:26:45] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: you want a znc account?
[12:27:01] <Wilto> ryanneufeld: I do,
[12:27:11] <ryanneufeld> I can provide this to you, at a low low, one time cost of a few minutes of your time.
[12:27:26] <Wilto> ryanneufeld: Time is the one thing we DON’T HAVE.
[12:27:45] <Wilto> actually no yeah I got ten minutes hook it up
[12:27:48] <jlembeck> I would also like a znc account
[12:28:00] <jlembeck> and also might have ten to eleven minutes
[12:28:02] <jlembeck> no more, no less.
[12:28:11] <Wilto> “Eleven?” Overachiever.
[12:28:37] <Wilto> …no spell check in WeeChat, huh?
[12:28:45] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: you already have an account
[12:29:06] <Wilto> oh
[12:29:08] <ryanneufeld> jlembeck: you're on the jqm team right?
[12:29:13] <jlembeck> yessir
[12:29:17] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: I can reset your password
[12:29:21] <ryanneufeld> jlembeck: coming right up
[12:29:27] <Wilto> ryanneufeld: What uh… what would I, in theory, do with such a login.
[12:29:45] <JoeSlack> ASCII porn
[12:29:50] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: you woudl configure your IRC client to connect to the znc instance
[12:29:50] <Wilto> ryanneufeld: Don’t say “yell it super loud into a USB port,” because I tried that first.
[12:30:05] <ryanneufeld> instead of freenode
[12:30:28] <ryanneufeld> and then you would always be logged in
[12:30:38] <ryanneufeld> and would get a buffer playback when you rejoin
[12:30:49] <Wilto> Huh.
[12:30:50] <Wilto> Okay yeah.
[12:31:07] <jlembeck> I like that, a lot.
[12:31:26] <Wilto> I mean, I know how to do all that, but like… jlembeck probably doesn’t, so, maybe just uh be around in case I have any questions for you. From him. Not me.
[12:32:42] <Wilto> Ah-hah: http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC
[12:34:19] <gseguin> thanks for the weechat pointer Wilto!
[12:34:37] <Wilto> Pretty sweet, right gseguin?
[12:34:38] <gseguin> I'm sure you can make irssi look exactly like that but weechat is nice, out of the box
[12:34:50] <gseguin> yeah, love it!
[12:35:11] <Wilto> Try `/window splith 50`
[12:35:57] <gseguin> OMG! I can have 2 channels in the same terminal at the same time!? 
[12:36:04] <gseguin> My brain is going to explode!
[12:36:11] <Wilto> Alt + left/right swaps between windows in each… split or whatever, and `/window up` `/window down` jumps between them.
[12:39:52] <gseguin> Wilto: why do you use a terminal irc client?
[12:39:59] <gseguin> are you not using a Mac?
[12:40:24] <Wilto> Eh, the GUIs all seem really clunky. I didn’t mind IRCCloud, but it’s so shaky latley.
[12:40:27] <Wilto> …lately.
[12:40:57] <gseguin> I use Linkinus on my Mac, it's nice
[12:54:34] <_|Nix|_> OK, so I wanna measure the time between a click and a pageshow: ( function( $, undefined ) { var startTime; $( document ).bind( "click", function() { startTime = new Date(); } ).bind( "pageshow", function() { if ( startTime ) { console.log( ( new Date() ).getTime() - startTime.getTime() ); } startTime = undefined; } ); } )( jQuery );
[12:54:56] <_|Nix|_> How come startTime is undefined in "pageshow" when I set it in "click".
[12:54:59] <_|Nix|_> ?
[12:55:10] <_|Nix|_> Is it some kind of JS scoping thing?
[12:55:31] * _|Nix|_ is still very much a JS n00b ...
[12:59:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that works for me when i run it in the console
[12:59:10] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! Are the demos getting reloaded or something.
[12:59:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://gist.github.com/
[12:59:38] <jlembeck-> yeah, works for me as well
[12:59:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Got a gist ID?
[12:59:39] <arschmitz> i past that into the console and navigate and i get the times logged
[12:59:47] <arschmitz> oops lol
[13:00:03] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: FYI, you're the heaviest user of ZNC
[13:00:10] <ryanneufeld> accumulating a 3GB usage
[13:00:11] <arschmitz>  really???
[13:00:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: K, weird, because I added that to the top of docs/demos/_assets/js/jqm-demos.js and I get undefined.
[13:00:31] <arschmitz> im only on 3 channels?
[13:00:41] <arschmitz> i take that back 4
[13:00:53] <ryanneufeld> sorry, you're at 2.3GB
[13:00:59] <ryanneufeld> the next closest is me
[13:01:03] <ryanneufeld> at 195
[13:01:05] <ryanneufeld> MB
[13:01:12] <arschmitz> holy cow any idea why?
[13:01:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are you asking me?
[13:01:34] <arschmitz> no ryanneufeld
[13:01:34] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: it's not a problem
[13:01:41] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: you just talk a lot
[13:01:49] <ryanneufeld> lol
[13:01:50] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: lol ok
[13:02:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://gist.github.com/4447242
[13:02:08] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Do you have to be using ZNC to get that stat?
[13:02:22] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: I only have access to those stats on ZNC
[13:02:29] <ryanneufeld> so, in this case, yes
[13:02:46] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: could it be because i log on from 5 different devices?
[13:02:55] <ryanneufeld> arschmitz: oh, yeah, that'll do it
[13:03:01] <gseguin> uGoMobi: still there?
[13:03:31] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: yeah iphone ipad desktop and 2 laptops :|
[13:03:34] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes
[13:03:55] <gseguin> uGoMobi: so debouncing is not going to solve the issue
[13:04:30] <gseguin> I think we need to keep track of the content the last time the handler was invoked
[13:04:54] <gseguin> and for onChange don't do anything if the content has not change
[13:05:07] <gseguin> does that make sense?
[13:05:47] <uGoMobi> gseguin: one sec I take a look at the code
[13:05:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: i think thats the only option to maintain crossbrowser compat and still support paste

[13:08:39] <_|Nix|_> OK. This is insane ... I even tried window.startTime, and it's still undefined by the time it gets to pageshow ...
[13:08:43] <_|Nix|_> WTF?!
[13:09:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: wierd like i said works in the console
[13:09:06] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: time for a Chrome restart?
[13:09:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Maybe.
[13:10:07] <uGoMobi> gseguin: it makes sense but I wonder what that means for performance
[13:10:08] <Wilto> Try unplugging the console then plugging it back in again.
[13:10:12] <Wilto> Works with my router.
[13:10:48] <uGoMobi> gseguin: there are already complains about poor performance of the filter
[13:10:53] <_|Nix|_> OK ... now it's not firing pageshow ...
[13:11:24] <gseguin> uGoMobi: if anything it should be faster since we'll be doing less
[13:13:25] * _|Nix|_ facepalms ... Links off the demo index page are non-AJAX!
[13:13:27] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ah ok.. was only thinking about the check we will do every time change fires
[13:13:37] <_|Nix|_> Of course the variables get reset ...
[13:13:57] <uGoMobi> gseguin: but now we filter every time that event fires so that can be reduced
[13:14:17] <uGoMobi> (getting late here)
[13:16:04] <uGoMobi> gseguin: sounds like good solution to me
[13:16:24] <gseguin> ok, I'll whip up something and submit a PR
[13:20:32] <uGoMobi> cool
[13:28:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if you want to use source view outside the demos remember that you have to include the CSS too
[13:29:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I added it to jqm-demos.css but that is customized for our docs/demos/
[13:29:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[13:29:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Might have to split that out too ...
[13:29:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[13:29:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Luckily CSS has a convenient @include directive.
[13:30:14] <uGoMobi> @import you mean
[13:30:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Goes to show you how much I know about CSS.
[13:30:34] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:31:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but you are right, no need for PHP scripts there
[13:35:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Man! Adding View Source to the form reference demo increases load time by 600ms on Chrome/Linux.
[13:35:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: From 1.1s to 1.7s ...
[13:35:48] <uGoMobi> yeah those are heavy pages
[13:35:50] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: nope I'm good, Wilto might need one
[13:35:57] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I use my friend's service IRCRelay
[13:36:10] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: welcome back
[13:36:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm still thinking about making it even lazier - that is, no popups are created during load.
[13:36:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: They're created when you click the "View Source" button.
[13:36:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sounds good
[13:37:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but I'd like to make it work with the nav, like popup does. So, no click handler or anything.
[13:37:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have the beginnings of an idea.
[13:37:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we also have to see what we do with the issue I mentioned this afternoon
[13:37:57] <uGoMobi> that is... if you refresh a demo the source view shows enhanced markup
[13:38:06] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: thanks :)
[13:42:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Woah, really? Weird!
[13:42:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's tackle that first.
[13:42:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nah not weird actually
[13:43:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, you're right, but we need to reset the state.
[13:43:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... somewhere.
[13:43:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the source view button is gone again on latest
[13:43:55] <uGoMobi> :/
[13:44:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What?!
[13:44:18] <johnbender> gseguin: uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5410#issuecomment-11862226
[13:44:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It was there a second ago ...
[13:44:24] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/swipe/swipe-list.html
[13:45:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not finding jquery.mobile.demos.js ...
[13:46:00] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I like that idea
[13:46:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Is jquerymobile.com/test built on any of the buildbots I can see?
[13:46:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Like, swarm.jquery.org:8080 ...
[13:46:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: no, you can build it locally though
[13:46:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the problem is <script src="../_assets/js/jquery.mobile.demos.js"></script>
[13:46:57] <johnbender> let me check 
[13:47:19] <_|Nix|_> u
[13:47:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sorry you already said that
[13:47:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: make build_latest
[13:47:56] <uGoMobi> IRCCloud :(
[13:47:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I did build it locally and it's fine, whereas on jquerymobile.com/test the file compiled/demos/docs/demos/assets/_js/jquery.mobile.demos.js is absent.
[13:48:07] <johnbender> sigh
[13:48:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So I wouldn't mind checking the output from grunt.
[13:49:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah the output doesn't show muc
[13:49:21] <johnbender> *much
[13:49:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I've reproduced it.
[13:49:30] <uGoMobi> maybe they should rename IRCCloud to IRCDelay... pff
[13:49:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Probably a task dependency missing.
[13:49:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Does build_latest depend on docs?
[13:50:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I guess it must since it builds jquerymobile.com/test ...
[13:51:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I guess build_latest doesn't run grunt docs. Weird though, because the file was being created on jquerymobile.com/test until a few commits ago.
[13:52:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it depends on the makefile task "docs" which doesn't appear to run grunt docs
[13:52:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: from where does the grunt docs come from?
[13:52:37] <johnbender> it's not in our custom tasks
[13:52:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that was deliberate because the file manipulations would have been insanely difficult with grunt/js
[13:53:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: grunt docs ends up running a bash script: grunt.registerTask('docs', 'js css legacy_tasks:docs concat:demosjs');
[13:53:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: legacy_tasks:docs ends up running build/bin/docs.sh
[13:54:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah, and it runs the bash script
[13:54:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yep.
[13:54:19] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nothing beats sed.
[13:54:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: fact
[13:54:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Still, that needs to be chained in somewhere, it seems - although I have seen this work, like, an hour ago.
[13:55:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Weird that it broke.
[13:55:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: do you want to keep working on it?
[13:55:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I would.
[13:55:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I need to know which make target ends up populating jquerymobile.com/test - is it build_latest?
[13:56:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If it is, then that's why it's not working.
[13:56:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: deploy_latest
[13:56:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Aha, OK.
[13:56:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: sorry, I'm not being very helpful at all :/
[13:57:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: No, that's great. However, deploy_latest seems to expect compiled/ to be present, and fails when it's the first target I run. Maybe it needs to depend on build_latest.
[13:57:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: see `latest` target
[13:58:05] <johnbender> backward compat in the lamest way possible
[13:58:21] <johnbender> latest should just be an alias for deploy_latest which depends on build_latest
[13:58:24] <johnbender> my bad
[13:59:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Woah ... these targets expect the directory /var/www/html/code.jquery.com/mobile/latest to be present ...
[13:59:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can do *shrug*
[14:01:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: lol :)
[14:01:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: better to have an absolute path that fails than a relative path that works in the wrong case 
[14:02:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: :)
[14:02:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Maybe this act of replacing js/ with js/jquery.mobile.js is happening in more places than just build/bin/docs.sh ...
[14:03:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it might be
[14:03:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the build is a tangle
[14:03:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: should be able to grep for sed calls
[14:03:33] <johnbender> in the build/
[14:03:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Did you just tell me to grep for sed?
[14:03:52] * _|Nix|_ shakes his head laughing
[14:04:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We have to go deeper!
[14:11:37] <uGoMobi> I am off... good night all!
[14:11:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: L8$
[14:11:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: L8R, I mean.
[14:23:57] <wilto> Alright. Think I got a solid 3D test, but we are gonna have to test the hell out of said test.

[14:31:28] <arschmitz> testing now
[14:31:30] <wilto> But we need to test the bajeezus out of it.

[14:32:40] <wilto> motherfokay
[14:32:50] <wilto> Wait, yeah? Something’s up; hang on.
[14:33:13] <arschmitz> ok
[14:39:38] <_|Nix|_> I wonder what uGoMobi meant when he said that the demos' view source buttons display enhanced markup after refreshing.
[14:39:45] <_|Nix|_> I can't repro that.
[14:40:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it was something about going to a page then away then back i think
[14:41:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... lessee ...
[14:41:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i havent seen or tried to see it thats just when i remember him saying
[14:42:03] <arschmitz> i could be wrong though
[14:42:08] <_|Nix|_> are
[14:42:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I can't seem to repro it that way either.
[14:42:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, click on a demo, go back, click on the same demo.
[14:42:43] <arschmitz> not sure probably best to just wait for uGoMobi
[14:42:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll just have to wait for the morning to ask him.
[14:42:50] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[14:45:50] <_|Nix|_> OK. Reprod.
[14:45:58] <_|Nix|_> I just needed to scroll back.
[14:46:12] <_|Nix|_> ... but I think I'll tackle it tomorrow.
[14:46:14] <_|Nix|_> L8R all.

[14:59:19] <arschmitz> wilto: im heading home but ill check it out in a little while if you get it fixed
[15:50:00] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ in opera it looks like no popstate fires when the replacestate is to the same url
[15:50:01] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[15:50:29] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ I need to figure out why it's replacing the same url but if for whatever reason that's sane, I've got a fix
[15:50:29] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[16:05:56] <RWhitbeck> Hey guys what's the difference between the jquery.mobile.css and jquery.mobile.structure.css?
[16:07:15] <RWhitbeck> from jquery mobile stable on this page http://code.jquery.com/
[16:10:51] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: structure is required for themeing
[16:11:06] <johnbender> jquery.mobile.css includes a default theme
[16:11:37] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: that is, if you wanted to create your own theme with the theme roller you wouldn't use jquery.mobile.css you would use the structure file and your generated theme
[16:11:46] <johnbender> saves wire weight
[16:12:15] <RWhitbeck> that's why I've never ran into it is because themeroller is giving me structure when I build something custom. 
[16:15:44] <RWhitbeck> thanks johnbender for the explaination
[16:16:11] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: yessir
[16:16:21] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: it's been a while but I'm 99% sure on all of that
