[00:22:15] <uGoMobi> good morning
[00:23:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5094
[00:24:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when I test http://jsbin.com/uzaret/20 on Ubuntu 12.4 / Chrome and Win 7 / Chrome I do see the slideup transition and the issue
[00:26:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will try to find the cause

[04:49:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Thanks!
[06:55:42] <toddmparker_> morning
[06:56:08] <toddmparker_> any idea what that failure is about?
[06:57:47] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker_
[06:57:53] <toddmparker_> hey uGoMobi
[06:58:10] <uGoMobi> looks like failure has to do with new tests
[06:58:59] <toddmparker_> the nav ones from _|Nix|_ or johnbender?
[06:59:02] <uGoMobi> nav sequence tests
[07:07:23] <toddmparker_> gotcha, dont' think _|Nix|_ is here ATM

[08:23:06] <maxlynch> toddmparker_: I'm going to be updating the codiqa embed for 1.2.0, but I'm hitting that iframe snapping bug again, but in a different form this time :)
[11:31:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I'm seeing some really weird timeouts with QUnit. I'm trying to figure them out.
[11:31:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I'm doing a bisect to see where the timeout started happening.
[11:32:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: It's weird, because I always run the unit tests before pushing anything, and I didn't see the timeout. Now,  when I run the unit tests for the same commit, I do see the timeout.
[11:32:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ... and I see the timeout for the current jQuery, not the old one or the git one.
[11:42:09] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: that is odd
[15:01:11] <toddmparker_> heading home, goodnight all
