[08:20:43] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:33:06] <toddparker> morning everyone
[08:33:17] <toddparker> thanks again for all your help. beta 1 feels really solid
[08:34:07] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[08:34:13] <gseguin> yes sir?
[08:34:15] <toddparker> wanna work on something fun?
[08:34:16] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1877
[08:34:19] <toddparker> new design
[08:34:44] <gseguin> sure!
[08:34:48] <toddparker> cool
[08:34:54] <toddparker> i think you'll need a mockup
[08:35:09] <toddparker> my notes are confusing
[08:35:26] * gseguin is reading the notes
[08:37:04] <gseguin> toddparker: so you want the square of the checkbox or the round of the radio to highlight on hover instead of the entire row, right?
[08:39:38] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: gseguin: Just an FYI, I'm going to be tied up the first half of today doing some code reviews for some stuff I'm working on internally
[08:39:53] <kinblas> If I'm not resonsive, that's why, I'll check-in 'round lunch time PST
[08:41:23] <gseguin> kinblas, toddparker: I'll be in sprint planning meeting from 2pm to 5pm PST
[08:58:50] <toddparker> thinking radios and checks could have a more subtle on state
[08:58:58] <toddparker> i just emailed your a mockup
[08:59:20] <toddparker> so instead of toggling ont eh button, you just flip the bg image behind the icon with the active state
[08:59:40] <toddparker> gseguin - no problem
[08:59:52] <toddparker> good we moved our meeting to thursdays
[09:00:04] <toddparker> ok kinblas
[09:01:53] <gseguin> toddparker: oh so that is just for the active state, not the hover state
[09:02:17] * gseguin is realizing that hover doesn't mean much on touch platforms
[09:30:10] <gseguin> toddparker: why is the background of the checkbox part of the image?
[09:30:47] <gseguin> is that a workaround for a platform not supporting CSS rounded corners?
[10:48:10] <eddiemonge> this is so ulgly looking and not at all easily memorable: $.mobile.page.prototype.options.addBackBtn = true
[10:49:24] <gseguin> eddiemonge: I know! It'd be great to have a $.mobile.setOption util method
[10:49:53] <eddiemonge> open a ticket for it. maybe someone will have time to do that. i might even if i find some time
[10:53:35] <gseguin> eddiemonge: created https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1880
[11:04:54] <toddparker> gseguin - seems like a good idea, we'll have to see what kinblas and scottjehl think
[11:09:02] <gseguin> toddparker: yep comments are very welcome
[11:09:23] <gseguin> toddparker: why is the background of the checkbox part of the image?
[11:09:33] <gseguin> is that a workaround for a platform not supporting CSS rounded corners?
[11:11:12] <toddparker> you mean the semi-transparent gray in the image sprite?
[11:11:20] <gseguin> yeah
[11:11:43] <toddparker> that is there so we can drop the image on top of any gradient and get the darker, indented look
[11:12:03] <toddparker> we probably could have done it another way
[11:12:33] <gseguin> ok just wondering
[11:12:54] <toddparker> you'd need a container with a bg gradient that uses rgba so you could go from 8% black to 4% lack or whatever
[11:13:00] <toddparker> got sort of complex
[11:13:23] <gseguin> ok
[11:13:59] <toddparker> but we can use border-radius on the container with the active state to make the circle or rounded square
[11:14:10] <toddparker> then have the bg image on top of that
[11:14:18] <gseguin> right that's exactly where I was going
[11:14:20] <toddparker> you might need an additional container to make this work
[11:14:22] <toddparker> cool
[11:14:28] <toddparker> can't wait to see it
[11:14:55] <gseguin> alright, I'll try to share that today
[11:15:11] <gseguin> what's the preferred way to go?
[11:15:19] <gseguin> do I create a branch on my fork
[11:15:25] <gseguin> or a branch on the main repo?
[11:15:56] <gseguin> toddparker: ^^^
[11:30:19] <kinblas> toddparker: ping
[12:13:02] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[12:13:14] <toddparker> just saw that pull
[12:13:22] <gseguin> try it out
[12:13:38] <gseguin> let me know
[12:14:19] <toddparker> cool
[12:14:23] <toddparker> hey kinblas!
[12:17:42] <toddparker> gseguin - that looks nice
[12:17:47] <toddparker> what do you think?
[12:17:58] <toddparker> open to other ideas
[12:21:35] <toddparker> i do like it, feels cleaner
[12:25:45] <kinblas> toddparker: I was just going to say that I couldn't repro that dialog goes back 2 levels in history on desktop
[12:25:52] <kinblas> it's a touch only thang
[12:26:17] <kinblas> the same types of bugs we were trying to fix between a4 and a4.1
[12:28:10] <miketaylr> sup dudes
[12:45:35] <toddparker> hey miketaylr
[12:45:41] <miketaylr> hiya
[12:46:17] <toddparker> you volunteering to help us sort of all the vendor prefixed rules for beta 2?
[12:46:20] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1883
[12:46:25] <miketaylr> haha looks like it :)
[12:46:31] <toddparker> SOLD!
[12:46:40] <miketaylr> i'm digging into that right now, trying to come up with a good solution
[12:46:47] <toddparker> that's great
[12:46:58] <miketaylr> or i could just tweet "#fail"--that seems easier
[12:47:09] <toddparker> heh
[12:47:17] <toddparker> it's what everyone does
[12:47:22] <miketaylr> ha, i know
[12:47:34] <toddparker> jQM #fail. transitions are broke in Firefox mobile beta
[12:47:36] <toddparker> BOO
[12:47:42] <toddparker> we're all for polishing up the CSS for all these platforms
[12:47:47] <miketaylr> sweet
[12:48:00] <toddparker> we just need to be careful about bloat
[12:48:22] <toddparker> all the prefixing adds to much
[12:48:34] <miketaylr> yeah, it can get nasty
[12:48:36] <toddparker> but we just may need to suck it up
[12:48:43] <toddparker> it's more than transitions too
[12:49:06] <toddparker> css gradients on IE require two different filter syntaxes for IE 7 and (Mango)
[12:49:16] <miketaylr> andreas bovens (my boss) asked me to dig into jq mobile so hopefully i can help out a little bit
[12:49:16] <toddparker> and some hackery to make 'em actually render
[12:49:24] <toddparker> that would be super cool
[12:49:36] <miketaylr> i should probably like, build something before i complain
[12:49:39] <toddparker> we mentioned that we want to focus on this for the next beta so good timing
[12:49:42] <toddparker> heh
[12:50:02] <miketaylr> so yeah, i'll comment on 1883 then get started today/tomorrow with a hello world app
[12:50:23] <toddparker> step 1 is to identify what properties we need to add vendor prefixed (or std) versions
[12:50:36] <toddparker> and generally where they ar eused
[12:50:58] <toddparker> then someone (aham( coudl start workin it out
[12:50:58] <miketaylr> cool
[12:51:21] <toddparker> that other ticket #18 i linked to discussed this more broadly, but it's old
[12:55:09] <miketaylr> aha, i refreshed
[12:56:10] <toddparker> GitHub is all Ajax-y to be cool and slow
[12:56:24] <toddparker> but not to, ya know update the view quickly for new comments
[12:58:56] <toddparker> thanks for jumping in miketaylr
[12:58:59] <gseguin> toddparker: I like it too
[12:59:04] <miketaylr> no problemo
[12:59:16] <toddparker> gseguin - the new radiobutton/checkbox style?
[12:59:20] <gseguin> yes
[12:59:31] <toddparker> yeah, i prefer it
[12:59:36] <toddparker> old style is too much
[12:59:55] <gseguin> only question is, is there any mobile browser that has problems with rounded corners?
[13:00:15] <toddparker> oh sure - android, WP7
[13:00:33] <toddparker> android is just crap looking (not anti-aliased) but it is rounded
[13:00:37] <gseguin> alright le me try it out on android
[13:00:38] <toddparker> like nintendo
[13:01:20] <gseguin> oh ok, but it's working, just not very smooth
[13:02:04] <toddparker> yeah
[13:02:16] <toddparker> i'm going to upload ot my server so i can test more easily
[13:02:25] <gseguin> alright
[13:02:40] <gseguin> I don't have WP7 so I can't test on that
[13:04:24] <toddparker> k
[13:09:26] <toddparker> Check/radio demo page: http://bit.ly/jkThLJ
[13:10:50] <toddparker> looks good on WebOS
[13:11:33] <gseguin> testing on Android 2.3 and 3.0
[13:13:03] <gseguin> the radio is 1px to the right on android 2.3
[13:13:05] <gseguin> :(
[13:13:38] <toddparker> looks good in android 2.1
[13:13:54] <toddparker> i don't have 2.3 and 3 - do you have devices or just emulators?
[13:14:07] <gseguin> devices
[13:14:13] <toddparker> oh nice
[13:14:24] <gseguin> looks good on 3.0
[13:14:24] <toddparker> waiting for a non-phone running 2.3 = cheaper
[13:15:03] <gseguin> yeah we have phones with 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3
[13:15:13] <gseguin> and a Xoom with 3.0
[13:16:01] <toddparker> cool
[13:16:03] <toddparker> nice
[13:16:12] <toddparker> so 2.3 is the only buggy one?
[13:16:18] <gseguin> yep
[13:16:19] <toddparker> so it' snot lining up?
[13:16:41] <gseguin> yeah the white dot of the radio is 1px off to the right
[13:17:13] <gseguin> if you look at the changeset I changed the background-position by 1px
[13:17:29] <gseguin> I'll play a little with it
[13:17:55] <gseguin> we don't have platform specific CSS class anyway, do we?
[13:18:36] <toddparker> nope
[13:18:51] <toddparker> hoping you can finesse
[13:19:51] <gseguin> let's see what I can do
[15:29:24] <gseguin> toddparker: no luck on the android 2.3 so far
[15:30:46] <gseguin> UA specific classes on the body would be the way here I think
