[00:00:50] <Dragooon> Is the theme roller compatible with current git head?
[00:01:00] <gseguin> ?tell Wilto: the generic metadata is in
[00:01:00] <bot-t1> gseguin, Okay.
[00:02:14] <Dragooon> gseguin: ^
[00:02:47] <gseguin> That's a question for tbenzige
[00:03:01] <Dragooon> Any idea when he's around?
[00:03:27] <gseguin> more like business hours PST
[00:03:51] <Dragooon> Okay, thanks
[00:04:28] <gseguin> I think it should be compatible I don't know of any huge changes on the CSS side
[00:06:07] <Dragooon> Does theme roller have a git repository/
[00:06:09] <Dragooon> ?
[00:06:26] <gseguin> it does
[00:06:38] <gseguin> let me find it for you (if I can)
[00:07:18] <gseguin> Dragooon: https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller
[00:07:25] <Dragooon> Thanks
[00:07:30] <gseguin> np
[00:08:18] <Dragooon> Yeah, doesn't seem to have any major changes since it's release and the output CSS seems to be mostly same
[00:09:00] <gseguin> yeah big changes in CSS are mostly the transitions (in master)
[00:09:00] <Dragooon> Yay!
[00:09:24] <Dragooon> Yeah, luckily that's in a separate file. :D
[01:26:12] <Dragooon> Something's wrong with make file
[01:26:29] <Dragooon> It's compiling the animations CSS into normal CSS file instead of the structure file
[07:20:38] <Dragooon> If I changePage to a page element, it should work fine right?
[13:02:05] <gseguin> Hey Wilto, did bot-t deliver my message?
[13:02:24] <Wilto> Yessir—awesome stuff, man.
[13:02:46] <gseguin> cool
[13:09:17] <gseguin> how come I don't see bot-t message in IRCCloud's log? bot-t are you slacking? or did IRCCloud get the hiccup?
[13:10:19] <gseguin> oh I see bot-t1 went ni-night, it's his buddy who's here now
[13:11:19] <gseguin> danheberden: ping
[13:15:54] <danheberden> gseguin yo
[13:20:34] <gseguin> hey do we have a server with nodejs running somewhere
[13:21:08] <gseguin> that could host the node service for our (jqm) bundle builder
[13:21:15] <gseguin> danheberden: ^
[13:21:44] <danheberden> well i think jqui was doing something using nojitsu
[13:22:07] <gseguin> so right now it's hosted at no.de
[13:23:08] <gseguin> it works well, but I was told that we would rather host it on our machines
[13:23:18] <danheberden> by who?
[13:23:31] <gseguin> toddmparker_
[13:24:05] <danheberden> is it just jqm peeps building it?
[13:24:28] <Wilto> Nah, gonna be a public dealie.
[13:24:42] <Wilto> You thinking it’ll be too much to host?
[13:24:45] <danheberden> ah, ok - i guess i'm confused that if jqui is building a builder
[13:24:45] <gseguin> no it's going to be a backend service for a public bundle builder
[13:24:54] <danheberden> and jqm is building a builder
[13:24:56] <Wilto> Oh, we buildin’ a builder.
[13:25:02] <danheberden> like, it feels like two disparate paths
[13:25:17] <Wilto> I may even make a builder builder _builder_, to build the builder that builds the jQM builder.
[13:25:23] <danheberden> haha
[13:25:31] <gseguin> :)
[13:25:42] <danheberden> so as for resources, if you need something to play on, we can throw it on the services box - the one that runs the irc logs
[13:25:53] <danheberden> as for actual server it could live on
[13:26:07] <Wilto> Yeah, we’ve got it pretty much done using no.de.
[13:26:10] <danheberden> chris lea at (mt) is getting our new servers setup, so we'll have a couple free machines soon
[13:26:17] <gseguin> for sandbox I already have amd-builder.no.de
[13:26:25] <Wilto> Just figuring out where it’ll live.
[13:26:26] <danheberden> ok, so most of the server stuff is waiting on (mt) at the moment
[13:26:41] <danheberden> so until i get my hands on those boxes, any work now is kinda a waste
[13:27:02] <danheberden> but he's going at it with both barrels, so i anticiate soon
[13:27:02] <gseguin> ok
[13:27:05] <danheberden> *anticipate
[13:27:07] <Wilto> Sweet.
[13:27:16] <danheberden> but getting it won't be a big deal - whateva y'all need
[13:27:19] <gseguin> cool
[13:27:23] <danheberden> as for coordination, gnarf will be your man
[13:27:30] <danheberden> he's gonna be the guy making sure it's all set up sanely
[13:27:34] <gseguin> cool
[13:28:11] <gseguin> and it'll be running nodeJS ?
[13:28:30] <danheberden> so, i think for this instance you'll be on your own box with nodeJS
[13:28:41] <danheberden> since a bulk of the assets are wordpress
[13:28:54] <danheberden> those sites can live there, and we can have a box for node based services
[13:28:56] <danheberden> like the plugin site
[13:29:12] <gseguin> ok
[13:30:03] <gseguin> alright, well if you can let me know when all that comes together I'll sync up with gnarf at that point
[13:30:34] <danheberden> can you email me at danheberden@gmail.com so i can add you to the planning stuff?
[13:30:44] <gseguin> absolutely
[13:30:49] <danheberden> thnx
[13:31:17] <danheberden> although i should probably get wilto to plan this, so he can plan the plan that will plan the planning of the plan to plan the plan
[13:32:24] <Wilto> danheberden: http://wil.to/_/dawg.jpg
[13:32:43] <gseguin> that's right Wilto can you email me to remind me to email danheberden ? or should I email you to do so?
[13:33:09] <Wilto> Maybe http://bukk.it/inception.jpg, actually.
[13:34:54] <gseguin> thanks danheberden
[13:35:41] <Wilto> Yeah—thanks, broham.
[13:36:15] <danheberden> mad luv to my jqm homies
[13:36:18] <danheberden> *bromies
[13:43:32] <Wilto> jQuery Broble.
