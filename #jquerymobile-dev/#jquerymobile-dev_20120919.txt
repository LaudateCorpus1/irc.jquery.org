[02:09:59] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #64: FIXED in 8 min 29 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/64/
[06:59:45] <toddmparker_> Good morning
[07:00:04] <toddmparker_> Loving the new triage tag team of uGoMobi and MauriceG
[07:00:20] <toddmparker_> Addressing them as they come in is the way to go
[07:00:27] <toddmparker_> Amazing work, keep it up
[07:01:08] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker_
[07:05:10] <toddmparker_> hey uGoMobi
[07:21:07] <toddmparker_> re: 1.1.2, yes we'll do that
[07:21:36] <toddmparker_> just happened we didn't do multiple maintenance releases for 1.0 becase 1.1 was so much better
[07:21:45] <toddmparker_> wanted to force people to upgrade
[07:21:57] <toddmparker_> 1.1 is solid so we should maintain it longer
[07:34:22] <gseguin> mornin' all
[07:34:34] <gseguin> looks like the builder server is down
[07:34:40] <gseguin> gnarf: ^
[07:35:09] <gseguin> I tried to add 1.2.0-rc.1 to it this morning, hope I didn't screw it up
[07:43:48] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[07:49:53] <gseguin> hey
[07:57:26] <gseguin> toddmparker_: do you know where jquerymobile.com lives?
[07:57:52] <gseguin> gnarf, johnbender: ^
[07:58:49] <gseguin> sorry I'm out of the loop but where is jquerymobile/amd-builder pointing to? jq02 or jq02.stage?
[08:36:57] <johnbender> gseguin: on the server
[08:37:07] <johnbender> gseguin: we have some extra stuff that lives next to it
[08:37:12] <johnbender> why?
[08:37:27] <gseguin> which server ?
[08:37:45] <gseguin> I'm trying to understand where does /amd-builder proxies to ?
[08:38:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi: seems like he sorted it out :/
[08:38:27] <johnbender> gseguin: I can take a look to see where it's living one sec
[08:43:04] <johnbender> gseguin: there is a note that it's jq02
[08:43:09] <johnbender> in the infra code
[08:43:52] <johnbender> gseguin: yah it's jq02
[08:44:06] <johnbender> gseguin: if you had vagrant setup you could build a local version of it instantly :)
[08:44:34] <gseguin> It's still on my list, getting closer to the top of it ;)
[08:44:52] <gseguin> alright so I don't understand what's going on
[08:45:05] <gseguin> if you go to jq02 and tail the syslog
[08:45:23] <gseguin> the you hit jquerymobile.com/download-builder
[08:45:33] <gseguin> and select latest
[08:45:47] <gseguin> there is no trace of it in the log
[08:48:52] <johnbender> gseguin: what about other releases
[08:49:04] <gseguin> same
[08:49:18] <gseguin> actually 1.2.0-rc.1 returns a 500
[08:49:39] <gseguin> but you'll see traces of 1.1.1 in the syslog
[08:50:22] <johnbender> gseguin:
[08:51:26] <gseguin> johnbender:
[08:51:32] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[08:51:42] <gseguin> are you speechless?
[08:51:54] <johnbender> gseguin: without knowing more about the application it's hard to know why it wouldn't be pushing to the syslog
[08:51:59] <johnbender> ie, how is the menu built
[08:52:10] <johnbender> are the options tied to existing pulls from the repo
[08:52:23] <johnbender> is it possible they aren't there
[08:52:33] <gseguin> my guess is that /amd-builder does not hit jq02 on port 3100
[08:52:37] <johnbender> why wouldn't it be logging anything, ie is it breaking before any of the logging statements?
[08:52:54] <johnbender> gseguin: can you hit jq02 directly?
[08:52:59] <johnbender> ah
[08:53:05] <johnbender> it's proxied by nginx
[08:53:17] <johnbender> but you said that there was activity
[08:53:23] <gseguin> yes
[08:53:25] <johnbender> you could check the nginx access logs on jq02 for that
[08:53:34] <gseguin> no idea where it's coming from though
[08:53:45] <gseguin> is it a health test?
[08:54:50] <johnbender> gseguin: do you have access to jq02?
[08:54:56] <gseguin> I do
[08:55:04] <johnbender> check the ng
[08:55:09] <johnbender> nginx logs then
[08:55:23] <johnbender> to see if its getting the traffic
[08:56:13] <gseguin> are you sure it's proxied by nginx ?
[08:56:33] <gseguin> there is only logs for the ui builder
[08:57:24] <johnbender> gseguin: how is it supposed to work from the top
[08:58:02] <gseguin> hold on, phone call...
[09:02:07] <gseguin> back
[09:02:36] <gseguin> alright so the builder page is a static page on jquerymobile.com
[09:03:03] <gseguin> it queries /amd-builder which proxies to the node service
[09:03:25] <gseguin> gets the dependency map
[09:03:31] <gseguin> and generates the ui
[09:03:45] <gseguin> johnbender: ^ does that make sense ?
[09:07:50] <johnbender> gseguin: yes
[09:07:56] <johnbender> gseguin: so can you go directly?
[09:08:15] <gseguin> problem is I don't know where jquerymobile.com lives
[09:08:17] <johnbender> make the request that the static page would otherwise make?
[09:08:22] <gseguin> so I can't check the proxy
[09:08:41] <gseguin> sure I can hit jq02 directly
[09:08:44] <johnbender> yes
[09:08:44] <gseguin> let's try that
[09:08:45] <johnbender> that
[09:08:49] <johnbender> that's what I'm asking
[09:16:27] <toddmparker_> just checking in on wehre we are with 1.2 - are there any blockers at this point?
[09:16:59] <toddmparker_> johnbender where did you and _|Nix|_ land with the scope of changes to popup's history. read thru the discussion but wasn't sure what the outcome was
[09:17:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll probably revisit it later but for now it works
[09:17:35] <johnbender> that is my change wouldn't be much smaller if at all
[09:17:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you around?
[09:18:05] <johnbender> I still had one more question
[09:18:07] <johnbender> small one
[09:19:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: also this scares me https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/6ef910d929edaa4c479eef61a814beb82b685c0f
[09:20:33] <gseguin> I have no clue what's going on with the builder
[09:22:26] <johnbender> gseguin: what was the result of hitting it directly
[09:22:38] <gseguin> same problem
[09:22:54] <gseguin> can't refresh the 1.2.0-rc.1 workspace
[09:23:22] <gseguin> ghislain.seguin@macjiver ~
[09:23:22] <gseguin> [10083]$ curl "http://jq02.jquery.com:3100/v1/jquery/jquery-mobile/1.2.0-beta.1"
[09:23:22] <gseguin> OK%
[09:23:22] <gseguin> ghislain.seguin@macjiver ~
[09:23:22] <gseguin> [10084]$ curl "http://jq02.jquery.com:3100/v1/jquery/jquery-mobile/1.2.0-rc.1"
[09:23:23] <gseguin> {}%
[09:23:41] <gseguin> the directory is there
[09:23:55] <gseguin> don't know what's going on
[09:24:57] <johnbender> gseguin: do you have a way to debug the issue?
[09:25:05] <johnbender> sounds like it's part of the builder
[09:25:09] <gseguin> try to reproduce locally
[09:25:14] <gseguin> I will do that
[09:25:34] <gseguin> maybe I should use Vagrant for that, I heard good things about it
[09:25:51] <gseguin> :P
[09:26:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/6ef910d929edaa4c479eef61a814beb82b685c0f#commitcomment-1876909
[09:26:30] <johnbender> gseguin: :)
[09:27:11] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/6ef910d929edaa4c479eef61a814beb82b685c0f#commitcomment-1876909
[09:27:12] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[09:28:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'd like to get an answer on the commit first
[09:28:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: and there's a check against options in popup that doesn't make sense to me
[09:32:23] <gseguin> johnbender: Vagrant installed
[09:32:28] <toddmparker_> ok, i'd rather make sure that commit makes sense
[09:32:29] <gseguin> how do I use it?
[09:32:45] <toddmparker_> but i don't see anything else that would hold up us releasing
[09:32:51] <gseguin> how do I reproduce the jq02 environment ?
[09:32:55] <toddmparker_> the only question is whether we need to so another rc
[09:36:09] <johnbender> gseguin: do you have access to the infrastructure project?
[09:36:13] <johnbender> I'm under the impression you do
[09:36:20] <gseguin> I do
[09:36:27] <johnbender> gseguin: checkout puppet-stage
[09:36:31] <johnbender> cd vagrant
[09:36:53] <johnbender> vagrant up jq02
[09:38:48] <gseguin> thanks!
[09:39:02] <johnbender> gseguin: I haven't tried that one myself so let me know how it works
[09:39:23] <johnbender> it's also possible that gnarf has made alterations manually that haven't been ported into the puppet manifests
[09:39:27] <johnbender> but I doubt that
[09:39:46] <gseguin> updating my VirtualBox
[09:41:09] <toddmparker_> figured. we made enough changes
[09:41:21] <toddmparker_> ok, we can do a quick rc either late this week or early next
[09:43:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah
[09:43:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: also I just spotted this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/14855adea8706fd5e9743c5abb2480340358e468
[09:44:06] <johnbender> it breaks the plugin that allows query params on the end of a hash
[09:44:13] <johnbender> it might be a simple fix
[10:00:35] <johnbender> gseguin: any luck?
[10:00:49] <gseguin> it
[10:00:53] <gseguin> 's doing stuff
[10:01:31] <johnbender> gseguin: that's good
[10:01:45] <gseguin> argh

[10:02:38] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[10:03:15] <johnbender> gseguin: what command did you run?
[10:03:22] <johnbender> citadel shouldn't be created
[10:03:23] <gseguin> vagrant up
[10:03:32] <gseguin> inside the vagrant directory
[10:03:39] <johnbender> scroll up: `vagrant up jq02`
[10:03:49] <gseguin> that didn't work
[10:03:50] <johnbender> `vagrant destroy`
[10:04:01] <johnbender> hmm
[10:04:03] <johnbender> let me take a look
[10:04:39] <gseguin> ha!
[10:04:46] <gseguin> vagrant up jq02.stage
[10:04:49] <gseguin> that worked
[10:05:17] <johnbender> gseguin: ah, vagrant jq02.stage
[10:05:20] <johnbender> yah
[10:05:37] <gseguin> alright it's doing stuff again
[10:05:40] <johnbender> you might want to add another entry for jq02 to the config.yml
[10:05:48] <johnbender> gseguin: you'll want to destroy the other boxes
[10:05:54] <gseguin> done
[10:06:32] <johnbender> gseguin: do a v status
[10:06:35] <johnbender> err
[10:06:38] <johnbender> `vagrant status`
[10:07:04] <gseguin> will do once it's done doing whatever it's doing
[10:07:54] <johnbender> gseguin: kk, you might have like 5 vms running :P
[10:08:05] <johnbender> `vagrant up` for the multi vm environment ups them all :)

[10:09:15] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: you around?
[10:09:22] <johnbender> gseguin: yah it's up but the puppet run failed
[10:09:23] <ryanneufeld> oish
[10:09:36] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: any idea about that failure?
[10:09:48] <ryanneufeld> sec
[10:10:35] <gseguin> johnbender: now how do I login to that VM?
[10:10:48] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: vagrant ssh
[10:10:53] <johnbender> gseguin: `vagrant ssh jq02.stage`
[10:10:54] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: vagrant ssh jq02.staeg
[10:10:58] <ryanneufeld> yeah, what he said
[10:11:01] <johnbender> :)
[10:11:09] <gseguin> thanks
[10:11:16] <ryanneufeld> oh gseguin you need to do a git submodule update --init
[10:11:25] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[10:11:27] <gseguin> ha!
[10:11:28] <johnbender> on the infra project
[10:11:30] <ryanneufeld> oh gseguin you need to do a `git submodule update --init`
[10:11:32] <gseguin> thanks ryanneufeld
[10:11:40] <ryanneufeld> then `vagrant provision`
[10:11:56] <ryanneufeld> then `vagrant provision jq02.stage` *
[10:12:09] <ryanneufeld> can't type this morning
[10:12:24] <ryanneufeld> also, Yay! i was useful
[10:12:40] <gseguin> thank you
[10:13:11] * gseguin is provisioning
[10:13:25] <ryanneufeld> fun to watch isn't it?
[10:13:37] <gseguin> yeah it's pretty neat
[10:13:52] <johnbender> gseguin: ryanneufeld: both of you are welcome :P
[10:13:57] * johnbender is an arrogant prick
[10:14:09] <gseguin> be back in a few
[10:14:14] * johnbender hasn't contributed to the project in more than a year 
[10:14:50] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: is a slacker
[10:15:08] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: _brah_ I've been busy trying to get into grad school :)
[10:15:17] <ryanneufeld> lol
[10:15:19] <ryanneufeld> I know
[10:16:16] <ryanneufeld> good for you though, grad school is hard work
[10:17:27] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I can't wait
[10:17:34] <johnbender> taking my second GRE tomorrow actually
[10:18:59] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: I've considered a masters
[10:19:02] <ryanneufeld> but it seems like a lot of work
[10:19:05] <ryanneufeld> and i'm kinda lazy
[10:19:47] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I want to get my phd so I can do research for a living
[10:20:29] <ryanneufeld> you'll be among the elite
[10:20:39] <johnbender> lol
[10:22:38] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to figure out what mitch has done with the branches on vagrant
[10:22:49] <ryanneufeld> it's kinda odd to have branches that are not really branches
[10:22:51] <ryanneufeld> :S
[10:23:45] <johnbender> its just the docs markdown and then the html generated from the makrdown
[10:23:48] <johnbender> *markdown
[10:23:50] <ryanneufeld> ah
[10:23:54] <johnbender> so gh-pages is the generated version
[10:23:57] <ryanneufeld> I see
[10:24:03] <johnbender> because github automatically serves those
[10:24:10] <ryanneufeld> orly?
[10:24:14] <johnbender> yah gh-pages
[10:24:31] <johnbender> I have a _ton_ of those for presentations and other bits
[10:24:36] <ryanneufeld> nice
[10:24:45] <ryanneufeld> I'll contrib to the docs repo then
[10:24:49] <ryanneufeld> seems to be the right place
[10:34:40] <johnbender> gseguin: what's the word
[10:35:03] <gseguin> how do I login with my userid ?
[10:35:14] <gseguin> it looks like it worked
[10:35:49] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[10:49:18] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: vagrant makes it pretty easy eh?
[10:51:20] <johnbender> gseguin: are you inside the vm?
[10:51:36] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: it does, it's pretty awesome
[10:51:51] <gseguin> johnbender: now I am, but I'm logged in as vagrant
[10:52:00] <ryanneufeld> su <your username>
[10:52:00] <johnbender> gseguin: `su <username>` ?
[10:52:09] <ryanneufeld> lulz
[10:52:34] <ryanneufeld> alternatively you can find out the IP, and ssh username@ip
[10:52:59] <gseguin> duh!
[10:53:02] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm assuming the users stuff is sorted on the vm via the puppet manifests (which I imagine is the case)
[10:53:04] * gseguin feels dumb
[10:53:32] <johnbender> gseguin: I know you are just distracted with how awesome vagrant is
[10:53:46] <gseguin> must be that
[10:54:12] * gseguin is in awe
[10:54:49] <gseguin> why can't I run `sudo puppet agent --test` ?
[10:55:48] <ryanneufeld> because vagrant copies the puppet manifests into a tmp dir
[10:55:55] <ryanneufeld> and then executes puppet manually afaik
[10:56:10] <ryanneufeld> I'm not terribly familiar with the jq0n vms though
[10:56:18] <ryanneufeld> gnarf would be the guy to poke on that one
[10:57:19] <johnbender> gseguin: there's a TODO/NOTE in the vagrant config to share the infra files at the /etc spot for puppet manifest
[10:57:22] <johnbender> *s
[10:57:55] <johnbender> I didn't/don't know enough about puppet to be sure if that would work properly
[10:58:20] <johnbender> gseguin: reasonable complaint but for now `vagrant provision` is just as good
[10:58:23] <johnbender> or nearly
[10:58:33] <johnbender> obviously you have to have another shell open
[10:58:44] <gseguin> I do
[10:58:57] <gseguin> let me log out and vagrant provision it
[10:58:59] <johnbender> gseguin: are you able to access the service
[10:59:27] <gseguin> it's not started
[10:59:55] <gseguin> that's why I wanted to run puppet to start it for me the same way it does it on jq02.stage
[11:00:22] <johnbender> gseguin: `vagrant up` runs the puppet manifest for you
[11:00:27] <johnbender> so it should be up :(
[11:00:33] <gseguin> it's not :(
[11:00:38] <johnbender> unless I missed something
[11:00:50] <johnbender> gseguin: let me take a look at the manifests
[11:00:50] <gseguin> ok let me roll back in the history to see any error
[11:02:01] <gseguin> oh yeah, there are plenty of errors
[11:02:21] <gseguin> first one is:
[11:02:22] <gseguin> ERR! Error: EACCES, mkdir '/var/www/.npm'
[11:03:09] <ryanneufeld> does that file/dir exist?
[11:03:20] <ryanneufeld> can you gist the logs?
[11:04:48] <johnbender> gseguin: you might also try running /etc/init.d/node-init
[11:04:48] * gseguin is gisting
[11:04:58] <johnbender> though I would sort out the errors first
[11:05:35] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I'm going to guess that this has something to with running puppet apply as vagrant
[11:05:38] <johnbender> but not sure
[11:05:45] <ryanneufeld> could be
[11:05:54] <gseguin> https://gist.github.com/febcdb5c9dfc44647a92
[11:06:00] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: if nothing else we should try to convince gnarf to use vagrant too
[11:06:03] <ryanneufeld> gonna stand up jq02.stage locally
[11:06:04] <johnbender> to make it consistent
[11:06:13] <ryanneufeld> I thought he was

[11:06:34] <ryanneufeld> that should be fixed with an update to puppet
[11:06:44] <ryanneufeld> when you stood it up originally, was it able to upgrade puppet?
[11:06:57] <gseguin> no idea
[11:07:03] <gseguin> I wasn't looking
[11:07:10] <gseguin> I can start again
[11:07:18] <ryanneufeld> you'd have to destroy and then up
[11:07:20] <ryanneufeld> I'm uppping now
[11:07:25] <gseguin> ok
[11:07:44] <ryanneufeld> waiting for codereview at work, I got a min to spare :p
[11:08:01] <gseguin> thanks for looking into this
[11:09:50] <ryanneufeld> np
[11:10:30] <ryanneufeld> I still don't understand why it's downloading a puppet deb file when debian has a stable version of it
[11:10:58] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: because the stable version breaks
[11:11:06] <ryanneufeld> orly?
[11:11:08] <johnbender> on the metadata in the sqlite
[11:11:16] <ryanneufeld> oh
[11:11:27] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: it was a bug in the older version of puppet
[11:11:36] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[11:11:38] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I think I've spotted the issue
[11:11:42] <johnbender> the user isn't defined for this exec
[11:11:44] * gseguin has no clue about this convo
[11:12:34] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/modules/jquery/manifests/gitclone.pp#L53
[11:12:49] <ryanneufeld> k
[11:12:59] <ryanneufeld> wat
[11:13:14] <johnbender> err
[11:13:18] <ryanneufeld> line 55?
[11:13:24] <johnbender> nevermind it does indeed specify the user
[11:13:51] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: the directory is wrong though
[11:13:57] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:14:47] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: it looks like the $name is wrong
[11:14:53] <johnbender> $real_path
[11:15:20] <johnbender> hrm
[11:15:22] <johnbender> nevermind
[11:15:27] <johnbender> still learning the puppet dsl
[11:16:05] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I'm waiting for my local to finish provisioning
[11:16:13] <ryanneufeld> it's at sizzle.js now
[11:16:17] <ryanneufeld> Siteupdater
[11:16:31] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: it's clearly running the the npm install in the wrong directory
[11:16:56] <ryanneufeld> what would cause that?
[11:17:23] <johnbender> no clue but this is weird: "cwd /var/www/amd-builder.jquerymobile.com"
[11:17:34] <johnbender> that's where it should be running the npm install
[11:17:52] <johnbender> gseguin: how much do you know about npm?
[11:17:55] <ryanneufeld> cwd...
[11:18:06] <ryanneufeld> what shell is it running
[11:18:22] <gseguin> johnbender: not a lot
[11:18:22] <johnbender> lol I like how npm recommends you run it as root because you don't have access to a directory lololololololol
[11:18:40] <johnbender> when in doubt just run as root!
[11:18:44] <johnbender> trololol
[11:18:50] <ryanneufeld> ugh, I HATE that
[11:18:52] <gseguin> that's when you want to use -g
[11:19:55] <johnbender> gseguin: ryanneufeld: `sudo -u www-data npm install` from the cwd should produce the same results
[11:20:01] <gseguin> I do: `chmod 777 /usr/local` instead
[11:20:02] <johnbender> /var/www/amd-builder.jquerymobile.com
[11:20:12] <johnbender> gseguin: lololol
[11:20:27] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: please never do that
[11:20:36] <gseguin> :D
[11:20:48] <johnbender> chmod -Rf 777 /
[11:21:06] <ryanneufeld> I CAN EDIT ALL THE THINGS!!!!ELEVEN
[11:21:23] <johnbender> gseguin: can you try running that command?
[11:21:32] <gseguin> that chmod ?
[11:21:35] <ryanneufeld> I just had this fail sudo -u www-data npm install returned 3
[11:21:35] <johnbender> no
[11:21:36] <gseguin> :D
[11:21:37] <johnbender> the npm
[11:21:49] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: but the directory does exist
[11:22:02] <gnarf> so
[11:22:07] <johnbender> why is npm trying to create .npm
[11:22:07] <gnarf> NPM uses a temp directory
[11:22:14] <gnarf> and its really lame
[11:22:15] <johnbender> is that because its the www-data's users' home dir?
[11:22:19] <gnarf> yes
[11:22:23] <johnbender> gnarf: :/
[11:22:31] <ryanneufeld> and www-data doesn't really have a homedir
[11:22:34] <johnbender> right
[11:22:36] <gnarf> its /var/www
[11:22:42] <johnbender> well at least we know what it is
[11:22:53] <gnarf> caused me an issue or two already
[11:23:01] <gnarf> So I've been using a different user instead
[11:23:26] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah same error
[11:23:35] <gseguin> EACCES
[11:23:47] <gseguin> Error: EACCES, mkdir '/var/www/.npm'
[11:24:06] <johnbender> gnarf: is that in puppet-master or puppet-stage?
[11:24:24] <ryanneufeld> should be stage
[11:24:33] <gseguin> I'm on stage
[11:24:33] <gnarf> johnbender: master and stage at the moment, I manually made that directory somewhere to solve the issue it was having
[11:25:01] <gseguin> I gotta go grab lunch
[11:25:02] <gnarf> I didn't realize I still had something using the www-data account
[11:25:07] <gseguin> I'll be back soon
[11:25:51] <johnbender> gnarf: alright, so there's some way to config npm to use another directory?
[11:26:19] <gnarf> johnbender: i think so, but I couldn't get it to work right everywhere
[11:26:30] <gnarf> I tried to get puppet to create ~$user/.npm
[11:26:36] <gnarf> so it would make one for www-data
[11:26:52] <gnarf> but it wouldn't let me use "~user" paths
[11:27:19] <gnarf> temp fix = mkdir /var/www/.npm ; chown www-data /var/www/.npm
[11:27:31] <gnarf> perm fix = don't use the www-data user :)
[11:27:45] <ryanneufeld> www-data should have write access to /var/www
[11:27:49] <ryanneufeld> shouldn't it?
[11:28:10] <gnarf> not by default, but I suppose we could give it write to /var/www
[11:28:36] <ryanneufeld> I think it should have it
[11:28:52] <ryanneufeld> isn't that user that apache/nginx would run as?
[11:29:07] <ryanneufeld> 755 would be ideal
[11:29:48] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: yeah, but generally you don't let www-data actually write to anything other than like temp cache dirs
[11:30:06] <ryanneufeld> file uploads?
[11:31:44] * johnbender Shakes his fist in the air! FFFFFFUUUUUUUUUU NPM.
[11:32:14] <ryanneufeld> I think this is what the node hater haters say are "growing pains"
[11:32:54] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: gnarf: what about .npmrc
[11:33:09] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: I think that's what the node appologists say :/
[11:33:14] <gnarf> johnbender: I kinda like ryanneufeld's idea of just making /var/www owner www-data
[11:33:31] <gnarf> it should work then
[11:33:32] <ryanneufeld> chmod 755
[11:33:38] <ryanneufeld> should keep it secure enough
[11:33:44] <johnbender> up to you guys
[11:34:19] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: gnarf: alternately we can creat .npm and chmod that
[11:34:27] <johnbender> or at least it seems that way
[11:34:32] <johnbender> gnarf: I know that was the temp fix
[11:34:46] <johnbender> that seems less risky to me
[11:34:56] <johnbender> but my grasp of permissions issues is weak at best
[11:35:03] <johnbender> I 100% defer to you guys
[11:35:36] <gnarf> I'm not that concerned with any process' we have creating directories in /var/www - its not like it automatically sets up new vhosts for those or anything
[11:39:48] <toddmparker_> it's all neckbeardy up in here today
[11:41:04] <ryanneuf_> yeah, a little
[11:41:21] <ryanneuf_> I missed some convo, our interwebs went down
[11:44:57] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: did you want to make that change to the manifests? Maybe the better question is, do you have time?
[11:45:26] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: my daughter is home sick and she just woke up from her nap
[11:45:42] <ryanneufeld> ooh
[11:45:52] <ryanneufeld> I missed a bunch of the convo
[11:46:00] <ryanneufeld> but I'll take a quick look at the manifests
[11:47:13] <ryanneufeld> what needs to be changed?
[11:50:09] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: gnarf https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-stage/modules/jquery/manifests/gitclone.pp#L26
[11:50:21] <ryanneufeld> looks like that should already be owned by the user..
[11:51:00] <gnarf> Thats the place it gets installed
[11:51:20] <ryanneufeld> checking on the vm it's root:root
[11:51:29] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: i think the fix is in the "webhost" node to just file {"/var/www": owner => www-data, mode => 0755, ensure=>directory }
[11:51:46] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: thats $real_path is the destination for the install of whatever it's cloning
[11:51:52] <gnarf> which is /var/www/________
[11:51:55] <ryanneufeld> ahhh
[11:52:31] <ryanneufeld> I'm testing that suggestion now gnarf
[11:53:15] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: we might need to add that to any apache hosts manually, but I don't think I'm going to be using apache for anything on the live cluster
[11:55:04] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[11:55:11] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that didn't seem to change anything
[11:56:28] <ryanneufeld> oh, could it be apparmor?
[11:57:00] <gnarf> could it be wha?
[11:57:23] <ryanneufeld> nvm
[11:57:26] <ryanneufeld> ubuntu thing
[11:57:30] <ryanneufeld> I'm drunk or something
[11:58:27] <gnarf> did that not work?
[11:58:41] <gnarf> did it actually set the owner on /var/www ?
[11:58:48] <gnarf> might be a two pass kinda run there
[11:59:07] <gnarf> although I think "file" resources automatically should require the parent directory file resource
[12:00:05] <ryanneufeld> it didn't set the owner
[12:01:48] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: I gotta bounce for a meeting
[12:01:50] <ryanneufeld> back in about an hour
[12:20:40] <johnbender> gseguin: when you come back you can just create that .npm dir and chown it for www-data in the interim
[12:24:51] <gseguin> aaand back
[12:28:06] <gseguin> johnbender: it wanted a /var/www/tmp as well
[12:28:28] <gseguin> so I `chown www-data /var/www`
[12:28:38] <gseguin> npm went through
[12:31:23] <johnbender> gseguin: alright, try running the provision again unless that's what you meant by "npm went through"
[12:31:52] * gseguin is provisioning as we speak
[12:32:04] <gseguin> looking much better
[12:34:21] <johnbender> gseguin: nice
[12:37:21] <gseguin> woohoo! it's up
[12:37:37] <gseguin> thanks johnbender & ryanneufeld
[12:39:41] <gseguin> aaaaaarrrrrgghhh!
[12:39:50] <gseguin> works for me :( :(
[12:40:21] <gseguin> the same curl that craps out on jq02 works on my vagrant vm
[12:41:18] <gseguin> I'm giving up computers, I'm going to become a shepherd
[12:42:52] <johnbender> gnarf: ^
[12:43:14] <johnbender> gseguin: so here's what I would do
[12:43:21] <johnbender> go take a look at what's running on the server
[12:43:38] <johnbender> gseguin: see if you can spot a difference
[12:43:42] <gseguin> same exact command
[12:43:48] <johnbender>  if you need to monkey aroud you can always do it locally first
[12:44:02] <johnbender> gseguin: why don't you try bouncing the service
[12:44:03] <gnarf> gseguin: what sha is the repo on?
[12:44:10] <gnarf> gseguin: have you pushed any updates recently?
[12:44:29] <gnarf> also johnbender++: sudo /etc/init.d/amd-builder
[12:44:31] <gnarf> restart
[12:44:32] <gseguin> johnbender: did that already
[12:44:39] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I was just about to point that out
[12:45:04] <gnarf> gseguin: check ownership of the folders/processes?
[12:45:35] <gseguin> yep ownerships are good
[12:46:42] <gseguin> gnarf: I haven't pushed anything to the service
[12:46:58] <gseguin> just to the puppet config so it creates the 1.2.0-rc.1
[12:47:24] <gseguin> gnarf: sha of which repo?
[12:47:46] <gnarf> gseguin: amd-builder
[12:47:55] <gseguin> lemme check
[12:49:06] <gseguin> ha!
[12:49:24] <gseguin> gnarf: the one on jq02 is one rev behind
[12:49:35] <gnarf> gseguin: push a semver tag
[12:49:39] <gnarf> it should update itself
[12:49:53] <gseguin> ok
[12:50:03] <gnarf> git tag 0.0.1 ; git tags --push
[12:50:12] <gnarf> er
[12:50:15] <gnarf> push --tags
[12:50:34] <gseguin> I'll sync it up with the package.json
[12:50:44] <gnarf> yah
[12:50:52] <gnarf> any push to master should update on stge
[12:50:58] <gnarf> any semver tag should update on live
[12:51:22] <gseguin> what's weird is that stage is one rev behind as well
[12:54:56] <gseguin> gnarf: how long does it take to update?
[12:55:14] <gnarf> post-receive timing
[12:55:18] <gnarf> semit-immediately
[12:55:32] <gnarf> but it didn't seem too
[12:55:34] <gnarf> that is odd
[12:55:38] <gnarf> darnit
[12:55:56] <gnarf> oh
[12:56:02] <gseguin> it did not indeed
[12:56:23] <gnarf> do you have http://jq02.jquery.com:3333 and http://jq02.stage.jquery.com:3333 set up as post receive hooks in github?
[12:56:25] <gseguin> oh wait
[12:56:29] <gnarf> I'll manually update this one btw
[12:56:35] <gseguin> I only have the stage hook
[12:57:52] <gnarf> it should be updated now
[12:57:53] <gseguin> added the hook to live
[12:58:10] <gnarf> now it doesn't want to run :(
[12:58:15] <gseguin> still craping out
[12:58:17] <gnarf> oh nvm
[12:58:26] <gnarf> damn ps list in the middle lol
[12:59:05] <gnarf> gseguin: not sure what else it could be...
[12:59:21] <gseguin> I'll try removing that dir and recreating it
[13:01:35] <gseguin> no luck... still stuck
[13:08:37] <gseguin> same crap on stage
[13:08:57] <gseguin> exept on stage even 1.2.0-beta.1 craps out
[13:09:06] <gseguin> s/exept/except/
[13:12:03] <johnbender> gseguin: do you have any way to debug?
[13:17:24] <gseguin> locally yes
[13:21:49] <gseguin> johnbender: but I can't reproduce locally
[13:22:03] <johnbender> gseguin: I meant debugging remotely
[13:22:07] <johnbender> gseguin: on stage
[13:22:13] <gseguin> I'll add more logging
[13:22:15] <johnbender> gseguin: it's a staging server
[13:22:22] <johnbender> gseguin: that's what I'm thinking
[13:22:27] <johnbender> just dump more in and deploy to stage
[13:22:37] <gnarf> ++
[13:22:38] <johnbender> provided my conception of stage is in alignment with gnarf
[13:22:44] <gnarf> :)
[13:22:44] <johnbender> looks like it is :)
[13:22:50] <gnarf> stage is a sandbox
[13:22:53] <gseguin> can I just modify the server.js ?
[13:22:56] <gnarf> rm -rf the whole thing if you want to
[13:23:11] <johnbender> gnarf: color me glad to have staging boxes for all that stuff
[13:23:12] <gnarf> sure, just put it back or the git update might break
[13:23:14] <gseguin> I don't need to go through github, right?
[13:23:31] <gseguin> k
[13:23:58] <gseguin> AH! vi my friend!
[13:24:24] <gseguin> without syntax coloring, how I've missed you
[13:24:35] <gnarf> :)
[13:24:45] <gnarf> feel free to toy with your .vimrc
[13:24:58] <gseguin> heh :)
[13:25:14] <gnarf> i get made fun of cuz i use nano
[13:32:59] <ryanneufeld> if it works for you
[13:42:39] <ryanneufeld> gnarf: do you recall what the issue was with warning: Unrecognised escape sequence '\.' in file /tmp/vagrant-puppet/manifests/nodes/services.pp at line 171
[13:42:56] <gnarf> no
[13:43:20] <johnbender> gseguin: also it would be good to identify why it isn't an issue for your vagrant instance
[13:43:49] <gseguin> once I know what's going on on stge
[13:43:51] <johnbender> gnarf: have you been using vagrant or are you still using the cluster that you referred to
[13:43:55] <johnbender> gseguin: yar
[13:44:04] <gseguin> I'll see if I can make it happen on my vagrant vm
[13:44:06] <johnbender> s/referred to/referred to?/
[13:44:13] <johnbender> gseguin: that would be great
[13:44:32] <gnarf> johnbender: i'm still using my home brewed VMs right now, they are conveniently exactly how i want them already :)
[13:47:00] <gseguin> ok so I know what's going on
[13:47:06] <gseguin> don't know yet how we got there
[13:47:14] <gnarf> yah?
[13:47:18] <gseguin> somehow the bare repo is not up to date
[13:47:31] <gseguin> it does not have the tag 1.2.0-rc.1
[13:47:51] <gseguin> oh wait a minute
[13:47:53] <gnarf> want me to try sending out post-receives from jquery-mobile?
[13:48:18] <gseguin> did we add the hooks on the jquery-mobile repo?
[13:48:24] <gnarf> http://jq02.jquery.com:3100/post_receive and http://jq02.stage.jquery.com:3100/post_receive are both there
[13:48:29] <gnarf> those are correct right?
[13:48:36] <gseguin> yes they are
[13:48:43] <gseguin> opps
[13:48:47] <gseguin> no
[13:48:52] <gnarf> post-receive ?
[13:49:25] <gseguin> it is /post_receive
[13:49:37] <gseguin> but for some reason it 404'd
[13:50:29] <gseguin> OH I know you did a GET
[13:50:36] <gseguin> that route only takes a POST
[13:50:48] <gseguin> yes it's the correct urls
[13:56:57] <agcolom> quick question: navbars, header bars and footer bars are 3 separate widgets?
[13:57:11] <agcolom> and Hi btw!
[13:58:24] <gnarf> gseguin: i just hit "test hook"
[13:58:36] <gnarf> gseguin: and could hit it again if needed
[13:58:40] <gnarf> did it do whatever it needed to do?
[14:00:38] <agcolom> toddmparker_: As I'll miss tomorrow's meeting, here's my update for this week:
[14:01:15] <toddmparker_> mind sending me an email agcolom
[14:01:26] <agcolom> toddmparker_: sure:
[14:02:36] <toddmparker_> thanks
[14:02:42] <toddmparker_> and i agree on your feedback on docs
[14:02:49] <toddmparker_> we definitely need a highlighter
[14:03:28] <toddmparker_> one thing I discussed today is if the API docs you're doing should be the primary docs and we'd thin down the current docs to be more of a kitchen sink demo site
[14:03:52] <toddmparker_> so all the API stuff would only live on the site as you've been working on it
[14:04:03] <toddmparker_> and this would be a pure jQM set of demos
[14:07:58] <gseguin> EUREKA!
[14:08:13] <gseguin> gnarf, johnbender: fetch does not pull tags
[14:08:22] <gseguin> by default
[14:08:28] <gnarf> gseguin: fetch --tags ?
[14:08:33] <gseguin> yeah
[14:08:36] <gnarf> gseguin: also consider
[14:08:39] <gnarf> hold on
[14:08:40] <gnarf> gotta find it
[14:08:42] <gseguin> which is not what I was doing
[14:09:27] <gnarf> "git remote update"
[14:09:29] <gnarf> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6150188/how-to-update-a-git-clone-mirror
[14:09:36] <agcolom> toddmparker_: oh cool!
[14:10:16] <agcolom> toddmparker_: I've sent the email... Please let me know if you have any preference for the order to complete the remaining widgets...
[14:10:29] <gseguin> gnarf: so instead of doing a clone bare I should do a mirror
[14:10:42] <gseguin> and instead of fetch, do `remote update`
[14:10:49] <gnarf> just the second half
[14:10:56] <gnarf> i think the first is unnessecary
[14:11:03] <gnarf> but i think remote update will do a full fetch
[14:11:28] <gseguin> kewl
[14:11:38] <gnarf> might want to test it
[14:11:40] <gseguin> let me change that, revert, commit and push
[14:15:54] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone...
[14:16:48] <johnbender> agcolom: gnight!
[14:20:52] <agcolom> johnbender: btw I am interested in any technique you may have to cope with jet lag! I'm dreading the -5h!
[14:24:13] <gseguin> agcolom: just party all night the night before the flight
[14:25:57] <agcolom> gseguin: I like that ;-)
[14:26:07] <johnbender> agcolom: don't go to sleep until the normal time and make sure you're tired
[14:26:23] <johnbender> agcolom: also, when you wake up 3 hours into your deep sleep, roll over
[14:26:29] <johnbender> and go back to sleep
[14:26:35] <johnbender> always works for me :)
[14:26:41] <agcolom> ok ;-)
[14:26:55] <johnbender> agcolom: alternately you can take nyquil if you're worried about sleeping
[14:26:58] <johnbender> :P
[14:26:58] <gseguin> agcolom: many years ago, when I was young and crazy I would litteraly get out of the club, jump in a cab to the airport and fly to SFO
[14:27:41] <agcolom> johnbender: yes, we have nytol here... seems to work...
[14:28:15] <agcolom> gseguin: OMG!
[14:29:05] <gseguin> neighbors in the plane were usually not too happy with my alcoholic breath at 10AM :D
[14:29:09] <toddmparker_> ok, blogging the new logo folks
[14:29:21] <agcolom> Well, I'll just hope for nice neighbours on the flight.... Last time I traveled from Chicago to London, the lady behind me was putting perfume on every 30minutes! Was really horrible!
[14:29:39] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Excellent!
[14:29:48] <gseguin> yay! toddmparker_
[14:29:50] <agcolom> I really like it!
[14:29:56] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/09/19/new-jquery-mobile-logo/
[14:30:02] <agcolom> Nice, neat and simple...
[14:31:40] <toddmparker_> thanks
[14:31:41] <agcolom> toddmparker_: I really like this sentence: The bright center point of greatest overlap is where we come in: the library that makes it possible to support this diversity with a single codebase that adapts to all sizes, input methods and capabilities.
[14:31:55] <agcolom> simply beautiful!
[14:32:09] <agcolom> Well done!
[14:33:07] <agcolom> gseguin: btw Garann is in Paris!
[14:34:22] <gseguin> oh that's right on her way to JSConf.EU
[14:34:27] <gseguin> I saw her blog post
[14:34:34] <gseguin> did you get to meet her?
[14:35:29] <agcolom> gseguin: no. I don't know whether she's coming to London.... I tried to help help with the wifi issue but I think she went offline... hence the wifi issue! ;-)
[14:35:49] <agcolom> help her ^ (not help help!)
[14:36:10] <agcolom> right... this time I am really going to bed! Goodnight johnbender gseguin toddmparker_
[14:36:26] <gseguin> good night agcolom
[14:37:44] <gnarf> gseguin: we get that issue solved? I'm about to take off for the day
[14:37:54] <gseguin> testing
[14:37:56] <gnarf> can hang out for another hour or so to help if needed
[14:38:09] <gnarf> lemme know if you want me to push a hook from the github admin page
[14:38:15] <gseguin> the remote update seems to do the trick
[14:38:24] <gseguin> commiting and pushing
[14:38:41] <gnarf> coo - lemme know if/when the next problem arises :)
[14:41:14] <gseguin> gnarf: stage still does not update when I push to master
[14:42:29] <ryanneufeld> pushing to master should update stage?
[14:42:38] <gseguin> yup
[14:42:44] <gnarf> gseguin: ownership issues
[14:42:57] <gseguin> ah
[14:43:21] <gnarf> gseguin: I'm gonna rm -rf the whole builder on stage and make puppet reinstall it
[14:43:33] <gseguin> sounds good
[14:48:18] <ryanneufeld> haha, <3 puppet
[15:01:46] <gnarf> ryanneufeld / gseguin - https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/commit/9c32df3c0bf22730d78408dbd308ba74f1643ac9
[15:01:56] <gnarf> this should fix the errors with the jq02 vm
[15:03:38] <gseguin> cool
[15:04:00] <gseguin> in the meantime it doesnt seem like it's completely working
[15:04:07] <gseguin> I just pushed a tag to jquery-mobile
[15:04:33] <gseguin> and live doesn't seem to update its tags
[15:10:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/UsLkJA
[15:10:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added new jQM logo to docs homepage - toddparker
[15:20:38] <ryanneufeld> you knwo what I just noticed
[15:20:44] <ryanneufeld> when you click on that link
[15:20:51] <ryanneufeld> there is no indication what branch you're looking at
[15:32:20] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: yeah, commits don't know where they are in the tree
[15:32:26] <gnarf> on a github page
[15:32:31] <ryanneufeld> GH does
[15:32:36] <ryanneufeld> doesn't it?
[15:37:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/x56vww
[15:37:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added  assets for iOS startup with new logo - toddparker
[15:39:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/W0l5Dw
[15:39:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs: removed float on Themeroller logo - toddparker
[15:41:22] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi - I might need some help with the assets for the iOS homescreen...in a rush and can't quite get things to work
[15:41:30] <toddmparker_> made some assets anyway
[15:41:36] <toddmparker_> still need iPad startups
[15:42:10] <gnarf> ryanneufeld: maybe they should render a link to https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/network with the commit highlighted (hit shift-right and see what i mean)
[15:44:08] <ryanneufeld> shift right?
[15:44:39] <ryanneufeld> the thingis
[15:44:47] <ryanneufeld> if you click on the 'commits' tab
[15:44:52] <ryanneufeld> they know there what branch it's in
[15:44:58] <ryanneufeld> so they clearly have the information
[15:45:30] <gnarf> but thats cause its based on the branch
[15:45:39] <gnarf> and you look at the history of the branch
[15:45:43] <gnarf> when you are on a commit
[15:45:52] <gnarf> you cant go "forward" to find the HEAD it's on
[15:47:07] <gnarf> btw - also - try git log --graph --pretty=format:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)<%an>%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative  ( i alias that in my .gitconfig to lg )
[15:52:20] <gnarf> gseguin: next time you cherry-pick --- can you cherry-pick -x please?
[15:59:00] <ryanneufeld> what does -x do?
[15:59:22] <gnarf> it just adds a comment in the commit message ssaying "cherry picked from ---------"
[15:59:32] <ryanneufeld> Ah, neato
[15:59:57] <gseguin> will do, sorry
[15:59:57] <gseguin> didn't know about -x
[16:06:12] <gseguin> so it still doesn't work though
[16:12:24] <gseguin> the service was down on jq02
[16:13:37] <gnarf> gseguin: hrm
[16:14:28] <gnarf> gseguin: does it need to get a post-receive from jquerymobile to get "updated" ?
[16:16:40] <gseguin> curling on http://localhost:3100/v1/jquery/jquery-mobile should have the same effect
[16:16:57] <gseguin> I just did a manual `git fetch --tags`
[16:17:06] <gnarf> sudo -u www-data ?
[16:17:11] <gseguin> yeah
[16:17:13] <gnarf> k
[16:17:13] <gnarf> :)
[16:17:32] <gseguin> at least the builder is back to working
[16:17:53] <gseguin> we need to figure out why the post-receive doesn't work
[21:36:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/M-JkgQ
[21:36:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #5037 - Docs: image vertical alignment - Jasper de Groot
[22:17:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: Re iOS startup images: the images are too big. You have to take 20px for the status bar into account
[22:19:00] <uGoMobi> will send you an email with the correct sizes
