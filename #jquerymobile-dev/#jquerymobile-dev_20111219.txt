[07:10:44] <toddmparker_> morning!
[08:43:19] <gseguin> good morning
[09:01:44] <toddmparker_> morning gseguin!
[09:02:11] <toddmparker_> gseguin, question for you. can you look at this and tell me if this this a bug? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3287
[09:02:12] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3287 on jquery-mobile, reported by pehrlich (3d, 9h ago): redirect not cleaning hash state
[09:13:49] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I can put it on my plate for Wednesday
[09:14:49] <toddmparker_> i'm not sure if you need to work on it now gseguin,just curious if at first glance this seems like an issue at all :)
[09:38:17] <toddmparker_> kinblas or johnbender - did you guys see this pull?
[09:38:18] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3302
[09:38:19] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by townxelliot (6m, 4s ago): Add autodividers functionality to listview
[09:38:41] <toddmparker_> it is an extension to add list dividers
[09:38:46] <kinblas> toddmparker: just saw it fly by
[09:38:51] <toddmparker_> seems well documented and tested
[09:40:32] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah, looks like the guy actually spent quite a bit of time getting his ducks in order
[09:40:48] <toddmparker_> yeah
[09:41:09] <kinblas> toddmparker_: the one thing I'd probably do
[09:41:17] <kinblas> is instead of relying on selectors
[09:41:25] <kinblas> make it so we can register a function to call
[09:41:38] <kinblas> and let that function do the searching how-ever-it-wants-to
[09:41:49] <kinblas> default impl of that function is whatever he does now
[09:42:32] <toddmparker_> good idea
[09:42:57] <toddmparker_> so we'd need to expose an extension point?
[09:43:02] <kinblas> ugh it uses jQuery pseudos
[09:43:06] <kinblas> which means slow sizzle
[09:43:20] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[09:43:25] <kinblas> so yeah it would be good to compartmentalize that in a func we can override
[09:43:32] <toddmparker_> ok
[09:43:43] <toddmparker_> so looks like more coordination is needed
[09:43:44] <kinblas> johnbender: you might want to take a look
[09:43:58] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm not thumbs-downing ... if johnbender is ok, and you want it
[09:44:04] <toddmparker_> i forwarded an email from the intel guys
[09:44:05] <kinblas> we can take it, and improve it
[09:44:16] <kinblas> is that from the intel guys?
[09:45:09] <kinblas> toddmparker_: do you know what the github ids of the intel guys are?
[09:46:36] <johnbender> kinblas: link?
[09:46:36] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw
[09:46:46] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/gabrielschulhof
[09:46:55] <kinblas> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3302
[09:46:56] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by townxelliot (14m, 40s ago): Add autodividers functionality to listview
[09:47:00] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/townxelliot
[09:47:11] <johnbender> kinblas: is that related to the intel email?
[09:47:13] <toddmparker_> ^^ those 2 guys
[09:47:20] <kinblas> johnbender: no
[09:47:22] <johnbender> I supose I could just go look lol
[09:47:23] <johnbender> kk
[09:47:45] <kinblas> johnbender: toddmparker_ was just pointing out that the guy spent a lot of time getting his ducks in order
[09:47:54] <kinblas> johnbender: and I know todd is hot for that plugin :-P
[09:48:05] <johnbender> awwright
[09:48:16] <johnbender> I'm almost done with my review for sergey
[09:48:21] <johnbender> then I'll hop over there and take a look
[09:48:41] <kinblas> johnbender: my one suggestion was that we modify it so that the "find divider text" functionality be a configurable function instead of a selector
[09:48:47] <kinblas> that way it is more flexible
[09:49:08] <kinblas> his current selector way could be the default impl for said function
[09:49:57] <kinblas> johnbender: I also noticed he was using jQuery specific pseudo selectors which sets off the sloooow perf flag in my head
[09:51:34] <toddmparker_> i'd like to try and look them in here
[09:51:44] <toddmparker_> they are building a lot of stuff for tizen
[09:51:51] <toddmparker_> and it's super engineered
[09:51:59] <toddmparker_> but could be better with us involved
[09:52:10] <toddmparker_> and we can pull key stuff out
[09:52:37] <toddmparker_> did you guys see that email from them?
[09:52:50] <toddmparker_> less concerned about pullin the dividers in
[09:53:00] <toddmparker_> but more pulling them in
[09:53:16] <toddmparker_> btw - the popup script we're working with was written by gabriel there too
[09:53:43] <toddmparker_> i need to ask for a demo link for those plugins. they wrote a ton of stuff
[09:58:33] <johnbender> kinblas: kk
[10:01:18] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah saw the email ... how do you want to start talking? Have them demo at one of our meetings?
[10:01:28] <toddmparker_> maybe, yeah
[10:01:33] <toddmparker_> like to get 'em here too
[10:02:00] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so are we having a meeting Thursday? FYI bender, tyler and I are on PTO starting Thursday till the jan 2nd
[10:02:23] <kinblas> toddmparker_: Adobe is shutdown during those dates
[10:02:27] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[10:02:33] <toddmparker_> good to know, corporate slackers
[10:02:38] <kinblas> :-D
[10:02:47] <toddmparker_> so can you make thursday or are you already out?
[10:03:04] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I can set aside an hour for you :-P
[10:03:31] <kinblas> are the intel guys eastcoast?
[10:03:44] <kinblas> we can even move it earlier ... probably better for me/you
[10:04:12] <toddmparker_> yeah, i can do earlier
[10:19:03] <toddmparker_> just emailed
[10:27:34] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did the blackberry meeting get moved?
[10:47:05] <johnbender> ok
[10:47:12] <johnbender> looking into the other pull request
[10:58:32] <toddmparker_> johnbender: which bb meeting?
[10:58:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I thought I saw something fly by last week on the meeting with RIM
[10:59:01] <johnbender> since laurent was on vacation
[10:59:22] <toddmparker_> i think there is a meetin in early jan
[10:59:26] <johnbender> kk
[10:59:30] <johnbender> nevarmynd
[10:59:50] <toddmparker_> 9th
[11:02:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: super cool it's on my calendar thanks to your complex repeating invite
[11:11:51] <johnbender> kinblas: I feel like the $.fn.autodividers should be a method on the listview plugin proto
[11:12:07] <johnbender> $("#my-list").listview('autodividers')
[11:13:09] <johnbender> it would be nice to start there and then add in some callbacks for plugin devs in general
[11:13:20] <johnbender> later
[11:13:23] <kinblas> johnbender: how does one turn it on?
[11:13:31] <kinblas> data-autodividers="true"?
[11:13:39] <johnbender> kinblas: that autodividers?
[11:13:45] <johnbender> ugh
[11:13:51] <johnbender> let me try that again
[11:13:53] <Wilto> Hey folks.
[11:13:53] <bot-t> (11 hours 30 mins ago) <matjas> tell Wilto http://i.imgur.com/0aR9x.gif
[11:14:12] <Wilto> oh man amazing
[11:14:17] <johnbender> I wouldn't change the way it's turned on now
[11:15:02] <johnbender> if I understand what you mean by "turned on"
[11:17:49] <kinblas> johnbender: sorry I missed what you said before I asked
[11:17:58] <kinblas> so he is invoking things with an attribute eh?
[11:18:40] <johnbender> kinblas: yah
[11:18:59] <kinblas> oh I see what he's doing
[11:19:18] <kinblas> yeah, I would stay away from $.fn
[11:19:26] <johnbender> indeed
[11:19:33] <johnbender> per my PSA :P
[11:19:36] <kinblas> so instead, his plugin should
[11:19:50] <kinblas> $.mobile.listview.prototype.autodividers()
[11:19:55] <johnbender> yerp
[11:20:05] <johnbender> it should define that imo
[11:20:08] <johnbender> I can make that change though
[11:20:08] <kinblas> yeah that would be good
[11:20:11] <johnbender> that's minor
[11:20:21] <kinblas> yeah that's what I was saying to todd, if he wants it
[11:20:26] <kinblas> take it, then bend it to our will
[11:20:30] <johnbender> exactly
[11:20:38] <johnbender> he's got tests too so we're friends
[11:20:40] <Wilto> You guys are getting nefarious in here today, I see.
[11:20:44] <kinblas> lol
[11:21:02] <johnbender> Wilto: which reminds me, I have a post it note to ask you if you are testing the things you're workingo n
[11:21:06] <johnbender> the new stuff
[11:21:14] <kinblas> LOL
[11:21:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: gseguin: kinblas: NO NEW STUFF WITHOUT TESTS
[11:21:22] <Wilto> i uh (cough) well see about that the thing is
[11:21:29] <johnbender> I don't want to go back and write them again
[11:21:32] <johnbender> that's backwards
[11:21:47] * johnbender will not be pulling punches on this topic 
[11:21:49] <johnbender> ^^
[11:21:56] <Wilto> This is why I count on you to be The Enforcer, sir.
[11:22:00] <Wilto> A-testing I will go.
[11:22:03] <johnbender> :D
[11:22:07] <toddmparker_> serious johnbender - tests all day long
[11:22:08] * johnbender cheers
[11:22:18] <toddmparker_> kin - mind commenting on that pull?
[11:22:23] <johnbender> and feel free to ask about what makes sense to test
[11:22:24] <johnbender> how to test
[11:22:28] <johnbender>  how to use the helpers
[11:22:28] <kinblas> which one?
[11:22:28] <toddmparker_> i don't know if we'd pull this in, even as an extension
[11:22:32] <toddmparker_> right this sec
[11:22:48] <kinblas> toddmparker_: which one? The autodividers?
[11:22:53] <toddmparker_> but if it's pretty light, once we get the builder in place, could be cool
[11:22:57] <toddmparker_> year dividers
[11:23:01] <toddmparker_> i just wanted to see the code
[11:23:09] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so do you want it in?
[11:23:14] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I think we can pull it in and spruce it up
[11:23:15] <kinblas> I guess that's the big decision
[11:23:21] <toddmparker_> but if we have suggestions or ways to make it easier for him, let's do that
[11:23:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's fine
[11:23:33] <johnbender> I have to spruce most pulls
[11:23:33] <toddmparker_> johnbender: how heavy is this ya think?
[11:23:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: heavy in what sense?
[11:23:46] <toddmparker_> if it's small, could be a cool adition
[11:23:48] <toddmparker_> bk
[11:23:50] <toddmparker_> kb
[11:24:04] <johnbender> dunno, I haven't run it through my mental closure-compiler just yet :D
[11:24:10] <toddmparker_> i couldn't tell if this was a lot of code, lots of comments
[11:24:14] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:24:15] <johnbender> I can pull it in and do a size comparison
[11:24:21] <johnbender> comments will be removed
[11:24:24] <toddmparker_> well, if it looks close and it light, we could add it for 1.1
[11:24:27] <toddmparker_> kk
[11:25:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I also have to look at merging gseguin's amd branch
[11:25:06] <toddmparker_> ya
[11:25:11] <johnbender> I think it's pretty ready to go
[11:25:19] <toddmparker_> cool. that is a biggie
[11:25:20] <johnbender> though I feel like he had somethign else he was going to monkey with
[11:25:30] <kinblas> johnbender: toddmparker_: I'lll comment, I have another issue for him/us to think about
[11:25:32] <toddmparker_> he was on earlier...
[11:25:37] <toddmparker_> thanks kin
[11:25:41] <johnbender> kinblas: tanks
[11:26:02] <toddmparker_> i think there is a lot of good stuff in the intel repo
[11:26:12] <toddmparker_> hope to start working with those guys
[11:29:01] <kinblas> grr I hate it when I have 2 things in mind, and then forget the 2nd after describing the details of the 1st ... sigh ... getting old
[11:40:06] <kinblas> toddmparker_: do you remember off the top of your head what platforms don't support dynamic base tag manipulation?
[11:40:59] <kinblas> johnbender: fyi there's a pull request having to do with base tag support ... I'm looking at that and think that our $.support.dynamicBaseTag is broken, and doesn't really test the dynamic part in the case there is an existing base tag ... I have a fix I'm testing
[11:41:21] <johnbender> kinblas: awesomem
[11:41:33] <johnbender> I saw that pr and I was going to ask you to review it anyway
[11:41:39] <johnbender> unless I already did ...
[11:42:01] <johnbender> kinblas: that pr is bad though
[11:42:17] <kinblas> I had asked the guy for clarification and an example of what he was fixing, and saw that he submitted some today
[11:42:24] <johnbender> having totally different types for $.mobile.base is a bade idea
[11:42:39] <kinblas> ??
[11:42:43] <johnbender> kinblas: hmm maybe we're talking about different prs
[11:42:49] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2539
[11:42:50] <kinblas> hang on let me get the url
[11:42:51] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by ArakTaiRoth (2m, 3w ago): rewriteBase
[11:43:11] <johnbender> ah
[11:43:17] <johnbender> ajax and "base" tag
[11:43:46] <johnbender> kinblas: looks like they address the same issue
[11:44:15] <kinblas> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3273/files
[11:44:16] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by jguyomard (4d, 10h ago): Ajax and "base" tag
[11:45:52] <toddmparker_> hmmm, i don't kinblas
[11:45:58] <toddmparker_> maybe email scott?
[11:46:18] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I think it was IE, but I thought there was another, maybe Opera mini?
[11:46:22] <kinblas> I'll have to test
[11:46:35] <toddmparker_> they are out of ajax nav anyway :)
[11:46:38] <toddmparker_> mini
[11:46:58] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah it's mainly to just run a test case to make sure it works properly
[11:47:54] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I basically ripped out the supports test for dynamicBaseTag, rewrote it and inserted into a generic HTML page that tells me the results for the browser it was loaded in
[11:51:07] <toddmparker_> ah
[11:51:17] <toddmparker_> is that for this pull
[12:32:54] <johnbender> gseguin: was there anything pending on the amd branch?
[13:08:44] <gseguin> johnbender: nope
[13:08:51] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[13:08:53] <gseguin> I think it's ready
[13:08:58] <johnbender> hopefully I'll get to that soon
[13:09:27] <gseguin> johnbender: although there is probably another pass to do on the dependencies
[13:10:26] <johnbender> gseguin: yap
[13:11:05] <gseguin> but that is not urgent, for now the (kitchen sink) bundle that's generated has everything in the right order I think
[13:15:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/jS29nQ
[13:15:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] support 1.6.4 to 1.7.0 by defaulting to just props where the mouseHooks haven't been added - John Bender

[13:24:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] adding another role for custom multi select bubble counts - Maurice Gottlieb
[13:30:09] <toddmparker_> cool that landed johnbender
[13:30:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yarp
[13:36:26] <Wilto> Writing baby’s first unit test over here. I assume johnbender will print it, hang it on the fridge—maybe put a gold star “for effort” on there—then promptly rewrite it so it doesn’t suck.
[13:36:45] <johnbender> Wilto: newp
[13:36:54] <Wilto> No star? :(
[13:36:56] <johnbender> Wilto: it'll stay in there so when it breaks you can fix it
[13:37:04] <Wilto> The Enforcer™.
[13:37:04] <johnbender> :D
[13:37:19] <Wilto> Gotta learn sometime, yeah?
[13:37:26] <johnbender> Wilto: yes I imagine that passersby would characterize me as a dick
[13:37:33] <johnbender> Wilto: yah and it's not _that_ bad
[13:38:01] <johnbender> there are some issues with testing js because of the massive amount of external state that the browser represents
[13:38:11] <Wilto> Nah, doesn’t seem too bad at all. I may pester you if I have questions.
[13:38:12] <johnbender> hoping to have time to address that in the near term
[13:38:17] <johnbender> Wilto: feel free
[13:38:23] <johnbender> I'm happy to help
[13:38:25] <Wilto> Thanks holmes.
[13:41:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://gist.github.com/377b23036978f7c7c81b
[13:41:41] <johnbender> looks like it doesn't add much size
[13:41:47] <johnbender> though that output isn't much help
[13:41:48] <johnbender> one sec
[13:42:17] <toddmparker_> looks the same?
[13:42:34] <johnbender> toddmparker_: let me tell you the exact diff
[13:42:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: actually one sec
[13:42:49] <toddmparker_> k
[13:42:50] <johnbender> yours truly is a moron
[13:42:58] <toddmparker_> ^^ i know
[13:43:04] <toddmparker_> BURRRN
[13:44:01] <johnbender> :P
[13:45:20] <johnbender> 			  js/jquery.mobile.listview.autodividers.js \
[13:45:24] <johnbender> arg
[13:45:43] <johnbender> without autodividers 83283
[13:45:51] <johnbender> with 84726
[13:46:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[13:47:28] <toddmparker_> so it adds just a bit then?
[13:47:41] <toddmparker_> is that kb?
[13:47:50] <toddmparker_> 83 vs. 85k?
[13:48:19] <toddmparker_> johnbender ^^
[13:48:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: just about
[13:49:14] <toddmparker_> does that seem huge?
[13:49:22] <toddmparker_> is this the whole lib
[13:49:26] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah
[13:49:27] <toddmparker_> minified?
[13:49:30] <johnbender> pre-gzip
[13:49:33] <johnbender> yap minified
[13:49:37] <toddmparker_> yeah, ok
[13:49:50] <toddmparker_> so minified, it will add even less
[13:49:58] <toddmparker_> let's leave it in then
[13:50:26] <toddmparker_> hopefully, we'll have a simple download builder for 1.1 so people can choose whether they want the feature
[13:50:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that's minified
[13:50:33] <toddmparker_> but it's a nice bit of magic
[13:50:40] <toddmparker_> sorry, gzipped
[13:50:46] <toddmparker_> head fuzzy
[13:50:50] <johnbender> kk
[13:51:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah my next stop is getting amd stuff merged into master so we can start defining the actual dependencies
[13:52:11] <toddmparker_> cool
[14:25:53] <johnbender> kinblas: is binding to "domnodeinserted"
[14:26:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #345: FAILURE in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/345/
[14:26:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> john.m.bender: support 1.6.4 to 1.7.0 by defaulting to just props where the mouseHooks haven't been added
[14:26:29] <Wilto> I DIDN’T DO IT
[14:28:04] <johnbender> that test fails on and off
[14:28:07] <johnbender> :(
[14:28:34] <johnbender> kinblas: is binding to "domnodeinserted" normal, it's deprecated in the dom level 3 spec
[14:30:27] <johnbender> my reasearch also shows that it's not well supported
[14:37:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: the autodividers plugin has an issue of sorts
[14:38:01] <johnbender> it binds to DOMNodeRemoved/DOMNodeInserted to make sure it stays up to date but those events aren't supported by ie and they are deprecated in DOM level 3 (for whatever that's worth)
[14:38:40] <eddiemonge> Wilto: you can practice on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3119
[14:38:46] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (4w, 2d ago): Fix for issue #2308
[14:39:42] <Wilto> Hm, maybe I can grab that tomorrow morning.
[14:54:46] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: commented on the autodividers pr
[14:54:57] <johnbender> there's a blocker / critical issue we need to sort out
[15:09:58] <TehShrike|Work> Is there any documentation on handling device rotation?
[15:12:31] <Wilto> Like http://dev.w3.org/geo/api/spec-source-orientation.html ?
[15:13:14] <TehShrike|Work> Nah, I'm beginning my search for jQuery Mobile documentation on handling portrait mode elegantly, if there is any
[15:14:06] <TehShrike|Work> When my current project is viewed in portrait mode on a 4S, it resizes to be much too wide
[15:14:15] <TehShrike|Work> Err, landscape, rather
[15:14:19] <TehShrike|Work> It looks dandy in Portrait
[15:15:28] <TehShrike|Work> Does the same thing on the iPad, apparently
[15:19:29] <johnbender> Wilto: is the pendulum on your website from chronotrigger?
[15:19:41] <Wilto> Yes indeed it is.
[15:19:56] <johnbender> win
[15:19:57] <Wilto> It’s a good representation of where I’m at professionally.
[15:20:10] <Wilto> “Mostly thinking about sweet SNES games all the time.”
[15:20:22] <Wilto> See also: http://matmarquis.com/zelda/
[15:20:54] <johnbender> nice
[15:21:52] <Wilto> I redid the entire opening of Mega Man 2 once, all the way through to the “boss selected” screen. It was a mess of nested .animate()s, though—not fit for human consumption.
[15:24:21] <Wilto> Some people go outside. I do this.
[15:25:45] <Wilto> TehShrike|Work: That’s probably unrelated to jQM—more likely a matter of your viewport meta tag.
[15:26:23] <TehShrike|Work> Is that tag supposed to be dropped, in order to let jQM do its thing?
[15:26:41] <TehShrike|Work> Or are there still jQM-approved ways of using that?
[15:27:00] <Wilto> You may be seeing something along these lines: http://filamentgroup.com/examples/iosScaleBug/
[15:27:39] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The demo link for our stuff: http://web-ui-fw.github.com/ ... also, where're you guys working on popup? Which branch?
[15:27:40] <TehShrike|Work> I am seeing something exactly along those lines.
[15:28:10] <Wilto> Yeah, not a jQM thing. Like it says, you may have to disable user scaling to prevent that from happening—I would advise against it, however.
[15:28:22] <TehShrike|Work> Well, doing so makes sense in a PhoneGap app, at least
[15:28:31] <TehShrike|Work> But I would like to be internet-compatible, y'know
[15:29:02] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I've added some code to make sure the popup and the screen has a higher z-index than anything else on the page, because I was seeing popups show up behind stuff.

[15:32:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fetchlink] Continued work on fetchlink logic, using “infinite scroll” demo page to test listview enhancement. - Mat Marquis
[15:32:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fetchlink] Namespaced data attributes in fetchlink plugin. - Mat Marquis
[15:33:40] <Wilto> Workin’ on tests; just wanna run some stuff in here past kinblas.
[15:36:00] <TehShrike|Work> Wilto: in your wise and learned opinion, where should one look in order to work around this iOS initial-scale bug (short of setting maximum-scale)?
[15:36:23] <TehShrike|Work> Or is this bug well-enough known that I should just be Googling for people talking about it
[15:36:46] <Wilto> It’s well-known. No real workarounds as yet—there are some JS ones, but they’re all pretty kludgey.
[15:59:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to amd: http://git.io/emPYzw
[15:59:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] fix improperly camel cased module references - John Bender
[16:03:00] <johnbender> gseguin: for the amd branch I'm assuming you didn't give chrome a try?
[16:03:19] <gseguin> I did actually
[16:03:35] <gseguin> johnbender: why?
[16:03:41] <johnbender> gseguin: hrm
[16:03:46] <johnbender> I get a cross origin issue
[16:03:50] <johnbender> what version are you running?
[16:04:11] <johnbender> I'd also like to retract my previous statement "assuming you didn't give chrome a try"
[16:04:14] <johnbender> I sound like an asshole
[16:04:25] <gseguin> are you accessing throught the file:// protocol?
[16:04:31] <johnbender> indeed
[16:04:37] <gseguin> that's why
[16:04:40] <johnbender> right
[16:04:44] <gseguin> you still need an HTTP server
[16:05:19] <johnbender> gseguin: was it the almond branch that let us do the loading without?
[16:05:29] <johnbender> or am I just crazy
[16:05:38] <johnbender> ahh
[16:05:40] <johnbender> nevermind
[16:05:42] <gseguin> in dev mode I don't think either
[16:05:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to fetchlink: http://git.io/uQF2xA
[16:05:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fetchlink] Fixes “infinite scroll” demo by triggering “refresh” on listviews specifically. Should there be a universal “refresh” event? Let us think on this, and discuss. - Mat Marquis
[16:05:58] <johnbender> for some reason I thought "don't need php" === "don't need a webserver"
[16:06:19] <johnbender> gseguin: thanks
[16:06:23] <gseguin> yeah no, or there is something I missed
[16:06:32] <johnbender> nope you're all set
[16:06:36] <johnbender> sorry to trouble you
[16:06:43] <gseguin> no trouble here
[16:06:47] <johnbender> gseguin: also I was caught by a red herring
[16:06:59] <gseguin> wat?
[16:06:59] <johnbender> there were some misnamed module references which caused and error
[16:07:10] <gseguin> oh, oops
[16:07:11] <johnbender> gseguin: so I switch to the file protocol which works for the home page
[16:07:18] <johnbender> after I fixed those
[16:07:26] <johnbender> thinking that I was doing it right
[16:07:30] <johnbender> anyhow
[16:07:39] <gseguin> oh so the X-domain issue is just when you change page
[16:07:42] <gseguin> right?
[16:07:48] <gseguin> that makes sense
[16:07:54] <johnbender> well it borks on the home page but too late to matter visually
[16:08:09] <johnbender> it logs the issue without call the changePage
[16:08:13] <gseguin> I was wondering where RequireJS does xhr, because I thought it was just inserting script tags
[16:08:27] <gseguin> yeah so that has nothing to do with AMD then
[16:09:38] <johnbender> gseguin: I think the same issue still applys to resources
[16:09:56] <johnbender> err
[16:09:58] <johnbender> nevermind
[16:09:58] <gseguin> like?
[16:10:09] <gseguin> k
[16:10:30] <johnbender> gseguin: that's what requirejs as far as I understand
[16:11:32] <johnbender> requirejs *does
[16:11:51] <johnbender> hrm
[16:12:01] <johnbender> now I'm wondering
[16:12:18] <gseguin> wondering what?
[16:12:41] <johnbender> why there's an xhr on the initial page load if require just adds script tags in
[16:14:06] * gseguin looks
[16:14:33] <johnbender> gseguin: according the the dev tools its an options request o.O
[16:15:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't think this is at all important I'm just curious now
[16:16:25] <gseguin> I don't see an xhr in index.html on the root
[16:16:40] <johnbender> gseguin: in the amd branch?
[16:16:52] <gseguin> oh wait
[16:16:52] <johnbender> gseguin: opening from the file protocol?
[16:16:59] <gseguin> oh ok
[16:17:04] <gseguin> lemme try that
[16:17:16] <johnbender> gseguin: sorry I don't mean to take up your time with this I'm just super curious now
[16:17:28] <gseguin> that's ok
[16:18:24] <gseguin> oh I see it now
[16:18:42] <gseguin> I don't think it's requirejs, have you tried the same thing on master
[16:18:43] <gseguin> ?
[16:20:08] <gseguin> I mean, have you tried on master with script tags instead of the combine.php
[16:20:12] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[16:21:00] <gseguin> looks like it's core's business
[16:21:19] <kinblas> johnbender: I just updated https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3273 with a new version of the supports test for dynamicBaseTag support ... I'm wondering how to test it with the unit tests though ... I did test it manually though http://goo.gl/o727s
[16:21:33] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by jguyomard (4d, 14h ago): Ajax and "base" tag
[16:21:48] <kinblas> johnbender: I need to bail for the day so send me any thoughts via email if you can :-)
[16:22:30] <johnbender> gseguin: interesting
[16:22:43] <johnbender> kinblas: will do
[16:37:03] <mikesherov> .
[16:37:34] <mikesherov> Anyone here who could tell me what the minimum iOS version jquerymobile supports is?
[16:38:20] <mikesherov> nvm, I'm an idiot

[19:24:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl pushed 8 new commits to css-fixed: http://git.io/CJe1tA
[19:24:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/css-fixed] patched up support for transition: "none" rather than false, for consistency with other uses of the option in jQM. - scottjehl
[19:24:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/css-fixed] fixed the restorePageZoom method so that it does what it says on the tin. - scottjehl
[19:24:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/css-fixed] changed scrollToggle to hideOnScrollStop, which does just that. It only works if tapToggle is true, so that once hidden, the bar can be toggled visible again with a tap. - scottjehl
