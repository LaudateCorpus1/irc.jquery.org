[08:49:19] <toddparker> good morning all
[08:58:20] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:59:55] <gseguin> toddparker: I saw that the blocker that was assigned to me was fixed by scottjehl (#1507)
[09:00:10] <scottjehl> hey all
[09:00:31] <gseguin> any other issue that I should work on in priority?
[09:00:55] <toddparker> right now, do you have anything tagged to you gseguin?
[09:01:03] <gseguin> yes
[09:01:16] <gseguin> some of them already have pull req for them
[09:01:38] <gseguin> I don't have any more blocker though
[09:03:14] <toddparker> i see that
[09:03:28] <toddparker> most of the blockers for beta 1 are in good shape
[09:03:34] <toddparker> this might be a quick fix: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1762
[09:04:35] <toddparker> scottjehl: did you test this and the onchange seemed to work?
[09:04:37] <toddparker> radio button's onchange event
[09:04:41] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1696
[09:05:02] * gseguin looking into #1762
[09:05:06] <toddparker> ...if not might be a good one for gseguin
[09:05:25] <toddparker> cool
[09:06:02] <scottjehl> hmm. I closed another one recently, related to radio change events
[09:06:08] <scottjehl> maybe it's android specific
[09:06:13] <scottjehl> there's a bitly page to test
[09:08:41] <gseguin> I can take a look after 1762
[09:24:21] <scottjehl> commented on #1696 with a demo page. Works for me
[09:50:43] <toddparker> hey kinblas - how goes it?
[09:51:58] <toddparker> gseguin - i just pulled in 1762 for you. thanks!
[09:52:28] <gseguin> toddparker: you're welcome, that was an easy one
[11:36:14] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[11:36:21] <toddparker> been running tests on your nav branch
[11:36:32] <toddparker> everything looks super...except for WP7
[11:37:04] <toddparker> have you tested in IE7?
[11:37:22] <toddparker> you'll see similar issues there
[11:37:45] <toddparker> you can navigate from the homepage down and back to any of the page there
[11:40:15] <toddparker> but if you try to drill deeper from one of the component list pages (forms, buttons, etc.), you get a 404
[11:40:29] <toddparker> and the home button always points to /docs/ and 404's
[11:42:18] <kinblas> toddparker: ok, on it, I just finished installing a virtual machine so I can install IE7
[11:43:06] <toddparker> cool
[11:43:23] <toddparker> it's probably something relatively small that looks worse than it is
[11:51:53] <toddparker> hey eddiemonge - did you get a chance to look at that docs template?
[12:50:33] <toddparker> kinblas - i realized we're using email instead of IRC...heh
[13:48:43] * kinblas_ grumbles about accidentally blowing away half his site with filezilla
[14:14:58] <toddparker> oh noes
[14:15:28] <toddparker> kinblas, you still in windows update hell?
