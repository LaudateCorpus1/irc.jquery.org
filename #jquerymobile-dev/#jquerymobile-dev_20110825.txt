[06:45:28] <scottjehl> _nickel kinblas morning!
[08:20:39] <gseguin> and ... we're back
[08:32:44] <gseguin> toddparker: Can you take a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2333, I've done a first pass.
[08:32:45] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by wengzhiwen (7h, 41m ago): Some improvements of docs
[08:33:50] <gseguin> toddparker: The thing that I don't like to much is that he removed the <label> here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2333/files#L0L35
[08:33:52] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by wengzhiwen (7h, 42m ago): Some improvements of docs
[08:41:16] <toddparker> Yeah, that's not ok
[08:41:21] <toddparker> you need a label
[08:41:35] <toddparker> a legend in a div makes not sense semanticlaly
[08:41:41] <gseguin> that's what I told him on the previous pull request
[08:42:23] <gseguin> alright I'll put my comment back
[08:43:18] <toddparker> cool
[08:43:21] <toddparker> thanks!
[08:43:27] <gseguin> np
[08:43:37] <gseguin> btw sorry for being unresponsive yesterday
[08:44:14] <gseguin> celebration was going on, here
[08:51:04] <scottjehl> hey gseguin
[08:51:12] <scottjehl> no worries - have fun? :)
[08:51:56] <gseguin> yeah, you may have heard we filed our S1 yesterday
[08:55:14] <gseguin> 'morning kinblas
[08:56:01] <gseguin> we're overdue for a day of hacking
[09:06:05] <scottjehl> gseguin congrats!
[09:06:27] <gseguin> thanks!
[09:36:56] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah we're overdue
[09:37:07] <kinblas> gseguin: congrats?
[09:37:15] * kinblas missed something
[09:37:21] <5EXAACOUF> as did I
[09:37:31] <5EXAACOUF> wtf happened to my nick
[09:37:37] <5EXAACOUF> <-- _nickel
[09:37:37] <kinblas> lol
[09:38:01] <kinblas> _nickel: going for something a little harder to type eh?
[09:38:38] <_nickel> better
[09:38:43] <_nickel> gseguin: what did we miss?
[09:53:46] <scottjehl> _nickel is that your name for the "other" chat rooms?
[09:53:56] <gseguin> _nickel, kinblas: Jive filed their S1 yesterday
[09:54:21] <_nickel> gseguin: whoa nice
[09:54:29] <kinblas> ah yeah
[09:54:32] <_nickel> gseguin: so, you're taking us out for dinner right?
[09:54:39] <kinblas> heh
[09:54:44] <gseguin> heh :)
[09:54:47] <_nickel> me
[09:54:54] * _nickel is joking
[09:55:15] <_nickel> scottjehl: I wonder if they have "other" type chat rooms in irc
[09:58:06] <scottjehl> heh
[10:23:07] <_nickel> scottjehl: kinblas: so I've got a 99% solution to our chrome back button problem
[10:23:25] <_nickel> I solved the history problem
[10:23:30] <_nickel> I solved the transitions problem
[10:23:47] <_nickel> and now all I have to do is sort out how to transition back to the origin page
[10:23:50] <_nickel> and that will be it
[10:23:53] <_nickel> well
[10:23:56] <_nickel> so far as I know
[10:24:08] <scottjehl> yeah?
[10:24:22] <scottjehl> thats great to hear. lots of code to workaround it?
[10:25:04] <_nickel> scottjehl: not really
[10:25:21] <_nickel> scottjehl: I'm using the directHashChange to leverage the history on popstate
[10:25:27] <_nickel> so I'll end up cleaning that up too
[10:29:09] <scottjehl> so we have to change navigation for this?
[10:29:14] <scottjehl> directHashChange?
[10:29:15] <scottjehl> or no
[10:31:02] <_nickel> scottjehl: nope its uses it
[10:31:06] <_nickel> scottjehl: no need to change it
[10:31:13] <scottjehl> coo
[10:31:19] <_nickel> scottjehl: well thats not entirely true
[10:31:34] <_nickel> scottjehl: but nothing that changes how vanilla nav works
[10:31:39] <_nickel> and its like two variables
[10:31:56] <_nickel> once I get it working all together I'll push to a personal branch and you guys can take a look
[10:33:29] <scottjehl> no need for personal branch
[10:33:37] <scottjehl> sounds good looking forward to it
[10:35:55] <_nickel> scottjehl: this is actually a better solution than running it back trhough the hashchange on popstate
[10:35:59] <_nickel> its much more explicit
[10:36:19] <_nickel> it reads "on popstate, change to this page"
[10:36:23] <_nickel> and less flashing
[10:36:27] <_nickel> yay!
[10:36:38] <_nickel> kinblas gets the credit though for pushing me to do it
[10:37:03] <_nickel> solving the chrome forward button issue is a nice side effect
[10:38:03] <kinblas> werd
[10:38:43] <kinblas> scottjehl: you have time to walk me through some transition changes you made back in june?
[10:38:55] <kinblas> Just curious why there is code to set the page heights?
[10:40:03] <scottjehl> it keeps the address bar a) hidden and b) overlapping when it is hidden across all platforms
[10:40:09] <scottjehl> and orientations
[10:40:24] <scottjehl> b) overlapping when it is shown briefly across all platforms
[10:40:27] <scottjehl> sorry
[10:40:55] <scottjehl> it prevents a whole extra down-up in the transitions when the bar pushes everything down, feels more seemless
[10:41:15] <scottjehl> if we only had iPhone to worry about, we might set min-height to 480px in the css and that's that
[10:41:20] <scottjehl> more complicated though
[10:41:41] <scottjehl> I'll be on later guys, sorry I have to run to a meeting!
[10:42:05] <kinblas> scottjehl: can you ping me when you get back
[10:42:13] <scottjehl> sure I'll sign on later
[10:42:34] <scottjehl> open to other ideas too - this was just the way I could solve it back then
[10:42:38] <scottjehl> later!
[11:01:14] <toddparker> hi guys
[11:01:18] <toddparker> meeting time!
[11:53:00] <_nickel> toddparker: kinblas: is it alright if I start this merge when I get back from lunch?
[11:53:29] <kinblas> _nickel: this is a matter of life or death, your stomach can wait!
[11:53:36] <kinblas> _nickel: go to lunch
[11:53:38] <kinblas> :-)
[11:53:39] <_nickel> I'll take that as a yes :D
[11:53:52] <kinblas> heh
[11:54:06] <kinblas> I have to grab a bit too before my next meeting
[12:01:33] * gseguin tamed MacIrssi
[12:04:02] <gseguin> So any taker on that jQM book autoring for packt pub ?
[12:04:19] <gseguin> *authoring
[12:12:51] <toddparker> if you guys don't want to write a whole book, that guy Eric Sarrion sent me some new chapters.
[12:13:05] <toddparker> you could be tech editors or even co-authors
[12:13:12] <toddparker> it would be a free PDF
[12:13:21] <toddparker> totally up to you
[12:13:39] <toddparker> i can forward if you want to see if the chapters are worth revising?
[12:15:35] <gseguin> toddparker: I can take a look
[12:16:33] <toddparker> i just forwarded a few chapters to you guys
[12:16:41] <gseguin> thanks
[12:17:10] <toddparker> so the format of these is the basic word template for authros
[12:17:16] <toddparker> it would be cleaned up visually too
[12:17:29] <toddparker> so he offered to donate the whole book to the proect
[12:17:34] <toddparker> it's about 500 pages
[12:59:56] <rwaldron> hey guys quick support question if anyone has a moment?
[13:03:51] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: kinblas: gseguin: the merge, I begin it
[13:04:46] <gseguin> rwaldron: shoot
[13:06:18] <rwaldron> word
[13:06:54] <rwaldron> wondering if there is a "backdoor" way to stop anchors in header/footer roles from being styled at all
[13:07:12] <rwaldron> i have custom icons from an iOS app that the client wants
[13:07:25] <rwaldron> and I've been trying to slowly peel away all the "stuff"
[13:07:47] * gseguin looks
[13:08:00] <rwaldron> the theme system is not going work for this either
[13:08:07] <rwaldron> i tried setting them up as theme icons
[13:08:29] <rwaldron> i jsut need to be able to build the styles myself without fighting jquery mobile
[13:11:50] <kinblas> I thought we left anchors in header/footer alone
[13:12:18] <kinblas> gseguin: you want to look in page.sections.js
[13:12:33] <gseguin> kinblas: that's where I was looking
[13:12:43] <gseguin> but I don't see a way around it though
[13:13:13] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: kinblas: gseguin: replacestate landed
[13:13:18] <_nickel> toddparker: going to work on the docs now
[13:13:18] <gseguin> oh yeah you're right
[13:13:42] <gseguin> w00t! _nickel!
[13:13:44] <kinblas> rwaldron: are you referring to the ui-btn-left/right that is added?
[13:14:10] <rwaldron> nope
[13:14:22] <rwaldron> so, in a data-role="footer" div
[13:14:32] <rwaldron> if i add <a href=""> whatever
[13:14:39] <rwaldron> it gets turned into a button
[13:14:42] <gseguin> it'll become a button
[13:14:44] <gseguin> yep
[13:14:45] <rwaldron> yep
[13:14:56] <rwaldron> i'm wondering if there is a way to short that
[13:15:06] <rwaldron> if not, i'll figure something out
[13:15:28] <rwaldron> but i figured if anyone would kknow, it's you guys
[13:15:45] <gseguin> I have to look
[13:15:50] <kinblas> rwaldron: and you aren't using a navbar right?
[13:15:54] <gseguin> it's not where I thought it would be
[13:15:59] <rwaldron> nope
[13:16:24] <rwaldron> 'll be right back
[13:20:34] <rwaldron> i think i might have an idea
[13:20:44] <rwaldron> to jsut create a theme with no style
[13:25:36] * gseguin debugs
[13:26:37] <kinblas> It happens in the buttonMarkup pagecreate handler
[13:26:47] <kinblas> the selectors used to find anchors in the docs is hardcoded
[13:26:56] <kinblas> but I see .ui-header > a in there
[13:27:13] <kinblas> rwaldron: so one workaround would be to put your content one level down
[13:27:24] <kinblas> that is, wrap your footer content with some other div
[13:27:47] <rwaldron> ohhh.. hm.
[13:28:03] <rwaldron> that might be easier then what I'm doing now
[13:28:07] <kinblas> now that I see that code, I remember scott/todd mentioning that in a talk of theirs, which i then regurgitated in a talk of my own
[13:28:15] <rwaldron> gotcha
[13:28:26] <gseguin> kinblas: it's in buttonMarkup
[13:28:58] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah I found it ... read up ^^^
[13:29:07] <gseguin> oops
[13:29:13] <gseguin> oh sorry
[13:29:23] <kinblas> gseguin: all that code used to be in page.js
[13:29:29] <kinblas> but since the decoupling
[13:29:36] <gseguin> yep
[13:29:39] <kinblas> I have yet to familiarize myself with where everything went
[13:30:09] <rwaldron> nice, this looks good
[13:30:10] <rwaldron> thanks
[13:30:16] <rwaldron> thats the jam i was looking for
[13:30:28] <rwaldron> wrap with div, do whatever you want
[13:30:34] <kinblas> yup yup
[13:30:39] <rwaldron> thanks guys
[13:30:48] * kinblas tips his virtual hat
[13:30:49] <rwaldron> i really appreciate the advice
[13:31:03] <kinblas> anytime
[13:31:09] <rwaldron> conf beers!
[13:31:22] <gseguin> rwaldron: or you can put a data-role="none
[13:31:24] <gseguin> "
[13:31:28] <kinblas> at least that was an easy one ... we still have to figure out that other problem you had which I couldn't repro
[13:31:29] <gseguin> on your <a>
[13:31:42] <rwaldron> kinblas ohhh wait
[13:31:52] <rwaldron> that weird one where pages were offset?
[13:31:59] <kinblas> yeah
[13:32:01] <kinblas> I couldn't repro
[13:32:03] <rwaldron> i think i actually solved that on accident
[13:32:08] <kinblas> that one where you posted the screen shots
[13:32:10] <rwaldron> here's what was causing it
[13:32:27] <rwaldron> i create pages on the fly... first the data-role="page"
[13:32:27] <kinblas> rwaldron: if you could update the bug with details that would be awesome :-)
[13:32:40] <rwaldron> oh sure
[13:32:43] <rwaldron> totally forgot about that
[13:32:46] <rwaldron> sorry :(
[13:32:48] <kinblas> but I'm willing to listen ;-)
[13:32:54] <rwaldron> wel, its simple
[13:33:18] <rwaldron> i think it's a combo of fixed toolbars and the page being created with no content
[13:33:38] <rwaldron> as in, the content wasn't loaded until later
[13:33:43] <rwaldron> now  load it in slightly earlier
[13:33:47] <rwaldron> and it's fine
[13:33:58] <toddparker> WOO HOO!
[13:34:02] <toddparker> awesome _nicke
[13:34:15] <toddparker> just got out of a meeting and pushstate is a GO
[13:34:20] <toddparker> great work you guys
[13:34:30] <kinblas> rwaldron: ok thanks for the info.
[13:34:38] <kinblas> toddparker: do you guys have a Xoom?
[13:34:56] <rwaldron> kinblas closing: "The cause was unrelated to jQuery Mobile"
[13:35:03] <toddparker> rwaltron - the suggestion above to add a data-role="none" on those header links is the way to go
[13:35:18] <toddparker> or, if you wrap them in a container, the framework leave 'em alone
[13:35:35] <toddparker> we just got a xoom
[13:35:39] <rwaldron> toddparker thanks, i'll try that as well
[13:35:40] <toddparker> ^^kinblas
[13:35:48] <gseguin> kinblas: we have one as well
[13:35:48] <toddparker> thing is chunky
[13:35:54] <kinblas> yeah heavy
[13:36:04] <kinblas> I have an url for you to check out if yo uhave a couple of minutes
[13:36:10] <gseguin> sure
[13:36:11] <toddparker> the only thing lighter than an ipad is the galaxy tab
[13:36:15] <toddparker> that is pretty nice
[13:36:21] <toddparker> ok, shoot
[13:36:23] <_nickel> toddparker: hmm scott's ?? looked ominous in that email he sent
[13:36:26] <toddparker> in the xoom?
[13:36:59] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah
[13:37:02] <kinblas> toddparker: http://bit.ly/nD0ZKJ
[13:37:14] <toddparker> i don't think scottjehl was being all omninous, just incredulous
[13:37:18] <kinblas> that page is a snapshot of the markup generated for the transitions page
[13:37:21] <toddparker> that URL is too short
[13:37:30] <toddparker> embiggen it plz
[13:37:37] <kinblas> lol
[13:37:46] * gseguin is waiting for that thing to boot up
[13:37:56] <gseguin> lol
[13:38:00] <kinblas> toddparker: anyways, the slideup and slidedown are optimized
[13:38:11] <kinblas> ... btw, it's a one shot deal, you transition, you have to reload the page
[13:38:30] <kinblas> toddparker: I just wanted to show you that we can get it to not flicker/blink at all
[13:38:42] <kinblas> when JQM JS isn't involved
[13:38:54] <kinblas> so I'm just trying to figure out what things are causing the extra work.
[13:39:22] <kinblas> the sample page uses the entire CSS from JQM so we're doing something in JS to cause that extra flicker
[13:39:49] <toddparker> ah, i was just going to say nav is busted
[13:40:01] <toddparker> i have a software update pending for this.
[13:40:07] <toddparker> i'll test now, then after updating
[13:40:09] <gseguin> alright my Xoom is dead
[13:40:15] <kinblas> does it flash when you slideup/slidedown?
[13:40:17] <gseguin> :(
[13:40:29] <kinblas> gseguin: eh? needs charge?
[13:40:42] <gseguin> even plugged in it's not booting up
[13:41:17] <kinblas> doh
[13:41:34] <toddparker> no blink
[13:41:38] <_nickel> gseguin: if its super drained sometimes it requires a bit of charging
[13:41:41] <kinblas> gseguin: some devices require a minimal charge on the abattery
[13:41:48] <_nickel> gseguin: ^
[13:41:54] * kinblas notes _nickel beat him
[13:42:07] * _nickel can die a happy man
[13:42:12] <kinblas> lol
[13:42:37] <kinblas> toddparker: I lengthened the transition time on the sample, but its the same if I shorten it
[13:42:41] <kinblas> smooth as silk
[13:42:52] <gseguin> I think what happened is that I thought I was charging it with a micro usb
[13:43:15] <kinblas> it doesn't charge off that port does it?
[13:43:21] <gseguin> but it actually takes a special cable to charge it
[13:43:25] <kinblas> right
[13:43:35] <kinblas> their charge tip is like a needle
[13:43:52] <kinblas> they should've done micro usb
[13:43:58] <kinblas> like all their other devices
[13:44:02] <gseguin> yep, very stupid of them
[13:51:47] <toddparker> kinblas - sorrry
[13:52:07] <toddparker> there is a pause/hiccup at about 20% in, then is goes smoothly
[13:52:18] <kinblas> toddparker: heh, I'm futzing with it
[13:52:24] <kinblas> toddparker: let me undo
[13:52:29] <toddparker> i didn't know that about the charging
[13:52:30] <kinblas> hang on a sec
[13:52:35] <toddparker> k
[13:53:58] <kinblas> toddparker: ok, I reset things ... you should only look at slideup/slidedown in that page, everything else is still blinky
[13:55:04] <kinblas> toddparker: Oh I think I see the hesitation you're talking about ... but that is the browser animation code, we cant control that, but what we don't want is the flashing/blink
[14:03:16] <toddparker> sure
[14:03:59] <toddparker> just re-tested
[14:04:02] <toddparker> like butta
[14:04:09] <toddparker> with a hiccup
[14:11:44] <kinblas> toddparker: what was the hiccup? just the hesitation in the beginning?
[14:11:54] <kinblas> or did you mean there was a blink
[14:15:19] <toddparker> just the hesitation
[14:15:22] <toddparker> looks good
[14:22:25] <kinblas> _nickel: are folks still getting build updates via email?
[14:22:32] <_nickel> kinblas: indeed
[14:22:37] <kinblas> _nickel: I'm curious because I'm not getting them anymore
[14:22:41] <_nickel> kinblas: :(
[14:22:46] <_nickel> let me go see if I can fix that
[14:22:50] <kinblas> maybe they are mad at me?
[14:22:50] <toddparker> i get 'em
[14:22:51] <kinblas> :-P
[14:23:13] <_nickel> kinblas: jblas@adobe.com
[14:23:16] <_nickel> its in there
[14:23:26] <kinblas> hmmm perhaps spam filter is catching it now.
[14:23:29] * kinblas checks
[14:24:45] <kinblas> hmmm nothin' but viagra, cialis, and watch emails
[14:25:12] <kinblas> but I do see an exchange between scott and john over the Blog thread ... not sure why the spam filter is flagging you guys now.
[14:25:51] <toddparker> we are kind spammy
[14:26:56] <toddparker> Vi4gra 4 SALE! 80% OFF
[14:27:14] <toddparker> Your PayPal accoutn has been compromised. Log in here.
[14:28:14] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: _nickel: so if it seems like I haven't responded to any of your emails, it seems I haven't gotten them ... I'm trolling through the spam filter right now
[14:33:27] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: _nickel: just caught uup on the blog emails ... I'm fine with the handlers ... maybe I'll be able to bump by tweet count up from 5 :-P
[14:33:44] <_nickel> kinblas: :D
[14:48:57] <toddparker> nice
[14:49:22] <toddparker> btw - i just emailed laurent from rim to try and get his team helping us work on transitions
[14:49:44] <toddparker> it's been very helpful having the opera people looking at this so RIM woudl be a logical addition
[14:49:47] <toddparker> they are fired up too
[14:50:21] <toddparker> i hope scottjehl can cook up a cool ios5 demo with the overflow to show the diff. with transitions and fixed headers footers
[14:50:31] <toddparker> if rim jumps on board too, that will be a big win
[15:29:39] <_nickel> toddparker: question
[15:29:56] <_nickel> toddparker: do we have a "NEW" tag/markup for additions to the api docs?
[15:30:02] <_nickel> I'm working on the docs now
[16:17:54] <scottjehl> annnnd back
[16:18:10] <scottjehl> _nickel toddparker kinblas gseguin woo!!!
[16:18:18] <_nickel> scottjehl: :D
[16:18:27] <_nickel> scottjehl: working on the docs for replaceState now
[16:18:32] <gseguin> :)
[16:18:34] <scottjehl> people seem psyched on twitter
[16:18:35] <_nickel> I'll probably have to finish tommorrow
[16:18:40] <scottjehl> excellent
[16:18:43] <scottjehl> there are docs?
[16:18:49] <_nickel> scottjehl: there will be :D
[16:18:52] <scottjehl> or just explanation
[16:18:58] <_nickel> I'm doing a little rearrange of the nav/hash docs
[16:19:03] <scottjehl> I mean, not so much API stuff right?
[16:19:06] <_nickel> no
[16:19:12] <_nickel> just and explanation of wtf is happening to the url lol
[16:19:22] <scottjehl> just like, whoa this is some sorta wizardry wtf
[16:19:22] <_nickel> since its just a crazy juggle
[16:19:46] <scottjehl> hey man, we're here to try and solve hard problems. nice work :)
[16:20:15] <_nickel> scottjehl: you had the idea I just fixed the tests lol
[16:20:30] <gseguin> great work guys!
[16:20:32] <scottjehl> teamwork fellas.
[16:20:45] <scottjehl> I'm just psyched we don't leave a trail now
[16:21:26] <_nickel> scottjehl: yep we sneak in, steal their wifes (or husbands as the case may be) and leave without a trace
[16:22:04] <_nickel> I'll take the wives if its all the same to you guys though :D
[16:22:22] <kinblas> lol
[16:22:23] <_nickel> scottjehl: where can I see people being excited about this :D
[16:22:24] <scottjehl> you can add this script to the average website and turn it into a single-page app, with all the benefits of not having to re-execute scripts, re-render stylesheets, make new requests, etc each page load. That's what I call mobile optimization
[16:22:25] <gseguin> lol
[16:22:56] <scottjehl> where's my wife?
[16:23:45] <gseguin> in chrome the url changes twice, right, that's the workaround for that chrome bug
[16:23:49] <gseguin> ?
[16:24:02] <_nickel> gseguin: thats the default behaviour
[16:24:13] <gseguin> ok
[16:24:14] <_nickel> thats the workaround for ios4 pushstate :(
[16:24:25] <gseguin> oh ok
[16:24:28] <scottjehl> hashchange, then cleanup
[16:24:34] <_nickel> the fix for the chromebug will reduce the number of url changes when using the back and forward buttons thuogh
[16:24:52] <scottjehl> oh nice. so _nickel are you gonna get that change in?
[16:25:01] <_nickel> scottjehl: thats tomorrow after I finish the docs
[16:25:03] <scottjehl> I wasn't clear
[16:25:05] <scottjehl> ok
[16:25:07] <_nickel> scottjehl: still a couple things to sort out
[16:25:18] <_nickel> but its working for the most part
[16:25:49] <_nickel> scottjehl: its basically a subset of our hashchange handler because the popstate just handles forward and back
[16:25:52] <_nickel> whatever
[16:25:53] <_nickel> I'll show you
[16:26:09] <scottjehl> I'll have time to take a look at it tomorrow
[16:26:14] <scottjehl> sounds good tho
[16:30:55] <_nickel> scottjehl: that wild croatia gif is amazing my wife will love that (whole family is hrvatski)
[16:31:02] <_nickel> toddparker: ^
[16:32:15] <_nickel> alright I'm headed home,
[16:32:29] <_nickel> I'll finish up the docs tomorrow and try to wrap up the chrome fix before the weekend
[16:32:36] <_nickel> unless there are other priorities
[16:42:52] <scottjehl> is this a real issue on our CDN or? https://twitter.com/stowball/status/106873375116365824
[16:42:53] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from stowball: WTF? You can't use the @jquery CDN in https? Well that ruins trying to minimise the impact of  @jquerymobile ★ http://bit.ly/ni5PdV
[16:46:21] <kinblas> scottjehl: Is the problem that the ssl cert is not trusted?
[16:46:42] <kinblas> if you try to load https://code.jquery.com directly I get an untrusted message
[16:50:55] <scottjehl> hmm but it loa
[16:50:57] <scottjehl> hmm
[16:51:37] <scottjehl> I thought the workaround here was to use a protocol-relative path, but then I guess if the cdn returns that message, that won't help anyway huh?
