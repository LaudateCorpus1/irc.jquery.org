[07:52:14] <gseguin> mornin'
[07:56:36] <gnarf> mornins
[07:56:43] <gnarf> getting on a plane soon
[07:56:59] <gnarf> if you end up with questions RE znc gseguin, ask ryanneufeld or ajpiano
[07:57:28] <gseguin> alright will do. Thanks for your help gnarf
[08:38:42] <Wilto> Red Leader, reporting in.
[08:44:06] <RWhitbeck> Lock S-foils in attack position!
[09:01:54] <Wilto> That’s what I’m talkin’ about, RWhitbeck.
[09:02:49] <Wilto> kinblas!
[09:02:56] <Wilto> ARE YOU BACK FOREVER YET
[09:03:15] <kinblas> Wilto: lol
[09:28:03] <toddmparker_> hey foolz
[09:28:15] <gseguin> hey toddmparker_
[09:28:24] <toddmparker_> KINBLAS? Did I stumble into a time machine...again?
[09:28:35] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin - how was the flight back?
[09:28:45] <toddmparker_> anyone know if danheberden caught his plane?
[09:28:46] <gseguin> trying out that ZNC thingy, pretty dope!
[09:28:56] <gseguin> flight was good
[09:28:59] <toddmparker_> guessing not. that airport...sheesh
[09:29:07] <gseguin> 20min early
[09:29:13] <toddmparker_> ZNC? Screen sharing?
[09:29:18] <gseguin> yeah IAD sucks big time
[09:29:29] <gseguin> nope IRC bouncer
[09:29:32] <toddmparker_> or is that the history bot thing?
[09:29:39] <toddmparker_> ah, i need to set that up
[09:29:45] <gseguin> it's like your own irccloud
[09:29:52] <toddmparker_> yeah, i like that idea
[09:29:53] <gseguin> with a native client
[09:30:39] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: VNC is screen sharing, ZNC is the server gnarf set up so that you can stay logged into the IRC channels
[09:30:55] <toddmparker_> ah. computers are hard.
[09:31:03] <ryanneufeld> iknowrite
[09:31:19] <toddmparker_> can I set this up on my AOL Buddy Chat?
[09:31:27] <toddmparker_> Y/N?
[09:31:45] <ryanneufeld> NO http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/232/114/e39.png
[09:31:59] <ryanneufeld> unless AOL Buddy chat supports IRC
[09:32:01] <ryanneufeld> then yes
[09:32:02] <ryanneufeld> :)
[09:32:29] <toddmparker_> brb, calling customer support
[09:32:47] <ryanneufeld> you need to use the keyword IRC
[09:33:26] <toddmparker_> aaah, right!Is that in the google or the explorer?
[09:34:04] <ryanneufeld> http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/masonry/000/259/943/694.png
[09:34:15] <ryanneufeld> lol
[09:34:32] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: lemme or gnarf know if you want an account on the ZNC server and we'll get you sorted
[09:34:34] <toddmparker_> man, tough room.
[09:34:41] <toddmparker_> i do
[09:34:45] <ryanneufeld> k
[09:34:49] <toddmparker_> i might need some IRC sorting first
[09:35:24] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: you want toddmparker or toddmparker_ ?
[09:35:41] <ryanneufeld> I was personally tempted to go with ZeroCool
[09:35:47] <ryanneufeld> or CrashOverride
[09:45:06] <RWhitbeck> toddmparker_: No danheberden missed his flight.  He caught another flight through SFO though.  He's home now.
[09:52:32] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: arschmitz_: I'm here
[09:52:42] <ryanneufeld> hey johnbender
[09:53:08] <ryanneufeld> I wanted to pick your brain a bit, I am thinking about doing a preso at the portland conf
[09:53:25] <ryanneufeld> on vagrant
[09:53:31] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: yah I saw that in the conf notes
[09:53:35] <johnbender> pick away
[09:54:10] <ryanneufeld> well, I'm not sure how to approach it
[09:54:30] <ryanneufeld> I've not done a preso before, and i'm not sure what is a good way to present it
[09:54:59] <ryanneufeld> since a lot of people there might not even be worried about server side stuff
[10:01:30] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: so that's the key
[10:01:36] <johnbender> imo
[10:01:43] <johnbender> you have to make it a real concern for people
[10:01:48] <johnbender> otherwise you'll loose them
[10:01:57] <ryanneufeld> Yeah
[10:02:06] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: CAVEAT -> I'm not the worlds greatest presenter
[10:02:17] <ryanneufeld> no one is
[10:02:36] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: so you've got a tough, but no impossible job
[10:02:41] <johnbender> *not
[10:02:46] <ryanneufeld> I think what i'll do is put together my preso, and show it at work
[10:02:53] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: yes
[10:02:58] <ryanneufeld> get feedback, and then maybe a skype call w/ some jquery peeps
[10:03:02] <johnbender> definitely give it to as many people as possible
[10:03:04] <ryanneufeld> get moar feedback
[10:03:16] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: are there local meetups you can speak at?
[10:03:22] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[10:03:24] <ryanneufeld> there are
[10:03:29] <johnbender> do all of them
[10:03:35] <ryanneufeld> could do
[10:03:37] <johnbender> I _love_ doing local meetups for new presos
[10:03:57] <johnbender> people are generally much more tollerant and it's a great way to get a feel for the flow of your presentation
[10:04:14] <johnbender> you get a sense for whether you're building out the idea (telling the story) that you want to
[10:06:22] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[10:06:48] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: as far as the content is concerened there's a lot you can do to appeal to js devs because almost _all_ of them are working on projects that have servers
[10:06:56] <johnbender> and many many more of them are _not_ working on the backend
[10:07:08] <johnbender> that is, many are purely front end
[10:07:14] <johnbender> which is a great use case for Vagrant
[10:07:38] <johnbender> designer: "How do I setup the project so I can alter the stylesheets?"  dev: "fml"
[10:07:39] <ryanneufeld> yes
[10:07:47] <ryanneufeld> OMFG
[10:07:59] <ryanneufeld> I have that exact convo every time!
[10:08:04] <ryanneufeld> *sigh*
[10:08:10] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: one thing you could do is to enumerate those use cases
[10:08:29] <ryanneufeld> Yeah, I think I want to have some sample configs in a github repo
[10:08:46] <ryanneufeld> so that people can download and get running asap
[10:12:12] <ryanneufeld> ?tell toddmparker_ did you get the pms? And if so did you have any trouble getting it set up?
[10:12:12] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Okay.
[10:13:08] <agcolom> Hi all! Back in London!
[10:13:36] <RWhitbeck> hey agcolom did they have a meal  on the flight? or did you starve?
[10:14:26] <gseguin> hey agcolom!
[10:15:08] <agcolom> hey! I had chicken curry!
[10:15:15] <agcolom> (on the flight)
[10:16:25] <RWhitbeck> oh nice
[10:16:33] <agcolom> gseguin: so you got back ok as well?
[10:16:40] <RWhitbeck> I bet everyone loved the smell of that on the plane ;)
[10:17:06] <agcolom> RWhitbeck: yes I was rather surprised!
[10:17:10] <gseguin> agcolom: yeah was 25 min early
[10:17:20] <agcolom> gseguin: Cool!
[10:19:36] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: thoughts https://gist.github.com/f32f1020ed4a08770e02
[10:19:56] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: <3
[10:20:44] <RWhitbeck> this chat room is much more interesting now that I know everyone :P
[10:24:35] <arschmitz_> johnbender: Hi just got back was at an ultra sound with my wife.
[10:24:41] <arschmitz_> It's a BOY!!
[10:24:48] <arschmitz_> sorry just had to get that out lol
[10:25:05] <gseguin> congrats arschmitz_!
[10:25:15] <arschmitz_> Thank you!
[10:34:39] <gnarf> gseguin: i see you using two clients - you might want to turn on "keep buffer" in the settings which will always replay the last buffer lines when you reconnect, even if there is another client that has already received them
[10:35:23] <johnbender> arschmitz_: YAR!
[10:35:25] <johnbender>  congrats guy
[10:35:35] <arschmitz_> Thanks!
[10:36:26] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: if you want to go crazy you could do like stick drawings of the story's
[10:36:36] <johnbender> just make sure to use a picture of a hipster for the designer
[10:36:37] <johnbender> one sec
[10:36:57] <ryanneufeld> lols
[10:37:20] <gseguin> gnarf: yep I enabled it
[10:37:23] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: http://i.qkme.me/3ra4wv.jpg
[10:37:34] <ryanneufeld> ROFL
[10:38:07] <ryanneufeld> I was thinking this http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_-JM9yC9uhUw/SZoRhZmspZI/AAAAAAAAAXw/5yHXf9cyvog/s400/hipster1.jpg
[10:50:51] <arschmitz_> johnbender: im working on a workaround for a couple ios fixed position bugs i found and i was hoping you could take a look and see if you think im on the right track with my fixes.
[10:52:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to simple-nav: http://git.io/5Cn2ww
[10:52:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/simple-nav] provide history and directionality to popstate based navigate event - John Bender
[11:02:49] <toddmparker_> ryanneufeld: sorry. toddmparker please
[11:02:50] <bot-t> (50 mins 30 secs ago) <ryanneufeld> tell toddmparker_ did you get the pms? And if so did you have any trouble getting it set up?
[11:04:22] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: ^^ ?
[11:04:46] <toddmparker_> congrats arschmitz_
[11:05:02] <arschmitz_> toddmparker: Thank you
[11:05:35] <toddmparker_> ryanneufeld: err, "pms"?
[11:06:32] <RWhitbeck> toddmparker_ I know what he's talking about…you were so moody this week.
[11:07:02] <johnbender> arschmitz_: sure, link?
[11:07:23] <arschmitz_> johnbender: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/236/edit
[11:07:55] <arschmitz_> im not really happy with the ios6 fix at all but i think i may have a different idea for that
[11:08:19] <johnbender> arschmitz_: how many fixes are there?
[11:08:25] <johnbender> two I guess?
[11:08:38] <arschmitz_> yeah
[11:08:46] <arschmitz_> one for ios5 and one for ios6
[11:08:48] <johnbender> arschmitz_: yah that ios6 one sounds like a punt tbh
[11:09:04] <arschmitz_> it works but its terrible
[11:09:11] <johnbender> arschmitz_: not the fix, but just fixing the bug
[11:09:16] <arschmitz_> oh
[11:09:24] <johnbender> keyboard bugs are just tough
[11:09:29] <johnbender> arschmitz_: always worth trying though
[11:10:18] <arschmitz_> johnbender: yeah i can fix the bug in both but the solution for ios6 involves having to track the position of every input or textarea! not exactly ideal
[11:13:39] <arschmitz_> oh i sent wrong link should have been http://jsbin.com/uzaret/238/edit
[11:13:50] <arschmitz_> the ios6 solution on that is completely different
[11:21:47] <johnbender> arschmitz_: yah I would punt on that
[11:22:17] <arschmitz_> im not sure what you mean by punt lol?
[11:23:48] <johnbender> arschmitz_: I wouldn't put that solution into the library as a bug fix
[11:23:53] <johnbender> :)
[11:24:11] <johnbender> gimme a second to parse the ios5 fix
[11:24:12] <arschmitz_> either one or just the ios6 one?
[11:25:29] <johnbender> just the ios6 one
[11:25:40] <arschmitz_> johnbender: the ios 5 problem is kinda a bigger one as it will kill fixed toolbars when you follow a link to an #id like your working on in the new nav
[11:25:42] <johnbender> the description of the ios5 fix seems fairly reasonable
[11:26:56] <arschmitz_> i wasent happy with the ios6 fix anyway i was hoping that one you might have some insight as to another direction.
[11:27:34] <johnbender> arschmitz_: I've given to throwing my hands up with keyboard based bugs
[11:27:49] <johnbender> it's such an "external" bit of the browser
[11:27:59] <johnbender> arschmitz_: maybe Wilto_ or toddmparker have some ideas
[11:28:31] <arschmitz_> johnbender:i have a clean solution for ios6 on the inital pop but if they scroll with the keyboard open it dosent work and repositions them crazy
[11:28:36] <ryanneufeld> Testing message for toddmparker_
[11:28:46] <Wilto> Sorry, wasn’t feeling like myself yuk yuk yuk wokka wokka /nick jokes.
[11:29:22] <Wilto> What’s up?
[11:30:08] <johnbender> arschmitz_: so it makes it worse on scroll with the keyboard up? or it's an improvement for the initial pop and then all other cases are the same amount of badness :)
[11:31:05] <arschmitz_> johnbender: the inital pop is perfect. after that when they scroll its on average better but could go worse.
[11:31:24] <arschmitz_> depends on if they scroll up or down and how much
[11:31:51] <Wilto> We should just make it so users can’t scroll up.
[11:32:00] <Wilto> Just reload the page to get back to the top.
[11:32:02] <Wilto> ?CC
[11:32:02] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[11:33:01] <ryanneufeld> I love that bot
[11:33:08] <ryanneufeld> ?botsnack
[11:33:09] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[11:33:29] <johnbender> arschmitz_: keep that one in your back pocket IMO, but the ios5 thing seems worth trying out in the library
[11:34:10] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: shoudl see this
[11:34:20] <ryanneufeld> to fast!
[11:34:47] <Wilto> Man, busy in here today. Catching up.
[11:35:21] <arschmitz_> yeah that one seemed good ill put together an actual fix for it in the fixedtoolbar widget and do a pull request for it.
[11:35:21] <ryanneufeld> I'm trying to get toddmparker setup on the znc
[11:36:10] <Wilto> ZNC—that’s the blue stuff that lifeguards would wear on their noses back in the 90s, yeah?
[11:36:11] <ryanneufeld> a message that todd should see
[11:36:18] <ryanneufeld> another one that he should see
[11:36:28] <Wilto> You wanna hook me up with a ZNC account too, while you’re in thurr?
[11:36:30] <arschmitz_> johnbender: i think i might have an idea for ios thats good on pop and same the rest of the time working on it now to see if it works
[11:36:39] <Wilto> I wonder if that’d play well with IRCCloud. Maybe I don’t need one.
[11:37:00] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: it would obviate irccloud
[11:37:16] <Wilto> easy words, ryanneufeld, easy words
[11:37:20] <Wilto> i never learnt books good
[11:37:34] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: it would make irccloud less gooder
[11:37:44] <Wilto> Whew, there we go.
[11:37:58] <Wilto> Yeah; better to have it than not, I figure. Mind hookin’ it up?
[11:38:00] <ryanneufeld> Wilto took too many jabs from ajpiano
[11:38:05] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[11:38:13] <Wilto> He’s too strong. Too strong.
[11:41:00] <Wilto> Floating like so many butterflies, stinging like so many bees.
[11:41:40] <Wilto> toddmparker, toddmparker, toddmparker_, toddparker: Oh, hey Todd.
[11:41:50] <toddmparker> i am MANY
[11:42:08] <toddmparker> sorry, logged in multiple ways
[11:42:14] <toddmparker> working on ZNC setup
[11:43:22] <ryanneufeld> and it's working!
[12:05:29] <toddmparker> This thing on?
[12:05:52] <toddmparker> Heading to a meeting
[12:06:02] <toddmparker> But I got iOS working with znc
[12:06:05] <toddmparker> Nice
[12:19:02] <ryanneufeld> nice
[12:19:03] <ryanneufeld> it's on
[12:58:44] <ajpiano> toddmparker: ping?
[13:07:42] <arschmitz_> johnbender: you there?
[13:14:14] <johnbender> arschmitz_: yes
[13:15:36] <arschmitz_> oh think i found an acceptable solution for ios6 using focusin and focusout
[13:15:48] <johnbender> arschmitz_: cool
[13:15:54] <arschmitz_> johnbender: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/287/edit
[13:16:52] <arschmitz_> johnbender: i took out all the ios 5 stuff so you could just see the part that matters
[13:18:10] <johnbender> arschmitz_: I'm assuming that viewportOffset forces a reflow
[13:18:49] <arschmitz_> johnbender: no that just calculates the amount the fixed elements are offset from the top of the viewport
[13:18:59] <arschmitz_> due to the keyboard pop
[13:20:24] <arschmitz_> johnbender: i use that to put them back in their proper place after the pop. they wont reflow on scroll like in ios5 but at least they are where they should be to start and after that its no different then without the fix
[13:22:35] <arschmitz_> johnbender: from what i can see you cant cause a reflow with the keyboard open like you can in ios5
[13:30:02] <johnbender> arschmitz_: yah I guess setting a timeout and updating the position after focusing makes me nervous, even if you were to unbind
[13:31:22] <arschmitz_> johnbender: yeah i tried to get around it but the position isnt updated yet when the focus occurs.
[13:31:48] <johnbender> arschmitz_: hmm, well hang on to it you can always get a second opinion :)
[13:39:37] <arschmitz_> johnbender: johnbender: ok i got a way without the settimeout actually if i bind to scroll with one inside focusin it will work the same.
[13:41:15] <arschmitz_> johnbender: scroll fires after focus on a keyboard pop and i only want it to update on the inital scroll not any user scroll after
[14:31:22] <johnbender> arschmitz_: what's the number?
[14:31:23] <johnbender> arschmitz_: the revision of the jsbin
[14:31:51] <arschmitz_> 295
[14:34:09] <gseguin> ajpiano: any idea where I can find the splunk charts that were presented at the end of day 2?
[14:43:26] <ajpiano> i think gnarf can hook you up
[14:49:08] <johnbender> arschmitz_: that's much more reasonable
[14:49:13] <arschmitz_> i thought so
[14:49:19] <johnbender> arschmitz_: we also have a throttled scroll binding that you can use
[14:49:31] <johnbender> err I think we do
[14:49:32] <johnbender> ...
[14:49:42] <arschmitz_> and with a little reworked i got that and the ios 5 fix into one nice package
[14:50:11] <arschmitz_> johnbender: i know there is scrollstop which is what i was going to use ill check out throttled scroll i didnt know about that
[14:51:07] <gseguin> gnarf: any idea where I can find the splunk charts that were presented at the end of day 2?
[14:53:28] <johnbender> arschmitz_: argh yes, scrollstop
[14:53:47] <johnbender> arschmitz_: I would get a second opinion, obviously we'd like to avoid binding to scroll if we can
[14:54:04] <johnbender> arschmitz_: and I don't know how painful that bug is
[14:54:36] <arschmitz_> johnbender: yeah ill check with wilto: and toddmparker: next week
[14:54:51] <Wilto> Yeah, sorry, kinda tuned out the second part of this week.
[14:55:05] <Wilto> Lotta post-Summit catching up to do.
[14:55:13] <arschmitz_> Wilto: yeah with the summit i figured
[14:56:22] <arschmitz_> Ill put some more thought into it this weekend to maybe see if i can find a way to avoid the scroll binding.
[15:53:35] <RWhitbeck> OMG THE POST-SUMMIT CATCH UP!!! Still working cause of that.
