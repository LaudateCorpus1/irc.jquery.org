[06:55:16] <MauriceG> Morning!
[07:03:09] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG!
[07:06:22] <MauriceG> Hi Jasper !
[07:13:24] <JasonDScott> Morning
[07:15:34] <uGoMobi> morning JasonDScott!
[07:16:28] <JasonDScott> Hey uGoMobi
[07:17:31] <Wilto> Present.
[07:19:26] <uGoMobi> morning Wilto
[08:36:30] <JasonDScott> Is anyone on familiar with our unit tests?
[08:49:29] <kborchers> JasonDScott: i am not particularly familiar with mobile's tests but have written a bunch of qunit tests for jQuery UI. what's up?
[08:55:59] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:56:44] <gseguin> JasonDScott: what do you want to know?
[08:57:43] <JasonDScott> gseguin kborchers: Well I am new to qunit, and the tutorials i have found have not been very extensive, would you know a good place to start learning? I am coming a jasmine testing background. I am trying to write the test for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4433
[08:57:44] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1d, 47m ago): Slider: Just create an ID for the label if it lacks
[08:59:27] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: a link a got from Scott http://benalman.com/talks/unit-testing-qunit.html (use arrow keys to nav)
[09:00:20] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin
[09:01:15] <gseguin> JasonDScott: test suites are module() in QUnit
[09:01:28] <gseguin> test cases are test() or asyncTest()
[09:01:51] <gseguin> asyncTest is just a shortcut to test() with a call to stop()
[09:02:06] <gseguin> to do async testing
[09:02:46] <gseguin> morning uGoMobi
[09:03:04] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Thanks, I will check that out
[09:03:54] <JasonDScott> gseguin: Thanks, I also need to add to the html correct?
[09:04:27] <gseguin> yeah so If your test case requires a page, you add it to the html page that starts the test for that module
[09:05:28] <gseguin> Wilto: you can try out the new builder
[09:05:43] <gseguin> it should spit out a structure and a theme now
[09:06:52] <uGoMobi> watch out, Wilto's specialty is break things
[09:07:02] <JasonDScott> gseguin: Thanks, I will that out
[09:07:52] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: when you are ready with the test I just see how you did it and copy ;-)
[09:07:59] <uGoMobi> have to start writing them too
[09:09:57] <johnbender> JasonDScott: if you create a new jqm page to test from make sure to use our pageSequence helper
[09:10:15] <johnbender> JasonDScott: it does the event bindings and timeout for you so that the tests work properly
[10:00:35] <ryanneufeld> hey guys
[10:06:07] <MauriceG> Hi all
[10:27:35] <johnbender> scottjehl: toddparker: are you guys floating around, I have a question?
[10:32:20] <johnbender> gseguin: you might also be able to shine light on this one since you're assinged :D
[10:32:25] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3726
[10:32:26] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3726 on jquery-mobile (Azuo; 2m, 3w ago): Ajax load may cause unnecessary network traffic
[10:32:31] <johnbender> I don't see the extra requests in chrome
[10:32:40] <johnbender> but what he's saying makes sense
[10:33:15] * gseguin has no idea why this bug is assigned to him
[10:35:54] <gseguin> johnbender: it would be great to have a jsbin to illustrate the issue
[10:36:04] <gseguin> what is saying does make sense
[10:40:42] <MauriceG> sorry johnbender, I've a fiddle that uses load page. May you can use as a quick template? : http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/TGBJp/
[10:41:12] <johnbender> MauriceG: I'll see what browser it is
[10:41:25] <johnbender> should be trivial to reproduce with the docs once he's responded
[10:41:36] <johnbender> gseguin: otherwise I want to close that issue and then close the pr since it's half way addressed

[11:05:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What do you think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4430/files? It's not a reload, but instead it's a changePage with fromHashChange set to false and changeHash set to true - IOW, as if the user had clicked a jqm link to get to the start page.

[11:10:20] <ryanneufeld> weinre for the win
[11:11:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: does that work with #/foo/bar.html&ui-state=dialog
[11:11:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Let's find out ...
[11:11:36] <johnbender> note to everyone
[11:11:42] <johnbender> _
[11:11:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: in that case we'd want to load /foo/bar.html obviously
[11:12:04] <johnbender> note to everyone
[11:12:13] <johnbender> the build failures are a non issue
[11:12:23] <johnbender> the stable failure is a java memory error
[11:12:42] <johnbender> and the Master should resolve
[11:13:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Wait, lemme get this straight: So http://jquerymobile.com/branches/fix-4423/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html#/branches/fix-4423/docs/pages/popup/index.html&ui-state=dialog will result in page-dialogs.html?
[11:14:58] <johnbender> no
[11:15:13] <johnbender> popup/index.html
[11:15:17] <johnbender> or that's what I would think at least
[11:15:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Aha! Understood.
[11:15:21] <johnbender> since we're ignoring the dialog
[11:15:26] <johnbender> I could be wrong
[11:15:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, that makes sense ...
[11:16:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nono, it totally makes sense: Think about it - I'm looking at the main page for popup, and I totally like it. My device does not support pushState. I email the link to my friend so he can give his opinion.
[11:16:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: He should definitely get to see the popup main page, and not the dialogs main page.
[11:17:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you have time to test something?
[11:17:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Atch! Doesn't work.
[11:18:07] <agcolom> uGoMobi, yes...
[11:18:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: As it is, it goes to page-dialogs.html ... OK ... NP ... we can fix this.

[11:19:03] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-) yes, we're forgetting manners ;-)
[11:19:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: sorry, it's always so damn complicated :(
[11:19:23] <uGoMobi> lol yes   only focused on issues ;-)
[11:19:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I would think you could just strip the dialog state out of there and proceed as normal with the deep link eh?
[11:19:28] <johnbender> but I could be wrong
[11:19:37] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hang on...
[11:19:54] <uGoMobi> agcolom: http://jsfiddle.net/p2Z9r/
[11:20:21] <uGoMobi> there we mistakes in that test page, so better use this one ^^
[11:20:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll try that next.
[11:21:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll load that link, and follow it through init and into changePage and see what it does with the path in the hash first though ...
[11:21:19] <uGoMobi> there were... i meant (tsss, can't type)
[11:21:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... see why it gets ignored.

[11:25:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Will that be "jarring" as well?
[11:27:26] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I don't understand what the issue is. What does the guy mean by slide left?
[11:28:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: swipe left
[11:29:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but still I don't understand the issue either
[11:29:32] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ok, I swipe left, nothing happens... is anything supposed to happen? ah, is there something bound to a swipe?
[11:29:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sounds normal to me that you have to click inside the select if you want to select something
[11:30:10] <agcolom> well, yes, and all looks good in the address bar on pressing the send button...
[11:30:47] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes event bound to swipe left but i see another mistake... corrected in this version http://jsfiddle.net/p2Z9r/1/
[11:31:05] <agcolom> uGoMobi, ok trying now...
[11:31:13] <JasonDScott> johnbender: I made a PR for the tests, could you review it?

[11:33:25] <gseguin> Wilto: :)
[11:33:51] <gseguin> agcolom: no problem, I needed it done to test it so I wasn't going to wait, no worries
[11:33:57] <agcolom> wilto: could that help my students understand/get into JavaScript?
[11:34:10] <gseguin> Wilto: I was going to send you this: http://caniuse.com/#feat=border-radius

[11:34:40] <Wilto> I can never remember which is the one without border radius.

[12:22:35] <johnbender> agcolom: unless that's changed we don't want them using the special function
[12:22:44] <johnbender> but it may have changed since the last time I looked
[12:23:03] <johnbender> the callback should receive data with an orientation property which is what we want to provide
[12:23:51] <johnbender> JasonDScott: I commented on your tests PR
[12:23:53] <johnbender> just a couple nitpicks
[12:25:12] <JasonDScott> johnbender: Thanks! Nitpicking is good, the quality is important.
[12:25:46] <agcolom> johnbender: ok. Does that apply also to https://github.com/chetankjain/jquery-mobile/commit/ee4fbb5189b72711d2070bb8bc18fa2fbcd3d0b3 then, and shall I revert that?

[12:26:31] <johnbender> agcolom: no, that's a property they can set as a configuration
[12:26:40] <johnbender> the other one is information provided to the callback
[12:26:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I've gotten a little further: With a simple 				location.hash = location.hash.replace( $.mobile.dialogHashKey, "" );
[12:26:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I've been able to get the deep-linking to work.
[12:27:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: does that creata a history entry?
[12:27:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nice
[12:27:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nope.
[12:27:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The problem is that the pushState handler still sets the window title and the location to the actual page.
[12:27:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: "the actual page"
[12:27:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There's a second hashchange event because of my setting location.hash
[12:27:58] <johnbender> right
[12:28:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The one in the URL, not in the hash.
[12:28:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I can make _handleHashChange ignore it by setting $.mobile.urlHistory.ignoreNextHashChange, but the pushState handler's flag is unreachable.
[12:28:35] <agcolom> johnbender: thanks a lot.
[12:28:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: so you're making that hash change after all our hashchange bindings have taking place?
[12:28:52] <johnbender> agcolom: np np, thanks for asking :D
[12:29:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Even if I do it before, the hashchange event still happens, for some reason ...
[12:29:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: :/
[12:29:29] <johnbender> that's no good :)
[12:29:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: alternatively we could just leave the dialog state on there
[12:29:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I tried to do it as early as https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.init.js#L16 ...
[12:29:52] <johnbender> and load the right page
[12:30:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah it'll have to come well before all that
[12:30:26] <johnbender> like in the core module
[12:30:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK - can do.
[12:30:38] <johnbender> all the library bindings have happened at that point
[12:30:51] <johnbender> it's just waiting to get started enhancing the default page
[12:30:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We absolutely need to remove the dialog hash, because that's what's causing the bug.
[12:31:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can you link the bug again
[12:31:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: When you go back, it thinks that since it's going to a dialog hash page, it doesn't need to do a changePage, but it does!
[12:31:34] <johnbender> I'm just approaching this from "doing the right thing on a dialog deep link"
[12:31:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4423
[12:31:54] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4423 on jquery-mobile (gabrielschulhof; 2d, 1h ago): Navigation: When the initial page has a dialogHashKey, navigation breaks after link-click followed by "Back"
[12:33:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah because the hashchange handler has all that bullshit special casing
[12:33:12] <johnbender> ... that I wrote
[12:33:13] <johnbender> :(
[12:33:23] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[12:33:24] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom 1.1-stable build #31: FIXED in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%201.1-stable/31/
[12:33:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and it's fine, but it doesn't handle this corner case.
[12:33:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The fundamental problem is that given a hashchange event, we don't know what caused it.
[12:33:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Did the user click "Back"?
[12:34:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Did the user click "Forward"?
[12:34:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Something else?
[12:34:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We just dunno, and we're making a best guess in _handleHashChange ...
[12:34:42] <johnbender> correct
[12:34:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... so we end up with corner cases like this.
[12:35:03] <deAtog> _|Nix|_: I remember having this same conversation about a month ago :-)
[12:35:34] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: Yeah, it's a fundamental browser problem. We should have a "user-clicked-back" event ...
[12:35:38] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: ... etc.
[12:35:59] <_|Nix|_> But anyway, lemme see if the real-early-hash-overwrite works.
[12:36:38] <deAtog> _|Nix|_: the appropriate way to fix it is to add a unique id in the hash for every new page
[12:37:25] <deAtog> _|Nix|_: without something like that, it will be forever impossible to determine if the user clicked back or forward
[12:38:43] <agcolom> johnbender: I've spotted this one which should be fairly straight forward... (i.e. either the code or the comment is right, but which is it?) https://github.com/chetankjain/jquery-mobile/commit/140eab71e93ed6d5d0d8d714b7ea7766826fc096#diff-0
[12:38:43] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by chetankjain (1d, 31m ago): Fixes #4435 Checking orientationchange event native support in teardown function
[12:39:07] <agcolom> Quick link to the full js file: https://github.com/chetankjain/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.event.js
[12:40:58] <johnbender> agcolom: I would ask for tests there, and if he doesn't supply them we'll have to address it
[12:41:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I added it here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L15 ... and still two hashchange events ...
[12:41:06] <johnbender> you can probably mark that issue as high
[12:41:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: make sure it's happening before the bindings, maybe I'm wrong about core or something
[12:42:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ...
[12:42:25] <agcolom> johnbender: ok, will do now...
[12:42:28] <uGoMobi> johnbender: agcolom: he told me he just installed Git on local machine is going to use it
[12:43:22] <johnbender> uGoMobi: who's that?
[12:43:41] <uGoMobi> johnbender: chetankjain
[12:43:52] <uGoMobi> the one who created that pull
[12:43:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you might also try altering https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1403
[12:44:09] <johnbender> by requiring that the stack length be greater than 2
[12:44:23] <johnbender> so that it's not checking against the first page
[12:44:34] <johnbender> seems like a silly idea
[12:44:39] <johnbender> let me try it
[12:45:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that works lol
[12:45:58] <johnbender> that way we won't alter the hash either in case people are storing their own data in there for whatever reason
[12:46:05] <johnbender> me thinks there might be implications there though
[12:46:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I have /got/ to see that ...
[12:46:13] <johnbender> lawl
[12:46:16] <johnbender> it's so ghetoo
[12:46:20] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:46:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: going to eat some lunch
[12:46:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll run the test suite ..
[12:53:16] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that active guy chetankjain is currently writing a book about jQuery Mobile: http://www.chetankjain.net/
[13:01:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I lied I'm going to get lunch at like 1:30
[13:01:28] <johnbender> lol
[13:07:18] <agcolom> uGoMobi: oh, interesting!
[13:07:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah I thought so. Seems like he is rewriting the docs too ;-)
[13:08:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, the tests all run except popup. Fortunately that's something I know how to fix :)
[13:08:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, unless you can think of an overwhelming reason against making this change, I'm all thumbs up.
[13:30:22] <JasonDScott> johnbender: I made those changes
[13:37:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: which the change from 1 to 2?
[13:37:04] <johnbender> or your proposed fix
[13:37:08] <johnbender> JasonDScott: looking
[13:38:43] <johnbender> JasonDScott: merge it
[13:39:16] <JasonDScott> Thanks

[13:40:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #4449 from jasondscott/3981_SliderIdTests - Jason Scott
[13:41:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Actually, changing from 1 to 2 really messes up popups. The problem is that, if the initial page has the hash set, the popup will create a new history entry for itself, but because we have the > 2, that causes a pagechange, so the page loads itself, but scrolled to 0.
[13:41:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, clicking a popup further down the page causes the page to jump to 0.
[13:41:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OTOH, if I don't create a new history entry, the user cannot close the popup using the "Back" button.
[13:42:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Dialogs work fine with this change because they /are/ pages, so a pagechange is expected.
[13:42:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: My proposed fix is incomplete because I cannot make the pushState handler ignore the extra hashchange.
[13:42:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and it seems to get the hashchange even if I modify the hash right from core.
[13:44:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I added breakpoints to both places where hashchange handlers are being attached (navigation and pushState), and I have found that I had already tried to put the dialog-hash-key-stripping code in front of those lines, and I /still/ got the hashchange ...
[13:44:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, unless I gain some public interface to the pushState handler, I cannot prevent it from changing the location and the window title.
[13:46:32] <uGoMobi> time for some night life... have a great weekend everyone!!
[13:46:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Have a good one!
[13:46:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks, you too!
[13:49:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: very odd
[13:49:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm
[13:50:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm guessing that a hashchange is a real event and it's stored in the event queue, and all js code has to unwind before it's fetched ... so, I'd have to put the rest of core ona setTimeout( function() { theRestOfCore(); }, 0);
[13:50:46] <johnbender> hah
[13:50:49] <johnbender> crazy town
[13:50:50] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:51:22] <_|Nix|_> But if I can have an ignoreNextHashChange for pushState, I'm all set.
[13:51:39] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm scared of exposing that
[13:51:48] <_|Nix|_> I'm looking at pushState to see if there's any way to recognize that I should ignore that hashchange.
[13:51:54] <johnbender> just because it's such a tangled mess as it is
[13:52:45] <Wilto> ?mlm
[13:52:53] <Wilto> …Stupid bot-t.
[13:52:57] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... I mean, I can define a $.mobile._someFlagThatIndicatesToPushStateToIgnoreTheNextHashChange and then check it from there, but I'd rather avoid that.
[14:02:37] <agcolom> toddparker ??
[14:15:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ... your solution is better than mine, because yours only breaks popups, whereas mine breaks both popups and dialogs ...
[14:19:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I've been able to un-fsck popups somewhat by putting a $.mobile.urlHistory.ignoreNextHashChange in front of my $.mobile.path.set() call.
[14:19:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The unit tests will tell the rest of the story.
[14:21:18] <Wilto> I’d watch a crime drama that contained the line “the unit tests will tell the rest of the story.”
[14:24:09] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: ROTFL :)
[14:48:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nice
[14:48:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks for working at that
[14:48:16] <johnbender> nav is ... an issue right now
[14:54:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP. There are still some glitches with your change. If the initial page has both a deeplink and a dialog hash key and you can open a dialog from the resulting page, the dialog will create a second, identical history entry, and when you move back and forth between the two, there is a transition, even though both are the same page.
[14:54:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I suspect that's because urlHistory is not being kept correctly, and it thinks it's two different pages.
[14:55:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... but I'll look at these glitches later, because it's hay time for me.
[14:55:32] <_|Nix|_> L8R all!
