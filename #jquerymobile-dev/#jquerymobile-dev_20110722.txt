[00:32:36] <mazzachre> I belive I have found an error in the "official" css for jquery mobile... Will anyone here take note? Or is there a bug reporting system?
[04:29:10] <mazzachre> Some problems with the code not being firefox (desktop) compatible... Page does really strange things, I imagine because of lack of some transition events?
[15:52:42] <nicovalencia> hey folks. funny bug I've been working on for a bit: anchor vclick is bound to a handler that prevents default, manages some state vars, and calls changePage. Seemingly random, it will set the hash route to the actual route ( index.html#other/pages.html?stuff=stuff becomes -> other/pages.html?stuff=stuff )
[15:52:44] <nicovalencia> I can only get it to error on an iPhone. The app can't be changing the url - it's a single page app that manages lots of state vars so it can't re-bootstrap in the middle of a page transition.
[15:52:46] <nicovalencia> It also errors in the iPhone sim.
[20:02:00] <nimbu> bot-t: tell gseguin https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.transition.js#L19 should use reverseClassname not 'reverse' in the class
[20:02:00] <bot-t> nimbu, Okay.
