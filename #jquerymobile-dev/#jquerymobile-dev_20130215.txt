[00:58:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good morning
[01:00:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: URL for latest will be view.jquerymobile.com
[01:01:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the index page is in the root, same as old docs, but it's name is stage.index.html for the moment
[01:02:01] <uGoMobi> I don't know why http://jquerymobile.com/test/demos/ doesn't work
[01:19:10] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! WTF: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'call' of undefined in beta.1 when you scroll a page. You can invoke this error by dragging the scrollbar's page in any of the API doc examples where the iframe has a scrollbar.

[01:22:56] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14e7b4b92 15Gabriel Schulhof: Page: Created new entry documenting the page widget.
[01:22:57] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Thanks! _|Nix|_ Thanks! 
[01:27:09] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I have pushed the new page widget but it has not yet showed up at http://api.jquerymobile.com/page/ ... does that take a while, or is there some place in the repo where I have to make a reference to the new entry?
[01:32:13] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: it won't show up until I tag. However, it should show up at stage.api.jquerymobile.com
[01:32:35] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: well... at stage.api.jquerymobile.com/page/
[01:34:45] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Aaah, OK.
[01:35:35] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... and locally too ...
[01:35:44] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes,
[01:36:16] <agcolom> the only thing is the example... By default I get the page, header, content and footer
[01:36:35] <agcolom> so we don't need to add that again
[01:37:07] <_|Nix|_> Wait a sec, so what should be the example?
[01:37:12] <agcolom> btw sorry for letting everyone down last night... My boiler started making a crazy noise.... 
[01:37:17] <agcolom> and now it's dead!
[01:37:29] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's not good. How will you have hot water?
[01:37:39] <agcolom> well, I have a kettle ;-)
[01:37:55] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's going to make for an interesting shower ...
[01:37:59] <agcolom> I'm waiting for British Gas to call me back to organise the reapirs...
[01:38:06] <agcolom> indeed! 
[01:38:31] <agcolom> Also it's very cold at the moment... and it's 16 in my bedroom (the warmest room in the house!)
[01:38:47] <agcolom> right so example...
[01:38:50] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: *sigh* ... takes me back to my bad old communist days ...
[01:39:04] <agcolom> lol ;-) (hope that's allowed ;-) )
[01:39:12] <_|Nix|_> :)
[01:39:21] <agcolom> let me check what goes in the example...
[01:40:28] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: If that's the stuff in entries2html.xsl then that's not exactly the same as my example.
[01:41:31] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Oh, crap! I see it now - it's a page within a page!
[01:41:43] <agcolom> yes
[01:41:58] <agcolom> so you can omit the page... 
[01:42:26] <agcolom> so I remember now, I got the header, content and footer out of the default 
[01:42:40] <agcolom> but I still have page inside the default example template
[01:43:57] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK. That's fine. I get it now.
[01:44:01] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Thanks!
[01:44:10] <agcolom> np :-) 
[01:46:50] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: May I also update the reference to point to rc.1 js/css instead of beta.1? beta.1 has a weird JS error when you scroll an example, but rc.1 seems fine.
[01:47:12] <agcolom> yes please :-)
[01:47:15] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[01:48:22] <_|Nix|_> Done.
[01:48:36] <agcolom> great! thanks!

[01:48:37] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14d20fa46 15Gabriel Schulhof: Page: Fix example
[01:48:37] <_|Nix|_> Now, I have to figure out why the page example is not working in FF.
[01:48:59] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: none of the examples are working in FF
[01:49:15] <agcolom> it's a pb with the #
[01:49:54] <agcolom> so if you click on one of the option links for example, the address bar will have a #followed by something and the browser is happy and displays the example!
[01:51:17] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: It's because we're using replaceState.
[01:51:19] <agcolom> FF fires an error, so could be something to do with hash something listening (can't remember the name) in JQM, so we may have to force it not to listen to hash something... 
[01:51:30] <agcolom> ah!
[01:51:35] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: We need to turn off pushState for the examples.
[01:51:47] <agcolom> that sounds right 
[01:52:28] <agcolom> I tried something else a while ago and it didn't fix it, but I've not tried this one (and you know more about this thing than me so sounds like something to try!)
[02:15:27] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[02:15:27] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #269: FIXED in 14 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/269/
[02:16:58] <_|Nix|_> Argh! My script gets prefixed with window.onload = function() { ... I can't turn off pushState!
[02:20:06] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: If you're around - can you please tell me why in https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/blob/master/entries2html.xsl#L15 if I add a script tag with no src attribute but one that contains a bit of script, then that bit of script is prepended with "window.onload = function() {" resulting in an unbalanced brace (which I can correct), but also rendering my script useless, because it has to execute sooner than that?
[02:30:24] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, I got it to work by putting the script inside a file hosted on my own domain and referring to that file. So, if adding the script inline doesn't work (because it gets prepended like that) then what's a good place to store it inside the api.jquerymobile.com repository - since it will be referred to from every example, and I don't know if one can upload scripts to wordpress.
[02:31:17] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Alternatively, is there a way of declaring the script tag such that it does not get that function declaration/assignment prepended?
[02:32:26] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: So, I got it to work, but I had to insert another script in front of jquery.mobile-1.3.0-rc.1.min.js ... that script has to live somewhere (currently http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/turnOffPushState.js).

[03:55:13] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ^
[04:04:08] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: thanks for getting rid of those empty panels. i started doing that, but got distracted.
[04:04:27] <toddmparker> morning all
[04:04:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: np
[04:04:44] <uGoMobi> good morning
[04:05:14] <toddmparker> agcolom: you asked about the new url?
[04:06:24] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: what do you think about removing the border top from the footer and give it same padding as content?
[04:07:34] <uGoMobi> not sure how padding will look but personally don't like the border because we use it for seperators too
[04:08:27] <toddmparker> for what reason? if you want to point to the version snapshot of the demos like 1.3.0 final to go with the 1.3.0 api docs, it would be view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/
[04:09:07] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: sure
[04:10:38] <toddmparker> i also want to remove the stroke and extra margin after the intro paragraph but only for Q&A pages. I thought I had a class I could tie into but it's not there so we may need to add a faq class somewhere to scope tweaks against
[04:10:57] <toddmparker> so any idea what's up with /test/ ?
[04:11:46] <toddmparker> i can't even deep link to a page like http://jquerymobile.com/test/demos/widgets/pages/index.html
[04:11:58] <uGoMobi> I know
[04:12:10] <toddmparker> must be a server setup thing
[04:12:15] <uGoMobi> looks like test can only show docs/ folder
[04:12:18] <uGoMobi> yeah
[04:12:52] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15thinframe opened issue #5645: Clicking on empty body add/removes ui-fixed-hidden from footer  02http://git.io/kgKKjw
[04:13:09] <toddmparker> is gnarf around?
[04:13:23] <toddmparker> maybe johnbender or gseguin will know too
[04:13:54] <uGoMobi> yeah will ask them when they are here
[04:14:06] <toddmparker> must be something higher up in the directory structure we can't see in GH
[04:16:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I will add a faq class to the page container of all the faq pages
[04:16:30] <toddmparker> ok. i was going to do that but wasn't sure if i was missing something
[04:18:05] <uGoMobi> I think I removed your class at some point because it wasn't used in the CSS
[04:18:25] <uGoMobi> can be bit OCD when it comes to cleaning up markup ;)
[04:18:47] <uGoMobi> so will add a class again
[04:19:33] <toddmparker> i did some hackery to prototype the section link positioning … the intro has a lot of bottom padding and i use negative top margin to move that up above the stroke. we could change the js to put the bun whew want and make that css less terrible
[04:19:54] <toddmparker> i just wasn't 100% sure if we liked this position currently
[04:20:20] <toddmparker> odd is good. i tend to hack stuff out as i design in the browser. i need some odd cleanup after me
[04:20:33] <toddmparker> ocd, not odd.
[04:20:36] <uGoMobi> nice team work :)
[04:20:40] <toddmparker> heh
[04:20:51] <toddmparker> i break stuff, you fix it. like this arrangement.
[04:21:00] <uGoMobi> lol
[04:21:29] <toddmparker> demos are feeling pretty solid now. lots of little broken stuff getting cleaned up.
[04:21:51] <uGoMobi> yeah we are getting close
[04:22:34] <toddmparker> i hadn't taken a pass thru the faqs at all until last night
[04:22:59] <toddmparker> it's a good place to convert all our old notes and tips into content here
[04:23:36] <uGoMobi> when we are done layouting I will go thru the CSS
[04:23:44] <uGoMobi> same layout just cleaner CSS
[04:24:22] <uGoMobi> yeah, FAQ is good place for know issues

[05:04:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toddmparker: the problem with test is thats a proxy
[05:04:56] <arschmitz> i mentioned in the meeting yesterday before i had to run about this
[05:05:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right
[05:05:09] <arschmitz> because /test/ is a built version
[05:05:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: already thought that was the issue
[05:05:16] <arschmitz> it only builds out the docs
[05:05:18] <toddmparker> Ah, so it's a gnarf thing 
[05:05:49] <arschmitz> no i think its a build thing
[05:06:03] <toddmparker> So it's something we can fix
[05:06:06] <arschmitz> i think so
[05:06:16] <toddmparker> Great
[05:06:35] <arschmitz> let me look real quick at the grunt build and see if i can see where we are doing it
[05:06:49] <uGoMobi> I could only find this related file https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.docs.js
[05:10:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/build/docs.build.js
[05:12:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, that's the file that made me aware of jquery.mobile.docs.js
[05:13:12] <uGoMobi> I just couldn't find anything that refers to the /docs/ folder
[05:13:22] <arschmitz> yeah im not completely sure

[06:45:11] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15leon92 opened issue #5647: Panel in Dialig  02http://git.io/DA_vWg
[06:59:35] <uGoMobi> panel in dialog? how come we never think of that when we test? ;)
[07:01:56] <toddmparker> Eh
[07:02:15] <toddmparker> How about a panel in a popup :p
[07:09:35] <arschmitz> panel in dialog wont work because its not a page
[07:09:48] <arschmitz> it does not have data-role page to fine closest page
[07:10:41] <arschmitz> personally i think we should depreciated dialogs in their current state and just make them a special styled page and treat them exactly the same as a page
[07:10:58] <toddmparker> arschmitz: that is an option
[07:11:14] <toddmparker> now that we have proper popups, they are less useful
[07:11:21] <arschmitz> yup
[07:11:29] <toddmparker> and introduce a lot of exceptions
[07:11:34] <arschmitz> exactly
[07:11:34] <uGoMobi> +1
[07:11:39] <arschmitz> kinda like nested listviews
[07:13:05] <toddmparker> i think that change is big enough that we need to socialize it and plan on deprecating in 1.4
[07:13:14] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:13:54] <toddmparker> ideally, we'd be able to keep the styling and transitions for dialogs but maybe simplify the nag impact
[07:13:59] <toddmparker> add it to the wiki!
[07:14:01] <arschmitz> exactly
[07:14:11] <arschmitz> im all for the styling and all that
[07:14:13] <toddmparker> the panel in a popup seems really odd
[07:14:17] <arschmitz> but just make it a special page style
[07:14:19] <uGoMobi> we can add option dialog to page and we apply different styling
[07:14:28] <toddmparker> right
[07:14:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: exactly
[07:14:46] <toddmparker> the transitions work a bit differently but that is minor
[07:14:52] <arschmitz> panel in a popup makes not sense
[07:14:59] <toddmparker> won't fix
[07:15:06] <arschmitz> panels are a page level widget
[07:15:09] <uGoMobi> yeah gonna close it
[07:15:11] <toddmparker> yep
[07:15:34] <toddmparker> be complex to make the styles work with that inset popup look
[07:15:48] <arschmitz> not to mention how would transition work
[07:15:56] <arschmitz> it can be hidden off page and slide in
[07:15:58] <toddmparker> dunno.
[07:15:59] <arschmitz> cant*
[07:16:03] <uGoMobi> we shouldn't support bad UI
[07:16:09] <toddmparker> +1
[07:16:10] <arschmitz> i agree
[07:16:47] <toddmparker> jQuery Mobile: We Have Opinions on your UI tm
[07:16:55] <arschmitz> lol
[07:17:08] <arschmitz> they are welcome to write their own widget to support their bad ui 
[07:17:34] <uGoMobi> dialog with panel that contains a popup?
[07:17:51] <uGoMobi> including support for fixed toolbars?
[07:17:53] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:20:06] <arschmitz> i want a nested listview inside my dialog with a panel and fixed toolbars all in a listview i think
[07:21:00] <arschmitz> and the option to open it as a popup in link attribute

[07:22:18] <uGoMobi> at different location
[07:22:27] <toddmparker> uGoMobi broke everything. It's his fault.
[07:23:05] <uGoMobi> << new Wilto
[07:25:42] <uGoMobi> and gseguin is away
[07:25:45] <uGoMobi> :(
[07:29:06] <gseguin> uGoMobi: sorry on the bus, connection is spotty in 2 areas
[07:29:17] <gseguin> what can I help with?
[07:30:26] <uGoMobi> gseguin: the demos folder is in the root now
[07:30:33] <uGoMobi> sibling of docs
[07:30:37] <gseguin> on master?
[07:30:41] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:31:00] <uGoMobi> but jquerymobile.com/test/demos/... doesn't work
[07:31:09] <gseguin> wow you guys like to take risks like that right before release? :P
[07:31:45] <gseguin> ok, so the build and deploy probably need a little massage?
[07:31:57] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:32:00] <gseguin> or actually that's probably a proxy
[07:32:04] <gseguin> let me check
[07:32:10] <uGoMobi> it is
[07:35:29] <arschmitz> hey guys gota run my wifes grandmother just had a heart attack
[07:35:59] <arschmitz> i need to go meet them at hospital
[07:36:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's terrible
[07:36:06] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[07:36:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: be careful
[07:36:23] <uGoMobi> hope she is going to be ok
[07:36:51] <gseguin> arschmitz: oh man! hope she's going to be ok
[07:37:40] <gseguin> uGoMobi: gseguin@eol2:/srv/jquerymobile.com/htdocs$ ls -tlr test

[07:38:40] <gseguin> Am I on the right server?
[07:40:04] <uGoMobi> I dunno
[07:40:18] <gseguin> Paging Dr. Bender
[07:41:32] <uGoMobi> I am starting to get the picture now
[07:42:20] <uGoMobi>   /test/ is symlinked to the compiled/demos/ folder
[07:43:52] <uGoMobi> so you can't just browse any folder in master root
[07:44:05] <uGoMobi> only what is included in the build
[07:44:53] <uGoMobi> can we include both /docs/ and /demos/ folders in the build for the moment?
[07:45:06] <uGoMobi> and remove /docs/ on monday
[07:45:21] <gseguin> uGoMobi: did my last mesages go through?
[07:45:42] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I need to know what you last message was to answer that ;)
[07:45:48] <uGoMobi> your*
[07:46:52] <uGoMobi> gseguin: it can wait until you are off the bus if that's easier
[07:47:10] <gseguin> uGoMobi: gseguin@eol2:/srv/jquerymobile.com/htdocs$ ls -tlr test

[07:47:35] <gseguin> Paging Dr. Bender
[07:48:10] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yeah, msg came through
[07:48:37] <gseguin> so I don't really know what's going on
[07:48:47] <gseguin> there is no proxy for test/
[07:48:53] <uGoMobi> neither do I
[07:48:58] <gseguin> it's  a symlink
[07:49:02] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:49:40] <uGoMobi> what I can try is to see if can include both folders in the build
[07:50:53] <uGoMobi> I can even try that in a branch so I won't break latest if it doesn't work
[07:51:29] <gseguin> let me dig a little bit on the server
[07:51:35] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[07:53:04] <gseguin> ha!
[07:53:11] <gseguin> there is a proxy

[08:10:11] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 14ade7b67 15Gabriel Schulhof: entries2html.xsl: Turn off pushState to make examples work on FF. Fixes #11
[08:10:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: FF should work now ^
[08:11:35] <toddmparker> arschmitz: so sorry to hear that. Hope she's going to be ok.
[08:12:36] <gseguin> ok I'm now connected to a real network
[08:13:15] <toddmparker> hey gseguin 
[08:13:27] <toddmparker> this is a big change, which is why i want to do it now
[08:13:43] <gseguin> hey toddmparker 
[08:13:55] <gseguin> Yeah so looking at the config of jquerymobile.com
[08:14:00] <gseguin> I see:
[08:14:12] <toddmparker> i think we can make the switch today where /test/ is just the new demos folder.
[08:14:17] <gseguin> ProxyPass /test http://builder.jquerymobile.com/test
[08:14:27] <toddmparker> the old /docs/ folder doesn't need to be part of the build for 1.3
[08:14:39] <toddmparker> (zip)
[08:14:53] <gseguin> I don't have access to builder.jquerymobile.com
[08:15:16] <gseguin> gnarf: ^ (this time it's a purposeful highlight)
[08:15:24] <toddmparker> if we can make it so we can still get to jqm.com/test/docs = old docs for a while so we can preview the old stuff, that would be convenient
[08:15:38] <toddmparker> but that's not important
[08:17:07] <gseguin> that shouldn't be a problem
[08:17:35] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I think you can preview the backup branch that I made
[08:17:44] <gseguin> but I need access to builder.jquerymobile.com to figure out how the directories are laid out
[08:19:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/backup-before-removing-docs/index.html
[08:20:38] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: are you there?
[08:21:12] <gseguin> man! these left coasters what a bunch of slackers! ;P

[08:24:15] <uGoMobi> gseguin: good thing you moved 
[08:24:30] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I know, right ;)
[08:24:35] <uGoMobi> :)
[08:31:16] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yep, that branch was a good idea for a backup
[08:31:28] <toddmparker> so we can actually delete /demos/ then?
[08:31:43] <toddmparker> sorry, *docs*
[08:31:45] <toddmparker> sheesh
[08:40:46] <johnbender> gseguin: uGoMobi: whats up?
[08:42:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: if we delete the /docs/ folder we break latest
[08:42:19] <uGoMobi> we have to update some other things first
[08:43:46] <uGoMobi> i was thinking not to delete /docs/ all at once but go thru it and delete parts files of which we know they have found new place in API docs or demos
[08:44:28] <uGoMobi> we might run into things we didn't moved yet... like the config demos
[08:44:35] <uGoMobi> johnbender: hey
[08:45:00] <uGoMobi> johnbender: we copied /demos/ to the root on master
[08:45:50] <uGoMobi> johnbender: we are now looking into getting /test/demos/... to work
[08:46:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: the demos folder requires a deploy
[08:46:42] <_|Nix|_> Is there a way to detect whether we're running in an iframe or not? I had to turn off pushState for the API examples to work in FF: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/page (see example HTML at the bottom). However, that means the example contains code that doesn't really pertain to the example...
[08:46:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes
[08:47:07] <johnbender> window.this == window.something
[08:47:11] <johnbender> let me look
[08:47:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, we should modify the pushState support code to turn off pushState if we're inside an iframe and running inside FF.
[08:47:41] <johnbender> I don't think we support that
[08:47:44] <johnbender> :(
[08:47:53] <johnbender> I could be wrong though
[08:47:54] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah I just started to get the picture of how it works
[08:47:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That would obviate the need for <script src="/resources/turnOffPushState.js"></script>
[08:59:01] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: i am now
[08:59:03] <ryanneufeld> whats up
[09:04:59] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: could you give me access to builder.jquerymobile.com?
[09:05:23] <gseguin> johnbender: I think we need to change the proxy rule on jquerymobile.com for /test
[09:05:38] <johnbender> gseguin: what's the goal?
[09:05:40] <johnbender> but yes I think so
[09:05:57] <johnbender> I was confused yesterday
[09:06:01] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: sure, what's the magic word?
[09:06:11] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: please
[09:06:20] <ryanneufeld> BZZZT try again :p
[09:06:32] <ryanneufeld> J/k
[09:06:34] <ryanneufeld> I'm doing itnow
[09:06:42] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: sorry for my lack of manners
[09:06:58] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: I was only teasing, :p
[09:07:15] <gseguin> johnbender: They moved demos out of docs
[09:07:29] <johnbender> gseguin: and where does test point now?
[09:08:13] <gseguin> I don't know yet because I don't have access to the machine
[09:09:03] <gseguin> but jquerymobile.com/test -> builder.jquerymobile.com/test
[09:10:11] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: should have it soonly
[09:10:22] <gseguin> thank you sir
[09:12:41] <ryanneufeld> gseguin: should be good to go now 
[09:13:02] <gseguin> Permission denied (publickey)
[09:13:17] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: I have to keys on file
[09:13:23] <gseguin> s/to/two/
[09:13:33] <ryanneufeld> okay
[09:14:12] <ryanneufeld> I have two in the config for you here
[09:31:55] <gseguin> uGoMobi: /test points to docs
[09:32:06] <gseguin> and you want it to point to demos, right?
[09:32:18] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes
[09:32:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: is it ok if we make the switch now?
[09:33:04] <gseguin> I can do that without modifying the build
[09:33:16] <uGoMobi> gseguin: great
[09:33:42] <uGoMobi> gseguin: just want to check with toddmparker 
[09:34:30] <gseguin> by just changing the test symlink to point to compiled/demos/docs/demos/ instead of compiled/demos
[09:34:51] <uGoMobi> gseguin: but that's not the right folder
[09:35:15] <uGoMobi> demos will no longer be subfolder of docs
[09:35:15] <gseguin> uGoMobi: really?
[09:35:25] <uGoMobi> they are siblings now
[09:35:39] <gseguin> did that change happen ?
[09:35:52] <gseguin> oh I see what you're saying
[09:35:52] <uGoMobi> yes
[09:36:34] <uGoMobi> same setup... index file is in root and the index file of the folder is a redirect one level up
[09:36:39] <gseguin> the build however does not copy demos in compiled
[09:36:48] <uGoMobi> right
[09:37:03] <gseguin> can you add that?
[09:37:38] <gseguin> 1. rename compiled/demos to compiled/docs
[09:37:52] <gseguin> 2. add the copy of demos to compiled/demos
[09:38:51] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I'm busy with Jive stuff today but I can change the symlink
[09:39:10] <gseguin> however if more is needed I'll try to do it over the weekend
[09:39:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok I will look into that
[09:39:32] <uGoMobi> gseguin: thanks for the help
[09:39:45] <gseguin> alright, ping me when you need me to make change to the server
[09:40:09] <uGoMobi> ok I will
[09:58:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: In addition to the current settings, if ( window.top !== window && navigator.userAgent.indexOf( "Firefox" ) >= 0 ) then pushState must be off.
[09:58:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's if we support iframes though right?
[09:59:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, do we have a support setting for that?
[09:59:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that is I don't want to get into the business of supporting iframes

[09:59:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, we support them insofar as we don't die inside an iframe.
[09:59:45] <johnbender> that's not really support perse
[10:00:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We're /aware/ of the fact ... barely ...

[10:00:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Another thing is that this should probably go into 1.3.0, because all the examples on api.jquerymobile.com will refer to 1.3.0 ...
[10:00:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and without this change none of them will work in FF.
[10:01:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... unless we pollute the example with my script.
[10:01:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmmm
[10:01:31] <johnbender> yes we'd certainly be giving the impression that everything works in FF in that case
[10:01:34] <johnbender> err
[10:01:38] <johnbender> s/FF/iframes/
[10:01:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So either the example has to have a comment saying <!-- you don't really need the following script in a real example --> or we add this to the lib.
[10:01:41] * johnbender sighs
[10:01:51] <johnbender> toddmparker: ^
[10:01:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ^
[10:02:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We need your guidance oh fearless leader!
[10:03:30] <_|Nix|_> I'll add the comment to the example template for now.

[10:44:46] <toddmparker> i'm ok with switching now
[10:44:52] <toddmparker> no need to a big ta-da!
[10:45:02] <toddmparker> this only affects people looking at latest anyway
[10:45:28] <toddmparker> if someone has a link to /test/demos can we route them to a page?
[10:46:28] <gseguin> toddmparker: yes
[10:46:43] <toddmparker> cool
[10:46:51] <toddmparker> i'll make a page
[10:46:57] <gseguin> huh... I think so at least
[10:47:03] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ and johnbender - what's this business?
[10:47:12] <toddmparker> ff and frames oh my!
[10:47:27] <johnbender> toddmparker: the docs use iframes for the samples
[10:47:36] <johnbender> but as you would expect not all iframes behave properly
[10:47:52] <johnbender> so the question then is do we support iframes?
[10:48:09] <johnbender> I would say no
[10:48:16] <johnbender> but then it's odd to have them in the docs
[10:48:26] <johnbender> and "not support them"
[10:48:41] <toddmparker> i was ignoring iframe support for the most part, but we get complaints
[10:48:45] <johnbender> although it's still fairly reasonable because we're not building the docs to be viewed on mobile phones
[10:48:58] <toddmparker> now that this messes with our demos, i'm more interested in fixing it
[10:49:00] <johnbender> toddmparker: I don't think we should go down that rabbit hole
[10:49:04] <toddmparker> so what are our options?
[10:49:20] <johnbender> toddmparker: well _|Nix|_ has a script which handles the issue that is external to the library 
[10:49:26] <johnbender> but he wants to move that into the library
[10:49:34] <toddmparker> i like that better
[10:49:37] <toddmparker> (external)
[10:49:44] <johnbender> that's what I thought too
[10:49:55] <johnbender> but that just leaves us with the confusion over the docs
[10:50:04] <johnbender> because it appears to work in the iframes
[10:50:05] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: would you be willing to have that script be in a public repo so we can tell people how to use it if they want
[10:50:25] <toddmparker> right
[10:50:42] <toddmparker> how ugly is the workaround?
[10:51:00] <toddmparker> regardless, it's too late to add something like this to 1.3.0 imho
[10:51:21] <toddmparker> so i'd vote to keep it external and add a comment into those pages
[10:51:38] <toddmparker> we can also create a new Q&A page about frames and link to that repo
[10:52:04] <toddmparker> we can look at officially improving things in 1.4 to some degree
[11:00:54] <agcolom> toddmparker: Hi, sorry for disappearing yesterday.... my boiler was making a very crazy noise... It stopped working so no more heating and no more hot water :-(
[11:00:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, then I guess our current solution stays.
[11:01:26] <agcolom> I'll do those api docs updates this weekend.
[11:04:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I was thinking that if we make /test/ point to /demos/ now all links like /test/docs/forms/slider/ will be broken
[11:05:48] <uGoMobi> we can't redirect as long as we are on /test/
[11:07:12] <uGoMobi> what we can do is create a branch in which we prepare the migration to /demos/ folder... updating the build files etc
[11:07:27] <uGoMobi> I think then the branch preview should work
[11:09:14] <agcolom> uGoMobi: so the demo index will be at view.jquerymobile.com ?
[11:09:43] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:09:58] <agcolom> and that will happen this weekend or monday?
[11:10:48] <uGoMobi> switching from jquerymobile.com/test/ to view.jquerymobile.com won't happen before monday 
[11:11:28] <uGoMobi> there are two things in play... switching domain ^^^
[11:11:48] <uGoMobi> and switching to other folder... /docs/ --> /demos/
[11:12:04] <uGoMobi> that is the folder on branch master in the repo
[11:13:01] <agcolom> ok, I will get all ready on the api docs on sunday, and hopefully that will just work when the change is made... I won't have much time monday before quite late I think, so best for me to dget the links ready in advance :-)
[11:14:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: there will be a redirect so a link to jquerymobile.com/test/whateverfolderorfile will be redirected to view.jquerymobile.com (homepage)
[11:15:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What was that scenario where view source didn't work?
[11:15:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, NM. AJAX.
[11:17:32] <uGoMobi> yeah... or more precisely... no AJAX
[11:17:48] <_|Nix|_> Oh, crap! Popup doesn't work if AJAX is not enabled because you never get a pagebeforechange!
[11:18:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah arschmitz already mentioned that as cause
[11:18:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but how come that it does work if AJAX is disabled on a link instead of global?
[11:19:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Because if it's disabled on a link it's not disabled on the link that opens the popup.
[11:19:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah gotcha
[11:20:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: We could just bind to click instead
[11:20:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK ... I'll add a special case to the demos, but this is pretty serious ...
[11:20:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There was an issue with that - on Android, the click can end up hitting the screen and closing the popup immediately after it opens.
[11:20:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's why I wait until pagebeforechange.
[11:20:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see :(
[11:21:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so popups in general won't work if AJAX is disabled global?
[11:21:16] <_|Nix|_> Nopoe.
[11:21:18] <_|Nix|_> Nope.
[11:21:18] <toddmparker> that's not good
[11:21:21] <_|Nix|_> Nope.
[11:21:43] <toddmparker> that should be note in the api docs
[11:21:50] <toddmparker> and we should fix for 1.3.1
[11:21:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: For sure ...
[11:22:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and release 1.3.1 /real/ fast.
[11:22:12] <toddmparker> yep
[11:22:20] <toddmparker> is this a regression?
[11:22:26] <_|Nix|_> It may be.
[11:22:31] <_|Nix|_> Let's find out.
[11:22:38] <toddmparker> mind adding some tests for that?
[11:27:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Hmmm ... seems to work in 1.2.0 - maybe it is a regression.
[11:28:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Weird - it works in master as well - in the old docs.
[11:29:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK ... looks like it works with AJAX off just not in the demos.
[11:29:12] * _|Nix|_ scratches his head
[11:32:08] <agcolom> toddmparker: I've added some links on the index page: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/ (the links will work when I tag and make live)

[11:36:27] <_|Nix|_> OK ... the bug is in view-source ... the href for the button is wrong.
[11:36:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: glad to hear it's not in the framework
[11:37:27] <arschmitz>  
[11:37:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ... <a href="./" ... > O_o
[11:38:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: lol
[11:38:16] <_|Nix|_> I remember having a reason for doing that, but I don't remember what it was.
[11:38:29] <arschmitz> hey guys im back
[11:38:35] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[11:38:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey! Hope all's well with you and yours ...
[11:38:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what's the situation ?
[11:39:20] <arschmitz> it wasent as serious as my wife had been told
[11:39:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: *phew*
[11:39:32] <arschmitz> she fine they are not sure if it was a heart attack or something else
[11:39:35] <siovene> johnbender: ping
[11:39:38] <uGoMobi> yeah phew
[11:39:40] <arschmitz> but shes fine and just under observation
[11:39:56] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:40:31] <arschmitz> but yeah big relief 
[11:40:39] <uGoMobi> for sure
[11:40:48] <arschmitz> been a crazy couple weeks way too much time at hospital
[11:40:56] <uGoMobi> same hospital as your son?
[11:41:02] <arschmitz> yes
[11:41:38] <arschmitz> and my wifes father had been there from before she had the baby until this monday with phenumonia 
[11:41:59] <uGoMobi> geez
[11:42:14] <uGoMobi> maybe ask for an office in the hospital?
[11:42:23] <arschmitz> lol 
[11:42:31] <arschmitz> yeah they block irc there for some reason!
[11:42:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: D000d! That's rough! Hang in there - all of you!
[11:46:24] <arschmitz> thanks
[11:48:43] <uGoMobi> I created a branch "new-demos" I committed some changes there which prepare the move from /docs/ to /demos/
[11:48:46] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/378443f3340e131e45bd55504635a453904350c8
[11:49:17] <uGoMobi> can anyone with more knowledge of builds and servers take a look at that?
[11:49:46] <uGoMobi> I am curious if the branch preview will work
[11:50:34] <uGoMobi> the idea is that when we merge that branch in master and point /test/ to /demos/ instead of /docs/ everything will work
[11:50:35] <uGoMobi> :)
[11:51:55] <uGoMobi> the backup branch for the old docs is now "old-docs" instead of "backup-before-removing-docs"
[11:52:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/3473e2598c2046db15f9da22419001bb958f7da6/docs/demos/_assets/js/h2widget.js#L26 - surely that was meant to say $( ele ).attr( "href", f.originalHref ); - with the double quotes around href ...
[11:52:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: gseguin johnbender _|Nix|_ arschmitz ^^^
[11:53:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ROger that!
[11:53:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup yup
[11:53:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll fix it.
[11:53:32] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ok
[11:54:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that whole top link handleing is more or less a hack to make it work until i can actualy fix nav to handle on its own the proper way
[11:55:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's fine. This is a typo more than anything.
[11:55:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: lines 15-17 should be removed too
[11:55:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Why did this even work though? Where is href defined?
[11:56:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is it in some enclosing IIFE?
[11:56:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, there it is.
[11:56:16] <arschmitz> yup
[11:56:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... in some enclosing IIFE :)
[11:56:35] <arschmitz> then set in the original click
[11:56:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then I'm amazed it worked so far.
[11:57:10] <arschmitz> that only handles a certain case that does not really happen in docs
[11:57:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: An attributed named "#something" is not exactly valid - throws a DOM exception and everything :)
[11:57:14] <arschmitz> right now
[11:57:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I'll get rid of 15-17 as well.
[11:57:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: didnt cause problems because thats only for a link to an id on another page thats ajaxed in
[11:58:10] <arschmitz> which we dont currently do
[11:58:21] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: better name
[11:58:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: thought so :)
[11:58:42] <uGoMobi> I think I was inspired by _|Nix|_  ;)
[11:58:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: as far as i can see your branch looks good
[11:59:05] <arschmitz> im not a build expert though
[11:59:38] <uGoMobi> neither am I
[11:59:44] <uGoMobi> thanks for looking at it

[11:59:54] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 146785815 15Gabriel Schulhof: Demos: h2widget: Fix typo and remove a pbc handler
[12:01:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I fixed it by setting the href to #demoPopup which is not really an ID that exists, but the pbc handler will get the link that was clicked and will find the data necessary for creating the popup attached to the link.
[12:02:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think setting the href to # didn't work because the click handler short-circuits.
[12:02:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: didn't I add an ID to the popup?
[12:03:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono. I got rid of that. There's a .jqmData() item associated with the view source button now, because the popup is generated at click-time.
[12:03:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, having an ID is not useful.
[12:04:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was wrong, I added a class recently, not an ID
[12:04:29] <_|Nix|_> OOps ... that previous commit was accidentally -a instead of specific files ...

[12:16:24] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 146775532 15Alexander Schmitz: Demos: remove f.originalHref as it is not needed
[12:17:44] <uGoMobi> he he ... it seems to work... http://jquerymobile.com/branches/new-demos/index.html
[12:20:03] <uGoMobi> only the home links don't work
[12:20:57] <uGoMobi> correction... only the homelink in the panel menu doesn't work
[12:21:04] <uGoMobi> the ones in the header are ok
[12:21:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that could be an issue
[12:22:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you cant tell from a branch
[12:22:08] <uGoMobi> all links in panel start with basetag 
[12:22:10] <arschmitz> branches are not built
[12:22:25] <arschmitz> you go mobie the panel widget defines a base folder
[12:22:36] <arschmitz> so that just needs to be updated
[12:23:29] <arschmitz> right now that folder is demos but its a simple regex that finds first occurance
[12:23:40] <arschmitz> so its seeing new-demos
[12:23:48] <arschmitz> and useing that as base folder
[12:23:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I mean the script takes the part before /demos/ from the basetag and adds the path from the href
[12:25:04] <uGoMobi> I think I changed the href of the link to home... it was href="" and I think I changed it to href="../"
[12:25:26] <uGoMobi> I shouldn't have done that I think
[12:25:56] <uGoMobi> it should stay "" and then the redirect will bring you to the homepage
[12:26:15] <arschmitz> you go mobie you cant use ..
[12:26:36] <arschmitz> right now anyway
[12:26:51] <arschmitz> the way to do this now is make all links relative to root
[12:27:09] <arschmitz> ill take care of it lol
[12:30:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually there is nothing to take care of lol
[12:30:47] <arschmitz> once its not in a folder named new-demos it will work fine
[12:31:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think I only need to revert that change I made in nav.html
[12:31:20] <uGoMobi> not sure though
[12:31:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right now none of the nav panel links work
[12:31:48] <arschmitz> in your branch
[12:32:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its becasue it looks for the first occurance of demos in url
[12:32:15] <arschmitz> so the new-demos folder is messing with it
[12:32:20] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:32:55] <arschmitz> i can fix and make it look only for /demos/
[12:33:10] <arschmitz> but once its in test or any branch with out the word demo it will work fine
[12:33:34] <uGoMobi> I am not good at picking branch names :)
[12:33:42] <arschmitz> lol its fine
[12:33:53] <arschmitz> and i was wrong
[12:33:59] <arschmitz> .. is fine for home link
[12:34:11] <arschmitz> or to use in general it works as expected
[12:34:32] <arschmitz> i thought the widget might mangle it but it does not
[12:34:32] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:34:57] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: so new demos are in a branch now?
[12:35:07] <toddmparker> sorry, i dropped off for a few, catching up
[12:35:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes
[12:35:29] <toddmparker> so master doesn't have the demos now, just this branch
[12:35:37] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/new-demos/
[12:35:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: they are still on master
[12:36:07] <toddmparker> so this branch is just for previewing?
[12:36:09] <uGoMobi> we can also keep making changes in master
[12:36:10] <toddmparker> for now
[12:36:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes, I made changes to build scripts and wanted to test that
[12:36:33] <toddmparker> cool
[12:36:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: branches are not built
[12:37:04] <arschmitz> they are straight git repo
[12:37:08] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ohw
[12:37:38] <uGoMobi> hmm
[12:37:41] <arschmitz> yeah only test is built
[12:38:23] <uGoMobi> well I didn't want to commit my changed to master so needed a branch anyway :)
[12:38:36] <arschmitz> yeah it just wont help with build
[12:38:38] <uGoMobi> and at least we can see them online
[12:38:43] <arschmitz> to test that you would have to build it localy
[12:38:50] <uGoMobi> what isn't possible on master
[12:38:52] <arschmitz> it also tests the links
[12:38:59] <uGoMobi> ah good idea
[12:39:07] <uGoMobi> I can do a local build from that branch
[12:39:19] <arschmitz> yup :)
[12:39:38] <arschmitz> lol im working on learning about the build stuff starting to get there :)
[12:39:49] <uGoMobi> great
[12:40:25] <arschmitz> figure its good to try and learn as much about all the different pieces as possible for project
[12:40:37] <uGoMobi> it is
[12:40:51] <arschmitz> and just for my own knowledge of course too
[12:42:53] <uGoMobi> hmm... the build is not a success
[12:44:06] <uGoMobi> but I see some helpful error messages
[12:49:57] <toddmparker> trial by fire, best way to learn
