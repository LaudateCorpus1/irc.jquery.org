[05:22:08] <jqm-jenkins-bot> coloma: Update docs/forms/selects/index.html
[08:26:29] <jzaefferer> hey guys
[08:26:46] <jzaefferer> what's the state of the art on responsive images? is this still the way to go? https://github.com/filamentgroup/Responsive-Images (last commit in July..)
[08:27:17] <jzaefferer> Wilto, toddmparker_: would appreciate some recommendations
[08:28:11] <Wilto> jzaefferer: Pull up a chair; this could take a couple hours.
[08:30:35] <Wilto> In short: all the techniques in play nowadays have been broken by asset prefetching in the newest versions of the modern browsers.
[08:31:11] <jzaefferer> oh nice
[08:31:13] <Wilto> But, they are broken in a way where they still work, just not as well as they could.
[08:31:50] <Wilto> As a stop-gap—and I am not advocating this—the only current solution is something server-side. And I don’t have to tell you how that would determine what size image to serve up.
[08:31:52] <jzaefferer> Well, I'm targetting mobile and table browsers for now, nothing beyond that. Does that help?
[08:32:49] <jzaefferer> No JS based solutions? Load small image, check dimensions via JS, load bigger one in place?
[08:32:56] <Wilto> Oh, there is.
[08:33:05] <Wilto> When I say “broken,” it’s me being a perfectionist.
[08:33:22] <Wilto> It still WORKS, you just end up with two requests and a weird flash of the mobile-sized image first.
[08:33:39] <Wilto> The Globe is doing that now, and it’s totally passable.
[08:33:49] <Wilto> Not ideal, but not like “hold everything, this is broken.”
[08:33:59] <jzaefferer> so on small/mobile, its okay, just flashing on bigger ones?
[08:35:14] <Wilto> Yep.
[08:35:47] <Wilto> There has been a great deal of discussion, and the general consensus has pretty much landed on “we need a new element.”
[08:35:52] <Wilto> Who knows how that will play out.
[08:36:25] <jzaefferer> is there a js-based lib I could take that doesn't require serverside rewrites?
[08:36:37] <jzaefferer> not sure if this project can deal with apache configs...
[08:36:54] <Wilto> Oh, yeah. Plus side: that’s the part that breaks.
[08:37:06] <Wilto> So you could use https://github.com/filamentgroup/Responsive-Images without the server side stuff.
[08:38:02] <Wilto> So, that sets a cookie to be included with the image requests, and when .htaccess sees it, it swaps the requested image for a 1x1 gif to prevent the flash (and while it’s still two requests, it’s a tiny one that’s cached right away).
[08:38:22] <Wilto> Then JS swaps the 1x1 gif for the data-fullsrc path.
[08:38:33] <Wilto> You’d just tear out everything but the last step.
[08:39:54] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[08:40:37] <jzaefferer> thank Wilto, I'll dig into that a bit
[08:40:48] <Wilto> Speakin’ of, you don’t know anyone that works within the HTML Powers That Be that I could harass about said new element, do you?
[08:41:14] <jzaefferer> nope
[08:41:15] <Wilto> Because that is a big ask, so I wanna be strategic about bringing it up. Firing off an email to someone I’ve never met seems like a bad move.
[08:41:18] <Wilto> Damn.
[08:42:03] <jzaefferer> my one attempt to get involved in the standards process wasn't a disaster, but it also didn't get anywhere
[08:42:07] <jzaefferer> mostly got ignored, not yelled at
[08:42:34] <jzaefferer> colleagues at SoundCloud built this testsuite for HTML5 audio, that seems to do a pretty good job of reaching the right people: http://areweplayingyet.com/
[08:42:48] <jzaefferer> but thats mostly testing implementations of an existing standard, not trying to create a new one
[08:43:19] <Wilto> Yeah. I’m wondering if I don’t just have to get ahold of someone who hacks on browsers and having them implement a working prototype first.
[08:43:28] <Wilto> Like “look, this works. Let’s do this.”
[08:44:11] <Wilto> And the plan is to more-or-less follow the <video> source fallback scheme, but with the inclusion of a new “media” attribute.
[08:44:16] <Wilto> It’s… Not an easy sell.
[08:44:37] <jzaefferer> yeah...
[08:44:48] <jzaefferer> maybe ping some Opera dev relations?
[08:45:05] <jzaefferer> miketaylr is even hanging our here, and you know Divya...
[08:45:22] <Wilto> …Oh ho.
[08:45:57] <jzaefferer> though I'm still waiting for the getUserMedia("audio") prototype :/
[08:46:25] <Wilto> I’m starting to think I might be better off just sending a letter to Santa.
[08:46:35] <miketaylr> jzaefferer: yeah the guy i emailed never responded >:|
[08:47:14] <Wilto> I dunno if this is public yet, but I’m writing an article for A List Apart about responsive images.
[08:47:14] <miketaylr> Wilto: i think emailing the whatwg first is way better than getting someone to implement something
[08:47:19] <Wilto> I’m hoping that gets some attention.
[08:50:01] <Wilto> I dunno, miketaylr. I feel like I wanna get some WHATWG-involved parties on my side first.
[08:50:15] <miketaylr> so... ask them?
[08:50:19] <Wilto> Otherwise, I’m some kid they’ve never heard of saying “I want a new element because I can use it.”
[08:50:34] <miketaylr> i get that
[08:50:44] <Wilto> They must get ten of those a day.
[08:50:45] <miketaylr> but present a long-ass list of use cases, and a proposal
[08:50:51] <Wilto> BRING DATAGRID BACK
[08:50:58] <miketaylr> it's shelved
[08:51:02] <Wilto> NOOO
[08:51:08] <Wilto> (I couldn’t be more okay with that.)
[08:51:10] <miketaylr> (meaning it will come back)
[08:51:14] <Wilto> what
[08:51:16] <miketaylr> (in the year 2000)
[08:51:24] <miketaylr> but not in HTMl5
[08:51:25] <Wilto> wat
[08:52:47] <Wilto> Despite websites I’ve worked on and helped launch this week, I’m not as involved in standards as I oughta be. I’ll get on some lists and learn the lay of the land before pestering anyone, at least.
[08:53:15] <miketaylr> i guess i just think it's not optimal to go build experimental backroom features without discussion from the people you're trying to get to implement it too
[08:53:24] <miketaylr> but yeah, it can suck to have someone say "No."
[08:53:30] <Wilto> Gotcha.
[08:53:36] <Wilto> You know better than I do, holmes.
[08:53:47] <miketaylr> #whatwg irc is a good place to bounce around ideas too
[08:54:10] <Wilto> Yeah. I just want to present this in a way where it’s not just some dude throwing an idea out there, but show that there’s a clear and present demand.
[08:54:37] <Wilto> I think the ALA thing is pretty much gonna be my proposal.
[08:54:39] <miketaylr> +1
[08:55:19] <Wilto> Else I will just threaten to beat up the entirety of the standards bodies.
[08:55:38] <Wilto> _Project kid diplomacy._
[08:55:39] <miketaylr> violence is the next logical step
[08:55:44] <Wilto> Always, miketaylr. Always.
[08:55:57] <miketaylr> more like Punches Welcome amirite
[08:56:05] * miketaylr groans
[08:56:08] * miketaylr gets back to writing
[08:57:07] <Wilto> ?hi5

[09:44:01] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3203 on jquery-mobile, reported by indyEssl (10h, 7m ago): Symbian v3 is not jquery mobile ready
[10:19:21] <Wilto> So tempted to respond “your FACE is not jQuery Mobile ready.”
[10:19:27] <Wilto> Because I am a professional adult.
[10:19:56] <Wilto> Huh. That’s an interesting one.

[10:28:20] <kinblas> Wilto: lol
[10:31:37] <TehShrike|Work> Wilto: you should be in PR
[10:38:12] <Wilto> Right!?
[10:41:29] <TehShrike|Work> :-D
[10:41:43] <TehShrike|Work> Hard to find good PR for projects
[10:41:57] <TehShrike|Work> Dreamhost does a great job, as does Woot
[10:42:12] <TehShrike|Work> And Paul from Mode 7 Games puts out awesome press releases
[10:42:27] <TehShrike|Work> You should join their ranks as a PR person who writes things people actually want to read :-)
[10:54:04] <Wilto> Hah. I am shockingly bad at 140-plus character writing.
[11:00:23] <Wilto> Hey, just thought of something: we’re using an animation for the little loader spinner, yeah?
[11:55:07] <garann> that discussion about branches yesterday was theoretical, right?
[11:55:16] <garann> just occurred to me i was unsure of the resolution..
[11:55:25] <garann> and i made a pull request against the catch-all branch
[11:56:26] <gseguin> Wilto: do we need to create a branch for garann's changes?
[12:02:48] <Wilto> I think it’s a good idea, yeah. That stuff is pretty self-contained.
[12:03:54] <Wilto> We should name dialog-refactor or whatever I called it to, like, “experiental features” or “mat-and-todds-buckwild-brainstorm-branch” or “rainbow-rumpus-party-towne” or something.
[12:05:59] <garann> man, i think i was in the wrong branch anyway
[12:06:12] <garann> sorry you guys, i didn't mean to make a mess
[12:06:33] <garann> anyway, the position:fixed stuff is ready, just let me know where you want it, i guess?
[12:29:35] <Wilto> Nah, no worries—I do that constantly.
[12:30:45] <Wilto> In fact, uh, I’m leaving the branch changes to someone else. kinblas, are you around?
[12:34:54] <kinblas> Wilto: yeah
[12:35:21] <Wilto> Basically: help.
[12:35:47] <kinblas> Wilto: you need help?
[12:36:01] <kinblas> ... of the technological variety that is ...
[12:36:15] <Wilto> Yes, and also help of the technological variety.
[12:36:34] <Wilto> garann: Were you working on master, or on the experimental branch?
[12:37:04] <toddmparker_> kinblas: see this thread about scrolling perf
[12:37:05] <toddmparker_> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/why-jqm-touchscreen-list-scrolling-performance-stinks-and-what-to-do-about-it#14737000002899364
[12:37:33] <Wilto> kinblas: I might need a hand moving some git stuff around, if you’ve got a little time.
[12:37:57] <garann> Wilto: somehow i was in data-templating-callback
[12:37:59] <Wilto> When it comes to moving and renaming branches, my go-to approach of Googling how to do it and pasting things into terminal may not be the best idea.
[12:38:15] <garann> well.. not "somehow," i know exactly how..
[12:38:23] <garann> anyway, definitely the wrong place
[12:39:47] <kinblas> Wilto: ok, give me a sec, I'm reading the book toddmparker just lobbed at me
[12:40:20] <Wilto> Ditto.
[12:42:33] <garann> Wilto: i am going to close this existing pull request, ok?
[12:42:33] <kinblas> toddmparker: so I don't get his claim that we are constantly flipping styles?
[12:42:52] <kinblas> we flip on the down and on the up ... period
[12:42:54] <Wilto> garann: I’d keep it open; maybe we can pull that into a specific branch or something?
[12:43:19] <garann> oh, ok, if you think so
[12:45:02] <toddmparker_> garann - you could even drop it into the dialog refactor branch for now
[12:45:04] <kinblas> Wilto: didn't you have some pointer to a doc that explained the differences between an URL launched from the desktop (whatever you call it on ios) and mobile safari?
[12:45:14] <toddmparker_> it's just an experiment to see if we want to go forward
[12:45:26] <garann> toddmparker_: sure, i can do that
[12:45:32] <garann> and delete the existing pull request?
[12:45:39] <Wilto> Every time I see someone suggesting a “simple workaround” for something jQM-related, I am overwhelmed with the urge to flip a table.
[12:45:40] <toddmparker_> if it easy to just drop your updates file or two into that branch, seems like a good start
[12:45:51] <toddmparker_> why didn't we think of this??
[12:46:55] <Wilto> kinblas: Like, a homescreen’d site vs. one just open in Safari?
[12:47:01] <Wilto> Running in a webview?
[12:47:04] <kinblas> rogjt
[12:47:05] <kinblas> right
[12:47:29] <Wilto> Pre-5.0 I think webviews used an older version of the JS engine.
[12:47:36] <Wilto> (read: slower)
[12:47:40] <Wilto> But that should be about all.
[12:48:40] <kinblas> Wilto: ok there wasn't anything to do with GPU acceleration?
[12:48:50] <Wilto> Nooot that I recall.
[12:49:12] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so the guy made it sound like you guys had a conversation? Where was that done? On the forum (what article) or in an issue?
[12:49:25] <Wilto> I think the JS difference was only that it was still beta-y, and they weren’t sure it would work well within webviews within apps, y’know?
[12:49:52] <toddmparker_> maybe it was a comment on a issue or forum Q?
[12:51:27] <Wilto> This is why we need to get Todd an agent.
[12:52:06] <Wilto> Or legal counsel. “My client has no comment on listview performance at this time. No photographs, please.”
[13:15:02] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I replied
[13:15:22] <toddmparker_> yeah? cool
[13:15:36] <toddmparker_> i was going to try and test this, but i feel like i already did
[13:20:34] <toddmparker_> thanks kin. i replied too and asked for test pages.
[13:21:21] <toddmparker_> i do wonder if we want to toggle the hover state on lists because when you scroll with touch, it is distracting and may slow perf
[13:23:37] <kinblas> toddmparker_: you can touch anything and trigger a scroll
[13:23:43] <kinblas> so do we want to back off of touch events?
[13:23:58] <kinblas> ... except for slider of course ...
[13:24:31] <toddmparker_> i'm mainly thinking about listsspecifically
[13:24:43] <toddmparker_> i.e. if we need to have them. most os don't
[13:24:58] <toddmparker_> maybe we can use outline for keyboard/focus based navigation
[13:25:14] <toddmparker_> we still need the down > active stuff on lists
[13:26:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: but that is mostly what he's complaining about
[13:26:27] <kinblas> it really is anything that causes the browser to re-render
[13:26:31] <kinblas> that slows things down
[13:27:57] <toddmparker_> but if we don't add hover, doesn't that lessen the issue? you only re-render when you tap and at that point scolling isn't an issue
[13:34:08] <garann> should be correct now: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3211
[13:34:09] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by garann (1m ago): Made fixed header and footer CSS-only
[13:37:13] <kinblas> Wilto: so what was that help you needed?
[13:37:26] <Wilto> Oh, just general repo-sorting.
[13:38:09] <Wilto> I think garann’s stuf is going into dialog-refactor as well, and I’m doing the AJAX stuff in there—how hard is it to rename that to, like… “experimental-features” or something?
[13:38:16] <Wilto> If it’s a pain in the ass, no need.
[13:41:11] <toddmparker_> so kinblas back on our list perf conversation...
[13:41:55] <kinblas> Wilto: I think you can just branch what you have to another branch and push that
[13:42:14] <Wilto> Inception-y.
[13:45:50] <kinblas> toddmparker_: uh huh?
[13:51:02] <toddmparker_> sorry, so i was wondering if removing hover would make a diff. or if it's us binding to any events that kills perf
[13:51:55] <toddmparker_> ...which we need for AJAX nav anyway, regardless of button states
[14:15:29] <kinblas> toddmparker: it's both
[14:15:42] <kinblas> it wouldn't make a difference because we're still causing a visual change on the down
[15:05:13] <toddmparker_> garann - just pulled that in...the fixed toolbars look great in ios5
[15:09:40] <garann> oh good!
[15:09:52] <garann> i have an droid phone in the office i can test with on monday if that helps
[15:10:03] <garann> an android, that is
[15:18:04] <toddmparker_> sorry, was off testing
[15:18:08] <toddmparker_> so this is encouraging!
[15:18:30] <toddmparker_> looks fantastic on iOS5, Android 2.3, Honeycomb, etc.
[15:18:42] <toddmparker_> A few things for you to look at garann
[15:20:23] <toddmparker_> 1. There seems to be some z-indexing issues but it's consistent across browsers. list items, form elements, etc. slide over the toolbars
[15:32:39] <garann> toddmparker_: i'll look at the z-index - any others?
