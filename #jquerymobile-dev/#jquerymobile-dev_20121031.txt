[03:46:09] <subdesign> hi
[03:47:44] <subdesign> can you help me why one of my jqm page hasnt the same pagination design as others, when the html code is 100% the same for it?
[03:48:28] <subdesign> can be jqm related?
[03:56:13] <uGoMobi> hi subdesign - you can ask for help with that on the forum https://forum.jquery.com/jquery-mobile and the #jquerymobile channel
[03:56:51] <subdesign> thx
[03:57:07] <uGoMobi> yw
[03:58:25] <subdesign> hehe i thought u a bot :) ok
[04:01:13] <uGoMobi> :/
[05:05:48] <arschmitz> aww uGoMobi they thought you were a bot :(
[05:05:58] <uGoMobi> bleep bleep
[05:06:05] <_|Nix|_> The reverse Turing test :)
[05:06:08] <uGoMobi> :)
[05:29:57] <arschmitz> oh uGoMobi: ps your the man! -webkit-transform:translate3d(0,0,0); did the trick!
[05:30:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: seriously?
[05:30:20] <arschmitz> yup
[05:30:28] <uGoMobi> :D
[05:30:49] <uGoMobi> for what element did you set it?
[05:31:37] <arschmitz> .ui-li-has-thumb
[05:32:01] <arschmitz> so the li
[05:32:36] <arschmitz> 100% perfect it seems like its improved the overall responsiveness of the other buttons too honestly
[05:40:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that is because it enables hardware acceleration
[05:40:29] <uGoMobi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9068132/why-arent-browsers-smart-enough-to-hardware-accelerate-without-tricks
[05:40:35] <uGoMobi> http://www.sencha.com/blog/understanding-hardware-acceleration-on-mobile-browsers/
[05:42:12] <arschmitz> Nice so im going through the fixed toolbar issues and it looks like i think this and workarounds will close 7 of the 15 open tickets!
[05:42:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that sounds good :)
[05:44:21] <uGoMobi> I think it is safe to use this but might be good to ask toddmparker Wilto and scottjehl__ if there can be downsides
[05:44:46] <arschmitz> yeah i will when they get in
[05:44:52] <uGoMobi> cool
[05:54:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Have a minute to take a look at my workarounds extension?
[05:54:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[05:55:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/blob/workarounds/js/widgets/fixedToolbarWorkarounds.js
[05:57:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok I take a look
[05:59:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Thanks make sure i didnt do anything stupid before everyone else looks ha ha ha
[05:59:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: don't worry :)
[06:00:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Ha HA thanks i think its pretty solid though might be a better way to do the browser detection
[06:32:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: at first glance the code looks good to me
[06:32:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/blob/workarounds/js/widgets/fixedToolbarWorkarounds.js#L4
[06:33:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Sweet
[06:33:49] <arschmitz> 'something up with line 4?
[06:33:59] <uGoMobi> not sure if you can use same name (first parameter) there... $.widget( "mobile.fixedtoolbar", $.mobile.fixedtoolbar, {
[06:34:42] <uGoMobi> but to be honest I don't really know what is the way to go to extend a widget
[06:35:16] <arschmitz> i got that from the jquery ui 1.9 upgrade guide that johnbender: sent me for extending
[06:36:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#allow-redefining-widgets-to-create-extensions
[06:36:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, then it should be fine
[06:36:23] <arschmitz> so i "think" thats right
[06:36:37] <arschmitz> im sure johnbender: will notice if its not ha ha
[06:37:13] <uGoMobi> haha yeah for sure
[06:37:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Thanks for taking a look though i appreciate it
[06:38:11] <uGoMobi> something else I was thinking about is how to prevent we do UA sniffing twice
[06:38:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i thought about that
[06:39:03] <uGoMobi> first we create the blacklist https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/blob/workarounds/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L31
[06:39:24] <uGoMobi> and then we do it again for workarounds https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/blob/workarounds/js/widgets/fixedToolbarWorkarounds.js#L13
[06:39:27] <arschmitz> couldnt think of a way to keep them seperate but work together.
[06:39:46] <arschmitz> i supose i could redefine the blacklist
[06:40:24] <arschmitz> and move the sniffing into its own function
[06:40:38] <arschmitz> and pass the results to the redefined blacklist
[06:41:26] <arschmitz> a bit more complicated but removes the duplicate code
[06:41:29] <uGoMobi> yeah something like that
[06:41:58] <arschmitz> ill work something up it shouldnt take long
[06:42:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you already add the CSS in your repo for classes like ui-ios-footer-fix?
[06:44:11] <arschmitz> yes
[06:44:33] <arschmitz> its just position:fixed; bottom:0;
[06:45:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, I see it now
[06:45:33] <arschmitz> cool
[06:45:48] <uGoMobi> too many tabs open... was looking at the wrong repo ;-)
[06:46:41] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah im terrible for that i always have WAY to many tabs open
[06:52:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this might sound like nitpicking ;-) but can you add spaces before the { and after the : in the CSS
[06:52:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: of course i dont considder it nitpicking at all consistancy is important
[06:53:38] <uGoMobi> yeah it is
[06:53:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: anyway... nice work!
[06:54:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Thank you will be exciting to close all those tickets ! ha ha
[06:55:11] <uGoMobi> oh yeah definitely
[06:55:33] <uGoMobi> I think I should make sure I have a bottle of champagne in the house :)
[06:57:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ha ha yeah clean up some old ugly bugs
[06:58:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: honestly im suprised to have found workable solutions for so many of them.
[08:29:26] <toddmparker> Good morning!
[08:29:54] <arschmitz> toddmparker: morning
[08:31:51] <toddmparker> hey arschmitz
[08:32:07] <toddmparker> just catching up…seems like you are very close to finishing the extension?
[08:32:21] <toddmparker> btw - doesn't -webkit-transform:translate3d(0,0,0); change the positioning context?
[08:33:04] <arschmitz> to be honest im not sure
[08:33:10] <toddmparker> think all child elements are relative
[08:33:21] <toddmparker> or was that back face?
[08:33:35] <toddmparker> worth testing to see if thinks look wonky
[08:33:38] <toddmparker> might be ok
[08:33:58] <arschmitz> i tried it and everything i checked looked ok
[08:34:07] <toddmparker> I know with touch overflow, we had to add a translate to force rendering of elements inside the overflow regions
[08:34:08] <arschmitz> and there were absolute positioned children
[08:34:15] <toddmparker> and it messed with all the positioning
[08:34:50] <arschmitz> i see
[08:35:09] <toddmparker> but we were doing that on most of the page
[08:35:16] <toddmparker> this is just inside a listview?
[08:35:29] <toddmparker> not sure of the use case here
[08:35:42] <arschmitz> in the case of 4250 where uGoMobi: and i were discussing it its only on .ui-li-has thumb and its didnt change anything i could see
[08:36:06] <toddmparker> so it's added to list items
[08:36:09] <toddmparker> might be fine there
[08:36:14] <arschmitz> yes that have thumbnails
[08:36:21] <toddmparker> all depends on what you're doing style-wise
[08:37:09] <arschmitz> it also seems to fix  3748
[08:38:54] <arschmitz> the fix seems to simply be .ui-li-has-thumb {  -webkit-transform:translate3d(0,0,0); } (i dont think anything else uses this class so i didnt get more specific)
[08:41:16] <arschmitz> i tested on ios5 ios6 android 2.3.7 and a variety of emulators
[08:42:11] <arschmitz> that reminds me if you want to add it to your list of test devices i got a HTC Thunderbolt with 2.3.7
[08:47:38] <arschmitz> Wilto: need some of your awesome css input!
[08:47:57] <Wilto> WHO SUMMONS WILTO (thunderclap)
[08:48:15] <arschmitz> potential unwanted side effects of  -webkit-transform:translate3d(0,0,0);?
[08:48:40] <Wilto> `position: relative` and hardware accelleration.
[08:48:47] <Wilto> acceleration*
[08:48:54] <Wilto> Which is good in some places, and way worse in others.
[08:49:17] <arschmitz> setting it on .ui-li-has-thumb seems to fix several issues
[08:49:27] <Wilto> —Huh.
[08:49:30] <Wilto> Where’s this bug?
[08:49:40] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4250
[08:50:27] <arschmitz> the absolute positioned image causes issues with the nav bar buttons not fireing their click events
[08:50:36] <Wilto> Oh—this.
[08:50:48] <Wilto> Inherent dimensions are fine, all else breaks, yeah?
[08:50:56] <arschmitz> i wish :(
[08:51:15] <arschmitz> on buttons that overlap
[08:51:30] <arschmitz> only the actual overlapping part of the button register click
[08:52:00] <arschmitz> so if i make the image bigger so it like overlaps half a button taping on the overlapping half owrks fine non overlapping half nothing
[08:52:36] <arschmitz> also making the image relative vs absolute fixes
[08:52:44] <arschmitz> or removing the search filter fixes
[08:52:53] <arschmitz> or scrolling the page fixes
[08:52:58] <Wilto> Friggin’ Android.
[08:53:30] <arschmitz> but translating seems to not visually change anything execpt navbars responds
[08:54:10] <Wilto> That might be because it’s creating a new positioning context.
[08:54:21] <Wilto> Not so much the translate itself.
[08:54:25] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:54:34] <Wilto> Try this, just for the hell of it:
[08:54:53] <Wilto> .ui-li-has-thumb, .ui-li-has-thumb * { position: relative; }
[08:55:06] <Wilto> Somewhere before the other positioning styles are kicked in as usual, so we’re not overriding them.
[08:55:25] <arschmitz> ok give me just a sec
[08:55:49] <Wilto> Probably gonna break the layout, but y’know.
[08:56:28] <arschmitz> lol
[08:57:00] <arschmitz> dosent break the layout
[08:57:08] <arschmitz> but dosent work to fix the issue either
[08:58:59] <Wilto> Hm.
[08:59:58] <arschmitz> so i guess the question is do you forsee .ui-li-has-thumb {  -webkit-transform:translate3d(0,0,0); } breaking anything or causing any other issues?
[09:02:50] <Wilto> Ugh, man, I hate kicking in hardware acceleration for that reason…
[09:02:56] <Wilto> Is it only with translate3d?
[09:03:01] <toddmparker> if it checks out in our demos and with popular browsers might be ok
[09:03:16] <Wilto> Yeah; I mean, whatever works.
[09:03:18] <toddmparker> but this could mess with custom list view styles people have added
[09:03:29] <toddmparker> so we should add this to the upgrade guide for 1.3
[09:03:35] <toddmparker> mind creating a wiki page for that?
[09:04:01] <Wilto> Well, I still wanna ty a couple things; arschmitz, you feel like you’ve exhausted all other CSS voodoo options, here?
[09:04:19] <arschmitz> anything uGoMobi or i could come up with yeah
[09:04:54] <arschmitz> http://bit.ly/TXtnlZ is a link to it with the rule added
[09:04:58] <arschmitz> well to the docs
[09:05:40] <Wilto> Hm.
[09:07:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: Wilto: only other thing i could come up with to not dramaticly change anything was to change the images to relative and adjust the link padding accordingly
[09:07:26] <arschmitz> but thats a lot more breaking of a change!
[09:08:06] <Wilto> And if you let the image rely on inherent dimensions (not setting them at all in CSS, including `auto`), it doesn’t fix this?
[09:08:17] <Wilto> This sounds a lot like that weird-ass fixed header issue I ran into way back when.
[09:09:14] <arschmitz> let me double check on that because the images in the docs are 160px wide which makes them completely overlap the issue button
[09:09:26] <arschmitz> let me swap one out for an 80px image and re test
[09:12:52] <Wilto> Cool.
[09:16:10] <arschmitz> no dice
[09:16:21] <arschmitz> native size dosent do anything
[09:17:25] <Wilto> Man.
[09:18:06] <arschmitz> and the bug renders one of the nav bar buttons comletely inoperable so for usability its kinda major
[09:18:42] <arschmitz> ANDROID!!!!
[09:22:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker: as far as the extension its done was just looking into a way to not duplicate the browser sniffing was hoping to get some input on that today

[09:54:17] <johnbender> toddmparker: was the cabal last week?
[09:57:48] <arschmitz> johnbender: Hi, when you have a minute i was hoping to get your feedback on the workarounds extension to fixedToolbars iv been working on
[10:01:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: sure thing
[10:01:36] <Wilto> Sorry; back.
[10:01:36] <johnbender> arschmitz: link?
[10:01:59] <Wilto> Alright arschmitz, I say “ship it.”
[10:02:01] <arschmitz> https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/blob/workarounds/js/widgets/fixedToolbarWorkarounds.js
[10:02:24] <arschmitz> Wilto: the fix for 4250?
[10:02:34] <Wilto> Yeah.
[10:02:45] <Wilto> Plan that sucker for the next version, though.
[10:02:52] <Wilto> toddmparker: Agreed? ^
[10:03:10] <arschmitz> johnbender: specificly if you have a good idea to not duplicate the browser sniffing it would be really helpfull
[10:04:18] <arschmitz> Wilto: yeah he suggested starting a 1.3 upgrade guide in the wiki with this in it so ill do that when i do the PR
[10:04:32] <Wilto> Yep, +1.
[10:04:59] <arschmitz> Wilto: id also love your feedback on https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/blob/workarounds/js/widgets/fixedToolbarWorkarounds.js
[10:05:17] <arschmitz> Wilto: the extension we discussed last week
[10:06:04] <Wilto> This is scottjehl__ territory, too.
[10:06:35] <arschmitz> Wilto: yeah i was going to ask him to just havent seen him around
[10:07:51] <uGoMobi> hi all
[10:13:48] <arschmitz> Anyone our there im trying to come up with the common problems people run into using JQM the things you see people doing wrong over and over. or just problems they run into a lot.
[10:13:59] <Wilto> arschmitz, johnbender: I’m for this approach to fixed toolbars.
[10:14:04] <arschmitz> its for a talk at jquery asia.
[10:15:03] <arschmitz> Wilto: Thank you for looking!
[10:33:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: very nice
[10:33:54] <arschmitz> johnbender: thank you.
[10:35:03] <johnbender> Wilto: arschmitz: toddmparker: scottjehl__: where did we land with this
[10:35:15] <arschmitz> johnbender: anythoughts on combining the browser sniffing. i had initally left the two because i didnt want to mess with supportblacklist but uGoMobi: thought it would be best to try and combine which i cant argue with
[10:35:16] <johnbender> is this something we'll include as an optional plugin or something we link to on the website and in the issue
[10:35:51] <arschmitz> johnbender: if im not mistaken it was decided by toodmparker to include by default
[10:35:55] <johnbender> arschmitz: not sure what you mean. Combine it with the existing browser sniffing?
[10:36:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: cool
[10:36:16] <arschmitz> just to make it an extension to keep the actual widget clean of browser specific stuff
[10:36:26] <johnbender> arschmitz: you'll need meta data like the other modules so that it shows up in the builder properly
[10:36:51] <arschmitz> yeah i wanted to ask about that im not familier with that stuff
[10:37:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: and I would stack the dependency list so it doesn't run off the right side
[10:37:07] <johnbender> arschmitz: you can just steal it from another modules
[10:37:10] <johnbender> *module
[10:37:26] <arschmitz> ok
[10:37:56] <johnbender> arschmitz: ah, so without the browser sniffing it would be applied everywhere
[10:38:05] <johnbender> and with the browser sniffing it would only be applied where necessary
[10:38:11] <arschmitz> johnbender: right
[10:38:13] <johnbender> that is, if the browser sniffing extension module was included
[10:38:16] <johnbender> hmm
[10:38:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi: what was your thinking there
[10:38:35] <arschmitz> but it duplicates a big chunk of supportblacklist in _workarounds
[10:38:40] <johnbender> ah
[10:38:56] <Wilto> I mean, I hate what we gotta do here, but… we also gotta do it, and this is as good a way as any.
[10:38:59] <Wilto> Sanity++
[10:39:30] <arschmitz> Wilto: yeah i just didnt want to mess with support blacklist which is why i kept seperate to start
[10:40:43] <uGoMobi> johnbender: like arschmitz said... I suggested to see if we could avoid duplication
[10:41:57] <johnbender> uGoMobi: do we have these checks anywhere else?
[10:42:13] <johnbender> is it time to try and centralize our browser sniffing?
[10:44:17] <uGoMobi> johnbender: in support.js we do some browser sniffing as well
[10:44:33] <uGoMobi> have to see if we look for the same browsers there
[10:45:15] <uGoMobi> johnbender: what I meant was https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/blob/workarounds/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L31 and https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/blob/workarounds/js/widgets/fixedToolbarWorkarounds.js#L13
[10:46:27] <uGoMobi> there we do the same thing twice
[10:47:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: in that case can't the extension call into the parent code?
[10:47:42] <johnbender> or maybe that's what you meant
[10:48:44] <arschmitz> johnbender: its not exactly the same one excludes broswers completely and ends the widget the other opts certain browsers into the workarounds
[10:48:59] <arschmitz> johnbender: so cant just call the parent function
[10:49:20] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yup, that's what I was thinking too
[10:49:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: right
[10:49:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: here's what I would suggest
[10:51:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: merge what you have now, write tests for both of the sniffing methods (refactor as needed to allow injection of fake ua strings), then attempt to merge what functionality you can
[10:51:41] <johnbender> arschmitz: I would set them up so they can be used as methods or as functions
[10:51:51] <johnbender> for testing purposes
[10:52:27] <johnbender> function( ua, platform) { var ua = ua || navigater.userAgent ... }
[10:53:05] <johnbender> equal( $.mobile.fixedtoolbar.prototype._workarounds( "foo", "bar" ), "baz" )
[10:53:30] <johnbender> and you might move the invocation  of the various workarounds up into the _create extension
[10:53:42] <johnbender> so that you just get a ua sniff result of some sort from that function
[10:54:06] <johnbender> or you can just stub them :)
[10:54:08] <johnbender> up to you
[10:54:15] <johnbender> should be fast and easy to test
[10:54:16] <arschmitz> ok
[10:54:20] <johnbender> after that
[10:54:36] <johnbender> it'll be safer to try and share
[10:54:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: are you comfortable with merging what he has there now?
[10:55:31] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes I am, you checked the code as well, right?
[10:55:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah looks good
[10:56:25] <uGoMobi> I agree preventing duplication is something that can be done after merging
[10:56:35] <toddmparker> catching up, hold on a sec...
[10:56:41] <uGoMobi> was more meant as possible improvement
[10:56:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: and a smart one
[10:56:53] <johnbender> also it forces testing which I like :)
[10:57:10] <uGoMobi> haha yeah I know you like that :)
[10:57:19] <arschmitz> johnbender: uGoMobi: i totally agree its better to combine i just wasent sure the best way to go about it
[10:58:23] <uGoMobi> maybe the solution is that we centralize browser sniffing like johnbender mentioned
[10:58:35] <toddmparker> johnbender: The plan for this is to probably package the extension as part of the library for 1.3 but down the road we can stop supporting it
[10:58:52] <toddmparker> sort of how we broke out custom select menus from custom select
[10:58:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i looked at support and i think that might be a good place for it
[10:59:03] <johnbender> toddmparker: sounds good
[10:59:06] <toddmparker> that way, people can choose to not add this hackery
[10:59:13] <toddmparker> in the download builder
[10:59:47] <johnbender> uGoMobi: arschmitz: lets just get it reconciled between the widget and the extension first
[10:59:47] <toddmparker> think anything more aggressive would make too many people mad. scottjehl__ might disagree, but that's where I'm at
[11:00:00] <johnbender> merged,  tested, reconciled, think about centralizing
[11:00:01] <toddmparker> once this is ready, I'd land it in master and ask people to help us test
[11:00:11] <toddmparker> think that
[11:00:15] <johnbender> agreed
[11:00:15] <toddmparker> is a good plan
[11:00:23] <arschmitz> sounds good to me
[11:00:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you think we can add the webkit transform3D fix to the workaround JS too?
[11:01:12] <uGoMobi> not completely sure if you can set that property with jQuery .css()
[11:01:24] <uGoMobi> that is... I never tried
[11:01:31] <arschmitz> its not related to the fixed toolbars so much as list view but potentially
[11:01:57] <uGoMobi> yeah that's true
[11:01:59] <toddmparker> yeah, seems like a different widget
[11:02:24] <toddmparker> i think we can land that after testing and ask devs to test it on custom lists
[11:02:30] <uGoMobi> but if you don't use fixed toolbars for Android 2.3 (leave out workaround code) you won't have this issue with listviews either
[11:03:00] <arschmitz> could do listview._workarounds lol
[11:03:38] <uGoMobi> haha
[11:04:18] <arschmitz> start throwing all workarounds into workarounds extensions of the widgets lol
[11:05:57] <toddmparker> oh, i see
[11:05:59] <toddmparker> sheesh
[11:06:20] <toddmparker> so this is a workaround only if fixed toolbars are in play
[11:06:26] <arschmitz> yes
[11:06:38] <arschmitz> so could go in fixed toolbars
[11:06:59] <uGoMobi> it is just that the webkit transform3D fix feels a bit like setTimeout
[11:07:16] <toddmparker> it is
[11:07:18] <Wilto> Woah, hey, hi.
[11:07:18] <arschmitz> just throw it in and hope for the best lol
[11:07:18] <uGoMobi> so it would be nice if it is only used when really needed
[11:07:56] <arschmitz> i can add a workaround for it with out much trouble
[11:08:39] <arschmitz> well i asuume as long as setting it with like .css() still works
[11:11:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: this is also something we can look into after your workaround JS is merged
[11:11:18] <Wilto> Don’t we add a class to .ui-page when the fixed header/footer is in play?
[11:11:23] <uGoMobi> didn't mean we have to check that out first
[11:11:31] <uGoMobi> Wilto: yes we do
[11:11:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:yeah
[11:11:35] <Wilto> Oh, yeah.
[11:11:41] <toddmparker> scope it to that then?
[11:11:51] <Wilto> I’m tuning in late, but just scope the thumbnail hack-style to that.
[11:12:01] <arschmitz> sounds good to me
[11:12:02] <toddmparker> this extension could tack on a class too if needed, if you wanted to scope it way in
[11:12:08] <Wilto> I wouldn’t wanna start blurring the line between our JS and CSS hackiness.
[11:12:56] <uGoMobi> I think what toddmparker is saying is best solution
[11:13:01] <uGoMobi> forget about .css()
[11:13:23] <uGoMobi> just like the ios-fixed class
[11:14:48] <uGoMobi> because the issue is only reported for android 2.3 I think it's good to only apply it for that browser
[11:17:45] <toddmparker> we could tack on a class to the page from that hackery extension
[11:18:01] <toddmparker> fixed-hacks or whatever and add that to the scope
[11:19:24] <arschmitz> sounds like a plan

[13:19:03] <gseguin> gnarf: I just saw your highlight in #jquery-meeting
[13:19:16] <gseguin> I don't think that it's actually needed anymore
[13:19:40] <gnarf> don't need to prime it?
[13:19:41] <gseguin> well, not for new releases at least
[13:20:01] <gnarf> if so, i could rip that out of the puppet script
[13:20:02] <gseguin> I added some code to handle semver tags
[13:20:21] <gseguin> but that doesn't work for -stable branches for instance
[13:20:37] <gnarf> branches aren't tags :)
[13:20:46] <gseguin> yep
[13:21:02] <gseguin> and the other thing is it works only for future tags
[13:21:25] <gseguin> so if for some reasons we were to deploy that on a fresh system
[13:21:48] <gseguin> that puppet script would still be needed
[13:22:01] <gseguin> I guess I could also check existing tags
[13:24:21] <gseguin> gnarf: https://github.com/gseguin/node-amd-builder/issues/7
[13:24:31] <gseguin> I'll make it work
[13:26:15] <gnarf> gseguin: thanks
[13:26:22] <gnarf> gseguin: be sure to cc me on the close of that one :)
[13:26:37] <gseguin> will do

[15:18:53] <agcolom> just some quick feedback on tables...
[15:20:34] <_|Nix|_> Woo-hoo! Under 300 issues ... niceness!
[15:27:30] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: I know! how great is that!
[15:28:10] <agcolom> Some people have been working really hard!!!!!
[15:33:43] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Indeed!
[15:35:17] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Have you changed time (winter time, clock went backwards one hour last saturday?)
[15:36:06] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yep.
[15:36:51] <agcolom> so the meeting will appear as being 1h earlier than usual for us tomorrow, so I think it'll be 6pm instead of 7pm for me... Is that correct?
[15:37:20] <_|Nix|_> Well, let's see: http://timeanddate.com/worldclock
[15:38:08] <agcolom> yep, that seems to confirm it... I only currently have 4h difference with Boston, instead of the usual 5h
[15:38:29] <_|Nix|_> Yep, so early it is.
[15:39:02] <agcolom> I think they change this coming saturday, so the diff is only for tomorrow....
[15:40:58] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I think that the meeting tomorrow will be at 7pm for you instead of the usual 8pm as the US have not yet moved to winter time..
[15:41:13] <agcolom> goodnight _|Nix|_ ! Speak tomorrow :-)
[15:43:10] <_|Nix|_> Good night!
