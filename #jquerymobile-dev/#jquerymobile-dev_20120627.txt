[00:49:09] <subdesign> hi
[00:50:00] <subdesign> have little problem with theming. I've made a theme, downloaded, installed but I see only the default themes on my site
[00:50:12] <subdesign> any idea why?
[00:52:14] <subdesign> ok nevermind..
[00:53:44] <agcolom> subdesign, which swatch letter did you use?
[00:54:14] <subdesign> i mixed up the order of css files..
[00:54:23] <agcolom> ok, so you're ok now?
[00:54:28] <subdesign> yes thx
[00:54:39] <agcolom> Cool :-)
[00:55:30] <subdesign> agcolom, how do you test you jqm site? dyndns or ?
[00:56:31] <agcolom> that's a question for johnbender
[00:57:04] <agcolom> and we also test on real devices....
[00:57:16] <subdesign> ah i see
[00:57:30] <subdesign> so you have android sdk and test in the emulator
[00:58:00] <agcolom> probably but also some Android devices...
[00:58:29] <agcolom> We must have around 50 devices altogehther
[00:58:59] <subdesign> i see
[01:01:55] <subdesign> im searching a good way to test sites developed on local env. where i can test quickly. so I dont want to copy every time all things to my phone , just reach the site trough wifi and test this way
[01:02:46] <subdesign> im stucked with sdk, stopped install after 3 hours ..
[01:03:50] <subdesign> and have problems reaching my local dev sites with real phone, .. my Opera renders pages so ugly i dont know why
[01:06:14] <agcolom> For testing, iOS simulator is pretty good... Android emulators may not render 100% as the real device I heard. Also with Android, each version may give you different results, so that's the most difficult one for testing. iOS, some features will be supported in iOS 5 but not iOS 4, so you need to test both.
[01:07:09] <agcolom> ideally you should deploy to a server and test on that.
[01:07:40] <subdesign> ah okay
[01:08:23] <subdesign> thanks
[01:08:26] <agcolom> you need to test also the different screen size factor and the UI interaction (make sure it supports touch events/mouse events)
[01:10:11] <agcolom> on the real device, you can also test how easy it is to touch elements on you UI without making mistakes or touching other elements that might be too close.
[01:10:41] <agcolom> ok, I'm off to take my son to school :-)
[01:10:46] <subdesign> yes, jqm helps lot in these problems
[01:11:05] <agcolom> Yes, indeed
[01:49:15] <MauriceG> Hi Anne: this too: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1-rc.1/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html
[01:49:51] <MauriceG> agcolom: ^^. putting it together paragraph
[01:52:39] <agcolom> MauriceG Ah yes! Well spotted! I'm waiting for johnbender to know where to make the change since he's got things ready....
[01:57:06] <MauriceG> a bit late unfortunately ...
[02:01:09] <uGoMobi> good morning
[02:02:00] <agcolom> Good morning Jasper,
[02:03:04] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: might be a good idea to have a checklist on basecamp with files that need to be updated when we release new version
[02:03:16] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[02:03:46] <MauriceG> good morning Jasper
[02:04:04] <uGoMobi> hi Maurice
[02:06:24] <MauriceG> Anne, are the template pages ok? I'm on iPad, can not look
[02:06:45] <agcolom> uGoMobi, yes that's what I had planned to do today!
[02:07:04] <agcolom> Maurice, yes the template pages have been done
[02:07:24] <agcolom> I'll write a doc and upload it there...
[02:08:46] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, cool!
[02:09:21] <MauriceG> bte that both pages seems to break the navigation in the docs cause of different
[02:09:34] <MauriceG> sources
[02:09:52] <MauriceG> *btw
[02:28:03] <MauriceG> if I navigate to a template, then back, then home, the browser navigates to home and then back to the pages listview.
[02:41:12] <agcolom> which template are you viewing? single or multiple?

[04:31:54] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4521 on jquery-mobile (chrisben; 1w, 5d ago): navigation broken in Opera12
[04:38:44] <subdesign> hi
[04:39:14] <subdesign> anyone using android emulator for dev?
[04:39:56] <uGoMobi> subdesign: I have android sdk installed yes
[04:40:29] <subdesign> my prob is i dont have design (css) on a local dev site
[04:40:37] <subdesign> only html
[04:40:40] <subdesign> any idea why?
[04:41:24] <uGoMobi> and the js?
[04:41:37] <subdesign> i guess not js too
[04:41:50] <subdesign> online sites are loading well
[04:42:14] <uGoMobi> do you point to js and css on jQuery CDN?
[04:42:19] <uGoMobi> or have local copies?
[04:42:36] <subdesign> local
[04:42:42] <subdesign> thats the point?
[04:42:56] <uGoMobi> nah, should be fine
[04:43:17] <uGoMobi> hmm, strange
[04:43:58] <uGoMobi> i don't use it that often because I have real Android device to test on, but don't remember issues with testing local JQM site
[04:44:28] <subdesign> ok how you test with your phone? connect trough wifi?
[04:44:36] <uGoMobi> yes
[04:45:09] <uGoMobi> but I test online sites
[04:45:22] <uGoMobi> I never linked the device to the sdk
[04:45:59] <subdesign> me neither, but cant connect phone to test localhost and trying ways..
[04:46:34] <subdesign> lol, plain localhost (phpinfo() ) has css
[04:47:15] <subdesign> thx uGoMobi
[04:47:34] <uGoMobi> and if you visit your jqm site on local host with browser it all works? just not on Android SDK?
[04:47:37] <subdesign> maybe my last change to use online sites as you
[04:47:52] <subdesign> of course
[04:48:01] <subdesign> with desktop browsers all fine
[04:48:09] <uGoMobi> weird
[04:48:36] <uGoMobi> sorry, but really don't know what could cause this
[04:49:08] <subdesign> http://d.pr/i/SjdG
[04:49:55] <uGoMobi> could it be phpinfo uses inline style?
[04:50:38] <subdesign> :) yes :(
[04:50:43] <subdesign> i forgot that to check
[04:51:36] <subdesign> uGoMobi, you dev jqm sites?
[04:51:46] <uGoMobi> yes
[04:52:11] <subdesign> do you suggest phonegap or its isn't a must?
[04:52:19] <uGoMobi> working on JQM Wordpress theme project
[04:53:09] <uGoMobi> completely depends on what kind site/web app you are building I think
[04:54:24] <subdesign> right
[04:54:33] <uGoMobi> but to be honest I don't know much about PhoneGap
[04:54:44] <subdesign> anyway, i changed my base_url to 10.0.2.2 so all my css/js working hehe
[04:54:51] <uGoMobi> so can't really tell when it is an advantage to use PhoneGap
[04:55:00] <subdesign> ok
[04:55:10] <uGoMobi> hehe glad you got it to work
[04:57:08] <uGoMobi> in general I would say... for a website no PhoneGap needed and for an app it might be a good idea
[04:57:18] <uGoMobi> but probably not saying anything new here :)
[04:58:11] <subdesign> :)
[04:59:45] <subdesign> is here a helpful community for jqm ? guess not so big as for jquery
[05:00:32] <uGoMobi> JQM is quite popular so the community is growing fast
[05:00:43] <uGoMobi> forum is pretty active https://forum.jquery.com/jquery-mobile
[05:01:01] <uGoMobi> and stackoverflow
[05:02:28] <subdesign> nice
[05:10:43] <agcolom> toddmparker_ can I push 2 necessary commits to 1.1-stable (2 more files need the correct URL)
[05:13:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom: toddmparker_ just commented on basecamp
[05:14:26] <agcolom> yes, just saw that and replied... Cool :-)
[05:14:34] <agcolom> Thanks Jasper :-)

[07:12:00] <miketaylr> uGoMobi: so what's the plan re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4521#issuecomment-6596423
[07:12:01] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4521 on jquery-mobile (chrisben; 1w, 5d ago): navigation broken in Opera12
[07:12:57] <uGoMobi> hi miketaylr
[07:13:04] <miketaylr> hey
[07:14:09] <uGoMobi> miketaylr: the plan is to make sure JQM 1.1.1 works on Opera 12 by that temporary fix and then start working transitions for Opera
[07:14:31] <miketaylr> uGoMobi: can you comment that in the thread?
[07:14:41] <miketaylr> right now it looks like "let's just block Opera"
[07:15:12] <uGoMobi> miketaylr: It says Exclude Opera from support.cssTransitions as long as we are not ready to support it.
[07:15:26] <miketaylr> ...
[07:15:50] <uGoMobi> I thought that explained it, but sure I can add a comment there that it is just a temporary quick fix
[07:15:55] <miketaylr> uGoMobi: was this discussed somewhere that I can read?
[07:15:58] <miketaylr> like, meeting logs?
[07:16:10] <uGoMobi> no
[07:16:28] <uGoMobi> well, we talked about it during last meeting
[07:16:30] <miketaylr> and this isn't really about transitions--it's about CSS animations
[07:16:37] <uGoMobi> but not this fix in particular
[07:16:41] <miketaylr> right i saw those logs, and i thought they said "to be discussed"
[07:16:44] <Wilto> “Transitions” between pages, yeah.
[07:16:59] <uGoMobi> hi Wilto
[07:17:03] <Wilto> Yo yo.
[07:17:04] <miketaylr> but somehow your css animations code is behind a css animations feature check
[07:17:09] <miketaylr> uhh transitions
[07:17:13] * miketaylr sucks at typing
[07:17:32] <Wilto> Yeah. A lot of things that “support” animation do so, uh, only technically.
[07:17:52] <Wilto> So we have to be a little cautious about gating there, since bugs come a-pouring in about crappy animations all the time if not.
[07:18:03] <miketaylr> afaict, the only thing blocked from animations is opera 12 (which just got them)
[07:18:14] <miketaylr> (unless i'm looking in the wrong place)
[07:18:24] <Wilto> Depends. Anything without 3D animations only gets fade transitions.
[07:18:36] <miketaylr> 3d animations?
[07:18:37] <Wilto> …Anything without 3D transforms. It’s early for me.
[07:18:40] <miketaylr> :D
[07:18:49] <miketaylr> right, i'm talking @keyframes
[07:19:26] <miketaylr> should be fun when everyone unprefixes
[07:19:29] <Wilto> There’s additional logic that goes into the animation stuff that we forego if keyframe animation isn’t supported.
[07:19:40] <Wilto> Man, no joke.
[07:19:48] <miketaylr> gonna be browser sniffing soup
[07:19:55] <Wilto> I like to think that we used prefixes in a responsible way, but blah blah internet opinions.
[07:19:59] <Wilto> ASK ME ABOUT SEMICOLONS SOMETIME
[07:20:01] <miketaylr> so when is the next meeting?
[07:20:02] <Wilto> miketaylr: NEVER
[07:20:20] <miketaylr> i'd like to talk about actual plans other than "we're not ready to support it"
[07:20:51] <miketaylr> i can also find a rough timeline for css animations support in opera mobile
[07:21:07] <miketaylr> (i think there's a release coming up soon, i don't remember when)
[07:21:11] <Wilto> I mean, I know the plan for this: we just want to be able to officially support it once we’ve had time to test thoroughly, if it doesn’t suck.
[07:21:24] <Wilto> —which is not to say that I expect it to suck. We’re all a little jaded from dealing with animations.
[07:21:28] <Wilto> coughandroidcough
[07:21:37] <miketaylr> can i crash your thursday 2pm meeting for 5 mins?
[07:21:44] * miketaylr just saw /topic
[07:21:51] <Wilto> Cheah cheah, man.
[07:22:01] <miketaylr> coolllllllll. thx Wilto uGoMobi
[07:22:24] <Wilto> …you don’t have a working Opera Mobile with keyframe animation support, dooo you?
[07:22:28] <miketaylr> oh that's like, tomorrow
[07:22:44] <miketaylr> Wilto: i need to check if that's integrated yet
[07:22:46] <Wilto> Also, Todd and Scott are out of town. Not gonna be the most formal meetings, odds are.
[07:22:51] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #235: NOW UNSTABLE in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/235/
[07:22:58] <miketaylr> oh when do they get back?
[07:23:09] <Wilto> miketaylr: I’ll make a deal with you: as soon as you got something testable, we will test that B out.
[07:23:23] <Wilto> It’s just a matter of staying ahead of the general populace on this stuff, y’know?
[07:23:32] <miketaylr> yaya
[07:24:06] <miketaylr> lemme see about getting Filament Group NDA'd or something about unreleased products
[07:24:08] <Wilto> Otherwise we don’t just get bugs, we get lots of “I FOUND A QUICK FIX FOR OPERA ANIMATIONS” Stack Overflow threads, which just happen to break animations in twelve other browsers.
[07:24:12] <Wilto> Oh hell yes.
[07:24:36] <miketaylr> (ftr, my fix only affected Opera 12)
[07:25:11] <Wilto> You know we got nothin’ but love for Bropera. A little sneak-preview access would be a huge help.
[07:25:37] <miketaylr> Wilto: ok, so i'll probably skip your meeting tomorrow then and wait for when you todd and scott can all be around
[07:25:58] <Wilto> Yeah, no worries. We can set up an impromptu call at some point, too, if everyone’s kicking around.
[07:31:12] <Wilto> Oh, also, miketaylr: you did it wrong, dude.
[07:31:25] <Wilto> The proper protocol for calling someone out in #jquerymobile-dev is as follows:
[07:31:33] <Wilto> DAMMIT, MIKETAYLR
[07:36:39] <miketaylr> duly noted, swearing in all caps
[07:37:47] <Wilto> Correct.
[08:25:59] <agcolom> Wilto: Hi! You're not going the jQuery Conference?
[08:34:50] <agcolom> uGoMobi: We have a problem with the popup map
[08:52:52] <agcolom> POPUP BUG!!!!!!
[08:57:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/0QPZmg
[08:57:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] removed close button on map  - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[09:01:40] <toddmparker_> agcolom: the map and video examples completely block page rendering if you're on a bad web connection.
[09:01:52] <toddmparker_> 3rd party stuff is always ugly
[09:02:13] <agcolom> yes, there's something wrong with the rendering in the docs
[09:02:14] <toddmparker_> wilto - suggestions for sandboxing these to avoid hanging while waiting for google to load
[09:02:24] <toddmparker_> miketaylr: hey
[09:02:34] <miketaylr> sup toddmparker_
[09:02:38] <agcolom> Does it look ok for you with this one: http://jsbin.com/okehir/85/
[09:02:58] <toddmparker_> just following up on the opera 12 bizness
[09:03:00] <miketaylr> toddmparker_: i just told Wilto i'm working on getting you guys some opera mobile next builds w/ animations so you guys can test
[09:03:13] <toddmparker_> hey - are you going to be at jQ con this week?
[09:03:19] <toddmparker_> cool
[09:03:19] <miketaylr> naw, not this one
[09:03:50] <toddmparker_> kk
[09:04:12] <toddmparker_> so is the plan for opera to look at -webkit keyframes anyhow in 12?
[09:04:30] <miketaylr> hmm, i don't think so
[09:04:39] <miketaylr> but i can check
[09:04:40] <toddmparker_> reason I ask is all these vendor prefixed keyframe animations are bloat-tastic
[09:04:42] <toddmparker_> no? ok
[09:04:53] <miketaylr> we just unprefixed internally
[09:05:09] <miketaylr> i want to make sure mobile takes in that fix before releasing
[09:05:10] <toddmparker_> so you'll probably nove to un-prefixed in 13?
[09:05:25] <miketaylr> or whatever it is, 12.1, 12.5
[09:05:31] <toddmparker_> ok so soon-ish
[09:05:34] <miketaylr> right now opera mobile 12 doesn't have any support
[09:05:45] <toddmparker_> for KF?
[09:05:50] <miketaylr> yeah
[09:05:52] <miketaylr> just opera desktop
[09:06:04] <miketaylr> but the next mobile release should update presto to the point to have support
[09:06:19] <miketaylr> i'm emailing someone on the mobile team to find out--i'll let you guys know
[09:06:49] <toddmparker_> ah, right. too many operas :)
[09:06:54] <miketaylr> hehe
[09:07:01] <toddmparker_> ok, we just want to be in sync with you guys
[09:07:21] <toddmparker_> we just didn't want to ship 1.1.1 with opera erroring out
[09:07:28] <miketaylr> yeah, understood
[09:07:38] <toddmparker_> we plan on doing a 1.1.2 pretty soon after so we can fix this

[09:07:46] <toddmparker_> and 1.2 alpha will hit next week
[09:07:56] <toddmparker_> so there will be a lot of upgrading happing soon
[09:07:59] <miketaylr> dope
[09:08:16] <miketaylr> i'll ping you guys when i find out
[09:08:24] <toddmparker_> is you opinion that using -o won't be needed
[09:08:45] <miketaylr> that's what i hope, at least
[09:08:51] <toddmparker_> that you'll move to unprefixed fast enough that if we added un-prefixed rules, that might do the dip for you?
[09:09:28] <miketaylr> yeah
[09:09:32] <toddmparker_> cool
[09:09:38] <miketaylr> but i'll confirm that w/ the mobile guys
[09:09:48] <miketaylr> that css w/ all the prefixes is insane
[09:09:49] <toddmparker_> so just keep that issue updated with details and we'll stay on this
[09:09:56] <toddmparker_> yup
[09:10:00] <miketaylr> okey doke
[09:10:03] <toddmparker_> massively bloated
[09:10:08] <toddmparker_> pissa
[09:10:50] <miketaylr> lol
[09:13:05] <agcolom> toddmparker_ Does it look ok for you with this one: http://jsbin.com/okehir/85/
[09:13:38] <gseguin> good morning folks!
[09:14:58] <agcolom> Good morning !
[09:16:09] <gseguin> hey agcolom, what can I do for you?
[09:16:19] <agcolom> We forgot some necessary additions in the docs (demo code examples needed to show 1.1.1-rc.1) so I'm pushed 2 commits in 1.1-stable
[09:16:39] <uGoMobi> I am back
[09:16:41] <agcolom> I think uGoMobi pushed one as well??
[09:16:48] <agcolom> Hi Jasper...
[09:16:57] <gseguin> paging johnbender
[09:17:09] <uGoMobi> well the idea was one but something went wrong with my git so it were 3 ;)
[09:17:28] <uGoMobi> but yes, i pushed to 1.1-stable
[09:17:32] <agcolom> we saw you made one too, and toddmparker_ gave the go ahead signal for all this :-)
[09:17:37] <uGoMobi> you in SF now toddmparker_ ?
[09:18:21] <agcolom> uGoMobi, the map doesn't look good in FF. It's blurry and the top left control is missing (z-index issue) I think
[09:18:32] <uGoMobi> hmm
[09:18:42] <agcolom> But all looks ok when I look at my original code: http://jsbin.com/okehir/85/
[09:18:50] <agcolom> I'm looking at he diffs...
[09:19:14] <agcolom> btw, I've moved the map in hte css to being the last thing there
[09:19:28] <agcolom> Initially it was not showing at all in Safari
[09:19:28] <uGoMobi> i had to remove some css from #mapCanvas
[09:20:07] <agcolom> otherwise, I was thinking of keeping the css in the html file just for the mapCanvas
[09:20:20] <uGoMobi> because there were conflicts with JQM docs css and popup css
[09:20:31] <agcolom> because we tell people this is where their custom css should go...
[09:20:40] <agcolom> exactly
[09:20:46] <uGoMobi> you mean in the head?
[09:21:07] <gseguin> toddmparker_: do we have a green light to re-tag RC1 ?
[09:21:19] <gseguin> who's going to do the deploy?
[09:21:23] <agcolom> yes in the head, last item in the head
[09:22:28] <agcolom> also, I removed the close button. I was encountering an error: If you opened a popup with a close button, the next popup opened without a close button could not be closed!
[09:22:55] <agcolom> (only removed it from the map) just in case Todd wants to demo
[09:23:46] <toddmparker_>  i'm on a plane with dodgy wifi
[09:23:59] <agcolom> in the air??
[09:24:36] <gseguin> you're so living in the future toddmparker_
[09:24:47] <toddmparker_> agcolom: what did you change on that bin?
[09:24:54] <agcolom> nothing
[09:25:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: why you want the style rules in the head ? I am not sure I follow
[09:25:10] <agcolom> that's the original code
[09:25:22] <toddmparker_> i did notice that there were scripts in the head on the popup page...those won't be loaded via ajax
[09:25:37] <toddmparker_> nothing in the head will be laoded via ajax
[09:25:51] <toddmparker_> i am gseguin
[09:26:00] <toddmparker_> and in the future, the web is slowwww
[09:26:00] <uGoMobi> the scripts are in the docs js file
[09:26:10] <toddmparker_> virgin is the only airline that has it now
[09:26:13] <toddmparker_> it's great
[09:26:15] <toddmparker_> outlets too
[09:26:29] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: yeah?
[09:26:29] <uGoMobi> and there is an onload at the body element
[09:26:45] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #237: STILL UNSTABLE in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/237/
[09:27:00] <toddmparker_> did johnbender do a new build?
[09:27:09] <agcolom> the scripts are in the js so not in the head. The maps can be tricky. But if you put the css for the map last in the head, you're garanteed the map css will be taken into account and override other stuff that could have affected your map....
[09:27:49] <agcolom> There are issues with the google map img css
[09:27:51] <uGoMobi> but the docs css is loaded after the framework css... same effect
[09:28:23] <agcolom> But currently the streetmap little map is not showing in hte docs
[09:28:35] <agcolom> little man ^
[09:28:50] <agcolom> (street map little man control)
[09:29:11] <agcolom> I don't think johnbender has done a new build yet
[09:29:26] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah i see what you mean
[09:30:04] <agcolom> can we try (or can you try locally whether this affects anything?_)
[09:30:15] <gseguin> actually Southwest has it too
[09:32:04] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I don't think so
[09:32:16] <gseguin> I think he's mid-air as well
[09:32:37] <toddmparker_> yeah gseguin? good to know.
[09:33:17] <gseguin> I can re-tag but I'd rather wait for Bender for the deploy
[09:34:00] <toddmparker_> sure, no rush. just curious
[09:35:42] <agcolom> uGoMobi, if you add this to the map canvas div css: -webkit-transform: translate3d(0,0,0);
[09:35:54] <agcolom> should fix I think
[09:36:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good idea
[09:36:38] <uGoMobi> going to try
[09:38:26] <agcolom> Wifi on a plane hey! I'm totally impressed! Someone told me in Sweden there is Wifi on buses! Can't wait for all this to come to London!
[09:41:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: none of these fix it
[09:42:09] <agcolom> gseguin, I guess you may have seen my note on basecamp... I did write a checklist on Google docs for changes that are required when we release a new version... then realised toddmparker_ had one on github, so updated the github one...
[09:42:16] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Shame!
[09:42:58] <agcolom> So there's something in docs css that is causing a conflict :-(
[09:43:11] <toddmparker_> boo
[09:43:24] <agcolom> let's try to add the docs css to my jsbin...
[09:43:41] <toddmparker_> agcolom: http://jquerymobile.com/donate-devices/
[09:43:46] <toddmparker_> just pushed this live
[09:43:55] <toddmparker_> guess we need to copy this over the new site
[09:45:31] <uGoMobi> acolom: the "street view little man" functionality is there but it isn't rendered properly
[09:46:19] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/okehir/87/
[09:46:23] <uGoMobi> and the close button of streetview isn't diplayed properly
[09:46:52] <uGoMobi> agcolom: on that one i don't see Mr streetview either
[09:47:35] <agcolom> yes, I'll play with this one this evening... just a zindex issue I think
[09:48:03] <agcolom> I've had the same issue in github and I did fix it, just can't remember how... it think it was z-index
[09:48:11] <agcolom> but to something specific
[09:48:18] <uGoMobi> tried z-index already... ni dice
[09:48:20] <uGoMobi> no*
[09:48:23] <agcolom> toddmparker_ Nice !
[09:49:04] <agcolom> but the strange thing that I don't understand is the map looks blurry in the docs demo
[09:49:06] <agcolom> in FF
[09:49:28] <agcolom> the jsbin with the docs css at least looks sharp
[09:53:04] <Wilto> Hey toddmparker_. Those examples could probably do with a little async action.
[09:53:29] <Wilto> I haven’t checked in in a while; what’s the status of fetchlinks?
[09:54:53] <toddmparker_> on hold
[09:55:25] <toddmparker_> but i agree that we should re-look at fetchlinks (ajax include) for 1.3
[10:00:02] <Wilto> Fo’ sho’.
[10:01:27] <Wilto> We could use that to load the popup stuff so as not to block the page. For now, though, we could either hand-code a little something to inject them or slap ’em in an iframe.
[10:05:58] <toddmparker_> iframe it is i think
[10:11:42] <agcolom> the video is in an iframe
[10:12:27] <uGoMobi> yeah, looks like the map needs an iframe...
[10:12:29] <uGoMobi> we only execute the function which constructs the Map object once the <body> element of the HTML page receives an onload event
[10:12:50] <uGoMobi> thats ^^^ from Google Maps api docs
[10:13:04] <agcolom> Ah, I remeber
[10:13:34] <agcolom> for the map, the link to that page need data-rel="external"
[10:14:29] <agcolom> but for the docs that's not practical
[10:14:46] <agcolom> so I agree with the iframe solution as well
[10:16:42] <agcolom> Sorry I'm a bit on and off... I am cooking!
[10:18:45] <agcolom> gseguin: I thought johnbender was in California??
[10:20:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Wilto toddmparker_ : got the map popup example in an iframe.... its all working, but have to tweak the css a little
[10:20:21] <agcolom> toddmparker: A colleague has lent me his Android 2.2 phone (Samsung... not sure what the model is)
[10:20:33] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Excellent news! Thanks!
[10:22:33] <toddmparker_> sounds good uGoMobi
[10:22:43] <toddmparker_> great agcolom
[10:23:15] <agcolom> So you can send testing requests on 2.2 my way.
[10:23:35] <agcolom> toddmparker: That page looks really nice!
[10:25:08] <agcolom> toddmparker_ ^ + how about we update your device spreadsheet with our own devices (for internal purposes) so that we know who can test what?
[10:26:18] <agcolom> toddmparker_ My colleague was also given Windows Phones by Microdoft... I've set my eyes on one of them.... May be temporary, but still could be useful...
[10:27:05] <agcolom> (he was given 2 I think to donate to students... but the students have gone now, so we're hoping to keep them for development)
[10:34:51] <toddmparker_> sounds good agcolom
[10:35:03] <toddmparker_> wp is good to test on. different beast
[10:35:11] <gseguin> agcolom: he is but he's in SoCal (L.A.)
[10:36:00] <agcolom> ah! I didn;t realise CA was so big!
[10:37:34] <gseguin> According to wikipedia: Length: 1,240 km
[10:38:02] <agcolom> yep! I was way off!
[10:42:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/fLWIRg
[10:42:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Adjusted popup base style for iframe. - Jasper de Groot
[10:42:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Moved popup map example to an iframe. - Jasper de Groot
[10:44:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: can you look at the second paragraph of the popup page?
[10:44:44] <uGoMobi> it now says "or a map to make a lightbox"
[10:45:05] <agcolom> yes
[10:45:06] <uGoMobi> thats was photo to make a lightbox
[10:45:20] <uGoMobi> but todd asked me to replace the example
[10:45:26] <agcolom> ok
[10:45:43] <uGoMobi> maybe better to do photo example to demonstrate lightbox
[10:46:10] <uGoMobi> so map will be extra sample there
[10:46:45] <agcolom> yes, I'd go with photo as lightbox
[10:46:51] <uGoMobi> yeah
[10:47:11] <uGoMobi> then the map should go somewhere else
[10:47:15] <uGoMobi> is already at the bottom
[10:47:30] <uGoMobi> but we wanted it at the top as well because it is nice
[10:47:39] <agcolom> yes, the map and videos at the bottom with the more advanced examples
[10:47:48] <agcolom> ah, I get it...
[10:48:03] <uGoMobi> an extra photo sample so we have one landscape and one portrait would be nice too
[10:48:09] <uGoMobi> ok :)
[10:48:18] <agcolom> can we put the margin back in for the map (I liked them :-) )
[10:48:40] <agcolom> that's why there a thin border
[10:49:01] <uGoMobi> you mean the thin border I just removed ;)
[10:49:07] <uGoMobi> haha sure no problem
[10:49:16] <uGoMobi> can put padding and the thin border back
[10:49:35] <uGoMobi> what about the close button? yes or no on the map?
[10:49:40] <agcolom> Oh sorry :-( I find it looks a bit more posh :-)
[10:50:23] <uGoMobi> i like the padding on the video example
[10:50:46] <agcolom> I haven't seen what close button looks like with the padding
[10:50:53] <uGoMobi> the video example I can't close right now :(
[10:50:56] <agcolom> would be interesting to see
[10:52:51] <toddmparker_> looking good!
[10:53:10] <toddmparker_> johnbender: what infra stuff should i highlight in my keynote?
[10:53:39] <toddmparker_> do you have 3-5 quick hits of stuff we want to highlight
[10:53:54] <toddmparker_> grunt, qunit?
[10:54:16] <gseguin> johnbender is MIA
[10:58:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/g6R8nA
[10:58:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Style tweak for the popup map example. - Jasper de Groot
[10:58:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: there you go
[11:00:01] <agcolom> just a sec...
[11:03:15] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #238: STILL UNSTABLE in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/238/
[11:04:40] <agcolom> it's still a bit blurry in FF... not sure why!
[11:05:43] <uGoMobi> dont see any difference between chrome and FF here
[11:06:01] <agcolom> I'm on FF 13 Mac OS
[11:06:41] <uGoMobi> I'm on FF12/Win now
[11:07:03] <uGoMobi> going to switch back to Linux and will check again
[11:07:44] <uGoMobi> but I dont have FF beta there either
[11:07:54] <agcolom> ok. It looks really sharp and beautiful on Safari!
[11:08:11] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:08:38] <toddmparker_> DAMMIT BENDER
[11:08:38] <toddmparker_> :)
[11:08:40] <uGoMobi> did you check Google map example on other non JQM websites?
[11:08:53] <toddmparker_> gseguin: what do you think the quick hits are?
[11:08:56] <agcolom> btw the power surge I got last week was my power supply dying! It is now dead
[11:09:10] <agcolom> my jsbin looks sharp in the same browser,
[11:09:14] <uGoMobi> ay RIP power supply
[11:09:51] <agcolom> So I now have to share my son's one with him
[11:10:07] <toddmparker_> bummer. those are $
[11:10:29] <toddmparker_> anne - i can't seem to access the stage.api and jqm sites on the plane
[11:10:43] <agcolom> Yes, luckily I've not spent all my project money yet, so it will be bought on my project.... Thank you very much...
[11:10:53] <toddmparker_> could you email me screenshots of a sample api page and the new web template?
[11:11:00] <agcolom> yep
[11:11:05] <toddmparker_> awesome
[11:11:22] <agcolom> (that's uni project if anyone was wondering ;-) )
[11:11:42] <agcolom> all has to be spent by next month, so got lucky!
[11:11:59] <agcolom> toddmparker: How many screen shots roughtly?
[11:12:06] <agcolom> roughly ^
[11:12:45] <uGoMobi> ok popup samples are good now, right?
[11:13:23] <uGoMobi> if you could look into good photo examples agcolom that would be great
[11:13:33] <uGoMobi> I really have to catch up with my own work :(
[11:13:41] <agcolom> yes, sure, will do.
[11:13:50] <uGoMobi> thanks!
[11:14:11] <agcolom> Have to swith off (dinner time). Will add that after dinner...
[11:14:29] <agcolom> toddmparker: should I email these to you?
[11:14:35] <agcolom> (screenshots)
[11:15:24] <uGoMobi> later all

[11:35:53] <agcolom> later Jasper!
[11:42:56] <agcolom> proposed vertical picture: http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/3300437441/in/photostream/
[11:45:00] <agcolom> proposed horizontal picture
[11:45:01] <agcolom> http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/3830932735/lightbox/
[11:45:51] <agcolom> or this one: http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/3902896330/lightbox/
[11:46:57] <agcolom> and another vertical one: http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/3892315425/lightbox/
[11:47:23] <gseguin> oh man it's goodies galore at google I/O
[11:48:29] <agcolom> or this one...http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/4052061478/lightbox/
[11:48:38] <agcolom> gseguin ??
[11:48:45] <agcolom> you're at google?
[11:52:45] <agcolom> watching online ?
[12:01:10] <agcolom> toddmparker_: I'll be at home tomorrow, so don't hesitate to give me a shout if you need last minute things for tomorrow.
[12:01:31] <agcolom> you can imessage me at coloma@wmin.ac.uk also
[12:07:28] <agcolom> toddmparker_ That's because it looks like something's been upgraded (possibly wordpress) and all is gone.... I get an error on grunt deploy.... will contact Richard
[12:21:06] <Wilto> Works for me, uGoMobi. Nicely done.
[12:22:17] <agcolom> Wilto, do you have a mac?
[12:22:25] <Wilto> agcolom: But of course.
[12:22:36] <agcolom> ah, do you have FF13?
[12:22:52] <Wilto> I could in a moment.
[12:22:58] <agcolom> (In FF 13, the map in the popup on the docs looks blurry!)
[12:23:02] <agcolom> (for me)
[12:23:34] <Wilto> Oh, I’m in 14 now, it seems.
[12:23:34] <agcolom> but if I look at http://jsbin.com/okehir/85 it looks fine!
[12:23:47] <Wilto> Is this up on /test?
[12:23:52] <agcolom> yes
[12:24:02] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[12:24:20] <agcolom> the map popup is at the bottom of the page
[12:24:46] <Wilto> Hm, looks okay from here…
[12:25:29] <agcolom> it looks sharp as on http://jsbin.com/okehir/85
[12:25:29] <Wilto> agcolom: http://wil.to/_/maps.png
[12:25:47] <Wilto> Left is /test, right is http://jsbin.com/okehir/85
[12:26:04] <agcolom> weird! It's blurry for me (a bit)
[12:26:13] <agcolom> never mind.
[12:26:17] <Wilto> Might be some weird FF13 thing?
[12:26:19] <Wilto> Oh, zoom?
[12:26:42] <agcolom> you think I'm in zoom mode?
[12:27:12] <agcolom> you're a genius!
[12:27:23] <agcolom> Wilto ^
[12:27:49] <Wilto> Hah, that trips me up all the time too.
[12:29:39] <agcolom> I can't believe this!!!!! I never would have thought of this! So would have remained a mystery until I would have restarted the browser! Well, I'll remember that! I change the zoom level by mistake sometimes... with the trackpad!
[12:31:48] <Wilto> Ever since the advent of em-based media queries, I got zoom levels all over the damn place.
[12:33:20] <agcolom> so you're not going to SF?
[12:48:54] <agcolom> toddmparker_ I have found some pictures for the popup demos under cc. We need to attribute the picture to the author. How and where do we do that?
[12:54:57] <gseguin> agcolom: watching online
[12:55:04] <gseguin> I wish I were there
[12:55:20] <gseguin> but I missed the ticket snagging
[12:58:23] <agcolom> shame :-( is that in SF as well?
[13:00:07] <agcolom> jzaefferer: has there been some changes to the doc api site/server?
[13:00:40] <jzaefferer> agcolom: could be, not sure
[13:01:30] <agcolom> Richard replied...  apparently he knows what's wrong... will fix in 20mins... sorry I was panicking (need to do some screen shots and all was gone... )
[13:02:03] <jzaefferer> ah, okay
[13:03:48] <agcolom> gseguin: could you help me choose 2 pictures (one vertical, one horizontal) for the popup demos? Please?
[13:04:30] <gseguin> agcolom: it's in SF
[13:05:32] <agcolom> shame, would have been easy for you to go!  Is that where you live?
[13:05:46] <gseguin> yeah close by
[13:05:55] <agcolom> sounds nice!
[13:05:55] <gseguin> it was very hard to get a ticket
[13:06:02] <gseguin> and they weren't cheap
[13:06:12] <agcolom> really? How much ?
[13:06:50] <gseguin> I think they were $1,200 but I'm not sure
[13:06:51] <agcolom> ok, proposed vertical picture 1: http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/3300437441/in/photostream/
[13:07:05] <agcolom> that is crazy money! For one day?
[13:07:18] <gseguin> neh it's 3 days
[13:07:59] <agcolom> ah...
[13:08:03] <gseguin> agcolom: you want to filter your search to Creative Commons-licensed images
[13:08:07] <agcolom> still expensive@
[13:08:16] <agcolom> I have
[13:08:47] <agcolom> proposed vertical picture 2: http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/3892315425/lightbox/
[13:09:12] <gseguin> I like that one better
[13:10:05] <agcolom> this one...http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/4052061478/lightbox/
[13:10:41] <agcolom> sorry Taht's a horizontal
[13:10:54] <agcolom> so vertical picture 2 for vertical then
[13:11:17] <Wilto> Nope, I’m stayin’ in Boston for a good long while.
[13:11:44] <Wilto> Too much traveling lately, and being outside my city for too long saps me of my strength. Also I got websites to build.
[13:12:03] <agcolom> ah, yes, works need to be done!
[13:12:16] <agcolom> for horizontal we have:
[13:12:28] <gseguin> Wilto: are we never going to meet?
[13:12:46] <agcolom> http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/3830932735/lightbox/
[13:12:46] <agcolom> or this one: http://www.flickr.com/photos/earlycj5/3902896330/lightbox/
[13:12:55] <Wilto> gseguin: I’m actually the “Tyler Durden” to Todd’s “Narrator.”
[13:12:58] <Wilto> I’m not even real.
[13:13:14] <gseguin> That's what I thought
[13:13:53] <gseguin> Is Todd going to arrive with bruises all over his face?
[13:14:10] <Wilto> Y
[13:15:10] <gseguin> from fighting, did I miss something?
[13:15:27] <gseguin> isn't Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt in Fight Club?
[13:15:49] <Wilto> Aww yes.
[13:15:54] <Wilto> That was “Y” as in “yes.”
[13:16:11] <gseguin> Oh I thought it was Y as in why
[13:16:40] <gseguin> agcolom: how about this one: http://www.flickr.com/photos/chanc/1490625922/
[13:18:11] <agcolom> nice but we want to show image going right to the edge of the popup. This one has top and bottom black strips (sorry it's late, I'm forgetting words)
[13:18:43] <agcolom> Do you have a good one of that bridge without strips?
[13:18:56] <agcolom> (is that the correct way to say this?)
[13:23:44] <gseguin> I think so
[13:23:45] <agcolom> toddmparker_ have you landed yet?
[13:23:57] <gseguin> let me continue my search then
[13:24:09] <agcolom> ok, thank you :-)
[13:24:38] <gseguin> agcolom: how about: http://www.flickr.com/photos/pepino1976/7410942580/
[13:25:30] <gseguin> johnbend1r: hey man!
[13:25:46] <gseguin> you in SF?
[13:25:59] <Wilto> Whatup, JB.
[13:27:08] <johnbend1r> gseguin: I am indeed
[13:27:10] <johnbend1r> Wilto: hey
[13:27:33] <johnbend1r> gseguin: did you guys get the patches and tag sorted out
[13:27:38] <gseguin> johnbend1r: we need to either re-tag or tag RC2
[13:27:46] <johnbend1r> gseguin: I'm not sure what that looks like
[13:27:47] <gseguin> it's all in 1.1-stable
[13:27:51] <johnbend1r> can you force the tag change?
[13:28:01] <gseguin> I bet you can
[13:28:04] <johnbend1r> well
[13:28:05] <johnbend1r> I mean
[13:28:12] <johnbend1r> I know we can force it but without reprecusions :(
[13:28:32] <johnbend1r> rc.1.1 ?
[13:28:33] <johnbend1r> lol
[13:28:38] <gseguin> hey we haven't communicated at all on that tag
[13:28:43] <johnbend1r> true
[13:28:44] <gseguin> so it would be fair
[13:28:46] <johnbend1r> but it's still out there
[13:28:46] <gseguin> but
[13:29:00] <gseguin> I understand your concern
[13:29:11] <gseguin> so doing RC2 would be the alternative
[13:29:27] <gseguin> but in that case we need to change the version strings
[13:29:34] <agcolom> if it's rc2, then we need to change the docs
[13:29:51] <johnbend1r> "Improved HTML5/CSS3/Canvas animation performance."
[13:29:59] <johnbend1r> that's from the android 4.1 website
[13:30:14] <johnbend1r> gseguin: lets just force it
[13:30:31] <johnbend1r> the pragmatist John Bender got off the plane in SFO
[13:30:44] <gseguin> Wilto: you're going to love the new Android!
[13:30:49] <Wilto> oh no
[13:30:51] <Wilto> oh god why
[13:31:07] <Wilto> Oh, actually, I got high hopes for Jellybean.
[13:31:19] <agcolom> I've prepared a checklist for future releases! So we don't forget anything...
[13:31:30] <johnbend1r> I was just looking to see if I could get the update manually
[13:31:34] <johnbend1r> I'm stuck at 4.0.1
[13:31:41] <johnbend1r> which is like the worst possible place to be stuck
[13:31:53] * johnbend1r thinks it's because he's on T-Mobile with an att phone
[13:33:04] <johnbend1r> toddmparker_: are you going to the speakers dinner tonight?
[13:35:16] <agcolom> johnbend1r, gseguin, Wilto: feel free to add stuff there: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Release-Instructions-Checklist
[13:39:27] <agcolom> toddmparker_ are you ok to crop screen shots yourself?
[13:40:55] <johnbend1r> Wilto: are you in SF too?
[13:41:03] * johnbend1r is under the impression that Wilto is indeed in SF
[13:41:39] <gseguin> nope he's building websites back East
[13:42:45] <johnbend1r> well at least he won't have to sit through my talk :D
[13:44:06] <johnbend1r> gseguin: do you know which commit I'm supposed to tag?
[13:44:37] * gseguin checks
[13:45:40] <gseguin> uh oh, github...
[13:46:44] <gseguin> johnbend1r: the latest: ebd173c31e0ac487e41215422db213eb9497b09d
[13:47:37] <johnbend1r> kk
[13:47:44] <johnbend1r> gseguin: yah it's not working for me either
[13:47:54] <gseguin> it's back up
[13:47:57] <johnbend1r> I was just about to check to see who broke the build
[13:48:05] <johnbend1r> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/571c08e3b003ac1bbf85bf34b49b104b24dc69b5
[13:48:05] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Jasper de Groot (20h, 48m ago): Fixes #4347 - New styling for read-only lists.
[13:48:12] <johnbend1r> uGoMobi: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/231/
[13:48:21] <johnbend1r> uGoMobi: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/
[13:48:39] <johnbend1r> that commit appears to have broken the listview tests
[13:49:24] <johnbend1r> commented on the commit
[13:49:34] <johnbend1r> gseguin: ok I'm going to try tagging and pushing the tag
[13:49:37] * johnbend1r crosses his fingers
[13:51:24] <gseguin> let me know when you've done so I need to refresh the builder
[13:51:41] <johnbend1r> gseguin: well it's been pushed but I'm trying to check github to make sure it's in the rigt place
[13:51:44] <johnbend1r> ....
[13:51:45] <johnbend1r> ....
[13:52:07] <johnbend1r> gseguin: bingo
[13:52:13] <gseguin> cool
[13:52:55] <johnbend1r> gseguin: let me know if you need anything else
[13:53:31] <agcolom> gseguin it's a nice picture, but I'm after a really sharp looking one. with strong colors...
[13:53:41] <gseguin> it's all good johnbend1r
[13:53:48] <gseguin> the builder looks good now
[13:55:23] <agcolom> gseguin: your 1st one was better in that sense... I
[13:56:09] <gseguin> agcolom: I'll try to look for one later
[13:56:23] <agcolom> ok. thanks
[13:57:17] <uGoMobi> hi all
[13:57:25] <agcolom> Hi Jasper!
[13:57:44] <agcolom> I thought you were working on your stuff tonight!
[13:58:12] <uGoMobi> yes, I am
[13:58:34] <agcolom> Good. You need to keep the business going ;-)
[13:58:54] <uGoMobi> :D
[14:00:21] <uGoMobi> johnbend1r:saw your comment
[14:00:37] <uGoMobi> think I need to update a test then
[14:01:05] <johnbend1r> uGoMobi: yah seems like it
[14:01:13] <johnbend1r> we also need to add you guys to the failure emails
[14:01:42] <agcolom> johnbend1r: how long does it take for the rc1 site to get updated with the new build?
[14:03:42] <uGoMobi> johnbend1r: I check jenkins site on regular base
[14:04:19] <uGoMobi> but since there were many test failures on master lately I think I missed this one
[14:06:30] <uGoMobi> I know see that all latest test failures were about that listview :(
[14:07:41] <uGoMobi> I remember seeing many failures related to absolute path
[14:08:04] <johnbend1r> uGoMobi: kk
[14:08:05] <uGoMobi> anyway... will check the listview tests
[14:08:15] <johnbend1r> uGoMobi: let me know if you need any hlp
[14:08:18] * uGoMobi should look better
[14:08:21] <johnbend1r> I'm going to work on my preso
[14:08:39] <uGoMobi> johnbend1r: ok thanks, and good luck with your presentation !!
[14:20:10] <Wilto> johnbend1r: I am not, in fact.
[14:27:04] <johnbend1r> uGoMobi: thanks man
[14:29:59] <agcolom> have a fab time tomorrow (johnbend1r, gseguin, toddmparker_)
[14:31:58] <Wilto> Somebody steal me some sweet Google shades.
[14:33:38] <gseguin> thanks agcolom!
[14:33:59] <gseguin> Wilto: pretty darn cool technology!

[14:38:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Update listview test after changing the read-only list styling. - Jasper de Groot
[14:38:45] <johnbend1r> uGoMobi: yar!
[14:39:20] <uGoMobi> johnbend1r: :D
[14:46:09] <agcolom> Ok, bedtime is coming...
[14:46:13] <agcolom> uGoMobi,
[14:46:18] <uGoMobi> yes Anne
[14:46:40] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I've asked toddmparker_ to choose some pictures... I've sent him links.
[14:47:00] <agcolom> Then if he wants them in the demo, I can do that in the morning...
[14:47:01] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:47:31] <agcolom> anyway there is a photo to the edge example at the bottom
[14:48:12] <agcolom> so he can also use that one if he wants to demo that. I'll let him know that the map now has a border...
[14:48:37] <uGoMobi> what about that text?
[14:48:47] <uGoMobi> map + lightbox
[14:48:49] <agcolom> the lightbox text?
[14:48:59] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:49:16] <agcolom> yes, I'm not sure, because it depends if we keep the map there or we put a picture...
[14:49:42] <agcolom> let me tweet him.. might be more effective (I have emailed) I think he's having lunch!
[14:50:05] <uGoMobi> map is not really a lightbox with the border and all
[14:51:28] <uGoMobi> we could already put photo popups in using the current photo and then just swap the photos tomorrow after todd picked them
[14:52:00] <uGoMobi> i mean... adjust text and create the link and the popup div
[14:52:47] <agcolom> sounds like a good plan. So i just need to swap the text and popup ?
[14:53:24] <uGoMobi> just prepair everything and then tomorrow just copy the image file and change the img src
[14:57:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/4UQmrA
[14:57:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] changed lightbox example to photo - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[14:57:48] <agcolom> ok, swapped it back to the photo
[14:58:00] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[14:58:00] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #240: FIXED in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/240/
[14:59:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok cool
[15:01:13] <agcolom> if I want to upload a picture, is it git add picture.gif and then git commit -m "added picture" and then git push upstream?
[15:01:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it's a pitty the popups aren't centered on the page :(
[15:02:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I dunno, I use GIt GUI for that
[15:02:29] <agcolom> (all that after git checkout master, git pull upstream, git rebase upstream/master)
[15:03:03] <agcolom> how do you add a file in Git GUI?
[15:03:20] <uGoMobi> I just copy image to the folder and then Git GUI finds it
[15:03:27] <uGoMobi> then I click stage to commit
[15:03:38] <uGoMobi> commit and push
[15:04:09] <uGoMobi> just click buttons, no commands :D
[15:05:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom do you have GUI installed?
[15:08:03] <agcolom> no, I don't
[15:08:20] <agcolom> I do all in command-line!
[15:08:40] <uGoMobi> I use both
[15:09:07] <uGoMobi> GUI is bit easier, because WYSIWYG
[15:09:16] <agcolom> sounds good!
[15:09:29] <agcolom> are you around tomorrow morning?
[15:09:41] <uGoMobi> but doesn't offer all possibilities
[15:10:13] <agcolom> (just in case we need to upload a picture)
[15:10:32] <uGoMobi> sure, I will check in tomorrow morning
[15:10:33] <agcolom> then you could upload the picture, and I do the text ?
[15:10:42] <agcolom> Great thx ;-)
[15:10:42] <uGoMobi> ok
[15:10:54] <agcolom> Goodnight :-)
[15:10:57] <uGoMobi> if you update text...
[15:11:01] <uGoMobi> "The framework adds small amount of margin to text elements"
[15:11:14] <agcolom> yes
[15:11:16] <uGoMobi> I think I forgot an "a" there in front of small
[15:11:27] <agcolom> Oh, I can do that now...
[15:11:30] <uGoMobi> maybe both is correct, I dunno
[15:11:45] <agcolom> a is better
[15:13:23] <agcolom> done. Sorry forgot to say thx to you

[15:15:19] <uGoMobi> thanks for fixing
[15:15:46] <agcolom> no probs, you've spotted it so that's what I meant ;-)
[15:16:07] <uGoMobi> yeah I know
[15:16:11] <uGoMobi> ok, good night Anne
