[10:46:54] <AlexSchmitz> Wilto: you around?
[10:48:10] <Wilto> AlexSchmitz: On and off; whatâ€™s up?
[10:48:53] <AlexSchmitz> Wilto: Was just curious if you saw my tweet the other day i found those 9% smashed blueberry i told you about
[10:49:24] <AlexSchmitz> Wilto: figured  ill hold on to them and if i make it down to boston anytime soon try and get them to you.
[10:49:25] <Wilto> Hah, yeah, saw that!
[10:49:43] <Wilto> Gotta get ahold of some of that stuff. I bet the fancy farmstand deal down the street from me has it.

[14:14:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl created tables (+1 new commit): http://git.io/hBjWaw
[14:14:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/tables] added the files and dependency includes for the "tables" branch. The demo is not yet functional, but includes the assets from @maggiewachs' responsive table (Filament Group). Next steps will be to rewrite this code  to use @toddparker's proposed API, and any other refactoring that makes sense. Addresses #5093 - Scott Jehl
