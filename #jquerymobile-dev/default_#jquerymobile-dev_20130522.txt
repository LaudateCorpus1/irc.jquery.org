[06:05:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[06:05:58] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[06:06:11] <arschmitz> hey hows your day going?
[06:06:24] <uGoMobi> pretty good, thanks
[06:06:32] <arschmitz> cool
[06:06:47] <arschmitz> so i got panel almost completely working outside pages lol
[06:06:59] <uGoMobi> awesome!
[06:07:08] <arschmitz> will need some css tweaks but looks like nothing major
[06:07:09] <uGoMobi> that's fast
[06:07:28] <uGoMobi> I can look into that
[06:07:43] <arschmitz> yeah only problem i know right now is dismissing by clicking on page isnt working
[06:07:47] <uGoMobi> didn't touch it much in "next" because I knew you were going to work on that
[06:07:49] <arschmitz> but should be able to fix that up
[06:08:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: biggest issue at the moment is the panel height is just panel content height
[06:08:32] <arschmitz> instead of full page height
[06:08:53] <arschmitz> but i think thats becauwe you used 100% for height if i recal
[06:08:56] <uGoMobi> yes I can image that problem pops up
[06:09:13] <uGoMobi> yes or bottom 0
[06:09:23] <uGoMobi> have to check, don't remember
[06:09:31] <arschmitz> yeah so have to come up with something else for when outside the page
[06:09:59] <arschmitz> and transition timing is a bit off the transitions work properly the timing just seems a little weird
[06:10:09] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[06:10:20] <arschmitz> so over all i think its looking pretty good
[06:10:34] <uGoMobi> great
[06:10:54] <uGoMobi> do you want me to look at something already?
[06:11:06] <arschmitz> a lot of it was just replacing static refrences to page with $(".ui-page-active")
[06:11:38] <arschmitz> no was just letting you know how it was going since you did a lot of work on the original css and probably going to be good to get your help on fixing it up
[06:12:11] <uGoMobi> I hope we can reduce the 3D-ing a bit
[06:12:29] <arschmitz> yeah that would be nice
[06:12:52] <arschmitz> everything worked well though because of how you used a wrapper for content
[06:13:01] <uGoMobi> I still remember the issues I ran into when working on the original js/css so I can look into those when you are done with your first pass
[06:13:19] <uGoMobi> do we still need that wrapper?
[06:13:24] <arschmitz> when outside the page i just skip making a wrapper and set wrapper to the page it self
[06:13:44] <uGoMobi> that sounds much better
[06:14:10] <arschmitz> yea makes things nice and simple
[06:14:27] <uGoMobi> I am almost done with "next"
[06:14:39] <arschmitz> very cool
[06:14:44] <uGoMobi> I will write an update today or tomorrow
[06:15:03] <arschmitz> sweet iv been looking at it here and there i like the flatter theme
[06:15:33] <uGoMobi> I want to update the unit tests, demo center and API docs each which at the time
[06:16:00] <uGoMobi> that might take a while so maybe you and _|Nix|_ can work on widget reviews in the "next" branch already
[06:16:02] <uGoMobi> thans
[06:16:05] <uGoMobi> thanks*
[06:16:43] <uGoMobi> I didn't touch the panel and table widgets so for those it doesn't matter if you work on master or in next
[06:16:48] <arschmitz> yeah maybe help you get through unit tests then do review while your doing docs and demos
[06:17:12] <arschmitz> because it will be hard to review widgets that are not passing tests to start :)
[06:17:34] <uGoMobi> yes true
[06:18:38] <uGoMobi> but I was thinking we could fix the tests of a specific widget so you guys can review the widget JS and then I move on to another widget
[06:19:03] <uGoMobi> just because I don't want to hold you up
[06:19:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i wouldnt really worry about holding us up too much _|Nix|_ seems like he has been really busy and iv been working on plenty of other stuff lol
[06:20:10] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[06:20:31] <arschmitz> but if you need help with tests im happy to help
[06:20:42] <uGoMobi> fixing the demo center custom css and js will take some time too
[06:20:53] <arschmitz> yeah im sure
[06:59:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are you working on panels in a branch?
[07:03:54] <arschmitz> yes but its only local right now i have not pushed it yet
[07:12:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, no problem... was just asking because there are few panel issues that I wanted to give a look for 1.3.2
[07:13:22] <arschmitz> ah yeah master should be fine for that 
[07:14:23] <uGoMobi> great

[10:41:12] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hey! Indeed ...
[10:44:01] <gseguin> toddmparker: you around?
[11:17:17] <agcolom> Good evening!
[11:25:42] <toddmparker> hi gseguin - just got in
[11:50:38] <gseguin> toddmparker: I have shift my attention and work hours to more Jive less jQuery Mobile until end of June
[11:50:59] <gseguin> toddmparker: I'll continue to work on code coverage in my free time
[11:56:41] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Good evening Jasper! Do you want me to do some testing on your new theme page?
[11:56:53] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom 
[11:57:21] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[11:57:33] <uGoMobi> thanks, but I think it's more useful to wait when I am done
[11:57:49] <agcolom> ok, no problem :-)
[11:58:30] <agcolom> toddmparker: just to let you know... I updated the icon for codiqa on the resources page. Codiqa are very happy about it :-)
[11:59:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: will let you know when I am done with the refactor, won't take long anymore
[12:02:18] <agcolom> ok, no problem. Yes, just let me know and I'll do some testing :-) Can't wait :-)
[12:09:36] <toddmparker> gseguin: ok, understand that
[12:09:46] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi 
[12:09:48] <toddmparker> and agcolom 
[12:09:58] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[12:09:58] <agcolom> Hey toddmparker :-)
[12:10:05] <toddmparker> how goes?
[12:10:12] <agcolom> we have an icons page!
[12:10:17] <toddmparker> yeah?
[12:10:27] <agcolom> http://api.jquerymobile.com/icons/
[12:10:45] <toddmparker> looks really nice
[12:11:38] <agcolom> Thanks! Wanted to do that for ages. So waited for ui to get theirs done. They haven't merged theirs yet, but we're inline with them
[12:12:15] <agcolom> Although they have a separate theming category (we've got it under reference)
[12:12:40] <agcolom> and I changed the icon for codiqa. 
[12:12:47] <uGoMobi> I am struggling a bit with group and popup theme inheritance
[12:12:48] <agcolom> They're happy about it :-)
[12:13:16] <uGoMobi> not a problem to make that work, but a problem to make it work without breaking everything else ;)
[12:13:48] <toddmparker> i bet
[12:14:38] <uGoMobi> the challenge is to make it work without a JQM page
[12:15:07] <uGoMobi> not using .ui-mobile or .ui-page in my selectors to increase specificity
[12:15:32] <toddmparker> right
[12:15:45] <toddmparker> worth figuring out if you can
