[04:45:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Collapsible set: Changed the refresh function so it first removes data object "collapsible-last" for each item before setting it on the last one. Fixes #4645 - collapsible-last not reset during a refresh. [1.1.2.] - Jasper de Groot
[04:53:44] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi!  You've done it on your own now?
[04:55:06] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[04:55:25] <uGoMobi> I committed the change yes
[04:55:47] <uGoMobi> should I not have done that?
[04:58:26] <MauriceG> It's okay. I just thought we wait for a reply.
[04:59:21] <uGoMobi> you mean, if he wanted to create a PR for it or not?
[05:18:12] <MauriceG> yes, but it's okay. Thanks!

[05:34:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up with 1.1-stable? Can I cherry-pick to it?
[05:34:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nah, I don't think so
[05:35:00] <uGoMobi> not until 1.1.1 final release
[05:35:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aha, OK ...
[05:35:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, it just sits there ...
[05:35:27] <uGoMobi> yup :)
[05:35:45] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[05:35:50] <uGoMobi> I bookmarked the commits that should be picked for 1.1.2.
[05:36:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, can you/I add two more?
[05:36:19] <uGoMobi> sure
[05:36:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Where do I go?
[05:36:53] <uGoMobi> sorry, I meant bookmarked in my own browser
[05:37:01] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK ...
[05:37:03] <uGoMobi> if you post link here I can add them
[05:37:14] <uGoMobi> no problem
[05:37:29] <_|Nix|_> Why don't we just make a branch off of 1.1-stable, and then merge it when 1.1.1 is out?
[05:37:31] <uGoMobi> we could also post the links on basecamp
[05:37:53] <uGoMobi> I dunno, there was a discussion about the best approach
[05:38:08] <uGoMobi> but I think the didnt end in a descision
[05:38:15] <uGoMobi> that*
[05:38:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I'm gonna make a branch anyway, but I'm going to keep it local.
[05:38:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just hope no commits are lost this way.
[05:38:48] <uGoMobi> yeah, I thought about that too
[05:39:59] <uGoMobi> but if I only pick my own commits in that local branch I might have to solve many conflicts later on
[05:40:15] <uGoMobi> but could be handy because at least you have to commit history
[05:40:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I recommend you do the same with your commits: git checkout -b 1.1-stable-my-cherries 1.1-stable; git cherry-pick xxxx;
[05:40:25] <uGoMobi> the*
[05:40:34] <uGoMobi> pfff.... can't type today :(
[05:44:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: don't you think it's going to give many conflicts when we all merge our local "temp" branch into 1.1-stable?
[05:45:22] <uGoMobi> depends a bit on how many commits we are looking at
[05:47:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: besides that... it should be a copy of the 1.1-stable branch, not a new branch from master
[05:47:56] <uGoMobi> or is that what  git checkout -b 1.1-stable-my-cherries 1.1-stable does?
[06:00:01] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_ gseguin johnbender _|Nix|_ agcolom MauriceG Wilto scottjehl : agenda for todays call, please update https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CAyzdT-6o9y6-U8pJ8J49P6hk0FoX1XOmBshanJ5jvI/edit#
[06:21:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You'd get the same conflicts cherry-picking one commit at a time.
[06:21:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm, yeah, that makes sense
[06:22:00] <uGoMobi> ok, will create a local branch
[06:22:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Here's what I'm thinking: There's the 1.1-stable branch, and then we all have our local branches. When it's OK to push, one of us pushes, the next one rebases and pushes, the next one rebase and pushes, and so on, until we've all rebased and pushed.
[06:22:38] <uGoMobi> ok, good idea
[06:23:10] <uGoMobi> does "git checkout -b 1.1-stable-my-cherries 1.1-stable" create a branch out of 1.1-stable instead of master?
[06:23:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[06:23:38] <uGoMobi> ok thanks, didn't know that
[06:23:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It creates a branch that starts at the HEAD of 1.1-stable.
[06:23:48] <uGoMobi> perfect
[06:30:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Weird - I can't edit the agenda ...
[06:31:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you try again?
[06:31:40] <uGoMobi> change the share settings to everyone instead of everyone with the link
[06:31:48] <uGoMobi> changed*
[06:32:14] <_|Nix|_> It's still set to "View only"
[06:32:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've requested access.
[06:35:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: should be ok now
[06:37:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep - thanks!
[09:19:14] <maxlynch> Are there any CDN's that host jQM with SSL?
[09:23:11] <maxlynch> nvm, looks like microsoft has 1.1.0 up https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.mobile/1.1.0/jquery.mobile-1.1.0.js
[10:29:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Great ... I finally get an iOS product (iPod Touch which I'm about to update to iOS 5.1.1) and I can't reproduce the positioning/sizing screenshots you sent me :(
[11:01:05] <_|Nix|_> So .... ummm ... meetin' time?
[11:01:07] <gseguin> ajpiano: could you open #jquery-meeting for the mobile team please?
[11:01:15] <uGoMobi> yup
[11:01:55] <gseguin> thanks ajpiano!
[11:02:01] <ajpiano> :)
[11:52:29] <gseguin> ajpiano: meeting over you can re-moderate #jquery-meeting, thank you!
[11:53:28] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Have a safe trip to CO!

[11:54:04] <uGoMobi> good evening _|Nix|_
[11:54:21] <_|Nix|_> The good news is that it turns out I now have an Android 2.3.5 device as well! \o/
[11:54:22] <agcolom> Good evening _|Nix|_
[11:54:31] <MauriceG> bye _|Nix|_
[11:54:32] <agcolom> Excellent!
[11:54:35] <_|Nix|_> L8R all!
[11:54:42] <agcolom> uGoMobi, just checking
[11:58:48] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ If you are still around, I cannot reproduce on 5.1
[11:58:53] <agcolom> all works well
[12:01:38] <agcolom> uGoMobi, here's a jsbin with latest: http://jsbin.com/ihawid/
[12:03:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, I will change that jsbin to it displays the result of getScreenHeight, then you can test on iOS
[12:03:28] <agcolom> I tried it with the rotation, and it seems to work well
[12:03:47] <agcolom> I'm going to test the old code now... it may be fixed.
[12:04:18] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:07:12] <agcolom> it is fixed I think! I'll comment and close.
[12:08:03] <uGoMobi> cool!
[12:08:36] <agcolom> Hey, 335 :-)
[12:15:35] <uGoMobi> actually 333 - 14 PR's = 319 :D

[12:35:44] <agcolom> it was just a tiny correction to the unit test

[12:43:42] <uGoMobi> ah ok

[13:59:13] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by scottgonzalez (1m, 42s ago): Update copyright to jQuery Foundation.
[13:59:17] <scott_gonzalez> I think I got all instances.
[14:06:57] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi! Do we need to update Wordpress as well? (http://jquerymobile.com/)
[14:08:30] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Probably a good idea.
[14:09:18] <scott_gonzalez> We don't transfer ownership of anything, so any contributions outside of jQuery Foundation should be recognized.
[14:10:21] <agcolom> Should I wait for toddmparker_ ? (I can make the change when your PR is merged?)
[14:10:35] <scott_gonzalez> sure
[14:11:05] <agcolom> In the mean time I'll check where we have the copyright and make a note, so that it gets changed everywhere at the same time...
[14:16:02] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: actually I think nearly every single file in the docs folder will need this as well...
[14:22:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that commit you had a conflict with shouldnt be picked into 1.1-stable at all :(
[14:23:31] <uGoMobi> it is a change in a test that gseguin added, but didn't pick into 1.1-stable
[14:24:35] <agcolom> ah ok
[14:24:43] <agcolom>  so we're good then ?
[14:25:43] <uGoMobi> upstream/origin is, only have some local issues now
[14:26:00] <uGoMobi> but will be fine
[14:27:04] <agcolom> ok
[14:27:13] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[14:29:32] <uGoMobi> no problem, just thought I was becomming crazy because I solved the conflict but then the commit was gone
[14:30:02] <uGoMobi> until I found out I removed the change when solving the conflict :)
[14:30:33] <agcolom> yes!!!
[14:31:12] <uGoMobi> local repo is ok now too, so it's all good now
[14:31:24] <agcolom> You're a star :-)
[14:31:38] <agcolom> And how's your work going?
[14:31:47] <uGoMobi> not ;)
[14:31:51] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:32:03] <uGoMobi> is going to be a long night again
[14:32:31] <agcolom> oh dear!
[14:32:42] <agcolom> What time do you get up then?
[14:33:54] <uGoMobi> well that depends
[14:34:28] <agcolom> Are better at working late? and sleeping in the morning?
[14:34:40] <agcolom> you ^
[14:34:59] <uGoMobi> in general better at working late
[14:35:34] <uGoMobi> but I really don't have a steady pattern
[14:35:59] <agcolom> ok, but make sure you get your work done too :-) we can't have you not paying your bills ;-)
[14:36:10] <uGoMobi> last sunday I skipped a night because I had to finish something before monday morning
[14:36:17] <agcolom> OMG!!!!
[14:36:50] <uGoMobi> so monday evening I went to bed very early
[14:37:04] <uGoMobi> and at tuesday I was fully awake at 4am
[14:37:05] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:37:24] <uGoMobi> so... it all depends
[14:38:04] <agcolom> Beware of coding very late... That's when we make crazy mistakes ;-)
[14:38:16] <uGoMobi> yeah, you are right
[14:38:33] <uGoMobi> it's really not effective
[14:38:46] <agcolom> And make sure you eat properly!
[14:38:48] <uGoMobi> better make sure you sleep well
[14:38:54] <uGoMobi> yes mom ;)
[14:38:55] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:39:02] <agcolom> (Now I probably sound like your mum!)
[14:39:10] <agcolom> yes, you beat me to it ;-)
[14:39:11] <uGoMobi> yes you do
[14:39:22] <uGoMobi> haha
