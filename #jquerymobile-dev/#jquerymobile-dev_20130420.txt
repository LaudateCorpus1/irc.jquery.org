[12:41:40] <mfranz> Anyone around have experience with collapsible set
[12:42:10] <mfranz> when I empty().append(data) new data to the collapsible set during ajax call it loses styling
[12:42:20] <mfranz> the first time it works great but after that the styling is gone

[15:44:29] <vick08> Hi Devs. Does anybody know how I can fix the following with jqm and phonegap 2.6.0? Basically, seems like Phonegap plugins give up loading because of the page transistions, it seems? I am getting this "resetting plugins due to page load"
[15:45:15] <vick08> Sorry to barge in like this but I don't seem to find a good answer anywhere on the internet, so thought someone here may know.
[22:01:29] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin my first pass at the perf stuff left the recording of times across versions as a manual excercise
[22:01:29] <b-ot> johnbender: Iâ€™ll tell gseguin about that.
[22:01:29] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[22:02:05] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin I think we should start there because the last time I did this and set something up for the recording it ended up being a huge waste of time
[22:02:05] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[22:02:06] <b-ot> johnbender: Iâ€™ll tell gseguin about that.
