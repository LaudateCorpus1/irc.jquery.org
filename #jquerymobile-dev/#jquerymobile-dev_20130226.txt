[04:50:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Pong!
[05:18:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[05:18:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We do not need to use $.widget with _handleResetForm (reset.js).
[05:18:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's enough if we use $.extend.
[05:18:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That way we do not create extra depth.
[05:19:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Only extensions that add options and/or call _super() need to be added with $.widget.
[05:19:31] <arschmitz> ok
[05:19:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Extensions that simply add new methods can be added with $.extend.
[05:20:31] <arschmitz> cool
[05:20:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, $.widget( "mobile.checkboxradio", $.extend( {}, $.mobile.behaviors.handleFormReset, { _create: function() { /* ... */ }, ... } );
[05:20:42] <_|Nix|_> Forgot a closing bracket.
[05:20:47] <arschmitz> lol
[05:21:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... I'll make the change.
[05:21:35] <arschmitz> cool
[05:21:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've also noticed something weird: If you do use /widget/ you need to copy the extension, otherwise it'll call the wrong superclass when it calls _super().
[05:22:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I had to $.widget( "mobile.xyzzy", $.mobile.xyzzy, $.extend( {}, $.mobile.behaviors.someExtension ) );
[05:22:41] <arschmitz> weird
[05:22:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe it takes the object by ref.
[05:22:58] <arschmitz> it must
[05:23:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... anyway, I'll change the form widgets over to using $.extend ...
[05:24:15] <arschmitz> doh of course it does all objects are passed by refrence in JS
[05:24:31] <arschmitz> only primitives are passed by value
[05:24:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[05:25:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: addFirstLastClasses can also be switched to $.extend.
[05:25:25] <arschmitz> yup
[05:29:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hmmm ... we have code in place to check for the presence of the _handleFormReset() function inside the widget definition before calling it. I think that's superfluous, since dependency on formReset is declared in the AMD deps.
[05:29:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's not really an optional extension ...
[05:29:42] <arschmitz> yeah if its required in amd i dont think that is needed
[05:29:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, "skip this extension if you want to re-introduce issue #nnnn" :)
[05:38:02] <arschmitz> right
[05:44:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: check this out fun piece of JS http://static.echonest.com/bonhamizer/about.html and the code is on github lol

[06:39:16] <toddmparker> Mornings
[06:40:54] <toddmparker> I'm going to be in meetings most of the day so I'm not slacking, I swear
[06:41:12] <toddmparker> Been sketching a new theme for the next release
[06:41:22] <toddmparker> Going minimal
[06:41:47] <toddmparker> How goes?
[06:46:04] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker
[06:50:24] <uGoMobi> minimal sounds good
[06:50:33] <uGoMobi> morning all
[06:51:29] <toddmparker> Yeah like android, bb10, wp7
[06:51:33] <toddmparker> iOS is the exception
[06:52:07] <toddmparker> Be fun to work on that with you
[06:56:29] <uGoMobi> yeah, curious about your sketches
[06:58:06] <uGoMobi> I think the advantage of the android and metro style is that it looks less "mobile only"
[07:00:11] <RWhitbeck> toddmparker hey jquerymobile.com still says RC 1 for the link to stable on the home page 
[07:00:37] <uGoMobi> RWhitbeck: I was about to ask toddmparker if he saw my email about that :)
[07:00:51] <toddmparker> yikes, fixing

[10:11:37] <agcolom> Wilto: Fantastic! Congratulations! 
[10:33:52] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker _|Nix|_ johnbender: Do you hook into the remove event at all?
[10:43:06] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: not that I'm aware of
[10:43:20] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:43:27] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: we could make use of it though for cleaning up dependent elements
[10:43:33] <johnbender> right now it's manual
[10:43:46] <scott_gonzalez> Well, I plan on getting rid of it.
[10:43:46] <johnbender> I'm entirely ignorant of support/efficacy 
[10:43:49] <scott_gonzalez> It's not public API.
[10:43:57] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: oh you mean in the widget?
[10:44:02] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[10:44:04] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: hmm, less sure about that
[10:44:06] <scott_gonzalez> I just wanted to make sure that doing wouldn't break mobile.
[10:44:22] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I think you should do what you need to and we'll figure it out
[10:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> I mean specially that you don't do elem.on( "remove", ... )
[10:44:33] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: oh no
[10:44:39] <johnbender> I don't think so
[10:44:40] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I had a feeling you didn't.
[10:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> Just wanted to make sure.
[10:44:55] <scott_gonzalez> So if you did, we could find a way to update your code.
[10:45:00] <johnbender> absolutely
[10:45:07] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: thanks man
[10:45:12] <scott_gonzalez> no problem
[10:46:56] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi, I have a question for you: the template for events, who should write it?
[10:47:09] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Anybody :-)
[10:47:29] <scott_gonzalez> If you bug me about it after this weekend, I'll actually do it :-)
[10:54:48] <agcolom> Oh that would be wonderful!!!! Thank you :-)
[10:55:20] <agcolom> (sorry I've been trying to reply for the last 8 minutes but I lost all connection! scott_gonzalez ^
[11:14:59] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Remember the script called turnOffPushState.js? Well, we can remove it, but only if the examples point to the latest from master. When is a good time to remove that script? 1.3.1?
[11:15:36] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hi! :)
[11:18:48] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Hi!
[11:19:26] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: , yes 1.3.1 would be a good idea then, because the examples point to 1.3.0 final
[11:22:28] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK. I'll file an issue against the API docs so we don't forget.
[11:24:26] <agcolom> That's a great idea, thanks :-)

[11:31:21] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: Thank you :-) 
[11:31:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: You're planning on removing _destroy()?
[11:32:44] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... that's how we handle the case where this.element is removed from the DOM.
[11:42:04] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I'm not sure if that's synonymous with the remove() event ...
[11:44:01] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: No, destroy/_destory are documented and important.
[11:44:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Excellent! Then we're good!

[14:38:00] <ryanneufeld> have you run in to issues with text-overflow: elipses in FF?
[14:39:26] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Yes, once. IIRC, I couldn't prevent FF from ellipsizing by setting this to "clip" ..
[14:40:04] <ryanneufeld> the issue I'm having is that it's only showing the ellips
[14:41:58] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Right. Well, that makes sense. If it has the option of only showing the ellipsis, it doesn't really need to request any room, except for the ellipsis.
[14:42:19] <ryanneufeld> but that's not what MDN says it's supposed to do
[14:42:36] <ryanneufeld> it's supposed to make looooooooooonnnnnnnnngggggggggg text => loooooooooooooo...
[14:43:10] <ryanneufeld> that's how it seems to work in chrome
[14:43:52] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: http://cl.ly/image/021H33343R2i
[14:44:36] <ryanneufeld> vs http://cl.ly/image/3s2e05382D3X
[14:44:42] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I guess you may want to stretch the <span> to fit inside its container ...
[14:45:14] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: hmm. this css is still based on jqm from pre 1.0 :P
[14:45:23] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:45:52] <ryanneufeld> I gotta find a solution
[14:46:00] <ryanneufeld> apparently we're partnering w/ Moz on this one
[14:50:19] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: apparently FF doesn't like inline-block
[14:50:23] <ryanneufeld> but inline is okay
[14:51:12] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: did you try display inline-block and vertical-align top ?
[14:51:31] <ryanneufeld> and inline doesn't work in chrome... fail
[14:51:35] <ryanneufeld> I have not
[14:51:37] <ryanneufeld> lemme try that
[14:51:46] <uGoMobi> yeah text-overflow only works on block elements
[14:52:00] <ryanneufeld> no dice
[14:52:04] <uGoMobi> :(
[14:52:11] <ryanneufeld> so much for open standards FF!
[14:52:13] <ryanneufeld> you bastards
[15:00:12] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: I just tested JQM latest on FF and ui-li-heading gets the ellipsis on FF
[15:00:26] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: okay, does it cut it off?
[15:00:41] <ryanneufeld> this is jquerymobile.com/test?
[15:01:43] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: yes
[15:01:52] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[15:01:58] <ryanneufeld> I just made a reduced fiddle
[15:02:02] <ryanneufeld> to test it further
[15:02:05] <uGoMobi> the text is cut off and at the end there is the ellipsis
[15:02:10] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/DQ5Jt/1/
[15:02:36] <uGoMobi> BTW jquerymobile.com/test/ is view.jquerymobile.com/master now
[15:02:42] <uGoMobi> but you will be redirected :)
[15:02:49] <ryanneufeld> cookl
[15:02:59] <ryanneufeld> would you mind taking a look at http://m.metrolyrics.com/
[15:03:04] <ryanneufeld> and telling me what I'm missing?
[15:03:11] <ryanneufeld> I'm not a css guy
[15:03:52] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: sure, np
[15:04:06] <ryanneufeld> Thanks, I owe you a beverage
[15:05:06] <ryanneufeld> it seems that once I hit certain width, it fails
[15:05:45] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: I don't see a problem
[15:05:55] <ryanneufeld> in FF?
[15:05:55] <uGoMobi> looking at 390px width like you did
[15:06:01] <ryanneufeld> try <380
[15:06:19] <uGoMobi> ah ok... now I see a problem
[15:06:32] <ryanneufeld> yeah, the FF OS simulator is <380 apparently
[15:06:33] <uGoMobi> or actually.. only ellipsis
[15:09:04] <ryanneufeld> http://m.metrolyrics.com/css/raw/mobile.css and http://m.metrolyrics.com/css/raw/jquery.mobile.css
[15:09:09] <ryanneufeld> is the css loading
[15:22:00] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15GodsBest opened issue #5700: Deprecated jQuery method appears in jQM 1.3.0 API code samples  02http://git.io/EfQVxA
[15:35:06] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: looks like my problem is that FF and Chrome treat inline-block very differently
[15:35:21] <ryanneufeld> so instead of using an OL, now I get to add a counter in my PHP code instead
[15:36:05] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: the vertical alignment is bit different in FF
[15:36:40] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: I can't get it to work with CSS
[15:37:03] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it's okay
[15:37:06] <ryanneufeld> I found a workaround
[15:37:24] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: I am not sure if it has to do with us setting overflow ellipsis for the parents ui-btn-text and ui-btn-inner too
[15:37:44] <ryanneufeld> well, it kinda does, but not really
[15:38:06] <ryanneufeld> basically, there is no provision in the jqm default css for what we're doing with the list view
[15:38:19] <ryanneufeld> so I added some css to our custom override
[15:38:23] <ryanneufeld> and then FF doesn't like it
[15:38:24] <ryanneufeld> :S
[15:38:30] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: there is an open ticket for the layout problem when you have an ordered list and a heading + p
[15:38:44] <ryanneufeld> was it opened by me?
[15:38:55] <ryanneufeld> since we're partnering with them for the FFOS launch I just need it to work.
[15:38:55] <uGoMobi> dunno
[15:39:01] <uGoMobi> lemme check
[15:39:34] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1609
[15:39:42] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: you commented
[15:40:35] <uGoMobi> even worked on a fix :)
[15:41:17] <ryanneufeld> ha
[15:41:18] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:41:29] <ryanneufeld> how fitting that I come back to it
[15:41:56] <uGoMobi> I rembered I looked into it before
[15:43:59] <ryanneufeld> well, for now, It's not hard to add a counter and spit out the numbers :S
[15:45:02] <uGoMobi> yeah, seems like adding a number at the left and an ellipsis at the right is just a bit too much for FF
[15:50:37] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: I got a fix
[15:50:51] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: wat
[15:51:08] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: margin-left -1.3em (to negate the space used by the number)
[15:51:20] <uGoMobi> text-indent: 1.3em
[15:52:14] <uGoMobi> you have to see what vertical-align setting works best
[15:52:43] <uGoMobi> but the problem is that FF doesn't take the space used by the list number into account
[15:52:56] <ryanneufeld> ah
[15:54:05] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: that didn't seem to solve it for me
[15:54:20] <ryanneufeld> are you adding that to the .ui-li-heading?
[15:54:36] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: yes
[15:54:52] <ryanneufeld> oh, wait, -1.3
[15:54:54] <ryanneufeld> derp
[15:55:44] <uGoMobi> :)
[15:57:11] <uGoMobi> I think vertical-align: text-bottom works best on FF but you would have to check how that looks on WebKit browsers
[15:57:16] <uGoMobi> and IE
[16:03:09] <ryanneufeld> thanks uGoMobi, you rock
[16:03:21] <uGoMobi> np
[16:03:25] <ryanneufeld> I have something I can show the peeps around here, and it looks good too
[16:03:33] <uGoMobi> cool
[16:03:36] <ryanneufeld> not how i was expecting to spend my afternoon lol

[16:09:52] <ryanneufeld> That'll go into production tomorrow
