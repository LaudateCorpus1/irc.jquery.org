[05:03:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] [popup unit tests] Making sure popups are destroyed and re-created correctly - Gabriel Schulhof
[05:45:21] <uGoMobi_Jasper> good morning/afternoon all
[07:25:26] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3444 can be closed as not an issue / won't fix
[07:25:26] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3444 on jquery-mobile (dotnetwise; 3m, 3w ago): Html5BoilerPlate template or any a:visited & a:hover breaks jqm
[07:26:34] <toddparker> uGoMobi_Jasper: is this related to your pull for the links?
[07:26:46] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: no it is not
[07:26:57] <toddparker> oh, just catching up. it's not
[07:26:59] <toddparker> right
[07:27:36] <toddparker> I agree with your assessment now that I've read this thread
[07:29:07] <toddparker> seems like we'd need to add a fair amount of new rules to deal with this on our end
[07:29:36] <toddparker> though setting these as global defaults is pretty common in a stylesheet
[07:29:38] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: yes and where does it end...
[07:29:52] <Wilto> …Yeah, I’m two ways about it.
[07:30:04] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: cant reset all possible custom rules that might have been added
[07:30:13] <Wilto> 1) It’s common enough that, yeah, it should be patched up. 2) It’s custom CSS. Custom CSS stands to break things.
[07:30:32] <toddparker> agree with that…but like Wilto says, this is sort of CSS 101
[07:31:40] <toddparker> guessing  that anyone who sets these basic default will run into issues, not just in BP
[07:31:50] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes indeed
[07:32:03] <toddparker> think i might be talking myself into doing this
[07:33:06] <toddparker> uGoMobi_Jasper / Wilto - what's your vote guys? we're probably the 3 to decide CSS stuff like this
[07:33:20] <Wilto> Yeeeah, I’m convinced.
[07:33:31] <uGoMobi_Jasper> when someone uses normalize.css he migth run into issues too
[07:33:55] <Wilto> I’m not so worried about saying, like, “fix everything that could happen with a reset.”
[07:34:31] <Wilto> Though we should drop the HTML5 Doc reset and Normalize in there.
[07:36:03] <uGoMobi_Jasper> ok we could look into possible issues with those common ones first
[07:37:10] <Wilto> Yeah. Not much further than that, though.
[07:37:16] <toddparker> Wilto: you mean to just do a bit of testing, not that we're going to include those, right?
[07:37:25] <Wilto> Oh, yeah. Just to test.
[07:37:49] <toddparker> yeah, I wouldn't go overboard but this does seem like such a basic style thing that we should try and protect our buttons from inheritance issues
[07:38:22] <uGoMobi_Jasper> but when you look at it from another angle...
[07:38:50] <uGoMobi_Jasper> there is no use for those people to leave the rule in their h5bp css
[07:39:52] <uGoMobi_Jasper> because they are meant to style regular links but that wont apply cos JQM has rules for .ui-link
[07:40:02] <toddparker> gseguin: removing the # in the URL on iOS seems to have fixed quite a few issues. Nice.
[07:40:46] <toddparker> uGoMobi_Jasper: I can see that point for sure.
[07:40:59] <toddparker> that's why I originally was going to just close this
[07:41:37] <toddparker> thinking we might want to add some notes about those theme classes in the theme page and the links page
[07:42:59] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes something like that and maybe add some info about it in the docs
[07:43:29] <uGoMobi_Jasper> with 'it' i mean using JQM together with h5bp or normalize
[07:44:50] <uGoMobi_Jasper> my opinion is that it doesn't feel good to add quite a lot css to reset possible custom css that doesnt do anything in the first place
[07:44:55] <toddparker> I agree that using a boilerplate or normally doesn't seem recommended
[07:45:07] <toddparker> agree with that
[07:45:39] <toddparker> this just seems like a case where most people will try this. now if the rules are pretty heavy, we can re-evaluate
[07:46:09] <toddparker> mind mocking up a single swatch w/ these changes for evaluation
[07:47:04] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yeah no problem
[07:48:12] <uGoMobi_Jasper> will have another look at h5bp and normalize to see what other issues people might run into
[07:53:06] <Wilto> I can’t imagine there will be _too_ many issues.
[08:05:05] <uGoMobi_Jasper> Wilto: you are right
[08:05:55] <uGoMobi_Jasper> if there are issues it would be in form elements if that has not been checked before
[08:07:15] <uGoMobi_Jasper> besides that only the issue i see is the one with buttons inheriting the styling links in h5bp css
[08:45:16] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: Wilto: http://pastebin.com/8Vdsc1gy
[08:45:59] <Wilto> Anything burst into flames, uGoMobi_Jasper?
[08:46:10] <uGoMobi_Jasper> nah not really
[08:47:36] <uGoMobi_Jasper> rule is already there for ui-link-inherit ... we have to add selectors
[08:48:26] <Wilto> Cool; I had a feeling we’d be close to good.
[08:48:52] <Wilto> You working on that stuff now, or should I grab it when I have some time free?
[08:49:27] <uGoMobi_Jasper> no, you can leave it
[08:49:46] <Wilto> Cool, cool.
[08:50:07] <uGoMobi_Jasper> thats what i am going to do too :)
[08:55:42] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:56:13] <uGoMobi_Jasper> gseguin: good morning
[08:56:19] <gseguin> toddparker: should I cherry-pick that fix to 1.1-stable ?
[08:56:33] <Wilto> Good morning with four minutes to spare, gseguin.
[08:57:11] <gseguin> heh :)
[08:58:15] <gseguin> Wilto: the builder's got something messed up
[08:58:27] <gseguin> first it include twice the button css
[08:58:29] <Wilto> “dammit scott” etc.
[08:58:33] <Wilto> Oof.
[08:58:36] <Wilto> That’s weird.
[08:58:51] <gseguin> and then something is going on with the order in which the script are laid out
[08:58:59] <gseguin> I'm looking into it
[08:59:51] <Wilto> Try kicking the server. That’s what I do.
[09:00:35] <gseguin> I'm going to install H9RBS.js on it
[09:00:47] <gseguin> maybe that'll fix everything
[09:01:17] <Wilto> What CAN’T it fix?
[09:02:01] <Wilto> It’ll appify your node, sure—but in the process, it will also NODIFY YOUR APPS.
[10:33:02] <toddparker> gseguin: yes, I think so
[10:33:17] <gseguin> toddparker: johnbender voted +1 already
[10:33:28] <toddparker> heh, ok
[10:33:39] <toddparker> topics for today's call?
[10:33:42] <toddparker> let me know
[10:33:53] <gseguin> builder broken
[10:34:34] <Wilto> Second order of business: Wilto is very tired.

[12:35:10] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes anne
[12:35:19] <uGoMobi_Jasper> looking at your great examples
[12:36:13] <agcolom> Thanks I was keep to get that to work!
[12:36:48] <agcolom> I'll work on the video example at the weekend... Then if you have some ideas, then we can merge everything on a nice page...
[12:37:40] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes
[12:37:41] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Also, lemme know if I need to change anything in the widget.
[12:37:47] <agcolom> I'm really busy at the moment at work, so that's why i've been just playing around...
[12:38:24] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Actually, that's the best way to find bugs - when you want things to just work, and you don't have time to devise workarounds ...
[12:38:54] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ Well my aim is to work with what we've got and see what people can do with it. I don't want ot give you extra work, and so far it's been really good
[12:39:16] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: It's not extra work if you find that something breaks ...
[12:39:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Also, if you see places where things can be made better, lay it on me ...
[12:39:39] <agcolom> The hard bit was to have the horizontally centered map div in the popup!
[12:39:56] <agcolom> Yes, if I find anything, I'll let you know...
[12:40:06] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, I'm noticing with the photo that there's some space at the bottom ...
[12:40:17] <uGoMobi_Jasper> _|Nix|_: thats easy to fix
[12:40:23] <agcolom> Yes, Jasper had a great fix ofr it
[12:40:28] <uGoMobi_Jasper> add vertical align middle to the img element
[12:40:34] <uGoMobi_Jasper> and its gone

[12:41:07] <agcolom> I use that for the map actually also, and I have had to use a left border to the map div
[12:41:34] <agcolom> I thought it was nice to keep a white padding and the cool rounded corner...
[12:41:47] <uGoMobi_Jasper> anne, if we run into those kind of issues i will add custom css to fix and gabriel can merge later
[12:41:58] <agcolom> so I added a thin border to the map to make it look sharp and clean
[12:43:20] <uGoMobi_Jasper> i like that on pics too
[12:43:49] <uGoMobi_Jasper> no border even
[12:44:30] <uGoMobi_Jasper> right now i see rounded corners behind the photo example
[12:45:10] <agcolom> yes, maybe we can have several examples of the same thing using different borders, padding, etc
[12:45:50] <agcolom> yes, I think Todd removed it but I was branched off and I have to look back and remove the rounded corner there
[12:45:51] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes good idea, to show you can customize it to your own style
[12:45:53] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I'm not sure exactly why, but sometimes the popup container is too small ...
[12:46:12] <toddparker> sounds good all
[12:46:35] <uGoMobi_Jasper> i think we just have to take notes when we see things that can be improved
[12:46:42] <uGoMobi_Jasper> and then fix them all at once
[12:46:47] <agcolom> Hi Todd, do you remember which jsbin you were on when you removed the rounded corner?
[12:46:57] <uGoMobi_Jasper> regarding css i mean
[12:47:05] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: did you see my comment that if you click on a link in a popup that goes to another popup (see your menu example), it always does pop and ignores the transition
[12:47:31] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: thats why i dont want us to create examples in jsbin... all those versions :|
[12:48:13] <toddparker> i know
[12:48:16] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Where was your comment?
[12:48:26] <toddparker> jet start committing page to the branch
[12:48:36] <toddparker> here in IRC
[12:48:37] <agcolom> Yes, it's because I didn't want to bring in my mac book pro at work (too heavy :-( ) and I have no software yet on my mac book air....
[12:49:44] <toddparker> agcolom: here it is: http://jsbin.com/okehir/67
[12:49:56] <toddparker> just add data-corners="false" to the popup
[12:49:59] <agcolom> Thank you :-)
[12:50:25] <uGoMobi_Jasper> i understand anne and jsbin is good for trying out
[12:50:36] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Sorry - I missed it. What exactly is happening?
[12:50:36] <agcolom> Yes :-)
[12:51:00] <agcolom> Have to go help with my daughter's homework... See you later....
[12:51:24] <uGoMobi_Jasper> ok good night anne
[12:51:33] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: If you open a popup that has transition set to "slide" from another popup, it will do a "pop" instead of a "slide"?
[12:52:55] <_|Nix|_> Woah ... WTF?! popup placement is waaay of in FF ...
[12:55:35] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: that is what i saw, yes
[12:56:47] <toddparker> all the buttons at the bottom have different transitions and they all pop
[12:56:57] <toddparker> the first menu has fade on every link and they fade
[12:57:09] <toddparker> sorry, they pop
[12:57:26] <toddparker> seems like data-transition doesn't work here
[12:59:04] <toddparker> in the demo page, i don't see any transitions specified on each link for your transition demos:
[12:59:08] <toddparker> <p>Popup windows can have various transitions:
[12:59:09] <toddparker>               <a href="#transitionExample-pop" data-role="button" data-inline="true" data-rel="popup">Pop</a>
[12:59:10] <toddparker>               <a href="#transitionExample-slideup" data-role="button" data-inline="true" data-rel="popup">Slide up</a>
[12:59:10] <toddparker>               <a href="#transitionExample-slidedown" data-role="button" data-inline="true" data-rel="popup">Slide down</a>
[12:59:23] <toddparker> ooooh, you're looking for this on the popup, not the link?
[12:59:43] <toddparker> that's the problem
[13:00:12] <toddparker> _|Nix|_  ^^
[13:00:16] <uGoMobi_Jasper> _|Nix|_; the popup widget uses screenWidth for calculating new position... not availWidth?
[13:00:37] <toddparker> the convention is to add the transition on the _link_ not the dialog/popup
[13:01:18] <toddparker> this post will make your brain melt: http://tripleodeon.com/2011/12/first-understand-your-screen/
[13:01:31] <toddparker> we all need to know this craziness
[13:03:12] <toddparker> http://tripleodeon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/table.html
[13:03:39] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes i bookmarked that table
[13:04:05] <toddparker> was just re-reading to see if he even has a recommendation for the best way to capture width
[13:04:41] <uGoMobi_Jasper> i just thought we use availWidth elsewhere in the code
[13:04:41] <toddparker> window.outerWidth?
[13:05:11] <uGoMobi_Jasper> actually that something had been changed from screenWidth to availWidth
[13:05:39] <toddparker> heh
[13:05:44] <toddparker> this stuff is madness
[13:07:02] <uGoMobi_Jasper> let me check first before I say more on this topic :)
[13:07:21] <toddparker> if you have time to re-read that stuff and report back...
[13:20:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Oh, OK ... transition is a popup option ...
[13:20:49] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... but, I guess I can modify it so it can grab the transition from the button ...
[13:20:55] <agcolom> Hi, I'm back, homework is finished :-)
[13:21:26] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: then popup shouldn't have a transition option ...
[13:21:51] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The transition should be passed to open() ...
[13:22:16] <agcolom> I was wondering, is there any plan to add a triangle to a popup acting as an arrow pointing to an element on the page (or is that too much like iOS popup?)
[13:22:45] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: http://web-ui-fw.github.com/#ctxpopup-demo
[13:23:08] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's not part of jquery mobile currently, but the topic has come up before.
[13:23:09] <agcolom> nice :-)
[13:23:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That widget can be a subclass of popup, now that we have updated our widget factory.
[13:23:39] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: But probably not in 1.2 ...
[13:23:48] <agcolom> ok. I'd make the triangle bigger on the big screen
[13:23:55] <agcolom> Yes, not for 1.2
[13:24:19] <agcolom> It's nice to release things slowly... You don't want too much in one go.
[13:24:24] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, do you want me to remove the transition option?
[13:25:05] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... and modify the docs to say that you're supposed to specify the transition as a parameter to open and/or the link that opens the popup?
[13:25:26] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, open( x, y, transition )?
[13:27:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Add it to the feature requests on the wiki, if you think it might be worth it.
[13:29:03] <agcolom> sure, will do.
[13:36:35] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: i want to keep the transition option, but make it follow the convention we used for dialogs
[13:36:48] <toddparker> you specify data-transition on the _link_
[13:37:00] <toddparker> that's why i though it was broken
[13:37:06] <toddparker> you look for this on the popup
[13:37:17] <toddparker> unless i'm reading this wrong
[13:40:06] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: But then, if there's a transition option set, we still need to pass x, y, and transition to open, because the transition passed at open may be different from the transition option set on the popup.
[13:41:09] <_|Nix|_> Also, major fux0rage ... ever since I added the max-width: 90% to the popup, either FF or google-chrome will place the popup horizontally in the middle of the screen :-S
[13:43:34] <_|Nix|_> Oh no ... jquery doesn't know how to calculate max-width on google chrome ... it returns 90 - which is what I set in the CSS, i.e., 90%, but on FF it returns the actual 90% of the window ...
[13:43:51] <gseguin> johnbender: is that a real test failure?
[13:44:41] <agcolom> Quick question. When I saw the new weather app on my iPod Touch, with the possibility to open-up the current day and view by the hour for the first 12h or so, it reminded me of the collapsibles, and I thought it might be useful to add the possibility to have count bubble(s) to collapsible headings...??
[13:46:21] <_|Nix|_> I'm afraid I might have to calculate max width inside js, and not use CSS ...
[13:56:30] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone... exam marking time for me...
