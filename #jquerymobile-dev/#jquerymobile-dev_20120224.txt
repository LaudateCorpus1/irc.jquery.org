[13:20:11] <Wilto> Woah, Jenkins—easy there, brobot.
[13:40:01] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3631
[13:40:02] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3631 on jquery-mobile, reported by jasonparallel (21h, 29m ago): Error Calling Close Method Of Dialog "cannot call methods on dialog prior to initialization"
[13:40:31] <johnbender> Wilto: are we wrapping the page markup?
[13:40:39] <johnbender> when we create dialogs?
[14:05:09] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #530: SUCCESS in 24 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/530/
[14:26:13] <johnbender> gseguin: are you working on the popstate issue?
[14:26:44] <johnbender> gseguin: if not I'll grab that one
[15:05:13] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #531: SUCCESS in 24 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/531/
[15:34:55] <Wilto> johnbender: The header/content/footer? We were at one stage, yeah—Scott might have rolled that back at some point?
[15:59:09] <johnbender> Wilto: well changing the markup is an issue
[15:59:56] <johnbender> Wilto: since people write code that pulls dom elements using specific selectors and then they run the widget methods that way
[16:00:26] <johnbender> Wilto: so in this case the thing he's selecting on is no longer the element that you would use to call .dialog('foo') on
[16:00:29] <johnbender> that is
[16:00:38] <johnbender> by changing the element we've broken peoples existing code
[16:04:57] <Wilto> Uh oh.
[16:05:04] <Wilto> I mean, that was pre-1.0, I believe.
[16:05:12] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #532: SUCCESS in 24 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/532/
[16:06:03] <johnbender> Wilto: are you sure? In that ticket he says it works fine with 1.0.1
[16:06:21] <johnbender> I thought it might have been part of the refactor?
[16:06:31] <johnbender> but I guess it was the dialog center/shrink?
[16:12:39] <Wilto> Preeeetty sure… I can dig into it, but I’m the Mayor of Meetingtowne today.
[16:12:46] <Wilto> Prolly not until Monday.
[16:14:37] <johnbender> Wilto: cool
[16:15:02] <johnbender> Wilto: I'll take a look real quick I can prolly figure it out
[16:16:07] <johnbender> Wilto: 1ffc6b00
[16:16:13] <johnbender> the date is the 29th of november
[16:16:21] <johnbender> that's 15 days after 1.0
[16:16:36] <johnbender> or at least that's what I recall
[16:19:12] <Wilto> DAMMIT, ME
[16:19:20] <Wilto> Wait.
[16:19:30] <Wilto> I wonder if that’s another change, apart from the one I’m thinking of.
[16:20:00] <johnbender> Wilto: well the dialog wrap has the ui-dialog class
[16:20:13] <Wilto> Mmyup that’s mine.
[16:20:22] <johnbender> where as before it was the ui-dialog-page
[16:20:44] <johnbender> where as before it was the thing that currently has the ui-dialog-page that had the ui-dialog
[16:20:47] <johnbender> that is
[16:20:51] <johnbender> the widgets this.element
[16:21:13] <johnbender> I didn't even think about that when we started making changes
[16:21:34] <Wilto> Hell.
[16:21:41] <Wilto> Yeah, never occurred to me.
[16:21:53] <johnbender> that the generated markup is an entry point for our api because of the way widgets work
[16:22:04] <johnbender> Wilto: we'll have to ask everyone if they've made similar changes
[16:22:09] <johnbender> I'll send out a psa
[16:22:11] <johnbender> lawl
[16:22:15] <johnbender> release candidate on monday
[16:22:43] <Wilto> https://encrypted-tbn1.google.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRovAge9Vd_hPte_3ek3qh0Jn9QtNyG5MnQwgDOmRUq7OioNHEO

[16:24:52] <johnbender> Wilto: https://gist.github.com/c5d8bb7e973e4bffa9de
[16:25:05] <johnbender> WEEEEEE!
[16:25:07] <johnbender> :D
[16:27:04] <Wilto> JAVA SCRIPTS
[16:27:11] <Wilto> i am so goddamned tired
[16:27:19] <johnbender> I'm with you there guy
[16:27:37] <johnbender> I was right on the verge of passing out last night at 10pm and then I stayed up for another 2 hours working on that gist lol
[16:46:35] <johnbender> Wilto: absolute worst case we can roll back that change
[16:46:47] <johnbender> but I doubt that will be necessary
[16:46:54] <johnbender> we just have to make a note of it the release
[16:47:08] <johnbender> and any other places where the markup will have changed
[16:47:22] <johnbender> s/will have/has/
