[03:24:26] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Have you guys tried popups on Android 2.3.5? They don't work! It seems I'm not getting the hashchange event when the user dismisses the popup.
[03:25:04] <_|Nix|_> ... so it fails on that ...
[03:39:12] <_|Nix|_> Do we even have to support Android 2.3.5?
[03:40:53] <_|Nix|_> Does anyone else have an Android 2.3.5 phone?

[07:37:00] <gabejacobs> How does one make javascript run on a page that is loaded through ajax? (a dialog for example)
[07:37:06] <gabejacobs> uGoMobi: hi again :)
[07:37:43] <uGoMobi> hi gabejacobs
[07:38:19] <uGoMobi> gabejacobs: put your script in the head and bind to the pageinit event
[07:38:49] <uGoMobi> $(#pageid).live( "pageinit", function() { }
[07:39:03] <gabejacobs> Ok, thanks I'll try
[07:39:31] <uGoMobi> see also http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-scripting.html
[07:40:49] <uGoMobi> and of course I forgot the ); at the end of my example ^^^
[07:41:48] <gabejacobs> it should be like this right $(#pageid).live( "pageinit", function() { });
[07:44:28] <gabejacobs> This isn't working for me right now http://i.imgur.com/2d97P.png
[07:44:32] <uGoMobi> yeah, and the selector #pageid between quotes
[07:45:18] <gabejacobs> (I'll change it back when I get it working)
[07:45:29] <gabejacobs> i chaged it to document for now
[07:47:03] <uGoMobi> do you load jQuery 1.7.1? does it work with .on() instead of .live() ?
[07:47:56] <uGoMobi> it's really hard to see why something is not working when you see only a small code snippet
[07:48:33] <uGoMobi> better to put code in JSBin template if you want someone to look at it
[07:49:55] <gabejacobs> yeah, ok, thanks
[07:53:51] <uGoMobi> gabejacobs: here it does work http://jsbin.com/ehutuz/5/edit#html
[07:54:32] <gabejacobs> I had to put the script within the page tag (Probably the wrong way to do it)
[07:54:35] <gabejacobs> but that got it to work
[07:54:37] <uGoMobi> I used .on() but .live() still works as well
[07:56:29] <uGoMobi> ok, strange but like I said... have to see whole thing before I can something usefull about it
[07:59:07] <gabejacobs> right
[09:05:23] <johnbender> hallo all!

[09:45:20] <bot-t> (408 hours ago) <gseguin> tell toddparker: I applied both patches suggested in that ticket and it's much faster on iPad3 and does not crash though it I could not get it to crash before applying scott's patch either
[09:45:34] <toddparker> uGoMobi: you were a cherry picking machine this weekend
[09:52:36] <toddparker> johnbender: welcome back
[09:52:47] <toddparker> this week, i'd like to release 1.1.1 since nothing critical came in
[09:53:08] <toddparker> i'd also like to button up the popup positioning and do a final review so we can release 1.2 alpha
[09:53:15] <toddparker> so yeah, plenty to do :)
[09:56:22] <johnbender> toddparker: cool
[09:57:28] <gseguin> hey toddparker
[09:58:07] <gseguin> johnbender: I think there has been a few doc checkins into 1.1-stable

[10:01:09] <toddparker> excellent agcolom
[10:01:10] <agcolom> (but kept the number of commits to a minimum!)
[10:01:56] <uGoMobi> toddparker: would be nice if @frequent is going to create PR's :)
[10:03:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin: do you have time to explain me something about the widget factory
[10:03:47] <uGoMobi> ?
[10:03:58] <agcolom> toddparker: Thanks :-) quick question: a few demo files have jQuery Mobile Framework (and not jQuery Mobile Docs) in their title. Do we want to keep ti this way or change to Docs? Example:  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed-forms.html
[10:03:59] <uGoMobi> more specific... options and data-attributes

[11:32:56] <tbenzige> agcolom: you around?
[11:33:08] <tbenzige> or anyone else who can help me with list views?
[11:33:28] <agcolom> I'm here:-)
[11:33:35] <agcolom> Hi!
[11:39:36] <agcolom> tbenzige ^ Hi! How can I help?
[11:42:43] <tbenzige> agcolom: so i'm trying to get TR working with 1.1.1
[11:42:56] <agcolom> yes
[11:43:11] <tbenzige> and i tried using the same markup from older versions of jqm in the iframe that TR uses, and the list views are broken
[11:43:18] <agcolom> uGoMobi are you around?
[11:43:27] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:43:41] <tbenzige> agcolom: https://gist.github.com/4939e0104fce12b86897
[11:43:44] <agcolom> Tyler has a question on listviews
[11:43:55] <tbenzige> it's actually a control group i guess
[11:44:02] <tbenzige> but i want it styled as a list view
[11:44:37] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: you mean vertical controlgroup
[11:44:43] <tbenzige> yes
[11:44:50] <uGoMobi> in what way are they broken?
[11:44:56] <tbenzige> http://awes0.me/tr-bug.png
[11:45:14] <tbenzige> BUT, if i remove a certain class from the div inside the fieldset, it's fixed
[11:45:18] <uGoMobi> i see, they don't get width
[11:45:36] <uGoMobi> a TR specific class?
[11:46:06] <tbenzige> well, i can do that as well, but here's the weird thing:
[11:46:08] <uGoMobi> does that class has width or display properties?
[11:46:30] <tbenzige> each swatch that i'm displaying has a different number of nested divs inside the fieldset
[11:46:38] <tbenzige> with a class of ui-controlgroup-controls
[11:46:47] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:46:54] <tbenzige> it most likely has something to do with the way i'm appending these swatches
[11:47:14] <tbenzige> and maniuplating the markup, but i'd just thought i'd ask
[11:47:53] <uGoMobi> if I inspect the code of the current TR do I see that class?
[11:48:02] <uGoMobi> the one you had to remove
[11:49:35] <tbenzige> hmm… let me check
[11:49:41] <tbenzige> i think a CSS fix is easiest
[11:49:56] <tbenzige> i need to take the time to redo how i'm appending/manipulating the markup
[11:50:25] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: so when i inspect the current TR markup, that div inside the fieldset is not there at all
[11:51:10] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: yes, now it is fieldset > li
[11:51:55] <tbenzige> yeah, but with 1.1.1, it's fieldset > div.ui-controlgroup-ui-controlgroup-controls > li
[11:52:11] <tbenzige> sometimes it's fieldset > div.ui-controlgroup-ui-controlgroup-controls > div.ui-controlgroup-ui-controlgroup-controls > div.ui-controlgroup-ui-controlgroup-controls > div.ui-controlgroup-ui-controlgroup-controls > div.ui-controlgroup-ui-controlgroup-controls > li
[11:52:33] <tbenzige> haha sorry if that's confusing. what i mean is that it's repeatedly nesting the inner ui-controlgroup-controls div
[11:52:42] <uGoMobi> huh
[11:52:56] <uGoMobi> that sounds like a bug
[11:53:14] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: well, it's tough to determin if it's my bug or JQM's
[11:53:19] <agcolom> ok, I've put your code in a jsbin, but it needs a lot more in there to reproduce, so not sure that's helpful: http://jsbin.com/omacox/239/
[11:53:24] <uGoMobi> if I just put your code in a JSBin it renders fine http://jsbin.com/otepum/238/
[11:53:26] <tbenzige> because I'm manipulating markup after load, i have to do some funky stuff
[11:53:37] <uGoMobi> I see
[11:53:41] <tbenzige> i found the fix to the way it LOOKS
[11:54:02] <tbenzige> if i remove the data-role=fieldcontain from the outside div it looks great
[11:54:12] <tbenzige> but, the repeated divs are still there
[11:54:30] <uGoMobi> so that's still wrong
[11:54:32] <agcolom> Where can we see the real code?
[11:55:24] <uGoMobi> i guess you are working in a local branch tbenzige ?
[11:58:13] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: yeah
[11:58:41] <tbenzige> ill push it up to master so you can take a look
[12:00:45] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: ok
[12:03:01] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: ok you can do a pull now
[12:03:21] <tbenzige> have you pulled before?
[12:03:29] <uGoMobi> nope, have to clone first
[12:03:42] <tbenzige> ok. you're going to need apache set up

[12:19:21] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: really? ok
[12:19:28] <uGoMobi> yeah :(
[12:19:33] <tbenzige> i figured out that i was firing the pagecreate event myself
[12:19:42] <tbenzige> is that why we didnt see it on load?
[12:20:16] <tbenzige> so will that be fixed in 1.1.1 final?
[12:20:46] <uGoMobi> yeah, we have to fix this
[12:21:10] <uGoMobi> I do see it on load
[12:21:38] <tbenzige> is there an estimate on when 1.1.1 final is being released?
[12:21:50] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: this week
[12:22:05] <uGoMobi> I am going to fix it now
[12:22:26] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: ok
[12:22:36] <tbenzige> can you let me know when you push it up so i can grab and play with it?
[12:23:12] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: yes, will do

[13:47:38] <tbenzige> toddparker: ping
[13:49:10] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: an update here... after some more investigation I don't think it's a bug in the framework
[13:49:36] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: it has to do with the iframe
[13:51:05] <uGoMobi> it is just that because we changed something in jqm this now becomes visible
[13:52:47] <uGoMobi> more specific... before we only wrapped the controlgroup elements in another div controlgroup-controls if there was a legend, now we always do that
[13:53:35] <uGoMobi> because the TR preview swatches don't have a legend we only see this now
[14:13:21] <agcolom> toddparker, if you're still around, any idea on that copyright question?
[14:15:24] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: any idea why the ui-controlgroup-controls are being wrapped over and over again though?
[14:17:15] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: In a normal situation the controlgroup function is called once, in case of the TR there are 6 calls to the function for each swatch
[14:18:19] <uGoMobi> so the wrap inner function is execited 6 times as well
[14:18:31] <uGoMobi> no idea yet what is causing it
[14:19:10] <uGoMobi> executed* ^
[14:24:12] <agcolom> I can see 6 elements, could it be that they are somehow inside each other because of something not closed instead of one after the other (sorry of that doesn't make sense ;-)
[14:24:24] <agcolom> ?
[14:24:47] <uGoMobi> agcolom: no, that is not it
[14:24:58] <uGoMobi> there are 2 controlgroups in each swatch
[14:25:04] <agcolom> ok
[14:25:11] <uGoMobi> and each one is enhanced 3 times
[14:25:28] <uGoMobi> the controlgroup wraps the buttons inside it in a div
[14:25:33] <uGoMobi> that is done 3 times as well
[14:25:53] <agcolom> ok!
[14:25:54] <uGoMobi> while it should be done only one time
[14:26:14] <uGoMobi> the issue might be the fact id's are not unique in the TR
[14:26:25] <agcolom> yes!
[14:26:29] <uGoMobi> looks like all swatches use same markup = same id's
[14:26:44] <agcolom> or of the library is loaded more than once
[14:27:06] <uGoMobi> but if I test in JSBin with multiple controlgroups with not unique ID's the issue doesn't occur
[14:27:40] <uGoMobi> when the library is loaded multiple times it just overrides the existing one
[14:27:48] <agcolom> is there an online version I can have a look at? (you can email me on basecamp)
[14:28:10] <agcolom> I've had cases where it caused duplication
[14:28:19] <uGoMobi> no, sorry I have it local
[14:28:26] <agcolom> I can have a look to show you...
[14:28:59] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: so should i try using unique IDs?
[14:28:59] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[14:29:41] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: it is worth trying, but like I said... same ID's in a JSBin didn't give the same problem
[14:29:58] <uGoMobi> of course it's always better to have unique ID's :)
[14:31:20] <tbenzige> hmmm. does it have to do with the fact that i'm explicitly triggering the pagecreate event?
[14:33:19] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: that might be the cause
[14:34:40] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: not so sure… i think i was already using unique IDs
[14:34:50] <tbenzige> you're talking about the radio and checkbox in the first fieldset right?
[14:35:15] <uGoMobi> yeah, in the first two controlgroups
[14:35:50] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: the id's of the inputs/labels inside it
[14:36:18] <uGoMobi> but I don't think that's the problem anyway
[14:36:34] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: they are already unique
[14:39:52] <uGoMobi> yeah you're right
[14:40:03] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: i don't know if you already said this, but whenever I add a new swatch, it's wrapping the ui-controlgroup-controls again
[14:40:21] <tbenzige> every single one gets wrapped one more time when i add any new swatch
[14:40:54] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: that's interesting
[14:41:36] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: when you add a swatch... is pagecreate called again?
[14:44:19] <tbenzige> yes
[14:44:39] <tbenzige> uGoMobi: ^ I have to call pagecreate so the markup of the newly added swatch gets updated.
[14:44:55] <uGoMobi> aha
[14:45:21] <uGoMobi> now I get it
[14:47:37] <uGoMobi> this is something we have to fix in the JQM code
[14:53:46] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile TestSwarm Master build #8: STILL FAILING in 4 min 5 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20TestSwarm%20Master/8/
[15:14:03] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: I got it fixed
[15:14:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 5 new commits to master: http://git.io/YAlwVA
[15:14:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] begin normalizing unit test directory names - John Bender
[15:14:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] remove top level suite (iframes) - John Bender
[15:14:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] normalize button markup test directory name - John Bender
[15:15:29] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: but I have to discuss if we are going to land this in 1.1.1. final
[15:17:15] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: what I can do for now is adding the fix to the code in the TR repo
[15:17:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it depends on what it is, but my guess is we want to leave 1.1.1 nearly the same as the RC
[15:17:47] <johnbender> well
[15:17:50] <johnbender> exactly the same
[15:17:59] <johnbender> but again I don't know what the change is
[15:18:04] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah, I know
[15:18:16] <uGoMobi> johnbender: it's in the controlgroup function
[15:18:24] <johnbender> hrm
[15:18:38] <uGoMobi> the elements are wrapped in a div "ui-controlgroup-controls"
[15:19:27] <uGoMobi> when create is triggered again, the wrapping is done again as well
[15:20:12] <uGoMobi> result is ui-controlgroup-controls nested in ui-controlgroup-controls
[15:20:16] <johnbender> yah
[15:20:26] <johnbender> we've had this discussion about "checking" every time
[15:20:37] <johnbender> especially since you can trigger the create on a parent element
[15:20:44] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:21:05] <uGoMobi> the TR triggers it every time a swatch is added
[15:21:39] <uGoMobi> the reason this why this is only a problem now is because in 1.1.0 we only did the wrapping if there is a legend
[15:21:59] <uGoMobi> I changed this to always wrap for styling purposes
[15:21:59] <johnbender> and that's been changed I take it
[15:22:03] <johnbender> k
[15:22:16] <johnbender> yah, I would just special case it in the TR repo if possible
[15:22:31] <uGoMobi> yeah, I think that's best
[15:22:58] <uGoMobi> also because we have to think about cases where you add an element to a controlgroup..
[15:23:08] <uGoMobi> that means unwrap and then wrap again
[15:23:41] <uGoMobi> so it's something that needs a good look, not a quick fix
[15:24:39] <toddparker> tbenzige: pong
[15:25:45] <toddparker> i'd like to not change 1.1.1 at all unless there is a really critical bug
[15:25:47] <uGoMobi> johnbender: right now I have this if statement as a fix for TR: if ( $el.children().is( ":not(.ui-controlgroup-controls)" ) ) { ... wrap ... }
[15:25:54] <toddparker> tbenzige: i'd like to get that out later this week
[15:26:13] <toddparker> so whatever we need to do to get ready (or train max), let's do that
[15:26:14] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I understand, so let's just fix this for the TR
[15:26:20] <toddparker> cool
[15:26:22] <toddparker> works for me
[15:26:32] <toddparker> sorry, i wasn't able to be as much as i hoped today
[15:26:46] <toddparker> did i miss any Q's?
[15:27:12] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I think agcolom had a Q for you about copyright
[15:29:09] <toddparker> ah
[15:29:14] <toddparker> agcolom: you here?
[15:29:46] <toddparker> heading home but will try to hop on later
[15:29:50] <toddparker> uGoMobi: how goes?
[15:30:04] <toddparker> agcolom: email me re: that Q
[15:30:13] <uGoMobi> toddparker: it goes well, thanks :)
[15:30:21] <toddparker> uGoMobi: did you look at popup positioning at all?
[15:30:28] <uGoMobi> toddparker: we have to talk with _|Nix|_ about popup
[15:30:38] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:31:07] <uGoMobi> but I don't understand the logic of the code
[15:31:19] <toddparker> man, you have a billion commits
[15:31:25] <toddparker> ah, ok
[15:31:30] <toddparker> has _|Nix|_ been around?
[15:31:40] <uGoMobi> billion commits? not for the popup
[15:31:47] <toddparker> no in general recently
[15:31:52] <uGoMobi> he was today, but not now
[15:31:55] <toddparker> it's great. thanks!
[15:32:05] <toddparker> ok, let's try to track him down
[15:32:05] <uGoMobi> I will ask _|Nix|_ tomorrow
[15:32:12] <uGoMobi> at daytime here
[15:32:16] <toddparker> johnbender: if you have time, maybe you can help us look at that too
[15:32:38] <toddparker> we're looking to expose an option to center a popup in the viewport
[15:32:50] <toddparker> there is logic to do this internally but it's not exposed
[15:32:56] <johnbender> toddparker: ah
[15:33:00] <johnbender> sure
[15:33:18] <toddparker> i'd also like to get your eyes on the code in general…give it a pass and make sure it looks ready
[15:33:21] <toddparker> great johnbender
[15:33:45] <toddparker> we could have a position option that defaults to centered over the parent
[15:33:56] <uGoMobi> johnbender: there is a method to open a open with x,y as arguments
[15:33:56] <toddparker> as we do now
[15:34:02] <toddparker> but allow you to set it to window
[15:34:04] <uGoMobi> if you leave those out, the popup is centered
[15:34:21] <toddparker> ah, i didn't realize that's how it worked
[15:34:32] <uGoMobi> we have to make that an option "center"
[15:34:33] <toddparker> but we want an option here, right?
[15:34:45] <toddparker> cool
[15:34:59] <toddparker> i'd like to name it position or something like that
[15:34:59] <uGoMobi> yes, option/data-attr
[15:35:17] <toddparker> right now, we have only two values: parent, window
[15:35:25] <toddparker> or something like that
[15:35:28] <uGoMobi> yeah, data-position="center" maybe?
[15:35:36] <toddparker> but over time, we could expand to other options
[15:35:55] <toddparker> center of window?
[15:36:03] <toddparker> problem is both cebter
[15:36:04] <uGoMobi> or is that confusing with fixed toolbar's fixed/inline?
[15:36:32] <toddparker> hrm, maybe
[15:36:54] <toddparker> but it might be ok
[15:37:21] <uGoMobi> and there is that height problem.....http://ugomobi.github.com/popup/popup.html#page-b
[15:37:38] <toddparker> johnbender: the other thing i suggested is that *maybe* we could also specify an offset but that could add complexity
[15:37:40] <uGoMobi> see second example...
[15:37:45] <toddparker> right
[15:37:54] <toddparker> that needs to be set via JS right uGoMobi
[15:38:17] <uGoMobi> yes it has to do with the position logic
[15:38:26] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm all for keeping it simple
[15:38:32] <johnbender> people can request features as needed
[15:38:35] <uGoMobi> that 2nd example has a close button at the top but you cant scroll it into view
[15:38:39] <johnbender> and possibly contribute as needed
[15:38:45] <toddparker> so is this about making sure the popup fits within the window vertically?
[15:39:05] <toddparker> seems like a special case for images/maps
[15:39:17] <toddparker> because what if you have a popup with tons of text
[15:39:19] <toddparker> it
[15:39:23] <toddparker> needs to scroll
[15:39:29] <uGoMobi> yes, or at least dont center it vertical when content is too big
[15:39:32] <johnbender> ^^
[15:39:56] <toddparker> johnbender: i'm good with just exposing these two positioning options
[15:40:37] <toddparker> uGoMobi: do you want to mock up what you think would be a sensible option for that?
[15:40:54] <toddparker> not sure if that is going to get complex
[15:41:16] <uGoMobi> it might be a bit complex :(
[15:41:28] <uGoMobi> will ask _|Nix|_  tomorrow
[15:41:36] <toddparker> i guess we just need to make sure the popup has some vertical spacing
[15:41:41] <toddparker> so you can click out
[15:41:48] <toddparker> or hit the close button
[15:41:58] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:42:12] <toddparker> maybe we just bake that into the positioning logic
[15:42:27] <toddparker> thought we were supposed to leave some space all around anyway
[15:42:34] <toddparker> we do that horizontally
[15:42:37] <toddparker> already
[15:42:40] <uGoMobi> if we dont go for max 100% height, we should make sure that the container is never expanding top of page
[15:42:46] <toddparker> so maybe we just need to do the same vertically
[15:42:53] <toddparker> right
[15:42:59] <toddparker> not to the very top
[15:43:17] <uGoMobi> yeah there is 15px tolerance left/right and 30px top/bottom but the top/bottom is not honered
[15:43:18] <toddparker> but could popups just have 20px of top/bottom margin?
[15:43:26] <toddparker> i see
[15:43:41] <toddparker> so maybe that logic just needs to be fixed to respect that vertical space
[15:44:02] <gseguin> toddparker: I'm kind of in crunch mode this week with my imminent move
[15:44:03] <toddparker> the popup can be taller than the screen, but shouldn't go to the top or bottom edge
[15:44:11] <toddparker> ok gseguin
[15:44:16] <gseguin> so unless there is something red hot
[15:44:24] <toddparker> other than this popup pass, we're in good shape
[15:44:26] <toddparker> nope
[15:44:28] <uGoMobi> but that means a popup can't be higher than page height - top+bottom padding
[15:44:30] <gseguin> I'll come back on jQM tasks next week
[15:44:46] <toddparker> mostly, i need to do some blog posts and coordinate on 1.1.1 and 1.2 alpha releases
[15:44:50] <toddparker> no worries!
[15:44:58] <toddparker> uGoMobi: right
[15:45:08] <toddparker> or it makes the page taller as needed?
[15:45:12] <uGoMobi> gseguin: good luck with that!
[15:45:28] <gseguin> thanks uGoMobi
[15:46:43] <toddparker> uGoMobi: if you can work with johnbender on a suggestion for the logic for the vertical margin, that would be super
[15:46:52] <toddparker> we just want to ensure some dead space
[15:46:59] <toddparker> i gotta run, be on later!
[15:47:07] <johnbender> toddparker: sounds good
[15:47:09] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok, see you later
[15:47:14] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm pretty open to whatever you want to do
[15:47:22] <uGoMobi> although... 1am here
[15:47:32] <johnbender> uGoMobi: sleep time then :D
[15:47:56] <uGoMobi> sleeping always feels like a waste of time
[15:48:12] <uGoMobi> wish I could do without
[15:48:16] <uGoMobi> anyway...
[15:52:28] <uGoMobi> johnbender: can I ask something for that TR fix?
[15:53:10] <uGoMobi> I think I make a look branch out of 1.1-stable... apply the fix... and then, how do I get a minified JS file?
[15:53:43] <uGoMobi> can I just do that with grunt + node.js?
[15:53:46] <johnbender> uGoMobi: npm install; node node_modules/.bin/grunt js
[15:53:57] <johnbender> that requires that node be installed
[15:54:07] <uGoMobi> yeah, I havent done that yet
[15:54:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi: we still have the old build scripts available too if you're running *nix
[15:54:31] <johnbender> err
[15:54:34] <johnbender> rather you have a bash prompt
[15:54:36] <uGoMobi> and I can give that command when I am in that branch on Git bash
[15:54:40] <johnbender> works under cigwin too
[15:54:47] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah
[15:54:54] <johnbender> let me check something
[15:55:00] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[15:55:37] <johnbender> uGoMobi: bash builde/bin/init.sh && bash build/bin/js.sh
[15:55:45] <johnbender> but that requires java to be available in the path too
[15:56:01] <uGoMobi> I see
[15:56:17] <uGoMobi> grunt + node.js don't work for 1.1-stable?
[15:56:37] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it should
[15:56:55] <uGoMobi> ok
[15:56:57] <johnbender> double checking
[15:57:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah it's there
[15:57:34] <uGoMobi> ok great
[15:57:59] <uGoMobi> let me copy your instructions, better to do this tomorrow :)
[15:58:18] <uGoMobi> will give tbenzige the unminified version first
[15:58:59] <uGoMobi> thanks for your help johnbender
[15:59:09] <uGoMobi> tbenzige: you still around?
[15:59:45] <johnbender> uGoMobi: let me know if you run into any issues
[16:00:24] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, I will let you know tomorrow how it worked out
