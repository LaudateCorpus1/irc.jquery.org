[09:19:13] <johnbender> uGoMobi: thanks
[09:19:42] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah it is fixed but I still don't understand what went wrong
[09:20:08] <uGoMobi> it is the same as with that Opera fix
[09:32:27] <uGoMobi> it looks like something goes wrong when I do a git hard reset
[09:49:32] <uGoMobi> johnbender: is it correct that I get to see an index page instead of all unit tests starting to run when I go to /tests/unit ?
[09:50:27] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I removed that aggregate test
[09:50:30] <johnbender> it broke way too often
[09:50:38] <toddparker> we have our branding wizard ira working on a jQM logo concept
[09:50:42] <johnbender> toddparker: nice
[09:50:47] <toddparker> looks gooooooood
[09:50:49] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, just checking
[09:50:55] <toddparker> how goes?
[09:51:27] <uGoMobi> hi toddparker
[09:51:39] <uGoMobi> ok, but fighting git :(
[09:52:06] <MauriceG> Hi all
[09:52:19] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[09:52:22] <MauriceG> Hi Jasper
[09:55:07] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: I saw, you made the list numbering and the bottom border style working. Good job!
[09:55:23] <uGoMobi> yeah, thanks! :)
[09:55:47] <uGoMobi> turned out that inset lists with autodividers didn't work as well :(
[09:57:04] <MauriceG> but you made it also!
[09:57:15] <MauriceG> cool!

[09:57:18] <uGoMobi> yup
[09:58:38] <MauriceG> I saw. I dig through the commits sometimes
[09:59:12] <MauriceG> toddparker: I have now 92 commits in my "repo" ...  Hope you will need that
[10:00:38] <uGoMobi> ok, all listview files are now how they were supposed to be
[10:01:05] <uGoMobi> see many new issues today :(
[10:01:27] <MauriceG> you have the weekend now ;-)
[10:04:53] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4693
[10:04:53] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4693 on jquery-mobile (ellemayo; 40m, 17s ago): Checkboxes processing with data-role="none"
[10:05:35] <uGoMobi> does data-role "none" only prevent auto init?
[10:06:03] <uGoMobi> or should it also prevent enhancement when you trigger create?
[10:12:15] <agcolom> Hi!
[10:12:35] <agcolom> toddparker: Can't wait to see that logo!!!! (sounds very exciting!)
[10:26:07] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all! I remember seeing jQuery code that checks the type of a variable and returns it as a string (much like javascript's own "typeof" operator). I don't remember the name of the function though. Does anyone here remember it?
[10:26:21] <johnbender> $.type
[10:26:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Thanks!
[10:30:33] <toddparker> think it should ignore on init and create uGoMobi
[10:31:15] <toddparker> both do enhancement passes, just at different times
[10:33:06] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok, I have to look but I think buttonMarkup only exclude it from the init selector so that doesn't prevent enhancement on create
[10:39:39] <toddparker> i see
[10:44:45] <agcolom> toddparker: I've made the change to 1.7.2 in the docs (master + 1.1-stable)
[11:07:36] <MauriceG> agcolom: Hi Anne!  ;-)
[11:20:58] <agcolom> Hi Maurice :-) (sorry for the delay, I was writing a student reference!)
[11:22:04] <MauriceG> agcolom: Ot's okay. Hope you're well. --  Should the docs not mention 1.7.2 also on that pages?
[11:22:10] <MauriceG> It's*
[11:22:23] <agcolom> did I miss one?
[11:22:26] <toddparker> great agcolom, thanks!
[11:23:01] <toddparker> it's noted on the docs homepage
[11:23:05] <MauriceG> I mean the text in the docs. Did you not just changed the code examples?
[11:23:18] <agcolom> Ah, yes, you are right...
[11:23:48] <MauriceG> and page-anatomy.html -->  jQuery Mobile 1.1 works with both 1.6.4 and 1.7.1  ...
[11:24:22] <agcolom> toddparker: do we keep 1.6.4 and 1.7.1 and add 1.7.2 or do we move to 1.7.2 ?
[11:24:30] <MauriceG> sorry. I don't know, what the changes should be...
[11:24:33] <agcolom> MauriceG: Well spotted! Thank you!
[11:24:51] <MauriceG> You're welcome!
[11:26:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: 1.7.2 replaces 1.7.1
[11:27:24] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, but do we say jQuery Mobile 1.1.1 works with 1.6.4, 1.7.1, and 1.7.2
[11:27:37] <agcolom> or jQuery Mobile 1.1.1 works with 1.7.2?
[11:27:45] <uGoMobi> no, 1.6.4 and 1.7.2
[11:27:51] <agcolom> or 1.6.4 and 1.6.4
[11:27:53] <toddparker> yeah that
[11:28:03] <agcolom> I meant 1.7.2!!!
[11:28:06] <toddparker> 1.6.4 and 1.7.2
[11:28:07] <toddparker> ya
[11:28:14] <agcolom> ok, great, will change now!

[11:28:16] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4689 on jquery-mobile (gabrielschulhof; 6h, 17m ago): popup: Implement position parameters
[11:28:35] <toddparker> that second "expr" is not something we should look at for 1.2
[11:28:52] <toddparker> it's the territory for the position plugin anyway
[11:28:57] <toddparker> no need to reinvent the wheel
[11:29:16] <toddparker> the first bit jibes with what we want to do for 1.2

[11:59:04] <agcolom> it's your finding :-)
[11:59:41] <agcolom> ok, I've added the 2 paragraphs to the checklist!
[11:59:57] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: on win it's okay. on mac no rendering and the overview menu is broken ...
[12:00:13] <uGoMobi> should we add the Download Builder to "Features" page already or wait until final release?
[12:00:40] <MauriceG> agcolom: do you have the opera mobile emulator on your mac?
[12:01:02] <agcolom> MauriceG: euh no sure... let me check...
[12:01:28] <agcolom> not on the mac... I have one of the opera browsers on my iPod Touch.
[12:01:40] <agcolom> Do you want me to check which one?
[12:04:03] <agcolom> I have Opera Mini on my iPod Touch
[12:04:07] <agcolom> MauriceG: ^
[12:05:10] <MauriceG> I just installed on mac (app store) and now I try to make a screen shot :-/
[12:05:28] <MauriceG> cmd shift 3 ...  but where it is ?? :-/
[12:06:25] <agcolom> euh... no idea ;-(
[12:07:21] <agcolom> I use grab for screen shots on the mac

[12:20:01] <MauriceG> agcolom:  cmd shift 4 - space - click the desired window  and search the png ...
[12:20:37] <agcolom> MauriceG: your one is Opera Mobile. All seems fine on Opera Mini.
[12:21:12] <agcolom> but they are 2 separate things. I thought you were after Opera mini!
[12:21:17] <agcolom> sorry!
[12:21:19] <MauriceG> Opera mobile on win does not show this issue
[12:21:39] <agcolom> REally ? That's very strange....
[12:22:03] <agcolom> it's like it doesn't understand read only lists?
[12:22:08] <MauriceG> you can get the emulator in the app store. it' free
[12:22:31] <agcolom> ok, will try... but dinner time is coming...
[12:22:33] <MauriceG> there is missing one list item
[12:22:43] <MauriceG> dinner at ten ?
[12:23:17] <agcolom> 8.23pm only ;-)
[12:23:54] <MauriceG> agcolom: ah sorry ...  enjoy your dinner Anne :-)
[12:24:02] <agcolom> My partner is only just on his way back... Otherwise I would have eaten already! (I've been snacking actually!)
[12:24:32] <agcolom> I can't see anything in the code that could cause this strange behavior!
[12:24:34] <MauriceG> :-)
[12:24:50] <MauriceG> yes, I've also took al look ...
[12:25:23] <MauriceG>  it's weird that the listview is broken ...
[12:26:39] <agcolom> how is it with the other lists in the docs?
[12:27:22] <agcolom> can you try this one: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/index.html
[12:27:27] <agcolom> please ;-)
[12:28:23] <agcolom> this one: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-ul.html
[12:28:43] <agcolom> and this one: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-readonly.html
[12:29:03] <agcolom> MauriceG: I am wondering whether the 1st item being read only is causing this...
[12:35:13] <agcolom> ok, dinner time... have a good evening everyone...
[12:35:27] <MauriceG> thank you!  You too!
[12:36:49] <MauriceG> it's weird... If I switch on this "opera Turbo" mode it works on mac.
[12:37:47] <agcolom> might be worth searching around for Opera Mobile bugs... Have you tried scottjehl bug repo?
[12:39:06] <MauriceG> no, I will take a look. thanks.   If I swtich on the turbo mode on Win, the page does not render ...

[14:48:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [custom select] Forgot to update popup event name from "closed" to "popupafterclose" - Gabriel Schulhof
[14:48:55] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: data-position-to that's an attribute of the popup, right?
[14:49:27] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... rather than of the link, right?

[15:03:54] <johnbender> anyone know what compression level folks use when presenting gzip'd file size numbers?
[15:05:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Presumably gzip's default compression level, which according to the man page is 6 *shrug*
[15:07:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's what I was thinking too
[15:07:44] <johnbender> but just wanted to double check
[15:07:51] <i-hate-dave> Yippie, build fixed!

[15:07:59] <johnbender> yay
[15:09:35] <_|Nix|_> It was my fault - I forgot to update the popup event names in the custom select.

[15:24:02] <toddparker> uGoMobi: this full width collapsible could be cool
[15:24:12] <toddparker> it would look like an expandable list

[15:24:13] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3976 on jquery-mobile (sjdecaires; 3m, 1w ago): data-inset option for Collapsible / Collapsible sets
[15:24:26] <toddparker> heading out all
[15:24:30] * uGoMobi is looking
[15:24:32] <toddparker> have a great weekend
[15:24:42] <uGoMobi> have a nice weekend
[15:24:53] <toddparker> uGoMobi: we should work on demos for that popup positioning too
[15:24:58] <toddparker> i'll give that a look
[15:25:02] <toddparker> if i can
[15:25:06] <toddparker> bye
[15:25:38] <uGoMobi> yeah, I see _|Nix|_ landed the changes, so I will give that a look
[15:25:48] <toddparker> cool
[15:25:55] <toddparker> docs and demos probably need updating
[15:26:20] <uGoMobi> yeah, but he already took care of some I think
[15:26:35] <uGoMobi> anyway... will check it
[15:29:27] <MauriceG> toddparker:  logo. may a bit more motion?  cool idea and cool 3d effect. but looks like a knight mask or a fox with great ears. my first thought was "Motörhead"  never mind.
[15:41:00] <MauriceG> toddparker: with motion i mean something like jQuery gets wings and f
[15:41:09] <MauriceG> flies ...
[15:42:06] <MauriceG> just an idea

[21:18:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added position-to docs, re-vamped popup examples, reduced the use of transitions, removed accordion example - Todd Parker
[21:21:25] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: how do the x,y coordinates work for position-to options?
[21:21:44] <toddmparker_> or is it just origin and window for values?
[21:22:29] <toddmparker_> need some help filling out the docs for popup
[21:22:41] <toddmparker_> make sure options are up to date, data attr, etc
[21:24:08] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_ or uGoMobi - we should probably nix the fade on the overlay for better performance. it's very tile-y on iOS and others
[21:24:33] <toddmparker_> last thing: on the vertical photo, we still need to make this not quite so tall
[21:24:48] <toddmparker_> feels odd that the close button is clopped off
[21:25:06] <toddmparker_> can the height just be 90%

[21:27:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Popup docs - fixed the position-to attribute description - Todd Parker
[21:28:18] <toddmparker_> i'm also seeing fairly frequent cases where i tap a  button, it turns blue and nothing happens.
[21:29:21] <toddmparker_> goodnight!
