[00:46:04] <sven_franck> oh so quiet...
[07:13:51] <Wilto> ’Morning, guys.
[07:17:09] <Wilto> You’re late, bot-t. That’s going on your record.
[07:48:12] <sven_franck> solve one bug, say "hi" to a new one... :-(
[07:54:15] <Wilto> Ours is the fight against entropy, my friend.
[07:59:34] <sven_franck> wilto: :-D
[08:00:20] <sven_franck> or the fight against hydra
[08:01:29] <Wilto> True that.
[08:03:22] <sven_franck> ah... even the cut off head is still smirking..
[08:13:46] <sven_franck> Wilto: to finish this joke off: typo killed the smirk... off to buy some food. for battle.
[08:14:01] <Wilto> Ah hah! Godspeed, sir.
[08:22:01] <_|Nix|_> Hi! How do I bind to the mobileinit event? I have this (http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/tmp.html), but it doesn't seem to work.
[08:22:11] <_|Nix|_> I would like to modify some initSelector values.
[08:23:16] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: This is a channel for the jQuery Mobile development team to collaborate on the project itself—for general support, you’ll want #jquerymobile .
[08:24:31] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I know. I'm working on third party widgets. Also, #jquerymobile is dead. I tried it a couple of times, and I've had no answer for days.
[08:25:02] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: This is the only place where there seems to be some jqm-related real-time activity - the best kind of activity.
[08:28:11] <_|Nix|_> I have now asked there as well.
[08:33:43] <_|Nix|_> Oh ... I need to bind it before jqm is loaded ... hmmm ...
[08:48:28] <kinblas> _|Nix|_: you have to register it before you include jquery.mobile.js
[08:52:52] <kinblas> I think it's described here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[09:41:33] <gseguin> toddmparker_: Collapsibles have a problem in 1.0: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0/docs/content/content-collapsible-set.html
[09:42:26] <gseguin> it's fixed in latest: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-set.html
[09:42:45] <gseguin> I'll try to take a look over the weekend
[09:44:13] <Wilto> Oh, cool. Thanks, gseguin.

[10:30:39] <kinblas> I guess both :-)
[10:32:06] <Wilto> That’s where my money is.
[11:03:41] <eddiemonge> anyone need me for anything? if not, im out for the day

[19:24:52] <eddiemonge> Once you have your own cloned repo on your computer:
[19:24:52] <eddiemonge> make docs
[19:24:52] <eddiemonge> The docs will be built and available in the compiled/demos folder. You can move this folder to your web server or other location. It has no dependencies on anything other than a basic HTML web server.
