[07:08:20] <rwaldron> gseguin sorry, I missed you last night
[07:32:39] <rwaldron> Wilto yt?
[07:32:54] <Wilto> Yo.
[07:32:57] <rwaldron> hey dude
[07:33:17] <rwaldron> Facebook wants Filament and jQuery Mobile core devs to join: www.w3.org/community/coremob/
[07:33:53] <rwaldron> cc toddmparker_ johnbender gseguin
[07:34:03] <Wilto> Woah. And here I thought respimg was the biggest community group.
[07:35:55] <Wilto> …So this is how it works when a group’s chair(s) actually know what they’re doing, huh?
[07:36:00] <Wilto> Just gonna take some notes, here…
[07:36:14] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #600: SUCCESS in 4 min 29 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/600/
[07:45:27] <rwaldron> Wilto one other thing
[07:45:30] <rwaldron> can you do me a favor?
[07:45:37] <rwaldron> can you get me the model number of that kindle?
[07:45:41] <rwaldron> or name
[07:45:43] <rwaldron> or whatever the fuck
[07:45:44] <Wilto> ’Course, man.
[07:45:46] <rwaldron> thanks!
[07:45:47] <Wilto> The Fire?
[07:45:52] <rwaldron> that's probably the one
[07:46:01] <Wilto> The touchscreen one?
[07:46:03] <rwaldron> it calls itself "Todd's Kindle"
[07:46:03] <Wilto> Color?
[07:46:08] <rwaldron> yessir
[07:46:24] <rwaldron> ok, what about the browser in that bad boy?
[07:46:25] <Wilto> Yeah, that’s the Fire. Running a bastardized Kindle-specific version of Android 2.3.
[07:46:29] <rwaldron> ok
[07:46:55] <rwaldron> with default android?
[07:47:20] <rwaldron> or is that "Silk"
[07:53:59] <Wilto> Silk, technically.
[07:54:26] <Wilto> I mean, it’s the Android native browser, pretty much.
[07:57:07] <Wilto> The “Silk” part is just the Opera-esque Cloud™ part, where the workload is split between the client and some nebulous server someplace.

[08:58:41] <gseguin> rwaldron: I just applied for an account
[08:59:41] <rwaldron> sweet
[09:02:49] <gseguin> kinblas: ping
[09:04:24] <kinblas> gseguin: pong
[09:05:25] <gseguin> hey so what did you think about replacing the current .bind by: .delegate( "a, a *",
[09:05:43] <gseguin> to maintain the order of execution
[09:07:37] <gseguin> kinblas: ^
[09:10:47] <kinblas> gseguin: you'd have to do some testing ... if I remember correctly we used to do that, but I think it had some performance problems due to the fact that for every click core had to apply the selector (via sizzle I think) to figure out whether or not it should execute the handler.
[09:11:10] <kinblas> gseguin: you might want to look back in history for that specific line ... I think I put a comment in there as to why I changed it
[09:11:25] <kinblas> I think it also impacted flick scrolling on iOS
[09:11:49] <gseguin> ok
[09:12:05] <kinblas> flick scrolling listviews specifically since most listview items are links
[09:12:19] <gseguin> makes sense
[09:12:36] <gseguin> I don't how else to work around that ordering problem
[09:12:52] <kinblas> gseguin: remove the hack? :-)
[09:13:03] <kinblas> figure out some other way to do that
[09:13:07] <gseguin> that's going to fix that problem
[09:13:19] <gseguin> but not the fact that the execution is out of order
[09:13:28] <kinblas> gseguin: perhaps we should be applying the hack in question on mouseup
[09:13:32] <kinblas> rather than vclick
[09:13:55] <kinblas> I think it just needs a predictable order
[09:14:05] <kinblas> mouseup always comes before click :-)
[09:14:41] <gseguin> rather than click you mean
[09:14:55] <kinblas> gseguin: the hack part that changes the href is in vclick
[09:14:55] <gseguin> that's when we restore the href
[09:15:02] <kinblas> I was saying move that part to mousedown
[09:15:26] <kinblas> oh damn that still won't work will it
[09:15:38] <kinblas> hmmm
[09:16:12] <gseguin> I still think core needs to provide an API to bind with a priority 0 (or something in the like)
[09:17:02] <kinblas> ... or we find some other way to do what the hack is doing
[09:17:18] <kinblas> I strongly believe we should not be mucking with the user's hrefs
[09:17:27] <gseguin> oh I'm with you on that
[09:17:29] <kinblas> for exaclty this reason
[09:18:05] <gseguin> but besides that, the order our event handlers are run differs between 1.6 and 1.7
[09:18:28] <gseguin> and that will bring other issues
[09:20:20] <johnbender> kinblas: gseguin: I have been failing miserably to keep up with this ticket, are you guys posting there so I can catch up
[09:20:28] <johnbender> monkeying with the href scares me
[09:20:29] <johnbender> :(
[09:21:37] <gseguin> johnbender: so basically what happens is that in 1.6 the order of execution for the event handlers was the order they were declared in
[09:21:49] <gseguin> whether they'd be bound or delegated
[09:22:11] <gseguin> in 1.7 delegated event handlers are executed first
[09:22:34] <gseguin> that allows users to stopPropagation
[09:23:18] <gseguin> so the problem in that issue is that we monkey with the href on the anchors
[09:23:39] <gseguin> we set it to "#" on vclick
[09:23:53] <gseguin> and restore it to its original value on click
[09:24:07] <johnbender> wow
[09:24:08] <gseguin> but both event handlers are bound (not delegated)
[09:24:12] <johnbender> that's a huge change in semantics from core :(
[09:24:20] <kinblas> johnbender: uh yeah
[09:24:41] <kinblas> that's something to look out for in event related issues that get filed
[09:24:42] <gseguin> in issue 3686 the user installs a delegated click handler
[09:25:05] <gseguin> at the time the handler gets executed the href is #
[09:25:36] <gseguin> kinblas: did I miss anything?
[09:26:35] * kinblas pats gseguin on the back
[09:26:36] <kinblas> nope
[09:27:32] <gseguin> so the first part of this fix is figuring out how we can get rid of that hack
[09:28:00] <gseguin> the second part is work with the core team so they provide an API to bind with a priority 0
[09:28:14] <gseguin> to get the same behavior as before
[09:28:21] <kinblas> gseguin: johnbender: what I don't like about this new behavior, is that it forces folks to use delegation if they want to ensure something runs before anything bound directly to an element ... delegation is slower due to the fact that it needs to use Sizzle to figure out if the handler should execute at all
[09:30:47] <Wilto> Hey, are the branch previews busted?
[09:31:01] <Wilto> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/ is lookin’ pretty scary.
[09:31:34] <gseguin> yikes
[09:31:59] <Wilto> Speaking of scary: reading through the “bind priority” stuff above.
[09:32:00] <Wilto> Man.
[09:32:13] <johnbender> Wilto: that branches setup is questionable at best
[09:32:14] <johnbender> :(
[09:33:26] <Wilto> Can kick it to make it work in the short term, old-television-style?
[09:35:57] <Wilto> Can we, rather.

[09:39:57] <johnbender> Wilto: I have one other thing I want to checkin in on first then I will
[09:40:09] <Wilto> No rush whatsoever, man.
[09:41:52] <gseguin> kinblas: are you back on jQM? or still busy with Adobe stuff?
[09:42:20] <kinblas> gseguin: Still workin on Adobe stuff ... just chiming in (helping) where/when I can
[09:42:40] <gseguin> heh, help very appreciated
[09:43:21] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: ping
[09:43:37] <DaveMethvin> gseguin: pong
[09:43:56] <gseguin> so regarding that issue we were talking about yesterday
[09:44:14] <gseguin> we have to work on not mess around with the href
[09:44:59] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #595: FAILURE in 4 days 6 hr: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/595/
[09:45:04] <gseguin> but I think we also need core to provide some kind of special bind that would bypass the new ordering (delegate first)
[09:45:17] <johnbender> sigh
[09:45:18] <johnbender> backed up
[09:45:24] <gseguin> you said you were working on something
[09:45:34] <DaveMethvin> yeah i had an idea for something that solved another issue
[09:45:35] <gseguin> for a similar bug
[09:45:43] <DaveMethvin> but i dunno if it applies here
[09:45:55] <DaveMethvin> basically you could define a first-chance handler for an event
[09:46:22] <DaveMethvin> there would be only one for each event type name e.g. "click"
[09:46:35] <DaveMethvin> and it would fire each time the event was delivered to an element
[09:47:28] <DaveMethvin> so as the event bubbled it would fire for each element
[09:48:14] <gseguin> before any other handler for that event, no matter when you declared it, right?
[09:48:19] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: we've got at least one test failure in the suite right now
[09:48:22] <johnbender> collapsible
[09:48:23] <johnbender> looking into it
[09:48:34] * johnbender hates fucking jenkins
[09:48:44] <Wilto> JEEENKINS!
[09:48:58] <DaveMethvin> clearly tho johnbender, jenkins likes fucking you
[09:49:11] <gseguin> :D
[09:49:12] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: facts
[09:49:17] <DaveMethvin> i think i have seen SUCCESS about twice in my life
[09:49:31] <johnbender> our build is pretty consistent
[09:49:34] <DaveMethvin> gseguin: correct, fires before any handler
[09:49:36] <DaveMethvin> it's a hook
[09:49:40] <johnbender> but when jenkins backs up for 4 days it's generally not helpful
[09:50:06] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: so API wise what would it look like?
[09:50:34] <gseguin> I'm hoping for some back-compat here
[09:50:42] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.event.special.vclick = function( event ) { do something };
[09:50:50] <DaveMethvin> oh sorry,
[09:51:00] <DaveMethvin> jQuery.event.special.vclick.before
[09:51:11] <gseguin> ok
[09:51:44] <gseguin> how would you make that work for both 1.6 and 1.7 ?
[09:51:45] <DaveMethvin> the run order of delegated events before was somewhat random so back-compat is hard
[09:52:13] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: random? Or ordered according to when the handler was added?
[09:52:20] <DaveMethvin> before 1.7, all the delegated events on an element ran at the point where the first delegated event was attached
[09:52:26] <gseguin> wasn't it run in the order they were registered?
[09:52:33] <DaveMethvin> nope
[09:52:38] <DaveMethvin> hold on i have a fiddle
[09:52:38] <kinblas> ah depends on when the first delegate was added
[09:52:44] <DaveMethvin> righ
[09:52:45] <DaveMethvin> t
[09:52:47] <kinblas> ew
[09:53:10] <gseguin> brb
[09:53:44] <DaveMethvin> http://jsfiddle.net/dmethvin/X2uSh/2/
[09:53:45] <kinblas> DaveMethvin: so one question I had was when you bind/delegate ... only one handler is ever added as a listener on that element?
[09:53:56] <DaveMethvin> right at the low level, only one handler
[09:53:58] <johnbender> gseguin: let me know when you get back I have a question about the tests you added to collapsibles (according to blame at least)
[09:54:33] <DaveMethvin> so like if you wanted to, you could addEventListener before the first $(document).bind() occurred and out-FIRST us that way
[09:56:09] <kinblas> heh
[09:56:46] <DaveMethvin> or, if you know everyone is going to listen at the document level, listen at the body level and catch it before they see it
[09:57:24] <DaveMethvin> but i really do think the 1.7 way is better because it runs delegated events at a consistent place and makes .stopPropagation() work correctly
[10:01:25] <gseguin> back
[10:02:39] <gseguin> johnbender: back
[10:02:50] <gseguin> are these tests failing?
[10:03:05] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/unit/collapsible/index.html#L147
[10:03:08] <johnbender> yah
[10:03:15] <johnbender> that theme has to be on the page to be inherited
[10:03:47] <gseguin> oh really?
[10:04:10] <johnbender> well let me look at something I might be wrong there
[10:04:21] <johnbender> agh
[10:04:31] <johnbender> why are we doing a closest to find the collapsible set
[10:04:41] <johnbender> ancilary
[10:04:51] <johnbender> *ancillary
[10:04:57] <gseguin> I would expect the collapsible to inherit from the set first
[10:05:07] <gseguin> that would be a question for wilto
[10:05:31] <gseguin> should a collapsible inherit theme from set then page or just from page?
[10:05:31] <Wilto> Sup.
[10:05:45] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: that's why I'm asking
[10:05:51] <Wilto> Set. Then, failing that, page.
[10:05:59] <Wilto> I used “.closest()?”
[10:06:00] <johnbender> getInherited theme inherits from a .ui-body or .ui-bar element
[10:06:04] <Wilto> I hate .closest().
[10:06:15] <Wilto> Oh, I’m an idiot.
[10:06:21] <johnbender> no no
[10:06:25] <johnbender> just need to double check
[10:06:34] <johnbender> I want to make sure I have it right
[10:06:34] <Wilto> Yeah, that should hit the collapsibleset first, for sure.
[10:06:48] <johnbender> kk
[10:07:02] <Wilto> Theme on collapsible overrides a theme on the collapsibleset which overrides a theme on the page.
[10:07:08] <johnbender> Wilto: another thing we should do there is to just pass or assign the collapsible set to the collapsible object
[10:07:23] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: I'll handle it
[10:08:09] <gseguin> thanks Wilto
[10:08:12] <gseguin> thanks johnbender
[10:08:27] <Wilto> Awesome. Thanks, guys!
[10:09:05] <johnbender> that's the only failure though

[10:49:53] <eddiemonge> every comment for 1.1.0 rc1 is " this is really great and i like this feature .... but ......"
[10:50:04] <Wilto> eddiemonge: I avoid the blog comments as much as I can, for that exact reason.
[10:51:56] <gseguin> why do we even allow people to paste code into the blog comments?
[10:52:52] <Wilto> Better still: how do we write a script that listens for code being pasted into the comment textarea and _kicks that person off the internet forever_ in response?

[11:17:02] <Wilto> Y’know what would be a “fun” Friday afternoon activity, for us?
[11:17:47] <Wilto> A couple of folks should start at the oldest end of the bug tracker, and run roughshod over some of the stuff that’s very likely fixed by now. Get the count down, y’know?
[11:20:35] <eddiemonge> i nominate you Wilto
[11:20:47] <Wilto> Yeah, I kinda do too.
[11:20:56] <eddiemonge> and miketaylr can help
[11:21:14] <Wilto> RIGHT AGREED MIKETAYLR WILL DO IT
[11:21:25] <eddiemonge> of course temp01 could fix all the bugs by concentrating on them and magically fixing them

[12:35:42] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3715
[12:35:43] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3715 on jquery-mobile, reported by asamaru7 (11h, 10m ago): fade after Slide page transition
[12:36:32] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #606: SUCCESS in 4 min 47 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/606/
[12:37:06] <DaveMethvin> Wilto: can you NOT SEE that it is hi-tech haiku?
[12:37:23] <Wilto> Oh, I think it’s _awesome_, don’t get me wrong.
[12:37:38] <Wilto> There should really be a “closed: wat” button on GitHub, is all.
[12:37:55] <Wilto> Even translated, it’s like “uh sorry I guess dude.”
[12:38:18] <DaveMethvin> definitely not Google Translate's finest hour
[12:38:53] <Wilto> Again, this is why I think “closed: so’s your face” should be a thing.
[12:39:16] <DaveMethvin> he's prolly referring to the new fade that hides the jump to the top?
[12:48:02] <Wilto> Yeah, that was my best guess.
[12:52:08] <johnbender> Wilto: working on the branches preview now

[13:12:38] <gseguin> There should be a like button on comments on github
[13:32:27] <Wilto> This is why I need to do something with http://drunkcomm.it/
[13:32:46] <Wilto> I think I should make it a place to catalogue the best things ever put on GitHub.
[13:33:33] <Wilto> See also: https://github.com/Wilto/Dynamic-Carousel/issues/51, which I have vowed to keep open until the day I resolve it.
[13:33:34] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #51 on Dynamic-Carousel, reported by marsgoonbars (3m, 2w ago): Enhancement
[13:33:59] <gseguin> yeah I had seed this one
[13:34:11] <Wilto> I love it so much.
[13:34:12] <gseguin> pure awesomeness

[14:53:58] <Wilto> BREAKING NEWS:
[14:55:15] <Wilto> So, iOS/Android’s general up-fuckery when it comes to .focus() on text inputs and whatnot? “.focus()” -> “.focus().setSelectionRange(0, 1);”
