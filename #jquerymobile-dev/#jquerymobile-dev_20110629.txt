[06:56:37] <toddparker> hey guys
[07:02:45] <scottjehl> heyo
[07:02:48] <scottjehl> :)
[07:03:06] <scottjehl> rwaldron_ you rock! thanks, man :)
[07:06:01] <toddparker> rwaldron_ Awesome work, that was crazy fast
[07:06:21] <rwaldron_> no problem, it was my pleasure
[07:06:30] <toddparker> gseguin and kinblas - thanks for being so responsive and getting these reviewed and pulled in
[07:06:36] <rwaldron_> gseguin also helped, so ^5 to him
[07:06:49] <rwaldron_> and kinblas with feedback as well
[07:06:53] <toddparker> any time you want to help out Rick, we'd appreciate it.
[07:07:02] <rwaldron_> cool :)
[07:07:12] <toddparker> looks like there are just a few left to pull in
[07:07:22] <toddparker> at this point, is jslint happy?
[07:07:39] <rwaldron_> i haven't run it yet
[07:07:43] <rwaldron_> i pushed that last patch
[07:07:50] <rwaldron_> and then went afk for a few
[07:08:06] <rwaldron_> let me build this bad boy and see what's what
[07:08:14] <toddparker> cool
[07:09:11] <rwaldron_> you guys should highjack the core's linting stuff
[07:09:28] <rwaldron_> if you wanted to of course
[07:11:33] <rwaldron_> So, there are some logic related things that I don't feel comfortable changing
[07:11:54] <rwaldron_> also, scratch what I said about using the core's linting stuff
[07:12:06] <rwaldron_> i recommend using JSHint
[07:12:19] <rwaldron_> anton's fork turns everything into options
[07:12:29] <rwaldron_> so you can be the "boss"
[07:12:50] <rwaldron_> (sometimes you just know the code is correct and jslint complains)
[07:12:59] <scottjehl> right on
[07:26:02] <scottjehl> Rick this all looks really great. Thanks, again
[07:27:36] <aaronmcadam> wonder what he did
[07:28:38] <scottjehl> code style cleanup across the board :)
[07:28:59] <rwaldron> you're welcome scottjehl
[07:29:05] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[07:29:12] <rwaldron> again, i'm stoked that toddparker let me do it
[07:29:13] <aaronmcadam> it's super important on mobile
[07:29:47] <aaronmcadam> I ran into a lot of bottlenecks on jQTouch projects a few months back
[07:29:50] <rwaldron> aaronmcadam well, I avoided any kind of "refactor" to make this seemless
[07:29:50] <scottjehl> hah. we'd love more of you're help - let us know if you want to work on anything else
[07:29:57] <rwaldron> seam*
[07:30:09] <aaronmcadam> I'd like to see the docs improve
[07:30:16] <scottjehl> us too :)
[07:30:16] <rwaldron> scottjehl well, i'll be in here from now one
[07:30:18] <aaronmcadam> once I get used to the widgets
[07:30:18] <rwaldron> on*
[07:30:25] <rwaldron> do you guys use the github tickets?
[07:30:35] <scottjehl> as in, issues?
[07:30:44] <rwaldron> oh er
[07:30:45] <rwaldron> yeah
[07:30:46] <rwaldron> hahah
[07:30:51] <rwaldron> yes. github issues
[07:30:53] <scottjehl> yep - that's all we use
[07:31:02] <aaronmcadam> scott do u work for filament?
[07:31:07] <scottjehl> sure do
[07:31:10] <aaronmcadam> awesome :D
[07:31:14] <aaronmcadam> I've got the book
[07:31:31] <scottjehl> nice! thanks :)
[07:31:55] <aaronmcadam> no worries, thank /you/ :D
[07:32:23] <scottjehl> as does toddparker, of course (partner)
[07:32:36] <aaronmcadam> very good
[07:33:29] <aaronmcadam> I'm just working with backbone, still trying to figure out how to best use it, but i've had to write very little custom js really so far
[07:33:52] <aaronmcadam> jqm has so much out of the box
[07:33:54] <toddparker> hey-o
[07:34:09] <toddparker> aaroncadam - agree with you on the docs
[07:34:10] <scottjehl> great to hear. we're working hard on it
[07:34:18] <aaronmcadam> actually yeah, you guys would know, is the jQTouch project dead? I know you guys are using it's transitions
[07:34:23] <toddparker> we need help getting the more technical API style docs together
[07:34:31] <aaronmcadam> yeah is there a repo?
[07:34:42] <toddparker> i think it's still maintained by jonathan stark
[07:34:45] <aaronmcadam> I think the introductory notes are very good
[07:34:49] <toddparker> sponsored by sencha
[07:34:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[07:34:58] <aaronmcadam> more sencha touch
[07:35:01] <toddparker> a repo for docs?
[07:35:09] <aaronmcadam> yeah well I dunno how you do it?
[07:35:34] <toddparker> i've been trying to get eddiemonge to pull together a template but we don't have anythign started really
[07:35:52] <aaronmcadam> ah ok
[07:35:55] <toddparker> i'm at the point where i just want to say "let's bang out the docs abd worry about formatting later"
[07:36:01] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:36:16] <toddparker> are you interested in helping?
[07:36:29] <aaronmcadam> yeah as i say once i get used to the widgets
[07:36:41] <toddparker> i can try to get this stuff nailed down so you and others can be productive
[07:36:43] <toddparker> cool
[07:36:56] <aaronmcadam> yeah, do u think a simple cms route might work?
[07:37:01] <toddparker> adam - are you a bocoup guy?
[07:37:12] <aaronmcadam> or just commit markdown files?
[07:37:25] <aaronmcadam> do you mean me?
[07:37:29] <toddparker> i'd actually lean towards github + markdown
[07:37:32] <scottjeh> sorry still here
[07:37:33] <toddparker> yeah, you
[07:37:40] <toddparker> aaron, sorry
[07:37:45] <aaronmcadam> i'm aaron, nope, not as awesome as those guys!
[07:37:51] <toddparker> geez, not finished with my morning coffee
[07:37:52] * rwaldron flattered
[07:37:55] <toddparker> heh
[07:38:00] <aaronmcadam> haha
[07:38:20] <toddparker> if you can forgive me mis-naming you, it would be cool to have help
[07:38:23] <rwaldron> toddparker i've been thinking about your docs issue
[07:38:26] <aaronmcadam> haha no prob
[07:38:27] <toddparker> yeah?
[07:38:29] <rwaldron> and unfortunately, thats a tough one
[07:38:39] <toddparker> bah, i know
[07:38:42] <rwaldron> at first i thought... maybe i can ask the CDOT students if they wanna help
[07:39:00] <rwaldron> and then i remembered that they ALL bailed on me for doing popcorn.js docs
[07:39:06] <rwaldron> and I had to write them myself
[07:39:06] <toddparker> heh
[07:39:15] <toddparker>  nobody wants to write docs, but they all want 'em
[07:39:17] <aaronmcadam> did you guys add the meta tag in the page example on the docs btw?
[07:39:25] <aaronmcadam> had a few people stumped on that
[07:39:27] <toddparker> i will today
[07:39:32] <rwaldron> which brought me to another point... we (as in open source devs) need to make documentation sexy
[07:39:32] <aaronmcadam> it's present in the boilerplate
[07:39:33] <aaronmcadam> cool
[07:39:36] <rwaldron> know what i mean?
[07:39:47] <toddparker> i'm all for sexy docs
[07:39:49] <rwaldron> like, we need to get paul to advocate for docs
[07:39:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah it needs to be super simple to create em
[07:40:08] <rwaldron> people listen to him
[07:40:11] <toddparker> that's why i was thinking about being git based
[07:40:12] <rwaldron> charisma
[07:40:17] <toddparker> you mean paulirish?
[07:40:19] <aaronmcadam> i think docs are the best way for most people to help out
[07:40:20] <rwaldron> yeah
[07:40:25] <rwaldron> toddparker thats a good ieda
[07:40:26] <toddparker> agree
[07:40:27] <rwaldron> idea*
[07:40:27] <aaronmcadam> haha he's a legend
[07:40:32] <rwaldron> actually... a great idea
[07:40:49] <rwaldron> its actually why i made my idiomatic.js project a git repo
[07:41:03] <rwaldron> exploiting github's readme display
[07:41:04] <toddparker> i think if we had a simple html/markdown based template filled out for a widget, people may be able to run with it
[07:41:17] <rwaldron> all changes to the content are on record...
[07:41:20] <toddparker> i can blog/tweet asking for contribution
[07:41:23] <aaronmcadam> yes!
[07:41:34] <rwaldron> i've been using friggin wordpress for popcorn.js
[07:41:37] <toddparker> i just think we'd need a single example page
[07:41:40] <aaronmcadam> that's why I sorta presumed you guys had a repo already
[07:41:49] <toddparker> i use that for the blog and it's sort fo a mixed bag
[07:42:01] <rwaldron> yeah
[07:42:18] <toddparker> is it better to have this be part of the main repo (folder) or a separate repo
[07:42:25] <rwaldron> so, i'm stuck with it... because boaz set it up and he likes how jquery uses it
[07:42:27] * rwaldron barfs
[07:42:30] <aaronmcadam> I'd say separate
[07:42:35] <rwaldron> i'd loooove to use doku
[07:42:42] <rwaldron> or at least try it out
[07:42:47] <scottjehl> easy to make it part of our builds when it's internal (how it is now)
[07:42:55] <scottjehl> ..not that we couldn't otherwise
[07:42:57] <rwaldron> scottjehl toddparker http://wiki.ecmascript.org/doku.php
[07:42:58] <scottjehl> just saying
[07:43:03] <rwaldron> thats doku in the wild
[07:43:08] <toddparker> thanks, was googling doku
[07:43:17] <rwaldron> its specifically meant for documentation building
[07:43:30] <rwaldron> but it's wiki
[07:43:46] <rwaldron> it would _awesome_ to create a git based docs system
[07:43:52] <rwaldron> (who has the time??)
[07:43:55] <toddparker> feels like mediawiki
[07:44:11] <aaronmcadam> Hasn't somebody already done something like that
[07:44:18] <aaronmcadam> am i imagining it haha
[07:45:10] <toddparker> if you find something...
[07:45:22] <rwaldron> so, ben alman wrote gaucho, which is a ruby based cms
[07:45:25] <aaronmcadam> hmmm
[07:45:25] <rwaldron> that uses git
[07:45:34] <rwaldron> but it was his first step into ruby
[07:45:42] <rwaldron> and he admits that it is quite slow
[07:45:48] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:45:54] <rwaldron> ...and it's in ruby
[07:45:59] <aaronmcadam> python?
[07:46:02] <rwaldron> js
[07:46:07] <rwaldron> :)
[07:46:18] <rwaldron> oh... speaking of which...
[07:46:37] <rwaldron> toddparker scottjehl if you're interested, I could drop in a jshint tool to the repo
[07:46:57] <rwaldron> i dunno why i forgot when we were talking about this earlier
[07:47:03] <rwaldron> i get too excited.
[07:47:06] <aaronmcadam> ahh good stuff
[07:47:29] <toddparker> sure
[07:47:30] <rwaldron> bocoup has been working on creating a simple, reusable node+jshint+uglify system
[07:47:41] <rwaldron> if you're interested in test driving
[07:47:42] <aaronmcadam> wow cool!
[07:48:01] <aaronmcadam> always interested in code quality tools
[07:48:09] <rwaldron> but you already have a system and I totally understand that you might not want to change that up
[07:49:40] <toddparker> hey _nickel - you might have thoughts on this stuff
[07:50:04] <rwaldron> Also, i should slow down
[07:50:06] <toddparker> _nickel (John Bender), meet rwaldron and aaronmcadam
[07:50:17] <aaronmcadam> have you guys had any use out of Jasmine?
[07:50:17] <_nickel> hey rwaldron and aaronmcadam
[07:50:18] <rwaldron> I feel like I'm being a little too assuming
[07:50:22] <aaronmcadam> haha hey? :D
[07:50:30] <rwaldron> I shouldnt come in and start asking you to change stuff
[07:50:33] <_nickel> aaronmcadam: we've talked about it but the jquery standard is qunit
[07:50:40] <aaronmcadam> yep :)
[07:50:48] <aaronmcadam> BDD is just interesting is all
[07:50:52] <_nickel> and to be honest I've gone the whole way round with bdd testing frameworks
[07:50:55] <rwaldron> so, dont hesitate to tell me to bug off
[07:50:56] <rwaldron> hahah
[07:51:07] <_nickel> I'm at the less is more stage of my trek to enlightenment
[07:51:13] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[07:51:18] * _nickel is a rubyist
[07:51:19] <aaronmcadam> any testing is good testing
[07:53:12] <aaronmcadam> jenkins is cool though, we've started using it at my place
[07:53:17] <toddparker> so here's one suggestion: we already have docs, but they are more geared towards the "how to use" audience instead of the more traditional dev api-style docs
[07:53:21] <_nickel> aaronmcadam: speaking of which I need to sort out why list element clicks are not closing dialog sized selects in ff on linux
[07:53:28] <aaronmcadam> keep meaning to try running some build processes thru it
[07:53:40] <_nickel> aaronmcadam: our ci build is on hudson
[07:53:47] <aaronmcadam> toddparker, yeah, that frustrated me
[07:53:52] <_nickel> aaronmcadam: and I do mean hudons since I haven't upgraded
[07:53:52] <toddparker> but instead of building separate docs, i think we could just add the api docs to our current docs
[07:53:57] <aaronmcadam> jenkins /is/ hudson
[07:53:59] <_nickel> but I'm working on an improvement for that
[07:54:04] <aaronmcadam> ah righttt
[07:54:15] <_nickel> a testswarmish solution
[07:54:31] <aaronmcadam> yeah toddparker
[07:54:58] <toddparker> have an api section that lets you browse the more technical pages. because you may want to bounce pretty seamless betweent the markup-based config and the scripting side if things
[07:55:01] <aaronmcadam> i think the current docs do a great job of getting you started
[07:55:13] <toddparker> we actually already have a api.html page in each folder, but they are blank
[07:55:13] <scottjehl> particularly now that we made the layout a little more desktop-friendly
[07:55:18] <scottjehl> less to duplicate :)
[07:55:40] <toddparker> yeah, that was a barrier. but now that we have a desktop layout this could work well
[07:56:50] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[07:57:07] <aaronmcadam> I think the plugins need documenting or do the APIs map directly to jQ UI?
[07:57:17] <aaronmcadam> as in I wanted to programmatically show a dialog
[07:58:56] <aaronmcadam> it's drawing the balance isn't it, between a gentle intro and an advanced reference really
[08:03:40] <aaronmcadam> toddparker, are you gonna maybe throw up a blog post on the jqm site about the docs?
[08:11:45] <miketaylr> anyone have an idea why when you close a dialog at http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b1/#/demos/1.0b1/docs/pages/docs-dialogs.html in a non-webkit browser, instead of closing the dialog--it just does history.back()?
[08:12:00] <miketaylr> possibly related to the transitions being webkit only at the moment?
[08:13:38] <miketaylr> e.g., start at google.com go to http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b1/#/demos/1.0b1/docs/pages/docs-dialogs.html, open dialog, close dialog, you're at google.com
[08:14:15] <toddparker> aaronmcadam - sorry, scott and i have been discussing the docs. we're going to try and take a cut at adding an example of the api info into the current docs. if we all lik eit, i can blog and ask toehrs to help us flesh this out
[08:14:33] <toddparker> we use the widget factory from UI so the API is similiar
[08:14:54] <aaronmcadam> awesome todd :)
[08:15:26] <aaronmcadam> I'll pick it up when you guys decide on how we can contribute
[08:15:30] <scottjehl> miketaylr: hmm. I'll take a look now
[08:15:30] <toddparker> cool
[08:15:39] <miketaylr> scottjehl: thanks, i'm looking too
[08:16:06] <scottjehl> in non-webkit, it'd make sense that you're not seeing a transition yet (working on that:) ) but the dialog should have created a history entry when it opened
[08:16:15] <scottjehl> we always close dialogs with history.back()
[08:16:22] <miketaylr> yeah, hashchange is firing in FF and Opera, as far as i can tell
[08:16:37] <kinblas_> what's the issue?
[08:16:42] <scottjehl> in jQM, dialogs are simply pages that are styled a little differently and aren't deep-linkable
[08:16:43] * kinblas_ notes he's late to the party
[08:17:16] <miketaylr> kinblas: in Firefox or Opera, start at google.com go to http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b1/#/demos/1.0b1/docs/pages/docs-dialogs.html, open dialog, close dialog, you're at google.com
[08:17:26] <scottjehl> oh miketaylr: are you pressing browser back button or clicking the dialog close button?
[08:17:32] <miketaylr> clicking close
[08:17:38] <scottjehl> if the former, try this url:
[08:17:43] <miketaylr> either the (x), or the Cancel
[08:17:48] <scottjehl> http://jquerymobile.com/test/#/demos/1.0b1/docs/pages/docs-dialogs.html
[08:18:20] <kinblas> vclick strikes again? :-)
[08:18:31] <scottjehl> this may be the double-back bug we've fixed since beta. Kinblas is about to land an improvement on the fix again as well
[08:18:37] <miketaylr> scottjehl: yeah, that page works as expected
[08:18:55] <scottjehl> ok good. yeah, that's my bad. we'll have that fixed in b2
[08:18:58] <miketaylr> weee
[08:19:00] <miketaylr> thanks guys
[08:19:06] <scottjehl>  test/ is latest btw
[08:19:17] <miketaylr> noted.
[08:19:28] <scottjehl> sure thing! Working on those transitions as well, btw :)
[08:19:31] <kinblas> Just an FYI there is also this potential problem (though unrelated in this case)
[08:19:34] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1821#issuecomment-1463985
[08:20:23] <kinblas> that person used google.com as an example too :-)
[08:20:24] <scottjehl> miketaylr: is pushstate in Opera yet?
[08:20:37] <scottjehl> (just grabbed .next)
[08:21:29] <miketaylr> scottjehl: just landed in Opera 11.50 yesterday
[08:21:37] <scottjehl> that's awesome
[08:21:55] <miketaylr> and Opera Mobile 11.1 will have it, which comes out soooon
[08:22:07] <miketaylr> (perhaps that's off the record)
[08:22:54] <scottjehl> working on getting pushState into jQM. demo url of progress on that http://filamentgroup.com/examples/pushstate/
[08:23:15] <miketaylr> mmm nice
[08:24:30] <scottjehl> oooh! works well in opera.next I see :)
[08:25:03] <miketaylr> i should say, it's also in 11.50 final which was released yesterday
[08:25:11] <miketaylr> rather than 'landed' :P
[08:26:14] <scottjehl> man, this is great
[08:26:32] <scottjehl> Opera seems to have the best border-radius rendering right now too
[08:27:06] <miketaylr> i think there were some tweaks to border radius... pre-11.50 there was some weirdness in jQM buttons. but it's gone now
[08:27:07] <scottjehl> congrats to the team - you guys are doing great work
[08:27:11] <miketaylr> thanks!
[08:33:31] <gseguin> 'morning everyone
[08:34:04] <scottjehl> hey gseguin
[08:34:14] <scottjehl> thanks for the help with all those pulls!
[08:34:23] <gseguin> no problem
[08:35:49] <kinblas> rwaldron: ping
[08:36:06] <rwaldron> kinblas pong
[08:37:19] <rwaldron> kinblas i see a comment on in my email, one sec, reading
[08:37:21] <kinblas> rwaldron: so this sweep, you aren't trying to convert spaces to tabs?
[08:37:28] <kinblas> just curious
[08:37:47] <kinblas> as to what to expect
[08:37:53] <rwaldron> it was already 99% tabs
[08:38:14] <rwaldron> actually... more like 99.9999...%
[08:38:15] <kinblas> yeah I know I was looking at pull 1957 and noticed that most of that stuff was spaces
[08:38:26] <kinblas> or is that just github's diff interpretation?
[08:38:30] <rwaldron> there were two blocks of code that were spaces
[08:38:38] <rwaldron> looking
[08:39:45] <rwaldron> i believe that was infact one the blocks i speak of
[08:40:26] <rwaldron> the code was pushed far to the right and had space indents instead of tabs
[08:40:41] <rwaldron> but only on one big chunk of it
[08:40:56] <kinblas> rwaldron: oh I was just basing my question on how the diff looks for the entire file
[08:41:11] <kinblas> at least in my view,k it looks like indents are 2 spaces
[08:41:41] <rwaldron> across the board, you guys are using tabs
[08:41:42] <kinblas> so I was just curious if that was github's diff display code doing that or if that was indeed the case in the actual file
[08:41:44] <kinblas> ok
[08:42:00] <kinblas> so if you address that one question in 1957
[08:42:00] <kinblas> we can land that one
[08:42:29] <kinblas> let me know if I'm smoking crack on that one question
[08:42:59] <rwaldron> about the string.split()?
[08:43:05] <kinblas> yeah
[08:43:21] <rwaldron> dunzo
[08:43:25] <kinblas> ok thanks
[08:43:40] <rwaldron> that block actually looks like it was taken from events.js
[08:43:42] <rwaldron> in jquery core
[08:44:05] <rwaldron> i can tell because you guys left in the legacy "$.attrFn[ name ] = true;"
[08:44:19] <rwaldron> i didnt remove it... for nostalgia sake
[08:44:21] <rwaldron> :D
[08:44:26] <kinblas> rwaldron: I guess my question is around this
[08:44:42] <kinblas> "foo bar" + "flim flam".split()
[08:44:46] <kinblas> is not the same as
[08:44:56] <kinblas> "foo bar flim flam".split
[08:44:58] <kinblas> "foo bar flim flam".split()
[08:44:59] <rwaldron> WHOOPS
[08:45:10] <rwaldron> wow
[08:45:13] <rwaldron> good eye
[08:45:15] <rwaldron> fucing.
[08:45:18] <rwaldron> fixing*
[08:47:01] <kinblas> rwaldron: sorry network hiccup
[08:47:05] <rwaldron> no problem
[08:47:10] <kinblas> not sure what you saw of what I typed
[08:47:13] <rwaldron> while you were away, i fixed that
[08:47:17] <rwaldron> <rwaldron> fixing*
[08:47:33] <kinblas> ok thanks!
[08:47:56] <rwaldron> all set
[08:49:18] <aaronmcadam> anyway was good talking to you guys scottjehl, toddparker, Looking forward to being able to help out :)
[08:51:31] <kinblas> scottjehl: woah, I didn't realize we were using CSS3 animations for our loading image
[08:52:03] <kinblas> that must be why some folks were saying it impacted precieved loading time on some platforms
[08:58:23] <scottjehl> hmm yeah. maybe we could move to a data uri anigif?
[08:59:03] <toddparker> kinblas - Beta release - cannot run javascript using onclick??  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1887
[08:59:04] <toddparker> what is our response?
[08:59:46] <kinblas> heh
[08:59:58] <kinblas> they need to turn off $.mobile.useFastClick
[09:00:14] <kinblas> these are all the same issues we saw in alpha 4.1
[09:00:26] <scottjehl> which they can't do in beta...
[09:00:29] <kinblas> I meant alpha 4 that we fixed in alpha 4.1
[09:00:33] <scottjehl> they need to grab latest
[09:00:34] <kinblas> scottjehl: lol
[09:01:04] <kinblas> which reminds me ... scottjehl ... did you see my email from lastnight?
[09:01:44] <scottjehl> kin I'm looking at your email now - you're right about the # not causing address bar (at least on a page that's tall)
[09:02:57] <scottjehl> for example, this page has a top margin large enough to kick the link further down http://jsbin.com/idofif/6/edit
[09:03:11] <kinblas> I'm still puzzled as to why the address bar isn't dropping down in jqm ... I can't get it to stop doing that in my simplified test case
[09:03:35] <scottjehl> if you click it on iOS, it'll naturally jump to top. I think that's what I was seeing in my initial test when I *thought* it was causing the address bar to show
[09:03:48] <scottjehl> really it was a jump-to-top
[09:03:52] <kinblas> yeah
[09:03:54] <scottjehl> like I think you said
[09:03:57] <scottjehl> anyway...
[09:04:13] <kinblas> yeah it's funny how the behavior depends on the value of @href
[09:04:16] <scottjehl> so, we can't bind to click and then just preventDefault on touchend?
[09:04:34] <scottjehl> well it kinda makes sense if the addr bar is meant to show that something is loading
[09:04:46] <kinblas> ... well, I think we might. I need to switch the order we register the touchend and vclick handlers in my branch
[09:05:00] <kinblas> so that vclick on touch fires first  before the killing of the touchend event
[09:05:39] <kinblas> as I said in the email, the event is getting cancelled so the vclick special event code just copies that state, and doesn't realize the prevent was done *BEFORE* the vclick was dispatched
[09:05:46] <kinblas> so it goes and kills the real click()
[09:06:14] <scottjehl> ok
[09:06:25] <scottjehl> so we'll watch for your change on that then
[09:06:31] <kinblas> ok
[09:06:47] <scottjehl> I'd like to get some eyes on my pushState branch at some point too
[09:06:55] <kinblas> give me  a few minutes to finish looking over one of rwaldron's patches
[09:07:11] <kinblas> someone was a busy bee lastnight/morning
[09:07:20] <scottjehl> heh yeah!
[09:08:38] <kinblas> rwaldron: ping
[09:09:45] <kinblas> nevermind
[09:37:14] <kinblas> FYI the failure of the select unit tests is real. jQuery core is throwing an elem.cloneNode is not a function error
[10:03:16] <kinblas> gseguin: rwaldron: just an FYI there's a regression from one of the whitespace landings
[10:03:29] <kinblas> it had to do with some $(this) to $this conversions
[10:04:05] <kinblas> Just be careful when doing those types of conversions when crossing scopes. I see where it's at so I'll just fix it.
[10:04:21] <rwaldron>  weird
[10:04:25] <rwaldron> i was running the tests
[10:04:27] <kinblas> it was in the jquery.mobile.page.js changes
[10:04:34] <rwaldron> i'd say just pull it out
[10:04:42] <rwaldron> ok
[10:04:48] <kinblas> nah it's just one of those where the 'this' was actually different
[10:04:49] <rwaldron> i can look now
[10:05:13] <kinblas> it was in _enhanceControls
[10:05:55] <kinblas> there's an each() where $(this) was replaced with $this from the outer scope
[10:06:29] <rwaldron> looking
[10:08:11] <kinblas> rwaldron: it's in the each under the comment "// degrade inputs to avoid poorly implemented
[10:08:22] <rwaldron> already fixed
[10:08:32] <rwaldron> pushing
[10:09:04] <kinblas> thank you sir
[10:09:06] <kinblas> :-)
[10:09:22] <gseguin> sorry I missed that
[10:09:28] <rwaldron> sorry i missed it as well
[10:09:41] <rwaldron> i couldve sworn i ran tests/unit/page
[10:09:44] <rwaldron> for that
[10:09:45] <rwaldron> :\
[10:09:49] <kinblas> uh its easy to miss when dealing with hundreds of changes
[10:09:51] <kinblas> :-)
[10:09:58] <kinblas> the unit tests caught it
[10:10:03] <kinblas> unit/slider/
[10:10:12] <rwaldron> ah!
[10:10:37] <rwaldron> pull request in, hold off for a sec
[10:10:45] <rwaldron> i wanna re-run that slider test
[10:10:50] <kinblas> yeah page is one of those files where you need to run everything because it enhances all controls
[10:11:08] <rwaldron> in that case, let me run all
[10:11:15] <kinblas> heh
[10:11:43] <kinblas> rwaldron: to ease your mind, slider was the only one that the automated unit tests were complaining about ... aside form the select problem _nickel is looking into
[10:12:03] <kinblas> so if unit/slide passes I think we're good
[10:12:10] <rwaldron> i think i'm batting pretty good considering
[10:12:10] <scottjeh> on that topic: what are peoples' thoughts on the auto-init branch?
[10:12:29] <kinblas> scottjehl: I haven't had time to look at what you did
[10:12:34] * kinblas sighs
[10:12:47] <toddparker> well get on it! :p
[10:12:49] <kinblas> not enough hours between now and "toes in the sand" :-P
[10:13:03] <scottjeh> woops, I meant the decoupled-widgets branch
[10:13:03] <toddparker> stop gloating
[10:13:08] <kinblas> lol
[10:13:34] <scottjeh> okay. no problem. it pretty much pulls all references to external plugins out of the page plugin and makes them all self-init on the pagecreate event
[10:14:35] <kinblas> scottjehl: so didn't we have some order dependencies? or was it just page?
[10:14:59] <rwaldron> kinblas gseguin all good
[10:15:14] <scottjeh> I'm still tweaking that a little bit. I think some dependency in order is going to be necessary because of how theming inherits
[10:15:24] <gseguin> great! Thank you very much rwaldron
[10:15:27] <scottjeh> (init the container before the child)
[10:15:33] <kinblas> rwaldron: btw, looking at the changes around that $this change
[10:15:47] <rwaldron>  btw, i like how you have the two test suites side by side
[10:15:48] <kinblas> some variables from the each() scope were pulled out into the parent scope
[10:15:55] <rwaldron> thats super useful
[10:16:28] <kinblas> rwaldron: not sure we want to do that?
[10:16:30] <rwaldron> kinblas one sec
[10:17:53] <rwaldron> type and optType
[10:18:05] <rwaldron> so, basically you could do either
[10:18:24] <rwaldron> declare them once and change the value on each iteration
[10:18:25] <kinblas> yeah, not a biggie, but we probably want to avoid stuff like that inthe future
[10:18:33] <rwaldron> no problem
[10:18:42] <rwaldron> i dont mind reverting
[10:18:45] <rwaldron> if you'd prefer
[10:18:50] <rwaldron> just say the word and I will
[10:19:08] <rwaldron> (as I see it, you guys know best, I'm just janitorial hahaha)
[10:19:34] <kinblas> rwaldron: heh, no, your changes are much appreciated and needed, it makes the code look cleaner/professional
[10:20:02] <kinblas> rwaldron: imo we should keep variables used only in a function, declared in that function
[10:20:48] <rwaldron> dunzo
[10:21:24] <rwaldron> oh snap
[10:21:28] <rwaldron> i need a new branch
[10:21:30] <rwaldron> one sec
[10:25:29] <rwaldron> kinblas PR is in
[10:26:32] <kinblas> rwaldron: thanks!
[10:31:25] <kinblas> great automated unit tests are back to the one error _nickel is looking at
[10:33:32] <_nickel> kinblas: rwaldron so the issue with the tests was due to code I believe I put in previously that was ... bad :/
[10:33:43] <_nickel> timout for select isOpen
[10:34:34] <gseguin> what would you say is the most popular WP7 phone today?
[10:35:15] * _nickel goes off to self flagelate 
[10:35:29] <kinblas> _nickel: yeah we have to get rid of timers and move to notifications. If none exist then we should probably add them.
[10:35:42] <_nickel> kinblas: I'm in full agreement
[10:36:17] <_nickel> in this case the motivation was centralizing the setting of the variable but determinism trumps DRYness here
[10:41:26] <gseguin> toddparker, scottjeh we're looking to get a windows phone and would like to know which one is the most popular one, any advice?
[10:54:05] <_nickel> build is fixed
[10:56:15] <kinblas> scottjehl: toddparker: I found out what exactly is preventing the location bar drop down!!
[10:56:24] <kinblas> it isn't what you think it is ;-)
[10:59:29] <gseguin> Thanks _nickel!
[10:59:53] <_nickel> gseguin: cleaned out my inbox from the hudson emails :D
[11:00:23] <gseguin> heh
[11:00:28] <_nickel> gseguin: hopefully in the next couple of weeks we'll have something much nicer that we can test with phones as well
[11:00:39] <_nickel> gseguin: /test/unit/ is the start :D
[11:01:31] <gseguin> yeah that's cool, although I don't know if I wouldn't rename it to all.php
[11:01:38] <gseguin> to allow for browsing
[11:01:44] <gseguin> what do you think?
[11:02:07] <gseguin> _nickel: ^^^
[11:03:56] <_nickel> gseguin: I had that originally actually and thats not a bad idea, do people generally look at the directory list for information?
[11:04:03] <_nickel> gseguin: I guess I'm not sure what you mean
[11:04:39] <gseguin> _nickel: I do
[11:05:29] <gseguin> _nickel: I like to be able to browse the directory structure with my browser, which is not possible if there is an index.html or .php
[11:05:30] <_nickel> gseguin: cool, noted and I'll change that
[11:05:45] <_nickel> its clearly not pivotal that it be the index :D
[11:07:25] <gseguin> _nickel: thanks
[11:13:07] <toddparker> hudson is back to normal. hooray
[11:13:47] <scottjeh> gseguin: we have an htc surround I think
[11:14:31] <_nickel> toddparker: :D
[11:14:42] <_nickel> toddparker: it was good that I fixed it since it was my fault in the first place
[11:15:04] <_nickel> the fun part was that moving it to the more deterministic pageSequence actually forced the issue in the code
[11:15:22] <_nickel> luckily it wasn't an issue that users would have suffered from
[11:16:35] <gseguin> scottjeh: yeah I saw that on the wiki, I was more seeking a recommendation ;)
[11:34:24] <scottjeh> not sure on a recommendation
[11:34:33] <scottjeh> might be nice to get a different one than we have though
[12:35:03] <toddparker> seems like we're still getting double click issues, even on latest
[12:59:41] <kinblas> toddparker: that's because the latest still processes links on vclick by default
[13:34:07] <scottjeh> how's the event stuff coming, Kin? :)
[14:00:09] <toddparker> right
[14:00:28] <kinblas> I'm writing another long email to you guys :-)
[14:00:30] <kinblas> made some progress
[14:00:34] <kinblas> in figuring stuff out
[14:00:39] <scottjeh> k cool
[14:54:12] <kinblas> scottjeh: I just sent you guys an email
[14:54:30] <kinblas> spent a good part of the day trying to figure out how your changes actually prevented the location-bar from dropping.
[14:56:49] <scottjeh> so you're thinking that binding to click will work if we can execute the callback more quickly?
[14:57:05] <scottjeh> I thought click is too late to preventDefault on external hrefs?
[14:57:43] <kinblas> scottjeh: no no no
[14:57:50] <kinblas> I was merely stating my observations
[14:57:55] <scottjeh> ok
[14:58:03] <scottjeh> yeah... just wondering what we could do about them
[14:58:09] <kinblas> I think we are just getting lucky (due to the mount of work we are doing)
[14:58:23] <kinblas> at first I thought it was just the animation
[14:58:28] <scottjeh> it seems we still need to preventDefault on touchend to hide the thing on external hrefs, right?
[14:58:38] <kinblas> but I placed the showPageLoadingMsg() call on the touchend
[14:58:45] <kinblas> and put everything else back on click
[14:58:45] <scottjeh> didn't we verify that in an isolated demo?
[14:58:48] <kinblas> and that wasn't enough
[14:59:06] <kinblas> apparently what touchend preventDefault does
[14:59:18] <kinblas> is prevent mouse events from dispatching
[14:59:24] <kinblas> but
[14:59:25] <scottjeh> getting lucky as in... "most of the time, the callback logic executes before that timeout so the addr bar stays hidden"?
[14:59:31] <kinblas> you can still bring the location bar down
[14:59:37] <kinblas> if you hold the link down long enough
[15:00:05] <kinblas> no
[15:00:11] <kinblas> getting lucky as in ...
[15:00:20] <kinblas> the amount of work we are doing, and generating for the browser
[15:00:32] <kinblas> is exceeding some time threshold
[15:00:46] <kinblas> that decides whether or not to drop the location bar
[15:00:58] <kinblas> my other point was
[15:01:06] <kinblas> you can get the location bar to *ALWAYS  drop
[15:01:12] <kinblas> if you hold the link down long enough
[15:01:46] <kinblas> even in the case where you've called preventDefault on the touchend event
[15:02:59] <kinblas> I really think we need to restore click ... it's causing too many breakages for folks
[15:04:31] <scottjeh> yeah that's clear
[15:04:56] <kinblas> it also sucks because that damn bar keeps dropping
[15:05:00] <scottjeh> the question is whether we can keep the addr bar hidden at least some of the time
[15:05:07] <scottjeh> with click in place
[15:05:15] <scottjeh> I'm okay with long clicks causing it to appear
[15:05:19] <scottjeh> I've seen that in beta too
[15:06:24] <scottjeh> prevDefault on touchend will catch it some of the time though right? I think I confirmed that in isolation
[15:06:37] <scottjeh> some of the time as in... a normal tap
[15:07:44] <kinblas> prevDefault works because it kills clicks depending on the length of time your tap is
[15:08:42] <kinblas> you see the strange behavior that you see in the fastclick-fixes branch where tapping quickly hilights things, but nothing executes unless you hold down the link
[15:08:58] <kinblas> scottjeh: have you tried my little sample?
[15:09:28] <kinblas> http://webpro.host.adobe.com/people/jblas/research/ios/location-bar.html
[15:11:23] <scottjeh> hmm yeah
[15:11:57] <scottjeh> okay, well beta brought improvements to how the address bar appears, when it does
[15:12:27] <scottjeh> so if it has to start showing again (all the time, or just some of the time), it doesn't affect transition smoothness anymore
[15:14:58] <kinblas> ok so the question is what do you want to do on the HEAD before I leave
[15:15:09] <kinblas> switch back to "click" and rip out $.mobile.useFastClick option?
[15:20:24] <scottjeh> that'd be a start yeah
[15:20:40] <scottjeh> do you see a downside to preventDefault in a separate touchend event?
[15:20:58] <scottjeh> (qualified to not happen in the iPhone sim)
[15:49:52] <scottjeh> kinblas ^^
[15:51:42] <kinblas> scottjehl: Yeah the downside is what you see today on the fastclick-fixes branch
[15:51:51] <kinblas> where things you tap hilight but don't fire
[15:51:56] <kinblas> and if you tap them longer they fire
[15:53:24] <scottjeh> hmm. so in the first case, the touchend is canceling click from firing ?
[15:53:59] <scottjeh> I thought it was just preventing click's default behavior?
[16:05:45] <kinblas> scottjehl: I did too, but more testing on the actual device with my test case shows that it doesn't dispatch the mouse events ... similar to what you see in the emulator
[16:11:09] <scottjeh> okay
[16:11:15] <scottjeh> well, I guess we go back to click
[16:11:22] <scottjeh> without any prevention
[16:37:28] <gseguin> toddparker: I marked https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1990 as a blocker
[16:39:07] <gseguin> kinblas: ping
[17:08:22] <scottjeh> gseguin: yeah seriously - thanks
[17:08:33] <scottjeh> gotta run
[19:47:59] <gseguin> rwaldron: you there?
