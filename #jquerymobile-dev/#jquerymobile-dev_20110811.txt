[08:37:28] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddparker: how are things looking for the meeting today?
[08:37:45] * _nickel is up early after taking his mother to the airport
[08:44:29] <gseguin> morning all
[09:02:12] <_nickel> gseguin: gmornin
[09:02:49] <gseguin> hey _nickel
[09:02:57] <gseguin> did you even sleep?
[09:11:19] <_nickel> gseguin: yes
[09:11:23] <_nickel> quite a lot in fact
[09:11:41] <_nickel> but you really can't know whether I'm telling the truth so it doesn't much matter :D
[09:11:46] * _nickel cackles
[09:12:07] <_nickel> s/:D/>:]/
[09:24:00] <gseguin> :)
[09:27:35] <toddparker> hey all
[09:30:03] <kinblas> toddparker: hey
[09:32:10] <kinblas> toddparker: so can we add the cache stuff to the agenda today?
[09:32:27] <kinblas> toddparker: I've seen several issues fly by about specific scenarios we need to address
[09:40:32] <gseguin> _nickel: did you have time to review that code?
[09:50:42] <_nickel> gseguin: yah I think its an improvement if I read it right
[09:50:59] <_nickel> gseguin: as long as that stuff is well tested I'm always for moving that staircased stuff out to methods
[09:51:07] <_nickel> gseguin: ack
[09:51:14] <_nickel> one thing I just thought of
[09:51:17] <_nickel> should the method be "private"
[09:51:30] <gseguin> well
[09:51:43] <gseguin> but then you call it from an external comp
[09:51:55] <gseguin> so that kind of defeats the purpose
[09:52:08] <_nickel> gseguin: its refreshCorners right?
[09:52:16] <gseguin> yeah
[09:52:18] <kinblas> _nickel: scottjehl: gseguin: Isn't there supposed to be a config item that turns off the ajaxDomCaching removal?
[09:52:23] <_nickel> that sounds "privatish" to me
[09:52:30] <gseguin> the listview.filter needs to call it
[09:52:53] <_nickel> kinblas: altering the prototype for page I thought would do that
[09:52:54] <gseguin> ok, I'll underscore it
[09:53:04] <_nickel> gseguin: thats only my opinion though
[09:53:12] * _nickel doesn't write gospels
[09:53:28] <gseguin> I was wondering the exact same thing actually
[09:53:55] <gseguin> so I'll change that and land it
[09:53:59] <gseguin> thanks _nickel
[09:54:00] <_nickel> gseguin: sick
[09:57:04] <toddparker> kinblas - we sure can discuss the cache stuff
[09:57:20] <toddparker> can you collect a list of links to issues?
[09:57:29] <toddparker> thanks for that fix gseguin
[09:57:41] <gseguin> no problem
[10:00:51] <toddparker> deep-linking to a page in a multi-page setup doesnt work
[10:00:55] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2265
[10:01:06] <toddparker> isn't the answer "yep, known limitation"
[10:01:50] <kinblas> toddparker: IMO we shouldn't be pruning the pages in a multi-page app document
[10:01:57] <kinblas> only ajax loaded pages
[10:02:53] <toddparker> i don't think we do
[10:03:16] <toddparker> this is about deep linking to a page inside a multi-page
[10:15:35] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah you're right, my bad ... it's about us not initializing internal pages early enough
[10:16:49] <toddparker> i've seen that issue, yeah
[10:32:52] <toddparker> i think we have another bug
[10:32:54] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2258#issuecomment-1783815
[10:33:27] <toddparker> basically, if you start on a page, ajax nav to another then go back, it adds a second copy of the first page
[10:33:39] <toddparker> it should just re-use the page, right?
[10:39:20] <_nickel> toddparker: interesting
[10:39:36] <_nickel> toddparker: I think thats related to the relative path changes
[10:39:40] <_nickel> off hand
[10:48:02] <toddparker> interesting
[10:49:50] <_nickel> toddparker: what does he mean "shouldn't be linking back to the page with an anchor"
[10:53:14] <_nickel> toddparker: in the case where he just wants to go back to the home page linking with the anchor/id seems to work fine and prevents reloading the cached page
[10:53:23] * _nickel tested on the demo site
[11:01:48] <kinblas> _nickel: yeah but that's not PE
[11:02:04] <gseguin> toddparker: are we meeting today?
[11:03:37] <toddparker> yep
[11:03:40] <toddparker> starting now
[11:04:30] <scottjehl> hey
[11:47:54] <kinblas> that was a fast meeting
[11:47:56] <kinblas> :-)
[11:48:49] <_nickel> word
[11:49:21] <kinblas> _nickel: toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L1108
[11:49:53] <kinblas> I tried to address that internal page thing before, but ran into problems. Perhaps now is the time to address them.
[11:50:08] <kinblas> that is I tried to address them in the nav re-factor
[11:50:24] <kinblas> instead I put a big-old comment and some code in place that made it work like it originally did
[11:52:50] * _nickel takes note of `.search`
[11:54:12] <_nickel> kinblas: refresh my memory, whats the check for a cached version of a page to be loaded by ajax select on
[11:54:20] <_nickel> terrible sentence
[11:54:39] <_nickel> what selection criteria do we use to find a cached version of a page we've been asked to load via ajax
[11:54:41] <kinblas> uh didn't parse that quite right
[11:54:50] <kinblas> oh
[11:54:55] <kinblas> hang on I'll paste it
[11:55:41] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L597
[11:55:46] <_nickel> kinblas: brb
[11:56:42] <gseguin> _nickel: there will be no underscore
[11:56:50] <gseguin> _nickel: because of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.ui.widget.js#L93
[11:58:00] <kinblas> gseguin: right, in widget functions with underscores can't be accessed via the "bridge"
[11:58:44] <kinblas> where bridge is  $("#foo").mywidget("funcname", arg1, arg2);
[11:58:56] <gseguin> yup
[11:59:06] <kinblas> but you can be slimy and access the actual instance object and call it :-D
[11:59:26] <gseguin> yeah, we were talking earlier with _nickel about renaming that "privatish" refreshCorners function
[11:59:58] <kinblas> you need access to it from a unit test?
[12:00:06] <gseguin> yeah, I don't know if I want to do that though, should I? then people looking at our code think it's ok to do it
[12:00:35] <gseguin> nope that method is in listview and needs to be accessed by listview.filter
[12:01:09] <gseguin> kinblas: this is regarding https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2262
[12:01:26] <kinblas> I forget, listview filter isn't a formal widget is it?
[12:01:36] <kinblas> ... that is, it doesn't derive from listview
[12:02:10] <_nickel> gseguin: thats the idea
[12:02:18] <gseguin> nope
[12:02:28] <_nickel> right?
[12:02:30] <gseguin> _nickel: what?
[12:02:36] <_nickel> I thought we wanted to prevent access
[12:02:46] * kinblas laughs at that last exchange of confusion
[12:02:58] <_nickel> nevermind
[12:03:13] <_nickel> you can access the method on the widget object directly
[12:03:41] <gseguin> yeah but the problem is that listview.filter needs to access it
[12:03:44] <_nickel> $( "#list" ).data( "listview" )._refreshCorners
[12:03:51] * gseguin lost his cursor
[12:04:02] <_nickel> the listview has a reference to the data object already
[12:04:11] * gseguin found his cursor
[12:04:23] <_nickel> err the filter
[12:04:29] <_nickel> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.listview.filter.js#L20
[12:04:42] <gseguin> oh ok
[12:04:45] <gseguin> I see
[12:04:46] <_nickel> so listview._refreshCorners
[12:04:51] <kinblas> right so it can call _ directly
[12:04:53] <_nickel> I believe that will get you waht you want
[12:04:54] <gseguin> let me try that
[12:05:21] <_nickel> Javascript's tagline should be
[12:05:25] <gseguin> thank you
[12:05:45] <_nickel> "if you want to rob, pillage and steal - we won't stop you"
[12:05:55] <_nickel> s/-//
[12:06:17] <kinblas> the listview should really just provide a filter function where you pass it a function and it handles its internals
[12:06:35] <kinblas> the filter.js would then just hand  a function to the listview each time a character is typed
[12:06:48] <kinblas> that way no one is reaching into any one's privates
[12:07:26] <_nickel> lol
[12:07:31] <_nickel> ZING!
[12:07:35] <gseguin> :)
[12:07:38] <kinblas> zip
[12:07:38] <gseguin> that'll be the subject of a refactoring
[12:08:11] <_nickel> anyone have opinions on where the CI server setup code should go?
[12:08:48] <gseguin> as in?
[12:09:35] * kinblas is not sure what _nickel means
[12:11:11] * gseguin is about to merge his own pull request
[13:40:10] <kinblas> rwaldron: regarding that footer bug, I couldn't repro it myself with markup I created. If you get a chance, if you could snapshot your markup and send it to me I can see if I can recreate/debug it locally.
[13:58:40] <toddparker> i go away for a meeting and there's reaching for privates?
[13:58:52] <gseguin> :)
[13:58:53] <toddparker> how can i bad kinblas from this channel
[13:58:56] <toddparker> ban
[13:59:22] <kinblas> heh
[13:59:32] <kinblas> private functions
[13:59:34] <kinblas> :-)
[14:00:01] <scottjehl> http://www.roflcat.com/images/cats/270911970_db35fdd4ca.jpg
[14:01:41] <toddparker> nice
[14:02:08] <toddparker> would anyone be interested in QCon SF this year:  http://qconsf.com/
[14:02:25] <toddparker> they are looking for someone to be on the panel from jQM
[14:02:33] <toddparker> FREE T-SHIRT
[14:04:31] <kinblas> lol
[14:04:40] <kinblas> is that supposed to entice someone already in SF?
[14:05:00] <kinblas> when do you have to give an answer?
[14:07:43] <gseguin> to speak or answer questions?
[14:14:40] <toddparker>  represent jQueryMobile on a panel talking about mobile web frameworks?
[14:14:49] <toddparker> no question mark
[14:14:58] <toddparker> it's a panel
[14:15:02] <toddparker> just field some Q's
[14:15:15] <toddparker> did I mention...FREE T-SHIRT
[14:15:21] <toddparker> probably bottles of water too
[14:15:29] <gseguin> :)
[14:15:38] <toddparker> yeah, if someone out there could do it
[14:17:48] <toddparker> I'm going to cc: you on a message so you can chat offline with the organizer
[14:17:51] <toddparker> that ok?
[14:18:18] <toddparker> i mentioned this here a while ago but email is better
[14:18:41] <toddparker> his name is Simon
[14:19:44] <gseguin> ok
[14:20:41] <gseguin> toddmparker: did you find the twitter handle of that fellow french man who wrote a book on jQuery Mobile?
[14:21:34] * gseguin thinks toddmparker should disconnect ;)
[14:21:49] <gseguin> toddparker: did you find the twitter handle of that fellow french man who wrote a book on jQuery Mobile?
[15:08:11] <gseguin> scottjehl, toddparker: Why do we have a padding at 75px here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/themes/default/jquery.mobile.listview.css#L19
[15:08:31] <gseguin> s/padding/padding-right/
[15:08:55] <scottjehl> ok, it's to accommodate a situation where there's both an arrow and a count bubble, I believe
[15:09:21] <gseguin> hmm ok
[15:09:42] * gseguin tries it out
[15:09:45] <scottjehl> we need a has-count class on the parent to distinguish that situation
[15:09:52] <scottjehl> or whatever
[15:10:15] <gseguin> oh I remember we had that talk before
[15:10:16] <scottjehl> I think we do things like that for other content variations. like when there's a thumbnail
[15:10:17] <gseguin> :)
[15:10:18] <scottjehl> yeah
[15:10:46] <gseguin> alright I'll look at how we do it with thumbnail
[15:10:49] <gseguin> thanks
[15:19:26] <_nickel> kinblas: gseguin: I hope I didn't poach that speaking engagement from you guys ( assuming he wants me )
[15:19:58] <gseguin> nope, no worries
[15:20:02] <kinblas> _nickel: I really love public speaking ... not!
[15:20:16] <gseguin> same here, not my forte
[15:20:25] <_nickel> alright
[15:20:26] <kinblas> I'll pull the strings behind the scenes :-)
[15:20:30] <_nickel> just wanted to make sure
[15:20:31] <gseguin> although I'd like to be able to attend that panel
[15:20:49] * gseguin is going to prepare some tough questions ;)
[15:21:33] <_nickel> "John I took a long look at your select menu refactor and found it wanting, what do you have to say for yourself?"
[15:21:47] * _nickel coughs
[15:21:55] <_nickel> Patches are welcome :D
[15:22:23] <gseguin> :)
[15:28:47] <scottjehl> hey _nickel - is shared actually a file? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/73953915c0e3b409386556e30a42be5585760e04
[15:28:55] <scottjehl> listed in index.php
[15:28:59] <_nickel> agh
[15:29:05] <_nickel> removing
[15:29:32] <kinblas> so  I need to add a couple of test for the new transitions code
[15:29:44] <_nickel> scottjehl: handling that one sec
[15:29:56] <kinblas> should it go in navigation? page? or should I create  a transitions directory?
[15:29:58] <scottjehl> oh no worries. nice work landing that one :)
[15:30:44] <scottjehl> if it went to transitions, could we then turn transitions off in the navigation tests so they can run in under 20 minutes? :)
[15:30:59] <kinblas> heh
[15:31:02] <_nickel> kinblas: I've been trying to keep the tests mapped to files in the js dir
[15:31:19] <_nickel> I take it we can't pull that code out of the nav just yet?
[15:31:26] <kinblas> ah ok .. thanks for the reasoning, makes sense
[15:31:35] <_nickel> easy for new people to find
[15:32:02] <_nickel> nevermind
[15:32:04] <_nickel> we have a transitions file
[15:32:09] <_nickel> I was looking at it last week
[15:32:13] <_nickel> ugh
[15:32:15] <_nickel> yah
[15:32:22] * _nickel is "ughing" at himself
[15:32:46] <kinblas> this mirc client sucks
[15:33:00] <kinblas> disappearing windows bug ... 3rd time today
[15:33:24] <kinblas> _nickel: anyways, you were saying? There's a transitions test file?
[15:33:28] * kinblas pokes around
[15:33:42] <_nickel> kinblas: no there's a transitions lib file
[15:33:50] <_nickel> so definitely create a tests subdir
[15:33:55] * _nickel is for it
[15:34:00] <_nickel> scottjehl: corrected :(
[15:34:47] <kinblas> _nickel: so the CI server ... does it just scan tests/unit/* and run index.html in those dirs?
[15:34:50] <_nickel> scottjehl: correct now!
[15:34:55] <_nickel> kinblas: yes
[15:35:31] <_nickel> kinblas: the new one should probably just use the tests/unit/ test runner
[15:35:38] <_nickel> though that seems to work differently depending on the host :P
[15:36:04] <_nickel> the each() doesn't add the tests in a synchronous manner
[15:36:29] <_nickel> for which I have no explanation
[15:36:35] <_nickel> its on my todo list
[15:36:49] <_nickel> kinblas: that way you can just update the ls.php to add tests
[15:38:20] <_nickel> kinblas: what were the cases where that wouldn't catch some of our tests?
[15:38:54] <kinblas> _nickel: page/base-tests.html
[15:39:17] <kinblas> I needed to create a separate file so we could set up a specific scenario
[15:39:26] <_nickel> kinblas: yah nav is like that
[15:39:26] <scottjehl> oh nice thx
[15:39:45] <scottjehl> hey where did we land with the last scroll stuff?
[15:40:04] <scottjehl> anyone have opinions on how to reimplement?
[15:40:04] <kinblas> _nickel: but my question today was more from the perspective of "if I add a new dir, will the ci server pick it up?"
[15:40:15] <_nickel> kinblas: answer -> yes
[15:40:23] <_nickel> kinblas: as will the test/unit/ runner
[15:40:27] <kinblas> scottjehl: I looked at it, I made a comment on the checkin
[15:40:40] <_nickel> kinblas: you can also add the base-tests to the ls.php if you like
[15:40:41] <kinblas> scottjehl: not sure if you saw it or not
[15:41:01] <kinblas> _nickel: ok
[15:41:11] <scottjehl> oh yeah, right. Thanks. so since we aren't remembering a reference to a real last-clicked element, it's almost always going to focus near the top of the page
[15:41:19] <scottjehl> which is why I called focus first
[15:41:31] <scottjehl> otherwise, scroll gets sent back to top
[15:41:46] <scottjehl> but I understand your concern about focusing out of the rendered view
[15:42:06] <scottjehl> is that still a concern here though? the page is already shown. then we're sending focus to it
[15:42:12] <scottjehl> why would we have to scroll first?
[15:47:06] <kinblas> scottjehl: it depends on what element reFocus() finds on the page
[15:47:41] <scottjehl> so let's assume we always send focus to the page title, or page itself, if that was possible. Would we be safe?
[15:48:18] <kinblas> scottjehl: I think so
[15:48:19] <scottjehl> cause I'm already doubting we'll be able to save focus across templates, and I'm not even sure that's a user expectation anyway
[15:48:52] <scottjehl> sending focus to the page itself is important of course. not sure about remembering focus position from a past visit though
[15:49:19] <kinblas> ok so I guess the key thing here is that we are no longer trying to restore focus
[15:49:23] <kinblas> to the last clicked item
[15:49:46] <scottjehl> well, if we could... it'd be worth considering. I'm just not sure how we would do it
[15:50:19] <scottjehl> we could try and find a unique path to that element through parent and sibling traversal
[15:50:36] <kinblas> scottjehl: true, we can't hang on to an element anymore since we're not caching
[15:50:36] <scottjehl> bottom line, i'm not sure it's a user expectation
[15:51:32] <kinblas> scottjehl: looking at the reFocus() implementation, if there is no title it looks for link buttons and inputs
[15:51:38] <kinblas> that's the part that may cause a problem
[15:51:45] <kinblas> especially if they are below the view fold
[15:52:02] <scottjehl> well, we could always inject something as the first child of the page that can receive focus
[15:52:31] <scottjehl> <a name...
[15:52:47] <kinblas> scottjehl: inject? ew ... but maybe we just fallback to title or page like you said
[15:52:52] * scottjehl ducks beneath tossed shoe
[15:53:05] <kinblas> I think it's wierd to focus a text input immediately
[15:53:10] <kinblas> won't that bring up the keyboard
[15:53:12] <kinblas> ??
[15:53:19] <scottjehl> not on ios at least
[15:53:21] <scottjehl> anyway...
[15:53:22] <scottjehl> agree
[15:54:58] <scottjehl> problem is some platforms (even iOS I think) need a traditionally focusable element for us to send focus to
[15:55:22] <scottjehl> so like... a, button, input, select
[15:55:30] <scottjehl> not a div, h1, etc
[15:55:37] <scottjehl> even if it has a tabindex
[15:56:35] <scottjehl> which is why I brought up the inject thing. anyway, if we agree that maintaining old focal point is unimportant, we're getting somewhere
[15:57:18] <kinblas> scottjehl: so anyways, the focus thing was the *ONLY* thing that concerned me, the rest of the patch is good (as usual)
[15:58:17] <scottjehl> okay (thanks). well the part I didn't feel great about was setting the lastScroll in changePage and retrieving it in transitionPages
[15:59:00] <scottjehl> does transitionPages really need to do all that stuff anyway? Seems like it might just fire the "before" events, call transition, then fire the "show/hide" events
[15:59:25] <scottjehl> then we could key off of those for checking / setting scroll before and after transitions
[15:59:28] <scottjehl> among other things
[15:59:40] * kinblas looks at transitionPages
[15:59:46] <scottjehl> is this the sort of decoupling you guys would want to keep pushing on?
[16:00:58] <kinblas> hey I didn't add all that code :-)
[16:01:43] <kinblas> When I refactored, I thought that all that scrolling stuff was really part of the "transition"
[16:01:46] <kinblas> between the pages
[16:02:12] <kinblas> what I really wanted to do was move that all into the transition plugin
[16:02:40] <kinblas> the only reason I didn't was because I thought most transitions would want you to scrollback to the top
[16:03:03] <kinblas> the other stuff about setting/getting the height etc, I don't know where that came from
[16:04:18] <scottjehl> kinblas: I added a lot of it for sure
[16:04:29] <scottjehl> just asking if there's a better way here
[16:05:11] <gseguin> looks like a broke the bottom corners of inset lists
[16:05:20] <gseguin> s/a/I/
[16:05:49] <gseguin> figuring out what's going on
[16:05:59] <scottjehl> I added the stuff that sets page height because it a) keeps the address bar from pushing the page down when it shows, and b) made the page draws much fuller on iOS during transitions
[16:06:27] <scottjehl> without the heights, a slide would often shown only the top half of the prev page during the transition
[16:07:04] <kinblas> ah ok ... so is that part of "all that stuff" you were talking about in transitionPages()?
[16:07:24] <scottjehl> anyway... maybe all that is fine as it is. my main concern was I wanted to bind to pagebeforehide to grab its scroll position, but that event actually fires after scrolling to 0 :/
[16:07:50] <scottjehl> so I had to add that logic in changePage
[16:07:55] <scottjehl> which felt messy
[16:08:06] <kinblas> scottjehl: oh that we can fix :-)
[16:08:15] <scottjehl> yeah!
[16:08:37] <kinblas> we just move the triggers to the start of the function
[16:08:49] <scottjehl> maybe I'll try and redo it with that change in mind
[16:08:56] <kinblas> ok
[16:09:04] <kinblas> there's an active thread on the forum
[16:09:11] <kinblas> about disabling the scrolling before and after transitions
[16:09:16] <scottjehl> ohhhh... now I remember
[16:09:24] <kinblas> perhaps moving it into a separate plugin like that will allow them to rip t out
[16:09:41] <scottjehl> hmm... disabling before = potential for blank pages
[16:09:54] <kinblas> disabling what?
[16:10:06] <kinblas> oh
[16:10:09] <scottjehl> if you're scrolled down, click a link to a shorter page, and we don't scroll to top, you'll get a blank screen
[16:10:19] <kinblas> oh yeah that, like on Opera Mobile
[16:10:43] <scottjehl> I think ios5 stuff to keep us always at 0,0 is really the only thing we'll want to do for that
[16:11:09] <kinblas> yeah this scrolling is only necessary when we don't have sub-page scrolling
[16:11:33] <scottjehl> well, cool thing is we don't have to change any of the scrolling when we do have subpage scrolling
[16:11:39] <scottjehl> we're already at 0,0
[16:11:56] <kinblas> yeah
[16:12:22] <scottjehl> but. when returning to a page, we're reloading it from the server/cache now, so it's overflow gets killed
[16:12:32] <scottjehl> we have to set the page div's scrollTop to that remembered scroll
[16:12:41] <scottjehl> ideally, before transition starts
[16:12:57] * scottjehl wonders if kinblas knows if that's possible to do on a display:none element
[16:13:35] <kinblas> nope
[16:13:50] <kinblas> it can't calculate the height if it's not visible
[16:13:56] <kinblas> height of the content inside
[16:13:58] <kinblas> that is
[16:14:13] <scottjehl> maybe we can set scrollTop as soon as it gets a class to make it visible
[16:14:17] <scottjehl> but still off-screen
[16:16:43] <kinblas> scottjehl: yeah, you can set the class, get scrollHeight to force a reflow, then set the scroll height (I think)
[16:17:36] <scottjehl> k
[16:21:28] <scottjehl> k I gotta head out but I will give this stuff a try
[16:21:32] <scottjehl> thanks, guys!
[16:22:40] <kinblas> scottjehl: later
