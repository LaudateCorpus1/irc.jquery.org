[09:02:08] <uGoMobi_> hey toddmparker
[09:02:13] <uGoMobi_> thanks
[09:08:58] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi 
[09:09:24] <toddmparker> next week, scott mat and i will be hacking offsite on jQuery Mobile theme stuff so we should loop you in remotely
[09:09:29] <toddmparker> wed/thu
[09:09:49] <toddmparker> really want to dig into that and get some momentum
[09:09:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: ok, great
[09:10:34] <uGoMobi> I was planning on going on with buttonMarkup stuff as from tomorrow
[09:11:47] <uGoMobi> but I could look into transitions/zoom issues first
[09:13:18] <uGoMobi> buttonMarkup and theming are strongly related so it's probably better to discuss with you guys first
[09:23:29] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great
[09:23:39] <toddmparker> we are there to work with you on it
[09:27:21] <asheppard> toddmparker: will next week's theme stuff include the css preprocessing discussion?
[09:27:44] <toddmparker> asheppard: it will be on the radar, yes
[09:28:16] <toddmparker> we have been discussing different ways to make the theming layer up a bit more so you can drop the theme and write your own css
[09:28:40] <toddmparker> asheppard: you worked on the SASS port, right?
[09:29:21] <asheppard> toddmparker: on a sass port, though not a comprehensive one - i focused specifically on custom theming
[09:29:44] <asheppard> since it was what i needed
[09:30:06] <toddmparker> what was your approach there?
[09:30:14] <asheppard> http://wq.io/docs/jquery-mobile-scss-themes
[09:30:32] <asheppard> using compass mixins extensively
[09:30:48] <asheppard> and creating a few of my own
[09:31:02] <toddmparker> ok, so you surfaced our theme comment tokens as variables
[09:31:09] <asheppard> essentially
[09:31:18] <toddmparker> hadn't seen this docs page. cool.
[09:31:52] <asheppard> i coalesced some of the colors so there's fewer variables than in the comments
[09:32:09] <toddmparker> sure, makes sense
[09:32:17] <asheppard> btw the theme comments made me think you might already be using a preprocessor
[09:32:33] <toddmparker> did you find the levers in the CSS were flexible enough or were you writing a lot of overrides?
[09:33:00] <toddmparker> we aren't but it's a similar idea. we wrote a parser in TR
[09:33:15] <asheppard> until i noticed a color discrepancy in one of the default swatches (don't remember offhand which one, sorry)
[09:33:25] <toddmparker> but you could imagine that we could use something like SASS variables and have TR output to those
[09:33:46] <toddmparker> same idea, different syntax
[09:33:57] <toddmparker> and if you wanted to just use SASS directly, you could
[09:34:18] <asheppard> i didn't need overrides, my generated themes worked great with jquery.mobile.structure.css
[09:34:37] <asheppard> i essentially replace jquery.mobile.theme.css with a fully custom one
[09:35:08] <toddmparker> gotcha
[09:35:28] <toddmparker> so this a pretty close to a direct port of TR to SASS
[09:35:40] <asheppard> i suppose so
[09:35:47] <asheppard> an interesting test would be to try to recreate the default themes using this file
[09:37:05] <toddmparker> right
[09:37:22] <asheppard> i think perceptually it would look the same
[09:37:28] <toddmparker> we're going to be making some deeper changes to theming for 1.4, including the default theme
[09:37:43] <toddmparker> but it seems like you could
[09:38:49] <asheppard> https://github.com/wq/wq.app/blob/master/scss/jquery-mobile.scss
[09:38:55] <asheppard> if you weren't already looking at it
[09:39:08] <asheppard> i use compass to handle vendor prefixes etc
[09:41:47] <toddmparker> cool. i gave it a scan earlier. seems pretty straightforward 
[09:42:09] <toddmparker> our debate is is we use a pre-processor then all the bootstrap/less folks will howl
[09:42:27] <toddmparker> if there was one clear winner, it would make this easier
[09:43:27] <asheppard> yes, i've obviously taken sides already
[09:43:29] <asheppard>  compass was probably my biggest reason for going with sass
[09:43:46] <toddmparker> yeah, compass is great. we've been using that
[09:44:05] <asheppard> would the compiled CSS be tracked?
[09:44:12] <toddmparker> if we keep to a smaller feature set, the syntax is not that different
[09:44:13] <toddmparker> https://gist.github.com/chriseppstein/674726
[09:44:21] <asheppard> that would make it easier for devs not wanting to install compass
[09:44:26] <asheppard> sass
[09:44:48] <toddmparker> yeah, if we did this, we'd offer a compiled css like we do now
[09:44:54] <toddmparker> and you could still use TR
[09:45:10] <toddmparker> but if used sass or whatever, you could monkey around there and compile
[09:46:28] <asheppard> would need to check consistency, perhaps as part of the test suite
[09:47:43] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15johnbender pushed 1 new commit to 06transition-handler-refactor: 02http://git.io/uyaVGw
[09:47:43] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06transition-handler-refactor 143edd1c4 15John Bender: refactor z-index toggle to function and callback, test new hideIn method
[09:47:49] <asheppard> so people could submit PRs where they modified the compiled CSS
[09:48:35] <asheppard> and someone would be able to resolve the discrepancy?
[09:52:22] <uGoMobi> johnbender: do you have a moment to take a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5764#issuecomment-15690153 ?
[09:52:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: sure thing
[09:52:45] <uGoMobi> thanks
[09:53:30] <toddmparker> compiled css?
[09:54:17] <toddmparker> if we used a pre-processor the sass file would be the official thing we'd maintain. 
[09:54:43] <toddmparker> if someone forked it and switched it over to another syntax, we'd try to keep tabs on it but it wouldn't be officially supported
[09:54:56] <toddmparker> which is why the flavor we choose is a big decision
[09:55:25] <asheppard> i'm thinking of the case where someone submits a pull request, and they've changed jquery.mobile.theme.css or whatever
[09:55:45] <asheppard> something that's "versioned" but only for convenience
[09:55:53] <asheppard> so you're not supposed to edit it directly
[09:55:57] <asheppard> but they do
[09:56:13] <asheppard> how do you incorporate their change?
[09:56:32] <toddmparker> we'd kick it back
[09:56:35] <asheppard> i suppose just ask them to modify the SCSS or whatever and try again
[09:56:38] <asheppard> i see
[09:56:47] <asheppard> fair enough
[09:57:00] <toddmparker> unless the change to the theme was intentional - fixing a bug that should be applied across the library
[09:57:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hmm is it just a css issue?
[09:57:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm not sure how we can affect placement :(
[09:57:36] <uGoMobi> johnbender: no, it seems to be a navigation issue when it comes to iOS/Chrome
[09:57:43] <johnbender> uGoMobi: orly
[09:58:01] <johnbender> uGoMobi: alright let me write a few more tests and merge this branch
[09:58:05] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'll take a look this afternoon
[09:58:15] <uGoMobi> johnbender: sure, thanks again
[09:58:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: np np
[10:16:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: toddmparker: scottjehl: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.transition.js#L98
[10:16:07] <johnbender> o.O
[10:16:16] <johnbender> ah wait
[10:16:17] <johnbender> nevermind
[10:16:32] <johnbender> the assumption is that the reverse class will have a preceding space
[10:16:35] <johnbender> which it does
[10:16:49] <johnbender> I thought I stumbled on something nasty
[10:16:50] <johnbender> holy moly
[10:16:55] <uGoMobi> :)
[10:33:55] <toddmparker> whew
[10:37:20] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah sorry false alarm
[10:37:25] <johnbender> almost done testing this refactor
[10:37:31] <johnbender> then I'll merge

[10:43:03] <asheppard> toddmparker: presumably part of CSS preprocessor decision is which actual preprocessor script to use
[10:43:13] <asheppard> i use pyScss since i'm using python anyway
[10:43:50] <toddmparker> asheppard: yeah. the syntax is a big one for us
[10:44:03] <toddmparker> scss vs. less
[10:44:04] <asheppard> i mean even assuming SASS
[10:44:11] <asheppard> compile it with ruby or python
[10:44:20] <asheppard> or node?
[10:44:23] <toddmparker> not sure what we'd use
[10:44:37] <toddmparker> we have node already
[10:45:07] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: demo Q for you
[10:45:25] <toddmparker> the search input overlaps the nav button ~768
[10:45:43] <toddmparker> 750 actually
[10:45:55] <asheppard> hmm just found just found https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-compass
[10:46:01] <toddmparker> don't see where we set the width for that. was going to make it narrower
[10:46:17] <asheppard> i was worried that only less had javascript compilers
[10:46:22] <toddmparker> asheppard: yep.
[10:46:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: will take a look
[10:46:48] <toddmparker> we use grunt for a lot now
[10:46:52] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: ok, thanks
[10:47:09] <toddmparker> dunno if something made it bigger post-1.3
[10:47:20] <toddmparker> seems a bit low too, not vertically centered
[10:47:23] <toddmparker> was at 1.3
[10:47:30] <asheppard> i was following a d3-related discussion where grunt vs. make came up
[10:47:43] <asheppard> are they directly comparable?
[10:48:37] <gseguin> asheppard: sort of
[10:49:00] <gseguin> if you're a shell guy like johnbender you'll love Makefile
[10:49:17] <gseguin> if you're a JS guy like the rest of us you'll love grunt
[10:50:53] <asheppard> i guess i'm a perl-turned-python guy, still getting used to the idea of server side javascript though i see it's obvious benefit
[10:51:32] <asheppard> toddmparker: hmm grunt-contrib-compass uses ruby compass internally
[10:51:39] <asheppard> i was hoping it was a pure JS implementation
[10:52:34] <toddmparker> interesting
[10:53:00] <asheppard> i use pyScss so i don't need to install ruby
[10:53:37] <asheppard> nothing against ruby, just trying to keep things simple
[10:54:05] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: wonder if we can make the margins scale a bit nicer in the demos
[10:54:55] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: sure we can add an interediate bp
[10:55:10] <uGoMobi> 7.5% margin left/right instead of 15%
[10:55:28] <toddmparker> been playing around and the 15% seems like too much margin at ~768
[10:55:33] <toddmparker> yeah
[10:55:52] <uGoMobi> will shift the search input a bit up so it's vertical aligned with the menu icon
[10:55:57] <toddmparker> feel like we could get by with less there, but go to more at very wide screens
[10:56:05] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: perfect
[10:56:15] <uGoMobi> I don't see them collapse though
[10:56:20] <toddmparker> no?
[10:56:28] <uGoMobi> you see it on your MBP?
[10:56:52] <toddmparker> yeah. 739px
[10:57:02] <toddmparker> sd or hd screen
[10:57:05] <toddmparker> chrome tho
[10:57:23] <toddmparker> tho switching to 8% margins there will probably fix it anyway
[10:57:39] <uGoMobi> right
[10:58:16] <uGoMobi> collapsing or not... it can certainly use a bit more space
[10:58:24] <toddmparker> yeah, true
[10:58:32] <toddmparker> doesn't need to be as wide for sure
[10:58:47] <toddmparker> i just couldn't find a width anywhere

[12:14:06] <asheppard> toddmparker: apparently there's a C implementation of SASS, with node bindings at https://github.com/andrew/node-sass
[12:15:08] <toddmparker> interesting
[12:15:28] <asheppard> presumably this would be easier to integrate with the existing workflow
[12:15:53] <asheppard> than adding a python or ruby requirement
[12:16:32] <asheppard> though still not pure js like less
[12:22:32] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: didn't know you fixed this - nice. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5764

[12:23:31] <uGoMobi> iOS//Chrome is still an issue
[12:23:52] <uGoMobi> but johnbender is going to help with that  :)
[12:24:02] <toddmparker> cool
[12:24:27] <johnbender> toddmparker: uGoMobi: yah I'm going to take a quick look this afternoon
[12:24:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: is it broken in 1.2?
[12:25:33] <uGoMobi> johnbender: when I first tested all JQM versions were broken on iOS6 but not on iOS5
[12:25:56] <johnbender> uGoMobi: o.O
[12:26:00] <uGoMobi> let me double check now I know Safari and Chrome were actually two different issues
[12:26:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you said it had something to do with nav too, what did you mean
[12:27:00] <uGoMobi> johnbender: disabling hashListening completely resolves the problem
[12:27:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: brutal
[12:27:21] <uGoMobi> and scrolling a bit sometimes fixes it too
[12:27:40] <uGoMobi> so I thought it mist have to do with the scroll logic in navigation.js
[12:27:49] <johnbender> uGoMobi: wait, if hash listening is disabled how is the transition working in 1.2
[12:28:03] <johnbender> shouldn't the page refresh?
[12:28:21] <johnbender> all our setting confuse me sometimes :(
[12:29:08] <uGoMobi> johnbender: just re-tested... iOS 6 / Chrome + JQM 1.2.1 is broken too
[12:29:35] <uGoMobi> didn't test that with hashListening disabled
[12:29:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: kk
[12:31:35] <uGoMobi> johnbender: popstate was broken too on iOS 6 / Chrome, right?
[12:31:47] <johnbender> uGoMobi: holy shit I hope not
[12:32:02] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you mean from the initial popstate?
[12:32:03] <uGoMobi> huh
[12:32:09] <uGoMobi> I thought we disabled that
[12:32:42] <uGoMobi> disabled pushState I mean
[12:35:41] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ok I'm going to finish this test for my refactor branch, merge, and then I'll pester you again
[12:38:19] <uGoMobi> hmm... disabling hashListening doesn't  fix it on JQM 1.2.1
[12:42:03] <uGoMobi> wonder if it has to do with this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5488

[12:43:26] <toddmparker> if any of these are in 1.3-stable and I missed it, tell me and I'll add it to the changelog
[12:43:55] <toddmparker> i had accidentally made a change log from master so i was going thru it for 1.3.1 and spotted these differences
[12:44:24] <johnbender> toddmparker: quick glance suggests that none of it should be

[12:52:20] <johnbender> or the experience
[12:52:30] <johnbender> toddmparker: could be cherry picked for the sake of betterness then though

[12:53:37] <johnbender> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/unit/transitions/transitions_core.js
[12:53:40] <johnbender> unit tests
[12:53:41] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[12:53:44] <johnbender> the glory
[12:54:11] <johnbender> I didn't bother renaming the methods
[12:54:17] <johnbender> if we ever make that public we can talk about the method names
[12:55:07] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm going to grab some food and take a piss, when I get back I'll take a look at the transitions
[12:55:22] <gseguin> johnbender: what's that?
[12:55:24] <toddmparker> johnbender: woo hoo. congrats.
[12:55:38] <toddmparker> now go pee.
[12:55:40] <uGoMobi> johnbender: great
[12:55:46] <johnbender> gseguin: I merged the transitions refactor
[12:55:46] <gseguin> oh 
[12:55:53] <gseguin> great!
[12:55:55] <johnbender> toddmparker: uGoMobi: also keep an eye out for any weirdness
[12:56:30] <uGoMobi> I always keep an eye out for weirdness o_O
[12:57:05] <toddmparker> it's all i see here
[12:57:20] <toddmparker> once we hit rod, i'llpost up the 1.3.1 change log for review
[12:57:42] <uGoMobi> :)
[12:57:55] <toddmparker> eod, not rod
[12:58:06] <toddmparker> auto-correct is wacked
[12:58:18] <uGoMobi> weirdness
[13:00:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: from those 4 commits you posted above I think we can/should cherry-pick the top two only
[13:00:51] <uGoMobi> 3rd is about making popup work outside a page
[13:01:49] <uGoMobi> the 4th about clear btn on IE10 needs some attention first (see comment in the commit)
[13:05:10] <uGoMobi> oh, I am wrong about the 3rd... it's probably not about working outside a page :/
[13:06:54] <toddmparker> just wanted eyes on 'em
[13:07:00] <toddmparker> in case any should be picked
[13:07:06] <toddmparker> those were just samples
[13:08:13] <uGoMobi> I understand
[13:08:29] <uGoMobi> will check them with johnbender when he is back and cherry-pick

[13:30:51] <uGoMobi> johnbender: the iOS/chrome transition issue?
[13:31:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yessir
[13:31:07] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5764
[13:31:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: sorry
[13:45:12] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it looks like I'll need to use the simulator to see this huh?
[13:45:55] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I guess on browserstack you can't use Chrome
[13:46:17] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I have chrome on my desktop, do you mean chrome in iOS6?
[13:46:30] <uGoMobi> yeah, sorry, chrome on iOS6
[13:46:35] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ok so a webview
[13:46:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: alright I'll break out the emulator
[13:47:25] <johnbender> uGoMobi: there might be an update/install in my future :(
[13:51:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi: having some issues with my Mac, it might have to wait until tomorrow
[13:52:03] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, np
[13:53:31] <uGoMobi> johnbender: other Q - do you think we need to cherry pick this one into 1.3-stable? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a8bc1c34ffc8ca9839d8f3fbb599066da20547f7
[13:54:05] <uGoMobi> I am not sure what "Make it work when built on its own" is about
[13:54:16] <johnbender> toddmparker: I don't think so
[13:54:21] <johnbender> toddmparker: wrong person
[13:54:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I don't think so
[13:54:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I think that's only for the standalone popup
[13:54:34] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[13:54:36] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I would ask _|Nix|_ though if you can find him
[13:54:44] <uGoMobi> thought so too
[13:55:10] <uGoMobi> I think _|Nix|_ is on vacation

[15:10:45] <toddmparker> nice

[15:11:05] <uGoMobi> the others don't need to be picked
[15:11:21] <uGoMobi> johnbender: can you take a look at that commit?

[15:11:46] <uGoMobi> yeah
[15:12:33] <uGoMobi> ok I'll cherry-pick that one and run the test local
[15:16:28] <uGoMobi> hmm... bunch of merge conflicts
[15:16:39] <uGoMobi> seems like we can't pick that commit on its own
[15:22:46] <uGoMobi> requires this one to be cherry-picked as well https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/ee30a7352ede160935e6b8c5815bf4adee3070d7
[15:24:55] <uGoMobi> nevermind... that is one is cherry-picked but the conflict is because the one I try to pick is older
[15:25:02] <johnbender> uGoMobi: toddmparker: if were not sure we can release without it and do another later when we can check with _|Nix|_ 
[15:29:07] <toddmparker> agreed
[15:29:15] <toddmparker> there will be a 1.3.2
[15:29:32] <toddmparker> so it's better to play it safe
[15:30:21] <uGoMobi> I resolved the conflicts
