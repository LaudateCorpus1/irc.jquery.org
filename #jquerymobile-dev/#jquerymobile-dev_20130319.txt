[06:17:13] <frequent> uGoMobi: afternoon-ping
[06:17:46] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[06:18:49] <frequent> do you know if it's possible to use a single popup with multiple popup-buttons?
[06:19:30] <uGoMobi> you mean multiple links pointing to same popup? yeah, should possible
[06:19:54] <frequent> ok. I'm breaking pages with creating popups in each table row
[06:20:14] <frequent> Unit test for refresh I will probably finish tonight.

[08:01:49] <toddmparker> morning
[08:02:09] <toddmparker> i  have a meeting until 3 today but can look at releasing 1.1.2 then
[08:02:33] <toddmparker> maybe we can be at the ready for TR and download builder too
[08:03:53] <kayo> what is the difference from jquery.mobile.1.3.0 and jquery.mobile.structure.1.3.0?
[08:14:53] <uGoMobi> TR and DB are ready
[08:15:47] <uGoMobi> looked into the 1.1.2 + core 1.7.2 bug
[08:16:03] <uGoMobi> I think it's more a matter of updating the test
[08:16:13] <uGoMobi> will discuss with gseguin|away johnbender 
[08:41:07] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: cool
[08:41:17] <toddmparker> thanks for getting that stuff ready too

[09:19:06] <gseguin> mornin' all
[09:33:55] <johnbender> gseguin: yo!
[09:34:05] <gseguin> hey Bender
[09:34:24] <gseguin> did you see the failing test on 1.1-stable with jQuery 1.7.2 ?
[09:34:31] <johnbender> no
[09:34:42] <johnbender> gseguin: let me take a look
[09:35:06] <gseguin> uGoMobi thinks it could be just a matter of updating the test
[09:35:14] <gseguin> I haven't looked at it
[09:35:53] <uGoMobi> gseguin: johnbender : see this commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7c7efdcc6553058a77a8b25f3b1e3e72524f57c0
[09:36:22] <johnbender> gseguin: uGoMobi: I'm still trying to find the failure in travis :)
[09:36:37] <gseguin> heh :)
[09:37:55] <uGoMobi> I think I was wrong about just updating the test... I think it's more like we have to cherry-pick that commit into 1.1-stable :)
[09:38:37] <johnbender> gseguin: uGoMobi: where's the failing test in travis
[09:38:40] <uGoMobi> thought it was already in 1.1-stable, but it isn't
[09:38:41] <johnbender> I can't find it for the life of me
[09:38:48] <uGoMobi> http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%201.1-stable/277/console
[09:39:06] <johnbender> oh
[09:39:08] <gseguin> johnbender: it's not in Travis
[09:39:10] <johnbender> lol
[09:39:13] <gseguin> it's on 1.1-stable
[09:39:59] <johnbender> uGoMobi: have you tried cherry picking that commit?
[09:40:52] <uGoMobi> johnbender: no, not yet... thought it was already in but was looking at 1.2-stable branch :/
[09:40:59] <uGoMobi> will do that now
[09:41:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: cool!
[09:48:30] <johnbender> gseguin: looking at the failures
[09:48:50] <gseguin> johnbender: getting off the bus, will be back online in a few 
[09:48:54] <johnbender> gseguin: they look lik they're predominantly failures with travis itself
[09:49:23] <uGoMobi> err... it was already in 1.1 (sorry for the confusion)
[09:51:35] <uGoMobi> got it
[09:51:51] <uGoMobi> johnbender: this was the missing commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/11ad07dd81ecdba608c32e8831300baf60f35776
[09:52:10] <uGoMobi> cherry-picked and tests are ok now

[10:06:55] <johnbender> just go all in on travis
[10:07:56] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah, think we can remove 1.1- and 1.2 stable from both Jenkins and Travis as soon as we released 1.1.2 and 1.2.1
[10:08:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ah that's right

[10:29:43] <uGoMobi> johnbender: did we really degrade IE7 to B-grade? thought we only added a warning
[10:30:12] <johnbender> uGoMobi: dunno, I thought we just left it where it was because it had always been that way
[10:30:19] <johnbender> and no one was complaining o.o
[10:32:51] <uGoMobi> yeah, thought so too
[10:33:22] <uGoMobi> here we say it's B-grade though... http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/
[10:36:36] <uGoMobi> which is wrong
[10:36:38] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.support.js#L237
[10:38:55] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: updated 1.1 / 1.2 supported platform pages (left out IE10 and BB10)
[10:42:53] <mspisars> i think 7 year old browsers should not be even considered for A-grade :)

[11:16:18] <uGoMobi> tested against core 1.6.4, 1.7.1 and 1.7.2 ... all good :)
[11:16:27] <JasonDScott> Does anyone know a mobile device that has a virtual keyboard that takes up more than half the screen height?
[11:17:45] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: my Android 2.3 device does that in landscape mode
[11:18:36] <JasonDScott> but Not in portrait tho?
[11:18:44] <uGoMobi> nope
[11:18:44] <JasonDScott> On our Z10 in portrait mode - if the keyboard is up the landscape media query is true.
[11:18:52] <JasonDScott> I think it's weird
[11:19:04] <JasonDScott> and could break layouts 
[11:19:05] <uGoMobi> :(
[11:19:11] <JasonDScott> what are your thoughts
[11:19:11] <uGoMobi> for sure
[11:20:10] <JasonDScott> the justification is that the viewable dimensions are landscape (width > height)
[11:20:15] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: do you use width=device-width and min-width in the MQ?
[11:20:47] <JasonDScott> I was only using landscape
[11:21:20] <JasonDScott> orientation: landscape
[11:21:23] <uGoMobi> ah right, of course
[11:21:45] <uGoMobi> but width=device-width in the viewport meta tag?
[11:22:10] <JasonDScott> Noâ€¦ But I don't think it will matterâ€¦ I can check
[11:26:48] <JasonDScott> Ya, same thing
[11:26:51] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: width and height are used to establish orientation so I thought setting width=device-width might make a difference... not sure though
[11:26:56] <uGoMobi> I see
[11:26:58] <uGoMobi> hmm
[11:30:27] <JasonDScott> Would you expect the min-height to change when the VKB is up?
[11:31:01] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15itzikv opened issue #5788: link doesn't work at Android 4.x  02http://git.io/Xd6G8w
[11:31:07] <JasonDScott> or the height that is used to calculate the min-height
[11:35:22] <uGoMobi> no
[11:43:11] <JasonDScott> ok
[12:15:00] <agcolom> good evening, anyone still around? 
[12:15:11] <agcolom> I need your guidance regarding https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/106
[12:19:01] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi Jasper, are the event names incorrect? 
[12:19:03] <agcolom> ^
[12:32:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne
[12:32:25] <agcolom> johnbender: gseguin hi! I just saw this one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5188 
[12:32:46] <agcolom> is that not what you've been doing recentently?
[12:33:05] <agcolom> hi Jasper :-)
[12:33:12] <uGoMobi> agcolom: with collapsiblecreate it's same as with other widgets.... type is "collapsiblecreate" but you bind to "create"
[12:33:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I am not sure about expand and collapse
[12:34:16] <agcolom> ok,thanks...
[12:34:42] <agcolom> will be abck after dinner...
[12:36:34] <uGoMobi> I think expand and collapse events are bit different case
[12:44:38] <johnbender> agcolom: you can close that one :)
[12:44:58] <johnbender> agcolom: closed
[12:56:29] <agcolom> uGoMobi: so does that mean that all widgets are wrong for create?
[12:56:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: no, they are correct
[12:57:06] <uGoMobi> and so is "collapsiblecreate"
[12:57:40] <agcolom> ok... so is that issue not an issue then?
[12:57:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: see popup widget for example
[12:58:43] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the 2 other collapsible events ("expand" and "collapse") might be a different case
[12:58:55] <uGoMobi> I have to check
[12:58:57] <agcolom> popup says: Bind an event listener to the popupcreate event:
[12:59:09] <agcolom> $( ".selector" ).on( "popupcreate", function( event, ui ) {} );
[12:59:25] <agcolom> because all this is generated automatically...
[13:00:31] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:01:10] <uGoMobi> that is correct
[13:01:27] <uGoMobi> and same goes for collapsiblecreate
[13:01:46] <agcolom> so I am not seing what is wrong with collapsiblecreate... 
[13:01:55] <agcolom> (maybe I'm just too tired ;-) )
[13:02:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: nothing is wrong with collapsiblecreate
[13:02:40] <agcolom> ok... so is the issue that is mentioned not an issue then?
[13:02:42] <uGoMobi> but that issue ticket is also about collapsibleexpand and collapsiblecollapse
[13:02:53] <agcolom> yes
[13:02:56] <uGoMobi> and those two might be wrong
[13:03:01] <agcolom> ah ok
[13:03:29] <uGoMobi> because they are an exception
[13:03:43] <agcolom> ok
[13:04:11] <uGoMobi> but I have to check the widget factory and the collapsible widget code to be sure
[13:04:31] <agcolom> sure... thanks a lot. no rush... when you have time :-)
[13:04:49] <uGoMobi> will give that a look tomorrow and let you know, ok?
[13:04:57] <agcolom> johnbender: thanks :-)
[13:05:17] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, that's great! Thanks!
[13:09:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5784
[13:15:36] <toddmparker> hi all 
[13:15:44] <agcolom> hi toddmparker 
[13:15:49] <toddmparker> hi agcolom
[13:17:45] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and johnbender - looks like you fixed that failing test in 1.1-stable
[13:17:56] <toddmparker> so i think we're ready to tag this sucker
[13:17:58] <johnbender> toddmparker: uGoMobi did
[13:18:04] <johnbender> toddmparker: cool
[13:18:13] <uGoMobi> yeah lets do this
[13:18:36] <toddmparker> cool
[13:18:45] <toddmparker> i don't think gseguin is here
[13:19:15] <toddmparker> he did the test deploy tho so i think we're all set if johnbender meets a speeding bus :p
[13:19:37] <agcolom> re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5119 should we ask if it's still an issue and if it is ask for a test page?
[13:19:46] <johnbender> toddmparker: yah
[13:19:50] <toddmparker> johnbender: let's tag this and have a beer
[13:19:59] <toddmparker> i'll get the site ready to annouce
[13:20:00] <johnbender> toddmparker: ok, I assume you mean both then/
[13:20:04] <johnbender> ?
[13:20:14] <toddmparker> just 1.1.2
[13:20:34] <toddmparker> i want to wait a few days for 1.2.1, mainly to avoid any confusion
[13:20:41] <toddmparker> blog post is written on that too
[13:20:48] <toddmparker> so we're really ready to go
[13:21:08] <toddmparker> tho i guess we could do both at once
[13:21:14] <toddmparker> numbers seemed so damn close
[13:21:14] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:21:32] <uGoMobi> might be less confusing
[13:21:43] <toddmparker> yeah
[13:21:48] <toddmparker> ok, i'll work on 1.1.2
[13:21:57] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: thanks for updating the supported browsers
[13:22:01] <johnbender> toddmparker: got it
[13:22:05] <uGoMobi> if I would almost same post in a few days I wouldn't reognize the diff version number
[13:22:16] <uGoMobi> would see *
[13:22:31] <uGoMobi> you know what ... I better don't try to type :)
[13:23:16] <toddmparker> good idea 
[13:25:58] <johnbender> toddmparker: deployed
[13:26:07] <johnbender> toddmparker: just need to tag when you're happy
[13:26:11] <toddmparker> ok, i'm ready on the siteâ€¦i'll confirm the links work
[13:26:31] <toddmparker> johnbender: i'm happy, tag it!
[13:26:43] <johnbender> cool
[13:26:46] <toddmparker> while i check links and such

[13:30:05] <toddmparker> just waiting for http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.1.2/ to work and I'll announce
[13:30:20] <toddmparker> 65 fixes in this releaseâ€¦not to shabby
[13:30:31] <toddmparker> course it's months of stuff
[13:30:51] <toddmparker> so maybe we do 1.2.1 on thursday?
[13:31:09] <toddmparker> thinking we should do 1.3.1 soon too -- next week?
[13:31:21] <toddmparker> there are a few annoying bugs we've fixed
[13:32:05] <toddmparker> uGoMobi or johnbender - any idea why the version flag says "dev"
[13:32:10] <toddmparker> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.1.2/
[13:32:40] <toddmparker> that ain't right
[13:32:42] <uGoMobi> johnbender: is that ^^ resolved after tagging?
[13:32:58] <toddmparker> we're tagged
[13:33:05] <uGoMobi> ohw
[13:33:15] <toddmparker> that preview wouldn't work unless we were tagged :)
[13:33:37] <uGoMobi> right
[13:33:43] <uGoMobi> pff
[13:33:45] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:33:53] <toddmparker> stupid version flag
[13:33:58] <agcolom> re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4893 Looks fixed
[13:34:09] <agcolom> can someone please double check? 
[13:34:48] <agcolom> once the page is opened, opening the popup does not seem to generate a pagechange event.
[13:35:17] <agcolom> test page is http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/7AbbK/ )
[13:36:20] <toddmparker> agcolom: that test page seems to work right, no change page event being logged for the popup button
[13:36:32] <agcolom> great. so I'm closing :-)
[13:36:48] <johnbender> toddmparker: no idea
[13:37:14] <johnbender> toddmparker: well wasn't it hardcoded priort to like 1.2?
[13:37:26] <johnbender> toddmparker: I can just go in an alter it 
[13:37:37] <uGoMobi> let's hardcode it now :)
[13:37:40] <toddmparker> sure
[13:37:49] <toddmparker> we gotta be fancy here
[13:38:00] <toddmparker> with all our javascripts and dhtml
[13:39:21] <johnbender> shit
[13:39:24] <johnbender> it isn't hardcoded
[13:41:56] <johnbender> toddmparker: I think that has to do with the fact that we moved to the view server
[13:42:02] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'm just going to add it in manually
[13:42:44] <toddmparker> pooh, right
[13:42:55] <toddmparker> i'll update 1.2-stable
[13:43:39] <johnbender> toddmparker: done
[13:44:32] <rdavidwu> hi toddmparker
[13:44:47] <toddmparker> thanks johnbender 
[13:45:06] <toddmparker> confirmed
[13:45:28] <toddmparker> did you just paste in the text or did you have to disable the js that updates that string too?

[13:46:10] <toddmparker> i did earlier and added a comment

[13:46:38] <rdavidwu> yea i did
[13:46:54] <toddmparker> yeeps. you have a link to the PR handy?
[13:48:03] <rdavidwu> yes, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5770
[13:49:34] <toddmparker> 1.1.2 is a GO - http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2013/03/19/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-1-2/
[13:52:19] <toddmparker> rdavidwu: nice. works perfectly on my iPhone 
[13:52:32] <toddmparker> what devices have you tested this on?
[13:53:25] <rdavidwu> blackberry z10 and iphone 4
[13:54:11] <rdavidwu> on the galaxy s3, chrome works fine
[13:54:21] <toddmparker> ok, i can look on some other devices
[13:54:58] <rdavidwu> ok
[13:55:02] <toddmparker> one thing I noticed - if you open the original index, the last button on top "open top list view" seems to use the height of the other, shorter, panel
[13:55:31] <toddmparker> good test page - we need to cope with variable height panels on one page
[13:55:44] <toddmparker> but this works really well. impressive
[13:56:05] <agcolom> toddmparker: is it new that disqus adds 'ads' links at the botton of the blog post? (I've never noticed this before)
[13:57:11] <agcolom> yes, just checked 1.3.0 announcement, and there's something there as well.. so I guess this is not new... 
[13:57:12] <rdavidwu> thanks
[13:57:22] <rdavidwu> yes it has the same height
[13:57:45] <toddmparker> agcolom: hem, dunno. probably new
[13:57:54] <toddmparker> we're going to drop all that very soon with the new site
[13:58:23] <toddmparker> rdavidwu: so can the plugin get the height of each panel
[13:58:29] <agcolom> ok... seems strange to get some unrelated ads at the end of the post... 
[13:59:41] <agcolom> this one had a milestone for 1.1.2: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4826
[14:00:04] <rdavidwu> toddmparker: sorry, what do you mean by get the height?
[14:01:19] <toddmparker> if you have a 2 top panels, each with different heights (a menu and login form), we should handle that
[14:01:32] <toddmparker> seems like you use the same height for all top panels?
[14:02:12] <rdavidwu> yea right now all top panels have a set height in css
[14:03:44] <rdavidwu> so your suggestion would be to make the panel height change depending on the content?
[14:04:03] <toddmparker> ideally
[14:04:34] <toddmparker> how did you change the css between these two demos?
[14:05:02] <toddmparker> just trying to understand how things worl
[14:05:09] <rdavidwu> i just did it manually 
[14:05:35] <rdavidwu> by changing the values of the css file
[14:06:11] <rdavidwu> the height is basically "hardcoded" right now
[14:07:18] <uGoMobi> 1.1.2 has been added to the TR
[14:08:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: He's proposing we do not execute $.widget unless there are widgets of that type in the page.
[14:08:05] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: nice
[14:08:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: what do you mean "execute $.widget"
[14:09:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We do not run the following: $.widget ( "mobile.somewidget", $.mobile.widget, {} ) during library load at all.
[14:09:17] <toddmparker> rdavidwu: would it be possible to look at making the top panel support various heights automatically?
[14:09:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We run it during pagecreate, but only if widgets of that type can be found in the page.
[14:09:32] <toddmparker> hard for us to pick a height that will work for everyone
[14:09:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I mean, why would you define a slider, when your first page only contains a couple of blurbs and a link?
[14:09:56] <toddmparker> we sort of did that with the left/right panels because the css was insanely complex
[14:10:11] <toddmparker> which might be the case here too :)
[14:10:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm not sure if the performance benefit is worth the effort.
[14:10:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah, I see
[14:10:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I can fold this into my enhancement-order branch and see the performance difference.
[14:10:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes I agree
[14:10:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's the key I'd like to see what the benefit is
[14:10:59] <rdavidwu> yea the top panel reuses most of the code from the left/right panels
[14:11:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The problem is that this will likely break things, because $.mobile.somewidget.prototype.options is unavailable during mobileinit.
[14:11:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, you couldn't configure default widget options during mobileinit.
[14:11:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: O.O
[14:12:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah that's right
[14:12:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was thinking about mitigating this via a "<widget>define" event akin to "<widget>create", but for tthe case where the widget class is being defined, rather than the widget instance being created.
[14:12:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we've have to break the options out and extend the widget later
[14:12:40] <johnbender> s/we've/we would/
[14:12:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah I don't see a gigantic benefit :(
[14:12:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's another way of doing it ...
[14:13:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: but maybe I'm wrong
[14:13:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: i'd wager the prototype definition time in execution is <<<<<<<< dom manip
[14:13:24] <johnbender> even on really basic pages
[14:13:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I know for a fact that when you assign a function to a variable, the function is not parsed until it is executed.
[14:13:57] <toddmparker> rdavidwu: trying to compare the css between the tall and short demos but since all the css is in one file, it's tricky https://dl.dropbox.com/u/15518861/jquery.mobile1.css
[14:14:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm being told by our performance team that most of the time is spent parsing the JS.
[14:14:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: this wouldn't reduce the parsing time though would it?
[14:14:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's still loaded and interpretted
[14:14:35] <johnbender> but I guess that's what you're saying
[14:14:40] <johnbender> storing != parsing
[14:14:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: No. It's JIT, right?
[14:14:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well JIT doesn't mean "no parsing"
[14:15:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: A function is only parsed when it needs to be executed.
[14:15:09] <johnbender> JIT means turning the parsed JS into machine instructions
[14:15:20] <johnbender> big difference
[14:15:31] <johnbender> it might be that it still waits to parse the JS
[14:15:55] <johnbender> but the term Just In Time compiler can mean lots of things
[14:16:08] <johnbender> in the case of Chrome I believe it means compiling to machine instructions
[14:16:21] <johnbender> and that only happens when the code is "hot" ie, it's getting run a lot
[14:16:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I did this: I stuck all of jQuery, jQM, and web-ui-fw into a giant window.theTime = ( new Date() ).getTime(); a = function() { /* all of jQuery, jQM, and web-ui-fw */ }; alert( ( new Date() ).getTime() - window.theTime );
[14:16:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and the time was 0 or 1.
[14:16:42] <johnbender> although what "hot" means is different scenarios with different js engines could be complex
[14:16:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If I execute a() and I measure the time, it's significant.
[14:17:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. I misused the abbreviation.
[14:17:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah that may be the case but that doesn't mean that's "because of the JIT"
[14:17:47] <rdavidwu> toddmparker: hmm, the short one has a height of 7em, and the long one has 25em
[14:17:54] <johnbender> it might even be because of the JIT but that doesn't guarantee a deferred interpretationt
[14:17:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nono. However, it's an obvious optimization step.
[14:18:00] <johnbender> cool
[14:18:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: which browsers?
[14:18:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Both FF and Chrome.
[14:18:17] <rdavidwu> toddmparker: so you can search for these values in the file
[14:18:18] <johnbender> eeeenteresting
[14:18:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: And android native 2.3.5
[14:18:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's why it might be worth avoiding executing all those $.widget calls ...
[14:18:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well if we can find something fairly basic to split those parts out and save that parse time that would be sure hot
[14:19:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Changsuk claimed an improvement of 60 ms.
[14:19:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes parsing is expensive
[14:19:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: 60ms out of?
[14:19:47] <johnbender> % is more informative :)
[14:19:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think 2 seconds ... so, not much, but the 2 seconds include page rendering.
[14:19:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I know ...
[14:20:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I didn't grill him too much about it.
[14:20:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well I'm in if we can get some hard numbers
[14:20:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and the complexity isn't too high
[14:20:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'll finish it in enhancement-order and then we can poke it and prod it.
[14:21:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm really hoping to see some tangible benefits.
[14:21:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah that would be super cool
[14:38:41] <toddmparker> rdavidwu: thanks, as I suspected, we need that height value in a bunch of places of rate animations so it's not going to be a simple "drop it in" kinda thing
[14:38:51] <toddmparker> or easily scripted for that matter
[14:39:40] <toddmparker> we might need to explain to people how to write their own css in this case
[14:41:11] <gseguin> what'd I miss?
[14:41:11] <rdavidwu> yea 
[14:41:22] <agcolom> hey gseguin !
[14:41:53] <agcolom> gseguin: 1.1.2 is out!
[14:42:03] <gseguin> oh shit, really?
[14:42:08] <agcolom> and we closed 1 issue! 
[14:42:22] <gseguin> thanks for getting caught up
[14:42:32] <toddmparker> commented rdavidwu 
[14:42:33] <gseguin> sorry guys, was a crazy day
[14:42:55] <gseguin> so it's all tagged and deployed?
[14:43:08] <toddmparker> yep.
[14:43:23] <gseguin> ok so I need to reset my local 1.1-branch
[14:43:27] <agcolom> gseguin: do you know anything about this one? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4939
[14:44:07] <agcolom> (I'm trying to find easy ones to close or do something about)
[14:44:18] <agcolom> oh no, we actually closed 2 issues! 
[14:44:34] <rdavidwu> toddmparker: thanks i see it
[14:44:39] <gseguin> agcolom: I know nothing about that issue
[14:44:52] <agcolom> ok, do you know who would know?
[14:44:57] <toddmparker> rdavidwu: just another reason why a css pre-processor would be helpful
[14:45:17] <toddmparker> we could at least turn the height into a variable and flow it through all the right places
[14:45:33] <toddmparker> people would still need to manually edit the css, but it would be easier
[14:45:56] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: we really need to talk css this week
[14:46:19] <rdavidwu> hmm yea thats true
[14:46:41] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: agreed
[14:47:25] <gseguin> agcolom: I could look into it tomorrow
[14:47:36] <agcolom> ok, thanks!
[14:49:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: do a hangout thursday before or after weekly meeting?
[14:50:37] <uGoMobi> asheppard (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/453) wanted to join too
[14:55:56] <gseguin> toddmparker: Builder updated with 1.1.2
[14:59:21] <toddmparker> thanks gseguin 
[15:20:09] <johnbender> kinblas: what is this cool meeting you guys are in
[15:20:12] <johnbender> I feel like such an outsider 
[15:20:13] <johnbender> lolol
[15:25:53] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15ehretf opened issue #5789: listview filter unexpected appending string  02http://git.io/phdjLg
[15:33:58] <gseguin> johnbender: did you figure out the test failure on 1.1-stable?
[15:34:48] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm I'm not sure when last you were here but yest
[15:34:50] <johnbender> we deployed
[15:34:54] <johnbender> *yes
[15:35:00] <johnbender> at least I think so :(
[15:35:04] <gseguin> yeah I know we deployed
[15:35:20] <johnbender> I'm having a very hard time figuring out where to see real test failures in travis
[15:35:24] <johnbender> half of them are rake issues :(
[15:35:41] <johnbender> the links don't go anywhere sane by default either
[15:35:55] <johnbender> many times you have to wait for the page to load content 
[15:36:17] <johnbender> it's confusing to my pre RIA brain
[15:36:31] <gseguin> johnbender: yes you deployed I just checked the timestamps on code.jquery.com
[15:36:31] <uGoMobi> gseguin: the fix for the 1.1-stable bug was already there... we just had to cherry-pick it
[15:36:41] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[15:36:50] <gseguin> cool
[15:37:00] <johnbender> gseguin: my confusion has to do with whether the tests are passing or not
[15:37:06] <johnbender> I don't really know :(
[15:37:26] <gseguin> johnbender: you're talking about master, right?
[15:37:40] <johnbender> johnbender: 1.1-stable
[15:37:50] <johnbender> there are tests running against the branch
[15:37:52] <gseguin> there is no travis for 1.1-stable
[15:37:57] <johnbender> o.O
[15:38:04] <gseguin> I don't know why travis is triggering
[15:38:12] <gseguin> can't figure it out
[15:38:16] <uGoMobi> that explains a lot :)
[15:38:33] <johnbender> that does indeed explain alot
[15:38:39] <gseguin> travis works only with 1.3-stable and master
[15:39:05] <gseguin> I don't even know what travis is doing with 1.1-stable and 1.2-stable
[15:39:45] <johnbender> yah according to the docs it shouldn't be building without the travis yml
[15:40:40] <johnbender> gseguin: lol you even have the whitelist config in ther
[15:41:08] <gseguin> johnbender: I know, that's why I'm confused
[15:41:39] <gseguin> should we also check-in the travis yaml file in these branches?
[15:42:20] <johnbender> gseguin: can't
[15:42:22] <johnbender> doesn't make sense
[15:42:33] <johnbender> gseguin: and it only does some branches for some reason
[15:42:56] <johnbender> oh!
[15:42:57] <johnbender> not true
[15:43:03] <johnbender> it did abuild on enhancement order
[15:46:23] <toddmparker> heading home 
[15:46:25] <toddmparker> ttyl
[16:18:03] <gseguin> gnarf: do you know what screws up view.jquerymobile.com's index?
[16:19:15] <gnarf> not yet
[16:19:18] <gnarf> still hunting
[16:19:25] <gseguin> gnarf: ok
[16:23:37] <gseguin> I was just curious so I could either help fix it or workaround it everytime we do the thing that screws it up
