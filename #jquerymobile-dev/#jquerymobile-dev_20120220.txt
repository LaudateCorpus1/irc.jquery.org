[08:16:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: didn't we chat about anchor links prior to Scott's email?
[08:16:14] <johnbender> I'm trying to find the basecamp discussion so I can reconcile the two

[10:41:32] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Ping!
[10:47:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do we have a bb call today?
[10:47:43] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[10:47:53] <johnbender> just got a reminder and I think I can join
[10:48:01] <Wilto> Hey johnbender, are you still “not working” too?
[10:50:17] <johnbender> uh yah something like that :d
[10:50:18] <johnbender> :D
[10:53:55] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: ok I'm on the line waiting so I'll be joining
[10:55:17] <Wilto> Sorry, late on this: I thought it was cancelled…?
[10:55:47] <Wilto> Uh, if not, I think Todd’s incommunicado today.
[10:56:09] <Wilto> johnbender: You mind reppin’ for jQM on our behalf?
[10:58:26] <Wilto> Also, whenever you’re free, question on the way we’re now calling plugins on `create`.
[11:02:12] <johnbender> Wilto: no one's on yet
[11:02:19] <johnbender> I'm guessing it's not happening today :)
[11:02:21] <johnbender> Wilto: shoot
[11:05:39] <johnbender> doesn't look like anyone is joining
[11:05:48] <johnbender> I think it's "Family Day" in canada
[11:05:58] <Wilto> Check it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3529
[11:05:59] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3529 on jquery-mobile, reported by kamikaze (2w, 3d ago): collapsible set corner bug in 1.0.1
[11:07:50] <johnbender> Wilto: might have been on of the bugfixes in 1.0.1 then?
[11:08:11] <johnbender> Wilto: should be easy to bisect between the 1.0 tag and HEAD on 1.0-stable
[11:08:21] * johnbender goes to try
[11:18:00] <johnbender> Wilto: here's a wrinkle with that bug
[11:18:11] <johnbender> the fiddle puts his js in a window load callback
[11:18:22] <johnbender> if I move it to the bottom of the body it fixes the issue

[11:26:25] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (3m, 1w ago): Renamed variable
[11:26:27] <johnbender> gseguin: $
[11:26:29] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[11:55:31] <Wilto> Sorry, back.
[11:56:01] <Wilto> johnbender: Oh, I was running his code in pageinit and seeing the same thing.
[11:56:28] <Wilto> I just noticed that swapping `$.mobile.collapsibleset.prototype.enhanceWithin( e.target )` for `$( e.target ).jqmEnhanceable().collapsibleset()` solved the issue, for my part.
[11:57:10] <Wilto> Which makes sense when calling `create` on the collapsibleset itself a second time.
[11:57:44] <johnbender> Wilto: interesting
[11:57:55] <johnbender> Wilto: did you look at the commit I linked?
[11:58:14] <Wilto> Looking now.
[11:58:32] <Wilto> Oh ho.
[11:58:41] <johnbender> Wilto: that only works if the target is, itself a collapsible set
[11:58:54] <Wilto> Right, yeah.
[11:59:04] <Wilto> Man, that’s a lot of minuses in that commit.
[12:01:14] <Wilto> Guessing gseguin is off the clock today, yeah?
[12:01:58] <johnbender> seems like
[12:02:39] <Wilto> Alright, skipping that issue until we hear back from him.
[12:03:41] <Wilto> Thanks, dude.
[12:04:53] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm going to try reverting that commit real quick to see what happens
[12:05:59] <Wilto> I’d appreciate it, but you are under no obligation or anything what with the holiday and all.
[12:06:51] <johnbender> Wilto: yah, but that shit is bothering me
[12:06:53] <johnbender> Wilto: oh well
[12:07:00] <johnbender> I'll wait to hear back
[12:07:06] <johnbender> revert wasn't an obvious fix
[12:07:12] <Wilto> Ah, gotcha.
[12:24:33] <Wilto> johnbender: Hey, do me a favor? Is http://www.w3.org/community/respimg up for you?
[12:25:10] <Wilto> downforeveryoneoretc. just checks the root domain, which is a separate system. I, uh… I think my little revolution brought that database down.
