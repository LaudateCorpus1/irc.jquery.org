[06:57:03] <Wilto> $1 for the first person to respond to this seven-chapter bug report with “TL;DR.”
[06:57:22] <Wilto> $5 for a response of, simply, “so’s your face.”
[06:57:46] <Wilto> (Hi guys.)
[07:02:29] <Wilto> I kid because I care.
[07:09:22] <Rwhitbeck> Saw this on Twitter http://as001.productscape.com/themeroller.cfm
[07:19:12] <smplstk> Rwhitbeck: looks bleh
[07:19:55] <smplstk> Rwhitbeck: doesn't compare to the actual one.
[07:20:00] <smplstk> also, .cfm :S
[07:23:11] <gseguin> hey Wilto, is that: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2913 ?
[07:23:44] <Wilto> gseguin: Yeah. Don’t get me wrong, I mean, it’s good in that it gives us a public place to say “we’re working on performance, and here’s how.”
[07:24:10] <Wilto> I could live without the “I’m not mad, just disappointed—now go stand in the corner” vibe, though.
[07:24:38] <gseguin> :)
[07:24:51] <gseguin> I thought Todd replied to it, though
[07:25:08] <Wilto> Nah, just emailed us off-thread.
[07:25:22] <Wilto> Gives us an opportunity to write up some details.
[07:25:51] <gseguin> oh ok
[07:25:54] <gseguin> yup
[07:26:05] <Wilto> Such as “so’s your face.”
[07:26:30] <gseguin> lol
[09:19:50] <eddiemonge> tbenzige: https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/issues/25
[09:24:17] <tbenzige> eddiemonge: checking it out now
[09:25:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: well guys it looks like folks are happy about that workaround
[09:27:23] <johnbender> though as evidenced by that other fellow they can get themselves into a similar situation with other possible css that we provide
[09:27:37] <johnbender> I'm going to ack for the overflow property and post in that issue
[09:30:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/SlpeQQ
[09:30:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] whitespace in core css - John Bender
[09:30:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] added comment for Issue #2066 special case - John Bender
[09:33:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: it looks like the only other place we use it is in .ui-content
[09:34:36] <johnbender> so as long as the don't put a node with child selects and `position: absolute` in their content we should be fine :D
[09:35:26] <eddiemonge> this looks like it could be helpful https://github.com/zynga/viewporter
[09:45:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas should really address that performance post but I think we should also temper expectations (especially with the poster)
[09:45:46] <kinblas> johnbender: toddmparker_: I just replied
[09:46:05] <kinblas> to you guys ... not int he issue ... wasn't sure if Todd wanted to hold off or not
[09:48:17] <johnbender> kinblas: I think your point about requests and packaging everything into the initial load has some nuance with phonefap
[09:48:20] <johnbender> lol
[09:48:21] <johnbender> phonefap
[09:48:28] * johnbender goes off to trademark
[09:48:35] <johnbender> phonegap
[09:48:38] <kinblas> heh
[09:48:50] <kinblas> What's up with the renaming of phonegap anyways?
[09:48:52] <johnbender> because a lot of the resources are local
[09:48:54] <kinblas> I like phonegap.
[09:48:57] <johnbender> yah
[09:49:00] <johnbender> callback ?
[09:49:00] <johnbender> ugh
[09:49:04] <kinblas> it sounded kind of generic
[09:49:05] <johnbender> way to throw away your pr
[09:49:15] <kinblas> speaking of that
[09:49:19] <kinblas> Brian never got back to us
[09:49:22] <kinblas> are we meeting today?
[09:49:29] <johnbender> kinblas: Brian?
[09:49:35] <kinblas> Leroux
[09:49:38] <johnbender> ah
[09:49:42] <kinblas> we were supposed to meet today
[09:49:43] <johnbender> dunno thats a good question
[09:49:49] <kinblas> I'll ask
[09:50:06] <johnbender> I don't have anything in my calendar
[09:50:22] <johnbender> but I've proven that to be an unreliable representation of obligations that I have need of fulfilling
[09:50:36] <johnbender> passive voice! RAWR!
[09:51:26] <kinblas> heh
[09:51:46] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/pull/27
[09:51:51] <TehShrike|Work> So the Gmail app is out now for iOS
[09:51:57] <TehShrike|Work> People are lambasting it for using a webview
[09:52:25] <TehShrike|Work> But it's the best webview I've ever seen in an app that I can recall
[09:56:08] <eddiemonge> also how would this "hide" preference be stored per user?
[09:56:08] <eddiemonge> [9:53 AM] <eddiemonge> right now its PHP sessions
[09:56:08] <eddiemonge> [9:53 AM] <eddiemonge> but i want to move it into actual cookies because php sessions are more volatile depending on how they are set
[09:56:08] <eddiemonge> [9:53 AM] <eddiemonge> and moving it to cookies is trivial
[09:56:18] <eddiemonge> [9:54 AM] <eddiemonge> the PHP sessions approach is more a proof of concept at the moment
[09:56:19] <eddiemonge> [9:54 AM] <tbenzige> yeah but as soon as someone clears their cookies, the welcome dialog pops up again, and they say wtf?
[09:56:20] <eddiemonge> [9:54 AM] <eddiemonge> well thats expected and its going to happen to any site they go to
[09:56:35] <eddiemonge> hmm did any of that get sent?
[09:59:57] <tbenzige> eddiemonge: it got sent. i think we're almost at a point where we can get rid of the welcome dialog
[10:00:07] <tbenzige> the help dialog has all the info the user needs
[10:01:01] <eddiemonge> I feel the welcome is kind of necessary as its so useful. I didnt totally understand until I actually read the message

[10:23:08] <johnbender> kinblas: responded to your email
[10:24:25] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah just read it. Good ideas.
[10:24:37] <kinblas> johnbender: especially soliciting core help
[10:26:32] <TehShrike|Work> johnbender: nitro?
[10:27:34] <johnbender> TehShrike|Work: the mobile safari js engine
[10:27:43] <johnbender> might actually just be the jit

[10:28:54] <johnbender> TehShrike|Work: http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/03/confirmed-some-web-apps-not-seeing-ios-43-javascript-speedup.ars
[10:30:03] <TehShrike|Work> Huh, I wasn't up on that news
[10:30:08] <TehShrike|Work> But yeah, it does perform great
[10:30:25] <TehShrike|Work> Animations are pretty smooth
[10:30:50] <TehShrike|Work> Buttons look native
[10:31:08] <TehShrike|Work> The whole UI is a good imitation of iOS native controls
[10:31:38] <TehShrike|Work> If I was looking at a screenshot of the main interface I wouldn't have known it was webview
[10:33:10] <johnbender> It must be fun building an app for a single platform :D
[10:35:02] <TehShrike|Work> Seriously :-P
[10:38:08] <johnbender> kinblas: some measurement of the performance is necessary otherwise it's impossible to know if we've improved
[10:38:18] <kinblas> right-o
[10:38:26] <johnbender> also I'm curious how disabling acceptsData worked out
[10:38:29] <kinblas> johnbender: I've been using rc2 as a base-line
[10:39:19] <kinblas> johnbender: I did that but got sidetracked yesterday ... some of the San Diego Dreamweaver team was in the office yesterday
[10:39:40] <kinblas> If I remember correctly it saved a few hundred milliseconds
[10:40:13] <kinblas> this stuff is so hard to measure sometimes because the browser hiccups sometimes
[10:40:30] <johnbender> kinblas: gc?
[10:40:37] <kinblas> yeah probably
[10:40:53] <kinblas> or something in the OS background
[10:42:22] <johnbender> kinblas: hmm I wonder if we could come up with some benchmarks we could automate
[10:42:32] <johnbender> load time is easy
[10:42:34] <johnbender> since we block
[10:44:10] <kinblas> yeah it would that would be nice
[10:45:36] <kinblas> heh, I need to work on my english
[11:04:09] <toddmparker_> hey guys
[11:04:20] <toddmparker_> had a great meeting with some dev rel guys from nokia
[11:04:26] <toddmparker_> got an n9 for testing
[11:04:37] <toddmparker_> and they are going to be working closely with us in the future
[11:04:37] <Wilto> Pretty sweet gadget, that.
[11:05:02] <toddmparker_> so kinblas johnbender and gseguin - do we have a call with the phonegap guys coming up?
[11:05:25] <toddmparker_> i thought we did, but don't see anything in my calendar now
[11:06:07] <kinblas> toddmparker_: they proposed 4pm pst
[11:06:14] <kinblas> you may want to chime in if that's too late
[11:06:37] <toddmparker_> it's a tricky time for me, usually on my way home
[11:06:53] <toddmparker_> could they do earlier/later?
[11:06:59] <kinblas> toddmparker_: Yeah I figured, so i flagged it with them, but you may want to chime in
[11:07:14] <kinblas> earlier :-)
[11:09:55] <toddmparker_> catching up
[11:09:58] <toddmparker_> was this on email?
[11:11:23] <gseguin> is that today?
[11:11:31] <gseguin> didn't see anything in the mail
[11:11:33] <johnbender> toddmparker_: oooh I want an n9 :D
[11:11:49] <Wilto> It’s pretty sweet, yeah.
[11:11:57] <johnbender> too bad the OS is eol
[11:12:11] * johnbender waves a sad goodby to webOS and Meego
[11:12:27] <johnbender> although technically webOS could see use
[11:13:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2859
[11:14:00] <johnbender> I believe that's just a matter of supporting query params as part of the hash fragment
[11:15:59] <toddmparker_> meego could come back to life too
[11:16:09] <toddmparker_> sounds like it's not 100% gone
[11:16:28] <toddmparker_> they will be selling the N9 in the millions, just not in the US
[11:16:35] <toddmparker_> still need to support it
[11:16:45] <Wilto> Yeah. Sounds like they’ll still be updating it and such.
[11:16:58] <Wilto> I mean, maybe we “don’t know this.” I’m no good at meetings.
[11:17:02] <toddmparker_> johnbender: is that something we could change now or is that a biggie?
[11:17:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: biggie
[11:17:27] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[11:17:39] <toddmparker_> could you comment on it and remove the 1.0 lilestone
[11:17:43] <toddmparker_> milestone
[11:17:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I did :D
[11:18:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas is welcome to contradict my commentary though
[11:18:15] <johnbender> but I've removed the milestone
[11:18:24] <toddmparker_> ah, oops
[11:18:25] <toddmparker_> thanks johnbender
[11:18:37] <kinblas> on what?
[11:18:40] <toddmparker_> all good stuff on the 1.1 email
[11:18:46] <toddmparker_> i will make a wiki page
[11:19:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: I was thinking of making a quick app today that will let us hook up phones, run a perf test and then record the results
[11:19:27] <johnbender> nothing fancy at all
[11:19:42] <johnbender> realizing that this is something that could be folded into testswarm as well
[11:19:48] <johnbender> we need to measure these things
[11:19:54] <johnbender> and doing it with many devices would be nice
[11:20:03] <toddmparker_> i like the idea
[11:20:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: but is it worth the time?
[11:20:17] <toddmparker_> we need to be looking at performance more and tests will help a ton
[11:20:37] <johnbender> at the very least we can do the loading test on a that list item page
[11:20:44] <johnbender> maybe a few others
[11:20:46] <toddmparker_> johnbender: would this measure kin's improvements?
[11:20:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that's the idea
[11:20:59] <toddmparker_> if so and it would just take today, then it's worth it
[11:21:01] <johnbender> so we can track this stuff
[11:21:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kk I'll see what I can fire up, luckily the backend should be trivial
[11:21:29] <kinblas> johnbender: you can hook into the page notifications mechanism to figure out some simple timings
[11:21:33] <Wilto> johnbender: Can we somehow incorporate a fundraiser-style thermometer image?
[11:21:35] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #199: SUCCESS in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/199/
[11:21:36] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Documentation fix for #2914 - Layout events .trigger('updatelayout'); doesn't work with delay/speed
[11:21:36] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Sometimes things don't get more "dynamic" if you say "dynamic" too many times.
[11:21:38] <Wilto> (I’ll see myself out.)
[11:21:53] <johnbender> Wilto: it would be nice to graph the numbers me thinks
[11:22:05] <kinblas> Wilto:  lol ... what's at the top?
[11:22:07] <Wilto> Yeah, joking aside, that would be really cool.
[11:22:10] <toddmparker_> is it just a single bar or are there multiple data points?
[11:22:26] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I want to start with the load perf first
[11:22:29] <johnbender> we can add more later
[11:22:47] <Wilto> Either way, it would look real good in a “1.0 Released” blog post, too.
[11:22:54] <johnbender> the back end need only be an end point with mapping between a data point and a single result
[11:23:00] <toddmparker_> if it's just a bar or two, you can just do a div with a width
[11:23:09] <johnbender> Wilto: yah we'll have to see if we want to make it public
[11:23:13] <toddmparker_> if you want to chart stuff, you could use our visualize plugin
[11:23:13] <toddmparker_> http://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/update_to_jquery_visualize_accessible_charts_with_html5_from_designing_with/
[11:23:24] <toddmparker_> just dump a table and call the plugin on it
[11:23:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I'll worry about the actual graphing if I get this up fast enough :D
[11:23:34] <toddmparker_> not sure if too heavy for mobile tho
[11:23:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: scottjehl showed me that :D
[11:23:38] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:23:43] <Wilto> toddmparker_ and I just like cool colorful charts, really.
[11:23:47] <toddmparker_> just use a huge number in text and call it a day
[11:23:51] <kinblas> wow this doesn't surprise me ... http://jsperf.com/compare-markup-vs-createelement-jquery-collection
[11:24:00] <Wilto> I mean, anything with bright colors. Jingle some keys at us, etc.
[11:24:18] <johnbender> kinblas: $()
[11:24:35] <johnbender> if javascript had a type system this wouldn't be a problem
[11:24:43] <johnbender> :/
[11:24:45] <johnbender> lol
[11:24:57] <kinblas> heh
[11:25:33] <johnbender> introspection as a substitute for object dispatch/pattern matching results in poor performance
[11:26:03] <Wilto> Wow. I’ve read about this before kinblas, but I didn’t know it was such a major difference.
[11:26:40] <eddiemonge> is the same thing as $('#id') is slower than $(document.getElementById('id'))
[11:26:40] <kinblas> Well, we're just chock full of "create markup from my string" goodness
[11:26:49] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yes
[11:26:56] <toddmparker_> woah
[11:27:02] <johnbender> its just because there's a lot of parsing that has to happen to know what to do with that string
[11:27:08] <toddmparker_> can we just use that jsperf site to test?
[11:27:16] <kinblas> johnbender: exact-o-mundo
[11:27:46] <eddiemonge> johnbender: well with ids its not as noticeable since ids get redirect to getEleById pretty quickly
[11:27:54] <johnbender> kinblas: can we change to the object syntax for dom element creation?
[11:28:02] <johnbender> eddiemonge: "pretty quickly"
[11:28:09] <johnbender> string manip is just _slow_ in general
[11:28:24] <eddiemonge> johnbender: it bypasses sizzle entirely
[11:28:32] <kinblas> johnbender: it's worth investigating ... I got some speedup yesterday by doing that for button markup
[11:28:36] <johnbender> tranditionally interpreted languages drop down to C for complex string handling
[11:29:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I have no doubt the difference is small in some cases but identifying an id selector still takes cycles
[11:29:40] <toddmparker_> every little optimization helps
[11:29:41] <johnbender> "some cases" meaning things like #id
[11:31:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I think we might be able to use that site
[11:31:31] <kinblas> also, another tip ... I got some speedup yesterday with listview by simply reducing the number of function calls we make ... for example, if we're going to be searching each list-item for paragraphs, and headers ... don't do it 400 x 2 times ...do it 2 times by just searching the entire list
[11:31:54] <eddiemonge> johnbender: toddmparker_ the code for it is on github now
[11:32:25] <toddmparker_> kin - keep jamming on this stuff. you're making great progress
[11:32:50] <johnbender> hmm
[11:33:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it looks like it will require some work since it doesn't let you add js to the head
[11:33:33] <kinblas> johnbender: you talking about jsperf?
[11:33:40] <johnbender> kinblas: yes
[11:33:45] <johnbender> am I missing something?
[11:33:45] <kinblas> doesn't it have a "setup" section?
[11:34:01] <johnbender> it does but it adds the tags to the body
[11:34:15] <kinblas> oh
[11:34:18] <toddmparker_> like injects JS into the body?
[11:34:53] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it just renders the page with the script tags in the body
[11:35:23] <toddmparker_> they have a button to include mylibrary!! <script src="//www.cinsoft.net/mylib099-min.js"></script>
[11:35:33] <toddmparker_> David Mark has made the big time
[11:36:26] <Wilto> Have we considered switching over to that?
[11:36:36] <eddiemonge> jquery core is already using it ;)
[11:36:45] <Wilto> I mean, the “jQuery” fad will never catch on.
[11:36:47] <eddiemonge> lol jk for anyone not in the know watching this channel
[11:43:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright I'm going to get a snack and do a bit of hacking, where is that list page so I can borrow it
[11:43:35] <johnbender> assuming its more complex than just a huge as ul
[11:43:40] <johnbender> *huge ASS
[11:43:53] <johnbender> that's what I meant to say
[11:44:24] * johnbender had been hoping someone would pop into the room between the original and the correction
[11:44:40] <Wilto> Todd stepped away—I think it is just a gigantic ul with a button in each item.
[11:44:56] <johnbender> in tests/speed/
[11:45:00] <johnbender> methinks
[11:51:50] <kinblas> gseguin: So here's another perf test related to the should we search the page every time versus once and filter ... http://jsperf.com/multiple-queries-vs-single-query-multiple-filter
[11:51:56] <kinblas> according to this, we should be filtering
[11:52:16] <kinblas> not sure why we don't see tremendous speedups, but maybe it's just due to the fact that enhancement in general is just slow
[11:52:45] <johnbender> kinblas: most likely its lost on a sea of worse issues
[11:52:51] <kinblas> lol
[11:52:52] <johnbender> *it's
[11:53:07] <toddmparker_> hey all, i'm back
[11:53:11] <Wilto> “Polishing the brass on the Titanic,” as they say.
[11:53:13] <johnbender> I'd imagine we'll get to the point where that becomes relevant
[11:53:15] <toddmparker_> i have a call at 3:00 tho
[11:53:35] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah
[11:53:43] <kinblas> but it's good to know I wasn't on crack :-)
[11:53:49] <johnbender> danheberden: question for you if you're around
[11:54:14] <kinblas> johnbender: I suppose it also matters more on browsers that don't support native querySelectorAll
[11:54:28] <johnbender> yassir

[11:59:15] <johnbender> ?tell eddiemonge where do I log into the jqm server I'll probably need to poke around to set up the perf stuff
[11:59:15] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.

[12:00:00] <johnbender> there we go
[12:13:30] <jzaefferer> you guys saw this? http://as001.productscape.com/themeroller.cfm
[12:16:23] <kinblas> jzaefferer: Yeah, that came out while we were in the middle of working on mobile TR
[12:16:41] <jzaefferer> did someone try and ask them to rename it?
[12:33:55] <Wilto> Yeah, I really know know how to make bot-t flip tables and say nonsensical things.
[12:34:49] <Wilto> ?awesome
[12:34:49] <bot-t> 𝖆𝖜𝖊𝖘𝖔𝖒𝖊
[12:36:38] <Wilto> Whatup garann and jzaefferer.
[12:36:48] <toddmparker_> hey, i'm back
[12:36:53] <Wilto> Also Todd.
[12:38:00] <garann> hey Wilto
[12:38:19] <Wilto> I learned something today: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter#Unicode
[12:38:23] <toddmparker_> hey garann - welcome! sounds like you might jump in and lend a hand?
[12:38:40] <garann> thanks toddmparker_ :)
[12:38:42] <Wilto> My fictional knuckle tattoo tweets just jumped to a whole new level.
[12:38:45] <garann> yeah, i'd like to!
[12:39:11] <toddmparker_> awesomesauce
[12:39:28] <toddmparker_> ^^ jzaefferer will appreciate that
[12:39:51] <toddmparker_> just let us know how we can help get you up and going
[12:40:15] <toddmparker_> no shortage of bugs to fix, docs to write, etc. - we appreciate the help
[12:40:44] <garann> any explicit direction you wanna give me would be awesome
[12:41:07] <garann> i've never contributed to any sort of open source project in my life, so kinda not sure where to start
[12:41:45] <Wilto> Actually, I should have asked: you pretty well versed in GitHub?
[12:42:28] <garann> i think so
[12:42:53] <toddmparker_> what type of things are you fired up about?
[12:43:07] <toddmparker_> Wilto for example, loves IE bugs
[12:43:13] <Wilto> LOVE ‘EM.
[12:43:16] <garann> haha, that's sick
[12:43:26] <Wilto> Also CSS fixes that cannot be explained by any rational person.
[12:43:26] <eddiemonge> well who doesnt?
[12:43:27] <bot-t> (44 mins 10 secs ago) <johnbender> tell eddiemonge where do I log into the jqm server I'll probably need to poke around to set up the perf stuff
[12:43:39] <garann> forms, widgets, that kind of thing, i guess?
[12:43:40] <toddmparker_> the easiest thing might be to create a tag that I can tack onto issues that you might want to tackle
[12:43:44] <eddiemonge> johnbender: jqadmin@jquerymobile.com
[12:43:52] <garann> but also app organization, don't know if that's at all relevant
[12:44:04] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: have you tried lists on a win 7.5 phone yet?
[12:44:20] <toddmparker_> for the short term, we'd have you focud on fixes and writing unit tests and docs and such
[12:44:26] <garann> cool
[12:44:29] <toddmparker_> and have you submit pull requests
[12:44:42] <toddmparker_> that's the general plan
[12:44:53] <garann> i'm dfw :)
[12:44:56] <eddiemonge> pull requests are fun
[12:45:03] <toddmparker_> so knowing what areas you're interested in can help me steer stuff your way
[12:45:58] <garann> broadly, i'm interested in what used to fall under the heading of dhtml
[12:46:05] <garann> functionality and interactivity kind of stuff
[12:46:10] <toddmparker_> have you built stuff with jQM?
[12:46:17] <Wilto> We got widgets for days.
[12:46:33] <garann> just starting to
[12:46:34] <toddmparker_> cool. we love dhtml ;)
[12:46:38] <eddiemonge> Wilto: do you like comparing code side by side?
[12:46:43] <garann> who doesn't? :)
[12:46:52] <Wilto> Do I!
[12:46:57] <toddmparker_> so atm, we're fixing bugs for the final 1.0 release
[12:47:11] <toddmparker_> here are the items tagged right now for this
[12:47:13] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=10&sort=updated&direction=desc&state=open
[12:47:47] <garann> yeah, i was looking through those
[12:48:27] <toddmparker_> if anything there looks like something you might want to grab, give a shout and see if anyone is workingon it
[12:48:42] <toddmparker_> we assign people to issues that are prioritized, but they might not be working on them
[12:49:02] <garann> ahhh.. i was thinking that assigned == in progress
[12:49:05] <garann> good to know
[12:49:10] <Wilto> And we have all manner of gadgets over here, so just give the word if you want us to test a fix across any/all devices.
[12:49:24] <garann> cool
[12:49:33] <toddmparker_> in theory, but not always.
[12:49:36] <toddmparker_> lazy devs
[12:49:48] <toddmparker_> oh, what devices are you packin'
[12:49:52] <garann> in theory i have a bunch in my office, too
[12:50:08] <toddmparker_> great
[12:50:39] <toddmparker_> here's a good one for ya
[12:50:41] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1447
[12:51:16] <toddmparker_> pretty atomic and straightforward. some issues are tricky business that take some time to get your head around
[12:51:43] <toddmparker_> so i added the "garann" label and tagged this issue to you
[12:51:59] <eddiemonge> tbenzige: pass one. https://github.com/eddiemonge/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/tree/working
[12:52:06] <eddiemonge> im only about half way though app.js
[12:52:08] <toddmparker_> only committers can be assigned in a legit way, but labels work. you can filter to your label
[12:52:29] <eddiemonge> Wilto: want to check that out too? i think i have a bug somewhere in there since the themes arent rendering
[12:52:32] <Wilto> It seems like only yesterday that I, too, had a label.
[12:52:52] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender - maybe you can tell garann about testing process and such
[12:52:52] <eddiemonge> its probably a typo or something since i was tired at 3 in the morning when i was writing a lot of it
[12:53:07] <toddmparker_> now you're all grown up wilto (sniff)
[12:53:47] <garann> zomg, my very own label!
[12:53:49] * garann reads
[12:54:00] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: what are you up to on TR?
[12:54:15] <toddmparker_> you're *famous* now garann
[12:54:21] <Wilto> Yeah, what am I checking?
[12:54:26] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: massive code cleanup and optimizations
[12:54:29] <garann> haha
[12:54:39] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/eddiemonge/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/commit/bde2d4e9c1e81ea5ab484e6308e5573e5b3451cd
[12:55:10] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: but would like a third opinion on https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/pull/27
[12:55:21] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: try to keep these small and atomic pulls. doing a big re-write is going to be to hard to review/test/deploy
[12:55:37] <toddmparker_> i'd hate to have you spend a lot of cycles and have us not pull it in
[12:56:23] <eddiemonge> its a bit hard to do on this since pretty much every line in the file is being touched
[12:58:08] <eddiemonge> already let tbenzige know about it and hes expecting it
[12:59:48] <toddmparker_> this much chrun  just makes me very nervous
[13:13:08] <gseguin> kinblas: sorry I'm stuck into some merge nightmare
[13:14:12] <Wilto> Rebase that sucka.
[13:14:21] <kinblas> toddmparker_: fyi, in terms of 1.0 bugs on my plate, I've only been focusing the last few days on performance, so if anyone wants to take a crack at my list they're welcome to it.
[13:14:21] <gseguin> :)
[13:14:28] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm about to reply to 2859
[13:14:38] <toddmparker_> sure kinblas
[13:14:48] <toddmparker_> the list isn't too bad right now for 1.0
[13:14:56] <toddmparker_> lots of logistics in there
[13:15:46] <toddmparker_> speaking of which..this ticket
[13:15:48] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2634
[13:15:55] <toddmparker_> we already made the structure css file
[13:16:28] <toddmparker_> for 1.0, are we going to make any CDN versions of the JS combinations here or just wait for the download builder
[13:16:54] <toddmparker_> JS
[13:16:54] <toddmparker_> * jquery.mobile.core.min.js (includes all "core" files, like widget factory, page, navigation, init )
[13:16:54] <toddmparker_> * jquery.mobile.core.transitions.min.js (includes above file, plus transitions.js)
[13:16:54] <toddmparker_> * jquery.mobile.min.js - the whole package that we currently offer
[13:17:27] <toddmparker_> i'm a bit torn on this. sort of think we should keep it simple and push on the d/l builder once 1.0 ships
[13:17:38] <toddmparker_> once you make these, it's hard to take 'em away
[13:18:31] <Wilto> Think I lean towards waiting on the builder.
[13:18:42] <kinblas> toddmparker_: we should focus on stability, performance, feature-parity ... the download builder can bet knocked after 1.0
[13:18:50] <kinblas> knocked out
[13:19:32] <kinblas> I know John was experimenting with dependency stuff, and if we wait, we can get some time form Tyler too
[13:19:32] <toddmparker_> oh sure
[13:19:41] <toddmparker_> this wasn't the d/l builder
[13:19:42] <gseguin> talking about that, I experimented with AMD
[13:19:57] <toddmparker_> but a ticket to make 1 or 2 preset js configs, sort of like structure.css
[13:20:00] * gseguin retrieves the branch
[13:20:09] <toddmparker_> but i think this may not be worth the hassle
[13:20:10] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ah ok sorry
[13:20:24] <toddmparker_> people can always make custom builds for now
[13:20:27] <gseguin> https://github.com/gseguin/jquery-mobile/tree/amd
[13:21:29] <gseguin> works pretty well and with almond.js add just a few bytes (750) to "simulate" require/define
[13:22:11] <gseguin> the only trick is the dependency on jQuery, which I had to inject manually in the built file for now
[13:24:32] <eddiemonge> and would need to add uglify.js
[13:24:47] <gseguin> that's the default minifier in r.js
[13:28:31] <johnbender> kinblas: thanks
[13:29:25] <johnbender> gseguin: it can be configured to use the closure compiler I thought?
[13:29:36] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ^^
[13:29:41] <gseguin> yes, either
[13:29:43] <johnbender> cool
[13:29:56] <gseguin> but by default it uses UglifyJS
[13:29:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: kinblas: yes, lets punt on the builder
[13:30:14] <johnbender> gseguin: seems to have it well in hand
[13:30:19] <johnbender> so we can probably get it out quickkly
[13:30:24] <toddmparker_> I just commented and closed that issue
[13:30:24] <johnbender> I need me some 1.0
[13:30:40] <toddmparker_> we got structure.css and the js bundles seem sort of messy
[13:31:08] <toddmparker_> i was thinking about just having a widget-free JS but even that is sort of eh
[13:47:13] <kinblas> toddmparker_: if we have a widget-free JS, then we really do need that 'mobileready' event we punted on
[13:47:29] <kinblas> because most folks today are going off of the page events
[13:47:38] <kinblas> to figure out when things are ready
[13:47:48] <toddmparker_> yeah
[13:47:57] <toddmparker_> i think waiting and doing this right is better
[13:48:12] <toddmparker_> i'm a fan doing doing less, but doing it right
[13:48:21] <Wilto> What if we kept all the semicolons in a separate file okay I’ll stop now.
[13:52:25] <toddmparker_> johnbender: did this fix make it in? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2803
[13:52:38] <toddmparker_> related: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2915#issuecomment-2609314
[14:04:25] <toddmparker_> so where did we land with the benchmark stuff kinblas gseguin johnbender
[14:04:58] <kinblas> toddmparker_: which benchmark stuff?
[14:05:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm working on building something simple
[14:05:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: but I think that fix is in
[14:05:36] <johnbender> let me check if the tests are there
[14:05:41] <toddmparker_> earlier yo guys were kicking around ways to benchmark perf
[14:06:16] <toddmparker_> yeah johnbender? i couldn't tell exactly what was happening
[14:06:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the tests are there, let me do a quick local test
[14:08:55] <toddmparker_> okey dokey
[14:09:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: works fine locally does not work with latest
[14:09:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sigh
[14:09:36] <johnbender> now I have no clue what's going on
[14:09:40] <toddmparker_> wha?
[14:09:58] <toddmparker_> is your local way out of date?
[14:10:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: no
[14:11:24] <toddmparker_> so when you say it works locally, that's your copy of master
[14:11:43] <toddmparker_> but it's broken on the cdn version of latest?
[14:11:44] <Wilto> This the data-role="none" thing?
[14:11:51] <toddmparker_> yeah
[14:12:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll handle it
[14:12:57] <toddmparker_> ok, just curious where this was at because of that other issue. maybe that will be fixed with this too?
[14:13:28] <toddmparker_> shouldn't matter where the element is nested data-role="none" should be respected since we're looking at attrs
[14:13:35] <toddmparker_> no means no
[14:13:36] <toddmparker_> :)
[14:15:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it works with test but not the latest on the cdn
[14:16:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://jsbin.com/eyuput/4
[14:16:03] <johnbender> with test
[14:16:08] <johnbender> that's with test
[14:16:16] <johnbender> http://jsbin.com/eyuput/
[14:16:19] <johnbender> thats with the cdn
[14:16:29] <johnbender> so yes it's fixedish
[14:16:35] <toddmparker_> hmm
[14:16:45] <toddmparker_> run that locally and they are enhanced?
[14:16:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: let me get the commit with the fix and I'll post to those two issues
[14:16:55] <toddmparker_> ok
[14:16:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: not enhanced locally

[14:23:51] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] whitespace in mobile widget - John Bender
[14:25:28] <eddiemonge> github has a shortener now?
[14:26:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ?
[14:26:37] <eddiemonge> git.io
[14:26:46] <eddiemonge> the link from that last commit
[14:35:09] <kinblas> toddparker: johnbender: I broke down and wrote a plugin that allows folks to pass query params to their embedded pages. You can point folks here: https://github.com/jblas/jquery-mobile-plugins/tree/master/page-params
[14:40:28] <johnbender> kinblas: "passing" query params to "pages" seems bizare to me
[14:41:01] <eddiemonge> only about 600 lines left. whew
[14:41:20] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah, doesn't degrade very well :-)
[14:41:27] <kinblas> but man, I just want to stop the issues
[14:41:29] <kinblas> :-)
[14:41:35] <johnbender> complete tanget
[14:41:38] <johnbender> tangent
[14:41:44] <johnbender> php is a pain in the ass
[14:41:53] <johnbender> not only is it unfamiliar
[14:42:11] <Wilto> If I had a time machine, my first stop would be a visit to the first browser dev that decided that overflow: hidden should obviously clear floated elements.
[14:42:14] <johnbender> but you can build applications in C style with method prefixes
[14:42:40] <johnbender> OR dispatch on objects
[14:42:44] <Wilto> While we’re at it, float: left should make backgrounds green, and border: 1px dashed red; should make the element display: table-row.
[14:42:59] <johnbender> and best of all
[14:43:08] <johnbender> you can swallow errors whole with a single operator
[14:43:11] <johnbender> @
[14:43:21] * johnbender falls out of his chair
[14:43:29] <kinblas> heh
[14:43:35] <Wilto> That one is scary.
[14:44:24] <Wilto> It’s like developer peek-a-boo. If you can’t see the error, it has obviously vanished completely. Problem: solved!
[14:44:44] <kinblas> johnbender: heh, when I read that Silent Lucidity started in iTunes
[14:45:41] <johnbender> kinblas: lol
[14:45:45] <johnbender> I am indeed crying
[14:48:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I love that my address is Adobe Systems
[14:49:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: 6109 Melvil St.Culver City, CA 90232
[14:49:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://maps.google.com/maps?gcx=c&client=ubuntu&channel=cs&q=6109+Melvil+St.Culver+City,+CA+90232+street+view&um=1&ie=UTF-8&hl=en&sa=N&tab=wl
[14:49:31] <johnbender> ADOBE SYSTEMS!
[14:49:51] * johnbender sighs about spraying his home address all over the internet with a mispaste
[14:50:23] <toddmparker_> so your home is now an official adobe office now
[14:50:29] <toddmparker_> you sleep in a cubicle?
[14:50:44] <toddmparker_> ^^ hey stalkers!

[14:52:00] <toddmparker_> wha? no way. leaving after a good probing?

[14:54:07] <johnbender> and I can't know if they probed me
[14:54:13] <johnbender> they don't leave memories
[14:54:34] <toddmparker_> i heard the smell like wet cardboard. true: y/n
[14:55:08] <toddmparker_> i hear they wear drakkar noir to cover it up. true: y/n
[14:55:31] <Wilto> Are we talkin’ aliens up in here?
[14:56:29] * johnbender goes to google drakkar noir
[14:58:02] <Wilto> johnbender: That’s Todd’s excessively-applied cologne of choice, when he goes out clubbin’.
[14:58:17] <toddmparker_> my bro wore so much of that cologne in high scroll, my parents had to confiscate it
[14:58:33] <gseguin> ?g _drakar noir_ @ johnbender
[14:58:33] <toddmparker_> gotta smell bro-tastic

[15:21:31] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #200: SUCCESS in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/200/
[15:21:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> john.m.bender: whitespace in mobile widget
[15:24:45] <toddmparker_> alright guys, heading out
[15:24:51] <toddmparker_> have a good one
[15:28:13] <johnbender> kinblas: alright I've got a page in place that can report stats, refresh itself on new revisions and store the states in a sqlite db
[15:28:20] <johnbender> *stats
[15:28:29] <kinblas> got URL?
[15:28:36] <kinblas> how are you gathering?
[15:28:58] <johnbender> kinblas: it's not posted yet, I'm going to do something quickly for my wife
[15:29:02] <johnbender> and then I'll be back
[15:29:09] <johnbender> kinblas: that's one thing I wanted to ask
[15:29:19] <johnbender> I'm just recording the time and then reporting the difference at the bottom of the page
[15:29:22] <johnbender> brb
[16:04:31] <johnbender> kinblas: how are you getting that number currently
[16:04:54] <johnbender> kinblas: $(function(){ /* record here */ }); ?
[16:05:36] <johnbender> are you monkey patching mobile.initializePage?
[16:05:54] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm using the mother of all monkey-patchers
[16:05:59] <kinblas> profiler.js
[16:06:24] <johnbender> kinblas: doesn't that bloat your load time a bit though?
[16:06:36] <kinblas> yeah
[16:06:39] <johnbender> especially with such high method call freq
[16:06:52] <kinblas> for our purposes we just need to monkey patch some key places
[16:06:54] <johnbender> kinblas: but in this case a monkey patch of init page should get us what we want eh?
[16:07:03] <kinblas> that's why I said we can also leverage the page notifications
[16:07:03] <johnbender> this is for initialload only
[16:07:10] <johnbender> ah
[16:07:14] <johnbender> indeed
[16:09:38] <johnbender> kinblas: pageinit then?
[16:10:00] <johnbender> yah I guess that makes sense
[16:10:22] <kinblas> so if you want the total enhancement time
[16:10:36] <kinblas> you need to notate time in pagebeforecreate
[16:10:46] <kinblas> and then subract that from the time you get in pageinit
[16:11:03] <kinblas> you can also get the "load" time of a page
[16:11:14] <kinblas> by notating the time from pagebeforeload
[16:11:22] <kinblas> and then subtracting the time from pagebeforecreate
[16:12:26] <johnbender> kinblas: on it
[16:16:46] <eddiemonge> tbenzige: im actually finishing up that massive change soon
[16:17:50] <eddiemonge> tbenzige: whats this line supposed to do? https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/blob/master/js/app.js#L1447
[16:18:17] <eddiemonge> specifically the selector. is the " = this" part a typo?
[16:18:47] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #201: SUCCESS in 10 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/201/
[16:18:48] <jqm-jenkins-bot> todd: Added info on URL passing between pages to scripting and Ajax nav pages
[16:19:34] <tbenzige> to be honest, eddiemonge im not sure. that code was jacked from the farbtastic demos
[16:19:50] <tbenzige> i think orignially he had a different opacity on focus, but i changed it
[16:19:54] <tbenzige> you can probably get rid of the line
[16:21:33] <eddiemonge> how much longer you working today? and when are you working next?
[16:26:29] <tbenzige> not much longer. and will be working again on friday
[16:27:34] <eddiemonge> ok, ill have something for you to review then
[16:36:53] <johnbender> kinblas: wow its almost a second on desktop chrome :(
[16:37:11] <johnbender> kinblas: for the 400 item listview
[16:39:52] <kinblas> johnbender: and about half of that was enhancement
[16:46:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender created list-perf (+1 new commit): http://git.io/KEDogA

[16:47:37] <johnbender> lawl
[16:47:40] <johnbender>  I added the db

[16:50:02] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/list-perf] simple performance recording for page loads - John Bender
[16:50:59] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/branches/list-perf
[16:51:02] <johnbender> thats the start
[16:51:09] <johnbender>  http://git.io/Zvch8Q
[16:51:11] <johnbender> diff there
[16:51:38] <johnbender> we just have to do some auth stuff and get sqlite installed to put this up on test
[16:51:41] <johnbender> or stage
[16:53:11] <johnbender> the stats will hinge on grouping based on the agent string
[16:53:14] <johnbender> or some function thereof
[16:53:32] <johnbender> now I need to eat some lunch
[16:53:33] <johnbender> :/
[16:53:57] <kinblas> johnbender: a little late eh?
[16:54:11] <kinblas> johnbender: so I suppose there would be some page we could hit to get the stats out of the data base?
[17:01:39] <johnbender> kinblas: tests/speed/stats/
[17:01:43] <johnbender> json
[17:01:51] <johnbender> which I'm going to through into a graph
[17:02:00] <johnbender> of some sort or another
[17:02:11] <johnbender> that can of course be dumped into a page instead
[17:04:01] <johnbender> kinblas: also the php I wrote is horrid
[17:05:51] <kinblas> heh
[17:05:59] <kinblas> johnbender: is there such a thing?
[17:17:05] <johnbender> kinblas: as horrid php?
[17:17:13] <johnbender> oh I think so my friend
[17:17:28] <johnbender> realizing that you mean to suggest that it's already so bad it can't get worse
[17:18:50] <kinblas> johnbender: I came from the PERL world early on in my career .. I'm used to reading PHP type code :-)
[17:24:02] <johnbender> is it weird that I want to go back and brush up on my C?
[17:24:18] <johnbender> that's like the second thing on my stack of "want to dos"
[18:16:34] <johnbender> arg
[18:16:38] <johnbender> netsplit
[18:19:05] <eTiger13> always fun
