[00:20:07] <gnarf> nice
[00:20:17] <gnarf> anyone here know anything about the mobile build process?
[00:31:17] <uGoMobi> hey gnarf 
[00:32:05] <uGoMobi> gnarf: maybe I can help
[00:32:09] <gnarf> so
[00:32:13] <gnarf> builds for view
[00:32:26] <gnarf> give me a minute, ill bounce back and talk
[00:32:49] <uGoMobi> ok
[00:34:37] <gnarf> so after it checks out a version
[00:34:40] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure/blob/puppet-master/manifests/nodes/services.pp#L25-L46
[00:34:47] <gnarf> the new view thing will run this script
[00:34:51] <gnarf> pretty simple
[00:34:59] <gnarf> but im wondering if there is something else it should do for tags/etc
[00:38:17] <uGoMobi> gnarf: I can't view that script (404)
[00:38:44] <gnarf> uGoMobi: oh, you aren't on infra list
[00:38:47] <gnarf> lemme gist it
[00:38:48] <uGoMobi> right
[00:39:08] <gnarf> https://gist.github.com/gnarf37/27bdac2623e2b32eeb11
[00:45:27] <uGoMobi> gnarf: I don't think you need to do something else
[00:45:37] <uGoMobi> for tags
[00:51:20] <gnarf> just wondering how the "version dev" might be fixed
[00:52:02] <gnarf> new view is up
[00:54:18] <uGoMobi> cool
[00:55:55] <uGoMobi> gnarf: version dev for latest isn't a problem if you ask me
[00:56:20] <uGoMobi> gnarf: only tags should have right version info from version.txt
[00:56:51] <gnarf> right, they still say dev tho
[00:57:01] <uGoMobi> yeah I see
[00:57:08] <gnarf> http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/version.txt
[01:01:09] <uGoMobi> gnarf: I think we have to fix that
[01:01:29] <uGoMobi> in our JS
[01:01:42] <gnarf> well, think on it
[01:01:46] <gnarf> just don't change history over it
[01:01:51] <uGoMobi> it now looks for $.mobile.version but I can't find that anymore in our code
[01:05:20] <uGoMobi> ah, found $.mobile.version

[03:09:06] <Changsuk> Hi, All
[05:42:31] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[05:46:50] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[06:02:38] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[06:04:21] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[06:05:24] <frequent> I'm sitting over a JQM page being pulled into the DOM and although pagecreate triggers, all widgets stay un-enhanced
[06:05:39] <frequent> widgets being added dynamically
[06:06:16] <arschmitz> frequent what event are you adding the widget on?
[06:06:56] <frequent> arschmitz: pageinit
[06:07:11] <arschmitz> its too late then because the look for and enhance on pagecreate
[06:07:37] <frequent> ah. what should I bind to? I thought pageinit was the "earliest"
[06:07:43] <arschmitz> pagecreate
[06:07:56] <arschmitz> use pagecreate to monkey with raw markup pre enhancement
[06:07:57] <frequent> ok. trying. thanks!!
[06:08:10] <frequent> Ok. Let's see.
[06:09:43] <frequent> arschmitz: nope. it works the first time "page B" is pulled in. The 2nd time (going A>B>A>B), the page is dead
[06:10:40] <arschmitz> is B ever being removed or are you cacheing it?
[06:12:46] <frequent> caching is disabled and I'm letting JQM handle page nav. I'm also binding to pageremove which triggers, so: it's being removed
[06:13:05] <arschmitz> hmmm 
[06:13:56] <frequent> should I hack together an example?
[06:14:09] <arschmitz> and i assume you are doing something to the effect of $( document ).on( "pagecreate","#b", function.....
[06:14:23] <arschmitz> yeah that would help so i can actually see whats going on
[06:14:24] <frequent> $(document).on('pagecreate', 'div:jqmData(role="page")', function() {
[06:14:48] <frequent> ok, give me a few mins
[06:15:19] <arschmitz> frequent: fun side note if you are using 1.3 you should switch to $.mobile.document.on(
[06:15:28] <arschmitz> its a lot faster
[06:15:34] <arschmitz> you can do same with window
[06:15:42] <frequent> ah. will do.
[06:16:28] <arschmitz> just a minor improvment to performance not calling $ each time but it ads up
[06:51:42] <frequent> arschmitz: uGoMobi: 
[06:51:43] <frequent> Here is the page: http://www.franckreich.de/members/export/c/p/index.html
[06:51:45] <frequent> Click on "Compare", Go back, Click "Compare" again and the page stays "uncreated"
[06:51:47] <frequent> Info: I'm using requireJS and renderJS (load encapsulated snippets = gadgets). When a gadget is ready, it triggers an "render_enhance" event on which I'm trying to call "create" on the gadget. 
[06:51:49] <frequent> Main js file: http://www.franckreich.de/members/export/c/js/controller.js
[06:52:43] <frequent> you can manually call $('#results').trigger('pagecreate') from the console on the 2nd page. Then it gets enhanced.
[06:53:19] <arschmitz> ok im looking now
[06:54:42] <frequent> let me know if you have any questions
[07:02:49] <arschmitz> probably take me a bit to muddle through im not real familier with renderJS
[07:04:14] <frequent> yes, I was afraid it might be a little complex.
[07:04:46] <frequent> renderjs triggers an ajax request and appends the content to the gadget placeholder
[07:04:53] <frequent> in a nutshell
[07:05:21] <frequent> from inside the appended content I trigger a custom-event when everything is set
[07:05:30] <frequent> on this event I try to trigger("create")
[07:07:33] <frequent> arschmitz: anyway, np & thanks for checking
[07:07:47] <arschmitz> yeah ill see what i can figure out if anything

[10:41:30] <jrburke> _|Nix|_: hi
[10:41:48] <_|Nix|_> jrburke: Hey! Are you the author of requirejs?
[10:42:00] <jrburke> _|Nix|_: yes
[10:42:21] <_|Nix|_> jrburke: I need some help with using jQM as a submodule in another project.
[10:42:31] <_|Nix|_> jrburke: I sent you an email on this topic as well.
[10:42:49] <_|Nix|_> jrburke: Do you know how I can get the text plugin to honour the path I've assigned to jQM?
[10:43:08] <_|Nix|_> jrburke: It keeps looking for version.txt in my project's subdirectories, rather than jQM's.
[10:44:55] <toddmparker> all - agenda = https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ghxI0QOcDmpDTh1x-V14PmzNz_Gn2y4sAkfum2d3_Dk/edit
[10:45:05] <jrburke> _|Nix|_: what is the title of the email?
[10:45:28] <_|Nix|_> jrburke: "Text plugin and paths"
[10:46:27] <jrburke> _|Nix|_: great, thanks. i should be getting to support email later today, need to finish something for a work deadline, so hopefully will get a response by end of day
[10:47:01] <_|Nix|_> jrburke: OK. Great! Thanks a lot!

[11:04:14] <gnarf> i believe you have them
[11:04:24] <gnarf>  /msg chanserv op #jquery-meeting
[11:05:10] <toddmparker> hmm, ok
[11:05:25] <toddmparker> guess so. didn't work last time i tried
[11:05:46] <gseguin> I'm opped but I can't change the mode
[11:05:51] <gnarf> then, /mode #jquery-meeting -m
[11:06:01] <gnarf> it won't show anything if the mode change has no effect
[11:06:24] <gnarf> +m / -m 
[11:06:48] <gseguin> toddmparker: I just tried that
[11:07:36] <gseguin> toddmparker: is it still not working?
[11:13:55] <gnarf> something strange happening with the mobile view
[11:15:06] <gnarf> the index.html is disappearing...
[11:15:19] <gnarf> for the /
[11:15:24] <gnarf> not sure whats causing that yet
[11:16:05] <gseguin> toddmparker: is it working now?
[11:17:17] <gseguin> toddmparker: I just checked and it's not moderated
[11:17:24] <gseguin> toddmparker: you should be good to go
[11:17:32] <gseguin> I've got to go
[11:29:39] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The question is whether we can pass a widget instance to $.widget so as to apply extensions per-instance rather than per-class. Can we?
[11:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> No, you can't do that.
[11:30:40] <scott_gonzalez> $.widget() is only for creating new constructors.
[11:31:07] <scott_gonzalez> Extending a single instance is generall a one-off.
[11:31:26] <scott_gonzalez> What's the use case you're trying to solve?
[11:31:34] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: When you do a $.widget( "ns.widgetname", $.ns.widgetname, someExtension ), does it add another layer through which one must pass to get to the actual member functions?
[11:32:06] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Like, if I call some private function, I've noticed that it goes through a wrapper in the widget factory.
[11:32:18] <scott_gonzalez> The wrapper is for _super().
[11:32:37] <scott_gonzalez> When you call $.widget() it always creates a new constructor and a new prototype.
[11:32:59] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Right. So, if I add multiple extensions, I'll have many prototypes which basically refer to one another.
[11:33:09] <scott_gonzalez> So $.widget( "ns.widgetname", $.ns.widgetname, someExtension ) replaces $.ns.widgetname and puts the old one in the prototype chain.
[11:33:15] <scott_gonzalez> correct
[11:33:28] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise _super() would be crazy.
[11:33:42] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Doesn't that make the chain of function calls longer as I want to reach any particular member function?
[11:34:00] <scott_gonzalez> no
[11:34:16] <scott_gonzalez> It makes the prototype chain longer, but not the number of function invocations.
[11:35:09] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: OK, that's good.
[11:37:02] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Thanks! That takes a load of worry off my shoulders.
[11:37:07] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[11:39:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so that means you can do what i was saying and just have an option right?
[11:40:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes. That's what's already happening.
[11:40:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Another interesting thing I noticed: If I use the same extension on two different widget classes, I need to copy it over: https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw/blob/1f9aa36de3c0401996b1781a3748906212bc8b19/js/widgets/color/colorpalette.js#L233
[11:40:41] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... otherwise it ends up calling the wrong _super().
[11:41:03] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: In that project, both colorpalette and hsvpicker use the colorWidget extension.
[11:41:19] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, I had to copy it with $.extend() before passing it to $.widget.
[11:41:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i thought you said you were overwriting classes justr by the extension existing?
[11:41:35] <arschmitz> maybe i misunderstood what you were saying
[11:41:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Currently, if you include the extension in your build, it will overwrite $.mobile.popup.
[11:42:14] <scott_gonzalez> hmm...
[11:42:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But scott_gonzalez just said that that does not add another level of indirection, so no performance impact.
[11:42:52] <scott_gonzalez> Which version of jQuery UI is this?
[11:42:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, I'm not worried about the fact that /all/ sliders will be created using the extended prototype rather than the original prototype.
[11:42:58] <arschmitz> ok i did missunderstnad i think you were talking about the widget as a class not a css class for the widget right?
[11:43:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes. The widget prototype.
[11:43:27] <arschmitz> i thought you were saying you were changing css classes used by the widget regardless of the option
[11:43:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm used to thinking in terms of class/instance (the C++ way).
[11:43:34] <arschmitz> and that would not be cool!
[11:43:41] <arschmitz> yeah i realized after sorry
[11:43:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: jQuery UI Widget v1.10.0pre - 2012-11-13 (ff055a0c353c3c8ce6e5bfa07ad7cb03e8885bc5)
[11:44:22] <arschmitz> we should really update that more often i think lol
[11:45:14] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Can you throw together a small test showing this problem?
[11:45:21] <scott_gonzalez> I'd like to get it fixed in the widget factory.
[11:45:32] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure why it's storing a reference like that.
[11:45:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Sure. I can file a bug against the widget factory.
[11:46:04] <scott_gonzalez> I actually copy all the properties into a proxiedPrototype then use that for the real prototype.
[11:46:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: For now, you can clone web-ui-fw and just take out the $.extend ...
[11:46:43] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... in fact, I'll do that now to make sure I wasn't hallucinating :)
[11:46:51] <scott_gonzalez> heh, ok
[11:48:09] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I wasn't hallucinating.
[11:52:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So ... hangout?
[11:57:19] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: let's plan on chatting tomorrow. I'm meeting with the core and UI guys in the morning and will have more news then.
[11:57:52] <toddmparker> in an nutshell, i think we should accelerate the ui + mobile merge and make some big changes
[11:59:10] <agcolom> toddmparker: message to Brad Lassey sent... Will let you know when I hear back from him.
[12:00:46] <toddmparker> thanks agcolom 
[12:04:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK.
[14:25:08] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The problem seems to be fixed in git.
[14:29:24] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: It was fixed in 1.10.1.
