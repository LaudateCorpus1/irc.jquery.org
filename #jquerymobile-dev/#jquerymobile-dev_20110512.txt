[07:21:30] <JohnResig> toddparker: maybe you're over here?
[10:02:14] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9243
[10:02:19] <ajpiano> seem like a mobile bug to anynoe else?
[10:14:20] <StevenBlack> ajpiano: yes, that smells like jQuery Mobile.
[10:14:58] <StevenBlack> ajpiano: ah, seeing the comments, it's closed.  Good.
[10:15:03] <ajpiano> yea i closed it and told .. yup :)
[10:27:14] <todd__> stevenblack - i looked into that firefox scrollbar issue
[10:27:15] <todd__> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1601
[10:27:32] <todd__> scottjehl - any idea why we need overflow-x: hidden in the styles?
[10:28:42] <StevenBlack> ?m1601
[10:28:44] <bot-t> [#1601] Scroll bar on listview in Firefox (open) - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1601
[10:29:56] <StevenBlack> Let me state: I'm usually fixing this problem in IE, not FF  :-)
[10:30:29] <StevenBlack> Worth checking: so many containers here, which one is scrollbar'ing?
[10:31:20] <todd__> the content div
[10:31:38] <todd__> it's like the stuff inside is a few px too tall always
[10:31:49] <StevenBlack> Ah!
[10:31:53] <todd__> i just sent that to scott to ask what the deal is with that style
[10:32:01] <todd__> firebug to the rescue
[10:32:31] <StevenBlack> Well, if overflow is hidden, that's when we get the scrollbar, right?
[10:32:41] <todd__> yeah
[10:32:44] <todd__> but it
[10:32:47] <todd__> it
[10:33:00] <todd__> it's the overflow-x property, not y
[10:33:10] <StevenBlack> nvm.  I was looking at overflow-x, reading it wrong as y.
[10:33:13] <todd__> unless firefox confuses these
[10:34:44] <todd__> ajpiano - issue 9243 is probably a user error, but maybe mobile
[10:34:55] <todd__> closing in core is good by me
[10:40:36] <ajpiano> yea it was really an adorable ticket
[10:40:50] <ajpiano> "That means it does not understand the jquery javascript library."
[10:40:53] <StevenBlack> I'm not able to reproduce the problem here on FF 4.01 but Firebug is telling me that ul.ui-listview has influence beyond the bounds of div.ui-content according to the various Firebug shadings.
[10:43:00] <StevenBlack> Wondering if setting "ui-content ui-listview { margin-bottom:0;}" fixes it in your PasteBin...
[10:43:22] <StevenBlack> Or clearfix the listview.
[10:44:35] <StevenBlack> Interesting to see if adding a footer helps, just for the sake of trying something.
[10:44:56] <StevenBlack> Like I said, I can't test these here right now since I don't have a failure case.
[10:46:40] <StevenBlack> Todd_: If you cannot see postings I made here from 1:30am, issue 1605 is a certifiable regression since A-4, and a blocker.

[10:47:50] <StevenBlack> Todd_: need you or someone to set the issue state on 1605.  Currently that's set to "open".  I haven't got rights to set issue labels.
[10:49:19] <StevenBlack> todd: ^^^ --- (not sure about user notification case sensitivity.)
[10:49:35] <StevenBlack> Aargh.  todd_: ^^^
[11:30:34] <toddparker> hey
[11:31:03] <toddparker> stevenblack - all set. it's a blocker assigned to kin now, thanks
[11:31:32] <toddparker> Joseph from glyphish.com has volunteered to create a special jQM glyphish icon sprite that people can use
[11:32:00] <toddparker> it'll be optional and separate but i hope to wire the styles up thru the data-icon mechansim
[11:34:37] <toddparker> just pulled in #1602
[11:34:45] <toddparker> Thanks stevenblack
[11:34:46] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1602
[11:36:38] <toddparker> Hey all, Ghislain Séguin from Jive Software is going to be helping out on mobile so if you see him around here say "Hi!"
[11:37:07] <toddparker> jseguin_ - I see you now. Hello and welcome!
[11:37:29] <toddparker> gseguin_ - sorry can't type right now
[11:37:44] <gseguin_> Hey Todd
[11:37:53] <toddparker> Hi there.
[11:38:00] <gseguin_> Thanks
[11:38:16] <toddparker> So how much work have you done on mobile so far? Have you used it on projects?
[11:38:51] <gseguin_> no work really, played with the dojox.mobile project
[11:40:18] <toddparker> well, you've got a lot of code to read up on then!
[11:40:25] <gseguin_> I know!
[11:40:41] <gseguin_> I've started
[11:40:45] <toddparker> we do a lot of progressive enhancement so actually buidling basic pages is super easy with html
[11:40:55] <toddparker> but there's a lof o coding magic to make that happen
[11:41:07] <toddparker> what test devices do you have?
[11:41:29] <gseguin_> My personal device is a Samsung Galaxy S
[11:41:54] <gseguin_> but at the office we have pretty much all of them
[11:43:32] <toddparker> cool
[11:43:56] <toddparker> actually, we have a wiki page that you should add the key devices on so we can track down someone to test certain issues
[11:43:57] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Test-devices
[11:44:14] <toddparker> _nickel (John Bender) - can you also add you test devices here
[11:44:39] <toddparker> stevenblack, eddiemonge, etc. please add your devices here too when you can
[11:47:11] <gseguin_> done
[11:47:28] <gseguin_> I'll gather the list of devices we have here and will put them up
[11:48:16] <StevenBlack> gseguin: français?
[11:48:48] <gseguin_> yep
[11:49:09] <gseguin_> Darn! I got betrayed by my handle
[11:49:35] <StevenBlack> It was the accent in Todd's intro.
[11:51:03] <gseguin_> where did you find the ç ?
[11:51:14] <gseguin_> do you have an azerty keyboard?
[11:51:19] <StevenBlack> On OS-x, option+c
[11:51:28] <gseguin_> yeah that works too
[11:52:26] <StevenBlack> gseguin: France, Belgium, or Québec?
[11:52:44] <gseguin_> StevenBlack: France
[11:52:45] <toddparker> I can never find those accented characters (except on iPhone) so forgive me if I murderize your name
[11:52:56] <gseguin_> oh no worries
[11:53:06] <toddparker> steven, you're canadian right?
[11:53:06] <gseguin_> I go by G in everyday life
[11:53:15] <toddparker> G is easy, like it
[11:53:36] <StevenBlack> toddparker: Right.  Quebec City originally.  Ontario now.
[11:54:29] <gseguin_> StevenBlack: Quebec, you speak french then?
[11:55:11] <StevenBlack> Oui.  J'usqua l'age de 17-ans dans un cycle français.
[11:56:11] * StevenBlack wonders if Filament Group gets discounts on mobile devices.
[11:57:56] <toddparker> we got some free ones from RIM and Plam
[11:58:05] <toddparker> The project bought a bunch at the start
[11:58:13] <toddparker> and we've been suppliementing recently
[11:58:43] <toddparker> we bought a nook, kindle, HTC Aria (2.1) recently but most were free to us :)
[12:00:14] <StevenBlack> OBTW, wanna draw your attention to a great practice we should encourage: @jasonparallel has a repo for sharing files and screenshots of the issues he discovers.  That oughta be encouraged across the user base.  https://github.com/jasonparallel/JQM-Issues and see issue 1601.

[12:13:07] <bot-t> [#1612] listview: Allow tall list items to optionally disable automatic positioning of their image (open) - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1612
[12:22:03] <toddparker> stevenblack - i sort of like jsbin or js fiddle because i can more easily test, edit and share changes but it's a personal pref i guess
[12:22:22] <toddparker> git is probably better for muli page sites
[12:24:54] <StevenBlack> Right.  As in before and after to demonstrate a regression, as in this case.  I think it's a cool way to convey more complex issues.  In this case I was able to test alternates like jquery 1.6 without mucking with the pastebin/fiddle.
[12:25:32] <toddparker> yeah, sure
[12:25:47] <toddparker> ok, guys i'm jumping off for a while. talk to you later
[12:29:52] <gseguin_> same here

[22:53:01] <StevenBlack> ?tell eddiemonge Hi Eddie, can we put a 'make: <dateTime>' comment in the js and min.js files created by the make process?  As releases get progressively staler, we need to tell if a bug report is referencing the products of a recent make.  Sensible?
