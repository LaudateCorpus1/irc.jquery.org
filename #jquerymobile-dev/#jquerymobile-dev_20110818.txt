[06:34:14] <scottjehl> morning
[07:17:53] <scottjehl_> test
[08:33:53] <rwaldron> scottjehl toddmparker do you have any sort of documentation for jqmobile themes?
[08:34:18] <rwaldron> our client has UI elements that don't fit with the current themes
[09:03:58] <gseguin> Good morning all
[09:16:45] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[09:16:52] <gseguin> yes sir
[09:17:06] <toddparker> rwaldron - there is an overview of theming in the docs
[09:17:18] <toddparker> i'm here if you have q's
[09:17:25] <rwaldron> ok, all set for now
[09:17:32] <rwaldron> i'll ping if i have Qs
[09:17:34] <rwaldron> thanks dude
[09:17:46] <toddparker> but you basically can apply the theme-bar/body/btn-a/b/c/d/e
[09:18:48] <gseguin> toddparker: question was around that commit: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a620d97868844f8f5b0721bc07d24f415d66ed1c
[09:19:34] <gseguin> the create flag was not being sent to refresh at create time
[09:19:51] <gseguin> and I was wondering if you had any idea why
[09:21:24] <_nickel> gseguin: scottjehl: kinblas: I think I have a relatively simple solution to our state managment issues in our test suite
[09:21:37] <_nickel> mind you this is a problem for virtually anyone who's doing js tests
[09:21:52] <kinblas> ??
[09:22:20] * gseguin listens
[09:22:31] <_nickel> so
[09:22:35] <_nickel> first
[09:22:46] <_nickel> I'm going to say this will seem obvious once I say it out loud
[09:22:57] <_nickel> so try not to laugh
[09:23:34] * gseguin keeps mouth flat
[09:24:01] <_nickel> anyway
[09:24:07] <_nickel> the vast majority of the issues we have
[09:24:15] <_nickel> are purely based on state before / after tests
[09:24:19] <_nickel> like 90%
[09:24:26] <_nickel> eg
[09:24:40] <_nickel> were on this page but the tests expect to be on the originally loaded page
[09:24:43] <_nickel> so we need to reset
[09:24:52] <_nickel> can't find the button
[09:24:53] <_nickel> fail
[09:25:17] <_nickel> this is most obvious in the nav test suite because there's no facility in qunit
[09:25:27] <_nickel> for manageing the hash
[09:25:37] <_nickel> no other test suite library has anything like that either
[09:25:50] <_nickel> from what I can tell qunit is one of the few that manages the dom for you :P
[09:25:53] <_nickel> anyway
[09:26:00] <_nickel> STATE
[09:26:11] <_nickel> as engineers we all know that it is the enemy
[09:26:14] <_nickel> so
[09:26:33] <_nickel> we could go around manually cleaning that crap up
[09:26:38] <_nickel> or build something into qunit to watch each of those
[09:26:42] <_nickel> both lame
[09:27:16] <_nickel> easiest thing to do is intercept test creation and run each individual test inside its parent page in a new iframe
[09:27:21] <_nickel> each test gets an iframe
[09:28:21] <_nickel> we're already running the whole test suite inside an iframe
[09:28:28] <_nickel> so we know that the tests work that way
[09:28:38] <_nickel> additionally this allows us to run the tests in parallel if we want
[09:28:58] <_nickel> anyway
[09:28:59] <_nickel> thats the idea
[09:29:15] <_nickel> once I get the navigation tests for replaceState sorted and the last bugs figured out
[09:32:15] * _nickel takes the silence here as implicit agreement with his ideas 
[09:32:28] <gseguin> it's worth a try
[09:32:59] <_nickel> I'm pretty sure it will work
[09:33:24] <_nickel> the only question is if I can do it without monkeying with qunit
[09:34:07] <gseguin> or work with Jörn
[09:34:19] <_nickel> gseguin: yah if I need to I will
[09:34:24] <_nickel> once I get it working I'll talk with him
[09:50:45] <checker> hello
[09:51:00] <checker> can someone help me with a little problem?
[09:53:18] <_nickel> kinblas: just saw your email
[09:53:24] <_nickel> tests are win
[09:54:00] <_nickel> \\
[10:00:40] <kinblas> _nickel: which email ... I've been firing off quite a few this morning
[10:00:42] * kinblas sighs
[10:00:51] <_nickel> on the vendor prefixes
[10:00:59] <kinblas> oh
[10:01:12] * kinblas notes Outlook has been his IDE lately
[10:03:44] <_nickel> :(
[10:03:48] <_nickel> enormous frowny face
[10:34:41] <scottjehl> hey
[10:44:08] <kinblas> scottjehl: hey
[11:01:34] <toddparker> starting the meeting
[11:04:04] <gseguin> _nickel: meeting?
[11:08:46] <peol> oh, sure
[11:10:26] <gseguin> peol: thanks!
[11:10:32] <peol> hehe np
[11:52:25] <kinblas> man IRC is not a good medium for meetings :-)
[12:13:19] <toddparker> i know
[12:13:20] <toddparker> hate it
[12:13:46] <kinblas> toddparker: someone reading *after the fact* ... it looks like a big mess
[12:13:54] <kinblas> folks on different topics talking over each other
[12:14:17] <kinblas> ... reading after the fact , you can't appreciate the awkward pauses that contribute to the confusion
[12:14:35] <toddparker> heh
[12:14:51] <toddparker> yeah, we could think about doing a skype call
[12:15:00] <kinblas> scottjehl: _nickl: so I had a question regarding that URL bug you guys were talking about?
[12:15:07] <toddparker> i'm ok saying the format is too hard
[12:15:12] <kinblas> heh
[12:15:18] <scottjehl> kinblas go
[12:15:35] <kinblas> so what is the problem?
[12:15:38] <kinblas> we have something like
[12:15:51] <kinblas> http://foo.com/#/bar/something/else.html
[12:15:58] <kinblas> and the push state code is transforming it to
[12:16:02] <kinblas> http://foo.com/?
[12:20:22] <scottjehl> shouldn't no
[12:20:27] <scottjehl> if it is, that's a bug
[12:20:35] <scottjehl> it should go to http://foo.com/bar/something/else.html
[12:21:31] <scottjehl> this page demonstrates: http://filamentgroup.com/examples/pushstate/#/examples/pushstate/docs/toolbars/index.html
[12:22:02] <kinblas> scottjehl: oh I get what it should be ... I'm asking what the bug is you guys were going back and forth about?
[12:22:12] <kinblas> the chrome bug I was mentioning
[12:22:17] <kinblas> had to do with some testing I did
[12:22:26] <kinblas> regarding another issue related to history
[12:22:28] <scottjehl> ah. yeah _nickel brought it up
[12:22:32] <scottjehl> haven't seen it
[12:22:37] <kinblas> the bug I was talking about is this
[12:22:50] <kinblas> *ALL* of the browsers treat the setting of location.hash differently
[12:22:57] <kinblas> *BEFORE* the onload fires
[12:23:06] <_nickel> my office mates are stepping out for lunch
[12:23:09] <kinblas> in chrome, you can set location.hash 10 times
[12:23:19] <kinblas> and you won't necessarily get 10 history entries
[12:23:24] <_nickel> can I read when I get back or do you need my input?
[12:23:32] <kinblas> _nickel: sure, nothing pressing
[12:23:43] <_nickel> kinblas: thanks much
[12:24:20] <kinblas> anyways, I thought that's where you guys were going ... but then your discussion went in a different direction talking about URLs
[12:25:29] <scottjehl> heh. ok
[12:27:10] <kinblas> scottjehl: anyways I'm still interested in what you guys were talking about .. .I just need to understand what the actual problem was
[12:27:17] <kinblas> guess we'll pick up when _nickel gets back.
[12:27:27] * kinblas goes to grab a bite to eat
[12:29:54] <scottjehl> I'll be back on later
[12:30:11] <scottjehl> for extensibility hook... I think there are a few ways we could do it
[12:31:22] <scottjehl> 1) use triggerHandler to trigger an event, say, "pagedataresponse", that you could bind to, access the ajax response data in the callback function, and return whatever templated data you want
[12:32:14] <scottjehl> 2) do the same thing, but with a $.mobile.foo method. Where one could just override $.mobile.filterPageResponse = function( data ) { return templater( data ); };
[12:33:12] <scottjehl> 3) just use jQuery's ajax configuration that's already there. Like...
[12:34:04] <scottjehl> $.ajaxSetup({
[12:34:04] <scottjehl>    dataFilter: function(data, type){
[12:34:04] <scottjehl> 	 return myTemplateEngine( data );
[12:34:05] <scottjehl>    }
[12:34:05] <scottjehl> });
[12:34:11] <scottjehl> Note that #3 already works
[12:34:38] <scottjehl> but it's not restricted to just jQM ajax requests. It affects all jQuery ajax requests. For most folks, that may be fine
[12:34:46] <scottjehl> anyway, gotta run. back in a few!
[12:37:43] <miketaylr> hmm webos seems like it just got axed
[12:40:25] <peol> yeah :/
[12:40:56] <peol> techcrunch mentions "On the upside, webOS itself isn’t dead — at least, not just yet. HP’s wording up above leaves things a bit vague, with at least two potential routes left open: licensing webOS to others, and sticking webOS in other, non-phone/tablet devices (HP has already mentioned plans to put it in printers and cars.) " though
[12:41:28] <peol> but it's definitely not looking good :)
[12:44:01] <miketaylr> ahh
[13:43:28] <_nickel> kinblas: scottjehl: back
[13:54:16] <todd__> big news on webOS
[13:54:20] <todd__> that is sort of sad
[13:54:25] <todd__> i really like that os
[13:54:33] <todd__> better than android for sure
[13:54:37] <gseguin> yep
[13:54:54] <todd__> so kinblas - i pasted scott's comments on extensibility on this issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1872
[13:54:57] <todd__> is that the right one?
[13:54:57] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1872 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1m, 3w ago): Add extensibility hooks to allow for dynamic page creation and mgmt
[13:55:06] <todd__> don't want to lose stuff on IRC
[13:58:04] <kinblas> todd_: on that page referenced in the bug ... there is a section about URL Hooks
[13:58:09] <kinblas> and mentions Jive
[13:58:19] <_nickel> scottjehl: let me know when you have a second
[13:59:04] <kinblas> todd_: yeah, it's as good as any I guess
[13:59:30] <kinblas> todd_: though the title of the bug is a bit generic
[13:59:53] <kinblas> now that it is assigned and marked B3 it will be easy to find anyways
[14:05:37] <_nickel> todd__: if you see scott around let him know I have replacestate questioni
[14:05:40] <_nickel> *question
[14:06:46] <kinblas> _nickel: scottjehl: gseguin: So are folks ok with me changing the Vendor prefixes to leading upper-case in the support.js?
[14:07:00] <_nickel> no skin off my know
[14:08:28] <_nickel> nose
[14:08:34] * _nickel just caught his error
[14:18:36] <gseguin> kinblas: the way you explained it in the email, right?
[14:19:19] <gseguin> with the empty string first element
[15:10:45] <todd__> think that's fine
[15:11:01] <todd__> btw scottjehl is getting an armful of immunzations
[15:11:12] <_nickel> ah
[15:13:37] <todd__> feel like we should respond to steve: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2283
[15:13:38] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2283 on jquery-mobile, reported by SteveSanderson (3d, 7h ago): Ajax navigation breaks navigation to non-jQuery-Mobile pages
[15:13:42] <todd__> just don't know what to say
[15:14:11] <_nickel> thats the aspnet team?
[15:14:14] <todd__> what he's asking for seems too magical
[15:14:20] <todd__> ya
[15:14:21] <_nickel> its not that magical
[15:14:28] <_nickel> but two requests is silly
[15:14:36] <_nickel> lets ask for the mechanics of why he can't know ahead of time
[15:14:41] <_nickel> that is bizarre to me
[15:14:45] <todd__> i know
[15:16:11] <todd__> ok, i commented and asked for info
[15:16:14] <todd__> thanks guys
[15:16:30] <todd__> i gotta head out but will be working on jQM stuff tomorrow
[15:16:37] <todd__> bye!
[15:37:04] <_nickel> sweet
[15:37:07] <_nickel> nav tests are passing
[16:45:15] <kinblas> _nickel: doh, I didn't see that you and todd already discussed on IRC
[16:45:39] <kinblas> in any case, it is an overhead that you want to try and do without
[18:37:47] <scottjehl> _nickel - that's awesome! nice work. I wonder how we should begin to roll this one out...
[18:38:08] <scottjehl> _nickel I'm going to pull the branch down to test it out
[19:45:22] <scottjehl> _nickel k I followed up with a small change based on your earlier commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/b438472fec689ddd1fdcfc751e76e459dbf4d574
[19:45:23] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by scottjehl (4m, 10s ago): if no hash is present, run a replacestate. All nav tests still passing.
[19:45:48] <_nickel> nice
[19:46:11] <_nickel> scottjehl: we can't really test the issue I was seeing
[19:46:41] <_nickel> scottjehl: you can try it by visiting http://33.33.33.10/#/docs/toolbars/index.html
[19:46:47] <_nickel> where the domain is your localhost
[19:47:05] <_nickel> otherwise you'll get the DoD lol
[19:48:13] <_nickel> scottjehl: appears to be working
[19:48:25] <_nickel> scottjehl: what did that trigger accomplish?
[19:52:29] <scottjehl> hey sorry
[19:52:38] <scottjehl> ok so if you go to the docs homepage
[19:52:48] <scottjehl> then click somewhere
[19:52:51] <scottjehl> then click back
[19:53:07] <scottjehl> the url would change, but the content would stay
[19:53:36] <scottjehl> that's because popstate didn't fire between the two urls. The first didn't have a state to pop
[19:53:40] <scottjehl> this fixes that
[19:54:27] <scottjehl> man, I love that we've managed to make this work from an external file. So clean :)
[19:54:49] <scottjehl> great work on the tests btw
[19:57:35] <scottjehl> _nickel I updated this too, if you clear cache http://filamentgroup.com/examples/pushstate/
[19:58:04] <_nickel> scottjehl: cool
[19:58:08] <_nickel> scottjehl: I rebased and took a look
[19:58:17] <_nickel> the tests are almost finished
[19:58:53] <_nickel> I have to devise a nie way to force them into "hash mode" on push state browsers that also works with our test suite runner
[19:58:56] <_nickel> OH!
[19:59:07] <_nickel> scottjehl: and you missed my solution to our browser state problems during testing
[19:59:26] <_nickel> I'm going to hack together a test runner that puts each test into a new instance of the page
[19:59:32] <_nickel> inside an iframe
[19:59:47] <_nickel> so it will be well and truely reset after each test
[20:00:22] <scottjehl> oh okay. that's great
[20:01:02] <scottjehl> seems maybe intensive for devices to run the tests that way... do you think it'll be okay?
[20:03:46] <_nickel> scottjehl: well what do you mean intensive?
[20:04:03] <_nickel> I'm going to find a way to turn that off
[20:04:14] <_nickel> but intensive or otherwise we're really aiming for correctness
[20:04:20] <_nickel> in testing that is
[20:04:41] <scottjehl> yeah
[20:05:54] <_nickel> going to play around with that now
[20:06:02] <_nickel> this is a serious issue for all javascript testing
[20:06:11] <_nickel> the frameworks I know of suck at this
[20:06:29] <_nickel> and as applications become singple page focused its going to be extremely important
[20:06:53] <_nickel> scottjehl: it also lets you run your tests in parallel if you want to since they're isolated inside an iframe
[20:07:23] <_nickel> scottjehl: at least on the desktop we could speed things up quite a bit
[20:07:26] <_nickel> AND
[20:07:34] <_nickel> we could view the pages while they're running for debugging purposes
[20:08:05] <_nickel> just have to watch out that we don't end up at inception levels :P
[20:10:21] <scottjehl> :)
[20:10:32] <scottjehl> so happy to see this moving along
[20:11:08] <scottjehl> this is what, the 6th fresh rewrite  of a pushstate implementation? This was crazy hard to get right.
[20:11:30] <scottjehl> replacestate is a great feature
[20:41:10] <scottjehl> _nickel someone found an interesting bug. I may have just introduced it, not sure. Load homepage, click somewhere, hit refresh, then hit back. Goes nowhere.
[20:41:33] <_nickel> yay bug finding people
[20:41:57] <_nickel> so the replace state adds a history entry before the current one?
[20:42:10] <_nickel> there's shouldn't be a back button on refresh
[20:42:13] <scottjehl> yeah. I like tweeting stuff just when we need to punch holes
[20:42:23] <scottjehl> there shouldn't?
[20:42:37] <scottjehl> I wonder if we could avoid the initial replacestate and handle it another way... like if the popstate from the page you're leaving could get us that event we need
[20:42:38] <scottjehl> hmm
[20:48:09] <scottjehl> yeah that change I just made definitely borked the back button in this scenario
[20:48:24] <scottjehl> but of course, removing it doesn't help either. hmmmm
[21:09:01] <scottjehl> _nickel heading out for the night. thanks!
[21:09:11] <_nickel> scottjehl: thank you sir!
