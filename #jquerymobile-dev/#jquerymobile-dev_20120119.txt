[08:53:22] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:58:04] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[08:58:11] <toddparker> morning all
[08:58:24] <gseguin> 'sup toddparker ?
[08:59:04] <rwaldron> toddparker yt?
[09:00:01] <rwaldron> I was test driving the lastest master on this client app and $.mobile.fixedToolbars is gone, is there an issue i can read to get caught up on that?
[09:01:45] <gseguin> what do you mean it
[09:01:47] <gseguin> s gone?
[09:02:02] * gseguin really need that return key somewhere else
[09:02:32] <gseguin> rwaldron: ^
[09:02:56] <rwaldron> gseguin one sec dude
[09:03:08] <rwaldron> (sorry, I'm at the client's office)
[09:03:16] <rwaldron> :\
[09:03:18] <gseguin> no worries
[09:36:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/DRL0jg
[09:36:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Update to buttonMarkup to use appropriate data selector - Josh Dean
[09:36:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added test for issue #3141 - Josh Dean
[09:40:16] <imjoshdean> yay, I helped.
[09:40:55] <gseguin> thanks imjoshdean
[09:41:10] <johnbender> toddparker: we are not testing with both libraries
[09:41:11] <bot-t> (14 hours 30 mins ago) <rwaldron> tell johnbender dig it: https://github.com/rwldrn/jquery-mobile-badge/commit/3815236f19907853cf2cacdafe24c179349f89a6
[09:41:12] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile-badge by rwldrn (14h, 33m ago): detatch() original node and reuse - instead of clone and remove
[09:41:21] <gseguin> I split your commit
[09:41:22] <johnbender> toddparker: that's something that I realized when you asked
[09:41:37] <johnbender> rwaldron: nice!
[09:42:55] <toddparker> hey johnbender - so is there a way to test on both?
[09:43:07] <toddparker> i've a got a feeling that we'll see issues on 1.6.4
[09:43:18] <toddparker> or at least it's hard to know
[09:43:48] <toddparker> also, once all the 1.0.1 stuff if chicory picked over, I need to do a full run through of that branch not eh devices to see if everything is still ok
[09:45:55] <toddparker> hey gseguin and johnbender (or eddiemonge) - any info on /test/ still being stale?
[09:46:00] <johnbender> toddparker: we can definitely figure out a way
[09:46:16] <johnbender> toddparker: yes I know what the issue is
[09:46:23] <johnbender> I was going to work on test today
[09:46:28] <rwaldron> Hey guys, back for a sec... I mentioned this to gseguin about 30 mins ago
[09:46:28] <eddiemonge> toddparker: is it?
[09:46:29] <rwaldron> http://gyazo.com/5ca779761e07a433416a2a720fc12726
[09:46:32] <rwaldron> thats in master
[09:46:49] <johnbender> eddiemonge: the build takes too long and I think the request is timing out and killing the shell exec
[09:46:59] <rwaldron> maybe intentionally?
[09:47:10] <rwaldron> brb
[09:47:17] <johnbender> rwaldron: ask toddparker
[09:47:33] <eddiemonge> johnbender: is it that things in cdn/demos are not being updated? is cdn/jqm.js not updated as well?
[09:47:38] <rwaldron> toddparker are there any docs regarding $.mobile.fixedToolbars being missing from master?
[09:47:44] <johnbender> eddiemonge: the build is dying half way  through
[09:47:54] <johnbender> eddiemonge: the actual build
[09:47:58] <johnbender> which means the files aren't updated
[09:48:28] <rwaldron> sorry, brb again
[09:48:52] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'm going to move the build stuff out to a bash script and then we can just fork that
[09:49:18] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'll submit a pr for your review when I get it working
[09:49:21] <toddparker> rwaldron: I need to update the fixed docs in master now that the new fixed style has landed
[09:49:40] <rwaldron> can you give me the "gist"
[09:49:53] <rwaldron> I'm guessing there is no reason to even call those methods anymore?
[09:50:03] <toddparker> nope
[09:50:04] <johnbender> eddiemonge: sound good?
[09:50:15] <eddiemonge> johnbender: it looks like its java dying.: Error occurred during initialization of VM  [5] => Could not reserve enough space for object heap
[09:50:15] <toddparker> if you have the fixed attar on them, it should just work
[09:50:20] <toddparker> but better than before
[09:50:24] <rwaldron> toddparker beautiful
[09:50:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: that's not always the case
[09:50:35] <rwaldron> i will assign no-ops for the time being
[09:50:38] <johnbender> eddiemonge: the last couple appear to be dying part way through
[09:50:39] <toddparker> that plugin is totally new. the old was has been deleted
[09:50:43] <rwaldron> thanks for the heads up
[09:50:45] <rwaldron> appreciated
[09:50:48] <rwaldron> lunch time!
[09:50:51] <toddparker> it still has the tap to hide, but its' true fixed
[09:50:57] <toddparker> at least on ios5
[09:51:09] <toddparker> ios4 falls back to just scrolling with the doc
[09:51:11] <toddparker> fyi
[09:51:12] <johnbender> eddiemonge: either way we should probably fork the shell exec anyhow
[09:51:14] <eddiemonge> johnbender: because of that. i wonder if there also isnt a race condition when two are started at the same time
[09:51:48] <eddiemonge> johnbender: from jqmcom repo?
[09:51:59] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah I forked the repo and I'll send you a pr?
[09:52:02] <gseguin> oh wow! IRCCloud is a mess!
[09:52:03] <johnbender> if that's alright
[09:52:10] <johnbender> gseguin: irssi imo
[09:52:12] <johnbender> :D
[09:52:13] <johnbender> well
[09:52:14] <eddiemonge> johnbender: ok
[09:52:15] <rwaldron> dudes, well done... this works great. ok, for real lunch now
[09:52:15] <johnbender> +proxy
[09:52:16] <gseguin> hey johnbender!
[09:52:21] <johnbender> which I have yet to set up
[09:52:50] <gseguin> once you've set it up let me know
[09:53:11] <gseguin> johnbender: did you see ? tests are green
[09:53:13] <bot-t> johnbender, QUnit - QUnit is a powerful, easy-to-use, JavaScript test suite. It's used by the jQuery project to test its code and plugins but is capable of testing any generic JavaScript code (and even capable of test... http://docs.jquery.com/QUnit
[09:53:38] <johnbender> gseguin: some day lol
[09:53:42] <gseguin> thanks bot-t, very useful
[09:53:46] <johnbender> gseguin: I did
[09:53:59] <johnbender> did you get in a fix for the page sections issue?
[09:54:43] <gseguin> yeah: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/e4453aceb406f147b897d21799e7a48af696408d
[09:54:44] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (10h, 42m ago): Save the fixture after the enhancement, then start
[09:54:56] <gseguin> this one is AMD's fault
[09:55:22] <johnbender> ah
[09:55:23] <johnbender> nice
[09:55:24] <gseguin> I mean kindda
[09:55:30] <johnbender> that, is actually generally very useful
[09:55:42] <imjoshdean> damn irccloud...
[09:56:09] <gseguin> but basically it was saving the non-enhanced markeup in the fixture
[10:07:49] <gseguin> man github is so slow this morning
[10:22:15] <toddparker> hey
[10:28:04] <gseguin> toddparker: any specific you want me to focus on today
[10:28:14] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[10:28:14] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-1.0-stable build #16: FIXED in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-1.0-stable/16/
[10:28:20] <gseguin> or just going down the issues?
[10:30:11] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #412: SUCCESS in 16 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/412/
[10:30:11] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Update to buttonMarkup to use appropriate data selector
[10:30:12] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * ghislain: Added test for issue #3141
[10:41:38] <johnbender> eddiemonge: what does the add method do in the gitpostcommit.php
[10:45:33] <eddiemonge> johnbender: i think its the logger
[10:46:25] <eddiemonge> or not
[10:46:49] <eddiemonge> it just takes the strings output by the shell and converts them to arrays with each line being a new entry
[10:57:53] <gseguin_> https://talkgadget.google.com/hangouts/extras/talk.google.com/jquerymobile-meeting?authuser=0&hl=en&eid=
[10:59:28] <toddparker> thanks gseguin
[11:01:53] <johnbender> eddiemonge: thanks
[11:02:18] <gseguin_> toddparker: are you joining?
[11:02:36] <toddparker> err, i'm there but the room is empty
[11:55:38] <gseguin> the internet is broken today
[12:09:15] <eddiemonge> johnbender: do you know perl?
[12:10:42] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I've used it but it's been a long time
[12:10:44] <johnbender> my first job
[12:10:48] <johnbender> eddiemonge: brb
[12:10:50] <johnbender> lunch
[12:55:40] <johnbender> eddiemonge: struggling to find a way to cast/fork the shell call in the php script do you know how to do that?
[12:56:16] <gseguin> if you have node on that machine why don't you use it to handle your post_receive hook?
[12:56:27] * gseguin ducks
[12:58:16] <gseguin> johnbender: in all seriousness, what else is that http server doing?
[12:58:40] <gseguin> is its sole purpose to handle github's post_receive hook?
[12:59:49] <johnbender> gseguin: no it serves other sites
[13:00:37] <johnbender> gseguin: and I lol'd at your suggestion + duck
[13:00:46] <johnbender> I'm basically done with the bash script replacement
[13:00:58] <johnbender> just need to make sure I can cast a slow running shell script off and return
[13:02:23] <gseguin> ok
[13:02:53] <johnbender> gseguin: eddiemonge is right though we should probably deal with the possibility that this thing is called twice
[13:02:56] * johnbender sighs
[13:04:43] <gseguin> hmm
[13:05:03] <gseguin> yeah that would be good
[13:06:48] <johnbender> gseguin: actually I'm going to deal with the current issue
[13:06:55] <johnbender> and then I'll deal with that one after
[13:07:04] <johnbender> having it work, at all is the priority
[13:07:08] <gseguin> sounds like a plan
[13:19:27] <eddiemonge> that server also runs testswarm so im thinking java really is running out of memory or locking up or something
[13:32:45] <toddparker> the swarm, aaargh!
[13:45:02] <eddiemonge> theres something wrong with the "latest" target build in the makefile. its copying all the files to the demo folder. looking into it
[13:45:24] <gseguin> eddiemonge: that's normal
[13:45:40] <gseguin> it's the way r.js does whole project optimization
[13:45:59] <gseguin> it copies html files to a dist dir
[13:46:04] <eddiemonge> it shouldnt. i mean it copies everything, not just the docs
[13:46:23] <gseguin> and processes the resource files
[13:46:28] <eddiemonge> the license, the makefile, everything
[13:46:41] <gseguin> there is an exclusion regexp in the docs.build.js file
[13:46:51] <gseguin> but that excludes only directories
[13:47:08] <gseguin> we missed jrburke, darn!
[13:47:26] <gseguin> I know it copies all these files
[13:47:34] <gseguin> it's not a bug, it's a feature
[13:50:25] <eddiemonge> no, its a bug. everything is getting copied into the output folder. the zips are wrong too
[13:51:19] <gseguin> eddiemonge: it's the way r.js works
[13:52:29] <gseguin> the other way is to copy the docs with a cp and generate each of the compiled resources with a different r.js call
[13:53:48] <gseguin> johnbender: any objection to rename jquery.js to jquery-<version>.js
[13:55:33] <gseguin> s/rename/renaming/
[13:59:57] <gseguin> scratch that
[14:14:41] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I submitted the pull request
[14:15:00] <johnbender> eddiemonge: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/pull/3
[14:15:01] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no pull request found
[14:16:11] <gseguin> johnbender: I think I got something working for the jquery switcher
[14:16:20] <gseguin> I'll create a PR for you to review
[14:16:22] <johnbender> gseguin: pr?
[14:16:23] <johnbender> yay!
[14:16:29] * johnbender loves pull requests
[14:16:40] <gseguin> just for the button test right now
[14:17:06] <johnbender> gseguin: thats fine, as long as its tied to a param we can just run the whole suite twice with whatever version we want
[14:17:14] <johnbender> that's pretty trivial from ci setup perspective
[14:17:19] <gseguin> yep
[14:17:42] <johnbender> now THIS is why you have a ci
[14:17:49] <johnbender> expecting people to do this kind of thing would be stupid
[14:17:55] <jzaefferer> hey guys
[14:18:02] <johnbender> jzaefferer: heyo!
[14:18:04] <jzaefferer> so johnbender, regarding yesterdays question
[14:18:08] <johnbender> yessir
[14:18:10] <johnbender> total curiousity
[14:18:16] <jzaefferer> jquerymobile.com and swarm.jquery.com happen to be on the same server
[14:18:23] <johnbender> s/ousi/osi/
[14:18:27] <jzaefferer> so "both" host that jenkins instance
[14:18:27] <johnbender> correct
[14:18:38] <jzaefferer> which isn't a slave
[14:18:42] <jzaefferer> we've got just that one
[14:18:45] <johnbender> kk
[14:18:49] <johnbender> good to know
[14:19:05] <jzaefferer> and one of these days we'd like to expand that to be the one CI instance of all the various jQuery projects
[14:19:11] <johnbender> I don't really know much about jenkins slaves so I thought if that's how you had it setup it would be super cool to learn about
[14:19:19] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah we definitely should
[14:19:34] <jzaefferer> we've got browserstack kind of integrated, so that TestSwarm gets, in theory, a 100% coverage whenever we need it
[14:19:39] <johnbender> the only reason ours is inside adobe is that it was the fastest way to set it up
[14:19:59] <johnbender> it was previously running on my last companies CI
[14:20:08] <johnbender> *company's
[14:20:16] <jzaefferer> so, the browserstack integration is there, and while there are a few quirks to work out, I hope we can put our focus in this one instance
[14:20:31] <jzaefferer> if that means porting your jobs to this instance, that shouldn't be a problem
[14:20:35] <johnbender> jzaefferer: surely can, just a matter of effort and time
[14:20:50] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah, the crappy part about that is the current ruby dep
[14:20:54] <jzaefferer> and we can also move jenkins to its own server, danheberden is the man for that
[14:21:17] <jzaefferer> whatever, that server already has apache, java and nodejs installed, can just install ruby as well :p
[14:21:21] <johnbender> not that I mind installing ruby, just not sure how the infra guys will feel about that
[14:21:25] <johnbender> cool
[14:21:29] <johnbender> hah
[14:21:36] <jzaefferer> to get the consolidation started, that should be fine
[14:21:48] <johnbender> super cool
[14:21:50] <jzaefferer> from there we can see about moving mobile to testswarm eventually
[14:21:55] <johnbender> ahh
[14:21:59] <johnbender> I dream of getting that done
[14:22:17] <jzaefferer> I can get you access to the box and Jenkins
[14:22:21] <johnbender> toddparker was talking about prioritizing that for post 1.2 maybe
[14:22:25] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I'm already there
[14:22:34] <johnbender> I'm helping eddie out with jqm.com
[14:22:40] <jzaefferer> ah, nice
[14:22:53] <johnbender> I'm in yur servers, hacking teh bash scrizzles
[14:22:59] * johnbender is mixing many memes
[14:23:12] <jzaefferer> so, via some other channel I talked to Todd about some of this as well, maybe we can give this a bit more attention soon
[14:23:32] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah we should try and do that call that Todd proposed when you guys can
[14:23:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin created jquery-version-selector (+4 new commits): http://git.io/obsywQ
[14:23:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/jquery-version-selector] Added jQuery 1.6.4 - Ghislain Seguin
[14:23:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/jquery-version-selector] Added jQuery 1.7.1 - Ghislain Seguin
[14:23:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/jquery-version-selector] Added a script tag inserter to be able to pick jQuery with a url param - Ghislain Seguin
[14:24:03] <jzaefferer> what I'm basically hoping for is this: by sharing an instance, there are more people capable of keeping Jenkins running, which would allow the UI team to focus more on the TestSwarm integration
[14:24:15] <johnbender> yes!
[14:24:20] <johnbender> infra is often a bottle neck
[14:24:30] <jzaefferer> tomorrow and next week are pretty much blocked for me
[14:24:34] <jzaefferer> the week after I'm good
[14:24:34] <johnbender> and I'd love to expose the results in more detail than the jenkins emails provide right now

[14:24:53] <jzaefferer> maybe you can start looking into porting your existing ruby-based job to our server?
[14:24:55] <johnbender> gseguin: reading
[14:25:06] <jzaefferer> I don't see much need for discussion there
[14:25:14] <johnbender> jzaefferer: as long as ruby and rubygems are isntalled it should be trivia;
[14:25:17] <johnbender> *trivial
[14:25:29] <johnbender> the deps are vendored
[14:25:30] <jzaefferer> well, if not, just install them
[14:25:34] <johnbender> kk
[14:25:42] <jzaefferer> yum yum yum...
[14:25:48] <johnbender> jzaefferer: the install is mostly automated with chef
[14:25:54] <johnbender> have to decide whether that's worth setting up here
[14:25:58] <johnbender> anyway
[14:26:01] <jzaefferer> well, not right now
[14:26:05] <johnbender> I'll toss it on the stack
[14:26:10] <jzaefferer> but that's a topic worth discussing
[14:26:17] <jzaefferer> danheberden and gnarf got plans for that
[14:26:27] <jzaefferer> I think you should get involved in that as well
[14:26:32] <jzaefferer> eddiemonge, maybe, too
[14:26:39] <jzaefferer> are you guys on the jquery-infrastructure list?
[14:26:41] <johnbender> yah I need to talk with gnarf
[14:26:45] <johnbender> jzaefferer: newp
[14:26:54] <jzaefferer> that should get fixed, too
[14:26:58] <johnbender> I've chatted with danheberden about it
[14:27:08] <jzaefferer> kinda dead of a list right now, but we can revive it anytime
[14:27:08] <johnbender> gnarf: any chance you can put me on the infra list?
[14:27:26] <jzaefferer> 'you can checkout any time, but you can never leave...'
[14:27:44] <johnbender> :D
[14:27:48] <johnbender> that's fine I like infra work
[14:27:52] <toddparker> wowie, catching up. hey jzaefferer!
[14:27:59] <eddiemonge> oh its a vaery active list
[14:28:06] <toddparker> seems like you guys already have a plan
[14:28:07] <jzaefferer> hey eddiemonge
[14:28:09] <eddiemonge> servers are always down
[14:28:12] <johnbender> eddiemonge: maybe you can get me on it?
[14:28:13] <eddiemonge> even though they arent
[14:28:19] <jzaefferer> toddparker: a starting point at least
[14:28:31] <toddparker> thanks for jumping in and help us our jzaefferer
[14:28:35] <johnbender> I look forward to accepting the metaphorical pager
[14:28:47] <toddparker> yeah, baby steps. let's so the easy stuff that will make both our lives easier now
[14:28:49] <jzaefferer> eddiemonge: eh? there were three messages this month...
[14:28:59] <toddparker> then move onto the stuff that will be good for us, but a lotta work
[14:29:17] <toddparker> ooooh. 3 messages. a deluge.
[14:29:30] <jzaefferer> well, I'm mostly looking for synergy. you're maintaining a lot of duplicate efforts right now, we'd be happy to have some of that effort :-)
[14:30:31] <eddiemonge> to infra-alerts? or the google groups list?
[14:30:34] <johnbender> sounds like a good idea to me
[14:30:48] <jzaefferer> eddiemonge: I'm talking about http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-infrastructure/

[14:31:49] <eddiemonge> hmm i havent been getting the emails. wonder if i somehow turned them off
[14:32:08] <jzaefferer> dunno who's owner or moderator of that list, I can't let you in
[14:32:22] <johnbender> danheberden: gnarf: ^
[14:32:55] <jzaefferer> toddparker: you'll be really delighted once browserstack let's us run their mobile clients; not done yet, but supposed to be close
[14:33:54] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I thought we could just point our devices at test swarm? Is there an advantage outside of freeing up devices?
[14:34:00] * johnbender doesn't know much about browserstack 
[14:35:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/Pi3zBg
[14:35:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Switched from line-height to text-indent to accessibly hide buttons. Fixes #1927 - toddparker
[14:37:45] <jzaefferer> johnbender: pointing devices is no fun at all
[14:37:54] <jzaefferer> we need moar automation :-)
[14:38:07] <jzaefferer> basically browserstack will do the pointing for us
[14:38:17] <toddparker> jzaefferer: that would be great. chrome and firefox on desktop aren't the Android brewer by any stretch
[14:38:19] <jzaefferer> they already do with desktop browsers
[14:38:49] <toddparker> that's cool
[14:38:53] <jzaefferer> heading out, ttyl
[14:38:54] <toddparker> so how does that work?
[14:38:57] <toddparker> oh, ok
[14:39:16] <toddparker> jzaefferer: ask richard and scott when would be a good time to chat. sounds like in a week or two?
[14:43:46] <johnbender> toddparker: search commits
[14:43:49] <johnbender> for 1.0.1
[14:44:22] <johnbender> gseguin: I think that will work, though I'm worried about people getting confused
[14:49:23] <toddparker> ?
[14:57:36] <gseguin> johnbender: confused with?
[15:11:53] <gseguin> AWESOME, you can assign owners to pull request now
[15:16:12] <gseguin> toddparker: I like this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3357
[15:16:13] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by jakeboone02 (2w, 5d ago): Allow for ad hoc customization of page loading message
[15:16:38] <gseguin> what do you think about merging it for 1.1 ?
[15:27:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #413: SUCCESS in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/413/
[15:27:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> todd: Switched from line-height to text-indent to accessibly hide buttons. Fixes #1927
[15:38:39] <johnbender> gseguin: NO MOAR FEATURES
[15:38:40] <johnbender> kidding
[15:38:43] <johnbender> it's up to toddparker
[15:39:27] <gseguin> heh, this one is pretty simple and useful I think
[15:39:57] <gseguin> johnbender: so what would people be confused with?
[15:40:37] <johnbender> gseguin: mostly looking at old test suites and setting up new test pages
[15:41:21] <gseguin> johnbender: shouldn't be a problem
[15:41:34] <eddiemonge> johnbender: that list of files needs to include all the files in the docs folder as well. i was going to do it in php
[15:41:44] <eddiemonge> and what happens if this process hangs?
[15:41:45] <gseguin> I'll search and replace jquery.js by jquery.tag.inserter.js
[15:42:07] <johnbender> eddiemonge: it'll just hang
[15:42:27] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I don't have another suggestion tbh
[15:42:28] <eddiemonge> then there will be hung processes that never get cleaned up right?
[15:42:33] <johnbender> eddiemonge: indeed
[15:42:36] <johnbender> eddiemonge: hmm
[15:43:22] <eddiemonge> i think its a problem that needs a lot more thought and maybe unity across all the projects
[15:43:32] <gseguin> ok, I'll convert the rest of the tests and will run them before commiting
[15:43:44] <johnbender> eddiemonge: well I'm less worried about unity and more worried about getting our build running right now
[15:44:08] <johnbender> though we need to address that
[15:44:17] <eddiemonge> i think its an intermittent problem
[15:44:27] <eddiemonge> like i said, i have a feeling java is the problem
[15:44:37] <eddiemonge> node might solve this
[15:44:48] <eddiemonge> but a branch would need to be setup to test it
[15:45:41] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I don't think blocking a web request with an exec is a good diea
[15:45:44] <johnbender> *idea
[15:45:53] <johnbender> let me test out ulimit
[15:45:57] <johnbender> and see if that works
[15:49:05] <eddiemonge> no its really not
[15:51:07] <johnbender> eddiemonge: hrm hrm hrm
[15:55:53] <eddiemonge> ideally the web hook would signal a process to start the build. any additional pings to the hook would queue them up and run after the build finishes
[15:56:30] <eddiemonge> the hook would start the build in the background and finish so it could take new requests
[15:56:30] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'm tempted to just do it this way and see where we end up
[15:56:40] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah job manager
[15:56:41] <johnbender> :(
[15:56:52] <johnbender> we could do actual builds with jenkins
[15:56:57] <johnbender> at some point
[15:57:03] * johnbender points into the future
[15:57:54] <eddiemonge> what would that take?
[15:58:15] <eddiemonge> in an ideal world, the builds would be milliseconds or seconds even instead of the long time it takes now
[15:58:15] <johnbender> eddiemonge: some hackery
[15:58:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: even with node that won't happen
[15:58:57] <johnbender> when I say "even with node" I don't mean because NODE IS SO FAST just that it's the only other option and it is in fact faster than with rhino
[15:59:27] * gseguin is so tempted to say a 4 letter word
[15:59:31] <eddiemonge> i mostly despise java so alternatives are always nice to have
[15:59:40] <gseguin> oh wait johnbender, just said it!
[15:59:47] <johnbender> gseguin: EITHER WAY WE MUST SOLVE THIS PROBLEM
[15:59:48] <johnbender> lol
[16:00:05] <johnbender> eddiemonge: can we just give it a try and I'll watch for processes
[16:00:12] <johnbender> eddiemonge: oh1
[16:00:17] <johnbender> s/1/!/
[16:00:28] <eddiemonge> what is the problem again?
[16:00:30] <johnbender> why don't we invite the other infra guys into the convo
[16:00:55] <johnbender> eddiemonge: blocking the web request on an external process that isn't instant
[16:01:00] <johnbender> or rather
[16:01:30] <eddiemonge> danheberden: yo
[16:01:36] <johnbender> a process where the wall clock time of execution is not bounded by like 1 sec
[16:01:44] <johnbender> danheberden: gnarf: your opinion would be appreciated
[16:01:52] <johnbender> eddiemonge: do they have visibility on the site/
[16:01:52] <johnbender> ?
[16:02:32] <eddiemonge> on the server at least
[16:02:50] <danheberden> eddiemonge whats up?
[16:03:24] <johnbender> danheberden: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/pull/3/files
[16:03:25] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no pull request found
[16:03:41] <johnbender> we're trying to spawn the build
[16:03:45] <johnbender> since it's not super fast
[16:03:51] <johnbender> nor will it likely ever be in the future
[16:04:06] <johnbender> and there's a valid concern about zombie processes
[16:04:23] <johnbender> I could limit it in cpu time with ulimit but that's not wall clock time
[16:04:31] <eddiemonge> i still think its a java issue. there are a lot of java things running on that server at random times
[16:04:48] <johnbender> eddiemonge: that may be the case but this solves both issues
[16:05:02] <johnbender> since we shouldn't be blocking the request
[16:06:14] <eddiemonge> danheberden: what server type was is the site on? could we add more memory to it to give java more room to play?
[16:06:45] <eddiemonge> johnbender: i think we should be blocking the request or queueing them to prevent the race conditions
[16:07:08] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I agree with the second option but I don't have time to set that up
[16:07:11] <johnbender> and I want the build to work
[16:08:32] <johnbender> eddiemonge: alternately we can just try raising the ceiling on the request timeout to check that is in fact the problem
[16:08:50] <danheberden> so, i'm a bit out of context - but it sounds like the jvm is exhausting all the resources?
[16:09:03] <johnbender> danheberden: that's not the case every time this fails
[16:09:10] <johnbender> the log output is being truncated
[16:09:18] <eddiemonge> johnbender: which i did
[16:09:29] <johnbender> which makes me wonder if it's ending the request early
[16:09:42] <danheberden> we can get more memory, but if that isn't the concern...
[16:10:15] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/commit/d875a73e51b6b1cbf655ccda9d8c548a564dee71
[16:10:15] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no commit found
[16:10:33] <eddiemonge> its slightly hard to troubleshoot this
[16:10:35] <johnbender> as of 2:34 server time it's still cutting off the output
[16:12:02] <danheberden> and i assume jenkins is being started with enough ram?
[16:12:12] <danheberden> (it's a jvm, right?)
[16:12:14] <johnbender> danheberden: shrug
[16:12:17] <johnbender> no idea
[16:12:29] <danheberden> eddiemonge ?
[16:12:38] <johnbender> eddiemonge: should we just try the node thing and see where we get here?
[16:12:45] <johnbender> I'd like to get this done today if we can
[16:12:58] <eddiemonge> no idea
[16:13:16] <eddiemonge> johnbender: the build at 2:37 wasnt cut off
[16:13:23] <johnbender> gseguin: can you make the "or node" thing and make sure it builds in both situations?
[16:13:42] <gseguin> not right now but very soon
[16:14:16] <danheberden> johnbender what's the purpose of jenkins?
[16:14:32] <johnbender> danheberden: it runs builds for UI and core I think
[16:14:44] <danheberden> jenkins, for ui, runs tests
[16:14:44] <johnbender> danheberden: you'll have to ask jorn though I think he set it up, or at least he knows more than I do
[16:14:54] <danheberden> i don't think the jvm for ui is jenkins?
[16:15:01] <danheberden> it just runs an ant script
[16:15:17] <johnbender> danheberden: hmm, well jenkins is written in java
[16:15:25] <johnbender> not sure what you mean otherwise
[16:15:27] <danheberden> yeah - i wish i knew more about it
[16:15:37] <johnbender> danheberden: I know a fair amount
[16:15:38] <danheberden> i'm just trying to, like, actually understand what's wrong, where and why
[16:15:44] <johnbender> danheberden: as are we
[16:15:54] <danheberden> like, why is jquerymobile running java?
[16:15:59] <johnbender> it doesn't look, to me at least, like the builds are finishing
[16:16:04] <danheberden> s/jquerymobile/jquerymobile.com
[16:16:08] <johnbender> danheberden: to run jenkins
[16:16:10] <johnbender> and to run our build
[16:16:20] <danheberden> that shouldn't be happening on the domain, though
[16:16:30] <johnbender> not sure what you mean
[16:16:33] <eddiemonge> google compiler and yui compressor and r.js maybe?
[16:16:33] <danheberden> that should be happenning elsewhere and scp/rsync ing the files elsewhere
[16:16:56] <johnbender> danheberden: you mean they should be on different machines?
[16:17:06] <danheberden> johnbender no matter, corey will be implementing our setup so move that soon
[16:17:11] <danheberden> johnbender definitely
[16:17:19] <johnbender> danheberden: I'm just rolling with what's there
[16:17:27] <danheberden> oyu don't want jquerymobile.com choking cuz it's building, ya know?
[16:17:29] <johnbender> it hasn't been an issue, and I'm still not convinced it is now
[16:17:35] <danheberden> gotcha
[16:17:40] <johnbender> though you make perfect sense
[16:17:44] <danheberden> well shoot me any news if you find out ):
[16:17:46] <danheberden> *  :)
[16:17:48] <johnbender> danheberden: will do
[16:18:10] <eddiemonge> danheberden: is http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js built manually then pushed?
[16:18:21] <johnbender> eddiemonge: is the output not truncated in your emails?
[16:18:26] <johnbender> could it just be the loggin mechanism?
[16:18:37] <danheberden> eddiemonge aye
[16:18:42] <eddiemonge> johnbender: it wasnt
[16:19:00] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ok then the logging mechanism we have in there is fail
[16:19:04] * johnbender sighs
[16:19:13] <danheberden> unfortunately, it's on the bugs box right now, eddiemonge but that's the point of services.jquery.com
[16:20:02] <eddiemonge> johnbender: yeah the pushing of the logs to php errors isnt the best way but its the easiest and fastest
[16:21:00] <johnbender> eddiemonge: mind you I put it in there
[16:21:07] <johnbender> sadly I am a php newb
[16:21:29] <johnbender> eddiemonge: well at the very least the way I have it setup will be much better at logging! :D
[16:21:59] <johnbender> eddiemonge: can I just take out the nohup?
[16:22:12] <johnbender> and then at least we can look at logs with better output?
[16:22:38] <eddiemonge> let me add better logging. give me about 15 minutes
[16:22:56] <johnbender> eddiemonge: if we can do it without the array that would be super mucho awesome too
[16:23:22] <johnbender> though I still think the shell stuff should be in a shell script so we don't have to do shell_exec every time
[16:24:45] <eddiemonge> i wonder if theres a git-php lib to get rid of most of the exec stuff
[16:28:37] <johnbender> eddiemonge: either way more logging would be amazing
[16:28:40] <johnbender> then we can figure this out
[16:30:37] <eddiemonge> oh it has plenty of logging. i need to get it so you can see it more accurately. the emails are a lot to take in
[16:31:04] <johnbender> eddiemonge: well and there's a limit on who can see the emails
[16:31:13] <johnbender> logs are available to anyone who as access to the server
[16:31:28] <johnbender> or we could send an email to the mailing list or some such
[16:31:31] <johnbender> anyway
[16:31:32] <johnbender> anything
[16:31:35] <johnbender> right now is better
[16:31:39] <johnbender> just need to get that build working again
[16:32:32] <eddiemonge> gseguin: anyway to optimize the r.js build time? seems like that tripled the build time for the js file concats
[16:33:52] <gseguin> use node instead of java
[16:34:04] <gseguin> it doesn't just concat
[16:34:15] <gseguin> it figures out dependencies
[16:34:28] <gseguin> that's what's taking time
[16:35:30] <eddiemonge> will node speed that up? that part alone takes almost 30 seconds
[16:36:04] <gseguin> yep it'll take 2+ seconds with node
[16:43:58] <johnbender> gseguin: eddiemonge: any movement
[16:44:14] <gseguin> of the earth crust?
[16:44:37] <gseguin> I'm still debugging an issue here
[16:44:41] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[16:45:15] <johnbender> eddiemonge: if you don't have time to set up the better logging I'm fine just pushing what I have now and we can make changes as we get something better
[16:45:31] <johnbender> at the very least I'd like to understand what's going on
[16:46:03] <johnbender> "work in progress" is better than, "not working at all"
[16:46:11] <johnbender> or "not working at all with no movement"
[16:47:45] <gseguin> johnbender: fixedToolbar test is throwing when ran with 1.6.4
[16:48:03] <eddiemonge> johnbender: wrapping it up now
[16:48:15] <johnbender> gseguin: yay we caught something then
[16:48:19] <johnbender> gseguin: alright
[16:48:32] <johnbender> then I just need to alter the build a bit when you get that pushed
[16:48:35] <gseguin> johnbender: $( "meta[name='viewport']" ) returns nothing
[16:48:39] <johnbender> gseguin: it defaults to something right?
[16:49:02] <gseguin> yes it defaults to 1.7.1
[16:50:00] <johnbender> cool
[16:50:02] <gnarf> johnbender: sorry for the super delayed response
[16:50:05] <gnarf> been offline for a bit
[16:50:25] <gnarf> dan and I were talking about getting puppet setup
[16:50:41] <johnbender> gnarf: I think we chatted about that at some point
[16:50:51] <johnbender> gnarf: I would love an excuse to learn how to use it
[16:50:54] <gnarf> but like talk to danheberden - lets schedule a skype call about it or somethi
[16:51:03] <johnbender> I'm in
[16:51:06] <gnarf> danheberden: ?
[16:51:25] <johnbender> gnarf: danheberden: I'm also happy to set up local dev environments with vagrant so you can test your puppet manifests
[16:51:57] <johnbender> you'll note this is the second or third time I've tried to push vagrant on you
[16:52:03] <johnbender> :D
[16:53:44] <johnbender> gnarf == Corey eh?
[16:53:45] <johnbender> sorry
[16:54:28] <gnarf> yup!
[16:54:32] <johnbender> just double checking that I know everyone
[16:55:19] <johnbender> gnarf: danheberden: sending a message to the google group
[16:57:49] <gseguin> johnbender: for the docs...
[16:57:58] <gseguin> jquery.tag.inserter or not?
[16:58:04] <johnbender> gseguin: go for it
[16:58:07] <johnbender> we can always change it
[16:59:32] <gseguin> I've got some navigation failures :(
[16:59:46] <johnbender> gseguin: for which?
[16:59:55] <gseguin> 1.7.1
[17:00:10] <gseguin> re-running just navigation
[17:00:20] <johnbender> gseguin: ah you're running with /test/unit
[17:00:32] <gseguin> yeah
[17:00:42] <johnbender> gseguin: the /js/jquery.js is 1.7.1
[17:00:53] <gseguin> I changed that
[17:01:12] <johnbender> gseguin: I would leave that in there for now
[17:01:14] <gseguin> it's now just an AMD exporter for jquery < 1.7
[17:01:23] <gseguin> I can't
[17:01:28] <johnbender> ??
[17:01:55] <gseguin> otherwise when modules are requiring jquery and you've loaded 1.6.4
[17:02:06] <gseguin> it'll load jquery twice
[17:02:17] <johnbender> gseguin: even if they have the extension on there?
[17:02:21] <johnbender> it'll load the file?
[17:02:25] <gseguin> yeah
[17:02:27] <johnbender> ...
[17:02:28] <johnbender> wtf
[17:02:36] <gseguin> I tried with and without the extension
[17:02:40] <gseguin> navigation passed
[17:02:48] <johnbender> gseguin: lets do this t hen
[17:02:53] <johnbender> err
[17:02:53] <johnbender> hmm
[17:03:16] <gseguin> I'll put it in the branch
[17:03:21] <johnbender> gseguin: lets put the extra versions in another dir
[17:03:28] <johnbender> external or something
[17:03:55] <gseguin> the jquery-1.7.1.js and jquery-1.6.4.js ?
[17:04:00] <johnbender> gseguin: yes
[17:04:02] <gseguin> what for?
[17:04:09] <gseguin> I mean it makes sense
[17:04:10] <johnbender> gseguin: I'd like this to leave what we have in place
[17:04:18] <gseguin> it shouldn't be there in the first place
[17:04:23] <johnbender> what?
[17:04:26] <johnbender> jquery.js?
[17:04:44] <gseguin> yeah
[17:04:46] <johnbender> I really want to avoid monkeying with everything else just to get this build setup properly
[17:04:47] <gseguin> for instance
[17:05:14] <gseguin> I'll push that to the branch
[17:05:26] <johnbender> gseguin: push what?
[17:05:35] <gseguin> we can review changes and you can pull it to try out things
[17:05:38] <gseguin> my changes
[17:05:57] <johnbender> alright
[17:06:00] * johnbender sighs
[17:06:03] <johnbender> I didn't get shit done today
[17:06:11] <johnbender> eddiemonge: whats the word on the logging?
[17:06:17] <eddiemonge> its up.
[17:06:17] <gseguin> yeah you did
[17:07:02] <johnbender> eddiemonge: where is it logging to?
[17:07:03] <eddiemonge> the log is output to /test/posthook.log
[17:07:08] <eddiemonge> running a test build now
[17:07:08] <johnbender> kk
[17:09:46] <eddiemonge> and its done
[17:09:52] <eddiemonge> almost two minutes for the build
[17:10:11] <eddiemonge> although half that time is spent pushing the files to the cdn because its pushing the whole project
[17:10:33] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah node will speed that up
[17:10:37] <johnbender> but it won't make it 2 seconds
[17:12:02] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 5 new commits to jquery-version-selector: http://git.io/m7Nl3g

[17:12:02] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/jquery-version-selector] Use jQuery tag inserter instead of pointing directly at jquery.js - Ghislain Seguin
[17:12:02] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/jquery-version-selector] Use jQuery tag inserter instead of pointing directly at jquery.js - Ghislain Seguin
[17:12:10] <johnbender> gseguin: you're saying the issues is that the asyncLoad will load a special version of jquery
[17:12:23] <johnbender> or the old version of it rather
[17:12:34] <johnbender> instead of the one your script loader inserts?
[17:12:40] <gseguin> so say you load 1.6.4 via script tag
[17:12:50] <johnbender> right
[17:12:54] <gseguin> since it doesn't export itself as an AMD module
[17:13:04] <johnbender> it will get reloaded by amd
[17:13:05] <gseguin> any module that declares jquery as dep
[17:13:14] <gseguin> will go fetch jquery.js
[17:13:32] <gseguin> so you end up with 2 versions of jquery loaded
[17:13:39] <johnbender> so can we just hack that into our version of 1.6.4 since it will define that module from now on?
[17:13:58] <gseguin> that's what I do in jquery.js
[17:14:05] <johnbender> why in jquery.js?
[17:14:25] <gseguin> because when you have define( [ "jquery" ...
[17:14:45] <gseguin> requirejs will go fetch "jquery.js" unless you configure it otherwise
[17:14:59] <johnbender> if fix up 1.6.4 to define the module though it won't
[17:15:04] <gseguin> and configuring it on every html page would a royal pain
[17:15:34] <gseguin> can you rephrase?
[17:15:59] <johnbender> gseguin: if you just alter jquery-1.6.4.js to export the jquery module then it won't reload jquery
[17:16:12] <johnbender> just hack it in
[17:16:15] <gseguin> yeah but I hate to do that
[17:16:26] <gseguin> because it's not my file
[17:16:39] <johnbender> I don't want to fuck with the other parts of the source tree to support this in the build
[17:16:58] <johnbender> can the script loader just define the module if it's not already defined for us?
[17:17:00] <gseguin> I changed everything to use jquery.tag.inserter.js
[17:17:06] <johnbender> that's fine
[17:17:13] <gseguin> so we're fine
[17:17:25] <johnbender> gseguin: except I don't want to change jquery.js
[17:17:44] <eddiemonge> johnbender: http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/posthook.log
[17:17:50] <johnbender> yah
[17:17:59] <eddiemonge> toddparker: added a timestamp to the branches index: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/
[17:18:00] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I saw it
[17:18:04] <gseguin> let's involve James in that discussion
[17:18:12] <johnbender> gseguin: so
[17:18:25] <johnbender> tbh
[17:18:33] <johnbender> I think we're burning too much time on this for the build process
[17:18:48] <gseguin> this is not a build process thing
[17:18:55] <gseguin> it's for testing
[17:19:03] <johnbender> sorry
[17:19:05] <johnbender> misnomer
[17:19:13] <johnbender> jenkins does "builds"
[17:19:27] <johnbender> s/build process/test runs/
[17:20:20] <gseguin> so I'm not sure how else you would do to support testing / runnning with different versions of jQuery
[17:20:55] <johnbender> gseguin: like I said, can't we just have the script loader define the jquery module if the version is 1.6.4
[17:21:10] <johnbender> define( "jquery", [], function () { return jQuery; } );
[17:21:36] <johnbender> and move those files to a tests/ subdir
[17:22:07] <johnbender> we don't support amd in prod or recommend it so I'm not concerned about people trying to use 1.6.4 and jqm with amd
[17:22:14] <johnbender> it's sort of "not our problem"
[17:22:20] <johnbender> so I don't want to solve it
[17:22:37] <gseguin> hmm let me try that
[17:22:50] <johnbender> and in the worst possible case they can do the above
[17:23:46] <gseguin> I still don't see a problem with changing the content of jquery.js given that we now have the version stamped file in that same directory
[17:24:30] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't want the version stamped thing in there either
[17:24:56] <eddiemonge> ... someones fussy today ...
[17:25:03] <gseguin> and the reason for that?
[17:25:03] <johnbender> yes I IS!
[17:25:09] <johnbender> totally political
[17:25:22] <johnbender> we've been messing with our file structure and "how things work" too much lately
[17:25:26] <johnbender> I want to minimize that for a while
[17:25:44] <johnbender> moreover
[17:25:53] <johnbender> the test suite should be the biggest duct taped piece of crap ever
[17:26:01] <johnbender> "as long as it runs our tests"
[17:26:09] <johnbender> otherwise we're spending too much time on it
[17:26:21] <johnbender> this is all my opinion though
[17:26:26] <johnbender> that is to say
[17:26:33] <johnbender> you aren't wrong _AT ALL_
[17:26:42] <johnbender> I just want to minimize pain and get this setup so it works
[17:26:52] <johnbender> taking into account the jarring changes we've made recently
[17:26:58] <gseguin> I think it's a good clue to have the version in the filename
[17:27:00] <johnbender> FEELINGS DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
[17:27:18] <gseguin> but oh well, I chose my battles
[17:27:34] <gseguin> s/chose/choose/
[17:27:38] <johnbender> gseguin: again you are not wrong
[17:27:49] <johnbender> you are totally right
[17:27:53] <johnbender> I've had that same thought myself
[17:27:57] <johnbender> but lets delay that change for a bit
[17:28:02] <gseguin> oh no worries man
[17:30:59] <johnbender> heading home
[17:31:03] <johnbender> gseguin: thanks for hanging with me
[17:31:10] <gseguin> no problem
[17:31:17] <johnbender> eddiemonge: THANK YOU FOR THE LOGS <3<3<3<3
[17:31:19] <gseguin> I may login later tonight
[17:31:30] <gseguin> not sure though
[17:31:31] <johnbender> gseguin: cool I might be on late, but my moms in town so maybe not
[17:31:42] <gseguin> I will push somthing to that branch soon
