[02:34:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[02:37:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can't reproduce https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5094 on my Google Chrome Version 23.0.1271.6 dev
[02:38:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Fedora 15 desktop.
[02:41:39] <_|Nix|_> ... and anyway, how do you set the transition to slideup? In Google Chrome we fall back to fade for all transitions, don't we?

[05:08:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong!
[05:08:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I can't reproduce that popup issue (5094)
[05:08:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can you edit tests/functiona/hashchange in master to reproduce it there?
[05:09:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am testing again, but I was able to reproduce the first time
[05:09:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I added a nav menu like the one in the issue.
[05:11:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm, the first time I tested it was easier to reproduce
[05:11:36] <uGoMobi> I now saw it one time
[05:11:51] <uGoMobi> but have to figure out what is the specific sequence
[05:13:44] <uGoMobi> errr
[05:14:01] <uGoMobi> that JS Bin was set to transition "none"
[05:14:39] <uGoMobi> I am still not used to JS Bin not creating a new version each time I make a change
[05:54:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/20
[05:54:55] <uGoMobi> Can you see the issue when you test that page?
[08:24:19] <_|Nix|_> STOP THE PRESSES! https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5118
[08:24:37] <_|Nix|_> Maybe we should push that into 1.2.0 ...
[08:25:48] <toddmparker_> testing...
[08:25:52] <toddmparker_> Hi all
[08:25:57] <Wilto> Didn’t work, Todd. Still can’t see you.
[08:26:01] <toddmparker_> sorry I was out yesterday at a funeral
[08:26:12] <toddmparker_> wait a minute...why I outta
[08:28:56] <toddmparker_> Ok, so I wanted to start coordinating with everyone on 1.2 final
[08:29:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: What do you think about https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5118 ?
[08:30:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: This worked earlier, but it broke during the popup refactor. After looking up the pre-refactor solution, I have a patch for it. I discovered the issue during the sequence tests I'm writing for johnbender's nav refactor.
[08:30:35] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I should've pushed these sequence tests a lot sooner :-S
[08:30:59] <tybenz> toddmparker_: ping
[08:31:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: The funny thing is, I ran them manually, but, of course, that's not good enough.
[08:32:51] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: we do need to look at that and tryt o get a 1.2.1 out soon
[08:33:00] <toddmparker_> hey tybenz - how goes?
[08:33:25] <toddmparker_> johnbender: are we in good shape for releasing today? rather, anyone know of a reason why not  release?
[08:33:46] <tybenz> toddmparker_: good. i added 1.2 to TR. its up on /themeroller-test if you want to take a look
[08:34:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK, so you're saying we move tht
[08:34:26] <toddmparker_> great tybenz
[08:34:28] <_|Nix|_> patch to 1.2.1?
[08:34:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: The good news is, it's a popup issue, not a nav issue.
[08:34:59] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: saying we probably don't want to monkey with code for final at this point
[08:35:05] <toddmparker_> that is good
[08:36:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK. Cool. I'll re-milestone the bug then.
[08:37:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Done. 1.2.1 it is.

[08:47:24] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: thanks
[08:47:49] <toddmparker_> i'm hopping into a meeting, but if things looks good on the download builder and TR we can push this late today
[08:48:31] <_|Nix|_> +1
[08:50:46] <toddmparker_> tybenz: TR looks great
[08:51:01] <toddmparker_> i downloaded a theme and it all looks good to me
[08:51:19] <tybenz> toddmparker_: awesome. easy as running one script.
[08:51:23] <toddmparker_> gseguin: do you just need to wait for us to tag before you can do your downloader magic?
[08:51:37] <toddmparker_> you make it look easy. automation FTW
[08:56:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes
[08:56:04] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we are
[08:56:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: lets release because I have inifinity billion branches to merge
[08:56:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: also I got started on the nav refactor
[08:57:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: +1
[09:04:44] * _|Nix|_ is ready to pounce on the tagged commit
[09:17:59] <toddmparker_> yeah, i want to get 1.2 out so we can get back to building stuff
[09:18:24] <toddmparker_> as soon as i get a break here, i'll queu up the release
[09:27:32] <mspisars> toddmparker_: 1.2 final?
[09:28:22] <toddmparker_> yes
[09:28:31] <toddmparker_> i'm just getting hte blog, site and such ready to go
[09:28:45] <mspisars> sweet
[10:03:25] <agcolom> Hi!
[10:03:41] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, I saw that afterwards ;-) thx
[10:13:51] <uGoMobi> good afternoon/evening all
[10:14:32] <uGoMobi> agcolom: np :)
[10:15:04] <agcolom> Good afternoon/evening Jasper!
[10:15:21] <uGoMobi> johnbender: did you see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5113 ? especially "issue 2"
[10:15:32] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[10:15:45] <uGoMobi> evening here for sure :)
[10:16:41] <johnbender> uGoMobi: no, but that looks like a bug :)
[10:16:43] <johnbender> or a couple bugs
[10:16:56] <johnbender> There could be a load order issue with the button markup module I suppose
[10:17:07] <johnbender> uGoMobi: if you want to split it out you can assign that one to me
[10:17:13] <uGoMobi> johnbender: the most weird thing is the difference between local and build
[10:17:29] <johnbender> yah
[10:17:42] <johnbender> that's the part you can assign to me
[10:17:55] <johnbender> it might be a load order / dependency issue
[10:18:32] <uGoMobi> ok, I will look into the other parts
[10:23:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: just let me know when you want me to tag and push
[10:24:04] * johnbender goes back into his cave to continue working on nav

[10:24:13] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Wilto: johnbender: gseguin: just out of interest, why the yellow theme e? (was it just for error messages?)
[10:24:31] <johnbender> agcolom: I'm not a design guy :)
[10:25:00] <agcolom> johnbender: Well, I thought I might get asked at some point! and I have no idea!!!!
[10:25:23] <agcolom> (especially at the dev summit!)
[10:26:29] <uGoMobi> To make mapping of color swatches consistent across our widgets, we have followed the convention that swatch "a" is the highest level of visual priority (black in our default theme), "b" is secondary level (blue) and "c" is the baseline level (gray) that we use by default in many situations, "d" for an alternate secondary level and "e" as an accent swatch.
[10:26:50] <uGoMobi> yellow def qualifies as accent :)
[10:29:16] <agcolom> uGoMobi: right.... but the yellow and the blue don't go as well as the other color together... so no ideal for form element...
[10:29:26] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Well done for finding that though ;-)
[10:31:22] <uGoMobi> I think an "accent swatch" is primarily to style just one or a few elements on a page, not to style the whole page with that swatch
[10:31:46] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, that's what I am thinking also...
[10:32:10] <agcolom> it's bugged me since day one! About time I ask the question ;)
[10:32:17] <uGoMobi> haha
[10:32:45] <uGoMobi> you want to change it to Twingo pink? ;-)
[10:33:05] <agcolom> hey! why not ;-)
[10:33:15] <uGoMobi> would look nice together with the blue
[10:33:40] <agcolom> indeed!
[10:34:54] <agcolom> So is there a new format for the meetings?
[10:40:58] <frequent> @uGoMobi, @agcolom: don't mess with the yellow! It's my follow-the-white-rabbit-color!
[10:42:27] <uGoMobi> frequent: :D
[10:42:34] <frequent> ;-)
[10:42:38] <agcolom> frequent: no worries there ;-) I just want to know the origin ;-) (but my pink twingo is very nice as well ;-) )
[10:43:14] <frequent> agcolom: pretty-in-pink
[10:44:23] <agcolom> :-)
[10:47:26] <agcolom> yes, everything is pretty in pink! (but that's just because I'm a girl!)
[10:49:24] <frequent> @agcolom: ;-)
[11:07:35] <toddmparker_> yeah, accent
[11:07:44] <toddmparker_> dunno really, just seemed useful
[11:07:58] <toddmparker_> we can do hot pink
[11:10:45] <uGoMobi> or the lightest green from the logo
[11:10:56] <uGoMobi> looked nice when I tried it on the ribbon
[11:11:58] <toddmparker_> we can make a much bigger theme for the docs that has a bunch of additional swatch letters. we already have a green one in docs.css
[11:12:14] <toddmparker_> ok, getting the website updates queued up for the release
[11:12:19] <toddmparker_> are we all set?
[11:12:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I think so
[11:12:48] <toddmparker_> tybenz: we'll need to flip this over when we launch. i think i have the login for control too
[11:12:56] <toddmparker_> ok, gimme a few...
[11:20:33] <toddmparker_> johnbender: ok, the web site and blog post is ready
[11:20:37] <toddmparker_> let's do this thing
[11:20:48] <toddmparker_> tag and go
[11:21:15] <toddmparker_> tybenz and gseguin - get ready to flip the switch on TR and download builder

[11:31:04] <toddmparker_> woo hoo
[11:31:13] <toddmparker_> alright, on to 1.3!
[11:31:33] <toddmparker_> we should quickly look at 1.1.2
[11:32:03] <toddmparker_> maybe we can do an rc in a bit
[11:32:16] <toddmparker_> can mauriceG cna do a changelog
[11:33:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NM ... got it.
[11:33:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that would be a good idea
[11:33:53] <agcolom> toddmparker_: http://jquerymobile.com/ still shows rc2 for me, but might be a cache issue?

[11:37:18] <toddmparker_> i dunno
[11:37:23] <toddmparker_> definitely a cashe thing
[11:37:27] <toddmparker_> cache :)
[11:37:35] <toddmparker_> CDN woes
[11:37:48] <toddmparker_> shift+reload
[11:38:23] <agcolom> I even tried browserstack!
[11:38:53] <toddmparker_> woah
[11:39:23] <agcolom> is everyone else not seeing rc2 on  http://jquerymobile.com/ ?
[11:39:32] * agcolom is going mad??
[11:39:51] <toddmparker_> try changing characters after the ?
[11:40:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I opened ^ in Google Chrome incognito, and it shows RC2.
[11:40:01] <toddmparker_> it's on a CDN with heavy caching
[11:40:05] <agcolom> toddmparker_: I have!!!! all sorts!!!!
[11:40:10] <toddmparker_> europeans
[11:40:19] <toddmparker_> you get news late
[11:40:25] <Wilto> We’re not using metric data; I bet that’s why.
[11:40:35] <mspisars> no I'm EST and still seeing RC2
[11:40:39] <Wilto> Huh.
[11:40:42] <mspisars> cache cleared
[11:41:32] <_|Nix|_> I guess we just gotta wait for the timeouts ...
[11:41:35] <Wilto> Huh.

[11:42:41] <mspisars> http://jquerymobile.com/download/

[11:45:12] <agcolom> toddmparker_: yes ;-) sorry my browser crached!!!!!
[11:45:46] <toddmparker_> try again
[11:45:50] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Wilto  http://jquerymobile.com/blog is still RC2 for me too :-)
[11:45:51] <toddmparker_> just nuked the cache
[11:45:54] <_|Nix|_> We're good.
[11:45:56] <agcolom> sorry I meant :-(
[11:46:00] <mspisars> there it is
[11:46:05] <mspisars> :)
[11:46:11] <agcolom> oh yes :-)
[11:46:16] <agcolom> celebration!!!!

[11:46:51] <_|Nix|_> How's that for effects?
[11:46:57] <mspisars> sideways??? :/

[11:47:11] <toddmparker_> i try
[11:47:16] <_|Nix|_> mspisars: I'd rather not paste in, like 7 lines.
[11:47:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: still got 10 fingers?
[11:48:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I got all 10. Some of them are across the room, though.
[11:48:09] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:48:14] <_|Nix|_> :)
[11:48:46] <agcolom> Shame on me! I just realised that my daughter hasn't had her dinner!!!!!!
[11:48:50] <uGoMobi> ohh nice 1.2.0 final logo
[11:49:47] <toddmparker_> thanks
[11:50:47] <agcolom> yes, very nice! And lovely screen shots in the announcement!
[11:52:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can we make a grunt target that outputs the test page URLs? Like, say, grunt test-paths that outputs $ROOT_DOMAIN/tests/unit/dialog/index.html\n$ROOT_DOMAIN/tests/unit/navigation/index.html\n...?
[11:52:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you can just alter that test paths target to do that if you like
[11:53:02] <johnbender> makes sense
[11:53:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm not sure such a target exists ...
[11:53:36] <johnbender> grunt config:test:paths
[11:53:45] <agcolom> toddmparker_: why the yellow theme? (why yellow and not red or other colors?)
[11:53:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm
[11:53:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: one sec
[11:54:11] <agcolom> toddmparker_: was it just to make things stand out?
[11:54:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: grunt config:test:pages
[11:56:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... right, prefixed with $ROOT_DOMAIN, eh?
[11:56:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: done
[11:56:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/fKQViQ
[11:56:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] output the root domain prepended to the path where available - John Bender

[11:56:45] <_|Nix|_> Nice!
[11:57:29] <toddmparker_> see we have a backlog of commits hanging out in branches :)
[11:58:00] <Krinkle> _|Nix|_: When the test runs through testswarm, the browserstack browser will be automatically shut down. Not sure if that's what you mean though..

[11:58:51] <_|Nix|_> Krinkle: I'm talking plain old desktop browser, so I can test for myself before I push.
[11:59:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, so a whole pile of sequence tests are now in master, ready to give nav a workout.
[11:59:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you just want to know when a test is finished I'm sure you can communicate that to your server and then call something like growl
[12:00:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool
[12:00:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm just thinking that it can be done client-side, because a lot of sites have a link that says "Click here to close this browser window".
[12:01:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: is the goal just to have it go away for knwo when the test is finished?
[12:01:21] <_|Nix|_> Well, window.close() ...
[12:01:37] <johnbender> s/for knwo/or know/
[12:02:23] <mspisars> _|Nix|_ if a windows is openen with JS then it can be closed with JS
[12:03:15] <mspisars> so, I've seen when a page is loaded the first thing it does is window.open("mypage...", "_self");
[12:04:03] <mspisars> lets clean this up... - if a window is oepened with JS then it can...
[12:04:09] <mspisars> FAIL
[12:04:19] <mspisars> opened*
[12:04:58] <_|Nix|_> mspisars: I suppose I can just leave them open for now, but I dunno how FF will handle having, like, 78 windows open.
[12:05:24] <mspisars> not well
[12:05:48] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:06:22] <_|Nix|_> Then it might be worth exploring the window.close() thing ... if no tests fail, then window.close() ...
[12:21:47] <gseguin> sorry guys just catching up
[12:22:15] <agcolom> hey gseguin! How are you? 1.2 is out!!!!
[12:22:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Grab a glass!
[12:22:27] <gseguin> yeah I see that ;)
[12:22:40] <gseguin> OH: again?
[12:22:43] <agcolom> and just got a tweet, the French doc is up to date as well! already!
[12:22:57] <gseguin> YAY! congrats guys!
[12:23:04] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The docs are translated? Do URL ...
[12:23:06] <gseguin> I'll push the new version in the builder
[12:23:11] <agcolom> yes

[12:23:46] <agcolom> pasted the wrong thing!
[12:23:53] <gseguin> YAY! the builder backend automagically checked out 1.2.0!
[12:23:53] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[12:24:01] <uGoMobi> smooth
[12:24:02] <agcolom> http://mobile.jquery-fr.com/
[12:24:02] <gseguin> just have to update the front end
[12:24:14] <gseguin> FANTASTIQUE!
[12:25:09] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Got it.
[12:27:05] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Popup form element input hints are not translated.
[12:28:40] <gseguin> gnarf: isn't jquery-mobile.com/download-builder supposed to update automatically on push to master?
[12:29:54] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: where is that?
[12:30:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: http://mobile.jquery-fr.com/
[12:31:12] <gseguin> agcolom: did you do the translation?
[12:31:58] <agcolom> gseguin: no!!!!
[12:32:09] <gseguin> who did it?
[12:32:12] <agcolom> it's forrest17
[12:32:23] <gseguin> nice!
[12:32:33] <agcolom> sorry 	forresst17
[12:32:42] <agcolom> (double r double s)
[12:33:50] <gseguin> toddmparker_: builder updated
[12:34:15] <gseguin> don't understand why there was a manual step in refreshing the front-end
[12:34:20] <agcolom> gseguin: my technical French is not good enough to be able to translate that sort of thing! I just have English words coming into my mind!
[12:34:41] <gseguin> same here agcolom, same here
[12:38:02] <gseguin> toddmparker_, Wilto: I don't know which one of you has access to http://jquerymobile.com/wp-content/themes/jquery-mobile/style.css but it would be great to move the logo rule in there so the download builder also displays the logo

[12:49:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.2-stable] [navigation] Re-instate $.mobile_registerInternalEvents - thanks asyraf9 -- Fixes #4984, #5059 - Gabriel Schulhof
[12:49:49] <_|Nix|_> We're gonna have another 1.1.x, right?
[12:51:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, there will be a 1.1.2
[12:51:23] <uGoMobi> cherry-picking into 2 branches now
[12:52:17] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[12:52:21] <_|Nix|_> Depends on the fix.
[12:52:27] <uGoMobi> true
[12:57:34] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: wiki
[12:57:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What's the word on ._on() and ._off()? I'd like to use it in at least popup, and loader, because it'd simplify popup, and fix 5104 with loader.
[12:57:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: ok
[12:57:47] <toddmparker_> google doc is now outdates

[13:04:09] <uGoMobi> goodnight _|Nix|_
[13:11:20] <gseguin> toddmparker_: did you see my message regarding the logo's css rule?
[13:17:39] <tybenz> toddmparker_: themeroller is now up-to-date
[13:23:45] <gseguin> thanks tybenz!
[13:23:53] <toddmparker_> thanks tybenz
[13:26:00] <tybenz> toddmparker_: one other thing. it seems that the kuler API is down for maintenance until mid-october.
[13:26:32] <tybenz> toddmparker_: not sure how many people even use that part of TR, but we should add a message in that panel just in case. i can do that later tonight
[13:29:37] <toddmparker_> tybenz: bummer re: kuler. maybe we can comment that toggle out and add a mention to the welcome popup
[13:30:00] <toddmparker_> or leave the toggle but swap in a message when clicked
[13:32:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah, lets just take care of bugs for now
[13:32:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and reference the lines that need to be changed in an issue
[13:32:39] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's important but not a priority I don't think
[13:34:15] <tybenz> toddmparker_: yeah i was leaning more towards the 2nd one
[13:34:35] <toddmparker_> +1
[13:54:38] <gnarf> gseguin: push to master = updates stage ; push a semver tag (/^v?\d+\.\d+/) = updates live
[13:56:23] <gseguin> gnarf: is jquerymobile.com/download-builder on that infra yet?
[13:56:46] <gnarf> gseguin: the download-builder instance is on jq03
[13:56:54] <gseguin> I'm talking about the index.html
[13:56:58] <gnarf> s/jq03/jq02/
[13:57:07] <gseguin> no that's just the backend
[13:57:17] <gnarf> ahh
[13:57:19] <gnarf> sorry then
[13:57:28] <gnarf> jquerymobile.com is on eol2 I think
[13:57:43] <gnarf> i don't have any specific updates setup there (yet) -- I could
[13:57:48] <gseguin> yest that's right
[13:57:59] <gnarf> check out http://jquerymobile.com/control/
[13:58:05] <gnarf> hrm
[13:58:07] <gnarf> what was that url
[13:58:15] <gseguin> that would be great to just have to push to the github repo to get that page updated
[13:58:51] <gseguin> http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[13:58:51] <gnarf> http://control.jquerymobile.com/
[13:58:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I won't be at the tech cabal on wednesday
[13:59:04] <gnarf> ^^^ I think that is how they update it
[13:59:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: not 100% on the team meeting either but I'll try
[13:59:40] <gseguin> gnarf: I just ssh to the box and do a `sudo git pull`
[14:00:27] <gnarf> gseguin: works for now? eventually this will all be in the new wordpress sites
[14:00:45] <gseguin> yeah it does
[14:00:56] <gseguin> just trying to get rid of manual steps
[14:01:06] <gseguin> but yeah I can live with that
[14:05:12] <gnarf> gseguin: I mean, I could setup a post-receive to do it - put it up as an issue for me on infrastructure with the manual steps you take to update it and I can get it rollin
[14:05:34] <gseguin> ok will do
[14:05:39] <gseguin> thanks a lot!
[14:11:41] <toddmparker_> ok johnbender
