[03:58:57] <_|Nix|_> OK ... something really strange is happening ... all my fixes have been reverted - like the one that fixes the case where AJAX isn't working ...
[04:00:34] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: Really? Hmmm
[04:00:40] <toddmparker> Hello
[04:00:45] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: You too
[04:00:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Really weird ...
[04:00:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I hope it wasn't me merging in the popup arrow.
[04:01:01] <uGoMobi> morning
[04:01:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you mean fixes in tests?
[04:02:55] <uGoMobi> I wonder if this has to do with server migration
[04:03:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono. Fixes in demos.
[04:03:34] <uGoMobi> oh no
[04:03:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like my ajax-doesn't-work-fix ... it's gone from master.
[04:03:58] <toddmparker> We moved a lot of stuff around 
[04:04:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah.
[04:04:46] <toddmparker> Is it a separate JS
[04:05:01] <toddmparker> Or part of demo JS
[04:05:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's part of docs/_assets/view-source.js
[04:06:07] <toddmparker> Huh
[04:06:58] <_|Nix|_> Very weird ...

[04:07:38] <_|Nix|_> So ^ is a re-fix ...
[04:08:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is the fix in this version? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/6564565ff95c5c97b9258422840e80ec0e3ba107/demos/_assets/js/view-source.js

[04:09:31] <uGoMobi> ah ok that one
[04:09:34] * uGoMobi looking
[04:10:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I just pushed that fix again, so it's there again ...
[04:10:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We need to see where it disappeared.
[04:10:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I am investigating where it has gone missing
[04:10:50] <uGoMobi> right
[04:11:40] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[04:12:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think I already found out
[04:12:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I made a backup branch before we started to move things around
[04:12:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the fix is not in there either
[04:13:06] <toddmparker> Huh
[04:13:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: at some point we had to /demos/ folders
[04:13:17] <uGoMobi> one in the root and one subfolder
[04:13:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh no ... I made the fix in the wrong folder.
[04:13:38] <uGoMobi> think so
[04:13:43] <uGoMobi> checking that now
[04:13:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. That's fine. I just hope all the fixes have been transferred correctly.
[04:14:10] <uGoMobi> I wanted to delete the subfolder right away but that broke master 
[04:14:36] <uGoMobi> because the build script was looking for that folder to combine the JS in assets
[04:15:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wow, OK! There it is. Two copies of view-source.js ...
[04:15:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I only fixed on.
[04:15:20] <_|Nix|_> s/on\./one./
[04:15:27] <uGoMobi> the one in /docs/demos/ right?
[04:15:31] <uGoMobi> not /demos/
[04:15:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[04:15:39] <uGoMobi> resolved
[04:15:53] <uGoMobi> let's check changes to that subfolder after it was copied to root
[04:16:03] <uGoMobi> to see if anything missed the boat
[04:16:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I had to re-fix arschmitz's typo as well.
[04:18:49] <uGoMobi> this one from arschmitz probably https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/6775532ed2465d43de633687ba653de0b468cb20
[04:20:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, that fix comes after mine.
[04:20:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Did he also edit the wrong file?
[04:20:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:can you check this one of you https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a7696ea2a919b4f925e282655546306c295893ed
[04:20:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[04:21:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: a7696ea was probably commit in your popup-arrow branch that was merged later
[04:21:54] <toddmparker> Confusing right now, structure wise
[04:22:22] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: not anymore, we have one folder and no branches beside the backup
[04:22:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: but yes, it was confusing
[04:22:45] <uGoMobi> because I couldn't delete the old subfolder
[04:22:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That commit is fine. It's in master.
[04:22:54] <uGoMobi> ok
[04:23:02] <uGoMobi> then it's just that one commit of arschmitz 
[04:23:19] <uGoMobi> see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/master?page=3
[04:24:18] <uGoMobi> you see my commit where i try to delete the subfolder right before yours and arschmitz's
[04:24:49] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[04:25:04] <_|Nix|_> So, I guess we both made changes to the wrong copy.
[04:25:08] <uGoMobi> glad we found it, no need to worry that more stuff is missing
[04:25:13] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[04:25:32] <_|Nix|_> *phew* ... *wipe forehead*
[04:25:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you mind putting arschmitz his back in master??
[04:25:38] <uGoMobi> :)
[04:25:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.

[04:29:17] <uGoMobi> yes sorry, requirejs
[04:29:19] <_|Nix|_> When you juggle this many eggs, you're bound to drop one or two.
[04:29:39] <toddmparker> True
[04:29:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: lucky also many links point to folders and not .html files
[04:30:17] <toddmparker> Yeah, been removing index.html wherever I can
[04:30:23] <uGoMobi> planning on do a search for all file names
[04:30:24] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/widgets/headers/bars-fixed.php
[04:30:35] <uGoMobi> other than index.html/php
[04:30:36] <toddmparker> Scroll down then open search
[04:31:01] <toddmparker> Header is shifted down. Prolly by the chrome height
[04:31:12] <toddmparker> Bug? 
[04:31:44] <uGoMobi> don't see it
[04:31:48] <uGoMobi> on your macbook?
[04:32:16] <toddmparker> iPhone 
[04:32:22] <uGoMobi> aha
[04:32:25] <toddmparker> URL bar hiding I bet
[04:32:27] <uGoMobi> lemme test on iPad
[04:32:40] <toddmparker> iPad doesn't hide chrome
[04:32:46] <toddmparker> iPhone 
[04:32:59] <toddmparker> Or maybe an android phone too
[04:33:14] <uGoMobi> ah that bug
[04:33:31] <uGoMobi> there is ticket for this
[04:35:01] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5532
[04:42:54] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1334: STILL UNSTABLE in 14 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1334/
[04:47:19] <toddmparker> Gotcha
[04:47:41] <toddmparker> I bet if we didn't hide the URL bar in the docs, it would be ok
[04:47:54] <toddmparker> There must be a way to disable that
[04:48:38] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: Can you look at how to not hide the URL bar in the docs JS 
[04:50:04] <uGoMobi> there is also something wrong with updatePagePadding
[04:51:26] <uGoMobi> that's on the list for 1.4 too
[04:51:51] <uGoMobi> it's aways updated in time
[04:53:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I thought we hid the URL bar by scrolling to (0, 0).
[04:54:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think we have some initialScroll or something global config option. IIRC.
[05:06:24] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: Yes we do
[05:06:34] <toddmparker> I'd like to not do that in the demos
[05:16:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, so that's a matter of writing a mobileinit handler for the docs.
[05:18:19] <toddmparker> Thought we had that already for other config stuff
[05:18:27] <toddmparker> Maybe not, but yeah.
[05:18:33] <uGoMobi> yes we do
[05:18:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we load assets JS before JQM JS
[05:19:01] <uGoMobi> so you can put it in there
[05:19:01] <toddmparker> Cool
[05:19:15] <uGoMobi> globalnav.js binds to mobilinit too
[05:19:57] <uGoMobi> learn a lot from docs refactor... didn't know we had a config for that :))
[05:21:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Great!
[05:25:33] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: toddmparker:
[05:25:48] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:28:10] <_|Nix|_> Gah! What is that global config value? It's not documented at api.jquerymobile.com ... that's bad. Global configuration values should be there.
[05:28:38] <uGoMobi> now I know why I didn't know about this config ;)
[05:28:50] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I type mobileinit into search and I get button widget?
[05:29:59] <_|Nix|_> OK, so a lot of default options are being set in mobileinit, which explains why so many pages refer to it.
[05:30:23] <_|Nix|_> mobileinit itself is not documented under events.
[05:30:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont think there is a global config option for that i think you might be thinking of minScrollBack
[05:31:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, the scroll cannot be prevented?
[05:32:09] <arschmitz> im looking to see if there is a way right now
[05:32:15] <arschmitz> but its not a config i dont think
[05:32:35] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15alebedev opened issue #5652: Hidden panels should have display: none  02http://git.io/sWWJbg
[05:35:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: js/jquery.mobile.init.js:157 is my bet.
[05:37:06] <arschmitz> yup
[05:37:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's pretty brutal though - I'd overwrite $.mobile.silentScroll with my own function that ignores the first call and passes through subsequent calls.
[05:37:59] <arschmitz> yeah i think thats the only way really
[05:38:04] <arschmitz> this really should be an option
[05:38:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[05:38:56] * _|Nix|_ goes sifting through his closet ... where the heck is that sledgehammer?
[05:39:17] <arschmitz> lol so many things to fix for 1.4
[05:39:51] <arschmitz> page.sections was annoying me this weekend

[05:41:10] <toddmparker___> _|Nix|_: this isn't scrollback
[05:42:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: only way to not hide url bar is over write the silent scroll function
[05:43:40] <toddmparker___> this it's this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L130
[05:43:45] <toddmparker___> yuck
[05:44:09] <arschmitz> yup only way would be to over write to ignore first call
[05:44:22] <toddmparker___> if this isn't configurable, we can skip it
[05:44:22] <arschmitz> because its very needed after that of course
[05:44:35] <toddmparker___> that should be a config option
[05:44:36] <arschmitz> yeah it really should be config but its not :(
[05:44:42] <toddmparker___> +1
[05:44:49] <toddmparker___> nevermind. carry on
[05:44:55] <arschmitz> lol
[05:45:09] <toddmparker___> gotta step away to get ready for work
[05:45:22] <toddmparker___> what is the plan for the zip
[05:45:53] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: havent talked to uGoMobi: yet but im thinking we just need to not support zip with out server for this release
[05:46:10] <arschmitz> fix in 1.3.1
[05:46:44] <toddmparker___> so don't do much
[05:46:51] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:47:04] <toddmparker___> i'd like to do a test deploy as soon as we can today to see if there are issues
[05:47:08] <arschmitz> i think we just dont have the time to do anything about it
[05:47:10] <toddmparker___> we normally do this 
[05:47:45] <arschmitz> we will need to get johnbender: or gseguin: to deploy
[05:47:46] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: for the site search, how hard would it be to add in arrow up/down support for the list of results?
[05:48:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: what do you mean like to scroll the list?
[05:48:13] <_|Nix|_> OK. So, I'm not gonna keep trying.
[05:48:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: BTW: Ignoring the first call is not enough :/
[05:48:33] <arschmitz> oh yeah
[05:48:39] <arschmitz> it has to happen on every transition
[05:48:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: like this search http://www.imdb.com/
[05:49:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... attemping this without changes to the lib would be insanity.
[05:49:09] <uGoMobi> you can nav thru results with keyboard
[05:49:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toddmparker___: him let me think about it for a bit 
[05:49:48] <arschmitz> i think it should be doable though
[05:50:13] <arschmitz> its just focus basicly
[05:50:32] <toddmparker___> _|Nix|_: yeah, skip it
[05:50:41] <uGoMobi> about the zip... can we generate a new one between releases?
[05:50:57] <uGoMobi> and replace the download on the site
[05:51:25] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: as in update the 1.3.0 zip later?
[05:51:46] <toddmparker___> we can if we have to but we onnly do it if bad bugs
[05:51:47] <uGoMobi> yes
[05:51:59] <arschmitz> yeah im thinking its not a good idea
[05:52:04] <toddmparker___> we do a test deploy ahead of the release to make sure the ip and cdn links look ok
[05:52:08] <uGoMobi> just the demos in the zip I thought
[05:52:18] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:52:25] <toddmparker___> brb
[05:52:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: related ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2580
[05:53:25] <uGoMobi> for some reason gseguin|away was not in favor of setting focus on first list item on enter / arrow down key
[05:53:28] <uGoMobi> dunno why
[05:54:31] <toddmparker> Yeah?
[05:54:52] <toddmparker> In demos, we can 
[05:55:02] <toddmparker> Curious about that 
[05:55:13] <arschmitz> yeah not sure why that would be bad?
[05:55:18] <arschmitz> its pretty common

[06:20:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: tell me

[06:20:14] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14508f56a 15Jasper de Groot: Demos: fixes jump when close global nav panel on iOS
[06:20:21] <arschmitz> type just the letter f
[06:20:36] <uGoMobi> done
[06:20:50] <arschmitz> accordion and autocomplete and buttons .... all show
[06:21:10] <uGoMobi> yup
[06:21:17] <arschmitz> they dont contain f
[06:21:34] <uGoMobi> but... it's smart search :)
[06:21:45] <uGoMobi> I added filter text to all menus
[06:21:59] <uGoMobi> search footer and you see navbar too
[06:22:28] <uGoMobi> see the nav-widget.php etc. files
[06:22:29] <arschmitz> hmm ok just does not seem right
[06:22:35] <arschmitz> yeah i see it now 
[06:22:47] <arschmitz> still does not seem right though lol
[06:23:04] <uGoMobi> depends
[06:23:31] <uGoMobi> if you search "collapsible set" you will be probably be happy that "accordion" shows up too
[06:23:39] <arschmitz> yes
[06:23:45] <uGoMobi> not saying that the filter text is perfect
[06:23:46] <arschmitz> it makes sense with longer strings
[06:24:01] <arschmitz> but with short strings it makes it just seem broken
[06:24:08] <uGoMobi> so there is certainly room for improvement
[06:24:47] <arschmitz> seems like we should have a search page that would show results if you hit enter too and then maybe have it only autocomplete on 3+ characters
[06:24:51] <uGoMobi> the faq pages now just have the title as filter text
[06:25:13] <uGoMobi> but want to add the features that it adresses in there
[06:25:19] <arschmitz> stuff to look at in the future i guess lol
[06:25:51] <uGoMobi> yeah we could change it so it only shows results after 3 chars
[06:25:59] <uGoMobi> code for that is in the autocomplete demo
[06:26:17] <arschmitz> yeah wouldnt want to unless its going to have a search button that takes you to a results page though
[06:26:33] <uGoMobi> search results page would be nice in the future but bit more complicated
[06:26:39] <arschmitz> because other wise when nothing happens for first couple characters it will seem non functional
[06:26:41] <uGoMobi> would be cool though
[06:27:07] <uGoMobi> true
[06:27:18] <arschmitz> for now i think best to keep as is something we should address in future
[06:27:23] <uGoMobi> so we have to add those two together
[06:27:30] <arschmitz> yup
[06:27:31] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:27:52] <arschmitz> i can make a results page easy
[06:27:58] <arschmitz> but probably not today lol
[06:28:08] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:28:39] <arschmitz> working for a car dealership i do a lot of search results stuff lol so it should not be a problem to whip something up
[06:28:52] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:29:02] <uGoMobi> would be cool demo
[06:29:12] <arschmitz> hmm actually i have an idea to do this super super fast
[06:29:22] <arschmitz> this might be doable right now
[06:29:38] <uGoMobi> I think at some point we should add "the making of" :)
[06:29:43] <arschmitz> lol
[06:29:47] <uGoMobi> go for it
[06:30:03] <arschmitz> we can do one of those cheesy web films
[06:30:20] <arschmitz> do it in the style of like the office
[06:30:26] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:30:30] <uGoMobi> would be fun
[06:30:35] <arschmitz> for sure
[06:30:49] <arschmitz> hey didnt todd mention we have a budget for a team get together this year lol
[06:32:23] <uGoMobi> I guess we will meet up in hollywood then
[06:32:36] <uGoMobi> or maybe bollywood, india :)

[06:45:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: got a working results page :)
[06:45:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool
[06:46:29] <arschmitz> ill fix it up a little then we will have to change the search filter to actually submit to the page
[06:47:05] <toddmparker> What do you see on the results page?
[06:47:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker: its just making it so the search at the top actually submits to a page if you hit enter PE :)
[06:48:01] <toddmparker> Cool
[06:48:06] <arschmitz> so its the same as the autocomplete shows already
[06:48:10] <toddmparker> +1
[06:48:34] <arschmitz> also makes it so we can make it only auto complete after 3+ characters are entered
[06:48:46] <arschmitz> because right now if you just type in f into the search
[06:48:53] <arschmitz> it makes no sense the results you see
[06:49:09] <toddmparker> One option is to append the relevant filter text node on gray after the item text
[06:49:30] <toddmparker> Accordion - grouped collapsible
[06:49:31] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I thought about that
[06:49:42] <toddmparker> If I was typing in collap...
[06:49:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: but the way filter works makes that you need to put some strange strings in
[06:50:19] <toddmparker> Ah. Ok
[06:50:35] <uGoMobi> "selectmenus custom select menus native selects multiple selects forms"
[06:50:38] <toddmparker> Don't think this is a big deal
[06:50:42] <toddmparker> Works for me
[06:50:43] <uGoMobi> that's the filter text for select
[06:50:52] <toddmparker> Right
[06:51:25] <uGoMobi> that is so it matches all different names that are used
[06:51:36] <uGoMobi> singular and plural
[06:52:02] <uGoMobi> but we can look at how to improve this later
[06:53:10] <toddmparker> Sure
[06:54:03] <toddmparker> Get fancy and use the li string for the first 2-3 letter then use the deeper search 
[06:54:47] <toddmparker> Would fix the "I typed B and get results that don't have B"
[06:54:55] <uGoMobi> cool idea.. we have the listview before filter event
[06:55:26] <toddmparker> Nice
[06:55:39] <toddmparker> Not a fan of waiting for x characters
[06:55:46] <toddmparker> Feels slow 
[06:55:59] <arschmitz> yeah i like that
[06:58:19] <toddmparker> On desktop, the arrow keys will be the biggest win
[06:58:30] <toddmparker> Train here, brb
[06:59:36] <uGoMobi> we def need to add that to the framework in 1.4
[07:05:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i could use some css love on this in a few minutes
[07:06:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[07:06:30] <uGoMobi> looking at the width of the search list now
[07:06:34] <arschmitz> im just going to make it functional and then let you style the added submit button
[07:06:42] <uGoMobi> want to give a bit more space
[07:06:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[07:11:32] <toddmparker> Hey
[07:12:18] <toddmparker> Is the idea to have the submit button in the markup and hide it if you get the enhanced experience?
[07:13:33] <arschmitz> not sure either way works
[07:13:55] <arschmitz> if its there it should be a small icon only button
[07:16:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ^^
[07:16:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi??
[07:17:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry, IRC delay
[07:17:46] <arschmitz> oh ok
[07:18:32] <toddmparker> If the results page doesn't offer much additional content than the autocomplete, seems like its great for pe
[07:18:50] <uGoMobi> maybe do something with the search icon in front of the text? 
[07:18:54] <toddmparker> But you may not need to go there if you have JS 
[07:19:11] <uGoMobi> search icon, submit button and clear button is a bit much
[07:19:35] <toddmparker> But if we keep it, it may make sense as a small button after the input with search icon and text
[07:19:47] <toddmparker> To differentiate it from the x button
[07:20:08] <toddmparker> Double button
[07:20:09] <arschmitz> and i know a lot of people that ignore auto complete all together
[07:20:16] <arschmitz> and just want results
[07:20:36] <arschmitz> but either way
[07:20:43] <uGoMobi> I can hide the search icon in front of the text
[07:21:09] <uGoMobi> and add the submit button with the icon 
[07:21:46] <gseguin> mornin' all
[07:21:59] <gseguin> did you guys get a hold of Bender?
[07:22:00] <arschmitz> morning gseguin
[07:22:19] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I don't remember about that list item focus thing
[07:22:42] <gseguin> are we still releasing today?
[07:22:47] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I do :)
[07:32:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: are we disableing ajax nav globaly or not?
[07:32:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not yet.. view source doesn't work
[07:32:32] <arschmitz> i thought _|Nix|_ fixed it again this morning?
[07:32:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah wait
[07:33:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that must be why I thought the fix didn't work
[07:33:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it was in wrong folder
[07:33:33] <uGoMobi> will test again
[07:38:58] <toddmparker> gseguin: lots of moving pieces so it's unclear. i'd like to release later today

[07:40:13] <toddmparker> let's make a list, shall we?

[08:16:17] <arschmitz> it does not link at all
[08:16:48] <arschmitz> its just an image no link
[08:17:03] <arschmitz> oh never mind
[08:17:11] <uGoMobi> only on homepage
[08:17:17] <arschmitz> yeah realized
[08:17:22] <uGoMobi> :)
[08:17:37] <arschmitz> and on search results i copied header from home page and thats page i was on so ill fix that

[08:21:49] <arschmitz> going to work on arrow key for list now
[08:24:19] <toddmparker> arschmitz: great

[08:25:18] <toddmparker> i think i'd vote to use the results as a fallback for now since it's the same content as the autocomplete  - that sound ok?
[08:25:43] <toddmparker> if it has abstracts or keyword highlighting or other, additional content, that makes sense
[08:26:07] <toddmparker> to go there
[08:26:29] <toddmparker> the X and > buttons side-by-side is going to messy
[08:26:51] <toddmparker> just my opinion
[08:30:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i dont think a button is needed but it should go on enter key no matter what i think
[08:30:59] <arschmitz> toddmparke: i think we should add abstracts and maybe highlighting though
[08:31:03] <arschmitz> that would be super awesome
[08:31:23] <arschmitz> if i can get arrow keys working ill work on that next
[08:31:31] <toddmparker> agree on enter
[08:31:44] <toddmparker> problem is there really aren't abstracts
[08:32:02] <toddmparker> we're faking this by loading up the hidden filter data with keywords
[08:32:11] <arschmitz> maybe add the filter text as fine print? keyworkds: filter text type deal
[08:32:12] <toddmparker> not parsing the pages
[08:32:36] <toddmparker> arschmitz: be worth looking at as an enhancement for sure
[08:32:46] <toddmparker> would help with the "why is this matching?" question
[08:32:51] <arschmitz> yup
[08:33:04] <arschmitz> and have it highlight any matching text
[08:33:19] <toddmparker> right
[08:33:31] <arschmitz> ok arrow keys first then that
[08:33:41] <toddmparker> yeah, great
[08:33:50] <arschmitz> arrow keys is harder then it should be
[08:33:54] <toddmparker> think this is launch-worthy
[08:34:13] <arschmitz> because we filter oppsisit we add the class to hidden not to shown lol
[08:34:25] <arschmitz> so selecting the right item to highlight is hard
[08:34:40] <toddmparker> right

[08:38:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: BTW - can you confirm the jump when closing global nav panel is gone on iPhone?
[08:39:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: arschmitz : are we going to remove the submit button for search?
[08:39:43] <arschmitz> unless you can make it look good we should
[08:39:56] <arschmitz> if you can make it look good i think it should stay but i think that will be hard
[08:41:51] <uGoMobi> on phones there will be big chance you click the wrong button if they are next to eachother
[08:42:09] <uGoMobi> I think it's pretty common to press enter/go
[08:43:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: divider bg color is still bit an issue. I don't see difference with list item anymore on my screen. 
[08:43:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: how about green font for the dividers?
[08:44:00] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: let's hide the button
[08:44:14] <toddmparker> we can try that. i had 'em green last night at one point
[08:44:23] <toddmparker> doesn't work on gray well
[08:44:25] <uGoMobi> no good?
[08:44:28] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[08:44:35] <toddmparker> lemme try again
[08:44:48] <uGoMobi> maybe we need some blue :)
[08:45:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: should I hide the submit button with CSS or should we comment it out in JS?
[08:46:04] <arschmitz> hmm its dyanmicly added and need for enter key to work
[08:46:12] <arschmitz> so i think we need to do visibility hidden
[08:46:27] <toddmparker> visibly hidden
[08:46:29] <arschmitz> for PE it should be in js i think so when js no avalible it will show
[08:46:47] <toddmparker> add that classs via js?
[08:48:49] <arschmitz> dont we have a class accessibly hiding stuff?

[09:59:18] <arschmitz> for the highlight?
[09:59:25] <toddmparker> be cool to use the same active state as the menus
[09:59:26] <toddmparker> ya
[09:59:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK. I'll keep copy editing 'til I drop (or I get a priority interrupt from family).
[09:59:35] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: cool
[09:59:40] <arschmitz> im just using ui-btn-up-b
[09:59:52] <arschmitz> we can change to whatever
[10:00:01] <toddmparker> lemme look
[10:00:35] <uGoMobi> i think we override the global active state in demos css
[10:01:03] <uGoMobi> so if the list has theme "d" and you add active class it should get same style
[10:01:06] <arschmitz> test/ is behind and not showing yet too many commits for it too keep up :)

[10:05:56] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: can you look at why the arrow key style on the autocomplete isn't getting the lighter blue and right font?
[10:06:03] <toddmparker> too many damn classes
[10:06:15] <toddmparker> yeah, i can tone that down
[10:06:20] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: sure

[10:06:38] <toddmparker> arschmitz: unless you're looking at that

[10:06:44] <toddmparker> logo color
[10:06:48] <toddmparker> ah
[10:06:53] <toddmparker> maybe that's it
[10:06:55] <toddmparker> der
[10:07:06] <_|Nix|_> docs/widgets/pages/index.php starts kind of abruptly: "The header is a toolbar at the top of the page"
[10:07:32] <_|Nix|_> It should be about pages, not the header.
[10:07:41] <_|Nix|_> Not sure how to fix that immediately.
[10:07:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you want to look at dynamic controlgroup checkbox enhancement issue?
[10:08:06] <uGoMobi> I can look at that page header
[10:08:13] <uGoMobi> switch jobs :)
[10:08:25] <uGoMobi> let me push the demo
[10:08:25] <mfranz> This may be a silly question, but are there any issues with jQuery-mobile rendering correctly using a normal computer desktop browser?  I am just wondering since I am looking to write an application to be used mostly on a mobile device but occationally may need to be used in a desktop environment
[10:08:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not the header. It's the text that talks about headers. It should be talking about pages.

[10:18:36] <arschmitz> kinda weird how it stays open forever

[13:31:23] <agcolom> but view source and it's all there!
[13:32:24] <agcolom> Can anyone paste http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/widgets/collapsibles/ into the address bar in Safari?
[13:32:32] <uGoMobi> gnarf: I think it's ok if master says "version dev"
[13:33:37] <gnarf> uGoMobi: even 1.2-stable says that... http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/
[13:33:41] <uGoMobi> the view at a tag like view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0 should show the version though
[13:33:54] <gnarf> dunno what needs to happen to make that work

[13:50:32] <toddmparker> anyone seeing random spot where the logo doesn't load?

[13:51:05] <toddmparker> on localhost

[13:51:17] <uGoMobi> no not local
[13:51:23] <uGoMobi> on view
[13:51:43] <toddmparker> view. is crazy slow to load - gnarf, is that normal?
[13:51:59] <gnarf> view.* runs on the same server builder was on

[13:55:39] <toddmparker> it's sporadic
[13:56:25] <toddmparker> Q: uGoMobi or arschmitz  - would it be possible to close the panel when you click a link? right now, it stays open during the transition
[13:56:50] <arschmitz> which panel?
[13:56:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, I saw that too
[13:56:59] <uGoMobi> global nav
[13:57:04] <toddmparker> the demo led nav
[13:57:06] <toddmparker> ya
[13:57:12] <toddmparker> feels odd for some reason
[13:57:15] <uGoMobi> we have to change that in the framework for 1.3.1
[13:57:25] <toddmparker> want it to close while i watch the loader
[13:57:31] <toddmparker> i see
[13:57:40] <uGoMobi> we changed it from pagebeforehide to pagehide
[13:57:50] <toddmparker> gotcha
[13:57:54] <uGoMobi> but that was before I changed the logic
[13:58:03] <uGoMobi> I think we should change it back
[13:58:19] <toddmparker> we could probably make that change
[13:58:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I will see if I can fix it in docs JS now
[13:58:29] <toddmparker> be a pain to change the behavior
[13:59:45] <uGoMobi> best would be if page transition doesn't start before panel completely closed
[14:00:06] <toddmparker> true
[14:00:43] <uGoMobi> I remember we had an issue before with completely blank pages on FF or Safari
[14:00:49] <uGoMobi> long time ago
[14:01:01] <uGoMobi> have to see what's going on
[14:01:30] <uGoMobi> I look the safari issue first now, after that panel close
[14:02:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you have time to look at the checkboxes in this demo http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/examples/controlgroups/dynamic-controlgroup.php ?

[14:23:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: what's difference between your Safari and toddmparker's
[14:24:03] <agcolom> My one is older
[14:24:42] <agcolom> I have another mac somewhere I could try as well.
[14:25:01] <agcolom> On that one I must have a version that between my version and Todd's
[14:26:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: were you ever able to load pages with panel on that Mac?
[14:26:58] <uGoMobi> in old docs
[14:27:56] <uGoMobi> http://view.jquerymobile.com/old-docs/docs/panels/index.html
[14:28:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that page loads on safari/win
[14:28:35] <agcolom>  yes, panels work normally on that safari 
[14:28:42] <uGoMobi> so, no longer framework bug
[14:29:02] <agcolom> that page works fine
[14:31:45] <agcolom> uGoMobi: the problem is with ui-panel-content-wrap ui-body-c ui-panel-animate ui-panel-content-wrap-closed
[14:32:10] <agcolom> that is not on the pages that work I think
[14:32:43] <uGoMobi> it should be
[14:32:53] <agcolom> ok, let me check...
[14:33:01] <uGoMobi> we always wrap the whole page contents if there is a panel on the page
[14:33:32] <agcolom> no, it's not
[14:33:51] <agcolom> so on a page that work, we have panel and then
[14:34:07] <agcolom> <div class="ui-panel-inner">
[14:35:35] <agcolom> on the one which breaks on Safari, we have the same, but then it's followed by <div class="ui-panel-content-wrap ui-body-c ui-panel-animate ui-panel-content-wrap-closed">
[14:36:30] <uGoMobi> followed by.. as sibling you mean?
[14:37:37] <agcolom> ok, on the page that work that <div class="ui-panel-content-wrap  is a sibling of header
[14:37:44] <agcolom> and appears after header
[14:38:23] <agcolom> it contains and header and a footer

[14:38:57] <agcolom> it is also a sibling of panel
[14:39:07] <agcolom> Now on the one that does not work...
[14:40:41] <agcolom> it's the same but it also contains a content
[14:40:52] <agcolom> ok, I'm checking again...
[14:41:35] <uGoMobi> agcolom: can you pass the links of the pages that you test so I can inspect the same code?
[14:41:47] <agcolom> http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/widgets/collapsibles/
[14:41:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we broke this with the performance improvements.
[14:42:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: aii
[14:42:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: buttonMarkup needs to be fixed.
[14:42:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ^
[14:42:27] <_|Nix|_> I have the fix.
[14:42:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: When a buttonMarkup option is set to null, it ends up as data-option="null" which is read back and ends up in a className.
[14:44:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So we need to if ( o[ key ] === null || o[ key ] === undefined ) { el.removeAttr( key ); } else e.setAttribute( "data-" + key, o[ key ] ); }
[14:44:36] <toddmparker> hrm
[14:44:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can work around it by explicitly setting iconpos to the default value.
[14:44:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see
[14:45:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Haven't tested that workaround though.
[14:45:16] <toddmparker> so pages not rendering are related to button markup?
[14:45:24] <uGoMobi> null is not threated same as undefined?
[14:45:24] <toddmparker> sorry, catching up
[14:45:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no, two different issues
[14:45:47] <uGoMobi> not related
[14:45:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It is, but it's also treated the same as false, so we need to enumerate them both.
[14:46:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I need to check why non-dynamically created checkboxes seem to be fine.
[14:46:07] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: _|Nix|_ is talking about the icon of checkboxes in this demo http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/examples/controlgroups/dynamic-controlgroup.php
[14:46:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the safari issue is with panels
[14:46:35] <uGoMobi> 3D-ing
[14:46:42] <toddmparker> ok, sorry. hard to parse irc after the fact
[14:46:47] <toddmparker> figures
[14:47:05] <uGoMobi> but only in new demos, not on the old docs panel page
[14:48:22] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Actually the only difference I can spot is that the page that works had a header. 
[14:48:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: does this page work or not work? http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/widgets/collapsibles/
[14:49:25] <agcolom> does not work
[14:49:32] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:49:49] <uGoMobi> that page has a header too, just styled different
[14:50:50] <agcolom> on the page that doesn't work, the panel has a header
[14:51:14] <uGoMobi> huh
[14:51:19] <uGoMobi> what page is that?
[14:51:40] <agcolom> uGoMobi: that page you got me to check the header is in the panel 
[14:52:00] <uGoMobi> this one http://view.jquerymobile.com/old-docs/docs/panels/index.html
[14:52:19] <uGoMobi> you see the header inside the panel?
[14:53:08] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1363: NOW UNSTABLE in 14 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1363/
[14:54:05] <agcolom> on  http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/widgets/collapsibles/ I see the header in <div class="ui-panel-content-wrap ui-body-c ui-panel-animate ui-panel-content-wrap-closed">
[14:54:24] <agcolom> On that page I don't see a header as a child of page
[14:54:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes that's correct
[14:54:45] <uGoMobi> header content footer are all wrapped in ui-panel-content-wrap
[14:54:56] <uGoMobi> unless it's fixed header or footer
[14:55:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I can reproduce the issue on safari/win
[14:55:22] <agcolom> on http://view.jquerymobile.com/old-docs/docs/panels/index.html it work and the header is a child of page
[14:55:39] <uGoMobi> it's is the 3D-ing we use to trigger hardware accel
[14:56:00] <uGoMobi> and if it happends or not depends on the page length
[14:56:07] <uGoMobi> short pages will work
[14:56:12] <agcolom> ok
[14:56:12] <uGoMobi> long pages crash
[14:56:35] <agcolom> but http://view.jquerymobile.com/old-docs/docs/panels/index.html is a long page and it works
[14:56:49] <uGoMobi> good point
[14:56:56] <_|Nix|_> OK. This is bad.
[14:56:57] <_|Nix|_> 	<label for="theCheckbox">Checkbox</label>
[14:56:57] <_|Nix|_> 	<input id="theCheckbox" name="theCheckbox" type="checkbox"></input>
[14:57:04] <_|Nix|_> Results in a broken checkbox.
[14:57:09] <uGoMobi> agcolom: maybe it's when there are many widgets on the page
[14:57:21] <uGoMobi> many stuff that needs to be enhanced
[14:57:29] <agcolom> uGoMobi: so you don't think it could be the header?
[14:57:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I doubt it
[14:58:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the reason why the header is a child of page is because we use a fixed header there
[14:58:26] <_|Nix|_> http://jsbin.com/onibuc/238/
[14:58:29] <agcolom> I've had a bug on my html 5 slides with i frames when I didn't have both header and footer so that's why I think we could try to investigate
[14:58:35] <_|Nix|_> I'd say this is a showstopper.
[14:59:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: http://jsbin.com/onibuc/238/edit - showstopper, IMO.
[14:59:19] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Can we try to pull the header out of the ui-panel-content-wrap and see if that fixes it?
[14:59:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think? http://jsbin.com/onibuc/238/edit
[15:00:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that would mean we have to rewrite the panel widget completely
[15:00:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  :'(
[15:00:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... if you specify data-iconpos="left" by hand, it works.
[15:01:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but I am going to investigate if there is a relation between having the header wrapped or not and the blank page
[15:02:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: works here http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/widgets/checkbox/
[15:02:43] <uGoMobi> Icon position section
[15:03:19] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/onibuc/239/edit

[15:03:28] <agcolom> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_ 
[15:03:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so it's only when you set it programmatically?
[15:04:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hey what did you do/
[15:04:01] <uGoMobi> ?
[15:04:07] <uGoMobi> to fix it
[15:04:13] <agcolom> needs a form tag input is an empty tage
[15:04:16] <agcolom> tag
[15:04:27] <uGoMobi> aha
[15:04:32] <agcolom> and remove empty iconpos
[15:04:52] <uGoMobi> yeah inputs should be in a form
[15:04:58] <uGoMobi> nice
[15:05:03] <agcolom> :-)
[15:05:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no showstopper

[15:05:12] <uGoMobi> THE SHOW MUST GO ON
[15:05:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono. If you create a simple checkbox, it will be broken, unless you also add data-iconpos="left" or "right"
[15:06:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's a regression, too.
[15:06:20] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/onibuc/239/edit I don't data-iconpos
[15:06:29] <uGoMobi> don't see*
[15:06:42] <agcolom> Yeah I removed iconpos
[15:07:09] <uGoMobi> it only requires form
[15:08:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Weird. It's broken in Chrome on Linux, but not FF.
[15:08:53] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: It's fine in Safari too 
[15:08:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So that points to different behaviour when it comes to setAttribute: Chrome will stringify, whereas FF will not.
[15:09:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe it's a bug in Chrome.
[15:09:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: works on Chrome for me
[15:09:40] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/dd1930dff637cae1987bd4aef61002fbcb15c961
[15:09:40] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14dd1930d 15Jasper de Groot: Demos: fixed controlgroup demo
[15:09:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno what the spec says about having setting an attribute value of null.
[15:10:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I dunno either and this is still something to look at
[15:10:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but those dynamic checkboxes /are/ broken. So there are instances where data-iconpos can end up having a value of "null"
[15:10:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just fixed them
[15:10:59] <uGoMobi> by wrapping the controlgroup div in form tags
[15:11:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, that's exceedingly weird.
[15:11:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it sure is
[15:12:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe inside a form the properties behave differently.
[15:12:20] <uGoMobi> but agcolom is right that inputs are supposed to be in a form
[15:12:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Outside a form, an input is just a div, but inside a form, it has special powers.
[15:12:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I have to read the specs
[15:12:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For sure.
[15:12:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll merge the pull request after 1.3.0.
[15:13:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great
[15:13:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We should never, under any circumstances, allow options.x = null to turn into data-x="null".
[15:13:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am glad it isn't as bad as we thought
[15:13:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: very true
[15:14:23] <_|Nix|_> null or undefined means "I don't want this option to be present at all".
[15:14:37] <uGoMobi> and false
[15:14:42] <_|Nix|_> No!
[15:14:56] <_|Nix|_> false means "I want this option to be present and set to false or "false".
[15:15:01] <uGoMobi> ok bit different
[15:15:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, data-corners="false"
[15:15:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In JS, that's options.corners = false;
[15:15:27] <uGoMobi> yeah you are right... it's value but a bool no string
[15:15:41] <uGoMobi> null and undefined are not
[15:15:45] <_|Nix|_> Exactly.
[15:16:13] <_|Nix|_> getAttribute() works like that: If you attempt to getAttribute( "foo" ) when the element has no "foo" attribute, it returns null.
[15:16:23] <uGoMobi> just mentioned it because I noticed issue in listview where false isn't always threated as it supposed to
[15:16:28] <_|Nix|_> So null means has-no-"foo"-attribute.
[15:16:52] <uGoMobi> I see the difference
[15:16:54] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, that seems to be a perennial JS problem.
[15:17:06] <_|Nix|_> JS has so many ways to say no - it's no fun.
[15:17:13] <_|Nix|_> Arrrgh!
[15:17:23] <_|Nix|_> The punniness is overwhelming.
[15:17:28] <uGoMobi> :)
[15:17:41] <uGoMobi> TRUE
[15:17:48] <_|Nix|_> LOL :)
[15:21:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: What do you think about adding commas to filter text
[15:21:21] <arschmitz> Will make keywords make a lot more sense 
[15:21:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the point is that filter only looks for exact matching strings
[15:22:24] <_|Nix|_> Man, in latest Chrome, jsbin code editor keeps losing focus ...
[15:22:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I have same issue
[15:22:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: have to disable output
[15:23:01] <_|Nix|_> :(

[15:23:41] <uGoMobi> that will match "custom select"
[15:23:46] <uGoMobi> and "select menu"
[15:23:47] <arschmitz> Right I know

[15:24:04] <arschmitz> That's why I said add commas between terms
[15:24:08] <uGoMobi> with commas you have to repeat more ters
[15:24:11] <uGoMobi> terms*
[15:24:35] <arschmitz> Ok
[15:24:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Once https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5648 is in, output will work in FF, and FF doesn't currently lose focus.
[15:24:59] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: re jsbin the same happens in Safari! no good!
[15:25:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yes, but only outside forms, right?
[15:25:35] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: If you stick the input in a form, where it belongs, it works, right?
[15:25:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Riiiight? Please say "right"!
[15:25:59] <uGoMobi> lol
[15:26:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, I wonder about Android 2.3.5 and such ...
[15:26:18] <agcolom> I was talking about the js_bin editor
[15:26:22] <_|Nix|_> *gulp*
[15:26:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, OK ... *whew*
[15:27:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the global nav panel menu gets the keywords too
[15:27:08] <agcolom> so in js_bin, you type one letter and you have to click where you were editing again to be able to type one more letter ,etc...
[15:27:11] <uGoMobi> and highlights
[15:27:28] <arschmitz> I'll fix that
[15:27:57] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: was that what you were talking about?
[15:28:13] <agcolom> (must be a bug in js_bin)
[15:28:17] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I was talking about the fact that checkboxes are broken when you place them outside of a form.
[15:28:37] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The other thing we were talking about is that jsbin keeps losing focus when output is turned on.
[15:28:44] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes they are broken outside of a form, they are fine inside
[15:28:47] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I'm more worried about the former.
[15:29:04] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I hope that's no worse on Android and friends.
[15:29:57] * _|Nix|_ gets ready to stack some browsers.
[15:31:06] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi wait in the api docs, the checkboxes are fine and not in form
[15:31:28] <agcolom> http://api.jquerymobile.com/checkboxradio/
[15:33:19] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Weird ... maybe you don't need a form - maybe a fieldset is enough ... ?
[15:33:35] <uGoMobi> strange indeed
[15:33:53] <_|Nix|_> Yep. fieldset is enough.
[15:34:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, form and fieldset activates their special powers.
[15:34:21] <_|Nix|_> St00pid webkit.
[15:34:31] <uGoMobi> I want to be wrapped in form or fieldset too
[15:34:41] <_|Nix|_> LOL :)
[15:34:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Are you a checkbox?
[15:34:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: y/n?
[15:34:59] <uGoMobi> I can be a checkbox
[15:34:59] <agcolom> this one doesn't have a fieldset: http://api.jquerymobile.com/resources/checkbox/example1.html
[15:35:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Weird ...
[15:37:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What if you change the js to 1.3.0-rc.1?
[15:37:14] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: We may have merged these perf improvements after beta.
[15:37:15] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/onibuc/242
[15:37:52] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yep. Works in beta, broken in RC.
[15:38:01] <agcolom> form removed... uses latest.... works
[15:40:19] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: ^
[15:40:41] <_|Nix|_> Dang nab it!
[15:40:41] <_|Nix|_> This wasn't a problem before we switched to setAttribute because we were using jqmData, and that preserves type.
[15:41:41] <agcolom> It doesn't work inside teh jsbin editor but it works if you view just the output by either going to http://jsbin.com/onibuc/242 directly or opening the output by pressing the small arrow
[15:42:01] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: ^
[15:42:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Looking ...
[15:42:19] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Doesn't work for me.
[15:42:27] <agcolom> really??
[15:42:35] <agcolom> this link? http://jsbin.com/onibuc/242 
[15:42:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks like the highlight is not always working
[15:42:59] <uGoMobi> having problems to remove it too
[15:43:16] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yep. That link. Broken on Android 2.3 as well.
[15:43:38] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes work on FF, broken on Safari
[15:44:38] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yep.
[15:44:47] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: webkit stringifies ...
[15:44:47] <agcolom> So we have a problem!
[15:45:03] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Not really. Inputs are not supposed to be used outside forms or fieldsets.
[15:45:36] <agcolom> ok, So I need to fix the docs because they'll get broken... 
[15:46:35] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I guess - if we have non-wrapped checkboxradio widgets.

[16:09:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: although I override overflow setting for the page in the demos CSS
[16:09:55] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: L8R
[16:10:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe an animationComplete() handler isn't firing ...
[16:10:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: When the panel closes in FF, the closing animation is absent. It closes instantly.
[16:11:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but then it shouldn't work here either http://view.jquerymobile.com/old-docs/docs/panels/index.html
[16:11:21] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1365: STILL UNSTABLE in 13 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1365/
[16:11:37] <uGoMobi> that old-docs branch is made after RC1
[16:12:03] <_|Nix|_> OK ... how do I add a JS breakpoint in FF?
[16:12:49] <toddmparker> Hi all - sorry, got pulled into a meeting
[16:16:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, buttonMarkup is safe, although I made a PR we should merge right after the release.
[16:16:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and things still break, but checkboxes and/or radios must be outside of a form or a fieldset for them to be broken on webkit.
[16:17:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... so that should limit the damage.
[16:18:04] <toddmparker> If you use a firm
[16:18:06] <toddmparker> Form
[16:18:23] <toddmparker> Element outside a form = NO
[16:18:28] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker: gotta make sure that form is firm
[16:18:29] <toddmparker> :)
[16:18:38] <toddmparker> autocorrect
[16:18:46] <toddmparker> Tunnel, gonna drop
[16:20:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah ... if checkboxes venture outside of forms/fieldsets, their appearance will instantly deteriorate.
[16:21:43] <_|Nix|_> OK the panel doesn't clean up after itself.
[16:22:51] <_|Nix|_> ... aaaand I'm gone. L8R all!
[16:27:33] <_|Nix|_> http://http://enyojs.com/ ... logo remarkably similar to ours.
[16:28:33] <uGoMobi> good night _|Nix|_ 
[16:32:17] <_|Nix|_> Dang! That enyo looks slick! We might be out of a job.
[16:36:20] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: Go here - http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/widgets/popup/#Form&ui-state=dialog
[16:36:53] <toddmparker> The popup page, login firm example
[16:37:01] <toddmparker> Opens then closes
[16:37:59] <toddmparker> iPhone 5
[16:39:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: BTW: Given your link above it doesn't open at all. However, if I strip off the hash, it works on desktop.
[16:39:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Gonna stack on over to iOS 5 ... 
[16:39:43] <toddmparker> Ok
[16:39:54] <toddmparker> Opens halfway
[16:40:05] <toddmparker> Great on desktop
[16:40:24] <toddmparker> Maybe the transition type 
[16:41:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah - try fade.
[16:42:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK ... on browserstack it doesn't open at all  ...
[16:42:47] <toddmparker> Huh
[16:42:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... then, when I click on the page it appears and disappears.
[16:42:57] <toddmparker> Yar
[16:43:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm gonna have a great deal of fun debugging this tomorrow :/
[16:43:22] <toddmparker> Heh
[16:43:40] <toddmparker> Focus related?
[16:44:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The flip transition seems broken.
[16:44:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Try it from the transition examples further down.
[16:44:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So is "turn".
[16:44:49] <toddmparker> Hmm
[16:45:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The rest are fine-ish.
[16:45:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: AFAICT from the simulator.
[16:45:55] <_|Nix|_> ... but now I'm really going to bed ... L8R all!
[16:46:17] <uGoMobi> later _|Nix|_ 
[16:49:10] <uGoMobi> I am off to bed too
[16:49:14] <uGoMobi> good night all
[17:07:37] <toddmparker> Goodnight
