[05:24:06] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: 
[05:30:17] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:30:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will take a look at that JS Bin
[05:31:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[05:32:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Could you please also review https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5337?
[05:32:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's about adding the active state to forms.
[05:32:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: will do
[05:32:54] <_|Nix|_> Awesome! In the meantime, I've discovered a bug in core git: $( "<div></div>" ).addClass( "my-class" ).removeClass( "my-class" ) === "<div class></div>"
[05:33:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it does that with all properties i think its intentional
[05:34:03] <arschmitz> or attributes rather
[05:34:21] <arschmitz> if you remove everything it leaves it like that css will do the same
[05:34:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It didn't before recently.
[05:35:01] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm i thought it had for quite a while now but i could be crazy lol
[05:36:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, the git build broke, like, Nov 27, 2012 2:00:48 AM ...
[05:37:06] <arschmitz> weird maybe it only did it with certain things like css before
[05:37:16] <arschmitz> because i know 100% iv seen it before
[05:37:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it might've started doing that with class as well ...
[05:38:08] <arschmitz> they probably changed for consistancy or something lol
[05:38:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: when you have a sec i rewrote the swipe event a bit last night to allow it to be extended. to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2328
[05:39:14] <arschmitz> if you could take a look it would be cool
[05:44:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are you talking about https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/commit/02f332bb38bd09de746ca1d4da64c922c3845061?
[05:44:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ that would be the one lol i was just getting the link lol
[05:45:16] <arschmitz> it dosent fix the issue directly but it allows this https://github.com/arschmitz/JQM-Swipefix/blob/master/swipefix.js
[05:45:50] <arschmitz> for people who dont mind the performance hit of calculating offset at the start and end of every touch 
[05:47:02] <arschmitz> makes it so swipe can also be extended to do things like swipeup swipe done swipe diagnol or whatever crazyness you care to dream up
[05:47:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I looked at it ... looks ok ... didn't test it though with actual swipes.
[05:47:55] <arschmitz> i did on iphone didnt test android yet 
[05:48:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[05:48:04] <arschmitz> and i ran the tests and everything passes
[05:48:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it dosent really change anything it really just re organizes it so start stop and handleSwipe can be altered 
[05:51:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I see that. It exposes those parts of the code.
[05:51:59] <arschmitz> yup
[05:54:14] <arschmitz> if we land this then we can just link to that extension and close the issue
[06:04:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the problem with scrollbar in the dialog is only with the custom select, not an issue with the native select
[06:04:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's caused by the hidden elements but I have no idea why... yet
[06:05:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Weird ... they shouldn't be taking up any room ...
[06:06:59] <uGoMobi> exactly
[06:12:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wonder if it's happening on FF as well ...
[06:12:31] <_|Nix|_> Yep ... both FF and Chrome.
[06:14:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah I checked FF too
[06:35:43] <uGoMobi> it was not an issue with 1.2 ... trying to find the difference
[06:37:29] <toddmparker> morning allâ€¦catching up
[06:38:11] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[06:53:17] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker
[06:59:48] <toddmparker> hey guys
[07:00:22] <toddmparker> arschmitz: that swipe stuff looks good. remember to link all that up to the 1.3 change log so we can tout it
[07:00:35] <arschmitz> cool will do
[07:00:43] <toddmparker> is the idea to have the extension as part of the lib or just a demo?
[07:00:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I got it
[07:00:59] <arschmitz> just a demo
[07:01:05] <arschmitz> it has a big performance hit
[07:01:24] <toddmparker> great, i prefer demos = not committing to support
[07:01:41] <arschmitz> i figured we could just give a link to it with a a note about swipe being kinda broken on ios
[07:01:48] <toddmparker> if we land this, we also need to update the API docs
[07:01:51] <arschmitz> but demo works too
[07:01:54] <toddmparker> do you have commit access over there?
[07:01:58] <arschmitz> yes
[07:02:03] <toddmparker> coo
[07:02:05] <toddmparker> l
[07:02:08] <toddmparker> :)
[07:02:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/67e6fbca010bdbd97382f3461ca0ad10d1802814 this commit caused the scrollbar
[07:03:27] <uGoMobi> the usual story... fix one thing, break another
[07:12:24] <toddmparker> yep, such is the way with css
[07:12:30] <toddmparker> untestable, really
[07:13:11] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: when you get a chance, I'd like to look at popup positioningâ€¦seems that the iOS re-position is happening again
[07:13:18] <toddmparker> do you have an iphone/touch?
[07:16:10] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I just nudged Wilto about that regression
[07:16:17] <Wilto> what I do
[07:16:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am testing the original issue now without removing top -9999px
[07:17:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: but maybe Wilto remember something from when he looked into it
[07:17:29] <Wilto> Oh, yeah.
[07:17:38] <Wilto> uGoMobi: The overflow prop was causing it.
[07:17:55] <Wilto> The scrollbar thing isâ€¦ confusing.
[07:18:02] <Wilto> Thatâ€™s what I get for taking a style for granted.
[07:19:53] <uGoMobi> Wilto: it looks like we can add top: -9999px; again
[07:20:02] <Wilto> Yeah; should be fine.
[07:20:02] <uGoMobi> will do some more testing and then commit the change
[07:20:08] <Wilto> Sweet. Thanks, man.

[07:31:20] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 146103ba8 15Jasper de Groot: Selectmenu: prevent horizontal scrollbar on ui-content if only one custom select on the page. Fixes regression from commit 67e6fbc.
[07:32:01] <uGoMobi> err   that should have been vertical scrollbar
[07:49:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker: is this what you had in mind for grouping the range inputs? http://i.imgur.com/79Xxw.jpg
[07:59:58] <toddmparker> arschmitz: i was thinking of two things
[08:00:32] <toddmparker> the first is like you have here, but I don't think we need to merge them like that visually. COuld just be two inputs with a - between 'em
[08:00:43] <arschmitz> ok
[08:01:15] <toddmparker> uGoMobi was working on a presentation that had the slider going full width so the inputs weren't on the same line
[08:01:24] <toddmparker> (I think he was)
[08:01:31] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes
[08:01:43] <arschmitz> ok that i already have i just dont have a demo showing it yet
[08:01:43] <uGoMobi> but not exactly
[08:01:49] <toddmparker> for that, it would be cool to style the inputs so they are a lot more compact and inline, right after the label
[08:02:13] <arschmitz> . have 2 classes you can add .ui-range-top for what your talking about
[08:02:14] <uGoMobi> the idea was... number input + slider together 100% width
[08:03:03] <arschmitz> and ui-range-split to have the inputs be at either end of the slider instead of before
[08:03:31] <toddmparker> i see
[08:03:35] <toddmparker> both seem good
[08:03:38] <toddmparker> ok
[08:04:13] <uGoMobi> in case of new range widget it might be nice to have the number inputs at both ends of the slider
[08:04:20] <uGoMobi> what do you think?
[08:04:30] <arschmitz> thats what ui-range-split does
[08:04:45] <arschmitz> so yeah i think its a great idea :)
[08:05:45] <arschmitz> and i have it so no matter what you add for a clas below 450px the slider is on its own line otherwise its not really usable
[08:06:28] <uGoMobi> ok I am finishing something here and then I will look into the code I had for slider full width and look into range as well
[08:07:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: range isnt ready yet ill let you know when it is though
[08:08:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I understand, but I can keep in mind the same css should be used for range that has two inputs
[08:09:13] <uGoMobi> if we make the slider itself full width below 28em for the range widget we probably should do the same for the slider widget
[08:12:12] <arschmitz> yes
[08:16:11] <toddmparker> cool
[08:16:23] <toddmparker> i think all that makes a lot of sense
[09:07:32] <johnbender> toddmparker: _|Nix|_: has anyone taken a look at the jquery old test failures?
[09:08:48] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ^
[09:11:35] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I haven't look into it, but I think _|Nix|_ did
[09:23:32] <johnbender> uGoMobi: kk, I'll wait to hear back
[09:23:43] <johnbender> lots of intermittent failurs on 1.6.4
[09:23:45] <johnbender> :(
[09:24:10] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes I saw that
[10:09:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hold off a bit on looking at range im completely changing how it positions the sliders thought of a much better way
[10:10:34] <toddmparker> interesting
[10:11:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[10:11:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: as soon as i have a working draft ill show you
[10:12:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok cool

[10:53:25] <johnbender> kinblas: ping!
[11:05:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: A bunch of timeouts - both in the sequence tests and in other places. We should get rid of 1.6.4 ... we're testing against way to many versions of core.
[11:06:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: In our docs we claim to be supporting core 1.7.0 - 1.8.2 ...
[11:06:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So we should drop tests against 1.6.4 ...
[11:07:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I've reproduced https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5334
[11:08:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I was looking at that when I noticed a bug in core git. Fixed it with gibson042 and DaveMethvin ...
[11:09:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think we should remove the vclick, click, and submit handlers from the bottom of nav and move them into a file of their own. There's more and more code in nav that has nothing to do with nav - like adding/removing the ui-btn-active class to buttons.
[11:10:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I guess the submit handler can stay.
[11:23:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, it doesn't look like we're doing the scrolling in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5334 ...
[11:23:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Maybe it's a history thing.
[11:30:35] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: looking at 5334
[11:31:28] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: some of that class stuff is there because it's tied to how we're finessing things for nav, right?
[11:35:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: What class stuff?
[11:36:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I fixed it in the meantime with a window.scrollTo(), but it's not seamless enough. It briefly flashes to the top of the page.
[11:36:44] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm trying to see if I can scroll to the top of the page sooner - like, before the hashchange.
[11:36:56] <toddmparker> like adding the active class and removing it based on nav conditions
[11:37:08] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: that would be good
[11:37:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm not sure what that's fore. I haven't done that.
[11:37:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think that's for tracking the currently active popup.
[11:37:41] <_|Nix|_> s/fore/for/
[11:38:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: See for yourself: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/fix-5334.html
[11:38:12] <toddmparker> think we're talking about two different things
[11:38:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm talking about the scroll-to-0 that's happening in https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5334 ...
[11:38:35] <toddmparker> 1. your suggestion to pull class stuff out of nav 2. fixing the popup scroll
[11:39:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Oh, OK!
[11:39:02] <toddmparker> that link isn't opening for me. Internal?
[11:39:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No, should work ... lemme check ...
[11:39:27] <toddmparker> k
[11:39:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Sorry - that's a 404, right?
[11:39:42] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: See for yourself: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/jquery-mobile/fix-5334.html

[11:39:44] <toddmparker> The requested URL /nix/fix-5334.html was not found on this server.
[11:39:44] <toddmparker> Apache/2.2.22 (Fedora) Server at babulina.go-nix.ca Port 8080
[11:39:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Wrong path.
[11:39:54] <toddmparker> ah
[11:40:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Should be good now.
[11:40:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I should really move jQm to /jqm on my server :)
[11:40:33] <_|Nix|_> Waay too many levels deep ...
[11:42:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Moving the vclick and the click handlers out of nav is a bit sticky because they'll need to both be calling the same function. So, one of them is going to have to act as the library, and the other as the client. I'm thinking: the new-fangled factored-out global click routing and active state handling shall depend on functionality inside nav.
[11:42:54] <toddmparker> seems to be loading nowâ€¦slowly
[11:43:47] <toddmparker> is this stuff you're looking to do for 1.3 or 1.4?
[11:43:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, it's the laptop I'm working on. I'm keeping the CPU busy :)
[11:44:10] <toddmparker> gotcha. i have bad web connectivity here too
[11:44:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I dunno, and it depends on johnbender's nav refactor too.
[11:44:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That thing really needs to land before we can make any more changes to nav - otherwise johnbender's gonna have a bad time merging.
[11:44:52] <toddmparker> so this sounds like it should be part of the bigger discussion for 1.4
[11:45:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: toddmparker: I'm closing in on it
[11:45:11] <johnbender> I've got 4 test failures in the entire suite left
[11:45:31] <johnbender> I'll merge as soon as I can and then dive into cleaning it up a bit
[11:45:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Good stuff! Eye of the tiger!
[11:45:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm not sure where else those handlers make sense
[11:45:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm thinking in a file on their own.
[11:45:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: but with what purpose
[11:46:07] <johnbender> we can't exclude them from a build can we?
[11:46:09] <johnbender> hmm
[11:46:11] <johnbender> I suppose you could
[11:46:16] <johnbender> if you did all your nav through hash manip
[11:46:18] <johnbender> or $.navigate
[11:46:25] <johnbender> the soon to be $.navigate
[11:46:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: actually that makes sense to me
[11:46:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: yeah. If you don't want jQM to handle button clicksm well ... *shrug*
[11:46:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well we talked about that
[11:47:07] <johnbender> it would be better to avoid direct calls to changePage internally
[11:47:10] <johnbender> for consistency
[11:47:16] <johnbender> that's one way to look at it
[11:47:32] <johnbender> stripping them out would let people build their own click handlers
[11:47:37] <johnbender> something to think about
[11:47:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yep.
[11:47:54] <johnbender> ok that makes sense to me at least at an abstract level
[11:48:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and the entry point to navigation can better crystallize that way.
[11:48:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Because the click handler delivers the URL to nav and the nav does whatever it needs to.
[11:49:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There's some feedback though ... the click handler's gonna need to know whether nav can handle a given link or whether it's a HTTP link.
[11:49:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It needs to know, because it affects the application (or lack thereof) of the ui-btn-active class.
[11:49:34] <toddmparker> that fix seems to work. i was seeing a jump in chrome before
[11:50:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, I dunno ... it seems to flash briefly to the top on my iPod.
[11:50:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Might just be bad iPod performance.
[11:50:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Oh, crap ... I know why it's slow. I have PHP console turned on :) So that's a lot of round-trips to my server :)
[11:51:01] <toddmparker> ah!
[11:51:14] <toddmparker> sorry, but i'm hopping into a meeting for a bit
[11:51:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's gone now.
[11:51:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: NP.
[11:51:35] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: You're enmeeting.
[11:52:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Crap. Now, when you click back to go to the first page, first it jumps to 0, then it transitions to the prev. page.
[11:52:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, we're not out of the woods yet.
[11:52:43] * _|Nix|_ is putting the PHP console back in.
[11:57:26] <_|Nix|_> OK. The scroll to the top when returning to page 1 is not my problem, because it's happening whether or not one opens a popup.
[12:03:24] <_|Nix|_> It is a problem though because it's not happening in the docs.
[12:25:59] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! Why am I not getting an inset listview here? http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/jqm/jquery-mobile/fix-5334.html
[12:26:20] <_|Nix|_> <ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true"> ... anything else?

[12:29:27] <_|Nix|_> OK ... not so bad ... on my iPod the brief flash to the top manifests itself as just that - a flash. It looks much worse on a page that contains a single word of text but is otherwise empty than on a page containing a long listview with the popup at the bottom.

[12:45:32] <toddmparker> nice fix
[12:46:02] <toddmparker> is inset broken?
[12:47:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Nono ... I was confused because I had the same list on two different pages.
[12:47:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I replaced the big empty div with a listview to see just how bad the flash-because-of-scroll-to-top was.
[12:47:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's not too bad.
[12:47:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Doesn't happen every time, either.
[12:48:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Cherry-picking to 1.2-stable now.
[12:50:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nice fix for that scrollbar. http://jsbin.com/uzaret/539 already shows the improvement.
[12:51:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, simple but effective :)

[13:24:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you still around?
[13:24:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[13:24:57] <arschmitz> ok updated slider... http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/range.html for a gallery of versions http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/range/ for docs
[13:25:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i havent finished re-doing the split layout so that one is missing
[13:26:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that looks great
[13:26:35] <arschmitz> sweet. also managed to drop half the css with this version
[13:26:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will look into the full width
[13:26:49] <uGoMobi> that sounds could
[13:26:52] <arschmitz> and make mini work work without any custom css too
[13:26:56] <uGoMobi> s/could/good/
[13:27:24] <uGoMobi> perfect
[13:27:55] <arschmitz> yup and the overlay position is guranteed to be perfect now no chance of breaking from custom css
[13:28:04] <arschmitz> with still no js for positioning
[13:33:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is this code/css in a branch on the main repo?
[13:33:45] <arschmitz> no its on my repo
[13:33:54] <arschmitz> i can push to the main repo if you would like
[13:35:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah that would be great

[13:44:28] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06range 146fd5169 15Alexander Schmitz: Slider: fix lint issue
[13:49:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: quick question do we enforce spaces vs tabs when i ran jshint on slider.js it has a ton of mixed spaces and tabs on stuff i never went near?
[13:49:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I always use tabs
[13:50:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i always do too, i was pretty sure thats what the core style guidelines call for
[13:50:53] <arschmitz> which is why im asking about the mixed tabs and spaces errors
[13:51:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I never noticed tabs got replaced by spaces
[13:51:50] <uGoMobi> maybe git does something unexpected
[13:52:23] <uGoMobi> how does it look if you look at the code on github?
[13:53:44] <arschmitz> looks like all the cases on switch in the handleKeydown: function are spaced in instead of tabbed 
[13:54:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its the same on master though
[13:55:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i just realized range breaks the slider test because it dosent change past the other handle
[13:56:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have to update those. since its just a branch it wont get built to brealk the build though right?
[13:56:44] <uGoMobi> yeah we should write different test before merging
[13:56:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, no worries
[13:57:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we can do that when the code is finished
[13:57:25] <arschmitz> Cool. yeah it will need its own tests and the slider ones will need to be modified to exclude range's
[13:57:37] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:58:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't see an issue with spaces instead of tabs here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/range/js/widgets/forms/range.js
[13:58:38] <uGoMobi> so I guess it's fine
[13:59:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi its in  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/slider.js#L224
[14:01:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah I see... looks like those space came with a commit from johnbender 
[14:02:03] <uGoMobi> we can clean that up
[14:03:40] <johnbender> uGoMobi: arschmitz: hmm I wonder how that got past the linter ...
[14:03:50] * johnbender is not a fan of tabs
[14:28:12] <toddmparker> arschmitz: that test page looks great
[14:29:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thank you it works much better then the one i showed before too and css is half the size!
[14:29:19] <toddmparker> I think when the label is stacked aver the input, the slider needs more margins
[14:29:25] <toddmparker> sweet
[14:31:07] <toddmparker> one thing i'd like to try as an additional class is a way to style most of the inputs away so this looks more like text feedback bit maybe if you tap, it gets the normal focus style
[14:35:44] <agcolom> hi, could someone please let me know what orientationchange and pageremove return please
[14:37:15] <agcolom> oh wait... do events return anything?
[14:39:24] <agcolom> I think forget my question... using the method template to document events makes say crazy things!
[14:39:29] <toddmparker> hee
[14:39:32] <toddmparker> hi agcolom 
[14:40:21] <agcolom> hi toddmparker 
[14:40:54] <agcolom> I'm into documenting the events.... so many of them!
[14:46:55] <toddmparker> yep, it's a lot

[22:55:54] <_|Nix|_> ?tell arschmitz Since you've recently looked at swipe events, do you think you could have a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5035? It seems we don't properly clean up after unbinding swipe event handlers after they're removed.
[22:55:55] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
