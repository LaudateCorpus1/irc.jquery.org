[05:15:57] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_ uGoMobi:
[05:15:58] <bot-t> (8 hours 47 mins ago) <gseguin> tell arschmitz Could you try out the grunt-0.4 branch and let me know if `grunt dist` does what you wanted? Output is in dist/demos. I don't see anything wrong with it but I'm not super familiar with it.
[05:16:07] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:19:15] <arschmitz> wow my irc is all screwey today
[05:19:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: am i showing as arschmitz or arschmitz_ ?
[05:20:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I only see arschmitz 
[05:20:24] <arschmitz> yeah its weird in my user list i only see arschmitz
[05:20:34] <arschmitz> and bot-t sees me as arschmitz
[05:20:50] <arschmitz> but im seeing my name as arschmitz_
[05:21:04] <arschmitz> and only arschmitz_ is highlighting 
[05:22:32] <toddmparker_> morning all
[05:22:47] <toddmparker_> you look like arschmitz to me, arschmitz 
[05:22:49] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker_:
[05:23:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah im thinking it must be something with my client
[05:25:06] <toddmparker_> only have 8 more widgets to port over, yee ha
[05:25:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker_nice
[05:25:24] <toddmparker_> should search be a top level widget? it is now, but it's just an input
[05:25:38] <toddmparker_> more a question of whether someone would look for it
[05:25:49] <toddmparker_> the widget list list more user-focused than plugin-focused
[05:26:20] <arschmitz> no i think its just a type of text input
[05:26:36] <arschmitz> and i think thats something the vast majority of people will realize
[05:30:02] <toddmparker_> ok, only 7 more to go!
[05:30:34] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: hey we were talking about usb chargers for the test lab when i was there the other day
[05:30:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: have you thought of just using a powered usb hub?
[05:35:14] <toddmparker> arschmitz: Yeah, unfortunately they don't work
[05:35:30] <toddmparker> You get USB power warnings
[05:35:54] <arschmitz> toddmparker: hmm iv done it with some phones on a belkin 7 port one 
[05:35:56] <toddmparker> I just found some 4x USB chargers
[05:36:01] <arschmitz> cool
[05:36:03] <toddmparker> Yeah?
[05:36:09] <arschmitz> yup
[05:36:13] <toddmparker> Might depend on the draw 
[05:36:23] <arschmitz> probably i know its useless with like ipads
[05:36:35] <toddmparker> The hubs we had crapped out, even with external power
[05:36:36] <arschmitz> but most chargers are execpt the actual ipad one
[05:37:08] <toddmparker> I bought 350 in power squids and chargers yesterday
[05:37:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: damn
[05:37:22] <toddmparker> Ya
[05:37:39] <toddmparker> I'll let you know how it goes
[05:37:44] <arschmitz> toddmparker: if you wanted to be a super neard you would just get a pc power supply and wire it up lol
[05:37:58] <toddmparker> I'm not nerdy enough
[05:38:02] <arschmitz> lol
[05:38:14] <toddmparker> Wish I was
[05:38:30] <arschmitz> i saw an interview with bill gates yesterday where he called steve jobs out on not being nerdy enough lol
[05:38:30] <toddmparker> A 16 port charger = $600
[05:38:36] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:38:40] <arschmitz> i found a 32 for the same
[05:38:58] <toddmparker> Prolly the same company. UK?
[05:39:11] <arschmitz> cambronix
[05:39:21] <toddmparker> I asked and they said the 32 wouldn't charge 32 phones. WAT?
[05:39:27] <toddmparker> Yeah, them
[05:39:30] <arschmitz> weird??
[05:39:37] <toddmparker> Yeah. 
[05:39:43] <arschmitz> whats the point then lol
[05:40:48] <arschmitz> you wouldnt think something like this would be so hard to find / expensive
[05:40:59] <arschmitz> they are about as simple as it gets
[05:43:09] <arschmitz> damn! i found one that will do 32 ipads at once!
[05:43:18] <arschmitz> but it will hurt your wallet for sure!
[05:43:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker: http://www.encoredataproducts.com/charging/syncing/datamation-systems-ds-ip-32sc-32-port-ipad-charge-and-sync-console/?gclid=CPXYg9WelbUCFQ2i4AodkFgA9A
[05:44:55] <toddmparker_> daaaang
[05:45:10] <arschmitz> its a BEAST!
[05:45:56] <arschmitz> kinda looks like they did what i said and just wired a pc powersupply to a hub lol
[05:47:54] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: that price is brutal though
[05:48:27] <toddmparker> Yeah
[05:48:54] <toddmparker> The hidden cost of a test lab 
[05:49:11] <toddmparker> I also got timers so these won't always charge
[05:49:17] <arschmitz> nice good idea
[05:49:32] <toddmparker> Phantom draw must be aweful
[05:49:34] <arschmitz> could hurt the electric bill lol
[05:54:08] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[05:54:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I have a question about jqmData
[05:54:51] <arschmitz> ok
[05:54:52] <uGoMobi> can you help me?
[05:54:57] <arschmitz> very possibly
[05:55:25] <uGoMobi> for panels I want to store data on the page element
[05:55:33] <arschmitz> ok
[05:55:37] <uGoMobi> that is for chaining panels
[05:55:46] <arschmitz> ok
[05:55:57] <uGoMobi> so I want data-panel='open'
[05:56:15] <uGoMobi> addClass doesn't work (timing issue)
[05:56:22] <arschmitz> ok
[05:56:28] <uGoMobi> so I use self._page.jqmData( "panel", "open" );
[05:56:55] <uGoMobi> and check with self._page.is( ":jqmData(panel='open')" )
[05:57:58] <uGoMobi> and remove it with self._page.jqmRemoveData( "panel" );
[05:58:07] <uGoMobi> but this doesn't work :(
[05:58:26] <uGoMobi> self._page returns the page element
[05:58:44] <uGoMobi> what am I doing wrong?
[05:58:47] <arschmitz> ok just give me one sec i think i see the problem but want to check
[05:58:53] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[06:00:02] <arschmitz> no problem

[06:07:08] <arschmitz> ok i see the issue
[06:07:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: :jqmData is an attribute selector
[06:07:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: when you set somthing with jqmData thats not setting the attribute
[06:07:59] <arschmitz> thats just storing the data on the object
[06:07:59] <uGoMobi> ahaa... I should $.data then?
[06:08:08] <arschmitz> no you just cant use is
[06:08:32] <arschmitz> you will need to do self._page.jqmData('panel') === "open"
[06:09:03] <arschmitz> the data funstions all set data on the object not an attribute on the actual element
[06:09:04] <uGoMobi> ah ok, so setting it with self._page.jqmData( "panel", "open" ); is fine
[06:09:09] <arschmitz> yup
[06:09:15] <uGoMobi> but I shouldn't check with is()
[06:09:20] <arschmitz> right
[06:09:36] <uGoMobi> I get it
[06:09:46] <uGoMobi> perfect, thanks a lot!
[06:09:50] <arschmitz> no problem
[06:22:18] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: you still here?
[06:27:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: do you think we should give panels a default theme instead of null? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5561#issuecomment-12996141
[06:28:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: +1 for default theme transparent default popup is weird
[06:29:04] <arschmitz> panel i mean
[06:30:23] <uGoMobi> yeah and you can still set data-theme="none" if you like
[06:30:34] <arschmitz> yup
[06:32:20] <uGoMobi> I was already afraid that that issue was about a big transform3d, fixed position or z-index problem... but there was just no theme :)
[06:32:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i ran into this before but didnt really think to much about it
[06:33:04] <arschmitz> just set a theme and moved on lol
[06:35:09] <arschmitz> and  its a bit misleading in docs on the one thats a "panel with defaults" because it has a theme set which is not "default"
[06:58:30] <toddmparker> +1 for a default theme on panels
[06:58:30] <toddmparker> C?
[07:03:19] <uGoMobi> C sounds good, will change that and at to API docs

[07:11:49] <toddmparker> Another 1.4 thing - simplify all that and just have 1 swatch by default 
[07:11:57] <toddmparker> ?
[07:12:18] <toddmparker> Our default mapping is...complex
[07:19:52] <toddmparker> arschmitz: I just picked up a Surface for testing
[07:24:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: nice
[07:25:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker: have you tried reproducing that issue? (fingers crossed its not as bad as i fear!)
[07:39:30] <toddmparker> arschmitz: When I open the custom select, I see the URL pop up but tge page still works
[07:39:55] <arschmitz> hmm so this does not look like a big problem then
[07:39:58] <toddmparker> Give me a test page and what to look fir and I'll report back
[07:40:06] <toddmparker> Nope
[07:40:24] <toddmparker> Was just pkaying in the store
[07:41:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5558#issuecomment-12987430
[07:41:51] <arschmitz> im still confused about issue but we should not be triggering any http requests there
[07:43:13] <toddmparker> Not sure how to test
[07:43:43] <toddmparker> Don't think this has a Dev console/inspector 
[07:43:50] <arschmitz> hmmmm
[07:44:24] <toddmparker> seems to act the same as ie8 in browser stack 
[07:44:33] <toddmparker> Fwiw
[07:44:47] <arschmitz> 8 or 9?
[07:45:01] <arschmitz> or 10 even lol it should be 10.
[07:46:34] <toddmparker> Sorry, ie10 on win8
[07:47:07] <toddmparker> JUST FIX IT ARSCHMITZ
[07:47:49] <arschmitz> lol
[07:48:02] <arschmitz> well ie9 there are no server requests sent
[07:52:08] <arschmitz> ie 10 desktop does not make any requests
[08:21:16] <gseguin> hey all
[08:29:58] <Wilto> Morning.
[08:30:08] <arschmitz> Morning Wilto
[08:32:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i have an idea for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5514
[08:32:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, I didn't take a look at select.js yet
[08:33:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no i said i have an idea lol
[08:33:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oops, sorry.. misread
[08:34:31] <arschmitz> im thinking we can do one of 2 things
[08:35:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we can just have select trigger focusout on the page on change
[08:36:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: won't that cause an issue with custom multiple select?
[08:37:45] <Wilto> Is the jQuery ZNC thing on fire again?
[08:38:20] <arschmitz> Wilto seems it iv been having trouble all day
[08:38:45] <uGoMobi> IRCCloud is having a good day for a change ;)
[08:39:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im looking now at customs the other choice is to use a new event just for this
[08:40:16] <uGoMobi> maybe we can make an exception for custom multiple select if needed
[08:40:23] <uGoMobi> first idea sounds best
[08:40:24] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:40:28] <arschmitz> i agree
[08:40:51] <arschmitz> im just trying to look at custom and normal select and figure out exactly how they are interacting to make this work right
[08:41:47] <uGoMobi> with custom multiple select we have the popupclose event
[08:41:52] <uGoMobi> I suppose
[08:42:18] <arschmitz> ok this is fine
[08:42:22] <uGoMobi> I think it's safe to bind to that event in fixedToolbar
[08:42:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: custom select triggers the change it self
[08:42:57] <arschmitz> and the listener in regular select is over written
[08:42:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, but after each item you select, right?
[08:43:13] <arschmitz> so if we have select trigger focus out on change
[08:43:20] <arschmitz> it wont effect custom at all
[08:43:55] <uGoMobi> was the original issue with Chrome only with a native select
[08:44:09] <uGoMobi> with custom select the toolbars do become visible again?
[08:44:15] <uGoMobi> I don't remember
[08:44:28] <arschmitz> with a custom select the keyboard does not ever open
[08:44:41] <arschmitz> or selct menu thing 
[08:45:14] <uGoMobi> yes, but don't we hide the toolbars anyway?
[08:45:34] <arschmitz> hmm im not completely sure
[08:45:40] <uGoMobi> neither am I
[08:45:44] <arschmitz> but it would all be handled very different
[08:46:01] <arschmitz> because the user is not manipulating the select we are
[08:46:11] <arschmitz> and we are handleing the focus our selves too
[08:46:15] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:46:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i think we shouldnt worry about customs for now and just fix native like the issue has
[08:47:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure, but we just have to test with both native and custom select
[08:48:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/select.js#L184 if in all these bindings we just need to add to have it trigger focusout on parent page on change
[08:48:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes test for sure!
[08:50:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes sound like the solution to me. 
[08:50:25] <uGoMobi> sounds*
[08:51:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/ixudew/18/edit
[08:52:57] <gseguin> arschmitz: did bot-t deliver my message?
[08:53:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: when you get a sec can you test that i dont have a android 4 device handy
[08:53:23] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: just tested... doesn't work
[08:53:26] <arschmitz> gseguin yes thanks i have not had a chance to do a build of it yet been a busy morning
[08:53:36] <gseguin> k
[08:53:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: damn i wonder why that does not work
[08:53:56] <gseguin> just let me know when you get to
[08:54:37] <arschmitz> gseguin: will do
[08:54:55] <arschmitz> it might not be till monday :( im going to be gone all weekend
[08:55:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh i see we are checking the target
[08:55:33] <arschmitz> ill fix it
[08:56:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: 
[08:56:21] <uGoMobi>  $(document).on('change',"#size",function(){
[08:56:21] <uGoMobi>     $(this).blur();
[08:56:21] <uGoMobi>   });
[08:56:28] <uGoMobi> works better
[08:56:29] <toddmparker> Gott say the Surface is pretty slick
[08:56:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i was trying to keep the behivor native but make it work but that works
[08:57:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah iv wanted to play around and try one
[08:57:28] <arschmitz> toddmparker: did you get the keyboard with it?
[08:57:38] <uGoMobi> I read some negative reviews about Win8 RT
[08:58:12] <uGoMobi> but always have to try for yourself :)
[08:59:38] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yep
[08:59:47] <toddmparker> it works pretty well
[08:59:54] <arschmitz> is the "click" as satisfying as they say lol?
[09:00:03] <toddmparker> the os can be a bit slow, but it's the nicest windows experience I've seen
[09:00:07] <toddmparker> it's ok
[09:00:10] <uGoMobi> cool
[09:00:18] <toddmparker> like the cover/keyboard combo
[09:00:30] <toddmparker> so let me know what to test and how
[09:01:09] <uGoMobi> I do really like that WP Metro style
[09:06:10] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and arschmitz - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5570
[09:06:19] <toddmparker> should we add a refresh method today for tables?
[09:06:26] <toddmparker> worth a look for rc
[09:08:02] <arschmitz> yeah i think so
[09:09:30] <toddmparker> arschmitz: do you have time to give that look today?
[09:10:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ill take a look im trying to fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5532 right now
[09:10:32] <arschmitz> ill check out tables after
[09:13:31] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i just peaked at tables this will be a bit of work
[09:14:06] <arschmitz> because reflow and column toggle are not extensions and will each need their own refresh along with a generic table refresh
[09:16:17] <toddmparker> right
[09:16:37] <arschmitz> not sure ill have time to finish it today
[09:17:06] <toddmparker> if not, it can wait for 1.4
[09:17:34] <arschmitz> ok yeah tables could probably use a bit of an internal refactor to make the modes extensions too
[09:18:11] <toddmparker> thought they were built as extensions to table.js
[09:18:52] <arschmitz> no :( https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/table.columntoggle.js
[09:19:18] <arschmitz> we drill into the prototype and then do a giant delegate
[09:19:50] <arschmitz> very similar to how listview filter is now
[09:22:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker: we only have like 3 actual widget extensions right now because it was not really possible prior to ui 1.9
[09:25:55] <uGoMobi> we need a destroy method for table too
[09:26:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i saw that too table on has one method right now lol
[09:26:50] <uGoMobi> in case you want to add data when the initialized it's easy
[09:27:14] <uGoMobi> bind to pagebeforecreate or don't use data-role="table" but call the plugin
[09:27:27] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:27:41] <arschmitz> but no manipulation is possible at all after init
[09:27:50] <uGoMobi> but if you want to add table rows when the page is already initialized I don't think you can do that
[09:27:54] <uGoMobi> right
[09:28:05] <uGoMobi> can't destroy and enhance again
[09:28:10] <arschmitz> nope
[09:28:28] <arschmitz> and i think this is just too much work to finish and test by end of day lol
[09:28:39] <uGoMobi> yeah I can imagine
[09:28:45] <uGoMobi> not a small change
[09:28:48] <arschmitz> too bad it was not noticed earlier 
[09:29:15] <uGoMobi> is this something we can add in a 1.3.1 release?
[09:29:17] <arschmitz> because its not horribly diffacult but will take a bit of time and need some good testing
[09:29:26] <uGoMobi> or too big for a maintenance release?
[09:29:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think so
[09:29:43] <arschmitz> even though its big i really think its a bug
[09:29:53] <arschmitz> destroy for sure is promissed by widget factory
[09:30:03] <arschmitz> so thats a bug
[09:30:17] <arschmitz> refresh is not promissed but it really "should" generally be there
[09:30:53] <arschmitz> even if we just get destroy in for the 1.3.1 it will at least make it possible if not ideal
[09:31:31] <uGoMobi> I suggest we put JS Bin in a comment to show how you can do it prior to init and set milestone 1.3.1 for adding refresh and destroy methods
[09:31:45] <arschmitz> +1

[11:12:27] <toddmparker> agree on the refresh and destroy
[11:12:46] <toddmparker> wait for after 1.3 but document how to do it the less ideal way
[11:12:53] <toddmparker> wish we had seen that earlier
[12:14:22] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah its really too bad its not hard just more time then i have
[12:19:06] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: you around?
[12:19:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: 
[12:19:13] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:19:16] <toddmparker> we should catch up on the TR stuff
[12:19:31] <uGoMobi> ok
[12:19:40] <toddmparker> just want to patch up those previews…I can give it a look if you haven't had a chance
[12:20:02] <toddmparker> thought those would all be the same, odd that A Vs. B are different
[12:20:22] <uGoMobi> I am almost done with panel issues
[12:20:38] <uGoMobi> just noticed other issue on IE9 and Opera
[12:20:45] <uGoMobi> after that I can look at TR
[12:21:22] <uGoMobi> yeah, weird that some elements are gone
[12:21:41] <toddmparker> yeah
[12:21:58] <toddmparker> let's talk in a bit…let you finish and I'll get my time in

[12:38:57] <agcolom> toddmparker: hi! do you think the note here: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/commit/4c0545482a1cbdf29c94260b817a914c11d90e13 is sufficient?
[12:39:46] <agcolom> also, is that the case also for column-toggle tables?
[12:45:28] <toddmparker> agcolom: yep, looks good!
[12:49:42] <agcolom> do we need it for column-toggle tables?
[12:50:08] <agcolom> toddmparker: ^
[12:54:08] <toddmparker> think it can't hurt to add it both places just to be safe. don't think it's as critical there
[12:54:31] <agcolom> ok, will do :-)

[12:57:40] <toddmparker> sheesh uGoMobi - that looked like a complicated one
[12:57:53] <uGoMobi> yeah :/
[12:58:01] <uGoMobi> half re-factor ;)
[12:58:02] <toddmparker> zowie
[12:58:06] <uGoMobi> but it worked out
[12:58:11] <toddmparker> great
[12:58:18] <toddmparker> thanks for fixing that up
[12:58:35] <toddmparker> so now you can't open two panels, even via JS?
[12:58:43] <toddmparker> or just markup?
[12:59:01] <uGoMobi> not at the same time
[12:59:40] <uGoMobi> if you open a 2nd panel now we first close the first one (animated) and then open the 2nd panel (also animated)
[13:00:22] <uGoMobi> but we don't have the css to have to open panels at a page at the same time
[13:00:57] <uGoMobi> imagine it would be a left and right panel... the two transform3d's would negate eachother
[13:01:12] <toddmparker> that's nice and tidy. like it
[13:01:18] <uGoMobi> cool
[13:01:26] <uGoMobi> only small issue on opera left
[13:01:26] <toddmparker> yeah, seems necessary w/ the transforms.
[13:01:29] <_|Nix|_> Wow! What a commitid: 6322222eb3933f2bfcd237f32db640629c3a7752
[13:01:55] <uGoMobi> get a vertical scrollbar on the page when opening a overlay panel
[13:02:19] <uGoMobi> will see if I can fix that later tonight
[13:02:29] <toddmparker> opera…mini? mobile? desktop? toaster oven?

[13:10:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: got a fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5532
[13:10:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ^^
[13:10:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah great!
[13:10:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just needed to enable the ios5 workaround in workarounds for ios6 too
[13:11:34] <arschmitz> not really super thrilled about that but its easy at least
[13:11:43] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:11:53] <uGoMobi> maybe 6.1 resolves it
[13:12:01] <arschmitz> no im on 6.1
[13:12:08] <uGoMobi> anyone got the update already... i didn't check
[13:12:11] <arschmitz> if anything 6.1 broke it
[13:12:22] <uGoMobi> ohw :(
[13:12:25] <arschmitz> oh 6.1 maybe lol was thinking 6.01
[13:12:37] <uGoMobi> right
[13:12:44] <uGoMobi> 6.1 is released
[13:12:49] <arschmitz> it is?
[13:13:12] <arschmitz> yup had not popped up for me yet but when i checked its there
[13:13:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this im pretty sure had been fixed with 6.0 but seems re broken with 6.1
[13:13:52] <uGoMobi> aha
[13:14:15] <uGoMobi> I am updating now to 6.1
[13:15:13] <arschmitz> cool
[13:35:25] <agcolom> toddmparker: johnbender so I have now updated the google document with what is still missing in the api doc in terms of events, methods and 'configuring default' options. https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vo_O-GVATYLbo1WggLjlGAQGuFzwE3fUP_8ZR7aftE0/edit# 
[13:36:14] <agcolom> There is still a lot missing... I'd be very grateful if you could have a look and let me know if there is anything we should not have in the api doc. 
[13:36:49] <agcolom> maybe we could also have a priority system (1 critical to 5 not so urgent)
[13:36:58] <agcolom> Thank you...
[13:37:19] <agcolom> (so in the 1st column, we could have 'yes, 1'
[13:37:55] <agcolom> I'll check at the weekend or on monday...

[13:39:00] <johnbender> gseguin: none
[13:39:22] <agcolom> thank you johnbender 
[13:44:10] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the page load / change / transition / initialization events should all be in the API docs
[13:44:19] <uGoMobi> (I can't edit the document)
[13:44:24] <johnbender> agcolom: you're a champ
[13:44:51] <agcolom> sorry, let me give you write access...
[13:45:20] <agcolom> should be ok to write now... https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vo_O-GVATYLbo1WggLjlGAQGuFzwE3fUP_8ZR7aftE0/edit?usp=sharing
[13:45:26] <uGoMobi> yup, thanks
[13:47:57] <uGoMobi> agcolom: nice document, very useful
[13:48:40] <agcolom> just a big copy paste exercise :-)
[13:49:04] <agcolom> I was going mad not having a checklist... so just did it... I feel a lot better now :-)
[13:49:09] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I will keep updating it while I go thru the docs this week
[13:49:19] <uGoMobi> yeah I can imagine
[13:49:24] <agcolom> perfect, thank you :-)
[13:49:24] <uGoMobi> I love checklists :)
[13:49:49] <agcolom> me too. just like for cooking, i need exact measures!
[13:51:38] <uGoMobi> I suppose this week we have to move everything from old docs to new location... site / api docs / new docs & demos / learn site
[13:52:53] <agcolom> yes... I have 3,500 words to write for monday, so will be a bit difficult this weekend.
[13:53:36] <agcolom> (and I am still about 2,000 words short!)
[13:53:46] <uGoMobi> aii
[13:54:20] <uGoMobi> well we have bit more than a week and this is not something you have to do
[13:54:30] <agcolom> yes, last assignment! I was mad doing this... hoping I can get a promotion after that...
[13:54:42] <uGoMobi> you just have to watch and see if we don't mess up your brand new API site ;)
[13:54:55] <uGoMobi> we can rewrite content later
[13:56:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In the process of writing the slider tooltip demo, I'm thinking that our view source could use the ability to display external files loaded via SJAX, just like the PHP functionality.
[13:56:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's because I'm keeping the slider tooltip extension separate from the demo code.
[13:56:36] <agcolom> sure... and then I also have to write a talk for the 22nd... but the demos will be v helpful for that!
[13:57:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that would be great
[13:57:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, basically, I should be able to give a <link rel="stylesheet" ... /> an ID and then refer to that from data-demo-css
[13:57:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Similarly for a script ...
[13:57:49] <uGoMobi> would take away the need to copy stuff from demo page to intro page
[13:58:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Great!
[13:58:05] <uGoMobi> where the view source button is
[13:58:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, yes, but it would introduce the need to put the snippets into separate files.
[13:58:40] <agcolom> ok, I'm off now... have a good evening/afternoon everyone.
[13:58:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: L8R
[13:59:05] <uGoMobi> good night Anne
[13:59:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh wait
[13:59:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I'm just pointing out what looks like an inevitable consequence.
[13:59:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  we are going to disable ajax
[13:59:32] <uGoMobi> in the docs
[13:59:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This is not AJAX navigation though.
[13:59:46] <uGoMobi> and only enable it on certain pages 
[13:59:53] <uGoMobi> pfff
[13:59:56] <uGoMobi> sorry
[13:59:57] <uGoMobi> late
[14:00:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP.
[14:00:06] <uGoMobi> sync AJAX
[14:00:09] <uGoMobi> got it
[14:00:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I'm calling $.ajax directly.
[14:00:37] <uGoMobi> I am so JQM minded then when I hear Ajax I can only think of our Ajax nav :)
[14:00:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: :)
[14:01:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Great! I'll get on this then.
[14:01:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool
[14:01:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Although I may push the demo first ... I just wanna get it in there ...
[14:02:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Its view-source will only show the HTML at first, until I get the JS and CSS SJAX-ing to work.
[14:02:12] <uGoMobi> yeah first things first
[14:02:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's great though - the extension itself can serve as an example on how to write extensions to widgets.
[14:02:51] <uGoMobi> that's ok... /demos/ is work in progress anyway
[14:03:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Illustrated in glorious SyntaxHighlighter.
[14:03:19] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:04:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just to get the whole picture... what exactly do you mean by "it would introduce the need to put the snippets into separate files."?
[14:08:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, if the view source button is on one page, but the code needs to run on another page, then it needs to be in a separate file, so it can be referred to from both pages.
[14:09:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: On the view-source page, there's a script tag with a src, but that code is only used to show it in the view-source. On the demo page, the same script is added with a script tag, but on the demo page the script is actually used to drive the demo.
[14:10:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[14:10:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, the view source page treats the script as text, whereas the demo page treats the script as executable code.
[14:10:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wherever we have such a setup, the script needs to be in a file on its own.
[14:10:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  I though we could leave it out on the intro page because you sAJAX it in from actual demo page
[14:11:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No, because the demo page has many script tags.
[14:11:21] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[14:11:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I suppose I could deep-link to it ;)
[14:11:48] <uGoMobi> we use ID's to target which script needs to be displayed in the view source
[14:11:56] <uGoMobi> same for style
[14:12:17] <_|Nix|_> We can data-demo-js="path/to/filename.html#script-tag-id"
[14:12:39] <uGoMobi> yeah that would be great
[14:13:19] <uGoMobi> because I know that when we have the same script/style at two different places we will have differences at some point
[14:13:42] <uGoMobi> and that's what I would really like to prevent
[14:14:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ...
[14:14:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK ... let's do this thing ...
[14:14:43] <uGoMobi> yeahh :)
[14:14:47] <toddmparker> agcolom and johnbender - the issue with nag is it's very "diffuse" in the docs…lots of events and methods sprinkled around…ideas?
[14:16:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I was thinking we might need to add some text in the guides section about the page events
[14:16:35] <uGoMobi> in the API docs they will be sorted alphabetically

[14:17:09] <uGoMobi> so it might be bit difficult to get the total picture,
[14:17:23] <uGoMobi> and in what order the event fire
[14:17:29] <uGoMobi> great _|Nix|_ !
[14:17:32] <uGoMobi> lemme look
[14:19:24] <uGoMobi> wow looks awesome _|Nix|_ !!
[14:20:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, it's not actually my work. I just ported it.
[14:20:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The original was written by Max Waterman for web-ui-fw.
[14:20:27] <uGoMobi> still it looks awesome :)
[14:20:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I point to the original in the first commit.
[14:20:35] <uGoMobi> thanks Max!
[14:21:42] <toddmparker> lemme look
[14:21:58] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/demos/slider/tooltip.html
[14:22:17] <toddmparker> nice work _|Nix|_ 
[14:22:21] <toddmparker> like it
[14:23:04] <toddmparker> so cool…those are written as extensions so you include the script and can use those new options…nice
[14:23:12] <uGoMobi> I am still amazed by what that small change to the slider input makes a difference
[14:23:58] <uGoMobi> (don't mind my grammar)
[14:25:36] <toddmparker> oh, dropping the border and smaller size? yeah
[14:25:42] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:25:44] <toddmparker> so glad we got that figured out
[14:25:51] <uGoMobi> yeah brilliant
[14:26:16] <toddmparker> been a bit distracted today but i'll be jamming tonight on demos. my goal is to have all the widgets done this weekend
[14:26:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am looking into TR at the moment
[14:26:26] <toddmparker> sweet!
[14:26:53] <uGoMobi> I need some time to get the whole picture of how the TR works
[14:27:03] <uGoMobi> but I can fix that this weekend
[14:27:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I can't take complete credit. My colleague Max Waterman wrote the origin code for web-ui-fw. I merely ported it - so, he did all the heavy lifting.
[14:27:35] <uGoMobi> so we can update the TR to 1.3RC on Monday
[14:27:42] <_|Nix|_> s/origin/original/
[14:27:59] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: that's the plan
[14:28:17] <toddmparker> also thinking we could point to only new demos for the blog post for RC
[14:28:29] <toddmparker> sort of ignore the current docs
[14:28:54] <toddmparker> once we figure out redirects, we can archive those
[14:29:21] <uGoMobi> or maybe wait with drawing attention to it until final
[14:29:29] <toddmparker> hmmm…if i link to test/docs/demos in the rc post
[14:29:48] <uGoMobi> there is no link to demos on the docs home page
[14:29:57] <toddmparker> then we move demos up to top level /test/ or test/demos, paths will be off
[14:30:07] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:30:19] <toddmparker> yeah, just wondering if i should start pointing to the new demos
[14:30:28] <toddmparker> maybe i'll wait and we'll make the switch for final
[14:30:49] <uGoMobi> yeah I think that's better
[14:30:54] <toddmparker> the rc post will be short - a list of new changes and download links.
[14:31:06] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[14:31:07] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: liking that a lot
[14:31:22] <uGoMobi> oh I didn't updated the release notes wiki page
[14:31:43] <uGoMobi> well there are not really new features
[14:31:44] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: think the text in the handle could be a bit smaller so 100 doesn't crash
[14:32:00] <toddmparker> and the tooltip might look nice w/roudned corners
[14:32:16] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: right. i was going to highlight new commits since beta
[14:32:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK.
[14:32:19] <uGoMobi> could mention ui-icon-alt/nodisc classes
[14:34:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: do you want to release 1.1.2/1.2.1 next week?
[14:34:23] <uGoMobi> or wait until after 1.3?
[14:57:00] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i'd like to get those releases out
[14:57:09] <toddmparker> i just need to write up the posts
[14:57:21] <toddmparker> lot going on
[14:57:39] <toddmparker> but after rc goes out, in theory, we can't touch the code in master so i'll try to do that
[14:58:20] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: can't you just show commits and just small introduction text
[14:58:51] <uGoMobi> low profile release
[14:59:20] <uGoMobi> but still takes time, i know
[15:04:10] <uGoMobi> ok I am off

[22:23:35] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker: have you guys typed File://// into something today? Maybe you could do it for me?
[22:23:38] <gseguin> johnbender: are you lurking?
[22:23:42] <johnbender> gseguin: ...
[22:23:45] <johnbender> amazing timing
[22:23:51] <gseguin> I press enter too fast
[22:23:55] <gseguin> :)
[22:24:11] <gseguin> hey could you take a look at my PR
[22:24:18] <gseguin> no real code change
[22:24:24] <gseguin> just making the linter happy
[22:24:41] <gseguin> btw do we currently lint as part of the build?
[22:25:23] <johnbender> gseguin: yes
[22:25:28] <gseguin> johnbender: sorry for the Travis CI commit, forgot it was there
[22:25:32] <johnbender> gseguin: why didn't it like the $?
[22:26:04] <gseguin> because since we're using AMD the linter config should not have jQuery or $ as a global
[22:26:12] <johnbender> ah
[22:26:16] <johnbender> you are correct
[22:26:18] <gseguin> that's why it's currently passing 
[22:26:33] <gseguin> but the current code is wrong
[22:26:47] <gseguin> doesn't matter in the end since we strip out the amd layer
[22:27:07] <johnbender> gseguin: word
[22:27:13] <johnbender> gseguin: looks fine to me
[22:27:17] <gseguin> cool
[22:27:22] <gseguin> green button it then
[22:27:33] <gseguin> also
[22:27:37] <gseguin> last thing
[22:28:01] <gseguin> shouldn't that guy: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.ns.js
[22:28:11] <gseguin> have an IIFE in it?
[22:28:59] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[22:29:30] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm I thought I corrected that 
[22:29:32] <johnbender> but yes
[22:29:57] <gseguin> alright I'll fix it
[22:30:18] <johnbender> gseguin: can you remove the travis bit too?
[22:30:23] <gseguin> johnbender: is it ok to do that on master?
[22:30:38] <johnbender> gseguin: as long as the tests pass I see no reason not to
[22:30:48] <gseguin> johnbender: it doesn't hurt, does it?
[22:30:57] <johnbender> gseguin: oh you mean travis?
[22:31:02] <gseguin> yeah
[22:31:13] <johnbender> well it appears to require grunt 4 
[22:31:16] <johnbender> err 0.4
[22:31:37] <gseguin> yeah but there is currently no travis hook set up
[22:32:30] <gseguin> I mean I don't mind removing it, I just think it's harmless that it's there
[22:33:13] <johnbender> gseguin: lets take it out for now until  we're ready to do it
[22:33:23] <johnbender> someone is going to notice
[22:33:29] <johnbender> and I'd rather it actually be a thing 
[22:33:33] <johnbender> if we're going to do it
[22:33:35] <johnbender> :(
[22:33:38] <johnbender> sorry to be lame
[22:34:12] <gseguin> ok get it

[22:36:14] <gseguin> johnbender: updated
[22:36:41] <gseguin> johnbender: I'll quickly fix ns in the same PR
[22:37:00] <johnbender> gseguin: cool, did we remove your commit access or something?
[22:38:29] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender and gseguin 
[22:38:34] <toddmparker_> up late, eh?
[22:38:41] <toddmparker_> File://// ??
[22:38:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: you're the one who's up late
[22:38:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: try it
[22:38:47] <toddmparker_> yeah, true
[22:38:49] <johnbender> any text dialog
[22:38:57] <johnbender> it will crash the app
[22:39:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: should have said that first :(
[22:39:10] <johnbender> sorry
[22:39:14] <toddmparker_> type that into...
[22:39:23] <johnbender> any applications text area
[22:39:38] <johnbender> safari's url bar will lock the app apparently
[22:40:01] <gseguin> johnbender: I hope not
[22:40:21] <gseguin> johnbender: I just don't like to green button myself
[22:40:23] <toddmparker_> works ok in chrome
[22:40:31] <johnbender> gseguin: then commit directly :) :)
[22:40:33] <gseguin> it feels wrong :)
[22:40:41] <toddmparker_> think my brain is mush...
[22:40:59] <toddmparker_> so the first pass at *all* the widget pages are done. yippe
[22:41:00] <gseguin> well, we're so close to releasing RC that I wanted another pair of eyes
[22:41:15] <toddmparker_> http://localhost:8888/jquery-mobile/docs/demos/
[22:41:30] <johnbender> gseguin: ah
[22:41:33] <toddmparker_> ha, hold on
[22:41:47] <gseguin> toddmparker_: catching up
[22:41:52] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/
[22:42:23] <gseguin> I'm on my linux box

[22:43:40] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 142397e2f 15Ghislain Seguin: Added Travis CI config...
[22:43:40] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14e802d5a 15Ghislain Seguin: Renamed $ to jQuery in the factory functions. jQuery is the variable passed to the inner IIFEs...
[22:43:40] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14499c369 15Ghislain Seguin: Removed Travis CI config file until we actually get it working
[22:46:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm having a hard time reading the text
[22:46:12] <johnbender> the contrast seems low
[22:46:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's super duper nice looking though
[22:47:09] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15toddparker pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/iXn1lA
[22:47:09] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 149ef5773 15toddparker: Demos: Removed demo class from a few pages that don't need it.
[22:47:18] <toddmparker_> yeah, it's a wee bit thin
[22:47:40] <toddmparker_> where is worst? i can bump it up or go with a heavier weight
[22:48:43] <gseguin> toddmparker_: the descriptions could be a little darker
[22:48:58] <toddmparker_> on the homepage, top section?
[22:49:03] <toddmparker_> those are damn light
[22:49:09] <gseguin> top section
[22:49:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5154648
[22:49:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah just darker should be enough
[22:49:30] <johnbender> at least for me
[22:49:32] <toddmparker_> hopefully inner pages are ok - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/buttons/
[22:49:50] <gseguin> johnbender: ah!
[22:50:13] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I'm color blind, I'm a good tester for contrast
[22:50:43] <toddmparker_> heh
[22:50:45] <gseguin> though what I don't see might not help you :)
[22:50:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: switching the p.jqm-intro to #222 or #333 made a big difference for me
[22:50:54] <toddmparker_> that's crazy johnbender 
[22:51:04] <toddmparker_> on it
[22:51:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes
[22:51:05] <johnbender> happily smug about it
[22:51:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that's just an observation not a suggestion
[22:51:37] <johnbender> I know nothing about what color text should be :)
[23:01:35] <toddmparker_> johnbender: for you...
