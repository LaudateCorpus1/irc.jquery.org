[06:04:13] <scott_gonzalez> Why are theme options split out from the rest of the options in the API site?
[07:14:33] <toddparker> Good morning
[07:14:41] <toddparker> wow, uGoMobi gets the triage award
[07:14:45] <toddparker> nice work!
[07:14:58] <uGoMobi> :D
[07:15:07] <uGoMobi> should make it an olympic sport ;-)
[07:21:51] <toddparker> gold medal
[07:22:08] <toddparker> i haven't had time to do much triage, i really appreciate the help
[07:22:18] <toddparker> agcolom is gone too
[07:31:39] <Wilto> Wat’chu mean “gone.”
[07:31:57] <Wilto> Also: hey guys.
[07:51:25] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: Working on https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/issues/2 it seems like they may need to stay separate in some cases.
[07:51:26] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2 on api.jquerymobile.com (scottgonzalez; 1h, 12m ago): Merge Theming and Options?
[07:51:50] <scott_gonzalez> http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/dialog/#theme-data-theme%20(as%20a%20data-attribute)
[07:52:52] <scott_gonzalez> I guess overlayTheme should be documented in the options, and then the theming section should have data-theme and data-overlay-theme (the attributes) documented?
[07:53:37] <scott_gonzalez> And the overlayTheme option might just point to the data-overlay-theme section?
[08:00:04] <toddparker> gone as in european vacation
[08:00:35] <toddparker> scott_gonzalez: that seems reasonable to me
[08:02:21] <toddparker> we've been documenting all the options under Options in the docs and just mention the data- version there for consistency. In the narrative, we usually reinforce the data- attributes like you see there with a demo
[08:03:03] <toddparker> ah, i see. dialogs in the current docs aren't yet in the API style format
[08:03:07] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html
[08:03:09] <toddparker> should be
[08:03:45] <toddparker> see how popup is documented for a better example
[08:03:45] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[08:03:53] <toddparker> options: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/options.html
[08:04:01] <toddparker> methods: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/methods.html
[08:04:07] <toddparker> events: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/events.html
[08:08:27] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so we'll drop the theming section and just explain the theming options in the narative at the top.
[08:08:59] <scott_gonzalez> Like the "Theming the popup and overlay" section on http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[08:10:41] <toddparker> think that makes sense
[08:11:06] <toddparker> and any theming options will be listed in addition under options

[08:11:25] <toddparker> the narrative is instructions for non-scripters
[08:11:50] <toddparker> the other 3 tabs should be a more traditional  API style docs with rigid formatting and be comprehensive
[08:12:01] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:12:15] <toddparker> dialog is just ancient. didn't realize that wasn't in the API style. All other widgets are.
[08:12:19] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[08:12:27] <toddparker> you're on mobile today, right?
[08:12:32] <gseguin> indeed
[08:12:54] <toddparker> cool
[08:13:03] <toddparker> mind looking at this PR
[08:13:03] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4803
[08:13:04] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (4d, 14h ago): Collapsible: Add support for same expanded/collapsed non default icon
[08:13:08] <gseguin> going to look into the builder's issue unless you've got something more urgent for me
[08:13:11] <gseguin> ok
[08:13:22] <toddparker> seems that if you spec the same icon for both, it isn't happy
[08:13:30] <toddparker> uGoMobi: did you look at that PR?
[08:15:13] <toddparker> gseguin: i'm going thru my inbox so i'll bug you with a few things. Yell at me if I
[08:15:22] <toddparker> I'm being annoying :)
[08:15:31] <gseguin> no worries
[08:15:45] <toddparker> is this builder issue still open? saw you made some fixes - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder/issues/17

[08:17:35] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: thanks for fixing that popup > dialog issue. Just tested and it works like a charm
[08:18:31] <toddparker> gseguin: re: support.touch
[08:18:32] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4786
[08:18:32] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4786 on jquery-mobile (jtara; 6d, 10h ago): $.support.touch was dropped from 1.2
[08:18:47] <toddparker> did you and johnbender discuss this after last week's call?
[08:19:03] <gseguin> toddparker: yeah issue is stilll open
[08:19:05] <toddparker> personally, i think this is a really useful feature test to include
[08:19:22] <gseguin> some wrong metadata are causing the builder to fail
[08:19:23] <toddparker> even if we don't happen to use it internally - was that why it was removed
[08:19:46] <toddparker> we use touch support tests on most client projects
[08:20:02] <gseguin> yeah that was why, I believe I had a discussion with scott_gonzalez about it and it resulted in me removing it
[08:20:21] <toddparker> do you remember the reasoning?
[08:21:15] <gseguin> that it wasn't necessary to expose it and that it was ok to remove it since $.support is not part of the public API ( if I remember well )
[08:21:49] <gseguin> I'll put it back in
[08:22:13] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: It was because $.support.touch is more than likely being misused by developers.
[08:22:28] <scott_gonzalez> The one case that gseguin and I looked at inside jQuery Mobile where it was used was incorrect.
[08:22:57] <scott_gonzalez> It can stay, but $.support is explicitly not public API.
[08:23:08] <gseguin> thanks for refreshing my memory
[08:23:26] <gseguin> right now it's gone and we've had several complaints
[08:23:44] <scott_gonzalez> Which is honestly silly since it's one line of code.
[08:24:09] <gseguin> true
[08:24:20] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery normalizes browser differences, it is not a feature testing device.
[08:25:08] <toddparker> i know, but if it's something people are using
[08:25:15] <scott_gonzalez> I understand why devs are enticed to lean on $.support, but it's very much not public and subject to change at any time.
[08:25:45] <scott_gonzalez> "Primarily intended for jQuery's internal use; specific properties may be removed when they are no longer needed internally to improve page startup performance."
[08:25:47] <toddparker> although i agree in theory, i think that we'd want to give more warning
[08:25:50] <gseguin> but in the scope of mobile it makes sense to expose whether it's a touch device
[08:25:53] <toddparker> and justification
[08:26:01] <toddparker> gseguin: right.
[08:26:21] <toddparker> we are feature-based, not UA so I can see how people would want to use similar feature tests
[08:26:31] <scott_gonzalez> $.mobile.supportsTouch?
[08:26:45] <scott_gonzalez> It's ok to keep it on $.support.
[08:27:03] <toddparker> ok if it's one line of code and doesn't hurt anything, i agree to restore it
[08:27:07] <scott_gonzalez> But the story for devs is "Don't expect anything on $.support to be reliable in the future."
[08:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> So you might want to explicitly document that you intend to keep it around.
[08:27:31] <toddparker> we can be like apple and look for all private API calls
[08:27:58] <toddparker> i can see wanting to keep this support test 4eva
[08:28:18] <toddparker> of the few feature tests we regular use a project, touch is one of 'em
[08:28:26] <scott_gonzalez> Hopefully that's not rue and Touch Events will die in a fire.
[08:28:31] <scott_gonzalez> s/rue/true/
[08:28:37] <toddparker> maybe in a decade or so
[08:28:52] <gseguin> alright so $.mobile.supportsTouch = $.support.touch
[08:28:54] <gseguin> ?
[08:29:09] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: You can choose either (or both).
[08:29:29] <scott_gonzalez> I was just suggesting not putting it on $.support if the intention is to provide a stable, public API.
[08:30:13] <gseguin> toddparker: stable public api ?
[08:30:13] <toddparker> so both then
[08:30:19] <gseguin> alright
[08:30:53] <gseguin> in the docs we should not mention $.support, just $.mobile.supportsTouch
[08:30:59] <toddparker> don't break anyone using $.support.touch but let's document this new supportsTouch as the mobile way to doing things
[08:31:18] <gseguin> you got it
[08:31:29] <toddparker> I think we should explain why we added this and that people should switch away from support
[08:31:49] <toddparker> since that could change/go away in the future
[08:31:59] <gseguin> yep
[08:36:00] <toddparker> commented and assigned to you gseguin

[08:36:02] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4786 on jquery-mobile (jtara; 6d, 11h ago): $.support.touch was dropped from 1.2
[08:36:10] <gseguin> thanks
[08:49:00] <johnbender> gseguin: should we follow the enabled convention?
[08:49:34] <gseguin> hmm as in $.mobile.touchEnabled?
[08:50:26] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[09:03:13] <toddparker> touchSupported?
[09:03:40] <toddparker> guess that the same as supportsTouch
[09:03:53] <toddparker> enabled seems a bit like something that can be disabled
[09:03:58] <toddparker> more of a capability
[09:04:14] <toddparker> that guys seems happy with this resolution
[09:04:20] <toddparker> This sounds like a good resolution.
[09:04:21] <toddparker> The quasi-supported/quasi-unsupported nature of $.support has always been unsettling. But that is a jQuery issue. jQuery needs to get off the fence.
[09:04:22] <toddparker> It makes sense for jQuery Mobile to not pollute $.support. JQM support variables belong in $.mobile somewhere.
[09:04:23] <toddparker> This resolution gives time to third-party developers to remove their use of $.support, while at the same time providing a supported feature variable. It is important for plugins to be able to know what features JQM understands the browser to have, so that they can match that expectation.
[09:09:42] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker makes a good point
[09:09:47] <johnbender> touchSupported I guess
[09:14:02] <toddparker> johnbender: on today's tech cabal, we should get the details on the core license switch so we can do the same

[09:14:15] <johnbender>  
[09:14:21] <johnbender> word
[09:15:07] <gseguin> I like the supportsTouch better as "supports" acts like a namespace
[09:15:28] <johnbender> gseguin: $.mobile.support.touch
[09:15:45] <gseguin> that too
[09:16:31] <gseguin> alright changing it
[09:17:04] <toddparker> gseguin: true
[09:17:13] <toddparker> either is good with me
[09:17:34] <toddparker> are there any parallels that we can use as a reference for naming here?
[09:17:41] <toddparker> whatever do we will be around for a while
[09:17:53] <toddparker> uGoMobi: what are you up to?
[09:42:47] <toddparker> uGoMobi: thinking we might just want to negate the bottom shadow for now
[09:42:58] <toddparker> if we can do that at the widget css level
[09:43:02] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 4 new commits to master: http://git.io/coYIZQ
[09:43:02] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Introduced $.mobile.supportsTouch as a supported API and resuscitated $.support.touch though it is still unsupported. - Ghislain Seguin

[09:43:38] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Jasper de Groot (1d, 4h ago): Theme: unset light shadow for input clear button and slider handle.
[09:43:53] <toddparker> actually, we should add that to the theme css
[09:44:04] <toddparker> theme should be pretty widget agnostic
[09:44:29] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I am back, catching up now
[09:44:32] <toddparker> but in the various widget css files, we should negate there
[09:47:24] <uGoMobi> Re https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4803
[09:47:25] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (4d, 16h ago): Collapsible: Add support for same expanded/collapsed non default icon
[09:47:38] <uGoMobi> yes, I looked at that PR
[09:48:54] <uGoMobi> looks good to me, but I asked johnbender to look at it as well, because we are between alpha and final
[09:49:26] <johnbender> toddparker: uGoMobi: I keep telling _|Nix|_ to hold off on stuff and then we keep sneaking it in :(
[09:51:18] <toddparker> we don't need to land that for 1.2
[09:51:34] <toddparker> do we have a way to land stuff for 1.3
[09:52:59] <uGoMobi> toddparker: if we create a branch for it you can pull the PR branch local and then pick in the 1.3 branch
[09:53:49] <uGoMobi> also reviewed this PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4812
[09:53:50] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (1d, 4h ago): Select: Add non-native optgroup divider-theme support
[09:54:37] <johnbender> toddparker: branches
[09:55:04] <johnbender> unless we want to create a new branch for either 1.2-stable or 1.3 that we can merge in later
[09:55:29] <uGoMobi> if saw you can also define the branch it should be merged into when you create a PR
[09:56:11] <toddparker> sounds good
[09:56:16] <uGoMobi> but then of course you have to know our "branch system"
[09:56:28] <toddparker> i was waiting for _|Nix|_  to fix that dialog nav issue
[09:56:36] <uGoMobi> we can ask MauriceG to take that into account when creating a PR
[09:56:49] <toddparker> now that's fixed, have you guys seems any other popup issues that look bad?
[09:57:03] <toddparker> i tested a few today that turned out to be unreproducable
[09:57:34] <toddparker> we can plan on moving 1.2 to the next step soon
[09:57:42] <toddparker> think we need to go beta
[09:57:47] <toddparker> or can move into RCs
[09:58:42] <uGoMobi> toddparker: Re that bottom glow
[09:59:10] <uGoMobi> negating it in the structure CSS means no shadow at all for the slider handle and clear button
[09:59:52] <uGoMobi> but I agree that adding widget specific rules in the theme CSS is not what we want either
[10:01:25] <toddparker> right
[10:01:27] <toddparker> hrm
[10:01:44] <toddparker> so there isn't a selector to just negate that when in a header
[10:03:12] <uGoMobi> toddparker: no, you would have to override it like I did in that PR
[10:03:40] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I just thought of one other possible solution... apply the glow only to buttons that are immediate children and add an box-shadow inherit rule for selects (those buttons are wrapped in a div)
[10:04:34] <uGoMobi> downside is that a soon as you wrap something in your markup it gets a different box-shadow style
[10:08:10] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=Popup&page=1&sort=updated&state=open
[10:08:47] <uGoMobi> I don't see any blockers so I think we can move on to beta or RC
[10:27:47] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i just checked the open issues that mention popup and don't see anything significant
[10:28:00] <uGoMobi> toddparker: same here
[10:28:09] <toddparker> cool
[10:28:15] <toddparker> on the glow…I dunno
[10:28:25] <toddparker> if we do remove it across the board
[10:30:02] <toddparker> maybe we could add a note in the docs about how to add it back in if you wanted that effect?
[10:30:10] <toddparker> i'm torn on it
[10:48:00] <toddparker> did you have a test page showing the removed?
[10:48:05] <toddparker> uGoMobi ^^
[10:49:01] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I have pointing to localhost, but I can simply create one
[10:49:34] <toddparker> johnbender, gseguin, _|Nix|_ - on nested lists, if you refresh or deep link to a url like this - error, endless spinner
[10:49:34] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-nested.html#&ui-page=0-0
[10:49:51] <toddparker> i checked back to 1.0.1 and still an issue there
[10:50:07] <toddparker> i thought we would simply show the parent (top level) list
[10:50:17] <toddparker> if we can't show the deep list
[10:50:49] <toddparker> uGoMobi: great
[10:52:40] <gseguin> toddparker: can we do 1.3 and drop nested listviews?
[10:56:03] <gseguin> that link doesn't work in 1.1-stable either
[11:04:51] <toddparker> ugh. i tried to drop nested list views pre-1.0 and we had loud loud dissenters
[11:05:08] <toddparker> people basically abuse that feature and stuff a whole site in it. gross.
[11:05:25] <toddparker> yeah, we must have broken that a long time ago
[11:05:55] <toddparker> canna just look for #&ui-page and just show the page itself
[11:06:07] <toddparker> jus tike we don't allow deep-linking to a popup
[11:06:16] <toddparker> that would at least fix it
[11:07:41] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: see this issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4797#issuecomment-7590679
[11:07:41] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4797 on jquery-mobile (webslash; 5d, 18h ago): JQM 1.2 Alpha: Popup with form quickly opens and closes android keyboard can't input text.
[11:08:38] <toddparker> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lxCgVX4m70&feature=youtu.be
[11:08:49] <toddparker> i can't reproduce on my 2.2 device or any android
[11:09:10] <toddparker> though when the keyboard opens, it does reposition and lose focus
[11:09:32] <toddparker> wonder if we can keep focus on the input when re-positioning. bet it would fix this.
[11:10:02] <toddparker> anyone have time to look at the nested list or popup issues today?
[11:10:24] <toddparker> not sure if _|Nix|_ is around so maybe gseguin or johnbender
[11:11:13] <uGoMobi> toddparker: test page http://jsbin.com/atahip/76
[11:17:11] <toddparker> thanks, looking...
[11:18:03] <uGoMobi> toddparker: we could also just remove it for bar A, the other ones you hardly see the issue
[11:19:49] <toddparker> the only thing is the buttons look non-round with the normal shadow
[11:19:58] <toddparker> see the gear icon?
[11:20:08] <toddparker> A could be any color
[11:20:37] <toddparker> hrm
[11:20:49] <toddparker> not convinced this is much of an issue
[11:20:58] <toddparker> mind linking up that test page to the issue?
[11:21:03] <toddparker> nice work
[11:22:00] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:23:53] <toddparker> what do you think?
[11:27:19] <uGoMobi> I dunno, it's really a small thing and it's only with bar A that it "disturbs" me
[11:27:48] <uGoMobi> but you are right that it could be any color
[11:28:49] <uGoMobi> so in general I don't think it's a good idea to have those kind of style adjustments in the theme CSS
[11:29:12] <uGoMobi> because you can't change it with TR
[11:33:06] <uGoMobi> BTW - the flip toggle; on Chrome I get cursor pointer when I hover "on" but cursur text when I hover "off"

[14:14:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and it times out on _all_ the tests?
[14:14:47] <johnbender> err
[14:14:50] <johnbender> all the test pages?
[14:15:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Mine doesn't output any of the ?jquery=version stuff though ...
[14:15:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... like it does on the CI server.
[14:15:24] <johnbender> orly?
[14:15:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can you gist the output?
[14:15:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Mine says "Testing kitchensink/"
[14:15:40] <johnbender> oh that's fine
[14:15:54] <johnbender> the ?jquery version thing is only when that's specified on the command line
[14:16:47] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: what's the command you're using
[14:17:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: https://gist.github.com/3298857
[14:17:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: take off the test/unit/
[14:17:52] <johnbender> *tests/unit
[14:17:57] <johnbender> it adds that for you
[14:18:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: *facepalm*
[14:18:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I added that in desperation, and it got stuck.
[14:19:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I wonder if I even needed that mod to js/jquery.testHelper.js
[14:19:38] <_|Nix|_> s@js@tests/unit@
[14:19:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I would take that out and try it first
[14:19:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah.
[14:20:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: A-OK.
[14:20:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nice work!
[14:21:35] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: awesome
[14:21:43] <johnbender> now you can run the suite locally
[14:21:46] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ^
[14:21:50] <johnbender> should be the same for you
[14:22:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah - great!
[14:22:13] <uGoMobi> hehe
[14:22:40] <uGoMobi> got phantomjs working?
[14:23:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Looks like ... I see prettiness in my console.
[14:23:17] <uGoMobi> nice :D
[14:29:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ johnbender : yeah, it works!
[14:29:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: good
[14:30:01] <johnbender> hopefully it stays that way :D
[14:30:16] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:30:20] <johnbender> doing that work for testswarm certainly stabilized the build
[14:30:21] <uGoMobi> johnbender: thanks!

[14:48:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup unit tests] Sequence for page -> popup -> dialog -> popup (Re: #4806) - Gabriel Schulhof
[14:48:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: What's up?
[14:49:23] <gseguin> hey can't a popup live outside a page and be referenced by several pages?
[14:49:48] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yes, but not with markup alone.
[14:50:12] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think you need to enhance it yourself.
[14:50:43] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: popup has code to add itself to the body if it can't find a .closest( ".ui-page" ).
[14:50:56] <gseguin> oh ok so you $( "#myId" ).popup() on it
[14:51:10] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I believe that should suffice.
[14:51:46] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Curious if the linking works without any additional help ...
[14:57:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Maybe I should make the link handler smart and enhance the popup if it finds it unenhanced: if ( !$( $link.attr( "href" ) ).data( "popup" ) && $( $link.attr( "href" ) ).is( $.mobile.popup.prototype.options.initSelector ) ) { $( $link.attr( "href" ) ).popup(); }
[14:57:46] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Then things would work as expected with markup alone.
[14:58:20] <gseguin> that sounds like a good idea
[14:58:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Though that's also a new feature, so maybe we should hold off until after 1.2 ... though I dunno - looks simple enough ...
[14:59:12] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Pingular!
[14:59:18] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ^^
[15:00:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_ gseguin : currently you have to enhance markup yourself indeed.... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4800
[15:03:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Youch! You're right - if I find the popup unenhanced, I must not only create the popup, but enhance its contents as well.
[15:03:27] <johnbender> toddparker: uGoMobi: does ui-disabled end up on the link itself in buttonMarkup?
[15:06:11] <uGoMobi> johnbender: do you mean if the class ui-disabled is added to the anchor element?
[15:07:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah
[15:07:14] <johnbender> ugh, "link"
[15:07:22] <uGoMobi> johnbender: then the answer is yes
[15:07:25] <johnbender> uGoMobi: thanks
[15:07:30] <uGoMobi> with button element it's different
[15:08:01] <uGoMobi> and input element

[15:35:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi:
[15:35:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the popup tests appear to be broken
[15:35:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[15:35:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ?
[15:36:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, it's a bit tricky. For example, listview /requires/ that it be part of a page.
[15:36:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if you try to make a popup menu by using a listview, you can't place the popup outside of a page.
[15:36:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, wasn't sure about that
[15:36:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah - pretty bad.
[15:37:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was hoping that when you trigger create on popup the same would happen as when you trigger it on a page... all child markup is enhanced
[15:39:07] <uGoMobi> but that magic doesn't work outside a page
[15:39:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, it is enhanced, however, there are widget that have things like this inside _create(): var thisPage = this.element.closest( ".ui-page" );
[15:39:11] <toddparker> sheesh. i'm back
[15:39:13] <toddparker> long meeting.
[15:39:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you add an element like that to the popup which is /not/ inside a page, it will break.

[15:39:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, too bad :(
[15:39:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's likely a timing issue then
[15:40:03] <johnbender> or that's the first place I would look
[15:40:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm pretty sure it is.
[15:40:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: does it pass both in the browser and on the command line?
[15:40:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Unfortunately.
[15:40:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yep.
[15:40:19] <johnbender> :( :(
[15:40:22] <johnbender> that's a huge bummer
[15:40:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But it passed in the browser only after I increased a timeout :( So, I'll make it even larger ...

[15:51:13] <toddparker> missed some popup fun today
[15:56:51] <toddparker> i think this is worth discussing - should we have an option to not include popups in history
[15:56:52] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4823#issuecomment-7598697
[15:57:54] <gseguin> but then how do you dismiss it with the back button?
[15:58:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: if you can bind to an event that would be great

[16:01:26] <johnbender> toddparker: I asked him what the issue with altering the url was
[16:01:36] <toddparker> johnbender: thanks for weighing in
[16:02:02] <toddparker> great you figured out that android bug
[16:02:24] <johnbender> toddparker: "figured out" => "hacked around"
[16:02:32] <toddparker> whatever means...
[16:03:14] <toddparker> not dealing with the history for popups isn't what we'd do be default, but i can see cases like an iPad only app where back button support may not be useful
[16:03:15] <johnbender> toddparker: one thing I'm going to check before leav that one is whether we get the same problem with plain ol' click
[16:03:31] <toddparker> navbar?
[16:03:46] <johnbender> yah
[16:03:56] <toddparker> back button business probably does slow down the popup stuff a bit
[16:03:58] <johnbender> toddparker: what's the downsidet to maintaining the history?
[16:04:13] <johnbender> hmm
[16:04:19] <johnbender> maybe, but I'm not sure
[16:04:21] <toddparker> mostly the url dropping, maybe added slowness
[16:04:38] <gseguin> toddparker: most of the builder's problems were due to metadata and files that should have been deleted in the workspace but were still there
[16:04:48] <gseguin> I took care of most of that
[16:04:54] <toddparker> but i agree that as a library, we need to care about back button support big time
[16:05:04] <toddparker> awesome gseguin
[16:07:11] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Went to brush my teeth. gseguin and I were thinking about enhancing a popup if a person clicks on a link that's supposed to bring up a popup, but the click handler finds that the popup hasn't been enhanced yet.
[16:07:29] <johnbender> toddparker: it's not vclick, same issue on click with the fixed navbar
[16:07:33] <johnbender> the hack will stand
[16:08:25] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: This would allow us to add a popup directly to the body, and use it from multiple pages without having to write any js.
[16:09:07] <toddparker> that would be cool _|Nix|_
[16:09:11] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The wrinkle is that the contents of such a popup would have to be enhanced as well, and some widgets (such as listview) are required to be on a page for enhancement to work.
[16:09:18] * johnbender puts on his old curmudgeon hat
[16:09:32] <johnbender> is this something user's will need :D
[16:09:35] <toddparker> sounds like some plugins like list view need to be more flexible how enhancing when outside the page
[16:09:36] <johnbender> or just something we want
[16:09:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Amen!
[16:09:50] <johnbender> toddparker: I'll second that
[16:10:09] <johnbender> coupled in a lot of ways
[16:10:18] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Anyway, long story short: Do we want this? Are we OK with this wrinkle? If so, do we squeeze it in before 1.2?
[16:10:20] <johnbender> theme inheritance for one
[16:10:33] * johnbender votes NO on proposition "remove the wrinkle"
[16:10:42] <toddparker> ha
[16:10:57] <toddparker> i think we should add this to the roadmap google doc
[16:11:15] <toddparker> but i think we shouldn't add anything for 1.2 unless it's a bag bug fix
[16:11:17] * _|Nix|_ go sleep now, leaving you guys with such things to ponder. I'll check in tomorrow to see what pearls have resulted from my irritants ;)
[16:11:44] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK, so, no matter what, it's post-1.2.
[16:11:50] * _|Nix|_ can sleep easier
[16:11:56] <toddparker> yes
