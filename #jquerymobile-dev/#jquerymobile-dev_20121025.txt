[04:21:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ping!
[04:40:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:hi
[04:41:01] <uGoMobi> hi arschmitz
[04:41:28] <uGoMobi> I saw the discussion yesterday about fixed toolbars
[04:41:47] <uGoMobi> how are we going to proceed?
[04:42:17] <uGoMobi> reason I asked is because I was looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4250
[04:42:54] <uGoMobi> Android 2.3 issue with fixed toolbars
[04:43:30] <uGoMobi> not sure if I should continue working on that or leave it for now
[04:43:42] <uGoMobi> same goes for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4069
[04:44:35] <arschmitz> im on my way into office give me ten minutes
[04:44:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure
[04:53:13] <arschmitz> those two issues yeah iv looked at both of those two
[04:54:14] <arschmitz> https://github.com/arschmitz/jquery-mobile/commit/3f5a5bba55584634d4224a62a33a1f9d4aba8ebb#commitcomment-2046348
[04:54:58] <arschmitz> so basicly kinda similar to what your doing with behivors just for browser specific workarounds
[04:56:47] <uGoMobi> right
[04:56:50] <arschmitz> so i think both of those issues would probably fall into that work arounds category
[04:57:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok thanks
[04:57:33] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will flag them "in review" as well
[04:58:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds good. id actually like to see your behivors extension when you finish it. i know there was a lot of discussion on exactly how to implement it and it seems like this should be done essentially the same way
[05:00:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: actually I think your bottom 0 solution could fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4250 as well
[05:01:40] <arschmitz> yeah very well may.
[05:02:11] <arschmitz> i almost forgot about that that deffinitly would fall into that workarounds group too.
[05:03:50] <uGoMobi> so I suggest we just continue with the fix you are working on and then test if fixes that one too
[05:04:13] <arschmitz> i gota make sure i get this work arounds extension right though. because its a bunch of sketchy solutions that i wouldnt want to go haywire lol!
[05:04:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds good
[05:08:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool!
[05:08:23] <uGoMobi> let me know when you need help
[05:08:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool thanks
[05:09:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: guess im jumping right in head first lol!
[05:09:42] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:12:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you guys are keeping me busy though lol! iv got that extension plus working on some new demos for the docs and have to prepare a 40 minute talk for jquery asia in two weeks
[05:14:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: well and try and do some triage too!
[05:14:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that's what happens when you show us skills like yours :D
[05:15:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ha ha thanks its an honor honestly
[05:16:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but of course we understand you have limited time available
[05:18:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Yeah luckyly my full time job allows me assign my time as i see fit, and since we have many websites running JQM i considder this in our own best intrest
[05:19:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we are very happy with all the work you are doing but it shouldn't put you under pressure
[05:20:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it by no means does. after many year of building their infrastructure here things have become very "self perpetuationg" which has freed up a lot of my time
[05:21:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nice :)
[05:21:50] <arschmitz> and since JQM is part of the structure i want to support it
[05:22:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I suggest to focus on the fixed toolbar stuff first next to your preparations for the asia conf talk
[05:23:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i also belive strongly in the future of the mobile web and touch devices and i think JQM is going to be important in that.
[05:23:32] <uGoMobi> and triage if you are bored while watching TV in bed ;-)
[05:23:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ha ha !
[05:23:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I totally agree
[05:26:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: seems we are the only two ever in here this time of day

[05:27:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and _|Nix|_ ;-)
[05:27:46] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks like you are an early starter
[05:28:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah up at 5 to work by 7:30 every morning
[05:28:27] <uGoMobi> wow
[05:29:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, you must get home early, right?
[05:29:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ha ha yeah and work till 6pm!
[05:29:14] <uGoMobi> I get up around 9 to start at 9.01 ;-)
[05:29:23] <_|Nix|_> :)
[05:30:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have a really long work day 7:30 - 6 i guess that helps with having free time too ha !
[05:30:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow, OK ... so much for getting home early ...
[05:31:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: magic... I just opened https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5189 to see what we could do about it and 10 secs you close it with your commit :)
[05:31:29] <uGoMobi> s/secs/secs later/
[05:33:14] <_|Nix|_> ?BOOM
[05:33:14] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[05:34:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, I think the popup needs some major cleanup. There are a lot of variables that are set when the popup starts opening, but are not set back when it has finished closing.
[05:34:32] <_|Nix|_> Currently, these do not cause incorrect behaviour, but they point to some flakiness.
[05:35:16] <_|Nix|_> I'd like to group those variables into an object which is instantiated when the popup starts to open and then destroyed when the popup is done closing.
[05:35:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 1.2-stable: http://git.io/JnKBYw
[05:35:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.2-stable] [popup] Correctly handle the case when the fallback transition is "none" -- Fixes #5189 - Gabriel Schulhof
[05:36:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that solution sounds good... I was just about to say that it is too bad that _destroy doesn't take care of that
[05:36:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not about _destroy. It's about open/close.
[05:37:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: _destroy really does destroy - everything.
[05:37:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That which you build up during open, must be torn down during close, so that the entire state of the popup is the same after completing close that it was before starting open.
[05:38:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, I misunderstood the original problem
[05:39:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Currently, for example, if you have a popup who's transition is, say, "flip", and then you open it from a link that has data-transition="none", it opens correctly with no transition, but while it's open, the value of _fallbackTransition remains "flip" (or "fade", or whatever the degraded transition is specified as), instead of being set to "".
[05:40:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, it needs some internal state cleanup.
[05:40:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see what problems that can cause
[05:40:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... without breaking any behaviour.
[05:41:05] <uGoMobi> of course, we never break anything :)
[05:49:01] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[05:49:02] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #785: FIXED in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/785/
[06:04:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: What's up with this (bug I just filed)? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5220
[06:09:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you test with other website with a name that is at least as long as "jQuery Mobile"?
[06:09:16] <arschmitz> its automatic based on the site title
[06:09:54] <arschmitz> the title of that page is too long jQuery Mobile Docs - Configuration
[06:10:08] <arschmitz> so thats where it truncates to
[06:11:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The thing is, I can add the letter and it's fine. I guess it picks the first n characters by default, which happens to truncate us to off-by-a-letter.
[06:12:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: exactly it always take first 12 i think
[06:12:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll close it.
[06:12:41] <uGoMobi> we could fix this by changing the name of the project ;-)
[06:12:46] <_|Nix|_> :)
[06:12:48] <arschmitz> i tried a page titled just jQuery Mobile and it does the same
[06:13:21] <_|Nix|_> ... until Apple decides to change their policy, or whatever.
[06:15:46] <uGoMobi> BTW - personally I think it's better if we change the order of the title, like... Config - jQuery Mobile
[06:16:09] <uGoMobi> makes it more clear in search results what page you are about to visit
[06:17:08] <arschmitz> thats a pretty common convention now too
[06:17:09] <uGoMobi> the url shown at the search result already makes clear it is a page at the jquerymobile domain
[06:18:14] <uGoMobi> titles are often truncated, also on tabs of desktop browsers
[06:18:45] <arschmitz> but the icon is always there which will generally be recognised
[06:18:54] <uGoMobi> exactly
[06:19:26] <arschmitz> lol im terrible with tabs most of the time i have so many open the ico is all i see!
[06:19:42] <uGoMobi> I hear you ;)
[06:20:48] <arschmitz> i love that about modren computers the ability to keep a virtualy unlimted number for windows or programs open with out issues!
[06:21:25] <_|Nix|_> Wow! 5153 is awesome! Try this: 1. open a popup in portrait. 2. Rotate to landscape. 3. Rotate 180°. Popup disappears.
[06:21:39] <arschmitz> oh yeah iv looked at that one
[06:21:52] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, 1. Open a popup in landscape. 2. Rotate 180°. Popup stays on screen.
[06:22:08] <uGoMobi> can't we sell that as a feature?
[06:22:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think I've found a rock-solid way to repro it though.
[06:22:13] <_|Nix|_> :)
[06:22:31] <arschmitz> yeah i could every time
[06:22:36] <arschmitz> in ios 6
[06:22:46] <arschmitz> couldnt do it in 5 though
[06:23:00] <_|Nix|_> So, at first glance it looks like the repositioning logic breaks something that stays broken the next time a repositioning sequence needs to take place.
[06:23:20] <_|Nix|_> Another example of improper state cleanup, looks like.
[06:23:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: could you do it on ios5?
[06:23:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wish I had an iOS5 device at my disposal.
[06:23:58] <arschmitz> i have 2 any time
[06:24:04] <arschmitz> iphone and ipad
[06:25:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, can you try the above two sequences on iOS 5?
[06:26:17] <arschmitz> both actually do it in ios5
[06:26:35] <arschmitz> any 180 turn from landscape seems to do it
[06:26:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Excellent! That points to a logic error.
[06:27:21] <arschmitz> oh i forgot my ipad ios5 ipad at home but i bet its any 180
[06:27:31] <arschmitz> cant do a portrait 180 on iphone
[06:29:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: just a stab but i bet when it does a fluid 180 turn it only fires one orientation change vs two so the logic is trying to position it in the wrong orientation?
[06:30:36] <_|Nix|_> I think it fires orientation change, which causes the popup to be hidden, but there are no subsequent resizes, which, once they pass, cause the popup to be shown again.
[06:30:51] <_|Nix|_> s/, cause/, would cause/
[06:31:08] <arschmitz> if i stop for even a fraction of a second second vs it being completely fluid it works fine
[06:31:56] <arschmitz> ah actually i think your right
[06:32:53] <arschmitz> when i turn 180 it never attempts a resize it just flips
[06:33:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's smart, so I need to match its smarts.
[06:33:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it does look that way ha ha
[06:34:56] <arschmitz> maybe look at how the fixed toolbars do it they seem to handle it fine?
[06:35:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, they're fixed, right, so the browser handles it for them.
[06:35:28] <arschmitz> ah yeah true
[06:35:49] <arschmitz> and actually playing with it more they arnt hiding like the pop up they are simply frozen then repositioned
[06:36:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly. I wanted it to be hidden, so you don't get the seized-up-looking in-between frames.
[06:36:47] <arschmitz> if only there where an "orientationChangeComplete" event ha ha
[06:37:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, yeah. But, I figure, if I handle the orientationchange like a resize, then the logic which happens at the end of the resize storm will happen immediately - IOW, the popup will be shown.
[06:38:29] * _|Nix|_ is off instrumenting things to observe the sequence of events
[06:38:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: makes sense should look well too just a quick hide
[06:44:20] <gseguin>  mornin'
[06:46:13] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Good morning!
[06:46:30] <arschmitz> morning gseguin
[06:47:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's a one-liner. I merely needed to initiate the look-for-resizes sequence from the orientationchange handler.
[06:48:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nice always good when things are easy and uncomplicated much more like to be reliable!
[06:52:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When things are easy, I make them complicated. I moved the rapid-hide logic into the resize event. So, if there's only orientationchange and nothing else, there should be no hiding. That prevents the popup from blinking out and in when you do a 180° rotation.
[06:52:55] <arschmitz> perfect it will look perfect and smooth
[06:53:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I hope it will continue to be correct though.
[06:53:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... on all platforms.
[06:55:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah ANDROID! but it should i think. becasue if there is a resize on 180 in another platform it should just blink out quickly (like it already does on 90)
[06:55:53] <arschmitz> but will still resize and show correctly after the blink
[06:59:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, the result looks good, and only hides if there's a resize.
[07:00:04] <arschmitz> awesome it sounded like it should work exactly as you intended with the changes
[07:09:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Android 2.3.5 does not appear to be any worse ...
[07:10:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ awesome that always seems to be the worst
[07:10:46] <toddmparker> arschmitz: did you see my comment re: your talk? Things get lost on IRC
[07:11:06] <toddmparker> Anyway, description looks great, just suggested a snappier title
[07:11:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:im geting an 2.3.7 device for testing tomorrow i cant belive they are still patching it ha ha
[07:12:28] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yes thank you i changed the title. perfectly wrong timing i checked my work didnt see it and then sent asking and apparently inbetween my checking and asking (switching users) you answered
[07:14:04] <_|Nix|_> Aaah, yes. Concurrency and synchronization ...

[07:33:14] <toddmparker> hey all
[07:33:53] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: I've been seeing the popup re-position to the center when you open it at first, like you did an orientation change or resize
[07:34:04] <toddmparker> is that related to these fixes? iOS6
[07:36:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I've seen that too - does it happen often?
[07:36:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: There must be a resize going on.
[07:37:22] <toddmparker> it was happening pretty consistently for me on iOS6
[07:38:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Lemme guess: iPad?
[07:39:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It seems to happen the first time you open a popup after a scroll.
[07:40:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Maybe it has to do with the hiding of the scrollbar.
[07:42:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah ... scroll to a place that has popup launchers, and quickly launch a popup.
[07:42:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: When the popup's appearance is followed by a reposition, it looks as though the entire page scrolls a little. Are you seeing that too?
[07:43:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Unrelated: Is johnbender around? He was heading for Tucson yesterday ... does that mean he's off? I'd really like his take on the third implementation of the form reset handling.
[07:44:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm pretty sure the final solution will look like that, but still ...

[07:53:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: NP.
[07:54:35] <toddmparker> try this page on your iOS device
[07:54:36] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/tables/docs/tables/index.html
[07:54:48] <toddmparker> open the "Columns…" popup
[07:55:06] <toddmparker> happens every time, first time
[07:56:25] <toddmparker> or even on the popup page in the docs
[07:56:25] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[07:56:42] <toddmparker> click on the menu example, it will open over the button, then shift to the center
[07:56:52] <toddmparker> it's a problem for narrower popups
[07:57:16] <toddmparker> didn't used to do that earlier
[07:57:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: For me it only does it the first time I open a popup after a scroll, and usually only after a scroll down.

[08:17:15] <toddmparker> hrm
[08:17:20] <toddmparker> that is a bad one
[08:17:36] <toddmparker> think we need to re-look at the positioning
[08:17:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'll check out the event sequence ...
[08:17:55] <toddmparker> jzaefferer: I just commented on that issue
[08:18:04] <toddmparker> thought there was a prototype of that somewhere
[08:18:11] <toddmparker> ok _|Nix|_
[08:19:14] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Re: NuGet... I wonder if that's also possible without making changes in our code (which we would have to maintain). Maybe something we can ask Damian Edwards who seems to be the guy who maintains the Mobile and other jQuery packages (http://nuget.org/packages?q=jquery)
[08:19:32] <uGoMobi> I am not really familiar with Visual Studio or NuGet
[08:19:37] <scottjehl__> heyo
[08:19:49] <uGoMobi> hey scottjehl__
[08:20:06] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I can confirm that a resize occurs after the popup has been opened - for some reason.
[08:23:09] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: this was for hooking in with themes somehow
[08:23:23] <toddmparker> damian was on the original thread so he's been giving feedback
[08:23:38] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: very odd.
[08:23:50] <toddmparker> hey scottjehl__
[08:26:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah ... I don't get why there's a resize, and, unfortunately, the only workaround is another timeout. Like, ignore resizes for, like, 200 ms after the popup opens - but that's obviously bad, because it'll reduce the accuracy of the resize/orientationchange detection.
[08:27:46] <tybenz> toddmparker_: ping
[08:30:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm gonna compare window size during open to window size during the spurious resize event.
[08:31:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes I understand, didn't know Damian was already involved though...  was just thinking about who is going to maintain that code
[08:31:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, weird. During open, the height is 417, and it issues a resize because the height shrinks to 416 ...
[08:31:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Might this have to do something with the CSS pixels?
[08:33:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Then again, sometimes it's happy to stay at 417 ...
[08:34:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Can you check out this weirdness with iOS5? Do popups appear, then reposition themselves after a brief stint on the screen?
[08:34:40] <arschmitz> no problem
[08:35:31] <_|Nix|_> I can't imagine what could be causing this ...
[08:40:51] <arschmitz> i could only get it to happen once
[08:41:06] <arschmitz> and it was with the video example so im betting unrelated
[08:41:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, but it does happen ..
[08:42:10] <arschmitz> like i said only once and on the video example which resizes the video to fit the iframe to screen so im not sure its related
[08:45:11] <arschmitz> actually the video one first time i open it after a refresh is wonky
[08:45:19] <arschmitz> it opens fine
[08:45:28] <_|Nix|_> But then?
[08:45:29] <_|Nix|_> :)
[08:45:31] <arschmitz> then it scrolls me to the top of the screen
[08:45:37] <_|Nix|_> O_o
[08:45:42] <arschmitz> and the popup stays where it was
[08:45:55] <uGoMobi> the video example sets the popup container to the correct size on the popupbeforeposition event
[08:46:17] <uGoMobi> there shouldn't be a resize after the popup has opened
[08:46:39] <arschmitz> well im not actually sure if its a resize it scrolls me to the top of screen so i cant see it any more
[08:46:54] <uGoMobi> ah i see
[08:46:55] <arschmitz> im not sure what exactly is happening to cause it
[08:47:36] <arschmitz> but if i close it and open it again it dosent happen
[08:47:45] <arschmitz> its only the first time its opened
[08:48:47] <_|Nix|_> I can think of two browser bugs: 1. When you scroll, it recalculates the logical pixels, and it's off-by-one because of rounding errors. 2. The window size really does change when you scroll, and it stays that way until you do something.
[08:49:20] <_|Nix|_> It doesn't have to do with the fact that the popup manipulates the browser history either.
[08:49:30] <_|Nix|_> I turned off history and it was still happening.
[08:50:00] <arschmitz> i think the video popup scrolling is because the iframe issues a hashchange when it goes from displaying an image to the video
[08:50:54] <arschmitz> because the map example dosent do it
[08:51:24] <arschmitz> and it seems to scroll when this change occures
[08:52:00] <arschmitz> on subsequent openings its already at video so no hash change
[08:55:57] <arschmitz> ios6 does the same
[08:56:25] <arschmitz> also only happens if the page has been scrolled if your already at the top it of course does nothing
[08:57:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I hooked up a handler to the "scroll" event that prints out the window position and size, and sometimes it magically goes from 416 to 417 ...
[08:58:54] <arschmitz> restarting be back shortly!
[09:00:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It also goes back. So, if you keep scrolling, sometimes you'll see a height of 416, sometimes 417, sometimes 416 again ...
[09:00:55] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: When you open the popup while the height happens to be 417, it decides to do a resize while your popup is open ...
[09:09:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the change on scrolling explains something that was driving me nuts once in a while i was getting -1 on a claculation that should always be zero (assuming window height dosent change!)

[09:15:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/tables] made the sorter work at pageinit - Scott Jehl
[09:15:49] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: maybe we need to introduce a threshold where the resize needs to be more than ~5px to be worth re-positioning
[09:15:55] <_|Nix|_> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/375
[09:15:58] <_|Nix|_> Enjoy!
[09:16:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Excellent idea!
[09:16:29] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: what is the jsbin
[09:16:30] <_|Nix|_> Open ^ and pan around.
[09:16:41] <toddmparker> on an iphone?
[09:16:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Shows window coords and dimensions in a fixed header.
[09:16:51] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah.
[09:17:15] <toddmparker> ah, i see
[09:17:16] <_|Nix|_> It's like 416 ... 416 ... 417 ... 417 ... 417 ... 416 ...  416 ...
[09:17:22] <_|Nix|_> *shake head*
[09:17:26] <toddmparker> on desktop like chrome, it's constant
[09:17:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Of course.
[09:17:33] <toddmparker> think this might be sub pixel jitters
[09:17:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think so too ...
[09:17:46] <toddmparker> wonder if mat can see it on his retina macbook
[09:18:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Test ALL iDevices!
[09:18:23] <_|Nix|_> s/iD/(i|mac)D/
[09:18:40] <arschmitz> wow on ios5 i get everything between 305 and 350!
[09:18:50] <_|Nix|_> D0000d!
[09:19:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: This pretty much nixes your idea about ~5px ...
[09:19:13] <arschmitz> its insane!
[09:19:21] <_|Nix|_> Dafuq?!
[09:20:05] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: On second thought, we can introduce an epsilon, because at least iOS6 will benefit.
[09:20:18] <arschmitz> ios6 ipad is rock solid
[09:20:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Did you test both orientations on all of those devices?
[09:20:50] * _|Nix|_ grab droid 2.3 ...
[09:20:55] <toddmparker> I only see a 1px shift in height (last number)
[09:21:11] <arschmitz> but i just got a 378 on the iphone
[09:21:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: On iOS6, right?
[09:21:13] <Wilto> Yo.
[09:21:30] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Right on queue :)
[09:21:44] <arschmitz> ipad i cant get it to change at all landscape or portrait
[09:22:13] <arschmitz> im going to go get my ios5 ipad to see what happens be back in a bit
[09:22:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice! Maybe it's the processor ... got some floating point issues ...
[09:22:52] <_|Nix|_> ... if the problem is confined to non-iPads, i mean.
[09:23:22] <toddmparker> iOS6 on an iPhone5 and iPad3
[09:23:26] <toddmparker> but just 1px
[09:23:39] <Wilto> No issue on my Retinarök machine.
[09:23:41] <_|Nix|_> So much for my theory :)
[09:23:42] <arschmitz> ios6 ipad2 is rock solid
[09:23:45] <toddmparker> not a problem on a retina macbook
[09:24:05] <toddmparker> so it's just a bug with iOS6 and fixed toolbars
[09:24:10] <toddmparker> which isn't surprising
[09:24:11] <_|Nix|_> Well, lemme add iOS6 iPod touch to that list.
[09:24:13] <danheberden> lol @ retinarök
[09:24:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: fixed toolbars?
[09:24:34] <arschmitz> toddmparker: no it must be device because no change on ios6 ipad 2
[09:24:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Why do those come into play?
[09:24:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Do you think the problem is absent on pages that have no fixed elements?
[09:25:03] <toddmparker> so arschmitz - you're seeing that last number vary by more than 1px?
[09:25:28] <Wilto> danheberden: http://wil.to/retinarok.png
[09:25:30] <arschmitz> on ios5 iphone 4 it varies by up to 80. on ipad2 ios6 it never changes
[09:25:52] <toddmparker> what's wacky
[09:26:00] <Wilto> _Eighty_.
[09:26:01] <toddmparker> *that's*
[09:26:02] <Wilto> Man.
[09:26:24] <arschmitz> im going to go get my ios5 ipad 2 now to see what happens ill let you know ( have to run home for it)
[09:26:44] <danheberden> Wilto: is that `kill gods -9` ?
[09:27:10] <toddmparker> charging out iOS5 phone
[09:27:44] <_|Nix|_> danheberden, Wilto: :)
[09:27:49] <Wilto> Lotta nerd in that sentence, danheberden. Lotta nerd.
[09:29:21] <danheberden> Wilto: at least i didn't bring up final fantasy 8
[09:29:23] <Wilto> Yeah, seeing the 1px shift on iOS 5 iPad.
[09:30:01] <Wilto> cough cloud’s second best weapon in final fantasy vii cough
[09:30:17] <danheberden> Wilto well now i'm just impressed
[09:31:18] <danheberden> and who doesn't love triple materia growth I MEAN COME ON
[09:31:24] <Wilto> +1
[09:31:28] <Wilto> Er, +3.
[09:31:32] <danheberden> anyway, i've distracted y'all enough ;)
[09:35:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/389 tells me that it's independent of fixed headers.
[09:39:47] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: think this is just a bug in retina iOS
[09:39:58] <toddmparker> good to know there's a real cause
[09:40:25] <toddmparker> gseguin: can you review this PR from Greg - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5205
[09:40:30] <arschmitz> ok so ignore previous iphone 5 comments
[09:40:52] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah? why?
[09:41:01] <arschmitz> i havent been able to do again it must have loaded weird
[09:41:28] <arschmitz> it now has 1px varience
[09:41:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK ... maybe it was the appearance of the location bar?
[09:42:11] <arschmitz> but ipad 2 ios5 zero change rock solid
[09:43:07] <arschmitz> which points to retina i think
[09:43:51] <_|Nix|_> I don't get all this retina thing. So, you guys think it's a bug in the iOS6 software?
[09:44:27] <_|Nix|_> ... because Wilto was seeing it on iOS5 iPad ...
[09:44:40] <arschmitz> no ios6 ipad 2 does not do it
[09:44:54] <Wilto> Retina iOS 5 iPad, mind you.
[09:45:21] <_|Nix|_> For crying out loud! So many products, so little mind.
[09:45:30] <arschmitz> all retina ios devices do it non retina dont so far
[09:45:50] <_|Nix|_> What makes a device "retina"? Is it a hardware feature?
[09:46:58] <_|Nix|_> Just curious, is all - my learning this bit of information will not prevent me from having to do an epsilon-check instead of an exact equality check in popup.
[09:48:10] <arschmitz> yes itsva type of screen
[09:49:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Interesting - this might have bubbled all the way up the stack down from the hardware.
[09:49:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because I bet the CSS pixel scaling is being calculated based on physical device properties.
[09:49:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and the values obtained from the retina hardware cause a floating point instability.
[09:50:25] <arschmitz> makes sense
[09:50:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, but wait a second! My dinky iPod with iOS6 also has the jitters.
[09:50:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: How do I check if mine is also a retina device?
[09:51:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Does the word "retina" appear anywhere in the UI to signal that it is indeed a retina device?
[09:51:35] * _|Nix|_ looks for the about product thingy ...
[09:52:00] <arschmitz> look up the generation im not sure what if any ipods have it
[09:52:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK, I have some model number version serial number that kind of thing ...
[09:54:01] <_|Nix|_> Argh! Fat chance I'll find a model number -> feature list lookup table anywhere ...
[09:54:16] <arschmitz> 4th gen and new ipod touch have it
[09:55:45] <_|Nix|_> OK ... mine might actually have a retina display.
[09:59:18] <gseguin> toddmparker: absolutely, I was planning on doing that today
[10:05:05] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: if the text looks really crisp, it's retina
[10:05:36] <toddmparker> there is some calculations that map pixels to device-pixels and you can see rounding issues there
[10:05:52] <toddmparker> which is why fixed positioning had a jitter on iOS 5
[10:06:10] <toddmparker> think it was a just jiggling by 1 pixel = 1/2 screen pixel
[10:06:15] <toddmparker> math is hard
[10:06:22] <toddmparker> so a threshold might be fine
[10:06:33] <toddmparker> agenda for today, please fill this out

[10:07:59] <toddmparker> I think you're pretty much a team member now, been cranking
[10:08:21] <toddmparker> usually we wait a bit longer, but I have a feeling you're not going anywhere
[10:10:49] <toddmparker> gseguin: thanks for reviewing that, but good to keep him going
[10:16:10] <arschmitz> nice thank you toddmparker and now promise i wont go anywhere lol
[10:18:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Go wherever you wish, just stay within arm's length of #jquerymobile-dev ;)
[10:18:51] <arschmitz> ha ha
[10:19:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Reminds me of this guy who's the original author of a certain OSS tool (named tracker). He lives on this paradise island and does nothing all day except hack on that.
[10:20:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and then my wife shakes me out of my sleep and shoves a garbage bag in my face: "Your turn!"
[10:20:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: :)
[10:21:45] <arschmitz> and besides im only an hour drive from toddmparker and wilto they could hunt me down
[10:25:34] <toddmparker> we're outside your office on stakeout
[10:25:47] <toddmparker> wilt…hand me another donut
[10:26:06] <kpepin> Nice.
[10:26:54] <kpepin> brb
[10:28:18] <Wilto> We both grew badass mustaches just to complete the “stakeout” vibe.
[10:32:05] <arschmitz> toddmparker: wilto: good thing im at home ha ha
[10:33:13] <arschmitz> Knew i shouldnt have given toddmparker a link to a page that gives real time turn by turn to my office!
[10:35:24] <arschmitz> led them right to me
[10:38:48] <frequent> mh... so you speak in secret issue numbers, have a stakeout widget and grow mustaches....
[10:39:01] <frequent> where is the recruiting form... :-)
[10:50:43] <kpepin> Anyone got a minute for a stupid GitHub question?

[10:52:48] <kpepin> I am trying to get a couple of files I worked on at the summit into the listview-grid branch Scott J. and I createdat the summit.  Un fortunately, there have also been changes to another file besides the oens I worked on sicne the summit.
[10:53:11] <kpepin> When I try to make the pull request, I seem to be in danger of overrighting that other file with my out of date version.  :P
[10:53:18] <kpepin> Do not want that.
[10:53:31] <arschmitz> pull his change first if its all different files
[10:53:34] <kpepin> How can I omit the other file from the pull request using the web interface for GitHub?
[10:53:54] <arschmitz> oh web interface i dont think you can
[10:54:02] <kpepin> Damn it.  :P
[10:54:06] <kpepin> :)
[10:54:39] <arschmitz> most stuff you have to use git on your computer for the web interface is very limited
[10:55:59] <kpepin> I also have SmartGit on my laptop, but I admit to being unfamiliar with the Git tools in general, and don't want to mess it up.  Last Pull Request was accidentally sent to the main branch and not the offshoot one we created due to inexperience.  :P
[10:56:27] <arschmitz> yeah you would need to clone your fork
[10:56:48] <arschmitz> then add the main repo as an upstream
[10:57:05] <arschmitz> and merge your work with the upstream
[10:57:26] <arschmitz> push back to your fork
[10:57:32] <arschmitz> then do the pr
[10:57:40] <arschmitz> oh and make sure your on the right branch the whole time
[10:59:01] <gseguin> pull it stage it stash it commit it pull it push it stop unstash it

[12:05:47] <toddmparker> Hey tybenz
[12:06:05] <toddmparker> btw - I just asked mauriceG for cool jsbins and help with the 1.1.2 changelog
[12:08:24] <agcolom> sorry my internet connection keeps playing around today! I keep on getting disconnected!
[12:14:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you get Basecamp notifications?
[12:26:01] <agcolom> toddmparker: to answer your question on place for data-ref in api docs: Yes, I think so
[12:27:13] <gnarf> gseguin: you around?
[12:27:49] <gnarf> gseguin: I'm going to reinstall download builder using jqdeploy - also I should have this setup to be able to accept the post-receives
[12:28:28] <gnarf> the user "jqdeploy" instead of "www-data" will be owning the builder
[12:54:24] <agcolom> toddmparker: I thought the view source was going to be in the api docs. Do we want it there as well ?

[13:41:15] <gseguin> want me to push something else?
[13:41:38] <gnarf> if you want to dbl check that it works yourself sure
[13:41:42] <gnarf> but i'm confident :)
[13:42:30] <gseguin> done

[14:27:00] <gseguin> so are we releasing 1.1.2?
[14:27:10] <gseguin> lets do this thing
[14:37:35] <_|Nix|_> Wow! Insanity: During scroll, the window height is 417, but during popup open it's 416 ... so, there's no need to do an epsilon-based compare of window dimensions. I need only store window dimension measurements during open so that when the spurious resize event arrives, I can compare window dimensions precisely, and find that they have not changed, so no need to hide/reposition/show the popup!
[14:38:05] <_|Nix|_> What a whacky workaround ...
[14:38:14] <_|Nix|_> I call it "detached retina".
[14:43:33] <_|Nix|_> When I open a popup during the whacky 417px phase, the whole page adjusts itself slightly.
[14:44:15] <_|Nix|_> It's barely perceptible ...
[14:46:21] <toddmparker> sorry all, catching up
[14:46:44] <toddmparker> agcolom - we can add the view source to the API docs once it's built for sure
[14:49:47] <toddmparker> gseguin: I'm all for getting 1.1.2 out, but I don't have a change log or blog post written :)
[14:50:13] <gseguin> does it really need a blog post?
[14:50:46] <toddmparker> think so. we've always done a blog post with change log
[14:51:03] <toddmparker> and we need to update the site - download page, homepage, etc.
[14:51:10] <gseguin> true
[14:51:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: crazy
[14:51:13] <toddmparker> download builder
[14:51:20] <toddmparker> woah tiger
[14:52:27] <gseguin> ok, well let me know when I need to update the builder, gnarf just added the auto-update on commit for the front-end so it's super fast to update now
[14:53:01] <toddmparker> cool
[14:54:39] <toddmparker> working on how to deal with colspan THs with RWD tables - http://jquerymobile.com/branches/tables/docs/tables/column-financial.html
[14:55:00] <toddmparker> think this is as complex as we'll ever want to support
[14:55:59] <gseguin> do you even want to go there?
[14:58:13] <toddmparker> if if can be done simply, sure
[14:58:26] <toddmparker> i know we use a ton of table like this in client work
[14:58:48] <toddmparker> the code so far for both table modes are really tiny
[14:59:07] <toddmparker> if this ends up getting complex, we can bail
[15:05:20] <arschmitz> i really like these tables im going to use them in my own client stuff for sure!
[15:08:30] <toddmparker> it solves a really hard problem
[15:08:57] <toddmparker> that's what the framework is supposed to do - hit the hard stuff and let people do the things they already know how to do
[15:09:15] <toddmparker> like styling these tables - if we keep it super minimal people can do whatever they want
[15:09:39] <toddmparker> easy enough to throw a ton of button classes onto each cell and make it look like a grid
[15:10:16] <toddmparker> but the hard part is generating the column popup or the technique to make the table appear to stack.

[15:10:28] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup] "detached retina" fix - the window height on iStuff with a retina display seems to fluctuate by one pixel during scroll, causing a spurious resize event right after popup open, even though window size is constant during the entire opening sequence - Gabriel Schulhof
[15:11:48] <toddmparker> _maybeRefreshTimeout
[15:12:05] <toddmparker> Seems like an interesting name
[15:13:22] <toddmparker> why the maybe?
[15:13:42] <toddmparker> also, we do need to clean up the coupling with selects

[15:13:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup] Rename function _maybeRefreshTimeout to _expectResizeEvent - Gabriel Schulhof
[15:13:58] <toddmparker> that means there is a dependency with custom selects
[15:14:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, that should be, like, ui-popup-hidden ...
[15:14:07] <toddmparker> right on
[15:15:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It hearkens back to the time of popup's birth.
[15:15:26] <toddmparker> where it all began
[15:15:57] <toddmparker> scott logged an issue for that class coupling yesterday so if you change that, be sure to close that issue
[15:16:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Can you throw a number my way?
[15:18:24] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5217
[15:18:34] <toddmparker> I just assigned it to you
[15:18:48] <toddmparker> ui-popup-hidden is good
[15:20:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK.
[15:22:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: _maybeRefreshTimeout referred to refreshing a timeout only if the window size had changed from that which was on record.

[15:22:44] <gseguin>   gcfrdew[KP0 CVSW2Q
[15:23:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Exactly! Far more cryptic than _maybeRefreshTimeout ...
[15:24:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's basically a debounce.
[15:25:19] <gseguin> sorry, beer landed on keyboard
[15:25:28] <gseguin> had to wipe quickly
[15:26:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Well then, I wish to express my sincere thanks to your beer for having helped me illustrate my point ;)
[15:26:07] <RWhitbeck> gseguin totally understandable…hope it didn't go to waste.
[15:27:31] <gseguin> RWhitbeck: I saved most of it
