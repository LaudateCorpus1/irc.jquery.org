[05:44:36] <_|Nix|_> Great! jshint gets confused by regex ... wonderful ...
[05:44:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: seriously?
[05:45:31] <arschmitz> thats seems like a major issue regex are kinda a fundamental part of JS
[05:46:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: While fixing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5893, I did this:
[05:46:15] <_|Nix|_> 					escapeId = function( id ) {
[05:46:17] <_|Nix|_> 						return id.replace( /([!"#$%&'()*+,./:;<=>?@[\]^`{|}~])/g, "\\$1" );
[05:46:21] <_|Nix|_> 					}
[05:46:25] <_|Nix|_> This is perfectly valid and works fine ...
[05:46:48] <_|Nix|_> Just doesn't lint ...
[05:46:54] <arschmitz> yeah i cant see anything wrong there
[05:47:12] <_|Nix|_> It's a character class, fer cryin' out-loud!
[05:48:01] <_|Nix|_> Granted, it also confuses my editor's syntax highlighting, but still ..
[05:48:44] <_|Nix|_> I'll try rephrasing the regex as a string ...
[05:48:49] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:49:00] <arschmitz> maybe try assigning it to a var?
[05:49:12] <arschmitz> i dunno it should work as is
[05:50:49] <arschmitz> regex are both wonderful and terrible all at once
[05:51:08] <_|Nix|_> Argh ... this is annoying ...
[05:51:08] <arschmitz> in the hands of someone that does not know what they are doing they can be SOOOO dangerous 
[05:51:24] <arschmitz> yet when used right they can be super powerful and really simplify code
[05:51:37] <_|Nix|_> I wish I could just put jshint-ignore-me brackets around the code ...
[05:51:59] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:53:25] <_|Nix|_> OK, well ... I don't belive linting is fatal to the build, so ... whatever ...
[05:54:11] <arschmitz> whats the jshint error your getting on it?

[07:20:09] <arschmitz> i dont think there is a reasonable way around this kinda thinking we should just document this as a limitation of the framework
[07:22:20] <gseguin> arschmitz: I don't see why it makes it harder to unit test, if he's using qunit attaching to $( "#qunit-fixture" ) should work just fine
[07:22:34] <arschmitz> gseguin i agree
[07:22:58] <gseguin> but it is kind of annoying that we can't enhance when not attached to the dom
[07:23:06] <gseguin> for other reasons
[07:23:15] <arschmitz> i agree 
[07:23:29] <arschmitz> but im not sure its going to be possible we use attributes too much
[07:27:03] <arschmitz> can get an attribute of something that is not yet in the dom
[07:27:09] <arschmitz> can't
[07:30:44] <arschmitz> actually it looks like you can im wrong hmm might have to look into this more
[07:31:09] <arschmitz> oh but not by using selectors only by working directly on the fragment
[07:31:24] <arschmitz> hmmm this would be really complicated to make work i feel like
[07:33:25] <arschmitz> it would involve using no selectors in any widget lol

[11:20:03] <gseguin> jrburke: sorry I did a ping and run
[11:20:22] <gseguin> I had a question regarding the logger in r.js
[11:20:55] <gseguin> jrburke: is it possible to redefine it and set the print function to my logging function?
[11:23:01] <jrburke> gseguin: logger uses env!env/print to do the printing. are you runnnig this in node? you require('r.js') then call requirejs.optimize?
[11:23:16] <gseguin> correct
[11:24:30] <jrburke> gseguin: ok, so if you do requirejs.define('node/print', function () {}) right before calling requirejs.optimize, that may work. where your print module should return a function like this: https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/jslib/node/print.js
[11:25:05] <gseguin> darn, I tried that jrburke
[11:25:09] <gseguin> let me try again
[11:27:04] <jrburke> hmm. ok. i'll try too...
[11:27:43] <gseguin> jrburke: it does work!
[11:27:48] <gseguin> thanks!
[11:27:53] <jrburke> great!
[11:28:02] <gseguin> I don't know what I messed up the first time
[11:28:17] <jrburke> ordering is important. define will need to happen first
[11:28:38] <gseguin> I had done it globally
[11:28:49] <gseguin> instead of right before the call to .optimize
[11:28:49] <jrburke> also a bit tricky with the requirejs.define thing

[11:41:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Is there a way to configure grunt-contrib-jshint to pull jshint-1.1.0 instead of jshint-0.9.1, which is what it does now?
[11:41:50] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I doubt it as this is in the package.json
[11:42:07] <gseguin> so not runtime configurable
[11:42:15] <gseguin> you can do it locally though
[11:43:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Nah ... I need it done globally, otherwise linting will fail, even though the code is perfectly correct.
[11:44:18] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Is it OK if I push a change that will make linting fail?
[11:44:37] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I haven't found a way to turn off linting for a section of code.
[11:45:44] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Apparently grunt-contrib-jshint does use jshint 1.1.0 ... https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint/issues/44
[11:45:55] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: no
[11:46:07] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: because travis won't be happy
[11:46:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK. I'll try a workaround ...
[11:49:14] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: maybe we're not using the latest version of grunt-contrib-jshint
[11:49:15] <gseguin> ?
[11:49:49] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Nono ...
[11:50:04] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: we can pull it from github
[11:50:07] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: grunt-contrib-jshint v0.1.1 uses jshint 0.9.1 ...
[11:50:28] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: grunt-contrib-jshint master uses jshint 1.1.0 ...
[11:50:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, we need to wait for the friendly folks at grunt-contrib-jshint to make a release before we can take advantage of that.
[11:51:19] <gseguin> or we can pull it from github
[11:51:41] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ^
[11:52:08] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I don't want any hacks just for this one line.
[11:52:13] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll rephrase it ...
[11:52:18] <gseguin> it's cool
[11:52:37] <gseguin> just a package.json change
[11:52:38] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK ... can you instruct npm to pull from GH via package.json?
[11:52:51] <gseguin> indeed
[11:53:19] <_|Nix|_> Well, I'll be darned ...
[11:53:43] <_|Nix|_> Sure! I'll take one grunt-contrib-jshint@master, please, thank you! :)
[11:53:47] <gseguin> and from a specific reference too I believe
[11:54:14] * _|Nix|_ goes googling about adding GH references to package.json ...
[11:55:02] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think I got it ...
[11:55:11] <gseguin> ok cool
[11:55:17] <gseguin> yeah just do that
[11:56:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Ummm ... I tried "grunt-contrib-jshint": "https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jshint.git#master" and it failed ...
[11:57:02] <gseguin> use the git:// url
[11:57:08] <_|Nix|_> OK. That's probably it.
[12:02:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Now, the linter has found a bunch of trailing whitespace ... good ... I'll fix it.
[12:12:11] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Looking good now ...
[12:13:17] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: oh goodie!
[12:13:37] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am here now
[12:14:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, but we should probably switch back to a released version at some point ...
[12:15:09] <gseguin> oh yeah absolutely
[12:15:30] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I actually only recently switched back to official releases
[12:15:48] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: for the grunt migration it was all git://

[12:54:05] <gseguin> toddmparker: Builder should be fixed now
[12:54:29] <gseguin> meaning, working with 1.3.1 
[12:54:56] <gseguin> and as I say that it just crashed
[12:55:07] <gseguin> :'(
[13:04:00] <toddmparker> yikes
[13:05:02] <gseguin> I think I know why it crashed
[13:05:46] <gseguin> still the same bug but since it is on the web page itself, if the user doesn't refresh it's going to crash the server
[13:07:08] <gseguin> And I have no way of catching that exception
[13:08:03] <gseguin> actually jrburke, that would be a question for you, still there?
[13:09:42] <arschmitz> agcolom: there was a request for it from people because our swipe event is broken on ios 
[13:09:43] <jrburke> hi gseguin, what question? how to catch exceptions from an requirejs.optimize call?
[13:09:52] <gseguin> yes
[13:10:12] <gseguin> how come the errback is not called?
[13:10:31] <jrburke> requirejs.optimize(args, callback, errback). using the most recent r.js helps, i think i fixed a bug or two with that more recently
[13:10:50] <jrburke> gseguin: what triggers the exception?
[13:10:59] <gseguin> ENOENT
[13:11:00] <arschmitz> agcolom: so the event was re-written to be able to be extended to allow for the event to be fixed on ios. We decided to not fix in the library because it has to big of a perfromance impact
[13:11:32] <gseguin> jrburke: in my dependencies there is a reference to a "depend" module 
[13:11:44] <gseguin> but it's not in the baseUrl directory
[13:11:53] <gseguin> and there is not path set for it
[13:12:23] <jrburke> gseguin: what version of r.js? just for kicks you could try a try/catch around the optimize call, but probably will not work 
[13:13:02] <gseguin> the package.json says latest but I haven't npm installed in a while
[13:13:08] <gseguin> jrburke: http://pastebin.com/7V1U4cSg
[13:13:20] <gseguin> it is wrapped with a try/catch
[13:13:25] <jrburke> gseguin: typing node r.js -v will give version
[13:14:03] <gseguin> jrburke: 2.1.5
[13:14:48] <jrburke> gseguin: do you have logLevel set to a particular value?
[13:15:00] <jrburke> in args passed to optimize
[13:18:21] <gseguin> jrburke: 0
[13:18:26] <jrburke> gseguin: you can confirm that the quit here is not the cause by logging/breakpointing there: https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/2.1.5/dist/r.js#L23399
[13:19:21] <jrburke> oh, that could be it. try logLevel: 4 (silent)
[13:19:40] * gseguin tries that
[13:20:58] <gseguin> jrburke: bingo
[13:21:11] <gseguin> but that doesn't make sense though
[13:21:27] <_|Nix|_> WTF?! One of the builds has errored out during npm install ...
[13:21:46] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: that happens, rarely but that happens
[13:21:46] <_|Nix|_> What is "esprima" and "ariya"?
[13:21:46] <jrburke> ok yeah, so i guess that is a bit awkward. the assumption was that for programmatic use, logging would be set to silent (it is by default when requirejs.optimize() is called instead of command line args
[13:22:05] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: esprima is a javascript parser written in javascript
[13:22:13] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ariya is the author
[13:22:16] <jrburke> gseguin: but it may be that folks want to have more verbose logging even in programmatic use.
[13:22:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Cool!

[13:23:00] <jrburke> gseguin: and i should probably just throw and if no handler up above, then let it bubble out with a non-zero status code.
[13:23:01] <frequent> agcolom: ping.
[13:23:28] <gseguin> jrburke: That's what I was expecting
[13:23:41] <gseguin> I was hoping to get some verbose logging 
[13:23:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: K, so I re-ran it and it's doing better now O_o
[13:23:47] <gseguin> hence the question this morning
[13:25:28] <frequent>  if booking works tomorrow morning, I will be in oxford 8:15 Friday. 
[13:25:36] <frequent> and out.
[13:26:06] <jrburke> gseguin: yeah, will look into it for next point release: https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/issues/430
[13:26:32] <gseguin> thanks very much jrburke, in the meantime I'll turn off logging
[13:27:42] <agcolom> frequent, ok, great. 
[13:30:11] <agcolom> arschmitz: ok, Thanks for the clarification.
