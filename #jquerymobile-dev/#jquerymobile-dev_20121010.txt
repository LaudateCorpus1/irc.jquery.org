[07:10:26] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Ping!
[07:10:40] <gseguin> yo _|Nix|_
[07:10:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Hey!
[07:10:51] <gseguin> 'sup?
[07:11:15] <_|Nix|_> In js/transitions/flip.js, should it read //>>css.structure: ../../css/structure/jquery.mobile.transition.flip.css ?
[07:11:30] <_|Nix|_> Currently there's only one ../ in there.
[07:11:45] <_|Nix|_> So, it actually points to js/css/structure/... but that path DNE.
[07:12:35] * gseguin looks
[07:12:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/transitions/flip.js#L9
[07:14:26] <gseguin> I think it's relative to baseUrl and baseUrl is js/
[07:14:53] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Aha, OK. Understood.
[07:15:15] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Where is the value for baseUrl stored?
[07:15:42] * gseguin searches
[07:16:44] <gseguin> build/bin/js.sh
[07:16:56] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I just found it myself. Thanks!
[07:16:59] <Wilto> We’re partying in Boston, just for the record.
[07:17:13] <_|Nix|_> Nice!
[07:17:14] <Wilto> It’s like Spring Break with all of Filament in town. But cold. And damp. And we’re working.
[07:17:24] <gseguin> getting in shape for next week, Wilto ?
[07:18:28] <Wilto> As “in shape” as I ever am, gseguin.
[07:18:46] <gseguin> heh :)
[07:19:01] <ryanneufeld> round is a shape
[07:19:19] <ryanneufeld> (trust me I know)
[07:29:50] <Wilto> I’m gettin’ there.
[07:40:18] <Wilto> So, I’m gonna patch anywhere we’re using $.browser so that it does not use $.browser. For reasons.
[07:40:24] <Wilto> All opposed?
[07:42:36] <gseguin> Wilto: it's actually used only in the hashchange plugin from @cowboy
[07:43:07] <Wilto> Ah, yeah. One more in the tests, but eh.
[07:43:30] <gseguin> Good point, I didn't grep the test code
[07:43:43] <Wilto> Oh, I grepped it. I grepped all of the codes. The whole thing.
[07:43:59] <Wilto> grep is when you press command + shift + f in sublime text 2 right
[07:44:25] <gseguin> right, I have a different shorcut:
[07:44:34] <gseguin> 1. open a terminal
[07:44:40] <Wilto> termiwhat
[07:44:43] <gseguin> 2. cd jquery-mobile
[07:44:43] <Wilto> like for busses and trains
[07:44:45] <Wilto> weird
[07:44:49] <gseguin> 3. ... you know...
[07:44:51] <gseguin> :D
[07:44:53] <Wilto> you have it on a cd like aol
[07:46:55] <gseguin> so for the hashchange plugin, that block of code wrapped in a comment: "remove if you don't support IE6/7/8", tempting isn't it?
[07:47:02] <Wilto> I was *just* thinking that.
[07:48:27] <gseguin> we could provide this part of  the code as a separate file for the few users that want to support it
[07:49:04] <Wilto> Hmm.
[07:49:08] <Wilto> Aaaactually…
[07:49:19] <Wilto> $.browser.msie && !supports_onhashchange && (function() { …
[07:49:47] <Wilto> So without $.browser.msie that never takes place. Thus, including the jQuery old-IE-support plugin makes it work.
[07:49:54] <Wilto> We might not actually have to do anything here?
[07:50:47] <DaveMethvin> "ERROR: $.browser is null or not an object"
[07:52:28] <gseguin> Wilto: your javascript engine now has a name! It's called DaveMethvin
[07:52:49] <DaveMethvin> i love to spew error messages
[07:52:52] <Wilto> Oh, well, we wouldn’t do _nothing_.
[07:53:00] <DaveMethvin> how about this: if ( window.attachEvent && !window.addEventListener) { thar be oldIE }
[07:53:25] <gseguin> ?CC
[07:53:26] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[07:53:32] <Wilto> I’d rather do the conditional-inject-y thing.
[07:53:55] <gseguin> works for me
[07:54:06] <gseguin> still need that if though
[07:54:12] <DaveMethvin> as long as you don't use $.browser i'm happy
[07:54:16] <gseguin> split it in two files
[07:54:17] <Wilto> But, I mean, this is also floating around in Ben Manlyman’s lib; maybe we just see what he does and update?
[07:54:37] <DaveMethvin> what if he does it rong too? naah
[07:55:09] <Wilto> Not Ben Almond.
[07:55:28] <Wilto> If he does it wrong, surely it is a Ben Aluminum impostor.
[07:55:39] <gseguin> either way... but I think that's an easy way to get rid of code for most of our users
[07:56:15] <gseguin> and then the few who are still needing oldIE support have to build a custom build to do so
[07:56:19] <Wilto> I keep saying we should just remove all our semicolons if we’re worried about code weight!
[07:56:24] <Wilto> NOBODY LISTENS TO ME.
[07:56:29] <DaveMethvin> not even your dog?
[07:56:50] <gseguin> he does but he can't type
[07:57:07] <DaveMethvin> speaking of which, i have to walk my dog before he has an unfortunate accident
[07:58:05] <Wilto> He does not listen to me, no.
[08:28:24] <johnbender> Annnnnd we're back
[08:29:57] <Wilto> Hey johnbender.
[08:36:25] <johnbender> Wilto: yo
[08:39:16] <gseguin> hey Bender! Welcome back
[08:39:59] <gseguin> Still in Europe?
[08:41:07] <Wilto> Wat’chu think on the $.browser stuff, johnbender?
[08:44:26] <gseguin> I think he may not have fully recovered from the jsconf.eu parties ;)
[08:44:49] <Wilto> Tsk tsk. For shame, Bender.
[08:45:09] <Wilto> If there is one thing I cannot condone, it is drinking to excess!
[09:24:05] <johnbender> gseguin: I didn't go to any of them :P
[09:24:13] <johnbender> I'm not much for parties where I don't know anyone
[10:26:36] <_|Nix|_> Heeeey! The channel's alive with the sound^H^H^H^H^Htext of jqm.
[11:13:34] <mspisars> what happened to bot-t?
[12:02:00] <johnbender> Wilto: should be a quick fix - to answer your question from hours ago
[12:25:01] <arschmitz> ASchmitz@billdodgetycodog7
[12:30:41] <arschmitz> sorry rogue macro!
[12:50:24] <agcolom> johnbender: Hi! Are we cherry-picking into 1.2-stable?
[12:51:04] <agcolom> gseguin: Hi, maybe you know this ^ ?
[12:51:32] <gseguin> yes though I don't know if the branch has been created
[12:51:36] <gseguin> lemme check
[12:51:57] <agcolom> I saw someone do it so i did and it worked...
[12:52:08] <agcolom> but then I thought i'd better check...
[12:54:04] <gseguin> yup
[12:54:15] <agcolom> ok, thanks!
[12:54:27] <gseguin> so yeah bug fixes go to 1.2-stable and probably 1.1-stable
[12:54:47] <gseguin> until we release 1.1.2 and stop maintaining that branch
[12:54:54] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ^ ?
[12:55:17] <agcolom> this one is about popup doc so 1.2 and 1.2-stable I guess...
[12:55:31] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: ping
[12:55:35] <gseguin> yeah unless not applicable to 1.1-stable
[12:56:02] <agcolom> so master will lead to 1.3?
[12:56:11] <gseguin> indeed
[12:56:24] <agcolom> Ah, ok.... I get it :)
[13:07:56] <agcolom> I have one final meeting to get a reference for alex's school tomorrow (from 5pm to 7pm), so I may be late for the meeting...
