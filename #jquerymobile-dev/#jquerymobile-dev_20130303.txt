[02:33:55] <agcolom> Hi everyone, I have managed to charge the Firefox OS dev phone. I've started to test using the demo center. Looking good so far :-)
[03:33:38] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Old build #191: STILL UNSTABLE in 1 hr 1 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/191/
[08:25:13] <gseguin> awesome agcolom 
[08:33:58] <gnarf> gseguin: cron
[08:34:35] <gnarf> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/node-web-view-proxy/
[08:46:13] <gnarf> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/node-web-git-proxy/
[08:46:15] <gnarf> sry
[10:32:00] <gseguin> gnarf: I had to update the grunt--0.4 branch manually
[10:32:31] <gseguin> gnarf: that's why I wondered
[10:34:11] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ping
[11:32:38] <gnarf> gseguin: cd /var/www/view.jquerymobile.com/ ; grunt
[11:33:32] <gnarf> Skipping grunt-0.4 @ d5aaae5abc3202394c1aeb8d86fee24600630cec
[11:33:47] <gnarf> also check out cron.sh in that folder
[11:33:49] <gnarf> er sory
[11:33:57] <gnarf> cron.out - it has the log from the last cron run
[11:34:24] <gnarf> and public_html/grunt-0.4/build.out.txt should have the output of the last build script
[11:41:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll be on inprobably an hour or so (after my daughter goes to bed)
[12:07:38] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: gseguin uGoMobi toddmparker arschmitz if I want to do some proper tests on the FFOS dev phone, is the demo site ok, or are there other things to test?
[12:12:03] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The demo site is probably a good start.
[12:12:43] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: great, thanks :-)
[12:13:54] <agcolom> Took me 3 days to manage to charge it! (Chris didn't have a spare charger... All look standard, but the micro USB from BB would not work. The one from Samsung did ;-) Luckily my house is full of these gadgets!

[12:25:32] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Pong!
[12:41:34] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: you wrote the sequence tests right?
[12:43:23] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: something changed in requirejs causing some of the sequence tests to fail with the latest RequireJS
[12:43:55] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: could you take a look at the grunt-0.4 branch?
[12:44:07] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: `grunt test suites=navigation`
[12:44:30] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: sorry: `grunt test --suites=navigation`
[12:47:40] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK.
[12:48:29] <gseguin> you'll see if you just drop in the requirejs version from master that suite will pass
[12:49:00] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ^
[12:56:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'm assuming you're using requirejs 2.1.4 (latest) on grunt-0.4, right?
[12:56:29] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: nope haven't upgraded to that one
[12:56:57] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: 2.1.2
[12:57:17] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK. That's fine.
[12:57:31] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: but I've tried with 2.1.4 and the same issue happens
[13:00:03] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK. I'll get on it as soon as I finish one email.
[13:01:33] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: for building though we use whatever version grunt-contrib-requirejs relies on
[13:02:36] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: which is 2.1.4
[13:03:04] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I can only imagine that it's a dependency problem, because async loading should work on /all/ versions of requirejs, unless requirejs itself has a bug.
[13:03:36] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: but we do some funky business with all these redirections
[13:18:15] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: let me know your findings
[13:56:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Checking it out now ...
[13:56:42] <gseguin> it's really weird
[13:57:02] <gseguin> I'm looking at test number #1 in sequence_core
[13:57:32] <gseguin> I'm stopped in changePage right before the call to transitionPages
[13:57:39] <gseguin> and activePage is the right one
[13:59:52] <gseguin> yet when I reach line 52 of sequence_core activePage is "#basicPageTest"
[13:59:58] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ^
[14:01:31] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'm not there yet. How do I run grunt 0.4 if my globally installed version is < 0.4?
[14:01:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I tried to npm install grunt and it seems to have installed 0.4 locally, but I don't see the top-level script anywhere.
[14:02:15] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: What is it ? It used to be node_modules/.bin/grunt
[14:02:45] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I have node_modules/grunt/ but I dunno where the actual top-level script is.
[14:05:58] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: `grunt --version`
[14:07:02] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: the new grunt installs grunt-cli globally
[14:07:37] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: and then it picks up the actual grunt exec from your local project
[14:08:02] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: the one that was installed by `npm install`
[14:08:53] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I got to drop off very soon
[14:09:26] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: The one thing that I see happening in that test
[14:10:31] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: is that after changing page to "#basicDialog" something is calling changePage "#basicTestPage"
[14:10:41] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: so it could be a timing issue
[14:12:56] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[19:20:44] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: any luck?
[21:05:49] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I think I fixed the sequence tests by testHelper.setPushState re-setup the special event navigate after disabling pushstate
