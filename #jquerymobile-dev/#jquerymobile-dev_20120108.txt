[17:14:49] <gseguin> Man! IRCCloud's been acting up the whole weekend
[17:15:17] <gseguin> jrburke: you're here?
[17:15:31] <jrburke> hi gseguin
[17:15:35] <gseguin> hey
[17:15:40] <gseguin> good weekend?
[17:16:55] <gseguin> so I got the filter thing working: http://amd-builder.no.de/jqm-jrburke/issue_3386-2/make?baseUrl=js&include=jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup&filter=../build/wrapDefine.js
[17:17:20] <jrburke> yeah good weekend, hope yours is too.
[17:17:25] <jrburke> sweet! (on the filter)
[17:17:54] <gseguin> yeah went to the beach with my family, the weather was extraordinary
[17:18:26] <jrburke> oh nice. been rainy up here, but the nice kind, mostly misty.
[17:19:13] <gseguin> I realized though that my routes aren't going to work with projects like dojo where there are several namespaces
[17:20:32] <jrburke> gseguin: yeah i need to look more at dojo loading in general. but i think that is a fine "version 2" thing to consider.
[17:20:51] <gseguin> were you saying that a web builder was something dojo was looking for?
[17:21:34] <gseguin> are you the owner for that?
[17:21:52] <jrburke> but i can see if it is nice to be able to use other repos that are being tracked by your builder. ah yes, but someone at ibm has stepped up and they have a web builder working now. but i'm sure it would be great to be able to use dojo/dijit/dojox code in another builder
[17:22:16] <jrburke> i used to be the owner on the dojo build stuff, but rawld gill is now -- he has done the AMD work for dojo
[17:22:35] <gseguin> oh ok
[17:23:00] <jrburke> but in general, i think i need to look at fixing some things with using dojo code with r.js, so until i get that sorted out, you'll likely have trouble supporting it in your builder
[17:23:09] <jrburke> i have it on my list for this week to look at the dojo code though
[17:23:38] <gseguin> yeah I saw the tweets with @ryanflorence
[17:24:00] <gseguin> I did try it out of curiosity and there is indeed a problem (didn
[17:24:05] <gseguin> 't investigate though
[17:24:52] <jrburke> for the web builder, maybe being able to specify paths/packages config, and just having a convention on the file layout so that it works out, that might be enough to get it to work
[17:25:32] <jrburke> IOW, as long as it works as an r.js config value, and all the projects are siblings in a particular directory, maybe it works out
[17:26:01] <gseguin> yeah I was exploring a config file and different routes
[17:27:02] <gseguin> having something like /:project/:repo?/:ref/make
[17:27:15] <gseguin> where repo is optional
[17:29:53] <jrburke> ah, so if you have that structure, then in that make call, could have a paths.dojo=/dojo/dojo/1.3.2 where the make endpoint would convert the /dojo part to be the path where dojo is on disk for the builder?
[17:30:02] <jrburke> well just talking out loud.
[17:30:15] <jrburke> thinking out loud
[17:31:34] <jrburke> ah, so was the useLib thing useful, are you using that? If so, then i'll probably merge that branch into master.
[17:31:37] <gseguin> or rather on disk it would be /workspaces/dojo/1.7.1/dojo
[17:31:50] <jrburke> right
[17:41:30] <gseguin> I have to drop off, I'll be back online later
