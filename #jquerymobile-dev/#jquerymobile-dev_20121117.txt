[04:33:16] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender The question was this: Should we systematically implement _destroy() for all our widgets, whether we get bug reports about their being absent or not?
[04:33:21] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.

[13:39:34] <arschmitz> Hi _|Nix|_
[13:46:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[13:47:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you think? Should we push the fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3886 (option to not create close button on dialog) to 1.2.1?
[13:47:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've already closed two pull requests attempting to customize the close button.
[13:47:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If this is wanted so badly, maybe we should cherry-pick to 1.2 stable.
[13:48:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... after all, it's not such a big change.
[13:48:46] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Hmmm it technically is a new feature but it's also pretty minor
[13:48:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ...
[13:49:14] <arschmitz> And i can't see any potential to break anything with it
[13:49:26] <_|Nix|_> I know, eh?
[13:49:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:  that's a tough one
[13:50:07] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... I guess we should talk about it on Monday ...
[13:50:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I also ran across an old PR of mine: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4795
[13:50:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It no longer applies cleanly, so I'm going to update it.
[13:51:05] <arschmitz> Probably because by the strict rule it's new so 1.3 but I can see your argument for 1.2.1
[13:51:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Once I'm done, you should probably have a look at it, since you've been working with fixedToolbar a lot lately.
[13:52:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's about using ._on() inside fixedToolbar inside _bindPageEvents ...
[13:52:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Sure no problem
[13:52:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Since fixedToolbar has _destroy() it makes a ton of sense to use _on() when binding to this.element.closest( ".ui-page" ), since, otherwise, those bindings will outlive the widget.
[13:53:48] <arschmitz> Kinda goes with my issue about reviewing plugin page bindings and switching to _on too
[13:54:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Absolutely. I completely forgot about that PR, and now it no longer applies cleanly :(
[13:54:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but I did also notice some sloppy code in there, so it's good that I'm recreating it by hand.
[13:54:41] <arschmitz> And johnbender when I wrote my extension was specific we should be using on now too
[13:54:55] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, absolutely.
[13:55:29] <_|Nix|_> Though I think we also need to chain up inside _destroy() for it to work.
[13:55:57] <_|Nix|_> So, it's not enough to use ._on(), you must also this._super() inside _destroy().
[13:56:45] <arschmitz> No destroy destroyed everything using _on and then calls _destroy internally
[13:57:45] <arschmitz> Avoiding the need to call this._super
[13:57:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, great!
[13:58:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:  no it's _super ha ha ha
[13:58:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Still good to call that though, in case we ever end up doing any _destroy()-ing inside $.mobile.widget
[13:58:49] <_|Nix|_> :_
[13:58:51] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:59:43] <arschmitz> Yeah if we ever add a _destroy inside $.mobile.widget it would get overwritten otherwise
[14:00:21] <_|Nix|_> *nod* ...
[14:03:19] <arschmitz> Adding _destroy is going to be a pain but I really think we need to
[14:09:40] <_|Nix|_> Amen.
[14:19:21] <arschmitz> Especially since we auto initialize our widgets allowing them to be destroyed seems even more important
[14:21:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sometimes I think that we've taken too much of a document-centric approach ... like, render the page, make it look good, and then go home - job's done.
[14:21:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... leaving precious few means by which to affect the page once rendered.
[14:22:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... as evidenced by the lack of on-the-fly options and _destroy() methods.
[14:22:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Yeah I agree 100%
[14:23:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Creating truly native-like applications from this state will be herculean.
[14:23:33] <arschmitz> We are kinda ignoring the jquery motto of being a good neighbor with our widgets
[14:23:58] <arschmitz> And cleaning up after ourselves
[14:24:05] <_|Nix|_> Definitely.
[14:24:53] <arschmitz> I also noticed a few non extension extensions like list view filter
[14:25:41] <arschmitz> That's kinda a mess right now which causes nested filtered views to bubble and have two filter boxes
[14:25:55] <_|Nix|_> Alright, I'm going to retire for the evening ...
[14:26:01] <_|Nix|_> Have a good one!
[14:26:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Ok take it easy
[15:58:12] <Krinkle> _|Nix|_: So, stuff is running.
[15:58:37] <Krinkle> What of http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerymobile ?
[16:00:04] <Krinkle> btw, have you considered using a git submodule for qunit?
[16:00:31] <Krinkle> looks like the current copy is 4+ months old
