[00:23:49] <uGoMobi_Jasper> good morning europe
[00:47:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: Morning? It's almost lunchtime in Finland :)
[00:48:30] <uGoMobi_Jasper> I guess you have a kid that wakes you up at 6am ;-)
[00:49:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: 08:40 today, but yesterday it was 07:25 :)
[00:50:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: Astute observation, though :)
[01:58:37] <uGoMobi_Jasper> _|Nix|_: you are working on the new popup widget, right?
[02:31:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: Correct.
[02:31:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: Sorry - was lunching ...
[02:31:34] <uGoMobi_Jasper> _|Nix|_: of course, dinner at 4pm? :)
[02:32:27] <_|Nix|_> Not really ... don't even know /if/ I'm gonna have dinner - my daughter's going through the phase where, if she's eating and she sees you eating something else, she doesn't want her own food anymore, but yours.
[02:32:31] <uGoMobi_Jasper> _|Nix|_: the new widget is going to be used for custom select menu?
[02:32:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: That's the plan, I guess ...
[02:33:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: I basically developed popup by starting out with the select menu, so it makes sense to go full circle ...
[02:34:24] <uGoMobi_Jasper> _|Nix|_: i just saw an issue i opened about custom select menu accessibility

[02:35:27] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4039 on jquery-mobile (uGoMobi; 3w, 2d ago): Custom select menu accessibility
[02:35:48] <uGoMobi_Jasper> maybe already covered, but just in case
[02:36:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: Good issue - the keyboard interface should work inside a popup.
[02:38:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: OK - I see it.
[02:38:32] <uGoMobi_Jasper> if applicable I will look for the new popup widget issue and refer to this one there
[02:39:13] <_|Nix|_> "the new popup widget issue"? What do you mean?
[02:40:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: Might be a listview issue - the listview may not be grabbing the focus if it's a multiselect.
[02:41:14] <uGoMobi_Jasper> ah ok
[02:42:19] <uGoMobi_Jasper> new popup widget issue... i thought the idea of the new widget started with adding 'issue' to tracker
[02:42:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: Yeah, Todd did add an issue, but only after I had submitted a PR.
[02:43:19] <uGoMobi_Jasper> how about closing popup with escape key?
[02:44:43] <uGoMobi_Jasper> i will have another look at listview for multiselect
[02:46:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: I implemented that ( closing popup with Esc ).

[07:41:12] <uGoMobi_Jasper> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[07:41:47] <uGoMobi_Jasper> just check if its right one because there are/were two branches
[07:44:18] <deAtog> thanks.. yeah that branch looks like the one currently under development
[07:44:34] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog:yeah it does
[07:46:03] <deAtog> I think i might start using it though it's not released yet.. nice to have an easy method to present the user with informational messages
[07:46:50] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: yeah it looks great
[08:07:17] <deAtog> looks like line 55 of jquery.mobile.popup.js has a trailing comma that needs to be removed
[09:22:01] <deAtog> uGoMobi_Jasper: any experience with using the popup-widget to create a dynamic popup? IE creating the container div using document.createElement?
[09:22:26] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: no, sorry
[09:22:36] <uGoMobi_Jasper> didn't play with it at all yet
[09:23:25] <deAtog> ok, just thought I'd ask.. I'm trying to make that work atm.. and it's not going so well atm..
[09:25:27] <uGoMobi_Jasper> I see, well you can always ask :)
[09:33:51] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: why you want to create the container? isnt that exactly what the widget does?
[09:38:18] <Wilto> Hey, trailing commas are MY job.
[09:39:47] <uGoMobi_Jasper> Wilto: nice job :)

[10:52:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] object precedence tests - John Bender
[10:53:22] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: my latest set of commits is deprecating the loading msg config stuff
[10:53:31] <johnbender> and pushing it under a single config object
[10:53:44] <johnbender> at some point it would be good to move that loading message code to a widget
[11:03:52] <deAtog> uGoMobi_Jasper: the examples show: $(selector).popup() to turn an existing DOM element into a popup. I don't have an existing DOM object so I want to create one with the content I want displayed.
[11:09:39] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: ok i get it
[11:17:50] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: initSelecter is element with data-role="popup" which is the div with the content you want to display as popup
[11:18:45] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: when that div is not there yet on pageinit, can you manually init the widget?
[11:19:16] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: after you created the div
[11:21:11] <deAtog> uGoMobi_Jasper: according to that documentation, you should be able to turn any DOM element into a popup by calling .popup on it.. at that point it shouldn't need the data-role="popup" attribute
[11:23:09] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: yes thats what i meant... sorry, you already said $(div).popup() not working... missed that part
[11:24:48] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: maybe to soon to try to use it, since it's still in development
[11:24:58] <deAtog> yeah.. looks that way..
[11:27:31] <uGoMobi_Jasper> deAtog: what about empty div with data-role popup in your markup and then inject content later? or is that not an option?
[11:33:20] <deAtog> uGoMobi_Jasper: that may work.. but it's hard to say with the loading of different pages
[11:38:43] <agcolom> Hi :-) anyone here? I have a really strange issue I'd like someone else to confirm...
[11:40:25] <Wilto> I am constantly in the business of strange issues, agcolom. Whassup?
[11:40:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_Jasper: deAtog: $(selector).popup() is not working?
[11:41:12] <agcolom> Hi Wilto :-) look at this: http://api.batura.mobi/CangasiPhone/services/inServices.html
[11:41:30] <agcolom> now look at it with FF and also Safari and Chrome
[11:41:37] <deAtog> _|Nix|_: I'm trying to use .popup with a div created from calling document.createElement('div')
[11:41:42] <agcolom> What color is the header ??
[11:41:54] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: Is the div attached to the dom when you call popup?
[11:43:12] <deAtog> _|Nix|_: I've tried that.. as well as leaving it un-attached.. both seem to produce similar results.. the popup is created and sytled but ends up in the wrong spot
[11:44:34] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: What do you mean "ends up in the wrong spot"? Where does it end up?
[11:44:39] <Wilto> agcolom: Black in Firefox, gradient in WebKit. I’m guessing that’s just them not having the correct gradient syntax in place.
[11:45:33] <agcolom> ha! yet! That's someone doing the gradient by hand and missing some (sorry forgot the word)
[11:45:52] <deAtog> _|Nix|_: If I attach the div to the content section of the page it ends up being displayed at the bottom of the active page.
[11:45:54] <agcolom> sorry, I meant ha! yes
[11:46:07] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: You're missing the popup css.
[11:46:37] <deAtog> oh... that's probably it..
[11:46:44] <agcolom> Thought I was going mad! thanks :-)
[11:46:57] <Wilto> agcolom: Yeah, looks like… I’d mention that might be the issue, and suggest reopening the issue with a reduced test case if that doesn’t turn out to be it.
[11:48:34] <agcolom> This is someone's case for a different issue actually, but I am struggling to understand it (the English is not clear so I am going to ask for clarification https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4276)
[11:48:34] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4276 on jquery-mobile (batura-endika; 5d, 9h ago): content jump with navbar in header fixed
[11:49:32] <deAtog> _|Nix|_: yup that was it
[11:49:33] <agcolom> then when I tried it with different browsers, I realised there was a problem with the gradient, and thought it was either my crazy day at work or something in my glass of wine ;-)
[11:49:46] <Wilto> agcolom: Oof, yeah, I dunno exactly what they’re getting at there.
[11:50:05] <Wilto> Oh.
[11:50:28] <toddparker> I think this is the page padding
[11:50:29] <Wilto> I think they’re saying that it takes a moment for the page to respond to a taller fixed header, and pad the top of the page accordingly.
[11:50:32] <_|Nix|_> deAtog: Awesome!
[11:50:34] <Wilto> Yep.
[11:50:45] <toddparker> if you look at the demo, the collapsibles are partially obscured under the header
[11:51:10] <Wilto> Huh. Okay in Chrome for me.
[11:51:13] <toddparker> code looks ok tho
[11:51:22] <toddparker> seeing this in chrome
[11:51:55] <agcolom> yes, the collapsible is partly hidden but if you open and close it's fine
[11:52:15] <Wilto> Think we got it.
[11:52:15] <toddparker> looks like we're not re-caluating that correctly when pages ar eloped in
[11:52:19] <agcolom> only seems to happen in Chrome
[11:52:46] <toddparker> hmm
[11:52:47] <toddparker> odd
[11:53:21] <agcolom> ah no, happens in safari also, change the tab at the top
[11:53:31] <agcolom> and in FF
[11:54:03] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Ping! Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4283 ... I've looked and there really is a bug in FF 12 on Windoze ... the text of the popup is such that it is wider than the browser window. Sometimes the browser wraps the text and sometimes it gets clipped by the left or right edge of the window.
[11:54:03] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4283 on jquery-mobile (adammessinger; 4d, 23h ago): Popup widget: trigger link positioned > ~865px left causes mis-positioning of popup
[11:55:09] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The question is: Do we want to add max-width: 90%; to the css, as adammessinger suggests in another issue, or do we want to leave sizing decisions up to the user of popup.
[11:57:21] <agcolom> any window resize puts the padding correctly
[11:57:42] <Wilto> So maybe it’s just a timing issue with the recalculation after changing pages.
[11:59:57] <johnbender> toddparker: agcolom
[12:00:06] <johnbender> do we have a "deprecated" visual cue for the docs
[12:00:06] <johnbender> ?
[12:00:25] <agcolom> yellow box?
[12:00:35] <johnbender> could
[12:01:26] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: Ah yeah, the popup won’t be constrained by the width of the page, right?
[12:01:41] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: I’d slap a max-width: 100% on there, at least.
[12:02:08] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Aye, sir!
[12:02:25] <agcolom> johnbender: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/api/data-attributes.html there's a tiny example there

[12:12:03] <toddparker> right
[12:12:14] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: the vertical positioning seems off
[12:12:19] <toddparker> go here: http://jsbin.com/ohufuv/16
[12:12:32] <toddparker> make you window small, scroll down and hit the photo button
[12:12:49] <toddparker> it opens the photo way offscreen towards the top of the page
[12:13:37] <toddparker> you'll also see how the photo isn't centered horizontally
[12:13:55] <toddparker> it has more left margin than right and the "x" button runs off the screen
[12:14:06] <toddparker> this is using the branch preview css and js
[12:14:10] <toddparker> maybe it hasn't updated
[12:15:01] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah ... it'd be interesting to see if the max-width influences this ...
[12:15:25] <agcolom> on that example, I see the photo centered horizontally in FF but not vertically
[12:15:47] <agcolom> and the x is well positioned for me??!!
[12:16:01] <agcolom> Shall i send a screenshot?
[12:16:56] <agcolom> toddparker, you mean centered on the page or on the popup?

[12:20:23] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: There's also a navigation problem when pushstate is off ... I haven't really explored no-pushstate-mode, but deAtog has brought it to my attention.
[12:20:44] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'll have to figure that one out, I think ...
[12:21:05] <toddparker> the horizontal alignment seems off consistently on my safari and chrome
[12:21:29] <agcolom> your ref to not being centered horizontally is for the popup window ?
[12:21:41] <agcolom> or the image relative to the popup?
[12:22:16] <toddparker> pulling the latest..maybe the branch preview is behind
[12:22:30] <johnbender> it takes an hour to update
[12:22:34] <toddparker> ah
[12:22:47] <toddparker> i'm going to paste in these examples into the docs page
[12:22:49] <agcolom> if it is the popup, it is I think because it gets positioned according to it's launcher button, see http://jsbin.com/ohufuv/22/ and try the second photo button

[12:23:15] <johnbender> kinblas: gseguin: anyone opposed to moving the whole page loading mechanism into it's own widget
[12:23:26] <johnbender> it'll be backward compat
[12:23:49] <toddparker> I think that if a popup is larger than say 60-70% of the width of the window, it should just be centered
[12:23:56] <toddparker> regardless of what you clicked to open it

[12:24:55] <toddparker> what do people think about that?
[12:25:18] <toddparker> one a popup dominates the screen, it seems like it should horiz center in the window
[12:25:37] <agcolom> uGoMobi_Jasper: not me, but possibly wilto and toddparker??
[12:25:45] <uGoMobi_Jasper> I see an issue there that has been reported before. When you inspect the code ui-content comes before ui-header
[12:25:53] <agcolom> toddparker: yes, I agree
[12:26:00] <Wilto> WHO SUMMONS ME HENCE
[12:26:03] <agcolom> should be centered
[12:26:16] <toddparker> cool agcolom
[12:26:32] <toddparker> what is up with that content re-ordering?
[12:26:42] <agcolom> I know it's really weird!

[12:26:58] <toddparker> ok, thanks
[12:27:52] <Wilto> toddparker: Yeah, I dig that idea.
[12:28:15] <agcolom> On the popup, is it possible to "force" rounded corners on the photo? (sorry for being picky)
[12:28:18] <Wilto> I wonder how hard it would be to get some real basic collision detection in there.
[12:28:43] <Wilto> agcolom: Images are generally weird about border-radius—might be something like that in play.
[12:30:53] <agcolom> or can we make the rounded corner square if it is a photo with square corners?
[12:31:21] <Wilto> Eh, I’m cool with leaving that stuff to the user.

[12:42:19] <agcolom> toddparker: I've played with firebug and maybe we could just add an option to not have the rounded corners that would remove or override the ui-corner-all
[12:42:23] <toddparker> sorry no corners.
[12:42:36] <toddparker> there is an option already
[12:42:44] <toddparker> i just added that - BOOM
[12:42:51] <agcolom> perfect :-)
[12:43:00] <toddparker> dunno why there is that bit of extra space at the bottom of the photo
[12:43:10] <agcolom> yes, I get it as well
[12:43:11] <toddparker> thought it was whitespace in the code, but no
[12:44:22] <agcolom> oh, I have an issue, the photo popup got pushed up and I can't close it
[12:45:11] <agcolom> we need to check the x is always visible
[12:45:18] <toddparker> that was the vertical positioning i mentioned ot _
[12:45:19] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: could white space be because of display inline-block?
[12:45:22] <toddparker> to _|Nix|_
[12:45:29] <toddparker> maybe uGoMobi_Jasper
[12:46:22] <toddparker> ont hé frapper? i just changed it to block, no difference
[12:46:51] <agcolom> top value must always be >=0
[12:47:06] <agcolom> can currently be negatie
[12:47:09] <agcolom> negative
[12:47:21] <toddparker> good catch
[12:47:34] <toddparker> it seems like this doesn't take in account scroll position
[12:47:51] <toddparker> that photo appears at the top of the page when scrolled down
[12:47:59] <toddparker> _|Nix|_:  you see that?
[12:48:21] <toddparker> we also need to figure out padding defaults
[12:48:24] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: float left and white space is gone
[12:48:35] <toddparker> uGoMobi_Jasper: interesting
[12:48:48] <toddparker> float the popup container?
[12:48:58] <uGoMobi_Jasper> no the img element
[12:49:14] <uGoMobi_Jasper> probably new line in the markup
[12:49:27] <toddparker> right now a basic popup with just a <p> inside doesn't have any L/R padding because we leave padding off for these widgets

[12:54:08] <toddparker> thoughts on how to elegantly handle a popup linking to another popup?
[12:54:14] <toddparker> right now, we close then re-open
[12:54:39] <toddparker> but i wonder if we should just replace the popup wrapper's contents with the new and do a  height/width transform
[12:54:48] <toddparker> sort of like a lightbox style
[12:54:51] <agcolom> I'd love to transition another popup into an existing open popup
[12:55:02] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I think we need to keep positioning in mind here ... where to place the popup that opens from another popup.
[12:55:09] <toddparker> this would give us a nice lightbox or drill able menu for free
[12:55:24] <agcolom> +1 from me
[12:55:50] <toddparker> agreed _|Nix|_ but I'm saying we re-position and re-size the popup instead of opening and closing
[12:55:54] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I guess it'd be nice for photograph sequences ...
[12:56:25] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... and crossfade the two payload divs?
[12:57:01] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: vertical-align middle on the img element will do
[12:57:12] <toddparker> yeah? cool
[12:57:19] <toddparker> yes, cross-fade
[12:57:33] <toddparker> be nice for linked menus like your example
[12:57:55] <toddparker> or a small tooltip with a "learn more…" link inside that opens to a larger popup
[12:57:57] <toddparker> http://krewenki.github.com/jquery-lightbox/
[12:58:06] <toddparker> like this but with better transforms
[12:58:09] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The size of the destination payload div would initially be restricted to the size of the origin payload div, until the resize animation completes. This may cause layout changes ...
[12:58:32] <toddparker> this: http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/
[12:59:14] <toddparker> resize > display
[12:59:40] <toddparker> well, render the next invisibly to get the dimensions to happen, then fade in opacity
[13:00:06] <toddparker> that's how these lighbox ones work i think
[13:00:18] <toddparker> small thing, but would make this much more powerful
[13:01:18] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Not really that small ... it completely changes the nature of the popup. It's no longer a self-contained widget, but a singleton with payload divs going in and out.
[13:02:17] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: What if you had a custom select inside a popup? Does it morph to the list inside the custom select?
[13:02:44] <agcolom> This one is quite nice also. uses VisualLightBox: http://visuallightbox.com/jquery-thickbox-iphone-demo.html
[13:02:46] <toddparker> yikes
[13:02:52] <toddparker> that is a good point
[13:03:27] <toddparker> maybe if we simply defaulted to a cross fade when going between popups that would be a simple first step
[13:03:31] <toddparker> instead of pop
[13:03:34] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So far, all these demos are photo sequences - popups are more generic than that, no?
[13:03:51] <toddparker> they are, just demonstrating the diminution tween, nothing else
[13:03:58] <toddparker> dimension tween
[13:04:02] <agcolom> yes, I thing it'd be nice to have a slide as well as option
[13:04:28] <agcolom> (for drill-down menu effect)
[13:06:09] <agcolom> or when you want the user to go through a sequence of 'pages' in a popup, for example when the popup content cannot all be displayed in one go because the screen is too small
[13:06:35] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Come to think of it, having a custom select inside a popup sort of kills the whole idea of mutually exclusive popups ... I mean, you make your choice inside the selection, but then you have to go back down the (long?) line of popups that lead you to the select in the first place.
[13:07:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ^
[13:07:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Did you get that? You just quit.
[13:09:44] <agcolom> Hi _|Nix|_ :-) where are you?
[13:14:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: In my living room.

[13:21:20] <agcolom> Yes, she's rubbish at getting up in the morning...
[13:22:37] <agcolom> BTW I'm not that old!!!! I just wanted to have kids early! now I can concentrate and do interesting stuff like jQuery Mobile ;-)
[13:24:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Good plan +1
[13:24:38] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... on that cheery note, I gotta go sterilize a bottle for the night, and turn in ...
[13:24:42] <_|Nix|_> L8R all!
[13:24:49] <agcolom> Goodnight!
[13:25:01] <uGoMobi_Jasper> _|Nix|_: good night!
[13:25:26] <agcolom> Same here I have a report to read for tomorrow... another crazy day of final year project vivas for me!
[13:26:06] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: good luck with that and good night!
[13:27:08] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper. I've been thinking of that example page... may need to wait friday morning before I can actually do something.... unless I still have enough energy tomorrow night...
[13:28:00] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: no worries. one day sooner or later doesnt matter
[13:30:16] <agcolom> I think we need one example per type of elements (i.e. we need to group all elements into categories, where the example would be identical apart from the name of the element, i.e. I guess adding checkboxes dynamically  would use the same code as for adding radio button, etc
[13:30:59] <agcolom> sorry I mean we need one example per category.
[13:31:01] <gseguin> johnbender: no objection, your honor
[13:31:30] <agcolom> Hi Ghislain :-)
[13:31:38] <johnbender> gseguin: since yours is the only feedback I will take it :D
[13:31:47] <gseguin> Hi Anne
[13:32:14] <gseguin> johnbender: though it's not going to be a widget per say, right just its own micro module
[13:32:18] <gseguin> is that right?
[13:32:20] <agcolom> I'm not touching git tonight, you are safe ;-)
[13:32:29] <gseguin> heh :)
[13:32:40] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: ok sounds good
[13:33:01] <gseguin> agcolom: the learning curve to git is pretty steep
[13:33:10] <uGoMobi_Jasper> hello west coast
[13:33:33] <gseguin> especially if you've been using SVN for too long
[13:33:40] <gseguin> hi uGoMobi_Jasper
[13:33:59] <gseguin> uGoMobi_Jasper: right coast ?
[13:34:00] <agcolom> gseguin: indeed! I'm glad I'm learning, but it makes my heart stop sometimes!!!
[13:34:29] <uGoMobi_Jasper> gseguin: west coast too, but of europe :)
[13:34:33] <gseguin> contrary to SVN, you can pretty much always recover git fails
[13:34:55] <gseguin> OH
[13:34:57] <agcolom> My experience was with sccs when I was teaching software quality 13-14 years ago !!!!
[13:35:21] <gseguin> jQM is going for worldwide domination!
[13:35:22] <agcolom> I did one tutotrial per year for 3 years,
[13:35:27] <uGoMobi_Jasper> lol
[13:35:43] <uGoMobi_Jasper> when occupy is done we take over ;-)
[13:35:56] <agcolom> and that's it. So I've done a deep dive!
[13:35:58] <gseguin> :)
[13:36:12] <gseguin> uGoMobi_Jasper: UK too?
[13:36:16] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: good thing you like to swim ;-)
[13:36:36] <uGoMobi_Jasper> gseguin: no, Amsterdam - The Netherlands
[13:37:10] <gseguin> oh cool
[13:38:35] <gseguin> I'm originally from France but left it a long time ago
[13:38:55] <agcolom> btw is there any data/statistics on how many sites use JQM ?
[13:39:08] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ^
[13:40:10] <uGoMobi_Jasper> gseguin: moved to the US for work?
[13:40:29] <gseguin> and life ;)
[13:40:35] <uGoMobi_Jasper> haha ok
[13:40:54] <uGoMobi_Jasper> californian wine as good as the french?
[13:41:14] <gseguin> if you put twice the price, yeah
[13:41:19] <johnbender> gseguin: I was thinking about using the widget factory for what it provides but it's not likely to be instantiated multiple times so maybe a simple singleton would be better
[13:41:33] <johnbender> gseguin: I also like the configuration convention we have for the widget prototypes
[13:41:45] <johnbender> $.mobile is really really crowded
[13:42:19] <gseguin> johnbender: ie?
[13:42:29] <johnbender> ?
[13:42:44] <gseguin> what did you mean?
[13:42:55] <gseguin> sorry I'm out of context
[13:42:57] <johnbender> ah
[13:43:02] <johnbender> for the loading message
[13:43:04] <johnbender> "widget"
[13:43:21] <toddparker> just fyi - i'm be traveling tomorrow so i'll be MIA
[13:44:25] <gseguin> oh that
[13:46:51] <uGoMobi_Jasper> johnbender: the new loading message widget... would it be possible to have different error messages for different error types?
[13:48:25] <johnbender> uGoMobi_Jasper: all things are possible :D
[13:48:40] <uGoMobi_Jasper> johnbender: good to know :)
[13:49:09] <uGoMobi_Jasper> but just different message for 404 and timeout would do
[13:50:12] <johnbender> uGoMobi_Jasper: my goal would be to make easy to monkey with/extend too
[13:51:59] <uGoMobi_Jasper> johnbender: thats always a good approach :)  was just looking into if i could accomplish it with current method but didnt figure it out yet
[13:54:29] <johnbender> uGoMobi_Jasper: you'd have to do two things
[13:54:35] <johnbender> uGoMobi_Jasper: bind to `pageloadfailed`
[13:54:53] <johnbender> get the error information from that to make a determination
[13:55:25] <toddparker> uGoMobi_Jasper and agcolom : it would be helpful if you could create a bunch of test pages/demos for the popup to both ensure that we're really hammering on the widget options and also thinking about creative uses of this
[13:55:25] <johnbender> and then monkey patch `showPageLoadingMsg` to change the message it sends when it recieves $.mobile.pageLoadErrorMessage
[13:55:29] <uGoMobi_Jasper> johnbender: ok thanks, will give it another try
[13:55:55] <toddparker> i'd also like to start adding examples of dynamically creating, populating, updating a widget like popups
[13:55:56] <johnbender> uGoMobi_Jasper: those two together would work but that's pretty tightly coupled with the internal ordering of events so it's fairly fragile
[13:56:08] <agcolom> toddparker: sure
[13:56:33] <toddparker> that index page is really rough. we need to write it out from start to finish and provide lots of good examples
[13:56:34] <uGoMobi_Jasper> johnbender: I see
[13:58:07] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: ok
[13:58:09] <agcolom> toddparker, btw I got the moveable possibility from twitter. If you launch twitter in the browser and press the compose new tweet, you get a popup. That popup is moveable.
[13:59:02] <agcolom> That makes me think also that if we have a textarea that streches as we type text, would the popup resize??
[14:03:29] <agcolom> it does!!!!
[14:03:51] <agcolom> see http://jsbin.com/okehir/23/ click the second form button
[14:04:40] <uGoMobi_Jasper> indeed!
[14:05:41] <agcolom> That's got to be in the demo page! It looks very clever!
[14:05:53] <toddparker> nice
[14:05:54] <uGoMobi_Jasper> haha for sure
[14:06:23] <toddparker> i'd like to build as many "real world" demos as we can to show the various uses of this and also test things like the text area expanding
[14:06:24] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: can we make a list somewhere of what kind examples we want?
[14:07:01] <toddparker> uGoMobi_Jasper: that's a good idea
[14:07:15] <toddparker> you could make a wiki page and link up some jsbins to illustrate the ideas
[14:07:20] <toddparker> we'll include the best ones
[14:07:35] <toddparker> these can use some custom styles if needed, just have a simple style block with overrides
[14:08:14] <toddparker> i think a scenario where you get a smaller tooltip that opens a larger detail would be cool. could use collapsible
[14:09:47] <agcolom> yes, that's a great idea.
[14:10:16] <uGoMobi_Jasper> toddparker: would it be possible to create the examples in the popup-widget branch instead of jsbin?
[14:10:30] <toddparker> seems like the data-transition is ignored if a link is inside a popup. I changed the first menu to use "none" the second :fade" and they all pop - http://jsbin.com/okehir/25
[14:10:43] <toddparker> yeah, totally uGoMobi_Jasper
[14:10:59] <toddparker> since you're not a committer quite yet, didn't know if that would be a pain
[14:11:07] <toddparker> but agcolom can just pull these in for you
[14:11:21] <agcolom> yes I'm happy to do that.
[14:11:33] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yeah, i'll just flag the PR's
[14:11:46] <agcolom> since we're in the same timezone, it shouldn't be too much of a problem.
[14:12:27] <uGoMobi_Jasper> jsbin will get messy bcos every time you save you have a new link
[14:12:55] <toddparker> agreed
[14:12:57] <agcolom> Also if all I need is to pull PRs in GitHub, I can do it at anytime, when I have to cherry-pick I need to be at home
[14:13:07] <toddparker> also think a bit about how padding should work by default
[14:13:29] <toddparker> the cherry picking won't really matter here anyway since it's a branch
[14:13:39] <toddparker> these won't end up in 1.1.1 :)
[14:14:08] <toddparker> think it's good to get a few different people looking at this widget to put it through it's paces and improve the docs
[14:14:37] <uGoMobi_Jasper> for sure
[14:14:46] <toddparker> we'll just have to be careful about keeping the scope on point, we want to make the simplest widget we can that is as flexible as possible
[14:15:43] <agcolom> yep! So the idea is we create a new file under the popup branch?
[14:16:33] <uGoMobi_Jasper> i think many examples and showing that all is accomplished with same simple code points that out
[14:17:00] <uGoMobi_Jasper> new folder probably
[14:17:06] <agcolom> ok
[14:17:31] <agcolom> makes sense so we can include images as well...
[14:18:13] <uGoMobi_Jasper> yes
[14:18:37] <uGoMobi_Jasper> i noticed filament group has nice pics of Amsterdam
[14:18:54] <uGoMobi_Jasper> when checking their pagination plugin :)
[14:19:47] <agcolom> yes, they're very nice. I didn't know they were of Amsterdam
[14:20:21] <toddparker> scott was there for a conference
[14:20:25] <uGoMobi_Jasper> they are taken within a mile from my house
[14:20:35] <uGoMobi_Jasper> oh ok, cool
[14:20:41] <toddparker> yeah, feel free to make folders inside the popup folder for more complex examples
[14:20:45] <toddparker> no way!
[14:21:13] <uGoMobi_Jasper> thats what I said when I saw them ;)
[14:22:14] <agcolom> ok, really report reading time for me... and then sleep ;-) Goodnight Europe and Have a good afternoon/evening USA.
[14:22:38] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: when I open a PR with a commit you can leave the PR open right? so I can do another commit later?
[14:23:24] <uGoMobi_Jasper> agcolom: good night (again)!
[14:23:30] <agcolom> Yes, I think, as long as I haven't merged it in GitHub you can continue to push to it.
[14:23:38] <agcolom> I think
[14:24:14] <uGoMobi_Jasper> ok, then we keep the comments thread of that one PR as a place to discuss what kind of examples
[14:24:26] <uGoMobi_Jasper> we can try it out later
[14:24:52] <agcolom> So if you want to do that, maybe add a comment to say when you want me to pull in your PR
[14:25:18] <uGoMobi_Jasper> ok
[14:25:27] <agcolom> cool! Goodnight again :-)
[14:34:29] <toddparker> goodnight all
[14:34:32] <toddparker> heading out myself
[14:35:06] <uGoMobi_Jasper> good night todd!
[14:55:14] <uGoMobi_Jasper> I'm off too... good evening/night all!
