[07:18:46] <Wilto> ’Morning, guys.
[07:28:39] <toddmparker_> morning
[07:38:17] <Dragooon> Hello
[07:38:40] <Dragooon> Not trying to bug about an WIP, but the transitions are pretty broken in HEAD of out-in
[08:32:49] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: gseguin: I submitted my PE for the mobile web talk to oscon
[08:33:12] <johnbender> luckily I got my hands on the panel recording from qconsf
[08:33:24] <johnbender> and I was pleasantly surprised
[08:33:30] * johnbender hates watching himself present
[08:33:47] <johnbender> it could be said that I did not look like a complete douce
[08:33:49] <johnbender> *douche
[08:37:39] <Wilto> Dude, knowing that someone is recording a talk freaks me right out.
[08:38:38] <Wilto> 1,000 people? No big. Video? I want out.
[08:39:49] <Wilto> However: send that sucker around, man!
[08:40:09] <johnbender> Wilto: it's semi worthless without the infoq setup where they run the slides in tandem with the video
[08:40:22] <johnbender> sadly that will be out in march
[08:40:29] <johnbender> but when it comes out I'll send it around
[08:40:32] <johnbender> hmm
[08:40:46] <johnbender> although it would be nice to make sure what I'm saying in the presentation is accurate
[08:41:28] <Wilto> Happy to review stuff, man.
[08:41:50] <johnbender> Wilto: http://johnbender.github.com/presentation-mobile-bakeoff
[08:41:53] <johnbender> slides are there
[08:41:58] <johnbender> but they are worthless without the presentation
[08:42:08] <johnbender> I don't really make slides that stand on their own :(
[08:45:19] <Wilto> Mine mostly involve swearing at the audience.
[08:46:11] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/a11y-talk.png / http://wil.to/_/rwd-talk.png
[08:50:44] <Wilto> This presentation looks legit to me.
[08:51:32] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender - think we need some help landing transitions
[08:51:46] <gseguin> morning
[08:52:22] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[08:52:27] <toddmparker_> might need your help too
[08:52:49] * gseguin catches up
[08:55:27] <gseguin> toddmparker_: what can I do?
[08:55:29] <Wilto> Dragooon: You’re walking onto a construction site and telling the workers that the building is drafty, man.
[08:55:35] <toddmparker_> so the "out-in-transition" branch is ready to move to master. It's looking sharp, FF10 support is in and all unit tests seem to be passing
[08:55:45] <toddmparker_> gseguin and johnbender ^^
[08:55:53] <Wilto> Dragooon: Rest assured, such things will be fixed for an official release.
[08:55:56] <toddmparker_> BUT there are 2 things we need you guys to help with
[08:56:20] * gseguin listens
[08:56:41] <toddmparker_> 1. the new transition js files are not set up with the AMD stuff yet. There is a js file per transition now.
[08:56:53] <toddmparker_> hoping gseguin can look at that.
[08:57:05] <gseguin> yup
[08:57:14] <Wilto> Yeah. I wouldn’t mind getting a quick recap of what’s involved with that, too—I gotta study up on AMD-izing things.
[08:57:31] <Wilto> gseguin: If you’ve got a sec, could you jot down some notes?
[08:57:40] <toddmparker_> 2. We're predicting that the merge in might get tricky (conflicts, etc.). Scott asked johnbender to be the one to land this baby
[08:57:58] <gseguin> sure thing Wilto
[08:58:30] <toddmparker_> maybe we can add a wiki page on how the AMD works so 3rd party devs can use our conventions too?
[08:58:36] <toddmparker_> not sure that's needed but hey
[08:58:41] <gseguin> I'll checkout that branch and look at it
[08:59:00] <toddmparker_> but i'd like to get this into master today if we can. these long living branches get tricky
[08:59:21] <toddmparker_> tho for this, it was needed. we must have made 6-8 branches as we iterated through ideas for transitions
[08:59:55] <toddmparker_> so i dunno what's on your plates today johnbender and gseguin, but this should be a priority\
[08:59:59] <toddmparker_> cool, thanks gseguin
[09:00:07] <Wilto> Thanks, gseguin!
[09:00:19] <toddmparker_> and don't be confused - there is a "fade-out-in-transition" branch = that's NOT the right one
[09:00:46] <gseguin> so Wilto you want like a how to convert a jquery plugin to AMD?
[09:01:13] <gseguin> or just what's involved in AMDizing
[09:01:46] <toddmparker_> think the latter
[09:01:49] <Wilto> Actually, when you put it that way, maybe I could just dig up a couple of blog posts…
[09:01:55] <Wilto> I mean, the latter would definitely help, yeah.
[09:01:56] <toddmparker_> when we make a new plugin, what needs to happen
[09:02:53] <gseguin> 'k i'll write up something
[09:02:55] <toddmparker_> we also need to figure out a plan on the concatenation stuff on the branch preview. it's super slow to load up a page initially
[09:03:02] <gseguin> first let's take a look at that branch
[09:03:07] <toddmparker_> kk
[09:03:09] <toddmparker_> thanks!
[09:07:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: catching up
[09:07:54] <gseguin> toddmparker_: there is no real big confiict
[09:08:14] <gseguin> I just merged master onto out-in-transition
[09:08:23] <Wilto> Oh, sweet.
[09:08:28] <gseguin> I have 3 easy to solve conflicts
[09:08:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's actually a really bad idea for me to resolve the conflicts for you
[09:08:52] <johnbender> since I don't know what changes you made
[09:08:56] <gseguin> bender you want to deal with it or you don't mind me doing it?
[09:08:59] <johnbender> we can work together on them though
[09:09:02] <johnbender> gseguin: go for it
[09:09:08] <Wilto> I mean, if nothing’s on fire I think we’re good.
[09:09:09] <johnbender> just make sure to ask if you're not sure
[09:09:18] <gseguin> yeah but the conflicts are really simple to figure out in this case johnbender
[09:09:21] <Wilto> We just had nightmarish visions of burning down the whole repo.
[09:09:57] <gseguin> so here is what I'm doing, can you validate?
[09:10:03] <johnbender> gseguin: sure
[09:10:13] <Wilto> Appreciate it, guys.
[09:10:23] <gseguin> 1. git checkout out-in-transition
[09:10:36] <gseguin> 2. git merge upstream/master
[09:10:43] <Dragooon> Nice, transitions finally work quite okay in Android 4
[09:10:46] <gseguin> 3. resolve conflicts
[09:10:52] <gseguin> 4. git commit
[09:11:06] <gseguin> 5. add amd wrappers to transitions modules
[09:11:07] <johnbender> gseguin: why the merge into the branch first?
[09:11:11] <johnbender> ah!
[09:11:15] <johnbender> now it makes sense :D
[09:11:19] <johnbender> continue
[09:11:30] <gseguin> 6. git add & commit
[09:11:47] <gseguin> 7. git merge out-in-transition master
[09:11:52] <gseguin> 8. git push
[09:12:01] <johnbender> gseguin: I think you can just add the wrappers and merge to master
[09:12:07] <johnbender> thereby avoiding an extra merge
[09:12:10] <johnbender> but either way really
[09:12:23] <gseguin> yeah that's right
[09:12:31] <gseguin> ok I'll do that
[09:12:40] <johnbender> gseguin: 9. profit
[09:12:50] <gseguin> heh :)
[09:14:00] <imjoshdean> johnbender: You forgot the all important middle step of ???
[09:14:55] <johnbender> imjoshdean: you mean the "wtfjusthappenedgitcanbereallconfusingsometimes" step?
[09:15:16] <imjoshdean> johnbender: That's the one.
[09:19:49] <Wilto> Switching to dual displays and a Magic Trackpad, and I don’t think I’m able to use a computer anymore.
[09:20:52] <gseguin> Wilto: it makes going back to just a laptop very very painful
[09:21:27] <Wilto> Freelancing made me very have-gun-will-travel, just working on my MacBook with no peripherals.
[09:21:43] <Wilto> But everyone says multiple displays do unreal things for productivity, so…
[09:22:56] <johnbender> Wilto: I use two screens but the productivity gains are minor for the most part
[09:23:10] <johnbender> I think people would be better served in getting used to keeping their hands off the mouse tbh
[09:25:32] <Dragooon> Do you guys have a Galaxy Nexus for testing?
[09:25:44] <johnbender> Dragooon: I don't think we do actually :(
[09:26:07] <Wilto> Dragooon: No ICS gadgets in the lab just yet.
[09:26:13] <Dragooon> Oh
[09:26:24] <Wilto> Why; what’s up?
[09:26:33] <gseguin> I've got ICS on my Vibrant, but that's not an official ROM
[09:26:45] <Dragooon> Nothing, just that testing for ICS support would be a nice thing
[09:26:51] <Dragooon> gseguin: So do I on my Galaxy S and Note
[09:27:01] <Dragooon> It seems single core ICS phones got a problem with transitions, but dual cores just work fine
[09:27:02] <Wilto> Oh, no question.
[09:27:13] <johnbender> ...
[09:27:15] <johnbender> just
[09:27:16] <johnbender> brutal
[09:27:19] <Wilto> AGREED
[09:27:34] <Dragooon> s/just/
[09:27:46] <johnbender> as much as I like the Galaxy Nexus, I refuse to pay for another android phone until they fix the browser
[09:27:55] <toddmparker_> yeah, Dragooon from what I'm hearing ICS will only work well on higher end software
[09:28:17] <Dragooon> s/software/hardware
[09:28:23] <toddmparker_> folks upgrading, esp. with unsupported ROMs are in for a world of hurt performance-wise
[09:28:27] <Dragooon> Surprisingly ICS performs better on my Galaxy S(As in the end experience)
[09:28:43] <Dragooon> But the browser's transitions are handled quite well on my Note
[09:28:50] <Wilto> Galaxy S is single core?
[09:28:51] <toddmparker_> Samsung permanently pulled the ICS upgrade for the Nexus S
[09:28:54] <toddmparker_> among others
[09:28:55] <Dragooon> toddmparker_: Both my devices are using unsupported ROMs
[09:29:03] <Dragooon> Wilto: Yes
[09:29:14] <Wilto> Oh, THAT’s the line. Single core gadgets aren’t getting it.
[09:29:15] <Wilto> I was wondering how they were making that distinction.
[09:29:18] <toddmparker_> yeah, gseguin has a similar setup and it's pretty pokey
[09:29:41] <Dragooon> Didn't Nexus S get it?
[09:30:47] <Dragooon> Oh, they pulled it back. Shame
[09:30:49] <toddmparker_> nope
[09:31:01] <toddmparker_> they roleld it out, then pulled it a few minutes later
[09:31:15] <Wilto> Man, we are gonna be super embarrassed when this whole “mobile phone” fad dies out.
[09:31:21] <Wilto> Not to mention this “internet” dealie.
[09:31:24] <Wilto> Never gonna catch on.
[09:31:37] <toddmparker_> http://www.theverge.com/2011/12/20/2650190/nexus-s-android-4-0-update-paused-while-google-looks-at-issues
[09:32:11] <Dragooon> Ah well, within those few minutes people were able to port missing features to unofficial builds for Galaxy S and related phones
[09:33:25] <toddmparker_> yeah
[09:33:27] <Dragooon> Now what jQM needs is an official split view plugin and you're golden :P
[09:33:37] <toddmparker_> lots of people have upgraded in the forums and it's bad news all around
[09:33:55] <toddmparker_> my only hope is the 3.0 tablets get upgraded because honeycomb is a hit mess
[09:34:08] <toddmparker_> gseguin and johnbender - thanks for landing that. fast!
[09:34:22] <Dragooon> hit mess?
[09:34:30] <Wilto> Hell, I’d be fine with a forced update from Android 3.0 to Windows 3.11 for Workgroups.
[09:34:35] <Wilto> Dragooon: “Hot mess.”
[09:34:49] <Dragooon> Oh
[09:41:37] <Dragooon> Actually on my Galaxy S, out transitions are fairly okay
[09:43:07] <gseguin> Welcome JasonDScott!
[09:43:16] <johnbender> JasonDScott: heyo!
[09:46:03] <JasonDScott> Hey
[09:50:57] <JasonDScott> For those who don't know me, I am with RIM and I'm here to help with BlackBerry specific issues.
[09:51:08] <johnbender> JasonDScott: and we're glad for it
[09:51:11] <johnbender> :D
[09:51:41] <johnbender> also, we require that you divulge any and all insider information on when the first qnx boldish phone is coming out
[09:51:49] <johnbender> s/we/I/ :D
[09:52:11] <JasonDScott> :D
[09:52:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[09:52:31] <johnbender> triage BB bugs thataway
[09:52:39] <JasonDScott> I'll see if I can get some test devices for you guys when they become available
[09:53:00] <johnbender> JasonDScott: I believe that effort is under way
[09:53:06] <toddmparker_> hey JasonDScott
[09:53:09] <toddmparker_> welcome
[09:53:12] <johnbender> and we really really appreciate it
[09:53:51] <toddmparker_> i already tagged a bunch of BB issues for you. You'll regret volunteering to help out :p
[09:53:52] <JasonDScott> Thanks toddmparker
[09:54:21] <toddmparker_> been updating the transitions ticket with details as we go
[09:54:38] <toddmparker_> my latest update: "...So our transition strategy for Android looking like this: exclude 1-2.x, hope 3.x goes away, and pray that 4.0 is actually decent. Sort of sad, but given the state of things, this seems like the best approach."
[09:54:45] <Wilto> Psst, toddmparker_: Quietly edit some of the Android issues to say “BlackBerry.”
[09:54:54] <toddmparker_> ok, so just confirm
[09:54:59] <toddmparker_> wilto :)
[09:55:16] <toddmparker_> wilto: so FF10 is now working on all types?
[09:55:23] <Wilto> Yessir.
[09:55:34] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: what's their animation complete function?
[09:55:38] <johnbender> I assume that was the change?
[09:55:50] <toddmparker_> FF?
[09:55:56] <Wilto> Un-prefixed `animationend`
[09:56:09] <johnbender> cool
[09:56:15] <johnbender> yay standards
[09:56:26] <johnbender> do any of the webkits support the non prefixed version?
[09:56:26] <Wilto> It ain’t in window or anything, so don’t go lookin’ for it there.
[09:56:33] <Wilto> Not to my knowledge.
[09:56:39] <johnbender> Wilto: where is it?
[09:56:59] <Wilto> In our hearts, I guess? I couldn’t test for it easily.
[09:57:07] <johnbender> ???
[09:57:07] <johnbender> wtf
[09:57:10] <Wilto> I forget what I did.
[09:57:13] <Wilto> You’re tellin’ me.
[09:58:13] <Wilto> Testing in FF is getting a little goofy.
[09:59:10] <Wilto> For the transition test I had to create a div in the aether, set a `style` attribute with a transition, and check style.MozTransition.
[09:59:21] <johnbender> that's what I figured
[09:59:38] <johnbender> or, I figured you'd be doing dom manip to find out
[09:59:44] <Wilto> Maybe they’ll fix it in Firefox 17, due out later on this afternoon.
[09:59:47] <Wilto> Or 24.
[09:59:49] <Wilto> Who can keep count.
[10:00:08] <toddmparker_> johnbender: what we do is like making sausage or laws...you don't want to know what happens, just enjoy the outcome.
[10:00:09] <johnbender> Wilto: there is no release, only software
[10:00:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes, the library is a huge collection of hacks
[10:00:22] <Wilto> Slash zuul.
[10:00:31] <johnbender> that's what jquery is designed to be
[10:00:34] <toddmparker_> not hacks..."finesse"
[10:00:42] <Wilto> I like “finesse” better.
[10:00:52] <johnbender> you guys can keep your marketing degrees
[10:00:53] <toddmparker_> but yeah, hacks
[10:01:10] <Wilto> jMonkey Punching.
[10:01:14] <Wilto> Duck punch?
[10:01:30] <johnbender> Wilto: Floor Punch
[10:01:35] <Wilto> Monkey punch? I forget which is the Flash game, and which is the technique.
[10:01:53] <johnbender> Wilto: Monkey *patch*
[10:01:54] <johnbender> ?
[10:02:30] <Wilto> That’s the one!
[10:02:35] <Wilto> I’m new to this stuff; don’t mind me.
[10:02:39] <gseguin> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/a83727e4bed324e292e20f9ae48f0c8e3b25f9fd/docs/_assets/js/jqm-docs.js
[10:02:55] <gseguin> that first .live you removed it in master, correct?
[10:04:29] <Wilto> I should think so…
[10:04:31] <Wilto> One sec.
[10:05:54] * kinblas laughs at the conersation
[10:09:46] <gseguin> ok are you guys ready ?
[10:10:30] <gseguin> are you ready to get your mind blown by uber awesome transitions on master?
[10:14:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: are we aiming to release 1.0.1 this week?
[10:15:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to out-in-transition: http://git.io/Fmb9qA
[10:15:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/out-in-transition] AMDized transition code - Ghislain Seguin
[10:15:38] <gseguin> stand-up time, brb
[10:15:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/y5hEog
[10:15:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge branch 'out-in-transition' - Ghislain Seguin
[10:15:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Finished merging branch 'out-in-transition', I had trailing commas in there instead of semi-colons - Ghislain Seguin
[10:17:13] <Dragooon> General question, with all the changes in transitions in 1.1, can I still add a class to an element(say slide down in) and expect it to perform as well as normal page transitions?
[10:18:18] <toddmparker_> Dragooon: you're using the page transitions on elements?
[10:18:30] <toddmparker_> we haven't done a lot of testing on that, not sure
[10:18:52] <toddmparker_> most of the work was re-arranging the sequence of events and refining transitions
[10:18:57] <toddmparker_> migtht work fine
[10:18:59] <Dragooon> toddmparker_: Yes, I made a sort of popup box that slides down
[10:19:15] <toddmparker_> gseguin - i'm ready!!
[10:19:27] <toddmparker_> gotcha Dragooon
[10:19:31] <toddmparker_> give it a try and report back
[10:20:18] <Dragooon> I will, just waiting for out-in to be merged with master
[10:20:23] <toddmparker_> johnbender: i think early next week is prolly realistic for 1.0.1
[10:20:44] <toddmparker_> we can discuss today
[10:20:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: cool
[10:25:52] <Wilto> Sorry, back, an emergency sub run was required.
[10:27:43] <toddmparker_> so gseguin - is the deed totally done?
[10:27:47] <Wilto> Hoagie? Grinder? I only speak Boston.
[10:27:55] <Wilto> Anyway, looking into that live() thing.
[10:28:26] <Wilto> Oh, wait, merged.
[10:28:53] <toddmparker_> test isn't up to date :/
[10:29:01] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[10:29:07] <Wilto> ?mlm
[10:29:08] <bot-t> much like myself
[10:29:10] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge ^^
[10:29:48] <Wilto> Pulled master conflict-free.
[10:31:37] <eddiemonge> "Your branch is behind 'origin/master' by 141 commits, and can be fast-forwarded"
[10:31:40] <eddiemonge> jiminy!
[10:32:33] <eddiemonge> updated
[10:33:22] <johnbender> eddiemonge: given how much time has elapse that's super tiny
[10:33:28] <johnbender> all that work on branches
[10:33:30] <johnbender> which is really good
[10:33:33] <johnbender> yay branches
[10:34:46] <toddmparker_> go team go!
[10:34:47] <Wilto> How I lived before git is completely beyond me, now.
[10:34:57] <toddmparker_> yep
[10:35:12] <toddmparker_> let's switch to SVN
[10:35:18] <toddmparker_> or googlecode
[10:35:42] <Dragooon> Yay!
[10:35:43] <Wilto> Or sending zip files to each other.
[10:35:56] * Dragooon clones
[10:35:58] <Wilto> CD-ROMs with “50 free hours of jQuery Mobile.”
[10:36:36] <toddmparker_> nice
[10:36:42] <toddmparker_> thanks eddiemonge - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[10:36:43] <johnbender> Wilto: that would be incredibly funny
[10:36:44] <toddmparker_> BOOM
[10:37:03] <Wilto> If I ever do a jQM talk, I am totally giving those out to the audience.
[10:38:01] <Dragooon> This is funny
[10:38:17] <Dragooon> Chrome crashed as soon as I opened that page
[10:40:16] <gseguin> So just tested on a Galaxy Nexus and transitions suck pretty hard
[10:40:27] <gseguin> yes toddmparker_ the merge is done
[10:40:42] <johnbender> gseguin: always good to hear
[10:40:54] <gseguin> I'm going to make a video of transitions on Galaxy Nexus
[10:41:04] <toddmparker_> Dragooon: chrome crashed? what the...
[10:41:10] <toddmparker_> fine on mine - you on windows?
[10:41:28] <toddmparker_> gseguin: going to re-test android 2.x now
[10:41:35] <Dragooon> toddmparker_: Probably a glitch, works fine now
[10:42:04] <toddmparker_> i think anyone who upgraded to ICS unofficially is going to have a tough time in general
[10:42:11] <toddmparker_> Dragooon: interesting
[10:42:25] <gseguin> eddiemonge: can you incorporate a call to make in the deploy of /test ?
[10:42:33] <toddmparker_> the amd stuff makes that page crazy load to load up, going to fix that ASAP
[10:42:42] <gseguin> I'd like to compile the css and js
[10:43:03] <gseguin> toddmparker_: that's what I was just pinging eddiemonge about
[10:43:08] <gseguin> it's very simple
[10:43:13] <eddiemonge> gseguin: i dont think test needs to be compiled. it can reference the cdn
[10:43:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: we want it to point to the latest though
[10:43:32] <Dragooon> Actually transitions seem to be working quite well for me on my Note
[10:43:34] <johnbender> unless we're puting latest on the cdn
[10:43:34] <eddiemonge> whenever /test is updated, the cdn gets compiled and pushed as well
[10:43:40] <johnbender> ah
[10:43:45] <gseguin> eddiemonge: we want the modules to be in one bundle
[10:43:50] <toddmparker_> yeah, saw that gseguin
[10:44:19] <toddmparker_> ...and compressed
[10:44:26] <gseguin> so still not in production mode but at least avoid the zillion HTTP requests
[10:44:30] <Dragooon> Transitions are almost flawless for me :P
[10:44:39] <gseguin> toddmparker_: on /test I wouldn't minify
[10:44:58] <toddmparker_> right, makes sense
[10:45:20] <toddmparker_> but just reducing # of requests will make a huge difference
[10:45:32] <Dragooon> There's about a 200-300ms delay in them starting, but if one ignores that, they're smooth
[10:46:05] <eddiemonge> and thats just for docs right?
[10:46:35] <Dragooon> Can't you minify on the fly?
[10:47:44] <gseguin> yes eddiemonge
[10:47:57] <gseguin> I'll make a target in the Makefile
[10:48:05] <gseguin> I worked on it yesterday
[10:49:46] <toddmparker_> Dragooon: that delay is probably just that we wait for the click event to hit, can't rely on touch events b/c of Android
[10:50:18] <toddmparker_> Wilto: any idea why you get the odd shadow on hover in the right col of buttons here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[10:50:23] <Dragooon> toddmparker_: Apart from that, the transitions are near perfect
[10:50:50] <toddmparker_> Wilto: you need to click a link, go back, then hover
[10:51:06] <eddiemonge> gseguin: can you add it to the latest target?
[10:51:32] * gseguin looks
[10:52:27] <Wilto> Diagnosis: shenanigans.
[10:52:45] <Wilto> Chrome just being a little weird about rendering shadows post-3D-transform.
[10:52:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Could you please merge #3323 into popup? The custom select equivalent has already been merged into master (#3329) ...
[10:55:28] <_|Nix|_> join #jquery-meeting
[10:55:31] <_|Nix|_> Ooops :)

[10:59:44] <gseguin> johnbender, Wilto, kinblas, JasonDScott, eddiemonge, toddmparker_, garann: ^^^
[10:59:50] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: Let's discuss in the call
[11:01:54] <gseguin> http://vimeo.com/34968834
[11:56:29] <garann> oh shoot - sorry for missing the meeting
[11:56:42] <garann> nothing to report, gonna look at that slider bug tonight or tomorrow
[12:02:36] <Wilto> FIRED
[12:02:48] <toddmparker_> thanks garann
[12:03:02] <toddmparker_> Wilto: you're FIRED. keep it classy.
[12:03:11] <Wilto> aww
[12:03:18] <Wilto> That’s like the third time in one meeting.
[12:03:25] <toddmparker_> animals around here
[12:06:29] <garann> Wilto: you can't fire me unless you start paying me :P
[12:08:24] <gseguin> :)
[12:08:37] <gseguin> oh man eddiemonge is gone
[12:11:13] <Wilto> I was advised to go work at a burrito stand.
[12:13:56] <imjoshdean> Wilto: There's always pesos in the burrito stand
[12:23:35] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #387: STILL FAILING in 1 hr 10 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/387/
[12:23:36] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: Much of the scripting in nav.js's transitionPages function was tied to the animation sequence for our css3transitionhandler. For example, the order was, scroll to top, run transitions, then scroll to the remembered location of the new page (there's more involved, but that's the gist of it). If we want to expand beyond this sequence, much of that scripting needs to move to the css3transitionhandler itself, and also to our "none"
[12:23:37] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed commented out line
[12:23:37] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: gif-based loader animation
[12:23:38] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added fade out in transition handler
[12:23:38] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added fade out in transition handler file
[12:23:38] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: hard-set opacity for "out" to prevent blinks
[12:23:39] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed code to set css3transitionhandler as the default
[12:23:40] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: gif loader styles
[12:23:40] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: gif loader style updates
[12:23:40] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added loader test page for local testing
[12:23:41] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: Loader design tweaks
[12:23:42] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: More loader tweaks
[12:23:42] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed unused image
[12:23:43] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: for now, removed any difference between framework transition defaults and the docs. We might want to bring this back and recommend it though - I'm not sure how easy it'll be to bring it in standard with the ability to configure.
[12:23:43] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: default transition type goes to fade
[12:23:44] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: an attempt at simplification. not there yet...
[12:23:44] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: All new loader hotness
[12:23:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added new filename to make and combiner files
[12:23:56] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: fixed up the pop out transition for outin handler
[12:23:56] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: updated the slide and flip handlers to use combo fade/slide/flip transitions
[12:23:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed spin because we aren't using it no mo
[12:23:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: a little faster on the fades. needs cleanup later
[12:23:58] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: rolled that last one back.
[12:23:58] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: Broke out the global and in and out transition rules for asymmetric timing
[12:23:59] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: Updated -moz out to match
[12:23:59] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: Added a feature test for css 3d transforms, which will allow us to conditionally apply the flip transition (AKA cartwheel, where unsupported).
[12:24:00] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: fixed a typo in the query
[12:24:00] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: add class for 3d transform support
[12:24:01] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: woops. add it whether it's supported or not :)
[12:24:01] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: for non-3d browsers, use fade instead of flip
[12:24:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: lowercased
[12:24:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: not needed, as flip already uses fade now in the "in" transition.
[12:24:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: dontmove is no longer in use
[12:24:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: tweaked scale and duration of some flip and pop transitions
[12:24:04] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: split transition CSS into separate files.
[12:24:15] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: z index not needed
[12:24:16] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed z-index rules, no longer needed
[12:24:16] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed "none" transition handler from Nav.js. Updated the new out-in transition handler so that it supports "none" transitions in addition to our new default css3 animation sequence. The new transition handler is set as the default, and available publicly as $.mobile.defaultTransitionHandler and $.mobile.transitionHandlers["default"].
[12:24:17] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: updated docs page to describe the new transition handler and how it works.
[12:24:17] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: updated the rotate transition to move the page out of view
[12:24:18] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: Added a new core option called maxTransitionWidth, which defaults to 1000. Accepts any number or false value. If it's not false, the handler will use a "none" transition when the window width is wider than the specified value. This is useful because transitions get very wonky on wider screens.
[12:24:18] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: updated docs to describe the maxTransitionWidth option.
[12:24:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: Updated page transition scripting/support test to allow for Firefox.
[12:24:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed fallback transition CSS for non-3D browsers
[12:24:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: split the slide transitions into 3 files for slide, slidedown, and slideup
[12:24:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed the experimental rotate transition
[12:24:21] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: implemented fallback transition definitions for non-3D-supporting browsers, for all transitions except "fade". By default, these are all set to fall back to "fade", and they'll fall back to "none" if 3D is unsupported and no fallback is defined. They can be overridden at mobileinit, like any other jQM default.
[12:24:21] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: better comment
[12:24:22] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed rotate transition from concat files and docs
[12:24:22] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added an experimental 3D transition, "flow"
[12:24:23] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: changed up the timing and origin
[12:24:23] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: pulled out the 3D madness
[12:24:24] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: better check for supporting fallback
[12:24:35] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: if there's an overlay theme, we're going to remove it from the page container. First though, check that the incoming page isn't a dialog with the same overlay theme. If so, don't remove the class, as it'll remove it for the next one too
[12:24:36] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Updated 3d transform test to accomodate FF10.
[12:24:37] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Turned maxTransitionWidth to false by default
[12:24:37] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Re-vamp of transition button design, added page demos
[12:24:37] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: SetScrollBack to 10 (from 250), CSS tweaks to table
[12:24:38] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Tweaked max width blurb to match the "false" default to avoid confusion
[12:24:38] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Removed blurb about shutting off transitions over 1,000 pixels
[12:24:39] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: class name was body instead of overlay. Fixed
[12:24:39] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: CSS for ui-overlay-x applies to container now too - removed double class
[12:24:40] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: code style
[12:24:40] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: no longer need this class addition
[12:24:41] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added missing files
[12:24:41] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: removed old link
[12:24:42] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: no bg image/gradient on ui-overlay
[12:24:42] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: fix up dialog presentation - headers were busted
[12:24:43] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: fixed some typos where webkit needed to be moz
[12:24:43] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: added the timing durations to the transitions themselves
[12:24:44] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * scott: combined redundant syntax
[12:36:01] <johnbender> And thus was the world brought to being
[12:37:20] <johnbender> that one has a TON of failures
[12:37:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto:
[12:38:06] <johnbender> TON being like 6
[12:39:46] <toddmparker_> ?
[12:39:57] <toddmparker_> that is the transition stuff
[12:40:11] <toddmparker_> thought it was passing tests
[12:40:15] <toddmparker_> didn't see a fail email
[12:41:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: hmm I got one
[12:54:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: still no email?
[12:54:58] <johnbender> should I forward it to you guys?
[12:56:21] <toddmparker_> nope, it came in afterwards
[12:56:28] <toddmparker_> got it johnbender
[12:57:03] <toddmparker_> wilto - have a moment to give these a look?
[13:02:55] <rwaldron> johnbender or toddmparker_ where can i find a hosted jquery mobile "git build" (or similar)?
[13:03:07] <rwaldron> i wnt to try out the new transistion-fu for a client project
[13:03:19] <rwaldron> to see if it can help with some issues
[13:03:29] <rwaldron> also, the fixed nav updates
[13:03:30] <rwaldron> all of it
[13:03:33] <rwaldron> gimme moar
[13:03:36] <rwaldron> :)
[13:05:19] <toddmparker_> go for it
[13:05:29] <toddmparker_> it's easier now that transition are in master
[13:05:46] <toddmparker_> the fixed stuff is just a few files you can grab from that branch
[13:05:50] <toddmparker_> pretty self-contained
[13:05:56] <toddmparker_> rwaldron ^^
[13:06:10] <rwaldron> ok
[13:06:18] <toddmparker_> i don't think there is a hosted build tool
[13:06:27] <toddmparker_> tho gseguin had something rigged up
[13:06:43] <rwaldron> i meant, is there a built version of it for demo purpose only?
[13:06:50] <rwaldron> that i could use for like... 10 minutes?
[13:08:11] <toddmparker_> are you looking for a prebuilt js + css version that combines fixed with master?
[13:08:17] <toddmparker_> don't have that yet
[13:11:55] <johnbender> rwaldron: yah you'll have to do the build yourself
[13:12:06] <johnbender> unless I misunderstand what you want
[13:12:28] <rwaldron> i'm being lazy
[13:13:22] <gseguin> johnbender: eddiemonge being offline I can't ask him
[13:13:37] <gseguin> how does /latest work, do you know?
[13:13:52] <gseguin> sorry, how does /test work?
[13:13:55] <johnbender> gseguin: one sec I'll get you the link
[13:14:17] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile.com/blob/master/gitpostcommit.php
[13:14:45] <johnbender> it's handled by a post commit web hook configured at github
[13:15:26] <johnbender> gseguin: `make latest`
[13:15:42] <johnbender> gseguin: what is it you guys are trying to accomplish, I zoned out a bit when you were discussing this
[13:15:46] <gseguin> but if you look at the latest target
[13:15:59] <gseguin> I don't see it copying the docs
[13:16:32] <gseguin> I trying to do a whole project optimization as in: http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#wholeproject. 
[13:16:56] <gseguin> http://requirejs.org/docs/optimization.html#wholeproject
[13:17:06] <johnbender> gseguin: where is it supposed to be copying the docs too
[13:17:07] <gseguin> ( no trailing dot )
[13:17:11] <johnbender> I'm looking at the zip target
[13:17:16] <gseguin> heh you tell me
[13:17:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: from whence do people download our docs
[13:17:40] <gseguin> oh so the docs are zip / transferred and unzipped ?
[13:17:50] <johnbender> dunno
[13:19:31] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm it might just end up in the ${OUTPUT} dir which is scp'd to the cdn in the makefile
[13:19:42] <johnbender> still trying to find the link where it references the docs target
[13:20:08] <johnbender> gseguin: are you sure that latest builds the docs at all?
[13:20:11] <gseguin> I'm confused
[13:20:15] <johnbender> it looks like deploy does
[13:20:16] <johnbender> but not docs
[13:20:22] <gseguin> the zip target does not refer to docs
[13:20:27] <johnbender> correct
[13:20:39] <johnbender> in fact the comment says it's explicity *without* the docs
[13:20:55] <johnbender> gseguin: nightlies does build the docs
[13:21:00] <gseguin> how does it get the docs? on /test ?
[13:21:27] <johnbender> gseguin: well nightlies will do it for sure
[13:21:41] <johnbender> see the `else if` in the php file I linked you
[13:21:52] <johnbender> gseguin: oh you mean just the docs themselves
[13:21:55] <johnbender> not the package
[13:22:19] <johnbender> the php file does a `git pull` after changing the working dir to /test
[13:22:28] <johnbender> which keeps it up to date
[13:23:41] <rwaldron> can anyone direct me to a "changelog" or similar (sorry I'm a pain in the ass tofay)
[13:23:43] <rwaldron> today*
[13:23:54] <johnbender> rwaldron: for?
[13:23:59] <johnbender> rwaldron: current 1.1?
[13:24:09] <rwaldron> is that what's in master?
[13:24:10] <johnbender> either way we don't really keep one running
[13:24:15] <johnbender> rwaldron: yah master is 1.1
[13:24:18] <rwaldron> word
[13:24:35] <rwaldron> hm
[13:24:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: just sort of throws a blerg post together and fills in the gaps with stories about his weekend
[13:24:51] <rwaldron> got it
[13:24:58] <rwaldron> I need to figure out where I can learn about things
[13:25:00] <rwaldron> such as...
[13:25:09] <rwaldron> loading message?
[13:25:22] <johnbender> docs?
[13:25:32] <rwaldron> smart ass
[13:25:39] <rwaldron> :)
[13:25:43] <johnbender> sorry, I just don't know what you mean
[13:25:55] <johnbender> do you mean the ways that the loading message was changed from 1.0?
[13:26:09] <johnbender> or just how it works and how it can be configured
[13:26:19] <rwaldron> the application I've been developing had a class the overrides jquery mobile's styles on the loading message
[13:26:31] <johnbender> ah
[13:26:44] <rwaldron> for some reason, that no longer works
[13:26:55] <johnbender> rwaldron: `git log -p` on some of the structure css is probably your only hop
[13:26:59] <johnbender> *hope
[13:27:11] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_ ^
[13:27:12] <rwaldron> intead i get this hideous thing that looks like it's from dr. mario
[13:27:18] <johnbender> unless they can tell you
[13:27:40] <rwaldron> i get fade in transitions where i had slide in
[13:27:59] <rwaldron> which isnt bad
[13:28:02] <johnbender> rwaldron: that's the default now on certain devices
[13:28:03] <rwaldron> it's actually kind of nice
[13:28:06] <johnbender> that was in the blog post
[13:28:10] <rwaldron> ok, cool
[13:28:12] <rwaldron> i kind of like this
[13:28:21] <rwaldron> i'll sell the client on why it's awesome
[13:28:22] <johnbender> yah who needs a changelog when you have me :D
[13:28:31] <rwaldron> as long as I'm not annoying you
[13:28:34] <gseguin> hey eddiemonge, the man I need to talk to
[13:28:38] <johnbender> rwaldron: you change it back if you like
[13:28:42] <gseguin> do you have time now?
[13:28:43] <johnbender> rwaldron: not at all
[13:28:58] <johnbender> gseguin: was I not able to answer your question?
[13:29:03] <johnbender> you didn't respond to my vommit
[13:29:11] <gseguin> johnbender: some of it
[13:29:14] * johnbender wants to answer gseguins question
[13:29:25] * johnbender strains to get his hand higher in the air
[13:29:25] <rwaldron> button styles are out of hand
[13:29:30] <gseguin> now I need to know where do I output the compiled docs
[13:29:34] <rwaldron> i had a button that was a nice size.
[13:29:40] <rwaldron> now it's effing huge
[13:29:41] <gseguin> so it gets picked up by /test
[13:29:55] <johnbender> gseguin: the compiled docs?
[13:29:58] <rwaldron> like some ruby on rails developer beat on it with css
[13:30:05] <johnbender> gseguin: do you mean the compiled js/css?
[13:30:17] <johnbender> rwaldron: aww, rails devs can be good
[13:30:29] <rwaldron> they love padding in their buttons
[13:30:31] <johnbender> you php bigots are all the same
[13:30:33] <rwaldron> web 2.0 d00d
[13:30:36] <rwaldron> php?
[13:30:37] <johnbender> lol
[13:30:38] <rwaldron> ew
[13:30:39] <johnbender> true true
[13:30:43] <gseguin> johnbender: yes
[13:30:58] <eddiemonge> gseguin: yeah, whats up?
[13:31:22] <gseguin> what r.js does when compiling the whole project is copy all files to a dest dir and compiling them
[13:31:37] <johnbender> gseguin: the output dir, so the compiled dir eh?
[13:31:44] <gseguin> so jquery.mobile.js in the compiled version will contain all the micro modules concatenated
[13:32:02] <gseguin> yeah however you want to name it
[13:32:10] <johnbender> gseguin: eddiemonge might have to correct me here but latest deploys to the cdn from /test/compiled
[13:32:31] <gseguin> but basically I need /test to point to that directory rather than the root of the workspace
[13:32:50] <johnbender> you mean the script include tags?
[13:33:11] <gseguin> no no the actual /test path on jquerymobile.com
[13:33:34] <johnbender> now I'm confused
[13:33:37] <gseguin> it needs to point at a different directory than the root of the workspace
[13:33:46] <gseguin> ok
[13:33:52] <gseguin> lets start over
[13:33:57] <eddiemonge> wjo right
[13:34:12] <eddiemonge> *right that latest deploys to cdn
[13:34:25] <gseguin> that post commit hook fetch and checks out the repo
[13:34:41] <gseguin>  /test points at the checked out repo
[13:34:48] <gseguin> am I right?
[13:35:17] <eddiemonge> right
[13:35:50] <gseguin> so we need /test to point at say... repo/built or something in the like
[13:36:19] <eddiemonge> i think the problem is semantics and locations actually
[13:36:35] <johnbender> ah, you're building a static version of the docs for /test
[13:36:42] <gseguin> yes
[13:36:42] <johnbender> that makes things much more clear
[13:36:45] <johnbender> now all the pieces fit
[13:37:02] <eddiemonge>  /test should be a straight checkout wheres cdn/mobile/latest/demos should be the compiled version
[13:37:07] <johnbender> gseguin: that requires something of an overhall to the postcommit hook and the makefile
[13:37:36] <gseguin> not really, just adding a dependency on latest
[13:37:42] <johnbender> *overhaul
[13:37:43] <eddiemonge> so looking at /test should be to look at the raw files, not the finished product
[13:38:12] <eddiemonge> and cdn/latest should be a working example of what the porduct will look like
[13:38:29] <gseguin> eddiemonge: you still won't get the finished product as js won't be processed or minified nor will CSS be minified
[13:38:49] <Wilto> oh god what is happening
[13:38:49] <gseguin> just concatenated to avoid the zillion HTTP requests we're currently generating
[13:38:58] <Wilto> everything is broken what have I done WHAT HAVE I DONE
[13:39:06] <gseguin> Wilto: I need help convincing these guys
[13:39:55] <Wilto> I AGREE OR MAYBE DISAGREE
[13:40:10] <Wilto> I’ve been completely tuned-out—what’s the rumpus?
[13:40:12] <gseguin> eddiemonge: we can't have /test pointing at the dev env
[13:40:18] <eddiemonge> cdn/latest has the minified and unminified files
[13:40:28] <gseguin> yes and that won't change
[13:40:39] <eddiemonge>  /test is a dev env though
[13:40:39] <gseguin> we need /test to perform better
[13:40:58] <Wilto> On that I agree.
[13:41:22] <Wilto>  /test is too public to be considered strictly a dev environment.
[13:41:33] <gseguin> the only way to achieve that is to concatenate the AMD modules into one jquery.mobile.js bundle
[13:41:58] <Wilto> I envision a lot of “this seemed slow, so I checked test and it seemed even slower” issues showing up.
[13:42:05] <gseguin> you can have a /dev pointing at the micro module version
[13:42:06] <eddiemonge>  /test should be a reflection of what users have on their own local checkouts
[13:42:28] <Wilto> I mean, ideally, I’d like to see that sped up a little.
[13:42:29] <eddiemonge> actually ...... /test shouldnt even really exist
[13:42:34] <gseguin> I disagree
[13:42:50] <gseguin>  /test is to show the users the state of master
[13:43:13] <eddiemonge> if someone wants to see what the jquery mobile looks like, they can view the /demos pages. if they thats what cdn/latest should be for
[13:43:27] <eddiemonge> it should be faster anyway
[13:43:51] <gseguin> demos doesn't point at master
[13:43:51] <eddiemonge> since its a cdn vs a slower shared machine
[13:44:02] <eddiemonge> no but it points at stable
[13:44:30] <toddmparker_> but is there a /latest/ demo?
[13:44:43] <toddmparker_> point is google points to /test/ and now it's sloooooow
[13:44:43] <johnbender> no, latest redirects to your blog posts :(
[13:44:49] <toddmparker_> heh
[13:44:58] <toddmparker_> i know we have latest css and js
[13:45:07] <eddiemonge> there used to be a cdn/latest/demo
[13:45:18] <toddmparker_> but we need to have a view of master that is realistic to what production will be
[13:45:31] <eddiemonge> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos – The demo pages using this date’s build
[13:45:45] <toddmparker_> i don't need date X, I need now
[13:45:50] <eddiemonge> somewhere that demos folder got dropped
[13:46:00] <toddmparker_> most times I use test is to review a recent commit
[13:46:25] <eddiemonge> which is also reflected on cdn/latest
[13:46:25] <toddmparker_> since /test/ used to work a certain way, i think it should go back to that state
[13:46:38] <toddmparker_> i.e. concat files, minified
[13:47:33] <gseguin> I wouldn't minify though
[13:47:33] <eddiemonge> then at that point /test becomes a mirror of cdn/latest
[13:47:46] <sven_franck> kinblas: hey
[13:47:50] <eddiemonge> and mirroring a cdn is silly
[13:48:08] <Wilto> I’m cool with that, actually.
[13:48:18] <Wilto> Considering how many links to test are floating around in the wild.
[13:48:36] <Wilto> Granted they are disclaimed with everything down to the “test” in the URL, but still.
[13:49:03] <Wilto> Those links are floating around out there, having it working so slowly is Not Ideal™.
[13:50:20] <eddiemonge> we could redirect jqm.com/test/ to cdn/mobile/latest/demo
[13:51:39] <Wilto> I think that’s fine, honestly. As long as it mirrors the latest code, I’m okay with the delivery being different for the sake of 1) being quicker and 2) saving a little face.
[13:52:51] <Wilto> Thoughts, other jQM folk?
[13:52:51] <eddiemonge> id prefer doing the redirection because
[13:53:00] <eddiemonge> 1) saves another build process on the server
[13:53:08] <Wilto> (Or “jQuery Brobles,” as I have just now decided to call you all.)
[13:53:13] <eddiemonge> 2) will serve things faster than jqm .com will
[13:53:39] <eddiemonge> 3) gives a more semantic name as /test/ has always bothered me since its not actually a test
[13:53:54] <eddiemonge> 4) takes more load off the jqm .com server
[13:55:30] <eddiemonge> arguments?
[13:55:31] <gseguin> sure whatever works, we still need an extra build step to not have the docs use the micro modules
[13:55:46] <johnbender> my alternate proposal is
[13:55:54] <johnbender> 1) build and replace jquery.mobile.docs
[13:56:09] <johnbender> 2) add a git checkout to the /test dir repo before the pull
[13:56:29] <gseguin> 1 should include build for the css as well
[13:56:44] <johnbender> gseguin: that's fine
[13:56:54] <johnbender> 1) BUILD ALL THE THINGS
[13:57:07] <johnbender> 2) Add `git checkout .; git pull`
[13:57:11] <johnbender> 3) profit?
[13:57:55] <johnbender> everyone goes silent on my porposal
[13:57:58] <johnbender> is it that bad??
[13:58:01] <eddiemonge> im confused by it
[13:58:18] <Wilto> wait johnbender build how many of the things
[13:58:24] <johnbender> eddiemonge: we just replace jquery.mobile.docs.js with the built version
[13:58:34] <johnbender> in the latest target
[13:58:52] <johnbender> the only problem with that is the subsequent pull since we've altered files in the repo
[13:58:59] <eddiemonge> yeah
[13:59:00] <johnbender> so `git checkout .`
[13:59:06] <johnbender> and then git pull
[14:00:02] * johnbender imagines everyone on the team facepalming at their desks
[14:00:15] <gseguin> I'm testing
[14:00:21] <eddiemonge> itll still be slower
[14:00:22] <gseguin> to validate it
[14:00:30] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[14:00:33] <eddiemonge> its a valid strategy, more or less
[14:00:34] <johnbender> I'm going to finish my preso
[14:00:38] <Wilto> I make pictures in Photoshop, and then I make those pictures go on the internet. Sometimes they move around!
[14:00:41] <toddmparker_> sorry guys in a meeting and no wi have to head out
[14:00:54] <toddmparker_> i trust you'll come up with somethign super smart
[14:01:51] <eddiemonge> johnbender: i can see a rare race condition occurring if two commits are pushed at the same time or extremely close.
[14:05:18] <gseguin> johnbender's solution would work
[14:06:54] <johnbender> eddiemonge: aren't the web hooks rate limited on the github side?
[14:07:00] <gseguin> but we need to checkout everytime to blow away the changes before building jquery.mobile.docs.js and jquery.mobile.css
[14:07:06] <eddiemonge> not that i know of
[14:07:06] <johnbender> that is, they shouldn't be bombarding your server
[14:07:33] <eddiemonge> and 2 pings certainly wouldnt hit that limit
[14:07:50] <eddiemonge> git checkout -- .
[14:07:57] <Wilto> So, as a dude who puts borders on things for a living, where are we at?
[14:08:11] <toddmparker_> my only hope is that /test/ feels like it used to because 99.9% of the time it's used to preview stuff or do device testing so I don't care about line numbers and seeing individual JS files, iI just want it to feel as fast and realistic to what the next official release will be.
[14:08:26] <gseguin> whatever you guys want to do just let me know
[14:08:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah it'll be just one file again
[14:08:43] <toddmparker_> i just picture someone feeling how show this is so they pop open web inspector and tweet "jQuery Mobile is so slow and it's 600k"
[14:08:46] <Wilto> Yeah, that’s cool.
[14:08:51] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[14:08:54] <johnbender> gseguin: I say we go with the dumb simple solution because the worst case is that it ends up loading the modules
[14:08:54] <toddmparker_> thanks!
[14:09:09] <toddmparker_> i like dumb. we're friends
[14:09:20] <Wilto> I was just saying to Todd: I can’t see a situation where we need to get a line number of an error from test, and we can’t get it from our repo.
[14:09:32] <Wilto> I mean, if that’s the case, it ain’t something we can fix in our repo.
[14:09:46] <johnbender> "Perfection is often the enemy of the Good"
[14:09:50] <johnbender> err
[14:10:00] <Wilto> “Things should be as simple as they are, but no simpler?”
[14:10:03] <johnbender> "The Perfect is often the enemy of The Good"
[14:10:11] <eddiemonge> dumb simple solution would be to add docs to the latest required target and then "Alias /test http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/docs"
[14:10:41] <eddiemonge> less coding too
[14:11:01] <eddiemonge> 5 letters added to the repo and one sentence added to the server
[14:11:16] <eddiemonge> and would give the faster loading possible
[14:11:42] <gseguin> except the docs target doesn't build the docs bundle but that's a different story
[14:11:55] <eddiemonge> it doesnt?
[14:12:07] <gseguin> oh yeah sorry it does
[14:12:17] <gseguin> I mean it's like a production build
[14:12:21] <gseguin> that's fine with me
[14:12:58] <gseguin> like I said whatever you want to do, but it has to be done today
[14:13:36] <eddiemonge> i could have this solution done in two minutes from go
[14:13:44] <gseguin> johnbender: ?
[14:14:00] * johnbender sighs
[14:14:16] <johnbender> what is the docs folder exactly?
[14:14:27] <johnbender> in this case
[14:14:35] <eddiemonge> the docs folder
[14:14:42] <johnbender>  http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/docs
[14:15:02] <johnbender> sans the index?
[14:15:06] <eddiemonge> sorry, it would actually be /demos on that
[14:15:16] <eddiemonge> exactly what is at http://jquerymobile.com/test/ now
[14:15:31] <gseguin> so it doesnt pick up the index.html from the root?
[14:15:35] <gseguin> or does it?
[14:15:43] <Wilto> kinblas: You around?
[14:15:55] <johnbender> eddiemonge: so we'd just copy this stuff out that folder?
[14:15:58] <gseguin> oh yeah looking at the target it copies it
[14:16:09] <kinblas> Wilto: yeah, just got out of a meeting
[14:16:15] <kinblas> Whassup?
[14:16:26] <Wilto> You said you weren’t seeing that 2.1 back button issue?
[14:16:31] <Wilto> Android 2.1. Naturally.
[14:16:39] <eddiemonge> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0/demos/
[14:17:00] <kinblas> Wilto: nope not with /test/ anyways
[14:17:01] <eddiemonge> is what itd be except with sed/1\.0/latest/
[14:17:12] <kinblas> Wilto: it always went back to the right pages
[14:17:23] <Wilto> kinblas: You weren’t testing on the transition demo pages, were you?
[14:17:38] <Wilto> I can’t reproduce it on the transitions page, but I can elsewhere. Which… Is weird.
[14:17:49] <gseguin> eddiemonge: can you redirect /test to that ?
[14:17:50] <kinblas> Wilto: Nope, started from main page and navigated into su-pages from there, being careful not to load any rel-external pages
[14:18:02] <eddiemonge> gseguin: to what?
[14:18:08] <kinblas> Wilto: If you give me the sequence of pages you are trying I can do the same
[14:18:20] <kinblas> Wilto: and you are pressing the hardware back button?
[14:18:22] <Wilto> I’m seeing it everywhere… You’d have run into it.
[14:18:23] <gseguin> to code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos
[14:18:24] <Wilto> Yep.
[14:19:04] <eddiemonge> gseguin: yeah. thats whatd i do
[14:19:06] <Wilto> What version of 2.1 you got going there?
[14:19:13] <Wilto> “2.1-update1” here.
[14:19:17] <kinblas> Wilto: ditto
[14:19:22] <Wilto> What the hell.
[14:19:24] <gseguin> k
[14:19:24] <kinblas> Wilto: I'm using a Droid-X
[14:19:26] <johnbender> gseguin: eddiemonge: I have to get this preso done, it'd be better to not do the checkout so if that works go for it
[14:19:34] <Wilto> HTC Aria.
[14:19:50] <kinblas> Wilto: funny how folks are having problems on HTC devices
[14:19:55] <kinblas> makes you go hmmmm
[14:19:58] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3426
[14:19:59] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (17.303s ago): add docs back to the latest build target
[14:20:01] <gseguin> no problem johnbender
[14:20:11] <Wilto> kinblas: Funny in a “crying myself to sleep” kinda way.
[14:20:28] <kinblas> Wilto: lol ... so give me a sample page sequence and I'll try it out
[14:21:11] <gseguin> oh wait that wont work eddiemonge
[14:21:29] <gseguin> because the docs are using requirejs
[14:22:16] <gseguin> let me add the right build steps for docs
[14:22:17] <eddiemonge> the requirejs part is getting stripped out with the "docs" target build?
[14:22:27] <gseguin> nope
[14:22:44] <Wilto> kinblas: Pages & Dialogs -> Linking Pages
[14:22:48] <kinblas> Wilto: just tested 3 times .. example: Main > Buttons > Inline Buttons > Back > Back
[14:22:50] <Wilto> Then hit the hardware back button.
[14:22:52] <eddiemonge> hmm that means they would be broke on an actual deploy then right?
[14:22:52] <gseguin> does it?
[14:23:20] <kinblas> Wilto: worked for me?
[14:23:38] <Wilto> Jumps me down the page a handful of pixels, updates the URL, then goes nowhere.
[14:24:12] <Wilto> …But never cleans up the URL.
[14:24:14] <eddiemonge> gseguin: this would/should/need to be updated then as well: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/Makefile#L90
[14:24:27] <kinblas> Wilto: I see that jumping behavior
[14:24:34] <kinblas> but the page always corrects
[14:24:36] <gseguin> yeah that's what I'm doing eddiemonge
[14:24:36] <Wilto> Which is what I was seeing when the fallback transitions would break, but this predates the new transition stuff.
[14:25:08] <kinblas> Wilto: What it looks like is the document is being scrolled to the previous page's offset, though the screen hasn't updated
[14:25:40] <Wilto> …Huh.
[14:25:42] <kinblas> Wilto: it goes like this
[14:25:54] <kinblas> Wilto: Scroll > Fade > New Page Scroll
[14:26:11] <kinblas> Scroll > Fade Out > Fade In > Scroll
[14:26:21] <eddiemonge> gseguin johnbender toddmparker_ so this is how it would work potentially: jquerymobile.com/testing/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[14:26:34] <eddiemonge> except testing would be test and 1.0 would be latest
[14:27:18] <Wilto> So this is, like… Scroll > New Page Scroll [on the original page]?
[14:27:33] <eddiemonge> brb in 10 minutes or so
[14:27:33] <kinblas> Wilto: what it looks like to me  is when you hit back ... the browser is auto-jumping to the previous scroll offset, we then scroll to zero, fade out, fade in new page, then scroll to previous position
[14:28:07] <kinblas> Wilto: I think the browser is restoring the scroll offset of the previous URL
[14:28:33] <kinblas> in any case, the pages all end up correct
[14:28:41] <kinblas> so I'm not seeing that problem where the URL and page don't match
[14:29:58] <Wilto> I sure am.
[14:30:02] <Wilto> Ugh.
[14:30:04] <Wilto> So… Hm.
[14:30:27] <kinblas> Wilto: so I think what we need to do is create a test document
[14:30:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/DyI8tA
[14:30:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #2553 — Addresses issue where underlying checkboxes/radio buttons were not being updated when enhanced buttons were clicked. - Mat Marquis
[14:31:02] <kinblas> that throws an alert or something when a hashchange is received
[14:31:06] <Wilto> Make a note: there’s my official One Thing I Got Done of the Day.
[14:31:12] <kinblas> see if it fails to happen
[14:31:25] <Wilto> It’s alert time, you’re saying.
[14:31:36] <kinblas> yeah
[14:31:50] <Wilto> We do what we must.
[14:31:52] <kinblas> Wilto: anyways, that extra scroll is a bit worrisome
[14:32:06] <Wilto> Yeah… I mean, at least something is consistently amiss.
[14:32:25] <Wilto> Did someone say they had an Android emulator running, earlier?
[14:32:35] <Wilto> A tiebreaker might set me a little more at-ease.
[14:32:42] <kinblas> Wilto: I have one, let me fire it up and see if I can repro there
[14:32:50] <Wilto> Oh,nice.
[14:32:51] <Wilto> Thanks.
[14:33:20] <Wilto> Meantime, I’m throwing alerts around with reckless abandon, since I can reproduce pretty consistently.
[14:33:55] <kinblas> Wilto: it's always fun to fire up the emulator
[14:34:06] <Wilto> See you in a couple of hours!
[14:34:09] <kinblas> I like to play that game of counting the number of seconds that go by between keystrokes
[14:34:18] <Wilto> That thing is nightmarish.
[14:34:36] <Wilto> I would rather go to Radio Shack and build a phone from scratch than use that thing.
[14:34:41] <kinblas> lol
[14:39:14] <Wilto> …Hashchange isn’t firing.
[14:39:28] <kinblas> Wilto: figures
[14:39:34] <kinblas> it had to be that
[14:39:43] <Wilto> ¡Fantastiço!
[14:40:25] <kinblas> Wilto: so it works in the emulator
[14:40:34] <kinblas> funny it's so slow you get 100% framerate drop
[14:40:43] <Wilto> DAMMIT, BEN ALMAN
[14:40:46] <kinblas> Wilto: I see that same pre-scroll
[14:40:55] <kinblas> but the pages are always correct at the end
[14:41:08] <kinblas> Wilto: Are you pressing the back button rapidly to go back 2 steps?
[14:41:11] <johnbender> kinblas: does 2.1 report it as supported?
[14:41:18] <kinblas> Or just click, wait, click, wait?
[14:41:18] <Wilto> Nope.
[14:41:23] <Wilto> Click, wait, click, wait.
[14:41:31] <Wilto> I’ve tried messing with the timing just in case.
[14:41:33] <kinblas> Wilto: report what?
[14:41:46] <Wilto> johnbender: Go do your presentation, man!
[14:41:48] <johnbender> kinblas: report support for the hashchange event
[14:42:04] <johnbender> Wilto: sorry man, I just added this picture to it and I need to take a break http://www.actionfigureinsider.com/main/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Dino-Megazord.jpg
[14:42:10] * johnbender is not joking
[14:42:12] <Wilto> so sweet
[14:42:35] <Wilto> I used http://bukk.it/lovecats.jpg in reference to HTML5 and RWD being BFFs.
[14:42:40] <Wilto> I get it, man.
[14:43:53] <kinblas> johnbender: bah, this tool is broken http://jquerymobile.com/test/tools/config-props.html

[14:45:48] <johnbender> kinblas: what?
[14:45:53] <johnbender> should work just like it did before
[14:46:13] <kinblas> johnbender: I just tried loading http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/
[14:46:17] <johnbender> kinblas: unless they removed index.php
[14:46:23] <kinblas> they who?
[14:46:28] <johnbender> those otheres
[14:46:31] <johnbender> lol
[14:46:31] <kinblas> lol
[14:46:40] <johnbender> gdamnit
[14:46:46] <johnbender> gseguin: who took out index.php
[14:46:47] <kinblas> those that are returning to working for their companies tomorrow?
[14:46:48] <johnbender> lol we need that
[14:46:49] <kinblas> :-D
[14:47:10] <Wilto> I took out AN index.php.
[14:47:20] <johnbender> js/index.php
[14:47:24] <kinblas> Wilto: DAMNIT WILTO
[14:47:28] <johnbender> we need that for when people want to test without the amd
[14:47:30] <Wilto> NOOO
[14:47:59] <johnbender> s/the amd/amd/

[14:48:39] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #403 on jquery-mobile, reported by ai (1y, 2m ago): AJAX back button support on Android 2.1 is flaky
[14:48:44] <Wilto> My bad, guys.
[14:49:12] <johnbender> Wilto: no worries, what was the reason?
[14:49:41] <Wilto> Oh, wait, I think I only scrapped the CSS one.
[14:49:49] <Wilto> Which is no big, given the new @import scheme.
[14:49:54] <Wilto> Six of one, half a dozen there.
[14:50:24] <kinblas> Wilto: but there are files in the repository that include css/themes/default/
[14:50:25] <kinblas> ??
[14:50:28] <kinblas> does that still work?
[14:51:08] <Wilto> We now point to jquery.mobile.css, which imports the theme/structure files.
[14:52:32] <Wilto> …Looking at the original issue for the 2.1 hashchange dealie (linked above), the reporter was also using an HTC.
[14:52:32] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah it was removed here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/9e935c31f628026d372605397129f731b75a5ec0
[14:52:34] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by gseguin (4h, 55m ago): Merge branch 'out-in-transition'Conflicts:	css/structure/index.php	docs/_assets/js/jqm-docs.js	index.html
[14:52:36] <Wilto> …I wonder.
[14:52:41] <johnbender> kinblas: how did you find that?
[14:52:45] <johnbender> manual?
[14:52:52] <kinblas> johnbender: manually clicking in commits list
[14:53:04] <johnbender> fair enough
[14:53:07] <johnbender> thanks for doing the hard work
[14:53:29] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin can I haz my js/index.php back?
[14:53:29] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[14:53:38] <kinblas> Wilto: anyways, that tool that is broken, does a dump of the .support and config options so you can see what the values are
[14:54:23] <kinblas> Wilto: johnbender: I'm pretty sure hashchange is supported on 2.1 otherwise things would be pretty broken and transitions wouldn't work
[14:54:39] <kinblas> well not broken, just transitions woudn't work
[14:54:41] <kinblas> but they do
[14:54:46] <johnbender> kinblas: I mean more that it's supported without poling
[14:54:57] <kinblas> oh natively supported
[14:55:01] <johnbender> "polling"
[14:55:11] <johnbender> k
[14:55:15] <johnbender> that sucks
[14:55:21] <kinblas> johnbender: you mean the hashchange plugin doesn't kick in
[14:55:23] <johnbender> gotta love broken ass implementations
[14:55:27] <johnbender> kinblas: yah
[14:55:32] <kinblas> yeah that I'm not sure about
[14:55:35] <johnbender> that obviously makes a big difference
[14:55:41] <kinblas> that's why we need to pring the support
[14:55:43] <kinblas> so we can tell?
[14:55:57] <kinblas> johnbender: do you know how to bring a file back?
[14:56:07] <johnbender> kinblas: nope
[14:56:17] <johnbender> I can hit google once I finish this
[14:56:35] <johnbender> at this rate I won't have time to do my 100 proofreadthroughs
[14:57:28] <kinblas> johnbender: ew ... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3150394/how-to-undelete-a-file-previously-deleted-in-gits-history
[14:57:38] <johnbender> lawl
[14:57:52] <kinblas> all I'll say is I aint doin' it
[14:57:53] <kinblas> :-)
[14:58:17] <johnbender> git checkout commit; cp file ../; git checkout master; cp ../file .
[14:58:18] <johnbender> imo
[14:58:48] <Wilto> I would, uh, probably just reset to where it existed, grab the file contents and hide ’em somewhere, then go back from whence I came and add the file.
[14:59:24] <Wilto> I’m still, like, half a step above the people who pick up their mouse between pushes when it comes to git.
[14:59:59] * gseguin catches up
[15:02:11] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah bring back js/index.php if you'd like
[15:02:12] <bot-t> (8 mins 42 secs ago) <johnbender> tell gseguin can I haz my js/index.php back?
[15:02:21] <eddiemonge> so 10 minutes turned into 30. oops
[15:02:31] <gseguin> thanks bot-t, very useful
[15:02:39] <johnbender> lol
[15:02:50] <johnbender> kinblas: copy away if you like my friend
[15:02:58] <gseguin> eddiemonge: same here no worries
[15:04:26] <eddiemonge> whatd i miss? anything?
[15:04:50] <eddiemonge> johnbender: did you understand that test link i posted?
[15:07:27] <kinblas> johnbender: FYI the hashchange support is determined and stored in a private variable in the hashchange plugin
[15:07:33] <johnbender> eddiemonge: nope
[15:07:38] <johnbender> kinblas: hmm that's odd
[15:07:46] <johnbender> eddiemonge: not sure what link you mean either
[15:09:03] <eddiemonge> my proposed solution would be like: http://jquerymobile.com/testing  (/test in real case, and the final destination would be /latest instead of 1.0)
[15:09:51] <Wilto> I want _one thing_ to actually be a “quick fix.” Just one. Ever. This is my dream.
[15:10:09] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'll let you take it up wih gseguin I don't even understand the strategy you guys have undertaken
[15:10:12] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[15:10:38] <gseguin> yup not a problem I think I understand what Eddie wants to do
[15:10:47] <gseguin> I'm rewriting the docs target
[15:10:54] <kinblas> gseguin: you see the note about restoring js/index.php?
[15:11:20] <eddiemonge>  /test effectively goes away. hitting it will redirect to the cdn demo page which gseguin is working on to be able to sed out the links to the js/css
[15:11:34] <gseguin> kinblas: yup I said go ahead although I wouldn't keep it around too long to not have to maintain it
[15:11:41] <johnbender> alright
[15:12:06] <johnbender> that was what I was originally saying with regards to pretty much every other solution is that it would require a script tag replace
[15:12:14] <johnbender> carry on!
[15:12:30] <kinblas> johnbender: ok, I can update the script tag to? jquery.mobile.js?
[15:12:34] <eddiemonge> its a bug that cdn/latest didnt have a /demos folder anymore
[15:13:04] <johnbender> kinblas: we need to get index.php back anyhow
[15:13:08] <johnbender> kinblas: but it's up to you
[15:13:16] <eddiemonge> fixing that bug lets us get rid of /test and deliver the best possible experience when using /test
[15:14:15] <kinblas> johnbender: I just want stuff to work :-) I haven't been paying attention too much to what you guys are doing with the AMD stuff to know what the recommended approach is
[15:15:35] <eddiemonge> Wilto said he was going to deliever every file on their own CD with 50 hours free
[15:22:32] <gseguin> eddiemonge: where the tests included in the docs zip on purpose?
[15:25:01] <eddiemonge> yeah
[15:25:05] <eddiemonge> oh shoot
[15:25:15] <gseguin> same for tools?
[15:25:16] <eddiemonge> johnbender: are you still using the .php test stuff?
[15:25:42] <eddiemonge> gseguin: i think might answer should have been "do they need to be?"
[15:25:54] <eddiemonge> thats the one downside of using the cdn, no php
[15:26:02] <eddiemonge> so that might kill all of this
[15:26:21] <gseguin> say what?
[15:26:56] <gseguin> I can remove them from the docs bundle easily
[15:27:16] <gseguin> I'll do a first checkin
[15:27:40] <Wilto> Does Require.js introduce any new and exciting caching issues I should know about before this Android 2.3 gets defenestrated?
[15:28:35] <gseguin> not anymore than previous caching issues
[15:28:42] <Wilto> Out the window it goes.
[15:28:47] <gseguin> except it's on a lot more files
[15:29:14] <gseguin> noooooooooooooooooo
[15:30:30] <Wilto> This is insane. If I knock out entire files, it won’t de-cache.
[15:30:59] <eddiemonge> what? where?
[15:31:07] <gseguin> jrburke: ^^ any idea if that could be due to RequireJS ?
[15:31:14] <Wilto> Locally.
[15:31:36] <Wilto> My desktop browsers are fine with it.
[15:33:46] <jrburke> gseguin: this is on an android device? are you running tests? not sure how the files are changed in your process, but in general requirejs does not introduce any new caching issues. however if you are using the text plugin or if you are loading things after initial page load, doing a shift reload is not enough, will need to clear cache first
[15:34:00] <jrburke> since the shift reload does not apply to things loaded after initial page load
[15:34:15] <jrburke> but it sounds like this is with an android phone?
[15:34:19] <Wilto> Yeah.
[15:34:56] <Wilto> I have to completely wipe out the cache.
[15:34:58] <gseguin> there, now you can defenestrate that phone Wilto
[15:35:00] <eddiemonge> for the rest of the platform being so awesome, the android browser sure does seem like it sucks a lot
[15:35:06] <Wilto> OUT IT GOES
[15:35:12] <Wilto> eddiemonge: YYYYY
[15:36:39] <eddiemonge> ?????
[15:36:52] <Wilto> That’s a lot of emphatic yesses.
[15:37:19] <Wilto> Also: Android 2.3 does support the `perspective` property.
[15:37:21] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/DcZVdg
[15:37:21] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Rewrote "docs" target to take advantage of r.js' whole project optimization added build profile docs.build.js - Ghislain Seguin
[15:37:21] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Don't know why that r.js was there in the first place - Ghislain Seguin
[15:37:30] <gseguin> eddiemonge: it's in your hands now
[15:37:46] <Wilto> Not 3D, mind you. It can’t USE `perspective`.
[15:37:53] <Wilto> But it sure has it. So. There goes that test.
[15:38:25] <eddiemonge> gseguin: can you pull in my latest change?
[15:39:09] <gseguin> 3426 ?
[15:39:22] <eddiemonge> yeah
[15:39:35] <gseguin> BOOM
[15:39:41] <eddiemonge> its a huge change. signicifcantly adds to the repo size
[15:39:46] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/GhwKNw
[15:39:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3426 from eddiemonge/patch-14 - Ghislain Seguin
[15:40:13] <gseguin> I know let me revert it to re-review it and call a vote on it
[15:46:42] <eddiemonge> uh oh
[15:52:50] <Wilto> Some evenings come closing time, it’s all I can do to keep from holding a phone at arm’s length then dropping it, like a microphone before one storms off stage.
[15:53:45] <eddiemonge> ignore the brief outage in jquerymobile.com. never happened
[15:55:52] <Wilto> I saw nothing.
[15:56:05] <eddiemonge> me neither. that was the problem 8D
[15:56:14] <Wilto> Ba-dum tss.
[15:56:34] <gseguin> ok so http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/demos/ seems to work
[15:56:44] <eddiemonge> yup
[15:56:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/xu1kgw
[15:56:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes a false positive for 3D transform support on Android 2.3 (possibly others). - Mat Marquis
[15:56:48] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Comment typo, made a TODO about globalizing the testing method added in the previous commit. - Mat Marquis
[15:56:55] <gseguin> I think I'm going to add the SHA comment in both css and js
[15:56:58] <eddiemonge> want to test it real quick and then i can redirect /test to it
[15:57:41] <eddiemonge> i was there was a way to speed up the build process. it seems to freaking slow right now
[15:57:54] <eddiemonge> i point the finger at java
[15:58:26] <gseguin> node
[15:58:33] <gseguin> that's the way to speed it up
[15:58:47] <eddiemonge> got a branch for that yet?
[15:59:00] <gseguin> huh?
[15:59:24] <gseguin> get nodeJS installed on the build machine and I'll switch those java to node calls
[15:59:38] <gseguin> and it'll go much faster
[15:59:58] <eddiemonge> can you do that in a branch for testing?
[16:00:15] <gseguin> sure
[16:00:25] <gseguin> give me few minutes
[16:00:36] <gseguin> I'm trying to add the version info
[16:00:47] <eddiemonge> no worries. that could wait til next week or whenever
[16:01:45] <gseguin> btw Wilto, toddmparker_, kinblas, johnbender: still no votes on the AMD thing :(
[16:08:00] <johnbender> -1 for node
[16:08:25] <johnbender> gseguin: arg thats right we need to decide something
[16:10:12] <johnbender> gseguin: docs + jquery dep was a go
[16:10:37] <gseguin> huh?
[16:11:16] <johnbender> gseguin: we need to document how to do a mobile init with the addition of the jquery dependency
[16:11:31] <gseguin> oh I see
[16:11:42] <gseguin> yes we do
[16:11:42] <johnbender> gseguin: honestly, can we just punt on removing the iife
[16:12:03] <johnbender> lol
[16:12:06] <johnbender> I realize that's lame
[16:12:44] <johnbender> but if we can't make a clear cut decision right now it just ends up being change for the sake of change
[16:13:14] <johnbender> I'm also tired
[16:13:22] <johnbender> :/
[16:13:24] <gseguin> ok so I'll bring up that wrapper
[16:13:41] <johnbender> bring up
[16:13:42] <johnbender> ?
[16:13:43] <gseguin> I mean I'll port it to master
[16:14:00] <johnbender> the one that lets us play nice with an existing loader?
[16:14:17] <gseguin> then the least I can do if we keep the IIFEs is strip them from their arguments
[16:14:35] <gseguin> and expresses our dep on jquery
[16:14:51] <johnbender> what do you mean strip them from their args?
[16:15:08] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/issue-3386/build/wrap.start
[16:16:23] <kinblas> johnbender: woah, something just flushed at originate ... got a jenkins build notice with a sh*load of checkins listed?
[16:16:34] <kinblas> johnbender: are builds still running there?
[16:16:40] <johnbender> kinblas: yah they might be
[16:16:56] <johnbender> kinblas: they actually contacted me about the hudson server too
[16:16:59] <johnbender> I'll ping them
[16:17:03] <kinblas> johnbender: nice chronicle of checkins
[16:17:29] <eddiemonge> is that something that comes from the jqm. com server?
[16:19:01] <johnbender> eddiemonge: the build emails?
[16:19:37] <johnbender> gseguin: if we're just going to leave it as is, why is it we need the wrapper?
[16:19:50] <johnbender> we've gone over this I think, but I'm still confused :(
[16:21:21] <gseguin> to do the mapping of $, window, document, undefined once for all our modules
[16:21:43] <gseguin> it would do that and replace the jquery.mobile.exports
[16:21:45] <eddiemonge> johnbender: whatever kinblas was talking about. i restarted apache and killed a couple of hung java processes as well
[16:21:46] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm saying we should punt on _all_ of that
[16:22:13] <johnbender> gseguin: everything except the jquery dep
[16:22:25] <gseguin> hmm
[16:22:28] <gseguin> ok
[16:22:51] <johnbender> gseguin: I think we should make the change at some point, but if we need to get something done lets get the critical thing done and come back to it
[16:23:27] <gseguin> oh I know
[16:23:35] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #388: STILL FAILING in 1 hr 10 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/388/
[16:23:35] <jqm-jenkins-bot> mat: Fixes #2553 — Addresses issue where underlying checkboxes/radio buttons were not being updated when enhanced buttons were clicked.
[16:23:54] <johnbender> Wilto: anyone had time to look at all the test failures from the transitions merge?
[16:23:58] <gseguin> as it is it's not a valid module because the code gets executed outside of the control of define
[16:24:11] <gseguin> if running in an amd env
[16:24:31] <johnbender> gseguin: you mean with exporting $.mobile
[16:24:37] <gseguin> that's what that wrapper provides
[16:24:40] <johnbender> right
[16:24:54] <gseguin> no I mean the execution
[16:24:59] <johnbender> I wish we would have just saved the 'were amd ready' anouncement
[16:25:15] <johnbender> gseguin: right but the only reason we even care is because we export a module
[16:25:20] <gseguin> no don't worry we're there
[16:25:23] <johnbender> otherwise this is just a build system
[16:25:30] <gseguin> yes
[16:25:35] * johnbender sighs
[16:25:43] <gseguin> but it's way cool to export ourselves as a module
[16:25:50] <johnbender> :/
[16:26:01] <johnbender> alright
[16:26:01] <gseguin> so the only thing is if running in an amd env
[16:26:11] <gseguin> our code may arrive before jquery
[16:26:26] <gseguin> so that's why we have to wrap
[16:26:36] <johnbender> awright
[16:26:48] <gseguin> so we get executed after jquery has been evaluated
[16:27:06] <johnbender> gseguin: bare minimum to be a amd loving citizen of the web
[16:27:11] <gseguin> does that make sense ?
[16:27:13] <johnbender> yes
[16:27:17] <johnbender> it definitely does
[16:27:17] <gseguin> exactly
[16:27:26] <johnbender> just wrap it and call it a day then
[16:27:35] <gseguin> sounds good
[16:27:48] <johnbender> gseguin: sorry to make you explain this crap like 30 times
[16:28:07] <gseguin> it helps me clarify my message
[16:28:38] <gseguin> no worries, it's not easy to explain and I'm far from making it easier to understand
[16:35:04] <gseguin> YES! just got the approval for JSConf
