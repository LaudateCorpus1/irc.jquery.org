[07:48:15] <scottjehl> mornin
[08:56:22] <toddparker> hey all
[08:56:30] <toddparker> working on docs finally
[08:56:33] <toddparker> have a template
[08:56:38] <toddparker> will push in a few
[08:56:42] <scottjehl> woo
[08:56:55] <scottjehl> <-- big fan of said template
[08:57:00] <toddparker> :)
[08:57:04] <gseguin> good morning
[08:57:10] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[09:24:14] <toddparker> hey all - just posted the new select docs format with API info layered in
[09:24:14] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/selects/index.html
[09:24:32] <toddparker> please flag any issues you see so we can clean this up as a template
[09:24:45] <toddparker> i want to ask people to contribute docs in this format
[09:25:26] <gseguin> Is it missing stylesheets or is it supposed to be plain?
[09:25:27] <toddparker> I also created a checklist for porting pages over to this format here
[09:25:28] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/API-docs:-How-to-guide
[09:25:35] <toddparker> try a refresh?
[09:25:46] <gseguin> same
[09:25:50] <toddparker> yikes
[09:25:52] <toddparker> see that
[09:27:05] <gseguin> let me send you a screenshot
[09:27:14] <toddparker> i see it
[09:27:19] <gseguin> oh ok
[09:27:20] <toddparker> path issue. thought i tested that
[09:27:23] <toddparker> sorry
[09:27:31] <gseguin> no problem
[09:29:28] <toddparker> pushing a fix
[09:29:35] <toddparker> CSS paths were wrong
[09:29:42] <gseguin> ok
[09:29:42] <toddparker> all these relative paths are a pain
[09:29:46] <toddparker> try now
[09:30:12] <gseguin> hmm still not
[09:33:21] <toddparker> try again. /test/ may not have synced
[09:33:21] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/selects/index.html
[09:33:40] <gseguin> much better
[09:35:41] <toddparker> give a shout if you have Q's, suggestions, see missing info, etc.
[09:35:50] <toddparker> i want to get this right
[09:35:54] <gseguin> I'll read through it
[09:36:08] <gseguin> need to deal with a couple stuff before
[09:36:24] <toddparker> select is odd b/c we're pulling custom menus out so i dindn't document those options
[09:36:30] <toddparker> sure, np
[09:49:42] <_nickel> toddparker: working on that now actually :D
[09:58:45] <scottjehl> _nickel - awesome
[09:58:47] <scottjehl> :)
[09:58:51] <toddparker> cool, thanks _nickel
[09:58:51] <scottjehl> next up: nested lists
[09:59:41] <toddparker> woo hoo
[09:59:58] <toddparker> so for today's call, we should figure out beta 2 timing
[10:00:09] <toddparker> this week is tough, so maybe monday/tuesday?
[10:53:28] <gseguin> toddparker: one remark (more on the code than the doc)
[10:53:44] <gseguin> There is an inconsistency in the way the attributes are cased
[10:54:04] <gseguin> iconpos and iconshadow versus nativeMenu
[10:54:22] <gseguin> I think it should be camelCase everywhere
[10:54:25] <scottjehl> I'd say those are bugs in the code
[10:54:32] <scottjehl> there's a big ripple there
[10:54:37] <gseguin> yeah yeah agreed
[10:54:45] <scottjehl> iconpos translates to data-iconpos
[10:54:53] <gseguin> it just became obvious through the doc
[10:54:56] <scottjehl> whereas iconPos becomes data-icon-pos
[10:55:16] <gseguin> oh
[10:56:18] <toddparker> camel case in js = dash delimited in html
[10:56:34] <scottjehl> right. widget factory automates that
[10:56:50] <scottjehl> anyway, I agree we have inconsistencies. they're breaking changes though
[11:01:27] <gseguin> meeting?
[11:03:09] <gseguin> _nickel: meeting on #jquery-meeting ?
[11:50:52] <_nickel>  gseguin: scottjehl: toddparker: sorry guys got caught talking with the HR lady from Adobe :(
[11:52:29] <scottjehl> no probs
[11:52:30] <scottjehl> how goes?
[11:52:35] <gseguin> That'll be one beer for each one of us ;)
[11:52:37] <_nickel> scottjehl: one sec
[11:54:10] <_nickel> scottjehl: well
[11:54:29] <_nickel> working on the select seperation
[11:54:36] <scottjehl> ah nice
[11:54:39] <_nickel> trying to do it in refactoring steps
[11:54:41] <_nickel> bit by bit
[11:54:41] <scottjehl> so that branch is ready?
[11:54:52] <scottjehl> dom cache
[11:55:00] <_nickel> I think it is
[11:55:05] <scottjehl> k. we can test
[11:55:24] <_nickel> awesome
[11:57:10] <scottjehl> nice. ppl will love that one
[11:58:38] <toddparker> sweet, thanks _nickel
[11:59:02] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: np
[11:59:07] <_nickel> yikes hectic day
[11:59:28] <toddparker> did you re-name this?
[11:59:29] <scottjehl> hey so before we land this branch
[11:59:30] <scottjehl> naming
[11:59:32] <_nickel> and I was up late last night with the munchkin
[11:59:36] <scottjehl> jinx
[11:59:38] <_nickel> ah!
[11:59:39] <_nickel> lol
[11:59:42] <_nickel> hrm
[12:00:23] <_nickel> I was trying to think of some alterante to cache so we could just do "data-<something>"
[12:01:03] <toddparker> dom-cache
[12:01:09] <_nickel> data-retain, data-hold
[12:01:12] <scottjehl> so, just cache is misleading
[12:01:18] <scottjehl> ooh I like all those
[12:01:26] <toddparker> store
[12:01:32] <_nickel> consulting thesaurus
[12:01:38] <toddparker> good thinkin
[12:02:01] <scottjehl> removeOnHideIfItWasLoadedWithAjax
[12:02:07] <_nickel> scottjehl: that
[12:02:15] * _nickel laughs
[12:02:23] <gseguin> :)
[12:02:26] <toddparker> catchy
[12:02:41] <scottjehl> that's one long camel
[12:03:05] <_nickel> thesaurus == useless
[12:03:26] <_nickel> data-horde
[12:03:26] <_nickel> lol
[12:03:30] <gseguin> :)
[12:03:31] <_nickel> *hoard
[12:03:43] <toddparker> +1
[12:03:46] <scottjehl> summon
[12:03:51] <toddparker> we have a winner
[12:04:04] <_nickel> lol
[12:04:13] <scottjehl> anyone have any D&D references?
[12:04:25] <_nickel> hah
[12:04:25] * gseguin had to look at the dictionnary
[12:04:37] <_nickel> I spent a good half an hour on twitter the other day busting them out
[12:04:42] <_nickel> mace + 1
[12:05:04] <_nickel> "Whats my THACO I want to attack the dwarf"
[12:05:09] <toddparker> nerd.
[12:05:26] <_nickel> my nerdery knows no bounds friend
[12:05:29] <scottjehl> data-hoarder
[12:05:37] <toddparker> like it it
[12:05:44] <scottjehl> that goes on the container
[12:05:53] <_nickel> data-retain?
[12:06:06] <scottjehl> data-container now becomes data-hoarder
[12:06:09] <toddparker> preserve
[12:06:10] <_nickel> dom-cache is also pretty good
[12:06:20] <scottjehl> yep. it is
[12:06:24] <toddparker> mothball
[12:06:29] <_nickel> lol
[12:06:32] <gseguin> lol
[12:07:13] <scottjehl> domCache seems like a winner
[12:07:17] <gseguin> I like preserve
[12:07:18] <toddparker> accumulate
[12:07:19] <_nickel> yessir
[12:07:23] <toddparker> amass
[12:07:27] <toddparker> reserve
[12:07:29] <scottjehl> or flip it
[12:07:31] <scottjehl> domRemove
[12:07:31] <_nickel> domCache +1
[12:07:40] <scottjehl> default to true
[12:07:44] <toddparker> yeah, that is still best
[12:07:51] <scottjehl> I guess bool attrs should default to false eh?
[12:07:55] <toddparker> that is the question - default?
[12:08:16] <toddparker> i think we shouldn't have an unlimited dom by default
[12:08:19] <scottjehl> slay all pages by default
[12:08:25] <toddparker> seems irresponsible
[12:08:32] <toddparker> smite them
[12:08:55] <scottjehl> domCache
[12:09:15] <scottjehl> y/n?
[12:09:20] <toddparker> http://images.mmorpg.com/images/newsImages/172011/SMITE_t.jpg
[12:09:39] <toddparker> _nickel, this you? http://mmohut.com/wp-content/gallery/dungeons-and-dragons-online-overview/dnd-online-altay.jpg
[12:09:57] <gseguin> :)
[12:10:10] <scottjehl> I can make the change if agreed
[12:10:28] <scottjehl> http://scottjehl.com/i/agreed.gif
[12:10:31] <gseguin> defaulting to false?
[12:10:50] <scottjehl> yeah. domCache = false
[12:10:56] <scottjehl> option name and default
[12:10:58] <toddparker> +1
[12:11:24] <gseguin> +1
[12:11:47] <_nickel> toddparker: I will find screenshots of my wow characters, though I don't play anymore
[12:12:05] <_nickel> scottjehl: I'm for it
[12:12:30] <ryanneufeld> hey guys, i know this channel is more for you guys to talk about dev, but I've got an issue with the latest git on production
[12:13:10] <ryanneufeld> any chance someone could find a few mins today to take a look?
[12:13:20] <gseguin> Hi Ryan
[12:13:24] <scottjehl> is there a bug you're referring to?]
[12:13:30] <ryanneufeld> seems to be
[12:13:36] <ryanneufeld> m.metrolyrics.com
[12:13:39] <scottjehl> in the tracker I mean
[12:13:40] <toddparker> we're cranking on getting beta 2 out, so we'll see
[12:13:43] <ryanneufeld> ah
[12:13:58] <ryanneufeld> starting from / if I open a link, and then go back
[12:14:09] <ryanneufeld> the buttons/links on the page don't fire anymore
[12:14:22] <gseguin> ryanneufeld: scottjehl meant an issue on github
[12:17:17] <ryanneufeld> I can't find one related to this
[12:17:36] <ryanneufeld> it seems the hashchange event isn't firing properly
[12:18:14] <gseguin> can you file one and attach jsbin where the issue can be observed?
[12:18:32] <ryanneufeld> jsbin isn't neccessary, this code is live :S
[12:18:44] <ryanneufeld> I missed the bug before I launched :S
[12:18:54] <scottjehl> easiest to debug in an isolated example though
[12:20:02] <toddparker> yeah, please look for a ticket and if one doesn't exist, create a new issue with a minimal test case page
[12:20:21] <scottjehl> then we're happy to take a look :)
[12:20:47] <toddparker> please use a tool like jSBin and refer to the latest builds so we know if this is already fixed
[12:20:54] <toddparker> template here: http://jsbin.com/ufineg/edit
[12:21:03] <toddparker> thanks!
[12:22:36] <ryanneufeld> okay
[12:22:48] <_nickel> scottjehl: just realized I didn't finish two tests on the caching branch
[12:22:57] <_nickel> scottjehl: is there time for me to slap those in there quickly?
[12:23:00] <_nickel> shouldn't take too long
[12:23:12] <scottjehl> all yours
[12:23:17] <scottjehl> can you change the name too?
[12:23:19] <scottjehl> :)
[12:29:13] <_nickel> yes!
[12:29:20] <scottjehl> thanks
[12:29:23] <toddparker> cool
[12:29:33] <toddparker> should i wait to test? already started
[12:30:37] <_nickel> nope
[12:30:41] <_nickel> go ahead
[12:30:50] <_nickel> well
[12:31:43] <_nickel> we should make the name change first but I don't think its a dire situation
[12:31:57] <scottjehl> what we're testing should be fine to do now
[12:32:07] <scottjehl> mostly seeing if this causes lots of requests
[12:32:12] <scottjehl> re-requests
[13:00:12] <ryanneufeld> is jquerymobile.com/test/ running latest?
[13:04:13] <eddiemonge> latest from git
[13:04:48] <ryanneufeld> thx
[13:05:38] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddparker: namespace change pushed
[13:08:54] <scottjehl> nice
[13:08:55] <scottjehl> thanks
[13:27:53] <_nickel> scottjehl: tests are in
[13:28:05] <scottjehl> great!
[13:28:24] <_nickel> going to give my daughter a bath and then I'll get back to the selectmenu
[13:40:10] <gseguin> toddparker: transitions work great in FF desktop
[13:41:51] <gseguin> toddparker: I'm not sure of the purpose of the z-index in the transitions' css rules
[13:42:14] <gseguin> removing them doesn't seem to change anything
[13:42:59] <scottjehl> I think it's for transitions where pages overlap
[13:44:35] <gseguin> which does not happen anymore since we're sliding out the previous page
[13:45:39] <gseguin> I guess for pop it could still be useful
[14:01:24] <scottjehl> don't slidedown and slideup overlap too?
[14:01:29] <scottjehl> and fade
[14:01:46] <gseguin> not anymore
[14:02:25] <gseguin> slidedown and slideup both in and out pages are moving
[14:02:42] <gseguin> yeah fade I haven't touched
[14:06:16] <scottjehl> slide up and down should overlap
[14:06:48] <gseguin> why?
[14:07:05] <toddparker> because it's a slide up, not a "push"
[14:07:19] <scottjehl> and that's the current behavior
[14:07:23] <gseguin> ok
[14:07:29] <toddparker> supposed to look like the dialog/page is sliding up over the current page
[14:07:32] <scottjehl> we definitely don't want this to change any existing behavior
[14:07:37] <gseguin> so that means the out page is not supposed to move
[14:07:44] <scottjehl> right
[14:07:49] <gseguin> ok, I'll change that
[14:07:50] <scottjehl> in a few transitions that's true
[14:08:32] <toddparker> yeah, these should look/behave as they do now
[14:10:02] <gseguin> alright
[14:25:25] <toddparker> interesting
[14:25:25] <toddparker> https://github.com/azicchetti/jquerymobile-router
[14:32:35] <_nickel> toddparker: we need to do a markdown education class at jqcon boston it seemd :D
[14:32:38] <_nickel> </snark>
[14:32:49] <_nickel> s/seemd/seems/
[14:34:07] <toddparker> heh
[14:34:18] <toddparker> ascii FTW
[14:48:52] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddparker: so a quick update on the select decoupling
[14:49:00] <_nickel> I'm taking a refactoring approach to it
[14:49:10] <_nickel> incrementally seperating and isolating the code that each requires
[14:49:48] <_nickel> scottjehl: I undid the change you made, and I'll push what I'm doing now
[14:50:13] <_nickel> its not the endgame its just the fastest way to split things up and centralize everything without having it in one big scoped create function
[14:51:19] <_nickel> basically I'm picking the low hanging fruit and doing some testing as I go
[14:57:55] <toddparker> thanks!
[15:02:05] <_nickel> scottjehl: toddparker: gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/decoupled-select/js/jquery.mobile.forms.select.js
[15:02:21] <_nickel> getting them completely seperate will let me move the custom select out to another plugin
[15:07:07] * gseguin is catching up
[15:12:22] <gseguin> darn that's going to screw up my pull request: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2102
[15:12:34] <gseguin> isn't it?
[15:14:36] * gseguin takes that back
[15:16:57] <gseguin> _nickel: it looks good
[15:20:12] <toddparker> so is that pull ok?
[15:20:27] <toddparker> blog post for this week so far: http://jquerymobile.com/?p=1321&preview=true
[15:20:34] <toddparker> lemme know if you need a login
[15:20:38] <gseguin> 2102?
[15:20:45] <toddparker> ya
[15:21:04] <gseguin> yeah, landing it, I'll fix the coding standard issue
[15:21:04] <_nickel> gseguin: its a small change
[15:21:09] <_nickel> when we merge I'll have to sort it out
[15:21:30] <_nickel> or rather when I rebase before we merge I'll have to sort it out
[15:21:33] <_nickel> such is life
[15:21:57] <gseguin> landed
[15:27:31] <scottjehl> so, Bender, we're going to run that branch through a Charles proxy tomorrow and see how different devices react.
[15:29:15] <scottjehl> ..how soon previously visited pages are re-requested from the server, etc
[15:40:03] <_nickel> scottjehl: "charles proxy" interesting
[15:41:29] <scottjehl> yeah I mean, it's an easy way to do it
[15:46:28] <_nickel> stalled working on getting vpn acces at adobe :(
[15:51:40] <scottjehl> looks like I've got pushstate working through an external 50 line file
[15:51:48] <scottjehl> this could be a lot safer
[17:28:56] <gseguin> toddparker: ping
