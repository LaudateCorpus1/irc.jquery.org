[03:35:07] <aaronmcadam> anyone around?
[03:35:13] <aaronmcadam> toddparker?
[11:02:37] <todd_> hey all
[11:02:41] <todd_>  meeting starting in a minute
[11:34:49] <gseguin> miketaylr: so you're saying both oTransitionEnd and otransitionend work?
[11:35:09] <miketaylr> gseguin: i think so, let me make a quick test to be sure
[11:35:41] <gseguin> ok
[11:41:40] <miketaylr> gseguin: yeah, seems like both work. i'd go w/ oTransitionEnd since that's what we have documented though
[11:42:01] <gseguin> miketaylr: ok, thanks very much for checking
[11:42:07] <miketaylr> np
[13:07:05] <miketaylr> gseguin: hey, just asked some core devs and apparently 'oTransitionEnd' is a documentation bug :/ 'OTransitionEnd' is correct
[13:07:17] <miketaylr> (even though both work, but whatever'
[13:07:18] <miketaylr> )
[13:21:46] <gseguin> miketaylr: alright, changing that back, thanks for the heads up
[13:22:01] <miketaylr> sorry for the confusion...
[13:22:06] <miketaylr> i'm still a little confused
[13:22:12] * miketaylr shakes fist at documentation bugs
[13:22:16] <gseguin> np
[14:05:04] <todd_> hey gseguin
[14:05:06] <todd_> yt?
[14:05:24] <gseguin> 'sup?
[14:05:50] <todd_> working on the blog post and wanted to find out what vendor prefixed transitions we're adding
[14:05:58] <todd_> opera, firefox, webkit
[14:06:04] <todd_> plus standard
[14:06:11] <gseguin> exactly
[14:06:13] <todd_> is there one for ie/wp7?
[14:06:27] <gseguin> I haven't added any for IE
[14:06:35] <gseguin> I don't have anything to test IE
[14:07:11] <todd_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5103283/does-internet-explorer-support-css-transitions
[14:07:17] <todd_> guess maybe ie 10
[14:08:14] <gseguin> will they support the standard properties?
[14:08:24] <todd_> http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/info/ReleaseNotes/Default.html
[14:08:49] <todd_> UPDATE (Oct. 30/2010) The latest release of the IE9 Platform Preview has added support for 2D transforms using the -ms- prefix. While this does not yet mean this feature is included in IE9 Beta, it suggests it will be included in IE9′s full release, so I’ve added a yellow checkmark to indicate partial support for now.
[14:09:38] <gseguin> hmm ok
[14:09:53] <todd_> that doesn't jibe
[14:09:55] <todd_> anyway
[14:10:04] <gseguin> I can add -ms prefixes
[14:12:02] <gseguin> http://samuli.hakoniemi.net/css3-transitions-are-we-there-yet/ states that "The best support for IE Transitions and Transformations can be achieved with Matrix Filter."
[14:13:16] <gseguin> todd_: I don't think we want to go there, do we?
