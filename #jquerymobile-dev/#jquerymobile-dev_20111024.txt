[08:42:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/checkboxradio-label-click] test that click is fired on checkboxradio child input - John Bender
[08:42:36] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: can I ask you guys a favor?
[08:43:41] <johnbender> I just pushed my branch fix for 1335 and I've done a fair amount of testing. Just wondering if you guys can give it a once through
[08:44:11] <johnbender> toddparker: this one makes me want to do a quick release candidate since it's something of a drastic change
[08:44:24] <johnbender> "drastic" meaning larger than we've made thus far with respect to bug fixes
[08:44:29] <johnbender> and possible more impactful
[09:05:31] <toddparker> hey johnbender
[09:05:53] <toddparker> we could do a RC3 laster this week with this and the select menu bug fix
[09:08:04] <johnbender> cool

[09:08:12] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1077 on jquery-mobile, reported by chenchen (8m, 1w ago): Native select Menu no event on Adroid 2.2 or above
[09:08:24] <johnbender> did that fix make it up onto test?
[09:08:28] <johnbender> I know that was backed up on Friday
[09:08:34] <johnbender> toddparker: that would be awesome
[09:08:49] <johnbender> toddparker: do you want me to just push to master then?
[09:14:56] <eddiemonge> toddparker: could you email out that static list page you have that you are testing on?
[09:18:34] <gseguin> eddiemonge: I've tried this: http://progit.org/book/ch9-7.html#removing_objects
[09:18:46] <gseguin> to clean up the repo with no real success
[09:18:50] <gseguin> :(
[09:19:02] <eddiemonge> timmywil: you there?
[09:19:21] <eddiemonge> gseguin: yeah i think i tried that too and it just made my local copy bigger
[09:19:31] <timmywil> eddiemonge: hey
[09:21:00] <eddiemonge> think you could check out the jqm repo and see if you can work any magic in shrinking it down in size?
[09:21:19] <eddiemonge> i think getting it down from over 100mb's in size would be good for a 1.0 release
[09:21:56] <gseguin> the problem is that all the binaries of the initial design have originally been checked in
[09:22:03] <gseguin> and later removed

[09:22:33] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1335 on jquery-mobile, reported by anttears (6m, 3w ago): Label clicks not firing event on associated radio buttons
[09:22:56] <johnbender> that's a bit of explanation from a conversation the Kin and I had about how the checkboxradio clicks are swallowed and why
[09:23:08] <johnbender> and if we make this change I'm proposing we should at least stop propagation
[09:23:52] <toddparker> johnbender: how much did you test the check/radio change? if you covered the key devices, pushing makes sense
[09:24:05] <toddparker> btw - Wilto is sick today
[09:24:18] <toddparker> i thought that change he made went up
[09:27:26] <toddparker> so his change went up, but it's not working for me on test
[09:28:41] <johnbender> toddparker: not working for me either
[09:28:56] <toddparker> wait
[09:29:01] <johnbender> toddparker: I have some changes I'm going to make that branch for the checkbox clicking fix
[09:29:05] <toddparker> i just cleared cache and it's working on 2.2
[09:29:09] <johnbender> nice
[09:29:17] <johnbender> let me check real fast on 2.3
[09:29:23] <toddparker> m
[09:29:26] <toddparker> k
[09:29:32] <toddparker> i letter typo!
[09:29:38] <toddparker> level up
[09:30:10] <johnbender> I'll test again on the devices I have once I make those changes and push to master
[09:32:52] <toddparker> selects seem o on 2.2 and 2.3 with Wilto's fix
[09:33:00] <toddparker> wonder if that was a cache issue
[09:35:25] <toddparker> kinblas and eddiemonge - i don't have the static markup hardly but I can quickly re-create if needed. just grab the node from chime inspector
[09:36:09] <kinblas> toddparker: is this in regards to the scrolling performance email I sent?
[09:36:34] <toddparker> yeah kinblas
[09:36:36] <kinblas> toddparker: If so, I was specifically asking you since you already had an iOS5 device and was familiar with what you were seeing as the perf problem :-)
[09:36:42] <toddparker> sure
[09:36:44] <toddparker> i can do that
[09:36:52] <kinblas> I can send you a static snapshot if you want
[09:37:22] <toddparker> nah, take 30 seconds to make it
[09:37:43] <kinblas> toddparker: sorry, I just want confirmation that what I found is indeed the cause of what *YOU* see :-)
[09:38:11] <toddparker> ok, sure
[09:39:24] <eddiemonge> toddparker: i forgot i could do that
[09:39:34] <toddparker> yep, easy eddiemonge
[09:39:56] <eddiemonge> timmywil: think thats something you might be able to do or take a look at re: removing old binary references?
[09:43:17] <toddparker> kinblas: so killing touch start doesn't seem to make a huge difference
[09:43:43] <kinblas> ??
[09:44:02] <toddparker> i just wonder why that hangup is
[09:44:05] <kinblas> toddparker: if you start with your static snapshot with no JS ... it is fast
[09:44:09] <kinblas> right?
[09:44:26] <toddparker> lemme check
[09:44:30] <kinblas> toddparker: then if you add that one line of script I sent in the email, to your head, you see no difference?
[09:44:54] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm going to send you my static snapshot just so we are on the same *page* ...
[09:44:58] <kinblas> literally
[09:44:59] <kinblas> :-)
[09:45:05] <toddparker> w/no js it is pretty smooth
[09:45:27] <toddparker> is does tend to have a smaller handgun when scrolling but it's a lot better
[09:45:32] <toddparker> heh
[09:46:10] <kinblas> toddparker: I sent you my test case
[09:46:25] <kinblas> you just need to adjust the CSS link in the head to point to whatever it is you are using
[09:46:35] <toddparker> k
[09:46:40] <kinblas> the file is a static snapshot with a single line of script in the head
[09:47:15] <kinblas> if you could compare the speed with that line commented out (removed) and with it enabled that would be great
[09:47:29] <timmywil> eddiemonge: sry, been in the jquery meeting.  say what now?
[09:47:57] <toddparker> so kinblas i dropped you page in
[09:47:59] <toddparker> smooth
[09:48:21] <toddparker> better than my page for some reason
[09:48:27] * kinblas sighs
[09:48:35] <toddparker> i also squared off the icon discs in my css for good measure
[09:48:41] <kinblas> toddparker: does it have a script block in the head with an addEventListener call?
[09:48:52] <kinblas> sometimes our mail server strips JS
[09:48:52] <toddparker> ya
[09:48:56] <timmywil> eddiemonge: is there a mobile ticket?
[09:49:14] <kinblas> toddparker: what are you testing on? an iPhone 4 or an iPad?
[09:49:53] <toddparker> iphone 4
[09:50:10] <toddparker> oh snap so you have the full rendered page
[09:50:12] <toddparker> ok
[09:50:27] <toddparker> i just dropped in core and mobile before that script block
[09:50:48] <toddparker> had to remove the lsitview data attr so pre net duplicate markup
[09:51:01] <kinblas> right, all you have to do is update the link path to the CSS
[09:51:03] <toddparker> and it feels great
[09:51:20] <kinblas> ok that wasn't what I was looking for :-P
[09:51:25] <toddparker> heh
[09:51:26] <kinblas> on iPad iOS 4.3.5
[09:51:26] <toddparker> i know
[09:51:32] <kinblas> it hiccups a lot
[09:51:34] <toddparker> touch start = very bad news
[09:51:47] <toddparker> this page now is great
[09:51:52] <toddparker> even w/ JS in there
[09:52:09] <eddiemonge> timmywil: there might be
[09:52:12] <kinblas> toddparker: what page were you using for your testing?
[09:52:19] <toddparker> hmmm
[09:52:30] <toddparker> so if i comment out that touch start block
[09:52:35] <toddparker> the page still scrolls pretty well
[09:52:40] <toddparker> wtf
[09:52:45] <kinblas> I thought we were using the same page /test/tests/speed/
[09:53:21] <timmywil> eddiemonge: oh, :P i read that wrong.
[09:53:23] <kinblas> jquerymobile.com/test/tests/speed/lists-u.html
[09:53:33] <eddiemonge> timmywil: here you go: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2822
[09:53:33] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2822 on jquery-mobile, reported by eddiemonge (9.454s ago): Reduce Git repo size
[09:53:53] <toddparker> kinblas: what is that URL? jquerymobile.com/test/tests/speed/lists-u.html
[09:53:53] <toddparker>  is a 494
[09:53:56] <toddparker> 404
[09:54:13] <timmywil> are all of the branches on jquery-mobile being used currently?
[09:54:58] <eddiemonge> kinblas johnbender toddparker gseguin ^^^ thats a question for yous
[09:55:01] <kinblas> toddparker: hmmm I guess we don't pull the speed directory on to jquerymobile.com?
[09:55:17] <kinblas> timmywil: there are a few old ones I need to hang on to
[09:55:23] <kinblas> specifically the pagecontainer one
[09:56:59] <toddparker> hmmm
[09:57:08] <toddparker> so kin i need to hop off for about an hour for a meeting
[09:57:24] <kinblas> toddparker: Ok
[09:57:47] <toddparker> odd thing is if i take the original perf page and drop in the script to disable touch start, it doesn't seem to improve things
[09:57:53] <toddparker> not much anyway
[09:57:57] <toddparker> what is going on?!?!?
[09:58:13] <toddparker> could we be doing some extra work somewhere
[09:58:44] <toddparker> kinblas: do you have test devices that feel slow for you to test on in the meantime?
[09:59:10] <toddparker> btw - to test the icon disc perf diff
[09:59:15] <toddparker> open the theme css
[09:59:20] <toddparker> change this:
[09:59:24] <toddparker> .ui-icon,
[09:59:24] <toddparker> .ui-icon-searchfield:after {
[09:59:25] <toddparker> 	background: 						#666 /*{global-icon-color}*/;
[09:59:25] <toddparker> 	background: 						rgba(0,0,0,.4) /*{global-icon-disc}*/;
[09:59:25] <toddparker> 	background-image: url(images/icons-18-white.png) /*{global-icon-set}*/;
[09:59:26] <toddparker> 	background-repeat: no-repeat;
[09:59:26] <toddparker> 	-moz-border-radius: 				9px;
[09:59:26] <toddparker> 	-webkit-border-radius: 				9px;
[09:59:26] <toddparker> 	border-radius: 						9px;
[09:59:27] <toddparker> }
[09:59:39] <toddparker> well, remove the last 3 rules w/9px in them
[10:00:14] <toddparker> be back in a bit guys!
[10:03:41] <Wilto> So, the consensus is that the Android select issue is looking good for everyone?
[10:04:59] <eddiemonge> arent you supposed to be sick?
[10:05:41] <Wilto> I figure I’ll use my last fleeting moments on Earth to check in on some issues, as this—this—is the cold that finally kills me.
[10:05:50] <eddiemonge> lol
[10:06:27] <eddiemonge> timmywil: are the file refs in all the branches or just in master? im not sure how git handles binary files that have been removed from the repo
[10:07:47] <timmywil> eddiemonge: objects can be shared unless there are different versions of the same object afaik
[10:08:02] <timmywil> but yea, your big ones are these .ai files
[10:08:50] <timmywil> 60gb and 21gb
[10:08:59] <timmywil> uncompressed
[10:09:11] <Wilto> Woof.
[10:09:24] <eddiemonge> gb? or mb?
[10:09:37] <timmywil> sry, mb
[10:09:38] <timmywil> heh
[10:09:55] <timmywil> 60,000,000 bytes
[10:10:31] <eddiemonge> how do we get rid of them? ive tried the stuff in the gitbook but it dont work.
[10:12:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] jblas pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/N3TsBg
[10:12:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Prepend $.mobile to docs to fix code example - Michael
[10:12:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #2823 from mcherbie/master - Kin Blas
[10:13:38] <timmywil> eddiemonge: lemme fiddle around
[10:18:19] <eddiemonge> sure thing. and thanks
[10:21:01] <timmywil> how bout i just remove the whole design folder
[10:22:11] <eddiemonge> that could work
[10:23:22] <timmywil> mmm, this is satisfying
[10:23:44] <eddiemonge> lol. deleting stuff?
[10:24:08] <timmywil> yea, it's doing a recursive rm --cached over 3324 commits :P
[10:25:36] <timmywil> this may have to be done by someone with commit access as this will require a forced update
[10:25:52] <timmywil> but i can give the commands
[10:25:56] <timmywil> to do it
[10:29:01] <gseguin> johnbender: ^^^
[10:32:47] <timmywil> git filter-branch --index-filter 'git rm -r --cached --ignore-unmatch design/' -- 9635e6b^..
[10:32:56] <timmywil> rm -Rf .git/refs/original
[10:33:06] <timmywil> rm -Rf .git/logs/
[10:33:10] <timmywil> git gc
[10:33:17] <timmywil> git push -f
[10:33:39] <timmywil> make sure to be up to date first or you'll lose any commits you don't have
[10:34:09] <timmywil> i'm testing on a fork first
[10:34:31] <gseguin> thanks for looking into that timmywil
[10:34:42] <timmywil> gseguin: np!
[10:35:18] <timmywil> hmm, there is a concern
[10:35:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] jblas pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/ZHLo9g
[10:35:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master' - jblas@adobe.com
[10:35:31] <timmywil> other branches will have to rebase off of master
[10:36:59] <timmywil> lemme check
[10:37:11] <timmywil> dropped to 16.20 MB btw
[10:37:42] <gseguin> oh wow! that's awesome
[10:40:02] <kinblas> ugh, i think I screwed something up
[10:42:32] <kinblas> ok whew
[10:42:55] <kinblas> hey so if I forked jquery-mobile into my personal repository area
[10:43:24] <kinblas> why does it show up in jquery/jquery-mobile when I update my forked copy?
[10:47:37] <Wilto> We should now be able to put “90% lighter codebase” in the next changelog, as long as no one asks us to clarify.
[10:48:34] <gseguin> :)
[10:48:40] <eddiemonge> timmywil: so thats a pretty safe change we could do today
[10:48:41] <eddiemonge> ?
[10:49:05] <timmywil> a big concern is the branches
[10:49:15] <timmywil> this is rewriting about 3000 commits
[10:50:09] <timmywil> rebasing would be a pain in the ass, but im seeing if i can apply the same thing to a branch and seeing if that's close enough to master
[10:50:52] <kinblas> timmywil: so if none of us have any outstanding changes locally for branches ... after these changes, we can just re-pull the branches locally in a fressh tree and be ok?
[10:51:45] <timmywil> making new branches off the new master will be fine.  branches won't get lost, but trying to merge them or rebase them is pretty much impossible
[10:52:35] <timmywil> https://github.com/timmywil/jquery-mobile/branches
[10:52:48] <timmywil> notice how they all say 3,324 behind
[10:53:05] <timmywil> trying to merge or rebase could reintroduce those design files
[10:53:31] <kinblas> timmywil: at least in my case, I think that's ok, as long as I can see the changes that were made in that branch that were different from what was on the master at the time it was branched
[10:53:49] <kinblas> timmywil: my branches are saving experiments that we want to revisit post 1.0
[10:54:01] <timmywil> maybe it would be safest to make an "old-master" branch just in case
[10:54:23] <kinblas> timmywil: what does this do to folks who have forked repostiories?
[10:54:55] <eddiemonge> should those branches even exist in jquery/jquery-mobile? they seem like they should be in forked/local copies instead
[10:55:13] <timmywil> kinblas: they'll have to reset or remkae their master
[10:55:19] <timmywil> brb
[10:55:31] <kinblas> eddiemonge: they were "official" work that we decided last minute to punt
[10:56:00] <eddiemonge> could we remove them?
[10:56:12] <kinblas> eddiemonge: they are things we want to revisit after 1.0
[10:56:27] <kinblas> part of the punting was due to time constraints for 1.0
[10:56:33] <kinblas> it's not really throw a way work
[10:56:45] <kinblas> unless you want to start over again
[10:57:28] <kinblas> I just updated my fork to the latest jquery-mobile .. hence my question about forked repos
[10:57:32] <eddiemonge> im not saying throw the work out, im just saying throw the branches out but keep the work
[10:58:19] <kinblas> eddiemonge: I just updated my repo, in case this stuff disappears :-)
[10:58:58] <kinblas> The one thing I haven't figured out is how to make the branches appear in my forked repository
[10:59:25] <kinblas> I can check them out locally, but I want them to appear in the branches page of my repository ... without having to rename them
[11:04:42] <eddiemonge> git push origin branch_name i think
[11:07:27] <johnbender> kinblas: timmywil: my only concern with that is that people will have to be notified about the force pushed changes
[11:07:33] <johnbender> those who have existing branches
[11:07:40] <johnbender> and we already get a lot of "I'm new to git"
[11:08:43] <eddiemonge> i think the only time it will be an issue is when they submit a pull req
[11:09:13] <eddiemonge> at which point we can tell them of the changes (if any) they have to make to their repo
[11:09:21] * johnbender sighs
[11:09:42] <kinblas> eddiemonge: changes? Won't they have to re-fork?
[11:09:43] <eddiemonge> but with a 1.0 release there will hopefully be an influx of new users cloning the repo
[11:09:55] <eddiemonge> i dont think so
[11:10:12] <eddiemonge> but timmywil would know better than i do
[11:19:04] <timmywil> no refork necessary
[11:19:12] <timmywil> git reset --hard origin/master
[11:19:24] <timmywil> actually git fetch; git reset --hard origin/master
[11:19:36] <timmywil> that's all
[11:19:52] <timmywil> we've done it several times on core
[11:20:02] <eddiemonge> and thats only if people want to submit a patch right?
[11:20:43] <timmywil> i assume anyone with a fork would want to keep their master up to date
[11:20:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #170: SUCCESS in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/170/
[11:20:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Rough support for scroll propagation. Still some bugs to fix.
[11:20:58] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Get nested scrolling to work. Still need to get scroll direction locking functioning.
[11:20:58] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Fixed direction locking and propagation.
[11:20:59] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: - Refactored some code.
[11:20:59] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Some fine tuning for when we actually propagate scrolling. We now limit propagation to vertical or horizontal directions.
[11:21:00] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Renamed _direction to _directionLock.
[11:21:00] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Fixed a bug that was causing a vertical scrollview to jump to (0,0) when the directionLock calculated was horizontal.
[11:21:01] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Removed style properties for ui-scrollview-clip and ui-scrollview-view from the stylesheet. We now set them progrmatically since they are required.
[11:21:01] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Made setElementTransform() a generic function so it can be shared with the scrolllistview code.
[11:21:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Make sure newX and newY are initialized to the current scroll offsets. This fixes a scroll propagation bug that was resetting the non-scrolled dimension to zero.
[11:21:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Implemented scroll viewport paging.
[11:21:03] <timmywil> but they're fork would just be behind if they didn't
[11:21:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Sync up the scrollview code with the jquery-mobile mainline.
[11:21:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mgriff_: Prepend $.mobile to docs to fix code example
[11:22:17] <timmywil> it is especially important for those submitting a patch as this is a major change to the repo and it would be difficult to merge their changes, but it is not hard to do
[11:22:17] <eddiemonge> timmywil: so with the branches, what would the best strategy be?
[11:22:35] <timmywil> hard to update master that is
[11:24:35] <timmywil> depending on the importance of the branches, this may or may not be a change worth making.  branches would pretty much need to get remade if they were to be merged into master in the future.
[11:25:47] <timmywil> it's unfortunate that it had to go back so far to remove the files from the cache
[11:30:16] <timmywil> actually, hold on
[11:32:07] <timmywil> ok, NEVERMIND. i think this is more workable than I thought.
[11:33:40] <timmywil> if you ever need to merge a branch in, do git rebase master on the branch, git rebase --skip every conflict, do git merge --squash branch onto master, and git reset HEAD design/ to keep design untracked and delete it again
[11:33:51] <timmywil> that'll work
[11:34:20] <timmywil> sorry for the scare.  I'm used to going through every conflict, but in this case it's entirely unnecessary
[11:34:56] <eddiemonge> do what? can you repeat that in pastable commands?
[11:35:31] <timmywil> git checkout branch_name (or git checkout origin/branch_name -b branch_name if it hasn't been checked out before)
[11:35:36] <timmywil> git rebase master
[11:35:45] <timmywil> git rebase --skip (until complete)
[11:35:59] <timmywil> it won't be more than about 5 times
[11:36:06] <timmywil> git checkout master
[11:36:11] <timmywil> git merge --squash branch_name
[11:36:19] <timmywil> git reset HEAD design/
[11:36:30] <timmywil> rm -rf design/
[11:36:36] <timmywil> commit and continue as normal
[11:37:49] <timmywil> if you ever have an issue, I can fix it
[11:38:44] <eddiemonge> kinblas: does that cover your concerns?
[11:42:10] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: scottjehl: kinblas: can you guys hold off on pushing commits
[11:42:45] <Wilto> No worries—workin’ on something else today.
[11:43:21] <timmywil> brb again
[11:43:35] <gseguin> same here, just give a green light by email when it's okay to start pushing again
[11:43:48] <toddparker> hey all
[11:43:53] <toddparker> doing some clean, eh?
[11:43:58] <toddparker> kinblas: i'm back
[11:44:31] <Wilto> Hey Todd.
[11:45:42] <eddiemonge> i updated https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2822 with these notes
[11:45:42] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2822 on jquery-mobile, reported by eddiemonge (1h, 52m ago): Reduce Git repo size
[11:45:57] <eddiemonge> johnbender: are you trying these?
[11:46:39] <johnbender> eddiemonge: no, dealing with another issue
[11:46:48] <eddiemonge> oh.
[11:47:01] <eddiemonge> well this might be a good time to do the cleanup then maybe?
[11:48:53] <eddiemonge> timmywil: these instructions should work on my local repo right? after doing those, the folder size didnt change. do i have to do something else?
[11:52:44] <Wilto> Looks like it’s back to the drawing board on this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1077
[11:52:44] <timmywil_> The folder size will be the same because the files weren't actually removed, but someone pulling down master will only pull 16mb
[11:52:45] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1077 on jquery-mobile, reported by chenchen (8m, 1w ago): Native select Menu no event on Adroid 2.2 or above
[11:53:23] <gseguin> oh so eddiemonge, we've been doing the right thing all along :)
[11:54:11] <eddiemonge> yeah looks like it
[11:54:17] <eddiemonge> we just didnt know it lol
[11:54:20] <timmywil_> They can be fully removed with git prune of so desired
[11:56:23] <eddiemonge> were those instructions i posted on gh correct?
[11:57:24] <timmywil_> I'm on my phone right now, but I'll check soon
[12:06:27] <toddparker> yeah Wilto
[12:06:29] <toddparker> bummer
[12:07:19] <Wilto> Well, my own fault for counting on a voodoo fix. I’ll take another crack at it first thing tomorrow morning.
[12:07:30] <toddparker> wilt - did you see that comment saying that the antive menu selects works until you open a custom one?
[12:07:36] <toddparker> might be a clue
[12:08:13] <toddparker> true on 2.2 and 2.3
[12:08:46] <Wilto> Yeah. Still bizarre, but it’s something to go on.
[12:09:01] <toddparker> yeah
[12:09:13] <timmywil> back
[12:09:18] <toddparker> actually not true
[12:09:29] <timmywil> eddiemonge: where'd you post them?
[12:09:32] <Wilto> I can dig into it a little now, but I don’t want to try anything until I’ve got the devices in hand.
[12:09:43] <toddparker> if you refresh the gallery page wilto, the selected work until you hit a custom select
[12:09:53] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2822 with these notes
[12:09:54] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2822 on jquery-mobile, reported by eddiemonge (2h, 16m ago): Reduce Git repo size
[12:09:57] <toddparker> but if you navigate there via ajax, they don't; work from the start
[12:09:59] <eddiemonge> timmywil: ^^^
[12:10:05] <toddparker> my hunch is that something else is going on here
[12:10:40] <timmywil> yup looks right
[12:11:05] <Wilto> I mean, that shouldn’t be impacting/impacted by a CSS thing at all…
[12:11:36] <timmywil> the pagecontainer branch looks really far behind the current master. was it the plan that that branch will get merged into master some time in the future?
[12:12:01] <toddparker> i know Wilto
[12:12:03] <toddparker> odd
[12:12:19] <Wilto> This stuff wouldn’t be any fun if it were easy, right?
[12:12:28] <toddparker> unless something that the page show or custom select code does throws this off
[12:12:40] <toddparker> a class is added/removed, focus is shifted, etc.
[12:12:49] <toddparker> kinblas: you around?
[12:13:11] <eddiemonge> im off for the day but thanks timmywil for your (continuing) help
[12:13:20] <timmywil> eddiemonge: np
[12:14:53] <Wilto> That’s what I’m thinking, yeah.
[12:15:05] <timmywil> ah, the pagecontainer branch is just new files, nvm
[12:16:30] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: gseguin: scottjehl: you guys can continue to make commits
[12:20:07] <toddparker> kinblas: you around?
[12:25:39] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah
[12:25:52] <kinblas> toddparker: was going to step out for lunch soon
[12:25:54] <kinblas> what's up?
[12:25:54] <toddparker> did you manage to get the Thomson PR page cleaned up last week?
[12:26:05] <toddparker> wrong window
[12:26:16] <kinblas> that would be a no :-)
[12:26:28] <toddparker> heh
[12:26:37] <toddparker> so kin, i'm around if you need testing help
[12:26:47] <toddparker> what did you discover while ei was out?
[12:31:22] <toddparker> i'm sort of mystified at how inconsistent the scroll testing has been
[12:31:30] <toddparker> kin ^^
[12:31:35] <toddparker> kinblas
[12:32:16] <toddparker> btw - my typing is worse than normal because I have a huge Phineas and Ferb bandaid on my thumb
[12:34:45] <kinblas> lol
[12:35:03] <kinblas> toddparker: I haven't done much since you left ... johnbender was schooling me on why my git foo is weak
[12:35:53] <toddparker> mine is non-existent
[12:35:57] <toddparker> so before we dive into that
[12:36:04] <toddparker> i have a mystery for you
[12:36:11] <toddparker> selects in android
[12:36:46] <toddparker> if i load the form gallery with a refresh, the selects work until i open a custom select on android 2.2 and 2.3
[12:37:07] <toddparker> but if i open the same page via ajax nav, they are busted from the start
[12:37:11] <toddparker> what the...
[12:38:13] <kinblas> toddparker:  even natives are busted?
[12:39:15] <toddparker> yep
[12:39:19] <toddparker> bad
[12:39:33] <toddparker> not sure how we missed that in testing
[12:39:48] <toddparker> but there is something fishy going on
[12:39:57] <toddparker> why would they work after a refresh
[12:40:10] <toddparker> why would the custom select menus break the native ones
[12:40:56] <toddparker> if the mechanics work after a refresh, i think there must be some class added during ajax nav or the custom select that is messing witht eh native menus
[12:41:22] <toddparker> or a focus thing?
[12:41:39] <toddparker> custom menus continue to work after the native menus break
[12:41:54] <toddparker> so the hidden select still work so i think this is some other cause
[12:42:19] <toddparker> not even sure how to debug this one
[13:01:41] <johnbender> toddparker: bisect
[13:02:21] <johnbender> toddparker: I would also see if you can reproduce with a data-role=none select
[13:02:39] <johnbender> then you just have to muck around with the styles until you find something
[13:03:11] <johnbender> we know from the bisect I did that the style addition that Wilto made for the collapsibles was at least part of the problem
[13:03:36] <johnbender> for God knows what reason
[13:04:15] <toddparker> this stuff is crazy conplex
[13:04:18] <johnbender> toddparker: there are bizarre style interactions floating around with these native selects all over the place
[13:04:35] <johnbender> remember we've already logged one bug against android for it
[13:04:42] <johnbender> I've got another one in ie9
[13:04:48] <johnbender> err the windows phone version
[13:04:54] <johnbender> and then this ugly thing
[13:05:00] <toddparker> the issue is that making the native select invisible but still clickable across all platforms is really nuts
[13:05:09] <johnbender> toddparker: :D
[13:05:16] <johnbender> but it works!
[13:05:25] <toddparker> i remember hacking away for hours on this with scott to make opera finally be happy
[13:05:26] <johnbender> it's just prone to issues
[13:05:43] <toddparker> yeah unfortunately
[13:05:53] <toddparker> because all the browsers are very particular/buggy
[13:05:58] <johnbender> toddparker: did I tell you about the combo that's causing the issue in Mango?
[13:06:18] <toddparker> the odd thong here is that is works if you start with a  fresh load
[13:06:19] <johnbender> so far 2 totally unrelated things
[13:06:30] <toddparker> it only breaks when you click the custom menu or open he page via ajax nav
[13:06:34] <toddparker> so mechanics are good
[13:06:34] <johnbender> toddparker: yah, I noted that early too
[13:06:38] <toddparker> other styles are leaking in
[13:06:43] <johnbender> it's most likely a conflict from the existing page
[13:06:50] <johnbender> which *kind of* makes sense
[13:06:50] <toddparker> could be
[13:07:03] <toddparker> but why would custom (small) menu break it
[13:07:05] <johnbender> given where the style hides the collapsible content
[13:07:12] <johnbender> toddparker: same thing
[13:07:17] <johnbender> we hide those
[13:07:26] <johnbender> well
[13:07:26] <toddparker> i see where you're going
[13:07:39] <johnbender> supposing that what I'm saying has any real merit
[13:07:51] <johnbender> which seems just as likely to be untrue
[13:07:59] <toddparker> :)
[13:58:05] <kinblas> toddparker: bah the selects work just fine in the android emulator
[14:31:07] <johnbender> alright
[14:31:14] <johnbender> toddparker: can you clarify something for me?
[14:31:26] <johnbender> kinblas: gseguin: maybe you guys can double check me here too
[14:31:39] <johnbender> actually one sec
[14:31:44] <johnbender> let me tripple check this assumption
[14:32:06] <johnbender> arg
[14:32:07] <johnbender> nevermind
[14:33:13] <kinblas> this concludes a johnbender-self-torture-test
[14:35:42] <johnbender> sigh
[14:35:43] <johnbender> seriously
[14:37:36] <johnbender> kinblas: when I trigger an event, I don't think the vmouse plugin passes along the arguments as a normal trigger would
[14:37:46] <johnbender> I don't have a sense for how difficult that would be
[14:38:50] <johnbender> kinblas: the reason being that when I trigger a click on the checkbox/radio input from the label I want to tell the bound vclick handler to returnj
[14:38:53] <johnbender> *return
[14:39:19] <johnbender> so passing in a opts object with labelClick: true would be nice
[14:40:26] <johnbender> kinblas: I can do that using widget object state but I grow tired of setting flags and cleaning them up later
[14:40:31] <johnbender> it begets problems
[14:40:32] <kinblas> johnbender: you are talking about the args after the event string?
[14:40:37] <johnbender> kinblas: yessir
[14:41:03] <kinblas> hang on one sec
[14:42:35] <kinblas> johnbender: what are you triggering?
[14:45:10] <johnbender> kinblas: click
[14:45:30] <kinblas> johnbender: I was going to say that for mouse events, it is relatively easy
[14:45:35] <kinblas> for touch events not so -easy
[14:45:48] <kinblas> since you wouldn't know which vevent those args were for
[14:46:06] <kinblas> if you look at vmouse.js
[14:46:16] <kinblas> mouseEventCallback() is what triggers vevents for mouse events
[14:46:27] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.vmouse.js#L186
[14:46:55] <kinblas> you would simply have to modify that callback to pass through any additional args to triggerVirtualEvent()
[14:47:05] <kinblas> and then modify triggerVirtualEvent() to pass those through.
[14:47:06] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.vmouse.js#L172
[14:47:40] <johnbender> kinblas: kk yah I see how it will work
[14:48:12] <johnbender> kinblas: I did look at it, and I was looking at mouseEventCallback but I didn't feel confident without asking
[14:48:26] <johnbender> though this may not absolve me of my slacker status
[14:48:28] <kinblas> but that said
[14:48:38] <kinblas> is that really what we want to do?
[14:48:50] <kinblas> should said dispatcher be triggering click?
[14:48:52] <kinblas> or vclick?
[14:49:06] <kinblas> if it's the latter, there's nothing to do
[14:50:28] <kinblas> the reason we don't pass args through is because the vevent is supposed to be triggered from either a touch event or mouse event ... it isn't supposed to be the actual event
[15:02:01] <johnbender> kinblas: agreed but is there any reason we can't support passing the args through where it's a click
[15:02:21] <johnbender> kinblas: in this case we need to trigger the click because people who bind click handlers to the checkbox need to be alerted
[15:02:38] <johnbender> or at least that's what the bug is
[15:02:44] <johnbender> so I'm assuming we should be doing that
[15:02:59] <johnbender> otherwise they'd have to bind to two places instead of one
[15:03:40] <kinblas> hmmm ok ... I think in the case where mouse events trigger it might be ok because there's a one to one relationship
[15:03:45] <kinblas> which isn't true in the touch case
[15:03:46] <johnbender> exactly
[15:03:58] <johnbender> it's not something we really need to advertise too
[15:04:07] <kinblas> ok
[15:04:17] <kinblas> give it a go
[15:04:22] <johnbender> kinblas: already done
[15:04:31] <johnbender> it's just much safer than setting flags
[15:04:40] <johnbender> managing state is hard
[15:04:45] <johnbender> so instead we'll go shopping
[15:05:18] <kinblas> lol
[15:33:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to checkboxradio-label-click: http://git.io/GujlHw
[15:33:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/checkboxradio-label-click] pass trigger arguments through virtual mouse events - John Bender
[15:33:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/checkboxradio-label-click] prevent the input vclick handler from running - John Bender
[15:35:48] <johnbender> so much thought going into such a small commit
[15:35:55] <johnbender> err
[15:35:57] <johnbender> set of commits
[16:51:17] <tbenzige> danheberden: toddparker: kinblas: i think the relative path will work just fine in the script
[16:51:39] <danheberden> i just replied, not as good idea as i thought
[16:51:58] <danheberden> setenv will probably work best for anyone for local testing too, because they can either chnge that in the script or set one up in their own host
[16:52:15] <danheberden> oh, shoot, but that's only in control
[16:52:23] <danheberden> ugh - i wish there was a cleaner way to do this
[16:52:42] <danheberden> i'm just gonna go with whatever y'all want, how about that :p
[16:52:50] <danheberden> i'm just making this more confusing
[17:01:57] <johnbender> danheberden: tbenzige: I'll state this here though it's not particularly important
[17:02:08] <johnbender> my preference is to have it in a file outside of php
[17:02:18] <johnbender> so that if you want to use the key for testing on the server it's easier
[17:02:22] <johnbender> plain text is fine
[17:02:32] <johnbender> then after that I would just do a php include
[17:02:37] <johnbender> and then htaccess
[17:02:44] <johnbender> I think just one if fine
[17:03:17] <johnbender> I might be misunderstanding the hangup though
[17:03:20] <johnbender> so feel free to disregard
[17:03:48] <tbenzige> johnbender: just to clarify...
[17:04:38] <tbenzige> the kuler-api-key.php is still in the repo for others to edit when testing it themselves
[17:04:56] <tbenzige> the env var is used on the server, so the key is not lost everytime we pull from github onto the server
[17:09:36] <johnbender> sigh
[17:26:23] <danheberden> we can do a file, but it'll be two levels deep to not be exposed publicly - like i said, whatevs y'all want
[17:43:18] <johnbender> danheberden: we can exclude the whole config/ subdir
[17:43:19] <johnbender> where exclude means permission for internal use only
