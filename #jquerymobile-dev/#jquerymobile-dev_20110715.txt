[08:13:46] <scottjehl> mornin
[08:23:57] <scottjehl> hey _nickel
[08:33:46] <scottjehl>  Wilto!
[08:33:59] <Wilto> Whatup.
[08:47:46] <gseguin> mornin'
[08:48:02] <scottjehl> hey gseguin
[08:48:22] <scottjehl> sorry I had to leave last night - did you get any further with transitions?
[08:49:13] <gseguin> no worries
[08:49:24] <gseguin> not really :(
[08:49:42] <gseguin> the flashing happens on iPhone, not on iPad
[08:51:17] <scottjehl> k
[08:51:27] <scottjehl> I have time to look at it with you today if you want
[08:55:49] <gseguin> I have to deal with Jive stuff today
[08:57:07] <scottjehl> ok. well, I'll jump in and get acquainted with what you've done so far then
[08:57:27] <scottjehl> mostly, the JS part, as the CSS looked very clear
[08:57:58] <gseguin> the JS part is straight from a comment on an issue
[08:58:20] <gseguin> the only thing I've changed are the timeouts
[09:00:59] <gseguin> scottjehl: I just push a very minor change (formatting)
[09:09:35] <scottjehl> ok. yeah I was wondering about the timeouts
[09:09:51] <scottjehl> master doesn't use any right?
[09:09:57] <scottjehl> but we need them with transitions?
[09:13:33] <gseguin> so the timeout in the else I think is so the no-effect transition takes the same time as the one with effect
[09:14:10] <gseguin> the one in the else I was just starting to look into why it was there
[10:41:05] <toddparker> working o hte change list for this week blog post. very productive week guys!
[10:47:28] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: going to work on the dialog issue
[10:47:36] <_nickel> finally ...
[10:47:40] <scottjehl> awesome!!!
[10:48:18] <_nickel> also I gave my presentation on Functors last night and it went really really really well
[10:48:25] <scottjehl> last night I had a dream where I was chased down the road by people with pitchforks shouting "Build failed in Hudson!!!"
[10:48:32] <_nickel> scottjehl: hahah
[10:48:44] <gseguin> :)
[10:48:51] <_nickel> thats one form of encouragement I suppose :D
[10:49:00] <scottjehl> oh man, awesome to hear _nickel
[10:49:07] <_nickel> scottjehl: I hope they accept for jqcon
[10:49:12] <_nickel> I would love to give that talk
[10:49:21] * _nickel is extremely passionate about functional programming
[10:49:26] <scottjehl> I read your article. Tried to follow as best I could, but my familiarity with the other languages was limiting
[10:49:42] <scottjehl> yeah I hope you get in for it - that'd be great
[10:49:43] <_nickel> for a presentation it works really well because I can walk you through it verbally
[13:09:33] <scottjehl> hey _nickel
[13:09:52] <scottjehl> would you have a sec to review this? I't's pretty quick I think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/prefetch-new
[13:10:03] <scottjehl> or anyone here would be great :)
[13:10:03] <gseguin> scottjehl: any luck with the transitions?
[13:10:10] <scottjehl> looking at that now
[13:12:18] <gseguin> ok
[13:15:53] <scottjehl> gseguin, would you have a minute to look at that link?
[13:16:08] <gseguin> scottjehl: sure
[13:21:30] <gseguin> scottjehl:  it looks good to me
[13:22:12] <scottjehl> thanks for reviewing
[13:22:16] <scottjehl> pretty small diff overall
[13:22:32] <gseguin> if you want to save a few bytes, you can use "~$.inArray( url, urls )" instead of "$.inArray( url, urls ) === -1"
[13:23:22] <gseguin> I just read a presentation on JS operators recently, this one seemed like nice one
[13:24:23] <gseguin> scottjehl: sorry, read "!~$.inArray( url, urls )"
[13:26:12] <scottjehl> oh nice idea
[13:26:19] <scottjehl> yeah, comes down to readability I guess
[13:26:56] <scottjehl> I'd be fine with that change if you think it won't throw people off
[13:27:53] <gseguin> question is, does the minifier do that for us
[13:28:15] <gseguin> if that's the case, then we can keep it as === -1 for readability
[13:30:35] <scottjehl> not sure
[13:30:42] <scottjehl> I'm about the merge the branch into master but feel free to get in there and make the change if you'd like
[13:31:42] <gseguin> there are 7 other candidates for that change in the code
[13:32:04] <gseguin> I can do them all at once when I've got a little time
[13:41:35] <scottjehl> k. actually, you know. That's probably a styleguide question
[13:41:50] <scottjehl> http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[13:43:23] <scottjehl> landed, btw.
[13:43:29] <scottjehl> data-prefetch
[13:43:40] <gseguin> it doesn't look like it's against the guidelines
[13:43:55] <gseguin> yeah I saw the hudson email ;)
[13:44:18] <gseguin> that's great! thanks Scott
[14:14:12] <scottjehl> _nickel, you there?
[14:14:24] <scottjehl> wondering if you found anything interesting with the unit test failure
[14:14:27] <_nickel> scottjehl: I did
[14:14:34] <_nickel> well we know there's at least one problem
[14:15:10] <_nickel> scottjehl: my company took me out to lunch to I've been out for a few hours
[14:15:13] <_nickel> but I think I'm closing in on the issue
[14:15:32] <scottjehl> oh cool - no rush was just curious
[14:15:32] <_nickel> also added the decorate helper to the test suite
[14:15:40] <_nickel> so that we can monkey patch funtions for testing
[14:15:48] <_nickel> *functions
[14:16:11] <scottjehl> that's helpful
[14:16:20] <scottjehl> cool
[14:16:20] <_nickel> one of the annoying bits is that the dialog is coming up with what looks like a custom close button
[14:16:28] <_nickel> thats where I'm working now
[14:16:35] <_nickel> trying to figure out why that is
[14:24:29] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/07/15/mobile-team-update-week-of-july-11th/
[14:24:40] <toddparker> nice work guys: https://twitter.com/#!/mustpax/status/91931438890496000
[14:25:07] <gseguin> Nice article, as usual Todd
[14:26:14] <gseguin> toddparker: I wanted to fix a typo but I can't login anymore (or I've forgotten how to)
[14:26:48] <scottjehl> epic post
[14:27:24] <scottjehl> what he said. that was nice
[15:13:04] <gseguin> toddparker: ping
[15:14:33] <gseguin> scottjehl: you there?
[15:15:07] <scottjehl> i'm still here ya
[15:15:16] * gseguin <embarassed>
[15:15:31] <gseguin> I think I screwed up the layout of the blog post
[15:15:38] <scottjehl> ruh roh
[15:15:43] <gseguin> but really, all I did was fixing a typo
[15:15:56] <gseguin> and it looks ok in edit mode
[15:16:07] <gseguin> I have no idea what happened
[15:18:02] <scottjehl> huh
[15:19:37] <gseguin> ?
[15:20:59] <scottjehl> there may be a way to roll it back
[15:21:08] <gseguin> that's what I was looking for
[15:21:19] <gseguin> but I couldn't find it
[15:21:53] <gseguin> I feel really bad, I'm sorry
[15:22:01] <scottjehl> ha no worries!
[15:22:09] <scottjehl> i think the options are hidden for revisions
[15:22:11] <scottjehl> one sec
[15:22:28] <scottjehl> did you change a lot?
[15:22:32] <scottjehl> i can roll it back otherwise
[15:22:45] <gseguin> 2 typos
[15:22:50] <gseguin> no big deal
[15:23:00] <gseguin> just wanted to make it even more perfect
[15:30:54] <scottjehl> :)
[15:30:58] <scottjehl> so I think it's restored
[15:38:31] <scottjehl> gotta run!
[15:53:12] <gseguin> ?tell scottjehl: That fixed it. Thank you! You'll have to tell me how you did it.
[15:53:12] <bot-t> gseguin, Okay.
