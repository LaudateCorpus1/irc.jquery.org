[00:42:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to popup-simple: http://git.io/hW8jZw
[00:42:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-simple] two comments on mutex and open concerns - John Bender
[07:11:20] <Wilto> What am I having opinions about now?
[07:18:25] <Wilto> Pepsi > Coke; Wars > Trek; Tabs > Spaces
[07:18:33] <Wilto> That should cover most of them.
[07:20:52] <toddparker> johnbender: wilt and I will test that branch now
[07:20:52] <bot-t> (12 hours 50 mins ago) <johnbender> tell toddparker you guys can start testing on jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-simple/ though I would still consider this a first pass (all the tests are green)
[07:20:53] <bot-t> (12 hours 30 mins ago) <johnbender> tell toddparker one thing that's not working is the refocusing of links on the close of the popup, I still have that as a todo
[07:20:53] <bot-t> (12 hours 30 mins ago) <johnbender> tell toddparker I plan to go through the list of issues in the changelog you sent me to make sure those things are working
[07:20:55] <toddparker> short url: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-simple/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[07:20:58] <toddparker> oops
[07:21:06] <toddparker> http://bit.ly/Q9aGJI
[07:22:31] <toddparker> that is a cap I
[07:33:25] <toddparker> testing now. looking good in Android 4.1 and 4.0
[07:33:33] <toddparker> one bug - uGoMobi, you here?
[07:51:37] <toddparker> johnbender: i don't know if we need refocusing of links
[07:53:35] <Wilto> johnbender: A-testin’ I will go.
[07:53:42] <Wilto> johnbender: I’ll jot down my findings in https://etherpad.mozilla.org/dIepETgHc9
[08:00:20] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I am here
[08:07:17] <gnarf> gseguin: if you float through today, ping me
[08:32:50] <toddparker> oh, uGoMobi - ran into a bug you might want to look at
[08:32:51] <toddparker> Android 4.0.4 - Chrome (18.0)
[08:32:51] <toddparker> On the photo "photo scaling" and "iframe" images demos, overlay is over the photo
[08:36:36] <toddparker> odd, huh
[08:36:48] <toddparker> i've heard reports that happens with the fixed toolbars in play
[08:36:52] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I will look at it this weekend together with the other Chrome for Android bug
[08:36:55] <toddparker> k
[08:37:35] <uGoMobi> yeah, seems related to fixed/absolute positioning
[08:39:42] <uGoMobi> toddparker: the popup container isn't nested in popup screen, they are siblings
[08:40:16] <uGoMobi> z-index should take care of the stack order
[08:50:55] <gseguin> gnarf: ping
[08:51:18] <gnarf> gseguin: http://jq02.stage.jquery.com:3100
[08:51:20] <gnarf> seems broken
[08:51:21] <gnarf> not sure why
[08:51:29] <gnarf> my attempts to debug were frustrating
[08:51:29] <gseguin> why?
[08:51:42] <gnarf> check one of the "priming" urls you told me about
[08:51:51] <gnarf> it doesn't say "OK"
[08:51:57] <gseguin> hmm
[08:52:06] <gseguin> did you create the directories?
[08:52:11] <gnarf> i think so
[08:52:18] <gnarf> can you ssh gseguin@jq02.stage.jquery.com
[08:52:18] <gseguin> did you set the env vars?
[08:52:35] <gnarf> gseguin: I believe so - there were more annoying errors before
[08:52:43] <gnarf> and i had a permissions issue once and the dir was correct
[08:52:45] <gnarf> so yes
[08:52:50] <gnarf> ENV vars check
[08:53:05] <gnarf> its in /var/www/amd-builder.jquerymobile.com
[08:53:14] <gnarf> can you double check me
[08:53:17] <gnarf> and lemme know what i broke?
[08:53:18] <gnarf> :)
[08:53:42] <gseguin> will do
[08:54:16] <gnarf> also
[08:54:22] <gnarf>  /etc/init.d/amd-builder
[08:54:27] <gnarf> start/stop/restart
[08:54:45] <gnarf> and sudo -u www-data when executing
[08:54:54] <gnarf> if you debug
[08:55:54] <gnarf> also, agcolom - you here? any chance you have something to push to api.jquerymobile.com today? I want to see if it deploys correctly
[09:00:42] <gseguin> agcolom is on vacation
[09:03:48] <johnbender> Wilto: checking your notes
[09:04:07] <Wilto> johnbender: Not a lot to see just yet.
[09:04:58] <johnbender> Wilto: do those issues exist on master?
[09:05:06] <Wilto> Haven’t confirmed yet, but I will.
[09:05:12] <johnbender> Wilto: cool thanks
[09:05:14] <Wilto> I mind less if we’re consistently busted.
[09:05:21] <johnbender> Wilto: indeed
[09:05:23] <Wilto> I wouldn’t tackle any of it just yet, y’know.
[09:05:48] <johnbender> Wilto: most of the issues you describe are parts of it that I haven't touched but that doesn't mean I haven't affected them
[09:08:51] <johnbender> toddparker: I was going to ask about the link refocusnig
[09:09:04] <johnbender> toddparker: that's what causes the focus highlight stick in WP7
[09:09:14] <johnbender> if we take that out it's all good
[09:09:46] <johnbender> the link focus issues that is
[09:10:35] <Wilto> Yeah, we were talking about this earlier. I’m fine with removing it too.
[09:11:05] <Wilto> I’m not really seeing where there’s a ton of benefit to the user there.
[09:11:27] <Wilto> I get the reasoning, but I don’t think anyone’s gonna be like “HEY WHERE’D MY FOCUS GO ON THAT BUTTON.”
[09:11:49] <johnbender> that's exactly what I thought last night
[09:13:28] <Wilto> IT IS DECIDED
[09:13:38] <Wilto> Lemme go find Todd’s gavel; brb.
[09:15:53] <gseguin> gnarf: "path.exists is now called `fs.exists`."
[09:16:01] <Wilto> ?TWSOA
[09:16:01] <bot-t> The Wilto Seal of Approval™
[09:16:32] <gseguin> I'll change that
[09:20:20] <johnbender> Wilto: I did see that blue flash before the popup is visible
[09:20:30] <johnbender> Wilto: it only seems to happen once
[09:20:49] <Wilto> Yeah. My guess is that it’s focusing before things are actually drawn on the screen, which is a very Android sort of bug.
[09:21:32] <johnbender> Wilto: yah the ui-popup-active is only applied after animation complete :(
[09:21:48] <Wilto> Android is such a dingus about focus.
[09:23:23] <gseguin> gnarf: should I be worried about: "Directory /usr/local/var/run does not exist. Modify the 'amd-builder' init.d script (/etc/init.d/amd-builder) accordingly"
[09:23:42] <gnarf> gseguin: run /etc/init.d as root
[09:23:54] <gnarf> if you were manually running the node server.js , use www-data
[09:23:55] <gseguin> ha
[09:24:18] <gnarf> gseguin: because www-data owns all that stuff
[09:24:22] <gnarf> or just remember to chown it all
[09:24:23] <gnarf> :)
[09:24:36] <gseguin> k
[09:27:32] <johnbender> Wilto: what's reason for foucsing the container?
[09:27:39] <johnbender> accessibility?
[09:27:44] <gseguin> gnarf: do we capture the console output somewhere?
[09:28:06] <gnarf> gseguin: nope, start-stop-daemon does nothing with the output
[09:28:13] <gseguin> arg
[09:28:16] <gseguin> ok
[09:28:22] <johnbender> Wilto: with a timeout on the focus I can't reproduce :/
[09:28:24] <Wilto> johnbender: Yeeeah, that does kinda make sense, a11y-wise.
[09:28:34] <Wilto> Like, a timeout of 0?
[09:28:41] <gnarf> gseguin: all the services scott_gonzalez and I have been writing have been using https://github.com/jquery/node-logger
[09:28:41] <johnbender> 100ms
[09:28:44] <gnarf> to log to syslog
[09:28:45] <johnbender> haven't tried anything smaller
[09:29:04] <gseguin> gnarf: yeah I totally failed on logging
[09:29:06] <Wilto> …If 0 doesn’t mysteriously do it—and it might—I’m honestly okay with the slight delay.
[09:29:12] <gseguin> I'll improve that shortly
[09:29:20] <gnarf> gseguin: couple of requests then
[09:29:33] <gnarf> can you make it args using optimist for the config options?
[09:29:38] <gnarf> way easier than ENV=
[09:29:46] <gseguin> sure
[09:30:14] <gnarf> gseguin: https://github.com/gnarf37/node-notifier-server/blob/master/notifier-server.js#L4-18
[09:30:36] <gseguin> yup
[09:31:09] <johnbender> Wilto: min timeout works
[09:31:19] <johnbender> Wilto: lets the afteropen even stack unwind
[09:31:32] <johnbender> I might try binding to afteropen
[09:31:45] <johnbender> less "whenever" and more deterministic
[09:31:51] <gnarf> gseguin: if you add a post-receive webhook to your repo pointing at http://jq02.stage.jquery.com:3333
[09:31:59] <gnarf> gseguin: then it will update if you push
[09:32:05] <johnbender> though I can see people expecting the container to be focused before afteropen is fired
[09:32:19] <gseguin> gnarf: FAN-TAS-TIC
[09:32:25] <gnarf> gseguin: stage takes whatever is on master, live will take anything tagged with a version number
[09:32:36] <gnarf> literally tag.match(/\d\.\d/)
[09:32:45] <gseguin> gnarf: great
[09:32:57] <gnarf> obvs, you need jq02.jquery.com:3333 too
[09:33:00] <gnarf> once thats running
[09:33:44] <gnarf> gseguin: also, whats the reasoning behind needing to create the branch directories
[09:34:13] <gnarf> gseguin: like why shouldn't it work with any branch/tag that supports amd ?
[09:34:16] <gseguin> gnarf: control manually which branch you expose
[09:35:02] <gnarf> gseguin: is there a reason to not expose one?
[09:35:15] <gnarf> (unless it doesn't support amd builder)
[09:35:20] <gseguin> hmm not really
[09:36:05] <gseguin> I'll file issues and get to it asap
[09:36:15] <gseguin> I have to go back to my day job
[09:36:23] <gnarf> gseguin: also, do you know if the webhook will work if i do http://jquerymobile.com/amd-builder/post-receive ?
[09:36:31] <gnarf> from jquery/jquery-mobile
[09:36:52] <gseguin> gnarf: it should
[09:37:07] <gseguin> gnarf: thanks for all the good suggestions
[09:37:12] <gnarf> no prob
[09:37:43] <gnarf> once you do the args switch, ill need to make a quick change in puppet
[09:38:00] <gnarf> so maybe have it default to process.env._____
[09:39:54] <gseguin> ok, I'll keep you posted
[09:40:14] <gseguin> gnarf: not sure when I'll get to it, busy weekend ahead
[09:40:32] <gnarf> gseguin: not in a rush for anything other than it working properly :)
[09:55:48] <Wilto> johnbender: Yeah, that makes sense.
[09:55:59] <Wilto> Were you still seeing that focus issue on master, as well
[09:56:00] <Wilto> ?
[09:56:22] <johnbender> Wilto: yes
[09:56:32] <johnbender> Wilto: let me double check
[09:56:47] <Wilto> I wasn’t seeing it, but I can double-back and recheck if you are.
[09:57:18] <johnbender> Wilto: it may be that there's just less code between open and the focus
[09:57:27] <johnbender> leaving time for the animation to complete
[09:57:30] <johnbender> err
[09:57:38] <johnbender> not leaving enough time for the animation to complete
[09:57:49] <toddparker> i'm ok with nixing the focus
[09:57:53] <johnbender> Wilto: or it could be that he had something in there to unwind the stack
[09:58:05] <johnbender> toddparker: just about to push that change after I add this test
[09:58:17] <johnbender> and the fix for the focus weirdness on android
[09:58:52] <toddparker> ok
[09:58:58] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm not seeing it on master
[09:59:02] <toddparker> cranking along!
[09:59:21] <johnbender> Wilto: once I push this test to  the branch I'll take a look and see if there's something other than "more code" that would explain it
[09:59:35] <Wilto> If it’s just more code, add a couple hundred semicolons in there.
[09:59:38] <Wilto> ?cc
[09:59:38] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[09:59:40] <johnbender> Wilto: the animation engine runs parallel to the javascript thread so it's possible that it was just taking longer to resolve
[10:00:05] <johnbender> or I assume it does
[10:00:10] <johnbender> o.o
[10:01:06] <Wilto> Who knows, in this mixed-up world of ours.
[10:01:09] <Wilto> (I have no idea.)
[10:02:41] <johnbender> toddparker: have you taken a look at the list of things Wilto has found?
[10:04:03] <johnbender> Wilto: well I'm glad this is all on master :)
[10:04:18] <johnbender> sort of
[10:04:20] <johnbender> :/
[10:04:32] <Wilto> “No news is good news.”
[10:05:23] <Wilto> WP scrolling issues are identical between the two, which is… “Good” too.
[10:05:30] <johnbender> yah
[10:05:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to popup-simple: http://git.io/LOTmyA
[10:05:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-simple] remove link focus, unwind stack before applying focus and tab index - John Bender
[10:06:43] <Wilto> Shout-out to fake Etherpad names.
[10:08:09] <johnbender> Wilto: I pushed my "fix" for the focus
[10:08:41] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: did you guys discuss the possibility of animating the screen as the exact viewport size and then resizing after the animation?
[10:08:54] <johnbender> to speed it up?
[10:09:50] <Wilto> No indeed.
[10:10:45] <Wilto> But this idea intrigues me and I would like to subscribe to your newsletter.
[10:11:15] <Wilto> Also, should I just get after these bugs?
[10:11:42] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm about to run to the gym so feel free
[10:11:46] <johnbender> the branch is popup-simple
[10:11:52] <johnbender> I'll ping you when I get back so we can stay in touch
[10:13:32] <Wilto> Cool, cool. I’m grabbing lunch in a few anyway; we’ll reconvene shortly.
[11:12:57] <Wilto> johnbender: Back whenever you are.
[11:18:57] <Wilto> Gonna sort that z-index issue real quick.
[11:46:52] <Wilto> Okay, git question. Anyone around?
[11:49:07] <Wilto> gseguin, actually, this might be one for you.
[11:49:19] <gseguin> hehsure
[11:49:37] <gseguin> go for it
[11:49:41] <Wilto> modified:   js/jquery-1.8.0.js
[11:49:41] <Wilto> modified:   js/jquery.js
[11:49:58] <Wilto> I check them out, they stay “modified.” I remove them, “modified.” I stash “modified.”
[11:50:21] <gseguin> hmm
[11:50:23] <Wilto> Delete them and pull, they get put back and flagged as “modified.”
[11:51:14] <gseguin> and that's all that's marked modified in your tree?
[11:51:20] <Wilto> Yeah.
[11:51:32] <Wilto> Did you remove or add those files during your core stuff?
[11:51:41] <Wilto> I’ll just, uh, do what you did and commit it, I guess?
[11:52:46] <gseguin> I added  js/jquery-1.8.0.js
[11:52:55] <gseguin> and modified js/jquery.js
[11:53:30] <gseguin> did you try doing `git checkout -- .`
[11:53:38] <Wilto> Diff gives me the entirety of both files.
[11:54:01] <Wilto> git checkout --
[11:54:01] <Wilto> M	js/jquery-1.8.0.js
[11:54:01] <Wilto> M	js/jquery.js
[11:54:09] <Wilto> Status immediately after:
[11:54:12] <Wilto> modified:   js/jquery-1.8.0.js
[11:54:13] <Wilto> modified:   js/jquery.js
[11:54:27] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/AAARGH.gif
[11:54:29] <gseguin> how about: git reset
[11:55:37] <Wilto> git reset --hard head
[11:55:38] <gseguin> should unstage them
[11:55:39] <Wilto> Same.
[11:56:06] <gseguin> then git checkout --
[11:56:26] <Wilto> Annnd same.
[11:56:32] <Wilto> This is weird, right? This isn’t just me?
[11:56:36] <Wilto> I’ve never seen this happen before.
[11:56:48] <gseguin> it is
[11:56:57] <Wilto> …I might just commit it and see what happens.
[11:57:09] <gseguin> I mean the easy answer would be: "it must be you"
[11:57:41] <Wilto> somehow i’ve known it was my fault all along
[11:57:53] <Wilto> Okay, what the hell.
[11:57:56] <gseguin> but it's weird that reset & checkout don't get rid of it
[11:58:06] <Wilto> Reset to a commit from yesterday, fetched, rebased. There they are again.
[11:58:32] <gseguin> paging Dr Bender
[11:58:41] <gseguin> johnbender: ^^
[11:59:13] <gseguin> sorry Wilto, I don't know what to say here
[11:59:24] <Wilto> Should I punch something Y/N_
[11:59:40] * gseguin is far enough
[11:59:41] <gseguin> Y
[12:00:16] <Wilto> ON IT
[12:01:14] <gseguin> just commit and push
[12:01:18] <gseguin> we'll fix it
[12:01:19] <Wilto> WHAT COULD GO WRONG
[12:01:25] <gseguin> tm
[12:05:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/xnyEyw
[12:05:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Hi, haters. - Mat Marquis
[12:05:11] <Wilto> So yeah.
[12:05:30] <Wilto> …I guess I didn’t have to push that, did I.
[12:05:36] <Wilto>  2 files changed, 2920 insertions(+), 2920 deletions(-)
[12:05:43] <Wilto> And everything seems fine here, so…
[12:08:09] <Wilto> We could’ve nuked that commit if I hadn’t pushed, huh.
[12:11:37] <Wilto> Everything seem okay to you, gseguin?
[12:34:48] <gseguin> lemme check
[12:35:17] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin whats up
[12:35:37] <johnbender> gseguin: you'll  have to wait on the Dr prefix for about 5-6 years at best :P
[12:35:55] <gseguin> heh
[12:36:17] <johnbender> Nice!
[12:36:22] <gseguin> Wilto was having a http://wil.to/_/AAARGH.gif moment with git
[12:36:35] <johnbender> just got an email saying that I've wont 920,000 dollars from exxon mobile promotions
[12:37:13] <gseguin> not enough for an island
[12:37:21] <johnbender> sadly
[12:37:33] <johnbender> that will ahve to wait another 20-30 years at best
[12:42:04] <johnbender> Wilto: how are you feeling about the popup-simple branch?
[12:44:09] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker: Wilto: SUCK IT TREBEC! http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/08/a-worthy-ultrabook-appears-the-thinkpad-x1-carbon-reviewed/
[13:14:33] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm not convinced that "mailto:" issue is actually an issue
[13:18:15] <johnbender> Wilto: nevermind
[13:22:24] <johnbender> Wilto solved
[13:34:55] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4883
[13:49:25] <Wilto> So.
[13:49:45] <Wilto> I have learned something today, while attempting to fix the “simple z-index issue in Android Chrome.”
[13:50:01] <Wilto> If you keyframe-animate the opacity of an absolute positioned element in Chrome for Android, it disregards z-indices and puts it above everything else on the page.
[13:50:20] <Wilto> Since we’re animating the backdrop and not the popup itself: sucks to be the popup itself.
[13:50:53] <Wilto> johnbender: Oh damn, good catch/
[14:23:14] <johnbender> Wilto: so have you found anything that's not already on master?
[14:24:56] <johnbender> Wilto: otherwise I'm going to work on opting ie7 out of the history management
[14:33:33] <Wilto> Honestly dude, I’ve been testing the hell out of this stuff and I’m not finding anything beyond what’s in the Etherpad.
[14:33:44] <Wilto> I’d say go for it.
[14:33:44] * johnbender raises the roof
[14:33:45] <johnbender> nice
[14:33:58] <Wilto> I wouldn’t be spending so much time on this “z-index” issue if it weren’t so friggin’ terrifying.
[14:34:22] <Wilto> Doing a test case now. I dunno what outcome I’m hoping for.
[14:50:25] <Wilto> jkldsajkfdjsnac
[14:50:30] <Wilto> TODAY IS GOING SWELL
[15:03:05] <Wilto> I give up. CSS wins.
[15:03:13] <Wilto> You guys have a good weekend; I’ll try this again Monday.
[15:03:58] <johnbender> Wilto: have a good one budy
[15:04:36] <Wilto> johnbender: I’ve been narrowing it down, and it looks like keyframe animating opacity _always_ puts that element on a topmost “z-index.”
[15:04:43] <Wilto> But I can’t reproduce it in a test case.
[15:04:48] <johnbender> Wilto: :(
[15:04:53] <Wilto> If I fade in both, fine. If I fade in neither, fine.
[15:04:59] <johnbender> Wilto: that's the worste
[15:05:00] <johnbender> -e
[15:05:10] <Wilto> Fade just the popup, also no problem. It’s baffling.
