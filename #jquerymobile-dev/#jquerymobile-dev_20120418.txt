[07:30:00] <deAtog> I reissued this one on a new repository/branch: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4107
[07:30:01] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by deAtog (2m, 57s ago): Fix for issue #3347 - pagebeforechange being called twice
[08:07:38] <deAtog> ping gseguin
[08:17:11] <deAtog> ping johnbender
[08:22:38] <deAtog> hey kinblas
[08:24:30] <kinblas> deAtog: hey
[08:32:10] <deAtog> I issued a pull request for issues 3939 and 3980
[08:36:16] <kinblas> deAtog: ew, pushstate stuff ... johnbender is probably the better person to look at that since he spent a lot of time massaging that code to work on multiple platforms
[08:36:38] <kinblas> deAtog: did you and gseguin talk about your other patch?
[08:37:25] <kinblas> deAtog: I haven't had the chance to look at it in detail, but splitting changePage, makes sense but worries me in terms of how people have been using/relying on the current behavior
[08:38:00] <kinblas> some folks want to catch a changepage request while it is a string so they can prevent it entirely
[08:38:26] <kinblas> or change the url being requested
[08:38:33] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:38:49] <gseguin> hey deAtog, will look at your patch shortly
[08:38:54] <kinblas> you would think that you could do this in a loadpage request but load page also gets used by the pre-loader
[08:39:53] <kinblas> so if folks decide the split is necessary then we'll need to insure that we indicate on the loadpage request that it was triggered by a changepage.
[08:42:00] <kinblas> also some other uses for catching the string based change page request is for folks to parse out/remove the query params/state they pushed into the URL so they can re-use the same pages
[08:42:02] <deAtog> kinblas: from all the example I've seen most people only care about handling the case when beforepagechange's toPage is a string
[08:42:36] <kinblas> deAtog: on initial loading of the document, I believe changePage could be called with a node
[08:42:41] <deAtog> once it's an object, it's already too late the page has already been fetched
[08:43:12] <deAtog> beforechangepage isn't called in that case
[08:43:29] <deAtog> if I recall correctly that is..
[08:43:40] <kinblas> actually it does get called in both cases
[08:43:54] <kinblas> isn't that the reason why folks were saying it gets called twice?
[08:44:48] <deAtog> right.. it gets called when user's click a link.. that causes loadPage to happen .. which then calls changePage again with the new object
[08:46:15] <deAtog> if the page is already in the DOM.. then all this happens rather quickly.. but when the page isn't in the DOM then the page is actually fetched via Ajax and loaded into the DOM before the call to changePage happens again
[08:46:40] <deAtog> only when stuff is loaded via Ajax do the load events fire..
[08:47:16] <deAtog> so in that case if they want/need to do something once it is loaded they should use the load events
[08:47:19] <kinblas> deAtog: right ... the load events are meant to indicate that the page in question is going to be fetched and not already in the DOM
[08:48:14] <kinblas> deAtog: how does your change affect the case where folks are using different urls but re-using the same internal pages already in the DOM?
[08:49:27] <deAtog> the only case that happens is during a backwards transition from a page to the first page..
[08:49:53] <kinblas> ??
[08:50:21] <deAtog> pages are removed from the DOM after a transition..
[08:50:29] <deAtog> the only page that isn't is the first page
[08:51:22] <kinblas> deAtog: that is all controlled by a config option and an attribute, so things can be cached, and folks out there do take advantage of it for the reasons I mentioned above ... so those have to be factored in
[08:51:43] <kinblas> also, pages that start out in the document also are not pruned, unless johnbender/gseguin have change something post 1.0
[08:52:15] <deAtog> I haven't tested cached pages
[08:52:52] <kinblas> btw, just so we're clear, I'm not opposed to your patch necessarily I just want to know what the impact is on different cases, because this is a change in behavior and inevitably someone will complain that we've changed it
[08:52:53] <gseguin> I don't think that it changed
[08:53:37] <kinblas> gseguin: you mean the pruning strategy right?
[08:53:45] <gseguin> yeah
[08:54:49] <deAtog> yeah.. I agree I didn't see any pruning going on..
[08:56:14] <deAtog> I'm going to go to lunch.. I'll be back in about an hour
[09:05:14] <johnbender> kinblas: deAtog: yah I'm planning to look at that once I get my preso finished
[09:15:43] <johnbender> deAtog: I commented on the pr, the commit you reverted was in there for a reason but that doesn't mean your fix won't work

[10:52:50] <gseguin> johnbender: I think toddparker tagged them with docs-1.1.1 if they need to be cherry-picked
[10:53:21] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't see any tagged like that after 1.1-stable
[10:53:52] <johnbender> gseguin: maybe I don't know what you mean tagged. Like "[tagged] in the commit message"
[10:54:07] <gseguin> hmm I thought I saw one of his messages yesterday saying that (did I day dream?)

[10:56:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #4093 from MauriceG/patch-41 - Todd Parker
[10:56:19] <deAtog> johnbender: do you have a browser known to cause issues with the old method?
[10:56:25] <johnbender> deAtog: android
[10:56:29] <johnbender> 2.2
[10:56:31] <johnbender> as I recall
[10:56:34] <johnbender> either way it'
[10:56:46] <johnbender> it's silly to stick an arbitrary timeout in there if we can avoid it
[10:56:57] <deAtog> hrm.. that's the one I've primarily been testing against..
[10:57:03] <johnbender> if we get to the point where we can't sort out the current solution then I think it's worth reverting
[10:57:06] <johnbender> but the old way is broken
[10:57:28] <johnbender> it's also non deterministic
[10:57:39] <johnbender> how can you say for sure that 100ms is enough
[10:57:45] <deAtog> no matter what you do.. you're going to have to use setTimeout in there..
[10:57:49] <johnbender> ?
[10:57:51] <johnbender> how do you figure
[10:58:20] <johnbender> I haven't attempted to address the current issue so I don't know for sure but I'm going to try before throwing in the towel
[10:58:32] <johnbender> I'll leave the pr open for now though
[10:59:17] <deAtog> JavaScript is single threaded, so things get scheduled to run in a particular order when time is available
[10:59:52] <johnbender> deAtog: we have no control over when the browser fires the "hashchange"
[10:59:52] <deAtog> the issue on Android and older Webkit browsers is that the hashchange event is already scheduled at the start of the popstate event
[11:00:15] <johnbender> and we've seen it go as late as 100+ms
[11:00:31] <johnbender> as a result, we know that setting a timout in there does not solve the problem for all cases
[11:00:39] <johnbender> I don't know how else to describe that
[11:00:48] <deAtog> I understand that..
[11:01:09] <deAtog> the issue though.. is that the popstate event itself can generate another hashchange event
[11:01:17] <johnbender> that was the reason for the original timeout!
[11:01:39] <deAtog> right
[11:01:43] * johnbender has brought his exclamation points to the discussion
[11:02:22] <deAtog> ok.. how do I explain this in another way..
[11:02:54] <johnbender> it's also the reason for the current check between the two states for an upcoming hashchange
[11:03:04] <johnbender> they are intended to accomplish the same task
[11:03:13] <deAtog> right.. but they don't
[11:03:28] <johnbender> neither of them  do
[11:03:49] <johnbender> so if I have to choose between fixing one or the other I'd rather try with the one that doesn't introduce an arbitrary timeout
[11:04:09] <deAtog> 0 isn't really arbitrary
[11:04:30] <deAtog> 0 says run this immediately when you have time
[11:05:01] <johnbender> deAtog: I just told you  that the hashchange can run as much as 100ms after the popstate gets fired
[11:05:09] <johnbender> how does the 0ms timeout address that
[11:05:25] <johnbender> s/as much as/more than/
[11:05:52] <deAtog> what I'm getting at is I think we might just need to merge the two together..
[11:06:31] <johnbender> deAtog: look, I'm leaving the pull request open. That is, I'm not against going back to the old (imo crazytown) way of doing it
[11:06:41] <johnbender> but I'm not going to merge it in until I've had a look at the issue
[11:06:54] <johnbender> hopefully that will be sometime today or tomorrow
[11:06:59] <johnbender> but it might be as late as next week
[11:07:00] <deAtog> I understand.. we're just talking here
[11:07:53] <deAtog> I'm willing to try and make something that matches your expectations while handling the broken issue in Android..
[11:09:36] <deAtog> in the current code the check for a potential hash change is valid, but I'm not sure it's preventable
[11:09:47] <johnbender> deAtog: if you can take what's there and figure out why it's navigating twice and post it to the issue that would be great
[11:10:46] <deAtog> johnbender: I already figured out why it's navigating twice.. the hashchange event is already on the stack before the popstate event fires even though the popstate event says there will be no hash change
[11:12:15] <deAtog> the _handleHashchange function then creates an additional hashchange event
[11:18:43] <deAtog> the only thing I can think of that could reliably fix this is to completely remove the need for the additional hashchange event firing from the pushstate handler then the hashchange events could be completely disabled until it has completed the page change
[11:19:14] <johnbender> deAtog: I'll have to take a look at why the hashchange is firing when they aren't different
[11:21:01] <deAtog> you can grab a copy of my test app from here: http://desource.dyndns.org/~atog/jqm/
[11:21:15] <johnbender> deAtog: is that posted in the issue?
[11:21:22] <deAtog> nope
[11:21:47] <johnbender> deAtog: if you can that would be helpful it's not guaranteed that I'll be the one to address it so puting the information there is helpful
[11:22:09] <deAtog> it's just a simple multi-page app using code from jquerymobile.com
[11:22:51] <deAtog> there's one page with data-ajax="false" in there as well.. since it seems odd things happen when you get it wrong..
[11:23:20] <johnbender> deAtog: there are popstate bugs associated with navigation across documents that we can't address
[11:23:35] <johnbender> or at least one's that we haven't found a reliable way to address
[11:23:49] <johnbender> if that's the cause then we have other issues to track it
[11:27:02] <gseguin> johnbender: [docs 1.1.1] is the "tag" I wasn't too far off
[11:29:59] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[11:30:06] <johnbender> gseguin: I'd be happy with [1.1.1]
[11:42:26] <toddparker> hi guys
[11:42:42] <gseguin> hey toddparker
[11:42:56] <toddparker> i'll use that tag. all pulls have been tagged that way in the last week
[11:43:06] <toddparker> he gseguin
[11:43:13] <toddparker> so i dropped the ball on the download builder
[11:43:27] <toddparker> is that ready for alpha testers? saw a few issues you were working on
[11:43:44] <gseguin> there is one issue I need to address with the GUI
[11:43:58] <gseguin> other than that I haven't heard anything
[11:44:52] <gseguin> toddparker: I was asking earlier, how do you feel about landing that popup-widget branch into master
[11:45:35] <gseguin> this way we get some feedback from the folks using master
[11:49:43] <deAtog> is there a way to disable page tracking all together?
[11:59:37] <johnbender> deAtog: $.mobile.ajaxEnabled = "false"
[11:59:48] <johnbender> and don't forget the semi lol
[12:01:22] <deAtog> hrm.. not exactly what I was looking for.. I was more or less wondering if pages could be changed without modification of the url..
[12:01:46] <johnbender> not as a setting
[12:01:59] <johnbender> that would break with the progressive enhancement approach
[12:02:33] <deAtog> yeah..
[12:05:19] <deAtog> Everything is starting to make sense to me now.. pushState in jQM as stated in the dos is layered on top of the hashchange event.. so in my example at http://desource.dyndns.org/~atog/jqm/.. going to page two actually puts http://desource.dyndns.org/~atog/jqm/#two.php in the history
[12:05:48] <johnbender> :D
[12:07:27] <deAtog> ok well should have been http://desource.dyndns.org/~atog/jqm/#/~atog/jqm/two.php in the history..
[12:07:36] <deAtog> but same idea..
[12:08:14] <deAtog> I can briefly see that happening in Firefox..
[12:14:35] <deAtog> johnbender: I think this issue may be related to 4980 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4094
[12:14:36] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4094 on jquery-mobile (zpmaxx; 11h, 59m ago): JQM 1.1: Back button fires "pagechange" twice
[12:14:46] <deAtog> er 3980
[12:18:29] <toddparker> gseguin: landing popup would be ok as long as it is in decent shape. i was a bit broken last time i checked but let me review that branch. i know a lot of work has been done recently
[12:19:00] <toddparker> popup or popup-widget branch?
[12:19:07] <toddparker> we need to kill one of those
[12:20:10] <toddparker> popup branch doesn't seems work at all in chrome.
[12:20:35] <toddparker> popup-widget branch works but when you close the popup, it navigates you back
[12:20:41] <toddparker> to a different page
[12:20:59] <toddparker> so i'd say that should need to get that in better shape before we land it
[12:21:16] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: we're looking at popups now
[12:21:25] <toddparker> which branch is the latest? popup or popup-widget?
[12:27:05] <toddparker> gseguin: is the ui issue in the builder the check all/none thing?
[13:05:02] * gseguin is back
[13:05:09] <gseguin> toddparker: popup-widget
[13:05:56] <gseguin> toddparker: builder issue is the check all/none issue logged by tbenzige yesterday

[18:54:18] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (18h, 21m ago): [dialog] Prevent the click-handler for "Close" acting twice
[18:54:26] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|__: maybe you can flag the pulls we need to review for popup and confirm what branch is latest
[19:10:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you have a png version of the jquery logo that's at least 512 px?
[19:10:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: or thereabouts
[19:10:24] <toddmparker_> i do
[19:10:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: nice!
[19:10:43] <toddmparker_> lemme hop on the VPN and grab it
[19:10:47] * johnbender is working on his oopsla poster
[19:10:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: no hurry
[19:10:52] <toddmparker_> wait jQ or jQM
[19:10:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: JQ
[19:10:56] <johnbender> core
[19:11:53] <toddmparker_> ok, lemme look
[19:11:54] <johnbender> I wasn't sure if you guys were involved with that as well
[19:12:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: whenever you have time it's not a massive hurry or anything
[19:13:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: preferably the one with the text below it
[19:13:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ah, and the square one would be best :P
[19:13:14] <johnbender> sorry
[19:13:15] <toddmparker_> being lazy
[19:13:20] <toddmparker_> google image search: http://www.esotech.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/jquery_logo.png
[19:13:50] <toddmparker_> http://wpchannel.com/images/2011/04/jquery-logo.png
[19:14:07] <johnbender> yah that's what I did initially
[19:14:24] <johnbender> the square one in a png is no where to be found
[19:14:35] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll ping you about it tomorrow when you're in the office
[19:14:39] <toddmparker_> ok
[19:14:58] <toddmparker_> but do you just need that 2nd one in a square?
[19:15:03] <toddmparker_> it's 700+ px wide
[19:15:10] <toddmparker_> seems big enough
[20:07:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://webxtreams.net/images/stories/jquery_logo.jpg that one in a png
[20:08:10] <johnbender> should have said that in the first place :(
