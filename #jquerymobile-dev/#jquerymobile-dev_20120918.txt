[02:13:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong!
[02:13:43] <uGoMobi> good morning
[02:25:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[02:26:03] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[02:26:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We need to change the docs ...
[02:26:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi:  "When any link is clicked within a dialog, the framework will automatically close the dialog and transition to the requested page ... "
[02:26:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think it needs to say "any link except a link to another dialog"
[02:27:08] * _|Nix|_ is looking for the issue on this topic ...
[02:27:29] <_|Nix|_> We actually went to great lengths to keep the dialog from closing if the user opens another dialog from it.
[02:27:43] <_|Nix|_> #5003
[02:27:56] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5003
[02:27:59] <uGoMobi> right
[02:28:37] <_|Nix|_> So, the reporter is going to have to write some extra code to get it to work that way.
[02:28:40] <_|Nix|_> Bad UI design, too.
[02:29:00] <_|Nix|_> It's annoying when dialogs go in and out on top of the page.
[02:29:28] <uGoMobi> I agree it is bad UI
[02:29:41] <uGoMobi> was looking at test page of this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4966
[02:30:13] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I saw that too ... we're not reusing the second empty dialog state.
[02:31:05] <_|Nix|_> Not too worried about that though ... I don't think it breaks anything ... the URL is not that important.
[02:31:15] <_|Nix|_> The bottom line is we need to re-write nave.
[02:31:18] <_|Nix|_> s/nave/nav/
[02:32:16] <uGoMobi> because we tell people dialogs are just like pages with some style adjustments we give the impression everything is possible
[02:32:59] <uGoMobi> while the idea of a dialog is open it and then return to the page
[02:34:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, I guess it's not just style adjustments, but also nav adjustments ...
[02:34:54] <uGoMobi> yes
[02:35:01] <uGoMobi> but that's not in the docs
[02:35:22] <_|Nix|_> ... and it should be.
[02:35:37] <uGoMobi> yup
[02:36:06] <uGoMobi> what do you mean by rewrite nav?
[02:36:31] <uGoMobi> talking about the docs or the code?
[02:43:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do we have a clear picture of what does work and what breaks nav?
[02:44:00] <uGoMobi> so we can document that
[02:46:42] <uGoMobi> re-writing nav code is in the roadmap for 1.3, right?
[02:47:39] <_|Nix|_> I dunno ... that's a biggie.
[02:47:46] <uGoMobi> it is
[02:47:54] <_|Nix|_> Well, I just added a functional test for nav.
[02:48:03] <_|Nix|_> You can try clicking around it.
[02:48:10] <uGoMobi> and 1.3 is planned for Q4
[02:48:10] <_|Nix|_> tests/functional/hashchange/hashchange.html
[02:48:18] <_|Nix|_> That soon?
[02:48:42] <uGoMobi> yeah I thought so
[02:49:34] <uGoMobi> anyway, we should discuss what we do want to support when it comes to dialogs and popups etc
[02:50:05] <_|Nix|_> For example, page -> dialog -> dialog <- back -> dialog <- back <- back -> forward -> back results in a state where, if you try to go back, it will not let you.
[02:50:39] <uGoMobi> I am not in favor of adding code to be able to support a bad UI
[02:51:30] <_|Nix|_> No, absolutely not.
[02:51:46] <_|Nix|_> We should, however, document that dialogs are chained by default.
[02:51:47] <uGoMobi> so basically as soon as a second (chained) dialog is in play things become tricky
[02:52:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, the dialog docs have a section about chaining.
[02:52:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That section contradicts the "any link" statement.
[02:52:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll fix the doc and close the bug.
[02:55:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I wouldn't mind if that sections says it is not recommended to chain dialogs
[02:56:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, chaining is not as bad as "swinging" or whatever you wanna call it.
[02:56:56] <_|Nix|_> page -> dialog <- page -automaticall-> dialog <- page is bad.
[02:57:31] <_|Nix|_> page -> dialog1 -> dialog2 <- back <- back is semi-OK.
[02:58:20] <uGoMobi> I agree
[02:59:14] <uGoMobi> but as a user I would expect to go back to the page I came from after clicking anything in a dialog

[05:21:56] <toddmparker_> good morning _|Nix|_

[05:28:27] <toddmparker_> and uGoMobi
[05:28:41] <uGoMobi> good morning toddmparker_
[05:29:20] <toddmparker_> looks like you are close on that bug
[05:29:32] <toddmparker_> i like the frequent bug updates
[05:30:07] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ... and I figured out why #&ui-state=dialog doesn't work in an initial URL.
[05:30:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Really, really funny!
[05:30:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: $( "#&ui-state=dialog:jqmData(role='page')" ) was actually returning non-empty before jQuery 1.8!
[05:31:11] <toddmparker_> I saw johnbender talking about that earlier with dave
[05:31:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: We were blindly passing in the location.has, and it was actually returning something!
[05:31:47] <toddmparker_> funny that a bug in sizzle was making things work for us
[05:31:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Yeah, but this incorrectness was actually making the dialog hash key case work!
[05:31:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Exactly!
[05:32:19] <toddmparker_> guess this is progress
[05:32:23] * _|Nix|_ has since collected his jaw from the floor, but still, it was quite a zinger!

[06:02:10] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: down to 344 issues from 370+ -- kicking butt
[06:05:03] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: question on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5018
[06:05:11] <uGoMobi> I think it's only good if there is a lot of activity on the issue tracker when we about to release a new version
[06:05:31] <uGoMobi> but at some point we have to get the count back to where we were before :)
[06:05:37] <toddmparker_> agreed. people are testing. we caught some nasty bugs
[06:05:47] <uGoMobi> exactly
[06:05:58] <toddmparker_> yeah. i think being agressive about closing wonky bugs with few detail sis great
[06:06:46] <uGoMobi> yes and keep trying to "merge" related tickets
[06:07:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: what did you want to ask about that PR of JasonDScott ?
[06:07:58] <toddmparker_> right.
[06:08:10] <toddmparker_> so just curious about what you're suggesting
[06:08:45] <uGoMobi> in a nutshell... offering the same functionality as JasonDScott suggests but without adding a new option
[06:09:14] <uGoMobi> just make sure it is possible to override the option icon
[06:09:35] <toddmparker_> one thing I was thinking about was if you set the data-icon on the UL/OL, that could essentially override the default icon for that instance. If you set the icon on a LI that should be respected
[06:09:56] <toddmparker_> so same option, but you can put it on the UL or LI
[06:10:21] <toddmparker_> I agree that having a new option isn't what we want
[06:12:01] <uGoMobi> I think we have the same in mind
[06:12:18] <uGoMobi> maybe I didn't explain it well in my comment there
[06:13:24] <uGoMobi> global: set the option as default for all listviews using the $.mobile object
[06:13:24] <uGoMobi> UL: set (or override the default) icon with data-icon on a listview or with the option icon if that listview is created programmatically
[06:13:24] <uGoMobi> LI: override the above for a list item with data-icon on that specific list item
[06:14:06] <uGoMobi> anything set for an UL (data- attribute or option) override the global
[06:14:49] <uGoMobi> anything set for the LI overrides the setting for the UL and/or the global
[06:17:26] <toddmparker_> yep, that sounds like what I had in mind too
[06:17:37] <toddmparker_> cool
[06:18:11] <toddmparker_> it just didn't mention the icon attr on the UL. It talked about doing it via JS
[06:38:10] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_, uGoMobi sounds good. I have the changes done I just want to test them out
[06:41:22] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: ok cool
[06:41:45] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: maybe I still have a JSBin to test this
[06:41:51] <uGoMobi> let me check
[06:45:41] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: here you go http://jsbin.com/otepum/321/edit
[06:50:07] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Thanks
[06:51:31] <toddmparker_> great
[06:51:40] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: that bin doesn't seem to enhance
[06:52:01] <uGoMobi> oh :(
[06:52:16] <uGoMobi> did i use localhost ? checking again
[06:52:57] <uGoMobi> I did
[06:53:42] <toddmparker_> that won't work ;)
[07:02:21] <uGoMobi> ok this is a better one http://jsbin.com/otepum/325/edit
[07:03:07] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: I think that with the changes I suggested setting data-icon="false" on a LI doesn't work
[07:09:26] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: True. I will make it work tho.
[07:18:48] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: cool! I added some more tests to that JSBin, new version: http://jsbin.com/uceduf/2/edit
[07:29:32] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: should <li data-icon="arrow-d"><a href="#">Split - Grid</a><a href="#">x</a></li> show a grid or a down arrow?
[07:29:51] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: I was just thinking the same
[07:30:08] <uGoMobi> I don't know actually
[07:30:40] <uGoMobi> in current code setting data-icon on the LI overrides the setting for the split-icon as well
[07:30:49] <uGoMobi> with my changes it does not
[07:32:49] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: How it currently looks with my code http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6464031/JQM/l.html
[07:32:56] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: I think only data-split-icon on a LI should override that
[07:33:51] <JasonDScott> I did have to make one small change tho to make some of the false work
[07:33:51] <JasonDScott> $('ul#testlistfalse').listview({ inset: true, icon: false });
[07:34:05] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: looks great... just not sure how that works with the split-icon
[07:34:06] <JasonDScott> instead of $('ul#testlistfalse').listview({ inset: true, icon: "false" });
[07:34:17] <JasonDScott> quotes around false
[07:34:37] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[07:34:50] <uGoMobi> yeah, I did too much copy pasting
[07:34:54] <uGoMobi> :D
[07:35:00] <uGoMobi> no quotes needed there
[07:35:42] <JasonDScott> no no, i think you had it right. the user would expect it to be a string. no?
[07:36:20] <uGoMobi> nah true and false are bools so with options you don't put it in a string
[07:36:20] <JasonDScott> I am just saying with my current code it does not work with a string there
[07:36:57] <uGoMobi> I don't think we have to worry about that
[07:37:15] <JasonDScott> even if you would do this: $('ul#testlistfalse').listview({ inset: true, icon: "star" });
[07:37:16] <uGoMobi> I remember agcolom changed all instances in the docs where we used quotes around bools
[07:37:33] <uGoMobi> huh
[07:37:45] <uGoMobi> you mean you can never use a string there?
[07:37:45] <JasonDScott> ok
[07:37:51] <uGoMobi> that's not correct
[07:38:09] <JasonDScott> you can. just not "false"
[07:38:18] <uGoMobi> ok clear
[07:38:36] <JasonDScott> thats fine?
[07:38:39] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:38:52] <JasonDScott> awesome.
[07:38:55] <uGoMobi> :D
[07:39:23] <uGoMobi> just don't understand how the data-icon attribute can override the data-split-icon attribute
[07:39:40] <uGoMobi> or split icon option actually
[07:40:15] <JasonDScott> this is the logic for the split icon   icon: linkIcon || icon || listspliticon || o.splitIcon
[07:40:45] <JasonDScott> maybe it should be icon: listspliticon ||linkIcon || icon  || o.splitIcon
[07:43:47] <uGoMobi> I am looking at the code but I really don't understand the order of that logic
[07:46:28] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: ah I am getting it and yes I think you are right with the suggested reorder
[07:47:38] <uGoMobi> or maybe even... listspliticon || o.splitIcon  || linkIcon || icon
[07:49:42] <uGoMobi> either way... it does not make sense when data-icon overrides data-split-icon
[07:52:32] <JasonDScott> I think we need a bunch of test cases with expected results
[07:53:17] <uGoMobi> yes, probably better to create another test page
[07:54:00] <uGoMobi> but question is what are the exected results? :)
[07:54:10] <uGoMobi> expected*

[08:53:43] <toddmparker_> thanks JasonDScott - looking good
[08:53:50] <toddmparker_> i just commented on that PR
[08:56:37] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_: what would be the time frame for seeing this in a release? Are we doing a 1.2.1 shortly after 1.2?
[08:59:49] <uGoMobi> if we consider it a new feature it probably has to wait until 1.3
[09:04:26] <toddmparker_> this is a borderline one
[09:04:27] <JasonDScott> Ok...
[09:04:38] <toddmparker_> it's small enough it could probably go into a dot release
[09:06:33] <JasonDScott> cool. Any idea when we might release a dot release?
[09:06:48] <toddmparker_> it would probably be in 4-6 weeks
[09:06:58] <JasonDScott> ok. Thanks
[09:07:56] <JasonDScott> I have another question. I want to create a more native looking custom select for the BB10 theme. What would the best way to go about it without the current custom select interfering
[09:14:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: uGoMobi: did you guys see my messages about the two issues we were dealing with
[09:16:55] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott: depends on how different
[09:17:11] <toddmparker_> if you can do it by tacking on some css overrides, that would be preferrable
[09:18:43] <uGoMobi> johnbender: do you mean this one? ... we don't support params to embedded pages https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4943
[09:18:49] <johnbender> uGoMobi: correct
[09:19:44] <uGoMobi> yes I saw your comments there
[09:20:16] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_: something more like this. Possibly not animating tho. http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6464031/demos/dropdown/dropdown.html
[09:20:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you around?
[09:24:37] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: do you want to make the custom select appear as a dropdown?
[09:25:05] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: yes
[09:25:19] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: now the custom select uses the popup widget you might run into positioning issues
[09:27:28] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: definitely.  I not opposed to writing a plugin for this tho. But I think whatever I write the current custom select will interfere
[09:28:04] <JasonDScott> I am just looking for the best approach to tackle this.
[09:34:07] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'll make sure to go through my issues once I get back from my meeting
[09:34:37] <uGoMobi> johnbender: thanks!
[09:38:00] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: do you mean you only adjust theme CSS?
[09:39:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: RIM is copying the new JQM logo... see the favicon of http://blackberry.com/
[09:40:16] <uGoMobi> I expect you get to see the same as I do on the Dutch site
[09:48:03] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: i think JQM copied us from 2010... http://blackberrysync.com/2010/08/the-list-of-countries-who-are-pondering-the-ban-on-blackberry/
[09:48:20] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: nah ;-)
[09:48:52] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: I know :) Completely different

[09:49:29] <uGoMobi> haha
[09:49:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool, I have a meeting at 10:30 so I'll be back then too, perfect
[09:49:51] <JasonDScott> johnbender: haha
[09:50:07] <JasonDScott> johnbender: its for killing the competition
[09:50:21] <JasonDScott> :P
[09:51:01] <uGoMobi> that explains the hole in my Android phone
[09:51:30] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: I do mostly adjust the theme css I have created a few extra plugins tho
[09:51:41] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:52:19] <uGoMobi> but do you run into styling issues when you want to give the select menu a more native look?
[09:52:57] <JasonDScott> yes because it is all pop up based
[09:54:42] <uGoMobi> the popup is centered in the middle of the select
[09:55:09] <uGoMobi> it should be possible to shift it towards the bottom with 50% with CSS
[09:56:07] <uGoMobi> and probably also to make the menu the same width as the select menu button
[09:56:40] <uGoMobi> on orientation change the menu will be centered in the window thought :(
[09:57:36] <uGoMobi> s/thought/though
[10:05:28] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: it looks like the positon of the popup is absolute and left and top applied to the element. I dont think I would be able to adjust its position correctly via css alone
[10:08:12] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: what happens if you give it a negative margin bottom of 50% ?
[10:08:13] <toddmparker_> hrm, that is a little like ours
[10:11:39] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_: our select?
[10:12:04] <uGoMobi> our logo
[10:15:57] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: like this, margin-bottom: -50%?
[10:16:15] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: yes
[10:17:01] <uGoMobi> haven't tried it so I don't know if it will work
[10:20:20] <JasonDScott> doesn
[10:20:28] <JasonDScott> doesnt seem to work*
[10:22:58] <uGoMobi> aii :(
[10:30:46] <JasonDScott> agreed :(
[10:32:30] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: I am afraid that you are right that you can't do this with CSS
[10:34:03] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: anyway that I can just override the current custom select?
[10:34:35] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: the CSS or the generated markup?
[10:35:48] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: The whole widget. So the markup being generated
[10:38:30] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: I am not sure what happens if you copy the custom select plugin, modify everything inside it, and then add this custom script after the framework has loaded
[10:39:23] <uGoMobi> but I thought you didn't want to create a plugin
[10:43:53] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: I think they both fire and clash with each other. I said I was not opposed to writing one. Sorry for the double negative.
[10:45:57] <uGoMobi> ah sorry I misread
[10:46:34] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: I thought about using the download builder to make a build without the custom select and then create my own, but it seems painful to manage
[10:46:56] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: but you can unbind the original plugin from the pagecreate and create event, right?
[10:47:42] <uGoMobi> well that is for the whole select plugin
[10:47:56] <uGoMobi> would have to see how it is done for the custom select
[10:49:28] <uGoMobi> and a select doesn't require a data-role if I am not mistaken
[10:49:43] <uGoMobi> so you have to deal with the initSelector too
[10:49:57] <uGoMobi> so it's a bit more complicated
[10:51:09] * JasonDScott $( document ).unbind( "selectmenubeforecreate" )
[10:51:31] <JasonDScott> then re bind with the new handler?
[10:51:54] <uGoMobi> that's more or less what I was thinking about
[10:52:50] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: thanks I will try that
[10:54:07] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: do you also want to handle the native select menu with your own plugin?
[10:54:46] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: no I think i will leave the native select menu the way it is...
[10:56:25] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:57:50] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: this._trigger( "beforeCreate" );  create is written with a capital in there so the event is selectmenubeforeCreate
[10:59:24] <JasonDScott> hmmmm... odd it is written all lower here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/select.custom.js
[10:59:28] <uGoMobi> unless the widget factory makes this lowercase, but I don't think so
[10:59:48] <uGoMobi> strange indeed
[11:00:13] <uGoMobi> I thought events are case sensitive
[11:02:08] <JasonDScott> hmm i just tested it out. selectmenubeforecreate works but selectmenubeforeCreate doesn't. the widget factory must be making everything lowercase
[11:02:26] <uGoMobi> ok good
[11:02:55] <uGoMobi> sorry for the confusion
[11:06:45] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: no worries, Thanks for all the help!
[11:31:20] <jerone> Question: where is $.mobile.pageContainer used for?
[11:59:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Ping!
[12:00:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ping
[12:00:51] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: just got back
[12:01:02] <johnbender> might duck out for lunch but I definitely have time to chat
[12:03:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP.
[12:03:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Lay it on me.
[12:03:35] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool
[12:03:43] <johnbender> so the issue you raised is a valid one
[12:03:55] <johnbender> it's definitely better to reuse the dialog state if possible
[12:04:15] <johnbender> I have one question about that
[12:04:20] <johnbender> and one concern
[12:04:35] <johnbender> the first question is, don't we have to alter the url to create a new history state in the browser?
[12:04:49] <johnbender> I'm not clear on how that's done if we purely reuse an existing url
[12:05:23] <_|Nix|_> We don't create a new history entry. We merely make sure that urlHistory and browser history are in sync.
[12:05:59] <_|Nix|_> It behaves as if the current history entry had been created for this dialog, not the previous.
[12:06:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: when you go back doesn't it then take you away from the page?
[12:06:45] <johnbender> instead of away from the popup?
[12:07:07] <_|Nix|_> Nono.
[12:07:17] <_|Nix|_> Browser history looks like this: page -> dialog state, right?
[12:07:43] <_|Nix|_> So, if the user moves forward to the dialog state from the page, the dialog will no longer be there.
[12:07:47] <_|Nix|_> That's intended.
[12:08:10] <_|Nix|_> However, if you open a popup into the second state, you no longer need to create a history entry.
[12:08:15] <johnbender> I see, if you go back you're just going back to the original page
[12:08:21] <_|Nix|_> If the current entry is page, and not dialog, you do things normally.
[12:08:24] <johnbender> since there was a refresh to begin with
[12:08:31] <johnbender> hmm
[12:08:52] <johnbender> so I still don't understand
[12:08:53] <_|Nix|_> The reuse only happens if the user clicks forward from a normal page into what used to be a dialog.
[12:09:00] <johnbender> or a deep link
[12:09:05] <johnbender> or a refresh
[12:09:24] <johnbender> let lets assume the second case since it's much more likley
[12:09:28] <_|Nix|_> I don't understand the latter two.
[12:09:45] <johnbender> open a page, open a popup, hit refresh
[12:10:06] <_|Nix|_> Aaah, but that's the other special case: initial-url-has-dialog-hash-key.
[12:10:15] <johnbender> that's what the issue addresses
[12:10:20] <johnbender> he said on a refresh it would break
[12:10:46] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arg, ok I need to step out for lunch
[12:10:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: will you be here in an hour our so?
[12:11:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Go. It seems my daughter can't fall asleep w/o me, so it's good timing.
[12:11:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I will be here.
[12:11:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool I'll ping you
[12:42:37] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender Sorry, something personal has come up. We'll have to talk later.
[12:42:38] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[12:55:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: kk, definitely
[12:55:56] <bot-t> (13 mins 10 secs ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender Sorry, something personal has come up. We'll have to talk later.
[13:02:00] <jerone> Question: where is $.mobile.pageContainer used for?
[13:04:17] <agcolom> Hi, are we still cherry-picking?
[13:06:03] <johnbender> agcolom: I think we have been so it would be good to continue if you can
[13:06:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: still waiting to discuss _|Nix|_'s patch but otherwise I think we're in good shape
[13:06:59] <agcolom> johnbender: sure. been a long time! Is it still 1.1-stable?
[13:07:03] <johnbender> yes
[13:07:10] <agcolom> great! Thanks :-)
[13:07:15] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm going to take a look at my list of issues
[13:09:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: according the tracker I have one issue assigned to me :X
[13:10:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: assigning the base tag stuff to me
[13:11:18] <johnbender> uGoMobi: thanks for tagging those - much easier :)

[13:23:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Ping!
[13:23:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nice!
[13:23:18] <johnbender> one sec
[13:29:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: alright so we established that there are three use cases
[13:29:18] <johnbender> well two
[13:29:30] <johnbender> refresh/deeplink to a popup dialog hash key
[13:29:38] <johnbender> and then something else you were tlaking about that I was confused on
[13:29:39] * johnbender is slow
[13:30:37] <_|Nix|_> The second issue is this: page -> popup <- back -> forward -> popup
[13:31:22] <_|Nix|_> The if ( hasHash ) stuff is necessary for the second issue. The engagement with $.mobile.urlHistory.initialDst is necessary for the first issue.
[13:31:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ok ok
[13:32:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: one sec
[13:37:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: actually my solution works for that case too
[13:37:18] <johnbender> because the initial dialog state does not include the id ref
[13:37:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: though I definitely side with you on consistency for inclusion of the id ref
[13:37:52] <johnbender> it should be one way or the other
[13:41:10] <_|Nix|_> Your solution reuses the hash key, but only if there's no initial hash key. If there is an initial hash key, and you go through the steps for the second issue, it does not reuse.
[13:41:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: have you tried it?
[13:41:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I can set up a jsbin for you
[13:42:08] <_|Nix|_> I have tried it. page -> popup -> refresh -> popup -> back -> forward -> popup -> back.
[13:42:26] <johnbender> that's the refresh case
[13:42:30] <johnbender> which is the first case
[13:42:36] <johnbender> where it does indeed tack on a new one
[13:42:40] <johnbender> two things
[13:42:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Aaah, but it's followed by the second case :)
[13:42:54] <johnbender> that are advantages to "tacking it on"
[13:42:58] <johnbender> 1. smaller code chnage
[13:43:22] <johnbender> ie, reduced risk
[13:43:31] <johnbender> 2. history entry creation
[13:43:44] <johnbender> ie, you _have_ to change the url on a deep link to a dialog
[13:43:57] <johnbender> otherwise you'll back out of the site when you click a popup and go back
[13:44:35] <_|Nix|_> Yes, but if the user moves forward into a history entry that used to be a dialog, you don't want to create yet another history entry.
[13:44:36] <johnbender> we can change that later to alter it in a way that "reuses" a single dialog state but changes the hash to create a history entry later using the popup id attribute
[13:44:59] <_|Nix|_> The above sequence leaves you with 4 history entries, all of which are dialog states.
[13:45:24] <_|Nix|_> Or, rather, all of which look identical to the user.
[13:45:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ahh, and there's another sequence where it fails
[13:45:35] <johnbender> it has to differentiate somehow thhough
[13:45:59] <johnbender> in the initial state only
[13:46:40] <johnbender> there has to be a hashchange in that case
[13:46:55] <johnbender> we can't, in the strict sense, re-use the dialog hash state
[13:47:02] <johnbender> we have to alter it somehow
[13:47:15] <_|Nix|_> ... and we do.
[13:47:23] <johnbender> how?
[13:48:04] <_|Nix|_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L748
[13:48:12] <_|Nix|_> We tack on another hash key :)
[13:48:34] <_|Nix|_> Notice that the check on that line is independent of the previous check.
[13:49:13] <_|Nix|_> That independence ensures that if the previous check has accidentally reconstructed the initial hash, then another hash key is tacked on.
[13:49:49] <_|Nix|_> That way, it ensures that a new history item is created off the initial history entry.
[13:53:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: testing something quickly
[13:59:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm going to keep looking at this
[14:00:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: but I absolutely will _not_ make any changes to master without first checking with you
[14:01:52] <_|Nix|_> There's another interesting scenario: page -> popup -> refresh -> popup -> back. This takes you back to the URL /before/ the refresh!
[14:01:58] <_|Nix|_> Same with dialogs.
[14:02:38] <_|Nix|_> So, technically, it kicks you out of internal history, but since the page before it is another instance of jQM, it actually works as if you had reused the dialog state.
[14:03:15] <_|Nix|_> However, if history starts with a dialogHashKey, it doesn't kick you out.
[14:04:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah that's what I was alluding to earlier
[14:06:57] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ...
[14:07:42] <_|Nix|_> I don't get what the difference is between refreshing on a dialog hash state, and typing the URL already containing the dialog hash state into a clean tab.
[14:07:57] <_|Nix|_> There should be no difference.
[14:09:15] <johnbender> there is!
[14:09:18] <johnbender> you just said it
[14:09:33] <_|Nix|_> What's the difference?
[14:09:34] <johnbender> as far as the browser is concerned it isn't
[14:09:47] <johnbender> but when you jump back across a refresh you still get jqm
[14:10:00] <johnbender> when you jump back across a deeplink you get nothing
[14:10:05] <_|Nix|_> Yes, I know, but it shouldn't jump back across a refresh.
[14:10:09] <johnbender> agreed
[14:10:16] <johnbender> totall and complete agreement
[14:10:33] <johnbender> I was just pointing out earlier that the refresh case can be deceptive
[14:10:40] <johnbender> since it "works"
[14:10:45] <johnbender> but the deeplink obviously wont
[14:11:01] <johnbender> that is, the case that we should test should never be the "refresh" case but rathe the deeplink equivalent
[14:11:10] <johnbender> "test" in the manual sense
[14:11:49] <_|Nix|_> The deeplink case is easily caught using $.mobile.urlHistory.initialDst. It's in the dialog special case check in _handleHashChange.
[14:12:16] <_|Nix|_> That's what's preventing it from jumping out of jQM space.
[14:13:03] <_|Nix|_> http://slashdot.org -> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dialog/index.html#&ui-state=dialog -> Open dialog -> back
[14:13:12] <_|Nix|_> You won't be back on slashdot.
[14:14:25] <_|Nix|_> Same thing's true for popup.
[14:19:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I think the refresh case shall be a story for thursday for me. I'm off all day tomorrow, and I must head to bed.
[14:19:17] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: np np, have a good one
[14:19:26] <_|Nix|_> L8R all!
[14:19:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks for walking me through all this :)
[15:03:24] <uGoMobi> johnbender: are you sure about only 1 issue being assigned to you? ;-) https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/assigned/johnbender?sort=created&state=open
[15:03:57] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I was wondering
[15:04:07] <johnbender> I must have had an extra filter or some such
[15:04:16] <johnbender> because I literally had no issues :/
[15:04:35] <uGoMobi> johnbender: felt good for a moment? ;-)
[15:04:40] <johnbender> sort of
[15:04:41] <johnbender> lol
[15:04:48] <johnbender> felt like I was a lazy bastard
[15:04:54] <uGoMobi> haha
[15:23:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/vEXU6A

[15:24:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes
[15:24:37] <johnbender> you're probably sleeping but I'm curious why we couldn't simply cherry pick those issues
[15:24:41] <johnbender> err
[15:24:42] <johnbender>  commits
[15:24:53] <uGoMobi> johnbender: typing while I sleep
[15:25:02] <johnbender> lol
[15:25:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: lets talk about it tomorrow
[15:25:14] <johnbender> no need to get into it tonight
[15:25:24] <johnbender> I was going to leave you a message with the bot
[15:25:27] <uGoMobi> johnbender: no it's ok
[15:25:36] <uGoMobi> I know what it was about
[15:25:53] <uGoMobi> and I think it is as simple as picking those 3 commits
[15:25:57] <johnbender> cool
[15:26:50] <uGoMobi> but if I remember well I was just not completely sure if everything should be picked
[15:26:57] <johnbender> uGoMobi: one of those appears to be a feature
[15:27:46] <uGoMobi> right
[15:28:42] <uGoMobi> johnbender: if it is going to be lot of work to make it work without picking all 3 I suggest just to pick them all
[15:28:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: indeed
[15:29:02] <johnbender> I'll look into the issue to see what the minimum is to get it working
[15:29:08] <uGoMobi> not even sure if there ever will be a 1.1.2
[15:29:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: and with that I've bothered you for nothing :/
[15:29:13] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I hope there is
[15:29:17] <johnbender> we've put work into it :)
[15:29:25] <uGoMobi> no worries
[15:29:32] <johnbender> though we haven't done patch releases after dot releases
[15:29:39] <johnbender> from previous dot releases that is
[15:30:28] <uGoMobi> what do you mean?
[15:30:31] <uGoMobi> 1.0.1
[15:30:38] <uGoMobi> 1.1.1
[15:31:42] <uGoMobi> johnbender: what is definition of a patch release?
[15:31:45] <johnbender> uGoMobi: 1.1.1
[15:31:51] <johnbender> point release is 1.2.0
[15:31:55] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:32:04] <johnbender> we've not done something like 1.1.2 after a 1.2.0
[15:32:08] <johnbender> but that doesn't mean we shouldn't
[15:32:14] <uGoMobi> ah no I get it
[15:32:22] <uGoMobi> yeah, it's a bit strange order

[16:02:01] <quanta> Hi guys, I've posted my question in #jquerymobile but nobody answers so I try here just in case someone could help me. In fact we had some issues related to jqm when we use $.mobile.changePage. More precisely, an exception is thrown line 3242 when pageTitle = page.find( ".ui-title:eq(0)" ) is executed we got Error: SYNTAX_ERR: DOM Exception 12
[16:02:14] <quanta> if I do page.find( ".ui-title") it returns an empty array
[16:02:33] <quanta> we use jqm: 1.2.0-rc1
[16:04:09] <uGoMobi> quanta: can you open a new issue on github and include a test page?
[16:04:37] <quanta> sure
[16:04:43] <uGoMobi> quanta: here is a template you can use http://jsbin.com/uwaxaj/1/edit
