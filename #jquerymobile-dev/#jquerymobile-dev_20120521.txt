[09:15:30] <gseguin> Good morning!
[09:19:41] <Wilto> Whatup, gseguin.
[09:19:51] <Wilto> What have I missed? Is jQM done yet?
[09:19:59] <gseguin> hey did some progress on the builder
[09:20:07] <gseguin> you can now namespace the css
[09:20:11] <gseguin> so you do:
[09:20:26] <gseguin> css.structure: file1,file2
[09:20:35] <gseguin> css.theme: file1, file2
[09:21:04] <gseguin> not sure the dependency resolution works great yet, I'll get on that on Wed
[09:21:14] <Wilto> Sweeeet.
[09:21:25] <Wilto> Still radio silence from the early testers?
[09:21:45] <gseguin> toddparker is getting the feedback if any
[09:34:52] <toddparker> hi all
[09:35:03] <toddparker> that's great
[09:35:07] <toddparker> gseguin:
[09:35:13] <toddparker> not much feedback, no
[09:35:38] <toddparker> anyone have an iOS device and want to dig into the popup code today?
[09:36:04] <Wilto> gseguin, toddparker: Once that dep thing is settled Wednesday, do we want to rotate a few more testers in? Call it “Alpha 2” or somesuch?
[09:36:06] <toddparker> the demos look great on Chrome, but popups are slow on my new 4S and they seem to die after opening and closing 2-3
[09:36:18] <toddparker> _|Nix|_ doesn't have an iOS device for testing
[09:36:28] <toddparker> the form popups both don't' work at all :/
[09:51:05] <gseguin> Wilto: Sounds like a good idea
[09:51:33] <gseguin> toddparker: popup are very slow on iPad3
[09:59:39] <agcolom> Good evening everyone :-)
[10:01:56] <MauriceG_> Hi all!
[10:02:29] <agcolom> gseguin, toddparker: quick question regarding the docs... it seems to me that none of the new commits in the jquery-mobile/docs/pages folder can be cherry-picked as that contains the menu item for popups and loading widgets which are not in 1.1-stable
[10:02:46] <agcolom> Hi Maurice
[10:03:15] <MauriceG_> toddparker: it seems, that are not the form popups, it is the slidedown transition on iPad3
[10:03:24] <toddparker> true agcolom
[10:03:25] <gseguin> agcolom: it can be cherry-picked but will probably needs some manual merging
[10:03:30] <toddparker> that's ok i guess
[10:03:45] <toddparker> we tryt o pull tweaks over but if we can't get 'em all, that's ok
[10:03:50] <agcolom> yes they are minor changes (ID -> id)
[10:04:02] <agcolom> is that ok to wait for 1.2?
[10:04:05] <MauriceG_> Hi Anne :-)
[10:04:09] <toddparker> i'd prioritize the ones we pull over, only back port important fixes
[10:04:16] <toddparker> hey MauriceG_
[10:04:18] <agcolom> ok
[10:04:43] <agcolom> gseguin, I managed to recover from a conflict all by myself!!!!
[10:04:44] <MauriceG_> hey ToddParker
[10:04:48] <toddparker> been meaning to ask you to really dig in and help us triage bugs - that's where I need a ton of help
[10:04:54] <toddparker> we're swamped
[10:05:07] <gseguin> agcolom: woohoo!
[10:05:11] <toddparker> specifically, look thru issues to make sure they are detailed and reproducable
[10:05:21] <agcolom> I know, I hope you are impressed!!!! (I am ;-) )
[10:05:31] <toddparker> if so, route important ones to me to flag for 1.1.1 or 1.2
[10:05:43] <toddparker> i'm impressed
[10:05:55] <agcolom> I had to reset twice and it did the trick...
[10:05:55] <gseguin> I am ;)
[10:05:57] <toddparker> i almost ruined everything with my github shenanigans
[10:07:05] <agcolom> was complaining of two changes so did git reset (file), git checkout (file) still complaining of 1 change, so again git reset, git checkout and was then clean!
[10:08:01] <agcolom> I wish gseguin could transfer his git knowledge direct to my brain!
[10:08:43] <toddparker> me too
[10:09:07] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i need your triage help, and keep cranking on those fixes. great work.
[10:09:30] <gseguin> heh :) the best way to learn git is to screw up and learn from that
[10:09:51] <uGoMobi> hi all
[10:10:00] <agcolom> Hi Jasper!
[10:10:05] <MauriceG_> Hi Jasper!
[10:10:21] <uGoMobi> toddparker: have been scanning the issue tracker already this weekend
[10:11:10] <uGoMobi> toddparker: also added to agenda that we migth want to update labels... add some labels like "fixed toolbar"
[10:11:33] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom, hi MauriceG_
[10:12:27] <toddparker> happy to add any labels you think would be helpful
[10:12:33] <toddparker> uGoMobi ^^
[10:12:36] <toddparker> fire away
[10:12:39] <uGoMobi> toddparker: so many times I have the feeling have seen a (related) issue before but can't find them anymore
[10:12:43] <toddparker> yeah
[10:12:55] <toddparker> we used to have labels for every widget and that got crazy, but i agree
[10:13:14] <uGoMobi> yeah shouldnt be too many labels
[10:13:23] <agcolom> uGoMobi: The GitHub search works really well for that
[10:14:14] <agcolom> you can also search open as well as closed issues. otherwise google with site:github.com can be very helpful as well
[10:14:49] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sometimes it does, but sometimes I still can't find it until after browsing 23 pages of issues
[10:15:29] <uGoMobi> use google is a good idea... can i narrow it down to JQM repo?
[10:16:13] <uGoMobi> toddparker: labels... "fixed toolbars", "android" or maybe "android 2.x"
[10:17:12] <uGoMobi> toddparker: "transitions"
[10:17:51] <uGoMobi> toddparker: maybe for now "popup" since it is new, can delete it again later
[10:17:58] <toddparker> we don't have issues on any of those topics ;)
[10:18:00] <MauriceG_> uGoMobi: may site:github.com inurl:jquery-mobile popup  for goggle
[10:18:09] <toddparker> the issue auto-complete is the worst
[10:18:22] <toddparker> i have no idea what it searches against
[10:18:37] <uGoMobi> toddparker: we don't have issues at all... only things that can be improved a little bit ;-)
[10:19:55] <toddparker> Ok, I added all but android 2.x
[10:20:05] <toddparker> Can you assign these right now?
[10:20:17] <toddparker> If so, you should be able to add too
[10:20:21] <uGoMobi> toddparker: i can't assign labels
[10:20:27] <toddparker> you will soon
[10:20:29] <toddparker> ad priority
[10:20:43] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok
[10:21:37] <toddparker> just asked danheberden about that
[10:21:52] <uGoMobi> MauriceG_: thanks for that... seems to work
[10:22:25] <agcolom> MauriceG yes you can: search term followed by  site:https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile
[10:23:12] <uGoMobi> cool
[10:24:21] <uGoMobi> problem with inurl is that the topics of the issues are not always covering the content
[10:25:07] <danheberden> toddparker you did?
[10:25:44] <danheberden> oh shoot
[10:26:38] <danheberden> that moment when you realize someone asked you to do something and you forgot
[10:27:33] <johnbender> danheberden: story of my life
[10:27:58] <danheberden> uGoMobi you've been added
[10:28:09] <uGoMobi> thank you danheberden
[10:33:28] <johnbender> nice! I see people have been working on pull requests
[10:33:30] <johnbender> down to 35
[10:33:32] <johnbender> hell yah
[10:34:03] <agcolom> yes, but my ones  have been easy ;-)
[10:34:20] <uGoMobi> johnbender: you inspired them with your pr count -10 the other day :-)

[11:03:09] <gseguin> toddparker, johnbender: RIM meeting ?
[11:03:34] <johnbender> toddparker: johnbender: I don't normally attend
[11:03:40] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[11:03:43] <johnbender> are you on the line now?
[11:03:48] <gseguin> yeah
[11:03:54] <johnbender> gseguin: hrm
[11:04:04] <gseguin> I don't know it's on my calendar so I called in
[11:04:08] <johnbender> and we have some biker guy reving his engine outside the house
[11:04:18] <johnbender> toddparker: toddmparker_ ^
[11:04:18] <gseguin> I'm not usually very active though
[11:04:21] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[11:04:33] <johnbender> I don't know if you guys know where todd is
[11:04:38] <johnbender> scottjehl: ^
[11:19:11] <johnbender> gseguin: :(
[11:19:16] <johnbender> just got the email from Laurent
[11:19:28] <johnbender> we almost had a fight here at the office
[11:19:30] <johnbender> so eh
[11:19:32] <johnbender> I was distracted
[11:23:56] <gseguin> johnbender: a fight as in fist fight?
[11:24:04] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[11:24:10] <gseguin> with you involved?
[11:24:13] <johnbender> well
[11:24:17] <johnbender> I got involved
[11:24:23] <johnbender> but I broke it up before anyone started punching
[11:24:28] <johnbender> gseguin: it was outside the office
[11:24:40] <Wilto> oh uh right the blackberry call ahem
[11:26:28] <Wilto> Thanks yet again, iCloud.
[11:27:24] <toddparker> yikes, botched that RIM call. My calendar ate that invite somehow
[11:28:06] <toddparker> woah, gseguin what was the fight about?
[11:28:09] <toddparker> semicolons?
[11:28:17] <toddparker> probably me thinks.
[11:28:21] <Wilto> was it about responsive images
[11:28:36] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[11:28:43] <toddparker> JasonDScott and uGoMobi - you should now have commit access. congrats you guys!
[11:28:46] <johnbender> something far sillier
[11:28:52] <johnbender> w00t
[11:29:12] <toddparker> what??
[11:29:16] <gseguin> or maybe it was about that new tag: <picture; srcset="">
[11:29:18] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yeah! thanks Todd! I am already busy labeling :-)
[11:29:36] <johnbender> the next door neighbor was being _exceptionally_ loud on his motorcycle
[11:29:37] <toddparker> i need a silly excuse to sucker punch an office mate
[11:29:37] <toddparker> great, thanks uGoMobi
[11:29:37] <Wilto> gseguin: +1
[11:29:50] <johnbender> and my friend went out to complain
[11:29:54] <johnbender> not the first time
[11:29:57] <johnbender> the guy is a serious hot head
[11:30:05] <toddparker> riiight
[11:30:13] <toddparker> best way to get one in the kisser
[11:30:14] <gseguin> Congrats uGoMobi and JasonDScott !
[11:30:24] <Wilto> `<img/picture srcset="media query(min-width: 200m) 2x" <source = picture>>` is the official syntax now, gseguin
[11:30:43] <Wilto> He said, 1) not exaggerating by much and 2) sobbing quietly under his desk.
[11:30:44] <toddparker> so now that you fellas are committers, you can assign labels, ownership and milestones to issues
[11:30:56] <toddparker> so feel free to assign bugs you are looking at
[11:31:16] <uGoMobi> will do
[11:31:28] <toddparker> if possible, sutmit tests for any fixes you land
[11:31:29] <gseguin> Wilto: that looks much clearer than that <picture><img></picture> non-sense
[11:31:38] * gseguin ducks
[11:31:40] <Wilto> ?flip
[11:31:46] <Wilto> ?comboflip
[11:31:49] <Wilto> …
[11:32:07] <toddparker> and always use PRs or branches for changes. small fixes can be landed directly if well tested.
[11:32:10] <Wilto> Et tu, bot-t?
[11:32:16] <toddparker> heh
[11:32:22] <uGoMobi> toddparker: looking into how to make those test, got info from scott and johnbender offered help already :-)
[11:32:44] <gseguin> bot-t is outside Adobe's office dealing with the motorcycle guy
[11:32:56] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:33:25] <uGoMobi> can't they just photoshop him away
[11:33:43] <gseguin> :)
[11:33:59] <johnbender> yay!
[11:34:13] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it's a pain to learn at first but it's not so bad once you've done it a few times
[11:35:45] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah i am sure i can manage, just didn't try yet
[11:36:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I appreciate you making the effort :D
[11:36:30] <uGoMobi> johnbender: any hells angels in front of the office already?
[11:37:23] <Wilto> If yes, play some Rolling Stones to appease them.
[11:37:33] <uGoMobi> lol
[11:37:34] <toddparker> or motorhead
[11:37:44] <toddparker> (how to do an oomlat?)
[11:37:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: not yet no
[11:37:54] <johnbender> I just broke it up
[11:38:08] <Wilto> Option + U. ö
[11:41:48] <uGoMobi> Wilto: how about merging this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4038

[11:56:41] <toddparker> uGoMobi: what's your email address? adding people to our basecamp
[11:57:17] <agcolom> BTW, do you need testing on popups? (i have the following devices: iPod Touch iOS 4.2, iOS 5.0.1, iPad 1 iOS 5.1, iPad 2 iOS 4.3.3)
[11:57:25] <uGoMobi> toddparker: jasper@ugomobi.com
[11:57:43] <agcolom> hey wilto, we missed you... how was Texas?
[12:02:11] <Wilto> Not bad, agcolom. Not bad at all. Spent some quality time in the middle of nowhere.
[12:02:58] <toddparker> i do agcolom
[12:03:03] <toddparker> i found them to be very slow
[12:03:13] <toddparker> and to stop working after a few clicks
[12:03:31] <toddparker> i guess we really need someone with iOS drives to dig and and see why
[12:03:35] <toddparker> since _|Nix|_
[12:03:40] <toddparker> doesn't have devices
[12:05:00] <MauriceG_> agocolom: did you try on iPad 1 ? (seems faster than iPad 3)
[12:05:15] <agcolom> not tried on anything yet.. will do now...
[12:06:46] <MauriceG_> on iPad 3 I don't get the slide up/slide down popups working UNTIL I use the Photo popup
[12:11:04] <agcolom> somthing wrong with css dialog I think on iPod Touch
[12:11:21] <agcolom> (iOS 5.0.1)
[12:11:30] <agcolom> Shall i send a picture?
[12:12:22] <agcolom> (bottom part doesn't stop where the header does (width is incorrect)
[12:12:39] <agcolom> Also I cannot get the form one to come up
[12:14:14] <MauriceG_> I changed the transistion from slidedown to fade in local repo for the form link at it works
[12:14:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah ... sorry guys ... I complain about it every week to my boss ...
[12:14:51] <toddparker> i think we first need to narrow down the specific issues and steps to reproduce and create some tickets
[12:15:03] <toddparker> seems like certain content (forms?) break the popup
[12:15:10] <toddparker> and certain transitions too (3D?)
[12:15:29] <agcolom> slideup and slidedown do not work and do not fall back to anything, so the popups do not come up at all
[12:15:40] <agcolom> I think it's the transition
[12:15:42] <MauriceG_> on iPad 1 the form link works with slidedown ...
[12:17:02] <_|Nix|_> I just fixed the form-submit thing ... it turns out that when you submit a form, a whole other page is created, and all the IDs of the first page are duplicated on the second ...
[12:17:30] <_|Nix|_> So when I hook up the popup to the button, I need to restrict my selectors to the current page ...
[12:17:51] <_|Nix|_> Is that even the intended behaviour? i.e., is it intended that a submit button duplicates the page?
[12:18:42] <MauriceG_> _|Nix|_ No. Not the submit issue. The form popup just shows the overlay. Nothing else (iPad2 and iPad3)
[12:19:06] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK ...
[12:19:32] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG_: Man, this is killing me ... I really need to get those devices ...
[12:19:43] <toddparker> yeah, you need something iOS
[12:19:54] <toddparker> they're pretty popular i hear
[12:20:11] <toddparker> uGoMobi: might be a good one to look into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4412
[12:20:12] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4412 on jquery-mobile (ToddThomson; 13m, 30s ago): UpdatePagePadding() and ui-page-header{ padding-top:2.5em; }
[12:20:18] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ I'm in your timezone, always with an iOS device and always happy to test ;-)
[12:20:20] <toddparker> did you already to a patch for this
[12:21:06] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: You're two timezones earlier than me, but yeah ... closer than most.
[12:21:08] <agcolom> If I'm at work, i'm not on IRC, but email me coloma@wmin.ac.uk or iMessage: coloma@wmin.ac.uk
[12:21:41] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ it's 20.21 here. What time is it for you?
[12:21:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: 22:21
[12:22:45] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Hmmm ... this screen-appears-but-container-does-not issue is weird ... I wonder if it's a coordinate problem, or a transition-fallback problem ...
[12:23:45] <_|Nix|_> But, honestly, it's a little complicated to test without a device in front of me, because I'd need to set up a client-server js console and stuff like that.
[12:24:10] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm .... I have an idea ...
[12:24:49] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: you have access to a mac?
[12:24:53] <agcolom> Yes, so you're 2h ahead... not so bad. I usually have a gap between 8am and 9am when I just wait to take my son to school, so good time to catch me... and no more teaching now, so I am available most of the time at work also (I'd have less deices but still usually 2 iPod Touch + my colleagues also have stuff I can play with
[12:24:59] <toddparker> you can install the SDK + emulator
[12:25:27] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... from Apple?
[12:25:41] <agcolom> yes hachintosh
[12:26:13] <agcolom> but that's not allowed... don't do it!
[12:26:35] <agcolom> is iPhoney realiable?
[12:26:54] <MauriceG_> or you can use jsconsole and agcolom tap what you say ...
[12:28:09] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG_: I'm about to set that up ...
[12:34:43] <toddparker> yeah, if you're on a mac, you can download the SDK from the app store for $10
[12:35:44] <agcolom> you can't do that with a PC
[12:42:15] <toddparker> nope
[12:42:23] <toddparker> but why would you be on a pc?
[12:42:31] <toddparker> :p
[12:43:55] <agcolom> PC?? Not me for sure!!!!
[12:44:19] <agcolom> I thought _|Nix|_ was on a PC??
[12:44:26] <toddparker> unix?
[12:44:41] <agcolom> _|Nix|_?
[12:44:59] <toddparker> in any case, it is very helpful to have access to iOS for testing
[12:45:26] <agcolom> yep. I'll be his eyes... if we don't have any better solution. How about htat?
[12:45:31] <agcolom> that?
[12:46:34] <toddparker> sure
[12:47:20] <MauriceG> I think that's senseless. Nix: if I send you my iPad 2, I'll get it back someday?
[12:47:39] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ do you prefer live comments or a doc?
[12:48:35] <toddparker> i think issues would probably be helpful.
[12:48:51] <toddparker> with details on steps to repro and any diagnostics
[12:49:22] <toddparker> like "if I remove transition X and change it to Y, the popup works but only under these conditions"
[12:49:55] <toddparker> might be worth doing a first step of just making a branch that has no transitions for popups
[12:50:07] <toddparker> to see if it's the transitions or not
[12:50:18] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: is there ea global setting for popup transitions
[12:50:39] <toddparker> don't see one
[12:51:22] <toddparker> if there was an option to turn off transitions and test already, anne could give that a god
[12:51:24] <toddparker> go
[12:55:28] <agcolom> yes, I removed transition from the form popup and all works fine on iOS 5.0.1 (iPod Touch)
[12:55:30] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/okehir/75/
[12:55:36] <agcolom> (use form 3)
[12:55:50] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_: ^ ?  last chance ...
[12:56:04] <agcolom> so there is an issue with iOS 5.0.1 iPod Touch and all slide stransition
[12:56:24] <agcolom> slide, slideup and slidedown do not seem to work
[12:56:38] <agcolom> probably need a fallback?
[12:56:53] <toddparker> thanks agcolom
[12:57:21] <agcolom> There's an issue with the dialog popup... will upload a picture.
[12:58:22] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Can you please visit http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/jquery-mobile/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[12:58:24] <toddparker> on my 4S, still flaky
[12:58:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... from your IOS device?
[12:58:58] <agcolom> ok... coming now...
[13:00:06] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Please reload and open a single problematic popup.
[13:00:40] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Thanks.
[13:00:42] <agcolom> form... I get the overlay... nothing comes up
[13:00:56] <MauriceG> ipad 3 also
[13:01:04] <agcolom> shall I try others?
[13:05:24] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Refresh and re-open login form, please!
[13:05:43] <_|Nix|_> BTW: Please no one else use the above page - I can't tell who's generating which log messages.
[13:05:45] <agcolom> refreshing
[13:05:56] <agcolom> form
[13:06:04] <agcolom> still the same
[13:06:33] <agcolom> repeating to be sure I have refreshed properly...
[13:06:37] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK - you did an open and close.
[13:06:40] <agcolom> refresh
[13:06:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: It's not supposed to be fixed.
[13:06:48] <agcolom> form
[13:06:52] <agcolom> ok
[13:07:02] <agcolom> I've done it twice
[13:08:24] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ do you have a twitter account?
[13:08:39] <agcolom> (to send you a picture)
[13:10:08] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: No.
[13:13:31] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ the dialog popup: http://instagr.am/p/K5s9yCS6-1/
[13:14:39] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I don't get it - it seems like it's showing up ...
[13:14:57] <agcolom> that's the dialog, not the form
[13:15:10] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Oh, right ...
[13:15:29] <_|Nix|_> agcolom:  ... but the problem is with the form, right?
[13:15:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Can you please refresh and open the form exactly once?
[13:16:00] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: There will be no change - just some debugging going on.
[13:16:09] <agcolom> yes, the problem with the form is actually a problem with the transition to the form
[13:16:20] <agcolom> ok....
[13:16:20] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I suspect so, as well.
[13:16:42] <agcolom> refreshing
[13:16:48] <agcolom> form
[13:17:07] <agcolom> The form came up
[13:17:12] <_|Nix|_> OK. Thanks!
[13:17:14] <_|Nix|_> What?!
[13:17:20] <_|Nix|_> I didn't change anything ...
[13:17:43] <_|Nix|_> *scratch head&
[13:17:45] <agcolom> ah... the form is up...
[13:17:45] <_|Nix|_> *
[13:18:08] <_|Nix|_> Did you run it again?
[13:18:23] <agcolom> just when you said..
[13:18:28] <agcolom> Shall I try again?
[13:18:42] <_|Nix|_> Egads! Who's doing this?
[13:18:45] <agcolom> I am regreshing
[13:18:54] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[13:18:57] <agcolom> I just refreshed....
[13:19:06] <_|Nix|_> Go ahead. Open the form again.
[13:19:08] <agcolom> now will press form...
[13:19:15] <agcolom> done
[13:19:25] <_|Nix|_> Is it up?
[13:19:40] <agcolom> ok. It comes up when I rotate the device!
[13:20:13] <_|Nix|_> Wait - you can't see it, but when you rotate, you can?
[13:20:18] <agcolom> yes
[13:20:35] <agcolom> hang on I'll do it again to be sure... This is excellent!
[13:20:41] <agcolom> refresh
[13:21:00] <agcolom> form
[13:21:19] <agcolom> nothing.... I've scrolled up and down...
[13:21:24] <agcolom> rotate
[13:21:36] <agcolom> It's there
[13:21:50] <agcolom> rotate back it's still there
[13:21:54] <_|Nix|_> Weird ...
[13:22:09] <MauriceG> ipad 3  click, overlay, rotate. forms there
[13:22:11] <agcolom> Let me try when I first start in landscape
[13:22:22] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK.
[13:22:23] <agcolom> refresh
[13:22:32] <agcolom> form
[13:22:41] <agcolom> nothing there
[13:23:00] <MauriceG> same with slide up / slide down popups in the docs ...
[13:23:01] <agcolom> rotate to portrait...
[13:23:15] <agcolom> it's there now position is wrong.
[13:23:26] <agcolom> let me try
[13:23:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah, because it opened to (152,439)[236x212]
[13:23:53] <agcolom> when I rotate to portrait, the position looks as though it's putting it for lanscape view
[13:23:54] <_|Nix|_> Weird that it does not appear ...
[13:24:02] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's right.
[13:24:21] <agcolom> now with slideup
[13:24:30] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: There's nothing in the debug that points to something wrong with the way it's being handled.
[13:24:39] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Everything /should/ be good ...
[13:24:46] <agcolom> same thing
[13:24:50] <agcolom> it comes ups
[13:24:55] <agcolom> sorry it comes up
[13:25:01] <agcolom> when I rotate
[13:25:14] <_|Nix|_> Yeah - I don't get it ...
[13:25:46] <agcolom> could it be that it's triggered by one of the rotate event?
[13:26:15] <agcolom> only affects the slide/slideup/slidedown
[13:26:16] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Put the device in portrait, refresh, and do the slideup example exactly once, please!
[13:26:22] <agcolom> ok
[13:26:33] <agcolom> refresh
[13:26:44] <agcolom> slideup
[13:26:49] <agcolom> nothing
[13:26:55] <agcolom> rotate?
[13:26:59] <_|Nix|_> Nono.
[13:27:07] <_|Nix|_> I think I know what's the problem: (10,978.5)[300x72]
[13:27:10] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_:  one thing:  slide up/down don't work until I use the photo popup. after that they work.
[13:27:12] <agcolom> no popup on screen
[13:27:20] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Weird ...
[13:27:33] <_|Nix|_> It's putting the popup waaaay too low ...
[13:27:49] <_|Nix|_> 978 is, like, below the screen, isn't it?
[13:27:56] <agcolom> yes
[13:28:22] <MauriceG> landscape yes
[13:28:29] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK ... this may have something to do with the way it's calculating x and y ...
[13:28:42] <_|Nix|_> toddparker may have been right. We might need position from UI ...
[13:29:32] <_|Nix|_> Calculating x and y coordinates seems impossible ... I'm glad someone was smart enough to write position once, and is smart enough to maintain it.
[13:31:44] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: to come back to the other popup issue with the dialog, the dialog content is wider than the dialog header, https://twitter.com/#!/agcolom/status/204666777102331904/photo/1
[13:31:45] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from agcolom: @agcolom testing http://t.co/8pjH6h87 ★ http://bit.ly/Mc383Z
[13:33:29] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah ... seing that ...
[13:33:49] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... this is too much - I need an iSomething ...

[13:34:38] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4413 on jquery-mobile (Alexn; 39m, 22s ago): Error inside jquery.mobile.button.css

[13:34:55] <johnbender> feel free to remove yourself
[13:35:38] <agcolom> and I need some chocolate ;-)
[13:40:15] <uGoMobi> is there a chance there will be a 1.1.2 release as well or going straight to 1.2 after 1.1.1 ?
[13:40:43] <agcolom> anyone with an iPhone 5.1 or iPod Touch 5.1 around?
[13:41:18] <uGoMobi> sorry, Android here
[13:41:22] <MauriceG> yep..
[13:42:08] <uGoMobi> toddparker: is there a chance there will be a 1.1.2 release as well or going straight to 1.2 after 1.1.1 ?
[13:42:31] <agcolom> ok, can you try http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[13:42:39] <agcolom> then click on dialog
[13:43:03] <agcolom> is the dialog content wider than the dialog header?
[13:43:29] <MauriceG> yep
[13:43:42] <MauriceG> on the right
[13:43:48] <agcolom> yes
[13:43:58] <agcolom> uGoMobi, same for you on Android?
[13:44:09] <agcolom> (in a portrait mode)
[13:44:17] <uGoMobi> sorry what?
[13:44:38] <agcolom> can you try http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html then click on dialog
[13:44:45] <agcolom> is the dialog content wider than the dialog header?
[13:45:05] <uGoMobi> hang on will check
[13:45:11] <agcolom> thx
[13:45:47] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ looks like a padding or border issue?
[13:46:30] <MauriceG> btw. the default popup has a double padding on top on iphone other than on ipad
[13:50:19] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ to test the slide something issue and popup positioning, use Safari and make the window narrow. The same effect happens. The slidesomething does not come up. resize the window, it comes up
[13:50:38] <MauriceG> and for _|Nix|_  using menu - edit - undo - options - back to Basics - form: it is there
[13:53:38] <MauriceG> agcolom: can you confirm that on ipod?
[13:53:46] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ something interesting...
[13:53:53] <agcolom> yes I can
[13:54:32] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK - I can try to install Safari on my Windoze machine ...
[13:54:41] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ when the window is narrow, it is not that there is a double padding at the top, but the padding at the bottom doesn't come up
[13:55:29] <agcolom> That bottom padding comes when the switch between having the menu to the left or at the bottom comes
[13:55:37] <agcolom> at the same time
[13:58:15] <MauriceG> agcolom: what can you confirm?  padding or go through the menu?
[13:58:52] <agcolom> bottom padding is not there when screen is narrow and menu at the bottom
[13:59:49] <MauriceG> agcolom: i mean  go through the menu and the form there
[14:00:25] <agcolom> .type-interior .ui-content {
[14:00:25] <agcolom> padding-bottom: 0;
[14:00:25] <agcolom> }
[14:01:37] <agcolom> jqm-docs line 97
[14:01:56] <agcolom> causes the bottom padding to 0 when the screen is narrow
[14:02:15] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/_assets/css/jqm-docs.css
[14:02:41] <MauriceG> yes!
[14:03:32] <MauriceG> here is the chocolate ... ;-)
[14:04:20] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Cool! It's reproducible on Safari ... great idea!
[14:04:25] <agcolom> btw _|Nix|_ you can try the slide transitions with the Safari browser, even when the screen is wide... same thing happens
[14:05:09] <agcolom> Yes I've found some chocolate but I'll have to get more in at this rate ;-)
[14:06:16] <agcolom> Yes and then I'll have to do more swimming!!!
[14:09:01] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... I've managed to get the transitions working /somehow/ but then I refreshed and now they're broken again ...
[14:09:53] <agcolom> want me to try?
[14:11:28] <_|Nix|_> Well, opening the photo does indeed cause some of the animations to start working, but still no dice on the form and the last menu level  - although I've seen those before ...
[14:12:24] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... The last menu level and the login need a resize before they'll show up ...
[14:13:06] <agcolom> the photo, is it because it is much wider than everything else?
[14:13:27] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: No idea, but one popup should not affect another ...
[14:13:45] <agcolom> I'll try on Safari...
[14:14:22] <_|Nix|_> Very strange ... a resize fixes it every time ...
[14:15:02] <agcolom> a resize will fire some event...
[14:15:23] <agcolom> what if you manually fire that event?
[14:15:40] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I think it triggers a repaint or something, because I get all events I excpect ...
[14:16:00] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I am informed that all animations have completed successfully, and I proceed ...
[14:16:07] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: However, there's nothing on the screen ...
[14:16:14] <agcolom> yes, but maybe you need a repaint
[14:16:29] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I can't exactly repaint from javascript ...
[14:16:33] <agcolom> (i.e. the object is there but not drawn)
[14:16:51] <agcolom> a refresh()
[14:16:52] <agcolom> ?
[14:16:53] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... and besides, that would cause the opening transition to not happen ...
[14:16:59] <agcolom> ok
[14:17:03] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I wonder if this was happening earlier ...
[14:17:29] <agcolom> hang-on I may have an old version...
[14:18:01] <agcolom> Now that popups are in master, is master the same as popup branch?
[14:19:48] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: No ... if you check out popup-widget you get the last thing that happened on that branch ( which is that I merged with master ).
[14:20:44] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: slideup and slidedown never worked ...
[14:21:08] <agcolom> Safari: http://jsbin.com/okehir/65/
[14:22:59] <agcolom> no sorry, wrong one...
[14:23:04] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Form and dialog do not work ...
[14:23:21] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/okehir/75 form3
[14:23:35] <agcolom> I removed the transition
[14:25:39] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/okehir/76/ is better (removed slidup typo)
[14:26:47] <agcolom> I get a js error: TypeError: 'null' is not an object (evaluating 'document.getElementById("latest_line").src=imgArray[target]')
[14:27:19] <agcolom> oups sorry, this is for something else...., please ignore ;-)
[14:27:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Weird that form3 has an opening transition but no closing transition ...
[14:28:24] <agcolom> is it not just getting the default pop opening transition?
[14:28:34] <johnbender>  toddparker http://www.adobe.com/devnet/html5/articles/jquery-mobile-and-rails.html
[14:28:49] <johnbender> same material I talked on at Railsconf
[14:29:48] <agcolom> johnbender Cool stuff :-) ok for the resources page?
[14:30:43] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I think ima call it ... L8R all ...
[14:31:01] <agcolom> later _|Nix|_
[14:32:17] <agcolom> johnbender: if you're happy for me to add, I'll do it now...
[14:32:31] <johnbender> agcolom: ah yah, that's a good idea
[14:36:38] <agcolom> johnbender: it's up.... http://jquerymobile.com/resources/#Articles
[14:36:45] <johnbender> agcolom: thanks!
[14:37:21] <agcolom> you're welcome :-)
[14:48:37] <toddparker> agcolom: new book to add
[14:48:38] <toddparker> http://www.amazon.com/jQuery-Mobile-Develop-Kris-Hadlock/dp/032182041X
[14:48:58] <agcolom> Excellent! I'm updating the articles...
[14:49:35] <agcolom> Oh dear! Who chose that book cover???
[14:50:04] <toddparker> i know, right?
[14:50:17] <toddparker> wonder if there are others we missed
[14:50:18] <toddparker> http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=jquery+mobile
[14:50:27] <toddparker> some aren't jQM here
[14:53:14] <agcolom> all pure jQM are on the resources page except the new one which I'll add now...
[14:53:17] <toddparker> uGoMobi: we may very well do additional maintenance releases for 1.1.x
[14:53:31] <toddparker> guessing we will do a few
[14:53:45] <toddparker> even when 1.2 comes out, some people will stick with 1.1.x
[14:53:54] <toddparker> ok agcolom
[14:55:00] <toddparker> _|Nix|_ and agcolom - this article may be very timely
[14:55:01] <toddparker> http://tripleodeon.com/2011/12/first-understand-your-screen/
[14:55:13] <toddparker> nt sure if UI corrects for all the oddness
[14:55:29] <toddparker> but you can test it easily
[14:56:33] <toddparker> test page
[14:56:33] <toddparker> http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/default.html
[14:56:55] <toddparker> or you could drop it in and see if it helps
[14:57:17] <toddparker> Dependencies
[14:57:18] <toddparker> none (only jQuery core)
[14:59:30] <toddparker> congrats johnbender - great article. just RT
[15:00:06] <johnbender> toddparker: thanks
[15:03:13] <agcolom> toddparker: new book and a few more articles up http://jquerymobile.com/resources/#Books
[15:07:12] <agcolom> toddparker: just realised: we have 2 books that do not have jQM in the title! Do they actually cover jQuery Mobile?
[15:09:04] <agcolom> One thing for sure, that book cover is not going to encourage girls to buy the book!
[15:17:58] <toddparker> dang agcolom, you're FAST
[15:18:02] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: The iOS emulator is surprisingly decent.
[15:18:16] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: You can grab that with XCode. I mean, it’s not _perfect_, but it’s fair.
[15:18:27] <agcolom> wilto: can that run on a PC?
[15:18:41] <Wilto> Er, oh.
[15:18:42] <Wilto> I’unno.
[15:19:00] <agcolom> I think that's his problem ;-)
[15:19:46] <Wilto> I can see what I have kicking around the house for old iOS devices.
[15:20:17] <agcolom> toddparker: I'm the queen of the repetitve task where you just have to do it right and you don't need to think! I find it terribly relaxing ;-)
[15:21:13] <toddparker> glad you were able to help
[15:21:21] <toddparker> and that you guys found a way to repro on safari
[15:21:37] <toddparker> i need to find a way to get people to donate devices
[15:21:44] <agcolom> no problem. Thank you. I love testing stuff as well.
[15:21:57] <toddparker> wonder if i should put up a page asking for devices
[15:22:35] <agcolom> Would be a good idea... How about a list of devices.... donated by .... and devices yet to have
[15:23:12] <uGoMobi> i can donate my device since it just crashed anyway :-(
[15:24:16] <agcolom> we could have a table by brand... then device type and os version
[15:25:48] <agcolom> uGoMobi did the popup crash your device?
[15:26:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: nah it wasn't the popup, already crashed when opening browser
[15:26:36] <agcolom> phew! ;-)
[15:26:49] <uGoMobi> problems since i update to ISC
[15:27:07] <toddparker> agcolom: do you want to take a crack at making a device donation page on staging?
[15:27:19] <uGoMobi> already saw on forums i am not the only one
[15:27:22] <agcolom> ah. never update until all your friend have and said it was safe....
[15:27:35] <toddparker> it could be more of an open-ended "send us test devices" with our office address
[15:27:48] <toddparker> i can then package them up and ship them to people on the team
[15:27:48] <agcolom> toddparker: sure...
[15:28:08] <toddparker> low tech, but that might be fine
[15:28:42] <toddparker> uGoMobi: yeah if you upgraded a 2.3 device to 4.x, you're in a world of hurt
[15:28:58] <uGoMobi> yeah i know by now
[15:29:30] <agcolom> so you don't want a list of devices you already have, right? just a simple message and maybe a note "in particular, we'd be interested in..." and  a few specific ones?
[15:29:32] <uGoMobi> i think i am done with my samsung s2
[15:29:49] <uGoMobi> time for iPhone :)
[15:30:55] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, I think there's no choice now ;-)
[15:31:39] <agcolom> toddparker: is it best to try directly on Wordpress or is it best elsewhere until it's right?
[15:33:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you can save as concept on wordpress
[15:34:17] <toddparker> gseguin: i
[15:34:28] <gseguin> yes sir?
[15:34:36] <toddparker> i've been sending a link or two a day to download builder peeps
[15:34:45] <toddparker> still no issues poplin gup
[15:34:54] <toddparker> but we know there's issues, right?
[15:34:56] <toddparker> sort of funny
[15:34:57] <gseguin> yes
[15:35:03] <gseguin> they
[15:35:11] <gseguin> 're probably not testing
[15:35:18] <gseguin> hard enough
[15:35:39] <uGoMobi> lazy bastards ;-)
[15:36:59] <toddparker> test HARDER people
[15:37:06] <agcolom> ok, I think my eyes are telling me it is bedtime for me ;-) have a great evening/night/afternoon everyone
[15:37:20] <uGoMobi> gseguin: is it possible to pick certain commits from a PR and ignore others?
[15:37:22] <toddparker> gseguin: you still working on that stuff? saw you got the theme/structure stuff working?
[15:37:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: goodnight Anne
[15:37:38] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper
[15:37:42] <gseguin> uGoMobi: not through github's UI
[15:37:51] <gseguin> later agcolom
[15:38:12] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok, thanks
[15:38:22] <gseguin> uGoMobi: you can pull the PR branch locally
[15:38:34] <gseguin> and then cherry-pick into the jQM branch
[15:38:45] <uGoMobi> i see
[15:38:47] <agcolom> enjoy the sunshine gseguin ;-)
[15:39:00] <johnbender> gseguin: agcolom ?
[15:39:08] <johnbender> where's this guy going
[15:39:08] <agcolom> yes
[15:39:09] <gseguin> heh, always!
[15:39:12] <johnbender> no more vacations
[15:39:16] <johnbender> too much to do :D
[15:39:30] <agcolom> no, sorry I was just looking at the weather forecast ;-)
[15:39:37] <johnbender> ah good
[15:39:50] <agcolom> we've had 4 weeks or so of rain here!
[15:39:53] <gseguin> California is like vacation weather everyday coming from France or (worse) the UK
[15:39:59] <johnbender> yar
[15:40:07] <uGoMobi> lol
[15:40:14] <agcolom> It's been the wettest april since records!
[15:40:19] <johnbender> I'm glad it was nice for the tour
[15:40:30] <johnbender> my dad and I enjoyed watching that this weekend
[15:40:42] <johnbender> we're tour (de france) fans
[15:40:48] <johnbender> he used to ride religiously
[15:40:49] <uGoMobi> cool same here
[15:40:50] <agcolom> Oh yes
[15:41:01] <agcolom> My grandad was supposed to do it...
[15:41:03] <gseguin> bunch of doped guys riding bicycles if you ask me
[15:41:16] * johnbender shrugs
[15:41:20] <johnbender> as long as they are all doping
[15:41:36] <agcolom> It's really big in France!!!
[15:41:43] <johnbender> gigantic in france
[15:41:53] <johnbender> some day I'd like to see a few of the stages
[15:42:03] <johnbender> maybe drag my old man with me
[15:42:05] <gseguin> they are but what's unfair is that not all of them get caught
[15:42:13] <johnbender> gseguin: very true
[15:42:20] <agcolom> They've come near my house twice so have seen them a few times... very nice
[15:42:28] * gseguin thinks it would suck to have all competitors disqualified
[15:43:07] <agcolom> Yes, you should definitely. I think the mountain ones must be really interesting
[15:43:31] <uGoMobi> alpe d'huez !
[15:43:41] <uGoMobi> the "Dutch mountain"
[15:44:10] <johnbender> agcolom: it would be amazing, but getting my dad on a plane for something he can watch from the comfort of his home is probably harder than all the pyranees combined
[15:44:21] <johnbender> pyranees stages
[15:44:23] <agcolom> They used to go past my school until the town stopped paying, so the helicopter video stopped at the start of the town and started again as they left!
[15:44:24] <uGoMobi> haha
[15:44:51] <uGoMobi> agcolom: seriously?
[15:45:20] <agcolom> yes, seriously! Towns have to pay to be spoken about with the helicopter video
[15:45:50] <agcolom> johnbender, yes, and west coast flight must be crazy long!
[15:45:55] <uGoMobi> didn't know it is that bad already in cycling too
[15:46:31] <uGoMobi> i thought it was just the dope
[15:47:14] <agcolom> yes, that's when i discovered that as well...
[15:48:00] <agcolom> ok, this time I'm going to bed! Goodnight everyone...
[15:48:13] <uGoMobi> goodnight (again)
