[12:06:38] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] upgrade qunit - John Bender
[12:06:39] <socialhapy> â˜… Commit on jquery-mobile by John Bender (8m, 32s ago): upgrade qunit
[12:06:56] <johnbender> toddparker: not sure if this is going to the be the case on the JQM site but the download on the new QUnit site is nigh impossible to find /cc jzaefferer
[12:07:01] <johnbender> well
[12:07:24] <johnbender> obviously it's possible but I would expect it to be more prominent
[12:08:14] <johnbender> gnarf: was it you that asked about or test output from the grunt qunit task?
[12:08:43] <gnarf> johnbender: i was interested, but i believe it was jzaefferer who was asking about it
[12:10:32] <johnbender> gnarf: it's the regex in grunt's parsing of the results
[12:10:57] <johnbender> I'm not sure there's a general solution for that other than providing a config param
[12:14:30] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker_ johnbender gseguin: I don't have any time to work on this, but I have a proof of concept for init-less widgets with pre-rendered markup: http://temp.nemikor.com/worlds-collide/
[12:16:12] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: cool
[12:16:14] <johnbender> we'll take a look
[12:17:02] <johnbender> jzaefferer: ^
[12:17:14] <johnbender> jzaefferer: -----^
[12:20:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can you pull latest master and try running the phantom suite
[12:46:53] <johnbender> miketayl_r: your website is awesome
[12:47:17] <johnbender> one of these days I'm going to migrate my blog to static pages
[12:53:35] * johnbender might make that today
[12:53:43] <johnbender> miketaylr: ^
[12:53:59] <miketaylr> :D
[12:54:06] <tbenzige> johnbender: jekyll FTW
[12:54:17] <miketaylr> having nothing to lose is a good feeling
[12:54:25] <miketaylr> wrt design
[12:56:19] <johnbender> tbenzige: that's the plan
