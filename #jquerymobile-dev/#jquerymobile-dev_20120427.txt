[05:57:33] <jzaefferer> johnbender: would like to chat about grunt and testing, let me know when you're around
[07:35:02] <Wilto> I’m pretty psyched for Grunt, really.
[07:36:47] <Wilto> Also: hello.
[08:24:40] <JasonDScott> Hey guys, can someone help me out. I am working on the second part of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1970 . From my understanding the 'change' event does not fire on programatic changes.
[08:24:41] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1970 on jquery-mobile (alumni; 9m, 4w ago): checkbox/radio UI: user-select and 'refresh' method
[08:47:19] <gnarf> JasonDScott: true
[08:47:41] <gnarf> JasonDScott: if you manually modify val - you need to trigger change if you want people to listen for it
[08:48:00] <gnarf> we run into that with ui widgets from time to time as well
[08:49:00] <gnarf> I'm having trouble interpreting what that second part of that issue is meaning...
[09:05:34] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I am around!
[10:16:06] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm the <banner:meta.css> reminds me of ant builds - we're shoehorning file manipulation into object literals/json :(
[10:16:40] <johnbender> Makefiles suck tho
[10:16:45] <johnbender> onward and upward
[10:44:27] <johnbender> gseguin: also I'm working on the grunt branch today
[10:44:39] <johnbender> just so we don't collide
[11:04:12] <toddparker> hi all
[11:04:34] <toddparker> thanks gseguin for picking those commits
[11:12:28] <toddparker> johnbender: saw that message re: autodividers
[11:12:47] <toddparker> next week, it would be good to have you and gseguin do some PR reviews
[11:13:14] <toddparker> jason is going to be submitting PRs for fixes too so there should be a few coming in
[11:16:06] <johnbender> toddparker: yah I figured I would split my time between grunt and prs
[11:22:29] <toddparker> cool
[11:22:56] <toddparker> i hate the PRs count against issues
[11:23:04] <toddparker> 44 non-issues
[11:27:30] <johnbender> toddparker: sigh, I had it down to 32 or thereabouts a week ago
[11:27:32] <johnbender> oh well
[11:27:48] <JasonDScott> toddparker: Can you give me some direction of what you want for the second part of this issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1970 Its not very clear. The 'change' event does not fire on programatic changes.
[11:27:49] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1970 on jquery-mobile (alumni; 9m, 4w ago): checkbox/radio UI: user-select and 'refresh' method
[11:27:49] <johnbender> having lots of interest/contributions is a good problem to have
[11:28:40] <toddparker> exactly
[11:28:55] <toddparker> figure the faster we review PRs, the more we might get contribs
[11:29:09] <toddparker> i only trust you two guys to review 'em right now
[11:29:16] <toddparker> and kin, but...
[11:29:22] <johnbender> :D
[11:29:29] <kinblas> eh?
[11:29:40] * kinblas wakes from his coding stupor
[11:29:52] <johnbender> lol
[11:30:09] <johnbender> gseguin: ping
[11:50:39] <toddparker> we don't want you anymore kinblas
[11:50:49] <toddparker> no, just kidding. don't leave us!
[11:50:56] <toddparker> you wanna review PRs??
[12:03:39] <toddparker> johnbender: is this a legit bug? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4195
[12:03:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4195 on jquery-mobile (eugenebond; 3d, 48m ago): <img> tags that use full URL are corrupted when the page is located in a subdirectory and <base> points to a different directoy
[12:07:52] <johnbender> toddparker: our base tag support has issues I think
[12:08:21] <johnbender> that's one that we'll need to let Kin at
[12:08:24] <johnbender> if he has time :d
[12:08:25] <johnbender> kinblas: ^
[12:08:36] <johnbender> I'm pretty sure he's the only person that understands the issue
[12:11:19] <toddparker> heh. i bet.
[12:11:30] <toddparker> that's your baby kinblas
[12:13:24] <Wilto> ♪ It’s a comp-li-cate-d script, and no one under-staaands it but kinblas. ♪
[12:13:37] <Wilto> Sorry, still have the “Shaft” theme song stuck in my head from yesterday. Thanks, Spotify.
[12:13:52] <kinblas> oh that's a known problem btw
[12:13:59] <kinblas> we don't support sub-directory base tags
[12:14:15] <kinblas> or what I meant, we don't support base tags in pages we load dynamically
[12:14:30] <kinblas> that's on our list of things to fix
[12:15:15] <Wilto> ♪ They say those sub-directory base tags are some baaad motha— (Shut yo’ mouth.) I’m talkin’ ’bout sub-directory base tags! (We can dig it.) ♪
[12:16:22] <kinblas> anyways, it's fixable but we're going to have to maintain extra data attribute
[12:16:26] <kinblas> on the pages we suck in
[12:16:31] <kinblas> data-url-base or something like that
[12:18:54] <Wilto> I’ll just see myself out.
[12:38:41] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm pushing my changes to my personal fork at the same branch name
[12:38:48] <johnbender> I needed to rebase and I didn't want to force push
[13:57:04] <toddparker> wilt - nice
[13:57:10] <toddparker> wilto, heh
[13:57:20] <toddparker> so kin - did you comment on that issue?
[13:57:31] <toddparker> should I close as a feature request or leave open as a bug?
[13:57:38] <toddparker> any idea is this is already logged
[13:57:50] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah its already logged/reported
[13:58:02] <kinblas> we (you and me) decided to punt on the issue pre-1.0
[13:58:19] <toddparker> ok
[13:58:27] <toddparker> so i can close this as a dupe
[13:58:35] <toddparker> any idea what you called that issue?
[13:58:57] <toddparker> is this something important we should try to land for 1.2?
[13:59:15] <kinblas> apprarently this is the 2nd or 3rd person that has come across this
[13:59:40] <kinblas> not sure how widespread the practice is
[13:59:45] <kinblas> but in any case we should fix it
[14:22:49] <toddparker> you broke the internets kin
[14:23:11] <kinblas> damn sorry 'bout that
[14:23:17] <kinblas> :-)
[14:23:22] <agcolom> hi :-)
[14:23:43] <kinblas> agcolom: hey
[14:24:01] <toddparker> hi agcolom!
[14:24:11] <agcolom> just to let you know that I'm getting setup with git... it might take the whole weekend!!!
[14:24:26] <toddparker> heh
[14:24:27] <agcolom> Ghislain is being really helpful
[14:24:44] <toddparker> once you're set up, you won't know how you lived without it
[14:24:59] <toddparker> so all your pulls have been via the web UI?
[14:25:01] <agcolom> Yes I'm sure!
[14:25:04] <Wilto> Woah, hey agcolom.
[14:25:14] <agcolom> Yep, I've done everything on GH!
[14:25:19] <Wilto> Welcome to Nerdtowne USA.
[14:25:21] <agcolom> hi!
[14:26:11] <toddparker> didn't know that
[14:26:14] <agcolom> BTW sorry about yesterday, I pressed the mic button thinking I was turning it on, and I turned it off!!! bad UI!!! then it froze and I couldn't talk!
[14:26:28] <toddparker> google = bad ui? never.
[14:27:27] <agcolom> anyway at the moment if I do a fetch, I fetch agcolom/jquerymobile which is not up to date
[14:28:11] <agcolom> do I need to change the origin or update my agcolom/jquerymobile and then always work on that?
[14:35:57] <agcolom> I think I'm going to read the o'reilly book on git this weekend... It's somewhere in the house, I just have to find it! Have a great weekend everyone...
[14:44:03] <toddparker> agcolom: from now on, when you're making docs changes yourself, you can be working in jquerymobile/master (which is 1.2-pre)
[14:44:55] <toddparker> if the docs change is appropriate for 1.1.x, then you want to use the cherry pick command to copy that change over to the 1.1-stable branch which is where we do all our maintenance release from (1.1.1)
[14:45:15] <toddparker> when i doubt, ask first :)
[14:46:44] <toddparker> johnbender: what was that good git reference you had?
[14:47:49] <toddparker> I thought you knew more git-fu so you should probably continue to do PRs until you get comfortable
[14:48:34] <agcolom> todd, yes in github that's no problem.
[14:49:57] <johnbender> toddparker: progit
[14:50:13] <johnbender> progit.org/book/
[14:50:17] <agcolom> Once I've done the circle once of getting the latest version making the change and uploading it, I'll be fine, but I do not want to make mistakes
[14:50:23] <agcolom> I'll have a look.
[14:50:33] <agcolom> Thanks John.
[14:55:04] <johnbender> although I can't  seem to reach the site right now :(
[14:55:29] <agcolom> I can't either :( hopefully it's temporary?
[14:56:24] <agcolom> just to check with you, at the moment if I do a fetch, I fetch agcolom/jquerymobile which is not up to date so do I need to change the origin or update my agcolom/jquerymobile and then always work on that?
[15:01:16] <agcolom> the other option is I do some work on github at the weekend and I'll have to learn to cherry-pick.
[15:13:43] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone, it's bedtime for me... (23.13pm)
[15:22:43] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/ is working for me
[15:22:48] <toddparker> or is github down?
[15:22:59] <toddparker> anyway, heading out so you all have a great weekend!
[15:28:51] <gseguin> oh wow looks like I missed the party
[18:05:47] <johnbender> gseguin: I've been comparing build output using a recursive diff
[18:05:57] <johnbender> so I build with the current setup
[18:06:00] <johnbender> and then diff
[18:06:07] <johnbender> so far so good
[18:06:11] <gseguin> ok
[18:06:30] <johnbender> gseguin: the makefile has been completely slimmed down
[18:06:31] <gseguin> for the grunt task right?
[18:06:37] <gseguin> nice
[18:06:43] <johnbender> gseguin: this is just the migration to bash scripts
[18:07:43] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/johnbender/jquery-mobile/blob/grunt/Makefile
[18:10:40] <johnbender> gseguin: on Monday I can start in on the grunt version
[20:33:49] <gseguin> johnbender: I like!
[23:53:10] <johnbender> gseguin: yah it's getting there
[23:53:23] <johnbender> hopefully I can get this done without too much pain
[23:53:34] <johnbender> first thing I'll probably do on monday is setup an automated check
[23:54:18] <johnbender> testing each build target is pretty much identical save for deploy which requires some extra work
[23:54:49] <johnbender> make clean && make <target> && diff -r compiled ../other-jqm-dir/compiled
[23:55:03] <johnbender> if there's anything but the build sha comments in the output there's a probelm
[23:55:06] <johnbender> *problem
[23:55:46] <johnbender> If I could easily exclude those I'd be happy to do an md5 but it's not easy :/
[23:57:16] <gnarf> johnbender: cat | grep -v "pattern" | openssl md5 ?
