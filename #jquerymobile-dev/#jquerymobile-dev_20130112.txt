[10:26:02] <maxlynch> toddmparker: per our discussion, one thing that would help make theme development easier which I'm sure you guys have discussed many times is using a CSS preprocessor.
[10:30:08] <maxlynch> Pulling out some of the CSS comments that are essentially identifiers (like 'a-bar-background-start') and putting them into preprocessor variables, though this would require a change with TR I believe

[14:10:15] <gseguin> uGoMobi: can you tell me about the twitters boots trap? ;)
[14:14:27] <agcolom> gseguin: hello!
[14:14:40] <gseguin> hey agcolom 
[14:14:44] <gseguin> how goes it?
[14:15:01] <agcolom> good! I'm adding the panels but I have a bug! 
[14:15:25] <agcolom> only for right reveal panel... all the others are fine....
[14:15:42] <agcolom> some crazy temperatures where you are...
[14:16:33] <agcolom> how are you?
[14:16:38] <gseguin> yeah was -20C this morning
[14:17:01] <gseguin> doing good, been busy with Jive
[14:17:31] <gseguin> but I'm coming back to my 40% time with jQM very soon
[14:17:43] <agcolom> that'll be really good ;-)
[14:17:45] <gseguin> kinda miss it :)
[14:17:49] <agcolom> yes! 
[14:18:10] <agcolom> Same here... Was so good to spend the whole friday afternoon/evening doing jqm stuff!
[14:18:29] <gseguin> how are you? holidays were good?
[14:19:11] <agcolom> holidays were very good! I was so exhausted... I could not even open my computer for a few days! I feel much better now... Semester 1 was a killer!
[14:19:29] <agcolom> Did you have just a few days?
[14:19:40] <gseguin> yeah couple days off
[14:19:50] <gseguin> worked most of the time
[14:20:14] <gseguin> I'm taking some time off around JSConf
[14:20:25] <gseguin> can't wait for that
[14:20:33] <agcolom> will be nice! 
[14:20:56] <gseguin> yeah it's too bad that none of the jQMobros will be there
[14:21:24] <agcolom> but I think some jQuery bros will ;-)
[14:21:40] <gseguin> yep for sure
[14:21:43] <agcolom> (I think Adam is going?) 
[14:22:11] <gseguin> yup he got ticket number 69 I think
[14:22:27] <gseguin> I believe I saw a tweet like that
[14:22:32] <agcolom> yeah I remember him tweeting about it ;-)
[14:22:50] <agcolom> Adam and Scott G have been totally amazing with the api docs btw! 
[14:23:22] <agcolom> And Adam helped me get a local setup, so I no longer push blindly ;-)
[14:26:05] <agcolom> Looking forward to monday.... Will be a nice birthday present for Todd :-)
[14:28:50] <gseguin> sweet !
[14:29:32] <gseguin> is it what's on stage.api.jquerymobile.com ?

[14:57:13] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 146a40081 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: adding missing class to example for panel
[15:00:14] <agcolom> uGoMobi: just in case you see this, do yoy know why the reveal right panel is not working properly in this example? http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/resources/panel/example1.html (I must be missing something... just thought I'd ask you as it may be must more obvious to you ;-) I've copied the code from the current docs http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/panels/index.html but I may have forgotten s
[15:00:14] <agcolom> omething... Thank you :-)
[15:00:31] <uGoMobi> hi agcolom 
[15:00:32] <agcolom> will check tomorrow now... 
[15:00:37] <agcolom> og hi uGoMobi !
[15:00:43] <agcolom> oh! ^
[15:01:11] <uGoMobi> the panel refactor is still in a branch
[15:01:20] <agcolom> I've done the api doc entry for panels based on http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/panels/index.html 
[15:01:23] <uGoMobi> on master they are broken
[15:01:32] <agcolom> oh, right... 
[15:01:33] <uGoMobi> you dont see that in the "old" docs
[15:01:43] <agcolom> no...
[15:01:52] <uGoMobi> because there is a panel before the page content
[15:02:00] <agcolom> ah! 
[15:02:01] <uGoMobi> thats masks the problem
[15:02:07] <agcolom> ok ;-)
[15:02:19] <uGoMobi> there are some mistakes in the CSS selectors that were used there
[15:02:23] <agcolom> ok, so when the problem is fixed my example will work?
[15:02:39] <uGoMobi> let me check the example
[15:02:56] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:02:57] <agcolom> you can see the iframe at http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/resources/panel/example1.html
[15:03:01] <uGoMobi> that will work
[15:03:15] <agcolom> fantastic :-)
[15:03:30] <agcolom> So I can go to bed and relax now then ;-)
[15:03:30] <uGoMobi> have been working on fix for iOS
[15:03:38] <agcolom> whow. 
[15:03:39] <uGoMobi> so we can test monday
[15:03:44] <agcolom> not easy....
[15:03:50] <uGoMobi> and merge in master
[15:04:02] <uGoMobi> yeah, if I fix one iOS I brake another
[15:04:09] <uGoMobi> bit of a puzzle
[15:04:20] <uGoMobi> but I think I got it
[15:04:27] <agcolom> (i was keen to get the entry done before monday...) just in case people check...
[15:04:47] <agcolom> uGoMobi: oh that be good. 
[15:05:02] <agcolom> your brain must need a rest by now ;-)
