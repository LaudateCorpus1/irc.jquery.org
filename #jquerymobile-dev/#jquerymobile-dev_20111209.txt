[07:22:16] <Wilto> ’Morning, guys
[08:52:34] <johnbender> kinblas: commented on your comment in the comments on the branch message in the basecampe commentary
[08:52:50] <johnbender> :P
[08:57:11] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah the maintenance branch is really just a patch-based branch
[08:57:41] <kinblas> that is, the goal is to only release if necessary from that branch, and if it is necessary its for fixes that folks need
[08:58:01] <kinblas> ... minimize dot releases ... off the last major release
[09:05:01] <johnbender> kinblas: what do you mean "minimize dot releases"
[09:05:57] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm 99% sure we're on the same page
[09:06:40] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:07:55] <johnbender> gseguin: buenos dias
[09:08:05] <kinblas> johnbender: I just meant in general folks try *NOT* to do dot releases if they can help it so that they can concentrate on the next *BIG* release with new features
[09:08:33] <gseguin> johnbender: I failed moving the regexps from the hacked r.js (r-jqm.js) to the makefile yesterday
[09:08:40] <kinblas> I mean dot release as in a "maintenance" release that fixes the things that have been bugging people
[09:08:42] <gseguin> effing sed, I hate it
[09:09:01] <gseguin> it wasn't as simple as I was hoping
[09:09:06] <johnbender> kinblas: have you had a chance to read the semantic versioning document?
[09:09:22] <kinblas> johnbender: not yet
[09:09:34] <kinblas> guess it would help to sync our semantics eh? :-
[09:09:35] <kinblas> :-)
[09:09:39] <johnbender> kinblas: :D
[09:09:48] <johnbender> whenever you get a chance
[09:10:13] <johnbender> so in this case patch release is the y in 1.x.y
[09:10:26] <johnbender> minor version is the x
[09:10:29] <johnbender> and 1 is  the major
[09:10:42] <johnbender> and it has guidance on what can be included in each
[09:11:09] <kinblas> ok yeah that would be good to read :-)
[11:44:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: have you guys given any consideratio to my proposed branching strategy?

[13:08:39] <kinblas> johnbender: nice work
[13:15:15] <Wilto> You’re a machine, man.
[13:19:01] <johnbender> I wish, most of that was cruft
[13:19:05] <johnbender> still a ways to go
[13:25:59] <Wilto> I’m officially stumped by the “anchor linking” Basecamp thread.
[13:26:21] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #333: FAILURE in 15 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/333/

[13:29:42] <johnbender> spurious failure
[13:29:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I responded on basecam
[13:39:06] <toddmparker_> thanks johnbender
[13:39:09] <toddmparker_> i did too
[13:39:18] <toddmparker_> like your idea
[13:41:42] <Wilto> Yeah, seconded.
[14:01:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/W-3wiQ
[14:01:27] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3171 from eddiemonge/issue_3169.2 - John Bender
[14:06:18] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2778/files any chance you could spend like 20 mins on that
[14:06:19] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by ronchalant (1m, 2w ago): Fix for potential issues with getInheritedTheme
[14:07:12] <kinblas> johnbender: there's a reason it's implemented that way .... speed
[14:08:25] <kinblas> so he just wants to fn'itize it?
[14:10:19] <johnbender> kinblas: I guess the original issue isn't an issue because we're only supporting single letter swatches
[14:10:28] <johnbender> I'm going to close the pr then
[14:11:32] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm not opposed, but along with that pull-request, they should show us that it's not going to introduce any perf penalties
[14:11:41] <kinblas> with the parents() and the each() call they introduce
[14:12:32] <kinblas> I say that because it gets used whenever some of the widgets are enhanced
[14:12:40] <kinblas> and we don't want to step backwards
[14:12:49] <kinblas> enhanced, or refreshed
[14:12:51] <kinblas> I should say
[14:13:35] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm going to close it and ask him to comment if he can show with a jsperf there's no perf degredation
[14:13:47] <kinblas> okie dokie
[14:13:51] <johnbender> kinblas: another thing we need to establish is when a $.fn or $. extension is warrated
[14:14:05] <johnbender> I've added a couple that could just as easil be .mobil functions
[14:14:18] <kinblas> johnbender: right we need to be careful about polluting .fn
[14:14:30] <johnbender> which at least denotes that it's ours and that it's not a public api
[14:14:37] <kinblas> maybe more of an issue once folks start pulling in other plugins
[14:14:45] <johnbender> yes
[14:14:53] <kinblas> before that can happen we need to implement the Don't touch this container feature
[14:15:54] <toddmparker_> http://discuss.zoho.com/getCustomFile.do?fileId=14737000001669475&forumGroupId=14737000000003003
[14:16:15] <toddmparker_> yeah, we need to still add that feature kinblas
[14:16:31] <toddmparker_> did we already make an issue for that? thought you did, right?
[14:16:39] <kinblas> LOL
[14:17:00] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah we have 2
[14:17:13] <kinblas> one with turning off link handling underneath a container
[14:17:14] <toddmparker_> cool, that's what I thought
[14:17:19] <toddmparker_> you like?
[14:17:19] <kinblas> and the other for not enhancing
[14:17:29] <kinblas> toddmparker_: that's a trick question
[14:17:32] <toddmparker_> right
[14:17:32] <kinblas> it was funny
[14:17:36] <toddmparker_> heh
[14:17:42] <kinblas> homey don't fall for that
[14:18:26] <toddmparker_> so how goes?
[14:18:54] <kinblas> toddmparker_: with me? I have 2 bugs left I'm fixing
[14:18:57] <kinblas> internally
[14:18:58] <kinblas> :-D
[14:19:03] <toddmparker_> boo
[14:19:46] <toddmparker_> so did we land on a decision with branches?
[14:20:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'd like to see people respond I guess
[14:20:17] <kinblas> yeah I think John and I were saying essentially the same thing, I just didn't read his doc pointer yet
[14:20:18] <johnbender> kin and I are on the same page I think
[14:20:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto
[14:20:30] <johnbender> gseguin:
[14:20:41] <kinblas> scottjehl:
[14:20:47] <johnbender> it would be great if you haven't already to read the semver document
[14:20:50] <toddmparker_> i'll defer to your guys + gseguin
[14:21:25] <toddmparker_> bender and his homework
[14:21:38] <johnbender> :D
[14:22:01] <Wilto> Sup?
[14:22:58] <Wilto> Kinda off the grid today, thanks to some very poor planning on my part. Am I gonna get any points off if I read it by monday?
[14:23:07] <Wilto> My GPA is already hurtin’, here.
[14:23:26] <johnbender> Wilto: nope, it's short too but it's mostly important for understanding what can go into which branches we'll have
[14:23:35] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[14:23:36] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #334: FIXED in 12 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/334/
[14:23:36] <jqm-jenkins-bot> eddie: Not using YUI for js so removing this line
[14:23:40] <johnbender> since they're split based on the semantic versions
[14:24:11] <Wilto> Sweet. Expect a book report on Monday, then.
[14:25:56] <gseguin> johnbender: where is that doc?
[14:26:48] <johnbender> gseguin: semver.org
[14:27:21] <gseguin> thanks
[14:41:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/MP3kHg

[15:06:45] <toddmparker_> alright guys, heading home
[15:07:00] <toddmparker_> y'all have super weekends
