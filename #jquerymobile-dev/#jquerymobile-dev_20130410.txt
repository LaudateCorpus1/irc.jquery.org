[05:16:52] <arschmitz> Morning All
[05:21:51] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:24:34] <frequent> morning
[05:25:14] <arschmitz> morning frequent
[05:25:43] <frequent> so we are the IRC earlybirds?
[05:26:10] <arschmitz> yeah uGoMobi: and _|Nix|_ are normally first
[05:26:35] <arschmitz> i get here around normally about 7:30 EST so about an hour ago
[05:27:20] <frequent> am I the only one east of the Atlantic? 
[05:27:36] <arschmitz> no uGoMobi is in amsterdam 
[05:27:44] <arschmitz> and _|Nix|_ is in finland
[05:27:54] <frequent> ah. almost neighbours. I'm in Lille right now.
[05:27:59] <frequent> ok. cool.
[05:28:16] <arschmitz> oh and cant forget agcolom in england
[05:29:53] <frequent> good to know

[05:44:10] <uGoMobi> lunch... brb
[05:53:44] <frequent> arschmitz: may I pick your brain?
[05:53:50] <arschmitz> sure
[05:55:03] <frequent> I have a site that's using i18n and when I'm switching languages, I'm left with a whole bunch of JQM inputs (selects, buttons, etc) all needing to be refreshed to reflect the new language. 
[05:55:35] <frequent> I can add a class to all inputs, but can I anyonymously "refresh" widgets?
[05:56:10] <arschmitz> hmm
[05:56:44] <arschmitz> if you know what widgets exactly are in there
[05:56:53] <frequent> yes
[05:57:29] <arschmitz> you can do $(":slider").slider("refresh");
[05:57:56] <frequent> ah yes. The widget-pseudo. Good idea.
[05:57:59] <arschmitz> actually better to be on the safe side
[05:58:15] <arschmitz> $(":data(slider)")
[05:58:39] <arschmitz> if for some reason no :slider elements were found the first one would throw an error
[05:58:47] <frequent> this looks like an awesomely fast selector :-)
[05:59:02] <frequent> ok will try both. Thanks
[05:59:10] <arschmitz> yeah not really pseudo and attribute selectors are the slowest ones
[05:59:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Ping!
[05:59:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: morning
[05:59:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You wanna talk about the widget refactor some more?
[05:59:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hey!
[06:00:32] <arschmitz> sure can you just give me a few minutes to finish something up?
[06:00:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For sure!
[06:00:54] <arschmitz> cool
[06:01:02] <_|Nix|_> Wow! Seriously? :ns-widget selectors throw an error if they evaluate to nothing?
[06:01:28] <arschmitz> havent tried my self but scott_gonzalez warned me about it the other day
[06:02:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1avua2a3QLtUdcFyRcX67FsVTKyFTpGdtJiBpg-AMvKo/edit
[06:02:25] <arschmitz> see scotts comments about it there
[06:02:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird ... I loaded the front page and ran $( ":mobile-slider" ) ... it returned the empty set.
[06:03:06] <arschmitz> hmm maybe he meant exists as in has not been loaded
[06:03:17] <arschmitz> so like if you excluded slider from the build
[06:04:53] <arschmitz> <scott_gonzalez> [13:20:17] Let me find an example where it woudl break.
[06:04:53] <arschmitz> <scott_gonzalez> [13:20:28] https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.dialog.js#L553
[06:04:53] <arschmitz> <scott_gonzalez> [13:20:50] If that used the widget-specific selector, it would throw an error if the resizable widget wasn't loaded.
[06:05:30] <arschmitz> i had thought he meant initalized on an element but looking back im thinking he means if the js for it isnt loaded
[06:05:36] <_|Nix|_> Oh, wait! If the widget wasn't loaded!
[06:05:53] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, well, definitely, if it's not loaded, it will be an invalid selector.
[06:05:59] <arschmitz> yup
[06:06:21] <_|Nix|_> We have AMD to take care of that, although it's not immediately obvious that using the selector requires that you depend on the widget.
[06:06:31] <arschmitz> i think when he said widget exists in the comments it threw me off
[06:06:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Me too.
[06:07:02] <arschmitz> makes more sense now
[06:15:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: When we do this refactor, we should always run a before/after jsperf.
[06:16:01] <arschmitz> yup
[06:16:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... where we create a widget.
[06:16:15] <arschmitz> yeah create is where we need to be effecient

[07:09:29] <toddmparker> hi all
[07:09:53] <toddmparker> if we're in good shape, we can do 1.3.1 in a bit - what's the status?
[07:10:20] <toddmparker> i was in a 6 hour road trip yesterday with bad connectivity so i was out of it
[07:10:21] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker 
[07:10:41] <uGoMobi> how was breaking dev?
[07:13:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we need to change the extention of some files in the demos
[07:14:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: gseguin|away suggests to release 1.3.2 right away
[07:14:41] <toddmparker> heh
[07:15:00] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: breaking dev was really great
[07:15:04] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[07:16:29] <uGoMobi> I wonder if we can't just replace the zip on the CDN
[07:16:50] <uGoMobi> don't really like the idea of declaring 1.3.1 DOA and release 1.3.2
[07:17:39] <uGoMobi> just because the JS isn't loaded on a few demo pages
[07:27:21] <toddmparker> agreed
[07:27:34] <toddmparker> this wasn't officially tagged as 1.3.1, was it?
[07:27:46] <toddmparker> this is a demo build issue
[07:27:52] <toddmparker> not a code change
[07:31:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the tag is there already
[07:31:55] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: but it is indeed just a demo issue
[07:32:50] <uGoMobi> or actually a zip build script issue
[07:48:34] <gseguin> it's a build issue
[07:48:46] <gseguin> mornin'
[07:48:52] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[07:59:04] <agcolom> Hi All, quick Hello from Paris! (I have some interenet for about 20 minutes!)
[07:59:16] <uGoMobi> bonjour agcolom 
[07:59:25] <agcolom> Hey Jasper! 
[07:59:29] <gseguin> salut agcolom 
[07:59:30] <uGoMobi> how's your vacation?
[07:59:45] <agcolom> Very relaxing! But the weather is not great!
[08:00:05] <gseguin> hey you're in Paris, what do you expect?
[08:00:37] <agcolom> Two years ago it was really hot and sunny and got to have naps in the sun everyday ;-)
[08:01:25] <agcolom> but can't wait to get back on the docs! ;-) and testing ;-)
[08:01:41] <uGoMobi> haha
[08:02:34] <agcolom> it's crazy, I go to bed at 11pm, and get up at 10am! (the 1st week I'd get up at 11am!) so I am really catching up with my sleep!
[08:07:10] <uGoMobi> that sounds good :)
[08:08:18] <gseguin> toddmparker: what do you think of letting go of either skipping 1.3.1 or immediatly releasing 1.3.2
[08:08:22] <gseguin> ?
[08:10:56] <gseguin> s/letting go//
[08:11:16] <gseguin> uGoMobi: did you rename the guilty files?
[08:11:42] <uGoMobi> gseguin: no, not yet
[08:11:59] <uGoMobi> gseguin: wanted to wait until we had a plan
[08:12:33] <uGoMobi> gseguin: should we revert last commit in 1.3-stable?
[08:12:46] * gseguin looks
[08:12:49] <uGoMobi> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/a152a8f184967116c2155ecbd786d8db9357ac86
[08:13:05] <gseguin> no
[08:13:10] <gseguin> that's wanted
[08:13:13] <uGoMobi> that didn't work, right? or is it still better?
[08:13:15] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[08:13:32] <gseguin> this is the reason why the structure and theme files did not get uploaded to the CDN
[08:14:12] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[08:19:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker scottjehl Wilto : shall we do a hangout about theming/markup? 
[08:39:29] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I'll work on the builder for now
[08:40:38] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok
[08:42:22] <uGoMobi> there are ~ 20 files with .html extension

[08:42:25] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 143abbdb2 15Gabriel Schulhof: Popup: Centralize option setting.
[08:42:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Have a look at ^
[08:42:37] <uGoMobi> I can rename them and a look for links to those files
[08:43:08] <uGoMobi> but would be nice if we can fix the cause
[08:43:22] <uGoMobi> seems a more solid solution to me
[08:44:16] <gseguin> uGoMobi: OK, so we process html files in secondpass as well
[08:44:34] <gseguin> and that should workâ„¢
[08:44:35] <uGoMobi> gseguin: if possible
[08:56:23] <uGoMobi> I will be back in a hour
[08:57:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool looks good since popup does not really seem like it would need refresh
[08:58:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and the perf is almost identical, except in FF, but FF always accentuates performance differences.
[08:58:35] <arschmitz> i like this approach and in some widgets like table or others that need to reapply certain options durring refresh refresh can just call setoptions with those specific options 
[08:58:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly!
[08:58:51] <arschmitz> but that will be widget specific
[08:59:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Funny you should mention tables ... do you realize that if we make reflow/columntoggle an option (currently "mode"), then we promise the user the ability to switch between them :)
[08:59:39] <arschmitz> yes
[08:59:55] <arschmitz> i have a widget i wrote that has options like that
[08:59:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know we agreed that not all options shall be on-the-fly settable, but it's an interesting implication.
[09:00:16] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#283 (master - 3abbdb2 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build is still failing.

[09:00:24] <_|Nix|_> What ?!
[09:00:29] <_|Nix|_> Why's the build failing ... ?
[09:00:34] <arschmitz> i think all options should be on the fly i think we should move anything thats not going to be on the fly to defaults
[09:00:43] <arschmitz> it fails all the time randomly
[09:00:56] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: it's still these nav tests I thinkg
[09:00:57] <_|Nix|_> K, weird ...
[09:01:26] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, expecting pagechange is always flaky.
[09:01:39] <gseguin> yup: tests/integration/navigation/push-state-disabled-tests.html
[09:01:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I have to go buy some juice now, but when I get back in the saddle, I'll tackle another widget.
[09:01:55] <arschmitz> yup its the disable link binding test this time
[09:02:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok give me a shout when your back have something i want to show you
[09:08:14] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: is there a way to stabilize that test?
[09:08:36] <gseguin> false negatives are very annoying
[09:09:31] <arschmitz> gseguin not sure if related but on jenkins they just started failing one day for no reason
[09:09:56] <arschmitz> no related commits nothing 
[09:10:04] <gseguin> hmm
[09:10:16] <arschmitz> we had chalked it up to something with the server
[09:11:07] <gseguin> We need to spend time on figuring it out I think
[09:11:07] <arschmitz> happened durring RC for 1.3 if i recall and only changes made within 20 commits were just demos
[09:41:19] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: fire drill on a client project so we're on that for mod tot today unfortunately. grr
[09:41:48] <toddmparker> gseguin: i don't think we can/should skip a version just because we had a deploy hiccup. seems like it would be very ood.
[09:41:49] <toddmparker> odd.
[09:42:47] <gseguin> toddmparker: it's a build issue not a deploy issue
[09:43:00] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: we broke out tables as two separate extensions so you can pick which one you might need. merging = overhead if you only need one.
[09:43:11] <gseguin> toddmparker: but I'm fine with keeping 1.3.1's zip broken
[09:43:21] <toddmparker> gseguin: well, same kinda thing.the library itself hasn't rev'd
[09:43:23] <gseguin> toddmparker: we just need to fix it and release 1.3.2 quickly
[09:43:37] <toddmparker> wait. why can't we fix 1.3.1's zip?
[09:44:03] <gseguin> true but if we fix only the zip on the CDN, no one pulling 1.3.1 tag will be able to generate the same zip
[09:44:17] <gseguin> does that make sense?
[09:44:20] <toddmparker> we knew there would be some issues switching to the new setup, this was kind of expected. but doesn't seem like it should have any impact on what library version we release.
[09:44:35] <toddmparker> oh, i see.
[09:44:45] <gseguin> because it's been tagged
[09:44:56] <toddmparker> if the only diff is the ability to generate the zip, that's not a big deal imho
[09:45:06] <toddmparker> that code is really for us anyway
[09:45:27] <toddmparker> normally, we didn't tag until things were working right
[09:45:39] <toddmparker> do we have to tag for the new process to work?
[09:45:42] <gseguin> ok, then once we have a fix in the Gruntfile.js I'll copy it to a 1.3.1 checkout and regenerate the zip then upload it to CDN
[09:45:50] <toddmparker> if so, we should have tagged as 1.3.1-pre or something
[09:46:02] <toddmparker> cool, thanks!
[09:47:10] <gseguin> the concept of tagging is that once you push your tag, you don't touch it anymore
[09:47:29] <gseguin> so having a 1.3.1-pre tag doesn't really make sense
[09:47:45] <gseguin> we thought everything was looking good
[09:48:00] <gseguin> that's why I hit `release`
[09:52:19] <toddmparker> i see
[09:52:33] <toddmparker> the zip always causes issues
[10:15:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I know that's a very bad thing but I think we have deleted a tag before
[10:16:24] <uGoMobi> s/that's/that it's/
[10:17:25] <gseguin> yeah I don't think it's justified though
[10:17:35] <gseguin> We can fix the zip on the CDN
[10:18:09] <gseguin> and fix it in the build for 1.3.2+
[10:18:50] <uGoMobi> okay
[10:19:34] <uGoMobi> maybe even a link to a new zip in the blog post as well?/
[10:21:29] <gseguin> uGoMobi: doesn't the blog post link to the zip on the CDN ?
[10:21:51] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ah, of course
[10:21:54] <uGoMobi> nevermind
[10:23:09] <uGoMobi> ok, what's steps needs to be taken to get 1.3.1 out and who is doing what?
[10:23:49] <uGoMobi> we also have that issue with "version dev"
[10:23:57] <gseguin> I have to fix the Gruntfile.js and import it into a checked out 1.3.1 then build the zip and export it to CDN
[10:24:15] <gseguin> that's not really an issue it's the way view workss
[10:24:32] <gseguin> When we tag, view checks out and build
[10:24:33] <gseguin> s
[10:24:55] <gseguin> so when you show up at view/1.3.1 you're in the workspace not in the dist part
[10:25:37] <gseguin> what we could do, as part of the build is create an index.html that redirects to dist/ in the root
[10:25:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yes, but the extensions are activated via an option. Thus, you promise that you can switch to the other extension just by changing the value of the option. Easier promised than delivered.
[10:25:55] <gseguin> and add that index.html to .gitignore
[10:26:05] <uGoMobi> ok, but are we going to make sure you see "version 1.3.1" when you visit http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/demos/?
[10:26:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, if you choose both, we are bound by our promise - technically.
[10:27:06] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and gseguin - once the zip and view. sites are looking good, we can ship
[10:27:40] <gseguin> toddmparker: k
[10:27:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The good news is that tables are implemented in fairly little code, so it might actually not be that difficult to deliver on that promise.
[10:28:06] <gseguin> I think I've identified the builder problem, working on it now
[10:28:18] <uGoMobi> cool
[10:29:18] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: not sure I follow
[10:30:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Suppose both extensions are loaded and mode="reflow". What if I $( ".table" ).table( "option", "mode", "columntoggle" ); ?
[10:30:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: By implementing mode as an option we promise that the above code will turn a reflow table into a columntoggle table.
[10:30:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Again, I don't think we need to deliver on that promise, but we /are/ making it.
[10:35:40] <toddmparker> hmm
[10:39:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i dont really think this is a problem
[10:39:18] <arschmitz> i think its relativly easy to implement a little extra code yes
[10:39:29] <arschmitz> but also something someone may potentially want to do 
[10:41:07] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: so this would need to destroy reflow and then call column toggle 
[10:41:39] <arschmitz> not destroy
[10:41:50] <arschmitz> but undo it and reset it up 
[10:50:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: What arschmitz said :)
[10:50:37] <toddmparker> gotcha.

[13:35:22] <toddmparker> hi all
[13:38:39] <uGoMobi> gseguin|away: ok I am going to test now
[13:47:43] <uGoMobi> looks good
[13:48:57] <uGoMobi> global search still doesn't work when you hit enter
[13:49:19] <uGoMobi> not sure why that is
[13:49:42] <uGoMobi> in 1.3.0 it works on view.
[13:56:41] <toddmparker> so odd
[13:56:55] <uGoMobi> just tested 1.3.0 zi
[13:56:57] <uGoMobi> zip*
[13:57:03] <uGoMobi> was already broken in there
[13:57:25] <toddmparker> huh
[13:57:44] <uGoMobi> might have to do with php being required for search?
[14:00:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You were saying something about classes and something the factory provides to automagically toggle classes in response to option changes. Can you please send me that link again?
[14:02:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its actually from tj_vantoll http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/65050459/Classes%20Option
[14:03:04] <arschmitz> its just a proposed change nothing we can use yet
[14:03:21] <arschmitz> they want our input on it
[14:04:34] <arschmitz> hey gota run though
[14:04:49] <arschmitz> going to see Bob Dylan tonight lol
[14:08:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice! Have fun!
[14:10:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the problem with the search is that we use changePage which doesn't work locally
[14:10:33] <uGoMobi> the swipe to navigate demo is broken too
[14:10:55] <uGoMobi> we have a warning for this at the bottom of each page
[14:11:58] <uGoMobi> I am starting to think including demos in the zip might be something we want to reconsider
[14:12:28] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: but doesn't search work if you click with the mouse?
[14:12:39] <toddmparker> that was the issue for me. arrow + return = broken
[14:13:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes, but with a mouse click it's just a regular link
[14:13:25] <uGoMobi> we use a script to make enter work
[14:14:21] <uGoMobi> has to do with form submitting
[14:14:32] <toddmparker> oh, gotcha
[14:15:05] <toddmparker> could we trigger a click?
[14:15:18] <uGoMobi> was thinking about that
[14:15:19] <uGoMobi> testing
[14:30:38] <gseguin> uGoMobi: so? Should I cherry-pick and regenerate a zip for 1.3.1 ?
[14:31:14] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes, you can cherry-pick
[14:31:26] <uGoMobi> gseguin: but I am still looking at the search issue

[14:38:17] <toddmparker> I'm all ready to roll on the site
[14:38:31] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: if it's a quick fix, fine
[14:38:39] <toddmparker> if not, we can fix it for 1.3.2
[14:38:46] <toddmparker> (autocomplete)
[14:39:11] <toddmparker> gseguin: you're back from your appointment? everything ok?
[14:39:33] <gseguin> toddmparker: I most likely need surgery (light one though)
[14:39:49] <toddmparker> yikes...
[14:39:58] <toddmparker> nothing too serious?
[14:41:26] <gseguin> neh, a piece of cartilage is loose in my right knee, they just need to poke a hole for the tweezers and one for the light
[14:43:19] <gseguin> toddmparker: I'm still having a slight path issue on 1.3-stable, working on it
[14:43:41] <gseguin> in other news, the builder hasn't crashed since I patched it
[14:43:43] <gseguin> yay!
[14:43:45] <uGoMobi> fix for search seems to work
[14:44:05] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: nice
[14:44:15] <toddmparker> so once you land that, let's do this
[14:44:26] <toddmparker> shoot for next 30 minutes?
[14:47:15] <gseguin> so wait
[14:47:24] <gseguin> how are we doing this
[14:47:26] <gseguin> ?
[14:47:32] <gseguin> it's already been tagged
[14:47:38] <gseguin> what's your fix uGoMobi?
[14:48:26] <uGoMobi> hmm... still doesn't work as expected in the zip
[14:48:36] <uGoMobi> going to leave this for 1.3.2
[14:48:43] <gseguin> on 1.3-stable?
[14:48:55] <uGoMobi> gseguin: no, just working on it local
[14:48:57] <gseguin> ok so I'll regen the zip
[14:49:05] <gseguin> with the new Gruntfile
[14:49:25] <gseguin> and will upload it to CDN manually
[14:49:26] <uGoMobi> okay

[14:53:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: that's not fix for the search issue ^^
[14:54:15] <uGoMobi> some bigger changes are required to make that work
[14:54:25] <uGoMobi> so it has to wait until 1.3.2
[14:57:45] <toddmparker> ok, so let's ship it
[14:57:58] <toddmparker> any objections

[15:01:21] <uGoMobi> checking
[15:01:41] <gseguin> I probably need to update the demos on the CDN as well
