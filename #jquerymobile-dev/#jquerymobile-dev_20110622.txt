[06:21:15] <termleech> question on 1.0b1
[06:21:33] <termleech> when I view the site on my iPad 1 running IOS 4.3.3 in portrait mode
[06:21:42] <termleech> i have a listview that contains link and headers
[06:21:56] <termleech> but the listview and the page in general seems a lot smaller than 1.0a4.1
[06:22:03] <termleech> if i turn it to landscape it looks more like i expect
[06:22:13] <termleech> is there something i am doing wrong?
[07:48:32] <toddparker> good morning
[07:48:53] <toddparker> great response to the new radio/check gseguin
[07:49:18] <toddparker> we just need to get the alignment fixed on iPhone 4 and your Android 2.3 device and it's probably somethign we can just go with
[08:10:46] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[08:24:18] <gseguin> toddparker: oh there is alignment problem on iPhone 4 as well?
[08:24:23] <gseguin> darn
[08:24:53] <toddparker> yeah
[08:25:02] <toddparker> 1 px to the right, same as your 2.3 device, right?
[08:25:09] <toddparker> maybe my sprite is off
[08:25:18] <toddparker> just on radio, not check
[08:25:59] <gseguin> so the sprit is off, but that's not the only issue
[08:26:41] <kinblas> toddparker: 'ello
[08:26:57] <gseguin> Can we have UA class on the body? pretty please?
[08:27:12] * gseguin is doing the sad puppy dog face
[08:27:44] <toddparker> heh
[08:27:44] <gseguin> 'morning kinblas
[08:27:45] <toddparker> no
[08:27:55] <toddparker> hey kin
[08:28:00] <gseguin> :(
[08:31:10] <toddparker> gseguin, i have a theory
[08:31:18] <toddparker> what is the 2.3 android you have?
[08:31:37] <gseguin> toddparker: Google Phone
[08:31:44] <gseguin> I think it's the G2, not sure
[08:32:24] <toddparker> lemme find the specs
[08:32:31] <gseguin> ok
[08:32:39] <toddparker> nexus S?
[08:32:56] <toddparker> http://www.google.com/phone/detail/nexus-s-4g-from-google
[08:33:08] <gseguin> nexus one
[08:33:14] <gseguin> with 2.3.4 on it
[08:33:50] <toddparker> http://www.google.com/phone/detail/nexus-one
[08:33:57] <toddparker> so you upgraded it from 2.2
[08:34:07] <gseguin> not me, but yes
[08:34:07] <toddparker> Screen resolution	WVGA (800 x 480)
[08:34:22] <toddparker> so do you see the high res icons on that phone?
[08:34:50] * kinblas feels A4 deja-vu with touch events
[08:35:00] <toddparker> yeah
[08:35:02] <gseguin> hmm how would I check that?
[08:35:30] <toddparker> you could change the path in your local css for the high res icon to make it disappera
[08:35:35] <toddparker> looks for icon-32-white
[08:36:02] <toddparker> actually
[08:36:03] <toddparker> icons-36-white
[08:36:26] <gseguin> ok let me check what it's using
[08:36:31] <gseguin> I'll get back to you
[08:36:53] <toddparker> ok
[08:37:02] <toddparker> i just emailed an iphone 4 screenshot for comparison
[08:37:27] <toddparker> i think we could nudge the 36 icon position a bit
[08:45:36] <gseguin> toddparker: looking at weinre, what is pulling off of the server is the icon-18-white sprite
[09:12:42] <toddparker> hmm, that means that that phone is just getting the styles wrong
[09:13:00] <toddparker> I do still want to tweak the position of the high res icons
[09:13:07] <toddparker> separate issue
[09:13:28] <toddparker> is there a way to make these just align center somehow?
[09:22:22] <gseguin> I'll look
[09:56:21] <scottjehl> hi :)
[10:08:36] <gseguin> toddparker: I just received your email regarding the iphone 4
[10:08:47] <gseguin> damn anti-virus quarantined it
[10:09:07] <gseguin> yeah that's exactly the same offset as the Nexus One
[10:23:56] <toddparker> http://mac.github.com/
[10:24:05] <toddparker> interesting
[10:24:25] <toddparker> that's why i was asking about resolution
[10:24:40] <toddparker> hoping that the sprite was off for both
[10:24:58] <toddparker> but the android phone is using the 18px sprite, right?
[10:37:50] <gseguin> member:toddparker: right it's using the 18px sprite
[10:38:58] * gseguin notes that paste does not always paste what you copied
[10:40:57] <toddparker> heh
[10:42:14] <toddparker> let me ask scottjehl if he has any ideas
[10:42:47] <gseguin> sorry for the delayed replies, I have meetings this morning
[10:43:04] <toddparker> np
[12:08:42] <scottjehl> are you guys able to run the init suite? mine seems to stop around halfway
[12:08:47] <scottjehl> not fail, or die, just hangs
[12:45:59] <kinblas> scottjehl: ping
[12:46:15] <kinblas> was just wondering if you saw this:
[12:46:16] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1903
[12:46:22] <scottjehl> hey I had a q for you too :)
[12:46:43] <scottjehl> hmm. yeah that's not new, or a feature
[12:46:47] <kinblas> heh
[12:47:09] <kinblas> so that isn't due to the address bar hiding code?
[12:47:19] <kinblas> I noticed you added some things referring to screen.height
[12:47:24] <scottjehl> don't think so?
[12:48:09] <scottjehl> well, yeah setting the page's min height to availHeight on create, orientationchange, throttledresize
[12:48:12] <kinblas> anyways I was just wondering if the extra height he see's is equivalent to the height of the address bar
[12:48:25] <kinblas> ... and if that is due to screen.height
[12:48:53] <scottjehl> well, I can take a look. I'm using availHeight fwiw, and only if that's smaller than window height
[12:49:06] <scottjehl> (otherwise desktop gets really tall pages :) )
[12:49:44] <scottjehl> q for you. seems $.mobile.makeUrlAbsolute has a second arg that's not optional
[12:50:05] <scottjehl> yet makePathAbsolute's is optional
[12:50:24] <scottjehl> I guess path is just for making the path "/foo" right?
[12:50:36] <kinblas> right it's strictly for path, and not for url
[12:50:46] <kinblas> the other one definitely needs something to resolve against
[12:50:50] <scottjehl> but it'd be nice if the former prepended abs url if it wasn't provided
[12:50:54] <kinblas> because there are other things aside from the path that need resolving
[12:51:06] <kinblas> but what do we default to?
[12:51:10] <kinblas> base url or doc url?
[12:51:19] <scottjehl> in makeUrlAbsolute?
[12:51:23] <kinblas> yeah
[12:51:26] <scottjehl> we default to ERROR
[12:51:28] <scottjehl> hehe
[12:51:32] <kinblas> oh lol
[12:51:35] <scottjehl> it's required
[12:51:36] <kinblas> is there an isse?
[12:51:44] <scottjehl> but I was wondering if it needed to be
[12:51:54] <scottjehl> or if it even needed to be an argument
[12:52:08] <scottjehl> do we ever make absolute against an external url I guess?
[12:52:30] <kinblas> yeah we do
[12:52:35] <scottjehl> that aside, maybe defaulting to initial url would make sense?
[12:52:36] <kinblas> in the PhoneGap case
[12:52:38] <kinblas> it can be anything
[12:52:41] <scottjehl> right right
[12:52:46] <kinblas> since it can be file:// or some server
[12:53:04] <kinblas> so what's throwing an error?
[12:53:15] <kinblas> existing code? new code? user code?
[12:53:32] <scottjehl> just using it through the console
[12:53:36] <scottjehl> no errors in our codebase
[12:53:41] <kinblas> whew
[12:53:50] <kinblas> perhaps the thing to do is default to the documentBase
[12:54:01] <scottjehl> I noticed it because I was editing the view source bookmarklet to basically just open a new window as "viewsource:" absurl + path
[12:54:34] <scottjehl> I wanted to just say... $.mobile.path.makeUrlAbsolute( $.mobile.path.get() )
[12:54:39] <scottjehl> or something
[12:54:55] <scottjehl> but needed to define absUrl arg
[12:55:07] <scottjehl> seemed maybe not necessary to have no default
[12:55:27] <kinblas> heh double negative ... what?
[12:55:28] <kinblas> :-)
[12:56:02] <kinblas> seemed necessary to have a default?
[13:05:44] <scottjehl> YES :)
[13:37:14] <toddparker> hey eddiemonge
[13:37:24] <eddiemonge> hi
[13:37:29] <toddparker> do we provide a compressed version of valencia?
[13:37:36] <toddparker> or just the default theme
[13:38:32] <scottjehl> just default
[13:38:42] <scottjehl> packed with the rest of the css
[13:39:23] <gseguin> any plan to switch to LESS or similar?
[13:42:17] <scottjehl> not sure. In the past, we've tried to use a system that lets us keep test-ready css in the codebase
[13:42:35] <scottjehl> jquery ui uses comment tokens for variablized settings
[13:42:50] <scottjehl> which themeroller than find/reps
[13:43:08] <gseguin> we could have a pre-commit hook that expands the LESS file into it's CSS equivalent
[13:43:22] <gseguin> or something in the like
[13:43:25] <scottjehl> but the css is always static and usable. kinda nice, especially for people to get up and running without knowing more dependency langs
[13:45:32] <gseguin> both LESS and exploded CSS can live together in the repo
[13:47:13] <scottjehl> but commits would be made in LESS right?
[13:47:29] <scottjehl> and exploded css would be generated
[13:47:37] <gseguin> yes and no
[13:47:43] <gseguin> commit would be made in both
[13:48:37] <gseguin> the CSS would just be the exploded LESS
[13:48:55] <gseguin> I'm pretty sure we can automate that
[13:49:31] <eddiemonge> then what would be the point?
[13:49:50] <gseguin> write LESS css
[13:49:56] <gseguin> :P
[13:50:43] <eddiemonge> but if it gets expanded at build time, seems kind of pointless. i thought the point of less was to deliver less code
[13:51:19] <gseguin> not necessarily, it's mostly to write more maintainable code
[13:51:40] <gseguin> changing a color everywhere is just the matter of changing once
[13:51:58] <gseguin> instead of chasing it in all your different CSS files and replacing it
[13:52:15] <eddiemonge> well if you code your css correctly, it should only be in a few places
[13:52:21] <gseguin> but the browser doesn't understand LESS natively
[13:52:33] <gseguin> so shipping CSS to the browser still makes sense
[13:58:15] <scottjehl> not sure. Three main concerns: dependency on another codebase, requiring others learn that language to contribute CSS, and loss of fine-tuning CSS syntax
[14:01:13] <gseguin> scottjehl: wherever you need to fine tune you can still write pure CSS will not get processed
[14:09:17] <kinblas> scottjehl: ping
[14:12:54] <scottjehl> gseguin: I think it's worth considering. ThemeRoller will alleviate a lot of this for users at least
[14:12:59] <scottjehl> hey kin, what's up
[14:24:50] <scottjehl> kinblas?
[14:36:40] <kinblas> scottjehl: yo
[14:36:56] <scottjehl> hey what's up
[14:38:13] <kinblas> eh?
[14:38:16] <kinblas> you rang? :-)
[14:39:00] <scottjehl> "member:scottjehl: ping"
[14:39:11] <scottjehl> phone tag
[14:39:46] * gseguin notes that he's not the only one trusting copy too much ;)
[14:41:42] <scottjehl> heh.
[14:41:52] <scottjehl> good call
[14:42:06] <scottjehl> anyway, nothing here, Kin. Thought you were looking for me
[14:42:25] <scottjehl> view page source in jQM:
[14:42:27] <scottjehl> javascript:( function (l,h){ h = l.hash.replace( /^#/,''), window.open( 'view-source:' + ( h ? l.href.split( l.pathname )[0] + h : l.href ) ); }( location ))
[14:57:26] <toddparker> hey kinblas  - thens for testing that test page around agian
[14:57:50] <toddparker> so how should we proceed on fixing up android 2.1?
[14:58:13] <toddparker> with the vclick bugginess
[14:58:21] <toddparker> what a crappy platform
[15:11:59] <kinblas> toddparker: so all these bugs that are resurfacing have to do with our hijaxing callback being processed on the vclick (touchend)
[15:12:28] <kinblas> the reason we backed down in a4.1 was for 2 reasons
[15:13:07] <kinblas> 1. the different devices calculate the target for the touch and mouse differently.
[15:13:44] * kinblas lost his train of thought ... grrr
[15:14:34] <kinblas> 2. Users and code written on the desktop used mouse/click events so we needed to allow them to happen
[15:15:41] <kinblas> The way we got around the android 2.1 problem was to simply do stuff on the click event
[15:16:33] <kinblas> that way the vclick (touchend) happens on the element the user actually touched, but when the Android 2.1 browser goes and fires the click on the link 200px away from where you touched, it actually navigates
[15:17:12] <kinblas> Note that issue 1904 is actually a problem in *ALL* webkit browsers that support touch
[16:03:45] <gseguin> toddparker: you were right
[16:04:08] <gseguin> toddparker:  the icons-36-white is off
[16:31:56] <gseguin> toddparker: ping
