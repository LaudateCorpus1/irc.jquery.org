[01:16:28] <agcolom> stopping for now... I have a conflict with the above in 1.1-stable
[01:25:11] <agcolom> OMG!!! I have managed to resolved the conflict!!!! Still I have to investigate what the problem was and need to remember that the last commit in docs/pages/page-anatomy.html is not in 1.1-stable...
[01:25:30] <agcolom> but will get breakfast 1st!
[01:31:21] <agcolom> gseguin, toddparker, johnbender, _|Nix|_ : it seems to me that none of the new commits in the jquery-mobile/docs/pages folder can be cherry-picked as that contains the menu item for popups and loading widgets which are not in 1.1-stable
[01:32:26] <agcolom> so it is ok to continue to merge PRs for that folder in master and the remaining changes will go into 1.2 or is it time for me to learn to resolve conflicts?
[01:37:59] <uGoMobi> agcolom: goodmorning Anne
[01:39:10] <agcolom> Good morning :-)
[01:41:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: maybe it as an idea to change the way the navmenu is included in the docs
[01:42:25] <uGoMobi> now it is hardcoded on every page, maybe we can do it with Ajax
[01:42:45] <uGoMobi> or do the docs need to be pure html only?
[01:44:48] <agcolom> Yes, I think that'd be nice, but we need to ensure that it works also on small screens such as iPhone/iPod Touch and all small phones
[01:46:28] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, i understand. I don't mean changing the structure/layout.
[01:47:29] <uGoMobi> I was thinking about having one sitemap wich is the source for all the navmenu and then use Ajax to pull in the right navmenu for each page of the doc
[01:48:43] <uGoMobi> so you just change that sitemap for a bugs fix release to leave out new features that are already in master but should not be in release
[01:48:45] <agcolom> Sounds good. Todd mentioned something for future that he thought could be used there. I can't remember what it was called. Might be a good idea to talk about this at our next meeting?
[01:49:00] <uGoMobi> yes sure
[01:49:17] <uGoMobi> would be easier for the search index nav.html too
[01:49:33] <uGoMobi> right now it easy to forget to add new pages there
[01:49:41] <agcolom> oh yes :-)
[01:50:05] <agcolom> How big a change would that be (in terms of implementation)
[01:53:01] <uGoMobi> the content of the secondary-content div has to be removed from all pages
[01:54:32] <uGoMobi> and it will take some time figure out good JS to handle it, because the navmenu is not same on each page
[01:55:26] <uGoMobi> but i think it's worth to invest some time in it
[01:56:15] <agcolom> yes. Let's mention it and add it to the agenda. Also Scott will be back I think so he may have some ideas on that also.
[01:57:46] <uGoMobi> yes, lets discuss in meeting and ideas from the others about this. do you have link to the agenda or want me to paste it here?
[01:58:22] <uGoMobi> i meant ...and hear ideas from others ...
[01:59:10] <agcolom> yes please (link to agenda)

[01:59:43] <agcolom> thank you :-)
[02:00:12] <agcolom> Have to go now... have a good weekend,
[02:00:25] <uGoMobi> youre welcome. thank you. you too! :)
[02:40:29] <MauriceG> Hi all!
[02:52:22] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[03:07:26] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi!  I was just kicked out ...
[03:07:45] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ai ai
[03:08:46] <MauriceG> I must test around a little with this java applet ...
[03:11:29] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Is there another way to use this chat or just with an applet?
[03:12:04] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: you can use any IRC client
[03:12:45] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: I'm not familiar with that ...
[03:12:54] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: just see which you like most for your OS
[03:13:19] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I didn't use IRC before either
[03:15:52] <MauriceG> I'm on the way to look for an IRC client. I've found mIRC (I'm on windows now)
[03:16:42] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I think that's the most popular one
[03:17:45] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: Todd mentioned a new client (don't remember the name right now) but you need link to download it because it is test version
[03:18:32] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: http://www.ircreviews.org/clients/platforms-windows.html
[03:19:08] <MauriceG> Thank you!
[03:22:34] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: sorry, that was not the link to download that new client... here you can request that link: irccloud.com
[03:23:49] <uGoMobi> and it's not a client actually, but for browser
[03:28:37] <MauriceG> Thanks again! It seems, they have a waiting list. But it's great for iPad too.
