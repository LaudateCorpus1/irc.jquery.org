[00:56:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[01:01:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Interesting: 1. Open popup/index.html in portrait mode. 2. Open the map. 3. Close the map. 4. Switch to landscape. 5. Open the map. 6. Close the map. 7. Switch to portrait. 8. Open the map.
[01:02:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: At this point, the map overflows the edge of the screen, even though you have sized it correctly. If you close the map like this, the page will be messed up. You can fix the page by changing the orientation to landscape and then back to portrait.
[01:03:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Even better: If, at this point, you start dragging the map, it suddenly changes to the size you told it to be, and if you dismiss the page after you've dragged it, it's not broken.
[01:44:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9G1a-hmnKI4
[02:07:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: interesting
[02:19:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Weird, eh?
[02:19:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: very
[02:19:55] <uGoMobi> I was thinking about trying things with updatelayout maybe
[02:20:23] <_|Nix|_> Or $("iframe").click() :)
[02:20:41] <_|Nix|_> ... although click() wouldn't do it, because I tried clicking on it and it didn't magically change size.
[02:20:54] <_|Nix|_> Only when I started dragging the map did it magically change size.
[02:22:20] <uGoMobi> so we have to think of something that triggers the redraw
[02:22:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You gotta ask yourself though, whether it's worth fixing this further. I mean, fundamentally, it works, and the breakage is not really our fault. It may not be worth the energy to work around the bug much longer.
[02:23:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and besides, if you do find the perfect workaroudn, great - it works! ... for this example.
[02:23:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah you are right, we have to draw a line somewhere... enough other issues to solve
[02:23:43] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[02:23:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Are you then going to write extensive documentation about hooking to popupbeforeopen and popupafterclose and all that just to make it work for everybody who's willing to spend the time to read the docs?
[02:24:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess we can run it by toddparker and see what he thinks.
[02:24:36] <uGoMobi> exactly... if it is something we can't include in the framework anyway... how useful is it... just for the docs demos
[02:24:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and it's not like we can build a generic workaround for all iframes, because the popup can contain anything - not just an iframe.
[02:25:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, that's what I mean... it won't be a general solution anyway, but always something requires custom code
[02:25:54] <_|Nix|_> Unfortunately ... blame Android *shrug*
[02:26:44] <_|Nix|_> I guess a lot of people might not even notice the bug. I mean, it works just fine as long as you don't open the map in landscape and then again in portrait.
[02:27:34] <_|Nix|_> ... and even if you do, and you see the wrongly sized map, it only breaks if you then dismiss. If you start using the map, it magically resizes and does not break the page. So, in a real life usage scenario, you'll probably be fine.
[02:28:20] <_|Nix|_> But, of course, this assumes that you have written the custom code for sizing an iframe to 0x0 and then back to some normal size.
[02:28:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually the function I wrote for the iframes doesn't check if height of the iframe is bigger than screen height
[02:28:46] <uGoMobi> cos I thought... if so, then scroll
[02:29:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I noticed that. That's why in landscape, the map is taller than the screen.
[02:29:06] <uGoMobi> I can implement that, so it checks width and height
[02:29:17] <uGoMobi> yup
[02:29:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, sure ... if you feel like it.
[02:29:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah that's simple
[02:29:55] <uGoMobi> so I am going to do that and then I leave it (for now at least)
[02:30:38] <uGoMobi> we can ask toddparker at today's meeting
[02:31:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: will let you know when I have committed the change
[02:37:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Don't worry - jqmobilecommit will let me know :)
[02:38:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've commented on the issue. If people report this, we can mark it as a dupe, and point them to our solution: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4695#issuecomment-7093803
[02:38:41] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4695 on jquery-mobile (gabrielschulhof; 5d, 12h ago): popup: large popup positioned wrong on Android 2.3.5
[02:39:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good one
[02:40:55] <_|Nix|_> You know ... I have a crazy thought ... what if, instead of setting width/height to 0, we remove the iframe from the DOM. Then, we put it back inside popupbeforeopen ...
[02:40:58] <_|Nix|_> ?
[02:42:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm ... might be even a better approach
[02:43:03] <uGoMobi> but we still have to set width/height props
[02:44:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, but only if you want to resize the iframes.
[02:44:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You no longer need to set width/height because it has previously been set to 0.
[02:44:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, you'd be doing the natural thing.
[02:44:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but you have to otherwise it breaks Android anyway when you attach it to the DOM again
[02:45:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, right. If you leave things untouched, the page is fundamentally broken, right?
[02:45:42] <uGoMobi> yes
[02:46:15] <_|Nix|_> Nono, wait a minute. When the popup is not open, the iframes are not in the DOM. So, the page should be fine.
[02:46:39] <_|Nix|_> Then, when the popup is open, the iframes are in the DOM, with non-zero width and height, and the page should be fine.
[02:46:56] <_|Nix|_> Then, when the popup is closed, the iframes are not in the DOM, so the page should be fine.
[02:47:05] <_|Nix|_> Is any of this incorrect?
[02:47:26] <_|Nix|_> So, we can remove iframes from the DOM when we enhance the popup.
[02:47:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you say non-zero width and height
[02:47:43] <_|Nix|_> ... and put them back in the DOM before we trigger "popupbeforeopen"
[02:47:54] <uGoMobi> so when and how do we set those?
[02:48:12] <uGoMobi> with the function we currently use for the docs
[02:48:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's assume the iframe width and height specified in the original markup are OK, and can be used.
[02:48:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If we do the above, the page will not be broken.
[02:49:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If, in addition to that, you wish to scale things, well, that's up to you Mr. Random J. Developer
[02:49:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, but the problem is the part you assumed to be OK
[02:49:25] <uGoMobi> lol
[02:49:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course, let's test all this.
[02:49:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I think we need to do the placeholder dance with all the iframes.
[02:50:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I finish that function that controls the max-height
[02:50:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean: When enhancing, replace each iframe with an empty div. Then, before triggering popupbeforeopen, replace each div with the corresponding iframe.
[02:50:36] <uGoMobi> we can test with both
[02:51:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes I understand, same as you do for the popup div itself
[02:51:17] <_|Nix|_> Yes, actually.
[02:51:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This is an enormous hack though, and should probably not go into popup. Maybe we should make another script that depends on popup, so, if people want this hack, they can add it to their page.
[02:51:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think that the meta viewport tag isn't taken into account when you load an iframe on Android 2.3
[02:52:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, so maybe we should leave it for later and focus on some other things that need to be done for 1.2a first
[02:53:03] <_|Nix|_> I think so too.
[02:53:17] <_|Nix|_> Meanwhile, we can point people to that comment.
[02:53:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what about recalculating position on throttledresize / change orientation?
[02:53:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, I agree
[02:54:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when you open a popup with landscape image in it you often switch your phone from portrait to landscape orientation
[02:55:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so it would be really nice if the position is recalculated on this event
[02:59:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know. That's a whole new world. I can reposition the popup, but I cannot resize it.
[02:59:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just reposition
[02:59:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's a big todo item for me.
[02:59:50] <uGoMobi> resizing will be done by CSS or your custom function
[02:59:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Should probably make an issue.
[02:59:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I understand
[03:00:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but do you agree it's a very useful feature?
[03:00:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No it won't, because I don't trigger popupbeforeopen again ... I don't think ...
[03:00:19] <uGoMobi> worth to spend time on
[03:00:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, 100%.
[03:00:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but maybe we should rename popupbeforeopen to, like, popuprealize or something.
[03:00:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then, I can trigger it upon resize.
[03:01:21] <uGoMobi> oh oh another new even ;)
[03:01:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We need to find a better name for "imabouttodisplaythispopupsomovesizeshowhidewhatevertomakeitlookgood"
[03:01:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not a new event. We rename "popupbeforeopen".
[03:02:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah right, I missed that

[04:12:27] <_|Nix|_> Oh, OK ...
[04:12:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not master, that one takes about 17 minutes
[04:12:40] <_|Nix|_> ... but those probably don't run unit tests, eh?
[04:12:48] <uGoMobi> indeed
[04:13:07] <uGoMobi> but still strange... they use to take about 1.5 minute
[04:13:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm .. I got a bunch of commits lined up, but I want to push them one at a time to make sure I don't break the build ... gonna take a while, probably.
[04:13:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I ran the unit tests on each one locally, but you never know ...
[04:14:15] <_|Nix|_> ... and running phantomjs locally probably still doesn't work.
[04:14:22] <uGoMobi> BTW - I think I made a mistake in the logic of that iframe size function I just pushed

[09:26:21] <johnbender> there is no jqm datepicker
[09:26:22] <rworth> is that supported?
[09:26:25] <rworth> ok, cool
[09:26:26] <gnarf> it should be a pretty straightforward task
[09:26:26] <johnbender> no
[09:26:30] <rworth> found an issue, filing it now
[09:26:35] <johnbender> rworth: kk
[09:26:48] <johnbender> gnarf: want to do it tomorrow morning?
[09:27:09] <johnbender> gnarf: I can be online to make sure all is well for a couple of hours
[09:27:16] <gnarf> johnbender: im usually not a mornings guy, but I'll try to be here early :)
[09:27:23] <johnbender> gnarf: hah
[09:27:25] <johnbender> gnarf: kk
[09:27:33] <gnarf> johnbender: also, ill probably do a "pre-move" later today and send you the new IP
[09:27:36] <johnbender> gnarf: anytime before 11 should be fine
[09:27:40] <johnbender> gnarf: kk
[09:27:45] <gnarf> 11 eastern?
[09:27:52] <johnbender> gnarf: pst
[09:28:07] <gnarf> thats currently 9:27 then right?
[09:28:12] <johnbender> sorry, should be obvious to me by now that everyone in the jq universe is east coast
[09:28:15] <johnbender> gnarf: yah
[09:28:19] <gnarf> johnbender: im central
[09:28:38] <gnarf> johnbender: but i guess est when people say times cuz it seems "boston time" is our measure :)
[09:28:45] <johnbender> gnarf: yep :D
[09:29:02] <gnarf> johnbender: i should be up and moving before 11 then :)
[09:29:15] <gnarf> johnbender: luckily your morning is my almost noon
[09:29:17] <gnarf> so it works out
[09:30:12] <johnbender> perfect

[09:30:34] <johnbender> so just ping me
[09:31:00] <gnarf> roger - check for an issue in infrastructure too if i'm not up yet
[09:31:07] <gnarf> there is prolly gonna be instructions for you to test :)

[10:14:30] <Wilto> I hardly know what “HTML” stands for, let alone putting it all up in some maths.
[10:14:35] <Wilto> This is awesome.
[10:15:21] <johnbender> Wilto: I think the backward compatible api addition is the cool part
[10:15:28] <johnbender> there are a lot of good reasons to do this imo

[10:21:00] <johnbender> Wilto: thanks guy
[10:28:09] <toddparker> smaller = good
[10:28:48] <toddparker> hey johnbender - i know you're busy but i'd like your input on how to implement the position-to option for popup
[10:28:54] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: you around?
[10:29:00] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: What's up?
[10:29:25] <toddparker> johnbender is here, wanted to have you chat with him on that position option
[10:29:31] <toddparker> can you summarize for johnbender
[10:30:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: $( "#popupBasic" ).popup( "open", 0, 0, $( {} ).jqmData( "position-to", "window"  ).jqmData( "transition", "slide" ) );
[10:30:45] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's how you pass position-to to popup's open()
[10:31:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The decision: Shall we add a positionTo option to popup just like we added the transition option, in order to avoid code like that?
[10:31:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm not saying it's bad code ...
[10:32:36] <toddparker> johnbender: we realized that, just like transition, the position-to option needs to be something you can set programmatically when you open a popup
[10:32:49] <toddparker> so how to do this best?
[10:33:41] <johnbender> toddparker: _|Nix|_: hrm, I guess I would expect an options object in the call to open
[10:33:45] <johnbender> not sure if that works though
[10:34:17] <johnbender> $( "#popupBasic" ).popup( "open", { left: 0, top: 0, position: "window" })
[10:34:21] <johnbender> something like that
[10:34:39] <johnbender> $( "#popupBasic" ).popup( "open", { left: 0, top: 0, position: "window", transition: "slide" })
[10:35:05] <johnbender> position-to is kind of confusing too
[10:35:06] <johnbender> hmm
[10:35:16] <johnbender> offset-from ?
[10:35:19] <johnbender> offset location?
[10:35:20] <johnbender> not sure
[10:35:26] <johnbender> does any of that make sense?
[10:35:26] <_|Nix|_> We gotta ask ourselves: If we have a lot of just-this-once overrides for popup's options, then what's the point of having options at all?
[10:35:58] <_|Nix|_> People will just put the options into the <a> instead of the <div data-role="popup">
[10:37:36] <_|Nix|_> Popup already has two of its options duplicated between the <a> and the popup <div>: transition and position-to ...
[10:37:54] <_|Nix|_> OK ... position-to is not yet duplicated, but if I add it as a popup option, it will be.,
[10:43:24] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: position-to is called that because there may end up being a second option, "position", with values like "center,top", "right,middle", etc.
[10:44:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If you don't necessarily want to /center/ over the element identified by position-to.
[10:44:35] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right, positioning on an element
[10:45:16] <toddparker> forgot we have our meeting in 15
[10:46:03] <toddparker> i'll get an agenda together
[10:46:16] <toddparker> johnbender: i'd expect that too
[10:46:40] <Wilto> If I fixed something do I get to attend the meeting this week? Y/N_
[10:46:48] <toddparker> yes
[10:46:52] <_|Nix|_> toddparker, johnbender: OK, so change the method to .open( { /* options go here */ } )?
[10:47:40] <_|Nix|_> toddparker, johnbender: We can still go with .open( x, y, transition, positionTo ) 4 params does not yet break the turn-into-an-option-object threshold, right?

[10:53:10] <gseguin> don't know what happened

[10:53:38] <toddparker> it's really broken?
[10:53:50] <toddparker> gseguin: see that the site is being moved today/tomorrow
[10:53:59] <toddparker> worth having you looking at that too
[10:54:14] <uGoMobi> johnbender: seems like a very great post ... going to read it in the morning with cup of coffee and full attention
[10:54:27] <gseguin> toddparker: I did ask gnarf to make sure to port the ProxyPass rule
[10:54:40] <uGoMobi> because otherwise I probably get lost pretty soon
[10:54:46] <gseguin> that's all that's needed to ensure that it can still hit the backend
[10:54:56] <gnarf> i haven't done anything with mobile yet :)
[10:55:36] <gseguin> gnarf: after you move jquerymobile.com
[10:56:08] <gseguin> make sure that http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/ is still working
[10:56:17] <gseguin> if that's not the case ping me
[10:57:37] <gnarf> will do :)
[10:57:42] <gnarf> prolly tomorrow morning
[10:57:42] <gnarf> also
[10:57:56] <gnarf> will have it up tonight if you want to edit your hosts file

[10:58:09] <gseguin> I am
[10:58:14] <gnarf> I'll CC you on the issue
[10:58:20] <gseguin> sounds good
[11:02:07] <toddparker>  meeting timez
[11:04:28] <Wilto> Should I join as well?
[11:05:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The map is off-center in Chrome. It's like the left edge is in the middle of the window.
[11:06:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: :(
[11:06:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not when I tested.... will check after meeting
[11:06:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The video works fine.
[11:08:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just tested Chrome again with clear catch... popup is centered
[11:09:04] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I'll try that.
[11:59:51] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, about that semantic issue: The meaning of the word "origin" for positionTo. It's easy to say that it means whatever got clicked, and that works, too, if you stick to markup, because popup does the click handling, and so it knows what it is you clicked on and is therefore able to discern the origin.
[12:00:24] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: However, consider the following invocation of open: .popup( "open", undefined, undefined, "slide", "origin" );
[12:00:38] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Where the two undefined values are x and y.
[12:01:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: In this case, I cannot know what the origin was, because the user didn't click on anything. Instead, the dev invoked open by hand.
[12:01:25] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... rather than the click handler invoking it.
[12:02:11] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, we need to document that "origin" doesn't really mean "wrt. whatever you clicked on", but instead it means "use the x and y coordinates passed in, and don't worry about making it relative to anything".
[12:02:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We need to say this, because we also have logic that says that if either x or y is not defined, it will be set to the middle of the window.
[12:03:15] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, the effect of the above function call is actually to place the popup in the middle of the window, as if you had passed "window", and not "origin".
[12:07:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: .popup( "open", [ x,y | window ] , "slide", "origin" ); ?
[12:08:13] <uGoMobi> oops... .popup( "open", [ x,y | window ] , "slide");
[12:08:50] <toddparker> johnbender: we have offsets too
[12:08:53] <toddparker> related: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4726
[12:08:53] <uGoMobi> so you can only use origin on the data-attribute
[12:08:54] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4726 on jquery-mobile (samdoost; 23m, 38s ago): popup: Allow pupup to fit in a rectangle that fully reaches window edges
[12:09:09] <toddparker> another potential option for an instance
[12:09:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'd rather avoid doing the variable-number-of-arguments thing. Too much argument massaging at the top of the function that way.
[12:09:14] <toddparker> which i can see
[12:09:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[12:09:43] <toddparker> but ATM tolerances aren't exposed at all, are they?
[12:09:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Go with undefined for x and/or y if you don't want to specify them.
[12:10:13] <_|Nix|_> But OK - Ima retire for today. L8R all!
[12:10:18] <uGoMobi> which brings us back to where we were because that is the same is window
[12:10:27] <uGoMobi> ok, no good solution
[12:10:41] <uGoMobi> good evening _|Nix|_
[12:11:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The solution is to point this out in the docs. Think about it: if I tell you to position yourself wrt. the origin, but I do not tell you the coords of the origin, then what coords will you use to position yourself?
[12:11:55] <uGoMobi> right
[12:12:28] <uGoMobi> it makes sense, but I was just thinking about how we can make this as simple as possible for the user

[14:03:43] <uGoMobi> popupbeforeclose
[14:04:38] <uGoMobi> so you can do preventDefault
[14:36:15] <toddparker> yeah, that might be a good way to handle it
[14:36:30] <toddparker> the back button is still going to work
[14:36:54] <toddparker> but that would allow them to make that happen without adding more options

[14:37:13] <toddparker> HA
[15:00:44] <agcolom> toddparker: regarding the examples in the api docs, currently everything in inside a div data-role="page"
[15:01:47] <agcolom> I am wondering whether the widget example should actually have the widget also inside a "content" container.
[15:02:13] <toddparker> to give it more padding?
[15:02:23] <agcolom> no just for the code
[15:02:33] <agcolom> the code example
[15:02:41] <toddparker> the page should be there or the framework will wrap it for you
[15:02:46] <agcolom> is your computer setup?
[15:02:55] <toddparker> to preview?
[15:03:02] <agcolom> yes
[15:03:04] <agcolom> http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/checkbox/
[15:03:08] <agcolom> can you see that?
[15:03:40] <agcolom> the example code is at the bottom of the page

[15:05:43] <toddparker> i need to update my hosts
[15:06:10] <agcolom> ok.
[15:06:43] <agcolom> or I can email you a picture if that's easier
[15:06:50] <toddparker> ok, i'm in!
[15:06:55] <agcolom> ok
[15:07:19] <agcolom> so the way this works, is that all the examples use the same template.
[15:07:41] <toddparker> gotcha
[15:07:47] <toddparker> new font
[15:07:59] <agcolom> yes, no me :-)
[15:08:04] <toddparker> proxima nova. nice.
[15:08:04] <agcolom> not me!
[15:08:11] <toddparker> one of my favs
[15:08:31] <agcolom> the highlighting will get sorted out soon
[15:08:52] <toddparker> cool
[15:09:02] <toddparker> ok, so your question...
[15:09:37] <agcolom> everything up to the div data-role="page" is part of the common template
[15:09:55] <agcolom> the only thing that changes is the inner part of that.
[15:10:14] <toddparker> now do you mean the example at the bottom?
[15:10:24] <agcolom> yes
[15:10:27] <toddparker> ok
[15:10:40] <agcolom> now, I am not sure whether I should change that to also have a header, content and footer
[15:10:52] <toddparker> so I'd add the content div for sure
[15:11:06] <toddparker> the header is a maybe
[15:11:08] <agcolom> yes, I was thinking that'd be better.
[15:11:18] <toddparker> w/o content it'll look ugly
[15:11:34] <agcolom> yes, it goes right up to the edge...
[15:11:35] <toddparker> so that is the template you're talking about?
[15:11:39] <agcolom> yes
[15:11:42] <toddparker> right. content adds 15px padding
[15:12:17] <agcolom> yes, so people would tend to copy and paste the example I would imagine, so we must use good practice
[15:12:26] <toddparker> right
[15:12:33] <agcolom> so I agree with you to add content div.
[15:12:43] <agcolom> what about header and footer?
[15:12:56] <toddparker> if you copy this, the page won't work because it refs local query and such
[15:13:01] <toddparker> but maybe that's the standard?
[15:13:10] <gseguin> uGoMobi: cool, thank you for taking care of that
[15:13:14] <toddparker> if we linked up CDN versions, it would actually work
[15:13:21] <gseguin> toddparker: last time I checked it was up
[15:13:36] <agcolom> oh yes, so that'll need changing too.
[15:13:39] <toddparker> worksforme
[15:13:43] <toddparker> ok, cool
[15:13:47] <gseguin> when the error was reported I just bounced the sesrver
[15:14:07] <toddparker> that way, you can copy paste and it will work like a charm. instant gratification
[15:14:07] <gseguin> and then everything was working again
[15:14:15] <gseguin> no idea what happened
[15:14:19] <toddparker> ah, i see gseguin
[15:14:35] <agcolom> toddparker: yes I just reused what was there for jqueryui for the links, so I'll update to the correct CDN versions
[15:14:47] <toddparker> nice
[15:14:59] <agcolom> so header and footer? yes/no?
[15:15:00] <toddparker> and there will be versions for each release so we can keep it all in sync
[15:15:06] <toddparker> no footer IMHO
[15:15:16] <agcolom> ok, header?
[15:15:27] <danheberden> midder?
[15:15:29] <toddparker> just figure the header might help orient people to the structure

[15:26:00] <agcolom> anyone would recommend some good resources to learn grunt and node.js ?
[15:26:26] <danheberden> garann's node.js book is short and sweet
[15:26:30] <danheberden> easy to get into
