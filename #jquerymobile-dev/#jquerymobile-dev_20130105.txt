[06:29:58] <uGoMobi> I found the problem that is causing the timeout in the panel test
[06:31:16] <uGoMobi> phantomjs is passing the $.support.cssTransitions test
[06:38:21] <uGoMobi> but it looks like the webkitTransitionEnd is never fired, so the "panelopen" event isn't fired either
[07:03:07] <uGoMobi> ok the problem is in panel JS.... for open() we check $.support.cssTransitions and for close() we check $.support.cssTransform3d
[07:03:42] <uGoMobi> changing open() to use $.support.cssTransform3d as well fixes the whole problem
[07:04:44] <uGoMobi> double checking if that is the correct support test to use

[07:27:04] <uGoMobi> useful to know: PhantomJS supports CSS transforms transitions animations but not transforms3d...http://code.google.com/p/phantomjs/wiki/SupportedFeatures
[07:28:45] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[08:18:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Good to know about transitions
[08:26:50] <uGoMobi> hi arschmitz 
[08:28:34] <uGoMobi> I am looking at FF issue with overflow-x hidden on the page now
[08:28:53] <uGoMobi> it kills the transition
[08:31:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Cools
[10:32:11] <uGoMobi> update: FF is a timing issue... if you put an alert after self._page.addClass( o.classes.pageBlock ); which adds the class we set overflow-x hidden for (to force a pause) everything works fine
[10:34:46] <uGoMobi> was wondering what would be the downside by setting it for class ui-page-panel-animate which is already added to the page when it gets enhanced
[10:35:07] <uGoMobi> have to see if that can break page transitions
[10:36:08] <uGoMobi> to be continued on monday
[13:22:51] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15shamank opened issue #5421: data-corners=false is being applied always in a ul element inside a collapsible  02http://git.io/IbMgGg
[20:45:18] <toddmparker_> hmmm...just tested the panels in Android 4.0 and 4.1 on /test/ and they seem really broken. They are fine on 2.3 and iOS but these were working ok on 4.x at some point. Anyone with a 4.0 or 4.1 handy to confirm? I'm on browserstack.
[20:46:40] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: interesting idea, let's do some testing
[21:03:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: ill take a look right now see what i can find
[21:23:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: it seems some how the native browser is now showing the same behivor as the webview setting data-position-fixed="false" makes them work properly
