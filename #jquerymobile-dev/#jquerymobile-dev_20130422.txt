[07:16:02] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_
[07:16:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was working on buttons without buttonMarkup
[07:16:41] <uGoMobi> but didn't fully understand splitOptions
[07:17:05] <uGoMobi> and _setOption(s)
[07:17:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh. It splits buttonMarkup-related options from non-buttonMarkup related options.
[07:17:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So only those options get passed to buttonMarkup that buttonMarkup understands.
[07:17:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah I see
[07:17:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, disabled doesn't get passed to buttonMarkup.
[07:18:07] <uGoMobi> so I can remove that
[07:18:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For sure.
[07:18:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess "disabled" is the only option that we need to handle after all that.
[07:18:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[07:20:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: going to make some more changes and maybe you can take a look at the code when I am done

[07:30:38] <toddmparker> morning
[07:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: Are you good at hand-writing SVG?
[07:31:33] <toddmparker> no, wilto is
[07:31:42] <scott_gonzalez> WILTO!!!!!!!
[07:31:51] <toddmparker> i usually export from illustrator, then crack it open and delete cruft
[07:32:00] <toddmparker> he claims he can hand write it
[07:33:02] <scott_gonzalez> I've got this: http://jsbin.com/ilazuc/1/edit
[07:33:17] <scott_gonzalez> And I'm wondering how I can run a filter against the color.
[07:33:27] <scott_gonzalez> For example, if I want to make it slightly darker.
[07:33:35] <scott_gonzalez> But still use currentColor.
[07:33:48] <scott_gonzalez> I know nothing about SVG.
[07:37:55] <scott_gonzalez> For example, if I was trying to create http://cl.ly/image/1N2s3M2n0n0X just from the ligher blue color.
[07:40:27] <scott_gonzalez>  hmm...maybe this isn't an issue.
[07:40:36] <scott_gonzalez> Icon fonts only have a single color.
[07:44:56] <toddmparker> sorry, got trapped in a congo. looking
[07:45:26] <toddmparker> http://www.schepers.cc/w3c/svg/params/ref.html
[07:45:34] <toddmparker> you can pass color params in
[07:45:43] <toddmparker> trapped in a congo. oh well.
[07:45:58] <toddmparker> convo. convo. conversation.
[07:46:13] <toddmparker> hate auto-correct except when it always saves my butt
[07:46:30] <scott_gonzalez> heh
[07:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, I'm going to have something to show you in a bit.
[07:47:11] <toddmparker> coo
[07:47:14] <toddmparker> l
[07:47:23] <scott_gonzalez> But, it might not be actually usable for a while.
[07:47:23] <toddmparker> *facepalm*
[07:47:25] <scott_gonzalez> We'll see...
[07:48:22] <toddmparker> the one thing is that svg needs a fallback so with grunt icon, we use grunt to generate png images versions. all the cool svg manip stuff is client side
[08:07:20] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: http://temp.nemikor.com/icon-test/
[08:07:38] <scott_gonzalez> WARNING: WebKit-only, and I have no idea what I'm doing.
[08:07:44] <toddmparker> heh
[08:07:59] <scott_gonzalez> view source and look at lines 40-41
[08:08:24] <scott_gonzalez> At some point, we'll be able to just write that.
[08:08:40] <toddmparker> that will be a bright, shiny future. nice.
[08:09:01] <scott_gonzalez> So the question is: Can all of this be polyfilled today?
[08:09:08] <toddmparker> right now, our options are uglier
[08:09:53] <scott_gonzalez> By using SVG + currentColor, we should get all benefits of fonts.
[08:09:56] <toddmparker> since SVG isn't supported in a some key browsers, we need to generate fallback bitmaps so that is the hardest thing to polyfill in the traditional sense
[08:10:04] <toddmparker> yeah, that is badass
[08:10:06] <scott_gonzalez> But without the problems associated with characters.
[08:10:14] <toddmparker> unless we could fallback to canvas?
[08:10:30] <scott_gonzalez> We can fallback to canvas, but the tricky part then is knowing when to redraw.
[08:10:43] <scott_gonzalez> e.g., if color changes on hover
[08:10:54] <toddmparker> right
[08:11:09] <scott_gonzalez> I tried to use an Object.observe polyfill on a getComputedStyle result, but that didn't work.
[08:11:20] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure if a native Object.observe would work there.
[08:11:22] <toddmparker> for svg, android 2.x and i.e. 5-8 don't support it
[08:11:53] <toddmparker> android 2.x supports canvas, but i.e. is still left out
[08:12:22] <scott_gonzalez> IE gets canvas support via excanvas.
[08:12:36] <scott_gonzalez> Of course file size continues to grow by adding all these fallbacks.
[08:12:45] <toddmparker> right
[08:13:10] <toddmparker> that is the pickle
[08:13:23] <scott_gonzalez> But custom element + SVG = potentially promising, as least based on this initial test.
[08:13:24] <toddmparker> that's why we went with pngs
[08:13:36] <toddmparker> but that precludes us from using all the dynamic stuff in svgs
[08:14:17] <toddmparker> be worth hacking on this more. coming up with a responsible way to handle vector images in an accessible, crow-browser way is still not easy
[08:14:50] <toddmparker> so currentColor is the inherited CSS text color, right?
[08:14:55] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[08:15:08] <scott_gonzalez> You should've seen my first implementation, before I discovered currentColor :-)
[08:15:29] <scott_gonzalez> http://jsbin.com/ajomiy/2/edit
[08:16:29] <toddmparker> i'm digging this idea
[08:17:00] <toddmparker> the thing i hate with our svgs now is making a different graphic for color variaitons
[08:17:56] <scott_gonzalez> Can you put together a quick list of pros/cons of the various things you've looked at?
[08:18:15] <scott_gonzalez> Or features you wish you had, but can't implement right now?
[08:20:14] <toddmparker> for svg or vector icons in general?
[08:22:03] <scott_gonzalez> Icons in general.
[08:52:19] <toddmparker> ah, ok

[12:23:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah thats a review item on the list though not a 100% must one so should be there for 1.4 but maybe not on *EVERY* widget lol
[12:38:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That data is there to avoid re-creating the ui-btn-inner and ui-btn-text divs.
[12:38:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not useful otherwise.
[12:39:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, thanks
[12:39:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in the button widget it's only needed to store classes so I just store it on the native element
[12:40:41] <_|Nix|_> Yep!
[12:41:50] <uGoMobi> now I think of it... I should remove the data in _destroy
[12:42:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is there a reason you are not storing it as part of the widget and are storing it on the element?
[12:43:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no, not really I think
[12:43:32] <arschmitz> then you should probably just store it on the widget and it gets cleaned up automaticly
[12:43:53] <arschmitz> $.extend( this, {foo:"bar"});
[12:43:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/next/js/widgets/forms/button.js
[12:44:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, thanks
[12:44:36] <arschmitz> no prob
[12:44:50] <arschmitz> then after you initally store it that way you can just do this.buttonClasses
[12:44:53] <arschmitz> anywhere
[12:45:30] <uGoMobi> great
[12:46:29] <arschmitz> and if for any reason you needed to get it externally you can still do $(selector).data("mobilebutton").buttonClasses
[12:47:15] <uGoMobi> awesome
[12:48:15] <arschmitz> range slider does both things retreving external data and saving data to the widget if you want to look at that for anything
[12:49:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz _|Nix|_ : BTW - why does the widget factory add 2 classes (mobile-button-disabled ui-state-disabled) when you disable a form element
[12:49:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, will give rangeslider a look to make sure I do it right
[12:49:37] <arschmitz> widget factory always adds ui-state disabled
[12:49:54] <arschmitz> but when a lot of the widgets were made people didnt realize
[12:49:59] <uGoMobi> yeah, I added that one to our CSS
[12:50:07] <arschmitz> and made their own disabled class
[12:50:15] <uGoMobi> so we don't need to add ui-disabled anymore
[12:50:27] <arschmitz> we dont need mobile-button-disabled
[12:50:38] <arschmitz> everything should use ui-state-disabled
[12:50:46] <uGoMobi> right, not sure where that mobile-button-disabled is coming from
[12:51:49] <arschmitz> let me peak at widget factory maybe it adds a generic and specific one
[12:55:07] <arschmitz> yeah looks like its all widget factory 
[12:55:21] <arschmitz> we had another disabled class and i thought it was that one but i was wrong
[12:55:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it adds a widget specific disabled class and a generic disabled class
[12:56:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see, so nothing much we can do about it
[12:56:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks for looking
[12:56:10] <arschmitz> nope
[12:56:18] <arschmitz> no problem its actually a good idea
[12:56:24] <arschmitz> that way you can have universal stuff
[12:56:43] <arschmitz> but if a widget needs special css specific to that widget there is a class for that too

[13:19:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Moving ui-disabled to ui-state-disabled is actually part of the widget review.
[13:20:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The ui-<widget>-disabled class is being added in case there is something widget-specific you need to do.
[13:20:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I saw your comment in the code
[13:20:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess arschmitz said the same thing :)

[13:22:31] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:22:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You should mark it as deprecated.
[13:23:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: good point
[13:23:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: just comented on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5917#issuecomment-16820145 you also commented im thinking we should just close this
[13:23:26] <b-ot> arschmitz: Issue #5917 by deekshabs (9h 3m ago): Panel closes if toggle button is moved from On to Off state
[13:24:26] <arschmitz> wanted to get your oppinion first though
[13:24:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: good one, I forgot that it was an option
[13:25:12] <arschmitz> yeah i added that option because i was trying to use a slider in a panel and noticed the issue back pre beta
[13:25:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I actually thought I removed the flip toggle from all demos, because I already noticed the issue before
[13:26:10] <uGoMobi> I suggest we remove it in next release :)
[13:26:35] <arschmitz> ha ha yeah
[13:26:37] <uGoMobi> from all panel demos I mean
[13:26:45] <arschmitz> yup
[13:27:03] <uGoMobi> don't want to add a check in the code
[13:27:06] <arschmitz> maybe make a note about it some where on the panels pages 
[13:27:13] <uGoMobi> bad for performance
[13:27:53] <arschmitz> problem is swipe target is not reliable
[13:27:55] <uGoMobi> not sure if you can prevent it with custom code
[13:28:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I know, you told me before
[13:28:22] <arschmitz> its preventable with custom code
[13:28:38] <arschmitz> but very dependant on their exact layout
[13:28:54] <uGoMobi> gotcha
[13:28:56] <arschmitz> and probably would have to prevent the event from bubbleing
[13:30:08] <arschmitz> i think its just not worth supporting unless we get a lot of complaints about it
[13:30:22] <uGoMobi> I agree
[13:30:33] <arschmitz> ok so ill comment and close
[13:30:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, thanks
[13:30:45] <agcolom> toddmparker: Have you seen this: http://www.jquery4u.com/mobile/nativedroid-free-theme-jquery-mobile-1-3/
[13:32:06] <johnbender> toddmparker: uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: arschmitz: I'm going to start making a list of things from nav that belong in a content container widget
[13:32:19] <johnbender> hopefully that will help me get started on the refactor
[13:32:38] <johnbender> I've been poking around the edges for a few weeks now and it's hard to find an entry point
[13:32:43] <arschmitz> johnbender sounds awesome
[13:32:53] <johnbender> I'll let you guys know when I have something
[13:32:55] <uGoMobi> johnbender: great
[13:33:05] <arschmitz> johnbender: let me know if theres anything i can help with
[13:33:09] <johnbender> I'm also going to try and document as much of what I'm doing as possible in case I get hit by a bus or something
[13:33:24] <arschmitz> johnbender: good thinking lol
[13:33:25] <johnbender> arschmitz: I will
[13:38:24] <toddmparker> agcolom: this looks great! http://nativedroid.godesign.ch/
[13:38:49] <toddmparker> let's link that up, i'll tweet
[13:42:10] <toddmparker> johnbender: great
[13:42:40] <toddmparker> the more we can contain nav into a crisp little world, it's a big win
[13:43:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm... I am not sure if I can use $.extend( this, { buttonClasses: classes });
[13:44:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: why?
[13:44:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in _create I add ui-btn and ui-btn-left/right
[13:44:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: and in refresh all the style classes
[13:44:51] <uGoMobi> and in refresh I only need to remove the style classes
[13:45:42] <arschmitz> why dont you just do two seperate vars then?
[13:45:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was about to say that
[13:45:58] <uGoMobi> (thinking while typing)
[13:45:59] <arschmitz> :)
[13:46:05] <uGoMobi> thanks anyway :)
[13:46:17] <arschmitz> no prob great minds right?? lol
[13:46:56] <uGoMobi> lol right

[14:10:19] <uGoMobi> good night all
[14:12:21] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper :)
[14:14:54] <agcolom> toddmparker: yes, it's totally gorgeous! A friend in France pointed out to me! Really good stuff! Will add to the resources page... 
[14:54:04] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Wow! Really awesome theme!
[15:01:09] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes, nice find :)
[15:04:39] <archfool> Has the "collapsible" and "collapsible-set" been improved from 1.3.1 to 1.4.x?  
[15:05:24] <_|Nix|_> archfool: What sort of improvement are you looking for?
[15:06:52] <archfool> within a collapsable-set, If "collapsable1" is open, and I expand "collapsable2", the whole thing scrolls up because collapsable1 had to close, and I don't see the collapsable2 base element.  It's above the viewable screen.
[15:07:12] <archfool> UI intuition says that if I click/tap on an item, it stays on-screen.
[15:07:30] <_|Nix|_> archfool: There's an issue/PR about that.
[15:07:46] <_|Nix|_> archfool: Not sure what the timeline is for our looking at that.
[15:08:34] <archfool> It's been that way since 1.1.0. :(
[15:09:08] <archfool> And it makes an extremely annoying user experience.
[15:10:11] <archfool> issue 5394?
[15:11:05] <_|Nix|_> archfool: There it is! So, I guess it's milestoned for 1.4.0 ... 
[15:11:29] <_|Nix|_> archfool: That means it should be there in 1.4.0, unless some other issue crops up and takes up all of our time ...
[15:23:53] <toddmparker> scrolling is a good idea, but there are a bunch of edge cases that can be wonky
[15:24:07] <toddmparker> we reviewed at least 1 PR for this and it felt worse
[15:24:27] <toddmparker> mostly because there were cases where things felt too jumpy when you scroleld
[15:40:03] <gseguin> johnbender: so are you saying that you have started the effort somewhere?
[15:40:22] <johnbender> gseguin: the basics of using benchmark.js are done in the perf branch
[15:40:39] <johnbender> gseguin: it makes writing perf tests about as easy as writing normal tests 
[15:40:54] <gseguin> ok, so now it's a matter of figuring out if browserscope will work for us?
[15:40:58] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/perf/tests/perf/button-markup/perf.js
[15:41:16] <johnbender> gseguin: the important thing to keep in mind is that there isn't any persistance
[15:41:49] <johnbender> I want to leave that until we are actually making use of it
[15:41:55] <johnbender> I wasted too much time last goround
[15:42:20] <gseguin> isn't persistence, what browserscope is about?
[15:43:18] <johnbender> gseguin: o.O
[15:43:26] <johnbender> gseguin: awesome
[15:43:29] <johnbender> gseguin: just googled
[15:43:53] <gseguin> that's what jsperf uses
[15:44:02] <johnbender> gseguin: gar, I thought that was internal
[15:44:06] <johnbender> gseguin: then yes please do
[15:44:17] <johnbender> or I can do that too
[15:44:35] <gseguin> the only thing we need is a jqm gmail account I think
[15:44:52] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/perf/tests/perf/suite.js#L15
[15:44:58] <johnbender> just dump the reporting somewhere in there
[15:45:12] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm 
[15:45:15] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: you about?
[15:45:38] <gseguin> oh cool
[15:45:43] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: sorta
[15:46:04] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: are you guys connected to browserscope for anything?
[15:46:14] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: this is something we can discuss tomorrow if you're busy
[15:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> you guys = jQuery?
[15:47:33] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: UI
[15:47:37] <scott_gonzalez> no
[15:47:56] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: my next question was going to be that very thing but I'm guessing the answer will remain "no"
[15:48:21] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: is there a project google acount?
[15:48:23] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery doesn't use browserscope for anything.
[15:48:43] <scott_gonzalez> no
[15:48:46] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: is there any reason we shouldn't?
[15:48:56] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm, maybe just get todd's and use that?
[15:49:03] <johnbender> that's as canonical as I can think of right now
[15:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> What do you want to use it for?
[15:49:11] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[15:49:25] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: recording perf data over time
[15:49:48] <scott_gonzalez> You should talk to DaveMethvin about that.
[15:49:56] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: noted
[15:50:09] <scott_gonzalez> There's already a perf testing system being worked on.
[15:50:32] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: nice, we'll make sure to catch up with him
[15:50:57] <scott_gonzalez> What are you planning to run the tests on?
[15:51:04] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: browser wise?
[15:51:09] <scott_gonzalez> machine wise
[15:51:17] <scott_gonzalez> The problem with storing historical perf data is that the environment can never change.
[15:51:24] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: not sure hopefully something consistent :)
[15:51:25] <scott_gonzalez> Otherwise the data loses meaning.
[15:51:45] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: my initial setup was purely for manual testing across patches
[15:52:00] <johnbender> automation introduces issues (eg consistency)
[15:52:15] <scott_gonzalez> I use browserscope for http://dev-test.nemikor.com/web-storage/support-test/
[15:52:24] <johnbender> well, automation/info storage
[15:52:29] <scott_gonzalez> Which resulted in a change in their JSON format :-P
[15:53:30] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: alright, we'll talk with Dave
