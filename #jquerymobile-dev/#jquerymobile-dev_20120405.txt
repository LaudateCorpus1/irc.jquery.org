[06:51:10] <deAtog> hello everyone.. I decided to try HEAD and navigation seems completely broken now
[06:59:45] <deAtog> at the moment, I can only seem to get it to do one page transition after that all other transitions fail to do anything
[07:02:46] <toddparker> deAtog: was this with a local copy of master?
[07:06:08] <Wilto> Let’s go Red Sox (clap clap clap-clap-clap).
[07:06:16] <Wilto> —Oh, I meant, “hello.” What an odd typo.

[07:22:23] <Wilto> jzaefferer: _Brilliant_.
[07:30:51] <toddparker> that second one made me choke on my coffee

[09:24:22] <Wilto> The accumulated brokenness of their servers will foam up about their waists, and all the jQuery Mobile devs will look up and shout “save us!” And danheberden will look down and whisper “no.”
[09:24:35] <danheberden> haha

[09:25:53] <kinblas> Wilto: I was trying to fix that iphone orientation bug
[09:26:27] <kinblas> where I was experimenting with replacing the media query I added with simple innerWidth and innerHeight comparisons
[09:26:48] <kinblas> and it doesn't work reliably ... at least on iPhone because the user could have turned on the developer console
[09:26:58] <kinblas> which makes the window width wider than the height
[09:26:58] <Wilto> Ugh, right. Forgot about that thing.

The bug in 1.1rc with 1.7.2 is fixed in the current HEAD o

[09:42:14] <bot-t> (16 hours 50 mins ago) <jzaefferer> tell johnbender Apache is serving files for TestSwarm test runs, so yes, there's a direct link

[09:49:32] <johnbender> Wilto: sure
[09:49:35] <Wilto> Seems like it’s at least my-wheelhouse-adjacent, if not right in there.
[09:49:38] <johnbender> I'm working on the hover delay
[09:49:46] <johnbender> should be quick though
[09:49:59] <Wilto> kinblas, you’re back on the clock today, yeah? Or just checkin’ in?
[09:50:50] <deAtog> johnbender: http://dev.itreetools.org/ellingsd/itreet/home.php <- page transitions don't work after the first transition
[09:51:07] <johnbender> deAtog: can you register an issue on github?
[09:51:11] <Wilto> The last couple issues are all piled on johnbender; I’m thinking we can each grab one or two and hammer this sucker out once and for all today.
[09:51:29] <johnbender> Wilto: yah don't hesitate to grab them
[09:51:44] <johnbender> I'm splitting time with the rails app/blerg post for work
[09:51:45] <deAtog> johnbender: url?
[09:51:55] <Wilto> Yeah, deAtog: this channel is really for the sake of letting the jQM devs coordinate. We can’t really jump on issues as they’re posted in here—the issue tracker is your best bet.
[09:52:07] <johnbender> deAtog: github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues
[09:52:37] <Wilto> Who else is gettin’ they bugfix on today? gseguin?
[09:53:04] <deAtog> Wilto: ok.. I just thought you all should know.. it just broke within the last 20 or so commits
[09:53:14] <kinblas> Wilto: just checking in ... I'm feeling guilty that I haven't fixed the orientation thing yet
[09:53:18] <Wilto> DAMMIT, KIN
[09:53:38] <kinblas> Wilto: you can use me as the new scapegoat since scottjehl is back
[09:53:39] <kinblas> :-P
[09:53:40] <Wilto> deAtog: Better to post stuff in the issue tracker, especially if it’s urgent.
[09:54:45] <Wilto> kinblas: No worries, dude. Orientation change ==
[09:54:46] <Wilto> jongel
[09:55:05] <Wilto> ( See: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2011Aug/0390.html )
[09:55:08] <kinblas> Wilto: I guess my worry is that it affects iPhone only ... and that is uh ... a big deal
[09:55:22] <Wilto> I’ve never heard of those. Is that like an eMachine?
[09:55:32] <kinblas> I updated basecamp with details so let me know what you guys think
[09:55:34] <Wilto> Yes, very much agreed. Stay the course, dude.
[09:57:52] <Wilto> Wait, kinblas:
[09:58:03] <Wilto> What do you get with `screen.outerWidth`?
[09:58:19] <kinblas> there is no screen.outerWidth, just screen.width
[09:58:24] <kinblas> there is window.outerWidth
[09:58:34] <kinblas> but surprisingly is reports the exact same values as window.innerWIdth
[09:58:43] <Wilto> Oh, right, meant `window`.
[09:58:50] <kinblas> as does $( window ).width()
[09:58:50] <Wilto> Hm.
[09:59:34] <kinblas> and as mentioned in basecamp, the screen.width/height *ALWAYS* report values as if the device is in portrait mode
[09:59:42] <Wilto> Guessing availWidth is the same deal?
[10:00:04] <kinblas> Wilto: I can try that too hang on a sec
[10:01:56] <Wilto> `body.client[Width | Height]`? That’s a little shaky, though.
[10:03:12] <Wilto> That’s all I got. Other than Scott’s thing where he injects a hidden `position: fixed` element and measures that.
[10:03:38] <kinblas> Wilto: availWidth/availHeight are pretty much the same as screen.width/height
[10:03:50] <kinblas> they never change with device orientation changes
[10:03:59] <Wilto> DAMMIT, APPLE
[10:04:14] <kinblas> Wilto: I think the best we can do is that threshold thing I suggested
[10:04:26] <kinblas> if it fails, we're no worst off than we were in 1.0
[10:04:58] <Wilto> Looks solid to me.
[10:05:19] <Wilto> And yeah, like you said: not gonna make things worse in any case.

[11:56:59] <deAtog> scottjehl: you broke slide transitions

[11:58:15] <scottjehl> @gseguin ok cool shoot
[11:58:15] <gseguin> there were 4 votes against it during the meeting, I know you spent a lot of time finding that trick
[11:58:33] <scottjehl> hmm.
[11:58:46] <gseguin> does it seem reasonable to remove it in 1.2?
[11:59:06] <scottjehl> well, it's the only way I'm aware of. what's the reason for removal?
[12:00:13] <gseguin> one is, with the current state of 1.7.1 if the user uses a delegated click handler on a a href, the href will be # all the time
[12:01:01] <gseguin> the other is we don't know what users will come up with next where they'll find themselves in the same situation
[12:02:50] <gseguin> so I should rephrase, it was more a concern about changing the href than a question
[12:08:21] <gseguin> gotta run
[12:12:59] <Wilto> oh god lunch gonna pass out back soon

[12:51:17] <toddparker> hey tbenzige
[12:51:23] <toddparker> sorry, was in meetings
[12:52:12] <toddparker> looking good
[12:52:17] <toddparker> won't open in chrome
[12:52:23] <toddparker> but in ff, i can see
[12:54:18] <toddparker> ah -the inspector toggle is meant to be a single button - that was meant to show you on/off states
[12:54:29] <tbenzige> oh gotcha
[12:54:31] <tbenzige> makes sense
[12:54:40] <tbenzige> ill take a look at chrome issue
[12:54:49] <toddparker> buttons need to be wider…text seems to be wrapping out of the buttons in FF10
[12:55:02] <toddparker> undo works great
[12:56:18] <tbenzige> yeah? good
[12:56:23] <tbenzige> i need to do a lot more testing
[12:56:28] <toddparker> awesome actually
[12:56:31] <tbenzige> ill fix the width issue
[12:56:46] <tbenzige> is that all thats wrong in chrome?
[12:59:34] <toddparker> odd, chrome is ok again
[12:59:37] <toddparker> was seeing a blank page
[12:59:55] <toddparker> buttons are ok there wrapping-wise
[13:00:05] <toddparker> think my FF isn't getting the font maybe
[13:00:39] <toddparker> in the recent colors, i sort of want the ability to open the picker
[13:00:54] <toddparker> to choose a new color
[13:01:37] <toddparker> guess we could add a square with the arrow in it next to the "recent Colors" label (far right) that would open the farbtastic
[13:02:14] <toddparker> not sure
[13:02:36] <toddparker> but being able to pick any color, then drag it into the preview would be helpful
[13:03:28] <toddparker> thought you could drag a color from the left inspector into the preview
[13:03:36] <toddparker> tbenzige ^
[13:04:58] <tbenzige> sorry. i was messing with the layout
[13:05:09] <tbenzige> no you cant drag from the left into the preview
[13:05:21] <tbenzige> you can drag from the quickswatch colors into a field in the inspector panel
[13:05:26] <tbenzige> we can reverse it too
[13:05:37] <tbenzige> and a create custom color draggable has been requested before
[13:05:43] <tbenzige> we can defeinitely add that as well
[13:07:14] <tbenzige> there are definitely issues with the fonts
[13:07:22] <tbenzige> i still havent switched to Lato
[13:07:31] <tbenzige> do we want the whole app to be in lato?
[13:09:26] <Wilto> Eh, nobody uses fonts nowadays.

[13:20:19] <Wilto> johnbender: Looks like collapsible sets aren’t obeying data-corners="false" at all.
[13:22:59] <johnbender> Wilto: that's not good
[13:23:11] <Wilto> Not Ideal™.
[13:23:26] <Wilto> Easy enough to deal with, though.
[13:23:32] <gnarf> johnbender: on a mobile standpoint btw--- is it possible to have a button with two lines of text in it? i was trying to pull it off but everything i tried was failing
[13:23:45] <gnarf> i wanna be able to do like <button>2<sub>abc</sub></button>
[13:25:22] <Wilto> From a validity standpoint that’s fine, but I wouldn’t be surprised if mobile browsers choked on it.
[13:25:37] <Wilto> Can’t say as I’ve tried it myself.
[13:27:55] <Wilto> gnarf: When you say “failing,” just outta curiosity…
[13:28:47] <gnarf> Wilto: it seems to convert all <button>'s to <input type="button">
[13:28:51] <gnarf> so you can't have html inside it
[13:28:54] <gnarf> which is kinda annoying
[13:28:58] <gnarf> cuz i want <button>
[13:28:59] <gnarf> :)
[13:29:14] <gnarf> it renders 2<sub>abc</sub> as "2abc"
[13:34:01] <Wilto> Wait.
[13:34:05] <Wilto> It should still be a <button>.
[13:34:25] <Wilto> I don’t think we mess with the markup inside it, either…

[14:14:25] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Collapsible sets now respect data-corners attribute. - Mat Marquis
[14:32:59] <gnarf> Wilto: http://jsfiddle.net/MYeUC/
[14:33:44] <gnarf> Wilto: seems all html inside the <button> is irrelevant due to the ui-btn-hidden
[14:33:51] <Wilto> Hmm.
[14:33:57] <gnarf> and the <span> doesn't pick up the html
[14:35:04] <Wilto> Ohh, oh, okay, yeah.
[14:35:24] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/MYeUC/1/ just feels dirty
[14:35:25] <gnarf> it works
[14:35:26] <Wilto> Sorry. I was thinking that we just wrapped the button.
[14:35:27] <Wilto> Yeah, so we’re grabbing .text() or something.
[14:35:30] <gnarf> but it feels dirty
[14:35:40] <Wilto> Lil’ bit.
[14:35:43] <gnarf> maybe it should be grabbing .html() ?
[14:35:54] <gnarf> at least on a <button>
[14:35:54] <Wilto> Prolly. I mean, that’s valid usage.
[14:36:06] <gnarf> obvs on <input type="button"> you need to do .text( .val() )
[14:36:10] <Wilto> Can you chuck a bug in the tracker? I’ll grab it ASAP—we’re kind of drawing the line on 1.1 stuff.
[14:36:24] <gnarf> but for <button> it should prolly be .html( .html() )
[14:36:29] <Wilto> But I can sort that for 1.2.
[14:36:31] <Wilto> Yeah, agreed.
[14:36:35] <gnarf> yeah - github issues, or is there another trac?
[14:36:45] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/
[14:36:48] <Wilto> Right thurr.
[14:36:50] <Wilto> Thanks, dude.
[14:44:29] <gnarf> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3975
[14:44:30] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3975 on jquery-mobile (gnarf37; 0.535s ago): Buttons should allow HTML when coming from a <button>
[14:44:57] <Wilto> And snagged. Thanks.
[14:46:21] <gnarf> Wilto: A 1.1 fix would be hot, but I understand release cycles ;)
[14:46:33] <gnarf> my app is running on a custom built UI 1.9 pre right now
[14:46:35] <gnarf> :)
[14:46:54] <Wilto> I’ll see if I can sneak it in during 1.1RC2; just don’t tell johnbender.
[14:47:37] <gnarf> johnbender: ^^^ ;)

[15:00:43] <toddparker> just finished testing everything we got and things look great
[15:00:54] <toddparker> think we're about ready to roll johnbender
[15:03:54] <deAtog> I've got a patch for issue 3970 who can apply it?
[15:07:03] <deAtog> toddparker: can you apply a patch to head for me?

[15:09:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Final docs changes to support RC2 - toddparker
[15:10:02] <toddparker> deAtog: probably nobody
[15:10:07] <toddparker> we're locked for rc2
[15:10:10] <toddparker> pencils down
[15:10:28] <toddparker> but if you submit a pull request, we'll give this a look for the next release
[15:10:52] <deAtog> it fixes a bug in the current HEAD of master affecting all Mozilla based browsers
[15:10:58] <toddparker> ok johnbender - i think we're ready to do our deploy and test the CDN
[15:11:02] <toddparker> is this for the slide?
[15:11:07] <deAtog> yes
[15:11:25] <toddparker> ah, well definitely submit a PR ASAP
[15:11:40] <toddparker> we were just looking at that but didn't get far along on debugging it
[15:11:46] <toddparker> what is the issue?
[15:11:57] <deAtog> I don't have a public repo but can send a patch
[15:12:22] <deAtog> there was a couple of typos in the css for slide transitions
[15:12:59] <toddparker> ah, that's it?
[15:13:04] <toddparker> i was sort of guessing that
[15:13:27] <toddparker> put it up and i'll give it a test
[15:13:29] <deAtog> yup.. pretty minor.. was difficult to notice
[15:13:37] <toddparker> this is the one thing we did want to get patched up
[15:13:41] <toddparker> awesome
[15:13:48] <toddparker> appreciate this

[15:15:47] <toddparker> ok, we're idiots. gotta get the right prefixes, huh?
[15:16:06] <deAtog> simple copy paste issue
[15:17:37] <toddparker> yep. always is. or an android bug :)
[15:18:08] <toddparker> do you have the issue # handy?
[15:18:17] <deAtog> 3970
[15:20:14] <toddparker> perfect

[15:38:32] <toddparker> ^^ mega commit to update the footer. sorry for the churn. we need to get some includes going in the docs.
[15:39:06] <ajpiano> toddparker: i just tested jquerymobile.com/test in b2g firefox
[15:39:11] <ajpiano> and i can't scroll the page
[15:39:27] <toddparker> really?
[15:39:27] <johnbender> ...
[15:39:29] <johnbender> wtf
[15:39:39] <toddparker> what the, yeah
[15:39:41] <ajpiano> also using this phone is a complete turd
[15:39:45] <toddparker> heh
[15:39:59] <toddparker> sorta like mobile FF, but an entire OS worth?
[15:40:02] <johnbender> ajpiano: the hardware is nice though!
[15:40:12] <toddparker> johnbender: you have one?
[15:40:12] <ajpiano> it runs like a joke
[15:40:22] <toddparker> FF seems pokey on mobile in general
[15:40:23] <johnbender> toddparker: its the nexus, the one you got the other day
[15:40:33] <johnbender> toddparker: FF is pokey on linux
[15:40:33] <toddparker> ah, that is a nice one
[15:40:43] <toddparker> i have the latest FF on that and I can scroll the page
[15:40:44] <johnbender> with an i5 and 6 gigs of ram :P
[15:40:54] <toddparker> tho there are 2 FF's in Play. FF and FF beta
[15:41:02] <toddparker> not sure which is what
[15:41:02] <johnbender> I still use it thought because I can't live without vimperator
[15:41:11] <kinblas> toddparker: you will let me know when/if I should land that fix after you test right?
[15:41:44] <toddparker> anyway, I have FF beta (just downloaded today) on a Galaxy Nexus running ICS and scrolling is smooooth
[15:41:45] <ajpiano> toddparker: if you are trying to get your hands on one at filemanet
[15:41:59] <ajpiano> i bet ben or boaz would probably be willing to let you check theirs out
[15:42:05] <toddparker> kinblas: is that up and ready to test?
[15:42:15] <toddparker> good idea
[15:42:25] <johnbender> toddparker: I think he merged in to 1.2
[15:42:28] <toddparker> i just asked a ff guy about getting one…we'll see
[15:42:33] <toddparker> ah, ok
[15:42:38] <toddparker> lemme pull that down
[15:42:48] <toddparker> i have like 20+ devices scattered around me
[15:42:52] <toddparker> all set up to test
[15:43:42] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah I pushed it during the meeting and mentioned it in the chat and on basecamp :-)
[15:43:45] <johnbender> toddparker: I have to catch my bus in an hour or so but I can do the deploy from home at some point tonight if you like
[15:43:54] <toddparker> ok
[15:43:58] <kinblas> toddparker: it's in the 1.2 branch
[15:44:02] <johnbender> just giving you the heads up
[15:44:03] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/
[15:44:17] <toddparker> i just want to quickly test kins fix to see if we should land that
[15:44:28] <toddparker> should only take 30 minutes tops
[15:44:37] <johnbender> toddparker: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/1.2/ should have it
[15:44:39] <toddparker> kinblas: can you remind me of the path
[15:44:44] <LakWork> so you guys will appreciate the stupidity of this... we've been building a jquery mobile ecommerce site for the last 8 weeks and we're just about ready to launch. we havent had any time to test and we have no devices other than a few iphones/android devices scattered around the office. The plan from the boss: Finish monday, test top to bottom tuesday and wednesday, launch thursday
[15:44:44] <kinblas> toddparker: I need to step out for an hour in 5 minutes ... send me email as to whether or not to land.
[15:44:54] <toddparker> ok
[15:45:02] <toddparker> is that something bender could do for you?
[15:45:08] <LakWork> (this is NOT a small website)
[15:45:08] <toddparker> is it just that single commit?
[15:45:20] <toddparker> LakWork: jQM?
[15:45:24] <LakWork> aye
[15:45:30] <kinblas> toddparker:  the test file is here http://jquerymobile.com/branches/1.2/tests/functional/orientation.html
[15:45:30] <toddparker> that's for sure
[15:45:34] <toddparker> cool
[15:45:54] <kinblas> toddparker: my change was a one liner, plus a dependency removal ... and the rest was comment updates to reflect the change
[15:45:56] <LakWork> www.scorebig.com will launch a mobile version next week
[15:46:15] <kinblas> toddparker: anyways, shoot me an email for the go/no-go
[15:46:22] <toddparker> ok
[15:46:34] <toddparker> remind me of testing steps so i do this right
[15:46:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] jzaefferer created gruntonly (+2 new commits): http://git.io/DFKtzw
[15:46:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/gruntonly] Build: Replace css-yuiminifier with grunt/grunt-css/sqwish. Grunt on its own won't work, for now - Jörn Zaefferer
[15:46:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/gruntonly] Build: Use grunt also for minifiying, effectively replacing closure-compiler with uglifyjs, produces about the same filesize, 89K for both min.js files - Jörn Zaefferer
[15:47:03] <toddparker> best. commit. ever.
[15:47:15] <johnbender> jq-jenkins:
[15:47:15] <jq-jenkins> johnbender did you mean me? Unknown command ''
[15:47:16] <jq-jenkins> Use '!jenkins help' to get help!
[15:47:21] <johnbender> jzaefferer: thanks man
[15:47:24] <toddparker> i see yummy, grunt, squish
[15:47:30] <toddparker> eww
[15:48:09] <jzaefferer> Those commit messages may contain various typos, you're welcome ;)
[15:49:19] <johnbender> jzaefferer: it's no fun without typos
[15:49:21] <jzaefferer> johnbender: you should be able to require('r.js') and run that from within grunt.js itself, will remove another process
[15:49:23] * johnbender is the king of typos
[15:49:30] <johnbender> jzaefferer: that's the plan
[15:50:18] <jzaefferer> for zip we haven't found a good node module yet, but grunt.util.spawn helps to use cli zip
[15:50:41] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/grunt.js#L393
[15:51:54] <jzaefferer> the concat task will help replace a lot of makefile
[15:52:18] <jzaefferer> other tasks look like they mostly just copy files, you can do that with registerTask and grunt.file.copy
[15:52:50] <jzaefferer> deploy task might get tricky, but that shouldn't matter for nightly builds, right?
[15:53:13] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah I pulled that stuff out
[15:53:22] <johnbender> so deploy should be the only one pushing files
[15:53:30] <jzaefferer> but generally, with those two changes, not more jvm spawning, so should run a lot better
[15:53:33] <jzaefferer> *no
[15:53:36] <johnbender> yessir
[15:54:12] <jzaefferer> good fight, good night!
[16:05:59] <toddparker> johnbender: kins fix works like a charm
[16:06:05] <johnbender> toddparker: great
[16:06:13] <toddparker> Android 4.0 - works
[16:06:14] <toddparker> Kindle Fire (2.3) - works

[16:06:14] <toddparker> iPad (iOS5.1) -works
[16:06:15] <toddparker> Palm Touchpad (3.0.2) - works
[16:06:17] <johnbender> toddparker: we'll have to cherry pick that over to master then
[16:06:23] <toddparker> ok
[16:06:36] <toddparker> testing a few oddballs but those are the key ones
[16:13:13] <toddparker> all good johnbender
[16:13:19] <toddparker> works everywhere like a charm
[16:13:29] <toddparker> unless you have a square screen :)
[16:13:32] <toddparker> Palm Pixi does
[16:44:20] <toddparker> johnbender and kinblas - I commented on that issue with full results. It all checks out so this should go into 1.1 tonight. Lock n load

[16:44:41] <johnbender> toddparker: alright I'll pull that in and then do a deploy tonight
[16:44:52] <toddparker> excellent
[16:44:55] <johnbender> I'll post to basecamp when it's ready
[16:45:01] <toddparker> just let me know when it's up so i can test
[16:45:03] <toddparker> perfect
[16:45:40] <toddparker> gseguin: if you can email me the blurb about 1.7.2 event stuff so I can explain that in the post, send it my way
[16:45:55] <toddparker> unless johnbender knows how to explain this simply
[16:52:14] <gnarf> im trying to figure out why it is whenever i notice some bug in a library - it always seems to be mid branch freeze :)
