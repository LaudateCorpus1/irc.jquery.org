[07:50:38] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by hpbuniat (3m, 2d ago): Slider: Support for a range-theme
[07:50:51] <johnbender> is that something we want to support from a usability perspective?
[07:54:38] <Wilto> Commits from the ghost in the machine! Soon I won’t be able to “DAMMIT SCOTT” anymore.
[07:57:52] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2418
[07:57:53] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by 1Marc (2m, 3w ago): Force scrollbar overflow y
[08:01:17] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_: I'll definitely need your help there
[08:02:39] <Wilto> johnbender: http://wil.to/_/outrage.gif
[08:04:18] <Wilto> I just wanted an excuse to use that.
[08:06:31] <johnbender> that's a good one
[08:11:25] <Wilto> I got Android concerns on that overflow thing.
[08:11:37] <johnbender> Wilto: that's why I asked :D
[08:11:38] <Wilto> Happy to investigate, though.
[08:22:36] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2533
[08:22:36] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by adrianpike (2m, 1w ago): Issue #1259 - When we're setting a header or footer to a width of 100%, a
[08:22:41] <johnbender> another fun one I'm dumping on your plate
[08:23:03] <Wilto> Bwuh.
[08:23:30] <johnbender> ?tell kinblas started early but I'm heading in late to the "office"
[08:23:30] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[08:25:36] <johnbender> I'm going to set up an irc proxy for everyone so we don't need leave messages
[08:25:38] <johnbender> this is silly
[08:39:35] <johnbender> kinblas:
[08:39:41] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2439
[08:39:42] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by koeun (2m, 3w ago): Fix for issue: vmouse doesn't have offset property
[08:40:05] <johnbender> kinblas: I commented, just wondering if you have a chance to take a look
[08:42:17] <kinblas> johnbender: my hesitation at this point is just paying the perf cost for those non-standard properties
[08:42:18] <bot-t> (18 mins 40 secs ago) <johnbender> tell kinblas started early but I'm heading in late to the "office"
[08:43:05] <johnbender> kinblas: I looked at the properties according to quirksmode they're supported
[08:43:17] <kinblas> on every platform?
[08:43:23] <johnbender> .offsetParent and .scrollLeft
[08:43:24] <johnbender> yah
[08:43:48] <johnbender> kinblas: http://www.quirksmode.org/dom/w3c_cssom.html
[08:43:53] <johnbender> unless I'm misunderstanding that chart
[08:44:25] <johnbender> obviously that assumes that mobile webkit implementations are better than saf 4 / chrome 4
[08:47:40] <johnbender> kinblas: that was the very first thing I thought of too, though it probably is still worth perf testing
[08:47:49] <johnbender> and I though it would be nice to fuse the loops
[08:47:55] <johnbender> though that doesn't matter quite as much
[08:50:45] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah definitely merge the loops
[09:04:59] <kinblas> johnbender: so mozilla does not support it
[09:08:35] <johnbender> kinblas: offsetParent? is the chart there just wrong?
[09:08:57] <kinblas> johnbender: we're talking offsetX and offsetY on a mouse event
[09:09:29] <johnbender> kinblas: ah something totally different
[09:09:30] <johnbender> well then
[09:10:02] <johnbender> kinblas: I guess in that case we'd be paving over that omission then? :D
[09:10:45] <kinblas> johnbender: but only inthe touch case and not the mouse case?
[09:11:45] <johnbender> kinblas: hmm I didn't look at the code around the assignment, is it touch specific?
[09:11:59] * johnbender notes that we are playing the "answer with questions" game
[09:12:13] * johnbender notes that he is playing the "answer with questions" game
[09:13:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you guys have an invite to irccloud? I'm not interested in using it I just want to know what the feature set looks like
[09:13:34] <johnbender> ie, do they handle most of what a proxy would otherwise accomplish (eg always logged in)
[09:16:10] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah he's only calculating on touch events so this impacts all platforms that support touchstart/touchend
[09:16:42] <kinblas> johnbender: I guess to be up front, I always hesitate adding support for a non-standard property, unless it is supported by every platforms we support
[09:17:17] <kinblas> I think folks tend to stay away from it because Mozilla doesn't support it on their mouse events
[09:17:33] <johnbender> kinblas: and to be fair they can calculate with $.offset no?
[09:17:47] <kinblas> johnbender: yes
[09:17:57] <kinblas> they can calculate it themselves as that patch shows
[09:18:13] <kinblas> plus the other thing is
[09:18:19] <kinblas> when you access the offset properties
[09:18:25] <johnbender> kinblas: reflow
[09:18:37] <kinblas> it forces a synchronous reflow if one is pending
[09:18:38] <kinblas> right
[09:18:42] <kinblas> so perf is top of mind for me
[09:20:12] <johnbender> kinblas: closed it
[09:20:25] <kinblas> johnbender: sorry about the question with a question thing ... I was trying to look at it without my predetermined bias
[09:20:53] <johnbender> $.offset should be fine, though we might want to document that omission
[09:21:14] <johnbender> ok I'm heading into the office I'll be on in about 45 mins
[09:43:20] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ping
[09:45:08] <Wilto> I think he’s out for the day.
[09:45:54] <Wilto> Sorry; was obsessing over responsive images with Scott. Catching up now.
[09:52:04] <Wilto> Caught up. Something I can help with, kinblas?
[09:54:52] <Wilto> bot-t: tell johnbender One IRCCloud invite, headed your way.
[09:54:53] <bot-t> Wilto, Okay.
[10:01:03] <kinblas> Wilto: nah, was just curious why we didn't re-use the old jquery mobile basecamp
[10:01:39] <kinblas> Wilto: we already had some discussions from the past there, so some valuable info lives in the old one
[10:01:58] <Wilto> Ah—yeah, no idea. Before my time.
[14:16:46] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did you guys talk at all last week about the project roadmap?
[14:16:47] <bot-t> (4 hours 21 mins ago) <Wilto> tell johnbender One IRCCloud invite, headed your way.
[14:16:56] <johnbender> Wilto: thanks for the invite
[14:17:04] <Wilto> No problem, man.
[14:17:47] <johnbender> If I get time I'm going to set up an irc proxy so I (and anyone else who wants to use it) can stay online when our machines are offline so we can still recieve messages
[14:18:04] <johnbender> I was interested in irccloud's features in that regard, thus the invite request
[14:19:15] <johnbender> I was thinking it might be interesting to setup a ircproxy as a service for folks like me that don't necessarily want the overhead of setting up the server
[14:20:32] <Wilto> Oh, good idea. IRCCloud has been wicked convenient in terms of the proxy, but I could live without the client.
