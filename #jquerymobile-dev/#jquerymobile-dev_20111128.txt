[06:22:38] <jqm-jenkins-bot> luke: Typo correction for "followin" to "following"
[08:04:12] <Wilto> Morning, guys.
[10:03:59] <toddmparker_> hi all!
[10:08:57] <Wilto> Looks like itâ€™s just you, me, a tumbleweed, some crickets, and a book of clichÃ©s.
[10:08:57] <bot-t> (18 mins 20 secs ago) <vladikoff> tell Wilto is it Cyber Monday?
[10:09:27] <Wilto> â€¦?
[10:49:04] <toddmparker_> bunch of slackers
[10:49:21] <toddmparker_> mobile frameworks don't just build themselves people!
[10:49:24] <Wilto> Right?
[11:02:20] <kinblas> heh
[11:19:43] <toddmparker_> hey kinblas
[11:19:47] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender
[11:19:52] <kinblas> yo
[11:23:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: hey
[11:23:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm only on for a bit to check my vacation status
[11:24:11] <johnbender> but I'll check email throughout the day in case anything comes up
[11:24:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did we get the latest min library sorted?
[11:28:10] <toddmparker_> with eddie?
[11:28:30] <toddmparker_> not sure. seemed like you were working with him on that, sorry
[11:30:35] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I merged the change and asked him to add logging so that I can go in and look at the apache logs for things like this and then I didn't hear back
[11:38:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: well it appears to be sorted
[11:38:46] <johnbender> let me check if there's any logging added
[11:39:16] <toddmparker_> great news johnbender
[11:39:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: no logging
[11:40:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: not sure if you have a todo list outside the issues tracker but that would be a nice/simple addition for helping to diagnose these issues
[11:40:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: right now it just emails eddie the results
[11:40:15] <johnbender> :/
[11:44:31] <toddmparker_> that's no good. can you just add yourself?
[11:44:55] <toddmparker_> i think he did that because it was going to send a lot of emails.
[11:47:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah, I've no experience with php's logging facilities but I'll monkey around locally first
[11:47:20] <toddmparker_> cool
[11:47:26] <toddmparker_> so you're out today?
[11:47:34] <johnbender> thats the only reason I asked him to do it
[11:47:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah
[11:47:40] <johnbender> until friday
[11:47:42] <johnbender> actually
[11:47:44] <johnbender> kinblas: ^
[11:47:49] <johnbender> err
[11:47:52] <johnbender> including friday
[11:47:58] <johnbender> I need to double check what I requested though :/
[11:48:24] <kinblas> johnbender: slacker
[11:48:38] <kinblas> johnbender: sittin' on the beach irc'ing
[11:49:12] <johnbender> kinblas: lol you know it

[12:20:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fix for #3185 - Dynamic Page load sample: In-Memory broken in IE7 - jblas@adobe.com
[12:23:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #319: FAILURE in 12 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/319/
[12:23:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> todd: Added initial-scale to the meta tags
[12:26:01] <johnbender> kinblas: is there anyway to log at a lower level with error_log?
[12:26:05] <johnbender> I'm not logging an error only a status
[12:26:18] <johnbender> but in the apacke logs it always goes to error
[12:26:26] <johnbender> I
[12:26:38] <johnbender> I've looked around for a similar function but I haven't found anything
[12:27:17] <johnbender> status_log seems intuitive but I've not found anything
[12:56:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: danheberden: I've added a logging mechanism to the bottom of the post commit hook for the jquerymobile site
[12:56:55] <johnbender> I've tested the crap out of it locally
[12:57:16] <toddmparker_> sweet johnbender
[12:57:19] <johnbender> so it should be fine and it's at the end of the script so it shouldn't matter but keep an eye out for issues
[12:57:35] <toddmparker_> ok, so you're going to commit this now then?
[12:57:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's not part of the repo, I think eddie moved the hooks out
[12:58:06] <johnbender> let me double check
[12:58:42] <johnbender> yah
[12:59:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's not part of the repo, I was thinking about that too as I was altering it
[12:59:27] <johnbender> it should be tracked in source control but not as part of the jqm project
[13:00:02] <johnbender> especially since it looks like you could DoS the server if you knew about the post commit hook :(
[13:00:09] <johnbender> not sure about that though
[13:00:54] <danheberden> johnbender exactly - the hooks will eventually be a separate thing in their own repo
[13:01:06] <danheberden> like, all together
[13:01:23] <danheberden> we're working out some new deployment stuff so it'll be a bit up in the air 'til then
[13:01:57] <johnbender> danheberden: cool beans
[13:02:34] <johnbender> danheberden: do we need to worry about all those synchronouse shell_execs ?
[13:02:48] <johnbender> s/synchronouse/synchronous/
[13:02:53] <danheberden> i haven't looked at the hook - is it bad?
[13:03:13] <johnbender> danheberden: I don't really know how apache would handle a ton of requests to that hook
[13:03:16] <johnbender> tbh
[13:04:14] <danheberden> might be worth, as we did for kuler, setting an ENV var that's used to process the page
[13:04:21] <danheberden> and providing that via github
[13:04:44] <johnbender> danheberden: ah you can provide arbitrary variables to the web hook eh?
[13:04:48] <johnbender> yah that would make this easy
[13:04:55] <johnbender> just do a sha hash and put it in both places
[13:04:58] <johnbender> with a check at the top
[13:05:00] <danheberden> yeah, just githook.php?zehsecrets=12345
[13:05:15] <johnbender> a very nice idea
[13:06:08] <toddmparker_> zeh secrets...
[13:06:23] <johnbender> danheberden: if you want to add a sha hash to the hook (since I don't have access) I can add it to the httpd.conf
[13:06:24] <toddmparker_> reminds me of inglorious basterds
[13:06:53] <johnbender> danheberden: might be good to double check with eddie before we do just in case we're not aware of something
[13:07:01] <danheberden> johnbender heh, i'm adding the apache env right now :p
[13:07:07] <johnbender> yar!
[13:07:11] <johnbender> danheberden: thanks
[13:10:17] <danheberden> though since the repo is privat
[13:10:19] <danheberden> ee
[13:10:29] <danheberden> *ugh - *private - the string can be arbitrary
[13:15:06] <danheberden> ?tell eddiemonge can you update the jqm gitpostcommit.php on jquerymobile.com with the one from the repo?
[13:15:07] <bot-t> danheberden, Okay.
[13:20:16] <johnbender> danheberden: thanks much sir, I assume you just added check + return at the top?
[13:20:24] <johnbender> or exit
[13:20:37] <johnbender> danheberden: actually is there any chance I can take a look at said repo?
[13:20:43] <johnbender> it's totally ok if it's not
[13:20:48] <danheberden> johnbender ya, lemme just add you and you can see what i did
[13:20:51] <danheberden> i already updated github
[13:20:54] <johnbender> yay!
[13:22:19] <danheberden> johnbender you *should* get an email about it i think
[13:22:50] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!

[13:24:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fix for #3185 - Dynamic Page load sample: In-Memory broken in IE7 - jblas@adobe.com
[13:46:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: well my logging attempt was an abysmal failure, it's pretty much unreadable
[13:47:40] <johnbender> the script places the logging results into an associate array which isn't very readble inline
[13:48:41] <toddmparker_> bummer
[13:49:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I'll work with eddie to get something in there that works
[13:49:58] <johnbender> danheberden: I didn't see an email, but I assume it's a github.com/jquery/* repo right?
[13:49:58] <toddmparker_> kk

[13:58:06] <danheberden> johnbender what's your username?
