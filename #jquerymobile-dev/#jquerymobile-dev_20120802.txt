[03:25:37] <agcolom> ?tell uGoMobi there is a small issue with the slider input field. There seems to a sizing rule for Mozilla only, so it appears small in Safari.
[04:00:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi! I don't see what you mean with that slider input issue
[04:00:33] <MauriceG> Hi all!
[04:00:40] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[04:00:47] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi
[04:01:15] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi,
[04:01:25] <agcolom> Hi Maurice!
[04:01:30] <MauriceG> Hi Anne!
[04:02:47] <agcolom> uGoMobi: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/slider/ on Safari
[04:03:08] <agcolom> the input filed is smaller
[04:04:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't see that on Safari/Win
[04:04:11] <MauriceG> agcolom: I've compared FF and Safari. In Safari the slider input gets this up/down buttons, in FF not. Font is 16px width 50px on both.
[04:04:40] <agcolom> interesting!
[04:05:18] <uGoMobi> yes, that's correct.. the browser adds those arrows, but you can see the right edge of the input field
[04:05:34] <uGoMobi> which shows they are of the same width
[04:05:37] <MauriceG> agcolom: May Zooming ?
[04:05:39] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I can do a screenshot if you like... for example the 0 of 150 gets cut
[04:05:46] <agcolom> MauriceG: ok, let me try!
[04:13:57] <agcolom> uGoMobi: MauriceG no zoom is on... and this is what I get in Safari: http://f.cl.ly/items/1S1Q2902103T2u1j3K1a/slider_small.tiff
[04:14:31] <MauriceG> agcolom: ? odd --  this is how it looks on Win: http://test.jqmobile.de/img/sliderffsafari.jpg
[04:15:43] <MauriceG> agcolom: Safari is 5.1.7 on Win
[04:16:50] <MauriceG> * going to check on mac
[04:17:08] <uGoMobi> agcolom: is that Safari on Mac OS?
[04:18:09] <MauriceG> agcolom: Yes, you're right.  On Mac it looks as you've shown.
[04:19:44] <agcolom> yes sorry was on the phone! yes it is safari for mac os
[04:27:58] <MauriceG> The input with is 50px. Too less on Mac. 65px looks ok. But on windows, a width of 65px looks ugly ...
[04:28:57] <MauriceG> agcolom: You can try in the webinspector console:  $( 'input' ).css ( 'width', '65px' );
[04:34:40] <uGoMobi> agcolom: MauriceG: do you find those arrows useful?
[04:36:27] <uGoMobi> .ui-slider-input::-webkit-inner-spin-button,
[04:36:27] <uGoMobi> .ui-slider-input::-webkit-outer-spin-button {
[04:36:27] <uGoMobi> 	-webkit-appearance: none;
[04:36:27] <uGoMobi> }
[04:37:19] <MauriceG> agcolom: no really, but the are there by default and john added some code to support them better now
[04:37:27] <MauriceG> no = not*
[04:37:41] <uGoMobi> not sure if it is bad practise to have the framework remove them
[04:37:53] <uGoMobi> that code ^^^ does
[04:38:34] <MauriceG> you will get them on date items also
[04:38:57] <uGoMobi> yeah, but then there is no slider handle already
[04:39:10] <uGoMobi> so that's different
[04:39:45] <uGoMobi> have to admit that when you just want to increase the number with one step the arrows might be handy

[04:40:11] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by John Bender (5d, 18h ago): bind to vmouseup for refresh Fixes #4756  Browsers like chrome provide an up and down arrow for range/number inputs but they don't fire the change even until the control is blurred. Here we bind to the mouseup and check if the value has been altered. If it has we refresh the slider position to reflect the value change.
[04:40:38] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yeah I know about that
[04:41:08] <uGoMobi> Opera adds those arrows as well, so it's not only webkit
[04:41:25] <uGoMobi> ok, forget about removing them
[04:42:15] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: can you do something? ( I don't have Mac here)
[04:42:27] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: sure
[04:43:33] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: can you try to solve that safari issue by adding padding or negative margin right or anything
[04:43:36] <uGoMobi> .ui-slider-input::-webkit-inner-spin-button, .ui-slider-input::-webkit-outer-spin-button {
[04:43:36] <uGoMobi> 	// rules
[04:43:36] <uGoMobi> }
[04:44:04] <uGoMobi> or just a margin-left
[04:46:17] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: ok
[04:46:56] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: hmm... on Chrome/Win it seems like you can't really style them :(
[04:47:13] <uGoMobi> margin or padding doesn't change anything
[04:48:25] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: yes, seems so.  I've tried some things already
[04:52:24] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yeah, can only make them disappear :(
[05:01:21] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: http://test.jqmobile.de/img/slidermacmargin0.png  :  .ui-slider-input::-webkit-inner-spin-button, .ui-slider-input::-webkit-outer-spin-button { margin: 0; }
[05:01:58] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: hehe, great!
[05:02:32] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Lunch time, sorry !
[05:06:08] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: we set a width of 50px for the input, maybe we should change to min-width
[05:27:27] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: back ...  This will make the input width = 100%  cause of ui-input-text rule
[05:27:55] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ah, I see
[05:29:09] <uGoMobi> thanks for trying
[06:03:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4790
[06:03:07] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4790 on jquery-mobile (slayergirl; 55m, 59s ago): popup: data-position-to orientation change not the right position
[06:03:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I know this is intentionally
[06:04:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was just wondering what is the difference between when the popup is first opened and when it is repositioned on resize
[06:06:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the reason is that the $(".selector") or given x,y coordinates could be out of view after resize, right?
[06:08:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: since that could also be the case when the popup is first opened there is already code that makes sure the popup is in view
[06:09:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: by "the reason" I meant the reason why the popup is always positioned to window after resize
[06:11:32] <agcolom> Hi again! Sorry had to go earlier...
[06:16:03] <MauriceG> Hi agcolom !  We've found out a tweak for the slider on mac.  But bigger values still look wonky
[06:19:35] <agcolom> ok!
[06:19:53] <MauriceG> agcolom: : http://test.jqmobile.de/img/slidermacmargin0.png
[06:20:17] <agcolom> Thanks :-) yes that's a bit better...
[06:20:57] <agcolom> I normally use FF so I thought I was missing something in my example until I tried it into both browsers and realised the difference!
[06:23:04] <MauriceG> agcolom: if the value gets over 999, Safari also adds a period as a thousand separator and only the half of the value is visible
[06:25:44] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: did you try "width: auto; min-width: 50px;" ?
[06:26:03] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: yes
[06:26:15] <MauriceG> result: no
[06:26:32] <uGoMobi> width doesn't increase?
[06:28:06] <MauriceG> the input gets too large. take the hole space in front of the slider
[06:29:31] <agcolom> input.ui-slider-input, .ui-field-contain input.ui-slider-input {
[06:29:31] <agcolom> width: 65px;
[06:29:43] <agcolom> sorry, pressed the wrong button!
[06:29:56] <agcolom> changing the width to 65px does the trick for me
[06:30:39] <agcolom> the up and down arrows are part of the width, hence the smaller input field
[06:31:15] <agcolom> uGoMobi: MauriceG ^
[06:31:57] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but how does that look on FF where there are not up/down arrows?
[06:32:14] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, would probably be too big ;-)
[06:32:17] <MauriceG> agcolom: yes, I mentioned above to use 65px, but this looks ugly on safari/chrom/ff on win. The item gets too big (but my just for my taste)
[06:33:07] <agcolom> I suppose we can leave as is, and then people can tweak themselves if they need to, it's not difficult...
[06:33:48] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: may just add the .ui-slider-input::-webkit-inner-spin-button, .ui-slider-input::-webkit-outer-spin-button { margin: 0; } rules ?
[06:34:13] <agcolom> is it possible to get rid of those up and down arrows?
[06:34:41] <MauriceG> agcolom: yeah, uGoMobi mentioned above
[06:36:02] <MauriceG> agcolom: .ui-slider-input::-webkit-inner-spin-button, .ui-slider-input::-webkit-outer-spin-button { -webkit-appearance: none; }  &copy; uGoMobi
[06:36:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, was thinking about that too, but might be a bit too agressive to have the framework remove them
[06:37:46] <MauriceG> and it seems just Safari/mac shows that issue
[06:37:53] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yes, let's add that margin 0 rule
[06:39:19] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: not sure yet if we have to set it for ::-webkit-inner-spin-button
[06:39:38] <uGoMobi> maybe only ::-webkit-outer-spin-button will do the trick
[06:39:42] <MauriceG> trying ...
[06:41:07] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: "width: auto; min-width: 50px;" is working on Safari/Win and Chrome/Win
[06:41:37] <uGoMobi> the width depends on the max value you set, which is good
[06:42:55] <agcolom> uGoMobi: doesn't seem to give good results on mac
[06:43:12] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: ::-webkit-outer-spin-button is enough
[06:43:17] <MauriceG> agcolom: yeah
[06:43:20] <agcolom> th einput field is too big and the slider and on a separate line
[06:43:23] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ok cool, less is more :)
[06:43:59] <uGoMobi> ah ok, so that's a specific Safari/Mac issue... weird
[06:45:51] <MauriceG> setting width: auto; min-width: 50px;  also needs another rule for mini.  but the items get too large - also on FF
[06:49:07] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I see, let's forget about that and only add .ui-slider-input::-webkit-outer-spin-button { margin: 0; }
[06:50:07] <uGoMobi> if you set a high value as max for the slider you might want to alter the width of the input with custom CSS anyway

[07:46:17] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4792 on jquery-mobile (jonathanfmuller; 22m, 45s ago): list divider (header) css margin-left not align with container collapsilble
[07:47:35] <toddparker> those arrows are just part of the browser's implementation of numeric inputs. they add a spinner.
[07:47:54] <toddparker> problem is they all do it differently - buttons inside, outside, etc.
[07:48:18] <toddparker> but if it doesn't break the layout, i'd rather let the native implementation do it's thing
[07:48:43] <toddparker> uGoMobi: -webkit-outer-spin-button = WAT?
[07:48:53] <toddparker> too many nusto webkit properties
[07:54:01] <toddparker> man, the Save button needs to be way mor obvious on jsbin

[08:22:10] <_|Nix|_> OK, so now we have two notifications ( jqmobilecommit /and/ socialhapy )?
[08:25:31] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender I cannot help but notice that on the buildbot running the tests prints out "Testing ?jquery=1.6.4" whereas on my machine it prints out "Testing kitchensink/" ...
[08:25:31] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[08:27:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What do you think about making popup position: fixed? I was gonna ask that from toddparker as well, but he's not around ...
[08:28:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it crossed my mind, but because of all those issues with toolbars and position fixed... :(
[08:29:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... I dunno if we wanna go into that ... lessee what toddparker thinks ... might be a TODO for > 1.2 ...
[08:29:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: transitions might become an issue too when the container is position fixed
[08:29:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I could set position: fixed after the transition completes.
[08:30:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I tried for the panel example
[08:30:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and?
[08:30:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that didn't work, but if it is added after the transition has completed it might work
[08:31:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: already saw a new issue with buttons underneath popup being triggered when clicking inside the popup
[08:31:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... change the coordinates to be window-relative and add position: fixed ...
[08:31:37] <uGoMobi> on Android of course
[08:31:41] <uGoMobi> :(
[08:31:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Crap ... I left the droid at work ...
[08:33:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you see my messages from a few hours ago ^^^ about the repositioning on resize?
[08:34:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I caught the end of that ...
[08:34:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: was just curious if the same logic that is used when the popup is first shown can be used when it is repositioned as well
[08:35:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That is already happening.
[08:36:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: When the orientationchange starts, the popup is quickly closed, and when the window size has stabilized, it is opened again, but without the transition(s).
[08:36:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, but it also always positioned to window
[08:37:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, right, sorry ... when it's re-opened it is positioned wrt. the window.
[08:37:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you already explained that we do this to make sure the popup is in view
[08:37:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[08:38:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, no. We could ensure the popup is in view by setting the focus on the container. The problem is that if I did that, the popup would be in view, but there would be too much jumping around.
[08:38:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and I have to set the focus on the container anyway, so if the container was off screen when I set the focus, it would jump on screen.
[08:38:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There's already enough jumping going on as it is.
[08:38:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, I see
[08:40:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but what I don't understand is that when I set position-to #myElement what is the difference between the when the popup is opened and when it is repositioned
[08:40:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that element could be out of view when you open the popup
[08:44:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you added some restrains that make sure the popup is in view when you open it. Could this logic be used for when the popup is repositioned as well?
[08:45:26] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!

[08:46:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's true. And when that's true, if you open a popup over an element that's out of view, it will jump to the popup because I focus the popup container when I open it.
[08:47:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do you want the same jumping to happen whenever you change the orientation as well? Isn't that too much jumping?
[08:54:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not really sure what I would prefer... less jumping or the same position-to being used. Most of all I wanted to understand the reason why because it wasn't fully clear to me. Now it is, thanks!

[09:29:10] <johnbender> lots of branch management but that's the scheme we've chosen

[09:38:34] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: fixed? for sure. i'm not crazy about the idea at all
[09:38:57] <toddparker> we should be working infixes and any small improvements for 1.2
[09:39:00] <toddparker> in master
[09:39:29] <toddparker> we can cherry pick fixes back for 1.1.2 if they make sense.
[09:40:46] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Are we gonna have a 1.1.2? In that case, I need to backport a nav fix ...
[09:43:43] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that's the idea
[09:43:55] <johnbender> that way if there's a fix we can put in 1.1-stable you don't have to cherry pick it twice
[09:43:57] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok clear, thanks again
[09:46:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi: toddparker: I made a few minor perf tweaks that amount to about a 15% performance improvment in the slider refresh
[09:46:35] <johnbender> I'm curious if you guys will notice a difference
[09:46:43] <johnbender> http://jsperf.com/jqm-slider-refresh-latest-slider-cleanup-branch
[09:46:46] <johnbender> perf from latest
[09:46:57] <johnbender> err
[09:47:05] <johnbender> that's the perf from slider cleanup
[09:47:12] <johnbender> http://jsperf.com/jqm-slider-refresh
[09:47:23] <johnbender> that's the perf from latest master
[09:47:47] <johnbender> I had to do it in two seperate tests because I didn't want to screw around with unloading and reloading the widget
[09:49:03] <johnbender> toddparker: uGoMobi: I think we could see a much larger speedup for the toggle switch
[09:49:11] <johnbender> but I haven't addressed that yet
[09:51:04] <uGoMobi> johnbender: cool, will try it out

[10:26:49] <gseguin> agcolom: are you referring to the guy complaining about $.support.touch being gone?
[10:27:06] <gseguin> uGoMobi: for the builder?
[10:27:35] <agcolom> gseguin: yes ;)
[10:27:51] <johnbender> gseguin: nevermind :D
[10:28:27] <gseguin> agcolom: I didn't feel like he was being rude, just pissed off
[10:28:36] <agcolom> I saw it when I got up this morning and it really annoyed me! No please, no thank you... really some people do not even have the basics in term of manners!
[10:29:14] <gseguin> I guess I didn't pay attention to it
[10:29:30] <agcolom> gseguin: yes, maybe I am being over sensitive... ;)
[10:29:44] <uGoMobi> gseguin: sorry, what for the builder?
[10:29:59] <gseguin> was your question builder related?
[10:30:19] <gseguin> uGoMobi: " gseguin: do I need to pick anything for 1.2 now 1.2a1 has been released?"
[10:30:48] <uGoMobi> gseguin: no, was not for the builder
[10:30:59] <uGoMobi> gseguin: johnbender already answered
[10:31:09] <gseguin> oh ok, sorry, I'm trying to catch up
[10:33:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Wow! On Chrome 21 it doesn't seem to make a difference!
[10:38:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ?
[10:38:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the perf?
[10:45:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah.
[10:45:55] <_|Nix|_> Do we have an agenda?
[10:50:25] <toddparker> i'll post up an agenda doc in a minute
[10:51:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well the perf tests show that there is a significant diff in performance, or at least in my testing
[10:51:10] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: did you look at the perf test or the slider
[10:53:21] <toddparker> agenda: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GyGY_53xxh8DTqk5iypusj80ZfCL6P1N7_DYIaQJ3yg/edit#
[10:54:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I opened the perf test in my Chrome and ran it twice. Unlike the other browsers, there's no clear before/after diff for my Chrome.
[10:55:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: did you open both of them? or just one?
[10:55:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: there are two separate tests, I didn't want to deal with loading and unloading different versions of the widget between runs
[10:55:55] <johnbender> that is two separate jsperf urls
[10:59:02] <toddparker> gseguin: why did you drop the support.touch?
[10:59:32] <toddparker> or we, rather
[10:59:59] <gseguin> well... because it was used only by touch.js
[11:00:19] <gseguin> and was creating a dependency on support.js
[11:00:26] <gseguin> which we didn't want
[11:01:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I opened this one: http://jsperf.com/jqm-slider-refresh-latest-slider-cleanup-branch
[11:04:52] <gseguin> meeting time?
[11:05:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the two tests there are the same test, you have to open the other url
[11:05:26] <johnbender> jsperf requires two test cases
[11:05:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the other url runs the same two tests for latest master
[11:06:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, then what are the two bars?
[11:07:26] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: http://jsperf.com/jqm-slider-refresh/2
[11:07:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: http://jsperf.com/jqm-slider-refresh-latest-slider-cleanup-branch/2
[11:07:37] <johnbender> that will make it clearer
[11:07:43] <johnbender> since I changed the second test to work with a toggle switch
[11:07:54] <johnbender> (working on that next or at some point)
[11:08:09] <toddparker> shoot
[11:08:13] <toddparker> starting now
[11:17:57] <johnbender> gseguin: ah we only used it in one place
[11:18:36] <johnbender> gseguin: I think we can just put it with a ||= in both places
[11:18:44] <johnbender> unless there's a timing issue
[11:23:21] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah I think there is a rather easy way to re-add it
[11:26:31] <johnbender> uGoMobi: is it a bug fix?
[11:26:42] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes
[11:26:51] <uGoMobi> johnbender: will paste the commit here

[11:30:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi: does this "unenhance the widget first?
[11:30:14] <johnbender> *"unenhance"
[11:30:17] <johnbender> or parts of it?
[11:30:48] <uGoMobi> johnbender: just parts of it... legend/heading and controls are both wrapped in a div
[11:31:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ahh I see what you're saying, move them to widget methods and use _on, I'm for it
[11:31:05] <uGoMobi> johnbender: what it does is unwrap if needed and then wrap again
[11:31:15] <johnbender> uGoMobi: kk, that sounds expensive
[11:31:29] <johnbender> can't we simply skip it?
[11:32:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: that may be very naive
[11:33:14] <uGoMobi> johnbender: it checks if those divs exists, if not unwrapping is skipped
[11:33:52] <uGoMobi> but there might be a less expensive way
[11:38:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'd have to look more thoroughly, I'm not concerned about correctness so that should be fine
[11:49:10] <johnbender> uGoMobi: MauriceG: seems fine to me if it works, just need some tests
[11:54:23] <uGoMobi> johnbender: Re controlgroup... sure, let me know if you want to discuss something
[11:56:31] <johnbender> uGoMobi: nope it's fine for now, we can put the perf stuff off until later
[11:58:00] <uGoMobi> johnbender: maybe we should make controlgroup more like a real widget so you can just call controlgroup("refresh")
[11:58:25] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I forgot that it isn't a widget
[11:58:27] <johnbender> ugh
[11:58:34] <johnbender> uGoMobi: we definitely should
[11:58:44] <uGoMobi> johnbender: that's the whole problem
[11:58:56] <johnbender> uGoMobi: blah
[11:59:00] <uGoMobi> only way to refresh a controlgroup is to call it again
[12:03:08] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well if you talk to him again apologize for me and let him know we could always use the help
[12:03:19] <johnbender> in fact I'm going to go send him a github message

[12:12:28] <johnbender> toddparker: hell yah
[12:12:34] <johnbender> extra help == awesome
[12:12:39] <uGoMobi> johnbender: you asked me to change event triggering for popup: this.element.trigger( “event” ) → this._trigger( “event” )
[12:12:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: correct, where did that fall out?
[12:12:54] <johnbender> well
[12:12:55] <uGoMobi> johnbender: when I do that it doesn't work anymore
[12:13:11] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it should be this.element( "widgetevent" ) -> this._trigger( "event" )
[12:13:15] <johnbender> important difference
[12:13:32] <johnbender> err
[12:13:54] <johnbender> this.element.trigger( "popupevent" ) would be this._trigger( "event" )
[12:14:25] <uGoMobi> aha

[12:28:21] <socialhapy> ★ Github API: no ref/branch found
[12:33:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I did something similar but I wanted to namespace the events, see $.proxyMany in core
[12:34:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I moved the handlers, but I'd really appreciate it if you could have a look at the change to make sure that I didn't accidentally introduce any bugs: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4795 fixed-toolbar unit tests passed for me in Chrome 20 and FF 12.
[12:34:22] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (3m, 8s ago): [fixedToolbar] Move page handlers to the widget prototype level and...
[12:34:22] <johnbender> wondering if I shouldn't push that back out
[12:34:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the unit tests are fairly worthless for that widget :(
[12:34:54] <_|Nix|_> Great ... :-S
[12:35:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah I need to move my slider refactor bindings back out to make sure they get unbound
[12:36:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm worried about the fact that the handlers use "this", which refers to the page that triggers the event. I'm hoping that using this.element.closest( ".ui-page" ) is fully equivalent, given that "this" will now refer to the widget itself.
[12:36:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I've already changed the slider in master to use ._on()
[12:36:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: No need for _destroy() anymore - except of course when we decide to implement the actual unenhancement.
[12:39:02] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: did you make those changes to slider?
[12:39:11] <johnbender> it's cuasing a massive issue in rebasing
[12:39:20] <johnbender> :(
[12:39:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Sorry!
[12:40:09] <johnbender> alright I have to go back and rework this
[12:40:13] * johnbender goes off to do a merge
[12:40:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: also we shouldn't be making those changes to master
[12:40:56] <johnbender> we're stable for the 1.2 release
[12:42:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: can you revert those and move them out to branch?
[12:42:54] <johnbender> leave the slider one's out
[12:43:00] <johnbender> I'll take care of those in my branch
[12:43:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: widget-on-refactor or something
[12:43:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK ...
[12:44:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm just worried that we'll end up with a branch-bloom now that master is in a code slush.
[12:44:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Should we designate master as, like, 1.2-stable? Although that'll result in a cherry-pick-orama ...
[12:45:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... although if I rename "fixed-toolbar-handlers" and build on that, I'll only have one branch ... but still ...
[12:47:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right, it's either that or cherry pick fixes possibly across three branches
[12:47:42] <_|Nix|_> So, basically, for 1.2 it looks like we brought in a brand new widget factory, but we've not made use of any of its new-fangled facilities, such as ._on() ...
[12:47:50] <johnbender> we've had this discussion before, and I'm in favor of branching for 1.3
[12:47:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: correct
[12:47:58] <johnbender> it was a late addition
[12:48:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Looks like ...
[12:48:34] <johnbender> I made an issue of said late addition as well, but it was worked out before apparently
[12:48:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If we branch for 1.3, we can cherry-pick these ._on()-fixes for 1.2.(>0)
[12:48:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: or 1.2 stable take your pick
[12:49:01] <johnbender> for a branch
[12:49:28] <johnbender> either way we should keep it to bug fixes for whichever branch is going ot be 1.2 final
[12:50:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: for now lets just do branches and if it's getting scary we'll talk to todd
[12:50:11] <johnbender> at this rate we should be at rc shortly
[12:50:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I take it the widget factory drop in shall be the branch-off point, eh?
[12:51:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah
[12:51:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Although gseguin's filter stuff landed later.
[12:51:35] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: also slated for 1.2
[12:51:37] <johnbender> late late stuff
[12:51:50] <johnbender> like retroactively retiring :(
[12:51:59] <johnbender> he worked it out with Todd
[12:52:29] <johnbender> but that's the last of that

[13:12:21] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Jasper de Groot (1m, 16s ago): Popup: use widget factory to trigger events
[13:14:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: 1000 thanks
[13:15:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP.
[13:18:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: one thing to be aware of with the unbinding
[13:18:25] <johnbender> well let me check
[13:19:04] <johnbender> nevermind
[13:19:31] <johnbender> I was worried it would detach all events but it must do some chicanery to make sure it only unbinds a single callback from the widget instance
[13:19:34] <johnbender> interesting
[13:22:14] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah yes, it creates a proxy
[13:22:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and uses a uuid to make sure the binding is widget-instance-specific.
[13:23:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ahh it adds a guid to the event binding name space?
[13:23:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yep.
[13:23:21] <johnbender> I guess that avoids the memory bloat of just using a new function and storing it
[13:23:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: this.eventNamespace = "." + this.widgetName + this.uuid;
[13:23:49] <johnbender> using namespacing was my original idea but generating unique identifiers for namespacing seemed a bit crazy for a one off
[13:24:03] <johnbender> yay for shared solutions
[13:24:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah. $.Widget is the right place for this.
[13:26:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm
[13:26:24] <johnbender> one _major_ downside here
[13:26:28] <johnbender> is the use of apply
[13:26:52] <johnbender> for performance sensitive applications this is a lot of extra overhead for the handler
[13:26:58] <johnbender> especially if it's being fired on something like mousemove
[13:27:04] <johnbender> or at least it looks like it might be
[13:29:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I dunno much about the overhead of .apply() but if you think so, you should take it up with the UI guys. How does $.proxy do it? It would have to also be using .apply or .call or something ...
[13:30:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: correct
[13:30:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, if those have too much overhead, then doing handlers via widget member functions is out of the questions.
[13:30:27] <johnbender> but that can be avoided
[13:31:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Can you test the slider performance before the addition of ._on() vs. after?
[13:32:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's hard for mousemove
[13:32:40] <johnbender> but I'm sure I could/should
[13:32:53] <johnbender> I'll play with it tomorrow
[13:32:58] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[13:33:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Maybe we can hook up to, like, pagebeforechange with and without ._on() and check the diff.
[13:33:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Then we can change pages like there's no tomorrow.
[13:34:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and measure the difference.
[13:38:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we could just do some arbitrary event too and trigger it I gues
[13:38:35] <johnbender> that's probably what I'll do
[13:42:03] <johnbender> remove the overhead of anything else to get a sense for it
[13:42:10] <johnbender> and then introduce the overhead to see whether it matters
[13:42:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the callback we have bound to the mousemove is _exceptionally_ simple
[13:42:44] <johnbender> all assignment, object property access, and guards
[13:42:49] <johnbender> which means it's fast
[13:42:54] <johnbender> oops
[13:43:01] <johnbender> spoke too soon
[13:43:05] <johnbender> there's a refresh call in there
[13:43:10] <johnbender> it may not matter much at all :D
