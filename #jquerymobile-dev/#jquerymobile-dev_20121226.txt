[07:00:03] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz toddmparker_ 
[07:00:26] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker_ uGoMobi:
[07:00:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: looked like you got a bunch done on the sliders yesterday
[07:01:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, not sure if I am happy wit it though
[07:02:15] <uGoMobi> had to wrap slider in another div to get styling done
[07:02:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ahh bummer
[07:02:54] <arschmitz> not sure if you saw the commit but i fixed the issue you noticed in ie7 though it was actually all browswers 
[07:03:05] <uGoMobi> and to be honest I still find it looking a bit strange with inputs above slider
[07:03:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw your fix.. nice
[07:03:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I noticed later it was on all browsers
[07:03:50] <arschmitz> not sure how we didnt notice before it was all browswers and should have been doing it essentially the whole time not something new
[07:03:51] <uGoMobi> I thought you would find out
[07:04:25] <uGoMobi> happens when you work long on something
[07:04:39] <uGoMobi> you miss the basic things cos you focus on details
[07:04:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah super simple fix though just a miss placed if
[07:05:01] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[07:06:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what do you think about the inputs above the slider?
[07:06:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im looking right now trying to decide lol
[07:07:02] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:07:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: as long as there is a label i like it above
[07:07:20] <uGoMobi> I don't know a good alternative but it looks so messy
[07:07:35] <arschmitz> but when i look at the ones with out the label i dont like it 
[07:08:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also looks like in a fieldcontain with a label at wide widths the slider is flush to the bottom of the inputs not centered 
[07:09:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you pull the commit I just pushed 10 mins ago?
[07:09:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no sorry i missed that i was looking at the branch preview hold on ill pull the commit 
[07:10:13] <uGoMobi> was typical case of fixing something in one browser and break the other browsers
[07:10:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: always the way
[07:11:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah its fixed with that commit
[07:11:08] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:11:50] <arschmitz> i think i dont like the inputs above when there is no label because they lose context to the slider in a way it seems 
[07:11:52] <uGoMobi> in general i want to get rid of different top/bottom margin for ui-mini
[07:12:07] <uGoMobi> for all form widgets, collapsibles, etc
[07:12:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that would be nice
[07:12:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I agree that one looks bad
[07:12:40] <arschmitz> as long as the label is there though i like it above
[07:12:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think better to wait with that for 1.4
[07:13:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will give it another look
[07:13:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for the margins you mean because for that for sure
[07:13:26] <uGoMobi> I have to go soon (still Xmas here)
[07:13:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[07:13:46] <uGoMobi> will give it a look again later and we can discuss
[07:13:50] <arschmitz> oh do you celebrate for two days there or just on the 26th?
[07:13:55] <uGoMobi> also like to hear toddmparker_ opinion
[07:14:05] <uGoMobi> two days 25 and 26
[07:14:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool i didnt know that though i knew it was a big deal there
[07:14:52] <uGoMobi> another dinner to go :D
[07:14:58] <arschmitz> suposed to be the original home of st nick right?
[07:14:58] <uGoMobi> talk to you tomorrow
[07:15:04] <arschmitz> bye have fun
[07:15:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I dunno
[07:15:12] <uGoMobi> thanks
[07:15:18] <uGoMobi> later
[07:15:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:bye
[10:39:13] <toddmparker_> hey guys, catching up
[10:40:25] <toddmparker_> do you have a link for the slider you want me to weigh in on?
[11:07:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/range/docs/demos/sliders/sliders.html
[11:07:41] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: make the screen narrow so the sliders all go on their own line. 
[11:08:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: the question is how do you think it looks for the regular slider with the input above the slider
[11:09:37] <toddmparker_> it is always going to be a bit awkward
[11:10:08] <toddmparker_> I dunno
[11:10:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah and i like it when there is a label but on the examples without a label it looks a little weird but i dont think there is any better option
[11:10:36] <toddmparker_> it's nice to have, but i'm guessing a lot of people may not want that
[11:10:50] <toddmparker_> yeah, w/o a label, it's really odd
[11:11:06] <toddmparker_> are you and uGoMobi leaning towards not including?
[11:11:36] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: no i dont think so and if people dont want it at all its as easy as setting display:none
[11:12:42] <toddmparker_> so include but show how to hide?
[11:13:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: i think for consistancy and usability it needs to be the way it is just dont entirely like how it looks in all situations but oh well cant make everything perfect in all situations
[11:13:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yes thats my oppinion anyway
[11:14:05] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: would work well with the examples of using the labels on hover or in the handles like _|Nix|_ has
[11:14:11] <toddmparker_> i still wonder if having the option to style the inputs to look like feedback would be useful. certaily better than hiding
[11:14:50] <toddmparker_> like, remove the input box, make text bold
[11:15:07] <toddmparker_> technically yo u could still tap on them and they'd be editable
[11:15:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: ah yeah thats a good idea too
[11:15:38] <toddmparker_> we've done that for client projects
[11:15:41] <arschmitz> easily done in a demo with out an option 
[11:15:48] <toddmparker_> pretty easy to style 'em that way
[11:15:52] <toddmparker_> right
[11:16:10] <arschmitz> yeah i think sliders could use a lot of demos to show different possibilities 
[11:16:10] <toddmparker_> you can get rid of the spinner arrows with a webkit css property
[11:16:15] <toddmparker_> yeah
[11:17:31] <toddmparker_> grabbing lunch...
[11:18:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker_:me too actually lol
[11:18:14] <arschmitz> so we can talk more later
[11:43:27] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:43:31] <toddmparker_> i'm back
[12:56:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker_:me too
[13:31:34] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: i know this is a bit odd but i found a problem with checkboxes in your slide-panel-refactor branch
[13:32:54] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: any checkbox that is not contained within a label does not respond http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel-refactor/docs/forms/checkboxes/
[13:36:31] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: Nevermind i found the problem its fixed in master once you merge it will fix itself
[15:34:00] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: whew
