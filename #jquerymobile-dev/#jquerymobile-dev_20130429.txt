[00:52:44] <uGoMobi> morning frequent 
[00:53:27] <frequent> my PR is still not passing in Travis but on my local machine all tests are passing.
[00:53:52] <frequent> #5932
[00:54:35] <frequent> and I added the resetting function so toggle once (sets - hide or show), toggle again resets to CSS hide/show only
[00:56:05] <uGoMobi> frequent: our navigation tests fail randomly, don't think it has anything to do with your changes
[00:56:38] <uGoMobi> sequence tests are still causing problem on Travis and Jenkins
[00:58:36] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. Btw, whats the difference between Travis and Jenkins?
[01:00:44] <uGoMobi> frequent: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3231532
[01:00:52] <uGoMobi> there you see some differences

[01:06:16] <uGoMobi> frequent: that seems like the opposite of what is was before
[01:06:38] <frequent> 1sec
[01:07:19] <frequent> ahm. correct. Let me check, what I did
[01:09:23] <uGoMobi> frequent: maybe I missed something, but if what we test didn't change the result probably shouldn't change either
[01:10:33] <frequent> true. Must have mixed up something. Let me re-check and fix.
[01:10:34] <uGoMobi> frequent: BTW - it's better to do library and tests changes in separate commits
[01:10:44] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok
[01:10:46] <frequent> ok.

[02:54:36] <_|Nix|_> Yaaay! babulina.go-nix.ca is back in business with a new USB SATA controller!
[03:17:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[03:17:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hey! good morning
[03:17:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is the active state becoming themeable?
[03:17:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[03:18:00] <uGoMobi> uhh... afternoon
[03:18:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, it already is
[03:18:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but in the temporary default theme in "next" all swatches still use the same style
[03:18:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. Then we need to add selectors for .ui-slider-label-a.ui-btn-active ...
[03:19:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can I tack that onto .ui-btn-a.ui-btn-active with ","?
[03:19:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's one solution, yes
[03:19:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the other is to give the label class .ui-btn
[03:20:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and unset ui-btn styles it shouldn't get
[03:20:40] <_|Nix|_> Not bad ... that'll reduce classes.
[03:20:54] <_|Nix|_> We can prefix with .ui-slider-label to distinguish from other buttons.
[03:21:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think in general it's better to prevent using widget specific stuff in theme.css
[03:21:25] <_|Nix|_> Like .ui-slider-label.ui-btn.ui-btn-a.ui-btn-active?
[03:21:56] <_|Nix|_> So, we could get rid of ui-slider-label-*
[03:22:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you mean as selector in slider.css to override some default .ui-btn rules?
[03:23:09] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[03:23:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, that's good
[03:23:34] <_|Nix|_> The thing is, it sounds like .ui-btn-* is basically becoming the carrier of theme information.
[03:23:53] <_|Nix|_> So, we should probably call it .ui-theme-* or something, because it's not just for buttons.
[03:23:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I would have to look at the flip toggle generated markup but we might be abble to reduce the classes we add
[03:24:52] <_|Nix|_> ... but let's hold of on that for now, I guess, until you've studied the theme inheritance possibilities.
[03:25:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, we might end up using a generic theme class
[03:26:01] <_|Nix|_> Oh, wait - ui-slider-label-a refers to the side of the slider, not the theme :)
[03:27:11] <_|Nix|_> So, basically the right hand side of the switch has ui-body-a, but the left hand side has no ui-bod-* class.
[03:28:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, I just looked at the generated markup
[03:29:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm, so we have one span with .ui-btn-a and the other with .ui-body-a
[03:29:41] <_|Nix|_> We have one span with .ui-btn-active, not .ui-btn-a, right?
[03:30:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well now that active state is themeable it need a ui-btn- theme class
[03:30:24] <_|Nix|_> We probably need to add .ui-btn-a in addition to .ui-btn-active ...
[03:30:30] <uGoMobi> right
[03:30:40] <uGoMobi> pfff lot of classes there :(

[03:31:15] <_|Nix|_> What's the downside of adding .ui-body-a.ui-btn-active in the theme CSS? Is that also widget-specific?
[03:31:54] <_|Nix|_> It's also bad that the .ui-slider also has to have .ui-body-a ...
[03:31:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, lot of overhead to just add that for flip toggle
[03:32:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[03:32:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ui-btn-a comes after ui-body-a in the CSS so we don't need to remove ui-body-a I think
[03:33:01] <uGoMobi> just add ui-btn-a and ui-btn-active
[03:34:38] <_|Nix|_> Yep. Done.
[03:34:52] <_|Nix|_> -                               sliderTheme = !i ? " ui-body-" + trackTheme : ( " " + $.mobile.activeBtnClass );
[03:34:55] <_|Nix|_> +                               sliderTheme = !i ? " ui-body-" + trackTheme : ( " ui-btn-" + trackTheme + " " + $.mobile.activeBtnClass );
[03:35:02] <_|Nix|_> That's what I did.
[03:35:50] <_|Nix|_> The thing is that now the edge of the active class is visible above and below the button, so we may have to reduce the clearance around the button.
[03:35:57] <_|Nix|_> I'll push this so you can see for yourself.
[03:36:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, will take a look at that

[03:37:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: using ui-body-x for the slider track is also just a temporary solution
[03:37:12] <uGoMobi> this was ui-btn-down-x
[03:37:28] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I remember.
[03:38:24] <uGoMobi> we probably have to add a class for the slider track, read-only lists, count bubbles, etc. that used a btn class of a specific state
[03:38:47] <_|Nix|_> Oy ... that's a lot of classes!
[03:39:43] <uGoMobi> I mean one class for all of them for each theme swatch
[03:40:12] <uGoMobi> something like ui-contrast-a instead of ui-body-a
[03:41:48] <_|Nix|_> Aaah, that's not so bad.
[03:47:51] <_|Nix|_> Well, master kinda has the same problem in terms of the active element showing up behind the button, but since it's circular it's not so obvious.
[03:53:00] <_|Nix|_> OK ... weird ... demos/widgets/fixed-toolbars/ ... why do we have links to slashdot and intel? I probably added those ... :)
[03:53:56] <_|Nix|_> *clunk* ... that's the weirdest thing ever ...
[03:55:42] <_|Nix|_> OK ... they're gone from master ...
[03:56:19] <uGoMobi> lol
[04:00:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, slider needs the same trick for the fill background ...
[04:01:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for the highlight?
[04:01:39] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[04:03:47] <_|Nix|_> ... and I think the mini button needs one more pixel of width/height.

[04:05:09] <_|Nix|_> ... although it may be more a question of the top being incorrect. It seems like it needs to go down by one pixel.
[04:05:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: could be because of we removed ui-btn-inner and its 1px border top (highlight)
[04:06:47] <_|Nix|_> Could be ... however, it's weird ... the top is 50%, so it's not like I can subtract a pixel from that.
[04:07:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the negative marging top to center the button could be reduced by 1px
[04:07:47] <uGoMobi> not sure, just guessing
[04:08:24] <uGoMobi> not reduced, increased by 1px actually
[04:08:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... that might be the way to go.
[04:08:59] <uGoMobi> the negative margin should be exactly half the height of the button including border
[04:10:02] <_|Nix|_> Yep. /Now/ it's exactly half the height. But I guess it was including that border before.

[04:13:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the fact that the flip toggle container and handle get different corner radii isn't helping either
[04:14:09] <_|Nix|_> Probably not :)
[04:14:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: those should get the same radius like before
[04:15:26] <_|Nix|_> ... and the label vs. the container ... I think those are different too ...
[04:15:54] <_|Nix|_> I think the label and the button have the same radius whereas the container has a smaller radius.
[04:17:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think both labels get different radius because one is btn and other body
[04:18:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: adding some border-radius inherit rules that override the (.ui-btn).ui-corner-all rules in theme.css is probably the way to go here
[04:18:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, it's 0.6em for both, but the font size may be different ...
[04:18:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah I see
[04:18:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's what seems to be happening at least.
[04:19:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe the font size isn't being passed along properly.
[04:19:48] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... the span's font size is 14px, whereas the container's font size is 13px.
[04:20:45] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... so which font size is correct ... ? *scratch head*
[04:22:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm, they all have font-size 16px and the same border-radius (I am not looking at the mini sized flip toggle)
[04:22:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then it's just because the different height
[04:23:57] <_|Nix|_> Yep. mini is being applied differently at different levels.
[04:24:56] <_|Nix|_> So, I'm wondering. If we were to set the border-radius to inherit, would it inherit the specified value or the computed value?
[04:25:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the specified value
[04:26:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see we still have some ui-btn-inner rules in slider.css
[04:27:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I can clean that up and look into border-radius
[04:27:15] <_|Nix|_> ... no help there ...
[04:27:21] <_|Nix|_> Great!
[04:27:28] <_|Nix|_> You're the expert ...
[04:28:03] <_|Nix|_> I guess those .ui-btn-inner rules needed to get applied, but the corresponding div is now gone ...
[04:28:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let's not forget to check slider tooltip
[04:28:56] <_|Nix|_> Showing the value on the button no longer works. It's probably looking for ui-btn-text ...
[04:29:19] <_|Nix|_> The tooltip looks OK. I mean, it works correctly. As far as aesthetics, well, you know me ...
[04:30:08] <uGoMobi> :)
[04:32:59] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, the value does not show up in the button, because it expects .ui-btn-text to be present.
[04:33:07] <_|Nix|_> I need to fix that.
[04:40:46] <_|Nix|_> OK ... fixed, however, now the text doesn't show up in the middle of the button ...

[04:42:23] <_|Nix|_> Wow! mini fails miserably ...
[04:42:59] <_|Nix|_> I think I will not write the value to the button if mini is set ... that's useless ...
[04:54:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is using line-height kosher with CSS?
[04:54:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's the only way I can think of centering the text in the slider button ...
[04:55:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but what if people want the text to wrap?
[04:56:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We're talking the value of the slider ... wrap?
[04:56:34] <_|Nix|_> Like <========[ 50 ]=========>
[04:56:41] <_|Nix|_> Instead of the usual [ ]
[04:57:02] <_|Nix|_> Can that wrap? It's not even multiple words ...
[04:57:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh sorry... was thinking about pointy popup 
[04:57:16] <_|Nix|_> Nono ... no worries there.
[04:57:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, we might have to edit TR to allow users to specify the size of the arrow.
[04:57:44] <_|Nix|_> That's a different story.
[04:57:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: wow
[04:57:48] <uGoMobi> :)
[04:58:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For sure - it's another degree of freedom, right?
[04:58:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think using line-height is ok in this case

[05:43:59] <uGoMobi> crazy bot
[05:44:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sure, make it on master and then we merge again
[05:44:21] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[05:45:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: didn't we do something similar for dialogs?
[05:45:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I mean when we encounter a link with rel="dialog"
[05:46:01] <_|Nix|_> Nono ... I think nav handles all that.
[05:46:05] <_|Nix|_> ... unfortunately.
[05:46:07] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[05:46:17] <_|Nix|_> We should really have a plugin system for that.
[05:46:51] <uGoMobi> yeah, panels should use that too
[05:47:05] <_|Nix|_> ... not that easy, to move the popup stuff out of link, actually ... the popup uses a default enhancer, but adding this stuff would make it non-default.
[05:47:24] <_|Nix|_> So, I need a way to retrieve the default enhancer ... :)
[05:47:44] <_|Nix|_> ... or I can add a second enhancer for popup links ...
[05:47:59] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... that's what I'll do ...
[05:50:00] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... but this will increase startup time, because for every page we have to run .find( "a" ).jqmEnhanceable() twice ...
[05:50:12] <_|Nix|_> Once for links, and once for popup.
[05:50:37] <_|Nix|_> So, I think I'll leave master as is, and I'll move it only when we're about to remove jquery.mobile.links.js ...
[05:50:59] <_|Nix|_> So, not only when it's deprecated, but when we actually remove it from the code.
[05:51:16] <_|Nix|_> I'll make a devtask.

[05:54:48] <_|Nix|_> There ...
[05:55:11] <_|Nix|_> So, wait ... when you add the selectors to theme.css, the code in js/jquery.mobile.links.js will be useless?
[05:55:33] <_|Nix|_> Like, it will add .ui-link, even though .ui-link doesn't do anything anymore?
[06:05:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it is useless, but I will leave .ui-link in the theme.css for 1.4
[06:06:32] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[06:08:19] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender Are there many places where we convert what we know to be an id to an href (such as when we assign the href of the custom select button and subsequently click it in order to display either a popup or a dialog)? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5893 brings to light the fact that whenever we use what we know to be an id as an href, we need to escape the weird characters that it may contain.
[06:08:20] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: I’ll tell johnbender about that.
[06:10:07] <sygram> Hi to all
[06:10:39] <sygram> can any developer elaborate on issue http://forum.jquery.com/topic/form-post-and-browser-refresh#14737000004097279
[06:11:21] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender In fact, it may not even be our using it as an href that forces us to escape those characters, but our using it as a constructor for a jQuery object. So, if we have <div id="a.b"></div> and we are given an href #a.b then we cannot use that href in a jQuery constructor as is, because jQuery will treat .b as a class selector.
[06:11:21] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: I’ll tell johnbender about that.
[06:12:01] <uGoMobi> ok, have to go for few hours... be back later
[06:13:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: K L8R
[06:14:18] <sygram> why jquerymobile does not repost data on refresh but when if i don't use jquerymobile the browser does ?
[06:15:50] <_|Nix|_> sygram: ... because jQM will post your data via AJAX.
[06:16:06] <sygram> i have set not to use ajax though
[06:16:56] <sygram> globally and via data-ajax="false"
[06:17:16] <_|Nix|_> sygram: Can you create an example with our template? http://jsbin.com/irenuk/1/edit
[06:17:47] <_|Nix|_> sygram: ... and an issue citing the example? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/
[06:18:54] <sygram> ok thanks, i will try to generate my issue there
[06:18:58] <sygram> thank you very much
[06:19:03] <_|Nix|_> sygram: Awesome!
[06:20:47] <sygram> one parameter though, all mobile browsers that i used repost the data. Desktop Firefox and opera do not. I will explain in ticket . thx
[06:21:33] <_|Nix|_> sygram: Yes, please list the behaviour you see for each browser you test.
[06:38:03] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ping
[06:38:22] <agcolom> oops sorry, just saw you're out for a few hours. 
[06:38:52] <agcolom> ?tell uGoMobi the picture here is missing: http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/examples/panels/panel-styling.html#demo-page
[06:38:52] <b-ot> agcolom: I’ll tell uGoMobi about that.
[08:16:39] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes that's an issue
[08:16:39] <b-ot> johnbender: You have 2 new messages, use `read when you wish to read them.
[08:16:44] <johnbender> `read
[08:16:44] <b-ot> johnbender: From _|Nix|_, 2h 8m ago: Are there many places where we convert what we know to be an id to an href (such as when we assign the href of the custom select button and subsequently click it in order to display either a popup or a dialog)? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5893 brings to light the fact that whenever we use what we know to be an id as an href, we need to escape the weird characters that it may contain.
[08:16:49] <b-ot> johnbender: From _|Nix|_, 2h 5m ago: In fact, it may not even be our using it as an href that forces us to escape those characters, but our using it as a constructor for a jQuery object. So, if we have <div id="a.b"></div> and we are given an href #a.b then we cannot use that href in a jQuery constructor as is, because jQuery will treat .b as a class selector.
[08:17:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: in at least one place
[08:17:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we switched the initial page selection to getElementById because IDs permit much more than is possible in the jQuery syntax
[08:59:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I know, all JPG images are broken in 1.3.1/dist/demos/
[08:59:13] <b-ot> uGoMobi: You have 1 new message, use `read when you wish to read it.

[09:51:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Aha ... gotta remember that trick ...
[09:52:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I tried to create a multipage document where the second page was linked from the first and had an id with a period in it, and it worked.

[11:25:48] <toddmparker> Hi all
[11:25:54] <toddmparker> just caught up
[11:26:08] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: for the flip switch, I wonder if we want to re-think that anyway
[11:26:31] <toddmparker> it's based on slider for the drag effect, but it seems really complex
[11:26:31] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker 
[11:26:39] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi 
[11:27:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, it is kinda complex
[11:27:22] <toddmparker> I do agree that a hi-inset-a or whatever would be good to have for the slider track, off flip switch, etc
[11:27:29] <uGoMobi> toddmparker:  not sure if splitting up slider and flip toggle should be something for 1.4 or 1.5
[11:27:53] <toddmparker> yeah, just wanted to throw that out there if it was causing a lot of trouble
[11:28:14] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes I understand
[11:28:25] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: it's not big trouble to get them back in shape
[11:28:45] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: not sure how much work it is to make it a new widget
[11:46:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: iv been thinking about looking at re-writing slider
[11:46:29] <arschmitz> if i do we should split out flip switch i think
[11:47:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes, we are going to work on improving the slider it's good moment to make flip switch a different widget
[11:48:13] <uGoMobi> s/we/when we/
[11:48:54] <uGoMobi> maybe we have to discuss priorities this weeks meeting
[11:49:10] <arschmitz> yeah
[11:49:23] <arschmitz> its probably better for 1.5 but we will see
[11:49:35] <uGoMobi> we have the table widget, listview filter extension, navbar, panel, etc.
[11:50:38] <uGoMobi> lot of work and we already decided that we can't wait with 1.4 release until we have done everything we have in mind
[11:51:11] <arschmitz> yup
[11:52:55] <toddmparker> for 1.4, be good to see if we can at least speed up slider responsiveness
[11:53:03] <toddmparker> does feel slow as you drag
[11:53:07] <toddmparker> esp. on android
[11:53:08] <uGoMobi> true
[11:53:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah thing is i dont think there is an easy fix there
[11:53:56] <arschmitz> i think its fundamental to the way the current slider is written
[11:53:56] <toddmparker> I was afraid you'd say that :)
[11:54:40] <arschmitz> iv been wondering if it might be easier to look at the other range slider i wrote for inspiration on the re write
[11:54:50] <arschmitz> it has a lot more features and a lot less code
[11:55:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: what do you think?
[11:57:23] <uGoMobi> for the slider we might want to look at how others do it... I've seen comments that there are much better performing sliders out there
[11:57:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah im not talking about the jqm range slider
[11:58:01] <arschmitz> this is something else all together
[11:59:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but do you mean the rangeslider or the slider? or both?
[11:59:19] <arschmitz> both
[11:59:21] <uGoMobi> aha
[11:59:31] <arschmitz> the one im talking about is both
[12:00:21] <arschmitz> but is about half the lines of code with way more features and better perfromance ( at least it seems its hard to test "responsiveness" in a meaningful way)

[14:13:04] <toddmparker> arschmitz and uGoMobi - re: slider, the ultimate solution may be to use UI's with the pointer events/hand.js
[14:13:35] <toddmparker> but if not, what you did earlier would be a great start for a re-write
[14:13:51] <toddmparker> stuff to think about for 1.5
[14:14:04] <toddmparker> even the new slider can be laggy, dunno why
[14:15:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: good idea to look into UI's
[14:16:03] <uGoMobi> what do you think arschmitz ? you are slider specialist :)
[14:21:59] <toddmparker> take UI's hack in the pointer stuff and see what happens
