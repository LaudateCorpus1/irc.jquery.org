[09:11:41] <gseguin> good morning
[09:30:49] <todd_> morning!
[09:30:58] <todd_> blog post just went up
[09:30:58] <todd_> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/07/08/jquery-mobile-team-update-week-of-july-4th/
[09:34:36] <todd_> hey _nickel
[09:34:58] <todd_> would you have some time next week to help us with some unit tests for new features?
[09:35:15] <_nickel> possibly, what are you working on?
[09:35:23] <_nickel> I thought we were feature freezing until 1.0
[09:35:57] <_nickel> that is, I'd be glad to if I can find the time
[10:00:07] <todd_> we're adding smaller things like the DOM size mgmt, auto-init widtgets, etc
[10:00:11] <todd_> plumbing stuff
[10:00:16] <todd_> not new widgets or anything
[10:00:28] <todd_> scott has like 5 branches that are very close, but need unit test help
[10:00:38] <todd_> that's where you could be a huge help
[10:00:55] <todd_> we'd like to land a few branches next week since beta 2 will be in 2 weeks
[10:01:34] <todd_> hey miketaylr - question for you
[10:01:51] <todd_> been testing gseguin's transitions branch
[10:02:16] <gseguin> how's that going?
[10:02:26] <todd_> and the css transitions seem to really bog down opera mobile. seem on both the emulator and Android 2.2 device
[10:02:33] <todd_> good. i just email you results so far
[10:03:12] <gseguin> oh regarding email,  can you use my gmail address
[10:03:18] <todd_> sure
[10:03:31] <miketaylr> todd_: hmm bogus. i filed a bug for the site compat team to check it out...
[10:03:33] <gseguin> more convenient for outside work hours comms
[10:03:34] <todd_> forwarded
[10:03:46] <gseguin> great thanks
[10:04:11] <todd_> yeah, it's odd miketaylr - the latest versions of mobile seem to hang like crazy
[10:04:27] <todd_> the bg color seems to be breaking out of rounded corners too
[10:04:32] <todd_> boo
[10:04:33] <miketaylr> you're on 11.1?
[10:04:38] <todd_> yup
[10:04:42] <miketaylr> arf
[10:04:57] <todd_> 11.10.ADR-1107051709
[10:05:07] <todd_> just got it today from the android market
[10:05:10] <todd_> tested on 2.2
[10:05:17] <miketaylr> ok, noted. i'll take a look as well.
[10:05:28] <todd_> seem the same on the emulator, just downloaded it for mac
[10:05:32] <todd_> ok, cool
[10:05:41] <miketaylr> transitions or transitions-2?
[10:05:43] <todd_> i'd like to have another set of eyes on it
[10:05:55] <todd_> err - 2
[10:06:00] <miketaylr> :)
[10:06:27] <todd_> yep. it's got ghlsain's name on it, right?
[10:06:32] <todd_>  we need to toss that old branch
[10:07:09] <todd_> ghislain, geez can't spell today
[10:07:10] <gseguin> transitions is the right branch
[10:07:21] <todd_> it shows up as transitions-2
[10:07:30] <miketaylr> i see both branches
[10:07:37] <todd_> there is an old branch with the name from jesse
[10:07:38] <gseguin> -2 does not have the revert to OTransitionEnd
[10:07:44] <todd_> no?
[10:07:56] <todd_> confused then
[10:08:13] <todd_> transitions was last modified jan 26 by jesse streb
[10:08:19] <todd_> that was what i was testing
[10:08:21] <miketaylr> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/transitions
[10:08:24] <todd_> -2, that is
[10:08:48] <todd_> the git mac app is confused
[10:09:38] <gseguin> transitions is where I've been pushing
[10:09:45] <gseguin> no idea what -2 is
[10:10:12] <miketaylr> last commit on transitions-2 is from you, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/225c00c82126fcfac53c920eed00008a8d137ab8
[10:11:11] <gseguin> miketaylr: I saw that
[10:11:44] <gseguin> but I think that's because someone branched off after that commit
[10:11:52] <miketaylr> oh ok
[10:11:59] <gseguin> I've been pushing to transitions
[10:12:02] <miketaylr> dvcs is hard. let's go shopping.
[10:12:12] <gseguin> :)
[10:12:40] <gseguin> if you look at the network view, I can't actually see transitions-2
[10:13:59] <miketaylr> yeah, me neither
[10:14:39] <gseguin> todd_: what do you mean by beta flag?
[10:15:12] <todd_> i think - 2 is an artifact. that can be deleted
[10:15:31] <todd_> i was seeing that over the next page i navigated to briefly
[10:15:35] <todd_> let me re-test
[10:17:11] <todd_> i just cleaned up my branches and re-tested the transition branch, still seeing the hangups in opera mobile
[10:17:21] <todd_> gseguin - did you see that too?
[10:17:43] <todd_> so miketaylr - are you in testing?
[10:17:48] <gseguin> yeah yeah, that's what miketaylr filed a bug about
[10:18:06] <gseguin> I isolated just slide in a jsbin to show him
[10:18:13] <miketaylr> ah ok, so same issue then
[10:18:32] <gseguin> I think so
[10:18:45] <todd_> ok, i thought it was just blinky
[10:18:53] <todd_> this is stone cold hanging
[10:19:05] <miketaylr> let me clone this branch
[10:19:07] <todd_> pop and fade are better than the slides
[10:19:17] <todd_> they only hang briefly
[10:19:37] <todd_> miketaylr - is the rounded corner issue a known bug?
[10:19:46] <miketaylr> i thought that was recently fixee
[10:19:47] <miketaylr> dd
[10:19:53] <gseguin> oh yeah I wanted to ask you about that
[10:20:48] <todd_> looks just like IE9 - the bg color busts out of the rounded corner
[10:21:22] <miketaylr> that used to happen in desktop too
[10:21:34] <miketaylr> but it's fixed in desktop now
[10:21:46] <todd_> hmmm
[10:21:50] <miketaylr> slow internet is slow...
[10:22:00] <todd_> i just fired up my older opera mobile emulator - 10.1
[10:22:09] <todd_> and the corners look ok in that version
[10:22:14] <miketaylr> wat
[10:22:17] <miketaylr> hmm
[10:22:32] <todd_> fun
[10:22:42] <miketaylr> lousy free software
[10:22:46] <gseguin> :)
[10:23:08] <miketaylr> man, jquery mobile is a hefty lil' repo
[10:23:20] <todd_> yeah, sorry about that
[10:23:25] * miketaylr regrets not just checking out the branch
[10:23:29] <miketaylr> ah, no big deal
[10:23:40] <todd_> i think we have some cleanup to do
[10:23:54] <_nickel> todd_: so for testing, maybe I can plan to talk with Scott on Tuesday during the meeting about it?
[10:23:59] <_nickel> just need to make sure I'm there
[10:24:32] <gseguin> _nickel: meetings are on Thursdays now
[10:24:41] <_nickel> gseguin: so out of the loop
[10:25:00] <_nickel> todd_: gseguin: maybe I can chat with him on Monday morning about the tests then
[10:25:04] <_nickel> ?
[10:25:23] <todd_> yeah, monday would be good
[10:25:33] <todd_> meeting is thursday at 2:00 now
[10:25:59] <todd_> gotta get you back in, the 25th is coming up soon
[10:26:31] <gseguin> _nickel: read 11am PDT
[10:26:39] <todd_> yeah, taht
[10:26:57] <_nickel> todd_: indeed, I'd certainly like to hit the ground running :D
[10:27:09] <miketaylr> gotta run to a meeting, bbiab
[10:28:12] <todd_> miketaylr - screenshot of 10.1 vs. 11.1
[10:28:12] <todd_> http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=103aaug&s=7
[10:28:17] <todd_> rounded corner issue
[10:28:22] <todd_> evidence!
[10:28:27] <gseguin> todd_: do you have an iPad handy?
[10:29:04] <gseguin> I'm WFH and ours is in the office :(
[10:30:49] <todd_> yep
[10:31:29] <gseguin> could you browse to http://jsbin.com/izusel/#page2
[10:31:40] <gseguin> then bookmark this page to homescreen
[10:32:03] <gseguin> then open the bookmark and check your console to see how many pageshow you got
[10:34:09] <todd_> looks like just 1
[10:34:31] <todd_> ios 3.2
[10:34:39] <todd_> i can check 4 if you need me to
[10:34:54] <gseguin> that would be fantastic
[10:35:05] <todd_> btw - those opera transitions are especially slow on the slide ones
[10:35:13] <gseguin> we have an issue where pageshow is triggered twice
[10:35:14] <todd_> the pop and fade are fast
[10:35:22] <todd_> maybe we need to animate a diff. property?
[10:35:27] <todd_> hmm
[10:35:30] <todd_> lemme check it
[10:36:04] <gseguin> what other property would you transition on when doing a slide?
[10:36:27] <todd_> what are we using now? x/y?
[10:37:24] <gseguin> transition-property: transform
[10:37:44] <todd_> just tested on ipad 4.2 and gettign 1 got pageshow
[10:37:46] <gseguin> oh I guess we could use left and right
[10:38:12] <gseguin> and that's after bookmarking on home page, right?
[10:38:17] <todd_> yep
[10:38:23] <gseguin> hmm bummer
[10:38:30] <gseguin> I thought I had it
[10:38:52] <gseguin> so back to transitions
[10:39:14] <gseguin> we could do transition-property: left
[10:39:31] <gseguin> let me give it a try
[10:40:17] <miketaylr> back
[10:40:26] <miketaylr> dang, i do see the corners popping out... i'll file that
[10:43:05] <miketaylr> yeah, pop and fade are peachy... slide* are gross
[10:44:11] <gseguin> it doesn't like opera likes transition-property: transform too much
[10:45:31] <todd_> looks like it
[10:45:42] <todd_> bummer on the corners, they were working at one point
[10:46:21] <miketaylr> is there any box-shadow on the page transitions?
[10:48:06] * miketaylr looks
[10:48:59] <todd_> like, on the whole page?
[10:49:07] <todd_> elements inside have box shadow for sure
[10:49:28] <miketaylr> i found some perf bug related to transitioning elements w/ box-shadow
[10:50:29] <miketaylr> ok, i'm going to refile this transitions bug, and file the button corner one w/ the android mobile team
[10:56:02] <gseguin> todd_: transitioning on left seems to work for firefox and chrome, not opera
[10:56:28] <miketaylr> gseguin: which class are you testing that at?
[10:56:38] <miketaylr> in jquery.mobile.transitions.css, i assume?
[10:56:43] <gseguin> yes
[10:57:03] <miketaylr> is .animate webkit only?
[10:57:23] <gseguin> starting at l 32
[10:58:00] <miketaylr> .animate {
[10:58:00] <miketaylr> 	-webkit-transform-property: transform;
[10:58:00] <miketaylr> 	transition-property: transform;
[10:58:00] <miketaylr> }
[10:58:41] <gseguin> yeah
[10:59:03] <gseguin> I've added -o-transform-property there, that doesn't change anything
[10:59:12] <nimbu> okay so i am just looking at the css
[10:59:19] <miketaylr> nimbu is a CSS master
[10:59:22] <nimbu> just pointing this out coz it stuck me obviously
[10:59:23] <nimbu> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/transitions/themes/default/jquery.mobile.transitions.css#L35
[10:59:31] <gseguin> hey nimbu, thanks for joining
[10:59:54] <miketaylr> gseguin: there's -webkit-transform-prop and then just transition-prop
[11:00:16] <nimbu> and that transform is wrong
[11:00:26] <nimbu> same in L120 as well
[11:00:29] <nimbu> not sure what that is doing
[11:00:34] <gseguin> oh is it? what's wrong with it?
[11:00:59] <nimbu> transform takes in rotate/scale or skew
[11:01:04] <nimbu> not another "transform" property
[11:01:17] <nimbu> keyword even.
[11:01:29] <nimbu> so what are u trying to accomplish with those two lines of CSS?
[11:01:42] <gseguin> you mean it shouldn't be translateX ?
[11:02:02] <nimbu> Line 35 has no translateX
[11:02:17] <nimbu> http://gyazo.com/af67599607a1261f3d872ef64b10bf5a.png
[11:02:22] <nimbu> 3 same classnames
[11:02:35] <nimbu> and 2 lines of css that do not seem to have any reasonable effect on anything
[11:03:01] <gseguin> oh that's a typo, it should read -webkit -transition-property
[11:03:30] <nimbu> why are there 3 identical classnames.
[11:03:38] <nimbu> also transition-property does not work prefixless
[11:03:42] <gseguin> changing that
[11:04:01] <gseguin> it should be slide.animate, slideup.animate, slidedown.animate
[11:04:04] <nimbu> so it needs to have -moz/-ms/-o ms is supposed to have transitions in IE10 but yeah ie10 wont be in mobile for next year at least.
[11:04:05] <nimbu> okay
[11:04:07] <gseguin> lost it someehow
[11:04:10] <nimbu> its the same in L120
[11:04:58] <gseguin> changed
[11:05:04] <nimbu> and there are lots of properties here that dont have the -o- or -moz- prefixes ( at least), i suppose those need to be updated too?
[11:05:20] <miketaylr> nimbu: if you want to play along https://gist.github.com/1072390
[11:05:41] <nimbu> yeah let me do that.
[11:07:30] <gseguin> I pushed
[11:07:42] <miketaylr> i think what might be going on is the shorthand `transform` as the transition-property value
[11:07:59] <miketaylr> the spec was changed, iirc to allow shorthands--before it had to be explicity
[11:08:03] <miketaylr> we may not have updated to do that yet
[11:08:19] <miketaylr> s/explicity/explicit/
[11:08:35] <nimbu> transition u mean
[11:08:41] <miketaylr> probably
[11:08:45] <miketaylr> :P
[11:08:54] <nimbu> its such an outrage that transform and transition get confused so often
[11:09:01] <nimbu> thanks to everyone doing demos with transition/transforms
[11:09:32] <nimbu> okay making
[11:10:07] <miketaylr> git pull origin transitions to get up to date
[11:10:35] <nimbu> okay what should index.html show me?
[11:10:40] <nimbu> is there a specific page i need to click
[11:10:40] <gseguin> I have to run, can you share your findings by email? ghislain (at) gmail.com
[11:10:48] <miketaylr> yeah np gseguin
[11:10:52] <gseguin> I'll be back online in the afternoon
[11:10:55] <miketaylr> i'll send you logs
[11:11:02] <gseguin> nimbu: miketaylr what timezone are you on
[11:11:03] <gseguin> ?
[11:11:06] <miketaylr> i'm EST
[11:11:10] <nimbu> PST for me
[11:11:29] <gseguin> ok PDT here too so maybe I'll catch you later this afternoon
[11:11:53] <nimbu> okay
[11:12:05] <gseguin> thank you very much for helping us
[11:12:13] <gseguin> ttyl
[11:12:15] <miketaylr> later
[11:12:57] <miketaylr> nimbu: make your way over to http://miketaylr.com/post/07a926dd.png
[11:13:05] <nimbu> http://gyazo.com/c79f38fd4a8eb7ffd21fee01071e4d83.png
[11:13:13] <nimbu> o
[11:13:15] <nimbu> hmm
[11:13:19] <nimbu> i need a MAMP huh
[11:13:21] <miketaylr> yeah, it uses PHP to put everything together, iirc
[11:13:24] <nimbu> not just a random server
[11:13:25] <nimbu> ohh
[11:13:26] <nimbu> oops
[11:13:41] <miketaylr> does PHP have something like simpleHTTPServer?
[11:14:08] <nimbu> no :/
[11:14:13] <miketaylr> bummar
[11:14:16] <nimbu> never mind i will upload to my ftp
[11:14:22] <miketaylr> kay
[11:14:46] <miketaylr> we've got some stupid regression w/ border radius in Opera Mobile 11.1 it appears
[11:14:54] <miketaylr> you'll see soon enough
[11:14:57] <nimbu> o gross okay
[11:16:00] <miketaylr> pop and fade are good, slide, slideup, and slidedown cause it nearly hang
[11:17:50] <nimbu> oh kay.
[11:18:54] * miketaylr files border radius bug
[11:23:04] <nimbu> ah it does look a lot better
[11:23:49] <nimbu> wow the slide shit is crazy
[11:26:41] <nimbu> i can see the border radius thing
[11:26:43] <nimbu> did u file a bug?
[11:26:46] <nimbu> i wanna see what u wrote
[11:27:28] <miketaylr> i'm installing the latest opera mobile bug to see if it's there first
[11:28:11] <miketaylr> s/bug/build/
[11:28:12] <miketaylr> lol
[11:29:21] <nimbu> haha
[11:29:22] <nimbu> okay
[11:38:52] <miketaylr> nimbu: 	ANDMO-1577 filed for border-radius
[11:39:50] <nimbu> o cool
[11:52:17] <todd_> miketaylr and nimbu - thanks for looking into these bugs so quickly. we really appreciate it!
[11:52:27] <miketaylr> heh, hopefully we can fix them :)
[11:52:34] <todd_> fingers crossed
[11:52:39] <nimbu> yah this compiling
[11:52:42] <nimbu> and fixing is like :/
[11:52:53] <todd_> so many browsers blow up when you use gradients + box-shadow + border-radius
[11:52:59] <todd_> heh
[11:53:04] <miketaylr> CSS3 is a total trojan horse
[11:53:13] <miketaylr> oooh shiny!
[11:53:14] <miketaylr> KABLAMMO
[11:53:18] <nimbu> ha
[11:53:37] <todd_> seriously. must be tricky to render everything just right on your side
[11:53:43] <todd_> shall we go back to sliding doors then?
[11:53:50] <todd_> plan b
[11:53:52] <miketaylr> haha
[11:53:53] <miketaylr> call zeldman
[11:53:56] <todd_> (kidding)
[11:54:05] <todd_> maybe he can fit it
[11:54:10] <miketaylr> the old school is back, baby
[11:54:19] <todd_> you see we're pulling gradients from IE for the same problem
[11:54:27] <miketaylr> yeah i saw the blog post
[11:54:44] <todd_> love that mango isn't out and they won't fix such a glaring issue
[11:54:52] <todd_> told me to switch over to using pngs
[11:55:08] <todd_> i told 'em they'd get flat color or no corners...pick your poison
[11:55:33] <todd_> bummer tho
[11:55:53] <todd_> ie9 was supposed to fix everything. unicorn rainbow randerign engines
[11:55:56] <miketaylr> we don't have to `make` to see CSS tweaks, right?
[11:56:06] <todd_> nope
[11:56:11] <miketaylr> that's what i though cc nimbu
[11:56:20] <todd_> if you have mamp setup, you can make local changes, save, refresh
[11:56:21] <miketaylr> *thought
[11:56:23] <nimbu> oh
[11:56:27] <miketaylr> i suck at typing
[11:56:31] <nimbu> there is a compiled css file tho?
[11:56:32] <nimbu> whats that
[11:56:33] <todd_> me too
[11:56:44] <todd_> just for dev
[11:56:51] <todd_> php to combine all the css
[11:57:00] <nimbu> yeah so how do i test in index.html
[11:57:05] <todd_> in production, you have a single, compressed css file
[11:57:12] <nimbu> o i see
[11:57:13] <nimbu> okay
[11:57:18] <todd_> so once you clone down the branch
[11:57:19] <miketaylr> nimbu: just tweak the CSS and refresh index
[11:57:23] <todd_> flip on MAMP
[11:57:23] <nimbu> so php does the hardworkd for now
[11:57:24] <nimbu> oh whew
[11:57:25] <todd_> ya
[11:57:44] <todd_> not as scary as it looks
[11:57:59] <todd_> once you have MAMP running
[12:07:10] <nimbu> miketaylr: do u know how to figure out which classnames are applied when a link is clicked to find out which transition is working on the stuff
[12:07:19] <nimbu> so i wanna know if its slide in or what not
[12:07:41] <nimbu> and its too quick for me to see :/ was wondering if u seen it already
[12:07:44] <miketaylr> hmm dragonfly doesn't update that immediately
[12:07:56] <nimbu> yeah
[12:08:08] <miketaylr> one sec
[12:27:32] <nimbu> is there anything special that occurs with the animate class
[12:27:47] <nimbu> because I dont see any special animatiosn that occur on the animate class yet there is .slide.out.animate
[12:27:51] <nimbu> and .slide.out
[12:30:51] <miketaylr> hmm
[12:34:16] <miketaylr> oh nimbu in line 42 of jquery.mobile.transition.js animate gets added
[12:34:30] <nimbu> oh k
[12:35:18] <nimbu> ahh
[12:35:24] <nimbu> okay best to look at it too then!
[12:35:29] <miketaylr> pulling your hair out?
[12:36:04] <nimbu> ahhh
[12:36:05] <nimbu> YES
[12:36:17] <nimbu> why is this animate class being added in 25ms :||
[12:36:30] * miketaylr knowsnt
[12:37:18] <todd_> I think these classes are pretty easy to read
[12:37:18] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/transitions/themes/default/jquery.mobile.transitions.css
[12:37:36] <todd_> they map to the transition names pretty clearly
[12:37:58] <nimbu> i dont see an animate class
[12:38:02] <nimbu> that "starts" animation
[12:38:07] <todd_> js for this too
[12:38:07] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/transitions/js/jquery.mobile.transition.js
[12:38:16] <nimbu> o i do now
[12:38:20] <nimbu> .slide.animate etc
[12:38:22] <nimbu> okay
[12:38:26] <todd_> that help?
[12:38:47] <todd_> gseguin is deep into this so he may be able to answer anything I can't
[12:39:20] <todd_> "animate" looks like the class added to start it off
[12:39:25] <nimbu> yeah but the styles
[12:39:28] <nimbu> seem to be impacted by it
[12:39:33] <nimbu> .slide.in has a diff transform
[12:39:37] <nimbu> compared to .slide.in.animate
[12:39:40] <nimbu> so i am wondering why
[12:41:48] <miketaylr> nimbu: if i do this, the slides work http://miketaylr.com/post/53f6ab54.png
[12:41:50] <todd_> master doesn't have these timeouts so gseguin would need to answer why these were added
[12:41:52] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.transition.js
[12:41:54] <miketaylr> a little jerky on desktop sometimes
[12:41:56] <todd_> so i'm not sure
[12:42:11] <miketaylr> but a little jerky in chrome too
[12:42:24] <nimbu> no in and out miketaylr?
[12:42:35] <todd_> we're open to doing this in the best possible waty, so if we're doign things wrong please tell us!
[12:42:39] <miketaylr> :D
[12:42:41] <nimbu> haha
[12:42:43] <nimbu> sure
[12:42:48] <nimbu> i am just trying to understand now
[12:42:51] <nimbu> what is occuring
[12:42:53] <miketaylr> no way, these secrets will die with me
[12:42:53] <todd_> this stuff always seems like black magic
[12:42:58] <nimbu> :PP
[12:43:03] <todd_> we'll get 'em out of you
[12:43:14] <todd_> release the hounds!
[12:44:06] <nimbu> miketaylr: it does not seel to slide tho
[12:44:12] <nimbu> seem*
[12:44:26] <nimbu> its just like fading
[12:44:34] <miketaylr> waaaa
[12:44:36] <miketaylr> sliding for me
[12:44:46] <nimbu> gimme ur css file
[12:44:48] <nimbu> i copy paste exactly
[12:45:01] <miketaylr> eh "sliding"
[12:45:16] <miketaylr> https://gist.github.com/cc1b890f8e175579f134
[12:45:42] <miketaylr> i'm just testing in desktop right now, fwiw
[12:46:35] <miketaylr> i guess just changing -o-transition-property: from transform to all would achieve the same effect
[12:46:40] <miketaylr> but all can have bad perf
[12:46:44] <nimbu> ah it does
[12:46:54] <nimbu> but its jerkkky
[12:47:01] <miketaylr> yeah :/
[12:47:10] <todd_> black magic
[12:47:46] <todd_> i didn't realize opera supported transforms and transitions
[12:47:59] <miketaylr> i wish they would realease a hw accelerated build for mac
[12:48:04] <todd_> so transition is hardware accel?
[12:48:15] <miketaylr> right now everything is software accelerated
[12:48:21] <todd_> ah
[12:48:26] <miketaylr> hw accelerated stuff is still in dev
[12:48:27] <nimbu> :)
[12:48:30] <todd_> makes sucha  big difference
[12:48:34] <miketaylr> ya
[12:49:00] <miketaylr> i'm hoping that lands by O12
[12:57:23] <nimbu> using margin-left is much faster for opera
[12:57:36] <nimbu> nimbupani.com/opera/index.html#/opera/docs/about/features.html
[12:58:05] <nimbu> but it still zooms out
[12:58:10] <nimbu> i think it has smthing to do with viewport
[12:59:22] <miketaylr> ah, for "slide"?
[12:59:51] <nimbu> yeah
[13:00:07] <miketaylr> yeah, that's working nice on desktop right now
[13:05:56] <miketaylr> nimbu: can you add -o- props to the .pop classes?
[13:06:23] <miketaylr> that will made the dialog less terrifying
[13:06:27] <miketaylr> s/made/make/
[13:06:31] <nimbu> haha
[13:06:31] <nimbu> okay
[13:06:36] <nimbu> wait i am still tweaking
[13:06:38] <miketaylr> it has a default transition of pop
[13:06:40] <nimbu> we can use -o-viewport
[13:06:41] <miketaylr> okay cool cool
[13:06:42] <nimbu> to fix
[13:07:35] <nimbu> how about now (not for pop)
[13:07:51] <nimbu> hmm pop already has -o- in my site
[13:07:52] <nimbu> i added
[13:07:55] <miketaylr> ah ok
[13:07:57] <nimbu> it still does not slide
[13:08:02] <nimbu> which is weird :/
[13:08:11] <miketaylr> what doesn't slide?
[13:08:19] <nimbu> the way it slides in chrome
[13:08:21] <nimbu> the pages
[13:08:24] <nimbu> one to the other
[13:09:18] <miketaylr> oh, like the fadey transition?
[13:09:29] <nimbu> the slidey one :/
[13:09:33] <nimbu> it seems to just show
[13:09:35] <nimbu> not slide
[13:09:36] <nimbu> in opera mob
[13:10:02] <nimbu> ah slides in opera desktop
[13:10:12] <nimbu> but jerky
[13:11:28] <nimbu> well i think the only fix i can see
[13:11:34] <nimbu> is @-o-viewport {
[13:11:34] <nimbu>   min-zoom: 1;
[13:11:34] <nimbu> }
[13:11:40] <nimbu> this would help in not zooming out
[13:11:56] <nimbu> when there are two pages at the same time
[13:12:09] <nimbu> but then i dunno if this would impact the zoom out feature of the app
[13:12:18] <nimbu> i need to test it on my phone
[13:12:30] <nimbu> k gtg lunch time.
[13:12:34] <miketaylr> kk
[13:27:07] <miketaylr> bot-t: tell nimbu i'll probably be gone if and when you get back. please report any progress in DSK-341845 or DEVREL-1748. KTHXBAI
[13:27:08] <bot-t> miketaylr, Okay.
[13:45:51] <todd_> thanks miketaylr and nimbu - y'all rokk
[13:46:15] <todd_> btw - gseguin, these guys had a pull related to transitions, maybe some decent ideas in there?
[13:46:15] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1930
[15:24:47] <gseguin> and I'm back
[15:25:04] * gseguin 's got a lot of catch up to do
[15:28:13] <gseguin> todd_: still there?
[15:45:48] <gseguin> hey nimbu, I don't know exacly why the .addClass happens in a setTimeout
[15:45:53] <gseguin> this comes from https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1445
[15:46:07] <nimbu> hey gseguin	
[15:46:14] <nimbu> wow it sez there are no users here for me
[15:46:16] <nimbu> :|||
[15:46:43] <gseguin> oh really? like no user in the channel ?
[15:46:46] <gseguin> weird
[15:47:32] <gseguin> so that setTimeout I noticed that actually increasing slightly from 0 to 25 makes the transition much smoother on iPad 4.2.1 (if I recall correctly)
[15:48:00] <nimbu> o i see.
[15:48:11] <gseguin> I haven't investigated as to why
[15:48:33] <gseguin> did you try removing it to see if opera behaved better without it?
[15:48:51] <nimbu> i have only made opera not zoom
[15:49:02] <nimbu> and by using margins instead of translatex and y
[15:49:07] <nimbu> opera is significantly faster
[15:49:15] <nimbu> and slides even.
[15:49:16] <gseguin> do you have a gist?
[15:49:22] <gseguin> so I can try it out
[15:49:29] <nimbu> i dont actually.
[15:49:31] <gseguin> or a jsbin
[15:49:36] <gseguin> ok
[15:49:38] <nimbu> i have here with -o-viewport
[15:49:43] <nimbu> http://nimbupani.com/opera/index.html#/opera/docs/about/platforms.html
[15:50:15] <nimbu> no change from your css.
[15:50:56] <nimbu> other than the view port thing at the bottom
[15:51:03] <nimbu> @-o-viewport {
[15:51:03] <nimbu>   min-zoom: 1;
[15:51:03] <nimbu> }
[15:51:07] <nimbu> i will create a gist with margins
[15:51:40] <gseguin> it already does look much better, I mean it's jumpy but it's better than before
[15:51:42] <nimbu> also these transitions can be combined into a shorthand i was wondering if u had any reason to keep the split.
[15:52:09] <gseguin> what do you mean ?
[15:52:30] <nimbu> i mean transitions and animations
[15:52:32] <nimbu> e.g. 	-webkit-animation-name: spin;
[15:52:32] <nimbu> 	-webkit-animation-duration: 1s;
[15:52:32] <nimbu> 	-webkit-animation-iteration-count:  infinite;
[15:52:32] <nimbu> 	-webkit-animation-timing-function: linear;
[15:52:42] <nimbu> can be -webkit-animation: spin 1s infinite linear;
[15:52:44] <gseguin> oh no, no reason
[15:52:59] <nimbu> 	-webkit-transition-timing-function: ease-in-out;
[15:52:59] <nimbu> 	-webkit-transition-duration: 350ms;
[15:52:59] <nimbu>  can be -webkit-transition: 350ms ease-in-out;
[15:53:00] <nimbu> okay
[15:53:12] <gseguin> I'll change that once we get it to work
[15:53:20] <nimbu> okay
[15:57:28] <gseguin> so you what value do you use for margins?
[15:57:50] <gseguin> nimbu: ^^^
[15:58:02] <nimbu> gseguin 100%
[15:58:15] <nimbu> margin-left: 100% and 0 and −100%
[15:58:25] <gseguin> oh margin-left ?
[15:58:36] <nimbu> yeah like its translateX equivalent
[15:58:51] <gseguin> oh silly me!
[15:58:52] <nimbu> but i am not sure if its smooth in chrome
[15:58:52] <gseguin> :)
[15:58:54] <nimbu> i ahve not tested
[15:59:04] <nimbu> i was just trying to make it work in opera mobile
[15:59:11] <gseguin> I was doing it with margin-right, duh!
[16:01:03] <nimbu> :)
[16:02:57] <gseguin> works well on chrome
[16:03:06] <gseguin> not too well on opera desktop
[16:03:39] <nimbu> o
[16:03:57] <nimbu> can haz pastie
[16:04:49] <gseguin> coming right up
[16:05:55] <gseguin> https://gist.github.com/b121f6cc859f8ae9b937
[16:06:46] <nimbu> its pretty good on opera mob!
[16:06:53] <nimbu> now if only someone has an iphone to test
[16:06:54] <nimbu> :P
[16:06:59] <nimbu> nimbupani.com/opera/index.html#/opera/docs/about/platforms.html
[16:07:28] <gseguin> unfortunately my iPod touch refuses to go on the network
[16:07:45] <gseguin> I'm gonna go grab the iPad at the office
[16:07:45] <nimbu> i can test on android browser
[16:08:34] <gseguin> did you put the slide w/ margin-left transitions in your page?
[16:08:58] <nimbu> yep
[16:11:28] <nimbu> it seems okay to me
[16:11:33] <nimbu> but i dont have any cpu measurements
[16:13:53] <nimbu> i think translateX will also be slow and cranky in FF
[16:14:49] <nimbu> gseguin^
[16:14:57] <gseguin> I didn't do any measurement but it works well on my core i7 ;)
[16:15:13] <nimbu> :)
[16:15:32] <nimbu> i gotta dl ff for android
[16:16:00] * gseguin is doing the same
[16:19:50] <nimbu> oops no -moz-transition there :P
[16:20:19] <gseguin> -moz-transition-property you mean?
[16:20:24] <nimbu> yeah
[16:20:33] <nimbu> just added
[16:21:29] <gseguin> does it cause ff to fail?
[16:21:40] <nimbu> no it just doesnt have trans
[16:23:30] <nimbu> it seems to be better than whats there right now.
[16:23:34] <nimbu> on ff android as well
[16:23:35] <gseguin> not working with it either, is it?
[16:23:39] <nimbu> no it works
[16:23:45] <nimbu> when I added moz-transition-property
[16:24:12] <gseguin> I did add it
[16:24:30] <nimbu> it wasnt there here: .slide.animate,
[16:24:30] <nimbu> .slideup.animate,
[16:24:30] <nimbu> .slidedown.animate {
[16:24:30] <nimbu> 	-webkit-transition-property: margin-left;
[16:24:30] <nimbu> 	-o-transition-property: margin-left;
[16:24:30] <nimbu> 	transition-property: margin-left;
[16:24:30] <nimbu> }
[16:24:34] <nimbu> but now i have it.
[16:24:35] <nimbu> and it works
[16:24:41] <nimbu> so i see no problemo using margins
[16:24:56] <gseguin> yeah it wasn't there but I added it
[16:25:01] <nimbu> okay cool
[16:25:11] <gseguin> but it's not working for me
[16:25:15] <nimbu> o
[16:25:16] <nimbu> ?
[16:25:18] <nimbu> in ff?
[16:25:21] <gseguin> ff
[16:25:58] <nimbu> really in ff beta?
[16:26:00] <nimbu> or ff?
[16:26:16] <gseguin> let me double check
[16:26:28] <gseguin> loading opera 11.1 mobile right now
[16:27:04] <nimbu> okay
[16:27:10] <nimbu> coz it works for me in ff beta
[16:27:13] <nimbu> and on ff 5
[16:27:39] <nimbu> ff mobile beta and ff desktop 5 that is
[16:28:52] <gseguin> oh ok, I have ff5 mobile
[16:28:59] <gseguin> let me install beta mobile
[16:32:59] <gseguin> I don't get the transitions in ff beta
[16:33:08] <nimbu> hmm
[16:33:11] <nimbu> on my site?
[16:33:18] <gseguin> yup
[16:33:22] <nimbu> weird
[16:33:23] <nimbu> i do
[16:33:30] <gseguin> android version?
[16:34:10] <nimbu> nexus s 2.3.4 it sez
[16:34:23] <gseguin> I have 2.2
[16:34:26] <nimbu> gingerbread
[16:34:28] <nimbu> hmmm
[16:34:29] <nimbu> :s
[16:34:42] <gseguin> let me grab a gingerbread
[16:34:44] <gseguin> brb
[16:34:45] <nimbu> okay
[16:39:47] <gseguin> yeah no I don't get slide transitions on ff beta / Android 2.3.4
[16:39:49] <gseguin> :(
[16:40:18] <nimbu> weird
[16:40:20] <nimbu> :///
[16:40:27] <gseguin> I know!
[16:43:54] <nimbu> did u click thro to subsequent pages
[16:43:55] <nimbu> etc
[16:44:09] <nimbu> coz when it takes time to load it does not always load correctly >_>
[16:44:44] <gseguin> I went to index.html
[16:44:53] <nimbu> yes.
[16:44:56] <gseguin> and then navigated to the transition page
[16:45:05] <gseguin> by clicking on the buttons
[16:45:13] <gseguin> the jQM buttons
[16:45:30] <nimbu> wow lame ff beta does not have tabs
[16:45:51] <gseguin> it does
[16:45:59] <gseguin> just swipe right on the page
[16:46:01] <nimbu> o?
[16:46:06] <nimbu> omg
[16:46:09] <nimbu> i see it.
[16:46:29] <nimbu> boy its transitioning for me when i click slide
[16:46:33] <nimbu> is it just my phone :(
[16:47:36] <nimbu> ha yay 5 transitions and crash
[16:48:23] <gseguin> and is it the first time you try on ff beta?
[16:48:30] <nimbu> yeah
[16:48:43] <gseguin> meaning are you sure the version doesnt come out of your cache?
[16:48:50] <nimbu> oh yeah
[16:48:54] <nimbu> i just downloaded it
[16:48:55] <gseguin> ok
[16:49:02] <gseguin> damn!
[16:49:04] <nimbu> i had only android and opera mobile before
[16:49:55] <gseguin> alright well let's focus on opera, I don't want to use too much of your time with that, I'll go bug the mozilla people about FF
[16:50:14] <nimbu> ha okay.
[16:50:22] <nimbu> yeah so it seems okay on opera for me.
[16:50:30] <nimbu> maybe need to test slideup and down and the rest too
[16:50:32] <nimbu> but i can do that now
[16:53:33] <gseguin> yeah it's working for me too on opera
[16:53:53] <gseguin> any chance we can find a trick to not have the address bar coming down?
[16:57:21] <nimbu> so my friend conf it slides on nexus one 2.3
[16:57:24] <nimbu> for ff beta
[16:57:28] <nimbu> :/
[16:57:35] <nimbu> maybe it doesnt slide elsewhere!
[16:58:30] <nimbu> gseguin what do u mean by addressbar coming down? :/
[16:58:35] <nimbu> coz i dont see it in mine.
[16:58:51] <gseguin> the url bar when you click the slide button
[16:59:05] <nimbu> and I am on lets see opera 11.1
[16:59:07] <nimbu> are uon it?
[16:59:10] <nimbu> o
[16:59:32] <nimbu> aha
[16:59:34] <nimbu> so it does
[16:59:35] <nimbu> hmm
[17:00:44] <gseguin> yeah nimbu opera 11.1
[17:05:58] <gseguin> nimbu: do you get that too?
[17:06:13] <nimbu> yeah i do
[17:06:20] <nimbu> and i think its coz of the #?
[17:06:33] <nimbu> coz opera mobile 11.1 does not have pushState yet :(
[17:06:59] <nimbu> also the latest ff multi or whatever beta thats on their site does not render transitions AT ALL for either translateX or margin
[17:07:09] <nimbu> o wait
[17:07:17] <nimbu> sorry take back the word for translateX
[17:07:31] <nimbu> coz its possible that http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b1/ does not have a moz prefix
[17:07:53] <gseguin> yeah it doesn't
[17:08:08] <gseguin> it's got only -webkit prefixes as of today
[17:08:16] <gseguin> and it's using animation keyframes
[17:08:30] <nimbu> ohh okay
[17:08:35] <nimbu> ah no wonder then
[17:08:48] <gseguin> which as I understand doesn't work on FF, hence the attempt to switch to transitions
[17:08:55] <nimbu> yep
[17:09:11] <gseguin> sorry we didn't give you the context
[17:09:17] <nimbu> naw its okay.
[17:09:24] <nimbu> i think margins should work everywhere
[17:09:34] <nimbu> i know there is this view that u need to use GPU acc stuff for everything
[17:09:56] <nimbu> but i am not sure how it plays elsewhere
[17:12:57] <gseguin> best would be to gracefully degrade
[17:13:25] <nimbu> which it would
[17:14:06] <gseguin> even using transitions on margin, would it actually use GPU acc ?
[17:14:14] <nimbu> no it wont
[17:14:28] <gseguin> I thought you had to use the *3d properties
[17:14:29] <nimbu> webkit uses gpu accell only on transforms
[17:14:30] <gseguin> oh ok,
[17:14:45] <nimbu> and opacity
[17:14:53] <nimbu> from what i know of this html5rocks article
[17:15:33] <nimbu> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/html5/
[17:16:21] <nimbu> hah maybe i am wrong
[17:17:37] <gseguin> on?
[17:17:39] <nimbu> or not.
[17:17:47] <nimbu> "CSS Transitions make style animation trivial for everyone, but they also are a smart performance feature. Because a CSS transition is managed by the browser, the fidelity of its animation can be greatly improved, and in many cases hardware accelerated. Currently WebKit (Chrome, Safari, iOS) have hardware accelerated CSS transforms, but it's coming quickly to other browsers and platforms."
[17:18:00] <nimbu> i think only transforms are hw-acc when transitioned
[17:19:32] <gseguin> so we would need some kind of feature detection to figure out whether to use margins of transform
[17:20:35] <nimbu> it depends really
[17:20:40] <nimbu> sm browsers really drain battery
[17:20:43] <nimbu> with transforms
[17:20:46] <nimbu> coz of gpu usage
[17:20:55] <nimbu> :s
[17:21:14] <gseguin> good point
[17:21:53] <nimbu> gseguin https://gist.github.com/1073126 is where i am at
[17:22:02] <nimbu> i trust u can create the shorthands for the stuff
[17:22:08] <nimbu> that is the latest code i have.
[17:22:38] <nimbu> i am still not sure why the .animate class is necessary but i hope i can understand it when I re-read that issue
[17:23:20] <gseguin> alright, I'll copy your gist into my workspace and will probably check it in over the weekend
[17:23:29] <nimbu> okay awes.
[17:23:51] <gseguin> thank you very much for your help
