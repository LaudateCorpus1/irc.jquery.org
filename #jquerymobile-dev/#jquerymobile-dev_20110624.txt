[09:35:30] <kinblas> toddparker: regarding 1923
[09:35:51] <kinblas> there's no action on the form, we just need to handle that case ... it looks like we never have
[09:41:10] <kinblas> also, it looks like the guy needs to use data-ajax="false" or whatever the magic attribute is so that his login page gets replaced with his app page
