[06:13:10] <gates> Hello, I am using jQuery Mobile for a web application and I am using AJAX page changes but removing the "old" page from the dom once the transition has finished loading. I have a few javascript functions that load on all pages function testFunction() { ... } but it seems once I remove the original page (the one that first loaded namely) the functions no
[06:13:10] <gates> longer exist.
[06:13:15] <gates> How do I load these functions each time a page change happens?
[06:14:00] <gates> I tried a few on() functions (live is obviously deprecated) and I alway get a function doesn't exist unless I do not wrap the function in any additional javascript
[06:21:30] <uGoMobi> gates: #jquery is the channel for support, also for jQuery Mobile
[06:21:50] <uGoMobi> gates: also, removing the initial page isn't supported
[06:22:03] <gates> page.remove()
[06:22:03] <uGoMobi> gates: see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4050 and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3249
[06:22:41] <gates> So you are saying I should not use page.remove();
[06:22:53] <_|Nix|_> gates: Not a good idea.
[06:23:12] <_|Nix|_> gates: AJAX-ed pages are removed automatically when you navigate away from them. Not so the original page.
[06:31:22] <toddmparker> Good mornings
[06:52:17] <arschmitz> Morning toddmparker
[07:00:55] <gates> https://gist.github.com/mprogano/5048279
[07:03:20] <toddmparker> Hi arschmitz 
[07:03:21] <toddmparker> How goes?
[07:03:30] <arschmitz> great your self?
[07:07:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: been thinking a lot about widgets outside of pages and had a question for you.
[07:12:21] <uGoMobi> morning guys
[07:14:37] <_|Nix|_> Hey, all!
[07:14:50] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[07:15:18] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did you see my comment at slider.tooltip and popup.arrow CSS?
[07:15:53] <uGoMobi> comments at the commits I mean
[07:17:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: your prefetch / base tag fix could go into 1.3.1, right?
[07:18:13] <arschmitz> yes sorry i meant to cherry pick that
[07:18:27] <arschmitz> it actually needs to go into 1.1 stable and 1.2 stable too
[07:18:32] <uGoMobi> ah ok, no problem
[07:18:44] <arschmitz> its a pre 1.0 issue lol
[07:18:51] <uGoMobi> wow
[07:19:14] <arschmitz> its just always been that way we never accounted for prefetching when updating base tag
[07:19:35] <uGoMobi> right
[07:19:40] <uGoMobi> better late than never :)
[07:19:58] <arschmitz> yeah and it does not seem to cause too too many problems generally 
[07:20:17] <arschmitz> it only shows up if you prefetch AND have links to other directorys 
[07:24:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so iv been thinking about page.sections
[07:25:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think we should get rid of it completely make a toolbar widget to handle header and footer (fixedToolbars would then extend this) and all page.sections does for content is add classes / attributes seems like we could move this into the page widget.
[07:25:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: FYI - changed milestone on that closed base tag issue to 1.1.2 and added to 1.1.2 release notes wiki page
[07:25:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: awesome thanks
[07:26:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I agree
[07:26:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: removing page.sections like this would fix the dynamic toolbars issue too
[07:27:05] <uGoMobi> toolbars aren't only used on pages anymore... also popups
[07:27:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: right
[07:27:45] <uGoMobi> content as part of page widget sounds good too
[07:27:52] <arschmitz> yea so having a toolbar widget to handle all things toolbars will make a lot more sense i think
[07:28:14] <uGoMobi> all we do is adding ui-content class and role="main" right?
[07:28:31] <arschmitz> and theme
[07:28:35] <uGoMobi> it does indeed
[07:29:00] <uGoMobi> it's not a widget when it has position inline but when you set option to fixed it becomes a widget
[07:29:27] <arschmitz> yeah that does not make sense to me lol
[07:29:30] <uGoMobi> that makes less sense
[07:29:35] <uGoMobi> right lol
[07:30:00] <arschmitz> it also removes the dependancy making it easier to move them outside a page!
[07:30:50] <uGoMobi> yes we can bind the enhancement function to create and pagecreate
[07:30:56] <arschmitz> yup
[07:33:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: how about making dialog an option in the page widget. do you think we better wait with that until 1.5?
[07:33:41] <arschmitz> we already talked about that i think
[07:33:53] <arschmitz> and its going to happen i thought for 1.4 but maybe 1.5
[07:34:22] <arschmitz> i wonder if it would be ok to announce some deprecation with 1.3.1 for stuff going away in 1.4
[07:34:36] <arschmitz> i know it really should have been 1.3.0 but maybe if we do it soon?
[07:35:11] <arschmitz> im going to try and talk to johnbender today about the page widget and his plans for page containers
[07:35:21] <arschmitz> im thinking we could move a lot of stuff into the page widget
[07:35:30] <arschmitz> the page widget does almost nothing right now lol
[07:35:47] <uGoMobi> yeah, lazy bastard
[07:36:08] <arschmitz> like i was thinking shouldnt the page widget emit the page events?
[07:36:12] <uGoMobi> deprecating in 1.3.1 is not an option I think
[07:36:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i meant just annouce its going away in 1.4
[07:36:42] <arschmitz> not actually change anything
[07:36:48] <arschmitz> but you still are probably right
[07:37:04] <uGoMobi> yes, I understand

[08:05:57] <uGoMobi> hmm... just tried http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/ on IE8/Win7 on browserstack and I get a c-grade page
[08:06:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: A JS syntax error, maybe?

[08:10:19] <_|Nix|_> *sigh*
[08:10:20] <uGoMobi> looking at the line number in jQuery core it has to do with AJAX
[08:20:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: 1.3.0 worked 
[08:20:49] <arschmitz> oh wait never mind misread version ignore me lol

[08:26:16] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 140896247 15Gabriel Schulhof: Slider tooltip: "class" is a reserved word in IE.
[08:26:35] <_|Nix|_> Unfortunately grunt lint doesn't catch ^
[08:40:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: js2-mode in emacs does :)
[08:41:11] <johnbender> arschmitz: the container is ostensibly "above" a page
[08:41:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Cool! Too bad I don't use emacs ...
[08:41:46] <johnbender> arschmitz: though there's certainly some overlap
[08:41:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I wonder if we can't put that into the linter ...
[08:41:55] <johnbender> arschmitz: but a container manages "page" transitions 
[08:42:02] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I wouldn't be surprised
[08:42:41] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1439: UNSTABLE in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1439/
[08:42:42] <arschmitz> johnbender: maybe if you have some time at some point we could talk about what you have in mind for the containers id like to see your thinking on it
[08:44:06] <johnbender> arschmitz: for the most part I was thinking of just taking all that stuff that's sitting in nav and moving into a container widget
[08:44:17] <johnbender> and from there cleaning up a bit
[08:45:53] <arschmitz> johnbender: just out of curiosity why wouldnt you move a lot of the page state managment events etc into the page widget and have the page widget manage it self essentially and then just have something else to manage interaction between pages?
[08:46:19] <arschmitz> so for example when a page needs to be removed you can just call destroy on the page widget
[08:46:29] <johnbender> arschmitz: beforepagechange happens before a page exisits
[08:46:29] <arschmitz> and the page widget could emit most of the "page" events
[08:46:56] <johnbender> arschmitz: alot of them are poorly named
[08:47:08] <arschmitz> johnbender: right that why i said "most" lol
[08:47:08] <johnbender> that might be "beforecontentchange"
[08:47:16] <johnbender> arschmitz: then it's a consistency issue
[08:47:33] <johnbender> and where the events are triggered
[08:47:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: jshint does not catch that :(
[08:47:57] <johnbender> I assume splitting it up would suggest that you'd trigger othe "other" page events on the page itself
[08:48:16] <johnbender> and then the "pre/post page" events on the container
[08:48:21] <johnbender> which is confusing
[08:48:40] <arschmitz> johnbender: a widget can trigger an event on document too but yest by other i was refering to those
[08:49:15] <johnbender> arschmitz: for sure, but I'd imagine you'd use _trigger
[08:49:19] <johnbender> which is element specific
[08:49:25] <johnbender> otherwise there isn't much difference
[08:49:30] <johnbender> just where the code resides
[08:49:48] <johnbender> and then you're sacrificing locality
[08:49:55] <johnbender> arschmitz: not saying we can't do it
[08:50:00] <johnbender> just saying it's complicated :/
[08:50:57] <arschmitz> yeah 
[08:51:30] <arschmitz> was just thinking that it might be nice to have the page widget actually manage the page
[08:51:40] <arschmitz> and its state
[08:52:19] <arschmitz> and then have a higher level utility of some sort widget or otherwise to mangae interaction between pages
[08:52:39] <arschmitz> seems like better organization to me but it was just a thought
[08:52:48] <arschmitz> its complicated regardless
[09:14:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Any objections to updating to requirejs 2.1.4?

[14:10:27] <agcolom> hello, just in case someone is around... 
[14:11:38] <agcolom> I'm having a look at the issues... there are a few reagarding nested lists... since we're deprecating those, it might be a good idea to have a standard line on all issues regarding nested lists? (e.g. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1777)
[14:12:33] <agcolom> Is it a case of 'won't fix as nested lists are deprecated in 1.3.0' (but written is a more gentle way)?
[14:12:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping!
[14:13:17] <agcolom> hello Jasper :-)
[14:13:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne :)
[14:13:48] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5706
[14:13:51] <agcolom> sorry I've been so busy lately! 
[14:14:01] <agcolom> yes
[14:14:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I will ask _|Nix|_ about it because I think he has been working on popup and focus before 1.3 release
[14:14:32] <uGoMobi> if I am not mistaken it had to do with issues on iOS
[14:14:48] <agcolom> sure. that's a good idea. 
[14:15:05] <agcolom> Thanks
[14:15:18] <uGoMobi> np
[14:15:29] <agcolom> what should we do about the nested list issues?
