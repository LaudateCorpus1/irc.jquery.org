[16:06:32] <toddmparker_> Hey all
[16:18:13] <toddmparker_> garann - you happen to be around?
[16:21:17] <garann> 'sup toddmparker_
[17:15:47] <toddmparker_> oh hey garann!
[17:15:58] <toddmparker_> first off, mind if I get your email?
[17:16:04] <toddmparker_> setting up a basecamp for jQM
[17:29:39] <garann> toddmparker_: sure thing - garann@gmail.com
[17:33:18] <toddmparker_> cool, adding you now garann
[17:34:52] <toddmparker_> ok, you're in
[17:35:23] <toddmparker_> so i was testing the fixed headers garann
[17:35:29] <toddmparker_> this is going to be pretty slick
[17:36:01] <toddmparker_> gotta admit I'm not too familiar with these scripts
[17:36:39] <toddmparker_> I just added a z-index into those two rules:
[17:36:42] <toddmparker_> .ui-page .ui-header-fixed { top: 0px; position: fixed; z-index: 1000; }
[17:36:42] <toddmparker_> .ui-page .ui-footer-fixed { bottom: 0px; position: fixed; z-index: 1000; }
[17:37:08] <toddmparker_> i need to tinker around because I think popups and custom selects should sit over fixed toolbars, right?
[17:37:12] <garann> ah, cool
[17:37:18] <garann> yeah, i'd think so
[17:37:36] <garann> anything with a z-index would probably sit over them the way i had them when i checked em in
[17:38:09] <toddmparker_> one thing I noticed is that setting these to fixed position takes them out of the doc flow (of course) so the content butts up too close to the toolbars or is even obscured by it
[17:38:28] <toddmparker_> ideas on how to address this cleanly?
[17:38:49] <garann> hm.. for dynamic content, i'm not sure
[17:39:01] <garann> or, not dynamic, but content we don't know about
[17:39:02] <toddmparker_> since we don't know the height of the toolbars, I don't think we can just guess and tack in a margin
[17:39:08] <garann> yeah
[17:39:18] <garann> i guess it's back to js for that
[17:39:48] <toddmparker_> not sure if we need to get the height of headers/footers and use that to calculate a top/button padding on the content container?
[17:39:53] <toddmparker_> ya
[17:40:02] <garann> yeah, i think that's the only way
[17:40:28] <toddmparker_> yeah
[17:40:53] <toddmparker_> so I think the content div has 15px padding all around
[17:41:16] <toddmparker_> so we'd need to get the height of the header, tack on 15px to get the top padding
[17:41:33] <toddmparker_> issue with that is what if people overide the padding
[17:41:49] <garann> do we need to get the padding?
[17:41:58] <garann> of the content div
[17:42:04] <toddmparker_> actually, maybe using margin on cotnetn is beeter then
[17:42:20] <toddmparker_> kant spel
[17:42:24] <garann> ohhh, i see what you mean
[17:42:25] <garann> right
[17:42:38] <toddmparker_> yeah, think that's nicer
[17:42:55] <toddmparker_> sidestep the issue
[17:43:05] <garann> yeah margin seems better, although they could still override it
[17:43:09] <garann> seems less likely they would
[17:43:20] <toddmparker_> sure, but it's less likely
[17:43:49] <toddmparker_> i'm also trying to think ahead a bit for supporting the tap to hide behavior again
[17:44:07] <garann> yeah..
[17:44:34] <toddmparker_> if you have fixed toolbar, tap to hide, we could just set t/b margin back to 0 and it may be too jumpy
[17:44:39] <garann> since we're going to need js anyway,  i wonder if it's worth experimenting with having it be static initially and then switch to position:fixed only once the scroll past it?
[17:44:47] <toddmparker_> not sure, may look janky
[17:44:57] <toddmparker_> maybe that's the next thing to experiment with
[17:45:14] <garann> yeah, totally, but if we did that in conjunction with hiding it while they scroll..
[17:46:01] <garann> trying to think up a way to insulate us from the need to get the pixels perfect across all these devices :)
[17:46:15] <toddmparker_> right, that never ahppens
[17:46:25] <garann> haha
[17:46:50] <toddmparker_> so the concern is that a scroll is active and somehow a tap gets in there and it all goes to hell?
[17:48:15] <toddmparker_> i also wonder if we should tack a class on either the page or content container for when fixed toolbars are active. we have classes for the header/footers, but not their parents
[17:48:16] <garann> my concern would be a smooth transition between whatever positioning we use when the user is at the top of the page and what we use once they scroll down
[17:48:36] <toddmparker_> yeah, i see that
[17:49:12] <garann> active == visible?
[17:49:18] <toddmparker_> i think that if you're at the top and tap to hide you just see the blank spot where the toolbar was - currently anyway
[17:49:37] <toddmparker_> right - we might need to cover both cases
[17:49:52] <toddmparker_> sort fo depends on where we land with behavior and quirkiness
[17:50:23] <toddmparker_> i.e. fixed headers option is on, but they are hidden
[17:50:44] <toddmparker_> we might need to write styles differently in that case or others
[17:51:22] <garann> i think i'm a little confused about tap to hide
[17:51:29] <garann> do we do that now?
[17:51:51] <garann> and if so, is the tap a toggle, and does it persist like even if you scroll?
[18:00:21] <toddmparker_> garann, easiest if you play with the fixed page in 1.0
[18:00:45] <toddmparker_> but basically, once you tap, they stay hidden until you tap again
[18:00:52] <toddmparker_> sort of like the NYT app
[18:01:47] <eddiemonge> i hate basecamp
[18:02:06] <toddmparker_> i can un-invite you eddiemonge :p
[18:02:19] <toddmparker_> actually, garann - i was a bit wrong
[18:02:37] <toddmparker_> better to say that once you tap, they go back to inline
[18:02:50] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: have you tried asana?
[18:03:00] <toddmparker_> so the tap switches between fixed/absolute and inline
[18:03:03] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed.html
[18:03:13] <toddmparker_> nope, what's that?
[18:03:52] <eddiemonge> a better task list/project management
[18:03:58] <garann> got it, toddmparker_, that makes more sense
[18:04:09] <eddiemonge> everytime we've tried basecamp it gets forgotten
[18:04:22] <toddmparker_> yeah garann, also makes the positioning a bit less odd
[18:04:50] <toddmparker_> if we measure the height of the toolbars and tweak margin between modes, it should be pretty smooth
[18:04:59] <toddmparker_> or it could blink like hell on android
[18:05:13] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: asana looks cool
[18:05:18] <toddmparker_> but we're big BC users at filament
[18:05:37] <eddiemonge> it is. super simple but has all these cool hidden features i keep discovering
[18:05:49] <toddmparker_> this is just meant to capture email threads and share files
[18:06:00] <toddmparker_> most other things can happen here or on github
[18:06:16] <toddmparker_> we've lost some good info in the email black hole
[18:06:54] <toddmparker_> BC also does just enough and is visibile enough to be useful without imposing a lot of overhead
[18:07:01] <toddmparker_> lord knows it's not perfect
[18:07:59] <toddmparker_> garann - the "fullscreen" mode is more like what I described earlier. it literally toggles the toolbar visibility instead of position so they can be hidden
[18:08:26] <toddmparker_> they are also designed to sit *over* the content, like the iOS photo viewer controls

[18:54:35] <toddmparker_> it' sok reference these, but it's confusing as is
[18:54:58] <toddmparker_> i also don't think that this is part of the structural re-factor
[18:55:12] <eddiemonge> ok
[19:43:08] <toddmparker_> I added a few issues for 1.1 from the wiki page so we can track them: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1&milestone=11
