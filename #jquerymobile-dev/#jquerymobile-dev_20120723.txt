[00:55:12] <agcolom> gnarf? Hi, are you still here?
[00:55:24] <gnarf> yea
[00:55:50] <agcolom> Hi! not sure you know this, but it seems jquerymobile.com/test returns a 404
[00:57:01] <gnarf> hrm
[00:57:01] <gnarf> http://jquerymobile.com/test/index.html
[00:57:02] <gnarf> works
[00:57:09] <gnarf> lemme see if i can iron that one out
[00:57:19] <agcolom> cool. That's not so bad then
[01:01:19] <agcolom> there's a 403 on http://jquerymobile.com/branches/1.1-stable/js/
[01:01:57] <agcolom> btw what time is it for you??? Isn't it the middle of the night??
[01:04:22] <gnarf> 3am
[01:04:31] <agcolom> OMG!
[01:04:56] <agcolom> then you sleep all day I hope ;-)
[01:05:07] <gnarf> been working since ~9pm
[01:05:16] <gnarf> i'll probably be up until ~5pm
[01:05:24] <gnarf> another all nighter
[01:05:37] <gnarf> but i need like 24hr coverage to make sure to meet up with everyone on this damn project :)
[01:06:16] <agcolom> you've certainly managed that one ;-)
[01:15:13] <gnarf> agcolom: hows it look now?
[01:16:27] <agcolom> better... just one more thing
[01:16:50] <agcolom> not sure how to solve this one: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/1.1-stable/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.css
[01:17:25] <agcolom> it seems the import is not working, althought the links are correct...
[01:17:31] <agcolom> although ^
[01:17:54] <agcolom> so if you look at http://jquerymobile.com/branches/1.1-stable/index.html
[01:18:04] <agcolom> there is no style ;-(
[01:19:31] <uGoMobi> goodmorning
[01:19:33] <agcolom> if I type jquerymobile.com/test I get redirected to builder.jquerymobile.com/test
[01:19:38] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[01:19:40] <gnarf> hrm
[01:19:46] <gnarf> whats causing the redirect....
[01:19:51] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[01:20:04] <agcolom> not sure, is it what you just did?
[01:20:11] <agcolom> I never had this before?
[01:20:13] <uGoMobi> gnarf about that branch preview... view-source:http://jquerymobile.com/branches/1.1-stable/index.html
[01:20:27] <uGoMobi> the path to the js is incorrect
[01:20:46] <uGoMobi> so CSS is loaded, but the JS not
[01:22:54] <agcolom> gnarf: yes http://jquerymobile.com/branches/1.1-stable/js returns a 404
[01:23:28] <agcolom> but I think we had this before and johnbender fixed it...
[01:23:50] <agcolom> uGoMobi: does that ring a bell?
[01:24:05] <uGoMobi> Anne, no
[01:24:47] <gnarf> agcolom: so the redirect issue is fixed
[01:25:33] <agcolom> cool, thanks a lot :-)  the one to builder?
[01:27:49] <agcolom> very strange if I type http://jquerymobile.com/test or if I click on that link, I still get redirected to http://builder.jquerymobile.com/test but in the address bar, if I remove builder, it stays removed and I get http://jquerymobile.com!
[01:28:41] <gnarf> agcolom: probably cached?
[01:29:12] <gnarf> uGoMobi: so um
[01:29:17] <gnarf> i dunno where this index.html comes from
[01:29:20] <gnarf> or how its built
[01:29:25] <gnarf> or why the path is just /js/
[01:29:41] <uGoMobi> gnarf: I trying to figure that out because I don't know either
[01:31:25] <agcolom> I think this is where a php gets all the files??
[01:31:49] <gnarf> yeah
[01:31:54] <gnarf> it should be including index.php
[01:31:57] <gnarf> but its not working...
[01:32:10] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/build/branch-preview.sh
[01:32:27] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/index.php
[01:34:09] <agcolom> gnarf: yes cleared cache and I can confirm the redirect is fixed! Thank you :-)
[01:35:17] <agcolom> ok, kids are up (and on holiday) so have to be a mum for a bit :-)
[01:36:16] <gnarf> uGoMobi: lost...
[01:39:39] <uGoMobi> gnarf: yeah, me too
[01:41:26] <gnarf> agcolom: how old?
[01:41:43] <gnarf> the kids that is... :)
[01:41:44] <agcolom> 10 and 13 :-) so not too bad :-)
[01:43:34] <agcolom> yes, that php thing I remember that I raised it a while ago, and I am sure johnbender fixed it... or was it gseguin??? I'm trying to look at histories in github and basecamp....
[01:44:28] <uGoMobi> BTW - it's not the path that is wrong, it is that the filename is missing
[01:49:16] <agcolom> have to go for a bit...
[01:49:41] <uGoMobi> see you later Anne
[01:49:47] <gnarf> getting further....
[01:50:53] <uGoMobi> let's wait for johnbender or gseguin
[01:51:30] <uGoMobi> much more effective if they look into this
[02:00:52] <gnarf> i think i have that working
[02:00:56] <gnarf> at least that php part
[02:01:02] <gnarf> now there is something wacky with style still
[02:01:06] <gnarf> any thoughts?
[02:01:17] <gnarf> uGoMobi: i'd rather keep trying to fix things than set it down entirely
[02:01:40] <gnarf> plus, there isn't much else on my list
[02:02:48] <uGoMobi> gnarf: issue is still the same... script points to js/ instead of js/jquery.mobile.js
[02:02:58] <gnarf> it should point to js/
[02:03:00] <gnarf> it builds it
[02:03:03] <gnarf> via php
[02:03:05] <gnarf> which sucks
[02:03:12] <gnarf> got it fixed now tho
[02:03:53] <uGoMobi> ok, maybe cache issue...hang on
[02:04:27] <uGoMobi> gnarf: great, you fixed it indeed!
[02:04:45] <gnarf> now if i only had as much luck with testswarm :)
[02:09:40] <gnarf> can't figure out why it isn't saving run_results
[02:09:40] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/80675
[02:14:59] <uGoMobi> gnarf: seems like some parameters are missing in the url of that iframe
[02:15:08] <uGoMobi> http://swarm.jquery.org/index.php?action=result&item=80675&raw=
[02:17:59] <uGoMobi> or should it display all if "raw" doesn't contain a specific value?
[02:19:57] <gnarf> its just checking for presence of raw
[02:20:26] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[02:21:24] <gnarf> hah got it
[02:21:25] <gnarf> http://swarm.jquery.org/result/80747
[02:21:27] <gnarf> yays
[02:22:26] <uGoMobi> gnarf: great!!
[02:25:59] <gnarf> that one is annoying
[02:26:11] <gnarf> the database comlumn was set to "text" instead of "blob"

[06:39:44] <gseguin> good morning
[06:40:06] <gseguin> Thanks gnarf, uGoMobi and agcolom for bringing /test and /branches back to life
[06:40:08] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin
[06:40:36] <uGoMobi> credits go to gnarf !
[07:52:11] <toddparker> morning
[07:53:55] <uGoMobi> morning toddparker
[08:02:36] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I am done with the collapsibles... http://ugomobi.github.com/collapsibles/
[08:03:22] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I am going to push that to master instead of creating a PR if you don't mind
[08:15:59] <agcolom> good afternoon everyone :-)
[08:16:56] <agcolom> you're welcome gseguin. Thanks for the heads up gseguin and toddparker. That's when being in different timezones can be useful ;-)
[08:36:38] <toddparker> this issue was a waste of time. they guy had busted markup. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4731
[08:36:38] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4731 on jquery-mobile (LuisOsv; 2d, 18h ago): How can i put popup in the footer or header?
[08:36:47] <toddparker> thanks for closing already uGoMobi
[08:38:04] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yeah, he has a creative mind... data-role="popupfoot"
[08:38:10] <toddparker> heh
[08:38:16] <toddparker> looking at your list view stuff now
[08:39:08] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:39:10] <toddparker> looks nice
[08:39:27] <toddparker> did you update the docs to add this in?
[08:39:38] <toddparker> the new option and a blurb
[08:39:56] <uGoMobi> almost... only have to add an example to the collapsible set page
[08:40:15] <toddparker> yeah, that is probably the more important demo
[08:41:44] <toddparker> the 2nd inset demo is a common use
[08:41:51] <toddparker> like to have that example in the docs
[08:43:13] <uGoMobi> toddparker: are you talking about collapsible or collapsible set?
[08:43:19] <toddparker> that example of the 4 non-inset collapsible with various list view inside is really great too
[08:43:56] <toddparker> that one has individual collapsibles which is nice because we can explain that's how to allow multiple to be open at once, right?
[08:44:15] <toddparker> and we can say, if you want only one section open at once, use the collapsible set
[08:44:38] <toddparker> and we could use similar examples inside but that would auto-close when you open a new seciton
[08:44:55] <uGoMobi> I am not following... a collapsible set can't have multiple collapsibles being expanded at same time
[08:45:40] <toddparker> these test pages are all individual collapsible, right?
[08:46:14] <toddparker> oh, i see the inset set
[08:46:17] <uGoMobi> no, first couple are individuals... the last (with "set" above it) are sets
[08:46:54] <toddparker> so on the inset tab, the set of 4 with lists inside are a nice demo too
[08:47:03] <toddparker> i'd nix the inset filter tho
[08:47:52] <uGoMobi> yeah, that one was just because I had to fix the css for search filters
[08:48:01] <toddparker> that is just a nice demo in general
[08:48:21] <toddparker> we can basically show that inset or not, grouped or individual
[08:48:38] <toddparker> those 4 examples are pretty cool
[08:49:27] <uGoMobi> the problem with the first example on the "collapsible" page is supposed to be a bare example... not using theming and all
[08:50:10] <uGoMobi> I mean... it should just show the inset option
[08:51:08] <toddparker> looks like there were some alignment issues with lists inside collapsible in master
[08:51:11] <toddparker> just comparing now
[08:51:41] <toddparker> right. we can start with the simplest collapsible with that option
[08:53:16] <toddparker> be we can say after that simple example, "a common use for non-inset collapsibles is to nest full width list views inside to create an expandable list widget.
[08:53:55] <toddparker> i think that we could actually create a new list view docs page with this example and just cross-link to it
[08:53:58] <uGoMobi> yeah there were, but they should be gone after I pushed
[08:54:13] <toddparker> non-inset lists look odd in a running docs page
[08:54:33] <uGoMobi> yes I agree
[08:54:41] <toddparker> so on the collapsible page, we can just have a bare bones example and link across
[08:54:54] <toddparker> i think these richer demos belong with listviews
[08:55:39] <toddparker> so we would make two nice list view demo pages that use the same general markup but one is a series of individual collapsibles and another is a set
[08:55:52] <uGoMobi> maybe we need central example pages in general... so we add examples where multiple widgets are combined
[08:56:21] <uGoMobi> can*
[08:56:25] <toddparker> it would be cool to make more real-world demo pages like that
[08:56:45] <toddparker> list views already have forms and other widgets mixed in so there is a precedent
[08:56:56] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:57:17] <toddparker> think we can just add a P above the lists on both of those demos explaining what your'e seeing
[08:57:38] <toddparker> and they can link to the collapsible pages
[08:57:42] <toddparker> so we're cross-linking
[08:57:50] <uGoMobi> yes sounds good
[08:58:55] <uGoMobi> so that would be an extra page in the listview section? and a menu item "examples"?
[08:59:27] <toddparker> i'd add either one or two new list view pages
[09:00:17] <toddparker> maybe just one page
[09:00:32] <uGoMobi> actually almost all listview pages are example pages because the introduction text is on the listview landing page
[09:00:34] <toddparker> Collapsible, nested listviews
[09:00:41] <toddparker> yeah, exactly
[09:00:56] <toddparker> that could have a bunch of example
[09:01:14] <toddparker> one is a set of collapsibles fullowed by a blurb and the set version
[09:01:32] <toddparker> we can probably have the inset versions of these inline on the collapsible pages
[09:02:55] <uGoMobi> not sure about that last thing
[09:03:32] <uGoMobi> to explain how things work we just show simple examples there
[09:04:00] <uGoMobi> just setting one option each time
[09:11:27] <toddparker> yeah, agreed
[09:11:47] <toddparker> but there are more examples on the collapsible pages that are more real=world
[09:12:04] <toddparker> once you rough this out, i can hop in and see if i have any ideas
[09:12:18] <toddparker> i agree with your plan so far
[09:12:46] <toddparker> you really need to collect all your test pages into a folder that we link to from somewhere in the docs so we can browser everything
[09:12:54] <toddparker> awesome stuff
[09:19:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 18 new commits to master: http://git.io/XvurdA
[09:19:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Collapsible: JS code cleanup - Jasper de Groot
[09:19:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Collapsible (set): Added option inset. Adjusted CSS for inset collapsible (removed -8px margin) and added CSS for non-inset collapsibles. Fixes #3976 - data-inset option for Collapsible / Collapsible sets. - Jasper de Groot
[09:19:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Collapsible sets: fixed corner styling of legends as heading in a collapsible set. - Jasper de Groot
[09:19:51] <toddparker> BOOM
[09:19:56] <uGoMobi> :D
[09:21:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Guess what's causing the blinky transitions in iOS ...
[09:21:22] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #407: FAILURE in 1 min 7 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/407/
[09:21:30] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Don't worry about it, you'll never guess it. It's my use of <ol> on the popup/index.html page!
[09:21:54] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I comment out the ordered list, and Bam! No more transition issues ...
[09:22:07] * _|Nix|_ 's jaw is on the floor.
[09:24:56] <uGoMobi> and of course... a missing semicolon :(
[09:30:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: unbelievable!
[09:31:53] <uGoMobi> hmm... seems like only half of the options are listed on the collapsible set /options page
[09:43:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know - I also found it insane. This proves, however, that the popup is still vulnerable to markup choices, so maybe I need to revisit the animation sequence to make it more robust.
[09:43:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, I will first implement the reposition-upon-orientationchange thing, because that's the last missing feature. After that, it should all be debugging.
[09:44:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, better to have everything in first
[09:53:40] <toddparker> what? that's crazy _|Nix|_
[09:54:16] <toddparker> agreed to move on to the orientation
[09:54:33] <i-hate-dave> Yippie, build fixed!
[09:54:33] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #408: FIXED in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/408/
[09:54:42] <toddparker> so did you rencently change to an OL?
[09:55:02] <toddparker> nice catch uGoMobi
[09:55:10] <toddparker> did the tests not catch that?
[09:56:07] <uGoMobi> toddparker: that semicolon? no, because code is working. it is just the linter that doesn't like it.
[09:56:51] <toddparker> k
[09:58:19] <toddparker> there was a jenkins error that seemed to fix after you mentioned the semi-colon
[10:00:21] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes, first time tests failed because of that missing semicolon
[10:01:23] <toddparker> gotcha
[10:01:40] <toddparker> so _|Nix|_ that blink is because you have a OL on the _page_
[10:01:50] <toddparker> if you swap to UL, no blink??
[10:02:06] <toddparker> i thought it was used for the popup link or content to something
[10:02:08] <toddparker> so odd
[10:03:49] <johnbender> and we're back
[10:03:56] <johnbender> that was a long week
[10:05:56] <toddparker> hey johnbender
[10:05:58] <toddparker> welcome back
[10:06:03] <toddparker> how was the talk?
[10:09:30] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: so i changed that OL to a UL and it still blinks.
[10:09:43] <uGoMobi> hey John "globetrotter" Bender welcome back
[10:09:46] <toddparker> if i delete that list, no blink
[10:10:16] <toddparker> if i have an empty UL, no blink
[10:10:37] <toddparker> if there is even a single LI in the UL = BLINK
[10:10:58] <toddparker> Wilto or uGoMobi - any theories on that?
[10:11:46] <johnbender> toddparker: it went really well, lots of laughs
[10:12:09] <johnbender> I think people appreciated a talk that wasn't "we do data binding"
[10:12:21] <uGoMobi> toddparker: so it's not only with OL but also with simple UL's?
[10:12:26] <johnbender> toddparker: I also sold the crowd a bit on the parts of jqm  that require little commitment
[10:12:27] <uGoMobi> with a LI
[10:12:46] <toddparker> if i move that list higher up in the page, NO BLINK
[10:13:28] <toddparker> uGoMobi: yes, OL or UL with one or more LI's. Empty lists = no blink
[10:13:38] <toddparker> it's a source order thing
[10:15:22] <Wilto> oh hello
[10:15:51] <Wilto> Oh ho, and I am just in time for a weird one, looks like.
[10:17:18] <Wilto> _|Nix|_, toddparker: Is there a public-facing test for this blinkiness issue?
[10:19:34] <toddparker> my IP
[10:19:35] <toddparker> http://192.168.1.51:8888/jquery-mobile/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[10:19:47] <toddparker> only on ios
[10:19:58] <toddparker> tho on chrome i see the page scroll bit
[10:20:11] <toddparker> mat - scroll down to the transition examples
[10:20:19] <toddparker> you'll see a blink
[10:20:36] <toddparker> this only happens if that OL/UL a few PP's above is there
[10:20:52] <toddparker> if remove it or move the list to the top of the screen = no blinks
[10:21:15] <Wilto> Sounds like it’s related to http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html/2011Aug/0390.html
[10:22:47] <toddparker> hah
[10:26:43] <johnbender> we've got a semi missing in the collapsible
[10:26:48] <johnbender> line 101
[10:30:46] <SemicolonPolice> yeah that's more like it ... book em.
[10:31:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/76NaGg
[10:31:32] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Slider: Avoid regression by setting all margins of the slider handle. Fixes #4720 - Layout problem with toggle switch. - Jasper de Groot

[10:32:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: that was me... should be fixed already
[10:35:02] <Wilto> This… is a weird one.
[10:36:15] <uGoMobi> Hey I heard you like the weird ones
[10:36:23] <Wilto> You know that’s right.
[10:36:32] <uGoMobi> :D
[10:37:05] <gseguin> I'll take that conversation snippet out of context and tweet it
[10:37:13] <toddparker> there is no reason for that one
[10:37:25] <toddparker> i've tried a ton of permutations
[10:37:39] <toddparker> and it's only an issue if the list if near-ish to the popups
[10:37:52] <Wilto> Suffice to say: I ♡ this bug.
[10:38:10] <uGoMobi> I am sure the bug loves you too
[10:43:31] <johnbender> uGoMobi: cool
[10:44:28] <Wilto> gseguin: +1 to out of context tweeting, always.
[10:47:26] <_|Nix|_> Here's another: http://jsbin.com/orucec/3/ on iOS 5.1.1 ... notice the pink square only covers the window exactly when the address bar is showing.
[10:48:01] <_|Nix|_> So, if I want to use $( window ).{width,height.scrollLeft,scrollTop}() in my code, it's gonna be off on iOS ...
[10:48:21] <_|Nix|_> ... and it sure is ...
[10:48:57] <_|Nix|_> This is terrible ...
[10:53:42] <toddparker> gnarf: i hear you deserve hero status for moving our site over to the new servers. thank you so much.
[10:54:36] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: is that a timing thing? we try hide the URL bar on iphone
[10:54:48] <toddparker> do you see the bug on iPad where the address bar isn't hidden?
[10:55:16] <toddparker> checking now
[10:56:43] <toddparker> iPad looks right
[10:56:50] <toddparker> pink covers whole screen
[10:57:45] <toddparker> is this for positioning or something with orientation
[10:58:51] <toddparker> on iPhone, it is off. gives you the value with the url bar there
[10:58:59] <toddparker> but if you wanted a bit, might help?
[11:00:29] <Wilto> Hey _|Nix|_, any reason we couldn’t swing this backdrop thing with CSS? I think it’s doable.
[11:01:15] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: We /are/ swinging it with css ... I haven't used .animate() in a long time ...
[11:01:47] <Wilto> Oh, no, I just mean height/width/position.
[11:01:59] <Wilto> I’m tuning in late to this, of course — I’m just getting caught up.
[11:02:33] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Can you please be more specific?
[11:02:55] <Wilto> Where it’s absolute positioned, we could do `height: 100%; width: 100%` or `left: 0; right: 0; top: 0; bottom: 0;` on it, to ensure it fills the viewport. Might need some tweaking.
[11:03:08] <Wilto> But I am an old hand with this weird positioning stuff, if you want to tag me in for a bit.
[11:03:33] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: No, it's pretty serious: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/6724
[11:04:13] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: .ui-popup-screen already has 0, 0, 100%, 100% and it still needs this sizing, for some reason.
[11:04:37] <Wilto> It looks like it’s getting the static viewport height/width at the time it’s kicked in.
[11:05:12] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I've just commented that code out, and I'm about to test.
[11:05:27] <Wilto> Ah-hah, sorry. Like I said, just getting caught up!
[11:05:56] <Wilto> I’m wondering how it works if we set the page to `position: relative` and use `top: 0; bottom: 0;` on the backdrop.
[11:08:29] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: You may be right. Removing the code that sets the height for the screen might work.
[11:13:11] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Doesn't fix the blinkage though ...
[11:13:34] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Gets rid of some code, which is nice, but it still blinketh.
[11:14:11] <Wilto> Yeah; different beast, that.
[11:14:38] <Wilto> Help me get my bearings—where does all this live, at present? Is this in master?
[11:14:48] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Yes.
[11:15:11] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: docs/pages/popup/index.html ... click on the "Pop" transition example towards the bottom of the page.
[11:15:27] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Interestingly, if you click, like, slidefade first and then pop, pop will work.
[11:15:49] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: But, if the very first popup you invoke is the "pop" transition example, it blinks.
[11:15:56] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Same can be said for fade.
[11:16:12] <Wilto> Gotta re-clone this sucker; I’m the Mayor of Conflictowne right now.
[11:18:04] <Wilto> Gotta go grab a bite to eat, but I’m happy to help track this down when I get back. Not sure how much we can do about the blink.
[11:18:14] <Wilto> I’m feeling left out of jQM lately.
[11:18:24] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/sad-house.gif
[11:18:37] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I suspect it may have something to do with the way I shuffle classes upon .animationComplete()
[11:18:55] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I tried to, you know, not, but that didn't seem to fix it either.
[11:19:04] <Wilto> Hmm.
[11:19:49] <Wilto> I bet we could work around the blink with CSS Shenanigans™.
[11:20:22] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: ... of which you must be the Absolute Master™ ...
[11:20:52] <Wilto> I have been known to enjoy a good shenanigan or two.
[11:21:00] <Wilto> And to enjoy saying “shenanigans.”
[11:21:08] <Wilto> … “shenanigans.”

[11:50:14] <_|Nix|_> Why does iOS feel the need to zoom in when I switch from portrait to landscape? I don't get it.
[11:51:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: could that have to with focus?
[11:51:57] <uGoMobi> to do*
[11:52:48] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: This guy right here. http://scottjehl.github.com/iOS-Orientationchange-Fix/
[11:56:17] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Yaaaay!
[11:57:41] <uGoMobi> nice
[11:58:12] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Weird though, because it doesn't always happen. For example, if you open the basic popup in portrait and the switch to landscape, it works fine.
[11:58:29] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Do the same thing with the tooltip, and it'll zoom it in to show the tooltip.
[11:59:24] <Wilto> Huh.
[12:00:35] <toddparker> that's baked into jQM
[12:00:50] <toddparker> hmm
[12:00:59] <Wilto> Which iOS you in, _|Nix|_?
[12:01:00] <toddparker> i do think there is something off with focus
[12:01:07] <Wilto> If it’s the emulator, that fix won’t fire.
[12:01:45] <Wilto> It needs an accelerometer.

[12:15:35] <_|Nix|_> Man ... doing this orientationchange is not the least bit pretty. I have to 1. refocus the origin, to make sure it scrolls into view (unless the window is the origin, in which case I don't care), and 2. Place the popup over the origin once more. This is causing a boatload of jumping and flashing.
[12:18:31] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #411: FAILURE in 3.6 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/411/
[12:25:25] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: so this is only tricky for origin
[12:25:36] <toddparker> window is easy because re-flow isn't an issue
[12:25:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah.
[12:26:07] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I have to scroll the origin into view before I can reposition the popup.
[12:26:07] <toddparker> that sounds ugly
[12:26:19] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Doing it via .focus() doesn't look like the solution.
[12:26:36] <toddparker> that is a pain
[12:26:40] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I dunno if there's a better way to "make sure this element is in the window".
[12:27:34] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We could reduce the scope of our feature to center in the window upon orientationchange.
[12:27:54] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, basically, changing orientation, shakes a popup loose of its origin.
[12:28:00] <toddparker> what if we just popped up up centered to the window if you swap orientations
[12:28:06] <Wilto> It looks like resizing the window does the same.
[12:28:08] <toddparker> be nice if we flipped back
[12:28:24] <Wilto> I mean, you’d have to grab the offset of the origin during resize, which is gross.
[12:28:31] <toddparker> Wilto: what do you think? any ideas?
[12:29:02] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: gross indeed. I have found myself adding timeouts just to get things to calm down before I start grabbing offsets and sizes.
[12:29:08] <Wilto> That’s pretty much it, honestly. I don’t know any other way of keeping it relative to the trigger link.
[12:29:09] <toddparker> problem is that when i just tested on iPad, swapping Orientation completely scrolls the origin out of view
[12:29:25] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Exactly.
[12:29:26] <Wilto> Oh, I would absolutely throttle the resize.
[12:29:50] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I meant upon orientationchange.
[12:29:52] <Wilto> Or debounce altogther.
[12:30:01] <Wilto> Oh, the `resize` would catch that.
[12:30:13] <Wilto> I’d bind the recalculation to both resize and orientationchange.
[12:30:42] <toddparker> but do we try to keep the origin scrolled into view as you re-szie? seems messy
[12:30:53] <Wilto> Oh, God no.
[12:30:53] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah, that's insane.
[12:31:02] <toddparker> that's sort of the issue
[12:31:06] <Wilto> Yeah, that’d be horrendous.
[12:31:11] <toddparker> orientation and resize do similar things
[12:31:16] <Wilto> But then you end up looking at a backdrop with nothing attached.
[12:31:27] <toddparker> i think i'd vote to simply position to the window if either occur
[12:31:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: That's why I'm saying: Any resize or orientationchange or whatever, and you can forget about origin. It's window from that point on.
[12:31:42] <toddparker> so at least the popup is visible
[12:31:47] <toddparker> yeah
[12:31:49] <Wilto> Yeah, I like that.
[12:31:51] <toddparker> i'm in agreement
[12:32:02] <toddparker> this plugin is already complex enough
[12:32:03] <_|Nix|_> OK. Less state to keep around, too ...
[12:32:08] <toddparker> cool
[12:32:11] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah ... it's getting huge!
[12:32:22] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: A far cry from what we started out with :)
[12:32:26] <toddparker> saw that we've added some more code recently
[12:32:33] <toddparker> what were the heavy hitters there?
[12:32:42] <toddparker> those new options?
[12:32:44] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah, the position-to and tolerance options.
[12:32:49] <toddparker> right
[12:32:52] <Wilto> I bet it was those pesky semicolons.
[12:32:58] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:33:08] <Wilto> I remove them whenever I see them. Sometimes replace them with comma, since they’re half the size.
[12:33:31] <toddparker> my priorities are speed and simplicity so if we need to make tweaks, now is the time
[12:34:43] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: You know, that's an interesting point. One can conceive of a js compressor which is itself written in js and which treats the actual js code like a string, compresses it, and then, when you load the page, first the js uncompressor runs, and then it uncompresses the string and eval()s it.
[12:35:14] <_|Nix|_> ... and then the Universe collapses into a singularity :)
[12:35:21] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: http://wil.to/_/inception.png
[12:35:48] <toddparker> not that we're over-thinking or anything :)
[12:36:03] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: It'd make for a hell of a small d/l size.
[12:36:17] <Wilto> Then cram the whole thing into localstorage.
[12:36:30] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Or into a query param :)
[12:37:17] <Wilto> PUT IT IN A COOKIE
[12:37:34] <Wilto> So _|Nix|_, how can I help?
[12:37:50] <Wilto> Anything in particular need some CSS magic?
[12:39:05] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: If you can have a look at what I do with the <insert transition name here> in/reverse out classes during a transition, and find a smoking gun aimed at the blinkiness in iOS ...
[12:41:49] <Wilto> Sure thing.
[12:41:50] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I have this nagging suspicion that my removing the <insert transition name here> class when the popup is done opening may be causing the blinkiness in iOS ...
[12:42:15] <Wilto> So, this doesn’t follow the same class adding/removing pattern as the page transitions?
[12:42:26] <Wilto> I remember Scott’s refactor did a lot of good there.
[12:43:16] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: It does, for the most part, however, if you switch to another page while the popup is fading in or out, I have found that, when you return to the page containing the popup, the fading out continues when you revisit.
[12:44:05] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I was able to fix that by making transitions interruptible. I make them interruptible by yanking the transition name class.
[12:44:20] <Wilto> Ah.
[12:44:41] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: The presence or absence of that class should not make a difference once the popup is on the screen.
[12:45:02] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: ... since it doesn't affect any of the popup's appearance.
[12:47:00] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L389
[12:47:52] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: So, basically, once the popup has appeared by executing whatever transition, I set the classes up in such a way as to pretend that it has appeared using no transition, but simply using the removal off the ui-selectmenu-hidden class.
[12:48:05] <_|Nix|_> s/off/of/
[12:52:54] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: ... and indeed, when I comment out the body of that function, it works just fine ...
[12:53:14] <Wilto> For what it’s worth, things are buttery smooth in iOS 6.
[12:54:58] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Glad to hear that. Unfortunately, it looks like I have to once more take the ugly way out and only remove those classes if things get interrupted.
[12:56:25] <toddparker> makes sense
[12:56:40] <toddparker> how ugly exaclty?
[12:56:56] <Wilto> Yeah. I mean, that feels fringe-y anyway; jumping between pages in time to catch the end of a popup transition.
[12:57:30] <_|Nix|_> Not really. If the popup contains a link to another page, the popup starts fading out as you go to the other page.
[12:57:55] <_|Nix|_> Then, when you hit back, you see the popup fading out, even though in terms of its state and the DOM it's long gone.
[12:57:56] <Wilto> Which could impact the page transition.
[12:58:09] <Wilto> Hm, yeah. I follow you.
[12:58:23] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: That too. So, it's good to just axe the transition right then and there.
[12:59:33] <toddparker> now that the default is no transition, this is a bit less likely, though still something to think bout
[13:00:06] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah. This has to be done for correctness sake.
[13:00:36] <toddparker> this blinkiness with transitions is only with that UL/OL, right?
[13:01:04] <toddparker> i wonder if we can figure out how to make iOS behave instead of adding more code
[13:02:04] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Well, actually, I may be able to simply remove that code, because that code is only used when interrupting a popup as it opens.
[13:03:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, while it may be possible to go to a different page while a popup is in the process of opening and then coming back only to find that, while the actual internal state of the popup is that of being closed, the screen shows the popup opening and then disappearing.
[13:03:39] <toddparker> if we remove it, what do we do to cover the nav interruption?
[13:04:07] <toddparker> don't we already have some nav dependency
[13:04:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I got rid of that.
[13:04:28] <toddparker> yeah? great
[13:06:15] <toddparker> so the main issue is when you nav back and are returning to a page that had an open popup
[13:06:24] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The code I would yank, would not affect the immediate teardown of a popup that is in the process of closing.
[13:06:41] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, when you do go to another page, you'd still be finee.
[13:06:57] <toddparker> is it when you go back?
[13:07:12] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Is what?
[13:07:12] <toddparker> or just if you open a popup ad click a link inside it before the transition has finished?
[13:07:30] <toddparker> the code you think we can yank
[13:07:51] <_|Nix|_> "or just if you open a popup ad click a link inside it before the transition has finished?"
[13:07:58] <_|Nix|_> That's why I think it's safe to yank.
[13:08:19] <_|Nix|_> I mean, you'd have to have the reflexes of a cat to click a link inside a popup that's in the process of opening.
[13:08:37] <_|Nix|_> You'd have all of a quarter of a second to find the link and click it.
[13:08:45] <_|Nix|_> So, yeah ... unlikely.
[13:08:57] <_|Nix|_> I think /me go yank now.
[13:13:11] <uGoMobi> johnbender: do you know what that Jenkins error is about?

[13:48:59] <_|Nix|_> OK, so I have some initial repositioning code, but it's got lots of bugs. For example, if you open the dialog in portrait, switch to landscape and the back to portrait, "you're gonna have a bad time".
[13:49:33] <_|Nix|_> ... and seriously, the lack of a quick way to refresh the page on iOS is simply annoying.
[13:50:28] <_|Nix|_> Oh, and it totally doesn't work on Android ... yaaaaay! \o/
[14:01:23] <toddparker> hi agcolom
[14:01:28] <toddparker> i think spanish version is ok
[14:01:35] <toddparker> pretty clear
[14:01:43] <agcolom> hi :-) ok, will do that now.
[14:01:48] <toddparker> we're supposed to have a book site for jQ eventually
[14:01:52] <toddparker> a database of all books
[14:01:59] <agcolom> Excellent !
[14:02:41] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: yeah, that code is yank-able
[14:02:53] <toddparker> i thought it was for clicking links in a popup, then going back
[14:03:14] <toddparker> clicking a link in a popup before the transition is done is super edge case-y
[14:03:23] <toddparker> rather disable interaction until then
[14:11:31] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I don't think it has anything to do with us
[14:11:36] <johnbender> it's the git update script
[14:11:55] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, thanks
[14:12:48] <agcolom> toddparker: done. http://jquerymobile.com/resources/ I wanted to add one extra br before the spanish version, but when I do that, the font used for "Spanish version" becomes huge! not sure why??
[14:20:03] <uGoMobi> toddparker: using collapsibles as (auto)dividers for listviews would be cool new feature
[14:20:53] <agcolom> can we add count bubbles to collapsibles?
[14:20:54] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you suggested a count bubble for collapsibles, right?
[14:21:02] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:21:17] <agcolom> that was freaky!
[14:21:19] <uGoMobi> nice timing
[14:21:23] <uGoMobi> yeah :D
[14:21:44] <agcolom> I am speechless!!!!
[14:22:33] <uGoMobi> you mean the option to add a count bubble manually?
[14:23:25] <uGoMobi> if we use them for listviews we could possibly make it count the number of LI's
[14:25:16] <agcolom> that'd be nice
[14:25:36] <agcolom> I got the idea from the new weather app on iOS
[14:26:04] <uGoMobi> what info is in the count bubble?
[14:26:09] <agcolom> so I was thinking to even add 2 count bubbles (for min and max temperatures)
[14:27:06] <uGoMobi> aha, so not really count bubbles but more like a small area that contains info
[14:27:30] <agcolom> or if we can only have one, then anything can go in, so 12 / 37
[14:27:55] <uGoMobi> the problem is we have to know the size
[14:28:05] <agcolom> no, count bubbles as the one we have in lists
[14:28:06] <uGoMobi> or at least the max-width
[14:28:20] <uGoMobi> because we need to set padding
[14:28:25] <agcolom> you mean if we have 2?
[14:28:33] <uGoMobi> also with only one
[14:29:13] <agcolom> is it not just positioned from the right edge?
[14:29:16] <uGoMobi> right now we assume a max width of 35px
[14:29:47] <agcolom> really? I've used them with bigger than that I think....
[14:29:56] <agcolom> will post a picture...
[14:30:00] <uGoMobi> yes, absolute positioned from the right edge and padding-right to make sure the content and count bubble don't collapse
[14:30:56] <uGoMobi> as long as your text isn't using all the available space you won't notice anything
[14:31:15] <agcolom> ok
[14:33:07] <agcolom> uGoMobi: http://cl.ly/image/0P0309212d0H
[14:33:20] <agcolom> but the text before is short...
[14:34:53] <agcolom> is it so that we get the ellipsis ? (max width of 35px?)
[14:35:51] <uGoMobi> no there is no max-width on the count bubble
[14:36:10] <agcolom> I mean to the text before the count bubble?
[14:36:28] <uGoMobi> it is only that we counted a width of max 35px when setting the padding-right for the text in the element
[14:37:23] <uGoMobi> the count bubble is positioned absolute so that ignores any of the other content
[14:38:02] <uGoMobi> it's out of the flow so it's not bumping against text ot anything
[14:38:29] <agcolom> ok.
[14:39:11] <uGoMobi> I think using the count bubble for things like can be accomplished best with custom CSS
[14:39:25] <uGoMobi> because there are so many different use cases
[14:39:42] <agcolom> so if the text in the element is large, and the count bubble is more than 35px, they will end ond covering each other
[14:39:51] <uGoMobi> that it would be hard or maybe even impossible to set rules for it in the framework CSS
[14:40:01] <agcolom> yes, that's fine.
[14:40:29] <uGoMobi> yes that's correct
[14:41:25] <toddparker> uGoMobi:  Oh yeah - using collapsibles as (auto)dividers for listviews would be cool new feature
[14:41:30] <uGoMobi> but I agree it is nice to have a small info bubble
[14:41:46] <agcolom> but do you think it'd be possible to support count bubbles in collapsible headers provided teh bubble is less than 35px? (then if people want it bigger, they'll have to add some css)
[14:42:06] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yeah, not easy to create but very useful feature
[14:42:34] <toddparker> yeah
[14:43:01] <toddparker> as long as the bubble styles weren't scoped against the list view markup, you could drop them into collapsibles
[14:43:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that would be possible... one issue is we support right icon position as well
[14:43:29] <toddparker> features tend to get tricky like that
[14:43:31] <agcolom> ah yes, that'd be a problem
[14:43:51] <agcolom> I'd say, no bubbles if the icon is right
[14:44:04] <agcolom> ?
[14:44:08] <uGoMobi> or bubble left if icon is right
[14:44:18] <agcolom> yes, why not
[14:45:14] <uGoMobi> toddparker: right now I am adding one "collapsible list" page to the listview folder
[14:45:17] <toddparker> or we just tell people "don't' do that"
[14:45:27] <toddparker> cool…was just going to ask
[14:45:39] <toddparker> the simple examples in collapsibles are nice
[14:45:51] <uGoMobi> what should I put on that one... inset styled collapsible set with non-inset listviews inside?
[14:45:52] <toddparker> once you get that page in, we can link to it from there
[14:46:06] <toddparker> for the name in the nav?
[14:46:22] <uGoMobi> no, what kind of examples
[14:46:28] <toddparker> ah
[14:46:30] <uGoMobi> I name "collapsible list"
[14:46:49] <toddparker> i'd do a non-inset list on top
[14:47:10] <toddparker> well, maybe start with the inset as you suggested
[14:47:36] <toddparker> yeah
[14:47:49] <uGoMobi> you suggest multiple collapsible (sets) on that page or one collapsible set with different listviews in it?
[14:47:52] <toddparker> 1. inset with individual collapsibles
[14:48:05] <toddparker> 2. inset with collapsible set
[14:48:14] <toddparker> 3. full width version or one/both?
[14:51:09] <toddparker> just add a paragraph above each explaining what's going on
[14:52:33] <uGoMobi> toddparker: when you say "inset" does that refer to the collapsible (set) or the listview inside it?
[14:53:02] <uGoMobi> sorry, too much "inset" today ;)
[14:56:07] <toddparker> ah
[14:56:12] <toddparker> the collapsible
[14:56:23] <toddparker> all lists are nom-set to look snazzy
[14:56:33] <toddparker> non-inset
[14:57:18] <uGoMobi> ok clear, thanks
[14:57:18] <toddparker> we can tinker with one example to change the icons to the arrows and theme
[14:57:24] <toddparker> the first could be fairly default
[14:57:26] <toddparker> cool
[14:59:00] <uGoMobi> see the navmenu here http://developer.vimeo.com/apis/advanced/methods
[14:59:26] <uGoMobi> you can also accomplish that with JQM collapsibles with listviews
[14:59:47] <uGoMobi> only problem is we can't deep link inside a document yet :(
[15:00:14] <toddparker> i really want to fix that
[15:00:29] <toddparker> that's nice
[15:00:35] <uGoMobi> you have to scroll that page to see it
[15:00:44] <toddparker> the docs could have a left nav that is collapsible
[15:00:52] <toddparker> linking to different pages
[15:00:55] <uGoMobi> yeah, was thinking the same
[15:00:59] <toddparker> but it would be slick
[15:01:12] <toddparker> we could include in one nav and just set on states
[15:01:22] <toddparker> think this is a really nice feature
[15:01:36] <toddparker> like working on what we have to make it more useful
[15:02:27] <uGoMobi> yeah... that fact that you can dynamically collapse/expand a collapsible is not even in the docs yet
[15:02:36] <uGoMobi> so many things you can already do
[15:03:07] <toddparker> right. we should add demos for that
[15:03:09] <uGoMobi> that Vimeo navmenu is great for tablets
[15:03:17] <toddparker> we need more demos that use scripting
[15:03:20] <toddparker> i bet
[15:03:48] <toddparker> since 1.2 has been so long in the works, i need everyone's help to figure out what's new to highight
[15:04:51] <uGoMobi> yes, we should really look into all ideas on the feature request page and on the forum
[15:04:57] <uGoMobi> and our own ideas
[15:05:15] <uGoMobi> probably need to update that planning/roadmap wiki page
[15:12:00] <toddparker> starting to add notes here
[15:12:01] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.2-blog-post
[15:12:14] <toddparker> please help my jot jotting down fixes and features
[15:12:45] <agcolom> autodividers and page loading widgets are also 1.2
[15:13:28] <uGoMobi> read-only lists restyling, popup, autodividers, padding controlgroup icon-only buttons, fieldcontain forms 60% → 78% (together with label) full width, all buttons default to mini/inline in toolbars
[15:16:54] <uGoMobi> would be nice if GitHub added search tool for commits
[15:17:11] <uGoMobi> add a*
[15:17:59] <toddparker> autodividers!
[15:18:03] <toddparker> wow, been a while
[15:18:12] <agcolom> toddparker: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/checkbox/
[15:18:22] <agcolom> all examples are in :-)
[15:18:53] <agcolom> (well on the checkbox that is!) but shouldn't take long now to do the rest...
[15:19:40] <johnbender> toddparker: what's the plan for 1.2?
[15:21:20] <toddparker> johnbender: we're still ironing out some kinks with the popup but that will hopefully be in good shape in the next day or two
[15:21:30] <toddparker> i wouldn't mind having you give it a once over again
[15:21:40] <toddparker> after that, we're in good shape for 1.2 alpha
[15:22:03] <toddparker> i've just started notes for the blog and mauriceG has been collecting commits
[15:24:20] <toddparker> i'd like to get this out later this week
[15:25:52] <johnbender> cool
[15:26:10] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm recovering today, but I'll probably get back into the testswarm stuff
[15:26:20] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm also going to ask jorge about stealing some time to work on my idea

[15:31:13] <toddparker> uGoMobi: a few Q's
[15:31:17] <toddparker> refresh my memory
[15:31:18] <toddparker> icon-only buttons were used in controlgroups
[15:31:25] <uGoMobi> go ahead
[15:31:34] <uGoMobi> yes correct
[15:31:34] <toddparker> is there a way to get back to the tighter style? mini?
[15:31:49] <uGoMobi> yes, mini is supported
[15:31:54] <toddparker> cool
[15:32:17] <toddparker> i'll have to add that example
[15:32:55] <uGoMobi> could add mini grouped icon-only buttons at the bottom of this page http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-grouped.html
[15:33:31] <toddparker> excactly
[15:33:35] <toddparker> i can't spell
[15:34:01] <toddparker> probably should add mini at the end here too
[15:34:02] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-icons.html
[15:34:09] <toddparker> i can do some of that stuff as i go
[15:34:23] <toddparker> Buttons in toolbars: Now mini by default
[15:34:38] <toddparker> i thought that the two links were always mini
[15:34:50] <toddparker> so this is just for input and button elements?
[15:35:23] <uGoMobi> we want all buttons regardless of markup default to mini and inline inside toolbars
[15:35:42] <agcolom> what will be the next version? I couldn't cherry-pick MauriceG last PR because of conflicts in the list docs (autodividers are only coming in 1.2)
[15:37:22] <uGoMobi> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3998
[15:37:23] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3998 on jquery-mobile (H2Os; 3m, 1w ago): <button> and <a> different font size in footer
[15:37:48] <toddparker> right uGoMobi - but links in header have always been button + mini
[15:37:58] <toddparker> we're just applying this to buttons and inputs now
[15:38:01] <toddparker> and form elements?
[15:38:21] <toddparker> agcolom: i hope to get alpha out later this week for 1.2
[15:38:23] <uGoMobi> not all form elements are mini
[15:38:27] <toddparker> we can move quickly thru RCs
[15:38:40] <toddparker> uGoMobi: ok, so just the input and buttons
[15:39:04] <agcolom> toddparker: excellent! So that would be built from master and not 1.1-stable, right?
[15:39:04] <uGoMobi> yes, this fix regards button-styled elements only
[15:39:17] <toddparker> ok
[15:39:24] <toddparker> agcolom: yes, master
[15:39:30] <toddparker> = 1.2
[15:39:35] <agcolom> Fantastic!!!!!
[15:39:36] <toddparker> uGoMobi: fieldcontain forms 60% → 78% (together with label) full width
[15:39:48] <uGoMobi> yeah, that's a bit cryptic ;)
[15:39:52] <toddparker> yeah
[15:39:54] <toddparker> forgot
[15:40:12] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3301
[15:40:13] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3301 on jquery-mobile (semoi; 7m, 4d ago): field 60% width
[15:41:22] <toddparker> riiight
[15:42:15] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone...
[15:42:33] <uGoMobi> summary: form elements in fieldcontain were not full width @media min-width 450px
[15:42:39] <uGoMobi> now they are
[15:42:43] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[15:42:54] <toddparker> so labels are still 20% and now forms take up most of the rest
[15:42:58] <agcolom> toddparker: if you get a chance, please check the demos at http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/checkbox/
[15:43:12] <uGoMobi> labels 20% + 2% margin
[15:43:18] <uGoMobi> form element 78%
[15:43:19] <toddparker> those are great agcolom!
[15:44:07] <agcolom> thanks :-) will add the other demos for the other widgets then using the same style
[15:44:35] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper!
[15:44:51] <uGoMobi> toddparker: BTW - that fix for buttons inside toolbars default to mini is picked for 1.1.2. as well
[15:45:00] <toddparker> ok, we have a lot of stuff so far - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.2-blog-post
[15:45:01] <toddparker> please help me track down all the goodies
[15:45:09] <toddparker> uGoMobi: cool
[15:45:10] <uGoMobi> but those release notes will be used for alpha, right
[15:45:15] <toddparker> yes
[15:45:22] <toddparker> tho it seems to be missing some
[15:45:25] <uGoMobi> ok so that comes first
[15:45:27] <toddparker> i just emailed maurice
[15:45:37] <toddparker> yes, 1.2 before 1.1.2
[15:45:44] <toddparker> but we can do 1.1.2 in a few weeks
[15:45:54] <toddparker> esp. since we missed that cordova fix
[15:46:00] <uGoMobi> the active state for collapsibles?
[15:46:24] <uGoMobi> I think that isn't in 1.1.1.
[15:46:39] <agcolom> there will be a 1.1.2 as well??
[15:47:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, that's why you are still cherry-picking in 1.1-stable
[15:47:10] <uGoMobi> at least... I hope you are :)
[15:48:01] <agcolom> yes I am :-) but I had a conflict with Maurice's last PR
[15:48:10] <uGoMobi> this is going to be so confusing: 1.1.1. > 1.2.alpah > 1.1.2. > 1.2
[15:48:22] <agcolom> (lists have autodoviders coming n 1.2)
[15:48:24] <uGoMobi> alpha even
[15:48:39] <uGoMobi> yes, autodividers is 1.2
[15:48:53] <uGoMobi> 1.1.2. will just be bug fixes like 1.1.1.
[15:48:57] <agcolom> so changes to lists with that menu item will cause a conflict...
[15:49:16] <agcolom> wondering whether I need to make that change manually then...
[15:49:33] <agcolom> or if otherwise it should wait for 1.2
[15:49:50] <uGoMobi> I dunno which PR it is about
[15:51:28] <agcolom> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/80665a22e2d53873916e42e07905a36663e2307e
[15:51:28] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Anne-Gaelle Colom (23m, 43s ago): Merge pull request #4685 from MauriceG/patch-28  Docs: Refine the paragraph about split buttons to be more informative (docs-lists.html)
[15:51:40] <toddparker> we can make manual fixes into 1.1-stable if that's easier. jeu the sure to reference the issue and whoever made if the fix originally
[15:52:41] <agcolom> yes, will do that... these are small word changes... there's also the change from color scheme to color theme whill I will change back to color scheme...
[15:52:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it seems to be only one conflicting paragraph
[15:52:57] <toddparker> i'm heading home just will be working on the blog post
[15:53:10] <uGoMobi> ok, goodnight todd
[15:53:12] <toddparker> i'll look thru 1.2 tickets for other highlights
[15:53:16] <toddparker> goodnight all!
[15:53:19] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, but all was in a single PR
[15:53:26] <agcolom> Goodnight Todd!
[15:53:32] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes I see
[15:53:41] <toddparker> agcolom: i'd just copy paste the change over and give credit
[15:53:47] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but I can cherry-pick it and then solve the conflict
[15:53:54] <uGoMobi> by just leaving that paragraph out
[15:54:01] <toddparker> i hope that 1.1.2 will be one of the last maintenance releases for 1.1.x
[15:54:04] <toddparker> but we'll see
[15:54:06] <agcolom> uGoMobi: If you can, that'd be great!
[15:54:15] <toddparker> g'night
[15:54:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sure
[15:54:32] <agcolom> Thank you!
[15:54:34] <uGoMobi> later toddparker
[15:54:50] <agcolom> then tomorrow I'll change color theme back to color scheme...
[15:55:31] <uGoMobi> ok, I'll just pick it in 1.1 and then you can make other changes if needed
[15:55:43] <agcolom> ok, cool!
[15:56:16] <agcolom> Thank you very much! It is bedtime for me...
[15:56:38] <uGoMobi> goodnight (again)
[15:57:08] <agcolom> Goodnight again too :-)
[15:57:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: one sec
[15:57:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that color scheme is just in the last file, right?
[15:58:12] <uGoMobi> color theme (swatch) --> color scheme (swatch)
[15:59:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I will do a search and replace for that in list-options
[17:22:37] <gnarf> agcolom: is it my turn to ask if you're still up? :)
[17:25:58] <gnarf> toddparker: dunno if its possible to be a hero when you were the one that broke everything in the first place ;)
[17:26:23] <gnarf> toddparker: although I did rescue your website from a "burning building"
[17:26:25] <gnarf> ;)
[17:34:59] <uGoMobi> gnarf: everything is working like a charm so we are all very happy with you :)
[17:35:08] <uGoMobi> gnarf: thanks again!
[17:36:28] <uGoMobi> gnarf: are you done with this huge project?
[17:38:09] <gnarf> the moving seems done
[17:38:13] <gnarf> at least for the EOL stuff
[17:38:19] <gnarf> back to the other HUGE project ;)
[17:38:54] <uGoMobi> gnarf: which one is that?
[17:39:43] <gnarf> getting all the websites into the wordpress deployment
[17:39:58] <uGoMobi> aha... right
[17:40:46] <uGoMobi> that's indeed a HUGE one
[17:41:39] <uGoMobi> don't forget to plan some sleep in between :)
[17:42:00] <gnarf> yeah - i was having trouble keeping my eyes open last night
[17:42:16] <uGoMobi> I can imagine
[17:42:16] <gnarf> or this afternoon
[17:42:25] <gnarf> whichever it is depends on perception i guess
