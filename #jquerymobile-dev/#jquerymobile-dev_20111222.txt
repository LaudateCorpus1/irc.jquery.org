[06:32:37] <toddmparker_>  good morning
[07:44:29] <Wilto> Thanks, TehShrike|Work. It accurately represents where I’m at, professionally: thinking about sweet SNES games.
[08:51:04] <gseguin> good morning
[08:51:08] <Wilto> Count it:
[08:51:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto created left-iconpos (+3 new commits): http://git.io/mWv8ug
[08:51:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/left-iconpos] Allow to define on li the data-iconpos="left". Very useful when used with rtl languages. - Rémi Dewitte
[08:51:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/left-iconpos] Merge branch 'patch-1' of https://github.com/remidewitte/jquery-mobile into left-iconpos - Mat Marquis
[08:51:16] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/left-iconpos] Added unit tests for listview link icon positioning. - Mat Marquis
[08:51:31] <gseguin> w00t!
[08:51:34] <Wilto> Baby’s First Unit Test, right there.
[08:51:47] <Wilto> Printing that sucker out and hanging it on the Filament Group fridge.
[09:01:07] <Wilto> So, that left-iconpos branch is ready for review/merging, methinks. Dunno if anyone wants to test that business first—toddmparker_?
[09:01:24] <toddmparker_> sure
[09:02:05] <Wilto> Not a hell of a lot to it, obviously.
[09:07:49] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/ysAUyg

[09:24:41] <Wilto> WHEW DODGED A BULLET ON THAT ONE
[09:28:29] <toddmparker_> public service announcement:
[09:28:46] <toddmparker_> NO JQUERY MOBILE MEETING TODAY OR NEXT WEEK
[09:29:57] <gseguin> k
[09:34:27] <imjoshdean> Wilto: Done.
[09:34:56] <Wilto> Hey guys, imjoshdean might take care of the button() vs. buttonMarkup() normalization a day this week.
[09:35:32] <imjoshdean> Don't listen to his lies.
[09:35:40] <imjoshdean> Oh wait...he's telling the truth for once.
[09:35:45] <Wilto> Just this once.
[09:56:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 5 new commits to amd: http://git.io/TDcE6w
[09:56:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] Added dep on buttonMarkup - Ghislain Seguin

[10:24:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do we have the meeting today at a 11? I was going to join if we did
[10:32:02] <gseguin> johnbender: no meeting today
[10:32:17] <gseguin> nor next week
[10:32:18] <johnbender> :(
[10:32:30] <johnbender> gseguin: are you working on jqm today?
[10:32:34] <gseguin> yep
[10:32:42] <gseguin> I just pushed
[10:32:48] <johnbender> gseguin: shweet
[10:33:17] <gseguin> so we have 3 more test suites to take care of
[10:33:23] <johnbender> gseguin: nice!
[10:33:29] <gseguin> I started working on the event one
[10:33:40] <johnbender> nightmares
[10:33:41] <johnbender> lol
[10:33:43] <gseguin> it's really weird what's happening
[10:33:51] <johnbender> feel free to just avoid that one
[10:33:55] <johnbender> nightmares
[10:34:05] <gseguin> ok, good
[10:34:45] <gseguin> I rewrote testHelper.reloadLib to use requirejs' context
[10:37:55] <gseguin> johnbender: are you working on jqm today?
[10:38:57] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm hanging around
[10:39:09] <gseguin> k
[10:39:10] <johnbender> gseguin: I thought I'd help with finishing up the amd thing
[10:39:24] <gseguin> yeah that would be great to wrap it up
[10:39:27] <johnbender> gseguin: so with a new context will it reload the dependencies too?
[10:39:34] <gseguin> yes
[10:39:39] <johnbender> makes sense
[10:39:48] <johnbender> otherwise they wouldn't a facility for it
[10:39:57] <johnbender> wouldn't *have* a facility for it
[10:41:05] <johnbender> gseguin: so what's left beside event?
[10:41:14] <johnbender> navigation and ....
[10:41:19] <gseguin> core
[10:41:28] <johnbender> ah
[10:41:45] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll take a crack at nav
[10:41:51] <johnbender> but core and event can be left alone
[10:41:52] <gseguin> k
[10:41:56] <gseguin> I'll look at core
[10:42:04] <johnbender> that's another harry one
[10:42:12] <johnbender> reload :/
[10:42:34] <gseguin> oh wait
[10:42:39] <gseguin> core is working
[10:42:41] <gseguin> heh :D
[10:43:01] <Wilto> johnbender: No meeting today or next week.
[10:43:17] <johnbender> gseguin: git log -p tells me I did it yesterday :P
[10:43:21] <johnbender> Wilto: cool
[10:43:45] <gseguin> johnbender: that's right!
[10:44:20] <gseguin> shit so all that's left is event
[10:44:34] <johnbender> gseguin: hell yah
[10:44:36] <gseguin> that one's a b*#ch
[10:44:44] <johnbender> don't worry about it
[10:44:48] <johnbender> seriously
[10:44:50] <johnbender> just skip it
[10:44:55] <johnbender> maybe throw in a todo
[10:45:09] <johnbender> the only point here was to determine the dependencies
[10:45:13] <gseguin> actually there are just 2 of them failing
[10:45:18] <gseguin> I'll comment them out
[10:45:36] <johnbender> gseguin: ?
[10:45:37] <johnbender> the tests?
[10:45:42] <gseguin> yeah
[10:58:22] <johnbender> gseguin: I'd rather leave them in there and skip the asyncload tbh
[10:59:21] <gseguin> johnbender: so not use requirejs for that one?
[10:59:41] <johnbender> gseguin: yah if the choice is between removing tests and using require I'd rather keep the tests
[11:00:01] <johnbender> we should revisit those test suites at some point but I don't think that's now
[11:00:16] <gseguin> ok
[11:00:31] <gseguin> so we have to shim define() then
[11:04:21] <johnbender> gseguin: yerp
[11:07:56] <abu> is there a meeting today ?
[11:08:14] <gseguin> abu: no meeting today or next week
[11:08:24] <abu> ah ok. happy holidays folks
[11:08:30] <johnbender> abu: you too sir!
[11:08:33] <abu> don't do anything  wouldn't :)
[11:08:33] <gseguin> to you too
[11:23:28] <johnbender> gseguin: the best part about running these tests in iframes will be that I can scroll down to see the results :P
[11:28:02] <johnbender> gseguin: everything but the transition test are green on nav
[11:28:22] <gseguin> woohoo!
[11:31:13] <toddmparker_> hey all
[11:31:14] <Wilto> Breaking: I screwed up some git stuff after all.
[11:31:24] <toddmparker_> ruh roh
[11:31:35] <Wilto> Nothin’ big.
[11:31:43] <johnbender> Wilto: whats up?
[11:32:14] <Wilto> Oh, just shuffled some stuff around. Some half-baked fetchlink tests in the iconpos branch, for example.
[11:32:18] <Wilto> Have it patched up shortly.
[11:38:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to left-iconpos: http://git.io/cN-tCA
[11:38:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/left-iconpos] Updated docs, removed half-baked fetchlink unit tests. - Mat Marquis
[11:39:14] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender - do you have a sec to respond to elliot re: the listview autodividers
[11:39:16] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3302#issuecomment-3247687
[11:39:17] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by townxelliot (3d, 2h ago): Add autodividers functionality to listview
[11:39:17] <Wilto> Don’t mind me.
[11:41:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sure thing
[11:42:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: actually wanted to talk to you about how we want sergey to proceed but it seems like something that might have to wait until after the holiday?
[11:44:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: responding now
[11:44:21] <johnbender> to townxelliot
[12:02:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: responded
[12:13:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: thoughts on responding to sergey?
[12:13:54] <johnbender> I can respond on what *I* would like him to do but that doesn't mean that's the right thing for him to do
[12:18:27] <johnbender> gseguin: I doubt I'm going to finish navigation today
[12:18:29] <johnbender> :(
[12:18:55] <johnbender> gseguin: my wife is expecting me to help pack for the trip tomorrow
[12:27:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Hey! I noticed you started a new branch called popup.
[12:27:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: I'm having some trouble pushing a new commit to my pull request (#3308) ... I fixed a link in the documentation, but the pull request doesn't pick up the additional commit ...
[12:28:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Should I rebase my popup update onto the popup branch?
[12:48:53] <toddmparker_> hey _|Nix|_
[12:49:04] <toddmparker_> that is where the code should go for sure
[12:49:26] <toddmparker_> johnbender: can you suggest the best way for _|Nix|_ to apply changes in this situation?
[12:49:56] <toddmparker_> (johnbender or gseguin) are great Git people to ask Q's about.
[12:52:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/LlE6jg

[13:05:07] <gseguin> johnbender: no problem
[13:06:02] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: looking
[13:07:49] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: that pull is against dialog-refactor which Wilto renamed yesterday I believe
[13:08:34] <gseguin> you need to create another one against popup
[13:09:28] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Doing it now.
[13:15:30] <_|Nix|_> gseguin, toddmparker_: Made a new pull request (#3322) against popup.
[13:16:03] <gseguin> Thanks _|Nix|_
[13:16:15] <toddmparker_> thanks!
[13:16:33] <toddmparker_> gseguin - you mind doing the honors if bender isn't around?
[13:17:11] <gseguin> sure, Wilto might know that code better but I'll take a look
[13:17:22] <Wilto> I know so precious little. Whassup?
[13:17:40] <gseguin> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3322
[13:17:41] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (3m, 13s ago): Popup update
[13:18:12] <toddmparker_> appreciate the help on popup _|Nix|_
[13:18:22] <toddmparker_> this is going to be a killer feature
[13:18:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Alright ... glad to help :)
[13:18:49] <toddmparker_> did you see the other little demos i added to the docs page
[13:18:57] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Sure did ...
[13:19:04] <toddmparker_> you can make a menu, lightbox, form, etc really easily with this
[13:19:17] <toddmparker_> one thing you may be able to help with is tweaking the positioning a bit
[13:19:18] <Wilto> Hm, something is amiss.
[13:19:23] <toddmparker_> seemed to be a bit off
[13:19:30] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: What was the deal with the IE .filter thing?
[13:19:31] <toddmparker_> unless you tackled that in this pull
[13:19:44] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: IE8 does not have it.
[13:19:53] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I was getting all kinds of errors ...
[13:20:03] <Wilto> I think something else is afoot, there.
[13:20:13] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: and IE8 is, well, shall we say, unreliable when reporting errors.
[13:20:15] <Wilto> .filter() should be okay in all the IEs—that’s a jQuery thing.
[13:20:17] <Wilto> Oh, no doubt.
[13:20:35] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: That may well be the case, considering how bad its error reporting is.
[13:20:58] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: But it was <string>.filter(), not <jQuery object>.filter() ...
[13:21:09] <_|Nix|_> Or, rather, sorry, <array>.filter() ...
[13:21:47] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: did you just end up rebasing onto Wilto's new branch?
[13:23:05] <Wilto> Oh, I think we have a IE-corrected indexOf in play, don’t we?
[13:23:07] <Wilto> You could use that there.
[13:23:09] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: would $.grep help?
[13:23:18] <johnbender> just double checking that you're all set
[13:23:28] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #351: SUCCESS in 11 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/351/
[13:23:29] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jakeboone02: Move back button configuration options to Page section
[13:23:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_:
[13:23:34] <_|Nix|_> 			    coords = this._placementCoords(
[13:23:35] <_|Nix|_> 			    	(undefined === x ? window.innerWidth / 2 : x),
[13:23:35] <_|Nix|_> 			    	(undefined === y ? window.innerWidth / 2 : y));
[13:23:44] <Wilto> Anyway, that’s all that’s jumping out at me in here—minor thing, y’know, especially if it’s working as-is.
[13:23:45] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: That was the problem - fixed now.
[13:24:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Cut 'n paste error :-S
[13:24:39] <bhuber> is anyone here working on the css-fixed branch?
[13:24:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I rebased onto Todd's new branch called "popup", AFAICT.
[13:25:13] <bhuber> i'm trying to use the css-fixed branch to fix some nasty scrolling issues in iOS 5
[13:25:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool, I'm assuming that worked out then (I have no idea what the common ancestor is between the two branches but it must be sane)
[13:25:35] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: It's alright. I can avoid .filter() by looping over the members of the array.
[13:25:46] <bhuber> it's working admirably for that, however, now my footers always disappear and reappear again during page transitions
[13:26:01] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: .filter can be replaced by $.grep
[13:26:20] <bhuber> i've replicated this footer-flickering on http://filamentgroup.com/tests/jqm-nativefixed/docs/toolbars/footer-persist-c.html in chrome, so it's probably not something I'm doing wrong
[13:26:39] <bhuber> does anyone have any ideas about how to fix this, or what might be causing it?
[13:27:02] <Wilto> I blame Scott.
[13:27:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Aha ... OK ... Is it important enough to update the pull request?
[13:27:22] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: No worries; I’ll pull this in as-is, and we can patch it up after the fact.
[13:27:29] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: OK.
[13:27:42] <Wilto> johnbender: Saw your rebase question above—should I hold off for any reason? Seems like this is pretty well constrained.
[13:27:44] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Great!
[13:27:45] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: no I was just saying
[13:27:47] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: cool that's fixed
[13:28:09] <gseguin> So Wilto, you press the button?
[13:28:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Of course, in IE8 all the popups show up at the top of the page, so I'll still have to have a look for IE8 ...
[13:28:23] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/button.gif
[13:28:37] <johnbender> Wilto: what was rebased onto what? I'm confused now
[13:28:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 7 new commits to popup: http://git.io/QgIFBA
[13:28:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup] [popup] Make sure the screen and the container have a higher z-index than any other element on the page - Gabriel Schulhof
[13:28:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup] [popup-docs] "#popupTester" has gone missing, breaking the theme inheritance demo - restore - Gabriel Schulhof
[13:28:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup] [popup] Cleanup: data-options and this.options.* options need no longer be merged by hand - Gabriel Schulhof
[13:28:41] <toddmparker_> bhuber: the fixed toolbars are still in an early experimental state
[13:28:55] <Wilto> johnbender: “_|Nix|_: did you just end up rebasing onto Wilto's new branch?”
[13:28:58] <toddmparker_> so we haven't yet worked on how they interact with transitions
[13:29:04] <bhuber> ic
[13:29:10] <toddmparker_> (we're re-working transitions too)
[13:29:34] <toddmparker_> so fixed is still pretty early to be using, but it is tempting because it's slick
[13:29:43] <johnbender> Wilto: it seems like a good idea if you guys changed the branch onto which his commits should be applied
[13:30:10] <toddmparker_> also, we haven't finished the device targeting. some browers will crash and burn, we still need to exclude them
[13:30:11] <Wilto> Oh, no, haven’t changed anything in a bit. Seems okay.
[13:30:27] <johnbender> k
[13:30:34] <bhuber> yeah, right now it seems i'm stuck between the choice of being able to scroll and momentarily flashing footers
[13:30:43] <toddmparker_> yup
[13:30:58] <toddmparker_> but we're working hard on getting fixed into good shape
[13:31:07] <toddmparker_> it will be pretty solid in a few weeks
[13:31:12] <bhuber> good to know
[13:31:18] <bhuber> thanks for the info toddmparker_
[13:31:26] <toddmparker_> np bhuber
[13:58:23] <johnbender> gseguin: python -m SimpleHTTPServer works brilliantly
[13:58:28] * johnbender is stoked
[13:58:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^^
[13:58:49] <gseguin> for ?
[13:58:52] <johnbender> amd
[13:58:54] <johnbender> with amd
[13:58:57] <gseguin> the tests?
[13:59:01] <gseguin> oh yes
[13:59:01] <johnbender> the docs
[13:59:19] <johnbender> making it easier for people to hack on the library is, imo, an enormous win
[13:59:28] <gseguin> absolutely
[13:59:34] <johnbender> especially given all the awesome contributions we're seeing
[13:59:41] <eTiger13> easier than what?
[14:00:02] <Wilto> Pie.
[14:00:15] <johnbender> eTiger13: easier than apache + php
[14:00:20] <Wilto> I’m not good at relevant answers; sorry.
[14:00:41] <gseguin> lol
[14:00:57] <eTiger13> requires python though
[14:01:02] <johnbender> os x comes with python preinstalled
[14:01:09] <eTiger13> also comes with php preinstalled
[14:01:12] <Wilto> I did not know that.
[14:01:14] * johnbender double checks that
[14:01:17] <toddmparker_> nice gseguin
[14:01:27] <gseguin> eTiger13: not completely true
[14:01:28] <toddmparker_> and johnbender
[14:01:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: seriously
[14:01:47] <eTiger13> comes preinstalled, but not turned on.
[14:01:49] <Wilto> I’m pretty mad at all you guys got not using my handy ?objection shortcut during this debate.
[14:01:52] <gseguin> eTiger13: you have to enable php5 on osx it's disabled by default
[14:02:03] <gseguin> ?objection
[14:02:04] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/objection.jpg
[14:02:04] <eTiger13> are we requiring php5?
[14:02:23] <Wilto> Thank you, gseguin.
[14:02:32] <gseguin> did I type php5?
[14:02:53] <eTiger13> yeah
[14:02:57] * gseguin 's hands don't listen to his brain
[14:03:06] <gseguin> I meant php
[14:03:11] <gseguin> gotta run to a meeting
[14:03:16] <gseguin> be back in a few
[14:04:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Figured out the problem with placement in IE8: I was using window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight instead of $(window).width() and $(window).height() ...
[14:04:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Fixed in #3323
[14:05:04] <toddmparker_> cool, thanks _
[14:05:09] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_:
[14:06:03] <toddmparker_> looking at the new code, I don't think that z-index lookup is going to be critical for us. I'd rather have a good set of z-index rules for sensible stacking so we can handle this in CSS
[14:06:17] <toddmparker_> could be very slow to run that z-index checker code
[14:06:30] <Wilto> Seconded.
[14:06:31] <toddmparker_> might make sense for your project though
[14:09:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK. Feel free to yank it.
[14:11:08] <_|Nix|_> I think I'm'na hit the hay ... it's midnight over here :) L8R, y'all!
[14:11:23] <Wilto> Later on, man. Thanks for the help.
[14:13:00] <toddmparker_> thanks _|Nix|_
[14:13:05] <toddmparker_> great stuff
[14:52:04] <Wilto> Man, writing unit tests is actually pretty entertaining.
[14:53:16] <Wilto> He said tragically.

[15:43:19] <destryalhmns> hello?
[15:43:30] <destryalhmns> can anyone give me a little help?
[15:43:53] <destryalhmns> hi danzik
[15:44:11] <eddiemonge> with?
[15:46:16] <destryalhmns> i cant get <meta name="viewport" content="blah" /> to work https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3558031?start=0&tstart=0
[15:54:27] <eddiemonge> destryalhmns: ask in #html
[15:55:43] <destryalhmns> you mean the people who are trying to learn what <p> is?
[15:55:53] <gseguin> eddiemonge: I left in a hurry, sorry
[15:56:19] <eddiemonge> destryalhmns: this is a channel for jquery mobile development. and thats more of a html issue. well actually a webkit issue
[15:56:34] <eddiemonge> gseguin: no problem. i came in halfway through the conversation
[15:58:10] <destryalhmns> well i would think someone in jquer mobile would have some experience with the tag
[15:59:58] <destryalhmns> because im using the tag in a jqm app
[16:00:17] <Wilto> Nothin’ personal destryalhmns—but you might want to check out #jquerymobile for help with general jQM app development.
[16:00:20] <destryalhmns> like, i need to get current "dimensions" and with all of the zooming and what not
[16:00:37] <Wilto> destryalhmns: This channel is just for the sake of the jQM development team to sync-up.
[16:00:51] <destryalhmns> im sorry did i join the condescending channel?
[16:01:01] <destryalhmns> oh
[16:01:12] <destryalhmns> i thought it was for anyone who develops in jqm
[16:01:31] <gseguin> destryalhmns: that would be #jquerymobile
[16:01:39] <destryalhmns> okay then
[16:01:40] <destryalhmns> ...
[16:01:46] <Wilto> Yeah. No worries.
[16:01:48] <destryalhmns> you guys know page transitions dont work, right
[16:02:21] <Wilto> I’ve heard some things to that effect, yes. Thanks.
[16:02:41] <destryalhmns> yeah, big time bad
[16:03:03] <Wilto> Pull requests are more than welcome!
[16:04:08] <destryalhmns> this was spawned from like a year long thread https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3217
[16:04:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3217 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (2w, 3d ago): Page transition re-think: Smoother, faster
[16:04:26] <destryalhmns> yep
[16:04:48] <destryalhmns> so you guys actually develop jqm code?
[16:08:12] <Wilto> destryalhmns: If the transitions are tripping you up on your current project, keep in mind that they can be disabled by setting defaultPageTransition to “none.”
[16:08:21] <Wilto> See http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0/docs/api/globalconfig.html
[16:08:33] <destryalhmns> yeah thats not a real problem, we have them turned off and obviously they are working on it
[16:08:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 2 new commits to amd: http://git.io/IQlzAg
[16:08:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] Remove .js suffix from libName - Ghislain Seguin
[16:08:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] Expose jquery.mobile as an AMD module if running in an AMD env - Ghislain Seguin
[16:08:54] <eddiemonge> they?
[16:09:07] <destryalhmns> the flip transition is awesome though, that will be really cool when it finally gets working
[16:09:24] <destryalhmns> they, you, no one ever answered my question... the fine people at jqm
[16:09:56] <Wilto> …You’re still in the jQM developer channel.
[16:10:12] <destryalhmns> allright then ill leave you all be, keep up the good work
[16:10:18] <Wilto> Thanks.
[16:10:43] <Wilto> Ah well.
[16:13:13] <gseguin> Is there a way $.extend can be non destructive?
[16:13:15] <eddiemonge> that was .... awkward
[16:13:29] <Wilto> I got a strict rule about fighting on the internet:
[16:13:47] <Wilto> “You can’t invite people to step outside, so it’s not like it’s gonna go anywhere.”
[16:14:03] <gseguin> :)
[16:14:18] <Wilto> I’m sure they had good intentions. Movin’ on.
[16:14:56] <gseguin> Wilto, eddiemonge: is there a way $.extend can be non destructive?
[16:15:10] <eddiemonge> you could create an empty object as the first param
[16:15:51] <gseguin> so if I do $.extend( {}, obj1, obj2 )
[16:16:03] <eddiemonge> var newObj = $.extend({}, ob1, ob2)
[16:16:19] <gseguin> and I have obj1.foo and obj2.foo, which one ends up in target?
[16:16:43] <eddiemonge> the right most one i think
[16:16:57] <gseguin> easy enough to test
[16:17:08] <gseguin> thanks eddiemonge
[16:18:47] <gseguin> that's right
[17:32:33] <gseguin> here we go:
[17:32:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 3 new commits to amd: http://git.io/O_PUNA
[17:32:42] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/amd] Added $.testHelper.deferredSequence - Ghislain Seguin
