[05:37:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/out-in-transition] special case for dialogs - the theme class will apply to the page container when a dialog is shown, and that class will be removed when the dialog is hidden. This allows the transition to appear to affect only the inset window portion of the dialog page. - scottjehl
[05:37:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/out-in-transition] By caching the href value to data and switching the href to a #, we can avoid address bar showing in iOS on every click. The click handler resets the href during its initial steps if this data is present. Note that the address bar will still likely drop down when you click the browser's back button. The only time the back button will not drop the address bar  appears to be when the back button doe

[07:10:35] <toddmparker_> gseguin - you around?
[07:10:43] <toddmparker_> have some AMD Q's
[08:24:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I was going to work on getting sergey's changes merged in, but I'm happy to try and answer for you

[08:30:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/out-in-transition] if there's an overlay theme, we're going to remove it from the page container. First though, check that the incoming page isn't a dialog with the same overlay theme. If so, don't remove the class, as it'll remove it for the next one too - scottjehl
[08:51:01] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:51:15] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I'm here now
[08:55:37] <johnbender> gseguin: this toddmparker_ guy is always off on concalls and other "non jqm" business
[08:55:47] <johnbender> silly really
[08:55:56] <johnbender> :/
[08:55:57] <gseguin> :)
[08:56:33] * johnbender thinks those quotes should have included business
[09:10:43] <johnbender> I'm thinking about submitting a new talk to OSCOn
[09:11:13] <johnbender> "Progressive Enhancement on the Mobile Web: Don't Try This at Home"
[09:12:18] <johnbender> detail the (sometimes ugly) ways the jqm does PE to include devices, how PE and a nice ux aren't mutually exclusive, and why people should choose frameworks
[09:12:26] <johnbender> anyone have thoughts?
[09:18:35] <johnbender> kinblas: I'd like to get people educated on the "it's all webkit myth"
[09:18:40] <johnbender> as a side effect
[09:19:10] <kinblas> that would be great!
[09:19:21] <johnbender> kinblas: yah, it feels like a talk with legs
[09:19:39] <johnbender> just waiting to see if I can get my hands on my qcon panel video
[09:26:27] <imjoshdean> johnbender: Ten minutes later, I'd listen to that talk
[09:26:43] <johnbender> imjoshdean: thanks!
[09:27:57] <imjoshdean> I wish more people would understand that, that PE and a nice UX can't coexist
[09:28:31] <imjoshdean> Similar to how "pixel perfect" boils my blood.
[09:28:51] <johnbender> imjoshdean: I'm definitely going to note our weak spots that are a result of the PE approach
[09:29:15] <imjoshdean> s/can't/can
[09:29:17] <johnbender> to do otherwise would be disengenuous
[09:29:32] <johnbender> but in large part it's doable
[09:29:56] <imjoshdean> Yes it is, sorry gave the wrong impression. You can do both.
[09:31:12] <kinblas> imjoshdean: you meant a nice *native* UX?
[09:32:06] <imjoshdean> Let me try this again from scratch
[09:32:44] <imjoshdean> I wish more people would understand that, that you can have PE and a nice UX, period.
[09:37:36] <gseguin> johnbender: for some reason Basecamp emails were landing in my spam folder
[09:37:39] <gseguin> catching up
[09:44:15] <johnbender> Wilto: you around?
[09:46:54] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: I'm working on getting sergey's changes merged in
[09:47:17] <johnbender> tests are passing but I spotted what looks like a css issue on master
[09:48:48] <Wilto> oh god internet i have missed you so
[09:49:02] <Wilto> What’d we miss? Is jQuery Mobile finished?
[09:49:57] <kinblas> johnbender: great! It would be great to get final numbers (improvement) from him so Todd can blog it
[09:50:42] <johnbender> kinblas: yah getting the perf numbers rolling is going to take a while I think
[09:50:59] <johnbender> hmm
[09:51:01] <johnbender> well maybe not
[09:51:13] <johnbender> I'm assuming I'll have to add some other than the startup time ones he created, but I might not
[09:51:42] <kinblas> johnbender: I think it was *some* startup and some *show* improvements
[09:51:46] <johnbender> Wilto: the state dialog in the docs on Master has "Switch theme" in the middle of the second button in Chrome
[09:52:02] <johnbender> kinblas: yah so the "show improvements" need to be measured
[09:55:28] <Wilto> johnbender: Shenanigans. I will look into it, sir.
[10:00:15] <johnbender> Wilto: mind you I'm running 15
[10:00:31] <johnbender> I'm not sure what the latest is
[10:05:41] <Wilto> johnbender: Yeah, I’m seeing it here. Probably something minor.
[10:06:47] <Wilto> I’m also gonna see about letting Firefox 10 into 3D Transform Towne.
[10:12:30] <gseguin> Good morning jrburke
[10:12:40] <gseguin> I'm working on merging your branch
[10:12:41] <jrburke> howdy gseguin
[10:12:42] <bot-t> (90 hours 10 mins ago) <gseguin> tell jrburke: I checked in the changes for the filter you can test it out: http://amd-builder.no.de/jqm-jrburke/issue_3386-2/make?baseUrl=js&include=jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup&filter=../build/wrapDefine.js ... pure awesomeness!
[10:12:51] <gseguin> thanks bot-t
[10:12:52] * bot-t sighs
[10:13:22] <jrburke> cool!
[10:13:47] <gseguin> hey jrburke did you see @jashkenas' decision to pull out the AMD layer from Underscore?
[10:14:07] <jrburke> gseguin: no i have not yet, just getting started on the day
[10:14:31] <jrburke> gseguin: you have a link?

[10:15:50] <gseguin> stand-up time, brb
[10:28:09] <gseguin> back
[10:42:44] <toddmparker_> hi all
[10:47:15] <toddmparker_> johnbender: that talk sounds great, thanks for looking at sergey's changes too
[10:47:44] <toddmparker_> hey guys - our web was out
[10:49:08] <toddmparker_> the theme wswitcher is odd
[10:49:19] <toddmparker_> it's been MIA for months and jsut recently popped back up everywhere
[10:49:29] <toddmparker_> i think we can nix that from teh docs
[10:49:38] <toddmparker_> sorry for all teh typoz
[10:50:49] <johnbender> :D
[10:51:54] <gseguin> toddmparker_: still have questions for me or did that get answered in the basecamp thread?
[10:52:16] <toddmparker_> think the Q's from scott were more articulate :)
[10:52:26] <toddmparker_> all set gseguin
[10:53:55] <Wilto> Yeah, Im’ma nuke the theme switcher, as long as no one will especially miss it.
[10:55:58] <toddmparker_> BOOM
[11:02:48] <Wilto> Time for my weekly new Firefox beta!
[11:13:02] <jrburke> gseguin: does it help if i do a pull request with my changes, or has it been easy enough to just manually pull the changes into your own branch?
[11:13:31] <gseguin> I pulled your branch locally and merge master onto it
[11:13:39] <gseguin> resolved the conflicts
[11:14:15] <jrburke> gseguin: ok cool
[11:15:36] <gseguin> I like having a lighter syntax and getting rid of the inner IIFE but I still would love a solution that requires only r.js with no post-processing
[11:15:41] <gseguin> jrburke: ^
[11:17:55] <jrburke> gseguin: i figured that since there is post-processing anyway, in particular with the version stamping (that can be part of that filter), then it seemed cleaner. i'm not sure how i would do generic support, say as an r.js option. jquery mobile is a bit specialized since it does not use module references, has things attached to jquery, so it does not need the local module references, but most other module code does need the mod
[11:17:55] <jrburke> refs
[11:18:14] <jrburke> so removing the dependency array/functions would not be good for those setups
[11:19:25] <gseguin> absolutely
[11:20:20] <gseguin> Oh yeah the version stamping...
[11:24:36] <johnbender> gseguin: Wilto: docs are broken with simple server
[11:24:39] <johnbender> ie without php
[11:24:54] <gseguin> oh really?
[11:24:57] <johnbender> it's a css issue from cbebd882652c8bb59c880155ad3fa929b540f7ad
[11:25:03] <Wilto> Aw hell.
[11:25:05] <johnbender> `git show cbebd882652c8bb59c880155ad3fa929b540f7ad1`
[11:25:10] <johnbender> it's expecting the php in that case
[11:25:19] <johnbender> were you guys going to move to imports?
[11:26:02] <Wilto> Waaait a sec.
[11:26:12] <Wilto> There should be a commit after this that corrects it. One sec…
[11:26:14] <gseguin> following up on scott's remarks, I'm going to add a whole project optimization for the docs
[11:26:50] <johnbender> Wilto: it might be that I need to update my branch
[11:26:58] <johnbender> though I thought I did before merging sergey's issues
[11:26:59] <gseguin> so docs will still be using requirejs but will pull a built bundle instead of each module
[11:26:59] <johnbender> err
[11:27:02] <johnbender> pull request
[11:27:02] <Wilto> Yeah, there’s a commit in there correcting it.
[11:27:10] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/148cb09132dfca601de7b1215ab3903067f803ab
[11:27:11] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Wilto (21h, 51m ago): Updated docs’ CSS to use new @import scheme.
[11:27:11] <johnbender> Wilto: alright lemme check
[11:32:51] <gseguin> johnbender: works pretty well with the whole project optimization: http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/compiled/
[11:33:40] <gseguin> that means that /latest would have to run a Makefile target, is that possible?
[11:37:24] <gseguin> johnbender: did you get my last message?
[11:39:04] <gseguin> Also if there are no objections I'm going to land jrburke's changes on master ( https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/jquery:master...jrburke:issue_3386-2 )
[11:39:53] <gseguin> Wilto: ^ that change will require you to add an argument to the call to /make in the bundle builder

[11:55:19] <johnbender> gseguin: what did you guys come up with in terms of the replacement?
[11:55:39] <johnbender> are we just going to add a rhino js script?
[11:56:24] <gseguin> replacement for?
[11:56:46] <johnbender> gseguin: or are we just going to include the define shim
[11:56:52] * johnbender keeps wanting to type "shiv"
[11:57:01] <johnbender> maybe I should look at the pr ...
[11:57:52] <gseguin> yeah shim it with a function: def

[11:58:31] <Wilto> Most productive thing I’ve done today.
[12:00:39] <johnbender> gseguin: what's the advantage of replacing define with def, just compression?
[12:01:14] <gseguin> no just that it doesn't interfere with an AMD loader if one is loaded
[12:01:29] <johnbender> hmm
[12:01:38] <johnbender> yah we're sort of stomping on the global namespace a bit there
[12:01:40] <gseguin> I'm guessing
[12:02:20] <gseguin> nope cause all that is wrapped in an IIFE
[12:02:25] <gseguin> look at wrap.start
[12:03:29] <johnbender> gseguin: then we're worried about someone creating another define somewhere in our library?
[12:03:50] <johnbender> ah
[12:03:51] <johnbender> nevermind
[12:04:08] <johnbender> hrm
[12:04:29] <gseguin> no but if you're using an amd loader define will be defined
[12:05:11] <johnbender> right
[12:05:30] <johnbender> gseguin: do we know what the extra weight is with the module definitions left in?
[12:06:07] <johnbender> it seems like a whole lot of chicanery to replace the define wrapped iife
[12:06:21] <johnbender> trading simplicity for code cleanliness
[12:07:07] <gseguin> can I pick that up after lunch? they're leaving without me
[12:07:18] <gseguin> be back in a few
[12:07:20] <johnbender> NO FOOD!
[12:07:21] <johnbender> lol
[12:07:23] <johnbender> for sure
[12:23:50] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[12:23:51] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #385: FIXED in 10 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/385/

[12:23:52] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Removed themeswitcher in docs.
[12:41:46] <johnbender> Wilto: cool that sorted the issue
[12:43:15] <Wilto> The Firefox thing? I was just about to ask.
[12:43:49] <Wilto> Or the obliteration of the themeswitcher?
[12:49:44] <Wilto> Hm. I wonder if I should remove that on every page, or just throw all kinds of 404s all over the place like a dumbass.
[12:49:50] <Wilto> I will reflect on this. While fixing it.
[12:52:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/G4DTGg
[12:52:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed reference to themeswitcher JS docs-wide. - Mat Marquis
[12:52:40] <Wilto> There we are.
[12:53:18] <gseguin> and we're back
[12:58:07] <gseguin> johnbender: the weight we gain or loose is a matter of a few bytes
[13:07:09] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I'm worried more about the added complexity
[13:07:42] <johnbender> gseguin: everything we've done up to this point is relatively straight forward
[13:07:49] <johnbender> at least from my perspective
[13:07:50] <gseguin> jrburke: ^
[13:08:20] <johnbender> or, rather it's the least complex option to achieve our ends
[13:08:48] <gseguin> so one thing that we need that jrburke adde is express our dependency on jQuery
[13:09:00] <jrburke> well sure, you don't have to do the dependency removal, i was doing that because i thought you all wanted them removed.
[13:09:15] <jrburke> but i can redo the patch so that it does not do the rewriting
[13:09:43] <gseguin> so it would just shim define if it
[13:09:46] <jrburke> and still keep it so that the local define does not interfere with a global/amd define
[13:09:47] <gseguin> 's not there?
[13:10:10] <jrburke> yeah, have an internal shim, like def is now with just a small tweak to function def(){}
[13:10:43] <johnbender> jrburke: and we need to wrap the build output too to prevent a conflict right?
[13:11:08] <johnbender> sorry, the diff looked like it was attempting to keep the defines but rename define -> def
[13:11:14] <gseguin> one thing that would be great is see how many bytes we gain with the defines not stripped compared to what we have today
[13:11:28] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm totally fine with keeping the defines
[13:11:36] <johnbender> it's the extra build complexity I'm not sold on
[13:11:59] <johnbender> we've added a ton of extra stuff to just get rid off the iife's, or at least that's my perception
[13:12:09] <jrburke> ok, yeah if the defines are kept, the the r.js wrap config can be used to add wrap.start and wrap.end
[13:12:11] <johnbender> s/to just get rid of/just to get rid of/
[13:12:16] <gseguin> oh then we have a deal because r.js supports adding a wrapper
[13:12:42] <johnbender> gseguin: jrburke: in that case would we still rename define to def ?
[13:12:56] <gseguin> no
[13:13:09] <johnbender> but we'd still have the wrappers
[13:13:17] <gseguin> just shim the define function if no AMD loader is present
[13:13:43] <gseguin> johnbender: define wrappers
[13:13:51] <jrburke> right it gets to be very easy then, just tweak the functon def() in wrap.start to be function define() {} and do a small change inside that shim function
[13:14:12] <johnbender> I'm pretty sure I'm not following what you guys want to do now
[13:14:34] <johnbender> :(
[13:14:55] <johnbender> compare view is probably easier than describing it
[13:14:59] <jrburke> johnbender: it would just be sort of a concat of the source files then (but in correct dependency order) with the wrap.start and wrap.end prepended/appended
[13:15:15] <jrburke> with no modifications of the source files' define() calls
[13:15:34] <gseguin> but then we have version stamp issue
[13:16:01] <gseguin> though we can still do post-processing just for that
[13:16:06] <johnbender> jrburke: ignoring the version issue, the wraping is just to prevent namespacing problems?
[13:16:52] <jrburke> johnbender: the wrapping in wrap.start ? yes, but then also sets up the define() call correctly with a jquery dependency if the file is loaded by an amd loader.
[13:17:24] * johnbender needs a compare view
[13:18:20] <jrburke> sounds good. i can do a branch, gseguin: what code should I use as the baseline? you have a public branch somewhere? or, feel free to do it too, just happy to help
[13:18:57] <gseguin> I can push my current merge branch
[13:19:03] <gseguin> let me do that
[13:19:34] <jrburke> i'm going to get lunch, but i'll do the branch this afternoon
[13:19:40] <jrburke> when i get back
[13:20:18] <gseguin> sounds good
[13:21:01] <gseguin> et voila!

[13:25:13] <Wilto> johnbender: That hashchange issue was specific to both Firefox and dialogs, yeah?
[13:25:18] * johnbender wants to kill the base tests for firefox :(
[13:25:27] <Wilto> Speak of the devil.
[13:25:29] <johnbender> Wilto: yah, that's fixed
[13:25:37] <Wilto> Where’s that at? I think I’m seeing it.
[13:25:40] <johnbender> Wilto: sorry no
[13:25:43] <Wilto> Where’s that fix at.
[13:25:45] <johnbender> it's not
[13:25:49] <Wilto> Oh, hm.
[13:25:50] <johnbender> its in pushstate
[13:25:52] <johnbender> in master
[13:25:58] <johnbender> it's not at all specific to firefox
[13:26:03] <Wilto> Oh, hm.
[13:26:10] <Wilto> Something is amiss in out-in-transition.
[13:26:14] <johnbender> it only manifests in our builds because the hashchange was slow, and it was firing after our arbitrary timeout
[13:26:24] <Wilto> Ahh.
[13:26:44] <johnbender> Wilto: let me find the commit and you can revert it to see if it's causing you an issue

[13:39:43] <johnbender> Wilto: different after reverting?
[13:40:17] <johnbender> Wilto: as a side note it really shouldn't have anything to do with the transitions
[13:40:41] <johnbender> it uses the same machinery that regular old hashchange uses

[13:59:56] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/issue-3386-2] Don't post-process the output of r.js, just wrap the output of r.js to export as an AMD module if AMD loader present, shim the define function otherwise - Ghislain Seguin
[14:00:49] <gseguin> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/issue-3386...issue-3386-2
[14:01:18] <gseguin> the patch jrburke|away was talking about ( I think )
[14:02:01] <gseguin> wait a minute! where is are my Makefile changes?
[14:02:47] <gseguin> there they are
[14:03:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to issue-3386-2: http://git.io/ww_LfQ
[14:03:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/issue-3386-2] Don't post-process the output of r.js, just wrap the output of r.js to export as an AMD module if AMD loader present, shim the define function otherwise - Ghislain Seguin
[14:10:29] <johnbender> gseguin: ok, so that's what I thought we'd be doing
[14:10:39] <johnbender> basically is just does a simple define shim
[14:11:11] <gseguin> let's wait for jrburke to return and merge that down to master
[14:11:33] <johnbender> I guess I'm still not a huge fan of the build wrapper though I'm under the imression that's relatively standard
[14:11:39] <johnbender> does core do something like that
[14:11:56] * johnbender searches through the murky haze of his memory
[14:12:11] <gseguin> yeah you have to, to conditionally export the AMD module
[14:12:35] <gseguin> core does something similar
[14:14:10] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm fine with it, I would just compare the build size then
[14:14:27] <gseguin> yup on my way to do that
[14:16:24] <johnbender> gseguin: I would put those numbers in a quick basecamp message and let people weigh in. The general gist of this is "define factory becomes the iife"
[14:16:44] <johnbender> so it's simpler and paves the way for better amd support later
[14:19:56] <gseguin> yeah not stripping the defines costs 4K
[14:20:03] <gseguin> in minified
[14:22:55] <johnbender> hmmm
[14:23:04] <johnbender> well
[14:23:31] <johnbender> I would say toake it to basecamp, but that seems like a fair amount of extra weight
[14:23:37] <johnbender> s/toake/take/
[14:39:47] <Wilto> johnbender: No, something else is amiss.
[14:41:55] <johnbender> Wilto: awright, let me know if you need hel
[14:41:59] <johnbender> *help
[14:42:32] <johnbender> gseguin: we might just end up saving that pr/change until we actually want to provide modules
[14:42:52] <toddmparker_> johnbender: what is the url for our unit tests?
[14:43:02] <johnbender> in which case we need to just embrace the define anyhow
[14:43:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: which one?
[14:43:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the whole suite tends to fail by itself under /test/unit
[14:43:25] <johnbender> err
[14:43:33] <johnbender> rather the event tests tend to fail there
[14:43:40] <toddmparker_> sorry
[14:43:49] <toddmparker_> don't we have a url like http://jquerymobile.com/test/unit
[14:43:49] <gseguin> johnbender: just posted my observations on basecamp
[14:44:14] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/unit/ :D
[14:44:30] <toddmparker_> ah-ha!
[14:44:30] <toddmparker_> thanks
[14:45:03] <toddmparker_> does that really test latest master?
[14:47:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: as long as it's up to date
[14:47:10] <johnbender> why?
[14:47:26] <toddmparker_> oh, the nokia guys were asking
[14:47:35] <toddmparker_> they wanted to run our tests on some of their devices
[14:47:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ah, mind you we don't run any of that on devices
[14:47:45] <johnbender> I have no idea how it will behave
[14:52:37] <jrburke> gseguin: i'm back now. right, your changes in the 3386-2 branch were what I was thinking, although i thought jquery.mobile.init needed to be in the build command, since otherwise it does not show up in the built file?
[14:52:50] <jrburke> also, is that 4k difference minified and gzipped?
[14:53:43] <gseguin> jrburke: with findNestedDependencies=true jquery.mobile.init gets included in the bundle
[14:54:10] <jrburke> ah oops i glossed over that
[14:54:26] <gseguin> jrburke: 4k diff is before gzipped

[14:58:41] <johnbender> eddiemonge: looks like I can do the night of march 27th if you want
[14:58:48] <johnbender> the other meetup will be the night of the 28th
[15:00:52] <jrburke> gseguin: ok, so the done that does def() renaming is the smallest, followed by current master, then the "just leave the defs() alone".
[15:01:14] <gseguin> jrburke: indeed
[15:01:21] <gseguin> which makes sense
[15:01:34] <jrburke> i didn't quite follow the conversation above: johnbender and gseguin how would you like to proceed?
[15:02:35] <gseguin> I put the observations into a document on Basecamp to share with the folks offline and I'm waiting for them to weigh in
[15:02:39] <johnbender> jrburke: I'd like to avoid the extra build complexity, just because the only thing we get in trade is less code to look at near the top and bottom of the file
[15:02:51] <johnbender> but other than that I'd like to get other folks thoughts
[15:06:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 2 new commits to out-in-transition: http://git.io/D9HoZQ
[15:06:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/out-in-transition] Updated 3d transform test to accomodate FF10. - Mat Marquis
[15:06:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/out-in-transition] Merge branch 'out-in-transition' of github.com:jquery/jquery-mobile into out-in-transition - Mat Marquis
[15:06:17] <Wilto> Ugh ugh merge commit. Sorry, guys.
[15:07:06] <jrburke> johnbender: hmm, the def() rewriting (the 3386 branch, not the 3386-2) affects the interior code, and it is smaller in size once built/minified, compared to master. and you get nicer looking source files. it is still an all Java makefile too. but i'm happy to go with whatever you all would like. if you want to keep the master setup, I would like to do a change to add the 'jquery' dependency to each module and keep some of the
[15:07:06] <johnbender> Wilto: totally fine man, we'll have those all the time
[15:07:06] <jrburke> wrap.start and .end stuff, if that is ok. but also fine if you prefer not.
[15:07:11] <gseguin> Wilto: I swear I won't tell johnbender
[15:07:25] <Wilto> Yeah, that branch is kind of chaos.
[15:07:48] <Wilto> A rebase turned up a whole litany of conflicts.
[15:07:56] <johnbender> jrburke: yah I think the jquery dependency is a good idea
[15:08:33] <gseguin> Absolutely that should be done regardless of the way we go
[15:08:57] <gseguin> as well as moving the require.js script tag above the jquery one
[15:09:05] <jrburke> ah right, in the tests
[15:09:16] <gseguin> tests and docs
[15:09:20] <eddiemonge> johnbender: cool. i schedule you then. are you on meetup?
[15:09:40] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I am in deed
[15:09:43] <gseguin> eddiemonge: you're setting up a meetup on jqm ?
[15:09:50] <johnbender> gseguin: how does that work with mobileinit bindings?
[15:10:01] <johnbender> s/in deed/indeed/
[15:10:37] <gseguin> me looks
[15:10:38] <eddiemonge> http://www.meetup.com/SF-East-Bay-jQuery/
[15:10:50] <eddiemonge> gseguin: if you want, you can present this month or next
[15:11:30] <gseguin> hmm, I'll give it some thoughts, what kind of audience?
[15:12:07] <eddiemonge> mostly beginners and a lot of wordpress people
[15:12:11] <gseguin> johnbender: mobileinit is cool
[15:12:13] <eddiemonge> but a talk on amd would be cool
[15:12:32] <gseguin> if there is a dep on jquery it wont execute before jquery is loaded
[15:13:20] <gseguin> eddiemonge: how long of a talk?
[15:14:17] <eddiemonge> up to 2 hours
[15:15:04] <gseguin> oh wow
[15:15:34] <johnbender> gseguin: how would I go about defining one? Add it to the jquery.mobile.js ?
[15:15:44] * johnbender is perpetually confused
[15:16:08] <gseguin> johnbender: defining what?
[15:16:16] * gseguin is even more confused
[15:16:22] <johnbender> gseguin: a mobileinit binding
[15:16:38] <gseguin> oh that
[15:17:15] <gseguin> well, using an AMD loader or not?
[15:17:37] <johnbender> well you just said we could take the jquery script tag out of the tests
[15:17:41] <johnbender> so I'm assuming a loader
[15:17:53] <johnbender> or I guess without
[15:18:14] <gseguin> without it's the same way as before
[15:18:14] <johnbender> if it's being included already in the "without" option whatever that may be
[15:18:16] <gseguin> jquery
[15:18:24] <gseguin> mobileinit binding
[15:18:27] <gseguin> jqm
[15:18:36] <johnbender> is the "jqm" there just a ref to /js
[15:18:37] <johnbender> ?
[15:18:50] <gseguin> the compiled one yes
[15:18:53] <johnbender> kk
[15:19:20] <johnbender> so then in the case where we use a loader (like we do in the tests) if we just roll jquery into it, how would one define a mobile init callback
[15:19:42] <gseguin> so if you're using a loader
[15:19:59] * gseguin writes a gist
[15:20:16] <johnbender> you'll have to include it in the dependencies eh?
[15:20:22] <johnbender> in a new file?
[15:22:18] <gseguin> https://gist.github.com/1597422
[15:22:37] <johnbender> right
[15:23:19] <johnbender> a new file that has to be included in the deps list
[15:23:42] <gseguin> no, that would be you main AMD module
[15:23:59] <johnbender> ah
[15:24:33] <gseguin> you would load it doing <script data-main="main.js" src="require.js"></script>
[15:24:33] <johnbender> it just moves itself above jqm in the recursive require stack
[15:25:00] <johnbender> I'm still wary of foisting that on the team and other devs out there
[15:25:41] <johnbender> realizing fully that it's not an enormous amount of work, but even the async comes with its own overhead / education
[15:25:48] <gseguin> so you don't have to deal with that unless you're in an AMD env
[15:26:11] <johnbender> like the test suite
[15:26:20] <johnbender> which I'm having a hard enough time getting people to use as is :P
[15:26:23] <gseguin> indeed
[15:27:40] <Wilto> Just gonna sit here looking guilty; don’t mind me.
[15:27:52] <johnbender> lol, it's a pain in the ass to work in right now
[15:28:04] <johnbender> for reasons I've whined about perpetually since I built it
[15:28:10] <johnbender> so it's not your fault or anyone elses
[16:01:38] <gseguin> johnbender: the other solution is get rif of the IIFE wherever a scope is not needed
[16:02:46] <gseguin> but that's kinda dangerous
[16:34:44] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[16:34:55] <gseguin> I'm trying it out
[16:35:01] <gseguin> based on master
[16:35:10] <gseguin> to see how much we gain
[16:41:43] <gseguin> johnbender: jrburke: hybrid solution to keep the pragmas but get rid of IIFEs where not needed and remove all parameters from them where neede for scope, we get:
[16:41:54] * gseguin 220110 Jan 11 16:38 jquery.mobile.js
[16:42:09] <gseguin>     220110 Jan 11 16:38 jquery.mobile.js
[16:42:10] <Dragooon> Hola
[16:42:22] <gseguin>      83208 Jan 11 16:38 jquery.mobile.min.js
[16:42:33] <gseguin>      24994 Jan 11 16:38 jquery.mobile.min.js.gzip
[16:43:04] <jrburke> gseguin: hmm, but the IIFEs help keep each of your scripts internal state private? Seems like you could get some variable collisions otherwise if two modules define two different 'var foo'
[16:43:39] <gseguin> jrburke: I removed them only where a new scope was not needed
[16:43:56] <jrburke> (hmm, the 3386 code is still competitive with that :P )
[16:44:08] <gseguin> I know :)
[16:44:29] <jrburke> gseguin: ah i guess many of the modules just do a $.mobile.foo = {}
[16:44:32] <gseguin> but we don't have the post-processing step
[16:44:38] <Dragooon> This is a pretty annoying question, but has there been any progress with transitions since 1.0?
[16:44:44] <gseguin> jrburke: yep
[16:45:39] <gseguin> Dragooon: yes read the blog post: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/
[16:46:09] <jrburke> gseguin: minification is a post processing step, pretty severe one too. :) in any case though, just let me know what i should do a patch for, if you need my help. I'll be lurking but focused in other windows.
[16:46:33] <gseguin> 'k
[16:46:58] <gseguin> I'll wait for the other folks to respond too
[16:47:03] <gseguin> thanks jrburke
[16:49:20] <Dragooon> Oh popup widgets sounds nice. I can use it in order to replace a couple of mine
[16:49:47] <Dragooon> Well, not replace but can certainly help
[16:50:42] <Dragooon> Hm…the transitions are very good in ICS, but they have a delay in start
[16:52:06] <Dragooon> And it disabled transitions on my iPad :P
[17:50:47] <gseguin> and...
[17:50:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin created issue-3386-3 (+5 new commits): http://git.io/82xK3A

[19:36:52] <Dragooon> Question
[19:37:36] <Dragooon> What's the difference between fade-out-in and out-in branches?
[21:35:22] <gseguin> jrburke: ping
[21:35:37] <jrburke> gseguin: hi
[21:36:05] <gseguin> quick question, will the traceFiles branch eventually make it to master?
[21:36:50] <jrburke> it could if someone actually found it useful, but i have not gotten that feedback yet. I though the "uselib" branch was more useful for direct plugin dependency extraction
[21:37:04] <jrburke> but if you have a solid use case for traceFiles then we should talk about it more
[21:37:21] <gseguin> direct dependencies is good
[21:38:02] <gseguin> but deep dependencies could be useful too, don't you think?
[21:39:35] <jrburke> well that is pretty easy once you have the immediate ones. and tracefiles was more about finding all the files that were loaded in a given build config. so it is file path based where uselib's parse() usage was module ID based
[21:40:09] <jrburke> so i want to see some real use of either one before merging, do not want to merge just because we think it could be useful
[21:40:11] <gseguin> oh I see
[21:40:49] <gseguin> yeah no nevermind
[21:42:10] <gseguin> alright back to my web builder then, thanks!
[21:42:48] <jrburke> sure thing
