[05:18:34] <arschmitz_> Morning uGoMobi: _|Nix|_:
[05:18:34] <bot-t> (138 hours ago) <uGoMobi> tell arschmitz_ : safe travels and good luck monday!
[05:18:51] <uGoMobi_> 138 hours ago... lol
[05:19:02] <arschmitz_> lol
[05:19:04] <uGoMobi_> hey arschmitz_  welcome back
[05:19:10] <uGoMobi_> how did it go?
[05:19:26] <arschmitz_> good every one seemed to like my talk and said it was good
[05:19:34] <uGoMobi_> nice!
[05:19:45] <uGoMobi_> and how was Seoul?
[05:19:59] <arschmitz_> awesome
[05:20:08] <arschmitz_> they treated us like serious VIP's
[05:20:18] <uGoMobi_> cool
[05:23:03] <arschmitz_> miss anything in here?
[05:28:37] <arschmitz_> I managed to get a bug fix in while i was gone lol
[05:32:33] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz_: which bug?
[05:33:07] <arschmitz_> 4724
[05:34:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_: Do you have amd64?
[05:35:21] <uGoMobi_> _|Nix|_: nope, Intel
[05:40:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_: Well, I'm installing Ubuntu 12.10 amd64 into VirtualBox.
[05:41:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_: It'd be really weird if this was an arch-related issue.
[05:41:39] <_|Nix|_> I mean, you would think that with all the levels of abstraction between JS and the hardware, these things would be solved ...
[05:43:28] <uGoMobi_> _|Nix|_: I would be surprised too... only thing I can think of is that maybe the issue only happens if one of the support tests is failing
[05:44:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_: Good point - I should ask the reporter to check the console for any output.
[05:50:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_: OK, moment of truth ... booting into virtual Ubuntu 12.10 amd64 ...
[05:56:52] <uGoMobi_> _|Nix|_: make sure they don't kick you out of the (Intel) building ;-)
[06:06:45] <_|Nix|_> :) Well, I couldn't reproduce it, FWIW ...
[06:07:06] <_|Nix|_> Not sure whether I should close the bug or what ...
[06:07:19] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: Mind taking a look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5291
[06:15:27] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz_: sure, but have to go to a meeting now so will look at it later
[06:16:07] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: UNACCEPTABLE!! ha ha cool thanks no problem :)
[07:02:54] <toddmparker> good morning
[07:24:38] <arschmitz_> Morning
[07:40:54] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: issue 3880: i found the issue
[07:41:36] <arschmitz_> we are overwriting destroy and not calling $.Widget.prototype.destroy.call( this ); we should be using _destroy not destroy per http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#added-_destroy-method
[07:41:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz_: what is it?
[07:41:43] <arschmitz_> im sending pull request now
[07:42:00] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[07:42:54] <arschmitz_> so the widget is never destroyed we are just removing the classes and reseting padding
[07:43:19] <uGoMobi> I understand
[07:44:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz_: if you use "fixes #3380" or "fix #3380" in your commit message the issue will be automatically closed when we merge
[07:45:18] <arschmitz_> cool im doing it as we speak
[07:45:25] <uGoMobi> great
[07:47:39] <arschmitz_> ok sent it
[07:48:33] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: im thinking we may want to check other widgets as well to make sure we are properly calling destroy listview was ok because there is no destroy method at all
[07:49:53] <uGoMobi> listview not having a destroy method sounds as an issue on its own
[07:50:09] <uGoMobi> but yeah you are right, we should check that
[07:51:24] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: the only widgets that actually have destory in the widgets folder are fixedtoolbar and popup NONE of the rest have a destroy method at all
[07:51:38] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: checking the form widgets now
[07:53:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz_: maybe something to discuss with _|Nix|_ , he is good at that stuff
[07:53:53] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: ok the only widgets we have with any destroy method at all are select, select.custom, and popup basicly the stuff _|Nix|_ has worked on
[07:54:20] <arschmitz_> and fixedtoolbar of course
[07:54:40] <uGoMobi> then _|Nix|_ is definitely the person to talk to :)
[07:54:56] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: I think this is a problem we arnt cleaning up after ourselves at all like button 100% should have a destroy!
[07:55:21] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: really basicly all widgets should have a destroy
[07:55:36] <uGoMobi> that's what I was thinking
[07:56:13] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: the only case where its ok not to is if all we do is bind events and dont modify markup at all because then the widget factory will clean it up
[07:56:33] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: and only if we did it right with _on and didnt bind directly
[07:57:17] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: Ugh this isnt good lol

[08:11:12] <uGoMobi> gseguin: hey! fix for 3880 turned out not to be such a big change after all... think we should cherry-pick into 1.2-stable?
[08:11:50] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: +1 for cherry pick this is deffinitly a preexisting issue and should not break anything
[08:13:15] <gseguin> alright will cherry pick it
[08:14:09] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:15:17] <uGoMobi> instead of changing the topic of that issue to  _destroy() I should have looked at the code and change it in there ;)
[08:16:33] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: i had already made the change when you retitled i was just still writing the commit message and pulling :)
[08:16:44] <arschmitz_> or pushing rather!
[08:59:04] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: you see this comment? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3496#issuecomment-10399641
[08:59:13] <toddmparker> hey arschmitz_ good you had a nice trip
[08:59:20] <toddmparker> thanks for representing
[08:59:39] <arschmitz_> your more then welcome it was amazing!
[08:59:41] <toddmparker> now get back to work, we're over 300 issues again :)
[08:59:53] <toddmparker> did you get to do some sightseeing?
[08:59:56] <arschmitz_> ha ha iv allready sent two pr's this morning
[09:00:09] <arschmitz_> yeah they gave us a full day tour of the city tuesday
[09:00:10] <toddmparker> i saw, good to have you back
[09:00:22] <toddmparker> awesome. heard it's an amazing city
[09:00:35] <arschmitz_> it was and they really treated us like VIP's
[09:01:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: had to count to 100 when I saw that comment... that guy has a bit of an attitude problem, noticed it before
[09:02:08] <toddmparker> oh, for sure he is uGoMobi
[09:03:01] <toddmparker> which means we should prioritize a squeaky wheel, just wasn't sure if _|Nix|_ saw it
[09:06:36] <arschmitz_> toddmparker: he has been pretty disagreeable on some other issues in the past too that iv seen
[09:09:08] <gseguin> How about: "12 days and you haven't sent us a PR yet?"
[09:09:23] <arschmitz_> ^^ +100
[09:30:20] <frequent> uGoMobi: you there?
[09:33:49] <frequent> uGoMobi_: or here?
[09:34:14] <uGoMobi_> hey frequent
[09:34:19] <frequent> hi
[09:34:33] <frequent> I'm curious:
[09:34:46] <uGoMobi_> me too
[09:34:48] <uGoMobi_> :)
[09:34:52] <frequent> is there any naming conventions you are using in JQM?
[09:35:28] <frequent> Like for plugins I'm using widget factory, is there also a source for generic object/variable/whatever naming?
[09:36:27] <uGoMobi_> hmm... not really
[09:37:15] <frequent> hm.
[09:37:51] <uGoMobi_> well, might be not totally true
[09:37:59] <frequent> ?
[09:38:28] <uGoMobi_> thinking about events
[09:39:02] <uGoMobi_> but that's based on the widget factory
[09:39:08] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: for events varibles isnt it fooBar and for classes .foo-bar?
[09:39:53] <frequent> the classes rule seems obvious
[09:40:01] <frequent> events, too
[09:40:10] <uGoMobi_> yeah
[09:40:36] <arschmitz_> i *think* generally events we do the same as varibles
[09:40:36] <uGoMobi_> and we are consistent in the way we write them... camelCase etc.
[09:41:03] <frequent> ok
[09:41:05] <uGoMobi_> but you mean the name we use, right frequent?
[09:41:11] <frequent> yes
[09:41:57] <uGoMobi_> we just pick a name that describes it best
[09:42:04] <frequent> ok.
[09:42:19] <uGoMobi_> be creative :)
[09:42:26] <frequent> yeah!
[09:42:29] <frequent> Thanks
[09:42:32] <uGoMobi_> np
[09:42:50] <frequent> I'd have another tricky one for you and arschmitz
[09:43:15] <frequent> Does a viewport have to have position:static?
[09:43:21] <frequent> CSS position:static
[09:43:41] <frequent> Like a normal JQM page, the ui-viewport is the BODY, which is CSS:pos:static
[09:43:45] <uGoMobi_> you mean .ui-mobile-viewport?
[09:43:52] <frequent> yes, sorry
[09:44:12] <frequent> but when I have two panels side by side, both having ui-mobile-viewport and CSS:pos:static
[09:44:32] <frequent> if I changePage on one panel, during the transition it will stretch across the other panel, which looks horrible
[09:45:01] <frequent> if I use pos:absolute, width:....250px, the dimensions are set and I get a clean transition
[09:45:28] <frequent> but I'm not sure if setting position:absolute on a page container has any negative effects.
[09:45:58] <uGoMobi_> do you need to support Android? ;-)
[09:46:20] <uGoMobi_> nah, just kidding
[09:46:35] <uGoMobi_> I think you really have to do a lot of testing
[09:46:41] <frequent> I'd like to
[09:46:48] <frequent> here is a sample page http://bit.ly/RtkVqg
[09:47:00] <uGoMobi_> and I suggest to look at the history jquery.mobile.core.css
[09:47:01] <frequent> click on any of the icons to get the nasty transition
[09:47:38] <uGoMobi_> to see for what reason some rules had been set, what bug it fixed, etc.
[09:48:01] <frequent> ok. Thanks for the hint
[09:48:18] <uGoMobi_> I remember some changes in that file have been made to fix an issue with forms
[09:48:50] <uGoMobi_> so if that doesn't apply to your use case it might be safe to change it
[09:49:09] <frequent> ok. I will need to try.
[09:49:28] <frequent> thx again

[10:15:18] <toddmparker> gseguin - thank for that search field blur feature
[10:15:36] <toddmparker> did you get an answer re: focus?
[10:15:40] <gseguin> yeah no problem
[10:15:52] <gseguin> no, so the bug is fixed
[10:16:05] <gseguin> now if there is a reason to focus the first li
[10:16:11] <gseguin> I can definitely do that
[10:18:39] <toddmparker> we can test that
[10:19:52] <uGoMobi_> gseguin: on many sites that have an autocomplete search you can use arrow down to walk through the results
[10:20:01] <uGoMobi_> gseguin: for example http://www.imdb.com/
[10:20:13] <gseguin> ok
[10:20:16] <uGoMobi_> with our search filter you have to use tab
[10:20:38] <uGoMobi_> and skip the clear button first
[10:26:28] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i see
[10:26:37] <toddmparker> i'm a gabber, not an arrow key guy
[10:27:08] <toddmparker> just a note to add stuff here that we need to mention in the 1.3 blog post - features, changes to the api, etc. - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.3-Release-Notes
[10:27:56] <toddmparker> if folks can add links to the issue or the demo/docs, that would be great

[10:37:11] <ryanneufeld> yeah, that's what i thought I was gonna have to do, Thanks uGoMobi_

[10:59:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3496#issuecomment-10399641 was rather irritating.
[11:00:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: Which widget needs _destroy()?
[11:00:47] <arschmitz_> _|Nix|_pretty much all
[11:00:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: I mean, needs it right now. I don't want to implement _destroy() just for the sake of implementing destroy.
[11:01:20] <arschmitz_> none have been requested
[11:01:31] <arschmitz_> its just that none are cleaning up after themselves either
[11:01:45] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi_: is this a bug or am I doing it wrong? before: http://cl.ly/image/2c1W0e0t0D2z After: http://cl.ly/image/3u3X2j112l2U
[11:01:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: I know, and I do wonder how many people dynamically add/remove widgets.
[11:02:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: _destroy() for the select came about because someone ran into the problem.
[11:02:43] <arschmitz_> _|Nix|_ im putting it on my agenda for the meeting today
[11:02:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: The next _destroy() implem candidate would be checkbox, because we have a functional test that's supposed to be able to remove() checkboxes, but currently throws an error.
[11:02:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: OK.
[11:03:10] <toddmparker> meeting time
[11:03:18] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: repeat: is this a bug or am I doing it wrong? before: http://cl.ly/image/2c1W0e0t0D2z After: http://cl.ly/image/3u3X2j112l2U

[11:04:00] <agcolom> gseguin: thanks
[11:04:02] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: I'll see if I can repro it in a fiddle
[11:04:20] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: also, using 1.2 or latest?
[11:04:24] <ryanneufeld> 1.2
[11:04:34] <ryanneufeld> I usually only us stable
[11:04:47] <ryanneufeld> now that there is a stable release :p
[11:05:01] <uGoMobi> we just merged complete corner styling refactor
[11:05:12] <ryanneufeld> oic
[11:05:17] <ryanneufeld> new release?
[11:05:30] <uGoMobi> it's for 1.3 yeah
[11:05:33] <ryanneufeld> nice
[11:06:12] <uGoMobi> but if your case shows a bug we have to fix it for 1.2.1
[11:09:12] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/YpeT2/
[11:09:52] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: ok, I'll take a look after meeting
[11:16:04] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: fixedish with latest http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/YpeT2/3/
[11:16:10] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/NNCEW/ 1.2.0
[11:16:26] <ryanneufeld> both have teh problem of changing the padding it seems. Though I've not had that in my environment.
[11:18:46] <mspisars> all is there a list of features that is targeted for 1.3 that is viewable by the public?
[11:22:40] <_|Nix|_> kpepin: There was a thread not so long ago where we agreed with core as to what our HTML shall look like. The conclusion was pretty much this: <!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n\t<script src="filename.js"></script>...\n\t<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/stylesheet.css"></link>\n</head>\n<body>\n\t<div>...\n\t</div>\n</body>\n<html>
[11:22:51] <_|Nix|_> kpepin: I need to find that thread.
[11:22:59] <_|Nix|_> kpepin: The motivations are in there, I believe.
[11:24:28] <_|Nix|_> kpepin: Found the thread! Lessee if there are any links in there ...
[11:26:43] <_|Nix|_> kpepin: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/jquery-devs-team/wQy4eOk_N5c
[11:28:36] <kpepin> _|Nix|_ : I need permissions to the group to view.  (not currently a member).  I'll apply for membership.  :)
[11:29:47] <_|Nix|_> kpepin: Oh, sorry! OK ...
[11:29:55] <_|Nix|_> kpepin: I thought it was public ...
[11:30:04] <kpepin> No worries, I'd like to join, we'll see if they let me in.  ;)
[11:30:34] <kpepin> <== dives back into his hole for work related issues
[11:46:29] <_|Nix|_> kpepin: http://jquery.github.com/html-style-guide.html
[11:49:39] <toddmparker> anyone want to work on this one? should be straightforward - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3886
[12:00:18] * _|Nix|_ raises his hand
[12:35:31] <toddmparker> yessir
[12:37:38] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_...
[12:38:20] <agcolom> toddmparker: wilto: how do we deal with people who are not always v nice on github? (I've got a specific example... ok to put here?)
[12:41:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can we not close PR#5281, since you've already merged it into text-input-clear-btn?
[12:42:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I'll close it after I reviewed his additional commits, ok?
[12:42:44] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[12:46:17] <uGoMobi> mspisars: there is a Roadmap wiki page on the Github repo
[12:46:55] <mspisars> ty uGoMobi
[12:47:27] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: had a chance to look at my fiddles yet?
[12:47:42] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: just opening your fiddle
[12:48:04] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: I made two, one against latest one against 1.2.1
[12:48:12] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: 1.2.0*
[12:48:19] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/NNCEW/ 1.2.0
[12:48:28] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: your response to that jerky PR comment was good to me
[12:48:29] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: latest http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/YpeT2/3/
[12:48:51] <toddmparker> We want to be nice, but we have priorities and standards and it's ok to say "no thanks"
[12:49:18] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: what is the specific example? happy to have your back there
[12:49:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: For updating a controlgroup after adding a widget?
[12:49:53] <toddmparker> link?
[12:50:11] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3496#issuecomment-10420546
[12:50:12] <toddmparker> ?
[12:50:20] <agcolom> yes
[12:51:07] <toddmparker> i think we try to be professional, but firm
[12:51:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We have a functional test in tests/functional/controlgroup.html ...
[12:51:51] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We used that during development on the css-corner-styling branch.
[12:52:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I dunno where that can be reached ...
[12:52:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... but I suppose I can reproduce some of the functional test in a jsbin to illustrate the point ...
[12:52:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see ryanneufeld his fiddles... it's about changing button theme on the fly
[12:52:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4317 is closed
[12:53:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, there are still bugs with that?
[12:53:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but ryanneufeld his example is with an anchor that doesn't use the button widget, just buttonMarkup
[12:53:39] <ryanneufeld> I'm using the buttons as a ui to sort a list
[12:53:50] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Q: should we use the button widget for anchors with data-role="button" ?
[12:54:03] <ryanneufeld> I want to change the theme of the buttons to indicate the active sort
[12:54:12] <_|Nix|_> Button markup should be able to update the theme on-the-fly.
[12:54:33] <_|Nix|_> Not so button widgets ...
[12:54:46] <_|Nix|_> Or wait ... did I do that ...
[12:54:48] <_|Nix|_> Hold on ...
[12:54:59] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: you call the buttonMarkup function and thats why a button is enhanced within a button (looks like extra padding)
[12:55:12] <ryanneufeld> okay
[12:55:29] <ryanneufeld> still has the issue of rounded corners vs not
[12:55:33] <uGoMobi> if we would use the button widget ...  .button() .... there would be a refresh() method
[12:55:40] <ryanneufeld> is there a way to do what I'm trying to do?
[12:55:43] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I guess button now has _setOption() so it should be possible to set the theme on-the-fly ...
[12:56:04] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Lemme check that fiddle ...
[12:57:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but data-role="button" is in the initSelector of buttonMarkup() ... so anchor elements with that data-role don't use the widget at all
[12:59:05] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: the corner and padding issue is related
[12:59:12] <ryanneufeld> ok
[12:59:56] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: when you inspect the code after changing the theme you will see two additional span elements are nested in the original button
[12:59:56] <jqcommit> [api.jquerymobile.com] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/ZV4aFA
[12:59:57] <jqcommit> api.jquerymobile.com/master 151716b Anne-Gaelle Colom: Upgrade grunt-jquery-content to 0.5.14
[13:00:07] <ryanneufeld> ah
[13:00:09] <ryanneufeld> makes sense
[13:00:51] <toddmparker> (sorry, in a meeting)
[13:01:51] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I moved your fiddle to jsbin because there was some error inside the fiddle and on jsbin the theme change works correctly.
[13:01:54] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: http://jsbin.com/welcome/49510/edit
[13:02:04] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: No additional spans appear.
[13:02:12] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:02:14] <ryanneufeld> that's on latest
[13:02:18] <ryanneufeld> we're on 1.2
[13:02:24] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Ok.
[13:02:48] <_|Nix|_> ruryanneufeld: Lemme move back to 1.2 ...
[13:04:58] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: doesn't seem to ad it in the fiddle either
[13:05:00] <ryanneufeld> werid
[13:05:11] <ryanneufeld> OH
[13:05:14] <ryanneufeld> I found out why
[13:05:21] <ryanneufeld> I doubly included the js/css _|Nix|_
[13:05:24] <ryanneufeld> in my fiddle
[13:06:06] <ryanneufeld> oh, that's not it either... odd
[13:06:41] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: http://jsbin.com/ibomin/1/edit
[13:07:22] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: see last paragraph http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-anatomy.html
[13:07:49] <uGoMobi> I do think your script is included twice
[13:08:25] <uGoMobi> your script is between <body> and <div data-role="page">
[13:09:08] <ryanneufeld> well, that aside
[13:09:11] <ryanneufeld> the effect is the same
[13:09:20] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: http://jsbin.com/welcome/49516
[13:09:24] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Works fine ...
[13:09:43] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: ... aside from the rounded corners, but to fix that you need to call .controlgroup() on the controlgroup again.
[13:09:46] <ryanneufeld> yes
[13:09:55] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: ... in latest, you can .controlgroup( "refresh" ).
[13:09:55] <ryanneufeld> ha
[13:10:10] <ryanneufeld> that won't work on 1.2?
[13:10:22] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: No, because we've turned controlgroup into a widget after 1.2.0.
[13:10:39] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Before that it was merely a jQuery plugin.
[13:10:49] <ryanneufeld> oic
[13:10:59] <ryanneufeld> and calling it again is harmless
[13:11:00] <ryanneufeld> ??
[13:11:25] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Not in latest, though I'm starting to think maybe we should add that check.
[13:11:34] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Though I'm not sure what the effect would be.
[13:11:39] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I need to check with the UI guys.
[13:12:58] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: calling controlgroup() again in 1.2 probably works
[13:13:29] <uGoMobi> I remember fixing the issues that that was causing
[13:13:30] <ryanneufeld> okay
[13:13:32] <uGoMobi> lemme check
[13:13:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, that'll work, but AIUI he wants to leave that code in place for > 1.2 as well.
[13:13:39] <arschmitz_> _|Nix|_: widget factory dosent have any built in behivor for refresh its just whatever you set in the widget
[13:13:53] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: yes
[13:14:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: I know, but I wouldn't want to instances of the same widget to be created off one element.
[13:14:38] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/welcome/49523
[13:14:52] <arschmitz_> _|Nix|_: isnt that the whole point of using the widget factory ? to enforce lifcycle and stop that sort of thing?
[13:15:09] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: hmm... seems okay, but when you re-call the controll group, it resets to the default
[13:15:17] <ryanneufeld> I suppose i would have to set the data-attr as well
[13:17:11] <_|Nix|_> I have my answer from scott_gonzalez. If you attempt to instantiate the widget again, it will not create a new instance, but will call _init() again.
[13:17:31] <_|Nix|_> So, we can map _init() to _refresh() and have the 1.2 behaviour in > 1.2 ...
[13:17:54] <arschmitz_> _|Nix|_: yeah thats how your suposed to do it with the widget factory.
[13:18:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: Well, scott_gonzalez said that _init() maps to option() 99% of the time.
[13:18:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: Well, actually, there is a snag.
[13:19:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz_: During _create() we call this._refresh( true ), whereas after it's created, we call this._refresh( false );
[13:19:21] <arschmitz_> _|Nix|_: it seems like maybe we should review our widgets and make sure they are following widget factory guidelines, kinda like what we were talking about with _destroy() _on setoption etc
[13:19:46] <scott_gonzalez> No, _init() doesn't map to option(). Calling the plugin without a method does.
[13:19:58] <scott_gonzalez> _init() is its own concept, which most widgets don't use.
[13:20:18] <scott_gonzalez> .foo() on a non-existant widget => _create(), _init()
[13:20:26] <scott_gonzalez> .foo() on an existing widget => _init(), option()
[13:20:55] <scott_gonzalez> Why do your refresh() methods accept a boolean?
[13:21:47] <toddmparker> ok, i'm out of my meeting. sorry
[13:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> Widgets should work such that a call to .widget() "works as expected"
[13:22:16] <scott_gonzalez> That is, the behavior the first time and the second time should do whatever a user would think it would do.
[13:22:16] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: so new discovery
[13:22:20] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Because when you refresh out of _create() none of your children are visible, whereas when you refresh at runtime, those which are supposed to be visible are visible, and those which are not, are not.
[13:22:26] <scott_gonzalez> 99% of the time, that means don't do anything the second time.
[13:22:46] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: whats that
[13:22:47] <arschmitz_> right now many of our widgets dont really follow the guidelines for the widget factory
[13:23:02] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So, _during create we cannot use :visible.
[13:23:05] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: changing the theme, doesn't remove the classes from the old theme
[13:23:19] <scott_gonzalez> Why not set a flag in create?
[13:23:49] <scott_gonzalez> I guess as long as the flag shouldn't be set by users, it's fine.
[13:23:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I suppose I could do that.
[13:24:05] <scott_gonzalez> refresh( true ) only exists in _create() and called internally.
[13:24:05] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Nono. The public refresh() method has no flahs.
[13:24:28] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, I'm realizing that now. So that's probably fine.
[13:24:35] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's what we have now, but I'd like to move the refresh call to _init().
[13:24:54] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: However, if I do that, I need the flag-based approach, rather than the parameter-based one we have now.
[13:25:05] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: I cannot reproduce on this JS Bin http://jsbin.com/welcome/49523
[13:25:29] <ryanneufeld> hm
[13:25:39] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: We need to do something during _init: namely, to recalculate who the first visible/last visible child is.
[13:25:53] <scott_gonzalez> That's really the responsibility of refresh, not init.
[13:26:05] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Which is why I plan on calling refresh from init.
[13:26:06] <scott_gonzalez> Why are you trying to tie them together?
[13:26:20] <scott_gonzalez> Why are users re-initializing?
[13:27:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... because in 1.2, controlgroup was a jQuery plugin that, when called a second time, would essentially refresh.
[13:27:32] <scott_gonzalez> Ok, so this is just a one-off for this specific widget?
[13:27:37] <scott_gonzalez> It's just a back-compat issue?
[13:27:39] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah.
[13:27:43] <_|Nix|_> Basically.
[13:29:10] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/ibomin/1/
[13:29:19] <ryanneufeld> That's replicating it for me
[13:29:25] * uGoMobi is looking
[13:30:06] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: when you click on one of the sort options, that works
[13:30:15] <ryanneufeld> but the theme isn't changing correctly
[13:30:17] <ryanneufeld> not sure why
[13:30:25] <ryanneufeld> maybe it's our css?
[13:30:27] <uGoMobi> i see what you mean
[13:31:31] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Nice!
[13:31:39] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: ?
[13:32:10] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: Ok, that seems fine.
[13:32:47] <ryanneufeld> scott_gonzalez: if you look at my jsbin you can see what prompted part of this convo
[13:32:51] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Nicely illustrates the problem, I mean.
[13:32:55] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: yeah
[13:33:10] <ryanneufeld> show > tell
[13:34:01] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: The problem arises from the fact that 1.2 does not contain a fix for #3637.
[13:34:16] * ryanneufeld is embarrassed that he used One Direction for a demo
[13:34:17] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: It's not about #4317 at all.
[13:34:57] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Changing the theme of the button you're clicking involves a subtle juggle of hover/up/down classes.
[13:35:06] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: That's fixed in master and, I believe 1.2-stable.
[13:35:26] <ryanneufeld> 1.2 stable is yet to be released?
[13:35:28] <ryanneufeld> 1.2.1?
[13:36:13] <uGoMobi> 1.2 is our latest stable version
[13:36:27] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Yes. If the fix is in 1.2-stable, that means it will appear in 1.2.1.
[13:36:32] <ryanneufeld> Ah
[13:36:35] <ryanneufeld> okay
[13:36:43] <ryanneufeld> any ide when that will land?
[13:37:04] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: Lemme make sure that I've cherry-picked the fix to 1.2-stable.
[13:37:12] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I may not have ...
[13:37:40] <toddmparker> i really want to push a lot of this off to css. if you wan tot change a theme, change the theme class on the parent. if you want to change the class/state on a button, update the class
[13:37:56] <toddmparker> not always that simple, but as a goal
[13:38:10] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker: that would make our front end dev very happy
[13:38:15] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: BTW - if you like you can style your collapsible like this .. http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-collapsible.html
[13:38:27] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I did not cherry-pick that fix into 1.2-stable.
[13:38:45] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I need to do that, it seems, otherwise you'll have to wait for 1.3.0 to have it.
[13:39:13] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_: cherry pick plz?  What's the ETA on 1.3?
[13:39:26] <uGoMobi> 1.3 end of the year
[13:39:33] <ryanneufeld> okay
[13:39:53] <ryanneufeld> I am not sure I'll be testing this in production by then
[13:40:07] <jqcommit> [api.jquerymobile.com] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/hAqopg
[13:40:08] <jqcommit> api.jquerymobile.com/master 0f7ae3f Anne-Gaelle Colom: prepared slider for new grunt version
[13:40:24] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: I'd rather not push this to 1.2-stable if you don't absolutely need it.
[13:40:35] <toddmparker> ryanneufeld: is the bug with the sort by toggles?
[13:40:44] <_|Nix|_> ryanneufeld: If it can wait until 1.3.0 I'd rather it wait.
[13:40:59] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker: yes
[13:41:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It's #3637 in action.
[13:41:23] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker: are you looking at my most recent jsbin?
[13:41:25] <toddmparker> could those by radio buttons?
[13:41:37] <uGoMobi> full links to issues please :D
[13:41:39] <toddmparker> seems like you're trying to replicate the radio button behavior with links
[13:41:55] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker: you see, now you go and make sense
[13:42:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: C'mon! Just use the awesome bar!
[13:42:05] <ryanneufeld> and I'm gonna have to go and do some shit!
[13:42:15] <uGoMobi> haha
[13:42:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In FF: Ctrl+L, issue, <number>, Enter
[13:42:26] <uGoMobi> Awesome again
[13:42:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: s/issue/type the word "issue"/
[13:42:37] <uGoMobi> *Awasome bar
[13:42:55] <_|Nix|_> Seriously, Chrome is waaaay behind in this respect.
[13:43:00] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker: I'm rebuilding the back end of the site, and trying to repurpose as much of the front end as I can.
[13:43:14] <ryanneufeld> it was built >2 years ago :p
[13:43:29] <uGoMobi> but my Chrome syncs very nice with my Nexus
[13:43:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... meh ...
[13:43:45] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:43:46] <uGoMobi> and has Chrome to Phone app
[13:44:13] <toddmparker> ryanneufeld: i see. just seems like that would solve your issue too
[13:44:15] <uGoMobi> no shorturl's, once click and I see the site on my phone
[13:44:22] <toddmparker> or make it a navbar :)
[13:44:23] <uGoMobi> s/once/one/
[13:44:43] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker: oh, this will, the navbar idea was veto'd long ago
[13:44:46] <ryanneufeld> :(
[13:45:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, let's not get into a browser discussion. They all have their quirks ...
[13:45:13] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker: the horizontal radio is perfect
[13:45:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: agreed
[13:45:34] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:45:52] <toddmparker> ryanneufeld: yeah, that would seem ideal
[13:46:18] <toddmparker> you could just have that and lose the collapsible and 3 links if they will fit side by side
[13:47:03] <uGoMobi> from UI perspective horizontal radios would be a good idea
[13:48:13] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker: gonna try that
[13:49:24] <_|Nix|_> ... and #3637 is safe for another day. Yaaay!
[13:53:30] <toddmparker> ryanneufeld: cool. think it will look cleaner and allows you to easily set an initial active state on the current sort (if applicable)
[13:53:44] <toddmparker> so what else did we want to chat about after the meeting?
[13:53:51] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker: you are a gentleman and a scholar! http://cl.ly/image/2O3t03472V2F
[13:54:04] <ryanneufeld> _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi are also awesome
[13:54:12] <ryanneufeld> Thanks for the help everyone
[13:54:13] <toddmparker> aaah, much better.
[13:54:20] <toddmparker> np
[13:54:24] <ryanneufeld> though checked="checked" doesn't seem to be working
[13:54:26] <uGoMobi> you're welcome
[13:54:42] <toddmparker> should work ok
[13:55:11] <toddmparker> see: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/controlgroups/index.html
[13:55:27] <ryanneufeld> yeah, it's the theme
[13:55:33] <toddmparker> ah
[13:56:01] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and _|Nix|_ - thoughts on a standard name for the breakpoint class? i can rip thru and update this everywhere
[13:56:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: the Q is are we sure we want to stick to 1 breakpoint or maybe add more later
[13:56:59] <toddmparker> right, that is a biggie
[13:57:20] <arschmitz_> i was thinking maybe 2 phone / tablet / bigger then standard tablet
[13:57:23] <toddmparker> i'm of the mind that we could just do one BP per widget to start things off
[13:57:39] <toddmparker> but leave the option in the future to add more i guess
[13:57:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ui-breakpoint? ui-is-narrow? ui-is-wide?
[13:57:52] <toddmparker> worried about bloat
[13:58:05] <uGoMobi> I am in favor of as generic as possible
[13:58:11] <toddmparker> so far, i only have two BP - on the col toggle table
[13:58:17] <toddmparker> but i could just use one
[13:58:20] <uGoMobi> in case we want to add another later
[13:58:42] <toddmparker> yeah
[13:59:28] <uGoMobi> is the breakpoint going to be the same for all widgets
[13:59:43] <toddmparker> good question. i don't think so
[14:00:03] <uGoMobi> for example... for starters 30em
[14:00:11] <toddmparker> so far we have: reflow table, column toggle table, fiedlcontain form lable
[14:00:15] <toddmparker> oh and grid
[14:00:56] <toddmparker> for the label thing we are going to have a lower BP
[14:01:18] <toddmparker> most of the others can fall at a standard "above smartphone" width. whatever that is.
[14:02:05] <toddmparker> nice thing with the column toggle is it has regular increments for Bps so it will work fine for most people. choose the column priorities to finesse
[14:03:19] <toddmparker> iPhone 5 has a 568 screen width in landscape
[14:03:55] <toddmparker> fire/playbook have a 600px width
[14:03:58] <uGoMobi> what's the device width of mini tablets like Nexus 7 and iPad mini?
[14:04:08] <toddmparker> somewhere in that neighborhood maybe
[14:04:14] <toddmparker> ipad = 768
[14:04:16] <arschmitz_> i pad mini 1024
[14:04:21] <arschmitz_> in landscape\
[14:04:30] <uGoMobi> huh
[14:04:55] <uGoMobi> did they change the behaviour? not always reporting portrait?
[14:05:10] <toddmparker> oops, 768!
[14:05:13] <toddmparker> sorry
[14:05:34] <toddmparker> nexus 7 = 800px?
[14:05:52] <toddmparker> talking about device-width here which is what our MQs care about
[14:06:48] <toddmparker> fuzzy lines
[14:07:04] <arschmitz_> yeah sorry you are right 768
[14:07:51] <uGoMobi> so for the tables we should actually also include orientation in the MQ
[14:07:56] <uGoMobi> for iDevices
[14:08:10] <arschmitz_> uGoMobi: ipad mini and ipad are the same as far as reported screen size
[14:08:17] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[14:09:15] <uGoMobi> that's what makes this all so difficult to include in the framework

[14:11:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: haha nice!
[14:11:15] <uGoMobi> that's what I call Awesome
[14:11:20] <_|Nix|_> irssi rulz0rz!
[14:14:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: since the class will only be to opt-in a MQ and doesn't reflect what that MQ's breakpoint is exactly, ui-respond might be a better name
[14:14:56] <uGoMobi> we can look at table, grid, and fieldcontain to see what breakpoint fits best
[14:16:13] <uGoMobi> and in case we add anothter MQ/breakpoint later we could start using .ui-respond.ui-bp-a ui-respond.ui-bp-b

[15:14:26] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #848: UNSTABLE in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/848/
[15:19:00] <Krinkle> Is gabrielschulhof in this channel?
[15:19:07] <Krinkle> (not sure which nickname)
[15:19:25] <Krinkle> johnbender: ping
[15:27:58] <gseguin> Krinkle his nick is _|Nix|_
[15:28:05] <Krinkle> Aha
[16:02:28] <johnbender> Krinkle: pong
[16:02:28] <bot-t> (12 hours 10 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender $.browser.msie is gone from the latest version of core. It causes tests/unit/support to time out when run against jQuery Git, because there's an error: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined" at tests/unit/support/support_core.js:99
[16:04:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks for the heads up
[16:04:36] <Krinkle> johnbender: Hi, I was wondering if you could provide a small set of browsers you think would be good for a test run in testswarm against jquery-mobile
[16:04:46] <Krinkle> a few hours from now a major deployment will take place
[16:04:59] <Krinkle> after that it will be possible to run various mobile devices from jenkins for builds
[16:05:10] <Krinkle> (replacing the IE9 single set)
[16:05:18] <Krinkle> basically anything in browserstack is supported)
[16:06:11] <Krinkle> part of this deployment is support for BrowserStack API v2, which means android, ios, macosx will be available now.
[16:07:48] <johnbender> Krinkle: I've spent approximately 3 weeks work of working getting our suite passing in using browserstack
[16:08:08] <johnbender> all tests that use window.history.back() fail
[16:08:17] <johnbender> and they pass when run manually in a vm
[16:08:33] <johnbender> in IE
[16:08:46] <Krinkle> the passing of tests is up to you. afaik all browserstack workers are now as real as the real deal, so there is no more "browserstack-specific" things that may or may not work.
[16:08:50] <johnbender> in my branch they were passing for the other browsers that are in the json config
[16:09:08] <johnbender> Krinkle: we already have a build if that's what you're asking
[16:09:12] <Krinkle> I know
[16:09:13] <johnbender> it's just not running
[16:09:33] <Krinkle> I'm saying that as of tomorrow the browserSets array may contain more than just desktop browsers/version.
[16:09:33] <johnbender> so you just want a list of browsers to put in the json config?
[16:09:57] <Krinkle> and would be nice to be able to verify with a real build that those new VMs at browserstack work properly
[16:10:14] <johnbender> Krinkle: what are the conditions for "working properly"
[16:10:18] <Krinkle> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/blob/master/config/sample-localSettings.json#L12
[16:10:24] <johnbender>  just that the tests pass/fail/timeout ?
[16:10:47] <Krinkle> johnbender: as far as I'm concerned: jenkins build triggered, job submitted to testswarm, testswarm-browserstack bridge spawns VMs and make them run the tests
[16:10:53] <johnbender> Krinkle: I would just pick the newest version of each
[16:11:10] <Krinkle> whether they pass or not is not my concern at this stage as that is not related to the continuous integration envirnoment (unless it is a bug in the environment, of course)
[16:11:20] <johnbender> Krinkle: cool
[16:11:40] <johnbender> Krinkle: yah I would just pick the newest version of the new vms (android/ios)
[16:11:54] <johnbender> I don't think it's super important to do a different os for the desktop browsers right now
[16:11:59] <johnbender> unless you just want to test it out
[16:12:05] <Krinkle> the browserSet can be as specific or generic as you want (browserFamily, osFamily, deviceFamily are all optional, at least 1 is required)
[16:12:06] <johnbender> in which case I would do safari on osx instead of on windows
[16:12:18] <Krinkle> ok
[16:12:32] <johnbender> Krinkle: least likely to fail in each case
[16:12:44] <Krinkle> alrighty, I'll keep that in mind.
[16:12:52] <johnbender> since that's where I would start working when I get back to it
[16:26:30] <johnbender> Krinkle: thanks for doing that btw
[16:26:43] <Krinkle> yw
[16:27:05] <johnbender> once I take the time to get the suite in a good place I can't wait to have that being a regular build and I know that you've done a ton of work on it
[16:27:09] <johnbender> it's very much appreciated
[23:34:06] <LakWork_> I love midnight hotifxes as a result of a feature change introduced in jqm 1.2 :(
