[07:21:49] <uGoMobi> toddparker: are you here?
[08:42:52] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:16:26] <uGoMobi> gseguin: good morning

[09:17:39] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2270 on jquery-mobile (frequent; 9m, 2w ago): navbar ul breaking in IE7
[09:18:10] <uGoMobi> gseguin: that issue is assigned to you
[09:19:30] <uGoMobi> if ok with you I assign it to me, or were you about to fix it? ;-)
[09:30:37] * gseguin looks
[09:31:07] <gseguin> uGoMobi: you can have it
[09:32:23] <uGoMobi> thanks ;-)
[09:32:44] <johnbender> gseguin: super nice
[09:33:03] * gseguin likes tests!
[09:33:32] <gseguin> though johnbender there is something wrong with the test framework
[09:33:39] <gseguin> if you look at the Jenkins page
[09:33:39] <johnbender> ?
[09:33:53] <gseguin> yesterday's failures don't appear in the chart
[09:36:57] <johnbender> gseguin: yah, there was an issue with file output in the case
[09:37:04] <johnbender> gseguin: so it borked on reading the results
[09:37:05] <johnbender> hmm
[09:37:12] <johnbender> might have to take a look at that
[09:37:55] <uGoMobi> johnbender: hi John
[09:38:19] <uGoMobi> johnbender: can you take a look at this one https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4482
[09:38:19] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4482 on jquery-mobile (tegansnyder; 22h, 35m ago): Nightly CSS files - structure file off
[09:39:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ah, thanks for bringing that to my attention I'll take a look
[09:39:46] <uGoMobi> johnbender: thanks, I had a quick look already but don't understand the Grunt stuff
[10:26:17] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm wondering if that has anything to do with the pragma changes we made

[10:50:31] <gseguin> toddparker: what was the name of the tool you mentionned to control your test devices ?
[10:50:52] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: did you see my message last night?
[10:55:45] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: I'll check it out in a bit.
[11:00:49] <johnbender> gseguin: Adobe shadow?
[11:01:05] <gseguin> oh yeah I think that was it
[11:01:14] <gseguin> thanks johnbender
[11:06:36] <toddparker> hi all
[11:06:39] <toddparker> catching up
[11:08:44] <toddparker> gseguin - yeah, shadow
[11:08:54] <toddparker> iOS and ANdroid
[11:09:09] <toddparker> lets you quickly open a URL across all and remote debug
[11:09:12] <toddparker> good stuff
[11:09:28] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm sure those guys would be pleased to hear that you've enjoyed using it
[11:25:36] <toddparker> i have a meeting with them actually :)
[11:25:42] <toddparker> i'll tell 'em myself
[11:26:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: On http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html I can not open the popups with keyboard, i.e. can not get focus on those buttons by using tab. Is that work in progress or want me to open a ticket for it?
[11:35:30] <scott_gonzalez> gseguin: Looks good :-)
[11:35:54] <gseguin> awesome
[11:36:05] <gseguin> thanks toddparker
[11:37:18] <toddparker> uGoMobi: that should be accessible
[11:37:22] <toddparker> so yes
[11:38:07] <toddparker> i see
[11:38:23] <toddparker> looks like the focus class maybe isn't being applied correctly?
[11:38:41] <uGoMobi> toddparker: it's not just the class
[11:38:47] <toddparker> yeah?
[11:39:11] <uGoMobi> toddparker: first item in navmenu gets focus
[11:39:12] <toddparker> trying to navigate around now
[11:39:49] <toddparker> yeah, seems like it moves thru the basics/general/methods buttons, then right to the left nav
[11:40:00] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:40:21] <toddparker> but after the left nav, i have to hit tab a lot to circle back
[11:40:26] <toddparker> thinking those might be the buttons
[11:40:35] <toddparker> but i can't sees shift
[11:40:48] <uGoMobi> ok, let me try again
[11:41:02] <toddparker> oddly, buttons get focus properly here for example
[11:41:02] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[11:41:45] <toddparker> so it seems to be a problem with that page
[11:41:53] <toddparker> or with popups attached to the buttons
[11:41:59] <toddparker> _|Nix|_ ^^
[11:42:39] <toddparker> even that normal link (popup) doesn't get visual focus. what the...
[11:45:09] <uGoMobi> you might be right about the popup buttons get focus (not visible) after left navmenu
[11:46:33] <uGoMobi> when i set focus state in Chrome code inspector focus style is visible
[11:59:43] <toddparker> hmm
[11:59:46] <toddparker> interesting
[12:00:09] <toddparker> there must be something killing the focus class or it's visibility
[12:09:29] <uGoMobi> toddparker: "you might be right about the popup buttons get focus (not visible) after left navmenu" <<< turns out focus is back on top horizontal navmenu (but not visible) after last item in left menu

[15:17:37] <agcolom> toddparker: hi just waiting to cross the channel to go to France :-) I saw your spreadsheet with devices. Are you interested in adding our own devices? Even if it does't go to the donation page, it may be a good idea to keep up to date a spreadsheet of who owns or has access to which devices... What do you think?

[16:11:46] <gseguin> what about it ?
[16:11:57] <gseguin> oh I see your comment
[16:12:00] * gseguin reads
[16:13:56] <gseguin> johnbender: do you want to land it?
[16:14:32] <gseguin> I don't think MauriceG fixed the comment I made but it's not a big deal to add it afterward
[16:14:53] <gseguin> I'm kinda concerned that there is not tests with it
[16:27:30] <johnbender> gseguin: he did
[16:27:34] <johnbender> same
[16:27:43] <johnbender> I asked the two guys who commented if they would like to contribute tests
[16:27:57] <johnbender> generally the testing on the fixed toolbar is anemic
