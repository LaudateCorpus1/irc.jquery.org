[06:35:12] <arschmitz> Morning uGoMobi
[06:35:19] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[06:35:20] <bot-t> (9 hours 50 mins ago) <johnbender> tell uGoMobi I'll pester you in the morning
[06:35:43] <arschmitz> i pushed all the updates to range everything should be good for you to work on the css
[06:37:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its finished i think untill we start testing for if anyone has something that should be changed
[06:37:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: great
[06:38:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I will test my changes on that branch later today
[06:38:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if all you changed is css it should be the same i belive
[06:39:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: all the changes i belive were more "under the hood" type stuff nothing that effects the layout or positioning at all
[06:39:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: i also added a wrapper div in the JS but that should only affect slider, not range
[06:39:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool i didnt make any more changes to slider. 
[06:40:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah not needed in range it already has a wrapper
[06:41:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: destroy is a bit weird on range right now. because it only destroys itself not the sliders because slider does not have a _destroy method right now 
[06:42:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I suppose we leave that until 1.4
[06:42:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that was my plan
[06:42:45] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:44:33] <arschmitz> oh and i did rename everything to rangeslider
[06:45:05] <uGoMobi> perfect
[06:45:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i think everything we have talked about is done now
[06:46:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: is there a ticket for rangeslider? ;-)
[06:46:06] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:47:01] <arschmitz> wait for it .....
[06:47:03] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15arschmitz opened issue #5355: New Widget: Range Slider  02http://git.io/aXRGcw
[06:47:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi^^
[06:47:24] <uGoMobi> haha
[06:47:51] <uGoMobi> we will close that one with the merge commit
[06:47:57] <arschmitz> yup
[06:48:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do we have to look at unit tests?
[06:48:20] <uGoMobi> don't remember if you already added those
[06:48:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes i havent made it that far yet
[06:48:27] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:48:42] <uGoMobi> then we need to do that too before merging
[06:48:47] <arschmitz> yup
[06:49:10] <arschmitz> thankfully there isnt too much to test since most of it is covered by slider
[06:49:25] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:49:45] <uGoMobi> we could check if there are two handles and two inputs
[06:49:54] <uGoMobi> that test makes sense :D
[06:49:58] <arschmitz> yes and we need to check the highlight
[06:50:07] <arschmitz> to make sure it updates properly
[06:50:21] <arschmitz> and check to make sure min < max
[06:50:47] <uGoMobi> right
[06:51:11] <uGoMobi> I decided to make on combined demo/test page for docs
[06:51:33] <uGoMobi> for slider and rangeslider that is
[06:51:41] <arschmitz> yeah makes sense
[06:51:47] <uGoMobi> (and flip toggle)
[06:51:47] <arschmitz> they are so closely related
[06:52:13] <uGoMobi> yeah easier to see if styling is consistent
[06:52:28] <uGoMobi> width and input position actually
[06:52:37] <arschmitz> yeah thats why i made http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/range.html
[06:52:45] <arschmitz> to be able to compare them side by side 
[06:52:55] <arschmitz> well top / bottom lol
[06:53:00] <uGoMobi> yes good idea
[06:53:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: all the current slider tests still pass too so no worries there
[06:54:02] <uGoMobi> will copy your markup and add source code view
[06:54:14] <arschmitz> cool
[06:54:26] <uGoMobi> ok good
[06:54:42] <uGoMobi> finishing some other demos first and then I look into this
[06:54:50] <uGoMobi> would be nice to land this today
[06:54:53] <arschmitz> i better fix my labels they are all associated to a non existant element from copy and past on something old ha ha 
[06:55:06] <uGoMobi> yeah I hear
[06:55:23] <uGoMobi> so annoying to make all ID's unique on demo pages
[06:55:44] <uGoMobi> good thing is that we don't use Ajax
[06:56:00] <uGoMobi> so you don't have to worry about ID's on other pages in the DOM
[07:07:54] <Wilto> Whatâ€™d I do.
[07:08:19] <uGoMobi> Wilto: morning
[07:08:25] <Wilto> console.log( validStyle( 'perspective', '10px', ['moz', ''] ) );
[07:08:28] <Wilto> Hell. I AM fired.
[07:08:31] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:08:39] <Wilto> iâ€™ll pack my things
[07:08:50] <Wilto> I gotta get my pre-commit linting back in place.
[07:08:53] <Wilto> Sorry about that.
[07:08:58] <uGoMobi> I didn't see the console.log when i saw the error message in Jenkins console
[07:09:26] <uGoMobi> I thought the linter had a problem with the [ ]  in there or something
[07:09:57] <uGoMobi> so at the end it was very simple to fix :)
[07:10:00] <uGoMobi> np
[07:33:19] <toddmparker> morning
[07:33:27] <toddmparker> arschmitz: the slider range looks great
[07:33:59] <arschmitz> thanks im fixing a big problem i just found though lol
[07:34:18] <toddmparker> yeah?
[07:35:10] <toddmparker> actually, the split ones don't' seem to have the inputs aligned right
[07:35:19] <toddmparker> chrome/mac
[07:35:25] <toddmparker> at wider widths
[07:35:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah im fixing soem things right now
[07:35:57] <arschmitz> my labels were not associated properly and when i fixed it things blew up
[07:35:59] <toddmparker> the full width doesn't seem to be really full widthâ€¦seems to have some margin so it's closer to 90%
[07:36:19] <arschmitz> so the demo page is broken for a few minutes untill i fix
[07:36:27] <toddmparker> ok
[07:36:36] <toddmparker> </QA>
[09:00:46] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ping
[09:00:59] <uGoMobi> johnbender: pong
[09:01:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: did you need me to look at something?
[09:01:38] <uGoMobi> johnbender: was looking for you yesterday because I thought I need help with lint issue
[09:01:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: gseguin helped?
[09:02:01] <uGoMobi> johnbender: but I should have looked better... problem was a console.log in the code
[09:02:10] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah, gseguin noticed it
[09:02:33] <uGoMobi> johnbender: thanks anyway
[09:03:01] <uGoMobi> johnbender: we also have to look at a test for that checkbox regression
[09:03:13] <uGoMobi> johnbender: like we discussed during yesterday's meeting
[09:03:29] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I suggest to look at this next week when _|Nix|_ is back
[09:03:30] <johnbender> uGoMobi: do you need my help with that?
[09:03:33] <johnbender> ah ok
[09:03:35] <johnbender> cool
[09:03:51] <uGoMobi> I reverted that change so we are good
[09:04:38] <uGoMobi> I think it's a better to create a test when we now what the code is going to look like... _|Nix|_ is working on that
[09:04:45] <uGoMobi> s/now/know
[09:08:34] <toddmparker> hey all
[09:08:48] <toddmparker> made a todolist for remaining plan stuff - http://oksoclap.com/C1Lv3eBfTF
[09:08:55] <toddmparker> panel
[09:09:06] <toddmparker> hopping to mostly wrap it up today, we'll see
[09:09:47] <toddmparker> wilto, rookie move
[09:12:13] <toddmparker> sorry, i can't type this morning.
[09:18:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: you around?
[09:18:37] <arschmitz> i am
[09:18:46] <Wilto> BOO WILTO
[09:18:55] <johnbender> arschmitz: did you and I go looking for javascript slide solutions that supported markdown?
[09:19:02] <arschmitz> yes
[09:19:09] <johnbender> arschmitz: which library did we land on
[09:19:12] <arschmitz> reveal.js
[09:19:13] <johnbender> it looked promising
[09:19:17] <johnbender> arschmitz: ah thank you
[09:19:19] <arschmitz> i liked it a lot
[09:19:27] <toddmparker> that is a nice one
[09:19:35] <arschmitz> kborchers: uses it too
[09:20:05] <toddmparker> there is now a wysiwyg editor since you guys don't' know how to code - http://www.rvl.io/
[09:20:49] <arschmitz> lol iv been meaning to learn to code
[09:20:58] <arschmitz> just seems like too much trouble
[09:21:53] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah this could be really cool
[09:22:06] <arschmitz> johnbender: it worked really well for me
[09:22:57] <johnbender> arschmitz: I only have a few question marks
[09:23:03] <johnbender> arschmitz: image based backgrounds
[09:23:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: and doing vertical slides with pageup and pagedown appears to be bugged in the demo
[09:23:39] <arschmitz> i didnt try that but i cant see any reason why you couldnt do an image background
[09:23:44] <johnbender> arschmitz: right
[09:23:56] <arschmitz> since its all just css 
[09:24:13] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's more where it is in the slide relative to how it full screens on 1024 
[09:24:25] <johnbender> maybe I can set the slide size?
[09:24:56] <arschmitz> pageup and pagedown work fine for me by the way
[09:25:21] <johnbender> arschmitz: it works but skips the first slide in the first vertical set
[09:25:24] <johnbender> for me at least
[09:26:20] <arschmitz> oh i bet thats the demo because you can have it come in at any point you want in the vertical set
[09:26:38] <johnbender> arschmitz: nice
[09:26:55] <johnbender> I can just do my slides linearly too, though grouping like that would sure be nice for sections
[09:27:05] <johnbender> I tend to group things logically like that
[09:27:41] <arschmitz> yeah i started doing both but switched to linear because i kept forgetting and going over instead of down or stuff like that lol
[09:27:59] <johnbender> arschmitz: that's the nice thing abotu page up / page down with a clicker
[09:28:10] <johnbender> it maintains order
[09:28:12] <arschmitz> yeah i wasent using a clicker 
[09:28:46] <johnbender> not all lappys have page up and page down now either  :)
[09:32:15] <arschmitz> johnbender:looks like image background might be a bit tricky
[09:32:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah, that's what I was thinking
[09:32:32] <arschmitz> johnbender:but there is a call back you could use to set it with js
[09:32:38] <johnbender> meh
[09:32:48] <johnbender> I should probably abandon that and learn to use color 
[09:32:49] <johnbender> lololol
[09:35:59] <johnbender> arschmitz: I'm sure I can do it, the question is will it behave properly on 1024x768
[09:36:17] <johnbender> in showoff that's the slide size default
[09:36:19] <johnbender> and it's obvious
[09:36:20] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah 
[09:44:11] <johnbender> arschmitz: am I completely daft or is the download not obvious?
[09:44:25] <arschmitz> you have to fork it
[09:44:29] <arschmitz> on github
[09:44:31] <johnbender> ...
[09:44:38] <johnbender> why doesn't it say that
[09:44:45] <johnbender> anywhere
[09:44:49] <arschmitz> i dont know it took me forever to figure it out too
[09:45:02] <johnbender> arschmitz: PR?
[09:45:07] <johnbender> for the readme?
[09:45:20] <arschmitz> probably should
[09:45:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: alright once I get it right I'll do that
[09:45:45] <arschmitz> johnbender: cool
[09:46:13] <johnbender> arschmitz: this is just silly
[09:46:17] <johnbender> lol
[09:46:27] <johnbender> provide the download on gh-pages or something
[09:46:33] <arschmitz> johnbender: i completely agree
[09:46:49] <arschmitz> it does not make sense to fork it at all because you dont want to change you want to use 
[09:47:13] <johnbender> oh well
[09:47:56] <johnbender> arschmitz: do you use grunt to build it?
[09:48:10] <johnbender> linting errors here
[09:48:45] <arschmitz> i didnt build it so i didnt notice
[09:48:56] <johnbender> arschmitz: ... it's just checked in?
[09:49:01] <johnbender> zomg it is
[09:49:02] <johnbender> lol
[09:49:05] <arschmitz> there is no need to build it works as is
[09:49:18] <johnbender> the build artifact is checked in
[09:49:19] <johnbender> hmm
[09:49:27] <johnbender> why is it that all slide software is terrible
[09:49:33] <johnbender> showoff is just brutal on the inside
[09:49:48] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:50:40] <arschmitz> guess no one wants to put the time in on a truely good one
[09:50:52] <johnbender> arschmitz: well this one is great
[09:50:57] <johnbender> well thought out and everything
[09:51:06] <johnbender> but the install is certainly odd
[09:51:17] <arschmitz> very
[09:51:28] <arschmitz> i think that was the part that confused me the most too
[09:51:52] <arschmitz> was just how to get and set it up but the answer seemed to be to pretty much just fork and edit the index.html
[10:05:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: zomg so difficult to set up
[10:07:02] <johnbender> arschmitz: working now
[10:07:07] <johnbender> 20 minutes later
[10:07:25] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah sounds like about how long it took me
[10:07:41] <arschmitz> johnbender: they really need to add setup instructions to the readme
[10:07:55] <johnbender> arschmitz: he needs a gh-pages with a list of the versions, links to the files, and a boilerplate
[10:08:18] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah even better
[10:09:28] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah using the index.html is a pain when trying to setup because it already has a ton of slides and crap
[10:09:46] <johnbender> yep
[10:09:58] <johnbender> arschmitz: I was just following the js errors lololol
[10:11:35] <toddmparker> we have a slide deck written with jQuery Mobile we're hacking on
[10:11:39] <toddmparker> not ready to be shared tho
[10:12:05] <johnbender> toddmparker: support markdown?
[10:12:19] <johnbender> :)
[10:12:21] <johnbender> that was a joke
[10:12:32] <johnbender> that and code highlighting is really the only thing I care about
[10:12:44] <toddmparker> check
[10:13:02] <toddmparker> we bagged on markdown because it doesn't do  everything we'd need
[10:13:10] <toddmparker> like add a class to something
[10:45:18] <Wilto> i love markdown so much tho
[10:51:00] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and arschmitz - having trouble understanding this issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5163#issuecomment-11121522
[10:51:16] <toddmparker> we're doing a lot of work on panels today so this may not be an issue anyway
[10:51:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: reading now
[10:52:01] <arschmitz> toddmparker:looking
[10:53:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker:with push mode it scrolls to top of page with reveal it does not
[10:54:02] <uGoMobi> right
[10:54:27] <uGoMobi> same for overlay
[10:54:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker: also with push the panel is only screen height with reveal its page height
[10:54:56] <uGoMobi> so it's about bringing the top of the panel in view when you open it
[10:55:54] <uGoMobi> if possible it would be nice if the content of the panel scrolls with the page
[10:56:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i agree make it position fixed
[10:56:31] <uGoMobi> position fixed... ouch ... ;)
[10:56:37] <uGoMobi> but yeah
[10:57:20] <arschmitz> i just tried it an bugs with fixed aside i like it fixed
[10:58:48] <arschmitz> actually i REALLY like it with position fixed and the main content scrolling super nice effect
[10:59:46] <uGoMobi> maybe there are other ways to achieve the same without the bugs of position fixed
[11:00:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is there a way to emulate position fixed with out position fixed and not having it be js weirdness? if so why arnt we doing it with fixedtoolbars lol?
[11:00:48] <uGoMobi> nice thing is that when you have a fixed header with a menu button to open the panel, the panel will always show the same even when you open it when you scrolled to the bottom of the page
[11:02:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: something like setting top offset on panel contents with JS
[11:02:54] <uGoMobi> I agree position fixed is easiest
[11:03:18] <uGoMobi> just don't know if we will run into a lot of issues again
[11:03:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker: im sure there will be some lol but we have solved a lot so it shouldnt be as bad as before
[11:04:27] <arschmitz> also a bunch of the fixes in the fixedtoolbar extension will work regardless of it actually being a toolbar or not if you use fixedtoolbars also
[11:10:51] <uGoMobi> I am away for an hour or so... catch up later
[11:16:04] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15arschmitz pushed 1 new commit to 06range: 02http://git.io/Xsl2Sw
[11:16:04] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06range 14459fbfc 15Alexander Schmitz: Rangeslider: Fixed problem with associating labels allowed use of two labels, fixed problems with field contains.
[11:21:59] <johnbender> arschmitz: argh it doesn't track slide position
[11:22:04] <johnbender> I'm going to have to hack that in
[11:22:42] <johnbender> arschmitz: oops nevermind
[11:22:45] <johnbender> init setting
[11:23:04] <toddmparker> johnbender: look familiar? http://engineering.twitter.com/2012/12/implementing-pushstate-for-twittercom_7.html?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter
[11:24:04] <johnbender> toddmparker: mother fucker
[11:24:14] <toddmparker> heh
[11:24:40] <johnbender> toddmparker: oh
[11:24:43] <johnbender> they aren't open sourcing it
[11:24:48] <johnbender> lol
[11:24:52] <johnbender> and it doesn't do history management
[11:24:54] <Wilto> YES
[11:25:04] <johnbender> and it doesn't look like it normalizes the event
[11:25:09] <johnbender> both of which our solution does
[11:25:09] <Wilto> QotD goes to JOHN BENDER
[11:25:13] <johnbender> whilst being open source
[11:25:36] <toddmparker> we betta
[11:25:40] <johnbender> well
[11:25:44] <johnbender> we'll see
[11:25:49] <johnbender> the idea is sound
[11:25:54] <toddmparker> our nag is pretty epic
[11:25:57] <johnbender> and the implementation seems to be working just fine
[11:26:00] <johnbender> but we'll see
[11:26:29] <toddmparker> arschmitz: we're looking at maybe adding fixed for the overlay and reveal IF the panel content is shorter than the viewport
[11:26:49] <toddmparker> low tech thing we're going to do: scroll to the top of the page if you're scrolled down
[11:26:52] <johnbender> arschmitz: damnit it doesn't load the proper slide if you attempt to deep link
[11:26:55] <johnbender> that I will have to hack in
[11:27:40] <Wilto> So just to be clear: we win, right?
[11:27:42] <johnbender> arschmitz: with Reveal.slide looks doable pretty easily
[11:27:53] <johnbender> Wilto: I have to read the article first
[11:28:10] <Wilto> Gonna go ahead and call it for us in advance.
[11:29:15] <johnbender> Wilto: I don't kow what they do internally but i'd imagine they have to support the back button on some level
[11:29:20] <johnbender> who knows what the implementation is
[11:29:32] <johnbender> Wilto: our job is harder though
[11:29:54] <Wilto> Ainâ€™t that the truth.
[11:30:02] <johnbender> in normalizing popstate/hashchange I provided the "state" that would be provided for popstate in the case of hashchange as well
[11:30:28] <johnbender> so whether you use hashchange or pushstate you can set a state value with each url alteration made using $.navigate
[11:30:49] <johnbender> the `navigate` is uniform in both cases
[11:31:10] <Wilto> Iâ€™ll give you one (1) American dollar if you blog this sucker up.
[11:31:21] <johnbender> Wilto: I plan to at some point
[11:31:26] <Wilto> Badass.
[11:31:36] <toddmparker> you really should
[11:31:46] <toddmparker> be nice if people could use nav alone
[11:31:50] <johnbender> I want my props if they are out there to be gotten
[11:32:06] <johnbender> toddmparker: well they'll be able to use this with a minimum of deps
[11:32:10] <Wilto> You will have your propers, sir.
[11:32:13] <johnbender> though that can be trimmed down significantly
[11:32:14] <Wilto> Oh, such propers you shall have.
[12:14:40] <toddmparker> johnbender: yeah, in the next rev, we can do more to package up nav standalone and out of core
[12:15:02] <toddmparker> arschmitz: your demo looks better
[12:15:12] <toddmparker> full width is much fuller width
[12:15:41] <arschmitz> Yea I was changing things while you were looking at it before 
[12:16:13] <arschmitz> It still needs a little work when it's in a fieldcontain
[12:16:21] <agcolom> Good evening! Hey, no more excuses for not illustrating issues properly! Here come the GitHub issue attachments! https://github.com/blog/1347-issue-attachments
[12:17:28] <agcolom> (so hopefully people who report issues will be able to upload all sorts!
[12:46:35] <tybenz> johnbender: ping
[13:10:11] <agcolom> tybenz: Hi! I've updated jQuery 1.7.2 to 1.8.2 in themeroller, but it's still showing 1.7.2 (when you press the download button). does it need to be redeployed or something to get the new changes in, or did I not change this in the right place? (I changed https://github.com/jquery/web-jquery-mobile-theme-roller/blob/master/version.php)
[13:10:31] <tybenz> agcolom: oh yeah i saw that you had made that change.
[13:10:50] <tybenz> agcolom: yeah. theres a control page where i can update the server with the latest from master
[13:10:56] <tybenz> i'll do that today
[13:11:58] <tybenz> agcolom: ok. it should be updated now
[13:12:58] <agcolom> tybenz: thank you!!!!!
[13:14:06] <agcolom> tybenz: oh yes! it's in!!!!! Fantastic! I'll be able to finish my tutorial for the learn site!!!!! Thank you so much!
[13:16:39] <toddmparker> agcolom: saw the image upload, very cool
[13:16:48] <toddmparker> hey tybenz 
[13:17:06] <toddmparker> xavier is ready to take over TR if you want to work with him
[13:18:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker: whats your oppinion of a push mode for range https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5355#issuecomment-11146179?
[13:18:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i personally dont like it i think it will be a big usability issue when trying to set a narrow range
[13:19:58] <agcolom> hey toddmparker ! 
[13:23:29] <toddmparker> hey agcolom 
[13:23:44] <toddmparker> i don't think we should push arschmitz 
[13:24:04] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ok that was my feeling as well 
[13:24:08] <toddmparker> i know scott_gonzalez is going to make UI's slider work like yours - they just stop when they collide
[13:24:20] <toddmparker> so you can just say it's consistent with UI
[13:25:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker: oh is ui re doing theirs?
[13:25:57] <tybenz> toddmparker: ping
[13:26:56] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: no, we're not redoing ours. We're just going to fix the logic around which handle gets selected when they're on top of each other.
[13:27:09] <scott_gonzalez> The comment about click on the track is valid, you're not doing what UI does.
[13:27:19] <scott_gonzalez> UI selects the handle closest to where the click occurred.
[13:27:31] <scott_gonzalez> You're always selecting the most recently focused, which is confusing.
[13:28:47] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: right, should have been clearer. ui is tweaking the overlay behavior
[13:29:12] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: the tap handle > then track is used to support touchscreen devices w/no touch events
[13:29:19] <toddmparker> like WP7
[13:29:56] <toddmparker> if tapping the track always moved either the first or second, you could never move one of the handles
[13:30:18] <scott_gonzalez> It's not always first or second, it's whatever is closest to your tap.
[13:30:37] <toddmparker> oh, interesting
[13:30:43] <scott_gonzalez> Are you saying WP7 has no *move events?
[13:30:57] <scott_gonzalez> All you have is a click?
[13:30:58] <toddmparker> it's just mouse events
[13:31:05] <Wilto> Cheah.
[13:31:07] <toddmparker> same with webOS
[13:31:13] <toddmparker> fun.
[13:31:18] <scott_gonzalez> So why does it matter if there is no touch event?
[13:31:32] <scott_gonzalez> Aren't you reacting to the mouse events anyway?
[13:31:47] <toddmparker> yep
[13:31:56] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: that would be diffacult with how this works too because its not a two handled slider its two one handled sliders on top of eachother tapping the handle brings the track for that slider to the front
[13:32:15] <toddmparker> we're extending the single slider
[13:32:25] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Why is it two tracks?
[13:33:17] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: because its really just a wrapper on two of our normal sliders
[13:33:43] <agcolom> can we have an option to have the value either above or below the handle?
[13:33:58] <toddmparker> agcolom: I think we were going to make a demo for that
[13:34:12] <agcolom> cool!
[13:34:40] <scott_gonzalez> arschmitz: Sounds like that's going to be a limiting factor.
[13:34:58] <scott_gonzalez> Another issue I just saw is that mousedown on a handle can move it.
[13:35:52] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: thats in issue with slider in general not specificly the range slider but yes
[13:36:02] <agcolom> toddmparker: I've nearly finished a simple tutorial on how to use themeroller (for the learn site). Would you like to check first before I upload it? (I could email it to you when ready if you like)
[13:36:12] <toddmparker> sure agcolom 
[13:36:22] <agcolom> ok, will do.
[13:36:37] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: You can also use branches.
[13:36:49] <scott_gonzalez> Another reason that having a local server is useful :-)
[13:37:09] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: well, I need you to come to London and show me how to do all thins ;-)
[13:37:12] <agcolom> this ^
[13:38:04] <scott_gonzalez> I wouldn't mind a trip to London :-)
[13:38:57] <agcolom> that'd be great! In the mean time do you think the best think would be to create a branch?
[13:40:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker: agcolom: as far as inputs below slider this would have to be another option in the js couldnt be just css i dont think. do you think this is a common enough use case that you think we should support it?
[13:40:11] <scott_gonzalez> I guess that depends on whether toddmparker has a local setup :-P
[13:40:50] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: my local setup is hosed, new machine
[13:41:00] <toddmparker> for wordpress, right?
[13:41:22] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[13:41:38] <toddmparker> yeah. my older machine was set up. need to do that
[13:41:47] <toddmparker> how's the new house?
[13:42:17] <scott_gonzalez> full of boxes :-P
[13:42:31] <scott_gonzalez> It's nice; much bigger...
[13:42:47] <agcolom> arschmitz: that's the first idea that came to my mind when I 1st saw your demo... so not sure whether that'd be just me or more common
[13:42:57] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: and how's painting going?
[13:43:27] <scott_gonzalez> Painting's going well. We've got the living room and Mya's room done. About to start on Dylan's room and the play room.
[13:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> We've got all the window sills painted so we can hang blinds.
[13:43:57] <agcolom> I wish my house was big enough to have a play room!!!!
[13:44:07] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah i dont really know either all the other layout options are just classes this would have to be a data-attribute option thats why im asking if we think its worth it or not
[13:44:15] <scott_gonzalez> They've got 2 play rooms, one in the front of the house and one in the basement.
[13:44:43] <agcolom> they are very lucky! 
[13:44:47] <scott_gonzalez> They seem to think they've got 3 play rooms, because the room that would be a dining room (we probably won't use it for that) is full of toys.
[13:45:30] <agcolom> arschmitz: Personally, I think that'd be really good... But I don't realise how much work that represents 
[13:46:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker: uGoMobi: Wilto: scott_gonzalez: any input on having a data-attribute option to put the inputs below the slider?
[13:47:00] <toddmparker> i'd like to not add more options if we can avoid it
[13:47:13] <toddmparker> there already seems like a lot of permutions
[13:47:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: isn't this something people can do with overrides?
[13:47:32] <uGoMobi> I agree with not  adding options
[13:47:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont think it could be css but you might know a way i dont
[13:47:51] <scott_gonzalez> I've seen labels below/above handles like tooltips, but I think it'd be strange to have form controls moving around.
[13:47:59] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: agreed
[13:48:12] <uGoMobi> we add demos for tooltips
[13:48:13] <toddmparker> the demo _|Nix|_ had used tooltips that appeared as you dragged
[13:48:17] <toddmparker> yeah, that
[13:48:20] <uGoMobi> if people want that
[13:48:25] <agcolom> If it's easy enough for people to make that change themselves, then it'd be good to show how and then I'd be happy with that solution
[13:48:30] <arschmitz> yeah i like the tool tips idea a lot
[13:49:03] <uGoMobi> so I think we shouldn't make the position an option
[13:49:09] <toddmparker> if anything, i might want to look at the range slider and simplify the split vs. 2 input feature. just pick the best one
[13:49:18] <agcolom> yes, I meant the tooltips
[13:49:26] <toddmparker> think i like split best 
[13:49:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thats just a class
[13:49:41] <toddmparker> arschmitz: cool
[13:49:55] <arschmitz> yeah the only options it takes are the options for slider
[13:50:02] <toddmparker> great
[13:50:06] <arschmitz> because it passes them through to the sliders
[13:50:13] <arschmitz> all layout options are just classes
[13:50:32] <arschmitz> .ui-rangeslider-full and ui-rangeslider-split
[13:50:38] <agcolom> arschmitz: could you post the link to your demo again please?
[13:50:42] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: moving in is an ordeal. at least you have a shiny new house instead of a creaky old thing like mine
[13:50:50] <toddmparker> agcolom: http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/range.html
[13:51:01] <toddmparker> good. classes ftw
[13:51:10] <uGoMobi> I am in favor of split too
[13:51:32] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: I hate moving. We've done it way too many times.
[13:51:33] <uGoMobi> we have to see how we can make the slider full width if people want to hide the inputs
[13:51:45] <uGoMobi> so they can add the tooltip labels
[13:52:07] <uGoMobi> that should be a simple CSS override
[13:52:23] <scott_gonzalez> home -> college -> home -> college -> home -> college -> home -> college -> home -> rental house in PA -> apartment in PA -> house in PA -> apartment in NC -> house in NC -> house in PA
[13:52:23] <uGoMobi> but this is stuff for in the demo
[13:52:49] <scott_gonzalez> Mya's 4 and has lived in 4 places
[13:52:51] <arschmitz> agcolom:http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/range.html
[13:53:26] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: dang
[13:53:32] <agcolom> arschmitz: toddmparker thanks! 
[13:53:45] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: I know; thanksfully we're done.
[13:53:47] <uGoMobi> having the inputs inline with the label on smaller screens seems good to me
[13:53:50] <arschmitz> oh ha ha missed toddmparker had already dont it 
[13:53:54] <agcolom> what's the difference between the first series of split and the last 2 examples?
[13:54:23] <arschmitz> the last bunch are in a field contain
[13:55:09] <toddmparker> ah
[13:55:12] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: Also, buying and selling houses is expensive, especially in a shitty economy.
[13:55:20] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: i bet
[13:55:27] <arschmitz> agcolom: oh or do you mean the split vs split full ?
[13:55:29] <agcolom> arschmitz: ok. The last 2, the slider goes over the last input filed
[13:55:32] <toddmparker> looking to do the same soonish
[13:55:33] <agcolom> field^
[13:55:36] <scott_gonzalez> That 5-6% realtor fee is CRAZY
[13:55:48] <toddmparker> it's a scam but they all stick together
[13:56:37] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah i know on smaller screens i havent quite finished them when in a fieldcontain yet
[13:57:08] <toddmparker> maybe the full width option which places the inputs on the line next to labels should use mini inputs
[13:57:14] <toddmparker> looks way better
[13:57:28] <agcolom> arschmitz: I suspected that was the case :-) yes, also what is the diff between split and split full?
[13:57:49] <arschmitz> split vs split full nothing it just shows what happens if you add both classes
[13:57:51] <toddmparker> yeah, we can probably simplify 
[13:58:08] <toddmparker> if we all agree split looks better, let's just bake that in as the default style
[13:58:14] <toddmparker> so that's range
[13:58:21] <agcolom> arschmitz: ah that explains why I couldn't see any difference ;-) (visually)
[13:58:56] <toddmparker> if you add the full width option, that basically puts the inits next to the label, right?
[13:59:34] <toddmparker> for that, i'd style inputs to be as small as unobtrusive as we can
[13:59:41] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah basicly it makes the slider on its own line 
[13:59:48] <toddmparker> right.
[14:00:22] <toddmparker> so we have those two options, plus mini and the field contain variation 
[14:00:31] <toddmparker> think that's enough 
[14:01:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i don't think we should make anything mini unless you set mini
[14:01:47] <arschmitz> otherwise if you have a page of different inputs some will be inconsistant
[14:03:40] <toddmparker> arschmitz: well, these are a bit odd. we're placing the inputs next to the label
[14:05:01] <toddmparker> i think in that mode, we're emphasizing the slider and de-emphasizing the inputs. be nice to have a full sized slider without huge inputs next to the label. just hard to make it look good
[14:05:25] <toddmparker> just a thought
[14:06:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i can see your point im just thinking if you have other form elements with text inputs or another regular slider it would look weird that these didnt match
[14:08:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker: also one other thing. to make those mini if you want them mini and the slider full all you need to do is add ui-mini to the inputs
[14:08:40] <arschmitz> too make them not mini you would have to do a few overrides.
[14:09:07] <arschmitz> either way though people could override with css as they saw fit
[14:09:34] <arschmitz> but for documentation purposes its easier to say add this class then do this bunch of overrides ?
[14:10:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you have any thoughts on this i know you spent a bunch of time making form controls consistant?
[14:11:01] <uGoMobi> can i get a summary of "this"?
[14:11:27] <arschmitz> should the inputs on full width slider be mini by default even with a full size slider
[14:11:28] <uGoMobi> gseguin|away: make up your mind... in or out ;)
[14:12:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right hes blowing up a bunch of channels lol
[14:12:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: no matter small or large screen?
[14:12:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes
[14:13:01] <uGoMobi> I think smaller input look better with slider
[14:13:09] <uGoMobi> also for the regular slider
[14:13:24] <arschmitz> so should we make all inputs mini no matter what then?
[14:13:29] <arschmitz> for sliders?
[14:13:45] <uGoMobi> if we do this we should do it for all sliders
[14:13:52] <arschmitz> i think that would make more sense then just for full width 
[14:14:00] <uGoMobi> not just range slider
[14:14:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right for everything slider related the input always mini
[14:14:32] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and arschmitz - i think the mini input can be tied to the full width feature
[14:14:54] <toddmparker> normally, the input is next to the slider so matching the input and slider size makes sense
[14:15:20] <toddmparker> just thinking that in the full width mode, we place inputs next to the label and it starts to look out of balance
[14:15:48] <arschmitz> toddmparker actually the normal input is bigger then the slider handle making them mini i agree with uGoMobi: makes all sliders look better
[14:18:17] <arschmitz> toddmparker: making the inputs on regular slider mini makes them match the size of the slider handle i looks really good
[14:18:18] <toddmparker> ah, i see
[14:18:22] <toddmparker> i'd be ok with that
[14:18:32] <toddmparker> the inputs are secondary, but needed
[14:18:46] <toddmparker> so if we make 'em smaller, fine with me
[14:18:55] <toddmparker> more room for the slider
[14:18:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker: exactly and then it maintains consistancy too
[14:19:39] <toddmparker> so are you guys suggesting mini for all sliders, no matter what?
[14:19:52] <arschmitz> only for the inputs not the sliders
[14:19:57] <toddmparker> yes
[14:20:00] <arschmitz> yes
[14:20:06] <arschmitz> mini no matter what for inputs
[14:20:06] <toddmparker> +1
[14:20:19] <uGoMobi> yeah I think that's best
[14:20:25] <arschmitz> cool ill make the changes for this and slider then
[14:20:34] <toddmparker> and split as the way we display inputs + slider on one line?
[14:20:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am getting confused about all this full width
[14:20:59] <toddmparker> think we need a better name
[14:21:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol 
[14:21:22] <arschmitz> yeah i can see where it can be confusing 
[14:21:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the first "full width" example on your page is not something that will land in framework CSS right?
[14:21:43] <toddmparker> slider on it's own line, no text input next to it
[14:22:04] <uGoMobi> that only applies to small screen
[14:22:26] <arschmitz> the one with the inputs above?
[14:22:28] <uGoMobi> because there isn't going to be an option "full width"
[14:22:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[14:22:42] <uGoMobi> 7th from top
[14:23:12] <toddmparker> ah, ok
[14:23:14] <uGoMobi> if people want that they need to add it to custom CSS, so this is something for in the demo
[14:23:15] <toddmparker> confused there
[14:23:28] <uGoMobi> if you add tooltip labels
[14:23:37] <agcolom> arschmitz: bug to report!
[14:23:46] <arschmitz> agcolom: whats that?
[14:24:01] <uGoMobi> on desktop the slider and input(s) together will be 100% width
[14:24:19] <uGoMobi> on small screens slider 100% and inputs above the slider
[14:24:22] <agcolom> sorry, trying to reproduce...
[14:24:28] <toddmparker> seems like "split full" and the mini version below is close to the default
[14:24:40] <toddmparker> full will have mini inputs too
[14:24:52] <toddmparker> that right?
[14:24:59] <arschmitz> yes
[14:25:04] <toddmparker> ok. cool.
[14:25:07] <uGoMobi> yes
[14:25:25] <toddmparker> sounds like we need to get rid of the full width examples?
[14:25:45] <agcolom> here's the bug report: on the highlight (3rd example)
[14:25:47] <uGoMobi> well we can use the CSS to create the tooltip demo
[14:25:50] <agcolom> arschmitz: ^
[14:25:59] <uGoMobi> but they won't be part of the framework
[14:26:02] <toddmparker> i also think we might want to default to the fill highlight for rangesâ€¦thoughts?
[14:26:31] <arschmitz> this would be simple enough but i was just using sliders defaults
[14:26:34] <agcolom> slide the min to about 34, and the max to about 59
[14:26:34] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: then maybe we should change the default for slider as well
[14:26:43] <agcolom> then enter 67 in the max box
[14:27:05] <agcolom> (in FF)... now trying other browsers
[14:27:14] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: but I agree with hightlight true as default for range slider
[14:27:14] <arschmitz> agcolom: good catch ill have to look into that
[14:27:25] <arschmitz> ok i have to run everyone
[14:27:30] <toddmparker> agcolom: right, i saw that bug
[14:27:33] <uGoMobi> later arschmitz 
[14:27:52] <toddmparker> if you enter a # higher than the max, the fill shoots off the screen
[14:27:52] <arschmitz> ill try to get everything we talked about done this weekend
[14:27:53] <agcolom> happens on Safari as well
[14:28:02] <toddmparker> thanks arschmitz!
[14:28:17] <arschmitz> yeah its a bug when manually entering in anything i need to look at it
[14:28:26] <agcolom> as well. but here, it's still lower than the max which is 85 I think?
[14:28:41] <toddmparker> it's a logic bug, not a browser bug
[14:28:55] <toddmparker> btw - we've been discussing internals for panel and are looking at re-factoring to simplify a bit. right now, you can config the panel's position (left/right) and mode (reveal, push, overlay) per link which is powerful, but it adds a fair amount of code overhead. thinking about streamlining so you set these on the panel and the link just points to which panel to open.
[14:29:20] <toddmparker> i'm afraid that the link-based config we did for popups added a lot of complexity there too

[14:32:57] <agcolom> uGoMobi: you asked before about the commit messages... Please keep Docs as start for anything on the docs. I keep an eye on the commits on twitter and look at the ones that start with Docs: to see whether I need to add the new commit to the api docs... (as you did for the corners options in collapsibles and collapsible sets)
[14:33:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok np
[14:33:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: but we have docs and demos now
[14:34:05] <agcolom> oh yes, i'm only interested in docs I think for the api docs...
[14:34:08] <uGoMobi> I think toddmparker said we should use Demos
[14:34:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ah ok
[14:34:39] <agcolom> that'd make sense to use docs for docs and demos for demos, so that's fine...
[14:34:55] <uGoMobi> yeah sounds pretty straightforward :D
[14:35:02] <uGoMobi> I'll do that
[14:35:14] <agcolom> thank you :-)
[14:36:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I think for panel it will be fine to not have the possibility to specify options on the link
[14:40:07] <toddmparker> it really simplifies the code
[14:40:25] <toddmparker> we use deferreds and promises to keep track of the complexity now
[14:40:55] <toddmparker> agcolom: sounds like a plan
[14:41:34] <uGoMobi> I see panels as a more permanent part of a page, although they are hidden
[14:41:44] <uGoMobi> with popup that's different
[14:42:17] <uGoMobi> so I don't think there are many use cases in which you want to appear the panel differently depending on which link is clicked
[14:43:14] <toddmparker> yeah
[14:43:18] <toddmparker> agreed
[14:43:19] <uGoMobi> like a nav menu panel 
[14:43:23] <toddmparker> ok, i gott ahead home
[14:43:27] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:43:28] <toddmparker> have a great weekend all
[14:43:32] <uGoMobi> you too
[14:43:53] <agcolom> thank you and have a great weekend too. 
[14:44:07] <toddmparker> bye!
[14:44:15] <agcolom> bye :-)
[14:54:29] <_|Nix|_> OK, I think I'm going to give up https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2383 ... the return false is just going to have to stay.
[14:54:30] <bot-t> (29 hours 40 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ I know this might be a tall order but can I ask you to help me debug these sequence tests with the merge? I can't get them to reproduce consistently (I think there's a comment in there about the fact that they are order dependent?) and every other test in our suite is passing including the ones that overlap a lot of this stuff
[14:54:30] <bot-t> (29 hours 9 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ I wouldn't otherwise ask but I've been doing this for about a month 8 hours a day and, well, I'm tired of it :)
[14:55:34] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender NP.
[14:55:34] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[15:09:33] <Wilto> Headed out for the weekend, guys.

[15:09:40] <Wilto> Somebody fix that for me.
