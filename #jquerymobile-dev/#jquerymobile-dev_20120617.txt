[02:09:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] minor correction - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[02:30:59] <uGoMobi> agcolom: good morning Anne :-)
[02:31:08] <agcolom> Good morning Jasper,
[02:31:15] <agcolom> How are you?
[02:31:17] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I changed point 2 here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile#issues
[02:31:37] <uGoMobi> I am fine, thanks :-)
[02:31:48] <agcolom> yes, saw that...
[02:32:14] <uGoMobi> question... what do you think is better: latest code or current code
[02:32:20] <agcolom> latest
[02:32:26] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[02:32:40] <agcolom> current might mean for some the latest stable version
[02:33:07] <uGoMobi> haha... i thought maybe that goes for latest too
[02:33:17] <agcolom> I would use which uses latest code
[02:33:21] <agcolom> maybe ?
[02:33:37] <uGoMobi> ok
[02:34:21] <uGoMobi> i'll change the first part then
[02:34:23] <agcolom> quick question regarding Maurice's latest PR
[02:34:53] <uGoMobi> go ahead
[02:35:21] <agcolom> I'm still debating whether or not to keep Bar A or change to Bar "a"
[02:35:45] <agcolom> I think having too many " " on the JQM elements makes the page look more messy...
[02:36:11] <uGoMobi> yeah i agree
[02:36:25] <agcolom> so I think we should use swatch "a" but keep the elements called Button A
[02:36:28] <agcolom> etc...
[02:36:28] <uGoMobi> too many of those makes it less readable
[02:36:37] <agcolom> exactly. Cool Thanks,
[02:36:48] <agcolom> That's what I said in my comment...
[02:36:49] <uGoMobi> i think the most important part is consistency
[02:37:14] <agcolom> yes, so we've done the changes to use swatch "a"...
[02:37:20] <agcolom> and not swatch A
[02:37:56] <agcolom> Also, default should be free of any swatch mention, since it's default (i.e. not swatch specified)
[02:38:08] <uGoMobi> yes correct
[02:38:32] <uGoMobi> it's default theme
[02:39:32] <agcolom> yes.
[02:40:23] <agcolom> BTW has summer arrived for you? Still not reached the UK!
[02:40:42] <uGoMobi> yeah we have sunshine today :-)
[02:41:04] <uGoMobi> I think london saves all the good weather for the Olympics ;-)
[02:41:47] <uGoMobi> so i guess you stick to indoor swimming these days?

[02:45:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Minor change. Thanks for the feedback @agcolom - Jasper de Groot
[02:45:40] <agcolom> yes! It's really not great!
[02:46:17] <agcolom> I suppose we were in drought so it's good in that sense.... but still... a few sunny days wouldn't hurt!
[02:46:48] <uGoMobi> yeah i can imagine
[04:07:32] <agcolom> uGoMobi??
[04:07:40] <uGoMobi> yes Anne
[04:07:59] <agcolom> that last one you closed, I could reproduce... hold on...
[04:08:09] <agcolom> let me find it again...
[04:08:15] <uGoMobi> ah... then we can reopen :-)
[04:08:28] <agcolom> your fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/ZsKgD/
[04:09:50] <uGoMobi> what was the issue # ?
[04:09:52] <agcolom> ok, got to 2, go to 1 slide the slider, go to 2, the highlight is gone and you can't close the dialog
[04:10:00] <agcolom> checking...

[04:10:39] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[04:11:08] <agcolom> you want me to comment with these findings?
[04:12:36] <uGoMobi> aha... you are right... see it here now too
[04:13:16] <agcolom> I've updated the comment...
[04:13:20] <uGoMobi> yes please comment so we have link to the fiddle there
[04:13:29] <uGoMobi> oh ok, thanks :-)
[04:16:26] <uGoMobi> agcolom: already see the problem
[04:16:48] <uGoMobi> I should have looked better when I updated his test page to latest code
[04:17:11] <agcolom> well the sequence is very specific so easy to miss!
[04:18:49] <uGoMobi> I should have looked better at hit code... he uses same ID's for sliders
[04:19:37] <agcolom> ah! of course!
[04:19:58] <agcolom> Typical! how can people expect this to not cause problems!
[04:21:15] <uGoMobi> but unfortunately changing that doesn't fix all :-(
[04:22:08] <agcolom> yes, I tried also!
[04:23:31] <agcolom> I've added a comment: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3887
[04:23:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3887 on jquery-mobile (borego; 2m, 3w ago): Slider bar disappears after dialog in multi-page document
[04:24:39] <uGoMobi> he has page 2 and page 1 (logical order, errmm) with data-role="page" but the links to each pages have data-rel="dialog"  ... i think that is causing the issue
[04:25:09] <agcolom> Ah, well spotted
[04:25:11] <uGoMobi> page 2 is opened as regular page and remains in the DOM... when you then link to it again with data-rel is dialog
[04:25:49] <uGoMobi> i think the framework then tries to open the page again but this time as dialog
[04:26:01] <uGoMobi> so you have the same page twice in the DOM maybe
[04:26:18] <uGoMobi> i have to give that a look
[04:26:18] <agcolom> yes, once as a page and once as a dialog?
[04:26:26] <uGoMobi> yes exactly
[04:26:54] <agcolom> This would explain why this does not happen with the other page
[04:27:08] <agcolom> (which is not opened as a normal page)
[04:28:40] <agcolom> time to prepare lunch....
[04:29:11] <uGoMobi> ok enjoy lunch
