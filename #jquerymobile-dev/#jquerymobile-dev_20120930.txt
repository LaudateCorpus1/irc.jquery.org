[14:43:32] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Hi, would you like to keep the examples on this page as October 2010 or would you like to change the year to 2012? (I suppose 2010 shows when this was created, but 2012 would make things look more recent... Up to you really. I don't mind either was but wanted us to think about it....)
[14:43:47] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-formatting.html is the page I was talking about!
[15:05:54] <agcolom> either way ^ not either was!
[15:06:31] <agcolom> Goodnight - it's 11pm in London....
