[02:23:42] <frequent> uGoMobi: hey
[02:24:03] <uGoMobi> hey frequent 
[02:24:26] <frequent> so what do have up your sleeve for buttonMarkup in 1.4? :-)
[02:24:43] <uGoMobi> remove it :)
[02:25:04] <frequent> :-D
[02:25:13] <uGoMobi> we want to simplify markup
[02:25:18] <frequent> ok
[02:25:20] <uGoMobi> also less JS addClass stuff
[02:25:29] <uGoMobi> and do more with just CSS
[02:25:56] <uGoMobi> now a simple button has like 3 wrappers
[02:26:02] <frequent> so no more <div.ui-btn><span ui.btn-inner><span.ui-icon></span><span.ui-btn-text></span></span></div>?
[02:26:11] <uGoMobi> exactly
[02:26:20] <uGoMobi> try to just use the native element
[02:26:39] <uGoMobi> there probably will be exceptions
[02:26:48] <frequent> I did a few JQM elements with just "one" element and a ton of CSS
[02:26:48] <uGoMobi> like input type="button"
[02:26:52] <frequent> button can do
[02:27:10] <frequent> should I dig this up?
[02:27:20] <uGoMobi> but we can handle that exception in the button widget
[02:27:27] <uGoMobi> frequent: yeah sure
[02:27:36] <frequent> even worked on IE8... 
[02:27:52] <uGoMobi> did you use :before / :after for icons?
[02:27:53] <frequent> so 1.4 backward compatability will be kind of...
[02:27:58] <frequent> yes
[02:28:00] <uGoMobi> or inserted a span
[02:28:01] <frequent> I think.
[02:28:02] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[02:28:08] <frequent> no :before/:after
[02:28:20] <frequent> no DOM manipulation, because I could not access the DOM
[02:28:24] <uGoMobi> ok
[02:28:34] <frequent> so I needed to add all the CSS to a single element
[02:29:47] <uGoMobi> if we just style a single element people can just add the class
[02:30:12] <frequent> I will find the code and post an example
[02:30:21] <uGoMobi> great thanks
[02:30:55] <uGoMobi> not sure yet what we should do with backward compatibility
[02:31:20] <uGoMobi> we could use the data- attr as selector in the CSS
[02:35:49] <frequent> hm. I sure like the idea of less code...
[02:37:26] <uGoMobi> yeah me too... will really improve performance
[03:29:27] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15mrextreme opened issue #5838: Inline select is not inline  02http://git.io/qTZt8Q
[06:19:08] <frequent> uGoMobi_: http://bit.ly/10uxi8Q
[06:20:01] <uGoMobi_> cool
[06:20:24] <uGoMobi_> frequent: in most cases we can keep it simple like that
[06:20:27] <frequent> have not tried on mobile devices, but IE8 was ok
[06:21:07] <frequent> JQM will be skinny...
[06:21:22] <frequent> without all the wrapper-els :-)
[06:21:49] <uGoMobi_> frequent: we are going to improve the C-grade styling
[06:21:59] <uGoMobi_> and degrade older browsers
[06:22:08] <frequent> sounds good, too
[06:22:09] <uGoMobi_> so we can make changes like this
[06:22:48] <frequent> will you do the same to <input>s and alike?
[06:23:11] <uGoMobi_> well input type button will be a little problem
[06:23:14] <frequent> ... forgot which elements get buttonMarkup
[06:23:20] <uGoMobi_> because you can't use :before
[06:23:25] <frequent> hm.
[06:23:37] <uGoMobi_> almost all widgets use buttonMarkup
[06:23:38] <frequent> The code from the example I used on <button>
[06:23:42] <uGoMobi_> listview, slider, etc etc
[06:23:44] <frequent> that works
[06:23:56] <uGoMobi_> yeah because button has content
[06:24:01] <frequent> hm...
[06:24:03] <uGoMobi_> input type button only has value
[06:24:17] <uGoMobi_> but we could wrap only that one in the button widget
[06:24:44] <uGoMobi_> select is going to be a bit difficult too
[06:25:39] <frequent> ok... input really has no content... darn. :-)
[06:25:53] <uGoMobi_> but goal is to use just the native elements as much as possible
[06:27:23] <frequent> yes, I will try to see where an icon could be stuck onto an input... :-)
[06:27:46] <frequent> must be a way to cheat
[06:27:47] <uGoMobi_> yeah that are nice challenges
[06:27:50] <uGoMobi_> :)
[06:28:28] <frequent> ok. talk to you later. Stuff to do.
[06:28:33] <uGoMobi_> ok later

[07:03:33] <toddmparker> morning
[07:04:09] <toddmparker> hey - i just checked the API docs and we currently list the refresh method for column toggle 
[07:04:10] <toddmparker> http://api.jquerymobile.com/table-columntoggle/
[07:04:20] <toddmparker> http://api.jquerymobile.com/table-columntoggle/#method-refresh
[07:04:40] <toddmparker> and reflow
[07:04:41] <toddmparker> http://api.jquerymobile.com/table-reflow/#method-refresh
[07:05:14] <toddmparker> so unless those docs were added *after* 1.3.0 was released, we need to fix this for 1.3.1
[07:05:41] <uGoMobi_> morning toddmparker
[07:05:47] <toddmparker> hi uGoMobi_ 
[07:05:56] <uGoMobi_> I suggest we review frequent's PR today
[07:06:00] <toddmparker> just checked panel and a refresh method isn't listed there
[07:06:01] <toddmparker> http://api.jquerymobile.com/panel/
[07:06:05] <uGoMobi_> and try to get the table refresh in 1.3.1
[07:06:15] <frequent> be my guests
[07:06:39] <toddmparker> yeah, i think we need to push out 1.3.1 until we we land a temporary way to add refresh to the two table plugins
[07:07:05] <arschmitz> frequent did you update your pr to the widget method nix pushed?
[07:07:06] <toddmparker> funny we spent all this time talking about server and didn't check to see if refresh had actually be documented as part of the API
[07:07:12] <toddmparker> johnbender ^
[07:07:32] <frequent> arschmitz: yup
[07:07:38] <toddmparker> frequent: looks like your PR will be a big help
[07:07:42] <uGoMobi_> for panels the missing refresh method is a less big issue
[07:07:44] <frequent> cool
[07:07:45] <arschmitz> dont still have old one do you?
[07:07:56] <frequent> arschmitz: me?
[07:08:00] <uGoMobi_> (only for frequent and his dynamic toolbars) ;-)
[07:08:05] <arschmitz> because switching to widget for 1.3.1 would be a big api break
[07:08:14] <frequent> :-)
[07:08:17] <toddmparker> so as i understand it, we need to implement refresh differently in 1.3-stable because they aren't "proper" extensions, right?
[07:08:22] <arschmitz> yes
[07:08:36] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: agree re: panels
[07:08:38] <arschmitz> Also just noticed master is 100% broken in ie8 right now
[07:08:47] <toddmparker> what?!
[07:08:49] <frequent> arschmitz: should still have it. 
[07:08:53] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: yeah I saw it too
[07:09:02] <uGoMobi_> already commented on the change that broke it
[07:09:05] <arschmitz> frequent cool we cant use extension method for 1.3.1 but can for 1.4
[07:09:15] <uGoMobi_> IE7 and IE9 are broken to on master
[07:09:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: awesome
[07:09:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ie9 is fine for me?
[07:09:35] <uGoMobi_> DAMMIT johnbender 
[07:09:39] <arschmitz> been on it all morning
[07:09:42] <toddmparker> yeah, broken
[07:09:44] <uGoMobi_> try a panel arschmitz 
[07:10:04] <arschmitz> GAH!
[07:10:08] <toddmparker> there is an error
[07:10:09] <uGoMobi_> :)
[07:10:38] <uGoMobi_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/d9da6a77291fdc42a20996aa62e720949a58a84c#commitcomment-2925845
[07:11:18] <arschmitz> Frequent if you could submit a second pr with the 2 different refresh methods that would be a huge help because we need to do it both ways for different versions
[07:11:27] <toddmparker> ok, we'll have johnbender look at that when he gets in
[07:12:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i saw same error its strange though i dont see anything wrong there to cause unexpected identifier
[07:12:31] <toddmparker> arschmitz and uGoMobi_ - is the plan to implement both refresh approaches in one swoop or should I make new issues for the 1.3-stabel refresh?
[07:12:46] <frequent> arschmitz: ok will do a separate PR (that should at least give me a git yellow-belt...). Will be sometime tonight (my time)
[07:13:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker: for the issue its really symantics i guess they both need it they just need to be done differently but its the same issue either way
[07:13:33] <arschmitz> frequent thanks that will be a big help
[07:13:46] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: I don't know but I suggest we re-open the ticket after closing it with the fix for 1.3.1
[07:14:05] <arschmitz> doh i see the error in the chage from johnbender
[07:14:26] <toddmparker> so same issues?
[07:15:25] <arschmitz> ill fix the ie issue right now its just a missing bracket strange that it works at all or passes lint!
[07:15:51] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: i don't see the issues for those missing refresh methods
[07:15:59] <toddmparker> just looked thru 1.4 tickets
[07:16:06] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker 1.3.2
[07:16:14] <uGoMobi_> you can't miss the label :)
[07:17:15] <toddmparker> ah
[07:17:25] <toddmparker> I feel like these are vague
[07:17:59] <toddmparker> think we should make new issues that say "table: column toggle needs refresh method" and same for reflow. link these tickets and close
[07:18:11] <toddmparker> what do you think?
[07:18:33] <arschmitz> +1
[07:19:15] <arschmitz> just note in the ticket that its needed for 1.3.1 and 1.4 and close once its in both
[07:19:34] <frequent> arschmitz: I would go with that, because than it's easy to PR

[08:12:22] <arschmitz> frequent whats up?
[08:12:30] <frequent> arschmitz: http://bit.ly/11HxVx4 (search for "filterview" in jqm.js). It's still basic and I'm trying to get everything to work, but I would like to know if I'm on the right track "widget-wise".
[08:12:39] <toddmparker> oh good, just the normal oddness
[08:12:41] <frequent> (I do have a version using jQuery...) :-) 
[08:13:56] <arschmitz> frequent in widgets you should no use .on
[08:14:04] <arschmitz> use this._on
[08:14:29] <frequent> ok
[08:14:44] <arschmitz> http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#method-_on
[08:14:58] <arschmitz> it preserves the refrence to this so you dont need var self = this;

[08:17:20] <arschmitz> yes
[08:17:29] <frequent> ah.
[08:17:37] <arschmitz> as long as your ok with it calling the parents method when you dont know for sure what it is
[08:17:54] <arschmitz> in build you define a function with in the build method
[08:18:01] <arschmitz> you should make this a private widget method
[08:18:12] <frequent> noted.
[08:18:18] <arschmitz> that way it can be extended or modifieded
[08:20:36] <arschmitz> same with the setKids

[10:13:52] <johnbender> arschmitz: ping
[10:13:57] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi_: toddmparker: what did I break?!?!
[10:14:06] <johnbender> scrolled up to see the .default
[10:14:12] <arschmitz> johnbender: i fixed it already
[10:14:15] <johnbender> arschmitz: thanks
[10:14:16] <arschmitz> yup
[10:14:17] <johnbender> sorry
[10:14:22] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: panels are broken on IE
[10:14:33] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: arschmitz: same thing?
[10:14:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you check that since i fixed?
[10:14:51] <uGoMobi_> double checking now
[10:15:25] <arschmitz> johnbender: is it going to effect anything else where not being able to do .default? having to use array notation?
[10:15:38] <johnbender> arschmitz: let me look at the commit
[10:15:50] <arschmitz> johnbender: was also thinking maybe renaming transitionDefault or something might be better
[10:15:57] <uGoMobi_> yeah, still broken
[10:16:14] <uGoMobi_> they are always visible
[10:16:28] <uGoMobi_> the panels that is
[10:16:35] <uGoMobi_> but at the bottom of the screen
[10:16:50] <arschmitz> ok
[10:17:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they are showing up where ever they are in markup 
[10:17:44] <arschmitz> some top some bottom
[10:18:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so weird i have a site im working on thats on master
[10:18:34] <arschmitz> and panels are fine
[10:18:44] <arschmitz> but on view they are not

[10:51:30] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi_: toddmparker___: the base tag support property setup/change is ready to be merged
[10:51:52] <johnbender> arschmitz: uGoMobi_: toddmparker___: this is almost certainly going to break something so I'm wondering when I should do that
[10:52:16] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: great, shall we merge after 1.3.1 release?
[10:52:42] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: I thought we were releasing from the stable branch o.O
[10:52:52] <johnbender> are we not doing that anymore ?!?!
[10:52:53] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: yes we are
[10:52:56] <johnbender> zomg
[10:53:03] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: you're scaring me
[10:53:08] <uGoMobi_> but if you want to fix a bug you work on master
[10:53:16] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: it's a feature
[10:54:02] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: it was more because you said it would probably break something
[10:54:27] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: it's just hard to test without an app that makes heavy use of odd base refs etc
[10:54:38] <uGoMobi_> ah ok
[10:54:42] <johnbender> it's something we need to live with
[10:54:49] <johnbender> actually I'll go back and find the issue
[10:54:52] <johnbender> get those folks testing

[12:54:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi: arschmitz: so in IE the panels are still broken?
[12:54:44] <arschmitz> johnbender: seems that way
[12:55:05] <johnbender> arschmitz: is it any version of IE in particular
[12:57:09] <arschmitz> i think both 8 and 9
[13:06:12] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: IE7-9 (I didn't test IE10)
[13:06:25] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: got it
[13:06:30] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: I'll hop on browserstack
[13:07:52] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: can you test something on your iPhone5 / Mobile Safari?
[13:12:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: where is the public master version of our docs living these days :(
[13:12:48] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/
[13:12:52] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: thanks 
[13:13:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: I feel so exceptionally lame for not knowing that UGH
[13:13:27] <uGoMobi_> lol
[13:13:39] <uGoMobi_> all those changes... pfff ;)
[13:24:05] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: well I can reproduce it but I have no clue how to diagnose it
[13:25:03] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: I can take a look tomorrow
[13:25:15] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: debugging IE on browserstack is... well, not easy :)
[13:25:22] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: no worries I'm going to monkey around with it some more
[13:25:33] <johnbender> I have a digital ocean instance with jqm on it so I should be able to handle it
[13:25:45] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: hmm
[13:25:49] <johnbender> need to install php though :(
[13:26:00] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: I'll give it a whirl
[13:27:50] <uGoMobi_> johnbender: ok, I am going to call it a day soon but just leave a message if you want me to look at something tomorrow
[13:28:13] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: cool I think it would be good for me to take this one in any case
[13:28:25] <johnbender> uGoMobi_: it would be good to get familiar with the panels
[13:29:35] <uGoMobi_> yeah, they are popular :)
[13:30:09] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: I wanted to ask if you could test http://jsbin.com/atarer/22 on iPhone 5 / Safari
[13:30:29] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: see https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5764#issuecomment-15788411
[13:32:30] <uGoMobi_> ok that's it for me... later all!
