[02:17:22] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #226: STILL FAILING in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/226/
[02:46:56] <uGoMobi> morning
[02:48:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping!
[02:49:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the source view issue can be seen here http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/swipe/swipe-list.html
[02:49:23] <uGoMobi> it is because we use multipage template there
[02:50:33] <uGoMobi> open the swipe list demo page > refresh > go back to intro page > view source
[03:05:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[03:05:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have since reproduced it.
[03:06:16] <_|Nix|_> Well, bot-t is taking a break ...
[03:06:30] <_|Nix|_> I should've gotten johnbender's message by now ...
[03:06:36] <uGoMobi> morning _|Nix|_ 
[03:06:51] <uGoMobi> yeah bot-t is a slacker sometimes
[03:07:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The thing is I collect the unenhanced html and I store it in a variable.
[03:07:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll have to check how the enhanced html ends up in that variable.
[03:07:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What exactly does that refresh button do?
[03:08:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just refresh... same as F5
[03:08:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[03:08:35] <uGoMobi> at least that is the idea
[03:09:18] <uGoMobi> onclick="window.location.reload()"
[03:09:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: A similar thing happens when you refresh while looking at a city in the city demo and then go back. The HTML on the main page is empty.
[03:10:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... but that's because the main page is not the start page. It gets AJAXed in, and when that happens, only the first page of the document gets AJAXed in, and the HTML in the source view is the second page in that document.
[03:10:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that demo use single pages but i don't think ajax is set to false
[03:10:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right
[03:10:52] <uGoMobi> i was mistaken
[03:11:07] <uGoMobi> it uses multipage template too
[03:11:28] <uGoMobi> for the markup source view
[03:11:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess in the swipe-list demo case, the page is accessible when the view source gets created, but it's already enhanced, because that's the first page in the history.
[03:13:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. The swipe-list demo page is the second page in swipe-list.html ...
[03:13:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, when you refresh while looking at the demo, everything gets reloaded, and the first page in swipe-list.html never gets created.
[03:14:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess the view source currently assumes that the demos are on the same page as the view source button.
[03:14:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and when it does get created, it fetches the HTML from the second page which is, of course, enhanced by then.
[03:15:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[03:15:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I guess you can't start with the demo and then look at the source.
[03:18:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can specify of which element you want to show the html markup of, but of course the markup has to be in the dom
[03:18:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Which will not be the case if you're AJAX-ing in a multipage document and the markup is the second page.
[03:19:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: In the case of the city demo, we could simply make the back link non-AJAX.
[03:19:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah 
[03:19:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then it would load a new instance of jQM as if you had gone to it from the main demo page.
[03:20:25] <uGoMobi> yup
[03:20:35] <_|Nix|_> OK, so one down.
[03:21:06] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Old build #132: FAILURE in 1 hr 3 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Old/132/
[03:21:06] <_|Nix|_> Actually, let's see if that works.

[03:27:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: did it work?
[03:27:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well I guess so since you pushed the change :)
[03:29:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Check it out on http://jquerymobile.com/test just to make sure.
[03:29:29] <_|Nix|_> That doesn't fix the swipe list demo though ...
[03:30:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: swipe page demo works fine now... nice
[03:30:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: indeed, that's different issue

[04:55:19] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[04:55:38] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[04:56:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: with that pr from changsuk... We decided we liked it but wanted to change the name they used right?
[04:56:59] <arschmitz> that it sould be $.mobile.window instead of $.mobile.$window
[04:57:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I did a quick replace to test that but didn't work out
[04:57:54] <arschmitz> what didnt work out?
[04:58:22] <uGoMobi> I get undefined errors
[04:58:51] <arschmitz> hmm probably missed a replacment somewhere or something?
[04:59:50] <uGoMobi> i simply replaced $.mobile.$window by $.mobile.window in all JS files
[04:59:56] <uGoMobi> and same for document
[05:00:17] <arschmitz> did it work properly before the replacement?
[05:00:26] <uGoMobi> yes
[05:00:38] <uGoMobi> well I there was one problem in the PR
[05:00:43] <uGoMobi> in vmouse
[05:01:18] <uGoMobi> but that is fixed in the branch
[05:01:36] <uGoMobi> maybe search/replace isn't the way to go here
[05:01:55] <uGoMobi> have to see what's causing the error
[05:01:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: must be something like that because $.mobile.window is perfectly valid and works
[05:02:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if they had a errant space somewhere or something you would miss some
[05:03:34] <uGoMobi> maybe the problem is where the var is defined
[05:03:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe 
[05:04:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i havent looked closely yet where is it being defined?
[05:06:26] <uGoMobi> in mobile.core.js
[05:07:08] <arschmitz> ahh thats probably the problem
[05:07:19] <uGoMobi> $window: $( window ),
[05:07:35] <uGoMobi> should become window: $( window),
[05:07:48] <uGoMobi> but window is reserved name
[05:07:50] <arschmitz> im looking at index.php and core is the 14th file
[05:08:16] <uGoMobi> don't you think that's gonna be a problem?
[05:09:20] <uGoMobi> well seems to work fine
[05:09:27] <uGoMobi> just changed it
[05:09:53] <arschmitz> yeah that works fine i just test
[05:09:54] <arschmitz> ed
[05:10:08] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/631/edit
[05:13:05] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06pr-5404: 02http://git.io/UkLCvQ
[05:13:05] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06pr-5404 149bbc3fd 15Jasper de Groot: Changed name of the $.mobile.$window / $document variables (removed $ sign).
[05:13:53] <arschmitz> sweet ^^
[05:14:20] <arschmitz> uGoMob: if i recal when i set of the jsperf for this change wasent it like an 80% difference lol?
[05:14:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't remember but it was high percentage for sure
[05:15:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: as for the other change mentioned in the email while its not all jQueryish i dont see any problem with it if its faster. We do it in plenty of places already
[05:15:59] <uGoMobi> yeah true
[05:17:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: found my jsperf http://jsperf.com/jquery-window-vs-window
[05:17:45] <arschmitz> i should set one up for the case in the email to get an idea on the impact for that also
[05:21:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: had to look twice... it's operations per second... at first i thought it was much slower
[05:22:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol yeah 
[05:22:19] <arschmitz> such a massive improvment its crazy
[05:34:14] <uGoMobi> pff I am having problems with phantomjs again :(
[05:34:33] <uGoMobi> want to run all tests on that branch
[05:35:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: looks like the second one is browser dependant :( way faster in chrome slower in firefox
[05:35:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it was about the support test with fakebody right?
[05:36:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for sure such a massive change it needs the full tests
[05:36:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes though i think he was generalizing about creating elements in general
[05:37:30] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:37:49] <uGoMobi> like you said.. we already use that approach on many places
[05:40:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so i think my first firefox test was an annomoly i ran it two more times and was faster both
[05:40:56] <toddmparker_> morning all
[05:41:04] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker:
[05:41:11] <toddmparker_> hey arschmitz 
[05:42:13] <toddmparker_> thanks for looking at that PR arschmitz and uGoMobi 
[05:42:24] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker_ 
[05:42:25] <toddmparker_> 80% perf increase?
[05:42:26] <toddmparker_> dang
[05:42:31] <arschmitz> yeah 
[05:42:35] <arschmitz> http://jsperf.com/jquery-window-vs-window
[05:42:43] <arschmitz> its crazy
[05:43:22] <toddmparker_> that's great
[05:43:37] <arschmitz> im running tests on his other suggestion in the email right now
[05:43:46] <toddmparker_> these tizen perf changes seem pretty good so far, nice
[05:43:50] <toddmparker_> oh, cool
[05:44:30] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: absolutly heres the suggestion in the email http://jsperf.com/nativeprepend-vs-jqueryprepend
[05:44:36] <toddmparker_> sorry i missed yesterday. i had a full day rwd training session at lego yesterday. i have been a bit distracted pulling that together but now I'm back
[05:44:54] <arschmitz> a bit more browser dependant but still an improvment
[05:45:09] <toddmparker_> much better on chrome
[05:45:28] <toddmparker_> i'm going to hop on the T in a sec but will be on a bit later
[05:45:40] <toddmparker_> seems like we're close on zach's panel tests
[05:45:54] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah i fixed a bunch of bugs in the panel it self
[05:46:00] <toddmparker_> did you or uGoMobi have any luck tracking down the android webview oddness?
[05:46:05] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: rokk
[05:46:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: was looking at it but i dont think there is a fix yet
[05:46:51] <toddmparker_> ok, let me know if you want me to have someone tag in on that from filament
[05:46:59] <toddmparker_> i'll talk to you later!
[05:47:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: one other bug left thats making a problem for panels is the csstransformed test is broken
[05:47:06] <uGoMobi> have to see what is the downside of using position absolute instead of fixed there
[05:48:45] <uGoMobi> seems good idea to discuss this with Wilto and scottjehl______ 
[05:49:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think we lost him on the t but yeah i think your right
[05:50:08] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:59:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: These are PRs from the Samsung guys?
[05:59:52] <uGoMobi> brb switching to windows to see if phantomjs works on there
[05:59:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The $( window ) thing is indeed impressive.
[06:00:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes from the samsung guys
[06:01:03] <arschmitz> im finishing testing their suggestion in the email and its looking really good too
[06:02:09] <_|Nix|_> Very cool!
[06:02:45] <arschmitz> its looking like at least a 50% improvment on most platforms
[06:02:57] <arschmitz> firefox and ie seem to be the execption
[06:03:22] <arschmitz> http://jsperf.com/nativeprepend-vs-jqueryprepend
[06:03:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ^^
[06:07:21] <_|Nix|_> Dang! Not bad!
[06:07:57] <_|Nix|_> This supports johnbender's idea that jQuery should expose all the native element manipulations as public API.
[06:08:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[06:08:50] <_|Nix|_> That way we could take advantage of the insights as to how to make things work on all browsers without having to construct a ton of jQuery objects.
[06:08:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it also makes sense that doing this the native way would be faster
[06:09:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, but we expose ourselves to browser idiosyncracies that way.
[06:09:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: though thats not entirely true there are certain things that jQuery does faster
[06:10:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the jQuery events system is quicker im most situations
[06:11:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and yes there is obviously a reason to use jQuery for most things
[06:12:55] <_|Nix|_> This is pretty cool ...
[06:13:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: whats that?
[06:13:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: These PRs.
[06:13:58] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Yeah for sure
[06:14:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's a totally new angle ...
[06:14:29] <arschmitz> could net us some real performance gains if they keep coming up with stuff like this
[06:14:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[06:14:56] <arschmitz> i mean already has made some real gains but even more lol
[06:15:03] <_|Nix|_> Yeah :)
[06:15:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we should document $.mobile.window and $.mobile.document for people to use
[06:15:45] <arschmitz> since they are so much faster
[06:16:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait, is that merged yet?
[06:16:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: no i mean once it is
[06:16:19] <_|Nix|_> Right. Definitely.
[06:16:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: is running the full tests right now to make sure there are no problems
[06:16:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool!
[06:17:00] <uGoMobi> well I am first trying to get phantomjs work properly again
[06:17:21] <uGoMobi> I am back at the old issue... phantomjs timed out
[06:17:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you still have problems with that?
[06:18:07] <uGoMobi> I don't remember how we fixed it the first time
[06:21:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I have no problems with phantomjs
[06:22:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Make sure your ROOT_DOMAIN ends in a '/'
[06:22:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it does
[06:23:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was thinking that for the swipe-list.html demo we should add a third page which is never shown. It's a copy of the second page.
[06:23:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: And the data-demo-html="#id-of-third-page"
[06:24:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, unless you type in swpe-list.html#id-of-third-page, you will never see it.
[06:24:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We could even do data-demo-html="[data-html-demo]"
[06:25:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and then the source code HTML page would not have an ID, so it couldn't be deep-linked.
[06:25:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but we have to load in the dom to show the markup of the 3rd page in view source of 1st page
[06:25:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's no problem, because the third page and the first page are in the same document.
[06:25:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The demo page doesn't get AJAX-ed in like it does with the cities.
[06:25:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you load swip-list.html#demo-page directly, it will still load the first and the third page.
[06:26:11] <uGoMobi> ah ok, thought you meant a single page... was confusing it with the swipe page demo
[06:26:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, we don't have the AJAX problem in this case.
[06:26:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sounds like good workaround to me
[06:26:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll do the copying over. I'll use an ID, because otherwise it'll look weird in the source view.
[06:29:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... that did the trick.
[06:32:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I get errors when I try to open some demos in branch pr-5404
[06:32:30] <arschmitz> hmmm 
[06:32:30] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/pr-5404/docs/demos/
[06:33:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: somehow a bunch of $(window) got replaced with win it looks like
[06:34:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i see the issue
[06:34:42] <arschmitz> its what i mentioned before that its being defined in core and core is the 14th file when they are combined
[06:34:49] <arschmitz> so its undefined in everything before
[06:35:16] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/index.php#L21
[06:35:27] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/iPkHIg
[06:35:27] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14ac06920 15Gabriel Schulhof: Demos: Swipe list: Store a copy of the demo page that will not be used for demoing, but only for displaying its source code
[06:36:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so we either need to move where we are defining it or revert everything that comes before
[06:36:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nice... I will make same change in the dynamic popup demo which has the same issue
[06:36:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It should be defined in core, since core defines the $.mobile namespace.
[06:37:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, great!
[06:37:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good point!
[06:37:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats fine we will just need to not use it in all the files that come before it
[06:37:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Don't all files depend on the presence of the $.mobile NS?
[06:38:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Let's not revert if it means losing the performance benefit.
[06:38:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Better to try and define these things earlier.
[06:38:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its about source order
[06:39:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know. That's why we need to define these variables in the first file that gets included.
[06:39:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... if that makes sense.
[06:39:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm checking out the branch now.
[06:39:20] <arschmitz> lets see thats define.js
[06:39:53] <arschmitz> ok that seems a little too early after is ui widget factory dont want to mess with that
[06:40:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe in jquery.mobile.widget?
[06:40:51] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_^^
[06:40:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looking ...
[06:41:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's the earliest file using it?
[06:41:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im look at that now
[06:43:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: vmouse
[06:45:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and they're defined in core?
[06:45:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes
[06:46:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: everything that comes before core is new events and the page widget all stuff that does not depend on core 
[06:46:48] <uGoMobi> that explains the error i got in vmouse which i thought I had fixed with my first commit in that branch
[06:47:14] <_|Nix|_> I guess we'll have to defined these things inside the top-level immediate function.
[06:48:01] <_|Nix|_> I'll do it for vmouse.
[06:48:31] <uGoMobi> it seems like it's fine as long as you don't declare a variable like win = $.mobile.window
[06:48:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we will have to change how we define $.mobile in core so it doesnt get over written
[06:49:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: No. I'll define var $document = $( document ) in vmouse, because vmouse makes no assumption about the presence of the $.mobile NS.
[06:49:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's a very small performance sacrifice.
[06:49:40] <uGoMobi> in vmouse var $document = $.mobile.document was declared but removing that var and just use $.mobile.document in the code fixed it
[06:49:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah good point
[06:50:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Excellent point!
[06:50:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Much better solution!
[06:50:16] <_|Nix|_> But wait, no ...
[06:50:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Can't use $.mobile.document in the source, because that causes vmouse to depend on core.
[06:50:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it needs to be $document = $( document )
[06:50:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's bad. vmouse is supposed to be independent.
[06:50:49] <kinblas> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: FYI folks initially wanted vmouse so that is independent from mobile
[06:50:59] <_|Nix|_> kinblas: Exactly.
[06:51:05] <kinblas> so that it can be pulled out and used without that is
[06:51:07] <uGoMobi> aha
[06:51:11] <arschmitz> kinblas: yeah its still early lol wasent thinking
[06:51:23] <uGoMobi> didn't think of that either
[06:53:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. vmouse should be fixed. Any others?
[06:53:47] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we will need to do it in events/touch events/orientationchange
[06:54:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ those two should take care of it i think
[06:54:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll do it.
[06:55:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: cool
[06:55:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think if I make that change that'll basically restore those files to their original content :)
[06:56:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yes it should lol
[06:57:27] <gseguin> mornin'
[06:57:33] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[06:57:39] <arschmitz> gseguin: good morning
[07:06:01] <gseguin> uGoMobi, arschmitz: why without the $ sign?
[07:07:23] <arschmitz> gseguin: its already implied that it will be a jquery object since it $.mobile.widnow
[07:08:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Now I'm also having problems with phantomjs :(
[07:08:23] <uGoMobi>  _|Nix|_ on that branch or master?
[07:08:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: On pr-5404
[07:08:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: branch pr-5404 hangs on degrade-inputs
[07:08:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It hangs on zoom for me.
[07:08:57] <uGoMobi> same for you?
[07:09:01] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[07:09:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: zoom is the very first one.
[07:09:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Runs fine in Chrome.
[07:10:02] <gseguin> arschmitz: I don't agree. $.mobile.urlHistory is not a jQuery object for instance
[07:10:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm an idiot ... wrong ROOT_DOMAIN ...
[07:10:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: master results in timeout at push-state-disabled-tests.html
[07:10:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: We don't exactly have a hard-and-fast rule about storing jQuery objects in variables that start with a $ ...
[07:10:47] <arschmitz> gseguin: good point my own personal feeling is still that it should not have the $
[07:10:47] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Maybe we should introduce such a rule.
[07:11:10] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Does UI have such a rule?
[07:11:17] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ^ ?
[07:11:25] <arschmitz> gseguin because if it wasent a jquery object that would make no sense as you would just use window all by itself
[07:11:48] <arschmitz> but if there is some sort of actual convention for this then we should follow it
[07:11:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think gseguin has a point. $.mobile.window sounds like we copied window into it.
[07:11:53] <scott_gonzalez> Never use $
[07:11:55] <gseguin> arschmitz: true that
[07:11:58] <scott_gonzalez> HARD AND FAST
[07:12:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Mind letting us in on the rationale?
[07:12:51] <scott_gonzalez> Because we don't use Hungarian Notation anywhere.
[07:13:24] <wilto1> who’s hungarian what are we doing now
[07:13:35] <_|Nix|_> wilto1: I'm Hungarian.
[07:13:40] <uGoMobi> $Wilto
[07:13:44] <_|Nix|_> wilto1: ... but my notation isn't.
[07:14:13] <gseguin> lol
[07:14:26] <wilto1> If I’m reading this correctly, we are not to use any Hungarian currency from now on.
[07:14:28] <_|Nix|_> Well, alright ... I guess that settles it.
[07:14:54] <_|Nix|_> wilto1: Wouldn't want to, either. It's like 190 of them to USD$1 or some such.
[07:14:56] <wilto1> We talkin’ `$` in variables?
[07:14:56] <gseguin> ok so no $, that's cool
[07:15:03] <_|Nix|_> wilto1: Yeah.
[07:15:16] <gseguin> plus we gain 1 byte, SCORE !
[07:15:23] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:16:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz, uGoMobi: Running unit tests on the "reverts" now in pr-5404
[07:16:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nice
[07:16:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks
[07:16:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP. I wanna see this merged.
[07:16:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: me too its sooo much faster
[07:17:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: rangeslider unit tests output "157" ... kinda breaks the nice flow of testname .......... OK ...
[07:17:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when you test on phantomjs... do you see "Testing rangeslider/157    157... OK
[07:17:51] <uGoMobi> lol nice timing
[07:17:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ^
[07:17:55] <_|Nix|_> :)
[07:18:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: made that one lol :) 
[07:18:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess if it's 158 the Universe collapses into a singularity.
[07:18:28] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:18:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK. uGoMobi?
[07:18:45] <uGoMobi> I have no idea where it's coming from but I'll take a look
[07:20:09] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: gseguin: wilto1: not sure if maybe we should save for next weeks meeting but i think we should discuss the suggestion from the email from Changsuk as well
[07:20:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There was an email? A suggestion?
[07:20:48] * _|Nix|_ needs to catch up
[07:21:02] <_|Nix|_> Oh, there it is ...
[07:21:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats what that second jsperf i showed you was about
[07:21:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think we can reply that a PR for that is very welcome
[07:21:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that was my thinking my jsperf shows it clearly is a lot faster
[07:21:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: then we can review and test the PR like we do with this one
[07:22:01] <gseguin> +1
[07:22:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i agree i was just seeing if there was a dissenting oppinion
[07:22:27] <arschmitz> on that approach to creating elements in general
[07:24:33] <_|Nix|_> We also need to test for cross-browser correctness.
[07:24:54] <_|Nix|_> Does jQuery currently have any workarounds built into its prependTo implementation?
[07:25:43] <_|Nix|_> If so, we might want to get them to publish the bits of jQuery.fn.prependTo that deal with DOM elements as an API on its own.
[07:25:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: they still want to use prependto
[07:26:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, right, just construct the elements by hand.
[07:26:23] <_|Nix|_> NM then.
[07:26:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, avoiding the parsing of HTML is always a good idea.
[07:26:43] <arschmitz> and createElement is 100% crossbrowser as far as i know
[07:26:53] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. Not bad.
[07:27:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Things like $( "<div></div>" ) should be punishable by summary execution.
[07:27:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i already tested the approach in the js perf in ie8, ie9, android 4.1.1, firfox17, chrome 24, ios5 and ios6
[07:27:59] * _|Nix|_ is stepping up to the bullet-riddled wall ...
[07:28:23] <arschmitz> oh and cant forget android 2.3
[07:28:27] * _|Nix|_ refuses the blindfold ...
[07:28:53] * _|Nix|_ digresses ...
[07:28:54] <_|Nix|_> :)
[07:29:05] <_|Nix|_> Yaaay! Unit tests pass ...
[07:29:11] <arschmitz> Sweet!!!
[07:29:22] <_|Nix|_> K, so, like ... merge?
[07:29:40] <arschmitz> +1 for merge
[07:29:53] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 3 new commits to 06pr-5404: 02http://git.io/IJVcKA
[07:29:53] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06pr-5404 14472c08c 15Gabriel Schulhof: VMouse: revert, because we cannot depend on the $.mobile namespace
[07:29:53] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06pr-5404 144d10cea 15Gabriel Schulhof: orientationchange: revert, because we cannot depend on the $.mobile namespace, but keep using "win" instead of $( window ) in the body, because "win" is declared as $( window ) at the top of the module-enclosing immediate function
[07:29:53] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06pr-5404 14dd2bc93 15Gabriel Schulhof: touch: Revert, because we cannot depend on the $.mobile namespace, but assign $( document ) to a variable at the top of the outermost immediate function so it can be used inside the body of the module
[07:29:54] <_|Nix|_> Alright ... 
[07:31:22] <_|Nix|_> One more run of the tests, and I'll push the merge and duck.
[07:32:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the only downside i can see to the create element approach is code weight it adds a minimum of 1 line everytime generally probably 2 or 3  more 
[07:33:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We might want to take an intermediate approach: use JSON and a common constructor.
[07:33:33] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: good idea
[07:33:57] <_|Nix|_> Like: domSnippet = makeMyDOMSnippet( { a: { class: "myClass", href: "myHRef" } } );
[07:34:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i like that
[07:34:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We'd need to special-case things like children.
[07:34:32] <arschmitz> data attributes might be a little tricky but should work
[07:35:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We could also special-case that: { data: { theme: "a", positionTo: "window" } }
[07:35:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup that would work
[07:35:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: First and foremost of all, we should see whether making such a change is worth it. Are we really constructing complex enough objects in the library?
[07:36:07] <arschmitz> add it to the mobile namspace $.mobile.constructElement() or something
[07:36:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and will the resulting assembler be faster than the jQuery parser?
[07:36:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd call it makeDOM ...
[07:36:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For brevity ...
[07:36:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Might not even need to be public ...
[07:36:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... although it's useful ...
[07:36:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah but something that i think we need more discussion on 
[07:36:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... at first sight, anyway ...
[07:37:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: get johnbender: in on this and see what he thinks
[07:37:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can think of applications in custom select, slider, maybe even listview ... although listview already does everything "the hard way", I think.
[07:38:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its something we do in a number of places for sure
[07:38:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It would be interesting to see the performance penalty of using such a function inside buttonMarkup ...
[07:38:53] <_|Nix|_> Uh-oh ... unit test timeout when I merge with master.
[07:39:06] <_|Nix|_> I'll run it again in case it's spurious.
[07:39:18] <_|Nix|_> Not spurious ...
[07:39:52] <arschmitz> :(
[07:39:54] <_|Nix|_> Cannot read property 'document' of undefined ...
[07:40:23] <_|Nix|_> This is helping us uncover dependency problems.
[07:40:28] <arschmitz> sounds like something else needs to be reverted
[07:41:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep. js/jquery.mobile.fieldContain.js ...
[07:41:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: it should be defined by then??
[07:42:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nope. fieldcontain depends solely on jQuery.
[07:42:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i was just looking and realized that
[07:42:58] <arschmitz> its also only used once in that so no performance gain
[07:43:33] <_|Nix|_> We should totally ditch index.php and rely exclusively on requirejs ... 
[07:44:33] <_|Nix|_> Weird that didn't show up on the branch unit tests ...
[07:44:47] <_|Nix|_> Maybe because it's async loading ...
[07:44:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: must be
[07:47:04] <_|Nix|_> Next stop - degrade-inputs
[07:48:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Egads! degradeInputs adds to page widget options!
[07:49:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yuck!
[07:49:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: $.mobile.page.prototype.options.degradeInputs = { /* a whole pile of name: value pairs */ }
[07:49:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's the umbrella bug for the widget review?
[07:49:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i just look dosent even extend properly lol
[07:49:59] <arschmitz> just a sec
[07:50:42] <arschmitz> oh yeah just ended up making a label and keeping individual issues
[07:50:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right ... here's another :)
[07:50:59] * _|Nix|_ go file now
[07:51:00] <arschmitz> yup
[07:52:43] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #5418: degradeInputs: Adds options to page widget - move to defaults?  02http://git.io/czvY_w
[07:53:25] <toddmparker> hey all
[07:53:34] <arschmitz> hey toddmparker:
[07:53:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: degrade-inputs is exactly where phantomjs times out when I run the tests
[07:53:59] <_|Nix|_> Yo ho ho and a barrel of grog!
[07:54:09] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: welcome back
[07:54:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: get it to pass?
[07:54:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's because it doesn't depend on core so $.mobile.{document,window} are unavaible to it.
[07:54:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Re-running now.
[07:55:44] <arschmitz> toddmparker: so a few wrinkles were discovered with the pr from changsuk but fingers corssed _|Nix|_: just sorted out the last of them
[07:55:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: then I don't have a phantomjs issue :)
[07:56:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. phantomjs doesn't output JS errors :(
[07:56:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the timeout I get on master is with push-state-disabled-tests.html
[07:56:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: could have to do with that issue we are looking into
[07:56:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Reliably reproducably?
[07:57:04] <_|Nix|_> s/ca/cea/ ... I think ...
[07:57:06] <uGoMobi> every single time I run the tests
[07:57:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Interesting.
[07:57:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is it broken on the buildbot too?
[07:57:45] <uGoMobi> but wouldn't expect error with pushState disabled.. only with enabled
[07:58:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no it is not
[07:58:28] <uGoMobi> weird
[07:59:24] <_|Nix|_> Uh-oh ... page needs to depend on core, because it uses getInheritedTheme and pageContainer ... it doesn't.
[08:00:10] <_|Nix|_> ... and if I introduce the dependency, previous ones I reverted can also be re-introduced.
[08:00:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i guess you were right about dependancy issues
[08:00:40] <arschmitz> and discovering them
[08:00:47] <_|Nix|_> Yep.
[08:02:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we still wouldnt want the events to depend on core
[08:03:59] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono ... not talking about those ... but, like, degradeInputs ... that one can have $.mobile.{document,window}, because it depends on page, which, it turns out, depends on core.
[08:04:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh ok for sure on those
[08:06:35] <_|Nix|_> jquery.mobile.links.js ... 
[08:06:38] <_|Nix|_> Interesting ...
[08:07:10] <_|Nix|_> ... need to revert that one too ...
[08:10:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: too bad it would get us shot to do $.window and $.document lol
[08:38:13] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ping!
[08:38:34] <johnbender> uGoMobi: pong
[08:38:48] <uGoMobi> hey johnbender 
[08:39:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: what's up?
[08:39:04] <uGoMobi> do you have a moment to help me with an issue with rangeslider tests
[08:39:09] <johnbender> sure
[08:39:22] <_|Nix|_> OK ... tests pass without a hitch here.
[08:39:25] <uGoMobi> if you run the rangeslider unit test in phantomjs
[08:39:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: NICE!!
[08:39:43] <uGoMobi> it returns Testing rangeslider/157    157...... OK
[08:40:02] <_|Nix|_> OK ... merging ...
[08:40:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: should i duck to avoide the potential explosion lol ?
[08:40:33] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I can't figure out where that 157 is coming from... seems like it is a warning or something
[08:41:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: is there a branch I can look at or a PR?
[08:41:16] <uGoMobi> johnbender: it;s on master
[08:41:20] <johnbender> uGoMobi: kk
[08:41:32] <uGoMobi> the tests run fine in the browser
[08:43:47] <johnbender> uGoMobi: there's an errant console.log in there
[08:44:02] <johnbender> uGoMobi: `ack console.log tests/`
[08:44:15] <johnbender> or `grep -R "console.log" tests/`
[08:44:18] <uGoMobi> pfffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
[08:44:30] <johnbender> lolol
[08:44:43] <uGoMobi> I think it's time to dive in my cave
[08:45:16] <uGoMobi> it's full of console.logs :(
[08:45:19] <uGoMobi> sorryyy
[08:45:24] <uGoMobi> thanks johnbender !
[08:45:55] <johnbender> uGoMobi: np, as a side note that's how you debug when there's an issue in the phantom build that doesn't show up in the browser
[08:45:58] <johnbender> console.log :/
[08:46:33] <arschmitz> johnbender: debugging phantom is soooo fun lol 
[08:46:50] <johnbender> arschmitz: luckily it doesn't diverge from chrome very often
[08:46:55] <johnbender> rarely if ever
[08:48:12] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah i havent had any cases where i does i dont think. my issues have more been that i have a couple apps i built that manipulate other pages that do a lot of ajax and debugging those can be "fun"

[08:57:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: feel the speed ha ha ha 
[09:00:06] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:00:29] <uGoMobi> actually I had the feeling it was faster when testing on IE
[09:00:41] <uGoMobi> but not sure if that was just what I wanted to see
[09:01:02] <uGoMobi> need Wilto and his chrono to time the difference ;-)
[09:01:11] <arschmitz> jup JSWilto
[09:01:16] <uGoMobi> lol
[09:03:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: id almost gurantee its in my head but it does feel faster lol
[09:04:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the power of wishfull thinking
[09:04:17] <uGoMobi> it does :D
[09:04:38] <arschmitz> damn it Wilto_: where is your stopwatch your slacking?
[09:04:54] <Wilto_> Sorry! Pulled onto a client thing real quick.
[09:05:02] <Wilto_> Couple minutes.
[09:05:44] <arschmitz> Wilto_: lol we need you to do your JSWilto tests we discussed ha ha ( when your done )
[09:09:38] <uGoMobi> grunt test tests against core 1.6.4 and 1.8.2 by default... we should change that to 1.7.0 and 1.8.3 I think
[09:10:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think your right
[09:10:55] <uGoMobi> wait... I am not sure this is the default.. double check
[09:12:29] <uGoMobi> I think it tests against more versions
[09:12:47] <toddmparker> just finished catching up…great news that you landed that PR and uncovered some dependency issues
[09:12:53] <toddmparker> nice work guys
[09:13:19] <toddmparker> wherever we can find spaces to speed things up, let's go for it
[09:15:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm not sure how many of those places where we changed $( document ) or $( window ) to $.mobile.document resp. $.mobile.window were really super hot.
[09:16:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: But I guess it improved things for Samsung, so ...
[09:16:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and I know for a fact they're really keen on having devs write Tizen apps with HTML5, and web-ui-fw in particular.
[09:16:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... so they must really have seen a diff.
[09:19:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im really curious about the other suggestion and the best way to implement.
[09:20:15] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im thinking im going to make a really basic sample function like we talked about and test it to see 
[09:24:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... sounds like a good plan.
[09:27:10] <toddmparker> cool
[09:27:18] <toddmparker> grabbing lunch
[09:27:25] <toddmparker> be back in a bit
[09:30:27] <zachleat> @johnbender, is there anything else I need to do on this PR https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5412
[09:31:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: downside of the solution for swipe list demo markup source view is the id in the html source doesn't match the id in the JS source
[09:32:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: $( document ).on( "pageinit", "#demo-page", function() {
[09:32:37] <uGoMobi> where the html markup has an id of #sample-page
[09:32:38] <arschmitz> zachleat: once you decide its ready let me know and ill merge it for you so i can sort out the conflicts with the changes i made.
[09:33:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will think of something
[09:33:46] <toddmparker> arschmitz: i'd like to land panels today if we can
[09:34:02] <toddmparker> just a matter of getting some eyes on those tests
[09:34:13] <zachleat> @arschmitz I think it's good to go, just making sure that @johnbender was satisfied with my answer to his questions there
[09:34:20] <toddmparker> zachleat can help look at that android issue if uGoMobi can get him up to speed
[09:34:27] <johnbender> zachleat: checking
[09:34:50] <arschmitz> toddmparker: shouldnt be a problem let me know when and ill take care of it
[09:35:19] <johnbender> zachleat: was it necessary to move the QUnit.confi.autostart assignment to the top of the file?
[09:35:30] <johnbender> if it was just make a quick note on the pageinit binding as to why you're doing that
[09:35:42] <johnbender> so it's not confusing to someone else stoping in
[09:36:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: zachleat going to have dinner now, will be back in a bit and then we can look into panel Android WebView issue
[09:38:00] <zachleat> @johnbender as opposed to being inside the IIFE?
[09:38:20] <johnbender> zachleat: or right next to the binding
[09:38:24] <johnbender> code locality has value
[09:38:30] <johnbender> semantic value
[09:38:38] <zachleat> agree, I'll move it down there
[09:39:02] <johnbender> zachleat: cool, super nit pick but when it's a wierd thing we're doing then it's helpful for people looking at the code without the history/context
[09:39:20] <zachleat> yeah, no problem at all. That makes sense to me.
[09:41:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hmmm ...
[09:41:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Copy the JS as well.
[09:42:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: However, we need to render it inert first ...
[09:42:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess there's nothing preventing us from simply placing the text inside a <div> instead of a <script>
[09:42:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: s/text/code/
[09:42:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can still refer to it as data-demo-js="#id-of-div"
[09:43:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: isn't it just easier to not use a multipage template?
[09:43:22] <uGoMobi> I like to keep it simple
[09:43:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, yeah ... if you put the view source button on the demo page itself ...
[09:43:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... I also don't like the idea of copying code/markup/whatever like that.
[09:43:45] <uGoMobi> having to maintain code at different places increases chance for mistakes
[09:44:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and the innacuracy of the illustration.
[09:44:17] <uGoMobi> exactly
[09:44:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Come to think of it, we should do the same for the cities.
[09:44:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: There used to be a view source button on the page for each city.
[09:44:43] <uGoMobi> yes I removed that
[09:44:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We could add a note that the rest of the code can be found on the main page.
[09:45:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, the styling and the js.
[09:45:17] <uGoMobi> the idea is to have intro and source view on one page
[09:45:27] <uGoMobi> and the actual demo on seperate page(s)
[09:45:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know. I guess you're right, and in the case of the swipe list demo there is only one page, whereas in the case of the cities there are many.
[09:46:01] <uGoMobi> without source view buttons 
[09:46:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly... only downside is that all those pages need the scripts and styles in the head
[09:55:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Damn my makeDOM function is some how faster then native!
[09:55:49] <arschmitz> http://jsperf.com/makedom
[09:58:40] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: thats crazy i dont understand how it could be faster
[10:00:37] <zachleat> arschmitz: It unrolls those tests, you'd probably want to move your function declaration into setup
[10:01:12] <arschmitz> zachleat: thanks ill try that
[10:02:07] <zachleat> I believe it just manually repeats your code a bunch of times in a row, so your makeDOM function is getting initialized once every test iteration
[10:02:40] <arschmitz> zachleat: wouldent that change make it faster not slower though?
[10:02:44] <zachleat> Doesn't explain why yours is faster though, yeah
[10:03:16] <arschmitz> and its a substantial difference too!
[10:03:37] <zachleat> Did you scroll while it was running?
[10:03:53] <arschmitz> zachleat: yeah as i suspected moving the function speeds it up
[10:03:57] <arschmitz> zachleat: no
[10:05:49] <zachleat> Do you need the prepend calls there? I think there are some weird side effects with the test runner happening
[10:07:20] <arschmitz> zachleat: yeah more or less i do we started with http://jsperf.com/nativeprepend-vs-jqueryprepend suggested by some guys at samsung
[10:07:42] <arschmitz> zachleat: downside is it would add a bunch of code weight doing this each time
[10:07:52] <arschmitz> zachleat: so our solution was this makedom function
[10:08:13] <arschmitz> so i wanted to check the performance hit of wrapping this in a function like i did but it is some how ending up faster
[10:08:33] <zachleat> http://jsperf.com/makedom/2 shows native as 18% faster
[10:08:59] <zachleat> (without prepend)
[10:09:17] <arschmitz> zachleat: intresting 
[10:10:00] <zachleat> uh, wait, I fudged that test up, one sec
[10:11:38] <zachleat> fixed. makeDOM is 41% slower :-/
[10:12:23] <arschmitz> zachleat: i wonder whats up with prepend though because that is essentially part of what i was attempting to test
[10:13:06] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/9SkvXw
[10:13:06] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 149318572 15Jasper de Groot: Demos: use header in dynamic popup demo because enhancement of toolbars is a common problem with dynamically created popups.
[10:14:30] <zachleat> I'd guess that prepends take longer when your DOM is bigger
[10:14:49] <zachleat> and the tree grows when the tests run
[10:14:54] <zachleat> if you reversed the order, that'd tell you
[10:15:09] <arschmitz> ill try that
[10:15:21] <arschmitz> in firefox the speed is exactly the same for both
[10:16:17] <zachleat> you could also remove all the test elements in test setup
[10:19:34] <arschmitz> zachleat: very intresting
[10:19:53] <arschmitz> zachleat: reversing order makes native faster but...
[10:20:15] <arschmitz> zachleat: removing the test element in teardown makes makeDOM faster 
[10:21:46] <zachleat> arschmitz: hmm, interesting
[10:24:44] <zachleat> arschmitz: not sure on that last one, can you share the test code?
[10:25:01] <arschmitz> yeah just a sec was trying on some different browsers / devices
[10:26:53] <arschmitz> http://jsperf.com/makedom-reverse running a bunch of times it goes back and forth on desktop
[10:27:26] <zachleat> yeah, I made this mistake too originally
[10:27:39] <zachleat> makeDOM isn't in the global scope
[10:27:55] <zachleat> put it up in preparation code
[10:28:17] <zachleat> setup runs before every test iteration
[10:29:42] <zachleat> Benchmark.prototype.setup = function() {
[10:29:42] <zachleat>     function makeDOM(o,to){
[10:29:54] <arschmitz> i switched re running
[10:31:40] <arschmitz> zachleat: apoparently: they are damn close everytime i run it seems to be the oppisite of the run before
[10:31:49] <arschmitz> one time native next makeDOM
[10:31:54] <arschmitz> http://jsperf.com/makedom-reverse
[10:32:20] <zachleat> yeah that makes a bit more sense
[10:32:36] <arschmitz> very much so
[10:32:46] <arschmitz> i didnt understand how it could possibly be faster
[10:33:09] <zachleat> jsperf can be misleading :)
[10:33:27] <arschmitz> so apparently though there is no performance hit from the function
[10:36:17] <arschmitz> now i need to redo my original test though since it had the same prepend issue to see how that compares lol
[10:39:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so our idea of a makeDom function has essentially no impact on performance on most devices / browsers
[10:44:11] <arschmitz> zachleat: im heading out for an hour or so for lunch ill be back to merge panels once everyone decideds its ready
[10:44:48] <zachleat> okay, I noticed a few issues with the tests, hope to have them patched before then
[10:45:15] <arschmitz> zachleat: cool there is the android webview issue as well
[10:46:10] <arschmitz> zachleat: uGoMobi i think was going to look at that with you when he gets back from dinner shortly
[10:51:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wait ... what do you mean? Our function is just as slow as jQuery? Or do you mean that our function is as fast as doing createElement inline?
[11:02:34] <wilto1> friggin’ computers hi guys
[11:08:45] <wilto1> arschmitz: Testing this on my machine as we speak.
[11:14:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: as fast as inline
[11:15:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[11:15:38] <arschmitz> yup
[11:16:47] <arschmitz> I'm on my phone right now but I'll show you what I did when I got back in a bit
[11:21:36] <wilto1> arschmitz: http://jsbin.com/idugup/30
[11:22:54] <wilto1> There are like eight of me in here today.
[11:23:57] <wilto1> psst hey Wilto
[11:24:00] <wilto1> screw you, dude
[11:24:03] <wilto1> give me back my name
[11:24:09] <arschmitz> wilto1: Nice ill check it out when I get back works on iOS safari
[11:24:32] <wilto1> We got an intern running it through the device lab as we speak.
[11:25:32] <arschmitz> wilto1: Nice
[11:26:54] <arschmitz> wilto1: Did you get your wish for Tim Berners lee as winter intern lol?
[11:27:10] <wilto1> Someday.
[11:27:17] <wilto1> School credit only, though. UNPAID.
[11:28:12] <arschmitz> Ha ha unpaid interns rock
[11:31:06] <wilto1> Anyway, lemme see if I can resolve my IRC multiple personality disorder issue in the meantime.
[11:31:49] <arschmitz> wilto1: Yea zinc is supposed to fix that lol
[11:31:58] <arschmitz> Znc
[11:32:46] <wilto1> I can’t even get connected to that sucker.
[12:13:01] <zachleat>  Does anyone know why the jQM testHelper resets the QUnit fixture html?
[12:22:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsperf.com/makedom-reverse very simple version of what we talked about
[12:23:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: on chrome firefox and ie9 though it shows slower it went back and forth like every other test makeDOM faster one time then native the next
[12:27:14] <toddmparker> hey-o
[12:27:22] <toddmparker> last meeting out of the way
[12:27:38] <arschmitz> hey toddmparker
[12:27:46] <toddmparker> hey arschmitz 
[12:27:57] <toddmparker> was there an agenda for yesterday's meeting
[12:28:03] <arschmitz> no
[12:28:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i can see your meeting notes tweet now team was to lazy to taake notes all responsible have been sacked
[12:40:12] <zachleat> Okay, I've hit a brick wall on these tests, I need some consulting
[12:40:36] <arschmitz> johnbender: you around? 
[12:43:29] <Wilto_> Annnd we’re back.
[12:43:42] <Wilto_> “Forte.” That’s gotta be Andrew.
[12:45:07] <Wilto_> jQuery Mobros: Forte is interning here at FG.
[12:45:16] <arschmitz> Wilto_: when i was talking about tests earlier i wasent talking about the cssTransform3D test
[12:45:25] <Wilto_> Oh, oh. What’re you testing?
[12:45:49] <arschmitz> i was talking about our decision to adopt JSWilto for benchmark testing
[12:46:06] <Wilto_> Ah yes!
[12:46:08] <arschmitz> JSWilto = Wilto with old school mechanical stop watch
[12:46:14] <Wilto_> RESULTS: “pretty okay.”
[12:46:25] <Wilto_> “Fast but not like crazy fast or anything.”
[12:47:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5409#issuecomment-11899013
[12:47:00] <arschmitz> we made a change this moring to improve speed in the library and uGoMobi and i thought it really "seemed" faster lol
[12:47:34] <Wilto_> is that science tho
[12:48:00] <arschmitz> no thats why we need you the offical benmarker lol
[12:48:23] <Wilto_> So true.
[12:52:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5409: While the event handling may be faulty, if we were to use :focus it might still be correct, because the native logic may or may not be faulty.
[12:52:09] <bot-t> (21 hours 2 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ in opera it looks like no popstate fires when the replacestate is to the same url
[12:52:10] <bot-t> (21 hours 1 min ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ I need to figure out why it's replacing the same url but if for whatever reason that's sane, I've got a fix
[12:52:39] <_|Nix|_> Wow, bot-t! You don't say? Really? Welcome back (finally) :-S
[12:52:47] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:55:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what do you mean by "it might still be correct"?
[12:56:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just because it doesn't fire focusout, it might still remove the :focus pseudoclass, resulting in correct behaviour.
[12:56:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I tested on Opera with :focus and the problem was still there
[12:57:45] <uGoMobi> Opera is easier to test because there the issue is always visible
[12:58:23] <uGoMobi> on FF it seems to depend on certain things but I don't know what yet
[13:03:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. So much for my theory.
[13:03:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Weird that this appeared out of nowhere.
[13:03:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wonder what a git bisect would say.
[13:03:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Also, how come it's not happening with the old docs?
[13:04:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I dunno yet
[13:04:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: have to do further investigation
[13:07:06] <toddmparker> zachleat: you still need help on tests?
[13:07:38] <zachleat> yeah, these questions are getting architectural
[13:07:47] * uGoMobi is looking at panel Android WebView issue now
[13:08:34] <zachleat> toddmparker: ^
[13:11:59] <uGoMobi> scottjehl______: are you around?
[13:13:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: reverting the changes in this commit should fix the Android WebView problem https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/fca67d7f498df2597bcce50c3993ef5fa532eadc
[13:15:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I don't know the motivation of scottjehl______ to use fixed positioning, so I don't know what problems might come back when we revert this
[13:20:54] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great
[13:20:59] <toddmparker> getting scott for ya
[13:21:38] <toddmparker> we use fixed on the panel so the content appears even if scroll down
[13:22:03] <uGoMobi> ah ok, makes sense
[13:22:42] <uGoMobi> so if we revert this we have to look in alternative way to do that
[13:23:27] <uGoMobi> but might be nicer if we find something that makes the panels show up in WebView with position fixed
[13:41:30] <scottjehl______> hey there
[13:41:33] <scottjehl______> sorry
[13:42:13] <scottjehl______> so uGoMobi what is it that's conflicting with Android in that commit?
[13:42:17] <toddmparker> so if the issue is fixed only in web views, why don't we expose the fixed position as an option or class and just expelling to people to not use that feature in android web views
[13:42:28] <uGoMobi> hey scottjehl______ 
[13:42:48] <uGoMobi> scottjehl______: Android WebView seems not to support position fixed
[13:43:12] <scottjehl______> I like Todd's idea
[13:43:14] <scottjehl______> doable?
[13:43:50] <johnbender> arschmitz: what's up?
[13:44:10] <johnbender> zachleat: still stuck?
[13:44:25] <arschmitz> johnbender: zachleat was looking for help on tests thought you would be the person for that
[13:44:34] <uGoMobi> scottjehl______: toddmparker : sounds good
[13:44:53] <scottjehl______> ok!
[13:44:56] <toddmparker> so option or just a class?
[13:45:03] <zachleat> Yeah, I'm having trouble with the fixture html containing initialized html
[13:45:24] <johnbender> zachleat: resetting it can be a nightmare
[13:45:29] <johnbender> because you have to re-enhance
[13:45:41] <johnbender> I would just use a different page/widget for each test
[13:45:43] <johnbender> if that's possible
[13:45:50] <johnbender> it's what we do for the other test suites
[13:46:01] <zachleat> oh, I see.
[13:46:03] <johnbender> the DOM is rarely the issue when it comes to state management in our tests
[13:46:13] <toddmparker> ok, i think an option is better
[13:46:27] <uGoMobi> scottjehl______: yes seems doable... I think we just have to check if  that new option is set to true in this function _positionPanel
[13:46:39] <toddmparker> and we can just add a note in the docs saying "if you're building an android app, we recommend shutting fixed off"
[13:46:46] <toddmparker> great
[13:46:56] <zachleat> okay, I'll go that route.
[13:47:12] <toddmparker> thanks johnbender 
[13:47:24] <johnbender> zachleat: let me know if you run into trouble
[13:47:34] <johnbender> zachleat: the easiest thing to do is just cram all the fixtures on to one jqmpage
[13:47:44] <johnbender> then you don't have to worry about navigation state
[13:48:21] <zachleat> yeah, that part makes sense. I just wondered if, from a higher level, if it was better long term to init manually in setup for each test\
[13:49:12] <zachleat> The testing boilerplate just seems confusing for a beginner like myself :)

[14:15:54] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: there is a problem with fixed headers disappearing on Android WebView... will give that a look this weekend
[14:16:10] <uGoMobi> I am going to call it a day... good weekend all!
[14:19:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: L8R
[14:20:36] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: have a great weekend
[14:21:27] <gseguin> later uGoMobi 
[14:40:33] <Wilto_> Right okay so.
[14:40:41] <Wilto_> http://wil.to/4x
[14:40:56] <Wilto_> That points to the page transitions… page, on the new 3d support test branch.
[14:41:26] <Wilto_> So hit “flip” or the like on various test devices, and let me know if anything should burst into flames.
[14:43:15] <Wilto_> Forte, arschmitz, whomever is still around ^
[14:43:32] <arschmitz> Wilto_: will do
[14:43:48] <Wilto_> Wat’chu got for devices over there?
[14:43:55] <Forte> Yeah, i'll run some tests
[14:44:16] <arschmitz> ie7,8,9 chrome 24 firefox 17 android 2.3.7 ios5 ios6
[14:44:23] <arschmitz> and safari 
[14:44:30] <Wilto_> WebKit relies on the MQ test because Android is fuc^H^H^H challenging to work with at times.
[14:45:18] <arschmitz> ok
[14:45:41] <_|Nix|_> Wilto_: You seem to know an awful lot about terminal emulator control codes ...
[14:45:44] <Wilto_> It actually returns a proper transform matrix when a 3d transform is applied.
[14:45:54] <Wilto_> 2.3 100% understands 3d transforms.
[14:46:00] <Wilto_> Just doesn’t do anything with them.
[14:46:14] <Wilto_> _|Nix|_: Any opportunity for creative cursing, really.
[14:47:02] <_|Nix|_> Wilto_: It sorta runs counter in my mind to your efforts of yesterday wrt. terminal emulation on OSX :)
[14:47:19] <Wilto_> Oh, I’m still struggling.
[14:47:30] <Wilto_> Speaking of: brb; restarting.
[14:47:31] <_|Nix|_> Wilto_: Have you tried X11 + xterm?
[14:50:47] <arschmitz> Wilto_: all check out here
[14:50:49] <Wilto_> Naw.
[14:52:29] <Forte> WebOS and BB6 are fine
[14:53:33] <arschmitz> Wilto_: checked everything i said plus chrome on ios5 and ios6
[14:54:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsperf.com/makedom-reverse
[14:55:09] <arschmitz> Wilto_: looks like you have a winner!
[14:56:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I just don't get how the function could ever win out over native.
[14:56:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: neither do i!!!
[14:56:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But that's nice. Very modest losses.
[14:56:59] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: those are inconsistant they win sometimes too lol
[14:57:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: on chrome / firefox / ie9
[14:57:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't think the functoin should include the prependTo step.
[14:57:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... just the DOM element creation.
[14:57:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It should return the outermost DOM element.
[14:58:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What you do with it (whether it's prependTo or append or insert or whatever) is up to you.
[14:58:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it was just a test
[14:58:17] <arschmitz> i wouldnt use that exact function
[14:58:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right. NP.
[14:58:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This is great ...
[14:58:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah for sure
[14:59:05] <arschmitz> much faster then using $("<a />") 
[14:59:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I can already see a place in the demos where we can use it: $( "<div class='jqm-demo-link'><a href='./' data-rel='popup' data-role='button' data-icon='arrow-u' data-mini='true' data-inline='true' data-shadow='false'>View Source</a></div>" )
[14:59:14] <arschmitz> and will keep code weight down
[15:00:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: will have to make it more robust to handle data attributes and nested elements
[15:00:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[15:00:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The element's tagName might even be the key instead of element: "a"
[15:00:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: will want to be carefull that anything we add dosent slow it down too much though
[15:01:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It'd be closer to markup.
[15:01:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Agreed.
[15:01:18] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i did that to stick to one loop instead of two
[15:01:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: keep the inital test as lean as possible
[15:02:16] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The truth is that we might be able to keep it fast with jquery too, as long as we don't pass in large snippets of HTML.
[15:02:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i tried this vs the exact same element with $(blah).prependTo
[15:02:59] <arschmitz> its much much faster then jquery
[15:03:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: http://jsperf.com/jqueryprepend-vs-native
[15:04:37] <_|Nix|_> Like $( document.createElement( "a" ) ).attr( { attr1: value1, attr2: value2 } );
[15:04:49] <arschmitz> ok i see
[15:05:08] <arschmitz> did try anything like that
[15:05:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looking at plain clean HTML, even in quotes in a string is nice, but if it breaks perf, it has to go.
[15:05:24] <arschmitz> ill have to write a test that way
[15:05:53] <arschmitz> best to run a lot of different tests to see whats going to make most sense before making any moves
[15:06:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I wonder if we can make use of jQuery's chaining features to create arbitrary chunks of DOM.
[15:06:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then we'd basically be pre-computing the parsing step.
[15:06:55] <arschmitz> good question never tried 
[15:07:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We might end up with some nasty stuff like outer.append( inner.append( inner2.append( inner3 ) ) )
[15:08:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ugly but yet
[15:08:10] <arschmitz> yea*
[15:08:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The JSON approach might be cleaner.
[15:08:46] <arschmitz> yeah its at least easy to look at lol
[15:08:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and faster too, because you're still instantiating as many jQuery objects as you have new elements.
[15:09:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Whereas with the JSON approach, you're not instantiating any jQuery objects.
[15:09:12] <arschmitz> oh yeah and thats going to slow stuff down calls $() are not super fast lol
[15:09:21] <_|Nix|_> Exactly.
[15:09:42] <_|Nix|_> So yeah ... makeDOM (or whatever we end up calling it).
[15:10:05] <_|Nix|_> I wonder if there are any JSON-to-DOM converters out there already.
[15:11:59] <_|Nix|_> I'm going to convert the above-mentioned snippet to native and see what perf gain I get.
[15:12:41] <_|Nix|_> By making the popup super lazy I was able to get almost down to the same load time as when I comment out the generation of "view source" buttons altogether.
[15:12:46] <_|Nix|_> /Almost/
[15:13:08] <_|Nix|_> Lessee if I can shave some more off that by converting to native DOM element generation.
[15:13:09] <zachleat> okay, finally the panel tests are ready.
[15:14:09] <arschmitz> zachleat: awesome so is everything realy to merge then?
[15:15:22] <zachleat> yeah, I think ugomobi has the android thing still, but that PR is ready
[15:19:05] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gseguin opened pull request #5419: Fix for issue 5198 (06master...06issue-5198)  02http://git.io/nvnQ1w
[15:20:05] <arschmitz> zachleat: awesome im heading home but ill merge after dinner
[15:20:16] <zachleat> sweet, thanks man
[15:20:36] <arschmitz> zachleat: uGoMobi: already pushed that fix too so its all good
[15:20:51] <zachleat> doubly sweet
[15:20:58] <toddmparker> schweet
[15:21:16] <toddmparker> yeah, we can always debug android web views post-merge
[15:21:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah and for now the option takes care of it
[15:21:51] <toddmparker> the decision there is to surface an option and tell androiders to shut off fixed positioning. case cloased.
[15:21:57] <toddmparker> right-o
[15:22:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah uGoMobi already pushed that option 
[15:23:28] <arschmitz> toddmparker: so im heading home to get some dinner and then im going to merge that ( need to resolve a few conflicts but simple stuff )
[15:24:10] <Wilto_> arschmitz: Nice.
[15:24:56] <arschmitz> Wilto_: very much so iv been using my own merged version locally for a project for a few weeks lol i needed both rangeslider and panels in same project ha ha 
[15:25:11] <arschmitz> Wilto_: now i can finally just switch to master!
[15:25:44] <arschmitz> (its pre-production of course)
[15:26:04] <Wilto_> I’m willing to move my 3d thing branch to master whenever, too. I’m feelin’ good about it.
[15:26:12] <Wilto_> If anything’s busted, we’ll find out sooner rather than later.
[15:26:24] <arschmitz> Wilto: you should merge it
[15:26:34] <arschmitz> panels are broken in ie8 untill you do
[15:27:09] <arschmitz> Wilto_: we tested pretty good with no hickups i think your good

[19:30:06] <arschmitz> johnbender: not sure if you happen to be around but these tests are passing when i run local ^^
[19:52:23] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: you here?
[19:52:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker: sure am
[19:53:02] <toddmparker_> hey, i was just looking at /test/
[19:53:17] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/panels/index.html
[19:53:33] <toddmparker_> and it looks like the wrong branch was merged in
[19:53:55] <toddmparker_> this is the right branch: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel-refactor/docs/panels/index.html
[19:54:19] <toddmparker_> i think slide-panel, not slide-panel-refactor made it in
[19:54:49] <toddmparker_> not surprising there was confusing with 3 different panel branches :/
[19:55:35] <arschmitz> toddmparker: if you look at the commits its slide-panel-refactor 
[19:56:09] <arschmitz> but something is strange there
[19:57:07] <toddmparker_> huh
[19:57:28] <toddmparker_> something not right...maybe just the index page?
[19:57:39] <toddmparker_> that is definitely not right
[19:57:52] <arschmitz> yeah something ir up for sure
[19:58:11] <toddmparker_> excited to see this land though...I appreciate the help
[19:59:04] <arschmitz> no problem something is really weird though
[19:59:15] <arschmitz> i just looked at my localcopy that i pushed and its right
[19:59:39] <arschmitz> but when i look at jquerymobile.com/test it isnt
[19:59:46] <toddmparker_> maybe /test/ is wacko? lemme pull
[20:00:04] <arschmitz> yeah try pulling because local here is correct
[20:01:03] <toddmparker_> whew. it's ok locally.
[20:01:21] <toddmparker_> so what the *%$@* is up with /test/
[20:01:24] <arschmitz> weird i wonder whats up with test
[20:01:46] <arschmitz> there was a test timeout on panels when it built
[20:01:55] <arschmitz> but i cant reproduce that localy either
[20:02:00] <toddmparker_> seems impossible. being stale is one thing, but showing something from another branch is wacko
[20:02:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah for sure
[20:02:36] <arschmitz> thats really odd
[20:03:17] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: im actually working on some more changes to panel right now it use on and unbind a lot
[20:03:25] <arschmitz> switching to _on and _off
[20:03:29] <toddmparker_> ah, cool
[20:03:39] <arschmitz> that will also make your destroy a lot shorter
[20:03:42] <toddmparker_> are you at a place where you could commit something small?
[20:03:49] <arschmitz> yeah
[20:03:57] <toddmparker_> curious to see if that would cause a refresh
[20:04:10] <arschmitz> sure let me just make a small change and push
[20:04:31] <toddmparker_> nice
[20:07:02] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15arschmitz pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/dYOYag

[20:07:08] <arschmitz> ok lets see lol
[20:08:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: the last test timeout took 12 minutes
[20:08:35] <toddmparker_> woah
[20:09:09] <arschmitz> its running now im watching it
[20:13:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: panel tests timed out again
[20:14:04] <johnbender> arschmitz: :(
[20:14:05] <arschmitz> they run fine local though
[20:14:15] <johnbender> arschmitz: we can deal with it on monday
[20:14:16] <arschmitz> so im really not sure what the issue is
[20:14:37] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah im hoping /test/ will still update though lol
[20:17:20] <toddmparker_> no dice
[20:17:30] <arschmitz> its still running
[20:17:34] <toddmparker_> johnbender: any idea why test doesn't match local?
[20:17:38] <toddmparker_> oh, i see
[20:18:01] <toddmparker_> once tests finish, /test/ is updated
[20:19:14] <arschmitz> i think its almost done though
[20:19:25] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1021: STILL FAILING in 12 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1021/
[20:19:46] <arschmitz> and there it is
[20:20:06] <arschmitz> no dice still though
[20:20:17] <arschmitz> soo weird
[20:20:33] <arschmitz> i dont get how it would show a whole different branch
[20:20:52] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker_: now I'm confused
[20:20:56] <johnbender> what's happening?
[20:21:34] <arschmitz> hi johnbender: a page on /test/ is completely different then the same page if you pull and view local
[20:21:55] <arschmitz> like a page in the docs
[20:22:40] <arschmitz> and the page thats showing on /test/ is from a different branch all together
[20:22:50] <johnbender> arschmitz: which page/
[20:22:51] <johnbender> ?
[20:23:12] <arschmitz> johnbender: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/panels/index.html
[20:23:55] <arschmitz> should be the same as http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel-refactor/docs/panels/index.html
[20:24:14] <arschmitz> but is showing http://jquerymobile.com/branches/panel/docs/panels/index.html
[20:24:37] <johnbender> arschmitz: and you're looking at master locally?
[20:24:46] <arschmitz> johnbender: yes
[20:24:52] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker_: _|Nix|_ was monkeying with deploy_latest today
[20:24:54] <arschmitz> toddmparker_ tried it too
[20:25:16] <johnbender> arschmitz: do a `git log -p Makefile` and `git log -p build/`
[20:25:21] <arschmitz> johnbender: im also the one that just pushed that page and checked my local i pushed and its correct
[20:27:16] <arschmitz> johnbender: i dont have grunt on this laptop right now
[20:27:32] <johnbender> arschmitz: that's fine, were there changes recently?
[20:27:37] <arschmitz> yes
[20:27:41] <arschmitz> within the last hour
[20:27:48] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's likely that those are causing the problem
[20:27:50] <johnbender> :)
[20:27:51] <arschmitz> but the page didnt previously exist at all
[20:28:09] <arschmitz> so i dont know how it would get a copy from a different branch
[20:28:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: neither do I, I'd have to look into it
[20:28:34] <arschmitz> its super strange
[20:28:41] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker_: is this something I should look into tonight? My wife and I were about to sit down and watch Homeland
[20:28:54] <arschmitz> there is a test timeout too not sure if it could be related
[20:29:11] <arschmitz> johnbender: i cant speak for toddmparker_ but i think it can wait till tomorrow
[20:29:42] <arschmitz> its just a docs page for panels
[20:30:00] <toddmparker_> no, this can wait
[20:30:02] <toddmparker_> no worries!
[20:30:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: arschmitz: she's taking care of some stuff let me see if it's something obvious
[20:31:14] <toddmparker_> homeland is so damn good
[20:31:24] <arschmitz> iv never actually watched it
[20:31:28] <toddmparker_> he's a spy!
[20:31:34] <toddmparker_> no, he's a patriot!
[20:31:45] <toddmparker_> oops, spoiler alert
[20:31:51] <arschmitz> ha ha 
[20:31:57] <arschmitz> i actually knew that much
[20:35:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: johnbender: i think github is down
[20:35:23] <arschmitz> nevermind working now
[20:35:24] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[20:35:52] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile
[20:35:56] <toddmparker_> ^ works for me
[20:36:23] <arschmitz> yeah it started working again just a hicup
[20:38:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker_: yah it doesn't look like any of the build changes would have affected /test/
[20:41:04] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok i really am at a loss as to what going on or where that page is coming from
[20:41:14] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah I'm monkeying around on the server

[20:46:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: thats not the page from slide_panel
[20:47:10] <toddmparker_> no? 
[20:47:11] <arschmitz> thats the right page but one of the panels isnt being enhanced
[20:47:28] <arschmitz> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel/docs/panels/index.html
[20:47:33] <arschmitz> totally differnet
[20:47:34] <toddmparker_> oooooh
[20:47:38] <toddmparker_> you're right
[20:47:50] <toddmparker_> i see my edits there
[20:47:59] <arschmitz> so its something with the combine i think
[20:48:24] <toddmparker_> The panel markup is before the header, content and footer in the source order.
[20:48:38] <toddmparker_> ^^ all other panels are after the page in the source order
[20:48:48] <toddmparker_> so i think it's freaking out on that
[20:48:59] <toddmparker_> it should support either order
[20:49:04] <toddmparker_> it did
[20:49:04] <arschmitz> yeah for some reason that works with the combine.php version
[20:49:13] <toddmparker_> but i bet that's the culprit
[20:49:16] <arschmitz> but not with jquery.mobile.js
[20:49:33] <toddmparker_> so maybe it's an order issue with the scripts?
[20:49:33] <arschmitz> thats the difference between test and branches
[20:49:43] <arschmitz> something 
[20:50:17] <arschmitz> im going to be working all day tomorrow so ill see if i can figure it out
[20:50:36] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.js
[20:50:43] <toddmparker_> ^^ panel js isn't there at all
[20:50:53] <toddmparker_> that's the issue
[20:51:16] <arschmitz> a ha
[20:51:18] <toddmparker_> the other panels aren't enhanced either, they are just at the bottom
[20:51:36] <toddmparker_> step 1 - check to see if the JS is there
[20:51:37] <arschmitz> i bet it didnt get added to the list of files to include
[20:51:42] <toddmparker_> steps 2 - debug the JS
[20:51:46] <toddmparker_> yeppers
[20:52:01] <toddmparker_> what file is that?
[20:52:36] <arschmitz> jquery.mobile.js
[20:52:39] <arschmitz> its missing there
[20:52:47] <arschmitz> i can fix that
[20:53:07] <johnbender> toddmparker_: arschmitz: I'll take a look later
[20:53:17] <arschmitz> johnbender allready got it
[20:53:23] <johnbender> arschmitz: ... ?
[20:53:26] <toddmparker_> easy fix
[20:53:26] <johnbender> what was it?
[20:53:28] <arschmitz> they just forgot to add it to jquery.mobile.js
[20:53:42] <toddmparker_> the panel.js isn't in http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.js
[20:53:43] <arschmitz> so the js is missing
[20:53:44] <johnbender> arschmitz: I meant the issue with the out of date page
[20:53:44] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1022: STILL FAILING in 12 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1022/
[20:53:55] <johnbender> arschmitz: okeedokee
[20:53:58] <johnbender> that was easy :
[20:53:58] <arschmitz> yeah its not out of date
[20:54:00] <toddmparker_> johnbender: turns out it's not out of date
[20:54:00] <johnbender> :)
[20:54:12] <arschmitz> im pushing the fix now
[20:54:12] <toddmparker_> it kinda looked like an older version of the docs page
[20:54:26] <toddmparker_> but it's actually just un-enhanced panels
[20:55:19] <toddmparker_> nice going to bed with this looking good

[21:10:58] <toddmparker_> remind me, we need to look at the css change we did to remove overflow-x on panels when open. think that broke the swipe to close. maybe uGoMobi_ will have ideas on that. think it was causing firefox issues?
