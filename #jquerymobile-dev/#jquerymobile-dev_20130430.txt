[08:40:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: arschmitz did you guys see the email from jorn?
[08:40:28] <johnbender> arschmitz: nevermind I see you responded
[08:40:47] <arschmitz> johnbender: yup 
[08:41:00] <johnbender> arschmitz: thanks
[08:41:24] <arschmitz> of course i had seen it this morning and ment to but got distracted but then when i saw yours it reminded me 
[08:42:37] <arschmitz> johnbender: unfourtanitly its not going to be much help to him right this moment though :(
[08:43:03] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah
[08:43:10] <johnbender> arschmitz: we're just starting the process
[08:43:17] <arschmitz> yup
[08:43:32] <johnbender> arschmitz: personally I think it's better to release frequently while we do this so people catch our bugs
[08:43:38] <arschmitz> probably have a handful of them done for 1.4 hopefully rest for 1.5
[08:44:02] <johnbender> that sounds like a totally reasonable timeline from my perspective
[08:44:10] <arschmitz> yeah and i think ones that will help performance have a bit higher priority right now too
[08:44:42] <arschmitz> like toolbars/ popups / panels all will have a direct perfromance impact by existing outside a page
[08:45:08] <arschmitz> because you wont have to pull in and enhance them on every single page if they are a global item like those things often are
[08:47:17] <arschmitz> johnbender: form widgets and listviews while it would be nice to use them outside the frame work ala ui widgets i dont think thats the immediate priority
[08:47:51] <johnbender> arschmitz: that makes sense
[08:48:21] <johnbender> yes, one of the things I've been preaching about refactoring is that we should aim for the refactoring that provides value to existing users first
[08:48:39] <arschmitz> johnbender: exactly
[08:48:43] <johnbender> get's them to upgrade for bug fixes too
[08:48:57] <johnbender> then we can go about refactoring as a feature
[08:49:06] <arschmitz> yup
[08:49:30] <johnbender> that also forces us to think about backward compat for the sake of getting people to upgrade
[08:49:34] <johnbender> which is always a good thing
[08:50:05] <arschmitz> yup backcompat is really important to push upgrade users
[08:50:09] <johnbender> that is, we should alwyas be backward compatable for minor versions but it requires more thought when you're simply improving existing features
[08:51:11] <arschmitz> i think our inital goals for 1.4 were a bit lofty
[08:51:16] <ajpiano> what's the right place to report view.jquerymobile.com ?
[08:51:17] <ajpiano> issues
[08:51:30] <arschmitz> johnbender: but i think we are much more focused now
[08:51:33] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#339 (master - 6ef1b85 : Gabriel Schulhof): The build is still failing.

[08:51:33] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/6760568
[08:51:58] <johnbender> ajpiano: that's a good question
[08:52:04] <arschmitz> ajpiano: thats a great question! im not sure but i would just put them on the jquery-mobile repo
[08:52:10] <johnbender> ajpiano: are we still having problems with 1.3.1 ?
[08:52:26] <arschmitz> they are most likely to get seen and addressed quickly there 
[08:52:41] <arschmitz> and they dont really have their own place to report them
[08:53:31] <ajpiano> ok, i'll have him report it there
[08:53:46] <ajpiano> someone reported that http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/dist/demos/examples/swipe/newyork.html is weird
[08:54:05] <arschmitz> oh yeah there is an issue for that allready i belive
[08:54:59] <ajpiano> oh
[08:55:07] <arschmitz> im trying to find it right now
[09:00:46] <arschmitz> ajpiano: hmm i cant find it maybe its just something we knew about and noticed but didnt file issue for.
[09:02:28] <arschmitz> ajpiano: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5877
[09:02:36] <arschmitz> and then i found it lol
[09:02:58] <ajpiano> arschmitz: those are the same issue??
[09:03:44] <arschmitz> yes the problem with that page is that it uses prefetch to make the transition smooth
[09:04:37] <arschmitz> you will see the same error mentioned in the issue occurs on the page you posted. loadpage is used internally in this case
[09:05:07] <arschmitz> ajapiao: would be good to have him comment that hes seeing it there also though just so its documented
[09:25:53] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: toddmparker: gseguin: agcolom: http://johnbender.us/2013/04/30/reasoning-about-the-heap-in-rust

[09:26:13] <toddmparker> will try to check in if i get a sec
[09:26:25] <johnbender> and your upvotes on HN are always apprecaited: https://news.ycombinator.com/newest
[09:26:30] <johnbender> a little ways down now
[09:26:50] <arschmitz> johnbender: reading it right now
[09:40:41] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15mpereira opened issue #5951: Swipe demo page for jQuery Mobile 1.3.1 is broken  02http://git.io/9PFtLg
[10:03:06] <arschmitz> johnbender: really nice well done
[10:03:33] <arschmitz> johnbender: not so math heavy as your last few posts
[10:04:08] <arschmitz> and explained really well so the average programmer could easilly understand it. 
[10:12:01] <johnbender> arschmitz: thanks!
[10:12:46] <arschmitz> johnbender: No problem id actually been reading recently some about memory allocation and managment so it was intresting
[10:13:01] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah it was a good refresher for me
[10:13:07] <johnbender> I've been using managed languages for so long
[10:13:15] <arschmitz> yup same here
[10:13:36] <arschmitz> not something you think about much outside of varible scoping and performance stuff
[10:13:56] <arschmitz> and only in really really large stuff does that even become an issue generally
[10:14:51] <arschmitz> had not really looked at rust much yet but probabbly should at some point lol
[10:16:29] <arschmitz> johnbender: but yeah i thought it was really well written in a very easy to understand way. I enjoyed it a lot
[10:36:13] <gseguin> johnbender: will look at it
[10:36:21] <gseguin> johnbender: why this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.3-stable/js/navigation/path.js#L186 ?
[11:09:43] <johnbender> gseguin: it looks like the point was to remove anything tacked on after the hash key
[11:09:56] <johnbender> eg params
[11:29:25] <gseguin> johnbender: that is a breaking change ( at least for our app )
[11:29:41] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[11:29:51] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm pretty sure it's there to fix a bug
[11:29:55] <johnbender> but I don't recall which
[11:29:59] <gseguin> johnbender: and I would guess we're not the only ones
[11:30:05] <johnbender> gseguin: it's pretty trivial to override that function
[11:30:11] <johnbender> gseguin: was it added since release?
[11:30:16] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm thinking that's pretty old
[11:30:28] <gseguin> it wasn't like that in 1.2
[11:31:02] <gseguin> yeah overriding that method is a fix
[11:31:19] <gseguin> just wanted to make sure it's a wanted change
[11:31:37] <johnbender> gseguin: well now I'm not sure
[11:31:42] <johnbender> did I add it for 1.3?
[11:31:48] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm guessing I did
[11:31:51] <gseguin> it looks like it
[11:32:04] <johnbender> gseguin: what does the commit say?
[11:32:18] <johnbender> gseguin: or at least what's the commit hash
[11:32:28] <gseguin> johnbender: let me find out
[11:33:02] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[11:33:08] <johnbender> gseguin: it's just because I split the path out
[11:33:13] <johnbender> gseguin: for the nav module
[11:33:29] <gseguin> yeah there is no specific hash
[11:33:31] <johnbender> gseguin: not because I changed it
[11:33:56] <johnbender> gseguin: greping for that through the logs of jquery.mobile.navigation is going to be a bitch
[11:33:59] <johnbender> let me look
[11:34:43] <gseguin> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/1.2-stable/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L192
[11:35:14] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I believe you, just need to find the commit so we can figure out why
[11:36:13] <johnbender> gseguin: found it one sec
[11:37:09] <johnbender> gseguin: issue #5085
[11:37:24] <johnbender> gseguin: first pass at supporting query params in hash tags (no surprise)
[11:37:38] <gseguin> ha
[11:38:00] <johnbender> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/824261bd9d12012ef48effb7f3dbaa65eb559ac3
[11:38:51] <johnbender> gseguin: looks like there are some other issues associated
[11:38:57] <johnbender> so we might well have broken some other folks apps
[11:39:29] <gseguin> thanks for looking
[11:39:47] <gseguin> I'll see what I can come up with to fix my code then
[11:53:01] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Congrats on your new King!
[12:33:29] <gseguin> johnbender: so the problem is that we lose the target info when calling changePage
[12:33:52] <gseguin> johnbender: because the target is added to settings which is a clone of options
[12:34:34] <gseguin> johnbender: I think it should be added to options before cloning, thoughts?
[12:35:19] <johnbender> gseguin: looking
[12:36:37] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm not clear on what you're saying
[12:36:44] <gseguin> though it is stored in the page's data( "absUrl" ) but I still think it should be in the options sent to the changePage here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js#L762
[12:36:50] <johnbender> gseguin: the $.extend is cloberring something?
[12:37:10] <gseguin> the setting of .target happens line 752
[12:37:25] <gseguin> the options settings has already been cloned
[12:37:47] <johnbender> gseguin: so  you want to use settings in the done callback?
[12:37:50] <gseguin> so the second call to changePage does not receive the target attribute in the options object
[12:38:19] <gseguin> johnbender: that or add the .target before cloning
[12:38:23] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm it must be getting removed somehwere in loadPage
[12:38:38] <johnbender> since settings is passed in to loadPage
[12:39:09] <gseguin> oh
[12:39:14] * gseguin looks
[12:39:29] <johnbender> gseguin: let me know what you find, I'm in the middle of refactoring all of that so a change is going to make my life difficult
[12:39:49] <gseguin> k
[12:42:49] <gseguin> johnbender: it doesn't get lost
[12:42:59] <gseguin> I must be the one doing something wrong
[12:49:33] <gseguin> johnbender: one more question
[12:49:55] <johnbender> gseguin: shoot
[12:50:14] <gseguin> can I still maintain state in the url with that querystring stripping?
[12:50:35] <gseguin> it seems like I'm missing something
[12:50:52] <johnbender> gseguin: let me look, I need to refersh my memory on this crap
[12:51:30] <gseguin> sorry to bug you, I'm attempting an upgrade to 1.3.1 and that seems to be the blocking issue
[12:51:39] <johnbender> gseguin: you have access to it in all the page life cycle events
[12:51:41] <johnbender> gseguin: not at all
[12:51:53] <gseguin> but it's not in the url though
[12:51:57] <johnbender> correct
[12:52:03] <gseguin> so if I hit refresh, I lose my state
[12:52:03] <johnbender> one sec
[12:53:19] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm according to the commit message the goal is purely for internal pages
[12:53:50] <gseguin> johnbender: what do you mean?
[12:54:02] <johnbender> gseguin: well people wanted to use query params for internal pages
[12:54:07] <johnbender> gseguin: I assume that's what you're doing
[12:54:11] <gseguin> yup
[12:54:28] <gseguin> but I want to keep the state in the url
[12:55:08] <gseguin> cause I want to be able to do things like #content?id=1 -> #content?id=2 and hit back
[12:55:18] <johnbender> hmm
[12:55:26] <johnbender> I'm trying to recall what the thinking was here
[12:55:27] <gseguin> does it make sense?
[12:55:29] <johnbender> and I'm struggling
[12:55:30] <johnbender> totally
[12:55:36] <johnbender> though we don't support it obviuosly
[12:55:41] <johnbender> (obviously)
[12:56:00] <agcolom> johnbender: gseguin sorry to interrupt... I just have a v quick question: someone put up a test case using <link rel="stylesheet"  href="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/git/jquery.mobile-git.css" />  is this ok?
[12:56:13] <gseguin> I had some code that was intercepting  pagebeforechange that was doing that 
[12:56:21] <gseguin> but it's broken with 1.3
[12:56:30] <agcolom> and <script src="http://code.jquery.com/mobile/git/jquery.mobile-git.js"></script> 
[12:56:41] <gseguin> agcolom: yep that's the new url
[12:56:55] <agcolom> gseguin: ok, great! Thanks!
[12:57:19] <gseguin> agcolom: following core's naming convention
[12:57:33] <agcolom> oh ok! 
[12:57:47] <agcolom> There's so much going on! I can't keep track!
[12:58:14] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm, I don't think the intention was to change what was actually in the url
[12:58:17] <johnbender> only how we were referencing it
[12:58:18] <gseguin> same here obviously ;)
[12:58:39] <johnbender> that is we can't use something with query params as a selector etc
[12:58:51] <johnbender> we need the thing without params to reference the page
[12:58:58] <johnbender> but people need it in the events
[12:59:01] <gseguin> johnbender: so the problem is if I do changePage( "#content?id=1" )
[12:59:06] <johnbender> ah
[12:59:15] <gseguin> all that ends up in the address bar is #content
[12:59:22] <johnbender> hmm
[12:59:30] <gseguin> or so it seems
[12:59:46] <johnbender> gseguin: when we assign the hash we should use the "old version" then
[13:00:08] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't recall considering the other direction at the time :(
[13:00:42] <johnbender> gseguin: are you using options with the changePage call?
[13:01:00] <johnbender> $.mobile.navigate is one way around that
[13:01:11] <johnbender> (if you're not using options)
[13:01:26] <johnbender> we need to extend navigate to pass the options through
[13:01:31] <johnbender> it's on the todo list
[13:01:33] <gseguin> no
[13:01:40] <gseguin> I'm not using options
[13:01:46] <gseguin> or I should say not everytime
[13:02:24] <johnbender> gseguin: in the future I envision $.mobile.navigate replaceing changePage
[13:02:28] <gseguin> I just tried opening http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.1/demos/widgets/pages/multipage-template.html
[13:02:43] <gseguin> then call changePage( "#two?id=1" )
[13:02:57] <gseguin> we lose the querystring
[13:03:00] <johnbender> ya
[13:03:04] <johnbender> that makes sense to me
[13:03:06] <gseguin> boo :(
[13:03:14] <johnbender> not that it's a good thing
[13:03:23] <johnbender> but it makes sense for how I was thinking about the problem at the time
[13:03:52] <johnbender> gseguin: navigate works in that instance
[13:04:07] <johnbender> $.mobile.navigate( "#two?id=1" )
[13:04:11] <gseguin> hmm... 
[13:04:23] <gseguin> oh!
[13:04:28] <gseguin> let me try something
[13:04:44] <johnbender> gseguin: using navigate in these scenarios makes a lot more sense to me
[13:04:51] <gseguin> agreed
[13:04:55] <johnbender> we've built the whole framework to respond properly to url alteration, we might as well use it
[13:05:08] <johnbender> gseguin: I want to move the link bindings to $.mobile.navigate
[13:05:12] <johnbender> but it needs to pass the options through
[13:06:10] <gseguin> yeah and that was the thing I was going to say
[13:06:31] <gseguin> we installed a vclick handler on most or our links
[13:07:35] <johnbender> gseguin: extending the navigator to do that should be pretty trivial if you want to do it for 1.4
[13:07:40] <johnbender> everyone would love you for it
[13:07:56] <gseguin> I'll look into it
[13:17:13] <arschmitz> agcolom: _|Nix|_: i just noticed that jqmdata is not documented at api.jquerymobile.com though im not really sure we should add it lol
[13:17:55] <johnbender> gseguin: obviously that doesn't help you much in this case :(
[13:18:08] <johnbender> gseguin: at least where options are needed
[13:27:59] <agcolom> arschmitz: I'm happy to add it but not sure it should be... 
[13:28:29] <arschmitz> agcolom: i was being somewhat sarcastic with that it should be documented it always has been
[13:28:47] <arschmitz> its just not good for perfromance we have stoped using it internally
[13:28:49] <agcolom> OMG how did I get stuck on FF 9 on my Mac book air?? (yes 9!)
[13:28:59] <arschmitz> ouch
[13:29:21] * agcolom is obviously downloading updates!!!!!
[13:29:34] <arschmitz> lol yeah im on 20 currently :)
[13:29:54] <agcolom> yes, that's what I have on my other machine and was expecting here as well ;-)
[13:30:11] <agcolom> the api docs footer was all white!
[13:30:26] <agcolom> otherwise I wouldn't have noticed!
[13:31:09] <agcolom> ok, I'm on FF 20 now! 
[13:32:07] <agcolom> arschmitz: oh ok ;-) 
[13:32:23] <agcolom> will have a look. must be one I forgot doing.... 
[13:32:37] <arschmitz> its under methods
[13:32:43] <arschmitz> in 1.2 docus
[13:39:27] <agcolom> arschmitz: I guess most (if not all) of the $.fn.x methods are missing...
[13:40:24] <agcolom> will try to get some done tomorro...
[13:40:26] <agcolom> tomorrow
[13:40:38] <arschmitz> oops... oh well i thought several of us (including myself) checked evertyhing before the switch too
[13:41:12] <agcolom> I'll have a quick look... 
[13:42:07] <agcolom> yes, only $.x methods were done
[13:43:10] <uGoMobi> hey all
[13:43:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks :)
[13:45:22] <agcolom> uGoMobi: so was it a day off today in the Netherlands?
[13:45:36] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, national holiday
[13:45:46] <agcolom> Fantastic! How about tomorrow?
[13:46:06] <agcolom> (it's a holiday in France but not in the UK :( )
[13:46:13] <uGoMobi> tomorrow everyone back to work
[13:46:15] <uGoMobi> same here
[13:46:23] <uGoMobi> only banks are closed I think
[13:46:40] <agcolom> oh shame! At least you had today which must have been nice!
[13:47:07] <uGoMobi> yeah, Queens Day is always a big party here in Amsterdam
[13:47:14] <uGoMobi> this was the last one though
[13:47:41] <uGoMobi> but we will have Kings Day from now on :)
[13:47:48] <agcolom> Ah! 
[13:47:55] <gseguin> aren't banks always closed anyways?
[13:48:38] <agcolom> uGoMobi: did you see this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5941
[13:49:16] <agcolom> gseguin: are banks closed in the US tomorrow?
[13:49:18] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw the ticket, but didn't try it on iOS yet
[13:49:28] <gseguin> I don't know 
[13:49:29] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I tried and I can confirm
[13:49:37] <gseguin> I bank online and on the phone
[13:49:46] <uGoMobi> gseguin: same here
[13:49:48] <gseguin> was tired of always finding a closed door
[13:50:11] <uGoMobi> only time I went to bank was when jQuery sent me a check for dev summit ticket lol
[13:52:09] <arschmitz> i love that my bank now has it so i can take a photo of the check with my iphone to deposit it
[13:52:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: seriously?
[13:52:46] <arschmitz> yup :)
[13:53:11] <arschmitz> so no i really never need to go to the bank 
[13:53:14] <arschmitz> now
[13:53:36] <uGoMobi> a photo of a check? and no fraud at all?
[13:54:14] <gseguin> uGoMobi: same here, cash my checks with my phone now
[13:54:22] <gseguin> been doing so for nearly a year
[13:54:32] <arschmitz> gseguin: bank of america?
[13:54:39] <gseguin> arschmitz: schwab
[13:54:44] <uGoMobi> I don't know how that check system works... we don't have them here
[13:54:51] <arschmitz> yeah im sure most of the big ones have it now
[13:55:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: they have photos of both sides that the can verify the same way
[13:55:44] <arschmitz> and they have all the routing and account numbers on the bottom 
[13:55:57] <uGoMobi> but you can change the amount
[13:55:57] <arschmitz> so its really no different 
[13:56:08] <arschmitz> you can on a paper check too
[13:56:30] <uGoMobi> yeah, that's why I don't understand why there are still checks
[13:56:49] <arschmitz> lol well thats why on a check it needs to be written out and in numbers
[13:56:55] <arschmitz> makes it hard to change the amount
[13:57:03] <uGoMobi> right
[13:57:30] <arschmitz> and check fraud is check fraud
[13:57:44] <arschmitz> if you mess with it your almost guranteed to get caught 
[13:57:47] <uGoMobi> we have only online banking here, via web and all banks have a mobile app to wire money
[13:57:53] <arschmitz> cool
[13:58:43] <uGoMobi> cool... until two weeks ago when there was a DDoS attack on all big banks
[13:58:45] <uGoMobi> lol
[13:58:55] <arschmitz> yeah i heard about that
[14:00:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: will try to debug https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5941 tomorrow
[14:00:46] <uGoMobi> I think I better go sleep now
[14:02:39] <uGoMobi> good night all
[14:04:10] <agcolom> goodnight Jasper!
[14:04:22] <gseguin> see ya uGoMobi
[14:09:37] <gseguin> johnbender: not sure exactly what you mean by extending the navigator
[14:09:52] <johnbender> gseguin: js/navigation/navigator.js
[14:10:00] <gseguin> yeah I see that file
[14:10:07] <gseguin> I was looking into it
[14:10:17] <johnbender> gseguin: the navigate method can be extended to pass the data along
[14:10:27] <gseguin> and it seems like it would mean installing a hashchange event unconditionally
[14:10:28] <johnbender> gseguin: it might require altering the navigate event but I'm not sure
[14:10:37] <johnbender> gseguin: o.O
[14:10:41] <johnbender> gseguin: not sure what you mean
[14:10:50] <johnbender> gseguin: let me  take a quick look
[14:10:53] <gseguin> in the setup method
[14:11:04] <gseguin> I might be reading the code totally wrong
[14:11:22] * gseguin is completely new to that module
[14:12:27] <johnbender> gseguin: I think the only real issue is communicating th state when a hashchange is triggered and not a popstate
[14:13:06] <johnbender> gseguin: yah that's going to require some doing
[14:13:06] <gseguin> the thing is we don't install the hashchange handler if we support popstate, right?
[14:13:15] <johnbender> gseguin: correct
[14:13:30] <johnbender> gseguin: changes to the hash still trigger popstate 
[14:13:40] <gseguin> hmm
[14:13:53] <johnbender> gseguin: don't worry about messing with the navigator
[14:13:57] <johnbender> it's more complex than I thought
[14:14:02] <gseguin> when I click on an anchor it doesn't trigger the popstate handler
[14:14:23] <johnbender> gseguin: hmmm maybe I'm crazy
[14:14:36] <gseguin> or maybe I am ;)
[14:14:37] <johnbender> gseguin: it's been a while
