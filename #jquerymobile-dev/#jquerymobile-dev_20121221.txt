[04:55:20] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[05:27:11] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:27:31] <arschmitz> so i got the problems with range fixed
[05:27:47] <arschmitz> working on using only 1 slider though think i can do it an shorten the code
[05:27:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw that, great!
[05:28:02] <arschmitz> but dont worry it wont change any of your css :)
[05:28:39] <arschmitz> hey do we in general have any issue with using * to target ie7 in css?
[05:28:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: haven't fixed that issue on Chrome yet (fieldcontain after resize <28em --> >28em)
[05:28:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes we do
[05:28:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: because it doesn't validate
[05:29:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ahh yeah 
[05:30:42] <arschmitz> if i can make it work with one slider i wont need to target ie7 at all anyway
[05:31:00] <uGoMobi> yeah that would be nice
[05:31:29] <arschmitz> currently i need to set visibility:hidden on something just in ie7
[05:32:22] <uGoMobi> would -ms-filter opacity 0 do the trick?
[05:32:32] <arschmitz> yeah i think that would be fine
[05:32:39] <arschmitz> or wait does that target ie8 too?
[05:32:54] <uGoMobi> you also have long property that is only used by IE7 i think
[05:33:08] <uGoMobi> long value I mean
[05:33:16] <uGoMobi> one sec
[05:33:16] <arschmitz> yea i think so
[05:33:34] <uGoMobi>  -ms-filter:"progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=50)";
[05:33:41] <uGoMobi> that one
[05:33:51] <arschmitz> ok
[05:34:00] <arschmitz> ill do that if i cant make it work the other way
[05:34:07] <uGoMobi> you would have to check which IE versions understand that
[05:34:45] <arschmitz> im hoping to not have to target
[05:35:00] <arschmitz> because if i can make it work how i want it will be hidden to everything
[05:37:57] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: your a genious lol
[05:38:13] <uGoMobi> thanks :)
[05:38:14] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:38:15] <arschmitz> ha ha ha
[05:38:20] <arschmitz> notice i spelled it wrong
[05:39:02] <uGoMobi> of course, I am a genius remember ;-)
[05:39:16] <arschmitz> but opacity is perfect because of a different ie bug!
[05:39:28] <uGoMobi> haha
[05:39:36] <arschmitz> ie allows you to click through anything transparent
[05:39:43] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:39:50] <arschmitz> others like chrome and firefox dont
[05:40:28] <arschmitz> so by making it opacity:0; ie clicks through to handle and works fine
[05:40:34] <uGoMobi> perfect
[05:40:42] <arschmitz> and chrome and other capture events as they should
[05:40:48] <arschmitz> everyone plays happy
[05:43:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: Re: http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/201212/ios_webkit_browsers_and_auto-zooming_form_controls/    arschmitz and I noticed the impact of font-size https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3690#issuecomment-10843666 (prevent focus zoom doesn't work with mini sized text inputs)
[05:44:36] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah we beat them by like 20 days lol
[05:45:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: apparently we need to blog ha ha 
[05:45:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah we should
[05:46:08] <uGoMobi> well we blog on the JQM issue tracker :)
[05:46:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol yeah
[05:46:35] <arschmitz> hey and the channel is publicly logged
[05:46:47] <arschmitz> its our real time rolling blug
[05:46:47] <uGoMobi> it is
[05:46:49] <arschmitz> blog
[05:47:44] <arschmitz> should make each day a post ha ha
[05:48:24] <arschmitz> i even have an api i use that could extract the main topics of the day lol
[05:49:15] <uGoMobi> seriously? nice lol
[06:12:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[06:12:59] <arschmitz> its really cool i use it for this recomendation engine thing i built
[06:27:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i tried it on yesterday it work "ok" lol but the room was really quiet yesterday https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xQw4kGUyLk1NjFs2WbAMf8WgYKHTXBmg868Zki_7J50/edit
[06:29:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool
[06:31:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i use it on news and blog articles and it works great lol
[06:32:01] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I can imagine it's more difficult on IRC with all the strange nicks, code snippets, etc.
[06:32:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for sure
[06:33:30] <uGoMobi> didn't they work on something like that during the dev summit?
[06:33:40] <arschmitz> they talked about it
[06:33:47] <arschmitz> i suggested the api i use on their issue
[06:34:08] <arschmitz> but from what gnarf said they didnt actually work on it it got pushed to the back burner
[06:34:51] <uGoMobi> oh ok, I thought there was a table where they were working on a tool like this
[06:35:11] <arschmitz> yeah the infr team had it as an issue but they didnt actually work on it
[06:35:51] <arschmitz> it wasent in the doc i sent you but it also does sentament analysis
[06:36:01] <uGoMobi> Splunk
[06:36:08] <arschmitz> so it will determin if the items are being talked about in a favorable way or not
[06:36:13] <uGoMobi> that was it... couldn't remember the name
[06:36:16] <arschmitz> it was something they wanted to work into splunk
[06:36:21] <uGoMobi> right
[06:37:13] <arschmitz> its an extreamly impressive api 
[06:37:19] <uGoMobi> powerful tools 
[06:37:25] <uGoMobi> yeah for sure
[06:38:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://www.alchemyapi.com/
[06:38:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I looked at that
[06:39:20] <uGoMobi> hard to forget because since then Google is showing me ads for it ever since
[06:39:36] <arschmitz> lol oh did you look at it when i posted on the issue?
[06:39:47] <arschmitz> and yeah they love to advertise for it
[06:39:52] <uGoMobi> err nice grammer.. but you get what i meant
[06:39:54] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:40:14] <uGoMobi> grammar even... I think I better stop typing ;-)
[06:40:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ha ha i know the feeling 
[06:40:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I don't remember what made me visit that site
[06:41:32] <uGoMobi> I really like those kind of tools though
[06:41:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool its impressive stuff though
[06:41:53] <uGoMobi> it really is
[06:48:58] <jqcommit> 01[13api.jquerymobile.com01] 15agcolom pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/3Mc_0g
[06:48:59] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 148854808 15Anne-Gaelle Colom: minor correction to example text
[07:11:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i would assume $("selector").data("mobileslider").slider would always be faster then $(selector).find('ui-slider-app:first') right?
[07:11:42] <arschmitz> because its an actual stored value and no find
[07:15:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that sounds correct but I would have to look at the code to get the complete picture
[07:15:58] <arschmitz> lol that is pretty much it sliderFirst.data("mobileSlider").slider vs this.element.find("ui-slider-app:first");
[07:16:43] <arschmitz> just two differnet ways of selecting the first slider
[07:17:41] <arschmitz> i was just looking over to see anywhere things might be able to be faster or cleaned up
[07:17:43] <uGoMobi> aha.. I was missing that sliderFirst part
[07:19:34] <uGoMobi> don't you use .find() there anyway?
[07:20:19] <arschmitz> no
[07:20:26] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:20:29] <arschmitz> oh sorry should be inputFirst not sliderFirst
[07:20:45] <uGoMobi> ah now I get it
[07:20:51] <arschmitz> i use to get input first but now i wont have to to get sliderFirst
[07:21:00] <arschmitz> just a minor performance thing
[07:21:14] <uGoMobi> all bits help
[07:21:26] <arschmitz> anywhere i can use the built in refrences on slider vs find
[07:22:03] <arschmitz> adding a few comments too so its clear why some of the things are there like in change 
[07:23:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: are we sure that slider is always initialized before rangeslider?
[07:23:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: even when people use the download builder
[07:23:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes because it a dependancy
[07:24:01] <arschmitz> so it will always be first
[07:24:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok
[07:44:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we should have an issue with html>/**/body .ui-rangeslider .ui-rangeslider-sliders .ui-slider-app:first-child right{ stuff } right it validates fine? 
[07:44:51] <arschmitz> sound not have an issue with
[07:45:36] <arschmitz> execpt with out the right in it lol typo
[07:48:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: html>/**/body    what does that target?
[07:49:10] <arschmitz> it exclued ie6 and 7
[07:49:26] <arschmitz> they dont allow comments inside a css selector
[07:49:34] <arschmitz> everything else does because its valid
[07:50:36] <uGoMobi> hmm
[07:51:07] <arschmitz> i tried it in the w3.org validator to be sure its fine
[07:51:08] <uGoMobi> besides that's ugly... can we be sure no other browser that we support will be excluded?
[07:51:27] <uGoMobi> Wilto: what do you say about that? ^^
[07:51:49] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if it did wouldnt be a big deal
[07:52:37] <arschmitz> it just makes it work the ie7 way which all that means is clicks on highlight target left vs closest
[07:53:20] <Wilto> html>/**/
[07:53:22] <Wilto> oh god what
[07:53:48] <Wilto> 1) That’s valid, yeah.
[07:53:53] <Wilto> 2) That’s a new one on me.
[07:54:11] <arschmitz> Wilto: i got it from paul irish
[07:54:20] <Wilto> irish, you magnificent bastard
[07:54:58] <Wilto> Wait.
[07:55:37] <Wilto> Oh, ugh, IE7, yeah.
[07:56:05] <arschmitz> Wilto: yeah best browser ever no bugs at all
[07:58:35] <Wilto> Where’s this, now? Slider?
[07:58:52] <Wilto> Oh, got it.
[07:58:54] <arschmitz> it no where now want to use it to set something only on ie7 on rangesldier
[07:59:02] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15Tomeor opened issue #5398: White line flashing at bottom during page transition !  02http://git.io/XmnIcw
[07:59:11] <Wilto> What’s being set?
[07:59:15] <arschmitz> height
[07:59:23] <arschmitz> to 0
[07:59:45] <Wilto> wat
[08:00:21] <arschmitz> Wilto: its to work around ie7 handleing z-index wrong for absolute position
[08:00:22] <Wilto> Well, stick with it for the time being—cool if I take a crack at it once it’s pushed somewhere? I bet we can work around IE7.
[08:00:33] <arschmitz> wilto sure
[08:00:53] <arschmitz> if i could get it to click through a transparent div like it should that would be better but just wont work
[08:01:42] <arschmitz> Wilto: im open to a better way for sure lol
[08:02:56] <arschmitz> Wilto: a way to target ie7 would also be much much better then excluding it like this 
[08:10:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you run slider tests after you made changes?
[08:10:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: to slider?
[08:11:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes and I know I broke them
[08:12:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: have to update the tests
[08:12:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok cool
[08:12:17] <arschmitz> because of the wrapper im guessing?
[08:12:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes and change of the class name
[08:12:44] <arschmitz> ah yeah that too
[08:12:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was planning on doing that together with adding tests for rangeslider
[08:12:58] <arschmitz> i saw it happend at that commit so i figgured
[08:13:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sounds good
[08:13:41] <uGoMobi> as long as it is in a branch we don't ring any bells yet with the failing tests ;-)
[08:14:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup i had just been running the tests before i pushed and was like hold the phone!
[08:14:18] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:14:33] <uGoMobi> yeah your screen turns red when you run the tests
[08:15:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah and i had just made changes to slider so i thought it was me

[09:25:52] <johnbend1r> :)
[09:25:59] <toddmparker> great minds...
[09:27:11] <toddmparker> few quick topics: testing (if anything left), range slider, basetag
[09:27:25] <toddmparker> is arschmitz, uGoMobi , _|Nix|_ or anyone else hopping on?
[09:27:49] <arschmitz> i will sorry wasent paying attention
[09:31:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am here
[09:31:59] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: hangout?
[09:32:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/a62ddfa12e14abca6e30d0ff44acf0079e37b98e?hl=en
[10:19:28] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you take a look at slider.js to see what is the best way to wrap not only the input and slider but also the label?
[10:19:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so johnbender: made a good point the rangeslider throws some pretty messed up values 
[10:19:47] <uGoMobi> aii
[10:19:54] <arschmitz> but its easily fixed
[10:19:59] <uGoMobi> :D
[10:20:08] <arschmitz> instead of binding to change
[10:20:20] <arschmitz> or rather
[10:20:32] <arschmitz> make it so we can return false on the original change event
[10:20:38] <arschmitz> and only emit the one from refresh
[10:20:56] <uGoMobi> we have slidestart and slideend events right?
[10:21:04] <arschmitz> yes
[10:21:04] <uGoMobi> or whatever the exact name is
[10:21:42] <uGoMobi> so we would have to tell people they should only use those and dont use change
[10:21:49] <arschmitz> but change is the issue its fired with crazy values when you are dragging and try to drag one handle past the other
[10:22:01] <arschmitz> that would work too
[10:22:03] <uGoMobi> ah i see
[10:22:33] <arschmitz> perhaps do both
[10:22:59] <arschmitz> recomend they bind to start and end events because change happens a LOT and they are essentially throttled change
[10:23:00] <uGoMobi> thats better of course
[10:23:04] <uGoMobi> if you can fix it
[10:23:26] <uGoMobi> yeah... people have been begging for those events
[10:23:32] <uGoMobi> and i understand
[10:23:34] <arschmitz> but also return false on any change that is max < min
[10:23:45] <uGoMobi> so now they should use them too :)
[10:24:07] <arschmitz> its only one additional line of code to make it sane
[10:24:17] <uGoMobi> ok nice
[10:24:28] <arschmitz> ill do it now before johnbender notices ha ha ha 
[10:24:34] <uGoMobi> lol
[10:24:51] <uGoMobi> I will give that Chrome issue another look
[10:25:13] <uGoMobi> and unit tests
[10:25:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that and tests i think are our last blockers
[10:25:35] <uGoMobi> yup
[10:26:21] <arschmitz> nice
[10:27:18] <uGoMobi>  arschmitz: did you see this line... can you take a look at slider.js to see what is the best way to wrap not only the input and slider but also the label?
[10:27:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah ill look it it right after i add the return false
[10:28:16] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it will break my slider CSS, but that's the only way to get the input next to the label
[10:28:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok cool... thanks a lot!
[10:28:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem
[10:29:01] <uGoMobi> i want to fix that in the "range" branch, because any change to slider might affect rangeslider
[10:29:20] <uGoMobi> ok dinner time
[10:30:25] <uGoMobi> johnbender: can you check the 6 "base tag" issues to see if there duplicates in there https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?labels=Base+tag&page=1&sort=updated&state=open  Thanks!
[10:34:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool im heading to lunch soon we can talk when your back
[10:40:05] <arschmitz> johnbender: you here?
[10:40:37] <arschmitz> or toddmparker
[10:44:25] <arschmitz> scottjehl_____: maybe
[10:45:15] <arschmitz> how about johnbend1r: 
[10:46:23] <arschmitz> anyway whenever any one shows up general question in the case that your dragging one handle and you hit the second handle should we continue to fire change events with the same value over and over as someone trys to drag or should we eat those ?
[10:49:21] <johnbend1r> uGoMobi: top one's a dup I think
[10:49:57] <johnbend1r> uGoMobi: close the one from knightcode, I asked for feedback and got noen
[10:50:17] <johnbend1r> *closed
[10:51:21] <arschmitz> johnbend1r: did you see my question above?
[10:51:29] <johnbend1r> looking
[10:52:00] <johnbend1r> arschmitz: seems like we shouldn't given that it's not dragging
[10:52:03] <johnbend1r> not sure though
[10:52:20] <arschmitz> its simple either way just need to decide how it "should" be 
[10:52:21] <johnbend1r> scottjehl______: and toddmparker_ might have thoughts on that though
[10:53:13] <arschmitz> johnbend1r: it essentially answers your question from before too though i guess lol
[10:53:38] <johnbend1r> hmm, I  was thinking more that the order of when things are bound becomes important
[10:53:51] <johnbend1r> as long as the user bindings are always going to be fired afterward
[10:53:52] <johnbend1r> then it's fine
[10:54:02] <johnbend1r> I don't know how/when users are binding those events now
[10:54:23] <arschmitz> johnbend1r: ahh i see
[10:54:49] <arschmitz> johnbend1r: well ill let you look and give feedback
[10:54:57] <johnbend1r> word
[12:25:33] <johnbender> arschmitz: I am now
[12:25:50] <johnbender> argh

[13:03:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ^^changed your wrapper like you asked
[13:03:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: oh perfect, thanks!
[13:04:02] <uGoMobi> I will fix the CSS then
[13:04:04] <arschmitz> no prob didnt add a single line
[13:05:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also i forgot that when i changed some stuff i already had it eating the erroneous change events with crazy values so i didnt have to do that
[13:05:19] <uGoMobi> lemme check what i did wrong
[13:05:53] <arschmitz> oh i see some missing white space in what i changed lol
[13:07:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: want your oppinion on something
[13:07:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: when you try to drag one handle past the other should it keep fireing change with the same value or should we eat all those extra change events?
[13:09:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I say eat
[13:09:26] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: because there is no actual change
[13:09:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats +2 for eat johnbender agrees as well
[13:09:58] <arschmitz> so i think ill change it to eat them right now they keep fireing

[13:22:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so i added a beforechange event that we return false on if min >= max
[13:22:45] <arschmitz> so it will never trigger change
[13:23:06] <arschmitz> and we can examin values before change to stop it from being called on anything weird
[13:24:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this is the only "Weird" case i know of lol but incase johnbender: finds anything else lol
[13:24:36] <johnbender> :)
[13:26:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: well done!
[13:28:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah figure since we are monkeying with values best to have our own event to do it on so we are not using the change event like other people bind to leave that alone 
[13:28:27] <uGoMobi> agreed

[13:28:57] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06range 14cbf69fd 15Alexander Schmitz: Slider: fixed lint issue
[13:42:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: kinda found the chrome issue
[13:49:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: its a chrome bug
[13:50:12] <arschmitz> that specificly messes with float:right and resize where it wont redraw
[13:55:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm... maybe i can set some useless property that changes at 28em to force the redraw
[13:55:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol thats what iv been trying 
[13:55:44] <uGoMobi> haha
[13:55:56] <arschmitz> no luck yet but theres gotta be something
[13:58:00] <arschmitz> i found a few workarounds but none really work 
[13:58:14] <arschmitz> incresing specificity was one but didnt work for me
[13:58:26] <arschmitz> and float:left is not effected
[14:01:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think i have a solution
[14:01:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the display property might work
[14:01:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i tried that didnt work for me but maybe a different combo then i tried
[14:02:26] <arschmitz> but if you set label,firstinput,rangesliders all float left and second input float right and adjust left and right margins it works
[14:03:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: see any down side to that?
[14:03:54] <uGoMobi> setting float left for the first input wont work in fieldcontain if i am not mistaken
[14:04:11] <arschmitz> i tried it in fieldcontain works fine
[14:04:24] <arschmitz> thats the only place that bug effected so its actually the only place i tested lol
[14:05:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it breaks on this page http://jquerymobile.com/branches/range/docs/demos/sliders/sliders.html
[14:06:00] <arschmitz> thats where i am lol
[14:06:11] <arschmitz> hold on left me double check what im doing lol
[14:06:23] <uGoMobi> set float left for the first input and it ends up at the left edge
[14:08:34] <arschmitz> not if you set float:left on the label
[14:09:30] <arschmitz> hold on ill push to my fork and update on my server so you can see
[14:09:42] <arschmitz> just need to adjust margins for mini first
[14:10:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok
[14:10:39] <uGoMobi> we can do that for rangeslider label... cos it has wrapper div and i added a clearfix
[14:13:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[14:13:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ill just push the change 
[14:13:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure

[14:14:43] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06range 1490f0fda 15Alexander Schmitz: Rangeslider: change to float:left to avoid a bug in chrome with float:right
[14:15:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so is that our last bug then other then finishing your adjustments to slider for the new wrapper div?
[14:15:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yessss
[14:15:22] <arschmitz> Nice!!
[14:15:26] <arschmitz> getting close
[14:15:32] <uGoMobi> nice indeed
[14:15:44] <uGoMobi> then only unit tests
[14:16:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup those shouldnt be too bad fixing the slider ones should be easy
[14:16:11] <uGoMobi> i will finish that stuff soon so we can have the others check the code and merge in master
[14:16:24] <arschmitz> and there wont bee too many range ones since slider tests cover most of it
[14:16:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah no worries
[14:18:29] <uGoMobi> ok i am calling it a day
