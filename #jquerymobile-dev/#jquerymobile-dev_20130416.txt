[03:19:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ping!
[04:07:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong!
[04:11:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[04:11:25] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[04:12:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was thinking about speeding up buttonMarkup by adding an option to not store any $.data - meaning the element is not likely to be re-enhanced.
[04:12:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: $.data inside buttonMarkup is only necessary so the next time you call buttonMarkup on any of the elements that have been created/modified by a previous call to buttonMarkup that second call behaves correctly.
[04:12:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I still hope we can do without buttonMarkup at all
[04:13:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know.
[04:13:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Stll, in the meantime, I'd like to try to make it faster.
[04:14:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... while retaining the ability to modify an existing button via a subsequent call to buttonMarkup.
[04:14:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[04:14:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm just not clear on how listview uses buttonMarkup. Does it ever call buttonMarkup on an already-enhanced button?
[04:15:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not completely sure
[04:18:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. In the meantime, I've replaced the .jqmData() calls in listview with the new $.mobile.getAttribute, to see how much of a boost we can get.
[04:18:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. In the meantime, I've replaced the .jqmData() calls in listview with the new $.mobile.getAttribute, to see how much of a boost we can get.
[04:18:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see last paragraph http://view.jquerymobile.com/old-docs/docs/lists/docs-lists.html
[04:19:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, sweet!
[04:20:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That means listview would benefit from such a modification.
[04:20:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you would have to check list dividers too though
[04:20:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, if we were to actually implement on-the-fly options for listview, we'd /have to/ re-enhance listview items.
[04:20:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Of course, that would be lightning fast if getting rid of buttonMarkup would be possible.
[04:21:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: true, but that goes for all buttons I supposed
[04:21:21] <uGoMobi> s/supposed/suppose/
[04:21:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, but individual buttons can keep the $.data, because re-enhancing a single button is no big deal.
[04:22:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[04:22:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's why I'd make it a parameter. Like: $.fn.buttonMarkup( options, reEnhanceable );
[04:22:45] <uGoMobi> talking about buttons, looks like something is broken now http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/listviews/
[04:23:10] <uGoMobi> or is that because work in progress?
[04:23:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not on master ... maybe its built wrong ...
[04:24:16] <_|Nix|_> Weird ... no JS errors ...
[04:24:32] <uGoMobi> I thought view isn't a build
[04:25:00] <_|Nix|_> No, I guess it's not.
[04:25:03] <_|Nix|_> WTF?!
[04:25:26] <_|Nix|_> The front page is fine ... 
[04:25:30] <_|Nix|_> Extremely weird ...
[04:25:36] <_|Nix|_> Maybe the path is wrong ... ?
[04:25:57] <uGoMobi> if I use http://code.jquery.com/mobile/git/jquery.mobile-git.js and .css as source it's fine too
[04:26:32] <_|Nix|_> Very weird ...
[04:26:42] <_|Nix|_> The paths in <head> seem OK ...
[04:26:49] <uGoMobi> very weird indeed... it's not on all pages
[04:32:50] <uGoMobi> seems to be only that listview page, I will look into it
[04:43:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's not just on view ... it's happening locally as well.
[04:54:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am on branch "next" and there I don't see the issue
[04:55:15] <uGoMobi> must be a regression
[04:55:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ...
[04:56:53] <uGoMobi> only see it on that listview page... could it have to do with nested listviews?
[04:58:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Found it (via bisect). My bad, it seems.
[04:59:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Something I did with the registry.
[04:59:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see, glad you found it
[04:59:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but why only on that page?
[05:00:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe it's the order in which the enhancers get called - or maybe one gets skipped for some reason.
[05:00:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll have a look ...
[05:01:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, thanks

[06:40:18] <toddmparker> How is the widget standardization going?
[06:40:44] <toddmparker> uGoMobi has been making good progress on the CSS side of things 
[07:40:10] * gseguin is thinking of going back to bed after the snow shoveling session
[08:46:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I found a bug in the registry I merged yesterday ... working on it ...
[09:28:07] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: toddmparker: arschmitz: uGoMobi: anyone around to discuss this with me?
[09:28:18] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5284
[09:28:21] <arschmitz> johnbender whats up
[09:28:43] <arschmitz> johnbender: reading it now
[09:28:45] <johnbender> arschmitz: so we've provided the ability to prevent page init
[09:29:11] <johnbender> but that conflicts with reseting the page on a popstate when returning from an external document
[09:29:21] <johnbender> there are two options
[09:29:32] <johnbender> (to my mind at least)
[09:29:52] <johnbender> 1. Store all popstates until the page init is fired and resolve (complex)
[09:30:09] <johnbender> 2. Ignore popstates until page init is fired (simple)
[09:30:36] <johnbender> I'm inclined to do the second one since this bug only appeared recently though it should have been an issue in older versions
[09:30:42] <johnbender> meaning I don't think  it affects that many users
[09:30:53] <arschmitz> downside being we will miss info from the inital popstate?
[09:30:57] <johnbender> right
[09:31:01] <johnbender> "it's your problem"
[09:31:22] <johnbender> it doesn't seem unreasonable to say "we can't deal with the popstates until the framework initialized"
[09:31:23] <arschmitz> so basicly it wont save the page state info and will be like a refresh when you go back?
[09:31:38] <johnbender> the page state will be available
[09:31:44] <johnbender> the framework just won't make use of it
[09:31:58] <arschmitz> right
[09:32:02] <johnbender> that is, an binding to popstate outside the framework would get all the right data
[09:32:07] <johnbender> s/an/a/
[09:32:27] <johnbender> the first option seems like a complexity nightmare
[09:32:35] <arschmitz> yeah i think that seems like the most sane and reasonable approach
[09:32:41] <johnbender> alright
[09:32:52] <johnbender> thanks for the second opinion
[09:32:54] <johnbender> I'll go hack that in
[09:32:57] <arschmitz> if you are going to handle init on your own you have to also deal with this edge case if you want state maintatined
[09:33:13] <arschmitz> otherwise it will work fine and just wont maintain state
[09:33:49] <johnbender> yep
[09:33:51] <johnbender> that seems fair to me
[09:34:00] <arschmitz> yeah i think so
[09:34:09] <johnbender> sane defaults, but won't break if you want to do something weird 
[09:34:12] <johnbender> == framework
[09:34:38] <arschmitz> yeah i totally agree the complexity of maintaining state for a non default edge case seems unreasonable

[10:44:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: arschmitz: so my solution was to move the nav ready bindings into page init
[10:44:44] <johnbender> keep an eye out for navigation oddities
[10:44:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I cherry picked it over to 1.3-stable too
[10:45:25] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok, thanks
[10:47:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[10:47:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What's up?
[10:47:39] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: just that
[10:47:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's cool ...
[10:48:02] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I since you're the next most informed person on Nav I wanted to make sure you knew about it in case someone came to you with something weird
[10:48:13] <johnbender> now you can tell them it's my fault :)
[10:48:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Thanks!
[10:48:18] <_|Nix|_> :)
[10:48:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's a load / binding order thing and those tend to be confusing / insidious
[10:48:38] <johnbender> otherwise I wouldn't bother everyone
[10:48:51] <_|Nix|_> Indeed ...
[10:50:16] <_|Nix|_> ... and I just realized that my enhance() function is not reentrant :/

[10:59:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ping https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3602
[10:59:59] <johnbender> what's the replacement for the "all things are enhanced" event?
[11:00:05] <johnbender> if we are deprecating pageinit
[11:00:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Interesting question ...
[11:00:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I could have the registry emit some signal ...
[11:00:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Like "enhancecomplete" or something ...
[11:01:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that makes sense
[11:01:16] <johnbender> I'm just moving the _createWidget patch over to page
[11:01:17] <johnbender> right now
[11:01:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... where e.target would be whatever was passed into enhance()
[11:01:24] <johnbender> so that will partially address the problem
[11:01:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we can bikeshed about the name
[11:01:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Sure ... 
[11:02:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm, I wonder if it wouldn't make sense to have it triggerd on a page container?
[11:02:33] <johnbender> whenever that widget gets created
[11:02:44] <johnbender> er
[11:02:47] <johnbender> ContentContainer 
[11:02:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Actually, I can trigger it on the element passed in.
[11:03:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It will bubble ...
[11:03:09] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I meant more for naming purposes
[11:03:17] <johnbender> well
[11:03:28] <johnbender> and also for reasoning about its meaning
[11:04:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: to me it makes sense to have a post init event for all the different widgets
[11:04:24] <johnbender> which was why I did it that way
[11:04:49] <johnbender> that is, signalling that something is done enhancing is the job of the widget itself
[11:04:54] <johnbender> since it knows that it's finished
[11:05:07] <johnbender> page init is just a special case
[11:05:17] <johnbender> in the sense that it's what people want to use most often
[11:05:21] <johnbender> but not special in any other way
[11:05:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yes, but the initial question was "when is everything enhanced"? That is, all widgets ...
[11:05:38] <johnbender> and the answer was `pageinit`
[11:05:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's bad, because that assumes widgets are on pages.
[11:05:57] <johnbender> right!
[11:06:03] <johnbender> but it doesn't have to
[11:06:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, I'm suggesting that the registry enhance an element and then trigger some signal on it.
[11:06:13] <johnbender> recall that if it's not in a page you can still bind to <widget>init
[11:06:23] <johnbender> that was my whole point
[11:06:32] <johnbender> `pageinit` is only special because it's what people most often want
[11:06:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Is <widget>create emitted before the widget is actually created?
[11:06:52] <johnbender> no idea
[11:07:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I *think* so
[11:07:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yes
[11:07:48] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/b982e2f3ee426ed41b122f58e3494cfe6d27f52d/js/jquery.mobile.widget.js#L19
[11:07:59] <johnbender> oops wrong link
[11:08:06] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/b982e2f3ee426ed41b122f58e3494cfe6d27f52d/js/jquery.ui.widget.js#L251
[11:08:14] <johnbender> borrowed that from the issue description
[11:08:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: font icons test https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdEFwbzNFSmJjWUd1dkZldDY4MVFyR0E#gid=0
[11:09:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Ummm ... so, it's called after _create() ... so that would indicate that the widget is already alive and kicking when <widget>create is issued.
[11:09:31] <johnbender> hmm
[11:09:48] <johnbender> I assume that's why Jorn made the reference
[11:10:22] <johnbender> so
[11:10:48] <johnbender> create is sufficient to replace init for widgets
[11:10:55] <johnbender> in ... all cases?
[11:11:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: As it stands, pagecreate will be called after all enhancement is complete, because page calls $.mobile._enhancer.enhance( this.element[ 0 ]
[11:11:07] <_|Nix|_>  ) during create ...
[11:11:18] <johnbender> ok
[11:11:19] <johnbender> so
[11:11:28] <johnbender> we're simply saying to people
[11:11:35] <johnbender> pagecreate works again lolol
[11:11:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yep.
[11:11:55] <johnbender> (the reason we created init was because switching to pagecreate bindings broke timing)
[11:12:04] <johnbender> that's perfect
[11:12:09] <johnbender> it works in all cases
[11:12:11] <johnbender> lovely
[11:12:27] <johnbender> so really what we're doing is JUST deprecating `init`
[11:12:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I believe so, since there are no more pagecreate bindings ...
[11:12:38] <johnbender> winner
[11:13:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and there's only one "create" binding for backwards compat.
[11:13:05] <_|Nix|_> nl
[11:13:08] <johnbender> yep
[11:13:10] <johnbender> pageinit
[11:13:14] <johnbender> hence the move into the page widget
[11:13:15] <johnbender> alright
[11:13:17] <johnbender> that's easy
[11:13:29] <johnbender> I'll move the method and add teh deprecation notice to the docs
[11:13:36] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[11:13:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: 1000 thanks for talking through that with me

[11:14:12] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: NP.
[11:15:11] <_|Nix|_> I still have to push my fix for that st00pid reentrance issue ... you can't mark a node as visited by updating anything inside it. Instead, you have to add the node to a hash of visited items.
[11:19:02] <_|Nix|_> Score one /in favour/ (believe it or not) of nested lists ...
[11:19:47] <_|Nix|_> Creating new pages while enhancing a given page has exposed the limitation of the registry.
[11:23:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: strange that unit tests didn't fail
[11:24:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ... anyway, I'll add a unit test to make sure the registry works OK. The good news is it's really easy to test.
[11:24:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: cool
[11:24:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: would prefetching pages show the same issue/
[11:24:34] <uGoMobi> ?
[11:28:27] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I don't think we enhance on prefetch do we?

[11:28:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No idea. The fact is that, if you run an enhance while running an enhance, the original enhance would not complete correctly.
[11:29:36] <johnbender> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: nevermind prefetch calls loadpage, and loadpage calls enhance :(
[11:30:13] <uGoMobi> johnbender: thanks for checking, wasn't sure either
[11:30:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That should be fine after I push my next commit - just waiting for the unit tests.
[11:30:56] <_|Nix|_> ... not that those would be any indication ... they didn't fail when I committed the regression ... still, maybe I broke something ...

[13:01:23] <johnbender> it doesn't look like there are stable branches etc
[13:01:42] <johnbender> ie, I want to add a "deprecated in 1.4" but I'm not sure if master is the place for that in api.jquerymobile.com

[13:50:04] <agcolom> Hi! what's up? how can I help
[13:50:05] <agcolom> ?
[13:50:49] <agcolom> johnbender: uGoMobi I can update/tag the api docs whenever... i.e. today?

[14:05:57] <agcolom> johnbender: yes all goes in master. Then I can just tag whenever we want for a build version
[14:08:27] <johnbender> agcolom: but what if we want to release documentation updates for 1.3.2 for example
[14:08:38] <johnbender> then all the stuff for 1.4 will end up in the docs
[14:08:54] <johnbender> agcolom: uGoMobi: maybe we should chat about this on Thursday?
[14:11:17] <agcolom> yes, we can talk about it on thursday... I think we can add what version things apply to in the docs. will have to double check with scottjehl 
[14:11:34] <agcolom> sorry with scott_gonzalez 
[14:12:06] <agcolom> (although will be tricky as celebrating my son's birthday!)
[14:13:11] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi Scott! Are you still around?
