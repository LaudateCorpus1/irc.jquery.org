[07:56:30] <_nickel> todd_: alright I'm omw to my office space I'll be back on in about an hour
[09:11:52] <_nickel> toddparker: wanted to double check something
[09:11:58] <_nickel> pushstate and then the dom caching
[09:12:05] <toddparker> hey _nickel
[09:12:05] <_nickel> I was going to test the changes in those branches
[09:12:11] <toddparker> cool
[09:12:15] <_nickel> thats what I have down in my notes
[09:12:25] <_nickel> then I'm going to work on getting hudson set up
[09:12:30] <_nickel> err jenkins :(
[09:12:31] <toddparker> yeah, need help looking at those
[09:12:36] <toddparker> cool
[09:12:43] <_nickel> anything else thats more pressing since we chatted on Thurs?
[09:12:45] <toddparker> settling in?
[09:12:56] <_nickel> toddparker: something like that :D
[09:13:59] <toddparker> scott renamed the branch "ajax dom caching"
[09:14:08] <toddparker> if you look at that now, it would be great
[09:14:14] <toddparker> pushstate can be later
[09:14:18] <_nickel> cool
[09:14:19] <_nickel> will do
[09:15:50] <toddparker> there was an issue you could look at
[09:15:51] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1554#issuecomment-1503058
[09:15:54] <toddparker> in that branch
[09:19:11] <toddparker> i think we should re-name the option from data-ajax-dom-caching
[09:19:22] <toddparker> to "data-ajax-dom-cache"
[09:19:25] <toddparker> whatcha think
[09:19:49] <toddparker> but anyway, give it some testing and see if you can see any edge cases where we could run into issues
[09:19:55] <toddparker> if it looks good, we can land it today
[09:19:57] <gseguin> side note on our data attributes
[09:20:09] <gseguin> why don't we have a jqm namespace?
[09:20:36] <toddparker> it just makes the attrs so much mor everbose
[09:20:48] <toddparker> you can choose to namespace them. we spent a lot of time adding that feature
[09:21:03] <gseguin> I saw that yeah
[09:22:14] <gseguin> another question I had was, why do we use the nstest namespace in our tests? Is there a reason behind this?
[09:22:27] <toddparker> bender - other things that could be helpful (but less time sensitive) = reviewing pull requests, adding unit tests for some plugins with none
[09:22:46] <toddparker> we use the namespace in tests to make sure that that works
[09:22:54] <gseguin> heh
[09:22:57] <gseguin> :)
[09:22:59] <toddparker> since it touches everything
[09:23:00] <gseguin> ok
[09:23:17] <toddparker> that was a bear to add so we alwasy add a ns to make sure we're watching it
[09:23:34] <toddparker> so gseguin - are you working on stuff today?
[09:23:36] <gseguin> makes sense
[09:24:00] <gseguin> nope  Jivin' most of the day
[09:24:25] <gseguin> unless there is something urgent
[09:26:40] <_nickel> toddparker: so there appears to be two issues from that thread
[09:26:46] <_nickel> the second one is a bit harder to understand
[09:27:24] <_nickel> but it looks like he's using a form and a dialog in concert to fill out hte form
[09:27:56] <_nickel> when the dialog comes up obviously the form page is removed along with the values the user entered with it
[09:28:34] <_nickel> toddparker: I'd actually like to think of a better name for that all around
[09:29:06] <_nickel> toddparker: hard to though without making it too general
[09:30:07] <toddparker> right, but if you add this attr, it should leave the page alone when a new page is shown
[09:30:18] <toddparker> wouldn't that fix this issue?
[09:30:31] <toddparker> agree on the names
[09:31:10] <_nickel> toddparker: I'm pretty sure it would, just wanted to make sure I grok'd the issue before diving in
[09:31:15] <_nickel> I'll look into the back button
[09:40:23] <_nickel> toddparker: confirme applying the attribute to the form page solves smoothcontract's issue
[09:40:29] <_nickel> *confirmed
[09:45:58] <_nickel> gseguin: toddparker: any idea how to get syntax highlighting in my issue/pull request comments, or is it auto?
[09:47:04] <gseguin> _nickel: ```javascript
[09:47:12] <_nickel> tripple backticks
[09:47:16] <_nickel> to begin and end?
[09:47:21] <gseguin> yeah
[09:47:27] <_nickel> super nice
[09:47:30] <_nickel> gseguin: many thanks sir
[09:47:37] <gseguin> and you can specify the language after the opening backticks
[09:47:44] <gseguin> you're welcome
[09:58:09] <toddparker> fancy
[09:58:14] <toddparker> you can also indent by 4 spaces
[10:01:24] <_nickel> yah but that just gives the basic block quote unless they are sniffing
[10:01:47] <_nickel> the tripple backticks gives me the highlighting
[10:01:56] <_nickel> you can check that issue at the bottom for ```html ``` example
[10:01:58] <_nickel> works brilliantly
[10:09:21] <_nickel> toddparker: issue updated, I can't really repro the second issue and the first is a feature imo
[10:09:28] <_nickel> one that might have bizarre consequences
[10:09:46] <_nickel> and be hard to implement
[10:10:02] <_nickel> going to noodle a bit on he naming
[10:10:17] <toddparker> ok
[10:10:33] <toddparker> i wouldn't worry too much about that second issue
[10:10:56] <toddparker> i'm more concerned that we missed a scenario where deleting a page would be bad news
[10:18:32] <_nickel> toddparker: ok I'll noodle a bit while I grab a snack :D
[10:27:05] <scottjehl> hey
[10:27:27] <gseguin> hey Scott
[10:28:08] <scottjehl> how goes?
[10:28:28] <gseguin> pretty good, you?
[10:28:44] <scottjehl> looks like the ajax-dom-caching branch is about ready to land
[10:28:50] <scottjehl> good thanks
[10:28:50] <gseguin> I haven't made very noticeable progress on the transitions thing :(
[10:29:07] <scottjehl> that's cool. I should have time this week to look at that and pushState
[10:29:19] <gseguin> everytime I try something new, it changes for better on one platform and for worse on another one
[10:30:54] <gseguin> I'm thinking one of the problem could be that we have 2 animations going on at the same time
[10:34:34] <scottjehl> not sure
[10:34:54] <scottjehl> doesn't seem to cause trouble with keyframes when we do that
[10:35:08] <scottjehl> but I'm hoping to take a look today
[10:35:13] <gseguin> with keyframes we were just sliding in
[10:35:25] <gseguin> not sliding out the previous page
[10:35:50] <scottjehl> not sure I follow
[10:36:15] <scottjehl> both pages slide together on separate animations in master
[10:36:30] <scottjehl> except for slideup and down I think
[10:36:55] * gseguin may be wrong, checking
[10:39:56] <gseguin> yeah you're right, then I don't know
[10:40:50] <scottjehl> hey _nickel, thanks for following up on that thread
[10:41:00] <scottjehl> sounds like that branch is close to ready?
[10:41:23] <_nickel> scottjehl: yes I'm going to look at the test you have in place
[10:41:37] <_nickel> you guys have already done a fair amount of thinking around potential issues here eh?
[10:41:57] <scottjehl> well, some
[10:42:17] <scottjehl> mainly, the changes affect ajax-loaded pages
[10:42:23] <_nickel> I think defaulting to not caching is generally a less buggy solution
[10:42:26] <scottjehl> the part in navigation js is quite small
[10:42:44] <_nickel> maybe I should take a deep look at the listview impact?
[10:42:57] <_nickel> I didn't quite understand that addition
[10:43:00] <scottjehl> well, yeah ideally. Though defaulting to caching means no change
[10:44:16] <_nickel> not caching provides behavior which is consistent with what people expect out of ajax requests
[10:44:36] <_nickel> its a performance optimization where necessary
[10:45:02] <_nickel> which is something people should only really apply after examining how users are using their applications
[10:45:26] <_nickel> ie "Ahh we see that this page rarely if ever changes and people use it a ton. cache it"
[10:45:30] <_nickel> via analytics
[10:45:33] <_nickel> ok
[10:45:36] <_nickel> enough pontificating
[10:45:41] <_nickel> I'll look at the listview change
[11:15:59] <_nickel> gs
[11:16:09] * _nickel is in the wrong windo
[11:18:40] <_nickel> scottjehl: hmm I'm confused here, the commit you link to in that issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1554#issuecomment-1503058
[11:18:50] <_nickel> what branch is that on
[11:19:04] <_nickel> I can't find your listview changes anywhere
[11:38:54] <_nickel> scottjehl: https://gist.github.com/4cfdec9302d5f4d8af65
[11:39:55] <scottjehl> hmm. yeah I made a new branch because rebase was being impossible
[11:40:05] <scottjehl> maybe the listview change isn't in now?
[11:41:05] <_nickel> doesn't look like it
[11:42:39] <scottjehl> ruh rob
[11:42:49] <scottjehl> * ruh roh
[11:43:01] <scottjehl> k hang tite
[11:43:30] <_nickel> scottjehl: https://gist.github.com/4cfdec9302d5f4d8af65
[11:43:58] <_nickel> also I thought about changing this test but I think it looses the expresiveness of binding to the events
[11:44:24] <_nickel> scottjehl: either way I'm trying to avoid setTimout where I can in tests
[11:44:27] <_nickel> its so very brittle
[11:44:40] <scottjehl> oh I definitely agree
[11:44:47] <_nickel> also I'm going to add a test for a page where the cache is enabled so that we know it works
[11:44:49] <scottjehl> not sure why start is called twice in there
[11:45:03] <_nickel> scottjehl: thats a copy paste issue on my part
[11:45:05] <_nickel> not your code
[11:45:09] <scottjehl> oh ok before/after
[11:45:15] <scottjehl> I see
[11:45:42] <_nickel> scottjehl: that will cover the positive and negative cases
[11:46:03] <scottjehl> okay great.
[11:46:12] <scottjehl> I'll see if I can't dig up the listview thing
[11:46:35] <_nickel> cool
[11:54:04] <_nickel> scottjehl: pushed that test change, I'll be back after lunch to add the negative case
[11:54:12] <scottjehl> ok great thx
[12:46:50] <_nickel> scottjehl: test pushed, any luck finding that listview code?
[12:46:57] <scottjehl> yes
[12:46:59] <scottjehl> :)
[12:47:01] <scottjehl> whew
[12:47:06] <scottjehl> will push
[13:08:44] <scottjehl> almost done
[13:11:15] <_nickel> heroku logs
[13:11:17] <_nickel> oops
[13:54:34] <_nickel> gseguin: I updated the jshint service for heroku since its so painless to deploy
[13:55:12] <gseguin> _nickel: cool, I was going to put one on joyent cloud
[13:55:59] <gseguin> to try it out
[14:06:03] <_nickel> scottjehl: did you get a chance to push those changes?
[14:17:53] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: is it ok if I take a look the select menu on my own and see what I can come up with in the way of decoupling things?
[14:18:27] <scottjehl> _nickel, pushing now
[14:18:29] <toddparker> sure, go for it
[14:18:32] <scottjehl> not quite doing what we need
[14:18:33] <scottjehl> but close
[14:19:30] <_nickel> scottjehl: ahh cool
[14:19:45] <scottjehl> just pushed it tho
[14:20:03] <_nickel> I'll focus on that then
[14:20:05] <_nickel> brb
[14:20:07] <scottjehl> basically, I've got it so the whole sublist will remove when the parent page hides and the newly shown page is not a sublist
[14:20:09] <scottjehl> but
[14:20:21] <_nickel> scottjehl: yah thats what it looked like
[14:20:28] <_nickel> I'll put in some tests if nothing else
[14:21:01] <scottjehl> my commit says it , but basically, unbinding the pagehide doesn't seem to be preventing that page from removal on hide
[14:21:03] <scottjehl> the parent page that is
[14:21:43] <_nickel> hmm
[14:22:57] <scottjehl> as for select - yeah I left that wide open
[14:23:11] <scottjehl> the selectmenu.custom.js file is basically empty
[14:23:30] <scottjehl> the regular file works well for default selects, afaik
[14:23:35] <scottjehl> anyway, have at it!
[14:23:49] <scottjehl> people will definitely not miss those 400 lines if they don't need em :)
[14:28:58] <scottjehl> gotta run!
