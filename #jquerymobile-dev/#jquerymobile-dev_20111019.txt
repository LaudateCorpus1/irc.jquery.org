[07:12:49] <Wilto> Whatup, guys.
[07:13:17] <jzaefferer> Wilto, STOP
[07:13:27] <Wilto> Oh god what did I do.
[07:13:29] <jzaefferer> HAMMERTIME
[07:13:35] <Wilto> AWW SHEEIT
[07:13:55] <jzaefferer> (that's all I got)
[07:14:39] <toddparker> hey all
[07:14:42] <toddparker> catching up
[07:15:29] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/mchammer.gif
[07:15:39] <toddparker> The reason we use pixels instead of ems was to avoid a lot of confusion. We used ems on jQuery UI's themes and when using relative sizes, things get very unpredictable when you nest elements
[07:15:59] <jzaefferer> Wilto: nice
[07:16:03] <toddparker> We had so many questions/bug reports about thing being "the wrong size"
[07:17:30] <toddparker> I agree that using relative units is the way to go, but it requires more planning and expertise by the developer. karlsberg87 - it would be pretty easy to write CSS overrides to switch to this mode as you discussed.
[07:18:11] <toddparker> We may need to re-visit this at a later point, but I haven't seen any serious issues with the current approach on our test devices
[07:18:14] <Wilto> There’s always rem units.
[07:19:27] <Wilto> They’re well supported (apart from IE), so there would still be some kludginess involved.
[07:20:03] <Wilto> Please apply that end paren where you feel it would be most appropriate in that sentence, as it is still early and I don’t English goodly.
[07:22:44] <toddparker> worth looking into Wilto
[07:23:39] <Wilto> For sure. Not something for today by any means, but worth experimenting at some point.
[07:23:41] <Wilto> http://caniuse.com/#search=rem
[07:23:50] <Wilto> http://snook.ca/archives/html_and_css/font-size-with-rem
[07:25:35] <jzaefferer> are those related to a certain band or a certain british web designer?
[07:30:39] <Wilto> When I heard REM was breaking up, I bolted for the CSS Values and Units spec. Just in case.
[07:49:37] <kinblas> toddparker: ping ... I have not added any docs yet
[08:13:18] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[08:13:29] <toddparker> i'm happy to do it if you are busy
[08:13:39] <toddparker> thinking it will just be a few sentence
[08:14:27] <toddparker> what's on your plate right now kinblas
[08:14:46] <toddparker> i'm wrapping up the blog post and Mat and I are doing final device testing
[08:14:53] <toddparker> seems like this is a solid RC
[08:15:07] <toddparker> I can move the remaining RC2 issues to final
[08:15:34] <toddparker> kinblas: I saw you commented on this issue
[08:15:36] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2725
[08:15:37] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2725 on jquery-mobile, reported by jeroenvandijk (2d, 2h ago): Version change Beta3 to RC1 has broken a configuration option?
[08:16:20] <toddparker> where do you and bender land with the option to really shut off link handling?
[08:16:39] <toddparker> that is different than this issues, but realted
[08:27:04] <toddparker> I'd like to ship RC2 earlier today so a 1:00 cutoff for changes please
[08:32:11] <kinblas> toddparker: 1:00 EST?
[08:32:47] <kinblas> toddparker: that was that bug we were going back and forth about adding the $.mobile.hijaxLinksEnabled
[08:32:57] <kinblas> or whatever johnbender wanted to call it.
[08:33:17] <kinblas> toddparker: I was referring to 2725 with what I said above
[08:33:49] <kinblas> toddparker: I've been playing with trying to capture focus/blur to fix some of the fixed header/footer problems folks are complaining about on ios and android
[08:34:27] <kinblas> unfortunately, ios and android behave differently in terms of what events they fire when bringing up a keyboard ... on top of that I need to test the different input types to see how they behave too
[08:35:53] <Wilto> kinblas: 1:00pm EST, yeah.
[08:36:19] <kinblas> Wilto: you guys and your forward clocks! That's not a lot of time :-P
[08:36:54] <kinblas> Wilto: johnbender: toddparker: would like your opinion on naming semantics for a custom event
[08:36:57] <Wilto> And people wonder why we East-coasters always seem so uptight and panicky.
[08:37:04] <kinblas> heh
[08:37:10] <Wilto> Loves me some semantics.
[08:37:59] <kinblas> I added a "contentmodified" trigger to collapsibles and listviews so that they can indicate when something has changed that may change the document dimensions ... headers/footers are listening for this event
[08:38:22] <kinblas> I've been waffling on whether I should have called it "updatelayout"
[08:38:41] <kinblas> contentmodified seems a bit generic ... and is close to the DOM subtreemodified, etc
[08:39:12] <kinblas> note the reason why I didn't go with listening to dom mutation events was because they are triggered for lots of things ... even things that don't trigger a layout
[08:39:17] <kinblas> hence the custom version
[08:39:23] <Wilto> Yeah, at a glance “contentmodified” feels like “changed some text or something.”
[08:39:30] <kinblas> so "contentmodified" or "updatelayout"?
[08:39:45] <kinblas> I want to decide before rc2 (the first release with this fix) goes out
[08:39:52] <Wilto> My vote is for “updatelayout.”
[08:40:24] <kinblas> Wilto: yeah I was leaning towards that too this morning ... it says specifically what its for
[08:40:42] <kinblas> johnbender: toddparker: ^^^?
[08:41:09] <Wilto> Todd’s stuck on a call—gonna be a few before he can chime in.
[08:42:07] <kinblas> Wilto: ah ok ... maybe I'll just change it anyways :-)
[08:42:26] <kinblas> Wilto: two minds are better than none
[08:42:31] <Wilto> Yeah, I figure he’ll be cool with it.
[08:42:46] <Wilto> Mine’s closer to 0.5 of a mind, really.
[08:43:21] <kinblas> heh
[09:08:30] <johnbender> installing the 4.0 sdk
[09:08:40] <johnbender> anyone know if they sorted border radius?
[09:08:53] <johnbender> if the browser doesn't suck I might buy an android
[09:08:56] <johnbender> if it does suck
[09:09:00] <johnbender> I'm headed elsewhere
[09:09:57] <jzaefferer> Chrome for Android would be nice
[09:10:06] <jzaefferer> kinda doubt that's in 4.0 already
[09:10:35] <johnbender> jzaefferer: it's not from what I know
[09:11:20] <jzaefferer> still: https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DO0qRHQh73I/Tp6figsv2WI/AAAAAAAAGpc/wAPD4fOS9jE/s1000/threeyears.png
[09:11:29] <johnbender> it's easy to criticize from the outside, not knowing what happens at google, but it seems very odd to me that the browser is so bad given that google is a web company
[09:11:37] <jzaefferer> I've got the Nexus S, and after seeing a Galaxy II in action, I wanna upgrade
[09:11:54] <jzaefferer> it was okay when it came out
[09:12:01] <jzaefferer> I mean the browser
[09:12:07] <jzaefferer> the Nexus S, too, though
[09:12:28] <johnbender> jzaefferer: you mean when android originally launched?
[09:13:42] <jzaefferer> dunno about originally, but like a year ago the 2.1 browser was pretty cool
[09:14:01] <jzaefferer> the column resizing was so much better then reading text on Mobile Safari
[09:14:03] <toddparker> hey guys, I'm off mey cal
[09:14:06] <jzaefferer> which still doesn't have it?
[09:14:08] <toddparker> my call, geez
[09:15:26] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[09:15:43] <toddparker> i'm torn on the naming too
[09:16:07] <toddparker> sounds like this is a signal the widget it sending out to say "I'm different"
[09:16:25] <kinblas> toddparker: I just renamed it updatelayout
[09:16:28] <kinblas> I'm updating the events doc
[09:16:32] <kinblas> to document it
[09:16:33] <toddparker> ok, sounds good
[09:16:36] <toddparker> sweet
[09:16:45] <toddparker> i'm going through the RC1 issues now
[09:16:53] <toddparker> Mat has been testing away, no major snags
[09:16:57] <Wilto> “documentThingsDifferentized.”
[09:17:01] <Wilto> Yeah, so far so good.

[09:20:27] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jblas: Renamed the custom event I added to fix #2348 from "contentmodified" to "updatelayout" so that it reflects more of what it should be used for. Note that this also affects #2042 and the mention of collapsible in #2596.
[09:24:43] <jzaefferer> johnbender: is there some way to peek at that jqm-jenkins-bot instance?
[09:25:08] <johnbender> jzaefferer: not unless you're inside the adobe vpn :(
[09:25:20] <johnbender> jzaefferer: what can I do for you?
[09:25:28] <johnbender> or what are you interested in
[09:25:54] <jzaefferer> just wanted to see what results you get there
[09:26:12] <johnbender> jzaefferer: on failures/success?
[09:26:20] <johnbender> we send out emails if you'd like to be on it
[09:29:12] <jzaefferer> can you just make a screenshot of a job results page?
[09:29:44] <johnbender> jzaefferer: sho can
[09:31:39] <jzaefferer> cool
[09:33:29] <johnbender> jzaefferer: so there's a couple sub pages
[09:33:34] <johnbender> one for each agent

[09:38:12] <jzaefferer> johnbender: thanks, that's useful
[09:38:22] <jzaefferer> could you document that setup a bit?
[09:38:34] <johnbender> jzaefferer: the ci setup?
[09:38:37] <jzaefferer> yeah
[09:38:41] <johnbender> of course!
[09:38:45] <johnbender> hmm
[09:39:08] <johnbender> maybe I'll write something up for you by the end of the day in the form of a readme
[09:39:13] <johnbender> I have it in a branch in my fork of jqm
[09:41:14] <jzaefferer> using selenium, right?
[09:41:20] <johnbender> yessir
[09:41:25] <jzaefferer> with Chrome?
[09:41:31] <johnbender> and firefox
[09:41:32] <johnbender> yah
[09:41:43] <jzaefferer> cool, could use that elsewhere

[10:01:33] <johnbender> danheberden: sorry to hound you that one is just really bad/ugly and I want to make sure it's the same thing
[10:01:48] <johnbender> and you're close at hand :P
[10:03:32] <toddparker> hey guys - anything else you want to land for RC2?
[10:03:55] <toddparker> johnbender, kinblas, gseguin  ^^
[10:04:01] <gseguin> nothing here
[10:04:02] <toddparker> smoke 'em if you got 'em
[10:04:24] <johnbender> toddparker: that checkbox radio
[10:04:29] <johnbender> change
[10:04:30] <johnbender> I posted about
[10:04:32] <gseguin> sorry been busy catching up with Jive tasks after my PTO
[10:04:33] <johnbender> one
[10:04:33] <johnbender> word
[10:04:35] <johnbender> per
[10:04:36] <toddparker> danheberden just told me that he's going to get the git sync setup for ThemeRoller tonight. Woo hoo!
[10:04:38] <johnbender> message
[10:04:47] <gseguin> will be back 100% tomorrow and Fri
[10:04:52] <toddparker> johnbender: that gist?
[10:04:55] <johnbender> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1335
[10:04:55] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1335 on jquery-mobile, reported by anttears (6m, 2w ago): Label clicks not firing event on associated radio buttons
[10:04:57] <johnbender> yah
[10:04:58] <toddparker> cool gseguin
[10:05:03] <johnbender> toddparker: I guess it can wait
[10:05:21] <toddparker> I'm not technical enough to really weigh in
[10:05:27] <johnbender> what I really should do is get some more coverage on the checkboxradio lib
[10:05:33] <johnbender> kinblas:
[10:05:36] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm updating the methods.html file for the toolbars hide/show
[10:05:42] <toddparker> cool kinblas
[10:06:13] <toddparker> i have to leave for a meeting at 3:30 so i'm trying to get this wrapped up early enough to do the website logistics stuff
[10:06:29] <johnbender> toddparker: all my stuff can wait then
[10:07:44] <toddparker> johnbender: on the check/radio
[10:07:59] <toddparker> are you just triggering a click on the label or the input?
[10:08:15] <kinblas> johnbender: did you ping?
[10:08:16] <johnbender> toddparker: the input
[10:08:21] <toddparker> ah, ok
[10:08:28] <johnbender> kinblas: yes
[10:08:43] <johnbender> nothing urgent though
[10:08:51] <toddparker> because clicking the label doesn't work right in iOS from what I can see. labels don't flip the check/radio if they are native
[10:09:07] <kinblas> johnbender: oh ok, I need to finish up the docs before toddparker tags the tree
[10:09:11] <kinblas> is it 1pm already?
[10:09:13] <kinblas> grrr
[10:09:41] <toddparker> it is
[10:09:44] <toddparker> no worries kin
[10:09:55] <toddparker> i'm not a hardass :)
[10:10:17] <toddparker> in fact, shouldn't we be making some super ambitious and risky change RIGHT NOW?
[10:10:25] <kinblas> lol
[10:10:47] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm going to make a branch for header/footer changes that watch focus/blur for those virtual keyboard problems
[10:10:52] <toddparker> johnbender: I think that that check radio change seems a little scary to land right this sec…what do you think kinblas
[10:10:55] <kinblas> I'll need help testing that
[10:11:11] <toddparker> ok, just let mat or i know when you need testing help
[10:11:57] <kinblas> toddparker: heh, I'm always nervous when a fix lands minutes before tagging
[10:12:13] <johnbender> toddparker: that's what I'm saying
[10:12:15] <johnbender> lets wait
[10:12:19] <johnbender> although
[10:12:27] <johnbender> its the kind of thing we'd want to have people play with
[10:12:34] <johnbender> and the tests are green
[10:12:46] <johnbender> so if we decide to cut a 1.0 that will be hanging
[10:12:57] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah but do the tests cover something that change would affect
[10:12:57] <johnbender> after rc2 that is
[10:13:06] <johnbender> kinblas: for the most part I think they do
[10:13:25] <johnbender> the checked states and the ui state
[10:13:47] <toddparker> we could land this tomorrow after testing a bit more and see if people run into issues
[10:14:15] <toddparker> just fyi…i created a new 1.0 Final milestone in the tracker and moved all the remaining RC2 over to that
[10:14:16] <kinblas> johnbender: so just curious, they said it used to work ... what did we do before?
[10:14:20] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=open&page=1&milestone=10
[10:14:49] <johnbender> kinblas: I did a bit of work with git log -p and I think it was the return false addition
[10:15:10] <toddparker> oh, hey johnbender - will the build script now produce a jquery.mobile.structure.css file?
[10:15:24] <johnbender> toddparker: yes
[10:15:30] <toddparker> is that the right name?
[10:15:48] <johnbender> kinblas: that prevented the event from reaching the browser's event handling and setting the check
[10:15:58] <johnbender> kinblas: but we need to to allow for embedding
[10:16:29] <johnbender> this was the discussion we had yesterday about using our markup to "change" the way the browser handles labels for inputs
[10:16:39] <toddparker> rather, this johnbender - http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0rc2/jquery.mobile.structure-1.0rc2.min.css
[10:17:03] <toddparker> that is the same syntax but with .structure added before the version

[10:18:39] <johnbender> toddparker: yah
[10:21:48] <johnbender> toddparker: actually sorry
[10:22:12] <johnbender> toddparker: the files will be jquery.mobile.structure-1.0rc2.min.css
[10:22:15] <johnbender> argh
[10:22:34] <johnbender> jquery.mobile-1.0rc2.structure.min.css
[10:22:50] <johnbender> toddparker: though I'm not clear on if those are being pushed to the cdn or not
[10:23:50] <toddparker> hmm, ok
[10:23:53] <Wilto> I’m pretty much useless at this point, so I’ll just be sitting here hammering out a drumroll on my desk.
[10:24:06] <toddparker> so maybe i'll wait on the blog post for the actual files
[10:24:54] <johnbender> toddparker: is that naming convention ok? I though the namespacing ordering in the front was mean for pre-processing where as the .min .structure etc would be for post processing
[10:25:07] <johnbender> eg concatenation based on grouping
[10:25:19] <johnbender> happy to change that if it's not what you want
[10:26:40] <toddparker> i dunno what's best
[10:26:52] <johnbender> probably fine for now then eh?
[10:27:03] <johnbender> unless there's a convention elsewhere we should follow. ui maybe?
[10:27:06] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[10:27:19] <toddparker> they don't break css out like this unfortunately
[10:27:33] <eddiemonge> whats the question?
[10:27:50] <toddparker> i guess i was thinking that the structure was part of the name, then you have version, then compressed/uncompressed
[10:27:55] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I prepended structure. to min. in the output file name
[10:28:13] <toddparker> we're wondering if that should be before the version in the filename
[10:28:27] <toddparker> and whether this will go up on the CDN or if you need to do something for that
[10:28:32] <eddiemonge> i think it should be
[10:28:39] <toddparker> which Q?
[10:28:42] <eddiemonge> and yes its added to the cdn
[10:29:19] <eddiemonge> jquery.mobile.structure-1.0rc2pre.css
[10:29:27] <eddiemonge> jquery.mobile.structure-1.0rc2pre.min.css
[10:29:37] <toddparker> ok, that's what i was thinking
[10:29:43] <johnbender> so what's the reasoning for min being on the backend then?
[10:29:44] <toddparker> johnbender: can you make that tweak?
[10:29:56] <johnbender> toddparker: and yes
[10:30:00] <johnbender> I'll do that now
[10:30:15] <toddparker> what it is + version + compression + extension
[10:30:30] <toddparker> is sort of the convention, right?
[10:30:54] <eddiemonge> right. thats how it is in core
[10:31:01] <toddparker> kinblas: how goes that doc page addition for the fixed headers?
[10:31:10] <toddparker> ok, cool eddiemonge
[10:31:41] <kinblas> toddparker: about done
[10:31:43] <kinblas> spellchecking
[10:31:48] <kinblas> :-)
[10:31:49] <eddiemonge> although ui does /version/name + compression + ext
[10:32:02] <eddiemonge> johnbender: want me to make those changes real quick?
[10:32:27] <johnbender> eddiemonge: one it
[10:32:32] <johnbender> eddiemonge: on it already
[10:33:47] <toddparker> ui leads with version?
[10:33:57] <eddiemonge> in separate folderes
[10:34:02] <toddparker> oh well, we have our own convention apparently
[10:34:25] <toddparker> ah, because they have multiple versions
[10:34:29] <toddparker> we'll be there soon
[10:37:45] <eddiemonge> johnbender: slightly related: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2751

[10:58:36] <kinblas> I haven't done that ...
[10:58:39] <toddparker> can you remind me how to tell the bars to re-position?
[10:58:47] <toddparker> i'll handle it, no problem
[10:59:13] <kinblas> toddparker: there is a code sample in the methods.html
[10:59:18] <kinblas> hang on let me copy/paste
[10:59:44] <eddiemonge> yup looks good
[11:00:09] <kinblas> toddparker: $.mobile.fixedToolbars.show();	
[11:00:18] <kinblas> will cause it to reposition but with a fade
[11:00:25] <kinblas> if you want it to happen immediately
[11:00:27] <kinblas> pass a true
[11:00:30] <kinblas> $.mobile.fixedToolbars.show(true);	
[11:02:45] <kinblas> toddparker: it's kind of lame that we can't link directly to the spot within the documentation where something is
[11:03:29] <toddparker> cool
[11:03:34] <johnbender> eddiemonge: thanks man
[11:05:04] <eddiemonge> toddparker: side question: why is there an ant build in addition to make?
[11:05:33] <johnbender> gseguin: toddparker: kinblas: eddiemonge: http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/
[11:05:41] <johnbender> every single commit today
[11:05:52] <johnbender> will have an emoji
[11:06:08] <gseguin> :)
[11:06:31] <johnbender> can't decide between the sparkles or the rainbow (since I graduated from U of H)
[11:06:48] <johnbender> though I'm not particularly fond of my education :(
[11:09:17] <eddiemonge> johnbender: oh geez https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/0c05501b0d3ddb66b8473b2f437f0d9c8af5f156/combine.php
[11:10:31] <kinblas> johnbender: so what's the deal with those? If you just type the text for one of those things ilke :+1: it actually renders it in the comments?
[11:11:19] <toddparker> kin - i added this to the fixed page
[11:11:20] <toddparker> If the height of the page changes, either through dynamic injection of markup, or by widgets that hide or collapse content, it can throw off the dynamic positioning of the toolbars. To manually tell the toolbars to re-position themselves then fade in, use $.mobile.fixedToolbars.show();. To have them appear immediately without the fade, use $.mobile.fixedToolbars.show(true);.
[11:11:20] <toddparker> There is also a updatelayout event that can be used to trigger the toolbars to re-position. Developers who are building dynamic applications that inject content into the current page can also manually trigger this updatelayout event to ensure components on the page update in response to the new content that was just added. This event is used internally in the collapsible and listview filter plugins.
[11:11:45] <toddparker> I link to the event page in the 2nd pp
[11:12:09] <kinblas> sounds good
[11:12:32] <kinblas> toddparker: just an fyi ... the updatelayout event is a good idea if you don't want your code to care specifically about headers/footers
[11:12:43] <toddparker> true
[11:13:00] <kinblas> but the header/footers always use fade-in in response to that event
[11:13:47] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ?
[11:13:50] <johnbender> I'm confused
[11:13:55] <eddiemonge> toddparker: i think we can drop the build.xml file. going through its history, the original reason it was added is no longer valid
[11:14:19] <johnbender> eddiemonge: we've got an issue logged to centralize the list
[11:14:20] <eddiemonge> before, there was some php craziness going on but its now been simplified
[11:14:29] <johnbender> for the combine php and the makefile
[11:14:56] <johnbender> kinblas: yes and in commit messages :D
[11:15:23] <eddiemonge> johnbender: you have a ticker number?
[11:15:32] <kinblas> johnbender: oh boy, I need to be creative with my next checkin so it uses as many of those as possible.
[11:15:44] <toddparker> ok, all my changes are in
[11:15:57] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I don't :(
[11:16:06] <toddparker> so what's the deal with all the build files?
[11:16:17] <toddparker> do i need to wait on that or can we lock and load
[11:16:24] <eddiemonge> lock and load
[11:16:27] <eddiemonge> and fire
[11:16:31] <johnbender> kinblas: :sunflower: :fire: :leaves: :fish: :heart: :captainplanet: :D
[11:16:38] <eddiemonge> this is a side issue that can be resolved later
[11:17:38] <toddparker> ok. email mr. resig
[11:18:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #152: SUCCESS in 10 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/152/
[11:18:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Adds a little breathing room above dialogs at wider screen sizes.
[11:18:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: cleaned up test to limit event binding bleed
[11:18:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * eddie: Add a structure output to the ant build
[11:18:21] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Added documentation for $.mobile.fixedToolbars.show/hide functions.
[11:18:21] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: move .structure before version in css build put filenames :sparkles:
[11:18:22] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Updated files for RC2
[11:18:52] <eddiemonge> johnbender: i think that unless we want to greatly expand the ant build, maintaining two 'build' files is a waste
[11:19:11] <johnbender> eddiemonge: well we have the makefile and the combine.php right?
[11:19:23] <johnbender> unles I'm much mistaken
[11:19:59] <johnbender> it's been a while since I looked at the php
[11:20:47] <eddiemonge> johnbender: right. the makefile does everything the ant build does and more.
[11:21:09] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah I'm all for dumping the ant build
[11:21:30] <johnbender> sorry I thought you were saying that we could close that issue with the ant build file removal
[11:21:48] <johnbender> eddiemonge: you are correct sir, THROW IT OUT!
[11:22:00] <eddiemonge> i could go through and make the ant build as robust as the makefile, but would rather not unless theres a specific reason to
[11:23:06] <johnbender> I thought it odd from day one tbh
[11:23:22] <johnbender> someone will complain I'm sure (windows devs?)
[11:23:30] <eddiemonge> i could see it being useful in some automated builds but i dont think thats happening
[11:23:49] <eddiemonge> isnt it just as easy/hard for them to install make as it is ant?
[11:24:12] <johnbender> I have no idea what make looks like on windows
[11:24:35] <eddiemonge> i have no idea what ant looks like on windows
[11:24:40] <johnbender> lol
[11:24:43] <johnbender> fair enough
[11:24:54] <johnbender> since that makes two of us
[11:25:43] <johnbender> eddiemonge: the original commiter was schalk@ossreleasefeed.com
[11:26:03] <johnbender> or was that what you linked earlier
[11:26:05] <eddiemonge> i dont know who that is either
[11:26:09] <eddiemonge> it is what i linked
[11:26:15] <johnbender> yerp
[11:26:57] <eddiemonge> why does it seem like i have to click all the button-like button twice in github?

[11:30:42] <eddiemonge> open for discussion
[11:31:39] <eddiemonge> oh, this guy too: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2747/files
[11:31:39] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (15h, 10m ago): Update to include instructions on how to build using a custom theme.
[11:49:23] <toddparker> johnbender: i'll let you review and pull those in if they look good
[11:49:34] <toddparker> we we're all set, just waiting for john now!
[12:02:29] <toddparker> eddie
[12:02:33] <toddparker> eddiemonge: question
[12:02:54] <toddparker> do we have a want o simply point to "latest stable" versions of css and js?
[12:03:12] <toddparker> kind of like the latest, but "stable"
[12:03:47] <toddparker> now, /demos/ points to latest stable so if the CDN version of the JS and CSS had a similar thing, that could be cool
[12:15:52] <johnbender> toddparker: yah I saw that in my notifications
[12:16:02] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I'm going to merge and then deal with the conflict on the ci
[12:20:17] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #153: SUCCESS in 12 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/153/
[12:20:17] <jqm-jenkins-bot> todd: Added a blurb about toolbar events for re-positioning
[12:22:35] <ajpiano> what's the backend of the new mobile themeroller written in?
[12:23:14] <toddparker> perl
[12:23:17] <toddparker> kidding
[12:23:34] <toddparker> there's just a few php scripts for importing and downloading themes
[12:23:37] <Wilto> NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, SONTAG
[12:23:41] <toddparker> the rest is client side
[12:23:51] <toddparker> yeah what Wilto said
[12:23:54] <ajpiano> i have a guy who's interested in helping out on PHP stuff
[12:24:03] <toddparker> cool
[12:24:04] <Wilto> Oh. Your business then, Sontag.
[12:24:05] <johnbender> toddparker: do we want to include the build xml removal in the rc2 tag?
[12:24:09] <toddparker> is he an infra guy?
[12:24:15] <ajpiano> toddparker: do we have any idea yet of how transportable the new themeroller is to jquery ui?
[12:24:16] <johnbender> toddparker: or should we tell John to just tag the commit before
[12:24:19] <johnbender> your blurb
[12:24:26] <johnbender> It doesn't much matter
[12:24:39] <toddparker> why tag before that blurb?
[12:24:40] <johnbender> just wondering if you had your heart set on being the last commit or something
[12:24:42] <ajpiano> toddparker: yeah, he introduced himself to me at the conf, said his strengths were in php and i knew TR might be the place for him
[12:24:45] <toddparker> heh
[12:24:46] <toddparker> no
[12:24:48] <johnbender> toddparker: tag the blurb before it
[12:24:52] <johnbender> err
[12:24:55] <johnbender> he commit after it
[12:24:56] <johnbender> good lord
[12:24:59] <johnbender> I'm confusing myself
[12:25:15] <Wilto> I’m gonna make a whitespace commit to trump everyone, at the last possible second.
[12:25:24] <toddparker> me too
[12:25:31] <Wilto> IT’S ON
[12:25:35] <toddparker> so this is the xml removal
[12:26:19] <johnbender> toddparker: yah
[12:26:26] <toddparker> i dunno
[12:26:32] <toddparker> is that a big deal?
[12:26:47] <johnbender> the only thing I could think of was windows devs who want to build with java and not install make
[12:26:48] <ajpiano> toddparker: is there anything you want/need help with as far as that side is concerned?
[12:26:54] <toddparker> if you're not comfortable, we can tell john to avoid it
[12:27:11] <toddparker> i think once this is up on the server, there might be some tasks ajpiano
[12:27:12] <johnbender> toddparker: no its fine
[12:27:21] <toddparker> which will hopefully be tomorrow, right danheberden
[12:27:22] <johnbender> windows devs will just have to survive without doing builds
[12:27:23] <toddparker> heh
[12:27:32] <johnbender> unless they install cygwin
[12:27:32] <danheberden> toddparker ya
[12:27:37] <toddparker> that doesn't seem great
[12:27:43] <toddparker> johnbender:
[12:28:06] <toddparker> i gotta head out
[12:28:19] <johnbender> toddparker: that wasn't the original purpose mind you accordign to eddiemonge's research
[12:28:25] <johnbender> toddparker: alright we can continue this when you get back on
[12:28:25] <toddparker> Wilto is going to press all the buttons once this goes thru
[12:28:52] <Wilto> I may install a huge sparking knife-switch on the wall, a la Frankenstein.
[12:28:52] <toddparker> if you have a commit you want to exclude, can you hit me here with it?
[12:29:27] <johnbender> toddparker: I think it's fine
[12:29:31] <johnbender> let's roll with what we have
[12:30:49] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #154: FAILURE in 6.7 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/154/
[12:30:49] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * eddie: Update to include instructions on how to build using a custom theme.
[12:30:50] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * eddie: Update README.md
[12:30:50] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * eddie: Update README.md
[12:30:51] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * eddie: Remove build.xml as it is not as feature rich as the makefile and having two build scripts is redundant
[12:30:58] <johnbender> thats the readme change
[12:32:15] <johnbender> rebuilding now
[12:32:54] <toddparker> ok
[12:32:59] <toddparker> heading to a meeting!
[12:33:07] <toddparker> talk to you later
[12:36:46] <Wilto> Oh yeah no big just leave the new guy to hit all the launch buttons THANKS TODD.
[12:37:24] <johnbender> missle codez
[12:37:36] <johnbender> missile*
[12:38:05] <Wilto> My luck, I’ll screw it up so badly that I’ll accidentally launch a new version of Sencha.
[12:38:15] <johnbender> lol
[12:42:30] <eddiemonge> back from lunch.
[12:42:37] <eddiemonge> whatd i miss?
[12:42:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[12:42:56] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #155: FIXED in 10 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/155/
[12:43:44] <Wilto> eddiemonge: I’m about to break the entire project forever, is the main idea.
[12:44:49] <eddiemonge> oh. cool. ive done that a few times
[12:45:18] <eddiemonge> well maybe it was only temporary
[13:29:22] <Wilto> So uh… Hm.
[13:29:32] <johnbender> Wilto: ??
[13:29:51] <Wilto> Still no green-light from Resig.
[13:30:30] <johnbender> Wilto: not a big deal is it?
[13:30:47] <Wilto> Nah. I’m just an impatient dude.
[13:30:54] <kinblas> heh
[13:31:02] <kinblas> johnbender: wilto has his finger on the button
[13:31:07] <kinblas> he's had it there for the past hour or so
[13:31:17] <kinblas> :-)
[13:32:34] <Wilto> Current Status: http://wil.to/_/button.gif
[13:35:14] <johnbender> Wilto: I was wondering if you'd be able to come up with an image for that
[13:35:17] <johnbender> well done
[13:35:19] <Wilto> Always.
[13:38:08] <gseguin> :)
[13:50:21] <eddiemonge> button pushing time!
[13:50:23] <eddiemonge> well almost
[13:50:43] <eddiemonge> ok maybe it is time
[13:52:36] <eddiemonge> Wilto: ping
[13:52:54] <Wilto> Yo yo.
[13:53:12] <Wilto> Oh, is everything up? I was waiting for Resig to give the go-ahead.
[13:54:45] <johnbender> last email said he was going to "get this up now"
[13:55:08] <gseguin> it seems like it's up
[13:55:19] <eddiemonge> github is updated
[13:55:21] <kinblas> eddiemonge: I forget, was you that updates the code.jquery.com index?
[13:55:36] <eddiemonge> kinblas: yeah but i cant get to it until tonight
[13:55:58] <gseguin> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0rc2/jquery.mobile-1.0rc2.js
[13:56:15] <kinblas> eddiemonge: that's cool, as long as it gets updated
[13:56:54] <gseguin> hit it Wilto
[13:57:04] <kinblas> Wilto: do you know if todd updated the banners to say RC2?
[13:57:52] <eddiemonge> it is
[13:58:04] <eddiemonge> or do you mean in the docs?
[13:58:12] <Wilto> He mentioned it, so I assume…
[13:58:16] <eddiemonge> nevermind, updated there too
[13:58:39] <kinblas> yeah I meant the docs
[13:58:57] <kinblas> and the front page of jquerymobile.com
[13:59:13] <johnbender> Wilto: can you tell me when you've pushed the blog post?
[13:59:18] <johnbender> or is that not part of this
[13:59:26] <Wilto> It should be up.
[13:59:34] <Wilto> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/10/19/jquery-mobile-1-0rc2-released/
[13:59:36] <Wilto> ?
[13:59:50] <gseguin> yup it's up
[14:00:43] <eddiemonge> hmm it needs editing. the links section should have links for the structure css files as well
[14:02:27] <Wilto> Whereabouts?
[14:04:11] <eddiemonge> updated the category for it too
[14:06:23] <Wilto> eddiemonge: You’re saying that we’re offering the structure CSS separately via the CDN? Sorry, I’m a little out-of-the-loop on this stuff.
[14:06:50] <eddiemonge> yup. and the post is updated now too
[14:06:53] <Wilto> If updates to the blog post are needed, just point me in the right direction.
[14:06:56] <Wilto> Oh, cool.
[14:10:44] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2190
[14:10:45] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2190 on jquery-mobile, reported by josh-h (2m, 2w ago): Unable to close dialog within a UIWebView on iOS
[14:10:46] <johnbender> digging into that one
[14:11:38] <johnbender> kinblas: unless you're focusing on it
[14:14:01] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah I haven't touched that cause I saw your previous comment
[14:18:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #156: SUCCESS in 10 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/156/
[14:18:20] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jeresig: Releasing 1.0rc2.
[14:19:18] <johnbender> kinblas: I've found that phonegap works but I'm under the impression it's because it ... monkey patches window.history.back ...
[14:19:56] <kinblas> johnbender: right the interesting thing about a webview is that you have to implement the browser hooks
[14:20:14] <kinblas> so I'm not so sure a generic webview provides everything we require or expect
[14:21:51] <johnbender> thats what I'm thinking but I'm trying to find docs that support it so we can provide them and close the issue
[14:28:46] <johnbender> kinblas: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIWebView_Class/Reference/Reference.html
[14:29:18] <johnbender> oddly it says there that you should set canGoBack and canGoForward to enable those but the property docs name them readonly
[14:30:36] <johnbender> ahh
[14:30:41] <johnbender> its just poorley worded
[14:30:41] <kinblas> you implement that
[14:31:01] <johnbender> it's saying use those properties to disable your own forward and backward buttons
[14:31:12] <kinblas> oh heh
[14:31:23] <johnbender> it sort of suggests that window.history.back wont work but it's not very clear
[14:31:26] <johnbender> ugh!
[14:31:30] <johnbender> and I can't find anything on the internets
[14:31:39] <johnbender> hmm
[14:31:41] <johnbender> one sec
[14:33:11] <johnbender> kinblas: and it works as long as you dump a page with a meta refresh redirect in front of it
[14:33:18] <johnbender> sigh
[14:33:46] <kinblas> johnbender: not sure what you mean?
[14:34:07] <johnbender> kinblas: back works
[14:34:13] <johnbender> just not in this case :(
[14:34:22] <johnbender> in the case described in the bug
[14:34:33] <johnbender> kinblas: I'll let you know what I find
[14:35:01] <kinblas> johnbender: I meant to ask how you are testing this?
[14:35:13] <kinblas> You are able to build it and then deploy it into the simulator?
[14:36:00] <johnbender> yah
[15:02:58] <kinblas> johnbender: thanks for the correction, I'm  a bonehead
[15:03:04] <kinblas> I have way toooo many windows open
[15:04:44] <johnbender> kinblas: lol I'm the king of "here's what I meant when i sent/said that"
[15:05:08] <johnbender> I think I've only every gotten a github comment right the first time but once or twice
[15:05:19] <kinblas> heh
[15:16:51] <kinblas> johnbender: lol, I still got the URL wrong in my bonehead email ... what a goof
[15:26:41] <johnbender> toddparker: kinblas: do we know anyone on the phonegap team I could ask about this uiwebview issue
[15:27:00] <johnbender> I'm almost 100% sure it isn't our problem but we should sort out what to tell people when they come to us
[15:33:24] <kinblas> you can try @davejohnson or @brianleroux
[15:33:35] <johnbender> kinblas: twitter? or irc?
[15:33:39] <kinblas> twitter
[15:34:00] <kinblas> johnbender: they are still external so no adobe addresses yet
[15:34:36] <kinblas> johnbender: if you hang on I can check to see if I have their nitobi addresses
[15:36:08] <kinblas> johnbender: I pm'd them to you
[15:45:35] <johnbender> kinblas: yah thanks
