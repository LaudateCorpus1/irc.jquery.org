[06:03:34] <AnaRita> can someone help me with jquery-localize: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10260342/using-jquery-localize-for-bilingual-shopify-store
[07:10:33] <Wilto> Present.
[07:49:14] <deAtog> toddparker: what do you think about incorporating this into jQM? https://github.com/balupton/History.js/
[08:56:42] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:16:35] <Wilto> Whatup, gseguin.
[09:17:15] <gseguin> hey Wilto: the builder seems broken, I'm looking into it
[09:22:22] <Wilto> Cool, cool. Anything I can do, or is it server-y stuff?
[09:22:53] <gseguin> I think it's a failure in the ui's logic I'm not quite sure yet
[09:22:58] <gseguin> I'll take care of it
[09:23:12] <Wilto> Thanks, dude!
[09:23:29] <gseguin> there is also an issue that someone raised that the produced bundle is bigger than the kitchen sink one
[09:23:41] <gseguin> which I haven't verified
[09:23:47] <gseguin> but seems weird
[09:24:07] <Wilto> Thatâ€¦ is bizarre, if true.
[09:24:31] <Wilto> I did include my gif library in the builder but that is probably okay right Y/N_
[09:46:07] <gseguin> lol

[11:44:46] <Wilto> HIGH-FIVE, _|Nix|_
[11:44:56] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Wha ... ?
[11:45:03] <gseguin> ?hi5 _|Nix|_
[11:45:06] <bot-t> gseguin, Couldn't find "hi5 _|Nix|_" in jQuery Docs.
[11:45:09] <Wilto> oh nothing check your email though
[11:45:20] <gseguin> oh man bot-t you suck
[11:45:47] <Wilto> I hate that robot.
[11:46:12] <_|Nix|_> Cool!
[11:46:52] <_|Nix|_> Wow! This is achievement day ... I got my Finnish citizenship today as well :)
[11:47:20] <_|Nix|_> ... and my daughter's godfather got a job interview at my company which went really well.
[11:47:21] <Wilto> We made that happen to. We know a guy. Hush-hush.
[11:47:27] <Wilto> s/to/too
[11:47:34] <gseguin> :)
[11:48:10] <_|Nix|_> ... and my daughter ran around the mall for the first time in her life ...
[11:48:23] <_|Nix|_> Doubt you guys did that ;)
[11:48:36] <Wilto> Damn, man.
[11:49:06] <_|Nix|_> OK ... so ... lessee ... about that popup widget ...
[11:50:24] <_|Nix|_> I've been writing some unit tests for it, and I realized that I need a helper that's more capable than eventCascade, because it's not enough to listen to just one event, but several, and from several sources ...
[11:50:49] <gseguin> yeah I saw that PR
[11:50:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Even more than that.
[11:51:20] <gseguin> if it doesn't break the rest of the tests (which I assume it doesn't)
[11:51:43] <gseguin> you can probably land that and merge it up to the popup-widget branch
[11:52:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I realized after that PR, that I need more. I need this: [ fn(result), [ { source: jQuery object, event: string }, ... ]
[11:52:05] <_|Nix|_> ... ]
[11:52:26] <_|Nix|_> where result is [ { source: jQuery object, event: string, timedOut: boolean }, ... ]
[11:52:38] <gseguin> wanna add a wrapper instead of changing the signature?
[11:53:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Actually, this would be an underlying function called by eventCascade ...
[11:53:01] <gseguin> s/wrapper/helper/
[11:53:32] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: But I can write it only for popup, and when it works well, we can start to build on it.
[11:53:53] <gseguin> that sounds like a good idea
[11:53:57] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: BTW: Once I had mutually exclusive popups working, doing a stack proved very simple.
[11:54:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Just a matter of linking the popups into a linked list.
[11:54:35] <gseguin> oh good so it was a good exercise then
[11:54:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The first popup handles all the navigation, and when there's a hashchange, pop pop pop pop pop the whole list.
[11:54:56] <gseguin> we can see if we get a lot of demand for multiple popups and act then
[11:55:03] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah ... no need for grandiose plans like popupStack.
[11:55:09] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[11:55:34] <_|Nix|_> I also made it so you can write a popup subclass that overrides three methods inside popup, resulting in a popup stack.
[11:56:18] <_|Nix|_> So, the whole navigation code is generically useful for popups no matter how you decide to do popups.
[11:56:45] <gseguin> is that all in the popup-widget branch?
[11:57:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: It will be, now that I have push privileges ...
[11:57:18] <gseguin> I'm working on the builder right now but hopefully I will have time to look at it
[11:57:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK.
[11:57:40] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Do you want me to push this stuff?
[11:57:54] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll continue the work on the popup-widget branch.
[11:58:33] <gseguin> yeah the popup-widget branch is all yours
[11:58:51] <gseguin> you can push all you want in it
[11:59:09] <gseguin> lets just make sure we get a few reviewers before landing it
[11:59:32] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: ^
[11:59:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Certainly.
[12:00:20] <gseguin> Congrats and thank you for your hard work

[12:03:33] <_|Nix|_> Whoops ... my first mistake, too ... I pushed the stack management as well ... can I push the head back by one commit?
[12:03:58] <gseguin> that would require a force update

[12:04:18] <_|Nix|_> OK ... so I'll revert ...

[15:33:43] <toddparker> gseguin: what kind of config change?
[15:33:53] <gseguin> adding a ProxyPass
[15:34:14] <gseguin> so we can hit /amd-builder and it'll proxy to http://amd-builder.no.de
[15:34:20] <toddparker> i see
[15:34:23] <gseguin> that'll fix Opera and IE
[15:34:28] <toddparker> gotcha
[15:34:39] <gseguin> I made it work on my local apache
[15:34:48] <toddparker> I'd just ask danheberden and/or johnbender
[15:34:58] <gseguin> but I don't know how that plays with virtual hosts
[15:35:01] <toddparker> seems like it wouldn't cause issues

[15:43:34] <toddparker> thanks!
[15:50:20] <gseguin> toddparker: it works!
[15:52:17] <gseguin> on IE and Opera as well
[15:55:59] <johnbender> gseguin: danheberden was planning to do something similar for our latest / branches preview setups so I think that's probably fine

[17:43:18] <gseguin> as we go
[17:43:19] <gseguin> ?
[17:43:37] <gseguin> or as a batch right before 1.1.1?

[21:01:36] <johnbender> gseguin: well, I'd like to do them at the time of the commit
[21:01:39] <johnbender> seems silly to wait
