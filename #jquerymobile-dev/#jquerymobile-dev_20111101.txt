[00:19:42] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jblas: Some code optimizations to speed up page enhancement.
[03:49:38] <_|Nix|_> Hi! Is there any way to get what theme a given element has? I mean, is there some utility for that. I can obviously travel up the hierarchy and look for /ui-body-[a-z]/, but maybe that's already part of jqm.
[03:55:11] <aaronmcadam> that's what some internals do
[03:55:28] <aaronmcadam> using :jqmData
[03:57:41] <aaronmcadam> _|Nix|_: $this.jqmData( "theme" ),
[07:25:54] <_|Nix|_> aaronmcadam: Thanks!
[07:47:08] <_|Nix|_> Is there some canonical way of converting a string to a boolean? I don't want to reinvent the wheel ...

[08:44:10] <kinblas> toddparker_: hey
[08:47:11] <toddmparker_> how goes
[08:47:25] <toddmparker_> is that little fix above ok to pull in?
[08:54:09] <toddmparker_> kinblas: nice optimizations yesterday
[08:54:25] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm still working on a few others
[08:54:34] <toddmparker_> yeah? great
[08:54:41] <kinblas> I just checked in the buttonMarkup lastnight
[08:54:49] <kinblas> since it seemed to make a difference
[08:54:58] <toddmparker_> definitely email me with a final list of tweaks and the performance improvements
[08:55:04] <kinblas> will do

[09:30:40] <kinblas> toddmparker_: let me compare numbers against rc2
[09:30:46] <toddmparker_> k
[09:31:23] <kinblas> The optimizations I've checked in so far have reduced our enhancement of the 400 item listview by a few thousand calls :-)
[09:32:20] <toddmparker_> wowie
[09:32:37] <toddmparker_> how many secs off enhancment?
[09:33:05] <Wilto> Damn. Awesome news, kinblas.
[09:38:01] <toddmparker_> kinblas: thoughts on whether you or bender should get the first mango device?
[09:38:10] <toddmparker_> johnbender ^^
[09:38:16] <toddmparker_> whoever gets it, fixes stuff
[09:38:19] <toddmparker_> we're taking the other
[09:38:27] <toddmparker_> more should come soon
[09:38:27] <kinblas> heh ... john then? :-)
[09:39:04] <toddmparker_> your choice guys
[09:39:07] <toddmparker_> who wants the pain
[09:39:19] <toddmparker_> Wilto is gonna get it here

[09:47:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas I am here, not sure why I didn't get that alert
[09:47:10] <bot-t> (16 hours 50 mins ago) <jzaefferer> tell johnbender he should've used jslint
[09:47:25] <johnbender> jzaefferer: true
[09:47:30] <johnbender> or use strict
[09:47:32] * jzaefferer winks
[09:47:37] <johnbender> still
[09:47:46] <johnbender> or js2-mode
[09:48:48] <johnbender> kinblas: I'll take it
[09:48:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[09:50:31] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so I just tried loading the 400 listview sample from rc2 and from /test/
[09:50:51] <kinblas> rc2 loads in 3.5 seconds, /test/ loads in 2.5 seconds (on iPad)
[09:51:01] <kinblas> we still have a ways to do
[09:51:03] <kinblas> go
[09:51:06] <johnbender> less bad though eh?
[09:51:25] <kinblas> yeah
[09:51:32] <kinblas> I want to try and get that down to about a second
[09:51:57] <kinblas> btw, half of that improvement was just reducing the number of times we call jqmData()
[09:52:18] <johnbender> kinblas: :(
[09:52:19] <kinblas> *EVERY* time we call that function whether read/write it does a toLowerCase() on the element name to figure out if it supports data
[09:52:57] <johnbender> kinblas: what do you mean "supports data"
[09:54:14] <kinblas> look at the function $.acceptData
[09:54:18] <kinblas> in jquery.js
[09:54:45] <kinblas> there's a list of element names that we don't/can't track data on
[09:55:09] <kinblas> I"m not sure if it's because they don't support expando properties
[09:55:15] <kinblas> or not
[09:56:05] <kinblas> anyways, if we know we have a value for a data attribute specified (because it was given to us) we don't need to look for the attribute, especially, if we are just going to overwrite the lookup with what we were given
[09:56:30] <kinblas> 400 lookups avoided
[09:56:35] <kinblas> :-)
[09:57:43] <johnbender> kinblas: embed, object, and applet
[09:58:11] <johnbender> yah it says they throw exceptions if you try and add expando's apparently
[09:59:11] <johnbender> kinblas: wow it fails silently in that case
[09:59:33] * johnbender thinks to many javascript libraries fail silently
[09:59:37] <johnbender> *too
[10:00:37] <johnbender> throwing exceptions is like cardinal sin or some such
[10:07:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: you guys know I'm off the rest of the week right?
[10:08:03] <johnbender> I know I mentioned it yesterday but I want to double check
[10:08:10] <kinblas> johnbender: nope
[10:08:20] <kinblas> johnbender: starting tomorrow?
[10:08:23] <johnbender> yah

[10:33:07] <kinblas> I have to look at his sample
[10:33:55] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it was hard to debug his sample because he hash a scroll event handler that always resets the scroll position to (0,0) so I can't see the log window
[10:34:21] <toddmparker_> ah
[10:34:22] <kinblas> had to write a bookmarklet to undo his scroll event handler
[10:34:32] <toddmparker_> just say that then. make him give you a clean demo
[10:34:39] <kinblas> I think he did
[10:34:44] <kinblas> I just haven't had the time to look at it

[10:41:29] <toddmparker_> yeah? odd

[10:44:03] <johnbender> bizare
[10:44:05] <johnbender> why did it fail

[10:48:27] <eddiemonge> that forms response page is another reason zipping up the docs as well is not a good idea
[10:48:53] <toddmparker_> people just need to be running php
[10:49:05] <toddmparker_> even for the js and css to work
[10:49:33] <johnbender> :(
[10:49:52] <johnbender> I'd love to be able to dev without needing php
[10:50:20] <toddmparker_> maybe the build script can flatten all that out so they are static
[10:50:27] <johnbender> mind you my apache install is sequestered inside a vm
[10:50:34] <toddmparker_> but the form submit examples need some server language
[10:50:42] <johnbender> right
[10:50:47] <toddmparker_> it's just an example
[10:50:48] <johnbender> and that's fine
[10:50:54] <toddmparker_> yeah, i think so
[10:50:55] <johnbender> we can leave it out of the packaged docs
[10:51:18] <toddmparker_> i'd rather not remove the page
[10:51:37] <toddmparker_> we can just note that php may be needed for a few pages
[10:51:45] <toddmparker_> might only be that one page
[10:52:04] <eddiemonge> is server side really needed?
[10:52:25] <eddiemonge> like that, can we have only one value and submit that so we can "fake" the server side part?
[10:52:30] <toddmparker_> to process a form?
[10:53:02] <toddmparker_> yeah, but that would be pretty lame
[10:53:23] <toddmparker_> we could just add a note to that single page about the fact that we use php
[10:53:48] <eddiemonge> or we could pass it as a get and read that from js
[10:57:54] <toddmparker_> but we're trying to illustrate a PE approach to forms
[10:58:02] <toddmparker_> using JS would muddy the demo
[11:04:08] <eddiemonge> PE approach?

[11:46:47] <toddmparker_> des that mean it's operator error?
[11:58:11] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2877/files
[11:58:44] <eddiemonge> should the hidden input even get removed after submitting? what if its an ajax submit and the page doesnt go away.
[11:58:59] <eddiemonge> would it be better to update the input instead of recreating it?
[11:59:15] <eddiemonge> does adding hidden inputs cause a reflow? what about updating its values?
[11:59:47] <toddmparker_> not sure eddie
[12:00:28] <eddiemonge> ill comment there because its time for lunch
[12:01:22] <Wilto> If they’re handled as display: none; it’ll trigger a reflow in IE.
[12:01:39] <Wilto> I don’t *think* it will anywhere else.
[12:12:14] <toddmparker_> kinblas: do you know if we implemented the overlay-theme option yet?
[12:17:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: onlyt that it's the same bug

[12:17:08] <johnbender> it should work either way
[12:17:27] <toddmparker_> johnbender: not sure what you mean
[12:17:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: well he's seeing a different form of he same issue that I submitted the bug report for
[12:17:51] <johnbender> which incidentally does not exist in 4.0
[12:18:10] <toddmparker_> you talking aout #2066?
[12:18:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yessir
[12:18:30] <johnbender> sorry
[12:18:39] <toddmparker_> ah, ok. was thinking about dialogs
[12:18:53] <toddmparker_> ok so that is still an open issue

[12:29:59] <toddmparker_> we have 2 WP7 devices on the way
[12:40:17] <Wilto> Sweet.
[12:52:05] <toddmparker_> johnbender: on #2066, what do you think we can do to accomodate the form tag around pages?
[12:56:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: well I have the ghetto solution
[12:56:58] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[12:57:13] <johnbender> we add the mobile viewport to the first parent of the first page
[12:57:20] <johnbender> instead
[12:57:34] <johnbender> toddmparker_: $pages.first().parents( ":not(forminst)" ).first().addClass( "ui-mobile-viewport" );
[12:57:41] <johnbender> lol
[12:57:42] <johnbender> forminst
[12:57:46] <johnbender> not sure how that happened
[12:57:58] <johnbender> I think I started typing instead with bad window focus
[12:58:05] <johnbender> $pages.first().parents( ":not(form)" ).first().addClass( "ui-mobile-viewport" );
[12:58:38] <kinblas> toddmparker: I didn't work on it .. .for some reason I thought johnbender was working on it.
[13:00:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it just avoids forms but sort of ignorest the bigger issue
[13:00:29] <johnbender> which is that any block level element that's not the body causes the problem
[13:00:49] <johnbender> on one hand it would be better to special case the form and say "otherwise don't do that"
[13:00:56] <toddmparker_> yeah, but this will fix 80% of the situations where it's a problem
[13:01:01] <johnbender> yah
[13:01:18] <johnbender> on the other hand there may be a legit use case for said parent block level element
[13:01:29] <johnbender> I mean I could make a list of block level elements to skip
[13:01:42] * johnbender is not  going to do that
[13:03:06] <Wilto> (Not it.)
[13:03:29] <toddmparker_> form, div
[13:03:31] <toddmparker_> done
[13:03:49] <toddmparker_> now we're at 99%
[13:04:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm worried that adding in the div will break peoples apps or something
[13:04:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm thinking do the form and wait for someone to complain about the div
[13:05:00] <toddmparker_> k
[13:12:20] <eddiemonge> maybe ill win a windows phone i can test on here at #ngc11
[13:17:21] <eddiemonge> what was the irc link think someone posted a few days ago?
[13:38:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: arg
[13:38:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: this has been discussed in other contexts but nav uses .children on the page container
[13:38:58] <johnbender> which means we can't skip the form
[13:55:30] <toddmparker_> hmm
[13:55:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I have a workaround that seems to work fine for me
[13:55:47] <toddmparker_> yeah? awesome
[13:55:49] <johnbender> but I'm not comfortable puting it in the library
[13:55:53] <toddmparker_> heh
[13:56:03] <johnbender> it just moves the the viewport class up one levela
[13:56:09] <johnbender> which assumes it's the body
[13:56:31] <Wilto> Hi guys. Heard johnbender was breaking the library—figured I’d stop in and see what he was up to.
[13:56:37] <toddmparker_> would that work with touchOverflow
[13:56:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: thats the problem
[13:56:47] <johnbender> I really don't know
[13:57:06] <johnbender> which is why I'm not comfortable adding it the library
[13:57:24] <johnbender> it doesn't apear that anything cares about the class itself
[13:57:33] <johnbender> only the $.mobile.pageContainer
[13:58:02] <johnbender> which will be the form in this case but that doesn't prevent everything from working unless that misbehaves with touch overlow
[13:58:10] <johnbender> or other
[13:58:18] <johnbender> that part I'm far from clear on
[13:58:27] <johnbender> it does seem odd to leave that as the pageContainer
[13:58:32] <johnbender> but we don't have a choice otherwise
[13:58:39] <johnbender> the whole nav library uses children
[13:59:41] <toddmparker_> fun
[14:00:10] <toddmparker_> hey kinblas or gseguin, any thoughts in this
[14:00:53] <johnbender> we could ask the folks with the bug to test the workaround for us
[14:00:55] <johnbender> again
[14:01:03] <johnbender> not going to add this to a library now or ever
[14:01:09] <toddmparker_> ha
[14:01:26] <johnbender> we need to address what the expectation is for the page container and enforce it on some level
[14:01:31] <toddmparker_> so is this just something we first ask the issue folks to test
[14:01:32] <johnbender> right now it's just whatever is the page parent
[14:01:38] <toddmparker_> if it works, we add it to the docs
[14:01:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that's one possible step
[14:01:59] <johnbender> it just feels like there are a ton of ways this could break
[14:02:03] <johnbender> hopefully not
[14:02:05] <johnbender> :(\
[14:02:08] <toddmparker_> i guess the question is whether this is a bad change or just a risky change
[14:02:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's both
[14:02:20] <toddmparker_> if it's just risky, we can change in 1.1
[14:02:32] <johnbender> the change we _need_ to make is just risky
[14:02:34] <toddmparker_> i like it!
[14:02:44] <toddmparker_> bad + risky = fun
[14:02:47] <johnbender> and it's directly related to a multi page setup too
[14:03:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: my workaround = bad + risky
[14:03:02] <Wilto> I’m already writing a “buddy cop” movie about johnbender and toddmparker_.
[14:03:11] * johnbender laughs
[14:03:33] <toddmparker_> which of us gets accidentally shot in the buttocks?
[14:03:54] <toddmparker_> BENNNDERRRRRR
[14:03:55] <Wilto> All of us, depending on how much this fix breaks.
[14:04:16] <toddmparker_> did you leave your service revolver under the box of donuts on my seat AGAIN
[14:04:28] <Wilto> toddmparker_ is a loose cannon—he plays by his own rules.
[14:04:30] <eddiemonge> johnbender: you are still in LA right?
[14:04:59] <Wilto> oh man perfect
[14:05:28] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah lol
[14:05:33] <johnbender> why?
[14:05:52] <Wilto> “Beverly Hills Devs.”
[14:05:57] <johnbender> lawl
[14:06:04] <eddiemonge> curious. someday i hope to move back to southern cali as i dislike the northern version
[14:06:42] <johnbender> eddiemonge: that's too bad
[14:06:52] <johnbender> eddiemonge: being a tech person here is at least semi novel
[14:06:54] <johnbender> that's a whin
[14:06:56] <johnbender> *win
[14:07:01] <johnbender> whin is how the french spell it
[14:07:03] <johnbender> :/
[14:07:25] <johnbender> kinblas: let me know if you have a moment to provide input on this
[14:07:55] <johnbender> if I don't hear back shortly I'm going to post it and suffer the consequences of any ridicule I receive for its stupidity
[14:08:03] <eddiemonge> yeah, if there were good tech jobs there id move back in a heartbeat, well maybe 2

[14:10:01] * kinblas catches up
[14:10:05] <kinblas> johnbender; I'm with you
[14:10:16] <kinblas> I don't want to introduce anything un-tested at the last minute
[14:10:32] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm hoping this might work for them in the meantime without causing issues
[14:10:33] <Wilto> Dibs on being the gruff police chief who is sick and tired of your collective shenanigans.
[14:10:41] <toddmparker_> gold in the comments:
[14:10:42] <toddmparker_> ALL YOU YOUNGSTERS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THIS IS .. ITS REAL MUSIC FROM THE 80'S HALF OF YALL HAVENT SEEN THE DAMN MOVIE YOUR JUST ON HERE CUS FAMILY GUY.. ITS SAD HOW KIDS THESE DAYS DONT KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE PAST THAT GAVE BIRTH TO THE STUPID HIP HOP THERE IS NOW.. THIS HERE IS REAL FUCKING MUSIC THUMBS UP﻿ SO KIDS FROM THE FUTURE WILL KNOW WHATS REAL MUSIC
[14:10:56] <Wilto> Oh, internet.
[14:11:29] <kinblas> johnbender: I think I may have missed the proposed workaround
[14:11:45] <eddiemonge> consider yourself lucky then kinblas
[14:11:48] <johnbender> "I'll pistol whip the next man who says 'shenanigans'" ... "Hey Farva what's that place you really like to eat at? The one with all the shit on the walls?"  ... "Shenanigans?" ... "OOOOOHHHHHH"
[14:11:53] <eddiemonge> lol jk johnbender
[14:12:08] <Wilto> Classic.
[14:12:12] <toddmparker_> WAT?
[14:12:46] <johnbender> kinblas: https://gist.github.com/d99d2ebc39f338d96704
[14:13:58] <johnbender> kinblas: this fixes the issue because it moves the overflow-x: hidden up to the body
[14:14:12] <Wilto> johnbender: Madness.
[14:14:20] <johnbender> or some parent inline element if people are being insane
[14:14:46] <johnbender> kinblas: we have to leave the $.mobile.pageContainer but at least this fixes the css issue
[14:14:56] <kinblas> lol
[14:14:59] <johnbender> that causes the select menu's to break
[14:15:16] <Wilto> ?flip
[14:15:16] <bot-t> (╯‵Д′)╯彡┻━┻
[14:15:27] <johnbender> I am deliberately using parent and not body
[14:15:42] <toddmparker_> ok, i see what we shouldn't ever add this monkey business
[14:16:28] <toddmparker_> what is the overflow-x rule for?
[14:17:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: thats in ui-mobile-viewport
[14:17:30] <johnbender> that's one part of the origina issue
[14:17:45] <johnbender> sorry I thought you css folks were up to speed on this one, I suppose I should have asked first
[14:17:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2066#issuecomment-1974329
[14:18:02] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[14:18:12] <johnbender> that's the minimal example
[14:18:19] <johnbender> the binding doesn't matter
[14:18:26] <johnbender> that was just to demonstrate that the click handler was firing
[14:18:35] <Wilto> Ah, yeah, I’ve been seeing this in fits and starts.
[14:18:50] <toddmparker_> yeah, understand the issue
[14:19:16] <toddmparker_> but i'm wondering if the overflow-x rules is needed. If that's the issue.
[14:19:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I wondered the same thing but I don't really know what he consequences would be and it's late in the game
[14:20:15] <toddmparker_> is this to present the page from scrolling sideways when scrolling down?
[14:20:15] <johnbender> this is where tests are a great help with js since they can sometimes tell you "why" when they fail, obviously that doesn't apply to css
[14:20:18] <johnbender> :(
[14:20:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I haven't the slightest
[14:20:33] <johnbender> maybe we can email scott?
[14:20:38] <toddmparker_> nope. css knows no reason or master
[14:20:56] <toddmparker_> assuming we do this for this reason: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5543495/mobile-safari-viewport-preventing-horizontal-scrolling
[14:21:00] <Wilto> I can dig into this, if it’s helpful.
[14:21:14] <toddmparker_> yeah, true
[14:21:27] <Wilto> toddmparker_: The above seems pretty likely, yeah.
[14:21:49] <toddmparker_> just confirming: johnbender - if we didn't set overflow-x, would that make a big difference?
[14:22:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that would fix the issue
[14:22:53] <Wilto> ON IT.
[14:23:16] <toddmparker_> yeah, this looks like wilto's cup of tea
[14:23:49] <Wilto> I’VE HAD IT. YOU TWO DEVCOPS ARE SUSPENDED. I’M TAKIN’ OVER THIS CASE MYSELF.
[14:24:17] * kinblas is late yet again due to real-person interactivity
[14:24:33] <kinblas> johnbender: toddmparker_: I think it was used to avoid horizontal scrolling
[14:24:39] <Wilto> kinblas: We’re cops now.
[14:24:44] <kinblas> lol
[14:24:52] * kinblas throws a donut at Wilto
[14:24:55] <Wilto> But yeah, that’s definitely my thinking.
[14:24:58] <Wilto> ALSO OFF THE CASE
[14:24:59] * johnbender hands in his badge.
[14:25:15] <kinblas> we used to have these problems early on
[14:25:21] <kinblas> where folks would be styling things
[14:25:24] <toddmparker_> ...and you gun, bender
[14:25:29] <kinblas> and somehow the padding/margins/borders
[14:25:38] <kinblas> would end up with a pixel over the width of the viewport
[14:25:45] <toddmparker_> box model fun
[14:25:49] <toddmparker_> i see
[14:25:53] <kinblas> so the app would scroll sideways
[14:25:58] <kinblas> sometimes if you didn't flick right
[14:26:01] <toddmparker_> could we put this on the active page?
[14:26:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: if they do something funny to the active page it would still cause a problem though that work for the page contents of course
[14:27:27] <toddmparker_> just wondering if we could move this rule down a bit if it would help with this
[14:27:44] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm not sure, the body (aka viewport) acts as our clip
[14:28:06] <johnbender> it certainly could but as with everything else it'd have to wait
[14:28:10] <kinblas> when we go to animate in (slide in)
[14:28:22] <kinblas> the document will be as wide as the 2 pages sitting next to each other
[14:28:36] <Wilto> Okay, so… Yeah, the overflow-x: hidden; prevents horizontal scrolling.
[14:28:39] <toddmparker_> meep.
[14:28:44] <Wilto> But functionally, do we need that?
[14:28:52] * kinblas notes that transforms are/or-will affect the document width/height
[14:28:54] <Wilto> I mean, it doesn’t scroll anywhere.
[14:29:16] <kinblas> I think Scott added it as a safeguard
[14:29:29] <kinblas> I seem to remember one of our samples had this problem
[14:29:32] <Wilto> It makes sense. I mean, better to have it than not.
[14:29:34] <kinblas> because the image was large
[14:30:11] <johnbender> so we could tell them to try it out with a style on the form overlow-x: visible?
[14:30:16] <johnbender> hmmm
[14:30:39] <johnbender> and beware odd overflow issues?
[14:30:41] <kinblas> so are they really writing out multi-page documents with a form around everything?
[14:30:48] <johnbender> kinblas: yes
[14:30:50] <kinblas> or are they writing out multi-documeunts?
[14:31:13] <kinblas> shoot, I was hoping the latter, cause then their form could be the page
[14:32:25] <johnbender> kinblas: in the case where they have a wizard thats a multi-page document wrapping it in a form is the easiest way to get it done
[14:32:38] <Wilto> Hm.
[14:32:49] <Wilto> form.ui-mobile-viewport { overflow-x: visible; }
[14:32:54] <Wilto> ?boom
[14:32:54] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[14:33:23] <kinblas> heh
[14:33:49] <Wilto> I can add that and do some testing over here, too.
[14:34:01] <kinblas> body, .ui-mobile-viewport { ... }
[14:34:07] <kinblas> ??
[14:34:21] <Wilto> “form.ui-mobile-viewport { overflow-x: visible; }”
[14:34:25] <johnbender> kinblas: I think in this case I'd rather they focus it on the single situation
[14:34:47] <kinblas> do we have any rules targeted at the body ?
[14:34:52] <kinblas> if not then I think we're ok
[14:35:01] * kinblas notes the famous last words
[14:35:11] <toddmparker_> i don't see any body styles
[14:35:15] <Wilto> Nothin’ that involves overflow.
[14:35:25] <toddmparker_> we scope everything to our junk
[14:35:40] <kinblas> is form a block element?
[14:35:49] * kinblas should know this
[14:35:51] <johnbender> kinblas: yes
[14:35:55] <johnbender> says the spec
[14:36:03] <Wilto> Yep.
[14:36:06] <kinblas> ok, I was just wondering if we needed to add a display: block
[14:36:08] <Wilto> I mean, in a weird way.
[14:36:18] <kinblas> to make sure the layout behaves as expected
[14:36:20] <johnbender> kinblas: and if it wasn't this wouldn't be a bug actually
[14:36:27] <Wilto> I’ve seen forms behaving non-blockily. Which is a word.
[14:36:30] <johnbender> if you set display: inline that actually fixes it
[14:37:05] <kinblas> ew ... causing inline to contain blocks ... this causes browsers like mozilla to do strange layout tricks
[14:37:18] <johnbender> kinblas: yah we had this discussion the first ime
[14:37:19] <kinblas> we used to call that the holy trinity case
[14:37:20] <johnbender> *time
[14:37:50] <toddmparker_> modern FF, kinblas?
[14:38:16] <kinblas> toddmparker_: once again legacy knowledge, so I'd have to ask one of my friends who is more current
[14:38:47] <kinblas> toddmparker_: my mozilla internals knowledge ended circa 2004
[14:39:05] <toddmparker_> not a supported browser
[14:39:15] <toddmparker_> so Wilto's suggestion might be fine
[14:39:16] <toddmparker_> “form.ui-mobile-viewport { overflow-x: visible; }”
[14:39:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: ok so I'm going to suggest form.ui-mobile-viewport { overflow-x: visible; } while pointing out that this might cause horizontal scrolling issuses
[14:39:27] <Wilto> Yeah, I think that works.
[14:39:33] <toddmparker_> so if you have a form, we don't set that overflow to hidden
[14:39:47] <toddmparker_> +1
[14:39:48] <Wilto> At least then we’re quarantining weird issues to people that were seeing the bigger issue in the first place, yeah?
[14:39:55] <toddmparker_> fix it, document it
[14:39:56] <Wilto> No risk of screwing anyone else up.
[14:39:57] <toddmparker_> close it
[14:40:03] <Wilto> ?cc
[14:40:03] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[14:40:07] <toddmparker_> yeah, well i hope not
[14:40:13] <Wilto> I mean, knock on wood.
[14:40:41] <Wilto> This is for toddmparker_:
[14:40:43] <Wilto> ?flip
[14:40:43] <bot-t> (╯‵Д′)╯彡┻━┻
[14:41:56] <Wilto> ?comboflip
[14:41:57] <bot-t> ┻━┻ ︵ヽ( ` Д ´ )ﾉ︵ ┻━┻
[14:42:18] <Wilto> Ahem. Anyway.
[14:42:29] <toddmparker_> i still don't see it
[14:43:31] <toddmparker_> ascii flips don't make sense to me
[14:43:35] <toddmparker_> i need pixels
[14:43:53] <Wilto> toddmparker_:（╯°□°）╯ ︵ ┻━┻
[14:44:46] <toddmparker_> like that better
[14:46:41] <toddmparker_> so if we test this and it works should we just add this rule and document it?
[14:48:43] <toddmparker_> kinblas: is this issue critical for us to fix for 1.0?
[14:48:43] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2652
[14:50:26] <kinblas> toddmparker_: hmmm we probably should, but that would require us to scan any pages we load for a base tag ... and then track base tags for each page.
[14:50:34] <kinblas> I was hesitating on adding this at this point
[14:50:40] <toddmparker_> that seems like a big change
[14:50:44] <kinblas> we've managed to go this long without ever seeing that problem
[14:50:56] <kinblas> it's still a valid problem though
[14:51:17] <toddmparker_> yeah, i'm going to leave this open and maybe even bump it to high, but remove teh 1.0 milestone
[14:51:21] <toddmparker_> seem ok?
[14:51:57] <Wilto> Who’s holdin’ an Android device?
[14:52:02] <Wilto> http://jsbin.com/uxusix/31
[14:52:03] <johnbender> I am
[14:53:18] <toddmparker_> kinblas: on this android footer issue, you fixed the original problem but that guy piled on at the end
[14:53:19] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2596
[14:53:27] <toddmparker_> close this and have him open new tickets?
[14:53:40] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ok so I'm about to land a minor change that brings the 400 listview load time from 3050 ms to 1700 msecs
[14:53:45] <kinblas> almost 50%
[14:53:56] <kinblas> I need to look at the other components
[14:54:54] * kinblas does the math
[14:54:58] <kinblas> dang, only 43%
[14:55:21] <Wilto> Just delete some semicolons to make up that last 7%.
[14:55:27] <kinblas> heh
[14:55:27] <Wilto> “Weight reduction.”
[14:55:35] <gseguin> I guess it's not worth it then
[14:55:40] <gseguin> ;)
[14:55:50] <Wilto> START OVER
[14:55:51] <kinblas> the lame thing is that it still feels slow
[14:55:55] <kinblas> Wilto: lol
[14:56:16] <kinblas> I guess any load time over 1sec feels slow
[14:58:19] <toddmparker_> still, great progress kinblas
[14:58:47] <toddmparker_> i think the slowness after it renders is still making if feel chuggy
[14:59:49] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] jblas pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/BuXaEw
[14:59:49] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Some minor listview tweaking to eliminate 1200 $.fn.find calls in our 400 item listview test case. - jblas@adobe.com
[14:59:49] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile - jblas@adobe.com
[15:00:01] <kinblas> toddmparker_: after it renders?
[15:00:09] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:00:41] <kinblas> toddmparker_: you mean when you interact with it?
[15:00:49] <toddmparker_> so is that the load + enhancement time or just the time it takes to enhance the list after it's been ajax'd in
[15:00:58] <toddmparker_> yeah, the scrolling
[15:02:09] <kinblas> toddmparker: it was taking us 3 seconds just to enhance that one list
[15:02:09] <kinblas> toddmparker: now it only takes 1.7 seconds to enhance
[15:02:21] <Wilto> Damn.
[15:02:23] <kinblas> toddmparker: on iPad I was seeing like 500-700msecs just to load the page
[15:02:46] <kinblas> that 's the difference in time from when we fire the $.ajax() to when the success was called
[15:03:41] <kinblas> what it looks like is that death of a thousand paper-cuts thing
[15:03:52] <kinblas> we are doing sooooo many find()/children() etc
[15:04:00] <kinblas> to find the pieces of our markup just to put classes on them
[15:06:54] <kinblas> basically all I've been doing is trying to rework some of the way we do things to reduce the number of jquery method calls we're making
[15:07:04] <kinblas> for example doing stuff like:
[15:07:33] <kinblas> item.add( item.children( ".someClass" ) ).addClass( "someotherclass");
[15:07:38] <kinblas> I split into 2 calls
[15:07:50] <kinblas> because it's faster just to make 2 calls then to trigger add() due to the underlying things it does
[15:07:53] <kinblas> like merging etc
[15:08:36] <Wilto> …This task actually sounds kind of fun, in a tragic sort of way.
[15:08:43] <kinblas> lol
[15:08:51] <kinblas> I'll tell you what' s maddening
[15:08:57] <kinblas> is getting data from the device to desktop
[15:09:18] <kinblas> I need to either wire this profiler up to souder's jdrop, or write my own form submit thingie
[15:12:00] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/g6m64w
[15:12:00] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #2066 — Select menus now open normally on Android when the page is wrapped in a form element. ♥ you, .NET. - Mat Marquis
[15:12:06] <Wilto> Hey, I pushed that overflow— yeah, that.
[15:12:14] <toddmparker_> nice Wilto
[15:12:14] <Wilto> Just something to keep an eye on.
[15:12:21] <kinblas> I keep forgetting about those emoticons
[15:12:21] <johnbender> eh
[15:12:29] <kinblas> I've been meaning to try 'em out
[15:12:33] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto i was thinking we'd just make that work around
[15:12:36] <johnbender> :
[15:12:37] <johnbender> :(
[15:12:43] <Wilto> Oh. Hm.
[15:12:43] <johnbender> and let them use it
[15:12:48] <toddmparker_> not fix it?
[15:12:58] <toddmparker_> this seems pretty safe
[15:13:05] <Wilto> I dunno; I can’t see any harm in this, at a glance.
[15:13:10] <Wilto> But, “famous last words.”
[15:13:20] <kinblas> Wilto: you're a gamblin' man
[15:13:22] <toddmparker_> and it is scoped to only affect dumb .net syntax
[15:13:25] <Wilto> They said the same thing about asbestos.
[15:13:31] <toddmparker_> so if you follow the rules, it's all cool
[15:13:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: if we introduce horizontal scrolling in peoples apps post 1.0 that would be really bad no?
[15:13:50] <Wilto> Yeah, but it would only happen for people using .NET.
[15:13:53] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:13:56] <toddmparker_> boo
[15:14:04] <toddmparker_> here's how i look at it
[15:14:12] <toddmparker_> there are lots of people using .net
[15:14:24] <Wilto> johnbender: Even if they get that weird horizontal snap, it beats completely busted selects.
[15:14:27] <kinblas> Yay, the perf fixes so far bring us under the JS runtime cap for iOS 4.2
[15:14:32] <toddmparker_> of those, only a handful will find this ticket or docs page
[15:14:32] <johnbender> Wilto: it can also happen for folks who just want to make a multiple page wizard
[15:14:35] <kinblas> I can now see the 400 item list on my 2nd Gen iPod
[15:14:48] <toddmparker_> so they may have broken form elements
[15:14:55] <Wilto> johnbender: Only if that .ui-mobile-viewport class is on a form.
[15:14:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: fair point
[15:15:04] <Wilto> .ui-mobile-viewport {  margin: 0; overflow-x: hidden; -webkit-text-size-adjust: none; -ms-text-size-adjust:none; -webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); }
[15:15:04] <Wilto> form.ui-mobile-viewport { overflow-x: visible; }
[15:15:08] <toddmparker_> this makes it functional, even if it could add a scrollbar
[15:15:21] <toddmparker_> i'd rather make sure our styles are tight so that doesn't happen in the library
[15:15:36] <Wilto> Yeah. Plus, if they’ve got width: 110% going on somewhere, that’s kind of their problem.
[15:15:47] <Wilto> Not to be terse, but y’know.
[15:15:53] <Wilto> Chrome don’t fix that for us, either.
[15:15:54] <toddmparker_> yeah, if they bust the styles, that's not our issue
[15:16:04] <johnbender> Wilto: well I'm less worried about someone being stupid like that and more some subtle browser oddity
[15:16:06] <toddmparker_> android is so fussy
[15:16:22] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, agreed—like I said, we’ll keep an eye on it.
[15:16:22] <johnbender> alright
[15:16:53] <johnbender> I think the "it's a sufficiently small subset of users" is at least acceptable
[15:16:57] <Wilto> At least this way, we’re only threatening to break things for people with form.ui-mobile-viewport
[15:16:58] <johnbender> and we will most likely know right away
[15:17:05] <Wilto> And it’s less broken than leaving it as-is.
[15:17:08] <johnbender> err
[15:17:12] <Wilto> I mean… Hopefully.
[15:17:14] <johnbender> we'll know what the proble is right away
[15:17:16] <toddmparker_> sort of choosign a lesser evil
[15:17:20] <johnbender> if they bring it to us
[15:17:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: indeed
[15:17:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: well
[15:17:31] <toddmparker_> i'd take horizontal scrolling over broken selects
[15:17:32] <johnbender> sorry
[15:17:34] <johnbender> pendantics
[15:17:38] <Wilto> We’ll tell them to switch to Ruby on Rails. “Case cloased” again.
[15:17:44] <johnbender> it's a lesser evil only if they are using native selects
[15:18:19] <toddmparker_> ...which is the default
[15:19:37] <johnbender> I guess I'm concerned that there are more people out there wrapping their pages in forms than it would otherwise appear if only because they don't test that much on their android devices
[15:19:42] <johnbender> maybe thats not the case
[15:20:12] <johnbender> for those people we've introduced a bug they didn't know about or care about possibly
[15:20:15] <Wilto> I hate those people, johnbender.
[15:20:21] <Wilto> I will call them and tell them such.
[15:20:25] <johnbender> although I suppose that brings us back to your point about the two evils
[15:20:39] <johnbender> even if they don't know about said evil
[15:20:52] <johnbender> err the first evil
[15:21:00] * johnbender is surrounded by a myriad of evils
[15:21:05] * johnbender crosses himself
[15:21:10] <johnbender> alright
[15:21:18] <toddmparker_> guess the point of the library is that if you follow our conventions, things will just work
[15:21:19] <johnbender> I'm done whining
[15:21:21] <Wilto> GitHub should rename it to the “evil tracker.”
[15:21:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #196: SUCCESS in 13 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/196/
[15:21:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jblas: Some minor listview tweaking to eliminate 1200 $.fn.find calls in our 400 item listview test case.
[15:21:44] <Wilto> Yeah, I mean, if they’re wrapping the page in a form without .NET held to their temple, I figure they’ve probably got a fair share of their own bugs to solve.
[15:21:52] <Wilto> I think we’ll be the least of their concerns.
[15:21:55] <toddmparker_> johnbender: these are the kind of ugly, ugly decisions we front-end people do every day. just close your eyes and commit
[15:22:17] <Wilto> I still have nightmares of underscore hacks, toddmparker_.
[15:22:29] <johnbender> "just close your eyes and commit" == "john, slit your wrists"
[15:22:32] <johnbender> lol
[15:22:38] <toddmparker_> i know, i know
[15:22:49] <johnbender> I'm in!
[15:22:53] <Wilto> I’ll accept full blame if this breaks anyone’s stuff.
[15:22:57] <johnbender> I'm glad we can tell these people something
[15:22:57] <toddmparker_> at least it's fixed for the comon case
[15:23:02] <Wilto> And I’ll chew ‘em out for their use of forms.
[15:23:06] <Wilto> The Enforcer™.
[15:23:14] <toddmparker_> and we know that the worst case is a bit or horizontal scrolling if they were sloppy with their css
[15:23:26] <toddmparker_> it's a predicable css change
[15:23:40] <Wilto> Yeah, that too—easy rollback, if we gotta.
[15:23:50] <johnbender> agreed on both counts
[15:25:42] <toddmparker_> it's an ugly world out there
[15:30:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/sLQICQ
[15:30:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #2911 from charlieCollins/patch-1 - Todd Parker
[15:35:40] <johnbender> Wilto: so https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2588
[15:35:44] <johnbender> has been assigned to you
[15:36:02] <johnbender> I've included the debug page where I was seeing the classes that allowed it to work
[15:36:05] <johnbender> testing on the emulator
[15:43:30] <johnbender> toddmparker_: you're "what to look for" is 1000000 times better than mine
[15:43:33] <johnbender> lol
[15:43:37] <johnbender> "look for horizontal scroll bars"
[15:43:43] <johnbender> as opposed to
[15:43:55] <johnbender> "blah blah blah blah overflow blah blah"
[15:47:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2418
[15:47:45] <johnbender> looks like scottjehl was into that one
[16:00:07] * kinblas grumbles
[16:00:35] <kinblas> man looking at stack traces ... our ability to speed things up are really hampered by our use/reliance on data attributes and $.data()
[16:00:47] <kinblas> the number of times we call data() is staggering
[16:01:12] <kinblas> and they all register less than a millisecond ... but they all add up ... those are the paper-cuts that are killing us
[16:02:33] <kinblas> example ... just loading the form gallery page results in 3379 calls to $.acceptData()
[16:03:14] <johnbender> kinblas: can we provide our own data that doesn't check acceptData?
[16:03:14] <kinblas> each one of those calls get's the element name and lowercases it
[16:03:42] <kinblas> johnbender: heh I was about to experiment with that
[16:03:51] <kinblas> stubbing out the camelcase code as well as the acceptData
[16:04:12] <johnbender> do i
[16:04:13] <johnbender> do it
[16:07:34] <kinblas> johnbender: so anyways, this is really pushing me to write that plugin that caches the last 'N' pages
[16:07:49] <johnbender> ah
[16:08:03] <kinblas> avoiding enhancement is key for page switching :-)
[16:08:32] <johnbender> I'm looking at the uiwebview
[16:20:27] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #197: SUCCESS in 12 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/197/
[16:20:28] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * charlie: Change usage of "the JQuery Mobile" that was repeated several times in one sentence. Also, tried to fix other typos seen on the live site (docuemnt, for example), but they appear to already be correct in source.
[16:20:28] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Fixes #2066 — Select menus now open normally on Android when the page is wrapped in a form element. ♥ you, .NET.
[16:41:35] <johnbender> kinblas: sigh, I was looking forward to that device
[16:41:52] <kinblas> johnbender: that'll teach ya to go on PTO
[16:41:55] <kinblas> :-P
[16:41:56] <johnbender> seriously
[16:42:07] <johnbender> I honestly didn't think they would turn that around so quick
[16:42:13] <kinblas> I know
[16:42:24] <kinblas> oh that reminds me, I need to ping RIM again
[16:42:34] <johnbender> kinblas: yes! please do
