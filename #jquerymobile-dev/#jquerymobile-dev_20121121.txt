[04:52:01] <uGoMobi> johnbender: gnarf : I just noticed that branch previews of branches that have been deleted stay alive.
[04:52:01] <uGoMobi> Example: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-widget/
[04:52:01] <uGoMobi> Is it possible to automatically remove the previews when a branch is removed from the repo?
[05:07:18] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[05:07:35] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:08:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: quick question do you think its safe to just close this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5311
[05:09:58] * uGoMobi is looking
[05:11:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you think this is still an issue when using on() instead of delegate?
[05:12:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes because its not an issue its how delegated events work 
[05:12:22] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:12:41] <arschmitz> you cant prevent a delegated event from bubbling 
[05:12:50] <uGoMobi> well it's not a JQM bug/issue so I think you can close it
[05:13:01] <arschmitz> it happens with all events the bubble not just swipe 
[05:13:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok that was my thought i just wanted a second oppinion before closing it 
[05:13:36] <uGoMobi> I understand
[05:13:58] <uGoMobi> was just thinking maybe things changed when on() was introduced
[05:14:14] <arschmitz> no i tried it just to be sure
[05:16:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: actually I don't see the same problem in your fiddle that uses click
[05:17:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i just realized i misread hes talking each fires twice not that the outer shouldnt fire
[05:17:13] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:20:58] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: then I think we shouldn't close yet
[05:21:16] <arschmitz> right no there is a real problem im looking at swipe right now
[05:21:28] <uGoMobi> ok cool
[05:25:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you do it like this it works as expected http://jsfiddle.net/NMDxE/30/
[05:26:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: stopImmediatePropagation() doesn't work but that is expected as you pointed out
[05:27:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: intresting 
[05:33:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: I think i see the problem its because swipe is triggered on cords not on an actual element
[05:34:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok, so we can fix this with a demo
[05:35:02] <uGoMobi> and a note in the docs
[05:35:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah just show the proper way to bind to swipe (like you did in your fiddle)
[05:37:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so how would you tag that docs and demo needed 
[05:37:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: also white milestone? 
[05:38:05] <arschmitz> *what
[06:09:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sorry, IRCCloud went down... labels for that issue look good
[06:09:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem.
[06:14:46] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on your series 40 issues i tried pages with javascript turned off completely and things still worked fine and page showed i noticed issues 5005 and 5309 seem to contradict each other since based on 5309 5005 should not even see a page
[06:17:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: issue reported of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5005 is talking about different platforms/browsers in one thread
[06:18:03] <uGoMobi> it's not completely clear
[06:18:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you have a series 40 device?
[06:18:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no sadly i dont
[06:19:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i just tried disabling js in several browsers devices to see if i could reproduce
[06:19:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure if that's the right way to test
[06:20:05] <uGoMobi> because a series 40 device will load the JS
[06:20:15] <uGoMobi> it runs on a proxy though :(
[06:20:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i just wanted to rule out that it wasent a more generic issue with javascript disabled since what i read indicated no dom maniipulation is supported at all
[06:21:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I understand
[06:22:24] <arschmitz> but no it seems specific to series 40 devices somthing with their proxy js probably (like you already were thinking)
[06:23:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: my best guess is a script error is stoping it dead in its tracks something due to the support being JavaScript 1.8 (executed in the proxy)
[06:24:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it gets hidden then error so no show
[06:25:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats just an educated guess though really
[06:25:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: it looks like the ui-mobile-rendering class is added but not removed
[06:25:46] <uGoMobi> that would explain a white page
[06:26:06] <uGoMobi> he didn't report an error or spinner or anything
[06:26:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right thats why im thinking a script error after that stops it from being removed
[06:26:28] <arschmitz> will a series 40 even show script errors most mobile devices wont 
[06:26:30] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I already made a change to the setTimeout
[06:30:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: see if it is an error if you can beat it lol 
[06:33:59] <toddmparker> morning
[06:33:59] <bot-t> (5 hours 49 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell toddmparker: table.reflow wasn't listed in mobile.js... works now
[06:34:17] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: thanks for re-naming those scripts and getting the reflow to work on test
[06:34:29] <toddmparker> sorry i spaced on the naming, you mentioned that earlier
[06:34:43] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[06:34:50] <uGoMobi> np
[06:34:53] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker
[06:38:41] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi and arschmitz 
[06:39:02] <toddmparker> looks like you tweaked the fallback for non-supported browsers too? 
[06:39:34] <toddmparker> timezones are fun, it's like uGoMobi and _|Nix|_ are the elves working at night :)
[06:40:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, maybe I shouldn't have pushed that to master yet
[06:41:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker: LOL i get up so early i actually end up with quite a bit of crossover with them. 
[06:41:46] <arschmitz> yesterday _|Nix|_ tried to make me go back to bed!
[06:42:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: it's part of fixing symbian issues
[06:43:54] <uGoMobi> not sure if the setTimeout compatibility issue applies to those browsers
[06:44:31] <toddmparker> we'll have to do more testing
[06:44:58] <toddmparker> i'll try to find an older nokia. the one i fired up yesterday worked surprisingly well considering how crappy the display was
[06:45:17] <toddmparker> BTW - I just removed the 1.3 millstone on this one after re-reading the b5bp thread: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3851
[06:45:24] <uGoMobi> I commented on the symbian issues and ask people to test
[06:45:37] <toddmparker> thanks
[06:46:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2401#issuecomment-10599340
[06:46:46] <toddmparker> this should be a fun project to tackle - autocomplete demo - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5096
[06:47:27] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: that looks great
[06:47:32] <uGoMobi> yeah it does
[06:47:54] <toddmparker> behavior is interesting - the sliders push each other instead of stopping
[06:48:28] <uGoMobi> I think that's a good thing
[06:49:28] <toddmparker> works great with a mouse, but buggy on touch
[06:49:34] <toddmparker> try ios
[06:50:05] <toddmparker> may just be he's not binding to the right touch events to update it fast enough
[06:50:38] <toddmparker> just the left handle is buggy
[06:51:43] <uGoMobi> yeah I see what you mean
[06:51:59] <toddmparker> might be easier to fix this if it was internal to slider
[06:52:04] <toddmparker> but this is very promising
[06:52:19] <toddmparker> i found another site that used jQuery Mobile dual sliders
[06:52:25] <toddmparker> wish i could remember
[06:55:15] <toddmparker> http://jsfiddle.net/fbGV4/1/
[06:55:24] <toddmparker> seems a lot simpler
[06:57:09] <toddmparker> the fill isn't working 
[06:57:15] <gseguin> mornin' all
[06:57:55] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[06:57:55] <toddmparker> hey gseguin 
[06:57:57] <gseguin> just poping my head here to let you know that I'm traveling today
[06:58:06] <toddmparker> oh, ok. where to?
[06:58:22] <gseguin> not too far, like 4hour drive
[06:58:29] <gseguin> Steamboat Springs
[06:59:00] <gseguin> but I'm basically off until next Monday
[06:59:11] <gseguin> will check email and address urgent stuff though
[07:00:00] <gseguin> toddmparker and other american folks have a very good Thanksgiving holiday
[07:03:53] <toddmparker> you too!
[07:04:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: Thanks you too!
[07:04:07] <uGoMobi> is Thanksgiving tomorrow?
[07:04:14] <gseguin> yes uGoMobi
[07:04:31] <uGoMobi> no meeting?

[07:25:01] <toddmparker> uGoMobi and arschmitz - should this be closed? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5311#issuecomment-10596056
[07:25:13] <toddmparker> btw - i have a meeting for the next 1.5 hours
[07:25:32] <uGoMobi> I am away too for a couple of hours
[07:25:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: shouldn't we close that issue once we added info/demo to docs?
[07:25:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i was going to leave open untill we have added a note to the docs about it 
[07:26:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: guess we agree lol
[07:26:09] <toddmparker> arschmitz: ok
[07:26:15] <toddmparker> yep
[08:31:46] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I just looked at /test/ on a S60 running a very old version and saw the basic experience - no white pages
[08:31:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: toddmparker:  i updated the fiddle for dual sliders you were working at to make the highlight work. http://jsfiddle.net/fbGV4/11/
[08:32:11] <toddmparker> man, these are terrible browsers
[08:32:28] <toddmparker> arschmitz: sweet
[08:32:46] <toddmparker> what do you need to add to the URL to clear out all the fiddle UI?
[08:33:31] <toddmparker> that's what i hate about jsfiddle. i like js bin's convention of removing /edit/ to view
[08:33:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker: show
[08:34:03] <toddmparker> ah
[08:34:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker i agree i was just using the fiddle because its what you had posted already
[08:34:18] <toddmparker> I wanted to add the viewport meta tag to zoom this back in properly
[08:34:26] <toddmparker> where do you access the head in jsfiddle?
[08:34:45] <toddmparker>    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> 
[08:35:01] <arschmitz> fiddle is weird for that
[08:35:27] <arschmitz> i think to do that you would have to add the body and html etc in the html view
[08:35:32] <arschmitz> ill just copy to a jsbin
[08:35:32] <toddmparker> arschmitz: on my iPhone, the fill isn't in the right place
[08:36:04] <arschmitz> yeah i forgot to hit update the last time
[08:36:20] <toddmparker> 12?
[08:36:21] <arschmitz> stupid not autoupdateing fiddles
[08:36:28] <arschmitz> yes
[08:38:48] <toddmparker> that works great!!
[08:38:56] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/514/
[08:39:13] <arschmitz> same thing just in jsbin with the viewport meta
[08:39:57] <toddmparker> better
[08:40:12] <toddmparker> testing wp7 - no touch events
[08:40:38] <arschmitz> hmm that dosent modify the events at all its the normal sliders
[08:41:13] <arschmitz> its really just two normal sliders positioned ontop of each other
[08:42:10] <toddmparker> yeah. on wp7, you tap the track to move the handle since you can't drag
[08:42:21] <toddmparker> i've been wondering how this would work in those cases
[08:42:24] <arschmitz> is it that way with our normal slider?
[08:42:34] <toddmparker> turns out, you can tap the track to move the right slider, but not the left
[08:42:52] <toddmparker> was hoping i could tap the left to gig sit focus, then tap the track to move it but the right shifts instead
[08:43:06] <toddmparker> yes, this is what happens with the single slider too
[08:43:16] <toddmparker> we have the text inputs as backup anyway
[08:43:19] <arschmitz> oh ok iv never used a wp7
[08:43:32] <toddmparker> webos too - no touch events
[08:44:35] <arschmitz> hmm im not even really sure a good way to work around that i wonder if the ui slider you can move both by tapping handle then track i know you can on ios
[08:44:57] <toddmparker> i bet it does what this does
[08:45:03] <toddmparker> anyway, this is great
[08:45:31] <toddmparker> if we can clean this code up so it actually works better, we can try to get this in for 1.3
[08:45:39] <toddmparker> as a demo at the very least
[08:45:46] <arschmitz> should be pretty easy to roll into an extension
[08:45:57] <toddmparker> needs more spacing between the slider and inputs - they overlap now
[08:46:30] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i didnt mess with the css at all its just what was in that fiddle i noticed that too
[08:46:32] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah? well if you want to tackle this, I know it would be hugely popular. we get a lot of requests for this.
[08:46:54] <toddmparker> yeah, the css is probably too fixed but the general idea is good
[08:47:07] <toddmparker> doesn't seem like a ton of code
[08:47:30] <toddmparker> if this is an extension, then we can package the css for this separately and only include it if you want ranges
[08:47:40] <toddmparker> you are the extension master now :)
[08:48:07] <arschmitz> not at all because it dosent actually do a two handle slider its two regular ones repositioned with just a function to link the highlight 
[08:48:18] <arschmitz> so minimizes code
[08:48:48] <arschmitz> ha ha well ill get plenty of practice when we start 1.4 too 
[08:49:10] <toddmparker> arschmitz: are these based on that guys updated code? seems like he made changes recently
[08:49:23] <toddmparker> or is this based on that jsfiddle i posted earlier?
[08:49:36] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2401#issuecomment-10603186
[08:49:38] <arschmitz> this is the jsfiddle you posted
[08:50:02] <toddmparker> ah, cool. seemed way simpler than that guy's code
[08:50:13] <arschmitz> very much so
[08:50:24] <toddmparker> maybe you can comment on that and say thanks and say we're working on a solution
[08:50:49] <toddmparker> i agree - it's just two sliders positioned over each other. the only code needed is the fill connection
[08:51:00] <toddmparker> people tend to overcomplicate
[08:51:34] <arschmitz> sure. oh one thing it wont actually be an extension it will be a seperate widget but still simple enough
[08:52:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thoughts on a name for it? slider.dualrange or something?
[08:53:18] <toddmparker> maybe just slider.range
[08:53:27] <arschmitz> sounds good
[08:53:41] <toddmparker> http://jqueryui.com/slider/#range
[08:53:43] <toddmparker> yep
[08:54:08] <arschmitz> cool keep it consistant
[08:54:27] <toddmparker> yeah
[08:54:36] <toddmparker> we should look at the ui demos for ideas
[08:54:37] <toddmparker> http://jqueryui.com/slider/#colorpicker
[08:54:41] <toddmparker> might be a nice easy one
[08:55:08] <toddmparker> wonder if we should add the max/min fills too
[08:55:09] <toddmparker> http://jqueryui.com/slider/#rangemin
[08:55:20] <toddmparker> at some point. be an easy one to add to the core slider
[08:55:33] <toddmparker> just a a fill from that start or end
[08:56:34] <toddmparker> btw - the width on the sliders in that jsbin seem really narrow. doesn't seem right but that will get cleaned up anyway since this will just use our regular slider
[08:56:36] <arschmitz> yeah would be pretty easy to add on at some point
[08:57:30] <arschmitz> yeah the reason for that is its displaying them inline but with the actual inputs above instead of beside
[08:57:38] <arschmitz> so it makes the slider seem too narrow
[08:57:41] <toddmparker> i see
[08:57:48] <toddmparker> too much janky css
[08:58:11] <arschmitz> yeah i wont actually use anything from the jsfiddle or bin ill just use it as the basis
[08:58:25] <toddmparker> right, cool. this is hawt
[08:58:52] <arschmitz> yeah super simple too im not sure i ever would have thought of it on my own
[09:04:19] <toddmparker> yeah, that the nice thing. that guy came up with the idea and we completely re-do it so it really works. everyone wins
[09:05:04] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: just tested reflow mode on WP7.5 and apparently setting inline-block on a table doesn't work there
[09:05:14] <toddmparker> so you just get the full table jammed in
[09:05:29] <arschmitz> i thought that was ie8 equiv?
[09:05:46] <toddmparker> supposed to be ie9 in 7.5
[09:05:53] <arschmitz> well even worse
[09:06:18] <toddmparker> firing up ie9 in browserstack
[09:06:31] <arschmitz> i hate old ie's lack of inline-block 
[09:06:38] <arschmitz> i have real ie9 im on a pc
[09:06:45] <arschmitz> want me to check it out
[09:07:14] <toddmparker> wow, this doesn't work in IE9
[09:07:23] <toddmparker> displays like a normal table
[09:09:28] <toddmparker> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5091503/how-can-i-make-display-block-work-on-a-td-in-ie

[09:10:52] <toddmparker> uGoMobi ^^
[09:12:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: wow thats annoying!
[09:12:24] <toddmparker> anyone have IE 9 installed on your machine to try a few of these suggestions? i don't anymore
[09:13:34] <arschmitz> i do
[09:16:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker: anythoughts on which trick to try first?
[09:18:43] <toddmparker> hmm
[09:19:24] <toddmparker> table,
[09:19:24] <toddmparker> thead,
[09:19:26] <toddmparker> tfoot,
[09:19:27] <toddmparker> tbody,
[09:19:29] <toddmparker> tr,
[09:19:30] <toddmparker> th,
[09:19:32] <toddmparker> td {
[09:19:33] <toddmparker>     display:block;
[09:19:35] <toddmparker>     width:100%;
[09:19:36] <toddmparker>     -webkit-box-sizing: border-box;
[09:19:38] <toddmparker>     -moz-box-sizing: border-box;
[09:19:39] <toddmparker>     box-sizing: border-box;
[09:19:41] <toddmparker>     float:left;
[09:19:42] <toddmparker>     clear:left;
[09:19:43] <toddmparker> }
[09:20:10] <toddmparker> oh - You don't need the display: block though. The float takes care of that for you
[09:20:38] <toddmparker> OR
[09:20:38] <toddmparker> http://jsfiddle.net/bHzsC/1/
[09:21:05] <toddmparker> wait, that's the same as above but worse. the border-box deals with padding
[09:21:14] <toddmparker> ignore that last one
[09:21:42] <arschmitz> the fiddle works fine in ie
[09:21:50] <toddmparker> cool
[09:22:12] <arschmitz> ill try adding the css to your tables demo and see what happens
[09:22:16] <toddmparker> ok
[09:22:25] <toddmparker> if that doesn't work, this might:
[09:22:27] <toddmparker> tr {
[09:22:28] <toddmparker>   display: block;
[09:22:28] <toddmparker>   position: relative
[09:22:29] <toddmparker> }
[09:22:50] <toddmparker> though that seems like it could be trouble
[09:23:08] <arschmitz> possibly
[09:23:52] <arschmitz> ill push the better looking solution to my server so you can test on wp7 too
[09:32:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker: got it working well in chrome and ie9 pushing to my server now so you can check it out
[09:35:54] <arschmitz> toddmparker: www.uglymongrel.com/jqm/
[09:36:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: then click table-reflow
[09:37:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker: if you click the right link instead it will take you to the tests (table tests still pass)
[09:38:12] <toddmparker> awesome
[09:39:46] <toddmparker> works great on my WP7.5 phone
[09:39:55] <arschmitz> sweet
[09:40:08] <arschmitz> i had to actually add 2 rules not just the one but simple enough
[09:40:24] <arschmitz> the rule you suggested and then one to negate it on large screens
[09:40:44] <toddmparker> so you added that to the breakpoint?
[09:41:30] <arschmitz> the one to negateiti added to the breakpoint
[09:41:42] <toddmparker> ok
[09:41:49] <toddmparker> checks out in ie9 desktop
[09:41:52] <arschmitz> which is just clear:none; float:none
[09:41:52] <toddmparker> trying ie8
[09:42:28] <arschmitz> oh and width:auto;
[09:43:10] <toddmparker> no dice in ie8
[09:43:17] <arschmitz> darn
[09:43:39] <toddmparker> i.e. 9 is the most important one
[09:43:59] <toddmparker> no dice in ie7 either
[09:44:00] <arschmitz> yeah still would be nice to get ie8 to play nice too
[09:44:17] <toddmparker> did you add all the rules from that first paste?
[09:44:32] <toddmparker> display, width, maybe float:left too?
[09:44:48] <toddmparker> anyway, this is a big improvement
[09:45:02] <toddmparker> nobody is running WP7 which is based on IE7
[09:45:42] <toddmparker> i.e. 9 understands media queries, but not below that
[09:45:44] <arschmitz> yes i added them all
[09:45:52] <arschmitz> oh right thats why it dosent work
[09:46:17] <toddmparker> well, these styles to stack shouldn't be in a MQ
[09:46:36] <toddmparker> i think we start with these as the base styles and add a MQ to make it look like a table
[09:46:45] <arschmitz> its in the media only all
[09:46:51] <arschmitz> ok
[09:46:56] <arschmitz> just a sec ill update it
[09:46:59] <toddmparker> riiight
[09:46:59] <toddmparker> @media only all
[09:47:11] <toddmparker> we use that to hide styles from non MQ browsers
[09:47:15] <toddmparker> ok, so that's fine
[09:47:27] <toddmparker> works in IE9 which was the main thing I wanted
[09:47:44] <toddmparker> older IE isn't being used at narrow widths for the most part
[09:47:51] <arschmitz> so in ie7-8 do you want table or stacked?
[09:48:07] <arschmitz> because it just depends where i place the rule
[09:55:31] <arschmitz> toddmparker: once you decide on default or ie7 let me know and ill push the changes
[10:00:16] <toddmparker> i think it's best to tuck these into the all MQ as it is now
[10:00:27] <toddmparker> that way, we know you have the chops to make it into a table
[10:00:36] <toddmparker> arschmitz ^
[10:00:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker: sounds good
[10:00:53] <arschmitz> want me to go ahead and push?
[10:05:23] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: do you foresee any issues with these css changes?
[10:06:41] <toddmparker> testing iOS and android
[10:09:01] <toddmparker> arschmitz: reflow page on your server looks good on iOS6, Kindle Fire HD, Android 4.1
[10:09:08] <toddmparker> WP7.5
[10:09:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker: awesome at least its a pretty easy fix
[10:11:30] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i checked on android 2.3.7 and ios5 and it seemed good
[10:18:12] <toddmparker> yeah, let's land this in master. it'll help us test
[10:18:24] <arschmitz> ok ill do it right now
[10:19:41] <_|Nix|_> Ladies and gentlemen, we might have a problem. AFAICT our events aren't getting defined against the git version of core, which means they won't work with the next version of core ... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5312 ...
[10:20:16] <_|Nix|_> Core has removed .data( "events" ) and they might've made other changes too ...

[10:22:36] <toddmparker> much easier that way, eh?
[10:22:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: My first major contribution was nearly a disaster. When I merged the popup branch, I swiftly undid, like, a week's worth of changes on master. Fortunately I managed to recover fairly quickly thanks to the help from on Linus Torvalds.

[10:23:53] <mspisars> now arschmitz is just showing off!
[10:24:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yes _|Nix|_ : NOOOOO!!! 
[10:24:47] <_|Nix|_> OK, so we have officially adopted the convention: Portion of the code: Summary of changes. Fixes issue #nnnn.\n\nDetailed description of changes.
[10:25:04] <arschmitz> mspisars: you caught me! i left those spaces out intentionally the first time MUAH HA HA HA 
[10:25:04] <_|Nix|_> Looks like.
[10:25:26] <mspisars> :)
[10:25:43] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, I'll try to figure it out, but it's my first dive into event definition territory.
[10:39:28] <_|Nix|_> OK, well, the events may be there, but $.fn.touchstart(), $.fn.touchend(), etc. are definitely not there.
[10:42:20] <_|Nix|_> OK, so it looks like the $.fn.<eventname>() functions aren't getting defined.
[10:42:43] <_|Nix|_> Otherwise, the events are fine ...
[10:47:18] <_|Nix|_> OK, the scale of the problem seems to be going down all the time ... the $.fn.<eventname>() functions are there, but the unit tests aren't picking them up.
[11:05:37] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: good it's not a huge thing
[11:08:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah.
[11:08:44] <_|Nix|_> So, with jquery git doing reloadLib does not result in any XHRs, whereas with the released version it does.
[11:09:55] <_|Nix|_> Meaning that reloadLib is somehow broken when used with jquery git.
[11:10:23] <toddmparker> good question for DaveMethvin 
[11:10:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Well, I'm not done tracking it down yet.
[11:10:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: If it's something core has changed on purpose then we have to adapt.
[11:11:00] <toddmparker> sure
[11:11:13] <toddmparker> he just might know the backstory
[11:11:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Otherwise we may have found a bug in core,.
[11:11:29] <DaveMethvin> whatsup _|Nix|_ toddmparker
[11:11:38] <DaveMethvin>  $.fn.<eventname>() functions aren't getting defined.
[11:11:41] <DaveMethvin> ?
[11:11:45] <toddmparker> DaveMethvin: stop breaking our stuff, mkay?
[11:11:50] <DaveMethvin> no way!
[11:11:57] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Not when we're reloading the library that defines them.
[11:11:58] <toddmparker> pretty please
[11:12:17] <DaveMethvin> i think you made the change to look whether $.attrFn was defined, right?
[11:12:24] <DaveMethvin> so that should work on all versions of jquery core
[11:13:10] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/unit/event/event_core.js#L35
[11:13:37] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: With the released version of core, the reloadLib results in script loads. With the git version, it does not.
[11:14:10] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: The script loads are supposed to redefine the $.fn members deleted by the previous $.each ...
[11:14:12] <DaveMethvin> oh well that sounds like something different
[11:14:26] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: I know. I haven't tracked it down completely.
[11:14:42] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: The fact is, the git version of core is causing /something/ /somewhere/ to behave differently.
[11:14:58] <DaveMethvin> well that's what code changes are all about, DUH :P
[11:15:02] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Maybe requirejs cannot handle the new version of core.
[11:15:21] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: I am not yet squarely blaming core.
[11:15:32] <DaveMethvin> i am not sure what this test is doing
[11:15:47] <DaveMethvin> we did change a bunch of stuff so i'd like to know what this is doing that we broke
[11:16:00] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: It deletes a bunch of $.fn.<eventname>()s and then reloads the libraries that are supposed to define them.
[11:16:16] <DaveMethvin> oh using requirejs?
[11:16:20] <_|Nix|_> Yes.
[11:16:41] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: That's what the $.each in the middle does.
[11:16:48] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: It loads all our event-related libs.
[11:16:53] <_|Nix|_> s/loads/reloads/
[11:17:13] <DaveMethvin> okay so the magic is in reloadLib
[11:17:28] <DaveMethvin> where might i find that?
[11:17:32] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Probably not, because reloadLib is an exceedingly simple function.
[11:17:40] <DaveMethvin> NOTHING is simple!
[11:17:42] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: tests/jquery.testHelper.js
[11:18:02] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/jquery.testHelper.js
[11:18:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah got it
[11:21:13] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: I'm wondering if we could reproduce this issue like this: <script src="something.js"></script><script>/* delete a $.fn.something defined in something.js */</script><script src="something.js"></script>
[11:21:33] <DaveMethvin> i'm pretty sure it's related to this commit from yesterday: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/e889134058232c5e19156353c5fc3bf3b4915a94
[11:22:39] <DaveMethvin> so is reloadLib re-appending a new script tag but leaving the old one in?
[11:23:42] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Looks like, yeah.
[11:23:56] <DaveMethvin> also its just doing an ends-with selector
[11:24:21] <DaveMethvin> so if you wanted to load abc.js but also had 123abc.js it would load them both at once i think
[11:24:35] <toddmparker> jeepers, that's quite a diff
[11:25:05] <DaveMethvin> but the ?count param would prevent it from being loaded again?
[11:25:15] <DaveMethvin> because now it ends with abc.js?count
[11:25:21] <DaveMethvin> which would never match
[11:25:36] <DaveMethvin> we used to strip scripts and not leave them in
[11:25:40] <DaveMethvin> i think that's why this used to work
[11:25:51] <DaveMethvin> it never found the newly injected script tag
[11:25:54] <DaveMethvin> now it will
[11:26:45] <DaveMethvin> i guess the logic behind cloning the script tag is that it may have charset or other attributes?
[11:28:06] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: I think the idea is to prevent a cached copy from being loaded by appending query parameters.
[11:28:38] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: So, every time the script tag is loaded, it is actually re-fetched.
[11:29:11] <DaveMethvin> libName is something like "jquery.event.js" ?
[11:29:15] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: ... and that's exactly what I was seeing with the released version of core. Requests being issues.
[11:29:20] <_|Nix|_> s/issues/issued/
[11:29:27] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Lemme check ...
[11:29:43] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Yeah.
[11:30:10] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: In particular: events/touch.js, events/throttledresize.js, events/orientationchange.js
[11:30:10] <DaveMethvin> okay, as long as the original script tag doesn't have anything afte rthe file name that shoudl work
[11:30:37] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Good point. Lemme check.
[11:30:55] <DaveMethvin> well it used to work so that's probably the case
[11:32:00] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: That is indeed the case. The scripts do not originally have any query params.
[11:32:17] <DaveMethvin> i think as long as that's true this should work
[11:32:24] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: ... and I can check the length of that selector ...
[11:32:33] <DaveMethvin> let me see if i can run those unit tests hwere
[11:32:34] <DaveMethvin> here
[11:33:37] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: It does match initially.
[11:33:49] <DaveMethvin> yeah, and cloning should work
[11:34:01] <DaveMethvin> is this a branch i can check out and try locally?
[11:34:44] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: It's master, but you need to replace js/jquery.js with one you build from core's master.
[11:34:58] <DaveMethvin> got it
[11:35:08] <DaveMethvin> what's the url i should use?
[11:35:34] <toddmparker> for our master js and css?
[11:35:46] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: After running make inside the jquery mobile source root, run this: TEST_PATH=event JUNIT_OUTPUT=build/test-results/ ROOT_DOMAIN=http://localhost/nix/jqm/jquery-mobile/ node_modules/.bin/grunt test
[11:35:55] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: You need to have phantomjs installed.
[11:36:40] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Replace ROOT_DOMAIN with the location on your local HTTP server of the jquery mobile source root.
[11:36:53] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Make sure the pathname ends in a slash. It's important.
[11:38:10] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: no test targets found
[11:38:35] <DaveMethvin> oh duh
[11:41:10] <DaveMethvin> okay i've got the right fails now _|Nix|_
[11:41:16] <DaveMethvin> yay!
[11:44:01] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Awesome!
[11:44:17] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: is there a way to run this in a browser so i can debug it?
[11:44:25] <DaveMethvin> http://localhost/jquery-mobile/tests/unit/event/ passes for me
[11:44:41] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Wow, OK, with core from git?
[11:44:48] <DaveMethvin> or local
[11:45:01] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: In chrome, you can open that URL.
[11:45:28] <DaveMethvin> oh strange, it passed before but now it fails
[11:45:35] <DaveMethvin> must have been cached
[11:51:42] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: OK, so what I'm seeing is that reloadLib works correctly, however, the code inside the script that is being injected is not being run.
[11:52:13] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: I placed a debugger; statement here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/events/touch.js#L10 and it is not reached when the script is re-injected.
[11:52:22] <DaveMethvin> yeah i'm hanging out in that area of the code
[11:52:33] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: ... with the release version of jQuery it is being reached.
[11:52:54] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Perhaps the define() function behaves differently with jQuery git.
[11:56:39] <DaveMethvin> okay i think this is what is going on _|Nix|_
[11:57:02] <DaveMethvin> we are trying to avoid re-executing scripts that litter the document
[11:57:05] <DaveMethvin> but leave them in place
[11:57:13] <DaveMethvin> so they are flagged as already being executed
[11:57:33] <DaveMethvin> when the same script is reinjected it thinks the script doesn't have to be executed
[11:57:41] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Wow, OK ...
[11:58:07] <DaveMethvin> the whole issue of jamming script interspersed with html has been a problem since day one
[11:58:25] <DaveMethvin> b/c if you for example .wrap() something that has a script we don't want to re-execute it
[11:58:43] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Yikes! That's true!
[11:58:43] <DaveMethvin> so let me create a simpler test case and see if i can repro
[11:59:32] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Has this behaviour been added recently?
[11:59:43] <DaveMethvin> yes, just yesterday :D
[11:59:52] <DaveMethvin> fresh enough for you?
[12:00:06] <DaveMethvin> so this probably worked earlier in the week?
[12:04:29] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Yep.
[12:05:03] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: So, is there a method by which we can indicate that we wish to be re-executed no matter what?
[12:05:49] <DaveMethvin> well you could use $.getScript() perhaps? I want to be sure I understand this issue completely though so i'm looking at it
[12:06:34] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: OK. Not bad. I guess it doesn't matter how we achieve the reload as long as we achieve it.
[12:07:52] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: I'm assuming we were using this method because this achieved our goal. If, however, $.getScript() is the canonical way of (re)loading a script, then we need to use that, and we'll likely have a cleaner DOM to boot.
[12:09:07] <DaveMethvin> yeah, depending on how much you reinsert scripts you probably don't want to leave them in the dom like that
[12:09:15] <DaveMethvin> them tags start to pile up
[12:10:06] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: yeah, but I think we'd want to do this synchronously, because we check for the presence of the $.fn. functions in the same frame that we delete them.
[12:10:44] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: So, looking at http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript, I think we'll need the $.ajax equivalent.
[12:11:09] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: ... with synchronicity set to true.
[12:11:53] <DaveMethvin> but _|Nix|_ the original was async
[12:12:42] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Injecting a script tag causes the script to be loaded asynchronously? If so it's weird that it worked.
[12:12:53] <DaveMethvin> oh nope, it was sync
[12:13:05] <DaveMethvin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L365
[12:13:28] <DaveMethvin> dunno why i remembered it being async
[12:13:46] <DaveMethvin> probably b/c it is such a bad idea to block :D
[12:13:52] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:14:11] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: OK. I'll try this with $.ajax instead of script tag injection.
[12:14:41] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: If you hear blood-curdling screams in a few hours that means I've had a minor setback :)
[12:14:49] <DaveMethvin> haha
[12:16:04] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: if you're done with DaveMethvin, I have a Q on popup
[12:16:11] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Thanks for your help!
[12:16:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Shoot!
[12:16:40] <toddmparker> ok, just working on sketching out the panel API
[12:16:50] <toddmparker> and noticed that popup doesn't emit a create event
[12:16:58] <toddmparker> all other widgets do
[12:17:08] <toddmparker> seems we should add that for consistency
[12:17:38] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ ^
[12:18:51] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It emits popupcreate ... 
[12:19:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: All widgets emit <widget>create, not create.
[12:19:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The widget factory takes care of that.
[12:19:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: If someone adds content to a popup dynamically it's up to them to enhance it.
[12:19:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Just like for any content you insert dynamically.
[12:20:24] <toddmparker> so all our docs say "create"
[12:20:34] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dialog/events.html
[12:20:56] <toddmparker> so are these incorrect? if so, we need to update our docs because all the forms say "create" too
[12:21:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and that's true, because all our docs also say that you should attach with .widget( { create: function() {} } );
[12:21:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: They are not wrong.
[12:22:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The widget factory provides two ways of attaching events: $div.widget({ create: function() { } }) or $div.widget().bind( "widgetcreate", function() {});
[12:22:37] <_|Nix|_> I guess the latter is provided by core, not the widget factory.
[12:22:51] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I don't like the former because it mixes events and options.
[12:23:33] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: However, the former allows one to use the unprefixed string "create" rather than the real name of the event which is "widgetcreate" ...
[12:24:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, popup does emit "create" the same way that all widgets emit create: prefixed with the widgetname.
[12:24:33] <toddmparker> so we just don't have that in the docs?
[12:24:48] <toddmparker> it's confusing that we say "create" when it's really widgetcreate
[12:25:17] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I know. Blame the widget factory.
[12:25:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: *shrug*
[12:25:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Confused me too.
[12:25:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: You can use create, as long as you attach with .widget( { create: function() {} } );
[12:26:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, if our documentation calls the event "create", it must also show that attaching to it is to be done with .widget( { create: function() {} } );
[12:27:13] <toddmparker> $( ".selector" ).bind({
[12:27:13] <toddmparker>    create: function(event, ui) { ... }
[12:27:15] <toddmparker> });
[12:27:15] <toddmparker> 	
[12:27:20] <_|Nix|_> Nono ...
[12:27:20] <toddmparker> so is that wrong?
[12:27:25] <_|Nix|_> That is wrong.
[12:27:32] <toddmparker> that is copied from the dialog docs
[12:27:41] <_|Nix|_> If you use bind, you must also use the name "<widget>create"
[12:27:44] <jlembeck> $( selector ).widget({ create: function(){} });
[12:27:48] <toddmparker> i think all these events are documented wrong
[12:28:01] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK. That is wrong, and I might've actually perpetrated that.
[12:28:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The "fruits" of my confusion.
[12:28:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... if I did so perpetrate.
[12:28:26] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: no, this was from dialog
[12:28:26] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/dialog/events.html
[12:28:29] <toddmparker> not popup
[12:28:35] <toddmparker> popup doesn't mention create at all
[12:29:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The problem is that, since we have inheritance, we shouldn't document all inherited functionality, because we'd have to duplicate all that for each widget.
[12:29:09] <toddmparker> seems like text input is correct tho
[12:29:09] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/textinputs/events.html
[12:29:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We should provide a link back to the widget factory's documentation.
[12:29:43] <toddmparker> in the UI docs, they document everything
[12:30:03] <toddmparker> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/
[12:30:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Exactly. The documentation for create/<widget>create should exist in only one place and it should not be copied over to all our widgets.
[12:30:25] <toddmparker> they do that in ui
[12:30:26] <toddmparker> http://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#event-create
[12:30:26] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Instead, all our widgets should link back to that one place where the documentation can be found.
[12:30:36] <toddmparker> that way everything is clearly listed per widget
[12:30:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yes, but everything is also duplicated as many times as there are widgets.
[12:31:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: But fine, let's duplicate. After all, we duplicate all our navigation menus - or used to, in the old docs.
[12:31:43] <jlembeck> If we can find a way to automate that, it won't be bad at all.
[12:31:47] <toddmparker> right. the ui docs seem really clear so i'd rather use that style
[12:31:51] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Amen!
[12:31:52] <jlembeck> Also, it's helpful for new people.
[12:31:56] <toddmparker> right
[12:32:18] <jlembeck> toddmparker: if you'd like, I can write something for that.
[12:32:19] <toddmparker> so _|Nix|_ would yo mind checking around to see if we've missed things?
[12:32:40] <toddmparker> jlembeck: yeah? 
[12:32:50] <toddmparker> might be helpful, even as a checklist of agcolom 
[12:33:01] <toddmparker> she has to write docs in a  specific xml format
[12:33:05] <jlembeck> shouldn't be too rough, if we were just going to link back, now we can have something that pops out a little template
[12:33:11] <jlembeck> ooo
[12:33:14] <toddmparker> ya
[12:33:28] <jlembeck> pretty sure I can make that work still. WIll check it out
[12:33:52] <toddmparker> maybe it's just dialog and popup that are off. 
[12:34:00] <toddmparker> is this one right? http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/slider/events.html
[12:34:13] <toddmparker> refs the widget
[12:34:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It is correct.
[12:35:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The grammar is wrong though: "The slider plugin has the following custom event:"
[12:35:13] <toddmparker> ya
[12:35:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker:  ... and then it goes on to list multiple event/s/
[12:35:35] <toddmparker> so it seems that we need to document create for popup
[12:35:39] <toddmparker> and fix the dialog one
[12:36:53] <_|Nix|_> Indeed ...
[12:37:18] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: mind doing that quickly?
[12:38:14] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK.
[12:38:42] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: one more thing I was wondering about. popup has "popupafteropen" and "popupafterclose" - should these just be open and close?
[12:39:00] <toddmparker> and just explain that these are fired once they are fully open and close?
[12:39:07] <jlembeck> is there a popupbeforeopen?
[12:39:15] <toddmparker> like UI's dialog: http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/
[12:39:32] <toddmparker> jlembeck: no
[12:39:37] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/events.html
[12:39:46] <toddmparker> just popupbeforeposition
[12:40:27] <toddmparker> UI's dialog has beforeClose but not beforeOpen
[12:40:31] <toddmparker> hrm
[12:41:01] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: the reason I ask is panels will have create, open, and close events
[12:41:03] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: There is.
[12:41:22] <toddmparker> maybe that just needs to be added to the docs?
[12:41:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I want to make sure that the event name conveys its semantics.
[12:41:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I think open and close are too vague, when the process of opening is not atomic, but involves several asynchronous steps.
[12:42:08] <toddmparker> i see
[12:42:11] <toddmparker> ok
[12:42:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and similarly for close.
[12:42:28] <toddmparker> but if there are other public events, i'd document them
[12:42:44] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: OK, right ... it used to be popupbeforeopen, but I renamed it, because the same event is used when repositioning.
[12:43:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: All are documented.
[12:43:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... for popup, at least.
[12:43:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Pushing "create" now.
[12:43:41] <toddmparker> gotcha, i thought you were saying earlier that there was another but that's the popupbeforeposition event
[12:43:49] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: thanks
[12:44:15] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_, uGoMobi, arschmitz, johnbender, etc. - starting to sketch out the panel API for jlembeck 
[12:44:16] <toddmparker> http://oksoclap.com/C1Lv3eBfTF
[12:45:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The dialog docs are correct. At least the XML docs are. They list the event as "create", and provide no example code for attaching to the event.
[12:45:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Neither does slider, and neither does popup.
[12:47:14] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: sorry, for what?
[12:48:08] <toddmparker> the docs on /test/ have code samples
[12:49:15] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'm talking about the API docs. I thought we were getting rid of the old docs.
[12:49:18] <jqcommit> [13api.jquerymobile.com] 15gabrielschulhof pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/rTi9Kg

[12:49:52] <toddmparker> oh, we are. the current docs will jus the around for a few weeks
[12:50:12] <toddmparker> so if the api docs are fine, then that's the important thing
[12:50:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: They are, but they don't mention that one must attach with .widget( { create: function() {} });
[12:50:41] <toddmparker> i see: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/popup/#event-create
[12:51:00] <toddmparker> the code examples there are correct 
[12:51:21] <toddmparker> those are way better than the old docs
[12:51:23] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Woah! Cool! Never actually seen that site until now.
[12:51:28] <toddmparker> fire alarm averted
[12:51:31] <toddmparker> no?
[12:51:38] <toddmparker> this is all agcolom 
[12:51:42] <toddmparker> it's amazing.
[12:51:52] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: "triggered when a slider is create" ... :-S
[12:51:56] <toddmparker> that's why I want to drop our old API docs - these are so much better
[12:51:57] * _|Nix|_ hides under a large rock
[12:52:15] <toddmparker> heh
[12:52:39] <toddmparker> we all need commit access so we can update things for agcolom 
[12:53:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We don't all have commit access?

[12:53:19] <toddmparker> we should, I do and you do too apparently
[12:53:22] <toddmparker> good :)
[12:54:16] <toddmparker> ok, not sure who's here but I added a markup example to : http://oksoclap.com/C1Lv3eBfTF
[12:54:21] <arschmitz> i do
[12:54:31] <jlembeck> Looks like I have the commit access as well
[12:55:36] <toddmparker> cool
[12:55:55] <toddmparker> so for panel API stuff
[12:56:08] <toddmparker> "mode" - push or overlay
[12:56:14] <toddmparker> that name make sense?
[12:56:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Cool ... 
[12:56:35] <jlembeck> makes sense to me
[12:57:04] <toddmparker> one question I had is how this should behave on larger screens
[12:57:04] <arschmitz> toddmparker:sounds good to me
[12:57:19] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: How much code duplication with popup do we incur with the overlay option?
[12:57:41] <toddmparker> on a tablet/desktop screen, I wonder if it could make sense to have the panel open and stay open like in a mail app
[12:57:44] <jlembeck> _|Nix|_: I was juuust looking at that. I'm not sure how much there will be yet.
[12:57:52] <jlembeck> if there will need to be any.
[12:58:04] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: i don't think much
[12:58:12] <toddmparker> this just some simple css
[12:58:14] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Can you dismiss an overlay by clicking outside of it?
[12:58:28] <toddmparker> yes, it's an option
[12:58:37] <toddmparker> i'm using "dismissible" to match popup
[12:58:48] <toddmparker> though in this context, that name feels odd
[12:58:49] <jlembeck> toddmparker: so at a certain viewport width, just have the panel show?
[12:58:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... then the screen will face the same issues and will have to implement the same tricks as popup's screen.
[12:59:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: All that resize-one-pixel-less-than-the-document-height-or-else-android-will-freeze crap et. al.
[12:59:53] <toddmparker> if it turns out to be the case, we can always abstract out the click out to close code as a utility and share it
[12:59:58] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Maybe we should make the popup screen an internal utility used by both widgets.
[13:00:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, I thought slightly bigger, but OK.
[13:00:24] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: here, we don't need a visible modal screen
[13:00:47] <toddmparker> so I wonder if we could just close the panel if you tap on a non-panel element
[13:00:53] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: popup's screen is not visible, but it does trap events.
[13:01:08] <toddmparker> right, but that may not be the only way to do it
[13:01:35] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: you need to prevent that element's own reactions to events.
[13:01:37] <toddmparker> or we look at the modal screen as an option
[13:02:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Hmmm ... I wonder if you were to add ui-disabled to the content div ...
[13:02:35] <toddmparker> look at his demo: http://jquerymobile.com/branches/SlidingPanel/docs/content/content-overflow.html
[13:02:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and to the header div, and to the footer div ...
[13:03:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Guess it doesn't work in FF yet.
[13:03:18] <toddmparker> the issue I see is on larger screens where 50-80% of the screen is the content, not panel, the push effect feels odd
[13:03:30] <toddmparker> and the tap content to close even odder
[13:03:42] <toddmparker> try chrome
[13:03:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Did. Works.
[13:04:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, well, if there is no screen, then there are no screen-related tricks that need to be implemented.
[13:04:15] <toddmparker> cool
[13:04:34] <toddmparker> so imagine the tap content to close behavior was here
[13:04:35] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and at that point it also diverges essentially from popup.
[13:04:40] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yeah
[13:04:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Then I'd use a popup.
[13:05:00] <toddmparker> feels kinda odd because the push effect is somewhat lost on larger screens
[13:05:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/popup-panels.html could be made to work.
[13:06:36] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: that demo isn't super reliable for some reason
[13:06:53] <toddmparker> but maybe it could be re-worked
[13:07:26] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Of course. OTOH, I suspect the popup would start having to do too much. Maybe as a popup extension ...
[13:07:28] <toddmparker> we could have a 3rd mode that pushes below ~600px, then above that, the panel makes the content re-flow so it's part of the page
[13:08:07] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: the code for this is pretty light so i'd rather have this be standalone
[13:08:15] <toddmparker> it just toggles a few classes really
[13:08:19] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... even now I'm thinking that popup might benefit from being broken into more extensions.
[13:08:32] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK *shrug* ...
[13:08:39] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Wait - does it have nav support?
[13:08:49] <toddmparker> scott had a demo that used collapsible for the same feature
[13:08:57] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: not right now
[13:09:01] <jlembeck> _|Nix|_: that's the big diff, no nav support
[13:09:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK, well, when you add it, it's time to rip it out of popup and make it a behaviour.
[13:09:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: In time, we might even move dialog to use the same behaviour.
[13:09:30] <toddmparker> johnbender is working on exposing a history hook in nag to make any widget part of the stack which we could hook into later
[13:09:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, that's good.
[13:09:54] <toddmparker> that should work for popup, selects, dialogs
[13:10:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah. I've always hated that popup has to poke into the guts of nav.
[13:10:26] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... only to replicate what nav already does for dialogs.
[13:11:14] <toddmparker> right, that should be a generic thing
[13:11:18] <toddmparker> eventually
[13:11:35] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Absolutely. In the glorious future.
[13:11:41] <toddmparker> :)
[13:11:50] <toddmparker> ok so "mode" sounds ok?
[13:12:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Actually ...
[13:12:03] <toddmparker> next: "direction" - left or right
[13:12:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: mode might be too generic a word.
[13:12:27] <arschmitz> panel-mode
[13:12:40] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Just like data-type="horizontal" is waaay too generic for controlgroup.
[13:12:47] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... but we're stuck with that now.
[13:13:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Should've been orientation or arrangement or something.
[13:13:08] <toddmparker> well, the options are implicitly associated with the widget
[13:13:24] <toddmparker> prefixing the widget on every option name seems like it will add a lot of bloat
[13:13:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: or open-mode ... or something like that
[13:13:42] <toddmparker> data-listview-theme vs. data-theme
[13:14:01] <toddmparker> the reason i was using mode was we used that for the tables
[13:14:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: data-appear='push/overlay'
[13:14:13] <toddmparker> so we'd need to re-consider there too if that seems too generic
[13:14:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: data-enter='push/overlay'
[13:14:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: data-display='push/overlay'
[13:14:58] <toddmparker> i like that better than the other two
[13:15:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Which than which other two?
[13:15:24] <toddmparker> display over appear or enter
[13:15:37] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Yeah, I'm gravitating towards display myself.
[13:15:52] <toddmparker> hmmm, tricky one to name
[13:15:58] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Yaaay! unit tests passed with $.ajax() for script reloading.
[13:16:01] <jlembeck> data-display works, but considering the use of that is straight tied to the data-rel
[13:16:02] <toddmparker> not quite position 
[13:16:22] <jlembeck> it doesn't seem like we'd need the prefix...
[13:16:27] <DaveMethvin> thanks for checking that _|Nix|_
[13:16:31] <toddmparker> brb
[13:16:34] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: "straight tied to the data-rel" -- huh?
[13:17:18] <jlembeck> sorry. The use of data-display, in this case, is dependent upon what data-rel is... example: data-rel="panel" data-display="overlay"
[13:17:53] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: That looks fine.
[13:18:44] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: popup also has options that can be present both in the popup definition /and/ the link that opens the popup.
[13:18:45] <jlembeck> I feel like data-mode works the same way in this case
[13:19:07] <jlembeck> hrm
[13:19:08] <jlembeck> nevermind
[13:19:10] <jlembeck> display works better
[13:19:14] <jlembeck> a lot better
[13:19:36] <toddmparker> ok, updated the doc
[13:19:40] <toddmparker> to use display
[13:20:15] <toddmparker> jlembeck: i think data-rel="panel"
[13:20:17] <toddmparker> <a href="#IDofPanel" data-rel="panel">
[13:20:27] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: Yes, but mode is too generic. mode can also mean automatic/manual, straight/crooked, progressive/interlaced
[13:20:51] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: changed mode to display
[13:21:18] * _|Nix|_ lays off it :)
[13:21:30] <toddmparker> http://oksoclap.com/C1Lv3eBfTF
[13:21:36] <toddmparker> i also updated the code sample
[13:21:52] <toddmparker> so popups use data-rel="popup"
[13:22:01] <toddmparker> so data-rel="panel" is consistent
[13:22:32] <jlembeck> I like it, makes plenty sense
[13:22:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and data-rel has special meaning for nav, because it ends up in the pagebeforeshow data object as data.role = <whatever data-rel was in the link>
[13:23:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... oh, and avoid handling click yourself to open the panel!
[13:23:32] <toddmparker> the link has the display, direction, and dismissible attar so you can have multiple links pointing to the same panel, each with different options
[13:23:40] <toddmparker> how popup works too
[13:23:41] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Go through nav and capture pagebeforechange.
[13:23:59] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: right
[13:24:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I recently had to yank out custom select's click handling because it was a disaster on android.
[13:24:38] <toddmparker> the href points to the ID of the panel and the rel tells the script to basically toggle the visibility of the panel for you
[13:25:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Opening by intercepting and stopping pagebeforechange ensures that the mouse event storm has passed by the time you open, so you don't get any superfluous mouse events.
[13:25:12] <toddmparker> as jlembeck suggested, this should toggle
[13:25:51] <toddmparker> does the click need to go that far into the page change sequence at all?
[13:26:09] <toddmparker> how does collapsible work? seems more parallel than how popup works
[13:26:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Collapsibles are not overlayed.
[13:26:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: You never open a collapsible by clicking an element that ends up covered by the collapsible.
[13:26:53] <toddmparker> so you're talking about the tap out to close, not how it opens
[13:27:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: No, I'm talking about how it opens.
[13:27:19] <toddmparker> ?
[13:27:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The select had a bug where, after it opened, an item was highlighted for some reason.
[13:27:48] <toddmparker> the current demo isn't nearly that complex
[13:27:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It turned out that the item was receiving the focus because of a mouseup that belonged to the select's button.
[13:27:55] <toddmparker> don't think it needs to be
[13:28:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: If you're going to be covering the button that opens you, expect events from that button.
[13:28:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's the truth on Android.
[13:28:57] <toddmparker> sure. but on collapsibles, i think we just bind to click to avoid that wackiness
[13:29:23] <toddmparker> we flip the button to the active state on touchend to give some more immediate visual feedback
[13:29:28] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: ... and you're fine, because the button doesn't move because of the click.
[13:30:09] <toddmparker> when we used click originally, it was opening and closing itself or triggering clicks on the contents
[13:30:17] <toddmparker> sorry, vclick
[13:30:34] <toddmparker> because things shifted around
[13:31:07] <toddmparker> i'm sure we'll grind through all these oddities as we get this built
[13:31:18] <toddmparker> i just wanted to confirm a few more things...
[13:31:34] <toddmparker> "dismissible" - is there a better name for click outside to close?
[13:32:18] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Oh no - is "dismissable" correct, or "dismissible"?
[13:32:40] <toddmparker> typo, fixed
[13:32:55] <toddmparker> just wondering if there is a better term for that
[13:32:59] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Neither version is in m-w.com
[13:33:08] <jlembeck> It's dismissible
[13:33:08] <toddmparker> ideally, one we could use for this and popup
[13:33:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The word isn't on wiktionary either. We are finding ourselves on the bleeding edge of the English language.
[13:34:27] <toddmparker> hee
[13:34:34] <toddmparker> let's just mull that one over
[13:34:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'd've gone for modal, but that's inaccurate since you can still dismiss it with "Back".
[13:34:57] <toddmparker> yeah
[13:34:59] <toddmparker> tricky
[13:35:02] <toddmparker> destroy - Wait until we add to add widgets in 1.4?
[13:35:03] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: data-cancel='true/false'?
[13:35:23] <toddmparker> data-tap-outside-to-close :)
[13:36:19] <jlembeck> toddmparker: is destroy an inherited quality in the widget factory?
[13:36:19] <toddmparker> arschmitz: opinion on destroy?
[13:36:32] <jlembeck> if not, it might be good to get something going now for it, and just don't make it public
[13:36:46] <arschmitz> destroy is a public widget factory method
[13:36:50] <arschmitz> all widgets have it
[13:36:52] <toddmparker> yeah. it's somethign all ui widgets have and we lack
[13:36:58] <arschmitz> _destory is called internally 
[13:37:02] <arschmitz> by destroy
[13:37:04] <jlembeck> gotcha.
[13:37:13] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: The widget factory promisses that widgets derived from it will clean up after themselves when the element they were triggered on is removed.
[13:37:26] <_|Nix|_> s/promisses/promises/
[13:37:28] <arschmitz> you should include _destroy() i
[13:37:29] <jlembeck> perfect.
[13:37:41] <toddmparker> cool.
[13:37:48] <arschmitz> its best to do it when you make the widget i think rather then add later
[13:37:56] <jlembeck> agreed.
[13:38:03] <arschmitz> and since this is a new widget there is no chance of it breaking anything so i say do it now
[13:38:08] <toddmparker> +1
[13:38:20] <toddmparker> need to figure out convention to close panels via a link - popups and dialogs use data-rel="back" but they use history so data-rel="close" for panels?
[13:38:20] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: After _destroy() executes, all the elements you've created must be gone, and all the ones you've moved to another place in the DOM must be put back to where you grabbed them from.
[13:38:45] <toddmparker> close is also the method you'd call
[13:38:53] <_|Nix|_> jlembeck: After putting them back, you must strip off all classes and attributes you've added, and you must restore the values of those attributes you've modified.
[13:39:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker: jlembeck: also if you want to follow ui  make sure refresh and setOption work correctly
[13:39:27] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: A tought one, because nav is involved when you click on a ling.
[13:39:31] <jlembeck> so everything returns to as it was prior to modifications.
[13:39:39] <arschmitz> jlembeck: exactly
[13:39:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I've changed nav so it passes you the jQuery object containing the link.
[13:39:49] <jlembeck> interesting. gotcha.
[13:40:05] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: so that's why to open or close, we need a system to grab that event and prevent the nav from doing it's thing
[13:40:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, you can add jqmData() to it even, and receive that.
[13:41:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The system is simple: hook up to pagebeforechange and prevent default if the link that was clicked is the link that's supposed to close the panel.
[13:41:26] <toddmparker> seems simple enough
[13:41:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Look at the popup code. It uses pagebeforechange to open the popup.
[13:42:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The same thing can be used for both opening and closing the panel.
[13:42:37] <toddmparker> ok
[13:42:49] <toddmparker> so the only question is what the data-rep is on these
[13:43:10] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L857
[13:43:13] <uGoMobi> back
[13:43:20] <toddmparker> to open (toggle really): data-rel="panel"
[13:43:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: "panel" sounds good.
[13:43:35] <toddmparker> on a close button you add to your panel, data-rel="close"?
[13:43:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: arschmitz : does table reflow css for IE9 stilll need attention?
[13:43:50] <uGoMobi> or is it fixed?
[13:43:52] <toddmparker> i just want to avoid "back" since we're not touching history now
[13:44:05] <arschmitz> its fixed but could use another set of eyes to make sure it wont potentially cause problems
[13:44:11] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: cool, that will help jlembeck 
[13:44:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok, I'll take a look
[13:44:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:its already in master
[13:45:09] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: yep, arschmitz landed that
[13:45:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw you committed changes
[13:45:15] <toddmparker> i tested it and it looks solid
[13:45:19] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:45:27] <toddmparker> but look for potential gotchas
[13:45:30] <uGoMobi> I'll just take a look at the commi
[13:45:31] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi 
[13:45:37] <uGoMobi> *commit
[13:45:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Actually, data-rel=back would be OK if https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3136 were fixed.
[13:45:51] <toddmparker> we're reviewing the panel API - http://oksoclap.com/C1Lv3eBfTF
[13:47:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, if johnbender lands the nav refactor before we release the panel, we might actually be able to go with data-rel=back ...
[13:47:47] <toddmparker> that would be ideal, tho i think that history stuff wont' happen until 1.4
[13:47:54] <toddmparker> so close or back for now?
[13:48:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I'd go with close-panel ... 
[13:48:31] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: "close" is too generic.
[13:48:31] <toddmparker> agreed
[13:48:47] <jlembeck> gives us the ability to just put that button anywhere as well
[13:48:49] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Later on, we can support both "back" and "close-panel".
[13:49:11] <toddmparker> well, that's in interesting question
[13:49:39] <toddmparker> if i wanted to have a random button somewhere outside of the panel, could we support that?
[13:49:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: How do you mean?
[13:50:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: toddmparker: hopefully I'll get some work done on that this weekend
[13:50:13] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Do you mean a button that closes the panel that itself lies outside of the panel?
[13:50:17] <johnbender> so close
[13:50:19] <toddmparker> yep
[13:50:26] <toddmparker> johnbender: awesome
[13:50:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, you are aware of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3136?
[13:50:32] <toddmparker> <a href="#id-of-panel-to-close" data-rel="close">
[13:50:39] <johnbender> just need to add in a way to prevent default on the event early (beforenavigate or something)
[13:50:55] <toddmparker> seems similar to the pattern we use to open popup and panels
[13:50:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: nope
[13:51:01] <johnbender> but that's not fun :(
[13:51:07] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It would be good to issue a pagebeforechange before issuing $.mobile.back()
[13:51:21] <toddmparker> the href specifies what and rel the action (kinda)
[13:51:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: that way going back behaves the same way as following a link.
[13:51:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... in that it's preventable, browser history and all.
[13:52:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Currently we issue $.mobile.back() from the click handler, so people do not have a chance to prevent going back via preventing default on pagebeforechange.
[13:54:15] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: which click handler, for anchors?
[13:54:24] * johnbender goes to look
[13:54:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, The click routing in nav.
[13:54:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yap there it is :(
[13:54:44] <johnbender> weak
[13:54:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: :) I like your reaction :)
[13:54:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's a feature request though
[13:55:01] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, it is to be data-rel=close after all.
[13:55:07] <johnbender> hmm
[13:55:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It is, but it makes a lot of sense.
[13:55:12] * johnbender thinks about his last statement
[13:55:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: haven't thought about that just yet
[13:55:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Going back results in a pagebeforechange just as following a link.
[13:55:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: so they're complaining that going back fires a pagebeforechange?
[13:55:59] <johnbender> jesus
[13:56:00] <johnbender> I need to read this ticket
[13:56:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nono.
[13:56:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: toddmparker we have to add a clearfix or overflow: hidden to give the table height
[13:56:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah but data-rel="close" wouldn't fire the pagebeforechange?
[13:56:27] <johnbender> err
[13:56:27] <johnbender> would
[13:56:31] <johnbender> ?
[13:56:39] <johnbender> let me read the ticket lol
[13:56:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: They're complaining that, when going back, they can prevent the page change from occuring, but they cannot prevent the browser history from going back.
[13:56:55] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good catch i didnt think about that 
[13:57:07] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: good point
[13:57:13] <toddmparker> gotta love ie
[13:57:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and that's because we issue $.mobile.back before we emit the pagechange.
[13:57:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm
[13:57:25] <johnbender> I'd have to think how we would do that
[13:57:36] <johnbender> actually
[13:57:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I offer two solutions in the ticket.
[13:57:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... and there's a PR, but I think that one's hairy.
[13:58:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't see anything from you in the ticket
[13:58:21] <johnbender> in the pr maybe?
[13:58:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4179
[13:58:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Sorry, it's there, not in the original ticket.
[13:58:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah.
[13:59:06] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I agree that we shouldn't monkey around with history like that if we can avoid it
[13:59:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: do we care about making this work on IE7?
[13:59:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Absolutely *shudder*
[13:59:36] <uGoMobi> this = table reflow
[13:59:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we know it dosent work
[13:59:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: so here's a thought for you
[14:00:02] <johnbender> this doesn't solve the problem
[14:00:03] <uGoMobi> I think we should leave it
[14:00:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that was what we decided also
[14:00:20] <johnbender> we bypass the hashchange handler in the click handlers
[14:00:24] <johnbender> by calling changepage directly
[14:00:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok good :)
[14:00:32] <arschmitz> lack of MQ makes it pretty much impossible
[14:00:42] <johnbender> because we have to with transition attributes etc
[14:01:04] <johnbender> but it would be interesting to put that navigation on the other side of call to the $.navigate event i'm building
[14:01:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[14:01:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that would make the whole thing more consistent
[14:01:44] <uGoMobi> it works fine on wp7.5
[14:02:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup :)
[14:02:10] <uGoMobi> I could check how it looks on IE7/8 with respond.js
[14:02:15] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, if I understood correctly, then I also had that thought: namely, that we might affect browser history as the last step in the page change process, rather than the first stop.
[14:02:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the reverse
[14:02:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: wp7.5 was why we realized it needed the change
[14:02:54] <johnbender> let the hashchange handler always be the way we handle navigation
[14:02:56] <uGoMobi> you know what... let's just forget about IE7/8
[14:03:15] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: obviously it's hashchange/popstate but my changes normalize those two to navigate
[14:03:24] <uGoMobi> should be fine on desktop screen
[14:03:34] <arschmitz> yeah anyone on ie 7/8 just gets default table layout
[14:03:35] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But then people would never have a chance to prevent a nav event.
[14:04:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If we modify browser history before asking people whether they want the page change prevented or not ...
[14:04:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: they would, as it's built in my branch now, never have a chance to prevent the change of the url
[14:04:15] <johnbender> but there's no reason we can't prevent that
[14:04:19] <johnbender> new event or something
[14:04:24] <johnbender> beforenavigate for example
[14:04:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. Great!
[14:04:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: WORKSFORME.
[14:04:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and chance are anyone on 7/8 will be on a full size monitor
[14:04:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: well
[14:04:57] <johnbender> I'm going to finish it the way I have it now
[14:05:01] <johnbender> and we can think about that later
[14:05:05] <johnbender> it's already taken too long 
[14:05:11] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah that's what I meant so we don't need to look into it
[14:05:18] <uGoMobi> dunno about wp7
[14:05:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: but that would be a big simplification
[14:05:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Definitely.
[14:05:39] <uGoMobi> is suppose most wp7 devices are updated to wp7.5
[14:05:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If there's a single entry point into navigation, then we can ask that question before entering.
[14:05:54] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: bingo
[14:06:13] <johnbender> consolidation is the key to a lot of our troubles
[14:06:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: suposedly wp7 supports media queries so it should work
[14:06:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: true
[14:06:43] * _|Nix|_ nods to the point of developing whiplash
[14:06:48] <uGoMobi> can't test wp7
[14:06:55] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: toddmparker: ok I need to take a quick nap, I've been up since 5am
[14:07:02] <toddmparker> i think all WP are 7.5 now
[14:07:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Good stuff! Take it easy!
[14:07:16] <toddmparker> an i agree that i.e. 7/8 can get a table, they will be desktop
[14:07:28] <toddmparker> i gotta head out, but feel free to edit that api doc
[14:07:34] <toddmparker> happy thanksgiving all
[14:07:43] <toddmparker> i'll check in as much as i can 
[14:07:48] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That's right! Happy thanksgiving :)
[14:07:55] <uGoMobi> goodnight toddmparker and happy thanksgiving!
[14:07:59] <jlembeck> later toddmparker
[14:08:02] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: And bon apetit!
[14:08:14] <toddmparker> bye all!
