[06:56:58] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06bug-5619-fixedtoolbarpadding 14493229c 15Scott Jehl: the first argument of updatePagePadding is expected to be a page, but when it is called from the throttledResize binding, it ends up as an event object, and the padding was being set on that instead of the page. This adds a check to ensure the arg is a page before setting its padding. This is a fix for #5619
[07:39:37] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: can you confirm this fix? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5619#issuecomment-15641912
[07:40:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: was just looking at it
[07:40:03] <toddmparker> that fiddle still looks broken but i can't tell if it's using latest
[07:40:08] <uGoMobi> will test it and comment
[07:40:16] <toddmparker> how the heck do you view full source in jsfiddle?
[07:40:51] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I really don't know... that's why I never use it
[07:40:54] <toddmparker> lots of little panes of info
[07:41:00] <uGoMobi> copy and paste in JS Bin :)
[07:41:06] <toddmparker> heh
[07:41:34] <uGoMobi> I also notice that people that posted JSFiddle test page were using 1.3 beta 1
[07:42:20] <toddmparker> jquery.mobile-1.3.0-rc.1.min.js Remove
[07:42:20] <toddmparker> jquery.mobile-1.3.0-rc.1.min.css
[07:42:30] <toddmparker> ^^ that fiddle isn't using latest
[07:42:44] <toddmparker> there is an 'external resources' collapsible on the left
[07:43:03] <toddmparker> how would you set the meta view port or any other head items in a fiddle? boo.
[07:44:22] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/iqubug/2
[07:44:33] <toddmparker> doesn't seem to update on resize
[07:45:00] <uGoMobi> have to test this on FF
[07:45:07] <toddmparker> tho it's not designed to update on resize, is it?
[07:45:14] <uGoMobi> Chrome doesn't update anything that's in a MQ :(
[07:45:15] <toddmparker> thought it was just on show
[07:45:24] <toddmparker> right. stupid broken chrome
[07:45:28] <uGoMobi> yeah
[07:46:05] <uGoMobi> we do call updatePagePadding after throttledresize 
[07:48:07] <toddmparker> oh, cool
[07:48:13] <toddmparker> so that is just chrome being dumb
[07:48:55] <toddmparker> tho that example isn't re-calculating if FF either
[07:54:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: just tested on FF with Scott his fix and it works
[07:56:51] <scottjehl> hio
[07:56:55] <uGoMobi> hey scottjehl 
[07:57:03] <uGoMobi> just tested your fix on FF
[07:57:15] <uGoMobi> it does resolve the issue
[07:57:17] <scottjehl> if you guys were testing that bug I had a page you could drop into the demos dir
[07:57:18] <scottjehl> sorry about that
[07:57:37] <uGoMobi> oh I just used a JS Bin
[07:57:54] <scottjehl> cool. I'm unsure why we'd want to pass an event as the arg - that was probably a mistake, ya?
[07:58:05] <uGoMobi> I remember we merged a PR from Maurice G. that changed the updatePagePadding logic
[07:58:26] <uGoMobi> I will take a quick look at the history
[07:58:42] <scottjehl> looked like a change Gabriel made. Not sure
[07:58:56] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_ around?
[07:58:57] <uGoMobi> oh ok, that was probably after that PR
[07:59:26] <uGoMobi> just wanted to test the issues that were fixed by the changes made to see if there is no regression
[07:59:31] <scottjehl> anyway, it looked to me like we always reference the same "page" within that method, so I was unsure why it needed to be passed as an arg
[07:59:46] <scottjehl> sure sounds great
[08:00:02] <uGoMobi> I guess the commit message wasn't clear about that
[08:02:01] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: ha, that button issue
[08:02:31] <uGoMobi> ah the anchor with a label
[08:03:01] <uGoMobi> it actually passes the W3C validator
[08:03:44] <uGoMobi> people that use JQM seem to be very creative :)
[08:05:12] <gseguin> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Release-Instructions-Checklist#how-to-release-with-grunt-starting-at-13-stable
[08:05:47] <gseguin> toddmparker: do you have the keys to code.jquery.com?
[08:06:57] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: such an odd pattern
[08:07:05] <toddmparker> gseguin: i don't believe it do
[08:07:23] <toddmparker> it would be good to give scottjehl and maybe jlembeck keys
[08:07:41] <toddmparker> me, not so much
[08:07:44] <gseguin> gnarf, ryanneufeld: ^
[08:08:27] <gseguin> If I'm not mistaken, right now johnbender and me have them
[08:11:05] <scottjehl> js bin added https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5619#issuecomment-15644892
[08:15:04] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: scottjehl posted this jsbin, looks good even on chrome - http://jsbin.com/ozurob/1
[08:16:20] <uGoMobi> great
[08:17:44] <scott_gonzalez> What is https://github.com/jquery/jquerymobile-demos ?
[08:23:55] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: that looks stale, but I would wait for johnbender to vet removal
[08:24:19] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks gseguin. Will do.

[09:00:01] <scott_gonzalez> So is it not used anymore?
[09:00:13] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: it's not being changed anymore that's for sure
[09:00:25] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I'm actually unclear what the state of our website is
[09:00:26] <scott_gonzalez> So the one open issue for logging can be closed?
[09:00:33] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: absolutely
[09:00:35] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[09:01:04] <scott_gonzalez> I'm more concerned about getting our organization issue count down than actually getting rid of the repo.
[09:01:18] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: I'm sure we can get rid of it soon
[09:01:23] <scott_gonzalez> We can deal with the repo itself after we've moved all of the jQuery Mobile sites to the new system.
[09:01:33] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: we're moving to the new site arch pretty soon right?
[09:01:38] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: got it
[09:01:40] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[09:01:43] <scott_gonzalez> Thanks johnbender

[09:01:58] * johnbender is ashamed
[09:02:22] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Heh, don't worry. This repo isn't anywhere close to being the worst offender.
[09:02:28] <scott_gonzalez> There were actually only 2 open issues.
[09:02:33] <scott_gonzalez> Even though they were both 1 year old.
[09:02:54] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: that whole setup was a nightmare, I did my best to leave it alone
[09:03:53] <scott_gonzalez> Heh, I wish the UI demos weren't sourced from jquery-ui.
[09:04:06] <scott_gonzalez> It really sucks not being able to update demos without a code release.

[15:37:35] <johnbender> toddmparker: the refactor?
[15:37:35] <toddmparker> All those refactor commits :)
[15:37:40] <johnbender> toddmparker: ah yes
[15:37:42] <toddmparker> Yar
[15:37:48] <toddmparker> How goes?
[15:37:53] <johnbender> toddmparker: trying to get it done so I can deal with the base tag stuff starting monday
[15:37:57] <johnbender> toddmparker: it's basically done
[15:37:59] <johnbender> toddmparker: just adding tests
[15:38:07] <johnbender> toddmparker: thinking about renaming some methods after that
[15:38:10] <johnbender> but that's basically it
[15:38:21] <toddmparker> Super
[15:38:22] <johnbender> toddmparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/tree/transition-handler-refactor/js/transitions
[15:39:14] <toddmparker> Like the re-org
[15:39:31] <johnbender> toddmparker: not sold on "visuals" but I didn't know what else to call it
[15:39:36] <johnbender> "fallbacks" is sort of wrong
[15:39:43] <toddmparker> Hmm
[15:39:43] <johnbender> even though that's all that's in there
[15:40:03] <johnbender> those are mostly to associate the css
[15:40:44] <toddmparker> Yeah. CSS dep. and fallback
[15:41:01] <toddmparker> But they are kinds the individyal transition definitions
[15:51:17] <johnbender> toddmparker: if it bother people we can always change it :)
[15:51:20] <johnbender> *bothers
[15:51:26] <johnbender> I doubt anyone will care too much
[15:51:47] <johnbender> about the directory/meta-module name
[15:51:49] <johnbender> that is
