[07:11:54] <dmaco> Hi guys,
[07:12:15] <dmaco> Is it possible to add your own custom icon image to the jquerymobile button http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a4.1/#docs/toolbars/../../docs/pages/../../docs/buttons/index.html
[11:29:31] <Eddiemonge> Did I miss the meeting today or are we skipping it?
[11:31:29] <gseguin> I think we skipped
[11:31:42] <gseguin> I haven't seen Todd this morning on IRC
[11:32:22] <Eddiemonge> Ok then I'll get back to my learning
[14:03:36] <gseguin> kinblas: ping
[14:33:09] <toddparker> sorry everyone!
[14:33:21] <toddparker> my irc was disconnected and i spaced out on our checkin
[14:33:34] <toddparker> scott and i have been working on transitions
[14:33:46] <toddparker> making some good progress, frustrating for sure
[14:56:36] <gseguin> why does .ui-disabled have an !important ?
[15:06:22] <gseguin> toddparker: ^^^ any idea?
[15:10:28] <kinblas> gseguin: pong
[15:10:36] <gseguin> hey Kin
[15:10:46] <kinblas> hey sorry I've been in meetings
[15:10:50] <gseguin> no worries
[15:10:53] <kinblas> whassup?
[15:10:56] <gseguin> why does .ui-disabled have an !important ?
[15:11:02] <gseguin> do you know?
[15:11:03] <kinblas> ew
[15:11:13] <kinblas> what file is that in?
[15:11:17] <kinblas> theme?
[15:11:19] <gseguin> yeah
[15:11:55] <gseguin> I believe it is the cause of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1816
[15:13:09] <gseguin> The reason I see is to make it look ok on a desktop browser
[15:13:33] <gseguin> is there such a thing as a cursor on a mobile device?
[15:14:21] <kinblas> lol
[15:14:26] <kinblas> oh yeah there is
[15:14:37] <kinblas> on BB torch for example it has a nub
[15:14:42] <kinblas> that when you touch it, a cursor appears
[15:15:09] <kinblas> so I think one of the reasons is because theme is included first?
[15:15:17] <kinblas> perhaps it should be last
[15:16:00] <kinblas> this would be more of a toddparker/scott question
[15:16:23] <kinblas> but given the fact that theme.css is included first, anything after it with equal specificity would trump it
[15:16:33] <gseguin> oh that's right :(
[15:16:37] <kinblas> so if you wanted to make sure it was disabled
[15:16:42] <kinblas> you would have to use !important
[15:16:53] <kinblas> we should be avoiding !important when we can though
[15:17:09] <kinblas> I'm not sure why themes is included first
[15:17:26] <gseguin> me neither
[15:17:30] <toddparker> hi guys
[15:17:30] <kinblas> toddparker: why is themes.css included before the other structural CSS?
[15:17:40] <toddparker> you mean in the order of the compressed css?
[15:17:45] <gseguin> yeah
[15:17:46] <kinblas> yeah
[15:17:56] <kinblas> in the Makefile and index.php the themes.css is included first
[15:18:45] <toddparker> so the theme is first because we actually override those styles on a per widget basis
[15:19:19] <toddparker> like we will set the border color and thickness in the theme, then shut off the top border in widget x
[15:19:48] <toddparker> scott said we could flip this if there was a good reason
[15:19:59] <toddparker> but it would be a bigger change
[15:20:10] <gseguin> the good reason is to not use !important
[15:20:20] <toddparker> we agree with that for sure
[15:20:38] <gseguin> but we can find other ways like more specific slectors
[15:20:57] <toddparker> that would be preferrable
[15:21:07] <toddparker> or test to see if we really need it
[15:21:14] <gseguin> in my case the !important int .ui-disabled is causing https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1816
[15:21:15] <toddparker> what is the style block?
[15:21:31] <gseguin> *int = in
[15:22:24] <toddparker> we agree that it's probably fine to just take this important off
[15:22:24] * gseguin has no idea what css has to do with dom events
[15:22:38] <toddparker> not worth causing ios issues for a cursor
[15:23:06] <gseguin> so the thing is, if we take that !important out, we might as well get rid of the rule
[15:27:25] <kinblas> Looking at existing cursor rules I think removing the !important might be ok
[15:27:55] <kinblas> only the select has most specific rules for cursor, but they are on the select
[15:28:05] <kinblas> all others like btn use a single class selector
[15:28:29] <kinblas> while the rule in quesiton is contextual ".ui-disabled a" which would be more specific
[15:34:39] <gseguin>  alright, removing it
[15:41:34] <gseguin> kinblas: Can you land https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1841 ?
[15:41:45] <kinblas> landed
[15:41:50] <gseguin> thank you!
[15:41:57] <kinblas> no... thank you!
[15:41:58] <kinblas> :-)
[15:44:45] <gseguin> kinblas: Can you close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1816 as well, please?
[15:46:35] <kinblas> gseguin: Oh you can't close it?
[15:46:42] <gseguin> nope
[15:47:18] <gseguin> I guess the access control lacks granularity on github
[15:47:41] <gseguin> I can't get assigned issues
[15:47:54] <gseguin> that's why there is a Ghislain tag
[15:48:02] <kinblas> done
[15:48:46] <gseguin> thank you
