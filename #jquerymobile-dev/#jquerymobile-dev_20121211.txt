[03:20:15] <Changsuk> Hello, Todd.
[03:20:37] <Changsuk> This is my test connection with IRC client tool.
[03:33:14] <Changsuk> Can you see my message?
[03:34:43] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: yes
[04:09:40] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Nice to meet you. :) Is that your nickname?
[04:11:25] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: hi, nice to meet you too. Yeah, I use uGoMobi here and on Github... my name is Jasper
[04:14:13] <Changsuk> Ok, I see. Did you hear about me from Todd?
[04:15:57] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: to be honest, no I didn't
[04:16:28] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: toddmparker asked you to join us at the dev channel?
[04:17:21] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Yes, he told me this channel to join. :)
[04:17:37] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: cool... welcome!
[04:18:10] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: where are you from?
[04:18:58] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: We're emailing thease days for my team to contrbute jquery-mobile project.
[04:19:15] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: from Korea.
[04:19:31] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: nice!
[04:19:48] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: I am from Amsterdam, The Netherlands
[04:20:02] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: the Americans are still asleep ;-)
[04:20:09] <Changsuk> Ah ha, I see.
[04:20:17] <Changsuk> Yes I think so.
[04:21:06] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: I'm sorry that I can't be used to IRC. pls understand. :)
[04:21:42] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: no problem
[04:21:51] <uGoMobi> you are doing fine
[04:22:39] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Thanks for understanding me~. I work for S-core a Samsung company and my team develop Tizen Web widgets using jQuery and jQuery Mobile.
[04:23:38] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: Oh that's cool! I am really curious about Tizen
[04:23:54] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: So, I contact Todd and discuss about my team's contribution.
[04:24:00] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: Did you attend the jQuery Asian conference?
[04:24:12] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: I understand
[04:24:33] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: One of my team went the conference.
[04:25:00] <Changsuk> So I got Todd's email from her. :)
[04:25:08] <uGoMobi> right
[04:26:34] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: Alex (arschmitz) will probably be here soon... he presented at the Asia conference
[04:27:09] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: and Gabriel (_|Nix|_) might be around as well. He is from Finland and works for Intel
[04:28:33] <uGoMobi> I am not sure if _|Nix|_ is working on Tizen for Intel
[04:28:42] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Ah ha~, I see. I think there are many members in jQM project around world~
[04:30:22] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Jasper, I'm sorry that I'll go home. It's 9:30 pm in Seoul... And thanks for introducing the members to me. :)
[04:30:51] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: and I'll connect again one of these days.
[04:31:00] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: no problem... again, nice meeting you and I will see you around
[04:31:11] <uGoMobi> Changsuk: have a nice evening!
[04:31:22] <Changsuk> uGoMobi: Have a nice day~!! :)
[04:31:28] <uGoMobi> thank you
[04:57:09] <arschmitz> Hi changsuk
[04:58:06] <arschmitz> morning uGoMobi:
[04:58:19] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:17:50] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15tempelton opened issue #5360: mobile Slider BUG and SammyJs  #2  02http://git.io/Ud26nQ
[05:23:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: dont you love it when someone opens an issues thats an exact duplicate because we closed thir old one?
[05:23:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that Sammy guy
[05:23:58] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:24:00] <arschmitz> yup
[05:24:09] <uGoMobi> I just saw it
[05:24:36] <arschmitz> i already closed the first one sammy manipulates that hash never gonna work and he says hes disabling all that stuff but his fiddle has none of those settings
[05:25:00] <arschmitz> well time to close as a duplicate lol :)
[05:29:20] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15uGoMobi opened issue #5361: Persistent toolbars broken  02http://git.io/v4c0Qg
[05:32:21] <uGoMobi> :D
[05:34:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what we the status of the changes to swipe?
[05:34:59] <uGoMobi> did you land a fix?
[05:35:05] <arschmitz> swipe was merged already
[05:35:20] <arschmitz> well not a fix exactly but made it so you could extend it
[05:35:25] <arschmitz> we are not going to fix
[05:35:30] <uGoMobi> ok
[05:35:42] <uGoMobi> if you check this demo http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/swipe/swipe-list.html
[05:35:56] <uGoMobi> you get swipe left/right events on scroll
[05:36:06] <arschmitz> yes thats the bug
[05:36:07] <uGoMobi> on Android at least
[05:36:18] <arschmitz> we are not going to fix it though
[05:36:19] <uGoMobi> and we are not going to fix that?
[05:36:23] <uGoMobi> i see
[05:36:28] <uGoMobi> because we can't?
[05:36:33] <arschmitz> no but you can use an extension to do it
[05:36:53] <arschmitz> we can but we would have to calculate scroll top on every touchmove
[05:36:57] <uGoMobi> so there will be a fix, but in an extension?
[05:37:16] <uGoMobi> that sounds very expensive
[05:37:26] <arschmitz> yes thats why we are not going to fix
[05:37:34] <uGoMobi> i understand
[05:37:59] <arschmitz> hold on ill give you a link to the extension.
[05:40:15] <arschmitz> https://github.com/arschmitz/JQM-Swipefix/blob/master/swipefix.js
[05:41:50] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks!
[05:43:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem let me know if you notice anything weird with it i only did really really basic testing on iphone only
[05:44:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok I will add it to the demo and see if the fix works and what it does to performance
[05:47:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it should be fine for a demo but on like really long lists with a lot of items bound to it it might become an issue
[06:06:49] <_|Nix|_> Huh? What? Intel/Tizen-related stuff?
[06:07:10] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Did you have a question about Intel and/or Tizen?
[06:09:12] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: I worked on web-ui-fw.
[06:09:20] <_|Nix|_> Changsuk: Still working on it, although there's currently not much to do.

[07:03:58] <toddmparker> morning
[07:04:43] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Hey!
[07:06:41] <arschmitz> morning toddmparker
[07:07:09] <toddmparker> hey arschmitz and _|Nix|_ 
[07:07:15] <toddmparker> is Changsuk still here?
[07:07:39] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: thanks for chiming in there and making Changsuk feel welcome
[07:07:57] <uGoMobi>  hi toddmparker 
[07:08:02] <uGoMobi> sure, np
[07:08:11] <toddmparker> so yeah, we have some Samsung folks who are interested in working with us so you may see them around. Not sure of specifics yet.
[07:08:16] <uGoMobi> no Changsuk went home... late night in Korea already
[07:10:15] <toddmparker> i bet
[07:10:29] <arschmitz> 14 hour difference makes it hard lol
[07:10:33] <toddmparker> timezones…we just need to fill out the time with more people around the world so we're 24/7
[07:10:42] <toddmparker> team, not time
[07:11:16] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: I bet it's somehow related to web-ui-fw ... they grabbed a snapshot of that in, like, February for tizen.
[07:11:29] <toddmparker> ah, wondering how that worked
[07:11:49] <_|Nix|_> "The sun never sets on jQuery Mobile." -- paraphrased ;)
[07:12:03] <toddmparker> they said they have some widgets to share…the issue is always with us committing to support them and when
[07:12:29] <toddmparker> i had a similar conversation with Tiggzi where they have jQuery Mobile plugins they want to contribute
[07:13:03] <toddmparker> I wonder if we could/should make a separate repo for 3rd party widgets that companies want to contribute but that we're not supporting officially
[07:13:09] <toddmparker> at least they would have a home
[07:14:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker: incross the sponsors of the jquery asia conference wanted to contribute widgets too but everyone told them basicly the same thing that commiting to supporting them was hard and that they should set them up and we would link to them.
[07:15:30] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We could support them insofar as hosting them in GH under jquery/<new-repo-name> and making a commit here and there, but we need not bundle them into jQM.
[07:16:18] <arschmitz> toddmparker: or is this really something for the plugins site when ever its finished?
[07:16:42] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It would give people a playground and it would hopefully make people realize just how difficult it is to support widgets across all our platforms.
[07:16:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: We could grab the most successful ones from there.
[07:17:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: It would be a good middle ground for fostering a wider community around the core jQM.
[07:17:27] <toddmparker> yeah, could be interesting
[07:17:40] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah, the plugin site will be helpful there too
[07:18:05] <toddmparker> i think the issue is some companies don't want to actually have GH repo for stuff, they just want to donate it
[07:18:24] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: That way, we take the pressure off would-be contributors in that they don't have to roll their own site, etc.
[07:19:34] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: If that's the case, the new repo will quickly become full of orphaned widgets.
[07:19:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: the only potential issue i see with something like that is who take responsibility for testing and approving these 
[07:20:17] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that could be a lot of work
[07:23:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: But, TBH, jQM's pace is pretty slow for product-oriented stuff. This is not a shortcoming, because jQM is a platform, but the new repo could be more product-oriented.
[07:23:21] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: The orphaned stuff would be cleaned out, and if the whole thing flops, we can shrug and say "Well, you've had your chance. Throwing code over the fence doesn't cut it."
[07:23:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I think those widgets will emerge.
[07:24:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Those who really want their widgets to become part of jQM will set up an infra similar to jenkins and will create a branch of jQM where their widget will be integrated.
[07:26:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then, they can point us to the logs of the buildbot and say "see, our widget has been playing nice with jQM for half a year now, and it's really popular and stuff, so c'mon - give it a chance!"
[07:26:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What I'm saying is that with such a repo we could take a hands-off approach and see what, if anything comes out of it.
[07:26:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but basically I think we need finer granularity than 1. Roll your own distro or 2. become a committer to jQM and make your stuff part of jQM.
[07:28:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: My experience with web-ui-fw has been exactly this. Basically we created a lot of jQM widgets for Tizen, and I tried to contribute some, but in the end, the popup was the only one that made it into jQM proper. The other guys working on web-ui-fw quickly lost interest when they saw that it's a toolkit in a vacuum, and they moved on.
[07:29:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, if we had a place where there would be a lot of code that was largely compatible with jQM but maintained by people other than ourselves, we could greatly increase the exposure of both projects.
[07:29:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's an example with GTK+, libsexy, and libsexier.
[07:30:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: libsexy started out as a widget library that was complementary to GTK+ (for example seach button inside the text field, etc.)
[07:30:24] <toddmparker> yeah, i am concerned with orphan code for sure, but I can see what _|Nix|_ 
[07:30:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Eventually, it was merged into GTK+, but not before libsexier showed up :)
[07:30:46] <toddmparker> is saying re: make a repo or wait for it to get into jQM
[07:31:02] <toddmparker> most widgets won't make the cut, or won't make it for years
[07:31:08] <toddmparker> but are still useful
[07:31:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i meant whos going to approve widgets to be added to this new repo of widgets we dont want to add just everything 
[07:31:14] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: 
[07:31:36] <toddmparker> what is the story with web-ui-fw? is it maintained?
[07:31:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: we would want to make sure they work to some extent 
[07:32:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Look at it this way: getting commit access to jQM should be harder than getting commit access to this new repo.
[07:32:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: So, if people wanna dump code over the fence, fine ... here's your commit access.
[07:32:22] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: You break the repo, we revert.
[07:33:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: There are no demands being placed on it, so there's not really much to do.
[07:33:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We could devote as much or as little time to it as we see fit.
[07:33:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: but with out someone watching and maintaining how do we know when it breaks and then try and investigate where to revert to
[07:34:23] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In the meantime, it would be a great source of people testing jQM and maybe even proposing the kinds of improvements one sees with a trained eye.
[07:35:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: to be clear im not saying i dont think something like this would be a really good idea i just think it will be a nightmare to maintain and will always be broken.
[07:35:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If it breaks, there will be a bug filed against that repo. If nobody else who has commit access fixes that bug, we may /eventually/ look at it.
[07:36:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We won't know until we try.
[07:36:25] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, gotta go for a while.
[07:36:27] <_|Nix|_> BBL
[07:37:21] <arschmitz> ok later _|Nix|_:
[07:39:37] <arschmitz> another option could be to get people to just setup their own repo and a jsbin to demonstrate and then have a page where we just genericly list everything. we could write a how to on setting this up. it requires no more effort to contribute then having them all in one repo but no worries about people breaking stuff or commit access 
[07:40:33] <arschmitz> its no harder to fork add widget and set up jsbin then it is to clone add widget and demo to a repo we create
[07:41:01] <arschmitz> toddmparker: _|Nix|_: when you get back ^^
[07:41:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker: _|Nix|_: then in our demo docs we have a 3rd party widget section linking to the repos and jsbins (or sites if they prefer);
[07:42:48] <arschmitz> toddmparker: _|Nix|_: and if we see one being popular or good we can add a demo directly to the demo docs like we are doing with a lot of things now
[07:43:21] <_|Nix|_> I'm actually back now, but I dunno for how long ...
[07:43:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's basically what we're saying now. The problem is that every company will set up their own and there won't be any interaction between different repos.
[07:44:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We want people from different companies working on the same repos.
[07:44:31] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah, separate repos is easier for sure
[07:44:31] <_|Nix|_> s/repos/repo.
[07:44:45] <toddmparker> maybe we just try to pimp these widgets via demos
[07:45:17] <arschmitz> if we do a demo of a third party widget we can add a link for issues to its issue tracker too
[07:45:26] <arschmitz> to the demo
[07:45:34] <toddmparker> i don't think we need to decide this now, but something to mull over. 
[07:45:45] <toddmparker> arschmitz: right
[07:45:46] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Definitely.
[07:46:27] <arschmitz> and maybe on the demo have a generic blurb about that this is a 3rd party widget and if you would like to get involved with it here is a link to its github to fork or contribute
[07:46:34] <toddmparker> maybe demos are the way to go…if someone is looking for a cool jQuery Mobile widget, if we listed it under demos and they could easily play with it, then link to the repo to fork it or log issues, be a nice way to elevate things
[07:46:59] <toddmparker> the plugin site won't have live demos so that's a difference here
[07:47:44] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i think demos is a great place for this it will give them max exposure being actually on our site and usable.
[07:47:47] <toddmparker> the issue I see if that a lot of these repos have no demos or docs and it's hard to say "show me this working and what css and js do i need to inlude"
[07:48:05] <toddmparker> if we cherry picked good widgets and had a demo page, that might be a nice lightweight start
[07:48:19] <toddmparker> right. exposure.
[07:48:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker: it would be cool to maybe even make a form to submit a demo. 
[07:48:49] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: I think the web-ui-fw stuff would be really popular if each plugin had a repo and instructions
[07:49:15] <toddmparker> might be worth picking the most useful ones and doing that. a repo per widget means that it can have a tracker and PRs
[07:49:17] <arschmitz> toddmparker: and we would require a link to a repo and a link to a basic demo we can copy just like a jsbin or something
[07:49:25] <toddmparker> right.
[07:50:17] <arschmitz> will also make it easy to give people credit for their work
[07:50:28] <toddmparker> arschmitz: might be cool to look at the resources page for 3rd party plugins and make demo pages in our template for the best ones. some aren't so good
[07:50:48] <toddmparker> we could use the count bubble on the list view to indicate it's a plugin
[07:51:07] <Wilto__> Morning, guys.
[07:51:07] <toddmparker> honestly, most people just want a simple list of all the widgets/utilities
[07:51:39] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah i was thinking a section in the demo docs "3rd party widgets" and just a big list of them 
[07:51:43] <toddmparker> if we had a flat, alphabetical list of all the unique widgets, might make it easier to shop of a widget
[07:52:02] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah, we could separate it out too
[07:52:21] <arschmitz> that way its a clear gallery of 3rd party stuff so people arnt confused
[07:52:35] <toddmparker> yeah, it would need to be clearly marked
[07:52:48] <arschmitz> maybe widgets isnt even the right word the because there are other types of extensions and such
[07:53:04] <arschmitz> 3rd party demos or something
[07:53:05] <toddmparker> right
[07:53:28] <toddmparker> there is another swipe list for delete button
[07:53:39] <toddmparker> could link that and your together (looks good btw!)
[07:54:00] <toddmparker> on your demo, the row you swipe should be active when the popup opens for feedback I think
[07:54:21] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: did kpepin connect with you on friday?
[07:54:35] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: no, I didn't see him
[07:56:50] <uGoMobi_> toddmparker: not sure if I saw all your feedback (IRC problems) but good idea to set active state on list item that will be deleted
[07:57:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker: when you have a minute i want to talk to you about an idea i had for responsive stuff
[08:00:22] <toddmparker> uGoMobi_: cool, active will help there. rat is good
[08:00:26] <toddmparker> arschmitz: sure
[08:01:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: remember i think 2 weeks ago in the meeting _|Nix|_: was talking about exposing MQ's to js to be able to initalize or destroy widgets or things like that
[08:01:33] <arschmitz> toddmparker: and if there was a way to do this.
[08:02:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think i thought up a fairly reliable way to do this with out much overhead for min-width and max-width which seem to be the 2 most commonly used ones
[08:04:17] <arschmitz> use a normal MQ to set the min and max width properties on a display:none div then check the properties useing .css() on throttled resize and pageshow
[08:05:54] <arschmitz> technically you could do it for any MQ not just min and max width but you would have to use some other css property and say this property / value = this MQ/value 
[08:28:24] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah, that is the approach we usually try to do. Have the CSS control things and use JS to detect properties and act accordingly
[08:28:51] <toddmparker> min/max is probably more than enough
[08:29:18] <toddmparker> this uses a similar technique: https://github.com/filamentgroup/AppendAround
[08:29:56] <toddmparker> in this case, it looks for which layout slot isn't display:none and moves content into that
[08:30:20] <toddmparker> throttled resize would be better
[08:31:15] <toddmparker> the issue that people are still going to run into is MQs act on the window, not layout things like the width of the main content area. but that's a different problem.
[08:34:00] <Wilto__> This is gonna shock you guys, but older versions of Internet Explorer can sometimes be a pain to work with.
[08:35:15] <toddmparker> nah.
[08:35:16] <arschmitz> Wilto__: iv told you to stop telling those dirty defamatory lies about IE everyone here knows IE is the best browser ever
[08:35:42] <Wilto__> It “sucks less,” I’ve heard!
[08:35:48] <Wilto__> From very reliable marketing firms.
[08:39:23] <arschmitz> toddmparker: might be cool to turn the concept into an event or something

[09:34:04] <Wilto__> Do we have a known issue with dialogs in IE9?
[09:37:35] <toddmparker> fired.
[09:37:37] <Wilto__> If I touched it last, that means I have to fix it. Doesn’t it.

[11:25:23] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06slide-panel-refactor 144fef31c 15Scott Jehl: trying out a push idea with float + table
[11:25:47] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: I did.
[11:26:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: Working on it.
[11:26:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: Chrome triggers a superfluous popstate when it starts.
[11:26:17] <johnbend1r> _|Nix|_: which branch
[11:26:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: simple-nav-merge
[11:26:30] <johnbend1r> brilliant
[11:26:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: I remember the current nav ignores that, because the state associated with the popstate is null/undefined/empty/whatever.
[11:27:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: However, the current implementation triggers a navigate, which in turn fires _handleHashChange.
[11:27:44] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: Not only that, but it unwinds the stack before firing navigate.
[11:28:00] <johnbend1r> _|Nix|_: that's by design
[11:28:02] <johnbend1r> that second bit
[11:28:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: I know. I looked at the code.
[11:28:30] <johnbend1r> _|Nix|_: does delaying the navigate binding until after dom ready make a diff?
[11:28:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: Nevertheless, as a result a changePage back to $.mobile.firstPage gets queued after a click to open a dialog has already been issued.
[11:29:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: Lemme check.
[11:32:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbend1r: I think we're already doing that. We have a deferred for when nav is ready, aptly named $.mobile.navreadyDeferred ...
[11:33:25] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hmmm ... but that does not include domReady ...
[11:33:33] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It gets resolved from 	$.mobile.navreadyDeferred.resolve();
[11:34:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I mean from init after mobileinit is fired.
[11:35:10] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I can attach another condition to it.
[11:39:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: that seems to fix it.
[11:39:27] <_|Nix|_> I'll run the whole suite again ...
[11:43:02] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool
[11:43:03] <bot-t> (12 hours 30 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender Your daughter is slightly younger than mine. Ours developed this problem at exactly the same time. Doctors here in Finland gave us such an inhaler as well.
[11:43:03] <bot-t> (12 hours 30 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender They said it's because her larynx hasn't fully hardened yet, and so it tends to expand when she sleeps. It's really scary and it can be dangerous (hence the inhaler), but it's supposed to go away by itself as they get older (~ age 3) and the larynx hardens into its permanent state.
[11:47:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hope she's doing better ...
[11:59:23] <ryanneufeld> Anyone got a sec to have their brain picked about the retina sprite?
[12:00:39] <ryanneufeld> I'm just wondering if I have to do anything special with the mediaquery as I've extended the sprite to add new icons
[12:01:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: she is, it's just some inflamation from the cold she's got
[12:06:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Glad to hear it!
[12:08:34] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The straight and the push-state-disabled sequence tests are good. Only the corner case ones are timing out/failing.

[12:13:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK.
[12:13:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We might be. I'm just going to concentrate on making the tests pass.
[12:13:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Good idea about the issue.
[12:14:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The nav tests themselves are run without $.testHelper.asyncLoad ... might wanna add that to the issue.
