[01:01:54] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Popup screen opacity 0 for IE7/8 - Jasper de Groot

[01:27:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That opacity filter is not working for me in IE8.
[01:27:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can still click and highlight the text behind the popup.
[01:45:19] <_|Nix|_> I acn see why some AUS company shows higher prices on their Web site to people browsing with IE ...
[01:45:24] <_|Nix|_> s/acn/can/
[01:51:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK ... made some progress ... as long as the background colour is set, the filter has an effect ...
[02:07:39] <_|Nix|_> Well, I'll be darned! It works! Even better than before - now I have half-opacity for all screens ...
[02:28:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!

[02:57:50] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[02:57:50] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #168: FIXED in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/168/
[03:31:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: sorry, I forgot the semi transparent
[03:33:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  just noticed black background when testing that issue that guy had with his selectmenu not opening the second time
[03:57:39] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: Shall we close this one since we established icons are displayed correctly on real BB devices and issue is only with the simulator? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3691
[03:57:39] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #3691 on jquery-mobile (indyEssl; 3m, 2w ago): Icons not showing on BlackBerry 5.0
[04:28:19] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... I don't get it ... the width of non-native select menus is enormous on IE8 ...
[04:36:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I dont see that when opening these menus http://jquerymobile.com/test/#/test/docs/forms/selects/custom.html
[04:58:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Strange. On my machine, the menu stretches from the left edge of the window to the right edge of the window, even though it doesn't need to.
[05:00:01] <_|Nix|_> But you're right - it behaves correctly when I access jquerymobile.com and it behaves incorrectly when I access my own server.
[05:00:38] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's quirksmode
[05:00:44] <uGoMobi> I see it now too
[05:00:54] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... what is the default?
[05:01:04] <_|Nix|_> Which one is correct?
[05:01:09] <uGoMobi> IE7 and IE8 in quirksmode show full width menus
[05:01:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, so do I need to fix anything? Do most people run them in quirksmode?
[05:02:09] <uGoMobi> normally they shouldn't run it in quirksmode but it can be that something on the site triggers IE to run it in quirksmode
[05:02:30] <uGoMobi> IE8 in quirksmode means render it as IE7 if I am not mistaken
[05:02:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aha, OK ...
[05:03:10] <_|Nix|_> Well, there are two different values listed in the developer tools: "Browser Mode" and "Document Mode" ...
[05:04:01] <uGoMobi> I don't really know what modes that are... compatibility view = quirksmode
[05:04:09] <_|Nix|_> But whatever ... after setting the value on my own server to be the same as on jquerymobile.com, it looks the same as on jquerymobile.com, and that's really all I care about.
[05:05:04] <_|Nix|_> Don't really care about IE anyway ...
[05:05:28] <uGoMobi> haha... I wish I wouldn't have to care about it at all
[05:05:57] <uGoMobi> I can't wait until the day we drop support for IE7 :-)
[05:06:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://tech.slashdot.org/story/12/06/14/0253237/aussie-online-retailer-impose-ie7-tax
[05:07:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wish amazon did this.
[05:08:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: haha I like that approach
[05:08:39] <_|Nix|_> Absolutely!
[05:09:06] <uGoMobi> I thought Google mentioned sometime ago they were going to support only two versions back
[05:09:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think they're too generous ...
[05:09:31] <uGoMobi> so when IE10 is final :-)
[05:10:01] <_|Nix|_> I think M$ should be punished for at least 15 years into the future for what they inflicted upon us for the past 15 years.
[05:10:21] <_|Nix|_> I don't care if it's IE29000 ...
[05:10:50] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:11:17] <_|Nix|_> Every Web site should be like: "Oh, I see you're running IE. GTFO!"
[05:13:08] <_|Nix|_> The funny thing is that M$ may have created a good browser in IE10, but all the Web development has hacks for IE, so Web sites are going to look like crap even in IE10, because all those hacks will be triggered.
[05:14:08] <_|Nix|_> ... unless M$ can make the test for IE fail in the case of IE10.
[05:14:33] <uGoMobi> yeah I was surprised by that performance cheat Paul Irish showed
[05:14:57] <uGoMobi> sheet*
[05:15:14] <uGoMobi> chart*  hahaha (i give up)
[05:15:50] <_|Nix|_> I haven't seen it, but, just out of curiosity, I'd love to see my popups running on IE10 ... I dunno if I can install it alongside IE8 though ... I don't wanna lose IE8, because it's Intel standard and whatever ...
[05:16:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  anyway... the full width menus on IE are caused by inline-block on the popup container
[05:16:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But inline-block is supposed to avoid exactly that.
[05:16:42] <uGoMobi> IE7 doesn't support inline-block
[05:16:53] <uGoMobi> so it renders as block
[05:16:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, I see, so it's set to block by default, eh?
[05:16:59] <uGoMobi> width = auto
[05:17:03] <uGoMobi> yup
[05:17:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, how can I get the effect of inline-block?
[05:17:35] <_|Nix|_> I think inline is no good, because the size of the container will be 0x0 then.
[05:17:37] <uGoMobi> i guess "float" but that is something we want to avoid as well
[05:17:45] <_|Nix|_> *bletch*
[05:18:12] <uGoMobi> yeah it needs to be some kind of block to give it width
[05:18:15] <_|Nix|_> I think the alternative to inline-block is "Oh, you're running IE7? GTFO!" :)
[05:18:21] <uGoMobi> hahaha
[05:18:56] <uGoMobi> redirect to google.com/chrome/download
[05:19:23] <_|Nix|_> That's too nice. I don't want to be nice to people running IE7 ...
[05:19:30] <_|Nix|_> :)
[05:19:45] <_|Nix|_> But it's probably the diplomatic thing to do.
[05:20:54] <uGoMobi> I am not sure if we should bother to change this
[05:21:06] <uGoMobi> as long as the content is displayed on the screen
[05:21:31] <uGoMobi> we might have to check what happens with other popups
[05:21:52] <_|Nix|_> Agreed.
[05:22:20] <_|Nix|_> It's OK, and I suppose IE7 ppl are used to having a distorted view of the Internet anyway.
[05:24:32] <uGoMobi> the popup examples in the docs are all displayed on the screen so I dont see an issue :)
[05:25:36] * _|Nix|_ washes his hands
[05:26:21] <uGoMobi> I think toddparker said all WP7 phones get an update to 7.5
[05:26:53] <uGoMobi> which is more an combination of IE8 and a bit of IE9
[05:27:17] <uGoMobi> I think we should more care about WP than IE7

[09:07:29] <uGoMobi> johnbender: but doesn't need to be fixed for 1.1.1 so if you have things with higher priority
[09:08:14] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it should be quick and I don't want to forget about it
[09:08:25] * johnbender doesn't like breaking things when he deprecates / refactors
[09:08:28] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok
[09:09:05] <uGoMobi> johnbender: i would have reminded you anyway ;-)
[09:10:46] <agcolom> uGoMobi, Hi, and yes, that was the one meant (last night message)
[09:11:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne
[09:11:26] <uGoMobi> agcolom: the issue is solved already :-)
[09:11:49] <agcolom> yes, I saw that... That's great... So what was missing? (img size?)
[09:11:59] <uGoMobi> yup
[09:12:14] <agcolom> that's crazy!
[09:12:32] <agcolom> But I was glad to see that was solved so quickly!
[09:12:54] <agcolom> btw, in the docs, I'm having doubts about something...
[09:13:17] <uGoMobi> shoot
[09:13:22] <agcolom> you know in switch and in sliders we have div name= id=
[09:13:35] <uGoMobi> yes
[09:13:49] <agcolom> now, in the docs, we had all names equal to slider
[09:13:57] <agcolom> but with exceptions.
[09:14:03] <agcolom> I like names to be unique
[09:14:16] <agcolom> so I gave all the names the same value as id
[09:14:23] <agcolom> is that ok or is that bad?
[09:14:27] <uGoMobi> yeah good idea
[09:14:35] <agcolom> good! Thanks!
[09:14:46] <agcolom> Suddenly I was having doubts!
[09:15:41] <uGoMobi> although it are just examples they have to be good practise
[09:15:49] <agcolom> Mission for the evening: help my don build a 3D model of the solar system (for his homework... he's 10)
[09:16:06] <uGoMobi> you dont use same name multiple times
[09:16:22] <agcolom> yes, I thought they are separate examples, and in each sliders are all separate so they should not have the same name...
[09:16:23] <uGoMobi> your son or your don? ;-)
[09:16:35] <agcolom> ooops! son ;-)
[09:16:58] <uGoMobi> how many planets?
[09:17:20] <agcolom> we're going for 9 (pluto as a dwarf planet)
[09:17:31] <uGoMobi> lol ok :-)
[09:17:38] <uGoMobi> good luck with that
[09:18:04] <agcolom> thanks ;-)
[09:18:24] <agcolom> johnbender: was that online XML editor the sort of thing you were after?
[09:18:40] <johnbender> agcolom: gah I didn't take a look
[09:18:47] <johnbender> agcolom: and I rebooted last night
[09:18:51] <johnbender> agcolom: do you still have the link

[10:40:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah, supporting the legacy options whilst doing the refactor without tests coverage was troublesome
[10:40:44] <gseguin> uGoMobi: so what are you saying?
[10:41:03] <gseguin> that the .live( "vclick" ) is not the way to go for IE ?
[10:41:49] <uGoMobi> geseguin: I am saying we looking for alternative for browsers that don't support pointer-events (IE and Opera)
[10:42:49] <gseguin> oh for all actions
[10:42:57] <uGoMobi> yup
[10:43:17] <uGoMobi> but i guess just leaving out the "a" selector does the trick
[10:43:34] <gseguin> that's what I'm thinking
[10:43:42] * gseguin tries it out
[10:43:48] <uGoMobi> and there is .live()
[10:43:54] <uGoMobi> vs. on()
[10:45:39] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ^^^ .delegat() ?
[10:45:45] <uGoMobi> delegate even
[10:45:46] <gseguin> well unless we drop support for 1.6.4 we'll use .live or .delegate
[10:46:05] <uGoMobi> .live() doesn't work in 1.7.1
[10:46:18] <uGoMobi> so .delegate() it is I guess
[10:47:05] <uGoMobi> gseguin: where do you put that function?
[10:47:15] <gseguin> no idea :D

[10:57:16] <toddparker> gseguin: should we not use your jive address?
[10:57:45] <gseguin> generally not, I don't check it very often as our product kinda replaces email

[13:25:44] <gseguin> uGoMobi: I found that: doing e.preventDefault(); e.stopImmediatePropagation(); was working
[13:26:14] <gseguin> so I'm thinking of installing the handler only if the pointer-events is not supported, what do you think?
[13:26:46] <uGoMobi> if that works it is even better
[13:30:25] <_|Nix|_> Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4419 Is there any notification about elements getting removed from the DOM? I don't think so, right?
[13:30:26] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #4419 on jquery-mobile (rid00z; 4w, 17h ago): Memory Leaks when dynamically loading
[13:31:29] <_|Nix|_> Does triggering "destroy" work similarly to triggering "create"?
[13:31:43] <_|Nix|_> i.e., does it end up calling _destroy() inside widgets?
[13:36:17] <_|Nix|_> I just found http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-empty-does-not-destroy-ui-widgets-whereas-jquery-remove-does-using-ui-1-8-4
[13:40:17] <_|Nix|_> So, I just checked and calling, for example, $( "body" ).empty() calls _destroy() on widget instances that have this function implemented. So, if any widgets do things like $( window ).bind( "someevent", function() {}); they need to be changed to implement _destroy() and remove those bindings at that time.
