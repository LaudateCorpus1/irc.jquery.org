[06:59:33] <toddparker> morning
[08:22:13] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[08:22:27] <toddparker> sounds like you're busy with some new hotness
[08:25:12] <kinblas> toddparker: hey
[08:25:30] <kinblas> toddparker: Jorge is out so I'm getting invited to meetings in his place :-)
[08:25:54] <kinblas> toddparker: I should have time for JQM today
[08:30:58] <scottjehl> hey
[08:36:38] <toddparker> yeah? cool
[08:36:46] <toddparker> how was the trip
[08:36:59] <toddparker> BTW - BEta 2 should go out today if all is well
[08:47:51] <kinblas> toddparker: trip was good ... was itching to develop something but had no time
[08:48:12] <kinblas> toddparker: was following progress through the blogs though
[08:48:42] <toddparker> blog is pretty handy to keep up to date, huh
[08:48:50] <kinblas> yeah
[08:48:52] <toddparker> also makes it super fast to do teh release posts
[08:48:56] <toddparker> copy, paste, done
[08:49:02] <kinblas> :-)
[08:49:24] <scottjehl> k I'm gonna push the symbian opt-outs into master unless anyone has objections?
[08:49:29] <toddparker> do it
[08:49:41] <toddparker> i'm testing our device now and it works
[08:50:02] <kinblas> scottjehl: more UA stuff eh? :-)
[08:50:12] <scottjehl> this will be the first, I believe
[08:50:38] <kinblas> I thought there was something for BB, but I may be mis-remembering
[08:50:48] <kinblas> or was it opera mini
[08:50:54] * kinblas shrugs
[08:51:13] <scottjehl> well, yeah we're targeting a fix at those through some host object detection
[08:51:16] <scottjehl> not ua
[08:51:21] <kinblas> ah
[08:51:49] <toddparker> nokia made us do some dirty things
[08:52:03] <scottjehl> still horrible...
[08:52:16] <gseguin> scottjehl: sorry you had to go there
[08:53:10] <gseguin> I bet you feel kindda dirty now :)
[08:53:16] <scottjehl> I just wish they had some other detectables to use here
[08:53:24] <gseguin> I know
[08:53:33] <scottjehl> ua makes me nervous for so many reasons
[08:53:47] <scottjehl> but, if this fails, the back button breaks. It's not like it'll be a blank page
[08:54:10] <scottjehl> minor opt-outs based on UA seem a little more okay than flat redirection or something
[08:54:13] <scottjehl> ok... anyway
[08:54:48] <gseguin> scottjehl: no objection for landing
[08:55:01] <kinblas> scottjehl: none from me
[08:55:33] <rwaldron> scottjehl yt?
[08:55:48] <scottjehl> hey Rick, what'sup?
[08:55:51] <rwaldron> hey dde
[08:55:53] <rwaldron> dude*
[08:55:53] <rwaldron> acl
[08:56:01] <rwaldron> wow
[08:56:11] <rwaldron> anyway... I was just looking at your pull request
[08:56:14] <scottjehl> thanks for those style fixups, btw
[08:56:24] <scottjehl> oh jq core?
[08:56:27] <scottjehl> nice
[08:56:28] <scottjehl> thanks
[08:56:29] <rwaldron> can you do me a favor and file a bugs.jquery.com ticket for that?
[08:56:33] <rwaldron> I will push it through ASAP
[08:56:47] <rwaldron> just a "book keeping" formality
[08:56:58] <scottjehl> sure. I managed to work around it in jQM, so it's not terribly urgent
[08:57:00] <rwaldron> just link to the jquery mobile issue
[08:57:05] <scottjehl> but yes
[08:57:09] <rwaldron> that's fine, we can get it fixed
[08:57:15] <rwaldron> rather, land your fix
[08:57:23] <rwaldron> i just want a core ticket for it
[08:57:35] <rwaldron> so we can add it to the 1.7 "stuff that got fixed"
[08:57:38] <scottjehl> k great. I wasn't sure if you'd prefer caching that body var like I did or just repeating it once on that line
[08:57:54] <scottjehl> overhead seemed sortof equal either way...
[08:58:24] <scottjehl> maybe a little better with the local var I thought
[08:58:32] <rwaldron> seems the approach is solid
[08:58:49] <scottjehl> cool
[08:59:19] <rwaldron> actually, can you just add an empty line?
[08:59:28] <rwaldron> here: https://github.com/scottjehl/jquery/blob/c8cc1b35e400ef125597dfa7d84ee63553f6501d/src/dimensions.js#L42-43
[08:59:49] <scottjehl> sure.
[08:59:53] <rwaldron> thanks dude
[09:00:07] <rwaldron> and I'll have timmy or dave land it
[09:00:32] <scottjehl> cool.
[09:00:36] <rwaldron> as soon as the tracker ticket is in :)
[09:00:38] <scottjehl> hey, _nickel
[09:00:59] <_nickel> scottjehl: heyo!
[09:01:09] <rwaldron> scottjehl as for the style stuff, my pleasure
[09:01:11] <_nickel> scottjehl: sorry again for vanishing mid sentence yesterday
[09:01:20] <rwaldron> i'm using that experience to "ramp up"
[09:01:22] <rwaldron> hahaha
[09:01:28] <scottjehl> rwaldron: sounds good. Any stylistic gripes on this jqm nokia fix btw?
[09:01:39] <rwaldron> hopefully I'll be able to help with _real_ issues in the near future
[09:01:42] <rwaldron> nope
[09:01:47] <rwaldron> good stuff from what i can tell
[09:01:59] <rwaldron> i didn't pull the branch locallly
[09:02:05] <scottjehl> ...the ajax opt-out I meant. Sorry
[09:02:08] <rwaldron> so as long as those are real tabs and not spaces
[09:02:09] <scottjehl> ok. cool
[09:02:23] <rwaldron> oh, ajax opt-out?
[09:02:27] <rwaldron> not sure what you mean...?
[09:02:42] <scottjehl> well, I think the style was okay actually. More just looking for reassurance that this is the best we can do. :/
[09:03:33] <rwaldron> sorry, i'm not sure what code you're referring to :\
[09:03:46] <scottjehl> change is mostly in support.js here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/symbian-support
[09:03:55] <_nickel> toddmparker: toddparker: got your email, I was having the same issue with chrome yesterday
[09:04:01] <scottjehl> sorry, it's what we were discussing before you joined in. my fault :)
[09:04:28] <scottjehl> first commit on that page describes the dire situation
[09:05:29] <rwaldron> scottjehl do you want line comments?
[09:05:44] <scottjehl> oh if you see anything, that'd be very helpful
[09:05:50] <rwaldron> cool
[09:05:59] <scottjehl> thanks!
[09:06:28] <rwaldron> scottjehl toddparker et al - i was also wondering if you guys had any plans to add code quality tools to your work flow, eg. JSHint?
[09:07:03] <scottjehl> _nickel may have insight on that
[09:07:12] <_nickel> rwaldron: :D
[09:07:15] <_nickel> rwaldron: already did
[09:07:19] <rwaldron> oh, nice
[09:07:25] <_nickel> no one is using them though :(
[09:07:31] <rwaldron> tsk tsk
[09:07:36] <rwaldron> is it one of the make targets?
[09:07:40] <_nickel> rwaldron: actually if you're interested I created a service for jshint so you don't have to install Node
[09:07:46] <_nickel> its a pre-commit hook
[09:08:20] <_nickel> the only change that needs to be made right now is to increase the timeout on the jshint service call since heroku takes a second to spin up dormant apps
[09:08:23] <rwaldron> scottjehl instead of line comments, i could jsut as easily do a sweep for you
[09:08:29] <rwaldron> would save you the time
[09:08:33] <rwaldron> and I dont mind
[09:08:51] <_nickel> rwaldron: https://github.com/johnbender/jshint-service
[09:09:01] <rwaldron> _nickel have you seen how we have the jshint stuff setup in jquery core?
[09:09:09] <_nickel> nope
[09:09:15] <rwaldron> it's super simple
[09:09:35] <rwaldron> but of course, require's node
[09:09:37] <_nickel> do you have to run Make?
[09:09:39] <_nickel> yah
[09:09:43] <_nickel> I don't want to install Node
[09:09:50] <rwaldron> though, comes with how-to-node on windows
[09:10:01] * _nickel grimaces
[09:10:09] <rwaldron> it's just an exe
[09:10:10] <scottjehl> rwaldron, well that'd be helpful! Is it only style changes?
[09:10:22] <rwaldron> scottjehl yeah
[09:10:24] <scottjehl> if so, I can land on master first
[09:10:28] <_nickel> rwaldron: https://github.com/johnbender/jshint-service/blob/master/pre-commit.sh
[09:10:31] <scottjehl> if pull is easier there
[09:10:32] <rwaldron> operators on RHS instead of LHS stuff
[09:10:50] <rwaldron> nothing dire
[09:10:55] <_nickel> you can just drop that into your .git/hooks/ as `pre-commit` and uncomment the line above jshint-uri and you're done
[09:11:14] <rwaldron> _nickel: interesting
[09:11:17] <rwaldron> i'll check that out
[09:11:25] <scottjehl> k going to merge over to master and push first, then. Very happy to take pull request after that!
[09:11:30] <rwaldron> ours is meant to be run with no network deps
[09:11:37] <rwaldron> scottjehl cool
[09:11:55] <_nickel> rwaldron: which is definitely a good idea
[09:12:10] <_nickel> rwaldron: I just preferred not installing node on my host machine
[09:12:23] <_nickel> although I could run it inside the vm I create for serving jqm
[09:12:24] <_nickel> hmm
[09:15:15] <toddparker> can everyone give /test/ a runthru in their devices to see if you spot any major snags that would hold up Beta 2?
[09:18:31] <_nickel> toddparker: what about that email?
[09:19:43] <scottjehl> k just pushed the symbian fixups
[09:20:45] <toddparker> woo hoo
[09:20:50] <toddparker> looks good on my testing
[09:23:45] <_nickel> toddparker: issue 2197?
[09:23:51] * gseguin is testing on 4th Gen and Android 2.3
[09:29:28] <gnarf> hey guys, whats the best way for me to debug an issue I'm seeing on my android device?
[09:29:46] <gnarf> is there like a droid browser emu that i can get from the android devkit or something?
[09:30:15] <gnarf> or any way I can use the "remote debugging port" feature ?
[09:31:45] <gseguin> gnarf: weinre or jsconsole.com
[09:36:17] <toddparker> _nickel - that is a bad one
[09:36:27] <toddparker> thought you had a fix?
[09:37:58] <_nickel> toddparker: nope, it appeared to be an issue with how chrome was dealing with the attribute removal
[09:38:08] <_nickel> scottjehl: ^
[09:38:27] <scottjehl> yep hey
[09:38:29] <_nickel> toddparker: it actually works fine if you click another button in the popup on chrome
[09:38:43] <_nickel> maybe that forces a reflow?
[09:38:57] <_nickel> I'm not even sure if I'm using that term correctly here tbh
[09:39:20] <_nickel> toddparker: I really should have tested on a couple of devices, sorry about that
[09:39:32] * _nickel can't remember if it was late in the day or not
[09:40:41] <_nickel> apparently its not working in safari either
[09:40:45] <_nickel> sounds like its webkit then
[09:40:52] <_nickel> although the email said it worked in chrome
[09:40:53] <_nickel> hmm
[09:41:14] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2198
[09:41:43] <_nickel> scottjehl: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.forms.select.js#L597
[09:41:45] <gseguin> yeah 2197 says: "android/iPhone"
[09:42:12] <_nickel> thats the line where you expect the top and left values applied in open() to be removed
[09:42:18] <_nickel> which, from dom inspection in my case they were
[09:42:42] <toddparker> hmmm
[09:43:10] <_nickel> yes I found it to be a tad odd
[09:43:17] <_nickel> but it works flawlessly in ff
[09:43:32] <gseguin> Did you guys see this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2173 ?
[09:43:46] <toddparker> it works in my chrome
[09:43:52] <toddparker> the x button, that is
[09:43:59] <scottjehl> hey handy bookmarklet:
[09:44:02] <scottjehl> javascript:location.href= "https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/" + prompt("enter issue number");
[09:44:09] <_nickel> toddparker: hmm what version
[09:44:14] <_nickel> scottjehl: nice
[09:44:25] <gseguin> thanks scottjehl
[09:44:30] <scottjehl> :)
[09:44:33] <toddparker> 13.0.blah
[09:44:40] <_nickel> yah mine's 12
[09:44:52] <_nickel> is there a place where we can check for known webkit bugs
[09:44:52] <_nickel> ?
[09:45:22] <scottjehl> http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/list
[09:45:23] <scottjehl> ?
[09:45:33] <_nickel> does that cover all webkit?
[09:45:54] <_nickel> since we're seeing the issues in mobile safari / android apparently
[09:46:42] <scottjehl> oh sorry thought it was chrome
[09:47:00] <toddparker> just so i'm testing the right thing - i open the dialog example and hit the "x" close button in the toolbar
[09:47:02] <toddparker> right?
[09:47:43] <scottjehl> https://bugs.webkit.org/ ?
[09:47:52] <scottjehl> wow... think we have a lot of bugs?
[09:48:05] <_nickel> hahah
[09:48:11] <_nickel> toddparker: thats correct
[09:48:27] <_nickel> it doesn't work for me in chromium 12.0.7
[09:48:44] <_nickel> err 12.0.742
[09:49:07] <toddparker> odd
[09:49:22] <_nickel> any luck on an iOS device?
[09:49:23] <toddparker> it's ok on iOS 5
[09:49:23] <toddparker> and Android 2.3
[09:49:29] <_nickel> hrm
[09:49:39] <_nickel> the other thing is
[09:49:39] <toddparker> my 2.2 is being odd
[09:49:49] <_nickel> it occasionally disappears after a random amount of time
[09:50:08] <gseguin> it's happening on my android 2.3
[09:50:40] <_nickel> anyone know a sure fire way to cause a reflow?
[09:50:48] <_nickel> I want to try that out to see if I get the desired result
[09:51:02] * _nickel is still not sure reflow is the proper term in this context
[09:53:28] <_nickel> toddparker: fixed
[09:53:44] <gseguin> _nickel: http://gent.ilcore.com/2011/03/how-not-to-trigger-layout-in-webkit.html
[09:53:58] <_nickel> gseguin: http://mir.aculo.us/2009/09/25/force-redraw-dom-technique-for-webkit-based-browsers/
[09:54:21] <gseguin> _nickel: thanks
[09:54:43] <_nickel> toddparker: scottjehl: self.listbox[0].style.webkitTransform = 'scale(1)';
[09:54:58] <_nickel> that forces the redraw, obviously that won't work everywhere lol
[09:55:33] <_nickel> but it appears to prove my hypothesis that its a rendering issue
[09:56:07] <_nickel> http://mir.aculo.us/2009/01/11/little-javascript-hints-episode-3-force-redraw/
[09:56:11] <_nickel> thats a more general solution
[10:00:05] <_nickel> alright
[10:00:19] <_nickel> self.listbox.attr("style", '-webkit-transform: scale(1);');
[10:00:23] <_nickel> that works
[10:00:42] <_nickel> and it won't break the universe me thinks
[10:00:47] <toddparker> the dialog close "X" link works for me on Android 2.1, 2.2., 2.3
[10:00:52] <toddparker> WebOS, BB6
[10:00:59] <toddparker> iOS 5
[10:01:01] <toddparker> Chrome
[10:01:05] <_nickel> toddparker: can you try it with the above?
[10:01:16] <toddparker> ?
[10:01:36] <_nickel> one sec I'll gist the change
[10:02:23] <toddparker> this? webkitTransform = 'scale(1)';
[10:02:49] <_nickel> toddparker: https://gist.github.com/9b2335494cddfd531110
[10:03:00] <_nickel> that forces the redraw
[10:03:07] <_nickel> which was the problem
[10:03:21] <toddparker> so you can reproduce?
[10:03:24] <_nickel> yes
[10:03:26] <toddparker> my issue is i can't
[10:03:28] <_nickel> chrome 12
[10:03:32] <_nickel> right
[10:03:38] <_nickel> I want to make sure it continues to work elsewhere :D
[10:04:07] <toddparker> gotcha
[10:04:10] <_nickel> then I can add a comment about all the issues and why its a problem and push the change
[10:04:20] <_nickel> I'll post to that other issue and see if he can test
[10:04:35] <toddparker> what's the easiest way for me to test this?
[10:04:46] <_nickel> hmm
[10:04:51] <scottjehl> _nickel - should we unset after jiggling the handle?
[10:05:02] <_nickel> scottjehl: good point let me try that
[10:06:14] <_nickel> scottjehl: ugh, if I change a remove attr it fails :(
[10:06:41] <_nickel> blarg
[10:06:47] <_nickel> its like it needs some time to feel good about it
[10:06:56] <toddparker> heh
[10:06:58] <toddparker> sketchy
[10:07:06] <toddparker> is this only on that build of chrome?
[10:07:24] <toddparker> or is an issue on an android or other webkit build?
[10:07:25] <_nickel> dunno
[10:07:35] <_nickel> gseguin: did you see the issue as well?
[10:07:40] <toddparker> chrome blows thru versions so fast, if this was a regression they fixed...
[10:07:40] * _nickel pages up
[10:07:42] <gseguin> yes
[10:07:47] <toddparker> where?
[10:07:53] <gseguin> on android 2.3.5
[10:08:04] <gseguin> using the jsfiddle that was provided
[10:08:33] <_nickel> and that won't get updated nearly as fast as desktop chrome :(
[10:09:00] <toddparker> odd. i see there's an update for me to 2.3.4 which i'm grabbing now
[10:09:04] <rwaldron> scottjehl, quick question about jquery.mobile.support.js
[10:09:06] <toddparker> 2.3.5 = DA FUTURE
[10:09:24] <gseguin> cyanogenmod 7
[10:09:32] <toddparker> i must be on 2.3.3 or something like that
[10:09:36] <toddparker> heh
[10:09:47] <toddparker> i have a stock nexus s
[10:10:50] <_nickel> gseguin == haxor
[10:11:02] <gseguin> I live dangerously, I know... :P
[10:11:04] <_nickel> I'm such a wus about using roms
[10:11:20] <_nickel> I think I'm a wus in general
[10:11:35] <gseguin> yeah well it was either that or I was stuck with 2.1
[10:11:36] <toddparker> dunno if that is an average android user or not :)
[10:11:38] <_nickel> I disagreed with @cowboy about just using location and not window.location without scoping
[10:11:41] <toddparker> prolly 1% are hacking away
[10:11:43] <_nickel> the other day
[10:11:48] <_nickel> I'm miss daisy
[10:11:59] <toddparker> 99% are moms who were sold it because it's "like and iphone"
[10:12:06] <_nickel> toddparker: we'll theres another post on the issue
[10:12:08] <toddparker> and will never run an update
[10:12:10] <rwaldron> toddparker is scottjehl around?
[10:12:21] <toddparker> he is, but may be heads down
[10:12:23] <_nickel> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2198
[10:12:32] <rwaldron> shot him with a rubberband
[10:12:35] <rwaldron> shoot*
[10:12:43] <scottjehl> hey
[10:12:46] <rwaldron> hahaha
[10:12:49] <rwaldron> nice shot toddparker
[10:12:50] <scottjehl> *ouch
[10:12:50] <toddparker> isn't that the same issue?
[10:12:52] * _nickel notes that this would be a good time for scottjehl to emote
[10:12:52] <rwaldron> ;)
[10:12:58] <_nickel> success!
[10:13:01] <rwaldron> scottjehl, just a quick q about: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.support.js#L111-113
[10:13:16] <_nickel> toddparker: 2194/2197/2198
[10:13:23] <rwaldron> i just want to make sure that the intention was to write, then over-write that rel attr
[10:13:38] <toddparker> so is this only the select dialog, not normal dialogs?
[10:13:53] <scottjehl> rwaldron: heh. crazy, huh?
[10:14:03] <gseguin> wait a minute now it's working on Android 2.3.5
[10:14:15] <toddparker> rwaldron - it's a *feature*
[10:14:16] <_nickel> toddparker: its the small multiple select
[10:14:17] <gseguin> when I point to the selects demo
[10:14:36] <scottjehl> the css wouldn't render anything added via JS unless it was loaded AFTER the JS
[10:14:42] <scottjehl> classes, etc, whatever
[10:14:59] <scottjehl> this toggling it on and off seems to tell it to smarten up
[10:15:10] <gseguin> brb
[10:15:18] <scottjehl> other ways that worked: reappending in place, or to head
[10:15:18] <scottjehl> etc
[10:15:22] <_nickel> toddparker: have you been testing the dialog multiple?
[10:15:26] <rwaldron> scottjehl ok, good to know
[10:15:40] <toddparker> _nickel - so this is only an issue with the multi-select custom menu?
[10:15:43] <rwaldron> either way, the each should be removable
[10:15:44] <scottjehl> rwaldron: these Symbians; they're not your average device
[10:16:00] <_nickel> toddparker: from my testing yes
[10:16:03] <rwaldron> 		$( "head link[rel=stylesheet]" ).attr("rel", "alternate stylesheet" ).attr( "rel", "stylesheet" )
[10:16:06] <rwaldron> does the same thing
[10:16:25] <scottjehl> oh good call! I'd had it using each when I was doing a replaceWith( $(this).clone() )
[10:16:36] <rwaldron> cool
[10:16:40] <scottjehl> forgot to take it out
[10:16:43] <rwaldron> good thing i asked!
[10:16:44] <scottjehl> great catch
[10:17:30] <scottjehl> also, that ua match makes me want to do angry things. Just sayin
[10:17:32] <toddparker> _nickel - if this only affects that one situation, it's not a blocker
[10:17:53] <_nickel> toddparker: hmm, alright
[10:17:59] <toddparker> is that the case?
[10:17:59] <_nickel> its a quick fix though
[10:18:13] <toddparker> does it affect dialogs in general?
[10:18:24] <toddparker> or even the long custom selects?
[10:18:37] <_nickel> nope
[10:18:40] <_nickel> the long ones work fine
[10:18:48] <_nickel> since they use a totally different mechanism
[10:18:53] <toddparker> so thi sis super edge-casey for me
[10:18:55] <_nickel> ie page dialogs
[10:19:07] <toddparker> i jsut need to wrap up beta 2 in the next 40 minutes if we're going today
[10:19:18] <_nickel> toddparker: I'm worried that its intermitent on a lot of browsers
[10:19:33] <toddparker> not saying we shouldn't fix
[10:20:01] <toddparker> but it's only if you're using a multi-select custom menu on chrome 12 where it's reproducable?
[10:20:30] <_nickel> toddparker: it sounded like gseguin was able to reproduce it evein if only every once in a while
[10:20:34] <_nickel> your call
[10:21:00] <rwaldron> scottjehl all set dude, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2199
[10:21:05] <_nickel> the fix seems small, though I don't really know the implications of setting the vender transform to scale(1)
[10:21:17] <toddparker> if you think this is a safe thing to land, let's go for it
[10:21:20] <scottjehl> Rick, you so stylish
[10:21:39] <scottjehl> :) thanks, man!
[10:21:45] <toddparker> the last thing i need help with is collapsible links seem to be broken
[10:21:48] <toddparker> that's a biggie
[10:21:54] <toddparker> on iOS anyway
[10:22:09] <toddparker> all those "in this section" links close, but don't navigate
[10:22:25] <rwaldron> scottjehl you're very welcome
[10:22:27] <scottjehl> I think our docs js just needs a change from vclick to click
[10:22:34] <scottjehl> for that issue
[10:22:49] <scottjehl> toddparker, let's test this here now
[10:22:56] <toddparker> k
[10:22:59] <toddparker> nevermind
[10:23:07] <_nickel> toddparker: are we out of firefighting mode with that bug?
[10:23:15] <_nickel> toddparker: I need to eat breakfast :(
[10:23:16] <toddparker> i think so
[10:23:18] <toddparker> heh
[10:23:18] <_nickel> cool
[10:23:23] <toddparker> at least it's not a blocker
[10:23:34] <toddparker> if that fix seems to work and isn't risky you can push it
[10:23:41] <toddparker> otheriwse, we can wait fo rb3
[10:23:42] <_nickel> i'm going to be setting up my new lappy today so I'll be on and off working on that and the refactor of select
[10:23:49] <toddparker> cool
[10:23:56] <toddparker> i'm waiting for my 11" air to arrive
[10:23:58] <_nickel> I honestly don't know what the broader implications are
[10:24:03] <_nickel> toddparker: oooh nice
[10:24:07] <_nickel> I got a new t420s
[10:24:13] * _nickel is happy
[10:24:28] <toddparker> enjoying windows 7?
[10:24:30] <toddparker> (kidding)
[10:24:38] <_nickel> toddparker: lol
[10:24:44] <toddparker> i know it's all modded out with some wacko kernel
[10:24:48] <_nickel> thats getting wiped today
[10:24:53] <toddparker> or whatever you people do
[10:24:58] <_nickel> "you people"
[10:25:01] <_nickel> THATS OUR WORD!
[10:25:05] <toddparker> heh
[10:25:18] <toddparker> you only feel good if your screen looks like the matrix
[10:25:23] <_nickel> lol
[10:25:30] <_nickel> my screen is gray and boring
[10:25:51] <toddparker> when i see a command line, i start crying and run home to mommy
[10:25:53] <_nickel> I was making fun of my friend last night for all the animations that Lion has for _everything_
[10:26:09] <_nickel> but I can appreciate the end user value
[10:26:10] <toddparker> i know
[10:26:18] <_nickel> spaces in particular
[10:26:19] <scottjehl> <-- loves 3 finger swipe between fullscreen lion apps
[10:26:25] <toddparker> ya
[10:26:38] <_nickel> if it makes you feel any better every app I run is full screen
[10:26:53] <_nickel> I use a tiling window manager
[10:26:54] * gseguin is catching up
[10:27:55] <toddparker> fancy
[10:33:15] <_nickel> scottjehl: do you have any thoughts on that attribute?
[10:33:42] <_nickel> scottjehl: that fixes the issue and forces the redraw but I don't know what implications it has otherwise
[10:34:38] <scottjehl> so you're setting and removing a styles?
[10:34:38] <_nickel> rwaldron: I'm going to push a quick change to the jshint service that moves the timeout to 3 seconds for the heroku hosted version
[10:34:43] <scottjehl> style*
[10:35:00] <_nickel> scottjehl: removing it immediately prevents the fixt from working
[10:35:05] <_nickel> we could setTimeout but I hate that
[10:35:27] <_nickel> tradeoff I guess
[10:35:29] <scottjehl> so this is only present in a back-version of Chrome?
[10:35:39] <scottjehl> mine is updated to 13 for instance
[10:35:45] <_nickel> mine's not
[10:35:51] <_nickel> and we saw it in versions of Android
[10:35:53] <scottjehl> seems like a browser bug they've worked around whenever you update
[10:35:54] <_nickel> if intermitently
[10:36:08] <scottjehl> oh. didn't see the android part
[10:36:09] <kinblas> _nickel: you don't want to have too many items with the transform on them
[10:36:09] <_nickel> *intermittently
[10:36:15] <kinblas> the browser caches bitmaps for those
[10:36:19] <scottjehl> that's my worry too
[10:36:26] <_nickel> and that is why I asked!
[10:36:29] <scottjehl> we get crashy with that
[10:36:42] <_nickel> is there anything else we can do to force a redraw?
[10:36:45] <toddparker> yeah, that technique is dangerous
[10:36:55] <_nickel> there's a more general solution linked to on that post
[10:36:59] <_nickel> I don't care what it is
[10:37:02] <_nickel> I just need a redraw
[10:37:59] <kinblas> so what's the issue here?
[10:38:10] <kinblas> you guys are just talking way tooo much for me to catch up
[10:38:14] <kinblas> :-)
[10:38:23] <kinblas> this channel is on fire!
[10:38:33] <scottjehl> _nickel - get scrollTop or something?
[10:38:53] * _nickel uses too many newlines
[10:39:05] <_nickel> scottjehl: let me try
[10:39:48] <kinblas> is the issue you are trying to solve about trying to get updated dimensions/location? Or is it trying to just force a redraw?
[10:40:19] <gnarf> anyone here ever tried dealing with caret positioning in inputs on mobile?
[10:40:54] <gnarf> I'm having an issue with http://view.jqueryui.com/mask/tests/visual/mask/mask.html on my android - the caret doesn't seem to be reading position correctly - http://jquery/jquery-ui/tests/unit/mask/mask.html unit tests seem to work....
[10:41:16] <_nickel> kinblas: the small multiple selects aren't closing when we .removeAttr
[10:41:29] <kinblas> _nickel: got sample?
[10:41:33] <_nickel> yes
[10:41:41] <_nickel> kinblas: https://gist.github.com/9b2335494cddfd531110
[10:42:15] <_nickel> kinblas: ui-selectmenu-hidden defined `top: 9999px: left: 9999px`
[10:42:37] <_nickel> kinblas: but the `style` attribute overrides that with the position we want it on the screen when open() is called
[10:43:03] <_nickel> so removing the `style` attribute should defer to the ui-selectmenu-hidden
[10:43:22] <_nickel> but it doesn't because chrome doesn't want to redraw
[10:43:27] <_nickel> rather chrome 12
[10:43:41] <kinblas> is this a problem in just one browser?
[10:44:02] <_nickel> kinblas: we have 3 logged isseus
[10:44:07] <_nickel> I can repro every time
[10:44:12] <_nickel> and gseguin got it on his devices
[10:44:43] <_nickel> the solution is to force a redraw
[10:44:47] <kinblas> _nickel: so to repro, I can just hit the test site and load the select page?
[10:44:51] <_nickel> just trying to figure out how without being lame
[10:45:00] <_nickel> kinblas: not unless you run one of the affected browsers
[10:45:08] <kinblas> I'm running Chrome 12
[10:45:10] <kinblas> on windows
[10:45:12] <_nickel> oooh
[10:45:12] <_nickel> try it
[10:45:19] <_nickel> be careful though
[10:45:23] <_nickel> it upgrades in the background!
[10:45:31] * _nickel thinks chrome is sneaky
[10:45:54] <kinblas> so click on a "custom" seletc
[10:45:58] <kinblas> like the 7 day one?
[10:46:11] <_nickel> yah
[10:46:13] <_nickel> small
[10:46:14] <_nickel> custom
[10:46:16] <_nickel> multiple select
[10:46:20] <_nickel> down at the botto
[10:46:51] <kinblas> so the issue is the X doesn't work?
[10:47:34] <_nickel> yassir
[10:47:48] <kinblas> so riddle me this
[10:47:53] <_nickel> lol
[10:47:54] <kinblas> why does single select work
[10:47:57] <kinblas> ??
[10:48:37] <kinblas> that is, what is different between the way we close that dialog in the single select case
[10:48:42] <kinblas> versus the multi select case
[10:49:16] <_nickel> not sure
[10:49:18] <_nickel> not sure at all
[10:49:24] <kinblas> I would start there
[10:49:43] <_nickel> kinblas: I would imagine its the composition of the listbox elements
[10:49:54] <_nickel> it might be preventing the redraw for some reason
[10:51:39] <_nickel> interestingly it works in beta 1 too
[10:51:43] <_nickel> time for a bisect
[10:52:57] <toddparker> yeah, seems odd it only affects this situation
[10:53:30] <toddparker> so has anyone seen other issues that would be a blocker for this going out today?
[10:53:49] <gseguin> none here
[10:54:56] <scottjehl> we'll see how many Nokias that fix will reach after pushing b2 I guess
[10:55:26] <scottjehl> I'd imagine there are some obscure UAs that may not match, but we got the ones we have here at least
[10:55:57] <toddparker> sool. just wanted to make sure you all did some driving around on test
[10:57:29] <scottjehl> things are testing well for me, functionally
[10:57:40] <gseguin> same here
[10:58:30] <_nickel> well I've identified the commit thats causing the issue but the lord only knows why https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/ada46734ecd45bb9f964e925ed228fb5f1607376
[10:59:10] <_nickel> scottjehl: ah!
[10:59:51] <_nickel> it no longer does the append to
[10:59:59] <_nickel> at least I think thats the issue
[11:03:45] <scottjehl> hmm. it should still append
[11:04:40] <kinblas> _nickel: gseguin pointed out https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2173 earlier
[11:04:42] <kinblas> it fixes the problem
[11:05:03] <_nickel> ...
[11:05:11] <gseguin> by doing the appendTo
[11:05:12] <_nickel> scottjehl: ^
[11:05:16] <_nickel> ugh
[11:05:24] <_nickel> someone click the merge button and we'll move on with life
[11:05:35] <_nickel> gseguin: sorry I wasn't paying attention
[11:05:40] <_nickel> there were many conversations happening
[11:05:42] <scottjehl> hmm. okay. Just wanted to make sure we didn't back out that other change, as it fixed 2 much bigger bugs
[11:05:51] <scottjehl> sorry for the regression, guys
[11:06:23] <kinblas> _nickel: perhaps you can do the mergin honors?
[11:06:24] <kinblas> :-)
[11:06:31] <_nickel> scottjehl: oh no don't want to back out the commit
[11:06:38] <_nickel> kinblas: lol
[11:06:43] <_nickel> shameful button clicks
[11:06:43] <gseguin> but it does the appendTo in a different function though
[11:07:14] <_nickel> gseguin: only when its bound to pagehide
[11:08:11] <_nickel> gseguin: if we're talking about the same thing
[11:08:33] <gseguin> I'm talking about the pull request 2173
[11:08:59] <_nickel> gseguin: https://github.com/SamuelKC/jquery-mobile/commit/f097630a71aaf318ef9c38e51bb745008f79cf7c
[11:09:09] <_nickel> thats the right spot
[11:09:11] <_nickel> same place I have it
[11:09:19] <gseguin> yeah
[11:09:23] <_nickel> verbatim change I made locally to solve the problem
[11:10:15] <_nickel> we actually have to do this append for all the menus because its the only way we get an accurate outerHeight() value when deciding if it should be a dialog or a small custom select
[11:10:17] <gseguin> I can't reproduce the issue anymore
[11:10:41] <_nickel> point being that we should be doing that regardless
[11:10:59] <_nickel> or at least thats how it seems to me
[11:12:22] <scottjehl> let's just be sure it doesn't affect the other custom menu situations, ya?
[11:13:39] <_nickel> yassir
[11:13:45] <_nickel> I'll do some testing
[11:16:10] <_nickel> scottjehl: I tested on master
[11:16:34] <_nickel> scottjehl: I'm going to run the test suite on my new branch since I've added some in there
[11:18:17] <_nickel> scottjehl: that is decoupled-select
[11:18:21] <_nickel> they all passed
[11:19:05] <gseguin> toddmparker: did you see this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2201
[11:21:20] <gseguin> toddparker:  ^^^
[11:21:38] <_nickel> todd is an extremely connected guy :D
[11:22:13] <gseguin> yeah I  don't know which todd to talk to :)
[11:26:40] <_nickel> gseguin: rwaldron asked if we were using jshint
[11:26:54] <_nickel> I pointed him at the service
[11:27:11] <_nickel> though I don't know if anyone but me is using it as a pre-commit hook
[11:27:37] <gseguin> I'm not, because I forgot
[11:27:42] <gseguin> to set up the hook
[11:27:48] <gseguin> but I'll set it up
[11:27:55] <_nickel> cool
[11:28:35] <gseguin> on the test machine, we could have a qunit page for jshint for our CI
[11:30:39] <gseguin> _nickel: what do you think?
[11:30:57] <_nickel> gseguin: this is a really good idea
[11:31:03] <gseguin> are we ready to break the build on lints?
[11:31:59] <gseguin> we just need to align the rules of the precommit hook with the jshint.html one
[11:32:22] <_nickel> that was going to be my next question
[11:32:32] <_nickel> can we "warn"
[11:32:43] <_nickel> at this point there are _SO_ many lint issues
[11:32:51] <_nickel> we would have to do a sweep to clean them up first
[11:33:46] <_nickel> I would love that though
[11:34:03] <_nickel> once I finish this select refactor I'm going to clean up those files for the default settings
[11:34:15] <gseguin> I guess you can warn at pre-commit for a finer set of lints but break the build for unacceptable lints (like trailing commas)
[11:36:50] <_nickel> gseguin: thats nice thinking
[11:36:58] <_nickel> globals etc
[11:47:07] <toddparker> great you fixed that issue
[11:48:04] <gseguin> toddparker: ?
[11:48:37] <_nickel> alright time to get the new lenovo set up
[11:49:11] <toddparker> didn't you pull in that select fix you dug up
[11:50:20] <gseguin> I did not, _nickel earned the right of clicking the button since he spent time investigating
[11:50:39] <_nickel> lol
[11:50:50] <_nickel> I'll go push the button
[11:51:29] <gseguin> :)
[11:51:31] <toddparker> k
[11:51:38] <toddparker> gonna say, it looks open
[11:53:37] <_nickel> toddparker: gseguin: the monkey has pushed the button
[11:53:55] <gseguin> yay!
[11:53:56] <_nickel> also commented and closed the other two issues
[11:54:07] <toddparker> good monkey
[11:54:25] <toddparker> guess we should review those pulls
[11:54:38] <toddparker> bender - would you mind giving those a look when you get a chance?
[11:54:45] <toddparker> you are the pull master
[12:07:54] <_nickel> lol
[12:08:09] * _nickel is "Teh Pull Masterz"
[12:08:25] <_nickel> toddmparker: which pull requests are those?
[12:08:41] <_nickel> gseguin: do you know which he is referring to?
[12:09:17] <todd_> jus tin general
[12:09:33] <todd_> 22 right now
[12:09:34] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pulls
[12:09:40] <_nickel> ahh
[12:09:53] <_nickel> should I prioritize that over the select refactor?
[12:09:59] <_nickel> todd_: ^
[12:12:21] <todd_> no, but you're good at keeping on top of these
[12:12:33] <todd_> so just wanted that back on your radar
[12:14:00] <_nickel> todd_: cool
[12:14:08] <_nickel> todd_: also, flattery will get you everywhere lol
[12:14:34] * _nickel suffers from vanity
[12:19:11] <todd_> you're so handsome!
[12:19:15] <todd_> and smart too.
[12:19:27] <todd_> are those new shoes. Like 'em
[12:19:34] <todd_> etc.
[12:24:25] <_nickel> lol
[12:24:31] <_nickel> working on responding to the issues now
[12:24:41] <_nickel> I'll just get the ball rolling
[12:29:26] <_nickel> gseguin: todd_: anyone know who did the weather experiment?
[12:31:09] <todd_> scottjehl did
[12:31:12] <todd_> but it's way old
[12:31:19] <todd_> we can close that
[12:31:22] <todd_> me thinks
[12:31:29] <todd_> it's not linked to anywhere in the docs
[12:31:36] <todd_> but it's still in experiments
[12:32:35] <_nickel> can I remove it from the experiments then?
[12:32:43] <_nickel> todd_: ^
[12:33:44] <scottjehl> can we remove /experiments?
[12:33:47] <scottjehl> :)
[12:34:04] * _nickel agrees with scottjehl 
[12:34:11] <scottjehl> imo scrollview should be in a branch. Other than that, I think the experiments dir can go
[12:34:21] <_nickel> kinblas: any opinions?
[12:34:26] <_nickel> gseguin: ^
[12:35:21] <scottjehl> also, few branches to delete still. fastclick-fixes, navigation, pathfixes
[12:35:33] <scottjehl> per Kin's permission
[12:36:05] <_nickel> man I need to get started on my install
[12:36:35] <_nickel> the very idea of leaving a brand new laptop wrapped up
[12:36:38] <_nickel> its jus silly
[12:36:43] <_nickel> *just
[12:36:58] <scottjehl> oh, re: experiments. The themeswitcher should move to docs/assets
[12:37:50] <_nickel> taking notes now
[12:38:00] <scottjehl> :)
[12:38:51] <_nickel> the first time I've used my optical drive
[12:39:38] <_nickel> right now to burn ubuntu
[12:46:34] <kinblas> so if experimental stuff is on a branch
[12:46:41] <kinblas> how do folks in the forums get to them easily?
[12:46:58] <kinblas> scrollview is probably one of the more popular experiments now that datepicker is gone
[12:47:10] <kinblas> I see posts regarding scrollview pretty regularly on the forums
[13:08:50] * gseguin was out for lunch, catching up
[13:09:48] <_nickel> does anyone mind that I request testing from pull request submitters ?
[13:13:09] <gseguin> _nickel: I think it's fair
[13:13:43] <_nickel> actually in the case that prompted me to ask I probably need to do it myself since its a new /test/unit subfolder
[13:14:05] <gseguin> re: experiments, I agree with Kin, how do people access scrollview if we put it in a branch?
[13:14:56] <gseguin> _nickel: that doesn't prevent them to write the test case and put it in a gist
[13:15:32] <_nickel> gseguin: kinblas: we could make he branches available at subdirectories on the site
[13:15:58] * gseguin likes the idea
[13:16:15] <kinblas> _nickel: yeah but that's not really discoverable
[13:16:24] <kinblas> unless we have an experiments page
[13:16:34] <_nickel> hmm
[13:16:46] <kinblas> jquerymobile.com/experiments
[13:16:52] <kinblas> and link to it from the main page or something
[13:16:59] <_nickel> I think thats a good idea
[13:17:12] <_nickel> we can also provide information about how we won't support these _at all_
[13:17:12] <gseguin> kinblas: how is it discoverable today?
[13:17:24] <kinblas> gseguin: good question
[13:17:32] <kinblas> I think what's happened so far
[13:17:40] <kinblas> is that folks notice the experiments dir
[13:17:46] <kinblas> in the zip
[13:18:28] <kinblas> I'm not sure if we zip the whole developer source anymore or not
[13:18:55] <kinblas> I suppose in the mean time what we could do
[13:19:04] <kinblas> is just put up an Experiments WIKI page
[13:19:15] <kinblas> and point to stuff from there
[13:19:53] <scottjehl> I like that
[13:21:30] <kinblas> scottjehl: I guess the problem after that is where to hold experiment samples
[13:24:16] <todd_> are branches too techie?
[13:24:19] <scottjehl> dunno. I think branches work well
[13:24:42] <todd_> seems to me that someone shouldn't be using an experimental plugin if they are a n00b
[13:25:01] <scottjehl> a lot of this stuff is not really recommended for use yet anyway - it's not like we need to sell people on downloading them, right?
[13:25:08] <todd_> for example, we know that the scrollview code hasn't been touched in months and wasn't really finished
[13:25:44] <todd_> if people are just chucking this in and don't understand where this could break, it sort of undermines the stated support of the library
[13:26:04] <todd_> that's why making these a bit harder to get to mightbe ok
[13:26:17] <todd_> we could post a demo page somewhere
[13:26:29] <todd_> but to get the code, you might need to dig a bit?
[13:26:31] <gseguin> John R. used it in his Khan iPad app, so I guess it's not that unready
[13:26:40] <kinblas> lol
[13:26:42] <todd_> his is an *app*
[13:26:48] <scottjehl> native
[13:26:49] <todd_> works great on ipad
[13:27:10] <todd_> just saying that if people use this on a web site/app. there are potential issues
[13:27:17] <todd_> sorry kin, not picking on scrollview
[13:27:21] <kinblas> lol
[13:27:23] <kinblas> I know
[13:27:26] <todd_> just making a point
[13:27:32] * kinblas packs his scrollview up and leaves
[13:27:38] <kinblas> heh
[13:27:38] <todd_> COME BACK!
[13:27:50] <kinblas> ok so I can pull the current master
[13:27:56] <kinblas> into a scrollview branch for now
[13:28:01] <todd_> the issue so far is that if it's int he repo, people assume it's supported and ready
[13:28:02] <kinblas> then just delete the directory?
[13:28:11] <todd_> sure
[13:28:27] <todd_> in ui, we had a lab folder like this that was a mess
[13:28:37] <kinblas> the cool thing is now that we have the decoupled widgets
[13:28:56] <kinblas> we don't need the pagecreate listener code to use the scrollview
[13:29:01] <kinblas> that can be baked into scrollview
[13:29:01] <todd_> i'd rather release a plugin as a personal thing and when it gets solid/popular and we include it and add support
[13:29:07] <todd_> exactly
[13:29:21] <scottjehl> before deleting, we want the themeswitcher moved to docs/assets too
[13:29:29] <kinblas> I'm just sad to lose the online access to the samples that's all
[13:30:10] <kinblas> but I can host that myself on my personal site
[13:30:47] <kinblas> scottjehl: I was only talking about deleting scrollview
[13:30:54] <kinblas> not the experiments directory as a whole
[13:30:57] <kinblas> :-)
[13:31:19] <scottjehl> oh, well I was
[13:31:21] <scottjehl> :)
[13:31:32] * kinblas looks what's in the experiments dir
[13:31:50] <kinblas> what about all that other stuff?
[13:31:55] <kinblas> weather branch?
[13:32:00] <kinblas> converter branch?
[13:32:16] <kinblas> google-maps branch?
[13:32:20] <scottjehl> weather was mine, we can delete it
[13:32:32] <kinblas> or move it to the fg site?
[13:32:49] <scottjehl> converter was Joern's - maybe he'd want to post it to his repo or something, but it hasn't been touched in months
[13:32:51] <kinblas> those are still nice examples?
[13:33:00] <kinblas> what does converter do?
[13:33:22] <scottjehl> also, it was js-dependent.Cool demo, but I'm not sure it'd be a workflow we'd recommend for simple sites/apps
[13:33:43] <scottjehl> currency converter. I think it's non functional now
[13:34:43] <scottjehl> deleting doesn't have to mean erasing from the web. I think some of these can move elsewhere, but having them in master is weird
[13:36:24] <kinblas> scottjehl: can we delete after we tag beta2?
[13:36:46] * kinblas likes branching at a known state
[13:38:53] <todd_> sure
[13:39:03] <todd_> just waiting for john r to get in and do that
[13:39:07] <todd_> any minute now hopefully
[13:40:14] <scottjehl> oh totally. this is not urgent :)
[13:41:35] <_nickel> todd_: so I can close the experiments pull request and let the guy know we're probably going to remove it?
[13:41:43] <todd_> yeah
[13:41:48] <_nickel> honestly
[13:41:53] <_nickel> can we move the experiments to another repo
[13:41:59] <_nickel> or something similar
[13:42:02] <todd_> that
[13:42:05] <todd_> is fine too
[13:42:09] <_nickel> I'm fine with displaying them
[13:42:21] <todd_> i just don't like the fuzziness of having them in the main repo
[13:42:25] <_nickel> but dealing with support/pull requests for unsupported stuff
[13:42:26] <todd_> too many bug reports
[13:42:32] <_nickel> exactly
[13:42:41] <_nickel> we should commit stuff we don't want to support
[13:42:44] <_nickel> *shouldn't
[13:43:10] <todd_> yup
[13:44:15] <todd_> kin - the scrollview should probably be re-thought of as a polyfill for browsers that don't support overflow:
[13:44:24] <todd_> since ios 5 will support this very soon
[13:44:30] <gseguin> hey _nickel, if you have time today, can you comment on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2006
[13:44:32] <todd_> and BB6 may already
[13:44:54] <_nickel> gseguin: yah thanks for the reminder
[13:44:59] <_nickel> that one is stagnating
[13:45:00] <_nickel> lol
[13:45:12] <kinblas_> sorry got disconnected
[13:45:15] <todd_> that way, you can have an overflow region/panel and only get all that JS if you need it
[13:45:15] <kinblas_> what's stagnating?
[13:45:21] <todd_> (and don't choke on it)
[13:45:38] <todd_> that pull ^^
[13:46:24] <gseguin> I can work with you on the scrollview thing Kin if you need help
[13:47:57] <kinblas> gseguin: ok, but I wasn't planning on doing anything till post 1.0
[13:48:05] <kinblas> we have to ship this thing :-)
[13:48:24] <gseguin> ok
[13:48:42] * _nickel agrees with Kin
[13:48:51] <todd_> yeah, i think we should wait til post-1.0
[13:50:02] <_nickel> less feature more creature
[13:50:35] <_nickel> where creature = beer/liquor
[13:51:02] <_nickel> gseguin: I'll look at that pull next
[13:51:26] <gseguin> _nickel: thanks
[14:19:45] <nicovalencia> Hey guys, is there still no way to bind to slider/range change events?
[14:20:39] <nicovalencia> It seems like it would be easy to just trigger an input change event when the slider widget updates so we could bind to that... is that feature already queued up? ( I hate patching stuff in the source ).
[14:21:06] <todd_> this is an issue assigned to gseguin so it's on deck
[14:21:08] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1589
[14:21:46] <todd_> there was a pull for it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2099
[14:21:56] <nicovalencia> Killer, I'll patch it for now, just wanted to check in and see if it was lined up for core soon.
[14:22:01] <nicovalencia> Even better ^. Thanks todd!
[14:22:08] <todd_> it is.
[14:22:20] <todd_> we've just been working on bigger ticket items
[14:22:34] <todd_> these smaller things are queued up for post beta 2
[14:23:47] <nicovalencia> Awesome, much appreciated. Nice work guys. So far, our app is going pretty smooth, b1 helped a bunch. It's getting bigger *muahaha*
[15:32:55] <toddparker> jQuery Mobile Beta 2 Released! Symbian^3 support, easily enhance injected markup, new cache mgmt & page pre-fetch, http://t.co/bgjJOgc
[15:32:59] <toddparker> woo hoo
[15:33:11] <toddparker> thanks everyone
[15:33:14] <toddparker> awesome work
[15:33:24] <toddparker> epic blog post, per usual
[15:33:36] <gseguin> w00t!
[15:34:48] <toddparker> tweet away
[15:41:16] <_nickel> shweet
[15:49:05] <_nickel> gseguin: examining the pull
[15:49:21] <gseguin> the code is not in yet
[15:49:35] <_nickel> gseguin: sorry, the pull request
[15:49:52] <_nickel> I need to feed my daughter quickly
[15:49:53] <gseguin> _nickel: he wants us to agree on the logic before he iterates again
[15:50:04] <_nickel> ah
[15:50:09] <_nickel> thats right
[15:50:34] <gseguin> _nickel: go feed your daughter, hungry baby == crying baby
[15:50:42] <_nickel> gseguin: she's not there yet
[15:50:47] <gseguin> crying baby == unhappy daddy
[15:51:01] <_nickel> the regest attribute seems to hamstring this whole thing
[15:51:06] <_nickel> it should really be a callback
[15:51:14] <_nickel> so people can do arbitrary things while searching
[15:51:22] <_nickel> mind you I'm still reading through the posts
[15:52:22] <_nickel> gseguin: especially because this whole discussion revolves around searching thru strings
[15:52:25] <_nickel> which is a sticky topic
[15:52:29] <_nickel> and really not the point of jqm
[15:52:35] <_nickel> if you want to do something interesting
[15:52:37] <_nickel> here's the calback
[15:52:42] <_nickel> *callback
[15:52:43] <_nickel> have at it
[15:53:11] <_nickel> we need to start delegating some of this stuff, its a lot of additional complexity
[15:53:35] <gseguin> true, I wasn't seeing it in that angle
[15:54:19] <_nickel> so you could define the searchCallback as a function that gets the string and returns a bool
[15:54:26] <_nickel> searchFilterCallback
[15:54:48] <_nickel> and if its defined thats will determine whether something is kept or tossed
[15:55:41] <gseguin> and we provide the default one
[15:55:45] <_nickel> yessir
[15:55:50] <_nickel> dogfooding and all hat
[15:55:52] <_nickel> *that
[15:55:59] <gseguin> works for me
[15:56:20] <_nickel> gseguin: it would be good to post the alternate solution there and let them see what we want to do I think
[15:56:40] <_nickel> also my thoughts on this are mostly based on the fact that we aren't a search library so it would be good to discuss this tomorrow morning
[15:57:12] <gseguin> there?
[15:57:37] <gseguin> _nickel: as a comment to the pull request you mean?
[15:57:46] <_nickel> gseguin: yah
[15:57:56] <_nickel> I figure thats only fair since they've put in so much time
[15:58:55] <gseguin> agreed
[16:19:08] <kinblas> gseguin: FYI, I have some fixes for the transitions branch that fix the slide transition
[16:19:20] <gseguin> oh
[16:19:27] <gseguin> great!
[16:19:37] <gseguin> push it I wanna see!
[16:19:47] <gseguin> it's driving me nuts
[16:20:05] <kinblas> I'll push in a couple of minutes
[16:20:53] <kinblas> gseguin: so one question I had was what isTwoMovingParts is about?
[16:21:10] <kinblas> why wouldn't we want to always execute the done callback for the "from" element?
[16:21:11] <gseguin> maybe not the best name
[16:21:22] <gseguin> but that's all that inspired me
[16:21:34] <gseguin> there are 2 kinds of transitions
[16:21:47] <gseguin> one where the in comes and overlaps out
[16:21:55] <gseguin> so out doesn't move
[16:22:10] <gseguin> and the other one is  when in and out are moving
[16:22:17] <gseguin> for flip for instance
[16:22:30] <kinblas> right but for the overlap case
[16:22:48] <kinblas> all folks really have to do is not define a transition for the out case
[16:22:49] <gseguin> I was wondering about executing doneFunc everytime
[16:22:52] <kinblas> in CSS
[16:23:19] <kinblas> the only way for us to support both cases reliably
[16:23:33] <kinblas> ... not knowing ahead of time the kooky transitions folks will come up with themselves
[16:23:42] <gseguin> yeah but it triggers an animation (that does nothing) and we act only when animationEnd is triggered
[16:23:53] <gseguin> which happens 325ms after that
[16:24:03] <gseguin> and 325ms of nothing is quite long
[16:24:04] <kinblas> ah I see what you're getting at
[16:25:20] <kinblas> I think the assumption before was that we always assumed that when the "in" transition was done, that the entire transition was done.
[16:25:38] <gseguin> yep
[16:26:02] <kinblas> so why can't we do the same in this case?
[16:26:15] <kinblas> if a transition to the new page is done ... shouldn't it be showing already?
[16:26:40] <gseguin> not sure I'm following you anymore
[16:26:56] <kinblas> so in the keyframe animation implementation
[16:27:04] <kinblas> (the original jqtouch CSS)
[16:27:09] <gseguin> yeah
[16:27:15] <kinblas> we would just listen for the end of the "in" transition
[16:27:22] <gseguin> the current one on master
[16:27:24] <kinblas> yeah
[16:28:25] <gseguin> hmm I missed that part: $to.animationComplete( doneFunc );
[16:29:09] <kinblas> another thing I noticed
[16:29:14] <gseguin> let try that out
[16:29:15] <kinblas> it there are 2 moving parts
[16:29:23] <kinblas> the deferred object will get resolved twice
[16:29:33] <kinblas> once for the from and another for the to
[16:29:41] <gseguin> yeah when doing a non reverse
[16:29:52] <kinblas> I think we should just resolve on the to/in case
[16:29:58] <gseguin> I noticed that, was working on figuring where I got things wrong
[16:31:19] <gseguin> so I'm adding $.fn.transitionComplete
[16:37:07] <gseguin> kinblas: still having problems with the slide translation
[16:37:27] <kinblas> yeah I can check in the missing targets
[16:37:28] <kinblas> for that
[16:37:36] <gseguin> http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/docs/index.html
[16:37:48] <kinblas> there was a missing rule
[16:37:51] <kinblas> and some missing targets
[16:37:57] <gseguin> oh wait did you push?
[16:38:15] <kinblas> gseguin: The requested URL /jqm/wip/docs/index.html was not found on this server.
[16:38:34] <kinblas> gseguin: I havent pushed anything yet :-)
[16:38:49] <gseguin> hold on
[16:39:41] <gseguin> http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/index.html
[16:40:29] <gseguin> so it works great on Safari desktop
[16:40:37] <gseguin> but try it on you ipad
[16:43:41] <kinblas> gseguin: I just pushed the CSS changes https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commits/transitions
[16:43:56] <gseguin> alright let me update
[16:43:58] <kinblas> the actual changes are here:
[16:43:59] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/62eadc9c1e04810cb4b492f9c2bb349539f1d05b
[16:44:10] <kinblas> now keep in mind, they don't work correctly
[16:44:25] <kinblas> unless
[16:44:50] <kinblas> you pass true here:
[16:44:52] <kinblas> $.mobile.css3TransitionHandler = makeCss3TransitionHandler(true);
[16:52:37] <gseguin> kinblas: but that creates a push transition
[16:52:46] <gseguin> rather than an overlap
[16:53:12] <kinblas> gseguin: that's what the original slide transition did
[16:53:18] <gseguin> nope
[16:53:23] <gseguin> I thought so too
[16:53:45] <gseguin> but scottjehl & toddmparker told me that it was overlap
[16:54:08] <kinblas> uh
[16:54:09] <kinblas> it's a push
[16:54:11] <kinblas> http://jquerymobile.com/test/#/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[16:54:16] <kinblas> it's always been that way
[16:54:28] <gseguin> hmm
[16:54:35] <kinblas> :-)
[16:54:38] <gseguin> alright so that true for slide
[16:54:46] <gseguin> but not slide up
[16:54:46] <kinblas> I believe the up/down stuff
[16:54:49] <kinblas> was overlay
[16:54:50] <kinblas> yeah
[16:55:33] <kinblas> gseguin: whew you had me thinking I was on drugs for a sec :-) Still suffering from jet-lag
[16:55:35] <kinblas> :-)
[16:55:44] <gseguin> :)
[16:55:45] <gseguin> http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/wip/index.html#/jqm/wip/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[16:57:13] <gseguin> still not working on ipad though :(
[17:02:59] <kinblas> gseguin: did you set that function call to true?
[17:03:17] <gseguin> yep
[17:03:36] <gseguin> I handle it the same way I handle flip
[17:03:57] <gseguin> do you have time tomorrow?
[17:04:06] <kinblas> does it work here:
[17:04:06] <kinblas> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[17:04:31] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah I'll have time tomorrow
[17:04:37] <kinblas> doh wrong url
[17:04:40] <kinblas> hang on a sec
[17:05:03] <kinblas> sorry for this long URL
[17:05:04] <kinblas> http://webpro.host.adobe.com/people/jblas/jqm3/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[17:05:43] <gseguin> loading
[17:06:07] <gseguin> nope same problem
[17:06:33] <kinblas> hmmm works for me
[17:06:36] <kinblas> what are you seeing?
[17:06:49] <kinblas> when I press slide
[17:06:51] <gseguin> hmm let me make a video
[17:07:39] <kinblas> hmmm interesting ... it sometimes doesn't slide in
[17:07:45] <kinblas> when going backwards
[17:08:10] <gseguin> yup
[17:08:57] <kinblas> I think I know what that flashing is about too
[17:09:06] <kinblas> I have a theory anyways
[17:09:11] <kinblas> we can talk more tomorrow
[17:09:32] <gseguin> yep
[17:12:49] <gseguin> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGzSDeqCpm4
[17:13:03] <gseguin> sorry for the orientation
[17:15:40] <_nickel> gseguin: I've commented with a simple suggested implementation
[17:16:15] <_nickel> on that pull request
[17:19:58] <rwaldron> gseguin _nickel i have a Q if you have a moment
[17:20:25] <rwaldron> is there anything that i should know, specifically about mobile safari making CORS "POST" requests?
[17:20:33] <rwaldron> that you've come across in your tavels?
[17:20:36] <rwaldron> travels*
[17:21:24] <gseguin> thanks _nickel
[17:22:10] <_nickel> rwaldron: we had a xss issue earlier because of the core default of permitting those requests but I don't know if it affected POST requests specifically
[17:22:20] <_nickel> I think we ended up disabling it by default
[17:22:21] <_nickel> gseguin: ?
[17:22:59] <gseguin> that's all I know abouty CORS
[17:23:07] <gseguin> I think kinblas knows more
[17:23:27] <rwaldron> ohhhh
[17:23:36] <kinblas> rwaldron: I don't think there are any differences between GET/POST
[17:23:41] <rwaldron> there are
[17:23:53] <kinblas> we just disallow cross-domain ajax requests unless a special flag is set to true
[17:23:58] <rwaldron> older mobile safari would truncate that content-legth to zero
[17:24:03] <rwaldron> shit
[17:24:04] <rwaldron> really?
[17:24:06] <kinblas> apparently jquery core always allows it if it is available
[17:24:11] <rwaldron> yeah
[17:24:14] <rwaldron> what's the flag?
[17:24:18] <rwaldron> i need to take that back
[17:24:25] <kinblas> allowCrossDomainPages
[17:24:35] <kinblas> $.mobile.allowCrossDomainPages
[17:24:40] <_nickel> which is a security vuln on ajax pages loads because of the way we manipulate content
[17:25:04] <kinblas> I think the concern for us is that if someone can execute code to manipulate the location.hash
[17:25:08] <_nickel> I still need to go read that email string again, I don't feel that confident in what I'm saying
[17:25:10] <kinblas> we'll wake up and load it
