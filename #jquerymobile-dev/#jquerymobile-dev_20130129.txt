[05:18:46] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:28:06] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: thanks for adding those icon demos
[05:28:06] <bot-t> (57 hours 9 mins ago) <arschmitz> tell toddmparker_: its caused by a panel on the same page as slider and there must be a data-role=content with the slider in front of it 
[05:28:06] <bot-t> (57 hours 9 mins ago) <arschmitz> tell toddmparker_: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/666/edit
[05:28:06] <bot-t> (57 hours 7 mins ago) <arschmitz> tell toddmparker_: border-width is related for sure as you noticed also
[05:28:06] <bot-t> (57 hours 2 mins ago) <arschmitz> tell toddmparker_: looks like this is due to a css rule that fixes an ie7 issue with rangeslider. it normally does not apply at all on anything else it should not be possible for it to but somehow when there is a panel it does?? going to need to find another solution

[05:28:10] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14b008515 15toddparker: Demos: Tweaked content for the icon disc and set demos
[05:28:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker_ you can ignore all that its old and wrong!
[05:29:04] <toddmparker_> Can we make this easier for folks? I see we need a script now, but it would be nice to have classes for the disc and icon set that just work via class in the button structure...
[05:29:10] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: consider it ignored
[05:30:36] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: also, I want to add an example of how to do this kinda thing for a listview. I'd want to show a c theme with the black icon, no disc or shadow. Be cool if you could add these classes to the UL and have it just work. I might take it further and show how to use css to make the black icon a % opacity so it's no so dark.
[05:31:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: something is broken now http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/icons/
[05:32:27] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: no it's not possible without adding a class or we would have to make changes to buttonMarkup
[05:32:46] <uGoMobi> something to look at for 1.4
[05:33:40] <toddmparker_> for sure
[05:34:05] <toddmparker_> that script in the head means we need to link via no ajax, right
[05:34:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes
[05:34:41] <toddmparker_> there a way to say "if a child has this class" via selector
[05:34:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: we don't need to change this in buttonMarkup, I was wrong
[05:34:57] <toddmparker_> no?
[05:35:05] <uGoMobi> we can change it in theme.css
[05:35:12] <toddmparker_> ah, true
[05:35:43] <toddmparker_> i bet people would really like to use this, we just never made it easy or explained it
[05:35:44] <uGoMobi> and when you set the .ui-icon-alt class on the container the .ui-icon background will be overridden
[05:36:05] <arschmitz> i really like that idea
[05:36:10] <toddmparker_> cool
[05:36:11] <uGoMobi> you want this for 1.3 or too late?
[05:36:28] <toddmparker_> looks like I need to touch up those icons, the bars look a bit ragged on the left and such
[05:36:35] <toddmparker_> hate hate hate sprites
[05:36:40] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:36:50] <toddmparker_> let's try and add it today, just a bit of css
[05:37:09] <uGoMobi> have to change it in the TR too
[05:37:14] <arschmitz>  technically i think it would be 1.4 because its a new feature 
[05:37:16] <uGoMobi> but that needs to be updated anyway
[05:37:19] <arschmitz> but its pretty minor
[05:37:22] <toddmparker_> that said, i'd like to see if we can get whatever fixes we want to land in 1.3 by tomorrow. pencils down :)
[05:37:41] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: think that will just happen in TR. they grab the css for each release
[05:38:42] <toddmparker_> it's really minor code-wise. we always had this class, it just wasn't scoped so it was easy to apply
[05:38:57] <toddmparker_> or well documented :)
[05:39:12] <toddmparker_> i gotta hop off for a bit but will be on later
[05:39:25] <uGoMobi> you can only use the -alt class if you dynamically add it
[05:39:43] <uGoMobi> I will change it to .ui-icon-alt .ui-icon
[05:40:05] <uGoMobi> so that if -alt is on the container .ui-icon will be overridden
[05:40:13] <arschmitz> cool
[05:42:50] <uGoMobi> but I do think we need to make some small changes to TR to make sure default and alt both get the correct bg-img url
[05:43:04] <uGoMobi>  also have to keep in mind people can update there theme to new version
[05:43:30] <arschmitz> ohhh hmm not sure how that will work
[05:43:44] <uGoMobi> it's a regex
[05:44:13] <arschmitz> ok
[05:44:25] <arschmitz> ic never even looked at the themeroller repo yet lol
[05:44:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: what was the idea of your tweaks? http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/widgets/icons/
[05:46:44] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: nevermind, I think I got it
[05:46:49] <uGoMobi> will fix it
[05:50:27] <uGoMobi> actually there is nothing to fix... just needed to reload the page :/
[05:50:45] <uGoMobi> that styles and scripts is not really convenient
[05:51:10] <uGoMobi> I can imagine we are going to forget adding data-ajax="false" on some links
[05:51:51] <uGoMobi> I am going to change view source so at least <style> can be in the body
[05:52:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: is there any reason we wouldnt just disable ajax nav on the front page?
[05:53:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we could do that and also in the panel nav menu
[05:53:18] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:53:36] <arschmitz> then you dont need to worry about it so much
[05:53:37] <uGoMobi> but we will probably going to add links at other places as well at some point
[05:54:01] <uGoMobi> from FAQ answer to a demo or something
[05:54:13] <arschmitz> yeah
[05:54:41] <arschmitz> he could just disable it everywhere and only enable it where needed?
[05:54:58] <uGoMobi> yeah maybe that's better
[05:55:14] <uGoMobi> other issue is that nav panel has an ID
[05:55:21] <uGoMobi> which won't be unique
[05:55:35] <uGoMobi> if multiple pages in the DOM
[05:55:41] <arschmitz> yeah for the most part is should funtion but its not really right by any means
[05:56:04] <uGoMobi> yeah, we have to set good example
[05:56:29] <arschmitz> yup
[05:56:36] <uGoMobi> give that a look later
[05:56:49] <arschmitz> have to be careful on pages that did enable it though
[05:57:15] <arschmitz> because you wouldnt want someone to then go from those to a regular page with out ajax false
[05:57:31] <arschmitz> because global config on the page loaded is ignored
[05:57:52] <uGoMobi> true
[06:02:13] <arschmitz> yeah its a no win either way
[06:02:19] <arschmitz> and we just need to be carefull
[06:03:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but considdering the number of pages that will need ajax nav a fairly limited compared to the overall number of pages it might be best to still turn of globaly 
[06:03:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: probably a question to discuss with toddmparker: too
[06:03:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes I agree
[06:04:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: besides... AJAX doesn't always work local
[06:04:28] <arschmitz> yup
[06:04:38] <arschmitz> it does not work at all in the zip download

[06:20:04] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: yep, that is exactly what I was thinking
[06:20:37] <toddmparker_> wonder if the same scoping should apply to the disc and shadow classes too
[06:20:38] <uGoMobi> there is a weird issue
[06:20:52] <uGoMobi> you get to see the wrong icon
[06:21:10] <toddmparker_> actually, on that icon page, i still see the white icon
[06:21:13] <toddmparker_> yeah
[06:21:32] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I didn't update the demo page yet
[06:21:38] <uGoMobi> looking at this issue
[06:21:46] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[06:21:58] <uGoMobi> ui-icon-alt doesn't affect bg-position and I do see the right bg-pos in the code inspector
[06:21:59] <toddmparker_> think this is the right idea though
[06:22:08] <uGoMobi> but still it applies 0% 0%
[06:22:13] <toddmparker_> huh, interesting
[06:23:09] <toddmparker_> alright, hopping on the subway, be on in 45
[06:24:46] <toddmparker_> think i agree on the ajax stuff but want to mull it over
[06:28:27] <uGoMobi> ok problem resolved.. it was caused by using background shorthand property

[07:28:54] <arschmitz> Hey toddmparker
[07:31:29] <Wilto> Morning, all.
[07:37:19] <arschmitz> toddmparker: when you have a minute need to run something by you with deeplinks and hash only browsers
[07:53:47] <Wilto> Uh-oh. Whassup?
[07:54:09] <RWhitbeck> Morning, everyone. 
[07:58:42] <Wilto> That “uh oh” was for you, arschmitz.
[07:58:50] <Wilto> We break somethin’?
[07:59:02] <arschmitz> Wilto: no its about a new feature
[07:59:03] <Wilto> “We” read “I.”
[07:59:07] <Wilto> Oh, sweet.
[07:59:17] <arschmitz> Morning RWhitbeck
[07:59:39] <arschmitz> Wilto: im sure i can make it your fault if you really want though
[07:59:54] <Wilto> arschmitz: I think I’d be more comfortable that way, actually.
[08:00:20] <arschmitz> Wilto: you clearly should have made this feature already so that fact that i need to talk to toddmparker: about it at all is clearly your fault!
[08:00:36] <Wilto> DAMMIT, WILTO
[08:00:39] <arschmitz> Wilto: does that make you feel more comfortable
[08:02:11] <Wilto> It does.
[08:02:15] <arschmitz> good
[08:02:26] <arschmitz> i can tell you how its all your fault in person tomorrow if you want
[08:02:37] <Wilto> Paying the office a visit?
[08:02:41] <arschmitz> yup
[08:03:59] <arschmitz> Wilto: i still have that smashed blueberry i promissed you if you want it lol
[08:05:39] <Wilto> Hell yes.
[08:05:47] <Wilto> I mean “oh, sure.”
[08:23:35] <arschmitz> lol
[08:24:18] <arschmitz> Wilto: is there any parking around you guys i didnt see any on google maps was thinking ill be best parking outside the city and taking the subway?
[08:40:59] <Wilto> arschmitz: There’s parking at South Station, but toddmparker might know better than I do. I haven’t driven in like half a decade.
[08:41:12] <arschmitz> lol ok
[08:54:14] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yep, south station has a garage on the roof
[08:54:26] <toddmparker> kinda odd to get into so look at directions
[08:54:32] <arschmitz> oh cool
[08:54:43] <toddmparker> it's kidna pricy tho - $20
[08:55:04] <toddmparker> there is a smart park lot further away in fort point that is a lot cheaper
[08:55:11] <toddmparker> but it's a 15 minute walk
[08:55:20] <toddmparker> take the T!
[08:55:34] <arschmitz> i normally park at like sullivan square
[08:55:39] <arschmitz> and take the T
[08:56:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker: so same idea
[08:58:12] <toddmparker> yeah
[08:58:21] <toddmparker> get off at chinatown
[08:58:24] <toddmparker> or dtc
[08:59:35] <arschmitz> yeah that was the plan
[09:00:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i need to go to bocoup tomorrow too which is a walk but it looked like im best off just walking there for your place
[09:00:32] <Wilto> Yeah; only a couple blocks away.
[09:00:55] <arschmitz> yeah google maps said like just under a mile not bad
[09:05:17] <arschmitz> Wilto: toddmparker: seems like you should have some sort of office rivalry with Bocoup lol 
[09:05:33] <Wilto> The rap battles get pretty out of control.
[09:06:07] <arschmitz> Wilto: Ha Ha nice
[09:29:02] <johnbender> jzaefferer: are you around?
[10:47:55] <toddmparker> arschmitz: we are very close to bocoup
[10:48:15] <arschmitz> yeah i looked on google maps and it looked it thats why i was just going to walk
[10:48:26] <toddmparker> parking is way easier down there
[10:48:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker: got a second to talk deeplinks and hash only browsers
[10:49:22] <toddmparker> sure, in a meeting but can talk
[10:49:44] <arschmitz> ok basicly what i think we should do is well nothing lol
[10:49:52] <toddmparker> sold
[10:50:03] <arschmitz> if i make no changes at all and just do as i was already going to what will happen is
[10:50:09] <arschmitz> they will get the function
[10:50:16] <arschmitz> it will still scroll to the id and work fine
[10:50:21] <arschmitz> but the url just wont update
[10:51:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: went over it all with johnbender and he is onboard 100% said he thought my approach is very well thought out and perfect for progressive enhancement
[10:52:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: so i just wanted to make sure you were ok with it
[10:53:14] <toddmparker> mind a quick recap
[10:53:33] <toddmparker> these are for the anchor links
[10:53:39] <arschmitz> yup
[10:53:46] <toddmparker> just internal or deep links across pages?
[10:53:50] <arschmitz> everything will work like native like we talked about
[10:53:52] <arschmitz> both
[10:53:56] <toddmparker> cool
[10:54:07] <toddmparker> local is just href="#foo"
[10:54:10] <arschmitz> the only catch is on browsers that are hash only
[10:54:12] <arschmitz> yup
[10:54:18] <toddmparker> with data-ajax="false"
[10:54:20] <arschmitz> the url wont update
[10:54:26] <toddmparker> fine
[10:54:29] <arschmitz> nope no data ajax false
[10:54:48] <toddmparker> nice, simple
[10:54:51] <arschmitz> you will make it just like you would any normal link in any other page
[10:55:06] <arschmitz> if you want it to scroll down to #foo you do href="#foo"
[10:55:16] <toddmparker> so if it's a local page, change page, if not then scroll to
[10:55:27] <arschmitz> if you want to go to options.html and then scroll to #foo
[10:55:32] <arschmitz> you do options.html#foo
[10:55:35] <arschmitz> yup
[10:55:40] <toddmparker> perfect
[10:55:54] <arschmitz> also need to check if its a panel or popup or dialog not just page but yeah thats the idea
[10:56:04] <toddmparker> does the nav pull off the #foo 
[10:56:09] <toddmparker> right
[10:56:20] <arschmitz> what nav does
[10:56:34] <arschmitz> is in page before change it will save the hash
[10:57:02] <arschmitz> and once the pagechange is complete it will see if the id belongs to a page/popup/dialog/panel and if not scroll
[10:57:09] <toddmparker> will the url be options.html#foo or just options.html
[10:57:24] <toddmparker> if i paste it into my browser
[10:57:27] <arschmitz> options.html#foo if push state is enabled
[10:57:34] <toddmparker> cool
[10:57:46] <toddmparker> so it's easy to copy and paste that URL
[10:57:50] <arschmitz> yup
[10:58:00] <toddmparker> perfect. awesome
[10:58:01] <arschmitz> and in hash only prowsers you could still paste the url
[10:58:12] <arschmitz> but it wont update so copy wouldnt work
[10:58:26] <toddmparker> sure, ok tradeoff
[10:58:26] <arschmitz> because it will always just be the url of the page without the hash
[10:58:32] <toddmparker> most support it now
[10:58:48] <arschmitz> yup i think its pretty much oldIE
[10:58:59] <arschmitz> and like old symbian / blackberry stuff
[10:59:25] <arschmitz> i think oldIE is the only a grade browser that does not support
[10:59:59] <arschmitz> and in b and c since there is no ajax anyway its not an issue
[11:00:08] <mspisars> arschmitz: then it should not be listed as grade A :)
[11:00:14] <mspisars> old IE that is 
[11:00:45] <arschmitz> mspisars: yeah thats a matter of debate since core is dropping support for it with 2.0
[11:01:12] <mspisars> nice... 
[11:01:15] <arschmitz> mspisars: but right now to be a grade it just has to support ajax nav 
[11:01:18] <mspisars> i mean ... too bad!
[11:01:58] <arschmitz> lol
[11:02:07] <mspisars> by oldIE do you mean 7 or 8 or 9?
[11:02:29] <mspisars> sad that 10 is not out for Win7 and I think 9 is old :/
[11:02:42] <arschmitz> well right now we define oldIE as 7,8,9 but for dropiing it would just be 7,8
[11:03:52] <mspisars> that would be fantastic to be able to say framework does not support 7 or 8 and neither do we!
[11:04:21] <mspisars> i mean in the context to my current customers
[11:04:28] <arschmitz> lol yeah i hate supporting 7 and 8 but they sadly still have substantial market share
[11:04:32] <mspisars> they are very stubborn about keeping old junk around.
[11:04:48] <mspisars> BoA is the reason 7 has any market share
[11:04:56] <arschmitz> its because if your on windows xp 8 is the newest you can get
[11:05:00] <mspisars> their internal browser is ie7 for ALL machines
[11:05:14] <mspisars> yeah, but no excuse of 7..
[11:05:20] <mspisars> but then again 7 ~ 8
[11:05:26] <mspisars> ~=
[11:05:26] <arschmitz> mspisars: yeah i have a client with like 300 pcs internal all on 7 or 8
[11:06:43] <arschmitz> mspisars windows XP is the root of all current IE evil
[11:07:18] <mspisars> yes, we have 2 machines (HP) with XP just so we can test/troubleshoot crap for our customers.
[11:07:46] <arschmitz> i cant believe they were so dumb as to not make ie9 work on xp
[11:08:02] <arschmitz> every other modern browser works fine on xp
[11:08:14] <mspisars> no, then you would see win xp around in 2020
[11:08:20] <arschmitz> not that i like 9 either but the improvment over 8 is substantial
[11:08:25] <arschmitz> lol
[11:08:41] <mspisars> this kinda forces their hand
[11:08:51] <mspisars> and they have to now go, either to Win 7 or 8
[11:08:54] <arschmitz> i cant wait for the end of the XP support cycle
[11:09:05] <arschmitz> but i think its like 2016
[11:09:21] <mspisars> if they don't want have 'great security risk' with their machines.
[11:09:42] <mspisars> i think that is bs
[11:09:44] <mspisars> 2016
[11:09:51] <arschmitz> oh they changed it!!

[11:15:30] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15ChadPrice opened issue #5555: Test input placeholder not visible in IE 7/ 8  02http://git.io/LgSrSQ
[11:26:15] <johnbender> toddmparker: arschmitz's solution sounds good eh?
[11:34:52] <arschmitz> johnbender:  i come up with a good idea once in a while lol
[11:35:11] <johnbender> arschmitz: that's how I feel most of the time
[11:35:15] <johnbender> few and far between :)
[12:00:19] <arschmitz> lol yea im always suprised when i do lol
[12:01:05] <arschmitz> johnbender: feel like it just means i overlooked something lol
[12:01:49] <johnbender> :)
[12:16:19] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_: new info on the test failures
[12:16:26] <johnbender> it's only on redirect based tests
[12:17:18] <arschmitz> hmm any idea what the issue is?
[12:18:05] <johnbender> arschmitz: it's just the order in which the qunit hacks from grunt are injected
[12:18:36] <johnbender> they do all the reporting back to grunt on test progress
[12:18:42] <johnbender> so the tests run but there's no report
[12:19:00] <johnbender> something changed between releases in how/when the injection happened
[12:19:04] <arschmitz> i see
[12:34:09] <toddmparker> johnbender: heck yeah. really miss anchors
[12:35:01] <toddmparker> arschmitz and johnbender - what's the ETA on that? we planning on adding it for 1.3 or wait til 1.4
[12:35:22] <johnbender> toddmparker: 1.4 it drops pushstate support for ios
[12:35:30] <johnbender> err
[12:35:32] <johnbender> ios 4
[12:35:48] <johnbender> or that was the last we discussed about that particular bit
[12:42:12] <arschmitz> yes
[12:43:35] <arschmitz> johnbender: i think you sad said since it changes url handling in some cases that it should be 1.4 for sure right?
[12:43:46] <arschmitz> and since it also drops ios4
[12:47:52] <johnbender> it's also a feature :)
[12:48:18] <johnbender> and I was hopefull that we would be feature frozen for 1.3 at this point
[12:52:49] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah but you could leave the other feature out but make the changes to make it possible
[12:53:04] <arschmitz> make the change to the binding and to go
[12:53:19] <arschmitz> but leave out the beforechangepage 
[12:54:05] <arschmitz> johnbender: then for like the docs and for other people it could be possible by adding a plugin.
[12:54:42] <arschmitz> johnbender: but that would assume you would think it was ok to drop ios4 support in pushstate and make the change to linkbinding after beta
[12:55:05] <johnbender> which I'm against :)
[12:55:37] <arschmitz> johnbender: right i was just saying i dont think the feature is the issue its the other changes
[12:55:58] <johnbender> right it *is* an issue if we include it in this release
[12:56:05] <arschmitz> right
[12:56:41] <arschmitz> i agree it shouldnt be in 1.3 i wasent saying it should be lol
[12:59:17] <arschmitz> johnbender: my plan was to make it now in a branch. and as soon as we release 1.3 ill merge the branch so we can use it in the demos
[13:00:13] <arschmitz> johnbender: i also did think of a way to do it until then in demos
[13:01:04] <arschmitz> we just need to bind the click events before jqm gets the chance so we can handle it ourselves in the demos
[13:06:12] <JasonDScott___> Hey guys should this line https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/fixedToolbar.js#L117 be contained in the if statement on the next line?
[13:09:43] <arschmitz> JasonDScott___: i guess thats a matter of interpertation
[13:09:49] <arschmitz> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/toolbars/bars-fixed-options.html
[13:10:17] <arschmitz> jasonDScott: it says there it turns of the update "durring many operations" 
[13:10:41] <arschmitz> it does not say completely and where it is it only does this once when the page is first shown
[13:11:19] <arschmitz> and never binds to throttledresize to update then
[13:16:38] <JasonDScott___> arschmitz: ok... thanks.  seems odd though. I will have to do some more digging
[13:17:05] <arschmitz> JasonDScott___: im not saying its wrong or right im just saying it does not actually specifiy 
[13:21:26] <JasonDScott___> arschmitz:  agreed. My initial assumption, (based on the event name) was that this was going to disable it completely though
[13:22:07] <arschmitz> JasonDScott___: yeah i agree i could see the other side too the because the option makes it sound like its for performace
[13:22:21] <arschmitz> and performance isnt an issue to only do it once on page show its the resize
[13:22:44] <arschmitz> really should have thought that through and better documented to start i guess lol
[13:25:04] <JasonDScott___> I might be disabling for the wrong reasons atm
[13:26:43] <JasonDScott___> For the BlackBerry 10 theme the fixed toolbar is not at the bottom of the page because of the page padding
[13:27:22] <JasonDScott___> that is set by updatePagePadding
[13:27:41] <arschmitz> shouldnt a fixed toolbar be at window bottom regardless of padding
[13:28:04] <arschmitz> position:fixed; should not care about padding
[13:31:19] <JasonDScott___> agreed. but it appears to be :|
[13:31:34] <arschmitz> JasonDScott___: if you want to disable it for now do this https://gist.github.com/4668074
[13:32:27] <arschmitz> it overwrites that method so it will not ever make that call to updatePagePadding
[13:33:04] <arschmitz> though im not convinced we should not fix this to work the way you assumed either
[13:33:06] <JasonDScott___> Thanks. Overkill but it will get the job done. 
[13:33:40] <JasonDScott___> Ya, I am going to have digg a bit more and get a proper test case
[13:34:31] <arschmitz> JasonDScott___: ill bring it up at the meeting thursday if your not around 
[13:35:19] <JasonDScott___> I will be in Amsterdam but I will try to join
[13:35:25] <arschmitz> JasonDScott___: because blackberry issue aside this needs to be clarified / fixed one way or the other

[13:37:24] <JasonDScott___> Hey uGoMobi

[14:17:21] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 143ba8490 15John Bender: upgrade grunt-junit to support redirects in 1.8
[14:18:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: I sorted out the issue with the grunt qunit library
[14:18:45] <johnbender> gseguin: you around?
[14:18:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: awesome
[14:19:08] <gseguin> johnbender: 'sup?
[14:19:16] <johnbender> ?tell gseguin just make sure when you run the test suite you run it with phantom 1.8 and hit the tests that use a redirect
[14:19:17] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[14:19:40] <johnbender> gseguin: the new qunit stuff in grunt is totally different
[14:19:47] <johnbender> gseguin: but it may not address the redirect issue 
[14:19:54] <johnbender> (which is what was stalling those tests)
[14:19:56] <gseguin> the default phantom with grunt-contrib-qunit is 1.7 I think
[14:19:56] <bot-t> (40 secs ago) <johnbender> tell gseguin just make sure when you run the test suite you run it with phantom 1.8 and hit the tests that use a redirect
[14:20:13] <johnbender> gseguin: the swarm server has 1.8 installed
[14:20:24] <johnbender> gseguin: so there's a chance it may not work with what they have
[14:20:42] <johnbender> gseguin: I know how to solve the issue so if you run into problems let me know and maybe we can submit a PR
[14:21:00] <gseguin> ok, let talk with the maintainers of grunt-contrib-qunit to see when they  plan to update their requirements
[14:21:08] <gseguin> I will
[14:21:26] <johnbender> gseguin: cool, even if they update the requirements I doubt they test with redirects
[14:21:39] <johnbender> but that sounds like a plan
[14:21:54] <johnbender> gseguin: also I talked with scott_gonzalez and they are waiting for a stable 0.4 before migrating
[14:22:06] <gseguin> oh yeah?
[14:22:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What issue was that? /me is forgetful, sorry :(
[14:22:19] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the tests were timing out
[14:22:25] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hopefully no longer
[14:22:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, really? That was a qunit issue?
[14:22:30] <gseguin> probably because of the plugins not all working with .4 yet
[14:22:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it was a grunt issue
[14:22:46] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[14:22:58] <johnbender> gseguin: well and there were some serious changes at rc4 or some such
[14:23:00] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, wow! I was afraid it had something to do with detailedEventCascade ...
[14:23:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: newp
[14:23:11] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, *whew*
[14:23:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: just redirects and phantom 1.8
[14:23:18] * _|Nix|_ is off the hook ...
[14:23:22] <johnbender> gseguin: so we might wait to merge
[14:23:30] <gseguin> ok, I'll try to keep a close eye on what's going on with grunt
[14:23:31] <johnbender> gseguin: but the works is still valuable
[14:23:34] <johnbender> gseguin: kewl
[14:23:36] <gseguin> sounds safer indeed
[14:24:13] <gseguin> yeah I think I got rid of a lot of complexity and mostly I got rid of Makefile and shell scripts
[14:24:19] <arschmitz> gseguin: does this mean you could use one of the plugins we talked about for including those php files?
[14:24:46] <_|Nix|_> Gah! I'm still getting "pure virtual method called" even with phantomjs 1.7.0 ... must be this Fedora 18 thing ...
[14:24:55] <gseguin> arschmitz: yeah once the authors have upgraded to 0.4
[14:25:35] <arschmitz> gseguin: no i mean before then since we are going to hold off on upgrading to .4 for the moment?
[14:26:17] <gseguin> arschmitz: I'm not going to spend any time on the current build system since we're going to replace it sooner than later
[14:26:32] <arschmitz> gseguin: ok
[14:26:59] <mspisars> you guys moving to gruntjs?
[14:27:16] <gseguin> mspisars: we already are using it
[14:27:24] <arschmitz> johnbender: the timeouts are fixed but there are other failures now
[14:27:32] <gseguin> mspisars: though we use it through Makefile
[14:27:40] <mspisars> ahh
[14:27:43] <johnbender> ack
[14:27:51] <johnbender> arschmitz: I accidentally commited those tests

[14:45:23] <arschmitz> ha ha
[14:45:55] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i keep thinking about your hotel california ending quote comments and seeing WAY TOO MANY ways in which it applies lol

[14:46:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Those guys were prescient!
[14:46:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its how you joined and you feel as if your trapped by it
[14:46:39] <arschmitz> its also essentially the issue we were talking about
[14:46:43] <arschmitz> "trapping focus"
[14:47:02] <arschmitz> that issue was the first thing i ever spoke to you about
[14:47:09] <arschmitz> and we were back around to it

[14:52:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do I smell Nostradamus 2.0?
[14:52:45] <arschmitz> ha ha
[14:53:13] <arschmitz> we just need to input the song as a string
[14:53:24] <arschmitz> and design a massive regex 
[14:53:46] <arschmitz> to pull it apart and look for paterns that coinside with lines in our code
[14:54:31] <arschmitz> then we can plot the intersections of song and code and develop a formula 
[14:55:02] <arschmitz> the formula will output line file and line numbers
[14:55:18] <arschmitz> which we will print out and place in a hat
[14:55:25] <arschmitz> and have wilto pick at random 
[14:55:33] <_|Nix|_> LOL :)
[14:56:16] <arschmitz> It's so cool and complex and random its sure to predict something
[14:56:28] <arschmitz> (even if it is our own decent into madness)
[14:57:19] <_|Nix|_> That much it is certain to predict :)
[14:59:14] <uGoMobi> I was looking at this ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5541

[15:00:10] <uGoMobi> johnbender arschmitz _|Nix|_ ^^
[15:00:41] <arschmitz> i would say so
[15:00:42] <uGoMobi> Re issue 2... I don't understand :)
[15:00:50] <arschmitz> i had look briefly but not familier with angular
[15:00:57] <uGoMobi> neither am I
[15:01:35] <uGoMobi> but don't like tickets like this to stay open too long
[15:02:02] <uGoMobi> because then they will probably still be open next year :)
[15:02:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i would point them to the config options
[15:02:20] <arschmitz> and and close
[15:02:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah. The guy can turn off all of jQM's history tracking and manipulation, and just use the enhancement stuff.
[15:02:54] <arschmitz> and even enhancement he can avoide
[15:03:28] <uGoMobi> does anyone understand that second issue?
[15:03:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's ask.
[15:03:55] <uGoMobi> ok good idea
[15:04:03] <uGoMobi> I will comment
[15:04:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I already asked.
[15:04:47] <uGoMobi> ah ok thanks
