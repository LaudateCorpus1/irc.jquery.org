[02:51:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5386 - we never set text-overflow: ellipsis in selects.
[02:52:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It seems to be the default on iOS, but perhaps not WP7 ...
[02:52:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we do
[02:52:24] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: .ui-select .ui-btn-text { text-overflow: ellipsis; }
[02:52:41] <uGoMobi> and we set it global for ui-btn-inner
[02:53:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Is that inherited though, because the text inside a select button is in an extra span inside .ui-btn-text ...
[02:53:09] <_|Nix|_> ?
[02:53:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am checking -ms-text-overflow now, but doesn't seem to work either
[02:53:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and chrome dev tools is telling me that the computed value is clip.
[02:54:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It is indeed set to ellipsis for .ui-btn-text, but the span inside .ui-btn-text does not seem to inherit that.
[02:54:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... or we stop using the inside span ...
[02:55:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... I think we're using the inside span because .ui-btn-text is added by buttonMarkup ... we should set the text-overflow for the inside span to "inherit".
[02:55:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think this needs to be fixed in JS ...
[02:55:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: span is an inline element, so it should still get ellipsis if it is set for parent span
[02:56:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just tested .ui-select .ui-btn-text span { text-overflow: ellipsis;  -ms-text-overflow: ellipsis;} and doesn't work either
[02:57:00] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: let see what we can do with CSS first
[02:57:19] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: maybe no ellipsis but at least make it not break the page
[02:58:30] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: BTW - I posted a new JS Bin template using core 1.8.3 in the contributing guidelines, yours is on 1.8.2
[02:59:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, sorry ... I memorized the slug ...
[03:00:06] <_|Nix|_> I'll try to remember the new slug for next time.
[03:04:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's not a big deal... just help you to keep up-to-date ;-)
[03:05:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I already see the problem with the ellipsis

[03:06:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's the table the select is wrapped in
[03:20:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Great! So not our code *wipe hands*
[03:20:42] <_|Nix|_> :)
[03:20:48] <uGoMobi> :D
[03:22:21] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender We're setting initialDst in two places: js/navigation/history.js:14 and js/jquery.mobile.init.js:104. I think the latter should be gone, but I don't wanna touch anything at this point. If you think we can bear the modification, I'll yank the latter.
[03:22:22] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.

[04:35:33] <_|Nix|_> K, so is it just me or are transitions still messed up when the source page is not panned all the way to the top?
[04:35:55] <_|Nix|_> I thought it was being caused by popups, and it still may be, but it looks bad.
[04:37:48] <_|Nix|_> It's like scollfaaaaaaaaade. And when you hit "Back", it's Bam!faaaaaaaade.
[04:57:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: what page did you test?
[05:00:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you mean the address bar is not completely hidden?
[05:05:29] <arschmitz> Morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi:
[05:05:40] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:10:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you see my comment on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5359
[05:11:39] <arschmitz> it does not explain ie9 or the problems with some chrome but explains the jsbin tests
[05:16:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and actually it works fine for me on ie9
[05:18:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw your comment... good one!
[05:18:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: what did you test ie9 on?
[05:18:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: IE9 works now
[05:18:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok so that one can be closed then i guess
[05:18:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: Wilto already committed a fix for that issue
[05:19:00] <arschmitz> oh ok 
[05:19:11] <uGoMobi> let's look up the commit
[05:19:30] <uGoMobi> and close the issue, referring to the commit
[05:19:52] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/f07107827fed2c939eba2783fceaa2f85aeee359
[05:20:31] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I thought all support extended $.mobile 
[05:20:42] <uGoMobi> not sure why we only do this for touch
[05:20:58] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah im not sure why its like that
[05:21:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: tests/functional/hashchange/hashchange.html
[05:21:18] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what's the difference? $.support is not supposed to be public?
[05:21:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Open the collapsible, then go to another page.
[05:21:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: iv noticed it when you mentioned it to me before but it wasent super visible for me
[05:22:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok lemme test
[05:22:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Basically, if a link to a page that needs to be AJAX-ed in is located such that you need to scroll to it, you get the jump.
[05:23:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think this is a pretty old issue.
[05:23:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not really sure the reason for how we are doing this i was just looking into why the tests were failing and found that was the reason
[05:23:40] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah ok
[05:23:52] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15ryanki1 opened issue #5387: Switching off jQuery Mobile enhancement interferes with HTTP FORM POST values  02http://git.io/LV2y0w
[05:23:54] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that is suposed to be fixed by silentscroll top and us fading to white to hide the scroll
[05:24:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: not sure johnbender saw other issues with the those support test, otherwise we can close
[05:24:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, it's visible on my Chrome 23.0.1271.97
[05:24:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Are we fading to white and then silent scrolling?
[05:25:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: two seperate issues johnbender isnt getting transitions on chrome like nix iv seen this issue other places too
[05:25:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah but there is a minimum scroll distance
[05:25:41] <arschmitz> so if you only scroll a little i think it doesnt do it
[05:25:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I see, yeah I think there is already a ticket for that... not sure if it's still open
[05:25:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, OK.
[05:26:14] <arschmitz> uGoMobi you refrence it in that issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5092
[05:26:19] <uGoMobi> 14:21 <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Open the collapsible, then go to another page. >> you mean the popup?
[05:27:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I was actually thinking about this ticket https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3680
[05:28:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah that one is better
[05:28:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i ran into this with a client and found the issue and i have a test page for it im trying to find
[05:28:48] <arschmitz> in their case it was a hardware issue
[05:29:11] <uGoMobi> i have seen it on windows on old laptop
[05:29:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: same here
[05:29:31] <arschmitz> chrome in XP doesnt support 3d transform
[05:29:39] <arschmitz> its blacklisted
[05:29:45] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:29:57] <arschmitz> also these video cards http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/chrome/trunk/src/chrome/browser/resources/gpu_blacklist.json?revision=75130&view=markup&pathrev=75130

[05:30:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you dont get transitions right?
[05:30:44] <arschmitz> in chrome you only get fade?
[05:30:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes.
[05:30:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Never had any transitions in Chrome.
[05:31:02] <arschmitz> check this page and see if it passes 3d css chrome://gpu/
[05:31:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe my video card doesn't qualify me for transitions.
[05:31:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: that page will tell you if its a hardware accelerated
[05:31:38] <arschmitz> if its not you dont pass and dont get them
[05:31:58] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm "Hardware acceleration unavailable" ...
[05:32:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Hurra!
[05:32:29] <arschmitz> its your computer not us
[05:32:42] <arschmitz> so far everytime iv run into this that has been the case
[05:32:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know ... I don't get it though ... my glxinfo says I do have direct rendering ...
[05:33:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I bet it's Chrome being conservative.
[05:33:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah im not sure but chrome is saying you dont support them hence why you dont get them
[05:33:37] <arschmitz> it could be a setting too
[05:33:52] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know. I get it. The detection is working correctly. Still, I'd like to change Chrome's mind.
[05:34:00] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: because like johnbender had them before but now dosent 
[05:34:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Maybe I need to look into getting hardware acceleration to work in Chrome.
[05:34:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah id say that would be where to start
[05:35:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im curious what johnbender will get for results because hes on a mac that 100% should pass im pretty sure
[05:35:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: and he said he got them before
[05:37:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[05:37:19] <arschmitz> im going to hold off commenting or closing untill i see what he gets but im pretty sure we can close as not an issue
[05:37:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: might be useful to post chrome://gpu/ link in a comment at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5092
[05:37:50] <uGoMobi> if it doesn't pass h.a. test we can close the ticket as won't fix
[05:38:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think that is yet another issue but yea i think that one too
[05:38:38] <arschmitz> that one wilto noticed on his retina specific to chrome 22
[05:38:54] <arschmitz>  https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3680 is the real issue for this i think
[05:39:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I do see the issue on tests/functional/hashchange/hashchange.html
[05:39:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but i think that both can probably be closed because 5092 is a chrome issue not a jqm issue
[05:40:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi, arschmitz: When I change things in chrome://flags, do I need to restart chrome?
[05:40:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I've changed some things that look like they're 3D CSS related, but it doesn't seem to make a difference/
[05:40:30] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: im not entirely sure im on windows too so might be different for me
[05:40:31] <_|Nix|_> .
[05:41:46] <_|Nix|_> I'm an idiot: "Your changes will take effect the next time you relaunch Google Chrome."
[05:41:57] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: :)
[05:42:52] <uGoMobi> lol

[05:46:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: nope no outgoing transition here either
[05:46:21] <_|Nix|_> Woah! I'm interrupting the transition!
[05:46:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ill check 1.2
[05:46:28] <_|Nix|_> Not good.
[05:46:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nono. Definite regression.
[05:46:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yup they work on 1.2 perfect
[05:47:00] <_|Nix|_> I thought something like this might happen.
[05:47:06] <_|Nix|_> I need to compare with an absolute URL.
[05:47:21] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: see what happens get you transitions and now you find problems ha ha 
[05:47:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: :-S
[05:49:11] <_|Nix|_> I'm beginning to see why they're turned off. I get lots of visual artifacts.
[05:49:37] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: stupid people at google trying to improve user experience lol
[05:49:41] <_|Nix|_> Like, closing a slideup/slidedown popup leaves a copy of it on the page.
[05:49:56] <_|Nix|_> I'm not a user though, dammit!
[05:50:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: how do you like this "test page" https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5387
[05:52:05] <arschmitz> all we have to do is get visual stuid then create an mvc4 app and add in his stuff then add some break points and examin the params?
[05:52:26] <_|Nix|_> A walk in the park.
[05:52:40] <_|Nix|_> I'll answer. I feel inspired.
[05:52:43] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:52:53] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: all you
[05:54:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: good god visual stuid 2012 is expensive $500

[05:55:41] <arschmitz> or a tiny $13,790 w/MSDN
[05:57:04] <_|Nix|_> I think I might have lied when I said "Unfortunately" in my comment.

[06:07:58] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5301
[06:08:24] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh _|Nix|_ and i looked at this with gnarf a while ago
[06:08:33] <uGoMobi> and?
[06:08:52] <uGoMobi> easy or complicated?
[06:09:00] <arschmitz> complicated
[06:09:05] <uGoMobi> right

[06:09:33] <uGoMobi> i was a bit too enthousiastic
[06:09:50] <arschmitz> it comes down to the whole issue of theme inheritance and how we are going to deal with it

[08:39:42] <johnbender> arschmitz: running 12.04 here, not a mac
[08:39:42] <bot-t> (5 hours 17 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender We're setting initialDst in two places: js/navigation/history.js:14 and js/jquery.mobile.init.js:104. I think the latter should be gone, but I don't wanna touch anything at this point. If you think we can bear the modification, I'll yank the latter.
[08:39:43] <johnbender> :)
[08:39:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool
[08:40:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah I'm sure we can pull it
[08:40:35] <arschmitz> johnbender: chrome 12.04?
[08:40:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: ubuntu
[08:40:44] <arschmitz> oh oh ok
[08:40:55] <arschmitz> i was gonna say well that explains everything
[08:41:02] <johnbender> lolol
[08:41:25] <arschmitz> johnbender: go to chrome://gpu/ and see if you pass the 3d css test
[08:42:05] <arschmitz> seems like everyone that is not getting transitions in chrome its due to chrome saying your hardware isnt good enough
[08:42:45] <johnbender> 3dcss is green
[08:43:01] <johnbender> arschmitz: css animation is software though
[08:43:18] <arschmitz> johnbender: ahh maybe thats it for you then
[08:43:27] <johnbender> arschmitz: but it works
[08:43:35] <johnbender> it was working yesterday
[08:43:43] <johnbender> *after* I pointed out that it wasn't working
[08:43:46] <johnbender> o.O
[08:43:51] <johnbender> no code change
[08:44:19] <arschmitz> johnbender: wait so it worked you refreshed or what ever then it stopped working?
[08:44:31] <johnbender> arschmitz: not exactly but something like that
[08:44:35] <johnbender> let me check it again
[08:45:08] <johnbender> arschmitz: just worked
[08:45:12] <johnbender> the dialog popped
[08:45:26] <arschmitz> ok so must have just been some weird glitch or something?
[08:45:31] <johnbender> no
[08:45:33] <johnbender> fucking
[08:45:34] <johnbender> clue
[08:45:39] <arschmitz> lol
[08:46:37] <arschmitz> ok well im going to comment on and close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3680 then because everyperson iv found that can reproduce this has failed tests
[08:46:45] <arschmitz> specificly the 3d css test
[08:47:29] <johnbender> arschmitz: alright, if I see it again I'll check the gpu page
[08:48:02] <arschmitz> cool we may want to note somewhere chrome on XP will never get transitions too lol chorome blacklists windows XP completely
[08:52:02] <johnbender> toddmparker: question
[08:52:15] <johnbender> looking at the panel api it looks like we're returning a promise?
[08:52:21] <johnbender> from the panel method?
[08:52:36] <toddmparker> sure johnbender 
[08:52:50] <toddmparker> in the re-factor, we removed all that
[08:52:57] <johnbender> toddmparker: ahh good
[08:53:05] <toddmparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel-refactor/docs/panels/index.html
[08:53:10] <toddmparker> refactor branch
[08:53:11] <johnbender> I'm like "we've left jquery land completely"
[08:53:16] <johnbender> toddmparker: I'm just lookin at the docs
[08:53:20] <johnbender> I assume they haven't been updated
[08:53:46] <toddmparker> is it on that page still ? ^^
[08:54:13] <johnbender> yah I cliked the link in twitter which is identical to that one
[08:54:36] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/slide-panel-refactor/js/widgets/panel.js
[08:55:23] <johnbender> toddmparker: cool
[08:55:34] <johnbender> toddmparker: is scott around for questioning?
[08:56:10] <toddmparker> raising scott...
[08:56:20] <johnbender> toddmparker: oh I only have one quick observation
[08:56:25] <johnbender> should I go through it you think?
[08:56:27] <johnbender> looks really clean
[08:56:42] <toddmparker> johnbender: as of today, we're 99% there
[08:56:49] <johnbender> cool
[08:56:53] <toddmparker> so it's a good time to start looking at the code and API
[08:57:02] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: did you push all your commits to range branch?
[08:57:05] <toddmparker> mostly css stuff now. and revising unit tests
[08:57:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: let me double check
[08:57:18] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker and johnbender 
[08:57:24] <toddmparker> if you haven't look at the table code too in master
[08:57:27] <toddmparker> hey uGoMobi 
[08:57:29] <johnbender> toddmparker: looks like the tests still use the promise
[08:57:43] <toddmparker> right, tests need to be re-done
[08:58:00] <toddmparker> zach is going to help with that today/tomorrow so we can land this
[08:58:18] <toddmparker> original version jeff made used promises for managing animation 
[08:58:26] <toddmparker> but we simplified a lot of stuff
[08:58:45] <johnbender> toddmparker: have him ping me if he wants suggestions wrt the events
[09:00:53] <toddmparker> johnbender: scottjehl__ is here, lurking

[09:04:53] <kryl> hi, how to add fresh new jquery code to the new page after using $.mobile.changePage ?
[09:04:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker: me too 
[09:05:29] <scottjehl__> johnbender: no - nice catch, thanks!

[09:06:17] <johnbender> we might actually be able to unit test that widget
[09:06:35] <johnbender> toddmparker: if zach is going to work on the tests definitely have him ping me
[09:06:39] <johnbender> unit tests
[09:06:40] <johnbender> we need more of them
[09:07:09] <johnbender> tha is
[09:07:19] <johnbender> that is
[09:07:26] <johnbender> as opposed to the integration tests we have now
[09:07:30] <johnbender> which are not in any way bad
[09:07:32] <johnbender> just different
[09:09:48] <toddmparker> johnbender: will do
[09:12:29] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: if you havent done anything with the js im going to push a change real quick
[09:12:42] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure, np
[09:13:51] <scottjehl__> johnbender thanks! nothing like a rewrite or 3 to get it to a better place :)
[09:14:03] <johnbender> scottjehl__: lol awesome
[09:14:37] <scottjehl__> it should be very testable, yeah. We might want to break out some of the class additions in open,create,close, but other than that it's pretty itemized
[09:14:56] <scottjehl__> everything is sync except for the animationcomplete events 
[09:14:57] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I made some tweaks to the sequence test file names to "follow convention" 
[09:15:59] <scottjehl__> johnbender: some other downsides will come out when/if we write a destroy method, as it has to touch lots of other things on the page, unfortunately
[09:16:34] <johnbender> scottjehl__: hmm, we should probably do that before releasing no?
[09:16:38] <scottjehl__> classes on the page element, wrapping the entire page contents in a div, and then many panels all talking to one page and one contents wrapper, so class removals have to be very qualified
[09:16:40] <johnbender> or use the _on method for bindings
[09:16:50] <scottjehl__> not just events
[09:16:52] <johnbender> ah
[09:16:54] <scottjehl__> but good tip
[09:16:56] <johnbender> cleanup

[09:20:32] <arschmitz> im in maine
[09:20:47] <johnbender> arschmitz: hmm ok
[09:20:55] <johnbender> maybe I'll just eat first
[09:21:05] <johnbender> arschmitz: let me sort out this thing I'm looking at right now 
[09:21:07] <arschmitz> i normally am on from like 9 or 10 untill mid night as well if thats better
[09:21:24] <johnbender> arschmitz: I'll be looking after my daughter then
[09:21:44] <arschmitz> johnbender: cool well anyway even if its not today no biggie 
[09:22:08] <johnbender> arschmitz: kk
[09:24:44] <scottjehl__> johnbender archmitsz I agree. I've just always felt conflicted about adding logic for destroy, having never needed to destroy a widget in my own work. I wish it could be an optional extension
[09:25:45] <johnbender> scottjehl__: well we remove pages from the dom all the time so if they have dependent widgets they should get cleaned up
[09:25:52] <johnbender> scottjehl__: but I see your point
[09:25:53] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: yeah i can understand that. We are trying to get inline with the UI stuff though
[09:26:05] <johnbender> our "widgets" aren't the same as the UI widgets in a lot of ways
[09:26:21] <johnbender> arschmitz: agree
[09:26:24] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: i have also used destroy on occasions though
[09:26:47] <arschmitz> and got particularly irratated at a widget that was missing it once too ha ha
[09:27:14] <scottjehl__> removing pages is valid - good point
[09:27:39] <johnbender> scottjehl__: I think of it like wrapping your js in a function literal, we do it to make sure we're playing nice with those around us
[09:28:12] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: there was also some talk a few weeks ago about destorying and initalizing widgets based on the equivilent of MQ's which is impossible to do with out a proper _destroy
[09:28:20] <johnbender> the jquery ecosystem is littered with plugins and librarys that just vomit into the void and let the dev figure it out
[09:28:23] <mspisars> also, when using with ember.js or backbone.js where big parts of the dom is changed on the fly, destroy is definitely needed to clean up. my 2 cents.
[09:28:38] <johnbender> mspisars: makes a good point
[09:28:48] <johnbender> libraries*
[09:29:07] <arschmitz> its pile on scottjehl__ hour lol

[09:41:51] <johnbender> arschmitz: alright, breakfast and then we'll chat when you havetime
[09:42:20] <arschmitz> johnbender: sounds good ill be heading to lunch soon too so thats perfect
[09:44:16] <scottjehl__> the use case here I'm not sure is common is destroying a panel without destroying its page
[09:44:31] <scottjehl__> destroying a page negates any need to do class removals
[09:44:45] <scottjehl__> and _on would likely cover our event troubles by default
[09:45:16] <scottjehl__> I'm just always weary of non-optional code being included that doesn't address the common use case is all
[09:45:27] <scottjehl__> but... I have never won that fight. :)
[09:46:27] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: Someone could potentially want to destroy the panel to replace it with something else based on who knows what
[09:46:56] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: ill admit im sure that would be pretty rare though
[09:47:45] <scottjehl__> that's all I'm saying. Things that someone might need sometimes should always go through the "should this be an extension?" thought process
[09:48:53] <arschmitz> you should take it up with scott_gonzalez: lol
[09:50:02] <scott_gonzalez> Uncommon things should stay out of the core of a plugin.
[09:50:34] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: we are talking about _destroy()
[09:51:05] <scott_gonzalez> Can you give me a summary of the discussion?
[09:51:06] <arschmitz> or the _destroy method for widgets in general i mean
[09:51:33] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: doesnt think the panel widget they are working on should have a _destroy method
[09:52:04] <scott_gonzalez> Why not?
[09:52:05] <arschmitz> because it would be pretty rare it would get used most likely
[09:52:22] <arschmitz> though there are usecases for it for sure
[09:52:41] <scottjehl__> eh, not quite correct. I'm just weary of baked-in code that isn't often used is all.
[09:52:52] <scottjehl__> I don't want to elevate this to the UI widget discussion level
[09:53:25] <scott_gonzalez> How is panel intended to be used?
[09:53:51] <scottjehl__> a sidebar on a website/app
[09:54:01] <scottjehl__> persistent, open close nav
[09:54:09] <mspisars> from outside perspective having a consistency in the widgets makes it easy to implement on top of 3rd party frameworks like ember.js / backbone.js and the like.
[09:54:42] <mspisars> they have hooks on insert/remove/reRender
[09:54:57] <mspisars> which if could be mapped to the widget methods makes implementation a breeze.
[09:55:00] <scottjehl__> I can think of many times when someone might destroy it. I'm just generally always weary of adding code (baked-in, non-optional) that doesn't address the common use case
[09:55:01] <mspisars> this is just one view.
[09:55:49] <johnbender> arschmitz: scottjehl__ I don't like the "we should do it because someone might want it" argument either
[09:55:55] <johnbender> in general
[09:56:27] <scottjehl__> ok. really, I shouldn't have mentioned it because I don't even think destroy is the main issue here. It's just that we increasingly see jankiness as a result of doing more things than a low-powered device can handle, and if those things are done to satisfy a minority use case, that's disappointing
[09:56:35] <johnbender> obviously where an exposed api is concerened it's super important but internally it's a valid argument too
[09:56:53] <johnbender> scottjehl__: absolutely
[09:57:21] <arschmitz> i think those are all completely valid points
[09:57:48] <scottjehl__> we often move heavier options into an external extension, which is a good pattern, but I think a lot of our performance issues are from inline, non-optional logic that isn't necessarily directed at the use case at-hand
[09:58:04] <johnbender> scottjehl__: full agree
[09:58:16] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: i agree as well
[09:58:19] <johnbender> hence the "feature autoturret"
[09:59:02] <arschmitz> i think the one difference with something like destroy is its publicly documented as existing on all widgets by UI and we use the widget factory
[09:59:04] <scottjehl__> it's a classic framework problem. extensions help. Some code is non-optional to include, though. In this case, destroy is a widget method that we should extend by default, even if most people never use it
[09:59:32] <arschmitz> sounds like in general we are in agreement i think then
[10:00:06] <scottjehl__> there are others though. I'm not proposing a removal of destroy, just a general eye on how our typical path is hindered by optional situations
[10:01:07] <arschmitz> scottjehl__: i completely agree thats why the fixedtoolbar workaround crap went into an extension
[10:01:12] <johnbender> scottjehl__: I think we've gotten a lot better at starting with something minimal
[10:01:18] <arschmitz> it should be 100% optional
[10:01:19] <johnbender> and evaluating whether the communit requests are valid
[10:01:40] <johnbender> we can assume features are necessary on behalf of the user
[10:01:42] <johnbender> *can't
[10:02:09] <arschmitz> johnbender: scottjehl__: i also think this is where we are going to be making a lot more demos
[10:02:43] <arschmitz> and why if we make things easily extended its easy to say well right an extension and then it will do that
[10:03:35] <arschmitz> really allows us to cut down on whats in the library but allow it to be done if people want it and with demos  show them how
[10:04:30] <arschmitz> johnbender: i like "feature autoturret" lol
[10:04:31] <scottjehl__> yeah I'm a big fan of making many options external extensions

[10:41:55] <scottjehl__> cool, agreed
[10:42:27] <scottjehl__> this is less about "bloat" from a LOC perspective, and more about "every dom action potentially causes a ripple in performance"

[11:19:28] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: actually
[11:19:31] <johnbender> one sec
[11:19:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, let's make sure that's not the value being used :)
[11:20:02] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's not being used in history
[11:20:06] <johnbender> so I should actually take it out of there
[11:20:14] <johnbender> if nav puts it on there
[11:20:17] <johnbender> then it is what it is
[11:20:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: so I would take it out of the history constructor and leave it in the other part of nav
[11:20:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. That's cool ...
[11:21:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, will you yank it then?
[11:21:35] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah

[12:15:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[12:16:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[12:16:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: check this out http://jsbin.com/uzaret/606/edit
[12:16:57] <arschmitz> you cant make buttons that are inputs into a controlgroup
[12:17:12] <uGoMobi> hmm
[12:17:32] <uGoMobi> labels are supposed to be hidden
[12:18:02] <arschmitz> oh yeah then it would work but you would lose text
[12:18:23] <arschmitz> but i guess that makes sense the text should be the value
[12:18:34] <uGoMobi> yeah that's why recommend to add a legend
[12:18:44] <uGoMobi> why we*
[12:19:22] <arschmitz> yeah i think whats there should still work though
[12:19:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah I was going to take a look at that this afternoon
[12:19:48] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: don't worry abotu it
[12:19:54] <johnbender> arschmitz: about to head to the gym
[12:20:06] <arschmitz> johnbender: ok
[12:26:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: those are buttons, not checkboxes so the label text should just be hidden
[12:26:20] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looking into it
[12:27:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i know the check is just what i named them lol and yes thats what i was saying is they should be hidden that the jsbin as is should work 
[12:29:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we do this with CSS
[12:29:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but only for the selects
[12:30:09] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks like we didn't think of buttons and input type button
[12:30:30] <arschmitz> buttons are fine they dont have a label its built in essentially lol
[12:31:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: buttons are form element so you could give them a label right?
[12:31:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not sure i didnt think they got a label because they have text of their own that acts as a label

[12:33:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I invented the class ui-submit once to style these label/inputs in fieldcontain
[12:33:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we can use that class to hide the label just like we do for the select
[12:33:56] <arschmitz> cool

[12:34:57] <uGoMobi> i agree it might not make much sense but i think it is valid markup

[14:13:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: regarding performance I mean
[14:14:27] <uGoMobi> or is it the same, but written in another way?

[14:37:35] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I think you are right
[14:45:22] <kinblas> toddparker: johnbender: is jqm still using vlick in places? I just ran across a bug in mobile safari you should be aware of
[14:45:30] <kinblas> vclick not vlick :-)
[14:47:00] <toddmparker> kinblas: yes, we are but very limited
[14:47:10] <toddmparker> what's the bug?
[14:47:21] <toddmparker> also, hi!
[14:47:21] <kinblas> toddmparker: ok … the bug is that if you throw an alert/prompt from a touchend event
[14:47:54] <kinblas> the dismissal of that dialog will trigger a touchstart event targeted at the target of that touchend event
[14:48:05] <kinblas> that is clicking the ok button of the alert
[14:48:15] <kinblas> fires a touchstart at the original element that was touched
[14:48:25] <kinblas> even if it is no where near the alert
[14:48:41] <kinblas> … no corresponding touchend is dispatched after your finger goes up
[14:48:43] <toddmparker> ugh. not good.
[14:48:46] <kinblas> but the next time you touch the screen
[14:48:52] <kinblas> the touchend gets flushed

[14:48:56] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06slide-panel-refactor 14292b1f8 15Scott Jehl: added a workaround to prevent conflicts with fixedtoolbars - the css workaround is in the fixedtoolbar css
[14:48:58] <kinblas> and again targeted at the element
[14:49:01] <toddmparker> so do you end up in a death loop?
[14:49:27] <kinblas> toddmparker: no basically it just fires any touchend handlers for that event you touched previously
[14:49:33] <kinblas> the next time you touch the screen
[14:49:43] <kinblas> I mention vclick because we fire vclick on touchend
[14:49:59] <kinblas> so a 2nd vclick will fire next time you touch the screen after dismissing the alert
[14:50:12] <kinblas> … it's a mobile safari bug
[14:50:22] <uGoMobi> kinblas: that could be the cause of this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4686
[14:50:23] <kinblas> but it makes it look like we're the ones double triggering
[14:51:19] <kinblas> uGoMobi:  Yup that's it
[14:51:38] <johnbender> kinblas: lolol corner cases yay!
[14:52:01] <kinblas> uGoMobi: so I guess I'm confirming the problem ;-)
[14:52:13] <kinblas> don't throw modal alerts/prompts from a touch event!

[14:54:35] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'm going to take a look at the jquery old build
[14:54:40] <uGoMobi> that I know them by hard
[14:54:44] <johnbender> I'm guessing it has something to do with the query params
[14:54:46] <johnbender> we'll see
[14:55:09] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:56:21] <uGoMobi> johnbender: BTW - could you make the 1.2-stable build test against core 1.8.3? we are now testing against 1.7.1/1.7.2/1.8.0 is I am not mistaken
[14:56:44] <uGoMobi> I suppose the 1.2.1 release will support core 1.8.3
[14:59:09] <johnbender> uGoMobi: and jquery-git
[14:59:12] <johnbender> but yes
[14:59:20] <johnbender> I'll do that
[14:59:24] <uGoMobi> johnbender: great
[14:59:40] <uGoMobi> and thanks

[15:05:29] <kinblas> uGoMobi: I have a basic test page if you want it :-)
[15:05:42] <kinblas> it just prints the events to the console

[15:57:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: I'll check it out tonight
[16:01:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think it has to do with the valuebg variable

[16:30:49] <uGoMobi> johnbender: np
[16:34:54] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what is the culprit?
[18:54:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im sure you gone now but its where i added the ability to set options dynamicly the class update takes place after the disabled check it should be before 
[18:54:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im pushing the fix right now
[19:27:20] <toddmparker_> anyone around?

[19:43:03] <toddmparker_> hey arschmitz!
[19:43:16] <toddmparker_> do you have any android devices handy?
[19:43:20] <toddmparker_> or old iOS?
[19:43:27] <arschmitz> i have a 2.3
[19:43:31] <arschmitz> and i have ios5
[19:44:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker: either of those helpful?

[19:45:55] <toddmparker_> 2.3 please
[19:46:15] <toddmparker_> mind checking the slide-panel-refactor branch?
[19:46:26] <toddmparker_> and seeing if the panels work on 2.3?
[19:46:27] <arschmitz> ok let me throw it on the charger lol
[19:46:39] <toddmparker_> heh. i know that feeling
[19:47:04] <toddmparker_> trying to dial in hardware acceleration. super tricky with that + fixed positioning
[19:47:18] <toddmparker_> think I have this in good shape for iOS 5 & 6
[19:47:28] <toddmparker_> my browserstack local tunnel isn't working
[19:48:50] <arschmitz> oh lame
[19:49:32] <arschmitz> there isnt a branch preview on that branch is there?
[19:52:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think the jquery znc is having trouble tonight
[19:52:54] <arschmitz> or my internet is being crazy
[19:54:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker: did you answer my question about a branch preview sorry irc issues
[19:54:01] <toddmparker_> branch preview won't be updated for a while
[19:54:10] <toddmparker_> no worries, i can test tomorrow!
[19:54:19] <toddmparker_> they update hourly
[19:54:31] <arschmitz> toddmparker not a problem i can clone to my server
[19:54:47] <arschmitz> i have a cool setup for pulling branches to my server
[19:55:03] <toddmparker_> noticed you got thing up on a server mighty fast arschmitz 
[19:55:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/
[19:56:06] <arschmitz> i keep all my branches in a folder this lists them all and links to the docs for each and shows test pages
[19:56:29] <arschmitz> if you click the right link it is a menu of all the tests and you can click them to run them for that branch
[19:57:22] <arschmitz> and for things im working on my local pc copy uploads to server on every save for easy previews on devices
[19:57:28] <toddmparker_> badass
[19:57:43] <arschmitz> makes testing and fixing really easy
[19:58:26] <toddmparker_> i bet
[19:58:46] <toddmparker_>  i was going to push up a copy but i'd have to dust off my ftp info
[19:59:51] <arschmitz> lol
[20:00:05] <arschmitz> its live on my server on that menu now and im checking on android
[20:01:03] <toddmparker_> cool. you have a url?
[20:01:26] <toddmparker_> this is the older version w/o hardware accel - http://jquerymobile.com/branches/slide-panel-refactor/docs/panels/index.html
[20:02:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: just got to http://uglymongrel.com/jqm
[20:02:36] <arschmitz> the branch will be in the list towards bottom
[20:02:39] <toddmparker_> cool
[20:03:33] <arschmitz> on reveal the panel is covered by header
[20:04:25] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[20:04:31] <toddmparker_> dangit android
[20:04:35] <arschmitz> toddmparker: also getting problems when i close the panel it closes and then reopens
[20:04:42] <toddmparker_> on 4.0, the panels are invisible
[20:04:49] <toddmparker_> hrm
[20:05:42] <arschmitz> hitting close again after makes it close but the main content pushes over then the panel hides
[20:06:33] <toddmparker_> things were ok until we added fixed headers back in
[20:06:58] <toddmparker_> thanks for testing!
[20:06:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker_ get bouncing panels when i use left then right panel
[20:07:10] <arschmitz> always android!
[20:07:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker: the close then open only seems to be after the first time the first time it works fine
[20:08:05] <toddmparker_> oh yeah, that is messed up
[20:08:20] <arschmitz> performance seems good though
[20:08:22] <toddmparker_> looking on browserstack 
[20:08:44] <toddmparker_> the issue is that iOS6 is really blinky, but 5 is ok
[20:08:58] <toddmparker_> so these changes might just need to be targeted at iOS6 or something
[20:09:53] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: i see yeah everything performance wise is good on all types on android 2.3.7 HTC thunderbolt 4g
[20:10:13] <toddmparker_> good to hear. man, this is tricky.
[20:10:23] <toddmparker_> we've spent days tinkering with this.
[20:10:43] <arschmitz> and the header covering the panel seems like its just not getting top paddingto deal with the header
[20:11:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker: its complicated dealing with so many platforms for sure
[20:12:08] <toddmparker_> trying to find a sweet spot but each is quirky in different ways.
[20:12:45] <arschmitz> toddmparker_:seems like they introduced a lot of new quirks in ios6
[20:13:48] <toddmparker_> they did. perf isn't so good without nudging it
[20:14:22] <arschmitz> its too bad ios5 over all wasent too bad if they could have just fixed some issues and left it alone lol
[20:16:58] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: got a new demo im going to put up soon
[20:17:12] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[20:17:15] <arschmitz> wrote a simple chained select widget last night for a client
[20:17:29] <toddmparker_> oh cool. that is a popular thing
[20:17:30] <arschmitz> just takes a json data source
[20:17:40] <toddmparker_> like a make > model kinda thing?
[20:17:47] <arschmitz> yup exactly
[20:18:03] <arschmitz> but it can also use inputs and other form controls to update the selects
[20:20:14] <toddmparker_> cool
[20:20:23] <toddmparker_> looking forward to checking it out!
[20:21:13] <arschmitz> yeah ill probably do it tomorrow just making sure it works solid
[20:23:22] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: for demos of widgets do you think the widget should be part of the view source?
[20:23:54] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: or just link to the github for that widget and show any additional code needed in the view source
[20:50:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: pushed the fix for disabled on slider and range. there is still one wierd problem with opacity on range was hoping you could take a look
[20:51:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: the highlight shows through the handle for some reason
