[06:57:21] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Cranking on triage
[06:57:42] <toddmparker> Been mentioning the nested list deprecation on twitter, got a few responses 
[06:58:35] <toddmparker> Thinking we should make an issue for 1.4 to remove this feature, lust a few reasons why and link to the issue/demo for nested collapsible lists 
[06:58:55] <toddmparker> We can handle feedback on that issue, if any
[07:01:57] <toddmparker> You might see activity from Victor Tsaran  here in irc and in the tracker . He us a blind user interested in helping us improve the accessibility of jQuery Mobile. Welcome Victor!
[07:15:22] <agcolom> hey toddmparker ! 
[07:30:27] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[07:31:33] <uGoMobi> welcome Victor!
[07:39:59] <toddmparker> Hi agcolom and uGoMobi 
[07:40:21] <toddmparker> How goes?
[07:41:21] <toddmparker> A but worried that we wont get the demo server stuff square
[07:41:22] <agcolom> good! My boiler is fixed! 
[07:42:26] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/tjDkZQ
[07:42:26] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14a72661f 15Jasper de Groot: Demos: Use include for the widget reference menu so we only have to update one file.
[07:43:56] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah I share you worries about the demos build and server stuff
[07:44:23] <uGoMobi> tried to get the build working in branch new-demos but didn't succeed yet
[07:44:32] <toddmparker> One option...
[07:44:36] <uGoMobi> think I need help from the other guys with that
[07:44:59] <toddmparker> Just move the demos into the docs folder
[07:45:16] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes that crossed my mind too
[07:45:29] <toddmparker> Least we know it would work 
[07:45:57] <toddmparker> We can decide tomorrow 
[07:46:28] <toddmparker> I'm just not sure of all the elements that need to align to have the folder names change
[07:46:45] <uGoMobi> neither am I 
[07:47:17] <uGoMobi> I just search for things that seem related but without really understanding the whole process
[07:47:54] <uGoMobi> what I can do is create a branch local and move contents of demos folder into docs folder
[07:48:09] <uGoMobi> so I can test local if the build works
[07:50:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: BTW - now use an include for the menus it would be easy create an autocomplete search for the docs
[07:51:18] <uGoMobi> with the section (widget/demos/etc) as autodivider
[07:52:13] <uGoMobi> pages like accordion can get filter text "collapsible set, accordion"
[07:52:45] <toddmparker> Awesome idea
[07:52:54] <uGoMobi> we could also include FAQ pages
[07:53:00] <toddmparker> So we search all the h2s?
[07:53:03] <uGoMobi> if we set autodivider text there
[07:53:51] <uGoMobi> oh that would be possible too... add the h2's to the filter text
[07:54:33] <toddmparker> So you're proposing that we do what I have for the "search" currently in the docs
[07:54:52] <uGoMobi> basically the same yeah
[07:54:54] <toddmparker> I hand edited the keywords per item
[07:55:09] <uGoMobi> but now we only use it for widgets right
[07:55:10] <uGoMobi> ?
[07:55:27] <uGoMobi> in the nav panel search
[07:55:31] <toddmparker> Maybe we can make a grunt task that somehow generates this 
[07:56:18] <toddmparker> But for now, I agree that we can fortify the nav with some aliases/keywords
[07:56:34] <toddmparker> Manually 
[07:56:50] <uGoMobi> the idea is that when you search for "panel" for example.. you will get links to both the panel widget page as panel demo page
[07:57:06] <uGoMobi> and even FAQ pages
[07:57:45] <toddmparker> Oh I see
[07:57:55] <uGoMobi> and we use autodivider selector to divide the results
[07:57:59] <toddmparker> But would this be a second search box
[07:58:20] <toddmparker> Or are we keying off the widget filter
[07:58:47] <toddmparker> And somehow having demo and FAQ items hidden until you search?
[07:58:48] <uGoMobi> what we can do it in the nav panel
[07:58:56] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:59:06] <toddmparker> The latter?
[07:59:27] <toddmparker> So the filter somehow searches across all 3 lists?
[07:59:36] <uGoMobi> right
[07:59:46] <uGoMobi> in the nav panel if we like
[08:00:07] <uGoMobi> but have to think how we can use filter reveal but not hide the widget reference items
[08:00:12] <uGoMobi> only the others
[08:00:18] <toddmparker> Or we could add the search button back in on the right
[08:01:21] <uGoMobi> if we want to change the header anyway we could put a search field in it
[08:01:22] <toddmparker> If we did that, maybe we could use Ajax to concat the 3 lists
[08:01:37] <uGoMobi> or like you said... link to search
[08:02:08] <uGoMobi> we can use the PHP include
[08:02:14] <toddmparker> Right
[08:02:31] <toddmparker> There a way to sort alpha in lists
[08:02:34] <uGoMobi> I just changed widget reference already... there is now only one file that contains the menu
[08:02:40] <uGoMobi> the others include
[08:02:42] <toddmparker> If we combined, then sorted 
[08:02:55] <toddmparker> Then filter it
[08:03:03] <uGoMobi> yes we can sort the list
[08:03:15] <toddmparker> There a demo for that?
[08:03:19] <toddmparker> Not built in
[08:03:22] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:03:32] <toddmparker> Good future feature
[08:04:05] <toddmparker> If the widget list filter isn't super useful, we could have a search at the top of the panel 
[08:04:30] <uGoMobi> yeah, only thing is the width
[08:04:31] <toddmparker> Or we keep it and have a search button upper right that opens a search field 
[08:04:39] <uGoMobi> if we include FAQ pages in the results
[08:04:46] <uGoMobi> bit longer title
[08:04:55] <toddmparker> Right, need to allow wrapping
[08:05:00] <toddmparker> Smaller type?
[08:05:20] <toddmparker> This would be awesome tho
[08:05:38] <uGoMobi> yeah always wanted a good search tool for the docs
[08:05:43] <toddmparker> Right
[08:05:53] <toddmparker> Me too
[08:06:11] <uGoMobi> and we have all the tools now
[08:06:23] <toddmparker> The idea of just re-using these 3 lists and fortifying some with extra keywords is elegant
[08:06:34] <toddmparker> Good demo material too
[08:06:46] <toddmparker> Show off how to finesse things 
[08:07:05] <toddmparker> I think I like the idea of a separate search on the right
[08:07:09] <uGoMobi> yes, it combines several features
[08:07:32] <toddmparker> At wider widths it can be visible, narrow = tap to show a search bar
[08:07:34] <uGoMobi> ok I put it together and add search field at the right top
[08:07:39] <uGoMobi> then we can always move it
[08:07:41] <toddmparker> Yeah? Awesome 
[08:08:07] <toddmparker> Makes me want to use the logo in the middle, linked to home
[08:08:17] <uGoMobi> yeah we can expand the search field animated
[08:08:22] <toddmparker> Cool
[08:08:37] <toddmparker> I'll do a sketch later
[08:08:51] <toddmparker> Maybe a white top bar with the logo would be nice
[08:09:04] <uGoMobi> maybe put the version in there
[08:09:09] <uGoMobi> instead of footer
[08:09:09] <toddmparker> Either that or charcoal
[08:09:16] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[08:09:21] <toddmparker> Logo doesn't work on green
[08:09:28] <uGoMobi> true
[08:09:35] <toddmparker> Yeah, good call on version
[08:09:51] <toddmparker> Ok, I'll do a mockup while you hack on this
[08:10:11] <uGoMobi> great

[08:29:29] <agcolom> nice! 
[08:35:01] <agcolom> uGoMobi: should I link to the demo site at a different address? 
[08:36:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: do you mean view.jquerymobile.com vs. jquerymobile.com/test/ ?
[08:36:30] <agcolom> yes
[08:37:08] <uGoMobi> view.jquerymobile.com doesn't work yet
[08:37:33] <uGoMobi> so until then we should use /test/
[08:39:17] <agcolom> ok, so I'll link to test instead then
[08:40:23] <agcolom> I'll do a tag this evening or tomorrow... 
[08:42:08] <agcolom> What do you think about calling the demo site the Demo Center? (just for the link on the api docs)

[08:44:08] <uGoMobi> agcolom: maybe demo showcase
[08:44:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: that's how we call it there
[08:44:45] <agcolom> ok... 
[08:44:51] <uGoMobi> although it's not only demos actually, big part is widget reference pages
[08:45:11] <uGoMobi> but of course many demos will be added from now on :)
[08:45:20] <agcolom> Let's double check with toddmparker when he gets back then :)
[08:45:28] <uGoMobi> sure
[08:46:26] <agcolom> uGoMobi: 1.3.0 final will work with 1.9.0 or 1.9.1 ? (as recommended and documented?)
[08:46:38] <agcolom> (just to get the CDNs ready in hte api docs)
[08:47:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: 1.9.1
[08:47:27] <agcolom> perfect! Thank you :-)
[08:47:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't know about 2.0
[08:48:40] <uGoMobi> not sure when that will be released but I think I remember toddmparker saying we were going to support that as well
[08:49:11] <uGoMobi> reminds me we didn't update master to 1.9.1 yet
[08:49:42] <agcolom> yes, that's why I was asking, because I didn't see that updated... 
[08:50:02] <agcolom> so I thought we were recommendign 1.9.0 for now.
[08:50:04] <uGoMobi> but we always support latest point release
[08:50:23] <uGoMobi> 1.9.1 vs. 1.9.0 is only bug fixes
[08:50:40] <uGoMobi> so we should support 1.9.1
[08:50:59] <uGoMobi> but please double check with toddmparker when he is back from the farmers :)
[08:52:00] <agcolom> yes toddmparker said 1.9.1 in the issue tracker
[08:53:00] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[08:53:10] <uGoMobi> 1.9.1 is fine then
[08:53:15] <uGoMobi> think 2.0 is too soon
[08:54:10] <uGoMobi> bit of a special case anyway because 2.0 won't support old IE
[09:00:49] <agcolom> yes..
[09:08:50] <agcolom> btw, I'm after a page or a picture with form elements in a fieldcontainer showing the difference between portrait and landscape
[09:09:08] <agcolom> I'm convinced we have this somewhere but I can't find it again!
[09:09:39] <agcolom> I can't remember if it's in the docs or in a blog post... I've looked everywhere... 
[09:10:07] <agcolom> Do you remember seeing this?
[09:10:44] <agcolom> Forget it, I've just remembered... it's in my lecture notes! 
[09:10:49] <agcolom> Sorry ;-)
[09:25:50] <uGoMobi> no worries... didn't see your question yet ;-) glad you found it
[11:14:25] <vick08>  
[11:48:31] <vick08> Hi, is there anybody who understands ARIA? I wanted to throw in a couple of ideas around.
[11:49:25] <toddmparker___> agreed - we should say we support 1.9.1 and use that for our cdn references in demos
[11:49:33] <vick08> This is re accessibility.
[11:49:45] <toddmparker___> hi vick08 
[11:50:09] <toddmparker___> i know aria but not enough to have an intelligent conversation
[11:51:48] <toddmparker___> agcolom: for the demo url for 1.3, don't use test since that's master
[11:52:24] <toddmparker___> use jquerymobile.com/demos/1.3.0 if you want to point to locked versions of pages
[11:52:45] <toddmparker___> we generally shouldn't every link to latest in docs since it's not teied to a release and can break
[11:53:20] <toddmparker___> when the view site works, we'll redirect that url to view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0 so the links won't break
[11:53:29] <toddmparker___> seems like for 1.3, we're going to use the same urls are before
[12:29:13] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: idea for a lighter top - http://i.imgur.com/RJf99cc.png
[12:29:45] * uGoMobi is looking
[12:30:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: yeah I like that style
[12:30:27] <uGoMobi> want to use custom icons?
[12:30:32] <uGoMobi> bigger ones
[12:31:09] <agcolom> toddmparker___: ok
[12:31:50] <agcolom> toddmparker___: Also, i think we need to update the donate page (i think we've received Windows phones ?)
[12:31:52] <toddmparker___> maybe
[12:31:58] <toddmparker___> agcolom: right
[12:32:01] <toddmparker___> and bb10
[12:32:08] <agcolom> oh yes
[12:32:21] <toddmparker___> just and idea uGoMobi 
[12:32:26] <toddmparker___> we can use standard ones too
[12:32:38] <toddmparker___> but it would be ok to use custom i think
[12:32:39] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: not sure about version so close to logo.... bit crowdy in the middle
[12:32:46] <toddmparker___> nice to show that things can look non-stock
[12:32:51] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: agreed
[12:32:52] <uGoMobi> our ones are a bit small
[12:32:53] <toddmparker___> needs work
[12:33:00] <toddmparker___> we cna move that to the bottom
[12:33:05] <toddmparker___> ok, be back in a bit
[12:33:13] <uGoMobi> yeah I understand it's first pass
[12:48:28] <agcolom> toddmparker___: also how do we call the demos? As tentative, I've called it the jQuery Mobile Demo Center (in ref to the Learning Center) but I'm not sure what we should call it. Have you got a name in mind?
[13:01:14] <toddmparker> agcolom: That sounds ok to me
[13:03:10] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Another idea would be to have the logo left with bars after then search 
[13:03:36] <toddmparker> Want this to look less line an iOS app
[13:03:44] <toddmparker> Any ideas welcome
[13:04:01] <toddmparker> Top can be taller at wider breakpoints
[13:04:15] <uGoMobi> I agree with own style
[13:10:52] <toddmparker> +1
[13:13:41] <uGoMobi> almost finished with autocomplete search
[13:14:03] <uGoMobi> then I wil look at the header
[13:14:40] <uGoMobi> one issue with the search... we don't support filter reveal + autodividers
[13:15:06] <uGoMobi> you see all dividers and the other list items are hidden
[13:15:17] <uGoMobi> so have to look at a hack for that
[13:28:09] <toddmparker> Ah
[13:28:29] <toddmparker> We can just hide dividers
[13:28:47] <toddmparker> Not really needed
[13:29:50] <toddmparker> Seems like we should handle that somehow
[13:33:02] <uGoMobi> I hide them now
[13:33:37] <uGoMobi> but my idea was to divide the results in 3 sections... widgets demos faq
[13:36:09] <toddmparker> Ah, gotcha
[13:36:41] <toddmparker> Those would need to be generated anyway right?
[13:37:14] <uGoMobi> I use autodividersSelector
[13:37:27] <toddmparker> Gotcha, smart
[13:37:30] <uGoMobi> and set data- attribute

[14:10:42] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi and agcolom - posting a few minor variations for the header
[14:11:20] <toddmparker___> http://i.imgur.com/RMwkVbd.png
[14:12:27] <agcolom> I like the 1st one best I think
[14:12:37] <toddmparker___> we can play around in code with this, just showing how the balance shifts if we align left or increase the top or have a search box open
[14:13:07] <agcolom> but then the search box being present directly might be good too... 
[14:13:08] <toddmparker___> the left one can also have the logo centered with no version
[14:13:22] <toddmparker___> yeah, if uGoMobi pulls this off, might be really powerful
[14:13:51] <agcolom> toddmparker___: on the left one, what happens when we choose the 'search'?
[14:14:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I like the first one too
[14:14:50] <uGoMobi> we can open the search bar below the header
[14:14:53] <toddmparker___> this layout is 420px not 320 so it will be tighter
[14:14:58] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: sure can
[14:26:15] <toddmparker___> how about this agcolom and uGoMobi

[14:26:33] <toddmparker___> ^^ new design withe search bar
[14:26:36] <toddmparker___> brb
[14:27:03] <uGoMobi> I like the this concept
[14:27:10] <uGoMobi> with search bar
[14:29:17] <uGoMobi> I just parked the search field at the right top for now
[14:29:33] <uGoMobi> no animation or anything yet
[14:33:36] <toddmparker___> cool
[14:34:25] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: wow, that works great!
[14:34:29] <toddmparker___> love it
[14:34:35] <toddmparker___> i'll use it constantly
[14:34:53] <toddmparker___> think we should have a search box at wider screen sizes for sure for easy access
[14:35:04] <uGoMobi> thanks
[14:35:10] <uGoMobi> yeah it needs some space
[14:35:19] <uGoMobi> certainly with faq list items
[14:36:59] <uGoMobi> do you like the idea of a divider (assuming we can get that to work) or just sort alphabetically?
[14:40:42] <toddmparker> Seems clear now w/o a divider
[14:40:55] <toddmparker> Definitely a less important thing

[14:42:12] <uGoMobi> that's the only way you can see it

[20:53:28] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14585d4a6 15toddparker: Demos: adjusted logo sizes, changed to reveal display for panel, set min-width of search autocomplete
[20:53:44] <toddmparker___> i did some work tonight
[20:54:11] <toddmparker___> see if you like the reveal better. was having trouble making overlay look good
[20:54:40] <toddmparker___> for search, it would be good to autofocus into the input when it opens
[20:55:13] <toddmparker___> be really great if you could navigate results via keyboard (up/down arrows + enter). also make for a good demo :)
[20:56:15] <toddmparker___> header needs more work at wider sizes. feels ok on a phone but not desktop
[20:56:37] <toddmparker___> think flipping the logo left and having the search open will help
[20:56:59] <toddmparker___> was going to link the logos to home but that might need to wait
[20:57:03] <toddmparker___> g'night!
[20:57:25] <joshuabud> Hey all
[20:57:50] <joshuabud> I'm just checking to see if rumors are correct that the 1.3.0 version will be release on or around Feb 18
[20:58:27] <joshuabud> We are about to launch a brand new app using JQM and Phonegap and want the very latest release. Especially the Panel part which is very cool BTW!
[21:00:05] <toddmparker___> joshuabud: yes, we're targeting monday for the final release
[21:00:31] <toddmparker___> app sounds cool
[21:00:36] <joshuabud> You guys are AWESOME!
[21:00:42] <toddmparker___> thanks!
[21:00:58] <joshuabud> We are hoping so. I'll share more info here when it's available, will be free.
[21:01:26] <joshuabud> Not the flashiest design implementation but theme roller helped out there :D
[21:03:24] <joshuabud> It's been a tough dev cycle and a long time coming. When we started it was originally 1.0.1 :|
[21:03:48] <joshuabud> It's crazy how fast things have come along with both JQM and Phonegap 
[21:08:22] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: if you close the search, we need to dismiss the autocomplete menu
[21:08:39] <toddmparker___> joshuabud: can't wait to see it
[21:08:42] <toddmparker___> mobile moves fast
[21:08:48] <toddmparker___> goodnight!
[21:10:08] <toddmparker___> reveal has a funny little goggle when you close it...hmm
[21:10:42] <toddmparker___> wonder if we should add in the swipe left (nav) and right (section) behavior

[21:13:58] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14bba5d6c 15toddparker: Demos: added a header to the panel
[21:19:49] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: i set a min-width on the search to keep it from collapsing but it's too wide on a phone by a little bit
[21:20:33] <toddmparker___> the search animation seems chunky so maybe we should use hide/show if we can't smooth it out? like the idea tho
[21:20:39] <toddmparker___> alright, not i'm out
