[06:06:50] <toddmparker> good morning
[06:07:17] <_|Nix|_> Hey!
[06:10:09] <uGoMobi> morning
[06:10:24] <toddmparker> hi uGoMobi
[06:10:35] <toddmparker> closing issues like a boss
[06:11:01] <toddmparker> just noticed a few typos in those table docs, but I think we're getting close there
[06:14:16] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: wondering your thoughts on including breakpoint presets for these via class
[06:15:06] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I was just about to reply on your mail
[06:15:19] <toddmparker> doing browser testing now on the table stuff…so far so good
[06:15:38] <uGoMobi> I am in favor it
[06:16:18] <toddmparker> i just think it will make life easier for common situations. If they don't work, you'll feel the need to write your own
[06:16:58] <toddmparker> still really emphasizing the "how it works" and "how to write MQs" so there is less magic and people can see how to take control
[06:17:49] <toddmparker> my kindle fire is charged up
[06:18:01] <uGoMobi> ok
[06:18:14] <toddmparker> browser is very blinky/slow so expect to see a lot of issues on that…close as "it's a crap device"
[06:18:36] <uGoMobi> about the MQ's.... we will run in the same issue with the new slide panel feature
[06:19:00] <uGoMobi> I think we should decide what approach we use in general, not just tables
[06:19:01] <toddmparker> we will
[06:19:19] <toddmparker> that is why i'm agonizing on how to do this. it's a precedent that will apply in a lot of places
[06:19:20] <uGoMobi> I think the opt-in with a class is best
[06:19:40] <toddmparker> right. it provides value without getting in the way of custom styles.
[06:19:51] <uGoMobi> maybe also put MQ css in a seperate file so you can exclude it with the download builder
[06:20:00] <toddmparker> if this seems good to folks, I can also add a class to stack grids
[06:20:23] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I was thinking about that. we should ask gseguin about how to do that
[06:20:33] <toddmparker> think the builder only surfaces js files
[06:21:03] <uGoMobi> I see
[06:22:01] <toddmparker> hrm. i see a bug. in android 4.0, the checkbox popup is acting odd. if I tap to uncheck, it unchecks then re-checks
[06:22:13] <uGoMobi> we could introduce a class like ui-responsive-a for min-width 30em and ui-responsive-b for min-width 48em
[06:22:33] <toddmparker> you just mean to use a more generic name?
[06:22:37] <uGoMobi> or ui-breakpoint
[06:22:42] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:22:43] <toddmparker> fine with that
[06:23:10] <toddmparker> i think we need to scope these breakpoints to widgets so that's why reflow and column toggle is int he name
[06:23:31] <uGoMobi> we should change the fieldcontain CSS in 1.3 to do the same
[06:23:34] <toddmparker> otherwise, i can see potential conflicts with loosely scoped styles
[06:24:16] <toddmparker> for fieldcontain, ask people to add a class to kick that MQ in? think that makes sense for consistency.
[06:24:45] <uGoMobi> yes for consistency, also change it from 450px to 30em
[06:27:18] <toddmparker> right. we need to use ems everywhere
[06:27:23] <toddmparker> good idea
[06:27:28] <toddmparker> mind making a ticket for that for 1.3
[06:27:40] <toddmparker> i'm working on a test page for that checkbox bug
[06:28:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: about the tables docs... maybe it helps if you integrate the section "Table plugin and extensions" in the first section
[06:28:42] <uGoMobi> to explain that there is a base + 2 extensions
[06:29:13] <uGoMobi> will make a ticket for the fieldcontain MQ's
[06:30:24] <toddmparker> interesting, that is not a bug with normal checkboxes
[06:30:37] <toddmparker> must be the timing of our refresh function on tables
[06:38:40] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: for tables you set a border color in the structure CSS
[06:39:08] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: yes, i need to figure that out
[06:39:17] <uGoMobi> I was looking at ui-br
[06:39:19] <toddmparker> might need to migrate that to a class
[06:39:32] <uGoMobi> that one we use for fieldcontain
[06:39:40] <toddmparker> yeah, if you add a theme class, the border is overridden
[06:39:54] <toddmparker> ui-br?
[06:40:00] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:40:20] <uGoMobi> but we set border-width for ui-br as well in theme css
[06:40:31] <uGoMobi> that should be moved to structure
[06:41:01] <toddmparker> yes it should
[06:41:07] <toddmparker> cleanup time!
[06:41:10] <uGoMobi> border-color can't be inherited
[06:41:39] <uGoMobi> would mean you have to add that class to all tables rows or cells :(
[06:41:54] <toddmparker> hrm
[06:42:27] <toddmparker> i was thinking i'd just add a class in table structure to apply the table strokes and note that those don't play nice with themes
[06:42:43] <uGoMobi> BTW IE 7/8 don't support rgba so for tables we should set a backup color first
[06:42:53] <toddmparker> good point
[06:42:59] <toddmparker> stupid ie
[06:43:14] <uGoMobi> that's also a good point :)
[06:45:28] <toddmparker> i'd rather use a class on a parent and set styles for children there rather than add a million classes (if we can)
[06:45:52] <uGoMobi> yes for sure
[07:08:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/CC3XFQ
[07:08:09] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/master a38792c Jasper de Groot: Theme CSS: changed class ui-br to only set border color and style. Border width is set in structure CSS (fieldcontain). Fixes #5277.
[07:29:05] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #838: FAILURE in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/838/
[07:48:43] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: turns out that "bug" in Android 4.0 was just crazy slow performance when the page was super long
[07:48:56] <toddmparker> breaking it up now
[07:51:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: but then I don't really understand why it checks and immediately unchecks it
[07:51:43] <uGoMobi> that was the problem, right?
[08:04:29] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: maybe you already saw it, but the </tbody> is missing in the tables general markup code example
[08:05:55] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i'll fix that
[08:06:12] <toddmparker> re: kindle fire hd, it just sucks with css. i closed that.
[08:10:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, I saw your comment. should we add that browser to the default blacklist?
[08:18:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: tables border color http://jsbin.com/omegup/2/edit
[08:19:12] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: we can change .ui-br {} into .ui-br, .ui-br td {} in the theme css
[08:20:10] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: i dunno. i feel like amazon will probably fix it up soon
[08:20:22] <toddmparker> might even be an odd thing with their proxy stuff
[08:20:24] <uGoMobi> ah ok, then we just leave it
[08:20:32] <toddmparker> yeah, rather call 'em out
[08:30:32] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: good call on merging the plugin stuff with the table intro

[11:56:47] <ryanneufeld> somehow I'm getting all the notifications on everything that happens with the jquery mobile github repo
[11:56:55] <ryanneufeld> is there a mailing list I was added to?
[12:11:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/nxDlaQ

[12:17:55] <toddmparker> if either of you have time to review...
[12:28:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I am looking into it
[12:32:04] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[12:32:05] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #839: FIXED in 20 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/839/
[12:35:18] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: great. guess if you wait long enough, someone will help out
[12:36:55] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yeah, but it looks like this PR will need a lot of tweaking before we can pull
[12:39:09] <toddmparker> yeah? too bad.
[12:40:56] <agcolom> gseguin: johnbender: scott_gonzalez: the event type for slider create is slidecreate. For slidestart and slidestop, is it slidestart and slidestop or slideslidestart and slideslidestop?
[12:44:07] <toddmparker> agcolom: are we inconsistent with the create event naming?
[12:44:56] <agcolom> create is always create. it's the type that picks up the widget name in some cases
[12:45:35] <agcolom> we didn't have the type in the old docs, but we need it in the api docs to be consistent with core and UI
[12:48:55] <uGoMobi> I remember johnbender toddmparker and I discussed the event names when John was working on the slider and we checked with UI
[12:50:13] <jqcommit> [api.jquerymobile.com] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/n7ab-A
[12:50:14] <jqcommit> api.jquerymobile.com/master cb1a26a Anne-Gaelle Colom: added slidestart and slidestop events to slider
[12:50:43] <uGoMobi> I think slidestart and slidestop are correct
[12:51:03] <agcolom> yes, they look correct
[12:51:20] <Wilto> Did the non-prefixed transition animation branch get nuked?
[12:51:40] <Wilto> IE10 is upon us. It is time.
[12:52:01] <uGoMobi> Wilto: there was no branch, I have that branch on my forked repo
[12:52:51] <Wilto> Oh, nice.
[12:53:31] <uGoMobi> Wilto: the problem was the 3D support and validStyle functions
[12:53:56] <uGoMobi> they weren't designed for unprefixed
[12:54:22] <Wilto> I shall redesign them, forthwith!
[12:55:13] <Wilto> I’m gonna pull it into a branch, if that’s cool.
[12:55:23] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I started with that but got sidetracked
[12:55:42] <toddmparker> be good to hack on that for 1.3
[12:56:00] <toddmparker> wilt is fired up so if uGoMobi cn hop get him up sed
[12:56:00] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes we have to add that for 1.3 for sure
[12:56:09] <Wilto> toddmparker: are you okay
[12:56:55] <uGoMobi> Wilto: yeah let's work this out in a branch
[12:57:00] <Wilto> Cool, cool.
[12:57:07] <toddmparker> i thimk im harvings astrokke
[12:58:01] <uGoMobi> Wilto: shall I'll create that branch
[12:58:21] <uGoMobi> I can paste the CSS changes and then push it
[12:58:28] <Wilto> Sounds good!
[12:58:37] <uGoMobi> will take me like 10 or 15 mins
[12:58:39] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:09:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi created unprefixed-transitions (+1 new commit): http://git.io/l-SpIA
[13:09:08] <jqmobilecommit> jquery-mobile/unprefixed-transitions 17ce0a7 Jasper de Groot: Added unprefixed properties to transitions CSS for IE10 support.
[13:09:20] <uGoMobi> Wilto: there it is ^
[13:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: The callback name is likely not slidestart, but slide.
[13:16:39] <scott_gonzalez> err...start
[13:17:07] <scott_gonzalez> confirmed: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/slider.js#L284
[13:17:58] <Wilto> Thanks, uGoMobi!
[13:18:02] <scott_gonzalez> Also, someone should rip this out and update the widget factory: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/slider.js#L480
[13:18:19] <scott_gonzalez> You'll want to use master, not 1.9.1.
[13:21:52] <uGoMobi> Wilto: np, thanks for looking into those two functions
[13:23:00] <uGoMobi> Wilto: also, there is an open ticket for this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4875 maybe you can close it with your commit
[13:24:10] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Should we use master because the fix was added after 1.9.1 was tagged?
[13:24:22] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:24:37] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and is it likely to change for the next release?
[13:24:38] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9.1 has a regression.
[13:24:44] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Aha, OK.
[13:26:33] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: What about the next UI release? Is the factory gonna go into it pretty much as it is?
[13:26:59] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[13:27:07] <_|Nix|_> OK. Grabbing it then.
[13:27:16] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Thanks for the heads-up!
[13:37:16] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Is $( ".selector" ).data( "widgetname" ) still available in this version?
[13:37:23] <scott_gonzalez> no
[13:37:30] <scott_gonzalez> .data( "ns-widgetname" )
[13:37:34] <johnbender> agcolom: when the event is triggered it should be "widgetprefixcreate"
[13:37:52] <scott_gonzalez> .data( "widgetname" ) was deprecated in 1.9.0.
[13:37:59] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Oy ... gotta look over the codebase then ...
[13:38:15] <scott_gonzalez> If you want, you can grab it from 1-9-stable and then clean up the .data() calls later.
[13:38:31] <johnbender> agcolom: we would have to manually support other events in the options passed to the widget method I believe
[13:38:32] <scott_gonzalez> 1-9-stable will have the regression fix but not the .data( "widgetname" ) removal.
[13:38:34] <johnbender> which we don't
[13:38:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Right, but what about the widgetEventPrefix fix ... ?
[13:39:07] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Anything that goes through _trigger() is automatically an option.
[13:39:20] <johnbender> agcolom: sans the prefix?
[13:39:26] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:39:37] <johnbender> agcolom: also the prefix is manually altered with the slider to be "slide" to follow the UI projects convention
[13:39:58] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I think I'll go through the codebase and just update our uses of .data( "widgetname" ) ...
[13:39:59] <johnbender> agcolom: so the using on it would be on("slidestart")
[13:40:11] <johnbender> s/the//
[13:40:20] <johnbender> creating the widget it would be
[13:40:31] <johnbender> slider({ start: function(){} });
[13:40:43] <johnbender> foo.on( "slidestart", function(){});
[13:40:48] <johnbender> those are the two options
[13:54:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, you can actually hook up event handlers during instantiation? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.ui.widget.js#L155 seems to imply that the parameter to .widgetname() is an object containing options, not event handlers.
[13:57:02] <agcolom> johnbender: perfect! Thanks!
[13:57:44] <agcolom> johnbender: do you mean start or create?
[14:00:30] <johnbender> agcolom: it works with either according to scott_gonzalez
[14:00:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yep, according to scott_gonzalez it uses the option when _trigger is used
[14:01:45] <agcolom> So on this page, we have slidestart and slidestop: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/slider/events.html
[14:02:35] <agcolom> does this mean we could use the widget name instead of on, and use start instead of slidestart?
[14:03:26] <agcolom> with start: function(){}  instead of "slidestart", function(){} ?
[14:03:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, so, I don't get it. How do you distinguish between shadow and start?
[14:04:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it's the responsibility of the widget author to prevent events from coliding with options
[14:04:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Is it the value type of the parameter? i.e., if $.type( options.shadow ) === "function"  { /* hook up event handler */ }
[14:04:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's dandy, because we have function-valued options.
[14:05:11] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: only if you _trigger("shadow")
[14:05:17] <agcolom> johnbender: OMG it works!!!!
[14:05:25] <johnbender> agcolom: lolol
[14:05:33] <johnbender> agcolom: thank scott_gonzalez
[14:05:42] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: again this is my understanding based on the last 20 minutes
[14:09:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. I looked at the code for _trigger and, indeed, it mixes options and event handlers - if the widget implementer so chooses.
[14:09:21] <johnbender> yep
[14:11:42] <agcolom>  johnbender ok, this is now the sample code, showing both ways of attaching something to the events: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/492/edit
[14:12:06] <agcolom> however, I can't get it to work with the ',' it seems to only work with ':'
[14:12:21] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: is this normal? ^
[14:13:16] <agcolom> (maybe I've done something wrong... I'm not an expert with these things... but if I can be clear about them, the docs will be correct ;-) )
[14:14:00] <agcolom> and I now understand the point of the prefix!
[14:25:00] <johnbender> agcolom: for the slider() method?
[14:25:08] <agcolom> yes
[14:25:09] <johnbender> it has to be part of an object passed as a param
[14:25:18] <johnbender> slider( { event: function })
[14:25:57] <agcolom> i've tried to attach something here to start and stop: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/492/edit
[14:26:19] <agcolom> using 2 different ways (one with on, one with slider)
[14:26:45] <agcolom> so that works...
[14:27:24] <agcolom> but I thought sliderstop should be followed by a comma not a colon, but if I replace the colon by the comma, it doesn't work...
[14:28:20] <agcolom> (sorry I hope what I'm saying makes sense! maybe I'm totally not getting something!)
[14:28:51] <agcolom> oh, those brackets shouldn't be there then....
[14:29:29] <agcolom> johnbender: yes!!!!!
[14:29:44] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/495/edit
[14:30:10] <agcolom> Thank you thank you thank you!!!!!
[14:30:28] <agcolom> johnbender and scott_gonzalez ^^^^^
[14:30:42] <johnbender> np
[14:31:42] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi ^^^^ you may find this useful ^^^^
[14:32:32] <agcolom> now I deserve to go to bed... will write all that stuff tomorrow ;-)
[14:33:15] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, didn't know this was possible
[14:33:20] <uGoMobi> cool
[14:33:55] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: so I don't need to add the code examples for widget events, we'll get all that done automatically using the XSLT file, right? (Then we're sure it'll all be consistent)
[14:34:08] <agcolom> uGoMobi: yes, I am SO HAPPY!
[14:34:47] <uGoMobi> :D
[14:35:42] <agcolom> Goodnight.... catch you all tomorrow...
[14:35:51] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[14:36:02] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper
[14:40:26] <scott_gonzalez> _|Nix|_: It's not a choice of the widget implementor. All events MUST have a callback.
[14:42:06] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Correct, the examples should be auto-generated via XSLT.
[14:49:46] <Wilto> Submitted without comment:
[14:50:09] <Wilto> `console.log( window )` will output, in the IE10 console, a string reading “[object Window]”.
[14:51:00] <Wilto> So if anyone needs to confirm that the object “window” is in fact the window object: IE10 completely has your back.
[14:52:23] <Wilto> Again, I say this without comment.
[14:52:27] <Wilto> That is simply what it does.
[14:52:51] <Wilto> Anyway, I’m gonna go have a cry. Good talk.
[15:07:59] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: Pure awesomeness: https://github.com/pahen/node-madge
[15:09:07] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Cool!
[15:09:14] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Doesn't track css though ...
[15:09:26] <gseguin> it's open source :P
