[09:43:00] <gseguin> Thank you kinblas!
[09:46:53] <gseguin> kinblas: Could you close issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1654 as fixed
[09:47:13] <gseguin> and https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1704 as duplicate of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1595
[09:54:34] <toddparker> gseguin - i can do this for you
[09:54:44] <toddparker> is #1654 closed. i see your pull, but is it in?
[09:56:06] <toddparker> closed #1704 for you
[09:56:33] <toddparker> scott was cranking last night. went thru a bunch of pull requests and fixed bugs
[10:05:12] <gseguin> toddparker: kinblas just landed my pull for 1654
[10:06:26] <gseguin> I saw that (scott cranking last night), he landed another one of my pull request
[10:20:17] <toddparker> cool
[10:31:29] <gseguin> toddparker: so can you close #1654 for me?
[10:54:11] <toddparker> gseguin -ok closed
[10:54:14] <toddparker> was that pulled in?
[10:54:28] <gseguin> yes by kinblas  this morning
[10:54:53] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1662
[10:55:24] <toddparker> cool, just checking
[10:56:00] <toddparker> so let's all try to land whatever we can today and over the weekend so on monday, we're ready to push out beta
[10:56:16] <toddparker> it always takes a long time to get out, even w/o code tweaks
[10:56:22] <gseguin> I just updated https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1660
[10:56:31] <gseguin> can someone review and land?
[10:57:38] <gseguin> toddparker: yeah I'm trying to get my issues closed, especially the one that have a pending pull request for them
[11:14:54] <kinblas> gseguin: I just cc'd you on a build failure
[11:15:08] <kinblas> might be spurious but thought we should at least check it out
[11:24:12] <gseguin> kinblas: that's weird
[11:26:26] <gseguin> checking right now
[11:28:06] <gseguin> ok it does fail
[11:28:21] <gseguin> but only the first time it runs
[11:28:32] <gseguin> if I re-run it it passes
[11:31:46] <gseguin> kinblas: I think it's just because of the way I wrote the test
[12:01:25] <gseguin> kinblas, toddparker: pull request https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1845 should take care of the test failing test -> asyncTest
[12:09:42] <toddparker> Thanks gseguin!
[12:10:52] <toddparker> Next time, you can do it yourself. I just set the wheels in motion for you to be a added as a mobile committer. Congratulations!
[12:11:03] <kinblas> w00t
[12:11:20] <kinblas> gseguin: and you can close bugs too :-P
[12:11:21] <toddparker> Looking forward to having your help!
[12:11:29] <toddparker> yeah!
[12:52:08] <gseguin> w00t!
[12:52:46] <gseguin> Thank you!
[12:53:26] <gseguin> Can I get added to the build notifications, so I can catch that kind of problems early on
[12:54:45] <toddparker> sure. just need to ask _nickel
[12:55:04] <gseguin> alright, I'll try to catch him next time he's online
[12:55:37] <toddparker> cool
[13:11:09] <gseguin> toddparker: has work started on a branch for multipane views (for tablets)
[13:11:11] <gseguin> ?
[13:13:28] <toddparker> not really
[13:13:55] <toddparker> the momentum scroller needs to be worked on to support that
[13:14:20] <toddparker> but there are still the larger questions about how to represent an aggregate page, deal with hash changes, etc
[13:17:16] <gseguin> ok
[13:18:19] <gseguin> I want to make sure that I catch that tablet train
[13:47:11] <toddparker> heh
[13:47:24] <toddparker> i just tagged a few issues for you
[13:47:37] <toddparker> in general, it woudl be nice to try and optimize our screen real estate a bit
[13:47:43] <toddparker>  we truncate too much
[13:47:57] <toddparker> and don't take advantage of all the pixels we have
[13:48:00] <gseguin> is that me?
[13:48:03] <toddparker> yep
[13:48:06] <gseguin> oh ok
[13:48:23] <toddparker> there are a lot fo times where we wrap or tuncate when it *could* fit
[13:48:28] <toddparker> just need to tweak our styles
[13:49:02] <gseguin> ok will look into it
[14:29:16] <toddparker> kinblas and I are hunting down this BB5 issue now: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1846
[14:29:23] <toddparker> regression on the 13th killing BB5
