[08:21:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> bob: fixed typos and added @deprecated note to the $.mobile.addResolutionBreakpoints method
[08:42:21] <gseguin> morning all
[08:46:44] <gseguin> toddparker: ping
[09:11:55] <_nickel> scottjehl: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2514
[09:11:56] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2514 on jquery-mobile, reported by itechnology (2d, 23h ago): JQM with MVC 3 & Ajax.ActionLink broken
[09:12:03] <_nickel> having a hard time groking that one
[09:12:12] <_nickel> I'm assuming he's trying to update content via ajax
[09:12:20] <_nickel> so I'm wondering if the new hook will solve that problem
[09:14:37] <_nickel> scottjehl: nevermind that appears to be the way he's doing it
[09:19:35] <kinblas> _nickel: partial views replace content on the page
[09:19:56] <kinblas> _nickel: he's basically slamming content in and wondering how to get jqm to recognize enhance
[09:20:01] <kinblas> at least that's my take
[09:20:20] <_nickel> kinblas: I think the page is transitioning because the link still navigates
[09:20:40] <_nickel> I'm guessing his content is really simple and doesn't require enhancement
[09:20:43] <_nickel> but let me reread
[09:21:47] <_nickel> kinblas: "i see the partial content updating the zone i specified in UpdateTargetId, however a split second later JQM navigates away from the page.
[09:21:50] <_nickel> "
[09:21:52] <kinblas> yeah I glossed over that part
[09:22:19] <_nickel> we'll see what he posts :D
[09:23:57] <kinblas> _nickel: so maybe we need a hook so folks can scan the link clicked and decide if we should handle it or they will handle it
[09:24:44] <_nickel> kinblas: can't they just bind and return false;?
[09:24:53] <_nickel> I suppose that stomps on any other handler as well
[09:25:20] <kinblas> _nickel: well what I'm wondering is if they added [data-preventdefault=true] to their link
[09:25:29] <kinblas> why didn't they just add data-rel="external"
[09:25:36] <kinblas> or data-ajax="false"
[09:25:48] <kinblas> those are the triggers that tell us not to do anything
[09:26:06] <kinblas> I can ask
[09:26:08] <_nickel> he may not know about them
[10:29:37] <kinblas> gseguin: just an fyi - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2529
[10:29:38] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2529 on jquery-mobile, reported by gemehendrix (2h, 24m ago): Transition to the same page
[10:34:19] <gseguin> kinblas: yeah I saw that. Thanks
[10:35:36] <gseguin> We have disabled transitions for the time being but when now we could potentially re-enable after migrating to 1.0
[10:35:51] <gseguin> fantastic work kinblas!
[11:04:54] <kinblas> scottjehl: toddparker: do you have access to an iOS5 ipad/iphone/ipod?
[11:07:01] <toddparker> nice kinblas
[11:07:10] <toddparker> i have an ios5 iphone4
[11:07:24] <toddparker> gseguin has a ipad2 running ios5
[11:07:26] <TehShrike|Work> I have an iOS5 iPad 2
[11:07:39] <kinblas> toddparker: I just checked and they didn't close that bug (on the apple side) issue 785
[11:07:53] <kinblas> toddparker: can you try a sample for me?
[11:08:01] <toddparker> sure can
[11:08:44] <kinblas> toddparker: http://goo.gl/8QzeL
[11:08:48] <toddparker> can someone weigh in on this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2369#issuecomment-2190308
[11:08:48] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2369 on jquery-mobile, reported by charleskline (3w, 4d ago): .changePage() changes page, but reloads previous page into DOM
[11:08:55] <toddparker> kinblas: testing now
[11:09:08] <kinblas> toddparker: basically, place your caret at the end of what's in the textfield
[11:09:16] <kinblas> hit backspace, then type 'o' and 'm'
[11:09:22] <kinblas> hopefully it will suggest "automate"
[11:09:28] <kinblas> the bug is you can't dismiss the suggestion
[11:10:21] <toddparker> not showing a suggestion
[11:10:27] <toddparker> gseguin: you see that too?
[11:11:01] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, we need to get that suggestion popup to come up so we can verify
[11:11:05] <kinblas> that it is indeed fixed
[11:11:43] <kinblas> fixed for ios5 that is
[11:12:06] <kinblas> toddparker:  I can follow up on 2369
[11:13:00] <toddparker> yeha
[11:13:22] <toddparker> are you removing the attar on iOS5 or not writing it int eh first place?
[11:13:58] <kinblas> toddparker: that sample is jQuery Mobile free .. it is a basic test case that uses nothing but plain vanilla HTML
[11:14:58] <kinblas> toddparker: hmmm perhaps I should place the autocorrect attributes on there to force it?
[11:19:02] <kinblas> toddparker: hmmm that didn't work either
[11:19:27] <kinblas> toddparker: what beta of ios5 do you have loaded?
[11:19:48] * gseguin catches up
[11:21:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #73: SUCCESS in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/73/
[11:21:04] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jblas: Fix for issue 2529 - Transition to the same page
[11:21:20] <toddparker> lemme check kinblas
[11:21:59] <toddparker> i'm up-to-date on the beta
[11:22:03] <toddparker> think that's 6? 7?
[11:22:30] <gseguin> kinblas, toddparker: just checked and it seems to be fixed on iOS5b7
[11:22:42] <kinblas> gseguin: do you get a suggestion popup?
[11:22:54] <gseguin> not with "Aut"
[11:23:05] <kinblas> ??
[11:23:06] <gseguin> but with "Tur"
[11:23:09] <kinblas> oh
[11:23:12] * kinblas tries
[11:23:25] <kinblas> I can't get squat to show up
[11:23:39] <kinblas> lol
[11:23:46] <kinblas> I typed in 'squ"
[11:23:51] <kinblas> and it suggested squat
[11:23:53] <gseguin> Try "Automa"
[11:24:03] <kinblas> it looks like it is indeed fixed
[11:24:06] <kinblas> I can dismiss
[11:24:42] <kinblas> toddparker: ok, I feel better, I'll work on landing the check to disable the workaround
[11:24:48] <gseguin> kinblas: you have an iOS5 device?
[11:24:54] <kinblas> gseguin: i have an emulator
[11:24:59] <gseguin> oh ok
[11:25:19] <kinblas> gseguin: but I trust the device more
[11:25:20] <kinblas> :-
[11:25:21] <kinblas> :-)
[11:25:39] <kinblas> gseguin: so just to verify, you are able to tap the suggestion to dismiss it right?
[11:25:46] <gseguin> yep
[11:25:51] <kinblas> gseguin: ok thanks!
[11:25:55] <gseguin> np
[11:26:36] <gseguin> kinblas: you're going to Boston, right?
[11:27:03] <kinblas> gseguin: no, that's _nickel
[11:27:04] <_nickel> toddparker: is scottjehl around?
[11:27:16] <kinblas> gseguin: I'm holding the fort down
[11:27:17] <_nickel> gseguin: thats me
[11:27:17] <kinblas> :-)
[11:27:22] <gseguin> oh ok
[11:27:24] <gseguin> :)
[11:27:37] <_nickel> gseguin: I see how it is
[11:27:44] <_nickel> I'd rather hang out with Kin too
[11:27:46] <_nickel> :D
[11:27:48] <toddparker> _nickel: yeah, i'll get him...
[11:27:56] <_nickel> toddparker: thanks man
[11:28:11] <kinblas> gseguin: we'll do a coding day when _nickel is up here in Nov
[11:28:28] <gseguin> kinblas: yeah that's what I wanted to talk about
[11:28:33] <_nickel> kinblas: which reminds me I need to requeset an extra day from the conference folks on the hotel
[11:28:37] <toddparker> odd, I don't get a suggetion
[11:28:39] <toddparker> s
[11:28:43] <toddparker> ays i'm up to date
[11:28:50] <toddparker> but if it could work, anywhere, let's do it
[11:28:54] <kinblas> toddparker: try erasing everything ans typing in 'squ'
[11:28:58] <kinblas> it will suggest squat
[11:29:32] <toddparker> it didn't suggest squat :)
[11:29:39] <kinblas> did it suggest squ?
[11:29:42] <scottjehl> woop
[11:29:46] <scottjehl> hey team
[11:29:48] <_nickel> scottjehl: yo!
[11:29:53] <toddparker> woah
[11:29:54] <toddparker> just worked
[11:29:56] <gseguin> scottjehl: howdy
[11:29:58] <Wilto> toddparker: Ba-dum tss.
[11:30:00] <toddparker> what the...
[11:30:04] <_nickel> I'll message you so we don't flatten the convo here
[11:30:10] <scottjehl> k
[11:30:13] <toddparker> Squ >> suggests "Say"
[11:30:30] <kinblas> toddparker: so you can dismiss it right?
[11:30:34] <kinblas> tapping the X?
[11:30:42] <toddparker> yep
[11:30:58] <toddparker> works like a charm
[11:32:46] <toddparker> kinblas: just tagged #2369 to you
[11:33:09] <kinblas> toddparker: ok, one of the samples is busted
[11:33:23] <kinblas> toddparker: the first one from the guy who filed the bug
[11:33:41] <kinblas> hopefully the 2nd one from another person is enough to demo the bug
[11:40:45] <toddparker> looking forward to seeing you _nickel
[11:52:35] <eddiemonge> toddmparker (toddparker): whats priority for this week that I can work on?
[12:11:57] <toddparker> eddiemonge: download builder with scottjehl
[12:17:08] <eddiemonge> scottjehl: you around?
[12:17:17] <scottjehl> present!
[12:17:26] <scottjehl> how goes, eddiemonge?
[12:18:10] <eddiemonge> where are we at with that? i know there were those emails but i dont remember if there was a resolution
[12:20:35] <scottjehl> well, I think we need to just start building something and figure out what we need
[12:21:11] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #74: SUCCESS in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/74/
[12:21:11] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jblas: Disabled the workaround for issue 785 (jQM text input forces use of iOS auto-correction) on iOS 5 devices since it appears to be fixed. This is still a problem on iOS 4.x and earlier.
[12:21:12] <scottjehl> something that worked with/like the make processes would be awesome
[12:21:28] <scottjehl> not my area of expertise :/
[12:21:52] <eddiemonge> do we have a front-end yet? did we get all the dependencies worked out? cc kinblas
[12:26:22] <scottjehl> I started one which I'd be happy to continue filling out
[12:27:48] <scottjehl> https://gist.github.com/f830efe82699e0135134
[12:32:10] <eddiemonge> yeah that would be awesome if it was finished
[13:23:25] <toddparker> so what's everyone's availability this week?
[13:23:44] <kinblas> toddparker: I'm available for most of the week
[13:23:59] <kinblas> toddparker: little max distractions here and there, but for the most part focused on jqm
[13:24:13] <_nickel> toddparker: dood stoked to see you guys too!
[13:24:22] * _nickel has dated himself with "dood"
[13:24:47] <_nickel> toddparker: looks like the weather is actually pretty nice in Boston eh?
[13:25:02] <_nickel> I'm still going to bring my shell but doesn't look like I'll be frozen or anything
[13:25:45] <kinblas> _nickel: sea shell?
[13:25:48] <kinblas> :-)
[13:26:33] <_nickel> kinblas: http://cdn.epicski.com/e/e5/265x265px-LS-hustle.jpg
[13:27:22] <kinblas> _nickel: heh when I saw "hustle" I thought it was going to be an animated gif of some disco
[13:28:03] <_nickel> lol
[13:31:48] <_nickel> toddparker: it looks like I'm going to miss the speaker dinner and after party though since I'm flying in from New Orleans
[13:33:06] <toddparker> _nickel - did you get an email saying when the speaker dinner was?
[13:37:49] <_nickel> toddparker: no only that there was an after party
[13:38:20] <_nickel> I actually arrive in time to make it to the after party but I'll get there at like 10:20 or something so I don't know that it makes much sense
[13:38:31] <_nickel> maybe I'll call you guys when I land to see if anyone is still there
[14:06:42] <kinblas> _nickel: ping
[14:11:40] <toddparker> sounds good _nickel
[14:11:50] <toddparker> scott and I have been doing some testing not he iOS5 stuff
[14:11:58] <toddparker> it's general feeling pretty solid
[14:12:20] <toddparker> we're thinking we're going to need to disable zoom because things get wonky with the overflows and fixed toolbars and such
[14:12:23] <toddparker> bummer
[14:12:31] <toddparker> tho maybe we expose as an option
[14:12:58] <toddparker> we definitely need to set a 3D transform to force it to render widgets on an inner scrolling page
[14:13:06] <toddparker> but not backface
[14:20:30] <kinblas> toddparker: scottjehl: ping
[14:21:07] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #75: SUCCESS in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/75/
[14:21:07] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Added improved collpsible theming docs
[14:21:08] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Fixed a code typo in the theme example
[14:34:15] <toddparker> hey kinblas
[14:34:27] <kinblas> toddparker: hey
[14:34:34] <toddparker> hey hey
[14:34:58] <kinblas> toddparker: I was going to ask you and scottjehl about whether we should be firing off the change event from a select prior to closing the overlay/dialog
[14:35:07] <kinblas> but I guess I should test how natives behave
[14:35:27] <toddparker> that's probably the best approach
[14:35:32] <toddparker> saw that message
[14:35:35] <kinblas> Issue 2369 is due to the fact that the guy is firing off his own changepage
[14:35:57] <kinblas> toddparker: ok I need to do some testing of native select elements first
[14:36:17] <kinblas> toddparker: the 2nd guy's problem is probablly wonky android transitions
[14:36:25] <kinblas> so its something totally un-related
[14:36:31] <_nickel> kinblas: pong
[14:36:39] <toddparker> yeah
[14:36:48] <toddparker> if this isn't critical, you can wait too
[14:36:48] <kinblas> _nickel: hmmm I forgot why I pinged
[14:36:54] <toddparker> not sure how important you think this one is
[14:37:12] <kinblas> toddparker: well I've seen lots of folks firing off commands onchange of a select
[14:37:29] <kinblas> so it seems we should make sure we have the ordering in parity with native
[14:37:44] <kinblas> what that is... I have to investigate
[14:38:01] <_nickel> kinblas: yay event ordering!
[14:38:34] <_nickel> kinblas: let me know if you remember
[14:38:41] <kinblas> _nickel: yeah, it's always interesting to see wha tthe dffernt browsers do
[14:38:46] <kinblas> tedious though
[14:39:09] <toddparker> kinblas: makes sense
[14:39:15] <toddparker> seems like that is used frequently
[14:39:24] <kinblas> toddparker: are there any other higher priorities?
[14:39:56] <kinblas> _nickel: oh yeah I was going to respond to your email inquiry about the bitmap caching
[14:40:15] <toddparker> this was assigned to )ni
[14:40:23] <toddparker> _nickel but it should be looked at
[14:40:24] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2001
[14:40:24] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2001 on jquery-mobile, reported by jeffholmes (2m, 3w ago): IE7/8 Form Submit Bug
[14:40:39] <toddparker> or this one
[14:40:40] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1106
[14:40:41] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1106 on jquery-mobile, reported by keshin (7m, 1w ago): checkradiobox widget still work even it's disabled
[14:40:50] <toddparker> i can assign either of those if you have time
[14:41:02] <_nickel> top one is assigned to me
[14:41:20] <kinblas> _nickel: so are you still fixing bugs for rc1?
[14:41:22] <_nickel> toddparker: I'll grab the second one too though
[14:41:26] <_nickel> kinblas: yessir
[14:41:36] <kinblas> ok
[14:41:45] <toddparker> _nickel - you want #1106
[14:41:53] <_nickel> toddparker: got it
[14:41:56] <kinblas> toddparker: ok, I'll look into the select event ordering to see if it's an issue we should fix
[14:42:03] <toddparker> thanks kinblas
[14:42:07] <kinblas> I still have some documentation backlog
[14:42:14] <kinblas> and I think I have one more bug
[14:42:19] <kinblas> regarding the event ids
[14:42:21] <toddparker> that would be good to look at kinblas
[14:42:28] <toddparker> our docs always need love
[14:45:38] <kinblas> toddparker: so that last critical bug on my plate
[14:45:52] <kinblas> toddparker: 1373
[14:46:09] <toddparker> right #1373
[14:46:20] <kinblas> it's really only an issue on multi-touch devices ... I need to test android devices
[14:46:21] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1373
[14:46:21] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1373 on jquery-mobile, reported by jblas (5m, 3w ago): Need to bullet-proof virtual mouse event code for multi-touch case ...
[14:46:36] <kinblas> it looks like they recycle ids on xoom
[14:46:47] <kinblas> it's multi-touch is way wonky
[14:47:00] <toddparker> man, honeycomb is a bag of hurt
[14:47:03] <kinblas> so I'm a bit nervous
[14:47:23] <kinblas> about adding code to restrict based on id at this point without some serious testing on several devices
[14:47:30] <toddparker> so it looks like you just want to only kick in the mouse stuff if a single finger is down, right?
[14:47:36] <toddparker> otherwise, do notthing
[14:47:47] <kinblas> toddparker: yeah, or do a cancel
[14:48:17] <kinblas> toddparker: but there's the issue of seeing what android and others do
[14:48:22] <kinblas> for example if multiple fingers go down
[14:48:30] <kinblas> mouse events are suppressed on ios
[14:48:34] <kinblas> are they suppressed on android?
[14:48:37] <kinblas> not sure yet
[14:48:50] <kinblas> so anyways, I was thinking that could be a time-suck
[14:48:57] <kinblas> so I've been fixing/looking at nav bugs
[14:49:06] <kinblas> to make sure those are solid
[14:49:41] <kinblas> I think we're in relatively good shape (nav-wise) with the last batch of nav/click/pushstate fixes post-B3
[14:53:56] <_nickel> kinblas: this makes me happy
[14:54:17] <_nickel> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/793#issuecomment-2204154
[14:54:18] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #793 on jquery-mobile, reported by jaybuys (8m, 2w ago): orientationchange event returns wrong values on Android
[14:54:26] <kinblas> _nickel: same here
[14:54:26] <_nickel> instructions for testing at the bottom
[14:54:37] <_nickel> kinblas: the lord knows we've got it covered with testing
[15:00:07] <kinblas> _nickel: so someone was asking for a pageremoved notification
[15:00:22] <kinblas> _nickel: makes sense as a hook for clean-up
[15:01:06] <kinblas> _nickel: question is should we fire before or after the actual dom removal, or both? Obviously a hook before should allow folks to preventDefault()
[15:01:28] * kinblas leans towards both, but would be cool with one before
[15:01:55] <_nickel> kinblas: I would like to see a jquery "removed" event
[15:02:12] <toddparker> thanks _nickel
[15:02:18] <toddparker> we'll take a look tomorrow
[15:02:21] <kinblas> _nickel: not sure what you mean
[15:02:49] <kinblas> _nickel: do you mean at the widget level?
[15:02:59] <toddparker> pageremovestart and complete?
[15:02:59] <_nickel> kinblas: at the element level
[15:03:13] <_nickel> $( "#foo" ).remove()
[15:03:18] <toddparker> is that something you think we should ad now?
[15:03:18] <_nickel> realizing that would slow things down
[15:03:32] <_nickel> anyway I'm not adding anything useful to the conversation
[15:03:52] <kinblas> toddparker: the notification would be at the single point where we remove the page
[15:06:47] <toddparker> but is that too late?
[15:06:54] <toddparker> just going with what you said above
[15:06:59] <toddparker> if you wanted to prevent it
[15:07:57] <kinblas> toddparker: oh you mean if we did it at the jquery level?
[15:08:36] <kinblas> toddparker: I was just thinking about at the $.mobile._bindPageRemove() level which is the bottleneck for the removal
[15:09:19] <toddparker> k
[15:09:31] <kinblas> toddparker: or were you asking, why are we adding this now?
[15:12:12] <toddparker> asking IF you wanted to add this now
[15:12:19] <toddparker> new feature and all
[15:12:28] <toddparker> if it's simple and _nickel agrees :)
[15:12:30] <kinblas> toddparker: heh ok that's what I thought :-P
[15:12:55] <toddparker> on another topic - we have a ton is issues against fixed headers/footers
[15:12:56] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/search?q=fixed%20footer
[15:13:16] <toddparker> is this something we can improve?
[15:13:29] <toddparker> do we keep a ton of tickets open of close as can't fix?
[15:13:34] <toddparker> known limitation?
[15:13:52] <kinblas> toddparker: are any of those prioritized?
[15:14:07] <kinblas> toddparker: I can start looking into some of those
[15:14:12] <toddparker> actually, even more:
[15:14:12] <kinblas> after I look at the select thingie
[15:14:13] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/search?q=fixed
[15:14:42] <toddparker> i guess we should have you give this one more pass
[15:14:51] <toddparker> i say we get it as good as we possibly can
[15:14:55] <toddparker> then close these
[15:15:12] <kinblas> toddparker: agreed, so you want me to look at the fixes first?
[15:15:35] <toddparker> for fixed
[15:16:17] <toddparker> i'd say, look at select timing
[15:16:24] <toddparker> then take a fresh look at fixed toolbars
[15:16:35] <toddparker> we also have a bunch of pulls that we could take a look at
[15:16:40] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2331
