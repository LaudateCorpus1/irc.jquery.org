[00:27:29] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4757 on jquery-mobile (agcolom; 11m, 13s ago): Collapse method on collapsible set
[00:28:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: actually a collapsible set can have only one collapsible open at the time
[00:29:21] <uGoMobi> so it would more be like... when you trigger collapse on a set, the one that is expanded will collapse
[00:32:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: and this is already possible :)
[00:32:24] <uGoMobi> $("#set").children().trigger( "collapse" );

[02:39:53] <uGoMobi> hmm no bot today :(
[03:32:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The popup position is off because $( document ).height() is reported wrong.
[03:33:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It tells me that popup/index.html is 636px tall! That's impossible!
[03:33:31] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wait! Did we switch to jQuery 1.7.2 or something?
[03:33:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep! We switched to jQuery 1.7.2 ...
[03:35:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah
[03:35:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but it seems only be wrong on webkit browsers
[03:35:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[03:35:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Still, the regression is because of jQuery.
[03:36:04] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: FF is still working, while they are off on Chrome as well
[03:36:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[03:36:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep. So, I guess it's not an iPad issue.
[03:36:23] <_|Nix|_> It's a webkit issue.
[03:36:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, jQuery 1.7.2. seems to report wrong value for height() on webkit
[03:37:10] <uGoMobi> that no was regarding not being an iPad (only) issue
[03:37:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, sorry, that's what I meant to say ...
[03:37:19] <uGoMobi> haha
[03:37:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm kinda loopy today ...
[03:37:57] <_|Nix|_> OK, so ... WTF?! file a jQuery bug?
[03:38:24] <_|Nix|_> Wow! Totally broken.
[03:38:32] <_|Nix|_> Maybe it's already fixed in git.
[03:38:49] <uGoMobi> we could test with latest jQuery code
[03:39:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good idea.
[03:41:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Disaster. Total breakage. Looks like $.attrFn is no longer defined.
[03:42:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this sucks
[03:43:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah ...
[03:47:40] <_|Nix|_> Great ... I can't build jquery from source :(
[03:48:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no grunt?
[03:49:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I dunno ... it's dying with some js error ...
[03:49:57] <_|Nix|_> OK ... now it worked.
[03:50:19] <_|Nix|_> OK ... 1.7.1 fails, but 1.7.2 I can build.
[03:54:41] <_|Nix|_> I have found the earliest version of jQ that's post-1.7.1 and that builds ... let's hope the height is not broken yet.
[03:55:48] <_|Nix|_> OK ... lucky ... $( document ).height() is good, and jQ builds. So, let's run a bisect to see which commit breaks it.
[04:35:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I feel like planting a big, honkin' nuke in M$ headquarters, and pushing the big red button when I'm at a safe distance.
[04:35:53] <toddmparker_> once you guys track down what is causign the breakage, we can coordinate with the core guys
[04:36:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The comment for the commit that breaks the height for webkit: Fix #3838, $(document).height() incorrect in IE6
[04:36:25] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: 5cae50e66e34c277412c01ccb1c24bd6a85d2d8a breaks it.
[04:36:41] <_|Nix|_> IE6 needs to die, die, die!
[04:36:54] <_|Nix|_> Why doesn't anyone write a botnet that takes out IE6?
[04:38:14] <_|Nix|_> Ok, the height is incorrect in IE6? Well, in the words of one Peter Weller: "You must have me confused with someone who gives a sheet!"
[04:39:05] <_|Nix|_> "Screamers" - great movie, and that line - unforgettable.
[04:39:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hahaha
[04:41:15] <_|Nix|_> I haven't been able to check whether it was fixed, because master currently doesn't work. I'll do another bisect to get the latest that works, and see if there it's still broken.
[04:41:40] <_|Nix|_> I mean, we know it's broken in 1.7.2 so, if they did fix it, it must be after.
[04:44:11] <_|Nix|_> Argh ... building with grunt is not exactly conducive to doing git bisect ...
[04:44:25] <_|Nix|_> ... unless you have grunt installed globally.
[04:53:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I checked the file that was changed by that commit and it was the last commit in the history
[04:54:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so I guess it hasn't been fixed yet
[04:59:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, of course! I'm an idiot ...
[05:00:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good work!
[05:07:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, there are a bunch of commits that touch src/dimensions.js since then ...
[05:08:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: 9 commits, in particular.
[05:08:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just because I'm paranoid, I'll try to find buildable commits for each of those.

[05:13:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'll check that one.
[05:18:26] <toddmparker_> promising
[05:19:00] <toddmparker_> Wilto will be in in about an hour or so
[05:19:04] <toddmparker_> he had some theories
[05:19:22] <toddmparker_> but i don't think he was doing this type of detective work
[05:21:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this var is interesting: doc[ clientProp ]
[05:34:32] <gnarf> is mobile stable on 1.8 yet?
[05:34:55] <gnarf> UI had to issue a point release to get 1.8 stability
[05:37:47] <uGoMobi> hi gnarf, no JQM latest stable version (1.1.1.) is on 1.7.1
[05:38:54] <gnarf> uGoMobi: what do i need to do to run the units against jQuery git?
[05:40:34] <uGoMobi> gnarf: not sure
[05:40:43] <gnarf> also - if i were to try to get this working with 1.8 - which branch should I base on?
[05:40:46] <uGoMobi> gnarf: jQuery code is inlcuded
[05:41:04] <uGoMobi> in mobile git
[05:42:06] <uGoMobi> master branch
[05:42:59] <uGoMobi> or if you want to use latest stable version... 1.1-stable branch tag 1.1.1 final
[05:47:08] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/events/touch.js#L20 ???
[05:48:51] <gnarf> Pretty sure this should just be removed
[05:49:20] <gnarf> apparently someone wanted .attr( "touchstart", fn ) to work as a event setter?
[05:50:59] <gnarf> either way - .attrFn doesn't exist in 1.8
[05:51:09] <gnarf> it was never documented

[06:00:05] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gnarf37 (3m, 8s ago): Removing references to attrFn to support jQuery 1.8 core
[06:00:16] <gnarf> _|Nix|_: ^^^ that fixes your 1.8 issue
[06:27:49] <toddparker_> Good morning
[06:30:39] <gnarf> toddparker_: check that pull
[06:30:51] <gnarf> toddparker_: i think this should get closer to letting 1.8 work on mobile
[06:31:06] <toddparker_> Will do, thanks for that
[06:31:25] <toddparker_> (I'm walking to work)
[06:31:27] <gnarf> and i dunno if you want to release a 1.1.2 to get 1.8 support or not - we did for UI ( 1.8.22 )
[06:31:43] <gnarf> im heading afk for a few myself
[06:32:09] <toddparker_> 1.1.2 is in the cards so definitely
[07:18:14] <Wilto> Man, I tune out for a _few months_ and everything goes right to hell.
[07:18:27] <Wilto> What’s the word, my good brosephs?
[07:19:09] <uGoMobi> hey Wilto
[07:19:21] <Wilto> Catching up now.
[07:19:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we only need to change one line to fix popups with 1.7.2
[07:20:08] <Wilto> agcolom: Zero is hangin’ in there. I had a trainer come in yesterday to discuss some stuff; he is a bite-y little dude.
[07:20:42] <Wilto> He is both stubborn and prone to fits of anger. I like ’em.
[07:21:01] <uGoMobi> Wilto: your dog named Zero?
[07:21:13] <Wilto> Hah, yeah. He came with the name.
[07:21:27] <uGoMobi> ah right
[07:21:27] <Wilto> I nicknamed him “Falsy.”
[07:21:37] <Wilto> Because I don’t get out much.
[07:21:39] <uGoMobi> he might need a shrink some day ;)
[07:22:58] <uGoMobi> or no signs of an inferiority complex yet ?
[07:23:13] <Wilto> The opposite, really.
[07:23:22] <uGoMobi> oh ok cool
[07:23:49] <uGoMobi> Zero the Hero
[07:23:49] <Wilto> He fronts at way bigger dogs, people, large trucks. He tried to, uh… attack some road construction, because it was loud.
[07:23:56] <Wilto> …we’re working on it.
[07:24:02] <uGoMobi> haha
[07:24:22] <Wilto> Little maverick hunter, he is. Shout-out to my video game nerds.
[07:24:32] <Wilto> Anyway! iOS. Popups. What’s the score?
[07:24:49] <uGoMobi> the bug is in core
[07:24:58] <Wilto> DAMMIT, CORE
[07:25:04] <Wilto> It’s a change to height(), yeah?
[07:25:05] <uGoMobi> but we only need to change one line
[07:25:11] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:25:21] <Wilto> Looks like the popup is calculating the browser chrome as well in iOS, which is a Known Shenanigan.
[07:25:41] <uGoMobi> but only affects $( document ).height();
[07:25:45] <Wilto> I know we’ve accounted for that elsewhere, in conjunction with Kin Blas’ orientation stuff.
[07:25:54] <Wilto> $( window ).height() too, yeah?
[07:26:04] <uGoMobi> so $( window ).height() is not a problem
[07:26:07] <uGoMobi> nope
[07:26:13] <uGoMobi> that's good news
[07:26:21] <uGoMobi> because we use that a couple of times
[07:26:22] <Wilto> Oh, sweet.
[07:26:32] <uGoMobi> and document height() only once in popup
[07:26:51] <Wilto> I was gonna say `window.innerHeight`.
[07:27:04] <Wilto> Yeah, line 352 or so, right?
[07:27:29] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/popup.js#L350
[07:27:36] <uGoMobi> almost ;)
[07:28:16] <Wilto> Won’t the window height trip iOS up after orientation change?
[07:29:34] <uGoMobi> how do you mean?
[07:31:30] <uGoMobi> oh, with window.innerHeight
[07:34:26] <uGoMobi> this is the JQ core function without the bug https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/a52391aa1dcf3f28306e274e1b2d7f0affc4e725/src/dimensions.js#L41
[07:35:43] <uGoMobi> so I was thinking... lets just create our own height() function and check what of those 5 return highest value
[07:57:57] <Wilto> I assume you said “create our own height() function” in a mad-scientist kind of way, and I like it.
[08:06:39] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Just double-check and make sure that doesn’t already exist somewhere; maybe we could just expose it if so.
[08:07:33] <Wilto> I’ll be around if you need changes tested across all the devices.
[08:07:38] <uGoMobi> Wilto: exist where?
[08:08:01] <Wilto> I could _swear_ we already dealt with this height thing somewhere…
[08:08:12] <uGoMobi> but that's all window height()
[08:08:30] <Wilto> We’ll have to pull in the current orientation, as well.
[08:08:39] <Wilto> http://tripleodeon.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/table.html
[08:09:16] <Wilto> TL;DR: iOS doesn’t know which way is up when it comes to height.
[08:09:17] <uGoMobi> what I meant is that JQ's height() function checks 5 values if the element is "document":
[08:09:31] <uGoMobi> document.documentElement.clientHeight,
[08:09:31] <uGoMobi> document.body.scrollHeight,
[08:09:31] <uGoMobi> document.body.offsetHeight,
[08:09:31] <uGoMobi> document.documentElement.scrollHeight,
[08:09:31] <uGoMobi> document.documentElement.offsetHeight;
[08:09:47] <uGoMobi> and it returns the highest value
[08:09:57] <gseguin> johnbender, uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4760 for your review
[08:09:57] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gseguin (3m, 4s ago): Proposed fix for #4721: Added a "listviewbeforefilter" event
[08:11:02] <uGoMobi> the only problem is that in 1.7.2. an IF statement has been added that messes things up
[08:11:07] <uGoMobi> gseguin: ok
[08:12:27] <uGoMobi> Wilto: so if we do Math.max for those 5 values we do exactly the same as what height() would have returned without the bug (1.7.1) and that was working on all devices
[08:12:49] <uGoMobi> that's what I meant with "our own height() function"
[08:12:55] <Wilto> Ahh…
[08:13:26] <toddparker> good to hear you're close on this uGoMobi
[08:13:35] <toddparker> some freaky stuff
[08:13:36] <Wilto> I’d like to see a fix that could be merged back into core… What’re your thoughts there?
[08:13:50] <toddparker> wish we has switched to 17.2 earlier
[08:14:00] <uGoMobi> Wilto: the IF statement has already been removed in core latest
[08:14:03] <toddparker> we need to be testing like mad on 1.8…even bigger changes afoot
[08:14:13] <Wilto> Oh, sweet.
[08:14:15] <Wilto> ?cc
[08:14:16] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[08:14:18] <toddparker> thanks gseguin
[08:14:32] <Wilto> Stay the course then, uGoMobi! Let me know if testing is needed.
[08:15:00] <toddparker> gseguin - we'll need to up date the docs with that too
[08:15:18] <uGoMobi> I wanted to ask _|Nix|_ opinion first before pushing to master
[08:15:27] <gseguin> I hope it's not too simplistic but it should address that use case at least
[08:15:32] <uGoMobi> not sure he is around
[08:16:37] <toddparker> haven't seen him yet
[08:16:53] <toddparker> uGoMobi: if you want us to test this, just say the word
[08:16:57] <Wilto> Now that I think about it, we’d be duplicating a lot for that fix… would it make sense to just take the greater of core’s .height() and $( window ).height()?
[08:17:02] <toddparker> if it checks out on devices and unit tests...
[08:17:37] <Wilto> toddparker: Should we get intern[ 0 ] up in here, so he’s at-the-ready?
[08:17:56] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Re-reading, what I have just said to you makes very little sense.
[08:18:15] <uGoMobi> we need the document height
[08:18:20] <uGoMobi> not the window height
[08:18:49] <Wilto> Oh man, yeah.
[08:18:51] <Wilto> Right.
[08:20:09] <Wilto> This is why I stick to CSS.
[08:20:33] <uGoMobi> Wilto: I am going back to CSS  ASAP as well ;)
[08:21:45] <Wilto> uGoMobi: We’re getting an intern in here now, for all your height-testing needs.
[08:22:06] <uGoMobi> Wilto: ok cool
[08:22:20] <uGoMobi> I am going to run test local and then push to master
[08:23:10] <Wilto> Oh, whatup jlembeck.
[08:23:14] <uGoMobi> toddparker: Wilto: the best way to test this is with a popup with content that is higher than the screen
[08:23:19] <jlembeck> Hey
[08:27:33] <Wilto> uGoMobi: It seemed pretty easily reproducible with the “developer console” switched on.
[08:27:47] <Wilto> And I use the term “iOS developer console” loosely.

[08:30:02] <Wilto> Quick work.
[08:30:30] <uGoMobi> Wilto: the function that $(document).height() was used for is meant to make sure the bottom of the popup is not cutoff when the height of the popup is bigger than the screen height
[08:32:25] <uGoMobi> I will test with a large image if that still works as expected
[08:34:21] <Wilto> The browser chrome offset issue is solved for sure, uGoMobi.
[08:34:51] <toddparker> uGoMobi: FIXED
[08:34:54] <toddparker> nice work
[08:35:16] <uGoMobi> credits to _|Nix|_ for finding the core commit that broke it
[08:35:26] <toddparker> can someone check to see if we're fading in the overlay for popups?
[08:35:33] <toddparker> if so, let's not
[08:35:47] <toddparker> popups are slow on ipads
[08:35:52] <toddparker> fast on my phone tho
[08:42:49] <johnbender> toddparker: large area to composite?
[08:57:12] <toddparker> johnbender: probably
[08:57:29] <toddparker> that's why i'd rather take it easy on iPads by not fading in the overlay
[08:59:18] <uGoMobi> what is the url of core latest?
[09:06:44] <toddparker> uGoMobi: asking
[09:07:01] <uGoMobi> toddparker: do you have Android 2.3.4 there? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3277#issuecomment-7308349

[09:07:46] <uGoMobi> the comment says buttons don't loose focus style on Android 2.3.4.
[09:09:01] <toddparker> i have a 2.3.4
[09:09:04] <toddparker> opening /test
[09:10:05] <uGoMobi> I don't see it on 4.0
[09:11:52] <toddparker> popups aren't closing
[09:12:04] <toddparker> page is crazy slow to load. map? video?
[09:12:26] <toddparker> now it's being better
[09:13:11] <toddparker> on the popup page, when i close it, i see the focus outline briefly on the origin button then it goes away
[09:13:15] <toddparker> the opposite of sticky
[09:14:38] <toddparker> commented uGoMobi
[09:14:48] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok thanks
[09:14:53] <toddparker> so overlays are fading
[09:14:54] <toddparker> screen: $( "<div class='ui-screen-hidden ui-popup-screen fade'></div>" ),
[09:14:59] <toddparker> line 124
[09:16:07] <toddparker> oddly, if i remove that class there i don't see an overlay bg
[09:18:22] <uGoMobi> toddparker: it's in the CSS
[09:18:28] <toddparker> ah!
[09:18:32] <uGoMobi> .ui-popup-screen.fade.in {

[09:18:51] <uGoMobi> if you removed class fade it never gets .5 opacity
[09:19:15] <uGoMobi> I see we use keyframes for the fade in
[09:19:39] <uGoMobi> wonder if it makes a difference if we just do transform ease
[09:20:29] <uGoMobi> transition ease I mean
[09:21:55] <toddparker> no difference
[09:22:01] <toddparker> think he issue is the length of that page
[09:22:06] <uGoMobi> ok
[09:23:57] <toddparker> yep, smooth with the fade if i cop the page in half
[09:24:54] <uGoMobi> do you want to remove the fading at all or just not using it by default?
[09:25:06] <toddparker> the photo is tiling too
[09:25:17] <toddparker> if i remove the transition, no issues
[09:25:46] <uGoMobi> if you use fade for the popup it's nice if the overlay fades too
[09:26:58] <johnbender> anyone have an opinion on was the start and stop event names should be for the slider?
[09:27:10] <johnbender> "slidermovestart" and "slidermovestop"
[09:27:13] <johnbender> is what I have now
[09:27:26] <johnbender> "sliderstart" and "sliderstop" are ambiguous imho
[09:27:36] <johnbender> toddparker: uGoMobi: gseguin ^
[09:27:37] <toddparker> slidestart
[09:27:39] <toddparker> ?
[09:27:51] <johnbender> toddparker: well it has to be prefixed with the widget name
[09:27:56] <johnbender> using _trigger
[09:27:58] <johnbender> that's the convention
[09:28:51] <uGoMobi> +1 for sliderstart and sliderstop
[09:29:38] <toddparker> ok
[09:29:42] <johnbender> toddparker: do you know if UI handles this a certain way?
[09:29:42] <toddparker> sounds ok to me
[09:30:34] <johnbender> toddparker: looks like they use slidestart
[09:30:36] <johnbender> :/
[09:30:45] <johnbender> which breaks with the _trigger convention in the widget factory
[09:30:55] <toddparker> they do have a slider
[09:31:20] <johnbender> toddparker: just looked
[09:31:23] <toddparker> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[09:31:28] <johnbender> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/
[09:31:32] <johnbender> toddparker: jinx
[09:31:33] <johnbender> :D
[09:31:45] <toddparker> jinxie
[09:32:27] <johnbender> Tripple stamp it, no erasies, touch blue make it true!
[09:33:11] <johnbender> toddparker: let me go ask them
[09:34:36] <toddparker> :)
[09:34:56] <toddparker> so let's try to sync up where we can on the api
[09:35:33] <johnbender> toddparker: you can set the _trigger prefix
[09:35:38] <johnbender> slidestart it is
[09:36:18] <toddparker> just thinking that max, min, step should probably be listed as options
[09:36:36] <toddparker> we parse these from html but still are options, right?
[09:36:45] <johnbender> toddparker: checking
[09:36:48] <toddparker> value too?
[09:36:53] <toddparker> just looking at ui here
[09:37:02] <johnbender> toddparker: false
[09:37:07] <johnbender> we do not have them as prototype options
[09:37:14] <johnbender> or method options :(
[09:38:09] <toddparker> but should they be technically?
[09:38:23] <toddparker> more of a question on how we're handling those
[09:38:35] <toddparker> i need to hop into a meeting
[09:38:40] <johnbender> toddparker: kk
[09:38:45] <toddparker> think we're cool on the position stuff
[09:38:55] <toddparker> uGoMobi: you're building those advanced popup demos?
[09:39:18] <toddparker> wondering if we should move a lot of the real world demos into separate pages to lighten up this page
[09:39:34] <johnbender> toddparker: possibly not since they should be defined on the range input really
[09:39:36] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yeah will work on that this weekend
[09:39:38] <toddparker> we can link to them prominently from here but this page is loooong and that impact perf
[09:40:11] <toddparker> looks like 1.2 will be monday at the earliest
[09:40:24] <toddparker> can we try to test 1.8rc today?
[09:40:39] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I agree... the examples with iframes better go to a new page
[09:52:11] <toddparker> yep
[09:55:37] <toddparker> nice johnbender - think we can close that issue after we add those to the docs
[09:55:58] <johnbender> toddparker: well the issue is already closed
[09:55:59] <johnbender> but yes
[09:56:03] <johnbender> unless there's another one
[09:56:11] <johnbender> or at least I thought it was

[09:56:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4756 on jquery-mobile (johnbender; 22h, 35m ago): Slider input alterations update the slider ui on blur
[09:56:44] <johnbender> I've got a solution for that as well
[10:25:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/anqIug
[10:25:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] bind to vmouseup for refresh Fixes #4756 - John Bender
[10:25:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] test mouseup refresh - John Bender
[10:25:45] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[10:25:59] <johnbender> toddparker: are there browsers other than chrome that provide the up and down arrows
[10:26:02] <johnbender> s?
[10:29:16] <uGoMobi> johnbender: do you mean the arrows on the input field of the slider?
[10:30:27] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yar
[10:30:40] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I'd like to test
[10:31:40] <johnbender> uGoMobi: safari works but I never tried it before hand
[10:32:13] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I think all desktop browsers have those arrows
[10:32:24] <uGoMobi> the major ones at least
[10:32:29] <uGoMobi> Opera
[10:32:51] <uGoMobi> Safari, Chrome
[10:33:31] <uGoMobi> ah Firefox not
[10:33:32] <johnbender> uGoMobi: looks like safari was firing the change event
[10:33:35] <johnbender> just chrome
[10:33:41] <johnbender> oh well
[10:33:43] <johnbender> bug fixed
[10:33:45] <uGoMobi> johnbender: want me to test something?
[10:34:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I just added a mouseup binding to the input element
[10:34:11] <johnbender> it checks if the value has changed
[10:37:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/F-MuZw
[10:37:10] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] move value tracking into the refresh to make sure its captured as often as possible - John Bender
[10:37:18] <johnbender> uGoMobi: since chrome wasn't triggering the change event when those arrows were used
[10:37:29] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ah ok
[11:53:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm going to upgrade my distro, if I drop off for a while don't be scared :D
[11:56:38] <toddparker> johnbender: yeah, most desktop browser have a spinner arrows on numeric inputs (or soon will)
[11:56:46] <toddparker> how goes?
[12:06:48] <toddparker> gseguin, johnbender, _|Nix|_, uGoMobi, agcolom - need anything from me?
[12:06:58] <toddparker> i'm going to get pulled back into my meeting
[12:07:22] <toddparker> quiet here today :)
[12:07:27] <toddparker> good after yesterday
[12:14:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi:Any news on that jQuery regression?
[12:15:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I had to bail earlier in the middle of a git bisect hunt.
[12:15:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I pushed a fix
[12:15:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, great! How did you fix it? Did you patch jquery-1.7.2.js?
[12:16:26] <uGoMobi> the problem was only with $( document ).height();
[12:16:40] <uGoMobi> that's only used once
[12:17:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Really? Wow!
[12:17:21] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7268df3b73290667af7f60afd64b3d58c288731d
[12:17:22] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Jasper de Groot (3h, 50m ago): Popup: fix for $( document ).height() bug in core 1.7.2.
[12:17:59] <uGoMobi> that IF statement that caused the bug is already removed from core
[12:19:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. This is a good fix, but we need to keep this in mind if we ever need $( document ).height() again ...
[12:20:05] <uGoMobi> the code I added is exactly the same as what core uses to establish document height, but without the IF statement above it
[12:20:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah that's right
[12:20:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Alright, and the popups are back to normal ... riiiight?
[12:21:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, all good
[12:21:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: feels a bit like a quick fix, but it works
[12:21:47] <_|Nix|_> *whew* ... *wipe forehead*
[12:22:22] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono - we have no choice. Wonder though what everyone else who uses $( document ).height() will do - I mean, 1.7.2 is /the/ stable version of jQuery ...
[12:22:28] <uGoMobi> not sure if core is going to do a 1.7.3 release since 1.8 is coming up
[12:22:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know, eh? Exactly!
[12:22:52] <uGoMobi> if not we have to keep this in until 1.9
[12:23:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, no, 1.8 should be OK, since it's already fixed in master.
[12:23:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes but we also support two versions
[12:24:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, right.
[12:24:05] <uGoMobi> 1.7.2. and 1.6.4 will become 1.8 and 1.7.2
[12:24:12] <uGoMobi> until 1.9 is out
[12:24:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Good point.
[12:26:08] <_|Nix|_> I can't believe they didn't catch this regression ...
[12:26:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, strange thing is that the IF statement has been remove because it was causing issues on FF12
[12:27:19] <uGoMobi> while popup was still fine on FF, but all webkit browsers were off
[12:27:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, but it was removed too late. It was removed after 1.7.2 :(
[12:27:35] <uGoMobi> yeah I know :(
[12:28:09] <toddparker> worth raining this issue
[12:28:29] <toddparker> seems like this would cause issues elsewhere for folks
[12:28:45] <toddparker> maybe you can comment on that commit in core?
[12:28:50] <toddparker> so happy that's fixed
[12:28:58] <toddparker> so i think we're in good shape
[12:29:04] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Oh, no doubt ... although, 1.7.2 has been out for a while now, and nobody seems to be complaining about $( document ).height() ...
[12:29:09] <uGoMobi> toddparker: the issue is already fix in core
[12:29:14] <uGoMobi> fixed*
[12:29:18] <toddparker> in 1.8?
[12:29:27] <uGoMobi> but that was after 1.7.2.
[12:29:31] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: In master, which means it should be part of 1.8 ...
[12:29:34] <uGoMobi> yes, should be fine in 1.8
[12:29:37] <toddparker> i see
[12:29:42] <toddparker> and maybe 1.7.3
[12:29:52] <uGoMobi> will there be a 1.7.3.?
[12:30:42] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I think they're pressing for 1.8 ...
[12:31:00] <_|Nix|_> D000d ... popup centering is now awesome ...
[12:32:23] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: better than before?
[12:32:48] <uGoMobi> that would be strange because it is the same code
[12:32:49] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: No, I'm just re-appreciating it after the serious breakage I've seen for the past day.
[12:33:25] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Licking my wounds, as it were :)
[12:33:29] <uGoMobi> you're right _|Nix|_ , enjoy it
[12:34:02] <uGoMobi> it's a nice piece of work!
[12:34:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks!
[12:39:31] <toddparker> heh
[12:39:43] <toddparker> so andrew here is going to do a test pass now to check things out
[12:40:35] * _|Nix|_ crosses fingers, toes, hands, feet, and anything else that he finds crossable
[12:40:47] <uGoMobi> lol
[12:42:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: toddparker noticed that the fading overlay isn't looking to good on iPad
[12:44:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ok, so default transition to none?
[12:44:38] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: And then, Bam! darker background?
[12:44:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, might be better
[12:45:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: when you say "default" do you mean make it an option?
[12:45:28] <uGoMobi> or only fade when the popup itself has a transition as well?
[12:45:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You read my mind. I was gonna say: "Oh no, another option" ...
[12:45:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That latter is not bad.
[12:46:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lessee what toddparker thinks ...
[12:46:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: After all, you can have no overlayTheme, and then there's no transition either.
[12:46:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I think we can manage that with adding / not adding a certain class, correct?
[12:46:28] <toddparker> johnbender: can you review gseguin's pull
[12:46:29] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4760

[12:46:35] <toddparker> gotta go
[12:46:49] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: K L8R
[12:47:01] <uGoMobi> goodnight toddparker
[12:50:03] <uGoMobi> I have to go too
[12:50:19] <uGoMobi> we can look into overlay next week
[12:50:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: have a great weekend!
[13:18:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You too!
[14:02:36] <Wilto> How goes it, guys?
[14:07:22] <Wilto> I see, I see.
[14:32:02] <johnbender> gseguin: commenting on the event trigger but I'm still a bit confused
[14:32:30] <Wilto> ?mlm
[14:32:31] <bot-t> much like myself
[14:49:45] <johnbender> toddparker: responded to the pr
[14:49:55] <johnbender> sorry I was MIA
[14:49:59] <johnbender> updating to 12.04
[14:50:03] <johnbender> all is well
[15:08:20] <todd_> hi alll
[15:08:30] <toddparker> andrew tested popups in the usual devices and it's looking goof
[15:08:45] <toddparker> WP7.5 seems to not clear off the focus class very well
[15:08:53] <toddparker> but even android 2.2 was pretty snappy
[15:09:53] <toddparker> i'd like to maybe nix the overlay transition to start
[15:09:54] <toddparker> if it
[15:10:07] <toddparker> sit's feeling abrupt, we can think about an option
[15:10:12] <toddparker> rather keep it simple
[15:10:24] <toddparker> _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi ^^
[15:10:41] <toddparker> actually, i'm going to reverse myself
[15:11:03] <toddparker> the real issue was how huge the popup page is, not the transition
[15:11:05] <toddparker> carry on
[15:11:09] <johnbender> fact
[15:11:14] <toddparker> heading out, will check in this weekend
[15:11:24] <toddparker> and will get the blog post written
[15:20:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you have a link to that article that scott_gonzalez wrote about touch events?
[15:27:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: it would be pretty great if we could serve up the vmouse plugin by itself from the download builder
[15:27:46] <johnbender> that was an awkward point in my presentation
[16:12:43] <gseguin> johnbender: on master it's possible
[16:13:17] <gseguin> on 1.1.1 we have some required modules (don't know why we did that in the first place)
[16:47:29] <gseguin> johnbender: I updated that PR
[17:45:53] <johnbender> gseguin: kk let me look
[17:46:26] <johnbender> gseguin: any thoughts on just exposing the search input?
[17:46:38] <johnbender> or just telling people where it is?
