[08:32:35] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:54:30] <gseguin> uGoMobi: are you done with your changes?
[08:54:51] <uGoMobi> almost
[08:54:56] <uGoMobi> but it's a PR
[08:55:11] <gseguin> can I move the transition code into the transition folder?
[08:55:13] <uGoMobi> so will have to wait until review anyway
[08:55:20] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:55:21] <gseguin> that doesn't affect you, right?
[08:55:25] <uGoMobi> correct
[08:56:09] <toddparker> http://eightmedia.github.com/hammer.js/
[08:56:15] <toddparker> multi touch gestures
[08:56:33] <gseguin> yeah I had seen it a few weeks back
[08:56:52] <gseguin> it's pretty neat
[08:57:28] <gseguin> toddparker: the builder is back to a working state
[08:57:38] <gseguin> let's have testers test it
[08:58:25] <gseguin> I did a custom build yesterday and plugged it into our product and that worked well
[09:01:13] <toddparker> great gseguin
[09:01:22] <toddparker> i've been getting a request every day or two
[09:01:29] <toddparker> i just forward on the link right then
[09:01:38] <toddparker> probably have 20 people with links now
[09:01:53] <toddparker> great - so your build worked? sweet!
[09:02:00] <gseguin> I disabled build for 1.1
[09:02:09] <toddparker> ?
[09:02:12] <gseguin> just enabled 1.1.1-pre and 1.2-pre
[09:02:16] <toddparker> ah, ok
[09:02:28] <toddparker> so it looks into 1.1-stable and master for the files?
[09:02:31] <toddparker> cool
[09:02:37] <gseguin> yeah
[09:05:02] <toddparker> i need to whip up a google doc for today's agenda
[09:25:05] <toddparker> agenda for today's call here - https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yAzrvogkEdnWl7v3I_rspXtU3mAgZh4cVoYmUssdKN0/edit#
[09:25:24] <toddparker> please try to add update bullet points under your name ahead of the call
[09:25:39] <toddparker> and add open issues to discuss in the next section
[09:55:32] <toddparker> wow uGoMobi - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4498
[09:55:33] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by uGoMobi (5m, 4s ago): Standardize buttons and form
[09:55:40] <toddparker> epic
[09:55:47] <uGoMobi> :-)
[09:56:14] <toddparker> do you have a test page of some sort to compare?
[09:56:47] <toddparker> what needs to be tested more on our side (platforms)
[09:57:02] <toddparker> and what demo pages illustrate things easliy
[09:57:07] <uGoMobi> test page other than the link i posted in comment?
[09:57:10] <toddparker> love to land this
[09:57:23] <toddparker> i'm a moron
[09:57:35] <toddparker> amazing work
[09:57:44] <uGoMobi> something strange here
[09:57:59] <uGoMobi> i used css and js from master on june 4th
[09:58:11] <uGoMobi> when i inspect code i see popups
[09:58:25] <uGoMobi> while i dont use popups at all
[09:59:59] <toddparker> odd
[10:00:37] <toddparker> anyway, we'll test this today or tomorrow here at the lab
[10:00:42] <toddparker> man, you are thorough
[10:00:47] <toddparker> incredible
[10:00:47] <uGoMobi> yeah that would be great
[10:01:48] <uGoMobi> i think i need to remove fixed toolbars from test page... IE7 doesnt like that
[10:02:00] <toddparker> ok
[10:03:03] <uGoMobi> will check those things after weekly call so you can start testing

[10:54:46] <toddparker> thanks all for filling out that agenda
[10:54:49] <toddparker> 5 minutes
[10:55:22] <JasonDScott> Can you repost the agenda?
[10:56:24] <toddparker> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yAzrvogkEdnWl7v3I_rspXtU3mAgZh4cVoYmUssdKN0/edit#
[10:56:29] <toddparker> JasonDScott ^^
[10:56:35] <JasonDScott> Thanks
[10:56:41] <toddparker> we'll first meet on #jquery-meeting on IRC
[11:03:07] <gseguin> I started the hangout, feel free to join
[12:05:07] <gseguin> toddparker: it doesn't look like we need a g+ hangout follow up, do we?
[12:06:14] <gseguin> uGoMobi: how did you get that title: "uGoMobi wants Wilto to merge 3 commits into"
[12:06:38] <gseguin> oh I see, it's the assignee
[12:06:40] <uGoMobi> gseguin: where?
[12:06:46] <uGoMobi> oh yeah
[12:07:15] <gseguin> the title of the PR
[12:07:46] <uGoMobi> yeah i know what you mean... i wondered too when i saw my name there at another PR
[12:07:58] <uGoMobi> but i assigned myself
[12:09:52] <toddparker> i don't think so
[12:09:57] <toddparker> no G+ today
[12:10:05] <toddparker> that was actually pretty productive
[12:10:14] <toddparker> having bullets for each person up front helps
[12:10:25] <toddparker> now that we have 8 people, just doing a rundown takes an hour
[12:10:38] <toddparker> feel like we were able to talk pretty well tho
[12:11:16] <gseguin> yeah yeah, I don't feel like that needed one.
[12:11:17] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I think the essence of the matter is that we are all guaranteed to be available for that one hour.
[12:11:25] <uGoMobi> yes i agree
[12:11:41] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... and not so much the medium we use during that time.
[12:11:59] <uGoMobi> but it is pretty effective this way
[12:13:07] <uGoMobi> gseguin: are you looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4385 ?

[12:14:10] <toddparker> best thing is I can use the notes to write my updates
[12:21:52] <agcolom> Hi everyone again, sorry I was so slow to respond... My connection had dropped to 2Mbps! I'm back on 8 after 4 restarts!
[12:23:31] <agcolom> toddparker, will you meet Richard on monday? I could possibly join you then... if it is between 2pm and 5pm your time.
[12:25:46] <gseguin> uGoMobi: yeah that's the one I was looking at
[12:26:21] <uGoMobi> gseguin: sorry, i mean are you reviewing it?
[12:26:43] <gseguin> oh
[12:26:45] <uGoMobi> dont want to greenbutton it while you are looking into it ;)
[12:26:49] <uGoMobi> just checking
[12:27:15] <gseguin> I can take a look but I have no authority in CSS ;)
[12:27:53] <uGoMobi> toddparker just gave me that when he said he thinks it's ok to merge ;-)

[13:18:47] <toddparker> uGoMobi: so far so good on testing those button changes
[13:18:58] <toddparker> we have an intern spending hours using your test pages
[13:19:03] <uGoMobi> good to hear that
[13:19:06] <uGoMobi> hehe nice
[13:19:13] <toddparker> only one tiny regression that we can touch up after
[13:19:30] <uGoMobi> maybe we should have a standard test page like that
[13:19:41] <uGoMobi> containing all widgets and components
[13:19:42] <toddparker> in safari/Mac, the input width next to a slider is narrower than master
[13:19:50] <toddparker> only shows i character
[13:20:35] <toddparker> yeah, I was going to say that I'd like you to add these test pages to the docs somewhere and link them up so we can browse there and test
[13:20:41] <uGoMobi> hmm... strange because i didnt change anything to slider but will give that a look
[13:20:47] <toddparker> should be a permeant fixture
[13:21:18] <uGoMobi> but what do we use as source for js and css?
[13:22:03] <uGoMobi> or just so you can test a branch
[13:22:36] <uGoMobi> of course, wasn't thinking
[13:23:37] <toddparker> sorry, not sure what that last Q was about
[13:27:16] <uGoMobi> toddparker: forget about that Q, wasn't thinking
[13:35:10] <uGoMobi> toddparker: i see why the input next to slider is smaller... will fix that so it is same as master again
[13:37:23] <johnbender> jzaefferer: hey, I've got my grunt-junit plugin in a good spot
[13:37:34] <johnbender> just doing some final testing with jqm to make sure it behaves as expected
[13:37:52] <johnbender> if you're around let me know and we can talk about how it's set up
[13:38:02] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[13:38:05] <toddparker> looks like we can green button that pull so maybe you can patch this up after?
[13:38:08] <johnbender> that might be of interest to you guys at jive
[13:38:12] <toddparker> no need to re-do your pull
[13:38:19] <johnbender> dunno
[13:40:42] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes i can patch that after
[13:40:51] <uGoMobi> but i am still looking into that one error i get on select events unit test
[13:41:05] <toddparker> ok, thanks
[13:41:33] <toddparker> that error would probably stop us from just pulling this in. can't break the build
[13:42:00] <toddparker> but once i'm done testing, you can probably just make whatever changes are needed and land this in master
[13:42:08] <toddparker> and 1.1-stable i think
[13:43:50] <uGoMobi> yes i can still test with that branch on my forked repo and make changes in master later if needed
[13:46:56] <uGoMobi> johnbender: can you tell me what is the best way to test what the impact of a function is on performance?
[13:47:07] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/uGoMobi/jquery-mobile/commit/cb16e2f18639f531bf3347f08b3166f7f2ea7853
[13:47:07] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by uGoMobi (11h, 29m ago): Fixes #3301 - Full width forms.
[13:47:22] <johnbender> uGoMobi: you'll have to devise a performance test of some sort or another
[13:47:29] <johnbender> jsperf.com is a good way to go
[13:47:47] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[13:48:01] <uGoMobi> see last file of that commit
[13:48:43] <johnbender> uGoMobi: so, what I would do
[13:48:44] <uGoMobi> i am not sure if that slows down things
[13:48:54] <johnbender> since it's a $.fn method
[13:49:00] <johnbender> I'm sure it does in some fashion
[13:49:07] <johnbender> but it's good to know how badly
[13:49:09] <agcolom> toddparker??
[13:49:14] <johnbender> so I would set up a gigantic page
[13:49:24] <johnbender> with a bazillion forms and field contains
[13:49:45] <johnbender> and with jperf test how long it takes to enhance them
[13:50:05] <agcolom> guys, regarding this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4338
[13:50:06] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4338 on jquery-mobile (H2Os; 3w, 6d ago): Docs: $.mobile.fixedToolbars.show() and hide() still in docs
[13:50:11] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I would also add a comment as to what the nodetype 3 is there so that we don't have to go look it up
[13:50:14] <uGoMobi> and you can nail it down on a specific function with jsperf?
[13:50:26] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it's up to you to build the test to nail it down
[13:50:40] <johnbender> I mean in this case it's just the one .fn method
[13:50:42] <uGoMobi> ok i am going to try jsperf
[13:50:43] <johnbender> so that should be easy
[13:50:50] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah check it out
[13:50:56] <agcolom> is it best to remove and pull the PRs proposed, or is it best to keep the code in a big yellow box and say deprecated?
[13:50:59] <johnbender> it just makes setting up and running tests a lot easier
[13:51:04] <johnbender> and you can share the results
[13:51:31] <uGoMobi> cool
[13:52:38] <LakWork> what's the skinny on how jquery mobile handles 302 redirects?
[13:52:43] <LakWork> it seems to ignore them entirely
[13:53:56] <johnbender> LakWork: xhr1 objects don't work with redirects
[13:54:02] <johnbender> so jqm can't either :(
[13:54:18] <johnbender> last time I looked no one was using the second version
[13:54:22] <johnbender> "no one" being browsers
[13:54:31] <johnbender> the only workaround that i've heard of is a 208 or some such
[13:54:40] <johnbender> but we don't support that out of the box
[13:55:08] <johnbender> LakWork: not sure if that answers your question
[13:55:53] <toddparker> agcolom: my policy is to leave a yellow deprecated box in for a dot version, then remove it
[13:56:03] <toddparker> seems reasonable
[13:57:03] <LakWork> johnbender so then is it not valid for me to expect a 302 response to take the user to the location specified by the 302?
[13:57:18] <LakWork> i've been resorting to making all 302 type responses be non ajax
[13:57:26] <johnbender> correct
[13:57:27] <LakWork> which is shite if you ask me
[13:57:31] <johnbender> ajax redirects don't workj
[13:57:34] <LakWork> balls
[13:57:39] <johnbender> won't work for anyone yet
[13:57:43] <johnbender> jqm or otherwise
[13:57:57] <LakWork> i see
[14:02:05] <agcolom> toddparker, yes, this is my inclination as well. So we have a yellow deprecated box for now and remove for 1.2?
[14:02:50] <toddparker> yep
[14:03:31] <toddparker> might be worth adding a note on 302's on the ajax nav page under limitations
[14:03:38] <toddparker> there is a bullet list
[14:03:42] <toddparker> agcolom: maybe you could add that?
[14:03:49] <agcolom> ok, do I do all this now? (master is text removed and 1.1 is yellow box) or do we do 2 stages (yellow box in master and 1.1-stable for now) and when we release 1.2 we remove it?

[14:06:53] <agcolom> toddparker ^ (do you have some text for the 302 )
[14:09:19] <gseguin> and... back
[14:09:32] <gseguin> what 'd I miss?
[14:09:40] <gseguin> johnbender: 'sup?
[14:09:59] <johnbender> gseguin: at jzaefferer's urging I turned my junit output into a grunt plugin
[14:10:32] <gseguin> ok
[14:10:58] <gseguin> so it does phantomjs + junit ouptut, is that what it is?
[14:13:55] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[14:14:06] <gseguin> really cool
[14:14:08] <johnbender> gseguin: but it's a grunt plugin so you'd need to use grunt
[14:14:22] <johnbender> or you could just cargo cult the phantom.js file and the qunit inject
[14:14:23] <johnbender> lol

[14:30:22] <johnbender> gseguin: yessir
[14:31:22] <agcolom> uGoMobi yes down is ok
[14:31:53] <agcolom> but then it doesn't get the active
[14:33:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, but that has nothing to do with iPhone 4
[14:34:15] <uGoMobi> he made us believe it was an iPhone specific issue
[14:34:51] <agcolom> no, I get it on FF as well
[14:35:10] <uGoMobi> the button doesn't get active state because... there is no action
[14:35:13] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:35:25] <agcolom> Ah! of course :-)
[14:35:26] <uGoMobi> href="#"
[14:35:33] <uGoMobi> the other one is a function
[14:35:37] <agcolom> yes
[14:35:42] <uGoMobi> so there is an action for short while
[14:36:19] <uGoMobi> i don't see a bug in this behaviour
[14:36:55] <agcolom> yes, I would imagine this is normal as well.

[14:38:54] <uGoMobi> sure :-)
[14:39:41] <uGoMobi> and glad to read that tel link on iOS isn't a real issue... we just closed couple of those some time ago

[14:40:51] <agcolom> uGoMobil, yes, people have to realise that JQM is very strict and all tags must be closed, including the empty one!

[14:43:43] <toddparker> close, close, close!
[14:43:53] <toddparker> uGoMobi: good news, the buttons check out
[14:44:00] <toddparker> i'll post the full results soon
[14:44:06] <toddparker> but no major issues at all
[14:44:11] <toddparker> we just found 2-3 small things
[14:44:15] <uGoMobi> toddparker: great, thanks!
[14:44:32] <toddparker> great work. those test pages were incredibly helpful
[14:44:51] <toddparker> we have interns ready to thoroughly test things so let me know if you need us to run through stuff
[14:44:58] <uGoMobi> btw - that small input next to the slider shows that there are dependecies between widgets.... not good when we start with download builder
[14:45:03] <toddparker> zach here just spent 3-4+ hours testing
[14:45:11] <toddparker> hmm
[14:45:14] <uGoMobi> Thanks Zach!
[14:45:26] <toddparker> maybe we can tweak styles there to make them more standalone
[14:45:37] <toddparker> we really needed help testing
[14:46:43] <uGoMobi> we might need to move some css from widgets to core
[14:48:03] <uGoMobi> toddparker: thanks for all the testing and glad the test page is useful

[14:49:24] <toddparker> JasonDScott: this might be a good one for you to look at
[14:49:25] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4499
[14:49:26] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4499 on jquery-mobile (nightbook; 1m, 4s ago): Bottom accordion keeps rounded corners when expanded
[14:49:43] <toddparker> been seeing issues with collapsible rounding, seems like a regression
[14:50:13] <toddparker> uGoMobi: or duplicate css per widget to make sure they stand alone form other widgets
[14:50:22] <toddparker> slider should have input as a dependency
[14:50:35] <toddparker> what else is a dep there?
[14:50:49] <uGoMobi> thats the only one i just noticed
[14:51:13] <toddparker> can't wait to close all those issues with this PR
[14:51:22] <toddparker> we'll be very close to breaking under 400
[14:51:23] <uGoMobi> it just made me aware of that it is something that needs to be checked
[14:52:10] <uGoMobi> and many widgets depends on button.css but i guess that will be part of "core"

[15:03:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] agcolom pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/_r92IA
[15:03:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] moved incorrectly positioned dd - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[15:04:00] <johnbender> well it failed just as planned at least :D
[15:08:34] <uGoMobi> failed as planned  hmm :-)
[15:08:48] <johnbender> indeed
[15:10:19] <johnbender> solved
[15:11:39] <agcolom> uGoMobi sorry the down isn't there on the iPod Touch
[15:12:01] <agcolom> On FF it gets down but no active
[15:12:13] <agcolom> On Mobile Safari it get nothing at all....
[15:12:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ah ok... so it is an iOS issue
[15:12:26] <agcolom> yes
[15:12:45] <agcolom> just checking in the simulator now...
[15:13:35] <agcolom> the simulator also gives no visual feedback at all on the button
[15:13:42] <toddparker> i'm heading out for a bit
[15:13:51] <toddparker> but i'll post results to the PR uGoMobi
[15:13:56] <agcolom> bye toddparker
[15:14:05] <toddparker> think you can start landing that stuff now-ish
[15:14:10] <toddparker> bye agcolom
[15:15:12] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok cool
[15:15:15] <agcolom> I need to install/try adobe shadow... Would probably help find out what's going on with this button!
[15:15:37] <johnbender> agcolom: we can probably get you a license if that's not already sorted ot
[15:15:40] <johnbender> *out
[15:16:19] <agcolom> That'd be nice... Otherwise I have CS5.5 (and a license for CS6) is that under that or is it separate?
[15:16:53] <agcolom> (from work)
[15:17:45] <agcolom> (we are very good Adobe customers!)
[15:20:02] <uGoMobi> agcolom: can you test this version http://jsbin.com/aletuq/
[15:20:55] <uGoMobi> agcolom: oops... hang on ... forget that link
[15:21:28] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/aletuq/2/
[15:21:46] <uGoMobi> thats better :)
[15:22:14] <agcolom> ok... doing now...
[15:22:42] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[15:22:42] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #89: FIXED in 16 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/89/
[15:22:54] <agcolom> uGoMobi... It works :-)
[15:22:57] <johnbender> oh yah
[15:23:15] <uGoMobi> fixed as planned johnbender? ;-)
[15:23:20] <johnbender> indeed
[15:23:27] <johnbender> the failure was the warning generated by my plugin
[15:23:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok cool
[15:23:34] <johnbender> so it "worked" perfect!
[15:23:35] <johnbender> :D
[15:23:46] <uGoMobi> i love it when a plan comes together :)
[15:24:43] <agcolom> indeed! (Sorry used to watch this is French so I don't know the other phrases ;-) )
[15:24:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Anne, what I did is modified "hoverDelay"
[15:25:18] <uGoMobi> haha l'equipe A ?
[15:25:22] <agcolom> cool, yes I was just looking at what you did in the code
[15:25:40] <agcolom> Actually it was "l'agence tous risques"
[15:25:47] <agcolom> the all risk agency??
[15:25:49] <uGoMobi> haha
[15:26:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 3 new commits to master: http://git.io/AfcqlQ
[15:26:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Moved transition fallback modules into transitions folder - Ghislain Seguin
[15:26:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Renamed transition fallback modules into shorter filenames - Ghislain Seguin
[15:26:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed builder metadata as this should not even appear in the builder page - Ghislain Seguin
[15:26:49] <agcolom> what is the value of hoverDelay otherwise?
[15:26:57] <uGoMobi> 200
[15:27:08] <uGoMobi> so 0 is but extreme
[15:27:25] <uGoMobi> but maybe we have to give the default another look
[15:27:33] <uGoMobi> but = bit
[15:27:58] <agcolom> ok, interesting....
[15:28:42] <gseguin> uGoMobi, johnbender: question for you
[15:28:55] <gseguin> new directory: widgets
[15:28:58] <johnbender> shewt
[15:29:01] <gseguin> and widgets/forms
[15:29:03] <gseguin> ?
[15:29:18] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm into it, but one thing to keep in mind is jquery project conventions
[15:29:27] <johnbender> I never understood the jquery.mobile.foo.bar.js
[15:29:32] <johnbender> but that's how it's done
[15:29:38] <uGoMobi> i have a look
[15:29:50] <johnbender> in my little world I would have done foo/bar.js
[15:29:54] <johnbender> no jqm prefxi
[15:29:57] <johnbender> *prefix
[15:30:12] <gseguin> +1 for no prefix
[15:30:21] <johnbender> gseguin: also, if you're monkeying around with it, it might be nice to move the tag inserter into external
[15:30:39] <johnbender> gseguin: but we can't because that's the project convention I think
[15:30:42] <gseguin> ok
[15:30:52] <gseguin> oh really?
[15:30:55] <johnbender> gseguin: anything that isn't part of the lib I would take out of js/
[15:31:02] <johnbender> gseguin: that's the impression I'm under
[15:31:05] <johnbender> I could be wrong though
[15:31:12] <johnbender> let me look at UI
[15:31:27] <gseguin> what about jquery.js and jquery-*.js
[15:31:30] <johnbender> yah
[15:31:36] <johnbender> jquery core I think is split up actually
[15:31:37] <johnbender> hmm
[15:31:47] <johnbender> I would ask everyone about that though
[15:31:55] <johnbender> maybe save it until after the next release
[15:31:59] <gseguin> ok first thing first
[15:31:59] <johnbender> that's a big change
[15:32:05] <gseguin> prefix or no prefix
[15:32:12] <johnbender> gseguin: no prefix
[15:32:16] <gseguin> cause I already started getting rid of it
[15:32:23] <gseguin> so stop me now
[15:32:23] <johnbender> lol
[15:32:25] <johnbender> well
[15:32:31] <johnbender> I think we should wait
[15:32:52] <gseguin> I did events and transitions
[15:33:11] <johnbender> hrm
[15:33:49] <johnbender> so you did
[15:33:50] <johnbender> well
[15:33:51] <johnbender> fuck it
[15:33:54] <johnbender> I say go for it
[15:33:58] <johnbender> I'm going to kill all the old branches
[15:34:31] <gseguin> going once
[15:34:47] <uGoMobi> +1 no prefix
[15:35:02] <uGoMobi> +1 widgets and widgets/forms
[15:35:15] <johnbender> yah
[15:35:18] <johnbender> +1 to both
[15:35:27] <johnbender> gseguin: I would ask todd thuogh
[15:35:31] <johnbender> maybe I'm just paranoid
[15:36:26] <gseguin> toddparker: ping
[15:36:50] <gseguin> I need your blessing: ^
[15:37:20] <uGoMobi> todd is MIA
[15:37:33] <johnbender> I would do the work in a branch, I'm sure Todd's into it
[15:37:41] <johnbender> just wait until tomorrow to push
[15:38:29] <gseguin> l
[15:38:31] <gseguin> k
[15:46:27] <johnbender> old branches cleaned
[15:46:33] <johnbender> though I left a couple I wasn't totally sure on
[15:46:38] <johnbender> onward and upward
[15:46:46] <gseguin> code-reorg created
[15:46:54] <gseguin> not pushed yet
[15:47:18] <agcolom> ok, goodnight everyone :-) it's been so good to finally have a proper evening to spend on JQM and GitHub!!! I have missed it so much!!!!
[15:47:33] <johnbender> agcolom: thanks for all the hard work and have a nice night :D
[15:48:15] <gseguin> yeah thank you agcolom!
[15:48:32] <agcolom> please send us some someshine! This has been the most atrocious weather since record!
[15:48:46] <agcolom> I still have to put the heating on! And it's june!!!!!
[15:49:19] <agcolom> My pleasure :-) Goodnight again :-)
