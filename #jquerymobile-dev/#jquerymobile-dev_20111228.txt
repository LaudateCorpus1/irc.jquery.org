[13:43:02] <Wilto> why why why does a custom bezier function make animations smoother on android why
[13:43:32] <Wilto> nothing makes sense anymore
[13:43:42] <Wilto> there is no wilto there is only android now
[13:43:44] <gseguin> so it's all fixed ?
[13:44:11] <Wilto> Kinda. Despite the radical improvement to ICS with yesterday’s fixes, it was still pretty broken across the board.
[13:44:28] <Wilto> Any chance you have that ICS gadget within reach?
[13:44:35] <gseguin> yup
[13:44:45] <gseguin> same url?
[13:45:07] <Wilto> Yessir.
[13:45:17] <Wilto> So. The “hide” animation is still disabled.
[13:45:32] <Wilto> Pages sliding in from the right have today’s changes applies. Pages sliding in from the left do not.
[13:45:37] <Wilto> So that’s what you’ll want to compare.
[13:45:54] <Wilto> Figured that was the best way to do a quick visual one-to-one.
[13:47:44] <Wilto> So far on 2.2, 2.3, Fire, and 3.0 it’s much better. 3.0 is still flickery, but at least you can see that an animation is taking place.
[13:51:21] <gseguin> Wilto: uploading a video
[13:51:25] <Wilto> Sweeet.
[13:51:29] <Wilto> Lookin’ okay?
[13:51:33] <gseguin> yeah
[13:51:37] <gseguin> looking good
[13:51:40] <Wilto> Blinky?
[13:51:56] <gseguin> no
[13:52:14] <gseguin> but there is quite a lag between the tap and the animation
[13:52:29] <gseguin> http://vimeo.com/34306462
[13:53:54] <gseguin> sorry for the very shaky footage, I hope it doesn't make you sea sick
[13:53:59] <Wilto> Huh.
[13:54:02] <Wilto> And no address bar.
[13:54:16] <Wilto> I don’t even know why that’s happening, but I am okay with it.
[13:54:49] <gseguin> the adress bar is showing briefly after the reverse transition has completed
[13:55:17] <Wilto> Yeah, the reverse behavior is the same as it is on master.
[13:55:28] <Wilto> Interesting.
[13:56:56] <Wilto> gseguin: So… Between a custom bezier and adding scale(1), there’s a noticable difference. Some kind of hardware acceleration thing, or something?
[13:57:05] <Wilto> I’m just throwing CSS at the wall to see what sticks, at this point.
[13:58:39] <gseguin> I have no idea
[14:09:20] <Wilto> Don’t know; don’t need to know. As long as it works.

[14:42:55] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/slide-transition-experimental] After _considerable_ trial-and-error, this is the best I could manage to get slide transitions working across the Androids. Decent on 2.2, 2.3, and Fire, with only occasional blinking. A little smoother—though still not great and very blinky—on Xoom running 3.0. - Mat Marquis
[14:44:05] <Wilto> I give. I fold. I cannot improve the slide transition.
[14:45:15] <Wilto> Callin’ it a night; later on, man.
[14:45:22] <gseguin> alright
[14:45:38] <gseguin> have a good one
[14:45:51] <gseguin> sorry this is so frustrating
[14:47:11] <Wilto> Ah, no worries, man. It wouldn’t be any fun if it were easy, yeah?
[14:47:22] <gseguin> true
