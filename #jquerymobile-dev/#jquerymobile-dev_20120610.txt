[13:44:20] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] corrected default expanded icon (minus, not plus) [1.1.1] - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[14:16:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Anne are you here?
[14:19:14] <agcolom> Hi Jasper, yes I'm here
[14:19:43] <agcolom> uGoMobi? everything ok?
[14:19:54] <uGoMobi> hi Anne
[14:20:04] <uGoMobi> yes all fine, thanks
[14:20:06] <uGoMobi> you?
[14:20:20] <agcolom> yes, good, despite the rain!!
[14:20:39] <uGoMobi> we had a nice sunny day again
[14:21:13] <agcolom> Only the morning was nice here! This year has been really awful since April, weatherwise!
[14:21:18] <uGoMobi> sorry to hear the sun didn't reach London
[14:21:44] <agcolom> I saw your modification, the buttons on the docs look really nice. Thank you :-)
[14:21:45] <uGoMobi> yeah weather is a bit crazy here as well
[14:22:17] <uGoMobi> from storm and the coldest summer day in years to hot summer weather all in just a couple of days
[14:22:29] <uGoMobi> yeah that what i wanted to say
[14:22:42] <uGoMobi> i changed it so it is the same again
[14:22:54] <agcolom> Yes, I saw it this morning...
[14:23:09] <uGoMobi> now i still have an issue with Opera Mini but will discus that with Todd
[14:23:23] <agcolom> That's what I was going to ask you
[14:23:40] <agcolom> So what do you get with opera mini?
[14:24:36] <uGoMobi> when you combine buttons with text and without text in a controlgroup the icon-only ones are bigger
[14:25:28] <uGoMobi> or actually the issue is more that those with text are smaller because of Opera Mini's fixed font-size of 12px
[14:26:13] <uGoMobi> won't happen with mini buttons
[14:26:20] <agcolom> ok
[14:27:40] <uGoMobi> the samples on the button icons page are ok now too
[14:27:43] <uGoMobi> split them up
[14:28:05] <agcolom> yes, saw that too :-)
[14:28:31] <uGoMobi> i am still confused about all doc projects
[14:28:53] <agcolom> What is weird though is on FF it's like after a few, we get one extra pixel between the buttons....
[14:29:24] <uGoMobi> huh? on that page with button icon examples you mean?
[14:29:27] <agcolom> docs projects: YEs I thought there was 1 project, but actually there are 2
[14:29:47] <uGoMobi> are the current docs going to be replaced too?
[14:29:58] <uGoMobi> or just jquerymobile.com?
[14:30:14] <agcolom> yes that page, but I think it's a FF issue. Have been seeing it since the beginning, but not sure what is causing it....
[14:30:36] <agcolom> are the current docs going to be replaced too? -> I am not sure... I don't think so.
[14:30:43] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:30:58] <uGoMobi> checking on FF now
[14:31:03] <agcolom> I like the docs the way it is now, and I think we'll keep that but we need to clarify
[14:32:27] <agcolom> There is the docs for the jqm api which is all going to be in XML and trnasformed to html using XSLT. That's the one I'm working on, so I'm clear with this one. The other project, I don't really know...
[14:32:43] <uGoMobi> i see
[14:33:33] <uGoMobi> about that... i hope that content is going to be pulled in the JQM docs because i am not in favor of maintaining diverent versions of the docs
[14:35:04] <agcolom> Yes, we need to clarify that on thursday I suppose. I am not sure... Although the api docs is a cutdown version as it only covers widgets
[14:35:37] <uGoMobi> yes but there will be more and more widgets
[14:35:45] <agcolom> oh yes!
[14:36:06] <uGoMobi> and i am afraid that not everyone will think about updating those api docs too after updating something in the regular docs
[14:36:17] <agcolom> so maybe the idea would be to have the current docs with parts pulled in from the widget xml?
[14:36:42] <uGoMobi> yeah hope so
[14:37:01] <agcolom> just the xsl might be a nightmare to write!
[14:37:09] <agcolom> but not impossible ;-)
[14:37:14] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:37:25] <uGoMobi> to be honest... i dont know anything about it
[14:38:47] <agcolom> I quite like it... I've been teaching it for a few years and it is really powerful. But you need a clear head ;-) it can get pretty horrible ;-)
[14:39:09] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:39:53] <uGoMobi> i dont see extra pixels on FF
[14:40:11] <agcolom> and when you've been in it trying to do something for a few hours in the evening, you must read something (a book) to take your mind away form it or you'll be writing xslt in your dreams all night long!!!!
[14:40:12] <uGoMobi> did you still see them after the changes i made?
[14:40:19] <agcolom> yes
[14:40:31] <agcolom> let me check again
[14:40:35] <uGoMobi> haha dreaming xls ... exciting ;)
[14:41:46] <agcolom> oh no! Just spotted something wrong with the mini collapsible sets
[14:41:59] <uGoMobi> oh no
[14:42:00] <agcolom> ok: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0/docs/content/content-collapsible-set.html
[14:42:00] <uGoMobi> lol
[14:42:25] <agcolom> not ok: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-set.html
[14:42:31] <agcolom> look at the mini
[14:43:02] <agcolom> also in Safari
[14:43:12] <uGoMobi> i see it
[14:43:25] <uGoMobi> also know what causing it
[14:43:35] <agcolom> good ;-)
[14:43:52] <uGoMobi> grrr... like i said, you fix one thing, you create two new issues ;-)
[14:44:08] <agcolom> sorry ;-)
[14:45:00] <uGoMobi> no sorry... I am glad you see those things
[14:45:14] <agcolom> I am the testing queen ;-)
[14:45:37] <uGoMobi> haha... important role!!

[15:23:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: if you need to cherry-pick your commit into 1.1-stable you can just pick your own commit
[15:27:13] <agcolom> yes, but Ghislain didn't cherry pick his one, so I can't cherry-pick mine... I tried to contact him, but he was not online this weekend, so will try during the week.
[15:28:07] <uGoMobi> he changed something to the same file?
