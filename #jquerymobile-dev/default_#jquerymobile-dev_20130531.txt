[03:46:29] <danielvdende> Hi guys, I placed a forum topic here (http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-mobile-architecture-documentation) about creating architecture documentation for jquery mobile and Todd Parker directed me here. Are you interested in helping us out? We would be very interested to hear your opinions about the current architecture. We have some detailed questions that we would like to ask, but first we'd like to ascertain whethe
[03:55:37] <uGoMobi> hi danielvdende 
[03:55:54] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: I noticed your tweet a bit late, sorry
[03:56:21] <uGoMobi> good idea to post on the forum :)
[03:58:40] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: thanks for looking into JQM's architecture!
[04:03:26] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: and of course we want to help out
[04:03:29] <danielvdende> hi ugomobi, no problem, great to finally connect with the devs. Has anyone ever tried to document the architecture before?
[04:04:28] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: I am not sure, but I don't think so
[04:05:20] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: what would work for you guys? want us to look at your repo first?
[04:06:59] <danielvdende> uGoMobi: yeah, that sounds like a good idea. Actually, we're getting a repo ready for you right now :), since the assignment repo is private 
[04:07:14] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: ok great
[04:13:54] <danielvdende> uGoMobi: we copied all our files so far into a public repo at: https://github.com/danielvdende/jqmArchitecture. We have some freedom within the assignment, but obviously are obligated to produce certain documents for the assignment. This week we're working on the development view. It might be easiest if you take a look at what we have so far :). (and probably correct us if and where we're wrong)
[04:22:02] <uGoMobi> toddmparker johnbender_ _|Nix|_ arschmitz gseguin|away agcolom scottjehl_ JasonDScott___ ^^^
[04:22:16] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: nice work!
[04:23:53] <danielvd1nde> uGoMobi: thanks :). Any suggestions/comments/remarks/questions are very welcome :)
[04:25:23] <danielvd1nde> as an example, this week (as I mentioned earlier) we are working on a development view. As a part of this, we have to examine parts of the code that are re-used (i.e. certain ways of doing things that are used several times). Rather than us searching through the code ourselves (and probably getting it wrong), we thought we might be better to ask the experts (i.e. you).
[04:26:51] <uGoMobi> danielvd1nde: the thing is that we are doing a big refactor for 1.4 to improve performance
[04:27:06] <uGoMobi> I am working on this in branch "next"
[04:27:20] <uGoMobi> so a lot of things are changing as we speak
[04:28:02] <uGoMobi> for example almost every widget was calling our buttonMarkup function to style elements as buttons
[04:28:18] <danielvd1nde> uGoMobi: that is actually really interesting, as you might have seen in our metrics document, we actually intended to perform some measurements on code speed. Perhaps we could actually execute these metrics on the current stable build (1.3.1) and on the dev build that you are working on? (just an idea, might be a bad one)
[04:28:38] <uGoMobi> yeah, was just looking at that :)
[04:28:56] <danielvd1nde> uGoMobi: I ran into something with that function myself while coding with jqm :). 
[04:29:02] <uGoMobi> danielvd1nde: that would be great actually because we want a benchmark
[04:29:13] <uGoMobi> to see what are the benefits from all the changes
[04:30:01] <danielvd1nde> uGoMobi: exactly :). That's what we had in mind when we wrote that document, but obviously we had no idea the development was actually happening behind the scenes
[04:30:35] <uGoMobi> right
[04:31:30] <uGoMobi> currently we generate a lot of markup and do styling is often done by having the JS adding a class
[04:32:14] <uGoMobi> we are reducing that to absolute minimum... switched to CSS for theme inheritance and style native elements instead of generating markup
[04:32:38] <danielvd1nde> that should indeed improve performance right? (at least in theory)
[04:32:51] <uGoMobi> yeah addClass is expensive
[04:33:16] <uGoMobi> add we were calling getInheritedTheme() many times for theme inheritance
[04:33:28] <uGoMobi> http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/test/theming/
[04:33:46] <uGoMobi> danielvd1nde: if you inspect the code on that page you see the difference
[04:34:34] <danielvd1nde> sadly that link doesn't seem to work. Will be back in 5 min. have to relocate ;)
[04:34:41] <uGoMobi> we work on this in a branch because we don't want to have the master repo broken for a long time
[04:35:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping!
[04:40:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you around already?
[04:40:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up? Seasick?
[04:40:41] <uGoMobi> haha
[04:40:45] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[04:40:52] <uGoMobi> no I am all fine :)
[04:40:53] <_|Nix|_> :) Hey!
[04:41:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am working on the unit tests
[04:41:30] <danielvdende> uGoMobi: yes, ah the link works now :). We'll have a discussion with our professor how we can include this in our project, we're definitely interested in helping out.
[04:41:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we used to add the disabled class to the checkbox div wrapper
[04:42:04] <_|Nix|_> Right.
[04:42:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: probably same for select
[04:42:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in "next" the button inside the div gets the class
[04:43:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Q: should those class always be on the outer div? or can I just update the test to check the button
[04:43:19] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: great!
[04:43:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The test should reflect the expected state.
[04:43:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if it's correct as it is on master, the test should check for that.
[04:43:59] <_|Nix|_> I mean on next
[04:44:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well the question is more... what is correct?
[04:44:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, ui-state-disabled is supposed to affect the appearance of the widget.
[04:44:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: is it a convention that a widget outer element has those classes?
[04:45:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if you want to make sure that none of the widget gets any pointer events, then it's probably a good idea to place it on the outermost element.
[04:45:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: right, and it does... it's just that the class is the label element (the button)
[04:46:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, then I have to change the code, not the test
[04:46:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's fine. The label /is/ the outermost element, right? Our widget() function will return the label for the same reason.
[04:46:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wait a sec: If you place the class on the element inside the label, how do you make the label look disabled?
[04:46:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it should probably be on the same element as the one that is returned by widget() right?
[04:47:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: no, on the label element, there is no element inside the label
[04:48:07] <_|Nix|_> No? Isn't it <label><input type="checkbox"></input></label>?
[04:48:56] <_|Nix|_> I thought during checkboxradio's _create() we rearranged things like that.
[04:50:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm... looks like we did, but not anymore
[04:50:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/widgets/forms/form-disabled.php
[04:50:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: and master http://view.jquerymobile.com/master/demos/widgets/forms/form-disabled.php
[04:50:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, I see it. We grab the input and the label and wrap it in a div.
[04:51:17] <_|Nix|_> So, yeah, I guess the class should be on the div.
[04:51:31] <uGoMobi> okay
[04:51:52] <_|Nix|_> Although we do endeavour to get rid of wrappers. I suppose when/if we manage to get rid of the wrapper, we can apply the class as you do now.
[04:52:30] <_|Nix|_> It will be interesting to see what widget() will return in that case :)
[04:52:52] <_|Nix|_> ... probably the input, which is the default.
[04:52:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the reason that it's not on the wrapper anymore is because we let the widget factory handle it now
[04:53:13] <uGoMobi> and that is adding it to the label
[04:53:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  widget: function() { return this.label; }
[04:54:31] <uGoMobi> maybe I am the one who changed that :)
[04:54:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, that's probably a vestige from the time when the label /was/ the wrapper.
[04:54:56] <uGoMobi> yeah, could be... have to check the history
[04:55:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You should move the wrapper = document.createElement( "div" );... block above the $.extend and add wrapper to the list of variables inside $.extend.
[04:55:41] <_|Nix|_> You can then return this.wrapper from widget().
[04:55:47] <uGoMobi> I wanted to get rid of manually adding and removing disabled class to elements in the enable and disable methods
[04:55:55] <_|Nix|_> Yeah! +1
[04:56:02] <_|Nix|_> That's a widget review item.
[04:56:52] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_:  ok, let me see if I break anything if I make widget() return the wrapper
[04:57:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks!
[05:02:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: NP.
[05:03:50] <uGoMobi> wrapper is an object so can't toggle disabled class on it
[05:23:20] <_|Nix|_> What do you mean it's an object?
[05:23:25] <_|Nix|_> It's supposed to be a DOM element.
[05:23:59] <_|Nix|_> wrapper = document.createElement( "div" );...;$.extend( this, { ..., wrapper: wrapper, ... } );
[05:25:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: if I do that and change widget() to return this.wrapper you get an error can't toggleClass on object
[05:25:52] <_|Nix|_> OK ... weird ...
[05:25:54] <_|Nix|_> Lemme try it ...
[05:26:01] <_|Nix|_> Is this what you did? https://gist.github.com/gabrielschulhof/5684655
[05:26:17] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[05:26:45] <_|Nix|_> *scratch head*
[05:27:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: Morning all
[05:27:11] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: 
[05:27:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, sorry ... return $( this.wrapper ) :)
[05:27:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: toggleClass expects a jQuery object.
[05:27:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that's what I did too
[05:27:45] * _|Nix|_ slaps his forehead :)
[05:27:53] <uGoMobi> then the  error is gone
[05:28:02] <uGoMobi> but the class isn't added :/
[05:28:24] <uGoMobi> return this.label.parent() works
[05:28:29] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[05:30:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This is totally weird ... it's as if the original DOM element is not attached at all :/
[05:33:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: .wrapAll does something weird.
[05:33:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think .wrapAll clones the div we create.
[05:33:56] <uGoMobi> hmm
[05:35:26] <arschmitz> you guys having some sort of issue with wrapAll?
[05:36:48] <uGoMobi> maybe
[05:37:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: checkboxradio widget
[05:37:24] <arschmitz> have a link is it on master or next?
[05:37:27] <uGoMobi> wanted to change the widget() method
[05:37:33] <arschmitz> ok
[05:37:38] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: on "next"
[05:37:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If you pass a DOM element to wrapAll it seems to clone said element.
[05:38:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah
[05:38:48] <arschmitz> because you can use it to wrap a set of elements like do .find(".foo").wrapAll("<div");
[05:39:00] <arschmitz> so it clones it because it has to be able to be reused
[05:40:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Right, so there's no point it using document.createElement ...
[05:40:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so saving a refrence to it before wont get you anywhere because its just a ref to the unattached dom element not the element that ends up as the wrapper
[05:40:45] <arschmitz> nope not really
[05:40:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK.
[05:41:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess this.label.parent() will work for widget().
[05:41:12] <arschmitz> might be slightly faster then just passing a string but not enough to matter
[05:41:14] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:41:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am still not sure if this is the right way
[05:41:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it will add the class to the wrapper
[05:42:02] <arschmitz> still probably want to save a refrence rather then have it actually return this.label.parent() just for performance though
[05:42:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but will it still set disabled attr for the input?
[05:42:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's a separate task.
[05:42:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It won't.
[05:42:40] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's also part of the widget review.
[05:42:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it never does that on its own only sets class
[05:42:46] <uGoMobi> okay
[05:42:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz and I were talking about that.
[05:43:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess we need a general solution for <input>-based widgets, and soon.
[05:43:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm thinking maybe this should go into $.mobile.widget.
[05:43:50] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah could make a simple extension
[05:44:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: maybe but a LOT of our widgets are not form based
[05:44:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, I guess not.
[05:44:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i was thinking something small more like the reset one you made
[05:45:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: TBH, we could use a $.mobile.formwidget ... applying extensions is fine, but you have to explictly apply it for every widget. A proper class hierarchy /does/ make sense sometimes.
[05:45:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah actually i think that IS better
[05:45:47] <arschmitz> we could add in the reset stuff
[05:46:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's exactly what I ran into in web-ui-fw. There's reset, there's enable/disable, there's the wrapper creation/destruction, and the value stuff.
[05:46:35] <arschmitz> basicly take all the general input based stuff and throw it in there
[05:46:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: All specific to widgets which /may/ be based on an input.
[05:46:45] <uGoMobi> and select
[05:46:46] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[05:46:48] <arschmitz> and it makes the inheritance chain much more clear
[05:46:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[05:47:14] <danielvdende> uGoMobi: we discussed it with our professor, he is very enthusiastic. We are going to discuss the details with each other over the weekend and discuss our ideas with an expert on code metrics associated with our university. We'll be in touch to keep you informed on our progress :). Thanks! :)
[05:47:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... aaaand, $.mobile.formwidget could easily be an extension at the same time that it's a widget.
[05:47:35] <uGoMobi> danielvdende: that sounds great! thanks!
[05:47:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, you can tack it on to anything that ends up enhancing an input.
[05:47:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Cool! When do we do it?
[05:47:58] <arschmitz> so fromwidget will inherit from mobile widget and all input based widgets inherit from formwidget nice and consise 
[05:48:08] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. Exactly.
[05:48:35] <arschmitz> yeah +100 i think this is great
[05:48:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ : this sounds good
[05:49:19] <_|Nix|_> OK ... start work on "next"?
[05:49:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: did you see the jsbin i did for flip based on next?
[05:50:14] <arschmitz> tore out all those ios styles and used next
[05:50:19] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I saw it on my phone... didn't look at the code yet
[05:50:31] <uGoMobi> it looked great
[05:50:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i had to add a little js and back off css
[05:50:47] <uGoMobi> wouldn't mind if we speed up the animation a bit ;)
[05:51:10] <arschmitz> because otherwise we would not be able to modify the label text easily it would have to be overided in css 
[05:51:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats simple enough right now its just .4seconds i believe 
[05:51:41] <uGoMobi> I know, just saying :)
[05:51:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you have the link to that JS Bin handy?
[05:52:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so rather then add a single div it adds a div with 2 spans inside
[05:52:21] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/uzaret/814/edit
[05:52:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Mind if I merge in master and then do the $.mobile.formwidget thing?
[05:52:47] <arschmitz> not a huge difference really but allows a lot more flexibility in the widget
[05:52:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: arschmitz : BTW - wednesday before the Portland conf we have a team meeting day right?
[05:53:01] <_|Nix|_> That's right.
[05:53:02] <arschmitz> yup
[05:53:24] <arschmitz> moring is everyone afternoon is individual team meetings
[05:53:26] <_|Nix|_> Actually, come to think of it, I should probably do $.mobile.formwidget on master and /then/ merge it in, because I can check with the unit tests.
[05:53:31] <uGoMobi> is there an agenda for that day or can we just work on things together?
[05:54:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think thats the extent of it morning everyone afternoon teams
[05:54:11] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:54:14] <uGoMobi> nice
[05:54:31] <arschmitz> so in the afternoon as a team we can jam on whatever we want i think
[05:54:43] <uGoMobi> yeah great
[05:55:05] <arschmitz> be good to be able to get together even if only for a few hours lol
[05:55:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I am not sure what is best... all form widgets have changed a bit in "next"
[05:55:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know ... hmmm ... 
[05:56:08] <uGoMobi> I wouldn't mind if we merge next in master it's just that unit tests fail
[05:56:24] <arschmitz> sadly i think the best approach is to get unit tests fixed then start on it
[05:56:33] <arschmitz> because i think it would be best to do on next
[05:56:39] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I think so too ... let's make a devtask.
[05:56:45] <_|Nix|_> I'll make it.
[05:56:54] <arschmitz> but unit tests i think need to work before any js work is usefull on next really
[05:57:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i can probably find some time today and this weekend to work on unit tests

[05:58:43] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: cool
[05:58:52] <arschmitz> just pick a set of tests you want me to work on so im not working on same ones as you lol
[05:59:22] <uGoMobi> hmm there is a test to check if the input has the disabled attr after calling disabled method
[06:00:03] <uGoMobi> which is failing now
[06:00:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: for now i would just add someting like ...
[06:00:11] <uGoMobi> feels like waste of time to trying to fix that
[06:00:23] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15gabrielschulhof opened issue #6057: $.mobile.formwidget  02http://git.io/mTZc8g
[06:00:42] <arschmitz> disable: function(){ this._super(); input.attr(disabled, true); } 
[06:00:56] <_|Nix|_> .prop, not .attr.
[06:01:04] <arschmitz> yeah 
[06:01:06] <_|Nix|_> We want reset to keep working.
[06:01:13] <arschmitz> yup
[06:01:14] <uGoMobi> okay
[06:01:26] <arschmitz> thats real simple until the widget is ready
[06:01:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Actually, that's another thing the formwidget needs to handle: initially-disabled.
[06:01:41] <arschmitz> yup it will need to check on create
[06:02:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Added that to the new issue.
[06:03:20] <arschmitz> well probably not create actually but that idea
[06:03:28] <arschmitz> dont want to have to ALWAYS call super
[06:03:32] <arschmitz> that would be anoying
[06:03:41] <_|Nix|_> BBIAB ...
[06:04:07] <arschmitz> hmm so 
[06:04:20] <arschmitz> shoudnt $.mobile.widget be in the widgets folder lol
[06:04:39] <arschmitz> jquery.mobile.widget.js rather
[06:04:51] <arschmitz> it IS a widget
[06:08:03] <uGoMobi> ok problem solved
[06:08:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nice
[06:08:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: thanks for the help
[06:08:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem 
[06:15:27] <uGoMobi> browser cache is so annoying when working on fixing tests... even in incognito mode :/
[06:16:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i just keep inspector open to network tab
[06:16:21] <arschmitz> right click / clear browser cache
[06:16:38] <arschmitz> its the easiest fastest way i have found
[06:16:39] <uGoMobi> good idea
[06:17:44] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: incognito does not really help much with cache it keeps the cache until you close the tab
[06:18:03] <uGoMobi> ah ok... that explains it
[06:18:26] <arschmitz> if it didnt a lot of pages with cookies / session stuff would not work
[06:18:30] <arschmitz> and it would be super slow
[06:19:06] <arschmitz> a testing mode would be sweat where it ignores all cache
[06:19:35] <arschmitz> /sweat/sweet/
[06:27:02] <uGoMobi> yeah +100
[06:27:32] <uGoMobi> maybe ask paul_irish if this has been considered already

[06:28:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: good idea he would probably know
[06:54:03] <johnbender_> uGoMobi: danielvdende: I would characterize our refactoring work for 1.4 as performance focused
[06:54:23] <johnbender_> we talked about rolling that in if we had time but I haven't heard hide nor tail of anyone testing perf 
[06:54:31] <johnbender_> although it's possible I missed something
[06:54:36] <johnbender_> (very possible)
[06:55:35] <johnbender_> danielvdende as far as architecture is concerned I would definitely wait until after 1.4 since so much is changing
[06:56:07] <johnbender_> I think things will continue to evolve but 1.3 - 1.4 is a fairly sizable overhaul in terms of internals
[06:58:11] <johnbender_> uGoMobi: danielvdende: sorry, I *wouldn't* characterize our refactoring work for 1.4 as performance focused
[06:59:00] <johnbender> danielvdende: although I suppose it depends on how you define architecture
[06:59:12] <uGoMobi> johnbender: the changes in branch "next" are most of all to improve performance 
[06:59:29] <uGoMobi> johnbender: but I agree we have to test more
[07:00:34] <uGoMobi> looks like danielvdende isn't on the channel anymore BTW

[09:55:20] <mspisars> all, when is 1.4 rc or beta slated for?
[09:55:29] <arschmitz> 3-4 weeks
[09:55:53] <mspisars> ty
[09:55:53] <arschmitz> mspisars: so basicly end of june
[09:56:06] <arschmitz> mspisars: no problem
[09:56:14] <mspisars> yeah, that means about august we should have 1.4 cut?
[09:56:37] <mspisars> just trying to put some time frames for my projects
[09:56:39] <arschmitz> depends would like to think more end of july but that might be a bit over optimistic lol
[09:57:13] <arschmitz> work has been going really well though will be TONS of new and refactored stuff for 1.4
[09:57:18] <mspisars> 1.3.1 is serving me well at the moment, but I am loving what I see is being worked on
[09:57:38] <arschmitz> awesome good to hear 
[09:57:42] <mspisars> completely stand alone widgets are what I am after :)
[09:57:56] <arschmitz> awesome well that should be much easier with 1.4
[09:58:07] <mspisars> that's what I am hoping!
[09:58:41] <arschmitz> so are you just trying to use jqm widgets in a non jqm page?
[09:59:21] <arschmitz> just want to understand your exact use case so i can keep it in mind when we are refactoring
[09:59:52] <mspisars> in some cases that would be preferred
[10:00:25] <mspisars> but most of my cases are still standard within the context of a jqm page
[10:00:32] <arschmitz> ok
[10:00:43] <arschmitz> well the goal is to support both
[10:00:49] <mspisars> plus the widget abstraction will help with intergrating better with ember.js
[10:01:16] <arschmitz> also want to support using some of the big ones outside a page but still within the context of jqm
[10:01:19] <mspisars> cleaner, because the widgets will have consistent methods across all places
[10:01:32] <arschmitz> like toolbars / panels / popups that you may want to use on EVERY page
[10:01:49] <mspisars> exactly
[10:01:54] <mspisars> that would be awesome
[10:01:55] <arschmitz> you will now be able to just place them within the body 
[10:01:59] <arschmitz> and not in a page
[10:02:22] <mspisars> that is huge for supporting multi-page apps
[10:02:34] <arschmitz> the only cavet will be it will up to you to init and manage them
[10:02:34] <mspisars> it gets annoying duplicating panels per page
[10:02:46] <mspisars> i already do that :)
[10:02:48] <mspisars> with ember.
[10:02:57] <arschmitz> cool its also a performance thing
[10:03:10] <arschmitz> dont have to include them in the ajax request or reinit them on every page
[10:03:22] <mspisars> indeed
[10:04:09] <arschmitz> ok will i have to run right now but glad to hear your liking 1.3 and whats coming up for 1.4
[10:04:58] <mspisars> have a good one , thanks for jqm

[12:37:08] <toddmparker> ^ scott_gonzalez, uGoMobi, arschmitz 
[12:37:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: awesome
[12:37:23] <toddmparker> grunt icon literally works everywhere
[12:37:35] <uGoMobi> great
[12:37:43] <uGoMobi> you guys did a lot of testing!
[12:37:55] <arschmitz> nice tons of testing!
[12:38:01] <toddmparker> yep
[12:38:10] <toddmparker> wanted to be 100% before we used it for jQM
[12:38:21] <toddmparker> and to see if icon fonts would be workable
[12:38:49] <toddmparker> opera mini and WP7 are both no-go with fonts
[12:39:23] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah its too bad i like the idea of icon fonts better :/
[12:39:30] <arschmitz> oh well
[12:40:02] <toddmparker> it's more flexible for sure
[12:40:15] <toddmparker> but handling fallbacks is really hard
[12:40:22] <arschmitz> yup damn opera mini and WP
[12:40:33] <toddmparker> feature tests have a lot of false positives
[12:40:38] <uGoMobi> yeah you can't set anything font related in opera mini 
[12:40:53] <toddmparker> and you need to somehow generate pngs for fallbacks. with fonts, how to even do that?
[12:41:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah got me on that one lol
[12:41:17] <toddmparker> use phantom to somehow render out each font at the size/color it appears in the css?
[12:41:24] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: does WP7.8 work with core 2.0?
[12:41:34] <toddmparker> i can check
[12:41:38] <arschmitz> yeah its ie9
[12:41:40] <toddmparker> is master on 2.0?
[12:41:45] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes
[12:41:55] <toddmparker> ok, should be fine then
[12:42:00] <uGoMobi> do you still have those test devices
[12:42:11] <arschmitz> yeah its essentially ie9 so its supported
[12:42:13] <uGoMobi> HTC Mazaa
[12:42:48] <toddmparker> we're re-organizing the spreadsheet now
[12:43:10] <arschmitz> i wonder how cheap i can get something running windows 8 i really need to do some work with pointer events but dont have anything lol
[12:43:24] <toddmparker> arschmitz: i have a bunch of wp devices
[12:43:34] <uGoMobi> I bought a WP8 device, but if possible it would be nice if I have a 7.8 device for testing as well
[12:43:50] <toddmparker> if you want to come to boston and grab some. you can distribute them to others in portland, or
[12:43:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: 7.x though right?
[12:43:52] <uGoMobi> I got a Nokia Lumia 520 today
[12:44:02] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: return it!
[12:44:10] <toddmparker> unless it's your phone
[12:44:22] <toddmparker> we just got a few to distribute
[12:44:22] <uGoMobi> i just bought it
[12:44:28] <uGoMobi> needed a wp8 device to test
[12:44:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker: WP8?
[12:44:32] <toddmparker> yeah, most are on 7.5
[12:44:40] <toddmparker> and should be upgradable to 7.8
[12:44:41] <uGoMobi> I thought you had 7.8 HTC Mazaa there
[12:44:42] <toddmparker> but not 8
[12:44:45] <arschmitz> yeah i already have a maza 
[12:44:46] <uGoMobi> right
[12:45:01] <arschmitz> but need something with 8 for pointer events 7.8 im pretty sure does not have them
[12:45:09] <toddmparker> right
[12:45:12] <uGoMobi> so if I can use one of those HTC's I am covered as far as WP is concerned
[12:45:18] <toddmparker> annoying you can't upgrade
[12:45:26] <toddmparker> we have a surface rt
[12:45:31] <toddmparker> not sure if it's the same tho
[12:45:33] <arschmitz> i can probably come down and get others to distribute if people need though
[12:45:33] <uGoMobi> buying a BB 7 device as well
[12:45:44] <uGoMobi> you had some older BB 6 devices there right?
[12:45:48] <arschmitz> surface rt is the same as wp8 pretty much
[12:46:00] <toddmparker> arschmitz: if you can get here before PDX, I'll give you a bunch of phones to distrbute
[12:46:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: ok ill see if i can work something out.
[12:46:20] <toddmparker> i also go to maine on the weekends so we could meet up somewhere
[12:46:29] <toddmparker> i'm 30 minutes south of portland
[12:46:37] <arschmitz> toddmparker: are you going to be up this weekend or next? 
[12:46:43] <toddmparker> both
[12:46:50] <arschmitz> that would be awesome
[12:47:00] <arschmitz> its a LOT closer i could meet up with you either
[12:47:03] <toddmparker> i might need some time to go thru 'em
[12:47:05] <toddmparker> so maybe next
[12:47:09] <arschmitz> thats fine
[12:47:36] <arschmitz> toddmparker: did blackberry give you the ok to distribute any of the newer ones yet?
[12:47:50] <toddmparker> since they are being sold, i bet i can
[12:48:00] <toddmparker> i can check
[12:48:11] <arschmitz> nice that would be SUPER usefull for stuff on next and refactor
[12:48:20] <arschmitz> they are trying to push those pretty hard right now
[12:48:30] <toddmparker> think it won't be a problem
[12:48:48] <arschmitz> and they are pushing jqm apps too lol so be good if we could make sure stuff works ha ha
[12:49:48] <arschmitz> awesome we can figure out something to catch up next week when you come up
[12:50:14] <arschmitz> iv been trying to fill out stuff i dont have off craigstlist lately lol
[12:50:31] <arschmitz> got an android 2.2 phone for $20 last week
[12:50:39] <uGoMobi> good deal
[12:50:53] <arschmitz> yeah not the most usefull version but there was that issue on it last week
[12:51:04] <arschmitz> so i grabed to to test on actual device
[12:51:17] <toddmparker> nice
[12:51:27] <toddmparker> our 2.2 and 2.1 androids are dead
[12:51:34] <arschmitz> bummer
[12:51:36] <uGoMobi> 2.2 still has 1.7% share of all Adroid distributions
[12:51:48] <toddmparker> 2.1's battery swelled up and broke out of the phone
[12:51:51] <arschmitz> well if anything needs testing let me know i got one
[12:51:57] <arschmitz> oh i saw that one it was crazy
[12:52:01] <uGoMobi> aha the bio hazard story
[12:52:48] <arschmitz> need to find some android tablets found on on amazon brand new running 4.2 for $75 might grab it
[12:56:07] <toddmparker> dang
[12:56:20] <arschmitz> looks like the cheapest windows8 device is the dell xps tablet $300.00
