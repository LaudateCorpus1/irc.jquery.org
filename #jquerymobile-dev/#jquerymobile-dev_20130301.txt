[09:31:52] <toddmparker> hey all
[09:32:23] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: I commented here on the css preprocessor issue and invited the two people to hang out here and be involved - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/453#issuecomment-13787868
[09:33:10] <toddmparker> johnbender, gseguin, uGoMobi, _|Nix|_, arschmitz, agcolom - are you all around later today for a hangout re: 1.4?
[09:33:22] <toddmparker> I'm on vacation next week so I wouldn't mind doing a debrief
[09:33:29] <arschmitz> i can be what time?
[09:37:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: YEah, what time?
[09:38:15] <agcolom> possibly, depending on time...
[09:38:44] <toddmparker> when works for you all?
[09:39:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: For me the meeting should start within the next two hours, or I'll have to whisper :)
[09:39:18] <arschmitz> i have a hangout at 2:30 with scott and matt
[09:39:25] <arschmitz> and im gone for the next hour or so
[09:39:45] <toddmparker> maybe 3:30 or 4:00 EST?
[09:39:45] <agcolom> the earlier the better for me...
[09:40:00] <arschmitz> 3:30 or 4:30 both work for me
[09:40:01] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: OK. I'll whisper.
[09:40:10] <arschmitz> or 4:00 i mean
[09:40:44] <agcolom> I can't make that time (I'm picking up Alex & friend from a birthday party!), but I can catch up later
[09:41:11] <arschmitz> there should be a way to record a hangout
[09:41:33] <arschmitz> for people who cant make it lol
[09:43:07] <toddmparker> yeah, might be
[09:44:02] <arschmitz> ha you can
[09:44:23] <arschmitz> you just need to broadcast it and its saved to youtube
[09:45:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Nice!
[09:45:54] <arschmitz> http://www.google.com/+/learnmore/hangouts/onair.html
[10:06:30] <uGoMobi> hi all
[10:08:38] <uGoMobi> I got wi-fi again so I can join the hangout
[10:25:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: FYI - going to do a JQM + RWD talk on the Dutch Mobile Conference and they also asked me to do a 3 hour workshop
[10:32:55] <gseguin> YAY! I've got a first working version of the deploy via grunt
[10:42:34] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gseguin pushed 1 new commit to 06grunt-0.4: 02http://git.io/EUMHjA
[10:42:34] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06grunt-0.4 14b45797f 15Ghislain Seguin: Changed version to 1.4.0pre
[10:42:42] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: nice!
[10:42:53] <toddmparker> gseguin: great news
[10:43:02] <toddmparker> new grunt has a lot of changes, eh?
[10:47:22] <toddmparker> so when would work for a quick hangout? maybe in 2 hours?
[10:50:23] <gseguin> toddmparker: a few api changes that broke compat yes
[10:50:39] <toddmparker> we're updating some plugins internally too
[10:50:42] <gseguin> toddmparker: but also I got rid of all our shell scripts and Makefile
[10:50:56] <toddmparker> hey, it's a 0.x release
[10:51:01] <gseguin> toddmparker: the build is now 100% javascript
[10:51:03] <toddmparker> niiiice
[10:51:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: hangout at 4pm eastern time?
[10:51:24] <toddmparker> bet you never thought you'd say that
[10:51:29] <toddmparker> sure 4pm works for me
[10:51:31] <gseguin> toddmparker: I've got to catch up with the demos changes that went in last minute
[10:51:39] <gseguin> then I should be ready for a merge onto master
[10:51:44] <uGoMobi> nice gseguin 
[10:58:34] <gseguin> uGoMobi: did you guys get rid of the version string in the demos ?
[10:58:58] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I think we hardcoded it for the 1.3 release 
[10:59:07] <gseguin> hmm
[10:59:16] <gseguin> I don't see it
[10:59:30] <uGoMobi> it's in the footer
[10:59:47] <uGoMobi> and on the homepage in the heading
[11:00:05] <toddmparker> great news gseguin 
[11:00:08] <uGoMobi> we still have that JS script
[11:00:20] <uGoMobi> in jqm-demos.js
[11:00:23] <toddmparker> yeah the version thing was hacked in
[11:00:37] <gseguin> so something is up cause it's not there anymore
[11:00:38] <uGoMobi> to inject version from version.txt
[11:00:47] <gseguin> no more version.txt
[11:01:04] <gseguin> version now is in one and only one place: package.json
[11:01:20] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[11:01:36] <uGoMobi> gseguin: gnarf was asking about version the other day
[11:01:49] <gseguin> oh I must have missed that
[11:01:56] <gseguin> what was his question?
[11:01:57] <uGoMobi> because view is supposed to show the version when it is a tag
[11:02:11] <uGoMobi> but that doesn't work
[11:02:23] <uGoMobi> you get to see version dev
[11:02:33] <gseguin> OH! good you're talking about that, I forgot to add a tagging task
[11:03:30] <uGoMobi> so maybe you can look into that with gnarf
[11:03:31] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Can you also modify js:compile or equivalent to accept a parameter via an env variable and use it as the start file instead of js/jquery.mobile.js?
[11:03:54] <toddmparker> gseguin: sort of OT, but would the new setup make it easier to make the package.json files for the plugin site 
[11:04:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That's extremely useful for working with jsperf.com ...
[11:04:05] <toddmparker> we should have each widget plugin up there
[11:04:32] <gseguin> toddmparker: not there yet, that a separate issue I believe
[11:04:46] <toddmparker> for sure, just curious
[11:05:08] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I was thinking about modifying build/tasks/js.js to do that now, but I want to hold off until you merge.
[11:05:28] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I can add a requirejs target that takes an argument and build the module for that
[11:05:48] <gseguin> yeah 'cause most of that is gone now
[11:06:07] <gseguin> you can peek at grunt-0.4 and feedback is welcome
[11:12:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK.
[11:43:15] <gnarf> uGoMobi: look into what?
[11:43:39] <gnarf> i've been on/offline for a bit, think i missed whatever you were talking about
[11:43:55] <uGoMobi> gnarf: showing version instead of version dev when it is a tag
[11:43:59] <uGoMobi> on view
[11:44:30] <gnarf> i have a process now that runs a shell script whenever it updates something, but I don't know what it needs to run/update
[11:44:36] <gnarf> but yeah
[11:44:43] <gnarf> today is super stressful
[11:44:48] <gnarf> can't wait to be done with the travel
[11:45:00] <uGoMobi> you in Toronto?
[11:45:02] <gnarf> i was so stressed out that in the smoking room at ATL, I almost left my laptop behind
[11:45:16] <uGoMobi> geez
[11:45:20] <arschmitz> gnarf: Ah dont do that!
[11:45:29] <gnarf> well i did leave it behind
[11:45:34] <gnarf> i noticed i was missing it when i got to my gate
[11:45:39] <gnarf> it was still there
[11:45:46] <arschmitz> wow lucky it was still there!
[11:45:49] <uGoMobi> phew
[11:45:57] <gnarf> yeah, it was like a bar tho, so i think my waiter saw it when cleaning table
[11:46:10] <arschmitz> was it at least in a bag so not AS obvious?
[11:46:10] <gnarf> i tipped him again
[11:46:17] <gnarf> nope, i brought the bag with me
[11:46:21] <gnarf> forgot to put the laptop in it
[11:46:31] <gnarf> stress >.<
[11:46:34] <arschmitz> ouch
[11:46:36] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[11:46:47] <arschmitz> at least it was ok in the end
[11:46:48] <uGoMobi> take it easy gnarf
[11:47:57] <uGoMobi> and this version thing is something to look at after gseguin is done with grunt 0.4
[11:48:16] <uGoMobi> no rush

[12:37:48] <gseguin> ha
[12:37:56] <gseguin> so simple :D
[12:38:11] <gseguin> why wasn't that renamed demos?

[12:39:31] <uGoMobi> gseguin: we just wanted to be sure everything would work
[12:39:38] <gseguin> ok
[12:39:41] <uGoMobi> it was just before release
[12:40:20] <uGoMobi> but we should rename the folder
[12:40:35] <gseguin> uGoMobi: ok after the merge maybe
[12:40:51] <uGoMobi> have to a change to the zip build to then
[12:41:08] <uGoMobi> because I think you will get a folder demos inside folder demos
[12:41:33] <gseguin> johnbender: you sourced the phps with shell script or javascript?
[12:46:59] <johnbender> gseguin: ... I think you know the answer to that
[12:47:02] <johnbender> :P
[12:47:04] <johnbender> lolol
[12:47:09] <gseguin> :D
[12:47:18] <gseguin> what was I thinking?
[12:47:51] <johnbender> gseguin: there's actually an interesting little snippet using sed in there 
[12:48:10] <gseguin> oh I bet!
[12:48:23] <johnbender> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/build/bin/docs.sh#L60
[12:48:26] <johnbender> gseguin: ^
[12:48:47] <johnbender> gseguin: definitely not a long term solution but it was a relatively quick / easy hack
[12:49:18] <gseguin> I do approximately the same thing in JS
[12:58:35] <gseguin> johnbender, uGoMobi: so the real index.html needs to leave in dist/ not in dist/demos, right?
[12:58:54] <gseguin> (note: I've change compiled to dist)
[13:01:07] <uGoMobi> gseguin: right
[13:01:20] <gseguin> thanks
[13:01:24] <uGoMobi> gseguin: although I wonder if we still need that setup
[13:01:51] <gseguin> we can change it later 
[13:01:51] <uGoMobi> I think we did it to have the homepage at jquerymobile.com/test/
[13:01:59] <toddmparker> hi all
[13:02:02] <gseguin> I want to reach parity to be able to merge
[13:02:03] <toddmparker> hangout time?
[13:02:05] <gseguin> asap
[13:02:14] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:02:28] <uGoMobi> gseguin: yes, no need to change that now
[13:02:40] <gseguin> ta tata ta tu dam tu dam... can't touch this
[13:03:13] <gseguin> toddmparker: what's the meeting about?
[13:03:16] <toddmparker> whoever is around and wants to chat about 1.4 - https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/2af7602d8556e2c935fadf46516198b78eefacd3
[13:03:29] <gseguin> ok, I'll listen in
[13:04:42] <toddmparker> uGoMobi - you around?
[13:04:48] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:15:35] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15kmonsees opened issue #5723: Bars icon not working with latest version  02http://git.io/A0yk3Q
[14:33:21] <jlembeck> johnbender: you were right about Deferred, 140 lines, nice and short
[14:59:12] <gseguin> wow! you guys went PHP crazy on master!
[15:06:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: We were considering switching to SSI since the only PHP thing we use is "include".
[15:06:20] <gseguin> what's SSI ?
[15:06:29] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Server Side Includes
[15:06:44] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Basically, specially formatted HTML comments that the Web server replaces.
[15:07:05] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You can insert things like "Last modified" and you can include other files.
[15:07:26] <gseguin> is it supported by a lot of servers?
[15:07:44] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: No idea. Apache, for sure.
[15:09:36] <gseguin> uGoMobi: mind if I actually rename docs to demos now ?
[15:09:54] <gseguin> in my branch of course
[15:10:24] <gseguin> uGoMobi, _|Nix|_: are there demos you're actively working on?
[15:10:41] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'm not.
[16:03:00] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: why did we redirect from demos to / not the other way around?
[16:03:17] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[17:22:25] <jlembeck> _|Nix|_: gseguin|away: SSI is also on nginx, super simple stuff to setup too
[17:25:46] <johnbender> gseguin|away: no comment
[17:25:57] <johnbender> gseguin|away: that is, I don't know
[17:40:29] <gseguin> jlembeck: thanks! It looks like it's more likely to have SSI than PHP, isn't it?
[17:41:16] <jlembeck> yeah, it's built in the same way it is in Apache
[17:41:24] <jlembeck> quick and easy to use
[17:42:21] <jlembeck> The only problem I have, is I was reading about this the other day - http://projects.webappsec.org/w/page/13246964/SSI%20Injection
[17:42:35] <jlembeck> Old attack on SSI that is pretty easy to do if you're not careful with it
[17:43:12] <jlembeck> Since we're not taking any user input, we're likely good to go.
[17:53:58] <gseguin> jlembeck: and it's not really a risk as this is just our source that would be using it
[17:54:20] <gseguin> jlembeck: the compiled version would statically source all the includes
[17:54:31] <gseguin> the same way we do with PHP
[17:57:50] <jlembeck> oh nice, then yeah, no worries
[18:19:49] <gseguin> johnbender: what's your take on using SSI vs PHP?
[19:55:53] <RWhitbeck> hey you guys document the outcomes from that 1.4 meeting today?  Could use some of that insight for my talk tomorrow at jQuery TO tomorrow
[20:09:58] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't know much about ssi includes but both of them are technology dependent
[20:10:15] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: we're doing some house cleaning
[20:10:32] <gseguin> johnbender: actually I realized that we would still need PHP for combine
[20:10:37] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: research and brainstorming over the next few weeks on some things
[20:10:43] <gseguin> so we'll stick with PHP for now
[20:10:47] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[20:11:19] <RWhitbeck> thanks johnbender
[20:11:27] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: but the focus will some refactoring, perf testing, unit tests
[20:11:35] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: don't want to commit to much else
[20:11:56] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: no guarantees on the perf testing yet because I'm sure people will take that to mean "ZOMG IT WILL BE SO FAST"

[20:12:03] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[20:12:21] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: nothing yet that would be visible to users
[20:12:33] <RWhitbeck> ok so I'll sum it up like this
[20:12:36] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: there might be some under the covers stuff
[20:12:40] <RWhitbeck> Roadmap
[20:12:51] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: more like the navigate stuff we exposed in the last release
[20:13:15] <gseguin> only one thing missing from the deploy:release target is git tagging
[20:13:41] <RWhitbeck> currently planning on some house cleaning/refactoring, performance improvements, and unit test coverage.  While doing more research and brainstorming 
[20:13:55] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm sort of hesitant to do the git push as part of the deploy:target
[20:14:10] <gseguin> and I'm thinking of keeping it a manual step
[20:14:16] <gseguin> what do you think?
[20:14:18] <johnbender> RWhitbeck: that's fine and I would say calling it a roadmap is generous 
[20:14:28] <RWhitbeck> ok
[20:14:29] <johnbender> gseguin: agreed
[20:15:40] <gseguin> on to tagging then
[20:40:12] <gseguin> johnbender: when is it safe to merge grunt-0.4 to master?
[21:23:13] <johnbender> gseguin: you can probably do it now if you want
[21:23:25] <johnbender> gseguin: just be ready to deal with the builds breaking etc
[21:23:42] <johnbender> gseguin: or if you want to wait until Monday I can help out with that
