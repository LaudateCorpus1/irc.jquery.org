[09:43:56] <johnbender> alright!
[09:44:06] <johnbender> http://jsbin.com/edezef/9
[09:44:15] <johnbender> for those of you who have 2.2 devices and feel like a larke
[09:44:53] <johnbender> that will report orientationchanges (top number) and resizes (bottom number) in vanilla js
[09:44:58] <johnbender> *lark
[09:45:31] <johnbender> if you scroll the page at all it fires an orientationchange
[09:46:21] <johnbender> I've come to the conclusion that we should just use throttledresize by default and, in reporting the value, use window.orientation
[09:46:33] <johnbender> where it's available
[09:46:38] <johnbender> since that appears to be accurate
[09:47:33] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I *think* the reason you fell into that death loop was that the browser will fire another orientationchange when an alert is popped up
[09:47:47] <johnbender> thats what I was seeing at least
[09:48:11] <johnbender> once I switched it to reporting the values in the page the behaviour was at least a bit more sane
[10:03:03] <toddmparker_> johnbender: makes sense
[10:03:20] <toddmparker_> i'm not in the office today, but mat can test 2.2 (or whatever) if needed
[10:04:09] <toddmparker_> just gimme a shout (and a url)
[10:04:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kk
[10:04:38] <toddmparker_> i wnet thru all the new issues and triaged 'em
[10:04:48] <toddmparker_> so we're a bit better organzied for rc2
[10:04:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://jsbin.com/edezef/9
[10:05:29] <johnbender> it would be good to verify that weird things are happening on the device as well
[10:08:03] <toddmparker_> so how to read this test page?
[10:08:26] <toddmparker_> i see the numbers incrementing on orientation change, but what should it do?
[10:08:38] <johnbender> top is the count of orientationchanges
[10:08:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: bottom is resize events
[10:09:16] <toddmparker_> 0,0  >  2,4  >  3,6  > 4,8
[10:09:24] <toddmparker_> good/bad? iOS5
[10:09:43] <johnbender> that at least is sane/consistent
[10:09:54] <johnbender> the first number appears to be relatively arbitrary on 2.2
[10:10:20] <toddmparker_> gotta love it
[10:11:08] <johnbender> I think we're going to end up disabling the orientationchange binding
[10:11:12] <johnbender> in all cases
[10:11:56] <johnbender> though I think we can use window.orienation where it's available
[10:12:03] <johnbender> *orientation
[10:12:16] <johnbender> not sure what the point is though
[10:12:18] <johnbender> lol
[10:22:00] <Wilto> Gentlemen. I come bearing news from the North—of orientationchanges, and Androids!
[10:22:18] <johnbender> Wilto: I sincerely hope you're serious lol
[10:22:29] <Wilto> As serious as I get, sir.
[10:22:35] <Wilto> Android 2.2/2.3:
[10:22:35] <Wilto> 0,1
[10:22:35] <Wilto> 2,3
[10:22:35] <Wilto> 4,5
[10:22:40] <Wilto> iOS:
[10:22:40] <Wilto> 0,0
[10:22:40] <Wilto> 1,2
[10:22:40] <Wilto> 2,4
[10:22:40] <Wilto> 3,6
[10:22:44] <Wilto> http://jsbin.com/edezef/9
[10:23:04] <Wilto> Finding the 2.1 device now, but I have a hunch we’ll see the same. Also have 1.6 ready to go, if you want me to take a look.
[10:23:09] <johnbender> Wilto: 2.3 and 2.2 behave the same?
[10:23:13] <Wilto> Yessir.
[10:23:39] <johnbender> either way they appear to be triggering too often
[10:28:15] <Wilto> …Huh. 2.1 is weird.
[10:28:44] <Wilto> 0,0
[10:28:44] <Wilto> 0,1
[10:28:44] <Wilto> 0,2
[10:28:44] <Wilto> 0,3
[10:28:44] <Wilto> etc.
[10:30:58] <johnbender> sigh
[10:31:07] <johnbender> I think we just need to default to resize and call it a day
[10:31:46] <Wilto> Ah. I was flyin’ blind—hadn’t looked at the source yet.
[10:32:05] <Wilto> Less weird, then, the 2.1 thing.
[11:00:02] <jzaefferer> hey toddmparker_ toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2604
[11:00:03] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by jzaefferer (29.53s ago): Add swarminject.js to prepare for TestSwarm integration
[11:03:15] <Wilto> Whatup, Jörn.
[11:03:27] <jzaefferer> hey mat
[11:03:50] <jzaefferer> pull #2604?
[11:03:52] <jzaefferer> holy crap
[11:04:09] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I think its incremented with the issues :D
[11:04:14] <jzaefferer> oh
[11:04:16] <jzaefferer> that makes sense
[11:04:26] <jzaefferer> yeah, jquery and jquery-ui don't use Issues
[11:05:17] <jzaefferer> so yeah, as you're all here: that PR is the only thing blocking the TestSwarm integration right now
[11:52:43] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I'll merge in a minute (working with orientationchange)
[11:53:21] <jzaefferer> johnbender: I can merge, just need a confirmation that someone looked at it
[11:53:48] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I was just going to run the suite to make sure it didn't do anything untoward, but if you've already done that feel free
[11:55:48] <jzaefferer> running the composite one now
[11:57:31] <johnbender> jzaefferer: we have some finicky tests in event and one other but you'll know if something is wrong
[11:58:03] <jzaefferer> navigation takes a while...
[11:59:20] <johnbender> jzaefferer: :D
[11:59:25] <johnbender> uat
[11:59:40] <johnbender> we don't run the whole suite before each commit thats what the ci is for
[12:00:36] <jzaefferer> yeah...
[12:00:51] <jzaefferer> maybe there should be a seperate suite that you actually can run all the time?
[12:01:14] <jzaefferer> one failure on navigation/push-state-disabled-tests.html
[12:01:21] <jzaefferer> is that expected?
[12:01:43] <jzaefferer> wow, 6 minutes...
[12:05:25] <johnbender> jzaefferer: hmm
[12:06:25] <Wilto> Hey, can someone take a quick look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2606 and make sure it’s merge-able?
[12:06:25] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by Wilto (1m, 20s ago): Closes #518 — Custom selects now behave as expected within vertical/horizontal controlgroups.
[12:07:58] <johnbender> Wilto: that looks like on for todd of gseguin
[12:08:06] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah I would go ahead and merge
[12:09:25] <Wilto> Cool—thanks, johnbender.
[12:09:45] <johnbender> Wilto: my pleasure
[12:24:20] <kinblas> toddparker: so at MAX2 keynote Andre Charland from Nitobi/PhoneGap was showing off a few apps built with phonegap ... I think at least 3 were using jQuery Mobile :-)
[12:58:56] <johnbender> kinblas: yassir
[12:59:38] <kinblas> johnbender:  I guess you noticed too eh? :-)
[13:00:44] <johnbender> kinblas: indeed sir
[13:14:44] <jzaefferer> hey johnbender, I'm trying to fix the TestSwarm integration - looks like its failing due to an outdated QUnit "version" (we're gonna start versioning QUnit soon…)
[13:15:00] <jzaefferer> trying to update QUnit, I'm now seeing some testmarkup at the bottom of the buttonMarkup testsuite
[13:15:33] <jzaefferer> its not using #qunit-fixture, so I can't quite tell how its usually cleaned up or why it would be failing now
[13:16:06] <jzaefferer> I checked jquery.testHelper.js, but that doesn't seem to interact with QUnit enough to cause trouble
[13:17:08] <johnbender> jzaefferer: we manage the  DOM ourselves because we've have to reset browserstate completely if we reset the dom
[13:17:14] <johnbender> in most cases that is
[13:17:39] <jzaefferer> were is the code responsible for that?
[13:17:41] <johnbender> since there are a lot of dependencies created between things like the hash and the dom state
[13:17:50] <johnbender> jzaefferer: setup/teardown
[13:17:55] <johnbender> in most cases
[13:19:19] <jzaefferer> so on unit/buttonMarkup, there's no markup visible when I run it
[13:19:28] <jzaefferer> if I update to latest QUnit, there's visible markup
[13:19:56] <jzaefferer> there's no setup/teardown
[13:20:09] <johnbender> jzaefferer: we hide the pages elements in the qunit.css
[13:20:17] <jzaefferer> ugh
[13:20:39] <johnbender> ?
[13:20:46] <jzaefferer> okay, that's bad one way or the other, even if qunit would be versioned
[13:20:53] <jzaefferer> that needs to move somewhere else
[13:21:03] <johnbender> agreed
[13:21:21] <jzaefferer> well, I can put it back for now...
[13:21:49] <johnbender> jzaefferer: alternately we can just move it to another css file and include it in the test suite
[13:21:52] <jzaefferer> looks like that one block was the only change
[13:22:00] <jzaefferer> yeah, that makes more sense
[13:22:10] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah its like 2 selectors
[13:22:15] <johnbender> and I think one of them is redundant
[13:22:57] <jzaefferer> :p
[13:23:51] <jzaefferer> okay, there's more stuff breaking with that update
[13:24:02] <jzaefferer> looks like the event module breaks
[13:24:44] <johnbender> jzaefferer: does it break if you run it individually?
[13:36:07] <johnbender> jzaefferer: we have at least two legit failures in the test suite right now, I'm looking into why the CI isn't running ...
[13:42:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #99: STILL FAILING in 9.6 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/99/

[13:42:28] <johnbender> HERE COMES THE SPAM!
[13:42:58] <kinblas> heh
[13:43:09] <kinblas> johnbender: that checkin was a from a while ago
[13:45:31] <johnbender> kinblas: yes the restart on the ci wasn't graceful
[13:45:40] <johnbender> not super surprising
[13:46:02] <johnbender> might have been from the power outage
[13:46:16] * johnbender recalls some email mentioning something like that
[13:46:25] <kinblas> johnbender: so the 2 failures you mentioned
[13:46:32] * kinblas runs locally
[13:46:39] <kinblas> johnbender: what browser
[13:46:51] <johnbender> kinblas: chrome
[13:46:57] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm happy to take a look too
[13:47:36] <johnbender> kinblas: /tests/unit/navigation/push-state-disabled-tests.html
[13:47:55] <johnbender> kinblas: and /tests/unit/support/
[13:48:28] <kinblas> johnbender: i'll bet that's mine
[13:48:30] * kinblas checks
[13:48:48] <kinblas> johnbender: I think I was the last to add a test in nav
[13:49:16] <kinblas> it worked when I ran navigation/ but perhaps not in the full suite
[13:52:35] <johnbender> kinblas: it fails in the individual test as well
[14:01:31] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #100: ABORTED in 16 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/100/
[14:10:36] <jzaefferer> johnbender: also when running individually
[14:11:56] <kinblas> johnbender: so this is the test that's failing for you? jquery.mobile.navigation.js: query param link from a dialog to itself should be a not add another dialog
[14:12:49] <jzaefferer> actually the event module on its own fails, but the composite suite runs, even though it takes a very long time
[14:13:30] <jzaefferer> ah, because runner.js has a timeout
[14:13:48] <johnbender> kinblas: application url with dialogHashKey loads application's first page
[14:13:52] <jzaefferer> but that timeout doesn't make the suite fail
[14:14:10] <johnbender> jzaefferer: hmm thats not good
[14:14:47] <jzaefferer> onTimeout: QUnit.start
[14:14:53] <jzaefferer> not a good strategy
[14:15:30] <jzaefferer> anyway, the event module on its own fails, just stops running
[14:15:34] <jzaefferer> after finishing the first test
[14:16:15] <jzaefferer> that reloadLib stuff looks sketchy
[14:16:35] <johnbender> jzaefferer: it is indeed
[14:16:43] <johnbender> those tests are SUPER finicky
[14:16:46] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #101: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/101/
[14:17:17] <johnbender> kinblas: those two failures are the ones failing in CI as well
[14:17:41] <jzaefferer> looks like the "defined event functions bind a closure when passed" test on the one after that are at fault
[14:18:21] <Wilto> Hey johnbender, is there still talk of doing some kind of git training session for frequent committers?
[14:18:46] <Wilto> I know toddparker mentioned something about it not too long ago.
[14:19:15] <Wilto> I’ve been gittin’ for a while now, but this whole “new branch, rebase, pull request” workflow is tripping me up.
[14:19:21] <johnbender> Wilto post 1.0 I'm going to try and do 15 minutes on using rebase so we can avoid some of the merge issues we run into
[14:19:44] <Wilto> Sweet. Sign me up.
[14:19:46] <kinblas> johnbender: Wilto: yeah I'd be interested ... what I want to know is a good way to merge back in after you've been on a branch for a while, but have it do something like a rebase
[14:20:29] <johnbender> kinblas: so the answer is generally wait until its time to merge to rebase
[14:20:59] <johnbender> but a lot of times, as we've discussed the rebase just gets ugly and you just need to merge
[14:21:11] <johnbender> long lived branches can be really rebase unfriendly
[14:22:01] <jzaefferer> johnbender Wilto: once a branch is published, you shouldn't rebase; for any branch, make sure that you keep it up to date, that is, merge master into your branch at least once a week
[14:23:41] <johnbender> jzaefferer: right but time isn't always the proper measure for "don't rebase"
[14:23:52] <johnbender> if its long lived but 3 commits its just fine to rebase 3 weeks later before merging
[14:24:00] <johnbender> if you've never rebased before
[14:24:07] <jzaefferer> if you published it, you shouldn't rebase
[14:24:08] <johnbender> that way your merge into master is a fast forward
[14:24:11] <jzaefferer> that's a good rule of thumb
[14:24:27] <jzaefferer> do you have any actual problems with merge commits?
[14:24:28] <johnbender> jzaefferer: well it won't let you unless you force push
[14:24:35] <johnbender> which would explode the universe
[14:24:55] <Wilto> So, johnbender, if you don’t mind me picking your brain for a second?
[14:24:55] <johnbender> since history would be effectively changed and everyone's trees would be invalid
[14:25:06] <johnbender> Wilto: shoot
[14:25:11] <Wilto> Say I have this *friend* who kind of sucks at git:
[14:25:14] <jzaefferer> btw. found the issue in the event module - was using both asyncTest() and stop()
[14:25:28] <johnbender> jzaefferer: merge commits if they are big and ugly can ruin any chance at doing an effective bisect for example
[14:25:40] <johnbender> Wilto: lol awesome
[14:26:03] <johnbender> jzaefferer: rebase is a better workflow for preserving a history you can understand
[14:26:06] <jzaefferer> johnbender: really? didn't use bisect more then a few times, but merge commits never were a problem there
[14:26:13] <johnbender> jzaefferer: they certainly can be
[14:26:14] <Wilto> So, he’s on his repo’s master. Creates a branch for a bug, fixes said bug, rebases, pushes.
[14:26:18] <johnbender> jzaefferer: especially if they are big
[14:26:33] <Wilto> Create a pull request, and it says “you’re asking to pull 11 commits into…”
[14:26:47] <Wilto> But uh, all those commits are already in the project’s master.
[14:26:54] <Wilto> Save one, the fixed bug.
[14:26:59] <jzaefferer> Wilto: how do you rebase, and how do you create the PR?
[14:27:19] <kinblas> johnbender: I guess what I hate about being out on a branch is that when I push ... it's actually hard to see what actually go changed when I land because the dates of the individual checkins get mixed in with other HEAD checkins on the date I commited them on the branch
[14:27:22] <Wilto> “Create the PR?”
[14:27:42] <jzaefferer> step-by-step :-)
[14:27:48] <johnbender> jzaefferer: in the case of a merge?
[14:27:55] <johnbender> jzaefferer: wrong person
[14:28:00] <johnbender> kinblas: in the case of a merge?
[14:28:30] <johnbender> kinblas: right so the other advantage of a rebase is that it replays your commits on top of whatever you're rebasing onto, so its as though you just made those commits
[14:28:33] <johnbender> again
[14:28:37] <johnbender> easier to reason about
[14:28:45] <johnbender> it creates a linear, understandable, history of change in the proejct
[14:28:51] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah ... following the rule of not rebasing what is public ... sometimes we push branches so we can show you or scott something, but you guys don't necessarily care or do work on that branch
[14:29:02] <johnbender> if you do a git log --graph on our project you'll brain will explode
[14:29:10] <Wilto> Well, I suppose I don’t know how I need to do the rebase itself, jzaefferer. I mean… I assume it’s supposed to rebase from an up-to-date master, yeah?
[14:29:31] <johnbender> *your brain
[14:29:31] <Wilto> Which I am keeping updated, prior to creating the branch.
[14:29:56] <kinblas> johnbender: anyways, if there is a little session, I'd like to cover that scenario
[14:29:57] <johnbender> kinblas: thats why I push to me personal repo
[14:30:20] <kinblas> johnbender: ok if that's a good workflow to end up with all my changes on top of HEAD when I land then I'd like to learn it
[14:30:24] <johnbender> kinblas: but for the most part you'll just need to merge after that
[14:30:27] <johnbender> you've made it public
[14:30:39] <johnbender> kinblas: thats exactly what rebase is for
[14:31:08] <johnbender> Wilto: yah its hard to know why its adding in extra commits etc unless we know what commands you're using
[14:31:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #102: STILL FAILING in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/102/
[14:31:32] <jqm-jenkins-bot> mat: Fixes #2594 — Button text is no longer read aloud twice (and treated as two separate navigable items) in iOS VoiceOver.
[14:31:42] <Wilto> Hey, at least that one worked.
[14:32:19] <kinblas> johnbender: right I know what rebase is for, but I've tried unsuccessfully in the past to use it on a branch I've been on that has had several merges of HEAD along the way
[14:32:52] <kinblas> johnbender: remember I sometimes take on things that take weeks to complete, all the while the HEAD is changing/evolving, so I need to periodically suck in the HEAD to make sure I stay in sync somewhat
[14:34:39] <johnbender> kinblas: as long as the branch is local thats fine you can continue to rebase onto master to get the updates
[14:34:50] <johnbender> and as long as the content change isn't enormous
[14:34:53] <gseguin> johnbender: when are you planning to school us on git? have you set a date?
[14:34:59] <johnbender> if it starts to get big then you'll probably just want to merge
[14:35:11] <toddmparker_> kinblas: do you know when in the keynote today they demo'd themeroller?
[14:35:16] <toddmparker_> very exciting
[14:35:17] <johnbender> gseguin: lets not get crazy here I'm only passing on what little knowledge I've scraped together over time
[14:35:40] <johnbender> but probably post 1.0
[14:35:44] <kinblas> toddmparker: ugh it's during Paul Gubbay's turn .. probably about 30 minutes in?
[14:35:46] <gseguin> johnbender: that's probably worth sharing
[14:36:03] <kinblas> toddmparker: the ugh was regarding the feed today .. it sucks, keeps dropping
[14:36:08] <johnbender> that was the concensus with scottjehl and toddmparker_
[14:36:12] <kinblas> makes watching hard
[14:36:20] * johnbender agrees with kinblas 
[14:36:45] <kinblas> toddmparker: took me about 3 loops to watch the whole thing
[14:37:12] <kinblas> toddparker_: and you can't fast-forward/rewind
[14:37:23] <kinblas> you will be able to tomorrow though
[14:38:57] <johnbender> jzaefferer: are you running into huge roadblocks with setting the test suite up?
[14:39:16] <johnbender> if you are maybe it would be better to wait until I have some time to help out post 1.0
[14:48:54] <jzaefferer> johnbender: nope, got it in place now
[14:48:56] <jzaefferer> see http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile/
[14:49:01] <jzaefferer> and http://swarm.jquery.org/user/jquerymobile/
[14:49:30] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I owe you many beers
[14:49:48] <jzaefferer> Scott is still talking with browserscope to provide us with clients
[14:50:02] * johnbender dances a jig.
[14:50:11] <johnbender> jzaefferer: thanks so much for diving in to do that man
[14:51:33] <Wilto> Okay. To get my bearings, I’m just working in “master” right now.
[14:51:53] <Wilto> I hit “pull request,” it asks if I want to pull in eleven commits—all of which are already in the project master.
[14:51:55] <Wilto> w:jquery-mobile wilto$ git fetch upstream
[14:51:55] <Wilto> w:jquery-mobile wilto$ git merge upstream/master
[14:51:55] <Wilto> Already up-to-date.
[14:52:03] <Wilto> What the hell?
[14:52:15] <jzaefferer> Wilto: switch to your branch
[14:52:20] <jzaefferer> then use the PR button
[14:52:29] <Wilto> I was getting the same.
[14:53:04] <Wilto> I just deleted the branch, but if I start a new one with whatever the hell is happening on master, it’s gonna include those 11 commits.
[14:53:25] <Wilto> Some of them are from yesterday—why is this happening now, and not with the pull request I sent earlier today?
[14:53:56] <johnbender> Wilto which branch is it?
[14:54:33] <Wilto> johnbender: I’m on my master, now. Just trying to get that sync’d up, first and foremost.
[14:54:54] <johnbender> Wilto: I was just about to say, go rebase your master first
[14:54:57] <johnbender> should be fast forward
[14:55:28] <Wilto> I hate computers, you guys.
[14:55:39] <Wilto> This is why I never touch the things.
[14:55:46] <johnbender> lol
[15:03:36] <Wilto> Heeey, “Commits: 1!”
[15:03:55] <johnbender> Wilto: after rebasing your local master?
[15:04:10] <johnbender> err "updating" your local master?
[15:04:11] <Wilto> That only took me like two hours, to contribute maybe twenty characters of code!
[15:04:25] <Wilto> ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED: Maybe Consider a Career In Automotive Repair!
[15:04:36] <johnbender> lol
[15:06:17] <Wilto> Rebase master, delete bugfix branch, “git reset --hard [commit from yesterday]”, “fetch upstream”, “merge upstream/master”, create a new branch for the bug, fix it, and voilá.
[15:06:39] <Wilto> SO SIMPLE.
[15:08:19] <Wilto> And on that note, I’m leaving before I accidentally set my computer on fire. Thanks for the help, guys.
[15:08:48] <Wilto> (“Accidentally.”)
[15:13:10] <johnbender> so I'm working on the xss via .text issue
[15:13:48] <johnbender> kinblas: scottjehl: I can't seem to get it to execute a script when doing the necessary kartwheels/backflips in an attribute assignment
[15:13:53] <johnbender> but I'm warry to just give it a pass
[15:14:36] <kinblas> johnbender: what's the issue #?
[15:14:53] <kinblas> johnbender: did you fix that navigation unit test bustage?
[15:14:58] <kinblas> It's not happening for me now
[15:15:06] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2550
[15:15:06] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2550 on jquery-mobile, reported by johnbender (6d, 23h ago): Insertion of decoded html from `.text()` during enhancement.
[15:15:07] <johnbender> kinblas: no
[15:15:14] <johnbender> that won't be much help
[15:15:27] <johnbender> the specific instance is in the button markup plugin
[15:15:32] <kinblas> johnbender: I thought you fixed that one
[15:15:42] <johnbender> you can just search for .text
[15:15:49] <johnbender> kinblas: for the select menu I did
[15:15:57] <johnbender> not for the other occurences
[15:16:11] <johnbender> thats what I'm doing now
[15:16:24] <johnbender> and i was writting a test for this one but I'm unable toget it to excute the script
[15:16:39] <johnbender> I'm just wondering if thats a function of my lack of cleverness or that its not actually an issue
[15:17:26] <kinblas> johnbender: for a button I think you have to set the value to something like
[15:17:42] <kinblas> johnbender: wait is this for input type=button?
[15:18:31] <johnbender> kinblas: the selector at the bottom of buttonMarkup includes a whole host of things
[15:18:36] <johnbender> I just made a link in a header
[15:18:42] <kinblas> oh ok buttonMarkup
[15:18:47] <kinblas> so it's a link that's being converted
[15:19:08] <johnbender> for my test case at leat
[15:19:22] <johnbender> but for any element that falls into that selector and data-iconpos="notext"
[15:21:18] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #103: STILL FAILING in 15 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/103/
[15:21:19] <jqm-jenkins-bot> joern.zaefferer: Update to latest QUnit. Fix event tests that were calling both asyncTest
[15:27:32] <johnbender> kinblas: anyway, the text is placed inside a quoted attribute so it doesn't appear to matter
[15:31:40] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm tempted to do it as a safe default and remove them when someone says thats unecessary
[15:40:00] <johnbender> kinblas: so does setAttribute handle this in browsers
[15:44:05] <kinblas> johnbender: I think it depends on how you extract the attribute value, whether through getAttribute() or through a property on the element that corresponds to the attribute
[15:44:41] <johnbender> kinblas: so we do actually have to worry abotu the value thats being passed in
[15:45:15] <johnbender> kinblas: you're saying that the storage of the value will be different in those two cases?
[15:45:22] <johnbender> expando or getAttr?
[15:45:31] * johnbender is tempted to commit and push
[15:48:05] <kinblas> johnbender: the storage may not be different, but the method of extracting a value from an attribute or property may
[15:48:21] <kinblas> for example if you ask an <a> for its href (a.href) it gives you an absolute path
[15:48:22] <johnbender> kinblas: in these cases its coming from text so I'd have to look
[15:48:41] <kinblas> wasn't the original problem where we extracted the value of an option
[15:48:47] <johnbender> but what you're saying is that setAttribute doesn't do anything special then
[15:48:54] <kinblas> and because we are injetcing the textual value into a fake button
[15:48:58] <johnbender> yes
[15:49:30] <kinblas> it's in how you *extract* the value
[15:49:42] <kinblas> getAttribute() versus obj.attr
[15:49:59] <johnbender> kinblas: if it depends on how the original value was retrieved then doesn't that imply that setAttr doesn't do anything in terms of checking/encoding?
[15:54:38] <johnbender> kinblas: alright this fix needs to go in, I'm going to leave it encoded and if we decide to take it out later thats fine
[15:55:02] <johnbender> its been sitting a in a branch for a good long while now
[15:55:45] <kinblas> johnbender: sorry I've got 3 convos going at the same time
[15:55:50] * kinblas feels like a scatter brain
[15:56:09] <johnbender> kinblas: not at all
[15:56:16] <johnbender> I think I'm too worried about this
[15:56:17] <johnbender> we'll be fine
[15:56:18] <kinblas> johnbender: i'd have to do a few tests to give you a defnitive answer on the attribute get/set
[15:56:35] <kinblas> but from my recollection I thought the set/get was pretty hands-off
[15:57:15] <kinblas> johnbender: the one thing you don't want is to have &amp; or &gt; showing up in labels
[15:57:24] <kinblas> I mean literally &amp;
[15:57:35] <kinblas> &amp;amp;
[15:58:13] <johnbender> kinblas: hmm let me check
[16:00:59] <kinblas> johnbender: anyways regarding button markup
[16:01:15] <kinblas> I think it only wraps stuff so they never really extract attribute values
[16:01:23] <kinblas> the values are already in the markup
[16:01:31] <kinblas> ... like inside the < a >
[16:01:38] <kinblas> <a> .. </a>
[16:10:16] <johnbender> kinblas: this is clearly more complex than that solution we have in place is going to handle
[16:10:38] <johnbender> kinblas: our getEncodedText is not special character friendly
