[08:27:24] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Are there overwhelming reasons why the default action of _setOption( "disabled", ... ) does not include .prop( "disabled", !!value ) if this.element is a form element?
[08:28:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... at first glance it seems like it would be good to sync the disabled state of the native element with that of the widget if the widget is based on an element that understands the concept of "disabled".
[08:31:37] <scott_gonzalez> Nothing overwhelming. Doing things in the default _setOption() hasn't turned out to be too great.
[08:32:03] <scott_gonzalez> Also, every time we put something there, we have to add it to the default init.
[08:37:56] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: Hi Scott, We have a tiny number of blocks of code in the minutes, and currently those look pretty ugly... Does that matter or do we leave this as is? (in other words, can we make this look better with minimal effort?) example: http://meetings.jquery.org/2012-05-24-mobile/
[08:40:09] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: We should be able to fix that.
[08:40:20] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[08:40:23] <scott_gonzalez> Looks like this isn't getting run through the proper functions.
[08:40:44] <agcolom> ok
[08:41:36] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, right, I remember what happened.
[08:41:49] <agcolom> yes?
[08:42:25] <scott_gonzalez> rworth created a custom grunt task and didn't get all the parts of the normal process.
[08:42:47] <scott_gonzalez> We talked about the proper way to do it, but never went back to fix it.
[08:43:05] <agcolom> oh I see... Yes, I guess normally code doesn't make it to minutes... 
[08:43:42] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/grunt-jquery-content/issues/35
[08:43:52] <agcolom> I still have to fix the formatting of a few more and we should be ok
[08:44:48] <agcolom> Sorry for the ton of emails you must have received this weekend ;-) 
[08:45:37] <scott_gonzalez> I'd rather have lots of emails and things getting done than no emails and work stagnating :-)
[08:45:53] <agcolom> Good ;-)
[09:28:12] <agcolom> If gnarf is around.... HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!!
[09:28:34] <gnarf> i am
[09:28:37] <gnarf> and thanks :)
[09:28:44] <agcolom> you're very welcome :-)
[10:18:17] <agcolom> toddmparker: all minutes have been ported... are any missing? seems like there a gap between late 2011 and early 2012

[22:14:45] <monster> Hi there!
[22:15:08] <monster> I have been writing some jQuery Mobile apps lately, and from my experience I have
[22:15:33] <monster> bundled together a couple of projects in a kind of jumpstart
[22:15:39] <monster> I would love to have some feedback
[22:15:42] <monster> it is at: https://github.com/Golodhros/jquery-mobile-require-less
[22:16:01] <monster> Thanks!
