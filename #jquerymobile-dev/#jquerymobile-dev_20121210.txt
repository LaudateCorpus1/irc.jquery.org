[05:16:00] <arschmitz> morning _|Nix|_: uGoMobi_:
[05:16:13] <uGoMobi_> morning arschmitz 
[05:23:30] <arschmitz> so did some awesome work on range this weekend
[05:24:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: droped 1/4 of the code and made it MUCH more simple and reliable
[05:46:33] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: hey thats great 
[05:46:40] <uGoMobi_> less is more!
[05:46:45] <arschmitz> absolutly
[05:47:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i found a kinda significant bug in slider though
[05:48:35] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: what is that ?
[05:48:53] <arschmitz> no matter what the min and max and step are set to the slider has exactly 100 steps
[05:49:19] <arschmitz> so if you set a min of 0 and a max of 200 you will only be able to select even numbers using the slider
[05:49:21] <uGoMobi_> hmm
[05:49:38] <arschmitz> or if you do min of 0 and max of ten there will be ten steps per number 
[05:49:45] <uGoMobi_> that does sound as a bug
[05:50:11] <uGoMobi_> but it also sounds a bit like it has been done on purpose
[05:50:12] <arschmitz> it causes the handles on rane to not always line up exactly when they are at the same value
[05:50:22] <uGoMobi_> otherwise... where does the 100 come from
[05:50:27] <arschmitz> percent
[05:50:41] <arschmitz> its steped in intager percentages
[05:50:48] <uGoMobi_> yes i understand that can cuase issues
[05:51:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[05:52:02] <arschmitz> would be a pretty substantial refactor too i think though
[05:52:05] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: lets ask johnbender when he is here
[05:52:27] <uGoMobi_> he have been working on slider performance some time ago if i am not mistaken
[05:52:40] <uGoMobi_> yeah it sure is
[05:53:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah the ui one works correctly though so we might be able to steal some code from them :)
[05:54:11] <uGoMobi_> ok
[05:55:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: but yeah i think we should ask johnbender about it. 
[06:33:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: lol ok so not hard at all to fix slider
[06:35:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_:was able to fix by adding 2 lines and removing 7 lol
[06:35:50] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: ps your underscore is really throwing me off this morning lol
[06:36:30] <gseguin> mornin' folks
[06:36:44] <arschmitz> morning gseguin
[06:37:11] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: ok nice, let's ask johnbender if he knows why we did it the way we did it
[06:37:11] <gseguin> sorry for the flood of in/out messages on IRC
[06:37:14] <uGoMobi_> gseguin: morning
[06:37:23] <gseguin> don't know what happened there
[06:37:31] <uGoMobi_> hmm why did my nick change
[06:37:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_:of course but at least not as major of a refactor as i thought
[06:37:51] <uGoMobi_> yah thats good news
[06:38:02] <uGoMobi_> going to rejoin
[06:38:33] <gseguin> toddmparker, toddmparker_, uGoMobi_: http://ghislain.no-ip.biz/jqm/docs/demos/listviews/listview-filter-autocomplete.html
[06:38:44] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah it was kinda funny you were just flooding everywhere you were
[06:38:44] <gseguin> it needs some polish but that's a start
[06:39:44] <arschmitz> gseguin: nice seems to work well
[06:40:41] <gseguin> yeah, it works well except the spinner
[06:54:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi_: Your nick usually changes if you do not identify to NickServ ...
[06:56:06] <uGoMobi_> ah I see _|Nix|_ 
[07:04:03] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15halcyon1234 opened issue #5358: Documentation: Button Icon Tooltip  02http://git.io/u9EInQ
[07:50:20] <toddmparker> morning
[07:50:27] <toddmparker> catching up
[07:54:17] <toddmparker> gseguin: that autocomplete demo looks great
[07:54:31] <toddmparker> makes me wish we had keyboard support for lists
[07:54:53] <toddmparker> guess we could think about adding arrow up/down to that demo
[07:55:07] <toddmparker> seems fast on desktop, need to test on a phone
[07:55:46] <toddmparker> arschmitz: can't wait to see the new range. sounds like you were cranking
[07:57:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker: did you see about the bug in slider though?
[07:57:19] <toddmparker> i saw you mention that
[07:57:41] <arschmitz> toddmparker: its easily fixed but want to make sure there isnt a reason its done this way
[07:57:56] <toddmparker> so what's the deal?
[07:58:15] <arschmitz> the slider always has 100 steps regardless of min max and step you set
[07:58:36] <arschmitz> so if you have min 0 max ten each number has ten steps on the slider
[07:58:36] <toddmparker> hmm
[07:58:52] <arschmitz> or if you set min 0 max 200 you can only select even numbers with the slider
[07:59:12] <toddmparker> how wide is you slider there?
[07:59:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: width dosent matter slider just breaks it into 1% steps
[07:59:45] <toddmparker> granularity (range vs. width) and rounding (0-200, step 30) are both constraints there
[08:00:25] <toddmparker> well, if you had a 1-2,000 range and the slider was 200 pixels wide, 1px = 10
[08:02:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah there are constraints of course
[08:03:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i think the way ui does it seems a lot better though i have to look at it more but their slider respects steps.
[08:05:20] <arschmitz> and as far as granularity if the next step would leave the bounds it just goes to max or min
[08:06:19] <toddmparker> right, that part makes sense
[08:06:38] <arschmitz> and i think we would just need to decide on a min step size
[08:06:51] <arschmitz> defined in terms of %
[08:07:53] <toddmparker> http://jsbin.com/iqugob/1/edit
[08:08:00] <toddmparker> can you edit to show the issue?
[08:08:14] <toddmparker> i think the min. step was 1
[08:08:26] <toddmparker> which matches the way a numeric spinner works
[08:09:05] <arschmitz> yes just a second
[08:09:54] <toddmparker> i see, so 1-1,000, step=1 and is slides by 10
[08:10:00] <arschmitz> yes
[08:10:02] <toddmparker> that is a bug
[08:10:05] <arschmitz> sorry jsbin wont load for me
[08:10:30] <toddmparker> slider is ~300px for me so that should move by ~3
[08:10:37] <toddmparker> yeah, jsbin is hosed
[08:10:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker: its a pretty easy fix i already fixed it localy 
[08:11:11] <toddmparker> seems to use an order of magnitude kind thing
[08:11:12] <arschmitz> just need to decide on a minimum step size probably 1px?
[08:11:22] <toddmparker> if 1-1000, moves by 10
[08:11:32] <toddmparker> if 1-10,000 > moves by 100
[08:11:46] <toddmparker> at the same time, that kinda makes more sense
[08:12:14] <toddmparker> you don't end up with it sliding from 563 to 597 to 624
[08:12:23] <toddmparker> it rounds to cleaner increments
[08:12:50] <arschmitz> you also though end up with 1-10 each number has 10 possible locations for the handle
[08:13:44] <toddmparker> sure, we have a step of 1
[08:14:04] <toddmparker> i did see a request to support step="0.1"
[08:14:12] <toddmparker> which it won't do now
[08:14:17] <toddmparker> that could be cool
[08:14:23] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:14:30] <toddmparker> but for the larger numbers, the way it works now seems better imho
[08:14:43] <toddmparker> maybe we can adjust the ranges for where we round
[08:15:04] <toddmparker> but i think the native slider has a step/granularity of 1
[08:15:11] <arschmitz> its visually very weird for small ranges right now like 0-10 step of 1 
[08:15:21] <toddmparker> i wouldn't want to change that unless someone set it to 0.1
[08:15:32] <arschmitz> because the handle will move ten steps inbetween the values actually changing
[08:15:51] <toddmparker> that happens with a slider, seems ok to me
[08:16:07] <toddmparker> if people want to support more granular data, it would be nice to support that
[08:16:28] <toddmparker> but i wouldn't change the default step for smaller ranges to less than 1 just to fill space
[08:17:37] <toddmparker> slider are visually weird :)
[08:18:23] <arschmitz> the other issue currently is on any range smaller then 100 on range the handles wont always line up properly 
[08:18:35] <arschmitz> because they can have the same value with out being in the same place
[08:19:19] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to 06slide-panel-refactor: 02http://git.io/NmjELw
[08:19:19] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06slide-panel-refactor 143dbc59a 15Scott Jehl: method for getting a string of open classes, caching them for later removal
[08:20:12] <toddmparker> arschmitz: you mean the two sliders have slightly different tick marks?
[08:20:27] <arschmitz> no the handles on the sliders
[08:20:39] <arschmitz> can be in two different places even though they have the same value
[08:20:52] <toddmparker> so does that throw off the range fill
[08:21:04] <toddmparker> that seems like a bug
[08:21:13] <arschmitz> no it just looks very weird 
[08:21:18] <toddmparker> why would two identical sliders be different?
[08:21:42] <arschmitz> because if you have 0 - 10 each number has ten locations on the slider that represent it
[08:21:53] <arschmitz> so if slider a is at the first ocation of 5
[08:22:14] <arschmitz> and slider b is at the last ocation of 5 they have the same value but different locations
[08:23:00] <toddmparker> but the range is two identical sliders, stacked
[08:23:05] <arschmitz> right
[08:23:24] <arschmitz> hold on ill show you
[08:23:27] <toddmparker> so are you saying that if you do that,t eh plugin will produce different positions each time?
[08:23:34] <arschmitz> no
[08:23:46] <toddmparker> just wondering if the two sliders aren't quite aligned?
[08:23:57] <toddmparker> guess i need to see code/demo, sorry for being thick
[08:23:59] <arschmitz> no they are its an issue with the slider steps
[08:24:25] <toddmparker> oooh, i see
[08:24:37] <toddmparker> we need to snap the slider handles
[08:24:44] <arschmitz> YES!
[08:24:45] <toddmparker> that will fix it
[08:24:57] <toddmparker> just playing with a 25 step
[08:25:10] <arschmitz> sorry thats what iv been talking about the whole time sorry i dont know why i didnt just say snap
[08:25:18] <toddmparker> and it is odd that the handles don't snap to 25, 50, 75 even though the value does
[08:25:24] <arschmitz> right
[08:25:29] <toddmparker> yeah, terminology
[08:25:30] <arschmitz> thats what iv been taking about lol
[08:25:39] <toddmparker> yes, that is a bug and we should fix it
[08:25:43] <toddmparker> sorry
[08:25:46] <arschmitz> its ok
[08:25:54] <arschmitz> and thats what i was talking about for min step
[08:25:59] <arschmitz> something like 1px
[08:26:00] <toddmparker> gotcha
[08:26:24] <toddmparker> yes, when you drop a handle, it should snap to the closest tick mark position on the track
[08:26:30] <arschmitz> right
[08:26:36] <toddmparker> ideally with a little animation
[08:26:52] <toddmparker> supporting 0.1 step is a separate matter, but still useful
[08:26:59] <arschmitz> should we have it snap on release or just snap as you drag it?
[08:27:05] <toddmparker> funny i never noticed that
[08:27:19] <toddmparker> hmmm, dunno which will feel better
[08:27:34] <arschmitz> to make it snap on drag is super simple and will actually drop 10 lines of code from slider
[08:27:40] <toddmparker> as you drag would give better feedback but  would it scoot out from under your finger?
[08:27:49] <toddmparker> let's try that first then
[08:28:05] <arschmitz> if you had a very big step it might but with reasonable steps / sizes it should be fine
[08:28:12] <arschmitz> ok
[08:28:12] <toddmparker> for 1.4, we should offer a bounty for who can drop the greatest number of lines
[08:28:23] <arschmitz> that would be fun
[08:28:46] <arschmitz> but have to set guidlines for not combining lines so much it becomes too hard to read
[08:33:46] <toddmparker> yeah, not combining. simplifying.
[08:34:08] <toddmparker> panels are done, but we're re-factoring completely to simplify internals and features to the essentials.
[08:35:13] <arschmitz> nice
[08:39:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker: how about this for slider if the step will be less then 1px we fall back to how it is now. if it will be a step of 1 px or more it will snap as it should?
[09:04:35] <toddmparker> arschmitz: that seems reasonable
[09:04:51] <toddmparker> though even for the 1-10 slider, a better snap might make things clearer
[09:05:16] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i also addressed scott_gonzalez concern about clicking the track and which slider moves
[09:05:23] <toddmparker> maybe we could say "if the snap distance is less than 5px, don't move the handle"
[09:05:34] <toddmparker> arschmitz: yeah? cool
[09:05:39] <toddmparker> so what's the new behavior?
[09:05:52] <arschmitz> no if you click on either extrema it will adjust the closest slider
[09:06:04] <arschmitz> if you click in the middle it will be the one that has focus
[09:07:08] <arschmitz> not 100% the same as ui since there is always the closest one
[09:07:32] <arschmitz> but i think for us this is better since we are dealing with touch vs mouse events they are not nearly as accurate
[09:09:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker i could see always doing the cloest getting really frustrating on wp7
[09:13:34] <toddmparker> arschmitz: seems good
[09:13:49] <toddmparker> agree on wp7
[09:14:19] <arschmitz> toddmparker: but moving the closest one if you click on either extream of the track i think makes sense and is how it should be
[09:20:40] <toddmparker> yeah, agreed
[09:20:51] <toddmparker> so many little details to make things "just work"
[09:21:01] <toddmparker> fun to think through it all
[09:27:48] <arschmitz> yeah

[09:48:46] <agcolom> hi Alex!
[09:50:05] <toddmparker> hey agcolom 
[09:50:34] <agcolom> toddmparker: hello, did yu get my message about the responsive tables?
[09:51:13] <toddmparker> agcolom: errr, nope
[09:51:21] <toddmparker> say you made a docs fix
[09:51:41] <agcolom> yes, but that was not the problem...
[09:51:55] <agcolom> I sent via basecamp on sunday... anyone got it?
[09:51:59] <agcolom> let me check...
[09:52:45] <agcolom> yes, it is in basecamp... Here's the problem: when looking at http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-grids-responsive.html it seems that the breakpoint is set based on the width of the window. So when we have a wide screen and the docs menu on the left hand-side, the grids do not respond as expected on the set breakpoint. However, they do when the screen is slightly small and the menu g
[09:52:45] <agcolom> oes in the collapsible at the bottom of the page (but the area dedicated to the grid layout is wider).
[09:52:59] <toddmparker> ah, just saw it. never got an email
[09:53:22] <toddmparker> oh, you didn't check to notify anyone!
[09:53:42] <agcolom> no, I thought then it sent it to everyone?
[09:53:56] <agcolom> (or has something changed ;-) )
[09:54:08] <agcolom> I thought it was strange that noone was responding ;-)
[09:54:51] <toddmparker> Yes, this is really the issue with breakpoints in general - they are always based on the window, not the content area, so the breakpoint is essentially thrown off by the width of that left nav. The only solution is to write custom media queries that take the layout and contents into account.
[09:55:21] <agcolom> yes, I think we need to make that very clear in the docs. 
[09:55:57] <toddmparker> that's the issue - 90% of that page explains this, and how to write your own media queries
[09:55:58] <agcolom> ( that it's not based on the width available to the table.... )
[09:56:20] <agcolom> ok. 
[09:56:34] <toddmparker> right. people assume that, but it's not how media queries work
[09:56:52] <toddmparker> so please feel free to punch that up wherever you see fit
[09:57:11] <toddmparker> the new docs may not have a fixed leftnav for this reason
[09:57:32] <agcolom> sure, will do... yes the new docs will not have that pb :-)
[09:57:41] <agcolom> the other point is about the api docs...
[09:57:57] <agcolom> so both tables are actually just one widget, right?
[09:58:21] <toddmparker> there is a table plugin that handles a lot of the utility stuff
[09:58:43] <toddmparker> but you can probably just document these as separate widgets that just happen to depend on table.js
[09:58:44] <agcolom> so there will be one single entry.... I'm just wondering how to best document methods/options/events.... 
[09:59:06] <toddmparker> that's why i'd treat these as separate.
[09:59:07] <agcolom> (well I'm just doing reflow and toggle column for now)
[09:59:12] <toddmparker> they have different configs
[09:59:33] <agcolom> indeed...
[09:59:43] <toddmparker> the fact that they are written as extensions to the table.js is really an implementation detail
[09:59:52] <toddmparker> so i'd try it that way
[10:00:06] <agcolom> my understanding is that we should have one entry per widget (which is why I had to merge radio buttons and checkboxes for example)
[10:00:49] <agcolom> (and text input/textarea and search inputs are all into one as well)
[10:01:33] <agcolom> maybe I can check this one with Scott G as in this case we have separate options/methods/events?
[10:02:06] <agcolom> maybe there is a configuration setup for this case that I have not come across yet...
[10:03:03] <toddmparker> well, when you merged, it's because checkboxradio.js is one script
[10:03:07] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15scottjehl pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/iuJgaQ
[10:03:07] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14522c3d7 15Scott Jehl: whitespace only
[10:03:11] <toddmparker> these are separate scripts
[10:03:22] <toddmparker> but it's a good Q
[10:03:28] <toddmparker> maybe scott_gonzalez has ideas
[10:03:39] <agcolom> ok.... so what are the names of the 2 widgets?
[10:03:56] <toddmparker> table.columntoggle.js
[10:04:03] <toddmparker> table.reflow.js
[10:04:10] <agcolom> ok,
[10:04:11] <toddmparker> both depend on and extend table.js
[10:04:27] <agcolom> and then they both have tablecreate as event?
[10:04:45] <scott_gonzalez> what's going on?
[10:04:52] <agcolom> hey scott_gonzalez !
[10:05:02] <toddmparker> mayhem. pure mayhem.
[10:05:15] <toddmparker> so for 1.3, we have these new responsive tables
[10:05:20] <agcolom> we have 2 widgets: table.columntoggle.js and able.reflow.js
[10:05:26] <agcolom> table.reflow.js
[10:05:49] <toddmparker> there are two styles - reflow (stacks data at phone widths) and column toggle (lets you choose which cols to view)
[10:06:27] <agcolom> they both depend on and extend table.js
[10:06:32] <toddmparker> technically, these are separate plugins written as extensions to table.js which pretty much just provides some utilities of parsing table data
[10:06:46] <agcolom> the question is how to document this in the api docs
[10:07:08] <agcolom> is it ok to have 2 entries and how would they be named?
[10:07:09] <toddmparker> we did it that way because people may just want to use one mode and this lets them strip out the other mode's code in the download builder
[10:07:27] <toddmparker> right.
[10:07:42] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #934: FAILURE in 19 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/934/
[10:07:42] <agcolom> (they have separate options and methods)
[10:08:00] <toddmparker> i was saying we could document them as separate widgets that just depend on table.js since each has a different API
[10:08:53] <scott_gonzalez> They're both exposed as the same plugin with different options?
[10:09:07] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps 3 docs pages.
[10:09:23] <scott_gonzalez> 1 for the base with some basic docs and a link to the other two pages.
[10:09:36] <agcolom> sounds good
[10:09:40] <scott_gonzalez> And then one for each extension that documents the full API when using that extension.
[10:09:56] <agcolom> I was just wondering where to put the common description
[10:10:01] <toddmparker> works for me
[10:10:35] <toddmparker> the table plugin will be light, just exposes a class and initSelector option and a create event
[10:10:40] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: so for tables (the basic one), should it have no option/methods or should it list all of them?
[10:10:55] <toddmparker> agcolom: what's the basic one?
[10:11:00] <scott_gonzalez> It should list whatever is built into the base iwdget.

[10:11:21] <scott_gonzalez> Whatever's in table.js
[10:11:22] <toddmparker> right. it's very simple.
[10:12:17] <toddmparker> agcolom: there are 2 options, an event
[10:12:30] <agcolom> perfect! Thanks
[10:12:40] <agcolom> then how should we name the other 2?
[10:13:02] <agcolom> (table.js will be table widget in table.xml)
[10:13:24] <toddmparker> does naming just follow the .js files?

[10:59:05] <toddmparker> jenkins is having a bad day
[10:59:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker: http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/range.html all updated
[10:59:26] <toddmparker> *looking*
[11:00:26] <toddmparker> arschmitz: this looks great
[11:00:29] <toddmparker> nice work!
[11:01:04] <toddmparker> the only comment I have on the snapping is if it's a small snap like the 1-100, 1px it just feels jerky so i think we might want to tinker with some sort of a threshold
[11:01:35] <toddmparker> otherwise, this looks fantastic
[11:02:10] <arschmitz> toddmparker: the one 1 - 100 is above the 1px threshold 
[11:02:32] <arschmitz> so thats actually the normal behivor exactly
[11:03:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker: with what step sorry?
[11:04:01] <toddmparker> the snap as you drag
[11:04:24] <arschmitz> toddmparker: right there are 2 1-100's the step of 1 or the step of 3?
[11:04:39] <arschmitz> or 0 - 100 rather
[11:07:52] <Wiltopedia> IRCCloud is 100% on fire for some reason.
[11:08:38] <arschmitz> Wiltopedia: its your encyclopedic knowodge of Wilto it just cant handle it
[11:14:32] <Wilto_> Few websites can.
[11:23:34] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i wrote an extension to range slider to add the "push" option the person on the issue wanted. that way we can just make it a demo. I added this to the demo at http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/range.html 
[11:26:07] <JasonDScott__> hey toddmparker 
[11:26:27] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/slide-panel/css/structure/jquery.mobile.panel.css
[11:38:45] <toddmparker> arschmitz: can we support multi-touch for sliders so you can use both at once?

[11:54:16] <toddmparker> arschmitz: just testing the sliders on the iPad and they work great. forget my comment relier re: steps
[11:55:38] <toddmparker> what? you wrote a push extension too? damn.
[11:56:35] <toddmparker> wonder if we're snapping to 0.1, if the whole number should still be "7.0" not "7"
[11:58:32] <toddmparker> also, should we support 0.01 steps? might end up rounding up because there aren't enough pixels, just wondering if for scientific apps, you might need a high precision, but tight range slider like 0.00 to 0.10 with 0.01 increments. if it's more than a quick change, let's skip it. the ).1 step is a nice improvement.
[12:00:24] <toddmparker> arschmitz ^^
[12:01:37] <toddmparker> oh, last Q. how hard would it be to allow you to slide the range fill to shift it? so you can grab the blue fill and slide that instead of moving both handles. Again, if it's not a huge amount of work.

[12:27:39] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[12:28:03] <uGoMobi> with me better than with IRCCloud :/
[12:28:33] <uGoMobi> have problems with Google too
[12:29:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: just added swipe list demo
[12:30:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: nice work on the range slider
[12:33:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Do what I do: set up a small Linux box and forward SSH to it from the Internet. Then, run irssi inside screen on the Linux box. Then, you can log into it from anywhere with ssh -t username@ip screen -dr freenode
[12:34:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Your very own irccloud :)
[12:34:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks for the advise, will look into that
[12:35:30] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and you have a domain, too ... instead of username@ip, you could do, like, uGoMobi@irc.ugomobi.com ...
[12:35:37] <uGoMobi> looks like something is wrong with nav on IE9 
[12:35:45] <uGoMobi> ah cool
[12:36:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lemme guess: closing the popup goes back two pages?
[12:36:11] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:36:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Just kidding - I hope not.
[12:36:26] <uGoMobi> no not even
[12:36:48] <uGoMobi> I nav from one page to another and get a blank screen

[12:42:18] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: not good
[12:46:00] <arschmitz> Thanks uGoMobi: did a lot of work on it this weekend 
[12:48:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker: multi-touch im not sure ill have to look into it
[12:49:32] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah the push extension is incredibly simple basicly extend the options object and change one line in one method
[12:50:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: the number formating is being done by the browser not us
[12:53:06] <arschmitz> toddmparker: we do support .01 steps as long as there are enough pixels we support any step as long as there are enough pixels (added one showing .01)
[12:53:35] <arschmitz> toddmparker: dragging the fill would be sweet ill put some thought into it 
[12:59:40] <toddmparker> arschmitz: ok on number formatting, cool we support 0.01 if room allows
[12:59:53] <toddmparker> fill drag would be sweet

[13:21:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's what I was wondering. If we aren't sure we want to apply this at some point we can just close the ticket and add to the feature request wiki page

[13:23:18] <uGoMobi> then we set a milestone
[13:25:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK. I say wiki it.
[13:25:55] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: +1
[13:26:05] <uGoMobi> will take care of it
[13:26:30] <agcolom> toddmparker: I've attempted to do the table (basic) widget... could you please check whether this is correct ?
[13:26:48] <agcolom> http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/table/
[13:27:13] <uGoMobi> BTW - the story with IE9 is that if you nav from one page to another in multipage template you first get to see completely blank page and only see the page after you refresh it
[13:27:30] <uGoMobi> will test with another page too
[13:27:31] <agcolom> (I am not sure at all about the options)
[13:28:26] <agcolom> also, is this option also exposed as data-role="table"?
[13:31:56] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Re: also exposed as data- attribute.... yes... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/table.js#L18
[13:32:56] <uGoMobi> it's not really an option though
[13:35:23] <agcolom> uGoMobi: thanks. If it's not an option, how should it be documented? (todd told me 2 options and 1 event, so that's what I did... )
[13:35:39] <agcolom> I'm open to suggestions :-)
[13:37:04] <uGoMobi> initSelector is an option
[13:37:20] <uGoMobi> at least for now
[13:38:35] <uGoMobi> that means that you could change ":jqmData(role='table')" into "table"
[13:39:04] <uGoMobi> and all table elements will be enhanced
[13:39:25] <agcolom> oh! ok!
[13:40:01] <uGoMobi> but data-role="table" but does not set an option
[13:40:48] <uGoMobi> sorry for confusing you.. I thought you meant if data-role="table" works
[13:41:31] <agcolom> yes, the confusion for me was when I was trying to find an example of data to use in the option! 
[13:41:38] <agcolom> I couldn't think of any! 
[13:42:01] <agcolom> so it's a bit like an option that you don't change?
[13:42:12] <uGoMobi> it's more an equivalent of the method .table()
[13:42:22] <agcolom> or if you make it empty you don't get responsive tables?
[13:42:57] <uGoMobi> you can initialize the table plugin with the initSelector (which is data-role="table" by default) or with the method .table()
[13:43:22] <uGoMobi> how do you mean empty?
[13:44:04] <uGoMobi> with options data- attributes work like... data-theme="b" sets option "theme" to value "b"
[13:45:00] <uGoMobi> but data-role="table" does not set the option "role" to value "table"
[13:45:14] <uGoMobi> because there is no option "role"
[13:45:38] <uGoMobi> so that's the difference
[13:45:57] <uGoMobi> it's just a way to trigger the auto-initialization
[13:53:26] <agcolom> uGoMobi: I mean classes.table = ""
[13:53:42] <agcolom> (or something like that?)
[13:57:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't believe there is a general option classes.table but only classes.columnBtn classes.columnToggleTable etc.
[13:59:23] <uGoMobi> at least some of those can be set to null (nothing), not sure if there also ones that always require a class name
[13:59:43] <toddmparker> hey all, back
[13:59:50] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker 
[14:00:02] <agcolom> hey toddmparker I am confused :-)
[14:00:30] <agcolom> is classes.table an option for the table widget?
[14:00:37] <toddmparker> yeah _|Nix|_ - close that popup thing as a feature
[14:00:43] <toddmparker> seems like trouble
[14:00:44] <agcolom> basically, this is correct: http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/table/
[14:00:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I already did
[14:01:20] <uGoMobi> agcolom: this is not correct http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/table/#option-classes.table
[14:01:33] <uGoMobi> classes.tableType: String
[14:01:33] <uGoMobi> Default: "ui-table"
[14:01:33] <uGoMobi> Class assigned to the table.
[14:01:33] <uGoMobi> This option is also exposed as a data attribute:data-role="table"
[14:02:03] <toddmparker> agcolom: yes, data-role="table"
[14:03:22] <toddmparker> the classes.table is part of the core table plugin, but it really just sets what class the framework adds to the table when you init it
[14:03:47] <uGoMobi> data-role="table" is not used to set option classes.table
[14:03:57] <toddmparker> oh, no.
[14:04:29] <toddmparker> data-role="table" is used by the init selector to say what markup pattern to auto init table on
[14:04:44] <toddmparker> the classes.table is just what class we tack on when enhanced
[14:05:06] <uGoMobi> sorry I was wrong with ...  I don't believe there is a general option classes.table ... didn't see it at first and it is not in the current docs
[14:05:12] <toddmparker> This option is also exposed as a data attribute:data-role="table".
[14:05:19] <toddmparker> ^^ that part is wrong
[14:05:25] <uGoMobi> yep
[14:06:00] <agcolom> toddmparker: ok, so I remove this  This option is also exposed as a data attribute:data-role="table".
[14:06:02] <toddmparker> we say this about class in reflow: 
[14:06:03] <toddmparker> The reflow mode has one option, classes, which is only configurable via JavaScript because it expects an object literal value. The classes option has two properties that define the structural classnames that the plugin uses:
[14:06:40] <toddmparker> we could say:
[14:06:41] <toddmparker> The classes option is only configurable via JavaScript because it expects an object literal value.
[14:06:45] <toddmparker> as a generic thing
[14:07:18] <agcolom> for classes.table?
[14:07:43] <agcolom> (oh, you mean for all of the classes.?)
[14:08:21] <toddmparker> we could probably just say something like that for all classes.
[14:08:33] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: what say you? is there a better way to say this
[14:08:53] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: no, seems clear to me
[14:08:59] <agcolom> what should I say as a small description of that option?
[14:09:20] <uGoMobi> most important part is that you can only set it programmatically,,, no data- attributes
[14:09:25] <toddmparker> Class assigned to the table.
[14:09:32] <toddmparker> ^^ seems fine to me as-is
[14:09:36] <agcolom> ok
[14:10:05] <toddmparker> so just rep;ace the line about data-attr with the line above and we're good
[14:10:19] <toddmparker> so agcolom - one note as you mov eon to reflow...
[14:10:57] <agcolom> yes
[14:11:13] <toddmparker> we set table up to default to reflow if data-mode wasn't set
[14:11:31] <agcolom> ok
[14:11:34] <toddmparker> in the docs, let's show that attar being set on the reflow table
[14:11:38] <toddmparker> just for clarity
[14:12:00] <toddmparker> since we're sort of documenting these as standalone
[14:12:37] <toddmparker> i left it out on my page but just to be really clear
[14:13:20] <agcolom> ok, so you want one example where it;s not set and it gets set automatically?
[14:15:23] <agcolom> (for the reflow table?)

[14:23:47] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: do we have a standard way of saying that there are no methods for a widget?
[14:24:37] <scott_gonzalez> That's impossible.
[14:24:51] <scott_gonzalez> There are 3 methods provided by the base widget.
[14:25:05] <agcolom> ok, 
[14:25:17] <agcolom> are they public methods?
[14:25:30] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, there are many more non-public methods provided by the base widget.
[14:25:47] <scott_gonzalez> I take that back, there are 5 public methods.
[14:25:48] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jqueryui.com/jQuery.widget/#jQuery-Widget2
[14:26:25] <agcolom> toddmparker: uGoMobi is that the case for mobile too?
[14:26:28] <agcolom> ^
[14:26:29] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[14:26:50] <toddmparker> is there any way to not have masked inputs ruin accessibility? this is pretty compelling: http://wil.to/input-masking.mp4
[14:27:04] <toddmparker> interestingly, it doesn't read ( ) or -
[14:27:18] <toddmparker> maybe the choice of characters used could be carefully chosen
[14:27:41] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: (so are these 5 the  without the _ )?
[14:27:59] <scott_gonzalez> yes

[14:28:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: interesting
[14:28:17] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: The characters spoken are based on user settings.
[14:28:44] <scott_gonzalez> You can control punctuation verbosity. I think "most punctuation" is a common setting.
[14:29:13] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender I rebased simple-nav. The new base is simple-nav-rebase. I haven't run any of the tests yet. Please have a look to see if I've made all the right choices in my merges.
[14:29:14] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[14:29:51] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: interesting
[14:30:09] <toddmparker> so if you reduce verbosity from the default, it might be less annoying
[14:31:22] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps, though it would affect everything that the AT reads.
[14:32:19] <Wilto_> Even with “invisible” characters like the parens, it’s baffling when you tab into a text field and it announces that your cursor is at a certain position.
[14:32:33] <Wilto_> Because that means there’s text in there, but you can’t “see” it.
[14:32:56] <Wilto_> So, any user like me will end up mashing delete a bunch of times—until it stops reading off a text position. Which it never would.
[14:33:23] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: toddmparker so does this mean that we must have at least these 5 methods that all widgets have?
[14:35:02] <agcolom> (in the api docs)
[14:35:13] <agcolom> it is not the case currently....
[14:35:20] <scott_gonzalez> yes
[14:35:36] <agcolom> so that's why you have the include!
[14:35:36] <scott_gonzalez> Every widget should document its full API, which includes these methods.
[14:36:09] <agcolom> Can I steal it from you then? 
[14:36:17] <agcolom> (copy I mean ;-) )
[14:36:30] <arschmitz> scott_gonzalez: agcolom: many of our widgets a currently missing proper destroy and setOption methods so we may not want to document those untill they are actually working
[14:36:48] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: of course
[14:37:09] <agcolom> arschmitz: ok, so we need a plan! 
[14:37:24] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: thanks :-)
[14:38:34] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah might want to ask toddmparker how he wants to handle widgets that are not currently handleing the widget factory public methods as they should
[14:38:59] <agcolom> ok, maybe an item for next meeting then...
[14:39:04] <agcolom> right, this time I must go to bed as I have to be up at 6.30 am tomorrow :-( 
[14:39:05] <arschmitz> agcolom: we are going to be fixing them all for 1.4 but for the time being documenting them when they dont work would probably be a bad idea
[14:39:16] <arschmitz> agcolom goodnight
[14:39:38] <uGoMobi> Wilto_: I think there is a problem with the CSS transitions and transform support tests: they always return false http://jsbin.com/osiwuw/3
[14:39:40] <agcolom> arschmitz: sure. Let;s target 1.4 for that then.
[14:39:53] <agcolom> Goodnight....
[14:48:29] <toddmparker> yeah, we have plans to re-vamp a lot of the widget api stuff for 1.4
[14:48:31] <uGoMobi> IE9 is not only broken with multipage template, also with single pages... the docs are broken to
[14:48:36] <toddmparker> question is what to do now
[14:48:38] <uGoMobi> too
[14:48:43] <toddmparker> what the...
[14:49:14] <toddmparker> funny our tests didn't catch that
[14:49:29] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:49:38] <uGoMobi> you don't get an error though
[14:49:44] <uGoMobi> just a completely blank page
[14:49:50] <uGoMobi> not on the homepage of the docs
[14:50:03] <uGoMobi> but as soon as you navigate (transition)
[14:50:36] <toddmparker> that's nuts
[14:50:46] <toddmparker> wasn't the case until recently
[14:50:47] <uGoMobi> since it looks like the transition and transform test work properly ^^ it could be a regression from the unprefixed transitions merge
[14:51:01] <uGoMobi> don't work properly
[14:51:06] <toddmparker> hmmm
[14:51:09] <uGoMobi> sorry, can't type today
[14:51:57] <uGoMobi> I always get false... http://jsbin.com/osiwuw/3
[14:52:35] <Wilto_> Heard I broke some stuff.
[14:52:43] <uGoMobi> but it doesn't stop transitions from working
[14:52:47] <uGoMobi> hey Wilto_ 
[14:53:10] <Wilto__> Friggin’ IRCCloud.
[14:53:14] <uGoMobi> haha
[14:53:17] <Wilto__> Anyway, hi. Heard I broke stuff.
[14:53:17] <uGoMobi> same here
[14:53:29] <uGoMobi> finally managed to get usual nick back
[14:54:08] <uGoMobi> Wilto__: yeah can you check that transition/transform test http://jsbin.com/osiwuw/3
[14:54:11] <Wilto__> So yeah. IE9 is now getting page transitions, but I assume we’re listening to transitionEnd somewhere.
[14:54:36] <Wilto__> Woah, why am I getting “false” in Chrome?
[14:55:58] <uGoMobi> exactly
[14:56:06] <uGoMobi> same on Android
[14:56:27] <uGoMobi> Wilto__: IE9 shouldn't get page transitions, only IE10
[14:56:45] <Wilto__> Woah, hang on.
[14:56:52] <Wilto__> Something has gone wrong, here.
[14:57:00] <_|Nix|_> Wilto__: We are, in js/jquery.mobile.transition.js, and .animationComplete( callback ) === setTimeout( callback, 0 ) when $.support.cssTransitions is false.
[14:57:15] <Wilto__> Ah, okay.
[14:57:19] <Wilto__> Iiiinteresting.
[14:57:28] <Wilto__> Open issue for this?
[14:58:37] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender popup and sequence tests need fixing after the rebase. I'll look at it when in about 8 hours.
[14:58:37] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[14:58:42] <_|Nix|_> L8R all.
[14:58:43] <Wilto__> On it.
[14:58:45] * _|Nix|_ go bed
[14:58:50] <uGoMobi> night _|Nix|_ 
[14:59:08] <uGoMobi> want me to open a ticket Wilto__ ?
[14:59:27] <uGoMobi> or are you already looking into it?
[15:00:12] <toddmparker> night _|Nix|_ 
[15:00:14] <Wilto__> Oh, yeah, that’d be awesome. Digging into the issue a bit now, but I gotta run shortly.

[15:08:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: rebase?
[15:08:00] <bot-t> (38 mins 40 secs ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender I rebased simple-nav. The new base is simple-nav-rebase. I haven't run any of the tests yet. Please have a look to see if I've made all the right choices in my merges.
[15:08:01] <bot-t> (9 mins 24 secs ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender popup and sequence tests need fixing after the rebase. I'll look at it when in about 8 hours.
[15:08:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I pushed a merged version to simple-nav-merge I would work from there
[15:08:46] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ I would look at simple-nav-merge I already went through all that and made a bunch of test corrections
[15:08:47] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[15:08:59] <Wilto__> but I read on the internet that rebasing is bad
[15:09:03] <Wilto__> or maybe good
[15:09:07] <Wilto__> who can keep track anymore
[15:10:45] <johnbender> toddmparker: sorry I haven't been around today I had to take Mila to the doctor and I've been administering bronchial dialaters every 3 hours since for about 40 minutes :/
[15:10:55] <Wilto__> Oh damn.
[15:11:58] <johnbender> ?tell _|Nix|_ all the test corrections in simple-nav-merge are single commits so they can be reverted if you like
[15:11:58] <bot-t> johnbender, Okay.
[15:14:28] <toddmparker> johnbender: sheesh, sorry to hear that.
[15:14:31] <toddmparker> she ok?
[15:16:37] <Wilto__> uGoMobi, toddmparker: I’m gonna patch that up in the morning, if you guys are cool with leaving it un-reverted overnight.
[15:16:59] <uGoMobi> Wilto__: yeah np
[15:17:03] <Wilto__> Cool.
[15:18:29] <uGoMobi> Wilto__: will be here all day tomorrow so if you need help with testing or anything let me know
[15:19:08] <Wilto__> Will do, man. Thanks!
[15:28:33] <johnbender> toddmparker: oh yah
[15:28:44] <johnbender> she was just having trouble breathing this morning 
[15:28:53] <johnbender> she's normally so happy it's obvious when something is wrong

[23:06:49] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender Your daughter is slightly younger than mine. Ours developed this problem at exactly the same time. Doctors here in Finland gave us such an inhaler as well.
[23:06:50] <bot-t1> (7 hours 58 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ I would look at simple-nav-merge I already went through all that and made a bunch of test corrections
[23:06:50] <bot-t1> (7 hours 54 mins ago) <johnbender> tell _|Nix|_ all the test corrections in simple-nav-merge are single commits so they can be reverted if you like
[23:06:50] <bot-t1> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[23:08:50] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender They said it's because her larynx hasn't fully hardened yet, and so it tends to expand when she sleeps. It's really scary and it can be dangerous (hence the inhaler), but it's supposed to go away by itself as they get older (~ age 3) and the larynx hardens into its permanent state.
[23:08:50] <bot-t1> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[23:13:53] <uGoMobi> morning _|Nix|_ 
[23:15:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
