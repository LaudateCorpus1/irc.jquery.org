[09:37:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: just need to make those changes and let everyone know in a quick PSA to use enhanceWithin on create in the project
[09:37:33] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the other question I had is, should we document this for plugin authors?
[09:37:37] <miketaylr> toddmparker_: mmm fame.
[09:37:51] <johnbender> we want them to respect that option too
[09:40:56] <toddmparker_> johnbender: yes, could you add this to the docs as part of the api stuff and also add a section, maybe under "scripting pages" with a simple code example of how to use. think that's a good place for it.

[09:48:51] <Wilto> That is a good question, sir.
[09:48:57] <Wilto> If there are, I didn’t write ’em.
[09:49:07] <johnbender> Wilto: cool I'll go take a look
[09:49:14] <johnbender> just wondering before I push this test
[09:49:17] <johnbender> err

[10:05:40] <toddmparker_> if not, maybe johnbender can take a look. comment on a commit.
[10:05:58] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: should we apply ignoring content to dialogs and pages?
[10:06:08] <johnbender> nevermind
[10:06:11] <johnbender> I'll just do it
[10:06:15] <kinblas> yes
[10:06:17] <kinblas> :-)
[10:06:19] <toddmparker_> think so
[10:06:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll take a look
[10:06:24] <toddmparker_> should work anywhere really
[10:06:39] <toddmparker_> well, kinblas is here i guess. see above kin ^^
[10:12:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I think it's just a special case where we have two competing ui states :(
[10:12:42] <kinblas> gseguin: johnbender: so I thought I was supposed to be able to see the other js files loaded by require.js in the browser debugger?
[10:12:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm wondering if that works without replace state turned on
[10:13:07] <johnbender> kinblas: are you looking at the jquerymobile.com docs?
[10:13:24] <kinblas> yeah
[10:13:31] <kinblas> nevermind I guess it folds it all into jquery.mobile.js?
[10:13:33] <johnbender> kinblas: we concat those to speed up the load time

[10:13:59] <toddmparker_> johnbender: agreed. i flippin hate nested list pages
[10:14:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I say we take them out for 2.0
[10:14:10] <toddmparker_> really wish i had pull those when i had a chance
[10:14:30] <johnbender> we can move them to an unsupported plugin or something
[10:14:33] <toddmparker_> i tried floating the idea at alpha and it was the only time there wasoutcry with a change
[10:14:40] <toddmparker_> but they are abused
[10:14:45] <toddmparker_> and cause trouble
[10:14:45] <johnbender> yerp
[10:15:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: tradeoffs with conventions come
[10:15:50] <johnbender> </yoda>
[10:16:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll open up an issue for that conversation
[10:18:24] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3551
[10:18:25] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3551 on jquery-mobile, reported by johnbender (18.214s ago): Dialogs embedded in nested list pages break the hash
[10:18:53] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I think I see the problem. We strip off the dialogHashKey, but we don't do the same for the nested key (&ui-page=...)
[10:19:02] <toddmparker_> tho i wonder if in this case if we just need to tighten up our regex to just remove the #&ui-state=dialog when you close a dialog or custom select menu
[10:19:16] <toddmparker_> right
[10:19:21] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm betting it's in pushstate when we reset the keys
[10:19:36] <johnbender> haven't tried disabling yet though
[10:19:54] <kinblas> this particular problem (pointed out in my commit) has to do with nested lists
[10:20:00] <toddmparker_> this does seem fixable
[10:20:31] <toddmparker_> i'd like to push nested out as a 3rd party widget eventually
[10:21:22] <kinblas> toddmparker_: are we supposed to be able to deep-link nested list references?
[10:21:41] <toddmparker_> hmmm, not sure
[10:21:50] <toddmparker_> i think not
[10:22:00] <toddmparker_> be nice but i don't think we built it that way
[10:22:07] <toddmparker_> could be wrong
[10:22:31] <toddmparker_> we've been neglecting that code because of our dislike of the feature :)

[10:49:33] <gseguin> is there a reason we chose to create a new custom event instead ?
[10:50:56] <kinblas> gseguin: I can't remember
[10:50:59] * kinblas sighs
[10:51:35] <gseguin> that's ok, I think it's safer to just mixin the target than go back to the previous version

[11:11:10] <johnbender> kinblas: at first I was thinking that the perf hit for this ignore option wouldn't *too* bad
[11:11:39] <johnbender> but I forgot that taking a set of jquery selected results and using closest will get you _any_ elements parent
[11:11:45] <johnbender> that might have that attribute
[11:11:56] <johnbender> so you have to check for each selected element :(

[13:11:28] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] fix for misnamed var in widget - John Bender
[13:28:57] <johnbender> kinblas: for links and forms did you envision checking at click time or enhance time for a jqmData(ignore) parent?
[13:30:29] <kinblas> johnbender: that's what the *other* bug was about
[13:30:50] <kinblas> remember I intentionally split out the enhance vs click-handling
[13:30:54] <johnbender> ah
[13:31:03] <kinblas> because the developer might want to supress enhancment so they can do something different
[13:31:07] <johnbender> because of that specific implementation detail then?
[13:31:10] <kinblas> but still want the auto-click-handling
[13:31:35] <kinblas> on the flip-side, they may want to just say hands off all these links in this container
[13:31:42] <johnbender> kinblas: hmm so the forms and links should _not_ respect that ignore attribute then
[13:31:57] <johnbender> hah
[13:31:58] <johnbender> or not
[13:32:05] <kinblas> the ignore attribute is ignore enhancement?
[13:32:11] <johnbender> yes
[13:32:17] <kinblas> yeah that's something different
[13:32:37] <johnbender> kinblas: so you want ignore-hijax or similar
[13:35:16] <kinblas> or if there's a better name yeah ... todd might have an opinion there
[13:36:14] <johnbender> kinblas: that'll actually be exceedingly easy
[13:36:24] <johnbender> I can just add an optional param for the selector
[13:36:30] <johnbender> default to -ignore
[13:40:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you have an suggestions for naming a data attribute which will tell the framework to leave links inside the annotated container alone?
[13:41:24] <johnbender> data-nav-ignore, data-ignore-nav, data-ignore-ajax ??
[13:42:47] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!

[13:42:52] <johnbender> kinblas: so that still doesn't answer my question though
[13:43:15] <johnbender> kinblas: do we want to prevent the _binding_ or just the execution of the binding
[13:43:19] <johnbender> err
[13:43:23] <johnbender> the execution of the bound callback
[13:43:49] <kinblas> it depends on if you want to allow folks to dynamically change the value
[13:44:01] <kinblas> I say the attribute is only at enhancement time (prevents the binding)
[13:44:01] <johnbender> exactly, that's why I'm asking :D
[13:44:11] <kinblas> if they want something fancier on/off switches
[13:44:13] <johnbender> and it's less painful then too
[13:44:16] <kinblas> then they use the callback approach
[13:44:28] <johnbender> perf wise
[13:44:33] <kinblas> agreed
[13:45:17] <johnbender> kinblas: that will certainly take some doing though :D
[13:50:17] <toddmparker_> does this also exclude from enhancements?
[13:50:40] <toddmparker_> for example, if I have an input in this container, will it enhance it automatically?
[13:50:46] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes
[13:50:47] <toddmparker_> johnbender ^^
[13:51:09] <toddmparker_> ok, easy enough to data-role="none" that
[13:51:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: if you want to ignore other enhancements it's data-ignore right now
[13:51:31] <johnbender> which is totally up for change
[13:51:41] <johnbender> just made the most sense when I was hacking it
[13:51:41] <toddmparker_> so are there 2 new features? completely ignore or enhance but don't hijax?
[13:51:56] <johnbender> yes, enhancement is data-ignore
[13:52:01] <toddmparker_> gotcha
[13:52:02] <toddmparker_> cool
[13:52:04] <johnbender> links will be something else
[13:52:10] <johnbender> just not sure what to call it
[13:52:24] <johnbender> if they want to ignore both they would use both I guess
[13:52:43] <johnbender> in which case data-ignore might be misleading
[13:53:00] <toddmparker_> yeah
[13:53:05] <Wilto> Yo yo.
[13:53:06] <toddmparker_> ignote sounds like a super set
[13:53:12] <johnbender> indeed
[13:53:17] <Wilto> Todd just told me about this business, and I dig it.
[13:53:25] <toddmparker_> data-enhance="false" (ignore)
[13:53:42] <toddmparker_> data-ajax="false" (hijax)
[13:53:51] <Wilto> Yeah, I like those.
[13:53:54] <toddmparker_> we already have data-ajax on the link/form level
[13:54:09] <toddmparker_> so this is just granting that at the parent level
[13:54:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: makes sense
[13:54:24] <toddmparker_> that is pattern i like to use
[13:54:41] <toddmparker_> fetchlinks have this same notion, add the data-target on the link or the parent
[13:54:57] <Wilto> This new “mini” thing too, in some cases.

[14:13:18] <toddmparker_> some are in the widget factory...but just a few
[14:16:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to header-footer-widgets: http://git.io/V8QJjA
[14:16:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/header-footer-widgets] Added mini version of toggle switch; ensured slider handles (which are handled the same as buttons) were unaffected by parent controlgroups. - scottjehl
[14:24:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: what do you mean they are "in" the widget factory?
[14:26:57] <Wilto> …Why did that just attribute my commit to Scott?
[14:28:13] <Wilto> Oh, it appears I am the worst. Awesome/
[14:28:38] <Wilto> No harm done I guess, but sorry about the gross commit.
[14:31:11] <gseguin> kinblas, johnbender: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.page.sections.js#L59
[14:31:40] <gseguin> Shouldn't that read `$page.jqmData( "url" )` ?
[14:32:10] <gseguin> $this here is the header, how would the header end up with its jqmData("url") set ?
[14:38:17] <johnbender> gseguin: certainly looks that way
[14:41:04] <gseguin> thanks I'll change that
[14:41:47] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm going to step out on a limb there and say that particular contidtional isn't tested :D

[14:55:39] <gseguin> johnbender: Yeah it's not a very common usecase I think
[14:59:16] <Wilto> Hey johnbender, question for you.
[14:59:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 2 new commits to header-footer-widgets: http://git.io/9_UaNQ
[14:59:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/header-footer-widgets] Added mini form element gallery. Adorable. - Mat Marquis
[14:59:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/header-footer-widgets] Updated /forms pages’ navigation with link to new mini form gallery page. - Mat Marquis
[15:00:29] <Wilto> johnbender: If I’m moving these new mini-widgets to master, what’s my best approach?
[15:00:39] <Wilto> I’m guessing it’s not cherry-picking the commits by hand.
[15:10:00] <Wilto> …okay, think I got it.
[15:10:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/P3nNPg
[15:10:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixing conflicts. - Mat Marquis
[15:10:51] <Wilto> Ugh ugh that should’ve been “merged branch hurr hurr.Æ
[15:10:56] <Wilto> I’m a mess with these commits today.
[15:10:59] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #59: FAILURE in 16 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/59/
[15:10:59] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Moved  function to outside each loop, to prevent it from being redefined each time the controlgroup widget is called.
[15:11:00] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Added ���mini��� form widget options, optional background on slider widgets.
[15:11:00] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Refined `mini` widget styles; added mini collapsibles/collapsible sets.
[15:11:01] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Now using the same `ui-mini` class for minified (heh) elements of any type.
[15:11:01] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Added mini buttons at the controlgroup level.
[15:11:02] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Quick test to ensure .ui-mini class is applied correctly to buttonMarkup elements and associated controlgroups.
[15:11:02] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Added mini version of toggle switch; ensured slider handles (which are handled the same as buttons) were unaffected by parent controlgroups.
[15:11:03] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Added mini form element gallery. Adorable.
[15:11:03] <jq-jenkins> * mat: Updated /forms pages��� navigation with link to new mini form gallery page.
[15:11:06] <Wilto> oh
[15:11:23] <Wilto> On it.
[15:18:08] <johnbender> Wilto: different build
[15:18:09] <johnbender> one sec
[15:18:59] <johnbender> gseguin: build broke on closure warning
[15:23:01] <Wilto> Well, I do have a failing test, but I’m not sure why.
[15:36:26] <gseguin> johnbender: I noticed
[15:42:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #450: SUCCESS in 27 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/450/
[15:43:08] <gseguin> Yippie!
[15:43:32] <johnbender> gseguin: that's the test suite build
[15:44:06] <gseguin> johnbender: you're a joy killer
[15:44:09] <gseguin> :P
[15:44:47] <johnbender> gseguin: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/59/
[15:45:00] <gseguin> ouch
[15:45:17] <johnbender> gseguin: seems odd to me that the line number in jquery.mobile.js is 4000 is it trying to compile an already compiled file?
[15:46:07] <gseguin> hmm strange indeed
[15:46:38] * gseguin dives in
[15:53:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the latest build is broken, just a heads up
[15:55:03] <gseguin> johnbender: jqadmin@swarm-01:/var/lib/jenkins/jobs/jQuery Mobile Latest/workspace$ cat compiled/jquery.mobile.js | wc -l
[15:55:03] <gseguin> 7190
[15:55:18] <gseguin> oops
[15:56:50] <johnbender> gseguin: `wc -l` can take a file argument fyi
[15:57:00] <johnbender> gseguin: but that makes sense doesn't it
[15:57:12] <johnbender> that's the concated version of the js
[15:57:20] <johnbender> and closure minifies it
[15:57:54] <gseguin> oh
[15:57:57] <gseguin> I know
[15:58:02] <gseguin> trailing comma
[15:58:06] <johnbender> right
[15:58:07] <gseguin> DAMMIT WILTO
[15:59:54] <johnbender> gseguin: it looks fine to my eyebal
[15:59:57] <johnbender> and js2-mode agrees
[16:00:21] <gseguin> oh no it looks fine to me too
[16:00:41] <johnbender> did we find a bug in the closure compiler linter?
[16:00:42] <gseguin> but looks like closure compilier is IE6-like
[16:01:46] <johnbender> gseguin: total side note but couldn't those just be ||'s?
[16:02:05] <johnbender> unless "" or 0 are valid values
[16:02:25] <gseguin> what's the module?
[16:02:35] <johnbender> buttonMakrup
[16:02:39] <johnbender> *markUP
[16:02:40] <gseguin> oh roght
[16:02:41] <johnbender> zomg
[16:02:42] <gseguin> right
[16:02:46] <johnbender> buttonMarkup
[16:03:20] <gseguin> yeah || would work here
[16:03:45] <gseguin> actually
[16:03:58] <gseguin> is $.extend destructive?
[16:04:07] <gseguin> I don't think it is
[16:04:14] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[16:04:26] <johnbender> lawl
[16:04:35] <johnbender> dunno but that's a good point
[16:05:13] <gseguin> $.extend( options, blah ) would work I think
[16:05:22] <gseguin> let me fix that trailing comma first
[16:05:29] <johnbender> right
[16:06:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gseguin pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/VGDb1Q
[16:06:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Removed trailing comma - Ghislain Seguin
[16:08:02] <gseguin> man that /test build is fast :D
[16:10:17] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[16:10:18] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #60: FIXED in 3 min 7 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/60/
[16:10:18] <jq-jenkins> Ghislain Seguin: Removed trailing comma
[16:10:32] <gseguin> Yay!
[16:12:39] * johnbender goes to look at the commit
[16:13:38] <johnbender> gseguin: gdamn it, I wasn't up to date when I looked
[16:13:46] <gseguin> heh
[16:13:48] <johnbender> js2-mode is glowing orange at that there comma
[16:14:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: build is working again
[16:15:04] <johnbender> gseguin: yah for doing the build in jenkins (irc + email)
[16:15:18] <johnbender> gseguin: I started playing around with buildbot last night
[16:15:30] <gseguin> what about travis-ci ?
[16:15:33] <johnbender> clearly not going to switch on this project (UI is using jenkins too
[16:15:39] <johnbender> gseguin: yah we could set that up
[16:15:52] <johnbender> don't see why we should given that we have it set up for ourselves
[16:16:02] <johnbender> just need to make the results public
[16:22:10] <gseguin> $.extend is destructive
[16:22:35] <gseguin> but stil there is a way to make it less wordy I think
[16:23:08] <johnbender> gseguin: for sure
[16:23:51] <johnbender> gseguin: it looks like it wants to prefer the options
[16:24:01] <gseguin> yup
[16:24:52] <gseguin> so this: https://gist.github.com/841b1ef1495b4a4efe81
[16:24:58] <johnbender> gseguin: worst case == function defaultToDataAttrs( prop ) { return options[prop] !== undefined ? options[prop] : el.jqmData(prop) }
[16:24:58] <gseguin> could work
[16:25:20] <johnbender> yah that's what i was thinking in the case where 0 or "" aren't valid values
[16:25:37] <johnbender> the above function foces the undefined check if not
[16:26:01] <gseguin> yep
[16:26:04] <johnbender> assuming options is closed over
[16:26:33] <johnbender> alright I need to run to the store to get some dayquil while my nanny is still around
[16:26:48] <gseguin> I have to write a test for that $this -> $page change I was telling you earlier
[16:27:01] <gseguin> alright
[16:27:05] <johnbender> shweet
[16:27:05] <gseguin> I'll catch you later
[16:27:16] <gseguin> I'll put that code clean up on a shelf
[16:27:36] <johnbender> gseguin: yah, maybe just shoot Wilto  the gist for reference
[16:28:06] <gseguin> k
[16:42:57] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #451: SUCCESS in 27 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/451/
[17:17:04] <Wilto> Oh you’re kidding.
[17:17:12] <Wilto> _Trailing comma_?
[17:17:31] <gseguin> good ol' memories, heh :D
[17:18:30] <gseguin> Wilto: looks like google is using IE6's JS engine for their Closure compiler
[17:19:43] <Wilto> Man. I’m gonna have to get my W3Schools certificate renewed.
[17:19:51] <Wilto> Amateur hour up in here.
[17:19:53] <gseguin> lol
[17:20:07] <Wilto> Sorry about that, guys.
[17:20:17] <gseguin> no worries
[17:23:55] <johnbender> Wilto: no worries man
[17:23:59] <johnbender> what editor do you use?
[17:24:47] <gseguin> I bet ya vi or something nerdy like that :D
[17:24:50] <Wilto> …TextMate.
[17:24:55] <Wilto> Whitespace, huh.
[17:24:57] <gseguin> oh man I lost!
[17:25:37] <Wilto> It throws tabs all over the place.
[17:25:56] <gseguin> did you give a try to sublime text 2?
[17:26:02] <gseguin> very very neat
[17:26:06] <gseguin> and super fast
[17:26:19] <gseguin> and works on osx, linux and windows
[17:26:26] <gseguin> and it's only $60
[17:26:31] <gseguin> wait WAT ?
[17:26:39] <Wilto> I tried it for a while. Switched back when TextMate 2 came out.
[17:26:55] <Wilto> It’s good and all, but it _crawls_ on big projects.
[17:27:07] <gseguin> oh does it?
[17:27:16] <Wilto> Yeah, I dunno what the deal is.
[17:27:18] <gseguin> I use webstorm on big projects
[17:27:36] <gseguin> it crawls too but it's ok, it's an IDE
[17:29:28] <Wilto> I dunno; I think I’m sticking with TM for sentimental value.
[17:30:42] <Wilto> I still have a MacHeist serial number in there from like five years ago, under someone else’s name.
[17:33:08] <johnbender> Wilto: http://andrewdupont.net/2006/10/01/javascript-tools-textmate-bundle/
[17:33:11] <johnbender> googled
[17:33:30] <johnbender> gseguin: did our pre-commit hook catch the trailing comma?
[17:33:39] <gseguin> don't think so
[17:33:44] <johnbender> better question: is that even a setting in jshint?
[17:33:55] <gseguin> I believe so
[17:34:46] <johnbender> gseguin: we should make that a task for ourselves
[17:35:03] <johnbender> get the code base in good shape for our hint config
[17:35:14] <gseguin> I think the closure compiler does a fine job at finding them
[17:35:23] <johnbender> and then get everyone on board with a pre-commit hook that prevents the commit on hint issues
[17:35:41] <gseguin> but yeah that sounds like a good idea
[17:35:50] <johnbender> gseguin: we talked about doing that when we set it up
[17:35:58] <Wilto> Ooh.
[17:36:40] <gseguin> but how would you run jshint? through the no.de service?
[17:37:08] <johnbender> gseguin: yah? in the pre commit hook eh?
[17:37:30] <gseguin> that means that you need to be online when you do your commit
[17:37:31] <johnbender> gseguin: we could also just make it part of the build
[17:37:45] <johnbender> gseguin: we had this discussion when we created the ting
[17:37:47] <johnbender> *thing
[17:37:59] <gseguin> I think part of the build is a better idea
[17:38:01] <johnbender> it checks for a connection
[17:38:11] <gseguin> oh that's right
[17:38:38] <johnbender> gseguin: it's better to have it pre-commit because then the offender is required to deal with it
[17:38:50] <johnbender> hmm
[17:39:09] <johnbender> unless we made it a part of the test suite build and ran it as an actual assertion
[17:39:10] <gseguin> true
[17:39:19] <johnbender> still there's a leap
[17:39:36] <gseguin> commit -n
[17:39:44] <johnbender> alright I need to go relieve my nanny
