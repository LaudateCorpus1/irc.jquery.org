[05:22:47] <sven_franck> any earlybirds around?
[07:11:26] <Wilto> Mornin’, guys.
[07:45:13] <toddmparker_> hey all
[07:49:06] <Wilto> ’Sup.
[07:51:03] <sven_franck> hey
[07:51:14] <Wilto> Yo.
[07:52:42] <sven_franck> Wilto: question
[07:52:58] <sven_franck> can I trigger('create') on a page I insert?
[07:53:07] <sven_franck> I can, but nothing happens...
[07:53:13] <sven_franck> :-(
[07:53:38] <Wilto> “pagecreate?”
[07:53:49] <sven_franck> error =
[07:53:52] <sven_franck> 1sec
[07:55:10] <sven_franck> if I call "pagecreate" > $page.data( "page" ) is undefined, if I call "create" $from.data("page") is undefined...
[07:55:27] <sven_franck> stuck in the middle
[07:56:57] <sven_franck> Wilto: ...fromPage... on the first transition I'm trying to make
[07:59:08] <Wilto> Not ringin’ any bells at a glance; I’d have to dig into it a little.
[08:01:26] <sven_franck> ok.
[08:02:23] <sven_franck> Wilto: I stumbled upon it, cause I had a page() leftover in my plugin and I have been trying ever since to mimic what page() did before using available functions.
[08:09:07] <Wilto> You wanna just throw that in the issue tracker for the time being, sven_franck?
[08:09:18] <sven_franck> just did
[08:11:21] <Wilto> ?hi5
[08:11:21] <bot-t> ⁵
[08:38:15] <johnbender> got a github message from a guy asking for help
[08:38:17] <johnbender> I helped him
[08:38:34] <Wilto> With you so far.
[08:38:41] <johnbender> and in the process spotted the most massive and scarry sql injection bug I've ever seen
[08:38:46] <johnbender> "bug" is really generous too
[08:39:02] <johnbender> the *javascript* is just a portal to the database
[08:39:14] <johnbender> scarry stuff
[08:40:04] <Wilto> Wait.
[08:40:07] <Wilto> _What?_
[08:41:12] <johnbender> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2356
[08:41:13] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by johnpeb (2m, 3w ago): Allow full width search inputs
[08:41:16] <johnbender> unrelated
[08:41:36] <johnbender> wondering if you or toddmparker_ can take a look at that one
[08:41:39] <Wilto> Oh. I was like “oh god are we doing that somehow oh no oh no.”
[08:42:06] <Wilto> Sure thing.
[08:43:00] <toddmparker_> guess i'm confused, they look full width here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/search/
[08:43:43] <Wilto> Yeah. I’m worried they have it in a fieldcontain and they’re overriding the style set intentionally.
[08:44:22] <Wilto> Actually, I don’t know what this guy is doing.
[08:45:30] <toddmparker_> i just commented on the pull and in the forum. that is an ancient issue and we fixed this for 1.0
[08:45:48] <toddmparker_> i didn't close quite yet in case i missed something
[08:56:10] <gseguin> 'morning all
[09:13:03] <gseguin> toddmparker_: should we do the repo shrinking?
[09:13:34] <toddmparker_> i'd like to talk to johnbender and kinbls about that - guys, you here?
[09:14:49] <gseguin> sure, not the kind of thing I want to do without multiple blessings ;)
[09:18:10] <johnbender> yah
[09:18:18] <johnbender> I'll be totally frank
[09:18:25] <johnbender> I don't think there's any value in doing it
[09:18:37] <johnbender> it only matters on your first pull
[09:18:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: ^
[09:19:00] <gseguin> point taken
[09:19:19] <johnbender> and I don't want to deal with all the possibly weirdness it might cause
[09:19:22] <johnbender> not only for contribs
[09:19:28] <gseguin> I'm not going to argue that it is something we can't go forward without
[09:19:45] <Wilto> I think I’m with you, johnbender. I mean, it’s kinda goofy on the initial pull, but… “If it ain’t broke” and all.
[09:19:45] <gseguin> it's just kind of a pain for the cloning indeed
[09:20:12] <johnbender> and it clearly isn't stopping people from forking the repo
[09:20:41] <johnbender> has anyone external complained about it ?
[09:21:09] <toddmparker_> i haven't seen anything on twitter or whatever
[09:21:17] * johnbender shrugs
[09:21:21] <johnbender> yak shaving
[09:21:29] <toddmparker_> agree that this isn't stopping people. we have a ton of forks
[09:21:33] <toddmparker_> heh
[09:21:42] <gseguin> alright, done with that then
[09:21:48] <gseguin> next issue
[09:22:35] <Wilto> …“Yak shaving.”
[09:22:48] <gseguin> toddmparker_: anything hot I should look at or should I continue my AMD work ?
[09:23:22] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ping
[09:23:43] <toddmparker_> pong
[09:24:21] <toddmparker_> gseguin: i think you can keep going on. i'd like to get that hased out and have you work on the dep. map so we cna be readyf ro a downlao dbuilder
[09:24:36] <toddmparker_> what's up kinblas
[09:24:51] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so I wanted to share something interesting ... I basically took the approach yesterday of trying to recreate the listview pages that blink
[09:24:58] <kinblas> pulling in only styles I needed
[09:25:03] <Wilto> “Yak shaving” has just replaced “bike shedding” as my favorite dev term.
[09:25:06] <kinblas> and damnit things are relatively smooth
[09:25:12] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/bikeshed.jpg
[09:25:14] <toddmparker_> yeah??
[09:25:43] <kinblas> toddmparker_: there's something withing the CSS at large that I'm missing that is contributing to the blinkiness ... I'm still searchin'
[09:25:53] <toddmparker_> yeah? cool.
[09:26:15] <toddmparker_> is the blink mainly android?
[09:26:43] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm only looking at android at the moment
[09:27:21] <kinblas> I said relatively smooth because there is a slight blink on start, but it's not as jarring as the one at the end where the previous page shows and then disappears
[09:27:39] <kinblas> I shouldn't say blink ... it's more of a flicker
[09:27:54] <kinblas> and it usually only happens the first time you transition to that page, all other times are smooth
[09:28:34] <johnbender> oh snap
[09:30:17] <toddmparker_> encouraging
[09:31:01] <toddmparker_> so on android, things are especially bad because of the rendering blink + the scroll jump - together, these look pretty bad
[09:31:24] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah the scrolling part is especially bad because the rendering is slow to begin with
[09:31:47] <kinblas> but things still blink even when we don't scroll ... I have it all commented out in my tree
[09:31:53] <kinblas> and it still flickers like a bo-flicker
[09:37:12] <toddmparker_> meh
[09:37:25] <toddmparker_> what if we just exclude android from transitions
[09:37:31] <toddmparker_> or just use fade :)
[09:38:01] <Wilto> I don’t know that we have any (easy) way of calling out Android, do we?
[09:38:50] <Wilto> They should really add, like, “window.thisbrowsersucks” to check against.
[09:39:19] <sven_franck> Wilto::-D
[09:39:30] <toddmparker_> +1
[09:39:45] <toddmparker_> kinblas: maybe focus is an issue here? see this bug: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2856#issuecomment-2851693
[09:39:49] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2856 on jquery-mobile, reported by ggear (3w, 6d ago): Slide page transition causes screen repaint on iOS 5 chromeless
[09:40:35] <toddmparker_> Calling the focus() method on the ui-title within the reFocus() function causes the white block to appear when sliding in from the right. You can see this happening if you hardcode JS alerts before and after the focus() call. If the focus() call is commented out, no flickering occurs.
[09:40:39] <kinblas> focus causes offset rendering if the item that is being focused is not in the view
[09:40:49] <kinblas> but in this specific case it's all CSS
[09:40:58] <kinblas> I'm not even running any jqm js
[09:41:04] <kinblas> and I still get the same results
[09:41:09] <Wilto> Hm.
[09:41:23] <Wilto> Anything looking likely? box-shadows, gradients?
[09:41:29] <Wilto> If I had to guess, it’s gradients.
[09:41:56] <kinblas> Wilto: it certainly seemed that way initially, as wells as text-overflow:ellipsis
[09:42:08] <kinblas> but as I mentioned earlier I built the listview samples I'm using by hand
[09:42:18] <Wilto> I’m gonna throw this out there, too: it’s pretty safe to assume non-prefixed box-shadow support in the modern browsers. Removing the prefixed rules would omit it from Android.
[09:42:20] <kinblas> ... using only what was necessary ot visually replicate
[09:42:25] <kinblas> and I don't get the flashing
[09:42:29] <kinblas> so something else is at play
[09:42:35] <Wilto> Hm.
[09:43:59] <Wilto> Well, y’know, that thing I threw out there is remaining out there. One less thing to potentially send Android screaming into the woods.
[09:55:12] <toddmparker_> mysterious
[09:56:06] <toddmparker_> when i was testing perf, i deleted every gradient rule in my css and it didn't have as much impact as i thought on scrolling so maybe it's not that bad
[09:56:13] <Wilto> “The game is afoot.”
[09:56:15] <toddmparker_> border-radius was slow
[09:56:29] <toddmparker_> anyway kinblas, keep digging
[09:57:26] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah but I'm seeing this flashing on pure listview pages with no border-radius
[09:59:48] <toddmparker_> so do you have two static pages each with listviews that you're animating
[09:59:59] <toddmparker_> no jqm at all
[10:06:04] <toddmparker_> hey all - been thinking a lot about mutli-views and such and i'm proposing we think about giving our links a lot more power by leveraging the ajax nav model we already have
[10:06:14] <toddmparker_> hard to explain it all, but jotted some notes down here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.next-planning
[10:06:29] <toddmparker_> halfway down, "Ajax include pattern"
[10:06:46] <toddmparker_> In a nutshell: add the ability to point to local (#) or external (page.html) content fragments (load ="my-selector") then either throw that into an overlay (rel=popup) or use the content to update something within the page (target="selector"). Choose whether these should be history tracked and deep-linkable.
[10:07:19] <toddmparker_> sven_franck, looking for your thoughts on this
[10:07:26] <Wilto> I am cooking something up for this as we speak.
[10:07:31] <toddmparker_> borrowed some ideas from you
[10:07:34] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: 1sec
[10:07:43] <toddmparker_> yeah @wilto is doing some code sketches
[10:07:45] <Wilto> Something prototype-y; not worked into jQM or anything.
[10:07:48] <toddmparker_> no rush
[10:09:42] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: I like, thinking this through now
[10:10:04] <toddmparker_> just trying to do the least, but have open-ended tools
[10:10:27] <sven_franck> so this would mean you would have a history for "sections of code"?
[10:10:49] <toddmparker_> take these link ideas, add in some media query responsive layouts, and a scroller and you're golden
[10:11:09] <toddmparker_> maybe a typo sven_franck
[10:11:12] <toddmparker_> where?
[10:12:26] <sven_franck> on the phone...
[10:23:00] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: ok, back.
[10:23:02] <sven_franck> So from what I understand you either grab on site (#someList) or external (anotherpage.html#someList) content-section and drop it in popup or replace a current content section?
[10:23:27] <sven_franck> history = make it reversible?
[10:24:10] <toddmparker_> yes, history would need to make it reversable
[10:24:20] <toddmparker_> not sure how tricky that bit is
[10:24:21] <sven_franck> understand
[10:24:31] <sven_franck> hm... tricky :-)
[10:24:41] <toddmparker_> so these are additions to the current page nav stuff
[10:24:53] <toddmparker_> you can sill just link to a page and it will work as now
[10:25:14] <toddmparker_> could just be that we don't expose that option
[10:25:32] <toddmparker_> and just make popups/dialogs have the back by default
[10:25:41] <toddmparker_> and skip it for random content updates
[10:26:07] <sven_franck> ok
[10:26:18] <toddmparker_> but in the case of the multi-view, would you want to go back through the steps - view message 1, 5, 8
[10:26:32] <toddmparker_> which i why i thought it might be worth doing, even if hard
[10:26:37] <sven_franck> I'm doing this right now in my plugin
[10:26:37] <toddmparker_> not sure
[10:26:44] <toddmparker_> right
[10:26:52] <toddmparker_> but it's been tricky, right?
[10:27:17] <sven_franck> you need to make some rules
[10:27:23] <sven_franck> for example:
[10:28:02] <sven_franck> I'm saying popovers always go first before background content, so when a user opens a popover and goes 5 pages deep in it then starts clicking back button
[10:28:26] <sven_franck> I "unwind" the popover first, then when it's back to base, I let JQM take over
[10:29:03] <sven_franck> I'm basically keeping history stacks for all panels
[10:29:43] <sven_franck> the logic works ok now, still aligning with window.history
[10:30:15] <sven_franck> but you could use it for any type of content with a few tweaks
[10:30:45] <sven_franck> the tricky parts have been =
[10:31:13] <sven_franck> menu & main stack needing to move together
[10:31:29] <sven_franck> reversing context-loading
[10:31:30] <toddmparker_> makes sense
[10:31:32] <sven_franck> and back-button
[10:31:50] <toddmparker_> i think you experience with this will be a huge help
[10:32:21] <sven_franck> :-)
[10:33:19] <sven_franck> I'm commenting through my plugin, so if someone reads it more or less knows what's supposed to happen on each line.
[10:33:19] <toddmparker_> seems like giving devs the option to include an action in history or not is a good idea because it really is a design decision of what action is significant enough (or valid) to store as a history state
[10:33:47] <sven_franck> I have data-hash="history" and data-hash="crumbs"
[10:33:56] <toddmparker_> for example, you may open a popover and navigate within, but you want the back button to just close it, not unwind each step
[10:34:08] <sven_franck> crumbs = back button
[10:34:10] <toddmparker_> yeah, saw that
[10:34:41] <toddmparker_> i wan't sure the difference. are both the same history-wise, but crumbs add a back button in the ui?
[10:34:44] <sven_franck> you could add a "skip" option
[10:35:11] <sven_franck> crumbs also gives you a back button, while history just has the browser-back-button
[10:35:20] <toddmparker_> right.
[10:35:39] <sven_franck> like on cross-panel transitions, normal back-button, didn't work
[10:35:55] <toddmparker_> i sort of feel like we could do the bare minimum and maybe eventually support things like breadcrumbs
[10:36:14] <toddmparker_> but you could get by without it if you just added the button yourself int he markup
[10:36:30] <sven_franck> Haven't tried, but this should be made possible
[10:36:49] <toddmparker_> but are you saying that these don't both use the same history logic?
[10:37:29] <sven_franck> they should, cause... I'm checking for panel-stack-height on changePage and hashChange
[10:37:32] <toddmparker_> i guess I'm leaning towards not be prescriptive in the design at all. you may have a popup that is drillable but doesn't have a top bar
[10:37:54] <toddmparker_> so we just treat things as containers that we can drop stuff into
[10:38:23] <sven_franck> k
[10:38:36] <toddmparker_> start by doing the least with little tools. you may make a demo that looks just like your multi-view though
[10:38:50] <sven_franck> ok
[10:38:58] <sven_franck> any specific wishes for the demo?
[10:47:14] <toddmparker_> so sven_franck remind me what you're working on. i know we just discussed this yesterday
[10:49:33] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: polishing plugin = making sure that you can have two multiview pages in the DOM (first one loaded, 2nd pulled in),
[10:50:10] <toddmparker_> cool
[10:50:43] <sven_franck> I spent the last day wondering why everything blanked out if I go: Panel-Page>JQM-page>Panel-Page
[10:51:04] <toddmparker_> i would like to try and get us all to huddle on a separate thread to see what ideas/code we can pull from your work into a smaller set of tools like that ajax links at some point too
[10:51:23] <toddmparker_> the key is to figure out a good api and feature set
[10:51:54] <sven_franck> we can still do the run-through through the code and demo if you want
[10:52:16] <toddmparker_> sven_franck: i was wondering, how does this work on a smartphone? i see the layout adapts which is cool, but is all the panel content loaded?
[10:52:26] <sven_franck> yup
[10:52:35] <sven_franck> panel goes above content
[10:52:52] <sven_franck> = if you open a popover on smartphone, it will be a fullscreen page
[10:53:03] <sven_franck> added blinky pop transition yesterday ;-)
[10:53:10] <toddmparker_> trying to figure out how to make that more mobile -first
[10:53:37] <toddmparker_> like load up the thing you will see, then lazy load in the panels that aren't visible later or only when seen
[10:53:45] <toddmparker_> ah, transitions
[10:54:04] <sven_franck> you can do both = start with an empty container or
[10:54:11] <sven_franck> already have pages in it
[10:56:14] <toddmparker_> so what if you wanted the primary content container loaded up-front because you'll see that
[10:56:47] <toddmparker_> but the leftnav and popovers loaded in only if on a tablet or if you open then on a phone?
[10:56:58] <toddmparker_> sorry if i'm asking dumb questions
[11:59:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: WIlto: ok I think I found the source of the problem
[11:59:08] <kinblas> for transition blinking
[11:59:17] <kinblas> of the from page at the end
[11:59:28] <Wilto> This is serious business.
[11:59:31] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[11:59:40] <kinblas> Wilto: it's your good friend overflow-x
[11:59:49] <kinblas> on ui-content
[11:59:49] <toddmparker_> bah
[11:59:55] <Wilto> ANNNN-DROIIID!
[12:00:00] <toddmparker_> that is causing fits on android
[12:00:09] <kinblas> if I remove that there is no flashing of previous content
[12:00:18] <toddmparker_> woah
[12:00:20] * kinblas verifies in the jquerymobile tree
[12:00:23] <Wilto> http://idontwanttoliveonthisplanetanymore.com/
[12:01:39] <Wilto> Alright. So, it’s out. No mas.
[12:02:06] <Wilto> Way the hell more trouble than it’s worth.
[12:02:09] <toddmparker_> what, android?
[12:02:14] <kinblas> Let me do more testing, but I just went through the exercise of introducing the structure step by step
[12:02:21] <kinblas> and that is the one property that triggers it
[12:02:28] <Wilto> Hah, I wish.
[12:02:32] <kinblas> toddmparker_: i'm testing on 2.1
[12:02:33] <Wilto> Figures.
[12:02:47] <Wilto> Android wiles out on overflow: anything anywhere.
[12:02:53] <toddmparker_> you got 2.2 or 2.3 too
[12:03:15] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I have 2.2 but I didn't see the problem on the droidX
[12:03:48] <toddmparker_> what about puffy 'comb
[12:04:18] <Wilto> P-Droid-y.
[12:04:58] <sven_franck> (applauding kinblas)
[12:05:53] <Wilto> Yeah, no doubt—awesome detective work, kinblas.
[12:06:20] <sven_franck> sherlock
[12:09:09] <toddmparker_> waiting to see if this really fixes it in jQM...
[12:13:35] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/wait.gif
[12:23:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: Wilto: bah, there's another trigger in the rest of the CSS
[12:23:30] <kinblas> if I add the entire CSS, and then comment out that one overflow-x: things still blink ... so there's another trigger somewhere else in the CSS
[12:23:51] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/argh.gif
[12:23:59] <Wilto> (That uses up my .gif quota for the day.)
[12:24:18] <kinblas> heh
[12:24:21] <Wilto> I’m willing to bet it’s another instance of overflow.
[12:24:37] <kinblas> yeah there's one on the viewport
[12:24:48] <kinblas> but I had that in there in my smaller test case
[12:24:54] <kinblas> which was using just what was needed
[12:25:01] <kinblas> I'll comment it out
[12:25:02] <kinblas> :-)
[12:26:36] <toddmparker_> so....
[12:29:01] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so ... I think I have to continue methodically adding CSS until it starts flashing again, then I can see what the next culprit is ... sigh ... this is sooooo tedious ...
[12:29:13] * kinblas increments sample-15
[12:29:26] <toddmparker_> fun
[12:29:36] <toddmparker_> so it's still flashing
[12:30:24] <toddmparker_> if this is mainly just tinkering with css, you could document what you're doing an I or Mat could play around
[12:30:28] <toddmparker_> happy to help
[12:30:43] <Wilto> Yeah, absolutely.
[12:30:53] <kinblas> I can send you guys my samples
[12:31:04] <kinblas> I have an index.html that explains each sample step
[12:31:04] <Wilto> You know I love me some weird CSS issues.
[12:31:13] <Wilto> Sweet; yeah. Fire away.
[12:31:14] <kinblas> I'll zip and email
[12:31:15] <toddmparker_> yeah, it's Wilto's fav
[12:31:20] <toddmparker_> cool
[12:31:31] <Wilto> For some values of “favorite.”
[12:31:43] <toddmparker_> the other half of this is revamping the animations to avoid the honkin' loader and hide the scroll jump
[12:32:03] <toddmparker_> and maybe dusting off the branch with transitions
[12:32:25] <toddmparker_> but i'd like to prototype different transitions first
[12:32:36] <toddmparker_> sort of like my demo
[12:35:03] <kinblas> Wilto: toddmparker_: I just sent it to you guys ... any includes with ../../jquery-mobile are just to my local HEAD tree with no changes.
[12:35:38] <kinblas> most just require jquery core
[12:35:43] <sven_franck> kinblas: wilto: if you are talking about: body.ui-mobile-viewport { overflow-x: hidden;} I would welcome a the pre1.0 modification :-) ... I'm missing my popover-triangles :-(
[12:36:27] <kinblas> sven_franck: that broke something for you?
[12:36:33] <sven_franck> yup
[12:37:12] <sven_franck> panels get div.ui-mobile-viewport, so overflow-x:hidden
[12:37:33] <sven_franck> I had popovers "out-of-bounds", which are now invisible
[12:37:41] <sven_franck> (thinking about a nicer way to say this)
[12:37:55] <sven_franck> popover-triangles I mean
[12:39:30] <kinblas> sven_franck: at least in this case, the overflow-x in question was on .ui-content
[12:39:31] <johnbender> sven_franck: sadly that breaks our native select menu on android
[12:39:42] <kinblas> whack-a-mole
[12:39:45] <sven_franck> IC
[12:39:46] <johnbender> kinblas: seriously
[12:40:16] <sven_franck> I have not looked into a workaround though.
[12:40:18] <sven_franck> I was happy I found them....
[12:40:26] <sven_franck> triangles hiding
[13:01:11] <Wilto> Oh, johnbender, dropping overflow-x shouldn’t break selects.
[13:01:51] <Wilto> We just had to add some Shenanigans™ to prevent overflow-x from applying to strange and exotic elements like <form> and <td>, or the selects blew up on Android.
[13:02:54] <Wilto> Everything that is soulless and wrong about the Android browser boils down to “weird about overflow” and “weird about focus.”
[13:03:52] <toddmparker_> Wilto is making good progress on a prototype for the ajax include idea. so slick and tiny codebase
[13:04:39] <sven_franck> toddmparker_ can read between the lines?
[13:04:46] <toddmparker_> ?
[13:04:49] <sven_franck> of Wilto :-)
[13:05:10] <toddmparker_> this is just the little doodad to load stuff in
[13:05:21] <Wilto> wat
[13:05:29] <sven_franck> nevermind...
[13:21:48] <Wilto> I think I missed something.
[13:22:27] <Wilto> kinblas, where you at on tracking that down? I can dig into this zip file in a few, if it helps at all.
[13:22:59] <kinblas> Wilto: I'm still incrementally addings tuff
[13:23:22] <kinblas> stuff
[13:23:27] <gseguin> johnbender: ping
[13:23:44] <kinblas> btw I may sign off early today
[13:24:04] <kinblas> perhaps around 3pm-ish
[13:24:37] <Wilto> jQUERY MOBILE HAS NO HOLIDAYS KIN
[13:25:02] <toddmparker_> yeah ^^
[13:25:15] <Wilto> I mean, that’s what toddmparker_ said to me, anyway. They’re locking me in over the weekend.
[13:25:25] <Wilto> That happens to everyone though, right..?
[13:25:26] <toddmparker_> and kinblas - 2.1 is the only place where you can clearly see a blink?
[13:25:30] <kinblas> Wilto: ok then I guess I'll see you at the meeting TOMORROW then?
[13:25:36] <kinblas> :-)
[13:25:52] <toddmparker_> it's normal to live in a cage under your desk Wilto, trust me
[13:26:04] <toddmparker_> yep, right at dinner time
[13:26:08] <kinblas> toddmparker_: let me try the Droid X (2.2) on my samples
[13:26:08] <Wilto> 2:00 tomorrow? I’ll be the drunk one wearing an apron.
[13:26:12] <kinblas> I couldn't repro with the selects page
[13:26:14] <toddmparker_> k
[13:26:23] <kinblas> Wilto: heh ... and nothing else
[13:26:33] <Wilto> And a smile, kinblas. And a smile.
[13:26:39] <kinblas> lol
[13:27:14] <gseguin> :)
[13:28:15] <toddmparker_> so are you looking at the 2.1 blink as a way to understand android's weaknesses?
[13:28:32] <toddmparker_> not too worried if just 2.1 is a little blinky
[13:29:11] <kinblas> toddmparker_: well that blink was part of some bug
[13:29:16] <kinblas> with the selects page
[13:29:19] <toddmparker_> i see
[13:29:24] <kinblas> and I could only repro on my 2.1
[13:29:31] <toddmparker_> gotcha
[13:29:39] <kinblas> I think whoever filed it said they could repro on other versions
[13:29:57] <toddmparker_> but, big picture, we're trying to figure out what css or js stuff to avoid
[13:30:33] <kinblas> right
[13:31:41] <toddmparker_> ok
[13:31:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 7 new commits to master: http://git.io/scPiMw
[13:31:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Add slider step support from jQuery UI - jrowny
[13:31:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] add slider step support from jQuery UI - jrowny
[13:31:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] slider step, remove round clean up code a bit - jrowny
[13:42:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto if you guys get a free moment it would be good to get a bit of testing on stepped sliders
[13:42:40] <johnbender> I'm going to added an example to the docs
[13:43:58] <Wilto> Sure thing.
[13:47:23] <kinblas> Wilto: toddmparker_: so as I do this I think the slowness also has to do with the number of rules ... for example, I can take the sample where things work fine, and just add the rules for more swatches and I can repro
[13:47:32] <kinblas> take away swatches d and e which aren't used at all
[13:47:35] <kinblas> and the problem goes away
[13:47:45] <Wilto> …
[13:48:01] <Wilto> AH-HAH.
[13:48:19] <Wilto> It’s re-parsing all the CSS on every redraw.
[13:48:33] <kinblas> complexity = reflow complexity + css resolution
[13:48:41] <Wilto> That is the only thing I could possibly imagine.
[13:49:40] <toddmparker_> that is bizarre
[13:49:55] <Wilto> I mean… That can’t be, can it?
[13:49:56] <toddmparker_> so if you add 15 swatches, does it go to hell?
[13:50:07] <toddmparker_> that would really prove the theory, right?
[13:50:26] <toddmparker_> go to TR, make a theme with 26 swatches, download
[13:50:38] <toddmparker_> paste into theme.css
[13:53:25] <Wilto> I like where you’re at.
[13:53:33] <Wilto> When in doubt, break it more.
[13:53:36] <kinblas> toddmparker_: Wilto: at this point 5 is enough :-P
[13:53:53] <kinblas> I remove D + E and I can't repro
[13:54:02] <kinblas> and D+E are *NOT* used at all
[13:54:14] <toddmparker_> der.
[13:54:47] <toddmparker_> put a few more in, just for kicks
[13:55:18] <Wilto> Plus, it’s cathartic, in a way. “You wanna break so bad, Android!? TAKE THIS.”
[13:57:14] <johnbender> I imagine at some point in the distant future where we end support for 2.x in android I'll take the time to have an "Office space" moment with an android phone
[13:57:39] <Wilto> I’ll bring the bat.
[13:58:52] <toddmparker_> let's get OG on 2.1
[13:59:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: step attribute added to first slide docs example
[14:00:02] <Wilto> Sweet.
[14:00:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/KTAs0Q
[14:00:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] whitespace in slider docs index - John Bender
[14:00:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] add step to slider example - John Bender
[14:00:17] <johnbender> didn't make sense to add a different slider just for that so I just rolled it in there
[14:01:28] <Wilto> Works for me.
[14:01:37] <sven_franck> done for tonight. CU
[14:16:11] <Wilto> Step is lookin’ good from here, johnbender.
[14:18:40] <johnbender> Wilto: great
[14:18:50] <johnbender> yah the change was relatively simple but I was worred about interactions on phones
[14:19:22] <toddmparker_> looks good
[14:19:30] <Wilto> Oh, I haven’t checked it across the assorted gadgetry yet.
[14:19:46] <toddmparker_> think we should mention this in the docs so people know what it does, the demo works like a charm
[14:23:24] <Wilto> Testin’ on WP7 now.
[14:23:36] <Wilto> “If you make it there, you’ll make it anywhere.”
[14:24:12] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #305: SUCCESS in 14 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/305/

[14:29:06] <Wilto> Lookin’ as good as anything ever does on WP7.
[14:29:37] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/mad-decent.gif
[14:41:45] <kinblas> Wilto: wow, just confirmed it's not what's in the rule, but the number
[14:41:57] <kinblas> I just replaced all of the 'd' and 'e' rules with color: black
[14:42:03] <kinblas> and it still happens
[14:42:09] <kinblas> remove the rules and the problem goes away
[14:42:47] <kinblas> btw, I tried empty rules too, but I think they get optimized out
[14:43:00] <kinblas> hence the use of color:black
[14:45:50] <Wilto> I don’t even want to make sense of this.
[14:45:54] <Wilto> I worry about what it might do to my mind.
[14:46:08] <Wilto> So it’s the number of SELECTORS in play?
[14:47:14] <Wilto> So… On redraw, Android is re-parsing the CSS and looping through each rule for some reason, but paying little/no mind to the contents of said rules?
[14:48:41] <Wilto> whoops there goes my mind
[14:51:09] <toddmparker_> kinblas: that is nutty
[14:51:26] <toddmparker_> can we ask that android guy about this?
[14:51:45] <Wilto> Yeah. I want the grimy details of the Android CSS parser.
[14:52:40] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah if they ever get back to us
[14:52:57] <toddmparker_> heh
[14:53:11] <toddmparker_> so which page in that zip have you been using for this?
[14:53:55] <kinblas> toddmparker_: the start of the problem can be seen in sample 12
[14:54:10] <kinblas> then you can go to 13 and see that just commenting out the overflow-x was enough to hide the problem
[14:54:10] <toddmparker_> those pages look kinda busted
[14:54:17] <toddmparker_> i.e. no transitions
[14:54:35] <kinblas> toddmparker_: probably because the paths in the files need to be adjusted to point to jquerymobile.com/test/
[14:54:41] <kinblas> or your local source
[14:54:48] <toddmparker_> i see
[14:54:49] <toddmparker_> ok
[14:54:58] <kinblas> sorry I just zipped
[14:55:00] <kinblas> :-)
[14:55:11] <toddmparker_> ok, i'll play with this
[14:55:24] <kinblas> so the latest news is that I took sample-13
[14:55:37] <kinblas> and then just added swatches 'a' 'b' c and d
[14:55:39] <kinblas> and e
[14:55:41] <kinblas> to it
[14:55:44] <kinblas> now the problem is back
[14:55:51] <kinblas> take away d and e
[14:55:53] <kinblas> and it goes away
[14:56:43] <kinblas> the next step I did was to remove all the code in all d and e rules so they were empty ... problem doesn't appear, probably because empty rules get tossed out
[14:56:49] <kinblas> so I put color: black in each one
[14:56:52] <kinblas> and the problem came back
[14:57:07] <kinblas> more rules, more work for the browser to run though when there is a change to the doc
[14:58:26] <kinblas> toddmparker_: Wilto: I guess the first step for you guys is to see at what point flashing if any happens for you on your device ... I notated in the index.htm when that happens for me .... sample-12
[14:58:38] <toddmparker_> ok
[14:58:52] <toddmparker_> i'm just testing /test/ on 2.1 and it's really not that blinky
[14:59:26] <kinblas> toddmparker_: did you try the custom select page?
[14:59:38] <kinblas> what is the device you are using?
[15:00:16] <toddmparker_> HTC Aria
[15:00:24] <toddmparker_> nope, i'll check that
[15:00:35] <toddmparker_> the bigger problem is the back button doesn't seem to work well
[15:00:44] <toddmparker_> hit it and nothing happens
[15:00:58] <toddmparker_> hit again and you get bounced back two steps
[15:01:03] <kinblas> ew
[15:01:09] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:01:09] <kinblas> I'm using an HTC Incredible btw
[15:01:28] <kinblas> I gotta go for now
[15:01:35] <kinblas> sorry
[15:02:50] <toddmparker_> the nav is kinda busted
[15:02:59] <toddmparker_> custom select isn't closing kinblas
[15:03:10] <toddmparker_> anyway, happy thanksgiving all!
[15:03:13] <toddmparker_> i'm leaving too
[15:03:25] <gseguin> to you too!
[15:03:30] <kinblas> toddmparker_: great another bug
[15:03:31] <kinblas> :-)
[15:03:53] <kinblas> gseguin: johnbender: toddmparker_: Wilto: have a good holiday ... see you on Monday
[15:04:00] <Wilto> Alright, yeah, seein’ it on Sample 12.
[15:04:00] <toddmparker_> bye
[15:04:11] <gseguin> Have a good break
[15:04:11] <kinblas> Wlto: great! what about 13?
[15:04:20] * kinblas gets sucked in again
[15:05:06] <Wilto> Yep, same.
[15:06:08] <kinblas> hmmm so you still see the problem with 13?
[15:06:11] <Wilto> Yessir.
[15:06:13] <kinblas> grrr
[15:06:21] <kinblas> I don't see it .. so the overflow-x was a red-herring
[15:06:27] <Wilto> …Wait.
[15:06:41] <Wilto> This is on Android 2.2, mind you:
[15:07:50] <Wilto> Sample 13 does not work at all.
[15:07:59] <Wilto> I can’t click anything.
[15:08:03] <Wilto> s/click/tap
[15:08:10] <kinblas> hmmm weird
[15:08:19] <Wilto> i hate this phone so much you guys
[15:08:28] <kinblas> lol
[15:08:29] <kinblas> ditto
[15:09:12] <Wilto> Right. So. No matter what I do, it keeps focus on page-1 Item 1.”
[15:09:15] <kinblas> I think I'm going to take the basic one that works ... was it sample-11 for you Wilto? and then add some bogus rules
[15:09:15] <Wilto> This sounds familiar.
[15:09:20] <Wilto> And was caused by overflow-x.
[15:09:31] <Wilto> And this is where you re-introduce overflow-x, yeah?
[15:09:40] <kinblas> no 13 was where I took it out
[15:09:44] <Wilto> wat
[15:10:09] <Wilto> Oh I can’t tap anything on 11 either.
[15:10:11] <kinblas> sample-13 I just commented out the overflow-x in the .ui-content rule
[15:10:13] <Wilto> LET ME JUST RESTART THIS PHONE
[15:10:26] <kinblas> grr, I have to run
[15:10:34] <kinblas> don't suck me in Wilto!
[15:10:37] <kinblas> I mean it this time
[15:10:38] <kinblas> :-)
[15:11:16] <Wilto> Go, sir. Go. I should bail myself. Have a good holiday, guys!
