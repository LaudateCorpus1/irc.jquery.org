[08:04:51] <toddparker> gseguin - i saw you nudged the icon sprite. that's fine.
[08:04:56] <toddparker> looks good on my iphone 4
[08:05:09] <toddparker> scott has some feedback on the changes tho
[08:05:21] <gseguin> yeah the images were off by a few pixels
[08:05:22] <toddparker> these should be in the radio check css, not theem
[08:05:34] <gseguin> I saw his email, was just reading it
[08:05:35] <toddparker> and we never set colors so the thee css will cascade
[08:05:39] <toddparker> ok, cool
[08:05:54] <toddparker> you now have the power of branches
[08:05:57] <gseguin> I'll try to address it today
[08:06:05] <toddparker> cool
[08:06:14] <toddparker> kinblas - you here?
[08:06:36] <gseguin> yeah, I was wondering what was best, whether to create a branch on my repo or the global repo
[08:07:08] <gseguin> I like the pull requests for review though
[08:07:49] <toddparker> sure. branches are a bit quicker for reviewing, for me anyway.
[08:29:26] <gseguin> toddparker: sorry if I cut you in the middle of a sentence
[08:29:36] <gseguin> I just arrived at the office
[09:10:35] <gseguin> toddparker: ping
[10:48:57] <toddparker> hey gseguin
[10:49:17] <toddparker> hey all - reminder that our weekly meeting is in 10 minutes
[10:50:04] <toddparker> kinblas, _nickel, scottjehl, gesuin, eddiemonge - that's for you all
[10:50:42] <eddiemonge> big meeting lol
[10:56:50] <gseguin> hey toddparker
[10:57:57] <toddparker> hey
[10:58:13] <toddparker> getting ready for our "meeting"
[10:58:18] <gseguin> ok
[10:58:41] <gseguin> anyways I put my questions into a github comment
[10:58:51] <gseguin> that was regarding Scott's comment
[10:59:11] <scottjehl> hey :)
[10:59:13] <scottjehl> meeting time brb
[10:59:19] <gseguin> hey Scott
[10:59:29] <scottjehl> hey gseguin :)
[11:00:00] <scottjehl> re: your pull: I just think we can do this without adding much code. Maybe even deleting code.
[11:00:05] <scottjehl> I was referring to this part https://github.com/gseguin/jquery-mobile/commit/c2f55b605ae724d88de82fe0a860640a9ff5333a#L0R828
[11:00:18] <scottjehl> looks like we're adding a bunch of css we might not need to
[11:00:25] <scottjehl> especially in the global theme
[11:00:39] <scottjehl> I'll send you a quick branch after the meeting
[11:00:43] <scottjehl> if that's cool
[11:01:38] <gseguin> scottjehl: sounds good, let's talk after the meeting
[11:02:25] <scottjehl> great
[12:21:07] <gseguin> scottjehl: I'm gonna go for lunch, how long are you going to be on IRC?
[12:21:32] <scottjehl> hey sounds fine. check back with me a bit later, but I'll comment on the pull again if that works?
[12:21:43] <gseguin> absolutely
[12:46:48] <scottjehl> gseguin: I think this does what we need with minimal code changes. let me know what you think: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/checkboxradio-newdesign-sj
[13:34:24] <gseguin> scottjehl: almost there
[13:34:35] <scottjehl> hey
[13:34:36] <scottjehl> what's up
[13:34:48] <gseguin> the checkboxes -on are 1px off to the right
[13:35:01] <gseguin> in hi-res
[13:35:16] <scottjehl> yeah... we were looking at that. we weren't sure if it was a half px or not
[13:35:40] <gseguin> actually looking at it closer
[13:35:55] <gseguin> I would say that the -off is 2px off to the right
[13:35:59] <gseguin> sorry
[13:36:09] <gseguin> the off is 1px to the right
[13:36:17] <gseguin> and the -on 2px off to the right
[13:36:35] <scottjehl> the off?
[13:36:48] <scottjehl> no icon showing on the off state though...?
[13:37:09] <scottjehl> oh sorry. right i get what you're saying
[13:37:43] <scottjehl> hmm. dunno. are you comparing them vertically to radios or what?
[13:37:53] <gseguin> if you measure the distance between the border of the button to the edge of the checkbox span.ui-icon
[13:37:59] <gseguin> it should be 15px
[13:38:22] <scottjehl> ah ok. cool. would you happen to have time to make that change?
[13:38:29] <gseguin> I measure 16px
[13:38:40] <gseguin> sure
[13:38:40] <scottjehl> I think the code is otherwise in good shape
[13:38:54] <scottjehl> awesome, thanks
[13:39:12] <gseguin> yeah, the reason I didn't want to remove that class was that one could rely on that
[13:39:40] <gseguin> but it does cause less changes
[13:40:54] <scottjehl> there's an on class for custom overrides
[13:41:03] <scottjehl> active was just the theme class
[13:41:13] <gseguin> ok
[13:41:39] <scottjehl> good point, but I think there's still a hook if someone needs it
[13:42:01] <gseguin> which is?
[13:43:30] <gseguin> scottjehl: ^^^
[13:44:22] <scottjehl> ah you're right. We are missing a widget state there
[13:44:32] <scottjehl> we only have it on the icon
[13:44:37] <scottjehl> that could be moved to the parent
[13:45:18] <gseguin> but then you have to deal with that background-color again
[13:45:19] <scottjehl> ui-btn-active is for theme though... we should be able to remove that. Maybe we can add ui-checkbox-on and ui-radio-on
[13:45:42] <scottjehl> well if we had these on the parent, we could just change color via ui-checkbox-on ui-icon
[13:46:12] <gseguin> wouldn't it change the color of the entire button?
[13:46:30] <scottjehl> ui-checkbox-on ui-icon { ...
[13:47:04] <scottjehl> (move the icon color setting to that selector)
[13:47:37] <gseguin> with the parent (label) having class ui-btn-active?
[13:47:50] <gseguin> not sure I'm following you
[13:47:50] <scottjehl> no no. still removing that
[13:47:54] <gseguin> oh ok
[13:48:00] <scottjehl> my change removed that theme class
[13:48:18] <gseguin> so what's your concern about the -on/-off classes then
[13:48:22] <scottjehl> but like you pointed out, we should move the state classes to the parent element
[13:48:28] <scottjehl> so someone has a hook
[13:48:34] <scottjehl> if they were overriding something
[13:48:34] <gseguin> oh I see
[13:48:48] <gseguin> alright
[13:48:55] <scottjehl> small change then
[13:49:04] <scottjehl> but the icons still need that bump you found
[13:49:17] <gseguin> yes
[13:49:28] <gseguin> I'll submit a pull request when I'm done
[13:50:27] <scottjehl> no need - you can work in that branch right?
[13:50:37] <gseguin> I can
[13:50:56] <scottjehl> as soon as you finish we can just rebase it into master
[13:51:17] <gseguin> ok, as you prefer, I just find it very convenient for reviewing changes
[13:51:25] <scottjehl> actually, Todd wanted to blog on it first to see if people agreed
[13:51:28] <scottjehl> ok pull's fine
[13:51:31] <scottjehl> thanks :)
[13:52:10] <gseguin> I think he tweeted yesterday and got pretty positive feedback
