[07:54:02] <toddmparker> Morning all
[07:55:09] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Hey!
[07:55:13] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker 
[07:55:15] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ 
[07:55:23] <toddmparker> Hi _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi 
[07:55:29] <toddmparker> how was your weekends?
[07:55:38] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Incredible summer day here. My daughter just passed out after, like, 3 hours of splashing around in the pool.
[07:55:42] <toddmparker> holiday weekend here, rained half of it
[07:55:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: :(
[07:55:52] <arschmitz> hey all
[07:55:59] <toddmparker> but i got to race on an indoor track with mini race cars
[07:56:03] <toddmparker> hey arschmitz 
[07:56:08] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: FTW!
[07:56:25] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[07:56:46] <toddmparker> arschmitz: you been here? http://www.maineindoorkarting.com/
[07:57:06] <arschmitz> no even though its only like 10 minutes away lol
[07:57:16] <arschmitz> my brother likes to go there
[07:57:58] <uGoMobi> karting is fun
[07:58:11] <toddmparker> it's a blast
[07:58:15] <uGoMobi> although I am always full of bruises afterwards
[07:58:31] <toddmparker> i don't think I race as hard as uGoMobi 
[07:58:42] <arschmitz> lol
[07:59:46] <toddmparker> you guys see jzaefferer submitted this PR - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/6046
[07:59:52] <toddmparker> be good to review that today
[07:59:59] <arschmitz> i was going to already
[08:00:11] <toddmparker> sweet!
[08:00:14] <arschmitz> since im finishing refactoring the panel to work outside pages it kinda goes with it
[08:00:20] <toddmparker> perfect
[08:01:01] <uGoMobi> yeah had a quick look already, but have to double check removing $.mobile from the functions
[08:02:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: BTW - when you add _setOptions to page widget, do you mind doing that in "next"?
[08:02:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sure
[08:03:35] <uGoMobi> had to make some changes in page widget to remove overlayTheme class without getInheritedTheme()
[08:03:59] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem i knew some changes would need to be made
[08:26:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Since you've removed the need for there to be pages when one uses panels, you may have fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5717. However, it may be hard to determine, because we don't really support navigating to a dialog right from initial page load.
[08:26:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Is your page-independent panel available in a branch?
[08:26:48] <arschmitz> yup
[08:26:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd like to test https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5717 against it.
[08:27:07] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Which branch?
[08:27:12] <arschmitz> ext-panels
[08:27:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Great! Thanks!
[08:27:44] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: fare warning thats not done yet lol
[08:27:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: :)
[08:29:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: so could not reproduce that issue from friday on android 2.2 phone i got
[08:30:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's real difficult to reproduce.
[08:30:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OTOH, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5717 seems to work fine.
[08:30:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... on ext-panels.
[08:30:26] <arschmitz> nice
[08:30:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I guess we need a fixed-in-ext-panels tag :)
[08:30:44] <arschmitz> lol
[08:31:17] <arschmitz> i fixed something WOO! lol
[08:34:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I officially created the label. I didn't quite hit uGoMobi's shade of blue, but it's close :)
[08:34:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: what do you guys think of seperating flip switch and slider
[08:34:43] <uGoMobi> lol
[08:34:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and I reopened the bug.
[08:34:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: +10000001
[08:34:54] <arschmitz> and making the flip switch just toggle not actually drag
[08:34:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I approve wholeheartedly.
[08:35:10] <toddmparker> +10000000000000
[08:35:16] <arschmitz> by making it toggle and not drag performance will increase X1000
[08:35:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'd say animate, not jump, but use a transition or something.
[08:35:21] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/how-can-i-contribute-to-jquery-mobile-core-development#14737000004164004
[08:35:22] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:35:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah thats what i had in mind
[08:35:32] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[08:35:35] <arschmitz> an animation 
[08:35:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's good too.
[08:36:20] <scott_gonzalez> BTW, https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md has links to docs.jquery.com
[08:36:31] <scott_gonzalez> You should update those.
[08:37:02] <gseguin> scott_gonzalez: on it
[08:37:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I've also thought about a more generic problem: Our widgets assume that they are based off of divs, unless they are form widgets, in which case they assume they are based off of inputs. In web-ui-fw I'm on the verge of writing an extension that will allow widget implementations to correctly and systematically deal with input-vs-plain-div.
[08:38:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's probably something we should look at post-1.4.0.
[08:38:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Like, for example, the case where you'd want a slider based off a plain div, rather than an input.
[08:38:35] <arschmitz> toddmparker: didnt you have an example of some pure css toggles?
[08:39:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That should be possible with pseudoselectors.
[08:39:49] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: why dont you just check the nodeName in create and set a flag or something?
[08:39:54] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: thanks, I just commented and asked Esther to hop on here and meet us (new volunteer)
[08:39:55] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15gseguin pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/SUQ9rA
[08:39:55] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14838dbc9 15Ghislain Seguin: Updated contribution urls
[08:40:35] <toddmparker> I also heard back from Dragan (gajotres) who wants to help port a lot of his stack overflow answers into our docs, Q&A
[08:40:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not sure exactly what you had in mind but pseudo selectors are slow
[08:40:46] <toddmparker> he will check in when back from vacation
[08:40:53] <arschmitz> toddmparker: awesome
[08:40:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's more than that. What do you do with the value if it's not an input? If it is an input you need to set .prop( "disabled" ) in addition to everything when enabling/disabling ...
[08:41:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's a host of things you have to do to handle an input vs. a div.
[08:41:42] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: right i know thats why i suggested setting a flag on create then when something happens that required different handeling you could just check that flag
[08:41:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The wrapping is another thing.
[08:42:06] <toddmparker> arschmitz: http://lea.verou.me/2013/03/ios-6-switch-style-checkboxes-with-pure-css/
[08:42:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That would result in if-statements littered throughout a lot of the widgets.
[08:42:38] <arschmitz> toddmparker: thanks probably could not go pure css here but could try to get as close as possible
[08:42:45] <toddmparker> lots of examples, but hers covers the stuff we care about (PE, keyboard, accessibility) so it's a better start. sure uGoMobi has opinions there too
[08:43:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking about an extension that abstracts away some of this stuff and provides a consistent way for doing this stuff.
[08:43:20] <toddmparker> hers uses a bit of js, but it makes it more compatible
[08:43:24] <uGoMobi> sure, I can help with that
[08:43:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For example, it would provide a _setValue() method that would set the value of the widget.
[08:43:45] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm i like that it should be essentially the same for all form widgets 
[08:43:50] <arschmitz> the special handeling that is
[08:43:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: If the widget is based on a div, it could be configured to set an option and emit a signal, instead of setting the value and emitting "change".
[08:44:36] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: is there any reason a div cant emit change ? its a little weird but in this case would make sense
[08:44:46] <arschmitz> iv never actually tried before
[08:45:10] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, you're right. It can emit any signal you can think of, but it has no value.
[08:45:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Only inputs have value, AFAIK,
[08:45:36] <gseguin> anybody using webstorm with our jQM license?
[08:45:44] <uGoMobi> actually you can set value attr for LI in OL
[08:45:53] <gseguin> It has expired, in the middle of JSConf... great!
[08:46:07] <gseguin> I have contacted them to renew it
[08:46:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What meaning does it have in that context? Does it determine the order of the items?
[08:46:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah wouldnt use value but you can have it include value as part of the event object
[08:47:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it sets the the number that will be used
[08:47:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Another reason to not emit change would be that third-party stuff might behave weirdly if change is emitted at times when the native widget would not have emitted it.
[08:47:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, so that's the same syntax, totally different semantics - great!
[08:47:41] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah maybe widgetnameChange would be better
[08:48:00] <uGoMobi> yeah, I didn't write the specs :)
[08:48:01] <arschmitz> and then you could just _trigger("change")
[08:49:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, but then, if you have two different widgets for setting the same type of value (web-ui-fw has at least three different widgets you can use with <input type="color">) then you lose some of the polymorphism,
[08:49:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But anyway, regardless whether we emit a prefixed signal or not, the point is we need to do a bit of wrapping if we want to handle input-vs-div uniformly.
[08:50:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... with the minimum amount of code.
[08:50:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah its something good to put some thought into
[08:51:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: https://github.com/web-ui-fw/web-ui-fw/tree/jqm/js/behaviors
[08:51:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Check out setValue, createOuter, and setDisabled
[08:52:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking about unifying them into one extension.
[08:52:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Form widgets would definitely benefit.
[08:52:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's too much work for the next release of web-ui-fw, but eventually ...

[08:57:19] <gseguin> Any idea why integration/fixed-toolbar test is hanging?
[08:57:28] <gseguin> some times
[08:57:43] <arschmitz> best guess i broke something
[08:57:51] <arschmitz> when adding toolbar widget
[08:58:15] <arschmitz> its only sometimes though?
[08:58:25] <gseguin> it's not hanging with all versions of jquery but I doubt it's related to that
[08:58:50] <arschmitz> is the versions thats hanging consistant?
[08:59:01] <gseguin> I haven't tried locally
[08:59:09] <gseguin> but looking at the grid on Travis
[08:59:28] <arschmitz> gseguin: its completely inconsistant on travis
[08:59:34] <gseguin> it seems more like an unstable test than a test that fails with a particular verion of jQuery
[08:59:36] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 06next: 02http://git.io/SE8SnQ
[08:59:36] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06next 14272b405 15Jasper de Groot: Slider: Removed specific margins and width for mini sized. We just use smaller font-size and em values now.
[08:59:52] <gseguin> yeah we need to find out why 
[08:59:53] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah its deffinitly not version specific
[09:01:02] <arschmitz> gseguin: i just ran local a few times and it didnt hange but its so inconsistant that does not mean much
[09:02:49] <johnbender> gseguin: did you get my message about unit < integration?
[09:05:58] <gseguin> johnbender: nope missed it
[09:06:44] <gseguin> arschmitz: yeah I wonder what causes these failures, it sucks to have a non-stable CI
[09:06:59] <gseguin> johnbender: what was it about?
[09:08:48] <arschmitz> gseguin: i just went back through last 20 failures
[09:08:51] <johnbender> gseguin: just wondering if we can foce the unit tests to go first where they are present
[09:09:03] <johnbender> gseguin: I glanced at what we have now and it didn't look obviou
[09:09:05] <arschmitz> 10 were nav failures
[09:09:05] <johnbender> *obvious
[09:09:27] <arschmitz> gseguin: 8 were timeouts on fixedtoolbars
[09:09:35] <gseguin> johnbender: let me check how easy it is
[09:09:42] <arschmitz> an 2 were select widget failures
[09:09:52] <gseguin> arschmitz: so there definitely something we could fix there
[09:10:31] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah just need to track down what it is
[09:11:08] <arschmitz> gseguin: because its so inconsistant my guess is there is some sort of race condition for the timeouts
[09:12:13] <arschmitz> best guess its from moving the logic out of page.sections ( just a plain function ) and into the page / toolbar widgets
[09:12:39] <gseguin> johnbender: yeah, easy!
[09:13:59] <gseguin> I just have to sort the types array in reverse alphabetical order and that will do the trick
[09:18:07] <johnbender> gseguin: awesome
[09:22:01] <gseguin> AH! I'm so worthless for conflict resolution without my IDE :(((
[09:33:54] <arschmitz> johnbender: you have a second?
[09:34:44] <toddmparker> (today is my marathon working session with a client, so i'l be out now.)
[09:40:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you here still?
[09:47:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. What's up?
[09:47:56] <arschmitz> haveing an issue with a test thought you might have an idea
[09:48:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Sure! Which one?
[09:48:11] <arschmitz> so fixedtoolbars are now just an extension of toolbar
[09:48:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I found them all to be rather flaky on master ...
[09:48:33] <arschmitz> the fixedtoolbar tests are totally randomly timing out
[09:49:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Weird ... are there any JS errors?
[09:49:02] <arschmitz> looks like the reason is about 1 time out of 20 some how the extension is running before toolbar
[09:49:20] <arschmitz> so its trying to extend something that does not exist
[09:49:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Wow! Shouldn't be happening if AMD is working OK ...
[09:50:37] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: fixedToolbar does not AMD-depend on toolbar.
[09:50:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That's probably the reason.
[09:51:18] <arschmitz> ye
[09:51:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: They are loaded "in parallel" from tests/unit/fixed-toolbar/index.html
[09:51:31] <arschmitz> as soon as you said amd i checked and realized i never added it
[09:51:42] <arschmitz> thank you 
[09:51:42] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hope that fixes it.
[09:51:57] <arschmitz> im checking now
[09:52:08] <arschmitz> its random but often enough that i should be able to tell
[09:52:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... otherwise I'll start putting "I want to believe" posters up on my walls - much to my family's dismay, no doubt.
[09:53:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah explains why i could not reproduce on an actual page too
[09:54:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly. Those are still handled by js/index.php ...
[09:54:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It'd be nice if we could switch away from PHP and to some server-side JS that runs requirejs ...
[09:54:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Although running the build everytime the page is requested is insane. NM.
[09:55:03] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah 
[09:55:20] <arschmitz> that would be a bit much
[09:55:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Goes to show you how much of an instinct I have for admin ...
[09:56:09] <_|Nix|_> *scratch head*
[09:56:48] <_|Nix|_> ... and speaking of ... I might just get some hosting for web-ui-fw API docs ... yaaay!
[09:56:59] <arschmitz> nice
[09:58:22] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: speaking of which i know you are using git hub pages now but if you ever need / want some hosting / server space i have a server im more then happy to set you up on pretty sure i can trust you lol
[09:59:29] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its a dedicated server from hudson valley host 
[09:59:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Thanks a lot! I figured I'd try Intel first. Our neck of the Intel woods has a site up at http://01.org/ where we host a bunch of our projects, so I figured this would be the natural place for ir.
[09:59:40] <_|Nix|_> s/ir/it/
[10:00:08] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i just mean in general to set up stuff for testing or what ever too
[10:00:16] <arschmitz> any needs you may have
[10:00:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, that's just it - if ever we get web-ui-fw to the point where jQM links to it as a resource, I think we may need some bandwidth ...
[10:01:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: BRB - I'm'a call our hosting guy ...

[10:26:22] <gseguin> I'm in git hell
[10:27:00] <gseguin> johnbender: I've got your change pending but effing git is not wanting me to push it
[10:27:19] <gseguin> I got conflict gallore!
[10:38:03] <johnbender> gseguin: cool thanks man
[10:38:48] <johnbender> arschmitz: _|Nix|_ gseguin: a quick comment on the current/newish event structure for the nav refactor https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5427#issuecomment-18566708
[10:38:52] <johnbender> simple idea
[10:38:58] <johnbender> mostly just deprecating page*
[10:39:02] <johnbender> in favor of content*
[10:39:18] <johnbender> but there are two key changes
[10:39:33] <johnbender> beforechange and change will only fire if `change` is called
[10:39:45] <johnbender> ie, load and transition have their own events
[10:40:10] <johnbender> and the second beforechange is deprecated in favor of beforetransition

[10:48:49] <gseguin> F it I'm recloning the repo

[10:49:40] <gseguin> Fuuuu
[10:55:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Egads!
[10:55:28] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Does no amount of git reset --hard HEAD~1 help?
[10:55:48] <gseguin> no
[10:56:08] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: My repo is borked, I need a git expert to look at it
[10:56:34] <gseguin> I'll ask around
[10:58:35] <gseguin> something is going on with js/widgets/toolbar.js
[10:58:44] <gseguin> even on my fresh repo clone
[10:58:55] <gseguin> it says I modified it and I haven't touch that file

[11:51:59] <arschmitz> johnbender: the event sequence sounds good i think this is more clear then the current events. 
[11:52:52] <arschmitz> johnbender: i also like removing the page events because i think its confusing that the page events are not part of the page widget
[12:43:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[12:44:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[12:45:52] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/izases/4/edit
[12:46:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: works in ie8 too
[12:47:03] <uGoMobi> that looks nice
[12:47:14] <arschmitz> the js is ultra minimal
[12:47:24] <arschmitz> just adding a div and toggle a class
[12:47:47] <uGoMobi> yeah I am looking at that now
[12:47:56] <arschmitz> i know the prechecked isnt working too lol just didnt have it add the class for that yet in js
[12:49:05] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:49:44] <uGoMobi> was looking if it could work the same with select as well
[12:52:22] <uGoMobi> probably makes it more complicated
[12:52:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah could be something to look at for seperating toggle though
[12:56:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: if you leave out the iOS styling there is almost no code left :)
[12:56:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah
[12:56:43] <arschmitz> i adapted that from something else
[12:56:50] <arschmitz> i didnt write all the ios stuff lol
[12:57:03] <uGoMobi> I understand
[13:01:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/izases/6
[13:01:46] <arschmitz> pre-checked works there
[13:02:26] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ie8 needs a little work but its not bad
[13:05:04] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: don't understand yet why the height 1em shouldn't be applied in older browsers (that don't support :root selector)
[13:05:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im not either to be honest but it is all off with out it
[13:05:58] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:06:28] <uGoMobi> didn't try IE8 but I suppose it needs some height too
[13:06:51] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ie8 is what the :root is for
[13:07:03] <uGoMobi> yes it rules out IE8
[13:08:27] <uGoMobi> oh wait, there is another height in there.... .65em
[13:08:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah the root one is what it should be in newer browsers
[13:08:52] <arschmitz> i mean in ie8
[13:09:00] <arschmitz> 1 em is for newer browsers
[13:09:07] <uGoMobi> yes
[13:09:34] <arschmitz> oh and its because of font-size:150%;
[13:09:51] <arschmitz> that does not work in ie8 here
[13:10:49] <uGoMobi> aha
[13:11:29] <uGoMobi> I guess 150% * .65em = ~ 1em
[13:13:12] <arschmitz> yeah
[13:13:13] <uGoMobi> does % font-size not work in IE8? or do you have to set some font-size for html or body to make it work
[13:13:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: font-size does not appear to be working at all there
[13:13:41] <arschmitz> i tried px and it does not change anythin
[13:13:43] <uGoMobi> oh :/
[13:15:12] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: im a bit confused why it does not work
[13:18:25] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, that's interesting
[13:18:47] <uGoMobi> I am looking in an IE8 emulator now
[13:21:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: normally I checkbox doesn't have content so maybe that's why it doesn't work
[13:22:05] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I tried setting it for the pseudo elements but that doesn't work either
[13:22:21] <uGoMobi> s/I checkbox/a checkbox/
[13:23:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i got it
[13:23:47] <arschmitz> its because the :before and after had font: bold 60%/1.9 sans-serif;
[13:24:03] <arschmitz> set that and the percent above both in px and it works in ie8
[13:25:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ah I see that now at the bottom
[14:03:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/izases/12
[14:03:18] <arschmitz> all fixed up in ie
[14:03:21] <arschmitz> 8
[14:03:36] <uGoMobi> awesome
[14:03:39] <arschmitz> didnt take any js either 
[14:03:48] <arschmitz> well additional to what was there already
[14:04:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i should make this into a widget its crazy tiny lol 
[14:05:13] <arschmitz> ot that it "needs" to be a widget but just for completeness and ability to set theme and destroy refresh etcs
[14:06:02] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:06:18] <uGoMobi> but soooo much better than what we have now
[14:06:23] <arschmitz> yeah for sure
[14:06:34] <arschmitz> and it looks pretty good in ie honestly i think
[14:06:40] <arschmitz> ie8*
[14:06:40] <uGoMobi> now see if we can improve the slider a bit as well
[14:08:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i need to set up some test pages for that
[14:09:07] <uGoMobi> was just trying it again on Chrome/Android and it was almost impossible to drag
[14:09:27] <uGoMobi> looking at Chrome beta (with blink) now BTW
[14:09:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah well take the bad android performance and /2
[14:10:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i have a few sliders im going to put on some test pages to compare performance
[14:10:46] <uGoMobi> ok great
[14:11:04] <arschmitz> which ever one wins i figure we can use as a basis for new slider
[14:11:41] <uGoMobi> we could take a look at how other frameworks do it
[14:12:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: thats basicly what im doing iv collected different ones and im going to make a page with like 20 on the page
[14:12:21] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[14:12:22] <uGoMobi> great
[14:12:28] <arschmitz> and try on phones to see which one performs best
[14:12:42] <uGoMobi> yeah that's best approach
[14:27:56] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I just installed Opera Next (webkit)... that has Off road instead of Turbo as well and on there JQM just works
