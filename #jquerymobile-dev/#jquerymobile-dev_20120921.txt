[00:24:27] <uGoMobi> morning all
[05:38:56] <Gandalfar> hey guys .. I can't seem to find .ai/fireworks template file for jQuery Mobile 1.2-rc1? :)
[07:00:38] <Wilto> huh what hi
[07:08:17] <toddmparker_> morning
[07:13:17] <toddmparker_> gandalfar - we don't update an AI anymore. All designs happen in code.
[07:13:38] <robschmuecker> morning
[07:14:14] <toddmparker_> morning
[07:14:26] <toddmparker_> no worries about the meeting yesterday
[07:14:35] <toddmparker_> if you can make it, cool
[07:14:44] <toddmparker_> not sure I was clear on how to join either
[07:14:45] <robschmuecker> yes - got the wrong end of the stick :)
[07:15:17] <robschmuecker> I only saw afterwards that it was a different channel - no stress !
[07:15:30] <robschmuecker> I thought the opera hacking might have been the meeting!
[07:16:14] <toddmparker_> heh
[07:16:43] <toddmparker_> so that is our life. find a bizarro bug, try to find the least offensive way to work around it.
[07:17:33] <robschmuecker> :| x-browser compatibilty is a lifestyle of its own!
[07:21:05] <toddmparker_> sort of a fun game to make it all work. but it's a grind.
[07:21:13] <toddmparker_> these browsers are buggy as hell.
[07:22:44] <robschmuecker> hmmm so much for standards eh?! I must admit though this is at least understandable as your pushing the envelope on devices with limited resources but my previous epic battles between IE5.5 - IE8 really tested my will to live :)
[07:25:36] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender I know why we jump outside history if you go to a dialog/popup and refresh.
[07:25:36] <bot-t> _|Nix|_, Okay.
[07:47:31] <toddmparker_> robschmuecker: we're still building with web standards, that's the key. We're just being smart about what CSS and JS properties to use. Lots of ways to do something, we're picking the most compatible to sidestep bugs instead of using a lot of UA ugliness and branching fo code.
[07:48:32] <robschmuecker> yes I quite agree - I just wish browser houses would make a bit more effort to incorporate standards . . .
[07:48:55] <robschmuecker> Not trying to be funny but I think I've got the popup solution on Opera mini to play nice and open where clicked.
[07:49:31] <robschmuecker> Does require a css change onclick though to take note of the click Y position
[08:08:58] <toddmparker_> interesting. do you have a demo page?
[08:09:16] <robschmuecker> just busy trying to tidy it up a little - give me a little while
[08:09:21] <toddmparker_> ok
[08:12:34] <toddmparker_> be good to look at input type=file now - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5050
[08:15:55] <gseguin> mornin'
[08:36:24] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[08:36:48] <toddmparker_> MauriceG was kind enough to create a RC2 changelog so I dropped that into a blog post.
[08:37:01] <toddmparker_> If we wanted to do RC2 today, we could
[08:39:02] <gseguin> the earlier the better, isn't it?
[08:42:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I want to check this issue before RC2 https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5053
[08:43:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: nevermind, already fixed
[08:43:19] <MauriceG> Morning all
[08:43:24] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[08:43:24] <gseguin> what about that one: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5029 ?
[08:43:33] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi !
[08:43:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: shoot
[08:43:34] <bot-t> (1 hour 17 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender I know why we jump outside history if you go to a dialog/popup and refresh.
[08:44:08] <MauriceG> toddmparker_:  I hope you've removed one of the log entries ...
[08:44:44] <uGoMobi> johnbender: did you have a test yesterday for your phd?
[08:44:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I did
[08:45:02] <uGoMobi> johnbender: how did it go?
[08:45:08] <johnbender> uGoMobi: well
[08:45:14] <johnbender> not perfect but well
[08:45:18] <uGoMobi> good to hear that :)
[08:45:25] <johnbender> good enough that I don't feel like I'll take it again
[08:45:29] <uGoMobi> well is perfect :)
[08:45:36] <johnbender> I'm happy
[08:45:42] <johnbender> just waiting to hear back on my analytical writting
[08:45:44] <uGoMobi> that's what count
[08:45:49] <johnbender> if that turned out horrible for some reason I'll have to take it again
[08:45:56] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:46:06] <uGoMobi> when will you hear that?
[08:47:28] <toddmparker_> MauriceG: the one on the img margin? YES
[08:49:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: are we ready to deploy rc 2?
[08:50:20] <toddmparker_> yessir
[08:53:00] <toddmparker_> wait, crap
[08:53:06] <toddmparker_> need to quickly update the docs
[08:53:49] <toddmparker_> MauriceG: need your eyes on this
[08:53:56] <toddmparker_> i always miss things :)
[08:54:12] <MauriceG> toddmparker_: yes
[08:55:20] <MauriceG> toddmparker_: Docs: image vertical alignment (Issue: #5037)
[09:01:25] <toddmparker_> yeah, that :)
[09:01:32] <toddmparker_> adding a note to the supported browser page
[09:01:34] <toddmparker_> * Note: If jQuery core 1.8+ is used with jQuery Mobile, iOS 3.x and BB5 are re-graded to C grade support because core dropped support for methods these platforms need for full functionality.
[09:01:40] <toddmparker_> better way to phrase this?
[09:08:26] <toddmparker_> ok, updated the docs
[09:08:33] <toddmparker_> MauriceG: mind taking a look to see what I missed?
[09:08:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/9rYqdg
[09:08:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs - Updated refs to rc.2, added a note about support for BB5 and iOS3 - toddparker
[09:08:34] <MauriceG> toddmparker_: no, reads ok for me. May a comma between  support, because ...
[09:09:10] <MauriceG> toddmparker_: k
[09:13:55] <uGoMobi> do we support data-overlay theme for custom select menu? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5051
[09:16:00] <MauriceG> toddmparker_:  looks great !
[09:27:10] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: I don't think so, no. double check the code, but if not supported, i'd close as wontfix
[09:27:16] <toddmparker_> MauriceG: really? amazing.
[09:27:45] <toddmparker_> johnbender: you can do the build now
[09:27:58] <toddmparker_> i'm ready to announce whenever
[09:28:08] <toddmparker_> we're getting faster at these
[09:28:35] <johnbender> toddmparker_: will do
[09:35:26] <johnbender> toddmparker_: tag it too?
[09:35:26] <johnbender> gs
[09:35:38] * johnbender grumbles about window focus
[09:37:14] <toddmparker_> sure
[09:37:30] <toddmparker_> thoughts on what to do on input file
[09:37:31] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/ikolun/1/edit
[09:37:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/eTETTQ
[09:37:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] bump the version to 1.2.0-rc.2 - John Bender
[09:38:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I don't know much about the API, can we shuttle information between that and a styled text field?
[09:39:02] <toddmparker_> it's a very mixed bag
[09:39:06] <johnbender> sigh
[09:39:20] <toddmparker_> i just added it to the initselector for text input so it gets styles and it looks great on chrome
[09:39:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ah, I meant doing something custom
[09:39:51] <johnbender> specifically for it
[09:40:18] <toddmparker_> locked down like mad for secuity
[09:40:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yar
[09:40:31] <toddmparker_> but our standard input styles look great on iOS6
[09:41:11] <johnbender> toddmparker_: as a start it might be a good idea to just add some information to the docs about which platforms support it and how people can include exclude manually using the selector
[09:42:27] <toddmparker_> it looks good, surprisingly
[09:42:41] <toddmparker_> i want to test this more, but it's a small change that might be worth doing
[09:42:46] <toddmparker_> just adds a few classes
[09:43:05] <toddmparker_> checks out in android 4 too
[09:43:19] <toddmparker_> ff is meh, but not worse than default
[09:45:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: loving the new logo
[09:45:41] <johnbender> toddmparker_: deployed
[09:45:45] <toddmparker_> sweet
[09:45:51] <johnbender> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0-rc.2/
[09:45:57] <johnbender> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.2.0-rc.2/jquery.mobile-1.2.0-rc.2.js
[09:46:20] <toddmparker_> testing links now, looks good
[09:46:37] <toddmparker_> unless i can find a downside, this file change may be worth landing
[09:47:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'd wait on it given that people can make it themselves
[09:47:24] <johnbender> there may be assumptions predicated on its current exclusion
[09:47:33] <toddmparker_> yeah, true
[09:47:44] <toddmparker_> we should add a blurb to the docs
[09:47:54] <johnbender> good idea imo
[09:51:27] <toddmparker_> BOOM - http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/09/21/jquery-mobile-1-2-0-release-candidate-2/
[09:51:35] <toddmparker_> nice work all
[09:51:43] <toddmparker_> we're getting faster at this now
[09:51:49] <MauriceG> I've checked all RC.2 links and references in the docs rc.2. All ok.
[09:51:57] <toddmparker_> thanks for checking MauriceG
[09:52:51] <robschmuecker> great stuff well done guys.
[09:53:57] <robschmuecker> @toddparker_ here's a bin of the Opera Mini postioning POC - only currently working with the photo popup but I've littered a few of those throughout the document to test for differing margin values.  Perhaps read comments in the JS section of the bin before opening it in opera mini.
[09:53:58] <robschmuecker> http://jsbin.com/orowiw/1/edit
[09:58:30] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/ikolun/4
[09:58:50] <toddmparker_> ^^ example of file being added via JS
[10:01:36] <toddmparker_> robschmuecker: hey, that's very promising
[10:02:04] <toddmparker_> i wonder if we could tied this in so we can re-use the collision detection already in place
[10:02:17] <toddmparker_> that this would be a fallback way to capture coordinates
[10:02:30] <MauriceG> toddmparker_: blog: "weâ€™ve re-enabled the fix for select an inputs zooming in unnecessarily in iOS6" ...  I don't get this ...  Is this correct worded?
[10:04:09] <toddmparker_> so if you have an input or select that fills the screen width on iOS, you wouldn't think it woudl zoom in when focused, but it still does
[10:04:16] <toddmparker_> we have a hack to prevent that
[10:04:24] <toddmparker_> but it broke in iOS6
[10:04:27] <toddmparker_> so we fixed it
[10:04:31] <toddmparker_> cryptic, I know
[10:04:46] <robschmuecker> @toddmparker_ not sure I follow regardin a coordinate captuer fallback?
[10:05:11] <toddmparker_> it's annoying tho, tap a select, it zooms in 20% and cuts off some of the text. when you make a selection, iOS leaves you marooned at that odd zoom level
[10:05:35] <toddmparker_> robschmuecker: in your comments, you mention that there are cases where this can be positioned offscreen
[10:05:45] <robschmuecker> right, yes.
[10:05:47] <toddmparker_> we already have a bunch of code to prevent this from happening
[10:06:07] <toddmparker_> so if you could pipe this in through that code, it would be ideal
[10:06:08] <robschmuecker> ah ok, yes that makes sense . . .
[10:06:25] <toddmparker_> not sure what that entails, but worth a mention
[10:06:59] <robschmuecker> yes would be good, and then I'll just need to figure out the nuances as to how Operas servers format our other types of pop-ups as they do behave somewhat differently if they don't have an image inside :(
[10:07:28] <MauriceG> toddmparker_: I know the issue.  Ahh,   so it should be worded  "selectS anD inputs" ...
[10:08:41] <toddmparker_> gah. updated!
[10:09:57] <MauriceG> I thought, my english became worse each day,  puh ...
[10:11:15] <MauriceG> toddmparker_:  fine !
[10:19:28] <toddmparker_> my english gets worse each day
[13:59:46] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Hi! Are you around for a quick question?
[14:40:28] <toddmparker_> sure am
[14:41:26] <agcolom> Hi :-), I am doing the button api doc at the moment...
[14:41:31] <toddmparker_> ah, ok
[14:41:42] <agcolom> let me find my question again...
[14:41:52] <toddmparker_> ok
[14:42:48] <agcolom> here it is :-)
[14:43:19] <agcolom> on this page http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-types.html we use Mini size as a title for mini elements
[14:43:40] <agcolom> However, on most other widget pages, we use mini-version
[14:44:07] <agcolom> see http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/slider/ for example
[14:44:19] <agcolom> sorry we use Mini version as a title
[14:44:48] <agcolom> Are you happy to for me to change Mini size to Mini version?
[14:45:38] <agcolom> (on this page:  http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/buttons/buttons-types.html )
[14:46:28] <agcolom> toddmparker_: ^
[14:47:03] <toddmparker_> sorry, back
[14:47:23] <toddmparker_> sure
[14:47:38] <toddmparker_> either is fine with me as long we we're consistent.
[14:47:43] <agcolom> ok, great! will do that tomorrow...
[14:47:49] <toddmparker_> whichever you prefer :)
[14:48:11] <agcolom> Well everything else has "mini version" so I'll stick to that :-)
[14:48:46] <toddmparker_> sounds like a plan
[14:48:52] <toddmparker_> quiet in here today
[14:48:57] <agcolom> It's terrible, the students are back and I've been so busy!
[14:49:00] <toddmparker_> least dramatic release ever
[14:49:05] <uGoMobi> Is it wingy day?
[14:49:07] <toddmparker_> understandable
[14:49:13] <toddmparker_> oh my
[14:49:19] <uGoMobi> that guy posted like 10 issues today :(
[14:49:24] <toddmparker_> that person is going to be a huge pain
[14:49:34] <toddmparker_> feature requests for the most part
[14:49:37] <toddmparker_> close, close, close
[14:49:37] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:49:48] <toddmparker_> wontfix, wontfix, wontfix
[14:49:59] <toddmparker_> but still...takes time
[14:50:19] <agcolom> Yes, I've seen all these in my mailbox!
[14:50:33] <agcolom> Should die out in a few days...
[14:50:46] <uGoMobi> hope so
[14:51:18] <agcolom> Well, it's bedtime for me :-) the api docs are looking sooooooo good ;-)
[14:51:40] <uGoMobi> nice :)
[14:51:44] <uGoMobi> good night Anne
[14:51:57] <agcolom> I still need a few extra things from the ui and core api docs style, but we're getting there :-)
[14:52:35] <agcolom> It's so nice when I can spend a bit of time on this :-)
[14:52:58] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper, goodnight Todd, and have a Great weekend!
[14:53:07] <uGoMobi> thanks, you too!
[14:53:51] <agcolom> Thanks :-)
[14:57:24] <toddmparker_> they are, thanks for all your work on this agcolom
[14:57:45] <toddmparker_> means we can delete all the API stuff and just concentrate on cool demos
[14:57:54] <toddmparker_> have a great weekend all
[14:57:59] <toddmparker_> i'm heading out too
[14:58:32] <uGoMobi> thanks toddmparker_ , you too
