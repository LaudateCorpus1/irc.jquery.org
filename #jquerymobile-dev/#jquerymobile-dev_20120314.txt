[03:48:31] <jzaefferer> Why is this logging 'tapped' twice for each click/tap? At least in Chrome/OSX and Chrome/Android: http://jsbin.com/uqanak/edit#source

[04:39:54] <jzaefferer> Is there a special events test page?
[04:40:18] <jzaefferer> Looks like swipe event doesn't work on Windows Phone 7...
[06:55:40] <jzaefferer> johnbender toddmparker_ or Wilto around? Looking for some input on touch events in general, swipe and pinch special events in particular.
[07:17:01] <toddparker> morning
[07:17:10] <toddparker> hey jzaefferer
[07:17:58] <Wilto> Whatup.
[07:18:00] <jzaefferer> hey toddparker
[07:18:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/9QhOAQ
[07:18:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Add iconpos to data attr list for collapsibles and collapsible sets - Jake Boone
[07:18:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3812 from jakeboone02/patch-12 - Todd Parker
[07:18:14] <Wilto> jzaefferer: No touch events on that sucker.
[07:18:24] <jzaefferer> So I'm looking for something like this that would work outside of just iOS: https://gist.github.com/6b9ad0a147fb6d903b6e
[07:18:28] <Wilto> jzaefferer: That I know of, anyway. Sure as hell not standard ones, if any.
[07:18:39] <jzaefferer> Wilto: Anything we can do there?
[07:18:59] <Wilto> Ehh, we could ghetto-rig “swipe” using mouse events, but that’s about it.
[07:19:06] <jzaefferer> Also, how do you test that stuff? The events page is just docs, nothing to demo/test
[07:19:24] <jzaefferer> Wilto: You already do that, it works in desktop Chrome
[07:19:41] <jzaefferer> But doesn't look like the mouse events on Windows Phone are sufficient for that
[07:19:45] <Wilto> wat
[07:19:46] <jzaefferer> Or whatever it does
[07:20:17] <Wilto> Oh, oh, okay, yeah.
[07:20:49] <toddparker> true. we should probably build a demo page for the events. Be good for testing anyway. Just a logger really.
[07:21:15] <jzaefferer> toddparker: How did you test the swipe event so far?
[07:21:42] <Wilto> I’ve always dealt with that stuff outside the docs. Put a test together locally.
[07:22:07] <jzaefferer> Ugh
[07:22:18] <jzaefferer> Still got something around to start with?
[07:22:21] <Wilto> SO NEEDY, JÖRN
[07:22:22] <toddparker> yeah, we've built various test pages int he past
[07:22:41] <toddparker> but I'v been trying to bake a lot more into the docs, both for demo'ing and for quick access to tests
[07:23:27] <toddparker> kin and scott would be the best people to ask...
[07:23:52] <jzaefferer> you're talking about the guy that is just entering India?
[07:23:56] <Wilto> I was just sayin’, we could set up a quick page that just spits out that event info in a textarea.
[07:24:29] <Wilto> Scott’s like a lone monk, jzaefferer. Wandering the world and honing his already formidable kung fu.
[07:24:37] <jzaefferer> haha
[07:25:27] <jzaefferer> So, if there's something to start with, I'd prefer that. Otherwise, if there are plans to integrate into existing docs, I'd like to know those. Otherwise I'll probably hack together more silos that help no one else.
[07:25:34] <Wilto> Anyway, yeah, gestures are one of those things where we’re drawing a pretty hard line with “if you’re doing things fundamentally wrong, we’re not gonna write a gig of code for the sake of holding your hand.”
[07:26:15] <jzaefferer> "doings things fundamentally wrong", what does that mean? I'm mostly looking for a pinch gesture.
[07:26:26] <jzaefferer> Either to implement or to tell people its not gonna happen...
[07:26:33] <Wilto> Here’s hoping they use specced touch events in Windows 8̶9.
[07:27:02] <jzaefferer> specced? You mean those Apple-patent ladden things?
[07:27:07] <Wilto> shh
[07:27:12] <Wilto> I do what I must.
[07:27:19] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez can tell you all about it /o\
[07:27:39] <Wilto> No one said I don’t go scrub my hands for half an hour like Lady MacBeth after doing this stuff.
[07:28:15] <Wilto> But this sucker: http://www.w3.org/TR/touch-events/
[07:28:20] <jzaefferer> Deinfection for the mind...
[07:28:40] <Wilto> I mean, gestures _themselves_ are a maze of twisty patents, all alike.
[07:28:58] <Wilto> But at least we have a spec for the events themselves.
[07:29:19] <jzaefferer> Holy moly, "Usage Examples".
[07:29:39] <Wilto> document.write is the future, jzaefferer.
[07:30:03] <jzaefferer> but then an item method m(
[07:30:31] <jzaefferer> and document.write, yeah
[07:33:05] <Wilto> THE FUTURE
[07:35:26] <Wilto> But yeah, rumor also has it that Windows 8 is gonna have Windows 8 Enterprise Professional Proprietary Touch Events™, too. Probably using “filter.”
[07:36:20] <Wilto> So it’s one of those things where we can either start normalizing for then wrong things all over the place, or say “we support the standard.”
[07:38:17] <Wilto> Little squeamish about the origin of said standard, but again: dish soap and steel wool.
[07:39:10] <scott_gonzalez> Wilto: Don't normalize to anything related to Touch.
[07:39:30] <scott_gonzalez> Windows 8 has MSPointer.
[07:39:35] <scott_gonzalez> It's much saner.
[07:39:40] <scott_gonzalez> Not a standard, but could be.
[07:39:43] <scott_gonzalez> Touch is NOT a standard.
[07:39:50] <scott_gonzalez> There's a draft, but it's not final.
[07:39:55] <Wilto> It’s the closest thing we got.
[07:39:56] <scott_gonzalez> It's also potentially going to be thrown away.
[07:40:10] <scott_gonzalez> Wilto: It's also a HUGE liability.
[07:40:22] <scott_gonzalez> jQuery can get sued like crazy for normalizing to Touch.
[07:40:50] <Wilto> wat
[07:41:18] <scott_gonzalez> I guess we need to have a call to go over this.
[07:41:44] <scott_gonzalez> We should get you and whoever else is necessary on a call with me and Dave.
[07:42:04] <Wilto> You’re saying anyone that uses Apple’s touch events could be sued.
[07:42:18] <scott_gonzalez> No, anyone who normalizes to it can be though.
[07:42:21] <scott_gonzalez> potentially
[07:42:22] <Wilto> Dude, they don’t have a patent on _touch events_. They may have patents on gestures.
[07:42:34] <scott_gonzalez> Actually, they do.
[07:42:34] <Wilto> Where are you getting this?
[07:42:39] <scott_gonzalez> W3C
[07:42:43] <scott_gonzalez> USPTO
[07:42:52] <Wilto> So… so like, this spec—and the events themselves—are some kind of dastardly trap.
[07:42:54] <scott_gonzalez> They have patents on pretty much everything related to touch.
[07:43:08] <scott_gonzalez> touch events, gestures, distinguishing between a finger and your thumb.
[07:43:10] <scott_gonzalez> Literally.
[07:43:13] <Wilto> If I bind to touchstart, someone at Apple mutters “gotcha,” and pets a nefarious-looking cat.
[07:43:24] <scott_gonzalez> No, you can bind to touchstart.
[07:43:30] <toddparker> This sorta seems crazy…we're just normalizing whatever crazy events (mouse, keyboard, touch) events that browsers currently emit
[07:43:36] <scott_gonzalez> But if you decide to map mousedown to touchstart, you could potentially be sued.
[07:43:54] <Wilto> Oh, for Christ’s sakes.
[07:43:55] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: The current normalization is fine, because it doesn't normalize TO touch.
[07:43:59] <toddparker> That's like saying jQuery core could be sued for using some browsers specific property or method in it's abstractions
[07:44:00] <scott_gonzalez> It normalizes FROM touch.
[07:44:31] <toddparker> right
[07:44:45] <scott_gonzalez> toddparker: You mean like how browser vendors get sued for having "dynamic content"?
[07:45:01] <toddparker> it basically maps touch events (if seen) to mouse events and uses the first one that bubbles up
[07:45:02] <scott_gonzalez> Or how Facebook is being sued for having a news feed?
[07:45:19] <toddparker> i'm not saying that software patents aren't' nuts
[07:46:04] <toddparker> I think as a long term, goal using pointer may make sense but it seems like early days since it's draft and not implemented anywhere
[07:46:19] <toddparker> for longer term R&D, that makes a lot of sense
[07:46:25] <toddparker> which is what you're doing
[07:46:37] <toddparker> we're just wrangling the events we have now
[07:47:27] <scott_gonzalez> MSPointer isn't even a draft.
[07:47:30] <toddparker> heh
[07:47:32] <scott_gonzalez> But it IS implemented.
[07:47:40] <toddparker> in win 8?
[07:47:41] <scott_gonzalez> W3C is also seriously considering it.
[07:47:44] <scott_gonzalez> yeah
[07:48:06] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: is there anything in Windows Phone 7 you know of?
[07:48:26] <toddparker> for the next few years, mouse events will continue to be the workhorse
[07:48:27] <Wilto> scott_gonzalez: So like, is this a call to action of some sort? Should we change something?
[07:48:34] <scott_gonzalez> I'm not sure what's in WP7, I still haven't been able to get one.
[07:48:49] <scott_gonzalez> Wilto: For now, keep doing what you're doing.
[07:48:52] <Wilto> If this is worthy of a to-do, cool. If not, I mean, we’re all just agreeing that touch events are a mess in different ways.
[07:48:54] <Wilto> Cool.
[07:48:56] <toddparker> because it's the lowest common denominator across platforms and there eis a ton of code that looks for mouse events
[07:49:05] <scott_gonzalez> When there's finally a spec, we'll have an official normalization and then you can switch to that :-)
[07:49:16] <toddparker> you can layer on top touch/pointer events but it gonna be a mixed bag
[07:49:20] <scott_gonzalez> If Pointer gets specced, that's what we'll normalize to.
[07:49:21] <jzaefferer> scott_gonzalez: I got in touch with a Nokia guy yesterday, he CCed another. If that works out, I can ask for more...
[07:49:22] <Wilto> Oh, agreed for certain. For now, we’re making do with what we’ve got.
[07:49:25] <scott_gonzalez> It's nice because it's future-proof
[07:49:40] <toddparker> i think that it's more generic
[07:49:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, Mobile is doing everything it can right now.
[07:50:06] <toddparker> sort of a strategy vs. tactics situation
[07:51:03] <toddparker> anyhow…is there something specific you want us to consider for the near term or is this just a "something to think about" kind of thing?
[07:56:39] <scottjehl> hey folks
[08:00:23] <Wilto> Hey scottjehl!
[08:01:38] <toddparker> hey-o
[08:02:35] <toddparker> scottjehl: do you know where out test pages are for touch events
[08:02:53] <toddparker> i know kin had a bunch of instrumentation pages too
[08:02:54] <scottjehl> I return in search of conflicts :)
[08:02:58] <toddparker> he's not online
[08:03:05] <scottjehl> sued for touch event usage? lolwat
[08:03:37] <scottjehl> us and which million other sites :)
[08:04:02] <Wilto> That’s where I’ve got them, scottjehl—say I did it, and they can sue my broke ass. Can’t squeeze blood from a stone.
[08:09:00] <toddparker> they will take your new indiana jones boots Wilto
[08:09:07] <Wilto> NOOOO
[08:10:05] <Wilto> “It is not your money we want, Mr. Wilto. It is your fresh-to-death kicks! AH HAH HA!” Again: monocle, nefarious-looking cat, etc.
[08:15:46] <Wilto> Setting a height/width or a position value other than static on _button icons_ breaks select menus when a fixed header appears somewhere on a page—not just when a parent or sibling of the select, but anywhere.
[08:15:52] <Wilto> what i can’t i don’t even
[08:17:43] <scottjehl> I understand the hypotheticals here, but what we're doing is hardly infringing on anyone's technology. We're building on top of something Mobile Safari, Android Webkit, Chrome Android, Opera Mobile, and Mobile Firefox, all emit consistently for end-developers to use. They all document them for use in the exact way we use them. How could a web site or framework be at fault for following their guide
[08:17:43] <scottjehl> lines
[09:00:35] <Dragooon> Have you guys considered doing a true split view plugin?
[09:24:58] <Wilto> How in the name of Tim Berners-Lee does Android 2.3 support _unprefixed_ `pointer-events: none`?
[09:29:52] <toddparker> Dragooon: That requires overflow support to work well. Working on it. Have you seen overthrow?
[09:30:33] <Dragooon> toddparker: Nope
[09:30:35] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:31:01] <Dragooon> I generally use iScoll
[09:35:45] <toddparker> hope that's just for iOS apps

[09:37:32] <Wilto> Whassup, gseguin.
[09:38:22] <gseguin> I think I have a plan for the css dependencies
[09:39:02] <gseguin> I went to bed thinking about it and when I woke up I still thought it would work
[09:39:10] <gseguin> that means it has to work
[09:39:13] <Wilto> Hit me. All this time in Android23towne has me craving some good ol’ fashioned logic.
[09:39:21] <Wilto> That is a good sign.
[09:39:35] <gseguin>  //>>css: ../css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.theme.css, ../css/structure/jquery.mobile.forms.select.css
[09:39:49] <gseguin> in every file that has a css dependency
[09:40:05] <gseguin> and then I look at the dep map that contains all the files
[09:42:26] <Wilto> I dig it.
[09:43:21] <gseguin> and get all the css in order then do a uniq on that list and then concatenate
[09:44:07] <gseguin> I'm trying it out right nao!

[09:53:30] <Wilto> Aww sheeit.
[10:00:02] <jzaefferer> kinblas: You're the special events guy, right? I'm using a tap event along with pageX/Y properties. Looks like for touch-based tap, its right there, for click-based, I need to look at originalEvent
[10:00:10] <jzaefferer> Do you have a testpage for that stuff?
[10:04:18] <kinblas> jzaefferer: well I wrote the vmouse stuff, the other stuff in jquery.mobile.event.js was written by Scott G and Ben A.
[10:04:41] <kinblas> jzaefferer: I did tweak Scott's tap implementation to use the vclick event though
[10:05:13] <kinblas> the pageX and pageY probably isn't there because in vmouse I copy it on to the fake event if it is touch
[10:05:22] * kinblas checks
[10:06:26] <kinblas> jzaefferer: I guess $.Event(event) doesn't copy pageX/pageY for mouse events eh?
[10:09:58] <jzaefferer> kinblas: no idea
[10:12:29] <kinblas> jzaefferer: oh, yeah, I don't think pageX/Y is a standard mouse event property
[10:12:33] <kinblas> it's a touch event property
[10:12:59] <kinblas> jzaefferer: are you testing on desktop or on a device?
[10:13:39] <jzaefferer> kinblas: both, that's the point
[10:13:46] <jzaefferer> and pageX/Y is THE standard mouse property
[10:13:52] <jzaefferer> that was the first to get normalized by jQuery
[10:14:06] <jzaefferer> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[10:20:32] <kinblas> I meant it wasn't a standard DOM event
[10:20:44] <kinblas> jzaefferer: do you have a quick page I can load in a browser?
[10:21:08] <kinblas> the vmouse event code looks like it's copying all the props off of the original (jquery event)
[10:21:15] <jzaefferer> pretty sure pageX/Y are part of the DOM spec
[10:21:50] <jzaefferer> I'll put together a jsbin
[10:21:51] <kinblas> this says it's proprietary
[10:21:52] <kinblas> http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#webidl-events-MouseEvent
[10:23:22] <jzaefferer> looks like it works with 1.6.4., but breaks with 1.7.1 :/
[10:23:35] <jzaefferer> http://jsbin.com/agibum/edit#javascript,html
[10:24:34] <jzaefferer> okay, well, its still the most useful event property...
[10:27:59] <jzaefferer> kinblas: in that jsbin, when you replace jQuery 1.7.1 with 1.6.4, it works
[10:29:05] <kinblas> jzaefferer: what I was going to verify with your sample is if in vmouse.js at the point where we copy properties ... if pageX/Y is actually on the event we were given
[10:29:22] <jzaefferer> it is on event.originalEvent
[10:29:43] <kinblas> strange because there's a loop that copies properties off the event to the virtual event
[10:29:57] <jzaefferer> http://jsbin.com/agibum/2/edit
[10:30:23] <jzaefferer> also weird that its triggered twice
[10:31:14] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.vmouse.js#L29
[10:31:23] <kinblas> maybe mouseHooks.props changed?
[10:31:33] <kinblas> $.event.mouseHooks.props that is
[10:32:09] <jzaefferer> could be, as there's a difference between 1.6.4 and 1.7.1
[10:32:18] <jzaefferer> should ping DaveMethvin about that
[10:35:14] <kinblas> jzaefferer: Looks like someone modified vmouse to use those mouseHooks
[10:35:24] <kinblas> I didn't recall adding that
[10:35:34] <kinblas> but it might have been for 1.7.x support?
[10:36:00] <kinblas> in jqm 1.0, I was copying all properties
[10:36:12] <kinblas> in jqm 1.1 someone modified it to use mouseHook props
[10:38:18] <gseguin> johnbender: do you have admin rights on our repo ?
[10:39:49] <jzaefferer> kinblas: I was testing 1.0, so maybe its already fixed in master
[10:39:53] <jzaefferer> sounds like it
[10:40:06] <kinblas> jzaefferer: yeah probably, master runs against 1.7.x
[10:40:08] <jzaefferer> should've tested with 1.1rc1 to start with :/
[10:40:13] <kinblas> if you're using 1.0 we only support 1.6.4
[10:40:38] <kinblas> jzaefferer: 1.7.x definitely had an impact on jqm event-wise
[10:41:14] <jzaefferer> kinblas: that doesn't look any better: http://jsbin.com/agibum/5/edit#source
[10:42:57] <kinblas> jzaefferer: hope you don't mind I'm removing the .min in your includes

[10:55:50] <jzaefferer> when he's on fire?
[10:57:04] <jzaefferer> kinblas: any idea what's going on?
[10:57:39] <kinblas> jzaefferer: I'm looking at it, I had to make a local copy so I can break on click
[10:57:51] <kinblas> mousedown seems to have the actual pageX/Y on it
[10:57:57] <kinblas> and it is listed in the props to copy
[10:58:04] <kinblas> so I need to check click to see what the deal is
[10:58:17] <kinblas> jzaefferer: give me a few minutes
[10:58:49] <jzaefferer> okay, thanks
[11:00:25] <kinblas> jzaefferer: aha!! I  see the problem
[11:01:16] <kinblas> jzaefferer: it's a problem with that code I mentioned earlier that was added by someone else
[11:01:17] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.vmouse.js#L71
[11:01:32] <kinblas> it's looking for events that start with "mouse" and "click" doesn't start with "mouse" :-)
[11:03:02] <kinblas> jzaefferer: yup that was it, I'll check in a fix.
[11:03:16] <kinblas> jzaefferer: is there an issue filed?
