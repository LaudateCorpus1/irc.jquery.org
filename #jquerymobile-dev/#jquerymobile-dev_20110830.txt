[08:41:42] <todd_> hey all!
[08:43:28] <_nickel> todd_: hey, so one interesting tidbit
[08:43:54] <_nickel> position: absolute on the page directly doesn't seem to cause a problem
[08:44:00] <_nickel> still need to test more though
[08:46:09] <_nickel> todd_: sorry, lies
[08:46:18] <todd_> I think there must be something else happening, like I mentioned
[08:46:23] <_nickel> todd_: yah
[08:46:38] <todd_> looks like we're too rigid on the nesting depth somewhere
[08:46:39] <_nickel> todd_: I keep forgetting it will wrap the form with a page if I don't define one
[08:46:52] <todd_> right. automagic
[08:58:46] <_nickel> todd_: well except that it still breaks when you set data-role none
[08:58:56] <_nickel> todd_: meaning that we don't even touch it with js
[09:00:07] <_nickel> todd_: the css is pretty minimal in my test so far
[09:00:14] <_nickel> still more to strip out though
[09:03:49] <todd_> k
[09:03:52] <todd_> lemme know
[09:08:09] <_nickel> todd_: http://jsbin.com/onixay/edit#javascript,html
[09:08:10] <_nickel> bam
[09:09:38] <_nickel>  todd_ scottjehl_ removing either of the style attributes on the form or the div[id=foo] fixes the issue
[09:10:01] <_nickel> has nothing to do with jqm
[09:10:08] <_nickel> to the bug reportzeses
[09:11:28] <_nickel> todd_: scottjehl_: http://jsbin.com/onixay/2/edit
[09:11:35] <_nickel> can you confirm that works on a 2.1 device
[09:11:40] <_nickel> it doesn't work on my 2.3
[09:11:46] * _nickel took out extra tags
[09:12:48] <_nickel> also another set of eyes on it would be good to make sure I'm not doing anything stupid before I submit the bug
[09:16:59] <_nickel> http://jsbin.com/onixay/3/edit#javascript,html
[09:18:33] <_nickel> apparently its any block level tag
[09:18:39] <_nickel> since spans don't seem to suffer
[09:22:22] <_nickel> until display: block is applied
[09:22:31] * _nickel is talking to himself
[09:22:44] <_nickel> http://troll.me/images/forever-alone/-forever-alone.jpg
[09:23:24] <_nickel> it doesn't affect the body tag though
[09:23:31] <_nickel> which brings up an interesting question!
[09:23:38] <_nickel> is the body tag a block level element
[09:23:42] * _nickel goes to the googles
[09:24:35] <_nickel> it appears from the first result that the body tag is not, and that you must have a block level element inside it
[09:24:42] * _nickel is live learning on irc
[09:34:26] <_nickel> gseguin: do you have a 2.2 device?
[09:34:36] * gseguin looks
[09:35:01] <_nickel> todd_: if you have a 2.2 device it would be great to test that too to include in the bug report
[09:36:14] <gseguin> I haven't been following
[09:36:25] <gseguin> I'm jiving today
[09:36:36] <gseguin> but I can run a test once that thing boots
[09:37:46] <gseguin> it was really out of juice so it may take a little time to start
[09:37:51] <gseguin> I'll ping you
[09:38:05] <_nickel> gseguin: thansk much sir!
[09:38:07] <_nickel> *thanks
[09:38:50] <_nickel> todd_: scottjehl_ http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=19688
[09:39:51] <gseguin> _nickel: I got another one
[09:40:02] <gseguin> _nickel: where do I point my browser?
[09:40:18] <gseguin> the troll.me site or the jsbin.com one ?
[09:40:20] <gseguin> :P
[09:41:25] <todd_> thanks fro filing that bug _nickel
[09:42:13] <gseguin> _nickel: with http://jsbin.com/onixay/3 I get a select that is unclickable
[09:43:10] <todd_> gseguin - on Android?
[09:43:19] <gseguin> yup
[09:43:25] <todd_> that's supposed to show the issue so it not working is good
[09:43:35] <todd_> _nickel - that right?
[10:01:34] <_nickel> gseguin: jsbin :D
[10:01:40] <_nickel> gseguin: thats correct
[10:02:38] <gseguin> glad I could help
[10:16:08] <kinblas> _nickel: not sure if you said you were going to take care of that ipv6 issue or not, but the regexp modification looks good to me
[10:32:37] <_nickel> kinblas: alright I'm on it
[10:47:59] <todd_> thanks guys
[10:48:17] <todd_> kinblas - scott said you and he figured out a god extensibility hook last night
[10:48:20] <todd_> good news
[10:49:25] <kinblas> todd_: well, it's more of a least amount of work with an existing event hook ... which may be enough for folks for now
[10:49:26] <_nickel> scottjehl_: todd_ kinblas "god extensibility" amazing
[10:52:12] <kinblas> todd_: so are you guys using scott's drive-in for testing jqm?
[10:59:49] <_nickel> is it just me or has the replacestate thing been quiet ?
[11:00:00] <_nickel> I suppose that will go crazy when we land b3
[11:10:05] <_nickel> kinblas: did you look at the rfc for, or do you already hold in your vast intelect and stores of knowledge, the "right way" to deal with ipv6?
[11:13:31] <kinblas> _nickel: I know the basic format of the ipv6 server reference
[11:13:40] <kinblas> it's a bracket with hex and colons
[11:13:49] <kinblas> we're not necessarly enforcing format
[11:13:56] <_nickel> kinblas: I'm wondering if we should curtail it to sets of 4 hex
[11:14:02] <_nickel> that was my question
[11:14:12] <_nickel> I guess we're not validating
[11:14:16] <_nickel> so thats pointless
[11:14:21] <_nickel> I SHALL MERGE!
[11:14:25] <kinblas> _nickel: http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt
[11:14:34] <kinblas> some of the colons can be blank
[11:14:47] <kinblas> oh hmmm
[11:14:51] <kinblas> he's missing '.' I think
[11:15:04] <_nickel> hmm yah
[11:15:09] <_nickel> kinblas: I'll handle it
[11:15:12] <_nickel> and let you know
[11:15:12] <kinblas> We want to make sure we handle at least those examples
[11:15:15] <_nickel> yah
[11:15:17] <kinblas> I was thinking
[11:15:20] <_nickel> I'll write tests for them
[11:15:35] <kinblas> \[[^\]]+\]
[11:15:39] <kinblas> was good enough
[11:15:50] <kinblas> for our purposes at least
[11:17:07] <_nickel> is the bracket an otherwise invalide char in the domain
[11:17:08] <_nickel> kinblas: http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1808
[11:17:17] <_nickel> it looks like from the netloc gramar def
[11:17:28] <_nickel> *net_loc
[11:19:23] <kinblas> heh brackets are in national, but not used in the grammar?
[11:19:59] <kinblas> _nickel: honestly, I think we'll be fine with \[[^\]]+\]
[11:20:36] <kinblas> I haven't seen a good grammar description of an ipv6 net_loc yet
[11:22:14] <kinblas> I did see this though
[11:22:15] <kinblas> http://www.ietf.org/proceedings/62/slides/ipv6-6.pdf
[11:24:55] <kinblas> _nickel: try this one:
[11:24:56] <kinblas> http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt
[11:25:53] <kinblas> _nickel: yeah rfc3986 is the right one
[11:28:39] <kinblas> _nickel: so it looks like you can embed an ipv4 address in an ipv6 address so yeah we need the dot
[11:33:06] <kinblas> _nickel: hmmm also percents
[11:41:00] <_nickel> kinblas: now I'm glad I asked
[11:41:11] <_nickel> as a side note I'm making progress on the CI
[11:41:18] <_nickel> I uploaded an iso to the esx server
[11:41:38] <_nickel> just need to bootstrap chef
[11:41:46] <_nickel> and then hopefully the recipe will behave nicely
[11:43:10] <kinblas> coolio
[11:43:16] <kinblas> perhaps something today?
[11:43:24] <_nickel> kinblas: we'll se
[11:44:38] <kinblas> _nickel: are you familiar with how to make an apache instance running on a PC accessible to a device?
[11:45:04] <_nickel> kinblas: no but if you're interested in running vagrant it handles the networking for you :D
[11:45:04] <kinblas> I'm getting forbidden .. so I must have to set some config flags somewhere
[11:45:19] <_nickel> I connect to my laptop for testing over the wan
[11:45:22] <_nickel> err wlan
[11:45:23] <kinblas> does vagrant run only on linux?
[11:45:27] <_nickel> kinblas: nope
[11:45:37] <kinblas> what do  I need to set u
[11:45:38] <kinblas> up
[11:45:38] <_nickel> kinblas: mac, linux, and windows
[11:45:40] <_nickel> :D
[11:45:47] <_nickel> kinblas: would you like to try the new installer I created?
[11:46:12] <_nickel> kinblas: otherwise its pretty simple
[11:46:21] <_nickel> kinblas: first thing, download and install virtualbox
[12:30:41] <todd_> hey kinblas - how the new hook we're adding help with that microsoft issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2283#issuecomment-1946170
[12:30:42] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #2283 on jquery-mobile, reported by SteveSanderson (2w, 1d ago): Ajax navigation breaks navigation to non-jQuery-Mobile pages
[12:31:23] <todd_> seems like they could write some code to analyze the ajax response and either let it flow as jQM or bust it into a new refresh
[12:31:34] <todd_> still ugly as hell b/c you load it twice for desktop
[12:56:12] * _nickel is making progress on the ci server
[12:56:20] <_nickel> trying to export a chef-server base
[13:02:21] <kinblas> todd_: ugh, MS still wants client-side evaluation of JQM pages?
[13:03:07] <kinblas> todd_: I suppose they could use this same approach ... just so you know the approach is basically this:
[13:03:19] <kinblas> we already fire off beforechangepage and changepage events
[13:04:07] <kinblas> What we want to do is make it so that beforechangepage is a preventDefault type of event ... where the default is our normal handling.
[13:04:39] <kinblas> That way they can catch beforechangepage, scan the args being given, and then decide to do some alternate handling, or let the default handling execute.
[13:06:37] <gseguin> Can we add an option to listview to disable nested lists?
[13:07:07] <gseguin> kinblas, _nickel: ^^^
[13:07:31] <kinblas> gseguin: what happens in the disabled case?
[13:07:37] <eddiemonge> gseguin: what tablets do you own?
[13:07:51] <gseguin> we don't call _createSubPages
[13:08:21] <gseguin> eddiemonge: iPad 2, Galaxy, TouchPad, Playbook, Xoom
[13:08:42] <gseguin> kinblas: the reason I'm asking is that
[13:08:57] <gseguin> right now a list needs to have a parent page
[13:09:02] <gseguin> to be enhanaced
[13:09:02] <kinblas> gseguin: hmmm that might have some mouse event ramifications
[13:09:27] <gseguin> so you can't enhance something that you haven't attached yet
[13:09:42] <kinblas> gseguin: that said, I know scott and todd have mentioned that the nested lists thing was a pain that we should probably have punted on
[13:10:01] <kinblas> ... the auto paging of nested lists I meant
[13:10:30] <kinblas> but I know folks find that to be a great/exciting feature
[13:10:34] <gseguin> I'll try to catch todd or scott
[13:10:48] <gseguin> ( I know, right? )
[13:11:03] <gseguin> when it's a PITA to handle all the corner cases
[13:11:05] <kinblas> gseguin: my concern has to do with the resulting nested list items
[13:11:21] <kinblas> and the way they forward events, etc
[13:11:23] <gseguin> oh but I just want an option
[13:11:56] <kinblas> gseguin: does it *NOT* enhance nested lists at all?
[13:11:58] <gseguin> if the option is there then I change the behaviour
[13:12:09] <gseguin> it throws
[13:12:20] <gseguin> if the listview is not attached to a page
[13:12:35] <gseguin> because of: parentId  = parentUrl || parentPage[ 0 ][ $.expando ],
[13:12:46] * gseguin will be right back
[13:12:55] <kinblas> gseguin: oh so you're still letting it enhance and split out nested lists?
[13:13:48] <kinblas> I guess what I'm asking for is the expectations of what nestedListViewsEnabled: false is
[13:14:23] <todd_> If I could re-do things, nested lists would never be
[13:14:29] <todd_> *hate* them
[13:14:43] <todd_> they are a cool dev convenience, but they really break in a ot of cases
[13:15:19] <todd_> gseguin - why don't you just make pages, multi-page style
[13:15:52] <todd_> nested lists don't offer you the same control as actualy pages - header can't be templated, etc.
[13:15:58] <todd_> kinblas -
[13:16:13] <todd_> i get what you mean by the new hook concept. i like
[13:16:31] <todd_> that whole thing is typical MSFT
[13:17:02] <kinblas> todd_: yeah it's easy for us, we just need to pass in an event to our trigger call, and then check the event after the call to see if preventDefault() was called on it ... if so, return ... end of story.
[13:17:14] <kinblas> very basic, but allows for folks to hook in without a monkey-patch
[13:18:49] <kinblas> todd_: also I think folks can use this same mechanism to decode URLs too ... but I'll have to code an example of what I'm thinking ... we can probably leverage the changepage event too for encoding it.
[13:39:23] <todd_> nice kinblas
[13:39:32] <todd_> is scott working on landing that or is that you?
[13:40:07] <kinblas> todd_: He said he was going to try and work on it on the plane.
[13:40:22] <kinblas> I pointed him to an example of what I was talking about in vmouse.js
[13:46:35] <gseguin> sorry guys I had to help out on debugging a problem
[13:46:41] * gseguin catching up
[13:47:33] <gseguin> kinblas: it would be more of a data-* attr we could do it on a per list basis
[13:49:08] <gseguin> todd_: The problem we're having right now is that we build the list in a document fragment and try to enhance it and it throws
[13:52:51] <kinblas> gseguin: hmm is the exception something new?
[13:53:06] <gseguin> no, not new
[13:53:15] <gseguin> we're just doing new things
[13:53:21] * kinblas wonders why we never saw it before
[13:53:24] <gseguin> and I discovered that
[13:54:23] <gseguin> well it's not very by the book to even create the ul in a doc fragment and call .listview() on that docfragment
[13:57:35] * gseguin has to go to a meeting
[16:08:41] <kinblas> _nickel: congrats, that regexp looks even hairier
