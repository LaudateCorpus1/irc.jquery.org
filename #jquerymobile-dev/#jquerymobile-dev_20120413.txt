[06:00:53] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3980 on jquery-mobile (konrado; 6d, 3h ago): 1.1 RC2, Android, data-rel back doesn't work correctly in some cases
[06:54:34] <tbenzige> hey toddparker. jqm.com's home page still has RC2 as it's latest stable build: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/39062097/jqm_screenshot.png
[06:54:55] <tbenzige> link is correct though
[07:22:53] <toddparker> thanks fixed
[07:24:13] <Wilto> Wooyeah, 1.1.
[07:24:16] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/victory.mp3
[08:03:11] <deAtog> I got a false positive on issue 3980 using the test provided by the user. It seems issue 3980 is due to the use of AJAX requests with pushState enabled
[08:29:50] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I'll tag
[08:35:03] <gseguin> Wilto: is todd around?
[08:50:35] <Wilto> Gseguin: Meetings this morning. What’s up?
[08:51:04] <gseguin> I was wondering if there was any reason to hold off on tagging and branching
[09:12:39] <gseguin> johnbender: ping
[09:14:14] <johnbender> gseguin: pong
[09:14:32] <johnbender> gseguin: I can push the tag if you like :D
[09:14:49] <gseguin> yeah and create the branch maybe?
[09:15:09] <gseguin> on Jive assignments today
[09:15:16] <johnbender> gseguin: tag pushed cutting the 1.1-stable
[09:16:30] <johnbender> I just pushed the 1.1-stable branch to github
[09:16:39] <johnbender> am I green to merge 1.2 into master?
[09:23:58] <Wilto> Go team.
[09:25:38] <toddparker> tbenzige: someone is saying the TR zip is missing the loader gif
[09:25:41] <toddparker> checking now
[09:25:52] <toddparker> johnbender: yep, think so
[09:26:51] <toddparker> johnbender: see this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4031#issuecomment-5116995
[09:26:52] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4031 on jquery-mobile (uGoMobi; 1h, 12m ago): 1.1.0 final code snippet on download page and in blog announcement
[09:28:40] <toddparker> "I just noticed that besides the 1.1.0 final, the 1.1.0-RC2 files are included in the ZIP file. Is this intentional?"
[09:30:33] <gseguin> johnbender: green light here
[09:32:51] <toddparker> tbenzige: yikes, the new TR does include loader.png and it should be loader.gif
[09:52:27] <gseguin> Wilto: pushed an update to the builder page, you can now build from either 1.1-stable or master
[09:53:09] <gseguin> btw I tested a custom bundle last night and it worked (ok after I did one fix to the build params)!
[09:54:28] <johnbender> gseguin: lol

[09:59:38] <gseguin> how about landing popup too
[09:59:39] <gseguin> ?
[09:59:50] <gseguin> thanks johnbender !
[10:00:54] <Wilto> Sweet.
[10:01:11] <johnbender> from some reason I don't see 1.1-stable on master
[10:01:13] <johnbender> on github
[10:01:18] <johnbender> though it tells me it's up to date
[10:02:21] <gseguin> it's there
[10:02:39] <gseguin> I checked it out a minute ago in the builder
[10:02:44] <johnbender> odd
[10:02:50] <johnbender> it just doesn't show up on the branches page
[10:02:56] <gseguin> http://ghislain.dyndns.biz/jqm/builder/
[10:03:27] <johnbender> nice
[10:16:25] <Wilto> God, that’s cool.
[10:17:11] <Wilto> So what’s left? Stylin’ that select up nice, moving the front end to the jquerymobile.com server… That it?
[10:17:18] <Wilto> We could get this sucker alpha-ready today.
[10:18:28] <toddparker> that builder looks sweet
[10:18:39] <toddparker> let fix the drop down and alpha this sucker
[10:19:03] <Wilto> ?SHIPIT

[10:26:27] <toddparker> gseguin: log issues here, right? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile-builder
[10:26:44] <gseguin> yeah I guess so
[10:36:52] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #1,680: FAILURE in 28 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/1680/
[10:36:53] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * pavel.zubkou: Use  option name in calls to changePage()
[10:36:53] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * pavel.zubkou: Get rid of a floating function
[10:36:54] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: add suites back in that were removed for debugging at some point
[10:36:54] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * jblas: Fix for issue #3707 - iOS4 reports landscape when it's in portrait
[10:36:54] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: Update cached copy of data-url when page already exists in DOM.
[10:36:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: The button's text should preserve the original css class of the select and the selected option. This way you can customize it with i.e. images.
[10:36:56] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: refactor to addClass to avoid array alterations/joins
[10:36:56] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: simplify button text method, handle persisting option class for multiple selects
[10:46:51] <deAtog> in the future can you all be a little more diligent about not breaking the master branch? I'm finding it rather difficult to bisect an issue that occurred between 1.0 and 1.1 rc1
[10:48:41] <johnbender> deAtog: ?
[10:49:28] <johnbender> deAtog: you can rest assured that we aren't doing that on purpose
[10:53:12] <Wilto> Wait. _Don’t_ break master, you’re saying.
[10:53:36] <deAtog> johnbender: I suspect not.. but developers should completely test their code before committing it.. there are many revisions between 1.0 and 1.1 rc that are simply untestable
[10:53:54] <Wilto> Will do, bro.
[10:54:55] <toddparker> we just pushed a bunch of stuff that was in a branch while we finished 1.1 so that can happen with such a complex merge
[10:55:16] <johnbender> deAtog: we have a test suite size/speed problem that prevents that from being practical
[10:55:43] <johnbender> also at some point that will be virtually impossible given the number of browsers that are slated for automated testing
[10:56:11] <johnbender> deAtog: if you feel compelled to fix the problem I welcome patches to speed up the test suite
[10:56:40] <deAtog> johnbender: by "break" I mean it should at minimum compile and render properly
[10:56:47] <johnbender> deAtog: ?
[10:57:34] <johnbender> deAtog: can you make a list of shas that don't?
[10:58:02] <johnbender> I've done a few bisects since 1.0 and I haven't had that issue
[11:00:14] <deAtog> hrm.. maybe its a jquery version issue then.. jQuery 1.7.1 with 1.0 works.. and jQuery 1.7.1 works with 1.1.0 rc1 but I get several revisions in between that simply fail to render
[11:01:35] <johnbender> deAtog: we didn't support 1.7 until some time in between
[11:01:36] <johnbender> ...
[11:01:45] <johnbender> 1.0 only supports 1.6.4
[11:03:45] <deAtog> I considered that as well.. I downgraded to that version and it still wouldn't render
[11:03:58] <deAtog> where do I get "external/r.js/dist/r.js" from?
[11:04:29] <johnbender> deAtog: if you want to do bisecting/development I would avoid doing the builds
[11:04:51] <johnbender> do your testing in a browser, otherwise if you can please log your issue on github so we can deal with it as normal
[11:05:09] <johnbender> that is, a browser with a web server
[11:05:16] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #1,681: STILL FAILING in 28 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/1681/
[11:06:01] <deAtog> johnbender: the issue is in git-hub, I was just trying to track down what caused it.. it's not present in 1.0, but is present in 1.1 rc1 and above

[11:08:20] <johnbender> deAtog: it sounds like you have two seperate issues, 1) whatever you are trying to track down 2) some problem with the bisect you are attempting to do
[11:08:42] <johnbender> if you can take the time to sort exactly what it is, and log said issue on github we can try and get to it when we have time

[11:19:31] <deAtog> what OS do you all develop on?
[11:22:06] <deAtog> some of the old Makefiles reference a program called "node".. where does that come from?
[11:38:24] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!

[11:48:18] <deAtog> thanks, I found it
[11:55:40] <toddparker> johnbender: did you see that issue come in where the zip on the CDN has the RC2 files in it in addition to 1.0
[11:56:14] <toddparker> ^^ oops meant to say 1.1 files
[11:56:27] <toddparker> so it's not broken (you get the 1.1 files) but it's confusing the rc2 ones are there too
[11:56:55] <toddparker> and you get both he ajax-loader.gif and .png
[11:57:09] <toddparker> 1.0.x = png
[11:57:15] <toddparker> 1.1 = gif
[12:00:48] <johnbender> toddparker: nope I didn't
[12:00:53] <johnbender> :/
[12:01:11] <johnbender> well it's possible I did but I though it was tr specific
[12:01:14] <johnbender> I'll take a look

[12:05:27] <toddparker> talking to microsoft re: hackathon
[12:12:57] <Wilto> In 1.2, the loading gif will be replaced with http://wil.to/_/runningman.gif
[12:13:18] <Wilto> Plan accordingly.
[12:30:50] <toddparker> johnbender: you figure out the zip thing?
[12:31:05] <toddparker> it's a BOGO release: download 1.1, get rc2 FREE
[12:31:30] <Wilto> A steal at twice the price.
[12:35:39] <johnbender> toddparker: waiting for the cdn to refresh but yes
[12:37:25] <johnbender> toddparker: appears to be resolved
[12:37:49] <johnbender> though chrome appears to be a bit aggresive about the cached results :(

[13:32:35] <gseguin> cool, I'll update

[13:36:41] <gseguin> when did that happen?
[13:36:46] <Wilto> Partyin’ like it’s 1999.
[13:36:48] <Wilto> Just did it.
[13:36:54] <gseguin> AWESOME!
[13:37:38] <Wilto> And hold on to your hats because it’s GOING INTO THE DOCS
[13:38:01] <gseguin> we can probably pull that info from the repo now
[13:38:23] <gseguin> and for jQM, we can pull it from $.mobile.version
[13:38:37] <gseguin> nice!
[13:39:24] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, good call.
[13:39:29] <gseguin> as Wilto would say: http://wil.to/_/awesome.jpg
[13:39:49] <Wilto> the most awesome image ever
[13:45:53] <johnbender> who is the old woman?
[13:46:11] <toddparker> http://codiqa.com/ is sweet. you can paste in TR theme CSS and use it on the fly. Also already working with 1.1
[13:46:11] <Wilto> Paula Deen, inexplicably.

[13:58:50] <gseguin> OH Wilto you used a b tag?
[13:59:04] <gseguin> wouldn't strong be more semantic?
[13:59:07] <Wilto> “Stylistically offset from surrounding text without conveying additional importance.”
[14:00:11] <Wilto> “1.1” is just as important as “final.”
[14:00:27] <Wilto> I…
[14:00:30] <Wilto> I hate <b>.
[14:00:31] <Wilto> I do.
[14:00:37] <Wilto> It has stupid semantics THERE I SAID IT
[14:01:25] <gseguin> I didn't know you felt that <b>strongly/<b> about it
