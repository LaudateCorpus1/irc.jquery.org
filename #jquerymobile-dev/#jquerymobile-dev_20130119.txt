[06:33:55] <uGoMobi> morning arschmitz 
[06:35:32] <arschmitz> hey uGoMobi
[06:35:49] <arschmitz> been working on a lot of demo stuff with toddmparker:
[06:36:06] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah I saw that
[06:36:07] <uGoMobi> nice
[06:36:58] <arschmitz> i was hoping to get your help on fixing up the faq formating enough so that the structure is at least set and worry about css later
[06:37:08] <arschmitz> so we can start transfering stuff in there
[06:37:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i need to run right now to go get a haircut but if your around a bit latter
[06:38:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I won't be here all day but probably catch you later
[06:38:34] <uGoMobi> so we can work on that
[06:39:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool incase you have a second before we catch up again here is a link to what i have now but it does not look good lol http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/faq/docs/demos/faq/changing-css-on-form-element-does-not-work.html
[06:39:39] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: see you later
[06:39:45] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok later

[09:09:36] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 1452c6c2f 15Alexander Schmitz: Demos: update listview autodivider bar to account for footer
[09:41:57] <agcolom> arschmitz: Hi Alex! Thanks a lot for the great start on that demo! I've tried on the iPad and say you touch H, then touch F, the whole page (including the panel) moves down, so you get a large empty space avove the A
[09:44:58] <arschmitz> agcolom: ok ill check that out
[09:45:36] <arschmitz> on thing on iphone ipad is it reflows the bar after scroll because they dont execute javascript on scroll only after so i probably need to take that into account
[09:46:29] <agcolom> right... 
[09:47:03] <arschmitz> iv only really tested on desktop so far
[09:48:24] <arschmitz> agcolom: what ipad ios are you on im not seeing that on ios6 ipad 2?
[09:48:41] <agcolom> I've tried on iOS 5, iPad 3
[09:48:57] <agcolom> I can try also iOS 4, iPad 2
[09:49:14] <arschmitz> thats fine i only checked ios6 ipad 2 
[09:49:30] <arschmitz> also have an ios5 ipad 2 here so it should happen on that
[09:50:39] <agcolom> sometimes, I can't seem to click/touch the letter in the list... but not sure yet how to be able to reproduce 100%
[09:51:26] <arschmitz> oh yeah i see problem on ios5
[09:51:36] <agcolom> yes, I think the reflow is causing other issues... might be best to fix this first and retest...
[09:51:42] <arschmitz> it dose not move the link bar just like you said
[09:51:57] <arschmitz> must be something they fixed with ios 6
[09:52:04] <agcolom> maybe...
[09:53:02] <arschmitz> oh i know what it is
[09:53:19] <arschmitz> agcolom: silent scroll and fixed position are completely broken on ios5
[09:53:43] <arschmitz> we have a fix for it in the fixedtoolbars.workarounds extension i wrote
[09:54:04] <arschmitz> but that page does not use fixedToolbars so its not active
[09:54:14] <agcolom> ok... that is sad :-( (but nice that you have a fix ;-) )
[09:54:30] <arschmitz> yeah easy thing will just be to use a fixed header
[09:54:42] <agcolom> that's just as I was going to suggest ;-)
[09:55:10] <arschmitz> yeah and the silent scroll issue was fixed in ios6
[09:55:15] <arschmitz> so that all makes sense lol
[09:55:20] <agcolom> yes...
[09:55:38] <arschmitz> so is that basicly what you had in mind for the demo though?
[09:56:06] <agcolom> yes, it is axectly what I had in mind! That's really spot on!
[09:56:12] <agcolom> exactly^
[09:56:13] <arschmitz> awesome
[09:56:41] <agcolom> great minds .... ;-)
[09:56:42] <arschmitz> it looks really good on desktop because the link bar adjusts for the header and foter just like in ios
[09:56:59] <agcolom> brilliant! 
[09:57:13] <arschmitz> sadly since ios wont execute JS durring scroll it snaps into place when you stop moving
[09:58:04] <arschmitz> agcolom: it was actually really easy to make it work with the auto dividers it was a good idea
[10:00:34] <arschmitz> agcolom: and you gave me my first project to do on my new MAc :)
[10:02:19] <agcolom> eh, that's pretty cool ;-)
[10:02:27] <agcolom> so do you like your new mac?
[10:02:32] <arschmitz> yes very much
[10:02:47] <arschmitz> still getting used to it but i like it a lot
[10:02:48] <agcolom> they are beautiful machines! 
[10:03:03] <arschmitz> yes much better then using my wifes PINK vaio
[10:03:06] <arschmitz> lol
[10:03:30] <agcolom> well, I like pink but yeah Mac books are great! 
[10:03:54] <arschmitz> lol yeah i just dont think pink suits me very well not really a pink sorta guy lol
[10:04:49] <agcolom> yes, I can see that ;-)
[10:06:05] <agcolom> btw, make sure you enjoy your child free time while you can.... (i.e. dinner out, cinema, theatre... ) 
[10:06:32] <arschmitz> lol not much of that left march 10th is the due date :)
[10:06:38] <agcolom> it will be much more difficult to do that for a while when baby arrives, unless you have family near you?
[10:06:44] <arschmitz> my wife is at the baby shower right now
[10:06:53] <arschmitz> yeah we have a lot of family which is good
[10:07:09] <arschmitz> my mom is super excited to be a grandmother lol 
[10:07:22] <agcolom> That's great! We had nobody here (all the family is in France! ) so it was not easy!
[10:07:40] <agcolom> that's really nice :-)
[10:07:48] <arschmitz> yeah all of our family is within a 45 minute drive which is nice
[10:08:16] <agcolom> you should be fine then ;-)
[10:08:39] <arschmitz> helps he will be the first grandchild on both sides too :)

[16:41:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: you around?
[16:41:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes
[16:41:51] <arschmitz> that 1px shift issue is intresting completely isolated to os x safari it seems
[16:41:53] <uGoMobi> finished a small battle with a panel unit test
[16:42:02] <arschmitz> i saw your commit on that
[16:42:52] <arschmitz> im working on a deeplinking demo
[16:42:54] <uGoMobi> took me a while before I figured it out... but I succeeded :)
[16:42:59] <uGoMobi> cool
[16:43:00] <arschmitz> nice !
[16:43:18] <arschmitz> realized last night i never commited the deeplinking functions to demos
[16:43:34] <arschmitz> they are there now just adding a demo to show how to use them. 
[16:43:48] <uGoMobi> ah right
[16:44:11] <uGoMobi> was a nice solution I remember
[16:44:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: do you have a MacBook Pro Retina?
[16:44:54] <uGoMobi> or non Retina?
[16:44:54] <arschmitz> yes
[16:44:58] <arschmitz> retina
[16:45:02] <uGoMobi> ok
[16:45:10] <arschmitz> thnking the 1px is a retina issue?
[16:45:54] <uGoMobi> I dunno... just looking for a connection between the devices you can reproduce the issue on
[16:46:13] <arschmitz> i can try my iphone thats retina too
[16:46:53] <uGoMobi> but I also checked on a retina device and don't see the problem
[16:47:09] <arschmitz> oh yeah ipad retina 
[16:47:13] <arschmitz> not sure
[16:47:22] <arschmitz> i couldnt make it happen on ipad either
[16:47:37] <uGoMobi> weird
[16:47:45] <arschmitz> but its a non retina ipad
[16:47:51] <uGoMobi> btw - I like how he submits issues
[16:47:54] <arschmitz> but it is 6.0.2
[16:48:03] <uGoMobi> and test page
[16:48:24] <uGoMobi> I tested 6.0.1
[16:48:39] <arschmitz> yeah he thanked us for being so quick on issues on twitter last nihgt
[16:48:49] <uGoMobi> ah cool
[16:48:57] <arschmitz> i thanked him for submitting such complete issues
[16:50:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: can you reproduce the 1px in safari on your mac?
[16:50:30] <uGoMobi> I don't have a mac
[16:50:38] <uGoMobi> I have Linux and Windows
[16:50:38] <arschmitz> oh ok sorry i thought you did
[16:50:59] <arschmitz> yeah i have everything now lol
[16:51:10] <uGoMobi> nice

[16:51:51] <arschmitz> since ill have a WP soon lol
[16:52:11] <uGoMobi> yeah that's very cool of microsoft!
[16:52:13] <arschmitz> blackberry is the only major thing i dont have now
[16:52:30] <uGoMobi> I was looking at some test devices too
[16:52:50] <arschmitz> its so much easier with issue triage if you have actual devices
[16:52:52] <uGoMobi> need a new Android 2.3 device and want BB too
[16:53:09] <uGoMobi> those are not that expensive
[16:53:15] <arschmitz> yeah i lucked out on 2.3 got a nice HTC thunderbolt free
[16:53:21] <uGoMobi> BB Curve will do
[16:53:26] <arschmitz> yup
[16:53:31] <uGoMobi> ah cool
[16:53:48] <uGoMobi> had a Samsung S2 but totally screwed that one up

[17:01:18] <uGoMobi> lol
[17:18:36] <toddmparker___> hey all
[17:18:44] <uGoMobi> hi toddmparker___ 
[17:18:48] <toddmparker___> looks like you've been busy
[17:18:50] <toddmparker___> hey uGoMobi 
[17:19:19] <toddmparker___> i just looked at the panels pages on iOS6 on master and fixed headers do so odd stuff
[17:19:26] <toddmparker___> like, woah
[17:20:30] <uGoMobi> oh oh
[17:20:30] <toddmparker___> when i scroll, the URL bar chrome scrolls up over clock then away
[17:20:56] <arschmitz> hi toddmparker___
[17:20:58] <toddmparker___> the clock never comes back but the space there allows you to see the page
[17:21:02] <toddmparker___> hey arschmitz 
[17:21:22] <toddmparker___> i...didn't know these kinds of things were possible
[17:21:25] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: thats kinda crazy
[17:21:33] <toddmparker___> you see that?
[17:21:39] <arschmitz> yeah i didnt think we could do that if you wanted to
[17:21:53] <uGoMobi> checking now
[17:21:55] <arschmitz> no i dont have a phone with ios6 only ipad
[17:22:05] <arschmitz> im going to look at browser stack
[17:22:16] <toddmparker___> i see it here on my iphone 5 - http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/panels/index.html
[17:22:24] <toddmparker___> and the fixed toolbar panel page
[17:22:42] <uGoMobi> on Safari?
[17:24:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: works fine here
[17:25:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: yeah works fine on browserstack not that that really means much
[17:25:31] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: i added the deeplinking to the demos today
[17:25:37] <arschmitz> so you can use it now
[17:26:42] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: mobile safari iOS 6
[17:26:56] <toddmparker___> lemme restart my phone
[17:26:57] <uGoMobi> yes
[17:27:29] <toddmparker___> could just be freaking out
[17:27:49] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: saw you added that demo for deep linking - great
[17:28:09] <toddmparker___> so i have more time to work on docs tonight
[17:28:26] <arschmitz> awesome me too
[17:28:29] <toddmparker___> i could either start adding more widget pages like button
[17:28:40] <arschmitz> im finishing up a demo on using the deeplinking right now
[17:28:49] <toddmparker___> or we could work on the overall formatting and IA for the sections
[17:29:08] <arschmitz> overall might be good so we can really git things going
[17:29:24] <arschmitz> git ha ha ha 
[17:29:41] <toddmparker___> heh
[17:29:46] <toddmparker___> i was thinking that too
[17:30:11] <toddmparker___> so one thing we need to figure out is how to centralize the panel content across pages
[17:30:18] <toddmparker___> like an include
[17:30:28] <toddmparker___> one option would be use https://github.com/filamentgroup/Ajax-Include-Pattern/
[17:30:50] <toddmparker___> and just tack on the bit to enhance the widgets within
[17:31:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: what exactly do you mean panel content?
[17:31:27] <arschmitz> are we going to use a panel as a menu for the demos
[17:31:27] <toddmparker___> sorry
[17:31:45] <toddmparker___> thinking it would be nice to use panels for local nav
[17:31:53] <uGoMobi> I agree
[17:32:01] <arschmitz> yeah i think that makes sense just had not heard it before lol
[17:32:07] <toddmparker___> so if i dig into widgets, i could open a panel to nav between other widgets
[17:32:13] <toddmparker___> ah, ok
[17:32:31] <arschmitz> yeah i like that idea
[17:33:21] <arschmitz> i think panels can be great for nav
[17:33:26] <uGoMobi> it would be really nice if we would only have to maintain the content menu at one place
[17:34:13] <toddmparker___> exactly
[17:34:21] <toddmparker___> what we do now in the docs is insane
[17:34:40] <toddmparker___> so how to centralize these nav lists and set an on state
[17:35:15] <uGoMobi> we could use PHP because you need that anyway to be able to browse the docs local
[17:35:16] <arschmitz> a php include might be the easiest
[17:35:20] <arschmitz> lol
[17:35:21] <uGoMobi> :)
[17:35:29] <uGoMobi> great minds....
[17:36:33] <toddmparker___> so when we package the docs locally, they still work, but don't have the ajax nav
[17:36:44] <toddmparker___> so what happens when we package?
[17:37:19] <toddmparker___> could we somehow publish the pages for the zip with the includes baked in?
[17:37:37] <arschmitz> pho is required for the docs no matter what so it does not matter
[17:37:42] <toddmparker___> btw - i agree about includes, feel lost without 'em
[17:37:44] <arschmitz> php
[17:39:00] <toddmparker___> that mean these would all need to be .php pages
[17:39:19] <arschmitz> yeah
[17:39:45] <toddmparker___> hmm
[17:39:49] <arschmitz> or use htaccess to parse php in html but thats just an extension at that point
[17:39:54] <uGoMobi> I am googling "save php output to html"
[17:40:20] <toddmparker___> i'd like to think about other options just to make sure our bases are covered
[17:41:17] <uGoMobi> iframe is an option we should not want to consider
[17:41:27] <uGoMobi> if you ask me
[17:41:58] <arschmitz> you could use an oldschool serverside include
[17:42:10] <arschmitz> <!--#include virtual="insertthisfile.html" -->
[17:44:03] <arschmitz> since eliminates php
[17:44:19] <toddmparker___> SSI
[17:44:31] <toddmparker___> yeah, same deal as PHP 
[17:45:12] <arschmitz> yes but you need a server for docs no matter what and it makes it so we can keep everything html instead of php
[17:45:59] <toddmparker___> client side include of some format? stuff the content into localStorage
[17:46:11] <toddmparker___> i dunno, just spitballing
[17:48:09] <uGoMobi> downside of client side is that isn't SEO friendly
[17:48:26] <arschmitz> very true php is at least
[17:48:35] <uGoMobi> yup
[17:49:10] <toddmparker___> oh, i agree with that for sure
[17:49:15] <toddmparker___> not very PE
[17:49:24] <uGoMobi> yes also
[17:49:57] <toddmparker___> i was thinking we could have a panel that just had a link to the widget listing page. we're append the list of links after that.
[17:50:12] <toddmparker___> so there would be a functional link
[17:50:48] <toddmparker___> guess we need to think about how to do a better job on this kind of thing. common problem. not sure there is an easy solution tho.
[17:52:19] <uGoMobi> I am thinking what we could do with an XML sitemap
[17:53:19] <uGoMobi> why do we make the documentation available offline?
[17:54:15] <arschmitz> its like a sample site
[17:54:28] <arschmitz> allows people a premade site to play with
[17:54:39] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[17:55:09] <toddmparker___> if you have access to the .htaccess file on your server, you can add a simple directive that will allow php to be interpreted on files ending in .html extension.
[17:55:09] <toddmparker___> RemoveHandler .html
[17:55:09] <toddmparker___> AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .html
[17:55:37] <toddmparker___> if we can keep the file extension html, that would be nice
[17:55:37] <arschmitz> lol toddmparker___ i already suggested that
[17:55:53] <toddmparker___> oh, sorry i missed that!
[17:55:59] <uGoMobi> does that depend on which modules are installed?
[17:56:08] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: the why is a decent question
[17:56:13] <toddmparker___> because UI does it?
[17:56:17] <arschmitz> .htaccess can be per directory too so we can just toss one in root that does it
[17:56:50] <toddmparker___> cool
[17:57:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: i think the offline access and download of the docs is a great sample site for people that are new to play and expirament with
[17:57:27] <toddmparker___> that is true for sure
[17:57:38] <arschmitz> they can open and examine the markup and make changes and see results etc
[17:57:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: but we could still offer a simple downloadable demo site
[17:57:48] <toddmparker___> i think UI has been able to keep their pages very simple, just html
[17:58:01] <toddmparker___> because they display them via iframes
[17:58:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes but that yet anohter thing to maintain
[17:58:11] <toddmparker___> that is not a choice fo rus
[17:58:42] <arschmitz> personally i think how we do it now is good
[17:58:57] <arschmitz> but add in the php include for nav
[17:59:19] <arschmitz> and something like the php include nav is a very real world situation 
[17:59:30] <arschmitz> its like a demo in itself lol
[17:59:36] <toddmparker___> true
[17:59:59] <arschmitz> iv done an include liek this for header and nav etc on several jqm sites 
[18:00:14] <toddmparker___> cool
[18:00:29] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: i share your concern but there is value
[18:00:35] <arschmitz> i think most people using JQM for sites requiring a server side language are doing this already
[18:00:38] <uGoMobi> I use php too
[18:00:50] <toddmparker___> yeah
[18:00:57] <uGoMobi> easy solution here
[18:01:21] <toddmparker___> so we could just start with a simple link back to the parent page in the markup
[18:01:39] <toddmparker___> then include the panel if php is supported
[18:01:53] <arschmitz> yeah good idea
[18:02:06] <toddmparker___> maybe script it so we replace the simple link with the button to open the panel if present
[18:02:11] <arschmitz> toddmparker: but docs wont work without php anyway
[18:02:17] <arschmitz> we use it to assemble the js
[18:02:23] <toddmparker___> so it works in a simpler way downloaded 
[18:02:50] <toddmparker___> no, the zip works if you just double click a html page
[18:03:06] <uGoMobi> do they?
[18:03:19] <toddmparker___> downloading now
[18:03:24] <uGoMobi> I thought the same as arschmitz 
[18:03:31] <toddmparker___> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.3.0-beta.1/jquery.mobile-1.3.0-beta.1.zip
[18:03:34] <uGoMobi> the JS is combined by PHP
[18:04:26] <toddmparker___> yeah, works great
[18:04:43] <toddmparker___> every link is non-ajax but otherwise, works perfectly
[18:05:09] <arschmitz> do demos work?
[18:05:16] <toddmparker___> we package a bunch of css and js files as part of the build
[18:05:19] <arschmitz> demos use php to combine some stuff
[18:05:23] <toddmparker___> the pages then link to those static concat files
[18:05:31] <arschmitz> that i dont think we updated in build
[18:05:35] <toddmparker___> yep, demos are fine
[18:05:52] <arschmitz> with source view? cool _|Nix|_ must have fixed that
[18:06:00] <toddmparker___> except for the few that directly use php like the form submit example
[18:06:37] <arschmitz> cool
[18:06:40] <toddmparker___> so maybe we can do the same. use php includes but when we build the zip, actually bake that into each page
[18:06:44] <uGoMobi> ok nice
[18:06:57] <arschmitz> then yeah toss a static link in for if php is missing
[18:07:00] <toddmparker___> check out the zip if you haven't already. works well
[18:07:05] <uGoMobi> yeah have to see how we do this with the JS
[18:07:06] <toddmparker___> right
[18:07:21] <arschmitz> and include nav with php and call it a day lol
[18:07:36] <arschmitz> just like toddmparker___ said
[18:07:44] <toddmparker___> ok, so this seems like a workable approach.
[18:08:04] <toddmparker___> do we need php or just SSI?
[18:08:04] <arschmitz> maybe when gseguin is around we can ask him about auto concanting this stuff like we do for js
[18:08:13] <toddmparker___> guess we already use php
[18:08:17] <arschmitz> php for SEO
[18:08:29] <toddmparker___> johnbender maintains that build script
[18:08:40] <uGoMobi> interestinggg
[18:08:57] <uGoMobi> ok so we have a plan
[18:09:39] <toddmparker___> yep, seems so
[18:10:02] <toddmparker___> let's set up that include pattern in the docs
[18:10:03] <arschmitz> well we can ask johnbender about build then lol 
[18:10:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker___ cool 
[18:10:22] <toddmparker___> we'll figure out how to "publish" static page if possible
[18:10:28] <arschmitz> yup
[18:10:40] <toddmparker___> can we keep with .html for now too?
[18:10:55] <arschmitz> yeah just add an .htaccess in root
[18:11:00] <toddmparker___> nice
[18:11:02] <arschmitz> to parse php in html
[18:11:11] <toddmparker___> ok, that is square
[18:11:14] <arschmitz> i can take care of that if you want
[18:11:24] <toddmparker___> thanks arschmitz 
[18:11:34] <toddmparker___> next, we need to decide on the overall IA buckets
[18:11:52] <toddmparker___> maybe a doc will help
[18:11:53] <toddmparker___> http://oksoclap.com/5TwqrhhMTZ
[18:14:21] <toddmparker___> think these are the 4 major buckets we've discussed
[18:14:37] <arschmitz> yup
[18:15:50] <uGoMobi> theming, RWD
[18:15:59] <uGoMobi> just shooting
[18:16:24] <toddmparker___> thanks, added that
[18:17:26] <toddmparker___> for the "widgets" section (better name needed), we will definitely have cases where multiple pages are needed
[18:17:42] <toddmparker___> like listviews have too many features
[18:17:52] <toddmparker___> so we need a nice solution for that
[18:18:35] <toddmparker___> one option: use the left panel as drilldown
[18:19:10] <toddmparker___> top level > drill to second level (list of all widgets) > third level (list of pages within widget X)
[18:19:37] <arschmitz> a collapsible is another option
[18:19:42] <toddmparker___> true
[18:19:49] <uGoMobi> thats what we use now
[18:20:06] <toddmparker___> one consideration is how big the IA will eventually be
[18:20:30] <toddmparker___> for example, we have ~30 widget pages
[18:20:42] <arschmitz> true
[18:20:44] <toddmparker___> will quickly have 30-50 demos
[18:21:03] <toddmparker___> and for the Q&A, is each Q a node in the menu?
[18:21:04] <arschmitz> we could group them further
[18:21:15] <toddmparker___> or is that always just a page
[18:21:26] <arschmitz> each question is a page
[18:22:03] <toddmparker___> right. but should each Q be listed in the panel or will that be too long/wordy?
[18:22:20] <arschmitz> for widgets we could do like top level content widget / form widget / etc then second level individual widgets
[18:22:25] <arschmitz> i think that will be too much
[18:22:41] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: i agree re: it being too long
[18:22:58] <arschmitz> i think maybe for faq we dont do nav panel or maybe do something with remote auto complete for search in the panel ?
[18:22:59] <uGoMobi> I think for FAQ and demos we shouldn't list them all in the nav menu
[18:23:14] <toddmparker___> i wanted a flatter widget list becase the current categories seem to get in the way
[18:23:39] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: that might make sense because both might need longer names or even a name + description
[18:23:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker___ yeah that true was just throwing out options
[18:23:47] <uGoMobi> yes
[18:23:49] <toddmparker___> same with guides
[18:24:30] <arschmitz> yeah im all for no nav on faq
[18:24:38] <uGoMobi> but for widget/components it would be nice if we have them all in the nav menu with an accordion or something
[18:24:50] <arschmitz> yup
[18:25:08] <uGoMobi> for FAQ we can make an index page with categories
[18:25:27] <uGoMobi> and each category its own page with a collapsible set
[18:25:28] <toddmparker___> so we could start with...
[18:25:31] <toddmparker___> Home
[18:25:31] <toddmparker___> Guides
[18:25:31] <toddmparker___> Demos
[18:25:31] <toddmparker___> Q&A
[18:25:31] <toddmparker___> Widgets
[18:25:31] <toddmparker___> Accordion
[18:25:32] <toddmparker___> Autocomplete
[18:25:32] <toddmparker___> etc.
[18:25:35] <arschmitz> for faq i was thinking a list with a search filter would be good
[18:25:42] <uGoMobi> Q in the header and A in the collapsible content?
[18:25:49] <toddmparker___> woah, bad formatting. http://oksoclap.com/5TwqrhhMTZ
[18:26:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no just queston in the list and link to page for answer
[18:26:21] <uGoMobi> search filter would be nice too
[18:26:27] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[18:26:48] <uGoMobi> was just thinking what common FAQ pages look like
[18:27:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi i have a link just a sec
[18:27:11] <uGoMobi> ok
[18:27:13] <toddmparker___> oh, arschmitz has a link
[18:27:47] <arschmitz> its ugly right now but here you go http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/faq/docs/demos/faq/
[18:27:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I couldn't open the link you sent me earlier today
[18:28:01] <arschmitz> only the first link work on that list
[18:28:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: sorry must have miss typed it
[18:28:29] <uGoMobi> can't open this one either
[18:28:39] <toddmparker___> maybe for the guides, demos and Q&A - we use a tagging system so we can flag what widgets/features it applies to so you can either search or click on a tag link to winnow to all that use "collapsibles"
[18:28:48] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: can you open it its working for me
[18:28:51] <uGoMobi> :ERR_TIMED_OUT
[18:29:04] <toddmparker___> waiting...
[18:29:07] <arschmitz> oh yikes looks like my server is down
[18:29:14] <toddmparker___> hacked
[18:29:19] <arschmitz> its not working for me now either lol
[18:29:40] <toddmparker___> brb
[18:31:46] <johnbender> arschmitz: toddmparker___: uGoMobi: gseguin|away has been working on the build too so you can ask him
[18:32:00] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok thanks
[18:33:05] <toddmparker___> hey johnbender 
[18:33:35] <toddmparker___> we were just talking about the new demos and how to use php includes to centralize the nav links
[18:34:17] <toddmparker___> be nice to be able to bake the include content into the pages when we build the zip so the nav links show up w/o php
[18:36:34] <uGoMobi> ok, I have to get some sleep
[18:36:43] <uGoMobi> will catch up tomorrow
[18:36:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: goodnight
[18:36:58] <uGoMobi> goodnight guys
[18:38:08] <toddmparker___> good night uGoMobi 
[18:38:21] <toddmparker___> thanks for your help
[18:44:39] <arschmitz> toddmparker___ few rebooted server and all good now ha ha
[18:44:45] <arschmitz> had me paniced for a minute
[18:45:41] <arschmitz> have to review my logs later to see what happened lol
[18:45:58] <toddmparker___> what happened?
[18:46:13] <arschmitz> not sure i rebooted and it came back fine
[18:46:29] <arschmitz> ill look into it more later
[18:49:26] <arschmitz> so for FAQ you like the basic concept of how it is now you said right? with the filtered list that goes to individual pages?
[18:50:56] <arschmitz> http://uglymongrel.com/jqm/faq/docs/demos/faq/
[19:08:05] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: yes
[19:08:09] <toddmparker___> think that will work well
[19:10:31] <arschmitz> cool
[19:11:07] <arschmitz> i thouhgt it was a very user friendly way to do it
[19:22:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: one thing we didnt talk about is the very front page
[19:26:38] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: yeah, that one I dunno yet
[19:36:32] <arschmitz> be nice to come up with something nice
[19:37:13] <arschmitz> a bit slicker looking
[19:37:31] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: though i think your font change will make a big overall difference already
[20:01:51] <gseguin> arschmitz: ping
[20:16:03] <arschmitz> hey gseguin
[20:42:08] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: did the crazy addressbar issue go away after you rebooted your phone?
[20:55:06] <toddmparker___> lemme check
[20:55:29] <toddmparker___> yep
[20:55:35] <toddmparker___> sorry for the false alarm
[20:55:51] <toddmparker___> working on a new listview widget page
[20:56:56] <arschmitz> nice
[20:57:02] <arschmitz> good on both counts lol
[20:57:08] <arschmitz> list view is a huge section

[21:28:02] <toddmparker___> just finished roughing it out
[21:28:07] <toddmparker___> one epic page arschmitz 
[21:29:06] <toddmparker___> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/listviews/
[21:30:14] <toddmparker___> css is very hack-y but better than a picture
[21:30:43] <toddmparker___> button and listview are cross-linked
[21:34:09] <toddmparker___> i collected docs and demos from a ton of places
[21:34:38] <toddmparker___> think this is the best way to show off all the variations, one place with minimal text
[21:39:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: cool checking it out now
[21:40:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: looks good i like that a lot simple and keeps it short but pulls together all the default configs

[21:44:19] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: thanks
[21:44:40] <toddmparker___> it's amazing how many different pages I needed to cull info from for that
[21:44:49] <arschmitz> im pushing my deeplinking demo in like 2 minutes
[21:44:59] <arschmitz> yeah listviews are major
[21:45:01] <toddmparker___> this barely touches on theming
[21:45:20] <arschmitz> i personally love our listviews though great formating for so many different things
[21:45:26] <toddmparker___> but i want to think about theming a bit more anyway. i mention the data attrs for things anyway
[21:45:38] <toddmparker___> yeah, they do look pretty damn good

[21:47:37] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/deeplink/index.html#top
[21:47:51] <arschmitz> opps dont need the #top on that lol
[21:47:54] <arschmitz> shouldnt matter though
[21:48:26] <toddmparker___> niiiiice
[21:48:45] <arschmitz> its the older slider docs lol but i thought it was really good example usage
[21:48:55] <arschmitz> and i put a big warning not to refrence it lol
[21:49:16] <toddmparker___> that will be really useful
[21:49:31] <arschmitz> i was able to get rid of the widget for it completely
[21:49:32] <toddmparker___> i will add it to these long pages
[21:49:51] <arschmitz> i realized if you just set data-ajax="false" on a link it works like normal to scroll!
[21:50:27] <arschmitz> so i only needed to add an event binding for when its a link to an id on another page
[21:50:56] <toddmparker___> nice
[21:51:01] <arschmitz> so for same page stuff we could have been doing this all along by just using data-ajax-"false" lol
[21:51:11] <toddmparker___> so we could have been using this for internal links
[21:51:17] <arschmitz> yup
[21:51:55] <arschmitz> makes you feel a little foolish huh i know id did me lol
[21:52:46] <toddmparker___> it's obvious when you think of it
[21:52:52] <arschmitz> yup
[21:53:04] <arschmitz> that way it even tracks it in history like it normally would
[21:53:22] <arschmitz> 100% native
[21:54:18] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: we have really been jaming on the demos this weekend its great
[21:55:56] <toddmparker___> yeah, i feel like there is a plan now
[21:56:03] <toddmparker___> more of less
[21:56:13] <toddmparker___> think this will come together pretty fast now
[21:56:39] <toddmparker___> ok, i need to hit the hay
[21:56:43] <toddmparker___> goodnight!
[21:56:53] <arschmitz> ok im commiting the .htaccess right now and heading out too
