[02:13:28] <duderion> hi guys
[02:14:22] <duderion> i have a problem with iphone swipe and bouncing ;/
[02:14:44] <duderion> i made a html5 webpage for iphone
[02:15:00] <duderion> i wanted the page to scroll to the next page on swipeUp
[02:15:54] <duderion> but the page 'bounces' after it has reached the scrollTop() position
[02:16:45] <duderion> i did on(touchstart):e.preventDefault()
[02:16:52] <duderion> but that removes scrolling completely
[02:17:09] <duderion> the swiping works, the page doesnt bounce anymore
[02:17:23] <duderion> but there is no scrolling available afterwards
[02:17:25] <duderion> :(((((
[02:59:47] <uGoMobi> duderion: this is the dev team channel, #jquery is the channel for support (also for JQM)
[03:00:03] <duderion> ok
[03:00:08] <duderion> sorry ;/

[07:39:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i just push my panel refactor to a branch 
[07:39:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: and goodmorning / evening 
[07:39:47] <uGoMobi> afternoon :)
[07:39:47] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:39:49] <uGoMobi> hey arschmitz 
[07:40:12] <uGoMobi> ok, will give panels a look soon
[07:40:17] <arschmitz> yeah its what 4 there?
[07:40:28] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no rush there is nothing holding me up or anything
[07:40:31] <uGoMobi> yeah 4.40pm
[07:40:35] <arschmitz> i just wanted to let you know
[07:40:50] <uGoMobi> and I am curious what it looks like :)
[07:41:10] <arschmitz> yeah aside from some css tweaks i think its looking pretty good
[07:41:31] <arschmitz> i got all the basic functionality restored and working when navigating between pages
[07:42:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i took an absolutely hilarious test yesterday
[07:42:39] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what did you do?
[07:42:45] <arschmitz> this big international retailer has been trying to get me to do some work for them and they wanted me to take a "tech assesment"
[07:42:58] <arschmitz> and one of the questions was what is jQuery
[07:43:00] <arschmitz> lol
[07:43:05] <uGoMobi> hahaha
[07:43:44] <arschmitz> another one was what is the proper function to use with jquery to wait until the document is loaded before executiing a script
[07:44:00] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:44:38] <arschmitz> yeah i was like seriously you are trying to get me here and it seems like you didnt even look at my resume or what i do?
[07:45:01] <uGoMobi> did you tell them afterwards?
[07:45:06] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:46:52] <arschmitz> i just thought it was funny
[07:47:05] <uGoMobi> it sure is
[07:47:10] <uGoMobi> tricky thing is...
[07:47:47] <uGoMobi> because you might not read carefully you might make a mistake in the answer
[07:47:59] <arschmitz> lol yeah 
[07:48:15] <uGoMobi> like.... duh ... $( document ).on( "pageinit" , function() { ...
[07:48:17] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:48:32] <arschmitz> im not really too worried they are trying to recruit me i didnt go to them
[07:48:42] <arschmitz> im not even sure i would take it 
[07:48:48] <uGoMobi> ok
[07:49:26] <arschmitz> but i figured give them a chance and see what they offer their headquarters is only a 15 minute drive from my house
[07:50:25] <uGoMobi> yes of course, you can always say no later
[07:50:32] <arschmitz> yup
[07:51:57] <arschmitz> there is going to be a lot to talk about at the meeting today lol
[07:52:08] <arschmitz> two weeks and there has been a lot of work going on
[07:52:48] <arschmitz> between you, johnbender, and i its been crazy lately
[07:53:54] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we need to figure out the next step with tabs
[07:54:10] <uGoMobi> right
[07:54:23] <arschmitz> do we just merge into master or do we want to keep in a branch for now and considder if any default css is needed
[07:55:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: when there are unit tests we can merge into master I think
[07:55:52] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: then we can create a page for the demo center
[07:56:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is already demo pages
[07:56:07] <uGoMobi> add some examples
[07:56:15] <uGoMobi> ah ok, create
[07:56:25] <uGoMobi> great*
[07:56:27] <uGoMobi> lol
[07:56:48] <arschmitz> and i think the only test he need is to make sure it inits because all ofther tests are ui
[07:57:01] <uGoMobi> was thinking that when you work on examples you will find out if we need more default styling
[07:57:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: http://view.jquerymobile.com/tabs/demos/widgets/tabs/
[07:58:30] <johnbender>  uGoMobi: thats now $( document ).on( "pagecreate" ... ); :)
[07:58:37] <johnbender> pageinit is deprecated
[07:58:53] <uGoMobi> johnbender: haha
[07:58:54] <arschmitz> johnbender: ha ha
[07:59:47] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: looks good
[08:00:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: can you add "view source"
[08:00:34] <arschmitz> oh yeah forgot all about that
[08:00:36] <arschmitz> of course
[08:01:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think the navbar and inset listview give perfect style options
[08:01:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I was thinking of a data-content-theme like we use for collapsibles
[08:02:13] <arschmitz> that would have to be added as an extension but should be very simple to do
[08:02:37] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: have to see if it's worth it thought
[08:02:58] <uGoMobi> pretty easy to add body theme class to markup
[08:03:31] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: this is the entire mobile portion of the widget right now https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/tabs/js/widgets/tabs.js
[08:03:52] <arschmitz> and the whole uuid function will go away once we pull in the ui core
[08:04:16] <uGoMobi> cool
[08:04:51] <arschmitz> basicly just add on the mobile base widget stuff and add autoinit
[08:06:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: one advantage to not putting a content theme is you can do different themes on each tab
[08:06:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: true
[08:07:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i do have to look at one aria related thing though
[08:07:12] <uGoMobi> looks like we shouldn't do any theming
[08:07:27] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: you can ask Victor to help with ARIA
[08:07:35] <uGoMobi> or review
[08:07:42] <arschmitz> victor though that when the navbar and tabs are together they are conflicting and overwriting each other
[08:08:03] <arschmitz> Victor already reviewed it he thought it looked perfect just had that one comment i need to look into
[08:08:08] <uGoMobi> ah ok nice
[08:09:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i kinda like it left completely bare and then tack on other widgets / classes to theme it how you want
[08:09:16] <arschmitz> makes it super flexible
[08:09:56] <arschmitz> very intresting possibilities with that it works to pull in tab content with ajax too
[08:10:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: in the first example with the navbar when you click on the 3rd tab you see a float issue or something
[08:10:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so we might want to add a few basic things
[08:10:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i noticed that i just have not tried to fix it yet
[08:10:23] <uGoMobi> like navbar + tabs = clear both
[08:10:31] <uGoMobi> yes understand
[08:10:42] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i think thats more about the demos then general usage though im not sure need to look closer
[08:10:50] <uGoMobi> just an example of CSS that might be useful
[08:11:04] <uGoMobi> but I agree we should keep it simple
[08:11:05] <arschmitz> yeah maybe just a few rules to clean things up by default
[08:11:18] <arschmitz> i bet we could use the classes that are already there though
[08:11:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I didn't really looked what caused that
[08:11:32] <arschmitz> just make some rules for the combos
[08:11:40] <uGoMobi> yes
[08:11:46] <uGoMobi> that might be useful
[08:12:05] <arschmitz> thinking myabe leave in a branch for now 
[08:12:06] <uGoMobi> but other than that I don't think we need to add any style
[08:12:22] <arschmitz> and once your done with next maybe we can take a day or two and clean it up together
[08:12:40] <arschmitz> figure out what if any default rules or extensions we want to do 
[08:12:54] <uGoMobi> ok sounds good
[08:13:19] <arschmitz> i think we are on the same page that super minimal is the way to go though
[08:13:30] <uGoMobi> I mostly find out about useful things to add when I create demos 
[08:13:43] <uGoMobi> yes for sure
[08:13:54] <arschmitz> the demo page can use a little tweaking too
[08:14:01] <arschmitz> and maybe some more examples
[08:14:30] <arschmitz> damn all this work makes me so excited for 1.4
[08:14:49] <arschmitz> i have some sites im just itching to upgrade lol
[08:15:28] <uGoMobi> haha
[08:16:22] <uGoMobi> yeah I am really excited about it too... that heavy markup was hurting my eyes everytime I was inspecting the code
[08:16:50] <arschmitz> lol yeah
[08:16:59] <uGoMobi> although I understand that in 2010 things were different
[08:17:05] <arschmitz> for sure
[08:18:08] <arschmitz> things change fast
[08:18:35] <arschmitz> i mean most of the stuff in the library was originally written prior to firefox 4
[08:18:44] <arschmitz> so pre css3 even in firefox
[08:21:32] <uGoMobi> yes, whole different ball game

[12:36:42] <mspisars> flex
[12:47:25] <arschmitz> agcolom: yes its on github
[12:47:43] <arschmitz> its in a branch ext-panels
[12:48:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you still here?
[13:00:07] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I notice that $( "#page" ).page( "option", "theme", "x" ); doesn't work
[13:00:07] <toddmparker> nice to catch up
[13:00:18] <uGoMobi> should we use _setOptions there?
[13:00:33] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: on master
[13:00:34] <arschmitz> ?
[13:00:48] <uGoMobi> on next, but that is same as master
[13:00:58] <arschmitz> let me look that seems like it should work
[13:01:04] <uGoMobi> should it work?
[13:01:17] <arschmitz> pretty sure
[13:01:23] <uGoMobi> ok, then maybe I made a mistake
[13:01:40] <arschmitz> well should as in if it does not i need to make it lol
[13:02:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: doh thats my fault
[13:02:56] <arschmitz> somehow the _setOptions method is completely missing from page i swear i added it but nope so yeah gota fix that
[13:03:08] <uGoMobi> haha np
[13:03:25] <arschmitz> so for next "Assume" it works lol and ill fix on master and you can merge it in
[13:04:10] <uGoMobi> I only wanted to add it to my test page so I can use one page to test multiple themes
[13:04:27] <arschmitz> yeah ill get that fixed
[13:04:30] <agcolom> arschmitz: ok, I'll check, thanks. It's because I've spotted a typo :-)
[13:04:34] <uGoMobi> no rush
[13:04:47] <arschmitz> agcolom: oh yeah thats not a published page yet
[13:04:54] <arschmitz> i just threw it together this morning 
[13:04:59] <arschmitz> but feel free to fix lol
[13:05:12] <agcolom> ok, what is the best way to do it?
[13:05:22] <uGoMobi> commit :)
[13:05:47] <uGoMobi> sorry, not very helpful
[13:05:51] <agcolom> toddmparker: sorry had to disappear... people we hungry!
[13:06:01] <arschmitz> yeah need to clone the branch and make the changes and commit and push then
[13:06:15] <agcolom> Yes, I'll ask scott_gonzalez how to do that. 
[13:06:17] <arschmitz> or if its something really really simple you could just use the github editor i suppose
[13:06:18] <toddmparker> agcolom: i understand
[13:06:37] <toddmparker> agcolom: thanks, i'm feeling like i
[13:06:56] <toddmparker> i'm so far behind on site stuff, a cry for help!
[13:07:15] <agcolom> I thought Ralph was helping?
[13:07:22] <agcolom> (site)
[13:07:31] <agcolom> arschmitz: great, will do that. 
[13:07:36] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/ext-panels/demos/widgets/panels/external.php
[13:07:59] <arschmitz> just click edit you can make changes and at the bottom add your commit message
[13:08:10] <arschmitz> wouldnt do it for much more then a typo though :)
[13:08:35] <_|Nix|_> Hey! Sorry I bailed out of the meeting suddenly! My daughter has an allergy and I got a skype call from my wife.
[13:08:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: aii sorry to hear that
[13:08:55] <uGoMobi> she ok?
[13:08:56] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hey no problem wouldnt expect any different 
[13:08:58] <arschmitz> is she ok?
[13:09:11] <agcolom> arschmitz: yes, that's great! Thanks. Yes, just for a typo :-) 
[13:09:45] <agcolom> toddmparker: Yes, I'm happy to help :-) 
[13:10:16] <agcolom> When you say we need to move the google docs stuff, is that the meeting notes?
[13:11:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, it's weird, because it's not a food allergy either. The doctor said that some infection must've gone down silently within her resulting in a subsequent allergy, or (worse), an infection is about to rear its ugly head :/
[13:12:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: But, aside from a rash, she's happy and healthy and eating/drinking well. So, nothing bad in that sense.
[13:12:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: oh no hope everything turns out to be nothing 
[13:13:16] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: i commented on that issue
[13:13:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm actually hoping she might've gotten and then fought off mononucleosis. The younger you get it the more harmless it is, and when I got it (at 29) it was a three-week-long ordeal, and I had the same rash for the last week of it.
[13:14:03] <arschmitz> iv seen that same thing on a bunch od different scenerios on ios and its basicly double tap to zoom
[13:14:24] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah iv never had that but iv always heard that kinda like chicken pox
[13:14:31] <arschmitz> much much worse the older you get
[13:14:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: For young kids, OTOH, it's usually indistinguishable from a cold.
[13:14:36] <agcolom> arschmitz: I need to check one sentence with you
[13:14:48] <arschmitz> agcolom: ok shoot
[13:14:53] <agcolom> >Navigate to page to below to see this behivor. This page has no panels in it
[13:14:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, you don't wanna get that as an adult ...
[13:15:44] <agcolom> I think you mean ">Navigate to page 2 below to see this behavior. This page has no panels." (I think the in it is not necessary... Is that ok?)
[13:15:56] <arschmitz> agcolom: yup
[13:16:04] <agcolom> Or this page doesn't contain any panel
[13:16:11] <_|Nix|_> Anyway, I'm'na go squeeze in some lunch before the talks start. L8R all!
[13:16:18] <arschmitz> agcolom: either way 
[13:16:22] <agcolom> L8R _|Nix|_ !
[13:16:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: take care have fun
[13:17:15] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: What do you need?
[13:17:26] <agcolom> ok, general view, what's better? "This page has no panel." or "This page doesn't contain a panel"
[13:17:51] <arschmitz> i like doesn't contain
[13:18:01] <arschmitz> but should be plural

[13:18:19] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: toddmparker asked me to see with you how we need to setup what we need to move from the google docs
[13:18:25] <toddmparker> hi scott_gonzalez - i asked agcolom to help me out by porting all the old meeting notes from google docs to the new github system
[13:18:37] <agcolom> arschmitz: ok, great! Thanks. Will make that chande
[13:18:37] <toddmparker> can you get her up to speed on the process?
[13:18:41] <agcolom> change!^
[13:19:04] <agcolom> ...
[13:19:12] <agcolom> Am I disconnected?
[13:19:13] <scott_gonzalez> agcolom: Oh, so there's no automated process for this.
[13:20:05] <agcolom> ok, so copy/paste?
[13:20:08] <scott_gonzalez> It's an easy thing to do though, just time consuming.
[13:20:19] <agcolom> I'm fine with that :-)
[13:20:39] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/meetings.jquery.org is just a collection of markdown files.
[13:20:54] <scott_gonzalez> So you'll just create files in https://github.com/jquery/meetings.jquery.org/tree/master/minutes/mobile
[13:21:01] <scott_gonzalez> With the date of the meeting as the name of the file.
[13:21:35] <agcolom> great. Seems easy enough :-)
[13:21:49] <scott_gonzalez> You might be able to save the Google doc as an HTML file, then run that through an html to markdown converter.
[13:21:57] <scott_gonzalez> Not sure how clean the result would be.
[13:22:13] <scott_gonzalez> But it might do most of the work for you, then you'd just need to do some cleanup and split it into separate files.
[13:22:18] <scott_gonzalez> I just did the UI ones manually.
[13:22:33] <agcolom> That's what I was going to ask :-)
[13:22:40] <scott_gonzalez> I just copy/pasted and then did all the formatting manually.
[13:22:51] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's mostly just lists and links, there's not too much formatting to do.
[13:22:57] <agcolom> Exactly! 
[13:23:09] <scott_gonzalez> It took me a few hours, but it's certainly not hard work :-)
[13:23:20] <agcolom> I like to feel in control :-) If I edit it myself, I know what is going on :-)
[13:23:27] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[13:24:12] <agcolom> Cool! toddmparker where are all the google docs?
[13:25:10] <agcolom> My internet seems REALLY slow, so the irc client takes a while to put my messages up!
[13:26:51] <agcolom> Cool! toddmparker where are all the google docs? (sorry My internet is REALLY slow today and the irc client takes forever to put my messages up!)
[13:27:53] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: toddmparker I should be able to do this either tomorrow evening and/or saturday
[13:28:13] <toddmparker> agcolom - i'll share the whole folder with you
[13:30:54] <toddmparker> agcolom: I just shared a huge folder of meeting notes
[13:31:08] <toddmparker> scott_gonzalez: how far back do we need to port these notes?
[13:31:19] <scott_gonzalez> all of them
[13:31:47] <agcolom> toddmparker: ok, will check now...
[13:32:12] <toddmparker> I have docs back to may 2011
[13:32:38] <toddmparker> so the files we had up on the updates.jquery.org site weren't moved over?
[13:33:05] <toddmparker> agcolom: seems like a good task for extra credit for your students :)
[13:38:08] <agcolom> toddmparker: yes, that's tempting ;-)
[13:40:34] <agcolom> toddmparker: although I'm in desperate need of a good few hours of copy/paste repetitive task :-)
[13:41:39] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker: Yeah, the UI notes go back that far as well.
[13:42:58] <agcolom> (to make me feel better after a few bad days at work... nothing major, just one VERY unpleasant colleague!)
[13:44:50] <agcolom> scott_gonzalez: is it best to clone the repo and do it local first? 
[13:47:57] <toddmparker> well i'm happy you like repetitive work. good to do in front of the tv
[13:48:38] <agcolom> yes :-)

[14:21:54] <agcolom> toddmparker: sorry just one question I'm just looking at today's minutes... If a member was not present (i.e. not update listed, just like Jason for today), should I remove that person from the attendance list in what I put on the new system?
