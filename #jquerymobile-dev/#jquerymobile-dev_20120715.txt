[05:17:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping!
[05:18:06] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi !
[05:18:12] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[05:18:23] <MauriceG> one question?
[05:18:27] <uGoMobi> sure
[05:19:36] <MauriceG> for example changing a split-icon programmatically,? Is it possible to refresh the view?
[05:20:12] * uGoMobi is looking at the code
[05:20:35] <MauriceG> i mean to change the the split-icon on the listview level
[05:24:08] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: you can change the split-icon programmatically and call listview("refresh")
[05:24:12] <uGoMobi> that should work
[05:24:21] <MauriceG> yes, should ...
[05:24:38] <uGoMobi> but doesn't?
[05:25:00] <MauriceG> for me not (like usual...)
[05:25:53] <MauriceG> refresh just refreshes a list item if it has not class ui-li. Like a new added item
[05:26:11] <uGoMobi> it also looks like that when you set data-icon on a list item, this would override data-split-icon set on the listview
[05:26:54] <uGoMobi> Note that the refresh() method only affects new nodes appended to a list. This is done for performance reasons. Any list items already enhanced will be ignored by the refresh process. This means that if you change the contents or attributes on an already enhanced list item, these won't be reflected. If you want a list item to be updated, replace it with fresh markup before calling refresh.
[05:26:55] <MauriceG> yes, either the list item or the second link in the item.  But setting on list level don't work.
[05:27:34] <uGoMobi> maybe that paragraph in the docs explains it
[05:28:55] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I asked johnbender about the code for setting data-icon on listview (commit 1 of your PR)
[05:29:08] <MauriceG> so, it is not possible and the new list-icon attribute on listview will also not work this way...
[05:29:14] <uGoMobi> we are in favor of more readable code using IF and setting VAR
[05:29:14] <MauriceG> yes, I saw
[05:29:34] <MauriceG> and I work on version 3
[05:29:45] <uGoMobi> shall we work on a fix for all those listview options?
[05:29:54] <uGoMobi> ah, you already are :)
[05:29:59] <uGoMobi> cool
[05:30:24] <MauriceG> but I have to use a new variable.
[05:30:32] <uGoMobi> we should do this in a consistent way for all options for the listview
[05:31:09] <uGoMobi> adding a variable is fine
[05:31:18] <MauriceG> And I have to use jqmData also ...
[05:31:19] <uGoMobi> adding new options is not ;)
[05:32:15] <uGoMobi> sounds fair because we do that already for dividerTheme and I suggested the same for data-icon
[05:34:48] <uGoMobi> I am in favor of a consistent approach for all options... setting a default in options (which can be programmatically set to something else) and then check if it's overridden by a data-attibute on the listview or on the list-item (both by using jqmData)
[05:37:55] <uGoMobi> ?tell _|Nix|_ Gabriel, can you have a look at this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4691 ? Thanks!
[05:37:56] <bot-t1> uGoMobi, Okay.
[05:37:56] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4691 on jquery-mobile (joanscript; 1d, 21h ago): pagebeforecreate bug in JQM 1.1.1?
[05:39:12] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: thanks so far.
[05:39:36] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: sure, no problem :)
[05:43:56] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: coming back to my initial question:  when forcing a listview to re-create .listview( 'refresh', true ) the layout breaks.
[05:44:37] <uGoMobi> and trigger("create")?
[05:44:46] <MauriceG> does not.
[05:45:03] <uGoMobi> what does the true parameter do BTW?
[05:46:28] <MauriceG> force a create of the list view.  refresh: function( create )
[05:47:48] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:52:15] <MauriceG> My problem is:  Setting the data-icon option for an existing listview does not update the listviews icons. It will just be used for new added items.
[05:53:14] <MauriceG> It's the same like for the split-icon option.  listview ( 'refresh' ) does not work for this.
[05:57:25] <uGoMobi> maybe because we don't use _setOption
[05:57:36] <uGoMobi> dunno, would have to look into it
[05:58:05] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: is there a need for support this ?
[06:04:58] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: at some point we want it to be able to manipulate all widget options, I suppose
[06:05:35] <uGoMobi> same goes for dynamically adding items to components, etc.
[06:09:24] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: therefor it is also better to set icon: "arrow-r" as default in the options object and not as a fallback in a IF and OR construction
[06:10:00] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: yes, already there
[06:10:10] <uGoMobi> cool
[06:12:10] <MauriceG> but, what I don't get: you said before: "adding new options is not ;)"  ... what do you mean by that?
[06:19:39] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: new options like "listIcon" instead of always using "icon"
[06:24:15] <MauriceG> ah so ...  you mean options name ...  But you made me to do so in your example code at my PR ...
[06:31:46] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I don't see any new options https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4582#issuecomment-6827170
[06:31:47] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (3w, 1d ago): New listview option icon - change or disable icons on listviews
[06:32:41] <uGoMobi> only variables
[06:40:03] <MauriceG> yes, but I took   listIcon = $list.jqmData( "icon" ) || o.icon   as a suggestion for the option name ...
[06:41:19] <uGoMobi> that's just a declaration of a variable
[06:41:34] <MauriceG> yesss ....
[06:46:24] <MauriceG> In my first PR I've used icon as option. After your code example I took, my a bit thoughtless, this variable as the option. Yes, I'm guilty. unforgivable ...
[06:53:41] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: did I say something that annoys you?
[06:55:23] <MauriceG> agcolom: no!  I'm not serious now ...
[06:55:46] <MauriceG> not a -> tab  u -> tab  uGoMobi   sorry
[06:57:10] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:   but you don't stop talking about this  linkicon option  :-)
[06:58:33] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: well, I was just answering your question
[07:00:11] <MauriceG> well, indeed. But you start with  "adding new options" ...
[07:07:18] <uGoMobi> yes true, since it sounded like you thought adding a variable is a problem I found it useful to mention
[07:07:37] <uGoMobi> anyway... it's clear now
[07:35:24] <uGoMobi> ?tell johnbender : John, when I do '$ grunt js #' on master the unminified file has an error on line 32 where there is a line-break between    version: "1.2.0-pre    and       ",
[07:35:24] <bot-t1> uGoMobi, Okay.

[13:29:50] <bot-t1> (7 hours 51 mins ago) <uGoMobi> tell _|Nix|_ Gabriel, can you have a look at this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4691 ? Thanks!
[13:29:51] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4691 on jquery-mobile (joanscript; 2d, 5h ago): pagebeforecreate bug in JQM 1.1.1?
[13:30:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah :)
[13:30:10] <uGoMobi> it works
[13:32:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: in the documentation I saw event and ui object as parameters... what's available in the ui object?
[13:33:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, that needs to be changed. These events are triggered in the most basic of ways. I don't believe there's anything in that object.
[13:34:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, thoughts so too but wasn't sure
[13:34:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: As for that bug, I think it's pretty obscure. So, we broke someone's code. Happens all the time.
[13:34:35] <uGoMobi> anyway... nice work
[13:35:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think we made any guarantees that the behaviour described there will always be that way.
[13:36:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I thought maybe you know what could have caused it
[13:36:45] <uGoMobi> since you have been done a lot with url and hash stuff
[13:37:12] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, but that person is doing a lot of redirecting ...
[13:37:20] <uGoMobi>  - been*
[13:37:30] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw that
[13:38:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks for looking at it
[13:40:16] <uGoMobi> the popup page looks good!
[13:41:47] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[13:42:13] <uGoMobi> todd pulled the fancy examples to the top
[13:42:41] <uGoMobi> starting with good examples is good
[13:45:28] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, I saw that ... I'll open the photos in FF to check out your scaling code.
[13:45:55] <_|Nix|_> Wow! Cool!
[13:46:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nicely done!
[13:46:15] <uGoMobi> thanks
[13:46:34] <_|Nix|_> Observes tolerance and everything ...
[13:47:02] <uGoMobi> well actually I hardcoded the top tolerance ;)
[13:47:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah - there's no good configuration source for that right now. I declare the tolerances inside some obscure function. Maybe that's not such a good idea.
[13:47:45] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #347: STILL UNSTABLE in 17 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/347/
[13:49:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: not sure if it's needed, because people might want to set their own tolerane anyway
[13:49:32] <uGoMobi> some want it to be % others same amount as right/left
[13:50:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: box-sizing: margin-box might be nice to have :)
[13:52:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or we could hack it by adding margins to the popup container, and then I check the margin size using .css( "margin-left" ) and use that as my tolerance. What do you think?
[13:52:21] <uGoMobi> padding-box you mean?
[13:52:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono ... I want the margins included when positioning the popup.
[13:53:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, 0, 0 for the popup is actually the top left corner of the margin.
[13:53:18] <uGoMobi> margin-box doesn't exist as far as I know
[13:53:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I know it doesn't exist - it's wishful thinking :0
[13:53:36] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:53:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: But anyway, what do you think about using margins for tolerance?
[13:53:52] <uGoMobi> ah, you just invented it :)
[13:54:09] <uGoMobi> should call it box-sizing nix-box then ;)
[13:54:13] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:55:17] <_|Nix|_> Oh, NM ... if we added margins to the popup container, we get into crazy things like margin-left: 12% or some other whacky value, and I have to figure out how many pixels that is, eh?
[13:56:32] <uGoMobi> i think jquery's css() will return px value
[13:56:55] <_|Nix|_> Really? Hmmm ... that'd be worth a test.
[13:59:51] <uGoMobi> nah, I think I am wrong
[14:00:01] <uGoMobi> how about offset?
[14:00:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I wish you were right ...
[14:00:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: .offset() is beautiful. It lets you get ***and set*** global coordinates and will get the element placed correctly!
[14:01:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I absolutely love it. You can totally ignore the DOM hierarchy and just set the global coordinates for an element.
[14:02:06] <uGoMobi> I remember getting some strange values with IE though :(
[14:02:25] <uGoMobi> but might have been a special case.. don't remember exactly
[14:02:54] <uGoMobi> probably fixed it with "zoom: 1" :)
[14:03:18] <uGoMobi> zoom 1 is like duck tape for IE
[14:03:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: "duct tape" :)
[14:04:23] <uGoMobi> haha Dutch spelling
[14:04:40] <uGoMobi> don't want to tape ducks :)
[14:05:19] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Or manufacture tape out of ducks.
[14:05:36] <uGoMobi> lol, even worse
[14:06:23] <uGoMobi> anyway... would be nice to have margins included in the position logic
[14:07:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If you can find me a way to retrieve the value of each margin in pixels, it becomes trivial.
[14:10:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: outerWidth( true ) - outerWidth (false)
[14:10:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That assumes the left margin is equal to the right margin.
[14:10:35] <uGoMobi> but then you have total margin, not for each side :(
[14:10:43] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep :(
[14:10:48] <uGoMobi> yeah
[14:11:00] <uGoMobi> I first typed and then started to think
[14:11:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I thought about that too, but I had a similar problem many years ago with a completely different toolkit, so I remembered the caveat.
[14:12:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, that's the good part of problems... you learn something from it :)
[14:13:39] <_|Nix|_> ... and if you're lucky, you remember the lesson. One of the things I find most frustrating is when I'm faced with a problem, and I remember solving it before, but I don't remember how.
[14:14:00] <_|Nix|_> That totally kills me.
[14:16:48] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: oh yeah, I totally know what you mean

[14:20:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Even if it appears to return pixel values, that may just be on your browser. We must make sure it returns pixel values on /all/ browsers.
[14:21:43] <uGoMobi> even on phantomjs? ;)
[14:23:29] <uGoMobi> but I can't imagine this being different on various browsers

[15:06:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the video example is giving an error in the console on Chrome
[15:06:23] <uGoMobi> has to do with iframe
[15:06:35] <uGoMobi> this describes it http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4324108/unsafe-javascript-attempt-to-access-frame-with-url
[15:06:59] <uGoMobi> I don't understand how I can fix it :(
[15:09:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't believe it's up to us to fix - I mean, the backtrace contains none of our code.
[15:09:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, maybe we should just pick another video as example... one that doesn't give errors
[15:10:11] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[15:13:00] <uGoMobi> phantomjs master build is on 30%
[15:23:47] <uGoMobi> whoeha! well done _|Nix|_ ... Phantom Master is steady as rock again :D
[15:24:13] <uGoMobi> two stable builds in a row!
[15:24:23] <_|Nix|_> Yeah. I see it too, but where's the fateful announcement?
[15:25:03] <uGoMobi> you mean here on IRC?
[15:25:32] <uGoMobi> Mr Jenkins only shouts when something is wrong, and at most once when we are back to normal
[15:25:51] <_|Nix|_> Well, alrighty then ...
[15:26:08] * _|Nix|_ go bed now
[15:26:13] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[15:26:24] <uGoMobi> good night _|Nix|_ !
[15:52:00] <uGoMobi> ?tell _|Nix|_ (when he is awake)... Gabriel, shouldn't we do a recalculation on resize / orientation change for the popup position?
[15:52:00] <bot-t1> uGoMobi, Okay.
