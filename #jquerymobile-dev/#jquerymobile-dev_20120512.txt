[00:19:19] <agcolom> johnbender: toddparker: just to let you know that the popups are no longer working. There were some changes 5 and 3 hours ago and I am guessing this is what caused the problem. I know it's saturday and the middle of the night for you :-) it is just so that you are aware of the problem. Is this the best mechanism to let you know of such problems? Or is email/tweeter better?
[04:36:44] <agcolom> BTW, I saw your comments in the recorded IRC so I can see what happened with the popups... Is it best I keep away from git until this is fixed? (A few doc PRs), but I'm happy to wait until tomorrow or monday....
[04:38:26] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah all the popup-related work got removed from the popup branch ...
[04:38:41] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I'm endeavouring to put it back.
[04:44:40] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Should be back now.

[05:50:19] <agcolom> Hi Gabriel, yes all ok now thank you, you are a STAR!!!!
[07:59:15] <Wilto> oh man johnbender thank god
[07:59:28] <Wilto> He said cryptically.
[15:07:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: sorry about that I reverted one of todd's commits but I must have done it improperly
[18:10:06] <toddmparker_> agcolom: that was me completely breaking everything
[18:20:58] <johnbender> Wilto: lol
[19:12:00] <Wilto> johnbender: Why, Iâ€™m certain I have no idea what you are talking about.
[19:21:01] <toddmparker_> (still hiding under my desk)
