[01:58:17] <aaronmcadam> anyone got an idea on this bug? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/parentpage-0-is-undefined
[01:58:44] <aaronmcadam> it's to do with trying to refresh a listview before the page gets shown
[01:58:57] <aaronmcadam> in my case, I'm trying to refresh content in a dialog
[02:45:38] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[02:46:01] <aaronmcadam> anyone got any ideas on dynamic listview()
[02:46:13] <aaronmcadam> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/parentpage-0-is-undefined
[07:14:36] <aaronmcadam> u guys know http://jquerymobile.com/demos/ redirects to http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0b2pre/ with a Not Found
[07:47:30] <toddparker> that demos link is bunk. i thought eddiemonge was going to fix that. it should point to the latest stable - beta 1

[10:33:22] <_nickel> toddparker: I have a quick question for Scott if he pops in
[10:33:29] <_nickel> working on the test failure
[11:40:25] <_nickel> toddparker: alright I have a working solution but I need to run it by scott
[11:40:34] <_nickel> toddparker: I'm thinking that widget needs a refactor
[11:51:17] <mrevd> hey all, is there a way for the slideup transition to push the bottom layer, like the normal slide does
