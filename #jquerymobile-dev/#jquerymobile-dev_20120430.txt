[05:12:07] <jzaefferer> johnbender: let's try again today :-)
[06:49:01] <jzaefferer> johnbender: also let's get rid of build/branch-preview and set up https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org for Mobile
[07:38:58] <jzaefferer> johnbender: I suspect I'll be out again before you're around. Was mostly looking for an update on the grunt migration.
[08:16:55] <johnbender> jzaefferer: it's rolling, today I'm beginning the move over to grunt with the bash scripts
[08:18:18] <jzaefferer> johnbender: the bash scripts? getting rid of them?
[08:20:06] <johnbender> jzaefferer: not yet
[08:20:20] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I got it migrated from the Makefile to bash scripts on friday
[08:20:28] <johnbender> and verified that the output for all the build targets is the same
[08:21:26] <johnbender> so today I'll get started with the grunt setup and just have it shell out to the bash scripts and then I can migrate them one at a time to check the output
[08:21:58] <jzaefferer> okay
[08:22:11] <jzaefferer> sounds like you didn't make use of my gruntonly branch?
[08:24:18] <jzaefferer> I still don't understand how migrating to individual bash scripts helps. If you've got a solid way to verify the output, might as well just switch to grunt directly
[08:25:21] <johnbender> 1j
[08:26:04] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I will, but I though I would wait on changing the css minification in case it monkeys with the output
[08:26:30] <johnbender> can't verify it that way
[08:27:16] <johnbender> jzaefferer: the gradual migration makes it easier to diagnose why something doesn't come out the same while making the change
[08:27:42] <johnbender> especially because if there's an issue with a minified file it can be hard to spot where the difference is
[08:28:00] <johnbender> the smaller the change the easier it is to figure out what causes issues
[08:28:15] <johnbender> s/change/changes/\
[08:29:18] <johnbender> basically the same reason you don't just rip code out and replace it during a large refactor
[08:30:05] <jzaefferer> Well, the point of my branch was to get rid of Java processes. If that isn't an issue anymore, just switch to grunt directly, but keep using the same minifiers
[08:31:01] <johnbender> jzaefferer: that's the plan but I do want to use the minification you built in there to reduce process overhead at some point
[08:31:12] <johnbender> I think we're on the verge of getting a new build server anyhow
[08:31:30] <johnbender> so it might slide down the priority list
[08:32:06] <jzaefferer> That shouldn't matter really. Getting the various jQuery projects to use the same tools, e.g. for minification, is still just as important
[08:32:37] <jzaefferer> Another example is the previously mentioned branch-preview.sh vs https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org
[08:33:04] <jzaefferer> We shouldn't be maintaining two solutions for the same issue
[08:33:18] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yah our "solution" is a 30 line bash script :D
[08:33:39] <johnbender> oops 46 lines
[08:34:37] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I agree, but it works for now and total maintenance for that has been around an hour over the last 2 months so it's not killing us
[08:34:54] <johnbender> definitely something I'm happy to do but it might be a while
[08:35:12] <jzaefferer> Sure, but its just one symptom of the bigger problem
[08:36:10] <johnbender> which is the duplication of effort?
[08:36:11] <jzaefferer> jQuery Mobile started as a fork of jQuery UI, but became a almost completelty seperate project. The two parallel CSS frameworks are a much bigger problem, though that isn't really on your plate
[08:36:18] <johnbender> right
[08:36:52] <jzaefferer> dependency management, download builder, themeroller, you name it
[08:37:11] <jzaefferer> branch preview, grunt/make, test automation
[08:37:37] <johnbender> for the last three I don't really see how that's hurting either project
[08:38:00] <jzaefferer> once you've got grunt working, you should add js/css/html linting
[08:38:13] <jzaefferer> js lint is built into grunt, I've got grunt-plugins for css and html
[08:38:25] <jzaefferer> That's where you'll start to get some actual value out of it ;)
[08:39:11] <johnbender> as for dep management even if we had known about your plans for the plugin site I'm not convinced that it makes sense with the way jqm is built
[08:39:53] <johnbender> that issue basically dictates the dowload builder and we're basically back to the issue of the themeroller which is mostly the css :/
[08:40:01] <jzaefferer> branch preview: We can share the code for that, no need to duplicate maintenance
[08:40:12] <johnbender> theres no maintenance on our part ...
[08:40:17] <jzaefferer> grunt: We're building a lot of infrastructure on top of that, there's a lot of value
[08:40:23] <johnbender> yep
[08:40:27] <johnbender> and we're migrating as we speak
[08:40:30] <johnbender> :D
[08:41:06] <johnbender> but unless the infrastructure is on a windows machine we could call it a day after moving the bash scripts into grunt
[08:41:10] <jzaefferer> test automation: testswarm/jenkins/browserstack has gotten ten times better in the last few weeks. Deployed 1.0.0-alpha over the weekend. There's now a node-testswarm module that replaces the crappy java-jenkins-testswarm plugin
[08:41:40] <johnbender> that's great
[08:42:20] <johnbender> that _vast_ majority of our bugs are css per platform save for a few dark areas in history management and orientation change
[08:42:32] <johnbender> the latter of which wouldn't get tested anyhow
[08:42:41] <jzaefferer> Generally if there's something the project is already building, we should use it pretty much everywhere. Even if it needs some effort now to migrate, there's a lot of value in getting that consistency in the long run
[08:43:03] <jzaefferer> oh yeah, I recently noticed that the orientation change stuff wasn't getting tested :p
[08:43:15] <jzaefferer> There wasn't even a visual test page if I remember correctly
[08:43:19] <Wilto> We got a functional test in there, J-Z.
[08:43:33] <Wilto> Nothing in the way of unit testing, though.
[08:43:38] <johnbender> I agree we shouldn't have two ways to do things but the effort for value proposition doesn't always make it obvious
[08:43:44] <jzaefferer> Well, I didn't find anything at the time
[08:43:53] <Wilto> jzaefferer: tests/functional/orientation.html
[08:47:09] <jzaefferer> thanks Wilto
[08:47:31] <Wilto> Sure thing, man.
[08:49:14] <jzaefferer> Meh, why is there no way to search for tickets created by myself?
[09:56:25] <gnarf> jzaefferer: you should submit that as feedback
[09:56:30] <gnarf> Issues already has it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pulls/jzaefferer
[09:56:43] <gnarf> er sorry pulls already hals it
[09:56:53] <gnarf> but issues doesn't seem to like that argument :)

[12:13:00] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Merge pull request #4244 from MauriceG/patch-89 - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[12:26:32] <toddparker> jzaefferer: mobile didn't really start as a fork of UI, it was a clean slate project
[12:26:43] <toddparker> we used the widget factory, but that's about all
[12:27:09] <toddparker> agcolom: looks like you're all up to speed on git
[12:43:01] <johnbender> jzaefferer: how do you  define grunt task dependencies for a custom task?
[12:43:15] <johnbender> jzaefferer: I'm sure it's in the docs somewhere but I'm having a hard time finding it
[12:43:24] <johnbender> the only thing I've spotted is how to require that they've run
[12:43:32] <johnbender> but that doesn't actually execute them as dependencies
[12:46:10] <Wilto> Whenever he’s back around, I’m gonna see if Ben Alman wouldn’t mind lurking in here to help out with the Grunt stuff.
[12:46:20] <Wilto> johnbender, toddparker, er’rybody else: ^
[12:46:46] <johnbender> Wilto: lets wait on that
[12:47:01] <johnbender> this is my first day and 99% of the issues will be a result of the newness
[12:47:11] <Wilto> johnbender: Roger.
[12:47:28] <johnbender> most of it is pretty strait forward I just can't find any info in the docs about this and I can't find any examples
[12:47:45] <johnbender> *straightfoward
[12:47:49] <johnbender> *straightforward
[12:47:53] * johnbender sighs
[12:48:24] <Wilto> “good”
[12:48:28] <Wilto> NAILED IT
[12:59:29] <rworth> johnbender I had the same concern was I was just starting out. Discussed with Ben Alman in #grunt. This is by design. You have to call dependent tasks manually using an alias task
[13:02:22] <agcolom> toddparker: yes, but I played safe with gseguin on irc to make sure I wasn't making any mistake!!!
[13:15:20] <toddparker> great, good to see you're up in running
[13:16:45] <agcolom> there's a problem though with the php pages
[13:16:59] <agcolom> they don't pick up <script src="../../js/"></script> correctly
[13:17:20] <agcolom> we get a 403
[13:23:47] <gseguin> agcolom: is that still the case?
[13:24:09] <agcolom> yes
[13:24:18] <agcolom> we get 403 just on the ../../js/
[13:24:34] <gseguin> can you send me a pointer?
[13:24:50] <agcolom> what is a pointer?? http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/forms-sample-selfsubmit.php ?
[13:24:59] <gseguin> yeah sorry a url
[13:25:58] * gseguin looks
[13:27:23] <Wilto> Is this our first official “DAMMIT, ANNE?”
[13:27:35] <agcolom> yes !!!
[13:27:36] <gseguin> lol
[13:27:37] <Wilto> agcolom: Just so you know, whenever someone finds a problem? Completely their fault.
[13:28:04] <agcolom> so scary, seriously!!! I feel the pressure!!!
[13:28:05] <Wilto> Alternately: blame Scott Jehl.
[13:29:01] <gseguin> johnbender: ^ any idea why http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/ returns 403 ?
[13:29:42] <agcolom> Also there are some <button> that close with </submit> ...
[13:30:21] <Wilto> wat
[13:30:58] <agcolom> yes ;-) no me ;-)
[13:31:04] <Wilto> DAMMIT, SCOTT
[13:32:16] <agcolom> where are you all anyway?? I'm confused with the timezones!
[13:33:01] <Wilto> Boston for toddparker and I. Scott is in the Himalayas.
[13:33:18] <Wilto> Er’rybody else is on the left coast, I think.
[13:33:34] <gseguin> otherwise know as the cool coast
[13:33:38] <toddparker> anne get your gun
[13:33:40] <gseguin> s/know/known
[13:33:50] <Wilto> We’re the angry coast.
[13:34:18] <agcolom> Send us some sunshine if you've got any We've just had 2 weeks of rain! SOLID!
[13:34:46] <agcolom> I didn't know there was an angry coast!

[13:36:56] <toddparker> we're surly, not angry
[13:37:03] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I can't reproduce your popup transition blinking, even though I've switched to Chrome 19. I am running on Linux though ...
[13:37:12] <toddparker> linux!
[13:37:19] <toddparker> i'm on windows ME
[13:37:32] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Well, there's your problem! :)
[13:37:32] <agcolom> Ah! I get it! BTW I'm going to be a bit busy after wednesday. It's my 1st year exam, I'll have 176 scripts to mark... should take a few days... maybe 3...
[13:37:58] <toddparker> let me look at the branch preview - look alike just landed some improvements
[13:38:12] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: None related to the transitions.
[13:38:40] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I pretty much left those alone. It was more about handover between popups and "concurrency" within a single popup.
[13:41:33] <_|Nix|_> You guys keep forgetting about poor old me, north of 60
[13:41:56] <_|Nix|_> ... and across /the other/ pond wrt. Scott ...
[13:42:02] <toddparker> i just grabbed latest form pop-widget
[13:42:19] <toddparker> and when i close each, it skips me back to the homepage
[13:42:29] <toddparker> thought that was working better before?
[13:42:39] <toddparker> _|Nix|_ ^^
[13:43:35] <_|Nix|_> Egads!
[13:43:36] <johnbender> gseguin: none
[13:43:48] <toddparker> but it's ok on safari
[13:43:54] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm goin to guess permissions
[13:43:56] <johnbender> checking that
[13:43:57] <toddparker> maybe there is a cache issue
[13:44:04] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: What browser is that happening on?
[13:44:18] <gseguin> johnbender: what changed? That used to work didn't it?
[13:44:30] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[13:44:31] <agcolom> if we're talking 403 I'm seeing on FF
[13:44:39] <gseguin> Could my adding of the ProxyPass cause this?
[13:44:45] <agcolom> The same code works for 1.0.1
[13:44:57] <johnbender> dunno
[13:45:09] <gseguin> I kinda doubt it
[13:45:20] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0.1/docs/forms/forms-sample-selfsubmit.php
[13:45:24] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I tried it both on FF 11 and Chrome 19 and they're both fine.
[13:45:34] <toddparker> FF is fine too
[13:45:41] <toddparker> my chrome is wacked
[13:45:54] <toddparker> looks good
[13:45:57] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: What is the exact version number of your Chrome?
[13:46:04] <toddparker> we should map the Esc to close the popup too
[13:46:17] <Wilto> +1
[13:46:20] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Not bad ...
[13:46:52] <johnbender> ugh
[13:46:52] <johnbender> the connection to the server is dirt slow :(
[13:47:30] <johnbender> hmm
[13:47:31] <johnbender> well
[13:47:33] <gseguin> johnbender, agcolom: I know what's goingin on
[13:47:35] <johnbender> the index.php isn't tehre
[13:47:36] <gseguin> jqadmin@swarm-01:~/jqm/test/js$ pwd

[13:47:36] <gseguin> ls: index.php: No such file or directory
[13:47:41] <johnbender> lol
[13:47:44] <gseguin> exactly
[13:47:44] <johnbender> I SAID IT FIRST
[13:47:47] <johnbender> :D
[13:47:49] <gseguin> man!
[13:48:00] <agcolom> ah!
[13:48:10] <johnbender> did we remove it from the repo?
[13:48:43] <johnbender> newp
[13:48:46] <johnbender> it's still there in master
[13:49:50] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: Chrome Version 19.0.1084.30 beta
[13:50:03] <toddparker> after cleaning cache, the navigation back issue is gone
[13:50:13] <toddparker> but it does blink like heck when the animation comes in
[13:50:29] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: 19.0.1084.36 beta here, and it's fine ...
[13:50:47] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, like, 6 builds later ...
[13:51:08] <gseguin> johnbender: are you taking care of it ?
[13:51:16] <johnbender> yah
[13:51:28] <gseguin> thanks!
[13:51:39] <johnbender> gseguin: it's in no branch land which is wrong/bad
[13:52:01] <gseguin> weird
[13:52:29] <gseguin> "detached head" in the git jargon, as scary as it sounds...
[13:53:08] <agcolom> if that helps, 1.1.0 also has the same issue
[13:53:28] <johnbender> gseguin: actually I take that back
[13:53:28] <johnbender> it never worked lol
[13:53:33] <johnbender> it points at the compiled emos
[13:53:36] <johnbender> *demos
[13:53:45] <johnbender> so it hasn't worked since I made that symlink
[13:54:14] <johnbender> jan 30
[13:54:27] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: ^
[13:54:28] <agcolom> not bad!!!
[13:55:26] <johnbender> toddparker: gseguin: is that something we need working?
[13:56:46] <gseguin> johnbender: why is it pointing at /js instead of the built bundle?
[13:57:01] <Wilto> “Compiled emos.”
[13:57:02] <agcolom> I'm going to have to go in a minute... I guess you don't need me for this...
[13:57:08] <johnbender> gseguin: I don't know what you mean
[13:57:09] <Wilto> It previously pointed at a Hot Topic store.
[13:57:25] <gseguin> thanks for reporting agcolom
[13:57:27] <johnbender> Wilto: hilarious typos are hilarious
[13:57:47] <johnbender> gseguin: what's pointing at /js
[13:57:54] <gseguin> that page
[13:58:03] <agcolom> no problem :-) you're welcome and Thanks again for helping with the git stuff
[13:58:21] <gseguin> agcolom: you're very welcome
[13:58:38] <agcolom> I'll correct those closing mismatching tags tomorrow.
[13:59:02] <gseguin> don't we replace the src="/js" by src="../js/jquery.mobile.js" in the Makefile ?
[13:59:14] <johnbender> yes

[13:59:21] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone... (although it's only early afternoon for some of you...)
[13:59:23] <johnbender> did someone report and issue?
[13:59:25] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ^
[13:59:27] <johnbender> I'm missing something
[13:59:31] <johnbender> agcolom: gnight!
[13:59:40] <gseguin> later agcolom
[13:59:44] <_|Nix|_> L8R
[13:59:58] <gseguin> johnbender: agcolom just did (no issue logged though )
[14:00:01] <Wilto> Later on, Anne.
[14:00:09] <gseguin> that page doesn't get processed
[14:00:16] <gseguin> and still points at /js
[14:00:33] <gseguin> makes more sense?
[14:01:20] <johnbender> yah, I should have scrolled up in the first place sorry :(
[14:01:25] <johnbender> I'll take a look at why it's not catching that
[14:01:32] <gseguin> ok
[14:01:35] <gseguin> thank you
[14:03:01] <toddparker> goodnight _|Nix|_ and agcolom
[14:03:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Sorry - I meant to direct that at agcolom :)
[14:03:23] <gseguin> later _|Nix|_
[14:03:42] <_|Nix|_> Not leaving yet - though it's getting to be about that time ...
[14:03:48] <toddparker> heh, sorry _
[14:03:52] <toddparker> _|Nix|_
[14:03:57] <_|Nix|_> I was saying L8R /to/ agcolom ..
[14:04:08] <gseguin> oh ok
[14:04:10] <gseguin> sorry
[14:04:42] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, what's the verdict? Bad Chrome?
[14:04:43] <toddparker> so _|Nix|_ i do see a nasty blink on chrome
[14:04:54] <toddparker> but that just may be transitions being blink on chrome
[14:04:55] <_|Nix|_> OK ... can you screencast it?
[14:05:17] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I dunno ... my chrome's always been fine wrt. transitions ...
[14:05:49] <_|Nix|_> Actually, the problem with screencasts is that they probably don't capture the blinkage ...
[14:06:18] <_|Nix|_> ... be real nice to reproduce ...
[14:06:37] <toddparker> mat sees it too
[14:06:50] <toddparker> (Wilto)
[14:07:03] <Wilto> After clicking a few buttons.
[14:07:10] <Wilto> Refresh the page and it’s good.
[14:07:16] <Wilto> Click a couple links and it starts a-blinkin’.
[14:07:21] <_|Nix|_> After clicking a few buttons you say ...
[14:07:30] <Wilto> Chrome 18 here.
[14:07:37] <Wilto> Wondering if something isn’t getting left behind in the DOM?
[14:08:02] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: at what point?
[14:08:03] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: join.me/toddparker
[14:08:11] <johnbender> gseguin: well that was easy
[14:08:13] <johnbender> lol
[14:08:35] <gseguin> oh yeah?
[14:08:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Looking ...
[14:08:39] <gseguin> what was it?
[14:08:43] <toddparker> ok, you can see my screen?
[14:08:55] <toddparker> demo'ing the popup blink in chrome
[14:09:27] <toddparker> _|Nix|_ ^^
[14:09:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Didn't see anything ... it's insanely slow ...
[14:09:43] <toddparker> ah, right
[14:09:49] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Try again ...
[14:09:51] <toddparker> lemme click around again
[14:10:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Why do you have fade on? I turned it off with the latest changes.
[14:10:59] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: It must not have built the latest branch preview yet, or something.
[14:12:44] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The lack of fade would probably improve the quality of the screencast, too, because it wouldn't have to re-send the entire browser window ...
[14:12:50] <Wilto> _|Nix|_: No idea; just taking a stab with that.
[14:13:38] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I don't actually add/remove anything to/from the DOM ... I just add/remove classes to/from the the popup container ...
[14:13:53] <Wilto> Ah, right, right.
[14:15:08] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Were you also looking at the version that had the background fade on?
[14:15:26] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: I'm curious if the lack of fading might cure the blinkage.
[14:19:31] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: You also running OSX?
[14:19:37] <Wilto> Yessir.
[14:20:01] <_|Nix|_> Well, IINM, a pattern's beginning to emerge ... Chrome on OSX ...
[14:21:37] <toddparker> yeah, i should shut that off, lemme check _|Nix|_
[14:22:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: You can turn off the fade for all popups with $("[data-role='popup']").popup("option", "fade", false);
[14:22:47] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... or by grabbing the latest popup-widget ...
[14:25:24] <toddparker> fade: false
[14:25:40] <toddparker> i still get the popup object blinking when the transition finishes
[14:27:05] <toddparker> with transition set to none, no blink

[14:28:48] <gseguin> johnbender: that was easy
[14:28:54] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: *scratch head* ... not really sure what else it could be ... can you apply the pop ( in | reverse out ) sequence to some other element and check whether you get the same effect?
[14:28:56] <gseguin> thanks!
[14:29:41] <johnbender> gseguin: yah waiting for the build to finish to make sure but just a stupid mistake :(

[14:30:22] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] address php files in the demo build - John Bender
[14:32:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Thanks to the power of jQuery I just hijacked some random element and added first "pop", then "in", then I removed "in" and added "reverse out".
[14:33:05] <toddparker> ok _|Nix|_ - seems like the blink happens with transitions that use scale
[14:33:09] <toddparker> (pop and flow)
[14:33:17] <_|Nix|_> Aha ...
[14:33:18] <_|Nix|_> OK ...
[14:33:19] <toddparker> all the others are blink-free
[14:33:20] <Wilto> We have done extensive research.
[14:33:22] <toddparker> even flip
[14:33:25] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: maybe you guys know something about this page?
[14:33:25] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:33:34] <johnbender> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/forms-sample-selfsubmit.php
[14:33:34] <toddparker> (it's not very flippy)
[14:33:37] <Wilto> johnbender: I DIDN’T DO IT
[14:33:49] <Wilto> —what in the
[14:33:52] <johnbender> it's fixed
[14:34:00] <toddparker> nice code @wilto
[14:34:08] <johnbender> but the php in there seems to make some strange output
[14:34:11] <toddparker> html for dummies for homework tonight
[14:34:20] <toddparker> ok, php for dummies
[14:34:21] <Wilto> Wasn’t me, man.
[14:34:27] <Wilto> My PHP is _dope_.
[14:34:28] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, should I use a different transition?
[14:34:50] <toddparker> guess so
[14:34:55] <toddparker> maybe we use fade by default
[14:35:07] <toddparker> tho that's the default page transition so shouldn't that work
[14:35:17] <Wilto> Unless we can track down something else in the .pop classes that could be causing it.
[14:35:23] <toddparker> ah, i see
[14:35:32] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Funny thing is I use $.mobile.defaultDialogTransition ... do dialogs blink like that?
[14:35:34] <toddparker> yeah, we may need a defaultPopupTransition
[14:35:38] <toddparker> no
[14:35:49] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So I must be doing something wrong.
[14:36:03] <toddparker> not ruling that out
[14:36:48] <_|Nix|_> Well, dialogs don't really pop at all, they fade.
[14:37:40] <_|Nix|_> On the dialogs page, no matter which transition example I click, I always get fade.
[14:38:49] <toddparker> dialogs use pop
[14:38:54] <toddparker> they are poppy
[14:38:56] <_|Nix|_> toddparke: Oh - do the custom select menus blink?
[14:39:03] <toddparker> lemme look
[14:39:52] <toddparker> yes, yes they do :/
[14:40:04] <toddparker> just normal chrome broken-ness
[14:40:31] <toddparker> it would be good to have a global setting for the default popup transition
[14:41:20] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: If I go to page-transitions.html, the only transition that does something different is slidefade ...
[14:41:30] <toddparker> this is a question for johnbender and gseguin - i think we should have a default popup transition option
[14:41:34] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: All others just fade for me - no pop, no flip, no nothing.
[14:41:48] <toddparker> but should this be a global option like page and dialog default transitions
[14:41:59] <toddparker> or just a setting within the popup plugin?
[14:42:14] <toddparker> ah, your browser doesn't support 3D transforms
[14:42:20] <toddparker> so we fall back to fade
[14:42:32] <toddparker> we have a feature detect for that
[14:42:40] <_|Nix|_> Aha ... OK ...
[14:42:47] <toddparker> since android 2.x and others were making a mess with a lot of these advanced animaitons
[14:42:51] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: That may be why I don't see the blink.
[14:42:55] <toddparker> yep
[14:43:01] <toddparker> we're takin git easy on you
[14:43:07] <toddparker> my hunch is this is a chrome bug
[14:43:18] <toddparker> since FF and safari are smooth
[14:43:25] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I wonder if I can turn on the 3D transforms ...
[14:43:39] <toddparker> dunno
[14:43:41] <toddparker> probably not
[14:43:56] <toddparker> have access to a mac?
[14:44:06] <toddparker> or an iOS device?
[14:44:49] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Unfortunately not ... I keep prodding my manager, but so far, no dice.
[14:45:06] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: However, this is a clear and present necessity, so I hope this'll do the trick.
[14:45:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We also have some pretty potent webkit d00ds on our team, so they may know how to get these 3D transforms going ...
[14:46:41] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: But that's gonna have to wait till 2012-05-02, because 2012-05-01 is a holiday here ...

[14:56:56] <gseguin> kinblas: yup
[14:57:05] <gseguin> we're going to need to address that
[14:57:12] <kinblas> uh yeah :-)
[14:58:03] <_|Nix|_> Nighterz, y'all!
[14:58:11] <gseguin> later _|Nix|_
[15:06:55] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[15:07:03] <johnbender> can we ask Scott to revert that?
[15:07:38] <johnbender> toddparker: it's a widget so it should be a widget prototype option
[15:14:00] <toddparker> thanks _|Nix|_
[15:14:24] <toddparker> johnbender: scott is literally climbing everest right now :)
[15:14:53] <toddparker> so if you guys want to revert this, we can
[15:15:04] <toddparker> i think this was just for the URL bar dropping in iOS, right kinblas
[15:19:01] <johnbender> toddparker: well reverting it before the next stable release
[15:19:38] <gseguin> johnbender: does that mean 1.1.1 as well ?
[15:20:18] <kinblas> toddparker: right
[15:20:22] <johnbender> yah
[15:20:30] <johnbender> gseguin: to me it's a bug fix :P
