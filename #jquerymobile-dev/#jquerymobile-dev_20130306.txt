[05:59:53] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Here's another one you may consider adding to your Webkit-is-the-new-OldIE arsenal: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5733#issuecomment-14500355
[06:00:39] <DaveMethvin> whoa
[06:01:55] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Yeah ... forget navigating on startup in Webkit :)
[06:01:58] <DaveMethvin> just pinged mkwst in #jquery-dev about it, he's on the webkit team at google
[06:02:12] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Cool!
[06:06:51] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Here's another (possibly related?) issue I posted a while back that was completely ignored: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!topic/chromium-discuss/MRuhXVHdCc8 ... I posted this one to both Chromium-devel and Chromium-discuss, and to no avail.
[06:09:39] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_  can you hop over to #jquery-dev and talk to mkwst?
[06:09:52] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Sure!

[09:00:40] <johnbender> gseguin: ping
[09:00:50] <gseguin> johnbender: hiya!
[09:00:57] <johnbender> gseguin: amazing progress man
[09:00:57] <gseguin> johnbender: 'sup?
[09:01:03] <johnbender> gseguin: where do we stand with the builds
[09:01:08] <johnbender> obviously still crashing on jenkins
[09:01:16] <gseguin> johnbender: thanks!
[09:01:32] <gseguin> johnbender: the controlgroup test is highly unstable
[09:01:49] <johnbender> gseguin: is that easy to reproduce?
[09:01:49] <gseguin> johnbender: but the rest of the tests run well on TravisCI
[09:02:02] <johnbender> gseguin: ie, if I run it a couple times locally will it bork?
[09:02:05] <gseguin> johnbender: unfortunately not
[09:02:23] <gseguin> johnbender: It had never failed on my workspace
[09:02:42] <johnbender> gseguin: brutal
[09:02:45] <johnbender> hmm
[09:03:29] <johnbender> gseguin: it looks like they are all unit / non-async tests o.O
[09:03:46] <gseguin> johnbender: could be the problem
[09:04:20] <johnbender> gseguin: I was thinking I would go in and maybe redo the tests but htye are simple and probably fast :)
[09:04:30] <johnbender> gseguin: I've had issues with tests finishing too quickly
[09:04:40] <johnbender> before the qunit injection happens
[09:04:53] <johnbender> gseguin: that is the qunit callbacks injected by grunt
[09:05:22] <johnbender> gseguin: let me go look at the logs reas quick
[09:06:05] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm, doesn't look like that's the case here
[09:06:46] <gseguin> cool
[09:07:07] <gseguin> and if you fix that then I think we might just forget about Jenkins for now
[09:07:33] <gseguin> because it seems very hard to figure out what causes PhantomJS to crash
[09:10:36] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm curious how it chooses the binary
[09:10:48] <johnbender> gseguin: given that node modules are meant to be xplatform
[09:10:54] <johnbender> maybe that's a poor assumption
[09:11:06] <gseguin> johnbender: uname ?
[09:11:22] <gseguin> johnbender: and it works for 3 suites, not more
[09:11:27] <johnbender> gseguin: does it include binaries for all the supported platforms in the npm package?
[09:11:32] <johnbender> gseguin: ah
[09:11:39] <johnbender> gseguin: still curious how that works though
[09:12:02] <gseguin> if you login to the Jenkins it's easy to repro
[09:12:27] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I was wondering if we could expose the stderr more directly
[09:12:39] <johnbender> I think the node module eats it
[09:13:20] <johnbender> gseguin: I know that because it was vommiting because it expects fontconfig
[09:13:25] <johnbender> but told me I had installed it worng
[09:13:32] <johnbender> if it it had just forwarded the stderr output
[09:13:35] <johnbender> I would have known up front
[09:13:44] <johnbender> three chears for swallowing errors :/
[09:13:49] <johnbender> s/chears/cheers/
[09:13:55] <Wilto> Meta.
[09:14:22] <johnbender> gseguin: actually I'm going to go file that issue now
[09:19:33] <johnbender> gseguin: already there
[09:19:37] <johnbender> plus one'd it
[09:19:47] <johnbender> gseguin: it checks for exit on 127
[09:19:58] <johnbender> which can mean more things than just "command not found"
[09:20:15] <johnbender> it looks like it's used for missing modules by convention
[09:20:57] <johnbender> gseguin: are you giving that a whirl or should I
[09:21:06] <johnbender> I'm happy to monkey around with it
[09:21:09] <gseguin> johnbender: I can't
[09:21:27] <gseguin> johnbender: Busy on Jive stuff
[09:23:17] <johnbender> gseguin: ok I'll go monkey
[09:23:34] <gseguin> johnbender: cool, please share your findings
[09:46:18] <agcolom> Wilto: ping
[09:46:32] <Wilto> Pong.
[09:47:07] <agcolom> you are nominated in the category "brilliant newcomer of the year" for the .net magazine awards 2013 :-)
[09:47:35] <agcolom> (I think i might be a bit responsible for that so I hope you don't mind ;-) )
[09:47:38] <agcolom> http://www.thenetawards.com/
[09:48:46] <Wilto> Aww, I was wondering what that was all about!
[09:49:01] <agcolom> Sorry ;-)
[09:49:06] <Wilto> As long as you don’t tell them I’m not brilliant nor new, I might just be able to get away with it.
[09:49:43] <Wilto> `picture` and `srcset` are on there too, which is hilarious.
[09:50:05] <agcolom> yes, I'm not responsible for those....
[09:50:21] <Wilto> And A11y Project.
[09:50:24] <Wilto> busy year
[09:50:29] <agcolom> I did put JQM everywhere as well, but it's not new enough anymore I think...
[09:50:41] <Wilto> This is the one we won last year, yeah?
[09:50:45] <Wilto> Was that last year…?
[09:50:52] <agcolom> yes, it was actually 2 years ago.
[09:50:58] <Wilto> Time flies.
[09:51:05] <agcolom> there didn't have awards last year
[09:51:26] <agcolom> and grunt is nominated too, which is very good!
[09:51:30] <Wilto> Ah, that explains it.
[09:51:40] <Wilto> Grunt is dope. I’d vote for Grunt fifty times.
[09:51:52] <Wilto> And CodePen. Lotta good stuff on there.

[09:55:56] <agcolom> surprised that jsbin is not there. I did nominate it but it's a tough competition
[09:57:08] <Wilto> Oh, Remy is a judge.
[10:13:27] <agcolom> oh, ok, that may explain it... but then FF OS is there and Chris is a judge...
[10:14:18] <Wilto> Hm, true…
[10:25:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender, gseguin, uGoMobi, arschmitz: How do we feel about making https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/64030496e3d13fea0d3c4d24bba1ed8c808f1e14/js/jquery.mobile.buttonMarkup.js#L13-L19 (getAttrFixed()) available to other parts of the lib via $.mobile._getAttrFixed()? In https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5732 Changsuk wants to use it in various places as he replaces jqmData()-based gets/sets with get/setAttribut
[10:25:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: blerg
[10:25:54] <johnbender> I was hoping for a moritorium on all $.mobile objects
[10:27:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hmmm ... trying to think of an alternative. Making stuff available across modules should not /require/ tacking stuff onto $.mobile ...
[10:28:40] <arschmitz> im kind of tossed i agree with johnbender about not bloating $.mobile
[10:28:57] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I wonder ... can we pass around a private object via define()?
[10:29:47] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: lemme take a look in like two mins
[10:32:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: not like I'm going to come up with life altering alternative 
[10:34:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I like the idea of defining it as a module return but there are issues with that in built version
[10:34:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: even if we just add another sub object
[10:38:20] <johnbender> that would be better
[10:51:14] <gnarf> gseguin: any chance you'd be willing to help the whole set of jquery projects evaluate getting testing with travis?
[10:51:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: $.mobile._private ... ?
[10:52:03] <gseguin> gnarf: if they're using grunt it's really not hard, I can help with that
[10:55:24] <gnarf> gseguin: also, do you know if you can get public ip/port on travis vm?
[10:55:33] <gnarf> so like we can request real browsers from an API to connect?
[11:00:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: something like that
[11:00:25] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm going to focus on the travis tests
[11:01:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that makes it pretty clear what the intent is at least
[11:02:59] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: so I have a confesion to make
[11:03:04] <johnbender> though I don't see how this would matter
[11:03:34] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I stole the command from the source since I don't have the grunt binary installed globally 
[11:03:38] <johnbender> node node_modules/.bin/grunt build:*:*:-effects uglify dist
[11:03:42] <johnbender> :P
[11:03:53] <johnbender> but it does say "excluding --effects
[11:03:56] <johnbender> err
[11:04:04] <johnbender> Excluding effects
[11:04:10] <DaveMethvin> you can install grunt-cli
[11:04:22] <DaveMethvin> i use custom:-effects
[11:04:24] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I know I *can* it's just that I don't want to :)
[11:04:34] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: let me make sure I'm not doing it wrong first 
[11:04:37] <johnbender> before I bother you further
[11:04:46] <DaveMethvin> look at the header on the file and see what it says
[11:04:54] <DaveMethvin> oh you did
[11:05:08] <DaveMethvin> strange that there is a double dash
[11:07:49] <DaveMethvin> when i use grunt custom:-effects it gives me "jQuery JavaScript Library v2.0.0pre -effects" in the header
[11:11:01] <asheppard> i'm sure this has been discussed before, but why not use AMD in the build process?
[11:11:41] <asheppard> thus making the private-object-as-amd-module approach feasible
[11:14:04] <DaveMethvin> asheppard sure although right now we can have jQuery "globals" in one scope which saves a property lookup
[11:14:13] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: not sure what was happening earlier but it's working just fine now
[11:14:20] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: effects is 3k gzipped
[11:14:25] <DaveMethvin> sounds right
[11:14:29] <johnbender> well a little less
[11:14:36] <DaveMethvin> i don't think it gives errors on bad input
[11:14:39] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: sorry I'm lame
[11:14:43] <DaveMethvin> so -hahaha
[11:26:45] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15efesar opened issue #5738: jqmData documentation missing from API site  02http://git.io/xSbI6g
[11:39:45] <johnbender> gseguin: it looks like I can get it to fail regularly
[11:39:48] <johnbender> if not all the time
[11:39:54] <johnbender> not doing anything special though
[11:39:59] <johnbender> at least I can debug
[11:50:34] <Wilto> johnbender: You’re a dude what loves logical fallacies, right?
[11:51:03] <Wilto> “I think X.” “I think Y.” “Prove Y.” “I can’t prove Y.” “X is the obvious winner.”
[11:51:06] <Wilto> Is there a name for that?
[11:52:09] <johnbender> Wilto: hmmm
[11:52:39] <Wilto> There should be some kinda search engine for logical fallacies.
[11:52:54] <Wilto> Anyway. Web standards is super fun.
[11:53:10] <Wilto> Maybe related, maybe not. *Who knows*.
[11:53:11] <johnbender> Wilto: boils down to, "that's wrong so this must be right"
[11:53:42] <johnbender> that's only if one is the logical negation of the other other
[11:54:14] <johnbender> I think
[11:54:55] <johnbender> Wilto:  let me see if I can find somethin
[12:00:47] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm not one hundred percent on this
[12:00:58] <johnbender> but it looks a lot like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_a_disjunct
[12:01:17] <johnbender> except a negation is distributed
[12:01:26] <johnbender> Y or X
[12:01:32] <johnbender> err
[12:01:36] <johnbender> X or Y
[12:01:48] <Wilto> Hm; this seems to check out.
[12:01:49] <johnbender> so X not Y
[12:02:11] <johnbender> Wilto doesn't quite fit
[12:02:28] <johnbender> there's also "shifting the burden of proof"
[12:02:33] <gseguin> johnbender: oh, that's "good" news
[12:02:36] <johnbender> ie, "you can't prove me wrong so I must be right"
[12:02:49] <Wilto> Ah, right. Maybe a little of both, here.
[12:03:06] <johnbender> Wilto: let me think about it a bit more
[12:03:27] <johnbender> gseguin: also it's a timing issue with ui-screen-hidden
[12:03:30] <johnbender> gseguin: that's what's causing the problem
[12:03:58] <gseguin> johnbender: so that shouldn't take too long to fix now, cool
[12:05:16] <gseguin> gnarf, do you want me to do PR for the travis CI thing?
[12:05:21] <johnbender> gseguin: looks like a bug
[12:05:34] <johnbender> gseguin: not sure why it's in there
[12:05:50] <gseguin> johnbender: does it kwak like a bug ?
[12:05:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ping
[12:06:20] <johnbender> gseguin: _|Nix|_ wrote the code so hopefully he can help
[12:06:35] <gnarf> gseguin: work with scott_gonzalez or jzaefferer or DaveMethvin to work on it?
[12:06:41] <gnarf> for one of the other teams
[12:06:55] <gnarf> mikesherov too?
[12:07:07] <gnarf> i think mikesherov has interest in getting this across the projects as well
[12:07:28] <gseguin> ok I'll ping him
[12:08:06] <johnbender> gseguin: seriously awesome
[12:08:10] <johnbender> :)
[12:08:51] <gseguin> johnbender: hey thanks, it was litteraly 15 lines of not even code
[12:12:23] <johnbender> gseguin: what?
[12:12:33] <johnbender> gseguin: the server?
[12:12:52] <gseguin> no the Travis CI thing 
[12:12:58] <johnbender> gseguin: yah the config
[12:13:06] <gseguin> I thought that's what you were referring to
[12:13:07] <johnbender> gseguin: but getting us moved over to js was more work than that eh?
[12:13:12] <johnbender> eg, off php
[12:13:15] <johnbender> combine etc
[12:13:31] <gseguin> oh that, yeah that was kinda of a pain
[12:13:48] <gseguin> but a good way to learn Grunt ;)
[12:14:30] <gseguin> yeah we're off PHP for testing and that is awesome!
[12:16:33] <johnbender> gseguin: so good
[12:16:34] <johnbender> lolol
[12:16:55] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll take node over php :)
[12:17:43] <gseguin> heh :)

[12:52:37] <johnbender> gseguin: oops I might be wrong about that controlgroup issue
[12:54:05] <gseguin> johnbender: wront in what way? that it's a timing issue or that it's a possible bug?
[12:56:13] <johnbender> gseguin: there's a timing issue
[12:56:43] <johnbender> the checkboxradio (which is a dependency in the asyncLoad call) is running it's buttonMarkup bit after the  tests start
[12:56:49] <johnbender> gseguin: correction
[12:56:51] <johnbender> correction
[12:57:26] <johnbender> the stuff that becomes buttons in the control group in this case checkbox radio buttons, has to run before the control group does it's initial create
[12:57:34] <johnbender> it expects them to be enhanced already
[12:57:44] <johnbender> because it selects on .ui-btn
[12:58:19] <johnbender> gseguin: this is an interested dependency issue
[12:58:48] <johnbender> gseguin: a naive way to say this would be "controlgroup depends on at least one of the form widgets that produces buttons"
[12:59:43] <johnbender> we either have to make it select on things that might become buttons or run after any of those dependencies o.o
[13:01:20] <johnbender> dependently determined dependencies lolol
[13:05:32] <gseguin> johnbender: it's like init
[13:05:52] <johnbender> gseguin: yah
[13:05:58] <johnbender> gseguin: it's pretty easy to reproduce
[13:06:13] <johnbender> gseguin: just have to add a log statement to the checkboxradio _create
[13:06:17] <gseguin> I haven't found an automated solution to the problem
[13:06:25] <johnbender> and then a log statement to the referesh in controlgroup
[13:06:47] <johnbender> gseguin: yah we just need to tell it to "go last"
[13:06:50] <johnbender> which is lame 
[13:07:10] <johnbender> gseguin: at some point this will eventually be painful enough that we'll want to actually build a registration system
[13:08:16] <johnbender> gseguin: hmm
[13:08:29] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm going to institute a quick fix for this
[13:08:35] <johnbender> gseguin: and I then I might do just that
[13:09:34] <johnbender> gseguin: something like
[13:09:49] <johnbender> all widgets provide a deferred that get's resolved at the end of create
[13:09:52] <johnbender> err
[13:09:54] <johnbender> _create
[13:10:28] <johnbender> so when you want to depend on something you just hand the register a list of the namespaced widgets (eg "mobile.checkboxradio" )
[13:10:52] <johnbender> and then it adds those to a new deferred which resolves when they resolve
[13:11:02] <johnbender> if none of the registerd widgets are present it resolves immediately
[13:11:12] <gseguin> that sounds like a good way of handling it
[13:11:48] <johnbender> gseguin: ok quick fix first
[13:11:54] <johnbender> gseguin: then I'm going to do that
[13:11:59] <johnbender> (in a branch)
[13:12:06] <johnbender> (obviously)
[13:13:06] <gseguin> add your branch to the list of branches to test in the master .travis.yml file so you'll get confirmation that it fixes the issue
[13:13:10] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[13:16:28] <johnbender> gseguin: well I'm fixing the issue on master but I'll branch first I suppose
[13:17:23] <gseguin> johnbender: branching first makes sense
[13:20:10] <johnbender> alright

[13:20:13] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 143092245 15John Bender: make sure control group runs after button creating widgets
[13:20:14] <johnbender> let's see if that does it
[13:20:28] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm able to reproduce locally with a couple tries
[13:21:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Interesting, because controlgroup hooks up it's enhancement hook from domready, by which time the button enhancers should already be in place.
[13:22:14] <gseguin> johnbender: controlgroup tests passed
[13:22:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There should be no race condition.
[13:22:23] <gseguin> on TravisCI
[13:24:05] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, wow! Just read your commit!
[13:25:47] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I'll trigger another Travis build after that one is over to double check that it fixed the issue
[13:25:53] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[13:26:54] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: *nod*
[13:41:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah that made sense to me but there's nothing to really say that dom ready won't already have passed
[13:41:58] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: in which case it's then dependent on load order
[13:42:05] <johnbender> which we can't define with dependencies
[13:42:14] <johnbender> because it's not dependent on one specific thing
[13:42:38] <johnbender> or at least that's how I had it sorted in my head
[13:42:51] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We need to be able to define another kind of dependency at runtime.
[13:42:53] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'm going to sort out a quick/dirty widget registry
[13:43:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: you can scroll up to see what I was thinking
[13:43:13] <johnbender> I layed it out a bit with gseguin
[13:43:21] <johnbender> laid it out
[13:44:11] <gseguin> johnbender, _|Nix|_: controlgroup tests passing twice in a row
[13:44:58] <_|Nix|_> Great!
[13:45:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Wouldn't it be simpler to create a sorted array of pagecreate handlers?
[13:46:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I guess we'd reproduce some code from requirejs, but not for the purposes of loading scripts, but for the purposes of attaching handlers in a specific order.
[13:47:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Another solution might be that controlgroup triggers create on its children ...
[13:47:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... as the first step in its own _create() method.
[13:48:39] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'd rather explicitly define the dependencies within the library
[13:48:49] <johnbender> and how do you sort the array/
[13:48:56] <johnbender> is that dony by the widget?
[13:48:58] <johnbender> *done
[13:49:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah ... I guess "sorting" is the wrong word. It's dependency resolution, really.
[13:49:24] <johnbender> $.mobile.widget.depend( "mobile.checkboxradio", function(){ enhance });
[13:50:03] <johnbender> if that widget hasn't registered a deferred, run the callback right away
[13:50:14] <johnbender> seems sane to me
[13:51:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It seems to me that we should build a dependency tree at library load time, and serialize it (or whatever that's called when you turn it into a list) after the library has finished loading.
[13:52:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... cuz what if it registers a deferred afterwards?
[13:52:30] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: we load all the widget prototypes before enhancing the page
[13:52:44] <johnbender> load everything -> enhance the page
[13:53:08] <johnbender> gseguin: ostensibly we could do this through the dependency system
[13:53:14] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's what we do now, but as you're loading everything, you need to hook up pagecreate handlers in a specific order.
[13:53:49] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right that's the problem I'm trying to solve
[13:53:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: We need a second dependency system, otherwise controlgroup will end up pulling in button and buttonMarkup and checkboxradio, which is incorrect.
[13:54:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: So, we basically need a wrapper around .on().
[13:54:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'd rather just have the widget get an even, which can stay page create, in which it says "these are my dependencies, tell me when they are done enhancing"
[13:54:32] <johnbender> s/even,/event,/
[13:54:49] <johnbender> I don't see the value in anything more complicated
[13:54:56] <johnbender> we can derive a dependency tree from that
[13:54:59] <johnbender> but there's no value
[13:55:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Some will never be done enhancing, because such widgets are not present on the page ...
[13:56:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: what do you mean?
[13:56:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: "tell me when they are done enhancing" ... 
[13:56:48] <johnbender> every widget binds to pagecreate
[13:57:07] <johnbender> whether the select finds anything to enhance or not doesn't matter
[13:57:18] <johnbender> once enhanceWithin or equivelant is run
[13:57:27] <johnbender> we resolve the deferred associated with said widget
[13:57:38] <johnbender> and that tells widgets that have dependencies on that thing to go
[13:57:45] <johnbender> some widgets won't have dependencies at all
[13:58:29] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK. I'm beginning to see. Correct me if I'm wrong: After widget x hooks up its pagecreate handler, it resolves a deferred.
[13:58:43] <johnbender> after the pagecreate handler is fired 
[13:58:45] <johnbender> err
[13:58:46] <johnbender> welll
[13:58:50] <johnbender> at the end of the page create handler
[13:58:58] <johnbender> or maybe inside enhanceWithin
[13:59:01] <johnbender> either way
[13:59:11] <johnbender> at the end of that handler it resolves it's deferred
[13:59:13] <johnbender> yes
[13:59:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Where would we store these deferreds?
[13:59:32] <johnbender> a registry of some sort
[13:59:42] <johnbender> an object that uses the widget name 
[14:00:24] <johnbender> the depend method would take a list of names and loop over the object grab all the deferreds and use $.when to created a new one with the callback
[14:01:12] <_|Nix|_> The problem is you'd have to create a new registry for each page.
[14:01:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Because a deferred once resolved can be thrown away.
[14:01:36] <johnbender> yar
[14:01:58] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, if we control the order in which pagecreate handlers are attached, we only have to worry about it once - during library load.
[14:02:10] <johnbender> correct
[14:02:16] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That attachment order will guarantee correct enhancement order for all subsequent pages.
[14:03:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OTOH, during library load we cannot be sure that all widgets have reported in just yet.
[14:03:16] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: knowing when the enhance is "done" to reset the deferreds isn't that bad/hard
[14:03:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: it would be interesting to have optional dependencies
[14:03:48] <johnbender> in require
[14:03:58] <johnbender> ie, if it exists it's a dependency 
[14:03:59] <johnbender> lol
[14:04:01] <johnbender> what a nightmare
[14:04:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I still don't like depending on event ordering
[14:04:45] <johnbender> we're at the mercy of the event system
[14:04:51] <johnbender> which has bitten us in the ass before
[14:05:17] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Then we can roll our own. That is, we have only one pagecreate handler, and an array of callbacks.
[14:06:13] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I still don't see how you insert a callback at the right place
[14:06:29] <johnbender> you have to have some association with dependencies anyway
[14:07:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: That's what I meant when I said we'd be reproducing the method requirejs uses. It also builds up a dependency tree and finally renders something linearly.
[14:08:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: However, our semantics are different. If a dependency is missing it is satisfied trivially.
[14:35:07] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm almost tempted to port the grunt thing to 1.3-stable
[14:35:30] <gseguin> so we can have Travis running on master and 1.3-stable
[14:35:41] <gseguin> Am I looking for trouble?
[14:36:10] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: what do you think?
[14:44:38] <johnbender> gseguin: did you do a rebase before merging?
[14:44:45] <johnbender> gseguin: or a merge 
[14:44:54] <gseguin> hmm don't remember
[14:45:03] <gseguin> why?
[14:45:16] <johnbender> gseguin: in the first case you can probably just slap the commits on top of 1.3 stable
[14:45:31] <johnbender> gseguin: just make sure it doesn't touch any js/ files
[14:45:35] <johnbender> well
[14:45:42] <johnbender> js functional files
[14:45:46] <johnbender> hmm
[14:45:49] <johnbender> might be risky?
[14:45:52] <johnbender> not sure
[14:46:08] <gseguin> I can just copy files accross
[14:47:25] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I dunno ... If you can separate out the work ... maybe ... 
[14:48:52] <gseguin> it's pretty much new files all the way
[14:49:25] <gseguin> I can try it out locally
[15:09:46] <gseguin> johnbender: I thought the demo move was made before 1.3 release ?
[15:37:24] <johnbender> gseguin: pretty sure it was
[15:37:41] <johnbender> gseguin|away: I didn't create the 1.3 branch (fairly sure about that)
[15:40:16] <gseguin> johnbender: it's not
[15:40:26] <gseguin> johnbender: checkout 1.3-stable
[15:40:36] <gseguin> demos are under docs
[15:41:15] <gseguin> johnbender: I take that back
[15:41:31] <gseguin> it's just that the docs dir hasn't been renamed
[15:41:36] <gseguin> I'll rename it
[16:01:48] <johnbender> gseguin: :(
