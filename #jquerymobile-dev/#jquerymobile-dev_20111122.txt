[07:40:03] <Wilto> Hey guys.
[08:38:24] <gseguin> 'morning
[08:51:09] <Wilto> So I have an idea, which is generally kind of a dangerous thing.
[08:51:35] <Wilto> kinblas, you kickin’ around in here this morning?
[09:16:07] <Wilto> Anybody? Bueller?
[09:17:45] <sven_franck> Wilto: everyone scared you have an idea?
[09:17:55] * miketaylr is
[09:18:32] <sven_franck> forgot
[09:19:01] <Wilto> As you all should be.
[09:19:38] <Wilto> So! I am in pretty serious like with jsperf.com, as you may well know.
[09:20:47] <Wilto> While refactoring the dialogs, I figured it would be a good idea to keep half an eye on how my changes are impacting performance. I’m thinking this should be a Thing we do, whenever someone is making a semi-major change—put a representative jsperf test together, and include the link in the commit message or something.
[09:21:25] <Wilto> “Show your work,” as toddmparker_ put it.
[09:21:56] <sven_franck> $.extend({playground:true}
[09:24:31] <garann> it would be cool to build in perf tests, too
[09:24:47] <garann> so you'd get that info when the project built
[09:25:21] <garann> in some sparkling utopian future, i guess..
[09:26:22] <Wilto> …We can do that?
[09:26:50] <garann> in theory
[09:26:59] <Wilto> Be careful sharing such information with a known data hoarder.
[09:27:23] <garann> heh, noted
[09:28:26] <garann> i mean, we have these unit tests.. do those get run when the project builds right now?
[09:29:05] <Wilto> Yep.
[09:29:24] <kinblas> Wilto: yeah I'm here :-)
[09:29:34] <Wilto> jqm-jenkins-bot wiles out in here if they break, too.
[09:29:45] <garann> sweet
[09:30:50] <kinblas> Wilto: you talkin' performance?
[09:30:51] <kinblas> :-)
[09:30:55] <Wilto> You know it, brah.
[09:31:32] <Wilto> And as The Keeper of the Milliseconds, I thought you might dig the semi-manditory-for-big-changes jsperf idea.
[09:31:46] <Wilto> Well. “Strongly encouraged,” anyway.
[09:34:34] <kinblas> Wilto: I like the idea of folks getting in the habit of checking code patterns they write for perf impact
[09:34:46] <kinblas> not sure how you would do something for dialog though like I thought I read above
[09:35:14] <johnbender> garann: we have a jenkins server that runs the suite on source change
[09:35:55] <johnbender> kinblas: Wilto: just beware, it's really hard to take into account all things that affect performance
[09:36:07] <Wilto> Oh, I know it.
[09:36:07] <kinblas> johnbender: +1
[09:36:34] <Wilto> Still, lots of cases where it might point out major gains/losses.
[09:36:35] <johnbender> that doesn't mean we shouldn't do it, just that you can sometimes get results that will steer you in the wrong direction
[09:40:29] <Wilto> Yeah, I wouldn’t want it to become, like “wait drop everything undo that fix—it’s 3.1415% slower.”
[09:51:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: just making some changes to eddies
[09:51:02] <johnbender> pr
[09:51:09] <johnbender> then the warning should be good to go
[10:05:11] <kinblas> johnbender: I think the parsing of the android UA for the lists-ul-record.php might be off
[10:05:33] <kinblas> johnbender: it's counting my Android 2.1 or 2.2 device as Android 5.0?
[10:10:46] <kinblas> sven_franck: ping
[10:10:57] <sven_franck> kinblas: yo
[10:11:04] <kinblas> sven_fanck: in the email what did you mean about providing enhancements for file-uploads?
[10:11:47] <sven_franck> kinblas: 1sec
[10:13:57] <sven_franck> kinblas: <input type="file"> is currently looking pretty lame on a JQM site. Even if it's not supported on all devices, JQM enhancing it would hurt?
[10:14:23] <sven_franck> example: http://www.franckreich.de/jqm/page3.html
[10:15:29] <sven_franck> kinblas: some make-up woudn't hurt.
[10:16:52] <kinblas> sven_franck: oh you're talking about the file form element
[10:17:06] <sven_franck> kinblas: correct, pardon my language
[10:17:19] <sven_franck> digging through files...
[10:17:27] <Wilto> Android 5.0! What are things like in the future, kinblas?
[10:18:04] <kinblas> Wilto: shiny ui that still can't animate correctly
[10:18:10] <Wilto> Sounds about right.
[10:20:39] <sven_franck> kinblas: back in JQM.a1 I tried myself - http://www.franckreich.de/3/members/b_importb.html
[10:22:14] <kinblas> sven_franck: so are you just wanting to dress up the button? Some platforms have both a button and textfield
[10:22:36] <kinblas> note we also are unable to submit forms with file inputs
[10:22:46] <sven_franck> kinblas: correct.
[10:22:48] <kinblas> via ajax
[10:24:47] <sven_franck> kinblas: ok. still looks ugly. I was thinking more along UI than AJAX.
[10:27:23] <kinblas> sven_franck: ok, it might take some experimentation to see if that would work. The file input is special and does not respond to things like the other elements due to security
[10:29:01] <sven_franck> kinblas: ok, will look into it, too
[10:37:51] <johnbender> toddmparker_: just pushed eddie's work with some changes
[10:38:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 6 new commits to master: http://git.io/nI120A
[10:38:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Allow local browsing of the docs without a web server - Eddie Monge
[10:38:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Ajax should be disabled instead - Eddie Monge
[10:38:08] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Add check to see if ajax should be disabled - Eddie Monge
[10:38:11] <johnbender> kinblas: that's entirely possible
[10:38:14] <kinblas> sven_franck: I just closed issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3135
[10:38:15] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3135 on jquery-mobile, reported by frequent (4h, 44m ago): plugins cannot be run on pages pulled into the DOM
[10:38:20] <kinblas> with comments
[10:41:00] <eddiemonge> johnbender: did you look at the message? the padding seemed to cause overflow-x
[10:41:51] <johnbender> eddiemonge: where?
[10:41:57] <johnbender> on a phone?
[10:42:09] <eddiemonge> in the example todd had at least
[10:42:27] <johnbender> eddiemonge: hmm, are we worried about this being served to a phone?
[10:42:42] <johnbender> that is, will the warning ever be served to a phone?
[10:42:54] <sven_franck> kinblas: THANKS! Made my day
[10:43:02] <eddiemonge> probably not
[10:43:17] <jzaefferer> hey mobile people - I'm looking for an idea or two on how to deal with the sidebar on small screens on my blog http://bassistance.de - for the most part its working good enough already, but completely hiding the sidebar isn't really an option
[10:43:32] <jzaefferer> its basically a trivial challenge in responsive design principles ;)
[10:43:53] <johnbender> jzaefferer: that counts me out, but that's a lot of content to squish
[10:44:04] <johnbender> I'll have to deferr to the designers among us
[10:44:24] <Wilto> Do I count?
[10:44:44] <jzaefferer> open to everyone!
[10:44:53] <eddiemonge> i would say the content looks unimportant enough to have it fall below the main listings
[10:45:12] <Wilto> Collapse that sucka, jzaefferer.
[10:45:15] <jzaefferer> between main content and footer?
[10:45:28] <jzaefferer> collapse?
[10:45:36] <eddiemonge> yes and yes
[10:45:41] <Wilto> Yeah, I’d drop it down there too. Then make the headings toggle their associated content below a certain point.
[10:46:25] <jzaefferer> do you have some resource on combining media queries with additional JS interactions?
[10:46:31] <jzaefferer> so far its all in CSS
[10:47:28] <Wilto> DO I EVER
[10:47:39] <Wilto> I am your resource, sir.
[10:48:05] <Wilto> But the key is: when you have weird interactions going on below a certain breakpoint, keep the associated styles in a max-width media query.
[10:48:25] <Wilto> Look quick, ’cause I’m about to break this link on purpose:
[10:48:26] <Wilto> http://matmarquis.com/nav/
[10:48:56] <Wilto> So, shrink your browser down and open the search toggle, then expand your browser again.
[10:49:23] <Wilto> It drops the open/closed styles above the designated break point, but if you scale it down again: since the class is still in place the style is reapplied.
[10:51:04] <jzaefferer> very nice
[10:51:05] <jzaefferer> thanks
[10:51:48] <Wilto> It’s also a little weird, but setting a data- attribute for the _scripting_ breakpoint makes things a lot more flexible.
[10:53:13] <jzaefferer> can I forward that link, or will it be gone any minute?
[10:54:18] <Wilto> Any minute, unfortunately—but I’ve got a post in the works for Filament.
[10:54:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/QzIN7g
[10:54:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] fix for float value appearing earlier in ua string - John Bender
[11:02:19] <kinblas> Wilto: that search bar is pretty slick ... especially how you swap the search icon onto the form element
[11:03:07] <Wilto> Thanks, man. I’m digging that search pattern, for sure—toddmparker_’s idea, that.
[11:03:26] <kinblas> Visually it looks like the same element but it isn't
[11:03:30] <kinblas> :-)
[11:03:36] <kinblas> mind tricks
[11:03:53] <kinblas> I was trying to figure out how you were killing behaviors with no CSS
[11:03:55] <Wilto> I just gotta learn how to write without three emdashes and two “goddammit”s per sentence, and I’ll be writing up blog posts about some of this stuff.
[11:04:01] <kinblas> that's when I realized it wasn't the same element
[11:04:10] <Wilto> Slight of hand, sir.
[11:04:37] * kinblas looks at Wilto's left hand, while he pick-pockets with the right
[11:04:52] <Wilto> …Who told you about my last career.
[11:06:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/roQEKw
[11:06:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] account for optional 'U;' in iPad ua. The fun continues - John Bender
[11:10:49] <johnbender> kinblas: I've done my UA penance for today
[11:11:00] <johnbender> kinblas: corrected the android issue and the newer ipad ua string
[11:11:27] * kinblas loads visualize
[11:11:52] <kinblas> johnbender: so out of curiosity
[11:12:03] <kinblas> what is this fullboot versus pageload?
[11:12:45] <Wilto> “Optional U?”
[11:12:47] <Wilto> Jesus.
[11:13:10] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/speed/stats/startup.js
[11:13:30] <kinblas> yeah ok I was just lookin' at that
[11:13:55] <johnbender> kinblas: that was my best "guess" really as to when we should be taking those snapshots
[11:14:04] <johnbender> based on our conversation
[11:15:55] <kinblas> johnbender: take a look at /test/tools/page-load-times.js
[11:16:43] <kinblas> johnbender: so the one thing about those perf numbers
[11:17:03] <kinblas> oh nevermind
[11:17:14] <kinblas> I forgot you are timing the page, but the content is already there
[11:17:24] <kinblas> you aren't dynamically loading content
[11:17:28] <johnbender> nope
[11:17:31] <kinblas> I was going to mention something about network latency
[11:17:35] <kinblas> but nevermind
[11:17:44] <johnbender> yah I didn't want to tackle that bit
[11:17:57] <kinblas> johnbender: so I was wondering if we should have 3 numbers
[11:18:09] <johnbender> kinblas: we can have as many numbers as you want
[11:18:14] <johnbender> also I can't find that page
[11:18:15] <johnbender> err
[11:18:17] <johnbender> that js you linked
[11:18:24] <kinblas> load (before create) , enhancement(create to init), and then full-load
[11:18:40] <johnbender> kinblas: is it tools/page-change-time.js ?
[11:18:59] <kinblas> sorry
[11:19:00] <kinblas> http://jquerymobile.com/test/tools/page-change-time.js
[11:19:53] <kinblas> johnbender: the reason, is for example on iPad we see an upward trend
[11:20:02] <kinblas> it would be nice to know if that was enhancement related?
[11:20:14] <kinblas> or was it mostly in the loading/processing before enhancement
[11:21:49] <kinblas> I can't tell if it was due to network latency or what ... actually that can still factor in because the jquerymobile.js is loaded afterwards
[11:22:01] <kinblas> it loads synchronously so we are at the mercy of the network/cache
[11:23:01] <johnbender> kinblas: https://gist.github.com/33b03cc038c8caf46350
[11:24:12] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah that looks about right
[11:24:38] <kinblas> johnbender: is there a way to group the 3 items into a single chart?
[11:24:38] <johnbender> kinblas: you're right, hmmm
[11:24:45] <johnbender> kinblas: which items?
[11:25:21] <kinblas> you know like have a chart that groups full,enhance,pageload for a given day next to each other followed by a gap for the next day with the same 3 things, etc
[11:25:53] <johnbender> kinblas: we've have to create a seperate query, but it's entirely possible
[11:25:54] <kinblas> I've seen charts like that before, not sure if that plugin you use supports that kind of grouping
[11:26:08] <johnbender> kinblas: the data is rather raw for that reason
[11:26:13] <johnbender> I wanted it to be flexible
[11:26:18] <kinblas> +1
[11:26:36] <kinblas> I likes my data raw
[11:26:38] * johnbender was an oracle dba for a while
[11:28:41] <johnbender> kinblas: I'm going to do at least one more pull request today and then dig into the deployment stuff
[11:28:45] <Wilto> Cue: O.D.B.
[11:29:16] <johnbender> Oracle DBA -> .NET/SQL Server consultant -> Ruby dev -> Javascript dev
[11:29:23] <johnbender> progressively getting more hipster
[11:29:56] <toddmparker_> hey all, sorry i was testing devices
[11:29:59] <toddmparker_> forgot to check in
[11:30:03] <toddmparker_> what did i miss?
[11:30:48] <Wilto> Hip-hop references, and jzaefferer inadvertently guilt-tripping me into writing that responsive nav blog post.
[11:31:15] <toddmparker_> i see, good
[11:31:19] <toddmparker_> get writing!
[11:31:22] <Wilto> SIR.
[11:31:27] <toddmparker_> so i've been testing some stuff
[11:31:49] <toddmparker_> this article got me fired up again to try using fonts for icons
[11:31:50] <toddmparker_> http://css-tricks.com/15099-using-fonts-for-icons/
[11:31:57] <toddmparker_> demo page: http://css-tricks.com/examples/IconFont/
[11:32:16] <toddmparker_> hover, after testing all our devices, support isn't great
[11:32:32] <toddmparker_> and when if fails, you get typical missing character boxes and odd characters
[11:32:41] <toddmparker_> my results
[11:32:42] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Fonts-for-icons---support-on-mobile-browsers
[11:33:50] <kinblas> toddmparker_: heh
[11:35:27] <kinblas> toddmparker_: is there really a standard icon font?
[11:35:33] <kinblas> standard icon web-font
[11:35:56] <kinblas> that example just sets a font-family: icons
[11:36:05] <toddmparker_> no, people make their own fonts, then embed them
[11:36:24] <toddmparker_> the font is really just icons mapped to characters
[11:36:30] <kinblas> ok so they need @font-face
[11:36:33] <toddmparker_> great idea and i wanted to do this for 1.0
[11:36:39] <toddmparker_> but support isn't good enough
[11:37:11] <kinblas> toddmparker_: you got my cc to that google guy right? My email has been flakey lately
[11:37:21] <kinblas> so I can't tell and I'm paranoid
[11:37:39] <toddmparker_> yep
[11:37:46] <toddmparker_> thanks for following up
[11:37:54] <toddmparker_> think my tone was a little defensive :)
[11:38:40] <kinblas> toddmparker_: to roman?
[11:38:41] <kinblas> nah
[11:38:45] <toddmparker_> he just wrote back to me
[11:38:47] <Wilto> I just wish you hadn’t flipped my desk before sending it. _Again._
[11:38:47] <toddmparker_> yeah
[11:38:54] <toddmparker_> sorry Wilto
[11:39:02] <toddmparker_> that's what you get for sitting near me
[11:39:13] <kinblas> I didn't get that impression ... but I think he glossed over the asks in the 1st reply
[11:39:37] <kinblas> you were just clarifying
[11:39:59] <kinblas> anyways we'll see if Nicolas replies, he didn't the first time
[11:40:06] <kinblas> we'll see if 2nd time is a charm
[11:41:43] <kinblas> johnbender: so it's things like the Android 2.2 graphs that got me worried about the network latency
[11:41:44] <kinblas> http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/speed/stats/visualize/
[11:41:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: have you had a chance to create and try the docs yet?
[11:41:51] <kinblas> I don't think we got that bad :-)
[11:42:03] <johnbender> kinblas: yah I was wondering about that myself
[11:42:18] <johnbender> kinblas: we're getting down to the point where it really matters too
[11:42:21] <toddmparker_> sorry johnbender - i can now
[11:42:42] <johnbender> kinblas: maybe record the start time at mobileinit?
[11:42:48] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah ... the thing is it *DOES* matter if the device has the jquerymobile.js already in the cache
[11:42:52] <kinblas> it reports lower numbers
[11:42:54] <kinblas> for sure
[11:43:04] <johnbender> kinblas: kk I'll make that change and pus
[11:43:27] <kinblas> so that first load on all devices skews the numbers
[11:44:06] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah mobileinit might be a good place ... but are you trying to measure from doc load to pageready?
[11:44:15] <kinblas> If so then what you have is about right
[11:44:22] <kinblas> though it excludes the loading of core
[11:45:04] <johnbender> kinblas: that was the original idea, but if we want to avoid the network latency issue we have to wait until the js is loaded from the server like you said right?
[11:45:20] <kinblas> ya mon
[11:45:25] <johnbender> kk
[11:45:37] <johnbender> hmm
[11:45:45] <johnbender> I'll add it as another data point
[11:46:03] <johnbender> that way we can get seperate graphs and it is technically a seperate point
[11:46:16] <johnbender> hmm
[11:46:18] <johnbender> nevermind
[11:50:26] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #301: STILL FAILING in 40 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/301/

[11:50:29] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: target the page through the event, simplify the href selection, account for ajax page loads

[11:50:30] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: account for optional 'U;' in iPad ua. The fun continues
[11:51:40] <johnbender> possible merge issue there, I'll take a look
[11:51:46] <toddmparker_> ok, i just emailed my foxed and overflow testing
[11:51:49] <toddmparker_> fixed
[11:52:47] <toddmparker_> i'll post this to the wiki, but formatting will be rough
[11:56:20] <toddmparker_> on the wiki
[11:56:21] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Position:fixed-and-Overflow:-testing
[11:56:28] <toddmparker_> kinblas ^^
[11:57:48] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so with zoom on, most default back to viewport == size of doc?
[11:58:48] <toddmparker_> i think this is just about setting maximum-scale=1.0; user-scalable=0;
[11:59:13] <toddmparker_> yeah, so zoom disabled:
[11:59:14] <toddmparker_> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no" />
[11:59:22] <toddmparker_> (from the test page)
[11:59:35] <kinblas> todddmparker: the 2.2 info is bunched together
[11:59:42] <toddmparker_> not disabled:
[11:59:42] <toddmparker_> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
[11:59:57] <toddmparker_> tough.
[12:00:15] <toddmparker_> ok, fixed
[12:00:18] <kinblas> toddmparker_: heh and you use zoon everywhere :-)
[12:00:27] <toddmparker_> arg
[12:01:15] <toddmparker_> fixed
[12:01:33] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so my one hesitation about ditching the current fixed behavior
[12:01:44] <kinblas> is folks that use navbars today
[12:01:45] <toddmparker_> ...is it's so awesome?
[12:02:00] <kinblas> fixed header/footer I meant
[12:02:03] <toddmparker_> sur
[12:02:04] <kinblas> not fixed positioning
[12:02:05] <toddmparker_> sure
[12:02:15] <kinblas> toddmparker_: that said
[12:02:16] <toddmparker_> we'd need to test this a lot, just seems like a good lead
[12:02:22] <toddmparker_> promising
[12:02:23] <kinblas> we can always give them a plugin for backwards ease
[12:02:27] <toddmparker_> yeah
[12:02:54] <toddmparker_> it would be worth dropping this in and seeing how good we can get it
[12:03:01] <toddmparker_> and where the gotchas are
[12:03:23] <toddmparker_> i know that form elements in a toolbar bust in android with our dynamic re-positioning
[12:03:38] <toddmparker_> it keeps fighting with the on-screen keyboard
[12:03:48] <kinblas> yeah
[12:03:49] <toddmparker_> so maybe this will help
[12:04:01] <kinblas> yeah because we're not moving anythig
[12:04:07] <toddmparker_> right
[12:04:10] <kinblas> the browser does ... if it supports it
[12:04:31] <kinblas> don't get me wrong, I like it ... I just always thought scrolling headers/footers sucked in jqtouch
[12:04:32] <kinblas> :-)
[12:04:35] <sven_franck> kinblas: toddmparker_: sounds like magic?
[12:05:07] <toddmparker_> does jqtouch used position:fixed?
[12:05:26] <toddmparker_> or you just don't like fixed bars in general?
[12:05:34] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I don't think so, headers/footers are inline
[12:05:51] <toddmparker_> so what did that comment mean?
[12:05:56] <kinblas> lol
[12:06:04] <kinblas> I thought if you're going to emulate native
[12:06:08] <kinblas> it should stay fixed
[12:06:12] <kinblas> I now realize it's hard
[12:06:27] <kinblas> but it's hard because the platform doesn't support fixed the way we are used to on desktops
[12:07:03] <toddmparker_> yeah
[12:07:12] <toddmparker_> but now enough do that it's a good option
[12:07:43] <toddmparker_> i like the idea of still have the option to turn on the tap to hide or an auto-hide after X seconds, just combined with this technique
[12:11:18] <kinblas> toddmparker_: hmm now I'm confused
[12:11:28] <kinblas> I thought what you were talking about was losing the fixedheaderfooter stuff and just relying on good ole CSS fixed?
[12:11:55] <toddmparker_> yep
[12:12:18] <Wilto> +1 to that.
[12:12:21] <Wilto> +2, even.
[12:13:01] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so I guess I'm ocnfused about is what you meant by combining that with tap to hide or auto-hide?
[12:13:30] <toddmparker_> well, you could still fade out the bars, even if using position:fixed
[12:13:42] <toddmparker_> right?
[12:13:57] <kinblas> oh yeah, sure
[12:14:20] <kinblas> but that would look odd when at the top of the doc
[12:15:43] <Wilto> We could selectively apply it with a feature test for fixed.
[12:15:54] <Wilto> There’s no way there isn’t one.
[12:16:38] <Wilto> Aaactually.
[12:17:00] <Wilto> When we show/hide, we’d just check if the offset from the top of the document is zero. If so, don’t do anything.
[12:18:03] <toddmparker_> that coud work. think it's like that now?
[12:19:09] <Wilto> No idea. I customized TextMate to point to those files in my project drawer with a little “here there be monsters” flag.
[12:28:09] <Wilto> But if dialogs don’t completely blow up in my face, that could be next on my hit list.
[12:40:37] <johnbender> kinblas: so I'm adding two new data points for that page
[12:40:52] <johnbender> enhancement and pageprocess
[12:41:14] <johnbender> enhancement = pagecreate -> pageinit
[12:41:28] <johnbender> pageprocess = mobileinit -> pageinit
[12:41:50] <johnbender> pageprocess could be pageprocessing
[12:43:47] <kinblas> sounds good
[12:43:54] <johnbender> kewl
[12:44:09] <johnbender> just some testing and I'll push
[12:44:27] <johnbender> bummed I didn't think of that for the original stats :(
[12:44:32] <kinblas> johnbender: so for the missing data points from previous entries
[12:44:56] <kinblas> nevermind ... are you resetting everything?
[12:44:59] <johnbender> nope
[12:45:05] <johnbender> new data points
[12:45:09] <kinblas> ok cool
[12:45:15] <johnbender> we'll keep collecting those too since there is _some_ value there
[12:45:22] <johnbender> just not sure what
[12:45:25] <johnbender> lol
[12:46:39] <kinblas> johnbender: btw did you see the web selenium driver bustage on jenkins?
[12:47:22] <johnbender> kinblas: yessir
[12:47:25] <johnbender> I am aware!
[12:47:49] <kinblas> johnbender: I guess sometime after Thanksgiving you should show me how to reset that stuff so you aren't the only one having to do it all the time
[12:48:12] <johnbender> kinblas: job security :D
[12:48:27] <johnbender> kinblas: I agree though it's always bad to have bottlenecks
[12:48:37] <kinblas> heh ... ok if you're good with always dealing with it
[12:48:46] <johnbender> and it's not guaranteed that i'm "doing it right" either so its good to get others involved
[12:49:17] <toddmparker_> ok johnbender - do you still need me to test the docs message stuff?
[12:50:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I would just take a gander and see if you spot anything wrong
[12:50:19] <toddmparker_> ok. can you remind me what to do? sorry
[12:50:19] <johnbender> I think we have it sorted fairly well
[12:50:28] <johnbender> commands from the root:
[12:50:32] <johnbender> make docs
[12:50:48] <johnbender> unzip compiled/jquery.mobile.docs.zip
[12:50:56] <johnbender> open jquery.mobile/index.html
[12:51:04] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[12:51:09] <toddmparker_> so this is in master?
[12:51:13] <johnbender> yessir
[12:51:18] <toddmparker_> ok
[12:51:25] <johnbender> I pulled in eddie's changes and make some quick tweeks
[12:51:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: actually
[12:51:37] <toddmparker_> nice
[12:51:42] <toddmparker_> yeesssss
[12:51:56] <johnbender> I meant to ask, which browsers had ajax working with the file protocol?
[12:52:10] <johnbender> I set it up to work with page changes but I need to double check it
[12:52:36] <johnbender> i think it said in the ticket but none of those worked for me
[12:54:24] <johnbender> and by none of those I mean "firefox" :P
[12:55:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/wd-p3Q

[12:55:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3139 from agcolom/patch-38 - Todd Parker
[12:58:07] <toddmparker_> johnbender: where does the zip go?
[12:58:21] <johnbender> compiled/
[13:02:25] <toddmparker_> ok, looks good
[13:02:37] <toddmparker_> so you guys got this working in chrome huh?
[13:02:43] <toddmparker_> windows chrome too?
[13:03:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I did not test in windows chrome. I have to be honest with you there
[13:03:13] <toddmparker_> the reason i ask is that message says it may not work in some browsers, such as chrome
[13:03:32] <toddmparker_> is there a browser we know this won't work in?
[13:03:34] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it doesn't work in chromium, ajax
[13:03:44] <toddmparker_> or we can just keep it vague
[13:03:51] <johnbender> +1
[13:03:59] <johnbender> ass covering
[13:04:04] <johnbender> it's what we do
[13:04:04] <toddmparker_> mind vaguifying?
[13:04:25] <toddmparker_> we need to remember to add some info to that wiki page
[13:04:42] <toddmparker_> looks great.
[13:04:50] <toddmparker_> after that text change, lock and load
[13:05:09] <toddmparker_> big improvement
[13:05:11] <Wilto> “Sometimes in life some things don’t work.” Vague++
[13:05:20] <toddmparker_> like it
[13:06:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll just take out the chrome reference
[13:06:09] <toddmparker_> yep
[13:10:55] <toddmparker_> guys - what's your take on this issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3136
[13:10:56] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3136 on jquery-mobile, reported by kirk911 (6h, 37m ago): preventDefault does not prevent history change during pagebeforechange event
[13:19:36] <kinblas> toddmparker: all of that happens *BEFORE* changePage() gets called I think ... the browser has already decremented it's history stack pointer before it triggers the hashchange
[13:23:12] <sven_franck> kinblas: I was sitting on something similar today. Only thing that worked for me was to prevent the hashChange from firing.
[13:23:49] <kinblas> sven_franck: you can't do that if they've hit the back button
[13:24:18] <kinblas> if you don't process, the changePage request, our notion of where we are in the stack will be out of sync with the browser
[13:24:26] <sven_franck> kinblas: similar...
[13:28:45] <johnbender> ah which reminds me
[13:29:19] <johnbender> kinblas: it seems like everyone is finding he hashchange is slow, are they talking about the event that's triggered by the browser?
[13:29:33] <johnbender> sven_franck: ^
[13:30:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I don't think my key is on the cdn server so we'll have to have dan or eddie push the new zip
[13:30:28] <kinblas> johnbender: sven_franck: depends on the browser
[13:30:32] <toddmparker_> doesn't look like either is around, huh?
[13:30:39] <toddmparker_> mind sending a quick email?
[13:30:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: negatory :(
[13:30:44] <johnbender> not at all
[13:30:45] <kinblas> most browsers fire a hashchange event, other times, it's a polling timer via our hashchange plugin
[13:30:47] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: I'm here
[13:30:58] <toddmparker_> hey sven_franck
[13:31:15] <toddmparker_> we were looking for danheberden or eddiemonge
[13:31:21] <sven_franck> ok
[13:31:23] <johnbender> kinblas: so the polling should be faster than 300ms eh?
[13:31:42] <kinblas> johnbender: well, the idea is not to tax the cpu too much
[13:31:54] <kinblas> too much polling wears the battery down
[13:31:55] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin - are you around tomorrow?
[13:32:04] <gseguin> yes
[13:32:08] <toddmparker_> cool
[13:32:08] <johnbender> kinblas: that would be a fun benchmark
[13:32:26] <gseguin> what is it about? did I just volonteer for something?
[13:32:33] <toddmparker_> i might want to see if you can whip up a branch with toolbars using fixed: CSS
[13:32:33] <kinblas> heh
[13:32:35] <toddmparker_> heh
[13:33:06] <toddmparker_> what else is on your plate?
[13:33:30] <toddmparker_> if you're busy, maybe garann would want to tinker with this
[13:33:38] <gseguin> I was looking into making our code AMD modules and use RequireJS as our build system
[13:33:44] * johnbender loves that we have so much help
[13:33:45] <toddmparker_> i just need this wired in so i can do more testing
[13:33:52] <toddmparker_> yeah johnbender
[13:34:08] <gseguin> don't know how much of a priority that is though
[13:34:10] <toddmparker_> ok gseguin - that seems more important
[13:34:19] <toddmparker_> paves the way for the download builder, right?
[13:34:27] <gseguin> yes indeed
[13:34:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/_NpCqg
[13:34:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] record enhancement time and pageprocessing, both of which ignore the network load time of the jqm js - John Bender
[13:34:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] remove chrome ref - John Bender
[13:34:37] <toddmparker_> think that's importnat
[13:34:52] <gseguin> allows you to declare dependencies
[13:34:58] <toddmparker_> cool
[13:35:10] <toddmparker_> guess we need to get that dependency map worked out too
[13:35:11] <gseguin> I actually found a project on github we could leverage
[13:35:17] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[13:35:33] * gseguin looks for it
[13:37:10] <gseguin> there it is: https://github.com/arian/amd-packager-php
[13:37:36] <gseguin> Someone can start looking at that
[13:38:19] <gseguin> the unfortunate thing is that it still has a dependency on PHP :(
[13:38:50] <gseguin> I was dreaming of a NodeJS service that could do that  but haven't wrapped my head around it
[13:39:12] <gseguin> toddmparker_: are you in tomorrow?
[13:39:22] <toddmparker_> yup gseguin
[13:39:35] <eddiemonge> where are docs getting pushed to?
[13:39:46] <toddmparker_> hey eddiemonge
[13:39:52] <gseguin> ok I'll ping you in the morning to figure out what I should be spending time on
[13:39:54] <johnbender> eddiemonge: it looked to me like the zip gets push to the cdn in the deploy target
[13:39:55] <garann> toddmparker_: you need someone to do something with fixed CSS?
[13:40:00] <toddmparker_> they should replace the ones up on the cdn
[13:40:02] <eddiemonge> right
[13:40:09] <toddmparker_> yeah that
[13:40:11] <toddmparker_> hey garann
[13:40:19] <johnbender> eddiemonge: without a full deploy though
[13:40:21] <johnbender> just scp the zip
[13:40:23] <toddmparker_> what are you looking at right now?
[13:40:24] <johnbender> of the docs
[13:40:32] <garann> toddmparker_: not a thing
[13:40:39] <toddmparker_> cool, fun project then
[13:40:56] <toddmparker_> based on my initial research, I'm feeling pretty good about position:fixed support
[13:41:25] <toddmparker_> I'd like to make a branch where we can play around with modding the fixed toolbar script
[13:41:35] <toddmparker_> to use position fixed CSS instead
[13:41:44] <garann> ah, cool
[13:41:55] <toddmparker_> once that's in, i can do more testing to see how it goes
[13:42:01] <eddiemonge> replace the jqmdocs.js or the whole package?
[13:42:14] <eddiemonge> or should docs get added to the /latest/ folder?
[13:42:22] <toddmparker_> i need to probably make some test pages with different elements in the toolbars - forms, buttons, etc. to make sure those work ok too
[13:42:26] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I was thinking we could just scp a new version of the zip
[13:42:33] <johnbender> unless people are downloading it some other way
[13:43:20] <eddiemonge> to /1.0/?
[13:44:01] <toddmparker_> garann - if the initial tests look good, we can think about whether a support test could be added for this and maybe even an option to use the current dynamic re-positioning as a polyfill
[13:44:14] <johnbender> eddiemonge: where do people download the zip from now
[13:44:17] <toddmparker_> but the first step is to just wire this this in place of the JS toolbar logic
[13:44:22] <johnbender> I'm not sure how to answer your questions other than how I did
[13:44:31] <eddiemonge> i dont know. i dont even know if we've published a link to them
[13:44:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[13:44:53] <toddmparker_> what's the Q?
[13:45:00] <toddmparker_> whether this should replace 1.0?
[13:45:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: where are people downloading the docs from, or are they supposed to build them for themselves from the repo?
[13:45:20] <garann> toddmparker_: cool, that sounds straight-forward
[13:45:27] <toddmparker_> the zip is linked from the release
[13:45:58] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/11/16/announcing-jquery-mobile-1-0/
[13:46:05] <toddmparker_> "download zip" link near the top
[13:46:26] <toddmparker_> we just need to make sure we're not changing the library code at all.
[13:46:46] <toddmparker_> i.e. no changes from release day should be in the JS
[13:47:12] <eddiemonge> have there been any changes to the docs since then that shouldnt be in there?
[13:47:45] <toddmparker_> nah, that's ok anyway
[13:47:57] <toddmparker_> just don't want the actual mobile 1.0 code to change
[13:48:05] <johnbender> toddmparker_: eddiemonge: we can branch from the tag and just cherrypick the commits we made to address the issues
[13:48:11] <johnbender> then rebuild the zip
[13:48:22] <toddmparker_> docs changes are prolly fine to include, they aren't a big deal
[13:48:22] <eddiemonge> werent the only changes in jqmdocs.js?
[13:48:28] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yes
[13:48:35] <toddmparker_> cool
[13:48:42] <eddiemonge> ok then i can rebuild using only that file
[13:48:51] <johnbender> but doing a `make docs` will include the latest js eh?
[13:48:57] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ah
[13:49:11] <johnbender> fair enough
[13:49:53] <eddiemonge> im going to download https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/zipball/1.0 , copy in the current jqmdocs.js and run make deploy from that, with only the zip file being generated
[13:50:18] <johnbender> eddiemonge: make sure to give it a good test just in case

[14:24:10] <eddiemonge> that can be closed
[14:24:32] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: is this bug satisfied? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3113
[14:24:33] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3113 on jquery-mobile, reported by eddiemonge (3d, 19h ago): Docs without a Server don't work (Chrome)
[14:24:53] <toddmparker_> think so, just checking now!
[14:25:01] <johnbender> eddiemonge: on the second one I was waiting until we deployed the zip
[14:25:40] <johnbender> eddiemonge: what does 3115 address?
[14:25:59] <eddiemonge> the same thing we fixed in the jqmdocs with the links
[14:26:25] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah that definitely can be closed
[14:26:33] <johnbender> it only addresses "../../" links :/
[14:26:47] <toddmparker_> seems to work great guys
[14:26:55] <eddiemonge> good to push then?
[14:27:03] <toddmparker_> the only think i realize is that we shut off ajax nav, right?
[14:27:22] <toddmparker_> guess we can explain all that on the wiki page
[14:27:26] <eddiemonge> there is a difference between that zip and the one that is up there though: there isnt a separate docs.zip in it anymore
[14:27:39] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: its only shut off if it isnt supported
[14:27:57] <toddmparker_> ok, so if i drop this into a web server, ajax is on and no message?
[14:28:04] <eddiemonge> yup
[14:28:09] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[14:28:15] <toddmparker_> go for it
[14:28:25] <toddmparker_> looks great. so much more useful
[14:28:32] <TehShrike|Work> Is it even supported for new elements to be created and styled by jqm after the page is initialized?
[14:29:00] <toddmparker_> sure, you can use create to enhance new markup added
[14:29:02] <TehShrike|Work> A lot of people are trying to do it, one of them me, but the docs aren't really any help
[14:29:07] <toddmparker_> or call the plugins directly
[14:29:11] <TehShrike|Work> create() is the function to be used?
[14:29:19] <TehShrike|Work> You're speaking of using .button() or something?
[14:29:44] <toddmparker_> this is a good docs page to point people to: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-scripting.html
[14:30:10] <toddmparker_> See "Enhancing new markup" halfway down
[14:30:54] <TehShrike|Work> That looks highly relevant!
[14:32:00] <johnbender> so if anyone is interested
[14:32:11] <johnbender> the ci server saw an upgrade to firefox 8 that wasn't my doing
[14:32:17] <johnbender> which honestly makes me nervous
[14:33:48] <Wilto> Like, Skynet-nervous?
[14:34:04] <toddmparker_> does FF auto-update now?
[14:34:39] <toddmparker_> soooo...who wants to be the other Bada test device holder? kinblas, johnbender or gseguin
[14:34:58] <Wilto> I kind of hope it does.
[14:35:08] <gseguin> is bada short for bad ass ?
[14:36:10] <gseguin> joking aside it would make more sense that full time folks get it
[14:36:31] <eddiemonge> ok http://code.jquery.com/mobile/1.0/jquery.mobile-1.0.zip will be refreshed shortly. the file is on the cdn
[14:39:17] <toddmparker_> thanks eddiemonge and johnbender for gettignthe zip updated. makes me feel a million times better about the 1.0 release.
[14:39:36] <toddmparker_> so kinblas or johnbender - who's the lucky fella?
[14:40:10] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I think bender only has 2 devices
[14:40:11] <kinblas> :-D
[14:40:22] <kinblas> an android and a wp7
[14:40:58] <toddmparker_> he wins!
[14:44:01] <eddiemonge> or loses depending on how you look at it
[14:44:07] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I'm "device lite"
[14:47:10] <toddmparker_> you got it buddy
[15:07:10] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #303: STILL FAILING in 4.2 sec: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/303/
[15:07:10] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: record enhancement time and pageprocessing, both of which ignore the network load time of the jqm js
[15:07:11] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * john.m.bender: remove chrome ref
[15:22:03] <toddmparker_> ok, heading home
[15:22:10] <toddmparker_> talk to you guys later
[15:22:50] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
