[08:54:23] <johnbender> scottjehl: Wilto: _|Nix|_: uGoMobi: agcolom: did you guys see my basecamp post (_|Nix|_ excluded) about cleaning up the branches?
[08:54:43] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yes
[08:59:12] <uGoMobi> johnbender: to be clear... there are no branches that i want reserved
[09:12:33] <uGoMobi> Wilto: are you here?
[09:48:28] <Wilto> I am now.
[09:48:29] <bot-t> (82 hours 30 mins ago) <matjas> tell Wilto oh my gawd Enter The Magical Mystery Chambers is amazing â€” thanks!
[10:20:45] <johnbender> uGoMobi: can you respond with that so others know
[10:20:50] <johnbender> also I need the bump in their mailboxes :D
[10:28:57] <uGoMobi> Wilto: reason why I ask is that inline-block causing flip toggle, slider and controlgroup to break when used in header/footer
[10:43:32] <johnbender> ?tell toddmparker when we deploy the next release I'll need at least a day heads up to make sure everything works as expected
[10:43:38] <johnbender> gah
[10:43:41] <johnbender> Wilto:
[10:43:44] <johnbender> ^
[10:43:50] <johnbender> can you tell todd if you talk to him
[10:43:57] <gseguin> Wilto is the new bot-t
[10:53:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: do you have any branches that we shouldn't delete?
[11:02:23] <johnbender> gseguin: any branches that we shouldn't delete?
[11:02:40] * gseguin re-checks
[11:03:03] <johnbender> gseguin: can you respond in the negative if there aren't so that it gets bumped in peoples mailboxes :D
[11:03:06] <johnbender> uGoMobi: ^
[11:03:09] <johnbender> if you haven't alread
[11:03:47] <gseguin> johnbender: none, will reply to the BC thread
[11:03:54] <johnbender> thanks
[11:04:11] <uGoMobi> johnbender: sure
[11:04:31] <gseguin> I see a 1.2 branch
[11:04:38] <gseguin> when was that created ?
[11:04:45] <johnbender> gseguin: we can get rid of that
[11:04:50] <gseguin> ok
[11:04:51] <johnbender> it was for the interim before the 1.1 release
[11:04:54] <johnbender> so we could continue work
[11:05:02] <johnbender> but preserve master for stability
[11:05:11] <johnbender> or at least that's what I recall
[12:23:07] <agcolom> johnbender: Hi, I do not use any branches other than the ones you have mentioned in your email
[12:28:49] <agcolom> johnbender: actually I only use 1.1-stable and master
[12:32:19] <agcolom> who's the KING (or master ;-) ) of events? (I need details of all events associated with "dialog" (I guess there must be an event fired when it gets open and one when it gets closed?)... this is for the new docs project (deadline is the jQuery conference at the end of the month) Thx
[12:48:12] <johnbender> agcolom: can you post that to the thread so others know
[12:48:13] <johnbender> sorry
[12:48:23] <johnbender> just want to make sure that everyone knows that I'm going to be deleting a ton of branches
[12:52:55] <agcolom> johnbender: sure, will do now...
[12:53:02] <johnbender> thanks!
[12:53:28] <johnbender> agcolom: it also has the additional benefit of exhonerating me of wrong doing when I delete something people needed if everyone checks in :D
[12:54:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: gabriel do you have any branches you want left alone?
[12:55:36] <agcolom> johnbender: done: Yes you are absolutely right.
[12:56:09] <agcolom> johnbender: do you know who I should ask for all the deep details of dialog?
[12:56:28] <johnbender> agcolom: probably me or gseguin
[12:56:56] <agcolom> ok cool. Is it best to ask on IRC or in an email on basecamp?
[12:58:24] <johnbender> agcolom: do you have a big set of questions ready to roll? In which case basecamp would be good for getting it in front of gseguin and I
[12:58:54] <johnbender> if we may need to reference parts of the conversation later then BC would be good to
[12:58:59] <johnbender> ie, really complex discussions
[13:03:51] <agcolom> I have a few, so will compile a list this evening and post it there.... nothing complex I think it's just a matter of getting everything correct for the new widget docs (not sure what the name of that project is actually ;-) ) all with XML and XSLT ;-) And as I am testing things to double check, I have also found one thing that I cannot get to work... Maybe because I am not doing ti right...
[13:06:08] <johnbender> agcolom: yah sounds like a basecamp post would be good and, depending, a bug :P
[13:06:17] <johnbender> gseguin: you around?
[13:23:05] <gseguin> now I am
[13:23:11] <gseguin> 'sup?
[13:23:41] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[13:47:20] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm going merge my build refactor soon
[13:47:25] <johnbender> just a heads up in case you hear about build issue
[13:47:27] <johnbender> *issues
[13:47:31] <johnbender> I've checked everything I can think to check
[13:47:33] <johnbender> diffs and such
[13:47:34] <gseguin> ok
[13:47:36] <johnbender> and it should be fine
[13:48:20] <gseguin> Tomorrow I need to finish fixing the builder ui to support nested directories in our source tree
[13:48:40] <gseguin> then I'll do the code organization we talked about last week
[13:50:16] <agcolom> johnbender, gseguin, I have posted a message on basecamp, with a few questions on dialog. Would be great if you could take a look when you have time. (no rush as I am going to bed soon, and I'll have work all day tomorrow, so will not be able to look at it for about 22h )
[13:50:48] <gseguin> thanks agcolom, will try to look at that tonight
[13:51:32] <agcolom> Thank you :-) (Btw it was mother's day in France last sunday! Hope you didn't forget ;-)
[13:52:40] <gseguin> oh sh...!
[13:52:52] <gseguin> thanks!
[13:56:13] <agcolom> no prob. I should have thought the info didn't travel that far! Luckily I was outside a flower shop on saturday in Paris and there was a big sign, otherwise would have missed it too! it was only 2 days ago so not so bad... Just checked Father's day is 17th June
[13:56:47] <gseguin> :)
[14:11:43] <agcolom> toddparker: Hi, I had a meeting with Richard yesterday... I'm all setup and have started on the 1st widget...

[14:30:32] <agcolom> Goodnight everyone...
[14:54:18] <toddparker> hi all
[14:54:34] <toddparker> our internet has been out since yesterday at the office so IRC wan't working for me
[14:54:38] <toddparker> what did I miss?
[14:54:57] <toddparker> agcolom: great to hear you've already started on the new XML docs.
[14:55:06] <toddparker> might be a good student project, huh?
[15:14:42] <agcolom> Toddparker, yes, but all students have disappeared for the summer and it looks like it's going to be my project ;-) oh well, the good thing it it makes me go all over the docs in great detail and I have already picked a few things that need clarifying...
[15:20:03] <agcolom> And it's nice to get back into XSLT :-)
[15:24:38] <toddparker> Cool.
[15:24:45] <toddparker> We have 2 interns here that can help out too
[15:24:50] <toddparker> once you're set up
[15:25:05] <toddparker> but they will be better at copy/paste
[15:25:10] <toddparker> while you will actually read and re-write
[15:25:20] <agcolom> That sounds excellent!
[15:25:31] <toddparker> so we can divide and conquer
[15:25:59] <agcolom> Perfect. Because it seems the deadline is the jQuery conference!!!!
[15:26:34] <agcolom> Do you know how much we need to have completed by then?
[15:27:08] <agcolom> sorry I'm not sure that was proper English !
[15:30:30] <agcolom> ok, bedtime here.... Goodnight again every one...
