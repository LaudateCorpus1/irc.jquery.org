[08:03:08] <toddmparker_> gah. i'm off the iOS betas
[08:03:23] <toddmparker_> the 5 process was bad on my primary phone
[08:03:44] <toddmparker_> tho i just bought a 4s so maybe i can use my old 4 as the 5.1 beta phone
[08:04:00] <toddmparker_> johnbender - this pull looks good: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3188
[08:04:01] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eugenb1 (8h, 26m ago): Slider: use also option text as title #2759
[08:05:05] <Wilto> “Early Morning Technical Difficulties” is both the reason I’m only joining you guys now, and the name of my upcoming [terrible] indie-rock band.
[08:06:26] <Wilto> Hi guys.
[08:50:48] <gseguin> Good morning
[11:17:49] <gseguin> is it really quiet today or is it IRCCloud missing most of it?
[11:42:47] <sven_franck> gseguin: enjoy the silence :-)
[12:46:16] <gseguin> heh :)
[13:11:45] <kinblas> gseguin: FYI, I'm splitting my time the next couple of weeks like you are doing.
[13:11:45] <bot-t> (17 hours 20 mins ago) <johnbender> tell kinblas http://www.engadget.com/2011/11/28/ios-5-1-beta-seeded-to-developers/
[13:12:30] <gseguin> oh ok and bender's on vacation
[13:12:47] <gseguin> hence the low traffic on the channel
[13:13:43] <kinblas> gseguin: yup
[13:14:05] <kinblas> I imagine todd and wilto are catching up on other things too
[13:15:04] <kinblas> gseguin: btw, can you remind me how to leave a msg with bot-t for someone? Is there like a bot-t help that shows the commands?
[13:15:40] <gseguin> use ?tell
[13:15:40] <bot-t> gseguin, Syntax: tell <nick> <message>
[13:15:56] <gseguin> kinblas: ^
[13:16:04] <gseguin> bot-t: thank you

[13:17:18] <gseguin> I love chatting with bot-t, I feel like I live in the future
[13:36:41] <Wilto> Hey hi whatup.
[13:36:50] <Wilto> Just checking in here occasionally.
[13:39:28] <Wilto> What are the haps, kinblas?
[13:39:57] <kinblas> Wilto: not much today, just replied to sergey regarding perf stuff
[13:40:14] <kinblas> Wilto: you play with any of those transition samples?
[13:41:00] <Wilto> I have not, no. Been pulled in nineteen directions the past couple of days—that’s why there’s been so much radio silence this week, for my part.
[13:44:59] <Wilto> And once more unto the breach. Shoot an email my way if anything should come up, yeah?
[14:25:29] <toddmparker_> hey kinblas
[14:25:34] <toddmparker_> yeah, been crazy
[14:25:35] <kinblas> yo
[14:25:48] <toddmparker_> yo kinblas
[14:26:14] <toddmparker_> i've been tinkering around with a few things, been pulling Wilto in
[14:26:19] <kinblas> uh huh
[14:26:45] <toddmparker_> my thought is that if you can keep going on understanding the root cause of blinks that is still a godd direction
[14:26:55] <toddmparker_> sicne youv'e dug in
[14:26:57] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah, will do
[14:27:11] <kinblas> I'm hoping to do some jqm stuff tomorrow
[14:27:18] <toddmparker_> there are a few areas i'm trying to investigate
[14:27:21] <kinblas> been trying to ramp up on some stuff internally
[14:27:21] <toddmparker_> cool
[14:27:36] <kinblas> what areas?
[14:27:56] <toddmparker_> garann is going to look at trying to use position:fixed for toolbars in a branch for us to try out
[14:28:10] <kinblas> great!
[14:28:40] <toddmparker_> once you have a handle on transitions, i want to look at re-vamping that system. probably package the switch away form keyframes as part of it if we can
[14:28:59] <kinblas> you mean switch to transitions?
[14:29:09] <toddmparker_> right now, i'm focusing on thinking about how to make some small tools that will let people do cool stuff
[14:29:14] <toddmparker_> yeap
[14:29:18] <Wilto> Oh, awesome.
[14:29:21] <kinblas> oooh tools ... cool!
[14:29:52] <kinblas> toddmparker_: regarding transitions, it would be good to find out from the different browser vendors what their plans are for keyframe animations
[14:30:15] <kinblas> like I said transitions are almost everywhere, but in terms of interacting with them, they suck
[14:30:31] <kinblas> they are more for the fire and forget-a-bout-it variety
[14:31:16] <kinblas> ... well, they suck because our transitions are expressed via CSS, so we don't necessarily know what properties are being animated
[14:31:32] <kinblas> but if we fired them ourselves with code, it might be a different story
[14:31:48] <kinblas> but we all know coding transitions isn't as friendly as expressing them in CSS
[14:31:49] <toddmparker_> so wilto and i are looking at a few related things: dialog markup refactor, prototyping a popup widget based on that pull we saw a while ago, and leveraging the nav stuff to make ajax links/includes work
[14:32:09] <kinblas> oooh great!
[14:32:16] <kinblas> baby step towards tablet
[14:32:25] <toddmparker_> yeap, that's the idea
[14:32:28] <kinblas> I likey ... re-useable pattern
[14:32:39] <toddmparker_> want your input on that stuff, have some notes
[14:32:43] <kinblas> re-useable ... re-purposeful
[14:33:08] <toddmparker_> with this you can have a link with a target which can be anything on the page
[14:33:09] <kinblas> toddmparker_: sure if you've got stuff to look at or play with send 'em
[14:33:41] <toddmparker_> kk, Wilto started a prototype just to illustrate the API, needs some fixin
[14:33:54] <toddmparker_> we're going to put up a branch with all these things in it
[14:33:55] <kinblas> toddmparker_: as part of that I'd like to decouple the nav history and hash setting
[14:34:05] <toddmparker_> because we need to work out how they play together
[14:34:08] <toddmparker_> then we can break it up
[14:34:15] <kinblas> ok
[14:34:15] <toddmparker_> perfect
[14:34:17] <kinblas> sounds good
[14:34:39] <toddmparker_> i need a re-usable way to say "track this in the history" for back button support
[14:34:56] <toddmparker_> like what we do for dialogs, but other widgets may need that
[14:35:40] <toddmparker_> for example, i open a popup (in-page overlay), i want the back button to close it
[14:36:03] <Wilto> Checkin’ in.
[14:36:42] <toddmparker_> Links - create an ajax include pattern to do cool stuff (make a tab control, photo viewer) when clicked or at a width breakpoint (to lazy load in content)
[14:36:42] <toddmparker_> <a href="food.html" data-include="replace" data-fragment=".bq" data-target=".quote" data-breakpoint="800">I’m a link.</a>
[14:37:13] <toddmparker_> href	- source of content: local (#foo) or external page (foo.html)
[14:37:13] <toddmparker_> data-include - method for the link action "append", "prepend", "replace", "before", "after" or rel="append | prepend | etc."
[14:37:13] <toddmparker_> data-target - where the content should go, can be a jQuery selector
[14:37:13] <toddmparker_> data-fragment - for external page, a selector to say what content you want to grab
[14:37:13] <toddmparker_> data-breakpoint - a min-width to auto-execute the link = load in this as an include on larger displays
[14:37:28] <toddmparker_> ^^ needs refinement, but i hope this gets the idea across
[14:37:59] <toddmparker_> with this, i can have a link populate a part of the page, either by fetching in content or using local markup
[14:38:06] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ah, so the data-breakpoint is just an optional include
[14:38:22] <toddmparker_> yeah, all of it is. need to map it all out
[14:38:24] <kinblas> I remember scott showing me that from someone before
[14:38:58] <kinblas> ... that is, someone had a library for "include links"
[14:39:00] <toddmparker_> at the most basic, you can have a link and you can set the data-target to say where the content goes when clicked (or if the breakpoint hits)
[14:39:13] <toddmparker_> yeah, same idea but trying to work it out more
[14:39:25] <kinblas> if the breakpoint is hit, it loads it at target?
[14:39:28] <kinblas> or in place?
[14:39:39] <kinblas> the example scott showed me was "in-place"
[14:39:51] <toddmparker_> the data-fragment lets you say "grab this chunk of content in an external page"
[14:40:03] <toddmparker_> can be either
[14:40:27] <kinblas> toddmparker_: one usecase to consider is that someone may have multiple links to the same target, what happens if they all have the same or overlapping breakpoints?
[14:40:28] <toddmparker_> we can have it so if a target isn't set, the target is assumed to the be link
[14:40:34] <kinblas> do they all get loaded into target?
[14:40:43] <toddmparker_> sheesh
[14:40:48] <Wilto> kinblas: You could use append/before/after/etc.
[14:40:51] <toddmparker_> gotta think about that
[14:40:53] <Wilto> And just keep piling ’em in there.
[14:41:01] <kinblas> toddmparker_: you know someone's gonna do that :-)
[14:41:03] <Wilto> Or replace if the intention is to replace the existing content.
[14:41:16] <kinblas> Wilto: right
[14:41:34] <toddmparker_> yeah. there will be a data-attr (called include, but maybe method is better) to specify  "append", "prepend", "replace", "before", "after" etc.
[14:41:55] <toddmparker_> by just mixing and matching, you can do quite a lot
[14:42:50] <toddmparker_> i can build a list that is drillable by just having a listview with links that have a target of the listview's ID
[14:43:47] <toddmparker_> or i can have a minimal smartphone page and lazy load in other panels or nav at wider breakpoints
[14:44:09] <Wilto> It’s a cool little pattern. And I can say that because it was almost entirely Scott’s idea.
[14:44:18] <toddmparker_> getting the API just right is key, but if we keep it clean and simple, it's super powerful when combines with some CSS media queries
[14:44:32] <toddmparker_> then we have the little in-page popups
[14:44:54] <kinblas> I likey ... so where is it? :-)
[14:45:24] <toddmparker_> i was playing with that last night and it's so easy to make a menu (listview in a popup), a lightbox (image in a popup), login form, info bubble/tooltip, etc.
[14:45:35] <Wilto> In a messy pile, in my /sites folder.
[14:45:40] <kinblas> lol
[14:45:42] <Wilto> (Workin’ on it.)
[14:45:50] <toddmparker_> combine that with the ajax link stuff and you can populate the popups with external content = hotness
[14:46:08] <kinblas> toddmparker_: btw, for the drillable menu, you meant like a tree-widget?
[14:46:25] <kinblas> toddmparker_: wouldn't the target have to be some UL under the listitem link you just clicked?
[14:46:33] <toddmparker_> i like the idea of focusing on making little tools and behaviors you can mix together
[14:46:51] <toddmparker_> i meant an ipod-esque drill menu
[14:46:59] <kinblas> toddmparker_: schwing ... now you're talkin' my language
[14:47:18] <kinblas> before I worked on jqm I was workin on a set of re-useable UI pattern components
[14:47:19] <toddmparker_> ideally, we'd support any page transition for these link behaviors
[14:47:29] <kinblas> that were so easy to throw together to make complex widgets
[14:47:45] <toddmparker_> yeah? anything we should look at?
[14:47:59] <kinblas> I think I showed it to you guys back in August 2010
[14:48:08] <kinblas> when we were doin' phone calls :-)
[14:48:24] <toddmparker_> riiight
[14:48:33] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'll try to dig it up and push it somewhere public
[14:48:38] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[14:48:51] <toddmparker_> i'll refine this stuff and post it to the 1.next page and email
[14:49:09] <toddmparker_> mat is working on a branch for us to organize this stuff and make demos
[14:49:09] <kinblas> great! I'm excited about these little plugins/tools
[14:49:13] <toddmparker_> me too
[14:49:19] <kinblas> allows folks to pick and choose
[14:49:22] <kinblas> things they want/like
[14:49:24] <toddmparker_> think about others that we could abstract
[14:49:27] <toddmparker_> yeah
[14:49:42] <toddmparker_> and having things that don't have a prescrive UI at all
[14:49:50] <kinblas> right
[14:50:05] <toddmparker_> you build what you want, these juse add all this ajax or animation magic
[14:50:28] <toddmparker_> i've been trying to figure out how to apply a similar idea for the collapsible behavior
[14:50:44] <kinblas> heh that was one of the components I had
[14:50:51] <kinblas> you split them into 2 components
[14:51:00] <toddmparker_> i.e. have a link that can have a target when you click the link it toggles the expand/collapse
[14:51:20] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so if you break down tabs, accordions, disclosure widgets in general
[14:51:22] <toddmparker_> the collapsible/accordion
[14:51:30] <toddmparker_> right
[14:51:36] <kinblas> they can all be made with 2 components
[14:51:40] <toddmparker_> exactly
[14:51:57] <kinblas> one that manages  a set of "push buttons" ... think old school stereo pop-up buttons ...
[14:52:02] <kinblas> only one can be down/active
[14:52:12] <kinblas> and then a set of panels where only one can be shown
[14:52:15] <toddmparker_> the widgets we have are fine, but what if i want to have a button in my header that, when clicked shows a menu - easy with this tool
[14:52:17] <kinblas> ... transitions can vary
[14:52:31] <toddmparker_> right. either you collapse siblings or not
[14:52:57] <kinblas> toddmparker_: and if you break them up that way you can have more than one set of buttons control/affect the same set of panels
[14:53:15] <toddmparker_> a big part of the power of this stuff will be in allowing these to inherit from a parent or have different behavior when in a parent
[14:53:31] <toddmparker_> right
[14:53:52] <toddmparker_> easy to make a tab, for example
[14:53:56] <kinblas> right
[14:55:02] <toddmparker_> in our world, is that just a grouped set of link buttons/navbar with a target on the wrapper that points to what panel needs to be updated
[14:56:17] <toddmparker_> each link has an href="#foo" which is the content to be shown
[14:56:56] <toddmparker_> for a tab, there is the question of whether you move stuff in the DOM to show it like i described
[14:59:55] <kinblas> right
[15:02:02] <toddmparker_> we need to draw a line between writing JS in html
[15:02:17] <toddmparker_> but i think some of these would be timesavers, even if you were a scripter
[15:04:18] <toddmparker_> anyway, all good stuff to thinka bout
[15:04:34] <toddmparker_> once we get these demos up, i'm sure you will have a lot of cool ideas
[15:08:38] <toddmparker_> kinblas: is there a way to prevent hijaxing individual links?
[15:08:43] <toddmparker_> or all on a page?
[15:09:11] <kinblas> toddmparker_: rel=external
[15:09:16] <kinblas> data-ajax="false"
[15:09:25] <toddmparker_> heh
[15:09:26] <toddmparker_> der
[15:09:27] <kinblas> toddmparker_: do you mean for a given jQM page?
[15:09:44] <kinblas> toddmparker_: that's what that bug I filed last week was about
[15:09:55] <kinblas> being able to mark a container to say don't touch the links in this container
[15:10:00] <toddmparker_> right now, our ajax include doesn't play nice with the global nav stuff
[15:10:07] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:10:25] <toddmparker_> this is just a temporary thing data-ajax should work
[15:10:53] <toddmparker_> once we like the idea, you or bender can wire things up right. this is mcguyver style
[15:18:30] <toddmparker_> ok, gotta run
[15:21:55] <Wilto> Okay.
[15:22:10] <Wilto> Just pushed a branch named “dialog-refactor” which also contains this new AJAX stuff.
[15:22:34] <Wilto> docs/pages/ajaxinclude.html
[16:49:52] <kinblas> Wilto: great I'll check it out
[19:24:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to dialog-refactor: http://git.io/Bj79sw
[19:24:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/dialog-refactor] Added popup docs pages - Todd Parker
[20:34:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to dialog-refactor: http://git.io/0nnWFw
[20:34:04] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/dialog-refactor] Added initial API docs for AJAX links for discussion - Todd Parker
[20:43:36] <toddmparker_> There is now a page in the dialog-refactor in docs/pages/popups/index.html with some examples
[20:44:29] <toddmparker_> and an ajax include page with a walkthrough of a proposed set of options and narrative (need to update the code) - docs/pages/ajaxinclude.html
[20:44:38] <toddmparker_> mat and i are going to refine these a bit
[20:44:41] <toddmparker_> tomorrow
[20:45:02] <toddmparker_> is there any way to set up live previews of branches, like /test/
