[02:55:53] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs: added dialog in api style (index/options/methods/events) - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[03:18:04] <agcolom> todd_: toddmparker_ : I have now added dialog in api style (index/options/methods/events) in master. I have not linked it up yet, ad I'd like someone to check that I haven't made any mistakes... Could someone please review and let me know. I'll link up the menu to the correct places once the content has been checked (I've kept index identical to our original dialog page, and I've created options,
[03:18:04] <agcolom> methods and events).
