[05:56:58] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fix-4978] Applying jQuery core commit https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/b0a352bfa76cbe1b65f8186d3cb90fe35a08866d - Jasper de Groot
[06:33:31] <uGoMobi> tested loader on iOS 3.0 (browserstack) and it looks fine
[06:34:59] <uGoMobi> BB5 is B-grade, no ajax no loader
[06:39:43] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: how's this look? https://gist.github.com/3721965
[06:41:17] <DaveMethvin> just updated the gist with the complete fn
[07:04:39] <JasonDScott> Which branch is the RC being cut from?
[07:05:27] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: master
[07:05:47] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Thanks
[07:18:15] <todd_> hi all
[07:23:55] <todd_> JasonDScott: if you want to hack away, use that branch uGoMobi created
[07:26:16] <uGoMobi> hi todd_
[07:27:51] <todd_> hey uGoMobi
[07:28:33] <todd_> thanks for making that branch
[07:28:33] <Wilto> Hey, what’s the score, folks?
[07:28:46] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: I am looking at the slider now
[07:28:53] <todd_> so here's one question: if this fix that dave landed last night will be for 1.8.2
[07:29:11] <todd_> is there something we can add on our end to prevent errors until then?
[07:29:16] <uGoMobi> yeah, was thinking the same
[07:29:51] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Can’t we just grab the `left` value instead of left offset? I imagine there’s a reason we aren’t.
[07:34:32] <todd_> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/
[07:34:36] <todd_> not there
[07:35:02] <todd_> maybe it's not updating
[07:35:07] <uGoMobi> Wilto: nah, we compare with the value of pageX of the input object
[07:35:28] <Wilto> Hwai?
[07:35:28] <MauriceG> Hi
[07:36:03] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[07:36:32] <todd_> hi MauriceG
[07:36:39] <todd_> adding your change log to the blog post
[07:37:07] <uGoMobi> todd_: hmm, not sure how that works with branch previews but I get the 404 too
[07:37:16] <MauriceG> Hi Todd, hold on !  I had a dirty database malfunction after a blackout this morning - Do you still need a all-in log?
[07:40:20] <uGoMobi> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/slider.js#L343
[07:40:29] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/slider.js#L48
[07:40:54] <Wilto> Hm.
[07:46:08] <uGoMobi> have to correct myself... no ajax doesn't mean no loader, but loader looks ok on BB5 too
[07:47:52] <todd_> MauriceG: i need that all-in log for mid next week, no rush
[07:48:43] <todd_> this looking hard to work around?
[07:48:56] <todd_> wondering if we should just tell people to use 1.7.2
[07:49:21] <todd_> if they care about these older browsers. tho that means we shouldn't enhance them. dang.
[07:49:38] <Wilto> Yeah, see, that’s where it gets weird.
[07:49:39] <uGoMobi> popups don't open at all on BB5
[07:50:12] <Wilto> One thing to “stop supporting” ’em, but then we should start de-enhancing ’em. That’s gonna be UA-sniffin’ chaos.
[07:50:27] <uGoMobi> on iOS3.0 the popup with positionTo window is ok, positionTo origin or selector shows up at top left corner with some margin
[07:50:45] <Wilto> Something something apostrophes.
[07:51:49] <uGoMobi> we could do an offset support check for the slider
[07:52:42] <uGoMobi> but that's only with core 1.8.2
[07:55:10] <MauriceG> todd_: ah, cool!   My database is up and running fine again. So it's no problem to generate a 1.2-all-in next week.
[07:55:31] <bikeshedder> When loading jquery mobile js almost the entire DOM seams to be cleared. Since I'm already using Knockout Templates and store them in a special <div class="js-templates" style="display: none">...</div> container element I'm having some issues using jquery.mobile with my project.
[07:55:33] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: did you ever test popups on BB5 with core 1.7.1 or 1.7.2 ?
[07:56:24] <bikeshedder> Is there any way to use jquery mobile in a non invasive way. I mean, without it having wipe my entire DOM. Right now I just want to use the button style and some utility functions of jq mobile
[07:57:48] <todd_> bikeshedder: this is the forum for the dev team, mind asking over in #jquerymobile, forums or SO?
[07:58:20] <scottjehl__> generally, though: yeah buttonMarkup is a simple $.fn jQuery plugin
[07:59:21] <bikeshedder> todd_: whops, found the channel in the #jquery topic. Word wrapping kept me from seeing the non-dev chan. sry.
[08:01:45] <Wilto> oh damn it’s scott jehl himself
[08:02:16] <Wilto> uGoMobi: I’m gonna look at this too.
[08:02:32] <uGoMobi> Wilto: cool
[08:02:40] <todd_> bikeshedder: np
[08:02:42] <todd_> one option is to just say, if you use 1.8, realize that core dropped support for X which will mean that some widgets won't work right in iOS3 and BB5
[08:03:13] <todd_> if we're built on core and they drop support for a platform/version...
[08:05:20] <Wilto> Alright, here’s my thinking:
[08:05:29] <Wilto> Slider is prolly solvable.
[08:05:48] <Wilto> The loading indicator could just be at the top of the page when offset isn’t available; whatever.
[08:06:03] <uGoMobi> Wilto: loader is not a problem
[08:06:11] <Wilto> Maybe we just default popups to being centered in the window, in the event that offset isn’t available?
[08:06:18] <Wilto> Yeah, no big there.
[08:06:29] <uGoMobi> looks like the loader widget already includes a fallback
[08:06:36] <Wilto> Yeah; seems fine.
[08:07:30] <kinblas> which offset is this?
[08:07:59] <uGoMobi> popup is acceptable too on iOS3.0 if you ask me, not sure popups not opening on BB5 have to do with this issue at all
[08:08:23] <uGoMobi> don't think so
[08:08:39] <Wilto> Hey kinblas!
[08:08:46] <kinblas> Wilto: hola
[08:08:49] <Wilto> So it’s just slider?
[08:08:54] <Wilto> I AM ON THE CASE
[08:09:03] <uGoMobi> hi kinblas
[08:09:25] <uGoMobi> Wilto: yes, but that's with core 1.8.2
[08:10:04] <uGoMobi> when is 1.8.2 final expected?
[08:11:39] <Wilto> Ionno. DaveMethvin?
[08:11:53] <todd_> so you guys think we can mitigate
[08:11:56] <uGoMobi> todd_: looks like branch preview isn't updating indeed...http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Branch%20Preview/
[08:12:06] <todd_> maybe johnbender can help with that
[08:12:10] <uGoMobi> yeah
[08:12:11] <todd_> or gnarf?
[08:12:22] <uGoMobi> don't know if we can manually trigger an update
[08:14:26] <scottjehl__> Hmm. Why's it erroring? Looks like this comment noted this case? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/offset.js#L32
[08:15:25] <todd_> DaveMethvin just anded that last night :)
[08:15:41] <todd_> 1.8.0 and .1 will error
[08:15:46] <todd_> scottjehl__ ^^
[08:16:57] <uGoMobi> going to test popups on BB5 with core 1.7.2 now
[08:17:17] <Wilto> Cool.
[08:17:39] <scottjehl__> cool
[08:17:46] <scottjehl__> thx
[08:17:47] <Wilto> I’m just gonna say it: BB5 is the future of web browsing, you guys.
[08:18:01] <Wilto> Love this clicky screen.
[08:18:25] <todd_> ugh
[08:21:14] <todd_> this is where I'd like to be later today for RC
[08:21:15] <todd_> http://jsbin.com/usebaf/2/
[08:21:23] <todd_> (my note for the blog post)
[08:21:24] <uGoMobi> ok popups never worked on BB5
[08:21:31] <uGoMobi> new issue :(
[08:21:39] <todd_> gist: can we workaround this on loader, popup, slider so these are at least functionl
[08:21:46] <todd_> really?
[08:21:51] <todd_> bah
[08:21:54] <Wilto> Hell.
[08:22:33] <todd_> ok, so loader and slider :)
[08:22:52] <todd_> i'd really like to drop BB5 to C soon
[08:24:04] <uGoMobi> have to say I test BB5 on simulator
[08:24:27] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: still around?
[08:24:54] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Here now
[08:25:13] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: looks like popups don't work at all on BB5
[08:25:32] <uGoMobi> I just tested on simulator with core 1.7.2 and 1.7.1
[08:25:44] <uGoMobi> can you test on real device, just to be sure?
[08:26:45] <JasonDScott> I can do that.
[08:26:49] <uGoMobi> cool
[08:27:21] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Are the other pages showing up ok for you?
[08:27:24] <uGoMobi> If it's the same result I can see if I can fix it
[08:27:45] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: yes
[08:31:24] <JasonDScott> hmm when I run your branch I loose all a lot of styles. It looks like plain html on my BB5
[08:32:53] <uGoMobi> weird
[08:34:20] <Wilto> Okay.
[08:34:25] <Wilto> So. Todd and I been talkin’.
[08:34:56] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: maybe the simulator doesn't simulate real device performance very well
[08:35:46] <JasonDScott> When I navigate to the popup page I get just the broken loading image
[08:36:17] <Wilto> We’re thinking it might be best to drop support for non-getBoundingRect browsers _provided_ they’re being used in conjunction with 1.8.x.
[08:36:31] <Wilto> Well, “de-enhance”
[08:36:47] <Wilto> Not “drop.” “Drop support” ain’t how we roll.
[08:37:24] <Wilto> johnbender, scottjehl__, gseguin, uGoMobi, _|Nix|_, er’rybody else. ^
[08:37:47] <uGoMobi> do you mean, make them C-grade in general?
[08:37:54] <Wilto> ajpiano, _chee, Wilto, Tom, Dick, Harry.
[08:37:57] <Wilto> Yeah.
[08:37:58] <uGoMobi> or just the widgets affected by this
[08:38:07] <Wilto> _Only_ if they’re using 1.8.x, however.
[08:38:19] <Wilto> 1.7.x and no getBoundingRect would be uneffected.
[08:38:28] <Wilto> affected. Whatever.
[08:38:44] <scottjehl__> so, add it to the qualifier? Hmm. Well, BB5 was always quite slow to parse jQ and jQM anyway.
[08:39:03] <Wilto> Yeah; that’s what we’re thinking. Not like we’re robbing them of an awesome experience.
[08:39:10] <scottjehl__> Probably better to do something simpler there
[08:39:16] <Wilto> And iOS 3.x share is negligible.
[08:39:54] <todd_> yeah BB5 is slooow
[08:40:02] <Wilto> ?mlm
[08:40:02] <JasonDScott> Yes it is
[08:40:02] <bot-t> much like myself
[08:40:05] <JasonDScott> Will we have another rating system? Or will this just be included in C
[08:40:28] <todd_> if you use jQM 1.2 with core 1.8.x AND don't support getBoundingClientRect - C grade
[08:40:32] <scottjehl__> As long as they get something usable with potential for styling a simple experience, that's fine by me
[08:40:37] <todd_> if you use 1.7.2 or lower, we enhance
[08:40:57] <todd_> and I think we should deprecate these browsers for C grade in 1.3
[08:41:04] <todd_> at least it's usable now
[08:41:05] <Wilto> scottjehl__: Exactly.
[08:41:21] <todd_> otherwise, all the 1.8.1 and .2 code will error out
[08:41:51] <todd_> jQ core supplies the version for us to grab in support
[08:41:58] <todd_> i need to hop off for a bit
[08:42:10] <todd_> but if people think this is solid, i'd rather move this way
[08:42:18] <Wilto> +1
[08:42:20] <todd_> still on track for RC is we make this change
[08:42:31] <todd_> figure that since we're built on core, we support what that do
[08:42:42] <todd_> for enhancements
[08:42:45] <todd_> PE FTW
[08:42:57] <Wilto> what does pe mean
[08:43:01] <Wilto> is that new
[08:43:19] <uGoMobi> :)
[08:43:40] <Wilto> Anyone opposed to this plan, before I take a five-pound sledge to this code?
[08:44:05] <uGoMobi> are BB5 and iOS3 only ones affected?
[08:44:36] <Wilto> Far as I’ve ever seen, yeah.
[08:44:58] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:45:10] <Wilto> I mean, it’s still feature-based, so it’s not like we’d be screwing any other wacky browser over. They just get demoted.
[08:45:36] <uGoMobi> yeah I see
[08:47:43] <uGoMobi> alright +1
[08:47:54] <JasonDScott> How will this change the experience they currently get on BB5?
[08:47:56] <uGoMobi> still means we need to fix popup on BB5
[08:48:10] <uGoMobi> for 1.72
[08:48:14] <Wilto> Could For sure.
[08:48:20] <Wilto> Whoop.
[08:48:25] <Wilto> “For sure, uGoMobi.”
[08:48:38] <Wilto> Is there a bug for that, or would you mind chucking one into the tracker?
[08:49:06] <Wilto> JasonDScott: BB5 would still be enhanced provided it’s using jQuery < 1.8.x.
[08:49:17] <uGoMobi> if JasonDScott can confirm they don't open on real BB5 device either I can open a ticket for it
[08:49:29] <uGoMobi> just noticed the issue, don't think it was reported yet
[08:49:36] <Wilto> JasonDScott: When using 1.8.x and up, BB5 will get the basic experience. Naturally, we’ll call that out in blog posts and such.
[08:50:18] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: The popup page on your branch is not even loading for me
[08:50:58] <uGoMobi> that branch load core 1.8.1 with patch for the offset issue
[08:51:53] <uGoMobi> can you test 1.7.2?
[08:52:11] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: do you test local? branch preview isn't working
[08:52:31] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: Yes I was testing locally
[08:52:40] <uGoMobi> ok
[08:53:38] <uGoMobi> and jquerymobile.com/test does load on that device?
[08:53:43] <JasonDScott> Wilto: I have not seen a basic exp. how does it compare?
[08:55:37] <JasonDScott> Wilto: is is just basic html, no button markup?
[08:55:53] <JasonDScott> s/is is/is it
[08:57:33] <Wilto> Yeah; effectively just markup.
[08:57:50] <JasonDScott> Ok
[08:57:54] <Wilto> Which is not to say you can’t write scripts and styles against a basic experience, it just doesn’t get jQM enhancement.
[08:58:23] <JasonDScott> Ok +1
[08:58:53] <Wilto> So let it be done.
[09:28:19] <gnarf> toddmparker_: somehow this morn jenkins started up a second process, cleaned him up, should be plenty of mem free now
[09:38:18] <toddmparker_> thanks gnarf
[09:38:45] <toddmparker_> so JasonDScott - that seem ok to RIM?
[09:39:15] <toddmparker_> since core dropped things BB5 needs, we're going to have a split between 1.7 and 1.8
[09:57:28] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_: Laurent was fine with it and I didn't get any other objections, so it seems ok
[09:57:47] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I can't seem to find this information anywhere. Do you know what support for Function.prototype.length looks like?
[09:58:02] <johnbender> unrelated to jquery(mobile?)
[09:58:15] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: it's the number of formal parmeters to the function
[09:58:21] <johnbender> s/jquery(mobile?)/jquery(mobile)?
[09:58:23] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: yes
[09:58:33] <DaveMethvin> oh but which browsers?
[09:58:35] <DaveMethvin> i think all of them
[09:58:41] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: that's what I thought
[09:58:51] <johnbender> I figured that if I didn't see any information on support it meant it was good everywhere
[09:58:54] <johnbender> :)
[09:58:55] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: thanks!
[09:58:58] <DaveMethvin> haha right
[09:59:08] <DaveMethvin> except BB5 :D
[09:59:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: are we ready to tag the RC?
[09:59:53] <JasonDScott> DaveMethvin: Will core be documenting its lack of support for BB5?
[10:00:04] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I heard back on the backbutton issue in Phonegap and it's green
[10:00:13] <johnbender> my fix works for him
[10:00:26] <DaveMethvin> JasonDScott: i'm not sure we ever documented support ... but in any case it's not black/white
[10:00:37] <DaveMethvin> only .offset() has less support than before
[10:00:41] <DaveMethvin> everything else works
[10:01:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ps, the entire afternoon I spent on the testswarm stuff yesterday produced a bug fix for recording the scroll position in IE
[10:03:12] <DaveMethvin> JasonDScott: do you know where I can get market share numbers for BB5? as a percent of BB total for example?
[10:04:56] <JasonDScott> DaveMethvin: I will try to find that for you.
[10:10:39] <DaveMethvin> thanks JasonDScott ... On the documentation issue, it's something we've been trying to figure out how to address. Right now BB5 probably has more consistent API coverage in core than IE6/7 but the holes are in different places.
[10:12:11] <JasonDScott> DaveMethvin: are the IE6/7 issues documented?
[10:12:38] <DaveMethvin> JasonDScott: they are in the bug tracker either as open bugs or wontfix bugs
[10:12:56] <JasonDScott> DaveMethvin: Ok
[10:13:04] <DaveMethvin> core doesn't have an idea of A/B/C grade support
[10:13:12] <DaveMethvin> in general we try to make them behave the same
[10:13:24] <DaveMethvin> but oldIE in particular sometimes just cannot do it
[10:16:49] <JasonDScott> DaveMethvin: It would be nice to have a caniuse.com like table in the api docs
[10:17:09] <DaveMethvin> JasonDScott: yes it would :D
[10:17:37] <JasonDScott> DaveMethvin: Any plans for something like that?
[10:17:43] <toddmparker_> for every method, you'd need to matrix all these
[10:17:43] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/gbs/
[10:17:52] <toddmparker_> it's a massive task
[10:17:56] <toddmparker_> but yes
[10:18:18] <DaveMethvin> yeah that's a lot of work, i'd love to have it but we need to find someone who'd volunteer to do the work
[10:18:50] <DaveMethvin> what we've been doing, which I absolutely don't like, is adding random notes to api pages for the most common issues
[10:19:10] <DaveMethvin> that tends to clutter up the reference material and make it harder to handle
[10:19:48] <DaveMethvin> most of these are edge cases so it seems bad to put them in the main text and make people read through it
[10:19:53] <DaveMethvin> something like caniuse would be ideal
[10:20:11] <DaveMethvin> and then just reference that link in the main aip docs
[10:20:14] <DaveMethvin> api
[10:23:29] <DaveMethvin> just fyi, open or unfixable bugs in IE7: http://bugs.jquery.com/query?keywords=~ie7&resolution=cantfix&resolution=patchwelcome&resolution=plugin&resolution=wontfix&or&status=assigned&status=open&status=reopened&keywords=~ie7&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=component&order=priority
[10:29:32] <Wilto> UNFIXABLE, YOU SAY?
[10:29:52] <Wilto> okay i believe you
[10:31:35] <Wilto> johnbender: Working on one last thing before we tag.
[10:31:39] <Wilto> Or am I too late?
[10:31:54] <johnbender> Wilto: you mean other than the BB thing?
[10:32:00] <Wilto> Oh, no, just that.
[10:32:08] <johnbender> Wilto: alright, I'm aware of that issue
[10:36:26] <johnbender> You know, the great thing about testing in IE is that if it works you can be pretty sure it will work everywhere else
[10:36:41] <johnbender> it's very much a subset of the "okness" of other browsers
[10:36:48] <johnbender> a proper subset
[11:00:54] <toddmparker_> so Wilto - did you make that change in master to kick out BB5 and iOS3 if 1.8.1 is in play?
[11:01:04] <Wilto> Locally, yeah; not pushed.
[11:01:29] <Wilto> johnbender: Just pinged you to check my work, if you’ve got a sec.
[11:02:37] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:02:46] <toddmparker_> Wilto: is that your one last thing?
[11:03:53] <Wilto> Yessir.
[11:08:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I think we're sorted
[11:08:57] <johnbender> Wilto: ?
[11:10:01] <toddmparker_> updating the blog post
[11:11:05] <Wilto> Will be sorted momentarily, yeah, sorry.
[11:11:33] <Wilto> Ugh, man. One of you have a BB5 within arm’s reach, just to confirm this?
[11:11:46] <Wilto> I can’t get this busted-ass phone to connect to the WiFi here.
[11:15:32] <toddmparker_> revised blog post section on this topic. Please review/edit:
[11:15:33] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/usebaf/3/
[11:15:54] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott: maybe you can help test?
[11:20:13] <JasonDScott> What would you like me to help test?
[11:23:03] <Wilto> So, the “Grade A” check would now be:
[11:23:09] <Wilto> return ( $.support.mediaquery || $.mobile.browser.ie && $.mobile.browser.ie >= 7 ) && ( $.support.boundingRect || $.fn.jquery.match(/[0-9]+\.[1-7]+?/) !== null );

[11:24:27] <Wilto> This seem reasonable enough? “If MQ supported OR Mobile IE/IE7+, AND you support getBoundingClientRect OR you’re using a version of jQuery <= 1.7.x”

[11:33:33] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: http://jsbin.com/usebaf/4/edit changes: "which a" > "which are" (first line) + removed "and below" after "Blackberry 5 and iOS 3" (BB4 is C grade anyway)
[11:38:08] <toddmparker_> thanks uGoMobi
[11:39:36] <toddmparker_> Wilto: seems right - uGoMobi and johnbender
[11:39:45] <johnbender> yar
[11:39:55] <Wilto> SHIP[ing] IT.
[11:39:58] <toddmparker_> can you help check that new support test
[11:40:00] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:40:18] <toddmparker_> once it's in, let's doa  quick pass to make sure things are enhancing correctly

[11:43:52] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Provided jQuery 1.8.x and up is in play: prevents browsers that don’t support getBoundingClientRect from being enhanced. jQuery 1.7.x and below are uneffected. - Mat Marquis
[11:44:01] <Wilto> Somebody proofread for me; I don’t trust me.
[11:45:49] <Wilto> Also, JasonDScott, can you give that a quick test? I’m flyin’ blind here.
[11:46:36] <toddmparker_> supa
[11:46:50] <toddmparker_> mat - you can do browserstack for iOS3
[11:47:38] <Wilto> Oh yeah; got 3.2 on my emulator. Didn’t think of that.
[11:47:45] <toddmparker_> Wilto: just tested http://jquerymobile.com/test/
[11:47:50] <Wilto> is it on fire todd
[11:47:53] <toddmparker_> on the stack with iOS and see a blank screen
[11:47:59] <toddmparker_> gray screen
[11:48:13] <Wilto> That is not too cool.
[11:48:16] <Wilto> One second.
[11:48:23] <toddmparker_> oh, now a loader
[11:48:28] <toddmparker_> but it shouldn't even try
[11:48:46] <Wilto> Nope.
[11:49:00] <toddmparker_> unless test isn't yet updated
[11:49:05] <Wilto> My iOS simulator crashed, and now refuses to open.
[11:49:08] <Wilto> I am having a fun day.
[11:50:37] <toddmparker_> Wilto: test seems old
[11:50:42] <toddmparker_> $.support.boundingRect is not in the js there
[11:51:14] <Wilto> Turning the crank to charge our 1st gen iPhone.
[11:51:34] <Wilto> This thing practically looks “steampunk” now.
[11:52:08] <toddmparker_> ok, it is now
[11:52:11] <Wilto> ooh tetris be back later
[11:52:13] <toddmparker_> yeah
[11:52:33] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[11:52:34] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #653: FIXED in 8 min 31 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/653/
[11:52:56] <Wilto> I gotta set up a pre-commit Grunt task. I keep forgetting to run it.
[11:53:28] <Wilto> toddmparker_: Error. Please hold.
[11:53:53] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:54:27] <Wilto> Oh, we still have pre-patch jQuery in there.
[11:55:09] <Wilto> So it still errors out within core.
[11:55:11] <Wilto> Uh… hm.
[11:58:47] <toddmparker_> thought we wouldn't even call that if it's not supported?
[11:59:23] <Wilto> It shouldn’t be, no. One sec; almost got it.
[11:59:32] <Wilto> (It’s an issue with my test, for certain.)
[12:04:41] <Wilto> dammit ios
[12:07:54] <toddmparker_> DAMMIT WILTO
[12:08:01] <Wilto> DAMMIT, REGEX
[12:08:04] <Wilto> It is actually my fault.
[12:08:13] <Wilto> johnbender: HELP
[12:08:22] <toddmparker_> scott jehl can help too
[12:10:58] <Wilto> Scratch that; got it.
[12:12:14] <johnbender> Wilto: :)
[12:12:18] <johnbender> Wilto: you good?
[12:12:45] <johnbender> I'm off to the gymn
[12:12:53] <Wilto> Think so. Just testing stuff like 2.7.1 and whatnot, to make sure I’m not gonna burn this sucker down in a couple years.
[12:13:44] <johnbender> Wilto: version number checking :(
[12:13:48] <uGoMobi> Wilto: good to hear you enjoy yourself :)
[12:14:11] <Wilto> Yeah, I know it…
[12:14:39] <Wilto> Protip: close your regexes.
[12:14:55] <Wilto> That one’s for free, you guys.
[12:16:35] <Wilto> Pushed.
[12:16:36] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: I like that gist.
[12:16:37] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/R2kgaQ

[12:16:48] <Wilto> 1\.[0-7+]\.[0-9+]?
[12:17:03] <Wilto> ?cc
[12:17:09] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: oh good because i landed it anyway
[12:17:11] <DaveMethvin> :D
[12:17:12] <Wilto> DAMMIT, BOT-T
[12:17:25] <DaveMethvin> now  you have two probems.
[12:17:34] <DaveMethvin> well 3 if you count bot-t
[12:17:47] <Wilto> I’ve got ninety-nine problems, myself.
[12:18:35] <toddmparker_> DaveMethvin: with what?
[12:18:42] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Despite DaveMethvin's fix, we still have the problem of claiming to support jQ 1.6.4 - 1.8.1 ... that's not true in the case of BB5 and iOS3 ... is that not so?
[12:19:00] <DaveMethvin> "support" is not binary tho, is it?
[12:19:14] <DaveMethvin> what exactly breaks now?
[12:19:27] <toddmparker_> latest now checks out in ios3 - basic styles
[12:19:46] <DaveMethvin> if you want to support offset on bb5 and os3 we could shim .offset() but it's gonna be a big chunk o code
[12:20:28] <DaveMethvin> so it'd be a plugin people could include, or you coudl add it to Mobile
[12:20:29] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Well, even if you release 1.8.2 and we add it to the list of supported jQ versions, we need to mention in the docs that BB% and iOS3 do not work with 1.7.2 - 1.8.1 ...
[12:20:44] <_|Nix|_> s/%/5/
[12:20:53] <DaveMethvin> "do not work" at all?
[12:21:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Wilto is working on that
[12:21:17] <DaveMethvin> like 1.8.1 because of the error thrown i guess, right
[12:21:22] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: No, because of the lack of try {} around the box = statement.
[12:21:27] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[12:21:45] <uGoMobi> BB5 and iOS3 + core 1.8+ --> C Grade
[12:21:56] <JasonDScott> so far so good on BB5 testing
[12:21:59] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Actually, worse.
[12:22:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: --> Broken, because you get the spinner forever.
[12:22:14] <DaveMethvin> yeah if it's crashing
[12:22:34] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: So, how's 1.8.2 looking?
[12:22:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that's what Wilto is fixing
[12:22:51] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: Is it likely to be out before jQM 1.2.0?
[12:22:59] <DaveMethvin> looking fine probably out sept 25
[12:23:04] <DaveMethvin> what's 1.2 schedule like?
[12:23:04] <_|Nix|_> OK, I've been gone too long.
[12:23:11] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: ^
[12:23:11] <uGoMobi> yup :)
[12:23:19] <uGoMobi> missed all the good stuff
[12:23:19] <JasonDScott> Multipage template is still breaking on BB5
[12:23:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/H-AZAQ
[12:23:44] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs CSS: Lighter page bg, added font-family so grade C looks nicer - toddparker
[12:23:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I figured there was good stuff I'd missed, but since it's good, it probably didn't need me :)
[12:23:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: why do BB5 and iOS3 do not work with 1.7.2?
[12:24:12] <DaveMethvin> first break shoudl be with 1.8.0
[12:24:20] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:24:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so > 1.7.2 && <= 1.8.1
[12:24:21] <DaveMethvin> at least the one related to .offset()
[12:24:25] <uGoMobi> 1.7.2 should be good
[12:24:43] <uGoMobi> actually already tested 1.7.2. on BB5
[12:24:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes, yes, but there is an interval of versions that is broken.
[12:25:02] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Forgive my imprecise formulation ...
[12:25:12] <DaveMethvin> so when's mobile 1.2 coming out?
[12:25:44] <DaveMethvin> and are you tryna support bb5/ios3 still as A/B browsers despite .offset()?
[12:25:48] <toddmparker_> 1.2 RC hopefully today
[12:25:54] <JasonDScott> Wilto: this still breaks on BB5 http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/multipage-template.html
[12:25:55] <toddmparker_> once we finish dealing with this
[12:26:12] <Wilto> Uh oh.
[12:26:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: one thing though... popups don't open on BB5, even not with 1.7.1 / 1.7.2
[12:27:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Noticed that too ...
[12:27:55] * _|Nix|_ jumps into action
[12:28:10] <_|Nix|_> I hope it's not another jQ trip-up :)
[12:28:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: FYI they were already broken in alpha 1
[12:28:28] <Wilto> DAMMIT, EVERYONE THAT HAS EVER COMMITTED TO CORE
[12:28:37] <DaveMethvin> haha
[12:28:45] <DaveMethvin> well, you gotta report it for us to fix it
[12:28:53] <Wilto> I still blame you personally, DaveMethvin.
[12:29:00] <DaveMethvin> and you should!
[12:29:21] <toddmparker_> popups on BB5 are broken. we need to log that issue if not already in the tracker
[12:29:24] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/outrage.gif
[12:29:36] * DaveMethvin renames core AUTHORS.txt to BLAME.txt
[12:29:46] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: on it
[12:29:58] <_|Nix|_> *nod*
[12:30:18] <uGoMobi> but it is still not confirmed on real BB5 device
[12:30:26] <Wilto> I ran a `git blame` and it just said “everybody.”
[12:30:30] <uGoMobi> because the whole page don't load :(
[12:31:09] <uGoMobi> s/don't/doesn't/
[12:31:14] <Wilto> I gotta eat lunch before I pass out on my keyboard; back shortly.
[12:31:24] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_, _|Nix|_, uGoMobi  should popups work in a grade-c browser?
[12:31:55] <toddmparker_> jason - not really. they should be anchors to the blob of content
[12:31:58] <toddmparker_> that's it tho
[12:32:02] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: not really, show/hide div popup
[12:32:29] <toddmparker_> C grade = no JS
[12:32:29] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: but BB5 with core 1.7 is B Grade
[12:32:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aaaah, there's my answer ^
[12:33:15] <DaveMethvin> uGoMobi: on which version does the page not load?
[12:33:33] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott: yes, it should be B (enhanced, no ajax nav)
[12:33:49] <uGoMobi> DaveMethvin: JasonDScott tested with 1.8.1. including the fix you landed
[12:34:11] <DaveMethvin> so did the page not load, or was there just some cosmetic thing?
[12:34:21] <toddmparker_> if you go to http://jquerymobile.com/test/
[12:34:23] <uGoMobi> DaveMethvin: but it did load on the simulator, so probably device performance issue
[12:34:32] <DaveMethvin> oh boy
[12:34:39] <toddmparker_> on ios3, you now see the C grade, basic HTML
[12:34:42] <toddmparker_> no errors
[12:34:46] <toddmparker_> BB5 should be the same
[12:34:48] <DaveMethvin> yay/2
[12:35:11] <toddmparker_> if you edit JS core to 1.7.x, you should see the enhanced experience
[12:35:24] <toddmparker_> BB5 may be buggy, that that's nothing new :)
[12:35:30] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_ this is still breaking in test http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/multipage-template.html
[12:36:25] <uGoMobi> on BB5 simulator jquerymobile.com/test/ works, C grade indeed
[12:36:47] <toddmparker_> sweet
[12:36:54] <DaveMethvin> it's like i used to say in college, nothing shameful about a good solid C
[12:37:05] <uGoMobi> :D
[12:37:08] <toddmparker_> we should confirm that other devies are enhancing right still
[12:37:08] <_|Nix|_> OK, so, lemme get this straight: BB5 + jQM master + jQ 1.7.1 === B-grade, right?
[12:37:22] <toddmparker_> but that is what is supposed to happen
[12:37:29] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: yes
[12:37:36] <toddmparker_> change to 1.8 = C
[12:37:56] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK, cuz I'm just looking at the popup breakage.
[12:37:58] <toddmparker_> because core is driving this degration, but mobile
[12:38:12] <toddmparker_> so it should work in 1.7 on BB5
[12:38:18] <JasonDScott> How are we documenting this: "BB5 + jQM master + jQ 1.7.1 === B-grade,"
[12:38:49] <_|Nix|_> We should have a matrix, not just a list on /gbs/
[12:39:19] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: does this page work for you in your sim http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/multipage-template.html
[12:39:20] <JasonDScott> ?
[12:39:30] <_|Nix|_> ... now that we support so many versions of jQ - OTOH, the only rows in that matrix that're interestring are iOS3 and BB5 ...
[12:39:32] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: no
[12:39:53] <JasonDScott> uGoMobi: should it work?
[12:40:34] <uGoMobi> JasonDScott: I suppose all pages should be displayed at once
[12:40:57] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: am I correct ^^
[12:41:01] <uGoMobi> ?
[12:41:13] <uGoMobi> multipage template on C grade browser
[12:41:16] <toddmparker_> WAIT - the multipage docs page points to the CDN version
[12:41:26] <toddmparker_> so that won't work. that's why you see the loader
[12:41:35] <uGoMobi> aha
[12:41:37] <JasonDScott> PHEW
[12:41:39] <toddmparker_> tricky
[12:44:20] <toddmparker_> multipage with 1.8.1 - http://jsbin.com/usebaf/6/
[12:44:49] <toddmparker_> same with 1.7.2 - http://jsbin.com/usebaf/7/
[12:49:35] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_: both of them worked on BB5
[12:49:53] <toddmparker_> yeah, same on iOS3
[12:50:03] <toddmparker_> maybe latest js isn't up to date?
[12:50:57] <toddmparker_> * jQuery Mobile Framework Git Build: SHA1: 7b0589947c368ffd1f77c5de57de5b651c9bf5a7 <> Date: Fri Sep 14 00:54:28 2012 +0300
[12:51:02] <toddmparker_> latest isn't latest
[12:51:41] <uGoMobi> opened a ticket for BB5 popup issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5006
[12:52:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: STOP
[12:53:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: popup works on my simple test page
[12:53:21] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[12:53:34] <uGoMobi> they just don't work in the docs
[12:53:41] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/axehav/4
[12:54:04] <toddmparker_> here is the SHA for test
[12:54:04] <toddmparker_> * jQuery Mobile Framework Git Build: SHA1: 83bf40c68737e02dca3815051416e6555c609542 <> Date: Fri Sep 14 15:15:24 2012 -0400
[12:54:20] <toddmparker_> so when latest js is updated, those bins should work as planned
[12:54:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's fine ... still gotta figure it out.
[12:56:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: also looks like on popup close you go back to previous page in history
[12:56:28] <uGoMobi> test page is with beta, changing that to latest now
[12:57:55] <toddmparker_> latest is stale uGoMobi
[12:58:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Thanks for noticing.
[13:04:42] <_|Nix|_> Looks like I never get a "navigate" event ...
[13:04:49] <Wilto> How we lookin’, gents?
[13:05:00] <uGoMobi> on latest (which is not latest) they are broken again: http://jsbin.com/axehav/5
[13:05:33] <Wilto> Semi-latest. Penulti-latest.
[13:05:55] <_|Nix|_> So, does that mean there's a latester somewhere?
[13:06:06] <Wilto> Yes, but it isn’t the latestest.
[13:06:23] <uGoMobi> no it means latest is too late
[13:06:37] <toddmparker_> anyone know how to fix that. gnarf?
[13:07:24] * _|Nix|_ opens js/jquery.mobile.navigation.js in a text editor ...
[13:07:33] <gnarf> toddmparker_: actually
[13:07:41] <gnarf> wanted to talk to you about latest / git
[13:07:58] <gnarf> is http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js supposed to be the active git build
[13:08:03] <gnarf> or the most recent stable release?
[13:08:23] <gnarf> because if its the later, it requires someone to manually put it there on release
[13:09:24] <gnarf> if its the former, I'd like to suggest a re-name of that URL
[13:09:39] <gnarf> in keeping with the other projects, it should be http://code.jquery.com/mobile/jquery.mobile-git.js
[13:10:03] <gnarf> or even /git/jquery.mobile.js
[13:10:05] <gnarf> if you prefer
[13:10:23] <gnarf> cause of CSS / images to serve
[13:10:35] <toddmparker_> it it the latest build from master, not stable
[13:10:56] <gnarf> toddmparker_: then I can look into getting it using the same release mechanism as the rest of the projects
[13:11:03] <gnarf> after a jenkins build, it copies a file there
[13:11:12] <gnarf> but i would really like to not use "latest"
[13:11:22] <gnarf> in the rest of the jQuery project "latest" = "latest stable version"
[13:12:08] <toddmparker_> i can see that
[13:12:09] <_|Nix|_> D000d ... on BB5, is there no hashchange event?
[13:12:15] <toddmparker_> nope
[13:12:20] <toddmparker_> well, it's busted
[13:12:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Was that in answer to my question?
[13:12:30] <toddmparker_> that's why it's B grade = no ajax nav
[13:12:36] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: yes
[13:12:52] <gnarf> toddmparker_: would /git/jquery.mobile.js work for you?  I could 301 from /latest
[13:12:54] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: OK, so we should have $.mobile.hashListeningEnabled = false then ...
[13:13:12] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: Or what's the flag that tells me that?
[13:13:24] <gnarf> then some day we could recoup "latest" to mean "latest stable"
[13:13:53] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.js
[13:14:06] <toddmparker_> that is basically the same as latest, but it's actually up to date
[13:14:40] <gnarf> they look like the same file to me todd

[13:14:51] <gnarf> on both
[13:15:01] <gnarf> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.js and http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.js
[13:15:06] <toddmparker_> maybe it updated
[13:15:19] <toddmparker_> see the different SHAs above
[13:19:05] <gnarf> toddmparker_: it can take like 5-10 minutes for the CDN to clear cache after a build
[13:19:15] <toddmparker_> gnarf: gotcha
[13:19:37] <gnarf> toddmparker_: we should figure something out about the /latest bit tho
[13:19:50] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: So, Ajax disabled is exactly equal to there is no hashchange?
[13:19:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ^
[13:20:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The reason I'm asking is that I'm thinking history: !$.mobile.browser.ie && $.mobile.ajaxEnabled
[13:20:49] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... for the popup options ...
[13:20:59] * gnarf cringes @ .browser ;)
[13:21:11] <toddmparker_> gnarf - agreed. tho I'm worried about the tons of jsbins out there was use latest
[13:21:26] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: This also means there won't be back button support for dismissing a popup on BB5 ...
[13:21:28] <toddmparker_> eddie set that up way back when
[13:21:33] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: right
[13:21:36] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: That's acceptable for B-grade, right?
[13:21:41] <gnarf> toddmparker_: right - 301 permanent should cache as well
[13:21:55] <toddmparker_> we already kill back button for WP7 on popup
[13:22:02] <gnarf> toddmparker_: just would require updating any "future" ones to not use /latest/ and use /git/ instead
[13:22:04] <toddmparker_> we have a way to handle that
[13:22:10] <gnarf> for a while we could make them "the same"
[13:22:24] <toddmparker_> sure
[13:22:29] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker_: We kill the back button for IE ...
[13:22:32] <toddmparker_> if you set that up, we'll start using it
[13:22:38] <gnarf> k
[13:22:42] <gnarf> i'll let you know
[13:23:09] <toddmparker_> cool
[13:32:32] <toddmparker_> so where we at?
[13:33:01] <Wilto> Same question.
[13:33:31] <toddmparker_> why are both those bins working?
[13:34:20] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/usebaf/9/
[13:34:24] <johnbender> gnarf: I cringed too but there's a scrolling issue we can't fix
[13:34:34] <toddmparker_> 1.7 + latest
[13:34:35] <johnbender> gnarf: we spent 3 or 4 days with more than 2 people working on it
[13:34:40] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that sounds perfect
[13:34:44] <johnbender> and good catch
[13:34:58] <toddmparker_> 1.7 + latest - http://jsbin.com/usebaf/10/
[13:35:16] <toddmparker_> gah. 1.8.1 + latest - http://jsbin.com/usebaf/10/
[13:35:46] <toddmparker_> ok, good. C grade on 10
[13:36:00] <toddmparker_> iOS3
[13:36:05] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott: can you confirm?
[13:37:10] <JasonDScott> Confirmed C grade on 10
[13:38:14] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott: is 9 also C for you?
[13:38:26] <toddmparker_> shouldn't be (1.7.1) but it is on iOS3
[13:38:38] <toddmparker_> Wilto: maybe that's not quite right
[13:39:02] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_: Yes C grade on 9
[13:39:23] <Wilto> Ah, hell.
[13:40:56] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: There's a problem: At the time when the popups are created, ajaxEnabled is true, however, it is set to false later on in the code, it seems.
[13:41:06] <toddmparker_> if you use latest with 1.7.1, iOS3 and BB5 should be enhanced
[13:41:08] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: history: ( !$.mobile.browser.ie && ( function() { alert( "ajaxEnabled: " + $.mobile.ajaxEnabled ); return $.mobile.ajaxEnabled; }() ) )
[13:41:10] <toddmparker_> can you test locally?
[13:41:19] <_|Nix|_> That alerts true ...
[13:41:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: ah, after mobile init
[13:41:45] <johnbender> hmm
[13:41:47] <johnbender> no that doesn't make sense
[13:42:01] <johnbender> wait
[13:42:02] <johnbender> yes it does
[13:42:03] <johnbender> lol
[13:42:09] * johnbender is not very smart
[13:42:21] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, so we can't do that elegantly.
[13:42:22] <johnbender> mobile init is triggered after the libraries are loaded but before they enhance the page
[13:42:27] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: just set it in create
[13:42:33] <johnbender> _create
[13:42:58] <johnbender> this.options.history = this.options.history && $.mobile.ajaxEnabled;
[13:43:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, actually, I'll check it in open. After all, people can turn off ajax at any point during the runtime.
[13:43:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Popup behaviour should adapt to runtime configuration changes.
[13:43:35] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: hmm true, I'm worried that introduces issues if we have some other opening mechanism later
[13:43:46] <johnbender> ie, if we bypass open: to use _open
[13:43:46] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Like what?
[13:43:52] <johnbender> for some reason in the future
[13:43:55] <johnbender> that I can' think of
[13:44:13] <johnbender> I think it's less important to support changing that mid execution
[13:44:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: _open is only the graphical part. open is the management.
[13:44:20] <johnbender> given that we really don't allow that with almost any other setting
[13:44:36] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right, but I could see us using _open for something in the future and skipping that check
[13:44:56] <johnbender> if we run into cases where people need to disable ajax mid way through execution and they are using popups at thes ame time we can move it
[13:45:01] <johnbender> we can't do the reverse
[13:45:16] <johnbender> I have to imagine that set of people is vanishingly small
[13:45:26] <johnbender> and _create is the latest binding that seems safe to me
[13:45:36] <johnbender> they all run _create
[13:45:41] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[13:45:43] <johnbender> that's a much stronger guarantee
[13:46:38] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: and make sure it checks the option value and not mobile.ie in _create otherwise we'll step on people's custom settings
[13:46:43] <johnbender> or both
[13:46:49] <johnbender> but it needs to check the option value
[13:47:26] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: this.options.history = this.options.history && $.mobile.ajaxEnabled
[13:47:31] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Does js have &&=?
[13:47:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I wish it did :(
[13:47:52] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ...
[13:47:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: so many times I've missed ||= from ruby
[13:54:24] <Wilto> Just confirmed: iOS 3.x.x is enhanced with jQuery 1.7.2, non-enhanced with 1.8.x.
[13:54:34] <Wilto> Thumbs-up and high-fives all around.
[13:54:54] <_|Nix|_> The world is safe for another day!
[13:59:23] <Wilto> THE END???
[13:59:36] <johnbender> lol
[13:59:41] <johnbender> comic book ending ftw
[13:59:58] <Wilto> Then Android 1.6’s hand comes bursting out of the ground or something.
[14:00:45] <_|Nix|_> Eeeet's a meeeracle! Popups on BB5 are back!
[14:01:02] <Wilto> Sweet.
[14:01:06] <toddmparker_> _|Nix|_: yeah??
[14:01:09] <toddmparker_> nice
[14:01:26] <johnbender> yah I blew that history check :(
[14:01:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: really good catch _|Nix|_
[14:01:41] * johnbender grumbles about double highlights
[14:01:49] <_|Nix|_> I wouldn't call it nice. The popups all appear at the top of the page.
[14:01:54] <_|Nix|_> So, some coords are off.
[14:02:11] <johnbender> it works though
[14:02:16] <_|Nix|_> Sure does.
[14:02:52] <_|Nix|_> Wait ... I'm an idiot ... it only works because I wrapped a bunch of things in try{}s.
[14:03:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to testswarm: http://git.io/4GedgQ
[14:03:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/testswarm] switch to changepage and debug statements for ie failures in testswarm T_T - John Bender
[14:03:18] <_|Nix|_> I still gotta figure out why those things fail to begin with. I was so happy to see popups though ...
[14:06:17] <_|Nix|_> OK, NM ... try{}s are gone and it still works ... *scratch head*
[14:06:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/ctsKAw
[14:06:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added a clear on the copyright to improve C experience in the docs - toddparker
[14:06:43] * _|Nix|_ clears history
[14:06:55] * _|Nix|_ means cache, of course ...
[14:07:21] <Wilto> Guys, serious question:
[14:07:40] <Wilto> What the hell is up with this “warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in […]” situation I keep running into?
[14:08:12] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Different platforms use different character (pairs) for line separation.
[14:08:22] <Wilto> Yeah, but how do I… make that go away forever?
[14:08:43] <Wilto> I found some command that disables whatever this conversion is, but it keeps happening.
[14:08:43] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Sounds like it's converting from Windoze to Unix or Mac or whatever.
[14:09:06] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: You install Linux, and convince everyone else to do the same.
[14:09:13] <Wilto> BOOO
[14:09:20] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Then it's \n forever ...
[14:09:27] <Wilto> Linux is for nerds, and I’m _cool_. I got sports opinions and everything.
[14:09:36] <Wilto> I mean, I just don’t wanna include this in a commit.
[14:09:55] <Wilto> Otherwise, checking it out doesn’t get rid of the file, and a diff shows the entire file all over again.
[14:10:06] <_|Nix|_> YOu get that message whenever you commit?
[14:11:37] <Wilto> #	modified:   js/jquery.js

[14:12:11] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: rm js/jquery.js; git checkout js/jquery.js ...
[14:12:40] <toddmparker_> k, just double confirmed that the tests work
[14:12:49] <Wilto> $ git status
[14:12:50] <Wilto> #	modified:   js/jquery.js
[14:12:56] <toddmparker_> iOS3 is enhanced in 1.7.1 and C grade in 1.8.1
[14:13:06] <toddmparker_> Wilto was exactly testing latest
[14:13:16] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott: you can confirm on BB5, right?
[14:13:23] <toddmparker_> just double checking everything
[14:13:55] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_: Do you have links?
[14:14:09] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: WTF?! Still?
[14:14:15] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott: kickin' it old school
[14:14:16] <Wilto> Mmyep.
[14:14:22] <Wilto> $ git stash
[14:14:30] <Wilto> warning: CRLF will be replaced by LF in js/jquery.js.
[14:14:30] <Wilto> The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
[14:14:38] <toddmparker_> I just changed the js ref in the head of my index page
[14:14:40] <toddmparker_> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.1.min.js"></script>
[14:14:47] <Wilto> $ git status == “modified:   js/jquery.js”
[14:14:50] <toddmparker_> and fiddled with version #'s
[14:14:58] <toddmparker_> viewed thru localhost
[14:15:04] <Wilto> I can only get rid of the changes if I commit them.
[14:15:06] <toddmparker_> on an original iphone
[14:15:21] <Wilto> And then I’m committing an entire file all over again for the sake of some bunk line endings.
[14:16:11] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: Interesting, because it seems git converts to LF when storing things internally, but will convert back to your favourite OS' line ending style when you check out.
[14:17:21] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: https://help.github.com/articles/dealing-with-line-endings
[14:19:26] <Wilto> “The best way to do this is wipe out your working tree (all the files except the .git directory) and then restore them.”
[14:19:27] <Wilto> Ugh.
[14:20:15] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_: Seems good. Just to confirm i am testing against
[14:20:15] <JasonDScott>   <script src="http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.js"></script> correct?
[14:20:35] <toddmparker_> JasonDScott: i was just testing all local code to be sure
[14:20:43] <toddmparker_> those cdn links have been stale all day
[14:20:58] <toddmparker_> i was only pointing to the cdn for jQuery core
[14:22:24] <johnbender> are we modifying js/jquery.js?
[14:22:30] <_|Nix|_> Wilto: You should only need to do this once ...
[14:23:31] <Wilto> I don’t know what’s about to happen.
[14:24:45] <Wilto> Ugh, just gonna re-clone.
[14:25:58] <toddmparker_> johnbender: what do you meanby modifying js/jquery.js?
[14:26:18] <toddmparker_> i was just swapping that out for the CDN link on a local page so I can quickly change verisons
[14:35:23] <JasonDScott> toddmparker_: it looks like both are C grade
[14:36:25] <Wilto> Oh, this is stupid.
[14:36:42] <Wilto> I GIVE UP.
[14:36:47] <Wilto> You guys need me for anything else?
[14:42:00] <JasonDScott> Wilto, toddmparker_: Its good, file was not updated correctly. 1.7.2 B Grade, 1.8.1 C Grade.
[14:42:33] <JasonDScott> Great job Wilto
[14:42:45] <Wilto> Ah, weren’t nothin’.
[14:45:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I heard someone talk about patching jquery or some such locally
[14:46:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: just double checking
[14:51:35] <toddmparker_> nope, think we're good johnbender
[14:51:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: tag and deploy?
[14:51:48] <toddmparker_> i'm tinkering with some better basic (non-js) styles
[14:51:54] <toddmparker_> by adding some love to docs.css
[14:52:00] <toddmparker_> looks way better
[14:54:09] <toddmparker_> checked that in
[14:54:19] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: mind taking a look?
[14:54:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/2tmJMQ
[14:54:23] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Added more docs CSS tweaks for better C grade experience - toddparker
[14:54:30] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: sure
[14:54:38] <toddmparker_> i basically added some LI rules so they look more finger-friendly
[14:54:50] <toddmparker_> trying to be careful because these are wide open styles
[14:55:01] <toddmparker_> i.e. they effect enhanced too
[14:55:12] <uGoMobi> I understand
[14:55:32] <toddmparker_> but seems like most of our enhanced styles have higher specificity so they undo what i added
[14:56:32] <toddmparker_> the only thing impacted in a negative way is the HTML styles page where the UL is
[14:56:55] <toddmparker_> the lines I added to LIs bleed thru on basic lists but it looks kinda cool
[14:57:42] <toddmparker_> see: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/about/platforms.html
[14:57:56] <toddmparker_> turn off JS to see basic
[14:58:19] <uGoMobi> yeah, nothing wrong with those lines :)
[15:00:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: how about wrapping the 45 degrees ribbon style in a media query?
[15:01:02] <uGoMobi> min-width 1px or something
[15:01:34] <uGoMobi> just so old IE don't understand it
[15:01:46] <uGoMobi> and other older browsers
[15:05:08] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: looks good the adjusted styles for C grade, don't see any conflicts with A grade either
[15:06:57] <toddmparker_> cool
[15:07:05] <toddmparker_> we can probably do more fixes as time allows
[15:07:22] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: idea
[15:07:22] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:07:55] <uGoMobi> actually the first time I really looked at C grade
[15:08:27] <toddmparker_> heh
[15:08:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/rmbMSA
[15:08:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Scoped version to .ui-mobile-viewport to hide on C grade - toddparker
[15:08:32] <toddmparker_> pushed a fix
[15:08:48] <toddmparker_> we can use .ui-mobile-viewport to only kick in stuff if enhanced
[15:08:59] <toddmparker_> for docs only stuff
[15:09:18] <uGoMobi> yes, but was also thinking about IE7/8
[15:09:47] <toddmparker_> sure
[15:10:13] <toddmparker_> but we inject the version with JS so i'd rather not have an empty version flag
[15:10:22] <uGoMobi> but probably IE9 doesnt' understand the transform IE
[15:10:42] <toddmparker_> johnbender: I think we can do our build now
[15:10:48] <toddmparker_> any last requests?
[15:10:59] <Wilto> A cigarette and a blindfold, Todd.
[15:10:59] <uGoMobi> was thinking just put the background style in the media query
[15:11:07] <uGoMobi> still show the content
[15:11:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: deploying
[15:12:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: if you're happy I'll bump the version.txt and tag
[15:12:19] <uGoMobi> don't see -ms-transform there
[15:12:47] <toddmparker_> the content isn't there if not enhanced, right uGoMobi
[15:13:47] <toddmparker_> johnbender: let do this
[15:13:57] <Wilto> LOCK AND LOAD.
[15:13:59] <uGoMobi> we can look at this after RC
[15:15:39] <toddmparker_> yeah uGoMobi
[15:15:46] <toddmparker_> prolly do that better
[15:16:18] <uGoMobi> the empty ribbon on C grade will be gone after your commit
[15:16:49] <uGoMobi> just thinking what looks best if browser doesn't support transform
[15:17:31] <toddmparker_> ah, i see
[15:17:40] <toddmparker_> yeah, worth looking at
[15:17:57] <toddmparker_> johnbender: tell me when we're done and I'll blog
[15:20:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: deployed
[15:20:34] <toddmparker_> woo hoo
[15:20:43] <uGoMobi> nice :D
[15:21:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll tag
[15:22:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: done
[15:24:42] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2012/09/14/jquery-mobile-release-candidate-1-released/
[15:25:02] <toddmparker_> i of course forgot to add 1.2.0 in the original title, thus the bad URL
[15:25:08] <toddmparker_> no friday releases
[15:25:18] <Wilto> WHAT COULD GO WRONG
[15:25:20] <uGoMobi> I thought on Jelly Bean the native browser is same as Chrome, but I see differences while testing my fixed toolbar jitter fix :(
[15:25:34] <johnbender> uGoMobi: who knows
[15:25:43] <johnbender> I thought the same thing but it certainly acts different
[15:25:51] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it might be that chrome is installed by default
[15:25:51] <uGoMobi> yup
[15:25:53] <toddmparker_> ok, gotta run
[15:25:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: laters
[15:26:00] <toddmparker_> let's hope there are no fires
[15:26:03] <toddmparker_> thanks all!!
[15:26:06] <uGoMobi> have a nice weekend toddmparker_
[15:26:34] <uGoMobi> johnbender: I dunno, I updated from ICS
[15:27:01] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I really actually don't know
[15:27:06] <johnbender> gseguin_: you around?
[15:27:26] <uGoMobi> well I just keep testing on both :)
[15:29:03] <gseguin_> hey 'sup johnbender ?
[15:29:22] <johnbender> gseguin_: do you know if chrome is the default browser in jelly bean?
[15:29:29] <johnbender> I have it installed and they live side by side
[15:29:35] <johnbender> the native browser is still included it appears
[15:30:18] <gseguin_> it's not
[15:30:39] <johnbender> uGoMobi: there you ahve it
[15:30:45] <uGoMobi> yeah
[15:30:47] <johnbender> uGoMobi: it appears they are both there
[15:31:31] <uGoMobi> who said native browser = chrome? think I saw toddmparker_ mention it
[15:31:52] <uGoMobi> and I am a parrot :D
[15:32:00] <johnbender> gnarf: UI has had issues with IE and browserstack right?
[15:32:19] <johnbender> gnarf: I can't seem to get it to fail the same way when I check manually
[15:36:50] <uGoMobi> I am off... have a great weekend all!
[15:37:04] <gseguin_> you too Jasper
[21:37:34] <gnarf> johnbender: have you tried in a browserstack vm ?
[21:38:00] <gnarf> we have had issues with ______ and browserstack VMs
[21:38:03] <gnarf> on core and ui
[21:38:07] <gnarf> :)
