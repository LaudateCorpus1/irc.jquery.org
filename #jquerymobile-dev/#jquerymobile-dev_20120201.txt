[01:39:49] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl created toolbar-persist (+1 new commit): http://git.io/0WQF4w
[01:39:49] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/toolbar-persist] brought back persistent toolbar behavior as an external extension to the fixedToolbar plugin (via option trackPersistentToolbars, default true when included). This also extends persistent toolbar support to headers, whereas previously only footers were supported. - scottjehl
[01:55:29] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[01:55:30] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #10: FIXED in 2 min 49 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/10/
[01:55:30] <jq-jenkins> scott: updated the docs theme to specify font like the themes do
[07:59:39] <jzaefferer> johnbender: looks like you got the build working on Jenkins
[07:59:46] <jzaefferer> how far along are you with the selenium integration?
[08:37:24] <johnbender> jzaefferer: that's just the build that updates jquerymobile.com/test and pushes the latest to the cdn for people to test against HEAD
[08:37:34] <johnbender> I haven't made any progress on the test build
[08:38:48] <johnbender> jzaefferer: that requires installing xvfb, chrome, firefox, and their respective selenium plugins/drivers.
[08:39:07] <johnbender> so I'm kind of wondering if it wouldn't be better to look into the browser stack integration you mentioned
[08:39:33] <johnbender> I'm finishing up my presentation for LA Ruby Conf this week but after that I should be able to look into it
[08:39:39] <gseguin> Good morning
[08:40:01] <gseguin> I'm on jQM today
[08:42:36] <johnbender> gseguin: yay!
[08:42:50] <gseguin> johnbender: I lost my credentials for jenkins
[08:42:52] <gseguin> :D
[08:43:01] <johnbender> gseguin: let me take a look
[08:43:02] <gseguin> I have 2 logins
[08:43:10] <gseguin> gseguin and ghislain
[08:43:37] <gseguin> and none of them had admin cred
[08:44:04] <johnbender> gseguin: which one should?
[08:44:10] <gseguin> johnbender: Q why is the jQM job called "jQuery Mobile Latest"
[08:44:27] <johnbender> gseguin: because that's what we're building, the latest
[08:44:32] <gseguin> johnbender: is there a standard for logins?
[08:44:43] <johnbender> gseguin: nope you just need to choose one
[08:44:50] <gseguin> ghislain then
[08:44:59] <gseguin> you can remove gseguin
[08:45:03] <johnbender> gseguin: also that build pushes the js to the cdn for people to test against
[08:45:15] <johnbender> gseguin: you actually have 3 :/
[08:45:17] <johnbender> lol
[08:45:36] <gseguin> I guess I'm really persistent when I want to access something ;)
[08:47:25] <johnbender> gseguin: it doesn't look like I can promote you
[08:47:31] <johnbender> you'll have to ask jzaefferer
[08:47:38] <gseguin> oh man!...
[08:48:26] <gseguin> alright, jzaefferer: ^
[08:48:48] <gseguin> could you give me admin privileges on jQuery Mobile's jobs?
[08:50:52] <jzaefferer> so what's your account?
[08:51:03] <gseguin> ghislain
[08:51:12] <gseguin> also I lost my password
[08:51:12] <jzaefferer> also johnbender look under general jenkins config
[08:51:22] <jzaefferer> you should be able to give access to everything
[08:51:52] * gseguin is embarassed and promises to not do it again
[08:52:04] <jzaefferer> xfvb should be installed already on that machine, but getting chrome and firefox to run there could be more of an issue
[08:52:55] <jzaefferer> as for testswarm integration, you could start by extending this job: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile/
[08:53:13] <jzaefferer> currently it has only buttonMarkup listed as a module to test
[08:53:25] <gseguin> ah that's what I'm interested in
[08:53:47] * gseguin doesn't have too much love left for selenium
[08:53:54] <jzaefferer> johnbender: can you access this? http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/configure
[08:56:32] <gseguin> jzaefferer: you use browserstack to connect to the swarm, right?
[08:58:47] <jzaefferer> that's the idea
[08:58:52] <jzaefferer> the integration is still a work in progress
[08:59:16] <jzaefferer> clarkbox, who isn't in here but in #jqueryui-dev, is working on that
[08:59:31] <gseguin> ok
[08:59:55] <gseguin> is there things I can look at to see how it's done (without touching) ?
[09:08:17] <johnbender> jzaefferer: yes, I forgot that the permissions were not user specific but server specific in a gigantic table :/
[09:09:35] <jzaefferer> its not that bad
[09:09:43] <jzaefferer> just add the username and click a few checkboxes
[09:10:06] <johnbender> jzaefferer: nope it works fine, and I've used it before, just not the most obvious location
[09:10:10] <gseguin> johnbender: I also need my password reset
[09:10:13] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[09:14:03] <johnbender> gseguin: heading into the office
[09:14:04] <johnbender> brb
[09:14:08] <gseguin> alright I'm in!
[10:26:26] <johnbender> gseguin: did you get sorted with the server?
[10:28:43] <gseguin> yup
[10:28:50] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[10:28:51] <gseguin> I logged in just fine
[10:29:36] <johnbender> jzaefferer: where can I check out what's been done with browser stack so far
[10:29:48] <johnbender> I'm curious how the test results are retrieved

[11:43:36] <gseguin> jzaefferer: in where do you define the list of browsers you want to run the test against?
[11:43:45] <gseguin> s/in//
[11:45:07] <jzaefferer> gseguin: testswarm has "lists", when submitting jobs, you select on of them
[11:46:02] <gseguin> jzaefferer: can it be open? like: "any browser that connects to the swarm"?
[11:46:21] <jzaefferer> nope
[11:46:41] <gseguin> where can I change that list for jQM ?
[11:46:43] <jzaefferer> you should read up on testswarm: https://github.com/jquery/testswarm
[11:46:51] <jzaefferer> https://github.com/jquery/testswarm/wiki
[11:47:31] <jzaefferer> most stuff can be configured as part of the job: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile/configure
[11:47:43] <jzaefferer> "Choose browsers"
[11:49:06] <gseguin> but that doesn't let me pick a specific browser
[11:49:22] <jzaefferer> yep
[13:17:10] <gseguin> jzaefferer: can I add user agents to the testswarm db?
[13:30:47] <gseguin> johnbender: do you know if it's ok to mess around with the testswarm db on swarm.jquery.org ?
[13:31:05] <gseguin> by messing around I mean add user agents
[14:26:58] <toddmparker_> hey all
[14:27:05] <gseguin> hey toddmparker_
[14:27:20] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[14:27:20] <toddmparker_> sorry, meeting filled dat
[14:27:21] <toddmparker_> day
[14:27:29] <gseguin> no worries
[14:27:42] <gseguin> I've been looking into testswarm
[14:27:45] <gseguin> very neat
[14:28:30] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I remember I told I was going to look into something today but I don't recall what that was
[14:30:19] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[14:30:21] <toddmparker_> yeah
[14:31:00] <toddmparker_> what was it...
[14:56:50] <gseguin> toddmparker_: got it: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3217#issuecomment-3725650
[14:56:51] <socialhapy> â˜… Issue #3217 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1m, 4w ago): Page transition re-think: Smoother, faster
[14:57:20] <toddmparker_> ah, right. genius!
[14:58:07] <gseguin> holly smokes it's a long thread!
[14:58:14] <toddmparker_> so i want to dig in and understand what the crazy long delay is before a transition starts and in the middle where we scroll durning transitions
[14:58:17] <toddmparker_> heh
[14:58:24] <toddmparker_> it's all the transition work
[14:58:29] <toddmparker_> kinda cool to capture it all
[14:58:38] <toddmparker_> since you have ICS
[14:58:56] <toddmparker_> think you or someone said it was waiting for the hash stuff to hit
[14:59:26] <kinblas> toddmparker_: you might want to actually put in a timer at the point the click starts, then the transition start to seperate that out
[14:59:59] <kinblas> toddmparker_: oh did you mean on back-button?
[15:00:25] <toddmparker_> no, i think it's just in general
[15:00:30] <toddmparker_> right gseguin?
[15:00:38] <toddmparker_> lot of time just sitting there
[15:01:36] <gseguin> opening /test on my phone
[15:01:48] <toddmparker_> kk
[15:02:03] <kinblas> if it's on back, then the hashchange is involved
[15:02:05] <kinblas> if it's click
[15:02:13] <kinblas> then it's the 300ms delay
[15:03:16] <kinblas> in both cases it sucks because we're at the mercy of the browser ... so if you think it's the transitions, then we have to measure from the point the transition is fired to when the complete is dispatched
[15:03:28] <gseguin> that's the delay between touchstart and click, right kinblas ?
[15:03:36] <kinblas> right
[15:05:54] <gseguin> the delay I see is between the in and out of the transition
[15:07:29] <gseguin> I'll play around on my localhost see if I can identify the problem

[16:09:13] <johnbender> gseguin: question for you
[16:09:21] <gseguin> shoot
[16:14:18] <johnbender> gseguin: you there?
[16:15:00] <johnbender> gseguin: you there?
[16:15:18] <johnbender> gseguin: both the control group and select tests are broken looking for js/order.js
[16:16:04] <gseguin> arghhh
[16:16:12] <gseguin> my bad
[16:16:21] <gseguin> I moved order to external/requirejs
[16:16:35] <johnbender> gseguin: no worries, I just wasn't sure how to address it
[16:17:13] <johnbender> do we just explicitly include it in our lood?
[16:17:17] <gseguin> 1st question is do we need to use the order plugin
[16:17:20] <johnbender> yes
[16:17:25] <johnbender> well
[16:17:33] <johnbender> it appears to be required at least by the tests
[16:17:35] <gseguin> we don't need it anymore in jquery.mobile.js
[16:17:45] <johnbender> orly?
[16:17:51] <gseguin> yup
[16:18:02] <johnbender>  well
[16:18:05] <johnbender> let me try it I guess
[16:18:47] <johnbender> well the tests are passing but that doesn't mean there aren't issues
[16:18:53] <johnbender> err
[16:18:54] <johnbender> that is
[16:18:57] <johnbender> in the controlgroup suite
[16:19:21] * gseguin pulls it up
[16:19:50] <johnbender> the select tests are the only other ones that use it
[16:19:58] <johnbender> just to force the order of the test files  themselves :/
[16:20:15] <gseguin> oh I know
[16:20:32] <gseguin> remember I moved the init of controlgroup to the init
[16:20:38] <gseguin> so it happens last
[16:20:45] <gseguin> to handle soft dependencies
[16:21:03] * gseguin notes that we really need some kind of registry for the widgets
[16:21:11] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[16:25:12] <johnbender> gseguin: yah we do
[16:25:17] <johnbender> gseguin: 1.2 +
[16:25:24] <gseguin> yeah
[16:25:31] <johnbender> gseguin: I have ideas
[16:25:44] <gseguin> so anyways controlgroup doesn't need order anymore
[16:25:58] <johnbender> gseguin: cool
[16:26:08] <gseguin> and I'm not sure why select had it in the first place
[16:26:16] <johnbender> looks like the select plugins are good
[16:26:23] <johnbender> yah it might have been left overs from my debugging
[16:26:30] <johnbender> gseguin: they were on the test files themselves
[16:26:49] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm working on getting everything consistently green at test/unit/
[16:26:56] <johnbender> so that we can point testswarm at that
[16:26:59] <gseguin> yeah I know but they seem to pass without
[16:27:11] <johnbender> gseguin: yep
[16:27:22] <gseguin> so remove
[16:27:26] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm going to let them ride like that and let the ci tell me to do it
[16:27:31] <johnbender> gseguin: I got it
[16:27:34] <johnbender> just wanted to ask
[16:27:57] <gseguin> they also pass in phantomjs
[16:28:22] <gseguin> which is a good way to validate amd crap
