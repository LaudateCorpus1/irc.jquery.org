[07:40:53] <Wilto> gseguin: Ping.
[08:17:17] <jzaefferer> Wilto: not exactly bombing, but there's room for improvement

[08:30:56] <Wilto> Yo yo.
[08:31:20] <gseguin> what can I do for you?
[08:31:38] <Wilto> When you have a couple minutes, could you sort the “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” dealie on the builder.
[08:32:31] <Wilto> Also, here’s a thing I completely forgot: we gotta manage CSS dependencies on that thing, somehow.
[08:33:36] <gseguin> yeah I had started looking into the CSS thing but got side tracked
[08:33:54] <gseguin> the CORS thing should be set to *
[08:34:09] <gseguin> isn't it?
[08:34:17] <Wilto> Oh. Something else may be amiss.
[08:34:18] <Wilto> http://amd-builder.no.de/jquery-mobile/master/dependencies?baseUrl=js
[08:36:25] <gseguin> wrong url
[08:36:37] <gseguin> though something seems to be up with the service
[08:36:43] * gseguin looks
[08:43:53] <gseguin> Wilto: don't know what was up I restarted the service
[08:43:54] <gseguin> http://amd-builder.no.de/v1/dependencies/jquery/jquery-mobile/master/?name=jquery.mobile&baseUrl=js

[08:59:45] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fixedtoolbar-polyfill] bit of a refactor to get things cued from the fixed nav plugin, per instance. Still not quite finished. - scottjehl
[09:04:05] <Wilto> gseguin: Oh, oh, gotcha. I thought it was just gonna be down for a bit.
[09:04:24] <gseguin> nope I changed the API
[09:04:44] <gseguin> there is something not working though it's not taking updates from github for some reason
[09:04:54] <gseguin> I just tested it locally and it worked
[09:05:04] <gseguin> I'll investigate later today
[09:12:16] <gseguin> Wilto: back on track
[09:12:29] <gseguin> you've got the latest on that machine

[09:13:37] <Wilto> Awesome. Thanks, dude!
[09:13:52] <Wilto> How do you wanna swing CSS deps?
[09:14:27] <Wilto> Hm. I could manually punch the dependent CSS into each JS file, like “description” and such.
[09:15:18] <Wilto> Actually, that might be case cloased right there. What do you think?
[09:15:29] <gseguin> That's one way
[09:15:55] <gseguin> I wonder if we could use RequireJS for that too
[09:17:23] <gseguin> wait we lost the metadata :(
[09:23:21] * gseguin looks into it
[09:31:52] <gseguin> Wilto: metadata are there but only when you do names=jquery.mobile.page (for instance)
[09:32:35] <gseguin> that kinda sucks doesn't it?
[09:32:52] <Wilto> It do.

[10:29:53] <johnbender> gseguin: yah 2 fixes and a feature in one pull request :D
[10:30:13] <gseguin> and one commit
[10:30:15] <johnbender> gseguin: we just need to ask about the inclusion of the html, I think it might be confusing to devs
[10:30:22] <johnbender> gseguin: I think it's two commits
[10:30:28] <johnbender> but there are two fixes in one commit
[10:30:33] <johnbender> that's fine
[10:30:36] <gseguin> oh, then that's much better
[10:30:46] <johnbender> I've already got the part I want out and committed

[10:32:09] <johnbender> Wilto: yah that's what I figured but he didn't respond to that message which I posted last night
[10:32:16] <Wilto> Something about “being in goddamned Asia” and “seriously Wilto stop bothering me”—I wasn’t really listening.
[10:32:20] <johnbender> Wilto: I figured if you talk to him you could do my pestering for me :)
[10:32:39] <Wilto> No, he’s not feelin’ well. He checked in some fixed stuff this morning, but I imagine we won’t be hearing from him until later tonight.
[10:32:41] <Wilto> I’ll keep an eye out.
[10:33:35] <johnbender> Wilto: ah, bummer :(
[11:01:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/O87z3A
[11:01:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] init whitespace - John Bender
[11:01:18] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #3723 - John Bender
[11:14:31] <Wilto> johnbender: Got a sec to sanity check me?
[11:15:31] <Wilto> johnbender: I changed something in buttonMarkup, which is scary, and in doing so maybe made it quicker? Possibly scarier.
[11:16:00] <Wilto> Well, probably not “quicker,” but removed a potential inefficiency.
[11:18:50] <johnbender> Wilto: yah , link?
[11:19:46] <Wilto> Not pushed yet, for fear. Lemme just bounce the idea off you first:
[11:20:06] <Wilto> We’re currently setting an data-inline="false" attribute on every button.
[11:20:16] <Wilto> a*
[11:20:52] <Wilto> In the headers/footers, buttons default to inline. They’re still getting that attribute, which is a bit weird. I wanted to set it up where specifying data-inline="false" on a header/footer button renders it not inline.
[11:21:29] <Wilto> So instead of us setting data-inline="false" on every button ever, it’s left unspecified. Setting data-inline="true" just sets an appropriate class on there, so no harm done. One less thing to set on elements.
[11:22:40] <Wilto> And I can see if data-inline="false" is explicitly set, and apply a de-inline-ifying class to the element. Which currently makes them block in the headers/footers, but could be useful to have tacked onto explicitly false elements anyway.
[11:22:42] <johnbender> Wilto: well unless someone is expecting that to be there for whatever reason in their code because we've been puting it here
[11:22:45] <johnbender> *there
[11:22:48] <Wilto> Anything in there throw up any flags?
[11:23:34] <Wilto> Oh, hm.
[11:24:03] <johnbender> Wilto: also you can always push a branch to your personal fork
[11:24:12] <johnbender> I do that occasionally
[11:24:36] <Wilto> Get some users’ eyes on this, you think?
[11:26:07] <johnbender> Wilto: I'd just leave it for later, the only thing this does is remove some cruft from the generated markup right?
[11:26:22] <Wilto> Well, inadvertently.
[11:26:53] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3716 got me started on this.
[11:26:53] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3716 on jquery-mobile, reported by bertvh (5d, 9h ago): Buttons not automatically inline in footer
[11:27:22] <Wilto> So, they’re back to being inline, but I realized there was no way to override that without gettin’ one’s !important on.
[11:27:47] <johnbender> Wilto: ah so the original functionality created a bad situation
[11:27:51] <johnbender> which is what you're trying to address
[11:28:07] <Wilto> So I took the same approach as I did to mini, where you could explicitly set it to non-mini and an alternate class is applied.
[11:28:07] <johnbender> Wilto: I'd wait on it, log an issue for it and we can deal with it for 1.2 if you want
[11:28:28] <johnbender> I'd rather just avoid any more possible issues with 1.1
[11:28:41] <johnbender> code change == possible issues
[11:28:45] <johnbender> less code change
[11:28:48] <johnbender> less possible issues
[11:29:03] <johnbender> what do you think?
[11:29:08] <Wilto> Yeah, I hear you.
[11:29:20] <johnbender> Wilto: any chance you could add a test for that fix too :D
[11:29:32] <Wilto> I’m always pretty evenly split between “sneak it under the radar” and “don’t risk it.”
[11:29:56] <Wilto> I’ll chuck it into a branch, for now.
[11:30:00] <johnbender> Wilto: bingo
[11:30:12] <johnbender> Wilto: you know me, always the latter
[11:30:57] <johnbender> featurefull stable software > stable software > unstable featurefull software > unstable software
[11:30:59] <Wilto> I’ve said it before: you serve a vital role, keeping full-speed-ahead folks like Todd and I in check.
[11:31:09] <johnbender> I AM THE WALL
[11:31:25] <Wilto> We are the crash-test dummies.

[12:41:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto created 3716-experiment (+1 new commit): http://git.io/6J73_g
[12:41:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/3716-experiment] Restores default inline behavior to header/footer buttons, but now allows said behavior to be overridden by explicitly specifying “data-inline='false'”. This does mean changing the fact that “data-inline='false'” is attached to all buttons by default, so it bears further testing before being landed in master. - Mat Marquis
[12:41:46] <Wilto> Yes yes Unicode quotes I know.
[12:41:57] <Wilto> “Cold dead hands,” etc.
[13:00:36] <Wilto> johnbender: Any thoughts on how to handle CSS dependencies, with the builder?
[13:02:52] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: how big is our css
[13:03:01] <Wilto> Our CSS is SO BIG…
[13:03:11] <Wilto> I don’t have a punchline there.
[13:03:19] <johnbender> just questioning the effort right now
[13:03:31] <Wilto> I mean, not atrociously huge. I just hate the idea of serving all of it up to everyone, when it’s already set up in a modular way.
[13:03:33] <johnbender> though it makes sense for the future
[13:03:54] <Wilto> I was thinking we could just reference the appropriate stylesheet in the JS files’ metadata.
[13:03:56] <johnbender> Wilto: gseguin: patch require to allow css deps? for a specific build?
[13:03:57] <Wilto> But… Kinda messy.
[13:05:46] * gseguin grabs a coffee and catches up
[13:07:18] <johnbender> gseguin: seems at least semi sane to just add it to the list of dependencies
[13:07:21] <johnbender> maybe a plugin?
[13:07:55] <gseguin> Wilto: how big is my WAT?
[13:09:18] <gseguin> RequireJS has a text! plugin which we could use ... maybe
[13:09:46] <johnbender> gseguin: for builds it has to be a seperate output though right?
[13:10:03] <gseguin> jrburke: any recommendation on how we could link our JS dependencies to our CSS files?
[13:11:17] <jrburke> gseguin: my first thought is to name the css files same name as the JS files, and then after a build, in the built output, it lists the JS files that were used in a build, use that list to build up the list of CSS to build
[13:11:44] <jrburke> but do you want something more? like the JS to load the CSS?
[13:11:49] <gseguin> yup, I was thinking that too
[13:12:05] <gseguin> it's kinda already the case
[13:13:01] <gseguin> no not really just select a bunch of components to bundle
[13:13:09] <gseguin> and build the JS + CSS
[13:13:32] <jrburke> ok yeah, if you wanted...
[13:13:44] <jrburke> with r.js 1.0.7 you can use a onBuildWrite filter...
[13:13:54] <jrburke> scan for a special comment that lists the css it uses
[13:13:57] <jrburke> to build the list
[13:14:12] <jrburke> but i would probably go file path, i like that parity that gives the css and js
[13:14:45] <johnbender> gseguin: hows the builder otherwise?
[13:14:57] <Wilto> Woah, woah, JS loading the CSS?
[13:14:57] <gseguin> jrburke: cool, thanks for your input
[13:15:15] <johnbender> I wouldn't let this prevent us from releasin the js builder by itself
[13:15:17] <gseguin> Wilto: yeah I don't know if we want to go there
[13:15:18] <Wilto> I wouldn’t want to use Require to manage the CSS as well, or anything.
[13:15:27] <gseguin> johnbender: what do you mean?
[13:15:49] <jrburke> Wilto: agreed, on demand css loading is still very uneven, fraught with difficulty
[13:15:54] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm just curious if the reason you guys are talking about it is it's blocking the release of the builder
[13:15:59] <Wilto> Yeah, that stuff gets nightmarish in a hurry.
[13:16:27] <gseguin> johnbender: it's not, right now the builder could work but the css part would be sub optimal
[13:16:40] <johnbender> ship it
[13:16:43] <johnbender> :D
[13:16:44] <Wilto> johnbender: Yeah, all we’re missing on the builder is the grouping by meta thing part.
[13:16:47] <Wilto> ?shipit
[13:16:47] <bot-t> http://wil.to/_/button.gif
[13:17:24] <Wilto> “Grouping by meta thing part.” _Nice_.
[13:18:10] <gseguin> oh yeah, jrburke, what we lost withe the findDependencies thing is being able to do a deep dependency map
[13:19:19] <jrburke> gseguin: what was there before findDependencies that gave a deep map? AFAIK it was just doing a build
[13:20:01] <jrburke> recursive thing with findDependencies would work, but i know it may suck to write that
[13:20:31] <jrburke> although, for this stuff, it is pretty flat
[13:20:53] <jrburke> doing this: https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/tests/tools/uselib/parseDeps.js to get a list of all deps seems ok
[13:20:54] <gseguin> hmm, but I remember being able to call /dependencies on the main module and get a map of all modules and 1 level down dependencies
[13:21:57] * gseguin looks
[13:22:17] <jrburke> so that js will build up hash, each entry is a file name with its direct dependencies
[13:22:26] <jrburke> can use that to walk the graph
[13:22:51] <gseguin> yeah that's what I do
[13:23:00] <jrburke> but i don't recall exposing something that would give the whole tree. well I guess the internal build.traceDependencies would
[13:23:07] <jrburke> but it requires a bit of setup to use
[13:23:57] <gseguin> I think I may have been using that (don't remember for sure though)
[13:24:09] <jrburke> https://github.com/jrburke/r.js/blob/master/build/jslib/build.js#L859 for traceDependencies, but yeah the setup of those module and config objects is a bit esoteric
[13:24:20] <jrburke> so i would suggest using findDependencies instead
[13:24:23] <jrburke> for simplicity
[13:25:21] <gseguin> ok I'll look at it
[13:28:17] <johnbender> Wilto: intentional? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3761
[13:28:18] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3761 on jquery-mobile, reported by marceloverdijk (3h, 18m ago): $.mobile.listview.prototype.options.inset = true; does not work for data-filter=true
[13:28:28] <johnbender> Wilto: http://jsfiddle.net/PvudR/
[13:29:10] <Wilto> Wait, are these two separate things?
[13:29:25] <johnbender> Wilto: the second one is a demonstration of the issue
[13:29:36] <Wilto> Oh, I thought the second one was about busted icons.
[13:29:39] <johnbender> I thought it wasn't intentional until I saw the output
[13:30:12] <Wilto> I’m not certain it is.
[13:30:43] <johnbender> Wilto: well, data-inset=true on the listeview changes it
[13:30:47] <johnbender> so I guess it's a bug

[15:01:03] <gseguin> if you don't specify the name of the module you want the dependencies from then I give you back the dependencies of every js files in the baseUrl directory
[15:01:05] <Wilto> Theeere we go.
[15:03:34] <Wilto> Alright, I’m headed out for the night. I’ll look into that Android select mess tomorrow morning, then I’m gonna try to power through this builder thing once and for all. Barring any incoming issues, of course.
[15:04:13] <Wilto> Thanks, guys!
[15:05:20] <gseguin> see you tomorrow
[15:05:24] <johnbender> Wilto: cool see you tomorrow
[16:23:28] <gseguin> DaveMethvin: ping

[16:24:17] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #3553 - Ghislain Seguin
[16:24:50] <gseguin> hey did we come to an agreement on how we would achieve keeping the execution order of our event handlers ?
[16:25:01] <DaveMethvin> i don't think so
[16:25:31] <gseguin> what is your target for the fix you were talking about ?
[16:25:40] <gseguin> and would that be enough for us?
[16:25:51] <DaveMethvin> it's in 1.7.2, which should be in rc1 being released either tonight or tomorrow
[16:26:11] <DaveMethvin> but it might be easier to use an addEventListener
[16:26:31] <DaveMethvin> since you don't need to worry about vclick events on IE6/7/8
[16:27:09] <gseguin> oh that makes sense
[16:27:50] <DaveMethvin> if you add your listener before core you'll always get first crack at the event
[16:28:36] * gseguin tries it out
[16:29:09] <DaveMethvin> imma run off, i'll ping you when i'm back to see how it went gseguin
[16:29:19] <gseguin> sounds good
[16:29:26] <gseguin> thank you DaveMethvin
[17:15:04] <DaveMethvin> gseguin: howzit going?
[17:15:26] <gseguin> pretty good
[17:15:40] <gseguin> the addEventListener seems to do the trick
[17:15:48] <DaveMethvin> everything went ... better than expected :D
[17:16:20] <gseguin> $( document ).bind( "vclick" => document.addEventListener( $.support.touch?"touchstart":"click"
[17:16:38] <DaveMethvin> looks good. now if you wanted to run AFTER every jQuery handler, that would be harder
[17:16:51] <DaveMethvin> although i have added a hook to do that now in 1.7.2
[17:17:00] <gseguin> setTimeout ?
[17:17:01] <gseguin> :D
[17:17:21] <gseguin> oh cool
[17:17:34] <DaveMethvin> timeouts on events ... shuddre
[17:17:38] <DaveMethvin> shudder even
