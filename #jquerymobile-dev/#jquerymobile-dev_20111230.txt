[09:02:51] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:03:36] <Wilto> Whatup!
[09:03:40] <toddmparker_> morning gseguin
[09:03:45] <Wilto> I see there’s some AMD stuff afoot, sir.
[09:03:59] <gseguin> ya man!
[09:04:21] <gseguin> it's pretty encouraging
[09:04:25] <toddmparker_> yeah, looking good
[09:04:36] <toddmparker_> course i'm sort of clueless until there's a GUI
[09:05:10] <Wilto> People are gonna go berserk for the next couple versions of this sucker.
[09:05:25] <gseguin> toddmparker_: paste this in your browser: http://amd-builder.no.de/amd/make?include=jquery.mobile.page,jquery.mobile.forms.slider
[09:05:47] <toddmparker_> WOAH
[09:05:52] <Wilto> Right!?
[09:06:06] <toddmparker_> that is badass
[09:06:58] <gseguin> The thing I don't know is how much load a no.de Smartmachine can take
[09:07:26] <gseguin> not that it is very intensive CPU wise
[09:07:39] <toddmparker_> right
[09:07:46] <gseguin> but there may be a limit I/O wise
[09:08:33] <gseguin> though I did not see that mentionned anywhere
[09:08:55] <gseguin> I checked the disk space available and there is enough for the next 200yr of jQM release
[09:08:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to fade-out-in-transition: http://git.io/e9W95A
[09:08:59] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/fade-out-in-transition] Shorter fade out (150ms) and fade in (300ms) for speedier transitions. - Todd Parker
[09:09:01] <toddmparker_> so is minification done at some point?
[09:09:03] <gseguin> so we're cool with this
[09:09:13] <Wilto> BUT WILL TWO HUNDRED YEARS BE ENOUGH?
[09:09:37] <gseguin> Wilto: I know! right?
[09:09:50] <toddmparker_> looks great to me. did johnbender check this out yet?
[09:10:02] <gseguin> toddmparker_: just add: &optimize=uglify to that url
[09:10:08] <toddmparker_> ah, cool
[09:10:18] <toddmparker_> there's a param for everything
[09:10:26] <Wilto> Damn.
[09:11:34] <gseguin> toddmparker_: do you have admin rights on jquery-mobile's repo?
[09:11:40] <Wilto> This stuff is huge, gseguin. Awesome work.
[09:11:53] <gseguin> thanks!
[09:12:28] <gseguin> the code is pretty fugly but heh, that'll get better
[09:14:50] <toddmparker_> yeah, can't wait to have a dl builder
[09:15:00] <toddmparker_> but even having AMD is huge
[09:15:35] <gseguin> Can someone whip up a UI for that thing?
[09:16:31] <toddmparker_> i can give it a look and maybe mat can code it up next week
[09:16:42] <Wilto> I am all over it.
[09:16:44] <toddmparker_> what do you envision in terms of fucntionality?
[09:17:04] <Wilto> It’s basically the builder, yeah gseguin? Just a front end that assembles that link from checked-off options?
[09:17:18] <gseguin> yep
[09:17:21] <gseguin> that's it
[09:17:28] <gseguin> a bunch of checkboxes
[09:17:38] <toddmparker_> and how do we deal with showing dependencies?
[09:17:43] <Wilto> ?boom
[09:17:43] <bot-t1> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[09:17:57] <gseguin> :)
[09:18:00] <toddmparker_> if i check off custom select, do we need to ping the server to ask if there are deps?
[09:18:10] <Wilto> I’m not thinking “rip off,” persay, but… http://www.modernizr.com/download/
[09:18:13] <gseguin> yeah so that is going to be a different beast
[09:19:16] <toddmparker_> Wilto: yeah, i like that one
[09:19:26] <toddmparker_> think we'll have 2 levels of hierarchy
[09:19:32] <gseguin> can we have a dumb version first?
[09:19:34] <Wilto> Core and widget-y stuff.
[09:19:41] <Wilto> ?
[09:19:59] <gseguin> one that doesn't show dependencies on the GUI
[09:20:05] <toddmparker_> i mean that we may have listview and if you check it, we might reveal the filter, auto dividers, etc.
[09:20:12] <gseguin> because for that I need to write more code
[09:20:26] <toddmparker_> sure, we can start simple
[09:20:53] <toddmparker_> but does that mean that if i check something, you may add to it after i hit the download button?
[09:21:18] <Wilto> For now, we could just build something with “required foo, bar, baz” alongside the label.
[09:21:31] <toddmparker_> mat - i think we should really start very close to the moderizer one
[09:21:32] <Wilto> Not that we should ever look to Drupal for inspiration, but that’s how they handle modules.
[09:21:47] <Wilto> s/required/requires
[09:22:05] <toddmparker_> we also need to ask if you want the default theme included (if not, just structure)
[09:22:06] <gseguin> Wilto: not even
[09:22:16] <toddmparker_> and what jQ version: 1.6.4 or 1.7
[09:22:33] <gseguin> I would like that to be entirely automated
[09:22:46] <Wilto> Well, the way things are set up now should be cool with either, yeah?
[09:22:49] <toddmparker_> yeah, we can just have people check what they want
[09:23:10] <toddmparker_> then when they hit the build button, maybe we can check and highlight and deps they need
[09:23:17] <toddmparker_> and show the download button
[09:23:20] <gseguin> but for that I need to write some code that will walk through all the modules and trigger a build of each of them to establish the dependency map
[09:23:26] <toddmparker_> thinking moderizr ui
[09:23:45] <Wilto> Man, this is gonna be cool.
[09:23:48] <toddmparker_> ...for the checkboxes?
[09:23:53] <toddmparker_> gseguin ^^
[09:24:07] <gseguin> for showing the dependencies on the GUI
[09:24:10] <Wilto> Yeah, so we aren’t manually keeping track of dependencies somewhere.
[09:24:15] <Wilto> That’d be a nightmare.
[09:24:23] <toddmparker_> so the build will take care of deps
[09:24:29] <toddmparker_> but we not show it
[09:24:33] <toddmparker_> in the ui
[09:24:34] <gseguin> that's probably what modernizr is doing, isn't it?
[09:24:54] <toddmparker_> maybe
[09:24:58] <toddmparker_> or there aren't deps?
[09:25:09] <Wilto> I’m not sure, gseguin. I can pester Faruk about it—I think that’s his department.
[09:25:41] <gseguin> yeah that be great to see how they did it
[09:25:50] <Wilto> There are deps. I assume they’ve automated the dependency tracking, like gseguin is sayin’.
[09:26:04] <toddmparker_> ok, then let's pick faruk's brain
[09:26:10] <toddmparker_> good idea
[09:29:40] <Wilto> Alright, heads-down for a while or I’m never gonna get anything done.
[09:29:48] <Wilto> Go team: http://wil.to/_/goteamventure.gif
[09:30:39] <gseguin> Same here, let me know what Faruk says or have him come to the chat room and share
[09:30:51] <gseguin> I'll be Jivin' most of the day
[09:31:18] <Wilto> I think he’s on the road this week. I’ll keep you posted.
[09:31:33] <gseguin> oh that's right, I saw the pictures
[09:39:29] <gseguin> toddmparker_, Wilto: any of you guys planning to attend / talk at JSConf.US '12 ?
[09:40:14] <Wilto> I was thinking about it; I know they’re big on “mobile”-themed talks.
[09:42:40] <toddmparker_> we probably should go, no plans yet
