[06:57:32] <toddmparker> Morning
[06:58:34] <arschmitz> morning
[07:03:17] <toddmparker> Hey arschmitz 
[07:03:32] <toddmparker> Looks like a meeting filled day for me
[07:03:42] <arschmitz> fun 
[07:03:53] <arschmitz> so something i want to run by you real quick if you have time
[07:03:56] <toddmparker> Yeeeeah
[07:04:00] <toddmparker> Sure
[07:04:15] <arschmitz> the 502 problems we have been having with test
[07:04:30] <toddmparker> Right 
[07:04:31] <uGoMobi> hey guys
[07:04:34] <arschmitz> iv been talking to gnarf and ryanneufeld about them
[07:04:39] <toddmparker> Hey uGoMobi 
[07:04:44] <arschmitz> hi uGoMobi:
[07:04:53] <toddmparker> Looks like they want to move servers?
[07:04:58] <arschmitz> yes
[07:05:14] <arschmitz> also move to sometihng like http://view.jquery.com
[07:05:17] <toddmparker> Ok with me as long as we can get redirects in
[07:05:31] <toddmparker> Test is everywhere
[07:05:44] <arschmitz> yea
[07:05:58] <arschmitz> the problem right now
[07:06:02] <arschmitz> is test is a proxy
[07:06:15] <arschmitz> and apache is having trouble with the proxy
[07:08:17] <toddmparker> Hmm
[07:08:32] <toddmparker> That's going to break a ton of links
[07:08:41] <arschmitz> yup
[07:09:29] <toddmparker> Any options
[07:09:35] <uGoMobi> now we link to docs&demos of latest stable version like this http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/
[07:09:48] <uGoMobi> can we do http://jquerymobile.com/demos/latest/ ?
[07:09:53] <toddmparker> Sure, mainly in the issue tracker
[07:10:01] <uGoMobi> and redirect /test/ to that folder?
[07:10:03] <toddmparker> Where we have test
[07:10:13] <arschmitz> im thinking do a blanket test redirect
[07:10:26] <arschmitz> anything going to /test/ goes to new home 
[07:10:35] <arschmitz> and not do a perfect page - page redirect
[07:10:39] <toddmparker> Would deep links work too?
[07:10:47] <arschmitz> since whole structure is changeing and old docs going away anyway
[07:10:50] <toddmparker> I see
[07:11:13] <uGoMobi> maybe we have to do redirects for every old page in the docs
[07:11:14] <arschmitz> most current test links will be dead soon either way
[07:11:17] <toddmparker> Right, I'd like to make this switch when we go to the new demos 
[07:11:18] <uGoMobi> to the appropiate new page
[07:11:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker: gnarf was talking about with roll out of new jquerymobile.com
[07:13:34] <arschmitz> im sure we could do a perfect page - page redirect for the most part would just be a lot of work lol
[07:14:12] <uGoMobi> yup, I thank we had about 160 pages
[07:14:21] <uGoMobi> think*
[07:14:26] <arschmitz> and many will go to api not demos
[07:15:05] <uGoMobi> well we could redirect to the page in the widget reference section
[07:15:11] <uGoMobi> which has link to API docs
[07:15:22] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:15:52] <uGoMobi> but you are right some stuff will only come back in new API docs
[07:16:23] <arschmitz> yeah and if its really an api thing even if there is a "close enough" demos page it should probably just go to api lol
[07:18:02] <arschmitz> something like view.jquery.com will be nice though since it will give an easy way to get to different branches
[07:19:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: what would the url be if I want to look at branch other than master?
[07:22:48] <arschmitz> not sure but thats the beauty lol it gives you a menu! you dont have to know any more lol
[07:23:15] <arschmitz> but i just tried and it looks like it would be view.jquerymobile.com/branch-name
[07:24:53] <gnarf> arschmitz: i was thinking about your directory tree issue
[07:25:04] <arschmitz> gnarf: yeah?
[07:25:11] <gnarf> we could redirect the root of the tree to the demos/test/whatever folder
[07:25:24] <arschmitz> ok
[07:25:59] <arschmitz> gnarf: there is an index.html in the root already
[07:26:10] <gnarf> is it useful, or wrong? :)
[07:26:29] <arschmitz> so if there is an index.html there wouldnt it actually just work automaticly and not display the file tree to start?
[07:26:52] <arschmitz> gnarf: so actually no need for anything special?
[07:28:40] <gnarf> awesome, i like that
[07:28:53] <gnarf> i might play with the php pools on the swarm machine today
[07:29:11] <gnarf> see if i can't make the 502 issue go away
[07:29:13] <arschmitz> gnarf: i didnt think about that when we talked yesterday and i mentioned the showing of the file tree
[07:29:18] <arschmitz> gnarf: awesome
[07:29:43] <arschmitz> gnarf: one concern we had was redirecting everything from /test/ to the new location
[07:30:12] <arschmitz> but that should be pretty easy right we will just have to make a massive list of the redirects?
[07:30:41] <arschmitz> links to /test/ are everywhere in our issues and dont want to kill them all
[07:34:01] <toddmparker> guess when we switch to the new demo format, we're going to break a lot of links anyway. some pages are combined, others are now in the API site
[07:34:39] <toddmparker> so maybe even just pointing jquerymobile.com/test/* to view.jquerymobile.com/master/ would be ok
[07:35:10] <toddmparker> not ideal, but all the blog posts point to snapshots of specific demos builds so those will be ok
[07:35:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker: yeah id be ok with that to i think as long as we get them to the right ballpark lol
[07:35:30] <gseguin> good morning folks
[07:35:36] <arschmitz> morning gseguin
[07:36:40] <toddmparker> hey gseguin 
[07:37:45] <uGoMobi> morning gseguin 
[07:38:23] <gseguin> any major issue with RC1?
[07:41:23] <toddmparker> Not that I've seen gseguin 
[07:41:39] <toddmparker> anyone see an issue come in that was critical enough to fix before final?
[07:44:27] <gseguin> *crickets*
[07:44:35] * gseguin loves crickets 
[07:44:37] <arschmitz> just a sec
[07:44:44] <arschmitz> i think i saw a potential one
[07:44:55] <arschmitz> but have not been able to look close enough yet
[07:44:59] <gseguin> DAMMIT arschmitz !
[07:45:09] <arschmitz> hoping its nothing lol
[07:45:25] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5593
[07:45:47] <gseguin> it says "showstopper" on it
[07:45:51] <gseguin> must be one
[07:46:08] <arschmitz> lol
[07:48:32] <arschmitz> oh damn thats bad!
[07:48:50] <arschmitz> it really is adding hidden inputs every time you click an input lol
[07:50:44] <toddmparker> what the...
[07:50:51] <toddmparker> that should be fixed
[07:50:58] <arschmitz> yup
[07:51:22] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: this one is minor, right? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5588
[07:51:47] * uGoMobi toddmparker: yes, very minor change
[07:52:11] <uGoMobi> just didn't want to commit directly because we are at RC
[07:52:17] <arschmitz> toddmparker: i wonder if _|Nix|_: popup fix has gone bad
[07:52:35] <arschmitz> the fouce restriction adds hidden inputs and thats a recent change
[07:52:38] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: right, that can wait
[07:53:00] <toddmparker> but it seems to be going crazy and adding inputs all over the place
[07:53:07] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:53:14] <arschmitz> something has gone very wrong somewhere
[07:53:18] * uGoMobi toddmparker: I am in favor of merging before 1.3 final because it's an ugly bug
[07:53:34] <gseguin> arschmitz: that is really weird
[07:53:56] * uGoMobi just didn't want to do it without consulting the team
[07:54:19] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/1eadca872e004508f422646f2dac8e74b64ad80e
[07:56:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker: gseguin: i think thats the culprit ^^
[08:01:01] <arschmitz> its adding a hidden input on vclick if the element has a name and isnt a button or reset
[08:15:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ are you around??
[08:19:59] <toddmparker> arschmitz: looks like it
[08:20:32] <arschmitz> yeah i want to talk to _|Nix|_: before making any changes though
[08:20:37] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: seems like we need to fix this input bug so if this is bad, we can merge.
[08:20:50] <toddmparker> i really want to keep changes to an absolute minimum
[08:21:03] <arschmitz> make sure we dont break what _|Nix|_: was fixing
[08:21:04] <toddmparker> we may need to do another RC if we make more changes
[08:21:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[08:21:22] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I understand
[08:21:51] <arschmitz> this hidden input thing i think i would call a blocker though
[08:22:03] <arschmitz> :(
[08:37:20] <toddmparker> so is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5592
[08:37:24] <toddmparker> a dupe of ...
[08:37:43] <toddmparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5593
[08:38:02] <arschmitz> yes
[08:38:09] <toddmparker> ok, thought so
[08:38:49] <toddmparker> ok, closed 5592
[08:45:02] <arschmitz> i think https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/1eadca872e004508f422646f2dac8e74b64ad80e#L0R993 should just be if( type === "submit" && name )

[10:01:15] <johnbender> toddmparker: tech cabal?
[11:27:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[11:28:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We need to move that out of button and into the nav click handler, because otherwise you cannot submit forms via ajax if the submit button was not enhanced.
[11:29:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I mean, you can submit them, but the value of the submit button will be missing, because the add-hidden-input logic is confined to enhanced buttons.
[11:31:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5593 now ...
[11:31:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The field is supposed to be removed, but lemme see ...
[11:34:51] <_|Nix|_> OK. Reproduced.
[11:38:53] <arschmitz> toddmparker: _|Nix|_ : uGoMobi : johnbender : agcolom : gseguin : RWhitbeck : anyone else I forgot my wife's water broke we are heading to hospital not sure when I'll be around next.
[11:39:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Good luck!
[11:40:05] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Thanks!
[11:49:24] <_|Nix|_> I think I have a fix for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5593, but I think I'll check in core to make sure I got all possible submit-scenarios covered ...
[11:51:15] <agcolom> arschmitz: Congratulations! Hope all goes well!!!!! 
[12:02:03] <toddmparker> Good luck arschmitz!!
[12:04:00] <arschmitz> Thanks we are at hospital now!
[12:23:43] <gseguin> arschmitz: good luck!
[12:27:19] <johnbender> arschmitz: congrats and good luck!
[12:28:55] <arschmitz> gseguin: johnbender : thank you both
[12:33:19] <gseguin> rxaviers: did you get my comments on IM ?
[12:33:27] <rxaviers> I havent
[12:33:50] <gseguin> grrrr.... DAMMIT Google Talk!
[12:34:10] <rxaviers> rrsrs
[13:17:48] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I think I got https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5593 fixed ...
[13:32:20] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Yea?
[13:35:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... no more hidden input.
[13:35:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Don't you have more important things to do? ;)
[13:35:46] <arschmitz> Lol not yet 
[13:35:51] <agcolom> What is going on at the office in Boston?? 
[13:36:27] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_:  nothing going on yet and I'm just on my phone
[13:37:06] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. So you don't create a hidden input. You record the element that was clicked during vclick, and during submit you check if it belongs to the current form, and if so, you check whether it has a name, and if so, you check whether it's already included in the serialized data, and if not, you include it by hand before handing off the data to changePage.
[13:37:29] <arschmitz> Sounds good
[13:37:47] <arschmitz> A lot less potential for major problems 
[13:38:03] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep - just yanked out the unit test that checks for hidden inputs. There's one more nav test that needs some love, and then it should be golden.
[13:38:18] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. The guys in core were really helpful.
[13:38:41] <arschmitz> It was nutty watching the hidden inputs blow up  on every click
[13:38:48] <Wilto> agcolom: Todd is making fun of himself for DM-failing the address to someone.
[13:39:04] <Wilto> So his feed has become @oldmansearch
[13:39:26] <agcolom> oh! 
[13:40:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, they weren't doing that before I moved the code from button to the vclick handler.
[13:40:11] <agcolom> btw have you noticed how our favicon is close to BB? (but our one stands out more clearly I find...)
[13:40:20] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The problem is that the vclick handler has a much wider scope than the button widget.
[13:40:27] <arschmitz> It's because you didn't check the element just if t had a name
[13:40:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[13:40:47] <arschmitz> So any element with a name that wasent a button or reset
[13:40:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I actually copied the check straight from button.
[13:41:04] <arschmitz> Yeah that would do it
[13:41:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... but I failed to realize that I need a much tighter check.
[13:41:25] <arschmitz> Yup
[13:41:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So tight, in fact, that a hidden input is to be avoided altogether :)
[13:41:49] <arschmitz> Honest mistake 
[13:41:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... NP ...
[13:42:00] <arschmitz> But was a blocker on rc for sure lol
[13:42:04] <_|Nix|_> For sure ...
[13:44:58] <Wilto> arschmitz man what are you doing here
[13:45:10] <arschmitz> Loo
[13:45:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: BTW: http://babulina.go-nix.ca:8080/nix/tmp/jqm/docs/demos/demos/popups/arrow.html
[13:45:23] <Wilto> If television has taught me anything: you should be alternately passing out cigars and fainting right now.
[13:45:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Too bad I couldn't get it in time for RC ...
[13:46:15] <arschmitz> Wilto: That comes later right now is horsing waiting
[13:46:32] <arschmitz> I don't have cigars....
[13:47:45] <arschmitz> Have a lot of test devices I can hand out old smart phones ?
[13:47:55] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:47:57] <Wilto> Perfect.
[13:48:44] <arschmitz> Came from work so have a zillion devices with me lol
[13:48:53] <_|Nix|_> :)
[13:49:16] <_|Nix|_> I only haul around the three my boss was bearly willing to invest in ...
[13:50:31] <arschmitz> Iv had a lot of donations lol managed to get 2 androids a blackberry and a wp all with out spending a cent
[13:51:21] <Wilto> Woah, nice.

[14:31:37] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: that popup with arrow looks great
[14:32:04] <toddmparker> the right an bottom arrows are a tad too far away from the popup on my retina macbook
[14:32:39] <toddmparker> thanks for that input fix too
[14:36:41] <arschmitz> toddmparker: The old man tweets are very amusing while I wait in hospital
[14:40:10] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: Popup does not work at all on ups 5
[14:40:16] <arschmitz> iOS 
[14:44:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You mean on master, or the popup with an arrow?
[14:45:15] <arschmitz> Popular with arrow
[14:45:19] <arschmitz> Won't open
[14:45:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: oH, ok ... need to check that then ...
[14:45:52] <arschmitz> Damn auto correct
[14:46:00] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Actually, the location is fine, but the background offset and/or clipping is not.
[14:46:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There might be a JS exception on iOS 5 ... too bad I don't have such a device :(
[14:46:47] <arschmitz> I'll turn on console
[14:47:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Man, that's great ... the console is gone in iOS 6 :(
[14:47:38] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: It opens for a sec befoe nav if you click home button
[14:47:43] <arschmitz> Yeah
[14:47:56] <arschmitz> I have Mac so I can link up to safari for 6
[14:48:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah, that's what pisses me off - you have to get a laptop from Apple just to debug iOS ... 
[14:48:43] <arschmitz> I know 
[14:48:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I don't think they even know how to spel interoperability ...
[14:48:58] <arschmitz> I didn't have a Mac till last month and it pissed me off
[14:50:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Theoretically, it's some late version of Safari you need for the link to work. So, if they ever release that version of Safari for Windoze, I'll be able to do it with my Windoze PC ...
[14:51:48] <toddmparker> _|Nix|_: browserstack?
[14:51:48] <arschmitz> Yea they discontinued safari for pc lol
[14:52:19] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: No exceptions
[14:53:04] <_|Nix|_> toddmparker: Can you do JS console with browserstack?
[14:53:32] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: It opens if you tap home button
[14:53:38] <toddmparker> you can turn on the dev toolbar in iOS5 fwiw
[14:54:01] <toddmparker> and they have safari on os x
[14:54:29] <arschmitz> I turned it on nothing there
[14:59:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Looking at browserstack ... nice ... I can see the problem.
[15:00:03] <arschmitz> Cool
[15:00:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll throw some console.log at it ... but for now, I'll concentrate on reducing the code ...
[15:00:31] <arschmitz> Cool
[15:01:30] <toddmparker> nice
[15:01:35] <toddmparker> alright, i need to head home
[15:02:01] <_|Nix|_> Funny - browserstack has a popup with an arrow :)
[15:02:08] <toddmparker> good luck arschmitz - you probably have another 12-24 hours before go time if things go down like they do first time
[15:02:14] <toddmparker> steal that _|Nix|_ 
[15:02:23] <toddmparker> heading home, be on later
