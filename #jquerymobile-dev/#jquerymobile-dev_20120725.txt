[01:16:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Weren't the photos done with position-to="window"?
[01:17:25] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... they are ...
[01:17:32] <_|Nix|_> Why isn't that working ... ?
[01:17:48] * _|Nix|_ thinks he's found a büg ...
[01:26:05] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ... "positoin" ... definitely a büg :)
[02:06:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: need help, or think you can solve it ;)
[02:33:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I got it.
[02:33:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok :D
[02:35:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I also added some console logs to the resize logic, and I have found that, when you have a fixed width popup on the screen like the menu or the dialog, when you go to landscape and it doesn't zoom (sometimes it does, sometimes it doesn't) and then you go back to portrait, you get two resize events - the first one has a position scrollLeft() (!) and the second one has a scrollLeft() of 0.
[02:35:22] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: programmatically opening popups works fine... as expected I made a mistake in the code
[02:35:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's this first resize that causes the truncation.
[02:35:55] <_|Nix|_> s/a position/a positive/
[02:36:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I tested with an alert and I always got two alerts
[02:36:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: YOu tested the resize thing with an alert?
[02:37:51] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes because I was curious if the issue with the popup being too small would be gone if I was holding up the process with an alert
[02:38:15] <uGoMobi> that wasn't the case BTW
[03:11:59] <agcolom> Good morning :-)
[03:14:43] <uGoMobi> morning Anne
[03:17:58] <agcolom> good morning Jasper :-) It's already boiling hot here!
[03:18:05] <agcolom> crazy weather!
[03:18:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can we make the reposition function take the x,y coordinates into account?
[03:18:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: see this example... http://jsbin.com/apaboj/1
[03:19:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I use "popupbeforeposition" to set the size, but on resize the x,y coordinates are lost
[03:19:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just asking :D
[03:19:48] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it's crazy hot here
[03:20:04] <agcolom> nice demo!
[03:20:15] <agcolom> I like it ;-)
[03:21:30] <uGoMobi> thanks
[03:21:30] <agcolom> This summer I am going to the south of France where it''ll be even hotter but at least the house is better insulated and there's a swimming pool! Here, it's already 26 inside! (problem of having a house from 1898!)
[03:21:58] <uGoMobi> agcolom: all the time you were complaining about the rain and now it is too hot? ;-)
[03:22:34] <agcolom> I know, I like the sun and hot weather, it's just those stupid victorian houses are not good for it ;-)
[03:23:42] <agcolom> I love this weather ;-) and I am glad I am not traveling on the underground this week!
[03:26:21] <uGoMobi> yeah the underground is the place to be when it's hot... certainly not during rush hour
[03:27:38] <uGoMobi> Firefox is releasing updates quite often... I think I had 13 for just a few weeks and now it's updating to 14
[03:29:38] <agcolom> yes, I'm still on 13, but also got the message to update to 14. So if everything works, that's something to add to the blog. I just tested you popup on the ipod touch, and it looks very nice!
[03:31:50] <uGoMobi> :D
[07:25:37] <toddparker> hi all
[07:27:44] <toddparker> i really like that demo uGoMobi created
[07:28:02] <uGoMobi> hi toddparker
[07:28:02] <toddparker> it's good to really push on a widget and try to build soemthign custom
[07:28:04] <uGoMobi> thanks
[07:28:09] <toddparker> we found a few small issues already
[07:28:21] <toddparker> gseguin: are you on jQM today?
[07:28:29] <toddparker> hi agcolom and _|Nix|_
[07:29:56] <agcolom> Hi toddparker
[07:30:23] <uGoMobi> toddparker: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/6c16e18234c3f224160ea3b3520854d0f00d0d87
[07:30:24] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Anne-Gaelle Colom (19h, 7m ago): Docs: removed data-position-to from popup as belongs to Anchor with data-rel="popup" (docs/api/data-attributes.html)
[07:30:32] <uGoMobi> what's the verdict? :)
[07:31:03] <uGoMobi> are we going to advertise you can use data-position-to and data-transition on the popup itself as well?
[07:32:41] <uGoMobi> if so, how? a note, or listing them below both sections under Popup or create a new section for data-attr. that can be used on both
[07:33:28] <uGoMobi> I am cleaning up (consistency mostly) the data attribute reference right now
[07:35:48] <gseguin> toddparker: kind of
[07:36:27] <gseguin> moving truck is delivering, so I can do stuff but will get interrupted
[07:50:53] <toddparker> ok gseguin
[07:51:06] <toddparker> just wondering if you had time to look at those list view filter tweaks
[07:51:08] <toddparker> for 1.2

[08:54:55] <uGoMobi> toddparker: did you see this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2855#issuecomment-7251782 ?
[08:54:56] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2855 on jquery-mobile (jblas; 8m, 4w ago): Improve scrolling performance.
[09:06:48] <johnbender> toddparker: scott_gonzalez: we should only really be generating the plugin manifests for widgets and possibly button markup eh?
[09:07:44] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: Anything that would be useful.
[09:08:23] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: the rest of the stuff is just options for plugins or dependencies
[09:08:47] <scott_gonzalez> Things like events are useful.
[09:14:51] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: to make this easier can we just put a blanket "mobile.jquery" dependency in there?
[09:15:25] <scott_gonzalez> ?
[09:15:38] <johnbender> for the dependencies
[09:15:44] <scott_gonzalez> What does that even mean?
[09:15:48] <scott_gonzalez> mobile.jquery?
[09:16:02] <johnbender> "this depends on the library jquery mobile as a whole"
[09:16:17] <johnbender> if the goal is discovery, then we should be directing them to our builder/downloads page
[09:16:29] <johnbender> knowing the specific deps won't help t hem
[09:16:30] <scott_gonzalez> johnbender: That's unrelated to dependencies.
[09:17:04] <johnbender> well, it's related in that I don't have to enumerate the dependencies and then cross reference that with the selection of things for which we've chosen to create a manifest file
[09:17:08] <scott_gonzalez> Perhaps you should have a "mobile core" if that's what everything actually depends on.
[09:17:43] <johnbender> I think that's the same idea
[09:18:06] <johnbender> a blanket dep that covers "everything else"
[09:18:42] <scott_gonzalez> FWIW, dependencies don't need to exist on the plugins site.
[09:19:07] <scott_gonzalez> It's valid to have a "foo" plugin which depends on "bar" even if "bar" isn't on the plugins site.
[09:19:18] <johnbender> ah
[09:19:31] <scott_gonzalez> So if that was your only concern, it's not an issue :-)
[09:19:35] <johnbender> indeed
[09:19:37] <johnbender> :D
[09:19:46] * johnbender gets back to work
[09:20:14] <scott_gonzalez> If you just don't want all the underlying utilities listed because you don't think people would find them useful on the site, that's fine.
[09:20:24] <johnbender> that's my thinking
[09:20:33] <johnbender> they aren't plugins and it would just be confusing
[09:20:56] <scott_gonzalez> ok, that's fine
[09:59:24] <toddparker> uGoMobi: i saw that thread on scrolling
[09:59:38] <toddparker> it's complicated. seems like things are bad in cordova especially
[09:59:50] <toddparker> but in combination with events like swipe and android
[10:00:00] <toddparker> a stew of badness
[10:02:10] <uGoMobi> hmm :(
[10:02:40] <toddparker> are you and _|Nix|_ looking at those items we discussed?
[10:03:02] <uGoMobi> I just opened tickets
[10:03:09] <toddparker> cool
[10:04:05] <uGoMobi> I am now checking if I can a reverse transition to work

[10:34:37] <toddparker> as we're discussing
[10:34:47] <johnbender> toddparker: nope

[10:35:10] <johnbender> just have to include it
[10:35:23] <toddparker> who hard to add this?
[10:39:07] <agcolom> johnbender: thanks!
[10:39:49] <tbranyen> here we go
[10:40:42] <tbranyen> was wondering why none of the devs were in #jquerymobile
[10:40:47] <tbranyen> at least there is a -dev room
[10:48:10] <tbranyen> i've been trying to use jquery mobile for a *long* time with backbone, layoutmanager, and requirejs and it does not cooperate
[10:48:21] <tbranyen> since i need to make fundamental changes to the library, i figured this would be a good place to discuss them
[10:48:26] <tbranyen> either i can start firing off pull requests
[10:55:08] <toddparker> tbranyen: we'd love to hear what you think
[10:55:38] <toddparker> I think the best approach would be for you to create issues in the tracker for specific pain points, then create PRs against them
[10:55:40] <tbranyen> toddparker: cool, i'd like to get involved.  best way is probably submitting pull req
[10:55:43] <tbranyen> yeah
[10:55:56] <toddparker> IRC isn't a great format for complex conversations
[10:56:09] <toddparker> but it would be great to have you involved
[10:56:10] <tbranyen> especially since you can't paste code in here
[10:56:38] <toddparker> yeah. once there are issues and PRs, it's feasible to then chat about ti here
[10:56:49] <toddparker> things just get lost here
[10:57:14] <toddparker> but the backbone use case is important so if you have ideas on how to improve things, we're all ears
[10:57:31] <tbranyen> yeah, i think my big issue right now is how to avoid losing my styling
[10:58:32] <toddparker> one big topic i'd like to tackle is how to let you generate pre-decorated markup so you don't need to deal with create/refresh
[10:58:44] <tbranyen> yeah that'd be great
[10:58:49] <toddparker> which i'm guessing is part of your issue
[10:58:55] <tbranyen> my issue is also that there is no way to know if the page has been initialized yet
[10:58:58] <tbranyen> or already initialized
[10:59:03] <toddparker> we keep the markup clean and minimal for folks authoring html and for PE
[10:59:13] <tbranyen> so i can't conditionally say whether or not to initializePage() or changePage()
[10:59:16] <toddparker> but when generating markup with JS, it's a different story
[10:59:23] <toddparker> i see
[10:59:35] <tbranyen> i don't think many application developers will be generating markup on the server tbqh
[10:59:38] <toddparker> tbranyen - You're Tim from Bocoup?
[10:59:39] <tbranyen> breaks the whole offline-app idea
[10:59:40] <tbranyen> toddparker: yea
[10:59:44] <toddparker> cool
[10:59:49] <toddparker> yeah
[11:00:05] <toddparker> if you have time to dig in and help us look at this stuff, it would be great
[11:00:28] <tbranyen> yeah def, its better than whining about it :-p
[11:00:47] <toddparker> cool
[11:00:52] <tbranyen> http://tbranyen.com:8000/ is what i have so far
[11:01:06] <tbranyen> resizing should dynamically swap my layout (which it does) along with losing all my styles
[11:01:07] <toddparker> tell Boaz you need to hunker down an work on jQM for a while
[11:01:10] <tbranyen> haha
[11:01:30] <tbranyen> sucks i'm on a 12 week project atm, but i want to focus my efforts on getting a solid jqm+backbone boilerplate app together
[11:01:53] <toddparker> there are a few floating around, no?
[11:02:06] <tbranyen> none that i've seen
[11:02:11] <toddparker> i haven't looked into them much but I RT 'em
[11:02:41] <toddparker> there are some here: http://jquerymobile.com/resources
[11:03:28] <toddparker> http://coenraets.org/blog/2012/03/using-backbone-js-with-jquery-mobile/
[11:03:37] <johnbender> toddparker: there is much work ahead :( http://swarm.jquery.org/job/376
[11:03:41] <tbranyen> right i've seen that, its a very poor implementation imo
[11:03:54] <tbranyen> like high level
[11:03:59] <tbranyen> not real world
[11:04:11] <toddparker> i see
[11:04:26] <toddparker> https://github.com/Filirom1/jquery-mobile-backbone-requirejs
[11:05:06] <tbranyen> like one of the problems i'm seeing here is that the *entire* page is re-rendered per route
[11:05:19] <tbranyen> the layout should remain teh same and only changed regions should be updated
[11:05:38] <tbranyen> hrm that last link is 404ing for me
[11:05:39] <toddparker> that can be done by updating parts of the page
[11:05:53] <tbranyen> right thats what backbone.layoutmanager does
[11:06:21] <tbranyen> and it simply breaks down, because initializePage styles everything initially, and changePage styles afterwards
[11:06:33] <tbranyen> but for some reason changePage does not work well with the exact same page element
[11:06:50] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Mobile TestSwarm Master build #44: FAILURE in 8 min 35 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20TestSwarm%20Master/44/
[11:06:59] <tbranyen> i'm reusing the same page element, just changing content inside it
[11:07:00] <toddparker> if you can post up some test pages and descriptions into issues, that would be really helpful
[11:07:04] <tbranyen> yeah
[11:07:12] <tbranyen> any idea why your last link 404'd?
[11:07:21] <tbranyen> i'd love to see a working requirejs impl that doesn't involve patching jqm
[11:07:26] <tbranyen> i had to do that in my application
[11:07:30] <toddparker> this one? https://github.com/Filirom1/jquery-mobile-backbone-requirejs
[11:07:59] <tbranyen> weird it was 404ing before, all good now
[11:08:02] <tbranyen> this internet is shoddy
[11:08:06] <toddparker> johnbender: that test swarm result
[11:08:16] <toddparker> github can be flaky tbranyen
[11:08:52] <toddparker> that broke with the directory change?
[11:08:59] <tbranyen> yeah this requirejs example has all the pages already in the DOM
[11:09:01] <tbranyen> at page load
[11:09:09] <johnbender> toddparker: yah, I have to address the ie issues
[11:09:09] <toddparker> cheating
[11:09:16] <johnbender> then once that's done I'll add the mobile browsers
[11:09:31] <toddparker> ok
[11:09:45] <toddparker> let me know if you need mat to look at any IE oddness for you
[11:09:59] <johnbender> I will
[11:10:08] <johnbender> it's all JS stuff so I should be able to sort it
[11:10:13] <toddparker> ok, cool
[11:10:18] <tbranyen> also this example uses the mobile router :-/ man there is so much overlap
[11:10:24] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: are you around?
[11:10:25] <tbranyen> does jqm need a router?
[11:10:42] <tbranyen> i guess the point of jqm is to be completely standalone
[11:10:43] <johnbender> we have one that needs abstracting :(
[11:10:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I am around.
[11:11:02] <johnbender> tbranyen: we're trying to get away from that, we want to provide the useful bits
[11:11:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4741 : That's the intended behaviour.
[11:11:06] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4741 on jquery-mobile (uGoMobi; 1h, 11m ago): Popup: x,y coordinates disregarded on repositioning
[11:11:14] <toddparker> johnbender and tbranyen - that is an area we should look at again
[11:11:29] <johnbender> toddparker: pulling out the PE coverage of routing shouldn't be too hard
[11:11:31] <toddparker> not that we need to take it on
[11:11:37] <toddparker> yeah?
[11:11:42] <johnbender> yeah
[11:11:42] <toddparker> encouraging.
[11:11:53] <johnbender> the page management stuff is separate
[11:11:59] <toddparker> cool
[11:12:07] <tbranyen> i think my first big push is to be able to stop autoInitializePage earlier
[11:12:08] <johnbender> pushstate + _handleHashChange
[11:12:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We agreed that, upon orientationchange, we center wrt. the window, because it would be too complicated to possibly scroll the origin into view and then center over it again.
[11:12:13] <toddparker> we can add this to the roadmap
[11:12:19] <tbranyen> right now when i build with requirejs its impossible to stop the page from initializing
[11:12:24] <tbranyen> without modifying the core
[11:12:45] <tbranyen> i've talked with gnarf about this before
[11:12:52] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: that's true. forgot about that
[11:13:03] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[11:13:15] <toddparker> guess that means we just need to note that on the demo page
[11:13:42] <toddparker> guess uGoMobi could bind to orientation change and hide/show the popup again?
[11:14:05] <toddparker> tbranyen: that would be a good one to look at
[11:14:24] <toddparker> if you can log these and flag the mod important roadblocks, we can prioritize
[11:14:37] <tbranyen> yeah i'm just thinking openly in here :-p
[11:14:41] <tbranyen> i'll definitely file them
[11:14:42] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yeah I think so but that means you see the close and open transition again
[11:16:01] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: toddparker : this also means that setting x,y coordinate on open is not very useful
[11:16:21] <uGoMobi> because it will always break on orientation change
[11:17:02] <uGoMobi> but I understand the issue with "origin"
[11:17:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: No. The point is that the popup opening makes sense. If you change orientation, we have no choice but to sacrifice the "link" between the popup and its origin.
[11:17:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What it you don't change orientation?
[11:17:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It looks and feels great!
[11:17:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The point of the popup is not to stay on the screen for too long, anyway.
[11:18:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and to prevent the user from doing anything else while its there.
[11:18:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, I agree that x,y is still useful if you don't change orientation
[11:19:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IMO, changing orientation is not a major usecase for popup. The only place where I can think of that being useful is images.
[11:19:22] <uGoMobi> I should rephrase it... you should not use it to make attach the popup to an edge
[11:19:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes that is true
[11:20:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't understand "to make attach the popup to an edge".
[11:20:53] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I wouldn't understand either ;-)   I messed up that line
[11:21:11] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Should we convert the arguments to popup's open() into a hash? i.e., .popup( "open", {x: xValue, y: yValue, transition: "fade", positionTo: "a:nth(3)" } )?
[11:21:40] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: anyway... what I mean is that I used the x,y to make the popup stick to one edge of the screen
[11:21:46] <uGoMobi> hope that is more clear :)
[11:21:49] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: It may be more useful that way, if you want to specify, for example, the positionTo, but not the x, y, and not the transition.
[11:22:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think that's fine. We can still do, like, dropdown combos with popups, and we can still align them with buttons and stuff. This only breaks if the popup is on the screen for a long time, and you accidentally rotate your phone.
[11:23:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and even then, we do the right thing, because we make sure the popup is still visible, so the user can complete whatever short action has turned into a long action because of an interruption IRL.
[11:24:44] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok... I agree the most important thing is that content is always visible
[11:24:46] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I found myself wondering why this: $( "#popupBasic" ).popup( "open", undefined, undefined, "a:nth(5)" ); causes all popups to break. Well, I realized that I was asking the popup to perform the transition "a:nth(5)" ...
[11:25:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: This could've been avoided with an options-style hash, like { positionTo: "a:nth(5)" } ...
[11:27:40] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Currently, the arguments to open() look like this: ( x, y, transition, positionTo )
[11:28:08] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: So, if you want to specify only the positionTo, you need to do this: undefined, undefined, undefined, "origin"
[11:33:13] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I have an idea
[11:33:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: By all means - share with the group.
[11:33:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we talked about including the margin, right?
[11:33:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, instead of using tolerances.
[11:34:08] <uGoMobi> the only problem was that .css() returned 0 on FF if you set margin auto
[11:34:39] <uGoMobi> but auto means you want it to be centered anyway so that is not really a problem
[11:35:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I will not replicate CSS parsing code that has already been written once - in the browser. That's a very, very slippery slope.
[11:35:34] <uGoMobi> so if we can take margins into account when positioning the popup, I can make the container stick at one side without setting x,y
[11:35:42] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I almost made that mistake with the screen resizing thing. Wilto was right to have me yank it.
[11:36:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see
[11:36:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Look, I'll do it, but I don't consider it an elegant solution.
[11:37:37] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: nah, let's wait and see if we can think of other solutions
[11:37:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: If we had a way of position the origin for the popup's coordinate system at the top left corner of the margin-box, we'd have this working in 3.7992 seconds.
[11:37:41] <tbranyen> Uncaught cannot call methods on listview prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'
[11:37:51] <tbranyen> this kind of stuff weirds me out
[11:38:01] <tbranyen> instead of throwing an error, why doesn't jqm just initialize it for me
[11:38:21] <_|Nix|_> tbranyen: It thinks it has.

[11:42:38] <tbranyen> not the best title
[11:42:43] <tbranyen> _|Nix|_: but you can see the issue there
[11:45:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4740 - what do you think about "<id>-popup"?
[11:45:34] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4740 on jquery-mobile (uGoMobi; 1h, 52m ago): Popup: generate an ID for the container
[11:46:17] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: While we're at it, I can set the screen ID to <id>-screen ...
[11:46:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The problem is, I don't like generating IDs, because they may be unexpectedly non-unique.
[11:47:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: screen not having an idea is not a problem
[11:47:28] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: true on IDs but i think we can make these mor eunique if worried
[11:47:39] <toddparker> jqm-overlay-[id]
[11:47:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes, there is always a risk
[11:47:57] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: What do you think about making the arguments to open() into a hash?
[11:48:10] <toddparker> was just catching up _|Nix|_
[11:48:16] <uGoMobi> but if we mention it in the docs devs can avoid that
[11:48:18] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK, cool.
[11:48:26] <toddparker> i think that's a nicer syntax if you're only setting one or a few
[11:48:52] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Exactly, you don't have to hop over the first three params just to set the fourth.
[11:48:55] <toddparker> yeah, we can and should explain that stuff better
[11:49:13] <toddparker> in fact i wouldn't mind showing how we wrap and decorate markup on that page
[11:49:21] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: OK - I have a branch ready that does the hashifying.
[11:49:28] <toddparker> cool
[11:49:28] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Shall I merge it?
[11:49:41] <toddparker> did johnbender or gseguin weigh in at all?
[11:49:48] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Nop.
[11:49:48] <toddparker> uGoMobi: you seem to like that idea?
[11:50:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: What do you think about placing the args for popup's open() into a hash?
[11:50:09] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ^
[11:50:17] <uGoMobi> toddparker: the hash you mean?
[11:50:22] <toddparker> ya
[11:50:55] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... to avoid things like .open( undefined /* x */, undefined /* y */, undefined /* transition */, "window" /* positionTo */ )
[11:51:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ^
[11:51:16] <uGoMobi> yeah I would like it a lot
[11:52:13] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: The open() call would start to look a lot like the create call, except that open would only take the temporary-override options, whereas the create call would accept all options.
[11:52:48] <_|Nix|_> .popup( { theme: "a", overlayTheme: "b", transition: "flip" });
[11:52:58] <toddparker> right
[11:53:02] <toddparker> like it
[11:53:03] <_|Nix|_> .popup( "open", { transition: "slide", positionTo: "window" });
[11:53:21] <uGoMobi> yeah, makes thing more consistent with other widgets
[11:53:38] <uGoMobi> and I am always in favor of that :)
[11:53:55] <toddparker> indeed
[11:54:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I was trying to do it that way by accident yesterday
[11:54:14] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: johnbender was saying earlier that, in general, any function that has a number of arguments in excess of 4 or 5 should have those arguments turned into a hash.
[11:54:24] <uGoMobi> just because I am used to it from other widgets
[11:54:50] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, the creation is like that, but widget methods have no such convention.
[11:55:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Like, say, .slider( "refresh" ) ...
[11:55:18] <toddparker> if bender was already arguing that, then i don't think he'd have an issue here
[11:55:24] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: IIRC, that method accepts two arguments.
[11:55:36] <agcolom> Hi, been discussing jsbin with Remy today. jsbin is now working with jQuery Mobile (live output) (i still have an issue with FF13), but all ok with Safari. Just check the JS box on the output panel
[11:55:41] <uGoMobi> right
[11:55:48] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Well, we can always revert, if anything ...
[11:55:53] <toddparker> agcolom: awesome, thanks for following up on that
[11:55:54] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'll push that.
[11:56:00] <toddparker> ok _|Nix|_
[11:56:06] <uGoMobi> nice _|Nix|_
[11:56:17] <toddparker> agcolom: how do you save a version on the new 'bin?
[11:56:25] <toddparker> i was confused
[11:56:30] <toddparker> do you need to log in?
[11:56:35] <agcolom> you can either create a milestone or clone
[11:56:47] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I was confused too
[11:56:47] <agcolom> Yes, you get a lot more if you login
[11:57:25] <agcolom> and you can even preview your saved bins by hovering all your saved bins! REally usefuk
[11:57:30] <uGoMobi> but it is nice that it is now auto updating so you don't have a new version for every tiny change
[11:57:33] <agcolom> useful ^
[11:58:15] <agcolom> yes, I thought someone else was updating as I went along and it was driving me mad until I realised it was a new feature!
[11:58:43] <toddparker> huh. i better login
[11:59:22] <agcolom> yes. Here's a video as well http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDFGrqjjyLk
[11:59:28] <johnbender> toddparker: _|Nix|_ I'd cut that down to three
[11:59:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: that's what I suggested originally
[12:00:26] <johnbender> that is, just using an object literal
[12:00:39] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, it has become even more relevant since we added positionTo ...
[12:01:12] <toddparker> in jsbin, how do you save a version?
[12:01:16] <toddparker> i'm logged in
[12:01:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: js' lack of named arguments really stings ...
[12:01:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Feel free to s/gs/ks/ :)
[12:02:05] <agcolom> ok, under the jsbin menu
[12:02:28] <agcolom> create milestone
[12:03:11] <toddparker> buried, huh
[12:03:16] <agcolom> but if you edit it it will make a new version automatically... but I've read there's a cmd ^ s trick as well...
[12:03:32] <agcolom> but can't remember if it's not to get the auto save... let me check
[12:04:13] <agcolom> the small arrow in the top right corner will take you to the latest version of that bin I  think
[12:04:52] <uGoMobi> that arrow launches the preview in a new tab
[12:04:53] <agcolom> (you need the output panel to see the arrow)
[12:05:30] <agcolom> yes but the preview of the latest version
[12:06:06] <toddparker> tricky
[12:06:14] <toddparker> so…anyone want to look at a few logos?
[12:06:16] <toddparker> http://imgur.com/XVsBM
[12:06:32] <toddparker> just seeing if there is a clear direction for refinement
[12:06:47] <agcolom> nice!!!!
[12:06:56] <johnbender> toddparker: top-right
[12:07:00] <toddparker> concept is multiple devices/screens converging, little abstract but we're in hazy time
[12:07:05] <uGoMobi> yeah logos!
[12:07:14] <toddparker> who wants a t-shirt
[12:07:20] <agcolom> me :-)
[12:07:23] <agcolom> please ;-)
[12:07:34] <_|Nix|_> Me too, please!
[12:07:34] <uGoMobi> second one at the first row is nice
[12:07:36] <toddparker> once we have a logo, schwag will flow
[12:07:45] <toddparker> uGoMobi: upper right?
[12:07:53] <uGoMobi> yes
[12:07:53] <agcolom> My least favorite one is bottom left
[12:08:17] <toddparker> agcolom: you most favorite is...
[12:08:32] <agcolom> my favourite ones are top right and bottom right
[12:08:39] <toddparker> mine too
[12:09:11] <uGoMobi> if we go for top right I want a T-shirt too ;-)
[12:09:27] <toddparker> otherwise, no t-shirt?
[12:09:40] <toddparker> top right is most clear/simple
[12:10:15] <uGoMobi> yeah, that's why I like it
[12:10:25] <agcolom> I like top right because there's a clear hint at jQuery
[12:10:41] <agcolom> the 3 signals....
[12:10:48] <uGoMobi> yeah agcolom  that as well
[12:11:12] <toddparker> it's in the family
[12:11:18] <agcolom> yes.
[12:11:36] <agcolom> could the darkest rectangle be a bit lighter?
[12:11:40] <uGoMobi> and it would also work if you have to use a monotone logo sometime
[12:13:36] <uGoMobi> monochrome that is (mixing up Dutch)
[12:14:53] <toddparker> yeah, that logo will be easiest to work with
[12:15:11] <toddparker> do you feel like it's unique enough?
[12:15:32] <agcolom> Excellent! This is so exciting!!!! (Sorry it doesn't take much for me ;-) )

[12:40:55] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4743 - what exactly do you mean by reverse?
[12:40:56] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4743 on jquery-mobile (uGoMobi; 1h, 47m ago): Popup: transition direction reverse
[12:41:10] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: reverse is used when the popup closes.
[12:42:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: For example, "pop" goes from width/height 0x0 to width/height whatever-the-popup-is-supposed-to-have, so if I reverse that, the final result will be a popup of size 0x0 ...
[12:42:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... so, I don't get it ...
[12:46:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: for page/dialog transitions we have the option data-direction reverse (reverse page transition animation)
[12:46:55] <uGoMobi> I thought I could have a left to right slide that way
[12:48:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: difference is that you are already using reverse transition for closing the popup
[12:51:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yep.
[12:52:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so maybe it is better if we don't support this for popup and we can add left to right slide as a new transition
[12:52:16] <uGoMobi> toddparker: what do you think ^^
[12:53:07] <_|Nix|_> I don't really like the slide transitions for popup. They seem kind of useless, because the popup still appears abruptly, and then slides over a bit.
[12:53:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: don't get me wrong... I was just trying to create real-world examples with toddparker and opened tickets for things we ran into
[12:53:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: slide transitions are nice if you set the tolerance to 0, and the popup to touch the edge.
[12:53:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I think we have slideout and slidedown to counter slideup and slide.
[12:53:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I just managed to do that :D
[12:54:08] <uGoMobi> with CSS
[12:54:36] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I had a slideup widget once. It looked cool.
[12:54:59] <toddparker> closing those tickets _|Nix|_
[12:55:06] <toddparker> nice
[12:55:06] <uGoMobi> we have slide, slideup, slidedown
[12:55:25] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/apaboj/8
[12:55:26] <toddparker> slideup widget?
[12:55:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: The problem with slideup is that it increases the size of the document if you have a page that's shorter than the window.
[12:56:59] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: at the end it was pretty simple... I just set left: 0 !important; to override the offset
[12:57:09] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: A calendar picker ...
[12:57:09] <uGoMobi> that example doesn't break on resize
[12:57:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: It was sliding in off the bottom.
[12:57:10] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Gave us a ton of trouble with the document height.
[12:57:19] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Had to set overflow: hidden on the document for the duration of the transition, to avoid a vertical scrollbar ...
[12:57:35] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: We've dropped it since then, I think ...
[12:59:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Wow! That popup is nearly a page!
[13:00:26] <uGoMobi> yeah, I know _|Nix|_  :)
[13:00:46] <uGoMobi> we were just trying out things you can do with popup
[13:03:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I guess if the height of the popup is 100%, then centering upon resize is not so important, since it will /always/ be visible.
[13:04:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes indeed
[13:04:26] <uGoMobi> I see I left an superfluous function in that example
[13:04:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I'm glad there's a solution for this that does not require any new code ...
[13:04:50] <uGoMobi> this is better http://jsbin.com/apaboj/9
[13:05:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, we should always first try to make things possible with what's already there
[13:06:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Amen!
[13:07:03] <uGoMobi> :D
[13:07:39] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so I am glad you look at those things very critical!
[13:10:34] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://www.linuxtoday.com/developer/2010102400135OSSV - unfortunately, it looks like the original blog post is no longer available :(

[13:15:34] <toddparker> uGoMobi: are you porting those demos into pages in the docs?
[13:15:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4739 - if I add ui-body-x to the popup div instead of the container, the rounded corners don't work. Try it in chrome with dev tools.
[13:15:54] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4739 on jquery-mobile (uGoMobi; 3h, 31m ago): Popup: add ui-body class to popup instead of container
[13:16:41] <uGoMobi> toddparker: not yet
[13:17:06] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm... that sucks
[13:17:08] <toddparker> ok
[13:17:22] <toddparker> uGoMobi: what is the bin with the best bottom slide up
[13:18:05] <uGoMobi> toddparker: it's not there yet... just managed right to left, bottom up still not working
[13:18:14] <uGoMobi> not working means it breaks on resize
[13:18:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I will look into that
[13:19:04] <uGoMobi> might be a CSS thing
[13:21:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: http://jsbin.com/orucec/27
[13:21:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Not so good-looking.
[13:21:40] <toddparker> ok uGoMobi
[13:21:42] <toddparker> no problem
[13:21:52] <uGoMobi> toddparker: this is best right to left slide example http://jsbin.com/apaboj/9
[13:22:22] <toddparker> uGoMobi: yeah, looks hot
[13:22:43] <uGoMobi> I used CSS to make it touch the edge
[13:22:53] <uGoMobi> but I can't do the same for bottom slide up
[13:23:02] <_|Nix|_> Man, this sucks - jsbin no longer increments the slug if you make a change :(
[13:23:07] <uGoMobi> because bottom: 0 !important; breaks the slide
[13:23:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you have to click milestone to do it
[13:23:54] <uGoMobi> that's in the first menu
[13:24:15] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aaaah, cool!
[13:25:45] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: You have to move the ui-shadow and ui-corner-all over to the ui-popup as well - then it looks cool.
[13:25:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the issue with the corner styling is because the corner classes are still applied to the container
[13:26:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: exactly
[13:26:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, so I need to apply everything to the popup.
[13:26:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[13:26:25] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't get it - why is this better than applying to the container?
[13:27:16] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OTOH, we may be able to get rid of the container altogether ...
[13:27:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: the advantage is that you can do position tricks etc without interfering with the styling
[13:28:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: you can't set width 80% on div popup for example
[13:29:33] <uGoMobi> so you can set that width on the container
[13:30:59] <uGoMobi> only have take into account that the area outside the popup is where people can click to close
[13:32:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ok, sure ... I can modify the popup to do these things ...
[13:37:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: to be honest... if it would be possible to make it all work without container I think it would become easier to custom style and position popups
[13:38:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but I understand it is easy to say
[13:39:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so for now it is fine if there is a container
[13:41:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Let's take it one step at a time.
[13:41:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yes
[13:41:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We remove more and more things from the container, until it's just <div></div> ...
[13:41:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Then, we yank it.
[13:42:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: We can set up an experiment for a "naked" popup :)

[13:43:40] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] [popup] Apply theme, corners, and shadow to the payload, not the container -- Fixes: #4739 - Gabriel Schulhof
[13:44:10] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but first... do you see it as an improvement?
[13:45:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: because the popup widget as it is now is already  working great and if we try hard I am sure we can create all examples we have in mind
[13:45:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It doesn't make a difference to me ...
[13:46:37] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can do it either way. I mean, look at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/36efc37aed71ab2a449528ce3a4df61dd0b9eae3 - fairly straight-forward.
[13:46:38] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by Gabriel Schulhof (3m, 27s ago): [popup] Apply theme, corners, and shadow to the payload, not the container -- Fixes: #4739
[13:46:43] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok, just don't want you to get the impression I am complaining that it is not good as it is now
[13:47:29] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nono ... I mean, I haven't used popup nearly as much as I've hacked it. So, if these changes make it easier to work with and to integrate it into an app, I'm all in favour.
[13:48:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok cool
[13:48:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so now the element has all these styles, and the container only has one class left - ui-popup-container ...
[13:49:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, if we can apply ui-popup-container to the element, the container is no longer necessary.
[13:50:12] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: want to try?
[13:51:01] <uGoMobi> some examples in the docs will break, but we can fix that
[13:51:29] <uGoMobi> BTW - ui-popup-container becomes ui-popup than
[13:52:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK ... *crack knuckles*
[13:52:46] <agcolom> can I ask what might possibly be a very stupid question...
[13:53:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: biggest advantage is that you then can just set something like height 90% on the popup
[13:53:33] <uGoMobi> go ahead agcolom
[13:53:49] <agcolom> Can the popup have no background?
[13:53:57] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this feels a bit like Taco Bell approach :D
[13:54:05] <agcolom> (I guess no but just thought i'd ask anyway ;-) )
[13:54:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, data-theme="none"
[13:54:52] <agcolom> ho! so if I put a transparent image, it can be seen as floating above the page?
[13:55:04] <agcolom> and you can see through the transparent bits?
[13:55:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[13:55:11] <agcolom> Cool!
[13:55:20] <agcolom> That might be  a nice example?
[13:55:22] <uGoMobi> it is :)
[13:55:29] <agcolom> (and dead simple!)
[13:55:46] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: data-theme="none" data-shadow="false" data-corners="false" will result in a completely transparent popup.
[13:56:00] <agcolom> excellent! Let me try something ;-)
[13:56:31] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: You can make, like, a non-rectangular-looking popup that way ...
[13:56:41] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... if you want.
[13:58:20] <agcolom> yes, thanks !!!!

[14:08:29] <agcolom> I am still not having any luck with latest, so I cannot use data-position-to.... The image is not the best one either, but there is potential ;-) http://jsbin.com/ejafoc/7
[14:08:39] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Check out branch popup-without-container ...
[14:08:40] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] gabrielschulhof created popup-without-container (+1 new commit): http://git.io/3saVUg
[14:08:40] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-without-container] [popup] Remove container div - Gabriel Schulhof
[14:08:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[14:09:30] <uGoMobi> agcolom you can use the branch preview
[14:09:46] <agcolom> yes, good idea... thx
[14:09:49] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/jquery.mobile.js
[14:09:57] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/css/themes/default/jquery.mobile.css
[14:12:20] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: how can I pull that branch without merging it in master? just $ git pull origin popup-without-container ?
[14:13:35] <uGoMobi> I have the feeling I forget a parameter there
[14:13:46] <agcolom> http://jsbin.com/ejafoc/10
[14:15:36] <uGoMobi> yeah cool agcolom
[14:15:59] <agcolom> now we need a really proper example ;-)
[14:16:03] <uGoMobi> popup is really cool to play with
[14:16:18] <agcolom> yes, I really like them!
[14:18:27] <toddparker> you all are busy today
[14:18:30] <toddparker> just caught up
[14:18:51] <toddparker> i like the idea of simplifying if we can on the markup
[14:19:09] <toddparker> agcolom: that example could be cool
[14:19:32] <toddparker> the whole point of us dogfooding the popup and trying to really use it means it will be stronger when we release
[14:19:47] <toddparker> these changes from the last week or so would have been a pain post-alpha
[14:19:57] <toddparker> that's why i'd rather make bigger moves now
[14:20:09] <uGoMobi> I don't think all platforms support diagonal gradients, right?
[14:21:58] <uGoMobi> I created a gradient once that creates a glass effect, can be nice to use as overlay theme. then add icons in a transparent 3 x 3 grid
[14:22:14] <uGoMobi> or something like that
[14:22:38] <toddparker> cool idea uGoMobi
[14:22:57] <toddparker> diagonal as in repeating gradients at an angle?
[14:23:06] <toddparker> think that's pretty well supported
[14:23:20] <uGoMobi> no, just from upper left to bottom right
[14:23:20] <toddparker> multi-stop gradients for glass are a bit less
[14:23:23] <tbenzige> toddparker: whoops. i missed you earlier. you still around?
[14:23:24] <toddparker> but it falls back ok
[14:23:36] <toddparker> hi tbenzige
[14:23:39] <uGoMobi> I see
[14:24:01] <toddparker> i like that demo idea
[14:24:10] <tbenzige> hey there. i sent you an email last night. then i realized it was my personal email. not sure if i got blocked on your end
[14:25:35] <agcolom> so now, what has got a good transparent image?
[14:25:41] <agcolom> who ^
[14:25:44] <agcolom> not what!!!
[14:28:54] <agcolom> sorry, this is all I have! http://jsbin.com/ejafoc/13
[14:29:01] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: looks like that last push might have broken a few of the tests
[14:39:42] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Weird - ran fine on Chrome ...
[14:40:28] <uGoMobi> toddparker: how about this one http://jsbin.com/apaboj/12
[14:41:03] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Oh, crap - I must've run them on the wrong branch!
[14:44:14] <agcolom> uGoMobi: oh that is so so nice!!!
[14:44:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: it's just CSS box-shadow
[14:45:33] <uGoMobi> but it looks cool right :)
[14:47:50] <agcolom> oh yes!

[14:48:40] <toddparker> hi all - i'm back
[14:48:44] <toddparker> my mac freaked
[14:48:50] <uGoMobi> welcome back
[14:49:25] <agcolom> toddparker: uGoMobi did a really cool example: http://jsbin.com/apaboj/12
[14:49:57] <tbenzige> toddparker: did a certain mountain lion try to eat your computer?
[14:50:13] <uGoMobi> is mountain lion out already?
[14:50:21] <toddparker> plain old lion
[14:50:41] <toddparker> i was in mail, dragged a text selection and it thought i never released the drag
[14:50:47] <toddparker> it is out
[14:51:02] <toddparker> that's a hot example
[14:51:35] <uGoMobi> couldn't find the gradient glass effect but found this one with box-shadow only
[14:51:56] <agcolom> yes, all I have is a green frog! http://jsbin.com/ejafoc/12 so desperate for a nice transparent image http://jsbin.com/ejafoc/12
[14:52:16] <toddparker> hahaha
[14:52:22] <toddparker> that frog is hilarious
[14:52:46] <_|Nix|_> :)
[14:52:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nice!
[14:53:09] <agcolom> it's my own design! when i teach animated images and javascript events!
[14:53:21] <toddparker> http://www.logostage.com/logos/firefox.png
[14:53:21] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks
[14:53:26] <tbenzige> toddparker: i sent you an email last night. then i realized it was my personal email. not sure if i got blocked on your end
[14:54:04] <agcolom> very nice! I'll try that one
[14:54:07] <toddparker> agcolom: it's huge but transparent
[14:54:19] <toddparker> tbenzige: i saw it, yes
[14:54:25] <toddparker> i think it's a very cool idea
[14:54:36] <toddparker> did you start sketching something out?
[14:54:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: try CSS transform to make the fox spin :)
[14:55:19] <toddparker> http://www.naas.org/images/firefox_icon.png
[14:55:28] <toddparker> o_O
[14:56:16] <toddparker> http://promote.opera.com/logos/Opera-icon-high-res.png
[14:56:18] <tbenzige> toddparker: well not yet. at least not UI-wise. My version will probably look similar to themeroller.
[14:56:21] <_|Nix|_> o_O indeed ...
[14:56:23] <toddparker> all these are alpha trans
[14:56:40] <tbenzige> toddparker: as far as my plans for implementing, i've got a lot of sorted out in my head but haven't put anything on paper just yet
[14:57:00] <toddparker> are these displaying inline in your irc client?
[14:58:00] <toddparker> i think the tricky part is that people would need to define the UI for the too, right?
[14:58:27] <toddparker> or would there be a naming convention that you'd parse tokens from to group things
[14:58:41] <toddparker> {section-param}
[14:58:54] <tbenzige> toddparker: right, but my thought is to offer up most of the actual logic, and create a configurable UI library for the different parts
[14:59:02] <toddparker> cool
[14:59:08] <tbenzige> toddparker: sorry i misunderstood
[14:59:09] <toddparker> would this be a person project or adobe?
[14:59:29] <tbenzige> as far as parsing goes, all they'd have to do is add in some simplified comments
[14:59:31] <tbenzige> or use LESS
[15:01:45] <agcolom> goodnight everyone ;-)
[15:02:11] <tbenzige> toddparker: ^
[15:02:33] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[15:02:37] <toddparker> sorry tbenzige
[15:02:45] <toddparker> missed the last 3 minutes
[15:02:48] <toddparker> my irc died
[15:04:16] <i-hate-dave> Yippie, build fixed!
[15:04:17] <i-hate-dave> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #451: FIXED in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/451/
[15:04:26] <tbenzige> toddparker: no prob. i was just saying the parsing will require them to add some esoteric CSS comment to mark each rule.
[15:04:28] <tbenzige> or use LESS
[15:04:50] <tbenzige> toddparker: it's a personal project btw
[15:05:46] <tbenzige> toddparker: with ThemeRoller, I had a CSS token for every single editable value. This time around, I'll separate out rules as a whole.
[15:06:08] <tbenzige> e.g. text-shadow will require one token, but the app will be smart enough to separate out that specific rule into the 4 different parts
[15:06:13] <tbenzige> 3 numbers and 1 color
[15:08:11] <tbenzige> toddparker: brb
[15:08:54] <tbenzige1> back
[15:17:38] <toddparker> tbenzige: that makes sense
[15:17:55] <toddparker> the css property can drive what UI widget to show
[15:18:06] <toddparker> but the grouping/order requires something
[15:18:34] <toddparker> right - you'll have UI for specific types of css properies
[15:18:52] <tbenzige> toddparker: yeah that's true, maybe instead of relying so heavily on CSS comments, I can have developers write some JSON to specify groupings and which rules are editable
[15:19:09] <toddparker> the comments could be overloaded if needed
[15:19:23] <toddparker> but will this assume a lot of re-use like our css framework
[15:19:37] <toddparker> or would you use this live edit any css
[15:19:43] <tbenzige> toddparker: well that's what I'm targeting it towards
[15:19:48] <tbenzige> no not necessarily any CSS file
[15:19:59] <toddparker> guess the preview is another interesting thing to figure out
[15:20:04] <tbenzige> something that inheritly has structure/extensibility
[15:20:05] <toddparker> gotcha
[15:20:08] <toddparker> cool
[15:20:10] <tbenzige> like bootstrap or skeleton
[15:20:12] <tbenzige> or jquery UI
[15:20:14] <toddparker> i'd use it on client projects
[15:20:28] <tbenzige> yeah. build some basic CSS and let them customize
[15:20:31] <tbenzige> ?
[15:21:00] <tbenzige> as far as the preview goes, it's best to let the developer write their own
[15:21:13] <tbenzige> i'm going to namespace all of my classes so i can avoid iframe stuff
[15:21:17] <tbenzige> or at least, i;m going to try
[15:25:27] <toddparker> good idea
[15:25:44] <toddparker> or we do it in a light way
[15:25:58] <toddparker> iframe in a url they specify, inject a css
[15:26:39] <toddparker> _|Nix|_ and uGoMobi - looks like most (all) the stuff we needed to tweak was landed today. What's outstanding?
[15:27:50] <uGoMobi> toddparker: _|Nix|_ created a branch in which he removed the ui-popup-container
[15:28:14] <uGoMobi> toddparker: I think we have to test that
[15:29:47] <uGoMobi> I want to pull that branch but I am not sure what is the right command (don't want to merge it my local master branch)
[15:30:27] <tbenzige> toddparker: yeah cool. I'm going to add some of these details to my blog post. Thanks for the feedback
[15:30:37] <toddparker> thanks tbenzige - looking forward to it
[15:30:58] <toddparker> uGoMobi: so he totally got rid of it? interesting
[15:31:08] <uGoMobi> yes
[15:31:17] <toddparker> i wonder if it makes sense to have that just for positioning
[15:31:29] <toddparker> but move all the visual stuff onto popup
[15:31:32] <uGoMobi> I think it makes it easier to style and position the popup
[15:31:58] <toddparker> yeah. just wondering if any box model stuff would throw off positioning?
[15:32:11] <toddparker> maybe not
[15:32:30] <uGoMobi> not as long as it is included in the width/height
[15:32:45] <uGoMobi> margin does throw off the positioning
[15:33:38] <uGoMobi> but if you don't have the absolute positioned container it's easier to size a popup
[15:33:46] <toddparker> true
[15:34:01] <toddparker> i just checked out that branch and it looks pretty good
[15:34:17] <toddparker> there doesn't seem to be a theme on the popup anymore
[15:34:19] <uGoMobi> how do you check it out?
[15:34:24] <toddparker> they are transparent
[15:34:47] <toddparker> it's in the jqm repo
[15:34:59] <toddparker> git checkout popup-without-container
[15:35:21] <uGoMobi> local?
[15:35:30] <toddparker> then looked at localhost
[15:35:32] <toddparker> yep
[15:35:45] <toddparker> hanging the close buttons off looks chopped
[15:36:00] <uGoMobi> but how do I get that branch local?
[15:36:18] <toddparker> when you check it out, it switches to it
[15:36:24] <uGoMobi> $ git pull origin popup-without-container ?
[15:36:30] <uGoMobi> yes I understand
[15:36:33] <toddparker> just browse to the popup page then
[15:36:58] <uGoMobi> but I was afraid that when I pull it like that I would merge it in my local master
[15:37:12] <toddparker> it shouldn't
[15:37:56] <toddparker> git checkout <name_of_branch>
[15:38:31] <uGoMobi> yes thats what I normally do when switching to 1.1-stable
[15:38:34] <toddparker> anyone with more git fu can hop in here
[15:38:40] <toddparker> yeah, same deal
[15:38:59] <toddparker> then you can just switch back to master
[15:39:11] <uGoMobi> but I can't get the branch local
[15:39:47] <toddparker> so if you then view that site thru localhost, it should be the branch
[15:39:54] <toddparker> are you getting an error?
[15:40:01] <uGoMobi> no
[15:40:06] <uGoMobi> not an erro
[15:40:09] <uGoMobi> error*
[15:40:19] <uGoMobi> but the branch is not there
[15:40:25] <toddparker> but you're not seeing the change
[15:40:38] <toddparker> it all happens invisibly
[15:40:54] <toddparker> your copy in the local dir is now that branch
[15:41:09] <uGoMobi> what I was afraid off happened... it tries to merge that branch in my master
[15:41:25] <toddparker> do you have uncommitted changes?
[15:41:33] <uGoMobi> nope
[15:42:23] <uGoMobi> I think I need to add a parameter when I pull
[15:42:33] <toddparker> i don't like giving git advice.
[15:42:36] <uGoMobi> johnbender gseguin _|Nix|_  : any of you around?
[15:42:41] <toddparker> see it here
[15:42:42] <toddparker> http://jquerymobile.com/branches/popup-without-container/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[15:42:53] <uGoMobi> toddparker: haha, thanks anyway
[15:42:55] <toddparker> you'll see the things i mentioned
[15:44:03] <uGoMobi> ok let me see
[15:44:14] <uGoMobi> but first $ git merge --abort :)
[15:45:03] <uGoMobi> toddparker: yes, I see what you mean
[15:45:45] <toddparker> yeah
[15:45:50] <toddparker> might be a can of worms
[15:46:07] <toddparker> but maybe these are just from moving the classes anyway?
[15:46:16] <toddparker> the theme inheritance is broken for sure
[15:46:29] <toddparker> and the close buttons
[15:46:38] <toddparker> others seem ok at first gnace
[15:46:47] <toddparker> dialog is..odd
[15:47:04] <toddparker> think that's the page bg that i negated in docs.css
[15:47:06] <uGoMobi> .type-home .ui-content, .type-interior .ui-content {
[15:47:06] <uGoMobi> padding: 0;
[15:47:06] <uGoMobi> background: url(../images/px-ccc.gif) 50% 0 repeat-y;
[15:47:06] <uGoMobi> }
[15:47:12] <toddparker> ya
[15:47:27] <uGoMobi> custom CSS for docs is messing things up
[15:47:40] <toddparker> unfortunately
[15:48:03] <uGoMobi> but these are thing we can look into
[15:48:08] <toddparker> i had a rule to not show that
[15:48:29] <uGoMobi> as soon as I managed to get that branch local I can make a build and do some testing outside docs
[15:49:07] <toddparker> 	.ui-popup-container .ui-content {
[15:49:08] <uGoMobi> is that give to avoid the gradient?
[15:49:08] <toddparker> 		padding: 15px;
[15:49:09] <toddparker> 		background-image: none;
[15:49:10] <toddparker> 	}
[15:49:22] <uGoMobi> give = gif
[15:49:36] <toddparker> that negates the gray line we add for the left nav inside popups
[15:49:49] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[15:49:56] <toddparker> just need to change the scope
[15:50:22] <toddparker> done
[15:50:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] toddparker pushed 1 new commit to popup-without-container: http://git.io/7eJGQw
[15:50:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-without-container] Tweaked scope to remove gray line - toddparker
[15:51:26] <toddparker> padding need to be restored
[15:51:32] <toddparker> that's easy
[15:51:40] <toddparker> i need to head home
[15:51:46] <uGoMobi> ok
[15:51:53] <uGoMobi> I now got that branch local
[15:51:54] <toddparker> but if you think this is the way to go, we can fix up the css easily
[15:52:01] <uGoMobi> just created the branch first
