[12:09:43] <todd_> kinblas is #1778 closed? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1778
[13:29:37] <gseguin> What version of jQuery do we officially support?
[13:31:16] <gseguin> toddparker, kinblas, eddiemonge: ^^^
[13:31:36] <eddiemonge> officially? anything 1.4.2 or higher i think
[13:32:00] <gseguin> hmm, damn!
[13:32:20] <gseguin> thank you
[13:32:20] <eddiemonge> why?
[13:32:33] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1825
[13:33:03] <gseguin> it's because some of our code relies on a feature that was introduced in 1.6
[13:33:50] <eddiemonge> really? which?
[13:34:12] * gseguin is generating the github link
[13:35:04] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.collapsible.js#L75
[13:35:18] <gseguin> according to http://api.jquery.com/is/
[13:35:40] <gseguin> is( jQuery object ) was introduced in 1.6
[13:40:34] <toddparker> I think that for a 1.0 release we probably can start with 1.6.1 as a baseline. thoughts?
[13:40:51] <gseguin> the fix is pretty easy
[13:41:13] <toddparker> After that, we probably need to support the latest and one version back
[13:41:40] <eddiemonge> major version or patch fix version?
[13:41:44] <toddparker> Is there a tool that would let us find all these situations?
[13:42:17] <toddparker> I'd like to follow UI's pattern here
[13:42:21] <toddparker> I can ask them what they do
[13:42:24] <gseguin> toddparker: grep ;)
[13:42:38] <toddparker> grep away gseguin
[13:43:03] <gseguin> I made sure that this one occured only once
[13:43:26] <toddparker> look, if we can make a small tweak or two and make this work with 1.5.x or even 1.4.x let's do it. but we shouldn't go overboard
[13:43:43] <toddparker> i think some of the ajax stuff changed in 1.6 so there are diffs there too
[13:43:48] <toddparker> and the attr stuff?
[13:44:24] <gseguin> I think what you suggested makes sense
[13:45:03] <gseguin> anyway, beta adopters are not the kind of people that refuse upgrading, are they?
[13:58:18] <eddiemonge> so i guess the minimum version is 1.6
[14:16:40] <eddiemonge> so in 1.5 a dom element is getting passed instead of a string selector
[14:16:52] <eddiemonge> in 1.4 camelCase breaks it
[14:16:59] <eddiemonge> in 1.6 all is good
[14:17:42] <gseguin> so in that case should I even spend time on that issue?
[14:18:05] <gseguin> I mean, more time
[14:18:40] <toddparker> nah.
[14:19:05] <toddparker> 1.6 will be a few months old by the time we hit 1.0 in august
[14:19:27] <eddiemonge> well if we can figure out why an object and not a string is being passed we could support 1.5
[14:19:28] <toddparker> can you just comment on the issue?
[14:19:44] <gseguin> I did
[14:20:28] <gseguin> you can either close it or we'll leave it open and create a tag "jQuery version" or something like that
[14:21:15] <gseguin> eddiemonge: for this one it is as simple as testing equality between 2 jQuery objects
[14:21:43] <gseguin> but it's not guaranteed that we don't rely on 1.6 specific feature anywhere else
[14:22:37] <gseguin> I grepped for .is() calls but it's not the only function that has 1.6 specific behavior
[14:22:44] <eddiemonge> where is the $.find getting called that passes in the obj?
[14:23:34] <eddiemonge> although we should look at a way to stop doing the monkey patching on $.find
[14:23:37] * gseguin is finding the line on github
[14:24:23] <gseguin> eddiemonge: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L147
[14:24:43] <eddiemonge> not that line, i mean the line calling $.find that gets passed in to there
[14:25:11] <gseguin> oh
[14:25:23] <gseguin> let me find it
[14:25:45] <eddiemonge> i miss textmates find in folder
[14:25:51] <eddiemonge> need to figure out how to do that in vim
[14:32:24] <eddiemonge> ok so if you take out https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.collapsible.js#L109 it goes away
[14:33:22] <gseguin> eddiemonge: you can also replace the .is() call by a test for equality on the jQuery objects
[14:36:11] <gseguin> eddiemonge: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.core.js#L160 that's the one that calls $.find
[14:37:05] <eddiemonge> shadow: !!!collapsibleParent.length,  ? can someone explain the !!! to me?
[14:37:24] <toddparker> btw - i just asked john resign what he thinks about versions to support. i'll let you know what i hear
[14:37:30] <toddparker> resig
[14:37:34] <toddparker> ha!
[14:37:38] <gseguin> :)
[14:37:41] <gseguin> ok
[14:41:26] <gseguin> eddiemonge: no explanation here
[14:41:54] <gseguin> maybe make sure that the reader doesn't miss the !
[15:00:38] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.collapsible.js#L75 seems pointless
[15:01:06] <eddiemonge> to me, it looks like its saying, if the closest ancestor with this selector is me then do this
[15:09:45] <eddiemonge> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1387 needs to be reopened
[15:13:06] <gseguin> eddiemonge: I agree, it doesn't look very useful
[15:14:18] <gseguin> can we get the jqcommit bot in here for our repo?
[15:22:36] <eddiemonge> http://jsbin.com/ifobu4/5/ should the other lists collapse when another list is shown?
[15:23:44] <gseguin> I think that's the desired behavior, isn't it?
[15:24:26] <gseguin> eddiemonge: why do you want to re-open 1387?
[15:24:58] <gseguin> no that https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.collapsible.js#L75 makes more sense
[15:25:01] <eddiemonge> never mind. i was using an older version
[15:26:18] <gseguin> kinblas: are you looking into https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1640?
[16:44:40] <kinblas> gseguin: 1640 should be fixed already
[16:44:55] <gseguin> ok, it's still marked opened
[16:45:04] <gseguin> that's why I asked
[16:45:08] <kinblas> yeah I haven't done a sweep yet confirming
[16:45:09] <kinblas> :-D
[16:45:18] <kinblas> but it should be fixed (in theory)
[16:45:26] <gseguin> great!
[16:45:30] <kinblas> if you have time to confirm that would be great!
[16:45:39] <kinblas> otherwise it has to wait till after I confirm stuff on phonegap
[16:46:42] <gseguin> I'm working on #1816, maybe after that
[16:47:34] <kinblas> heh I've been noticing I'm not the only one accidentally closing issues when I add comments
[16:47:49] <kinblas> 2nd issue I've seen today alone where someone pressed the wrong button
[16:48:25] <gseguin> we need file a bug against github
