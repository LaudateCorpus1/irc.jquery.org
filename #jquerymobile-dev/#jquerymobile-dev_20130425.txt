[00:50:49] <frequent> uGoMobi: morning
[00:51:04] <uGoMobi> morning frequent 
[00:51:20] <frequent> I guess I still need to wait for my first Travis pass :-(
[00:51:37] <uGoMobi> lol
[00:51:48] <uGoMobi> yeah I saw that
[00:51:57] <uGoMobi> frequent: thanks for the PR
[00:52:16] <frequent> np. Broke my application, too, so I needed an urgent fix :-)
[00:52:32] <frequent> should I also look into the dynamic column adding, issue....
[00:53:37] <uGoMobi> frequent: I guess we also have to look at making it still work after toggling a column via the input
[00:54:28] <frequent> so to revert back to "normal" untoggled-state?
[00:55:35] <uGoMobi> frequent: I mean that if I load the test page and hide and show a column via the menu, that column won't be hidden anymore on resize
[00:56:09] <frequent> yup. 
[00:56:21] <frequent> we could set another on/off attribute, so manually hiding (ON) and showing (OFF) would remove the setAttribute and all would be back to normal CSS
[00:58:41] <uGoMobi> I would have to take a closer look at the code to say something useful about this
[00:59:21] <uGoMobi> but if that resolves it... go for it :)
[01:00:07] <uGoMobi> about the dynamic column.... maybe that's something that should wait until 1.4
[01:01:24] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok. II will add "on/off" plus check into regarding dyn columns 
[01:01:24] <uGoMobi> great if you want to work on that, but be aware that we are going to make changes to the table widget for 1.4
[01:01:44] <frequent> yes, I saw the NEXT widgets do look a little different ;-)
[01:02:43] <frequent> uGoMobi: so for 1.4 if I work with the code in NEXT, I should be ok?
[01:02:46] <uGoMobi> yeah, but what I meant was making the table modes extensions
[01:02:54] <frequent> for the time being
[01:03:12] <uGoMobi> frequent: no no
[01:03:23] <frequent> (full stop)
[01:03:36] <uGoMobi> frequent: branch "next" is only about buttonMarkup and theming
[01:04:07] <uGoMobi> frequent: actually I didn't touch table in the "next" branch
[01:04:24] <uGoMobi> well, only the markup of the column toggle button
[01:04:53] <uGoMobi> frequent: we will be working on the table widget on master or in a new branch
[01:05:10] <frequent> uGoMobi: so I just work with the code in... latest?
[01:05:18] <uGoMobi> frequent: yes
[01:05:30] <frequent> ok. perfect. thx
[01:05:49] <uGoMobi> frequent: but for the table it's a bit complicated
[01:06:17] <uGoMobi> frequent: because we added the refresh method in the 1.3-stable branch only
[01:07:06] <uGoMobi> frequent: that's why I really think we should first take care of making the modes extensions and then add a new refresh method on master
[01:07:14] <frequent> IC
[01:08:07] <frequent> So I will just update my fix for 1.3.2 (on/off) 
[01:08:22] <uGoMobi> frequent: I think that's best yeah
[01:08:36] <uGoMobi> and we can merge it in 1.3-stable
[01:08:40] <frequent> uGoMobi: ok.
[01:08:47] <uGoMobi> so you picked the right branch for the PR :)
[01:08:58] <frequent> (celebrates)
[01:09:19] <frequent> (but leaves the Travis-pass champagne in the fridge)
[01:09:25] <uGoMobi> lol
[01:09:56] <frequent> ok. talk to you later. have a  date with r.optimizer... 
[01:10:05] <uGoMobi> frequent: ok later
[01:13:09] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Ping!
[01:13:26] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: What's up?
[01:13:37] <uGoMobi> morning _|Nix|_ 
[01:13:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I was looking at checkbox disabled
[01:14:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it's broken, but I can't get it fixed for some reason
[01:14:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Lemme check ...
[01:15:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: wanted to change it so it toggles the ui-state-disabled class of the label
[01:15:33] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK.
[01:15:48] <_|Nix|_> Then you should widget: function() { return this.label; }
[01:16:18] <_|Nix|_> That will give the label to the widget factory and the widget factory's default processing will add ui-state-disabled and ui-checkboxradio-disabled to that element.
[01:17:11] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: but in _create we have $.extend( this, { label: label });
[01:17:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok I understand that solution
[01:17:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: just don't understand why this didn't work
[01:18:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I also see some differences between how we do it for selects and checkbox/radios
[01:18:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: like the select does have enable and disable methods while checkboxradio hasn't
[01:19:48] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... that's because we haven't gotten around to removing them.
[01:19:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's part of the widget review.
[01:19:56] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok
[01:20:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: shouldn't widget return the outer element (the ui-checkbox div)?
[01:21:34] <uGoMobi> Returns a jQuery object containing the original element or other relevant generated element
[01:21:39] <uGoMobi> I guess I was wrong
[01:21:50] <uGoMobi> could be the label

[02:07:06] <agcolom> Good morning! uGoMobi Are you going to Portland?
[02:07:21] <uGoMobi> agcolom: morning Anne
[02:07:24] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[02:07:32] <agcolom> Excellent! Have you booked yet?
[02:07:42] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah I did
[02:07:50] <agcolom> which airline?
[02:08:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: actually going to have little vacation there afterwards
[02:08:14] <uGoMobi> agcolom: US Airways
[02:08:34] <agcolom> ok. Do you know is united airlines is ok?
[02:08:52] <agcolom> (they're so much cheaper than all the other ones)
[02:09:05] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I don't really know
[02:09:16] <agcolom> Like half price compared to British Airways...
[02:09:26] <agcolom> When do you arrive?
[02:10:02] <uGoMobi> I believe US Airways and United Airllines are planning a merger
[02:10:09] <agcolom> ok
[02:10:14] <uGoMobi> for me US Airways was way cheaper
[02:10:30] <uGoMobi> I arrive that tuesday in the evening
[02:10:47] <uGoMobi> and staying two weeks
[02:11:02] <agcolom> nice! 
[02:11:07] <uGoMobi> yeah :)
[02:11:14] <uGoMobi> going to Seattle and Vancouver
[02:11:32] <agcolom> I'm still debating whether to arrive the sunday eve or monday eve (I'll have the board meeting on the tuesday)
[02:11:44] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[02:12:15] <agcolom> Ok, I'll check with the US people this afternoon...
[02:12:36] <uGoMobi> yeah, I am sure they can tell you about UA
[02:12:46] <uGoMobi> I believe it's one of the biggest airlines
[02:13:25] <agcolom> yes, I think so too, but weird how the prices change from one airline to the other...
[02:13:48] <uGoMobi> yeah big difference

[02:14:14] <uGoMobi> it also depends a lot on which day you fly I think
[02:15:01] <uGoMobi> my flight is cheaper than returning right after the conference because I return on the same day of the week
[02:15:23] <uGoMobi> (return flight is on tuesday as well)
[02:23:37] <agcolom> yes, with BA if I return on the sunday then it's a lot cheaper as well

[04:02:33] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: so the code that adds those classes should probably stay in .page.sections.js and not in the button widget or buttonMarkup.js

[05:30:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: _|Nix|_: either of you around?
[05:30:48] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am
[05:31:16] <arschmitz> saw you guys talking about buttons in header and button markup
[05:31:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah
[05:31:43] <arschmitz> you dont need to worry about that in the new toolbar widget it takes care of it and removes it from button markup selector
[05:31:57] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok great
[05:32:20] <arschmitz> it calls button markup it self and is isolated in its own private method
[05:32:24] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I actually made a ticket to deprecate the feature
[05:32:49] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: we have to see what $.fn.buttonMarkup will become
[05:32:53] <arschmitz> so whatever you end up doing for classes can just be added in that method
[05:33:24] <arschmitz> right i just isolated it in a private method so that method can be changed to do whatever it needs to when you finish
[05:33:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: awesome
[05:34:35] <arschmitz> but anyway only point was dont worry about any special handeling because toolbar will take care of it
[05:34:51] <frequent> uGoMobi: arschmitz: can I join the discussion?
[05:34:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: OK. I'll remove the special handling.
[05:35:01] <arschmitz> frequent of course
[05:35:02] <uGoMobi> frequent: NO!
[05:35:05] <_|Nix|_> frequent: No! It is forbidden!
[05:35:05] <arschmitz> ha ha
[05:35:06] <uGoMobi> lol
[05:35:09] <frequent> ah well...
[05:35:09] <uGoMobi> ;-)
[05:35:09] <arschmitz> BAN
[05:35:14] <_|Nix|_> :)
[05:35:18] <uGoMobi> OPERATOR
[05:35:23] <frequent> (circumvents BAN)
[05:35:35] <_|Nix|_> I'm'na go remove that special casing now.
[05:35:41] <arschmitz> nice
[05:35:53] <arschmitz> frequent whats up?
[05:35:55] <uGoMobi> frequent: still want to say something? ;)
[05:35:56] <frequent> so I was wondering why there is ui-btn-left & ui-btn-right in the header. only
[05:35:57] <_|Nix|_> ... and it's gone.
[05:36:04] <frequent> can't that be containers?
[05:36:08] <frequent> to hold more than one button
[05:36:10] <frequent> ?
[05:36:31] <uGoMobi> frequent: it also works if you set that class on a controlgroup for example
[05:36:43] <uGoMobi> so it can be a container
[05:36:48] <frequent> I'm always using a container
[05:36:58] <arschmitz> yeah header and footer just apply the classes all auto magic for you
[05:37:01] <uGoMobi> or do you mean outside the header?
[05:37:12] <frequent> because on smartphone 1 button each looks ok, but on tablet and pc
[05:37:21] <frequent> it can be quite lonely on 
[05:37:27] <frequent> ui-btn-left and ui-btn-right
[05:37:58] <uGoMobi> frequent: those class only set absolute positioning
[05:38:02] <frequent> yup
[05:38:06] <uGoMobi> s/class/classes/
[05:38:49] <frequent> I guess I'm only fussing about ui-BTN-left and ui-BTN-right, when I'm adding anything inside.
[05:39:28] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/amozef/96
[05:40:02] <frequent> uGoMobi: yup, like that
[05:40:50] <uGoMobi> frequent: there are some issues with margins on the buttons
[05:41:02] <uGoMobi> but I think I fixed that in branch "next"
[05:41:08] <frequent> tell me... 
[05:41:23] <frequent> took me a while to fix that on my app :-)
[05:41:42] <uGoMobi> in that JS bin there is an inline style on the mini controlgroup
[05:41:55] <uGoMobi> to unset the margin
[05:42:25] <frequent> hmm (taking a note)
[05:43:00] <frequent> I also like switching to iconpos=notext for all buttons in the header below xyz pixels
[05:43:20] <frequent> real-estate-management
[05:43:34] <uGoMobi> frequent: that will be really easy in 1.4 (branch "next")
[05:43:49] <frequent> cool.
[05:44:03] <uGoMobi> although I didn't test on many platforms yet
[05:45:56] <uGoMobi> frequent: then you can just add a media query with this rule for ui-btn-icon-left|right|top|bottom: text-indent: -9999px; white-space: nowrap;
[05:46:19] <uGoMobi> oh and padding: 0;
[05:47:08] <frequent> nice. You may have to add a CSS reference to "JQM" eventually ;-)
[05:48:22] <uGoMobi> CSS reference?
[05:48:49] <frequent> well you are replacing plenty of JS with CSS
[05:48:54] <frequent> teasing
[05:49:07] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[07:11:08] <toddmparker> good morning
[07:11:19] <arschmitz> Morning toddmparker:
[07:11:26] <toddmparker> just remembered, we should swap in core 2.0 into next and probably master to
[07:11:27] <toddmparker> too
[07:11:33] <toddmparker> hey arschmitz - how goes?
[07:11:37] <arschmitz> good
[07:11:42] <arschmitz> its allready in master
[07:12:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker: problem with core 2.0 is it no longer works with ie8 which we still support
[07:12:52] <arschmitz> toddmparker: any idea how ui is handling this?
[07:13:22] <toddmparker> arschmitz: true, more thinking that we should live with 2.0 for a while to see if any issues come up
[07:13:33] <toddmparker> we should support 1.9 and 2.0 for a while
[07:13:43] <arschmitz> yeah i think we need to support both for sure
[07:13:51] <arschmitz> just wondering what the best way to do that is
[07:14:48] <arschmitz> toddmparker: to me it almost seems like 1.9 would be the one in the library and 2.0 we should test against like we do git or any other version?
[07:16:20] <toddmparker> there are unit tests but i think there is a chance we'd uncover other issues if 2.0 was the library in next
[07:16:37] <toddmparker> we might want to switch back and forth as we go
[07:16:48] <arschmitz> yeah i was more talking about master
[07:16:56] <toddmparker> sure
[07:17:09] <toddmparker> we could use 2.0 in next and when we merge next into master, maybe switch back to 2.0
[07:17:23] <arschmitz> you mean back to 1.9>
[07:17:25] <arschmitz> ?
[07:17:32] <toddmparker> sorry, yeah
[07:17:40] <arschmitz> yeah i think that makes a lot of sense
[07:25:04] <arschmitz> toddmparker: have lots of toolbar goodies ready to show off today
[07:25:19] <arschmitz> trying to see if i can finish tabs up enough too 
[07:49:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: arschmitz : branch next is already on core 2.0
[07:50:05] <uGoMobi> I merged master into next a couple days ago

[09:59:44] <_|Nix|_> Cool ... I got fully reusable buttonMarkup using only string processing of classNames.
[10:00:02] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: Nice!
[10:00:35] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Basically, when you call buttonMarkup it checks what classes are present, and it calculates what buttonMarkup options/values those represent.
[10:01:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: that sounds good
[10:25:25] <agcolom> uGoMobi: sorry to bother you with this... I have booked my flight, but this time, there was no mention of ESTA. I'm not sure whether this is because I'm using a different airline. Can we reuse the old ESTA form (seem to remember it was valid for 1y)
[10:25:35] <agcolom> (or do we need to update it?
[10:25:38] <agcolom> thank you
[10:25:45] <uGoMobi> hey agcolom 
[10:26:03] <uGoMobi> you always need ESTA but I think it was even valid for 2 years
[10:26:13] <agcolom> oh really?
[10:26:23] <agcolom> that's even better!
[10:26:28] <uGoMobi> didn't check yet, but I think we are good :)
[10:27:18] <uGoMobi> agcolom: which airline did you book?
[10:27:25] <agcolom> united
[10:27:32] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:27:36] <agcolom> only £750 return!
[10:28:03] <uGoMobi> I think I paid something like 750 euro
[10:28:18] <agcolom> oh that's good!
[10:28:27] <uGoMobi> I am cheap ;)
[10:42:28] <Guest15433> Crap! babulina.go-nix.ca just gave up the ghost.
[10:43:18] <_|Nix|_> That was me saying that ...
[10:43:30] <johnbender> toddmparker: is there an agenda link floating around
[10:43:37] <johnbender> I have actual meaningful things to add today o.O
[10:43:43] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I really hope it's not the Western Digital that crashed. I'm hoping it's the power supply.
[10:43:44] <uGoMobi> oh oh
[10:44:00] <uGoMobi> WD doesn't crash
[10:44:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I hope not.
[10:45:04] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yikes
[10:45:19] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... yeah ... and I had a lot of photos of my daughter on there :(
[10:45:27] <arschmitz> was it that drive?
[10:45:35] <_|Nix|_> Yep :(
[10:45:56] <arschmitz> oh no! is it totally unrecoverable? have you checked it out yet?
[10:45:58] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hope your data is still fine 
[10:46:11] <_|Nix|_> Basically it doesn't spin up - AFAICT.
[10:46:25] <_|Nix|_> Now, this may be because the power supply gave out.
[10:46:30] <_|Nix|_> It was in an enclosure.
[10:46:39] <arschmitz> ah ok well fingers crossed
[10:47:08] <arschmitz> because if it wont spin up it *is* recoverable but you will need to do some serious work to get it
[10:47:48] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm inclined to contact professionals.
[10:47:58] <arschmitz> oh for something like that i would
[10:48:13] <arschmitz> thats way way beyond what the average person can or should do lol
[10:48:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: However, I will first buy a new enclosure to rule out the possibility that it is the power supply.
[10:48:42] <arschmitz> yeah for sure you can get an enclosure for like $10
[10:49:00] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah. I think I'll go right after the meeting.
[10:49:12] <toddmparker> hi all, just got out of my meeting
[10:49:17] <toddmparker> will make an agenda...
[10:49:21] <_|Nix|_> Fortunately there's a 24h shop that sells stuff like that.
[10:49:36] <arschmitz> nice there deffinitly is not one of those around here

[13:00:24] <toddmparker> you always know when it's a commit from uGoMobi because it says "superfluous".
[13:00:41] <uGoMobi> :)
[13:00:57] <uGoMobi> ok that was the last time I used that word
[13:01:26] <uGoMobi> redundant?
[13:02:30] <uGoMobi> superfluous is my second favorit English word after flabbergasted :)

[13:15:48] <agcolom> can people use the "new" (or future) code now and it will be fine?

[13:18:18] <scott_gonzalez> Hey, I just saw a bit of the scrollback in #jquery-meeting (saw a mention while I was gone).
[13:18:27] <scott_gonzalez> If people want to be writing 1.4 docs now, you can start.
[13:18:32] <scott_gonzalez> Just create a 1-4 branch.
[13:18:51] <scott_gonzalez> We can get the infrastructure setup later.
[13:19:11] <scott_gonzalez> We do this with UI all the time.
[13:19:13] <uGoMobi> scott_gonzalez: ok great, thanks!
[13:19:19] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ^^^
[13:19:27] <scott_gonzalez> For example: https://github.com/jquery/api.jqueryui.com/tree/1-11
[13:19:44] <scott_gonzalez> But there's no infrastucture for 1-11 right now since it hasn't been released.
[13:20:09] <johnbender> scott_gonzalez: got it
[13:20:10] <scott_gonzalez> But the 1-8 and 1-9 branches are "live" branches.
[13:21:36] <toddmparker> thanks scott_gonzalez
