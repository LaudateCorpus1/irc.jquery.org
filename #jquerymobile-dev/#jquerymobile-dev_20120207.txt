[06:58:40] <toddmparker_> morning all
[07:28:57] <Wilto> Yo yo yo.
[07:29:44] <Wilto> Just checking in briefly before disappearing to, like, actually make some websites. Anything on fire?
[08:57:52] <johnbender> YAR! irssi + proxy = win
[09:44:18] <fcheslack> so has anyone tested chrome for android yet? does it cure all of jquerymobile's android woes?
[09:51:49] <fcheslack> I'll answer my own question and say it doesn't really look like it (though it is a nicer browser)
[09:56:11] <johnbender> ....
[09:56:15] <johnbender> oh ma gad
[09:56:17] <johnbender> chrome
[09:56:19] <johnbender> for android
[09:58:36] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/abed-dance.gif
[09:58:56] <johnbender> my friend was playing the video and I was thinking to myself "nice parody"
[09:59:03] <johnbender> but it's not a parody at all]
[09:59:41] <toddmparker_> gseguin - can you test chrome beta on your ICS devices
[09:59:51] * johnbender melts with joy
[10:02:24] <toddmparker_> yeah
[10:15:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did jzaefferer have an ICS phone?
[10:16:18] <Wilto> (He’s mid-meeting.)
[10:16:21] <johnbender> this gseguin guy is killing me right now by not being online to post videos
[10:16:24] <Wilto> johnbender: I believe he did.
[10:16:28] <johnbender> Wilto: DONT CARE
[10:16:30] <johnbender> lol
[10:16:34] <Wilto> DAMMIT, GSEGUIN
[10:16:46] <Wilto> Scott’s installing on his ICS emulator, too.
[10:16:49] <Wilto> I MUST SEE IT
[10:16:53] <johnbender> seriously
[10:19:59] <Wilto> Re: “Android is now a candidate for my next phone upgrade.”
[10:20:20] <Wilto> I just said the exact same thing here. _Psyched_ about this.
[10:20:32] <johnbender> seriously
[10:20:52] <johnbender> I love android for it's openness but I couldn't stomach this browser crap
[10:21:19] <johnbender> now if I can just find a device that doesn't have a 20inch screen
[10:21:33] * johnbender dreams of nokia hardware with android
[10:37:19] <Wilto> I just feel like I’m part of the “we need an iPhone website” problem, having an iOS device.
[10:37:41] <johnbender> Wilto: you are
[10:37:45] <johnbender> :D
[10:38:07] <johnbender> luckily because android devices are so cheap these days companies really have no choice but to support the platofrm
[10:38:10] <johnbender> *form
[10:38:25] <johnbender> so at worst we have a binary system
[10:39:42] <Wilto> No need to worry, with today’s vendor prefix decision. Everything is solved forever.
[10:39:47] <Wilto> He said caustically.

[10:42:42] <Wilto> Screenshots!
[10:45:25] <Wilto> “Bandwidth management,” you say.
[10:53:56] <Wilto> If you’re not following @stephanierieger’s tweets about it, GO DO SO NOW
[10:54:03] <Wilto> Because my mind is 100% blown.
[10:56:02] <johnbender> Wilto: yah I'm watching your retweets
[10:56:18] <Wilto> This… this is genuine iOS Safari competition.
[10:56:52] <Wilto> http://i.imgur.com/IO5OY.png
[10:58:21] <johnbender> Wilto: just tweeted dave johnson about the webview
[10:58:27] <johnbender> Nitobe cto
[11:00:11] <Wilto> Read that as “Cave Johnson” initially.
[11:00:20] <Wilto> And I was just ten kinds of psyched.
[11:00:55] <Wilto> Shout-out to anyone who played Portal 2.
[11:10:31] <jzaefferer> I've got a ICS phone, yeah
[11:10:36] <jzaefferer> installing Chrome Beta :-)
[11:10:54] <johnbender> jzaefferer: super excited to hear how things look
[11:11:11] <jzaefferer> a serious Android browser decoupled from the OS (kind of), that's new
[11:11:12] <johnbender> if all the positive buzz is any indication we'll be in good shape
[11:11:25] <Wilto> jzaefferer: ON MY WAY OVER
[11:11:33] <johnbender> jzaefferer: "serious Android browser" where serious means isn't terrible
[11:11:54] <jzaefferer> johnbender: aimaing a bit higher then that
[11:12:14] <johnbender> jzaefferer: almost anything would be better at this point
[11:12:18] * johnbender is so excited
[11:12:25] <Wilto> Based on what I’m reading, this thing… is a wee tiny Chrome.
[11:12:35] <Wilto> I’ll get a goddamned Chrome tattoo, if that’s the case.
[11:12:55] <johnbender> I share the same sentiment but I will not be getting that tatoo :D
[11:13:01] <Wilto> (I will not either.)
[11:13:16] <jzaefferer> checking /test now
[11:13:43] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/wait.gif
[11:14:06] <jzaefferer> it actually transitions just fine
[11:14:17] <jzaefferer> not perfect, but also no giant crazy lag inbetween
[11:14:18] <Wilto> YEEES
[11:14:24] * johnbender falls out of his chair
[11:14:30] <Wilto> Hell, even Chrome isn’t perfect.
[11:14:34] <Wilto> Desktop Chrome.
[11:15:01] <jzaefferer> checking mobile soundcloud now :-)
[11:15:16] <jzaefferer> looks like html5 history works
[11:15:30] <jzaefferer> gotta go
[11:16:06] <Wilto> Hell of a day, today.
[11:16:28] <Wilto> psst toddmparker_ over here
[11:16:41] <toddmparker_> yessss
[11:17:59] <johnbender> sweet jesus
[11:18:03] <johnbender> they couldn't have picked a better time
[11:18:04] <johnbender> well
[11:18:06] <johnbender> actually
[11:18:12] <johnbender> shipping 4.0 with chrome would have been better
[11:18:15] <johnbender> but I'll take it
[11:25:01] <johnbender> looks like chrome for webview is in the works too
[11:45:13] <johnbender> Wilto: toddmparker_ do you guys have the numbers for minified size?
[11:45:20] <johnbender> the min+gzip is on the site
[11:46:03] <toddmparker_> I think it was around 68k total for jQ, jQM, CSS + 1 sprite
[11:46:33] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that's minified and gzipped?
[11:47:06] <toddmparker_> think so
[11:47:25] <toddmparker_> gseguin and I looked at the #'s a few weeks ago
[11:47:41] <toddmparker_> +/- 2kb :)
[11:47:46] <toddmparker_> what for?
[11:48:26] <johnbender> toddmparker_: my presentation
[11:48:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: internal for the devrel folks at adobe
[11:48:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'd be happy to send it over to you if you're interested
[11:49:04] <johnbender> hopefully I'll be done today
[11:50:12] <toddmparker_> love to see it
[11:50:30] <toddmparker_> i have a preso to do tomorrow...maybe i'll crib some goodies form yours
[11:50:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's all html and bad css
[11:51:04] <Wilto> ?mlm
[11:51:05] <bot-t1> much like myself
[11:51:12] <johnbender> since I can't imagine a single soul looking at the css I get super lazy
[11:53:39] <toddmparker_> bad bender, bad
[11:55:37] <johnbender> everybody gets lazy
[11:55:49] <johnbender> I just try to choose those times as carefully as possible
[11:56:09] <johnbender> Though if you asked my wife she might tell you differently!
[11:56:12] <johnbender> ZING
[11:57:41] <toddmparker_> hey now!
[11:58:31] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto do you guys happen to have links to those videos that gseguin made of the transitions in ics?
[11:58:38] <johnbender> I need an example of how bad it is
[11:59:35] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[11:59:42] <toddmparker_> can't seem to find the url
[11:59:49] <toddmparker_> is gseguin out?
[11:59:57] <Wilto> Yeah, no idea, here.
[12:08:56] <johnbender> kinblas: do you have any kind of random stats for large page load times from the work you were doing on the listview?
[12:09:20] <johnbender> or old emails with said stats
[12:09:23] <kinblas> stats like what? where we're spending most of our time?
[12:09:35] <johnbender> I want to through something random into my preso for the offsite
[12:09:40] <johnbender> kinblas: just load to finish
[12:09:43] <johnbender> things like that
[12:09:45] <johnbender> hmm
[12:09:51] <johnbender> I guess I could steal that from the stats page
[12:09:59] <johnbender> which doesn't work anymore because we changed test :(
[12:10:02] <johnbender> have to work on that
[12:12:17] <johnbender> kinblas: nevermind :D
[12:12:46] <kinblas> johnbender: sorry was trying to see if I had any old logs around for the profiler
[12:12:59] <kinblas> there is also a test page I checked in that timed various portions of page-loading
[12:13:08] <kinblas> I believe it's in the tools directory
[12:13:14] <johnbender> kinblas: got the stats off from the db on jquerymobile.com
[12:26:03] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: kinblas: I moved the perf work over to the jquerymobile.com repo since it doesn't play nice with our new /test setup
[12:26:15] <johnbender> makes more sense there anyway since we're keeping stats in a db
[12:27:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/BWnTWw
[12:27:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] moved perf pages over to jquerymobile.com repo - John Bender
[13:12:10] * kinblas laughs at Paul trying to click on things in the video
[13:12:16] <kinblas> why are things flipped?
[13:13:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it still drops frames though ... but no flashing which is good
[13:21:37] <johnbender>  kinblas video?
[13:21:45] * johnbender wants a video
[13:22:39] <Wilto> DO NOT DISTRIBUTE.
[13:23:16] <johnbender> Wilto: awesome
[13:26:53] <kinblas> Wilto: the fixed headers look good in the video, except for the one part where Paul was surprised that it scrolled off screen.
[13:27:04] <Wilto> Hah, yeah. Accidental tap.
[13:27:14] <kinblas> made me chuckle
[13:27:32] <johnbender> Wilto: you guys and your damn zip files
[13:27:34] <Wilto> That little 1px jitter at the bottom is easily fixable—we should probably do that anyway, really. Not the first time I’ve seen it.
[13:27:59] <Wilto> johnbender: You one of those tarballers, bruh?
[13:28:05] <kinblas> lol
[13:28:10] <johnbender> https://gist.github.com/929d2a270f229f1c1a5c
[13:28:17] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[13:28:25] <Wilto> wat
[13:28:53] <johnbender> yah
[13:28:57] <johnbender> os x and it's hidden dirs
[13:28:59] <johnbender> ughtastic
[13:29:31] <Wilto> The invisibile stuff is how you know the files contained therein are awesome.
[13:30:48] <Wilto> The zip is the delicious chocolate coating, while the invisibles are the fluffy nougat that surrounds the caramel that is the files I’m really hungry you guys.
[13:31:34] <johnbender> Wilto: either way it looks like there might be a few things to sort out but otherwise good news
[13:32:38] <Wilto> No doubt, man.
[13:38:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: can I ask you guys something
[13:38:20] <johnbender> it might be something of a conversation
[13:38:40] <toddmparker_> sure
[13:39:05] <toddmparker_> looks promising for sure
[13:39:09] <toddmparker_> paul was cracking me up
[13:39:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so I have another talk in my head
[13:40:04] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[13:40:05] <johnbender> "Devops for Front end devs"
[13:40:13] <johnbender> or something similar
[13:40:22] <johnbender> testing, ci, and more importanntly builds
[13:40:23] <toddmparker_> that would be useful to me for sure
[13:40:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so my question is
[13:40:47] <johnbender> for responsive design, do you guys load different js assets based on the media?
[13:41:19] <johnbender> for example you might load different widgets for desktop and mobile
[13:41:24] <johnbender> ala jqm/jquery ui
[13:42:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #444: SUCCESS in 27 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/444/
[13:43:02] <johnbender> timely
[13:44:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that makes dependencies and build infrastructure much more important
[13:48:18] <toddmparker_> yes, we do
[13:48:27] <toddmparker_> @wilto can chime in with details
[13:48:47] <toddmparker_> but we load assets based on capabilities (touch events, local storage, etc.) and screen size
[13:48:49] <Wilto> Hi. And hell yes we do, johnbender.
[13:48:51] <toddmparker_> both css and js
[13:50:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: is that a part of Respond.js
[13:50:25] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[13:50:44] <johnbender> ie, maybe respecting a data-media attribute on script tags?
[13:51:26] <johnbender> either way
[13:51:30] <Wilto> Nah, Respond.js doesn’t do anything in the way of that.
[13:51:31] <johnbender> the build process becomes much more important
[13:51:36] <Wilto> Hang on a sec…
[13:51:50] <Wilto> Oh yeah, big time. That’s why we ended up with the PHP solution on the Globe.
[13:51:54] <johnbender> Wilto: how did you guys handle loading different js attributes for a given device
[13:52:55] <Wilto> johnbender: http://bostonglobe.com/js/globe-controller.js
[13:53:32] <Wilto> Yepnope is my jam, for this.
[13:53:48] <johnbender> Wilto: so individual reqs?
[13:53:48] <Wilto> We loaded assets based on page type, section, and individual features.
[13:54:05] <Wilto> Yep. No swipe on the carousels without touch event support, for example.
[13:55:04] <Wilto> But yeah, yepnope is crazy delicious for this.
[13:55:14] <johnbender> Wilto: that makes sense so it has to be seperate reqs because it's so fine grained
[13:56:01] <Wilto> Yep. I’m hard-pressed to think of a situation where we’re loading JS/CSS that may not be needed.
[13:56:01] <johnbender> Wilto: it seems reasonable to expect that most people won't want to go that fine grained no?
[13:56:15] <Wilto> Well… No, likely not. But they should.
[13:56:25] <johnbender> Wilto: phone/tablet/desktop
[13:56:29] <johnbender> or just mobile/desktop
[13:56:43] <Wilto> What do you mean?
[13:56:58] <Wilto> Oh, do we have, like… a “load x,y,z if tablet” thing in there anywhere?
[13:57:26] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm not asking if you do, I'm thinking that's a more likely scenario for people looking to adopt responsive design
[13:57:36] <Wilto> Oh, oh.
[13:57:47] <johnbender> also it cuts down on load times no?
[13:57:51] <Wilto> …I would really prefer they didn’t.
[13:58:24] <Wilto> Well, kinda. On the Globe, common combinations of files are gonna end up cached server-side sooner or later.
[13:58:24] <johnbender> Wilto: I'd be interested to know how widely the set of loaded scripts varies on average
[13:58:40] <johnbender> Wilto: right but there's still a request response for each eh?
[13:58:50] <Wilto> No, we concat them all into a single request.
[13:58:50] <johnbender> and you guys have _alot_ of files
[13:59:07] <johnbender> Wilto: looking further
[13:59:30] <Wilto> <link href="/css/html5reset.css,globe-globals.css,globe-masthead.css,globe-nav.css,globe-nav-menus.css,globe-saved.css,globe-main.css,globe-footer.css,globe-print.css" rel="stylesheet" media="only all">
[13:59:44] <johnbender> ah you concat on the server
[13:59:47] <johnbender> that's why you mentioned php
[14:00:04] <johnbender> very interesting
[14:00:25] <Wilto> Oh, yeah—we used PHP, they used some Java abomination.
[14:01:02] <Wilto> I mean “solution.” “Java solution.”
[14:01:45] <johnbender> Wilto: did you guys sit a cdn in front of that?
[14:02:23] <Wilto> I’m weirdly zen about this stuff. I’m all about keeping things ridiculously granular—serve up only what’s needed in the  most specific possible manner, and avoid trying to define ranges of devices.
[14:02:24] <Wilto> They did, yeah.
[14:02:40] <Wilto> _Still_ not minified.
[14:02:47] <johnbender> it's not minified?
[14:03:05] <johnbender> oh, that was on the globe folks?
[14:03:11] <johnbender> and they haven't gotten around to it?
[14:03:12] <Wilto> Yeeep.
[14:03:17] * johnbender shrug
[14:03:55] <Wilto> Oh, it’s done. I walked them through how to do it. Somewhere, I assume there’s a big red button labeled “why haven’t we shipped this yet,” that people are mysteriously avoiding pressing.
[14:04:12] <Wilto> I am a bitter man, johnbender.
[14:05:05] <johnbender> Wilto: how does all that affect load times?
[14:05:12] <Wilto> Minification?
[14:05:14] <johnbender> actually this was a question I had about modernizr
[14:05:23] <johnbender> Wilto: no the feature detection to determine js
[14:05:25] <Wilto> Oh, the conditional loading?
[14:05:36] <johnbender> so I assume that blocks
[14:05:47] <johnbender> but I guess it wouldn't have to
[14:05:48] <Wilto> Nope. Asynchronous loadin’.
[14:06:01] <johnbender> you could have the basic css and everything setup and then let it all do it's work when it came in
[14:06:06] <johnbender> ENHANCE
[14:06:13] <Wilto> Now you’re talking.
[14:06:34] <Wilto> I mean, the stuff in that path—that’s concatenated and pulled in on page load.
[14:06:37] <Wilto> Same with the JS.
[14:06:45] <Wilto> Otherwise, you’re in FoUC territory.
[14:06:49] <Wilto> No es bueno.
[14:06:52] <johnbender> Wilto: so have you guys made that feature detection/load generic in any way?
[14:07:10] <Wilto> Modernizr’s yepnope is the best there is, for JS.
[14:07:20] <johnbender> nice
[14:07:21] <Wilto> I bet there’s gonna be a CSS equivalent soon. In Modernizr.
[14:07:28] <Wilto> I bet they’re talking to someone about it soon.
[14:07:34] <Wilto> Someone handsome, probably.
[14:07:41] <johnbender> Wilto: and do you guys attempt to deal with dependencies there?
[14:08:07] <johnbender> almost reverse dependencies
[14:08:16] <johnbender> I have touch, and orientation so I can do this things and load this js
[14:08:23] <johnbender> well
[14:08:26] <johnbender> dependencies either way
[14:08:27] <Wilto> We didn’t. It was more of a UI kinda thing—a few core dependencies, and then a bunch of add-ons.
[14:08:36] <Wilto> We do conditionally load jQuery, however.
[14:09:14] <Wilto> But I mean… Kind of a big implied dependency, there.
[14:09:30] <Wilto> As long as you pass the “not terrible” check, you get jQuery.
[14:09:36] <johnbender> Wilto: do you make a distinction between pages which libraries should load?
[14:09:41] <Wilto> (Media queries supported, either natively or via Respond.js.)
[14:09:50] <Wilto> Some, yeah.
[14:10:03] <Wilto> There could be, say, a article page specific file. I think there is—I can’t recall.
[14:10:07] <johnbender> is that just some config for the loader then ie options?
[14:10:36] <Wilto> Line 13, bostonglobe.com/js/globe-controller.js
[14:10:49] <Wilto> globe.enhanced = (respond.mediaQueriesSupported || globe.browser.ie6 || globe.browser.ie7 || globe.browser.ie8) && !(win.blackberry && !win.WebKitPoint);
[14:11:00] <Wilto> globe.browser.bluh is based on conditionals.
[14:11:13] <Wilto> And then, y’know, BlackBerry 5.
[14:12:15] <Wilto> Womp womp.
[14:13:34] <Wilto> Oh, sorry, think I misread your question.
[14:13:41] <johnbender> Wilto: alright probably my last question
[14:14:21] <johnbender> Wilto: your dependencies are hard coded in that loader it looks like
[14:14:34] <Wilto> Yep.
[14:14:53] <johnbender> and it doesn't look like yepnope is built to deal with dep management (obviously)
[14:15:11] <johnbender> it would be cool to see something like a require js plugin that did something similar to yepnope with dep resolution
[14:15:18] <johnbender> so you could think at a higher level
[14:16:02] <johnbender> Wilto: like Modernizer.globalStorage , load myStorage.js which depends on json2 and savedStorage (stealing from the globe-controller.js)
[14:16:18] <johnbender> Wilto: or even better
[14:16:26] <johnbender> have that concat happen on the back end based on the deps
[14:16:29] <Wilto> mindblown.gif
[14:16:53] <johnbender> the problem there being that dependencies can be an ugly thing
[14:17:10] <Wilto> Woah, woah—you know I have bad experiences with trying to convey client-side things to the server in a timely manner.
[14:17:16] <Wilto> please don’t ask me to use cookies again
[14:17:17] <johnbender> maybe you could pre load the deps for each module so it's instant resolution instead of brute force
[14:18:47] <Wilto> Yeah, I mean… I could see where dependencies could get real gross in a hurry on some sites, using this kind of setup.
[14:20:32] <Wilto> Alright, turnabout is fair play: I HAVE TEST-WRITING QUESTIONS.
[14:21:48] <Wilto> For these mini widgets, there doesn’t seem like anything to test apart from “if the original element has data-mini="true", does the enhanced element get .ui-mini.”
[14:21:56] <Wilto> Is that, uh… Worth doing?
[14:23:57] <johnbender> Wilto: yes, because it there's a lot of machinary between the markup and the enhanced markup
[14:24:13] <johnbender> Wilto: it would be better to verify the shape of the enhanced markup where there's a shape change
[14:24:20] <johnbender> that is, we added 2 spands
[14:24:23] <johnbender> are there two spans
[14:24:46] <Wilto> Well, there’s no change to the markup on the mini things.
[14:24:53] <johnbender> Wilto: those are actually really nice tests to because they are fast and very deterministic
[14:25:08] <johnbender> Wilto: do you have a more specific example
[14:25:09] <Wilto> Also I am capable of writing them, which is a refreshing change for me when it comes to tests.
[14:25:12] <johnbender> it's hard to generalize otherwise
[14:25:22] * johnbender cheers for Wilto
[14:25:46] <Wilto> Oh, no, every one of these mini-widgets is literally identical in every way to the full-size one save for the addition of a “ui-mini” class.
[14:27:30] <Wilto> Really not a hell of a lot of logic; almost all CSS.
[14:28:01] <Wilto> So, in the case of buttons:
[14:28:58] <Wilto> One new test for the ui-mini class. ok( [has data-mini, gets the class] ); ok( [doesn’t have data-mini, doesn’t get the class] );
[14:29:09] <Wilto> That’s probably about as far as I can go with that.
[14:30:37] <johnbender> Wilto: and that's fine
[14:30:42] <johnbender> if the purpose of that thing is to add that class
[14:30:48] <johnbender> then test for it positive and negative
[14:34:12] <Wilto> I mean… I don’t wanna test CSS stuff, do I?
[14:34:30] <Wilto> Like, determine whether the mini version of the button is actually smaller than the larger?
[14:34:34] <Wilto> I can and all, but…
[14:37:00] <johnbender> Wilto: I wouldn't
[14:37:05] <johnbender> people don't expect that to break tests
[14:37:10] <Wilto> Whew, okay.
[14:37:45] <johnbender> Wilto: maybe some day when the rendering is better we'll be able to do image comparisons
[14:37:50] <johnbender> or something crazy like that
[14:37:54] <johnbender> to avoid css issues
[14:42:15] <johnbender> that would be useful from a browser compat perspective but this is one of those areas where there are so many people way smarter than me that I assume they've thought of that and then discarded it as retarded for good reason
[14:51:50] <johnbender> Wilto: this whole concat discussion will be irrelevant when all browsers support spdy :P
[14:52:07] <johnbender> then we can just load away
[14:52:10] <Wilto> In the WOOORLD OF TOMORROOOW
[14:52:24] <johnbender> IN THE YEAR 3000!!!
[14:53:19] <Wilto> My grandkids are gonna be pumped.
[14:53:29] <johnbender> fast loading sites will be a good thing
[15:00:38] <Wilto> This test may as well have been written in crayon, but, eh. It’s a test.
