[08:17:14] <toddmparker_> latest isn't syncing again
[08:17:25] <toddmparker_> we gotta fix this right, today
[08:17:38] <toddmparker_> makes debugging really hard/confusing
[08:18:01] <toddmparker_> this doesn't have mat's latest change, from last night:

[08:53:15] <toddmparker_> hey kinblas
[08:57:31] <kinblas> hey
[08:59:35] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm here, saw the email about android
[09:01:42] <toddmparker_> hey kinblas
[09:01:49] <toddmparker_> the select issue?
[09:01:54] <toddmparker_> mind take a look?
[09:01:54] <kinblas> yeah
[09:01:59] <kinblas> on it
[09:02:02] <toddmparker_> seems nav related
[09:02:17] <kinblas> toddmparker_: not sure how responsive bender will be today, he's at a conference next 2 days
[09:02:21] <toddmparker_> thanks. Wilto is working through some styling stuff today
[09:02:23] <toddmparker_> oh, ok
[09:02:35] <toddmparker_> you guys had me worried.
[09:02:43] <toddmparker_> offline yesterday
[09:02:45] <kinblas> toddmparker_: btw, I may be stepping out for a 2-3 hours starting around 10:45am
[09:02:48] <kinblas> PST
[09:02:57] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[09:03:07] <Wilto> Just admit it, kinblas: you guys are secretly moonlighting for Sencha.
[09:03:11] <toddmparker_> hopefully, this fix will land by then
[09:03:13] <Wilto> WE’RE ONTO YOU
[09:03:14] <kinblas> toddmparker_: not totally offline, but it was the 1st time bender was physically in the same space as jorge and I so we were meeting
[09:03:20] <toddmparker_> pencils down end of the day
[09:03:26] <toddmparker_> yeah, cool
[09:03:27] <kinblas> who's day? ;-)
[09:03:33] <toddmparker_> yours
[09:03:41] <toddmparker_> i'll work on the blog post tonight
[09:03:49] <toddmparker_> and we'll just push in the morning
[09:03:59] <toddmparker_> no last minute scrambles (i hope)
[09:05:32] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ok
[09:06:24] <Wilto> Guys. Let’s be real, here: do we REALLY need any CSS?
[09:06:30] <Wilto> Let’s just take it out.
[09:08:23] <kinblas> lol
[09:08:42] <kinblas> Wilto: the answer to that is no we don't ... that's the point of the framework .. duh
[09:11:55] <toddmparker_> is's JAVASCRIPT framework. CSS is for sissies
[09:15:16] <kinblas> Wilto: I meant to ask you ... did you draw your gravatar?
[09:15:39] <kinblas> I noticed the version on g+ is larger with more detail :-)
[09:16:21] <Wilto> Man, I wish—it was done by Sue Lockwood.
[09:16:46] <Wilto> She took some liberties by making me look more like a film noir antihero, and I am 100% okay with that.
[09:16:54] <kinblas> lol
[09:17:32] <Wilto> ( http://dribbble.com/deathbearbrown )
[09:20:03] <gseguin> 'morning
[09:21:19] <Wilto> Hey gseguin.
[09:22:31] <gseguin> so is someone looking into the hawt issue already: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3068
[09:22:32] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3068 on jquery-mobile, reported by parakhm (7h, 39m ago): Select Menu Closing issue on Android
[09:22:32] <gseguin> ?
[09:22:52] <kinblas> Wilto: toddmparker: were there any changes recently to how text sits in listitems/links?
[09:23:31] <Wilto> No, not that made it into master. Why?
[09:23:41] <Wilto> * That I know of, anyway.
[09:25:23] <kinblas> toddmparker_: you saw this? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/scrolltop-0-what-am-i-missing#14737000002844804
[09:25:50] <kinblas> Wilto: was just curious, saw an issue fly by about long text and things acting different depending on where you click?
[09:26:05] <Wilto> Oh, a while back?
[09:26:50] <Wilto> There were some issues with clicking on/off the text in buttons, particularly in IE—it was resolved, but since /latest was lagging more bugs kept coming in.
[09:28:24] <Wilto> Anybody watching the SOPA hearing?
[09:28:50] <kinblas> gseguin: I was going to look into it but your welcome to help out :-) I can't repro on my Droid X thought that is 2.1 ... I do however see it on my personal phone
[09:28:58] <Wilto> Whoop, mis-fire.
[09:29:13] <gseguin> I'll take a stab at it
[09:29:34] <gseguin> bender is busy with QCon today anyway, right?
[09:29:50] <kinblas> Wilto:  it was a recent issue v
[09:29:52] <kinblas> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3073
[09:29:52] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3073 on jquery-mobile, reported by antonsw (17m, 25s ago): Android - listitem link misfire when listitem below contains long string of text
[09:30:11] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah at QConn
[09:30:14] <Wilto> “I have deduced that…” Love it.
[09:30:38] <Wilto> Hm, this is a new one on me.
[09:31:33] <toddmparker_> that is a crazy bug report
[09:31:39] <toddmparker_> i just responded
[09:36:15] <toddmparker_> ok, so who's looking at what?
[09:36:52] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: did you see my message about latest being out fo data again?
[09:37:16] <toddmparker_> kinblas: that scrolling post - errr...do you have suggestions?
[09:37:38] <kinblas> toddmparker_: which post?
[09:37:39] <eddiemonge> let me check
[09:37:59] <toddmparker_> you linked to it ^^
[09:38:01] <toddmparker_> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/scrolltop-0-what-am-i-missing#14737000002844804
[09:38:06] <toddmparker_> ok, eddiemonge
[09:39:47] <toddmparker_> who wants that custom select re-opening issue? kinblas?
[09:40:23] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I don't think it's reopening
[09:40:38] <toddmparker_> ?
[09:40:41] <kinblas> I'm wondering if it's a rendering/compositing thing?
[09:40:55] <kinblas> sort of like the flash of previous before the transition settles?
[09:41:05] <kinblas> perhaps I should make sure we're talking about the same thing
[09:41:06] <kinblas> :-)
[09:41:09] <gseguin> yeah it looks like it's reopening but I don't think it is
[09:42:00] <kinblas> toddmparker_: since it's critical it would be good to get more than one pair of eyes looking at it ... I can poke around ... gseguin can too
[09:42:11] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[09:42:28] <toddmparker_> it's odd
[09:42:34] <toddmparker_> i could repro on 2.2 and 2.3
[09:42:50] <kinblas> I can't repro on 2.1
[09:42:52] <toddmparker_> it would close, then animate open, then close itself
[09:43:05] <gseguin> sounds good kinblas
[09:43:06] <toddmparker_> you couldn't interact with the menu the second time to change the value
[09:43:09] <toddmparker_> so odd
[09:43:11] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah, like a page transiiton flash of previous pagr
[09:43:13] <kinblas> page
[09:43:22] <kinblas> toddmparker_: really?
[09:43:33] <toddmparker_> ya mon (to quote you)
[09:43:40] <toddmparker_> try it out
[09:43:45] <kinblas> I have a suspicion that our animation timer is firing before the animation is done
[09:43:55] <toddmparker_> yeah, feels like a timing thing
[09:44:07] <kinblas> ok I'm going to play with it
[09:44:22] <kinblas> sven_franck says he found something else related to custom selects on his device
[09:44:27] <kinblas> sven?
[09:44:29] <kinblas> :-)
[09:44:39] <sven_franck> kinblas: blinked!
[09:44:47] <kinblas> heh
[09:45:40] <eddiemonge> omg.
[09:45:41] <sven_franck> the 2nd select doesn't open on first click, when it opens it's in popup mode (not dialog) and badly misplaced. Topleft of dialog = centerscreen. Android 2.3.3
[09:46:07] <eddiemonge> there was an errant root cronjab messing up the nightly builds and causing folders to lock up
[09:46:23] <sven_franck> may be my Austrian HTC....
[09:46:29] <sven_franck> maybe not :-)
[09:48:04] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: all fixed up hopefully for good. ill keep watch on the (flood) of emails from the git post commit process for the next few days
[09:48:24] <toddmparker_> thanks eddiemonge
[09:48:29] <toddmparker_> what was the cause this time?
[09:48:36] <eddiemonge> hopefully i can tweak it to only send emails to everyone on errors when i can see what kind of errors it will run into
[09:48:39] <toddmparker_> seems like latest and test are super fragile now
[09:48:46] <eddiemonge> "there was an errant root cronjab messing up the nightly builds and causing folders to lock up
[09:49:09] <eddiemonge> somewhere along the way, either me or someone else, added a cronjab as root
[09:49:24] <eddiemonge> that would do a latest/nightly build
[09:49:26] <toddmparker_> ?
[09:49:35] <toddmparker_> who would have added that?
[09:49:42] <eddiemonge> i think it was setup as root because of the folder permissions that the files had before
[09:49:44] <toddmparker_>  can you look at the history there?
[09:49:50] <Wilto> I can’t even spell “cron.”
[09:50:17] <eddiemonge> i simplified the folder permissions so they are now all owned by apache, partly for johnbender's performance scripts
[09:50:32] <eddiemonge> i didnt even think to check roots cronjobs before
[09:51:06] <eddiemonge> so now everything runs through apache and one script that builds the latest files and nightly files

[09:51:26] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3074 on jquery-mobile, reported by frequent (1m, 28s ago): Android: custom select opens on 2nd click only/popup mode/wrong CSS
[09:51:48] <eddiemonge> the latest are built with github's post commit hook and nightlies are run on jqadmins cronjob, which is what we use to login to the server with
[09:59:04] <toddmparker_> so things are all set now eddiemonge
[09:59:08] <toddmparker_> at least we hope?
[09:59:22] <toddmparker_> did you get an email or was that not being watched?
[09:59:44] <eddiemonge> i didnt get an email. that was my fault
[09:59:55] <eddiemonge> i was testing yesterday and forgot to turn email notifications back on
[10:02:50] <toddmparker_> ah
[10:05:00] <eddiemonge> whats odd was that root was running the build script and in the script are hooks to remove the temp files it makes but when run as root, it wasnt doing it
[10:05:37] <eddiemonge> that part i dont understand but isnt/shouldnt have been a factor
[10:06:38] <toddmparker_> sven_franck: can't reproduce https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3074
[10:06:39] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3074 on jquery-mobile, reported by frequent (16m, 40s ago): Android: custom select opens on 2nd click only/popup mode/wrong CSS
[10:06:44] <toddmparker_> i'm on 2.3.6 tho
[10:06:52] <eddiemonge> but i ran the new process with the nightlies and latest and it seems to be running fine
[10:07:02] <toddmparker_> kinblas or gseguin or eddiemonge - you guys have a 2.3.x device?
[10:07:07] <eddiemonge> that rogue root process was the problem
[10:07:11] <gseguin> yup
[10:07:13] <eddiemonge> 2.3.4 good enough?
[10:07:19] <toddmparker_> perfect
[10:07:28] <toddmparker_> can you test that issue ^^
[10:07:30] <eddiemonge> 2.3.3 actually
[10:07:31] <gseguin> 3.2.7
[10:07:33] <eddiemonge> i nned to update
[10:07:34] <gseguin> 2.3.7
[10:07:44] <toddmparker_> scroll down a bit, select right before the disabled section
[10:08:07] <toddmparker_> might as well test both
[10:08:18] <gseguin> and click on the "your state" select?
[10:11:35] <eddiemonge> im not seeing the screenshot
[10:11:44] <eddiemonge> im seeing the correct behavior
[10:12:10] <gseguin> toddmparker_: what were you looking for?
[10:12:11] <eddiemonge> on an HTC evo 3d as well
[10:12:18] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: my slides are coming along nicely, will you guys have 5 mins to take a look later today?

[10:12:31] <toddmparker_> and a pic
[10:12:40] <gseguin> I was looking for the other one
[10:12:48] <gseguin> let me test that
[10:12:52] <toddmparker_> ok
[10:13:09] <toddmparker_> it's further down the page than the desc says. look at the pic
[10:13:25] <gseguin> nope the dialog opens just fine here on 2.3.7
[10:15:25] <gseguin> brb
[10:19:14] <toddmparker_> gseguin: mind commenting on the issue?
[10:19:24] <sven_franck> gseguin: it's the one at using "Using custom menus"
[10:19:28] <toddmparker_> think 3 can't repro means this is ok
[10:23:40] <toddmparker_> thanks for testing guys
[10:28:28] <gseguin> back
[10:29:40] <toddmparker_> hey-o
[10:31:21] <toddmparker_> sven
[10:31:33] <toddmparker_> sven_franck: that illustrates the issue with Android
[10:31:51] <toddmparker_> mind trying to trouble shoot this since none of us can repro?
[10:32:05] <sven_franck> I'll give it a try
[10:46:16] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: grabbed the page and put it on my server. works here...
[10:46:48] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: confirm anyone? http://www.stokkers.mobi/valuables/multiview/OLD/dummy2.html
[10:49:42] <toddmparker_> might be cached?
[10:52:01] <toddmparker_> sven_franck: your link works too
[10:52:06] <toddmparker_> http://bit.ly/vSIfIw - short version
[10:52:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I haven't checked my email today, how are we looking for 1.0?
[10:52:33] <toddmparker_> pretty good
[10:52:38] <johnbender> nice
[10:52:41] <toddmparker_> just have some odd select issue
[10:52:48] * gseguin tries
[10:52:49] <toddmparker_> you're at the conf?
[10:52:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah
[10:53:10] <toddmparker_> gseguin and kinblas - any luck on that double close select issue?
[10:53:14] <toddmparker_> cool johnbender
[10:53:25] <gseguin> toddmparker_, sven_franck can't reproduce with that new url
[10:53:26] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I'm making my slides and I want to add a note about 1.0 obviously
[10:53:37] <toddmparker_> i think I just need to write up a blog post and make sure these last few things are fixed up
[10:53:42] <gseguin> toddmparker_, kinblas: still looking into that double close
[10:53:43] <toddmparker_> tomorrow morning!
[10:53:48] <toddmparker_> kk gseguin
[10:53:52] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm debuggin ... classes at the time it is still showing are correct ... it's as if the browser has not done a reflow to figure out that it shouldn't be showing
[10:55:15] <toddmparker_> interesting
[10:55:19] <toddmparker_> in a sucky way
[10:55:27] <toddmparker_> android is gonna kill us
[10:55:43] <toddmparker_> i've spent most of my day tracking down phantom android issues
[10:55:52] <gseguin> kinblas: I get 2 pageshow when selecting or closing the dialog
[10:56:10] <toddmparker_> stepping out to grab food
[10:56:21] <kinblas> gseguin: first page show is due to the fact that we want to show by URL, the 2nd one is the actual show with the page element
[10:56:35] <gseguin> k
[10:56:36] <kinblas> changePage(url) -> loadPage -> changePage(ele)
[10:59:41] <johnbender> gseguin: yah it's known
[11:01:47] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: switched both dummy and docs to JQM1.0RC3.min.js from the docs.
[11:01:49] <sven_franck> Dummy works, docs doesn't work.
[11:01:50] <sven_franck> So... can't be JQM, must be a conflict with either jqm-docs.js, themeswitcher.js or that uncompressed jquery.js file, which I haven't pasted into dummy2.
[11:02:49] <johnbender> gseguin: and it's semi documented in the dynamic pages sample
[11:03:49] <gseguin> thanks for the pointer
[11:06:14] <gseguin> yeah ok I see it in the code
[11:17:45] <toddmparker_> sven_franck: try this page
[11:17:46] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/asucar
[11:18:20] <kinblas> toddmparker_: another data point regarding that select bug, I can't repro it on shorter pages
[11:18:50] <toddmparker_> odd
[11:18:54] <toddmparker_> you could repro?
[11:19:35] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm talking about the bug where the custom select shows *AFTER* it has transitioned off, before the parent page is shown again
[11:19:48] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[11:19:51] <toddmparker_> so odd
[11:20:24] <toddmparker_> tho longer page = more time thinking = timing issues
[11:20:30] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: JSBIN page works.
[11:20:32] <sven_franck> I also replaced all the other files in <head> with the exact files in JQM docs. All worked fine, so must be Android.
[11:24:44] <toddmparker_> really? so odd
[11:24:50] <toddmparker_> are you ok with closing?
[11:26:26] <toddmparker_> sven_franck ^
[11:26:46] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: yup
[11:27:59] <kinblas> toddmparker_: also another thing, the push-state stuff seems flaky on my 2.2 phone
[11:28:24] <kinblas> several times I've hit back ... and it says the right URL (where it should be) but the page has not changed
[11:28:33] * kinblas sighs
[11:28:46] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[11:28:52] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: closed
[11:29:29] <toddmparker_> we had that other issue where if you went to the single page template (ajax off), then back, then to multi-page (also ajax off), it would navigate to an odd place
[11:29:39] <toddmparker_> thanks sven_franck
[11:29:49] <toddmparker_> that's two phantom android bugs in one day
[11:29:51] <toddmparker_> i
[11:29:56] <toddmparker_> i'm goin' home
[11:40:38] <Wilto> ⌘Q
[11:42:45] <toddmparker_> nice

[12:04:50] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #3075 from agcolom/patch-36 - Todd Parker
[12:04:52] <kinblas> I think it's just a rendering prob.lem
[12:05:00] <kinblas> I'm taking the approach of grabbing the static markup
[12:05:07] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_ : did you guys do a bisect to see if this exists in older code?
[12:05:10] <kinblas> and manually applying the animation just to prove that
[12:05:24] <gseguin> so in my last test I got pageshow before webkitAnimationEnd
[12:05:36] <kinblas> johnbender: to me this is an old problem just showing up on big selects thrown by big pages
[12:06:10] <kinblas> gseguin: make sure your alert is thrown before the resolve
[12:06:48] <gseguin> I don't use alert
[12:07:41] <kinblas> gseguin: what are you using?
[12:07:47] <gseguin> jsconsole.com
[12:08:00] <gseguin> and console.log
[12:08:11] <kinblas> gseguin: ok, is your console.log done *AFTER* the resolve in animationEnd done?
[12:08:26] <kinblas> animationComplete I meant
[12:09:07] <gseguin> so I put a console.log right before the .trigger("show")
[12:09:16] <kinblas> right
[12:09:27] <kinblas> but what about the log on animation end?
[12:09:45] * kinblas thinks he should've forced everything async
[12:09:56] <gseguin> and I registered an extra webkitAnimationEnd handler that console.logs
[12:10:32] <gseguin> on open I get 'webkitAnimationEnd' then 'pageshow'
[12:10:44] <gseguin> on close I get 'pageshow' then 'webkitAnimationEnd'
[12:11:01] <kinblas> gseguin: it all depends on when you register your handler
[12:11:24] * gseguin creates a gist
[12:11:27] <kinblas> gseguin: do this .. go into transition.js
[12:11:33] <kinblas> look for done()
[12:11:40] <kinblas> and then put your console.log there
[12:11:45] <kinblas> *BEFORE* the resolve
[12:12:23] <gseguin> https://gist.github.com/d9734f9fcc158219ccad
[12:13:17] <gseguin> yeah that should be equivalent, shouldn't it?
[12:13:25] <gseguin> I'll try your way
[12:14:13] <kinblas> no it's not
[12:14:20] <kinblas> well
[12:15:06] <kinblas> in theory yours should fire first
[12:15:11] <kinblas> but does it? is the question
[12:15:20] <kinblas> to rule it out put your console.log in the done()
[12:15:32] <kinblas> I"ve already verified in my tree that it is happening first
[12:15:34] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: you there?
[12:15:43] <toddmparker_> yep eddiemonge
[12:16:02] <eddiemonge> can we revisit the theme before structure issue briefly?
[12:16:08] <gseguin> going for lunch
[12:16:20] <gseguin> let's talk after that
[12:17:21] <toddmparker_> you seen this: http://red-3.blogspot.com/
[12:19:00] <eddiemonge> what are the reasons for having theme before structure? seems like if the user wants to override something in structure they then have to include yet another css file
[12:19:58] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #281: STILL FAILING in 10 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/281/

[12:26:28] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 2 new commits to master: http://git.io/LBYd_A
[12:26:28] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Ensures that dialogs’ content elements _do_ inherit the overall page theme. - Mat Marquis
[12:26:28] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #3026 — Regression introduced by 01c77fa. - Mat Marquis
[12:28:21] <Wilto> Good thing Bender isn’t here to catch me breaking tests.
[12:28:29] <Wilto> —I mean uh what broken test when
[12:29:48] <eddiemonge> dont the logs get emailed to him?
[12:30:48] <Wilto> oh no
[12:31:01] <Wilto> Nah, no big—already fixed. Serves me right.
[12:31:05] <eddiemonge> and send via text? with a call follow-up?
[12:32:43] <Wilto> Skywriters.
[12:38:52] <kinblas> toddmparker_: sven_franck: gseguin: fyi, I can reproduce the problem with a static (no jquery-mobile js) file ... by simply placing the pop class on the 2 pages involved
[12:44:18] <toddmparker_> really?
[12:44:33] <toddmparker_> so this is just a nasty android bug kinblas
[12:46:28] <kinblas> seems like it
[12:46:36] <kinblas> it's nothing we really are doing
[12:46:42] <kinblas> if I just trigger the animation it flashes
[12:46:49] <kinblas> if I extend the duration of the animation
[12:46:52] <kinblas> things get better
[12:46:57] <kinblas> at around 1s
[12:49:11] <kinblas> toddmparker_: if you'd like, I can push my static file so you can see yourself?
[12:50:31] <toddmparker_> sure
[12:50:44] <toddmparker_> so the only way to fix this is to wait a bit longer?
[12:50:57] <toddmparker_> I'd love to get rig of custom selects
[12:50:59] <toddmparker_> rid
[12:56:13] <sven_franck> kinblas: toddmparker_: I tried downstripping CSS. didn't help.
[12:56:57] <toddmparker_> for that select issue sven_franck ?
[12:57:36] <sven_franck> toddmparker_: yup, long list to scrollTo, lot of gradients
[12:58:01] <toddmparker_> so odd
[12:58:18] <sven_franck> since it only seems to happen on long pages (requiring more scrolling) I thought I'd make the scrollable area more... even...
[12:58:21] <toddmparker_> makes me wonder what is custom about your build
[12:59:16] <sven_franck> :-)
[13:04:50] <kinblas> toddmparker_: http://shinarp.com/temp/issue-3068-static.html
[13:05:03] <kinblas> I modified it so you can click anywhere and it toggles the placement of the pop class
[13:05:05] <kinblas> that's all it does
[13:05:38] <toddmparker_> so i need droid 2.2 or 2.3 kinblas
[13:07:01] <sven_franck> kinblas: toddmparker_: isn't this similar to #455 jumpy and blinky page transitions?
[13:07:41] <toddmparker_> this is about customs selects opening twice
[13:07:55] <toddmparker_> http://www.markus-falk.com/mobile-frameworks-comparison-chart/
[13:08:07] <sven_franck> ok
[13:10:56] <gseguin> so what's the call on that issues, are we going to work around it?
[13:11:05] <gseguin> s/issues/issue/
[13:12:34] <toddmparker_> the large custom select double opening gseguin?
[13:12:41] <gseguin> yes
[13:12:51] <toddmparker_> well...
[13:13:07] <toddmparker_> kinblas: if we increase the wait, things work better?
[13:13:25] <toddmparker_> just trying to figure out what our options are
[13:13:34] <gseguin> which wait?
[13:13:44] <gseguin> I thought that was event based?
[13:13:48] <kinblas> toddmparker_: well, there's no flash of the "from" page if it is longer
[13:14:05] <kinblas> gseguin: you don't need any jqm to see the problem
[13:14:10] <kinblas> you just need to trigger the animation
[13:14:23] <gseguin> kinblas: yes, I saw your static page
[13:14:43] <toddmparker_> yeah, me too
[13:15:01] <toddmparker_> so i'm confused
[13:15:08] <toddmparker_> can you recap?
[13:15:34] <toddmparker_> we need to so something because this looks really bad in android
[13:15:40] <toddmparker_> just a matter of what
[13:15:46] <toddmparker_> kinblas / gseguin
[13:17:32] <gseguin> oh the wait you're talking about is the length of the animation ?
[13:17:42] * gseguin is confused too
[13:18:00] <kinblas> toddmparker_: in-short all of this blinky-ness is caused by the animations themselves
[13:18:16] <kinblas> it seems to be related to how-big the elements are that are involved in the animation
[13:18:25] <kinblas> shorter main-page improves things
[13:19:00] <kinblas> also, a longer animation-duration allows you to see the animation, and prevents the flash of the "from" page after it has disappeared
[13:19:17] <kinblas> at the default 350ms
[13:19:25] <kinblas> I rarely see the animation
[13:19:42] <kinblas> at 100ms, i see animation, but frames are being dropped (significantly)
[13:19:58] <kinblas> my phone does not have GPU acceleration so it's a rendering speed
[13:20:01] <kinblas> and memory thing I think
[13:20:02] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[13:20:03] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #282: FIXED in 10 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/282/

[13:20:04] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * mat: Fixes #3026 — Regression introduced by 01c77fa.
[13:20:36] <kinblas> thanks for bustin-my-flow jqm-jenkins-bot
[13:21:12] <toddmparker_> i see
[13:21:21] <toddmparker_> so what do you recommend kinblas
[13:23:38] <kinblas> I recommend folks turn off animation on android
[13:23:54] <kinblas> it's slow and buggy
[13:24:29] <toddmparker_> yikes
[13:24:49] <toddmparker_> like turn off all page transitions??
[13:24:51] <kinblas> it's so inconsistent across all the devices
[13:25:03] <kinblas> android devices that is
[13:25:16] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it's what folks are doing in the wild
[13:25:44] <kinblas> toddmparker_: another approach would be to break up our doc pages
[13:25:50] <kinblas> but I hate hiding problems like this
[13:25:50] <toddmparker_> that's a wee bit much for the night before 1.0 :)
[13:25:56] <kinblas> it's what everyone else does
[13:26:12] <toddmparker_> i've been meaning to break up the select menu page
[13:26:21] <kinblas> yeah it's way too long
[13:26:29] <sven_franck> kinblas: toddmparker: if I turn off transitions it works.
[13:26:31] <toddmparker_> any others?
[13:26:39] <sven_franck> see here:
[13:26:41] <sven_franck> http://www.stokkers.mobi/valuables/multiview/OLD/dummy3.html
[13:27:21] <sven_franck> "open" fires only once on my Android (well... still) , so I thought maybe the blinky transitions after all
[13:27:29] <gseguin> so UA sniffing and disable animations?
[13:28:04] <toddmparker_> guys, not an option
[13:28:14] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm not sure what else we can do, I can spend today messing around with CSS, but gseguin and I did that for a month with no luck before
[13:28:34] <toddmparker_> so this is for the double open select, right?
[13:28:40] <toddmparker_> not the blinky page bug?
[13:28:41] <sven_franck> kinblas: toddmparker: sorry. still blinking
[13:28:44] <Wilto> Yeah, no, +1 to not introducing UA sniffing for the sake of transitions.
[13:29:04] <sven_franck> toddparker: double open.
[13:29:05] <toddmparker_> what happend to "this is the release code"
[13:29:07] <toddmparker_> heh
[13:29:13] <kinblas> toddmparker_: by double open, you mean 3068?
[13:29:22] <gseguin> we could do it so people can force enable animations through an option
[13:29:39] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3068
[13:29:39] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3068 on jquery-mobile, reported by parakhm (11h, 46m ago): Select Menu Closing issue on Android
[13:29:41] <toddmparker_> yep
[13:29:51] <kinblas> yeah, it's not that *WE* are double opening
[13:30:03] <Wilto> This conversation is running the very real risk of terrifying me into a coma.
[13:30:06] <toddmparker_> admit it, you are kinblas
[13:30:14] <Wilto> I SEEN ’EM DO IT
[13:30:22] <gseguin> like by default we disable transitions on Android unless user sets $.mobile.iWantTheUglyTransitions
[13:30:42] <toddmparker_> all i want to do after tomorrow is re-think transitions
[13:30:50] <toddmparker_> i'm ok with radical there
[13:30:53] <Wilto> gseguin: That still means a huge and terrifying UA sniff.
[13:30:55] <toddmparker_> but today, no so much
[13:31:35] <gseguin> Wilto: I know I don't like them either but how do you detect that transitions will suck?
[13:31:41] <Wilto> You can’t.
[13:31:52] <toddmparker_> before we go too far off-track...
[13:32:12] <toddmparker_> kinblas: if we make the select page shorter so the issue isn't as obvious
[13:32:24] <Wilto> Honestly, I’d rather see us—post 1.0—completely raze transitions to the ground and try again before we went the Oprah style “and you get a transition, and YOU get a transition” route.
[13:32:25] <toddmparker_> and we put some warnign about custom select perf anyway
[13:32:33] <toddmparker_> does that suffice for now?
[13:32:34] <Wilto> Right; sorry. On-task.
[13:32:55] <toddmparker_> think we all want to re-do these
[13:32:55] <kinblas> it's really up to you guys
[13:33:04] <kinblas> I'm totally fine with leaving it on
[13:33:11] <kinblas> and then giving them a sample of how to turn it off selectively
[13:33:13] <toddmparker_> well, we can't make any big changes now for sure
[13:33:38] <kinblas> so my suggestion is docs only ;-)
[13:33:51] <kinblas> let's cop to the lameness of transitions
[13:33:54] <kinblas> and say if you're fed up
[13:33:56] <kinblas> do this
[13:33:57] <toddmparker_> if you want to add a blub to the transitions page about how to disable selectively, sure
[13:34:01] <Wilto> DELETE THE DOCS GOT IT
[13:34:04] <toddmparker_> heh
[13:34:09] <toddmparker_> lameness of ANDROID
[13:34:11] <kinblas> heh
[13:36:03] <toddmparker_> so on this bug, there's nothing we can do to improve it for 1.0
[13:36:14] <toddmparker_> other than education and adjusting demos
[13:38:04] <kinblas> toddmparker_: like I said, I can sit here and futz with CSS and JS all day today to see if I can find something ... the suggestion everyone makes about the backface-visibility doesn't work for me in this case, probably because the pages are to big
[13:39:01] <toddmparker_> backface is also causing other issues in android
[13:39:08] <toddmparker_> makes text inputs freak out
[13:39:22] <gseguin> toddmparker_: any other issue I should look into for 1.0?
[13:39:46] <toddmparker_> i'd really appreciate it if you guys could do some final testing today
[13:39:50] <toddmparker_> just paranoid
[13:40:21] <gseguin> ok, any particular device?
[13:42:20] <Wilto> Android and Mango have been the most troublesome, for my part. I wouldn’t mind having more eyes on ’em.
[13:42:55] <toddmparker_> yeah +1
[13:43:05] <toddmparker_> but rally just everything you got
[13:43:06] * gseguin starts testing on Mango
[13:43:13] <toddmparker_> won't want anything obviously broken
[13:43:15] <toddmparker_> thanks!
[13:43:24] <Wilto> The Mango, she hates me.
[13:44:43] <sven_franck> _toddparker: last post from me on this :-)  - no 2nd open if dialogtransition is off http://www.stokkers.mobi/valuables/multiview/OLD/dummy3.html
[13:50:14] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'll tell you what, I can spend some time trying to figure out what that size threshold is for pages
[13:58:52] <toddmparker_> that might be good to have a rough rule of thumb
[13:58:56] <toddmparker_> kinblas ^
[13:59:18] <toddmparker_> but for now, that issue can't be fixed, just mitigated with page size
[13:59:45] <toddmparker_> kinblas: could you add a comment to the issue with the tech details and suggestion to either use native or keep pages small
[14:01:35] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ok
[14:03:43] <kinblas> toddmparker_: oh yeah! the other way to get around it is to *NOT* use custom select :-)
[14:09:03] <toddmparker_> riiiight
[14:09:19] <toddmparker_> seriously, i would jettison custom selects
[14:09:36] <toddmparker_> so that's an option is suppose
[14:09:47] <toddmparker_> tho, i still think that's too big a change
[14:09:57] <Wilto> Depends on whether I’m working on them at the time. While fixing something, I think they should go. After fixing something, I’m like “these things work amazing, considering.”
[14:09:57] <toddmparker_> esp. if we can make the page more resonable
[14:11:45] <kinblas> they also work well on iOS
[14:14:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/e0t1eQ
[14:14:06] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #3041 — Cleans up the support test for Opera Mini and opts it out of fixed toolbar behavior. - Mat Marquis
[14:15:15] <toddmparker_> nice fix Wilto
[14:15:31] <Wilto> I ain’t proud of what I’ve just done, but it sure as hell works.
[14:15:36] <toddmparker_> custom selects now work well in webos and opera mini
[14:15:45] <toddmparker_> and fixed headers aren't busted in mini anymor
[14:16:23] <toddmparker_> kin - i really do want to dig into transitions tomorrow with you
[14:16:42] <toddmparker_> we need to start with the constraints, android perf being one of them
[14:16:59] <kinblas> yup
[14:17:02] <toddmparker_> and design/iterate transition ideas that play to the strengths
[14:17:07] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I just updated the bug
[14:17:25] <toddmparker_> was thinking a lot about scrolling, but android perf is prolly just as big
[14:17:31] <toddmparker_> thanks kinblas
[14:18:02] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm going to try and continue futzing with the static markup to see if I can glean any other details
[14:18:42] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[14:19:00] <toddmparker_> i need you to help me better understand the ins and outs of android so we can design smooth transitions
[14:19:28] <Wilto> Yeah, I want in on that action as well.
[14:19:35] <toddmparker_> but if you want to start a new branch and start working on experiments, feel free
[14:20:15] <toddmparker_> we can set a few base assumptions: native scrolling, same viewport for both pages
[14:20:17] <toddmparker_> etc.
[14:20:34] <toddmparker_> then look at each part fo the transition sequence for ideas
[14:21:14] <toddmparker_> strip it down to bare mechanics, figure out what works, re-build new transitions with pieces that work
[14:21:50] <toddmparker_> been itching to do this for a year. let's go,go,go
[14:23:23] <Wilto> Hey kinblas, you gonna have a chance to look into this, or should I grab it:
[14:23:24] <Wilto> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3056
[14:23:25] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3056 on jquery-mobile, reported by rbdrbd (1d, 5h ago): page-dynamic.html minor improvement for race condition
[14:23:31] <toddmparker_> kin - should we close this or leave open?
[14:23:32] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2853
[14:23:33] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2853 on jquery-mobile, reported by jblas (3w, 5h ago): Improve page enhancement performance
[14:23:47] <toddmparker_> and just remove the milestone
[14:23:49] <kinblas> Wilto: I saw it fly by the other day, but he didn't say what the race was did he?
[14:24:13] <Wilto> …Wait.
[14:24:28] <Wilto> “I fixed this by simply moving the e.preventDefault() to come before the call to showCategory() (since showCategory() makes the call to changePage())”
[14:24:32] <Wilto> wat
[14:24:47] <kinblas> Wilto: that's bogus
[14:25:08] <kinblas> preventDefault only matters to the caller
[14:25:13] <Wilto> Agreed. I’ll just respond with http://wil.to/_/huh.jpg
[14:25:20] <kinblas> so moving it before that sample function doesn't really do much
[14:25:30] <Wilto> No, I wouldn’t think so.
[14:25:39] <toddmparker_> that is just a docs thing anyway. not critical for 1.0
[14:26:08] <toddmparker_> kin, can you respond and either close or leave open as low priority, no milestone
[14:27:39] <kinblas> done
[14:32:58] <toddmparker_> thanks!
[14:33:16] <toddmparker_> and then there were none:
[14:33:16] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?milestone=10&sort=created&direction=desc&state=open
[14:33:32] <toddmparker_> Wilto is going to break up the select page into 2
[14:33:49] <toddmparker_> but i think we're good unless testing turns up a showstopper
[14:33:54] <Wilto> Wouldn’t seem right if I didn’t make a doc change just before a launch.
[14:34:00] <gseguin> heh looks like we have a 1.0 here
[14:34:47] <gseguin> nothing major on Mango, transitions suck but beside that looks pretty good so far
[14:36:27] <toddmparker_> good to hear. browser isn't anything that great
[14:36:33] <toddmparker_> oh, we got our kindle fire
[14:36:36] <toddmparker_> works like a charm
[14:37:05] <gseguin> awesome! We should be receiving ours shortly
[14:37:49] <gseguin> one thing on Mango: in /docs/buttons/buttons-types.html
[14:37:59] <gseguin> last button in the page
[14:38:32] <gseguin> it shows square corners in a very thin stroke
[14:38:57] <gseguin> but the rounded corners are there
[14:39:13] <kinblas> toddmparker_: what is this browserstack thing?
[14:39:19] <kinblas> gseguin: there are no transitions right?
[14:39:20] <gseguin> button label is imageBtn
[14:39:26] <toddmparker_> not sure
[14:39:31] <toddmparker_> you're invited tho
[14:39:37] <kinblas> heh
[14:39:46] <kinblas> you're invited to the party but I don't know who's hostin'
[14:40:09] <Wilto> Or the occasion.
[14:40:10] <gseguin> browserstack is so you don't have to install windows on a VM to test on IE
[14:40:18] <gseguin> or other browsers
[14:40:31] <gseguin> it's a pretty awesome tool
[14:40:39] <kinblas> is it like browser-lab?
[14:40:44] <toddmparker_> http://www.browserstack.com/
[14:40:51] <toddmparker_> desktop browser testing on vm's
[14:41:24] <toddmparker_> so after we launch, what do we need to do in git
[14:41:30] <toddmparker_> branch for 1.next?
[14:41:42] <toddmparker_> commit fixes for 1.0.x to master?
[14:42:01] <toddmparker_> just keep that branch updated with master?
[14:42:08] <gseguin> I would do the opposite
[14:42:20] <kinblas> branch 1.0.x
[14:42:21] <toddmparker_> have master be the next version?
[14:42:22] <Wilto> Start a “working” branch?
[14:42:32] <kinblas> keep head for 2.next
[14:42:35] <gseguin> master is your working branch
[14:42:55] <toddmparker_> so you cherry pick fixes to the maintenance branch?
[14:43:03] <kinblas> ya mon
[14:43:05] <gseguin> yep
[14:44:48] <toddmparker_> gseguin: you're right
[14:44:49] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[14:44:50] <gseguin> kinblas: on Mango there is some kind of transition because when changing page I get at some point the text of both pages displayed at the same time
[14:44:59] <toddmparker_> stable is 1.8 and there's a branch for that
[14:45:04] <toddmparker_> master is 1.9
[14:45:22] <toddmparker_> version is 1.9pre
[14:45:46] <toddmparker_> so we make a 1.0stable branch
[14:46:00] <toddmparker_> set our version to 1.1pre in master and go
[14:47:25] <kinblas> gseguin: on my Mango device pages pop into place
[14:47:27] <kinblas> no transition
[14:48:11] <kinblas> we use keyframe animation and I don't think IE supprts keyframe
[14:48:14] <kinblas> it supports transitions though
[14:48:15] <gseguin> kinblas: you don't get the text from both pages displaying at the same time?
[14:48:28] <gseguin> oh that's right, duh!
[14:49:03] <gseguin> which device do you have?
[14:51:17] <kinblas> gseguin: it's a dell something, not sure of the model
[14:51:42] <gseguin> ok so we don't have the same
[14:58:27] <toddmparker_> nope, they dont
[14:58:35] <toddmparker_> wonder if they support transitions
[14:59:43] <toddmparker_> kinblas: i'd like to make the switch to transitions when we re-factor anyway
[14:59:57] <toddmparker_> if it's not worse. didn't seem to be in testing
[15:02:08] <kinblas> transitions are harder to support
[15:02:15] <toddmparker_> yeah kinblas
[15:02:17] <toddmparker_> ?
[15:02:25] <toddmparker_> just buggier?
[15:02:40] <toddmparker_> seemed similiar when we were doing testing
[15:02:48] <kinblas> no, it's the API for listening to them that sucks
[15:03:07] <kinblas> you setup each *property* for a transition
[15:03:19] <kinblas> and you get a notification for each property when they are done for each property on each element
[15:03:38] <toddmparker_> ah, right
[15:04:15] <toddmparker_> maybe there are tools to make that a bit easier
[15:04:22] <toddmparker_> is this pull a bad idea? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/3078
[15:04:23] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by adrianpike (4m, 4s ago): Fixed #2234 - form hijacking wasn't respecting allowCrossDomainPages, now it does!
[15:04:26] <kinblas> toddmaprker_: oh yeah, and they blink just as bad
[15:04:28] <kinblas> :-P
[15:04:37] <toddmparker_> yeah they do
[15:04:58] <toddmparker_> it was a mixed bag. but in theory they are more compatible, future-looking, etc.
[15:10:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm a bit hesitant at this point to muck with navigation/submit stuff
[15:10:20] <kinblas> in general form cross-domain submits are allowed I think?
[15:10:43] <toddmparker_> i don't mean for 1.0
[15:10:54] <toddmparker_> just wondering in general
[15:12:09] <gseguin> the slider doesn't slide on Mango
[15:12:17] <gseguin> is that a known issue?
[15:12:43] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ^
[15:13:01] <Wilto> Yeah. Touch event thing.
[15:13:02] <toddmparker_> gseguin: no touch events :/
[15:13:04] <Wilto> Clicking the slider bar works.
[15:13:11] <toddmparker_> same on webos
[15:13:14] <gseguin> ok
[15:13:18] <toddmparker_> that's why the input is nice to have
[15:13:29] <Wilto> s/clicking/tapping/i
[15:13:34] <gseguin> yes Wilto clicking inside the slider bar does work
[15:15:12] <kinblas> gseguin: they don't support touch events
[15:17:38] <gseguin> boo!

[15:19:55] <jqm-jenkins-bot> mat: Fixes #3041 — Cleans up the support test for Opera Mini and opts it out of fixed toolbar behavior.
[15:21:23] <Wilto> My lawyer has advised me not to comment on whether or not touch events will be supported in Windows 8.
[15:21:31] <Wilto> _He said caustically._
[15:22:19] <sven_franck> kinblas: quick question on my history:
[15:22:28] <sven_franck> sorry wrong window...
[15:24:20] <gseguin> then I don't see anything to report on Mango by browsing /test
[15:25:03] <Wilto> Yeah, it’s pretty okay. Just be sure to beat on the select menus.
[15:25:27] <Wilto> I was seeing an issue where “disabled” was being ignored on selects—I’m wondering if that doesn’t have something to do with us using a value-less attribute for that, in the docs.
[15:26:11] <gseguin> yep disabled is ignored
[15:27:21] <gseguin> and the "transition" in and out of custom select is pretty horrible

[15:29:11] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Updated docs to split native/custom selects into two separate pages. - Mat Marquis
[15:30:43] <Wilto> If you wanted to see what happens with “disabled="disabled"” or “true” or something on there, I’m curious—not a big thing, though.
[15:31:02] <Wilto> And if disabled is wholesale broken in Mango, I don’t think that’s on us to fix.
[15:36:34] <Wilto> And on that sour note, I am headed out.

[16:20:59] <jqm-jenkins-bot> mat: Updated docs to split native/custom selects into two separate pages.
[16:26:00] <gseguin> long custom select is unusable on Mango
[17:37:45] <Wilto> How’s that, gseguin?
[17:38:08] <gseguin> it's so slow to draw the custom select for the states
[17:38:20] <gseguin> that it's not realistically usable
[17:42:26] <gseguin> at least on my phone

[17:54:30] <eddiemonge> ?
[17:55:04] <Wilto> Sorry, that was at gseguin.
[17:56:07] <Wilto> Just hoping the big selects in Mango are a matter of performance, or if they were looking busted-busted.
[17:59:19] <Wilto> That wasn’t really English, but, y’know.
