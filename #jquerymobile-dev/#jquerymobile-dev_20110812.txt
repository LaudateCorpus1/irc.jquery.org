[07:10:18] <todd_> morning all
[07:16:32] <todd_> this step feature for slider seems clean
[07:16:34] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2273
[07:16:41] <todd_> anyone want to review and pull in if ok?
[07:54:45] <todd_> any ideas on this? http://forum.jquery.com/topic/pagecreate-event-not-being-generated-in-latest-jquery-mobile-build#14737000002623042
[09:09:05] <gseguin> todd_:  I saw your comment on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2271 after I fixed it
[09:09:18] <kinblas> heh I  was just going to ping you about that
[09:09:26] <kinblas> gseguin: one more reason to have a generic filter api
[09:09:47] <kinblas> he could've supplied a filter of his own to hide whatever it is he wanted to be hidden
[09:10:05] <gseguin> yep
[09:11:30] <gseguin> kinblas: I was filtering the lis with .not( ".ui-screen-hidden" )
[09:11:44] <gseguin> instead of .filter( ":visible" )
[09:12:00] <gseguin> because at create time the page is not visible
[09:12:34] <gseguin> so I just passed on the create flag to _refreshCorners
[09:12:47] <gseguin> and now do: create?$li.not( ".ui-screen-hidden" ):$li.filter( ":visible" );
[09:14:32] <kinblas> I wasn't so much harping on how you were searching ... but on the fact that filtering a list to hide things is kind of a primitive that we should provide .. generically
[09:15:02] <kinblas> Then the listview.filter component just becomes a textfield with event handlers on it that call listview("filter", myfilterfunc)
[09:15:42] <gseguin> and automatically takes care of the corners
[09:15:52] <gseguin> yep agreed
[09:16:05] <kinblas> if we provided a primitive, then folks like issue 2271 wouldn't be hiding it manually .... and yes the corners would always be correct
[09:16:23] <gseguin> should we do that for b3 you think?
[09:16:48] <kinblas> how many folks have complained about the corners problem?
[09:16:57] * kinblas wants to say yes btw :-)
[09:17:04] <gseguin> hard to say
[09:17:16] <kinblas> toddmparker: todd_: what do you think?
[09:17:17] <gseguin> there were a few bugs
[09:17:44] <gseguin> todd_, toddmparker: which one are you today?
[09:17:48] <kinblas> lol
[09:17:56] <kinblas> I was just thinking that .. todd uses so many nicknames
[09:17:59] <kinblas> :-)
[09:18:21] <gseguin> and I always seem to pick the wrong one :)
[09:18:35] <kinblas> lol ... he should set up alert/highlighting for just todd
[09:27:38] <kinblas> gseguin: just curious, what irc client do you use?
[09:29:59] <gseguin> kinblas: I use Colloquy on my Mac
[09:30:07] <gseguin> Quassel on my Linux box
[09:30:07] * _nickel boos
[09:30:17] * _nickel boos louder
[09:30:24] <_nickel> jk
[09:30:27] <_nickel> IRSSI!
[09:30:32] <_nickel> dot file configurable
[09:31:03] <_nickel> kinblas: you can also use MacIrssi
[09:31:04] <gseguin> _nickel: never heard of it
[09:31:52] <_nickel> kinblas: there's a windows, version too so in theory you can pass your config between machines
[09:32:05] <_nickel> spurious comma is spurious
[09:32:07] * kinblas looks up irssi
[09:33:15] * gseguin downloads macirssi
[09:37:39] <gseguin> _nickel: oh my! I have to do /connect
[09:38:07] <_nickel> gseguin: only until you set up your dotfiles with the channels you want
[09:38:16] * gseguin likes the click and work of Colloquy
[09:38:22] <_nickel> :D
[09:38:29] <_nickel> its definitly for cli lovers
[09:38:40] <_nickel> kinblas: fair warning (if a little late) ^
[09:39:02] <gseguin> I like cli where it's useful
[09:39:12] <gseguin> I'll give it a try
[09:51:11] <todd_> ah, gseguin - so that rounded corner list thing is already fixed?
[09:51:19] <todd_> can you comment and close?
[09:51:26] <todd_> give you credit
[09:52:01] <todd_> landing that would be cool
[09:52:14] <todd_> err, i don't mean to have so man nicjnames
[09:52:17] <todd_> dunno why that happens
[09:52:25] <todd_> i only log in on one computer, one client
[09:52:27] <todd_> odd
[09:52:54] <gseguin> todd_: I haven't pushed yet, but yeah it's fixed locally
[09:52:59] <todd_> i'm on Colloquy too
[09:53:07] <todd_> tell me what to do to make my name less jumpy
[09:53:47] <todd_> great news gseguin
[09:53:57] <gseguin> todd_:  _nickel recommends the use of irssi
[09:53:59] <todd_> scott is out today btw
[09:54:07] <todd_> it's his birday day off. corporate policy
[09:54:13] <_nickel> nice
[09:54:14] <todd_> he took it a few days late
[09:54:27] <gseguin> oh that's nice policy
[09:54:29] <todd_> i gotta work on the blog post today too
[09:54:34] <todd_> yeah, i like it
[09:54:55] <todd_> scott said he got pushState pretty much ready to go
[09:55:03] <gseguin> woohoo!
[09:55:08] <todd_> yeah!
[09:55:08] <_nickel> todd_: easy fix for that issue
[09:55:18] <todd_> corners?
[09:55:21] <_nickel> todd_: push the fix in minutes and a test will follow
[09:55:34] <gseguin> _nickel: which issue?
[09:55:34] <_nickel> the one you emailed me about
[09:55:38] <gseguin> ohok
[09:55:43] <_nickel> select menus
[09:55:50] <todd_> Colloquy is as techy as i go. if i need to use a CLI, i'm out
[09:55:54] <todd_> oh, gotcha
[09:56:04] <todd_> cool, just figured it was on your radar
[09:58:01] <_nickel> todd_: actually I'm quite bad at watching issues
[09:58:06] <_nickel> I need to get better at it
[09:58:14] <todd_> do you get emails?
[10:00:02] <_nickel> todd_: I do, but so very many of them
[10:00:19] <_nickel> I haven't been able to tailor the settings well at all
[10:01:55] <_nickel> todd_: I'll sort through them today and stay on top of them in the future
[10:02:08] <kinblas> todd_: You still up for testing the transitions branch on WebOS, Nokia, and WP7?
[10:07:23] <kinblas> _nickel: so for the unit tests, the HTML markup doesn't need a qunit-fixture div around everything right?
[10:26:04] <_nickel> kinblas: no, and in some cases we actually have to avoid it because of the enhancement
[10:27:08] <_nickel> kinblas: actually one issue is that it removes the altered DOM which destroys the associated data
[10:27:16] * _nickel is remembering
[10:27:32] <_nickel> so I'm not sure we can do it at all since we tack the data onto the elements themselves
[10:27:45] <_nickel> unless we re-enhance after every test
[10:28:43] <_nickel> and then there's the hash managmeent in the case where we replace the dom because the dom won't represent the same thing as the hash
[10:28:49] <_nickel> kinblas: its a rabbit hole
[10:30:35] <kinblas> heh
[10:30:56] <kinblas> ok I was just wondering because I noticed a couple of the tests had t
[10:31:01] <kinblas> it
[10:40:16] <_nickel> kinblas: todd_: which of our buildfiles is latest created from?
[10:44:10] <_nickel> kinblas: gseguin: todd_ https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2275
[10:47:48] * kinblas likes _nickel's issue
[12:56:22] <todd_> good issue _nickel
[12:56:26] <todd_> you volunteering?
[12:56:38] <_nickel> indeed
[12:56:41] <todd_> kinblas - i'm working on the blog post, then I can do some testing for sure
[12:56:45] <_nickel> did I not assign it to me?
[12:56:51] <todd_> nope :)
[12:56:55] * _nickel is silly
[12:57:11] <todd_> i took care of that
[12:57:12] <_nickel> todd_: thanks
[12:58:22] <todd_> _nickel - what would be the best commit and description for the select re-factor?
[12:58:26] <todd_> for hte blog
[13:06:33] <todd_> _nickel - what were the names of the guys working on list filtering?
[13:07:07] <_nickel> todd_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2006
[13:08:35] <todd_> thanks!
[13:11:03] <_nickel> todd_: I tried to be diplomatic, I felt super bad about killing that long thread
[13:11:08] <_nickel> s/,/./
[13:13:57] <todd_> you were nice
[13:13:59] <todd_> i wanted to thank them
[13:14:15] <todd_> oh, so what would be a good commit to point to for the custom select
[13:14:21] <todd_> and is ther edocs on how these work now?
[13:16:41] <_nickel> todd_: I don't think we meant it to be published way to extend the select widget
[13:17:01] <_nickel> I didn't do any documenting
[13:17:06] <_nickel> I can certainly do that now actually
[13:17:24] <todd_> sure
[13:17:58] <todd_> but since the native and custom selects are decoupled, we can explain how to save size by not including the custom script and how hte options work with and without
[13:18:08] <_nickel> todd_: I guess we want to tell people they don't have to use the custom select if they don't want to?
[13:18:13] <_nickel> :D
[13:18:25] <todd_> yeah, that
[13:18:52] <todd_> since you need to opt in anyway, most people may not need those 800 lines of code for custom menus
[13:19:54] <_nickel> there's at least one option thats not necessary for custom selects
[13:20:04] <_nickel> that might be the only one though
[13:20:14] <_nickel> menuPageTheme
[13:20:30] <_nickel> err
[13:20:33] <_nickel> not necessary for native selects
[13:20:35] <_nickel> todd_: ^
[13:21:52] <todd_> right
[13:22:21] <todd_> but now that there are two separate plugins, should we consider documenting them separately
[13:22:51] <todd_> the native select menu is the core version, then we have an optional extension that adds custom menus with their addiitonal options
[13:24:14] <todd_> so other than the listview filter callback, did any land that would be considered major?
[13:30:41] <kinblas> _nickel: remember how we were talking about adding a unit/transition directory?
[13:30:49] <_nickel> kinblas: yessir
[13:31:00] <kinblas> turns out there is already a unit/navigation/navigation_transitions.js
[13:31:02] <kinblas> test
[13:31:13] <_nickel> feel free to move them out
[13:31:17] <_nickel> thats what scott was joking about
[13:31:36] <kinblas> ah right, so he wants to turn off transitions for the navigation tests so they run faster
[13:31:44] <_nickel> yep :D
[13:31:44] <kinblas> and we can do that if we move those tests out
[13:31:48] <_nickel> I think so
[13:31:49] <kinblas> okie dokie
[13:32:01] <_nickel> kinblas: have you tried /tests/unit/ locally?
[13:32:06] <_nickel> I'm curious if it works
[13:32:14] <kinblas> locally as in localhost .. yes
[13:32:17] <_nickel> yes
[13:32:21] <kinblas> I'm doing that now
[13:32:24] <_nickel> I made some modifications
[13:32:30] <_nickel> to report the results
[13:32:34] <_nickel> but also the clean up the runner
[13:32:35] <kinblas> ??
[13:32:56] <_nickel> it now reports the passed/failed from the iframe suite
[13:33:37] <_nickel> I'm still trying to sort out why QUnit runs the first test before the whole test suite is defined on jquerymobile.com/test/tests/unit/
[13:34:14] <kinblas> oh, you mean running from tests/unit/
[13:34:17] <_nickel> yes
[13:34:18] <_nickel> kinblas: http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/unit/runner.js
[13:34:19] <kinblas> yeah that doesn't work for me
[13:34:25] <kinblas> it records nothing
[13:34:30] <kinblas> so everything is green
[13:34:31] <todd_> new blog post: http://jquerymobile.com/blog/2011/08/12/team-update-week-of-aug-8/
[13:34:34] <kinblas> I thought that was odd
[13:34:38] <todd_> kinblas - i'll test now
[13:37:36] <_nickel> todd_: nice shoutout to those guys
[13:37:40] <_nickel> classy
[13:38:12] <_nickel> kinblas: that link is just to see that its significantly cleaned up :D
[13:38:39] <_nickel> kinblas: it doesn't work locally?
[13:39:01] <kinblas> _nickel: duh, I forgot I'm on a branch
[13:39:04] <kinblas> so it doesn't have your fixes
[13:39:10] <_nickel> it won't fix that
[13:39:17] * _nickel shakes his fist at QUnit
[13:39:39] <_nickel> I need to look at the QUnit internals to sort out why its starting early
[13:39:47] * _nickel goes off to do that in anger and frustration
[13:39:55] <kinblas> _nickel: on the branch all I get is "Tests completed in 42 milliseconds"
[13:39:57] * _nickel notes that its most likely his fault
[13:40:00] <kinblas> I can hardly believe that
[13:40:06] <_nickel> yah thats not right
[13:40:20] <kinblas> _nickel: let me pull HEAD on localhost and try it there
[13:40:34] <_nickel> I wish I could repro locally
[13:40:43] <_nickel> its really hard to debug on the server lol
[13:43:12] <todd_> thanks _nickel. nobody ever calls me classy
[13:43:29] <_nickel> todd_: you seem like a classy guy to me Todd!
[13:43:44] <todd_> i'm not wearing pants right now
[13:43:49] <todd_> that sounds classy to you?
[13:43:59] <todd_> i'm at starbucks
[13:44:08] <todd_> :p
[13:44:27] <todd_> so kin - i need to test origin/transitions
[13:44:41] <todd_> or transitions (ref/heads/transitions)
[13:44:48] <kinblas> todd_: right, but you must wear pants when you do
[13:44:50] <todd_> garbdlygood to me
[13:45:00] <kinblas> origin/transitions
[13:45:04] <todd_> (zippin gup)
[13:45:06] <todd_> ok
[13:45:18] <todd_> and you had good iOS and Android coverage
[13:45:21] <todd_> right?
[13:45:44] <todd_> I need to do WebOS, BB6 + tablet
[13:46:19] <kinblas> if good is testing on a total of 4 Android devices: HTC Incredible (android 2.2), Droid X (Android 2.1), Motorola Xoom (3.1), and Droid 2 Global (2.2)
[13:46:53] <todd_> ok so i should test nexus s (2.3)
[13:47:03] <todd_> and galaxy tab (honeycomb)
[13:47:08] <kinblas> also tested on iPad 4.3.5 and iPod 4.2.1
[13:47:37] <todd_> ok. i have an old iphone
[13:47:42] <todd_> original baby
[13:47:44] <kinblas> todd_: the Xoom is HoneyComb, but it doesn't hurt to try on more than one device
[13:47:48] <todd_> sure
[13:48:08] <kinblas> also, we *still* don't have a BB Playbook
[13:48:10] * kinblas sighs
[13:48:32] <todd_> i have 2
[13:48:43] <todd_> nah nah
[13:49:08] <kinblas> _nickel: just pulled the head into localhost ... it executes even faster ... 21 milliseconds
[13:49:22] <_nickel> kinblas: yah I think I've sorted out the issue
[13:49:39] <_nickel> kinblas: I need to tell QUnit to wait on starting the test suite until I've defined all my tests
[13:49:39] <kinblas> http://localhost/jqm/tests/unit/ is what I loaded
[13:49:49] <_nickel> *which* is what I figured the issue was
[13:50:03] <_nickel> the docs just aren't helpful in terms of setting that up
[13:50:06] <_nickel> code spelunking now
[13:51:01] <todd_> boy, the playbook is horribe at animations
[13:51:16] <todd_> i keep hearing from them that we're not doing a good job on transitions
[13:51:33] <todd_> but neither KF or Tr work on this thing
[13:52:01] <todd_> master (KF), you see a 2 frame animation for slides on playbook
[13:52:15] <todd_> on Tr branch, you don't see anything
[13:52:39] <todd_> pop and fade are both slightly better (a few frames), but similiar
[13:52:58] <todd_> id say this is a tiny bit worse, but it's pretty useless to start
[13:59:28] <todd_> the old palm pixi running webOS 1.4 is way better
[14:02:19] <todd_> going to call webOS parity
[14:13:02] <todd_> webOS 2.0 is at parity
[14:15:36] <todd_> original iPhone is at parity (=no transitions)
[14:16:54] <todd_> BB6 is at parity
[14:25:41] <todd_> in my honeycomb tablet, there is that annoying blink to the last page on animation complete
[14:25:44] <todd_> but you knew that
[14:26:42] <todd_> android is GARBAGE. there, said it.
[14:26:59] <_nickel> I wonder if we could use the mechanical turk for device testing
[14:27:04] <gseguin> lol
[14:27:13] <todd_> that would be nice
[14:27:21] <todd_> i'm shocked at how bad android and BB are
[14:27:28] <gseguin> hey todd_: thanks for the credit on the blog post
[14:27:32] <todd_> compared to iOS and WebOS
[14:27:40] <todd_> no prob. my pleasure
[14:27:46] <todd_> i need to add the logo to the homepage
[14:28:13] <todd_> i need to do one for adobe next
[14:28:25] <todd_> jive was just way behind - no logo no props
[14:29:24] <gseguin> no worries
[14:29:24] <todd_> kinblas - what else can i test?
[14:29:42] <kinblas> todd_: in terms of platforms?
[14:29:47] <todd_> ya
[14:30:02] <kinblas> WebOS, WP7, Symbian, iOS (just a sanity check)
[14:30:07] <kinblas> BlackBerry
[14:30:14] <kinblas> I only have a torch running 6
[14:30:20] <kinblas> and it is sloooooooooooow
[14:30:38] <todd_> it is!
[14:30:46] <kinblas> oh I didn't test on Opera Mini ... and Mobile
[14:30:50] <kinblas> i probably should
[14:31:01] * kinblas throws another thing on the pile
[14:31:21] <todd_> does this have the moz and or opera rules in?
[14:35:06] <todd_> looks like no
[14:35:12] <todd_> ff mobile is fine, but no transitions
[14:35:37] <todd_> kin - can you take a look at why the dialog in the page transition demo page has the wrong color for the bg layer?
[14:35:51] <todd_> it's yellow, should be black. inheritance issue?
[14:36:36] <kinblas> is this on /test?
[14:36:41] <kinblas> or in the branch?
[14:37:02] <kinblas> todd_: yes it has the moz and o rules
[14:37:47] <todd_> hmmm...right the ff mobile doesn't support that yet
[14:37:58] <todd_> just desktop
[14:38:43] <kinblas> todd_: I see the yellow background on /test/
[14:38:56] <kinblas> so it's not related to transitions
[14:39:07] <kinblas> but I'll look where it's getting it
[14:39:21] <todd_> yeah, it's in master
[14:39:26] <todd_> look bad
[14:39:56] <todd_> i think that we decided to not add the -o transiton rules until opera improved things
[14:40:04] <todd_> it's crazy slow
[14:40:05] <kinblas> todd_: it's getting it from ui-body-e
[14:40:21] <todd_> like 5-10 seconds of hanging
[14:40:41] <todd_> but is that on the page div for that dialog?
[14:40:46] <kinblas> todd_: you see that tweet from @MW_Collins?
[14:40:51] <kinblas> I pinged him for specifics
[14:40:59] <todd_> in any case, we need to set the cover div to be black and not inherit fromt eh body
[14:41:02] <todd_> nope
[14:41:29] <kinblas> todd_: check #jquerymobile and you'll see it :-)
[14:41:55] <kinblas> todd_: the dialog div has data-theme="e" on it
[14:42:13] <todd_> so you think it's just a markup issue?
[14:42:25] <todd_> i think we should still safeguard this a bit
[14:42:50] <todd_> the cover div should always be black. this is a docoupling inheritance thing that cropped up
[14:43:03] <todd_> because the markup is the same but not it looks wonky
[14:43:19] <todd_> btw - saw that tweet
[14:43:28] <kinblas> todd_: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/transition-success.html
[14:43:32] <kinblas> it's in the markup for the dialog
[14:44:06] <todd_> right, but i think we tell people they can set the theme on the page or content
[14:44:29] <todd_> if you add it to the page, it should ripple into the content
[14:44:42] <todd_> but the overlay layer isn't part of the page really
[14:44:46] <todd_> it sits under it
[14:44:51] <kinblas> oh heh
[14:45:01] <todd_> just saying other people may use this markup
[14:45:10] <kinblas> but how do you specify the swatch for the overlay if its generated?
[14:45:15] * kinblas smells an option
[14:45:27] <todd_> the overlay layer?
[14:45:28] <kinblas> data-overlay-theme="a"
[14:45:32] <_nickel> kinblas: oh yah! http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/unit/
[14:45:44] <todd_> i think we just hard code this
[14:45:57] <todd_> zippy
[14:46:08] <kinblas> _nickel: \oo/
[14:46:12] <todd_> so on transitions, it looks like parity to me
[14:46:32] <kinblas> todd_: just as blinky as before?
[14:46:36] <todd_> not much better, but will eventually be more compatible (FF and Opera Mobile)
[14:46:44] <todd_> seems about the same
[14:46:56] <todd_> what did you do to mitiage blinkiness?
[14:46:58] <kinblas> todd_: I think folks are going to be might disappointed
[14:47:23] <todd_> i sort of agree
[14:47:43] <kinblas> _nickel: is that really the state of things? 5 modules are failing
[14:47:44] <todd_> the issue seems to be less with the css prop used for the transitions
[14:47:52] <todd_> but the scrolling up/down
[14:47:52] <kinblas> _nickel: can we default to errors closed?
[14:48:20] <kinblas> todd_: yeah we are doing a lot of things that are causing reflows and repaints
[14:48:22] <todd_> all that scrolling causes lag and blinks
[14:48:31] <kinblas> werd
[14:48:36] <todd_> but it's needed w/ the way we do things
[14:48:58] <todd_> scott had a cool demo using iOS overflow to make transitions and headers pretty much perfect
[14:49:03] <todd_> in iOS 5
[14:49:18] <kinblas> yeah it's perfect because nothing exceeds the height of the viewport
[14:49:22] <todd_> right
[14:49:34] <kinblas> we get that with scrollview too :-
[14:49:35] <kinblas> :-P
[14:49:40] <todd_> we do, we do
[14:49:52] <kinblas> can't wait till everyone supports overflow:scroll
[14:49:58] <todd_> ideally, we'd work this out so we'd use native overflow
[14:50:07] <todd_> then scrollview as the polyfill
[14:50:24] <todd_> then the current way as the 3rd option where scrollview would break things (webOS, BB)
[14:50:41] <todd_> want to take a look at figuring that one out?
[14:50:59] <kinblas> which? The 3 tier support?
[14:51:05] <todd_> yeah
[14:51:16] <todd_> refine scott's branch for ios 5
[14:51:40] <kinblas> hmmm, I'd like to clear the transitions first ... so we can say, "look, this is the best we can do for CSS3 animations"
[14:51:42] <todd_> then see how to apply scrollview in as a polyfill where it won't cause itssues
[14:51:49] <todd_> oh sure
[14:51:57] <todd_> this is just the next step
[14:52:10] <kinblas> unfortunately the polyfill will only work on iOS
[14:52:10] <todd_> so i don't see any issues with landing this
[14:52:14] <todd_> in my testing
[14:52:26] <kinblas> since android still has the touchstart/scroll bug
[14:52:29] <todd_> it just doesn't relaly improve things mcuh
[14:52:35] <todd_> right
[14:52:51] <todd_> so when iOS 5 lands in a few weeks, most people will upgrade who can
[14:53:02] <kinblas> The only thing that would be cross-platform is to introduce a scrolling overlay (aka touch scrollbar at the sides)
[14:53:02] <todd_> so that's why that is a much better path IMHO
[14:53:11] <todd_> ?
[14:53:14] <kinblas> where it is catching and canceling things, and not the content
[14:53:26] <kinblas> todd_: think scrollbars :-)
[14:53:33] <todd_> oh, hmmm
[14:53:45] <todd_> that seems too obtrusive
[14:54:03] <todd_> even tho i agree it would work in more places
[14:54:22] <kinblas> more importantly that would work on Android and keep form elements functional
[14:54:29] <todd_> so in your opinion, scrollview is only viable on iOS - not Android or other platforms?
[14:55:11] <kinblas> scrollview is fast on Android when it is in scrollto mode (using window.scrollto)
[14:55:29] <todd_> but that only works for content, not forms?
[14:55:45] <kinblas> what makes it non-viable is the fact that they require you to cancel touchstart to kill the browser native scrolling
[14:56:12] <todd_> right
[14:56:13] <kinblas> form elements are still old school
[14:56:21] <kinblas> they require mouse events to function properly
[14:56:23] <todd_> that's why all the JS scrolling are so tricky
[14:56:49] <kinblas> canceling touchstart prevents mouse events from being synthesized so no mousedown, means no focus, means no workie.
[14:57:10] <kinblas> that's why I think iOS placed the scroll cancel on the mousemove
[14:57:39] <kinblas> whoever implemented touch events for android made a big mistake by placing the scroll cancel code on touchstart
[14:57:44] <kinblas> they are the only ones that do that
[14:57:50] <kinblas> BB and Apple do it on touchmove
[14:58:03] <kinblas> not sure about WebOS
[14:58:16] <kinblas> but I suspect they do it on touchmove too
[15:01:33] <kinblas> _nickel: so is the HEAD really in bad shape? I re-ran the unit tests off HEAD and the same 5 tests consistently fail.
[15:04:49] <kinblas> _nickel: on localhost, tests/unit/ doesn't run at all, timing problem?
[15:05:01] <kinblas> I am in sync with the HEAD btw
[15:07:32] <kinblas> for unit/navigation tests 20-24 and 29-74 all fail
[15:15:06] <_nickel> the test suite runner tends to expose time sensitive tests
[15:16:22] <_nickel> kinblas: I'm not seeing any nav test failures, are you in FF?
[15:17:57] <kinblas> Safari
[15:18:03] <kinblas> windows
[15:18:09] * kinblas tries FF
[15:25:49] <_nickel> kinblas: I think the story here is that we have a couple of suites that are fragile
[15:28:56] <kinblas> I'm seeing failures in FF too though only a couple
[15:30:36] * _nickel is glad to see the failures
[15:30:53] <_nickel> I'll address those next
[16:08:09] <kinblas> _nickel: ping
[16:19:28] <kinblas> _nickel: I was looking at the transition tests, and it seems that some of the "ok" tests can be combined under a single test() call ... are they separated out so that they get "top-level-billing" in the test output?
[16:48:35] <_nickel> kinblas: for documentation purposes
[16:48:53] <_nickel> kinblas: alternately you can supply the description test to QUnit.ok
[16:49:02] <_nickel> *text
[16:49:17] <_nickel> either way really
