[09:17:23] <toddparker> yikes
[09:17:28] <toddparker> running out of time
[09:37:01] * gseguin blames irssi for not seeing todd's message
[09:37:08] <gseguin> hey toddparker
[09:37:34] <gseguin> saw your update on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2017

[10:57:40] <toddparker> yea gseguin
[11:01:39] <toddparker> hey all meeting now!
[11:20:10] <kinblas> toddparker: give this a whirl on the galaxy tab ... http://bit.ly/e4TqEC
[11:37:55] <kinblas> toddparker: actually I have 2 trees, one that is what is actually checked into transitions branch and an experimental one that uses off-screen. The link above is the latter.
[11:40:26] <kinblas> The link for the current transitions branch is here:
[11:40:27] <kinblas> http://bit.ly/r2dJmB
[11:40:43] <kinblas> off-screen experiment is here:
[11:40:51] <kinblas> http://bit.ly/e4TqEC
[12:11:33] <toddparker> thanks kinblas, i'll test
[12:11:46] <kinblas> toddparker: thanks
[14:31:25] <toddparker> kinblas - no problem
[14:31:41] <toddparker> at least you know they are consistent and you're making forward strides
[14:31:47] <toddparker> this is much better than master
[14:37:42] <toddparker> iPad running 4.3
[14:37:43] <toddparker> No difference spotted between these 3 links, all buttery smooth with no blinks
[14:38:07] <kinblas> toddparker: thanks for testing!
[14:41:55] <toddparker> do you have a playbook?
[14:43:26] <toddparker> the playbook on master whups any honeycomb tablet
[14:43:34] <toddparker> and RIM isn't happy with perf
[14:43:47] <toddparker> does Google even care, really?
[14:43:58] <peol> i got access to iPad 4.3.5/5.0, playbook, xoom etc. at work, ping me if you need something tested tomorrow
[14:44:19] <peol> or rather, email peolanha@gmail, i don't have access to irc at work
[14:45:39] <toddparker> thanks peol
[14:45:58] <toddparker> i have a playbook, wasn't sure if kinblas had one
[14:46:16] <kinblas> toddparker: that's a negative
[14:46:22] <toddparker> ok
[14:46:32] <kinblas> toddparker: so jqm is slow on the playbook?
[14:46:33] <peol> kk, it was more a 'fyi' if something comes up :)
[14:46:41] <kinblas> peol: thanks!
[15:01:33] <toddparker> not compared to honeycomb
[15:01:36] <toddparker> just finsihed testing
[15:01:50] <toddparker> your latest jQM2 is much better than master
[15:01:57] <toddparker> feeling a lot better about thsi switch now
[15:02:08] <toddparker> seeing better perf on a few platforms
[15:02:15] <toddparker> iOS is already as good as can be
[15:12:48] <toddparker> oh, the opacity on the box shadow doesn't seem to have any effect
[15:16:25] <toddparker> wrong window on that last comment
[15:17:04] <_nickel> kinblas: do you have that link to the wc3 doc that included the body element propertes
[15:17:18] <_nickel> kinblas: this bug behaves differently when the same markup is on the body
[15:17:27] <_nickel> so I want to know in what way its treated differently
[15:17:39] <_nickel> or rather *may* be treated differently
[15:17:53] <kinblas> it was the html4 dtd
[15:17:56] <kinblas> hang on a sec
[15:18:08] <_nickel> kinblas: got it
[15:18:28] <kinblas> http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/sgml/dtd.html
[15:18:35] <_nickel> thanks
[15:19:16] <kinblas> _nickel: I don't think you're going to find what you need there
[15:19:23] <_nickel> kinblas: neither do
[15:19:28] <_nickel> I
[15:19:30] <kinblas> it's just a fact that body is a *special* container
[15:19:37] <_nickel> yah
[15:19:43] <_nickel> digh
[15:19:44] <_nickel> *sigh
[15:19:55] <_nickel> freudian slip directed at android
[15:19:59] <kinblas> heh
[15:20:02] <kinblas> digh kin digh
[15:20:06] <_nickel> lol
[15:20:09] <_nickel> negative ghost rider
