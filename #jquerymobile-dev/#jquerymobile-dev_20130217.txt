[00:24:57] <vick08> Hi, wanted to ask regarding issue 5650: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5650
[00:25:51] <vick08> This is regarding ARIA landmarks that are inserted as attributes and cannot be toggled via mobileinit, for example.

[02:51:17] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: +1 to search enter/arrow down key focus on first list item... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3303
[02:53:26] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: search bar animation is choppy indeed, just used a height animation for the idea for now but we shouldn't use that
[02:54:17] <uGoMobi> will trigger the cear btn if you close the search bar
[02:58:21] <uGoMobi> clear*

[04:17:48] <toddmparker> Hi uGoMobi 
[04:17:58] <uGoMobi> morning toddmparker 
[04:18:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: switching to your new icons now
[04:22:12] <toddmparker___> cool
[04:22:26] <toddmparker___> was gonna do it, but figured you'd do it better

[04:25:54] <uGoMobi> ok now a proper animation for the search bar
[04:27:20] <toddmparker___> the animation just need to go to a fixed height?
[04:28:12] <uGoMobi> I think it's better to use keyframes instead of transition
[04:28:50] <uGoMobi> don't like to use fixed height because textinput size might be bit different across browsers
[04:28:56] <toddmparker___> true
[04:29:56] <uGoMobi> hmm i see a second vertical scrollbar while the reveal menu opens
[04:30:16] <uGoMobi> also see that issue when you close it on iOS
[04:31:09] <uGoMobi> removed some old CSS for the overlay top margin already
[04:35:08] <toddmparker___> good
[04:35:13] <toddmparker___> working on tweaking icons
[04:35:23] <toddmparker___> search felt too small

[04:52:19] <toddmparker___> i'd like the bar icon to sit to the right of the logo, used a crappy % margin jus tot preview it
[04:52:34] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: ah ok
[04:53:02] <toddmparker___> when the panel opens, might be nice to have the x appear just to the right of the panel instead of swapping the bars
[04:53:09] <toddmparker___> ^^ this is all at wider widths
[04:53:18] <toddmparker___> phone is great
[04:54:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: agreed, we make it a close button at the top next to panel
[04:54:38] <toddmparker___> right!

[05:13:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I tried with keyframes but still very choppy on iOS
[05:14:09] <uGoMobi> I think it's just too much because of the 3D-ing we do for the panel
[05:15:00] <uGoMobi> I think it's also a good to show people that you can't just do everything when you develop for mobile :)

[05:16:38] <toddmparker___> hide show?
[05:17:06] <toddmparker___> might feel just as good, faster anyway
[05:17:12] <uGoMobi> yeah now it's just display none/block
[05:17:17] <toddmparker___> we can always revisit that later
[05:17:19] <toddmparker___> yep
[05:18:14] <uGoMobi> do you want the search field at the right and always visible on wider screens?
[05:18:21] <toddmparker___> let's get the other things done, the animation isn't important
[05:18:27] <uGoMobi> or just keep it the same as for mobile?
[05:18:31] <toddmparker___> think so, yes. you agree?
[05:18:39] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:18:50] <agcolom> toddmparker___: should I use showcase instead of center on the api landing page? (http://stage.api.jquerymobile.com/)
[05:18:58] <toddmparker___> cool. want to make the header look different on larger screens
[05:19:14] <toddmparker___> hi agcolom 
[05:19:24] <toddmparker___> i can change my blurb to center
[05:19:29] <toddmparker___> might be better
[05:19:36] <agcolom> hi :-)

[05:20:26] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 146564565 15toddparker: Demos: Demo center, not showcase text edit
[05:20:47] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: i wonder if we should just go ahead and replace the docs folder with demos content and swap the homepage
[05:20:57] <toddmparker___> we have a backup of the docs
[05:21:18] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: ok let's do that
[05:21:50] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: any changes you want to commit first?
[05:22:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: otherwise I move them now
[05:22:20] <uGoMobi> have to change a few other files to not break the build
[05:23:13] <toddmparker___> oh, gotcha. wasn't sure if we ended up changing the build stuff
[05:23:26] <uGoMobi> only thing is that links to old doc files will be broken until we move to view.jquerymobile.com and do a redirect for /test/
[05:23:57] <toddmparker___> true
[05:24:12] <toddmparker___> but these are links to a dev url
[05:24:43] <uGoMobi> yeah
[05:25:03] <uGoMobi> would be nice to already see that things just work
[05:25:08] <uGoMobi> not wait until last moment
[05:25:29] <toddmparker___> yeah, i'm worried about that. like to live with things for a while
[05:25:51] <uGoMobi> ok I move them
[05:26:03] <toddmparker___> so a deep link to a page on test demos...if we switched to the new structure would that go to the index page or a 404?
[05:26:10] <toddmparker___> think we should
[05:26:22] <uGoMobi> index page
[05:27:02] <uGoMobi>   jquerymobile.com/test/any-folder-or-file will be redirected to view.jquerymobile.com/
[05:28:54] <toddmparker___> but today, no
[05:29:00] <toddmparker___> eventually, yes
[05:29:19] <toddmparker___> so if today, people get bounced to the index page, that's fine

[06:07:26] <toddmparker> agcolom: That mean the API docs are all set for 1.3?
[06:10:07] <agcolom> yes, I'm getting ready :-)
[06:10:28] <agcolom> I've changed the footer, but it's not on the live version for some reason..
[06:10:56] <agcolom> I've asked Adam and Scott G so hopefully we'll be ready for tomorrow
[06:11:24] <agcolom> I'll be busy with work stuff tomorrow but should be back around 10pm (so 5pm your time)
[06:11:39] <toddmparker> Cool
[06:11:50] <agcolom> which is why I want to do as much as  possible today... (and still working on my presentation as well !)
[06:12:27] <toddmparker> We're probably going to release 1.3 sooner so if you can get the API in presentable format tonight
[06:12:35] <toddmparker> That would be ideal
[06:12:45] <agcolom> Sure. 
[06:12:51] <toddmparker> I still have to dig into my preso
[06:12:58] <toddmparker> Too much going on!
[06:13:22] <agcolom> So then I should update all the examples then... but they will be broken until 1.3.0 is tagged and live...
[06:13:39] <agcolom> (as they would use 1.3.0)
[06:13:48] <agcolom> (which I guess does not exist yet)
[06:18:41] <toddmparker> Yes, I guess so
[06:18:55] <toddmparker> If you can't do it tomorrow 
[06:19:12] <toddmparker> But maybe wait until as late as possible to push and tag
[06:19:30] <agcolom> yes, good idea.

[08:26:23] <uGoMobi> it's a bit of a poor man redirect for the links to old docs but it works
[08:27:50] <uGoMobi> we have to keep those old folders until we move to view.jquerymobile.com and all links to /test/ can be redirected
[08:31:51] <toddmparker> Ok
[08:32:22] <toddmparker> Great work 
[08:32:39] <uGoMobi> thanks
[08:32:46] <toddmparker> So what's next?
[08:32:49] <uGoMobi> we have to give this page some love http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/widgets/headers/bars-fixed.html
[08:33:19] <toddmparker> Ok, I can look at that 
[08:33:24] <uGoMobi> I will go on with the search tool and header icons
[08:33:37] <toddmparker> Sounds good
[08:33:51] <uGoMobi> will start with menu icon location and close icon for panel
[08:33:59] <toddmparker> Auto focusing into the input when you open it will make a big difference on phones
[08:34:28] <toddmparker> New demo stuff is so much better
[08:34:32] <uGoMobi> yes will add a line to the toggle script for that
[08:34:41] <uGoMobi> it sure is
[08:35:05] <uGoMobi> that's why it is nice to work on this
[08:35:42] <toddmparker> This will set a good example for how to finesse and customize the library
[08:36:11] <toddmparker> Might look at making the nav panel open all the time on really large screens 
[08:36:23] <toddmparker> Can play with that later
[08:36:43] <toddmparker> I've been using your search for all my nav

[08:37:47] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: when I was working on panel and added a wrapper for panel contents I was thinking you can absolute position the contents on screen at wider screens
[08:41:07] <uGoMobi> so you should be able to do something like this http://developer.vimeo.com/apis/advanced/methods for the sections panel menu for example
[08:41:24] <uGoMobi> maybe later :)
[08:47:59] <toddmparker> That would be slick 
[08:48:39] <toddmparker> First things first
[08:59:58] <toddmparker> Snowy day here
[09:01:19] <uGoMobi> ah again
[09:01:32] <uGoMobi> I hope it doesn't get as bad as week ago
[09:03:24] <toddmparker> Nah, maybe 6-8"
[09:03:37] <toddmparker> We got over 2 feet before
[09:05:03] <ryanneufeld> I haven't seen that kind of snowfall in over 10 years
[09:05:37] <toddmparker> Lucky
[09:06:16] <uGoMobi> yeah you sure don't want that every winter
[09:06:43] <ryanneufeld> where i grew up we'd get 6-10 inches daily for a few days
[09:06:53] <ryanneufeld> but that hasn't happened in close to 15 years now
[09:06:58] <ryanneufeld> global warming :(
[09:07:09] <ryanneufeld> I didn't enjoy it, but I liked snowmobiling
[09:15:03] <toddmparker> Fun
[09:15:22] <toddmparker> Weather is off
[09:42:28] <toddmparker> Seems like links in the search aren't resolving

[10:15:58] <toddmparker> Good one
[10:31:14] <toddmparker> Search still seems broken on test...you seeing that?
[10:33:11] <uGoMobi> errr yeah I see it
[10:37:05] <uGoMobi> there is a 500 error ... scripts don't work
[10:38:26] <uGoMobi> only on the homepage scripts are loaded
[10:38:43] <ryanneufeld> my ears are ringing
[10:39:10] <uGoMobi> hey ryanneufeld 
[10:41:50] <ryanneufeld> I saw 500 error 
[10:42:00] <ryanneufeld> thought I'd see if you needed any help
[10:42:13] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: thanks
[10:42:21] <uGoMobi> we are working on nw docs
[10:42:29] <ryanneufeld> are you having server issues?
[10:42:34] <uGoMobi> could use some help indeed
[10:42:49] <uGoMobi> I think the problem is in the build script
[10:43:02] <uGoMobi> I think I need to update something somewhere
[10:43:11] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/examples/
[10:43:31] <uGoMobi> if you go there and look at the errors
[10:44:03] <uGoMobi> looks like a file we create has some issues
[10:44:13] <uGoMobi> the combined JS file
[10:44:37] <ryanneufeld> yeah, looks borked
[10:46:18] <uGoMobi> we have a htaccess file to add handler html for php
[10:46:32] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: did you add something similar on the nginx server?
[10:46:43] <ryanneufeld> I did yes
[10:46:46] <uGoMobi> you were looking at that with arschmitz right?
[10:46:51] <ryanneufeld> I was
[10:47:36] <uGoMobi> not sure yet if the issue is related to that
[10:47:57] <uGoMobi> still don't get the whole picture of our build process
[10:48:09] <ryanneufeld> I can see part of the problem
[10:48:16] <ryanneufeld> http://jquerymobile.com/test/js/
[10:48:23] <ryanneufeld> it's trying to load that as a js file
[10:48:37] <uGoMobi> right, that shouldn't be an html file
[10:48:50] <ryanneufeld> 	<script src="../_assets/js"></script>
[10:48:50] <ryanneufeld> 	<script src="../../js"></script>
[10:48:58] <ryanneufeld> those are directories
[10:49:12] <ryanneufeld> so it's giving you a directory listing
[10:49:19] <uGoMobi> right
[10:49:28] <ryanneufeld> and then this one is http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/_assets/js/
[10:49:31] <ryanneufeld> a 500 error
[10:49:33] <uGoMobi> but there is a php file
[10:49:51] <uGoMobi> to combine the files ini the directory
[10:50:00] <ryanneufeld>  /test is proxied right?> 
[10:50:04] <uGoMobi> yes
[10:50:11] <ryanneufeld> where to?
[10:50:18] <uGoMobi> folder docs on master
[10:50:19] <ryanneufeld> builder.jquerymobile?
[10:50:32] <uGoMobi> but the homepage is in the root
[10:50:48] <uGoMobi> the index of folder docs contains a redirect in the header
[10:51:15] <uGoMobi> I dunno if it's builder.jquerymobile
[10:52:09] * ryanneufeld checks
[10:52:12] <uGoMobi> things do work local
[10:52:59] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: ah I get it
[10:53:18] <uGoMobi> those links to those folders should be replaced during build process
[10:53:51] <ryanneufeld> oic
[10:53:54] <ryanneufeld> and it's not happening

[11:01:09] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: I still get the 500
[11:01:13] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[11:01:20] <ryanneufeld> I see it too
[11:01:24] <ryanneufeld> checking logs
[11:01:25] <ryanneufeld> sec
[11:04:22] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: it's only in a problem in one subdir
[11:04:41] <uGoMobi> only here http://builder.jquerymobile.com/test/docs/examples/
[11:06:33] <ryanneufeld> I'm not seeing the error in the logs
[11:06:50] <ryanneufeld> or if it's there I'm not seeing it cause it's getting spammed by 404s
[11:07:13] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:07:14] <ryanneufeld> [17-Feb-2013 19:07:07 UTC] PHP Fatal error:  require_once(): Failed opening required '../../../combine.php' (include_path='.:/usr/share/php:/usr/share/pear') in /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/jQuery Mobile Latest/workspace/compiled/demos/docs/_assets/js/index.php on line 10
[11:07:16] <ryanneufeld> there we go
[11:07:37] <ryanneufeld> there's your problem
[11:09:13] <uGoMobi> aha
[11:09:38] <ryanneufeld>  /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/jQuery Mobile Latest/workspace
[11:09:42] <ryanneufeld> is where that lives
[11:10:24] <ryanneufeld> that file looks like one I'
[11:10:29] <ryanneufeld> ve written in the past
[11:12:10] <uGoMobi> first we only used combine.php for the framework JS
[11:12:40] <ryanneufeld> not sure why it's being included though
[11:12:40] <uGoMobi> what changed is that we now use it to combine 4 JS files in our docs/_assets/js folder too
[11:13:01] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:14:08] <ryanneufeld> I see, and since your index.php file is the default
[11:14:14] <ryanneufeld> it should just echo the correct js
[11:14:21] <ryanneufeld> without needing an htaccess
[11:14:28] <ryanneufeld> clever solution
[11:15:05] <ryanneufeld> I gotta go afk for a bit, I can I assume that you can handle it from here?
[11:15:26] <ryanneufeld> if it comes down to it, just copy and paste what's in the combine.php into the index.php
[11:15:29] <ryanneufeld> and it should work just fine
[11:15:37] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: yeah I think I can figure it out... thanks a lot for your help!
[11:15:44] <ryanneufeld> np
[11:31:53] <toddmparker> Hey uGoMobi 
[11:32:00] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker 
[11:32:07] <toddmparker> At a birthday party so I'm offline-ish
[11:32:14] <toddmparker> How goes?
[11:32:47] <uGoMobi> still some issues with build/server
[11:32:59] <uGoMobi> :(
[11:34:08] <uGoMobi> will try a few more things and if it doesn't work I leave it for now and go on with header and search stuff
[11:34:43] <uGoMobi> and ask the other guys for help tomorrow
[11:35:27] <ryanneufeld> uGoMobi: were you able to get the php thing sorted?
[11:36:32] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: not really, even when I just paste the php in that index file I see an issue
[11:36:41] <ryanneufeld> What's the issue?
[11:36:43] <uGoMobi> see it local too now
[11:37:18] <uGoMobi> a script that is in that comined script doesn't run
[11:37:48] <uGoMobi> script to manipulate href's of links
[11:38:49] <ryanneufeld> this live right now?
[11:40:13] <uGoMobi> I didn't push any changes yet
[11:40:20] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:41:33] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: is http://builder.jquerymobile.com/test/ an apache or nginx server?
[11:41:39] <ryanneufeld> nginx
[11:41:42] <ryanneufeld> and php-fpm
[11:42:05] <ryanneufeld> the logs are in /var/log/php-fpm/error.log
[11:42:12] <ryanneufeld> that's where I found the php error
[11:42:29] <uGoMobi> ok so it just ignores htaccess files
[11:43:01] <ryanneufeld> completely
[11:45:35] <uGoMobi> it could be I created a race condition somewhere
[11:46:42] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I gotta run uGoMobi, but ping gnarf if you need more help. Looks like he's active today
[11:46:57] <uGoMobi> ryanneufeld: ok, thanks again
[11:48:11] <gnarf> yeah
[11:48:18] <gnarf> im semi-afk a bit tho
[11:48:24] <gnarf> working on getting view.* to handle the php
[11:48:35] <gnarf> when i get back
[11:53:19] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Seems like it might be more productive to work on the header if you can at least test locally

[12:02:29] <uGoMobi> that failure wasn't me
[12:03:03] <uGoMobi> :(
[12:25:14] <uGoMobi> bbiab
[12:52:51] <gnarf> so um
[12:52:57] <gnarf> uGoMobi / toddmparker / anyone
[12:53:08] <uGoMobi> hey gnarf 
[12:53:11] <gnarf> builder.jquerymobile.com has .html listed as one of the extensions to run php on
[12:53:16] <gnarf> you know why?
[12:53:23] <gnarf> can i remove that?
[12:53:44] <uGoMobi> gnarf: I know why and it can't be removed
[12:53:52] <gnarf> please share?
[12:53:56] <gnarf> so i can reference it
[12:54:01] <uGoMobi> we use php to include navmenu
[12:54:20] <gnarf> why not make the extensions .php on the files then?
[12:54:25] <uGoMobi> but our docs should be accessible without a server
[12:55:05] <gnarf> so you include a tag that breaks in plain .html?
[12:55:11] * gnarf shrugs
[12:55:30] <uGoMobi> gnarf: in the build the actual is parsed
[12:55:44] <uGoMobi> actual html*
[12:57:27] <uGoMobi> I mean the build of the zip that people can download
[12:57:34] <gnarf> yeah
[12:57:44] <gnarf> so couldn't it read from .php and output .html?
[12:57:47] <gnarf> in the build step?
[12:57:52] <gnarf> i mean, its broken for old tags forever
[12:58:01] <gnarf> so let me shake a fist at whoever came up with this setup
[12:58:17] <gnarf> because now i need to enable php parsing on every view.* site for .html ;)
[12:58:50] <gnarf> uGoMobi: http://stage.view.jquerymobile.com/master/
[12:58:53] <uGoMobi> you can shake a fist at arschmitz toddmparker and me :)
[12:59:10] <gnarf> http://stage.view.jquerymobile.com/1.2.0/
[12:59:26] <toddmparker> Hey, don't shake that at me
[12:59:38] <toddmparker> The local zip is important 
[12:59:38] <gnarf> uGoMobi: consider your self shook at then ... please make those .php files and have them build to .html in the packages - thx ;)
[13:00:04] <gnarf> if they have a <?php tag-- it should be .php not .html
[13:00:12] <toddmparker> Is there any other option?
[13:00:18] <uGoMobi> gnarf: but then it doesn't work if you test the repo local
[13:00:21] <uGoMobi> without build
[13:01:01] <gnarf> uGoMobi: jquery can't test without grunt
[13:01:10] <gnarf> there isn't even a jquery.js to reference without running grunt
[13:01:30] <gnarf> people who are "testing" should be able to build
[13:01:32] <gnarf> yes?
[13:01:38] <uGoMobi> sorry didn't mean test like test
[13:02:18] <uGoMobi> I mean that if you clone the repo you can browse the docs on your local xampp or whatever
[13:02:20] <gnarf> so you have to rename the links to .php and have your buildstep replace that with .html?
[13:02:31] <gnarf> when building the zip
[13:03:08] <gnarf> as it is right now "testing locally" isn't going to put .html files through the php parser anyway yeah?
[13:03:10] <uGoMobi> i see
[13:03:27] <gnarf> unless you also configure your local apache/whatever to handle html
[13:03:29] <gnarf> as php
[13:03:41] <uGoMobi> gnarf we added a htaccess for that
[13:04:24] <gnarf> and if your php has security_limits.extensions
[13:04:25] <gnarf> ?
[13:04:32] <gnarf> still blows up
[13:04:39] <gnarf> .htaccess is also apache only
[13:04:47] <uGoMobi> we know
[13:04:57] <uGoMobi> so arschmitz writes a note aabout that
[13:05:26] <gnarf> i mean, just rename all these to .php then, change all the links.. then make the zip builder (which is already parsing all these files to do php's job) just know to rename them all to .html
[13:05:44] <gnarf> seems simple, and requires less server config hacking
[13:05:59] <gnarf> yeah?
[13:06:25] <uGoMobi> it means all our ~160 files
[13:07:12] <gnarf> anyway, can someone browse some tags on stage.view.jquerymobile.com and let me know if they look okay?
[13:07:33] <uGoMobi> gnarf: looks like stage isn't updated
[13:07:45] <uGoMobi> all content on master has been replaced today
[13:07:45] <gnarf> ?
[13:08:02] <uGoMobi> and I see the old homepage
[13:08:17] <uGoMobi> could be cache... hang on
[13:08:51] <gnarf> ##starting branch master
[13:08:51] <gnarf> HEAD is now at 740aa72 Demos: Re-org & cleanup of pages
[13:12:18] <uGoMobi> gnarf: that's an old commit
[13:12:23] <uGoMobi> head should be at 6c5fcc564f4ed81d1617fe7003272019a10d913a
[13:13:36] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: so we have to give all our files in the docs php extension
[13:13:54] <gnarf> bug
[13:13:55] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: and change that to html in the build for the zip
[13:14:32] <gnarf> this is one of those annoying things
[13:14:38] <gnarf> git fetch && git fetch -t
[13:14:51] <gnarf> there is no way to fetch branches and tags at the same time that i know up
[13:14:52] <gnarf> of
[13:15:54] <gnarf> http://stage.view.jquerymobile.com/master/
[13:17:24] <uGoMobi> yeah this looks good
[13:20:50] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/web-view-jquery-org/commit/7a8ff92d75a482847d3e4fc63dd02b472fffe6ab
[13:21:20] <uGoMobi> on /test/ "version dev" is replaced by last release like "version 1.3-RC.1"
[13:21:24] <uGoMobi> don't see that here
[13:21:33] <uGoMobi> on itself not really important
[13:22:00] <gnarf> i think thats because /test/ is actually being built
[13:22:11] <uGoMobi> ah of course
[13:22:24] <gnarf> are there commands i need to run to build after the checkout?
[13:22:29] <gnarf> and does it take long
[13:22:37] <gnarf> cuz this is a 5 minute cron and would need to run on every branch
[13:22:52] <uGoMobi> gnarf: I don't know
[13:23:16] <uGoMobi> I think johnbender or gseguin are the guys who know that
[13:27:23] <gnarf> i think im gonna work on rewriting this as a node project instead of python
[13:28:19] <gnarf> then i could make it a little smarter and only update things that change
[13:28:40] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: So we need to do some renaming tonight?
[13:29:34] <gnarf> I mean, I'm stuck with the problem forever because we can't fix the old tags, but like it'd be nice to not have the problem in the first place on your local runs :)
[13:29:56] <gnarf> the day you get someone like me trying to help and wondering why all the demos are broken because i'm not running apache :)
[13:31:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: I can do the renaming tomorrow morning european time
[13:31:24] <uGoMobi> like to get the header and search in shape first
[13:32:27] <uGoMobi> filling out call for papers for the dutch mobile conference first now (today last day)
[13:33:23] <uGoMobi> and we need to make the build replace the .php extension by .html for the zip... I hope gseguin or johnbender can do that tomorrow

[14:44:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: How do I access the demo via the navigation system?
[14:44:56] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I clicked on "Demo Showcase" from the front page, and then, into the search I typed "popup" and I got nothing.
[14:45:28] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: hmm that's not good
[14:46:21] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Maybe it's my server setup ...
[14:46:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you have apache?
[14:47:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[14:47:32] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: here it works http://stage.view.jquerymobile.com/master/docs/examples/
[14:48:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I don't think I have PHP turned on for .html files - that's the problem.
[14:48:11] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... only for .php files.
[14:48:25] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we have htaccess that set the handler
[14:48:31] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I see
[14:48:46] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: well we are going to switch to php files anyway
[14:48:50] <uGoMobi> :)
[14:49:00] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah, if I mv docs/examples/index.html docs/examples/index.php then it works.
[14:50:05] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: OK, so, since we're gonna go php anyway, I'm not going to bother fixing my Apache.
[14:50:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, no need
[14:52:35] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: do you know a way to change file names with a regex?
[14:53:35] <uGoMobi> except for a few files in the example folder we have to change it for all files
[14:53:55] <uGoMobi> would be nice if we don't have to do that manually
[14:55:47] <agcolom> uGoMobi: hey Jasper :-) I don't know how to change file names but I know how to change something inside all files in a folder... Not sure that can help though :-(
[14:56:50] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks, but that's not what I am looking for
[14:57:19] <uGoMobi> I can do find and replace for all content
[14:57:33] <agcolom> yes, that's what I thought... but I'm wondering whether the beginning can help you:
[14:57:34] <uGoMobi> but not for the file name itself, I think
[14:57:55] <agcolom> to do that I do:
[14:57:57] <agcolom> for i in `find . -type f -name \*.html`; do echo $i; perl -pi -w -e 's/1.2.0/1.3.0-beta.1/g;' $i; done
[14:58:15] <agcolom> that changes 1.2.0 with 1.3.0-beta.1
[14:58:36] <uGoMobi> wow
[14:58:41] <agcolom> but maybe the beginning to select the files could be the same? 
[14:59:00] <agcolom> (My partner is the king of unix so he did that for me ;-) )
[14:59:11] <uGoMobi> I jut type 1.2.0 in find and 1.3.0 in replace
[14:59:16] <agcolom> but he's in France! And I'm sure he knows how to do what you need!
[14:59:16] <uGoMobi> just*
[14:59:37] <uGoMobi> ah too bad he is not there
[14:59:51] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Waht do you need renamed? 
[15:00:05] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: all files in /docs/
[15:00:18] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: To what?
[15:00:22] <uGoMobi> the extension needs to be replaced
[15:00:28] <uGoMobi> from .html to .php
[15:00:40] <uGoMobi> of course not the _assets folder :)
[15:00:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I can do that. I'll give you the command line afterwards.
[15:01:07] <uGoMobi> and there are a few demos that should stay .html but i coud changes those back manually
[15:01:15] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: great!
[15:01:51] <uGoMobi> I never do find replace with command lines, just use Sublime Text or Dreamweaver
[15:02:22] <uGoMobi> so I can see what has been replaced
[15:02:58] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: That's a good strategy. I only do cat | sed when I'm absolutely sure ...
[15:03:06] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: find | grep '\.html$' | while read; do mv "$REPLY" "$(echo $REPLY | sed 's/\.html$/.php/')"; done
[15:03:27] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ran that inside docs/
[15:03:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Ooops .... should've done git mv not mv.
[15:04:04] <uGoMobi> ai
[15:05:49] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Nah, that's fine. Just move it all back :)
[15:06:30] <_|Nix|_> ?boom

[15:08:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It's kinda weird - in Chrome, the jQM logo comes before the navigation button and the search, but in IE8, the navigation and search buttons are correctly aligned along the two ends of the header.
[15:09:16] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: IE8 doesn't support media queries
[15:09:22] <uGoMobi> so you see the mobile layout
[15:09:54] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So, I guess the desktop layout doesn't work in Chrome ...
[15:09:58] <uGoMobi> header is work in progress BTW
[15:10:09] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Aaah, OK.

[15:26:14] <agcolom> toddmparker: ok, I'm ready for tomorrow. 
[15:27:49] <agcolom> I have made the changes and pushed on to stage. As soon as you tag 1.3.0, please let me know (maybe email or twitter). I will then need to run 2 commands to tag and push 
[15:28:48] <agcolom> So until then, the examples on stage will be broken (i.e. JQM is not loaded as 1.3.0 does not exist yet). 
[15:31:21] <agcolom> the live version is what I tagged this afternoon (so before moving to 1.3.0) and works fine

[16:21:25] <toddmparker> Sounds like trouble
[16:29:57] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Still here?
[16:30:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker: yes
[16:30:15] <toddmparker> Hi!
[16:30:19] <toddmparker> Long day
[16:30:20] <uGoMobi> fixing lot of broken links
[16:30:38] <toddmparker> So seems that we still need some infra help
[16:30:46] <uGoMobi> just thinking... if we change .php to .html in the build... we break internal links
[16:30:57] <uGoMobi> navmenus will be broken
[16:30:58] <uGoMobi> etc
[16:31:00] <toddmparker> PHP includes not working now right
[16:31:52] <toddmparker> Don't we bake include content in as part of the build so no need for PHP?
[16:32:13] <uGoMobi> yes
[16:32:37] <uGoMobi> the php is parsed
[16:33:24] <uGoMobi> the thing is that we want html files for the zip (build) but we need php files in the repo
[16:33:32] <uGoMobi> because of what gnarf said
[16:33:57] <toddmparker> Right
[16:34:20] <toddmparker> So the build script needs to convert all PHP links to HTML?
[16:34:34] <uGoMobi> yes
[16:35:01] <toddmparker> That seems doable 
[16:35:02] <uGoMobi> the file extensions and the links inside files
[16:35:22] <uGoMobi> and we need to be able to handle exceptions
[16:35:37] <toddmparker> Yeah, a few demos 
[16:36:23] <toddmparker> Lets see if we can help on that so we can focus on content/design
[16:39:54] <toddmparker> Just posted to BC to see if anyone is around
[16:40:51] <toddmparker> uGoMobi: Putting the kids to bed, be back on a few
[16:40:56] <uGoMobi> ok
[16:44:58] <toddmparker> Do things work locally so we can work?

[17:47:37] <uGoMobi> like the fixed toolbar examples etc
[17:47:58] <arschmitz> So what's the plan for build go all php for extensions and change in build?
[17:48:10] <toddmparker___> oh, i see. was confused by the old demos folder in there
[17:48:48] <toddmparker___> arschmitz: i think so - right uGoMobi?
[17:49:09] <uGoMobi> yes correct
[17:49:18] <arschmitz> Makes sense
[17:49:41] <arschmitz> Should not be top hard

[17:52:36] <toddmparker___> err

[19:13:43] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: no, nothing special... keep in mind that home is in root
[19:13:44] <arschmitz> whats the data source?
[19:14:22] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I changed your globalnav-panel.js... using listview instead of panel widget
[19:14:37] <uGoMobi> all menus are included now
[19:14:43] <arschmitz> i see
[19:15:24] <uGoMobi> so i just include all the menus in an  ul and then include that as list with filter
[19:16:26] <uGoMobi> sorry, all menu are included now --> all menus use an include now
[19:17:04] <arschmitz> cool
[19:17:09] <arschmitz> one sugestion
[19:17:26] <arschmitz> on the panel the dividers are barely noticable as a different color
[19:17:34] <arschmitz> they look like just another ithem
[19:17:37] <arschmitz> item
[19:17:52] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[19:18:13] <arschmitz> just a little tweak on the color so they stand out 
[19:18:22] <uGoMobi> yeah
[19:18:50] <uGoMobi> colors can be so different on different screens
[19:18:58] <arschmitz> yeah its hard

[20:02:25] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: right - that now needs to happen
[20:02:34] <gseguin> oh wait I do have access to the cdn
[20:02:34] <toddmparker___> so tomorrow is iffy.
[20:02:36] <gseguin> :D
[20:02:42] <toddmparker___> you do?
[20:02:43] <arschmitz> He was in the meeting that day just never got around to it
[20:02:44] <toddmparker___> cool.
[20:03:05] <arschmitz> gseguin: Awesome
[20:03:20] <toddmparker___> so the script to convert all the filenames from php to html and change links - was gnarf working on that?
[20:03:36] * gseguin reallizes that he just lost a chance to stay silent ;)
[20:03:44] <toddmparker___> heh
[20:04:41] <toddmparker___> gseguin: i guess we don't need to your help tonight - that right everyone?
[20:05:05] <gseguin> so /test is sorted out?
[20:05:26] <gseguin> toddmparker___: you have my number?
[20:05:45] <gseguin> I'll take my laptop with me tomorrow
[20:06:09] <gseguin> the thing is I don't have Bender's checklist for the release
[20:06:20] <gseguin> I would feel much more comfortable with it
[20:08:21] <gseguin> toddmparker, toddmparker___: ^

[20:08:41] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1323: FIXED in 14 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1323/
[20:08:52] <ryanneufeld> my ears are ringing
[20:08:59] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: no, we have to take care of that script
[20:09:02] <gseguin> YAY! Jasper!
[20:09:15] <toddmparker___> gseguin: there is a list on the wiki i think
[20:09:20] <gseguin> ha
[20:09:26] <gseguin> let me dig
[20:09:47] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: do we need help on that script or can you or arschmitz give it a look?
[20:10:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I don't know if arschmitz can do it
[20:10:40] <uGoMobi> but I don't think I can
[20:10:52] <arschmitz> on testswarm the one to change all the extensions?
[20:11:01] <toddmparker___> hi ryanneufeld - sorry to ping you, can you grant access to the cdn?
[20:11:09] <arschmitz> i ahh ignore first half of that about testswarm
[20:11:13] <ryanneufeld> cdn... I dunno
[20:11:20] <toddmparker___> gseguin: we might need help with that script if you can
[20:11:31] <gseguin> what script?
[20:11:32] <ryanneufeld> what is it that you need doing?
[20:11:44] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, the files that end up in the zip need .html extension
[20:11:51] <toddmparker___> we wanted to get more coverage with who can deploy a release
[20:11:52] <arschmitz> yeah im not super sure on changing all the links in the build could use some help on that one 
[20:11:59] <gseguin> is it a java script?
[20:12:01] <uGoMobi> and the links in files to those files need to be replaced too
[20:12:02] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker___: I'm not sure who has access to that
[20:12:10] <ryanneufeld> or even if I do
[20:12:14] <toddmparker___> ryanneufeld: cool. i'll ask around. thanks!
[20:12:15] <uGoMobi> gseguin: it's .sh I think
[20:12:23] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld i know gnarf said he could take care if it
[20:12:27] * gseguin barfs
[20:12:33] <toddmparker___> heh
[20:12:36] <gseguin> uGoMobi: which one ?
[20:12:41] <arschmitz> so we can bug him when hes around
[20:12:41] <ryanneufeld> cool
[20:12:46] <ryanneufeld> yeah,
[20:12:49] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I dunno actually
[20:12:54] <uGoMobi> config.sh?
[20:12:59] <gseguin> ha ha!
[20:13:19] <gseguin> so what does it do and what do you expect it to do next?
[20:13:22] <toddmparker___> gseguin: you're working on a new deploy with grunt?
[20:13:28] <gseguin> yes
[20:13:44] <gseguin> it's not there yet, it's not simple to keep simple
[20:13:44] <toddmparker___> did johnbender write the current deploy script? guessing yes.
[20:13:49] <gseguin> yes
[20:13:51] <toddmparker___> i bet
[20:13:51] <arschmitz> gseguin there needs to be a build step added where all the .php files are changed to .html
[20:13:58] <arschmitz> and all the links to those files as well
[20:14:13] <gseguin> ok
[20:14:17] <uGoMobi> or zip.sh
[20:14:18] <toddmparker___> ^ that
[20:14:29] <toddmparker___> i bet
[20:14:46] <toddmparker___> gseguin: does that seem like a tricky one?
[20:15:06] <arschmitz> the extensions seems easy enough its the links that seem harder
[20:15:17] <arschmitz> gseguin: any idea on that?
[20:15:30] <gseguin> in the docs? right?
[20:15:39] <uGoMobi> yes
[20:15:59] <gseguin> so wait, is there anything else happening to the php file?
[20:16:07] <gseguin> I mean besides being renamed?
[20:16:31] <arschmitz> they have includes
[20:16:36] <uGoMobi> right
[20:16:39] <arschmitz> but you already took care of those
[20:16:45] <uGoMobi> those need to be parsed first
[20:16:48] <gseguin> no no
[20:16:59] <gseguin> I took care of these in grunt-0.4
[20:17:01] <gseguin> not master
[20:18:31] <arschmitz> gseguin: sorry for some reason i thought you merged that last week. iv been a little here and there for the last week or so lol
[20:19:47] <gseguin> no worries I realize you've been through a lot
[20:20:01] <gseguin> yeah so before you just rename php to html 
[20:20:39] <gseguin> we need some other scripts that resolves the php first
[20:20:56] <toddmparker___> right
[20:21:56] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1324: UNSTABLE in 13 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1324/
[20:22:18] <gseguin> I can try to port some logic from grunt-0.4
[20:22:41] <uGoMobi> phantomMaster.toggle( "failure" ) ???
[20:22:44] <uGoMobi> pff
[20:24:19] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: I working on adding that close icon to the panel
[20:24:38] <uGoMobi> the width of the search needs some attention too
[20:24:45] <uGoMobi> but going to sleep few hours now
[20:24:58] <uGoMobi> will be around whole day tomorrow
[20:26:01] <uGoMobi> toddmparker___: if you run into things I need to look at just mail me or mention it here (will catch up)
[20:26:05] <uGoMobi> good night all
[20:28:45] <arschmitz> goodnight uGoMobi

[20:36:15] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: thanks. goodnight
[20:36:20] <toddmparker___> i just linked up the logos
[20:37:26] <gseguin> so which php files need to be resolved statically?
[20:37:46] <arschmitz> all of them
[20:38:07] <arschmitz> lol
[20:38:17] <gseguin> heh :)
[20:38:55] <gseguin> grr...
[20:39:39] * gseguin takes a look
[20:40:04] <gseguin> arschmitz: in demos or all in docs?
[20:40:48] <arschmitz> all docs
[20:41:01] <arschmitz> demos ~= demos now
[20:41:10] <arschmitz> demos ~= docs
[20:41:31] <arschmitz> old docs are gone docs folder is demos site now
[20:47:26] <gseguin> and why do we need to get rid of PHP for this release?
[20:48:05] <arschmitz> .php wont work in zip without a server
[20:48:21] <gseguin> but it's already the case, isn't it?
[20:48:43] <gseguin> I mean, that's not something new to 1.3?
[20:49:01] <arschmitz> docs never "relied" on php in same way before
[20:49:17] <arschmitz> there were never php includes before
[20:52:02] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[20:52:02] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master build #1325: FIXED in 14 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master/1325/
[20:54:00] <gseguin> bummer
[20:54:25] <arschmitz> yeah
[20:54:48] <arschmitz> there is an alternatve temp if you cant make it work
[20:55:27] <arschmitz> we can just say hay search and nav panel dont work in zip
[20:55:50] <arschmitz> hide them by default and only show them if php is avalible
[20:56:43] <arschmitz> however we will still need to rename everything for .php to .html or zip is totally useless with out server
[20:56:53] <gseguin> it seems like a risky change to me
[20:57:05] <gseguin> though I might just be missing the right tool
[20:57:44] <arschmitz> yeah wish i could help more iv been learnign to build and grunt a lot more good enough to fix and debug but still not realy there on adding features lol
[20:58:13] <arschmitz> so many typos lol
[20:58:25] <arschmitz> must be getting tired lol
[21:03:31] <gseguin> I wonder if that: https://github.com/vanetix/grunt-includes could be a good base to solve the problem
[21:03:38] <gseguin> it would need forked though
[21:07:55] <gseguin> ok I see a solution but it's not easy
[21:08:27] <gseguin> first all php includes should be on one line and all using a php tag
[21:08:49] <gseguin> second, when including a file that contains only html
[21:08:58] <gseguin> like nav-widgets.php
[21:09:09] <gseguin> rename the target file to .html
[21:09:44] <gseguin> this way we can do a 2 pass process that will source the included files
[21:10:00] <arschmitz> sounds about right
[21:10:05] <gseguin> however that is not something I can write tonight
[21:10:14] <arschmitz> yeah im sure
[21:10:18] <gseguin> nor tomorrow
[21:10:34] <arschmitz> ok so temp solution it is lol
[21:11:05] <arschmitz> ill get with toddmparker___ and uGoMobi on how to deal with it tomorrow
[21:11:28] <arschmitz> but we had anticipated this potentially already and talked about it
[21:11:29] <gseguin> sorry I couldn't come up with a miracle solution
[21:11:37] <arschmitz> no dont be
[21:11:49] <arschmitz> there was always a backup plan :)
[21:12:16] <toddmparker___> thanks for looking into this guys
[21:12:28] <arschmitz> gseguin what about just renaming all .php files in docs to .html
[21:12:31] <toddmparker___> this php extension thing was a curveball
[21:12:34] <arschmitz> how doable is that?
[21:12:46] <arschmitz> ignore the includes
[21:12:55] <gseguin> that would just  be  a find -exec
[21:13:04] <arschmitz> thats what i thought
[21:13:06] <gseguin> that shouldn't be difficult
[21:13:11] <gseguin> but what's the point?
[21:13:15] <arschmitz> thats much more important then the includes
[21:13:35] <arschmitz> the docs will function with out the includes they are just a nav panel
[21:14:07] <arschmitz> but nothing works if they have a php extension on the files
[21:14:08] <gseguin> I would release note that PHP is required to run the demos properly until we fix it
[21:14:58] <gseguin> because renaming the files seems like a hack to me
[21:15:32] <arschmitz> gseguin no its so that people can download the zip and view docs offline with out a server
[21:15:40] <arschmitz> like they have always been able to do
[21:16:01] <arschmitz> the includes are a whole seperate issue
[21:16:35] <arschmitz> toddmparker___ thoughts on how important it is to beable to use zip without server?
[21:17:03] <arschmitz> id be ok with requireing a server 
[21:17:48] <gseguin> we can open an issue immediatly for that and work on fixing it quickly after release
[21:18:24] <gseguin> That is totally a candidate for a patch release
[21:19:03] <arschmitz> gseguin: yeah im good with that just not sure about toddmparker___: i think he was the one before that wanted to make zip work without
[21:19:24] <arschmitz> when we added the php stuff in the first place 
[21:19:31] <gseguin> I'm with him
[21:19:53] <arschmitz> huh?
[21:20:03] <arschmitz> no you have confused me lol
[21:20:06] <arschmitz> now
[21:20:20] <gseguin> I mean I agree it would be best
[21:20:28] <gseguin> now given the time constraints
[21:20:36] <gseguin> and the state of things
[21:20:51] <gseguin> I think we could temporarily require a server
[21:21:00] <arschmitz> ok i gotcha
[21:21:10] <arschmitz> yeah i agree completely

[21:21:49] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 1496e9fba 15toddparker: Demos: Moved RWD into the intro folder, removed old table folder, fixed broken links
[21:22:06] <toddmparker___> lemme sleep on it
[21:22:26] <toddmparker___> but it's probably ok to require php until we can fix this up
[21:22:49] <toddmparker___> this php change was just requested a few hours ago
[21:23:02] <toddmparker___> and it makes the static zip requirement tricky
[21:23:09] <arschmitz> yup
[21:23:27] <arschmitz> and all but the file rename already works in the grunt 0.4 branch
[21:23:42] <arschmitz> so once that branch is good this will be much easier to fix
[21:24:13] <gseguin> I didn't realize that there was so much PHP
[21:24:27] <arschmitz> its new
[21:24:39] <arschmitz> never was before
[21:25:41] <gseguin> why don't we use requirejs and templates?
[21:25:54] <gseguin> that would solve your problem in no time
[21:26:23] <arschmitz> i dont have a good answer for that one lol
[21:26:42] <gseguin> :)
[21:26:53] <toddmparker___> we can discuss that option
[21:27:01] <gseguin> sounds good
[21:27:07] <toddmparker___> but for tomorrow, let's do something simple and low risk
[21:27:16] <gseguin> agreed
[21:27:27] <arschmitz> +!
[21:27:29] <arschmitz> 1
[21:27:32] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: need your eyes on the fixed toolbar page, it's buggy
[21:27:36] <toddmparker___> cool
[21:27:41] <toddmparker___> alright, off to bed
[21:27:44] <toddmparker___> thanks all
[21:27:48] <gseguin> alright, I'm out of here
[21:28:05] <gseguin> toddmparker: send me an email tomorrow if you need me 
[21:28:27] <gseguin> night, y'all
[21:28:41] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: jumping icon?
[21:30:09] <arschmitz> on page click
[21:30:36] <toddmparker___> yep
[21:30:50] <toddmparker___> and when you open the search and type...ugh
[21:30:52] <arschmitz> if so thats because there is a top:6px rule for btns in header
[21:31:07] <arschmitz> when the header is toggled
[21:31:19] <arschmitz> that overrides the media query in the docs css
[21:31:28] <arschmitz> need higher specificity in docs css
[21:31:30] <toddmparker___> so the absolute pos is the issue
[21:31:37] <toddmparker___> smart
[21:31:46] <arschmitz> yeah its just specificity
[21:31:47] <toddmparker___> mind looking at that?
[21:31:50] <toddmparker___> cool
[21:32:08] <arschmitz> yeah no problem
[21:32:26] <toddmparker___> when you close the left panel it does an odd shift. uGoMobi said it was the margin and can give it a look
[21:32:33] <toddmparker___> goodnight!
[21:32:44] <arschmitz> there will always be a 1px shift remember on toggle
