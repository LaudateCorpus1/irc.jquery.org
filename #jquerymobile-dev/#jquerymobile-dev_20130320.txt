[09:12:12] <gseguin> I'm going on a CLA quest
[09:15:41] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm around! What's up?
[09:16:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah ... I feel bad for having merged a few PRs ...
[09:16:08] <arschmitz> was looking at Changsuk's pr
[09:16:31] <arschmitz> i have one minor issue with the way its implemented right now but its totally fixabl
[09:16:43] <gseguin> Changsuk: have you signed a CLA ?
[09:17:25] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: it's ok, we just need to track them down
[09:18:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Well, I think the PR cannot be merged as is. I tried, and the demos front page wouldn't even load.
[09:18:06] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: He is modifying the ui widget factory directly and throwing in a bunch of $.mobile stuff
[09:18:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah.
[09:18:25] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That stuff needs to be moved out of there.
[09:18:26] <gseguin> I did not find Changsuk's name in the CLA list
[09:18:43] <gseguin> that means anyway we can't merge it
[09:19:07] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah it just needs a different home but cant modify that file thats a big no no lol 
[09:19:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's also Przemyslaw Ciezkowski
[09:19:14] <_|Nix|_> Sorry ...
[09:19:19] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ^^
[09:20:08] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I took his idea and combined it with the widget registry I made a while back, and I got things mostly working, although there are still some nav issues.
[09:20:21] <arschmitz> sweet
[09:20:38] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Hold on ... lemme push ...

[09:24:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ^
[09:25:04] <arschmitz> looking now
[09:28:11] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I used this measurement method (https://gist.github.com/anonymous/5206054) to get these results: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/lazy-widget-perf.pdf
[09:28:16] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: what?
[09:28:42] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Przemyslaw Ciezkowski may also not have signed the CLA.
[09:28:49] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I accepted about 3 PRs from him.
[09:29:02] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: what's his github handle?
[09:29:22] <_|Nix|_> @stforek
[09:29:27] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ^
[09:29:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... by loading demos/index.php
[09:30:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The performance difference would probably be even greater when loading an empty page.
[09:31:19] <arschmitz> yeah only thing i dont like is not using $.widget and having to use $.mobile._enhancer.addDefinition( "mobile.listview", { proto: {
[09:31:24] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Although, actually, come to think of it, I'm wrong.
[09:31:39] <arschmitz> if we are trying to merge more with UI this does not seem like the way to go
[09:31:44] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... because the time measured does not include page rendering. Merely the execution time for the library.
[09:32:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I know, but we have this auto-enhance thing ... 
[09:32:31] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was hoping to get some ideas on how we can make this less invasive.
[09:32:36] <arschmitz> yeah but right now that is handled outside the writing of the actual widget
[09:33:09] <arschmitz> so you could ( page considderations aside) just plop that in anywhere with out mobile at all
[09:33:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Plop what in where? Sorry - I lost the thread.
[09:33:33] <arschmitz> this would make it so any widget would have to be ported to work without mobile
[09:33:38] <arschmitz> a widget
[09:33:49] <arschmitz> in any random page with out mobile
[09:34:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Do you mean the Changsuk's solution can be plopped in anywhere?
[09:34:18] <arschmitz> no
[09:34:19] <_|Nix|_> s/the/that/
[09:34:36] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I was thinking about overwriting $.widget ...
[09:34:49] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: That would make it more transparent to widget implementations.
[09:34:59] <arschmitz> that might be better
[09:35:06] <arschmitz> ill try to look at it and think about it more
[09:35:29] <arschmitz> i just think we should try to keep the widgets as close to a normal non mobile widget as possible 
[09:35:30] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: There's another fairly deep implication: During mobileinit, none of the widget prototypes are available.
[09:35:46] <arschmitz> hmmm true
[09:35:54] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, you can't like, $.mobile.dialog.prototype.options.theme = "a";
[09:36:16] <arschmitz> and i mean we dont do that but people currently can and may
[09:36:27] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In my implem, you have to $.mobile.document.one( "dialogdefine", function() { $.mobile.dialog.prototype.options.theme = "a"; } );
[09:36:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[09:36:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: So, in a sense this is an API break.
[09:37:04] <arschmitz> this is a tricky one the performance gain would be nice but at what cost
[09:37:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Exactly.
[09:37:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: We need to decide whether the performance gain is worth it.
[09:37:49] <arschmitz> because widget syntax aside the prototype thing could be a real issue for some people
[09:37:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The problem with keeping the widgets plain is that the widget factory doesn't really provide any way of hooking into widget definition - only widget instantiation.
[09:38:01] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yep.
[09:38:26] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: They might have to move a lot of stuff out of mobileinit and into various <widget>define handlers.
[09:38:55] <arschmitz> which goes against everything we have been preaching about page events since the begining
[09:39:13] <arschmitz> thats a pretty major break
[09:39:19] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What do you mean? What does this have to do with page events?
[09:39:29] <arschmitz> not page events sorry
[09:39:40] <arschmitz> but setting defautls
[09:39:51] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ... set them all at once, eh?
[09:40:40] <arschmitz> yeah up till now its just been anything you want to override toss in mobile init and just drill into the prototypes
[09:41:50] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, another consequence I noticed in listview.filter ... if you create a widget inside another widget's _create() function, it's no longer enough to just AMD-depend on that other widget.
[09:42:12] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You need to $.mobile._enhancer.define( "mobile.otherwidget" ) before you can something.otherwidget();
[09:42:28] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: The widget factory could help here.
[09:42:47] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It could be modifed so that $.widget doesn't do the expensive stuff, but only registers the jQuery plugin.
[09:43:04] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then, when you call .widgetname() for the first time, it defines the proto.
[09:43:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: This wouldn't solve the configuration issue, but it would be pretty transparent.
[09:43:29] <arschmitz> yeah
[09:44:02] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then, we could have a global flag called lazy-protos or whatever, and people could choose to turn that on ...
[09:44:09] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... for the performance benefit.
[09:44:18] <arschmitz> that might be a better idea
[09:44:29] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... and they would have to be thoroughly aware of the implications.
[09:44:51] <arschmitz> still not crazy about overwriting anything in $.widget but if its an option maybe
[09:45:14] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You gotta ask yourself: Is the performance benefit worth it?
[09:45:39] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: ... or can we achieve greater gains by, for example, reducing our startup DOM manipulation ...
[09:45:53] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: done
[09:46:11] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: You got @stforek to sign the CLA?
[09:46:12] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ i think before we overwrite anything in $.widget we need to talk to scott_gonzalez
[09:46:21] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Definitely.
[09:46:32] <scott_gonzalez> What are you overwriting?
[09:46:51] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: We want to make it so $.widget does its work only when you call .widgetname() for the first time.
[09:47:03] <scott_gonzalez> That's crazy.
[09:47:10] <scott_gonzalez> And really really bad.
[09:47:12] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... but it's good for performance.
[09:47:19] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I sent him a message
[09:47:23] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ill let you explain im not clear and skeptical to begin lol
[09:47:26] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Great!
[09:47:46] <scott_gonzalez> You're having performance issues just defining your widgets?
[09:47:48] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: The bottom line is this: Calling $.widget during library startup increases startup time.
[09:48:40] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: We dunno if the performance benefit from defining widgets in a lazy fashion is worth the complexity.
[09:48:40] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, executing code always takes time.
[09:48:54] <scott_gonzalez> That's easy to find out.
[09:49:41] <scott_gonzalez> Though I don't understand how this helps mobile at all.
[09:49:42] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: In https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/5784, the author basically took the IIFE containing a module that defines a widget and assigned it to a variable, and delayed execution until the first instance of the widget needed to be created.
[09:49:46] <scott_gonzalez> Don't you create widgets immediately?
[09:50:19] <scott_gonzalez> This will most certainly break existing code.
[09:50:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yes, but if your front page contains three <p>s and an <a>, why would you define the slider, and the listview, and the popup, etc.
[09:50:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's for sure.
[09:50:58] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: You should maybe define them in an idle loop after having loaded the page.
[09:51:21] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... and displayed the page.
[09:51:41] <scott_gonzalez> If you front pagin doesn't use widgets, don't load the widgets.
[09:53:32] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's a good point. Perhaps creating multiple scripts such that each contains different parts of the library and loading them as necessary is the way to go.
[09:53:56] <scott_gonzalez> I asked the guy to prove that this is useful.
[09:54:12] <scott_gonzalez> I'd say there's about a 0.0001% chance of us agreeing to add this.
[09:54:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Here's some proof: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/lazy-widget-perf.pdf
[09:55:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I arrived at those numbers by recording the time before the first line of jQM and alerting the diff after the last line of jQM.
[09:55:41] <scott_gonzalez> So worst case scenario we're talking 30ms?
[09:56:05] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: What is the worst case scenario?
[09:56:17] <scott_gonzalez> Safari/iOS 6.0.1
[09:56:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Looks like.
[09:56:53] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: That's not the implem from the PR, however, it has the same idea.
[09:57:31] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I collect all the protos that would have been passed to $.widget into and array, and then I call $.widget repeatedly when I'm sure I need an instance of the widget.
[09:57:31] <scott_gonzalez> This graph is just parse/exec time with no widgets being initialized, right?
[09:57:38] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Right.
[09:58:06] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: So it doesn't matter what's on the page.
[09:58:11] <scott_gonzalez> Did you record the time with initialization as well?
[09:58:18] <scott_gonzalez> To see how that changed?
[09:58:21] <scott_gonzalez> Since it's probably slower now.
[09:58:29] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Oh, I see.
[09:58:39] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah, it probably is.
[09:59:13] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... especially if your first page is a Christmas tree of widget.
[09:59:16] <_|Nix|_> s.
[09:59:57] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I can do another run recording that.
[10:00:09] <scott_gonzalez> ok
[10:00:17] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: However, that's highly dependent on the page content.
[10:00:35] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: I mean, like I said, it'd make the biggest difference for a page containing three <p>s and an <a>.
[10:01:33] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: But, I guess there would be an improvement for all pages except those that instantiate every single widget in the library.
[10:01:44] <scott_gonzalez> Right, but that difference is only going to be 30ms on the slowest browser you tested.
[10:02:28] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah ... not much, eh?
[10:03:01] <scott_gonzalez> nope
[10:03:10] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Going the AMD way might be the way to go ...
[10:13:06] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: you're going to upset scott_gonzalez dropping the A-bomb like that ;)
[10:14:34] <scott_gonzalez> haha
[10:15:50] <_|Nix|_> Why is that a bomb? It seems like the only way to go.
[10:16:09] <_|Nix|_> Not only that, but devs are going to have to load scripts via AJAX ...
[10:16:36] <_|Nix|_> ... unless they wanna turn off AJAX for links that go between pages that have different compilations of jQM.
[10:16:37] <gseguin> I was kidding, scott_gonzalez is not a big fan of AMD
[10:18:56] <_|Nix|_> I wonder if $.getScript( "http://domain/path/to/widgets/needed/for/some/page.js" ).done( function() { $.mobile.oneofthosewidgets.prototype.options.theme = "a"; } ); would work ...
[10:19:30] <scott_gonzalez> It should.
[10:20:14] <scott_gonzalez> It's pretty similar to what I do here: view-source:http://scottsplayground.com/temp/jquery_versions/
[10:20:33] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: ... then the only remaining question is what happens if some parts of the library are already loaded. Like, if two different custom compilations contain a common module.
[10:20:51] <scott_gonzalez> You need to build your stuff properly.
[10:21:06] <_|Nix|_> scott_gonzalez: Yeah ... I think so.
[10:21:19] <scott_gonzalez> Oh, on a related note, UI no longer prevents duplicate loading.
[10:21:24] <scott_gonzalez> It now happily overwrites itself.
[10:24:51] <_|Nix|_> OK ... how do I get markdown to not interpret https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1 as issue number one?
[10:25:01] <_|Nix|_> Argh! Even my auto-replace is fooled!
[10:25:08] <_|Nix|_> I meant # 1
[10:25:41] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I fooled it like I fooled my auto-replace :)

[13:41:21] <agcolom> Good evening :-) anyone around?
[13:43:02] <agcolom> uGoMobi: gseguin johnbender Hi, I just noticed that at the bottom of the widget pages of the demo site, the version is 'dev' (see for example http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.0/docs/widgets/accordions/)
[13:46:19] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi! yeah, has to do with moving stuff to .view
[13:46:29] <uGoMobi> gnarf asked about that
[13:46:40] <agcolom> oh ok
[13:46:43] <uGoMobi> we hardcoded the version on the homepage
[13:46:49] <uGoMobi> just before the release
[13:46:57] <agcolom> ok
[13:47:03] <uGoMobi> think we forgot about the footer :(
[13:50:54] <gseguin> agcolom: oh bummer
[13:51:04] <agcolom> hey :-)
[13:51:25] <agcolom> we need a checklist :-)
[14:02:39] <gseguin> this should be automated though
[14:03:34] <agcolom> if that was possible, it would be great!
[14:06:26] <gseguin> it is
[14:12:17] <uGoMobi> agcolom: I looked at the collapsible events
[14:13:05] <agcolom> uGoMobi: oh yes?
[14:13:05] <uGoMobi> we have to change the docs:
[14:13:08] <uGoMobi> collapsibleexpand --> expand
[14:13:08] <agcolom> ok
[14:13:23] <uGoMobi> collapsiblecollapse--> collapse
[14:13:40] <agcolom> right... I need to check whether this is possible with the current XSLT...
[14:13:41] <uGoMobi> collapsiblecreate is correct (no need to change)
[14:13:51] <uGoMobi> XSLT?
[14:14:06] <agcolom> yes, the XML is transformed using XSLT ;-)
[14:14:09] <uGoMobi> what's that?
[14:14:13] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[14:14:37] <agcolom> Thanks a lot for checking!
[14:14:45] <uGoMobi> np

[14:50:11] <agcolom> not sure... that was a long time ago...
[14:50:32] <agcolom> nomally when there's a change I just do npm install... and it all works out... 
[14:50:44] <johnbender> agcolom: http://nodejs.org/
[14:51:05] <agcolom> click install?
[14:51:30] <johnbender> yah
[14:51:32] <gseguin> agcolom: sometimes you need to `rm -rf node_modules`
[14:51:36] <johnbender> let's see what happens
[14:51:42] <johnbender> gseguin: she needs an updated version of node
[14:51:50] <gseguin> oh that
[14:52:10] <gseguin> nave is your friend
[14:52:20] <johnbender> o.o
[14:52:33] <gseguin> just `npm install nave`
[14:52:41] <johnbender> gseguin: don't tell me
[14:52:41] <gseguin> then `nave usemain 0.8.22`
[14:53:01] <gseguin> or nvm whatever floats your boat
[14:53:44] <agcolom> right... install successfull
[14:53:57] <agcolom> just redid npm install 
[14:54:03] <agcolom> all ok wexcept 3 warnings...
[14:54:21] <agcolom> just complaining about no readme files, so should be ok!!!!
[14:54:26] <agcolom> Thank you :-)
[14:54:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I was thinking that we can achieve lazy widget loading completely transparently if we employ getters and setters.
[14:54:45] <agcolom> oh no.... not ok...
[14:54:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I'm trying to run this by scott_gonzalez, but he's not around.
[14:55:35] <johnbender> agcolom: win
[14:55:40] <agcolom> Anne-Gaelle-Coloms-MacBook-Pro:api.jquerymobile.com anne-gaellecolom$ grunt deploy
[14:55:40] <agcolom> path.existsSync is now called `fs.existsSync`.

[14:55:40] <agcolom> >> Error: Cannot find module 'cheerio'
[14:55:48] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Basically, we define a getter/setter for $.mobile.<widgetname>, $.fn.<widgetname> and $.expr[":"][<widgetname>]
[14:55:56] <agcolom> should I do npm install again?
[14:56:04] <johnbender> agcolom: yes
[14:56:18] <agcolom> npm WARN package.json connect@1.8.7 No README.md file found!

[14:56:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Then, if anyone runs a selector for the widget, or if anyone attempts to instantiate the widget, or if anyone attempts to access the proto, we can define the widget there and then.
[14:56:28] <gseguin> agcolom: that's ok
[14:56:52] <agcolom> but when I try grunt deploy, I get errors and it aborts... 
[14:57:08] <gseguin> agcolom: what's the error when you do grunt deploy?
[14:57:14] <agcolom> path.existsSync is now called `fs.existsSync`.

[14:57:38] <gseguin> do rm -rf node_modules
[14:57:43] <gseguin> npm install
[14:58:45] <agcolom> I see, so we've cleared all modules and we get them from scratch again....
[14:59:02] <agcolom> yes!!!!!
[14:59:11] <agcolom> Done, without errors.
[14:59:21] <agcolom> Thank you so much johnbender & gseguin !!!
[14:59:34] <gseguin> you're welcome
[14:59:36] <johnbender> great
[14:59:38] <johnbender> :)
[14:59:57] <agcolom> one tiny last thing...
[15:00:01] <agcolom> (sorry)
[15:00:29] <agcolom> If I make a change to my local file, and run grunt deploy (to deploy to local) I should see the change right?
[15:00:40] <agcolom> (without having to commit )
[15:00:55] <gseguin> agcolom: I'm assuming so
[15:00:55] <johnbender> agcolom: not sure about your setup
[15:01:14] <agcolom> I seem to remember that that was the case... 
[15:01:43] <agcolom> but I make a change to entries/collapsible.xml, then run grunt deploy, and it's not showing...
[15:01:52] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: so the $.fn for the widget is just a proxy
[15:02:08] <agcolom> I had to restart my computer this evening. could this have affected something?
[15:02:15] <agcolom> (I did restart mamp)
[15:02:43] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: which defines the widget the first time and then just works as normal subsequently
[15:03:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: neat idea for sure, still interested in some perf #s :)
[15:03:40] <agcolom> sorry It is showing! 
[15:03:56] <agcolom> so I'm all ok! 
[15:04:13] <agcolom> thanks again johnbender and gseguin! you guys totally rock! 
[15:04:36] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Some initial numbers: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/lazy-widget-perf.pdf
[15:04:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-getters-and-setters/
[15:05:34] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: what does the page look like in those cases?
[15:06:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The page loads correctly.
[15:06:52] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I tried it with the front page for the demos.
[15:06:56] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right I'm just curious how complex it is
[15:06:59] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The page rendering time is not included.
[15:07:06] <johnbender> just the parse time?
[15:07:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yes. I added a new Date() before the first line of jQM and an alert with the diff after the last line of jQM.
[15:07:32] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I think that's my point, the metric we care about is load to using the page
[15:07:37] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yar
[15:07:48] <johnbender> and then what percentage of that is the parsing
[15:08:00] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool
[15:08:05] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: thanks for looking into that
[15:08:09] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I know, but parsing is part of that, and it's the part that doesn't change, no matter what the page complexity.
[15:08:29] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: right but we have to guage the value of spending time on working this in and the bugs it'll introduce vs the value
[15:08:43] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The performance benefit is more than can be ignored, IMO, but the complexity right now is not worth it (also IMO).
[15:09:03] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: waiting on that first bit still I guess
[15:09:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: If doing it via getters/setters is a totally transparent, it might be worth putting it in.
[15:09:44] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: still a complexity vs value argument
[15:09:51] <johnbender> and we don't have the second piece
[15:09:53] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: But I agree, dom manip is probably the elephant in the living room.
[15:10:00] <johnbender> yes
[15:10:20] <johnbender> I'd wager we could avoid quite a few reflows in there somewhere
[15:10:23] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I've been chipping away at the instantiation time for various widgets.
[15:10:30] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: No doubt.
[15:10:51] <agcolom> johnbender gseguin I have spotted a few typos in the comments of the rangeslider javascript file. I'd like to change those at some point... When is a good time to do that (to avoid having to cherry-pick, etc.) (If I just did it in the github editor, it'd be really easy). 
[15:10:52] <toddmparker> I think that if we can cut down on all the markup enhancements, that will be the biggest win
[15:11:07] <toddmparker> agcolom: go for it
[15:11:28] <gseguin> agcolom: what toddmparker said
[15:11:45] <agcolom> ok... is it ok in the github editor?
[15:12:15] <toddmparker> think so, yeah
[15:12:29] <toddmparker> you can use the editor on master and cherry pick over to 1.3-stable
[15:13:25] <agcolom> ok, I'll need gseguin's brain then to make sure I remember how to do this ;-)
[15:13:42] <agcolom> going to make the changes in the next few mins then...

[15:33:38] <agcolom> I like that comment! 
[15:34:07] <agcolom> gseguin: ping
[15:39:14] <agcolom> I think I might I missed gseguin... johnbender are you around?
[15:43:17] <agcolom> never mind... looks like I might have to wait the morning to cherry-pick. 
[15:43:54] <agcolom> (I remember I was typing a series of about 6 to 8 commands but I've lost my notes for that...
[15:44:10] <agcolom> it was something like git fetch upstream
[15:44:28] <agcolom> sorry first was git checkout master
[15:44:34] <agcolom> git fetch upstream
[15:45:14] <agcolom> git rebase upstream/master (not sure)
[15:45:38] <agcolom> git checkout 1.3-stable
[15:46:11] <agcolom> git rebase upstream/1.3-stable
[15:48:53] <agcolom> git cherry-pick 2a44f5ceb1 
[15:49:44] <agcolom> git push upstream 1.3-stable
[15:49:52] <agcolom> is that correct ? ^^
[15:50:15] <agcolom> will check in the morning... goodnight everyone ! 
[15:58:02] <gseguin> what's up agcolom 
[15:58:31] <gseguin> oh for cherry-picking?
[15:58:45] <gseguin> agcolom: got to the branch you want to cherry-pick to
[15:59:09] <gseguin> then `git log --oneline origin/master`
[15:59:26] <gseguin> copy the hash of the commit you want to cherry pick
[15:59:46] <gseguin> then `git cherry-pick -x <commit-hash>`
[16:02:38] <gseguin> agcolom: you still there?
[16:25:30] <gseguin> join #phantomjs
[16:25:53] * gseguin missed typing the forward slash, obviously
[17:42:57] <gnarf> agcolom: just checkout the branch you want the commit in (and pull obviously, but your repo is likely current) then `git cherry-pick -x sha`   the -x just adds a "cherry picked from ...." line to the commit
