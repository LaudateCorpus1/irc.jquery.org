[07:49:14] <toddparker> hey all - I'm back!
[07:49:23] <toddparker> what did I mess? :)
[07:49:29] <toddparker> miss
[07:49:49] <toddparker> this seem like a good idea for XSS prevention: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1789
[08:27:27] <gseguin> good morning all
[08:32:46] <gseguin> kinblas: Can you land this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1784
[08:32:53] <gseguin> it's a whitespace change
[10:22:35] <StevenBlack> kinblas: Hello!  Can you please pull https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/1761, or close it.  I'm tired of waiting.  Thanks.
[13:17:08] <gseguin> can someone close https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1617?
[14:23:29] <toddparker> gseguin - I closed #1617 for you. you should be able to open and close issues yourself. i see others doing it unless it's just committers and the issue creator?
[14:24:14] <toddparker> stevenblack - I think ScottJehl is supposed to review #1761 because Kin needed a second opinion...Scott is out today but I can nudge him about it
[14:24:15] <gseguin> toddparker: thanks, I didn't know
[14:24:40] <toddparker> gesguin - let me know if you see a button to close issues...
[14:24:53] * gseguin checking gihub
[14:25:39] <toddparker> so we need to start thinking about what open issues are critical enough to be blockers for beta 1 so we can start focsing on nailing those down this week
[14:25:43] <gseguin> toddparker: I don't see one
[14:25:53] <toddparker> gseguin - bummer
[14:26:10] <toddparker> i'm happy to do it for you, not sure how permissions are managed on the git repo
[14:26:12] <gseguin> can you assign issues to non-commiter?
[14:26:18] <toddparker> i can ask scott or john r
[14:26:25] <gseguin> besides the tag thing?
[14:26:26] <toddparker> don't think so
[14:26:31] <toddparker> that's why i was using tags
[14:26:58] <gseguin> yeah I guess if you're not owner or resolver you can't close
[14:28:34] <toddparker> bummer
[14:44:17] <StevenBlack> toddparker: You there?
[14:54:14] <StevenBlack> kinblas, you there?
[16:18:02] <StevenBlack> ping.
[16:25:17] <gseguin> pong
[16:26:55] <StevenBlack> Salut Ghislain.  Peut-tu, svp, relier le message à todd ou kin de supprimer le tag 'stevenblack' sur les quatre issues qui me sont liés?  J'en ai plein mon casque, c'est fini.
[16:27:17] <StevenBlack> Merci!
[16:27:51] <gseguin> "c'est fini"? meaning?
[16:28:07] <gseguin> done with jQM?
[16:28:14] <StevenBlack> Pardon, trois.  #1762, #1554 et #1555
[16:28:27] <StevenBlack> Je perds mon temps ici.
[16:28:38] <gseguin> Je transmettrai
[16:28:49] <StevenBlack> Merci, et bon vent!
[16:29:06] <gseguin> de rien, j'espere n'y etre pour rien
