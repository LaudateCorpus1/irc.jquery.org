[07:27:17] <Wilto> Morning.
[07:49:17] <danheberden> Morning Wilto - sry i was away
[07:49:38] <danheberden> you should just txt me when you need me for realzies
[07:50:33] <Wilto> LEMME GET THEM DIGITS, GURL
[07:57:27] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[07:57:28] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #1,134: FIXED in 25 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/1134/
[07:59:18] <Wilto> danheberden: But, nothing too pressing this time.
[07:59:36] <Wilto> danheberden: Could you start a repo under jQuery for the jQM Download Builder?
[08:02:34] <danheberden> Wilto and make the list of repos EVEN LONGER?
[08:03:46] <danheberden> I had asked ages ago if the UI builder and and jQM builder would be the same - did that ever get traction or affirmation?
[08:04:00] <Wilto> I’ll tell you when we have enough!
[08:05:54] <Wilto> danheberden: But yeah, this is kind of a stop-gap thing for now, if that’s cool.
[08:06:11] <Wilto> Short-term download builder for jQM. Longer term, we’ll be syncing up with UI’s.
[08:06:21] <danheberden> no, it isn't - i want production quality version 10 software NOW GODDAMNIT
[08:06:29] <Wilto> DO NOT TEST ME TODAY DAN
[08:06:57] <danheberden> Y UR TEST SUITE BROKEN BROK?
[08:07:02] <danheberden> *bro
[08:07:06] <Wilto> UR FACE IS BROK
[08:07:11] <danheberden> BROK BROK
[08:07:25] <danheberden> http://fearthegaychicken.org/
[08:07:28] <Wilto> That’s right, jQM. I’ve lost my mind, this morning.
[08:08:48] <Wilto> But yeah, that would be sweet. If we’re getting a little long-in-the-repos, we could chuck it under FG too—no big.
[08:09:34] <danheberden> nah, tis cool
[08:09:46] <danheberden> just making sure i shouldn't name it jQuery-mobile-and-someday-ui-builder
[08:10:17] <johnbender> danheberden: they're going to be different mostly because we didn't hear about it until long after we were finished implementing amd and the way we do modules doesn't fit super well as "plugins"
[08:10:34] <danheberden> A FITTING EXCUSE JOHN
[08:10:39] <danheberden> aiight that sounds reasonable
[08:10:53] <danheberden> same peeps on this re: access?
[08:11:11] <johnbender> danheberden: though we talked with the UI folks and we think we can generate the json files necessary to use the plugins site so we'll probably be on both :D
[08:13:13] <danheberden> sweetness
[08:15:36] <Wilto> danheberden: Yeah, all the same bros and/or ladybros.
[08:15:38] <johnbender> danheberden: yes, amd as a deps resolution framework is pretty awesome :D
[08:16:20] <danheberden> johnbender i keep hearing this - but i don't see how a processor manufacturer is helping with dependencies
[08:19:26] <Wilto> I think it’s cool.
[08:19:46] <Wilto> I think PapayaWhip is cool too.
[08:19:55] <Wilto> i’m pretty tired you guys

[09:26:00] <johnbender> that seems to be going around :/

[10:22:53] <toddparker> hey johnbender
[10:23:05] <toddparker> when did we rig up jQM tweets here? cool.
[10:23:25] <toddparker> so i'm working with scott on those last few bugs in that BC thread
[10:23:47] <toddparker> think the fixed toolbar bugs Wilto was working on are square and documented
[10:23:55] <toddparker> finally getting caught up
[10:24:03] <toddparker> been swamped the last 2 weeks + vacation
[10:43:48] <Wilto> Square as they’re gonna be.
[10:47:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl force-pushed simultaneous-trans-experiment from 28ac10a to c51b094: http://git.io/qlCZJg
[10:47:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/simultaneous-trans-experiment] a test pass at what would be involved in simultaneous transitions for slide and others - scottjehl
[10:47:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/simultaneous-trans-experiment] default to slide, unlink the non-simul slide transitions - scottjehl
[10:47:19] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/simultaneous-trans-experiment] maybe better timing - scottjehl
[10:58:06] <Wilto> I wish we could force push more often. So much Star-Wars-ier.
[11:37:02] <johnbender> toddparker: I didn't add the socialhappy bot
[11:37:08] <johnbender> toddparker: maybe jzaefferer ?
[11:37:10] <johnbender> not sure
[11:37:28] <johnbender> toddparker: I've been working with that "double transition" bug
[11:37:45] <johnbender> and its very clearly different when there isn't a header
[11:37:50] <johnbender> seems like a css interaction
[11:38:03] <johnbender> no amount of commenting out and delays were able to change things in the js :(
[11:38:30] <johnbender> I even tried delaying the promise resolution for a second to see if that made a difference
[11:38:53] <johnbender> I wonder if shrinking the content will make a difference
[11:42:37] <johnbender> toddparker: one thing I didn't try was removing the large amount of content in the sample app to see if this is an acceleration issue
[11:49:12] <johnbender> ok
[11:49:23] <johnbender> removing the content did seem to make a difference but someone else should verify it
[12:24:37] <johnbender> toddparker: what are the other codiqa-alikes?
[12:24:55] <johnbender> I'm adding in some slides into my intro proso on third party stuff

[13:52:41] <johnbender> hmm
[13:52:44] <johnbender> it's not in the docs either
