[03:14:24] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Readme: Added a line about checking existing tickets before opening a new one. Added "JQM version" to the required information because, although we normally test with latest, it could regard a bug in a RC version. - Jasper de Groot

[06:55:06] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Anne, you here?
[07:02:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Is it ok if I change the left nav menu for listviews in a way that... "Inset styled lists" comes between "Content formatting" and "Search filter bar"? The current order isn't logical if you ask me.
[07:17:03] <agcolom> Hi!
[07:17:13] <agcolom> Let me check...
[07:17:19] <agcolom> uGoMobi ^
[07:19:03] <uGoMobi> agcolom: hi Anne
[07:19:33] <agcolom> Hi Jasper :-)
[07:20:38] <agcolom> yes, I agree! no need to cherry-pick. If you want to concentrate on the dev side of things and your work I'm happy to make the change... up to you... just let me know...
[07:22:06] <agcolom> I'm desperate with the amount of rain we are getting here!!! It's not stopping and no sign of improvement in the next 5 days :-(
[07:23:25] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes, just for master. I can take of it, only few minutes work, thanks
[07:23:41] <agcolom> ok, great :-) thx :-)
[07:23:57] <uGoMobi> rain, rain and more rain :(
[07:24:07] <uGoMobi> no sunshine here either
[07:25:03] <agcolom> it is terrible! Well, I think toddmparker_ has asked for some rubbish weather over northern Europe so we get more work done ;-)
[07:25:47] <uGoMobi> looks like I see sunshine above Wimbledon though
[07:27:45] <MauriceG> Hi Anne, hi uGoMobi :-)
[07:27:58] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[07:28:04] <agcolom> I'm South East London. Wimbledon is South West London. There is no sunshine in sight here right now! but with this weather, you never know... It was sunny here 10mins ago, just enough to get the floors dry and ready for more rain!
[07:28:12] <agcolom> Hi Maurice :-)
[07:29:21] <agcolom> Guys, when you do some mobile web dev, do you follow any good HCI guidelines? (and if you do, which ones?)
[07:30:59] <MauriceG> this time I just try to make it most user friendly...
[07:34:30] <agcolom> ok, thx :-)
[07:36:12] <MauriceG> Anne, don't you think jQuery Mobile is a guideline itself?
[07:37:24] <MauriceG> user friendly inputs, default color theme with max contrast. aria and all this things.
[07:37:59] <agcolom> I totally agree!
[07:38:44] <agcolom> ok... time for a break ;-) sunshine for maybe only 5 mins so need to make the most of it !
[07:39:24] <MauriceG> may still take a umbrella with you
[07:39:35] <MauriceG> an*
[07:40:23] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: what do you think about a auto-order listview option? The auto-divider assumes that listitems always ordered.  nonsense?
[07:40:31] <MauriceG> an* ...

[07:44:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs: changed the order of the listview navmenu. - Jasper de Groot
[07:45:30] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: could be nice, have to see what is the impact on performance
[07:46:44] <uGoMobi> I don't know what the function looks like right now
[07:47:29] <MauriceG> yes, but if there is a performance impact, it just occurs if it is used
[07:48:19] <uGoMobi> sorry, not sure I understand what you mean... "it just occurs if it is used"?
[07:48:20] <MauriceG> on large lists with slow devices I'm sure it will
[07:49:29] <MauriceG> if there is an option auto-order on a listview, the performance impact just occurs, if this option is used.
[07:50:39] <MauriceG> Do you have some experience with ordering with jQuery?
[07:51:16] <uGoMobi> no not really
[07:51:52] <MauriceG> put the list items in an array, order the array and write it back to the listview ...
[07:53:22] <MauriceG> this android 2... devices may give off clouds of smoke ...
[07:53:57] <uGoMobi> ok so it will be an additional option if you use auto-divider?
[07:54:13] <uGoMobi> something you can turn on/off
[07:55:12] <MauriceG> no, I think it should just be an option for all listviews  - and it's just an idea
[07:56:47] <uGoMobi> I understand. I would prefer to take care of it server side, but still might be a nice option... ask toddmparker_

[07:57:34] <socialhapy> â˜… Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (2w, 2d ago): New listview option icon - change or disable icons on listviews
[07:57:47] <MauriceG> yes.
[07:57:58] <uGoMobi> listview.jqmData ( "icon" ) and listview.options.icon are not the same... different objects
[07:58:40] <uGoMobi> so, as far as I know, the widget factory doesn't check for the data-attribute
[07:59:03] <uGoMobi> still curious how that worked in your code :)
[08:00:03] <uGoMobi> if you just add option "icon" to the listview widget, setting data-icon="xxx" on the ul with data-role="listview" would still not work
[08:04:06] <MauriceG> the data-yyy option is set by the widget-factory if it is set on the widget
[08:04:31] <MauriceG> xxx*
[08:05:19] <MauriceG> if ( value !== undefined ) {
[08:05:35] <MauriceG> options[ option ] = value; }

[08:06:24] <MauriceG> sorry, time for dinner (just on sunday...)
[08:07:30] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ok, enjoy your dinner
[13:56:22] <agcolom> wishing a HAPPY BIRTHDAY to johnbender!!!!!
[14:05:58] <johnbender> agcolom: thanks :D
[14:06:06] <johnbender> the whole family is sick so I get to be lazy :D
[15:10:54] <MauriceG> Hi johnbender: Happy Birthday!! I wish you a nice day! Keep healthy!
