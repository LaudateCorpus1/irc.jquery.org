[07:35:58] <toddparker> triage folks - keep your eyes peeled for issues that are more JS focused (i.e. a logic bug) or BB focused for JasonDScott to look at. He's got some time to help us fix some bugs
[07:36:19] <toddparker> obviously, he doesn't have iOS and Android devices since he works at RIM
[07:42:40] <Wilto> I’ve actually gone Amish, so I don’t really have any phones at all anymore.
[07:43:02] <Wilto> So y’know, go ahead and assign any phone-specific issues to other folks.

[10:04:14] <adammessinger> Hi all. Todd Parker recommended I come here to discuss a work-around for issue #4050.
[10:09:50] <adammessinger> Code for my work-around is here: http://pastebin.com/2ypVYiY4
[10:11:01] <uGoMobi> hi adammessinger! welcome
[10:12:38] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4050
[10:12:39] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4050 on jquery-mobile (adammessinger; 1m, 1w ago): First jQM page visited w/ non-ajax request remains cached in DOM
[10:13:22] <uGoMobi> scottjehl: Scott are you here?
[10:13:36] <adammessinger> Thanks, uGoMobi. I'm wondering how important it is for my work-around to keep the first-visited page in the DOM once it's been reloaded on a subsequent visit.
[10:14:19] <adammessinger> I've looked through the framework's navigation code, but I'm still a bit fuzzy on why the page is retained.
[10:14:24] <uGoMobi> adammessinger: I am reading the thread
[10:16:45] <uGoMobi> adammessinger: to be honest I can't think of a reason to keep first-loaded page in DOM, but guys like Scott know more about that
[10:17:40] <uGoMobi> adammessinger: would be nice if this would become option. i.e. only keep initial page in DOM if dom-cache is set to true
[10:19:02] <adammessinger> uGoMobi: That's what my work-around shoots for. If it is important to keep initial page in DOM, it should be pretty easy to modify it so that happens while still re-requesting the initial page on subsequent visits.
[10:30:15] <_|Nix|_> Oh no - navigation bug: 1. In a fresh tab, go to http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html#&ui-state=dialog 2. Click "Anatomy of a page" 3. Click "Back"
[10:30:40] <_|Nix|_> The URL in the location bar will be updated, but the page content will not.
[10:35:08] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this sounds familiar
[10:35:45] <_|Nix|_> Oh?
[10:35:53] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: BTW: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4423
[10:35:53] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4423 on jquery-mobile (gabrielschulhof; 21.325s ago): Navigation: When the initial page has a dialogHashKey, navigation breaks after link-click followed by "Back"
[10:36:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: It breaks popups as well, but for different reasons.
[10:36:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, thats probably. i remember it was an issue you opened
[10:36:45] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok
[10:36:46] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I just opened it less than a minute ago ...
[10:37:01] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: So if you know of an older issue, mark mine a duplicate of that.
[10:37:11] <_|Nix|_> I mean, close it as a dupe.
[10:42:23] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: this is the issue i meant https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4097
[10:42:24] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4097 on jquery-mobile (gabrielschulhof; 1m, 4d ago): First page replaces dialog's parent page in Chrome
[10:52:08] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, no ... that's another navigation issue ...
[10:52:20] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, they /could/ be related - I dunno ...
[10:52:26] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah, i noticed
[10:53:04] <_|Nix|_> This latter one seems like a corner case - and I don't mean to say it's unimportant, just a corner case.
[10:53:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: it just made me think about that issue
[11:25:26] <adammessinger> Revised version of my work-around for https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4050 both refreshes initial page on return visit and caches new version in the DOM...

[11:29:57] <uGoMobi> thanks adammessinger!
[11:31:37] <adammessinger> I'll post a follow-up comment on the related issue to try and get some feedback on whether keeping the new version of the page around is really necessary. If not, it's a one-line change to stop holding onto it.
[11:32:29] <adammessinger> Still testing it out in various browsers. Will include my findings on that in the follow-up comment as well.

[11:38:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] junit setup for phantom results - John Bender
[11:38:41] <johnbender> adammessinger: uGoMobi we have to address that but it's not simple _at all_
[11:38:51] <johnbender> lots and lots of code expects that first page to exist as an anchor
[11:41:02] <johnbender> gseguin: alright I've got it dumping test suite results to junit xml
[11:41:20] <johnbender> next step is to try it out on the adobe ci and then set it up on the build server
[11:41:21] <adammessinger> johnbender: My current work around re-requests the page, makes sure the old version is removed, and that the new version is retained instead when you go elsewhere. Would that satisfy the needs of the code you mentioned?
[11:41:36] <johnbender> adammessinger: I'd have to take a long hard look
[11:41:40] <johnbender> I don't reval

[11:45:17] <uGoMobi> toddparker: what do you think about supporting multiple native select menu?
[11:48:40] <johnbender> adammessinger: an appreciated one too
[11:48:44] <johnbender> that's something we need to address
[11:48:51] <johnbender> toddparker: I was thinking we should redo the readme page
[11:49:03] <johnbender> I've got a ton of stuff to put in there and no logical place to put it
[11:49:20] <johnbender> toddparker: I can come up with a list of sections I think should be in there for the meeting on Thurs if you wan
[12:03:21] <toddparker> uGoMobi: on the read me, feel free to add and edit as needed
[12:03:42] <toddparker> maybe run it by us in a gist first but that isn't actively maintained and could have better info
[12:03:52] <uGoMobi> toddparker: johnbender ^^
[12:04:19] <toddparker> re: native selects, are we actively removing that attr if you have a native menu?
[12:04:34] <toddparker> it was poorly supposed way back when we started
[12:04:46] <toddparker> but it's better now so we can just let the devices do what they do
[12:05:03] <uGoMobi> something is blocking it
[12:05:20] <uGoMobi> but don't know what yet

[14:41:33] <uGoMobi> so Anne, you miss the purple review label?
[14:42:39] <uGoMobi> better now?
[14:42:41] <agcolom> yes, I did... did you change it?
[14:42:42] <uGoMobi> :-)
[14:43:03] <uGoMobi> yeah i made review and pending blue... the cold cases ;-)
[14:43:15] <uGoMobi> purple again now
[14:43:23] <agcolom> ah... I thought it had caught a cold...
[14:43:24] <uGoMobi> or want pink?
[14:43:28] <agcolom> Thank you :-)
[14:43:54] <agcolom> no purple is fine :-) my car is pink though (no joke)
[14:44:33] <uGoMobi> nothing wrong with pink, not sure if i would my car to be pink though
[14:44:36] <agcolom> btw, is https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4391 a duplicate of https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4113?

[14:45:36] <uGoMobi> a pink twingo sound cute
[14:47:00] <agcolom> It is :-) and it will be 17 next month!
[14:47:23] <uGoMobi> not sure it is the same Anne but related yes
[14:47:33] <uGoMobi> wow
[14:48:11] <uGoMobi> when trying to fix it you can find all related issues with "fixd toolbar" label
[14:48:37] <uGoMobi> and then see what is really the same issue
[14:49:41] <uGoMobi> are the issues with review label actually in review by someone?
[14:50:32] <agcolom> Yes, I try to add a comment with a link to other issues when I think it might be related to then helps checking and closing when one of them gets fixed
[14:50:37] <uGoMobi> is see "in review" issues with no one assigned
[14:50:45] <uGoMobi> oh ok
[14:51:52] <agcolom> in review means we are awaiting something from the issuer (test case or a simple response). Then we just go back to all the in review and close when no reponse has been given
[14:51:52] <uGoMobi> and "pending or unconfirmed means we are weating on response from person who posted issue?
[14:52:12] <uGoMobi> oh... i didnt know that
[14:52:28] <agcolom> yes, when there was no confirmation or we were unable to reproduce.
[14:53:41] <uGoMobi> that does not need a label... that needs to be closed ;-)
[14:55:35] <uGoMobi> couldn't we just use one label then? only "in review"?
[14:55:58] <uGoMobi> for we are waiting for an response or action for someone else?
[14:56:17] <uGoMobi> typo: + when
[14:56:36] <agcolom> ... could also be that we do not have the device to test... It's also a wake up for the issuer that they need to provide more info as they know unconfirmed will lead to close if they do not respond...
[14:56:59] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:57:09] <agcolom> In review is more for old issues...
[14:57:32] <uGoMobi> ah the cold cases
[14:57:34] <agcolom> it was an issue... is it still an issue?
[14:57:47] <agcolom> yes
[14:57:49] <uGoMobi> gonna make the label ice blue again
[14:57:55] <agcolom> :-)
[14:57:58] <uGoMobi> :-) bye pink/purple
[14:58:50] <agcolom> ok :-) I'm happy as long as the color means something. I though it looked cold... now I understand why. When I understand, I'm happy :-)
[14:59:12] <uGoMobi> hehe it was not random
[14:59:40] <agcolom> Good :-) I suspected it wasn't....
[14:59:44] <uGoMobi> and i wanted pending and unc. other color than the gray we use for topics
[15:00:13] <agcolom> yes, I think that'd be useful too
[15:00:40] <uGoMobi> sorry i just love organizing :-)
[15:00:44] <uGoMobi> haha
[15:01:33] <agcolom> That's a good thing!
[15:01:57] <uGoMobi> we could add a green "spring cleaning" label... when no response before summer we close
[15:02:11] <agcolom> lol
[15:03:02] <uGoMobi> talking about summer... i think it was almost 30 degrees C here today
[15:03:16] <uGoMobi> London rainy and cold as ever ;-)
[15:03:19] <agcolom> right I think I should go to bed before it gets too late... I have 3000 words to write on "assessments" for next week... I'm on about 1700!
[15:03:35] <uGoMobi> ai
[15:03:35] <agcolom> No it's been really hot the last 2 days, in particular today
[15:03:45] <uGoMobi> ah the same... nice
[15:03:58] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne

[15:51:58] <johnbender> gseguin: oh hell yah
[15:52:09] <johnbender> and then just disable the automated kickoff of the build you want
[15:52:13] <johnbender> I knew it had to be simple
[15:52:16] <gseguin> "Trigger only if build succeeds"
[15:52:34] <johnbender> gseguin: tell your informant they are awesome
[15:53:20] <gseguin> gseguin: you're awesome!
[15:53:21] <gseguin> :D
[15:53:31] <johnbender> lol nice
[15:58:43] <gseguin> johnbender: we might have to remove the .js from the test name
[15:59:05] <gseguin> it kind of messes up the output on Jenkins
[16:13:43] <johnbender> gseguin: ?
[16:13:58] <gseguin> you have the testsuite name
[16:14:08] <gseguin> and when you click you have js
[16:14:17] <gseguin> and then you have the test cases
[16:14:48] <johnbender> ahh I see what you mean
[16:15:17] <johnbender> it's expecting a java class at the end of some namespaces lol
[16:15:40] <johnbender> I have to work some more on the junit xml
[16:15:51] <johnbender> the failures are in the wrong place
