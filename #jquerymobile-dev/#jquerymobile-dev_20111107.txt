[00:40:47] <_|Nix|_> Hey! If someone sets $("selector").mywidget("option", "myOption", value), and "myOption" is documented as being available via the data-my-option attribute, then _setOption should also set this.element.attr("data-" + ($.mobile.ns || "") + "my-option", value), right?
[00:41:12] <_|Nix|_> I mean, in addition to actually applying the option ...
[00:50:06] <_|Nix|_> Hmmm ... we could really use a function that reliably parses things like "true" "yes" "on", etc. into true and "false" "no" "off" into false.
[00:50:46] <_|Nix|_> I find I'm copying the code over and over.
[07:09:41] <Wilto> ‘Morning, guys.
[07:41:56] <TehShrike|Work> 'morning!
[08:11:47] <toddmparker_> hey all
[08:11:55] <toddmparker_> did you see this pull request for a popup widget?
[08:12:16] <toddmparker_> i spoke to a guy a while back about how to break up his larger widget into small parts
[08:12:23] <toddmparker_> this is his first piece

[08:12:45] <toddmparker_> see my comments at the bottom
[08:27:55] <gseguin> 'morning
[08:28:33] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I landed the change for data-overlay-theme
[08:28:44] <Wilto> ?hi5 gseguin
[08:28:44] <bot-t> ⁵ gseguin
[08:28:57] <gseguin> heh
[08:29:00] <toddmparker_> yeah, saw that. awesome work!
[08:29:08] <toddmparker_> do the docs need updating?
[08:29:18] <toddmparker_> i can add some demos today if you havent'
[08:29:52] <gseguin> I updated the data-* page
[08:30:02] <gseguin> I haven't added demos
[08:30:27] <gseguin> did you see the change I made in the theming css files?
[08:30:32] <gseguin> does that make sense?
[08:31:14] <gseguin> I couldn't pick up only .ui-overlay-* because it is at the same level as ui-body and ui-body was taking precedence
[08:33:00] <gseguin> am I the only one having trouble with IRCCloud?
[08:33:22] <gseguin> toddmparker_: did you see timmywil's work on the repo?
[08:34:02] <gseguin> he dropped the size down to 18Mb
[08:37:30] <Wilto> gseguin: Nah, it’s been really flaky lately.
[08:43:42] <timmywil> im available today to help with the repo size, after the core meeting
[09:12:43] <johnbender> heyo!
[09:12:48] <johnbender>  86 github notifications :/
[09:12:58] <toddmparker_> gseguin: sorry, was in a quick meeting ther
[09:13:00] <toddmparker_> there
[09:13:09] <gseguin> no worries
[09:13:29] <toddmparker_> awesome work timmywil
[09:13:40] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender
[09:13:47] <gseguin> toddmparker_: it's not pushed yet
[09:13:52] <toddmparker_> ok
[09:13:57] <gseguin> but yes that's awesome
[09:15:01] <toddmparker_> so gseguin - can you point me to the css change you're referring to?
[09:15:17] * gseguin retrieves the link
[09:16:15] <gseguin> hmm
[09:16:27] <gseguin> did I push?

[09:18:31] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2951
[09:18:32] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2951 on jquery-mobile, reported by StevePo (7h, 56m ago): history.back : Strange behaviour
[09:18:33] <johnbender> logging bug?
[09:19:09] <toddmparker_> oh, i see what you did there gseguin
[09:19:17] <toddmparker_> that will work, sucks you needed to do that
[09:19:35] <toddmparker_> but that will be fixed when we re-structure the dialog markup
[09:19:44] <toddmparker_> the overlay should be a sibling, not a parent
[09:19:53] <toddmparker_> but we can't change that now
[09:20:30] <gseguin> I'm worried that I don't see this commit in the commit timeline
[09:20:57] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah, if he's using chrome
[09:21:55] <gseguin> oh there we go, found it
[09:22:05] <gseguin> it was lower than expected
[09:22:56] <kinblas> so if I have existing trees and modifications I want to commit
[09:23:12] <kinblas> are the changes that made the repo smaller going to make life difficult?
[09:23:30] <kinblas> should I just pull a fresh repo tree and move my changes there before committint?
[09:23:33] <kinblas> committing
[09:23:56] <johnbender> kinblas: I think you have to
[09:24:08] <kinblas> okie dokie
[09:24:19] <kinblas> at least it will be fast cloning new trees :-)
[09:24:20] <johnbender> I'm not sure what a merge would do in the case where they removed old history entries
[09:24:36] <kinblas> johnbender: I added a comment to that bug
[09:24:47] <johnbender> kinblas: thanks I was going to ask for a link to other bugs/etc
[09:24:52] <toddmparker_> morning kinblas
[09:25:02] <kinblas> toddmparker_: mornin'
[09:25:16] <toddmparker_> kin - what commit is this? more perf tweaks?
[09:25:33] <kinblas> toddmparker_: another tweak to listview
[09:25:40] <kinblas> that was showing up on wp7
[09:26:29] <kinblas> toddmparker_: oh that reminds me, you wanted an RC2 version of that profiling page so you can see differences right?
[09:26:52] <toddmparker_> yeah, i' dlike to be able to should osme benchmarks showing the perf improvments
[09:28:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: did you guys ever look at the loadtime measurement page that I created before I took off on Wednesday?
[09:29:08] <toddmparker_> i started to, but was distracted, sorry
[09:29:36] <toddmparker_> anyone want to make a wiki page where we can collect all this profiling stuff?
[09:29:40] <johnbender> it should be of use when tracking perf stats over time
[09:30:13] <johnbender> it's set up so we can use it to track other data points over time as well
[09:30:32] <toddmparker_> that's great
[09:30:55] <toddmparker_> is ther ea quick link i can look at or is there setup involved?
[09:31:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you have php5 installed on your test machine?
[09:31:28] <toddmparker_> i have some flavor of php. think 5
[09:31:36] <kinblas> johnbender:  yeah I took a brief peek at it
[09:31:40] <johnbender> then the only thing that needs installing is sqlite
[09:31:42] <kinblas> you were only tracking enhancement time
[09:31:45] <johnbender> for storage purposes
[09:31:48] <johnbender> kinblas: right
[09:32:15] <toddmparker_> is this something we could host up on a server or is the type of thing that should be run locally?
[09:32:24] <johnbender> it's meant to be relatively generic so we can just push stats on whatever perf tracking you want to do
[09:32:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: both
[09:32:41] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[09:33:00] <toddmparker_> if it was on a server, might be nice to be able to point to a url with results, that's all
[09:33:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I talked briefly with danheberden and we can get it set up to run under test pretty easily
[09:33:21] <toddmparker_> nice
[09:33:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that's what I was thinking
[09:34:06] <toddmparker_> so the question I have is how can we quantify the improvement from RC2 to now on key metrics?
[09:34:34] <toddmparker_> maybe we could even go back further to beatas to compare - are we improving overall?
[09:34:41] <toddmparker_> was it faster in A3? etc.
[09:35:06] <toddmparker_> so whatever tool can tell us that in a simple way that would be great
[09:36:09] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the sooner we get this setup on test the soone we can start tracking progress over time
[09:36:14] <johnbender> *sooner
[09:36:20] <johnbender> not sure how this fits in with Kin's work though
[09:36:23] <toddmparker_> gotcha
[09:36:33] <toddmparker_> kinblas?
[09:36:34] <johnbender> kinblas: did you set up anything for persisting the stats
[09:36:42] <johnbender> that was most of the work that I did
[09:36:45] <johnbender> the js was like 20 mins
[09:36:49] <toddmparker_> his page does write a file when you dump
[09:36:51] <kinblas> johnbender: no, I'm just persisting them as flat files
[09:37:27] <johnbender> johnbender: do you want me to merge in my changes and then use that bit for recording your stats?
[09:37:28] <toddmparker_> so how do these relate?
[09:37:33] <kinblas> johnbender:  http://shinarp.com/jqm/profile/profiler/viewer/user-profiles/
[09:37:37] <kinblas> you view them like this:
[09:37:47] <toddmparker_> kin's measures the time spent on enhancement only
[09:37:55] <johnbender> ah
[09:38:00] <johnbender> different data types
[09:38:01] <johnbender> all together
[09:38:08] <toddmparker_> sounds like johnbender's tool will test anything?
[09:38:13] <kinblas> http://shinarp.com/jqm/profile/profiler/viewer/view-profile.php?profile=20111104-1
[09:38:31] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm tracking stats as well as callgraphs
[09:38:46] <johnbender> hrm
[09:39:30] <toddmparker_> be cool to make that top table sortable: http://tablesorter.com/docs/
[09:39:36] <kinblas> lol
[09:39:39] <kinblas> yeah I know
[09:39:57] <kinblas> it's just suiting my needs right now
[09:40:06] <toddmparker_> just drop that sucker in. done.
[09:40:13] <kinblas> it's sorted by max call duration
[09:40:20] <kinblas> allowing me to find the calls that take the most
[09:40:33] <kinblas> the more useful thing is the call graph below
[09:40:46] <kinblas> that allows me to drill into a  graph to see where the time is being spent
[09:42:00] <kinblas> tbenzige: mornin'
[09:42:15] <johnbender> kinblas: so the numbers I started tracking are hyper simple
[09:42:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[09:42:27] <johnbender> kin's output is much more complex
[09:42:41] <kinblas> johnbender: really it's what most people want ... page X loads in this time and enhances in this time
[09:42:50] <johnbender> johnbender: thats what I'm thining
[09:42:53] <kinblas> that's the resolution folks care about
[09:42:59] <toddmparker_>  we don't need to dump all the data on people
[09:43:08] <johnbender> that's what I figured
[09:43:08] <kinblas> but if we're tweaking things, we need a bit more resolution
[09:43:14] <johnbender> kinblas: exactly
[09:43:14] <johnbender> ok
[09:43:19] <toddmparker_> i just want to know those total times benchmarked against a version of two back
[09:43:30] <johnbender> so I'll merge my changes and talk with danheberden about installing sqlite
[09:43:50] <danheberden> if we could install sqheavy, that'd be much better
[09:44:04] <toddmparker_> so we can say, on an average page page enhancement was reduced by 35-35% and on complex pages like the listview, that can mean going from 4 seconds to 2.5
[09:44:04] <danheberden> make the the files don't blow away
[09:44:21] <kinblas> johnbender: the tool only logs when times change right?
[09:44:31] <johnbender> danheberden: http://code.google.com/p/sqlheavy/?
[09:44:32] <johnbender> ?
[09:44:41] <danheberden> omg it's real
[09:44:44] <danheberden> haha
[09:44:45] <johnbender> kinblas: not sure what you mean
[09:44:54] <danheberden> my joke... RUINED
[09:45:03] <johnbender> danheberden: I wasn't 100% sure so I googled :D
[09:45:36] <kinblas> johnbender: your script polls right?
[09:45:43] <johnbender> kinblas: for rev changes
[09:45:52] <johnbender> so it will track the perf over revisions
[09:46:17] <kinblas> johnbender: right, are you going to log the time for every change? or just when something changes how long the enhancement took
[09:46:23] <johnbender> though now that I think about it, it doesn't record the revision per data point
[09:47:09] <johnbender> kinblas: logging the time for every change, since I would imagine it's not going to be exactly the same and doing the maths required to sort out what that threshold should be as the times change is beyond me
[09:48:26] <kinblas> yeah I was wondering what that +/- would be
[09:48:30] <johnbender> kinblas: thinking about it now it seems like we might want to choose a more coarse time period
[09:48:39] <johnbender> like per day or something
[09:48:55] <johnbender> although the graph output could easily be averaged per day
[09:49:51] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: alright are we at least in agreement that I should merge this and get it working on jqm.com/test/ ?
[09:50:08] <toddmparker_> yep
[09:50:27] <johnbender> kk
[09:50:34] <johnbender> going to make a few quick revisions and push
[09:51:27] <kinblas> johnbender; so I was wondering if you should make a copy of that 400 listview item file for your own purposes ... I think other folks use that for their own testing too, to see what perf is like on different devices
[09:55:10] <toddmparker_> gseguin: this bug may be from you're theming changes
[09:55:11] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2954
[09:55:11] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2954 on jquery-mobile, reported by MauriceG (1h, 41m ago): small non-native selectmenu missing header styling / body is transparent
[09:55:17] <toddmparker_> be back in a few...taco run
[09:55:57] <johnbender> johnbender: I can just leave it in as the static file and have the php record the stats
[09:56:03] <johnbender> though that might be confusing
[09:56:15] <johnbender> kinblas: I'll create a separate one
[09:56:19] <johnbender> no harm there
[09:56:30] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I'll look at it
[09:56:33] <kinblas> johnbender: ok thanks!
[10:28:35] <toddmparker_> \
[10:37:34] <johnbender> gs
[10:37:56] * johnbender has the wrong window focused
[10:40:15] <kinblas> johnbender: ping
[10:40:18] <johnbender> kinblas: yo
[10:41:10] <kinblas> johnbender: just a tip ... sometimes page instantiation is nested so you will want to account for that ... for example we instantiate page() for the page element, but it contains things like custom selects and nested lists which in turn instantiate page().
[10:43:48] <johnbender> kinblas: hrm
[10:44:13] <kinblas> johnbender: if you are only interested in the outer one ... which most folks are
[10:44:31] <kinblas> just add a lock ... record time when lock is zero or one, depending on when you increment
[10:44:34] <johnbender> kinblas: alright I'll take care of that
[10:45:04] <johnbender> ugh
[10:45:11] <johnbender> I have to deal with the tree cleanup
[10:51:10] <kinblas> toddmparker_: preliminary numbers for 400 item listview on iPad ... RC2: 3402ms, HEAD+pending-changes: 1457ms
[10:56:14] <johnbender> kinblas: won't the nested page events be triggered on the child pages?
[10:56:22] <johnbender> kinblas: I can use that for the last pageinit
[10:56:37] <johnbender> just check that the target is the same as the element to which I'm binding
[10:56:50] <kinblas> johnbender: yeah if you're tracking that
[10:56:55] <kinblas> that would work
[10:57:35] <toddmparker_> that's quite an improvement kinblas
[10:57:59] <johnbender> kinblas: cool, I used the counter for the page before create and the element check for the pageinit
[10:58:09] <kinblas> toddmparker_: btw, that's just page enhancement
[10:58:16] <kinblas> still feels freakin' slow
[10:58:23] <kinblas> so there's still more room for improvement
[10:58:28] <toddmparker_> yeah, well we can't make networks faster
[10:58:48] <toddmparker_> what is that, close to a 60% improvement?
[10:59:31] <toddmparker_> keeping pages buffered in the dom will help too
[10:59:31] <kinblas> toddmparker_: you wish :-) ... 42%
[10:59:41] <toddmparker_> having to re-enhance when you hit back is a waste
[10:59:48] <toddmparker_> i can't do math
[10:59:58] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah, that's where caching comes into play
[11:00:00] <toddmparker_> 42.8% if you must
[11:00:04] <toddmparker_> yeah
[11:01:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so while I have your attention ... a question regarding listview icons and thumbs
[11:01:13] <kinblas> I see this in the code:
[11:01:20] <toddmparker_> gseguin: see this pull for that issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2957
[11:01:20] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by MauriceG (45m, 30s ago): Fix for issue #2954 select-dialog missing header-styling
[11:01:27] <toddmparker_> sure kinblas
[11:01:35] <kinblas> toddmparker_: .find( ">img:eq(0), .ui-link-inherit>img:eq(0)" )
[11:01:40] <kinblas> what is the idea  here
[11:01:52] <Wilto> Whoa.
[11:02:02] <kinblas> first image that is a descendant of the li?
[11:02:05] <toddmparker_> not sure
[11:02:08] <toddmparker_> think so
[11:02:09] <kinblas> or is that any image that is the descendant
[11:02:12] <kinblas> of any element?
[11:02:49] * kinblas notices he busted the split list sample ... related to that
[11:02:58] <kinblas> ... in my local tree
[11:03:09] <kinblas> so I want to get down to what exactly is being expected
[11:03:12] <Wilto> The first image that is the first child of the targeted element, and the first image that is the first child of .ui-link-inherit.
[11:03:32] <kinblas> Wilto: so if that' find is being called on an li
[11:03:43] <kinblas> it is li > img.eq(0) ?
[11:03:48] <Wilto> Look one level down from that <li> for the first image.
[11:03:53] <kinblas> just asking because if I can add the li  ... it shaves off an additional 200ms
[11:03:58] <toddmparker_> i think this may be to see if there is a link there so the thumbnail class can be added?
[11:04:06] <Wilto> Oh, no then.
[11:04:26] <Wilto> Because it’s saying “within the context of the first child of the element that .find is being called on.”
[11:04:27] <toddmparker_> the image would be inside the li for sure
[11:04:58] <Wilto> So you’d then be saying “within any li, within the first context available to each, target the first image.”
[11:05:20] <Wilto> You could swap .find('>… for .children(), however.
[11:05:23] <Wilto> That might be faster.
[11:05:45] <kinblas> Wilto: toddmparker_: This is what I'm questioning: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.listview.js#L46
[11:06:16] <toddmparker_> ok, that's what i thought
[11:06:35] <kinblas> so is that: li > img:eq(0) ??
[11:06:43] <toddmparker_> so kinblas, are you saying that we can tighten the scope up a bit to make this faster?
[11:06:44] <Wilto> Hm. One sec…
[11:06:46] <kinblas> or is that: * > img:eq(0)
[11:07:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 5 new commits to master: http://git.io/z1IBUg
[11:07:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] seperate stats recording from stat caculation, add timestamp - John Bender
[11:07:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] move the list perf test to a different naming scheme - John Bender
[11:07:05] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] readd lists-ul html - John Bender
[11:07:23] <kinblas> toddmparker_: from what I'm seeing yeah
[11:07:24] <Wilto> “item” > img…
[11:07:24] <toddmparker_> not sure about that Q kinblas
[11:07:26] <johnbender> I wish I could get my fingers to spell separate properly
[11:07:29] <Wilto> So, in this case, the li.
[11:07:34] <kinblas> adding an li shaves off 200ms
[11:07:44] <toddmparker_> i'd say for for that
[11:07:58] <toddmparker_> that is a very clear case where no other pattern is ok
[11:08:01] <johnbender> danheberden: sqlite3. I needs to install it
[11:08:09] <Wilto> But that’s gonna say “find an li inside item and find the first image in each.”
[11:08:21] <kinblas> Wilto: heh sorry
[11:08:23] <kinblas> I changed it from
[11:08:26] <Wilto> Nah, no worries.
[11:08:26] <kinblas> item.find(...
[11:08:30] <kinblas> to list.find(...
[11:08:36] <Wilto> Ah-hah.
[11:08:48] <Wilto> Is that gonna mess up the context of the second selector, though?
[11:09:07] <kinblas> why?
[11:09:14] <kinblas> .ui-link-inherit can live anywhere
[11:09:25] <kinblas> oh ok duh, let me paste what i"m doing
[11:09:28] <kinblas> that makes it faster
[11:09:52] <kinblas> $list.find( "li >img:eq(0), .ui-link-inherit>img:eq(0)" )
[11:10:05] <kinblas> I just want to make sure that is the equivalent of what we were doing before
[11:10:06] <kinblas> which was
[11:10:11] <Wilto> Ahh.
[11:10:15] <kinblas> item.find( ">img:eq(0), .ui-link-inherit>img:eq(0)" )
[11:10:28] <kinblas> so basically instead of doing that call 400 times
[11:10:30] <kinblas> I'm doing it once
[11:10:44] <toddmparker_> cool, that makes sense to me
[11:10:50] <Wilto> Yep, makes sense.
[11:10:56] <kinblas> ok so just to confirm
[11:10:59] <toddmparker_> tho if some list items have images and others don't
[11:11:00] <kinblas> we really want li > img
[11:11:08] <kinblas> first child image of li
[11:11:12] <toddmparker_> yes
[11:11:14] <kinblas> ok
[11:11:16] <toddmparker_> that is a thumbnail
[11:11:22] <toddmparker_> unless the image has the icon class
[11:11:35] <Wilto> I’m not sure what the performance impact is, but $list.find( "li >img:eq(0), li .ui-link-inherit>img:eq(0)" ) would also work.
[11:11:52] <Wilto> I don’t know the selector engine voodoo, though.
[11:12:18] <kinblas> Wilto: I think it's the "> that is killing things
[11:12:19] <kinblas> the non-specified parent that is
[11:12:30] <Wilto> Oh, fo’ sho’.
[11:12:40] <kinblas> ok I'm going to do some testing
[11:12:46] <Wilto> Godspeed, sir.
[11:12:58] <kinblas> heh
[11:13:22] <toddmparker_> sounds like a good tweak tho
[11:13:29] <toddmparker_> sure there are others like that in listview
[11:13:33] <toddmparker_> thing is a beast
[11:14:11] <toddmparker_> johnbender, gseguin, kinblas, Wilto - you guys see this little popup widget
[11:14:12] <toddmparker_> http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/jquery-mobile-popup/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[11:14:17] <toddmparker_> (i posted it earlier)
[11:14:53] <Wilto> Oh, didn’t see the demo—that’s pretty slick.
[11:14:55] <toddmparker_> i commented with some changes I'd like to see. WOuld be good to have him release it as a 3rd party plugin for now

[11:14:56] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (11h, 21m ago): Popup widget
[11:15:01] <kinblas> toddmparker: was that the subpages one?
[11:15:03] <toddmparker_> can't pull this in now anyway
[11:15:08] <toddmparker_> nope
[11:15:17] <toddmparker_> this lets you open little popups
[11:15:26] <toddmparker_> can use it for menus, info panels, etc.
[11:15:31] <kinblas> was opening full pages for me
[11:15:37] <toddmparker_> widget container for a datepicker, etc.
[11:15:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we need to sort out a way for people to create an register plugins
[11:16:01] <kinblas> oh heh, I was clicking on the wrong things
[11:16:01] <Wilto> Oof, not it.
[11:16:14] <johnbender> I don't mean in the code though
[11:16:17] <johnbender> just a plugin list
[11:16:20] <Wilto> Ahh.
[11:16:23] <johnbender> since creating plugins is doable now
[11:16:26] <johnbender> for better or worse
[11:16:31] <johnbender> but we need to have that discussion too
[11:16:48] <johnbender> we'd be better served in keeping the core of the library as small as possible
[11:16:50] <toddmparker_> johnbender: do you mean that we need to collect all these 3rd party pluigns?
[11:16:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah
[11:17:09] <johnbender> we're struggling to keep up with the bug reports and issues with the code base we have now
[11:17:11] <toddmparker_> i'm planning on adding pages for that when i get  chance
[11:17:16] <johnbender> let alone if we start taking this stuff into the core
[11:17:16] <toddmparker_> there are a lot now
[11:17:28] <toddmparker_> for sure
[11:17:48] <toddmparker_> if we can get people to follow our conventions, it won't matter too much if they are 3rd party or ours
[11:18:16] <toddmparker_> in fact, we could even add the ability to add 3rd party widgets in the downlaoder to make it seamless w/o taking on the burden
[11:18:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: part of that is sorting out how we do plugins internally if we haven't already done that as part of the perf stuff
[11:18:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: I merged in the perf recording
[11:18:55] <toddmparker_> thanks johnbender
[11:19:02] <johnbender> I just have to check with danheberden about installing sqlite3 on the server
[11:19:12] <johnbender> and then I can make a pretty graph
[11:19:12] <kinblas> johnbender: great!
[11:19:22] <Wilto> NOW we’re talkin’.
[11:19:31] <toddmparker_> i want to figure out how to keep adding widgets without getting mired in the ui situation where they keep re-factoring the same set
[11:19:38] <danheberden> johnbender go for it
[11:19:45] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: is there any interest in using that dendrogram that I sent you guys for navigating the perf profile that kin is creating?
[11:19:50] <toddmparker_> encouraging 3rd party widgets that work like we'd build 'em is a good start
[11:20:03] <kinblas> johnbender: I couldn't watch the movie
[11:20:11] <toddmparker_> me neither
[11:20:15] <toddmparker_> i need to get vlc
[11:20:15] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_
[11:20:18] <Wilto> “Dendrogram” sounds like a skin condition.
[11:20:18] <johnbender> sigh
[11:20:21] <johnbender> sorry about that
[11:20:23] <toddmparker_> i'm itchy
[11:20:30] <kinblas> Wilto: lol
[11:20:33] <johnbender> I tried uploading to youtube but it didn't like the ogv without sound

[11:44:48] <toddmparker_> thanks johnbender
[11:45:06] <toddmparker_> do we need to make a real change in the css for this
[11:45:07] <kinblas> johnbender: nope
[11:45:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm starting to wonder
[11:45:34] <toddmparker_> seems like this cropped up recently
[11:45:37] <kinblas> johnbender: danheberden or eddiemonge might
[11:45:39] <johnbender> yah
[11:45:46] <johnbender> kinblas: yah I think danheberden is out
[11:45:52] <johnbender> for a moment or two at least
[11:45:54] <toddmparker_> gseguin, did you see that pull above ^^
[11:46:03] <toddmparker_> yeah johnbender
[11:46:05] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I did
[11:46:10] <gseguin> I will look at it
[11:46:40] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I'll do that after lunch though
[11:47:36] * kinblas grumbles and gives back 500ms
[11:52:19] <Wilto> Back to the universe, reclaimed from jQM?
[11:52:23] <Wilto> Or vice-versa?
[12:00:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the php package for redhat based distros is built without sqlite support, I have to get that sorted before we can use the page I created
[12:00:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: going to get some food first since I haven't eaten today
[12:00:53] <toddmparker_> kinblas: what happened?
[12:01:32] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I'm trying to figure out how to make that img selector thingie work
[12:01:39] <toddmparker_> ah
[12:01:46] <toddmparker_> no dice?
[12:01:54] <kinblas> basically we want the 1st image under an li and the 1st image under a ui-link-inherit
[12:02:19] <kinblas> toddmparker_: we're still faster by moving it out of the loop, but I want to try and make that faster
[12:02:29] <toddmparker_> DO IT
[12:02:34] <kinblas> so question
[12:02:38] <Wilto> First image under the first li?
[12:02:48] <toddmparker_> yessssssss/
[12:02:54] <kinblas> toddmparker_: heh apparently that's where the speed up came from
[12:03:01] <kinblas> and why I broke that listview sample
[12:03:02] <kinblas> :-D
[12:03:15] <kinblas> it was only applying stuff to the 1st images because of that eq(0)
[12:03:40] <toddmparker_> first list item?
[12:03:54] <kinblas> yeah
[12:04:00] <kinblas> it was getting all of the li>img
[12:04:06] <kinblas> and then only getting the first of the bunch
[12:04:14] <kinblas> apparently that's what :eq(0) does
[12:04:22] <kinblas> first of the set of results
[12:04:29] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so question
[12:04:44] <toddmparker_> ah
[12:05:16] <kinblas> toddmparker_: regarding this: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.listview.js#L46
[12:05:16] <kinblas> [11:06am]
[12:06:15] <kinblas> toddmparker_: is it possible for a given li to have both an img under li and an image under a link with a ui-ink-inherit on it?
[12:06:51] <toddmparker_> hmm
[12:06:58] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I guess what I'm wondering is if a given li can have both ui-li-has-icon and ui-li-has-thumb
[12:07:08] <toddmparker_> dont think so
[12:07:10] <kinblas> certainly seems that way from the code
[12:07:17] <toddmparker_> actually no
[12:07:39] <kinblas> ??
[12:08:07] <kinblas> < li ><img> ... <a><img></a> .. </li>

[12:08:30] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Merge pull request #2958 from TylerBenziger/master - Todd Parker
[12:09:21] <Wilto> Actually, I think I recall seeing that.
[12:09:43] <Wilto> There’s a list somewhere with little flag icons as thumbnails… I might be mis-remembering.
[12:09:47] <Wilto> But I thought that had both.
[12:10:06] <kinblas> Wilto: ok so it's possible to have 2 images per li that need processing like this?
[12:10:30] <Wilto> No, it was still one image. Maybe it was applying twice in those situations?
[12:10:36] <kinblas> Wilto: http://localhost/~jblas/jquery-mobile/docs/lists/lists-icons.html
[12:10:40] <Wilto> You probably shouldn’t quote me on any of this. I’ll see if I can dig it up.
[12:11:48] <toddmparker_> i don't think we need to worry about this
[12:11:53] <toddmparker_> at least in our patterns
[12:11:54] <Wilto> Nope, that’s the one—my mistake.
[12:11:54] <Wilto> Sorry!
[12:11:59] <toddmparker_> others may have done other stuff
[12:12:12] <kinblas> I guess what I'm wondering is this
[12:12:19] <toddmparker_> but we look for either a thubnail or icon and add a class to the list o set widths and such
[12:12:26] <toddmparker_> so they don't really mix
[12:12:27] <kinblas> an li is either ui-li-has-icon *OR* ui-li-has-thumb?
[12:12:38] <toddmparker_> i belive so
[12:12:42] <kinblas> *OR*
[12:12:43] <toddmparker_> at least that's how our demos work
[12:13:09] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-inset.html
[12:13:12] <kinblas> an li with have either an image that is the direct descendant of the li *OR* a link with ui-link-inherit
[12:13:14] <kinblas> but never both?
[12:13:21] <toddmparker_> might have diffierent lists on a page
[12:13:33] <toddmparker_> but not both and icon + thumb in a li
[12:15:11] <kinblas> ok what I"m wondering is if I can do this
[12:15:42] <kinblas> li.find( "> img, .ui-link-inherit > img" ).eq( 0 )
[12:17:13] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I think I'll checkin what I have it reduces what we have on the HEAD by 350ms anyways
[12:17:21] <kinblas> it was nicer when it was 850 :-D
[12:20:23] <johnbender> Perf - it's what's for dinner
[12:20:40] <toddmparker_> that would be greeat. 850ms is a ton for that one check
[12:20:49] <toddmparker_> that page didn't even use thumbnails did it
[12:21:34] <toddmparker_> kinblas: the has-thumb and has-icon are mutually exclusive
[12:21:59] <toddmparker_>  the styles change the left padding and min height for the li

[12:22:18] <kinblas> toddmparker_: right, the 400 item listview doesn't even use images
[12:22:24] <toddmparker_> if you put a second image in there, it should sort fo leave it alone
[12:22:45] <toddmparker_> but it shouldn't add both classes because they interfere
[12:22:55] <toddmparker_> so it that rules save 500m, do it
[12:32:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: switch the perf stuff over to PDO :(
[12:32:59] <johnbender> http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.pdo-sqlite.php
[12:32:59] <toddmparker_> PDO?
[12:33:34] <johnbender> the sqlite driver isn't compiled in for the redhat php package (the server is centos)
[12:33:43] <johnbender> that pdo driver is though
[12:34:02] <johnbender> pdo_sqlite that is
[12:34:07] <johnbender> so I need to rework it a tad
[12:34:09] <johnbender> to use that
[12:34:31] <kinblas> johnbender: it's not just a php.ini switch?
[12:34:33] <kinblas> to turn it on?
[12:35:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: is this a regression?
[12:35:11] <kinblas> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/lists/lists-forms.html
[12:35:31] <kinblas> if you go there and click on the last select menu on the page, the custom select comes up, but it has no background ... so you see through the title bar
[12:36:00] <toddmparker_> it is. gseguin is assigned
[12:36:14] <toddmparker_> seems like 2 issues: the overlay theme isn't right
[12:36:20] <toddmparker_> and there is a header in there

[13:45:29] <toddmparker_> gotcha kinblas

[13:46:30] <toddmparker_> yeah, that's huge
[13:46:41] <toddmparker_> esp. because not all pages even need that markup pattern
[13:47:03] <toddmparker_> i really think that is safe
[13:47:16] <toddmparker_> the thumb and icon are mutually exclusivve
[13:49:01] <kinblas> toddmparker: so if I find an image that is the direct descendant of the li, it's safe to assume I don't have to search for ui-link-inherit > img?
[13:49:39] <toddmparker_> i guess i'm not sure what the -inherit is for
[13:49:58] <toddmparker_> that would be a class on the link that wraps it?
[13:50:10] <kinblas> toddmparker_: we always find the links in the  li, then we mark the first one with ui-link-inherit
[13:58:07] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah that ui-link-inherit is a class placed on the first link in the li. We look for the first image in that link
[13:58:37] <toddmparker_> i'd need to see what that is used for
[13:59:08] <toddmparker_> because we will have li's with img tags
[13:59:16] <toddmparker_> and those with a link around the image
[13:59:25] <toddmparker_> so both cases exist
[13:59:30] <toddmparker_> kinblas ^^
[13:59:49] <kinblas> yeah that's why I was asking earlier
[14:00:18] <toddmparker_> so i can see people mixing linked and unlined thumbnail list items
[14:00:23] <toddmparker_> so we'd need to check for both?
[14:00:41] <kinblas> we do check for both
[14:00:58] <toddmparker_> yeah, so i guess i'm saying we can't skip that as you suggest above
[14:01:06] <toddmparker_> unless i'm misunderstanding
[14:01:08] <kinblas> toddmparker_: which is why I asked if there could ever be a case where one was an icon and one was thumb
[14:01:29] <toddmparker_> meaning the 1st LI has a thumb
[14:01:35] <toddmparker_> the 2nd LI has an icon
[14:02:08] <kinblas> meaning an li could have 2 images show up (one in li and one in ui-link-inherit)
[14:02:09] <toddmparker_> it's possible, but not likely
[14:02:17] <kinblas> one with ui-li-icon and the other without
[14:02:23] <kinblas> which would mean they could both get
[14:02:34] <kinblas> ui-li-has-icon and ui-li-hash-thumb
[14:02:51] <toddmparker_> so within a single LI, there being 2 images, one in a link and the other not?
[14:03:03] <toddmparker_> no
[14:03:18] <toddmparker_> i don't think we need to support having both images within a single LI
[14:03:25] <toddmparker_> you are off the reservation
[14:03:36] <toddmparker_> those apply contradictory styles anyway
[14:03:58] <toddmparker_> they thumb and icon styles are incompatible on a single LI
[14:04:23] <toddmparker_> does that makes sense
[14:04:27] <toddmparker_> kinblas ^
[14:04:40] <johnbender> Sweet baby jesus hallelujah!
[14:05:19] <toddmparker_> ? johnbender - db fixed?

[14:05:22] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2066 on jquery-mobile, reported by ryantofteland (3m, 3w ago): Select Menus won't open when pages are within FORM element
[14:05:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: finally
[14:06:04] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/speed/lists-ul-record.php
[14:06:15] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/speed/stats/u
[14:06:18] <johnbender> toddmparker_: http://jquerymobile.com/test/tests/speed/stats/
[14:06:23] <johnbender> to view the json output
[14:07:36] <kinblas> sweet, now we just need a viewer for it :-)
[14:07:39] <toddmparker_> cool, so it loggs the time and UA for each visitor?
[14:07:44] <toddmparker_> yeah
[14:08:33] <kinblas> geez can that UA string get any longer?
[14:09:35] <kinblas> I'm  a UA string, and I'm going to mention every engine and browser because they are needed for compatibility?
[14:10:44] <johnbender> kinblas: viewer is next
[14:10:55] <johnbender> kinblas: and I agreed :(
[14:10:58] <johnbender> -d
[14:11:02] <johnbender> the ua string is insane
[14:11:20] <toddmparker_> hey guys - gotta head home
[14:11:23] <toddmparker_> but i'll be on later
[14:11:34] <kinblas> toddmparker_: slacker!
[14:11:38] <toddmparker_> kinblas: do you have the answers you need to make that LI tweak for images
[14:11:44] <toddmparker_> :)
[14:12:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I think so, I think what I'm going to do though is just make it call things less
[14:12:04] <toddmparker_> if you make that 500ms fix, we'll be at 50% improvement, huh?
[14:12:11] <toddmparker_> great
[14:12:19] <kinblas> well that 42% included the 500ms I gave back
[14:12:21] <toddmparker_> btw - i tweeted that 1.0 is within 2 weeks
[14:12:26] <kinblas> lol
[14:12:30] <kinblas> nothing like a little pressure
[14:12:33] <toddmparker_> yep
[14:12:36] <toddmparker_> think we're doing ok
[14:12:47] <toddmparker_> we need to track down this select issue on android
[14:15:02] <toddmparker_> later

[16:44:21] <johnbender> kinblas: toddmparker_: well I'm dumping tables of the data at least but I still have to sort out some issues with the visualize plugin
[16:44:28] <johnbender> and how it's rendering said tables
[16:44:39] <kinblas> ok
[16:49:27] <johnbender> kinblas: ok I stole their css and now it works nice :D
