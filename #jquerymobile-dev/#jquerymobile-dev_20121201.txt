[02:35:09] <agcolom> Hi, anyone around??? There's a problem with the sliders...
[02:35:39] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ uGoMobi toddmparker johnbender ^
[02:36:11] <agcolom> the sliders are now in the input field, see http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/slider/
[02:39:24] <agcolom> arschmitz: ^
[02:40:05] <agcolom> I think it could be due to changes to textinput (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/d9a3269fd117...6161878a9423)
[02:43:07] <agcolom> no, it's not due to that ^ as this is not in master, sorry....
[02:44:45] <uGoMobi> agcolom: thanks, I will look at it
[02:52:02] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Good morning :-)
[02:52:26] <uGoMobi> goodmorning agcolom

[02:54:28] <agcolom> uGoMobi: oh, that was quick!
[02:54:35] <uGoMobi> :)
[02:55:37] <uGoMobi> i though about that slider number input when we added new option clear button for text inputs... but I forgot about it when making other changes yesterday :(
[02:56:11] <uGoMobi> so I already knew where to fix the problem :)
[02:57:59] <uGoMobi> I have to add a unit test for this
[03:12:15] <agcolom> Yes, that's what I thought... It would have taken me ages to find what was causing the problem
