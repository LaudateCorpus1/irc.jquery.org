[07:22:52] <gseguin> mornin'
[07:34:56] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: you here?
[09:02:14] <toddmparker___> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5911 seems like it might be worth looking at perf-wise
[09:02:14] <b-ot> toddmparker___: Issue #5911 by DzenisevichK (9h 39m ago): Collapsibleset: Performance optimization for accordion
[09:18:59] <arschmitz> toddmparker: would have to look a bit closer but :not is one of the slowest selectors there is 
[09:19:08] <arschmitz> so this might not help
[09:19:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker___^^
[09:20:27] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: also jquery selectors work right to left so starting with a super slow selector might not be a great idea
[09:21:47] <toddmparker___> true. 
[09:21:53] <arschmitz> using not there will still select the same set
[09:22:03] <arschmitz> but then use a very slow selector to filter that set
[09:22:10] <arschmitz> so this would actually be slower
[09:22:23] <toddmparker___> mind commenting and closing
[09:22:30] <arschmitz> sure 
[09:27:51] <arschmitz> toddmparker___: working from home today since everything is shut down?
[09:28:12] <toddmparker___> yep, crazy day
[09:28:16] <toddmparker___> how was nyc
[09:28:19] <arschmitz> crazy week
[09:28:23] <toddmparker___> haven't chatted in a while
[09:28:24] <arschmitz> it was a lot of fun
[09:28:36] <toddmparker___> looks like you went to some nice places
[09:28:45] <arschmitz> yeah a lot of drama going on on the home front this week iv been kinda mia
[09:28:59] <arschmitz> yeah went to some awesome places while there
[09:29:08] <arschmitz> saw a show on broadway
[09:29:09] <gseguin> arschmitz: could you double check my commit from yesterday: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/133c81a464af67f305bfa9927b408ed24e943926 ?
[09:29:09] <b-ot> gseguin: Ghislain Seguin (12h 10m ago): Widgets: Use _on, _off and _setOptions
[09:29:31] <arschmitz> gseguin already did when i saw it
[09:29:57] <gseguin> is it aligned with what you guys have been planning ?
[09:30:28] * gseguin is a little out of that loop with all the build / CI work
[09:30:59] <arschmitz> gseguin: only thing i would say is that create is way too much of a monster and needs to be broken down into seperate private methods
[09:31:15] <arschmitz> espically handleExpandedCollapse
[09:31:33] <gseguin> arschmitz: yeah, totally agree but at first I wanted to change as few as possible
[09:31:41] <arschmitz> yeah absolutly
[09:31:50] <gseguin> now that I know I'm on the good path I'll clean it up
[09:31:58] <arschmitz> sweet
[09:32:33] <gseguin> btw I have been using sinon.js at work and been very happy with it
[09:32:58] <gseguin> it's really awesome for unit testing, you can stub any method of an object
[09:33:02] <arschmitz> personally im in favor of makeing all event binding functions methods that way if someone wants to extend the widget they have the ability to easily overwrite or extend them
[09:33:09] <arschmitz> exactly!
[09:33:09] <gseguin> and it plays very well with qunit
[09:33:33] <arschmitz> yup testing and extensibility are 2 major wins of seperate privtate methods
[09:34:01] <gseguin> I think we should talk about it and maybe do a test branch
[09:34:14] <gseguin> I'll see if I have time this coming week
[09:34:32] <arschmitz> gseguin did you ever see the google doc widget punch list i made and went over with scott_gonzalez?
[09:34:40] <gseguin> oh I forgot, I'm off next week so you should see much less of me
[09:34:44] <gseguin> arschmitz: I did
[09:34:51] <arschmitz> sweet just wanted to make sure
[09:34:58] <gseguin> that's what I based my refactoring on
[09:35:06] <arschmitz> awesome
[09:37:14] <arschmitz> gseguin: when ever you have a chance to set up that branch we should deff get johnbender and _|Nix| in on it and have a look / discussion about it
[09:37:29] <arschmitz> anything to improve testing im all about
[09:56:51] <toddmparker___> great to get your help gseguin 
[09:58:42] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker___: Is there an accessible way to use icon fonts yet?
[10:00:19] <toddmparker___> scott_gonzalez: there are ways to make them more accessible, but it's far from perfect
[10:00:34] <scott_gonzalez> That's what I though. Thanks.
[10:00:38] <scott_gonzalez> s/though/thought/
[10:00:42] <toddmparker___> there are also compatibility issues to consider. uGoMobi and i are doing some testing now
[10:01:16] <toddmparker___> http://pictos.cc/articles/using-icon-fonts/
[10:01:47] <scott_gonzalez> I'm building up my energy to reply to https://forum.jquery.com/topic/is-it-time-to-replace-png-icons-of-jquery-ui-css-framework-with-vector-based-web-fonts#14737000004078145 :-P
[10:03:20] <toddmparker___> i'd say that we're researching it now. using multiple png sprite sheets for SD and HD is a nightmare
[10:03:55] <toddmparker___> so i'd like ot move to vector - either SVG with fallbacks (grunticon) or icon fonts (if we can mitigate accessibility concerns and align with browser support)
[10:04:43] <toddmparker___> Test page using font icons in jQM: http://view.jquerymobile.com/next/demos/test/icons/font-icons.php
[10:04:55] <toddmparker___> @scottgonzalez ^
[10:05:30] <scott_gonzalez> I suppose Web Components can solve this problem.
[10:05:42] <scott_gonzalez> But it'll be a while before we can use that.
[10:06:27] <toddmparker___> yeah. we do need a more workable solution now. but people use these techniques without really thinking about where it will break and how that affects accessibility
[10:06:32] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: you here?
[10:06:54] <uGoMobi> hey toddmparker___ 
[10:06:58] <toddmparker___> i pasted the wrong link into the meeting notes from yesterday. we have a test spreadsheet we're working on now
[10:07:21] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi: do you have that google spreadsheet link handy? i'm at home and misplaced the link
[10:07:26] <uGoMobi> https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdEFwbzNFSmJjWUd1dkZldDY4MVFyR0E#gid=0
[10:08:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: What's up?
[10:09:45] <toddmparker___> thanks uGoMobi 
[10:10:09] <uGoMobi> np
[10:10:42] <toddmparker___> scott_gonzalez: Compatibility result testing in progress for icons: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AskujzE4Ig0QdEFwbzNFSmJjWUd1dkZldDY4MVFyR0E#gid=0
[10:11:11] <toddmparker___> my issue with icon fonts is it's hard to figure out fallback if they don't load.
[10:12:04] <scott_gonzalez> Well, if the font doesn't load don't you have the same experience as if a sprite didn't load?
[10:12:16] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: wanted another pair of eyes on my commit, arschmitz looked at it
[10:12:16] <scott_gonzalez> Or do you mean devices that don't have support?
[10:12:23] <scott_gonzalez> As opposed to just a network error.
[10:14:19] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker___: Oh, I see what you mean.
[10:14:28] <scott_gonzalez> If the font doesn't load, then you get random characters instead of an icon.
[10:14:34] <toddmparker___> right
[10:15:00] <toddmparker___> so if you're depending on the icon being there and icon fonts aren't supported...
[10:15:23] <scott_gonzalez> Yeah, that seems much worse than a sprite not loading.
[10:15:32] <toddmparker___> we start with text but hide that accessibly for icon-only buttons. no help if the icon isn't visible
[10:15:32] <scott_gonzalez> no icons > random characters
[10:15:43] <toddmparker___> right
[10:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> We should have a single page that documents all of this.
[10:16:41] <scott_gonzalez> Do you happen to have one or is this spread across lots of sites and floating in people's heads?
[10:16:59] <toddmparker___> i want to do a full test sweep and add it to that spreadsheet...earlier tests: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/Fonts-for-icons---support-on-mobile-browsers
[10:17:48] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Sure!
[10:17:51] <_|Nix|_> Which commit?
[10:18:09] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/133c81a464af67f305bfa9927b408ed24e943926
[10:18:09] <b-ot> gseguin: Ghislain Seguin (12h 59m ago): Widgets: Use _on, _off and _setOptions
[10:18:32] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Oh, that one ... I've already followed it up with one of my own.
[10:18:46] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I moved handleExpandCollapse out into a widget-level function.
[10:18:52] <toddmparker___> scott_gonzalez: pretty grim on older browsers - BB 4-7, WP, iOS3, etc.
[10:19:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Otherwise, looks good.
[10:19:43] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The only other thing I can think of is to set all the other options inside _setOption, not just collapsed.
[10:20:01] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: All the themes and stuff. They should be updated in that function.
[10:20:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: In fact, _setOptions is the only place where we should apply themes and stuff.
[10:20:37] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: All that addClass() stuff inside _create should be moved to _setOptions.
[10:21:02] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... keeping in mind that the sole argument to _setOptions will not always contain all the options.
[10:21:39] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, _setOptions may end up being a sequence of if ( o.something !== undefined ) {} if ( o.somethingElse !== undefined ) {} ... 
[10:21:50] <toddmparker___> uGoMobi and scott_gonzalez - I'd like to investigate using feature detection with a fallback, like - http://dfcb.github.io/iconfont-fallback/
[10:22:28] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: We should also consider what we'd do about o.disabled ... that's not an options of the collapsible widget, but it is an option of the superclass.
[10:22:37] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker___: The tricky part of a fallback is that people will forget to use t.
[10:25:02] <toddmparker___> for sure. we'd need to bake that in if we went in this direction
[10:25:34] <toddmparker___> that's what we did for grunticon - http://filamentgroup.com/lab/grunticon/
[10:25:39] <toddmparker___> the other contender
[10:25:59] <toddmparker___> use data uri'd svg, fallback to png
[10:26:11] <toddmparker___> but at least automate it via grunt
[10:26:40] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: yeah I was telling arschmitz that I wanted to take it one step at a time
[10:26:46] <toddmparker___> a hard problem to solve well, but worth it
[10:27:16] <toddmparker___> scott_gonzalez: so fallbacks would need to be baked in so people do the right thing w/o knowing it
[10:27:52] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker___: Right, but that's not possible outside of a framework (assuming the fallback requires some action).
[10:28:15] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: That's cool. I guess I did one step for you then :)
[10:28:24] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: cool thanks for the review, I'll do more work on it soon
[10:28:28] <gseguin> heh :)
[10:28:39] <scott_gonzalez> For example, with http://dfcb.github.io/iconfont-fallback/ people wouldn't call the fallback method on dynamic content.

[10:30:49] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'm in the process of converting all those .jqmData() calls to $.mobile.getAttribute()
[10:31:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So as to improve the instantiation time of collapsible sets.
[10:31:32] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5911 is also worth considering as a performance improvement.
[10:31:32] <b-ot> _|Nix|_: Issue #5911 by DzenisevichK (11h 9m ago): Collapsibleset: Performance optimization for accordion
[10:32:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: BTW: Cleaning up the code has come at a slight performance hit: http://jsperf.com/collapsible-cleanup
[10:33:14] <gseguin> darn
[10:34:41] <toddmparker___> scott_gonzalez: that's true. we could ship with a small set of icons that have fallbacks but would need to get people to run a grunt task or something to do that to a custom set
[10:34:45] <toddmparker___> tricky stuff
[10:34:56] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think it's OK. We'll make it up elsewhere.
[10:35:16] <scott_gonzalez> toddmparker___: I'm going to test out something crazy, but even if it works, we won't be able to use it :-P
[10:35:31] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I think the key is to keep track of changes from a perf perspective as well. Currently it's really time-consuming, but grunt --modules really helps.
[10:35:35] <toddmparker___> go for it...curious to see what you have in mind
[10:36:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: All my jsperf.com tests use custom builds with two copies of a widget in the build: the old and the new.

[13:27:51] <chilversc> I'm not sure the advise about ajax navigation and unique IDs is quite correct, it misses out the scenario where you're navigating to the same server page with different parameters such as ?page=1, ?page=2, or reloading the same page

[13:36:20] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I simply add a link to them into my commit message's second line.
[13:37:17] <gseguin> ok, but we should automate that perf testing and get some notification when there is a regression
[13:37:22] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'd say before we make a release we should do an overall performance assessment wrt. the previous release.
[13:37:36] <_|Nix|_> Of course. I think johnbender is working on that.
[13:38:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: The instantiation times of widgets would be a major performance monitoring task.
[13:38:48] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: However, I'm not sure how we could do this without a server-side bit to record all the various runs on all the various browsers for all the various commitid.
[13:38:54] <gseguin> I'll try to sync up with Bender on that
[13:39:08] <_|Nix|_> I wonder ... does git allow one to annotate a commitid?
[13:39:50] <_|Nix|_> ... though maybe we should just store everything in a sqlite db ...
[13:40:15] <gseguin> isnt that what browserscope is for?
[13:40:26] * gseguin has no idea
[13:40:29] <_|Nix|_> OTOH, it'd be nice to collect data from all of us who run these tests ...
[13:40:35] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Yeah, and jsperf.com uses it.
[13:40:46] <gseguin> can't we use it?
[13:40:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: However, I'm not sure if you can just throw data at browserscope like that.
[13:40:59] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I hope so.
[13:41:02] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: http://www.browserscope.org/user/tests/howto
[13:42:21] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK, so they're like "yes, please, pleeease throw your data at us" :)
[13:43:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: So, what is this test id thing? Is that for free?
[13:43:31] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Looks like an API key.
[13:44:14] <gseguin> that you probably get with your account
[13:44:25] <gseguin> yup
[13:44:41] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... and does it cost anything?
