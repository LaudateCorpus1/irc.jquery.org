[09:19:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2637 on jquery-mobile, reported by leopd (9h, 39m ago): Basic navigation broken on AJAX-loaded pages
[09:19:43] <johnbender> tempted to feed the troll
[09:19:47] <johnbender> but will not
[09:19:49] <johnbender> looking into it
[09:39:31] <kinblas> toddparker: johnbender: scottjehl: I just pushed the page event logger bookmarklet. You can find it here:  http://jquerymobile.com/test/tools/log-page-events.html
[09:45:19] <johnbender> kinblas: awesome
[09:45:23] <johnbender> question for you
[09:45:45] <johnbender> actually nevermind
[09:46:05] <kinblas> johnbender: sorry it took me a while to push that bookmarklet code
[09:46:16] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm looking at that duplication problem now
[09:47:32] <johnbender> kinblas: cool
[09:47:38] <johnbender> kinblas: actually I do have a question
[09:47:42] <kinblas> johnbender: scottjehl: so one problem with the bookmarklet, which I haven't been able to figure out .. .is that FireFox throws a document unknown error ... otherwise it works in all other browsers
[09:48:04] <kinblas> johnbender: ask away
[09:49:13] <johnbender> hmm
[09:49:16] <johnbender> still thinking
[09:49:20] <johnbender> sorry
[09:53:23] <johnbender> kinblas: if someone links to an embedded page `#mypage` at http://foo.com/foo.html, and nav doesn't find it, it goes off to request http://foo.com/foo.html#mypage which naturally results in the original page being loaded
[09:53:53] <johnbender> seems like we should throw an error there
[09:54:19] <kinblas> hmmm, yeah
[09:54:28] <kinblas> is that what is going on?
[09:54:37] <kinblas> with the tests that is
[09:54:40] * johnbender is a fan of failing with huge and firey explosions to suss out bugs
[09:54:47] <kinblas> lol
[09:54:55] <johnbender> kinblas: no this is related to a filed bug
[09:55:05] <johnbender> kinblas: http://jsbin.com/osigow/3
[09:55:13] <johnbender> kinblas: actually one second
[09:55:18] <kinblas> $(" body ").css("background-image", "url(thefinger.png)");
[09:55:26] <johnbender> kinblas: http://jsbin.com/osigow/4
[09:55:56] <johnbender> the second link pulls of the first page though its trying to load an embedded page that doesn't exist
[09:56:11] <johnbender> s/pulls of/pulls/
[09:56:12] <kinblas> oh is this that new bug someone just filed?
[09:56:19] <johnbender> yes
[09:56:25] <johnbender> he's not being very friendly
[09:56:43] <johnbender> so I've addressed the fact that he didn't read the documentation first but I don't think that's how the library should behave
[09:58:29] <johnbender> kinblas: as long as we're in agreement I'm happy to handle it
[09:59:35] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm confused
[09:59:38] <kinblas> the 2 urls you pasted above
[09:59:45] <kinblas> they refer to external pages
[09:59:49] <kinblas> not the same page
[10:00:26] <johnbender> kinblas: they're both jsbin eh?
[10:00:40] <kinblas> johnbender: aren't those examples from that bug where they claim pageinit isn't firing?
[10:01:19] * kinblas is still confused
[10:01:19] <johnbender> oh no
[10:01:22] <johnbender> different but

[10:01:31] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2637 on jquery-mobile, reported by leopd (10h, 20m ago): Basic navigation broken on AJAX-loaded pages
[10:01:43] <johnbender> dont respond though
[10:01:50] <johnbender> I've got one nearly finished
[10:02:01] <johnbender> just trying to make sure this is a bug before I respond and tell him what our fix will be
[10:02:27] <johnbender> he's expecting the ajax page to load two pages
[10:02:31] <johnbender> which it doesn't for good reason
[10:02:53] <kinblas> johnbender: hang on I'm trying to catch up
[10:02:54] <kinblas> :-)
[10:02:58] <kinblas> reading both bugs
[10:03:10] <johnbender> kk
[10:04:03] <kinblas> johnbender: ok so for 2637, referencing a 2nd page in an external document is not supported
[10:05:05] <johnbender> right
[10:05:06] <johnbender> clearly
[10:05:17] <kinblas> johnbender: the fact that the link in document 2 ("#page2) attempts to load the first doc is wrong, but I have an idea why that is happening
[10:05:26] <kinblas> it should actually attempt to load page2 again
[10:05:35] <kinblas> I meant document2
[10:06:06] <kinblas> but I put some code in place on clicks to assume id hashes are for original document because of a current bug in listview/dialog code
[10:06:17] <kinblas> perhaps its time to remove that and fix things
[10:07:02] <kinblas> johnbender: If I remember correctly the listview code was generating data-url that were based on the app document and not the document that actually contained the listview
[10:07:15] <kinblas> so in order to fix that I put in a temporary workaround
[10:07:27] <kinblas> which was the equivalent of what the original nav code used to do
[10:07:36] <kinblas> which was assume all id references were in the main document
[10:07:51] <kinblas> ... from the click handler that is .. .changePage() actually resolves things properly
[10:08:12] <kinblas> if you give it a #hash it resolves against the URL for the current active page
[10:08:15] <kinblas> not the document
[10:08:47] <kinblas> I think the more pressing problem to figure out is if 2636 is real or not
[10:08:53] <kinblas> it should be easy with the bookmarklet
[10:08:55] <kinblas> to prove
[10:09:58] <johnbender> kk
[10:10:39] <johnbender> ill respond and leave that one open
[10:12:24] <kinblas> johbender: oh ok so 2636 was user error
[10:12:24] <kinblas> he had duplicat ids
[10:12:26] <kinblas>  on his pages

[10:40:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: toddparker closed that one too
[10:40:29] <johnbender> its in the feature requests list
[12:04:21] <kinblas> johnbender: ping
[12:05:00] <kinblas> johnbender: I've been trying to repro the page duplication with: http://localhost/foo/bar/file.html#/foo/bar/file.html
[12:05:07] <kinblas> but I can't get it to duplicate?
[12:07:31] <kinblas> johnbender: maybe my test is to simplistic?
[12:07:34] <kinblas> I'm basically doing this:
[12:07:36] <kinblas> $( document ).bind("mobileinit", function(){
[12:07:36] <kinblas> 	$.mobile.pushStateEnabled = false;
[12:07:36] <kinblas> })
[12:07:36] <kinblas> ;
[12:07:36] <kinblas> $(function(){
[12:07:37] <kinblas> 	$( "#mybtn" ).click(function( e ){
[12:07:37] <kinblas> 		location.href = location.href.split('#')[0] + "#" + location.pathname;
[12:07:38] <kinblas> 		return false;
[12:07:38] <kinblas> 	});
[12:07:39] <kinblas> });
[12:07:50] <kinblas> which I think mimics what the unit test is doing
[12:08:20] <kinblas> it always finds the first page in the DOM and uses that, versus duplicating it
[12:12:41] <johnbender> kinblas: hmmm
[12:13:15] <johnbender> would it be helpful to create a branch with the tests commented out that I happened upon?
[12:13:46] <johnbender> it might have something to do with what the test setup is doing before navigateTestRoot is doing
[12:13:57] <johnbender> ugh
[12:14:13] <johnbender> s/navigateTestRoot is doing/navigateTestRoot is run/
[12:15:39] <johnbender> as and aside I don't think we can fix the popstate issue that I took over from you
[12:15:45] <johnbender> still thinking about it
[12:16:09] <johnbender> but I'm having a hard time coming up with anything that uniquely identifies the page as being loaded as a new doc vs going back to it
[12:20:35] <johnbender> kinblas: so one important thing I've noticed is that the offending messes with the global domCache value
[12:20:48] <johnbender> kinblas: "external page is cached in the DOM after pagehide when option is set globally"
[12:30:03] <kinblas> johnbender: regarding pushstate yeah, before your suggestion, I was at that point too. So the way I saw it was we either document the specific cases we know break, or disable it ... but it comes down to how often folks are going to encounter it ... are folks using data-ajax=false or rel=external to other jqm pages that often?
[12:30:15] * kinblas looks at the test johnbender points out
[12:41:28] <kinblas> johnbender: I'm confused. The test in question happens *AFTER* the navigateTestRoot, which I thought you said was the culprit.
[12:41:50] <kinblas> johnbender: I'll try adding domCache adjustments to see if that's what is causing the problem?
[12:41:53] <johnbender> kinblas: well it is the culprit on some level because that's whats adding the root page again
[12:42:09] <kinblas> johnbender: but it gets called first
[12:42:32] <kinblas> johnbender: can I just comment everything out, but that test to see the problem?
[12:42:39] <johnbender> kinblas: yes!
[12:42:43] <kinblas> or does it only happen if the test before it runs?
[12:42:57] <johnbender> kinblas: and it does get called first BUT the value is set before navigating away, so it may not be reaped etc etc
[12:43:17] <johnbender> kinblas: you can comment out everything except that test and the last one
[12:43:28] * kinblas gives it a go
[12:43:28] <johnbender> kinblas: "the value" being domCache
[12:43:42] <johnbender> still speculating here though, so that may be a red herring
[12:46:54] <kinblas> johnbender: do I have to do that ?push-state=false deal?
[12:47:00] <kinblas> because it's passing for me
[12:47:08] <kinblas> running just the 2 tests that is
[12:48:53] <johnbender> kinblas: yes
[12:51:10] <kinblas> johnbender: grr, it's passing. I cleared my cache and then ran it like this:
[12:51:13] <kinblas> http://localhost/jblas/jquery-mobile/tests/unit/navigation/?push-state=false
[12:51:25] <kinblas> that's what I need to do right?
[12:51:49] <johnbender> kinblas: indeed
[12:52:49] <johnbender> kinblas: let me push to a branch real quick
[12:52:58] <johnbender> on my personal repo

[12:55:03] <johnbender> yah
[12:55:15] <johnbender> kinblas: you can ignore the alert I have in my pushtate thats from debugging on device
[13:03:27] <johnbender> kinblas: any luck?
[13:04:01] <kinblas> strange I see it fail in your test
[13:04:08] <kinblas> the js directories are the same
[13:04:15] <kinblas> but the test directories aren't when I diff
[13:05:04] <kinblas> johnbender: I guess the difference is that you are still running the other navigation tests
[13:05:13] <kinblas> I had commented out the other js file includes
[13:08:17] <johnbender> kinblas: I took out the preceeding tests
[13:08:54] <johnbender> kinblas: https://github.com/johnbender/jquery-mobile/commit/e4e8ff24e3f4846fb7fe38a5120fa95e6bebaa6a#L1L20
[13:08:55] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by johnbender (14m, 51s ago): alterations to repro
[13:13:34] <kinblas> johnbender: AHA!
[13:13:38] <kinblas> it just dawned on me why
[13:14:01] <kinblas> note that this URL: /foo/bar/?blah=1
[13:14:03] <kinblas> is different from
[13:14:19] <kinblas> this one: /foo/bar/
[13:14:24] <kinblas> in this case it is
[13:14:41] <kinblas> this: /foo/bar/push-state=false
[13:14:54] <kinblas> but that particular utility function is setting to pathname
[13:15:18] <kinblas> so instead of /foo/bar/?push-state=false#/foo/bar?push-state=false
[13:15:20] <kinblas> we get
[13:15:50] <kinblas> this: /foo/bar/?push-state=false#/foo/bar/
[13:15:57] * kinblas tweaks the util function
[13:17:04] <johnbender> kinblas: or just remove it since the setup does it for you anyhow
[13:17:20] <johnbender> in my testing removing navigateToRoot solved the problem and had all the tests passing
[13:17:40] <johnbender> either way you're a genius
[13:17:45] * johnbender cheers for kinblas
[13:18:05] <kinblas> johnbender so I think we just need to modify that test to do
[13:18:11] <kinblas> location.pathname + location.search
[13:18:22] <kinblas> I meant that util func
[13:21:01] <johnbender> kinblas: navigateTestRoot?
[13:21:12] <johnbender> I had good results just removing it
[13:21:17] <johnbender> hrm
[13:21:23] <johnbender> actually nevermind
[13:21:32] <johnbender> there are instances of it floating around in the middle of tests
[13:22:10] <johnbender> kinblas: I think you're right though
[13:22:16] <johnbender> that should fix it
[13:22:27] * johnbender dreams of a day when the tests will run in true isolation 
[13:23:12] <kinblas> johnbender: I still don't get why my tree works
[13:23:19] <kinblas> I commented out exactly what you had
[13:23:26] <kinblas> the only difference ... I used c-style comments
[13:23:29] <kinblas> while you used C++
[13:23:44] <kinblas> I copy/pasted the URL I used and switched just the directory to your tree
[13:23:46] <kinblas> and it fails
[13:23:48] <kinblas> wtf?
[13:23:54] <kinblas> something's wierd
[13:23:59] <kinblas> and I'm in sync with the HEAD
[13:24:16] <kinblas> johnbender: anyways you got that fix? if so I'll just move on
[13:24:27] * kinblas is thankful to not get more bustage messages
[13:24:32] <johnbender> lol
[13:24:37] <johnbender> I think there's one more failure i might have to handle
[13:24:42] <johnbender> but I agree
[13:24:45] <johnbender> I'll handle it from here
[13:25:23] <kinblas> johnbender: okie dokie

[16:31:42] <johnbender> kinblas: for data-rel=dialog wouldn't we then have to alter the request to tell the root page to be rendered as a dialog?

[16:36:52] <kinblas> johnbender: so if they want to actually load an external document (without ajax) and have it render as a dialog
[16:37:02] <kinblas> then we have to modify our init loop
[16:37:12] <kinblas> to check for the case where the first div is data-role="dialog"
[16:37:16] <kinblas> we don't do that right now
[16:37:32] <kinblas> we lazily do it when the page is shown
[16:49:03] <johnbender> kinblas: ah! I'll add that tidbit
[16:49:38] <johnbender> kinblas: that would mean linking to dialogs though to eh?
[16:51:46] <kinblas> johnbender: not sure what you meant by the last thing
[16:52:40] <johnbender> I guess the "linking to dialogs" isn't a usability concern if its the root page
[16:52:43] <johnbender> disregard
