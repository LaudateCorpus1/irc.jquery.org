[07:01:46] <gseguin> good morning!
[07:19:29] <Wilto> Morning, guys.
[07:30:15] <toddmparker_> mornin
[07:30:41] <toddmparker_> reading up on AMD a bit this morning. good stuff
[07:30:59] <toddmparker_> so gseguin - where did we land re: almond?
[07:31:44] <gseguin> toddmparker_: after discussing with johnbender we decided to go the hacky way
[07:31:57] <gseguin> where we use AMD for dependency handling
[07:32:20] <gseguin> but get rid of the AMD wrappers in the built package
[07:32:29] <toddmparker_> i see
[07:32:41] <gseguin> that is in the amd branch
[07:32:45] <toddmparker_> gotcha
[07:32:58] <toddmparker_> so the almond branch is going away eventually?
[07:33:05] <gseguin> most likely
[07:33:20] <gseguin> although it's a more elegant solution
[07:33:25] <toddmparker_> so our stuff will be AMD compatible
[07:33:39] <toddmparker_> but the download builder will do the hacky stuff
[07:34:11] <gseguin> it sill in both case because we declare ourselves as an AMD module (that's kindda independent of the build step)
[07:34:22] <toddmparker_> right
[07:34:22] <gseguin> s/still/will/
[07:36:03] <toddmparker_> so is there still work to be done in that branch or is it pretty much done?
[07:37:29] <gseguin> yeah we need to extrac the hack out of r.js so we can update easily
[07:38:02] <gseguin> s/r.js/r-jqm.js/
[07:38:23] <gseguin> cause right now we have a private copy of r.js
[07:39:55] <gseguin> toddmparker_: Bender was worried about having a dependency on a third party project in our runtime
[07:40:10] <Wilto> I don’t blame him.
[07:40:14] <gseguin> that was one of the reason for going the hack way
[07:41:06] <gseguin> well we could make the shim ourselves but there is no reason to re-invent the wheel
[07:45:57] <toddmparker_> right
[07:46:52] <gseguin> almond.js costs 857 bytes once minified and gzipped
[09:16:43] <johnbender> kinblas: did you see my question for you on the branching basecamp thread?
[09:17:04] <kinblas> yeah but I couldn't reply lastnight on my phone
[09:17:11] <kinblas> so I meant it *SHOULD* land
[09:17:15] <johnbender> kinblas: cool
[09:17:25] <johnbender> going to merge and push now then
[09:17:34] <kinblas> ok sorry for the holdup
[09:17:41] <kinblas> still trying to slog through email
[09:17:50] <johnbender> kinblas: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YmMNpbFjp0
[09:17:59] <johnbender> kinblas: not at all, I posted it last night
[09:18:04] <kinblas> I'm also trying to understand kangax's test that scott posted
[09:18:14] <johnbender> and I figured you would be backlogged that's why I asked :D
[09:18:21] <johnbender> kinblas: link?
[09:18:56] <kinblas> http://www.engadget.com/photos/webos-framework-enyo-eyes-on/#3865854
[09:19:02] <kinblas> whoops
[09:19:04] <kinblas> wrong paste
[09:19:05] <kinblas> :-)
[09:19:18] <johnbender> kinblas: I see you got my other email :D
[09:19:22] <kinblas> https://gist.github.com/1470996
[09:19:25] <kinblas> heh yeah
[09:19:40] <kinblas> johnbender: so what did you mean take a look at it?
[09:36:38] <Wilto> Hey, you guys wanna hit this link with some gadgets with flaky position: fixed support? http://filamentgroup.com/tests/fixedtest/
[09:45:38] <johnbender> Wilto: I will give me a minute
[09:45:44] <johnbender> Wilto: is toddmparker_ around?
[09:45:48] <johnbender> gseguin: are you lurking?
[09:46:09] <Wilto> In a meeting, on and off.
[09:46:10] <Wilto> Need something relayed?
[09:46:17] <johnbender> not really
[09:46:20] <gseguin> I was hitting Wilto's test page with all my devices
[09:46:20] <johnbender> actually nevermind
[09:46:38] <johnbender> I'll explain in the branch thread after I push the changes to stable
[09:47:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to 1.0-stable: http://git.io/GQMozQ
[09:47:34] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.0-stable] Merge branch 'master' into 1.0-stable - John Bender
[09:53:11] <eddiemonge> wont that change the scoll position if they are scrolled to somewhere else on the page?
[09:53:38] <Wilto> Yep.
[09:53:57] <eddiemonge> shouldnt it store where the page is scrolled to and then revert to that after done?
[09:56:05] <Wilto> Prolly.
[09:56:11] <Wilto> We can tune that stuff later, though, if this works out.
[09:58:32] <johnbender> gseguin: I updated the branch thread with what i was bothering you guys about
[10:22:57] <toddmparker_> johnbender: thanks, looks good
[11:34:17] <kinblas> Wilto: damn, even the tests you guys make are pretty
[11:34:25] <kinblas> Wilto: I just hit it with some of my devices
[11:34:34] <Wilto> Hah, all Scott, that.
[11:34:47] <Wilto> We’re kind of in flux again—I should’ve said something. False positive on Android 2.1.
[11:37:34] <Wilto> False negative in IE7 too, buuuut we’re all kinda more okay with that.
[11:37:45] <Wilto> As they’d just get static behavior.
[11:39:28] <Wilto> But hopefully that’ll work out too.
[11:45:32] <kinblas> Wilto: ok, done, just hit it with everything I had on me
[11:45:40] <Wilto> Sweet.
[11:45:46] <gseguin> Wilto: same here
[11:45:53] <Wilto> How we lookin’, gents?
[11:46:13] <kinblas> Wilto: I'm still good lookin' as usual.
[11:46:20] <Wilto> ?os
[11:46:21] <bot-t> oh snao™
[11:46:40] <Wilto> These results are pretty reassuring.
[11:47:10] <Wilto> I can’t recall the state of position: fixed on WinPhone 7/7.5—is it normally flaky?
[11:48:03] <toddmparker_> nah. WP is inline all the way
[11:48:16] <toddmparker_> BB6 is flaky like A2.1
[11:48:26] <toddmparker_> so those are two I want to toss to the curb
[11:48:31] <Wilto> “Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; U; Android 2.1-update1; en-us; DROIDX Build/VZW) AppleWebKit/530.17 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/4.0 Mobile Safari/530.17 480X854 motorola DROIDX”
[11:48:37] <Wilto> How the hell do people use UAs for things.
[11:48:45] <toddmparker_> seriously
[13:55:30] <toddmparker_> kinblas: great you got a reply
[13:56:02] <kinblas> yeah, but it wasn't much info
[13:56:37] <kinblas> if they've already addressed this in ICS I doubt they're going to want to spend much time guiding us on how to fix or workaround older versions
[13:56:50] <kinblas> toddmparker_: Do you guys have an ICS device?
[13:56:58] <toddmparker_> nope
[13:57:02] <toddmparker_> wish i did
[13:58:08] <kinblas> toddmparker_: what's interesting is that he made it sound like 2d transforms were not composited in earlier versions ... we'll have to confirm that by switching to translate3d
[13:58:40] <kinblas> I tried that for Honeycomb 3.2 and it made no difference, but I think 3.0 was the first debut of GPU support
[13:58:58] <kinblas> I didn't try it on older android
[13:59:36] <kinblas> toddmparker_: in any case we can't just transform everything in ICS since it sounds like that would bloat just like iOS
[14:02:36] <Wilto> Right. So.
[14:02:42] <Wilto> Such news have I, of position: fixed;
[14:03:31] <Wilto> Good news: the test Scott and I have been working on today works!
[14:03:44] <Wilto> The bad news is that it works in browsers where position: fixed kind of does not.
[14:03:46] <kinblas> Wilto: no flashing ?
[14:03:55] <kinblas> Wilto: heh
[14:04:07] <Wilto> Thing is, all the associated values are correct.
[14:04:28] <Wilto> As far as the browser knows, everything’s in the right place. It’s just that, in a lot of places, they VISUALLY snap into place post-scroll.
[14:04:35] <Wilto> And on Android 2.1, that snap doesn’t always happen.
[14:04:37] <kinblas> Wilto: btw, those tests are missing Opera MObile and Opera Mini btw
[14:04:42] <Wilto> It’s a rendering issue.
[14:04:51] <Wilto> Yeah, haven’t dug into that part. No specific omissions in there yet.
[14:05:05] <johnbender> I thought that was the reason why position fixed wouldn't work in the first place because of the way browsers snapshot, scroll, reflow
[14:05:13] <kinblas> heh
[14:05:20] <kinblas> but now they can't blame us
[14:05:27] <johnbender> hahah
[14:05:31] <Wilto> Yep.
[14:05:32] <johnbender> fair enough
[14:05:42] <Wilto> I was just thinking, there has to be some inconsistency somewhere.
[14:05:46] <Wilto> There is not.
[14:06:02] <Wilto> I’d be fine with the snapping. It’s just that it doesn’t happen like 1/3 of the time on Android 2.1.
[14:06:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: you around?
[14:06:51] <toddmparker_>  yep johnbender
[14:07:06] <Wilto> Bottom line: all mobile devices are stupid forever.
[14:07:08] <Wilto> ?cc
[14:07:08] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[14:07:12] <toddmparker_> kinblas: i'll test opera mobile, ff mobile on android 2.3
[14:07:13] <johnbender> toddmparker_: any thoughts on sergey's zip file?
[14:07:29] <johnbender> as in, it's a zip file?
[14:07:34] <johnbender> is he around?
[14:07:37] <johnbender> sergey?
[14:07:54] <toddmparker_> haven't looked at it
[14:08:05] <toddmparker_> seems like it should be a branch, right?
[14:08:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: well or anything to do with source control :/
[14:08:52] <toddmparker_> heh
[14:09:01] <johnbender> I'd settle for a patch file
[14:09:06] <Wilto> Gotta burn those suckers on CDs and mail ’em around.
[14:09:20] <toddmparker_> actually, was that a BC message? or email
[14:09:21] <johnbender> ^
[14:09:26] <johnbender> basecamp
[14:09:33] <johnbender> I responded
[14:09:45] <toddmparker_> k, thanks
[14:09:59] <toddmparker_> think he might need a tour from you bender on the procedures
[14:10:24] <Wilto> johnbender: see ?flip
[14:10:24] <bot-t> johnbender, (╯‵Д′)╯彡┻━┻
[14:10:52] <toddmparker_> still don't see that
[14:11:12] <kinblas> yeah it would be better in git as a pull request so we can comment back and forth
[14:11:21] <kinblas> he just sent the 1.0 all-in-one js file
[14:11:26] <kinblas> modified and un-modified
[14:11:30] <kinblas> so we'd have to hand-patch
[14:11:31] <kinblas> to test
[14:12:52] <toddmparker_> bah
[14:13:02] <toddmparker_> so opera mobile fails the test -yay
[14:13:09] <toddmparker_> opera mini claims it supports this
[14:13:14] <toddmparker_> and messes it up
[14:13:19] <kinblas> heh
[14:13:24] <Wilto> everything is the worst
[14:13:37] <toddmparker_> so we need to exclude opera mini, A2.1, FF mobile
[14:13:42] <toddmparker_> they all busted
[14:13:52] <toddmparker_> BB6 is kinda bad too, but not broken
[14:14:00] <toddmparker_> (toolbars snap back in)
[14:18:11] <toddmparker_> miketaylr: you on teh internets
[14:18:26] <miketaylr> toddmparker_: yo
[14:18:27] <miketaylr> i am
[14:18:37] <toddmparker_> yo, got a question for ya
[14:18:43] <miketaylr> which test are we failing?
[14:18:52] <toddmparker_> heh, wel...
[14:18:58] <toddmparker_> we're doing a lot of testing on position:fixed support
[14:19:04] <Wilto> FIX IT
[14:19:08] <miketaylr> haha
[14:19:16] <toddmparker_> we have a support test which mobile fails nicely
[14:19:17] <miketaylr> i reported some bug from brad frost's blag post a while back
[14:19:26] <toddmparker_> but Mini thinks it's all cool
[14:19:45] <toddmparker_> but then wets it's pants and runs home when you throw :fixed at it
[14:19:46] <miketaylr> false positive?
[14:19:53] <miketaylr> lol
[14:20:07] <Wilto> Metaphor++
[14:20:18] <toddmparker_> http://filamentgroup.com/tests/fixedtest/
[14:20:40] <Wilto> Yeah. getBoundingClientRect().top, offsetTop, etc.—all reporting correctly.
[14:20:52] <miketaylr> oooo pretty
[14:20:53] <toddmparker_> 2nd from the bottom = mini on Android
[14:21:00] <toddmparker_> can see it here: http://wil.to/fixed/
[14:21:17] <toddmparker_> it just throws the footer *somewhere*
[14:21:27] <miketaylr> did nobody test with mobile 11.5?
[14:21:30] <miketaylr> i only see 11.1
[14:21:32] <miketaylr> i can test
[14:21:36] <toddmparker_> kk
[14:21:38] <Wilto> Awesome.
[14:21:49] <miketaylr> wheres mah damn phone
[14:21:50] <miketaylr> brb
[14:22:00] <toddmparker_> quick, I'll call you
[14:22:04] <Wilto> Gotta assume that Mini users keep to a pretty decent update schedule, yeah?
[14:23:04] <miketaylr> yeah, and any kind of core issue gets fixed on the server side anyways
[14:23:18] <miketaylr> mini updates are more like, check out this cool new UI thingy that shows you how much bandwidth you save now
[14:23:20] <toddmparker_> riiiight. nice
[14:23:44] <toddmparker_> so you can retroactively revoke mini's ability to play with :fixed and matches?
[14:23:56] <Wilto> Yeah, throw some knife switches over there.
[14:23:58] <Wilto> Make it so.
[14:24:02] <miketaylr> heh
[14:24:13] <toddmparker_> miketaylr: is 6.5.1 the latest opera mini hotness for iOS?
[14:24:43] <miketaylr> i believe so
[14:24:56] <toddmparker_> that passes the test, lemme see if it actually works
[14:25:08] <miketaylr> bless your heart for having a tiny URL for this test
[14:25:28] <miketaylr> ok lemme screenshot this test result
[14:25:40] <toddmparker_> np
[14:25:48] <toddmparker_> boo...6.5 is busted
[14:26:03] <Wilto> wil.to: for all your testing and animated gif need.
[14:26:05] <toddmparker_> opera mini is so grounded for this
[14:26:18] <Wilto> s/\./s\.
[14:26:29] <Wilto> I’m not good at regex.
[14:26:31] <Wilto> Anyway.
[14:26:51] <miketaylr> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5821876/tmp/opera%20mobile%2011.5%20android.png
[14:27:01] <Wilto> BROKEN
[14:27:02] <miketaylr> GOOD LUCK TYPING THAT ON YOUR PHONE
[14:27:04] <toddmparker_> you should ask kin for a URL. it's like war and peace
[14:27:14] <miketaylr> stupid dropbox
[14:27:41] <toddmparker_> you've been hacked
[14:27:43] <Wilto> Everyone: http://shauninman.com/archive/2009/08/17/less_n
[14:27:53] <Wilto> Open source URL shorteners for all.
[14:28:09] <miketaylr> ok try again http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5821876/tmp/opera%20mobile%2011.5%20android.png
[14:28:59] <Wilto> Then it starts wilin’ out once you scroll.
[14:29:16] <miketaylr> Opera/9.80 (Android 2.3.5; Linux; Opera Mobi/ADR-1111101157; U; en) Presto/2.9.201 Version/11.50
[14:29:22] <toddmparker_> hmm
[14:29:25] <miketaylr> nobody said nuthin about scrolling
[14:29:27] <toddmparker_> so it's fixed in latest?
[14:29:28] <miketaylr> lemme do that
[14:29:53] <miketaylr> when you scroll, it kinda snaps into place after the scroll
[14:30:00] <Wilto> …Oh?
[14:30:01] <toddmparker_> well, that's workable
[14:30:19] <toddmparker_> older versions ore broke
[14:30:26] <miketaylr> i mean, it's not like i've got some sekrit version... go download 11.5 and verify Wilto :D
[14:30:30] <miketaylr> you know you love android
[14:30:39] <Wilto> i don’t i do not i hate it
[14:30:44] <Wilto> And it hates me.
[14:30:46] <miketaylr> love love love
[14:30:57] <miketaylr> ok let me test mini
[14:31:07] <toddmparker_> updating
[14:31:31] <toddmparker_> 10m downloads
[14:31:35] <toddmparker_> not too shabby
[14:31:45] <toddmparker_> so how do we target this?
[14:32:25] <toddmparker_> or do we just nuke all versions of mini and have these fall back to inline
[14:32:45] <miketaylr> hmm i should find the hourly build of mini to see if it's better
[14:33:28] <toddmparker_> wait, miketaylr are you talking about mobile or mini on Android?
[14:33:45] <toddmparker_> i just updated to the latest mini and it's 6.5.27452
[14:33:46] <miketaylr> sorry. the test i just did was the android market 11.5 version
[14:33:59] <toddmparker_> mine was from the market too
[14:34:01] <miketaylr> i'm saying i want to grab an internal version of mini and try the test
[14:34:08] <miketaylr> 11.5 == mobile
[14:34:13] <miketaylr> (sry, way confusing)
[14:34:17] <toddmparker_> ooooh
[14:34:31] <toddmparker_> so mini is the issue
[14:34:40] <toddmparker_> the footer is just hanging out randomly
[14:34:51] <toddmparker_> mobile fails our test so that's ok
[14:34:58] <toddmparker_> and 11.5 might pass and work
[14:35:06] <Wilto> Hang on, think I just broke the short URL test.
[14:35:09] <miketaylr> (passed for me)
[14:35:27] <toddmparker_> ...in 11.5
[14:35:29] <toddmparker_> ?
[14:35:31] <miketaylr> yes
[14:35:47] <toddmparker_> good. fails in 11, passes in 11.5 seems good
[14:36:21] <toddmparker_> updating to 11.5 now
[14:36:37] <Wilto> Test is fixed.
[14:36:41] <miketaylr> now mini, that's tougher. not sure how it should work as an OBML image
[14:36:58] <miketaylr> ok, so with the fixed test on mini
[14:37:02] <miketaylr> works fine on load
[14:37:14] <miketaylr> doesn't react on scroll (which i would expect)
[14:37:25] <miketaylr> (and no other human being would)
[14:37:26] <Wilto> “OBML image.”
[14:37:35] <Wilto> I WOULD EXPECT IT.
[14:37:47] <Wilto> But I’m cool with that, as long as it isn’t wholesale busted.
[14:37:57] <toddmparker_> just wish mini ignored :fixed like good little browser
[14:38:01] <miketaylr> binary markup is the latest rage
[14:38:14] <toddmparker_> 01110101110010011
[14:38:22] <toddmparker_> (totally)
[14:38:22] <miketaylr> mmm semantics
[14:38:23] <Wilto> Leave my mother out of this, Todd.
[14:38:34] <toddmparker_> oops
[14:38:37] <Wilto> …What? You guys can’t read that?
[14:38:39] <toddmparker_> missed a 0
[14:39:12] <miketaylr> what would you guys recommend for mini?
[14:39:26] <miketaylr> i can pass it along to the mini server folks
[14:39:35] <toddmparker_> just ignore those rules and fall back to inline flow
[14:39:45] <Wilto> Yeah, that’s kind of livin’ the dream with this fixed stuff.
[14:39:48] <toddmparker_> if you can't re-paint on scroll, it will alwasy be busted
[14:39:53] <Wilto> Either FIXED-fixed, or just make it inline.
[14:40:30] <toddmparker_> falling back to inline is cool with us. it's these 'tweeners who attempt it and leave their fixed elements marooned all over the page
[14:40:41] <Wilto> By “inline” I mean “static.”
[14:40:45] <toddmparker_> ya
[14:41:13] <toddmparker_> seems like a good rule for mini across the board. would probably un-break a lot of sites
[14:41:18] <miketaylr> imma search and try to find any mini/fixed bugs
[14:41:48] <Wilto> You are a gentleman and a scholar.
[14:42:02] <miketaylr> hmm so http://filamentgroup.com/tests/fixedtest/ shows false for 11.50
[14:42:06] <miketaylr> on the bottom onw
[14:42:09] <miketaylr> s/onw/now/
[14:42:40] <Wilto> wat
[14:43:03] <Wilto> Oh. Android vs. iPhone.
[14:43:08] <Wilto> oh my head
[14:43:17] <miketaylr> are these results automatic?
[14:43:30] <Wilto> Yeah. Just grabs the UA.
[14:43:45] <Wilto> Opera/9.80 (iPhone;… is true.
[14:43:56] <Wilto> Opera/9.80 (Android 2.3.4… is false.
[14:44:08] <miketaylr> hmm
[14:44:10] <miketaylr> that seems... wrong
[14:44:16] <miketaylr> what do i know
[14:44:40] <Wilto> “I just work here” wokka wokka.
[14:44:54] <miketaylr> (based on my visual testing, but i don't even know what's getting done in the background)
[14:45:07] <miketaylr> oh, i'll try on my tablet thinger too
[14:45:59] <Wilto> WELP.
[14:46:04] <Wilto> I am going to go drink.
[14:46:13] <Wilto> Because I spent all day with Android 2.1 and position: fixed.
[14:46:59] <miketaylr> absynthe is on me
[14:47:02] <Wilto> Pick this up tomorrow, gents. miketaylr: as always, your support is greatly appreciated.
[14:47:18] <Wilto> A couple swigs of that and I’ll see all sorts of elements moving around on scroll. Even ones that aren’t there.
[14:47:28] <miketaylr> heh, the appreciated bearer of bugs
[14:47:32] <miketaylr> or something
[14:47:40] <Wilto> It’s a dirty job, but etc. etc.
[14:47:42] <Wilto> Later, guys.
[14:47:46] <miketaylr> pzz
[14:47:59] <toddmparker_> so if you refresh, my opera mobile 11.5/Android 2.3 fails the test
[14:48:36] <toddmparker_> so 11.1 and 11.5 both fail the test
[14:48:46] <miketaylr> weird
[14:48:51] <miketaylr> what qualifies for passing?
[14:49:11] <toddmparker_> you'd need to check the code
[14:49:16] <miketaylr> :)
[14:49:20] <toddmparker_> tho this does the snap backto place thing
[14:49:26] <toddmparker_> might be better if it fails, no?
[14:49:38] <toddmparker_> scott and mat wrote it, sorry
[14:49:50] <miketaylr> oh either way, if it's busted let's get it fixed
[14:50:01] <miketaylr> just seemed to pass visually on mine, so i'm confused
[14:50:06] <toddmparker_> yeah, i think getting real fixed support would be great
[14:50:22] <toddmparker_> currently, it re-positions the toolbars after scroll stop
[14:50:26] <miketaylr> yeah
[14:50:27] <toddmparker_> which looks bad
[14:50:32] <miketaylr> very jumpy
[14:50:33] <toddmparker_> this si all on latest mobile
[14:50:43] <toddmparker_> looks like out current JS fixed toolbars
[14:50:54] <toddmparker_> which are bad news bears
[14:50:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: question for you if you have a minute to spare from your position: fixed chicanery
[14:51:08] <toddmparker_> k, but i gotta jet in a minute johnbender
[14:51:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1259
[14:51:11] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1259 on jquery-mobile, reported by narimanh (8m, 3w ago): class="ui-bar" runs off screen on iPhone 4
[14:51:20] <johnbender> we recommend the use of `ui-bar` for padding
[14:51:24] <johnbender> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/toolbars/docs-footers.html
[14:51:33] <johnbender> that's why they are using it and getting the overflow
[14:51:45] <toddmparker_> ah
[14:51:49] <johnbender> we didn't see it before because we were overflow hidden
[14:51:59] <toddmparker_> i need to check with scott on that one
[14:51:59] <toddmparker_> we should not recommend that
[14:52:05] <johnbender> :D
[14:52:11] <johnbender> I'm going to make a note in the issue then
[14:52:17] <toddmparker_> math doesn't work
[14:52:20] <toddmparker_> ok, gotta head out
[14:52:34] <toddmparker_> but miketaylr or johnbender - feel free to hit me tomorrow
[14:52:44] <miketaylr> :)~
[14:52:45] <miketaylr> cya
[14:53:19] <johnbender> kk
[15:09:13] <johnbender> kinblas: you around
[15:09:14] <johnbender> ?
[15:09:25] <kinblas> johnbender: nope
[15:09:31] <johnbender> kinblas: fair enough
[15:09:34] <kinblas> :-P
[15:09:35] <kinblas> :-)
[15:09:38] <kinblas> Whassup?
[15:09:54] <johnbender> kinblas: I think i've already asked you this question so sorry for that in advance
[15:10:22] <johnbender> kinblas: are we only allowing cross domain page loads for phonegap?
[15:10:28] <kinblas> oh yeah
[15:10:30] <johnbender> more specifically for the file protocol?
[15:10:35] <kinblas> right
[15:10:45] <kinblas> that was a CYA move on our part
[15:10:45] <johnbender> right === yes?
[15:11:00] <kinblas> because we don't want any XSS script modifying the location.hash
[15:11:07] <kinblas> and causing us to go to badguys.com
[15:11:19] <johnbender> ah! thats right because we innerHTML the pages
[15:11:25] <johnbender> sigh
[15:11:26] <kinblas> yes we only allow loading of cross-domain pages when going from file:// to http://
[15:11:28] <johnbender> so obvious
[15:11:40] <johnbender> thank you!
[15:11:40] <kinblas> and only when that flag is set
[15:11:50] <kinblas> sorry I saw that query
[15:11:52] <kinblas> and meant to reply
[15:11:57] <kinblas> thanks for reminding/pinging
[15:12:01] <johnbender> np np I know you're busy
[15:12:10] <johnbender> and I don't mind pestering people :P
[15:12:43] <kinblas> I don't mind
[15:13:03] <kinblas> I need the nudge too, I suffer from "oh I'll answer that in a bit" and I get sidetracked
[15:19:15] <miketaylr> ok toddmparker_ and Wilto (even tho you're both away) just filed bug on jumpy fix:pos
[15:24:36] <johnbender> kinblas: follow up question. I don't know much about cors but I was under the impression that no browser (aside from phonegap's WebViews) would allow xdomain without a CORS setup
[15:24:49] <johnbender> wait
[15:24:51] <johnbender> don't answer that
[15:25:22] <johnbender> nevermind
[15:25:42] <kinblas> most modern browsers turn CORS on when they recieve the HTTP instruction for it from the server
[15:26:04] <kinblas> that was the source of our XSS problem
[15:26:13] <johnbender> kk
[15:26:18] <johnbender> its a server side control
[15:26:20] <kinblas> since most folks are using modern browsers (on mobile)
[15:26:23] <kinblas> and server controls it
[15:26:24] <kinblas> yeah
[15:26:36] * johnbender sighs again
[15:26:44] <johnbender> sorry
[16:30:26] <johnbender> kinblas: did you ever add any tests for the cross domain links?
[16:30:56] <johnbender> kinblas: having it in two places means i'm centralizing it
[16:31:04] <johnbender> but I don't want to break nuthin
[16:31:17] <kinblas> johnbender: I don't think I did, but mainly because it required a file:// to load the original document
[16:31:33] <johnbender> kinblas: hmm thats right
[16:32:49] <kinblas> johnbender: I suppose we can fake it out by manually changing $.mobile.documentPath and $.mobile.documentBase
[16:34:40] <johnbender> kinblas: I can at least test my helper method so long as I can manipulate the documentUrl
[16:34:54] <johnbender> which it appears I can by stubing a path object method
[16:35:04] <kinblas> ya mon
