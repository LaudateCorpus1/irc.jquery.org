[02:49:06] <_|Nix|_> ?tell johnbender Strange thing about http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/229/consoleFull is that http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery-mobile/da342b148a54441893ef13e503c69804f1de5ef1/js/jquery.hashchange.js does not contain references to $.mobile.msie ... so, either the line number is reported wrong, or something even weirder is going on.
[02:49:07] <bot-t1> _|Nix|_, Okay.

[05:22:41] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: pong!
[06:53:11] <gseguin> Good morning
[07:02:18] <arschmitz> good morning gseguin
[07:09:52] * zachleat is looking into the bug with swipe to close
[07:13:08] <Wilto> Welp. I use Irssi now.
[07:13:21] <Wilto> Soon Iâ€™m gonna have opinions about Ubuntus.
[07:16:39] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: I have a question abou a piece of logic in popup when your around
[07:17:07] <uGoMobi> hey all
[08:05:37] <gseguin> Wilto: didn't like Weechat?

[08:22:13] <arschmitz> zachleat: im going to make those changes ^^
[08:22:26] <zachleat> Great, thanks!
[08:22:30] <arschmitz> zachleat: there is a conflic somewhere so i cant just merge
[08:22:46] <arschmitz> this will fix some ios6 issues we saw this weekend too
[08:23:01] <arschmitz> im also hoping it will fix an android issue we found
[08:23:01] <zachleat> awesome
[08:23:20] <zachleat> I got a little trigger happy when removing that css, my bad.
[08:23:37] <arschmitz> zachleat: its all good
[08:30:24] <uGoMobi> zachleat: do we really need to add class pageChildAnimations: "ui-page-panel-animate"? It's not used in the CSS
[08:31:07] <zachleat> not sure, I didn't write this code just the tests for it :)
[08:31:12] <zachleat> I'll check though
[08:31:36] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: iv noticed some unused varibles and stuff too from all the refactoring
[08:31:45] <uGoMobi> we add it to the page

[08:32:15] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so if its not in css id just make sure its not used for some sort of tracking of an element or something in the js 
[08:32:32] <zachleat> It's just added and removed, not ever checked
[08:32:46] <zachleat> uGoMobi: I think you're right
[08:33:00] <zachleat> Good catch
[08:33:00] <arschmitz> zachleat: uGoMobi: its probably a left over from an old version of panels
[08:33:20] <uGoMobi> yeah I understand
[08:33:32] <uGoMobi> you guys did a lot of refactoring
[08:33:38] <zachleat> arschmitz: I can remove it and add that to the PR if you'd like
[08:33:53] <arschmitz> zachleat: its fine ill do it right now
[08:34:04] <zachleat> ok thanks
[08:34:05] <arschmitz> i cant merge the PR anyway because it has conflicts
[08:34:30] <arschmitz> so since its like 3 lines im just making the change and refrencing the pr in the commit

[08:37:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no problem
[08:37:39] <uGoMobi> ok thanks
[08:46:40] <gseguin> oh wow api.jquery.com is live
[08:46:46] <gseguin> when did that happen?
[08:46:54] <arschmitz> gseguin i think it was just this mornign
[08:47:06] <arschmitz> i dont think it was yesterday but i noticed at 5:30 this morning it was
[08:47:42] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15arschmitz pushed 1 new commit to 06master: 02http://git.io/DR3byA

[08:48:14] <gseguin> way cool, I guess UI and mobile are right around the corner, right?
[08:48:29] <arschmitz> ui has been since october 
[08:49:03] <arschmitz> gseguin: we are launching with 1.3 is the plan still i think
[08:49:38] <uGoMobi> new jQuery site was live yesterday
[08:50:06] <gseguin> doh! yeah sorry
[08:50:08] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: cool i didnt notice yesterday maybe i didnt actually look ha ha 
[08:50:19] <uGoMobi> still old JQM logo on it :(
[08:50:37] <arschmitz> i saw something from johnbender about the logo
[08:50:41] <uGoMobi> but... the site looks good!
[08:52:30] <arschmitz> for sure
[08:52:59] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: logo will be replaced when new-css goes live, no preview yet though. 
[08:53:25] <jzaefferer> you could check out https://github.com/jquery/web-base-template/tree/new-css
[08:53:26] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: awesome
[08:54:29] <arschmitz> jzaefferer:looks really good already
[08:55:00] <jzaefferer> I wonder how well jQuery Mobile handles dependencies these days. I'd like to use the CSS framework and probably a few low-level components, but hardly any widgets or the ajax navigation. Any well known pain points?
[08:55:29] <jzaefferer> Working on a mobile prototype where I need to cut a lot of corners, but figuring out which ones to cut is difficult
[08:56:12] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: that should work fine with a custom build
[08:59:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no luck on zachleat's changes fixing android webview or browserstack  :( i was really hoping 
[08:59:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: hmm :(
[08:59:32] <jzaefferer> arschmitz: just use download builder?
[08:59:45] <arschmitz> jzaefferer: yup
[08:59:48] <zachleat> what're these? do you have a link to the issue? I can take a look
[09:00:39] <arschmitz> zachleat: basicly in a webview or on browserstack on android 4.0 and 4.1 panels are 100% broken cant open them at all with out setting data-position-fixed="false"
[09:00:59] <arschmitz> but real devices not in a webview are fine
[09:01:30] <arschmitz> zachleat: i think its a timing issue but im not sure
[09:01:48] <uGoMobi> zachleat: it's described in the comments here https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5163
[09:01:56] <zachleat> thanks
[09:02:13] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, I was thinking in same direction
[09:02:36] <uGoMobi> like i said when I found out the FFissue was a timing issue
[09:02:53] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah thats why i was hoping it would fix android too 
[09:03:03] <uGoMobi> it could explain the redraws
[09:03:27] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yup
[09:04:22] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: it to me almost seemed like the manipulation done in the main part of open wasent done yet when complete is fired
[09:05:12] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yes exactly
[09:05:53] <arschmitz> i was thinking about throwing a deffered in there to make sure the transition is done AND the main part of the func is done before firing complete
[09:06:05] <arschmitz> see if that makes a difference
[09:06:09] <jqmobilecommit> [13jquery-mobile] 15lisotton-cit opened issue #5425: Reopen of #5423 - Body with background-image crash IE8  02http://git.io/hkSi-w
[09:06:50] <uGoMobi> pfff ^^
[09:07:02] <arschmitz> yeah i was just looking at it 
[09:08:30] <uGoMobi> custom style before script does crash IE8
[09:10:16] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: weird
[09:10:23] <uGoMobi> but my oppinion is... won't fix
[09:10:46] <uGoMobi> just don't put style tage before script tag... case closed :)
[09:10:54] <uGoMobi> tag*
[09:11:00] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah i hate ie8 any way lol
[09:27:48] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: we are wrong about timing and android
[09:28:14] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: tell me
[09:28:23] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: added a deffered to ensure 100% everything is done before calling complete and it does not make any difference
[09:28:33] <uGoMobi_> hmm
[09:29:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: need to set some alerts and see what exactly is going on timing wise i think
[09:29:27] <uGoMobi_> yeah that's how I debugged FF
[09:30:00] <uGoMobi_> and I still think it's a perfomance issue
[09:30:17] <uGoMobi_> because browserstack is worse than actual device
[09:30:37] <uGoMobi_> and stock browser is worse than Chrome on Android 4.1 device
[09:32:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i agree thats what i was saying to toddmparker_: that i thought browserstack and webivew were the same because they are both slow
[09:32:55] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: did you test without fixed header?
[09:33:06] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: no
[09:33:47] <uGoMobi_> when I test http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/panels/index.html on Android 4.1 stock browser and scroll down a bit... it looks good
[09:35:00] <uGoMobi_> but that is because the header is hidden when panel opens
[09:35:30] <uGoMobi_> we have this logic for switching position fixed / absolute for fixed headers
[09:36:25] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm so events are fireing in the right order and they are all fireing 
[09:48:24] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: where are you looking?
[09:48:24] <bot-t1> (6 hours 59 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender Strange thing about http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/229/consoleFull is that http://swarm.jquery.org/git/jquery-mobile/da342b148a54441893ef13e503c69804f1de5ef1/js/jquery.hashchange.js does not contain references to $.mobile.msie ... so, either the line number is reported wrong, or something even weirder is going on.

[09:48:24] <bot-t1> (6 hours 56 mins ago) <_|Nix|_> tell johnbender $ 
[09:49:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so it looks like your on to something
[09:49:12] <arschmitz> setting the header to be not position fixed also works
[09:49:30] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so header fixed panel not works
[09:49:36] <Wilto> What are the haps today, all?
[09:49:45] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: header not fixed panel fixed works
[09:50:13] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: header fixed and panel fixed = busted
[09:50:24] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: yes
[09:50:31] <uGoMobi_> that's what I see too
[09:50:49] <uGoMobi_> looking at fixedToolbar CSS now
[09:51:16] <arschmitz> based on the shadow i see on browserstack it looks like its not updating the panel position its still off the left hand side of the screen
[09:53:38] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: if I remove the CSS that was added to fixedToolbar.css so we keep the fixed header in view it works way better too
[09:54:17] <uGoMobi_> so it looks like the the transform3d for the header at the same time is just too much
[09:54:20] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: dunno, appears to be working on a rebuild
[09:54:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: hmm maybe this isnt a timeing issue after all
[09:55:10] <arschmitz> though still very strange its only where things run really slow
[09:56:11] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: got something else
[09:56:21] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: do tell?
[09:57:13] <uGoMobi_> that transform3d transition for hiding the fixed header does not only apply if the browser passes the transform3d test
[09:57:32] <uGoMobi_> we don't use class .ui-panel-3dtransforms
[09:57:54] <arschmitz> hmm but this is an issue on browsers that do pass lol
[09:58:43] <uGoMobi_> yeah, it's just something else we have to check
[10:04:46] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: when I move the fixed header together with content (translateX(-17em)) it looks way better
[10:05:03] <arschmitz> cool
[10:05:07] <uGoMobi_> have to check why has been decided to hide the fixed header when panel opens
[10:05:18] <arschmitz> have you tried in a webview to see if it helps?
[10:05:28] <uGoMobi_> maybe because of issues on other platforms/browsers
[10:05:47] <uGoMobi_> gonna test webview now
[10:07:42] <uGoMobi_> hmm i get error in that webview app now ... internet connection required 
[10:07:47] <uGoMobi_> wifi is working fine
[10:08:02] <arschmitz> i had that happen a few times had to restart the app
[10:08:58] <doesallmagic> Yippie, build fixed!
[10:08:59] <doesallmagic> Project jQuery Mobile Phantom Master jQuery Git build #230: FIXED in 15 min: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/230/
[10:09:01] <uGoMobi_> nevermind... caused by typo in url
[10:09:47] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: doesn't work on webview... fixed header doesn't move at all
[10:10:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi:damn
[10:10:16] <uGoMobi_> conclusion: translateX() not working on element with position fixed
[10:10:29] <uGoMobi_> on Android webview
[10:10:34] <arschmitz> its just strange that its on browser stack too
[10:11:07] <uGoMobi_> hardware acceleration settings maybe?
[10:11:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe i know that the webview app we were given has it turned off
[10:12:02] <arschmitz> maybe its needed to pull off that kind of transition?
[10:13:05] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: yeah, looks like that
[10:13:21] <arschmitz> ok that makes sense actually
[10:14:07] <arschmitz> so there is nothing we can do on this probably
[10:14:08] <uGoMobi_> point is that it would be nice if it didn't pass the support test either
[10:14:32] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah anyway to check that?
[10:15:26] <uGoMobi_> question is... do we need an option positionFixed or option to turn off transition
[10:16:14] <uGoMobi_> because now it looks like the problem is not position fixed but the transition
[10:16:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: right now there is both
[10:16:39] <uGoMobi_> however, it did work with position absolute instead of fixed
[10:17:20] <arschmitz> uGoMobi_: yeah i think the extra complexity of having both the transition and fixs is just too much with out the acceleration
[10:17:49] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: I agree, it seems to be the combination and not just one of them
[10:18:19] <arschmitz> so maybe just leave both options then people can decide whats more important fixed position or transition?
[10:18:45] <uGoMobi_> yeah sounds like a good idea
[10:19:29] <arschmitz> hmm im looking at something that makes it sound lik you can test for hardware acceleration
[10:25:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: nevermind i dont think you can its only an issue in apps (and im guessing browserstack because there is no hardware lol) and its up to the app developer to turn it on or off
[10:26:06] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: I never heard of a way to check it either
[10:26:09] <arschmitz> funny though that android just gives up and does nothing in this case but still fires the animation complete event
[10:26:35] <uGoMobi_> yeah
[10:27:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i wonder if we could put in a failsafe?
[10:42:34] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: so the panel is where its suposed to be and is visible its just not being drawn or something 
[10:46:07] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: even causing a full redraw wont make it show though
[10:49:46] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: yeah it's weird
[10:50:00] <uGoMobi_> arschmitz: that makes me not wanna give up yet ;)
[11:16:19] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: maybe try and see if you can force a redraw at the end of complete
[12:06:41] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: OK, this jQUery git build failure does appear to be spurious ...
[12:08:16] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_ johnbender want me to take a look?
[12:08:29] <DaveMethvin> we're putting out 1.9 rc1 tomorrow
[12:10:42] <_|Nix|_> DaveMethvin: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Phantom%20Master%20jQuery%20Git/229/
[12:14:30] <DaveMethvin> _|Nix|_: which tests? I'm guessing you have the $.browser ones under control
[12:14:52] <DaveMethvin> is it possible these are related to focus/blur events?
[12:24:46] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: nope, it was something odd on our end
[12:25:04] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: tests are green
[12:26:17] <DaveMethvin> vunderful
[12:30:56] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I agree :)
[12:31:12] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: still working on the popup side in opera
[12:31:23] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: arschmitz: I have dialogs working though I had to add g'damn timeout 
[12:31:33] <johnbender> I cut myself a couple of times to compensate :P
[12:31:54] * johnbender notes that he probably shouldn't make light of real mental health issues
[12:37:30] <arschmitz> hi johnbender 
[12:37:52] <arschmitz> johnbender: have you had any luck with the back button stuff? 
[12:38:02] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you still here?
[12:38:02] <johnbender> arschmitz: that's what I'm working on
[12:38:09] <arschmitz> johnbender: cool 
[12:38:27] <johnbender> arschmitz: hopefully dealing with this case in opera will fix the issues in other browsers as well
[12:38:32] <johnbender> it was the easiest for me to start testing
[12:38:47] <arschmitz> johnbender: the problem seems the same in all of them so i think it will
[12:39:06] <arschmitz> yeah opera is much easier to fix since it has a console
[12:41:15] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah the dialog one was simple but the popup one is more complex
[12:41:24] <johnbender> "simple" with a timeout at least
[12:41:50] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: the timeout situation isn't as bad as it used to be either because we're still working with either popstate or hashchange, not both
[12:41:56] <arschmitz> timeout :( 
[12:41:58] <johnbender> still sucks though
[12:42:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: yah, in my head there was a deterministic solution to the problem but it was breaking other things in the tests
[12:42:27] <arschmitz> the only timeouts i dont mind are 0 ones 
[12:42:29] <johnbender> I'm trying to get the fix in and then make it pretty after it's workign
[12:43:00] <arschmitz> johnbender: yeah get it done enough for 1.3 beta then deal with it after
[12:43:52] <arschmitz> johnbender: i dont mind 0 timeouts because it makes sense that at times you just need to allow the stack to unwind its not an indeterminit timeing thing. 
[12:47:40] <johnbender> arschmitz: the problem here is that the browsers are consistent with regards to when they fire events
[12:48:01] <johnbender> arschmitz: chrome fires a popstate when you make a hash assignment (window.location.hash = foo)
[12:48:15] <johnbender> it actually completely stops execution at that point and fires popstate handlers :/
[12:48:20] <johnbender> opera doesn't do that
[12:48:55] <arschmitz> johnbender: thats not nice and apparent chrome desktop does but ios chrome dosent
[12:49:05] <arschmitz> and ios safari does
[12:49:12] <johnbender> arschmitz: well that's an embedded ios webview
[12:49:16] <johnbender> but yah
[12:49:17] <johnbender> it's all fucked
[12:49:33] <arschmitz> yeah its weird though a normal webview works fine though
[12:49:43] <arschmitz> same as ios safari
[12:49:53] <arschmitz> both of which fire the popstate
[12:50:06] <arschmitz> so there is just no consistancy at all
[12:51:05] <johnbender> none
[12:51:10] <johnbender> none whatsoever
[12:52:26] <arschmitz> isnt the timeing of popstate events completely inconsistant too i think you talked about it in your throne of js talk ?
[12:53:18] <johnbender> arschmitz: chrome doesn't fire the popstate on hash assignment when the hash is exactly the same as the current one 
[12:53:21] <johnbender> lolol
[12:53:23] <johnbender> so fucked
[12:54:20] <arschmitz> is it so much to ask to follow a stardard ??
[12:54:39] <arschmitz> im could have sworn there was some organization that writes stuff like that lol
[12:55:56] <arschmitz> johnbender: oh well ...
[12:56:15] <johnbender> arschmitz: well our use case is non standard that's for sure
[12:56:19] <johnbender> I haven't looked at the spec closely
[12:56:25] <johnbender> so I don't know if it covers this case
[12:56:30] <johnbender> ie, hash assignment
[12:56:52] <johnbender> in the past I've looked to see what the spec said about bugs (safari had one that didn't fit with my interpretation of the spec)
[12:56:57] <johnbender> but who knows
[12:57:08] <arschmitz> johnbender: yes thats true neither have i but assuming there IS one someone here clearly isnt following it 
[13:19:47] * _|Nix|_ is reading the discussion ...
[13:19:57] <_|Nix|_> So, we're back to using a timeout, eh?
[13:20:26] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: popup question for you
[13:20:32] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: What's up?
[13:20:58] <arschmitz> is there a reason that after resize you always repostion to window and ignore positionTo?
[13:21:33] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yes. The positionTo might no longer be on-screen, and bringing it back into view involves an ugly jump of the entire page.
[13:21:57] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Conversely, you don't want the popup to disappear off the screen when you resize the content.
[13:22:14] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: hmm ok
[13:22:45] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Centering on the window is a compromize for an "orphaned" popup.
[13:22:56] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Or an "uprooted" popup.
[13:23:13] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah i was trying to do something with popups that dosent look like its going to work
[13:23:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: in this particular case i would be fine with it going off screen lol
[13:25:05] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Lemme see if there's not something you can do during popupbeforeposition ...
[13:25:48] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: ok there is a simple enough alternative not using popups at all for my case that honestly probably make more sense
[13:26:22] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You could call reposition() during popupbeforeposition
[13:26:35] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: good idea
[13:26:40] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Then it would position your popup twice, but that should have no visual effect.
[13:27:15] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Oh, wait - no.
[13:27:35] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Currently it's hardcoded to do reposition({positionTo: "window"}) ...
[13:27:58] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: You could extend popup and overwrite the way reposition works to basically ignore the hardcoded call.
[13:28:25] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: its fine anyway there is another simple solution for me http://billdodgewholesaledirect.com/wholesale_inventory/4dr%20Car/Used/2006/BMW/3%20Series/325i_/westbrook/Maine/WBAVB13556KX42403/4dr%20Car_2006_BMW_3%20Series_325i_westbrookMaine_WBAVB13556KX42403.php most of the top menu item open a popup thats looks like a second nav bar 
[13:28:49] <arschmitz> i should probably just add the extra navbars to header then hide and show them based on click instead of a popup
[13:29:13] <arschmitz> a lot less overhead then popups
[13:30:13] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'm thinking that maybe I should add a data parameter to popupbeforeposition wherein you can specify the new position.
[13:30:52] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: not a bad idea im sure there are other cases where people would want to always position to an element regardless of if its on screen or not
[13:30:55] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: It's set to { positionTo: "window" } by default, but you can change that, and if you do, your parameters will end up in the call to reposition()
[13:31:00] <arschmitz> or may want to position to a whole new element
[13:31:17] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: Yeah ...
[13:31:53] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: In a way, currently it's hardcoded and only accessible in a really roundabout way.
[13:32:31] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: yeah when i noticed it i wasent sure if it was intentional or not but it seemed like it was 
[13:32:52] <arschmitz> and the logic behind it makes sense but an easier way to modify would be cool
[13:49:34] <_|Nix|_> arschmitz: I'll make it a data parameter ...
[14:05:34] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_ cool
[14:09:17] <toddmparker> so are we doomed on panels or what?
[14:16:12] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: i wouldnt say doomed
[14:16:20] <arschmitz> its a kinda multi facted issue
[14:16:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: we just need to document well i think
[14:18:47] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: to pull off a transition of two different fixed position elements at the same time android 100% requires hardware acceleration

[14:18:59] <jqcommit> 13api.jquerymobile.com/06master 1482f3bfd 15Scott GonzÃ¡lez: Upgrade to grunt-jquery-content 0.8.1.
[14:19:59] <arschmitz> so in the webview app we were given hardware acceleration is disabled so they wont work
[14:20:23] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: and im guessing since there is no hardware browserstack dosent show hardware acceleration either
[14:21:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: to fix you can use a non-fixed header or not use position fixed on panel either one will fix
[14:21:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: you can also disable the animation to fix
[14:21:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: so we just need to document in your using in a webview either enable hardware acceleration or turn something off
[14:22:09] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: and if your in an emulator this combination will not work

[15:04:04] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yeah.
[15:04:47] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I was just gonna say that jqm-demos.css is mostly generic, and web-ui-fw uses pretty much all of it, so there's no reason to split it up.
[15:05:14] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ah ok, great
[15:05:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: I mean, I'd need the swatches and everything for the view-source stuff so, at that point, I might as well include the whole thing.
[15:06:03] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: And demo-specific CSS should go into a <style> tag anyway, since we'll want to display it in the source view :)
[15:06:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: yeah only little bit of the CSS is jqm demos specific
[15:06:19] <uGoMobi> right
[15:06:32] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and we want web-ui-fw demos to look as much as possible like jQM demos.
[15:08:49] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: we will have to see with new docs & demos
[15:09:02] <uGoMobi> demos is just temporary
[15:09:28] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Well, web-ui-fw will follow along, if all goes well ...
[15:09:35] <uGoMobi> demos folder i mean
[15:09:44] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Right.

[16:28:50] <toddmparker> where did we land with panels today? i was in a loooong meeting
[16:31:41] <toddmparker> i can catch up tomorrow, no worries
[17:09:44] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: You still around?
[19:26:31] <toddmparker_> hey arschmitz 
[19:27:50] <toddmparker_> one thing I just noticed, on this page where I disable the panel fixed position, there are no animations. that's not right. http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/demos/panels/panel-nav-form.html
[19:28:08] <toddmparker_> the fixed positioned header/panel demo looks quite a bit better now, nice
