[12:49:05] <StevenBlack> Am I dreaming or was there once a clearfix class in jQuery Mobile's css?
[15:17:43] <toddparker_> Looks like the back toolbar button can be nixed for sure
[16:20:59] <StevenBlack> toddparker: I'm thinking several of the CSS layout helper classes in ui-core would be useful in jQuery Mobile. https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/themes/base/jquery.ui.core.css -- .ui-helper-hidden, .ui-helper-reset, .ui-helper-clearfix ....
[16:22:23] <StevenBlack> For example, issue 1632 is solved by adding a clearing div element to each <li> element when really, the framework should provide the common helper classes used in the ui-sister project.
