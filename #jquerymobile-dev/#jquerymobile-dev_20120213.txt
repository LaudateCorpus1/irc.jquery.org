[07:32:20] <Wilto> ’Morning, guys.
[09:41:06] <Wilto> Hey gseguin, you around yet?
[09:41:35] <gseguin> Wilto: busy with Jive things, will ping you in a few
[09:41:35] <bot-t> (41 hours 10 mins ago) <johnbender> tell gseguin https://twitter.com/#!/topfunky/status/168467190763372544 you retweeted that?
[09:41:36] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from topfunky: "Node.js is the future of the server side." – @wardcunningham #nodepdx ★ http://bit.ly/zkDhE1
[09:42:08] <Wilto> Cool, cool. Just a heads-up: I’m getting “Access-Control-Allow-Origin” issues on the builder API.
[09:42:16] <Wilto> No rush, though.
[09:48:54] <gseguin> johnbender: I did retweet that, why?
[10:01:48] <johnbender> gseguin: c'mon guy you can't seriously think that node is the "future of the server"
[10:02:02] <johnbender> not all server side tasks are io bound
[10:02:19] <johnbender> and not all io bound tasks are complex enough to warrant coopperative multitasking
[10:02:24] <gseguin> I'm not saying it is
[10:02:34] <gseguin> ward cunningham did
[10:02:42] <johnbender> gseguin: perpetuator!
[10:02:49] * johnbender points his finger
[10:02:50] <gseguin> :)
[10:02:52] <johnbender> gseguin: :D
[10:03:45] <gseguin> I think what's to take from that statement is that node is not just prototyping server anymore
[10:04:19] <Wilto> Node.js is sweet.
[10:04:27] <Wilto> I ain’t ever gonna use it for anything, but it’s sweet.
[10:05:01] <Wilto> If we’re being serious, this is obviously the future of webservers: http://secretgeek.net/dod_intro.asp
[10:05:32] <gseguin> lol
[10:06:12] <Wilto> I knew there was no way I’d ever regret these “DOS6 LYFE” knuckle tattoos.
[10:06:48] <johnbender> gseguin: so the tweet should be "Node is totally ready for production"
[10:07:48] <johnbender> I'm just giving you a hard time here (I hope that's obvious)
[10:08:08] <johnbender> and I do think there is a set of problems and teams for which node makes perfect sense
[10:08:10] <gseguin> :)
[10:08:54] <johnbender> but the hype is crazy town
[10:09:49] <Wilto> I do hate that WebSockets === Node.js for most people.
[10:10:10] <Wilto> Well. “For some people.”
[10:57:28] <gseguin> do we have the bb sync up meeting today?
[11:01:20] <johnbender> gseguin: todd sent out a basecamp post, I guess they talked in the UK
[11:01:54] <gseguin> oops missed that
[11:02:01] <gseguin> thanks
[11:46:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: gseguin: Wilto: kinblas: I'm switching the docs back to /js/ until I can come up with something more comprehensive
[11:46:24] <Wilto> NOOOO
[11:46:30] <johnbender> eg, *.php -> *.js
[11:46:35] <Wilto> Actually, yes. That’s cool with me.
[11:47:09] <johnbender> I can't come up with a quick hack of any sort that doesn't involve .htaccess so I'm just going to switch and deal with it long term
[11:54:23] <kinblas> johnbender: okie dokie :-)
[12:09:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: were we supposed to update our playbooks to 2.0?
[12:09:14] <kinblas> toddmparker_: can you send out the info on how to do that?
[12:24:36] <Wilto> johnbender: Responding to your… responsive asset questions now.
[13:10:43] <gseguin> kinblas: https://bdsc.webapps.blackberry.com/html5/beta/bbtablet20/register
[13:11:16] <Wilto> johnbender: Just responded; feel free to pester if I left anything out or breezed over any questions due to my obliviousness.
[13:12:08] <kinblas> gseguin: thanks!
[14:17:06] <toddmparker_> hey guys
[14:17:14] <toddmparker_> my interwebs has been a mess
[14:17:37] <toddmparker_> hey kinblas - you still here?
[14:18:04] <toddmparker_> i upgraded to the playbook 2.0 beta. it's nice but still has issues
[14:18:17] <toddmparker_> the official release is supposed ot be in the next few weeks
[14:18:27] <kinblas> toddmparker_: ok, I was wondering if we were supposed to install 2.0 or not
[14:18:29] <toddmparker_> so you could wait
[14:18:39] <kinblas> you guys have a 1.x playbook too?
[14:18:51] <toddmparker_> wish jason was here to ask
[14:18:56] <toddmparker_> maybe there is a newer build
[14:19:02] <toddmparker_> the link i used was old
[14:19:05] <toddmparker_> yep
[14:19:08] <toddmparker_> i have like 5 now
[14:19:21] <toddmparker_> i got one for being a speaker at jQ UK this weekend
[14:19:33] <toddmparker_> they gave away 100 to attenndees
[14:19:46] <Wilto> We use them as coasters, here.

[14:21:38] <gseguin> k
[14:21:51] <toddmparker_> johnbender: you're switching back to a static js include on /test/ ?
[14:22:17] <toddmparker_> my pb 2.0 was dying a lot loading pages. maybe that will help
[14:24:44] <gseguin> I think he's going to use the php combine for now
[14:33:03] <toddmparker_> ok
[14:33:04] <toddmparker_> cool
[14:48:50] <toddmparker_> johnbender: you around?
[14:50:03] <toddmparker_> or gseguin
[14:50:14] <toddmparker_> odd. so if you go to any page on /test/
[14:50:32] <toddmparker_> the top header is huge and the buttons aren't in place
[14:50:32] <toddmparker_> was ok a few hours ago

[16:52:42] <gseguin> johnbender: now I am
[16:53:23] <johnbender> gseguin: I have to head home real quick but I'm just doing a quick "js/" -> "js/jquery.mobile.docs.js"
[16:53:34] <johnbender> to solve the docs compile part of this
[16:53:46] <gseguin> ok
[16:53:50] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm running into some issues so I thought I would ask
[16:54:03] <gseguin> I can try to take a look
[16:54:08] <gseguin> is it pushed?
[16:54:11] <johnbender> gseguin: no
[16:54:20] <johnbender> gseguin: I'll push what I have to a branch
[16:54:28] <gseguin> sounds good
[16:54:40] <johnbender> I think the docs build target doesn't have properly compiled jquery.mobile.docs in place yet
[16:54:43] <johnbender> or some such
[16:55:10] <johnbender> that is
[16:55:16] <johnbender> I think the js build target has to run first
[16:56:54] <gseguin> hmm
[16:57:01] <johnbender> gseguin: branch name is back to the include
[16:57:12] <gseguin> k
