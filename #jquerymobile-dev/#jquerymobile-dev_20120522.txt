[01:42:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/urGEjg
[01:42:09] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] fixed a typo - Jasper de Groot
[02:08:33] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Anne are you here?
[02:51:16] <agcolom> uGoMobi, yes, just briefly
[02:51:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: goodmorning Anne
[02:51:46] <uGoMobi> ok quick question
[02:51:51] <agcolom> yes
[02:52:06] <agcolom> Good Morning :-)
[02:52:30] <uGoMobi> do you know if there is a difference between Firefox for Mobile and Fennec?
[02:52:41] <uGoMobi> since you are friends with Mozilla ;-)
[02:52:47] <agcolom> oops no idea, sorry
[02:52:58] <agcolom> I can ask...
[02:53:19] <uGoMobi> strange that i can't find a website where this is explained
[02:53:26] <uGoMobi> we support Firefox Mobile 10
[02:53:44] <uGoMobi> JQM is not working anymore on Fennec 4 since 1.1
[02:53:53] <agcolom> ah...
[02:54:03] <uGoMobi> only tested on simulator
[02:54:33] <uGoMobi> I just wanted to check if we support Fennec at all
[02:54:54] <agcolom> I really don't know. Probably a question for toddparker
[02:55:18] <uGoMobi> yeah will ask him later
[02:55:23] <agcolom> He should be online in a few hours...
[02:55:35] <agcolom> btw, i've just seen that you have pushed a new commit to master. Will you cherry-pick into 1.1-stable?
[02:55:37] <uGoMobi> BTW - i fixed typo on supported platform page
[02:56:04] <uGoMobi> now i can cherry-pick into 1.1 right? or is that interfering with your strategy?
[02:56:07] <agcolom> yes, (silly typo :-) well spotted, although I like Firebox as a name ;-) )
[02:56:15] <uGoMobi> haha
[02:56:26] <agcolom> no that's fine, I don't know what instructions you have been given
[02:57:06] <uGoMobi> just asking caused you mentioned something about not picking all because of popup in navmenu
[02:57:51] <uGoMobi> no instructions about cherry picking but I suppose we want this kind of fixes to land in 1.1.1 as well
[02:57:56] <agcolom> yes, in my case the pages folder have files that have the popup in navmenu
[02:58:10] <agcolom> yes, if there is no conflict it should be cerry-picked
[02:58:14] <agcolom> cherry-picked.
[02:58:57] <uGoMobi> ok then will just do that after i am ready cloning (soooooooo slowwwwww)
[02:59:45] <uGoMobi> you know what... 1 more question ;-)   about docs > toolbars > persistent toolbars
[02:59:51] <agcolom> gseguin and johnbender are the git gurus if you have trouble.
[02:59:52] <agcolom> yes
[03:00:27] <uGoMobi> what do you think about moving info to the first page?
[03:00:34] <uGoMobi> where it was before
[03:00:59] <uGoMobi> now it is "hidden" behind 4 navbar button in footer
[03:01:40] <uGoMobi> looks like just another sample page after 3 buttons that link to dummy content
[03:02:56] <agcolom> yes, I agree, that's really easy to miss. Good catch! Maybe we go for info as 1st button and default. I'd like to ask toddparker if he agrees.
[03:03:25] <uGoMobi> actually he is the one who moved it to the last page ;-)
[03:03:52] <agcolom> well, even better reaso to ask then ;-)
[03:03:53] <uGoMobi> but I had really trouble finding the information
[03:04:32] <uGoMobi> yeah lets ask
[03:04:34] <agcolom> yes, I had also missed it completely. You press the 1st 3 buttons and you expect the last one to be of the same nature and have the same effect
[03:05:09] <uGoMobi> exactly
[03:05:27] <uGoMobi> after 2nd and 3rd you get the idea... i never made it number 4 ;-)
[03:05:48] <agcolom> same here ;-)
[03:05:55] <uGoMobi> anyway... todd asked me to change info about navbars
[03:06:08] <uGoMobi> if he agrees i will include this change as well
[03:06:13] <agcolom> great !
[03:06:37] <agcolom> ok, have to go now... catch you later...
[03:06:46] <uGoMobi> ok thanks for your help
[03:06:51] <uGoMobi> and have a nice day!
[03:11:09] <uGoMobi> toddparker: Can you tell me the difference between Firefox Mobile 10 (which we support) and Fennec 4? Last one is not working anymore with new page transitions (tested on simulator).

[07:28:35] <toddparker> hi all
[07:28:50] <toddparker> uGoMobi and agcolom - totally agree about the persistent navbar docs
[07:29:05] <toddparker> the first page you get to should really be the docs
[07:29:08] <toddparker> my bad
[07:29:14] <uGoMobi> toddparker: hi Todd
[07:29:22] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok I will make the changes
[07:29:45] <toddparker> uGoMobi, re: FF mobile vs. Fennic, I assumed that they switched the name form Fennic to Firefox but I have no idea really
[07:30:03] <toddparker> oh, I need your email uGoMobi
[07:30:22] <toddparker> to invite you to basecamp
[07:30:36] <uGoMobi> toddparker: jasper@ugomobi.com
[07:31:00] <uGoMobi> i think it got lost on the scroll here yesterday when you asked ;-)
[07:31:20] <toddparker> yeah, sorry
[07:31:26] <toddparker> IRC is not very permanent
[07:31:34] <toddparker> that's why we use basecamp for some stuff
[07:31:51] <uGoMobi> sounds good
[07:32:27] <toddparker> invite sent
[07:32:36] <toddparker> anyone not have access that should here?
[07:32:47] <toddparker> list looks ok to me, but my brain is fried
[07:36:55] <uGoMobi> ok back in business :)
[07:44:53] <uGoMobi> toddparker: do you have Fennec installed on a device there? i tested with emulator only
[07:46:00] <uGoMobi> or FF mobile since that might be the same
[07:47:09] <toddparker> yeah, i have FF installed on our Android 2.3 and 4.0 devices
[07:47:16] <toddparker> it's confusing there too
[07:47:37] <toddparker> i have 3 different FF icons. what a mess.
[07:47:48] <toddparker> give me a short url and i'll test
[07:47:51] <uGoMobi> what i saw was only initial page
[07:47:56] <toddparker> you have an android device
[07:48:02] <uGoMobi> when transition to new page... just blank
[07:48:40] <uGoMobi> i have samsung s2 but some problems with upgrade to ISC so i think i install 2.3 again
[07:49:19] <uGoMobi> i didnt install FF on it, just tried the Fennec emulator on Linux
[07:51:15] <uGoMobi> shorturl? i tested JQM docs
[07:55:10] <toddparker> oh, yikes
[07:55:14] <toddparker> any page?
[07:55:44] <uGoMobi> every page
[07:55:47] <toddparker> i'm testing master (/test)
[07:55:59] <toddparker> i tested FF mobile for 1.1
[07:56:04] <toddparker> but we'll see
[07:56:27] <uGoMobi> 1.0 is working, 1.1 is not on emulator
[07:56:39] <toddparker> wow, what a slow browser
[07:57:28] <uGoMobi> only on initial page load you see the page, after transition to new page you don't see anything
[08:24:28] <toddparker> uGoMobi: we should beef up how to include JS in your pages into the docs.

[08:49:49] <agcolom> toddparker: persistent navbar docs: great, thanks :-)
[09:02:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: welcome back Anne
[09:03:11] <uGoMobi> agcolom: about adding examples to the docs...
[09:03:21] <agcolom> Hi :-)
[09:05:44] <uGoMobi> agcolom: examples about how to inject/manipulate content and include plugins are really needed
[09:06:09] <uGoMobi> popup examples are for 1.2 so a bit less priority
[09:07:19] <agcolom> ye
[09:07:21] <agcolom> yes
[09:08:14] <uGoMobi> i think we have to create some kind of outline of what we want and then i (and maybe MauriceG too) can start creating them
[09:08:17] <uGoMobi> what do you think?
[09:08:50] <uGoMobi> only problem is that i run into issues myself when i try to inject/manipulate stuff :(
[09:09:11] <uGoMobi> but that doesn't mean we can't start
[09:09:11] <agcolom> Yes, I thought we'd start with you page: http://ugomobi.github.com/controlgroup/
[09:09:30] <agcolom> your page sorry I can't type!
[09:10:10] <uGoMobi> haha  ... shouldnt have mentioned it because i didnt even notice ;-)
[09:11:07] <toddparker> if you all run into issues, let' sfigure out the "right" way and document it or it's a bug we should fix
[09:11:17] <uGoMobi> ok, where should i put that example?
[09:11:49] <uGoMobi> yes
[09:12:00] <agcolom> You mentioned creating a Branch, are you still happy with that?
[09:12:31] <uGoMobi> yes
[09:12:50] <uGoMobi> we just merge into master after each example is ready
[09:12:55] <agcolom> then that mean we can all test and possibly add as well
[09:13:05] <uGoMobi> yes
[09:13:27] <agcolom> yes, that's a possibility, provided we've tested thoroughly as well
[09:13:29] <uGoMobi> and now i can commit we dont have to work with PR's
[09:13:37] <agcolom> yes
[09:14:11] <uGoMobi> but in that branch... on what (new) page do we put the example?
[09:14:56] <uGoMobi> should we create a new example section?
[09:15:18] <agcolom> I'd have it where it belongs... let's check...
[09:17:49] <agcolom> if they are form elements, we could add an item on the menu list saying something like dynamically generated eleemnts
[09:17:52] <agcolom> elements
[09:18:12] <agcolom> dynamically created elements?
[09:20:52] <uGoMobi> ok, so that means a new page in the forms folder
[09:21:20] <agcolom> yes... What do you think?
[09:21:43] <uGoMobi> but a controlgroup can be used for buttons too so we could add a page there as well
[09:21:55] <uGoMobi> yeah sounds could to me
[09:22:07] <uGoMobi> typo: could > good
[09:22:16] <agcolom> good :-)
[09:22:20] <uGoMobi> haha  sounds the same  ;-)
[09:23:14] <uGoMobi> Or maybe we should just call it "examples" in the left navmenu
[09:23:39] <uGoMobi> that gives some freedom if we want to add other stuff later, like a popup with a form
[09:23:46] <uGoMobi> i dunno, just thinking out loud
[09:26:21] <agcolom> I am thinking that there are already examples in every page of the docs. So I think just "examples" might be confusing
[09:26:57] <uGoMobi> oh ok, yes
[09:27:52] <uGoMobi> well lets just get started, as long as not in stable we could always change a name
[09:27:53] <agcolom> otherwise we could have it there: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-scripting.html
[09:28:36] <uGoMobi> i will copy that example to a new page in the forms folder and create a simular one for the buttons folder
[09:29:22] <agcolom> great idea. We can add a note on that page-scripting page to say where to find examples
[09:30:26] <uGoMobi> to be honest i think that first page should cover the basics and this coding examples at the end
[09:30:41] <uGoMobi> yeah it is a good idea to put a link on that page
[09:31:20] <agcolom> Agree as well (basics and then coding examples)
[09:32:14] <uGoMobi> i don't include a navmenu on the example page yet
[09:33:31] <uGoMobi> wait... i can include a navmenu
[09:33:48] <uGoMobi> just have to include it on every other page too
[09:34:02] <uGoMobi> was just thinking about conflict when merging into master
[09:34:09] <jq-jenkins> Yippie, build fixed!
[09:34:09] <jq-jenkins> Project jQuery Mobile Latest build #2,877: FIXED in 1 min 28 sec: http://swarm.jquery.org:8080/job/jQuery%20Mobile%20Latest/2877/
[09:38:02] <agcolom> uGoMobi We can add it on every page when ready to merge
[09:39:40] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yeah, i saw problems that aren't actually there :)
[09:39:52] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[09:40:09] <agcolom> Hi Maurice :-)
[09:40:13] <MauriceG> Hi uGoMobi!
[09:40:28] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4390#issuecomment-5851189
[09:40:28] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4390 on jquery-mobile (bmurmistro; 3d, 21h ago): showPageLoadingMsg not displaying spinner image on initial page load
[09:40:40] <MauriceG> Hi Anne :-)  Nice to see you all!
[09:41:11] <uGoMobi> i don't see the problem there... i think it is expected behaviour
[09:41:51] <uGoMobi> depends on where he puts the alert script and deferred/async loading i suppose
[09:43:08] <uGoMobi> or am i wrong?
[09:43:20] <MauriceG> May it depends where the script is... ?
[09:44:12] <uGoMobi> i mean when the alert function is called
[09:44:41] <uGoMobi> he uses pageshow event
[09:45:03] <MauriceG> But he says, with ff it wors fine.  But who want to see an alert and a spinner ??
[09:45:16] <MauriceG> wors := works ...
[09:45:28] <uGoMobi> yeah i dont get it either
[09:46:03] <agcolom> he mentioned it doesn't work for him with Chrome, but which version and which OS?
[09:46:18] <uGoMobi> maybe FF treats alert messages differently
[09:46:44] <MauriceG> I will try my browsers on Win
[09:47:06] <uGoMobi> i already tried Chrome, just works as expected
[09:47:32] <Wilto> Hey folks.
[09:47:35] <uGoMobi> at least, what i expected
[09:47:37] <uGoMobi> hi Wilto
[09:47:45] <Wilto> What’s the good word?
[09:48:07] <MauriceG> Chrome 18: Alert and behind just a shadow (no spinner)
[09:48:24] <MauriceG> Hi Wilto!
[09:49:17] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: until you click ok, then the page just loads fine
[09:49:19] <MauriceG> Opera 11.52: Spinner is there ...
[09:49:46] <uGoMobi> i just don't think this has anything to do with JQM
[09:50:01] <MauriceG> Yes, but this is his issue ...
[09:50:18] <MauriceG> FF spinner and alert ...
[09:50:52] <MauriceG> enough ...
[09:51:04] <uGoMobi> i think the alert stops anything else from being loaded, if the browser was already able to load images you see the spinner, if not... then not ;-)
[09:51:49] <MauriceG> mmh. jsbin issue there, jsfiddle not ...
[09:52:01] <uGoMobi> haha sound pretty random
[09:52:09] <MauriceG> yep
[09:53:51] <uGoMobi> wait a sec
[09:54:17] <uGoMobi> i just had another look on that code he is using
[09:54:46] <toddparker> is the sinner now showing at all or jus tot spinning (animating)
[09:54:47] <uGoMobi> the loading message should be a text, not a function
[09:54:51] <toddparker> heh. spinner.
[09:55:10] <toddparker> 13 more issues to close to get us below 500
[09:55:13] <toddparker> go, go, go
[09:55:22] <toddparker> we were at 580+ recently
[09:55:25] <toddparker> nice work all
[09:55:36] <uGoMobi> yeah spending far too much time on this issue
[09:56:47] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: but you start with this :-)
[09:56:49] <uGoMobi> toddparker: 512 issues - 28 PR's - 28 issues solved by those PR's = 456 :-)
[09:57:01] <uGoMobi> yeah i know MauriceG
[09:57:06] <uGoMobi> was talking to myself
[09:57:54] <MauriceG> But first I did not get him at all. Now he explains what he really want to do.
[09:58:39] <uGoMobi> yeah same here
[10:01:08] <MauriceG> puuh.  In my fiddle, the spinner is lost when the alert is clicked ...
[10:01:57] <uGoMobi> i think he stole it ;-)
[10:02:32] <MauriceG> Yes, it seems he likes spinners more then pages ...
[10:21:00] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: Do you remember yesterday when Todd ask for the oomlate ?  I still grin ...
[10:29:56] <uGoMobi> Umlaut yes :)
[10:30:17] <uGoMobi> i was about to say... ask Maurice
[10:31:28] <MauriceG> Yes, at the first moment (I never saw the word oomlate before), I thougt he asked you for how to make a Dutch Omelette :-)

[11:02:36] <gseguin> Wilto: ^
[11:03:06] <uGoMobi> gseguin: so, if multiple commits in pr, you pick the merge commit. right?
[11:03:17] <gseguin> cherry-picking the merge commit is probably safer
[11:03:33] <uGoMobi> ok clear
[11:03:45] <gseguin> otherwise you're taking the risk of forgetting commits
[11:03:49] <Wilto> Gotcha, gseguin.

[11:07:24] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4414 on jquery-mobile (ToddThomson; 21h, 33m ago): FixedToolbar widget tapToggle option default
[11:07:32] <toddparker> You should consider having some documentation on overriding widget options for jQM apps that want to take advantage of platform hardware capabilities.
[11:07:33] <toddparker> Ex: How to extend widget options:
[11:07:34] <toddparker> $.extend($.mobile.fixedtoolbar.prototype.options, {
[11:07:34] <uGoMobi> no Cloud today, only sunshine :-)
[11:07:35] <toddparker> tapToggle: false
[11:07:35] <toddparker> });
[11:08:22] <uGoMobi> sorry for interupting your code todd
[11:08:27] <uGoMobi> :-)
[11:09:01] <uGoMobi> i opened a ticket for examples in docs
[11:10:08] <uGoMobi> will add this one there
[11:19:22] <_|Nix|_> Hey, so I have found the cause for the popup-sometimes-not-showing-up-in-Safari issue, but I have no idea how to fix it. Using firebug on my Safari/Windows, I have found that the offsetLeft/offsetTop property for the container div are still set to (-9999,-99999) when the popup shows up on screen (as if the ui-selectmenu-hidden class were still in place).
[11:20:03] <_|Nix|_> However, after I open a popup that fixes the issue and then re-open the login form, the offsetLeft/offsetTop is set to the same thing as the css left/top, so it appears on the screen.
[11:20:43] <_|Nix|_> I've tried to set this._ui.container[0].offsetLeft = the_right_x_coord and similarly for offsetTop, but no dice.
[11:21:51] <_|Nix|_> Might be a bug in Safari that when you remove a class, the offsetLeft/offsetTop are not reset.
[11:21:56] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ how about when you have the same form popup but say a pop transition or no transition?
[11:22:10] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Good point. I'll check.
[11:22:22] <agcolom>  _|Nix|_ also how about a different popup with that same transition?
[11:22:37] <toddparker> good ideas to narrow that down
[11:23:22] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Then the offsetLeft and offsetTop are set correctly right away ...
[11:23:46] <agcolom> ah....
[11:23:47] <_|Nix|_> So, something about the slidedown animation does not set the offsetLeft and offsetTop ...
[11:24:06] <agcolom> yep. Now we know where to look ;-)
[11:24:27] <agcolom> how about slideup?
[11:25:33] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Probably the same thing.
[11:25:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yep - also broken.
[11:26:23] <agcolom> good ;-) at least that's logical :-)
[11:26:42] <_|Nix|_> It's extremely flaky, BTW: If I place the popup that, when opened, fixes everything, at location a in the document, it successfully fixes things. If I put it elsewhere, it does not fix things.
[11:27:02] <_|Nix|_> And I mean I cut it out of one place in the page and I paste it elsewhere.
[11:27:32] <_|Nix|_> It shouldn't even matter where it is on the page, because in the process of enhancement, it gets ripped out of whereever it is and put after the content.
[11:27:41] <_|Nix|_> Yet it matters where I put it. Insane.
[11:27:58] <_|Nix|_> I suspect this might be a webkit bug.
[11:28:17] <agcolom> could this be related? (https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4387)
[11:28:18] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4387 on jquery-mobile (ocorbun; 4d, 3h ago): slide transition fails on fullscreen iPhone
[11:28:25] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_ on Safari 5.0.5 on win, the popup keeps the coordinates as suggested (-9999px)  But it is shown ...
[11:28:48] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Well, this is 5.1.7 on Windoze ...
[11:29:10] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: ... a regression perhaps?
[11:29:28] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: ... or perhaps stricter adherence to specs ... *shrug* ...
[11:30:19] <_|Nix|_> I don't even know how to set those ... I'll try to set them on animation complete ...
[11:31:03] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ can you try with JQM 1.0.1?
[11:31:08] <agcolom> (just an idea)
[11:31:53] <MauriceG> yes, it seems so. Safari 5.1.2 on win: Just the overlay ...
[11:32:13] <toddparker> uGoMobi: been testing FF mobile
[11:32:48] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok, and did it work?
[11:33:12] <toddparker> i have 4.0b2, 10.0.4, 13.0
[11:33:22] <toddparker> fixed toolbars, right?
[11:33:47] <uGoMobi> not just fixed toolbars... i didn't see any page at all after transition
[11:34:01] <toddparker> riight
[11:34:08] <uGoMobi> any page in the docs
[11:34:10] <toddparker> sorry, i was testing fixed for a filament project just now.
[11:34:12] <toddparker> hold on...
[11:36:16] <toddparker> works great in 13 (latest) on 2.3
[11:37:11] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:37:36] <uGoMobi> well than it's probably only a Fennec issue
[11:37:43] <uGoMobi> thanks for testing
[11:37:45] <toddparker> still good back on 10.0.4
[11:38:18] <toddparker> i mean, it's slower than the default browser so i dunno why anyone would use it but it works fine
[11:38:26] <uGoMobi> 4.0b2 is Fennec?
[11:38:36] <uGoMobi> yeah that's another question :-)
[11:38:37] <toddparker> aniated gif is smoooooth
[11:38:49] <uGoMobi> haha
[11:39:29] <toddparker> guess this proves emulators are not to be trusted
[11:39:41] <toddparker> moment of truth…4.0b2
[11:39:46] <johnbender> Side note: in case anyone was loosing sleep at night I've been monitoring the builds while the notifications are turned off and we're in pretty good shape for the most part
[11:39:57] <johnbender> we still have some intermitent failures that I should look at but nothing too bad
[11:40:20] <toddparker> bah. that is busted but it's a really old version
[11:40:25] <uGoMobi> johnbender: cool
[11:40:28] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Same problem.
[11:40:31] <toddparker> good to hear johnbender
[11:40:58] <uGoMobi> toddparker: are you testing latest on Fennec 4.0b2?
[11:41:04] <toddparker> uGoMobi: all of these say FF in the icon nd about pages
[11:41:26] <uGoMobi> toddparker: sorry i dont understand what you mean
[11:41:26] <toddparker> but i think the 4.x gee ration was called fennic on their blog posts
[11:41:46] <uGoMobi> oh ok i get it
[11:41:48] <toddparker> i have 3 Firefox browsers installed on my 2.3 phone
[11:42:03] <toddparker> instead of updating, each time it would load a new icon
[11:42:22] <toddparker> ironically, the one with the "beta" flag on the icon is the latest
[11:42:39] <toddparker> so newer versions are fine
[11:42:43] <toddparker> 4.x is busted
[11:42:49] <toddparker> but that is ancient
[11:43:01] <toddparker> and i'd be shocked if many people even used that
[11:43:01] <uGoMobi> ok so nothing to worry about
[11:43:15] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... No idea why this is happening ...
[11:43:31] <uGoMobi> i dunno... even when performance is bad... many mozilla fans out there
[11:44:01] <toddparker> sure, but they will be running a newer version
[11:44:07] <toddparker> that one is from the dark ages
[11:44:13] <toddparker> like 1.5 years ago
[11:44:16] <toddparker> :)
[11:44:21] <uGoMobi> but as long as the version that we support (FF mobile 10+) is fine it is ok.
[11:44:29] <toddparker> yeah, works there
[11:44:39] <uGoMobi> Just didn't know where to "place" Fennec
[11:44:45] <toddparker> 10+ is great
[11:44:50] <uGoMobi> cool
[11:44:55] <toddparker> is that what we claim to support?
[11:45:12] <uGoMobi> thanks again for testing... let me uninstalled that Fennec emulator right away
[11:45:19] <toddparker> fennec seems like an early working title they placed on 4.x
[11:45:24] <toddparker> heh
[11:45:33] <toddparker> so you can't get a FF mobile running a newer build?
[11:45:42] <uGoMobi> Firefox Mobile (10 Beta)
[11:46:00] <uGoMobi> that's what we say on supported platform page
[11:47:05] <uGoMobi> i dunno about FF mobile since i thought fennec was new and FF mobile old
[11:48:01] <_|Nix|_> If I remove ui-selectmenu-hidden it works just fine, but, of course, the popup is not hidden ...
[11:50:26] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_ What's if you do not use that class and set the CSS coordinates manually at _create ?
[11:51:39] <_|Nix|_> Marice ... yeah ... I can try that.
[11:53:41] <_|Nix|_> I may have fixed it!!!!!111 Instead of .css({ left: x, top: y }), use .offset({ left: x, top: y })!!!!111
[11:53:44] <MauriceG> That does it !
[11:53:51] <toddparker> BOOM
[11:53:57] <_|Nix|_> Hut diggety!
[11:54:26] <_|Nix|_> Well, spank me around and call me Susie!
[11:54:34] <_|Nix|_> ... but I digress ...
[11:54:44] <agcolom> excellent :-) Champagne ?
[11:54:58] <toddparker> _|Nix|_:  SUSIE!
[11:55:22] <_|Nix|_> Let's not celebrate just yet - should work /everywhere/ before we call it fixed.
[11:56:20] <_|Nix|_> So, whaddya say I push the fix and then we batter the living daylights out of docs/pages/popup/index.html with the entire arsenal of devices at our disposal. I want to see that page a smoldering ruin ...
[11:56:56] <toddparker> yes please
[11:57:48] <_|Nix|_> Just gonona run the unit tests before I push ...
[11:58:21] <MauriceG> Safari 5.0.5 and 5.1.2 on Win, 5.1.5 on iMac. Works!
[11:59:08] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Niceness ...
[12:00:03] <_|Nix|_> D000d! This is insane! With .offset the popup even shows up in the unit tests ... cool!
[12:00:45] <MauriceG> iPad 2: Works ! :-)
[12:00:49] <_|Nix|_> Alright ... I'm impatient ... I've run the popup unit tests, but I have no patience for the full suite ... me go push now ...
[12:00:53] <_|Nix|_> Excellent!

[12:03:16] <_|Nix|_> Sounds like I can close that issue ...
[12:03:28] <MauriceG> iPhone 4S Works Landscape and portrait without moving !  (but you have to work on the position in landscape ;-)
[12:04:05] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: What do you mean I have to work on the position in landscape?
[12:05:04] <MauriceG> Sorry... But it seems the position is centered on the button. If the button is in the middle of the screen, the form popup is just shown half ...
[12:06:30] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Can you post a screenshot?
[12:07:19] <MauriceG> I'm on the way ...
[12:09:35] <_|Nix|_> Interesting ... if I use offset, it sets the offsetLeft and offsetTop correctly, alright, but when the popup is supposed to be hidden, it doesn't set them back to what they were - i.e., (-9999,-99999) ...
[12:09:53] <_|Nix|_> Doesn't seem to matter, because the popup does disappear, but ... you never know ...
[12:11:06] <MauriceG> Is it okay to just paste a link here?   http://maugo.ma.funpic.de/popup.png
[12:11:40] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: .... hmmm ... bad ...
[12:12:38] <agcolom> Isn't that the top value being negative?
[12:12:40] <MauriceG> No...  It is very nice!  You will get this too, I'm sure!
[12:12:54] <_|Nix|_> OK ... I'll try to set the window size to 960x640 ...
[12:14:36] <MauriceG> on ipad 2 landscape: if I move the form button to the top of the screen and tap, the popup is shown nice.
[12:15:06] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Hmmm ... can't reproduce this ...
[12:15:38] <MauriceG> agcolom: the iPod please ...
[12:16:33] <agcolom> yes, I'm here. I can reproduce with  Safari actually. the top value is negative
[12:16:38] <agcolom> hangon...
[12:17:00] <agcolom> will give you something to work with...
[12:17:32] <agcolom> btw, which page should I use to test?
[12:18:20] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ ^
[12:20:04] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What do you mean? I think Maurice used docs/pages/popup/index.html ...
[12:20:15] <agcolom> ok, will check
[12:20:34] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: With what version of Safari have you reproduced it?
[12:21:18] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The top value is almost certainly negative, but why? That's what I need to check ...
[12:22:03] <agcolom> 5.1.5
[12:22:19] <agcolom> is popup branch same as master?
[12:22:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: No. "popup" is ancient.
[12:22:55] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Use master.
[12:23:10] <agcolom> ok... Let me try again then...
[12:23:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: What OS? Windows? OSX?
[12:23:45] <_|Nix|_> Oy ... I dunno if I can install Safari 5.1.5 side-by-side with Safari 5.1.7 ...
[12:24:06] <agcolom> but I was looking at the popup branch.... so maybe it's me
[12:24:37] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Too bad - I would've liked to be able to reproduce this without having to buy an iPhone ...
[12:24:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: ... just like the previous one ...
[12:25:12] <agcolom> nearly ready... hang on...
[12:27:06] <agcolom> ok...
[12:27:38] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ make your safari window about half the size of your screen (height)
[12:27:51] <agcolom> then go to that page: http://jsbin.com/okehir/81/
[12:28:09] <agcolom> then right click form2 and do inpect element.
[12:28:16] <agcolom> inspect element
[12:28:50] <agcolom> so that the web page is v small and the bottom part is taken by the element inspector
[12:28:59] <agcolom> then click form 2
[12:29:16] <agcolom> top is negative and the popup starts before the top of the page
[12:30:24] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: That is a billion times better
[12:30:54] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: What is a billion times better?
[12:30:58] <agcolom> it is the div with ui-popup-container that get top: -86px in my case
[12:31:12] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I don't have "Inspect element" in my Safari ...
[12:31:48] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: But I see - form2 has some room at the bottom, but it is not using it.
[12:31:49] <agcolom> ok, an element inspector at all (just to make the window much smaller
[12:33:26] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_:   use options. and activate developer tools, may the last tab ...
[12:37:16] <toddparker> popup
[12:37:38] <_|Nix|_> OK ... this is the same as Chrome ... cool ...
[12:37:43] <toddparker> there are some smaller positioning/sizing things to work out
[12:37:48] <toddparker> but it's solid now
[12:38:06] <toddparker> just need to test this like crazy on the mobile device
[12:38:13] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Cool!
[12:38:17] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah, absolutely!
[12:38:33] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I'm about to tackle a positioning issue ... :)
[12:38:39] <toddparker> great
[12:40:05] <_|Nix|_> OK ... it seems there's some code in there to leave at least y pixels from the bottom no matter what ...
[12:41:36] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Yeah - I was kinda worried about that no-show bug ... could've kiboshed the whole thing ...
[12:41:44] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ Safari -> preferences -> Advanced -> check the box at teh bottom that says show develop menu in menu bar
[12:41:57] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Yeah - got that ...
[12:42:52] <toddparker> odd that the dialog content body is so wide
[12:42:59] <toddparker> in a popup
[12:43:03] <toddparker> didn't see that before
[12:43:18] <_|Nix|_> Still ... MauriceG's screenshot is much more extreme than what I'm seeing.
[12:44:11] <toddparker> _|Nix|_: missed that
[12:44:16] <toddparker> where is the screenshot?
[12:44:29] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: popup makes no decisions about the width other than to limit it to $( window ).width() - 20
[12:44:35] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: http://maugo.ma.funpic.de/popup.png
[12:44:45] <toddparker> the more i play with this, i wonder if we need to surface an option to not close the popup when you click out
[12:44:53] <toddparker> so people could build more modal style dialogs
[12:45:08] <toddparker> current behavior is the default
[12:45:10] <toddparker> but still
[12:45:23] <MauriceG> I just moved the buttons to the middle of screen and tap form. no other moves then.
[12:45:29] <toddparker> anyway, works quite well in Android 2.3
[12:45:32] <toddparker> feel pretty snappy
[12:45:44] <_|Nix|_> Not bad ...
[12:46:00] <MauriceG> toddparker:  a modal popup ...
[12:46:10] <toddparker> the lack of a down/active state on buttons when i tap them feels odd
[12:46:20] <toddparker> i never quite know if i clicked
[12:46:39] <MauriceG> y
[12:47:06] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: They do have a down state ...
[12:47:50] <toddparker> on touch devices, i'm not seeing one
[12:47:54] <MauriceG> one issue is just. trying around a bit with the popup demos on ipad kills the page after 4, t
[12:48:02] <MauriceG> 5 popups
[12:48:06] <toddparker> or only infrequently
[12:48:13] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Whaaaaa ... ?
[12:48:43] <MauriceG> i think, toddparker  says the same yesterday...
[12:49:28] <toddparker> i didn. but the latest works great
[12:49:45] <toddparker> MauriceG: you testing http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[12:50:11] <MauriceG> yes
[12:51:15] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: Can you narrow it down to a specific sequence of steps that causes the page to die?
[12:51:26] <MauriceG> may 4,5, or 6 taps, one popup come up and no tap can hide it again. just reload helps.

[13:22:52] <MauriceG> as I saw the avatar of johnbender the first time, I thought he is! until I've zoomed in.  Sorry!
[13:23:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I just downloaded the .tar.gz from nodejs.org and I'm building it ...
[13:23:50] <MauriceG> the hood on the head looks like long black hair if the pic is small ...
[13:24:03] <agcolom> Ah, I see :-)
[13:24:39] <johnbender> lol
[13:24:42] <johnbender> awesome
[13:25:04] <MauriceG> as more you zoom as younger he gets.  Sorry johnbender ...
[13:25:04] <_|Nix|_> Funny - I also thought that johnbender had long dark hair from his avatar ...
[13:25:15] <johnbender> lol
[13:25:19] <johnbender> oh well
[13:25:40] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Nah, it's good - keeps people off-balance :)
[13:25:54] <johnbender> while that's not my goal I do find that to be hilarious
[13:25:57] <MauriceG> but know we know it in bigger, cause of his excellent artcl
[13:26:07] <johnbender> if it makes it easier for them to remember me then mores the better
[13:26:14] <MauriceG> article
[13:27:13] <_|Nix|_> Woah ... make sure has changed since last time I ran it ... d000d ...
[13:27:38] <MauriceG> and there is another thing with you, johnbender  most of time I read what write I just see:
[13:27:46] <MauriceG> lorem ipsum dolor ...
[13:28:45] <toddparker> we definitely need to re-position popups on orientation change
[13:29:05] <MauriceG> It seems you have a big, big "thesaurus". ...
[13:29:08] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I guess we should ensure they stay on-screen ...
[13:29:45] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Can we say that when the orientation changes the association with a given button is out the window?
[13:30:04] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: that works too but nave will do that for you
[13:30:29] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ sorry new bug :-(
[13:30:30] <toddparker> MauriceG: I have a motorhead mouse pad
[13:30:36] <toddparker> but none of their songs
[13:31:02] <toddparker> that might be fine _|Nix|_
[13:31:19] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ on iPod Touch iOS 5.0.1
[13:31:19] <johnbender> gseguin: are you around?
[13:31:25] <toddparker> positioning relative to the window instead of the clicked thing might be a good idea
[13:31:29] <gseguin> 'sup johnbender ?
[13:31:31] <toddparker> at least as an option
[13:31:50] <johnbender> gseguin: you have part of the test suite running with phantom correct?
[13:31:51] <toddparker> for something dialog-esque, feels odd to open it like that
[13:31:52] <agcolom> docs popup page. touch form.
[13:31:53] <MauriceG> How cool is that?  I h
[13:32:12] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: The tooltip breaks the iPod because it has an invalid transition: "slidup" ...
[13:32:15] <johnbender> I'm attempting to get that working with grunt as a possible replacement for the build server tests that won't work with test swarm
[13:32:17] <toddparker> ha!
[13:32:22] <gseguin> At some point I checked and yeah I could run some tests
[13:32:22] <toddparker> operator error
[13:32:23] <agcolom> the popup comes and repositions itself right for me
[13:32:24] <toddparker> probably me
[13:33:11] <gseguin> johnbender: having trouble with it?
[13:33:17] <johnbender> gseguin: indeed
[13:33:22] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: http://jsbin.com/okehir/84
[13:33:23] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_:  yes. it is the tooltip ...
[13:33:30] <johnbender> gseguin: just getting started though so I'm wondering if  there's anything obvious that I'm missing
[13:33:43] <johnbender> gseguin: do you have your setup posted anywhere for inspection?
[13:33:54] <agcolom> but if I touch ouside, I get a back effect (i.e. the popup disappears and I go to the browser page that was there before I opened the docs page
[13:33:55] <_|Nix|_> MauriceG: It's broken because agcolom mispeled the word "slideup" - she wrote "slidup". I fixed it in http://jsbin.com/okehir/84
[13:34:00] <gseguin> johnbender: nope
[13:34:11] <gseguin> johnbender: what phantoms runner are you using?
[13:34:21] <gseguin> s/phantoms/phantomjs/
[13:34:32] <johnbender> gseguin: not sure what you mean
[13:34:35] <johnbender> gseguin: the version?
[13:34:47] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: That's an old problem.  Are you sure you're using the latest?
[13:34:55] <johnbender> or what am I using to invoke phantom
[13:35:16] <toddparker> does that bin point to the latest css and js
[13:35:22] <toddparker> or the old branch stuff
[13:35:35] <gseguin> phantomjs itself cannot run the QUnit test suite
[13:35:51] <johnbender> ?
[13:35:51] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[13:36:00] <gseguin> you need a script that will override the QUnit hooks
[13:36:10] <gseguin> that's what I call the runner
[13:36:16] <johnbender> ah
[13:36:19] <agcolom> yes I'm looking at jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html
[13:36:19] <gseguin> hold on, looking for a link'
[13:36:24] <agcolom> yes, that's the one
[13:36:28] <johnbender> gseguin: grunt makes it look like it's trivial but maybe I missed something
[13:36:29] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: OK ... not good ...
[13:36:34] <johnbender> gseguin: but this is why I asked
[13:36:36] <johnbender> :D
[13:36:37] <gseguin> johnbender: you should look at this: http://casperjs.org/
[13:36:40] <MauriceG> _|Nix|_:  okay. so I have to try to break it on the demos
[13:36:42] <agcolom> happens with any popup
[13:36:58] <gseguin> but there is something more basic, that I
[13:37:01] <agcolom> shall I try your site?
[13:37:03] <gseguin> 'm looking for
[13:37:36] <agcolom> MauriceG Are you seeing that too? Was not happening yesterday
[13:38:41] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Damn! ... and, again, can't reproduce it ...
[13:39:14] <johnbender> gseguin: ah, grunt injects it's own js
[13:39:21] <toddparker> what are the steps/url/device to test this issue?
[13:39:39] <gseguin> johnbender: oh ok
[13:39:45] <gseguin> so no need for a runner?
[13:39:56] <johnbender> gseguin: in theory this is the runner, right
[13:39:59] <MauriceG> agcolom:  mmh. what is yesterday? I did not see the sun ... :-). but possible..
[13:40:16] <gseguin> johnbender: I guess
[13:40:21] <gseguin> I don't know grunt
[13:40:23] <agcolom> Go to http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/popup/index.html touch a popup touch out popup goes and I get a browser "back" effecct
[13:40:31] * gseguin should really look at the guts of grunt
[13:40:34] <uGoMobi> 505 open issues... are we gonna make it under 500 today? :-)
[13:40:38] <johnbender> gseguin: yah I don't think this is going to work realy well
[13:40:41] <agcolom> (I get it with iPod Touch iOS 5.0.1
[13:40:44] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm sure it expects synch loading
[13:41:12] <toddparker> agcolom: what browser?
[13:41:18] <toddparker> oh, i see
[13:41:23] <toddparker> testing...
[13:41:28] <agcolom> ok
[13:41:36] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  think on the timezone we are!
[13:41:56] <gseguin> johnbender: for QUnit yes, to be able to override the QUnit hooks on domready but for the tests themselves it shouldn't matter
[13:41:58] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: still early ;-)
[13:42:16] <toddparker> all is working for me. iPhone 4S 5.1.1
[13:42:28] <toddparker> also ok on a Kindle Fire
[13:42:37] <toddparker> HTC Incredible (2.3)
[13:42:55] <agcolom> ok, will try on something else
[13:43:00] <johnbender> gseguin: right now it stops on "undefined" is not an object, which I'm taking to mean that something isn't yet defined which requires a property
[13:43:06] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  please take a look at #4373
[13:43:07] <johnbender> sadly the phantomjs output isn't much help
[13:43:35] <johnbender> or I should say the grunt output + phantomjs isn't much help
[13:43:55] <gseguin> johnbender: I can give it a try tomorrow
[13:44:28] <johnbender> gseguin: no worries I'm going to keep looking
[13:44:32] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yeah i saw that PR... i noticed a PR from Jason that does the same for checkbox/radio labels
[13:45:16] <MauriceG> is that not merged already?
[13:45:22] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: yes
[13:45:46] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: was just thinking that we should look into having that rule on one place
[13:45:50] <_|Nix|_> toddparker, agcolom: So, what's the upshot? Is there a problem with the history?
[13:45:58] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: with all selectors that it should apply too
[13:46:19] <toddparker> i can't repro
[13:46:27] <toddparker> _|Nix|_ and agcolom
[13:46:41] <MauriceG> mmh. yes.
[13:47:03] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: not sure we should, but just something we could check
[13:47:11] <agcolom> I've tried on iPAd iOS5.1 and all is fine... I'll shut down the browser on the iPod Touch and try again...
[13:47:18] <toddparker> ok
[13:47:25] <toddparker> ICS is crazy slow to open these popups
[13:47:28] <toddparker> like 5 seconds
[13:47:33] <_|Nix|_> Yuck!
[13:47:34] <toddparker> bt 2.3 is similar to iOS
[13:47:51] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... even the no-transition one?
[13:48:03] <toddparker> no transition = 5 seconds
[13:48:11] <_|Nix|_> *gasp*
[13:48:14] <toddparker> pop = 9 seconds
[13:48:24] <toddparker> (close is equally slow)
[13:48:34] <toddparker> slideup= 7 seconds
[13:48:39] <_|Nix|_> WTF could it be doing?
[13:48:42] <toddparker> this is on a brand new galaxy nexus
[13:48:43] <agcolom> iOS 5.1, iPad i get the popup then the overlay arrives and the popup is repositioned then when the popup goes it gets redrawn a 3rd time...
[13:48:53] <agcolom> iPad 1 iOS 5.1
[13:49:13] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Which popup?
[13:49:14] <toddparker> runnin 4.0.4
[13:49:25] <agcolom> form popup
[13:49:42] <toddparker> nobody ever said mobile was easy
[13:49:42] <agcolom> default: fine
[13:49:49] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Wouldn't be surprised. The transitions aren't always smooth ...
[13:49:53] <agcolom> tooltip fine
[13:50:03] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: Especially those that move things a lot.
[13:50:09] <agcolom> menu fine
[13:50:11] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: The form is jerky even on my laptop ...
[13:50:25] <agcolom> photo: fine
[13:50:26] <_|Nix|_> agcolom: I think that's just a transition performance issue.
[13:51:07] <agcolom> dialog, accordion: fine
[13:51:08] <_|Nix|_> I think ima hit the hay for tonight ... L8R all!
[13:51:23] <agcolom> goodnight
[13:52:07] <MauriceG> bye night!
[13:52:20] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ now the form popup looks better...
[13:53:08] <agcolom> _|Nix|_ restarting my Safari browser on hte iPod Touch fixed my previous problem
[13:54:02] <MauriceG> iphone landscape issue top!  just the auto go back now.
[13:55:40] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: is this still an issue? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4316
[13:55:40] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4316 on jquery-mobile (MauriceG; 2w, 9h ago): showPageLoadingMsg() is not working
[13:55:45] <johnbender> gseguin: working
[13:55:47] <johnbender> alright
[13:55:48] <johnbender> this is good
[13:56:04] <gseguin> johnbender: w00t!
[13:56:32] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: just created a fiddle for that spinner-lover-guy and the function works
[13:57:07] <MauriceG> cool!
[13:59:35] <MauriceG> #4316. still an issue. With 1.1 style coding you get no text
[14:00:08] <MauriceG> what I say ... 1.0 coding
[14:01:21] <MauriceG> my whole application is without commit message this time :-( ..
[14:02:18] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ok I see... error message should always display text
[14:02:44] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  yes
[14:04:18] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  Kannst Du auch ein bischen Deutsch?  just to know...
[14:05:03] <uGoMobi> nur ein bisschen (double s!)
[14:05:22] <uGoMobi> und Umlaut auf nur
[14:05:42] <uGoMobi> aber ich weiss nicht wie ich das mache (?)
[14:07:04] <MauriceG> we put the &szlig; away for words like bißchen.  and nur without ü ... sehr gut Jasper.  1+, sit down
[14:07:22] <MauriceG> :-)
[14:07:25] <uGoMobi> :-)
[14:38:31] <johnbender> gseguin: I'm really really really liking this
[14:38:54] <johnbender> I might take the time to write a snippet to dump the results into junit xml format
[14:39:02] <johnbender> so we can integrate it with jenkins properly
[14:40:21] <agcolom> I'm done for today... Goodnight everyone
[14:41:04] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[14:41:12] <agcolom> toddparker: Have you heard of hyperlab?
[14:41:14] <uGoMobi> toddparker: you still here?
[14:41:18] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper
[14:41:19] <gseguin> johnbender: I have a runner that outputs junit xml
[14:41:40] <MauriceG> good night Anne, sleep well and have sweet dreams!
[14:41:41] <johnbender> gseguin: ah nice
[14:41:52] <gseguin> let me send that to you, it might need some work to work with phantomjs >= 1.3
[14:41:56] <gseguin> but it's a base
[14:42:44] <johnbender> gseguin: yep
[14:43:03] <agcolom> Goodnight Maurice :-) same to you :-)
[14:43:08] * gseguin finds it
[14:43:33] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/PX6yJQ
[14:43:33] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] qunit with phantom setup - John Bender
[14:48:20] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  I had another look at #4373 and theme.css is not the right place for it as checkbosradio.css also. may we ask for a nevermind.css ...
[14:49:19] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I agree checkboxradio rule shouldnt be in theme.css. I was more thinking about having one rule in button.css
[14:50:17] <uGoMobi> at the other end... there are more rules that could be combined but are repeated for every widget
[14:50:17] <MauriceG> for buttons and radio/checkboxes?
[14:51:25] <gseguin> johnbender: emailed
[14:51:25] <uGoMobi> button.css is base css for all kind of buttons including checkbox/radio
[14:51:29] <toddparker> i'm here guys
[14:51:38] <toddparker> sorry, stepped out
[14:52:07] <uGoMobi> toddparker: welcome back, already asked my question in a comment... until when do we keep supporting jQuery 1.6.4?
[14:52:17] <MauriceG> (to have an oomlet). ;-)
[14:52:18] <toddparker> good question
[14:52:21] <toddparker> at least until 1.2
[14:52:21] <uGoMobi> asking because of examples for the docs
[14:52:38] <toddparker> the general rule is we should support latest + 1 version back
[14:52:45] <uGoMobi> need to show two versions of code... live() for 1.6.4. and on() for 1.7.1
[14:52:51] <toddparker> so when 1.8 drops, we can support 1.8 and 1.7
[14:53:04] <uGoMobi> i see
[14:53:31] <toddparker> for the docs, you could just note what version the code is designed for and say "on 1.6.x, you need to use foo"
[14:53:40] <toddparker> use 1.7.x
[14:54:02] <uGoMobi> ok
[15:00:15] <Wilto> You guys. YOU GUYS.
[15:00:33] <MauriceG> oohps.  yes sir ...
[15:00:45] <Wilto> 504 issues.
[15:00:51] <Wilto> You are heroes.
[15:01:00] <MauriceG> need fresh underware, sorry ...
[15:02:15] <gseguin> johnbender: my email got blocked by your firewall
[15:02:22] <johnbender> gseguin: yah :(
[15:02:23] <Wilto> And we were at like 50 PRs a couple days ago, yeah?
[15:02:39] <gseguin> gisting it
[15:03:20] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  say something ..
[15:03:40] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: ??
[15:04:18] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  I mean the red one is watching .
[15:04:26] <uGoMobi> lol
[15:06:04] <gseguin> johnbender: https://gist.github.com/2771964
[15:06:24] <johnbender> gseguin: nice
[15:06:25] <johnbender> thanks
[15:06:26] <MauriceG> not lol ...  say something else.  make him pleased. (tevregen)
[15:06:38] <gseguin> you're welcome
[15:07:06] <toddparker> the red one, eh?
[15:07:49] <MauriceG> hush!
[15:08:39] <MauriceG> is he away ?
[15:11:51] <agcolom> toddparker: I think this is ref to Red Leader (aka wilto) (am i correct) Sorry I am supposed to be in bed... really going in a minute ;-)
[15:12:03] <Wilto> All this productivity has sated my overwhelming rage. FOR NOW
[15:12:41] <toddparker> his ego can't stand that much power
[15:12:46] <Wilto> Seriously though: awesome work.
[15:13:47] <agcolom> wilto: good :-) but why rage? that's not good for you... or is it??  (honestly cannot remember)
[15:14:04] <toddparker> Wilto eats rage for lunch
[15:14:22] <uGoMobi> i hate it when people open an issue and then disappear from github for months and never answer our questions!
[15:14:28] <agcolom> ahhh... are you two in the same office?
[15:14:39] <MauriceG> a red without rage is not a red
[15:15:05] <toddparker> yep
[15:16:01] <MauriceG> he gives the power to keep the eyes open even if the tear drops rolls
[15:17:18] <toddparker> yeah, well we can be more aggressive about closing issues like that uGoMobi
[15:17:47] <toddparker> actually, what I really want is to have us all follow up within 24 hours when a new ticket comes in
[15:18:01] <toddparker> nail down the steps to reproduce, platform, test peg, etc.
[15:18:02] <uGoMobi> i totally agree
[15:18:14] <toddparker> some of this is i fell way behind on triage
[15:18:26] <agcolom> that must be great fun! sorry quick acronym question, what does IMA stand for? (or is it MIA?) I got the impression it meant being away....
[15:18:37] <toddparker> there is still a chunk in the middle form 2-3 months ago that still haven't been read
[15:18:39] <uGoMobi> Missing in Action
[15:18:54] <toddparker> ya
[15:19:07] <MauriceG> The red one has uGoMobi already in his excommunication
[15:19:24] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: did i miss anything
[15:19:25] <uGoMobi> ?
[15:19:28] <agcolom> Thks! When I searched I got Miami International Airport... Didn't really work ;-)
[15:19:39] <MauriceG> no no ...
[15:19:41] <toddparker> so let's all try to swam any new issues that come in, close the junk and get them all tagged with a priority and good test info
[15:20:04] <toddparker> we can keep digging away at the backlog in parallel
[15:20:36] <agcolom> yes, that's usually works well. and we need to ask for test case straight away if that's not provided...
[15:20:48] <toddparker> it's been fantastic having agcolom, uGoMobi and MauriceG on the scene - thanks all
[15:21:07] <uGoMobi> and then he left
[15:21:43] <uGoMobi> toddparker: thanks and it feels good to be part of the team
[15:21:47] <toddparker> keep an eye out for more people active in the docs that we trust
[15:22:12] <toddparker> another person or two would help us really work down our workload
[15:22:18] <toddparker> thank you uGoMobi
[15:23:24] <toddparker> a few people that are active: eugenebond, daAtog (already here sometimes), adammessenger, frequent, etc.
[15:23:41] <MauriceG> toddparker:  Thank very much. Very nice to hear something in the middle of the night (+6)
[15:23:50] <toddparker> just keep your eyes peeled and try to encourage people to help out if they look sharp
[15:25:05] <toddparker> i feel like we have a good critical mass now with johnbender, gseguin _|Nix|_ doing more of the heavy duty dev and a bunch of us focusing on the design, docs, triage, etc. - lots of things to do
[15:25:24] <johnbender> word
[15:25:30] <toddparker> anyway, we're humming along. i'm a happy camper.
[15:25:35] <johnbender> specialization
[15:25:38] <toddparker> yep
[15:26:38] <agcolom> thx :-) and this time I am going to bed ;-) goodnight everyone again...
[15:26:46] <toddparker> JasonDScott: you have time for a bug fixing binge?
[15:26:52] <toddparker> g'night agcolom
[15:27:11] <uGoMobi> goodnight (again) Anne
[15:27:47] <agcolom> my problem is I have to be up in 7h!
[15:28:26] <MauriceG> ah, so you say:  g'night Anne, sleep well and may do not dream about jqm (like usual :-)
[15:28:54] <toddparker> JasonDScott: this one needs some attention - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3949
[15:28:55] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3949 on jquery-mobile (dbeuning; 1m, 2w ago): taptoggle feature, turns headers into footers
[15:29:35] <toddparker> actually, uGoMobi - is this a dupe of another issue? this is where the source order flips w/fixed
[15:29:37] <MauriceG> agcolom:  you've one hour more ...
[15:29:48] <toddparker> or MauriceG  ^^
[15:30:03] <uGoMobi> toddparker: will take a look
[15:30:21] <MauriceG> thanks uGoMobi  ...
[15:30:56] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ah yes, just saw three other issues like that ... content - header - footer
[15:31:28] <uGoMobi> almost created a "flipped content" label ;-)
[15:31:52] <toddparker> heh
[15:32:01] <uGoMobi> toddparker: going to reference the other issues
[15:32:15] <toddparker> maybe you can help consolidate some of these issues. we have a bunch of cases where there are dupes
[15:32:18] <toddparker> yeah
[15:32:23] <uGoMobi> can easily find them with fixed toolbars label :-)
[15:32:26] <toddparker> cool
[15:32:34] <uGoMobi> toddparker: look what i just found.... https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4025
[15:32:34] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4025 on jquery-mobile (JonathanAquino; 1m, 1w ago): Fennec 4.0.1: Links don't work (jQuery Mobile 1.1.0-rc.1)
[15:32:36] <toddparker> been seeing lots of useful labels in there
[15:32:44] <toddparker> heh
[15:33:10] <toddparker> i think we can close that and say we're supporting new versions but that was so buggy
[15:33:13] <uGoMobi> looks like i am not the only one who noticed... issue describes blank pages just like i saw
[15:33:26] <uGoMobi> i will comment and close
[15:33:55] <toddparker> really want to get this slide change event in for 1.2 - it keeps coming up
[15:34:01] <toddparker> assigned to JasonDScott - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/1589
[15:34:02] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #1589 on jquery-mobile (tenor; 1y, 2w ago): Feature Request: Slider Change Event
[15:34:19] <toddparker> uGoMobi: you've been referencing like a machine
[15:34:37] <uGoMobi> why?
[15:34:48] <toddparker> why add that?
[15:35:17] <uGoMobi> huh? add what?
[15:35:17] <toddparker> or referencing? that was a compliment!
[15:35:33] <toddparker> add that slider change event
[15:35:36] <uGoMobi> haha ok thanks
[15:35:43] <toddparker> sorry for the confusion
[15:35:55] <toddparker> re: ignoring mini on listviews
[15:35:56] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4114
[15:35:57] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4114 on jquery-mobile (uGoMobi; 1m, 3d ago): Listview data-mini="true" should be ignored
[15:36:07] <toddparker> did you land that part of your PR
[15:36:21] <uGoMobi> no not yet
[15:36:25] <toddparker> ok, np
[15:36:28] <toddparker> just curious
[15:36:32] <uGoMobi> you mean disable it in JS right?
[15:36:54] <uGoMobi> have made the changes... but didnt test yet
[15:37:07] <toddparker> yeah, if the attr is there, just ignore it
[15:37:33] <toddparker> be good to have you help us identify the big emerging issues in the tracker so we can focus on those
[15:37:45] <toddparker> been seeing a bunch of fixed + padding issues
[15:37:46] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4114
[15:37:47] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #4114 on jquery-mobile (uGoMobi; 1m, 3d ago): Listview data-mini="true" should be ignored
[15:37:56] <uGoMobi> well it's more like that it has been added to listview.js on purpose... so had remove things
[15:38:14] <toddparker> right
[15:38:23] <uGoMobi> yeah updatePagePadding and fixed toolbars are popular
[15:38:39] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/search?q=updatePagePadding
[15:38:56] <toddparker> 8 open items
[15:39:14] <toddparker> sheesh
[15:40:25] <uGoMobi> i think it might help if we change margin to padding on ui-title
[15:40:37] <uGoMobi> going to check that
[15:40:47] <toddparker> if uGoMobi and MauriceG focused on helping to connect the dots, that would help with triage. Find the 8 issues, boil it down to the real issue root then we can tackle a fix
[15:41:11] <toddparker> the title = header?
[15:41:40] <uGoMobi> heading in the title
[15:41:45] <uGoMobi> sorry...
[15:41:54] <uGoMobi> title/heading in the header
[15:41:58] <toddparker> there are probably a few things going on
[15:42:00] <uGoMobi> (getting late here)
[15:42:13] <toddparker> 1. seems like the initial padding in the CSS may be off by a few pixels for a typical header
[15:42:31] <toddparker> 2. the timing/triggers for this may not work in all situations
[15:42:39] <toddparker> etc.
[15:42:45] <uGoMobi> yes indeed
[15:43:27] <toddparker> that's why some of this is reading through 'em all and figuring out all the issues at once. you are a very patient and thorough guy
[15:43:33] <toddparker> :)
[15:44:08] <toddparker> well, i think we need to put padding on the content, no? the header is absolute positioned
[15:44:10] <uGoMobi> just gathering all the info and than act
[15:44:13] <toddparker> yeah
[15:44:17] <uGoMobi> thats why i like labels
[15:44:47] <toddparker> well, feel free to come up with whatever system makes you productive. that's why you're a committer - you can do what you need now
[15:45:01] <toddparker> if you want to add a ton of label,s go for it
[15:45:07] <toddparker> tracker is pretty primitive
[15:45:20] <toddparker> ok, heading home. see you all tomorrow!
[15:45:24] <uGoMobi> maybe we should change the topics of issue more often as well as soon as we see it doesnt really match/describe the content
[15:45:24] <toddparker> 'night
[15:45:31] <toddparker> sure, good idea
[15:45:36] <toddparker> use them as trending topics
[15:45:43] <toddparker> then delete once we fix it
[15:45:46] <toddparker> ++1
[15:45:50] <uGoMobi> toddparker: ok good evening
[15:47:30] <MauriceG> cu uGoMobi  ( the machine )
[15:47:46] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: good night!
[15:48:02] <MauriceG> gute Nacht! :-)
[15:50:29] <MauriceG> good evening toddparker  thanks again.  it seems you're a great in motivation.
