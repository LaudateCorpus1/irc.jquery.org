[12:39:55] <kinblas> both
[12:40:03] <kinblas> because I might need to lookup the attribute
[12:40:57] <kinblas> johnbender: checkout  that jsperf url above
[12:41:00] <kinblas> to see the difference
[12:49:16] <johnbender> kinblas: so does the current caching now work for both, from eyeballing it - it appears that it should cache both the camel case and the dashed versions
[12:49:20] <johnbender> fully realizing you wrote it
[12:50:02] <kinblas> johnbender: the current caching only caches prop-to-namespaced-camelcase-prop
[12:50:20] <kinblas> I need another cache for prop-to-namespaced-attribute-name
[12:58:29] <Wilto> Mango, Mango, Mango. You saucy minx.
[12:59:31] <Wilto> The issue is opacity in conjunction with… Things.
[12:59:40] <Wilto> opacity: .5; top: 0; works fine.
[12:59:48] <Wilto> opacity: .5; left: 0; does not.
[12:59:53] <Wilto> Go figure.
[13:02:20] <johnbender> Wilto: hmm, I tried playing around with both of those
[13:02:29] <Wilto> This is insane, man.
[13:02:38] <johnbender> Wilto: no more insane than the related android issues
[13:02:51] <Wilto> No question.
[13:03:00] <johnbender> we're using a fully transparent select menu, it's also partly our own fault
[13:03:17] <johnbender> though I can't, for the life of me, figure out how we would implement that otherwise
[13:03:38] <Wilto> No, I honestly think this is a great little approach.
[13:03:45] <Wilto> I mean, all things considered, it works really well.
[13:06:17] * gseguin is catching up
[13:13:40] <eddiemonge> isnt there an issue with appcache not working?
[13:15:45] <johnbender> eddiemonge: there is, but it's not something we can fix
[13:15:55] <johnbender> eddiemonge: are you intetested in the particulars?
[13:16:04] <johnbender> todd linked to it a short while ago

[13:17:08] <eddiemonge> yeah i liked the "java" part too
[13:17:29] <eddiemonge> "looks like" not that it actually was
[13:18:31] <Wilto> oh my head
[13:25:01] <johnbender> Wilto: that select issue is beyond weird
[13:25:07] <johnbender> I spent _days_ on it
[13:25:16] <johnbender> and couldn't find anything workable
[13:26:13] <Wilto> I might have found something.
[13:26:24] <Wilto> It ain’t pretty, and I ain’t proud.
[13:34:35] <toddmparker_> hope it works
[13:42:35] <Wilto> Even the phone’s battery is against me.
[13:42:43] <Wilto> We will know whether it works in a few minutes, I guess.

[13:52:32] <gseguin> I may have missed the discussion about it
[13:52:51] <gseguin> and I don't see any issue for that PR
[13:53:14] <gseguin> what's the plan, why do we need to do that?
[13:53:29] <eddiemonge> match core and UI
[13:53:48] <gseguin> oh ok
[13:57:13] <eddiemonge> i think im still waiting on toddmparker_ for that one
[13:57:14] <johnbender> eddiemonge: as far as the makefile changes you added, will that affect the nightlies etc?
[13:57:26] <eddiemonge> johnbender: yeah but in a good way
[13:57:37] <eddiemonge> make them easier to do
[13:59:54] <eddiemonge> make nightly; done!
[14:00:03] <eddiemonge> make latest; done!
[14:00:07] <johnbender> eddiemonge: meaning if I merge it right now will you be able to get everything set up so we don't see a hiccup?
[14:00:09] <eddiemonge> make deploy; boom
[14:00:17] <toddmparker_> johnbender: don't want to jinx us, but we might have fixed that mango select issue
[14:00:18] <eddiemonge> johnbender: already all setup for it
[14:00:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: zomg
[14:00:30] <toddmparker_> you don't even want to know the fix
[14:00:31] <eddiemonge> make the changes last night
[14:00:35] <johnbender> eddiemonge: brilliant I'll merge that in then
[14:00:51] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: oh one other piece of good infra news
[14:01:03] <toddmparker_> this is nothing a sane developer like yourself would try
[14:01:09] <toddmparker_> yeah eddiemonge?
[14:01:11] <gseguin> johnbender, eddiemonge: does the latest PR depend on the previous one?
[14:01:17] <eddiemonge> demo/ and demos/ now point correctly, no updating anything necessary
[14:02:05] <eddiemonge> gseguin: depending on the order they go in, they may cause conflicts
[14:02:24] <eddiemonge> if the makefile one lands first, the license one needs to change to drop the makefile from it
[14:02:48] <gseguin> ok, johnbender you want to take care of that, I'll move on to other PR ?
[14:02:56] <johnbender> eddiemonge: did the CSSTHEME env variable survive your changes?
[14:03:23] <eddiemonge> johnbender: i changed it to just THEME
[14:03:33] <johnbender> eddiemonge: does the README need an update too then?
[14:04:11] <eddiemonge> yeah. there are two references in it
[14:04:30] <johnbender> gseguin: what other pull request are you referring to?
[14:05:34] <Wilto> …I think I fixed selects in Mango.
[14:06:40] <eddiemonge> ...by destroying all Mango phones?
[14:06:40] <Wilto> but at what cost to my mortal soul
[14:06:53] <johnbender> Wilto: I'll be interested to see this
[14:08:54] <Wilto> Oh, no you won’t.

[14:13:31] <ryanneufeld> Hi eddiemonge I'm happy to talk about it, or at least explain where my solution stemmed from
[14:15:54] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: i can understand how it would work but there are too many cases where it fails

[14:18:14] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: the site I needed this for is http://m.metrolyrics.com/ we use the listview  to display images with multiple lines of content
[14:18:26] <johnbender> gseguin: ah, I think we should merge the first one in before the second one eh?
[14:18:29] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: the idea was to replicate some behaviour from an earlier alpha version.
[14:18:49] <gseguin> that's what I was thinking
[14:19:37] <johnbender> gseguin: did you look at the license one closely?
[14:20:04] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: to make the artist name go under the number or under the words
[14:20:34] <gseguin> johnbender: it looks pretty straight forward
[14:20:45] <gseguin> added 3 files

[14:20:55] <johnbender> wow
[14:20:58] <johnbender> that's scary lol
[14:21:09] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: if you're looking at the site, the top 10 songs. We have the number beside the first line
[14:21:27] <Wilto> Oh ho ho YES SON.
[14:21:30] <ryanneufeld> without the fix I made, the numbers appear above.
[14:21:31] <Wilto> SELECTS WORK IN MANGO
[14:21:33] <gseguin> lol
[14:21:48] <johnbender> do they break anywhere else?

[14:21:49] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[14:21:50] <gseguin> johnbender: and replaced head with cat

[14:22:49] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: that would be helpful
[14:22:55] <eddiemonge> johnbender: whats scary?
[14:22:56] <johnbender> gseguin: alright one sec
[14:23:02] <johnbender> eddiemonge: the intro outro stuff
[14:23:07] <toddmparker_> The fix is so clean, so simple, but makes no sense
[14:23:11] <johnbender> those are only for builds right?
[14:23:42] <johnbender> crazytown
[14:23:45] <Wilto> (Bear with me on the exposition; I’ve read a lot of Sherlock Holmes.)
[14:23:46] <Wilto> opacity: 0 doesn’t work. opacity: inherit works, but not if there’s an opacity: 0 to inherit.
[14:24:16] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: is there cdn for jquery mobile?
[14:24:19] <Wilto> opacity: [any numeric value] breaks.
[14:24:25] <Wilto> opacity: fhdjslfhdjlsk; did not.
[14:24:36] <eddiemonge> johnbender: yeah but i added references for it to the php that goes through combined as well
[14:24:43] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: yeah
[14:25:07] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: see http://code.jquery.com/index.html
[14:25:10] <Wilto> It turns out: whenever it tries to calculate a numeric opacity—including an inherited one—without explicitly specifying an opacity value on the parent to give it context, the bug appeared.
[14:25:26] <ryanneufeld> thx
[14:25:32] <Wilto> ui-select .ui-btn { opacity: 1; }
[14:25:32] <Wilto> .ui-select .ui-btn select { […] opacity: 0; }
[14:25:35] <Wilto> And we’re golden.
[14:25:40] * gseguin doesn't like this PHP business, we should do it in JS
[14:25:43] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/2VJ6n/
[14:26:16] <eddiemonge> gseguin: its still the same. install node or install php
[14:26:23] <eddiemonge> brb
[14:26:57] <gseguin> eddiemonge: but node understands JavaScript, PHP doesn't
[14:29:33] <gseguin> eddiemonge: and that would mean just needing an HTTP server for dev (no need of PHP)
[14:30:09] <gseguin> anyways that's not happening in 1.0
[14:30:13] <johnbender> eddiemonge: and with php because it can't run standalone like node or ruby it requires an apache install
[14:30:33] <johnbender>  not proposing ruby
[14:33:10] <gseguin> johnbender: git question for you
[14:33:25] <gseguin> I'm in a branch, I want to take an update from master
[14:33:31] <gseguin> rebase or merge?
[14:35:43] <johnbender> gseguin: how long has the branch existed
[14:35:51] <johnbender> have you updated master already from origin?
[14:36:00] <johnbender> that second question is important either way
[14:36:12] <gseguin> not too long
[14:36:25] <johnbender> I would do a `git fetch; git rebase origin/master`
[14:36:26] <gseguin> yes master is updated
[14:36:54] <gseguin> in my case it's upstream/master
[14:37:01] <johnbender> gseguin: kk
[14:37:05] <gseguin> cool
[14:37:06] <gseguin> thanks
[14:38:10] <Wilto> oh look at that it’s BEER TIME
[14:38:44] <gseguin> johnbender: well that didn't go very well
[14:38:46] <gseguin> :P
[14:40:12] <johnbender> gseguin: what happened?
[14:40:22] <gseguin> it rid my changes
[14:40:30] <gseguin> (the amd ones)
[14:40:36] <johnbender> gseguin: no it didn't
[14:40:42] <eddiemonge> ok back

[14:40:51] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: wb
[14:40:52] <johnbender> was there a conflict?
[14:41:08] <eddiemonge> i agree getting rid of php would be good but until a better solution is found, its a postpone solution
[14:41:09] <gseguin> no conflict
[14:41:42] <gseguin> eddiemonge: agreed, working on a better solution
[14:42:08] <johnbender> gseguin gimme a quick minute and I'll help you out
[14:42:40] <gseguin> johnbender: don't worry I'll just re-fetch from my origin (jqm fork)
[14:44:37] <johnbender> gseguin: skype screenshare?
[14:44:47] <gseguin> sure
[14:45:09] * gseguin starts skype
[14:46:47] <eddiemonge> ryanneufeld: looks like ui-li-heading should be display inline-block instead of block
[14:47:16] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: hmm, k
[14:47:57] <ryanneufeld> that does seem to solve it
[14:48:18] <ryanneufeld> and I'll bet is a much better solution than the hair brained hack i made :p
[14:48:20] <eddiemonge> im not sure what else that would affect though
[14:48:31] <eddiemonge> that would be a toddmparker_ Wilto question
[14:50:01] <eddiemonge> johnbender: gseguin any other questions about either PR?
[14:51:14] <gseguin> I don't, it's in johnbender's hands now ;)
[14:53:19] <johnbender> eddiemonge: did you want to update the server pull request with the readme change
[14:53:22] <johnbender> ?
[14:54:14] <eddiemonge> johnbender: i guess i could. or i could do a separate one
[14:54:48] <Wilto> Uh oh. What’s up?
[14:54:56] <Wilto> Who’s got hacks? Love me some hacks.
[14:55:39] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: I do! I do!
[14:56:03] <ryanneufeld> I mean *cough* yo, sup?
[14:56:59] <eddiemonge> johnbender: ok added
[14:57:17] <johnbender> eddiemonge: if you update the branch that you submitted the pull request from it will update automatically (eddiemonge:server)
[14:57:32] <johnbender> eddiemonge: beat me to it :D
[14:58:31] <Wilto> Just a heads-up: if it comes down to a hack vs. inline-block: I have “INLNE BLOCK” tattooed across my knuckles.
[14:58:41] <Wilto> I have an intense love for display: inline-block;
[14:59:01] <eddiemonge> i just wish ie6 did too
[14:59:14] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: no one cares about ie6, at least we don't :p
[14:59:21] <Wilto> Therein lies the beauty!
[14:59:29] <johnbender> eddiemonge: does that intro file need to be added to the makefile?
[14:59:38] <Wilto> display: inline; in 6/7 is nigh identical to the implementation of display: inline-block; in the grown-up browsers.
[15:00:19] <ryanneufeld> Wilto: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/2VJ6n/3/
[15:00:42] <ryanneufeld> that's a sample of our html/css with the latest jqm

[15:01:44] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by ryanneufeld (1m, 1w ago): Bug 1609; detect if list view is multi line and add additional class to a
[15:02:40] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: it was a hack I put in place to get it launched. Something changed between one of the alphas and the RC, that changed how list items were dealt with
[15:03:25] <johnbender> eddiemonge: sorry from the license pull
[15:03:40] <toddmparker_> hmmm
[15:04:04] <toddmparker_> sorry, this seems like a big enough change that we should probably hold off
[15:04:21] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: m.metrolyrics.com is the live site at the moment, with my pull request added to it.
[15:04:23] <toddmparker_> we're trying to speed up lists and this seems like it could add overhead
[15:04:29] <eddiemonge> johnbender: thats where it was initiall added. i copied it to the server pr as well
[15:04:54] <toddmparker_> and the difference is just inline-block instead of block?
[15:05:00] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: seems to be now
[15:05:49] <ryanneufeld> although if you look here: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/2VJ6n/4/
[15:06:06] <ryanneufeld> the list items seem to be styled quite differently.
[15:06:35] <toddmparker_> i'm just not sure what ripples this could cause
[15:06:47] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: yeah, reject my pull for sure
[15:06:48] <toddmparker_> multi-line is kind of an odd name
[15:07:12] <toddmparker_> this is more about there being multiple elements inside, not that they necessarily wrap to multiple lines (vs. truncating)
[15:07:30] <ryanneufeld> kinda yeah
[15:08:33] <ryanneufeld> that's part of it
[15:08:38] <ryanneufeld> honestly it was so long ago I
[15:08:54] <ryanneufeld> am having trouble remembering the exact symptoms we had
[15:09:01] <toddmparker_> i think having this workaround in the tracker is great
[15:09:22] <toddmparker_> i just worry that people expect to not need to write any css
[15:09:54] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: if that's the case, it needs to be documented in clear big letters
[15:10:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I would prefer that was the solution
[15:10:10] <ryanneufeld> the impression given is that it's a "drop in"
[15:10:12] <toddmparker_> what, that css may be needed?
[15:10:17] <ryanneufeld> sure
[15:10:18] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:10:24] <toddmparker_> it is, for the specific patterns we happen to have
[15:10:31] <toddmparker_> but everyone has different list needs
[15:10:33] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[15:10:46] <toddmparker_> we'd go crazy building every possible permutation
[15:10:49] <johnbender> and it's not hard to make the argument that we already overreach in the things we support
[15:10:58] <ryanneufeld> I agree
[15:10:58] <toddmparker_> heh
[15:11:15] <toddmparker_> jQM works so well with defaults that people want it to do the dishes for 'em
[15:11:36] <toddmparker_> every page should say "It's CSS, write some too"
[15:11:49] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: yeah, and when it doesn't there isn't a lot of "hey buddy what do you think I am" coming back from jqm
[15:11:59] <toddmparker_> that is why i've been resting adding more listview patterns
[15:12:02] <ryanneufeld> for me going through the docs is a frustrating experience

[15:12:21] <toddmparker_> i got pushed to support forms but trying to not go overboard
[15:12:42] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: the thing is when you have two forms of lists
[15:12:56] <ryanneufeld> it's easily assumed that the combination of them would be supported

[15:14:04] <eddiemonge> gseguin: actually it is wrong
[15:14:16] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: I also understand where you're coming from with the not wanting to support the moon too, and it's hard to say no
[15:14:18] <eddiemonge> my fiddle, not the pr
[15:14:20] <toddmparker_> ryanneufeld: what's frustrating in the docs we can patch up
[15:14:33] <ryanneufeld> just finding anything honestly
[15:14:36] <toddmparker_> most of the list stuff is just a few classes and css
[15:14:53] <toddmparker_> you could easily add a clas to the ul and write some extra rules against that
[15:15:05] <toddmparker_> yeah, i'm hoping to get search in there
[15:15:21] <gseguin> oh ok, so you've tested the PR?
[15:15:24] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I didn't understand your last comment in response to my question about the makefile
[15:15:31] <toddmparker_> if you have ideas on how t better organize, i'm all ears
[15:15:32] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: that would be one thing that it really needs
[15:15:50] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: I'll take notes next time i'm in there and file some bugs :)
[15:15:51] <toddmparker_> it's hard to describe a UI library
[15:15:54] <toddmparker_> ok
[15:16:33] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: it's hard to communicate "Im frustrated" in a constructive way that isn't me whinging on about how you've wronged me in some way :p
[15:16:44] <eddiemonge> johnbender: i didnt understant the question that my last comment was in response to about the makefile
[15:16:51] <johnbender> eddiemonge: lol
[15:17:03] <eddiemonge> gseguin: it does work i believe but its a lot of overhead added
[15:17:08] <johnbender> eddiemonge: doees the intro js file need to be included in the js file list ?
[15:17:28] <johnbender> eddiemonge: in the makefile that is
[15:18:11] <toddmparker_> we're open to input
[15:18:26] <toddmparker_> we add stuff every day to the docs, it's an ongoing thing
[15:18:27] <eddiemonge> johnbender: for the normal files it does. for the min files it doesnt. unless all files have the minified license link, which i think may not be optimal
[15:18:38] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: yeah, I know. :) I've had a PR accepted before
[15:18:45] <gseguin> k
[15:19:00] <ryanneufeld> I think it's fantastic that you're taking the time to have this conversation with me at all honestly
[15:19:05] <johnbender> eddiemonge: also I was thinking it seems odd to have *.js file in the php lists concat scripts for css
[15:19:38] <ryanneufeld> I'm pretty sure I met johnbender and toddmparker_ face to face at jqcon in SF this year... might have been scott jehl too
[15:20:42] <Wilto> DAMMIT SCOTT
[15:20:56] <Wilto> Oh, sorry, thought we were blaming him for stuff.
[15:21:22] <johnbender> Wilto: if you sorted out that mango bug you might want to submit a bug report to MS, though I have no idea where you would do that
[15:21:29] <johnbender> it's not exactly an open project :/
[15:21:39] <Wilto> I don’t know if I could even fully make sense of it to them.
[15:21:47] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: I'm going to be migrating our mobile site to a CodeIgniter framework in the coming weeks, so I'll be updating to latest jqm at the same time. I'll keep notes and make tickets if I find stuff that could use improvement
[15:22:08] <eddiemonge> johnbender: if you wants, i could change the extension for the intro.js but its just a text file and php isnt actually rendering it, just reading
[15:22:15] <toddmparker_> sounds good ryanneufeld
[15:22:30] <toddmparker_> feel free to edit the docs with better info and such as pulls
[15:22:32] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah I was thinking just take the extension off
[15:22:42] * johnbender is picking nits
[15:23:01] <ryanneufeld> toddmparker_: will do
[15:23:13] <ryanneufeld> I might pester some people here for help with git ect
[15:23:17] <ryanneufeld> I'm still a noob though
[15:23:22] <johnbender> eddiemonge: as for the makefile is that change in the license pull?
[15:23:58] <eddiemonge> johnbender: it uses intro as well but if the server pull goes through ill need to update the license pull to not have either the intro or the makefile changes
[15:24:13] <eddiemonge> but if the license goes through then server then both are good as is
[15:24:31] <johnbender> eddiemonge: I was thinking of doing the license first since that seems to expect the current makefile
[15:24:37] <eddiemonge> but changing license is a quick change
[15:24:49] <eddiemonge> johnbender: that would be optimal
[15:24:52] <johnbender> eddiemonge: but if you'd like me to the the server pull request I'm ready to do that one now
[15:25:03] <eddiemonge> wait i think ive said optimal too many times today already
[15:25:18] <eddiemonge> ?g synonym for optimal
[15:25:19] <bot-t> eddiemonge, Optimum Synonyms, Optimum Antonyms | Thesaurus.com - http://thesaurus.com/browse/optimum
[15:25:26] <ryanneufeld> eddiemonge: would it have been the optimal amount?
[15:25:53] <johnbender> eddiemonge: so are you going to add the intro to the makefile first?
[15:25:58] <eddiemonge> johnbender's comments are wonky and my vocabulary is as well
[15:26:18] <johnbender> or should I just merge both (license first) and then let you make the changes in another pr
[15:26:22] <eddiemonge> johnbender: umm pull in license then check to see if there is a conflict in server
[15:26:33] <eddiemonge> i like how my pr's now have names instead of numbers
[15:27:06] <eddiemonge> only conflict i can see is that i added intro to both but as its the same exact file in the same exact location, im not sure if it will conflict or not

[15:41:58] <Wilto> Anyway, bailing out for the night—talk to you folks in the morning.
[15:50:36] <johnbender> eddiemonge: ah, I see, the intro text is added as part of the build target
[15:50:46] <johnbender> that's why its not listed in the js and css files
[15:50:48] <johnbender> makes sense
[15:51:04] <johnbender> thats also where the version is interpolated
[15:51:25] <kinblas> hey so is it ok to update to the HEAD?
[15:51:26] <eddiemonge> oh is that what you were asking about, the files array in the makefile?
[15:51:34] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah sorry

[15:51:40] <johnbender> kinblas: indeed
[15:51:46] <johnbender> eddiemonge: https://github.com/johnbender/jquery-mobile/commit/989f7f154261d12cd41352055bf775ae44b73480
[15:51:47] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by johnbender (6m, 40s ago): move intro to text for css combine, js combine, and makefile use
[15:51:58] <johnbender> I was thinking something like that for the intro file
[15:52:58] <eddiemonge> in root? i felt ... odd ... about having it there. thats why i had it in the js folder
[15:53:23] <johnbender> eddiemonge: yah, I'm nitpicking but it's also getting concatenated with css files so its odd to make it js file
[15:53:37] <johnbender> also it fits in with the version and license texts as far as purpose is concerened
[15:53:48] <eddiemonge> if its in root, i think it should have a more descriptive name like License.txt, if it even needs the extension at all
[15:53:49] <johnbender> this is such massive bikeshedding
[15:54:12] <eddiemonge> bikeshedding?
[15:54:17] <eddiemonge> ?define bikeshedding
[15:54:18] <bot-t> eddiemonge, bikeshedding - (noun) Futile investment of time and energy in marginal technical issues, often including annoying propaganda.
[15:54:42] <johnbender> eddiemonge: SOURCE_HEADER.txt ?
[15:54:50] <johnbender> eddiemonge: SOURCE_INFO.txt ?
[15:55:12] <eddiemonge> that makes it sound more like info about the source files
[15:55:32] <johnbender> PROJECT_INFO.txt?
[15:56:02] <eddiemonge> whats wrong with LICENSE_INFO.txt?
[15:56:27] <johnbender> works for me

[16:45:48] <eddiemonge> you got me confused.
[16:56:03] <eddiemonge> hmm uh oh
[16:57:10] <eddiemonge> small little problem. seems like for my mac, lines 114-116 need to be sed -i "" 'regex' but the linux server doesent like the "" part

[17:44:42] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (7.568s ago): Update Makefile to actually work on the server
[17:44:56] <eddiemonge> also, do you have access to the admin menu for github to change the hooks?
[17:47:45] <eddiemonge> one downside is that it now relies on perl
[17:47:54] <gseguin> johnbender: kinblas: any objection to moving collapsible set to its own plugin?
[17:48:13] <eddiemonge> which seems to be on most *nix boxes as opposed to trying to make sed -i work across more platforms
[17:48:32] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ^
[17:48:50] <kinblas> gseguin: why?
[17:49:26] <gseguin> first because when we do the builder people can use collapsible without collapsible set
[17:49:59] <gseguin> and also be some things where happening for every collapsible when the should happen only that collapsible set level
[17:50:04] <gseguin> and only once
[17:50:07] <kinblas> gseguin: can they initialize independent of each other?
[17:50:27] * kinblas notes he's about to land some collapsible changes
[17:50:30] <gseguin> collapsible-set obviously has a dependency on collapsible
[17:50:38] <gseguin> oh sh**
[17:50:43] <gseguin> really?
[17:50:51] <gseguin> what kind?
[17:51:08] <kinblas> gseguin: mainly getting rid of :eq pseudos in find() shaving 300msecs off WP7.5 load of the gallery page
[17:51:10] <gseguin> I was working on issue 2905
[17:51:19] <gseguin> oh ok
[17:51:25] <kinblas> I'm just waiting for unit test to finish
[17:51:27] <gseguin> I can port those
[17:51:28] <kinblas> then I was going to land
[17:52:41] <kinblas> gseguin: do your changes have to do with reducing the number of times collapsibleHeading manipulates the a:eq(0) and .ui-btn-inner?
[17:52:48] <kinblas> I noticed there were several of those in there
[17:53:19] <gseguin> nope
[17:53:26] <gseguin> I mainly moved code
[17:53:34] <gad-zllang> hello.
[17:53:36] <gseguin> decoupled as we say
[17:53:44] <kinblas> ok
[17:55:28] <gseguin> I can put that in a PR for your review

[22:17:21] <kinblas> gseguin: mIRC on windows, colloquy on Mac
[22:17:38] <gseguin> have you tried IRCCloud ?
[22:17:52] <kinblas> gseguin: is that the browser based one?
[22:17:57] <gseguin> indeed
[22:18:04] <kinblas> I tried it a couple of times
[22:18:08] <gseguin> it's awesome!
[22:18:13] <kinblas> scott had me sign up a while back
[22:18:29] <kinblas> does it have keyword hilighting now?
[22:18:35] <gseguin> yes
[22:18:55] <kinblas> gseguin: perhaps I'll give it another try
[22:18:57] <kinblas> :-)
[22:19:09] <gseguin> and the great thing is that you can always catch up on  a conversation
[22:19:28] <gseguin> you're never "offline"
[22:19:41] <kinblas> does it leave you logged in?
[22:19:48] <gseguin> yep
[22:19:49] <kinblas> or does it lurk
[22:20:06] <kinblas> ok I guess that's what todd uses
[22:20:13] <gseguin> leaves you logged in but you can set yourself away
[22:20:43] <gseguin> it'll actually set your status to away when you close the browser
[22:20:50] <gseguin> did you have time to review that PR?
[22:27:28] <kinblas> hmmm did someone mess with PHP combine scripts today?
[22:27:34] <kinblas> I updated and now I'm hosed
[22:27:40] <kinblas> I'm getting HTML in my JS
[22:27:54] <kinblas> gseguin: no I didn't yet
[22:27:55] <kinblas> sorry
[22:28:10] <gseguin> no problem
[22:28:18] <kinblas> are you in sync with the head?
[22:28:29] <kinblas> I'm getting garbage in my JS
[22:28:44] <gseguin> bender landed eddie's changes
[22:28:56] <gseguin> don't know if that's related
[22:29:12] <kinblas> grrr
[22:29:13] <kinblas> it is
[22:29:21] <kinblas> it's complaining about license stuff
[22:32:09] <johnbender> kinblas: what's up?
[22:32:28] <kinblas> johnbender: I updated and got eddies changes
[22:32:38] * johnbender cringes
[22:32:42] <johnbender> issues?
[22:33:05] <kinblas> now js/ is spewing error messages about not finding LICENSE-INFO.txt
[22:33:18] <kinblas> the curious thing is that it's at the top-level
[22:33:26] <kinblas> but the index.php is at the js/ level
[22:33:45] <johnbender> yep
[22:33:48] <johnbender> one sec
[22:34:24] <johnbender> kinblas: that should be a reference one level up
[22:34:43] <kinblas> right, so index.php should have ../LICENSE_INFO.txt?
[22:34:45] <johnbender> although I don't get any errors despite the misref
[22:34:51] <johnbender> kinblas: yah making the switch now
[22:34:54] <kinblas> this is stock PHP on Mac
[22:34:55] <johnbender> that's actually my fault
[22:35:32] <kinblas> I seem to remember some path problems with scripts referring to files with relative paths
[22:35:48] <kinblas> hence the combine at top and index.php setup today

[22:36:31] <johnbender> kinblas: ^
[22:37:22] <kinblas> ok back-in-the-saddle
[22:37:25] <kinblas> thanks
[22:39:06] <johnbender> kinblas: did you get a chance to try the dendrogram with the perf output?
[22:39:16] <johnbender> super curious to see if that will work
[22:39:36] <kinblas> johnbender: not yet
[22:40:06] <kinblas> johnbender: so is your goal for us to produce rubinius output? Or to just leverage that as a starting point for something that works with d3.js?
[22:40:31] <johnbender> kinblas: the second
[22:41:05] <johnbender> just hoping that we can port it to your perf output data structure
[22:42:03] <johnbender> I can start in on the porting tomorrow if you want to pass a link to your perf tool
[22:42:12] <johnbender> I didn't save the last one :(
[22:43:14] <johnbender> I was going to work on sorting out the user agent strings a bit tonight
[22:43:20] <johnbender> in the perf db
[22:44:38] <kinblas> johnbender: oh yeah I was going to mention that combining the average of all the devices is not helpful ... only because different things are slow on different devices
[22:45:03] <kinblas> so one thing that boosts a given platform, may not even show up on another, or it may wash it out
[22:45:40] <kinblas> this perf stuff is so ... dependent on what the browser, os, etc is doing at the time you are gathering the metrics so things swing wildly sometimes
[22:45:55] <kinblas> we really need averages on the devices themselves
[22:46:33] <johnbender> kinblas: thats what I was going to work on
[22:46:43] * johnbender sighs
[22:46:45] <johnbender> user agent strings
[22:46:53] <kinblas> that said, I know it's hard gathering data because all our devices are different, or have different os versions
[22:47:29] <kinblas> johnbender: oh yeah, I had  a chuckle at your email about pointing devices at that url and leaving them running
[22:47:42] <kinblas> I'm constantly touching my screens to keep them awake
[22:48:12] <kinblas> sometimes they go to sleep in the middle of a test ... quite annoying
[22:48:31] <johnbender> kinblas: I suppose I hadn't considered that
[22:48:35] <johnbender> hmm
[22:48:47] <johnbender> I wonder if we can write an app to do that for us
[22:48:55] <johnbender> native that is
[22:49:01] <kinblas> I just chuckled cause for me it's a chore to keep them awake if I'm not constantly interacting with it
[22:50:14] * kinblas tries out his jqm-data plugin to see if it gets rid of all the 1ms $.fn.jqmData calls

[22:50:35] <johnbender> wtf
[22:50:51] <johnbender> I mean I'm pretty sure an iOS device isn't going to have Android in it
[22:51:01] <johnbender> it's late
[22:51:07] <johnbender> now is the time for ranting
[22:51:21] <kinblas> lol
[22:51:29] * kinblas counts the engine and browser refernces

[23:00:40] <johnbender> brutal I forgot how limited sqlite's builtin functions are
[23:02:13] <johnbender> I might have to do this as part of the JS
[23:21:11] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[23:21:12] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #241: FIXED in 12 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/241/

[23:43:37] <johnbender> kinblas: do you know if the iphone ua is different from the ios simulator
[23:43:54] <johnbender> the simulator ua does have the word "simulator" in it :(
[23:45:37] <kinblas> johnbender: do you need a quick util for echoing the UA?
[23:46:00] <kinblas> or do you want me to hit some page with my simulator so you can capture it?
[23:46:12] <johnbender> kinblas: I have the simulator
[23:46:33] <johnbender> just trying to get some san defaults in place for parsing the UA
