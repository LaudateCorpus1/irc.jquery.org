[03:27:36] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ping!
[03:28:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey!
[03:28:17] <uGoMobi> hey _|Nix|_ !
[03:28:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: can you take a look at this issue https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5085
[03:28:42] <uGoMobi> it's about query params again
[03:29:22] <_|Nix|_> Man!
[03:29:29] <uGoMobi> that guy used our Dynamically Injecting Pages example
[03:29:44] <_|Nix|_> I don't believe we support deep linking with query params ...
[03:29:51] <uGoMobi> exactly
[03:30:07] <uGoMobi> but what I don't understand is that it did work in 1.1.1
[03:32:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Because 1.1.1 has a version of jQuery where that selector did not fail.
[03:32:32] <uGoMobi> ah that story
[03:38:47] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: thanks for commenting
[03:40:07] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: This query parameter thing might be something to consider for the nav refactor ... it seems a lot of people have been using it, since it accidentally worked.
[03:40:42] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: I agree, it is one of the most requested features

[08:25:39] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: you here?
[08:25:49] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes
[08:25:52] <toddmparker_> irccloud is being freaky this morning
[08:25:58] <toddmparker_> did i miss anything from you?
[08:25:59] <uGoMobi> IRCCLoud working again?
[08:26:07] <uGoMobi> yeah, I am on chatzilla  now
[08:26:20] <toddmparker_> last i see was me saying " i get all OCD that way sometimes too...just..one...more...fix..."
[08:26:29] <uGoMobi> no you didn't miss anything
[08:26:39] <toddmparker_> oh, ok
[08:26:54] <toddmparker_> we should look at roadmap and feature request stuff soon
[08:26:57] <toddmparker_> you have time?
[08:27:32] <uGoMobi> yes we should and I have time
[08:28:46] <uGoMobi> ok back on IRCCloud

[08:29:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs: fixed a typo in search/nav. - Jasper de Groot
[08:49:40] <toddmparker_> this thing on?
[08:49:46] <toddmparker_> wonky
[08:50:20] <toddmparker_> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USu6OD7JrDJMURG_tyCvAcI4-80l9sqeH0ZZ8dwT2es/edit
[08:50:21] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi:
[08:51:02] <uGoMobi> I am here
[08:52:15] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: I added most open feature requests at the bottom of that doc
[08:54:01] <toddmparker_> cool
[08:55:17] <toddmparker_> one thing I've been thinking about is whether we should hit some of the low hanging fruit items that people are asking for in 1.3 - basic responsive grids, listview grid, etc.
[08:56:40] <toddmparker_> looking at this feature request list you added, i think all of these are really good and probably fairly low effort
[08:56:44] <toddmparker_> except
[08:56:45] <toddmparker_> [?] Allow query params
[08:56:45] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2859
[08:56:56] <toddmparker_> ^^ that one is trickier
[08:57:11] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: yes
[08:57:22] <uGoMobi> maybe as part of nav refactor
[08:57:32] <toddmparker_> yeah
[08:57:38] <toddmparker_> this too: [?] Scroll to top of a collapsible (set) its contents on expand
[08:57:38] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2167
[08:57:53] <toddmparker_> not sure how to do that well, but it would be nice
[08:57:54] <uGoMobi> same as allow deeplinking to # anchors
[08:58:03] <toddmparker_> would require a lot fo finesse
[08:58:12] <toddmparker_> ha! was just going to ask about that item...is that here?
[08:58:15] <uGoMobi> yes, it has been tried before
[08:58:24] <toddmparker_> we have an issue somewhere for # links
[08:58:30] <toddmparker_> i'd personally like to get that working
[08:58:37] <toddmparker_> it's sorely missed
[08:58:50] <uGoMobi> I agree
[08:58:55] <uGoMobi> it is in the roadmap
[08:59:45] <uGoMobi> 1.4 Ability to use anchor links - make compatible with our AJAX nav
[09:00:43] <toddmparker_> gotcha
[09:01:02] <toddmparker_> for now, i moved a most of those up into 1.3 for now
[09:01:10] <toddmparker_> but separate so we cna adjust
[09:01:42] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: nav refactor and responsive/tablet layouts should be the priorities for 1.3 then
[09:01:45] <toddmparker_> i wonder if we should think about moving fetchlink out so we can hit on some of these smaller, but useful improvements
[09:01:52] <toddmparker_> that's my thought too
[09:02:07] <uGoMobi> yes fetchlink and carousel maybe 1.4
[09:02:50] <uGoMobi> we also have to do a lot of work on creating examples for in the new docs
[09:02:52] <toddmparker_> yeah
[09:02:55] <toddmparker_> think adding
[09:02:55] <toddmparker_> Slider: full width demo/option
[09:02:55] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5045
[09:03:19] <toddmparker_> some of these i'd like to handle as demo/tutorials if we dont' want to bloat the API
[09:03:37] <toddmparker_> or just a class you can add to the widget if we can pull it off with markup/css
[09:04:16] <toddmparker_> i'm thinking that can be a big task we cna work on in october - make a ton of demos that show off the power of what we have already
[09:04:25] <uGoMobi_> I think we should make it consistent with the other form elements which are full width as from 1.2
[09:04:39] <uGoMobi_> but hiding the input etc should go in a demo
[09:05:17] <uGoMobi_> using the docs primarily for examples is a great tool
[09:05:59] <toddmparker_> agreed
[09:06:18] <toddmparker_> the API docs agcolom is doing will take the pressure off
[09:06:23] <uGoMobi_> instead of adding all kind of options just show how you can do it with bit of custom code
[09:06:28] <toddmparker_> this is our kitchen sink / real world demos
[09:06:32] <toddmparker_> exactly
[09:06:39] <uGoMobi_> yeah I really like that
[09:06:46] <uGoMobi_> docs should become demos
[09:07:00] <uGoMobi_> just link to the api docs on the website
[09:07:01] <toddmparker_> i'd rather move towards simplifying our API if we can - dropping the style classes like shadow and corner in favor of using classes
[09:07:05] <toddmparker_> yep
[09:07:12] <toddmparker_> so thoughts on responsive
[09:07:12] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3855
[09:07:24] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4955
[09:07:58] <toddmparker_> I think the ability to just add a class to grids to make them stack at narrow widths is super easy to add
[09:07:59] <uGoMobi_> 3855 is not very specific
[09:08:11] <toddmparker_> but i'm wondering how much further we can/should go
[09:08:31] <toddmparker_> RWD is about designing your breakpoints to work with your content so it's hard to make these too generic
[09:08:40] <uGoMobi_> one thing we can do is look into what are good breakpoints to use
[09:09:04] <toddmparker_> we could, for example add a few more grid types that vary the widths a bit for common situations
[09:09:17] <uGoMobi_> yes
[09:09:30] <toddmparker_> 25/75, 75/25, 25/50/25, 33/66/33
[09:09:36] <toddmparker_> that kind of thing
[09:09:43] <uGoMobi_> something like 960grid for mobile
[09:09:52] <toddmparker_> yeah, but less complex
[09:09:53] <uGoMobi_> but more simple
[09:09:55] <uGoMobi_> haha
[09:09:57] <toddmparker_> +1
[09:10:14] <toddmparker_> i personally don't like these super granular grid systems
[09:10:26] <uGoMobi_> i never used them
[09:10:28] <toddmparker_> in RWD, you usually have a few simple columns that stack
[09:12:41] <toddmparker_> i'd like to start clarifying the roadmap, making issues for each item, etc.
[09:13:02] <uGoMobi_> I am always in favor of structure
[09:13:04] <uGoMobi_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4956
[09:13:17] <toddmparker_> seems like we might want to move forward the grid widgetizing
[09:13:20] <uGoMobi_> that one is about grid layout for listview
[09:13:27] <toddmparker_> and the ability to use widgets outside a page, esp. popups
[09:14:00] <toddmparker_> yep - already added to the roadmap
[09:14:06] <toddmparker_> see the list at the end of 1.3?
[09:14:15] <toddmparker_> figure we can collect, then organize
[09:14:27] <uGoMobi_> yes see it
[09:14:40] <toddmparker_> Make controlgroup function a widget
[09:14:40] <toddmparker_> Make grid function a widget
[09:14:56] <toddmparker_> ^^ these seem like we should do it sooner to get our widgets in line
[09:15:56] <uGoMobi_> grid function certainly
[09:16:25] <uGoMobi_> so we can use it for the new features
[09:16:45] <toddmparker_> yeah
[09:16:52] <toddmparker_> seems like pretty light work
[09:16:58] <toddmparker_> might be able to do that in oct too
[09:16:59] <uGoMobi_> controlgroup shouldn't be too difficult too
[09:17:11] <toddmparker_> widetify everything, add docs
[09:17:45] <toddmparker_> i just made a sweeping change to move fetchlink and carousel into 1.4
[09:17:55] <toddmparker_> moved up more housecleaning and responsive items
[09:19:07] <toddmparker_> Add active states per swatch instead of global, update ThemeRoller to accomodate
[09:19:18] <uGoMobi_> 1.3 focus on current plugins (nav refactor, popup, grid, controlgroup)
[09:19:27] <uGoMobi_> 1.4 performance
[09:20:17] <toddmparker_> yep
[09:20:22] <toddmparker_> i like that idea
[09:20:40] <uGoMobi_> active state per swatch is indeed mostly ThemeRoller work
[09:20:56] <uGoMobi_> changing theme CSS won't take much time
[09:20:56] <toddmparker_> should we move that forward?
[09:21:10] <toddmparker_> it would require updating all the plugins to set the themed active swatch
[09:21:20] <uGoMobi_> do you think Tyler has time to work on that?
[09:21:21] <toddmparker_> but that's most of it aside from adding to TR
[09:21:29] <toddmparker_> i need to follow up on that today
[09:21:39] <toddmparker_> we need to get TR in shape for 1.2 asap anyway
[09:21:52] <uGoMobi_> I don't think we need to update plugins
[09:22:19] <uGoMobi_> because the active state is added next to the theme swatch class
[09:22:29] <uGoMobi_> have to check though
[09:25:12] <toddmparker_> i see
[09:25:26] <uGoMobi_> maybe better to update plugins, otherwise you get a bunch of CSS selectors... .ui-btn-up-c.ui-btn-active, .ui-btn-hover-c.ui-btn-active, .ui-btn-down-c.ui-btn-active
[09:25:36] <toddmparker_> seems like a smaller change that would be worth looking at
[09:25:47] <toddmparker_> agree the css selectors might get out of hand
[09:26:01] <toddmparker_> we already know the swatch letter so tacking that on should be easy
[09:27:37] <toddmparker_> so 1.3 is looking more focused to me. lots of different changes but the theme of making the APi consistent and adding in some responsive basics seems good
[09:28:08] <toddmparker_> one question is whether we should still try to add in a new widget
[09:28:29] <toddmparker_> technically the tab/grouped collapsible is still there so that's new
[09:28:43] <toddmparker_> not sure how clean that will be to add via collapsible
[09:29:04] <toddmparker_> seems to be messy but that could just mean we need to step in
[09:29:39] <toddmparker_> one item that might be fairly light but useful to add sooner would be support for responsive data tables
[09:29:46] <toddmparker_> Responsive tables - see Filament Group’s table script
[09:29:58] <toddmparker_> http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_design_approach_for_complex_multicolumn_data_tables/
[09:30:12] <uGoMobi_> I was just looking at that one
[09:30:18] <toddmparker_> needs refinement but it's a pretty simple script
[09:30:49] <uGoMobi_> I agree that using collapsible to achieve that might not be the best approach
[09:32:56] <toddmparker_> it's tempting, just dunno how much we need to un-do collapsible styles to make tabs work
[09:33:17] <toddmparker_> with tabs, we have to deal with text fitting in the space
[09:33:21] <uGoMobi_> I have cloned Sven his repo for the tabview
[09:33:28] <toddmparker_> cool
[09:33:38] <uGoMobi_> and it is quite complex to make it work
[09:33:48] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[09:33:56] <uGoMobi_> and when you need more code to make it work with an existing widget
[09:34:00] <toddmparker_> ha
[09:34:05] <uGoMobi_> it might be better to look at something new
[09:34:09] <toddmparker_> yeah, that's a sign it's not a good idea
[09:34:29] <toddmparker_> but is that extra code because of how they approached it?
[09:35:01] <uGoMobi_> more code because we need to negate regular collapsible style
[09:35:29] <uGoMobi_> that gives me the impression that there might be ways to accomplish it with less code
[09:35:57] <toddmparker_> yeah, worth looking at
[09:36:13] <uGoMobi_> but have to spend more time on it before I can actually conclude that
[09:36:14] <toddmparker_> so i think we should keep "tab" in for 1.3, but decide HOW as we go
[09:36:34] <uGoMobi_> agreed
[09:37:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: did you see the security fix I put in yesterday?
[09:37:36] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender - i did, it's sort fo greek to me :)
[09:38:01] <uGoMobi_> greek doesn't sound really secure to me these days ;)
[09:38:14] <toddmparker_> currency BURN
[09:38:14] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so in fixing the authority encoding xss issue I re-introduced the hash encoding xss issue from FF :/
[09:38:35] <toddmparker_> ugh. firefox - who uses that anymore :0
[09:38:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: anyhow both are addressed
[09:39:35] <johnbender> the tests are green, so I'm not particularly concerned
[09:39:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: one thing that I think we should consider is that we can always blast out a 1.2.1 if we run into anything
[09:39:54] <Wilto> [ Kermit the frog joke here. ]
[09:39:58] <toddmparker_> true
[09:39:59] <johnbender> we don't have to be too ginger with releases
[09:40:09] <johnbender> though you don't want to do that every time
[09:40:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 4 new commits to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/4wEnUw
[09:40:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Docs: consistent styling for deprecated notes. - Jasper de Groot
[09:40:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Docs (transitions): grammar correction. - Jasper de Groot
[09:40:12] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Docs (config): Added maxTransitionWidth and transitionFallbacks - Jasper de Groot
[09:40:13] <johnbender> otherwise people will just wait
[09:40:29] <toddmparker_> we already had a few items we wanted to land for 1.2.1 dealing with ajax nav, right?
[09:40:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sorta
[09:40:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: there was the plugin fix but he was fine with waiting
[09:41:02] <johnbender> actually very polite
[09:41:13] <toddmparker_> see this johnbender - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5085
[09:41:37] <toddmparker_> convo with one of the guys who built one of the recommended router plugins so he's worth listening to
[09:41:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: same one
[09:41:58] <johnbender> yah
[09:42:01] <johnbender> there are two issues for that
[09:42:05] <johnbender> the initial page params
[09:42:19] <toddmparker_> would be bad if we broke routers so i'm thinking we should be in close contact with the 2-3 router authors going forward
[09:42:23] <johnbender> to support that we could just strip them from the selector but I don't want to do that for the 1.2 release
[09:42:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it's just fallout from our poor use of the hash as a selector :/
[09:42:57] <toddmparker_> 1.2.1 or 1.3?
[09:43:00] <toddmparker_> yeah
[09:44:50] <toddmparker_> johnbender: uGoMobi and I have been hacking around the roadmap doc
[09:44:52] <toddmparker_> https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USu6OD7JrDJMURG_tyCvAcI4-80l9sqeH0ZZ8dwT2es/edit#
[09:45:06] <toddmparker_> i want to really get this in good shape so we can announce it
[09:45:10] <toddmparker_> and start working :)
[09:45:52] <toddmparker_> new idea: focus 1.3 on cleaning up existing plugins, adding small feature requests and getting some easier responsive stuff in
[09:46:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: that'd be great but we're not going to get all the "cleanup" in one release
[09:46:26] <johnbender> it's a long hard task
[09:46:26] <toddmparker_> to that end, i moved fetchlink and carousel to 1.4 and moved up some of the higher impact requests
[09:46:36] <johnbender> and something better left for completion over time
[09:46:38] <johnbender> to avoid bugs
[09:46:43] <toddmparker_> sure
[09:46:54] <toddmparker_> take a scan now...still rough
[09:48:03] <johnbender> seems like a lot to me
[09:48:37] <johnbender> I still see a lot of value in doing much smaller faster releases
[09:48:58] <johnbender> I realize we have to balance that with people's versioning expectations
[09:49:09] <johnbender> jquery hasn't ever done a 1.12 release for example
[09:49:48] <johnbender> the big upshot for smaller faster releases is that we get community eyes on our work
[09:49:56] <johnbender> and we'll end up with shorter beta/rc cycles
[09:50:07] <johnbender> simply as a function of less code being written behind closed doors
[09:50:25] <johnbender> the only thing we need to do is draw our lines closer together
[09:50:34] <johnbender> nothing else really needs to change
[09:50:35] <johnbender> well
[09:50:41] <johnbender> there will be more blog posts :)
[09:51:25] <toddmparker_> cleaning up now
[09:51:32] <toddmparker_> maybe we can skinny it down
[09:51:49] <toddmparker_> this one seems like a later thing
[09:51:51] <toddmparker_> Popup doesn't take into account positionTo on resize
[09:51:51] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4905
[09:52:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: maybe we could look at it from a resource allocation perspective
[09:52:54] <johnbender> toddmparker_: give everyone one solid thing to work on
[09:53:10] <johnbender> that should take a week or two to finish coding on
[09:53:16] <johnbender> maybe more
[09:53:21] <johnbender> and call it good
[09:57:27] <toddmparker_> yeah, good idea
[09:57:39] <toddmparker_> i'm working on the list now to clarify
[09:57:41] <uGoMobi> I agree we should prevent that we want to do too much and that people have to wait too long for next point release
[09:57:47] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: if you can help me find issues for these...
[09:57:55] <toddmparker_> exactly
[09:58:13] <toddmparker_> we're tracking to quarterly dot releases which seems reasonable
[09:58:43] <uGoMobi> 4 releases a year sounds good to me, what do you think johnbender ?
[09:58:43] <toddmparker_> since the alpha/beta/rc process can take a solid month, we need to build that in
[09:59:04] <johnbender> uGoMobi: yah that's a good goal
[09:59:11] <toddmparker_> even if we did a 2 week cycle for a release, we have a lot of overhead on the release cycle
[09:59:13] <johnbender> I'd actually like to see it much more frequently
[09:59:21] <johnbender> but that requires some complex branch management for large features
[09:59:22] <toddmparker_> i would too
[09:59:33] <johnbender> toddmparker_: right
[09:59:42] <johnbender> I think 2 months is probably about right
[09:59:46] <toddmparker_> but i wonder how we can speed up alpha > final
[09:59:47] <johnbender> and I think that's doable
[09:59:51] <toddmparker_> yeah
[09:59:52] <johnbender> a month for work
[09:59:57] <johnbender> and a month for the release
[10:00:03] <johnbender> a month is a long time to get shit done
[10:00:07] <johnbender> and if you make that the window
[10:00:11] <johnbender> people tend to focus
[10:00:14] <toddmparker_> my hope with 1.3 is we jam in october and get this out by the end of the year, ideally sooner
[10:00:20] <toddmparker_> yeah
[10:00:31] <johnbender> also
[10:00:32] <toddmparker_> that is why for 1.3, i want a crisp list with issues for each
[10:00:42] <johnbender> having a window makes it easier to think about what can actually go into the release
[10:01:08] <uGoMobi> I agree johnbender
[10:01:16] <johnbender> as we shrink that window too the release cycle will get shorter
[10:01:29] <johnbender> we spent a long time getting there
[10:01:38] <johnbender> which meant more complexity and more room for issues during
[10:01:56] <johnbender> smaller chunks of work for a release will naturally lead to a shorter release cycle
[10:03:28] <uGoMobi> so does focusing on just a few features
[10:11:03] <toddmparker_> look now: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1USu6OD7JrDJMURG_tyCvAcI4-80l9sqeH0ZZ8dwT2es/edit#
[10:11:19] <toddmparker_> it feels longer because i removed the lists and added subheads
[10:22:53] <toddmparker_> johnbender: how hard would this be:
[10:22:53] <toddmparker_> Allow all widgets to work outside a page container
[10:23:01] <toddmparker_> that could be moved to 1.4
[10:23:08] <toddmparker_> but it's a big request
[10:23:33] <toddmparker_> esp. for popups but they can contain any widget
[10:23:55] <uGoMobi> that reminds me that we have to think about what we do with nested listviews
[10:24:00] <toddmparker_> johnbender: also need you to either make or collect issues that will cover:
[10:24:01] <toddmparker_> Nav re-factor, work on exposing hooks for tracking in history (Bender)
[10:24:01] <toddmparker_> Issue needed
[10:24:27] <toddmparker_> maybe that is a good candidate for part of johnbender's nav re-factor?
[10:25:26] <uGoMobi> I just added a few issues, will search for or create others tomorrow
[10:26:20] <toddmparker_> ok, cool
[10:26:35] <toddmparker_> this list seems very doable for about a month or so of dev
[10:26:59] <toddmparker_> but we can review in detail thursday
[10:27:09] <toddmparker_> i'd like to do a similair activity for 1.4
[10:27:29] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: part of doing this is I want to get a dev contract for you and filament written up
[10:27:42] <toddmparker_> a big part fo that is pointing to what we'll do in the next 6 months
[10:27:45] <uGoMobi> cool
[10:27:48] <uGoMobi> thanks
[10:28:01] <uGoMobi> I understand
[10:28:05] <toddmparker_> which means 1.3-1.5 should be pretty crisp
[10:29:22] <uGoMobi> do you want to add new docs with examples to the roadmap too?
[10:30:41] <uGoMobi> although that's more an on going thing
[10:31:17] <uGoMobi> gseguin: are you around?
[10:31:27] <gseguin> I am
[10:31:31] <gseguin> 'sup uGoMobi
[10:31:33] <uGoMobi> hi!
[10:31:37] <gseguin> hey
[10:31:56] <uGoMobi> gseguin: I wanted to add getMaxScrollForTransition  to configurable defaults doc page
[10:32:21] <gseguin> ok
[10:32:25] <uGoMobi> any restrictions or can people just set what ever value they like?
[10:32:49] <uGoMobi> have to admit I didn't check the function
[10:32:53] <gseguin> oh they can shoot themselves in the foot if they want
[10:33:16] <gseguin> let me double check
[10:33:22] <uGoMobi> is that a bool or a string? ;)
[10:33:35] <gseguin> but right now I think it's set for 3 page height scroll
[10:33:46] <uGoMobi> yes by default
[10:34:06] <uGoMobi> but you can configure it, right?
[10:34:19] <gseguin> yeah by overriding it
[10:34:43] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'll probably do the refactor and features/issues separate
[10:34:52] <gseguin> it needs to return an integer
[10:34:55] <toddmparker_> that's fine johnbender
[10:35:06] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the goal with the refactor is just to support the exact same functionality that we have now and make it easier to do things like fixes and features
[10:35:11] <johnbender> for at least a subset of the functionality
[10:35:17] <johnbender> we'll see how much I get done
[10:35:18] <toddmparker_> maybe you can make an issue outlining what re-factor items you want to hit?
[10:35:26] <johnbender> but I don't imagine I'll get to changePage and loadPage
[10:35:32] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah that's a good idea
[10:35:36] <toddmparker_> one biggie for me is how to support anchor links
[10:35:48] <toddmparker_> it really should be baked into the nav model
[10:36:03] <toddmparker_> so if i have <a href="#foo"
[10:36:26] <gseguin> uGoMobi: did I answer your question?
[10:36:33] <toddmparker_> the nav model looks to see if it's a page with that ID and if not, it does some magic to scrollt o
[10:36:49] <toddmparker_> same for bar.html#foo
[10:37:03] <uGoMobi> gseguin: does that mean you can't disable it?
[10:37:05] <toddmparker_> not trivial,but it's the one web convention we break
[10:37:38] <uGoMobi> gseguin: you would have to set it to 9999 or something
[10:37:42] <gseguin> disable it in what way?
[10:37:45] <gseguin> oh that way
[10:37:54] <gseguin> yeah or return Infinity
[10:38:00] <uGoMobi> ok
[10:38:07] <uGoMobi> well I just don't mention that
[10:38:33] <uGoMobi> any integer goes
[10:39:10] <uGoMobi> gseguin: thanks!
[10:39:12] <toddmparker_> johnbender: one more big item
[10:39:22] <gseguin> uGoMobi: you're welcome
[10:39:25] <toddmparker_> (not for 1.3, just wanted you opinion on LOE)
[10:39:26] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4935
[10:39:47] <toddmparker_> basically, make it possible to just attach widget events but not the markup decoration
[10:39:54] <toddmparker_> would be huge for backbone type apps
[10:42:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I'm not  clear on what the goal is
[10:42:24] <johnbender> everything but enhance?
[10:42:42] <johnbender> that doesn't always make sense does it, given we do a lot of binding to the extra markup we add?
[10:43:00] <agcolom> hi! any views on having a progress bar widget that could be like the slider, just without the handle and the input field?
[10:43:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: or are you talking about prerendering
[10:43:54] <johnbender> ah
[10:43:55] <johnbender> ok
[10:43:58] <johnbender> read the issue text :/
[10:44:03] <johnbender> just that featrue in general
[10:44:08] <johnbender> bindings without enhancement
[10:44:14] <Wilto> I know a Backbone bro that has worked with jQM pretty heavily, if we wanna get some perspective from there.
[10:44:16] <johnbender> that's a lot of work
[10:44:48] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it would be cool to see community support for like handelbars or mustache templates for the enhanced marku
[10:44:51] <johnbender> *markup
[10:44:59] <johnbender> I mean
[10:45:07] <johnbender> we could also be using the templates ._.
[10:45:36] <johnbender> but then we'd have to do some serious choosing or introduce our own templating solution
[10:45:42] <johnbender> nightmares
[10:46:37] <toddmparker_> johnbender: yep. if i use client-side templating or just want to make life easier on my mobile device, I should be able to serve up pre-enhanced markup
[10:47:16] <toddmparker_> yeah, taking sides on templating would be...interesting
[10:47:37] <johnbender> brutal
[10:47:39] <johnbender> anyhow
[10:47:40] <toddmparker_> ultimately, i'd like to re-vamp our markup so it doesn't need decoration/enhancement
[10:47:42] <johnbender> I see the value
[10:47:45] <johnbender> that's a lot of work though
[10:47:48] <toddmparker_> just by embracing newer techniques
[10:47:56] <johnbender> it would be nice to split of the morass of the _create methods a bit
[10:48:02] <toddmparker_> so maybe that gets moved out to 1.5 :)
[10:48:06] <johnbender> something like that
[10:48:19] <johnbender> toddmparker_: luckily that's easy to test
[10:48:22] <johnbender> well
[10:48:25] <johnbender> easyish
[10:48:27] <toddmparker_> i'll leave it at 1.4 for now, still working thru things
[10:50:36] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: should i keep this for 1.3? There is a PR - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4809
[10:51:22] <toddmparker_> johnbender: part of nav re-factor for 1.3? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4022
[10:51:38] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: only if you want to use the roadmap as guide to write the release notes later
[10:51:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: nope but that's something to do for sure
[10:51:56] <uGoMobi> I am sure we won't forget to pull after 1.2 final release
[10:52:02] <johnbender> transitions and nav are separate concerns
[10:52:03] <toddmparker_> i'm reconciling the roadmap with issues tagged to 1.3
[10:52:23] <toddmparker_> i also am using the roadmap to say "here are the features to expect"
[10:52:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: you can leave it in 1.3 since it shouldn't be much trouble
[10:52:35] <johnbender> but I would make it really tentative
[10:52:37] <johnbender> actually
[10:52:40] <johnbender> push it out :(
[10:53:14] <toddmparker_> this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4022
[10:53:17] <toddmparker_> ok
[10:53:41] <toddmparker_> i'm 100% fine with moving stuff out
[10:53:55] <toddmparker_> i just want a nice list of good stuff to work on that is manageable
[10:56:16] <agcolom> toddmparker_ & all: any views on having a progress bar widget that could be like the slider, just without the handle and the input field?
[10:56:18] <toddmparker_> johnbender: for 1.3? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3978
[10:56:59] <toddmparker_> agcolom: that is certainly an easy widget to add, not too sure of how useful it is in the real world
[10:57:16] <toddmparker_> should be in the roadmap somewhere
[10:57:28] <toddmparker_> just so easy to add = two divs
[10:57:42] <johnbender> toddmparker_: arg yah we should address that
[10:57:44] <toddmparker_> tho i wonder if some of these things could just be a demo
[10:57:44] <agcolom> toddmparker_: yes I thought it'd be easy, could be usefule for form fillling that takes more than 1 page maybe...
[10:57:47] <johnbender> hopefully I can get to it :/
[10:57:50] <toddmparker_> true
[10:57:52] <agcolom> useful ^
[10:57:57] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we've got most of it done
[10:57:58] <johnbender> err
[10:58:00] <johnbender> a stopgap
[10:58:03] <johnbender> in disabling it
[10:58:07] <johnbender> it's in a branch to merge
[10:58:12] <toddmparker_> assuming this would be part of the nav re-work?
[10:58:33] <toddmparker_> i won't list it in the roadmap, but will leave it tagged to 1.3
[10:58:36] <toddmparker_> sound ok?
[10:59:39] <agcolom> toddmparker_: should we add a pull to refresh widget on the roadmap?
[11:00:15] <agcolom> ^ sorry add to
[11:01:21] <toddmparker_> i think that is already a demo under fetchlink (which i've moved out to 1.4)
[11:01:42] <agcolom> toddmparker_: ok, good, thanks
[11:02:27] <johnbender> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5091
[11:02:29] <johnbender> rough ideas
[11:02:39] <johnbender> toddmparker_: leaving in a half hour for my preso
[11:02:41] <johnbender> need to get ready
[11:02:46] <johnbender> haven't eaten
[11:02:55] <toddmparker_> eat!
[11:02:58] <toddmparker_> and good luck!!
[11:03:14] <johnbender> toddmparker_: thanks, with any luck they won't think I'm a total doof
[11:03:16] <johnbender> :)
[11:03:36] <toddmparker_> you are a really great presenter
[11:03:41] <toddmparker_> seriously
[11:03:44] <agcolom> good luck johnbender!
[11:03:46] <toddmparker_> but you are a doof
[11:04:00] <johnbender> toddmparker_: hahah thanks :)
[11:04:12] <johnbender> agcolom: thanks
[11:04:13] <johnbender> :)
[11:04:16] * johnbender is excited
[11:04:54] <Wilto> Give ’em hell, johnbender.
[11:05:57] <uGoMobi> go bender go bender
[11:06:39] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/goteamventure.gif
[11:09:36] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: one thing we could do is have people help us build more transitions
[11:10:11] <toddmparker_> some people like the 1.0 style transitions and they can all be re-built using the sync/asnc hander, we just didn't make 'em
[11:10:15] <toddmparker_> see fade vs. slidefade
[11:10:26] <toddmparker_> maybe another activity for actober
[11:10:37] <uGoMobi> yeah
[11:10:44] <uGoMobi> and post on the forum maybe
[11:15:21] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: do you want IE transitions in the roadmap https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4875
[11:15:27] <uGoMobi> I have the CSS ready
[11:16:20] <uGoMobi> just have to look into the support functions
[11:17:42] <toddmparker_> yep, it's there for 1.3
[11:17:52] <toddmparker_> Add non-prefixed keyframe properties to make transitions work in IE10
[11:17:52] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4875
[11:18:03] <toddmparker_> re-wrote the title in the map
[11:18:06] <toddmparker_> under nav
[11:18:16] <toddmparker_> we need to do that
[11:18:37] <uGoMobi> ah sorry, didn't see it first
[11:21:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: if we do that post transition handler refactor we could provide it as an object api
[11:47:41] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: question for you
[11:47:56] <toddmparker_> for "Make controlgroup function a widget"
[11:48:14] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:48:14] <toddmparker_> should i link to a few issues that would be resolved by this in the roadmap
[11:48:24] <toddmparker_> or create a new issue with that name and reference issues
[11:48:36] <toddmparker_> thinking the latter is cleaner
[11:49:12] <uGoMobi> I agree, but we have to be sure that those will be fixed
[11:49:30] <uGoMobi> maybe just comment that those are closed as duplicate but have to be tested
[11:49:32] <toddmparker_> sure
[11:49:48] <toddmparker_> so make new issues and in that reference these others?
[11:49:57] <uGoMobi> yes
[11:51:05] <uGoMobi> I will do the same
[11:52:20] <toddmparker_> ok
[11:52:26] <uGoMobi> and check for duplicate feature requests... give one a milestone and remove milestone and FR flag from others
[11:52:30] <toddmparker_> looking thru the feature request wiki
[11:52:37] <toddmparker_> right
[11:52:39] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2230
[11:53:02] <toddmparker_> this would be useful as a new list type
[11:53:03] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/ocoyon/27
[11:54:35] <toddmparker_> not sure it needs to be so complex, code-wise
[11:54:49] <toddmparker_> rather just use a markup pattern with some css
[11:55:35] <uGoMobi> is it semantically wrong to have a DL with DT/DD nested inside an LI
[11:55:48] <uGoMobi> cos that's the first thing I thought about
[11:56:05] <uGoMobi> and just add some CSS to style the DL
[11:57:09] <uGoMobi> or is that a bad idea?
[11:57:51] <uGoMobi> the problem with add ing those kind of things to the framework is that everybody wants it just a little bit different
[11:58:33] <uGoMobi> if we find a simpler solution we can just add an code example to the docs
[12:00:58] <toddmparker_> i agree
[12:01:20] <toddmparker_> this is a simple enough pattern that I think we could could add a demo or styles
[12:01:43] <uGoMobi> yes, it looks like a lot of code
[12:01:58] <toddmparker_> wilto says having a dl inside a ul/ol is legit
[12:02:10] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:02:11] <toddmparker_> so we could just handle that pattern
[12:02:21] <toddmparker_> i think he way over-complicated it
[12:02:29] <uGoMobi> that seems like proper markup for this
[12:02:45] <toddmparker_> just looking for small, but useful additions
[12:04:07] <toddmparker_> just wonder if we need all the JS or if we can style the dt to be text left and the dd aligned right
[12:05:08] <toddmparker_> or maybe we just add a single container which aligns the contents right and that's it
[12:05:23] <toddmparker_> less semantic, but he has to toss out the DLs in JS
[12:08:29] <toddmparker_> looking thru feature requests, we've done pretty good. added a bunch of items already
[12:08:46] <toddmparker_> we should edit to note when they have landed.
[12:09:20] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: for responsive layouts, i saw you chimed in here
[12:09:21] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3855#issuecomment-8899117
[12:09:34] <toddmparker_> i think this is more about complex layout like a multi-pane
[12:10:03] <toddmparker_> i think for 1.3, we may just add rules to stack, like this
[12:10:04] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4955
[12:10:10] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: ohw :(
[12:10:35] <uGoMobi> I thought it was just about a grid and media queries
[12:11:05] <toddmparker_> all depends on how you read it
[12:11:23] <uGoMobi> I will write a comment
[12:11:31] <toddmparker_> that guy was working on the crazy multi-pane thing so I know where his mind is
[12:11:47] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[12:11:47] <toddmparker_> is this just a bunch of floated containers? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3952
[12:11:53] <uGoMobi> sorry
[12:11:57] <toddmparker_> np
[12:12:06] <uGoMobi> http://jsbin.com/uwaxaj/22/edit
[12:12:14] <uGoMobi> that's a DL in a LI
[12:13:21] <uGoMobi> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3952 is not something for the framework if you ask me
[12:14:06] <uGoMobi> you have to make it a widget with an option to set the colomn width
[12:14:44] <uGoMobi> while you can just overwrite the grid/block CSS (fixed width instead of %)
[12:15:11] <uGoMobi> or you add your own classes
[12:15:20] <toddmparker_> that is is issue with all responsive stuff
[12:15:32] <toddmparker_> you need to tune breakpoints and such
[12:15:47] <toddmparker_> i dunno if these are just demo opportunities
[12:15:57] <toddmparker_> i don't want to use JS for this stuff
[12:16:10] <uGoMobi> agreed
[12:16:17] <toddmparker_> we could always have some pre-baked styles and show how to override
[12:19:01] <toddmparker_> think we need to add a lot of RWD technique demos
[12:19:19] <toddmparker_> i've seen so many "RWD or jQM?" tweets
[12:19:24] <toddmparker_> both
[12:20:50] <uGoMobi> indeed
[12:20:57] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: i wonder how much work "Allow all widgets to work outside a page container" will really be
[12:21:07] <toddmparker_> might want to push that to 1.4
[12:21:22] <uGoMobi> it would be a nice showcase and also reduce number os issues (read: issue with custom code)
[12:21:55] <uGoMobi> I think it's mostly about listviews
[12:22:07] <uGoMobi> page sections shouldn't be a big problem
[12:26:01] <toddmparker_> cool
[12:26:06] <toddmparker_> i'll leave as is in 1.3
[12:26:19] <toddmparker_> so for vanilla lists, they seem to work al already
[12:26:20] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/uqoxim/1/edit
[12:26:28] <toddmparker_> twitter client sceanario
[12:26:48] <toddmparker_> we had an issue for this, but seems fine if you want to make a listview with embedded links
[12:27:31] <uGoMobi> interesting, didn't know that
[12:28:54] <toddmparker_> i was thinking about the old way we did listviews where we found the first link and made the whole row link to that
[12:29:02] <toddmparker_> now, you wrap the contents in a link
[12:29:10] <toddmparker_> so we're set on vanilla
[12:29:21] <toddmparker_> if you wanted to make a split button, that is uglier
[12:29:43] <toddmparker_> might be nice to make if possible to flag a link as the split button
[12:29:53] <toddmparker_> so it's not inferred
[12:30:39] <uGoMobi> data-style option or something
[12:32:48] <uGoMobi> or just class="ui-split" on the UL
[12:33:36] <uGoMobi> and then style the last anchor element in the LI as split button
[12:34:01] <uGoMobi> instead of counting number of anchors and make it a split button if more than 1
[12:34:31] <uGoMobi> I have to go to the store for a moment... be back later
[12:47:02] <toddmparker_> ok
[12:47:07] <toddmparker_> but - i like that idea
[13:06:53] <Wilto> So, 3d transform tests are failing in Chrome 22+.
[13:07:06] <uGoMobi> Wilto: not here
[13:07:13] <Wilto> —what
[13:07:17] <uGoMobi> I am on Window now
[13:07:24] <Wilto> OS X here.
[13:07:24] <uGoMobi> just updated to 22
[13:08:21] <Wilto> Fine on Todd’s, too…
[13:08:24] <Wilto> Maybe a Retina thing?
[13:12:25] <agcolom> let me try...
[13:13:03] <agcolom> Wilto: you have the retina macbook?
[13:13:08] <Wilto> Sure do.
[13:13:12] <Wilto> For better or worse.
[13:13:34] <agcolom> OMG!!!! Is it nice??
[13:14:05] <Wilto> It sure is pretty, but… let’s just say that my “I need this for testing” excuse was actually justified this time.
[13:14:11] <uGoMobi> I guess that was a rhetorical question
[13:14:30] <agcolom> uGoMobi: 3D transitions seem fine here (Mac OS X)
[13:14:34] <agcolom> not retina...
[13:14:38] <Wilto> I am at once glad that I have it, and hate that it exists.
[13:14:44] <Wilto> Let me restart; maybe something is busted here.
[13:14:53] <agcolom> tried with that page: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html
[13:17:23] <uGoMobi> Retina is just about the pixel density, right?
[13:17:36] <agcolom> that's what I thought....
[13:17:46] <agcolom> uGoMobi: how was shopping??
[13:18:01] <uGoMobi> shopping?
[13:18:06] <agcolom> (sorry I love shopping! even food shopping!)
[13:18:13] <uGoMobi> haha
[13:18:21] <agcolom> uGoMobi: you said you were going to the store...
[13:18:25] <uGoMobi> yeah
[13:18:28] <uGoMobi> food indeed
[13:18:36] <uGoMobi> and most important.... coffee
[13:18:42] <agcolom> oh! Nice!!!!
[13:19:12] <uGoMobi> anyway... it was nice :)
[13:19:48] <uGoMobi> now enjoying some kind of fruite juice I never had before
[13:20:28] <agcolom> you see, that's exactly what I love about food shopping! Trying new things that taste nice!
[13:21:29] <uGoMobi> yeah I have to admit I don't mind food shopping either
[13:22:33] <uGoMobi> ever heard of a fruit named guanabana?
[13:22:49] <agcolom> no, never!
[13:23:00] <uGoMobi> well neither did I
[13:23:35] <agcolom> just checked online ;-) Never seen it either!
[13:24:12] <uGoMobi> guanabana mango juice... mmm :D
[13:24:46] <agcolom> sounds very nice! Probably good energy for writing even better code ;-)
[13:25:01] <uGoMobi> haha
[13:25:09] <agcolom> Wilto: any news on the 3D transitions?
[13:27:18] <uGoMobi> Wilto: you set a bad example... test page missing, what platform/browser did you test on, etc., etc. ;-)
[13:27:27] <Wilto> But assigned to me!
[13:27:32] <Wilto> I am my own worst bug reporter.
[13:27:42] <Wilto> I’m confirming with other Retina-clad folks.
[13:27:48] <uGoMobi> ok
[13:28:09] <agcolom> that's very strange though...
[13:28:37] <agcolom> it is because there are too many pixels to worry about so Chrome decides not to deal with it??
[13:29:48] <agcolom> Wilto: have you tried asking Addy?
[13:31:52] <Wilto> DAMMIT, ADDY
[13:32:32] <agcolom> I can ask him on twitter if you like...
[13:33:37] <Wilto> Nah; I can bug ’em.
[13:33:51] <agcolom> ok :-)
[13:34:58] <uGoMobi> is the haz.io 3D test same as Modernizr?
[13:36:20] <agcolom> toddmparker_: are you still around?
[13:37:08] <agcolom> (I need your view for something on the api docs)
[13:41:27] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: figured out my issue w/ nfs... apparently OSX doesn't let you export a symlink to a directory as an nfs share
[13:41:36] <Wilto> Okay, it’s not the test. 3d transforms are wholesale broken in Chrome 22+ on Retina. Where the bugtracker at.
[13:41:50] <Wilto> http://www.webkit.org/blog/386/3d-transforms/ doesn’t work at all, but works fine in Safari.
[13:42:57] <agcolom> Well that's definitely a good find!
[13:43:15] <agcolom> and another weird find for Wilto !
[13:43:25] <Wilto> I’m all about the weird bugs.
[13:44:14] <toddmparker_> sure am agcolom
[13:44:15] <agcolom> so how about mobile Chrome on iPad 3?
[13:44:59] <toddmparker_> that should be ok because it's still safari for rendering on iPad
[13:45:00] <agcolom> Hi toddmparker_, here's my question: in the api docs, at the moment there is no code example for methods and evetns
[13:45:28] <agcolom> toddmparker_: safari by default yes but I was thinking the Chrome app....
[13:45:38] <agcolom> (browser)
[13:45:49] <toddmparker_> the chrome app is still using safari
[13:46:00] <agcolom> to come back to the api docs... in our current docs, we do have code examples for that....
[13:46:08] <toddmparker_> you're not allowed to have your own rendering engine on iOS
[13:46:23] <toddmparker_> like this: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/search/events.html
[13:46:28] <agcolom> Should these be added? (feels a shame not to have it)
[13:46:31] <toddmparker_> just code blocks?
[13:46:34] <agcolom> yes
[13:46:36] <toddmparker_> yes please
[13:46:40] <agcolom> ok, cool....
[13:46:47] <agcolom> will add them.
[13:46:47] <toddmparker_> if you don't mind
[13:47:20] <agcolom> not at all... I'll have to revisit the existing 10 or 11 widgets we now have there, but I think it's worth it...
[13:48:19] <agcolom> Popup is nearly done.... just needs methods and events...
[13:48:39] <agcolom> I'm only testing in Safari....
[13:49:17] <agcolom> There's a but with Firefox which we can sort out next month...
[13:49:36] <agcolom> but I want to concentrate on the content for now...
[13:50:18] <agcolom> I'll be away at the school meeting tomorrow evening... so I'll send you an email with the updates for the week
[13:50:41] <agcolom> Hopefully this will be my last missed meeting!
[13:51:36] <agcolom> toddmparker_: this one: http://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/chrome/id535886823?mt=8
[13:51:55] <Wilto> …Something is amiss here.
[13:52:07] <toddmparker_> yeah, that is mobile webkit under the covers
[13:52:23] <toddmparker_> any "browser" on iOS is a glorified toolbar
[13:53:04] <agcolom> oh!
[13:53:44] <toddmparker_> funny, huh
[13:54:21] <agcolom> yes, I didn't know!
[13:55:44] <agcolom> toddmparker_: and I have to catch up with the resources page!!!!
[13:57:35] <agcolom> I don't like the up and down arrows on Chrome inside the input filed for sliders (http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/slider/)
[13:57:43] <agcolom> input field ^
[13:58:05] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: is multiple panes (thinking about your email app example) a feature we want to add, but not sure when or not sure if we want to add it at all?
[14:01:04] <agcolom> toddmparker_: Wilto : did I get this right: Adobe shadow is not called Adobe Edge Inspect? (I'd ask johnbender but I guess he is presenting !!!! )
[14:01:13] <agcolom> now ^ not not!!!!
[14:01:15] <Wilto> Yep, as of like a day or two ago.
[14:02:18] <agcolom> right! So should I download a new app ?
[14:02:45] <agcolom> (I was just finally coming round to trying shadow!)
[14:03:08] <agcolom> Thanks to a great video by @rem!
[14:04:13] <agcolom> Wilto: have you tried Adobe Edge Inspect?
[14:05:17] <Wilto> I haven’t, no.
[14:05:32] <Wilto> I’m loving the hell out of this iOS6 remote inspector, though.
[14:05:43] <agcolom> wait! what?
[14:06:57] <agcolom> Seriously things move so fast! I can never teach the same things two years in a row!
[14:13:21] <agcolom> ok... I'm installing Adobe Edge Inspect!
[14:13:37] <toddmparker_> i haven't fired it up yet
[14:13:54] <toddmparker_> uGoMobi: I dunno, think we need to address the multi-pane with history at some point
[14:14:04] <toddmparker_> i've been moving a lot of stuff around
[14:14:08] <toddmparker_> refresh
[14:14:16] <uGoMobi> ok
[14:14:19] <Wilto> http://jsfiddle.net/KvN4S/1/
[14:16:27] <toddmparker_> i've been thinking that a responsive table solution along with simple grids might be the marquee things for 1.3
[14:16:46] <toddmparker_> we've been saying we're going to have solutions for responsive for a year
[14:17:14] <agcolom> toddmparker_: sounds nice! I like the idea!
[14:17:16] <toddmparker_> in 1.4, we could offer a overflow utility and the carousel and/or tab widget
[14:17:40] <agcolom> sounds good too.
[14:17:55] <toddmparker_> then in 1.5 and 1.6 we can tackel bigger, harder things like handling nav with multi-panel, re-factoring the markup aggressively
[14:17:58] <agcolom> I like the fact that each release has its own theme and identity
[14:18:14] <toddmparker_> 1.4 - scrolly, swipy bits
[14:20:23] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: looks good
[14:26:57] <uGoMobi> getMaxScrollForTransition: Set a scroll position breakpoint for transitions. If the scroll position is more than the window height multiplied by the value that has been set, transition "none" will be used.
[14:27:22] <uGoMobi> can anyone give that a look?
[14:27:31] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ^^
[14:27:58] <uGoMobi> really don't know how to describe that properly
[14:28:19] <agcolom> uGoMobi: this seems clear to me (as is)
[14:28:45] <agcolom> maybe use "greater than"
[14:29:01] <uGoMobi> agcolom: ok, thanks
[14:29:09] <uGoMobi> will change that and commit
[14:29:28] <agcolom> Otherwise, it is very clear.
[14:29:53] <agcolom> (not ambiguous in any way so I like it ;-) )
[14:30:28] <toddmparker_> might be worth mentioning why we added this to the docs
[14:30:40] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/v1U2yw
[14:30:40] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs (config): added getMaxScrollForTransition. - Jasper de Groot
[14:30:40] <agcolom> well, it's been lovely to catch up with you all :-) Sorry I've been so busy!
[14:31:12] <toddmparker_> on long pages, iOS was trying to animate the whole page from the top to your scroll position which could make it take 30 seconds to change pages or even crash
[14:31:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] uGoMobi pushed 1 new commit to 1.1-stable: http://git.io/ZsEPuw
[14:31:35] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] Docs (config): added getMaxScrollForTransition. - Jasper de Groot
[14:31:41] <toddmparker_> no problem agcolom
[14:32:09] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[14:32:28] <uGoMobi> toddmparker_: that info is on the page transitions page, this is just for the configurable options page
[14:38:41] <agcolom> ok, bedtime in the UK :-) goodnight everyone :-)
[14:39:07] <uGoMobi> goodnight Anne
[14:39:17] <toddmparker_> goodnight
[14:45:50] <agcolom> toddmparker_: one last thing: the graph of the api docs code: https://github.com/jquery/api.jquerymobile.com/graphs/code-frequency... looks like we've reached 9k lines!
[14:46:32] <toddmparker_> eesh...is that a good thing?
[14:46:38] <agcolom> this time I am going to bed!
[14:46:47] <agcolom> toddmparker_: yes ;-)
[14:47:21] <agcolom> the more lines there are, the more JQM is covered!
[14:47:31] <toddmparker_> ah, this is API
[14:47:36] <toddmparker_> awesome
[14:47:37] <agcolom> yes
[14:47:50] <toddmparker_> holy smokes
[14:47:54] <toddmparker_> that is a ton
[14:47:59] <agcolom> yes ;-)
[14:48:02] <toddmparker_> incredible work agcolom
[14:48:19] <agcolom> I am the queen of copy paste :-) makes me relax in the evening ;-)
[14:48:39] <toddmparker_> heh
[14:48:42] <toddmparker_> good for you
[14:48:50] <toddmparker_> this is hugely important
[14:49:23] <agcolom> absolutely! doctors should prescribe JQM contribution ;-)
[14:49:33] <agcolom> (against stress!)
[14:50:00] <agcolom> and for hapiness!
[14:50:36] <agcolom> on that happy note.... i will catch up with my sleep ;-)
[14:50:44] <agcolom> Goodnight again....
[14:53:45] <uGoMobi> I am off too... goodnight all
[14:55:33] <agcolom> Goodnight Jasper...
[17:38:59] <wingy> are you guys coding on jQuery Mobile on your sparetime after your ordinary job?
