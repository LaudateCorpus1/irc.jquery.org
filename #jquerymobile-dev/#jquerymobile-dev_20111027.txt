[07:13:20] <Wilto> Hey JNice: this is a room for the jQuery Mobile dev team to collaborate‚Äîgeneral support stuff would be better handled by #jquerymobile
[07:19:19] <JNice> my apologies!
[07:28:30] <Wilto> No worries, man.
[07:38:52] <toddmparker_> good morning all

[07:47:50] <toddmparker_> hey Wilto
[07:47:57] <Wilto> Heard you‚Äôre caf√©-ing it up today, toddmparker_. You hipster, you.
[07:48:06] <toddmparker_> did you see that people are saying there might still be issues with selects?
[07:48:09] <toddmparker_> i am
[07:48:14] <toddmparker_> listening to jazz and everything
[07:48:27] <toddmparker_> this beret is itchy
[07:49:35] <Wilto> I did see that‚Äîstill digging through my email, but it looked like it might have been an issue with their page. That‚Äôs first up on my hit list.
[07:49:41] <toddmparker_> hey wilto - can you test something quick for me

[07:49:43] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #2857 on jquery-mobile, reported by infomaniac50 (15h, 8m ago): Themed native select menus don't show up on Gingerbread when clicked
[07:49:56] <toddmparker_> i need to to open the ajax form test page on our 2.3 device
[07:50:07] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/forms-sample.html
[07:50:12] <toddmparker_> ^ that page
[07:50:34] <toddmparker_> does it work? do you see a transition? can you go back and submit again? etc.
[07:50:47] <toddmparker_> yeah, a lot fo issues are operator error
[07:50:51] <Wilto> Sure thing.
[07:53:28] <toddmparker_> can you comment with your test results on that issue? copy here in case i miss it
[07:53:59] <Wilto> Will do.
[07:54:19] <Wilto> ‚ÄúGo back and submit again‚Äù via a specific method? The ‚Äúchange method‚Äù, the back button, etc.?
[07:54:35] <Wilto> Seems fine so far.
[07:55:20] <Wilto> (Sorry, caught up on the thread now.)
[07:56:24] <toddmparker_> not sure, but i'd try changing shipping method & submit
[07:56:32] <toddmparker_> hit back, change and re-submit
[07:56:59] <toddmparker_> if it all works fine and you see transitions, ajax is working
[07:57:08] <toddmparker_> the second form is non-ajax (below)
[07:57:12] <toddmparker_> hey johnbender
[07:58:01] <toddmparker_> been reading thru those appcache issues
[07:58:25] <toddmparker_> sounds like your proposed approach works?

[07:59:13] <toddmparker_> could you do me a huge favor first thing and add something to the docs about this?
[07:59:41] <toddmparker_> thinking we need a phonegap page and a appcache page in the pages section
[08:00:07] <toddmparker_> even if you added these pages and dropping in a few sentences, anything, kin can help fill this out
[08:00:24] <toddmparker_> our if you wanted to jot down notes and email me, i'm happy to write soemthing
[08:00:36] <toddmparker_> this is just over me head and haven't played with it
[08:00:47] <toddmparker_> but both are things people struggle with

[08:52:41] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[08:52:46] <toddmparker_> how goes it
[08:52:54] <gseguin> good, you?
[08:53:35] <gseguin> I was telling kinblas last night that I actually can't measure any diference in Chrome :(
[08:55:14] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah that workaround is fine but we shouldn't incorporate it
[08:55:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: what did you mean by "dealign" in the email?
[08:56:07] <toddmparker_> just covering some tips and best practices. thing people have run into in the tracker
[08:56:11] <toddmparker_> johnbender:
[08:56:17] <johnbender> cool
[08:56:39] <toddmparker_> i got so much mileage out of the scripting pages and dynamic pages in the docs
[08:56:46] <toddmparker_> i can say rtfm
[08:56:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: should I give a full explanation as to what causes the issue? That might have value given that setting isLocal isn't obvious
[08:57:13] <toddmparker_> we offer no guideance on the things that need to be configured or gotcha in appcache and PG
[08:57:23] <toddmparker_> for sure
[08:57:32] <toddmparker_> i don't ever think we can over educate
[08:57:47] <toddmparker_> if we doc it, we will have fewer issues
[08:58:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright I'm about to head into the office, I'll do that first thing when I get in
[08:58:12] <toddmparker_> both of these are super hard to debug so if we can say "here's stuff you should know up front", it will help

[09:18:42] <toddmparker_> nice fix
[09:19:26] <Wilto> Pretty insane that this bug was reported to -moz in 2009.
[09:19:29] <Wilto> But here we are.
[09:20:05] <toddmparker_> fun

[09:24:17] <toddmparker_> is this worth adding now or later? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2850
[09:24:18] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #2850 on jquery-mobile, reported by topa (1d, 6h ago): Configure touchToggleEnabled on mobileinit
[09:39:18] <kinblas> toddmparker: that reminds me ... can you remind me what that touch-scroll bug was with missing content?
[09:39:21] <kinblas> what page? what content?
[09:54:36] <Wilto> kinblas: You have the issue number handy? I can try to dig up the details.
[09:55:27] <kinblas> Wilto: heh, nope, I don't even know if there was an issue filed ... I think scott put something on the body/page to hide the problem
[09:55:56] <kinblas> Wilto: hang on I think I have last week's meeting log
[09:56:31] <Wilto> WHAT THE HELL SCOTT
[09:57:22] <Wilto> I hope he doesn‚Äôt read through his IRC logs when he gets back, because I intend to blame him for everything that goes wrong in his absence.
[09:57:48] <Wilto> Including, like, train delays.
[09:58:00] <gseguin> :)
[09:58:27] <kinblas> heh
[09:58:38] <kinblas> Wilto: Todd referenced this in the IRC log https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2716#issuecomment-2421617
[09:58:39] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #2716 on jquery-mobile, reported by MauriceG (1w, 4d ago): iOS5 and touchOverflow
[09:58:51] <Wilto> Ah-hah.
[09:59:51] <Wilto> That transform added when touchOverflow is enabled automatically makes everything position: relative;
[10:00:08] <Wilto> So if stuff‚Äôs being hidden when touchOverflow is turned on, it‚Äôs likely related to that.
[10:51:51] <gseguin> kinblas: why do I get 2 pagecreate events on load?
[10:53:54] <kinblas> gseguin: are you using a multi-page document?
[10:54:01] * kinblas wonders if the "loading dialog" is a page
[10:54:12] <gseguin> nope, only one page in my document
[10:54:22] * gseguin is double checking
[10:54:27] <kinblas> gseguin hang on let me check
[10:55:03] <gseguin> kinblas: yep, double checked got only one role=page div in there
[10:56:40] <kinblas> gseguin: I just checked ... I se only one pagecreate
[10:56:41] <kinblas> OH
[10:56:46] <kinblas> are you using chrome?
[10:56:50] <gseguin> yes
[10:56:53] <kinblas> heh
[10:56:55] <kinblas> Chrome has a bug
[10:56:57] <gseguin> oh
[10:57:01] <kinblas> where it duplicates log content
[10:57:06] <johnbender> yar!
[10:57:09] <johnbender> screw that bug
[10:57:09] <kinblas> I filed a bug against them
[10:57:25] <kinblas> gseguin: the way to verify
[10:57:30] <kinblas> to include
[10:57:41] <kinblas> http://jquerymobile.com/test/tools/log-page-events.js
[10:57:48] <kinblas> and watch the console when you open/reload the page
[10:58:02] <kinblas> when you spew enough debug info to the console, it avoids that bug
[10:58:13] <Wilto> DAMMIT SCOTT
[10:58:17] <kinblas> lol
[10:58:24] <gseguin> lol
[10:58:41] <gseguin> well it seems to happen in safari as well
[10:58:53] <gseguin> let me put that in a jsbin
[10:59:05] <kinblas> ok ... can you include the script above too?
[10:59:19] <gseguin> yep
[10:59:19] <kinblas> I have a simple example
[10:59:23] <kinblas> and I'm only seeing one pagecreate
[11:02:47] <gseguin> kinblas: http://jsbin.com/osukaz/4
[11:03:08] <gseguin> brb
[11:04:31] <kinblas> gseguin: hmmm, that url is hanging for me
[11:06:15] <gseguin> hmm, interesting
[11:07:31] <eddiemonge> wfm
[11:08:01] <gseguin> eddiemonge: in the console, do you see pagecreate happening twice?
[11:14:26] <gseguin> looks like irccloud is choking
[11:14:39] <gseguin> eddiemonge: did you get my last message
[11:14:40] <gseguin> ?
[11:15:06] <eddiemonge> gseguin: yeah
[11:15:20] <eddiemonge> i see pagecreate followed by pagecreate some other stuff
[11:15:39] <gseguin> kinblas: still not working for you?
[11:15:46] <eddiemonge> oh wait, jk wrong thing
[11:15:55] <eddiemonge> actually i do see it twice though and its not a chrome bug
[11:16:05] <gseguin> right?
[11:17:12] <eddiemonge> https://skitch.com/etiger13/grb2u/double-pagecreate
[11:17:14] <Wilto> Ugh. Way to be, IRCCloud.
[11:17:59] <eddiemonge> kinblas: does that work for you ^^^  cc gseguin
[11:18:27] <eddiemonge> everything is kind of doubled up except for pagebeforechange
[11:20:44] <kinblas> gseguin: not sure what's up but that url is hanging ... and sometimes it finishes and I only see the unstyled content
[11:21:08] <gseguin> is adobe blocking dyndns content?
[11:21:09] <kinblas> gseguin: and that's both chrome and Safari
[11:21:18] <kinblas> yeah
[11:21:22] <gseguin> ah crap!
[11:21:24] <kinblas> but you were using jsbin right?
[11:21:32] <gseguin> way to go adobe
[11:21:38] <kinblas> oh you referred to your site js
[11:22:08] <kinblas> gseguin: yeah they've been strict since that big google attack
[11:22:46] <kinblas> gseguin: I'll copy your source and try locally
[11:23:31] <gseguin> http://jsbin.com/osukaz/5
[11:24:10] <gseguin> kinblas: ^^^ uses jquerymobile.com, same problem
[11:27:23] <kinblas> gseguin: oh heh
[11:27:32] <kinblas> that 2nd page is the dialog for one of your custom selects
[11:27:41] <gseguin> oh darn ok
[11:27:55] <kinblas> if you look at the output from that bookmarklet js file you linked in
[11:28:03] <kinblas> it shows you what element is being processed
[11:28:05] <kinblas> first one is the page
[11:28:11] <kinblas> the 2nd one has no identifiers on it
[11:28:22] <kinblas> so looking at the resulting markup
[11:28:26] <kinblas> you see 3 divs
[11:28:38] <kinblas> first-page, load dialog, custom select page

[11:29:23] <kinblas> gseguin: no problemo
[11:29:37] <kinblas> I was sweatin it, thought I introduced some bug recently
[11:30:01] <johnbender> toddparker: not sure if that's where you want it but I added as section covering the issue with application cache
[11:30:09] <johnbender> or even if that's what you had in mind
[11:30:36] <johnbender> I honestly wouldn't know what guidance to provide on when/how to use the app cache since that seems so application specific

[11:34:53] <johnbender> not I
[11:35:00] <johnbender> had me confused there

[11:39:30] <Wilto> Still nada. Stupid clouds.
[11:52:45] <kinblas> Wilto: you figure out that select-not-working on Android problem?
[11:53:03] <Wilto> kinblas: Yes indeed.
[11:53:17] <kinblas> Wilto: negative offsets again?
[11:53:29] <kinblas> what was the problem?
[11:53:35] <kinblas> why only after page transition?
[11:53:53] <Wilto> Yep. Both in numerical and opposite-of-positive terms.
[11:54:42] <Wilto> There‚Äôs something else involved that‚Äôs triggering it, but replacing position: fixed; on those hidden headings in favor of another approach solved, y‚Äôknow, the symptom.
[11:55:20] <Wilto> If you open up the form example page on Android 2.2/2.3, you‚Äôll notice the custom select seems to be retaining focus either after it‚Äôs opened, or when you AJAX in the page.
[11:55:42] <Wilto> For some reason that was blowing out seemingly unrelated things with that position: fixed in there.
[11:56:45] <Wilto> Lots of voodoo in play, here. I‚Äôm still planning on tracking down this focus issue later today, time permitting.
[11:57:42] <kinblas> ok great!
[11:58:22] <Wilto> Though I did pick up a sacrificial chicken when I went out to get lunch earlier, just in case.
[11:58:22] <kinblas> fyi, I know in the navigation code we track last focused element for previously visited pages, not sure how that's different now that we purge pages
[11:58:28] <kinblas> lol
[11:58:35] <Wilto> Is that so!
[11:58:51] <kinblas> Wilto: yeah you may want to poke around in there
[11:58:55] <Wilto> Yes indeed.
[11:58:55] <kinblas> it's been the source of several bugs
[11:59:11] <kinblas> one of them being offset rendering when it is triggered at a bad time
[11:59:25] <Wilto> Interesting.
[11:59:35] <kinblas> that is
[11:59:46] <kinblas> the browser will make every effort to bring whatever is focused into view
[11:59:59] <kinblas> even if it means offsetting the rendering of the container it is in
[12:00:03] <kinblas> if it can't scroll
[12:00:21] <Wilto> This is sounding more and more familiar.
[12:00:27] <Wilto> Yeah, I‚Äôll check that out a little later on.
[12:00:37] <kinblas> yeah, so that's why we tried triggering it *AFTER* the silent scroll
[12:05:30] <Wilto> And then interacting with it obviously changes focus, at which point the same bugs start popping up. So, hm.

[13:16:40] <Wilto> johnbender: Whenever you‚Äôre back, do you know what parts of this monstrous install I can omit to still get the emulator? I assume, like, ‚ÄúVisual Basic.‚Äù
[13:17:25] <Wilto> Also, I‚Äôm hereby revoking my own right to take meeting notes.

[13:21:01] <jqm-jenkins-bot> jakeboone02: Grammar correction
[13:24:29] <eddiemonge> Wilto: why? i think you did superbly
[13:25:00] <Wilto> Ah, as long as the real info came across okay. Twitter has ruined me for text-based communication, really.
[13:26:10] <Wilto> Even the INSTALLER for Visual Studio is inscrutable.
[13:29:34] <eddiemonge> install win8 then you get all
[13:29:35] <eddiemonge> i think
[13:31:05] <Wilto> C#? F#?
[13:31:11] <Wilto> Visual C++?
[14:02:16] <gseguin> kinblas: let me know when you've done your measurements
[14:02:32] <gseguin> and I'd like to know what I'm missing too
[14:02:41] <kinblas> gseguin: will do
[14:02:56] <johnbender> Wilto: are you doing the visual studio install?
[14:03:06] <johnbender> you can get rid of almost all of it save for the visual c#
[14:03:06] <Wilto> Against my better judgement, yeah.
[14:03:15] <Wilto> Ah-hah, that‚Äôs what I was looking for.
[14:03:22] <johnbender> I kept f# because I have an interest in functional programming
[14:03:22] <kinblas> isn't there a VS Express?
[14:03:35] <johnbender> kinblas: there is but that's not necessarily a faster install
[14:03:40] <johnbender> it's just a hamstrung version
[14:03:51] <kinblas> express != faster
[14:03:53] <kinblas> heh
[14:04:00] <johnbender> I have a whole rant prepared on why ms should give away their dev tools for personal use
[14:04:40] <johnbender> Wolfgang Puck Express is to Wolfgang Puck as Visual Studio Express is to Visual Studio
[14:07:51] <Wilto> Visual Studio : Code Editor :: Cardboard : Food
[14:08:09] <Wilto> I mean, yeah. You can use it to edit code/eat it. Technically.
[14:09:17] <johnbender> Wilto: in the same way the eclipse is a really nice tool for working with Java (to the point that it's odd to use anything that doesn't have a similar feature set) Visual Studio is a great editor for .NET languages and the runtime
[14:09:47] <Wilto> Ah, yeah, there‚Äôs my bias. I‚Äôm terrified of that .NET business.
[14:09:53] <johnbender> unless I was working on an asp.net project I wouldn't use it as my markup, stylesheet, or js editor
[14:10:13] <johnbender> intellisense is really nice
[14:10:29] * johnbender was a .NET dev for 2 years
[14:11:03] <Wilto> I uh I wrote some PHP one time.
[14:11:26] <Wilto> The emotional scars will last a lifetime, though.

[14:35:56] <Wilto> Yeah?
[14:35:56] <johnbender> it works fine
[14:36:19] <johnbender> if I cache the selected item in the enclosing scope
[14:36:24] <Wilto> ‚Ä¶Just by introducing that delay?
[14:36:25] <johnbender> I can reproduce the issue
[14:36:26] <johnbender> yes
[14:36:28] <Wilto> Ah man, gross.
[14:36:28] <johnbender> the delay

[14:51:22] <Wilto> Well, hey‚Äîthe good news is that we know how it‚Äôs busted.

[15:29:05] <toddmparker_> i'm back
[15:31:24] <gseguin> toddmparker_: why do you have several handles? Aren't you using IRCCloud ?
[15:34:05] <toddmparker_> hey guys, i'm back
[15:34:36] <toddmparker_> i'm using ircloud and colloquy at the same time. thus the massive name confusion
[15:35:29] <gseguin> What features of Colloquy are you missing in IRCCloud?
[15:43:28] <toddmparker_> nothing really, i just sort of like having a true app so i can switch to it
[15:43:36] <toddmparker_> more that i'm lazy and confused
[15:43:54] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin johnbender kinblas - what do we think about this
[15:43:55] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2066#issuecomment-2549976
[15:43:55] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #2066 on jquery-mobile, reported by ryantofteland (3m, 2w ago): Select Menus won't open when pages are within FORM element
[15:44:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: It's a hard thing to work around from our side with potentially messing things up for other people
[15:44:33] <toddmparker_> the bigger issue is whether we cna support a form around pages in general. sure selects aren't the only issue
[15:44:56] <johnbender> actually I need to ask the asp.net guys about that too
[15:45:17] <johnbender> added to my todo for the meeting tomorrow
[15:49:20] <johnbender> Wilto: ui-btn ui-btn-icon-right ui-btn-corner-all ui-btn-hover-c ui-shadow
[15:49:36] <johnbender> that set of classes also prevents the issue when it's on the select button
[15:50:02] <johnbender> I've been logging the state of the classes on the underlying button when things are broken/working
[15:50:12] <johnbender> err
[15:50:29] <johnbender> the parent button that's underneath it on the z axis
[15:59:57] <toddmparker_> thanks johnbender
[16:00:37] <toddmparker_> remember how we were talking about the dialog overlay theme
[16:00:45] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yessir
[16:02:06] <toddmparker_> the interesting thing is if you have a dialog and add a data-theme to the page wrapper of the dialog, it seems to set both the overlay and content block to that theme:
[16:02:07] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/ejesod/11
[16:02:12] <toddmparker_> which is unexpected to me
[16:02:25] <toddmparker_> seems like that worked differently before
[16:02:30] <toddmparker_> the overlay was hard coded to a
[16:03:01] <toddmparker_> in the current system, setting the theme on the page sets the overlay and content
[16:03:19] <toddmparker_> so if you then add a theme to the content, you can sort fo control them both
[16:03:27] <toddmparker_> but it works unexpectedly
[16:03:37] <toddmparker_> i'll note this when I make that issue
[16:03:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kk that might be part of the change that kin made to centralize the theme inheritance bit eh?
[16:04:18] <toddmparker_> yeah, might be overreaching
[16:04:30] <toddmparker_> but i can do this by setting the 2 theme attrs
[16:04:30] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/ejesod/12
[16:05:27] <toddmparker_> http://jsbin.com/ejesod/14
[16:05:40] <toddmparker_> actually, dialogs look odd in this multipage setup
[16:05:48] <toddmparker_> they aren't being styled right
[16:06:02] <toddmparker_> need to look at this more after i put the kids down
[16:07:21] <kinblas> johnbender: eh? did I introduce a bug?
[16:09:31] <toddmparker_> not sure
[16:09:37] <toddmparker_> i'll check in later

[16:26:01] <eddiemonge> how does twitter have such super smooth page transitions?
[16:31:40] <johnbender> kinblas: looks like there are some tests to change associated with that patch that gseguin reverted
[16:32:13] <johnbender> zero progress on this Mango issue today
[16:32:17] * johnbender sigh
[16:32:25] <johnbender> all day
[16:32:38] <gseguin> johnbender: I'm trying to implement a test for that issue
[16:32:45] <gseguin> no luck so far
[16:32:58] <johnbender> gseguin: which is that the Mango problem or the patch you reverted
[16:33:00] <johnbender> ?
[16:33:12] <gseguin> nope the issue I reverted the failed fix for
[16:33:31] <gseguin> sorry I thought that was what you were talking about
[16:33:41] <johnbender> gseguin: I had two threads running :D
[16:35:17] <gseguin> any idea on how to test that?
[16:35:37] <gseguin> I've tried resetting the $.mobile.urlHistory.stack
[16:35:44] <gseguin> to simulate first load
[16:35:51] <gseguin> but it's not really working
[16:38:10] <johnbender> gseguin: do you have a link to the issue?
[16:38:22] <johnbender> gseguin: worst case you can create it's own page for the test
[16:38:36] * gseguin retrieves link
[16:38:47] <gseguin> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2865
[16:38:48] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #2865 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (7h, 21m ago): Page title overridden on first load
[16:39:32] <gseguin> so basically if you click here: http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-dialogs.html
[16:39:52] <gseguin> the title should be "jQuery Mobile Docs - Dialogs"
[16:40:03] <gseguin> not "Dialogs"
[16:40:37] <johnbender> gseguin: so are you trying to fix existing tests or create new one?
[16:40:41] <johnbender> create a new one?
[16:40:48] <gseguin> create a new one
[16:41:02] <gseguin> yeah yeah the existing ones are fine
[16:41:12] <gseguin> and I have a fix that doesn't break them
[16:43:15] <johnbender> gseguin: the test is really just that if there isn't a data-title attribute on the new page it will prefer the document.title right?
[16:43:19] <johnbender> where it's defined
[16:43:52] <johnbender> even if there's a header with content in it
[16:44:03] <gseguin> it should always prefer the document.title
[16:44:17] <gseguin> shouldn't it?
[16:44:50] <johnbender> gseguin: it will prefer the toPage's data-title right now according that patch eh?
[16:44:54] <johnbender> sorry
[16:44:58] <johnbender> just looking at what that patch does
[16:45:20] <johnbender> I take it your proposed fix is different?
[16:45:26] <gseguin> yes
[16:45:34] <johnbender> gseguin: can you gist the `git diff` output?
[16:45:39] <johnbender> is it just a change to that line?
[16:45:49] <gseguin> var newPageTitle = ( !active )? pageTitle : toPage.jqmData( "title" ) || toPage.children(":jqmData(role='header')").find(".ui-title" ).getEncodedText();
[16:46:46] <johnbender> gseguin: is that !active meant to signify that there's no history
[16:46:47] <johnbender> ?
[16:46:58] <gseguin> yes
[16:48:16] <johnbender> gseguin: this won't matter once these all run in an iframe :(
[16:48:27] <johnbender> useless commentary
[16:48:57] <johnbender> gseguin: I would just give it it's own test page in nav
[16:49:11] <johnbender> I'm sure there's a clever way we could do this but it's the easiest way
[16:49:39] <gseguin> ok I'll poke around
[16:49:46] <johnbender> /tests/unit/navigation/first-load-title-tests.html
[16:50:03] <gseguin> and will resort to that if I can't outsmart the test framework
[16:50:07] <johnbender> the -tests.html will get picked up by the suite
[16:50:16] <gseguin> oh cool
[16:50:16] <johnbender> gseguin: yah don't waste too much time
[16:50:20] <gseguin> thanks for the tip
[16:50:40] <johnbender> we need to fix the bigger state problem post 1.0 so any cleverness will be wasted
[16:52:47] <toddmparker_> hey guys, i'm back
[16:58:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright I'm heading back to my casa
[16:58:59] <johnbender> only a very little progress on the Mango issue
[16:59:07] <johnbender> just some noted behavior
[16:59:10] <johnbender> nothing super helpful
[16:59:12] <johnbender> :( :(
[17:00:35] <toddmparker_> well mat can take a look tomorrow
[17:00:45] <toddmparker_> he is the master of troubleshooting this kind of stuff
[17:00:58] <toddmparker_> get back to programming you neck beard :p

[17:15:51] <eddiemonge> just push it
[17:15:58] <eddiemonge> we can do it now and announce it later
[17:27:11] <toddmparker_> no, let's wait
[17:27:25] <toddmparker_> just wanted to know if i had to remove p/e protection when we launch
[17:27:51] <toddmparker_> gesguin - you still here
[17:27:58] <gseguin> I ma
[17:28:13] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: ill be around tomorrow in case
[17:28:17] <gseguin> same keyboard looks like ;)
[17:28:20] <toddmparker_> thanks eddiemonge
[17:28:40] <gseguin> toddmparker_: 'sup?

[17:29:14] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #2847 on jquery-mobile, reported by fudder (2d, 1h ago): Search inputs: Clear control does not react to cut and paste events in iOS
[17:30:01] <gseguin> ok
[17:30:10] <toddmparker_> seems like a quick fix
[17:30:19] <toddmparker_> this is the relevant bit of code:
[17:30:24] <toddmparker_> input.keyup( toggleClear )
[17:30:24] <toddmparker_> 				.focus( toggleClear );
[17:30:54] <toddmparker_> looks like we're looking at keyup and focus, but if you copy/paste neither are triggered in iOS
[17:31:01] <toddmparker_> change might be better
[17:31:14] <toddmparker_> but do we add that or change keyup to change?
[17:31:28] <gseguin> hmm
[17:31:47] <eddiemonge> change wont fire until you leave the field though
[17:32:06] <gseguin> does it fire on paste?
[17:32:11] <eddiemonge> no
[17:32:19] <eddiemonge> only on blur i think
[17:32:24] <toddmparker_> i see
[17:32:51] <toddmparker_> so is there a more granular change-type event that's not keyup?
[17:33:26] <eddiemonge> this is specifically for iOS right?
[17:33:29] <toddmparker_> yeah, change only works on blur
[17:33:32] <toddmparker_> yep
[17:33:43] <eddiemonge> .bind("onpaste") might work
[17:33:58] <gseguin> yeah I was going to suggest something like that
[17:34:09] <gseguin> wasn't sure about the event name
[17:34:47] <toddmparker_> found it!
[17:34:48] <toddmparker_> http://developer.apple.com/library/IOS/#documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/HandlingEvents/HandlingEvents.html
[17:34:58] <toddmparker_> there are cut and paste events in ios
[17:35:24] <gseguin> cool
[17:35:26] <toddmparker_> crap
[17:35:31] <gseguin> what?
[17:35:38] <toddmparker_> that table lists them, but is says n/a
[17:36:00] <toddmparker_> scroll to the bottom of that page
[17:36:01] <gseguin> oh  yeah Generated: No
[17:36:12] <toddmparker_> why list it?!?
[17:36:21] <gseguin> I know, right?!
[17:36:31] <toddmparker_> so not fixable then
[17:36:53] <eddiemonge> got an iOS device handy? try this http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/prUdy/1/
[17:37:47] * gseguin tries
[17:38:00] <toddmparker_> yep
[17:38:32] <toddmparker_> does fiddle open in ios?
[17:38:35] <gseguin> works
[17:38:37] <toddmparker_> fiddle is such a mess
[17:38:40] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[17:39:11] <gseguin> toddmparker_: go to http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/prUdy/1/show/light
[17:39:21] <eddiemonge> if you add /show at the end of a jsfiddle it works just like pastebin or what ever else the url is
[17:39:30] <toddmparker_> ah
[17:39:56] <eddiemonge> guess i should have pasted the real link http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/prUdy/1/show/
[17:39:58] <gseguin> oh eddiemonge is /show enough?
[17:40:04] <eddiemonge> yeah
[17:40:19] <toddmparker_> good to know
[17:40:27] <toddmparker_> so i see the paste event working
[17:40:31] <toddmparker_> cut doesn't seem to work
[17:40:34] <gseguin> well I've been waisting keystrokes all this time
[17:40:47] <toddmparker_> ah, you only have paste there
[17:40:54] <gseguin> he didn;t map it
[17:41:00] <gseguin> s/map/bind
[17:41:04] <toddmparker_> yeah, just looked at the code :)
[17:41:10] <toddmparker_> was too busy typing that into ios
[17:41:34] <gseguin> alright so adding paste/cut
[17:41:37] <eddiemonge> so you can do .bind('paste cut keyup focus change blur', toggleClear)
[17:41:43] <toddmparker_> so if this works, should we add cut and paste to the triggers?
[17:42:06] <eddiemonge> id have all of them because all of those affect text
[17:42:38] <toddmparker_> eddie - mind making a pull request?
[17:43:11] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge ^
[17:43:24] <eddiemonge> lol i dont even really know what the original issue is

[17:43:49] <eddiemonge> i just say you ask about pasting something and binding to that
[17:43:55] <toddmparker_> i don't allow myself to make JS changes anymore. i break things
[17:44:13] <eddiemonge> me too
[17:44:19] <eddiemonge> like i broke buttons in ie8
[17:44:24] <gseguin> toddmparker_: does that mean I should stop too ?
[17:44:25] <gseguin> :)
[17:44:37] <toddmparker_> no, you know your stuff gseguin
[17:44:42] <toddmparker_> you too eddiemonge
[17:44:59] <toddmparker_> it's just in jquery.mobile.forms.textinput.js
[17:45:09] <eddiemonge> actually this whole file seems like it could use a touchup
[17:45:12] <toddmparker_> a quick change now that we know this works
[17:45:49] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: do you have an ios device to test this on
[17:46:13] <eddiemonge> not with me. not until later tonight
[17:46:30] <eddiemonge> i can test against 5 and 4.3
[17:46:43] <toddmparker_> if you suggest the fix, i can test and pull it in
[17:47:10] <toddmparker_> unless gseguin just wants to make the fix
[17:47:16] <toddmparker_> he has the skills and the device
[17:48:01] <gseguin> I don't mind making the fix

[17:49:16] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: there are a bunch of places
[17:49:22] <toddmparker_> not need to mess with those now
[17:49:28] <toddmparker_> we need to re-visit after 1.0
[17:50:12] <toddmparker_> gseguin: cool, go for it
[17:52:30] <gseguin> hmm it ain't working
[17:53:42] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[17:53:44] <toddmparker_> bummer
[17:53:51] <gseguin> the bind work
[17:53:51] <gseguin> s
[17:53:59] <toddmparker_> by did the fiddle throw the alerts then?
[17:54:01] <gseguin> the toggleClear doesn't
[17:54:10] <toddmparker_> really?
[17:54:12] <gseguin> looking into it

[17:59:49] <eddiemonge> try that
[17:59:59] <eddiemonge> oh toddmparker_ this is a mobile issue: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2838#issuecomment-2551297
[18:00:00] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Issue #2838 on jquery-mobile, reported by eddiemonge (2d, 7h ago): jQuery UI widget version unknown
[18:01:09] <gseguin> eddiemonge: did you change anything else but the bind ?
[18:01:24] <eddiemonge> maybe
[18:01:37] <eddiemonge> i may have tried to sneak in a few other changes as well
[18:01:38] <gseguin> it'd be better to keep the code formatting in a separate commit/
[18:01:42] <toddmparker_> i just tested that pull and it doesn't work :(
[18:01:49] <gseguin> yeah
[18:01:57] <toddmparker_> +1 to the separation
[18:02:03] <gseguin> if it's the bind it doesn't work
[18:02:11] <gseguin> that's what I've done
[18:02:19] <gseguin> it's weird though
[18:02:32] <gseguin> toggleClear gets triggered
[18:03:15] <eddiemonge> can you add alerts to the if statements to see which gets fired, if either
[18:05:09] <gseguin> so when you paste that does not change the input.val()
[18:05:54] <eddiemonge> i wonder if paste is fired before the paste happens
[18:07:28] <eddiemonge> yeah, the paste event is like a keydown
[18:07:33] <eddiemonge> it fires then does the action
[18:07:45] <eddiemonge> http://jsfiddle.net/prUdy/4/show
[18:08:37] <gseguin> I've gotta run
[18:08:50] <gseguin> I'll try to address that tonight or tomorrow morning
[18:09:05] <eddiemonge> ive got it i think
[18:11:00] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: try this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2874

[18:11:24] <toddmparker_> ok gseguin
[18:11:32] <toddmparker_> i'll test eddiemonge's pull
[18:13:09] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: it works!
[18:14:12] <eddiemonge> i think that should be pretty safe other devices too, unless they dont like settimeout
[18:14:38] <toddmparker_> gseguin: you still here?
[18:14:53] <toddmparker_> johnbender: you here?
[18:15:24] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: looking for a second opinion on the settimeout
[18:15:39] <toddmparker_> it works, but is it "ok"
[18:16:24] <eddiemonge> its kind of a hacky workaround but since its not changing any default behavior should be fine
[18:16:41] <eddiemonge> but a second opinion on my logic would be good
[18:17:17] <eddiemonge> only thing that might concern me is all the stuff im binding to in it
[18:17:29] <eddiemonge> did you try cutting text?
[18:17:44] <eddiemonge> or having a box with an initial value?
[18:19:36] <eddiemonge> time to go home-ish but ill be back on in about an hour and half if you need me to change something in

[19:27:08] <johnbender> toddparker: toddmparker_: ^^
[19:28:13] <toddmparker_> aw man
[19:29:10] <toddmparker_> johnbender: can you take a look and see what's up with that? I tested this and he included new unit tests so it seemed solid
[19:29:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: one of the merges was a bit code change
[19:29:31] <johnbender> I commented on commit in github
[19:29:36] <johnbender> *big code change
[19:29:38] <johnbender> which makes me warry
[19:29:43] <johnbender> wary
[19:29:46] <toddmparker_> oh, big sorry
[19:30:21] <toddmparker_> want to revert until you guys can review in more detail. sorry, i should never pull in stuff
[19:32:12] <toddmparker_> the current flip switch is sort fo broken b/c it gets stuck in the middle
[19:32:16] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I was just thinking since the ticket it closes is so low priority maybe it could wait
[19:32:21] <toddmparker_> but maybe there is a less intrusive fix
[19:32:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yah I saw that
[19:32:33] <johnbender> hasn't always been like that though eh?
[19:32:44] <toddmparker_> i think it's gotten worse recently
[19:32:58] <toddmparker_> it was getting stuck in odd places recently
[19:33:00] <johnbender> alright it might be good to find out what the underlying cause is with a bisect
[19:33:09] <johnbender> yah I don't think it was like that back in the day
[19:33:24] <toddmparker_> i'll defer to you on figuring out what to do
[19:33:40] <toddmparker_> feel free to revert and see if you can find where things went wrong
[19:33:51] <toddmparker_> maybe around rc 1, maybe 2
[19:33:55] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kk
[19:33:56] <johnbender> will do
[19:34:05] <johnbender> I'll do the bisect before reverting
[19:34:12] <toddmparker_> i'll stick to writing blog posts :)
[19:34:16] <johnbender> haha not at all
[19:34:20] <johnbender> just saw the build broke
[19:34:25] <johnbender> otherwise I might not have known
[19:45:20] <johnbender> toddmparker_: 4fa6ccdc0d8625f58e43e446f24bc4e65f87cb1d
[19:46:28] <toddmparker_> that's the place it broke?
[19:46:30] <johnbender> yessir

[19:46:36] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Commit on jquery-mobile by jblas (1m, 4d ago): Fix for issue 2315 - Flip toggle switch with change event bound, triggers multiple times- Modified refresh() so that it checks to see if the value actually changed before firing off the "change" event.
[19:46:39] <johnbender> makes sense
[19:46:43] <toddmparker_> kin is fired
[19:46:52] <toddmparker_> yep
[19:47:05] <johnbender> so I think we can consult with him and fix the change with something trivial
[19:47:09] <johnbender> which would be good
[19:47:28] <johnbender> toddmparker_: why don't I do that after our call tomorrow
[19:47:36] <johnbender> I need a quick win after a day with this Mango bug
[19:47:50] <toddmparker_> seriously
[19:47:50] * johnbender feels a bit low
[19:47:53] <toddmparker_> go for it
[19:48:05] <toddmparker_> i hope mat can take a look at that for ya
[19:48:11] <toddmparker_> remind him tomorrow
[19:49:39] <johnbender> cool, hopefully a fresh set of eyes on the css will make it obvious
[19:49:53] <johnbender>  I'll be happy to be embarassed if we can find a quick fix for that one
[19:50:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: as a side note the bisect I performed and that commit kin made are a prime example of how small commits makes finding bugs easy with git
[19:51:12] <toddmparker_> yeah. i need a bisect lesson
[19:51:13] <johnbender> so even if he did introduce a bug, because his commit was tiny it made it super easy to diagnose/find
[19:51:35] <toddmparker_> small, discrete commits are a very good thing
[19:59:52] <toddmparker_> hey guy - just noticed that we don't include any license file like core does
[19:59:59] <toddmparker_> should i drop those in from core?
[20:00:07] <eddiemonge> where?
[20:00:20] <toddmparker_> they are in the root of the repo for core
[20:01:00] <toddmparker_> and for ui
[20:01:03] <toddmparker_> gonna add 'em
[20:01:37] <eddiemonge> ugh. i just got done getting rid of them in the minified versions
[20:01:53] <toddmparker_> they don't need to be there
[20:01:58] <eddiemonge> but in the root doesnt matter i guess
[20:02:09] <toddmparker_> these are just in the root of the repo, not in the concat files
[20:02:33] <eddiemonge> well the min versions still have a license, its a minified license similar to what core did this month
[20:03:05] <eddiemonge> you saw that right: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/2840
[20:03:06] <socialhapy> ‚òÖ Pull request on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (2d, 8h ago): Standardize licenses in files and match jQuery core min license in min fi
[20:04:18] <toddmparker_> i didn't but that's cool. just a link
[20:04:40] <toddmparker_> but it seems like having the files in the repo are convention so we should do both me thinks
[21:19:07] <gseguin> I'm back
[21:19:56] <gseguin> eddiemonge: you there?
[21:19:56] <eddiemonge> cool, then could you double check my work on the pr?
[21:20:08] <gseguin> I will
[21:29:28] <gseguin> eddiemonge: if there is no other way then the setTimeout will work but should we keep the setTimeout just for paste and cut?
[21:29:43] <eddiemonge> probably
[21:29:59] <eddiemonge> but i didnt really see a downside for having it for the others either since it doesnt prevent their actions
[21:30:47] <gseguin> I just don't like setTimeouts
[21:33:28] <eddiemonge> if you have another way of letting the event happen and then firing the action im all ears
[21:40:02] <eddiemonge> since the "paste" event is pre-pasting happening so the value hasnt changed yet
[22:05:11] <gseguin> Yeah I can't think of a way to do without a timeout
