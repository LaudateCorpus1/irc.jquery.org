[08:27:08] <toddparker> hi all
[08:27:18] <toddparker> did some little edits over the weekend on docs
[08:37:09] <Wilto> TODD BROKE THE BUILD GUYS
[08:57:49] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #1,395: STILL FAILING in 24 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/1395/
[09:02:54] <kinblas> toddparker: ping
[09:03:22] <kinblas> toddparker: not sure if you saw John's reply in one of those build bustage messages, but he said that the test does rely on width
[09:29:01] <Wilto> Sorting that now, kinblas.
[09:29:51] <kinblas> Wilto: thanks!
[09:54:38] <johnbender> Wilto: toddparker: looking at that test failure
[09:54:47] <Wilto> Oh, I’ve got it here.
[09:54:56] <johnbender> Wilto: did you sort out the issue?
[09:55:03] <Wilto> It looks like a rounding error—we just gotta give the test a pixel or two of breathing room.
[09:55:26] <Wilto> If I make the width divisible by 2, we’re good. One pixel under/over, and it breaks.
[09:55:56] <johnbender> Wilto: ah
[09:56:04] <johnbender> I see why
[09:56:15] <Wilto> MATHS. http://wil.to/_/how-do-they-work.jpg
[09:56:19] <johnbender> hmm
[09:56:23] <johnbender> I take that back
[09:56:42] <Wilto> Hm?
[09:56:49] <Wilto> Am I wrong? I wouldn’t be surprised.
[09:56:54] <johnbender> not sure
[09:57:09] <johnbender> I thought it was obvious but it pads it by 10, unless a float value somehow screws the whole thing up
[09:57:38] <johnbender> ah
[09:57:39] <johnbender> nevermined
[09:57:43] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #1,396: STILL FAILING in 24 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/1396/
[09:57:46] <johnbender> yah we should just be able to pad the result
[10:00:11] <johnbender> I assume you're looking at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/tests/unit/slider/slider_events.js#L275
[10:00:34] <johnbender> or that chunk of code at least
[10:00:37] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[10:01:06] <Wilto> Cheah.
[10:02:45] <johnbender> Wilto: yah ( width / 2 ) => ( width / 2 + 10 ) sorts it
[10:03:13] <johnbender> Wilto: though we should deal with generally
[10:03:57] <johnbender> Wilto: pushing
[10:04:14] <Wilto> Oh, awesome. Thanks, dude.
[10:05:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/nECY4g
[10:05:43] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] short term fix for exact middle calculation in slider test - John Bender
[10:06:03] <johnbender> toddparker: I'm going to be dividing my time between pull requests and sorting out this rails + jqm blog post
[10:14:07] <Wilto> Todd is stuck in a meeting, but that sounds good to me—I’ll pass that along.
[10:14:40] <Wilto> I’m gonna be on client work the latter part of the day, methinks.
[10:14:41] <johnbender> gseguin: one thing I'm going to cover is using amd and the rails pipeline
[10:23:23] <LakWork> something i noticed. the default structure file defines that ui-input-text at 450px+ wide screen have 97% width instead of 100% width. this looks unfortunate when you have a textbox that should fill the screen
[10:23:36] <LakWork> at least when viewed on a high resolution
[10:23:40] <LakWork> http://mt.scorebiginc.com
[10:24:01] <johnbender> LakWork: it's expecting a label me-thinks
[10:24:06] <LakWork> ahh
[10:24:29] <johnbender> LakWork: should be a quick css fix either way though
[10:25:41] <LakWork> just checkin, thanks!
[10:33:09] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Yippie, build fixed!
[10:33:09] <jqm-jenkins-bot> Project jqm-master build #1,397: FIXED in 25 min: http://10.59.19.240:8080/job/jqm-master/1397/
[10:33:10] <jqm-jenkins-bot> john.m.bender: short term fix for exact middle calculation in slider test
[10:35:56] <LakWork> are there any techniques i can use to ensure that the content of my page always pushes the footer to the bottom of the screen without fixing it? I dont want fixed footer functionality, just the ability to make sure the page always fills the window
[10:36:15] <LakWork> even if it is just a bunch of whitespace
[10:36:38] <johnbender> kinblas: I should have said this earlier but the place to ask those sorts of questions is #jquerymobile
[10:36:47] <johnbender> ugh
[10:36:49] <johnbender> wrong person
[10:36:58] <LakWork> oh i figured
[10:36:59] <johnbender> LakWork: I should have said this earlier but the place to ask those sorts of questions is #jquerymobile
[10:37:03] <LakWork> it's just a graveyard in there
[10:37:18] <LakWork> but no worries i'll carry it over there
[10:37:32] <Wilto> YEAH, KINBLAS. GET OUTTA HERE.
[10:37:46] <LakWork> :]
[10:38:23] <kinblas> lol
[10:43:29] <LakWork> at least in here i get someone telling me to go to another room. in there it's crickets :'(
[10:43:43] <johnbender> :(
[11:02:31] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl created dialog-out (+1 new commit): http://git.io/6AQ_kw
[11:02:31] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/dialog-out] Allow for dialogs to hang onto their background color during out transitions, as it often looks better that way, particularly when themed dialogs are in play. In order to do it, we had to add some namespaces to page plugin event bindings, but really every plugin should be doing that anyhow ya? - scottjehl
[11:17:19] <johnbender> toddparker: let me know when you're around
[11:17:25] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[11:17:54] <Wilto> About to duck out; I’ll be back in twenty. Not sure what time Todd’s gonna be free.
[11:17:59] <johnbender> kk
[12:53:47] <Wilto> That was a long twenty minutes, but we’re both here.
[13:39:51] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto if either of you guys talk with scottjehl, I could use his eyes on this https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3938
[13:39:52] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3938 on jquery-mobile (johnbender; 4d, 1h ago): ui-fixed-hidden not removed on no-op navigation
[13:46:20] <toddparker> hi johnbender
[13:46:30] <toddparker> mind shooting scott an email or BS message?
[13:47:09] <Wilto> I just posted it in Campfire, too.
[13:47:21] <Wilto> But if it’s pressing, yeah, best to shoot him an email.
[13:58:37] <toddparker> johnbender: ping
[14:12:19] <johnbender> toddparker: pong
[14:13:14] <johnbender> toddparker: I have :( https://filamentgroup.basecamphq.com/projects/8580955-jquery-mobile-team/posts/60502314/comments
[14:13:40] <johnbender> toddparker: Wilto: also where is the repo with the browser issues we fix?
[14:18:38] <toddparker> we fix or we find?
[14:18:58] <toddparker> been tracking bugs here: https://github.com/scottjehl/Device-Bugs/issues
[14:19:41] <toddparker> johnbender: can you give this a quick look? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3949
[14:19:41] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3949 on jquery-mobile (dbeuning; 1d, 2h ago): taptoggle feature, turns headers into footers
[14:19:49] <toddparker> seems bizarro
[14:24:32] <johnbender> toddparker: that and the issues I was asking scott about are at least somewhat related
[14:27:16] <toddparker> gotcha. hopefully, he can give that a look tonight. At this point, there are just a few fixed toolbar things I want him to review
[14:27:38] <johnbender> toddparker: ooh, can you add one more thing to his stack?
[14:27:42] <johnbender> toolbar
[14:27:47] <toddparker> i don't think there are any blockers for rc2 now
[14:28:04] <toddparker> i did some cleanup over the weekend visually and on the docs
[14:28:09] <toddparker> working on a blog post
[14:28:24] <johnbender> toddparker: in the show and hide methods there's a gigantic chunk of boolean logic
[14:28:25] <toddparker> thanks for going thru those pulls
[14:28:35] <toddparker> for fixed?
[14:28:37] <johnbender> yah
[14:28:48] <johnbender> toddparker: it's identical and impossible to read / modify
[14:28:53] <johnbender> we need to put that in it's own method
[14:29:15] <johnbender> toddparker: more important though is that issue
[14:29:16] <toddparker> might be good to comment on that
[14:29:20] <johnbender> it breaks fixed header and footer
[14:29:28] <johnbender> toddparker: alright I'll attach it to the basecamp post
[14:29:38] <toddparker> maybe follow up on that BC message with these other thing
[14:29:41] <toddparker> yah :)
[14:30:31] <toddparker> bender - would you ever want to go to orlando for BB Jam in May
[14:30:50] <johnbender> toddparker: "BB jam" ?
[14:31:34] <toddparker> blackberry
[14:31:49] <johnbender> toddparker: with oscon, railsconf, throne, and jquerconfsf I'm well over my wife's limit with my absences :(
[14:31:53] <toddparker> conference, not a condiment
[14:32:08] <toddparker> understand that for sure
[14:32:09] <johnbender> did they want a rep there from the team?
[14:32:15] <toddparker> my son is having a surgery then
[14:32:17] <toddparker> ya
[14:32:25] <toddparker> problem is we're such a small team
[14:32:40] <toddparker> gseguin: sunny florida?
[14:33:06] <toddparker> guessing kinblas is swamped
[14:36:38] <johnbender> toddparker: also I would say the issue I linked earlier is a blocker
[14:46:25] <toddparker> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3938
[14:46:26] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3938 on jquery-mobile (johnbender; 4d, 2h ago): ui-fixed-hidden not removed on no-op navigation
[14:48:32] <johnbender> toddparker: yah that one
[14:48:48] <johnbender> I didn't mark it as such but if we're going out with another rc I would think that's important
[16:01:13] <johnbender> toddparker: one issue I'm running into here in dealing with the pull requests is creating a new branch for each as we sort out the release candidate
[16:06:23] <johnbender> toddparker: I since we're starting to move on to working on things that will most likely go into 1.2 it would be nice to cut our 1.1 branch so we can work directly on master
[16:07:01] <johnbender> I guess there's just some pain threshold where creating/managing a bunch of new branches exceeds the pain of porting bug fixes
