[02:23:50] <mazzachre> Where to post problems and bug reports?
[02:46:40] <mazzachre> Why does dialogs not work? When I click the "close" button I don't get to the page I was on, but the page prior to that (so going back 2 instead of 1)
[05:17:32] <mazzachre> Is jquerymobile actually dead? Or is it being developed?
[07:51:51] <mazzachre> Anyone alive?
