[04:16:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] the ui-mobile-rendering class should handle page visibility during init just fine, which means hiding .ui-page by its class is all we need. This is the first step towards addressing issue #3648 - scottjehl

[07:41:22] <toddmparker_> Wilto is rolling that back now, then will test like crazy

[08:34:50] <johnbender> toddmparker_: Wilto: gseguin: I'm ready to cut the 1.1-stable
[08:34:56] <johnbender> any objections
[08:35:16] <johnbender> this only really means that any bug fixes that should go in the release will have to be done to both from here on out
[08:35:22] <johnbender> both master and 1.1-stable that is
[08:36:37] <toddmparker_> johnbender: is this backwards from how we did 1.0?
[08:36:53] <toddmparker_> isn't master always the next version and we have branches for releases?
[08:37:31] <toddmparker_> actually in this case, do we need a branch at all for the rc?
[08:37:36] <toddmparker_> we never did for 1.0
[08:37:58] <johnbender> toddmparker_: we never did for 1.0 because master was the release
[08:38:09] <johnbender> we need to cut a branch for patch releases
[08:38:12] <toddmparker_> isn't that the case here too?
[08:38:19] <toddmparker_> yeah, right
[08:38:37] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yes master will be but "after" the release we'll need a branch
[08:38:48] <johnbender> I just need to cut the branch so that I can set up a build
[08:38:56] <johnbender> it doesn't matter whether it happens after or before the release
[08:39:58] <toddmparker_> ok...
[08:40:28] <toddmparker_> just so i understand tho, we're going to be tagging rc1 from master then rc2 or final or whatever - all from master
[08:40:46] <toddmparker_> we don't need to worry about maintenance until we hit 1.1 final, right?
[08:40:55] <toddmparker_> so this is strictly for the build?
[08:42:44] <johnbender> toddmparker_: do you just want to point people at /latest/ for the rc docs?
[08:42:47] <johnbender> err
[08:42:49] <johnbender> /test/
[08:42:59] <johnbender> then I don't have to set up a build at all
[08:43:30] <toddmparker_> well, no I'd like to have a fixed RC for posterity
[08:43:47] <toddmparker_> when we were doing the 1.0 releases, we didn't make branches for the builds
[08:43:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: sorry
[08:43:51] <johnbender> I'm being confusing
[08:43:54] <johnbender> there are two builds
[08:44:06] <johnbender> one that creates the minified js/css
[08:44:12] <johnbender> and another one that creates the docs
[08:44:25] <toddmparker_> ok
[08:44:30] <johnbender> the minified js one will be rc specific
[08:44:49] <toddmparker_> and the docs?
[08:44:57] <johnbender> so there will be new file for each rc, and the docs at /demos/ will be the rc docs
[08:45:08] <johnbender> I'm basically just doing a deploy with the rc
[08:45:21] <toddmparker_> right
[08:45:33] <johnbender> the docs at /test/ are the latest from master, or in other words, the RC
[08:45:58] <johnbender> I may have answered my own question there
[08:46:10] <johnbender> I guess if we do a deploy and the docs at /demos/ are for the RC then it doesn't really matter
[08:46:20] <toddmparker_> well, they are until we make a commit after RC1
[08:46:25] <toddmparker_> then things get fuzzy
[08:46:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: right but we can point people at /test/ then
[08:47:37] <toddmparker_> maybe hte build proces is different now, but when we did the betas and RCs for 1.0 John Resign just ran the builds and pushed everything up but we never had to add branches
[08:47:44] <johnbender> I guess I was thinking we'd want to preserve the existing docs, for 1.0.1, until we do an actual release
[08:47:59] <johnbender> toddmparker_: right but we have an existing release
[08:48:02] <johnbender> were as before we didn't
[08:48:09] <johnbender> actually
[08:48:14] <toddmparker_> is this just abut /demos/
[08:48:25] <toddmparker_> because we have a hard link to 1.0.1
[08:48:28] <johnbender> yes
[08:48:41] <johnbender> and I think we should preserve those docs until we stop supporting that release
[08:48:47] <johnbender> even if we move them
[08:49:03] <toddmparker_> so now that we have a stable and unstable build, I wonder if /demos/ shoudl always point to stable (1.0.1 in this case)
[08:49:10] <johnbender> /1.0.1-demos/ or something
[08:49:15] <toddmparker_> I guess I just thought that was a redirect
[08:49:18] <johnbender> but I'll leave that up to you
[08:49:23] <johnbender> that's why I'm asking about the branch
[08:49:28] <johnbender> I thought we would do the reverse
[08:49:34] <johnbender> /demos/ would stay 1.0.1 until we did a release
[08:49:46] <toddmparker_> but we already have that
[08:50:45] <toddmparker_> demos
[08:50:52] <toddmparker_> just redirects to http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0.1/
[08:51:11] <toddmparker_> and i might want to keep it that way until 1.1 is stable
[08:51:36] <toddmparker_> so aren't you just pushing up to http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0rc1/
[08:53:00] <toddmparker_> each release should have a URL like that
[08:57:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: let me check on that redirect
[08:57:29] <toddmparker_> cool
[08:57:36] <toddmparker_> i see demos as a simple redirect
[08:57:45] <toddmparker_> if we have to manually edit it between major releases, fine
[08:58:05] <toddmparker_> but otehrwisde, the docs and CDN js/css always go up to a standard fixed URL
[08:58:25] <toddmparker_> and we add a branch only when we hit a stable release
[08:58:46] <toddmparker_> think that's the general idea
[08:59:07] <toddmparker_> you saw all the links to the js and css in my blog post, right? wanted to confirm naming
[08:59:47] <johnbender> toddmparker_: it is a redirect, so just to be clear you want the /demos/ to redirec to the 1.1.0-rc.1 right?
[09:00:42] <toddmparker_> coo
[09:00:43] <toddmparker_> cool
[09:01:09] <toddmparker_> i think that the rule should be that demos points to latest stable (1.0.1)
[09:01:12] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I would add something to the blog post about the current release docs being at /demos/1.0.1/ too if you didn't already
[09:01:22] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright then we have to fix that redirect
[09:01:25] <toddmparker_> until we release 1.1.0, then it will change to that
[09:01:28] <toddmparker_> right
[09:01:41] <toddmparker_> i may add a link to both on the homepage. think UI does that
[09:01:53] <johnbender> ok
[09:02:14] <johnbender> changing that redirect might take me a bit
[09:02:53] <johnbender> the logic right now is that it just prefers the folder that was added last
[09:03:31] <johnbender> I guess it can just prefer the latest folde without beta/alpha/rc in the folder name
[09:11:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright I'll get to work on that once I get into the office
[09:11:56] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I did check the links when I read through the blog post and I think they were fine but I'll know for sure when I deploy to the cdn
[09:12:03] <johnbender> which we can do before the post goes out
[09:19:24] <toddmparker_> cool, thanks!
[09:19:37] <toddmparker_> Wilto and maggie are testing like crazy now
[09:21:16] <johnbender> sweet
[09:21:23] <johnbender> toddmparker_: stoked to do this release
[09:21:29] <johnbender> it's such an awesome step forward
[09:21:34] <johnbender> ok

[09:21:42] <toddmparker_> ok, talk to you in a bit
[09:41:25] <gseguin> Good morning
[09:42:24] <gseguin> Did you guys look into: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3645 ?
[09:42:25] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3645 on jquery-mobile, reported by frequent (1d, 7h ago): using on()/off() and #pageIDs with JQM1.unstable and jquery 1.7+
[09:42:51] <gseguin> that seems like it could be a blocker for 1.1
[09:42:57] <gseguin> johnbender: ^
[10:13:52] <toddmparker_> let's see what johnbender thinks
[10:13:55] <toddmparker_> thanks gseguin
[10:14:37] <toddmparker_> oh, gseguin - i was just chatting with tyler and apparently themeroller keys off this comment for parsing

[10:31:05] <gseguin> toddmparker_: should I revert that commit?
[10:35:53] <tbenzige> gseguin: yeah. the commit only changed one comment
[10:36:05] <tbenzige> and that comment turned out to be very important for ThemeRoller's parsing

[11:17:35] <toddmparker_> cool

[12:54:20] <toddmparker_> no, we're still testing
[12:54:33] <toddmparker_> doing a full pass with mat and maggie
[12:54:48] <toddmparker_> been enough broken things int eh last few days, I'm a bit nervus
[12:54:57] <toddmparker_> and kan't spel
[12:56:36] <johnbender> toddmparker_: alright, I'm going to grab some lunch
[12:56:47] <toddmparker_> sounds good johnbender
[12:56:52] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I made the change to the demos redirect to ignore release candidates
[12:57:00] <johnbender> so they can be linked directly
[12:57:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: OH!
[12:57:07] <johnbender>  and one more thing, about the blog post
[12:57:40] <johnbender> we should probably mention $.mobile.ignoreContentEnabled in the two snippets about data-enhance=false and data-ajax=false
[12:58:06] <toddmparker_> cool
[12:58:27] <toddmparker_> do you have edit access to WP?
[13:21:00] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Ping!
[13:21:17] <gseguin> hey _|Nix|_
[13:21:21] <gseguin> what's up?
[13:21:52] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I made the multi-popup thing work in several ways, and I need to decide which one to PR.
[13:22:43] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: 1. Set #&ui-state=dialog for the first popup, and then remember all subsequent popups. When the user clicks "Back", or the last popup is closed, you go back to before #&ui-state=dialog.
[13:23:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: 2. Set #jqmNPopups=n for each popup, and when the user clicks back, for each popup you go back one history entry.
[13:24:19] <gseguin> I like #2
[13:24:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Currently I have both implemented and switched on a variable $.mobile.popupsHaveOneHistoryEntry = (true|false)
[13:25:37] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Another thing is that I noticed that jqm has this thing called urlHistory which seems to be doing a job very similar to the stack that keeps track of the popups currently open.
[13:25:47] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: However, I'm not quite sure how to use that.
[13:25:57] <gseguin> I think that is worth starting a discussion via an issue on Github so other people can weigh in
[13:26:06] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: OK.
[13:26:11] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: ... or a PR.
[13:26:23] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Put the code up for ppl to look at.
[13:26:23] <gseguin> yeah absolutely, PR works too
[13:26:31] <_|Nix|_> OK.
[13:28:14] <gseguin> urlHistory is jQM's history handling because we support changePage with no hashchange
[13:28:34] <gseguin> that allows us to keep track of "real" history
[13:31:31] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: Aha, well, I guess that doesn't apply in this case, because in this case I /want/ a hash change so as to allow the user to close popups using the back button.
[13:31:57] <gseguin> yep
[13:50:17] <Wilto> Alright just finished testing all the things on all the things, and I have no qualms about 1.1rc1.

[13:52:15] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: it looks like you did the PR against master, is that intentional?
[13:52:24] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: No! D'oh!
[13:52:55] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: F0rk! Can't change it now, eh?
[13:53:29] <gseguin> you can cherry pick the changes into the popup branch
[13:53:38] <gseguin> and then reset your master branch
[13:53:48] <Wilto> I think we gotta demote BlackBerry 6 and below to static “fixed” toolbars.
[13:54:10] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I probably do, I'll take a look
[13:54:18] <gseguin> Wilto: because of the orientation change problem?
[13:54:33] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I'll just close the PR and create a correct one.
[13:54:42] <Wilto> gseguin: Just generally looking busted.
[13:54:45] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: sounds good
[13:54:53] <gseguin> Wilto: oh ok
[13:54:53] <Wilto> BB7 is more or less okay; some little rendering issues here and there.
[13:55:02] <Wilto> 6 has them jumping all over the place.

[13:57:05] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by gabrielschulhof (1m, 16s ago): Popup stack management
[14:00:16] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: I was thinking that this kind of management-via-hash-change can be made to work uniformly across both popups and dialogs, but that means that the stuff after the hashmark will acquire a certain structure (like #jqmNPopups=5&jqmNDialogs=3) or something like that ...
[14:01:30] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: I agree, that's why I want to involve kinblas and other folks into that discussion
[14:01:37] <gseguin> I have to run to a meeting
[14:01:46] <_|Nix|_> gseguin: K L8R
[14:01:48] <gseguin> I will look at that PR later this week
[14:01:51] <gseguin> thank you _|Nix|_
[14:01:59] <_|Nix|_> NP.
[14:02:19] <_|Nix|_> I also noticed that #&ui-state=dialog has some special significance, because I tried #&something=somethingElse, and I got a jquery error (probably from one of the hash change handlers).
[14:10:45] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: wrt to your PR "Popup stack management" we have dialogs opened from dialogs return to the parent dialog on close
[14:11:11] <johnbender> that's will only be important when/if we use popups as a replacement for dialogs
[14:12:06] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah, I figured there was already something like this.
[14:12:22] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: cool cool
[14:12:32] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... but can you return to the parent dialog by clicking "Back"?
[14:13:38] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: The original reason for doing any hash manipulation at all was that, apparently on BB it's important to be able to close a popup by hitting "Back", rather than tapping the screen outside of the popup's area.
[14:14:04] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: yah, we maintain a history stack parallel with the browsers for those cases
[14:14:11] <johnbender> going back in general requires that we do
[14:14:24] <johnbender> because we can't know where we came from we just have to make some assumptions
[14:14:46] <johnbender> actually there's a really bad outstanding bug that no one ever runs into with our "where are we" back button logic
[14:15:13] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Got a number? Just curious ...
[14:15:41] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I don't but it's actually really easy to solve
[14:15:46] <johnbender> you can see the issue in the docs pretty easily
[14:16:33] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: let me try and find one, and if I can't I'll open one myselkf

[14:45:09] <Wilto> ( w.blackberry && ( w.navigator.appVersion.match( /Version\/([0-9])/ ) && parseInt( RegExp.$1, 10 ) < 7 ) )
[14:45:25] <Wilto> have mercy on my soul
[14:48:01] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: This seems like a far more subtle issue than anything in the popup stack. That stuff is fairly straight-forward.
[14:48:13] <johnbender> right
[14:48:35] <johnbender> aside from the usability choice we made in going back to a dialog from a dialog
[14:48:43] <johnbender> that's the other ugly one we have to address
[14:48:51] <johnbender> not at all related to the dialogs or popups though
[14:49:02] <johnbender> I thought you might be interested :D
[14:51:02] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, having too many dialogs and/or popups on the screen is bad UI design, anyway ...
[14:51:23] <toddmparker_> hey
[14:51:29] <johnbender> toddmparker_: heyo
[14:51:38] <toddmparker_> johnbender: mat and maggie just finished testing
[14:51:50] <toddmparker_> nothing major cropped up
[14:52:02] <johnbender> toddmparker_: cool, I'll go ahead and tag it/release it
[14:52:13] <toddmparker_> Wilto is excluding BB5-6 from fixed toolbars because the native implementation is so bad
[14:52:17] <johnbender> and then make sure everything is in place
[14:52:21] <toddmparker_> but things seem solid
[14:52:25] <Wilto> Just gross as hell, yeah.
[14:52:36] <toddmparker_> i think we should plan on pushing this out when you get in tomorrow
[14:52:40] <johnbender> toddmparker_: the way were deploying this means there's no public facing change
[14:52:53] <toddmparker_> releasing late in the day isn't too awesome
[14:52:55] <Wilto> BB7 may yet be demoted. It’s flaky-but-usable, but slow as hell to scroll when the fixed stuff is on the page.
[14:53:01] <johnbender> toddmparker_: so give me a couple minutes and I'll let you know when things are in place
[14:53:13] <toddmparker_> so are you saying that you could tag this tonight
[14:53:38] <johnbender> toddmparker_: I can tag it right now if you want and we can push everything out
[14:53:48] <johnbender> the blog post is the only thing that will direct people to it's presense
[14:54:01] <toddmparker_> so i could blog it first thing in the morning and tweet then?
[14:54:04] <johnbender> cdn links and the link to the demos/ subfolder for the docs
[14:54:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: yassir
[14:54:21] <johnbender> toddmparker_: let me get it out there, check it and then send you the links
[14:54:22] <toddmparker_> the ideal is to announce around 8am EST so people read it in the morning
[14:54:26] <toddmparker_> buzz-wise
[14:54:28] <johnbender> yep
[14:54:54] <toddmparker_> so if you want to tag this before heading out so I can test all the links and such int eh blog post, that woudl be great
[14:55:03] * johnbender goes off to do that
[14:55:09] <toddmparker_> I'll announce in the morning
[14:55:12] <toddmparker_> cool
[15:17:01] <Wilto> johnbender: We should have zero (0) instances of require.js in the mix at this point, yeah?
[15:17:13] <johnbender> Wilto: where?
[15:17:20] <Wilto> Anywhere in the docs.
[15:17:22] <johnbender> Wilto: in the tests it should still be there
[15:17:29] <johnbender> Wilto: correct
[15:17:30] <Wilto> I’m seeing some in the tests, too—guessing that’s… yep.

[15:18:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Demoted BlackBerry 6 and below to fixed toolbars’ static fallbacks due to egregious rendering issues. - Mat Marquis
[15:18:14] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Made browser sniff for BlackBerry 6 or lesser a little less gross, if that’s even possible. - Mat Marquis
[15:18:26] <Wilto> I’m not a proud man.

[16:03:13] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] alter version for rc and fix the makefile for deploy - John Bender
[16:23:38] <gseguin> johnbender: rc.1 ?
[16:23:49] <gseguin> I thought it was rc1 (no dot)
[18:06:58] <johnbender> gseguin: semver.org v2
[18:08:10] <johnbender> gseguin: I figured if it didn't hurt anyone and it was compliant we get the version and we'll be sure to operate properly with the jquery package website that scott_gonzalez is building
[18:10:11] <scott_gonzalez> They're both valid. semver.org says you need the dot, node-semver says you don't (because that's how the real world works)
[18:21:04] <johnbender> +1 for standards? :D
