[03:34:40] <uGoMobi> Yippie :)
[07:32:03] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: You still around?
[07:34:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: There is an alternative to add class have to check speed and cross browser compat thought
[08:06:40] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: Ok never mind add class alternative MUCH slower then addClass
[10:18:15] <toddmparker_> I think the panel stuff is sensitive to timing issues. a lot of the android issues felt like it just wasn't bothering to render class changes
[10:19:21] <toddmparker_> we tinkered around until we got it to work but Scott and I ended up thinking that it was fragile and small changes to the code could break things again.
[10:19:38] <toddmparker_> guess we were right :)
[11:02:42] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: Was the issue you saw the panel not showing at all or the blinking and header issue like uGoMobi described?
[11:29:10] <toddmparker_> arschmitz: i'm at home so i only have browserstack to test
[11:29:37] <toddmparker_> but i was seeing odd stuff there - overlay left would open a blank column on the *right* of the page, etc.
[11:30:05] <toddmparker_> ^^ and there was no panel there, but blank space
[11:30:21] <toddmparker_> but i can never know how accurate browserstack is
[11:33:02] <toddmparker_> just re-tested on bs with nexus 7 (4.1) and on all types you don't see a panel now
[11:33:39] <toddmparker_> odd it's so messed up. it was 100% fine when we were hacking css ~2 weeks ago
[11:34:11] <toddmparker_> thought we mostly did unit tests and stuff like like more recently but it must be somethign that looks small that is messing everything up
[11:34:30] <toddmparker_> do you have a 4.x device to test on? just curious what you're seeing
[11:45:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: i dont have a real device either im only on browser stack also
[11:46:13] <arschmitz> but uGoMobi: is seeing the same thing now that i saw on real device when i tested earlier this week
[11:47:20] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: on browser stack im seeing exactly the same as you. 
[11:48:18] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: so what im thinking is it is a timing issue. browserstack is slower then a real device for sure. webviews generally run much slower then regular browser also iv seen tests showing them up to 50% slower
[11:49:22] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: so to me it makes sense that browserstack would show the same as a webview if it is a timing issue.
[11:52:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker_:uGoMobi: was indicating a timing issue on firefox also so to me it looks like all signs point that direction
[11:54:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: tomorrow im going to roll back to when it worked on my server and test on browser stack to confirm if this was always an issue on browser stack 
[12:12:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: not sure if this is good new or not lol but i realized i could do^^ just as easy from here so i did
[12:13:35] <arschmitz> this is not a regression its browser stack i rolled back to when i know it was working for sure on real devices and before any recent changes (about 2 weeks like you said) 12-20-12 and on browserstack its the same as it is on latest
[12:30:48] <agcolom> toddmparker_: I'm back in London! Are you looking for someone to test something on an Android device?
[12:31:44] <arschmitz> agcolom: do you have a 4.0 or 4.1 android on hand?
[12:32:13] <agcolom> arschmitz: I have my partner's Nexus something... Not sure how to find out what version this is ... 
[12:32:36] <agcolom> I think it's called a Nexus 7?
[12:32:43] <arschmitz> perfect
[12:32:58] <agcolom> which URL should I use?
[12:33:10] <arschmitz> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/panels/index.html
[12:33:25] <arschmitz> just need to know if the panels open basicly
[12:33:35] <agcolom> ok... 
[12:33:44] <agcolom> I'll use chrome...
[12:33:50] <arschmitz> ok
[12:34:26] <agcolom> overlay: yes
[12:35:13] <agcolom> ok, they all work fine
[12:35:22] <agcolom> arschmitz: toddmparker ^
[12:35:24] <arschmitz> cool
[12:35:40] <agcolom> do you know how I can find out which os version it is?
[12:36:10] <arschmitz> nexus 7 is 4.1
[12:36:20] <agcolom> oh ok :-) Thank :-)
[12:36:22] <arschmitz> but i think its in settings then device or something
[12:36:37] <arschmitz> i dont normally use an android :) only for testing ha ha
[12:37:07] <agcolom> oh yes, it's a 4.1.2
[12:37:17] <arschmitz> agcolom: cool
[12:37:24] <agcolom> (settings -> about tablet)
[12:37:41] <arschmitz> look like browserstack is the issue 
[12:37:50] <agcolom> oh, ok! 
[12:38:10] <arschmitz> they have a nexus 7 on there and it dosent work at all
[12:42:13] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: so i think we can draw one of 2 conclusions here....
[12:43:21] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: 1.) either browserstack behaves more like a webview then a true devices (probably not fixable in this case just have to use the position:fixed option) 
[12:44:18] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: or 2.) thats its a timing issue like i talk about above and is just being exposed by browserstack / webview because they are slower (we should be able to fix this case i think)
[12:57:50] <agcolom> arschmitz: very strange... I managed to get the space for the left panel to get displayed... but I can't anymore (On the Nexus 7 onBrowserstack)
[12:58:58] <arschmitz> agcolom: yeah panels are totally broken on browserstack on android 4.0 and 4.1
[12:59:13] <arschmitz> but work fine on real devices
[12:59:38] <agcolom> well, that's the main thing ;-) but I guess toddmparker must be worried!
[13:32:11] <ryanneufeld> is there a way to interrupt a page load?
[13:33:08] <ryanneufeld> http://jsfiddle.net/TV4Tb/1/ in this example all the pages are in the DOM already
[13:33:48] <ryanneufeld> and when the link for Page2 is clicked it shoudl just load page3 without displaying page 2. Someone in #jquery is attempting this. I'm not sure it's even posisble
[13:47:57] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: I'm on my ipad right now or I'd make a jsbin demo but yesterday
[13:48:02] <arschmitz> Yesterday
[13:48:14] <arschmitz> Ack yes not yesterday's
[13:51:04] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: You can use pagebeforechange to modify the params to redirect like they are trying to do see pagebeforechange on http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/api/events.html
[13:51:18] <ryanneufeld> thanks arschmitz
[13:51:41] <arschmitz> ryanneufeld: No problem
[15:22:05] <Changsuk> Hi, All
[15:23:14] <Changsuk> arschmitz, uGoMobi: I read your reply and thanks for committing that issue - #5404.
[16:28:17] <arschmitz> Changsuk: Not a problem we had to make a few changes to resolve some dependancy issues but its a really good idea much much faster
[16:30:33] <arschmitz> Changsuk: _|Nix|_: and i have been discussing the other idea you mentioned in your email about injecting elements. and discussing the best way to do this but it is much faster and a good idea
[16:46:31] <Changsuk> arschmitz, _|Nix|_: Yes, right. Using a JS API to access DOM contents is much fater than "$( "<XXX>" )" API.
[16:47:30] <arschmitz> Changsuk: the one problem is code weight it adds a minimum of 2 lines per use generally at least 3 or 4 
[16:47:40] <Changsuk> But, I think that that case may not meet jQuery standards so I'm dithering to do a PR.
[16:48:03] <arschmitz> Changsuk: there is no problem with standards we already do it that way in a bunch of places
[16:48:13] <Changsuk> arschmitz: Really?
[16:48:22] <Changsuk> arschmitz: Hew~~~ ;)
[16:48:42] <arschmitz> Changsuk: so one thing we are looking at doing is adding a makeDOM function which will construct them 
[16:49:43] <arschmitz> Changsuk: i have such a function iv been testing and right now it some how (and i cant explain how) is actually faster then doing it the way you mentioned each time 
[16:49:44] <Changsuk> arschmitz: Ah ha, I see.
[16:50:00] <arschmitz> Changsuk: and it dosent add any code weight
[16:51:00] <arschmitz> Changsuk: http://jsperf.com/makedom-reverse
[16:51:04] <Changsuk> then, I don't need to do a PR?
[16:51:37] <arschmitz> Changsuk: i would hold off for now until we can discuss more and decide the best implementation we will keep you updated
[16:51:40] <Changsuk> That's good test ~!!
[16:51:57] <arschmitz> once we do we would love the help and going through and implementing it though
[16:53:07] <arschmitz> Changsuk: Yes i was very pleased with the test and will be pretty easy to use just pass in a JSON object and it will create it 
[16:54:20] <arschmitz> in the actual version it would pass back the object so you could append or prepend or whatever you want
[16:56:55] <Changsuk> arschmitz: then, I'll wait for you to commit the new access method.
[16:57:21] <arschmitz> Changsuk: we will keep you updated about what we decide
[16:57:56] <Changsuk> arschmitz: Keep update?
[16:58:30] <arschmitz> let you know after we discuss more what we want to do and if we decide to use a function like this
[16:59:06] <Changsuk> arschmitz: Ok, I see.
[16:59:48] <Changsuk> So, will I do more things to discuss that issue?
[17:00:16] <Changsuk> arschmitz: Do a PR? or more talks via emails or IRC?
[17:01:04] <arschmitz> Changsuk: i would holdoff on a PR for now. We will let you know either on here or via IRC
[17:01:12] <Changsuk> arschmitz: I'm sorry that I'm not farmiliar with jQM opensource. please understand me. ;)
[17:01:34] <arschmitz> Changsuk: its fine not a problem at all
[17:02:11] <Changsuk> arschmitz: Ok, I got it. Thanks for your kind responce.
[17:02:58] <arschmitz> Changsuk: we are happy to have the help. your suggestions so far have been really good
[17:03:10] <Changsuk> arschmitz: after you need my support, please feel free to email me.
[17:03:26] <arschmitz> Changesuk: ok thank you very much
[17:03:28] <Changsuk> Your welcome, It's my pleasure~ :)
[17:06:22] <Changsuk> arschmitz: Is there late night? I think that you do a very hard work to keep this channel.
[17:06:44] <arschmitz> Changsuk: its 8:00pm here
[17:07:06] <arschmitz> Changusk: Im normally here untill about midnight
[17:07:09] <Changsuk> arschmitz: ah... ha ha... isn't late.
[17:09:38] <Changsuk> arschmitz: Have a good night and see you later.
[17:09:49] <arschmitz> Changsuk: goodnight
[18:05:56] <toddmparker_> hey arschmitz 
[18:06:07] <toddmparker_> just catching up
[18:06:28] <toddmparker_> so it sounds like real devices are ok but browserstack is off somehow, timing-wise
[18:06:57] <toddmparker_> still don't like that it not 100% on the emulators, going to be confusing for testing
[18:07:28] <toddmparker_> if you disable the fixed positioning, does it look on on BS? I'll try that now
[18:25:10] <arschmitz> hey toddmparker_:
[18:25:40] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yes disableing fixed positioning makes it work on browserstack.
[18:26:20] <toddmparker_> oh hai
[18:26:34] <toddmparker_> updating the panel docs. lots of inaccurate stuff there now
[18:26:42] <toddmparker_> oh, cool
[18:26:52] <toddmparker_> here's an odd one i just found
[18:26:55] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah a few new options and stuff too
[18:27:21] <toddmparker_> if i open a reveal or push panel and use the Esc key to close it, the header blinks and looks wonky
[18:27:37] <toddmparker_> but if i click out to close, it's fine. maybe another timing thing?
[18:27:46] <arschmitz> toddmparker: could be
[18:27:59] <toddmparker_> yeah, i'm coming thu the js for the docs
[18:28:00] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: not sure if you saw the ios6 comments 
[18:28:15] <toddmparker_> i saw that fly by
[18:28:33] <arschmitz> but i can reproduce these but i think its because of the css zachleat removed i think putting it backwill fix all of those
[18:28:40] <toddmparker_> i'm on 6.0.2 on my iphone 5
[18:28:52] <toddmparker_> what was the issue?
[18:29:02] <arschmitz> you can scroll horizontal
[18:29:07] <arschmitz> swipe to close dosent work
[18:30:08] <arschmitz> and the panel repositions on touchend and dosent actually show fixed positioning
[18:30:46] <arschmitz> the last one im not real sure about but the first too im pretty sure will be fixed by adding overflow-x:hidden back in
[18:31:03] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: just havent had a chance to test yet
[18:31:06] <toddmparker_> right, that is the overflow-x change
[18:31:33] <toddmparker_> maybe we can play with that
[18:31:42] <toddmparker_> it was messing up ff
[18:32:02] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: yeah uGoMobi:  seems to think firefox is a timing issue 
[18:32:29] <arschmitz> so i think maybe we need to take another look at the timing logic to see if we can sure it up somehow
[18:32:36] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/676d192d1f9ccf87e120a1d307b6cfea8b37a7f5
[18:32:42] <toddmparker_> yeah, agreed
[18:33:57] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: if we can i think it very well may fix the android and the firfox issues both
[18:34:28] <toddmparker_> i just dropped this into my local css
[18:34:45] <toddmparker_> and panels seem to work ok in my ff
[18:35:27] <toddmparker_> but according to that, seems like an event wasn't firing...maybe it was messing up tests only?
[18:37:49] <toddmparker_> http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/css-transitions
[18:37:53] <toddmparker_> ^^ very good read
[18:38:56] <arschmitz> cool ill check that out
[18:38:57] <toddmparker_> Transition callback
[18:38:57] <toddmparker_> The next step to chaining transitions is having transition end callbacks. You can achieve this in Webkit, by listening to the webkitTransitionEnd event. For other browsers, you’ll need to do a bit of sniffing to find the right event name.
[18:39:18] <toddmparker_> which links to this gist:
[18:39:19] <toddmparker_> https://gist.github.com/4414792
[18:40:12] <arschmitz> panels already listen for all those
[18:40:21] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/panel.js#L284
[18:41:05] <toddmparker_> aw, snap
[18:41:48] <toddmparker_> is there a difference at all between what we're doing and that gist?
[18:41:56] <arschmitz> let me look
[18:42:25] <toddmparker_> k
[18:42:26] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: a little
[18:42:47] <toddmparker_> do we just need a fallback if it doesn't fire?
[18:43:06] <arschmitz> we just listen for all of them and call complete when it arrives instead of looking for the correct one
[18:43:13] <arschmitz> which should not make a difference
[18:43:29] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: im wondering if we need to use a deffered
[18:43:29] <toddmparker_> right
[18:43:58] <arschmitz> to make sure the first part of the transition is complete before calling complete
[18:44:03] <toddmparker_> we used those quite a bit in the first draft, then re-factored 'em all out :)
[18:44:11] <toddmparker_> worth a shot
[18:44:34] <arschmitz> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/panel.js#L231 i think the stuff after this is not completeing before complete is fired
[18:45:21] <arschmitz> we might need to just make sure this is complete AND the transition is complete before calling complete
[18:45:35] <toddmparker_> makes sense
[18:46:41] <arschmitz> i need to talk to uGoMobi: tomorrow but i think that would fix what he was describing for firefox
[18:48:20] <toddmparker_> cool
[18:48:25] <toddmparker_> back to docs then!
[18:49:07] <arschmitz> yeah we are getting really close to 1.3 beta :) its exciting 
[18:52:05] <toddmparker_> yep, going to start on the blog post after i fix up the docs
[18:52:24] <toddmparker_> downtown abby for my wife = more jQM time
[18:52:48] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: Nice yeah my wife is watching biggest loser so same thing for me
[18:52:59] <toddmparker_> heh
[18:54:15] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: im going to try throwing in a deffered either tonight or tomorrow to see if it fixes anything
[19:22:28] <toddmparker_> ok, cool

[20:36:05] <toddmparker_> I just added a summary of what I just just added and a few issues I ran into that we need to chase down: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5163#issuecomment-11909191
[20:38:43] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: just finished reading for right now at least unless we find a simple solution i think your right about default for position fixed being false
[20:39:07] <toddmparker_> yeah
[20:39:28] <toddmparker_> just testing a hunch and something is up with the responsive rules
[20:39:45] <toddmparker_> if i remove that, some wonkiness goes away
[20:40:16] <arschmitz> yeah the css for these is pretty complex because of interacting with the page
[20:40:49] <toddmparker_> take that back, it's not that
[20:41:10] <toddmparker_> yeah, these turned out to be very tricky
[20:41:31] <arschmitz> im not shocked though that there may be some css bugs about the panels really have a lot going on
[20:42:10] <toddmparker_> yeah. we tried to simplify quite a lot but it's still fiddly
[20:42:49] <arschmitz> toddmparker_: so far from what iv seen though im pretty confident we should be able to get all the issues worked out
[20:42:59] <arschmitz> overall i think they work really well i like them a lot
[20:43:23] <arschmitz> i already have them for an inventory search filter on a project and they are working out great
[20:43:47] <toddmparker_> cool
[20:44:00] <arschmitz> thats how i found all the bugs i fixed last week
[20:44:09] <toddmparker_> using overlay and avoiding fixed toolbar and panels will reduce headaches
[20:44:12] <toddmparker_> heh
[20:44:24] <arschmitz> yeah im using overlay customized a bit
[20:44:28] <toddmparker_> that's why i wanted to make a few more pages tonight
[20:44:31] <toddmparker_> cool
[20:44:40] <arschmitz> i have it go under the header 
[20:44:54] <toddmparker_> just nudged down?
[20:44:58] <arschmitz> yup
[20:45:34] <arschmitz> also actually have it reflow the page content by hooking into page open and close too so its kinda a hybrid mode lol
[20:45:46] <arschmitz> but its what worked best for the specific use case
[20:45:50] <toddmparker_> interesting
[20:45:55] <toddmparker_> might be a cool demo
[20:46:05] <arschmitz> i wanted it to not effect the header and just push page content
[20:46:20] <arschmitz> yeah
[20:46:43] <arschmitz> if i can figure out whats wrong with the server its on ill send you a link to check it out tomorrow 
[20:47:00] <toddmparker_> k
[20:47:14] <toddmparker_> ok, i'm heading to bed. talk to you tomorrow
[20:47:22] <arschmitz> see you tomorrow goodnight
