[04:20:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] scottjehl created css-fixed (+3 new commits): http://git.io/ZOxxHA
[04:20:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/css-fixed] removed fixHeaderFooter files - scottjehl
[04:20:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/css-fixed] removed disablezoom function from init - scottjehl
[04:20:36] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/css-fixed] added new script and associated styles for handling "fixed" toolbars using native support for CSS position: fixed, where possible. Non-supporting platforms will fall back to inline positioning, either by gracefully degrading on their own or by opting them out through a blacklist (fixed positioning detection's got issues...). - scottjehl
[07:26:17] <Wilto> Hell yeah, fixed toolbar branch.
[08:29:47] <fcheslack> finally figured out why I always thought data-role="dialog" was valid: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0/docs/api/methods.html changePage says role falls back on the data-role on the element
[08:53:10] <johnbender> toddparker: in retrospect it's probably best if you take the doc change pull requests
[08:53:17] <johnbender> we're back at 23
[08:54:25] <johnbender> I'm getting the feeling that I'm playing the roll of sisyphus with the pull requests
[08:54:32] <johnbender> only I never got to be king :/
[09:22:49] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^^
[09:23:08] <johnbender> toddmparker_: kinblas: I'm going to set up a build for the stable branch today
[10:57:30] <johnbender> stepping out to get my CA drivers license
[10:57:33] <johnbender> should be back shortly
[10:58:14] <Wilto> Grab me one too.
[11:35:15] <toddmparker_> hey kids!
[11:36:26] <toddmparker_> johnbender - I can review and pull those into master. Do you mind pushing these into the stable branch for me?
[11:37:15] <toddmparker_> kinblas: is this another redirect issue we can't guess? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/3287
[11:37:15] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3287 on jquery-mobile, reported by pehrlich (12h, 8m ago): redirect not cleaning hash state
[11:44:16] <erichynds> Does anyone know if ("ontouchend" in document) will false positive in any version of webkit?
[11:44:31] <erichynds> i noticed that jq mobile uses it, but modernizr doesn't implement that detection at all?

[11:54:44] <toddmparker_> hi erichynds - that would be a good Q for kinblas
[11:57:22] <erichynds> thanks todd. do you know, kinblas?
[12:09:08] <Wilto> I don’t think it does, erichynds.
[12:09:15] <Wilto> Don’t quote me, though.
[12:09:39] <erichynds> sorry, you don't think it reports a false positive on webkit?
[12:13:33] <Wilto> Oh, looks like there was a false positive in Chrome… http://modernizr.github.com/Modernizr/touch.html
[12:15:46] <erichynds> yeah, that's been fixed for some time.. but I wonder if that was chrome or webkit?
[12:16:01] <erichynds> like, I wonder if any device is running a version of webkit that reports that false positive.

[12:32:08] <Wilto> Scott and kinblas would know better than I would, but I can’t recall seeing one.
[12:34:58] <erichynds> i mean, I'm sure ya'll would have noticed if touch events didn't work during the past 1+ year of testing
[12:35:43] <Wilto> Hey, I’m the new guy, remember.
[12:36:52] <erichynds> NOOB
