[07:35:24] <Wilto> DAMMIT, GSEGUIN
[07:52:46] <gseguin> I know, right!?
[07:53:03] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: the PR I landed broke the tests
[07:53:29] <gseguin> _|Nix|_: the navigation tests
[07:54:10] <gseguin> If you have time to look at it I'll leave it like that, otherwise I'll revert it until it's fixed

[09:32:17] <johnbender> gseguin: also, did _|Nix|_'s fix get cherry picked?
[09:34:12] <gseguin> johnbender: it wasn't a fix
[09:34:18] <gseguin> it was just a unit test

[09:56:59] <gseguin> johnbender: do you mind if I edit you comment?
[09:57:47] <gseguin> it's missing the $ in the callback function of the require( [ "jquery" ]
[10:00:08] <johnbender> gseguin: feel free to post a comment with a correction, doesn't bother me :D
[10:00:17] <gseguin> ok
[10:23:59] <johnbender> gseguin: will $.one() default to the window?
[10:29:27] <gseguin> johnbender: what?
[10:32:27] <johnbender> gseguin: in your sample your mobile init binding is $.one( "mobileinit", function(){ });
[10:32:46] <gseguin> oh... oops

[10:47:28] <gseguin> yay! thanks johnbender!
[10:52:26] <johnbender> np np
[10:52:32] <johnbender> it was just the timeout
[10:52:40] <johnbender> though I would like to know why that was required in the first place
[10:54:54] <johnbender> gseguin: I commented on the commit
[10:55:42] <gseguin> yup saw that. thanks

[12:32:54] * _|Nix|_ is catching up ...
[12:35:43] <_|Nix|_> Sorry about the unit test ... the timeout was necessary because, after clicking "Close" on the dialog, it was still visible for a while.
[12:35:56] <_|Nix|_> So, I had to wait a while before checking its visibility ...

[12:38:29] <_|Nix|_> Aaah, I guess I should've placed the start() inside the setTimeout callback ...

[13:14:21] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: never feel bad about breaking the build
[13:14:23] <johnbender> that's what it's there for
[13:14:35] <johnbender> I do a bad job of communicating that when I ask someone to take a look
[13:15:28] <johnbender> when I get back I'm going to look at the one that's broken
[13:15:39] <johnbender> that thing breaks regularly and it's a timeout so that doesn't surprise me
[13:15:58] <johnbender> have to hit the shower real quick
[13:27:25] <_|Nix|_> *sigh* ... I'm kinda torn about this popup stack thing ... I took another look at the code and I realized that I'd kept a lot of cruft in there that made it look complicated - like functions I'd declared because at some point I was calling them from two different places, but not anymore, and so on ... after inlining those, and getting rid of some variables which I was setting but no longer ever checking, the whole popup stack is 50 li
[13:28:21] <_|Nix|_> I'll still try to implement the only-on-popup-allowed, just to see if the navigation code will take less than 50 lines.

[14:11:41] <Wilto> Hey, rule of thumb: should tests go into a commit independent of the thing being tested, or do we care?

[14:51:20] <toddparker> gseguin - did you see that Q on the download builder from a tester
[14:51:27] <toddparker> said the files were really big?
[15:07:28] <_|Nix|_> D0000d! I just realized something: We can do popup stack management with the same code that does mutually exclusive popups - and it turns out that the navigation portion of the mutually exclusive popup code is half the size of the stack management code (50 lines vs. 25 lines).
[15:08:23] <_|Nix|_> In the case of mutually exclusive popups we store the active popup, and then, when a new popup is to be opened, we close the active popup and replace it with the new popup, right?
[15:09:31] <_|Nix|_> Well, what if we don't? The new popup goes on top of the active popup, and replaces $.mobile.activePopup with itself, while storing the old value of $.mobile.activePopup inside an instance variable. Then, when it closes, it puts back the value it stored ... it's a linked list == a stack!
[15:10:16] <_|Nix|_> ... and only the first popup that appears does the nav hookup (which I've now conveniently confined to a single function).
[15:21:23] <_|Nix|_> Whaddy'all think? http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/jqm-mutually-exclusive-popups.avi
