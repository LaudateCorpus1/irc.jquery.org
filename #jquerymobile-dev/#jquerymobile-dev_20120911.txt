[00:43:01] <uGoMobi> good morning
[01:05:45] <uGoMobi>  _|Nix|_ : didn't you agree with todd_  that the links to the advanced popup examples at the bottom of the popup index page can be removed?
[01:26:41] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Yes.
[01:26:52] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Sorry ... I may have forgotten to remove the,.
[01:27:07] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: ok np, just checking before removing them

[01:29:26] <_|Nix|_> Awesome!
[01:29:36] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:19:29] <MauriceG> Morning !
[06:22:25] <MauriceG> ?tell uGoMobi Hi! If you've a moment, here is the revised fiddle for header/content/footer corners in popups with edge cases. Thanks in advance and regards!
[06:22:25] <bot-t> MauriceG, Okay.
[08:49:34] <rpcesar> question, regarding the non-native select controls, is there a way to force behavior one way or another across browsers. on IE I get a full page / dialog with the options, and on chrome I am getting an actual overlay. This dscrepency is causing problems
[08:52:18] <rpcesar> basically, we have a visual builder system, which uses a jqm select to decide which element to place. The problem is I cannot drop the item whilest the page is hidden on IE, as the target drop area reports an outerHeight of 0 (due to its visibility hidden at the time), so as a solution I wait for the pageshow transiton of the parent page to be hit again, and then fire the logic when ready. But because its not a page on chro
[09:17:52] <johnbender> rpcesar: the decision is made on viewport height vs list height
[09:18:01] <johnbender> s/on/based on/
[09:18:29] <rpcesar> is there any way I can coherce the behavior? I saw an open ticket for something like that on github but github went down
[09:18:40] <rpcesar> http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4369
[09:19:04] <johnbender> rpcesar: and the native select won't work for you?
[09:19:08] <rpcesar> essentially, thats what I am looking for. is there any way I can patch this behavior outside of modifying core (as we are using CDN)
[09:19:22] <johnbender> rpcesar: let me take a quick look
[09:19:33] <rpcesar> client demands the L&F of JQM defaults :(
[09:19:40] <johnbender> :/
[09:19:42] <johnbender> bummer
[09:20:38] <johnbender> rpcesar: well there's the ugly way to do it
[09:20:46] <rpcesar> ugly is fine at this point I think
[09:20:47] <johnbender> you could alter the prototype but I'd have to test that
[09:21:01] <rpcesar> what function would I be altering?
[09:21:17] <johnbender> open
[09:21:19] <johnbender> :)
[09:21:26] <johnbender> one sec
[09:21:34] <johnbender> let me see if I can put something together super fast
[09:22:45] <johnbender> rpcesar: I have to verify the timing on something and then I can tell you whether it works or not
[09:25:47] <rpcesar> np, I appreciate your help in the matter. I imagined it could be addressed by the prototype, the problem was finding a spot thats not too overarching, that way I can apply the fix inlined on a page. it does not need to be presented as an option, I just need to override its behavior.
[09:27:07] <johnbender> rpcesar: not with the custom select actually, it does some monkey patching of it's own at runtime :(
[09:28:12] <rpcesar> hmm, is there any means whatsoever to intercept the decision on viewport height vs list height?
[09:29:25] <johnbender> rpcesar: I'm doing it right now
[09:29:28] <johnbender> rpcesar: one sec
[09:29:36] <rpcesar> np, thakns
[09:36:50] <johnbender> rpcesar: ok I've got something working let me just put it in a jsbin for you
[09:38:29] <Wilto> johnbender: No developer certs or anything here.
[09:39:04] <rpcesar> thanks
[09:40:51] <johnbender> rpcesar: http://jsbin.com/utanas/1/edit
[09:41:12] <johnbender> rpcesar: see the !!!! section for where you can alter the behavior
[09:41:20] <johnbender> the way it's set up now it will force a dialog page overlay
[09:42:17] <johnbender> rpcesar: this is super fragile in the face of patches to the library
[09:42:19] <johnbender> so just keep that in mind
[09:42:41] <rpcesar> np. it looks from the likes of that ticket a feature for it is soon to be supported
[09:42:45] <johnbender> but you can always copy out the logic from the open method if there are issues
[09:42:54] <johnbender> rpcesar: yah it's fairly trivial
[09:42:59] <rpcesar> np, thanks for your assistance
[09:43:07] <johnbender> rpcesar: but it won't help you because it won't be out for a while
[09:43:16] <johnbender> best case 1.2.1
[09:43:29] <johnbender> rpcesar: np hopefully it works for you
[09:44:08] <rpcesar> yea, thankfully I can lock down the JQM version for a while, and tweak to fit.
[10:06:51] <adamprocter> Hi just to say I have tested and replied to https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4946  - all working (just my bad code to fix)
[10:08:58] <todd_> hi all
[10:09:13] <todd_> @adamprocter - thanks for testing, this is our last bug to deal with for RC
[10:09:19] <adamprocter> the only other thing I thought I reported was using dialog close button on Android in Phonegap does not close the dialog ? probably me ?
[10:09:25] <todd_> there are a lot of variables in a custom app
[10:09:34] <adamprocter> tell me about it :(
[10:10:22] <todd_> yeah, it's shocking how a bit of CSS that seems innocuous can cause favor. or anything really.
[10:11:12] <todd_> if @johnbender's test page seems to be similar to your situation, but vanilla code, and it works, then it's something on your end
[10:11:57] <adamprocter> at the moment its working with my serverside php files using alpha & 1.7.2 - so ill make a new branch and try and find my bug :D  - sorry for delay in responding was away from desk
[10:13:35] <todd_> no problem, you bug sounded bad enough that we wanted to give it a good look before releasing.
[10:13:38] <todd_> ok to close that?
[10:13:51] <adamprocter> yes please - anyway I'm new here so probably breaking all etiquette - thanks again - logging out
[10:20:37] <johnbender> todd_: cool
[10:24:21] <adamprocter> I found other submission but apologies if its my custom app https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4950
[10:26:47] <johnbender> adamprocter: is that using the jsbin link that I provided or your app
[10:28:24] <johnbender> todd_: I'm having trouble closing that data-rel external dialog too :/
[10:28:32] <johnbender> todd_: in phonegap android
[10:29:00] <johnbender> todd_: going to check outside of jsbin
[10:30:09] <todd_> @adamprocter - no problem.
[10:30:18] <todd_> johnbender: huh, odd
[10:30:32] <todd_> well, that's the last one so keep plugging away
[10:32:51] <johnbender> todd_: sigh, the back button works, going to try a window.history.back link :/
[10:33:01] <todd_> mysterious
[10:38:41] <rpcesar> john, just wanted to thank you again, your monkey patch worked terrifically. now, when it comes to updating this for future reference, for the most part it looks like I just need to copy the chunks inside the conditionals to match the functionality of the jqm version I am overriding?
[10:39:04] <johnbender> rpcesar: you just need to grab the open method from the custom select extension
[10:39:19] <johnbender> it't a bit tangled in there but you should be able to find that
[10:39:27] <johnbender> rpcesar: on sec
[10:39:45] <rpcesar> and then force the conditional to true from within that. correct?
[10:39:59] <johnbender> rpcesar: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/select.custom.js#L329
[10:40:03] <johnbender> correct
[10:40:18] <johnbender> rpcesar: there are two references in there to closed over variables though
[10:40:27] <johnbender> which I changed in the code snippet I gave you
[10:40:35] <johnbender> rpcesar: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/forms/select.custom.js#L364
[10:40:44] <johnbender> that should be changed to self.menuPage
[10:40:57] <johnbender> other than that all you have to do is force that if to be true
[10:41:07] <rpcesar> got it
[10:41:36] <todd_> this might be worth documenting
[10:41:45] <johnbender> todd_: not a good idea :(
[10:41:49] <todd_> heh
[10:41:49] <johnbender> it's sewper ugly
[10:41:58] <todd_> ok, figured
[10:42:00] <johnbender> there's a feature request
[10:42:03] <todd_> ya
[10:42:20] <johnbender> todd_: bad news
[10:42:27] <todd_> johnbender: this code example look solid to you? I'd like to pull this docs change in
[10:42:27] <johnbender> todd_: window.history.back doesn't work :/
[10:42:27] <todd_> https://github.com/MauriceG/jquery-mobile/commit/95a0fa9da8d2c87edc7bfde2a0097b375a711a74
[10:42:30] <todd_> bad news?
[10:42:37] <todd_> huh, really?
[10:42:43] <todd_> in phonegap?
[10:42:50] <johnbender> I'm going to take jqm out and see if that makes a difference but I just added a link with "window.history.back"
[10:42:55] <johnbender> in an onclick attr
[10:42:55] <johnbender> :/
[10:42:57] <johnbender> so we'll see
[10:43:43] <todd_> http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.0.0/phonegap_events_events.md.html#backbutton
[10:43:52] <todd_> onclick FTW
[10:44:18] <johnbender> zomg
[10:44:23] <johnbender> way to break web pages ...
[10:44:47] <johnbender> todd_: well that may be for the hardware back button
[10:45:57] <todd_> For Android v1.0 every page is loaded as a new activity, so there is no history.  To go back, you need to exit the activity - which is what the back button does.  To go back programmatically, instead of calling window.history.back(), try navigator.app.exitApp();
[10:46:04] <todd_> eh?
[10:46:12] <todd_> this iOS or Android?
[10:46:39] <rpcesar> ive noticed heaps of inconsistencies regarding dialogs and history across browsers, particularly in regards to fragments. the most consistant method we have been able to use is using window.history.go(-1) /* made a dfference between back for some reason */
[10:47:20] <agcolom> Hi! quick message before I forget: we can remove docs/pages/page-dialogs.html
[10:47:48] <agcolom> I don't know how to remove a file in github :-(
[10:48:32] <agcolom> todd_: ^
[10:49:01] <todd_> rpcesar: interesting. old skool always works.
[10:49:12] <johnbender> todd_: brutal
[10:49:13] <todd_> oh, i'll do that
[10:49:23] <todd_> agcolom ^^
[10:49:26] <agcolom> thank you
[10:49:45] <todd_> JasonDScott: this would be good for you - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4972
[10:49:55] <johnbender> agcolom: `git rm path/to/file`
[10:50:18] <agcolom> johnbender: oh thanks!
[10:51:24] <johnbender> todd_: I'm more concerned with version 1.5 or greater, where are you seeing that snippet
[10:51:28] <johnbender> recall they changed that in like 1.1
[10:57:55] <todd_> ah, need to see where I stole that from
[10:58:16] <todd_> phonegap 1.0.0 - http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.handhelds.phonegap/11844
[10:58:44] <johnbender> todd_: yah they changed that because they were monkey patching the history object
[10:59:13] <todd_> right.
[11:01:36] <johnbender> todd_: I'm going to test with newer versions
[11:01:44] <johnbender> todd_: or try to to see if it makes a difference
[11:10:34] <ryanneufeld> hola amigos? Anyone alive in here. I'm wondering if this would cause issues on IOS (my understanding is there is a bug) http://chillburn.com.au/blog/enabling-the-pinch-zoom-for-the-ipad-iphone-while-using-jquery-mobile/
[11:10:34] <bot-t> (12 hours 50 mins ago) <johnbender> tell ryanneufeld you might want to try switching the shared folder over to nfs
[11:10:35] <bot-t> (12 hours 50 mins ago) <johnbender> tell ryanneufeld the file structure wasn't too deep so I figured I would use the virtualbox shared folders, but they suck performance wise and they've been known to cause other issues
[11:10:35] <bot-t> (12 hours 50 mins ago) <johnbender> tell ryanneufeld just have to keep that in mind if we get folks who use windows and want to work on infra (though the shared folders work really well on windows)
[11:11:25] <ryanneufeld> ?tell johnbender Thanks. I'll look into that.
[11:11:25] <bot-t> ryanneufeld, Okay.
[11:11:43] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: :)
[11:11:43] <bot-t> (18 secs ago) <ryanneufeld> tell johnbender Thanks. I'll look into that.
[11:12:00] <ryanneufeld> johnbender: any thoughts on my question above
[11:12:01] <ryanneufeld> ?
[11:13:06] <ryanneufeld> it seems kinda hacky
[11:13:32] <todd_> ryanneufeld: I think that blog post is way old
[11:13:48] <ryanneufeld> yeah, april 2011
[11:13:50] <todd_> we don't disable zooming anymore. killed that at 1.0 alpha 2 or something
[11:14:13] <todd_> just use the standard viewport meta like the docs
[11:14:36] <todd_> we have a built-in fix for the iOS orientations bug. usually works unless you turn fast
[11:14:54] <todd_> just use:
[11:14:55] <todd_> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
[11:15:03] <todd_> and user zooming will work as expected
[11:15:05] <ryanneufeld> ah
[11:15:05] <johnbender> ryanneufeld: what todd_ said
[11:15:06] <ryanneufeld> okay
[11:15:09] <ryanneufeld> I'll try that now
[11:15:09] <todd_> that's what we recommend
[11:15:12] <todd_> :)
[11:15:48] <todd_> ghosts of old mistakes stay around on the web
[11:15:54] <ryanneufeld> yup
[11:16:31] <ryanneufeld> was it only iOS that has the bug?

[11:29:03] <Wilto> You’re tellin’ me, Todd. That fact ruined my presidential run.

[11:32:02] <johnbender> gs
[11:32:08] <johnbender> oops
[11:32:39] <johnbender> ugh the phonegap build pages has broken links
[11:35:33] <johnbender> todd_: "broken" in 1.6.1
[11:35:42] <johnbender> it might be there's a setting or something but I'm going to test first then ask

[11:49:17] <todd_> ok
[11:49:51] <johnbender> todd_: looks like it does have something to do with the navigator object
[11:49:54] <johnbender> looking into it a bit more
[11:50:08] <johnbender> todd_: we might have to abstract our use of window.history.back o.o
[11:54:05] <todd_> life is different in phonegap
[11:54:09] <todd_> agcolom: you here?
[11:54:45] <agcolom> todd_: yes :-)
[11:55:04] <todd_> ah, did you delete that dialog  file or should I?
[11:55:08] <todd_> can do it now
[11:55:18] <agcolom> please do :-)
[11:55:56] <todd_> ok
[11:56:28] <todd_> i need to replace all "page-dialogs.html" mentions
[11:56:40] <agcolom> todd_: no I did that
[11:56:47] <agcolom> I think!
[11:57:15] <agcolom> you can check but I did that yesterday by hand
[11:58:09] <agcolom> it was a good idea to do it by hand as I found some other menu items missing and some incorrect links as well!
[11:58:46] <agcolom> the downside is I didn't double check that I didn't miss any....

[12:23:13] <todd_> agcolom: no problem, you did all the hard work
[12:23:44] <todd_> pages probably need this treatment too or we need to document the nav stuff cleanly somehow

[12:24:09] <todd_> this just came in…can you look at this ASAP? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4978
[12:24:15] <todd_> like to fix for RC
[12:24:56] <johnbender> todd_: no response. I feel like this should be an obvious fix which makes me not want to bother anyone
[12:26:23] <agcolom> todd_: uGoMobi : I just noted this: .content-secondary .ui-collapsible-inset {
[12:26:23] <agcolom>     margin-bottom: 2em;
[12:26:23] <agcolom> }
[12:26:34] <agcolom> is this new?
[12:27:22] <agcolom> (in jqm-docs.css)
[12:30:37] <_|Nix|_> Man ... our documentation is vast ... I've been copy editing all day and I only got as far as buttons ...
[12:32:26] <johnbender> todd_: FML navigator.app.backHistory works :( :(
[12:33:04] <johnbender> todd_: I think we need to abstract our calls to window.history.back :(
[12:33:44] <johnbender> todd_: luckily there are only a few places that's an issue
[12:33:53] <todd_> johnbender: that seems like it would touch a few plugins
[12:34:10] <todd_> is that a big job?
[12:34:14] <johnbender> todd_: I don't think it's an issue on hashchange though
[12:34:19] <johnbender> todd_: no not really
[12:34:27] <johnbender> we only usit in 6 places
[12:34:31] <todd_> so it's just if you can that directly?
[12:34:48] <johnbender> not sure what you're asking :P

[12:36:09] <agcolom> todd_, johnbender,  _|Nix|_,  uGoMobi, Wilto, gseguin what do you think about creating a "pull to refresh" widget? (just an idea... that maybe would just be a container which would have the visual effect and refresh whatever it contains...)
[12:36:12] <agcolom> ?
[12:36:31] <johnbender> agcolom: that sounds like the fetchlink
[12:36:31] <_|Nix|_> I don't get it ...
[12:36:38] <johnbender> only it's a container
[12:36:43] <johnbender> so just taking a different approach?
[12:37:19] <gseguin> I like but can we make something generic enough?
[12:37:21] <_|Nix|_> Maybe something simpler, like a springy select-slider.
[12:37:27] <johnbender> agcolom: or rather you could accomplish the same thing with a fetchlink it sounds like as long as the link was to the same content and we made sure it didn't get treated as a no-op
[12:37:31] <agcolom> yes, just with the visual effect/
[12:37:49] <Wilto> I mean, the action itself could be performed by the fetchlink dealie.
[12:37:59] <johnbender> Wilto: that's what I was thinking
[12:38:01] <Wilto> Might be cool to build that as a stand-alone widget.
[12:38:06] <Wilto> But yeah, +1.
[12:38:16] <johnbender> the only thing is the no-op
[12:38:23] <Wilto> Oh, we got that swipe-to-reveal thing waiting in the wings, too.
[12:38:28] <_|Nix|_> Yeah, so, like (O     ), but when you press down on it it goes (     O) and when you let go it animates back to (O     ) ...
[12:39:12] <gseguin> I want the iOS 6 droplet animation
[12:39:15] <_|Nix|_> I guess it's really just a button, but with some funk anim ...
[12:39:17] <gseguin> nothing less
[12:39:24] <agcolom> it's because the iOS users are almost expecting this behavior
[12:40:13] <agcolom> gseguin: oh, I've not seen that yet!
[12:40:13] <Wilto> gseguin: THEY WILL SEE YOU IN COURT
[12:40:19] <Wilto> Man, it is _really_ slick.
[12:41:07] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: yes that's it...
[12:41:09] <gseguin> we can do it upside down
[12:41:14] <Wilto> ?cc
[12:41:15] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[12:41:21] <agcolom> I just thought I'd mention it before I forget!
[12:42:09] <_|Nix|_> Funny thing is, both my N810 and my N900 do that in hardware :)
[12:42:24] <_|Nix|_> That's how you lock/unlock them.
[12:42:51] <_|Nix|_> Oh, and I have, like, an E7 or whatever, and that also has that springy-slidy-lock ...
[12:43:02] <todd_> yep, fetch link would do that
[12:43:08] <todd_> well, part of the pull to refresh
[12:44:18] <_|Nix|_> Hold on ... let's not make this too complicated. Whether it's a refresh that happens when the user does the sliding thing or not may be left up to the dev, or a later version of jQM. If we only do the visual part now, we can still let devs add the refresh bit for their own apps.
[12:44:21] <agcolom> _|Nix|_: don't laugh! someone lent me an Android phone. I couldn't unlock it! My kids did no problem!
[12:44:32] <_|Nix|_> :)
[12:44:42] <_|Nix|_> That's a smile, not a laugh.
[12:45:23] <agcolom> :)
[12:45:32] <johnbender> todd_: it looks like it works fine with hashchange and I imagine it works fine with pushstate
[12:45:38] <johnbender> otherwise we would have heard about it
[12:45:41] <todd_> a drag to refresh could be a swipe down when at the top/bottom of the page >> fetch link in some content
[12:46:10] <johnbender> todd_: so I guess abstracting out the window history calls would be ok in this case where window.navigator.app is provided
[12:46:16] <_|Nix|_> todd_: How about we implement the drag bit, and emit a signal at the end.
[12:46:19] <_|Nix|_> ?
[12:46:37] <_|Nix|_> Then, devs can do whatever they want with that signal.
[12:47:05] <_|Nix|_> Later, when we're ready with the new nav, we can provide the whole enchilada.
[13:06:04] <johnbender> todd_: I sent an email to the team that works on cordova
[13:06:21] <johnbender> I just wanted to double check that my little snippet for feature detecting phonegap will work
[13:06:54] <johnbender> todd_: especially for all the different platforms
[13:07:02] <johnbender> hopefully the answer is yes and we can kill this tomorrow
[13:07:19] <johnbender> todd_: or today depending on how fast they get back to us
[13:45:07] <johnbender> todd_: alright they got back to me
[13:45:36] <johnbender> I'll try to get that finished by tomorrow morning so we can test with iOS at least
[13:45:47] <johnbender> it's apparently an artifact of honeycomb support
[13:57:53] <uGoMobi> agcolom: Re: .content-secondary .ui-collapsible-inset {  margin-bottom: 2em; } ... could be I added that to prevent collapsing of the bottom border of the navmenu and top border of the footer on short pages ... is it causing a problem?
[13:57:53] <bot-t> (7 hours 35 mins ago) <MauriceG> tell uGoMobi Hi! If you've a moment, here is the revised fiddle for header/content/footer corners in popups with edge cases. Thanks in advance and regards!
[13:59:28] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: I think you forgot the link to your revised fiddle ;)
[14:16:35] <todd_> johnbender: interesting. so they added some code to workaround a HC bug and that's braking things for iOS?
[14:24:54] <MauriceG> ?tell uGoMobi  I'm almost sure bot-t forgot it ;-)  http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/bwCsm/
[14:24:55] <bot-t> MauriceG, Okay.
[15:10:44] <johnbender> todd_: no, this is just  a separate issue that adam procter raised https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4950
[15:23:28] <todd_> I see…man, having you look at a better way would be great
[15:23:42] <todd_> what's your opinion…is this blocker territory
[15:24:16] <johnbender> todd_: kind of, though I suspect it's not much of an issue given that we haven't heard about it until now
[15:24:35] <johnbender> and it's been a problem since like phonegap 1.4 :x
[15:25:18] <johnbender> todd_: my plan is to patch it with a method and an option
[15:25:24] <todd_> ok
[15:25:37] <todd_> if you can work on it soon, let's try to get it in for 1.2
[15:25:40] <johnbender> todd_: that is, the default behavior will be retained so we don't trigger some wierd corner case in existing phone gap applications
[15:25:58] <johnbender> todd_: yah I should have it ready tomorrow morning at the latest
[15:29:46] <todd_> that is badass
[15:29:50] <todd_> thanks johnbender
[15:29:58] <todd_> after that, we're good to go for RC
[15:30:04] <johnbender> cool
[15:30:04] <todd_> i need to update the docs
[15:30:17] <johnbender> todd_: ah that reminds me I'll add that option to the phonegap docs so people know about it
[15:30:29] <johnbender> todd_: hmm
[15:30:46] <johnbender> nevermind
[15:34:50] <todd_> this is worth covering there for sure
[15:35:05] <todd_> i gotta head home. talk tomorrow
[15:35:15] <johnbender> todd_: cool
[23:35:56] <agcolom> uGoMobi: sorry I missed you yesterday evening... I found that that added a funny 2em border at the bottom of the listview menu and added a gap that did not seem to have a real purpose at the end of the menu. See for example http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-titles.html and compare with http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.1/docs/pages/page-titles.html
[23:37:07] <agcolom> however, replacing the 2em bottom border with a -1px makes it all look really neat. Was it added to add the gap here or somewhere else?
