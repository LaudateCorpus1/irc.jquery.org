[00:37:59] <uGoMobi> agcolom: you are right, -1px is more neat than 2em
[00:37:59] <bot-t> (10 hours 10 mins ago) <MauriceG> tell uGoMobi I'm almost sure bot-t forgot it ;-) http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/bwCsm/
[00:41:04] <agcolom> Good morning Jasper :-)
[00:41:09] <uGoMobi> talking about the borders in the docs... the right border of the navmenu is created with a 1px bg image and a % bg position ... often this border is not visible :(
[00:41:16] <uGoMobi> good morning Anne
[00:44:10] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Yes, I can see that as well... It is not visible on FF14
[00:44:35] <uGoMobi> depends on the window width
[00:44:53] <uGoMobi> if you resize it will become visible at certain widths
[00:45:33] <uGoMobi> I think I can replace it by a real border
[00:45:51] <uGoMobi> instead of bg img
[00:46:12] <agcolom> yes that's what I was going to suggest as well... I can see it in Safari though
[00:47:12] <agcolom> uGoMobi: ah yes, I can see it appear and disappear in Safari...
[00:47:17] <agcolom> sorry in FF!
[00:47:30] <agcolom> Always there is Safari, appear/disappear in FF!
[00:50:02] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Can I give you some notes (2 or 3 lines) to add for me to the meeting notes for tomorrow?
[00:50:23] <uGoMobi> agcolom: sure, will add it to the agenda for you
[00:51:23] <agcolom> Thanks :-) - Docs: wrote dialogs in api style
[00:51:49] <agcolom> - APi docs: added textinput (still need to add examples)
[00:52:07] <agcolom> Thank you very much :-)
[00:52:39] <uGoMobi> ok got it, np
[00:52:49] <agcolom> need to take alex to school now... have a nice day...
[00:53:04] <uGoMobi> thank you
[00:53:39] <uGoMobi> agcolom: take care
[03:47:57] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Hey! docs/content/content-collapsible-methods.html: Shouldn't that be $( ".selector" ).collapsible( "collapse" ); ?
[03:48:14] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... instead of .trigger( "collapse" ); ?
[03:48:23] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and the same for expand?
[03:52:13] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: ... and in docs/content/content-collapsible-events.html that should be .bind({ ... }); not .collapsible({ ... }); ...
[04:38:27] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: collapsible( "collapse" ) doesn't work
[04:38:34] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/widgets/collapsible.js#L114
[04:40:12] <_|Nix|_> uGoMobi: Oh, wow! You're doing it via signals?
[04:41:05] <_|Nix|_> That's actually not a bad idea ...
[04:41:25] <_|Nix|_> ... brings back memories ...
[04:43:29] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|_: actually I didn't write that code
[04:43:32] <_|Nix|_> ... that may not be such a good idea though, come to think of it. Signals should be triggered by the framework, not by the users of the fraemwork.
[04:44:20] <uGoMobi> why is that bad? we do the same with trigger create
[04:44:35] <_|Nix|_> I guess ...
[04:45:35] <_|Nix|_> I suppose it's about how event-driven you wanna get.
[04:45:54] <_|Nix|_> We can do everything with signals.
[04:46:17] <_|Nix|_> ... but signals are heavier than function calls.
[04:46:20] <uGoMobi> in general we prefer methods
[04:46:27] <_|Nix|_> Exactly.
[04:46:35] <_|Nix|_> I dunno why this was done with signals.
[04:46:50] <uGoMobi> could it be because of the collapsible set
[04:46:57] <_|Nix|_> I think it's the only widget that does things via signals.
[04:47:15] <_|Nix|_> The collapsible set would still work if the signal was triggered from within the widget.
[04:47:16] <uGoMobi> so you can trigger it on the set
[04:47:25] <uGoMobi> ok
[04:47:35] <_|Nix|_> You can also call a method on the set.
[04:48:10] <_|Nix|_> This is an API inconsistency IMO ...
[04:48:29] <uGoMobi> I agree
[04:48:30] <_|Nix|_> Let's talk about it when our friends across the puddle wake up ...
[04:48:50] <uGoMobi> I don't know why it is done this way, we can make the set work with method too indeed
[04:48:59] <_|Nix|_> Yeah ...
[04:49:14] <uGoMobi> I am very much in favor of consistency between all widgets
[04:49:52] <uGoMobi> makes it much easier for users too
[04:49:56] <_|Nix|_> The good news is that we can add the method API without removing this API. Collapsibles have been present in 1.1.x, right?
[04:50:08] <uGoMobi> 1.0
[04:50:23] <_|Nix|_> OK. I guess we have an API commitment then.
[04:50:53] <_|Nix|_> ... but that's fine - we can still change the docs to advocate usage via methods, while leaving the signal-based usage intact.
[04:51:00] <uGoMobi> but this wasn't in the documentation
[04:51:15] <uGoMobi> I added it in the docs for 1.1.1
[04:51:47] <_|Nix|_> That doesn't matter. We've committed to the trigger-based API as soon as we released collapsibles ...
[04:52:07] <uGoMobi> right
[04:52:14] <uGoMobi> I was trying to cheat ;)
[04:52:28] <_|Nix|_> ... and since that's already the case, I suppose it's not that urgent to add the method-based API.
[04:52:32] <uGoMobi> but yes we can change it into a method and still fire the event
[04:52:36] <_|Nix|_> Maybe an open issue with no milestone.
[04:53:26] <uGoMobi> I mentioned creating consistency between widgets earlier
[04:53:52] <uGoMobi> that was more about options
[04:54:09] <uGoMobi> but we can add that to the roadmap
[04:54:12] <_|Nix|_> Actually, the correct way to do it would be to implement _setOption for the collapsed option, and provide convenience methods expand() and collapse() which basically call this._setOption( "collapsed", newValue );
[04:54:47] <_|Nix|_> ... and the option emits the signal and the default handler performs the actual work.
[04:54:59] <_|Nix|_> Really complicated, and all because of this initial implementation.
[04:55:50] <uGoMobi> that's a bit the same as we do for the create event
[04:56:01] <_|Nix|_> It's complicated enough with the disabled option and the enable()/disable() methods. Now, with "collapsed" we have a triangle: option/method/signal ...
[04:56:10] * _|Nix|_ shakes his head in disbelief ...

[06:22:15] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Docs: consistent styling for "strong" among browsers. - Jasper de Groot
[06:45:27] <agcolom> uGoMobi: Hi! quick question: Do you see a funny 1px extra border above the <th> elements when viewing this page with Chrome? http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions.html (pop, flip, turn, etc... )
[06:46:00] <uGoMobi> agcolom: yes
[06:46:29] <agcolom> is this a bug with Chrome? because I don't get why it's doing it!
[06:47:02] <agcolom> all other browsers seem fine...
[06:47:13] <uGoMobi> might be a mistake in docs css
[06:47:20] <uGoMobi> checking now
[06:56:11] <agcolom> great thanks! I only looked at the element inspector and I couldn't find anything obvious...
[06:56:58] <uGoMobi> has to do with border-collapse property
[06:57:11] <agcolom> oh! well done!
[06:57:55] <uGoMobi> not sure why the style is in the html page instead of in the stylesheet
[06:58:08] <agcolom> really??
[06:58:27] <uGoMobi> is this the only page we use tables?
[06:58:35] <agcolom> no....
[06:58:48] <agcolom> I've found another one with teh same issue:
[06:59:44] <uGoMobi> ok I found 3 pages
[07:00:17] <agcolom> there this one:
[07:00:24] <agcolom> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/page-transitions-flash-workaround.html
[07:01:54] <uGoMobi> yes, and forms-all-compare page
[07:02:21] <uGoMobi> http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/forms/forms-all-compare.html
[07:02:58] <agcolom> in Chrome, also you will notice that if you move the mouse over the menu, for some links only the "highlight" sometimes misses 1 px at the bottom... Seems that some menu elements are 42px and some are 41... or is it 41 and 40??
[07:03:46] <agcolom> again this doesn't happen in FF or Safari.
[07:05:06] <uGoMobi> can't reproduce that issue
[07:05:18] <uGoMobi> will check chrome on Mac OS on browserstack
[07:07:21] <agcolom> ok, thanks, I thought it might be related.... but I guess that's not of high priority

[07:20:31] <todd_> catching up
[07:20:38] <agcolom> thanks :-)
[07:21:55] <uGoMobi> hmm can't select that resolution on browserstack :(
[07:22:05] <uGoMobi> it's the default for macbook
[07:22:11] <agcolom> Hey todd_ :-) Going to pickup my son from School and will go in 1.5h... (still haven't finish packing... ) Jasper has 2 lines for me for the meeting...
[07:22:29] <todd_> MauriceG: Your fiddle looks awesome (http://jsfiddle.net/MauriceG/bwCsm/)

[07:29:49] <todd_> thanks agcolom - have a good trip. wish you and your family the best.
[07:30:12] <todd_> hey uGoMobi
[07:30:33] <todd_> this is some complex css, good catch
[07:31:32] <todd_> any objections to pulling in MauriceG's popup imporvments.
[07:31:47] <uGoMobi> no not at all
[07:31:52] <todd_> demo looks good and the css he added will compress like crazy when gzipped so it won't add much overhead
[07:32:15] <todd_> is his pul up to date?
[07:32:24] <uGoMobi> is there a PR for this?
[07:33:01] <uGoMobi> only checked MauriceG his fiddles
[07:34:29] <uGoMobi> todd_: do you want to wait with removing -moz prefixed border-radius until after 1.2?
[07:40:47] <uGoMobi> same goes for box-shadow BTW, FF dropped the prefix in 4.0
[07:54:53] <todd_> thought so
[07:55:28] <todd_> guess not: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pulls/MauriceG
[07:56:12] <todd_> we'll have to ask MauriceG to make a PR
[07:56:22] <todd_> this PR will need to wait, maybe until 1.3
[07:56:23] <todd_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4973
[07:56:36] <todd_> seems like a bigger change + browser support issues
[07:56:40] <todd_> looks great tho
[07:56:56] <MauriceG> Hi all!
[07:57:43] <MauriceG> No, there is no pull until now.  Wanted to hear about uGoMobi's opinion and I don't know if with or without -moz prefixes
[07:58:03] <uGoMobi> hi MauriceG
[07:58:33] <MauriceG> hi uGoMobi
[07:58:37] <uGoMobi> todd_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4973 I agree is bigger change but I don't see browser support issue
[07:59:22] <MauriceG> todd_: There is no browser issue with the new header css. Just not supported so ignored by ie7 ..
[08:07:43] <todd_> Re; 4973, it will cause issues on old IE and WP7
[08:08:02] <todd_> MauriceG: is that IE7 or IE9/WP7.5?
[08:08:16] <todd_> hi MauriceG
[08:08:25] <MauriceG> I see no issues with ie7 / ie8
[08:08:30] <MauriceG> Hi todd !
[08:08:46] <MauriceG> #4973 is solid ;-)
[08:08:50] <todd_> I'd like to land those tweaks so let's decide on the -moz question. uGoMobi - what's your opinion there?
[08:09:08] <uGoMobi> -moz prefix is not needed
[08:09:15] <todd_> ah, that's great. your PR mentioned that IE would be affected
[08:09:55] <todd_> uGoMobi and johnbender - I'd also like to decide on this PR - https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4478#issuecomment-8496769
[08:10:04] <todd_> the proposed fix seems to work, had 2 confirms
[08:10:31] <todd_> so if -moz isn't needed, I think we're ready for MauriceG to do a PR so we can land that
[08:11:11] <todd_> on 4973 - I saw this:
[08:11:12] <todd_> Limitations:
[08:11:13] <todd_> No support for old IE and WP7
[08:11:13] <todd_> The markup for links and the title has to be in the right order to support smaller margins for text only buttons (if not, standard margins will be used).
[08:11:23] <todd_> MauriceG: you saying that's not a concern?
[08:14:18] <MauriceG> todd_: No, it is not.  ie7 and ie8 just uses the default header margins
[08:16:03] <MauriceG> todd_: and if there are two text only buttons in the header, but the links are placed after the title h1-6 tag, also the default 30% margins are used
[08:18:59] <MauriceG> todd_: ie9 looks fine btw  (all mentioned browsers tested)
[08:19:26] <gseguin> Good morning!
[08:19:35] <MauriceG> hi
[08:19:38] <uGoMobi> hi gseguin
[08:26:09] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: any reason you used .8em  and 2.5em as value for the left/right margin?
[08:33:45] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: I see the best results even with a 240px and 360px screen
[08:34:12] <MauriceG> *screen-width
[08:35:12] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: Icon only buttons are 26px width and there is 5px between the button and the edge. Was thinking 36px instead of 2.5em would be safe value to use.
[08:35:49] <uGoMobi> Not saying 2.5em causes an issue, just curious if it was based on a calculation.
[08:37:12] <uGoMobi> although maybe 5px between button and title is not enough
[08:38:45] <uGoMobi> but using pixel value instead of em prevents issues when someone sets a different font size
[08:40:25] <uGoMobi> 2.5em normally means 40px, so we could use that
[08:41:34] <todd_> eventually, we need to use more em-based sizing anyway
[08:41:45] <todd_> uGoMobi: if you concern that this will be less consistent?
[08:43:07] <uGoMobi> todd_: besides consistency my concern was more that if someone set font size 12px the button and title will collapse
[08:43:33] <uGoMobi> because the button size isn't em based
[08:45:22] <uGoMobi> in general we use em values for top and botton and pixel values for left and right
[08:45:37] <uGoMobi> so pixel value seems more safe
[08:56:29] <gseguin> todd_: anything hawt I need to pick up?
[08:57:26] <uGoMobi> todd_ johnbender : Re: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/pull/4478#issuecomment-8496769
[08:58:07] <uGoMobi> I don't think we should pull that
[08:58:28] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I am in agreement
[08:58:39] <uGoMobi> we should simply change the default of 75
[08:59:02] <johnbender> uGoMobi: I have to think about it a bit more
[08:59:06] <uGoMobi> that PR just doubles the result
[08:59:09] <johnbender> I don't recall being convinced last time
[08:59:23] <johnbender> uGoMobi: well his reponse seems to suggest that the coordinate systems are disparate
[08:59:25] <uGoMobi> johnbender: yeah, I only had a quick look
[08:59:40] <johnbender> but I'd have to play with that to see if it's true
[08:59:51] <johnbender> also, scrollTop causes a complete reflow :/
[08:59:51] <uGoMobi> johnbender: ok
[09:00:08] <uGoMobi> right
[09:00:10] <johnbender> making every gesture on the page dirt slow
[09:00:21] <uGoMobi> I am sure we can think of a better solution
[09:00:53] <johnbender> uGoMobi: worst case I think we could create a callback for people to do the calculation themselves so that the default avoids the redraw
[09:01:02] <johnbender> this  works for virtually everyone else
[09:01:38] <todd_> would this be a good one for gseguin to look at?
[09:01:56] <todd_> so the thought in to increase the tolerance a bit more?
[09:02:02] <johnbender> todd_: well kind of
[09:02:03] <todd_> think I bummed up up somewhat before
[09:02:06] <gseguin> it looks like bender and jasper are already in agreement that we shouldn't pull this one
[09:02:08] <johnbender> as I recall that doesn't fix the issue
[09:02:16] <johnbender> gseguin: well not quite
[09:02:18] <todd_> i see
[09:02:24] <johnbender> I mean using scrollTop would be really bad
[09:02:26] <johnbender> perf wise
[09:02:30] <johnbender> we need to avoid that
[09:02:54] <gseguin> k
[09:03:21] <todd_> this seems like black magic. funny it seems to work
[09:03:24] <johnbender> uGoMobi: gseguin: we can probably respond with that
[09:03:32] <johnbender> todd_: it's not black magic it makes sense
[09:03:33] <todd_> let's comment on it anyway
[09:03:46] <todd_> so it works but is bad for perf
[09:04:08] <johnbender> todd_: assuming it works
[09:04:35] <uGoMobi> it's more a work around than a fix
[09:09:09] <todd_> so do we see a way to fix it?
[09:11:22] <uGoMobi> here is a swipe test page http://jsbin.com/atahip/46
[09:11:56] <todd_> gseguin: you could just help out by looking at PRs, issues
[09:12:01] <todd_> we've been creeping back up
[09:12:52] <uGoMobi> wait... have to add content to test page so you can also scroll it
[09:14:03] <todd_> johnbender: I closed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4946
[09:14:08] <todd_> seems like his code
[09:14:14] <johnbender> todd_: yah
[09:14:22] <johnbender> todd_: just struggling to do some final testing on my fix now :/
[09:14:40] <gseguin> todd_: ok
[09:15:13] <todd_> ok johnbender
[09:15:22] <todd_> i need help with triage too
[09:15:32] <todd_> i want to get us more organized on priorities
[09:15:46] <todd_> JasonDScott: do you have time to look at this today? https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4978
[09:16:08] <todd_> 1.8.1 seems to be breaking a lot of things. it broke a bunch of the filament plugins :/
[09:17:52] <DaveMethvin> todd_: file bugs on anything that looks like it needs fixing asap, we only have about a week until 1.8.2 and we're not planning another until 1.9
[09:18:26] <todd_> ok DaveMethvin - problem is we haven't dug into our plugins to see what's up
[09:18:33] <todd_> just seeing reports come in
[09:18:46] <DaveMethvin> be sure to have them test with -git as well
[09:18:51] <todd_> seems like it made BB5 unhappy. not looking forward to debugging that
[09:18:54] <todd_> sure
[09:19:09] <todd_> you must be looking for 1.8.1 as a keyword?
[09:19:18] <DaveMethvin> naw i just poke around
[09:19:22] <todd_> you're good
[09:19:33] <DaveMethvin> I'M WATCHIN U

[11:47:04] <uGoMobi> johnbender todd_ : I am having a hard time reproducing that swipe issue on Android
[11:47:22] <uGoMobi> todd_: can you try this on iPhone http://ugomobi.github.com/swipe/ ?
[11:47:38] <johnbender> uGoMobi: hmm
[11:49:19] <todd_> i need to hop to a meeting for a while
[11:49:21] <uGoMobi> i can touch-drag scroll without swipe being triggered
[11:49:25] <todd_> check in later
[11:49:35] <uGoMobi> ok
[11:49:36] <todd_> hmm indeed
[11:51:06] <uGoMobi> also, the problem was swipe being triggered during scroll, but the fix is a change in the code that prevents scroll during swipe
[12:04:12] <gseguin> ok I can tell you one thing, it does not reproduce on ICS
[12:11:50] <uGoMobi> maybe an iOS issue?
[12:12:01] <uGoMobi> here is shorturl to test page http://goo.gl/irGhT
[12:13:57] <MauriceG> johnbender:  Hi,sorry.  Is it:  "in Android"  or  "on Android"  I've made a PR https://github.com/MauriceG/jquery-mobile/commit/7c99aaca3a503428c93437a2271b3aabc8489c1a
[12:15:29] <_|Nix|_> "on Android", IMO.

[12:15:42] <johnbender> thanks :)
[12:16:34] <MauriceG> johnbender: You're welcome - Thank you!
[12:18:26] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: can you test this page on iPhone http://goo.gl/irGhT ? Q: does "touch-drag scroll" trigger swipe?
[12:21:30] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: k
[12:21:37] <uGoMobi> thanks
[12:48:08] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: hard to explain, but if you're used to drag a page with the thumb, 90% of dragging also triggers a swipe, because the thumb makes a slightly curve when dragging
[12:51:30] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: thanks, that doesn't happen on Android
[12:53:39] <uGoMobi> at least not with my thumb :)
[12:56:03] <MauriceG> btw today is twelve five
[12:56:12] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: ^
[12:57:41] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: twelve five?
[12:57:48] <MauriceG> iPod touch with A5 dual core and iOS6
[12:58:03] <MauriceG> September 12 - iPhone 5 day
[12:58:23] <uGoMobi> ah, was actually looking at the pics right now
[12:58:38] <MauriceG> me too
[12:58:57] <uGoMobi> I was expecting more visual changes
[12:59:01] <MauriceG> my son will get crazy :-)  siri on iPod
[12:59:08] <uGoMobi> haha
[12:59:49] <MauriceG> he was hoping that iPod will get it
[13:01:56] <uGoMobi> I am happy with Google Now :)
[13:03:56] <MauriceG> You got one ? uGoMobi
[13:06:29] <uGoMobi> MauriceG: got what?
[13:06:42] <uGoMobi> iPod?
[13:06:57] <uGoMobi> I have Google Now on Jelly Bean
[13:11:26] <MauriceG> Cool!  I did  not know
[13:13:42] <MauriceG> uGoMobi:  My son and I are apple fans (at the moment).  I don't know, how this could happen  :-\ don't ask ...
[13:13:52] <uGoMobi> haha
[13:14:39] <uGoMobi> I am Google fan... I have a Galaxy Nexus now and I really like how everything syncs
[13:15:17] <uGoMobi> I can also use Chrome code inspector on desktop to inspect code of website on my Nexus
[13:15:50] <MauriceG> Yes! That's it.  Sync and iOS don't like each other ;-)
[13:16:02] <uGoMobi> or sync tabs on both mobile and desktop chrome
[13:16:07] <uGoMobi> haha
[13:16:23] <uGoMobi> it's perfect for debugging
[13:16:45] <MauriceG> yes, this sounds good, indeed
[13:20:06] <MauriceG> (btw: I think the admiral and the red leader are watching apples key note on video ;-)
[13:20:24] <uGoMobi> haha think so too

[13:25:17] <johnbender> toddmparker_: are you around?
[13:27:00] <johnbender> Wilto: you around?
[13:29:02] <MauriceG> uGoMobi: cool !   I'll tell my son!
[14:00:23] <Wilto> Am now. Whatup, johnbender?
[14:25:17] <MauriceG> Wilto: Hi, I've a linguistic question
[14:25:22] <Wilto> Hit me.
[14:26:08] <MauriceG>  We would say "headers and footers" but I've found the wording "headers and footer" min. two times in the docs. Is there as rule just to use one plural?
[15:03:49] <johnbender> Wilto: was the old school fixed header approach a plugin? or did we add it back into the library?
[15:05:55] <Wilto> Way back when, pre-qualified-fixed?
[15:06:05] <Wilto> Just built into the pages stuff, as I recall.
[15:06:15] <Wilto> Not a standalone plugin.
[15:06:29] <johnbender> Wilto: now
[15:06:48] <johnbender> Wilto: remember there was the big kerflufel about doin either static or fixed
[15:06:57] <johnbender> instead of keeping the middleground we had before
[15:18:25] <johnbender> toddmparker_: ^
[15:20:20] <Wilto> Sorry, back. The… demoting some `fixed` implementations to static?
[15:20:45] <Wilto> Sorry; feelin’ dense.
[15:21:05] <johnbender> Wilto: originally the fixed headers and footers would fade out and then fade back in
[15:21:20] <johnbender> we didn't retain that for 1.1 and there was a lot of complaining
[15:21:30] <johnbender> so I thought todd and scott created and external polyfill
[15:21:37] <johnbender> "polyfill"
[15:21:43] <Wilto> Oh, oh, yeah, that rings a bell.
[15:21:45] <johnbender> whatever you want to call it
[15:21:50] <Wilto> It’s still included, far as I recall..?
[15:21:52] <johnbender> I was asked about it today and I don't ahve the link
[15:22:02] <johnbender> Wilto: that's what I was wondering
[15:22:03] <Wilto> I know it was there when I was working on the builder.
[15:22:57] <Wilto> Yeah, pretty sure we were including it.
[15:23:07] <Wilto> I could be wrong. Todd might know better than I do.

[15:26:40] <johnbender> Wilto: ^
[15:29:44] <gseguin> Bender, your memory will save us all
[15:29:55] <johnbender> gseguin: ? lol
[15:30:42] <gseguin> I remembered that we removed it but I wouldn't have been able to find that link
[15:46:03] <todd_> hi all -what did i miss?
[16:26:13] <johnbender> todd_: not much, did you get my message about the back button fix for android?
[16:26:21] <johnbender> I'm still waiting to hear back but I think we can ship with it
