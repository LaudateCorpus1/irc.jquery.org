[07:14:46] <toddparker> good morning
[07:18:40] <uGoMobi> good morning
[07:27:03] <Wilto> GOOOOD MOR-NING JQUERY MOBILE
[07:27:35] <Wilto> I am overcaffeinated and ready to get buckwild on popup-simple
[07:57:30] <jzaefferer> what's popup-simple?
[08:44:53] <toddparker> jzaefferer: we're making a few internal changes to popup, mostly to deal with some WP7 and Android issues but also to simplify the code
[08:45:04] <toddparker> working in a branch
[08:57:42] <jzaefferer> toddparker: thanks
[08:57:59] <jzaefferer> one of these days we might get back to working on jQuery UI's popup widget - by then we need to talk!
[09:21:13] <toddparker> a popup of ryou guys would be easy…you have position
[09:21:18] <toddparker> and no nav model
[09:21:37] <Wilto> We got nav models for days.
[09:21:55] <toddparker> johnbender: i meant to ask how the BB call went
[09:22:04] <johnbender> toddparker: I wouldn't know :(
[09:22:35] <johnbender> my calendar system leaves something to be desired at this point
[09:23:36] <Wilto> johnbender: Help us. You’re our only hope.
[09:23:51] <Wilto> You mind taking a look at this failing test? I’m hitting the wall.
[09:23:58] <toddparker> i thought you or gseguin dialed in
[09:25:10] <johnbender> Wilto: the one I talked with you about yesterday?
[09:25:17] <Wilto> Yeah.
[09:25:19] <johnbender> toddparker: nope I didn't get that email until well after :(
[09:25:33] <Wilto> I _think_ I scrapped all the dependency on the animation, but I’m still missing something.
[09:25:35] <johnbender> Wilto: for sure no animation is being applied in that case
[09:25:47] <johnbender> Wilto: it might be that the popup is already open
[09:25:49] <johnbender> let me check
[09:26:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to button-data-access: http://git.io/kiSwlw
[09:26:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/button-data-access] simplify by using a callback - John Bender
[09:28:21] <Wilto> I have it hanging on “Popup focused after open.”
[09:28:35] <Wilto> I dunno if it’s worth committing what I have here; I probably botched something basic someplace.
[09:28:57] <johnbender> Wilto: the tests are order dependent
[09:29:01] <johnbender> :(
[09:29:11] <johnbender> when you refresh does it fail differently?
[09:29:34] <Wilto> Nah. It opens a test popup and then the test stops.
[09:29:44] <Wilto> Something ain’t firing somewhere. No failures up to that point, though.
[09:29:59] <johnbender> Wilto: so it fails for me on "Link that launches popup..."
[09:30:15] <johnbender> I think in both cases it's not getting the afteropen call
[09:30:16] <johnbender> err
[09:30:17] <johnbender> event
[09:30:25] <Wilto> Yeah, there’s where I was at when I just nuked the animation CSS, which made sense.
[09:30:46] <Wilto> I’m just having a hard time figuring out where this issue is coming from now that all the animation requirements have been removed.
[09:30:58] <johnbender> Wilto: there's a deferred that resolves on the animation did you remove that?
[09:30:59] <Wilto> Of note: I don’t know how computers work.
[09:31:23] <johnbender> Wilto: what was the reason for removing the default transition?
[09:31:47] <Wilto> It was responsible for an Android Chrome issue, and looked clunky in a lot of places.
[09:32:05] <Wilto> It was getting like two frames — now, that’s largely because the backdrop is so freakyhuge.
[09:32:43] <Wilto> We could work around that, but it looks like animating opacity in ICS Chrome causes one of those layering issues, the way `position: fixed` was.
[09:33:12] <Wilto> I’d rather just scratch the fade for now and simplify. It made things feel laggy.
[09:33:50] <johnbender> Wilto: I'm not clear on the css, does it still "animate" without any animation class?
[09:33:54] <johnbender> we have to deal with that I think
[09:34:11] <Wilto> No. I mean, we could have a… noop animation in there and the JavaScript could still work the same.
[09:34:22] <Wilto> Clunky, though.
[09:34:25] <johnbender> yes
[09:34:34] <johnbender> can we try it to see if that fixes the issue quickly?
[09:34:37] <johnbender> then we can work from ther
[09:34:42] <Wilto> Absolutely; five minutes.
[09:35:00] <Wilto> (Freakin’ love Git.)
[09:39:35] <Wilto> Hm.
[09:39:44] <Wilto> Okay, so something I did to fix it has markedly un-fixed it.
[09:40:37] <toddparker> i'm in favor of killing the bg fade. i will pick speed every time
[09:40:43] <toddparker> and reduced bugs
[09:42:58] <Wilto> please hold; hack mode
[10:24:32] <johnbender> Wilto: any luck?
[10:24:45] <Wilto> everything is jerks johnbender
[10:24:53] <Wilto> I’m gonna need your help here; sorry man.
[10:25:02] <johnbender> np
[10:25:07] <johnbender> adding in a noop didn't help?
[10:25:29] <Wilto> —oh damn got it
[10:25:47] <Wilto> Oh, no. I rolled back the CSS and the JavaScript part stayed busted. Rolled back both and we were good, obviously.
[10:26:00] <Wilto> I think I got it solved, but it ain’t pretty—committing, if you don’t mind having a look.
[10:26:08] <johnbender> sure
[10:26:34] <Wilto> I’ll give you a hint: the solution rhymes with “setLimeout.”
[10:27:40] <toddparker> johnbender: this is an odd one. any idea why this could be happening with 1.8

[10:29:35] <johnbender> have to check
[10:34:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to popup-simple: http://git.io/aI2GZA
[10:34:57] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-simple] Fixes timing bug introduced by removing default fade animation. - Mat Marquis
[10:35:15] <Wilto> I am not a proud man.
[10:36:33] <johnbender> toddparker: that's probably a result of that bizarre/clever chunk of code :/
[10:36:35] <Wilto> johnbender: ^
[10:37:09] <Wilto> Wow, that IS a weird one.
[10:38:20] <Wilto> johnbender: You redid things so we were only getting closest([page]) on creation, yeah?
[10:38:26] <Wilto> Is that in popup-simple?
[10:39:21] <johnbender> yes
[10:39:22] <johnbender> should be
[10:40:26] <Wilto> …huh.
[10:41:02] <Wilto> $.extend( this, { _page: thisPage, … Got it.
[10:44:55] <johnbender> Wilto: there's also another reference in there
[10:44:56] <johnbender> hmm
[10:45:00] <johnbender> might need to take that out :/
[10:46:27] <Wilto> Yeah, that’s why I asked; just saw that.
[10:46:31] <johnbender> Wilto: nevermind, I didn't make that change because I got stuck with the broken tests
[10:46:36] <Wilto> NOOOO
[10:46:40] <Wilto> okay cool
[10:46:51] <johnbender> Wilto: want me to push it real fast?
[10:46:53] <Wilto> Tagging in on that “appending 0”s issue real quick.
[10:47:03] <Wilto> Oh, that’s cool; no rush. Gonna grab a sandwich in a second anyway.
[10:47:44] <johnbender> kk
[10:47:50] <johnbender> I'll push that change
[10:49:49] <johnbender> Wilto: pushed
[10:50:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to popup-simple: http://git.io/ELMjzQ
[10:50:01] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-simple] use existing page ref - John Bender
[10:50:56] <Wilto> Sweet.
[10:52:43] <johnbender> Wilto: alright
[10:52:45] <johnbender> so what's the goal
[10:52:56] <johnbender> the default should be no animation?
[10:54:06] <toddparker> wilt - yes
[10:54:20] <toddparker> damn you autocorrect
[10:54:25] <wilt> There we go.
[10:54:27] <wilt> ?CC
[10:54:27] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[10:54:34] <toddparker> did you change your name?
[10:54:35] <toddparker> nice.
[10:57:44] <johnbender> toddparker: were you saying "yes" to my question?
[11:06:01] <toddparker> johnbender: which Q?
[11:06:18] <johnbender> what the goal of Wilto's changes were
[11:06:27] <toddparker> to popup?
[11:06:29] <johnbender> yah
[11:06:39] <toddparker> design-wise:
[11:06:39] <johnbender> I was going to dive in on defaulting it to no transition
[11:07:03] <johnbender> though I'm still not clear if we've considered disabling scrolling and resizing the overlay to fit the viewport
[11:07:09] <toddparker> - kill the bg fade to sped up performance and fix some of those z-index android issues by not using animations
[11:07:16] <johnbender> ah
[11:07:38] <toddparker> - rather than use an overlay that is the height of the whole page, add some finesse to sped it up
[11:08:13] <johnbender> toddparker: we tried it with the resize after animate and the redraw was ugly
[11:08:37] <toddparker> …if the overlay isn't transparent, check the height of the window and the height of the popup+tolerances. Whichever is larger, set the overlay to that and prevent scrolling the rest of the doc so it's more modal-like and faster
[11:08:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] Wilto pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/A7qgrw
[11:08:41] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fixes #4887 - Prevents `0` from being appended to the document when using a persistent footer with jQuery 1.8.0. - Mat Marquis
[11:09:01] <wilt> I MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY FIXED SOMETHING TODAY
[11:09:09] <johnbender> wilt: did you just borrow his fix?
[11:09:19] * johnbender checks the commit
[11:09:28] <wilt> Same idea; approached it differently.
[11:09:30] <wilt> Look okay by you?
[11:09:36] <toddparker> instead of re-sizing (cool idea BTW), just generally only show the viewport and don't allow scrolling. the desc. above to handle cases where the popup content is too tall
[11:09:38] <Wilto> Better.
[11:10:58] <johnbender> toddparker: that's was my original suggestoni
[11:11:02] <johnbender> *suggestion
[11:12:28] <johnbender> toddparker: not sure if it was globally original
[11:12:33] <johnbender> but that's what I was thinking
[11:12:37] <johnbender> Wilto: I commented on the commit
[11:12:42] <johnbender> Wilto: which browser had the flicker?
[11:12:44] <johnbender> so I can test it
[11:12:53] <Wilto> …wait
[11:12:58] <Wilto> Did I just close the wrong issue?
[11:13:12] <johnbender> nope
[11:13:17] <Wilto> Oh, oh.
[11:13:26] <Wilto> Sorry; which flicker?
[11:13:54] <johnbender> the popup screen animation
[11:14:07] <johnbender> if I'm going to work on sizing it to the viewport I'll need something to reference against
[11:14:46] <johnbender> toddparker: I think we need to make it a feature on a per popup basis
[11:14:53] <johnbender> if the popup is larger than the viewport we can't disable scrolling
[11:15:01] <johnbender> so we have to make it as large as the page right?
[11:15:20] <Wilto> Here’s where I landed, johnbender:
[11:16:15] <Wilto> Oh, wait, sorry—the fade flicker. That was older iOS, on our first-gen iPad.
[11:16:42] <Wilto> There’s usually no fade at all on most devices; just pops in after a little lag.
[11:17:03] <Wilto> If you limit the overlay to the viewport, you’re more apt to get a fade.
[11:17:12] <Wilto> Again, pretty obvious on our old iPad here.
[11:17:32] <Wilto> Trouble is: once you resize to full-page, the redraw kicks in. So that approach was out.
[11:19:01] <johnbender> Wilto: right
[11:19:12] <johnbender> toddparker: was saying we should go with the disabled scroll
[11:20:47] <johnbender> incidentally I'm not clear on the best way to do that
[11:20:58] <johnbender> body overflow: hidden?
[11:21:15] <johnbender> clueless
[11:22:09] <Wilto> Hm.
[11:22:24] <Wilto> …Let me try something in CSS real quick.
[11:22:32] <johnbender> toddparker: ^
[11:22:39] <Wilto> I’ll scope it to a class and commit it.
[11:34:46] <Wilto> Yeah, if I set overflow: hidden and max-height: 100% on .ui-page, it constrains it to the viewport but setting scrollTop still seems to work.
[11:34:58] <Wilto> Chrome, anyway. We’re gonna have to test the hell outta this.
[11:35:27] <johnbender> Wilto: agreed
[11:35:32] <johnbender> and I think it should be optional either way
[11:35:32] <Wilto> overflow: hidden could play hell with any interactable elements inside the popup, is all.
[11:35:46] <johnbender> indeed
[11:36:34] <johnbender> Wilto: I wonder if we can just disable scrolling with touchstart false
[11:36:40] <johnbender> though that has it's own issues
[11:36:50] <johnbender> Wilto: alright why don't I do the "no animation" default first
[11:36:53] <Wilto> Hm.
[11:36:58] <johnbender> and then we can talk about trying that hack
[11:37:04] <Wilto> Oh, that should be squared-away in the simple branch now.
[11:37:08] <johnbender> orly
[11:37:10] <johnbender> :)
[11:37:20] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/approval.png
[11:37:50] <johnbender> hmm
[11:37:58] <Wilto> No dice?
[11:38:12] <johnbender> what happens if someone customizes the animation?
[11:38:32] <johnbender> or just has one
[11:38:43] <johnbender> those bits will resolve early I would image
[11:38:46] <johnbender> *imagine
[11:38:52] <Wilto> oh huh
[11:39:09] <Wilto> Perhaps I was overzealous in my animation removal—I caught the popup itself too, didn’t I.
[11:39:31] <johnbender> well that and are we just nuking the screen animation all together?
[11:39:44] <johnbender> I thought it was supposed to be disabled by default
[11:39:49] <johnbender> but allowed through confi
[11:39:51] <johnbender> *config
[11:40:24] <johnbender> or has it always been _just_ fade
[11:40:30] <johnbender> goes to look at the code
[11:40:44] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: you around?
[11:41:47] <Wilto> Always been just fade, far as I know.
[11:41:53] <johnbender> kk
[11:42:36] <Wilto> Anyway: lunch. Back in ten.
[11:42:41] <johnbender> Wilto: ok
[11:53:02] <toddparker> johnbender: yeah, the overlay transition is/was hard-coded
[11:53:18] <toddparker> it's nice, but adds a lot of chug
[11:57:27] <johnbender> toddparker: yarp
[11:57:28] <johnbender> ok
[11:58:45] <johnbender> Wilto and I are ironing out the details there
[11:58:59] <johnbender> toddparker: but should be burn time on the resize adn prevent scrolling
[11:59:02] <johnbender> it could get harry
[11:59:29] <johnbender> with scroll prevention
[12:01:28] <Wilto> And back.
[12:03:55] <johnbender> Wilto: so I think we need to revert the change and just resolve the screen animation deferred for now
[12:04:13] <johnbender> one sec
[12:04:41] <Wilto> Hokay.
[12:04:45] <johnbender> well
[12:04:51] <johnbender> revert specific piece
[12:04:58] <johnbender> I can do that one sec
[12:05:04] <Wilto> Sweet.
[12:10:34] <johnbender> Wilto: that hang in the test wasn't your fault
[12:10:40] <johnbender> it was just a poorly written test :/
[12:10:45] * johnbender suspects that was his fault
[12:12:50] <Wilto> Anytime anyone says “wasn’t your fault,” I play out that scene from Good Will Hunting.
[12:17:51] <johnbender> Wilto: just sorting out a test real fast
[12:18:12] <Wilto> Don’t do this to me, johnbender. Not you, man. (sniff) Not you.
[12:21:52] <johnbender> GoodWiltoHunting: pushed
[12:22:04] <GoodWiltoHunting> Sweet.
[12:22:26] <johnbender> Wilto: nevermind
[12:22:31] <johnbender> the tests are failing like crazy
[12:22:32] <Wilto> Sour.
[12:22:33] <johnbender> sigh
[12:22:40] <johnbender> ah
[12:22:43] <johnbender> silly John
[12:22:46] <johnbender> bind's are for kids
[12:22:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] johnbender pushed 1 new commit to popup-simple: http://git.io/VRyGNA
[12:22:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-simple] resolve the screen deferred immediately - John Bender
[12:23:06] <johnbender> problem solved
[12:24:11] <johnbender> lol or not
[12:26:05] <toddparker> nice work johnbender
[12:26:32] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: you looking for me?
[12:26:59] <DaveMethvin> there's still time for us to add breaking changes to 1.8.1 if you need some
[12:29:41] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: just wanted to pass along two pages for profiling
[12:29:49] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: http://jsbin.com/ahisug/1
[12:29:50] <DaveMethvin> oh boy
[12:30:05] <johnbender> http://jsbin.com/ahisug/2
[12:30:07] <johnbender> the second one
[12:30:21] <johnbender> is just a switch to $.data from $.fn.data in button markup
[12:31:04] <johnbender> in the first ($.fn.data) the calls to $.fn.data take up about a quarter of the execution time according to my eyeballs on the weighted output from chrome
[12:31:16] <johnbender> kinblas: suspects that's because it triggers events?
[12:31:22] <johnbender> I haven't taken a deep look
[12:31:35] <johnbender> anyway the switch cut the time spend in $.data in half
[12:32:27] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I can walk you through what it's doing since it's not exactly obvious :/
[12:32:43] <johnbender> buried in a popup issue right now though
[12:49:15] <Wilto> whaaaat
[12:49:59] <Wilto> The switch to $.data from $.fn.data cut the time in half!?
[12:51:03] <toddparker> woah. are we using $.data in a lot of places elsewhere?
[12:54:10] <Wilto> Todd: Looks like the only instance of $.fn.data is in the docs.
[12:54:32] <johnbender> Wilto: buttonMarkup uses $().data()
[12:54:37] <johnbender> so many times ..
[12:54:48] <johnbender> I made small hack change to jqmData to return the object for dot refs
[12:55:04] <Wilto> Oh, oh.
[12:55:07] <johnbender> just to make the comparison less muddy
[12:55:34] <johnbender> Wilto: and it cut the execution time _spent in $.fn.data_ in half
[12:55:37] <Wilto> well I mean this “buttonmarkup” you speak of probably isn’t terribly important right
[12:55:40] <Wilto> Oh, right, right.
[12:55:46] <johnbender> lol
[12:55:47] <johnbender> yes
[12:55:48] <Wilto> Not like… jQM is twice as fast now, or anything.
[12:55:53] <johnbender> lol
[12:55:54] <Wilto> OR IS IT
[12:56:21] <johnbender> but it shaved a quarter of the execution time off the long link list test page
[12:56:27] <johnbender> err
[12:56:31] <johnbender> not a quarter
[12:56:34] <johnbender> and 1/8th
[12:58:21] <johnbender> the calls to data are taking up a quarter of the time in that page
[12:58:27] <johnbender> unless I'm reading the chrome output wrong
[12:58:32] <johnbender> (newish to it)
[12:58:54] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: I think this from the IE profiler is pretty telling: http://wnd8.com/grab/0f59f2.png
[12:59:20] <DaveMethvin> notice how much of it is attributable to reflows
[12:59:53] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: indeed, and if I could optimize those I would lol
[13:00:00] <DaveMethvin> afaict, chrome attributes any non-javascript time to "program" so you don't see them
[13:00:02] <johnbender> (it's possible we could remove those)
[13:00:08] <DaveMethvin> but you can optimize them
[13:00:22] <DaveMethvin> take stuff out of the dom and whack it all at once for example
[13:00:31] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: whack it?
[13:00:37] <DaveMethvin> manipulate
[13:00:39] <johnbender> ah
[13:00:47] <johnbender> definitely have to take a look at that
[13:00:51] <DaveMethvin> the expense isn't the manipulation, but the reflows it causes
[13:01:02] <Wilto> Oh, yeah, I was reading something about that recently…
[13:01:02] <johnbender> hmm
[13:01:43] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: that assumes we can optimize those 4 calls
[13:01:50] <johnbender> (entirely possible)
[13:02:04] <johnbender> but it's not as though 25ms is trivial against 100ms
[13:02:35] <johnbender> hmm
[13:02:36] <johnbender> nevermind
[13:02:38] <johnbender> callcount lol
[13:03:34] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: which version of IE are you looking at?
[13:04:07] <DaveMethvin> ie9
[13:04:45] * johnbender makes a note
[13:05:06] <Wilto> what’s ie is that new
[13:05:30] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: I'll take a look at where those offset calls are coming from
[13:05:47] <DaveMethvin> johnbender: they're inside any position measurements
[13:05:54] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: right
[13:06:03] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: was this just a refresh?
[13:06:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah
[13:06:17] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: and what does inclusive time represent
[13:06:51] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: including all child function calls?
[13:07:12] <johnbender> vs exclusive time being the time just spent inside the function itself
[13:07:15] <DaveMethvin> yeah inclusive is including any functions down the tree
[13:07:17] <uGoMobi> Wilto: do you have a Android 4.1 device there?
[13:07:22] <DaveMethvin> and exclusive is just that fn
[13:07:24] <Wilto> Sure do.
[13:07:37] <uGoMobi> Wilto: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/4506#issuecomment-8078500
[13:07:40] <johnbender> DaveMethvin: makes sense re, trigger
[13:08:00] <uGoMobi> do you see Chrome's outline on our text inputs in the docs?
[13:08:13] <DaveMethvin> the tree view is interesting as well
[13:15:58] <johnbender> Wilto: weird navigation issue is holding up my popup testing
[13:16:04] <johnbender> and I've got a dr's apt
[13:16:05] <Wilto> Uh oh.
[13:16:09] <johnbender> I'll have to get back to it
[13:16:16] <Wilto> Can I look at said navigation issue?
[13:16:27] <johnbender> Wilto: well it's not an issue with the nav code
[13:16:32] <johnbender> it's an issue with reseting the popup tests
[13:19:57] <Wilto> Doesn’t exactly sound like my wheelhouse.
[13:20:20] <johnbender> I think I've got it covered
[13:20:28] <Wilto> oh thank god
[13:21:47] <johnbender> Wilto: yah it's just a timing issue with when popupafterclose is called vs the navigate event of going backward
[13:21:54] <Wilto> uGoMobi: Not seeing that issue in the docs—at least, on a Nexus 7. Haven’t noticed it on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus.
[13:21:59] <Wilto> … either, I mean.
[13:22:17] <Wilto> I can comment; this calls for a test case, I feel. It could be a device-specific thing.
[13:22:57] <johnbender> Wilto: ah, it's because without a transition the close is instant and it comes before the hash handling
[13:22:58] <uGoMobi> Wilto: ok thanks
[13:23:04] <johnbender> hrm
[13:23:11] <johnbender> well
[13:23:24] <johnbender> in either case the close event is going to be before the navigation finishes
[13:23:42] <johnbender> that seems wrong :(
[13:23:56] <Wilto> Wait, johnbender, is that the same thing I was running into that I hacked around with the setTimeouts of 0?
[13:24:06] <johnbender> in the tests?
[13:24:11] <johnbender> yah
[13:24:15] <johnbender> I took that out :)
[13:24:21] <johnbender> I'm going to push the commit in a second
[13:24:25] <johnbender> dumping a todo in there for now
[13:24:28] <Wilto> yes good thank you
[13:29:09] <johnbender> Wilto: I think before we were just getting lucky because of the animation

[13:31:42] <johnbender> Wilto: ^^
[13:31:57] <Wilto> This is why we need more GOTOs.
[13:32:19] <johnbender> Wilto: now feel free to hack around in there on the other possibilities if Todd wants to spend the time
[13:32:25] <johnbender> I hae to shower before my derma aptment
[13:33:24] <Wilto> …huh.
[13:41:55] <Wilto> Test is still hanging in Firefox.
[13:50:00] <johnbender> Wilto: you are correct
[13:50:06] <johnbender> I'll have to take a look later
[13:50:19] <johnbender> Wilto: it's not due to the popup
[13:50:22] <johnbender> it's the test
[13:50:26] <johnbender> so proceed with chrome for now
[13:53:21] <Wilto> Oh, gotcha.
[14:18:18] <toddparker> johnbender: you still here?
[14:18:50] <toddparker> been talking to Wilto about how to proceed and i think messing with the viewport scrolling to reduce the size of the overlay is going to cause issues
[14:19:21] <Wilto> I propose we disable any/all scrolling all the time.
[14:19:27] <Wilto> Please ignore me; I am very tired.
[14:19:29] <toddparker> so i'd like to have him finish up the few bug fixes in that popup branch, like accommodating popups longer than the page, and get tests in good shape
[14:19:49] <toddparker> after that, we'll do some hardcore testing tomorrow and try to land this
[14:20:10] <toddparker> i think doing much more re-factoring is going to be time consuming and risky unless you see low hanging fruit
[15:53:56] <johnbender> toddparker: finally back
[15:54:18] <johnbender> toddparker: I think you are a wise man :)
[16:14:52] <toddparker> i am indeed
[17:18:52] <johnbender> Wilto: tests fixed
