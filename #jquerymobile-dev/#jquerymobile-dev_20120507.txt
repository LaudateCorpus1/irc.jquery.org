[07:51:29] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] corrected link to icon names [1.1.1] - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[07:51:59] <agcolom> Hi! the docs say the option to turn on autodividers is data-autodividers="true"
[07:52:14] <agcolom> but the example has data-autodividers="alpha"
[07:52:34] <agcolom> The consistency police is not happy :)
[07:54:34] <agcolom> they both work, so maybe there are more options and we need to add that to the docs? and if that's the case what are the possible options?

[07:56:39] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/1.1-stable] corrected link to icon names [1.1.1] - Anne-Gaelle Colom
[08:04:48] <agcolom> wilto: Red Leader, following my questions (details above) and conducting some experiments, it looks like as long as you don't enter false as the attribute value, it will generate the autodividers... I've tried num, yes, anything, etc... here's my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/agcolom/qZGyk/13/
[08:07:42] <Wilto> Hey, sorry agcolom—got pulled away for a sec.
[08:08:16] <Wilto> Yep, pretty much anything you put in there (except `false` is gonna evaluate to `true` behind the scenes.
[08:08:56] <agcolom> ah ok, thanks.
[08:09:48] <Wilto> Anytime! For the record, if `alpha` doesn’t trigger any specific logic, we should just recommend the use of `true`.
[08:10:22] <Wilto> “Everything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler,” and all.
[08:11:12] <agcolom> yes, I'm tempted to update the example to true as alpha carry some extra meaning...
[08:13:18] <Wilto> agcolom: Yeah, took a quick look and there don’t seem to be any settable options based on that attribute. `true` it is.
[08:13:54] <agcolom> Great changing now... Thank you.
[08:14:34] <Wilto> Not at all—thank _you_. All these documentation fixes are a tremendous help.

[08:25:40] <agcolom> wilto are you a git expert? I've made a mistake! (otherwise I'll ask Ghislain this evening...)
[08:46:36] <toddparker> morning all
[08:51:34] <gseguin> good morning
[08:51:39] <gseguin> what's up agcolom ?
[08:52:13] <agcolom> I've tried to cherry-pick autodividers (I forgot it wasn't in 1.1.1!!!)
[08:52:34] <gseguin> have you pushed it?
[08:52:53] <agcolom> yes, but I had an error so it didn't work
[08:53:05] <agcolom> now git is not happy
[08:53:23] <gseguin> what kind of error did you get?
[08:54:16] <agcolom> ok, can I email you my screen commands?

[09:10:21] <agcolom> so actually I could have just removed the file because it never was in git for 1.1-stable?
[09:10:22] <gseguin> you're welcome
[09:10:41] <agcolom> time for a break!!!
[09:10:45] <gseguin> yes after unstaging it (git reset)

[13:21:50] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Hey! Is it OK if I put a bunch of commented-out console.log statements into popup? They can serve as comments, because they're fairly verbose, but when turned on, they can be really useful in debugging asynchronous sequences.
[13:26:48] <ryanneufeld> ?tell JasonDScott Do you know of any problems with BB emulators and jqm?

[13:34:47] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/popup-widget] [popup] Added commented-out console.log statements for documentation and to help track down unfavourable interactions - Gabriel Schulhof
[13:35:27] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Well, I added 'em, because it's really hard to keep them in a separate branch ...
[13:35:53] <tbenzige> the codiqa guys made a couple ios themes with ThemeRoller: http://blog.codiqa.com/2012/05/custom-ios-themes/
[13:36:39] <tbenzige> http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/index.php?style_id=20120507-151
[13:36:59] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: I'd rather we leave the comments out of the source, is there a way to externalize them?
[13:38:54] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Not easily. I tried having a branch with a diff consisting of exactly the addition of the console.log stuff, but it's impossible to disentangle code changes from console.log additions.
[13:39:18] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: As soon as you change 3 lines the branch no longer merges cleanly.
[13:40:20] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I guess I can get rid of them, or convert them to actual English language comments once I'm confident that It All Works™.
[13:41:28] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: I modified the popup interaction to minimize hashchanges ... so, for example, if you open one popup from another, it does not go back to no dialogHashKey and then forward to dialogHashKey-present.
[13:42:22] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: It now uses an event queue, and only does window.history.back() when the event queue becomes empty and there's no popup on the screen.
[13:44:37] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: ... but there are lots of possible combinations in which events can arrive, so there are lots of paths. That's why I needed to add the console.log statements - because stepping through code like that may cause events to arrive differently than if there were no breakpoints present.
[13:45:00] <johnbender> tbenzige: looks nice
[13:45:31] <johnbender> _|Nix|_: kinblas had something setup that was unobtrusive for logging events
[13:45:41] <johnbender> though I'm not sure if that has value
[13:45:43] <johnbender> in your case
[13:45:57] <johnbender> generally we shouldn't have commented code in there imo
[13:46:10] <johnbender> but I have no doubt it's a pain
[13:47:04] <_|Nix|_> johnbender: Yeah ... *sigh* ... well, I guess it's pretty good right now, so I'll take out the comments, and keep them on some other branch ...
[13:52:19] <toddparker> tbenzige: interesting
[13:52:21] <toddparker> looks nice
[13:53:12] <toddparker> hey _|Nix|_ I've been thinking about chained popups from a design eprspective
[13:53:29] <toddparker> and i think it might looks cool if we finessed it a bit
[13:54:00] <toddparker> so instead of closing one, we essentially nuke the contents of the wrapper, inject in the new popup content and transition the hight/width if needed
[14:05:48] <toddparker> sort of like how lightbox scripts look
[14:06:07] <toddparker> it would make traversing through nested lists or photos look more coherent
[14:28:00] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: K ... not bad ...
[14:28:37] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Might actually be good in terms of DOM size, too ... no need for n screens and n containers for n popups.
[14:29:04] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: As long as there is even one popup, we have one screen and one container.
[14:29:24] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: Then, we simply remove/append the next popup and adjust the height.
[14:32:31] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: ... although simply stacking them isn't too bad-looking either: http://babulina.go-nix.ca/nix/popup-stack.avi
[14:33:00] <_|Nix|_> toddparker: I like how older popups gradually fade as newer ones appear ...
