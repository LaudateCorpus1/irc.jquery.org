[05:29:55] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5992 was just typing last word of my comment ;)
[05:30:21] <uGoMobi> also.. good morning
[05:40:47] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: goodmorning
[05:41:17] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i swear i already fixed https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5986
[05:41:25] <arschmitz> i wonder if it didnt make it into 1.3.1
[05:42:04] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: though i thought it was pre 1.3
[05:42:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: was that this fix https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/be22887
[05:43:10] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: that does look like it would apply
[05:43:46] <uGoMobi> I thought that one landed in 1.3.1
[05:43:54] <arschmitz> me too 
[05:43:57] <uGoMobi> that's why we had https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5877
[05:43:58] <arschmitz> ill check
[05:44:03] <arschmitz> yup
[05:44:30] <arschmitz> oh i see the problem
[05:44:42] <uGoMobi> and I know there was an issue with an example in the Demo Center that was fixed by it
[05:44:51] <arschmitz> to make the current page function properly we dont reset the base
[05:45:08] <arschmitz> however then the new page when you go to it still has the previous base
[05:46:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: didn't johnbender's base tag refactor address this?
[05:46:23] <uGoMobi> that is only on master
[05:46:25] <arschmitz> no that was for setting a static base tag
[05:46:31] <uGoMobi> ah ok
[05:46:53] <arschmitz> i need to look and see if we can juggle them to make both work properly
[05:47:12] <arschmitz> like switch and then switch back or something lol
[05:47:20] <uGoMobi> hmm
[05:50:49] <arschmitz> not sure ill assign it to my self and take a look since i didnt the other prefetch stuff for it
[05:52:18] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5987
[05:52:39] <arschmitz> if you want to handle the css adjustments to make this work ill take care of the js
[05:52:48] <arschmitz> ( for listview )
[05:53:11] <arschmitz> im guessing since yoru working on listview in next it would be the place to do it
[05:53:36] <arschmitz> ill do the js on master and then once you merge it "Should" work
[05:56:59] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I am going to make more changes to listview JS in "next"
[05:57:15] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the things I said yesterday
[05:57:24] <uGoMobi> about not adding classes
[05:57:36] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: will work on that today
[05:57:55] <arschmitz> ok so want me to hold off on the page thing then?
[05:58:03] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: maybe good to look at the JS in "next" after that to see if there will be issues when you do this on master
[05:58:21] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: the page thing was mostly about nested listviews right?
[05:58:53] <uGoMobi> maybe I miss something here
[06:00:41] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yes mostly
[06:00:58] <arschmitz> but if im not mistaken we still refrence page in listview
[06:02:35] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: actually there is only 1 refrence left
[06:02:46] <arschmitz> and its 100% not used lol
[06:02:52] <uGoMobi> aha
[06:02:53] <uGoMobi> :)
[06:03:14] <arschmitz> so if you havent made changes yet ill do it real quick and you can merge it in?
[06:03:17] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sounds safe to me if you remove that on master
[06:03:29] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: sure, go ahead
[06:03:41] <arschmitz> cool

[06:19:23] <jqmobilecommit> 13jquery-mobile/06master 14197bac3 15Alexander Schmitz: Listview: remove all js dependancy on page
[06:19:38] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: ok thats it on the js side
[06:19:51] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: ok great
[06:20:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I'll make things work when you just add a few classes
[06:20:28] <arschmitz> perfect
[06:21:28] <arschmitz> i think the main thing to avoide is having to add things like ui-mobile-viewport, ui-mobile, ui-page
[06:22:05] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i dont see any reason why though should be needed
[06:23:41] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I think we might need them
[06:23:56] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: why is that?
[06:24:34] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: .ui-mobile and .ui-mobile-viewport isn't always the html and body element
[06:24:47] <uGoMobi> so we don't use those selectors
[06:24:56] <arschmitz> right but why does listview need them?
[06:25:16] <uGoMobi> ohh you are only talking about listviews
[06:25:21] <arschmitz> yup
[06:25:24] <uGoMobi> sorry, misunderstood
[06:25:27] <arschmitz> its ok
[06:25:28] <uGoMobi> no idea
[06:25:37] <uGoMobi> don't think we need them
[06:25:49] <arschmitz> in general i dont see why any normal widget needs those 
[06:26:14] <arschmitz> but jorn mentioned that he needed them to get it to work outside pages
[06:26:48] <uGoMobi> in a few cases we use .ui-mobile in selectors
[06:27:03] <uGoMobi> mostly for specificity
[06:27:06] <arschmitz> yeah in general i dont think its needed 
[06:27:44] <arschmitz> but im sure there are cases where it is like with subpages it makes sense
[06:28:01] <arschmitz> so custom select probably uses / needs them
[06:28:05] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:28:45] <arschmitz> anyway for listviews now it should be good with out them
[06:29:08] <uGoMobi> yes
[06:29:11] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: oh that reminds me i didnt remove any css for nested listviews if there was any specific to that
[06:29:27] <arschmitz> but im sure you will be going through it all on next anyway
[06:29:29] <uGoMobi> panels and popups are the once that require the biggest chances I suppose
[06:29:35] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:29:48] <arschmitz> panels im going to start trying to make work without pages
[06:29:54] <uGoMobi> _|Nix|__ worked on popups already I think
[06:29:59] <arschmitz> yeah i think so
[06:30:06] <arschmitz> it didnt work but does now im pretty sure
[06:30:10] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: that would be great
[06:30:20] <arschmitz> yup
[06:30:25] <uGoMobi> also if we can make them scroll independently
[06:30:31] <uGoMobi> panel and page
[06:30:48] <arschmitz> and form widgets should not depend on on page and if they do should be a real easy fix
[06:31:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: yeah would probably have to qualify support for that
[06:31:12] <arschmitz> because it will need to use toch overflow scrolling
[06:31:41] <arschmitz> which i think works on 2.3 but is real real buggy lol
[06:32:15] <uGoMobi> yeah, not eay to make that work cross platform
[06:32:27] <uGoMobi> well, first things first
[06:32:32] <arschmitz> yeah
[06:32:47] <arschmitz> scrolling regions like that is on roadmap for either 1.5 or 1.6
[06:32:57] <uGoMobi> there wasn't nested listview CSS BTW
[06:33:02] <arschmitz> cool
[06:36:12] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] jquery/jquery-mobile#366 (master - 197bac3 : Alexander Schmitz): The build is still failing.
[06:36:12] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Change view : https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/compare/923a83efe2d6...197bac3aa356
[06:36:12] <travis-ci> [travis-ci] Build details : http://travis-ci.org/jquery/jquery-mobile/builds/7051874
[06:37:37] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5992#issuecomment-17720180 was just the poster not realizing only chrome renders a datepicker on type-"date"
[06:37:53] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: yeah, just saw that
[06:38:27] <arschmitz> i kinda had a feeling but you never know with people
[06:41:01] <uGoMobi> yeah, people really don't look for info or read documentation anymore, don't they... just post a one line message and wait for answer
[06:41:39] <arschmitz> i used to be on the JQM forum a LOT before i joined the team and id spend so much time just pasting in docs links 
[06:41:48] <arschmitz> because no one reads the docs
[06:41:54] <uGoMobi> exactly
[06:42:17] <arschmitz> guess im weird i generally read the entire docs for something before i start using it
[06:43:26] <arschmitz> had to read the jqm ones a few times they changed so fast back prior to 1.0
[06:43:33] <arschmitz> lol
[06:43:36] <uGoMobi> I start playing around and have docs open at the same time
[06:43:40] <uGoMobi> lol
[06:43:42] <uGoMobi> yeah
[06:44:29] <uGoMobi> but before I post a question or submit an issue I really make sure I read all info
[06:44:44] <arschmitz> i remember i had just finished reading them went to jQuery boston conf where they announced 1.0 and everything was different then what i had just read the week prior
[06:44:55] <uGoMobi> haha
[06:45:14] <arschmitz> Yeah i generally am pretty careful before reporting an issue
[06:48:28] <arschmitz> _|Nix|_: you around today?
[06:52:24] <uGoMobi> it was a public holiday in most North/West European countries yesterday, so many people are off today as well
[06:53:05] <arschmitz> yeah i knew he wasent around yesterday but he had not mentioned today so i wasent sure
[06:54:04] <arschmitz> i wish it actually meant something when the build failed like it used to lol
[06:55:07] <uGoMobi> yes, I would be really happy if we could rely on that again
[07:07:02] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5990 i think this is because they are not reliable
[07:08:11] <arschmitz> because some browsers dont properly report on this consistantly
[07:08:14] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: so $.event.special.orientationchange.orientation() isn't reliable either?
[07:08:22] <uGoMobi> I see
[07:08:53] <uGoMobi> best to use a media query, right?
[07:09:01] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: i could be wrong but i dont think so that was before i was involved 
[07:09:18] <uGoMobi> yeah, I wasn't on the team yet either
[07:09:23] <arschmitz> but we dont use it internally really i dont think and its not documented i dont belive
[07:09:52] <uGoMobi> deprecateeee
[07:09:53] <uGoMobi> :)
[07:12:13] <arschmitz> yeah im looking at code and it "should" work but theres lots of comments and warnings in there lol
[07:12:48] <arschmitz> and apparently media queries are not reliable on ios 5.1 and lower
[07:16:09] <arschmitz> uGoMobi: there is a depressingly large number of high priority bugs right now
[07:17:00] <uGoMobi> arschmitz: I know, we have to do some triage and reconsider priority tags and milestones
[07:17:08] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:17:28] <arschmitz> there are a ton that are really just widget review though
[07:18:15] <arschmitz> but we could probably consolidate some there
[07:18:30] <uGoMobi> yes
[07:18:40] <uGoMobi> we have some specific tickets
[07:18:55] <uGoMobi> and some general ones like adding destroy method
[07:19:09] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:19:25] <uGoMobi> maybe make a ticket for each widget we are going to review and close others as duplicate
[07:20:00] <arschmitz> yeah there are a bunch of ways we could look at how to best organize those tickets
[07:20:36] <arschmitz> it honestly does not make a lot of difference to me 
[07:22:34] <uGoMobi> I think most important is that all tickets have labels so when you review a widget you can easily find all issues for that widget
[07:22:43] <arschmitz> for sure
[07:22:56] <arschmitz> and all labels that apply
[07:23:01] <uGoMobi> we can do a big cleanup after 1.4 release
[07:23:15] <arschmitz> because like when i was looking at events swipe stuff was not there
[07:23:22] <arschmitz> it was all labeled swipe but not events
[07:23:39] <uGoMobi> there are many navigation tickets and they might need a more specific label like changePage etc
[07:24:00] <uGoMobi> right
[07:24:17] <uGoMobi> too many labels isn't good either
[07:24:17] <arschmitz> yeah
[07:24:32] <uGoMobi> so maybe swipe label should be removed and just use events
[07:26:47] <arschmitz> yeah i think events is specific enough
[08:04:17] <didiergm> Starting a new dev with JQM (had the order today yipee) I'll start with 1.3 but with intention to move to 1.4 asap. is there already a list of deprecated things to avoid using in 1.3 to make transition painless  or some "best practices" stuff I could read ? 
[08:11:35] <arschmitz> didiergm: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/wiki/1.4-changelog is probably the best place to look
[08:11:41] <arschmitz> we try to update it as we go
[08:12:41] <didiergm> arschmitz thanks I'll bookmark it cheers
[08:13:23] <arschmitz> didiergm: not a problem

[10:01:19] <agcolom> arschmitz: uGoMobi toddmparker johnbender _|Nix|__ Hi all, Shane Gliser is asking: Did you have a list of FAQs for JQM that you wanted addressed for the site documentation? I'll should be able to chip in soon.
[10:02:14] <agcolom> I am not too sure what is meant here... Has he been in touch with anyone about this? (He just tweeted me yesterday)
[10:02:40] <agcolom> He published a book on JQM that I added to the resources page last week.
[10:05:13] <uGoMobi> agcolom: not sure what this is about, maybe toddmparker knows
[10:05:19] <johnbender> agcolom: no clue
[10:05:34] <uGoMobi> agcolom: we have a FAQ section in the Demo Center
[10:05:44] <uGoMobi> and those aren't ready yet
[10:06:18] <agcolom> right. Yes, let's see if toddmparker knows about this...

[11:16:46] <arschmitz> agcolom: i believe all the ones that needed to be done i finished
[11:16:53] <arschmitz> but any he can think of to add are great
[11:17:13] <arschmitz> the list we had was just a starter i put together
[11:57:59] <jqmobilecommit> 01[13jquery-mobile01] 15johnbender pushed 1 new commit to 06content-widget: 02http://git.io/v3yi2A

[12:18:18] <agcolom> arschmitz: ok, thanks for the clarification :-)
[12:19:15] <arschmitz> agcolom: no problem the list thing came from a tweet from todd a while back because the page in the demos had a lot of them that were not done
[12:19:37] <arschmitz> agcolom: but i finished all those prior to 1.3
[12:20:17] <arschmitz> agcolom: most of the list was just things from my jquery Asia preso so it was easy :)
[12:23:42] <agcolom> Yes, I was not aware that there were any still to be done... It all looks great and v useful :-)
[12:23:52] <agcolom> btw will you be in Portland?
[12:23:56] <arschmitz> yup
[12:24:17] <agcolom> Fatastic! I think everyone from Mobile will be there except for Todd.
[12:24:39] <agcolom> Will be nice to catch up (and finally speak face to face :-) )
[12:24:43] <arschmitz> matt and scott jehl wont either
[12:24:54] <agcolom> oh shame :-(
[12:24:56] <arschmitz> ha ha we did in DC you just dont remember
[12:25:10] <agcolom> I don't remember speaking to you...
[12:25:20] <agcolom> Did I speak to you?
[12:25:32] <arschmitz> lol yeah we bowled together
[12:26:03] <agcolom> I saw a picture where you are behind me, I was too much into my game obviously ;-)
[12:26:25] <arschmitz> lol
[12:26:33] <agcolom> and so glad I didn't come last ;-)
[12:27:01] <arschmitz> from what i understand everyone execpt filament mike sherov and richard gibson will be there pretty much
[12:28:25] <agcolom> right. Should be really good! (except the Europeans like me will really suffer from time difference!) (As long as we can disappear for a quick nap we'll be ok ;-) )
[12:28:35] <arschmitz> lol
[12:29:16] <agcolom> btw are you a node & grunt guru?
[12:29:32] <arschmitz> dont know about guru but i use them quite a bit
[12:29:41] <arschmitz> thats actually what the issue on view was
[12:29:49] <agcolom> great! I'll be asking you tons of questions then ;-)
[12:29:54] <arschmitz> lol
[12:30:03] <agcolom> be prepared ;-)
[12:30:07] <arschmitz> lol ok
[12:30:29] <agcolom> perfect! dinner time here... have a great weekend.
[12:30:37] <agcolom> :-)
[12:30:38] <arschmitz> you too
[12:30:48] <agcolom> thank you :-) 
[12:55:18] <toddmparker> hi
[12:55:36] <toddmparker> agcolom: i had emailed shane a while back asking him to contribute FAQs
[12:56:08] <toddmparker> so just tell him to look at what's there and see if there are common things that he thinks we could explain better and add FAQs for those
[13:21:36] <johnbender> marvel at its glory https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/content-widget/tests/unit/content/content_core.js
[13:22:43] <arschmitz> johnbender: very nice
[13:22:48] <johnbender> lol
[13:22:58] <arschmitz> that looks like a pretty good set of tests
[13:22:59] <johnbender> it's so nice to be writing fast tests again 
[13:23:20] <arschmitz> yeah our tests are painfully slow
[13:23:25] <arschmitz> in general
[13:23:49] <arschmitz> if i have to run the whole quite i start it then work on something else for an hour lol
[13:27:55] <johnbender> arschmitz: I just don't run the whole suite
[13:28:06] <johnbender> arschmitz: leave that to the CI
[13:28:27] <arschmitz> johnbender: Yeah i dont normally but i was making a bunch of tests to core the other day 
[13:28:31] <johnbender> ah
[13:28:40] <arschmitz> so who knows where those would show up
[13:28:57] <arschmitz> and same thing with switching from page.sections to toolbar widget
[13:29:06] <arschmitz> causes issues all over the place
[13:29:53] <arschmitz> mostly problems with the actual tests needing to be updated 
[13:35:13] <uGoMobi> if I switch to .ui-listview > li > a in CSS and do not add ui-li and ui-btn classes in listviews anymore, do you guys think people will become mad or just happy with better performance?
[13:35:51] <arschmitz> hmm 
[13:36:03] <arschmitz> i know i have used ui-li a lot in my own stuff
[13:36:31] <arschmitz> but i think performance out weighs
[13:36:51] <arschmitz> man upgrading to 1.4 will require some work i think lol
[13:37:00] <uGoMobi> for sure lol
[13:37:03] <arschmitz> but for the best
