[07:25:04] <Wilto> Officially seceding from the jQuery Mobile project until like 1:00pm.
[09:00:43] <gseguin> good morning all
[09:12:55] <toddmparker_> morning!
[09:13:04] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin - any ideas on this one?
[09:13:05] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2066#issuecomment-2631944
[09:13:06] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2066 on jquery-mobile, reported by ryantofteland (3m, 3w ago): Select Menus won't open when pages are within FORM element
[09:13:19] <toddmparker_> see my comment - the css fix is in master, but it's not showing up
[09:13:23] <toddmparker_> in latest minified
[09:13:46] * gseguin looks
[09:14:47] <toddmparker_> my comment lays it out
[09:15:37] <gseguin> did you see the date on the bits from latest?
[09:15:54] <gseguin> toddmparker_: Date: Mon Oct 17 18:55:11
[09:16:13] <gseguin> the CDN auto deploy is not working
[09:16:23] <toddmparker_> yeah?
[09:16:29] <toddmparker_> that was what I was afraid of
[09:16:42] <toddmparker_> couldn't find that fix when I searched the code
[09:16:44] <gseguin> eddiemonge, are you here?
[09:16:53] <toddmparker_> so either i was crazy or the CDN deploy was busted
[09:16:59] <toddmparker_> wonder hw stale this code is?
[09:17:19] <toddmparker_> danheberden: maybe you have a sec to look at this
[09:17:40] <danheberden> i can in just a sec - neck deep in .it shit
[09:19:18] <toddmparker_> sure, sure
[09:24:03] <danheberden> digression, but you know when you're doing something and it's not working.. and you get to that "WTF?!" point and then you realize why and you're like OOOOOOOOOOOOOOH Duh
[09:24:05] <danheberden> yeah, that part sucks
[09:24:25] <gseguin> :)
[09:26:29] <danheberden> so what's going on todd?
[09:26:37] <danheberden> * toddmparker_ ^
[09:27:15] <toddmparker_> heh danheberden
[09:27:25] <danheberden> oh auto deploy for mobile is busted too?
[09:27:25] <toddmparker_> i live that way, every minute
[09:27:32] <toddmparker_> yeah, that
[09:27:40] <danheberden> i don't think that's using my script - i think eddie did that himself
[09:27:44] <toddmparker_> not sure when it busted but was at least a day or two ago
[09:27:45] <danheberden> i'll take a peek
[09:27:48] <toddmparker_> yeeeeah
[09:27:53] <danheberden> well 17th
[09:27:53] <toddmparker_> ok, thanks!
[09:27:57] <danheberden> that seems a bit old
[09:28:02] <toddmparker_> the 17th??
[09:28:05] <toddmparker_> of october
[09:28:11] <danheberden> ya
[09:28:15] <toddmparker_> no way
[09:28:20] <danheberden> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.css
[09:28:26] <danheberden> we put dates/last sha
[09:28:29] <danheberden> in the comments
[09:28:38] <toddmparker_> holy carp
[09:28:46] <danheberden> FEAR THE CARP
[09:28:51] <danheberden> oddly enough
[09:29:00] <gseguin> toddmparker_: that's what I was telling you
[09:29:13] <gseguin> sorry I wasn't clear
[09:29:28] <danheberden> ui is broken too :/
[09:29:38] <danheberden> guess today is gonna be an infra day
[09:29:39] <danheberden> haha
[09:30:05] <toddmparker_> nutso
[09:30:14] <kinblas> is /test/ ok?
[09:30:21] <kinblas> or is it only the latest stuff we push?
[09:30:36] <kinblas> I meant /latest/
[09:30:48] <toddmparker_> http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js
[09:30:50] <toddmparker_> is alos stale
[09:31:17] <Wilto> Still seceded from the project but I heard danheberden broke /latest and ruined the entire jQuery Mobile project forever okay bye guys.
[09:31:35] * danheberden shakes fist violently
[09:31:37] <toddmparker_> is there a date up in here?
[09:31:38] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/test/css/themes/default/
[09:31:56] <danheberden> no - the date/sha is put by the latest build scripts
[09:32:09] <toddmparker_> so we don't know if test is ok?
[09:32:13] <danheberden> (wherever the eff they are - can't find thme, heh heh)
[09:32:23] <danheberden> well test is just part of the pull, right?
[09:32:41] <danheberden> might be able to inject a date in that
[09:32:44] <toddmparker_> test is fine, at least the css file has this:
[09:32:46] <danheberden> or at least somewhere
[09:33:06] <toddmparker_> yeah, might be a good idea
[09:33:31] <toddmparker_> is ui being broken just a coincidence?
[09:34:05] <toddmparker_> rUS$1An h4ck0rz
[09:34:38] <kinblas> heh
[09:38:47] <kinblas> toddmparker_: If you get a chance today, can you load that form gallery profile page and dump the JSON from a Mango phone?
[09:38:57] <toddmparker_> sure
[09:54:26] <danheberden> here's your bug toddmparker_ https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/commit/7a65be6d88718bc6e8b30e76a37743af48eda155#L0L180
[09:54:27] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (2w, 3d ago): 2700: Step 6 Update build and makefiles
[09:55:17] <toddmparker_> ah, so it was a tweak to the files
[09:55:56] <danheberden> ya - i'll fix it
[09:57:20] <danheberden> shit this is a big repo
[09:57:59] <gseguin> yeah we've got the original design files stuck in there
[09:58:24] <danheberden> kinda disappointed github only sends out like half a meg per second
[09:58:41] <gseguin> timmywil took a shot at killing these
[09:59:49] <toddmparker_> any ideas on how to skinny down the repo = good
[09:59:57] <gseguin> I guess everyone feels a little nervous about rewritting all the commits to get rid of those ;)
[10:00:02] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile] danheberden pushed 1 new commit to master: http://git.io/H1v2JQ
[10:00:02] <jqmobilecommit> [jquery-mobile/master] Fix CSSTHME/CSSTHEME type in Makefile which was preventing build - Dan Heberden
[10:00:04] <toddmparker_> crufty old design file histories are killing us
[10:00:40] <gseguin> w00t! thanks danheberden!
[10:00:41] <danheberden> just make sure to backup first, but yeah - kill of those old commits
[10:00:58] <danheberden> http://help.github.com/remove-sensitive-data/
[10:02:52] <gseguin> toddmparker_: I can give it another try if you'd like
[10:03:48] <danheberden> let me know if you do gseguin, that'll break the current build script
[10:03:59] <danheberden> it doesn't have a failsafe for branch resets
[10:04:23] <gseguin> why would it break the build script?
[10:04:24] <danheberden> also toddmparker_ http://code.jquery.com/mobile/latest/jquery.mobile.min.js
[10:04:38] <danheberden> gseguin cuz pulling without resetting the head would fail
[10:04:43] <toddmparker_> sure gseguin
[10:04:47] <gseguin> oh ok
[10:04:49] <danheberden> gseguin not a big deal
[10:04:55] <danheberden> i just don't wanna have to rewrite any of it
[10:05:12] <gseguin> so you'd have to do a manual reset once, right?
[10:05:27] <danheberden> so i'll just go in and checkout -f `cat .git/refs/master/head` or w/e
[10:05:49] <gseguin> got it, alright, will let you know danheberden
[10:05:56] <danheberden> just don't tell Rwhitbeck - can't trust that guy
[10:06:08] <danheberden> i mean oh hai ralph!
[10:07:17] <Rwhitbeck> danheberden o_O
[10:07:27] * danheberden hugs Rwhitbeck

[10:46:02] <eddiemonge> its on timmywil
[10:46:36] <danheberden> as are all of my hopes and dreams
[10:50:02] <eddiemonge> as are all of our hopes and dreams
[11:01:44] <eddiemonge> what if the docs stay online and instead of having them be downloadable, we offer a boilerplate as the download

[11:34:39] <timmywil> i crush dreams
[11:34:49] <gseguin> hey timmywil
[11:34:55] <timmywil> hey :)
[11:35:01] <gseguin> you dream crusher!
[11:35:23] <gseguin> so regarding that size reduction on the jqm repo
[11:35:35] <gseguin> where did we leave it last time?
[11:35:53] <gseguin> wasn't there some kind of issue with the branches?
[11:36:35] <timmywil> i haven't had a chance to look into it further, but removing the design folder from the history doesn't seem to remove the 2 large .ai files from the history
[11:36:40] <timmywil> it doesn't make sense to me yet
[11:37:07] <gseguin> oh ok, well that really crushes my dreams
[11:38:10] <timmywil> i'll look into it more this weekend
[11:38:34] <gseguin> cool, thanks a lot
[11:38:48] <timmywil> np
[11:52:27] <toddmparker_> hey all
[11:52:33] <toddmparker_> back from meetings
[11:52:40] <toddmparker_> soooo, what's up
[11:52:51] <toddmparker_> gesguin - whatcha workin' on
[11:53:09] <gseguin> toddmparker_: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2871
[11:53:09] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2871 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1w, 18h ago): Expose an overlay theme option for dialogs and selects
[11:53:17] <toddmparker_> sweet. perfect
[11:53:47] <gseguin> toddmparker_: you're lucky I added gesguin (typo) as my highlighted words ;)
[11:54:07] <toddmparker_> ha. perfect
[11:54:45] <kinblas> heh
[11:55:02] <Wilto> What’d I miss?
[11:55:08] <Wilto> Did you guys fix everything yet?
[11:55:20] <kinblas> Wilto: nah we were waiting for you
[11:55:32] <Wilto> I’M ON IT.
[11:55:34] <gseguin> Wilto: we're about to release 2.0
[11:57:48] <Wilto> MY WORK HERE IS DONE.
[12:16:49] <eddiemonge> timmywil: gseguin yeah i think thats where we stopped as well. we couldnt get those files to go poof
[12:18:30] <toddmparker_> oh, hey kinblas - did you see that Wilto posted a thing about detach and how it could be a lot faster for enhancement? https://gist.github.com/938767
[12:18:46] <toddmparker_> http://api.jquery.com/detach/
[12:18:50] <Wilto> I’m still not here or anything, but yeah—what do you think of that, kinblas?
[12:19:34] <toddmparker_> hey, you didn't chime in Wilto
[12:19:45] <toddmparker_> too busy playing private detective video games
[12:19:51] <kinblas> toddmparker: you mean ripping something out of the dom first before changing it?
[12:19:52] <Wilto> OBJECTION!
[12:20:09] <kinblas> toddmparker: yeah if so, yes we used that in a few places in the past
[12:20:25] <Wilto> The evidence clearly shows that Phoenix Wright is a great game, deserving of attention.
[12:20:48] <Wilto> Ah. Not something I’ve ever messed around with, kinblas—didn’t realize it was already in play.
[12:20:50] <kinblas> toddmparker: one problem I've seen since I've been poking around is that some code assumes the element they are modifying is in the DOM, so they do things like traverse the hierarchy etc
[12:22:17] <kinblas> Wilto: in any case, yeah it's something we should do more of if we can
[12:22:56] <eddiemonge> Wilto: always taking credit for everything
[12:23:01] <toddmparker_> every little trick helps
[12:23:04] <Wilto> It is my way.
[12:23:13] <toddmparker_> you finding more places ot optimize?
[12:23:20] <toddmparker_> i owe you test results...
[12:23:37] <kinblas> toddmparker_: yeah
[12:23:41] <toddmparker_> kinblas: which page results do you want 1st
[12:23:46] <toddmparker_> 400 item list?
[12:23:47] <kinblas> I just re-wrote getInheritedTheme
[12:23:56] <kinblas> shaved 200msecs off of DroidX
[12:23:59] <toddmparker_> wow
[12:24:09] <kinblas> of course the one worry is this ...
[12:24:18] <toddmparker_> that seemed like a place where we are looking all around the dom for stuff. goodone
[12:24:20] <kinblas> a lot of these optimizations are avoiding jQuery conveniences
[12:24:34] <kinblas> not sure how folks feel about that
[12:24:55] <toddmparker_> back in my day, we have to write JS with our bare hands with sticks int he freezing cold.
[12:24:59] <toddmparker_> and we LIKED it
[12:25:12] <toddmparker_> whatever is fastest wins
[12:25:15] <kinblas> yeah, I like to go back to banging rocks too sometimes
[12:25:19] <eddiemonge> where ever possible i feel we should avoid jquery
[12:25:29] <toddmparker_> and use mootools
[12:25:33] <kinblas> eddiemonge: heh yeah
[12:25:46] <eddiemonge> unless it significantly cuts down the codebase size
[12:25:47] <Wilto> I feel good about it.
[12:25:51] <kinblas> there are  a lot of jQuery code patterns folks use that aren't that performant
[12:25:53] <eddiemonge> without too much of a performance hit
[12:26:08] <kinblas> eddiemonge: yeah that's the trade-off size vs speed
[12:26:29] <toddmparker_> woah, is WP7.5 ever going to render this 400 item page?
[12:26:36] <toddmparker_> taking like 20 seconds and counting
[12:26:42] <Wilto> Brutal.
[12:26:50] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I should've told you
[12:26:50] <toddmparker_> device feel asleep waiting!
[12:26:57] <kinblas> that test case
[12:27:01] <kinblas> it's  a one shot deal
[12:27:08] <eddiemonge> i say if the non-jquery way is under like 5% difference and is at lest double the code of the jquery way, then use the jquery approach
[12:27:12] <kinblas> load the test case, navigate to one of the pages, hit back, dump
[12:27:23] <kinblas> if you want to do another page, hit the reload button first
[12:27:28] <toddmparker_> ok, sure
[12:27:31] <kinblas> so that it clears the old perf data
[12:27:44] <kinblas> I want clean numbers for a single page
[12:28:11] <toddmparker_> still waiting on that list
[12:28:41] <kinblas> toddmparker_: I think we can get by with just the form gallery, if it can load that
[12:28:54] <toddmparker_> ok. this is disturbing tho
[12:30:06] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it might have a JS execution time limit like iOS does
[12:30:19] <toddmparker_> but no error
[12:30:27] <toddmparker_> form gallery page loaded
[12:30:33] <toddmparker_> i hit back, then dump
[12:30:38] <toddmparker_> nothing seems to happen tho
[12:30:49] <kinblas> toddmparker_: heh
[12:31:01] <kinblas> you have to wait a bit ... when it's done uploading the JSON data which is over a meg
[12:31:09] <kinblas> it should print a URL at the bottom
[12:31:15] <kinblas> that is the URL to view the data
[12:31:34] <kinblas> you may have to keep the phone awake if you are on a slow connection
[12:31:38] <Wilto> Alright, I’m disappearing again. Assume judicious use of a smoke-bomb here.
[12:31:47] <kinblas> heh
[12:32:32] <toddmparker_> nada
[12:32:48] <kinblas> grrr
[12:32:56] <kinblas> I should check where my mango phone is
[12:33:08] <kinblas> it's probably in the mail-room somewhere
[12:33:19] <toddmparker_> wait
[12:33:24] <toddmparker_> got one for the main docs page
[12:34:49] <kinblas> hey-oh
[12:34:56] <kinblas> you guys have been pushing that dump button a lot
[12:35:01] <kinblas> I just looked there are lots of files :-)
[12:35:52] <kinblas> toddmparker_: btw, I sent a note to Steve Souders asking if we can host these files on jdrop
[12:36:18] <kinblas> they can get quite huge so I want to get them living somewhere that can accomadate them better
[12:38:46] <toddmparker_> hey - added some
[12:38:47] <toddmparker_> http://shinarp.com/jqm/profile/profiler/viewer/user-profiles/
[12:39:12] <toddmparker_> not sure if 1 and 2 are the same
[12:39:19] <toddmparker_> lemme re-try the form page
[12:40:16] <toddmparker_> or does it jsut take a long time to dump?
[12:40:29] <toddmparker_> i see the docs home is 283k kinblas
[12:41:03] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it depends on the device speed and memory
[12:41:13] <kinblas> the JSON is quite big as you're noticed
[12:41:14] <toddmparker_> what is they are crap?
[12:41:23] <kinblas> Try looking at the data directly in a browser?
[12:41:27] <kinblas> lots of numbers
[12:41:41] <toddmparker_> how do i do that?
[12:42:18] <kinblas> you want to see the JSON
[12:42:25] <kinblas> or do you want the browsable version of the data?
[12:43:04] <kinblas> toddmparker_: http://shinarp.com/jqm/profile/profiler/viewer/view-profile.php?profile=20111104-1
[12:43:22] <toddmparker_> i just want the dump to work
[12:43:24] <kinblas> toddmparker_: hint, you can click on the section headers to collapse sections
[12:43:30] <toddmparker_> at least i got one dump
[12:43:53] <kinblas> toddmparker_: it does work but either the phone is slooooow and timing out or it's just taking a long time
[12:44:07] <toddmparker_> think it's timing out
[12:44:09] <toddmparker_> silently
[12:44:19] <toddmparker_> that's a problem
[12:44:34] <kinblas> what is that first profile for?
[12:44:41] <toddmparker_> homepage
[12:44:51] <kinblas> it took 3 seconds to display that page?
[12:44:51] <toddmparker_> got 2 dumps by accident
[12:44:57] <toddmparker_> hit the button a few times
[12:45:04] <toddmparker_> seems right
[12:45:09] <kinblas> that's sloooow
[12:45:35] <toddmparker_> feels more like 4-5 seconds
[12:45:43] <kinblas> ok if you hit that url above and look for $.fn.page and see it took 2817 msecs ... you can drill down from there to figure out where all the time is going
[12:45:46] <kinblas> just click on the list item
[12:45:47] <toddmparker_> yeah. js perf is horrible
[12:46:08] <toddmparker_> seems to jibe with sergey's #'s
[12:46:30] <kinblas> Aha
[12:46:36] <kinblas> is this mango?
[12:46:42] <kinblas> or wp7?
[12:46:51] <kinblas> most of it is spent in find stuff
[12:47:03] <kinblas> the sizzle querying must be kicking in
[12:47:30] <toddmparker_> mango
[12:47:35] <toddmparker_> too sexy!
[12:47:38] <toddmparker_> (sorry)
[12:47:43] <kinblas> ugh, they must not have querySelectorAll?
[12:47:53] <toddmparker_> does ie9?
[12:48:01] <kinblas> yeah IE8 had it
[12:48:05] <toddmparker_> hmm
[12:48:19] <kinblas> we're spending most of our time in $.fn.find
[12:49:14] <toddmparker_> bad news bears
[12:56:15] <kinblas> toddmparker_: so anyways, most of that time is spent in the one method for listview list items that tries to figure out if the item has an img/icon
[12:56:18] * kinblas sighs
[12:56:53] <toddmparker_> interesting
[12:58:03] <kinblas> _itemApply() is the function in case you were interested :-)
[12:59:35] <eddiemonge> which file?
[12:59:43] <kinblas> listview
[13:01:38] <toddmparker_> so if you nuke that, does it speed way up?
[13:01:45] <toddmparker_> i could test
[13:01:55] <toddmparker_> wonder if that's killing the listview test
[13:06:24] <eddiemonge> could one of you try this: https://github.com/eddiemonge/jquery-mobile/commit/ae95aba985e6e917308077d00ed5e1a0730557d1
[13:06:25] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (35.202s ago): Update js/jquery.mobile.listview.js
[13:10:01] <eddiemonge> hmm nevermind thats not right
[13:23:24] <toddmparker_> so kinblas - your mango phone never arrived?
[13:25:27] <toddmparker_> gseguin: let me know when that overlay change is in
[13:25:30] <toddmparker_> docs needs updating
[13:25:36] <gseguin> will do
[13:25:36] <eddiemonge> kinblas: try this https://github.com/eddiemonge/jquery-mobile/blob/patch-3/js/jquery.mobile.listview.js
[13:25:45] <toddmparker_> gotta remember that we have the data-attr page to keep in sync
[13:49:18] <danheberden> if anyone has a few minutes to run through the jquerymobile.com docs pages
[13:49:26] <danheberden> and run this in their consoles: $( 'a' ).map( function() { var href = $(this).attr( 'href' ); $.ajax({ url: /http/.test( href ) ? href.replace('.com', '.it' ) + '?' : 'http://jqueryui.it' + href + '?', dataType: 'jsonp', type: 'GET' } ); });
[13:49:49] <danheberden> it'd help bust up the cache for the jquerymobile.it clone
[13:50:47] <danheberden> $( 'a' ).map( function() { var href = $(this).attr( 'href' ); $.ajax({ url: /http/.test( href ) ? href.replace('.com', '.it' ) + '?' : 'http://jqueryui.it/' + href + '?', dataType: 'jsonp', type: 'GET' } ); });
[13:50:49] <danheberden> actually
[13:55:48] <Wilto> hax
[13:56:57] <aaronmcadam> what is jquerymobile.it
[13:57:18] <aaronmcadam> seems to just redirect to com
[14:06:06] <_nickel> toddmparker_: I take it the phonegap call went well
[14:06:08] <_nickel> just saw the email
[14:06:25] <toddmparker_> think so
[14:06:29] <toddmparker_> they are cool guys
[14:06:59] <toddmparker_> aaronmcadam: .it is a bunch of hacks who steal all the jQ content
[14:07:17] <toddmparker_> danheberden just figured out how to re-direct .it back to .com today
[14:07:24] <toddmparker_> he's a genius
[14:07:31] <aaronmcadam> really?
[14:07:35] <aaronmcadam> why would someone do that
[14:07:56] <aaronmcadam> google rank/ad traffic or something?
[14:07:59] <toddmparker_> not sure. been going on for years
[14:08:02] <toddmparker_> maybe
[14:08:12] <aaronmcadam> retarded :)
[14:08:48] <aaronmcadam> oh yeah hopefully get to chat to brian next week
[14:09:54] <_nickel> toddmparker_: good to hear
[14:10:01] <toddmparker_> brian leroux?
[14:10:08] <aaronmcadam> yea
[14:10:27] <toddmparker_> cool

[14:16:20] <toddmparker_> cool kinblas
[14:16:50] <toddmparker_> so do we have a good way to compare rc2 to where we are?

[14:31:20] <socialhapy> ★ Pull request on jquery-mobile by garann (3h, 56m ago): Issue #1447 - unescape entities in page titles
[14:32:04] <garann> eddiemonge: to make -1 evaluate to false and the rest evaluate to true
[14:32:09] <gseguin> eddiemonge: it's equivalent to != -1
[14:32:25] <eddiemonge> garann: ah ok. didnt know that
[14:32:38] <Wilto> It also adds a Spanish flair to one’s JS.
[14:32:49] <garann> me neither - h/t slex and Wilto :)
[14:32:53] <Wilto> Y’know, like an accent mark I’m so tired guys.
[14:33:25] <eddiemonge> it looks like you are creating a div with newPageTitle as the text, but then only return the text, discarding the newly created argument
[14:33:33] <garann> right
[14:33:36] <Wilto> Oh, we have to swap that indexOf() for $.inArray() so we don’t blow out old IE, too.
[14:33:55] <gseguin> eddiemonge: http://timmywillison.com/pres/operators/#landing
[14:34:00] <Wilto> I don’t think we’re shimming indexOf a-la-inArray, are we?
[14:34:13] <garann> string.indexOf isn't a thing in old ie?
[14:34:18] <garann> how old are we talking?
[14:34:27] <Wilto> 6/7. Maybe 8—I can’t recall.
[14:34:32] * garann has clearly been spoiled
[14:34:49] <Wilto> No, no, I’ve just… Been steeped in IE for so long, I forget what it’s like on the outside.
[14:34:58] <Wilto> I bet things make sense out there. I wonder what that’s like.
[14:35:30] <eddiemonge> gseguin: figures it would be on timmywil's blog
[14:35:38] <Wilto> But yeah, $.inArray just uses indexOf if it’s available, else loops through the array and checks for whatever it is. Pretty painless.
[14:35:52] <eddiemonge> garann: why create the element jsut to discard it? is it to strip it of html and other stuff?
[14:36:09] <garann> that's the only way to unescape entities, as far as i could tell
[14:36:25] <Wilto> Once it’s slapped into an element, it gets unescapified.
[14:36:29] <garann> Wilto: not an array, though - does that matter?
[14:36:57] <gseguin> Wilto: I think String.indexOf is fine
[14:36:59] <timmywil> String.prototype.indexOf works everywhere, Array.prototype.indexOf needs a shim
[14:37:08] <garann> http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/53xtt423%28v=vs.94%29.aspx
[14:37:12] <Wilto> Ah-hah, I’m a dumbass.
[14:37:15] <garann> yeah, that was what i thought
[14:37:22] <Wilto> THANKS GARANN
[14:37:31] <garann> haha, sorry for the confusion :)
[14:38:00] <Wilto> You’re just lucky I’m not quoting “I’m a dumbass,” “Yeah, that was what I thought” on Twitter.
[14:39:08] <gseguin> Wilto: looks like you started working on https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2871
[14:39:08] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2871 on jquery-mobile, reported by toddparker (1w, 21h ago): Expose an overlay theme option for dialogs and selects
[14:39:13] <garann> lol
[14:39:35] <garann> totes not what i meant
[14:39:55] <Wilto> Hah, I know—no worries.
[14:40:18] <Wilto> gseguin: Yeah, I fixed up an issue where no background was being set on dialog-style selects.
[14:41:06] <gseguin> ok should Dialog also take overlayTheme instead of theme ?
[14:41:21] <gseguin> or both, rather?
[14:42:53] <toddmparker_> hey gseguin
[14:43:04] <gseguin> yes sir?
[14:43:09] <Wilto> Deferring to Todd “The Ligerman” Parker on this one.
[14:43:19] <gseguin> I'm confused here
[14:43:20] <Wilto> I don’t remember where we left off with the dialog theming discussion(s).
[14:43:47] <toddmparker_> so dialogs, custom selects: small (outer wrap) and fullscreen should all use the overlay theme class for the background layer
[14:44:05] <toddmparker_> = the thing the dialog windows sits over
[14:44:11] <toddmparker_> we default to A
[14:44:24] <gseguin> yeah ui-body-a
[14:44:29] <toddmparker_> but if you set this option on the dialog wrapper or select, we pick this up
[14:44:48] <toddmparker_> by dialog wrapper, i mean the page div
[14:45:29] <gseguin> so you want both data-theme and data-overlay-theme
[14:45:48] <gseguin> should data-overlay-theme default to data-theme?
[14:46:01] <kinblas> eddiemonge: fyi I tried your patch
[14:46:17] <gseguin> toddmparker_: ^^
[14:46:26] <kinblas> it makes things slower. The key is to reduce the function calls
[14:46:32] <toddmparker_> both theme attrs exist
[14:46:40] <toddmparker_> the overlay affects the background
[14:46:45] <eddiemonge> kinblas: hm thats odd. using those selectors should actually be faster
[14:46:59] <toddmparker_> the data-theme works like it always did - it affects the content
[14:47:28] <kinblas> eddiemonge: I just tested on Android I was consitently getting 80ms total for that func, with your code I get 112ms
[14:47:30] <eddiemonge> kinblas: ok well you could use the existing code and drop the .each() and just check the length like in my code. I was actually trying two different things
[14:47:31] <toddmparker_> you can see how the small custom selects use the overlay class here in this theme
[14:47:32] <toddmparker_> http://jquerymobile.com/themeroller/index.php?style_id=20111104-151
[14:47:52] <Wilto> eddiemonge: Am I misreading, or did you globalize “paging” and “dir” here?

[14:47:53] <socialhapy> ★ Commit on jquery-mobile by eddiemonge (4m, 27s ago): code style cleanup
[14:48:02] <toddmparker_> i set content of A to pink and if you open any of the selects on that page, you'll see if has a pink wrapper
[14:48:02] <gseguin> toddmparker_: the problem is that if I replace this.options.theme at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.dialog.js#L25
[14:48:14] <toddmparker_> that should be the new overlay swatch
[14:48:24] <gseguin> by this.options.overlayTheme that messes up the inheritance
[14:48:27] <gseguin> oh ok
[14:48:48] <eddiemonge> Wilto: oh i did. i forgot to change the ; to a ,
[14:48:53] <gseguin> that's what I started on doing but for some reason I couldn't make it work
[14:49:27] <toddmparker_> so is the dialog nested inside the bg overlay container or are the siblings
[14:49:46] <toddmparker_> eddiemonge: wouldn't the unit tests catch this?
[14:49:48] <eddiemonge> Wilto: i mean i dont know what you are talking about. it looks correct in the PR
[14:49:53] <gseguin> so the ui-overlay-%%swatch%% will override the background
[14:50:07] <eddiemonge> toddmparker_: do they work on the "experiments" folder?
[14:50:30] <eddiemonge> lol its the one missing var broke my app all over again
[14:53:08] <toddmparker_> gseguin: ok, so i see that for a dialog, the parent has the overlay swatch
[14:53:22] <toddmparker_> man, i wish we could re-write this markup
[14:53:44] <kinblas> toddmparker_:  I've got rounded corners!
[14:53:57] <Wilto> I’m calling dibs on the dialogs, post-1.0.
[14:54:11] <toddmparker_> +1
[14:54:21] <toddmparker_> that'll be our project Wilto
[14:54:40] <toddmparker_> the bg with overlay theme should be a sibling, not parent of the dialog
[14:54:52] <toddmparker_> and the dialog should be in a wrapper
[14:54:54] <Wilto> If you guys could see me right now, I’ve opened a dialog in the docs and I’m doing that thing where you point at your eyes with two fingers, then at the subject in question, repeatedly.
[14:54:57] <toddmparker_> messy now
[14:55:05] <toddmparker_> so gseguin
[14:55:12] <gseguin> yes
[14:55:17] <gseguin> listening
[14:55:27] <gseguin> trying to make sense of all this
[14:55:40] <toddmparker_> the issue now is that if i set the overlay swatch to e, the auto-inheritance will kick in and make the dialog e too
[14:56:18] <gseguin> indeed
[14:57:02] <toddmparker_> gseguin: here is a very related issue we should solve at the same time
[14:57:03] <toddmparker_> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/2881
[14:57:03] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #2881 on jquery-mobile, reported by agcolom (1w, 38m ago): Inconsistent background on themeless dialogs
[14:57:33] <toddmparker_> a fiddle with different theme configs: http://jsfiddle.net/AYZNd/16/
[14:58:00] <gseguin> I mean if you replace this.options.theme by this.options.overlayTheme at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/blob/master/js/jquery.mobile.dialog.js#L25 that is the problem
[14:58:07] <gseguin> are we talking about the same thing?
[14:58:10] <toddmparker_> the way it works now is crazy
[14:58:23] <toddmparker_> well, it's all sort of part of theming in dialogs
[14:58:30] <gseguin> yeah I saw that issue as a related one
[14:58:54] <gseguin> but Anne reports it to be working in /latest
[14:58:54] <toddmparker_> click thru that fiddle and the theming makes no sense
[14:59:07] <toddmparker_> if nothing is set, overlay, toolbars and content = A
[14:59:40] <toddmparker_> if you set a theme on the page wrapper, the overlay (parent) also gets that theme = why?
[15:01:55] <gseguin> because $el.addClass( "ui-body-" + this.options.theme );
[15:02:44] <gseguin> you can change that to this.options.overlayTheme but then the inheritance is messed up
[15:03:19] <toddmparker_> yeah
[15:03:43] <toddmparker_> i think it should be a lot more predictable than it is now
[15:03:46] <toddmparker_> examples:
[15:03:47] <toddmparker_> <div data-role="dialog">
[15:03:47] <toddmparker_> overlay = a
[15:03:47] <toddmparker_> toolbars = a
[15:03:47] <toddmparker_> content = a
[15:03:55] <toddmparker_> <div data-role="dialog" data-theme="b">
[15:03:55] <toddmparker_> overlay = a
[15:03:55] <toddmparker_> toolbars = b
[15:03:55] <toddmparker_> content = b
[15:04:01] <eddiemonge> garann: would it make a difference if your title change was on line 1121 instead?
[15:04:06] <toddmparker_> <div data-role="dialog" data-theme="b" data-overlay-theme="c">
[15:04:06] <toddmparker_> overlay = c
[15:04:06] <toddmparker_> toolbars = b
[15:04:06] <toddmparker_> content = b

[15:04:57] <eddiemonge> oh. Wilto did you see my question?

[15:07:10] <garann> it shouldn't make a difference, no, but afaict the other line covered the only case where it was at risk of being escaped

[15:21:25] <gseguin> the 3rd one with data-overlay-theme="b" and data-theme="e" shouldn't look like that

[15:21:47] <jqm-jenkins-bot> * todd: Fixed code syntax issues. Thanks agcolom!

[15:45:59] <Wilto> Didn’t have a chance to say it earlier—great work on that “getInheritedTheme” business earlier, kinblas.
[15:46:27] <kinblas> Wilto: werd
[15:47:32] <Wilto> I don’t know that I’ll ever fully grasp the idea that I work in an industry where it’s like “‘EFF YEAH 200 WHOLE MILLISECONDS.”
[15:47:44] <kinblas> lol
[15:47:52] <Wilto> The future is weird.
[15:49:41] <kinblas> Wilto: I'm just chipping away ... I get 4 more optimizations like that and we save a sec
[15:50:01] <Wilto> kinblas: http://wil.to/_/awyeah.gif
[15:50:13] <kinblas> lol
[15:50:27] <kinblas> Wilto: I'm always amazed at how you and Scott always have the right images at hand
[15:50:47] <kinblas> do you guys have some sort of list at hand? you guys always come up with it so fast
[15:50:52] <Wilto> I blame Ethan. Right after he showed up, workplace communication went to somewhere around 30% animated gif.
[15:50:57] <Wilto> Oh, dude. DO I EVER
[15:51:02] <kinblas> lol
[15:51:14] <Wilto> http://wil.to/_/
[15:51:15] <Wilto> http://bukk.it/
[15:51:27] <kinblas> lol
[15:51:28] <Wilto> Mine and Ethan’s, all public.
[15:51:29] <kinblas> I have to bookmark that
[15:52:43] <Wilto> Anyway:
[15:52:46] <Wilto> ?friday
[15:52:46] <bot-t> fun fun FUN <strong>FUN</strong>
[15:52:52] <Wilto> I’m out, folks. Have a good one.
[15:53:04] <kinblas> Wilto: have a good one
